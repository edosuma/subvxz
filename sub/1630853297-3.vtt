WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:04.743
There's a conspiracy
in this country.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.441
And books like this trash

00:06.484 --> 00:09.226
only fuel the fire of hatred
for our people.

00:09.270 --> 00:10.967
The Italians back east,

00:11.011 --> 00:12.403
they don't want you
making this movie.

00:12.447 --> 00:14.057
And if I don't want to make
a different movie?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.232
Then eventually,
you're gonna have to deal

00:15.276 --> 00:17.582
with them directly, Al.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.236
Brando is the golden goose.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.064
You wouldn't have to write
any character

00:21.108 --> 00:23.066
to stand up and say,
"Ooh, that's the Godfather."

00:23.110 --> 00:24.285
I wrote him a letter.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.069
Sent him a signed copy
of the book.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.636
You never know.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.030
"Variety" needs to find
a new fucking story, man.

00:30.073 --> 00:32.075
Paramount's
not the story.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.685
You are.

00:35.818 --> 00:38.212
Congressman Biaggi,
we want to make a movie

00:38.255 --> 00:39.996
that all Italians
will be proud of.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.606
You will not make this movie
in New York.

00:41.650 --> 00:42.607
And if I have my way,

00:42.651 --> 00:43.782
you won't make this movie
at all.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.741
I know who Michael is.
Who?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.656
Al Pacino.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.310
He's not Bob Evans' type.

00:49.353 --> 00:50.833
Why don't we get
breakfast sent up?

00:50.876 --> 00:52.922
Can't, baby. I gotta
figure this New York shit out.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.315
Hey,
you're Al Ruddy, right?

00:54.358 --> 00:55.490
Look,
there's somebody important

00:55.533 --> 00:57.187
who wants to talk to you.
Get in the car.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.806
What's in Brooklyn?

02:34.850 --> 02:36.808
You'll find out.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.767
Now shut your mouth.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.783
No one comes through
this way, you hear me?

02:54.826 --> 02:55.827
No one.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
Joe, he's here.
Yeah, come in.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.970
Sit the fuck down.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.505
Do you know who I am?

03:22.724 --> 03:25.292
Specifically, no.
But with all due respect--

03:25.335 --> 03:27.642
I'm Joe Colombo.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.644
I kinda run things around here.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.691
Well, Mr. Colombo--

03:33.735 --> 03:35.650
Call me Joe.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.306
Thank you, Joe.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.090
I gotta admit,
I've never been--

03:41.133 --> 03:43.658
Listen, Al, have a drink.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.618
Yeah, okay.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.838
If I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.710
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.321
Look.

03:54.364 --> 03:56.236
You and me got a problem.

03:56.279 --> 03:57.715
If it's about my movie--

03:57.759 --> 04:00.370
I think it's best
if you hear me out first.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.067
Sure.
Here's the problem.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.373
You want to make a movie

04:03.417 --> 04:05.288
that's gonna make my people
look like animals.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.769
And that ain't gonna happen.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.423
So as a courtesy,
I brought you here

04:09.466 --> 04:11.816
to ask you a question,
man-to-man:

04:11.860 --> 04:14.602
what do you like more,
musicals or Westerns?

04:16.299 --> 04:18.258
Fred Astaire
versus John Wayne?

04:19.650 --> 04:20.782
John Wayne.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.566
Oh, yeah, me too.

04:22.610 --> 04:25.569
So stop what you're doing,
go back to Hollywood,

04:25.613 --> 04:27.919
and make
a fucking cowboy movie.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.487
Because believe me,

04:30.531 --> 04:31.880
you don't want
this kind of trouble.

04:35.492 --> 04:38.408
Joe,
I respect what you're saying.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.541
And I understand your position.

04:40.584 --> 04:42.804
But with all due respect,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.849
can I explain mine?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.811
This guy.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.900
You know,
Mickey said he had stones.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.643
Listen, Al,

04:55.686 --> 04:57.775
I want you to know something.

05:00.212 --> 05:02.563
I ain't Mickey Cohen.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.698
But to show you
that we're not like

05:07.742 --> 05:10.527
how you Hollywood people
think we are...

05:11.398 --> 05:12.877
I'll hear you out.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.490
Go ahead.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.013
Thank you.

05:19.275 --> 05:21.364
Look, I understand
that the book

05:21.408 --> 05:22.800
has not been well-received

05:22.844 --> 05:24.062
within the Italian-American
community.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.368
Well, you know.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.239
But honestly,

05:27.283 --> 05:29.372
the book is not
the movie I'm gonna make.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.895
And I can promise you
that my movie

05:30.939 --> 05:34.246
is not gonna be the book.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.248
What the fuck
does that mean?

05:36.292 --> 05:38.686
It means that my movie
is about a family

05:38.729 --> 05:41.297
that understands that
the cops, the government,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.907
the entire
criminal justice system,

05:42.951 --> 05:45.519
is prejudiced against
Italian-Americans.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.738
It's about immigrants

05:47.782 --> 05:49.392
and what they need to do
to find justice

05:49.436 --> 05:52.787
in a world that's set up
to fucking keep them down.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.530
That's my movie.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.185
I think I have a solution,
as well,

06:00.229 --> 06:02.536
to our so-called problem.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.455
I'm listening.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.847
I'd like to invite you
to come to my office

06:09.891 --> 06:12.633
at Gulf and Western
and read the script.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.855
You want me
to read the script?

06:17.899 --> 06:20.554
I do.

06:20.597 --> 06:23.383
Because honestly, Joe,
I believe that if you do,

06:23.426 --> 06:25.210
not only will you let me
make my movie,

06:25.254 --> 06:28.170
I think that you'll support it.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.302
It's a beautiful script.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.101
You smell something?

06:48.495 --> 06:50.540
What?

06:50.584 --> 06:52.586
I don't know, bad?

06:54.326 --> 06:56.111
I don't smell anything.

06:58.635 --> 07:01.246
Doesn't anybody
come and clean this place?

07:01.290 --> 07:02.987
I told the service
not to come.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.947
You know, so we could work.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.167
You might want
to rethink that, Mario.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.609
What is this?

07:15.652 --> 07:17.567
We discussed this.

07:17.611 --> 07:20.004
This is supposed to escalate.
We talked about this.

07:20.048 --> 07:22.659
Michael, he finds out
his father's not being guarded.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.313
Then he hears
the killers are coming.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.619
Then he enlists Enzo.

07:25.662 --> 07:26.924
He makes him the muscle.

07:26.968 --> 07:28.926
He thinks he's gonna be safe,
but he's not.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.101
The cops are coming,

07:30.145 --> 07:31.407
and they're in on it,
and it's worse.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.626
It's so important,
and you just rush through

07:32.669 --> 07:34.497
the whole thing.
We got a deadline.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.631
Ruddy told me
we gotta get the script in now.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.198
God, we can't let
Ruddy's arbitrary deadlines

07:40.242 --> 07:42.462
impede our artistic process.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.115
Okay, granted we're not
making anything

07:44.159 --> 07:47.423
as serious and complex
as "Hogan's Heroes."

07:47.467 --> 07:50.339
Francis,
you've done this before, okay?

07:50.382 --> 07:52.689
I want to do this right,
you know?

07:52.733 --> 07:55.344
I mean, they all think
that I write novels,

07:55.387 --> 07:57.041
so I can't do this.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.523
Hey.

08:00.567 --> 08:03.439
Listen to me.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.529
Good is always better
than fast, right?

08:06.573 --> 08:08.836
You're great.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.706
That's it.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.186
Trust the process.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.188
Let's start over, shall we?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.153
Now I smell it.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.634
Yeah.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.027
How you want
to handle this?

08:26.070 --> 08:28.072
It's a siege, Peter.

08:28.116 --> 08:31.119
We go back to the castle,
lock all the doors.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.251
I'm serious.
So am I.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.384
I am not gonna play defense.
I'm gonna counter-attack.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.646
There's gonna be blood
in the water.

08:36.690 --> 08:38.561
You call your friends
at "Variety"

08:38.605 --> 08:40.432
and see if they can help
illuminate that article.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.564
You know
where it came from.

08:41.608 --> 08:43.479
Yeah, that fucking
half-prick Lapidus,

08:43.523 --> 08:44.828
but I need to know
if Bluhdorn gave his blessing.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.047
There you go.
Thanks.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.309
Be prepared if he did.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.571
My friends won't know that.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.182
You ought to talk--
Peter. Bob.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.315
Stan.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.622
Looking good, Evans.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.059
For somebody on life support.

09:03.194 --> 09:06.154
Don't believe
everything you read, Stan.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.155
I ain't dead yet.

09:11.986 --> 09:12.987
Sheila.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.902
Cancel lunch,
hold all my calls,

09:14.945 --> 09:16.556
and I want up-to-date
development reports,

09:16.599 --> 09:17.818
production reports,

09:17.861 --> 09:19.167
and any outstanding
business affairs issues

09:19.210 --> 09:20.211
across the entire slate,

09:20.255 --> 09:21.778
and I want them now.
Bob.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.345
Anybody on the team
who's got a problem with that

09:23.388 --> 09:24.346
can start looking at
the want ads.

09:24.389 --> 09:25.826
It's Bluhdorn.
No.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.741
He's called twice.
Not now, honey.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.177
I'm sorry,
I don't have...

09:29.220 --> 09:30.787
There are only two things
that crazy Austrian

09:30.831 --> 09:32.484
gives a shit about:
making money

09:32.528 --> 09:33.921
and making more money.
I need to show him

09:33.964 --> 09:35.575
he's got a better shot
with me than without me.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.012
So give me
the big tickets, Peter.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.579
"Love Story" will be ready
for Christmas.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.406
Great. It's gonna be a hit.
I know this.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.712
What else?

09:42.756 --> 09:44.366
"A New Leaf"
is in post-production.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.541
"A New Leaf"?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.151
Bomb. What else?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.458
"Murphy's War."
"Murphy's War"? Nagasaki.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.894
Give me something real, Peter.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.504
Come on.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.593
"The Godfather"?

09:55.638 --> 09:58.772
It's not the safest bet
by a longshot.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.078
But if half the people who
bought the book see the movie,

10:01.122 --> 10:03.254
it'll make
at least $20 million.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.821
And even Bluhdorn
can't sniff at that.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.170
All right, all right.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.607
But before I double down,

10:07.650 --> 10:09.870
I need that script
tout fucking suite.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.916
And that's French for--
Right fucking now.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.659
You think it's true?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.443
You can never trust
those headlines.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.663
They probably just wanted to
put his impressive hairline

10:20.707 --> 10:23.057
on the cover.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.451
Oh, Janis Joplin died.
That's so tragic.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.193
What's tragic is ODing over
a canceled menage-a-trois

10:29.237 --> 10:31.631
with two other women.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.589
Do you ever not have
a spin on things?

10:33.633 --> 10:36.766
No.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.334
Al Ruddy's office.
Give me Ruddy.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.684
Mr. Bluhdorn, good morning.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.077
I'm sorry,
I don't have Al right now.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.514
He's in New York.
Who are you?

10:45.557 --> 10:47.690
This is Bettye McCartt.

10:47.734 --> 10:49.823
I'm Mr. Ruddy's secretary.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.302
We've spoken before.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.915
I knew a Bettye once.
She had long legs.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.307
Do you have long legs?

10:56.351 --> 10:58.179
'Cause if you do,
I need you to use them

10:58.222 --> 10:59.702
and run over
to Bob Evans' office

10:59.746 --> 11:01.399
and see if he's there.

11:01.443 --> 11:04.707
My long legs are very busy
right now, Mr. Bluhdorn.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.361
But I'll be sure
to get back to you.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.145
Busy?

11:08.189 --> 11:11.366
Listen, cupcake, I'm the CEO
of this whole fucking company.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.063
Yes, sir.

11:13.107 --> 11:16.327
Mr. Bluhdorn,
you're a very important man.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.417
I'll tell Al you called.

11:22.812 --> 11:25.380
Hey, baby, I'm so sorry.
Where's my croissant?

11:25.423 --> 11:26.686
Your what?

11:26.729 --> 11:28.122
Oh, shit, I forgot.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.385
Al, where the fuck were you?
It's been two hours.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.779
I know, listen,
I was on my way to the cart,

11:32.822 --> 11:34.258
and I got collared
by the desk clerk.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.782
Charlie Bluhdorn called.
He needed to talk to me.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.566
So? You could have called me.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.742
I know. You're right.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.570
Biaggi's making
big problems for us.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.485
Is it fixed now?

11:43.528 --> 11:46.096
I mean, I'm working on it.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.664
But listen, I'm not gonna
be able to fly back today.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.144
I gotta stay and make sure

11:50.187 --> 11:52.668
he doesn't pull the plug
on the movie.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.975
Okay. I'll stay.
I can help you.

11:55.018 --> 11:56.803
What about the Stones party
at the Chateau?

11:56.846 --> 11:58.369
I'd much rather stay
and help you.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.675
I've got ideas.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.155
Besides, I can have
one of my staff cover.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.679
You can't do that,
and you know it.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.815
I'll be home later in the week,
once I get this back on track.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.860
I gotta go. My cab's waiting.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.386
I should have called.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.432
I'm sorry.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.697
Next time, Al,
please call me.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
I was worried.
I know.

12:23.786 --> 12:26.006
Sometimes I just get lost
in this goddamn movie.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.704
Well, if you let me,
I can help you.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.011
All right?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.295
Fuck.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.695
He's on edge.
He's dodging calls.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.828
I'm telling you,
something is definitely up.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.830
Sheila,
get me Stanley Kubrick.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.832
You, where's
the "Godfather" script?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.965
You know Bluhdorn's looking
for you, right?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.749
Everyone's always looking
for me, kid.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.490
Tell Ruddy I want that script.

13:15.533 --> 13:16.970
And you never saw me.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.363
Never saw him. Bye.
Never saw him.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.281
Mario?

13:24.325 --> 13:26.762
This is beautiful!

13:26.806 --> 13:28.677
I love
the whole sequence now.

13:32.550 --> 13:33.682
Hello.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.816
It's Ruddy.
What are you eating?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.426
Salad.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.949
Look, I need the latest draft
of the script,

13:39.993 --> 13:41.995
and I need it now.
Where are you guys at?

13:42.038 --> 13:44.954
It's Ruddy.
He wants the script.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.392
Yeah, let him write it.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.872
Ruddy,

13:49.916 --> 13:51.918
these arbitrary deadlines

13:51.961 --> 13:56.183
are impeding
our artistic process.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.401
Impeding.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.577
What the fuck does that
even mean? Impeding?

13:59.621 --> 14:01.057
Mario, I took a chance on you,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.580
and if you fuck this up,

14:02.624 --> 14:04.278
I will impede you
off the picture.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.461
No, just grab it
and bring it here.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.984
To New York?
Hop on a redeye.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.333
Don't show it to anyone.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.987
I'm the only one who sees it.
Got it.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.815
Hey, did you see the "Variety"
cover this morning?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.686
Al?

14:23.688 --> 14:25.299
Okay. Shit.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.737
Al Ruddy's office.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.261
Rod Hurley. Where's Al?
Hi, Rod.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.089
Al is really busy
with "The Godfather,"

14:33.133 --> 14:35.178
but I promise you, as soon as
his schedule opens up,

14:35.222 --> 14:36.919
we will get back to you.
Thanks, Bettye.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.313
Thank you, Rod.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.315
Francoise! Hi.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.969
I'm sorry,
I wasn't expecting you.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.318
Oh, I'm just here
to pick up Al's car.

14:44.361 --> 14:48.365
Is it ready?
Of course. Yes, it is. Um...

14:48.409 --> 14:49.932
Thank you.

14:49.976 --> 14:52.456
Can I ask who was on the phone
looking for Al?

14:52.500 --> 14:54.981
Oh, that call?
That was Rod Hurley.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.591
He's an agent,
and he has a project

14:56.634 --> 14:57.940
that he wants Al to consider.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.855
Really? What project?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.248
Honestly,
I can't even remember.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.553
It's probably
one of these scripts.

15:02.597 --> 15:05.426
Al just does not have
the time to read them.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.863
Are they any good?
They're always good.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.909
Until you read them.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.914
Lovely to see you as always,
Francoise.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.359
I could get
used to this.
Mm.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.839
You know, it's ball-freezing
weather in New York right now.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.145
Yeah.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.061
I like northern California

15:32.105 --> 15:34.281
because the energy
is just different there.

15:34.324 --> 15:36.761
You know, it's, like,
very European.

15:36.805 --> 15:37.937
Mm.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.809
Well,

15:40.852 --> 15:42.767
when this is done,

15:42.811 --> 15:44.378
I'm gonna come visit you.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.904
And you will drink
the finest wine

15:48.948 --> 15:50.906
that you can ever imagine,
Mario.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.429
Mm.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.303
What, are you engaged now?

15:56.346 --> 15:59.523
Should I find a priest?
Make it official?

15:59.567 --> 16:01.961
How'd you get in here?
No one was answering,

16:02.004 --> 16:03.658
and it smelled like
there was a dead body,

16:03.701 --> 16:05.007
so the housekeeper let me in.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.096
It was obviously her first time
in here too.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.837
Well, we were very focused,
and we didn't want to be--

16:08.880 --> 16:10.752
I don't care.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.232
Where's the script?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.147
Ruddy wants the script.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.453
It's not ready yet.
That's not it.

16:16.497 --> 16:20.805
What are you--hey. Bettye?
That's not it.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.111
Don't take it!
I just did!

16:22.155 --> 16:25.419
Bettye! You get back here
right now, Bettye!

16:25.462 --> 16:26.768
Finished?

16:28.465 --> 16:31.207
Well, well, I'd never want
to be on your bad side.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.644
Sue. You never could be.

16:33.688 --> 16:34.950
How are you?
Good. And you?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.212
Good. Do you want to sit?

16:36.256 --> 16:38.867
Oh, just for a minute.
I've got a meeting.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.522
I don't think I have ever
seen you outside the Chateau.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.915
Well, I just needed
a change of scenery.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.179
I'm tired
of all the interruptions.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.397
And what's this?

16:47.441 --> 16:49.878
You're dipping a toe
into my pond?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.619
I'm just helping Al.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.403
Mm, Nicholas Aubrey.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.884
Not my client,
but a great writer.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.278
How is it?
Phenomenal.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.410
It's honest and heartbreaking.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.064
I mean,
people hate on happy endings,

17:02.108 --> 17:03.892
but he makes the pain
so relatable

17:03.935 --> 17:06.112
that you're not sad,
you're somehow relieved.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.765
Al's producing this?

17:07.809 --> 17:09.593
He's seriously
considering it, yes.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.074
Any good female roles?
The lead is amazing.

17:12.118 --> 17:13.945
I'm picturing someone
like Dyan Cannon.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.817
I like that picture.
She's my client.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.123
I know.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.863
We should keep talking.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.039
I would love to.
Okay.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.518
Mwah.
Bye.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.520
Bye.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.306
I'm just thinking out loud,

17:26.349 --> 17:29.091
but why don't we fast-track
"Plaza Suite"?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.137
I don't think Neil Simon

17:31.180 --> 17:32.834
has even started
the adaptation yet.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.183
Oh, Christ.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.011
Oh, my fucking back.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.926
Sorry to disturb you,

17:37.969 --> 17:39.710
but the "Love Story" dailies
are in and Hiller wants you

17:39.754 --> 17:41.321
to take a look at
the night exteriors right away.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.974
Tell Hiller
we can't right now.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.020
Oh, yes, we can.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.891
Sheila, tell editorial

17:46.935 --> 17:48.154
to expect us
in about 20 minutes.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.373
Thank you.

17:50.417 --> 17:52.854
Bob, we're a bit
under the gun here.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.160
Dailies can wait.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.597
Let me ask you
a question, Peter.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.599
Are you religious?

17:59.687 --> 18:01.558
When I hear Bach
or Duke Ellington.

18:01.602 --> 18:02.733
Why, are you?

18:02.777 --> 18:04.170
It mattered to my parents.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.911
I used to go to shul
with my dad.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.217
I mean, I remember, I realized

18:08.261 --> 18:10.176
that everybody there
was hoping,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.134
literally praying
that the magic was real,

18:12.178 --> 18:15.224
but for me,
it was just like a bad play.

18:15.268 --> 18:18.227
Now, one Saturday...

18:18.271 --> 18:21.143
I pretended
I was going to services,

18:21.187 --> 18:24.320
and I ducked out,

18:24.364 --> 18:27.280
and I watched my first movie
instead.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.717
"The Adventures of Robin Hood."

18:29.760 --> 18:30.979
Errol Flynn. Great movie.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.459
Oh, fuck yeah.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.939
I went in. The lights go down.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.637
Audience gets quiet, reverent.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.291
Like we're in
a place of worship.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.163
Then, the projector
starts to hum.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.686
That magical beam of light

18:42.730 --> 18:44.949
picking up all those swirls
of smoke in the air.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.299
It was like
another planet, man.

18:46.342 --> 18:49.780
And then, poof, wham.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.434
There's Robin Hood.

18:51.478 --> 18:53.175
Larger than life,
swinging from tree to tree,

18:53.219 --> 18:54.655
shooting arrows through
the ends of other arrows.

18:54.698 --> 18:57.005
It was...oh!

18:57.048 --> 18:59.616
And everybody glued
to the screen.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.183
It was magic.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.011
Real magic.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.665
I mean,
I knew right then and there

19:04.708 --> 19:06.493
that this was my calling.

19:06.536 --> 19:13.195
That darkened movie theater
became my church.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.329
Look at us now, Peter.
Look at us now.

19:16.372 --> 19:19.419
The luckiest guys in the world.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.117
'Cause we don't just worship
at the temple. No.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.379
We're the high priests.

19:23.423 --> 19:27.383
We put the magic on the screen.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.696
So you know why we have
to watch dailies right now?

19:35.739 --> 19:38.525
Well, I'll tell you.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.447
Because it's time
to go to temple,

19:47.490 --> 19:50.711
and ain't nothing
gets in the way of that.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.413
Thank God your flight
was on time.

19:57.457 --> 20:00.155
How is it?
Is it good?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.722
Seems light.
Mm.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.506
Doesn't have a second act.
What do you mean?

20:03.550 --> 20:04.986
Second act doesn't work?
What's the problem?

20:05.029 --> 20:06.944
No, I mean it doesn't exist.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.599
Act one is brilliant.
And the end works great.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.253
They just have not
figured out the middle.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.864
There is no act two.
Oh, God.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.782
Hand me that
three-hole puncher.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.398
What the hell
are you doing?

20:25.441 --> 20:27.878
Finishing the script.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.793
You know you can't
show that to Bluhdorn.

20:29.837 --> 20:31.317
It's not for Bluhdorn.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.014
It's for Joe Colombo.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.582
Mafia Joe Colombo?
Yeah.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.454
You want to show this mess
to a gangster?

20:38.498 --> 20:40.239
That's your plan?
You got a better idea?

20:40.282 --> 20:41.588
I'm not walking away now.

20:41.631 --> 20:45.331
Ruddy.
Where are you hiding Evans?

20:45.374 --> 20:47.637
And who do we have here?

20:47.681 --> 20:50.249
Bettye McCartt,
Charlie Bluhdorn.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.902
Ah, you're the one

20:51.946 --> 20:54.688
with the not-so-long
but the no-less-perfect legs.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.560
And you are the man
who's very important.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.868
And what brings you
to our fine city, Bettye?

21:00.911 --> 21:03.610
Oh, I go wherever my boss
needs me to me.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.699
Smart girl.

21:05.742 --> 21:08.354
Well, let's get a drink,
get to know each other a bit.

21:08.397 --> 21:10.312
I'm your boss too, right?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.575
Thank you, Mr. Bluhdorn.
Oh, it's Charlie.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.535
It's00 in the morning.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.580
I try not to drink
in the mornings.

21:17.624 --> 21:20.844
What,
you don't like Bloody Marys?

21:20.888 --> 21:23.064
How about a raincheck?

21:23.107 --> 21:24.631
It's a date.
Hmm.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.633
And Ruddy,
if you hear from Evans,

21:26.676 --> 21:28.983
tell him to call me.
Immediately.

21:29.026 --> 21:31.551
You got it, boss.

21:31.594 --> 21:32.726
Hey.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.815
Why's he asking me about Evans?

21:34.858 --> 21:36.817
Oh, my God.

21:39.776 --> 21:40.864
Oh, shit.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.956
Is this true?
I don't know.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.480
But something's happening.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.351
If Evans is out, then--
We're screwed.

21:52.223 --> 21:53.268
Fuck it.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.661
At least we got a script.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.053
Sure, Al.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.881
You keep telling yourself that.

21:57.925 --> 22:00.884
I can't believe you think
this is a good idea.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.364
What happens
if one of the suits

22:02.408 --> 22:03.844
sees your new
gangster friend?

22:03.887 --> 22:05.280
I got no choice.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.457
Mr. Colombo.

22:08.501 --> 22:09.850
Thanks for stopping by.
Call me Joe.

22:09.893 --> 22:10.894
Joe. Yeah.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.766
Let's head to my office.
Yeah.

22:17.945 --> 22:21.209
Oh, shit.
What are you, clairvoyant?

22:21.252 --> 22:23.385
Charlie!
Right this way, guys.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.387
Hi!
How about that raincheck?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.084
I'm thirsty.

22:27.128 --> 22:29.260
I thought you didn't drink
in the morning.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.566
No, I didn't say that.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.394
I said I try not to drink
in the morning.

22:32.438 --> 22:33.743
Sometimes I fail,

22:33.787 --> 22:35.223
and a Bloody Mary
sounds really good right now.

22:38.008 --> 22:39.749
So this is it.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.664
That's it.

22:41.708 --> 22:44.145
And you want me to read it?

22:44.188 --> 22:46.930
It's the only way you'll know
I meant what I said to you.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.940
Read it.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.420
Yeah, here.

22:58.464 --> 23:00.640
- You read it.
- Nah, I don't read fast.

23:00.683 --> 23:01.728
Well, I don't
have my glasses.

23:01.771 --> 23:04.992
Hand me the fucking script.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.062
What's this?

23:32.106 --> 23:33.237
What's wrong?

23:33.281 --> 23:35.196
The "fade in."

23:35.239 --> 23:37.154
What's that mean?

23:37.198 --> 23:39.548
Joe, "fade in"
is a script term.

23:39.592 --> 23:41.420
It means that the screen
is gonna be black,

23:41.463 --> 23:42.508
and then once the movie starts,

23:42.551 --> 23:43.813
the screen begins
to come to life,

23:43.857 --> 23:45.249
and we call that fading in.

23:45.293 --> 23:47.556
Yeah, yeah.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.297
Yeah, fade in.
Yeah, I like that.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.733
I never
knew that.

23:50.777 --> 23:51.691
There's a lot of
things you don't know--

23:51.734 --> 23:53.606
Quiet.
Let him read the--

23:59.133 --> 24:01.788
Look, Al...

24:02.963 --> 24:04.921
I ain't here
to waste your time.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.619
You're a straight shooter
showing this to me,

24:06.662 --> 24:09.230
and I appreciate that.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.537
But we still got a problem.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.103
What, Joe?
How can I help?

24:13.147 --> 24:14.191
I got this thing I'm doing.

24:14.235 --> 24:15.279
It's called the
Italian-American

24:15.323 --> 24:16.542
Civil Rights League.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.369
Our goal is to get people
to understand

24:18.413 --> 24:20.546
there ain't no thing
called the Mafia.

24:20.589 --> 24:22.156
If you make this movie,

24:22.199 --> 24:23.679
everybody's gonna be saying
that word all over the place.

24:23.723 --> 24:26.160
If I let you make this movie,

24:26.203 --> 24:28.945
I'm allowing exactly
what I'm trying to eliminate.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.991
You understand.
It's a vile word.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.428
It's just not
something that exists.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.735
Right?Yeah.

24:35.778 --> 24:38.694
Listen, this Mafia bullshit
was invented by the FBI

24:38.738 --> 24:40.870
to keep my people down.

24:42.568 --> 24:45.005
How about this?

24:45.048 --> 24:46.746
What if I get the writers
to eliminate

24:46.789 --> 24:48.269
the word "Mafia"
from the script?

24:50.401 --> 24:51.707
You want to make
a Mafia movie

24:51.751 --> 24:55.276
without using
the word "Mafia"?

24:59.367 --> 25:01.978
Really?Pazzo.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.414
I'm a serious man,

25:03.458 --> 25:05.721
and I'm committed
to making a serious movie,

25:05.765 --> 25:08.507
one that family men
like yourself can be proud of.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.682
If you want me
to change the script,

25:09.725 --> 25:11.510
I'll change the script.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.424
I respect you.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.557
And I can do that.
I'm the producer.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.124
Wait, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

25:17.167 --> 25:18.255
Calling the writers.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.735
I'm telling 'em
to search the script

25:19.779 --> 25:20.562
for the word "Mafia,"
cut it wherever they find it.

25:20.606 --> 25:22.085
No, no, no.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.566
When they'll retype
the script, it'll be gone.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.612
Look, look.

25:26.655 --> 25:27.787
You say the word ain't gonna
be in the script,

25:27.830 --> 25:29.658
that's good enough for me.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.270
Take the word out,

25:33.314 --> 25:34.794
I'll let you make your movie.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.883
It's gone.
You have my word.

25:39.189 --> 25:41.627
Congratulations.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.715
Thank you, Joe.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.500
Can I ask you something?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.241
This singer character,
Johnny Fontaine.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.721
Mm-hmm.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.636
Is he supposed to be
Sinatra?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.641
Do you want him to be?

25:55.684 --> 25:57.338
I like this guy.

25:57.381 --> 25:58.992
Come on. Let's go.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.950
I'll call you.

26:15.835 --> 26:16.792
Wow.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.054
I thought
we were having a drink.

26:18.098 --> 26:19.969
This is a salad.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.797
Yeah.

26:21.841 --> 26:25.540
McCartt.
What is that, Irish?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.237
I'm from Oklahoma.

26:27.281 --> 26:30.719
Oh, cowboys!

26:30.763 --> 26:33.461
You are a weird guy, Charlie.

26:33.504 --> 26:34.854
Mm, Charlie.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.683
I like the way you say my name.

26:40.860 --> 26:45.691
Mm.
Are you gonna shitcan Evans?

26:45.734 --> 26:46.866
A beautiful woman like you

26:46.909 --> 26:48.737
shouldn't waste
her time reading.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.652
Beautiful women
have to waste their time

26:50.696 --> 26:52.611
doing a lot of things, Charlie.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.657
Like drinking salads with CEOs.

26:58.442 --> 27:01.141
So? Is he out?

27:04.187 --> 27:07.147
Tell me what you think
about "The Godfather."

27:08.844 --> 27:12.021
Now you want
a woman's opinion.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.633
Mm.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.338
It's fantastic.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.645
The script is gold.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.690
It's gonna make you
a ton of money.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.565
Give it to me.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.742
No.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.701
I am your boss.

27:39.745 --> 27:42.748
I could make you
give it to me.

27:42.791 --> 27:46.099
You can't make me
do anything, Charlie.

28:07.381 --> 28:08.774
Paisan.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.993
Francis, what I've read
so far is great.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.953
It's not done yet.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.476
No shit.
When's it gonna be?

28:15.519 --> 28:17.434
It wasn't for you to read.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.262
You stole it.
Stole it?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.134
Yes, your assistant.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.919
You need to trust me
when I say that I needed it.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.617
This is not to be read
until it is done.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.402
I say when it is done.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.318
Fair enough.

28:33.146 --> 28:34.843
Anybody in this
building read it?

28:34.887 --> 28:37.150
No.Uh-huh.

28:37.193 --> 28:38.847
What about Evans?
Did he read it?

28:38.891 --> 28:42.024
Nobody's read it except
for me and Bettye.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.071
Good.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.856
Have a cannoli.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.337
Where are they from?
Veniero's on 11th.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.382
Okay.

28:55.429 --> 28:56.691
So you really liked it?

28:56.735 --> 28:58.824
I loved it.

28:58.867 --> 29:01.391
Now, look, I'm not trying
to put any undue pressure

29:01.435 --> 29:02.610
on you and Mario, but

29:02.653 --> 29:03.916
I really need
that script finished

29:03.959 --> 29:05.221
so that we can start the budget

29:05.265 --> 29:06.788
and see if New York's
a possibility or not.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.224
Well, we gotta shoot here.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.705
I know, I finagled this young
guy in the film office.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.229
He's gonna help us
with some incentives.

29:13.273 --> 29:16.015
And I got a few locations
we need to check out.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.887
Like, now.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.671
Like, now now?
Yeah.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.593
Okay, so this is
the last house of the day.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.421
Now, it's bigger
than we talked about

29:31.465 --> 29:32.858
and needs a little bit of work,

29:32.901 --> 29:36.165
but I figured, might as well
take a look at it.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.951
At least it's quiet
in Staten Island, huh?

29:38.994 --> 29:40.822
We'll get a lot more
bang for our buck out here.

29:40.866 --> 29:42.128
Mm-hmm.Mm.

29:42.171 --> 29:45.131
Ah, welcome.
Mr. Lovano.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.002
This is Al Ruddy,
the producer of the film.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.656
Nice to meet you.
Thanks for having us.

29:48.699 --> 29:49.831
Oh, no problem.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.226
Come this way. Come this way.

29:53.269 --> 29:54.618
Huh.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.012
You have a beautiful home.
Thank you.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.449
It's a good neighborhood.
Quiet.

30:10.721 --> 30:13.159
I think he likes it.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.683
I don't know. I haven't
heard him take a picture yet.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.685
He's seeing it.

30:17.728 --> 30:20.557
He's looking at
how he's gonna shoot it.

30:24.692 --> 30:27.434
Huh.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.849
Al and Bettye, come here.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.329
Do me a favor.

30:58.073 --> 31:00.946
Okay, Bettye here.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.165
Ruddy there.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.428
Just look at each other.

31:05.472 --> 31:09.432
Just sit. Sit.
You're the lovebirds.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.087
Just be natural.

31:12.131 --> 31:15.134
Good. Michael and Kay.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.223
Yeah, come in.
Come in a little closer.

31:17.266 --> 31:18.746
How's that, boss?
Yes, sir.

31:18.789 --> 31:20.487
How's that?

31:20.530 --> 31:21.531
Good man.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.664
Love it. Paisan.
Si.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.057
We able to shoot
on the lawn here?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.972
Of course.
Anything you need.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.974
Grazie.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.282
This is perfect.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.197
We can shoot
the whole wedding sequence

31:35.241 --> 31:36.329
right on the lawn here.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.983
And it's bright,
and it's alive.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.550
A celebration
juxtaposed against the darkness

31:40.594 --> 31:42.509
of what's happening
in the Don's office

31:42.552 --> 31:44.554
just beyond these walls.

31:44.598 --> 31:46.861
You like it.

31:46.905 --> 31:47.949
I like it.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.691
Let's lock it in.
You got it.

31:50.734 --> 31:51.866
Oh, yeah, before I forget,

31:51.910 --> 31:53.172
how many times
does the word "Mafia"

31:53.215 --> 31:54.782
appear in the script?

31:54.825 --> 31:57.393
Ooh.
I think just once?

31:57.437 --> 31:58.438
Uh, yeah.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.135
The producer, Woltz, he says it

32:00.179 --> 32:01.963
to Tom Hagen, consigliere.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.443
He says,
"Now, you listen to me,

32:03.486 --> 32:05.053
"you smooth-talking
son of a bitch.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.272
"I'm gonna lay it on the line

32:06.315 --> 32:08.013
"for you and your boss,
wherever he is.

32:08.056 --> 32:10.102
"Johnny Fontaine never makes it
into this movie.

32:10.145 --> 32:13.409
"I don't care how many
dago guinea wop Mafia goombahs

32:13.453 --> 32:14.889
come out of the woodwork."
It's a good line.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.935
Okay, cut it.
Just the word.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.285
Trust me. It's important.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.199
Done.

32:20.242 --> 32:21.156
Ooh, there's a nice old school

32:21.200 --> 32:22.766
Italian restaurant around here

32:22.810 --> 32:24.812
called Luigi's.
Want to come?

32:24.855 --> 32:26.770
I'd love to,
but I gotta meet a friend.

32:26.814 --> 32:27.989
Okay, suit yourself.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.991
He's 14.

32:30.035 --> 32:32.646
Remember how that felt?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.343
I can't get that kid
out of the bathroom.

32:34.387 --> 32:36.302
He thinks I don't know
what he's doing in there.

32:38.217 --> 32:40.393
You got any kids?
No.

32:40.436 --> 32:42.482
Sometimes I feel like
this movie's my kid.

32:42.525 --> 32:44.005
Yeah, well, listen,

32:44.049 --> 32:45.659
everyone here now
sees you with me,

32:45.702 --> 32:46.965
so your kid's a go.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.140
Sir.
Thank you, buddy. Thank you.

32:48.183 --> 32:49.706
Have a seat.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.493
See Cher?
Cher, right there. Look.

32:53.536 --> 32:54.624
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

32:54.668 --> 32:56.235
Married to that
little lawn jockey.

32:56.278 --> 32:58.280
What the fuck is she doing
with that guy?

32:58.324 --> 33:00.804
Making millions of dollars.

33:00.848 --> 33:02.676
I chose the wrong racket.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.721
Me too.

33:10.597 --> 33:11.728
Hey, Joe.
What?

33:11.772 --> 33:12.729
You know that guy?

33:16.951 --> 33:19.084
Who?
The congressman, Biaggi?

33:19.127 --> 33:21.042
Yeah.
I met with him.

33:21.086 --> 33:22.565
He's a dick.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.393
You don't gotta worry
about that guy.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.656
Like I told you,
you're with me now.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.223
My friends are your friends,

33:28.267 --> 33:31.270
and your enemies
are my enemies.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.880
The more I do this job,
the more I learn

33:32.923 --> 33:34.708
how many enemies
I might actually have.

33:34.751 --> 33:35.752
Yeah.

33:35.796 --> 33:38.233
Welcome to the club.

33:38.277 --> 33:42.237
The important thing is you
make sure you see 'em coming.

33:42.281 --> 33:45.327
Where are yours coming from,
Al?

33:45.371 --> 33:49.027
Every day's a surprise.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.812
I don't know.
I guess I, uh...

33:51.855 --> 33:54.075
I do things my own way,
and that makes 'em nervous.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.121
I just don't have time
for the corporate bullshit

33:56.164 --> 33:57.470
or their fuckin' rules.

33:57.513 --> 34:00.125
I see a job in front of me,
and I do it.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.301
It's the only way I know how.
Whoa!

34:02.344 --> 34:04.651
Do I understand that,
my friend.

34:04.694 --> 34:07.480
Listen, listen, the old guard
ain't ready for the new.

34:07.523 --> 34:09.221
They got their own way
of doing things,

34:09.264 --> 34:11.136
and they don't like men
with a different vision.

34:11.179 --> 34:13.442
It's like with the League.
That's my baby.

34:13.486 --> 34:15.531
I gotta spend half my time
explaining things

34:15.575 --> 34:17.577
rather than
just making it happen.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.274
Tony!

34:19.318 --> 34:21.450
Get my friend here
whatever he wants.

34:21.494 --> 34:23.322
I'll have a club soda.
Club soda?

34:23.365 --> 34:25.759
Al, this is the Copa.
Have a drink.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.630
I'd love to, but I can't.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
I got a early flight
back to LA to make sure

34:29.502 --> 34:31.373
the writers do
what you and I discussed.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.940
That's what I like to hear.

34:32.983 --> 34:34.898
Scotch for my friend Mr. Ruddy.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.596
Yes, sir.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.904
You know, Joe,

34:40.948 --> 34:42.776
you've been so good to me.

34:42.819 --> 34:45.692
I just hope when you come to LA
I can return the favor.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.737
Yeah, well, that
ain't never gonna happen,

34:47.781 --> 34:49.174
but thank you, Al.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.306
You don't like LA?
No, fuck LA.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.612
You people are one good shake

34:52.655 --> 34:54.396
from that whole state
falling in the ocean.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.709
Evans, where
the fuck have you been?

35:02.752 --> 35:04.972
I'm so sorry that missed
your calls, Charlie.

35:05.015 --> 35:06.365
I have been deeply involved

35:06.408 --> 35:08.323
with nourishing our babies.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.543
Yeah, if I wanted babies,
I'd fuck a supermodel.

35:14.329 --> 35:16.288
Are you firing me, Charlie?

35:16.331 --> 35:18.638
Huh?
Why would I do that?

35:18.681 --> 35:20.074
I saw the headlines
in "Variety,"

35:20.118 --> 35:21.293
and let me tell you--
Stop being paranoid, Evans.

35:21.336 --> 35:22.685
I'm not firing you.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.774
As long as I own this place,
you're fine.

35:24.818 --> 35:27.690
That's why I've been trying
to call you.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.257
We got bigger problems.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.172
Paramount's in trouble,
and the board isn't happy.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.609
"Love Story" is gonna be
box office gold,

35:33.653 --> 35:35.698
and we got "The Godfather"
on the runway, right behind it.

35:35.742 --> 35:38.614
If they don't perform,
I'll fall in my sword.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.268
You're asking for time,
Evans,

35:40.312 --> 35:42.444
and money has no patience.

35:42.488 --> 35:44.185
The only thing
this board cares about

35:44.229 --> 35:45.621
is quarterly reports.

35:45.665 --> 35:49.625
I'm telling you, these films
are gonna deliver 100%.

35:51.192 --> 35:52.280
Charlie?

35:55.588 --> 35:57.720
He's an outsider
in his own family.

35:57.764 --> 36:01.071
I think Michael wants more
for himself, don't you?

36:01.115 --> 36:04.205
Ah. He's torn.

36:04.249 --> 36:05.337
He says he doesn't
want to be involved

36:05.380 --> 36:07.121
in the family business...
Mm-hmm.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.297
But, uh,

36:09.341 --> 36:14.520
I think there's a piece of him
that actually does.

36:14.563 --> 36:15.956
Mm.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.872
And what is that?
Is that power?

36:18.915 --> 36:21.962
Well, uh, the lure of power

36:22.005 --> 36:24.573
can certainly be
a strong aphrodisiac,

36:24.617 --> 36:27.185
but, uh, I think
it's more than that.

36:27.228 --> 36:29.535
He's brave because

36:29.578 --> 36:32.407
he's separating
from his family, right?

36:32.451 --> 36:33.887
But, uh,

36:33.930 --> 36:36.629
they're still the most
important thing to him.

36:36.672 --> 36:39.066
And where do you think
Kay fits in?

36:39.109 --> 36:41.721
Well,
Michael loves Kay,

36:41.764 --> 36:44.202
but part of that
is probably his rebellion

36:44.245 --> 36:46.291
against what
his family's doing, you know?

36:46.334 --> 36:48.771
Kay isn't even Italian,

36:48.815 --> 36:50.817
so she helps prove
he's his own man.

36:54.603 --> 36:56.170
Good.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.911
That's great, Al.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.260
Put him on film.

36:59.304 --> 37:02.350
Put him on film!

37:02.394 --> 37:04.570
Okay, we're gonna do a couple--
couple scenes, okay?

37:04.613 --> 37:06.267
But then...
All right.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.312
You and I,
we're gonna talk again

37:07.355 --> 37:08.269
when I'm in New York,
all right?

37:08.313 --> 37:09.401
I'd like that.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.680
Welcome home, cherie.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.553
I don't think it's possible
for me to love you

37:31.597 --> 37:33.990
any more than I do right now.

37:34.034 --> 37:35.644
Nonsense.

37:35.688 --> 37:39.082
Wait till you try my chicken.

37:49.049 --> 37:50.355
What does that even mean?

37:50.398 --> 37:51.921
"When chickens
will have teeth."

37:54.141 --> 37:55.490
No, why are you laughing?

37:55.534 --> 37:58.624
It's a common French saying.

37:58.667 --> 38:01.888
You think "when pigs fly"
makes more sense?

38:01.931 --> 38:04.151
I don't know why I think
that is so funny.

38:04.194 --> 38:05.370
Well, I'm glad
you're in a good mood,

38:05.413 --> 38:09.025
because, um, I have
a proposition for you.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.505
A business proposition.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.028
Uh-oh.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.726
Should I call my lawyer?

38:13.769 --> 38:16.163
I'm kidding, baby.

38:16.206 --> 38:20.080
I'm kidding.
What is it?

38:20.123 --> 38:22.082
Oh, no.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.779
Do you know
who Sue Mengers is?

38:23.823 --> 38:25.172
Yeah, of course.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.479
She's tough.
She got good clients though.

38:27.522 --> 38:30.308
Well, she's interested in
a Nick Aubrey script

38:30.351 --> 38:33.441
that was submitted to you.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.313
How does she know about
the Nick Aubrey script?

38:35.356 --> 38:37.358
'Cause she saw me reading it.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.229
Devouring it, actually.

38:39.273 --> 38:41.406
What I mean is
how did you come to read

38:41.449 --> 38:42.885
the Nick Aubrey script?

38:42.929 --> 38:44.539
Well, the other day
I came to get your car,

38:44.583 --> 38:46.062
and I just saw it laying there.

38:46.106 --> 38:50.153
This has to be your next film.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.504
Babe, my life is consumed
right now with "The Godfather."

38:52.547 --> 38:53.766
I can't even think
about something--

38:53.809 --> 38:55.942
No, I know.
That's not what I'm suggesting.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.596
Let me finish, okay?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.774
I'm not a movie producer,
but I'm a businesswoman.

39:01.817 --> 39:04.298
And these scripts,
they come into your office

39:04.342 --> 39:06.431
and just sit there, that's--

39:06.474 --> 39:08.476
that's just money burning.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.305
And I know
you don't have the time,

39:11.349 --> 39:14.395
but I do, so let me help you.

39:14.439 --> 39:15.570
What about the Chateau?

39:15.614 --> 39:18.356
I can do more than one thing
at a time.

39:20.227 --> 39:22.577
Baby,
producing's a full-time gig.

39:22.621 --> 39:23.839
It's constant chaos.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.102
I was born into chaos.
It doesn't scare me.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.800
It's all I know.

39:32.544 --> 39:36.025
We can do this together.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.684
Okay.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.645
Okay?

39:46.688 --> 39:49.212
If that's what you want,
let's do it.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.434
Yes! Yes! Yes!

39:53.478 --> 39:56.394
Yes, my baby! Huh? Yes!

40:03.575 --> 40:05.446
Good morning.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.580
So--
Francoise, good morning.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.016
Good morning, Bettye.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.322
Since you have a meeting,

40:12.366 --> 40:14.324
I'm gonna use your office,
all right?

40:14.368 --> 40:15.804
Hm?
Okay.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.463
There he is.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.986
Tough man to find.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.640
You're lucky I wanted
to stretch my legs.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.033
I was just heading
to your office.

40:27.076 --> 40:29.557
With a script, I hope.
Francis and Puzo

40:29.601 --> 40:31.559
are putting
the finishing touches on it.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.866
Well, tell 'em to stop
touching it, would you?

40:33.909 --> 40:35.955
For Christ's sake, if we want
to get this thing cast

40:35.998 --> 40:37.304
with someone
who actually means something,

40:37.347 --> 40:38.566
I need a script
for people to read.

40:38.610 --> 40:40.046
I mean, the damn thing's called
"The Godfather."

40:40.089 --> 40:42.396
It's hard to get a Don
without a script.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.442
Hi, Bob.
Hey, gorgeous.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.008
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you were here.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.401
Yes.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.794
I think I found
a possible solution

40:48.837 --> 40:50.970
to your "Godfather" problem.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.145
Really?

40:52.188 --> 40:53.929
Well, who doesn't love
a good solution?

40:53.973 --> 40:55.104
Let's hear it.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.192
Sinatra.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.848
If you get him to play the Don,

40:59.892 --> 41:02.721
all your problems will go away.

41:02.764 --> 41:04.810
Yeah, that's
really interesting.

41:04.853 --> 41:06.638
Yeah.
Maybe I should fire Ruddy

41:06.681 --> 41:07.987
and give you
this office instead.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.644
Do you mind if I borrow him
for a while?

41:12.687 --> 41:14.776
Sure.
Have fun, boys.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.084
Let's walk and walk, Ruddy.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.656
And I sent over a copy
of the New York shooting plan.

41:24.699 --> 41:25.831
I got a deal
with the film office

41:25.874 --> 41:26.962
that's really gonna
help us out.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.529
Yeah, I got it.
And it looks great.

41:28.573 --> 41:29.878
But I can't greenlight

41:29.922 --> 41:32.446
until I got a budget and--
what do you call 'em?

41:32.490 --> 41:34.100
Uh, made of paper,
roughly 120 pages long.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.928
A script.
Ah, you've heard of them.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.495
Halle-fucking-lujah.
Look, look.

41:37.538 --> 41:40.498
I'm gonna get it to you,
all right? I promise.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.325
I'm not done, Ruddy.
I'm not done.

41:43.892 --> 41:47.243
Frank Sinatra for the Don?

41:47.287 --> 41:49.898
Don't ever, fucking ever,

41:49.942 --> 41:52.161
let your girl pitch a stupid
idea like that to me again,

41:52.205 --> 41:53.728
or I swear to God,

41:53.772 --> 41:55.774
I will find me a producer

41:55.817 --> 42:00.561
who knows not to shit
where he sleeps.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.824
Now you can fuck off.

42:13.661 --> 42:14.967
So?

42:15.010 --> 42:17.926
Did Evans like my idea
about Sinatra?

42:17.970 --> 42:19.449
Jesus Christ.
He--

42:19.493 --> 42:21.495
There he is.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.018
Security made me park
in Canada.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.325
I'm going to need a taxi
back to my car later.

42:25.368 --> 42:26.979
I'll take care of it.
Hello.

42:27.022 --> 42:28.197
Hello.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.547
Francis, Francoise.

42:29.590 --> 42:31.940
Actress?
No.

42:31.984 --> 42:33.333
Okay.

42:33.376 --> 42:34.508
Is the baby here yet?

42:34.552 --> 42:35.814
Baby.

42:35.857 --> 42:37.946
I feel like
I've given birth.

42:37.990 --> 42:39.469
Here we go.

42:39.513 --> 42:41.776
Looks like twins.
Do me a favor.

42:41.820 --> 42:43.952
Hold the commentary
until you've carefully read

42:43.996 --> 42:46.476
what we worked
so very hard at creating.

42:46.520 --> 42:47.434
Let me dig in.

42:47.477 --> 42:50.393
Ah! You have casting.

42:50.437 --> 42:52.831
So I will make copies.

42:52.874 --> 42:55.573
Ruddy, your eyes only.

42:55.616 --> 42:57.400
I know.Okay.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.794
Francoise.
Bye, Francis.

43:02.710 --> 43:05.626
Hey, the whole gang's
here. Good.

43:05.670 --> 43:08.455
Andrea. What have we got?

43:08.498 --> 43:09.630
We've got one specific choice

43:09.674 --> 43:11.545
we wanted to
show you for Michael.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.766
All right. Good.

43:22.774 --> 43:24.689
He's torn.

43:24.732 --> 43:26.168
He says
he doesn't want to be involved

43:26.212 --> 43:27.822
in the family business.
Stop. Stop. Stop!

43:27.866 --> 43:29.824
Bob, just watch him.
Pacino's really good.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.913
Cut it!
Read my lips.

43:31.957 --> 43:34.350
That shrimp
never gets the part.

43:34.394 --> 43:36.744
It's just started.
He's a beautiful actor!

43:36.788 --> 43:38.485
Hey, director,
take a visual cue.

43:38.528 --> 43:40.008
Doesn't get this part.

43:40.052 --> 43:42.445
Give me
some movie star choices.

43:42.489 --> 43:45.013
Redford. O'Neal. Jimmy Caan.

43:45.057 --> 43:48.582
Anybody here besides me realize
this picture needs to be a hit?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.802
Oh, oh, oh, before I forget.

43:50.845 --> 43:52.760
Ruddy, maybe you can
explain to me

43:52.804 --> 43:56.677
how Al Pacino has pages
and I fucking don't!

44:04.293 --> 44:06.818
Jimmy Caan
could be interesting.

44:06.861 --> 44:09.516
Okey dokey.

44:17.350 --> 44:19.569
We tried.
I'm sorry.

44:19.613 --> 44:22.964
Why am I even here?

44:23.008 --> 44:24.749
If they--
if they won't let me do

44:24.792 --> 44:26.620
what they hired me to do,

44:26.664 --> 44:29.188
why am I even here?

44:45.770 --> 44:49.121
So how is it?

44:52.341 --> 44:55.040
Al?

44:55.083 --> 44:57.520
Sorry, baby,
did you say something?

44:57.564 --> 44:59.740
The script, is it good?

45:01.176 --> 45:02.874
It's incredible.

45:02.917 --> 45:05.659
Can I read it?

45:05.703 --> 45:07.356
When I'm done.

45:09.750 --> 45:12.840
Next time,
bring home extra copies.

45:17.410 --> 45:19.325
I'll be up in a bit.

45:39.998 --> 45:42.261
Bob. What's going on?

45:42.304 --> 45:45.133
170 pages?

45:45.177 --> 45:48.180
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

45:48.223 --> 45:49.877
How did you get that?
Oh, please, shut up.

45:49.921 --> 45:51.139
I know just about
every page that goes

45:51.183 --> 45:52.793
through that copy room.
Did you read it?

45:52.837 --> 45:56.188
Because I did, and it's great.
I don't have to at 170 pages.

45:56.231 --> 45:58.668
I told you Puzo
was a bad idea.

45:58.712 --> 46:00.975
That dogshit
is unproduceable.

46:01.019 --> 46:02.194
Bob, come in.
We'll have a drink.

46:02.237 --> 46:03.325
Talk about it.
Oh, fuck you.

46:03.369 --> 46:04.936
Fuck yourself, Al.

46:04.979 --> 46:06.024
Hey, you know
what I'm thinking?

46:06.067 --> 46:07.416
Here's what I'm thinking.

46:07.460 --> 46:09.070
You should just go back
to doing some sitcoms.

46:09.114 --> 46:10.376
That's what I'm thinking.

46:10.419 --> 46:11.333
Have a great night, asshole.

46:14.293 --> 46:15.207
You too.

46:34.139 --> 46:38.143
Fuckin' "Crazy Joe" Gallo.

46:38.186 --> 46:40.449
When the fuck did you get out?

46:40.493 --> 46:42.625
Yo, relax.

46:42.669 --> 46:44.540
He's a friend.

46:47.979 --> 46:49.763
Paroled today.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.504
Wanted to pay my respects.

46:51.547 --> 46:54.115
Well, well, well,
you bypassed your guinea prince

46:54.159 --> 46:56.814
to come up to Harlem, huh?

46:56.857 --> 46:58.728
Guess you really are as crazy
on the outside

46:58.772 --> 47:00.556
as you were on the inside.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.732
You did right by me.

47:02.776 --> 47:04.212
I don't forget that.

47:04.256 --> 47:05.387
Gallo's an animal.

47:05.431 --> 47:08.216
He kidnapped members
of his own family.

47:08.260 --> 47:10.566
It's unforgivable what he did.
He did his time.

47:10.610 --> 47:14.875
That crazy motherfucker
had a lion in his apartment.

47:14.919 --> 47:17.225
He had a what?
A lion.

47:17.269 --> 47:19.837
From the jungle.
In his apartment.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.927
It's true.

47:22.970 --> 47:25.364
If I may, Carlo,

47:25.407 --> 47:28.062
I have a proposition.

47:28.106 --> 47:30.891
I propose that my family
take control of Joe Gallo.

47:30.935 --> 47:32.371
We'll keep him in line,

47:32.414 --> 47:35.765
make sure that he acts
with respect.

47:35.809 --> 47:37.332
Are you saying, Paul,

47:37.376 --> 47:40.596
you guarantee
Gallo will behave himself?

47:40.640 --> 47:41.641
I am.

47:41.684 --> 47:44.513
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

47:44.557 --> 47:48.648
Joe Gallo is a Profaci.

47:48.691 --> 47:51.912
This is my family.

47:51.956 --> 47:54.393
And while his actions
led to our last war,

47:54.436 --> 47:56.482
I was not the head
of the Profaci family,

47:56.525 --> 47:58.919
and I cannot speak
for my family's leadership

47:58.963 --> 48:00.660
during that terrible time.

48:00.703 --> 48:02.314
My family,

48:02.357 --> 48:04.098
as this Commission
has authorized,

48:04.142 --> 48:06.318
is now the Colombo family,

48:06.361 --> 48:08.494
and I have a right to handle
these matters as I see fit.

48:08.537 --> 48:11.018
Joe.

48:11.062 --> 48:13.891
We appreciate
what you're saying here.

48:13.934 --> 48:16.197
But if Gallo comes out,
guns blazing,

48:16.241 --> 48:17.851
as is his nature--
Carlo, Carlo.

48:17.895 --> 48:19.244
I'll handle it.
You have my word.

48:19.287 --> 48:20.854
Joe Gallo will not
be a problem.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.508
I just think it's best
if he's put with

48:22.551 --> 48:24.031
a different family.
That's what I'm saying.

48:24.075 --> 48:27.208
I think that would be
a bad precedent.

48:27.252 --> 48:28.557
Are you proposing
that every time

48:28.601 --> 48:29.950
there's an internal problem,

48:29.994 --> 48:31.212
the Commission needs to meet
and trade soldiers

48:31.256 --> 48:33.214
like we're some
goddamn baseball team?

48:33.258 --> 48:35.216
I'm with Joe on this.

48:35.260 --> 48:37.436
This is an internal
Colombo matter.

48:37.479 --> 48:38.698
Thank you, Tommy.

48:42.223 --> 48:44.095
Fine.

48:44.138 --> 48:46.575
Gallo remains a Colombo.

48:46.619 --> 48:47.576
Thank you.

48:47.620 --> 48:49.143
But, Joe...

48:50.797 --> 48:52.146
Don't make us regret it, huh?

48:52.190 --> 48:53.582
No.

48:53.626 --> 48:54.932
Thank you.
Thank you, Carlo.

48:54.975 --> 48:57.282
Now, turning to the airports.

48:57.325 --> 48:59.675
JFK is covered.
LaGuardia?

49:03.114 --> 49:04.767
It's beautiful.

49:04.811 --> 49:05.899
Take away the crime,

49:05.943 --> 49:06.987
this could be
any American family.

49:07.031 --> 49:08.597
You did it.

49:08.641 --> 49:10.860
Now, we are gonna have to make
some cuts for budget,

49:10.904 --> 49:12.340
but really, really good stuff.

49:12.384 --> 49:14.952
And that's the sound
of the other shoe dropping.

49:14.995 --> 49:16.344
Francis, Sicily.

49:16.388 --> 49:17.476
Do we really need
that whole section?

49:17.519 --> 49:18.651
Yes.

49:18.694 --> 49:20.566
It's so important
to Michael's story.

49:20.609 --> 49:22.481
We have to see the catalyst

49:22.524 --> 49:24.918
for his transformation
into darkness.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.398
All right.
We'll talk through it at lunch.

49:26.441 --> 49:28.835
I'm buying.

49:28.878 --> 49:30.532
There he is.

49:32.186 --> 49:34.493
Mario, get in here.

49:34.536 --> 49:38.105
I was just telling Francis
how good the script is.

49:38.932 --> 49:40.716
Are you having a stroke?

49:40.760 --> 49:41.891
I'm happy.

49:41.935 --> 49:43.719
Do you want to know
why I'm happy?

49:43.763 --> 49:45.591
Yes.

49:45.634 --> 49:47.027
Brando wrote you back.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.333
He wants to do it.
Are you kidding me?

49:48.376 --> 49:51.510
He wants to play the Don!
Oh, my God.

49:51.553 --> 49:53.207
I guess this calls for drinks
at lunch.

49:53.251 --> 49:55.035
"Dear Mario.
I read your book.

49:55.079 --> 49:56.906
I especially identify with--"
So proud of you.

49:56.950 --> 49:59.605
Brando!
What? Yes!

49:59.648 --> 50:01.128
Oh, my God.

50:01.172 --> 50:02.825
Wow!

50:02.869 --> 50:04.305
Brando.
Hey.

50:04.349 --> 50:05.698
Hi.

50:05.741 --> 50:07.482
Al.
Sue.

50:07.526 --> 50:08.614
Shall we?
Sure.

50:16.839 --> 50:18.319
Are you okay with that?

50:18.363 --> 50:20.365
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, it's fine.

50:20.408 --> 50:22.584
I think we both know
it's not.

50:22.628 --> 50:24.325
You gotta talk to her.

50:24.369 --> 50:25.718
What the hell
am I supposed to say?

50:25.761 --> 50:27.067
I don't know.

50:27.111 --> 50:29.330
I just know you shouldn't
shit where you eat.

50:31.854 --> 50:34.640
I really wish people would
stop telling me where to shit.

50:34.683 --> 50:36.033
Right.

50:43.170 --> 50:44.911
Is Jimmy out yet?

50:44.954 --> 50:47.827
Shivved a guy
a day before his parole.

50:47.870 --> 50:50.221
He ain't going nowhere.

50:50.264 --> 50:52.527
And Leonard?
He still in New York?

50:52.571 --> 50:54.529
Dead.

50:55.835 --> 50:57.706
Fuck.

50:57.750 --> 50:58.838
Who did it?

50:58.881 --> 51:01.275
Nobody.

51:01.319 --> 51:03.321
First night out, he got lit,

51:03.364 --> 51:05.671
passed out
on the subway platform,

51:05.714 --> 51:07.281
fell in,

51:07.325 --> 51:10.719
got decapitated by the D train.

51:16.812 --> 51:19.511
Oh, man.

51:19.554 --> 51:21.730
That shit just ain't right.
Man.

51:36.136 --> 51:40.401
What do you got in mind
for him?

51:40.445 --> 51:44.884
I'm gonna light his whole
fucking world on fire.

51:46.015 --> 51:47.365
And burn
everything he ever loved

51:47.408 --> 51:50.542
to the fucking ground.

53:11.275 --> 53:13.407
I got a script
the size of an encyclopedia.

53:13.451 --> 53:14.843
A director in love
with the shortest

53:14.887 --> 53:15.975
unknown actor on the planet.

53:16.018 --> 53:17.498
And I walked into an ambush.

53:17.542 --> 53:19.370
FBI!
Am I forgetting anything?

53:19.761 --> 53:20.762
No.

53:21.589 --> 53:23.200
This picture...
Action!

53:23.678 --> 53:26.115
...is an assault
on Italian-Americans everywhere.

53:26.594 --> 53:28.640
We lost
the Staten Island compound.

53:28.683 --> 53:30.859
Use another house,
is that what you just said?

53:31.208 --> 53:32.731
So this is
a gangster film?

53:32.774 --> 53:33.514
It's more than that.

53:33.993 --> 53:35.864
We know people
want romance...

53:35.908 --> 53:37.039
To The Godfather!

53:37.083 --> 53:38.693
...and violence.

53:39.259 --> 53:40.304
Find me a better one.

53:40.347 --> 53:42.306
I'm in charge
of the horse head? Fuck!

53:43.698 --> 53:44.525
Gallo's gone underground.

53:45.047 --> 53:46.832
Don't underestimate
that crazy bastard.

53:46.875 --> 53:48.834
The Godfather
is becoming a problem.

53:48.877 --> 53:50.009
I'm not cutting the scene!

53:50.052 --> 53:51.097
We need to get rid
of Coppola.

53:51.358 --> 53:52.664
You better be ready
to take over.

53:52.707 --> 53:54.274
Let me know
what our options are.

53:54.579 --> 53:55.667
You're selling Paramount?

53:57.234 --> 53:59.540
You never let them know
what we're thinking.

54:00.454 --> 54:01.499
I took a chance on you

54:02.108 --> 54:03.457
and you stabbed me
in the back.
What have I lied about?

54:03.501 --> 54:04.893
You lied about everything.

54:04.937 --> 54:06.286
Did you ever stop
and think about

54:06.852 --> 54:08.245
the repercussions,
about what that meant
for the rest of us?

54:08.288 --> 54:09.420
I'm doing this on my own.

54:09.985 --> 54:12.031
When you fail alone,
there's no one else to blame.

54:12.684 --> 54:14.294
That's the only way I want it.

54:23.303 --> 54:24.391
Action!

54:25.479 --> 54:26.872
Sit the fuck down.

54:37.230 --> 54:38.753
Do you know who I am?

54:39.319 --> 54:41.495
With all due respect, I got--
I'm Joe Colombo.

54:42.496 --> 54:44.106
I kinda run things around here.

54:44.150 --> 54:45.499
Both Miles and Giovanni

54:45.543 --> 54:48.285
brought incredible
weight to that scene.

54:48.328 --> 54:50.548
I love Miles Teller.

54:50.591 --> 54:54.421
It's like working with
a leading man out of the 1950s,

54:54.726 --> 54:55.553
which for me

54:56.249 --> 54:58.033
is probably the highest praise
I could give anybody.

55:02.864 --> 55:05.345
This was the moment
in the series

55:05.389 --> 55:08.348
where they first really
encounter one another,

55:08.392 --> 55:10.655
and they were
very invested in it.

55:10.698 --> 55:12.787
When you have somebody
to parlay off of,

55:12.831 --> 55:15.486
and you can see that they're
responding to certain things,

55:15.529 --> 55:17.357
and they're making you respond,

55:17.401 --> 55:19.577
this is what you strive for
as an actor.

55:19.620 --> 55:22.493
Stop what you're doing,
go back to Hollywood,

55:22.536 --> 55:24.277
and make a fucking cowboy movie.

55:24.538 --> 55:28.412
It was one of the more daunting
roles for me, personally,

55:28.455 --> 55:29.543
in my career.

55:29.804 --> 55:33.286
Joe Colombo just existed
in a different universe.

55:33.634 --> 55:37.812
He brought a combination
of both humor

55:37.856 --> 55:43.252
and bone-chilling fear into
his portrayal of Joe Colombo.

55:43.296 --> 55:44.776
You and me got a problem.

55:45.951 --> 55:46.778
If it's about my movie--

55:47.300 --> 55:48.388
I think it's best
if you hear me out first.

55:48.432 --> 55:49.650
It's one
of the relationships

55:49.694 --> 55:52.523
that I think travels
the furthest distance

55:52.566 --> 55:54.568
over the course of the show
because they start out

55:54.612 --> 55:58.093
in a threatening,
adversarial posture
with each other.

55:58.529 --> 56:00.182
The book is not the movie
I'm gonna make.

56:01.009 --> 56:02.097
And I can promise you

56:02.141 --> 56:03.838
that my movie is not gonna be
the book.

56:06.363 --> 56:07.668
What the fuck does that mean?

56:07.712 --> 56:12.281
It was incredible to
watch Miles bring the fear

56:12.325 --> 56:15.589
to what this character was
experiencing at that time.

56:15.850 --> 56:18.331
He wanted to really tap into

56:18.375 --> 56:19.985
the nail biting aspect of that,

56:20.028 --> 56:21.943
and I think he did a great job
of it.

56:22.248 --> 56:23.249
Cut!

56:23.292 --> 56:24.250
Nailed it.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.342
We'll go to
one of the showrunners,

56:29.603 --> 56:31.213
and we'll just be like,
"Did this actually...?"

56:31.257 --> 56:32.389
They're like, "Absolutely,"

56:32.432 --> 56:34.521
and all these things
actually happened.

56:34.565 --> 56:39.047
I said, "Joe, I am willing
to let you read the screenplay

56:39.091 --> 56:41.049
which nobody has seen.

56:41.485 --> 56:42.921
Come to my office

56:42.964 --> 56:45.880
and I will show you that
I'm telling you the truth."

56:46.620 --> 56:48.535
He said, "I'll be there tomorrow
at00."

56:48.579 --> 56:51.408
When Ruddy invites Joe
to read the script,

56:51.712 --> 56:54.236
you know what I mean,
that's insane to me.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.586
What happens if one of the suits

56:55.629 --> 56:57.109
sees your new gangster friend?

56:58.110 --> 57:00.242
Mr. Colombo, thanks
for stopping by.

57:00.286 --> 57:01.461
Call me Joe.
Joe.

57:01.505 --> 57:02.723
Yeah
Let's head to my office.

57:02.767 --> 57:03.507
Okay.

57:04.072 --> 57:05.160
Colombo did come up
to his office,

57:05.465 --> 57:06.684
Colombo picked up the script,

57:06.727 --> 57:09.469
and first thing he said,
"What's this fade-in?"

57:09.861 --> 57:10.905
The fade-in.

57:11.340 --> 57:12.690
What's that mean?

57:13.212 --> 57:15.127
Joe, fade-in's a script term.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.520
Ruddy explained it.

57:16.563 --> 57:17.651
That's Hollywood bullshit.

57:18.043 --> 57:20.437
And then Colombo sort of
thumbed through the script

57:20.480 --> 57:23.396
and decided that Ruddy
was a stand up guy.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.745
I ain't here to waste your time.

57:25.093 --> 57:27.400
You're a straight shooter
showing this to me,

57:27.444 --> 57:28.793
and I appreciate that.

57:29.663 --> 57:30.838
But we still got a problem.

57:31.186 --> 57:34.451
Finally, I said,
"Joe, what do you want?"

57:34.755 --> 57:37.018
And he said, "I'll tell
you exactly what I want.

57:37.062 --> 57:41.240
I want you to take the word
'mafia' out of the movie."

57:41.719 --> 57:42.807
You have my word.

57:44.983 --> 57:45.853
Congratulations.

57:46.332 --> 57:49.422
I said, "Shake my hand, Joe,
and we have a deal."

57:49.683 --> 57:53.034
There was a real creed with
the mafia and those guys

57:53.078 --> 57:56.168
that you don't go back
on your word, you know?

57:56.211 --> 57:58.605
And I think Al was very...

57:58.649 --> 58:01.390
Um, if he said something,
he meant it, you know?

58:01.913 --> 58:04.263
And I think that went
a long way with them.

58:04.611 --> 58:06.004
I like this guy.

58:06.047 --> 58:07.092
Come on, let's go.

58:07.135 --> 58:07.919
I'll call ya.

58:08.702 --> 58:11.096
Their methodology may
have been very different,

58:11.139 --> 58:14.447
but their intensity
and their resolve was...

58:14.708 --> 58:16.275
You know, they were
sort of brothers in arms

58:16.318 --> 58:17.363
in that respect.

58:17.406 --> 58:19.713
I see a job in front of me
and I do it.

58:19.757 --> 58:20.932
It's the only way I know how.

58:20.975 --> 58:24.022
Whoa, do I understand that,
my friend.
