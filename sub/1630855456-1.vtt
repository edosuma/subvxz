WEBVTT

00:15.891 --> 00:19.645
Wow. This is fancy.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.397
Okay.
I let my sister know we're here. Yeah.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.234
I can't believe
she's finally getting married.

00:25.234 --> 00:29.196
And to the guy who owns all of this.
Oh, my God.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.865
I know, right? Good job, Grace.

00:31.865 --> 00:35.410
Totally. I mean, they haven't even
known each other that long,

00:35.410 --> 00:38.539
but I'm happy for her. I really am.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.041
- There they are. Hi!
- Wow.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.378
Your mom and dad are already here.
I wasn't expecting to see them until--

00:44.378 --> 00:47.714
Hey. I love you,
and my parents are gonna love you.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.967
I just wanna make
a really good first impression.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.219
You will. And you know what?

00:52.219 --> 00:56.682
Maggie's with Brett the whole weekend, so
all we have to do is relax and have fun.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.309
Yes. Am I sweating?
I feel like I'm sweating a lot.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.855
Hey. Relaxing and fun.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.438
Relaxing and fun.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.246
Yeah!

02:34.571 --> 02:38.283
Hey, I don't understand it.
Did you just find him like this?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.743
Were you up all night?

02:39.743 --> 02:43.956
What? No. He was passed out drunk
the minute I got into the room,

02:43.956 --> 02:46.083
so I just slept beside him.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.545
Oh, my God. I slept beside him.
Oh, my God.

02:52.589 --> 02:56.927
My poor boy. He died in his sleep,
just like his father.

02:56.927 --> 03:03.392
As the Hopi say, "Do not fear tears,
for they are grief's mirrors."

03:04.393 --> 03:06.937
Sounds better in Hopi. It does not rhyme.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.149
This is not good.
This is bad. This is very bad.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.777
This is very bad.

03:13.777 --> 03:17.739
God, such good hair.
You'll never lose it now.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.492
I wouldn't pet the dead body.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.077
Why?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.163
Hey, can I talk to you in the corner
real quick? No big deal.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.958
- Yeah, we might wanna have a little--
- Not you.

03:29.501 --> 03:35.007
- I think Edgar was murdered.
- What?

03:35.007 --> 03:39.303
- You can't just say someone is murdered.
- Look at this.

03:40.929 --> 03:43.348
- It's dead.
- Oh, my God.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.766
I know, right?

03:44.766 --> 03:45.851
Edgar randomly--

03:45.851 --> 03:49.104
I mean, tragically, but also randomly dies

03:49.104 --> 03:51.940
and his pet lizard
also happens to die too?

03:51.940 --> 03:52.858
I don't think so.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.736
Remember how all weekend he was
sharing his food and drinks with it?

03:55.736 --> 03:58.197
I think someone poisoned Edgar,

03:58.197 --> 04:00.657
and his lizard inadvertently
got poisoned also.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.536
Holy shit. Another murder.

04:04.536 --> 04:08.832
You're right. My son was poisoned.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.586
- What?
- Along with his beloved lizard, Roxana.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.214
And Grace killed them both.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.341
What?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.052
- No.
- Take it back.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.220
- How dare you?
- I didn't--

04:21.220 --> 04:25.098
- That's exactly what you said, Aniq.
- What? No, I didn't say that.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.853
Grace only met my sweet boy
six months ago.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.940
Obviously, she married him for his money

04:33.982 --> 04:36.401
and then poisoned him
on their wedding night.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.903
- You are out of line.
- No, I didn't.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.155
- I didn't, Zozo. Please.
- I know.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.200
So, this is what's going to happen.
I'm going to call my dear friend,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.285
Sheriff Reardon, Howie,

04:45.285 --> 04:47.412
who is a capable, handsome man,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.706
and he will know exactly what to do.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.251
Isabel.

04:52.251 --> 04:53.919
No, please. I will go to jail.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.546
I don't think that's a good idea.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.130
What's happening?

04:58.006 --> 05:01.426
I'm not sure, but historically,
when rich, white people whisper,

05:01.426 --> 05:02.928
it's never a good thing.

05:05.389 --> 05:10.310
On second thought,
while this is an unspeakable tragedy,

05:10.310 --> 05:14.857
it's not going to become
more speakable over the next few hours,

05:14.857 --> 05:18.610
so we will have to handle
some important business considerations

05:18.610 --> 05:20.571
before notifying the authorities.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.157
No one is to leave the grounds
until that happens.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.828
- I don't think I'd thrive in jail.
- I'll take care of it.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.414
- Hey.
- I didn't do it, Zozo. I didn't do it.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.917
No, I know. We will figure this out.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.878
How? Isabel's friends with the sheriff.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.754
She hates me. She's always hated me.

05:37.754 --> 05:42.968
Look, we have a few hours
before the sheriff gets here, so we can--

05:45.387 --> 05:46.763
I don't know.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.848
Hey...

05:52.019 --> 05:54.313
I might have a way to help, actually.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.440
Here's the book cover mock-up.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.902
We're all very excited.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.403
No, I'm excited too.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.989
I quit the force
before my pension came in,

06:03.989 --> 06:06.992
so I really need this to work.

06:06.992 --> 06:12.581
Totally. About that,
how is the actual writing coming?

06:12.581 --> 06:14.791
- It's going good.
- Good.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.628
You know, I was there, okay?
I know what happened.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.632
And as I'm writing, I'm just like, "What?"

06:21.632 --> 06:25.135
That is fantastic.
I'd love to see some pages.

06:26.762 --> 06:30.849
One second. Hold on. I gotta get this.
Eat my bacon. You're paying for it.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.685
Look who decided to call.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.271
Yeah, I've still got your card.

06:36.897 --> 06:40.442
<i>So what's up?
Has there been another murder?</i>

06:42.444 --> 06:44.571
- Actually--
- Stop. Seriously?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.657
<i>I don't know
exactly what I could do for you</i>

06:46.657 --> 06:48.325
because I quit the force.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.452
I'm an author now.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.580
Yeah. No, I know.
I saw your Instagram post.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.999
Lot of colorful language.
A lot of profanity there.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.418
Yeah, 'cause I'm a great fucking writer.

06:58.418 --> 07:02.798
Absolutely. But, see, you not being a cop
is actually a good thing,

07:02.798 --> 07:05.133
because we can't involve the police.

07:05.133 --> 07:09.555
See, okay. So, I'm at a wedding,
and the groom is dead.

07:09.555 --> 07:14.768
And the number one suspect is the bride,
who is Zoë's sister.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.020
Shit, that's bad.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.232
But you're still with Zoë though?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.402
Yeah. I just met her parents
for the first time this weekend.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.487
I was hoping to get their blessing,
'cause--

07:25.487 --> 07:27.865
OMG. Are you gonna propose?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.616
<i>Well, yeah, that was the idea.</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:32.119
But, I mean, this whole weekend's been
a total disaster.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.496
Just anything that could go wrong
has gone wrong.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.914
And also, the murder.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.250
<i>You know what? Hold on a second.</i>

07:38.834 --> 07:42.462
I am so sorry, but I have to go.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.425
<i>- There's been another murder.</i>
- Who are you talking to?

07:46.425 --> 07:48.260
Oh, my God. Another one?

07:49.094 --> 07:51.054
Maybe I'll write another book about it.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.598
But you haven't written this one.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.058
Okay, I'm on my way.

07:55.058 --> 07:58.145
Text me your location
and tell me everything.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.148
Thank you. So, the bride's name is Grace.

08:01.148 --> 08:05.027
And her husband, the groom, is Edgar--
well, was Edgar, 'cause he's--

08:05.027 --> 08:07.237
Wait, hold up. You know I have a process.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.364
I need to hear the whole story.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.659
So hit me with that Aniq rom-com sequel.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.369
This is not a sequel.

08:14.369 --> 08:17.331
You're at a wedding,
you're meeting the parents,

08:17.331 --> 08:19.333
and another murder happens.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.876
Sounds like a sequel to me.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
Whatever.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.341
- <i>We got in on Friday afternoon.</i>
- <i>Let me guess.</i>

08:27.341 --> 08:30.552
<i>Last time, your story started with you
driving up to the school all alone.</i>

08:30.552 --> 08:33.263
<i>This time,
you're driving up to the wedding,</i>

08:33.263 --> 08:35.265
<i>but Zoë's in the car with you.</i>

08:35.265 --> 08:37.558
- <i>Yeah. How did you--</i>
- <i>Sequel!</i>

08:41.145 --> 08:43.315
Welcome, fair travelers.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.318
Oh, my God. This place is amazing!

08:46.318 --> 08:47.861
Right? It's like Pemberley House.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.821
And the two of you have
your own separate cottage.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.532
It's good to see you again.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.911
Aniq, I so enjoyed our double date
to your escape room last time.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.120
As did Roxana.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.540
- Well, we should do it again sometime.
- Yeah.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.416
No, I don't think
I'd enjoy it a second time,

09:01.416 --> 09:03.794
because I'd already know all the answers.
It'd be tedious.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.172
Yeah. We could do something else.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.467
So, Zoë may have told you,
I primarily deal in antiquities,

09:10.467 --> 09:14.137
but I also do a little something
I like to call "unnecessary knitting"

09:14.137 --> 09:15.389
on the side.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.933
So, I made this for you.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.977
So sweet.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.564
What a lovely... Obama puppet?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.817
It's a tea cozy. It's supposed to be you.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.112
Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, no, I see it now.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.905
- It's amazing.
- You're very polite.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.200
Which reminds me my mother says hello.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.162
She wanted to be here,
but she was busy with silence and alcohol.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.500
Okay. Official introductions.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.921
Mom and Dad, this is Aniq.
Aniq, Vivian and Feng.

09:47.921 --> 09:52.634
Please, call me the King of Bing.
There is none higher!

09:52.634 --> 09:55.971
Taiwanese shaved ice, right?
Zoë was telling me all about it.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.432
It's kind of like Hawaiian shaved ice, right?

09:59.933 --> 10:05.230
No. Taiwanese shaved ice
is smooth and delicious.

10:05.230 --> 10:09.401
Hawaiian shaved ice is sharp like knives.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.362
I wouldn't throw Hawaiian shaved ice
in the toilet.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.655
I'm sorry.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.408
Aniq, it's nice to meet you.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.077
- Just so you know, we always hated Brett.
- Mom.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.412
- He's an idiot.
- Dad.

10:20.412 --> 10:24.166
Well, I can assure you,
I am definitely not an idiot.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.126
- Your car is moving.
- What's that?

10:27.252 --> 10:30.964
- Oh, no. No.
- My truck!

10:32.132 --> 10:33.300
No.

10:41.517 --> 10:44.144
You crashed your car while it was parked?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.812
That's some funny shit, man.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.107
I was nervous. I left it in neutral.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.568
And it wasn't funny. He was really upset.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.656
<i>No. It's rom-com funny.
Like, "Uh-oh, this fool's in trouble."</i>

10:56.198 --> 10:58.283
This is a brand-new truck. It's ruined.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.245
- Kyler, film this for insurance, please.
- Got him.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.205
Hello?

11:03.205 --> 11:05.916
- No, not him, the truck.
- Sorry.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.545
Aniq, this is Kyler, the King of Bing's
new social media manager.

11:09.545 --> 11:12.297
Hi. Nice to meet you.
You dropped your Obama puppet.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.382
My what?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.429
<i>So, yeah. Not a great start.</i>

11:21.014 --> 11:24.268
<i>But I decided the rehearsal dinner was
my chance to show Zoë's parents</i>

11:24.268 --> 11:25.936
<i>I'm good for their daughter.</i>

11:27.980 --> 11:29.857
<i>Unfortunately, for some reason,</i>

11:29.857 --> 11:33.443
<i>I was seated far away at the singles table
with the weirdos and ex-boyfriends.</i>

11:34.778 --> 11:37.906
Let me guess.
You're also one of Grace's exes.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.242
- What?
- She has a type.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.703
No. I'm here with Zoë.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.830
So you're one of the sister's exes?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.415
No, I'm the sister's current.

11:46.415 --> 11:51.378
I guess I just assumed she was
with that tall glass of sexy water.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.216
- Who's that?
- That would be the best man.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.509
Edgar's business partner.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.470
Calls himself Sebastian.
Probably a fake name.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.599
Hey, do you know anything
about cryptocurrency?

12:03.599 --> 12:06.393
You know what?
I think I'm gonna try and change tables.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.021
So Edgar can tell that
this guy's all mouth, no trousers.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.565
He looks him dead in the eye, and he says,

12:11.565 --> 12:15.194
"You can take it or leave it.
But if you leave, I'm taking it anyway."

12:17.362 --> 12:19.281
See, now that's playing hardball.
I love it.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.950
Yeah, me too.
You know, I love me some hard balls.

12:26.205 --> 12:28.123
That was awkward,

12:28.123 --> 12:31.001
and then your partner had to laugh
to cover over the silence.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.589
Where were you? I was looking for you.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.633
Somebody sat me at the singles table.

12:38.467 --> 12:41.053
That was Isabel, my mother.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.472
Well, this is the family table.
Are you family?

12:44.056 --> 12:47.142
Because no one told me
that you two were married.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.561
No. We're not married, per se.

12:49.561 --> 12:50.896
- We're dating.
- We're dating.

12:50.896 --> 12:53.649
Then I sat you
where you were supposed to sit.

12:54.483 --> 12:57.694
Okay. Well, so, now you've met Isabel.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.989
And this is Hannah, Edgar's sister.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.741
- Well, adopted.
- I see.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.287
- If you want.
- I would--

13:10.082 --> 13:12.543
Aniq, heard you already made
quite an impact.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.086
Because, the car.

13:14.086 --> 13:16.505
Sebastian.
The better man, 'cause Edgar's the best.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.631
Okay.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.800
- No kiss for me?
- I mean, if you want me to.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.844
- I love kissing hands.
- No. Crikey.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.679
No. Not really--

13:23.679 --> 13:26.056
Feng, Vivian, sure you want
your daughter dating this guy?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.391
Hide your hands, everyone.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.519
The Palm Pervert is at large.

13:30.519 --> 13:33.355
Mine's scared. Mine's very scared.

13:35.065 --> 13:36.441
I think that's enough.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.818
Who would like a drink?

13:39.403 --> 13:42.739
This is juicy.
You're at the rehearsal dinner.

13:42.739 --> 13:46.285
<i>There's a handsome guy charming your girl
while you're embarrassing yourself.</i>

13:46.285 --> 13:47.953
You know what this sounds like to me?

13:48.620 --> 13:49.830
I know. Sequel.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.957
So, Hannah was just telling us

13:51.957 --> 13:55.502
about these interesting
flower arrangements she's made.

13:56.128 --> 13:59.756
Yeah, every flower you see before you
is from Hannah's garden of the bizarre.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.926
And some of these
are actually psychotropic.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.345
Aniq knows what I'm talking about.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.638
- No, I don't.
- Smoking that--

14:08.599 --> 14:11.143
- No.
- What a big surprise.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.103
Table crasher is a drug user.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.647
No, I don't do drugs actually.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.732
Oh, come on.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.276
I mean, not that I haven't done them.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.237
It's just that I don't, like, do them.
You know what I mean?

14:22.237 --> 14:23.739
I'm not, like, "Get my fix."

14:23.739 --> 14:26.950
This thing on? Quick announcement.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.746
Could the owner of the blue sedan
with the mangled bumper

14:30.746 --> 14:32.873
please learn how to use a hand brake?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.709
Your car is still rolling.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.880
There he is. The world's worst valet.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.884
It's not that funny.

14:43.884 --> 14:47.804
I'm here to introduce
a very special surprise.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.641
As many of you know, Edgar is not
comfortable in front of crowds.

14:50.641 --> 14:52.226
- I'm not.
- So he asked me,

14:52.226 --> 14:55.479
who quite frankly can't get enough
of being in front of them,

14:56.104 --> 14:58.023
to introduce a very special guest.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.986
It's a relative of Grace's that
she hasn't seen for a long, long time.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.740
But Edgar wanted to do something
particularly special for today,

15:06.740 --> 15:11.078
so he searched the whole goddamn globe
to find him.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.705
- Oh, my God, he didn't.
- What? What's happening?

15:13.705 --> 15:17.209
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to have your socks blown off.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.671
Grace's uncle, Feng's brother, Ulysses.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.097
Funcle Ulysses!

15:36.311 --> 15:38.897
Funcle? What's that-- Oh, yeah. Fun uncle?

15:38.897 --> 15:40.315
That's what they call him.

15:43.819 --> 15:45.696
- Come.
- Oh, my God.

15:46.864 --> 15:52.244
If you will indulge a weary traveler,
a toast.

15:52.244 --> 15:55.789
To my dear niece,
whom I love so very much.

15:56.707 --> 16:00.627
I left you many moons ago, but know this.

16:00.627 --> 16:05.549
You, your sister,
you have always had my heart.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.134
And to Edgar.

16:07.134 --> 16:11.096
Now, normally
when one of these ultra-rich earth-rapers

16:11.096 --> 16:13.807
shows up on my proverbial doorstep,
I'd try to take him down,

16:14.391 --> 16:18.312
not lift my glass to him
but I hear he makes my Grace happy.

16:18.312 --> 16:20.814
However, if you break her heart,

16:22.274 --> 16:26.153
I will slice your throat with
the curved blade of my Yemeni jambiya.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.239
I'm kidding.

16:32.743 --> 16:34.411
- Or am I?
- I don't know.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.496
In the Scythian tribe
of the Central Asian Steppes,

16:36.496 --> 16:40.334
the family will drink
an ancient, traditional wedding...

16:42.544 --> 16:43.545
koumiss.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.632
They believe it brings prosperity
to the newlywed couple.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.635
First, the bride.

16:49.635 --> 16:51.637
That's me. Okay.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.222
Just like...

16:58.977 --> 17:00.312
- Wow.
- Yes.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.856
- Thank you. Wow.
- You are welcome.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.568
- And now the groom.
- No, thank you.

17:07.069 --> 17:08.987
Roxana is disgusted by the smell,

17:08.987 --> 17:11.365
and if she doesn't like it,
I won't like it either.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.616
But it's tradition.

17:12.616 --> 17:15.117
Drinking it will mean
you're a part of our family.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.162
You know, I'll drink it. Yeah.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.247
You are?

17:18.247 --> 17:19.623
I'm Aniq.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.083
What is an Aniq?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.376
I'm dating Zoë.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.461
So, you know,
that's why I'm at the main table.

17:24.461 --> 17:25.378
I belong here.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.005
- This guy.
- Very well.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.258
Aniq shall drink of my horn.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.803
All right. Well...

17:35.138 --> 17:36.265
Bottoms up.

17:36.265 --> 17:38.517
Funcle, what exactly is koumiss?

17:39.059 --> 17:40.227
Fermented camel's milk.

17:43.522 --> 17:44.731
So chunky.

17:46.692 --> 17:47.526
Mom.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.069
Oh, no.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.989
<i>You spit camel's milk
on the mother of the bride?</i>

17:52.489 --> 17:55.284
I know, right?
More rom-com shenanigans, huh?

17:55.284 --> 17:56.243
Sequel.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.495
<i>No, that's gross.</i>

17:59.955 --> 18:03.375
All I wanted from this weekend
is for your parents to not hate me.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.459
Then what do I do?

18:04.459 --> 18:07.796
I crash my car into your dad's truck,
I blow chunks all over your mom--

18:07.796 --> 18:08.964
- And switch.
- Yep.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.718
And then Grace gives me
that beautiful tea cozy,

18:12.718 --> 18:14.261
and then I run it over.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.555
Hey. I promise they don't hate you.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.098
They don't hate anyone.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.059
Well, they hated Brett. That was
the first thing they said, literally.

18:21.059 --> 18:23.395
Oh, my God. Brett! That's it.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.814
Have you noticed
how strange Grace is acting?

18:25.814 --> 18:29.610
Not really. But maybe she's upset because
I spit camel's milk all over your mom.

18:29.610 --> 18:32.154
No, I noticed it
at the bachelorette party too.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.199
She's acting the same way I did
right before I married Brett.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.451
Like she knows
she's about to make a huge mistake,

18:37.451 --> 18:39.620
but she doesn't know how to get out of it.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.331
Are you saying that because Edgar
didn't wanna try your uncle's horn milk?

18:42.331 --> 18:43.999
Because I think that was a good call.

18:43.999 --> 18:45.876
They're, like, complete opposites.

18:45.876 --> 18:51.298
Grace is this romantic, magical weirdo
who loves antiques,

18:51.298 --> 18:54.051
and Edgar is, like, an awkward tech guy

18:54.051 --> 18:57.513
who goes to sleep at 9:30 every night
and has a weird lizard pet.

18:57.513 --> 19:01.141
You know, just 'cause someone's
a little awkward and dorky

19:01.141 --> 19:04.394
doesn't make him
not great marriage material, right?

19:05.229 --> 19:06.146
Look at this.

19:07.648 --> 19:12.653
Could you just imagine me sitting here
in my finest anime-inspired robe?

19:12.653 --> 19:16.281
- Hot.
- And a samurai sword, also from an anime.

19:18.492 --> 19:23.205
I'm just saying
it's an odd match for Grace.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.165
Do you think I should talk to her?

19:26.041 --> 19:30.170
- Well, I think you love your sister.
- Yeah.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.756
So, maybe just feel it out, yeah?

19:33.423 --> 19:34.258
Okay.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.345
Have you seen my phone charger?
My mom needs to borrow it.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.557
Maybe I can lend her mine? Yeah?

19:42.349 --> 19:44.268
That way I can apologize to her

19:44.268 --> 19:46.395
- and show that I'm useful?
- Sure.

19:47.938 --> 19:51.316
<i>I had no idea
what I was gonna say to Vivian.</i>

19:51.316 --> 19:53.527
<i>I just knew I needed to say something</i>

19:53.527 --> 19:55.737
<i>if I wanted to salvage
getting their blessing.</i>

19:55.737 --> 19:58.365
I'm not overreacting.
You always say that. No--

19:58.365 --> 20:00.158
- Calm down.
- No. I'm not--

20:00.158 --> 20:02.119
- We're not gonna solve anything...
- You know what?

20:02.119 --> 20:04.329
Look, I'm not gonna
let him ruin our family.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.414
It's too late now.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.666
It's not too late.
There are things we can do.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.085
But what are the options?

20:11.253 --> 20:12.212
The hell?

20:12.212 --> 20:13.630
Aniq?

20:14.923 --> 20:16.633
- Hello.
- What are you doing out there?

20:16.633 --> 20:18.135
- What did you hear?
- Was that guy naked?

20:19.136 --> 20:21.054
I don't know who that was.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.765
See, I was just hiding
in the bushes, separate--

20:24.558 --> 20:28.687
I was--
I came to give you this phone charger.

20:28.687 --> 20:29.771
And that's done,

20:29.771 --> 20:32.900
so I'm gonna head back to the cottage
and sleep with your daughter.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.444
Not with. Next to.

20:35.444 --> 20:41.366
'Cause we sleep in the same space, not w--

20:41.950 --> 20:45.120
Not that we haven't, 'cause we are
a couple, and we have been for a year.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.538
We're not gonna do it tonight.

20:47.706 --> 20:48.707
Not that we couldn't.

20:50.042 --> 20:54.671
But to say that to you seems very rude,
so I will-- I'ma take that back.

20:54.671 --> 20:55.756
I'm gonna n--

20:59.843 --> 21:00.844
Just g--

21:02.012 --> 21:05.599
All this crazy shit keeps happening to you
and you just trying to make the best of it

21:05.599 --> 21:08.644
'cause you love Zoë so much.

21:08.644 --> 21:10.854
And I do. I love her very much.

21:11.605 --> 21:15.150
<i>A double, dinosaur-style.
Drag that through the garden.</i>

21:15.859 --> 21:18.153
- What?
- <i>I'm getting me something to nibble on.</i>

21:18.153 --> 21:20.739
- You hungry?
- No, I think I'm good.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.957
Hey. How are you doing?

21:31.166 --> 21:33.752
I was gonna give Edgar
this tea cozy for our honeymoon,

21:33.752 --> 21:35.337
but now that he's dead,

21:35.337 --> 21:39.299
do you think it makes me look more guilty
if I finish it or if I don't?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.552
I don't know about that.

21:42.386 --> 21:45.848
But what I do know is that
we're gonna get you out of this, okay?

21:46.431 --> 21:48.141
Aniq is already working on it,

21:48.141 --> 21:52.312
and he was instrumental
in figuring out who killed Xavier so...

21:52.312 --> 21:53.438
- He was?
- Yeah.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.983
And there is no evidence that you did it.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.568
It could've been anyone.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.236
Right.

22:01.405 --> 22:03.615
- I mean, even you could've done it.
- What?

22:03.615 --> 22:06.243
You never liked Edgar.
You made that very clear.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.203
And now we're not married anymore.

22:08.203 --> 22:09.872
- So you got what you wanted.
- Grace.

22:10.998 --> 22:13.625
Hey. Come on!

22:14.209 --> 22:15.169
Oh, boy.

22:15.169 --> 22:18.964
Looks like our girl might be suffering
from a little hypoperfusion.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.757
Why are you still here?

22:21.508 --> 22:22.634
Did you sleep here?

22:22.634 --> 22:26.889
To the layman, or laywoman,
we call it shock.

22:28.056 --> 22:30.934
I know what you're thinking.
This is not my first rodeo.

22:31.977 --> 22:34.813
You would be right,
if by "rodeo" you mean "murder".

22:35.647 --> 22:37.024
I'm part of a Reddit guild.

22:37.024 --> 22:39.151
We have our hands
on a bunch of these cases.

22:39.151 --> 22:42.404
We've helped solve the Modesto Strangler,
the Bisbee Beast,

22:42.404 --> 22:44.531
even that guy in Stanley, Idaho,

22:44.531 --> 22:48.785
who we think may have hid his wife's body
in a beanbag chair.

22:49.828 --> 22:52.331
- Wow.
- Police don't wanna touch that one.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.583
Even though
there were some oddly shaped shadows

22:54.583 --> 22:56.418
in the photos of the beanbag chair.

22:57.044 --> 23:03.050
But irregardless,
another piping-hot case goes cold.

23:06.261 --> 23:08.055
All right. Wedding day.

23:08.764 --> 23:10.098
Tell me everything.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.060
<i>Okay. Zoë and I woke up early</i>

23:13.060 --> 23:15.354
<i>and headed to the main house
for breakfast.</i>

23:15.354 --> 23:17.856
- And that's the strawberry.
- Thank you so much.

23:21.485 --> 23:24.863
There he is. Mr. Groom.
A little underdressed for a wedding, huh?

23:24.863 --> 23:26.573
I'm doing my morning laps.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.992
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I was just making a joke.

23:28.992 --> 23:32.120
I like jokes. So does Roxana.

23:32.120 --> 23:33.330
Okay.

23:33.330 --> 23:37.292
Roxana loves Frank Caliendo,
and I love Garrison Keillor.

23:45.843 --> 23:46.844
Hey, buddy.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.600
Hey. Okay. Please stop that.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.310
That's Colonel.

23:55.310 --> 24:00.274
He was my husband's dog,
but unlike my husband, he refuses to die.

24:00.274 --> 24:02.818
Well, he seems to have my pant leg.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.069
Yeah, just kick him away.

24:04.570 --> 24:06.655
- I'm not gonna kick a dog.
- Just do it. Just kick him.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.407
It's the only way he'll respect you.

24:09.658 --> 24:10.659
Dominate him.

24:10.659 --> 24:14.037
Just stop that, please.
I'm gonna dominate you.

24:14.037 --> 24:15.998
Neither of us want that, but...

24:15.998 --> 24:17.791
- Kick him.
- All right!

24:18.959 --> 24:20.836
Did you just kick that dog?

24:20.836 --> 24:24.673
- What?
- Did you just kick that dog?

24:24.673 --> 24:28.552
No. Well-- She told me to.

24:28.552 --> 24:31.513
She-- I was dominating him.

24:32.181 --> 24:33.432
As per instructions.

24:33.974 --> 24:36.435
Zozo, I need to talk to the caterers.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.437
Could you please
pick up your Korean uncles

24:38.437 --> 24:40.606
and your Chinese aunties from the motel?

24:40.606 --> 24:42.691
Well, I was gonna help Grace get ready.

24:42.691 --> 24:45.652
- I can do it.
- I don't know. It's a family thing.

24:45.652 --> 24:48.989
And if you drive like you park,
I just don't have the bandwidth to--

24:48.989 --> 24:50.824
Dad, let him do it. He wants to.

24:51.575 --> 24:52.784
It would be my greatest honor.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.829
Okay. You're not winning a medal.
You're driving to a motel.

24:55.829 --> 24:56.788
Yes, correct.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.249
What's that smell?

25:00.167 --> 25:05.506
You know, that's me. I still have
that old camel milk smell from last night.

25:05.506 --> 25:08.592
So, you know what?
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

25:08.592 --> 25:11.261
Then I'm gonna pick up your family,
and I won't let you down.

25:21.647 --> 25:22.689
Hello?

25:26.151 --> 25:27.152
Aniq, it's you.

25:28.070 --> 25:30.239
<i>Habari za asubuhi</i>, as they say in Swahili.

25:30.239 --> 25:32.282
I slept under the stars last night.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.117
Zoë told me I could use the shower.

25:34.117 --> 25:38.455
The waterfalls near Kilimanjaro
are cleansing but ice-cold.

25:38.455 --> 25:40.666
- Yeah.
- I can skip it though if you need to--

25:40.666 --> 25:43.168
No. Yeah, no. Take your time.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.378
- You sure?
- Yeah.

25:44.378 --> 25:46.255
Very roomy shower.

25:46.255 --> 25:48.006
No. I'm good.

25:48.715 --> 25:52.511
- All right. Be done in a jiff.
- Okay.

26:01.395 --> 26:06.358
<i>Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?</i>

26:06.358 --> 26:09.403
You know what? I'm just gonna go!
I'll shower later!

26:16.910 --> 26:19.413
Well, you look like some people
who wanna go to a vineyard.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.123
I'm Aniq, Zoë's boyfriend.

26:21.874 --> 26:24.793
Not family but almost. Maybe.

26:26.712 --> 26:28.088
You speak a little Mandarin?

26:29.548 --> 26:30.924
And Korean.

26:30.924 --> 26:32.509
I studied up for the weekend.

26:32.509 --> 26:34.178
Please get in. Come on.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.513
I like him.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.516
Aniq!

26:39.516 --> 26:42.019
Come with me if you wanna know
the real truth about the truth.

26:42.936 --> 26:44.146
We gotta save Grace.

26:44.146 --> 26:45.814
No. You know, I think I'm good.

26:45.814 --> 26:47.900
- I don't know him.
- You know what? Okay.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.402
To the vineyard!

26:54.156 --> 26:55.657
- Thank you.
- Of course.

26:56.366 --> 26:58.952
Hello, kind sir. Special delivery.

26:58.952 --> 27:01.413
Right on time, just as promised.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.957
Hi! Hello!

27:05.083 --> 27:06.710
Who are these people?

27:08.045 --> 27:10.255
I don't think I understand the question.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.132
This isn't my family.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.844
I said,
"Korean uncles and Chinese aunties."

27:15.844 --> 27:20.307
These are clearly Chinese uncles
and Korean aunties.

27:20.307 --> 27:23.644
No. They were outside the motel.
They said they wanted to go to a vineyard.

27:26.104 --> 27:28.607
- Who are you people?
- We're here for the wine tasting.

27:28.607 --> 27:30.817
Where is my family?

27:31.401 --> 27:32.402
It's a good q--

27:34.279 --> 27:35.906
Greetings and salutations.

27:36.532 --> 27:37.699
Look who I found.

27:37.699 --> 27:40.827
Isn't he handsome? Our ride never came.

27:43.038 --> 27:44.414
The more the merrier, I think.

27:45.958 --> 27:48.418
<i>So Johnny English showed you up again?</i>

27:48.418 --> 27:50.045
<i>What did you do with the randos?</i>

27:50.045 --> 27:52.714
<i>I swiped a couple bottles of wine
from the caterers, gave 'em to the group,</i>

27:52.714 --> 27:53.882
<i>and took them back to the hotel.</i>

27:54.967 --> 27:57.010
<i>I was finally about to take a shower when...</i>

28:01.223 --> 28:02.975
There he is. The hand kisser.

28:02.975 --> 28:04.768
Okay. I think you misunderstood.

28:04.768 --> 28:06.478
I don't actually kiss hands.

28:06.478 --> 28:08.897
I was just being charming.
You know, it was a little joke.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.108
- I don't actually care.
- I don't either.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.776
Edgar needs help tying a bow tie.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.279
I do know how to tie a bow tie.

28:15.279 --> 28:18.282
Yes. I felt like that might be
in your wheelhouse.

28:24.705 --> 28:26.623
Your personal dresser has arrived.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.708
Aniq.

28:28.292 --> 28:31.461
- Ever seen anything like those before?
- What, the cuff links?

28:31.461 --> 28:33.297
He's talking about my cryptokeys.

28:34.339 --> 28:37.843
Couple of hundred million dollars
right there. And going up.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.928
You ever dig your snout
in the crypto trough?

28:39.928 --> 28:43.223
No. My snout is crypto-clean.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.559
- I'm ready to be tied.
- Okay. Great.

28:49.730 --> 28:52.065
- Hey.
- She likes you.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.234
- Hello.
- She never liked me.

28:54.234 --> 28:55.152
Ignore him.

28:55.152 --> 28:59.156
Right on the desk there's a wooden box.
In it are white chocolate chips.

28:59.156 --> 29:00.365
They're her favorite.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.951
- Feed her one. Feed it to her.
- Yep. Okay. Yeah.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.623
You know, fun fact about white chocolate:

29:07.623 --> 29:10.542
It's called chocolate,
but it contains no cacao,

29:10.542 --> 29:13.170
so it really shouldn't be allowed
to be called chocolate.

29:13.170 --> 29:15.047
Yes. It's an impostor dessert.

29:15.047 --> 29:16.423
I've always said that.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.300
People only trust it
because it's white and fancy.

29:18.300 --> 29:19.801
It's the Bernie Madoff of dessert.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.553
It's, like, an imperialist tool.

29:21.553 --> 29:23.013
But Roxana likes it.

29:23.013 --> 29:25.098
It's one of the only things she likes
that I don't like,

29:25.098 --> 29:26.725
but I like her to feel independent.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.269
- Feed her.
- All right.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.271
Hey.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.944
Just scarfing that bad boy down,
isn't she?

29:36.944 --> 29:41.823
Listen. Is there a sweeter sound
than the happy mastication of a lizard?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.784
If there is, I'd love to hear it.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.668
I'm going to leave you gentlemen to it.

29:54.878 --> 29:55.879
Yeah.

29:56.672 --> 29:58.882
Well, I'm gonna tie your tie here for you.

30:00.050 --> 30:01.510
Let's see. Okay.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.136
There we are.

30:04.346 --> 30:05.931
So, you're planning to propose to Zoë?

30:06.849 --> 30:07.724
How did you...

30:07.724 --> 30:09.142
Just observation.

30:09.142 --> 30:11.395
You seem very anxious
around Feng and Vivian.

30:11.395 --> 30:12.855
Elevated sweat levels.

30:12.855 --> 30:15.524
You do a weird smile
that looks more like fear than joy.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.359
Not a difficult puzzle to solve.

30:17.985 --> 30:22.990
I was planning to propose this weekend,
but I've just been screwing everything up.

30:24.116 --> 30:25.909
And there.

30:28.662 --> 30:29.663
I like you, Aniq.

30:30.706 --> 30:32.958
I think I may have a way to help.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.045
Hey!

30:37.546 --> 30:41.341
- Hey.
- Oh, my God. You look amazing.

30:41.842 --> 30:44.428
- Thank you.
- You're never gonna guess what happened.

30:44.428 --> 30:46.346
Edgar asked me to be part of the wedding.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.056
He thinks if I'm part of the ceremony,

30:48.056 --> 30:49.850
I can show your parents
how responsible I am.

30:49.850 --> 30:51.226
I told Grace
I don't think she should marry him.

30:51.226 --> 30:53.395
- You what?
- We just got into a huge fight,

30:53.395 --> 30:56.356
and she asked me point-blank
if I think she should marry Edgar,

30:56.356 --> 30:58.066
and I said no.

31:00.277 --> 31:03.947
That's okay. It will be okay.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.451
Why did you say that?

31:07.451 --> 31:09.286
Well, 'cause obviously she's not happy.

31:09.286 --> 31:12.039
And now she's mad at me,
and I don't know what to do.

31:13.582 --> 31:14.666
Is the wedding still happening?

31:14.666 --> 31:16.877
Of course the wedding's still happening.
It's in ten minutes.

31:16.877 --> 31:18.837
- Ten minutes?
- I shouldn't have said anything.

31:18.837 --> 31:20.964
- Do I still smell like koumiss?
- Why did I do that?

31:20.964 --> 31:22.925
I don't have time to shower.
I'm part of the wedding!

31:22.925 --> 31:25.093
<i>Why did Zoë tell her sister
not to get married</i>

31:25.093 --> 31:26.512
<i>just before the wedding?</i>

31:26.512 --> 31:29.389
<i>I don't know. I was so late,
I didn't have time to think about it.</i>

31:29.389 --> 31:32.100
We're gathered here today
to witness the matrimony

31:32.100 --> 31:33.352
of Edgar and Grace.

31:33.352 --> 31:36.897
Grace and Edgar have entrusted me,
an anointed rabbi

31:36.897 --> 31:40.025
and registered witch doctor,
just in the state of Arizona,

31:40.025 --> 31:42.986
with officiating these sacred vows
of marriage.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.781
But first,
I'd like to begin with a parable.

31:46.782 --> 31:49.576
Two beautiful hairless mermen
swim through the sea.

31:49.576 --> 31:52.579
- A third merman approaches and says...
- Sorry I'm late.

31:52.579 --> 31:56.542
It was a very busy morning.
I had to tie Edgar's bow tie.

31:56.542 --> 31:58.710
- What the hell is water?
- Very.

32:00.087 --> 32:02.464
Okay, and now
the presentation of the vow box.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.884
That's me. Edgar asked me
to be a part of the wedding.

32:05.884 --> 32:08.262
So, that's me. Okay.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.556
I'm the vow box guy.

32:11.139 --> 32:14.268
- Where's the vow box?
- Right there.

32:15.477 --> 32:16.645
What do I do with it?

32:17.271 --> 32:18.564
Put it on our heads.

32:18.564 --> 32:19.898
<i>What the hell?</i>

32:19.898 --> 32:22.442
Edgar really doesn't like public speaking.
Or he didn't.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.528
<i>So he didn't wanna say his vows
in front of everyone.</i>

32:24.528 --> 32:27.197
Apparently it's a thing
at weddings in Silicon Valley.

32:27.197 --> 32:31.034
It's a thing to put your heads
inside of a upside-down coffin?

32:31.034 --> 32:33.453
Also, it was very heavy.

32:37.165 --> 32:38.709
- You got it, babe.
- Thanks, baby.

32:38.709 --> 32:39.960
Bend at the knee.

32:39.960 --> 32:42.004
Yeah. I think it's a little late for that.

32:42.004 --> 32:44.631
And now the vow box.

32:45.507 --> 32:46.633
At this moment. Yeah.

32:48.302 --> 32:49.344
Okay!

32:53.432 --> 32:54.766
Aniq!

32:55.267 --> 32:57.811
- Hey!
- No, I got it.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.814
- How many steps, baby? Okay.
- Two more steps.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.859
- Yep.
- Watch out. He's falling off.

33:05.110 --> 33:06.195
He's like a horse.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.988
- All right. So that's one, two?
- Yep.

33:07.988 --> 33:09.198
Okay. Yeah. That's good.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.159
- All good?
- Okay. Yep.

33:12.159 --> 33:13.285
Okay.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.330
- Something's touching my hand!
- It's Grace.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.497
- Who's that?
- Grace.

33:17.497 --> 33:18.415
- Grace.
- Okay.

33:18.415 --> 33:20.334
- I'm in.
- Whenever you're ready, Edgar,

33:20.334 --> 33:21.919
go ahead and pop yourself under there.

33:21.919 --> 33:24.379
I'm gonna use Grace as a fulcrum, essentially.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.381
Please don't use my fiancée as a fulcrum.

33:26.381 --> 33:27.966
I got very few options here.

33:27.966 --> 33:31.345
All right, great.
Now kind of, like, straighten up. And...

33:31.929 --> 33:33.514
Beautiful. Great.

33:34.056 --> 33:34.932
- Fuck!
- That's really loud.

33:34.932 --> 33:36.767
Oh, my God. My ear is ringing.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.604
Ladies and gentlemen, the vow box.

33:42.231 --> 33:44.024
I know I'm stuck in my ways,

33:44.024 --> 33:45.484
but, Grace, when I look at you...

33:46.777 --> 33:48.779
That awful box was your idea?

33:49.279 --> 33:51.573
No, it wasn't my idea.
I was just in charge of it.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.369
And that concludes the vows.

33:58.205 --> 33:59.206
Fuck's sake.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.960
All right, big smiles. This is great.

34:04.002 --> 34:06.880
All right.
Can I get one with both families?

34:06.880 --> 34:08.507
- Yes!
- Come on.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.552
Yeah, you think? I don't know if I should.

34:11.552 --> 34:14.137
No, the photographer did say family only.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.431
Yeah. You know what? Yeah. Go ahead.

34:16.431 --> 34:17.808
I'll hop in the next one.

34:17.808 --> 34:20.643
Okay. Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just going to say it.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.437
Maybe one without the lizard?

34:22.437 --> 34:23.647
Aniq can hold it.

34:23.647 --> 34:26.567
I don't know, Edgar.
Guy's not the most reliable.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.360
Maybe you should let Sebastian hold it.

34:28.944 --> 34:31.947
Absolutely not. I want Aniq to hold her.

34:32.739 --> 34:35.074
He's strong. He's kind.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.369
He has one of the best escape rooms
on all of Yelp.

34:37.953 --> 34:40.621
And it may not be the most profitable,
the most famous,

34:40.621 --> 34:41.831
but it's the most confusing.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.625
- Thank you.
- And here.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.839
You can take my mother's purse
and hold it too.

34:52.259 --> 34:54.511
- I told you he's unreliable.
- Dad.

34:54.511 --> 34:55.929
Well, he is.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.276
Well, at least you like me, huh?

35:10.819 --> 35:12.196
You want an appetizer?

35:13.655 --> 35:14.656
I don't know what that is.

35:14.656 --> 35:16.491
Looks like dog food on a cracker.

35:17.826 --> 35:18.827
I think it's poke.

35:18.827 --> 35:23.624
What's that supposed to mean?
Are you asking me if I've been in jail?

35:23.624 --> 35:27.127
I think you're thinking of pokey
and what I said was poke.

35:27.127 --> 35:30.797
Ooh la la.
Why would I be in a French jail?

35:32.424 --> 35:33.467
Okay.

35:34.092 --> 35:36.178
Well, Roxana, do you like fish?

35:40.766 --> 35:41.767
Oh, no.

35:42.935 --> 35:45.479
Roxana.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.566
Roxana. Hello.

35:49.566 --> 35:51.026
- Roxana.
- Hey!

35:51.026 --> 35:52.569
You all right there, buddy?

35:53.070 --> 35:54.363
Roxana.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.574
Hey, pup.

35:58.951 --> 36:00.953
- Aniq?
- Hey.

36:01.787 --> 36:03.121
Why are you under the table?

36:03.830 --> 36:07.543
Did you lose
my impressive son-in-law's lizard?

36:07.543 --> 36:10.003
No. I was playing a game with it.

36:10.003 --> 36:11.797
Because it suggested the game.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.925
It's a lizard-
and hide-and-seek-themed game

36:14.925 --> 36:16.760
called hide-and-lizard.

36:16.760 --> 36:17.970
- All right.
- What?

36:17.970 --> 36:22.599
Yo, everybody! Put your shit down.

36:22.599 --> 36:26.311
It's time for the dance
with the tall guy and his bride.

36:26.311 --> 36:27.479
Here we go.

36:32.568 --> 36:33.986
Yay!

36:33.986 --> 36:35.863
Yes.

36:37.406 --> 36:38.448
That's nice.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.453
<i>I looked for Roxana everywhere.</i>

36:43.453 --> 36:45.122
<i>I mean, everywhere.</i>

36:45.122 --> 36:48.584
Don't be dead.

36:48.584 --> 36:52.129
Well, Grace won't talk to me.
Full cold shoulder.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.256
- What are you doing?
- I lost Roxana.

36:54.256 --> 36:55.507
I've looked everywhere for her.

36:55.507 --> 36:58.218
White chocolate's her favorite snack.
What if she fell in and drowned?

36:58.218 --> 36:59.720
- Oh, no!
- Hey, it's okay.

36:59.720 --> 37:02.431
Look, Edgar's lizard is
right over there on his shoulder.

37:02.431 --> 37:04.725
- How the hell did that happen?
- I don't know.

37:04.725 --> 37:06.602
I've got my own stuff going on, okay?

37:06.602 --> 37:08.687
Hey. No. Hey, look.

37:09.313 --> 37:11.607
I'm sure you and Grace
are gonna be able to patch things up.

37:12.357 --> 37:13.650
You just need to talk to her.

37:15.194 --> 37:16.862
My maid-of-honor speech.

37:16.862 --> 37:19.198
It is literally all about
how much I love her.

37:19.198 --> 37:21.617
She's gotta listen to that, right?

37:21.617 --> 37:23.160
Yeah, that's perfect.

37:23.911 --> 37:24.912
And, hey,

37:26.371 --> 37:27.789
you're gonna do great.

37:27.789 --> 37:28.874
Okay.

37:32.461 --> 37:37.132
You table-crashing drug addict thief!
Give me my purse back.

37:37.674 --> 37:39.593
You've been hiding it from me.

37:39.593 --> 37:42.679
What? I wasn't hiding it.
I was holding it.

37:42.679 --> 37:44.806
And I did a pretty good job.

37:44.806 --> 37:46.683
Relationships.

37:47.267 --> 37:49.853
There's one, there's two,

37:49.853 --> 37:54.316
and... blah, blah, blah.

37:57.653 --> 37:58.487
Who cares?

37:58.487 --> 38:00.113
This is her speech?

38:00.113 --> 38:02.449
- Yep. Nobody cares. Okay?
- I don't know

38:02.449 --> 38:06.036
whether she's lost her marbles
or if she's just being vindictive,

38:06.036 --> 38:08.247
but she has been so nasty to Grace
all weekend.

38:08.247 --> 38:09.331
You missed it.

38:14.461 --> 38:16.922
No, don't clap. I don't need your pity.

38:16.922 --> 38:18.048
Okay.

38:18.048 --> 38:23.470
And here with the next toast
is the maid of honor, aka the sister,

38:23.470 --> 38:27.140
and definitely my type. Zoë!

38:27.850 --> 38:28.851
Save me a dance.

38:40.195 --> 38:44.700
Grace, you are my sister, but you--

38:46.451 --> 38:47.744
What is that?

38:49.288 --> 38:50.289
Go on.

38:54.835 --> 38:56.211
But you are so much more--

38:59.173 --> 39:01.675
a sibling. You're a confid--

39:05.637 --> 39:08.807
Whoever's making that sound, please stop.
Roxana hates it.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.228
Okay. Yeah, next speech.

39:16.148 --> 39:18.066
Oh, come on. You can do better than that.

39:20.194 --> 39:21.612
That's more like it.

39:22.196 --> 39:23.405
Yeah!

39:23.989 --> 39:24.865
There we are.

39:25.365 --> 39:27.326
Ladies, gentlemen, reptiles.

39:29.536 --> 39:31.121
I speak for us all when I say,

39:31.121 --> 39:35.459
we are so delighted that you have found
someone that truly understands you,

39:36.001 --> 39:39.630
that makes you a better man,
and looks damn fine whilst doing it.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.131
But enough about me.

39:43.342 --> 39:46.053
- Hey, are you okay?
- Fucking Edgar.

39:46.553 --> 39:50.349
And please,
let us raise a toast to the happy couple.

39:50.349 --> 39:52.476
To the happy couple! Cheers!

39:52.976 --> 39:54.561
<i>Zoë was pissed, huh?</i>

39:54.561 --> 39:56.688
<i>Yeah. I didn't know what to do.</i>

39:56.688 --> 40:00.108
<i>But I still smelled like koumiss, so
I showered and headed to the after-party.</i>

40:00.108 --> 40:02.528
Okay. That was pretty good.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.821
<i>And even though everything had gone wrong,</i>

40:04.821 --> 40:07.324
<i>I knew if I was going to get
Zoë's parents' blessing,</i>

40:07.991 --> 40:09.493
<i>this was my last chance.</i>

40:11.537 --> 40:13.497
But don't make it easy for me.

40:20.754 --> 40:22.047
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:24.842 --> 40:26.760
I just wanted to apologize.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.555
I just really want you to like me.

40:29.555 --> 40:30.806
I can see that.

40:31.390 --> 40:33.183
Do you know who you remind me of?

40:35.269 --> 40:36.270
No, who?

40:36.270 --> 40:37.521
Brett.

40:37.521 --> 40:40.691
Brett? Okay. How so?

40:40.691 --> 40:43.277
He was always trying to impress us.

40:43.277 --> 40:46.905
So concerned with what we thought of him

40:46.905 --> 40:51.451
when all we wanted was
for him to care about Zoë.

40:52.327 --> 40:55.289
<i>Ouch! That is not a blessing.</i>

40:55.289 --> 40:56.373
<i>No, it's not.</i>

40:56.373 --> 40:58.125
You're all devils!

40:59.543 --> 41:00.961
I see you.

41:00.961 --> 41:02.421
You're all devils.

41:02.421 --> 41:06.633
You're a devil.

41:06.633 --> 41:09.052
And even that bounding hound of hell--

41:09.052 --> 41:11.221
Okay. That's enough. We're gonna--

41:11.221 --> 41:13.932
- I don't trust him.
- Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Dad. Sorry, everyone.

41:14.808 --> 41:17.728
As you can tell, my beloved
is "in his cups," as they used to say,

41:17.728 --> 41:20.856
so we are going to retire for the evening,

41:20.856 --> 41:23.400
- because he's embarrassing me.
- Pterodactyl who drinks.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.278
We just wanna say, on behalf
of both of us, thank you for being here!

41:26.278 --> 41:28.447
It's the happiest night of our lives, so...

41:29.114 --> 41:32.159
The world will little note
nor long remember what we say here.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.368
Take this child to bed.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.162
Lincoln. Read a book!

41:39.374 --> 41:40.751
That's the best speech of the night.

41:41.919 --> 41:44.171
<i>You think he knew
someone was trying to kill him?</i>

41:44.171 --> 41:46.131
<i>I don't know. He was really drunk.</i>

41:46.131 --> 41:47.841
<i>And then, the next morning...</i>

41:54.556 --> 41:55.807
<i>The end.</i>

41:55.807 --> 41:59.228
<i>Not the end.
I'm gonna help you solve this murder</i>

41:59.228 --> 42:01.730
<i>and get you that blessing.</i>

42:01.730 --> 42:05.484
Really? After everything I told you,
you think that's possible?

42:05.484 --> 42:09.738
<i>You deserve a Hollywood ending.
And I'm gonna get it for you.</i>

42:10.322 --> 42:12.616
<i>But you told this whole story,</i>

42:12.616 --> 42:16.286
<i>and the one person
you barely mentioned at all was the bride.</i>

42:16.828 --> 42:18.747
<i>Who's accused of murder.</i>

42:20.791 --> 42:22.084
Well, it's just--

42:22.751 --> 42:26.839
It's just,
I really don't think Grace did it.

42:26.839 --> 42:28.966
<i>What are you not telling me, Aniq?</i>

42:30.133 --> 42:31.260
Okay, fine.

42:31.844 --> 42:34.304
There are a couple things.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.850
But I just need you to swear
that you won't tell Zoë

42:37.850 --> 42:39.726
or her parents that you heard it from me.

42:39.726 --> 42:40.644
<i>Okay.</i>

42:41.228 --> 42:44.189
<i>So, during the photos,
I saw Grace and Edgar fighting.</i>

42:45.148 --> 42:47.359
<i>Then, in the middle of the first dance...</i>

42:48.235 --> 42:49.319
I have to go.

42:49.319 --> 42:50.654
<i>...Edgar just left.</i>

42:58.370 --> 43:02.833
<i>Then, on my way to the after-party,
I saw Grace outside the library.</i>

43:03.917 --> 43:06.170
<i>And she was putting something in a drink.</i>

43:13.302 --> 43:15.053
<i>And she handed it to Edgar.</i>

43:17.306 --> 43:20.726
<i>Aniq! You saw Grace poison Edgar's drink?</i>

43:20.726 --> 43:22.519
I mean,
I don't know it was poison for sure.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.354
Why is your voice so loud?

43:24.980 --> 43:26.231
Are you in the house?

43:26.231 --> 43:28.942
This is not a house. It's an estate.

43:28.942 --> 43:31.111
And judging by how many stairs I see,

43:31.111 --> 43:33.572
I know they gotta have
at least six bathrooms in here.

43:33.572 --> 43:34.781
Oh, fuck.

43:34.781 --> 43:36.617
What's your name? You fine as hell.

43:36.617 --> 43:37.826
- Sebastian.
- Travis.

43:39.536 --> 43:42.122
Aniq! What did you tell her?

43:42.122 --> 43:43.790
Did you say Grace poisoned him?

43:43.790 --> 43:45.209
All right, everybody.

43:45.209 --> 43:48.170
We got a dead body
and a whole lot of people to talk to,

43:48.170 --> 43:49.671
so let's have some fun.

43:50.297 --> 43:51.798
Got you some nuggets.

43:57.763 --> 43:58.680
Oh, no.
