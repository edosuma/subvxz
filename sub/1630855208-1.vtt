00:09.759 --> 00:11.052
♪ Delta is the one for me! ♪

00:13.054 --> 00:16.599
So I just have a couple
of thoughts regarding

00:16.641 --> 00:21.479
this supposed HBO Max
documentary on Bama Rush.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.232
Okay, you guys, we have
more tea coming through about,

00:24.274 --> 00:26.568
is someone filming
Rush this year?

00:26.609 --> 00:28.486
I have gotten a couple
of reports...

00:28.570 --> 00:30.572
They haven't went up
against this college yet,

00:30.613 --> 00:32.157
and I'm telling you,
you don't want to

00:32.240 --> 00:34.117
go up against
the University of Alabama.

00:34.159 --> 00:37.287
Not to be dramatic,
but this HBO special

00:37.370 --> 00:40.623
could be the end of Greek life
as we know it.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.476
-Hey, y'all.
-Hey, y'all.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.936
Hey, welcome to day one
of Rush week.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.488
We're getting ready to rush.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.657
Like, look at the people
already starting to line up.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.339
Love it!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.345
Is anybody else way too old
and has too many kids

01:35.387 --> 01:38.515
to be this invested in
Bama Rush TikTok?

01:38.556 --> 01:41.059
Like, if Katie
does not get the Delta Zeta bid,

01:41.142 --> 01:42.894
she is going to be devastated.

01:42.977 --> 01:47.065
I've never smoked crystal meth,
but this is how I would imagine

01:47.148 --> 01:51.361
one would feel on
a 72-hour crystal meth binge.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.863
This is officially
becoming a problem.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.991
This is me, two days after
watching Bama Rush Tok.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.206
Bama Rush sisterhood
day one OOTD.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.750
Jewelry is from
Vivienne Westwood, Tiffany.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.043
You know the vibes.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.962
Blouse is from --

02:09.045 --> 02:11.589
We did it. We did it, Joe.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.218
I have been picking my outfits
since January. January.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.429
And my shoes are Dolce Vita.

02:17.512 --> 02:18.930
-These earrings from --
-Amazon.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.142
I think I'm gonna be
different than everyone else.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.227
Wish us luck. Roll Tide.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.688
I'm gonna ask for y'all to
pray for me.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.001
They are doing the Lord's work.

02:48.084 --> 02:49.502
I'm losing it!

02:49.586 --> 02:51.212
Roll Tide.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.105
Hi!

03:42.472 --> 03:44.474
Got my little finger on it,

03:44.557 --> 03:46.351
and I think
it's my acceptance thing,

03:46.434 --> 03:48.728
but I don't really know --
or acceptance or decline

03:48.812 --> 03:50.313
or whatever it is.

03:50.355 --> 03:54.067
Really scared.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.819
I'm shaking really bad.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.954
Pretty emotional day
there when we got that, so...

04:07.247 --> 04:09.958
-Oh!
-Oh, my gosh!

04:13.878 --> 04:16.756
Stops here.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.383
Oh.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.844
Those are all
my Alabama T-shirts,

04:20.885 --> 04:22.971
so the obsession is real.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.556
Gotta love it.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.349
I've had these since, some of
them, like, freshman year.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.518
I'm not even 100%
sure how she found it,

04:28.560 --> 04:31.312
but once she found it,
she was in 100%.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.148
She knew it's where
she wanted to be.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.025
She's our first person
in the family

04:35.108 --> 04:36.735
to do a full four-year college,

04:36.818 --> 04:38.695
so excited for her
for that, too.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.488
I can tell a million people
that I'll be going

04:40.530 --> 04:42.490
to the University of Alabama,
and they'll be like,

04:42.532 --> 04:44.367
"You're totally meant
to go there.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.910
She's so bubbly
and outgoing, like,

04:45.994 --> 04:48.204
she definitely needs to be
in a sorority."

04:48.288 --> 04:49.664
Alabama hair ties.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.332
Three people,
three different people

04:51.374 --> 04:54.878
decided to give me these
for Christmas, 'cause they know.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.467
Probably the part of my life
that I am most proud of

05:00.550 --> 05:02.218
is my adoption story.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.762
So I was adopted
at four days old,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.806
and I started
a nonprofit organization

05:06.890 --> 05:09.893
called Fostering Hope
where I help foster children

05:09.934 --> 05:12.604
and foster families
in the state of Illinois,

05:12.687 --> 05:14.773
and that's something
that I'm super proud of,

05:14.856 --> 05:17.317
but that's just
a little bit about me.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.782
Let's be honest,
I probably would not be going

05:23.865 --> 05:26.951
to the University of Alabama
if it did not blow up on TikTok.

05:27.035 --> 05:31.790
Just because I saw it so much,
so I looked into the school.

05:31.873 --> 05:35.543
Being in a sorority
will kind of help me figure out

05:35.585 --> 05:38.421
who I want to be,
help me be surrounded by people

05:38.505 --> 05:41.675
that will always have my back,
no matter what.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.095
I've always needed a thing
to be a part of, like,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.513
as part of my identity.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.931
It's been really hard
for me to find, like,

05:47.972 --> 05:51.810
a sense of, like, you know,
self-worth

05:51.893 --> 05:54.813
or, like, pride in something
because I feel like

05:54.896 --> 05:57.816
I don't really know
who I am, you know?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.123
Not like this.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.709
I remember doing a tequila shot
with this DILF.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.377
You had a fuckin' hard hat on.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.838
-Ally?
-Yes?

06:19.921 --> 06:22.382
I'm so sorry for
whatever I did last night.

06:22.465 --> 06:25.427
-You actually weren't that bad.
-Was I not?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.345
Okay, I actually
want to be president.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.972
So I'm gonna, like,

06:29.055 --> 06:30.682
work my way up
in the governmental system.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.475
I think I'm gonna be, like,
a governmental lawyer,

06:32.517 --> 06:33.935
like, something on that track.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.146
I'm not, like, 100% sure
what I do to get there yet.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.857
Can you tell us how many jobs
you're working right now?

06:38.940 --> 06:42.444
I work at a nutrition shop,
so, like, Herbalife,

06:42.485 --> 06:44.946
and then I also work
at a tanning salon.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.532
Oh, my therapist also called me
a workaholic.

06:47.615 --> 06:52.287
I was like, "Whatever, girl.
At least I work."

06:52.370 --> 06:54.456
"Hayley --"
or for like, Miss USA,

06:54.497 --> 06:55.832
if I, like, won Miss Alabama,

06:55.915 --> 06:58.877
I'd be like, "Hayley Holliday,
Miss Alabama."

06:58.960 --> 07:01.921
I did pageants
like at 18 months old.

07:02.005 --> 07:06.426
Walking on the stage is the best
feeling in the whole wide world.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.429
I get a high off of winning.

07:13.683 --> 07:17.062
We're walking to our retreat.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.647
Oh, my gosh.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.109
Look at our retreat.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.445
I got into my sorority.
Like, I was living the dream.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.030
This was, like,
everything I've ever wanted.

07:27.072 --> 07:29.866
Like, I was, like, in the
sorority with my, like, sisters

07:29.908 --> 07:31.034
and I had friends,

07:31.076 --> 07:35.121
and then I wore
the wrong sorority sticker

07:35.205 --> 07:36.790
and got dropped.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.001
-For wearing a sticker?
-Yes.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.712
For wearing
another sorority sticker.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.592
Like, I would rather a guy
tell me that I was ugly

07:47.676 --> 07:49.761
than get dropped by a sorority.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.554
I was so humbled.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.140
I thought those people
were my very best friends.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.811
Like, this was my home,
this was where I belonged.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.898
And it does scare me going into,
like, next year's Rush.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.820
-Oh.
-'Sup?

08:06.903 --> 08:09.072
Oh, probably 9:30
would be better.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.115
What time are we waking up?

08:10.198 --> 08:13.410
-Huh?
-I don't know.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.912
I've actually been going to
class this week.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.289
I'm actually in a really good
mood today.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.834
Very rare for me.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.294
I feel like I didn't rush
freshman year

08:23.378 --> 08:27.132
because I need
to find my place here.

08:27.215 --> 08:33.972
When I first moved here, like,
it was just all, like, too much.

08:34.055 --> 08:38.143
But I do regret not rushing.
I did feel really left out.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.146
When did you know you wanted
to be in criminal justice?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.772
Well...

08:42.814 --> 08:44.774
when I was in high school,

08:44.858 --> 08:48.278
I really wanted to be a coroner.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.449
I was very weird.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.784
I got interested
in criminal justice

08:54.826 --> 08:57.787
'cause my dad
was a police officer.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.082
I was 13
when my dad passed away,

09:01.124 --> 09:03.793
so I was in seventh grade.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.880
Yeah.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.925
He would be glad I'm here,
but I don't know about rushing.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.677
He has always wanted to keep me

09:12.761 --> 09:15.972
in a little bubble
and protect me.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.942
Sororities really started along
with co-education.

09:28.026 --> 09:32.614
In 1883, a professor at Harvard

09:32.655 --> 09:35.158
wrote a book called
"Sex in Education."

09:35.241 --> 09:39.204
The basis of his argument
is that if women studied,

09:39.287 --> 09:42.999
then the blood would go to their
brains and not their ovaries,

09:43.041 --> 09:47.337
and that they would shrivel up
and -- and the women would die.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.759
Imagine it's in this environment

09:52.842 --> 09:54.678
that these women
are going to college,

09:54.761 --> 09:57.222
and in the face of that,
they're coming together

09:57.305 --> 09:59.140
to form these early sororities.

09:59.182 --> 10:03.061
The emphasis was very much
on showing that women

10:03.144 --> 10:05.230
could succeed
in higher education.

10:05.313 --> 10:09.859
They were feminists in many ways
before that was a word.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.196
And into the early 1910s,

10:13.279 --> 10:15.824
more and more women
are coming to campus.

10:15.865 --> 10:19.160
The first generation has proven
that they're successful.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.495
In the second generation,

10:20.578 --> 10:23.998
the sororities become
more focused on parties,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.876
on socializing,
and on showing that they are

10:26.960 --> 10:31.923
the best representatives
of true womanhood on campus.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.050
The whole notion of Rush came

10:34.092 --> 10:38.221
because they were rushing
to show themselves

10:38.263 --> 10:42.225
as the best sororities on campus
to attract the best members.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.562
They would meet the trains
that the new students

10:45.645 --> 10:47.439
were taking to get to campus,

10:47.522 --> 10:52.736
literally whisking them off
and trying to woo and win over

10:52.777 --> 10:56.072
the best members
of the new class.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.077
So this is my Rush binder,
because I have OCD,

11:01.119 --> 11:03.621
so it's just going to be
organized by each sorority,

11:03.705 --> 11:04.998
with each recruitment letter,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.417
and then I'm probably
gonna have a mock-up

11:07.459 --> 11:09.502
of my recruitment letter of
how I'll send it out

11:09.586 --> 11:11.087
to each person in here as well.

11:11.129 --> 11:15.258
I'm definitely going to do
Google slides of my outfits,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.345
and I'm gonna have them
pre-planned and packed

11:18.428 --> 11:19.888
in a separate bag,

11:19.971 --> 11:21.806
so that way, if I still need
to unpack some stuff

11:21.890 --> 11:24.476
after my parents leave
or while I'm rushing,

11:24.559 --> 11:26.770
like, at night time,
I can unpack that,

11:26.811 --> 11:29.522
but I want to have all
my Rush stuff ready to go.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.650
When did you know you wanted
to be in a sorority at Alabama?

11:32.734 --> 11:35.278
Yes, so I started watching
Gracie O'Connor,

11:35.320 --> 11:36.571
who's on YouTube.

11:36.613 --> 11:37.947
It made me want
to go there even more.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.033
She was like,
so adorable and fun,

11:40.116 --> 11:42.077
and I was like,
that looks like so much fun

11:42.160 --> 11:43.078
and I want that.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.830
Here it is.
It's my final look.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.625
Got this super cute
tassel earrings,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.543
bracelets, and the necklace.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.170
When Bama Rush Tok blew up,

11:52.253 --> 11:54.130
you know, I had plenty
of people commenting,

11:54.172 --> 11:56.174
"Don't forget the OG,
Gracie O'Connor."

11:56.257 --> 11:58.301
And I'm like, me?

12:01.638 --> 12:03.056
At the University of Alabama,

12:03.139 --> 12:06.101
Rush consists of four
highly competitive rounds

12:06.142 --> 12:08.186
that give sororities
and potential new members

12:08.269 --> 12:10.355
the chance to make
the best possible impression

12:10.438 --> 12:11.606
on one another.

12:11.648 --> 12:12.899
And during these rounds,

12:12.982 --> 12:14.859
the sororities vote
on their top PNMs,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.070
and the PNMs vote
on their top sororities.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.947
They're trying to find
the perfect match.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.702
Basically what happens
is there's multiple girls

12:23.785 --> 12:25.662
that gets to talk to one PNM.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.164
That amount of girls
will get to vote on her.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.960
If she gets high enough votes
or if we like her,

12:32.043 --> 12:34.087
then she'll come back.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.755
Over the course of the week,

12:35.839 --> 12:38.717
the girls return to
fewer and fewer sororities,

12:38.800 --> 12:40.593
whether they were dropped
or chose to drop

12:40.677 --> 12:42.887
certain sororities
along the way.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.681
Active members are
looking for girls

12:44.723 --> 12:46.266
that we can see futures in

12:46.349 --> 12:49.185
and that are going to, like,
literally uphold our chapter

12:49.269 --> 12:51.563
and make us better
in all aspects,

12:51.646 --> 12:53.690
whether that be grades or, like,

12:53.773 --> 12:56.985
how we present ourselves
to the universe.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.029
If you're not meeting
a certain criteria,

12:59.070 --> 13:02.365
you'll kind of just be dropped.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.910
After the final round,
PNMs choose their top sorority

13:05.994 --> 13:08.872
and the sororities select
their new pledge class.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.874
It comes down to, like,
crunch time, and no one wants

13:10.957 --> 13:13.001
to make any decisions
on anybody's girl,

13:13.084 --> 13:14.461
but someone has to.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.421
And so we're just, like,
crying through the process.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.423
Like, it's never easy.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.716
That part sucks.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.471
It's way more dramatic
than you're thinking it is.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.222
Like, it's way...

13:26.306 --> 13:28.516
And I'm not going to tell you
how hard it is.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.185
I'm so sorry. I can't.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.062
This all leads up to Bid Day.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.397
The PNMs meet at
Bryant-Denny Stadium

13:34.481 --> 13:36.900
and open envelopes containing
the name of the sorority

13:36.983 --> 13:38.234
that they've been
invited to join,

13:38.318 --> 13:40.278
and hopefully,
it's their top choice.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.364
After the PNMs
open their invitations,

13:42.405 --> 13:44.240
they run back
to their forever home

13:44.282 --> 13:46.534
with the new sisters
in their pledge class.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.955
Rush has gotten so competitive
over the past decade

13:51.039 --> 13:53.416
that I really saw a need
for our services

13:53.458 --> 13:57.045
and what we do to help
prepare girls to go through Rush

13:57.128 --> 14:00.465
and hopefully get them
into the house of their dreams.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.219
I remember when we were going
through recruitment at Georgia,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.846
we would all be looking
at what Alabama was doing.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.099
Yeah, they're just
the trend setters.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.892
And I think that's why so many
out-of-state girls

14:10.934 --> 14:13.144
decide to go to the
University of Alabama and Rush.

14:13.228 --> 14:18.066
It's just this beast,
because Greek life is

14:18.149 --> 14:20.151
everything at Alabama.

14:20.235 --> 14:24.114
The University of Alabama
is the top sorority recruitment

14:24.197 --> 14:26.616
in all of the country,
and it's a huge school

14:26.658 --> 14:28.159
with tons of money
rolling into it

14:28.243 --> 14:29.953
for their football program.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.955
The girls are, like,
glammed to the gods.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.791
It sucks you in.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.085
Rush at
the University of Alabama

14:37.168 --> 14:39.671
traditionally
has kind of a bad rap.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.965
It's kind of
a cutthroat process.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.343
It's just uniquely,
uniquely Alabama,

14:45.427 --> 14:48.304
which doesn't really make
much sense, but...

14:50.473 --> 14:53.685
I'm still holding out
that we're gonna be able

14:53.768 --> 14:54.978
to get into those houses.

14:55.020 --> 14:55.979
What do you think?

14:56.021 --> 14:58.314
Oh. Probably not.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.651
Getting inside those houses
is like, absolutely not.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.362
They're very protective of it,
and rightfully so,

15:04.446 --> 15:08.783
because of the misconceptions
that people want to expose,

15:08.825 --> 15:10.493
like, these sorority secrets.

15:12.996 --> 15:15.123
Hey, who are you filming for?

15:15.165 --> 15:18.710
Okay, ma'am, I'm going to have
to ask you to, like, leave.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.175
Tell me more about
what you hope

15:25.216 --> 15:27.510
to get out of
being in a sorority?

15:27.594 --> 15:31.014
I've had a really hard time
finding someone

15:31.056 --> 15:33.016
that can love me
no matter what.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.393
I have, like, my friends
from school who love

15:35.477 --> 15:39.147
the, like, crazy fun,
sneaking into school at midnight

15:39.189 --> 15:41.566
and jumping in the pool
kind of girl.

15:41.649 --> 15:46.321
And then there's my family,
who loves the sweet and caring

15:46.363 --> 15:49.199
and, you know,
really involved person.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.495
And I feel like no one knows
me fully and loves me fully,

15:53.536 --> 15:55.830
and I feel like
that's really something

15:55.872 --> 15:57.707
I want with these girls.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.769
You know what? Let's just go.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.108
Weird?
Why you being weird to me?

17:05.191 --> 17:07.027
You said you
wanted to get married.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.611
"When I say that?"

17:08.695 --> 17:12.157
♪ When you had the leg up,
up, up, up ♪

17:12.240 --> 17:13.783
I have a serious question
for, like, everyone,

17:13.867 --> 17:15.452
and everyone has to answer this.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.287
If you were a fruit, what kind
of fruit would you be and why?

17:17.328 --> 17:19.164
I would be a strawberry.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.457
-Why a strawberry?
-I don't know.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.959
I just -- everybody
loves strawberries

17:23.043 --> 17:24.419
and I just, like,
want to be loved

17:24.502 --> 17:26.504
by everybody, because
I low-key, like, see --

17:26.588 --> 17:29.758
Like, I don't like
when people don't like me.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.468
Makayla, what about you?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.720
A watermelon.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.221
Why?

17:35.305 --> 17:38.141
Because I act hard
on the outside,

17:38.183 --> 17:40.977
but I'm soft on the inside.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.355
Aww.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.025
'Cause, I mean,
I moved out at 16, so...

17:47.108 --> 17:49.027
as soon as my dad died, I...

17:49.110 --> 17:50.320
...hit the hay.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.489
I think that's why
we also bond, too,

17:52.530 --> 17:54.366
because we're missing our dads.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.869
Trauma bond!

18:02.665 --> 18:06.336
This hill!

18:06.419 --> 18:07.504
Dang!

18:07.545 --> 18:10.590
There's some fresh bodies
over here.

18:10.674 --> 18:14.177
Why are we seeing
my dad's grave on Halloween?

18:14.219 --> 18:16.054
Why?

18:16.137 --> 18:20.183
Oh, my gosh.
Your dad's grave is so pretty.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.186
My dad loved his job so much.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.398
Everyone talks about
how he was the best police.

18:26.481 --> 18:29.567
My dad would even give
my mom tickets.

18:29.651 --> 18:33.029
He was serious about the ticket.
He liked to mess with her a lot.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.156
My dad was such a jokester.

18:35.198 --> 18:41.496
Like, yeah, so he was,
like...I don't know.

18:42.872 --> 18:46.668
It just is exhausting
having to hold everything in.

18:46.710 --> 18:50.213
-You don't have to.
-That's how I was raised.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.548
I know.
I was raised the same way.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.174
But me and Abby are
always here for you.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.343
Yeah.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.638
I'm just a very,
like, to myself person

18:58.722 --> 19:00.557
about this kind of stuff.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.310
Whoo! Whoo!

20:14.297 --> 20:15.674
Hey, y'all.

20:15.757 --> 20:19.427
Alabama recruitment day three,
outfit of the day.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.971
Shirt is a personal gift
from Jeff Bezos.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.725
Jeans are from an internment
camp in San Francisco.

20:25.809 --> 20:30.021
Earrings are a gift from my
grandma from beyond the grave.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.816
Bracelets are from Applebee's
and shoes are from Target.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.151
You know, something
that's ingrained in us

20:35.193 --> 20:38.154
early on is that,
yeah, you're a person,

20:38.196 --> 20:39.656
but you're a Sigma Kappa first.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.242
You're a woman, but you're
a Sigma Kappa woman first,

20:42.325 --> 20:45.161
and that's a lot of what being
in a sorority is.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.538
It's branding.

20:46.621 --> 20:48.707
That's, you know,
every single Greek organization.

20:48.790 --> 20:51.167
That's kind of one of the things
that we sign on to

20:51.251 --> 20:52.919
when we join one.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.518
♪ ...for a roll call ♪

21:08.560 --> 21:10.520
♪ Queens of the Row, check ♪

21:10.562 --> 21:12.188
♪ Good grades on exams, check ♪

21:12.230 --> 21:13.690

21:13.773 --> 21:15.358

21:15.400 --> 21:17.444
Should I put on lip gloss?

21:17.527 --> 21:18.945
-Yeah.
-Okay, ready?

21:19.029 --> 21:21.114
-Does it look bad on camera?
-No, it looks pretty.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.159
Oh, no, I lost my pen.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.869
With social media,
with recruitment,

21:25.952 --> 21:29.748
people, like, literally look
at you like you are in college

21:29.831 --> 21:32.792
majoring in sorority,
almost like a little doll

21:32.876 --> 21:35.378
in your fake
University of Alabama world

21:35.462 --> 21:37.630
in your little sorority
doing your,

21:37.714 --> 21:39.341
you know, tiny little tasks.

21:39.382 --> 21:42.052
Everyone's putting
their best out on social media.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.511
I'm not going to post that,

21:43.553 --> 21:45.764
"Oh, I -- You know,
I got a C on my chem test,

21:45.847 --> 21:47.807
even though I studied
for 12 hours.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.225
Boo."

21:49.309 --> 21:50.560
Should we hang it
over the balcony right here?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.395
-That's I was thinking.
-That's funny.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.647
Like this.
Yeah, look at her.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.608
Three...
I can't see the phone.

21:56.691 --> 21:59.569
-Oh.
-I lost something once.

21:59.611 --> 22:01.863
That's good. That's so funny.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.407
I lost something once.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.243
-It's so perfect!
-I lost my pen.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.245
People assume what
you're gonna be like

22:09.287 --> 22:11.081
as a woman in a sorority.
Yeah.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.248
"Oh, why are you trying so hard?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.875
Like, you should
just get a husband."

22:13.917 --> 22:17.420
I'm not only a sorority girl.
I'm a woman in a sorority.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.880
-Yeah.
-And it's not the same thing.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.715
Honestly, what makes me mad
is that in our sorority,

22:20.757 --> 22:23.635
like, we're so understanding,
and it's the people that,

22:23.718 --> 22:25.637
like, hate on us,
and they stereotype us --

22:25.720 --> 22:27.764
I'm like,
y'all are the mean ones, not us.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.808
Like, we don't do anything.
What do we do?

22:29.891 --> 22:33.353
Sit there and eat
our chicken sandwiches together?

22:33.436 --> 22:34.813
Like, what?
We don't do anything.

22:34.896 --> 22:36.981
We put a lot --
a lot of pressure on ourselves.

22:37.065 --> 22:40.235
Example, right here
of my sweet little girls.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.736
-Are you editing us?
-Yep.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.571
So, like, let's just say...
Let me look at that.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.448
...we want to make
Lauren's arm smaller.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.950
We can go like this.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.410
We can make it smaller,
we can make it smaller.

22:48.451 --> 22:49.828
Let's whiten her teeth
a little bit.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.622
And then let's make
Kaiya's head big for fun,

22:52.706 --> 22:54.416
just so you guys can see.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.792
Like, just so you can see.
You want to do me dirty?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.336
-Like, a child could do this.
-It's so easy.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.796
If you want to make
your waist thinner

22:59.879 --> 23:01.840
to make yourself feel better
about posting it online,

23:01.923 --> 23:03.717
I understand,
but the problem is,

23:03.800 --> 23:06.469
is that these women with
millions of followers...

23:06.553 --> 23:07.554
14-year-old girls are gonna
look at that and be like,

23:07.637 --> 23:08.930
"Why don't I look that way?"

23:08.972 --> 23:10.598
...post that and act like
it's real.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.100
The things that I say to myself
and think to myself

23:12.183 --> 23:14.644
about my body, I would never say
that to someone else.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.438
You know, when you're living
with other women

23:16.479 --> 23:18.606
and, like, you're around
other women all the time

23:18.648 --> 23:21.776
that, you know, I think
are very beautiful girls...

23:21.818 --> 23:25.989
You know, I would kill to
look like any of my friends.

23:26.072 --> 23:29.325
You know, it's hard to be like,
"That's okay

23:29.367 --> 23:30.660
that I don't look like them."

23:30.744 --> 23:33.538
Everyone has, like,
their important qualities

23:33.621 --> 23:34.914
that aren't affected

23:34.998 --> 23:37.625
by how prettier
you think your friends are

23:37.667 --> 23:40.503
or, like, how you want your hair
to look like her hair.

23:40.545 --> 23:42.005
It doesn't change who you are

23:42.047 --> 23:46.968
and who -- like, what people
really value you for.

23:47.010 --> 23:50.096
Okay, great. So there's just
a few more questions

23:50.180 --> 23:51.681
and we can, like, go through.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.892
Well, interim question that
has nothing to do with this,

23:53.975 --> 23:56.269
but just out of curiosity...
Yes?

23:56.353 --> 23:59.022
Nobody in my family is even,

23:59.064 --> 24:01.733
like, bald from just
being an older man.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.443
Do you put sunscreen
on your head?

24:03.526 --> 24:04.778
-Yes!
-Yes, right?

24:04.861 --> 24:06.613
That's what I thought. Yeah.
So much.

24:06.696 --> 24:09.032
So much, because, like,

24:09.074 --> 24:12.035
I could never get
skin cancer on my head.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.371
-Yeah, what would you do?
-This is my whole thing.

24:14.454 --> 24:17.248
Right. That's terrible.

24:17.332 --> 24:19.209
It's actually
stressful at the beach.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.418
I can... Right?

24:20.502 --> 24:21.920
You must have to do a hat,
right?

24:22.003 --> 24:24.798
With summer, yeah,
I do hats and I do turbans.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.883
Mm-hmm.

24:28.218 --> 24:32.681
Okay, I think I know where
I'm going with this.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.934
Between Katie,
this smart, beautiful girl,

24:36.017 --> 24:39.604
telling me that she wishes
she looked like her friends

24:39.688 --> 24:42.899
or she compares herself
to other women

24:42.941 --> 24:47.153
and the endless scrolling
of these OOTDs,

24:47.237 --> 24:48.947
it hit me.

24:50.782 --> 24:54.411
I feel like I rushed, too.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.871
And just stay with me on this --

24:56.913 --> 25:00.917
in these OOTDs, these girls
are showing us their earrings,

25:00.959 --> 25:04.671
their necklaces, their outfits
that they put on

25:04.754 --> 25:08.591
to look like
they belong in a sorority.

25:08.633 --> 25:13.430
And I feel like I rushed
because I have alopecia

25:13.513 --> 25:16.850
and I wore a wig for 14 years.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.102
I wore a different wig
every year.

25:19.144 --> 25:22.939
I wore a mullet, a bowl cut,
a blunt cut, a body wave,

25:23.023 --> 25:25.608
a perm --
I wore a layered look.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.402
My Rush looked different.

25:27.444 --> 25:32.073
I was trying to get into
the sorority of

25:32.115 --> 25:34.951
all of the girls
in the world who have hair,

25:34.993 --> 25:39.039
and it felt like an impossible
sorority to get into.

25:39.122 --> 25:42.625
I was going to compete
for my position,

25:42.667 --> 25:44.252
and my wig was a secret.

25:44.294 --> 25:46.838
If you found out
that I wore a wig,

25:46.921 --> 25:50.967
if you even questioned
that I wore a wig,

25:51.051 --> 25:54.304
it would shatter me.

25:54.346 --> 25:59.059
So I know it's not exactly like
the Alabama Rush,

25:59.142 --> 26:02.562
but it's like,
not that different.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.732
I think the competition
mostly comes from

26:05.815 --> 26:07.817
the rankings of sororities,

26:07.859 --> 26:10.820
trying to get in one of those
top or middle-tier houses

26:10.862 --> 26:14.074
and not getting into
a bottom house.

26:14.157 --> 26:17.577
I visited the
University of Alabama,

26:17.660 --> 26:21.623
observing
the sorority Rush parties.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.167
I probably saw
five or six houses.

26:24.209 --> 26:29.172
Rush is a social
stratification ritual bar none.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.715
Stratification in the sense

26:30.799 --> 26:35.095
of organizing people
and groups of people

26:35.178 --> 26:41.935
into tiers of power,
of status, of prestige.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.813
It's a proving ground
of competitive femininity

26:44.854 --> 26:49.234
and the contemporary performance
of the Southern belle.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.235
-Hey, y'all.
-Hey, y'all.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.653
Hey, y'all.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.987
Do you think I would get
into a top-tier house?

26:53.029 --> 26:54.489
You wouldn't get in
with those shoes.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.408
You got to have cute shoes.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.286
Who determines the rankings?

27:00.370 --> 27:04.374
I have no idea, to be honest.

27:04.416 --> 27:07.335
Actually, I'm going to give you
my potential thoughts on it.

27:07.377 --> 27:10.755
I think a lot of the times
people like to rank --

27:10.839 --> 27:13.842
and by people,
I usually mean fraternity boys

27:13.883 --> 27:15.677
or boys in general,
I feel like they're like,

27:15.719 --> 27:17.846
"Oh, this house
has the hottest girls,

27:17.929 --> 27:19.222
so they're a top house."

27:19.305 --> 27:21.725
Like, "These freshmen
are the hottest freshmen,

27:21.808 --> 27:23.476
so they're going to be
considered a top house."

27:30.233 --> 27:32.235
The potential new members
are trying to get in,

27:32.318 --> 27:34.529
but also, these sororities
are trying to get,

27:34.571 --> 27:35.864
like, the best girls.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.615
-For sure.
-What does that even mean?

27:37.699 --> 27:39.951
Yeah, so, the ranking system,

27:40.035 --> 27:42.996
I truly believe it's based
on the fraternities.

27:44.789 --> 27:46.750
So essentially,
they have a social calendar,

27:46.791 --> 27:48.460
and they get to mix
with certain sororities,

27:48.543 --> 27:51.212
but it's only a limited amount,
and the fraternities want to be

27:51.254 --> 27:53.923
mixing with the hottest
sororities, of course,

27:53.965 --> 27:56.051
'cause, you know,
they're 20-year-old males.

27:56.092 --> 27:59.262
So that's kind of where
the ranking system comes from.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.973
They want to make sure the girls
who are wearing their letters

28:02.057 --> 28:04.934
are up to their standards.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.699
The hierarchy of sororities
that exist here

28:19.783 --> 28:21.993
really determines
how your experience

28:22.077 --> 28:24.662
in the Greek system
is going to be.

28:24.746 --> 28:28.124
There are a lot of things
that you're entitled to

28:28.208 --> 28:30.377
when you're
in a top-tier sorority.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.795
You're entitled to test banks

28:31.836 --> 28:33.588
that are going to help you
on your exams.

28:33.630 --> 28:36.049
You're entitled to people
in your sorority

28:36.132 --> 28:37.926
that have better connections,

28:37.967 --> 28:40.845
whether their parents
are richer or more connected.

28:40.929 --> 28:44.474
You're entitled to a male gaze

28:44.516 --> 28:47.769
that might be a little bit
more beneficial to you.

28:47.811 --> 28:50.313
And so, you know,
being in a bottom-tier sorority,

28:50.397 --> 28:53.942
I have to understand that
at some point, there's nothing

28:54.025 --> 28:57.987
that I can do to change
institutionalized rankings.

28:58.029 --> 29:01.908
You know, Sigma Kappa,
we've done all the right things,

29:01.991 --> 29:04.494
but we'll never be
anything but bottom tier

29:04.536 --> 29:07.080
for at least
the next 20, 30 years,

29:07.163 --> 29:10.709
because that's just
how it works here.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.836
You guys,
as far as we have heard,

29:12.877 --> 29:15.839
are considered
like, a top-tier sorority.

29:15.922 --> 29:17.382
-I --
-I mean, I'm not going to lie.

29:17.465 --> 29:19.217
Like, whenever I tell someone
what sorority I'm in,

29:19.300 --> 29:20.719
and they're like, "Oh, wow,"
that's flattering.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.137
I think it's hard.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.347
We kind of have to tiptoe
around this question,

29:24.431 --> 29:29.853
because we would be naive
to deny that lots of people

29:29.936 --> 29:33.106
recognize us as a top tier --
"top tier" house.

29:33.189 --> 29:35.608
But do I think there are
other great sororities?

29:35.692 --> 29:37.485
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

29:53.043 --> 29:57.714
So this is basically
the Shelby Taj Mahal.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.049
That's what my family calls it.

29:59.090 --> 30:02.344
But these are awards
from dance competitions.

30:02.385 --> 30:06.139
I volunteer with children with
special needs and we race,

30:06.222 --> 30:09.059
and the girl that I raced with
got first place.

30:09.142 --> 30:12.395
Look, I got the Super Style
award in fifth grade.

30:12.437 --> 30:17.150
I think Rush is a week-long
adrenaline rush like no other.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.361
The Olympics, that's what
we should call it from now on.

30:19.402 --> 30:23.073
I definitely think it's a sport.
Definitely.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.449
So this is my pageant binder.

30:24.532 --> 30:27.202
This is my life
when I competed in pageants,

30:27.285 --> 30:28.953
so it's kind of
why I wanted to do

30:29.037 --> 30:31.414
the sorority Rush binder
for myself.

30:31.498 --> 30:36.169
I will have kind of the similar
things in here for Rush.

30:36.252 --> 30:39.839
I'll definitely have
a motivation tab of just

30:39.923 --> 30:42.342
a ton of quotes
and stuff for me to look at.

30:42.425 --> 30:45.720
I like the paper copy because
I like to be able to feel it

30:45.762 --> 30:47.806
and really look at it,

30:47.889 --> 30:49.224
'cause sometimes
when you're in the moment

30:49.265 --> 30:50.767
and you're stressed out
and you're worried,

30:50.850 --> 30:54.437
you forget all the things
that you've been taught.

30:54.521 --> 30:58.441
I feel like I fit in perfectly
with the way that they dress --

30:58.525 --> 31:00.318
not because I've chosen
to be that way,

31:00.402 --> 31:03.613
but just because, like,
that's who I am.

31:03.697 --> 31:08.952
I don't think you want to wear
anything that's too scandalous,

31:09.035 --> 31:10.787
or as we call it, scandy.

31:10.829 --> 31:14.124
You don't want to, like, have
a bad reputation for yourself.

31:14.165 --> 31:16.710
You want to keep it
the three C's --

31:16.793 --> 31:19.254
classy, calm, and cool.

31:21.256 --> 31:25.969
The biggest thing is that,
because it started so early on,

31:26.011 --> 31:28.847
like, maybe 1800s -- 1898.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.433
Zeta Tau Alpha
was established in 1898.

31:31.516 --> 31:33.059
There's kind of like

31:33.143 --> 31:37.105
those really old-timey,
strict rules

31:37.147 --> 31:38.481
of what the group is.

31:38.523 --> 31:40.483
You have a lot of rules
you have to follow,

31:40.567 --> 31:42.152
which, some of them
I really agree with.

31:42.193 --> 31:43.445
Some of them are like,

31:43.486 --> 31:45.196
"Oh, are you kidding me
right now?"

31:45.280 --> 31:47.490
We are not allowed to drink
in our letters whatsoever.

31:47.574 --> 31:49.159
I don't think in any of
the sorority houses,

31:49.242 --> 31:50.994
you can have alcohol.
Why is that, do you know?

31:51.036 --> 31:52.245
It must be a Panhellenic rule,

31:52.328 --> 31:54.497
because fraternities are
always allowed,

31:54.581 --> 31:57.500
and the amount of alcohol
in that house is disgusting.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.296
Another rule that I just
thought was really dumb --

32:01.338 --> 32:05.133
no wet hair in the house
on the first floor.

32:05.175 --> 32:06.343
I know there was one house

32:06.426 --> 32:08.261
that my roommate
was in freshman year.

32:08.345 --> 32:11.222
She told me that they literally
could not leave the dorm

32:11.306 --> 32:13.058
unless they had two
out of three done,

32:13.141 --> 32:15.060
which was either you had to
have your hair done,

32:15.143 --> 32:17.854
makeup done, or outfit on.

32:17.896 --> 32:20.899
All it takes is one person
to know what chapter you're in

32:20.982 --> 32:22.150
and like,
to reach out to somebody,

32:22.192 --> 32:24.444
and you can be
in trouble the next day.

32:27.405 --> 32:29.366
Like, as far as our rules,
we have just

32:29.407 --> 32:31.993
the longest COC
in the entire universe,

32:32.035 --> 32:33.286
our code of conduct.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.372
The ones I usually
get in trouble for

32:35.413 --> 32:37.832
are like,
disrespecting a sister,

32:37.916 --> 32:39.709
which is such
a subjective thing,

32:39.793 --> 32:41.211
and really makes
our standards process

32:41.252 --> 32:42.879
kind of a joke sometimes.

32:42.921 --> 32:45.298
So essentially, what happens is
you go to the standards meeting.

32:45.382 --> 32:47.217
There are six girls
that like to play judge

32:47.258 --> 32:50.095
and they like to reiterate that

32:50.178 --> 32:51.930
you're innocent
until proven guilty,

32:52.013 --> 32:53.640
but you're -- you're guilty

32:53.723 --> 32:55.266
until you prove yourself
innocent.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.811
Is that my standards?

32:57.894 --> 32:59.896
"Specify the issue or concern."

32:59.979 --> 33:01.189
"Member had a video of her

33:01.231 --> 33:02.649
wearing her Sigma Kappa
letters" --

33:02.732 --> 33:03.858
misspelled.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.318
"The video seemed to put
Sigma Kappa

33:05.402 --> 33:07.529
and Greek life in
a negative light."

33:07.612 --> 33:08.988
And since coming here,

33:09.072 --> 33:11.449
I've changed in ways
that I don't fucking like.

33:11.533 --> 33:12.617
Roll Tide, though.

33:12.701 --> 33:16.037
Did I lie? Did I lie? Did I lie?
I didn't lie.

33:16.079 --> 33:17.914
I wasn't talking shit
about Sigma Kappa

33:17.997 --> 33:20.125
or like, the Greek life.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.502
I was saying that, like,
the culture at Alabama

33:22.585 --> 33:23.545
is fucking weird.

33:23.586 --> 33:26.631
And you know what? It is.
So die mad.

33:26.715 --> 33:28.466
♪ This is my ministry,
lightweight-type chemistry ♪

33:28.550 --> 33:30.427
♪ Going to Italy,
like it, you feeling me? ♪

33:30.510 --> 33:32.595
♪ Playing with my racks,
a nigga attacks ♪

33:34.597 --> 33:36.433
♪ Playing with my racks,

33:36.516 --> 33:38.143
♪ Fuck with me crucially,
you catchin' disa ♪

33:38.226 --> 33:39.602
Are you serious?

33:39.686 --> 33:43.565
They're literally wearing
someone else's sticker.

33:43.606 --> 33:48.111
And I got in trouble
for wearing another sticker?

33:48.194 --> 33:50.572
Are you kidding me right now?

33:52.490 --> 33:55.535
I just felt like they were
looking for a reason to drop me.

33:55.618 --> 33:58.163
Other girls went upstairs
in fraternity houses.

33:58.246 --> 34:01.249
Other girls slept
at fraternity houses,

34:01.291 --> 34:03.960
and they're still
in the sorority.

34:06.463 --> 34:09.716
I know who tattled on me.
I'm not going to say.

34:09.799 --> 34:11.634
And it's fine, like, you know,
I just wish nothing

34:11.718 --> 34:13.720
but happiness for her
and I hope she's having, like,

34:13.803 --> 34:17.640
the best life in DZ as she can.

34:33.031 --> 34:36.951
I've been meeting every week
with a sorority consultant.

34:36.993 --> 34:39.829
Her name's Sloan,
and she's the best.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.122
I love her, and I feel like

34:41.164 --> 34:44.626
I would be
absolutely lost without her.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.212
You have to remember
who's recruiting you --

34:47.295 --> 34:50.173
19-year-olds, 20-year-olds,
and 21-year-olds.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.675
-Yeah.
-Do they...

34:51.758 --> 34:54.302
Are they looking for you
to talk about a specific topic?

34:54.344 --> 34:56.846
No. No, they're not.
Yeah.

34:56.888 --> 34:58.348
So what
they are looking for you

34:58.431 --> 35:00.725
is just to stay away
from five topics.

35:00.809 --> 35:02.560
And they're called
the five B's, and that --

35:02.644 --> 35:04.312
I don't know who
came up with that,

35:04.354 --> 35:06.022
but it's just a great way
for you to, like,

35:06.106 --> 35:07.357
kind of remember.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.358
So, Boys.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.984
It just means fraternity boys

35:10.026 --> 35:12.737
and talking about like, swaps
or mixers or anything like that.

35:12.821 --> 35:15.448
But if they bring it up,
it's okay to talk about it,

35:15.532 --> 35:18.034
just you don't want to, like,
initiate that conversation

35:18.118 --> 35:20.578
and be like, "What fraternities
do you guys hang out with?"

35:20.662 --> 35:23.456
The next one is Booze.
Just don't talk about alcohol.

35:23.540 --> 35:24.749
Bible.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.335
All they mean is like,
asking about their religion,

35:27.377 --> 35:29.337
what church they go to
or anything like that

35:29.379 --> 35:30.880
puts someone in a corner.

35:30.964 --> 35:33.717
The next one is Bucks,
so, money.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.511
So you don't want to be like,
"Does your dad own a yacht

35:36.553 --> 35:39.389
off of the South of France?"
or anything like that.

35:39.472 --> 35:41.766
Or you don't want to bring
that stuff up as well.

35:41.850 --> 35:45.353
And the last one is Biden
is what they're probably

35:45.395 --> 35:47.397
referring to now,
and all it means is, politics.

35:47.480 --> 35:50.233
And again, you're more than
welcome to talk about diversity

35:50.316 --> 35:52.485
and Black Lives Matter
and if you're, you know,

35:52.569 --> 35:54.446
a political science major
or anything like that,

35:54.529 --> 35:56.865
going to law school,
Elle Woods, whatever.

35:56.906 --> 35:59.492
But you just don't want
to ask them specific questions

35:59.576 --> 36:01.578
about their
political affiliation.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.955
So, "What are your thoughts
on inflation?

36:04.039 --> 36:05.498
What are your thoughts on Biden?

36:05.582 --> 36:07.417
Do you think Donald Trump
should have won the election?"

36:07.459 --> 36:11.129
It just puts people in a corner
and it makes them uncomfortable.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.922
-Yeah.
-That's all it is.

36:15.759 --> 36:18.511
So my experience
was pretty typical,

36:18.595 --> 36:20.388
and I definitely had
my ups and downs.

36:20.430 --> 36:23.475
I got dropped by a sorority
I loved on Pref,

36:23.558 --> 36:25.268
and I was really devastated.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.770
I was literally crying

36:26.811 --> 36:30.440
in the Miller Learning Center
at Georgia,

36:30.523 --> 36:32.776
and I wiped the mascara
from under my eyes and said,

36:32.859 --> 36:34.778
okay, I'm going to give these
two sororities one more chance,

36:34.861 --> 36:38.073
and Pref completely changed
my mind on the sorority

36:38.156 --> 36:39.532
I ended up joining.

36:39.616 --> 36:43.286
I met this incredible woman,
and she was just so fun.

36:43.370 --> 36:45.330
Like, it was the first time
during sorority recruitment

36:45.413 --> 36:46.790
where I didn't put pressure
on myself

36:46.831 --> 36:49.084
and I was just able to open up
and talk to her

36:49.167 --> 36:50.335
and she was so fun.

36:50.418 --> 36:51.836
Luckily, they liked me enough

36:51.920 --> 36:54.714
to make sure
that I was on the Bid Day list.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.883
What's giving me anxiety
is my anxiety,

36:56.966 --> 36:58.343
'cause I'm like, what if I,
like, break down?

36:58.426 --> 36:59.678
Like,
what if I have a panic attack?

36:59.761 --> 37:02.013
What if I start
to get really nervous

37:02.097 --> 37:03.390
or I mess something up

37:03.473 --> 37:05.809
and, like, it causes me to,
like, totally,

37:05.850 --> 37:07.268
you know, spiral?

37:07.310 --> 37:10.355
So I'm on medication and stuff,
but just,

37:10.438 --> 37:13.983
do you have any tips to make me,
like, less anxious?

37:14.067 --> 37:16.653
And I think the main thing
that will cause like, anxiety

37:16.695 --> 37:19.614
is if like, I think I messed up
or if I say the wrong thing

37:19.656 --> 37:21.950
and I get really like...
you know, just, like, nervous

37:22.033 --> 37:23.660
and have a panic attack.

37:23.702 --> 37:26.454
Do you have any, like, tips
on how to, like, not freak out?

37:26.496 --> 37:29.374
Great question.
So we'll have a ton of practice.

37:29.457 --> 37:31.459
-Okay.
-We'll figure out your answers

37:31.501 --> 37:33.044
and practice your conversations,

37:33.128 --> 37:34.629
so you will be
hitting your points.

37:34.671 --> 37:35.880
-Yeah.
-Good.

37:35.964 --> 37:37.465
But also, the members
are there to reassure you.

37:37.507 --> 37:38.842
You'll know if you had
a good conversation.

37:38.925 --> 37:41.803
-Uh-huh. Yeah.
-Also, I'm a phone call away.

37:46.683 --> 37:49.894
I have always been, like,
an anxious person.

37:49.978 --> 37:51.354
I would be so anxious

37:51.438 --> 37:54.607
that I would cry myself
to sleep every night.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.651
I always kind of struggled,
like, with my body

37:56.735 --> 37:58.153
and, like,
with feeling confident.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.696
These girls would make fun of me

37:59.738 --> 38:01.781
every single day
in the locker room,

38:01.865 --> 38:05.535
like, about my body and make
comments while I'm changing,

38:05.618 --> 38:07.704
you know,
comments about, like,

38:07.746 --> 38:10.665
not eating, like, I shouldn't
eat or if I, you know --

38:10.707 --> 38:13.585
wear this, then I look fat,
or stuff like that.

38:13.668 --> 38:15.712
And it sent me

38:15.754 --> 38:18.256
into a really bad relationship
with food.

38:18.340 --> 38:19.632
So for like a full year,

38:19.716 --> 38:22.552
I was living with, like,
an eating disorder.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.637
And I hope by the time
I'm in college,

38:24.721 --> 38:27.891
I will be in a lot better place,
mentally.

38:27.932 --> 38:30.560
Isabelle reminded me
that the locker room

38:30.643 --> 38:33.813
is a terrifying place
for a girl.

38:33.897 --> 38:37.400
In the summer between
fifth grade and sixth grade

38:37.442 --> 38:40.362
at day camp, this girl --

38:40.403 --> 38:44.532
let's call her
Sally Steinberg --

38:44.574 --> 38:46.910
cornered me in the locker room,

38:46.993 --> 38:50.997
and she said,
"I know you're wearing a wig."

38:51.081 --> 38:53.208
And I said, "No, I'm not."

38:53.291 --> 38:56.419
And then she said,
"Yes, you are."

38:56.503 --> 39:00.423
And it was devastating,
and it was frightening.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.925
I was mortified.

39:02.008 --> 39:04.552
It felt like she was saying,

39:04.594 --> 39:08.306
"You're not one of us,
and you'll never be,

39:08.390 --> 39:09.933
and I know."

39:12.852 --> 39:14.145
So I, like --

39:14.229 --> 39:16.106
So you know how I was talking
about my eating disorder?

39:16.189 --> 39:17.399
-Yeah.
-For years -- If I can ask --

39:17.440 --> 39:18.817
Can I ask you a question?
Sure.

39:18.900 --> 39:20.568
Okay, so for years,
did you, like,

39:20.610 --> 39:22.028
stand in the mirror for, like,
hours and just, like,

39:22.112 --> 39:24.447
look at yourself and like...
I do that all the --

39:24.489 --> 39:26.950
And like, even if I pass
a mirror now, I'm like --

39:27.033 --> 39:29.869
And I, like,
have cellulite on my legs now

39:29.953 --> 39:31.871
from working out and stretch
marks, and I'm like --

39:31.955 --> 39:33.623
But, like, they're so beautiful
because it shows, like,

39:33.707 --> 39:36.126
I'm overcoming something
and growing.

39:41.756 --> 39:44.050
I'm just jealous
of your hip flexors.

39:50.223 --> 39:51.975
It's like, my quads and stuff

39:52.017 --> 39:54.728
are bigger now
'cause like, they've got,

39:54.811 --> 39:58.148
like, all the muscles
flowing into them.

40:01.985 --> 40:04.029
I'll show you
the before and after.

40:04.112 --> 40:05.405
Yeah, show us.

40:05.488 --> 40:07.032
Okay, that was a bad video,
but it's fine.

40:07.115 --> 40:10.076
How much do you think
it has to do with looks?

40:10.160 --> 40:11.327
Great question.

40:11.369 --> 40:13.621
This is something I have thought

40:13.663 --> 40:15.123
about for years,
to be completely honest,

40:15.165 --> 40:17.959
how much looks matters
during sorority recruitment.

40:18.001 --> 40:20.503
And I think it matters
to a certain extent.

40:20.587 --> 40:23.757
Again, you have to be
"pretty enough" to get in.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.761
I would say they only really,
truly matter at round one.

40:29.679 --> 40:31.765
Just from talking to women
all over the country,

40:31.848 --> 40:34.601
I have realized
there's four main steps

40:34.684 --> 40:36.895
that really
help women stand out.

40:36.978 --> 40:38.730
First one is all about
getting your name out there,

40:38.813 --> 40:40.357
because you want people
talking about you

40:40.440 --> 40:42.025
before sorority recruitment
starts.

40:42.108 --> 40:45.153
The second step I always take
my clients through is mindset,

40:45.195 --> 40:48.948
because sorority recruitment
is an emotional journey.

40:49.032 --> 40:50.450
You immediately get
in your head.

40:50.533 --> 40:52.452
What happened?
Am I not pretty enough?

40:52.535 --> 40:53.787
Am I not cool enough?

40:53.870 --> 40:55.663
Like, why did these
sororities drop me?

40:55.705 --> 40:58.208
The third step is
the most important one,

40:58.291 --> 40:59.918
I believe, is small talk.

41:00.001 --> 41:02.837
We figure out your answers to
the questions through a formula

41:02.879 --> 41:04.964
because there really just
is a simple formula.

41:05.048 --> 41:08.385
And the last step
is optimization strategy,

41:08.468 --> 41:10.136
which is just playing the game.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.722
Sorority recruitment's a game --
you have to know how to play it

41:12.764 --> 41:15.183
to keep
sororities interested in you.

41:15.225 --> 41:16.726
If you're getting
an average score,

41:16.810 --> 41:18.687
you're not getting invited back.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.814
Some girls get
their second choice.

41:20.897 --> 41:23.692
Some girls have been dropped
so much in the process,

41:23.775 --> 41:25.402
and they just settled.

41:25.443 --> 41:27.737
And some girls, they get calls
right before Bid Day, like,

41:27.779 --> 41:31.199
saying, "You've been dropped
from sorority recruitment."

41:31.241 --> 41:32.784
Which is hard.

41:40.625 --> 41:42.002
Do I look Southern?

41:42.085 --> 41:44.254
Definitely there,
they don't like girls

41:44.295 --> 41:46.006
who look "too Northern."

41:46.089 --> 41:47.424
I look very Northern.

41:47.465 --> 41:49.050
Like, that's not going
to change that much.

41:49.092 --> 41:56.099
Okay, I saved this one for last
because, oh, it is so unique,

41:56.641 --> 41:58.143
and I love to be unique,

41:58.226 --> 42:02.272
and this is definitely
just a great, unique dress.

42:02.313 --> 42:03.857
Tomorrow I'm gonna go pick up

42:03.940 --> 42:06.818
my sorority dress
for my sorority,

42:06.901 --> 42:08.570
and I'm rushing my sorority.

42:08.611 --> 42:10.030
What sorority do you want
to be in?

42:10.113 --> 42:13.241
The sorority I want to
be in is to not --

42:13.283 --> 42:15.994
to not be discussed,
because that brings bad luck

42:16.077 --> 42:18.038
if I tell you guys.

42:18.121 --> 42:20.540
Those boys are fine.

42:22.292 --> 42:25.754
That one -- not the one
with the long things,

42:25.837 --> 42:30.550
but the mixed one
with the curly hair.

42:30.633 --> 42:32.093
-No, bro.
-What?

42:32.135 --> 42:36.473
When we rush,
it's gonna be like...

42:36.514 --> 42:37.807
real crazy.

42:37.849 --> 42:40.977
Hey. Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

42:43.938 --> 42:46.608
If you thought Alabama Rush
was crazy,

42:46.649 --> 42:49.402
just wait until you hear
about The Machine.

42:49.486 --> 42:51.988
Burglary, cross burning,
vandalism.

42:52.030 --> 42:54.532
You are deep into it
that you have found out

42:54.616 --> 42:56.159
about The Machine.

42:56.201 --> 42:57.994
Congratulations.

43:06.252 --> 43:09.839
Have you guys heard of
this thing, "The Machine"?

43:09.923 --> 43:11.341
Do you know about that?

43:11.383 --> 43:14.177
For...? For sororities?

43:14.260 --> 43:16.680
No, it's like, for all
Greek life in Alabama

43:16.763 --> 43:20.809
and it's on the Internet,
and I was like, what is this?

43:20.892 --> 43:23.895
I don't think I know.

43:25.188 --> 43:27.565
Like, I don't think
it's an actual thing.

43:27.649 --> 43:29.317
We always get asked this.

43:29.359 --> 43:30.902
People ask us this all the --

43:30.985 --> 43:32.487
Because it is on social media.

43:32.529 --> 43:33.822
All my friends
from home think...

43:33.863 --> 43:35.407
-They're like, ooh.
-Yeah.

43:36.950 --> 43:38.827
What's the deal
with The Machine?

43:38.868 --> 43:40.286
No, I can't talk about that.

43:40.370 --> 43:42.956
-Can't talk about it.
-Yeah.

43:43.039 --> 43:44.749
It'd ruin, like,
a lot of stuff for us.

43:44.833 --> 43:46.835
Even our life, honestly?

43:46.918 --> 43:49.045
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-It's deep.

43:51.464 --> 43:52.716
Mnh-mnh.

43:52.799 --> 43:55.301
We would never get
into a sorority again.

43:55.385 --> 43:59.139
-No. Danger.
-Okay.

43:59.222 --> 44:01.224
I'm John Archibald.

44:01.266 --> 44:04.102
I've been a journalist
in Alabama for --

44:04.185 --> 44:06.229
God -- 36 years now,

44:06.271 --> 44:09.315
and I got my start
at the University of Alabama

44:09.399 --> 44:11.067
because of The Machine.

44:15.780 --> 44:17.574
It's a secret society.

44:17.615 --> 44:19.242
I believe that the phrase was,

44:19.284 --> 44:23.038
"little is known,
and what is known is secret."

44:23.121 --> 44:26.124
Something very similar to that.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.294
So The Machine
is the Greek system.

44:29.377 --> 44:31.212
They go synonymous,
they're hand in hand.

44:31.254 --> 44:32.714
It's the exact same thing.

44:32.756 --> 44:34.174
They control everything
on this campus.

44:34.257 --> 44:36.426
So if there's an election,
The Machine's rigging it.

44:36.468 --> 44:39.512
If there's a Homecoming queen,
it's The Machine candidate.

44:39.596 --> 44:42.349
You're going to look at awards
and different jobs and networks,

44:42.432 --> 44:45.185
it's all going to The Machine
kids that run their own thing.

44:45.268 --> 44:47.896
Even the most trivial things
like football seats,

44:47.979 --> 44:49.272
it's going to The Machine kids.

44:49.356 --> 44:52.609
Every Greek house
that's a member of The Machine

44:52.692 --> 44:54.152
each have Machine
representatives.

44:54.235 --> 44:55.987
These representatives
form a council that meets

44:56.071 --> 44:58.948
in fraternity basements
to discuss student politics,

44:59.032 --> 45:00.909
and then they report back
to their house

45:00.950 --> 45:03.578
and their student politicians
within those houses

45:03.661 --> 45:05.914
and tell them how to vote.

45:05.955 --> 45:08.166
You know, I wish that
I could say that I had never

45:08.249 --> 45:10.251
gotten involved with The Machine
in the first place,

45:10.335 --> 45:12.128
but like, I did.

45:12.212 --> 45:15.298
I really did try
to be a good Machine senator,

45:15.382 --> 45:16.883
But at the end of the day,

45:16.966 --> 45:20.011
something just felt
really dark and ugly about it.

45:22.263 --> 45:26.810
We slowly make our way over
to the Kappa Alpha house,

45:26.851 --> 45:29.521
and we go downstairs
into the basement,

45:29.604 --> 45:31.940
and I kind of peer in
and can see

45:32.023 --> 45:35.068
this circle
of people standing around

45:35.151 --> 45:39.114
in this kind of like dingy,
smelly fraternity basement.

45:39.155 --> 45:41.616
I'm asking myself,
"What have I got myself into?"

45:41.658 --> 45:42.826
Because I'm like, number one,

45:42.867 --> 45:44.285
why are we meeting
in a basement?

45:44.327 --> 45:46.705
Number two, why are we meeting
at, you know,

45:46.788 --> 45:48.581
10:00, 11:00 at night
on a Tuesday?

45:48.665 --> 45:49.874
What are we hiding?

45:49.958 --> 45:51.376
The individual
leading the meeting,

45:51.459 --> 45:53.795
he was like, "This is just
an opportunity for you

45:53.837 --> 45:55.588
to see each other's faces.

45:55.672 --> 45:56.756
This is, like,
the group of people

45:56.840 --> 45:59.259
you're going to
be working with."

45:59.342 --> 46:01.094
Up until that point,
I didn't understand

46:01.177 --> 46:05.181
that I was essentially
going to be a figurehead

46:05.223 --> 46:09.019
that was going to do what
my Machine rep told me to do.

46:09.102 --> 46:11.980
And, you know,
every time I did something

46:12.022 --> 46:14.566
that she wanted me to do,

46:14.649 --> 46:16.860
I always received
positive feedback.

46:16.901 --> 46:18.528
I always received praise.

46:18.570 --> 46:22.032
In that moment, I felt like
I was doing something good,

46:22.115 --> 46:24.200
but I really wasn't doing
anything at all

46:24.284 --> 46:26.411
except, you know,
being a puppet.

46:26.494 --> 46:30.290
I think it's ridiculous that
sororities require you to send

46:30.373 --> 46:33.084
a screenshot
of your voting receipt, right?

46:33.168 --> 46:35.211
Others want the e-mail
of your voting receipt, like,

46:35.295 --> 46:38.089
and if you don't send that in,
some sororities fine you.

46:39.299 --> 46:42.927
My sorority reacted
very negatively to the article,

46:43.011 --> 46:45.555
because The Machine
is the Greek system.

46:45.597 --> 46:49.934
I think it was perceived as me
going against my own sisterhood

46:50.018 --> 46:52.062
and my own sorority.

46:52.103 --> 46:55.065
Only a handful of
independent candidates

46:55.148 --> 46:59.235
have successfully gone against
The Machine and beat them.

46:59.319 --> 47:01.571
The university actually
had to shut down

47:01.613 --> 47:06.993
the Student Government
Association from 1993 until 1996

47:07.077 --> 47:10.330
because of The Machine's
alleged activities.

47:24.260 --> 47:29.099
The Machine systematically
made sure that a minority group

47:29.140 --> 47:34.646
on campus of "elite people"
who got special treatment,

47:34.729 --> 47:36.231
who lived in special homes,

47:36.272 --> 47:40.193
who came from the most affluent
and powerful families,

47:40.276 --> 47:42.737
got an advantage
on everyone else.

47:42.779 --> 47:45.031
It's a way better teacher
of how to do

47:45.115 --> 47:48.451
nefarious things for power

47:48.535 --> 47:51.996
than you could ever get
in a political science class.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.792
But I think it's a threat
to people's hopes and dreams

47:55.875 --> 47:59.129
that they may not be able
to fit into the crowd

47:59.170 --> 48:02.716
in maybe the tax bracket
they want to fit into.

48:02.799 --> 48:05.093
I think the danger
is not belonging,

48:05.176 --> 48:08.138
it's not being one
of the chosen people.

48:12.851 --> 48:14.185
Okay.

48:14.269 --> 48:17.063
Little update for you guys.
I'm so excited.

48:17.147 --> 48:20.316
We are 139 days from me

48:20.358 --> 48:23.486
attending the University
of Alabama and rushing.

48:23.570 --> 48:27.157
It is so nice to see,
like, an actual copy

48:27.198 --> 48:29.993
in my hand
of my sorority résumé.

48:30.076 --> 48:32.078
I've had three different
people proof it.

48:32.162 --> 48:33.413
I need to tweak a few things.

48:33.496 --> 48:35.331
I'm going to bring
this light pink down.

48:35.373 --> 48:38.376
And then I also have
my headshot.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.253
I probably look my best
in this photo.

48:40.337 --> 48:43.131
It's honestly been really
therapeutic doing this résumé

48:43.173 --> 48:44.841
and just creating this.

48:44.883 --> 48:46.509
I've been super stressed out
with school

48:46.593 --> 48:50.347
and just life in general and
my anxiety has been really bad,

48:50.430 --> 48:52.515
so honestly, what's been
pushing me through each day

48:52.557 --> 48:54.601
is reminding myself
that I get to go to the school

48:54.684 --> 48:57.812
that I've wanted to go to
since my freshman year,

48:57.854 --> 48:59.689
and I also get to rush

48:59.731 --> 49:02.025
and meet a bunch of new people.

49:02.108 --> 49:04.527
On the days when I feel
super lonely at home,

49:04.569 --> 49:07.364
that's what I think about
constantly, is how I get to

49:07.447 --> 49:09.199
go to a new school
and meet new people.

49:09.240 --> 49:12.327
So if you're feeling down
right now,

49:12.369 --> 49:14.662
just think of the future
and think of the positive,

49:14.704 --> 49:15.997
'cause that's what
I've been doing.

49:16.039 --> 49:18.208
Just an update for y'all.

49:26.424 --> 49:27.676
♪ Hey ♪

49:27.717 --> 49:30.345
♪ Am I normal enough? ♪

49:31.554 --> 49:34.391
So why do you think
you need a Rush consultant?

49:34.474 --> 49:37.185
Just 'cause I didn't have
anyone in my family

49:37.227 --> 49:39.270
that's been through
the Rush process,

49:39.354 --> 49:44.275
so going to her would help,
like, get all my stuff in order.

49:44.359 --> 49:47.570
So when I walk in the house,
you know, like in

49:47.654 --> 49:52.283
the open house or whatever,
and you meet them and like,

49:52.367 --> 49:54.202
I'm talking,
having a conversation

49:54.244 --> 49:57.455
and then I run out of,
like, things to say

49:57.539 --> 50:00.250
and I'm just staring back
at them, like,

50:00.333 --> 50:02.002
what am I supposed to do?

50:02.085 --> 50:06.172
I can help you be prepared
for that awkwardness,

50:06.256 --> 50:07.799
and so you're not
going to have it.

50:07.882 --> 50:10.468
Somebody else can be awkward.
You're not gonna be awkward.

50:10.552 --> 50:11.511
Just sayin'.

50:11.594 --> 50:13.013
So does that answer
your question?

50:13.096 --> 50:14.097
That make you feel
a little bit better?

50:14.180 --> 50:15.348
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

50:15.432 --> 50:16.725
So we do résumé and pictures,

50:16.766 --> 50:20.311
and then we start working
on your recommendations.

50:20.395 --> 50:22.105
I used to be
a professional photographer,

50:22.147 --> 50:26.359
so I can shoot a few pictures
of you today if you want.

50:26.443 --> 50:29.237
Look up at me.

50:29.279 --> 50:30.947
I really want
to do one with you

50:30.989 --> 50:33.867
laying with your feet
crossed behind you.

50:33.950 --> 50:35.076
Hold on.

50:38.413 --> 50:41.708
I've lived one of their
worst nightmares.

50:41.791 --> 50:45.420
I can still smell
the smells of the dorm room.

50:47.839 --> 50:50.592
I remember this girl
was sitting,

50:50.633 --> 50:54.095
leaning against the wall,
reading a book, like,

50:54.137 --> 50:55.889
while she was
waiting to find out.

50:55.972 --> 50:57.182
And I was like,

50:57.265 --> 50:59.434
"How can anybody
be that confident

50:59.476 --> 51:00.977
that they're getting in
the sorority?"

51:01.061 --> 51:03.480
This girl got into
a sorority and I didn't,

51:03.521 --> 51:06.483
and I was just weeping
for hours.

51:06.524 --> 51:09.569
I was embarrassed.
What did I do? Am I ugly?

51:09.652 --> 51:12.155
What is it about me
that I can't be getting ready

51:12.197 --> 51:14.366
to go to a social tonight?

51:14.449 --> 51:17.160
I went back through Rush
my sophomore year

51:17.202 --> 51:19.162
and got my first choice,

51:19.204 --> 51:22.624
but it has made me
uniquely understand

51:22.665 --> 51:26.503
the feelings
that these girls are having.

51:26.544 --> 51:31.549
I can recall that feeling
just like it was yesterday.

51:31.633 --> 51:35.345
From that experience, that's why
I started this business.

51:35.387 --> 51:37.013
Now do, like,
a really big smile.

51:46.439 --> 51:50.985
God, you are so perfect
for this.

51:51.069 --> 51:53.863
Hold on, one second.

51:56.700 --> 51:59.202
Everyone here thinks
I'm everything but Black.

51:59.244 --> 52:03.081
Like, I'm white and Black.
They think I'm everything.

52:03.164 --> 52:05.750
Like, this one guy thought --
Like, he was --

52:05.834 --> 52:09.212
He swore that I was just white
and just really, really tan.

52:09.254 --> 52:11.715
-Tan.
-Yeah.

52:11.798 --> 52:17.470
I was like, can you not tell,
like, I'm mixed?

52:17.554 --> 52:21.349
Everyone here just look at you
if you have any color in you.

52:21.391 --> 52:24.769
It's just, like,
really awkward, I guess.

52:24.853 --> 52:28.481
I feel like a black sheep.

52:28.565 --> 52:31.818
If I'm too white,
then I'm whitewashed,

52:31.901 --> 52:35.155
but if I act too Black, then...

52:35.238 --> 52:37.240
I'm not white enough.

52:37.323 --> 52:38.783
Like, what am I supposed to be?

52:38.867 --> 52:41.619
'Cause I'm both races.
Why can't I just act myself?

52:41.703 --> 52:45.081
I'm not acting a race.
You can't act a race.

52:45.165 --> 52:48.543
I'm just split in two,
my whole life.

52:48.585 --> 52:52.922
I'm just gonna be split.
Society's dumb.

52:52.964 --> 52:57.886
So at the University of Alabama,
the Panhellenic sorority

52:57.927 --> 53:00.930
are historically like, white,

53:00.972 --> 53:03.266
and the Divine 9 here

53:03.350 --> 53:07.437
is historically
a Black sorority.

53:07.479 --> 53:08.646
What's the difference between

53:08.730 --> 53:10.940
Black sororities
and the white sororities?

53:10.982 --> 53:15.111
I don't really know much
about the Black sororities

53:15.153 --> 53:17.322
that much,

53:17.405 --> 53:18.823
because I haven't
actually looked into it,

53:18.907 --> 53:23.912
because I just wanted to be in
the other one.

53:25.288 --> 53:29.125
To be in a D9 sorority,
I feel like there is

53:29.209 --> 53:31.544
a tie to history
that you need to have.

53:31.628 --> 53:35.215
Even had I become
more comfortable

53:35.298 --> 53:37.759
with who I was
in a racial sense,

53:37.842 --> 53:41.304
I still feel like
I wouldn't fit in there,

53:41.388 --> 53:43.807
because I was raised
by white people.

53:43.848 --> 53:46.476
I think that they
would have accepted me,

53:46.518 --> 53:49.604
but I wouldn't have
accepted myself enough

53:49.646 --> 53:51.690
to get the sorority experience

53:51.773 --> 53:53.817
that I would
have been happy with.

53:53.858 --> 53:59.239
So in my sorority, I haven't had
any overt racist experiences,

53:59.322 --> 54:02.325
but I have had some weird things

54:02.367 --> 54:05.328
that people feel empowered
to say to me.

54:05.370 --> 54:07.706
I was at chapter for
formal chapter.

54:07.789 --> 54:11.376
So we have to be, you know,
in business casual, essentially,

54:11.459 --> 54:13.712
and I...
there were a group of girls,

54:13.795 --> 54:16.131
and there was one girl
in my sorority that,

54:16.172 --> 54:18.591
she is --

54:18.675 --> 54:21.344
she -- she wants so badly
to be progressive

54:21.428 --> 54:23.221
and to be like "woke"
or whatever.

54:23.304 --> 54:25.181
She goes, "Oh, my God, Rian,
your hair is curly."

54:25.265 --> 54:27.434
I'm like,
"Yeah, yeah, I haven't...

54:27.517 --> 54:28.685
I didn't straighten it."

54:28.727 --> 54:30.687
She goes,
"Did your relaxer wash out?"

54:30.729 --> 54:32.772
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
Oh, my God."

54:32.856 --> 54:35.358
Like, what does that even mean?
Like, what...?

54:35.400 --> 54:37.360
It's that she, like,
wants to, like, flex that

54:37.444 --> 54:39.070
she, like, has an understanding
of Black culture

54:39.154 --> 54:40.864
and she, like, knows
what a relaxer is,

54:40.947 --> 54:42.157
but, like, bestie girl.

54:42.240 --> 54:43.867
What?

54:43.950 --> 54:46.911
The same girl, probably
every time that I, like,

54:46.995 --> 54:49.080
sit down and I talk to her,
she's like, "Remind me.

54:49.164 --> 54:50.749
Which one of your parents
is white?"

54:50.832 --> 54:53.418
I'm like, "It's still my mom.
It is still my mom.

54:53.501 --> 54:55.378
Every single time
that you will ask me,

54:55.462 --> 54:56.713
it's still my mom."

54:56.796 --> 55:00.008
She's not getting any darker.
Like what?

55:09.225 --> 55:11.561
So I attended
the University of Alabama

55:11.644 --> 55:16.066
from the fall of 1983
through the spring of 1987.

55:16.149 --> 55:19.527
I started law school in '87
and graduated in '90,

55:19.569 --> 55:21.863
so I was there for two tours.

55:25.867 --> 55:28.787
So you would think that progress
would be made more quickly,

55:28.870 --> 55:32.332
that it wouldn't take
until the year 2013

55:32.415 --> 55:34.459
to integrate the sororities,

55:34.542 --> 55:35.919
but when you think
about the history

55:35.960 --> 55:37.420
of the sororities themselves

55:37.462 --> 55:38.797
and the history
of the state of Alabama

55:38.880 --> 55:41.341
and just
the undercurrent of racism

55:41.424 --> 55:44.594
that has been so prominent
in our history,

55:44.678 --> 55:47.555
it really doesn't surprise me
that it took that long.

55:47.597 --> 55:51.768
I didn't necessarily see it
as an option or a choice

55:51.851 --> 55:53.812
to rush Panhellenic.

55:53.895 --> 55:59.859
I didn't see any women that look
like me in those organizations.

55:59.943 --> 56:03.822
It's a busy time at Alabama.
It's time for sorority Rush.

56:03.905 --> 56:07.575
Girls brimming with excitement
at the thought of being chosen

56:07.659 --> 56:09.577
to move to Magnolia Drive.

56:09.619 --> 56:11.579
But there's another
group moving in --

56:11.621 --> 56:13.331
the Alpha Kappa Alphas.

56:14.874 --> 56:18.169
We were the first
African-American sorority

56:18.253 --> 56:19.462
on Sorority Row.

56:19.504 --> 56:21.589
We integrated Sorority Row.

56:21.673 --> 56:23.383
♪ One, two...three, four ♪

56:23.466 --> 56:27.470
♪ A-L-P-H-A K-A-P-P-A
A-L-P-H-A ♪

56:27.512 --> 56:29.889
♪ Alpha Kappa Alpha ♪

56:29.973 --> 56:33.727
♪ A-L-P-H-A K-A-P-P-A
A-L-P-H-A ♪

56:33.810 --> 56:36.688
♪ Alpha Kappa Alpha ♪

56:36.771 --> 56:42.318
One night after we were at a --
at a fraternity party,

56:42.360 --> 56:43.778
we were driving by

56:43.820 --> 56:48.074
and we noticed a smoldering
cross on the front lawn.

56:48.158 --> 56:49.534
We were terrified.

56:49.617 --> 56:52.996
And anger crept in later,
after we got beyond

56:53.079 --> 56:57.334
the shock and the dismay
of the entire situation.

56:57.375 --> 56:58.626
Now, I grew up in Alabama,

56:58.668 --> 57:02.213
so hearing that crosses
were being burned

57:02.297 --> 57:04.007
is something that
I grew up hearing about,

57:04.049 --> 57:08.762
but I had never personally seen
a cross being burned.

57:08.845 --> 57:12.682
And once you see that,
you can't unsee it,

57:12.724 --> 57:15.185
and it sticks with you
for a lifetime.

57:25.153 --> 57:29.699
I have come to know and love
the people in my sorority,

57:29.741 --> 57:33.995
and to know that they wouldn't
have loved or trusted me

57:34.037 --> 57:39.542
40, 50 years ago,
it makes me feel upset.

57:39.626 --> 57:42.879
And I -- I honestly,
for my own self-preservation,

57:42.921 --> 57:45.215
don't really like
to think about it.

58:14.035 --> 58:15.620
Little bit more?

58:15.704 --> 58:17.372
Just a little bit more.

58:17.414 --> 58:19.499
On Bid Day, we sat outside,

58:19.582 --> 58:20.834
and we could hear, like,

58:20.917 --> 58:22.252
all the screams coming from
the stadium

58:22.335 --> 58:23.586
whenever they opened
their bids.

58:23.628 --> 58:24.838
And it was just crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

58:24.921 --> 58:26.673
My friend sent me a snap,
and he was like,

58:26.756 --> 58:29.300
"The ground just rumbled."
Literally.

58:31.177 --> 58:32.303
I'm gonna rush in the fall.

58:32.387 --> 58:34.431
I'm rushing in the fall,
for sure.

58:34.514 --> 58:38.101
And then what about Abby?
I'm not planning on it.

58:38.184 --> 58:43.106
It just -- it's lot of money
and a lot of time commitment

58:43.148 --> 58:45.775
and just a lot of work,
it seems like.

58:45.817 --> 58:48.737
So there's like, almost
250 calories in my bowl,

58:48.778 --> 58:50.655
because the meat and seasoning
and everything.

58:50.739 --> 58:52.032
How do you know that?

58:52.115 --> 58:53.742
'Cause that's why
I count out the chips,

58:53.825 --> 58:56.745
so there's exactly 10 chips
in my bowl.

58:56.786 --> 58:58.329
Wait, I didn't even see you
do that, though.

58:58.413 --> 59:01.082
'Cause I -- when I was
shaking it, I counted it out.

59:01.124 --> 59:04.711
I just have this image in
my head that I need to be...

59:04.794 --> 59:08.089
like, tiny, I guess, 'cause..
You are tiny.

59:08.131 --> 59:10.300
Well, I don't --
I really don't see myself...

59:10.342 --> 59:15.889
Like, when I look at myself,
I see myself, like, as fat.

59:15.972 --> 59:17.640
Like, I know you guys
say I'm not,

59:17.724 --> 59:20.977
but, like, I see myself as that
and I can't help it.

59:21.019 --> 59:24.898
I feel like I would never have
had an eating disorder

59:24.981 --> 59:27.650
or anything
if the boys growing up

59:27.734 --> 59:28.985
didn't say what they said to me.

59:29.069 --> 59:30.904
Yeah, it is --
it really is the men.

59:30.987 --> 59:32.739
I feel like women are like --

59:32.822 --> 59:36.117
Like, you grow up to,
like, cater to men,

59:36.159 --> 59:38.495
and it's sad.

59:38.578 --> 59:41.206
Have the three of you
ever gotten in a fight?

59:42.707 --> 59:43.958
-No.
-I don't think so.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.919
We -- like, last night, okay,

59:46.002 --> 59:48.713
I get overstimulated sometimes
really easily and, like,

59:48.797 --> 59:50.298
I just break, like,
I'm just like,

59:50.340 --> 59:53.843
"Oh, my God, Stop. Like,
everything just needs to stop."

59:53.927 --> 59:55.887
And so last night,
I got a little overstimulated

59:55.970 --> 59:58.431
and I yelled at Makayla, and
then she was like, "We're good."

01:00:00.725 --> 01:00:03.269
It was bad, but we're good.

01:00:03.353 --> 01:00:04.521
Yeah, I wasn't listening to her

01:00:04.562 --> 01:00:06.398
when she
was yelling at me, either.

01:00:07.774 --> 01:00:09.859
Hardcore Southern Baptist.

01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:12.070
We're all Baptist?
I didn't know that.

01:00:12.153 --> 01:00:14.781
I think when you're
raised in Alabama,

01:00:14.864 --> 01:00:16.199
you're kind of forced to be.

01:00:16.282 --> 01:00:17.784
I don't know, there's a lot of
people in my town

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:19.077
that are, like,
Presbyterian and stuff.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:21.871
What's your relationship
with God like?

01:00:21.955 --> 01:00:24.499
I really think He's just
the anchor in my life,

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:26.960
that I need to, like, keep,

01:00:27.043 --> 01:00:31.172
'cause life be getting
real difficult sometimes.

01:00:31.214 --> 01:00:33.216
And the fact that He
risked His life --

01:00:33.299 --> 01:00:35.844
like, He died for us

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:38.138
and, like, just for our sins.

01:00:38.221 --> 01:00:40.098
I don't know,
that's just really comforting

01:00:40.181 --> 01:00:44.185
to know that someone
would do that for you.

01:00:44.227 --> 01:00:46.563
Hold up.

01:00:46.604 --> 01:00:47.731
Like, if I could do anything
ever again,

01:00:47.772 --> 01:00:49.024
it would be Rush week.

01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:50.984
The experience is worth it.
Yeah.

01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:56.656
Like, because everyone talks
about how, like, cool it is.

01:00:56.740 --> 01:00:58.700
I just want to do it.

01:00:58.783 --> 01:01:00.368
Feet are, like, on the wall?

01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:02.078
Well, that's the thing --
Makayla does that all the time.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.913
-I'm like...
-You don't think it'd be weird?

01:01:03.997 --> 01:01:05.915
I don't mean it
to be stretchy.

01:01:05.957 --> 01:01:09.878
Like...

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:11.254
I did that too well, though.

01:01:11.338 --> 01:01:13.423
Yeah, you did.
You've gone that way before.

01:01:13.465 --> 01:01:15.759
-I'm like --
-No!

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.553
No, me and Makayla were like --

01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:21.431
-We were like, "Hey."
-"Heyyy."

01:01:21.473 --> 01:01:23.641
Makayla was like, "George Bush!"

01:01:23.725 --> 01:01:26.311
Did I tell you
she did that to me?

01:01:59.761 --> 01:02:00.970
♪ Hey ♪

01:02:01.054 --> 01:02:03.014
We got roofied at a bar.

01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:04.849
So, this guy ordered us shots.

01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:06.976
One of the bartenders was
telling us how, like,

01:02:07.018 --> 01:02:08.186
when they went back
in the video footage,

01:02:08.269 --> 01:02:10.814
he, like,
slipped it into all of them.

01:02:10.855 --> 01:02:13.400
So it's nice.
We love that for us.

01:02:13.483 --> 01:02:15.944
The last thing I remember
is looking at Makayla,

01:02:15.985 --> 01:02:19.280
and I was gone, and my, like,
friend found me in the woods.

01:02:19.322 --> 01:02:21.741
We took Makayla to the hospital,
and she had, like,

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.118
drugs in her system,

01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:25.161
and we don't do drugs,
like, at all,

01:02:25.203 --> 01:02:26.663
and I was with her
the whole night.

01:02:26.705 --> 01:02:27.997
But they did find him,

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.959
and he did get beat up
really bad.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:33.920
Do you think he'll get,
like, criminal charges?

01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:36.923
If we -- If anybody
pressed any, but I'm not.

01:02:37.007 --> 01:02:38.633
I don't know, I just don't...

01:02:38.675 --> 01:02:40.260
Honestly, I don't want to go
through the whole court case,

01:02:40.343 --> 01:02:41.970
'cause I've only been through
that court case.

01:02:42.053 --> 01:02:44.180
I don't want to go
through it again. It's annoying.

01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:47.684
-Have you been roofied before?
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:47.767 --> 01:02:49.436
Like, three times before.

01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:54.733
Oh, I could give you
the pageant walk, but --

01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:58.737
It's so, like, fierce, though.

01:03:03.408 --> 01:03:05.535
♪ Heyyy ♪

01:03:05.577 --> 01:03:08.121
It's hard to be a perfectionist,
because you want everything

01:03:08.204 --> 01:03:10.540
to go in order,
and sometimes it doesn't.

01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:14.002
And when there's multiple things
that just don't go right,

01:03:14.085 --> 01:03:17.464
it really stresses me out.

01:03:17.547 --> 01:03:19.174
And my adoption, like,

01:03:19.215 --> 01:03:21.843
it triggers some of
my depression and my anxiety.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.137
When people are,
like, going distant,

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.514
it really makes me nervous
because I --

01:03:26.556 --> 01:03:28.016
I have trust issues with people,

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:32.020
and I get nervous that people
are gonna leave me.

01:03:32.103 --> 01:03:36.107
I accidentally found out
about me being adopted.

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:38.276
I'm really close with
my grandparents,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.029
and my grandpa had handed me
a paper, and he was like,

01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:43.073
"Do you think your parents
still want this paper?"

01:03:43.114 --> 01:03:45.200
And I was like,
"I don't think so.

01:03:45.241 --> 01:03:46.701
Like, let me just read it,
though."

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:48.578
I was more concerned
about my homework,

01:03:48.661 --> 01:03:50.080
and I'd read it after,

01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:52.415
and it had talked
about me being adopted,

01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:55.126
and I was like --
I thought they were joking

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:56.753
and, like,
I thought it was a joke,

01:03:56.795 --> 01:03:58.755
so I was waiting for, like,
the laughing,

01:03:58.838 --> 01:04:00.298
and there was no laughing.

01:04:00.382 --> 01:04:02.300
Like, he was just focused
on doing his own thing.

01:04:02.384 --> 01:04:04.302
He didn't even know
that it said that.

01:04:04.386 --> 01:04:08.765
So it -- it turned
my world upside down.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:12.644
Basically, I thought I knew
who I was,

01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:14.354
and then it completely changed.

01:04:14.437 --> 01:04:16.648
I've been in therapy
since I was 13,

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:20.610
and then last year, I started
doing some trauma treatments

01:04:20.652 --> 01:04:24.614
for just trauma that I didn't
even realize that I could have,

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:28.201
but it was making my anxiety
and my depression so high.

01:04:28.284 --> 01:04:31.955
I used to be able to not even
take a test in class

01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:33.623
without almost passing out.

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:36.501
So I'm really hoping that
when I get to Alabama, like,

01:04:36.584 --> 01:04:39.462
I can just always have
an open heart and an open mind

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:44.134
and just let myself be me
and not let my triggers,

01:04:44.217 --> 01:04:47.303
like, affect me
and take over my life there.

01:04:51.808 --> 01:04:53.351
Just like Shelby,

01:04:53.435 --> 01:04:55.979
I was really looking forward
to freshman year of college.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:57.480
It's a new beginning.

01:04:57.564 --> 01:05:03.486
My big plan was that
I was going to take the wig off.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.989
But when I got to college,
I was too scared.

01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:07.615
I couldn't do it.

01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:10.660
I couldn't even tell my freshman
year roommate that I wore a wig.

01:05:10.702 --> 01:05:16.416
So I slept in my wig
every single night that year.

01:05:16.499 --> 01:05:19.627
I was convinced that,
if you knew I was bald,

01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:22.213
you wouldn't want
to be my friend.

01:05:26.843 --> 01:05:28.261
I don't know.

01:05:28.345 --> 01:05:30.722
I always said I was
never going to dye my hair.

01:05:30.805 --> 01:05:32.515
And then I started, like,
I got highlights

01:05:32.557 --> 01:05:34.100
and now I just can't stop.

01:05:34.184 --> 01:05:36.728
Like, every time I love
to just go lighter and lighter.

01:05:36.811 --> 01:05:41.858
Every time she asks what I want,
I just say, "Okay, blonder."

01:05:41.941 --> 01:05:43.985
-Which one of the dates? August?
-Yeah.

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:47.364
We have Open House
and then Philanthropy.

01:05:47.447 --> 01:05:50.158
And then there's
Sisterhood Preference Day,

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.868
and then there's Bid Day.

01:06:04.756 --> 01:06:07.050
I had a whole spiritual
awakening while you were gone.

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:08.343
You don't even understand.

01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:09.844
During finals,
I definitely had, like,

01:06:09.886 --> 01:06:11.262
a blinding revelation.

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:14.099
Like, I sat myself down
in front of a mirror

01:06:14.182 --> 01:06:16.434
and was like,
"How you've been acting lately

01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:18.853
is not you,
that's out of character,

01:06:18.937 --> 01:06:20.480
and you need to
pull it together."

01:06:20.563 --> 01:06:23.441
The stuff I've been doing,
like, going out how I have been,

01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:27.487
you know, I shouldn't be
doing that on a Wednesday.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:29.280
I need to be focusing
on my studies.

01:06:29.364 --> 01:06:31.741
Like, I'm there to build
my career, make money,

01:06:31.825 --> 01:06:34.077
and build an empire.

01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:37.414
I'm not there to
see who can drink the most.

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:42.585
Like, that's just not me.
I just need to grow up.

01:06:42.669 --> 01:06:45.338
I'm not trying to force
anything anymore.

01:06:47.924 --> 01:06:49.467
Holliday: Hey,
what are you doing?

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:50.635
Driving.

01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.181
Are you okay?

01:06:55.265 --> 01:06:58.268
Oh, I just wanted
to talk to you.

01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.394
I got a text last night

01:06:59.477 --> 01:07:02.397
and someone was telling me
about how you

01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:05.942
and Kirsten were just,
like, trashing me and

01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:08.111
talking, like,
really bad about me

01:07:08.153 --> 01:07:09.654
and I just want to talk to you
about that because

01:07:09.738 --> 01:07:10.697
I don't really understand --

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.449
Who said that?

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:13.324
Huh?

01:07:13.408 --> 01:07:15.535
-Who said that?
-Emma.

01:07:15.618 --> 01:07:18.163
If I was in your position
I would be like,

01:07:18.246 --> 01:07:19.831
who am I to believe Makayla

01:07:19.914 --> 01:07:21.458
'cause she could
just be saying that

01:07:21.499 --> 01:07:23.626
and she is actually
just doing that.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.128
Well. Um.

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:27.756
Kirsten literally told Emma

01:07:27.839 --> 01:07:28.840
that you said

01:07:28.923 --> 01:07:32.218
I was psycho and clingy.

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:35.680
And I just had one
of Emma's friends --

01:07:35.764 --> 01:07:36.681
that was with her last night --

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:38.683
confirm that Kirsten said
that you said that.

01:07:43.813 --> 01:07:45.231
This is...

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:46.733
This is so annoying.

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:51.363
I just want to be
out of the drama.

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:01.081
I don't know who to believe
anymore 'cause

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:02.832
I feel like everyone just lies.

01:08:19.391 --> 01:08:20.934
All she does is
hang out with Kappas,

01:08:21.017 --> 01:08:22.310
and so she just ignores me now.

01:08:22.352 --> 01:08:24.354
It's just a sorority
she wants to be in.

01:08:24.396 --> 01:08:27.899
Well, I'm upset about it,
but, like, I -- oof. Ugh.

01:08:27.982 --> 01:08:30.276
I hate emotions.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.904
I do.
I'm so emotionally unavailable.

01:08:32.987 --> 01:08:34.656
It's so sad.

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:04.310
I was leaving a place,
and I, like, stopped

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:05.729
'cause I heard my name.

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:07.480
Like, tell me how many people
on this campus

01:09:07.564 --> 01:09:09.607
have the name Holliday?
Yeah, zero.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.234
So I was eavesdropping.
I'll be honest.

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.527
I was being nosy.
I was eavesdropping.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:14.237
I hear these girls
and they're like,

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:15.697
"Is that Holliday girl
going to rush, do you know?"

01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:17.407
And then this other girl goes,
"Well, I hope not,

01:09:17.490 --> 01:09:19.367
since she's blacklisted
from every sorority."

01:09:19.409 --> 01:09:20.785
And I was like,
"Alright, that's cool."

01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:22.912
Like, I'm not gonna waste
my time and money.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:24.581
Like, if that is like...

01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:26.374
you know, people are going to
blow smoke out their butt,

01:09:26.416 --> 01:09:29.419
but like, if that is true,
I'm not gonna waste my money.

01:09:29.461 --> 01:09:31.129
Like, there's no point.

01:09:31.212 --> 01:09:33.506
I just, like,
don't think mentally

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.175
it would be best
for me to rush again,

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.468
like, and going through that.

01:09:36.551 --> 01:09:38.261
Like, 'cause
I didn't realize, I guess,

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:39.888
until my therapist pointed out,

01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:42.432
like, how much of a mental,
like, stress it put on me.

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:45.226
And I don't need that,
because when they say,

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:47.062
like, your freshman year
is a very humbling

01:09:47.103 --> 01:09:48.897
and, like,
growing-up experience,

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.940
they truly mean that.

01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:04.120
There has been a few nights
where I couldn't sleep at night.

01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:05.538
Oh, seriously?

01:10:05.622 --> 01:10:07.540
'Cause you were scared of
what I was gonna --

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:09.459
Not really afraid of
what you're...

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:11.127
It's just how we're
gonna be perceived.

01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:12.712
The world we live in
right now is, like,

01:10:12.796 --> 01:10:14.756
very much cancel culture.
Judgmental, yeah.

01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:16.675
People are going to feel
how they're going to feel,

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.176
and I have to keep on
trucking along.

01:10:18.259 --> 01:10:19.594
Yeah.

01:10:19.636 --> 01:10:23.264
I just don't want
people to, like, hate us.

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:26.267
Or, like, hate me.
I don't want them to hate me.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:27.686
-Or us.
-And, yeah.

01:10:27.769 --> 01:10:29.646
But you're likable!

01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.401
So, with Instagram
and all social media,

01:10:34.484 --> 01:10:35.777
we first do a pre-screen.

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:37.696
So once you register,
they have your name,

01:10:37.779 --> 01:10:39.531
and if they have your name,
they have the ability

01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:41.449
to find you anywhere --
and these girls are like --

01:10:41.491 --> 01:10:43.576
should be in the FBI,
creating fake accounts

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:46.329
and, like,
making sure they find you,

01:10:46.371 --> 01:10:47.747
so they'll figure it out.

01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:49.499
So we just want to make sure
your tagged photos

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:51.918
aren't anything
that would be labeled

01:10:52.002 --> 01:10:54.129
as "a standard concern."

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:55.839
And I'm not seeing anything.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.510
So what they'll do is they will
come sit right in front of you

01:11:00.593 --> 01:11:02.429
and just start talking to you.

01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:04.180
Okay, so we'll start with
the first question.

01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:06.474
What made you pick
the University of Alabama?

01:11:06.516 --> 01:11:09.394
So I'm going into advertising
as my major, actually.

01:11:09.477 --> 01:11:11.479
They have
an amazing advertising program,

01:11:11.521 --> 01:11:13.148
like, one of the best
in the country.

01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:15.483
I think the biggest thing is
going to be the conversations.

01:11:15.525 --> 01:11:18.862
Isabelle, you know,
is really good at small talk.

01:11:18.945 --> 01:11:22.449
The only thing that I'm worried
about is that lead of getting

01:11:22.532 --> 01:11:25.452
to that next part and, like,
her thinking one step ahead,

01:11:25.535 --> 01:11:27.871
and that just comes
from practice.

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.541
-Do you dye it?
-Yeah.

01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:35.712
Like, all that is,
like, blonde now.

01:11:35.795 --> 01:11:39.507
And -- But we're only doing
a little bit lighter at a time

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:41.968
so it don't fall out.

01:11:42.052 --> 01:11:43.470
There is a look

01:11:43.553 --> 01:11:47.849
that is well put together
and showing confidence,

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:52.395
and you have to blend in
without crazy sticking out.

01:11:52.437 --> 01:11:55.106
You don't have to be
like everybody else,

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:58.610
but you just need
to not stick out.

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:02.030
Not trying to follow the crowd
or the trend,

01:12:02.113 --> 01:12:04.741
but while also fitting into

01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:07.952
a certain kind of mold
just for Rush.

01:12:08.036 --> 01:12:11.956
You don't want to give sorority
a reason to cut you.

01:12:13.708 --> 01:12:15.960
What if you just naturally
stick out?

01:12:16.044 --> 01:12:19.005
I'm thinking about myself,
because I have no hair.

01:12:19.089 --> 01:12:20.590
-Right.
-But, like,

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:23.468
how would you
approach a situation like that

01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:28.807
with somebody who just
automatically stood out?

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.809
There, how I would approach
someone who

01:12:30.892 --> 01:12:34.646
automatically stands out,
and especially

01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:39.609
in a place like Alabama,
we have a lot of clients

01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:43.988
who stand out
for whatever reason,

01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:47.075
but I make sure
that they're willing to listen

01:12:47.158 --> 01:12:48.326
and they have to trust me.

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:51.204
They have to trust that I...

01:12:51.287 --> 01:12:53.707
am not going to
steer them wrong.

01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:56.626
If you own it, I think
you're -- you're great.

01:12:56.668 --> 01:12:59.295
This girl is not owning it.

01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:02.841
This is me freshman year,
in my wig.

01:13:02.924 --> 01:13:06.511
The only time I took
my wig off that year

01:13:06.594 --> 01:13:09.973
would be in the privacy
of the shower stall

01:13:10.056 --> 01:13:11.641
in the bathroom.

01:13:11.725 --> 01:13:17.689
I would take my wig off and let
the water pour over my head,

01:13:17.772 --> 01:13:22.027
and then I'd put my wig
back on and I would wash it,

01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:27.490
and I would go into my bedroom
at the dorm

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:32.370
like nothing had happened,
like everything was normal.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:37.375
Eventually, my sophomore year,

01:13:37.459 --> 01:13:42.797
the pain of not being myself

01:13:42.839 --> 01:13:49.846
became greater
than my need to fit in.

01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:57.520
I finally took my wig off.
It was just a simple action.

01:13:57.562 --> 01:13:59.939
Just like -- Whhhh!

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.527
But I felt like
a thousand-pound helmet,

01:14:04.569 --> 01:14:09.616
and it was the hardest thing

01:14:09.699 --> 01:14:15.455
I have ever done
in my entire life.

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:18.541
And I did it,

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:22.212
and I took my wig off,

01:14:22.253 --> 01:14:24.214
and I never put it back on.

01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:31.221
And I owned it,

01:14:31.262 --> 01:14:33.223
because I'm a bald girl.

01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:38.478
That's it.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:39.896
Hi, guys.

01:14:39.979 --> 01:14:42.315
I'm rushing at the
University of Alabama this fall,

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:45.402
and I'm going to show you guys
what is in my Rush bag.

01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:47.904
Static guard, scissors,

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:52.742
tweezers, Tide To Go pen,
a first-aid kit, mints,

01:14:52.826 --> 01:14:56.538
breath strips,
sunglasses, portable charger,

01:14:56.621 --> 01:14:58.081
and then a yoga mat.

01:14:58.164 --> 01:15:00.083
And I didn't cut it in case
anybody else needs a seat.

01:15:00.166 --> 01:15:03.795
I wanted to be able to share
with them, so I didn't cut it.

01:15:03.878 --> 01:15:06.506
And that is everything
in my Rush bag, so...

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:08.591
This is the kind of woman
that you want to marry.

01:15:08.633 --> 01:15:11.052
This one right here, okay?

01:15:11.094 --> 01:15:13.763
She is more prepared
to take my three children...

01:15:13.847 --> 01:15:17.934
This girl is the equivalent
of a CVS receipt.

01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:20.061
I want to be stuck
with this girl

01:15:20.103 --> 01:15:21.604
if we're all going down.

01:15:21.646 --> 01:15:24.607
Because of this girl,
I'm inspired now to dive deep

01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:26.151
into sorority TikTok.

01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:30.864
Now, here is a hard copy

01:15:30.947 --> 01:15:32.449
of your résumé
with that picture.

01:15:32.532 --> 01:15:34.200
Do you like that picture?

01:15:35.535 --> 01:15:39.080
That's the one you sent me.

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:40.874
Yes.

01:15:40.957 --> 01:15:44.002
And that's the one that
you want to use for that?

01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.422
Do you think
we should change it?

01:15:47.505 --> 01:15:48.673
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

01:15:48.757 --> 01:15:49.966
I think we should change it.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.926
Super important that
you look friendly,

01:15:51.968 --> 01:15:55.138
engaging, and really excited
to be doing this video.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.767
Smiling the entire time
you're talking.

01:15:59.976 --> 01:16:03.480
It's a necessary evil, so...

01:16:04.856 --> 01:16:06.733
Hi. My name is Makayla Miller.

01:16:06.816 --> 01:16:08.818
I'm going through recruitment
as a sophomore.

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:10.904
Authenticity is
my number one core value.

01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:12.822
In a sorority, like in life,

01:16:12.864 --> 01:16:15.617
connecting and finding
true sisterhood can only be done

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.285
by being authentic.

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:18.828
Respect is also a key value.

01:16:18.912 --> 01:16:20.997
I think sisterhood involves

01:16:21.081 --> 01:16:24.167
sisterhood involves
respecting your sisters

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:25.627
in all they do.

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:28.088
I look forward to meeting y'all,
and Roll Tide.

01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:29.714
More?

01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:31.049
Oh, we're going to do
a few more.

01:16:31.132 --> 01:16:33.718
I don't know if this is
a little too va-va-voom,

01:16:33.802 --> 01:16:35.261
but that's an option.

01:16:35.345 --> 01:16:36.763
So, do you have a different
dress for each round?

01:16:36.846 --> 01:16:38.181
I mean, each day of Sisterhood?
Mm-hmm.

01:16:38.264 --> 01:16:40.141
I don't have all of them yet,
but I have, like,

01:16:40.183 --> 01:16:42.686
ones that I've been
looking at all summer.

01:16:42.727 --> 01:16:45.397
I just don't want to look like
everyone else either.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.690
Because I know I'm gonna show up

01:16:46.731 --> 01:16:48.108
wearing the same thing
as someone else.

01:16:48.191 --> 01:16:49.401
I do not want that.

01:16:49.484 --> 01:16:52.987
Hmm, I don't know
about this place.

01:16:53.029 --> 01:16:57.742
It seems like a store
my mom would like, though.

01:16:57.826 --> 01:16:59.744
She now sort of looks
like a Disney princess.

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:00.954
A Disney princess!

01:17:01.037 --> 01:17:02.664
But taking it and wrapping it,

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:04.666
so you get some tension
and, like --

01:17:04.749 --> 01:17:06.084
tension and keeping it straight.

01:17:06.167 --> 01:17:07.544
That's pretty comfortable,
isn't it?

01:17:07.585 --> 01:17:08.962
It's not bad.

01:17:09.045 --> 01:17:11.881
You could sleep with that
and not look too crazy.

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:14.551
Beautiful.
I need to empty this out.

01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:29.357
Hey, guys. I am hoping
you're having a great day.

01:17:29.399 --> 01:17:30.775
Not a good day. A great day.

01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:34.863
It's about damn time.
Rush is back, bitches!

01:17:34.904 --> 01:17:38.742
Here we go.
Bama Rush, Season 2.

01:17:38.783 --> 01:17:40.201
Much like everyone else
in America this week,

01:17:40.243 --> 01:17:42.579
I will not be doing any work
at my corporate job,

01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:44.080
and instead,
I will be allocating

01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:47.917
every thought and conversation
I have to Bama Rush.

01:17:54.132 --> 01:17:58.053
Oh, this is my little chair.
This actually goes here.

01:17:59.346 --> 01:18:01.806
Everyone made fun of me
for this, but it's nice,

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:03.266
because we sit on my carpet,

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:05.352
so, like, if my friends
are sitting on my carpet,

01:18:05.435 --> 01:18:07.520
I can sit on the pink chair.

01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:09.647
I'm really big on crystals.

01:18:09.731 --> 01:18:11.649
It's a little piece of home,
but there's like,

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:13.943
a lot of bad energy
being carried on these.

01:18:14.027 --> 01:18:16.154
Like, when I first got
all these, I felt really happy,

01:18:16.237 --> 01:18:18.156
and then just a lot
of bad things happened,

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:21.451
and I just feel like
I need a recharge.

01:18:30.585 --> 01:18:33.254
Two weeks before I came to
the University of Alabama,

01:18:33.296 --> 01:18:35.465
I was sexually assaulted.

01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.804
When it happened, like,

01:18:40.887 --> 01:18:42.847
I blamed myself
and blamed myself

01:18:42.931 --> 01:18:44.349
and blamed myself.

01:18:44.432 --> 01:18:46.851
But I was, like, you know,

01:18:46.935 --> 01:18:48.728
like, that was the moment
I realized, I was like,

01:18:48.812 --> 01:18:51.147
I need to become
my biggest protector.

01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:54.984
And, you know, I feel like
I'm a very trusting person.

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:56.986
And I was like,
it is good to be trusting

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:58.822
and it is good to look
for the best in people

01:18:58.863 --> 01:19:00.323
and it's good to love others,

01:19:00.407 --> 01:19:02.826
but, like,
you need to protect yourself,

01:19:02.867 --> 01:19:04.577
because at the end of the day,
like,

01:19:04.661 --> 01:19:08.331
I'm the only one that was there
for myself at, like, all times.

01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:12.168
And, you know,
I know the person that I am,

01:19:12.210 --> 01:19:15.130
and the way that people saw me
was not the way I was,

01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:18.216
and they treated me
how they thought I was,

01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:21.678
and they treated me like
I was trash.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:27.017
And I was really, really hurt.

01:19:27.058 --> 01:19:28.518
And it was really hard.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.104
I had a really hard few weeks
before I came here,

01:19:31.187 --> 01:19:33.606
because
I didn't feel like myself,

01:19:33.690 --> 01:19:35.900
and I would look
in the mirror every day,

01:19:35.984 --> 01:19:38.695
and I would just see the things
that been done to me.

01:19:40.488 --> 01:19:43.033
I hate being emotional,
but it's just like...

01:19:43.074 --> 01:19:46.119
I feel like it was really weird,
just, like, coming here,

01:19:46.202 --> 01:19:47.996
because, like, literally,
like, a weight was, like,

01:19:48.079 --> 01:19:52.917
lifted off my shoulders,
because I was free from, like,

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:58.173
all the, like,
ideas about me that I had once.

01:19:58.214 --> 01:19:59.883
And I saw who, like,
I truly was

01:19:59.924 --> 01:20:01.217
and that, like, God showed me,

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:03.803
like, who I really,
truly could be.

01:20:08.350 --> 01:20:13.813
I can, like, rewrite my story.
My story can start here.

01:20:15.690 --> 01:20:16.941
I've been placed with a lot

01:20:17.025 --> 01:20:19.569
of just really amazing
female mentors.

01:20:19.652 --> 01:20:21.279
My therapist,
she is one of them.

01:20:21.363 --> 01:20:25.408
My mom is one of them, and my
church leaders are some of them.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:28.244
All these women, like,
have really just like,

01:20:28.286 --> 01:20:31.331
just shown me, like,
the person, like, I want to be,

01:20:31.414 --> 01:20:35.293
which is exactly what
Greek life is about.

01:20:35.377 --> 01:20:37.587
Every single girl
in all of these houses

01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:41.257
has gone through some amount
of struggle in their life.

01:20:43.551 --> 01:20:45.261
These are really strong women

01:20:45.303 --> 01:20:47.180
who want to get involved
in their school

01:20:47.263 --> 01:20:49.933
and who are passionate about
building each other up.

01:20:50.016 --> 01:20:54.854
Like, it is a sisterhood,
and that's why I want to rush.

01:20:56.648 --> 01:20:58.775
I'm "nervited"

01:20:58.858 --> 01:21:01.778
which is, like,
nervous and excited.

01:21:04.781 --> 01:21:06.116
What's the thing on TikTok --

01:21:06.199 --> 01:21:07.492
have you ever watched the one
that's like --

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:12.831
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:21:12.914 --> 01:21:14.916
♪ I wanna go to -- ♪

01:21:14.958 --> 01:21:17.502
♪ I want to go Delta Zeta...
dun, dun, dun ♪

01:21:17.585 --> 01:21:18.795
It was something like that.

01:21:18.878 --> 01:21:20.088
It was --
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:24.592
-Zeta Tau Alpha.
-Yup. They're huge.

01:21:24.634 --> 01:21:26.428
And that's Sigma Kappa.

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:34.686
I should have did this
last night.

01:21:34.769 --> 01:21:36.354
Rachel,
what's the triangle mean?

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:42.902
The triangle is
Delta and the Alpha...

01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:44.404
Gamma Delta.

01:21:44.487 --> 01:21:45.989
Yeah. AGD.

01:21:46.031 --> 01:21:48.992
We're going to need, like,
a whole alphabet.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.327
I'm gonna carry it around
with me.

01:21:51.411 --> 01:21:53.663
I found it.

01:21:53.705 --> 01:21:58.376
Yes, Zaya.
This one goes with that.

01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:00.712
There's a grand piano.
Like, right?

01:22:00.795 --> 01:22:03.882
Yeah. So, like, the stairs are
going up on either sides.

01:22:03.965 --> 01:22:05.675
It's actually really pretty.

01:22:07.635 --> 01:22:11.348
So I just have a couple
of thoughts regarding

01:22:11.431 --> 01:22:15.018
this supposed
HBO Max documentary

01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:16.895
on Bama Rush that's...

01:22:16.978 --> 01:22:20.690
Hulu or HBO Max,
whatever it is, like, TV shows.

01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:24.027
Okay, you guys, we have more
tea coming through about

01:22:24.069 --> 01:22:26.613
is someone filming Rush
this year?

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:28.114
So, Bama Rush update.

01:22:28.198 --> 01:22:30.700
I guess we'll address the
elephant in the room real quick.

01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:32.077
So I've got to bring it
to you guys,

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:33.703
but I have gotten
a couple of reports

01:22:33.787 --> 01:22:35.914
going back to potential people

01:22:35.997 --> 01:22:38.208
or a handful of PNMs
being miked up.

01:22:38.249 --> 01:22:41.211
Not to be dramatic,
but this HBO special

01:22:41.294 --> 01:22:43.755
could be the end
of Greek life as we know it.

01:22:43.838 --> 01:22:46.299
The rumor on TikTok
is that they were

01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:49.928
wearing microphones
in bracelets.

01:23:05.485 --> 01:23:06.569
Okay.

01:23:06.653 --> 01:23:10.782
All the rumors are flying
around here at Bama

01:23:10.865 --> 01:23:12.450
about HBO or Netflix.

01:23:12.534 --> 01:23:18.248
Supposedly, it's HBO that has
about 20 girls they're paying,

01:23:18.331 --> 01:23:22.127
and the girls will be miked up
going through Rush.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.753
I don't understand.

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:26.423
They're just going to have
audio, if this is true.

01:23:26.464 --> 01:23:30.677
They're not gonna have
any visual recordings.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:33.096
Um.

01:23:33.138 --> 01:23:36.641
I don't get it.
I'm quite puzzled.

01:23:36.725 --> 01:23:40.603
What do they think they're going
to gain by recording girls

01:23:40.645 --> 01:23:41.938
going through Rush?

01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:43.606
They haven't went up
against this college yet,

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:46.109
and I'm telling you,
you don't want to go up against

01:23:46.151 --> 01:23:47.610
the University of Alabama.

01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:51.364
I am not -- I'm here working.
I'm a fraternity mom.

01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:54.451
I wouldn't go up against
the University of Alabama.

01:23:54.492 --> 01:23:59.289
No way. They call them
The Machine for a reason.

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:02.375
I wouldn't go up against
the University of Alabama.

01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:07.130
No way. They call them
The Machine for a reason.

01:24:28.401 --> 01:24:32.405
This is a rumor that started
on social media

01:24:32.489 --> 01:24:39.496
that has led to an article
in The New York Times

01:24:40.038 --> 01:24:46.711
that my film that you are
watching right now

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:51.800
miked 20 potential new members

01:24:51.841 --> 01:24:58.848
to record what goes on inside
the walls of a sorority house.

01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:02.435
Anyone who makes a movie --
I'm going to wait for sound.

01:25:02.519 --> 01:25:06.022
See, the air conditioner,
for example,

01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:08.108
is going to interfere
with our sound.

01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:10.235
So we're going to hold.

01:25:12.278 --> 01:25:15.990
If an air conditioner
is going to interrupt

01:25:16.074 --> 01:25:20.203
the quality of sound
for this film,

01:25:20.245 --> 01:25:24.040
putting microphones
on girls in houses

01:25:24.124 --> 01:25:28.503
where they're all screaming
to hear each other

01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:30.463
is also
not gonna work.

01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:32.257
Just...

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:34.342
This is what we're dealing with.

01:25:34.384 --> 01:25:36.678
And not only is there
a New York Times article

01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:37.929
about this idea,

01:25:38.013 --> 01:25:40.724
later in the day,
we received a letter

01:25:40.807 --> 01:25:43.560
from the president
of the University of Alabama,

01:25:43.643 --> 01:25:47.897
and he CC'd me
and basically the Feds.

01:25:56.322 --> 01:26:00.076
But who started the rumor?
That's what I'm curious about.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.621
These accounts
don't even look real.

01:26:03.705 --> 01:26:07.208
Another rumor that goes along
with all of this

01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:13.381
is that a PNM
has already been disqualified.

01:26:13.423 --> 01:26:16.885
I kept tucking it, because --

01:26:16.926 --> 01:26:18.261
This girl was rushing.

01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:20.138
They caught her
with a black hair tie

01:26:20.221 --> 01:26:21.431
tied around her T-shirt.

01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:23.516
She got kicked out of Rush

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.936
because they thought
it was a microphone.

01:26:28.104 --> 01:26:33.401
We've never met this girl, ever.

01:26:33.443 --> 01:26:36.446
When the execs pulled me over,
I immediately knew

01:26:36.488 --> 01:26:38.365
that that could be
the reason that they pulled me.

01:26:38.448 --> 01:26:39.949
So I immediately showed them

01:26:39.991 --> 01:26:42.452
and they said that they weren't
"at liberty to check me"

01:26:42.535 --> 01:26:44.662
or they weren't "at liberty"
to look at anything.

01:26:44.746 --> 01:26:47.123
So they said basically
this was a final decision made

01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:50.460
before I even had
any chance to say anything.

01:26:50.543 --> 01:26:52.420
And I called
the dean of students,

01:26:52.462 --> 01:26:55.840
and I called the --
Ambassador of Panhellenic,

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:58.301
and they basically said
there was nothing I could do

01:26:58.343 --> 01:26:59.844
and that it was
a final decision.

01:26:59.928 --> 01:27:02.681
...little black thing,
so I kept tucking it because...

01:27:14.609 --> 01:27:18.405
You haven't lived until you are
waiting for a text message

01:27:18.488 --> 01:27:20.824
from an 18-year-old girl.

01:27:23.243 --> 01:27:25.120
We lost Shelby.

01:27:34.504 --> 01:27:36.423
It strikes me as being
very Southern,

01:27:36.506 --> 01:27:40.301
because we have
a long history of silence.

01:27:40.343 --> 01:27:43.388
What's was the first rule
of The Machine?

01:27:43.471 --> 01:27:45.765
"What is known is kept secret."

01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:47.350
No talking to the media.

01:27:47.392 --> 01:27:48.852
I could probably reach too deep

01:27:48.893 --> 01:27:51.688
and say that you probably
represent the carpetbaggers

01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:55.025
coming down to teach us
what's right and wrong.

01:28:06.911 --> 01:28:11.583
I think they believe that I'm
trying to ruin their tradition.

01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:14.377
And I think there's, like,

01:28:14.419 --> 01:28:16.504
really good things
about your traditions here,

01:28:16.546 --> 01:28:18.214
and I think there's
really toxic things

01:28:18.298 --> 01:28:19.799
about your traditions here

01:28:19.883 --> 01:28:23.762
and really confusing things
about the traditions here.

01:28:25.847 --> 01:28:29.976
But I came into this like,
literally, Roll Tide.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.230
Now that this New York Times
article has named me,

01:28:34.272 --> 01:28:35.732
I'm really paranoid.

01:28:35.815 --> 01:28:38.735
Like, everywhere I go,
I'm looking over my shoulder.

01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:42.197
Our producers are requiring
that we hire a security detail

01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.491
to be with the film's crew
at all times,

01:28:44.574 --> 01:28:46.368
because
they're actually concerned

01:28:46.409 --> 01:28:48.745
for our physical safety
at this point.

01:28:48.787 --> 01:28:51.539
Because if you
Google "Rachel Fleit,"

01:28:51.581 --> 01:28:54.626
the first image that comes up
is of a bald girl,

01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:57.545
and I haven't seen
another bald girl in Tuscaloosa

01:28:57.587 --> 01:29:00.340
since I started filming here
a year ago.

01:29:00.423 --> 01:29:03.593
And if I'm going to keep
filming with my subjects,

01:29:03.635 --> 01:29:05.679
I don't know what to do.

01:29:27.575 --> 01:29:29.828
Do I need more curls?

01:29:39.838 --> 01:29:41.131
"This is insane.

01:29:41.172 --> 01:29:44.467
This literally can't be real.
Stop feeding into it."

01:29:44.551 --> 01:29:46.302
What do you
feel like when you see that?

01:29:46.344 --> 01:29:50.473
I don't know why they are...

01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:52.851
so obsessed with it.

01:29:54.519 --> 01:29:57.147
The mike --
well, if we have mikes in there,

01:29:57.188 --> 01:29:58.565
that would pick up nothing.

01:29:58.648 --> 01:30:01.735
Plus, the conversations,
for the most part,

01:30:01.818 --> 01:30:05.697
really are, like,
not that interesting.

01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:09.492
What I'm looking most for
is, like, not all,

01:30:09.576 --> 01:30:10.952
like, the TikTok stuff.

01:30:10.994 --> 01:30:14.414
And at the end of the day,
I want best friends,

01:30:14.497 --> 01:30:15.749
and I want to have fun,

01:30:15.832 --> 01:30:18.835
like, literally
helping the community,

01:30:18.877 --> 01:30:20.587
which is what people
don't see, like,

01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:23.506
people don't see all of the good
that sororities do.

01:30:23.548 --> 01:30:28.053
It's not just Instagram posts
or, like, pretty girls.

01:30:29.512 --> 01:30:31.014
Seven houses tomorrow,

01:30:31.097 --> 01:30:34.517
and then I have two houses
on the next day after that,

01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:36.019
and then I have one house today.

01:30:36.061 --> 01:30:38.355
So I got ten houses back.

01:30:38.396 --> 01:30:43.651
Everyone has, like, told me
about how extra the girls are,

01:30:43.693 --> 01:30:45.862
like, in the door song
and stuff.

01:30:45.904 --> 01:30:49.616
And when I saw that, I was like,
what in the world?

01:30:49.699 --> 01:30:52.410
Like, I was sitting there,
like, laughing.

01:30:52.494 --> 01:30:54.537
I was like...

01:31:03.004 --> 01:31:07.550
I was like...I was like,
dude, can I really do that?

01:31:07.634 --> 01:31:10.845
'Cause I was like, I don't know.

01:31:10.887 --> 01:31:17.769
I was talking at both houses
and my lip would get stuck,

01:31:17.852 --> 01:31:21.231
like, to my teeth because
there is no spit in my mouth

01:31:21.314 --> 01:31:23.024
because I was talking so much.

01:31:23.066 --> 01:31:24.859
'Cause they give you, like,
these little water bottles,

01:31:24.901 --> 01:31:26.486
and I heard if you drink them,

01:31:26.569 --> 01:31:28.863
that it'll, like,
give you bad luck

01:31:28.905 --> 01:31:31.157
for the rest of the, like, time,

01:31:31.241 --> 01:31:34.661
so you might get dropped
or something bad will happen.

01:31:34.744 --> 01:31:36.913
So I just suffered.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:42.752
I really think you're going
to get your top seven.

01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:44.170
-Okay.
-I really think,

01:31:44.254 --> 01:31:46.297
and then Pref, it all depends

01:31:46.381 --> 01:31:48.258
on, like, what they're thinking.

01:31:57.058 --> 01:31:59.853
I realize that,
since being a sophomore now,

01:31:59.936 --> 01:32:03.189
you don't have to be in
a sorority to enjoy your life.

01:32:03.273 --> 01:32:05.859
It's just me, personally,
I don't think I can do it,

01:32:05.942 --> 01:32:08.820
but I know other girls
that love it.

01:32:12.824 --> 01:32:16.786
And when I withdrew yesterday,

01:32:16.828 --> 01:32:20.790
with my Rho Chi,
she was so, like, supportive.

01:32:20.874 --> 01:32:23.543
She just kept telling me
how she was so proud

01:32:23.626 --> 01:32:26.796
that I had, like,
an open mindset.

01:32:28.757 --> 01:32:31.384
In Atlanta, all the dresses
looked so boring.

01:32:31.468 --> 01:32:33.762
-It wasn't your style.
-Yeah.

01:32:33.803 --> 01:32:37.974
It felt like I was being, like,
forced to like them, too.

01:32:38.016 --> 01:32:39.351
It was annoying.

01:32:39.434 --> 01:32:41.811
Did you tell Trisha yet?

01:32:41.853 --> 01:32:44.898
-Yeah.
-What'd she say?

01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:47.192
Well, she just texted and said,

01:32:47.275 --> 01:32:51.071
"Okay, I'm here if you need me.
I'm always in your corner."

01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:56.326
I don't really care
about disappointing anyone.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:16.763
Highlight of my day
was going to AD Pi,

01:33:16.846 --> 01:33:20.433
and we're just talking about
making genuine conversations

01:33:20.517 --> 01:33:23.186
with people and genuine friends.

01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:25.855
Throughout this, like, journey,
like, I've changed so much.

01:33:25.897 --> 01:33:28.525
I really have, like,
been finding myself as a person.

01:33:28.566 --> 01:33:32.404
This feels more at home than
I've ever felt in a long time.

01:33:34.239 --> 01:33:39.536
You can still feel pain and
you can still be angry or sad

01:33:39.619 --> 01:33:41.705
at what's been done to you,

01:33:41.746 --> 01:33:45.166
and that doesn't
have to go away,

01:33:45.208 --> 01:33:47.502
but knowing that
there's, like, a hope

01:33:47.544 --> 01:33:50.880
and there's a plan and that...

01:33:50.964 --> 01:33:53.842
all of the power is within you

01:33:53.925 --> 01:33:57.846
and God, like,
really just has given me

01:33:57.929 --> 01:34:00.557
so much, like, will to live.

01:34:03.727 --> 01:34:06.980
Rush is about being yourself
in these houses,

01:34:07.063 --> 01:34:09.024
and I think that
whatever house I choose,

01:34:09.065 --> 01:34:12.360
I might not realize
why I chose it in the moment,

01:34:12.402 --> 01:34:14.112
or I might not realize

01:34:14.195 --> 01:34:16.906
the reason
for everything right away,

01:34:16.948 --> 01:34:19.325
but one day, it will all click.

01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:50.899
10...9....

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.109
8...7...

01:34:53.193 --> 01:34:57.655
6, 5, 4, 3...

01:34:57.739 --> 01:35:00.533
2...1...

01:35:07.665 --> 01:35:09.668
Yes!

01:35:38.488 --> 01:35:41.074
On Bid Day, all I could
think about was home.

01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:43.576
So I was just freaking out
and crying

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.078
and going back to like

01:35:45.161 --> 01:35:49.249
a place of self-hatred
and, like, not knowing who I am.

01:35:49.332 --> 01:35:53.628
And then -- this sounds so,
like, weird and fake and stupid,

01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:58.466
but, like, I -- literally all
I could think about was AD Pi

01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:00.343
and the girl, McKenna,

01:36:00.427 --> 01:36:03.888
that is now, like,
she was my Bid Day Big.

01:36:03.972 --> 01:36:05.348
Like, she was all
I could think about,

01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:08.309
and I just -- she brought me
this sense of hope

01:36:08.351 --> 01:36:11.187
and the sense
that I could, like, be myself

01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:14.983
and that I finally have
not just a home,

01:36:15.066 --> 01:36:17.318
but a place where I belong.

01:36:21.031 --> 01:36:23.950
But now I'm here,
and it's so freeing.

01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:27.120
And I feel just so, like,
not only at peace,

01:36:27.203 --> 01:36:30.540
but, like, hopeful
for the future.

01:36:35.128 --> 01:36:39.215
I worry about the --
the reception of all of this

01:36:39.257 --> 01:36:42.302
by my sorority sisters,
because I think a lot of them

01:36:42.385 --> 01:36:45.305
are going to understand it
as like a betrayal.

01:36:45.388 --> 01:36:46.556
It's like, no.

01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:49.225
But I also want
these organizations

01:36:49.309 --> 01:36:51.269
to be less concerned
with tradition

01:36:51.353 --> 01:36:55.023
and more concerned
with the well-being

01:36:55.065 --> 01:36:57.817
and the individuality
of their members.

01:36:57.901 --> 01:37:00.153
I would like to join
an alumna chapter,

01:37:00.236 --> 01:37:02.447
if they'll have me after this.

01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:04.866
I would like to.

01:37:04.908 --> 01:37:08.203
Like, the people that I met
in my sorority experience

01:37:08.244 --> 01:37:11.373
are just the best people
I've met in my entire life.

01:37:49.828 --> 01:37:51.621
It's good to be back.

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:58.586
How do you think you've changed
since we've met?

01:37:58.628 --> 01:37:59.963
Everything about me
has changed.

01:38:00.005 --> 01:38:01.297
Like, my outlook on life,

01:38:01.339 --> 01:38:04.134
my outlook on this school,
on Greek life.

01:38:04.217 --> 01:38:07.887
Like, everything.
I've grown up for sure.

01:38:07.971 --> 01:38:09.472
My mom used to have
this photo of me

01:38:09.556 --> 01:38:11.933
and I was like,
throwing up a sorority sign.

01:38:11.975 --> 01:38:14.310
I was like, "This is the
sorority I'm going to be in."

01:38:14.352 --> 01:38:17.313
When I was younger, that's,
like, all I wanted to do.

01:38:17.355 --> 01:38:19.399
But I just want to be
my own person.

01:38:19.482 --> 01:38:22.777
And I feel like they all try to
mold us to be, like, one person.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:26.990
What do you think now,

01:38:27.073 --> 01:38:29.784
being on the other side
of Rush?

01:38:29.868 --> 01:38:31.870
Well, I think it...

01:38:31.953 --> 01:38:33.913
Like, when you're born,

01:38:33.997 --> 01:38:37.417
you automatically are
wanting to belong,

01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.003
'cause you're just
sitting there, crying,

01:38:40.086 --> 01:38:42.130
you're wanting, like, comfort,

01:38:42.172 --> 01:38:46.009
like, when you just got out of
this womb to this scary life.

01:38:46.092 --> 01:38:48.094
So what else are you
supposed to do?

01:38:48.178 --> 01:38:52.015
You're always going to need to
want something.

01:38:52.057 --> 01:38:53.516
You're just going to sit there.

01:39:09.949 --> 01:39:12.035
Seriously,
we're making a memory.

01:39:12.077 --> 01:39:13.953
This is a --
This is a core memory.

01:39:14.037 --> 01:39:16.915
