Ha-har!

01:01.694 --> 01:03.228
Ahoy, mateys!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.964
Do you want to join
my pirate crew?

01:07.300 --> 01:08.300
Great!

01:08.302 --> 01:10.002
To start today's adventure,

01:10.004 --> 01:12.771
everybody say
the Pirate Password.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.673
Yo-ho-ho!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.675
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:16.677 --> 01:18.010
One more time.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.079
[all] Yo-ho-ho!

01:23.316 --> 01:26.351
<i>[Jake]</i> Mama Hook Knows Best!

01:26.353 --> 01:32.591
[chuckling] It's not every day
me dear old mum comes to visit!

01:32.593 --> 01:37.329
[woman] Ahoy!
Oh, James Bartholomew!

01:37.331 --> 01:40.933
- Who's James Bartholomew?
- Never heard of him.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.334
Mummy!

01:43.670 --> 01:47.806
James Bartholomew Hook,
hoist me aboard at once!

01:47.808 --> 01:51.376
Well, you heard me mum!
Move it, men!

01:51.378 --> 01:54.313
Aye-aye, James...
I mean, cap'n.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.220
Mama Hook is here!

02:02.188 --> 02:05.224
Mother, dear,
it's so good to see you!

02:05.226 --> 02:07.392
And how was your trip?

02:07.394 --> 02:11.763
All thunder, lightning
and stormy seas!

02:11.765 --> 02:15.934
But for me it was
smooth sailing.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.638
Why, when I was a pirate
and sailed the Never Sea,

02:19.640 --> 02:23.675
there was never a problem
I couldn't handle.

02:23.677 --> 02:26.812
I know, Mother, I know.

02:26.814 --> 02:32.217
And might I say, Mrs. Hook,
ma'am, your son, my cap'n,

02:32.219 --> 02:35.654
is truly following
in your footsteps.

02:35.656 --> 02:39.158
Splendid! And that's
why I'm here, James.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.994
I want to go on a
treasure hunt with you,

02:41.996 --> 02:45.397
and then I can see
my little genius at work.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.800
Oh, what a glorious idea,
Mother, dear.

02:48.802 --> 02:54.273
Men, set sail for
Never Land and treasure!

02:54.275 --> 02:56.808
Um, what treasure, sir?

02:56.810 --> 03:00.145
Shh. Don't bother me
with details, Smee.

03:00.147 --> 03:03.448
Whatever Mummy wants,
Mummy gets!

03:05.351 --> 03:09.721
Crackers! We sure found
a lot of cool stuff
on the beach today.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.723
Check out this old teapot.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.959
[in a British accent]
Anyone for tea? [laughs]

03:13.961 --> 03:17.429
Huh? Whoa!
It's a treasure map!

03:17.431 --> 03:19.898
I wonder what kind
of treasure it is.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.835
Say, mateys, want to go
with us on a treasure hunt?

03:25.171 --> 03:28.941
Great! Remember to keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

03:28.943 --> 03:32.211
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

03:32.213 --> 03:35.714
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.482
Is everybody ready?

03:37.484 --> 03:40.185
- I've got my sword.
- I got my map!

03:40.187 --> 03:42.821
And I've got
my pixie dust.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.058
The fairies gave it to me
so that we can use it to fly.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.026
But only in emergencies.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.462
Yo-ho! Let's go!

03:54.133 --> 03:56.935
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

03:56.937 --> 03:59.771
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

03:59.773 --> 04:04.142
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

04:04.144 --> 04:07.412
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

04:07.414 --> 04:09.248
<i>¶ And me </i>

04:11.784 --> 04:14.987
This way,
Mother, dear! Uh...

04:14.989 --> 04:18.023
Pish-posh! This is
ridiculous, James.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.125
We've been
going in circles.

04:20.127 --> 04:24.096
Uh, now, Mother,
let's not abandon
ship just yet!

04:24.098 --> 04:29.868
I know there's treasure
around here... somewhere.

04:29.870 --> 04:33.372
You've no idea where any
treasure is, do you, son?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.874
Why, when I was
a young pirate

04:35.876 --> 04:39.511
I could find treasure
just like that.

04:39.513 --> 04:42.814
Of course you could, Mother.

04:42.816 --> 04:45.284
[whispering]
Help me out here, Smee!

04:45.286 --> 04:48.487
Oh. Well, I, I...
Oh, lookie, cap'n!

04:48.489 --> 04:52.090
I bet the sea pups are here
looking for treasure, too!

04:52.092 --> 04:55.527
That's it. I shall follow
those meddling scallywags,

04:55.529 --> 04:59.531
and when they find treasure,
I'll snatch it!

04:59.533 --> 05:04.002
Once I show me mum
the treasure I "found"

05:04.004 --> 05:08.473
she will surely be proud
of her little genius!

05:08.475 --> 05:10.075
[laughing]

05:10.077 --> 05:12.878
The treasure is buried
in the Hidden Hills.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.081
And the first place
on the way there is...

05:16.083 --> 05:17.949
Stepping Stone River!

05:17.951 --> 05:20.852
But how can we get
over it to the other side?

05:20.854 --> 05:22.554
I've got an idea!

05:22.556 --> 05:24.923
Those floating stones
are like stairs.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.092
We could jump up them
to get across the river.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.329
[stuttering] I'm
not so sure about this.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.164
Aw, don't worry, Cubby.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.299
Just pretend
you're a jumping frog!

05:34.301 --> 05:38.337
Come on, let's all jump.
Yo-ho, let's go!

05:40.473 --> 05:42.941
Yay-hey! We got
across the river,

05:42.943 --> 05:45.344
and we got two gold doubloons!

05:45.346 --> 05:47.045
Let's grab 'em and go.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.514
This is the way
to treasure!

05:49.516 --> 05:51.116
Follow me, everybody!

05:51.118 --> 05:54.386
Hurry up, James,
I haven't got all day.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.955
Coming, Mother, dear!

05:58.524 --> 05:59.958
[shouting]

06:01.427 --> 06:04.096
Oh, James, you're
as clumsy as ever.

06:04.098 --> 06:07.632
Why, I'll never forget the day
you learned to walk the plank

06:07.634 --> 06:11.203
and fell right into
the Never Sea. [laughing]

06:11.205 --> 06:12.637
[chuckles]

06:12.639 --> 06:14.873
[sighing, groans]

06:15.875 --> 06:18.410
- [snoring]
- Ah, coconuts!

06:18.412 --> 06:20.946
Every time we go
to Crocodile Creek,

06:20.948 --> 06:23.448
we have to get past
old Tic-Tock Croc!

06:23.450 --> 06:28.120
- Well, we could run past him.
- Or we could tiptoe past him.

06:28.122 --> 06:32.991
Or, we could slide
on this vine over him!

06:32.993 --> 06:35.961
Come on, slide with us.
Follow me.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.598
- Woo-hoo!
- Whee!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.400
Yippee!

06:42.268 --> 06:43.902
Yay-hey!

06:43.904 --> 06:46.405
We slid over the
Tic-Tock Croc.

06:46.407 --> 06:49.141
And we got three more
gold doubloons!

06:49.143 --> 06:53.078
Let's grab 'em, and
go to the Hidden Hills!

06:53.080 --> 06:56.548
Ah, this is just like
the old days, James.

06:56.550 --> 07:02.754
- the discovery of
buried treasure, the...
- [gasping] Crocodile!

07:02.756 --> 07:07.526
- [chuckling]
- Blast! Smee!

07:07.528 --> 07:12.964
- No, no. Sit! Sit!
- Huh? [whimpering]

07:12.966 --> 07:15.600
That's enough. Go home!

07:15.602 --> 07:18.069
James Bartholomew Hook!

07:18.071 --> 07:22.240
Get down from there right now
and find that treasure.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.944
- You're embarrassing me.
- [moaning]

07:28.281 --> 07:30.982
- Any sign of treasure?
- Nope.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.318
Just those
stones in a circle.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.054
Check it out!
It's just like on my map.

07:36.056 --> 07:40.492
I bet the treasure is buried
under the circle of stones.

07:43.396 --> 07:47.299
[Hook] Ah-ha! The little swabs
have found treasure.

07:47.301 --> 07:50.001
I must grab it and go.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.004
Sharky, Bones,
entertain me mum.

07:53.006 --> 07:57.042
Mr. Smee and I
shall scout up ahead.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.445
- [chuckles]
- Entertain we will, sir!

08:00.447 --> 08:02.113
[playing an upbeat song]

08:02.115 --> 08:05.250
<i>¶ The great first lady</i>
<i>of the Never Sea ¶</i>

08:05.252 --> 08:08.220
<i>¶ She's a better scallywag</i>
<i>than you or me ¶</i>

08:08.222 --> 08:11.590
<i>¶ She knows every trick</i>
<i>in the pirate book ¶</i>

08:11.592 --> 08:16.661
<i>¶ She's the one</i>
<i>and only Mama Hook ¶</i>

08:19.065 --> 08:21.633
This is my favorite part
of treasure hunting!

08:21.635 --> 08:24.503
Opening up the chest to
find out what's inside.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.038
[Hook] That's my
favorite part, too!

08:27.040 --> 08:30.108
- [laughing]
- [all] Captain Hook?!

08:30.110 --> 08:32.077
Where's Hook
taking the treasure?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.678
Ah, coconuts!

08:33.680 --> 08:37.516
[Jake] He's giving the
treasure to his mother?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.017
Hook has a mother?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.786
Mateys, we've got to
get the treasure back.

08:41.788 --> 08:47.459
Mother, dear, may I present
a treasure of riches...

08:47.461 --> 08:49.094
...for you!

08:49.096 --> 08:52.664
For me? That's my
little buccaneer!

08:52.666 --> 08:55.033
Izz, this is
an emergency.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.434
You know what to do!

08:56.436 --> 08:59.337
Yay-hey,
pixie dust away!

09:01.741 --> 09:03.508
[Jake] Ahoy, Captain Hook!

09:03.510 --> 09:06.344
- Make way!
- My word!

09:06.346 --> 09:10.181
What is going on here?
Who are you scallywags?

09:10.183 --> 09:14.319
How dare you take that
treasure away from my son!

09:14.321 --> 09:18.323
No disrespect, ma'am,
but your son, Captain Hook,

09:18.325 --> 09:20.358
took the treasure from us!

09:20.360 --> 09:24.162
James Bartholomew Hook,
is that true?

09:24.164 --> 09:27.198
[stammering]
Well, uh, you see, I, I...

09:27.200 --> 09:29.367
James.

09:29.369 --> 09:33.405
I confess. I stole the treasure.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.074
[stuttering]
But I did it for you!

09:36.076 --> 09:39.444
I just wanted you to
be proud of me. [crying]

09:39.446 --> 09:43.782
Oh, James, I've always
been proud of you,

09:43.784 --> 09:47.786
my great and glorious
pirate captain son.

09:47.788 --> 09:51.823
[crying]
Oh, oh, Mummy!

09:53.859 --> 09:57.395
There, there, James.
Mama's here.

09:57.397 --> 10:01.633
- Anyone have a hankie?
- Excuse me, Captain Hook?

10:01.635 --> 10:03.802
Why don't we all
share the treasure?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.804
[stammering] Share?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.872
- Never!
- Why, James,

10:07.874 --> 10:10.842
sharing sounds like
a wonderful idea.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.243
Open the chest!

10:12.245 --> 10:15.347
Now, let's see what
the treasure is.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.682
[Mama Hook] Teacups and saucers?

10:17.684 --> 10:19.584
How delightful!

10:19.586 --> 10:23.188
Let's have a tea
and treasure party!

10:23.190 --> 10:25.857
Yay-hey, we got
the treasure back,

10:25.859 --> 10:28.560
and we got five more
gold doubloons!

10:28.562 --> 10:32.130
Let's grab them and
go have a pirate tea party!

10:36.135 --> 10:38.903
- More tea, little sea pups?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.573
We've got to head back
to Pirate Island.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.610
So long! Bye, Hook Family!

10:45.612 --> 10:49.180
Ta-ta.
Adorable popinjays.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.216
- [Skully] Bye, Mama.
- [Jake] See you!

10:54.186 --> 10:57.555
Mateys, thanks for joining us
on our treasure hunt today.

10:57.557 --> 10:59.624
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons

10:59.626 --> 11:02.327
and put 'em in our
Team Treasure Chest.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.636
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

11:11.638 --> 11:13.672
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

11:13.674 --> 11:15.707
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

11:15.709 --> 11:18.610
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

11:18.612 --> 11:20.645
Come on. Count with us.

11:21.747 --> 11:22.881
[all] Yeah!

11:24.216 --> 11:26.317
[Jake] One, two...

11:26.319 --> 11:28.620
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

11:28.622 --> 11:33.224
[Izzy] Six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.528
[Jake] Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

11:36.530 --> 11:39.364
we got ten gold doubloons.

11:39.366 --> 11:43.234
You know, Mama Hook sure
turned out to be awesome.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.403
Yeah, I hope Captain Hook
appreciates her

11:45.405 --> 11:46.871
as much as we do!

11:46.873 --> 11:51.376
Ah, what could be better than
a tea party on Never Land?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.245
James, sit up!
No slouching!

11:54.247 --> 11:58.316
That's simply not proper
behavior for a pirate captain.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.518
Yes, Mother, dear.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.387
Oh, by the way,
I've invited

12:02.389 --> 12:04.956
one more guest
to our little party.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.358
[stuttering] A guest?

12:08.327 --> 12:11.362
- [chuckling]
- [screams]

12:16.435 --> 12:19.337
<i>[Izzy]</i> Pixie Dust Away!

12:20.573 --> 12:22.741
Jake, Cubby. Wake up!

12:22.743 --> 12:28.012
- What's going on, Izzy?
- Fairy Rock is glowing!

12:28.014 --> 12:32.784
And that means
the fairies of Never Land
have a message for us.

12:37.723 --> 12:40.358
<i>¶ Won't you listen</i>
<i>to our fairy song? ¶</i>

12:40.360 --> 12:43.027
<i>¶ Use your pixie dust</i>
<i>all day long ¶</i>

12:43.029 --> 12:45.430
<i>¶ Now, let's fly</i>
<i>everyone ¶</i>

12:45.432 --> 12:48.366
¶ Use pixie dust just for fun

12:48.368 --> 12:54.272
<i>¶ It's Pixie Dust Away Day </i>

12:55.908 --> 12:58.042
It's a good thing I've
got plenty of pixie dust,

12:58.044 --> 13:01.346
- so we can fly all day.
- This is gonna be fun!

13:01.348 --> 13:03.915
- Let's go!
- [yelling out]

13:03.917 --> 13:05.483
Izzy!

13:06.886 --> 13:09.854
[gasps] Shiver me timbers!

13:11.791 --> 13:15.693
All my pixie dust is gone,
and it's all my fault.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.996
I've ruined
Pixie Dust Away Day.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.631
Crackers.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.735
- Well, it was an accident.
- Don't worry, Izz.

13:23.737 --> 13:26.905
I bet the fairies can
help us get more pixie dust.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.942
<i>¶ Listen carefully</i>
<i>to what we say ¶</i>

13:30.944 --> 13:33.945
<i>¶ To find pixie dust today </i>

13:33.947 --> 13:35.914
<i>¶ Take a ride</i>
<i>through Tiki Forest ¶</i>

13:35.916 --> 13:38.516
<i>¶ Then climb the Pixie Peak </i>

13:38.518 --> 13:40.785
<i>¶ You'll have to</i>
<i>work together ¶</i>

13:40.787 --> 13:43.721
¶ To find just what you seek!

13:43.723 --> 13:45.757
¶ In the Fountain Of Forever

13:45.759 --> 13:48.059
<i>¶ Pixie dust flows anew </i>

13:48.061 --> 13:50.395
<i>¶ It's a magical</i>
<i>pixie fountain ¶</i>

13:50.397 --> 13:53.498
¶ That we made just for you!

13:53.500 --> 13:56.968
Mateys, do you want to
help us find more pixie dust?

13:58.804 --> 14:02.907
Yay-hey! Remember to keep a
look out for gold doubloons.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.977
Whenever we solve
a pirate problem together,
they'll appear.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.614
Then we'll collect 'em and put
'em in our Team Treasure Chest.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.050
Yo-ho, let's go!

14:15.554 --> 14:18.356
<i>¶ Yo-ho, mateys away </i>

14:18.358 --> 14:20.992
<i>¶ There'll be treasure</i>
<i>and adventure today ¶</i>

14:20.994 --> 14:25.496
<i>¶ Heave ho, here we go</i>
<i>Together as a team ¶</i>

14:25.498 --> 14:28.766
<i>¶ Jake and the</i>
<i>Never Land Pirates ¶</i>

14:28.768 --> 14:30.602
<i>¶ And me </i>

14:33.672 --> 14:36.808
Blast! We've been looking
for treasure all day,

14:36.810 --> 14:39.077
and I haven't found
a single bauble,

14:39.079 --> 14:40.979
doubloon or piece of gold!

14:40.981 --> 14:43.915
I don't think I can
take another step.

14:43.917 --> 14:49.153
[wheezing] I know exactly what
you mean, cap'n, I surely do!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.023
[Cubby] Follow me,
everybody.

14:52.025 --> 14:57.095
It's those puniest of
puny pirates. Quick, hide!

14:57.097 --> 14:59.898
As long as we
stay on this path,

14:59.900 --> 15:02.100
we'll find the
Fountain of Forever.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.135
Good!
I hope we find it soon

15:04.137 --> 15:07.906
so I can get more pixie dust.
Without it, we can't fly,

15:07.908 --> 15:11.042
and you know how much
we need it for emergencies.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.878
Did you hear that, boys?

15:13.880 --> 15:17.982
Those scurvy swabs are looking
for that sparkly pixie dust

15:17.984 --> 15:19.584
that makes them fly!

15:19.586 --> 15:23.821
[laughing] If we had that
dusty stuff, we could fly.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.057
Follow the popinjays!

15:26.059 --> 15:29.894
- Ahoy, Tiki Trees!
- Greetings, friends!

15:29.896 --> 15:33.531
And how are my
favorite pirates today?

15:33.533 --> 15:35.967
Well, Mr. Tiki,
we're on our way to find

15:35.969 --> 15:39.437
the Fountain of Forever
to get more pixie dust.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.041
The fairies told us to
"Take a ride through
Tiki Forest!"

15:43.043 --> 15:45.510
So could you please
give us a ride?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.845
Sure t'ing, little lady!

15:47.847 --> 15:51.950
I t'ink my boys and I
can give you a little lift.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.218
[all exclaiming]

15:55.854 --> 15:57.655
- Yippee!
- All right!

15:57.657 --> 15:59.924
Yeah!

15:59.926 --> 16:01.993
Thanks for the ride,
Tiki Trees.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.996
[chuckling] You're welcome.

16:04.998 --> 16:08.900
Yay-hey! We got across
the forest fast,

16:08.902 --> 16:11.202
and we got two gold doubloons!

16:11.204 --> 16:15.673
Let's grab them and
go find pixie dust at
the Fountain of Forever.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.078
Come on, mateys!

16:20.080 --> 16:22.780
We're getting closer
to finding the Fountain.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.116
You sure?
I can hardly see anything.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.718
[Hook] Move it, men!

16:26.720 --> 16:29.087
Those popinjays
are way ahead of us!

16:29.089 --> 16:32.957
Ah, coconuts! Sounds like
Captain Hook is here.

16:34.593 --> 16:36.861
[Jake] It's old Feather Hat,
all right,

16:36.863 --> 16:38.563
and I bet I know what he wants.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.965
We can't let Hook find
the Fountain of Forever.

16:40.967 --> 16:44.502
I bet he'll try to take
all of our pixie dust,

16:44.504 --> 16:46.704
and if he does, we're sunk.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.040
OK, mates, here's the plan:

16:49.042 --> 16:51.275
We'll try to lose
Hook in the fog!

16:53.812 --> 16:55.546
Shiver me timbers.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.549
How can we find our way
through all this fog?

16:58.551 --> 16:59.984
I've got an idea!

16:59.986 --> 17:03.187
How about we fan away
the fog in front of us?

17:03.189 --> 17:07.058
I can use my map and
you can use your hands.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.961
And wings!
Let's do it!

17:09.963 --> 17:12.563
[all] Fan, fan, fan!

17:12.565 --> 17:15.233
All right!
We fanned the fog away.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.769
And we got three more
gold doubloons.

17:17.771 --> 17:21.839
- Let's grab 'em and go!
- Check this out, mates!

17:21.841 --> 17:23.608
I wonder if any
of these tunnels

17:23.610 --> 17:26.244
will take us to the
Fountain of Forever?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.146
[all] Whoa!

17:28.148 --> 17:30.915
<i>¶ Take this tunnel</i>
<i>the one that glows ¶</i>

17:30.917 --> 17:34.185
<i>¶ Take it to the place</i>
<i>where pixie dust flows! ¶</i>

17:34.187 --> 17:37.155
[Izzy] You heard
the fairies! Let's go!

17:40.192 --> 17:43.194
- Yay-hey!
- [Skully] Wow-wee!

17:43.196 --> 17:45.830
[Izzy] We found the
Fountain of Forever!

17:45.832 --> 17:49.100
Yo-ho, let's go
get pixie dust!

17:51.837 --> 17:53.638
[Hook] Step lively, boys.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.642
But, cap'n, might I point out
that this fog is a bit too...

17:57.644 --> 17:59.644
...well, uh, foggy?

17:59.646 --> 18:03.181
I am not going to let
a little fog stand in me...

18:03.183 --> 18:04.982
[grunting]

18:04.984 --> 18:07.819
[all yelling]

18:11.890 --> 18:14.058
[all shouting]

18:15.828 --> 18:17.995
Bilge water.

18:17.997 --> 18:22.266
All this blasted dusty stuff
is going to make me...

18:26.371 --> 18:29.140
[sneezes]

18:29.142 --> 18:32.343
Oh, my! Cap'n,
we're flying!

18:32.345 --> 18:36.247
I'm as free
as a bird!

18:36.249 --> 18:39.617
Look at me.
I'm a pixie, I am!

18:39.619 --> 18:44.088
Oh... So this is the
Fairies Fountain of Forever, eh?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.756
Ah-ha!

18:45.758 --> 18:49.760
Now I know where to get
all the pixie dust I want,

18:49.762 --> 18:52.763
whenever I want it.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.167
<i>¶ With sparkles in me eye</i>
<i>Look how I can fly ¶</i>

18:56.169 --> 18:58.102
<i>¶ We're pirates in the sky </i>

18:58.104 --> 19:00.771
<i>¶ Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my </i>

19:00.773 --> 19:03.241
¶ Loopy, loopy downside uppy

19:03.243 --> 19:06.110
<i>¶ Flappin' like</i>
<i>a flyin' guppy ¶</i>

19:06.112 --> 19:09.714
<i>¶ Pixie Dust away-hey! </i>

19:09.716 --> 19:11.382
I really messed up.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.285
If I would've never dropped
my pouch of pixie dust,

19:14.287 --> 19:16.287
none of this
would've ever happened.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.389
I gotta fix this!

19:18.391 --> 19:20.391
<i>¶ La dee da</i>
<i>La dee da ¶</i>

19:20.393 --> 19:25.830
Stop! Captain Hook, that pixie
dust does not belong to you.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.166
The fairies of Never Land
gave it to us!

19:28.168 --> 19:30.401
Oh, really?

19:30.403 --> 19:34.005
Sharky, Bones, shoo
these little pests away

19:34.007 --> 19:37.208
before I lose me... cool!

19:37.210 --> 19:40.011
We've got to get Hook
away from this place.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.880
We can't ever let him
find the fountain again.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.217
Follow me, everybody!
Let's jump in the fountain.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.789
- Yo-ho!
- Coconuts!

19:51.791 --> 19:53.958
- Pixie dust away!
- Way to fly!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.393
Blast!

19:55.395 --> 19:58.763
Those pirate pests
are getting the pixie dust!

19:58.765 --> 20:02.266
Can't I ever get me way,
just once?

20:02.268 --> 20:07.171
- Ahoy, Captain Hook!
- Hold still, lad.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.740
[grunting]
Stop trying to trick me!

20:09.742 --> 20:12.710
You know, Hook, you're
not bad for a beginner,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.446
but I bet you can't do this!

20:18.383 --> 20:21.319
Oh, yes, I can do that!

20:21.321 --> 20:23.221
[laughing] And more!

20:23.223 --> 20:25.223
Men, follow me!

20:25.225 --> 20:26.724
[laughing]

20:26.726 --> 20:29.460
You might need a few more
flying lessons, Hook.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.329
Fly faster, men!

20:31.331 --> 20:35.066
I must beat that
pompous pup at his own game.

20:38.203 --> 20:41.906
- This way, men!
- Are you sure, sir?

20:43.508 --> 20:46.210
[laughing] Captain Hook
will be so confused,

20:46.212 --> 20:49.814
he'll never find the
Fountain of Forever ever again.

20:53.285 --> 20:57.255
Mr. Smee? Where...
Where are we?

20:57.257 --> 20:59.991
We're miles away from
that fountain, cap'n!

20:59.993 --> 21:02.493
[sighing] I'm afraid
those smart sea pups

21:02.495 --> 21:07.465
- outsmarted us yet again.
- [groaning]

21:09.401 --> 21:11.936
Yo-ho! We chased
Captain Hook away

21:11.938 --> 21:13.804
from the
Fountain of Forever,

21:13.806 --> 21:16.540
and we got three more
gold doubloons.

21:16.542 --> 21:20.077
Let's grab them and go fly!

21:20.079 --> 21:22.513
<i>¶ Now, good luck</i>
<i>pirate friends ¶</i>

21:22.515 --> 21:24.915
<i>¶ You'll hear from us again </i>

21:24.917 --> 21:27.318
<i>¶ Now go enjoy the day </i>

21:27.320 --> 21:29.887
<i>¶ It's pixie dust away </i>

21:29.889 --> 21:32.456
<i>¶ It's Pixie Dust Away Day </i>

21:32.458 --> 21:34.992
[all laughing and cheering]

21:34.994 --> 21:37.928
I'm so glad to have
my pixie dust again!

21:37.930 --> 21:40.531
One pouch full,
that's all we need.

21:40.533 --> 21:44.568
From now on I'm gonna be
extra careful not to spill it.

21:44.570 --> 21:48.105
- It's way too important.
- [all laughing]

21:50.242 --> 21:53.344
Mateys, thanks for
helping me get my pixie dust.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.279
Now, let's count
our gold doubloons

21:55.281 --> 21:57.982
and put 'em in
Team Treasure Chest.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.092
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>Well done, crew ¶</i>

22:08.094 --> 22:10.127
<i>¶ Everyone knew</i>
<i>just what to do ¶</i>

22:10.129 --> 22:12.163
<i>¶ Way, hey</i>
<i>With help from you ¶</i>

22:12.165 --> 22:14.899
<i>¶ It's time to count</i>
<i>our gold doubloons! ¶</i>

22:14.901 --> 22:17.501
Come on. Count with us.

22:18.370 --> 22:20.004
[all] Yeah!

22:21.173 --> 22:23.140
[Izzy] One, two...

22:23.142 --> 22:25.343
[Cubby] Three, four, five...

22:25.345 --> 22:28.346
[Jake] Six, seven, eight!

22:28.348 --> 22:31.482
Yo, ho! For solving
pirate problems today,

22:31.484 --> 22:34.585
we got eight gold doubloons.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.922
Now let's celebrate
Pixie Dust Away Day.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.990
Pixie dust away!

22:39.992 --> 22:42.360
- [all cheering]
- [Jake] Yo-ho, way to go!

22:42.362 --> 22:44.362
- [Izzy] Yay-hey, yes way!
- [Cubby] Yippee!

22:50.469 --> 22:52.470
Mr. Smee,

22:52.472 --> 22:57.208
how long do you think this
flying dusty stuff lasts?

22:57.210 --> 23:03.080
- Oh, let's see. I'd say
till right about...
- [all screaming]

23:06.385 --> 23:07.551
[up-tempo rock plays]

23:07.553 --> 23:09.887
<i>¶ When I started my career </i>

23:09.889 --> 23:12.390
¶ As a jolly rocking pirateer

23:12.392 --> 23:14.525
<i>¶ A famous captain</i>
<i>just so happens ¶</i>

23:14.527 --> 23:16.494
<i>¶ Taught me everything </i>

23:18.130 --> 23:19.597
<i>¶ Always ready with a song </i>

23:19.599 --> 23:22.199
<i>¶ End up in the galley</i>
<i>right at dawn ¶</i>

23:22.201 --> 23:24.535
<i>¶ And when I want to</i>
<i>treasure hunt ¶</i>

23:24.537 --> 23:26.570
<i>¶ She always packs me lunch </i>

23:27.973 --> 23:29.540
¶ Such a savvy buccaneer

23:29.542 --> 23:32.410
<i>¶ Sewing up me pirate gear </i>

23:32.412 --> 23:36.447
<i>¶ Making batches</i>
<i>of me favorite treats ¶</i>

23:37.649 --> 23:39.917
<i>¶ Rowing every day</i>
<i>to school ¶</i>

23:39.919 --> 23:42.286
<i>¶ And teaching</i>
<i>golden pirate rules ¶</i>

23:42.288 --> 23:46.257
<i>¶ Like navigation</i>
<i>mathmication</i>
<i>and dog paddling ¶</i>

23:47.559 --> 23:49.660
