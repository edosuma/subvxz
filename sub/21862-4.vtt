<c.speakerTop>We have to judge
the Avalor Bake-Off later,

01:12.958 --> 01:14.708
<c.speakerTop>so I need to eat light.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.875
<c.speakerTop>Light, <i>abuelo? </i>Ha!
Not even Mateo

01:18.875 --> 01:21.375

<c.speakerTop>[chuckling]

01:22.250 --> 01:24.375
<c.speakerTop>-Good morning!
-[grunting]

01:25.416 --> 01:26.750
<c.speakerTop>Morning, family!

01:26.750 --> 01:29.125
<c.speakerTop>Good morning,
<i>mijita. </i>

01:29.125 --> 01:30.875
<c.speakerTop>You're in a good mood.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.708
<c.speaker>That's because Migs
is finally coming back

01:32.708 --> 01:34.416
<c.speaker>from his trip to Vallestrella.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.416
<c.speaker>And I hear he has
a big surprise!

01:37.416 --> 01:40.000
<c.speaker>-Ay. I <i>hate </i>surprises!
-Surprise!

01:40.000 --> 01:41.416
<c.speaker>Case in point.

01:41.416 --> 01:42.458
<c.speaker><i>Doña </i>Paloma!

01:42.458 --> 01:44.166
<c.speaker>What brings you by
so early?

01:44.166 --> 01:46.416
<c.speaker>Well, as Mistress of Ceremonies

01:46.416 --> 01:49.208
<c.speaker>for today's Bake-Off,
I need to make sure

01:49.208 --> 01:51.250
<c.speaker>everything is ready.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.625
<c.speaker>Even if Lady Yolanda
will almost surely

01:53.625 --> 01:54.708
<c.speaker>win it all again.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.375
<c.speaker>I don't know about that.

01:56.375 --> 01:57.583
<c.speaker>There's a new pastry chef

01:57.583 --> 01:59.000
<c.speaker>who could
shake things up this year.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.166
<c.speaker>[laughs]

02:00.166 --> 02:02.250
<c.speaker>And who, may I ask, is that?

02:02.250 --> 02:04.458
<c.speaker>Our very own Armando.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.833
<c.speaker>[all] Armando?!

02:05.833 --> 02:07.291
<c.speaker>Uh, you called?

02:07.291 --> 02:08.250
<c.speaker>You bake?

02:08.250 --> 02:10.875
<c.speaker>Oh. Yes. My <i>abuela </i>Josefina

02:10.875 --> 02:12.416
<c.speaker>taught me everything I know.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.500
<c.speaker>She's the reason
I'm entering the competition.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.583
<c.speaker>I want to make
my <i>abuelita </i>proud.

02:16.583 --> 02:18.875
<c.speaker>-Ugh!
-Oh, how sweet!

02:18.875 --> 02:20.125
<c.speaker>Oh...

02:20.125 --> 02:22.875
<c.speaker>I still remember
helping her bake cakes

02:22.875 --> 02:24.833
<c.speaker>for all the children
in our village.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.875
<c.speaker>And if the children
in your village

02:26.875 --> 02:28.375
<c.speaker>were judging the Bake-Off,

02:28.375 --> 02:31.125
<c.speaker>you would still lose
to Lady Yolanda.
[laughs]

02:31.125 --> 02:34.458
<c.speaker>No one speaks to Armando
like that but me!

02:34.458 --> 02:35.583
<c.speaker>[clears throat]

02:35.583 --> 02:37.958
<c.speaker>I hope you save
your appetite, eh?

02:37.958 --> 02:39.708
<c.speaker>Because you will be
eating your words

02:39.708 --> 02:41.833
<c.speaker>when Armando wins
the Bake-Off.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.583
<c.speaker>[laughs]
Oh, Esteban.

02:44.583 --> 02:47.291
<c.speaker>You may have had
the first laugh,
<i>Doña </i>Paloma,

02:47.291 --> 02:50.250
<c.speaker>but Armando
will have the last!

02:52.458 --> 02:55.875
<c.speaker>My goodness! This is
a work of art, Armando!

02:55.875 --> 02:57.708
<c.speaker>Well, thanks, Chancellor,

02:57.708 --> 03:00.500
<c.speaker>but I'm a little worried
about the frosting.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.875
<c.speaker>Oh, I'm sure
it's delicious.

03:04.458 --> 03:05.833
<c.speaker>[both gag]

03:05.833 --> 03:07.583
<c.speaker>Well? What do you think?

03:07.583 --> 03:09.583
<c.speaker>It needs a little, um...

03:09.583 --> 03:12.125
<c.speaker>Flavor. Taste.
Anything!

03:12.125 --> 03:13.833
<c.speaker>-Ohh!
-[bell rings]

03:13.833 --> 03:15.958
<c.speaker>Make way for my new invention--

03:15.958 --> 03:17.375
<c.speaker>the Bakery Bike.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.416
<c.speaker>[all gasp]

03:19.416 --> 03:20.500
<c.speaker>Oh!

03:20.500 --> 03:21.875
<c.speaker>[sighs]

03:21.875 --> 03:23.458
<c.speaker>Oh! Sorry, cousin.

03:23.458 --> 03:26.375
<c.speaker>I...guess the bike
could use a little tinkering.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.750
<c.speaker>Yes, well, please--
tinker someplace else.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.291
<c.speaker>The kitchen is no place

03:30.291 --> 03:32.458
<c.speaker>for children
and their toys!

03:32.458 --> 03:34.250
<c.speaker>[groans]

03:34.250 --> 03:37.875
<c.speaker>Um, let's go
to your room, Isa.
I'll help you.

03:37.875 --> 03:42.500
<c.speaker>Thanks...
but I can fix it myself.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.166
<c.speaker>[wheels squeak]

03:45.166 --> 03:48.125
<c.speaker>Hmph.
I am not a child!

03:48.125 --> 03:50.583
<c.speaker>I'm eleven years, three months,
and two days old.

03:50.583 --> 03:53.375
<c.speaker>And this is <i>not </i>a toy.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.625
<c.speaker>Isa! How's it--

03:54.625 --> 03:57.083
<c.speaker>Whoa! You really
fixed it up.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.708
<c.speaker>I figured adding doors
and a roof

03:58.708 --> 04:00.208
<c.speaker>would keep the pies
in place...

04:00.208 --> 04:02.500
<c.speaker>and out of Cousin Esteban's
mustache.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.500
<c.speaker>[Migs] I have returned!

04:04.500 --> 04:07.416
<c.speaker>Migs! Welcome back!

04:07.416 --> 04:09.583
<c.speaker>Princess Elena, Isabel,

04:09.583 --> 04:11.750
<c.speaker>I'd like you to meet...
Dulce.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.583
<c.speaker>My new mate.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.750
<c.speaker>[gasps] So this
was your big surprise.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.750
<c.speaker>Well, one of them.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.833
<c.speaker>Dulce and I
are going to be parents.

04:20.833 --> 04:24.000
<c.speaker>Ooh! Uh, sooner
than we thought.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.750
<c.speaker>[pained chuckle]
As in <i>now, </i>Migs.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.291
<c.speaker>Wait. What?!

04:28.291 --> 04:30.000
<c.speaker>-[groans]
-[thud]

04:32.583 --> 04:33.833
<c.speaker>Hmm.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.250
<c.speaker>[Migs] Three eggs?

04:35.250 --> 04:38.000
<c.speaker>That means...three babies!

04:38.000 --> 04:41.166
<c.speaker>Migs! Are you nervous
about becoming a dad?

04:41.166 --> 04:43.583
<c.speaker>Me, nervous?
Of course not.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.750
<c.speaker>I'm petrified!

04:44.750 --> 04:46.291
<c.speaker>Get a hold of yourself, Migs.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.166
<c.speaker>You're not doing it alone,
all right?

04:48.166 --> 04:49.625
<c.speaker>I'll be right by your side.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.250
<c.speaker>Thanks, Dulce.
I feel much better.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.416
<c.speaker>-Good. 'Cause I gotta go.
-What?!

04:54.416 --> 04:56.416
<c.speaker>I need to find
some anoki berries.

04:56.416 --> 04:57.750
<c.speaker>What are anoki berries?

04:57.750 --> 05:00.083
<c.speaker>That's what we feed
newborn jaquins.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.500
<c.speaker>They grow
all over Vallestrella,

05:02.500 --> 05:04.458
<c.speaker>but are hard
to find in Avalor,

05:04.458 --> 05:06.125
<c.speaker>so I gotta get searchin'.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.708
<c.speaker>B-B-But Dulce!

05:07.708 --> 05:10.291
<c.speaker>It'll be days
before the eggs hatch.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.458
<c.speaker>You'll be fine.

05:11.458 --> 05:13.625
<c.speaker>Hurry back!

05:13.625 --> 05:17.166
<c.speaker>Okay. I just have to
watch the eggs.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.500
<c.speaker>-[crackling]
-Ah! What's happening?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.875
<c.speaker>[crackling]

05:21.875 --> 05:23.958
<c.speaker>Well, I'm no expert,

05:23.958 --> 05:26.166
<c.speaker>but it looks like
they're starting to hatch.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.333
<c.speaker>Well, this is--
Oh, they can't!

05:28.333 --> 05:30.875
<c.speaker>I have to go tell Dulce
they're coming early!

05:30.875 --> 05:33.458
<c.speaker>Well, Migs, how long
does it take baby jaquins

05:33.458 --> 05:34.750
<c.speaker>to break out of their shells?

05:34.750 --> 05:36.625
<c.speaker>Usually about a day.

05:36.625 --> 05:38.500
<c.speaker>Oh, that's plenty of time!

05:38.500 --> 05:41.458
<c.speaker>Go find Dulce, and I'll have
one of the castle staff

05:41.458 --> 05:42.708
<c.speaker>come up and watch the eggs.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.500
<c.speaker>You don't need to do that.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.458
<c.speaker>I can watch the eggs.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.583
<c.speaker>I appreciate that, Princess,

05:48.583 --> 05:50.458
<c.speaker>but I don't know
if you're old enough.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.125
<c.speaker>Everyone keeps saying
I'm a kid!

05:54.125 --> 05:56.125
<c.speaker>Well, that's because
you are a kid.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.958
<c.speaker>But I'm old enough
to baby-sit.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.625
<c.speaker>Or...egg-sit.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.583

08:25.625 --> 08:28.875
<c.speaker>Hmm. I don't know
any baby jaquin games,

08:28.875 --> 08:31.166
<c.speaker>but I can teach you a fun game
I used to play.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.458
<c.speaker>-Game?
-Game?

<c.speaker>Shall we just declare you
the winner now?

09:49.625 --> 09:51.333
<c.speaker>Oh, please don't.

09:51.333 --> 09:52.958
<c.speaker>Half the fun of winning

like a cookie!

10:21.875 --> 10:24.500
<c.speaker>I needed those for
my Pyramid of Pastries!

<c.speaker>It wasn't my fault, Carmen!
There was a runaway princess!

10:31.416 --> 10:34.125
<c.speaker>Hey, Armando.
I think the Bake-Off
is starting.

10:34.125 --> 10:35.958
<c.speaker>[gasps] It is?!

10:35.958 --> 10:38.583
<c.speaker>Oh. I've been working
on the frosting all morning,

10:38.583 --> 10:39.958
<c.speaker>but it's still not right!

10:39.958 --> 10:42.000
<c.speaker>I know how you feel.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.958
<c.speaker>I've been working

10:45.958 --> 10:47.583
<c.speaker>Huh?

10:47.583 --> 10:49.708
<c.speaker>On the bright side,
I just figured out

10:49.708 --> 10:52.000
<c.speaker>how to make an apple
look like a gooseberry.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.958
<c.speaker>Oh. Gooseberries!

10:53.958 --> 10:55.833
<c.speaker>That's what
this frosting needs.

<c.speaker>I came down for a snack.

11:23.875 --> 11:25.708
<c.speaker>Hmm. That's some snack.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.875

11:29.416 --> 11:31.458
<c.speaker>Ooh. I must be hungrier

<c.speaker>and-and now they're gone,

17:03.208 --> 17:05.416
<c.speaker>and...the pink one's
a giant...

17:05.416 --> 17:08.583
<c.speaker>She drank some of
my enlarging potion.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.625
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, Elena.

17:10.625 --> 17:13.250
<c.speaker>[Luna] Help and food
have arrived!

17:13.250 --> 17:17.166
<c.speaker>We only found one, but...
maybe they could split it?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.875
<c.speaker>Or...

17:20.875 --> 17:23.958
<c.speaker>we could use the enlarging
potion on the Anoki berry

17:23.958 --> 17:26.625
<c.speaker>and make it big enough
to lure the baby jaquins
back to the palace.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.583
<c.speaker>That... sounds like
a great idea.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.250
<c.speaker>Mateo,
work your magic!

17:32.250 --> 17:33.583
<c.speaker>Pun intended.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.083
<c.speaker>Okay, stand back, everyone.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.750
<c.speaker>Oh!

17:40.750 --> 17:43.250
<c.speaker>All right. Now we just need
to find those babies.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.875
<c.speaker>Right after Mateo
unfreezes <i>Doña </i>Paloma.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.583
<c.speaker>Let us not be
too hasty.

17:47.583 --> 17:50.875
<c.speaker>She does make
an excellent
ice sculpture.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.166
<c.speaker>[distant laughter]

17:58.083 --> 18:00.708
<c.speaker>Fly up! They need to see
the Anoki berry!

18:00.708 --> 18:02.291
<c.speaker>You got it, Princessa!

18:03.708 --> 18:04.875
<c.speaker>[Skylar]
Hey, kids!

18:04.875 --> 18:05.875
<c.speaker>[all gasp]

18:05.875 --> 18:08.125
<c.speaker>Come and get it!

18:08.125 --> 18:09.708
<c.speaker>Anoki!

18:09.708 --> 18:11.333
<c.speaker>-Anoki!
-Anoki!

18:11.333 --> 18:14.500
<c.speaker>-Anoki! Anoki!
-Anoki! Anoki!

18:14.500 --> 18:17.083
<c.speaker>All right.
Let's get them
back to the palace.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.458
<c.speaker>-Anoki!
-Incoming!

18:26.458 --> 18:28.375
<c.speaker>[all] Anoki!

18:28.375 --> 18:29.416
<c.speaker>[all gasp]

18:30.708 --> 18:31.875
<c.speaker>Ohh!

18:31.875 --> 18:33.458
<c.speaker>Why, why, why?!

18:36.458 --> 18:38.291
<c.speaker>Hmm. Not too tart,

18:38.291 --> 18:40.375
<c.speaker>not too sweet, and--

18:40.375 --> 18:41.458
<c.speaker>Just what I need!

18:44.333 --> 18:45.333
<c.speaker>[both] Anoki! Anoki!

18:47.708 --> 18:50.125
<c.speaker>Hey, Pinky! Catch!

18:51.208 --> 18:52.958
<c.speaker>Yuck! Pleahh!

18:52.958 --> 18:55.458
<c.speaker>Ooh! Oh, come <i>on! </i>

18:55.458 --> 18:57.625
<c.speaker>Why did you do that?
They don't like apples.

18:57.625 --> 19:00.083
<c.speaker>That apple was dipped
in my reversal potion.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.000
<c.speaker>She only needs to taste it
for it to work.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.875
<c.speaker>Whew.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.208
<c.speaker>[meows]

19:07.250 --> 19:09.375
<c.speaker>[meows]

19:10.416 --> 19:13.000
<c.speaker>-[both gasp]
-My babies hatched?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.375
<c.speaker>Come to Mommy!

19:15.375 --> 19:17.500
<c.speaker>I'm a dad! Cool!

19:17.500 --> 19:19.875
<c.speaker>[Migs chuckling]

19:19.875 --> 19:22.166
<c.speaker>Huh? Wait, where--

19:22.166 --> 19:23.375
<c.speaker>[laughs]

19:23.375 --> 19:25.833
<c.speaker>Hey, we gotta
name these guys.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.708
<c.speaker>Well, this one
is my little Estrella.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.416
<c.speaker>I think
we'll name you Zoom.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.000
<c.speaker>-Mommy?
-[giggles] No.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.500
<c.speaker>I'm Isa. Remember?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.416
<c.speaker>That's your mommy.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.000
<c.speaker>I think since that one
likes you so much,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.583
<c.speaker><i>you </i>should name him.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.875
<c.speaker>Really? Okay!

19:43.875 --> 19:46.208
<c.speaker>I'll name you...Mingo.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.333
<c.speaker>Mingo! Mingo!

19:48.333 --> 19:50.375
<c.speaker>-[giggles] Okay.
-[purrs]

19:50.375 --> 19:53.208
<c.speaker>Now go to
your mommy and daddy, Mingo.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.583
<c.speaker>-[meowing]
-[laughing]

19:58.375 --> 20:01.166
<c.speaker>You may not be
totally grown up just yet,

20:01.166 --> 20:04.375
<c.speaker>but your big idea
saved the day.

20:04.375 --> 20:08.000
<c.speaker>Is this a petting zoo
or a baking competition?

20:08.000 --> 20:10.458
<c.speaker>Can we get on with naming
Lady Yolanda the winner?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.708
<c.speaker>Excuse me. Hi.

20:12.708 --> 20:16.375
<c.speaker>Excuse me, but you haven't
tasted <i>my </i>cake yet. Heh.

20:18.458 --> 20:20.708
<c.speaker>Mmm. Mmm!

20:20.708 --> 20:22.375
<c.speaker>Is it terrible?

20:22.375 --> 20:23.958
<c.speaker>It's delicious!

20:23.958 --> 20:26.000
<c.speaker>I love it!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.458
<c.speaker>It's the best dessert
I've had all day.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.333
<c.speaker>Th-This cannot be!

20:32.875 --> 20:35.500
<c.speaker>It is...
very good.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.208
<c.speaker>So, do we have a winner?

20:38.208 --> 20:39.458
<c.speaker>Arggh.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.875
<c.speaker>[clears throat]

20:45.875 --> 20:48.166
<c.speaker>It is my... duty

20:48.166 --> 20:51.708
<c.speaker>to announce that the winner
of the Avalor Bake-Off is...

20:51.708 --> 20:53.500
<c.speaker>[sighs]

20:53.500 --> 20:55.708
<c.speaker>-...Chef Armando.
-Yes!

20:55.708 --> 20:59.125
<c.speaker>-[applause]
-Ohh!
-[thud]

21:01.208 --> 21:04.250
<c.speaker>Your <i>abuelita  </i>
would be very proud.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.208
<c.speaker>-[applause]
-[woman] Bravo!

21:06.208 --> 21:10.458
<c.speaker>-[overlapping speech]
<i>-...delicioso! </i>

21:10.458 --> 21:13.875
<c.speaker>And what was
in that frosting,
Armando?

21:13.875 --> 21:16.958
<c.speaker>It was so, uh, um, unusual.

21:16.958 --> 21:20.958
<c.speaker>-Yes. The secret
ingredient was--
-[Esteban] Anoki berry.

21:20.958 --> 21:24.291
<c.speaker>I should know. I have been
doused in it all afternoon.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.583
<c.speaker>Well done, Armando.

21:25.583 --> 21:26.750
<c.speaker>Well done.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.458
<c.speaker>Let me help you
with that.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.291
<c.speaker>[grunting]

21:33.291 --> 21:34.625
<c.speaker>Thanks, cousin.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.750
<c.speaker>Well, it is a good invention.

<i>Tortillitas. </i>

21:39.625 --> 21:41.416
<c.speaker><i>Tortillitas. </i>

21:41.416 --> 21:44.458
<c.speaker>I'm gonna go play with
the baby jaquins!

21:44.458 --> 21:46.291
<c.speaker>Paws up!
