This is taking a long time.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.312
Well, they did hack my entire server.

- Um...

01:43.237 --> 01:44.236
Hello.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.971
Are your parents home?

01:48.175 --> 01:49.842
Mmm, no. Sorry.

01:49.910 --> 01:50.976

01:51.045 --> 01:52.845

Oh, excuse me.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.515

says she's here to pick up Evie.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.499
Nope, it's not me.

02:13.567 --> 02:16.135
Well, we're gonna need to
work on your hiding skills.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.136
Do you know who she is?

02:17.204 --> 02:18.704
Yes.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.072
Can you tell us?

02:20.141 --> 02:21.073
No.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.841
I'd probably go with camouflage.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.810
If you're hiding in a bedroom,
I would go with something like

02:24.879 --> 02:28.046
sheets or a blanket so you
blend in, and also, you probably

02:28.115 --> 02:29.414
shouldn't talk while you're hiding.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.083
She's not gonna take you, Evie.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.151
Jake will send her away.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.153
But you have to tell us who she is.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.057
You're new here, aren't you?

02:39.126 --> 02:41.193
Not really. Why?

02:41.262 --> 02:44.029
Because otherwise you
would have known who I am.

02:44.098 --> 02:48.133
All the other kids
called me Lovely Lucia.

02:48.202 --> 02:51.603
Uh, that's funny, 'cause I've
never heard them mention you.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.138

you go look in the museum?

03:00.981 --> 03:04.616
You'll see a painting that my
deceased husband and I donated.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.685
Which one?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.953
The one with the stuffy old man

03:08.022 --> 03:09.788
who looks like he
smelled something foul.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.957
Mm. That could be any of them.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.325
Yes.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.960
But in this one, he's holding a goat.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.730
Go on, check it out.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.699
Okay. Wait here.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.267
Okay.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.542
Wait! There's no little goat
on any of these paintings!

03:31.745 --> 03:33.011
Wha...?!

03:33.080 --> 03:35.547
(LUCIA) Evie!

03:35.616 --> 03:36.915
I'm not here!

03:36.984 --> 03:38.450
Maybe don't say it out loud!

03:41.222 --> 03:43.222
I'm here to take you home!

03:43.290 --> 03:46.625
Hey! You just...

03:46.694 --> 03:49.027
Dear child.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.596
I have come to take you home, let's go.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.564
She's not here! She's not here!

03:52.633 --> 03:53.899
What? That's absurd.

03:53.968 --> 03:56.201
She's right there, I can see her.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.104
Well, she's really bad at hiding, so.

03:59.173 --> 04:01.640
Evie, come on, darling.
It's time to go home now.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.342
<i>She is home.</i>

04:04.511 --> 04:06.478
She is not.

04:06.547 --> 04:07.813
And neither are the rest of you.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.649
You're just staying here, like guests.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.451
You're not a real family.

04:12.519 --> 04:13.585
That's a lie.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.654
<i>We are a real family.</i>

04:15.723 --> 04:17.422
Evie, darling, you
don't have to live here

04:17.491 --> 04:19.658
any longer with that thief.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.159

04:23.697 --> 04:25.697
Don't even think about it.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.767
Oh, Eric, it's great that you're here.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.737
I just came by to see if darling
Evie has everything she needs.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.171
She does.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.307
Now please leave. You
have no right to be here.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.242
Evie is my stepchild,
I have every right to.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.478
<i>She was your stepchild.</i>

04:39.546 --> 04:41.880
Others have been taking care
of her for the last few months.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.517
I know what you want.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.387
And it's not going to happen.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.454
Now leave.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.760
Don't forget.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.362
<i>You are only half a Hunter.</i>

05:07.508 --> 05:09.875
Oh, good thing I forgot my wallet.

- (TESS) Who was that?
- Don't worry about it.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.644
She won't bother us again.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.879
That's all you need to know.

05:13.947 --> 05:15.914
Hey, Evie.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.482
Are you okay?

05:17.551 --> 05:19.484
I don't want to go with her.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.320
Oh, you don't have to, sweetie.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.721
Everything's gonna be all right.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.157
Here you go.

05:25.225 --> 05:28.460
Kate is waiting for me at the
grocery store, so I have to run.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.495
Don't let any other
strangers into the house.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.563
Wait! Eric!

05:34.468 --> 05:37.436
Why won't he tell us what's
going on, or anything?

05:37.504 --> 05:39.838
I don't know. What should we do?

05:39.907 --> 05:42.341
We have to figure out what's going on.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.910
We're gonna help Eric even
if he doesn't want us to.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.281
Sal? Yep, almost there.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.249
Sal, we need you now.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.951
Give me one second, okay?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.186
And...

05:54.254 --> 05:56.254
(TAPS KEY) ...done.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.423
That's it? Yep.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.858
And?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.226
And what?

06:01.295 --> 06:02.928
Did you find out who
hacked your computer?

06:02.996 --> 06:04.796
Nope, not a clue.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.600
We need to talk.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.801
All of us.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.404
Right. So here's what we know.

06:12.473 --> 06:16.875
First, there was the cryptex,
that I ingeniously opened.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.779
There was a picture of a crown inside.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.248
Next thing we know, Eric gets framed

06:23.317 --> 06:26.218
for stealing a puzzle box,

06:26.286 --> 06:29.921
and when we opened this puzzle
box, we found, yet again,

06:29.990 --> 06:31.523
another picture.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.426
While this is all going
on, Max gets introduced

06:34.495 --> 06:37.329
to his birth parents
by an agency that seems

06:37.398 --> 06:39.498
to have gone up in smoke.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.200
Don't forget the fake policeman
who went up in smoke as well.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.504
Thank you, Tess, for
pointing that out, yes.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.705
Policeman.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.608
And on top of that, Evie shows up.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.776
Yay!

06:50.844 --> 06:51.943
Evie.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.980
And around her neck,
she has the same crown

06:55.048 --> 06:56.882
as the one in the cryptex!

06:58.619 --> 06:59.718
You guys with me so far?

07:01.288 --> 07:04.222
Okay. This takes us to when Sal

07:04.291 --> 07:06.258
gets his computer hacked

07:06.326 --> 07:07.959
and the only thing that shows up...

07:08.028 --> 07:11.062
For the record, they
were world class hackers.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.032
Yeah, yeah, well, the
only thing that showed up

07:14.101 --> 07:17.936
was this strange sun.

07:18.005 --> 07:23.542
And then finally, this really weird lady

07:23.610 --> 07:26.445
who was Evie's stepmom shows up.

07:28.715 --> 07:32.851
So what does all of this mean?

07:40.027 --> 07:44.930
It tells us that it is
all very complicated.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.732
Way to go, detective.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.201
But we can solve this mystery.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.602
We can, I'm sure of it.

07:50.671 --> 07:54.806
We just have to follow the pattern.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.776
Now, I know...

07:57.845 --> 08:01.213
I know I wasn't around for
your last big adventure.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.250
But maybe I can still help out.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.587
Lucia was just pushing
your buttons, Jake.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.789
You're 100% Hunter.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.558
You know, don't let her get to you.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.027
I won't.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.664
Anyway, let's start
with our first witness.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.876
A bowl of ice cream, as requested.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.044
I still don't see how
this is gonna help, Nika.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.546
She's the star witness.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.948
She gets whatever she wants.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.751
Then how come you get a
bowl of ice cream, too?

08:39.820 --> 08:42.486
Because I'm the star questioner.

08:42.556 --> 08:45.490
Okay. Well, then,
start asking questions.

08:45.559 --> 08:48.426
So, that was your stepmom, Evie?

08:48.495 --> 08:50.228
Yes.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.163
And her name is Lucia?

08:52.232 --> 08:53.164
Yes.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.906
Your witness.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.507
All right, well, um...

09:02.576 --> 09:03.775
Do you know how she knows Eric?

09:03.844 --> 09:04.943
Nuh-uh.

09:05.012 --> 09:05.944
Do you know where she lives?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.280
Does she live in the same house as you?

09:08.348 --> 09:09.614
Long ago.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.383
Me and Daddy moved to a different house.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.685
Ah, but do you remember
where the house is,

09:13.754 --> 09:15.487
where you lived together with Lucia?

09:21.995 --> 09:22.928
No.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.999
But I do know that outside
the house is a river.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.000
A river!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.402
Oh, you mean like a canal.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.138
No, like a real river.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.706
I think I know what she's talking about!

09:34.775 --> 09:36.141
What? What?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.876
Mmm. Brain freeze.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.180
I think I know what she's talking about!

09:44.952 --> 09:46.384
So... Is this it?

09:47.888 --> 09:48.920
How did you...

09:48.989 --> 09:51.022
Amsterdam was built
near the Amstel River.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.657
That's how it got its name.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.926
What? I like history, okay?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.795
Okay, um, so...

09:56.863 --> 09:59.130
- how long is this river? Because...
- I have no idea.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.600
(SAL) 19 miles, ooh, that's long.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.834
How are we gonna find that?

10:02.903 --> 10:04.836
