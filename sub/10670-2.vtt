WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:03.771
>> KENDALL: Her name in my phone

00:03.771 --> 00:04.772
is "Mad."

00:04.772 --> 00:05.773
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

00:05.773 --> 00:06.774
>> KENDALL: 'Cause she's a

00:06.774 --> 00:07.775
little mad.

00:07.775 --> 00:08.776
>> KYLIE: Yeah.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.044
(laughter)

00:10.044 --> 00:11.845
>> CAITLYN: Road trip, baby.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.547
>> CANDIS: Wow!

00:13.547 --> 00:14.782
>> JENNY: This bus trip was

00:14.782 --> 00:16.450
Caitlyn's idea.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.918
She thought it was gonna be fun.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.621
(cheering)

00:20.621 --> 00:22.256
She needs to realize that she's

00:22.256 --> 00:24.825
not gonna get a pass anymore.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.826
>> CAITLYN: Democratic National

00:25.826 --> 00:26.860
Debate.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.928
>> CHANDI: Right. We're so

00:27.928 --> 00:29.197
excited that Cait's even gonna

00:29.197 --> 00:30.198
go.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.199
>> CANDIS: I'm excited for Cait.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.200
>> CHANDI: Right. And sit and

00:32.200 --> 00:33.201
listen to the Democrats.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.202
>> CAITLYN: It's the last place

00:34.202 --> 00:35.203
I want to be.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.204
>> CHANDI: I know. I know.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.205
>> CAITLYN: They're all

00:37.205 --> 00:38.206
Democrats.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.540
I'm the only conservative

00:39.540 --> 00:41.709
Republican on the bus.

00:41.709 --> 00:44.178
We're 18 and a half trillion

00:44.178 --> 00:45.346
dollars in debt.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.547
Our economy is going to

00:46.547 --> 00:48.282
collapse.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.317
(Candis sighs)

00:49.317 --> 00:50.484
The Democrats are destroying the

00:50.484 --> 00:51.852
country.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.721
>> KATE: Oh, dear.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.755
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.023
>> JENNY: I do not want to argue

00:56.023 --> 00:57.525
about the government from here

00:57.525 --> 00:58.859
to San... to Santa Fe.

00:58.859 --> 00:59.893
The stakes are very high.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.963
If she doesn't listen to the

01:02.963 --> 01:04.132
rest of the community, I think

01:04.132 --> 01:05.133
she's gonna find herself

01:05.133 --> 01:09.137
isolated and irrelevant.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.038
*

01:22.350 --> 01:24.318
(steady wiping)

01:33.627 --> 01:35.596
(music playing faintly)

01:48.909 --> 01:52.180
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

01:52.180 --> 01:54.915
We made it to New Mexico, the

01:54.915 --> 01:58.852
Land of Enchantment.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.021
Whatever that means.

02:01.021 --> 02:02.055
(Kip laughs)

02:02.055 --> 02:03.557
Um, yeah, m... And where's

02:03.557 --> 02:04.558
everybody?

02:04.558 --> 02:05.559
They're in the back.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.594
After all the political talk,

02:06.594 --> 02:07.595
they went to the back and went

02:07.595 --> 02:08.596
to sleep.

02:08.596 --> 02:09.597
>> KIP: It tuckered 'em out.

02:09.597 --> 02:10.598
>> CAITLYN: I think I just...

02:10.598 --> 02:12.400
Yeah. Put 'em right to sleep.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.368
(Kip laughs)

02:20.208 --> 02:21.842
>> CANDIS: (sighs) It just

02:21.842 --> 02:23.311
frustrates me sometimes.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.579
But at the end of the day, I

02:25.579 --> 02:28.316
realize that, like, we have a

02:28.316 --> 02:30.218
lot of differences.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.552
But this trip is gonna help

02:31.552 --> 02:33.954
girls that are coming up and

02:33.954 --> 02:36.089
seeing all of us together.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.993
And somebody, like, of your age

02:39.993 --> 02:41.595
can learn a lot from all of us

02:41.595 --> 02:42.596
women.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.332
>> ELLA: Yeah. I'm definitely at

02:44.332 --> 02:45.933
an age where I am soaking

02:45.933 --> 02:46.934
everything up.

02:46.934 --> 02:47.935
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.237
>> ELLA: Definitely. Yeah.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.604
You know, just graduating high

02:50.604 --> 02:52.139
school, I definitely feel like I

02:52.139 --> 02:55.576
am getting more than an

02:55.576 --> 02:57.144
abundance of education from all

02:57.144 --> 02:59.247
the women about our issues and,

02:59.247 --> 03:01.349
um, politically as well.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.350
>> CANDIS: Who do people tell

03:02.350 --> 03:03.351
you you look like?

03:03.351 --> 03:04.352
>> ELLA: Who do you think I look

03:04.352 --> 03:05.353
like?

03:05.353 --> 03:06.354
>> CANDIS: Natalie Portman.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.355
>> ELLA: It's weird, 'cause my

03:07.355 --> 03:08.489
whole family, they all look like

03:08.489 --> 03:09.957
Natalie Portman.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.259
It's-it's really strange.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.594
You remind me of a really

03:13.594 --> 03:15.463
gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous

03:15.463 --> 03:16.464
actress.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.498
Candis Cayne.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.032
That's who you remind me of.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.568
>> CANDIS: Stop it.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.635
(Ella laughs)

03:21.635 --> 03:22.636
Stop.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.637
>> ELLA: There goes Candis with

03:23.637 --> 03:24.638
her hair.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.274
(Candis laughs)

03:26.274 --> 03:28.276
(Ella chuckles)

03:31.044 --> 03:32.280
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, the

03:32.280 --> 03:34.282
bathroom smells so bad, but I

03:34.282 --> 03:36.684
really have to pee.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.786
Ooh, that is so bad.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.154
Jesus Christ!

03:41.154 --> 03:43.824
Oh, my God, that's awful!

03:43.824 --> 03:44.858
(laughter)

03:44.858 --> 03:45.926
Ugh!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.328
>> CHANDI: The bus is totally

03:47.328 --> 03:49.863
great, although the bathroom

03:49.863 --> 03:51.399
doesn't smell that great.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.866
>> ELLA: The sewage isn't really

03:52.866 --> 03:55.035
working that well, so it smells

03:55.035 --> 03:56.770
like a...

03:56.770 --> 03:58.506
(Candis coughing)

03:58.506 --> 04:00.107
...a cow farm.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.175
>> CANDIS: Jesus.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.644
>> KATE: The bathroom on the

04:03.644 --> 04:06.780
bus, goodness, goodness,

04:06.780 --> 04:10.351
goodness.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.320
(exhales)

04:12.320 --> 04:13.654
>> CANDIS: Oh.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.655
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.990
>> CANDIS: (laughs) Excuse me!

04:16.990 --> 04:18.626
You got a lot of nerve callin'

04:18.626 --> 04:20.428
me out!

04:20.428 --> 04:23.831
No privacy in this damn bus.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.098
It's like...

04:25.098 --> 04:26.467
Oh.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.370
Oh, my God, that is hideous.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.704
>> ELLA: Okay, but let me go.

04:30.704 --> 04:31.972
>> CANDIS: Good luck.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.974
(spraying)

04:33.974 --> 04:34.975
Really?

04:34.975 --> 04:35.976
>> KATE: We have been room

04:35.976 --> 04:36.977
freshened.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.045
>> CHANDI: Right. You smell

04:38.045 --> 04:39.647
mangos and peaches.

04:39.647 --> 04:40.648
(laughter)

04:40.648 --> 04:41.982
>> CANDIS: Oh, that is so bad up

04:41.982 --> 04:42.983
in that.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.919
Oh, Jesus Christ!

04:45.919 --> 04:48.856
That is one wrong bathroom.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.824
(laughter)

04:54.762 --> 04:57.130
>> KATE: Courtney, question,

04:57.130 --> 04:58.699
"tranny" has been around as a

04:58.699 --> 05:00.067
word since the '70s.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.234
>> COURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

05:01.234 --> 05:02.235
>> KATE: I don't call myself a

05:02.235 --> 05:03.737
woman; I do call myself a

05:03.737 --> 05:04.772
tranny.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.708
And transgender women have a lot

05:07.708 --> 05:09.677
of problems with that.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.944
>> COURTNEY: So it used to be an

05:10.944 --> 05:12.446
acceptable term?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.447
>> KATE: "Tranny" was a family

05:13.447 --> 05:14.448
word.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.449
>> COURTNEY: But now that's,

05:15.449 --> 05:16.450
like, derogatory.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.585
>> KIP: Is that... So is it okay

05:17.585 --> 05:19.119
between trans women to still use

05:19.119 --> 05:20.621
that word?

05:20.621 --> 05:21.689
Or it's just better not to say

05:21.689 --> 05:22.690
it?

05:22.690 --> 05:23.957
>> KATE: No. No.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.626
I don't think so.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.661
The people who object to the

05:27.661 --> 05:30.297
word "tranny" are people who...

05:30.297 --> 05:32.733
are very invested in being

05:32.733 --> 05:34.868
women, not trans folk.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.303
>> COURTNEY: Even some trans

05:36.303 --> 05:37.304
women think that word's

05:37.304 --> 05:38.305
offensive, even for them to use

05:38.305 --> 05:39.306
as well.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.307
>> JENNY: And I would... I would

05:40.307 --> 05:41.308
be one of them.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.309
>> COURTNEY: Yeah.

05:42.309 --> 05:43.310
>> JENNY: Kate and I have known

05:43.310 --> 05:44.578
each other for decades.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.813
I've taught her books even

05:45.813 --> 05:47.715
before I came out.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.583
I taught, um, Gender Outlaw.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.218
You know, I've been a fan of her

05:51.218 --> 05:53.120
work forever, but we see things

05:53.120 --> 05:54.422
very differently.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.523
If I hear that word, I will

05:55.523 --> 05:56.924
generally leave the room.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.659
I find it really hurtful.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.694
And I recognize that there are

06:00.694 --> 06:02.029
other people who own that word

06:02.029 --> 06:03.497
proudly, and that is fantastic

06:03.497 --> 06:04.665
for them.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.234
Um, it's not fantastic for me.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.936
For me, it is like-like saying

06:08.936 --> 06:11.439
the F-word to a-a gay man or the

06:11.439 --> 06:13.507
N-word to-to a person of color.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.808
It's a word I associate with

06:14.808 --> 06:16.844
beatings, being diminished,

06:16.844 --> 06:17.845
being on the receiving end of

06:17.845 --> 06:18.846
violence.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.847
>> KATE: Did you have an

06:19.847 --> 06:20.848
experience?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.182
Were you attacked and-and yelled

06:22.182 --> 06:23.817
at and hurt?

06:23.817 --> 06:24.952
I'm so sorry, baby.

06:24.952 --> 06:25.953
>> JENNY: Yeah, more than once.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.020
>> CHANDI: Yeah. I'm sorry about

06:27.020 --> 06:28.355
your experience, too.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.825
>> JENNY: Somebody, um... uh,

06:31.825 --> 06:34.462
uh, grabbed me by the neck, used

06:34.462 --> 06:36.163
that word, um, and other words,

06:36.163 --> 06:40.834
dragged me around, um, you know,

06:40.834 --> 06:42.503
by my neck for about a half an

06:42.503 --> 06:45.305
hour and finally dropped me.

06:45.305 --> 06:47.174
And I lay there on the ground,

06:47.174 --> 06:49.209
kind of unable to move.

06:49.209 --> 06:53.380
Words can hurt as much as... um,

06:53.380 --> 06:54.482
violence can.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.616
For-for me, it's still a

06:55.616 --> 06:56.617
triggering word.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.618
>> KATE: We-we developed the

06:57.618 --> 06:58.952
word "tranny" ourselves.

06:58.952 --> 06:59.953
>> JENNY: Yeah, I'm not sure the

06:59.953 --> 07:01.221
guys who were beating me up

07:01.221 --> 07:02.490
thought of it in those terms.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.491
>> KATE: No. Our word got

07:03.491 --> 07:04.492
stolen.

07:04.492 --> 07:06.126
We are using it in the way we've

07:06.126 --> 07:07.828
always used it, with love and

07:07.828 --> 07:09.096
respect.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.198
And you need to hear the love

07:11.198 --> 07:12.733
and respect in my voice when I

07:12.733 --> 07:14.502
say the word casually and you

07:14.502 --> 07:15.536
happen to hear it.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.537
>> JENNY: And I hope you know

07:16.537 --> 07:17.705
you're asking a lot.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.940
For me, Kate.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.341
That's-that's not an easy thing

07:21.341 --> 07:22.409
for me to do.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.812
>> KATE: Ask a lot from me.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.814
Yes, I know I'm asking a lot.

07:26.814 --> 07:29.416
It's my name.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.585
It's who I am.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.522
It's-it's the love I have for my

07:34.522 --> 07:38.626
queer, queer trans family.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.093
>> JENNY: And I love you, but

07:40.093 --> 07:41.629
it's not my name.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.130
>> KATE: Oh, I get that.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.431
I get that.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.833
>> CAITLYN: I'm, you know,

07:45.833 --> 07:46.967
obviously new to the community.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.335
I heard a lot of people call it,

07:48.335 --> 07:50.203
in the past, "tranny" or this or

07:50.203 --> 07:51.238
that.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.305
Fortunately, I had never

07:52.305 --> 07:53.541
developed the habit, so it was

07:53.541 --> 07:55.008
easy to change.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.377
Jenny Boylan, Kate Bornstein

07:57.377 --> 07:58.746
look at this issue very

07:58.746 --> 07:59.947
differently.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.348
They've both written books on

08:01.348 --> 08:02.349
it.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.851
They're both very smart.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.352
And so for me, it's great,

08:05.352 --> 08:06.386
'cause I love taking a little

08:06.386 --> 08:07.387
bit here, taking a little bit

08:07.387 --> 08:08.388
there, put it in my little

08:08.388 --> 08:09.857
computer in my head, and find

08:09.857 --> 08:11.358
out what works for me.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.226
>> KATE: We're on the same side

08:13.226 --> 08:15.228
but a totally different track.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.564
>> ELLA: I think that's-that's

08:16.564 --> 08:17.565
evident, but...

08:17.565 --> 08:18.566
>> JENNY: You think... Is it

08:18.566 --> 08:19.567
evident?

08:19.567 --> 08:20.568
I don't... I don't think of

08:20.568 --> 08:22.235
myself as being really so far

08:22.235 --> 08:23.336
from-from Kate, but I think that

08:23.336 --> 08:24.337
we...

08:24.337 --> 08:25.338
>> ELLA: No, you guys are very

08:25.338 --> 08:26.339
alike.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.008
I think you both are so

08:28.008 --> 08:30.010
intellectually on the same

08:30.010 --> 08:31.144
level...

08:31.144 --> 08:32.846
>> JENNY: Well, we're both...

08:32.846 --> 08:33.847
we're both brilliant.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.683
>> ELLA: Kate, I love her

08:35.683 --> 08:37.450
freedom.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.052
And she has this perspective

08:39.052 --> 08:42.389
that can sometimes be dangerous

08:42.389 --> 08:45.058
territory, especially for Jenny.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.126
>> JENNY: I think that Kate

08:46.126 --> 08:48.896
celebrates people who don't fit

08:48.896 --> 08:51.398
into any... compartment, and

08:51.398 --> 08:52.432
particularly binary

08:52.432 --> 08:53.466
compartments.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.803
I don't think of myself as an

08:55.803 --> 08:57.671
outlaw because of my gender.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.839
And my identity as a woman is

08:58.839 --> 09:02.175
a... is much more important to

09:02.175 --> 09:05.278
me than my identity as-as a

09:05.278 --> 09:07.114
trans woman.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.181
>> KATE: I think what I opened

09:08.181 --> 09:10.818
the doors to is my notion that

09:10.818 --> 09:13.153
gender is more than two.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.187
>> JENNY: Yeah.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.956
>> KATE: And gender doesn't rely

09:15.956 --> 09:19.693
on anatomy or biology.

09:19.693 --> 09:23.196
When I let my hair down, I'm...

09:23.196 --> 09:25.733
you know, tranny this, tranny

09:25.733 --> 09:27.801
that, let's go, trannies!

09:27.801 --> 09:30.370
And I don't, to this day, claim

09:30.370 --> 09:32.305
to be a woman.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.241
And this is where we kind of

09:34.241 --> 09:35.909
differ, because as far as I

09:35.909 --> 09:38.278
know, I'm the not-man-not-woman

09:38.278 --> 09:40.247
on this bus.

09:43.550 --> 09:47.020
I identify myself as a non-

09:47.020 --> 09:49.322
binary trans person.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.092
I call myself a tranny.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.428
I've been a tranny for 30 years.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.064
If you want me as part of your

09:57.064 --> 09:59.532
family, you say my name.

09:59.532 --> 10:00.668
>> ELLA: We're all trying to get

10:00.668 --> 10:01.969
to the same place.

10:01.969 --> 10:02.970
>> JENNY: Are we gonna be having

10:02.970 --> 10:03.971
this conversation for the next

10:03.971 --> 10:04.972
month?

10:04.972 --> 10:06.006
>> KATE: I will probably come

10:06.006 --> 10:08.275
back to it.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.911
To be the object of disgust--

10:10.911 --> 10:12.646
that's how I spent my first 20

10:12.646 --> 10:16.449
years as a trans person.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.386
I was disgusting to people.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.522
And I still am an object of

10:22.522 --> 10:24.224
disgust.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.560
It really gets me in the gut to

10:27.560 --> 10:31.464
receive that from L, G, B or T.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.433
*

10:39.873 --> 10:41.875
>> ELLA: Have you ever played

10:41.875 --> 10:43.210
fluffy bunny?

10:43.210 --> 10:45.345
(Candis laughing)

10:45.345 --> 10:46.847
(exclaiming)

10:46.847 --> 10:50.017
(laughing)

10:50.017 --> 10:51.919
>> KATE: Hillary Clinton or

10:51.919 --> 10:53.120
Donald Trump?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.387
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, I would

10:54.387 --> 10:55.723
never, ever, ever vote for

10:55.723 --> 10:57.725
Hillary.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.726
>> JENNY: Kill me now.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.260
Someone kill me now.

11:00.260 --> 11:01.328
>> CAITLYN: If Hillary becomes

11:01.328 --> 11:02.730
president, the country is over.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.731
>> CANDIS: Tell me the things

11:03.731 --> 11:04.732
she's horrible about.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.733
>> CAITLYN: Look at all the

11:05.733 --> 11:06.734
things that are going on in the

11:06.734 --> 11:07.735
Middle East, all because of what

11:07.735 --> 11:08.736
she did.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.738
She's a (bleep) liar.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.744
(phone rings)

11:20.781 --> 11:21.882
>> CAITLYN: Hey, guys.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.884
It's my mother, the winner of

11:23.884 --> 11:27.087
the PFLAG Betty DeGeneres Award

11:27.087 --> 11:29.256
for outstanding support.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.357
Say hi!

11:30.357 --> 11:31.358
(cheering)

11:31.358 --> 11:33.593
>> CANDIS: Hi, Mom!

11:33.593 --> 11:34.795
>> CAITLYN: They all say hi.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.063
All right, Mom. Love you.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.130
Have a good night.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.165
(beep)

11:38.165 --> 11:39.166
My mother called me.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.167
You know why?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.168
>> ELLA: Why?

11:41.168 --> 11:42.169
>> CAITLYN: She's telling me how

11:42.169 --> 11:43.837
much she's really starting to

11:43.837 --> 11:45.338
like Donald Trump.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.041
>> COURTNEY: What?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.342
(Caitlyn laughs)

11:49.342 --> 11:50.778
(groaning)

11:50.778 --> 11:52.479
>> CHANDI: Wah, wah, wah.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.281
>> JENNY: Wah-wah.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.049
>> COURTNEY: What?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.517
'Cause you're the... you're the

11:57.517 --> 11:59.286
only person she could call that

11:59.286 --> 12:00.821
was gonna celebrate that.

12:00.821 --> 12:01.822
>> CAITLYN: I know.

12:01.822 --> 12:02.823
>> COURTNEY: That's why.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.191
>> CAITLYN: She just hates

12:04.191 --> 12:05.192
what's going on.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.193
She's seeing this country...

12:06.193 --> 12:07.795
All of her husbands fought in

12:07.795 --> 12:08.796
World War II.

12:08.796 --> 12:09.797
>> CANDIS: No, no, no, no!

12:09.797 --> 12:10.798
>> CAITLYN: You know, land in

12:10.798 --> 12:11.799
Omaha Beach.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.433
My dad fought for this country.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.036
And now we're giving it away.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.037
>> CHANDI: What do you think of

12:17.037 --> 12:18.205
Donald Trump?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.373
>> CAITLYN: Um, I'm not a big

12:20.373 --> 12:23.076
fan, because I think of his

12:23.076 --> 12:25.078
macho attitude.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.579
I think he would have a hard

12:26.579 --> 12:28.615
time with women, when he doesn't

12:28.615 --> 12:30.483
even realize it.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.551
And it doesn't mean he wouldn't

12:31.551 --> 12:32.953
be good for women's issues.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.354
I think he would be very good

12:34.354 --> 12:37.324
for women's issues.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.859
>> COURTNEY: What?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.060
>> JENNY: Kill me now.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.361
Someone kill me now.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.362
>> CAITLYN: I don't think he's

12:42.362 --> 12:43.864
out there to destroy women or

12:43.864 --> 12:45.232
take things away or do any of

12:45.232 --> 12:48.201
that kind of stuff.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.840
I don't think my views have

12:52.840 --> 12:54.574
changed politically since

12:54.574 --> 12:55.976
transitioning.

12:55.976 --> 12:56.977
You know, we're talking about

12:56.977 --> 12:57.978
the economy.

12:57.978 --> 12:58.979
We're talking about our country

12:58.979 --> 13:00.013
surviving.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.348
We're talking about an economic

13:01.348 --> 13:03.383
system that can prosper.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.417
Just because I'm a woman now

13:04.417 --> 13:05.652
doesn't make me all of a sudden

13:05.652 --> 13:07.054
liberal.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.488
>> KATE: Hillary Clinton or

13:08.488 --> 13:10.057
Donald Trump?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.058
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God, I would

13:11.058 --> 13:13.360
never, ever, ever vote for

13:13.360 --> 13:14.661
Hillary.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.762
We're done. If-if Hillary

13:15.762 --> 13:16.864
becomes president, the country

13:16.864 --> 13:18.265
is over.

13:18.265 --> 13:19.432
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.433
>> CAITLYN: You can't fix

13:20.433 --> 13:21.568
immigration.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.735
You can't fix the economy.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.736
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

13:23.736 --> 13:24.737
>> CAITLYN: You know?

13:24.737 --> 13:26.073
>> CANDIS: The Kool-Aid.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.074
The Kool-Aid.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.075
>> CAITLYN: We don't have a

13:28.075 --> 13:28.741
country.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.877
And Hillary will not do it.

13:29.877 --> 13:30.543
>> CANDIS: She's an amazing

13:30.543 --> 13:31.211
woman.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.012
>> CAITLYN: Tell me what she's

13:32.012 --> 13:32.679
done that's good.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.346
Tell me.

13:33.346 --> 13:34.347
>> BUS DRIVER: They're quiet.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.015
>> CAITLYN: Please.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.016
>> BUS DRIVER: They're quiet.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.017
>> CHANDI: So you're a

13:37.017 --> 13:38.018
Republican up there, too?

13:38.018 --> 13:39.152
>> BUS DRIVER: Yes, I am.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.153
>> CHANDI: Okay.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.688
So he's cosigning for Cait.

13:41.688 --> 13:42.789
>> CAITLYN: No, he's-he's a

13:42.789 --> 13:44.057
conservative American.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.693
He's an American, yeah. Yeah.

13:46.693 --> 13:47.694
>> CHANDI: Nothing against you.

13:47.694 --> 13:48.695
Boo, I still love you, too, but

13:48.695 --> 13:50.230
I just needed everybody to know

13:50.230 --> 13:51.899
that you're cosigning.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.366
(chuckles)

13:53.366 --> 13:54.367
>> CANDIS: But, you know, there

13:54.367 --> 13:55.936
is a lot to love about Hillary.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.704
She's an amazing woman.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.106
Things that she's done in her

13:59.106 --> 14:00.340
life have been incredible!

14:00.340 --> 14:01.408
To go through...

14:01.408 --> 14:02.409
>> CAITLYN: What has she done in

14:02.409 --> 14:03.076
her life?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.077
What has she done...

14:04.077 --> 14:05.078
>> CANDIS: With the rights

14:05.078 --> 14:06.079
that-that... of women that she's

14:06.079 --> 14:07.080
gone through, it's been

14:07.080 --> 14:08.281
incredible!

14:08.281 --> 14:10.250
She's become a lawyer when it

14:10.250 --> 14:11.919
was so hard to become a lawyer.

14:11.919 --> 14:12.920
>> CAITLYN: What has she done?

14:12.920 --> 14:13.921
>> CANDIS: She has served our

14:13.921 --> 14:14.922
Senate.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.323
She was our Secretary of State.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.324
>> CAITLYN: And she was a lousy

14:17.324 --> 14:18.158
senator.

14:18.158 --> 14:18.959
>> CANDIS: She wasn't a lousy

14:18.959 --> 14:19.792
Senator.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.793
>> CAITLYN: She was horrible!

14:20.793 --> 14:21.794
>> CANDIS: Tell me! Tell me the

14:21.794 --> 14:22.795
things she was horrible about!

14:22.795 --> 14:23.530
>> CAITLYN: Look at all the

14:23.530 --> 14:24.264
things that are going on in the

14:24.264 --> 14:24.932
Middle East.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.333
All because of what she did.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.334
Look at... look at Benghazi.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.936
She lied to us.

14:28.936 --> 14:29.937
>> CANDIS: She didn't lie to us.

14:29.937 --> 14:30.637
>> CAITLYN: She's a (bleep)

14:30.637 --> 14:31.304
liar.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.305
>> CANDIS: When it comes to

14:32.305 --> 14:34.307
debating politics with Caitlyn,

14:34.307 --> 14:35.575
it's not a debate.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.244
She just talks and is yelling at

14:37.244 --> 14:39.112
us.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.113
That's an uncomfortable

14:40.113 --> 14:41.248
situation.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.249
>> CAITLYN: You want a person

14:42.249 --> 14:43.250
that's gonna lie to you?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.417
And then lied again about it and

14:44.417 --> 14:45.418
lied again about it?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.219
>> CANDIS: I'm gonna go to the

14:46.219 --> 14:46.954
other room.

14:46.954 --> 14:47.955
>> CAITLYN: And then all of her

14:47.955 --> 14:48.555
e-mails.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.556
>> CHANDI: Okay, okay.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.423
>> CAITLYN: She's a political

14:50.423 --> 14:51.091
hack.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.292
>> KATE: Oh, boy.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.326
>> CAITLYN: That's all she is.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.327
She's done nothing.

14:54.327 --> 14:55.963
>> CHANDI: Okay. I-I have to...

14:55.963 --> 14:57.130
I have to listen.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.099
I think, in a position where

14:59.099 --> 15:01.368
there were so many people

15:01.368 --> 15:04.037
against Republicans, made her

15:04.037 --> 15:05.038
really defensive.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.039
>> CAITLYN: Cleared this room

15:06.039 --> 15:07.040
out.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.041
>> CHANDI: Cleared it out.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.042
Nobody wants to talk to you

15:09.042 --> 15:11.811
right now, Cait.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.280
(horse neighs)

15:13.280 --> 15:14.381
>> CAITLYN: Today, the next

15:14.381 --> 15:15.715
adventure.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.285
>> CHANDI: Ooh. Uh, uh...

15:18.285 --> 15:19.286
(horse neighs)

15:19.286 --> 15:20.620
Whoa. I don't know what I'm

15:20.620 --> 15:21.621
doing.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.090
(horse neighs)

15:23.090 --> 15:24.591
>> CAITLYN: I look at all the

15:24.591 --> 15:26.359
issues, I think, in a much

15:26.359 --> 15:27.527
different way than most people

15:27.527 --> 15:28.761
in this room look at the issues.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.762
>> JENNY: It's not about the

15:29.762 --> 15:30.763
issues.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.332
We're telling you, we were

15:32.332 --> 15:34.301
scared.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.005
(door opens)

15:38.005 --> 15:39.006
>> JENNY: Oh, it's Candis.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.340
>> CANDIS: (groans, chuckles) I

15:40.340 --> 15:41.741
just got into a full screaming

15:41.741 --> 15:43.676
match with Caitlyn.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.677
With Caitlyn.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.678
>> KIP: You did?

15:45.678 --> 15:46.746
What did we miss?

15:46.746 --> 15:47.747
>> CANDIS: About Hillary

15:47.747 --> 15:48.881
Clinton.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.083
>> COURTNEY: What?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.484
(Candis sighs)

15:51.484 --> 15:53.220
>> CANDIS: I think Cait, she was

15:53.220 --> 15:55.422
disrespecting us in the way she

15:55.422 --> 15:57.024
was talking to us.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.092
I mostly got upset that she

15:59.092 --> 16:01.428
wasn't listening to what we were

16:01.428 --> 16:02.595
saying.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.097
She was talking down to us about

16:04.097 --> 16:06.433
our views and what she knew to

16:06.433 --> 16:09.102
be true, um, and was yelling at

16:09.102 --> 16:10.437
us.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.938
>> COURTNEY: She screamed?

16:11.938 --> 16:14.241
She screamed? How loud?

16:14.241 --> 16:15.242
>> CANDIS: I don't know.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.243
>> JENNY: Loud enough for Candis

16:16.243 --> 16:17.277
to come back here.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.745
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.113
>> CAITLYN: Tell me one good

16:20.113 --> 16:21.114
thing she's done.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.115
>> ZACKARY: Where is this anger

16:22.115 --> 16:23.116
coming from?

16:23.116 --> 16:24.117
>> CAITLYN: Where's the what?

16:24.117 --> 16:25.118
>> ZACKARY: This anger coming

16:25.118 --> 16:26.119
from.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.120
You seem like you're really

16:27.120 --> 16:28.121
angry about this.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.122
>> CAITLYN: It's so upsetting to

16:29.122 --> 16:31.058
me to see where this... where

16:31.058 --> 16:32.625
this whole thing is headed.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.693
>> ZACKARY: You know, I really

16:33.693 --> 16:36.829
appreciate debate, um, but I'm

16:36.829 --> 16:38.165
really reticent to engage if

16:38.165 --> 16:40.200
somebody's at an escalated pitch

16:40.200 --> 16:41.901
with their voice.

16:41.901 --> 16:43.736
You know, I try to be as, like,

16:43.736 --> 16:44.904
diplomatic as possible, and

16:44.904 --> 16:45.905
especially when it comes to

16:45.905 --> 16:46.939
politics.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.808
Um, Hillary Clinton, when she

16:48.808 --> 16:50.177
was Secretary of State, was the

16:50.177 --> 16:51.644
person who spearheaded the

16:51.644 --> 16:53.513
effort to make it easier for

16:53.513 --> 16:54.514
trans people to change their

16:54.514 --> 16:55.515
gender marker on their

16:55.515 --> 16:56.516
passports.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.717
>> CAITLYN: That is very good

16:57.717 --> 16:58.851
for us, okay?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.354
But we are .8% of the

17:01.354 --> 17:02.822
population, and that is a very

17:02.822 --> 17:05.492
small thing.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.493
>> ZACKARY: Listen, she's

17:06.493 --> 17:07.994
somebody who's dedicated her

17:07.994 --> 17:09.096
life to gender equality.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.097
>> CAITLYN: In the scheme of

17:10.097 --> 17:11.964
things, that is, like,

17:11.964 --> 17:13.933
itty-bitty, teeny-weeny...

17:13.933 --> 17:14.934
>> ZACKARY: I can go on, but I

17:14.934 --> 17:16.203
won't go on if I'm being

17:16.203 --> 17:17.537
interrupted.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.538
I'm listening to everything that

17:18.538 --> 17:19.972
you're saying, and...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.108
>> CAITLYN: If you look at it...

17:21.108 --> 17:22.375
>> ZACKARY: But I unfortunately

17:22.375 --> 17:23.976
don't feel, you know,

17:23.976 --> 17:25.845
comfortable or safe enough to

17:25.845 --> 17:28.248
disagree with you.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.882
And I think that that's-that's

17:29.882 --> 17:30.883
unfortunate.

17:30.883 --> 17:31.884
>> CAITLYN: You know what, I-I

17:31.884 --> 17:33.286
appreciate your candor and your

17:33.286 --> 17:35.188
calm voice.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.789
And you've calmed me down.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.859
But it's just... very upsetting

17:39.859 --> 17:41.628
to me.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.598
>> ZACKARY: You know, I'm aware

17:45.598 --> 17:47.400
that those ideas are out there,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.270
but I've never really been in

17:50.270 --> 17:51.438
the same room with somebody

17:51.438 --> 17:53.039
who's trying to kind of, like,

17:53.039 --> 17:55.608
come for me or come for, you

17:55.608 --> 17:57.610
know, my girlfriends, and sort

17:57.610 --> 17:59.646
of try to convince us that we're

17:59.646 --> 18:02.048
wrong.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.151
I mean, I think that probably

18:04.151 --> 18:06.953
comes from 65 years of being

18:06.953 --> 18:10.557
a Republican man.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.458
>> JENNY: She has a kind of

18:11.458 --> 18:13.493
bring-it-on sense of politics.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.428
What she doesn't know is how

18:15.428 --> 18:16.429
much it really hurts us, and it

18:16.429 --> 18:17.430
hurts us as her friends, and it

18:17.430 --> 18:18.431
hurts us as women.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.432
>> COURTNEY: She needs to

18:19.432 --> 18:20.433
listen.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.434
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.435
>> JENNY: When we we first got

18:22.435 --> 18:23.603
on this bus, I thought, "Wow.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.071
This is huge."

18:25.071 --> 18:27.039
Now I'm thinking, this bus is

18:27.039 --> 18:28.175
small.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.442
This bus has never felt so

18:29.442 --> 18:32.412
small.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.185
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.186
>> COURTNEY: Bunny.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.187
>> CAITLYN: Bunny.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.188
>> ZACKARY: Just put it in your

18:41.188 --> 18:42.189
cheek.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.190
>> ELLA: Oh, my God, I'm dying.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.191
>> CHANDI: Fluffy bunny.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.492
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.527
(laughter)

18:47.527 --> 18:49.496
>> KATE: I didn't come out until

18:49.496 --> 18:51.198
after my father died.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.199
I got up the courage to tell my

18:52.199 --> 18:54.367
mom, and she goes, "Wait! Wait!

18:54.367 --> 18:55.668
Wait! Wait! Wait!

18:55.668 --> 18:56.969
You get out of here right now,

18:56.969 --> 18:58.004
young man!

18:58.004 --> 19:00.440
And if you go through with this,

19:00.440 --> 19:01.741
if you really go through with

19:01.741 --> 19:03.343
this, don't bother coming back,

19:03.343 --> 19:06.779
because you're not welcome here.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.216
(crickets chirping)

19:09.216 --> 19:11.218
(bus engine approaching)

19:11.218 --> 19:12.219
>> WENDI: Welcome to Sunrise

19:12.219 --> 19:13.220
Springs.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.020
>> CAITLYN: Hi. Nice to meet

19:14.020 --> 19:14.887
you. What's your name?

19:14.887 --> 19:15.888
>> WENDI: Wendi.

19:15.888 --> 19:16.656
>> CAITLYN: Wendi. Caitlyn.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.257
Nice to meet you.

19:17.257 --> 19:17.824
>> WENDI: Welcome to have

19:17.824 --> 19:18.491
you here.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.526
How was your trip?

19:19.526 --> 19:20.360
>> CAITLYN: Uh, a little long,

19:20.360 --> 19:21.361
but not bad.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.362
>> WENDI: Yeah?

19:22.362 --> 19:23.230
>> CAITLYN: It wasn't bad at

19:23.230 --> 19:24.231
all.

19:24.231 --> 19:24.931
>> WENDI: What we were gonna do

19:24.931 --> 19:25.732
is take you directly to your

19:25.732 --> 19:26.733
rooms.

19:26.733 --> 19:27.534
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.368
>> KIP: Let's do it. It's cold.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.236
>> WENDI: And then, we're gonna

19:29.236 --> 19:30.237
go to dinner.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.003
>> CAITLYN: Let's go to-- let's.

19:31.003 --> 19:31.838
>> COURTNEY: We're ready. Okay.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.672
>> CAITLYN: Where did Candis go?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.440
>> WENDI: We'll start walking

19:33.440 --> 19:34.441
this way.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.909
>> CAITLYN: Hey, Candis?

19:36.909 --> 19:37.910
>> KIP: Candis Cayne, Caitlyn's

19:37.910 --> 19:41.748
calling for you.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.749
>> CHANDI: Paging CC.

19:42.749 --> 19:43.750
>> CANDIS: Sorry.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.352
>> CHANDI: Paging CC.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.254
>> CANDIS: Is Cait upset?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.255
>> CHANDI: Yes, she is.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.322
>> CANDIS: Is she?

19:49.322 --> 19:50.590
What did she say?

19:50.590 --> 19:51.758
>> CHANDI: She said, "Where's

19:51.758 --> 19:52.759
Candis?"

19:52.759 --> 19:53.926
>> CANDIS: Oh.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.795
>> CHANDI: She said, "Did I

19:55.795 --> 19:56.863
clear the room?"

19:56.863 --> 19:58.531
(laughter)

19:58.531 --> 19:59.799
>> CANDIS: Oh, honey, I can't.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.833
I-I'm sorry, I just couldn't

20:00.833 --> 20:03.903
hear her talking... just...

20:03.903 --> 20:04.904
Ooh.

20:04.904 --> 20:05.905
>> WENDI: Zackary?

20:05.905 --> 20:07.274
>> COURTNEY: What about Zackary,

20:07.274 --> 20:08.275
409?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.276
>> ZACKARY: You know, up until

20:09.276 --> 20:12.445
today, granted, it was day

20:12.445 --> 20:15.147
three, right, and it was very

20:15.147 --> 20:17.284
balanced, but when politics came

20:17.284 --> 20:18.885
up the second time around, it

20:18.885 --> 20:21.020
went from zero to 100 in, like,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.423
a second, and it felt really

20:23.423 --> 20:25.425
hostile.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.426
>> WENDI: Jenny.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.427
>> JENNY: Jenny.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.428
>> WENDI: Okay, so you're in

20:28.428 --> 20:29.429
419.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.430
>> JENNY: Okay.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.964
>> WENDI: There you go, 419.

20:31.964 --> 20:32.999
>> JENNY: This is what I was

20:32.999 --> 20:34.000
afraid of.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.203
Kate Bornstein and I are having

20:37.203 --> 20:38.438
the very conversation that I

20:38.438 --> 20:40.373
least wanted to have.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.842
Caitlyn Jenner is holding forth

20:42.842 --> 20:44.844
about politics.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.379
I'm thinking, "Get me out of

20:46.379 --> 20:49.382
here."

20:52.485 --> 20:54.454
(people sigh)

21:00.293 --> 21:02.795
>> JENNY: May I suggest we all

21:02.795 --> 21:04.096
join hands?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.032
I'm not gonna say grace.

21:06.032 --> 21:07.867
I'm just gonna accept the grace

21:07.867 --> 21:09.369
of being with all of you.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.037
Today was a hard day, I thought,

21:11.037 --> 21:12.439
um, and, uh...

21:12.439 --> 21:13.473
>> CAITLYN: It was a long...

21:13.473 --> 21:14.574
It's a long ride.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.843
>> JENNY: I'm grateful for all

21:16.843 --> 21:17.844
of you and for all that lies

21:17.844 --> 21:18.845
ahead.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.846
>> CHANDI: Amen.

21:19.846 --> 21:20.847
>> COURTNEY: Amen.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.550
>> CANDIS: Amen.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.151
>> CAITLYN: I love talking about

21:25.151 --> 21:26.686
politics and listening to other

21:26.686 --> 21:28.187
peoples' views and expressing my

21:28.187 --> 21:29.689
views, but it does cause

21:29.689 --> 21:30.723
tension.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.393
And maybe a good idea would be

21:33.393 --> 21:35.562
to change the subject.

21:35.562 --> 21:37.029
Five, six days from now, I

21:37.029 --> 21:39.432
accept Glamour magazine's Woman

21:39.432 --> 21:41.901
of the Year, and I've been kind

21:41.901 --> 21:43.069
of struggling with this thing.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.270
Besides the hair and the makeup

21:44.270 --> 21:45.572
and the clothes and this and

21:45.572 --> 21:47.374
that, to each person in this

21:47.374 --> 21:50.076
room who's had to work very,

21:50.076 --> 21:51.478
very hard to be the woman that

21:51.478 --> 21:53.380
they are, what is it to you to

21:53.380 --> 21:55.615
mean to be a woman?

21:55.615 --> 21:58.184
>> CHANDI: Mm. Being 100%

21:58.184 --> 22:00.553
comfortable in your skin and

22:00.553 --> 22:02.389
being confident.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.556
>> ELLA: I agree with Chandi.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.191
I think it's just being

22:05.191 --> 22:07.594
yourself.

22:07.594 --> 22:08.895
I think there's so many ways to

22:08.895 --> 22:09.929
be a woman.

22:09.929 --> 22:10.997
>> ZACKARY: Yeah, for me, I

22:10.997 --> 22:15.668
think being a woman is... being

22:15.668 --> 22:16.669
powerful and being aware of your

22:16.669 --> 22:17.670
power.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.671
>> CAITLYN: Okay, that's an

22:18.671 --> 22:19.672
interesting question...

22:19.672 --> 22:20.673
>> ZACKARY: Mm.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.674
>> JENNY: Yeah.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.675
>> CAITLYN: ...from my

22:22.675 --> 22:23.676
standpoint. You know why?

22:23.676 --> 22:25.077
Because a lot of people don't

22:25.077 --> 22:27.714
understand why would you ever

22:27.714 --> 22:29.849
transition from the strong,

22:29.849 --> 22:32.084
powerful person that a male is

22:32.084 --> 22:33.820
into a weak female.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.821
Now that's the peoples'

22:34.821 --> 22:35.822
perspective, okay?

22:35.822 --> 22:37.089
I don't believe that.

22:37.089 --> 22:39.091
I mean, I watch Kris, who's a

22:39.091 --> 22:41.894
very powerful woman, and she-she

22:41.894 --> 22:43.295
knew how to play the game.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.296
>> JENNY: The first thing I

22:44.296 --> 22:45.632
thought of was a quote by Simone

22:45.632 --> 22:47.266
de Beauvoir, who said one is not

22:47.266 --> 22:49.569
born a woman-- one becomes one.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.570
>> CAITLYN: Where do you come up

22:50.570 --> 22:51.671
with all this stuff?

22:51.671 --> 22:52.839
>> ELLA: I know.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.906
>> CAITLYN: I love it. I mean,

22:53.906 --> 22:54.907
I... I mean, I love it, but...

22:54.907 --> 22:55.908
>> JENNY: That's a great quote,

22:55.908 --> 22:57.009
and I think each of us have had

22:57.009 --> 22:58.611
to become women-- or except

22:58.611 --> 23:00.547
for-for Kate-- um, each of us

23:00.547 --> 23:01.614
have had to become women in

23:01.614 --> 23:02.615
ways...

23:02.615 --> 23:03.616
>> CAITLYN: They've struggled.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.617
>> JENNY: I mean that... I mean

23:04.617 --> 23:05.618
that respectfully.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.619
>> KATE: I-I got it

23:06.619 --> 23:07.620
respectfully.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.055
>> JENNY: Which means that we've

23:09.055 --> 23:11.023
each had to-to find, um,

23:11.023 --> 23:13.259
womanhood on our own terms.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.326
>> CAITLYN: I don't know if I'll

23:14.326 --> 23:15.995
ever really figure it out, what

23:15.995 --> 23:17.830
it is.

23:17.830 --> 23:20.266
Is it grace? Is it compassion?

23:20.266 --> 23:21.468
Is it looking at life in a

23:21.468 --> 23:22.469
different way?

23:22.469 --> 23:24.471
I... Honestly, I go down the

23:24.471 --> 23:26.706
street and I look at a billboard

23:26.706 --> 23:29.308
and for, you know, all these

23:29.308 --> 23:30.743
years, as a guy, I was looking

23:30.743 --> 23:31.944
up and go, "Oh, man, there's a

23:31.944 --> 23:32.945
hot chick."

23:32.945 --> 23:35.147
And so now I go down the street

23:35.147 --> 23:38.918
and I-I can't identify that I'm

23:38.918 --> 23:41.153
part of that community,

23:41.153 --> 23:43.623
"female," you know?

23:43.623 --> 23:45.324
I've been kind of the other way

23:45.324 --> 23:46.593
for so long, it's kind of tough

23:46.593 --> 23:48.495
for me to grasp that that's my

23:48.495 --> 23:49.996
sister up there.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.363
But I think the more time I

23:51.363 --> 23:53.500
spend in it, you know, and the

23:53.500 --> 23:55.602
more I'm around it, you kind of

23:55.602 --> 23:57.504
blend into that.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.505
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

23:58.505 --> 23:59.506
>> ZACKARY: When you're

23:59.506 --> 24:02.308
transitioning, your mind... is

24:02.308 --> 24:04.577
sometimes ahead of your body.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.912
And then there's other times

24:05.912 --> 24:08.648
when your mind has not caught up

24:08.648 --> 24:10.517
to your social position.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.151
It's tough. Like, I really love

24:12.151 --> 24:13.886
Caitlyn.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.688
She is six months in.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.190
But she hasn't quite caught up

24:18.190 --> 24:21.528
to herself yet.

24:21.528 --> 24:22.929
>> KATE: I didn't come out until

24:22.929 --> 24:25.064
after my father died.

24:25.064 --> 24:26.265
I was supposed to be the perfect

24:26.265 --> 24:27.734
son.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.069
If I had told him this, he

24:30.069 --> 24:31.538
would've done the Jewish thing

24:31.538 --> 24:33.573
of tearing his clothing, turning

24:33.573 --> 24:35.374
his back, and "I have no child."

24:35.374 --> 24:36.576
>> CAITLYN: Really?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.777
>> KATE: Oh, yes.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.911
>> CAITLYN: Wow.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.580
>> KATE: Yeah. So shortly after

24:40.580 --> 24:42.949
my dad died, I got up the

24:42.949 --> 24:45.351
courage to tell my mom, "Mom, do

24:45.351 --> 24:49.756
you know what a transsexual is?"

24:49.756 --> 24:52.324
"Transvestite?"

24:52.324 --> 24:54.561
And my father was a doctor.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.562
She knew the difference.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.563
She didn't want to know the

24:56.563 --> 24:57.564
truth.

24:57.564 --> 24:59.632
"No, Mom, a transvestite wants

24:59.632 --> 25:01.568
to wear women's clothing.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.036
Me, I'll be getting surgery.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.905
I'll be taking hormones."

25:05.905 --> 25:08.107
And she goes, "Wait, wait, wait,

25:08.107 --> 25:10.042
wait, wait.

25:10.042 --> 25:11.077
You get out of here right now,

25:11.077 --> 25:12.078
young man.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.146
You get out of here right now.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.148
And if you go through with this,

25:16.148 --> 25:17.684
if you really go through with

25:17.684 --> 25:19.051
this, don't bother coming back,

25:19.051 --> 25:20.252
because you're not welcome

25:20.252 --> 25:23.455
here."

25:23.455 --> 25:25.592
I was... I was dizzy.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.326
I never expected that.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.195
We'd had such... we had a

25:29.195 --> 25:31.363
mother-son relationship.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.600
That's a great thing.

25:33.600 --> 25:38.370
And... I threw it in her face.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.939
The last thing she said, "Wait a

25:39.939 --> 25:40.940
minute, what do you think you're

25:40.940 --> 25:42.274
gonna call yourself?"

25:42.274 --> 25:45.612
I said, "Kate. Kate Bornstein."

25:45.612 --> 25:49.616
"'Kate'?! Your name was Albert.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.151
That was my father's name.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.486
I will never call you Kate.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.222
If I have to call you Kate, you

25:56.222 --> 25:59.792
can call me Mrs. Bornstein."

25:59.792 --> 26:02.629
She went back to her iced tea.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.463
(chuckling)

26:04.463 --> 26:06.265
Three months pass, a big

26:06.265 --> 26:08.635
hurricane hit the Jersey Shore,

26:08.635 --> 26:10.336
and... which is where my mom was

26:10.336 --> 26:11.638
living, so I called to see how

26:11.638 --> 26:12.805
she was doing.

26:12.805 --> 26:13.940
We talked for a while on the

26:13.940 --> 26:15.174
phone.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.242
It was the first time we talked

26:16.242 --> 26:17.644
in months.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.111
And, uh, she very pointedly

26:19.111 --> 26:20.112
called me Albert.

26:20.112 --> 26:21.113
But we were polite to each

26:21.113 --> 26:22.114
other.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.115
Finally, she asked me, "How are

26:23.115 --> 26:24.116
you doing?"

26:24.116 --> 26:27.854
I said, "How am I doing?

26:27.854 --> 26:30.890
They're making, uh... making it

26:30.890 --> 26:32.659
terribly hard for me at work.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.660
That's how I'm doing, Mom.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.162
It's really, really hard.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.030
I-I can't talk anymore."

26:38.030 --> 26:39.866
I hung up on her.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.069
Ten minutes, 15, the phone

26:43.069 --> 26:44.370
rings.

26:44.370 --> 26:48.007
She goes, "Kate..."

26:50.977 --> 26:52.679
That was it.

26:52.679 --> 26:55.514
And it was beautiful.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.684
I said, "I love you, Mom."

26:57.684 --> 26:58.751
She said, "I love you, too,

26:58.751 --> 26:59.752
Kate."

26:59.752 --> 27:00.753
She told me something I'll never

27:00.753 --> 27:01.854
forget.

27:01.854 --> 27:04.056
She said, "Look, I know life is

27:04.056 --> 27:05.591
hard, but that's what happens,

27:05.591 --> 27:06.693
baby.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.960
You build a world-- it falls

27:07.960 --> 27:09.095
apart.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.063
But remember this, when your

27:11.063 --> 27:12.564
world falls apart, you always

27:12.564 --> 27:13.933
have the kind heart you were

27:13.933 --> 27:14.934
born with.

27:14.934 --> 27:15.935
And I will always love you,

27:15.935 --> 27:17.103
Kate.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.471
You're my daughter."

27:19.471 --> 27:21.440
(others exhaling)

27:23.542 --> 27:25.144
>> JENNY: My mother used to say

27:25.144 --> 27:26.713
it's impossible to hate anyone

27:26.713 --> 27:28.180
whose story you know.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.450
Kate Bornstein and I have...

27:31.450 --> 27:32.952
fought really hard to get where

27:32.952 --> 27:34.353
we are.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.722
I don't want difference of

27:35.722 --> 27:37.957
opinion to take away from the

27:37.957 --> 27:40.292
progress that we've made and-and

27:40.292 --> 27:41.293
the progress that the whole

27:41.293 --> 27:42.461
community has made.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.730
Kate and I need to come

27:43.730 --> 27:45.798
together.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.767
*

27:50.402 --> 27:52.571
>> KIP: Cait, she got a special

27:52.571 --> 27:54.273
package.

27:54.273 --> 27:55.274
(laughter)

27:55.274 --> 27:56.275
>> ELLA: It looks like a little

27:56.275 --> 27:57.409
vacuum cleaner.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.078
(whirring)

27:59.078 --> 28:00.146
>> COURTNEY: I never can use it

28:00.146 --> 28:01.147
now.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.249
I can never use it.

28:05.752 --> 28:09.088
(birds chirping, rooster crows)

28:09.088 --> 28:10.957
>> CAITLYN: Off to the horses!

28:10.957 --> 28:12.892
>> CANDIS: Yay.

28:12.892 --> 28:13.893
>> CAITLYN: You've never ridden

28:13.893 --> 28:14.560
a horse?

28:14.560 --> 28:15.294
>> CHANDI: Never ridden a horse.

28:15.294 --> 28:15.962
>> COURTNEY: You're

28:15.962 --> 28:17.897
devirginizing Chandi once again.

28:17.897 --> 28:18.898
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

28:18.898 --> 28:19.899
>> COURTNEY: Popping another

28:19.899 --> 28:20.900
cherry of hers.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.135
(laughter)

28:23.135 --> 28:24.136
>> CAITLYN: There has been a lot

28:24.136 --> 28:25.404
of tension on this bus.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.572
Maybe the right thing to do is

28:26.572 --> 28:28.007
take all the girls horseback

28:28.007 --> 28:29.241
riding.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.810
Just get out of the bus, get on

28:30.810 --> 28:32.812
a horse, go up into the

28:32.812 --> 28:34.814
mountains, look at the beautiful

28:34.814 --> 28:37.083
views, and maybe even blow off a

28:37.083 --> 28:38.384
little steam.

28:38.384 --> 28:39.385
>> ELLA: Have you ever played

28:39.385 --> 28:40.386
Fluffy Bunny?

28:40.386 --> 28:41.387
>> CHANDI: No. I don't even...

28:41.387 --> 28:42.388
>> ELLA: But usually you do it

28:42.388 --> 28:43.389
with marshmallows.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.456
Like, you put a marshmallow in

28:44.456 --> 28:46.793
and you say, "Fluffy bunny."

28:46.793 --> 28:47.894
>> CANDIS: Oh.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.228
>> ELLA: What if I tried...

28:49.228 --> 28:50.229
>> CHANDI: Fluffy Bunny

28:50.229 --> 28:51.798
with-with powdered donuts.

28:51.798 --> 28:54.133
>> ELLA: Powdered donuts, yeah.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.501
I'm doing it.

28:55.501 --> 28:56.803
At some point, the politics can

28:56.803 --> 28:58.670
only go so far.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.539
So we just needed a little

29:00.539 --> 29:01.874
lightening up and some laughing,

29:01.874 --> 29:04.410
so I did not hesitate to bring

29:04.410 --> 29:06.112
out that bag of powdered donuts.

29:06.112 --> 29:07.613
Oh.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.115
Fluffy bunny.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.817
(laughter)

29:10.817 --> 29:11.818
>> CANDIS: Does someone know the

29:11.818 --> 29:13.085
Heimlich maneuver?

29:13.085 --> 29:14.921
(laughter)

29:14.921 --> 29:16.688
>> COURTNEY: Suck 'em back.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.457
(laughter)

29:18.457 --> 29:19.826
>> CHANDI: Ooh...

29:19.826 --> 29:21.460
>> ELLA: Fluffy bunny.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.129
(laughter)

29:23.129 --> 29:24.964
>> CANDIS: This'll be five.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.165
>> CHANDI: Fluffy bunny!

29:26.165 --> 29:29.501
(laughter)

29:29.501 --> 29:30.502
>> ZACKARY: She's out.

29:30.502 --> 29:31.503
>> KATE: Yay!

29:31.503 --> 29:32.504
>> ZACKARY: Yay!

29:32.504 --> 29:34.106
>> CHANDI: Yay!

29:34.106 --> 29:35.374
(laughter)

29:35.374 --> 29:36.375
>> COURTNEY: All right, Cait,

29:36.375 --> 29:37.543
it's your turn.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.846
Caitlyn, you have to do six.

29:39.846 --> 29:40.847
>> CAITLYN: What?!

29:40.847 --> 29:41.480
(laughter)

29:41.480 --> 29:42.148
>> COURTNEY: Well, Ella did

29:42.148 --> 29:42.849
five.

29:42.849 --> 29:43.549
I'm gonna put these on for

29:43.549 --> 29:44.216
protection.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.217
>> CAITLYN: Lovely...

29:45.217 --> 29:46.218
>> COURTNEY: Fluffy.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.219
>> CAITLYN: Lovey?

29:47.219 --> 29:48.220
>> COURTNEY: Fluffy.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.021
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy...

29:49.021 --> 29:49.755
>> COURTNEY: Bunny.

29:49.755 --> 29:50.756
>> CAITLYN: ...bunny.

29:50.756 --> 29:51.757
>> COURTNEY: Yes.

29:51.757 --> 29:52.758
>> ELLA: Just put it in your

29:52.758 --> 29:54.493
cheek.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.062
>> COURTNEY: There's one.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.230
Fluffy bunny.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.966
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

29:59.966 --> 30:01.667
(laughter)

30:01.667 --> 30:02.701
>> COURTNEY: Here's two.

30:02.701 --> 30:03.702
>> KIP: Watch out, this is the

30:03.702 --> 30:04.770
backsplash area.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.638
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.140
(laughter)

30:08.140 --> 30:10.809
>> ELLA: Oh, my God, I'm dying.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.978
>> CHANDI: Fluffy bunny!

30:11.978 --> 30:13.179
>> CAITLYN: Fluffy bunny.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.180
(laughter)

30:14.180 --> 30:17.349
(cheering)

30:17.349 --> 30:18.584
Fluffy bunny.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.719
(laughter)

30:20.719 --> 30:21.753
>> ZACKARY: These-these are some

30:21.753 --> 30:24.590
sorority antics, for sure.

30:24.590 --> 30:25.591
(horse neighs)

30:25.591 --> 30:26.592
>> WOMAN: This is Bishop's

30:26.592 --> 30:27.593
Lodge-- we want to welcome you

30:27.593 --> 30:28.594
this morning.

30:28.594 --> 30:29.595
>> CAITLYN: Okay, Chandi, your

30:29.595 --> 30:30.596
first lesson.

30:30.596 --> 30:31.597
This is what you got to watch

30:31.597 --> 30:32.598
out for.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.599
>> CHANDI: Ooh.

30:33.599 --> 30:34.800
>> CAITLYN: Ooh, yeah. Ooh!

30:34.800 --> 30:35.801
>> CHANDI: Wow, that's a big

30:35.801 --> 30:36.802
dump.

30:36.802 --> 30:37.803
(chuckling)

30:37.803 --> 30:38.804
>> CAITLYN: Let's do it.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.973
Today, the next adventure.

30:40.973 --> 30:41.974
>> CHANDI: Ooh.

30:41.974 --> 30:42.975
>> MAN: Pistol Pete. Anybody can

30:42.975 --> 30:43.976
ride him.

30:43.976 --> 30:44.977
>> CHANDI: Pistol Pete.

30:44.977 --> 30:45.978
>> JENNY: Toes up, heels down.

30:45.978 --> 30:46.979
>> CAITLYN: Some never ridden

30:46.979 --> 30:47.980
before.

30:47.980 --> 30:48.981
Some have done a lot of riding.

30:48.981 --> 30:49.982
I've done a lot of riding in my

30:49.982 --> 30:50.983
day.

30:50.983 --> 30:51.984
>> JENNY: You're looking good,

30:51.984 --> 30:52.985
Chandi.

30:52.985 --> 30:54.020
>> CHANDI: Oh.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.054
>> MAN: All right. Everybody

30:55.054 --> 30:56.055
follow me.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.056
>> CAITLYN: Get that head

30:57.056 --> 30:58.057
pointed in the right direction

30:58.057 --> 30:59.058
and give him a little kick.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.326
>> ZACKARY: Yes. That way.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.928
(horse neighs)

31:01.928 --> 31:03.963
>> CHANDI: Um... Oh.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.164
Uh, uh...

31:05.164 --> 31:06.365
(horse neighs, sputtering)

31:06.365 --> 31:08.067
Uh...

31:08.067 --> 31:13.539
Uh... let's come get him.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.375
Okay. Tell them to come get him.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.110
(horse sputters)

31:18.110 --> 31:20.379
Okay.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.082
Oh, Pistol Pete.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.051
Whoa. I don't know what I'm

31:25.051 --> 31:26.052
doing.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.287
I'm-I'm trying to be calm.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.490
(horse sputtering)

31:31.490 --> 31:33.025
Okay.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.061
(horse neighs)

31:35.061 --> 31:36.963
Yes.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.730
Okay.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.432
Good job, Pistol Pete.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.467
(chuckles)

31:41.467 --> 31:42.468
>> MAN: You sure you never ride

31:42.468 --> 31:43.469
before?

31:43.469 --> 31:44.470
>> CHANDI: I'm positive.

31:44.470 --> 31:45.471
>> MAN: Oh, you're doing a very

31:45.471 --> 31:46.472
good job.

31:46.472 --> 31:47.539
>> CHANDI: Oh, well, great.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.674
>> MAN: It's like natural.

31:48.674 --> 31:49.875
>> CAITLYN: Hey, Zackary.

31:49.875 --> 31:50.876
>> ZACKARY: Yeah.

31:50.876 --> 31:51.877
>> CAITLYN: First time riding

31:51.877 --> 31:52.878
with boobs.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.213
>> ZACKARY: Yeah. Really.

31:54.213 --> 31:55.214
>> CAITLYN: That's why you need

31:55.214 --> 31:56.482
a good sports bra.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.017
(Zackary laughs)

31:58.017 --> 32:00.386
(horse neighs)

32:00.386 --> 32:01.387
>> JENNY: I don't want to be a

32:01.387 --> 32:02.454
nay-sayer...

32:02.454 --> 32:03.455
(chuckling)

32:03.455 --> 32:04.856
...but, um, there's gonna be

32:04.856 --> 32:05.992
trouble if we don't come

32:05.992 --> 32:07.259
together.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.827
I'm loving doing this.

32:08.827 --> 32:10.329
Knowing Caitlyn Jenner means

32:10.329 --> 32:12.564
going on wonderful adventures,

32:12.564 --> 32:13.799
but it's-it's about more than

32:13.799 --> 32:14.800
having fun.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.867
There really are things that

32:15.867 --> 32:17.736
should be called into question,

32:17.736 --> 32:20.006
because Caitlyn has been... I

32:20.006 --> 32:21.707
hate to say it, but she's been

32:21.707 --> 32:22.774
kind of a bully.

32:22.774 --> 32:23.775
>> CAITLYN: How pretty is this,

32:23.775 --> 32:24.776
huh?

32:24.776 --> 32:26.645
>> ZACKARY: This is beautiful.

32:26.645 --> 32:28.614
(insects trilling)

32:32.818 --> 32:34.920
>> KIP: Look what we got!

32:34.920 --> 32:36.422
Cait, she got a...

32:36.422 --> 32:37.423
>> COURTNEY: What is this?

32:37.423 --> 32:38.090
>> KIP: She got a special

32:38.090 --> 32:38.757
package.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.491
>> COURTNEY: What do you think

32:39.491 --> 32:40.492
it is?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.561
A tennis bracelet? Diamonds?

32:42.561 --> 32:43.562
Better.

32:43.562 --> 32:44.563
>> CAITLYN: Better?

32:44.563 --> 32:45.564
>> COURTNEY: Better than

32:45.564 --> 32:46.565
diamonds.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.766
It's my favorite thing in the

32:47.766 --> 32:48.767
world.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.036
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.203
I'm learning so much.

32:51.203 --> 32:52.204
>> CANDIS: The color's so

32:52.204 --> 32:53.205
pretty.

32:53.205 --> 32:53.872
>> CHANDI: The color is

32:53.872 --> 32:54.540
gorgeous.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.274
>> CAITLYN: A vroom-vroom.

32:55.274 --> 32:56.275
>> COURTNEY: A-a what?

32:56.275 --> 32:57.276
What did you just call it?

32:57.276 --> 32:58.277
You're just gonna grab it?

32:58.277 --> 32:59.278
>> CHANDI: Vroom!

32:59.278 --> 33:00.279
>> CAITLYN: Vroom.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.280
>> COURTNEY: You're just

33:01.280 --> 33:02.348
grabbing it.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.183
>> ELLA: Wait, this is amazing.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.784
>> CAITLYN: Mm-hmm.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.353
>> CANDIS: Show me.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.420
>> COURTNEY: Why is everyone

33:08.420 --> 33:09.421
touching it like that?!

33:09.421 --> 33:10.422
>> ELLA: Does it vibrate?

33:10.422 --> 33:11.423
>> COURTNEY: I'm gonna have to

33:11.423 --> 33:12.424
wash it!

33:12.424 --> 33:13.892
>> CANDIS: Hello?

33:13.892 --> 33:14.893
(laughter)

33:14.893 --> 33:15.894
H-Hello?

33:15.894 --> 33:16.895
>> COURTNEY: I never can use it

33:16.895 --> 33:17.896
now.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.231
I can never use it.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.200
(laughter)

33:23.702 --> 33:25.537
>> CANDIS: It's like lipstick.

33:25.537 --> 33:27.306
>> CHANDI: Oh!

33:27.306 --> 33:28.907
(whirring)

33:28.907 --> 33:30.876
(laughter)

33:32.911 --> 33:33.945
(indistinct chatter)

33:33.945 --> 33:35.781
>> CHANDI: We are gonna toast to

33:35.781 --> 33:38.484
the Glamo Woman of the Year.

33:38.484 --> 33:39.618
>> ELLA: Cheers.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.487
>> COURTNEY: Caitlyn Jenner.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.521
>> CAITLYN: This award is for

33:42.521 --> 33:43.855
all of us.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.092
(cheering)

33:46.092 --> 33:47.159
>> KATE: I have a happiness

33:47.159 --> 33:48.827
thing I'd like to share.

33:48.827 --> 33:49.828
>> CAITLYN: Good.

33:49.828 --> 33:52.364
>> KATE: I had many second

33:52.364 --> 33:53.365
thoughts about coming on this

33:53.365 --> 33:54.433
trip.

33:54.433 --> 33:56.135
I-I didn't know whether I could

33:56.135 --> 33:57.736
do it health-wise.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.206
But the other, uh, stumbling

34:00.206 --> 34:03.109
block was Boylan.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.576
>> JENNY: And-and it was mutual.

34:04.576 --> 34:05.944
Right?

34:05.944 --> 34:07.279
>> KATE: We are each other's

34:07.279 --> 34:09.115
evil twin.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.416
All right?

34:10.416 --> 34:14.286
We're both committed to trans...

34:14.286 --> 34:15.421
supremacy!

34:15.421 --> 34:16.422
(laughs)

34:16.422 --> 34:18.824
(laughter)

34:18.824 --> 34:23.195
Our tactics and our ideologies

34:23.195 --> 34:25.897
are loggerheads.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.666
We had a long talk.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.667
>> JENNY: Oh, we did.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.668
>> KATE: We did.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.404
What we ended up with is, "Some

34:32.404 --> 34:33.972
of your stuff is hard to hear

34:33.972 --> 34:35.574
and I know some of what I say is

34:35.574 --> 34:37.209
hard to hear and I'm trying to

34:37.209 --> 34:38.844
throttle it back in your

34:38.844 --> 34:40.146
presence.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.148
But I know you listen to me and

34:42.148 --> 34:43.682
I promise I'll listen to you."

34:43.682 --> 34:44.983
>> JENNY: And we came to a good

34:44.983 --> 34:46.952
place.

34:46.952 --> 34:48.654
Is there any way that our

34:48.654 --> 34:51.157
friendship, the fact that we

34:51.157 --> 34:52.591
disagree on so much but that we

34:52.591 --> 34:53.959
love each other so much, can we

34:53.959 --> 34:55.327
use the thing that we have to

34:55.327 --> 34:57.663
open her up a little?

34:57.663 --> 35:01.267
>> KATE: If she allows us in.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.535
So this brings me to my mea

35:03.535 --> 35:04.703
culpa...

35:04.703 --> 35:05.871
>> CAITLYN: Okay.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.273
>> KATE: ...and my olive branch

35:07.273 --> 35:11.042
to you.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.445
(sighs)

35:13.445 --> 35:15.481
The other day on the bus, I was

35:15.481 --> 35:17.449
a smartass.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.418
I said to myself, "Oh, I know

35:19.418 --> 35:21.420
Caitlyn's a Republican.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.454
Let's see if we can get a rise

35:22.454 --> 35:23.422
out of her."

35:24.456 --> 35:25.857
And I said, "Hey, Caitlyn..."

35:25.857 --> 35:27.226
>> CAITLYN: Did it work?

35:27.226 --> 35:29.094
>> KATE: "Caitlyn... Donald

35:29.094 --> 35:30.762
Trump or Hillary Clinton?"

35:30.762 --> 35:31.830
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I know, yeah.

35:31.830 --> 35:32.864
>> KATE: And we were off to the

35:32.864 --> 35:33.865
races.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.967
I walked out of the room while

35:35.967 --> 35:38.404
you were talking, and I want you

35:38.404 --> 35:39.838
to know it wasn't because of

35:39.838 --> 35:41.773
what you were saying.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.609
I want to know more about that.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.076
>> CAITLYN: Right.

35:45.076 --> 35:48.547
>> KATE: The kind of anger that

35:48.547 --> 35:49.548
was coming-- anger's a

35:49.548 --> 35:50.549
healthy...

35:50.549 --> 35:51.550
>> CAITLYN: It's passion.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.084
>> KATE: And I hear it as anger

35:53.084 --> 35:56.388
and I go, "Uh-oh, scared little

35:56.388 --> 35:58.857
boy, Daddy's angry."

35:58.857 --> 36:00.526
And I leave.

36:00.526 --> 36:01.793
>> JENNY: Caitlyn, I want to

36:01.793 --> 36:03.028
make sure that you hear that it

36:03.028 --> 36:05.397
made not just Kate but many of

36:05.397 --> 36:08.500
us uncomfortable.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.801
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I-I look at

36:09.801 --> 36:11.036
all the issues, I think, in a

36:11.036 --> 36:12.037
much different way than most

36:12.037 --> 36:13.038
people in this room look at the

36:13.038 --> 36:14.039
issues.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.040
>> JENNY: It's not about the

36:15.040 --> 36:16.542
issues-- we're asking you to

36:16.542 --> 36:17.909
hear the fact that we're telling

36:17.909 --> 36:20.346
you we were scared.

36:20.346 --> 36:22.314
*

36:27.152 --> 36:29.154
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I-I look at

36:29.154 --> 36:29.855
all the issues, I think, in a

36:29.855 --> 36:30.856
much different way than most

36:30.856 --> 36:31.590
people in this room look at the

36:31.590 --> 36:32.591
issues.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.592
>> JENNY: It's not about the

36:33.592 --> 36:34.092
issues.

36:34.092 --> 36:35.093
We're asking you to hear the

36:35.093 --> 36:36.362
fact that we're telling you we

36:36.362 --> 36:38.330
were scared.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.005
>> CANDIS: For me, it was the

36:47.005 --> 36:49.708
idea that I-I listen to you and

36:49.708 --> 36:51.310
what you... what you say, but

36:51.310 --> 36:53.178
sometimes you don't listen to

36:53.178 --> 36:56.014
me when I'm talking.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.082
>> CAITLYN: I... I agree with

36:57.082 --> 36:58.083
that, yes.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.084
>> CANDIS: So, that-that's what

36:59.084 --> 37:00.085
it is...

37:00.085 --> 37:01.987
>> CAITLYN: Or I disagree...

37:01.987 --> 37:03.121
and I get a little bit excited

37:03.121 --> 37:04.122
for the extreme.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.291
>> CANDIS: You do, yeah.

37:05.291 --> 37:06.292
>> CHANDI: When you're a sister

37:06.292 --> 37:07.459
and you're coming from a good

37:07.459 --> 37:08.860
place, these things should be

37:08.860 --> 37:09.961
received.

37:09.961 --> 37:10.962
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

37:10.962 --> 37:11.963
>> CHANDI: They don't have to be

37:11.963 --> 37:13.465
liked, but they should be

37:13.465 --> 37:14.866
received, and that's the

37:14.866 --> 37:15.901
important thing.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.604
>> JENNY: When you talk to us,

37:18.604 --> 37:20.472
we hope that you will speak with

37:20.472 --> 37:22.508
gentleness and with love.

37:22.508 --> 37:23.909
And I... I...

37:23.909 --> 37:25.176
>> CAITLYN: Um, I-I agree with

37:25.176 --> 37:26.177
that-- sometimes I get very

37:26.177 --> 37:27.546
passionate about it and I kind

37:27.546 --> 37:28.547
of feel Bruce comes in and

37:28.547 --> 37:29.047
I go... (grunts)

37:29.047 --> 37:30.048
>> JENNY: And that's the thing

37:30.048 --> 37:30.549
to pay atten...

37:30.549 --> 37:31.550
>> CAITLYN: Would you listen to

37:31.550 --> 37:32.183
me, what I have to say?

37:32.183 --> 37:32.984
>> JENNY: But that's the thing

37:32.984 --> 37:33.985
to-to pay attention to,

37:33.985 --> 37:34.486
because...

37:34.486 --> 37:35.487
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I totally agree

37:35.487 --> 37:35.987
with that.

37:35.987 --> 37:36.988
>> JENNY: It's... It was scary.

37:36.988 --> 37:37.989
>> CAITLYN: And I totally agree

37:37.989 --> 37:38.990
with you from that standpoint--

37:38.990 --> 37:39.658
I was a little rough, yeah.

37:39.658 --> 37:40.659
>> CHANDI: I didn't think you

37:40.659 --> 37:41.660
was rough-- you know, I sat

37:41.660 --> 37:42.661
there with you.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.630
I'm a rider, mm-hmm.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.501
>> CAITLYN: I admit I get

37:49.501 --> 37:52.203
very...

37:52.203 --> 37:55.140
uh, upset... uh, not upset, I

37:55.140 --> 37:57.242
get, I become very aggressive

37:57.242 --> 37:58.944
when it comes to politics.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.145
And listening is always

38:00.145 --> 38:01.780
something I have to work on,

38:01.780 --> 38:02.848
okay?

38:02.848 --> 38:04.983
That's the feminine side of me

38:04.983 --> 38:06.985
that I'm working on, yeah.

38:06.985 --> 38:07.986
>> ZACKARY: You know, I really,

38:07.986 --> 38:09.521
actually think, with all due

38:09.521 --> 38:11.457
respect, our community has been

38:11.457 --> 38:13.725
prone to infighting and division

38:13.725 --> 38:14.726
and conflict.

38:14.726 --> 38:15.727
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.929
>> ZACKARY: And a lot of anger.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.565
And I think that, as a

38:19.565 --> 38:22.668
community, the fact that we can

38:22.668 --> 38:24.736
all feel safe to kind of explore

38:24.736 --> 38:27.172
our differences in the most

38:27.172 --> 38:29.074
respectful way possible is

38:29.074 --> 38:31.710
modeling behavior for the trans

38:31.710 --> 38:34.145
community and for the world

38:34.145 --> 38:35.280
community.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.548
>> KATE: Well said.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.549
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, well, we need

38:37.549 --> 38:38.584
that conversation in this

38:38.584 --> 38:40.151
country, big time.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.152
>> ZACKARY: Minds are made to

38:41.152 --> 38:42.220
change.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.722
We are all evolving all the

38:43.722 --> 38:45.090
time.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.392
For me, having a friend like

38:46.392 --> 38:48.259
Caitlyn, I've evolved, you know?

38:48.259 --> 38:50.095
So I can't help but think that

38:50.095 --> 38:52.297
with her having, you know, five

38:52.297 --> 38:54.032
or six friends who have really

38:54.032 --> 38:55.401
different ideas about things

38:55.401 --> 38:56.402
is...

38:56.402 --> 38:58.604
We can help her evolve too.

38:58.604 --> 38:59.971
>> CAITLYN: By the way, Candis.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.139
>> CANDIS: Yeah?

39:01.139 --> 39:02.140
>> CAITLYN: On the Hillary

39:02.140 --> 39:03.575
Clinton issue-- I know you

39:03.575 --> 39:04.643
walked out and I felt really

39:04.643 --> 39:06.612
bad, and I just want to

39:06.612 --> 39:07.979
apologize.

39:07.979 --> 39:08.980
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

39:08.980 --> 39:09.981
>> CAITLYN: I did not mean to

39:09.981 --> 39:10.982
upset you.

39:10.982 --> 39:11.983
I might even take a picture with

39:11.983 --> 39:12.984
Hillary.

39:12.984 --> 39:13.985
(group gasps)

39:13.985 --> 39:15.687
I haven't... You and me and

39:15.687 --> 39:17.122
Hillary, um, but I didn't mean

39:17.122 --> 39:18.123
to upset you and I apologize.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.124
>> CANDIS: That actually means a

39:19.124 --> 39:20.125
lot.

39:20.125 --> 39:21.627
I d-I didn't mean to raise my

39:21.627 --> 39:22.961
voice, ever.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.162
>> CAITLYN: You know I love you.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.064
>> CANDIS: I love you too.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.065
>> CAITLYN: How do we get on the

39:27.065 --> 39:29.835
bus for 30 days and, uh, not

39:29.835 --> 39:33.071
go... not go after each other?

39:33.071 --> 39:36.442
Um, I need to be calmer.

39:36.442 --> 39:37.443
I think I could get more

39:37.443 --> 39:38.777
accomplished.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.546
Let little Caitlyn carry the

39:40.546 --> 39:44.249
conversation in a calm way.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.685
Well, I have to try that.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.319
Yeah.

39:48.319 --> 39:49.320
>> JENNY: Mr. Mayor, it's a

39:49.320 --> 39:50.321
pleasure.

39:50.321 --> 39:51.322
>> JAVIER: Welcome, and I'm glad

39:51.322 --> 39:52.591
you're here, because we are

39:52.591 --> 39:53.859
actually gonna do something.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.994
It's a very small effort to send

39:55.994 --> 39:56.995
a powerful message.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.964
>> KATE: My honor, Mr. Mayor.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.403
(rooster crows)

40:05.403 --> 40:06.104
(birds chirping)

40:06.104 --> 40:07.105
>> CAITLYN: And now we're going

40:07.105 --> 40:08.106
to meet the mayor.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.576
Yay!

40:10.576 --> 40:11.743
Caitlyn Jenner, hi, how are you?

40:11.743 --> 40:12.744
>> JAVIER: How are you, Caitlyn?

40:12.744 --> 40:13.278
Welcome to Santa Fe.

40:13.278 --> 40:14.279
>> CAITLYN: Very nice to meet

40:14.279 --> 40:14.780
you.

40:14.780 --> 40:15.781
>> JAVIER: I'm Mayor Gonzalez.

40:15.781 --> 40:16.515
>> JENNY: Mr. Mayor, it's a

40:16.515 --> 40:17.516
pleasure.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.817
>> JAVIER: Over the last year we

40:18.817 --> 40:20.051
passed a important, uh,

40:20.051 --> 40:21.920
ordinance-- a gender-neutral

40:21.920 --> 40:23.321
bathroom ordinance.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.890
A very small thing to do to

40:24.890 --> 40:26.758
change out, uh, the signs of a

40:26.758 --> 40:28.193
bathroom, but it sent out a very

40:28.193 --> 40:30.028
powerful message.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.029
It wasn't easy.

40:31.029 --> 40:31.530
There was a lot of

40:31.530 --> 40:32.531
fear-mongering that went on.

40:32.531 --> 40:33.532
>> CAITLYN: That's exactly,

40:33.532 --> 40:34.032
yeah.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.033
>> JAVIER: People trying to

40:35.033 --> 40:36.602
distort what we were trying to

40:36.602 --> 40:39.004
do, but I knew, because of Chloe

40:39.004 --> 40:40.772
and so many other people in our

40:40.772 --> 40:44.009
community, that we could not

40:44.009 --> 40:45.811
give up.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.779
>> KATE: The Santa Fe bathroom

40:47.779 --> 40:50.181
ordinance was a big step in the

40:50.181 --> 40:51.382
right direction.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.119
A single seater was labeled

40:54.119 --> 40:55.120
female.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.155
Another single seater was

40:57.155 --> 40:58.423
labeled male.

40:58.423 --> 41:00.926
What is the point in that?

41:00.926 --> 41:03.895
So they-they so wisely put up,

41:03.895 --> 41:05.531
okay, this is gender neutral.

41:05.531 --> 41:07.198
Whoever gets in here can use the

41:07.198 --> 41:08.199
bathroom.

41:08.199 --> 41:09.535
That makes so much sense.

41:09.535 --> 41:10.569
>> CAITLYN: Kate has been an

41:10.569 --> 41:11.937
activist in this community for

41:11.937 --> 41:13.572
30 years.

41:13.572 --> 41:14.673
>> KATE: 30 years.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.975
And you've given me a place to

41:16.975 --> 41:18.577
pee.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.712
Thank you so much.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.713
(applause)

41:21.713 --> 41:23.248
>> JAVIER: Thank you.

41:23.248 --> 41:24.550
And I'm glad you're here,

41:24.550 --> 41:25.917
because we are actually gonna do

41:25.917 --> 41:27.152
something-- we're actually gonna

41:27.152 --> 41:28.587
change out the signage...

41:28.587 --> 41:29.588
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

41:29.588 --> 41:30.088
>> KATE: Come on.

41:30.088 --> 41:31.089
>> JAVIER: ...of the bathrooms.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.090
>> CAITLYN: And I think you

41:32.090 --> 41:32.591
should do it.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.592
>> KATE: I didn't know that. Oh!

41:33.592 --> 41:34.359
>> JAVIER: Would you do it,

41:34.359 --> 41:35.360
would you help me do it?

41:35.360 --> 41:36.427
>> CAITLYN: I had a chance to

41:36.427 --> 41:38.597
talk to Kate about her issues

41:38.597 --> 41:41.332
over the last 30, 35 years,

41:41.332 --> 41:42.834
with, just the simple thing as

41:42.834 --> 41:44.670
the good old bathroom.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.838
And she told me some horrifying

41:46.838 --> 41:48.740
stories about how she was

41:48.740 --> 41:49.741
treated.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.242
So I thought it would really be

41:51.242 --> 41:52.443
appropriate-- because I think it

41:52.443 --> 41:53.912
would mean a lot to her-- if she

41:53.912 --> 41:55.480
changed the sign on the

41:55.480 --> 41:56.882
bathroom.

41:56.882 --> 41:57.883
>> JAVIER: And so, as a I said,

41:57.883 --> 41:59.851
it's a-it's a very small, uh,

41:59.851 --> 42:03.021
effort to send a powerful

42:03.021 --> 42:04.322
message to you and everyone else

42:04.322 --> 42:05.591
living in Santa Fe.

42:05.591 --> 42:06.592
So if you would help me put this

42:06.592 --> 42:07.726
up, I would be honored.

42:07.726 --> 42:09.695
>> KATE: My honor, Mr. Mayor.

42:13.699 --> 42:15.701
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

42:15.701 --> 42:18.604
(applause)

42:18.604 --> 42:20.038
>> KATE: More than safe--

42:20.038 --> 42:21.607
because "safe" is always

42:21.607 --> 42:22.908
relative-- more than safe, I

42:22.908 --> 42:24.610
feel included.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.311
I feel acknowledged, I feel

42:26.311 --> 42:30.248
respected.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.151
Putting the sign on the door

42:33.151 --> 42:34.886
that said "gender neutral" was

42:34.886 --> 42:36.922
surreal.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.389
But the fact is there are gonna

42:38.389 --> 42:39.825
be more signs like it, and

42:39.825 --> 42:42.493
Caitlyn was generous enough to

42:42.493 --> 42:45.697
say, "Kate, you do that."

42:45.697 --> 42:47.298
That's the generous spirit I

42:47.298 --> 42:48.399
want to touch in Caitlyn, right

42:48.399 --> 42:49.400
there.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.236
She was so sweet to give that to

42:51.236 --> 42:53.104
me.

42:53.104 --> 42:55.073
>> MAN: Surrounded by beautiful.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.842
Perfect.

42:56.842 --> 42:58.810
>> CAITLYN: Got it.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.482
>> CAITLYN: Kylie was supposed

43:04.482 --> 43:05.717
to be my date, I get a phone

43:05.717 --> 43:06.918
call from her saying she's had a

43:06.918 --> 43:09.955
wardrobe malfunction.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.489
>> KYLIE: My vagina was out.

43:11.489 --> 43:13.659
Not my boob, not my butt crack,

43:13.659 --> 43:15.093
my vagina.

43:15.093 --> 43:16.294
>> ZACKARY: Candis Cayne has a

43:16.294 --> 43:17.896
date tonight.

43:17.896 --> 43:19.164
>> CANDIS: I'm waiting for

43:19.164 --> 43:20.899
somebody, nobody's showing up.

43:20.899 --> 43:22.668
>> CHANDI: It's official.

43:22.668 --> 43:24.670
(cheering, applause)

43:24.670 --> 43:25.971
>> CAITLYN: It's almost, like,

43:25.971 --> 43:28.539
kind of throwing old Bruce...

43:28.539 --> 43:29.775
out the door.
