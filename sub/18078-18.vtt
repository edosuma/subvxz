WEBVTT

00:01.311 --> 00:03.320
We're looking for a friend
who disappeared.

00:03.438 --> 00:04.882
His name is Jason Duke.

00:04.901 --> 00:07.157
I got another one down here
asking about Jason Duke.

00:07.220 --> 00:08.909
What do you know
about Jason Duke?

00:08.930 --> 00:10.382
What the heck is going on
around here?

00:10.413 --> 00:12.287
Who are all these people
looking for you, Jason?

00:12.323 --> 00:15.505
I saw an armored car in a gold mine.
And it was full of gold.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.918
This must be the
Jason Duke fan club.

00:17.985 --> 00:21.797
Hey, Murdock, I don't like this town.
Something weird going on.

00:21.833 --> 00:24.550
Now I'm gonna ask
you boys one more time.

00:25.357 --> 00:29.054
Who are you, and what do
you want with Jason Duke?

00:31.932 --> 00:34.268
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.351 --> 00:36.061
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.145 --> 00:37.646
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.729 --> 00:38.897
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:38.981 --> 00:40.607
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.691 --> 00:42.317
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:43.944
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:43.986 --> 00:45.904
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:45.988 --> 00:48.448
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.532 --> 00:49.825
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.908 --> 00:52.244
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:16.245 --> 02:18.247
I told you it just
happens to be on the way.

02:18.330 --> 02:22.376
On the way? We're 70 miles
from Hannibal's film location.

02:22.459 --> 02:25.712
Come on, tell me more
about this Deborah.

02:26.004 --> 02:28.757
You know her in high school?
Is this your hometown honey?

02:28.799 --> 02:30.008
Is this the girl
you left behind?

02:30.050 --> 02:32.052
I ain't telling you nothing.
'Cause there's nothing to tell.

02:32.106 --> 02:33.637
Hey, why didn't you
stay back there on location?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.889
Faceman wanted me to work
in that catering truck.

02:35.973 --> 02:37.224
I hate that catering truck.

02:37.307 --> 02:39.977
You know he charges the company
$10 for every meal he fixes...

02:40.102 --> 02:43.730
and it only costs him $1.95, yet he
wanted me to work for minimum wage.

02:44.273 --> 02:46.191
I ought to
unionize that truck, strike...

02:46.275 --> 02:48.026
and drive that you-know-what
out of business.

02:48.110 --> 02:51.196
The crew of <i>The Bride of the Aquamaniac,
Part Two</i> would forever be grateful.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.615
That's why I wanted to stay
with my pal Baracus.

02:53.699 --> 02:58.161
And, as a favor to you, I am gonna
offer you all of my expertise...

02:58.245 --> 03:00.372
in the area of love and romance.

03:00.455 --> 03:02.541
With special benefits
derived from...

03:02.624 --> 03:05.002
a classic scientific device
of mine.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.712
A mood ring.

03:07.337 --> 03:09.756
See, right now it's purple,
that means you're anxious.

03:10.173 --> 03:12.509
You wearing the ring.
How can it tell how I feel?

03:12.592 --> 03:14.511
Now it's black,
that means you're angry.

03:14.594 --> 03:16.513
Did this girl wear your ring
when you were in high school?

03:16.538 --> 03:18.039
No, man,
she wore the Duke's ring.

03:18.094 --> 03:21.268
Duke? Duke.
The plot thickens.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.353
Hey, if the Duke wasn't the
captain of the football team...

03:23.437 --> 03:24.563
she would never have
took his ring.

03:24.612 --> 03:25.961
I thought you were the
captain of the football team.

03:25.986 --> 03:26.714
I was...

03:26.773 --> 03:28.775
after Jason Duke graduated.
- I see.

03:28.900 --> 03:32.154
Oh, forget it. He's probably fat,
bald-headed and wearing a stupid tie.

03:32.237 --> 03:35.574
Now it's green, that's envy.

03:35.657 --> 03:38.994
I bet it's got something to do with this
telegram that you've been hiding all day.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.374
I ain't got nothing to hide.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.961
"Scooter. Deborah Potter.
Whispering Pines.

03:48.045 --> 03:50.005
"Must see you immediately--"

03:50.088 --> 03:51.298
It said, "immediately."

03:51.381 --> 03:53.216
Immediately, immediately!

03:53.925 --> 03:55.677
It doesn't say, "If when
you're in the neighborhood...

03:55.761 --> 03:58.722
"let's stop by and let's talk about
old times and old acquaintances"...

03:58.805 --> 04:01.266
it says "immediately,"
right now, without delay...

04:01.350 --> 04:05.771
I can't wait any longer! I want you!
I need you! I love you!

04:05.854 --> 04:07.022
Shut up!

04:33.924 --> 04:36.343
Hey, man, where you think you're going?
Stay in the van.

04:36.468 --> 04:38.011
You're gonna need me in there.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.639
- I can handle this by myself.
- B.A.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.016
Deborah.

04:43.892 --> 04:45.977
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Me, too.

04:46.061 --> 04:48.021
How do you do?
I'm H.M. Murdock.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.358
Oh, this is my friend,
H.M. Murdock.

04:51.441 --> 04:52.859
I already said that.

04:52.943 --> 04:54.778
- This is Deborah.
- I know.

04:54.861 --> 04:58.698
The pleasure is all mine. B.A.
has told me so much about you.

04:58.824 --> 05:00.200
Glad to meet you.

05:00.617 --> 05:03.078
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Me, too.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.372
I just wish the Duke
were here to see you.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.582
The Duke.

05:14.172 --> 05:16.049
We got married
right after college.

05:17.008 --> 05:18.385
I can't believe it, Deborah.

05:18.468 --> 05:20.429
I can't believe
you married the Duke.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.264
I mean in high school
this guy was such a--

05:22.305 --> 05:24.599
- Big man on campus?
- Mr. Popularity?

05:24.641 --> 05:25.934
Quarterback
of the football team?

05:26.059 --> 05:28.895
Hey, those guys never scored. The
defense kept us in the game.

05:28.979 --> 05:31.273
Careful, B.A.,
my ring is turning fuchsia.

05:31.648 --> 05:33.984
Oh, Duke.
He's so charming.

05:34.943 --> 05:37.320
Yeah, the Duke was
quite a charmer, all right.

05:37.821 --> 05:41.324
After we got married he took a big
job at a bank on the North Side.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.994
So, how did you all
wind up out here?

05:44.786 --> 05:49.082
Three months ago, John Wells, the president
of the Whispering Pines Bank called.

05:49.291 --> 05:51.835
He'd seen Jason on one of those
cable shows on investments.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.588
He needed an investment
whiz and he wanted Jason Duke.

05:54.671 --> 05:56.214
He must've been flattered.

05:56.298 --> 05:57.257
Oh, he was.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.926
Vice President at 35,
and all that.

06:00.010 --> 06:02.512
But it was more.
We had this dream, you know...

06:02.679 --> 06:04.181
small town...

06:04.764 --> 06:08.810
clean air, everybody knows everybody else.
A good place to raise a family.

06:09.186 --> 06:10.854
- Coffee?
- Sure.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.483
Yeah, I know what you mean about
raising a family and all.

06:14.649 --> 06:16.443
They even threw in
this house free.

06:17.319 --> 06:18.987
He lived here for two months.

06:19.654 --> 06:21.990
Then I came out here
to join him...

06:22.782 --> 06:25.160
and he's nowhere in sight.
Just disappeared.

06:26.328 --> 06:30.415
I called the bank, the sheriff,
nobody knows where he is.

06:30.874 --> 06:32.751
I knew you were
a part of the A-Team...

06:32.876 --> 06:35.337
so I called your mother in Chicago
and she said you could help me.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.797
Don't worry, Deborah.
We do the best we can.

06:37.923 --> 06:39.799
You've got to find
the Duke, B.A.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.721
Are we gonna
try to find this guy?

06:44.846 --> 06:46.723
Yeah, we're gonna
try to find this guy.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.517
Are we gonna try hard?

06:48.642 --> 06:51.853
I told you once, we're gonna try to
find this guy. Don't ask me again.

06:52.687 --> 06:54.105
Don't you say nothing.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.502
Whoa, big guy, big guy.

07:15.585 --> 07:17.045
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

07:17.128 --> 07:19.214
Whoa, whoa, big guy.
Come back here.

07:21.466 --> 07:22.717
You just can't
kick down the doors...

07:22.801 --> 07:25.178
barge into the bank,
and find out what's happening.

07:25.262 --> 07:27.180
Why not? It's the bank.
He worked there.

07:27.264 --> 07:30.016
Now, what would Faceman do
if he was here right now?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.769
Forget it, man. You don't know
diddly-squat about running no scam.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.980
What do you mean, "I don't know
diddly-squat about running no scam."

07:35.063 --> 07:36.106
Face taught me everything.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.733
Look, the first American scam,
1625. Peter Minuit...

07:38.817 --> 07:41.403
buys Manhattan Island from the Manhattan
Indians for a bucketload of trinkets.

07:41.486 --> 07:43.321
- 1954-- 
- All right, all right, all right.

07:43.405 --> 07:45.365
- I get the idea.
- See, it's all attitude.

07:45.448 --> 07:46.408
Attitude.

07:46.491 --> 07:48.577
That's how I scammed you
just now.

07:48.868 --> 07:49.828
Attitude.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.497
And the right props.

08:15.770 --> 08:17.981
Hi, stranger.
You new in town?

08:18.064 --> 08:19.691
I'm only here on business.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.735
Good. What can I do for you?

08:22.986 --> 08:24.988
I'm Hampton Snavely,
Fairfield Computer...

08:25.113 --> 08:27.365
I'm here on a recall. You got my
notice in the mail, didn't you?

08:27.449 --> 08:28.491
What notice?

08:28.617 --> 08:31.286
I tell you, I'm
gonna have to talk to that boy.

08:31.369 --> 08:33.996
You see, we got some information
we have radiation leakage...

08:34.080 --> 08:37.708
from our Series 1000
high res color monitor here.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.586
- Which is what you got, right?
- Yeah.

08:39.794 --> 08:41.379
Say, why don't they
just issue...

08:41.462 --> 08:44.716
a 101 Eye Protect for Radiation
Blocking Enhancement?

08:44.758 --> 08:47.093
Well, I tell them
the same thing myself...

08:47.135 --> 08:48.762
but you know those guys...

08:48.803 --> 08:52.015
they're not gonna be satisfied
till somebody's nose falls off.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.769
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.
- Bless you.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.313
See here.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.193
Oh my, look at that,
that's turning a pale gray.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.944
What? Oh, lord.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.280
- This the only one you got?
- Yes, sir.

09:07.572 --> 09:08.907
I'll tell you what...

09:09.157 --> 09:11.076
- I'm gonna get this back to Fairfield...
- Uh-huh.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.494
...I'm gonna put it
in the shop...

09:12.577 --> 09:14.996
I'm gonna have it back here
before you can say Ralph Nader.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.207
- Well... 
- Here's a receipt for your equipment.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.458
...okay.

09:22.712 --> 09:25.965
And here's a stick of gum
that Fairfield's giving out...

09:26.049 --> 09:28.385
to counteract any of the ill
effects of the radiation.

09:28.677 --> 09:30.303
What kind of gum is this?

09:32.681 --> 09:34.057
Polysalicylate's.

09:34.724 --> 09:37.185
Sugarless? Not a darn
calorie in the thing.

09:38.061 --> 09:39.229
I'll be back.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.572
Not a scam artist, huh?

09:49.698 --> 09:50.824
Where do you think you're going?

09:50.907 --> 09:52.659
I can be
a computer specialist, too.

10:18.643 --> 10:20.061
Can I help you, please?

10:20.145 --> 10:23.481
How do you do? I'm Hampton
Snavely, from Fairfield Computer.

10:23.565 --> 10:24.733
Are you Mr. Duke?

10:24.816 --> 10:26.151
No, I'm John Wells.

10:26.192 --> 10:30.280
We're here to demonstrate the Series
1000 high resolution color monitor.

10:30.447 --> 10:32.407
Well, I'm afraid
Mr. Duke isn't here.

10:32.657 --> 10:33.908
I can't understand this.

10:33.992 --> 10:36.619
I mean, we made this appointment
almost two weeks ago.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.038
We drove all the way
from Fairfield.

10:39.122 --> 10:40.457
When do we break for lunch?

10:40.540 --> 10:42.375
Mr. Duke didn't tell me
about this meeting.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.794
I don't believe this,
you know, I have been...

10:44.878 --> 10:49.132
working for Fairfield Computer now for six
years, three months and eight days...

10:49.215 --> 10:51.926
and, in all that time,
I have never, never...

10:52.010 --> 10:54.679
missed an appointment or
failed to return a phone call.

10:54.763 --> 10:57.474
My motto is: Be punctual...

10:57.640 --> 10:59.058
or don't be.

10:59.813 --> 11:02.812
Here we are, Tuesday, the fifth.

11:03.688 --> 11:05.398
Well, I see the reason,
I mean...

11:05.482 --> 11:07.650
he didn't have it
written down at all.

11:08.193 --> 11:09.611
When do we break for lunch?

11:10.236 --> 11:11.780
I guess that means that...

11:12.238 --> 11:17.035
we're not gonna be demonstrating the
Series 1000 high resolution color monitor.

11:17.744 --> 11:18.828
Lunch.

11:23.124 --> 11:24.584
Well, he didn't
leave on his own.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.377
He's got appointments
clear up through today.

11:42.685 --> 11:44.979
You two boys making
some sort of delivery?

11:45.104 --> 11:46.648
Not exactly. Why?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.858
But you will be moving on?

11:49.734 --> 11:53.071
Well, we thought we might get a bite
to eat in that cafe over there.

11:53.154 --> 11:54.489
There's nothing to eat here.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.449
You can stop for food
in Centerville.

11:56.574 --> 11:58.868
Actually, I think we might
stay here for a while.

11:58.952 --> 12:02.330
That's too bad. 'Cause now I'll have
to ticket you for an expired meter.

12:02.413 --> 12:04.666
This meter's broke.
I couldn't put no money in it.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.710
Destruction of public
property, that's a $50 fine.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.671
But we didn't break this meter.

12:10.213 --> 12:12.882
Public rowdiness,
that's a $150 fine.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.425
What the heck is going on
around here?

12:14.509 --> 12:16.344
Using profanity in public.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.263
I can't recall a fine for that.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.515
Oh, well,
let's call it a night in jail.

12:20.598 --> 12:22.308
I said "heck."
That's not profanity.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.893
It is in Whispering Pine.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.145
This is outrageous.
I demand to see the judge.

12:26.271 --> 12:27.438
You're looking at him.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.445
I'll tell you what, I might be willing
to let this whole thing drop...

12:34.529 --> 12:37.657
if you two boys would just mosey
on out of town before sundown.

12:37.740 --> 12:39.659
We're looking for a friend
who disappeared.

12:39.742 --> 12:42.871
His name is Jason Duke and we
ain't leaving till we find him.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.461
Aquamaniac, please.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.048
No, I'll hold, I'll hold. Yes.

12:54.132 --> 12:56.217
You wanna tell me what you
want with Jason Duke?

12:56.509 --> 13:00.179
Well, we're just good friends.

13:00.263 --> 13:02.140
He ain't a very popular
fella in this town.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.309
You could be in trouble
just for knowing the guy.

13:04.559 --> 13:06.561
Maybe he's a crook, B.A.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.438
What he's done?
And where is he?

13:08.688 --> 13:12.025
I wish we knew. We've got some questions
we'd like to ask him ourselves.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.043
We got visitors.

13:32.837 --> 13:33.963
Well...

13:34.380 --> 13:39.052
look who we got here. This must
be the Jason Duke fan club.

13:39.177 --> 13:41.554
You fellas wouldn't happen
to be deputies, would you?

13:42.055 --> 13:43.473
That's a good one.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.641
I thought so.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.100
I tell you what...

13:46.476 --> 13:47.977
you boys done your time...

13:48.186 --> 13:49.646
you been here long enough.

13:50.104 --> 13:52.398
You know, we like it here. In
fact, we're looking forward to...

13:52.482 --> 13:54.275
breakfast in the morning.
- Yeah, well...

13:54.359 --> 13:57.278
you can catch breakfast in another town.
That is, if you cooperate.

13:58.988 --> 14:00.073
Come here.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.451
What do you know
about Jason Duke?

14:03.576 --> 14:06.245
Boy, this fella's made
a lot of friends in this town.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.998
I'm talking to you, dipstick.

14:10.541 --> 14:11.751
Hold it.

14:14.712 --> 14:19.133
Let's see how much he remembers with a
noose around his skinny friend's neck.

14:21.135 --> 14:23.721
Now I'm gonna ask
you boys one more time.

14:24.722 --> 14:27.767
Who are you, and what do
you want with Jason Duke?

14:27.850 --> 14:29.727
Hey, man, I told you,
he owed us some money.

14:29.852 --> 14:31.145
A wise guy, huh?

14:31.229 --> 14:35.483
Well, that's just what we need in
Whispering Pine, some more entertainment.

14:35.608 --> 14:36.859
Pull out, bro.

15:16.858 --> 15:19.777
Hey, watch out
for the merchandise.

15:20.361 --> 15:22.655
You know, Hannibal, we're supposed
to be back on the set tomorrow...

15:22.739 --> 15:24.157
for a 6:00 call.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.575
This is more important.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.038
Terrific. You guys are in town for 24 hours,
you're already on the ten most wanted list.

15:30.121 --> 15:31.706
- That's terrific.
- We work fast.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.458
No. He's got a point.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.084
They're hiding something,
Hannibal.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.588
I mean, Duke vanishes, we ask a few
questions and then everybody in town...

15:38.671 --> 15:40.840
is falling over themselves just
to show us the front door.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.508
Not to mention the tree limbs.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.096
Maybe Mrs. Duke can shed some light on
why her husband is such a sore point.

15:50.391 --> 15:52.268
Hi, Deborah. I'm sorry
I didn't get back sooner.

15:52.393 --> 15:53.811
B.A., what're you doing here?

15:53.895 --> 15:55.354
What do you mean,
what I'm doing here?

15:55.438 --> 15:57.315
These are my friends,
we come to find the Duke.

15:57.398 --> 15:59.192
The sheriff told me
you broke out of jail.

15:59.233 --> 16:00.902
- Great.
- Broke out?

16:00.985 --> 16:02.612
We almost got lynched
looking for the Duke.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.364
Oh, I'm afraid there's been
a terrible misunderstanding.

16:05.448 --> 16:06.741
The Duke isn't missing at all.

16:06.824 --> 16:08.451
I just got a call from Chicago.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.535
Maybe he's all right?

16:09.619 --> 16:12.413
Oh, yes. We got our signals
crossed and I panicked.

16:12.497 --> 16:14.290
You see, he went
to Chicago to get me...

16:14.373 --> 16:16.417
just as I came out here
to meet him and--

16:16.501 --> 16:18.461
Look, Deborah, I know you're
in some real bad trouble.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.879
And I'm gonna help you,
no matter what.

16:19.962 --> 16:21.464
The sheriff is looking for you.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.967
I'm a law abiding citizen. You've
been arrested more than once, B.A.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.345
Duke was right about you,
goodbye.

16:33.351 --> 16:35.978
- What do you say, B.A.?
- I say we help her.

16:36.062 --> 16:37.814
She's in trouble
and we help her.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.649
Hey, man,
she begged me for help.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.152
Hannibal, we're gonna have one angry crew
if we don't get this catering truck...

16:43.236 --> 16:44.737
back to the location.

16:45.154 --> 16:46.114
We're staying.

16:46.197 --> 16:48.366
Deborah's in trouble and we're
gonna find out what's going on.

16:48.491 --> 16:50.034
Right, great, sure, sure.

16:50.118 --> 16:52.745
Okay, B.A., you and Murdock can't
show your faces in town...

16:52.787 --> 16:54.497
so you stick around here
and keep an eye on the place.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.749
Face, we'll go
and stir the pot a little.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.418
Can't wait to change my clothes, I'm
getting to look too much like you.

17:20.857 --> 17:22.692
We gotta get a handle
on this guy.

17:23.358 --> 17:24.861
Any ideas, Lieutenant?

17:25.111 --> 17:27.363
Hey, leave it to the master.

17:28.906 --> 17:31.868
Hi, I'm Hampton Snavely.

17:33.411 --> 17:35.997
I'm from
the Fairfield Computers...

17:36.080 --> 17:39.375
I have an appointment
with Jason Duke.

17:40.751 --> 17:41.919
Yeah.

17:42.545 --> 17:45.715
Let me guess, you're a close
personal friend of the Aquamaniac.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.594
Well, have I been
to this town before?

17:58.060 --> 17:59.145
Yeah, it's me.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.731
I got another one down here
asking about Jason Duke.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.859
I can't harass every stranger
that comes through town.

18:07.195 --> 18:08.487
Hey, let me tell you
something, Jack.

18:08.571 --> 18:11.616
I happen to be the sheriff in this
town and don't you forget it.

18:15.786 --> 18:17.330
I'm Mike Takobi.

18:17.622 --> 18:20.875
Takobi and Dreyer. I insist you
release my client immediately.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.877
Takobi and Dreyer.
Really?

18:22.960 --> 18:25.046
Yes, sir.
You guys handled my divorce.

18:25.129 --> 18:26.297
Well, I'll be darned.

18:26.797 --> 18:28.466
Best $100 I ever spent.

18:28.758 --> 18:30.509
Another satisfied client.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.179
You, Takobi himself?

18:33.304 --> 18:35.681
That's right. Up here
at our northern office...

18:35.890 --> 18:37.683
when I heard about our client...

18:38.226 --> 18:39.310
in need.

18:42.313 --> 18:45.483
Look, I'm sorry I can't tell you
more about what's going on...

18:45.691 --> 18:48.653
but all these people been traipsing
in my office looking for this guy...

18:48.736 --> 18:50.112
interfering with my work.

18:50.238 --> 18:51.489
I understand, Sheriff.

18:51.614 --> 18:53.532
Now, I waived the fine...

18:53.616 --> 18:56.827
so I'd appreciate it
if your client just moved on.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.162
Yes, sir.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.627
Something go wrong, Face?

19:04.710 --> 19:07.004
How was I supposed to know
Murdock pulled the same gag.

19:07.088 --> 19:08.297
He ruined it for me.

19:08.506 --> 19:12.468
I'm sorry it didn't work out for
you, pal, but it also cost us time.

19:12.551 --> 19:13.761
Well, maybe not.

19:13.844 --> 19:15.596
I don't figure this sheriff
for a wrong number...

19:15.638 --> 19:20.893
but somebody's all over him trying to find
out about the people looking for Jason.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.353
He called a guy...

19:22.687 --> 19:26.107
555-6540.

19:27.191 --> 19:28.359
How'd you get the number?

19:28.526 --> 19:32.280
Oh, thank heavens for the
old-fashioned rotary dial telephone.

19:32.363 --> 19:33.823
Let's find out who it is.

20:00.141 --> 20:02.685
It's somebody called Blackburn.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.064
Please, Mr. Blackburn,
can't I just talk to him?

20:07.148 --> 20:09.317
I don't want you
talking to anybody.

20:09.608 --> 20:10.943
That's your problem.

20:11.694 --> 20:14.530
Quit talking to those guys from
out of town. You understand?

20:32.256 --> 20:35.426
Murdock, you stick with him. I'm going
in the house to talk to Deborah...

20:35.509 --> 20:37.094
and find out what's going on.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.201
I couldn't say anything...

21:00.284 --> 21:02.328
he was right here
behind the door.

21:02.620 --> 21:03.996
They've got the Duke.

21:24.725 --> 21:25.768
Kid?

21:26.394 --> 21:27.978
Can I borrow your bike?

21:28.062 --> 21:29.730
Get your own wheels, man.

21:31.649 --> 21:32.858
I'll buy it from you.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.112
It's not for sale.
This thing's been customized.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.949
I'll throw in this dog.

21:40.699 --> 21:43.410
Really? My mom won't
buy me a dog.

21:44.662 --> 21:46.122
I want you to have him.

21:46.664 --> 21:47.665
You sure?

21:47.873 --> 21:48.999
He's all yours.

21:51.335 --> 21:52.711
Thanks, Mister.

21:52.795 --> 21:54.713
Hey, come here.
Hey, boy.

21:55.965 --> 21:58.175
Thanks, kid.
You'll never regret it.

22:44.013 --> 22:46.473
Come on, boys. Hurry
up, we ain't got all day.

22:50.519 --> 22:51.937
A gold mine.

22:57.818 --> 22:59.695
Wonderful stuff there.

23:04.742 --> 23:06.035
Well, looky here.

23:07.828 --> 23:09.914
Come on, boys,
let's get that turkey.

23:10.414 --> 23:11.665
You drive.

23:59.922 --> 24:01.882
Stop, the bridge
won't support us.

24:14.895 --> 24:18.899
There's a mine out there, they're pulling
gold out of it like it was Fort Knox.

24:19.024 --> 24:20.901
And it's guarded by
about a dozen guys...

24:21.026 --> 24:24.446
including the
"Lynch a Visitor Society."

24:25.114 --> 24:26.573
This coffee's terrible.

24:26.657 --> 24:30.244
Oh, well, that's easy for you to say, you
haven't been cooking for 200 people.

24:30.411 --> 24:33.580
Tell me, how many scoops is it for
400 cups of coffee? Tell me that.

24:33.664 --> 24:35.833
At least we know
why everybody's so unfriendly.

24:35.958 --> 24:39.253
They got a working gold mine, the last thing
they want is for the word to get out.

24:39.378 --> 24:42.006
Yeah, this place would turn
into a boomtown overnight.

24:42.131 --> 24:44.508
Hence all visitors are
<i>persona non grata.</i>

24:44.842 --> 24:47.344
Just how does Duke
fit into all this?

25:01.817 --> 25:03.068
Deborah!

25:03.277 --> 25:04.194
I slipped out.

25:04.278 --> 25:06.780
I just wanted to drop this off,
I thought you'd all be hungry.

25:06.864 --> 25:08.574
Oh, but I can see
you don't need it.

25:08.657 --> 25:10.993
Oh, no, I got the situation
well in hand here.

25:11.076 --> 25:14.121
See, I've made my specialty,
chicken a la king.

25:15.956 --> 25:19.460
Oh, well, we can always have the
chicken tomorrow as leftovers.

25:20.586 --> 25:22.713
You said the Duke was
investing in precious metal?

25:22.796 --> 25:24.590
Yeah, that's his area
of expertise.

25:24.715 --> 25:27.343
That must've been a European telephone
number that I saw on his calendar.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.510
It makes sense.

25:28.635 --> 25:30.763
They'd need an expert to
deal on the gold they mined.

25:30.846 --> 25:32.306
But why make him disappear?

25:32.389 --> 25:33.474
Beats me.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.685
First thing we have to do is
find out who owns that mine.

25:36.810 --> 25:38.812
Well, there's a claims desk
at the bank.

25:38.937 --> 25:41.231
B.A., you want to
help Deborah, right?

25:41.315 --> 25:42.483
Of course I do.

25:42.566 --> 25:45.277
That's means personal sacrifice.

25:45.652 --> 25:47.237
We're gonna need that gold
around your neck.

25:47.321 --> 25:50.115
Well, forget it, Hannibal. This
gold has a special meaning to me.

25:50.199 --> 25:51.367
It's the only way.

25:51.450 --> 25:54.328
We can't go to the jewelry
store and buy a lot of gold...

25:54.411 --> 25:55.537
they'll get suspicious.

25:55.621 --> 25:56.789
Well, you can use
my wedding band.

25:56.914 --> 25:58.040
Forget it.

26:03.670 --> 26:04.838
Take it.

26:05.589 --> 26:07.383
That's the one
I gave you last Christmas.

26:07.508 --> 26:08.926
Shut up, fool.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.187
Hi, there.

26:20.604 --> 26:21.647
Hi.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.149
I'm Mike Takobi
of Takobi and Dreyer.

26:25.109 --> 26:27.277
- The guys from TV.
- That's us.

26:27.403 --> 26:31.407
You know, you guys handled my divorce.
Best $100 I ever spent.

26:31.865 --> 26:33.242
You weren't married
to the sheriff, were you?

26:33.325 --> 26:34.868
Oh, please.

26:36.036 --> 26:37.830
But what can I do for you?

26:37.996 --> 26:41.583
I'd like to stake a claim
for a client of mine.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.044
Wow, is that real?

26:44.128 --> 26:46.255
Sure is. Can you please
meet me at my desk?

26:46.338 --> 26:47.423
Mmm-hmm.

26:52.010 --> 26:53.929
There'll be a $15 filing fee.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.264
That's fine.

27:04.815 --> 27:06.567
Show me where you wanna stake.

27:09.278 --> 27:10.529
It's right...

27:11.155 --> 27:12.197
here.

27:12.322 --> 27:15.492
Oh, are you sure? That shaft
has been dead for 90 years.

27:15.576 --> 27:17.953
Well, my client's an old guy
but he says it's here.

27:18.078 --> 27:19.288
Okay.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.999
Well, he says there's somebody
working the shaft over here.

27:22.124 --> 27:24.376
- Who's my client's neighbor?
- Well...

27:24.835 --> 27:27.671
we're not supposed
to give out that sort of info.

27:27.754 --> 27:29.173
Well, it could be
our little secret.

27:29.298 --> 27:32.009
We could discuss it over dinner
at my house in Beverly Hills.

27:33.343 --> 27:34.720
You married?

27:34.803 --> 27:38.098
Now do you think I'd ask you to my
house if I had a wife sitting in it?

27:40.267 --> 27:44.146
Let's see that is registered
to Wade Blackburn.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.772
Never heard of him.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.192
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

27:48.358 --> 27:49.568
You won't forget my offer.

27:49.651 --> 27:51.904
Oh, don't worry, I won't.

28:16.386 --> 28:17.554
Okay.

28:25.103 --> 28:27.272
All right, whiz kid,
get in there.

28:31.735 --> 28:33.779
Got a new neighbor
out at the mine.

28:33.987 --> 28:35.280
Some guy just staked a claim.

28:35.364 --> 28:36.657
Well, get rid of him.

28:37.574 --> 28:39.785
We'll take our friend here
over our place.

28:40.244 --> 28:43.205
There's just too many people
spooking around that mine.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.290
Who are all these people
looking for you, Jason?

28:45.415 --> 28:46.667
I really don't know.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.252
Don't give us that.

28:48.919 --> 28:51.588
There was a big black guy with
a Mohawk and a gold necklace.

28:51.713 --> 28:54.925
Big, black and Mohawk sounds
familiar, but not the gold.

28:55.217 --> 28:57.010
The guy I knew didn't own squat.

28:57.553 --> 28:59.179
Whoever they are,
we'll bury them.

28:59.263 --> 29:02.766
Yes, sir, this is going to be the
richest little bank in the world.

29:02.891 --> 29:04.518
I owe a lot to you and the boys.

29:04.601 --> 29:06.562
As long as you hold up your end.

29:07.646 --> 29:09.356
We both get what we want.

29:11.066 --> 29:13.151
- Sign these.
- Wait a minute, what's that?

29:13.235 --> 29:14.653
They're the rest
of the certificates...

29:14.720 --> 29:15.930
for the Swiss account.

29:16.488 --> 29:17.781
With these you can pass...

29:17.864 --> 29:20.867
the gold into the economy
without raising any eyebrows.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.411
See?

29:22.661 --> 29:24.830
That's why they
call him "The Whiz."

29:25.539 --> 29:27.165
You could have gone far.

29:27.416 --> 29:28.875
- Too bad.
- Shut up.

29:28.959 --> 29:32.004
Okay, when do I get my cut?

29:32.337 --> 29:34.047
Just before we pull out.

29:34.965 --> 29:37.384
After we've finished
all our business.

29:37.467 --> 29:39.136
I don't care what you do to me.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.597
Just do me a favor
and leave Deborah out of it.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.308
Well, as long as you do
what you're supposed to...

29:44.933 --> 29:47.519
you ain't got nothing
to worry about now, have you?

29:49.313 --> 29:52.441
Rusty, find your brothers and
take care of that prospector.

29:52.608 --> 29:53.775
All right.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.511
Ain't you heard?
Gold rush is over.

30:22.512 --> 30:23.930
Yeah, we're talking to you.

30:24.014 --> 30:25.432
What'd you say?

30:25.724 --> 30:26.892
Who are you?

30:27.100 --> 30:28.602
Name's Wheezer.
Albert Wheezer.

30:28.685 --> 30:30.395
Gotta claim this here mine.

30:30.937 --> 30:32.898
Gonna give the gold bug
one more try.

30:33.106 --> 30:34.149
Old miner, huh?

30:34.232 --> 30:35.859
Prospector like my daddy...

30:35.942 --> 30:37.152
and his daddy before him.

30:37.819 --> 30:39.488
A real family tradition.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.949
This ain't funny, he's right
around the corner from us.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.285
Will you shut up, Rudy.
I know that.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.122
Hey, that's part of
my equipment now.

30:49.247 --> 30:51.208
That was my granddaddy's.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.502
Well, what a shame.

30:59.216 --> 31:01.551
You be careful with those.
I only got two pair of those.

31:04.888 --> 31:06.264
Not any more.

31:07.391 --> 31:08.850
We want you
out of here, old man.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.060
My mine.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.688
No, it ain't.
Let him go, boys.

31:19.069 --> 31:20.404
Pack it in, old-timer.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.739
We're gonna be up on that
ridge watching you leave.

31:23.323 --> 31:25.242
You're still
here in the morning...

31:25.659 --> 31:27.786
well, we ain't gonna be
so neighborly.

31:42.092 --> 31:44.052
Oh, boy.
This is difficult, huh?

31:44.136 --> 31:46.471
We do all the digging,
Hannibal has all the fun...

31:46.555 --> 31:48.890
sitting out front
playing Yosemite Sam.

31:51.017 --> 31:53.061
I just can't believe we're
doing all this for Deborah.

31:53.186 --> 31:54.771
Her being married
and everything.

31:54.896 --> 31:57.190
Hey, man, there's more
to life than romance.

31:57.315 --> 31:58.483
There's friendship.

31:58.650 --> 31:59.860
You're right.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.654
She is beautiful, though,
and she's smart.

32:02.988 --> 32:04.364
She ain't that smart.

32:04.448 --> 32:06.408
She married a guy
who wears ties.

32:07.951 --> 32:11.621
We're through. That's Blackburn's mine.
Call Hannibal.

32:18.420 --> 32:19.629
Well...

32:21.798 --> 32:23.258
I'll be darned.

32:24.634 --> 32:26.386
You ain't seen nothing yet.

32:35.979 --> 32:37.063
Look at this, Hannibal.

32:37.147 --> 32:38.982
Oh, boy, talk
about striking it rich.

32:39.065 --> 32:40.776
They didn't even
have to dig for it.

32:43.278 --> 32:46.823
Remember that armored car robbery in
Coopersville a couple of months back?

32:46.948 --> 32:49.576
Yeah, they never did
find that truck, did they?

32:49.659 --> 32:51.411
Uh-uh. Good place
to hide it.

32:51.578 --> 32:53.955
Remote mine,
outside a remote town.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.499
Except that they have
one big problem.

32:55.624 --> 32:58.835
How are they gonna rid
of all this marked gold?

32:59.127 --> 33:00.504
They must have
tried everything possible...

33:00.587 --> 33:02.005
to change the form of the gold.

33:03.173 --> 33:06.468
So they pretend to mine it. Melt it down and
carry it out as if it was in the walls.

33:06.510 --> 33:09.137
Then they get an investment
whiz, Jason Duke...

33:09.888 --> 33:11.932
to sell the gold
in the international market.

33:12.015 --> 33:13.683
He must have found out
what was going on.

33:13.767 --> 33:16.853
Yeah. Well, what's
the plan, Hannibal?

33:16.937 --> 33:17.938
We can just drive it out...

33:17.979 --> 33:20.440
but they might think we're the
cops, panic and kill Duke.

33:20.524 --> 33:21.900
We want Jason Duke.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.445
I'm sure they'll be willing
to exchange him for...

33:25.529 --> 33:27.197
their gold which we now have.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.950
Which we now have as long as
we're standing right here...

33:30.033 --> 33:32.077
but you know, this stuff
weighs 28 pounds a bar.

33:32.202 --> 33:33.620
It'd take
the four of us about...

33:33.787 --> 33:36.289
two days to haul it to the
other end of the tunnel.

33:36.373 --> 33:37.791
We don't have to move it.

33:38.625 --> 33:41.169
All we have to do
is make it disappear.

35:35.951 --> 35:37.953
Not bad. Not bad at all.

35:38.787 --> 35:40.622
We're only half finished, guys.

35:40.789 --> 35:44.000
We gotta paint the catering truck
to look like the one we've cut up.

36:08.108 --> 36:09.401
Still here, huh?

36:09.901 --> 36:10.944
Yeah.

36:11.194 --> 36:12.821
He was whittling all night.

36:13.279 --> 36:14.114
Yeah.

36:14.155 --> 36:15.323
What'd you whittle?

36:15.657 --> 36:16.741
Oh.

36:18.159 --> 36:19.744
Whittled me a gun.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.547
You boys, show yourselves.
Come on.

36:30.630 --> 36:32.382
Don't be afraid of an old man.

36:32.507 --> 36:33.550
You got our attention.

36:33.633 --> 36:37.053
I've seen many a things in my life, but
I never saw what I saw last night.

36:37.137 --> 36:38.221
What was that?

36:38.346 --> 36:41.599
I saw an armored car in a gold mine.
And it was full of gold.

36:41.641 --> 36:43.643
I thought you boys
were watching this old coot.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.021
We was. He got up
twice the whole night.

36:46.187 --> 36:48.440
Pa! Pa!

36:50.066 --> 36:52.902
It's gone. The truck's
gone. Vanished.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.697
I worked all night to move that.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.490
You boys must have
fallen asleep.

36:57.657 --> 36:58.867
Now, where the hell is it?

36:58.992 --> 37:01.161
Right up behind you.
Look up there.

37:04.998 --> 37:06.875
Now, I'll make
this short and simple.

37:09.669 --> 37:11.421
You got Jason Duke.

37:11.921 --> 37:13.339
I got the gold.

37:13.882 --> 37:15.425
You wanna swap, huh?

37:15.508 --> 37:17.010
That son of yours is quick.

37:17.594 --> 37:19.304
You know that bridge
over Otter Creek?

37:19.387 --> 37:20.221
Yeah.

37:20.305 --> 37:23.099
Meet me there at noon
and bring Jason Duke.

37:23.516 --> 37:24.934
I'll bring the truck.

37:25.143 --> 37:26.644
And bring that...

37:29.230 --> 37:30.815
crooked bank officer.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.861
I might want him to sign a recommendation
for Jason Duke's next job.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.086
I've always wanted
to do a bridge swap...

37:51.169 --> 37:52.378
just like in the movies.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.381
Aren't they traditionally used
for the exchange of spies?

37:55.757 --> 37:58.384
Works for anybody who
doesn't trust each other.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.357
All right, let's do it!
Bring us the keys.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.735
We'll come over there and get Duke back
on this side. We'll throw you the keys.

38:15.860 --> 38:18.029
Fine. Let's just
get started.

38:27.580 --> 38:28.832
Baracus?

38:29.124 --> 38:30.291
B.A. Baracus?

38:30.375 --> 38:31.417
Hey, brother, you all right?

38:31.543 --> 38:32.544
Yeah.

38:35.296 --> 38:36.381
You got Deborah with you?

38:36.464 --> 38:40.093
So Blackburn wouldn't be tempted to
kidnap while we made this exchange.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.137
Hurry up and get him
on the other side.

39:09.289 --> 39:12.125
Hannibal, you and
your bridge drops.

39:16.629 --> 39:19.007
Hey, Pa.
The gold's floating.

39:21.676 --> 39:22.927
Hold it.

39:25.305 --> 39:27.307
Now, since when does gold float?

39:27.432 --> 39:29.434
Gold doesn't float, stupid.

39:29.726 --> 39:31.561
Take the truck and pick up
the rest of them.

39:32.187 --> 39:33.313
Move it.

40:01.966 --> 40:05.220
Jason, you're just a little
too smart for your own good.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.387
Now get in the mine.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.847
It always was his problem.

40:07.972 --> 40:09.432
Now, let me take a guess.

40:09.599 --> 40:13.102
He figured out that the grade of gold coming
out of this couldn't be mined around here.

40:13.186 --> 40:14.395
Very good.

40:15.104 --> 40:20.235
So we made him an offer, but he
was just too honest to go for it.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.028
Another long-standing problem.

40:22.195 --> 40:24.113
These guys will never
get away with this.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.531
I'm afraid they already have.

40:25.615 --> 40:28.006
They've got enough paperwork out of me
to dispose of the rest of the gold.

40:28.076 --> 40:29.994
Yeah, but they don't have
the rest of the gold.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.329
Oh, we will.

40:31.454 --> 40:33.998
You got one hour to remember
where the gold is hidden.

40:34.457 --> 40:36.793
After that, we blow the mine.

40:36.876 --> 40:38.628
Could you make it
two hours, see...

40:38.962 --> 40:40.755
some of us haven't seen
each other for a while--

40:40.838 --> 40:42.632
Get in the mine, wise guy.

40:43.007 --> 40:45.718
And don't try to sneak out through
the other end. We got it plugged.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.637
He's got no sense of humor.

40:54.811 --> 40:56.521
You know, I can't
believe you're here.

40:56.729 --> 40:58.398
I can't believe
you came to help me.

40:58.481 --> 41:00.692
I didn't.
I came to help Deborah.

41:05.321 --> 41:07.407
Look, I wanna thank you
and your friends...

41:07.699 --> 41:08.908
for trying to help me.

41:08.992 --> 41:10.493
I'm sorry it wound up like this.

41:10.576 --> 41:12.203
Hey, man, it ain't over yet.

41:12.370 --> 41:13.746
Hannibal will think
of something.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.623
The man always have a plan.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.583
Well, what's the plan, Hannibal?

41:17.834 --> 41:18.960
Simple.

41:19.627 --> 41:21.337
Put the truck back together.

41:21.671 --> 41:23.131
It ain't always a good plan.

41:23.298 --> 41:25.466
Hannibal, those parts are
stashed all over the mine.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.218
Anybody got a better plan?

43:11.406 --> 43:14.075
Hey, B.A., what's
this part used for?

43:14.242 --> 43:15.618
Man, leave me alone.

43:19.664 --> 43:21.082
What about this part?

43:21.207 --> 43:23.084
Save it for the next truck.

43:30.967 --> 43:32.593
What are we gonna
call this thing?

43:32.885 --> 43:34.428
B.A.'s mistake.

43:41.644 --> 43:44.522
Okay. We give up.
You got it.

43:45.148 --> 43:46.774
We'll tell you
where the gold is.

43:48.442 --> 43:49.360
Where is it?

43:49.485 --> 43:51.571
In the mine,
we just scattered it.

43:51.696 --> 43:52.780
Well, let's go get it.

43:52.864 --> 43:56.409
Oh, you won't have to.
We're gonna bring it to you.

45:26.332 --> 45:27.458
The captain and the defense.

45:27.541 --> 45:28.793
We still got it.

45:36.133 --> 45:37.426
We wanna thank you all again.

45:37.510 --> 45:38.386
Anytime.

45:38.469 --> 45:42.098
You realize that with all the
stock options they gave you...

45:42.181 --> 45:45.518
as part of your original deal when you
came out here, and given the fact that...

45:45.601 --> 45:49.480
a convicted felon like Wells
cannot be a bank officer...

45:49.814 --> 45:54.777
you are now president
of the Whispering Pines Bank.

45:54.944 --> 45:55.903
Really?

45:55.987 --> 45:57.113
Trust him.

45:57.697 --> 45:58.823
Congratulations.

45:58.906 --> 46:01.951
And, look, I'd like to talk to you
about a small bank loan because...

46:02.034 --> 46:05.496
I think mood rings are
gonna come back in a big way.

46:05.871 --> 46:07.623
Well, anything
you want, Murdock.

46:08.666 --> 46:11.335
I think we just may stay
in Whispering Pines.

46:11.502 --> 46:12.753
What do you think, Deborah?

46:13.170 --> 46:15.214
I think that's a good plan.

46:16.132 --> 46:18.926
Deborah, I'm sure you and Duke
will be very happy here.

46:19.176 --> 46:23.222
You know, all those years you
were following my footsteps...

46:23.306 --> 46:25.141
I could always hear you
coming closer and closer.

46:25.266 --> 46:26.543
I could have caught you, too.

46:26.645 --> 46:28.102
Yeah, you probably could have.

46:28.561 --> 46:30.730
You probably think
after I married Deborah...

46:31.022 --> 46:32.982
she used to talk about you.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.442
Well...

46:36.360 --> 46:37.528
I ain't gonna tell you.

46:37.737 --> 46:38.946
That's good, Duke.

46:40.948 --> 46:42.616
I want you to have this.

46:44.076 --> 46:45.578
Hey, man, but you won it.

46:45.745 --> 46:47.121
Yeah, but you deserve it.

46:47.621 --> 46:49.165
It's for the most
valuable player.

46:51.876 --> 46:53.085
Thanks.
