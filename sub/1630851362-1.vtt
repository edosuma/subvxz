WEBVTT

01:50.168 --> 01:51.584
A pretty girl,

01:51.751 --> 01:54.209
with neither voice nor talent,

01:54.376 --> 01:58.459
the idol of the Boulevard... Nana.

02:03.001 --> 02:07.418
Bordenave, director of the Variétés,

02:07.584 --> 02:11.376
cynical and surly.

02:35.668 --> 02:41.043
Countess Sabine Muffat.

02:54.668 --> 03:00.168
Count Muffat,
Chamberlain to the Empress.

03:08.501 --> 03:11.084
Count de Vandeuvres,

03:11.251 --> 03:13.668
distinguished, urbane,

03:13.834 --> 03:17.126
the last of a long line

03:17.293 --> 03:21.376
and owner of a stable of racehorses.

03:28.001 --> 03:34.959
Georges Hugon,
the Count de Vandeuvres' nephew.

03:38.376 --> 03:43.834
Fauchery, journalist and dramatist.

06:23.876 --> 06:29.418
A smitten admirer,
Hector de la Faloise.

08:18.793 --> 08:22.459
"That woman
is the chicest of the chic!

08:22.626 --> 08:27.168
"I shall go henceforth
and bedeck her in flowers!"

08:42.834 --> 08:46.876
"I'm going to congratulate Bordenave
on his success."

10:12.793 --> 10:16.668
"You're not going to join
the long line

10:16.834 --> 10:19.626
"of Nana's suitors?"

10:34.959 --> 10:37.501
"Why not?"

11:09.709 --> 11:16.709
"Our young star will be
very flattered by your visit, Count."

12:17.376 --> 12:20.876
"My dear friend,
allow me to introduce

12:21.043 --> 12:24.001
"His Excellency Count Muffat."

14:00.668 --> 14:03.834
Francis,
Nana's habitual hairdresser

14:04.001 --> 14:07.293
and sometime banker.

14:12.501 --> 14:16.626
Zoe, Nana's chambermaid...

14:16.751 --> 14:18.918
Fully confident

14:19.084 --> 14:22.293
in her mistress's future.

15:24.793 --> 15:28.626
"Francis, pass me the comb."

16:34.543 --> 16:39.626
In the empty theatre,
far from her husband,

16:39.793 --> 16:46.709
but under Bordenave's cynical eye,
the beginnings of a tryst...

18:27.251 --> 18:29.918
"May I hope to see you later,

18:30.084 --> 18:32.751
"at supper?"

19:32.543 --> 19:34.918
"Muffat is smitten with you.

19:35.126 --> 19:37.959
"And it looks like Fauchery

19:38.126 --> 19:41.918
"will get rid
of the Countess for us.

19:42.084 --> 19:44.668
"Poor Muffat!"

19:48.334 --> 19:54.334
"I think that this time
I'll get myself a partner!"

20:08.918 --> 20:14.459
Fauchery takes
Countess Muffat home.

22:14.376 --> 22:17.793
"Is the Count home yet?"

22:23.126 --> 22:28.751
"Bring me a cloak and hat.
I'm going out."

22:30.918 --> 22:34.709
The next morning,
the two guilty spouses

22:34.876 --> 22:37.459
meet on the threshold

22:37.626 --> 22:40.543
of their now broken home.

24:06.251 --> 24:10.918
<i>Pessimistic rumours abound</i>
<i>about the financial situation</i>

24:11.084 --> 24:14.626
<i>of one</i>
<i>of our most Parisian theatres.</i>

24:14.793 --> 24:18.084
<i>Nevertheless,</i>
<i>with considerable courage,</i>

24:18.251 --> 24:22.709
<i>the director</i>
<i>is apparently starting rehearsals</i>

24:22.918 --> 24:25.959
<i>for a new show.</i>

24:27.584 --> 24:33.376
At the Variétés,
Bordenave is doing the casting

24:33.584 --> 24:36.709
for the new play.

24:58.084 --> 25:04.084
Nana dreams of playing
the Little Duchess.

25:20.209 --> 25:24.084
As does Rose Mignon.

26:30.209 --> 26:34.543
"And now the part
of the Little Duchess,

26:34.709 --> 26:39.168
"a role of grace
and elegant refinement..."

27:15.709 --> 27:19.668
"There's a magnificent speech here."

27:43.126 --> 27:49.834
"And it is you, my little Rose,
who will incarnate this role."

28:07.501 --> 28:09.918
"What about me?

28:10.126 --> 28:14.793
"You don't think
I'm going to play the tart, do you?"

28:18.793 --> 28:24.959
"A distinguished role
suits me down to the ground!"

28:59.126 --> 29:03.043
"You may well laugh!
But you have no one

29:03.209 --> 29:07.793
"to play the elegant roles
but me!"

33:03.251 --> 33:07.251
"Look, Nana. I love you,

33:07.418 --> 33:12.334
"and I would make
any sacrifice for you."

33:21.959 --> 33:24.834
"I can't accept."

33:34.876 --> 33:36.293
"Why?"

34:13.834 --> 34:19.751
"Don't be such a child!
You're so naive."

35:24.126 --> 35:26.834
"I spit on money!"

35:45.084 --> 35:50.168
"If I were to be given
what I most desire..."

36:06.834 --> 36:10.918
"I want the part
of the honest woman

36:11.126 --> 36:14.209
"in their show."

36:22.251 --> 36:25.001
"What honest woman?"

36:33.751 --> 36:38.293
"The one in their play,
<i>The Little Duchess.</i>

36:38.459 --> 36:42.793
"I know the part already. Listen..."

37:49.751 --> 37:55.584
"Bordenave will only put
a price on it, I suppose."

38:06.293 --> 38:10.168
"You'd do that for me?"

38:22.668 --> 38:28.251
"Oh, you're so good to me,
my little pussycat!"

39:23.084 --> 39:29.001
"That's our new lover, a Count!"

40:02.709 --> 40:08.293
"If you're clever,
you'll get your partner."

40:40.751 --> 40:44.459
"That's an egg cup, Count."

41:08.751 --> 41:16.043
"What would you say to Nana
having the Duchess's role?"

41:42.543 --> 41:46.626
"Heavens!
What will the playwright say?"

41:50.043 --> 41:51.668
"Who is it?"

42:56.543 --> 43:02.251
"Nana will play that part.
It's a case of retraction."

43:12.834 --> 43:17.084
"Isn't that right, Count?"

43:56.876 --> 43:59.626
"Nana? Not at any price!"

44:23.251 --> 44:24.959
"I demand it!"

46:42.126 --> 46:44.293
A little prematurely,

46:44.459 --> 46:48.084
Rose Mignon's comrades
are congratulating her.

47:08.418 --> 47:12.043
"My little Rose,
you'll have to make a sacrifice."

47:20.668 --> 47:24.709
Modesty not being her strong point,
Nana comes to gloat.

47:46.293 --> 47:49.376
"There's the slut
who stole my part!"

48:28.543 --> 48:30.918
"Bah! Such a vulgar woman!"

49:37.668 --> 49:40.959
THE LITTLE DUCHESS

49:41.793 --> 49:47.209
Despite Muffat's financial support,

49:47.376 --> 49:51.709
Nana's attempt at great art

49:51.876 --> 49:56.709
is a resounding flop.

50:16.959 --> 50:21.376
This last performance

50:21.501 --> 50:26.876
lays her friends' hopes to rest.

51:50.084 --> 51:52.793
"What a delightful character!"

52:07.543 --> 52:13.251
"Allow me to introduce
Count de Vandeuvres."

53:12.376 --> 53:19.584
"Would you allow me a moment
of your time, Count?"

54:45.418 --> 54:49.168
"We've spent a lot of money

54:49.293 --> 54:52.418
"on repairing the ceiling..."

54:56.126 --> 54:59.418
"and replacing the carpeting."

55:07.168 --> 55:11.376
"It's pure jealousy, a conspiracy.

55:11.584 --> 55:14.293
"I couldn't care less."

57:27.418 --> 57:30.251
"Leave the theatre."

57:39.251 --> 57:42.334
"You'll be all mine."

58:11.334 --> 58:13.251
CANCELLED

58:14.126 --> 58:18.584
Nana, unable to be a great actress,

58:18.751 --> 58:22.834
becomes a great courtesan.

58:28.293 --> 58:30.668
In Nana's mansion,

58:30.834 --> 58:33.959
the gifts come in an avalanche.

58:59.501 --> 59:05.209
By herself, Zoe cannot look after
all her mistress's dresses.

59:10.001 --> 59:13.584
The besotted little boy
Georges Hugon

59:13.751 --> 59:17.126
trails in Nana's wake

59:17.293 --> 59:19.959
like a faithful puppy.

1:00:16.709 --> 1:00:18.584
"Is it my fault?

1:00:18.751 --> 1:00:21.668
"These old things
just fall to bits."

1:00:31.751 --> 1:00:33.418
"Poor Sweety!

1:00:33.626 --> 1:00:37.043
"But all these things
are just made to be broken.

1:00:37.209 --> 1:00:38.626
"I'll show you."

1:01:50.709 --> 1:01:53.126
"Count de Vandeuvres!

1:01:53.293 --> 1:01:57.293
"What's your uncle doing here?"

1:02:04.668 --> 1:02:07.959
"He wants to take me
away from you,

1:02:08.168 --> 1:02:10.168
"to stop me seeing you."

1:02:57.501 --> 1:03:02.543
"I'll soon tame your uncle!"

1:05:12.626 --> 1:05:15.584
Then Nana, changing her plans,

1:05:15.709 --> 1:05:18.293
adopts an angelic demeanour.

1:06:48.668 --> 1:06:52.209
"It's about my nephew,
Georges Hugon,

1:06:52.376 --> 1:06:55.126
"whose conduct is worrying me."

1:07:08.626 --> 1:07:12.876
"His presence here
is inappropriate."

1:07:36.626 --> 1:07:42.334
"Do you understand my meaning?"

1:08:41.001 --> 1:08:43.543
"My uncle can be violent.

1:08:43.709 --> 1:08:47.959
"I can't leave Nana alone with him."

1:09:31.334 --> 1:09:36.793
"Don't get yourself
into such a state."

1:10:09.459 --> 1:10:14.626
"I swear that child
is like a brother to me."

1:10:18.793 --> 1:10:21.459
"Is that true?"

1:11:48.459 --> 1:11:51.168
"Is madam receiving visitors?"

1:12:11.168 --> 1:12:13.168
"Insolent thing!

1:12:13.293 --> 1:12:18.001
"Isn't an honest woman
always able to receive visitors?"

1:12:38.376 --> 1:12:41.709
"I was with Count de Vandeuvres,

1:12:41.876 --> 1:12:45.293
"a truly gallant man."

1:14:14.626 --> 1:14:17.543
Two of Vandeuvres' horses

1:14:17.709 --> 1:14:20.251
are racing in the Grand Prix.

1:14:20.418 --> 1:14:23.251
The favourite.

1:14:26.209 --> 1:14:29.126
The outsider.

1:15:35.793 --> 1:15:39.209
Nana's jockey.

1:15:43.543 --> 1:15:46.918
Lusignan's jockey.

1:16:58.293 --> 1:17:01.834
Bordenave,
accompanied by Tatan Néné

1:17:01.959 --> 1:17:04.418
and Maria Blond.

1:17:24.793 --> 1:17:30.709
Vandeuvres is thinking that
to snatch Nana from her protector,

1:17:30.834 --> 1:17:35.043
he will need plenty of gold.

1:18:17.751 --> 1:18:22.626
And the gentleman,
already corrupted by the courtesan,

1:18:22.793 --> 1:18:27.168
considers the possibility
of earning such a sum

1:18:27.334 --> 1:18:32.043
by whatever means necessary.

1:19:33.626 --> 1:19:37.959
"Lusignan, the favourite,
mustn't win. Understand?

1:19:38.126 --> 1:19:40.043
"Do what you have to."

1:19:49.418 --> 1:19:53.459
"Nana must win the Grand Prix."

1:21:39.584 --> 1:21:45.084
Maréchal the bookmaker,
a former coachman for Vandeuvres,

1:21:45.251 --> 1:21:48.168
and now his stooge.

1:22:08.043 --> 1:22:12.918
"Take all bets on Lusignan
onto my account.

1:22:13.126 --> 1:22:16.251
"And at any odds."

1:22:26.876 --> 1:22:29.709
"The favourite? That's insane!"

1:22:40.043 --> 1:22:43.543
"Don't worry. It won't win.

1:22:43.668 --> 1:22:48.543
"I'll cover you
by putting it in writing."

1:23:29.251 --> 1:23:35.084
"But what about Nana, Count?"

1:23:40.334 --> 1:23:45.918
"Oh, my poor friend! No chance!"

1:24:14.876 --> 1:24:22.376
"My poor Satin, men are so silly!"

1:24:43.668 --> 1:24:46.918
"Look, I'm wearing your colours."

1:26:31.668 --> 1:26:36.459
"Would you be so good as to go,
on my behalf,

1:26:36.626 --> 1:26:40.043
"and lay two thousand louis
on Nana."

1:26:50.543 --> 1:26:55.793
And the innocent La Faloise,

1:26:56.001 --> 1:27:01.793
knowing nothing of the dealings
between Vandeuvres and Maréchal,

1:27:01.959 --> 1:27:07.709
picks the one bookmaker
he should have avoided.

1:27:47.668 --> 1:27:53.376
"What a clever gentleman,
betting on Nana!"

1:28:27.168 --> 1:28:30.709
Maréchal, seeing La Faloise

1:28:30.876 --> 1:28:34.668
take the betting slip to Vandeuvres,

1:28:34.834 --> 1:28:38.501
is at a loss to explain
his patron's actions.

1:32:04.626 --> 1:32:08.918
"Nana's won! I've been swindled!"

1:33:29.418 --> 1:33:32.084
"Thief! Thief!"

1:33:53.918 --> 1:33:58.918
<i>I authorise you to accept</i>
<i>on my account</i>

1:33:59.084 --> 1:34:04.501
<i>all bets on Lusignan</i>

1:34:04.668 --> 1:34:10.834
<i>up to a limit of 2,000 louis.</i>

1:34:17.793 --> 1:34:21.709
"He was betting
against his own horse.

1:34:21.876 --> 1:34:26.293
"He knew it wouldn't win."

1:34:40.501 --> 1:34:45.876
"He cleaned me out
of a hundred thousand francs..."

1:34:56.501 --> 1:35:00.751
"which that gentleman
laid on Nana for him!"

1:36:01.376 --> 1:36:03.793
"Bah, sir!"

1:36:46.334 --> 1:36:49.876
Nana, totally unaware,

1:36:50.084 --> 1:36:53.459
drifts among these catastrophes,

1:36:53.626 --> 1:36:57.793
concerned solely
with her own beauty.

1:39:23.126 --> 1:39:25.751
Her favourites...

1:39:30.501 --> 1:39:33.251
Her lapdog...

1:39:37.626 --> 1:39:40.501
Her hairdresser...

1:41:02.834 --> 1:41:05.418
"Count de Vandeuvres!"

1:42:05.918 --> 1:42:10.126
"Nana, I dishonoured myself
for your sake."

1:42:25.418 --> 1:42:28.334
"My life is destroyed.

1:42:28.459 --> 1:42:32.668
"But I can rebuild it
if you will consent to marry me."

1:43:41.709 --> 1:43:44.334
"You pauper!

1:43:44.501 --> 1:43:47.834
"You can't imagine
I'll support you!"

1:45:11.626 --> 1:45:16.084
"I too offer you my name."

1:45:23.668 --> 1:45:26.293
"I love you."

1:45:37.793 --> 1:45:39.584
"You're just a baby.

1:45:39.751 --> 1:45:43.459
"If I twisted your nose,
milk would drip out!"

1:46:22.001 --> 1:46:27.709
"I've had my fill of the uncle,
the nephew and their hard times!"

1:47:42.584 --> 1:47:46.959
Muffat,
on his way to the Tuileries...

1:48:57.334 --> 1:49:01.459
"Listen to me.
I must talk to you about Nana."

1:49:12.168 --> 1:49:17.751
"In the name of the friendship
we once had, beware of her.

1:49:17.918 --> 1:49:23.959
"She's a golden fly
who poisons everything she touches."

1:50:22.626 --> 1:50:25.584
"I know, my friend."

1:51:02.668 --> 1:51:06.543
Georges cannot drag himself away

1:51:06.751 --> 1:51:10.418
from the room next to the bathroom,

1:51:10.626 --> 1:51:13.918
a room filled with the heady scent

1:51:14.084 --> 1:51:17.084
of Nana's dresses.

1:55:21.751 --> 1:55:25.793
The older man enters,
bedecked with gold.

1:55:48.084 --> 1:55:52.251
"You look gorgeous in fancy-dress,
my little Mufe!"

1:57:14.418 --> 1:57:17.126
"Do you want a sweet?"

1:57:40.709 --> 1:57:43.584
"Sit up and beg,
there's a good boy!"

1:58:51.626 --> 1:58:53.959
"Down!"

1:59:52.584 --> 1:59:56.293
Georges, witnessing this baseness,

1:59:56.459 --> 1:59:59.293
is overwhelmed
with shame and jealousy.

2:02:28.209 --> 2:02:32.126
"Muffat, don't leave me alone!"

2:03:20.751 --> 2:03:24.168
Vandeuvres is resolved
to end it all.

2:04:05.543 --> 2:04:09.751
"Take this, my friends,
and leave me.

2:04:09.918 --> 2:04:12.543
"I need to be alone."

2:05:47.293 --> 2:05:51.043
Nana, left alone with her terror...

2:07:17.876 --> 2:07:23.543
Haunted by the memory
of Georges' blood...

2:07:30.168 --> 2:07:33.043
An indelible stain.

2:09:02.918 --> 2:09:06.126
<i>My dear Nana...</i>

2:10:53.084 --> 2:10:59.043
The Countess has grown tired
of Muffat's loose living.

2:12:34.751 --> 2:12:39.001
Gossip about Vandeuvres' suicide

2:12:39.168 --> 2:12:41.709
spreads through Paris.

2:13:19.043 --> 2:13:20.793
And Bordenave,

2:13:20.959 --> 2:13:23.918
accompanied by Rose Mignon,

2:13:24.084 --> 2:13:26.418
the star of his theatre,

2:13:26.543 --> 2:13:28.751
and his whole troupe,

2:13:28.918 --> 2:13:30.668
brings Nana

2:13:30.834 --> 2:13:33.918
the most heartfelt consolations

2:13:34.126 --> 2:13:36.293
of his repertoire.

2:13:53.126 --> 2:13:56.043
"Don't forget that you're an artist.

2:13:56.209 --> 2:13:58.584
"Your life is public property,

2:13:58.751 --> 2:14:00.459
"it isn't your own.

2:14:00.584 --> 2:14:02.751
"Be stoic in the face of grief

2:14:02.918 --> 2:14:04.418
"and come with us.

2:14:04.543 --> 2:14:06.876
"You must keep up appearances.

2:14:07.043 --> 2:14:08.376
"Come!"

2:14:23.876 --> 2:14:27.168
Meanwhile, Countess Muffat,

2:14:27.334 --> 2:14:30.251
an unenthusiastic lover,

2:14:30.418 --> 2:14:33.668
is heading
to a more melancholy fate.

2:15:05.376 --> 2:15:09.168
Muffat, worried about Nana...

2:15:50.876 --> 2:15:53.501
"Is anyone there?"

2:17:07.751 --> 2:17:09.876
"You dare to laugh

2:17:10.043 --> 2:17:14.084
"when madam
must be sick with despair!"

2:17:18.084 --> 2:17:21.334
"She's not that bothered, really.

2:17:21.501 --> 2:17:24.209
"She's at the ball."

2:17:30.918 --> 2:17:33.543
"Enough!"

2:18:17.501 --> 2:18:21.251
BALL

2:22:20.209 --> 2:22:22.543
"The cancan, Nana!"

2:25:40.751 --> 2:25:44.834
"What are you doing here,
my little Mufe?"

2:26:46.793 --> 2:26:50.418
"Nana, this life cannot go on.

2:26:50.584 --> 2:26:55.084
"Either it ends
or we must separate."

2:27:13.918 --> 2:27:17.709
"You come here to blame me?

2:27:17.876 --> 2:27:22.418
"I who have my hand on my heart?"

2:27:29.418 --> 2:27:33.709
"All you think of is having fun."

2:27:46.501 --> 2:27:49.543
"Fun, fun...

2:27:49.709 --> 2:27:53.918
"Do you really think I enjoy it?"

2:28:28.084 --> 2:28:32.584
"They come to my home
and misbehave,

2:28:32.751 --> 2:28:38.876
"they hurt me,
they call me a loose woman..."

2:28:56.084 --> 2:28:59.543
"You're so oblivious,
it's frightening.

2:28:59.668 --> 2:29:02.084
"Farewell, Nana."

2:29:19.668 --> 2:29:22.209
"Mufe... That damn Mufe!

2:29:22.418 --> 2:29:25.876
"To think I nearly loved that!"

2:29:42.876 --> 2:29:45.543
"Muffat, my darling..."

2:30:26.376 --> 2:30:31.668
"What's this? Crying over a man?"

2:30:52.459 --> 2:30:56.376
"I've had my fair share of men,

2:30:56.501 --> 2:30:59.209
"diamonds and pearls...

2:30:59.376 --> 2:31:02.668
"They used to call me
Queen Pomaré."

2:31:15.876 --> 2:31:18.876
"Go and fetch Nana."

2:33:01.043 --> 2:33:04.751
And it is
with a desperate impassibility

2:33:04.918 --> 2:33:09.459
that Muffat receives
a final blow from fate.

2:33:16.543 --> 2:33:21.501
<i>The indignity of your conduct</i>
<i>dishonours us both</i>

2:33:21.668 --> 2:33:25.709
<i>and scandalises the Tuileries,</i>

2:33:25.876 --> 2:33:30.751
<i>forcing me to leave a home</i>
<i>which is no longer mine.</i>

2:33:30.918 --> 2:33:33.626
<i>Farewell, Sabine Muffat.</i>

2:35:10.834 --> 2:35:13.709
The rats desert the sinking ship.

2:36:46.876 --> 2:36:50.584
With all Nana's servants now fled,

2:36:50.751 --> 2:36:53.334
after all-out pillaging,

2:36:53.501 --> 2:36:56.876
she comes home
to a deserted mansion,

2:36:57.084 --> 2:37:01.293
seriously ill,
carried by her friends.

2:39:26.543 --> 2:39:32.168
Bosc enters with the doctor.

2:39:39.043 --> 2:39:42.959
"It's a puzzling condition, doctor.

2:39:43.126 --> 2:39:45.501
"A fit of nerves,

2:39:45.668 --> 2:39:49.293
"and then a fever.
A terrible fever!"

2:40:22.626 --> 2:40:25.959
A few moments later...

2:40:48.001 --> 2:40:50.834
"It's smallpox!"

2:43:24.001 --> 2:43:27.584
"Don't go up, Count!

2:43:27.709 --> 2:43:30.376
"It's contagious!"
