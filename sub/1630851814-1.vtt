01:56.783 --> 01:58.743
<i>It's been two years, everyone.</i>

01:59.577 --> 02:02.747
The dreadful past two years
I'd rather not remember!

02:02.831 --> 02:06.334
As an unprecedented pandemic
swept across the country,

02:06.417 --> 02:10.004
<i>companies crumbled and families</i>
<i>were forced out onto the streets.</i>

02:10.505 --> 02:13.883
<i>Not to mention the ungrounded</i>
<i>propaganda against the privileged,</i>

02:13.967 --> 02:15.885
<i>which lead to arson, terrorism,</i>

02:17.178 --> 02:18.346
<i>and in the end…</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:20.181
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

02:20.765 --> 02:23.351
<i>The Gwanghwamun riot!</i>

02:36.197 --> 02:40.326
<i>Financial crisis</i>
<i>is now a thing of the past.</i>

02:46.666 --> 02:48.459
<i>Let's now put it all behind us.</i>

02:48.543 --> 02:50.295
<i>I will change everything.</i>

02:50.378 --> 02:52.297
<i>That pandemic we were so fed up with?</i>

02:53.298 --> 02:55.466
<i>We finally extinguished it!</i>

02:56.134 --> 02:58.344
-Restore the economy!
-Restore the economy!

02:58.428 --> 03:00.805

the man chosen
by our dear respectable citizens,

03:43.723 --> 03:47.477
will revive Korea once again at all cost,

03:47.560 --> 03:50.271
and restore its glory!

03:50.355 --> 03:53.066
I will sacrifice myself for this task!

03:56.027 --> 03:58.071
Exaggerating himself
when he's under the spotlight…

03:58.154 --> 04:00.698
It seems like
he can't fix that habit, isn't he?

04:00.782 --> 04:03.243
What can you expect from a former clown?

04:04.702 --> 04:08.748
To revive our nation,
we need to restore law and order first.

04:08.831 --> 04:13.336
<i>The strong judicial reforms</i>
<i>that I have rolled out will soon begin.</i>

04:13.419 --> 04:16.381

<i>Judge Kang Yo-han, dubbed the</i>

<i>will deliver once and for all</i>

<i>what you've always wanted.</i>
<i>A trial where justice stands!</i>

04:31.020 --> 04:35.775
And it was I, Heo Jung-se,
who made this possible!

04:35.858 --> 04:39.237
So let's change Korea, once and for all!

05:22.238 --> 05:24.782
<i>Good evening, I am Kang Yo-han.</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:35.585
Judge Kang, what are your thoughts
on the controversy on <i>Live Court Show</i>?

05:35.668 --> 05:39.005
Some say it goes against human rights
and that this is all for show.

05:39.088 --> 05:42.258
Some also worry about your martinetism
and lack of consideration

05:42.342 --> 05:43.968
for the socially disadvantaged.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.095
-Who is socially disadvantaged?
-Pardon?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.806
Out of my previous defendants,
who was the socially disadvantaged?

05:49.640 --> 05:52.018
Well, there was a youth offender,

05:52.101 --> 05:55.063
a homeless man, and a mentally ill--

05:55.146 --> 05:58.691
A rapist who preyed on his classmates,
a serial robber, and a random killer…

05:58.775 --> 06:00.777
Are they really
the "socially disadvantaged?"

06:00.860 --> 06:03.863
-Still, there is a consensus that--
-They are just defendants.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.075
I'm not interested in
who is the powerful or the powerless.

06:07.158 --> 06:10.578
Then are you confident about imposing
severe punishment this time too?

06:10.661 --> 06:13.581
President Joo Il-do
is known to have strong connections.

06:13.664 --> 06:15.875
If his group exerts pressure--

06:15.958 --> 06:17.710
I am the authority.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.213
I, me, Kang Yo-han!

06:20.296 --> 06:21.756
I am the power.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.181
And I will exercise jurisdiction
entrusted to me

06:30.264 --> 06:33.684
by our people,
who are the sovereign power.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.021
There is no one who is above our people.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.984
<i>Our citizens are the authority.</i>

06:42.568 --> 06:43.986
I'll see you in court, then.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.507
He's good.

07:04.590 --> 07:05.758
Tell me about it.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.267
Congratulations, Mr. Celebrity Judge.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.326
Shall we have a toast too?

07:35.997 --> 07:39.083
Here's to power that's sexy.

07:58.019 --> 08:00.396
<i>And I will exercise jurisdiction</i>
<i>entrusted to me</i>

08:00.480 --> 08:03.691
<i>by our people,</i>
<i>who are the sovereign power!</i>

08:03.774 --> 08:07.862
<i>There is no one who is above our people.</i>
<i>Our citizens are the authority.</i>

08:47.276 --> 08:48.694
One second. Excuse me.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.364
What are you here for?

08:52.365 --> 08:54.242
I've been seconded here to work,
starting today.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.496
You're our judge for <i>Live Court Show</i>.
Please go in.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.729
Yes, come in.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.524
Professor.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.026
Sorry, I mean "Justice Min."

09:29.110 --> 09:31.362
It still hasn't stuck with me.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.365
Forget the damned "Justice," you punk.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
Wow, you're looking good.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.286
You punk.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.169
It's like a temple here.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.338
It is a temple.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.427
A temple of justice.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.933
So this is the courthouse?

10:02.059 --> 10:04.437
They're going to air it live.
The trial, I mean.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.233
Why is Judge Kang Yo-han
taking things this far?

10:09.317 --> 10:13.154
Judge Kang?
But he's not your average judge.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.491
He is the herald of reforms
for our corrupt judiciary,

10:17.575 --> 10:20.828
and a ray of hope for the sinking Korea.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.331
Yes, I noticed he's very popular.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.750
They say in times of turmoil,
a monster will appear.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.586
Those nonsense laws he's passed…

10:28.669 --> 10:32.298
They could only come from someone
in politics, not someone in law.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.178
You detest him that much,

10:37.678 --> 10:39.847
yet you had to include me
in the judicial panel.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.186
We'll need that someone, won't we?

10:46.020 --> 10:50.107
<i>That someone who'll remain firm</i>
<i>in this crazy storm.</i>

10:51.192 --> 10:54.195
<i>There is no one here</i>
<i>who will go against the wind.</i>

10:54.278 --> 10:57.823
Are you telling me to be Judas?

11:00.534 --> 11:01.661
I'm begging you.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.789
Do you remember
what I'd always say in my lectures?

11:06.290 --> 11:07.166
I do.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.132
There is no easy justice
in the mortal world.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.149
It's nice to meet you.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.380
What is it, may I ask?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.591
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.552
So your name is Kim Ga-on?

11:59.635 --> 12:01.429
-Yes, I look forward--
-Welcome.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.347
To the battlefield.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.881
HUSBAND-AND-WIFE OWNERS
OF POPULAR RESTAURANT

12:40.176 --> 12:41.594
TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE

12:41.677 --> 12:44.764
HR PROFILE: KIM GA-ON

12:44.847 --> 12:46.056
I see a resemblance.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.100
More so than I'd expected.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.868
Judge Kim Ga-on?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.664
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Oh Jin-ju.

13:10.748 --> 13:14.084
-It's nice to meet you, Judge Oh.
-Sorry, things are still unsettled here.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.754
I'm from a long way from here,
so I have a lot of things.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.924
No, it's fine.
So you're going to sleep here?

13:20.007 --> 13:22.092
Oh no. Maybe not every day, but…

13:22.176 --> 13:25.054
You know the basic tenets
for any organization.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.515
Making a good impression
by working hard at the start.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.725
I see.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.186
Your first placement
was in Seoul, wasn't it?

13:32.686 --> 13:33.729
Yes.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.190
I'd been stuck elsewhere
ever since I was appointed judge,

13:36.273 --> 13:38.275
so this is my first time working in Seoul.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.612
Let's be honest.
A chance like this doesn't come often.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.786
Well, are you the shy type?

13:49.620 --> 13:52.164
Not at all.
I look forward to working with you.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.878
Your image is a lot different
when you smile.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.881
Now I see what they were looking for
in their judicial panel.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.299
What do you mean by that?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.678
Well, if you want me to be frank with you…

14:06.720 --> 14:08.055
public image, I'd say?

14:08.138 --> 14:11.475
I see. But does that have
anything to do with our work as judges?

14:11.559 --> 14:12.560
Yes, of course.

14:12.643 --> 14:13.477
Think about it.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.647
We're the judicial panel to stand
before the entire nation.

14:16.730 --> 14:19.275
And people have a tendency
to believe the words

14:19.358 --> 14:22.903
from someone who's charming,
than someone who's right.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.615
In other words, charm is power.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.368
-Power?
-Yes.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.249
Don't take me too seriously.
I'm in such a good mood right now

14:35.332 --> 14:38.043
that I'm saying all these things
without thinking twice.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.589
To be honest with you,

14:43.257 --> 14:45.134
I'm a big fan of Judge Kang.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.430
In fact, I was blessed to just come here.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.434
You finally made it, Jin-ju.
Let's work hard.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.358
Any second thoughts on taking the case

15:01.442 --> 15:04.028
of President Joo Il-do of JU Chemicals
as your first trial?

15:04.111 --> 15:06.447
That case is the most appropriate one.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.700
But there are simpler
and easier cases though.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.870
There's no need for concern,
as long as we go by the law.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.583
But he'll round up
the best lawyers in this country.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.043
I suspect so.

15:19.126 --> 15:22.755
You know that the public trust
in our judiciary has hit in the teens.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.381
Yes.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.261
So why take a difficult case
for the public trial

15:29.345 --> 15:33.057
where much discrepancy is expected
between the public sentiment and--

15:33.140 --> 15:34.183
Chief Justice.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.895
<i>The Live Court Show</i>
is not a kangaroo court.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.648
It is a transparent one
with our citizens bearing witness.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.277
And that's all that I need.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.291
I'll get going now.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.627
-Sure, see you tomorrow.
-Bye.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.180
Now let's cross the road.
Hold your right hand up!

16:13.263 --> 16:15.391
That's right.
Follow me, and come this way.

16:27.778 --> 16:28.946
You bastards!

16:35.911 --> 16:39.123
-Prepare to fire.
<i>-Stand by at the barrier gate.</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:42.292
<i>A bus that's 200 meters away</i>
<i>is headed for the gate at full speed.</i>

16:42.376 --> 16:44.878
<i>Driver ID is unknown.</i>
<i>Further instructions needed.</i>

16:44.962 --> 16:48.757
What is going on?
My goodness. Kids, hurry up!

17:54.990 --> 17:56.158
Are you all right?

18:01.830 --> 18:03.749
These guns were distributed
for you to fire.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.084
My apologies, Judge Kang.

19:15.612 --> 19:16.822
Are you okay, mister?

19:36.592 --> 19:39.595
PUNISH PRESIDENT JOO IL-DO!

19:39.678 --> 19:42.181
<i>This morning, a kindergarten school bus</i>

19:42.264 --> 19:44.308
<i>exploded in front of the Supreme Court.</i>

19:44.391 --> 19:46.977
<i>The driver, angered by the news</i>
<i>that the warrant</i>

19:47.060 --> 19:49.897
<i>for President Joo Il-do's arrest</i>
<i>was dismissed…</i>

19:49.980 --> 19:51.398
What's this about now?

19:51.982 --> 19:54.818
So he did that
because the warrant was dismissed?

19:54.902 --> 19:57.571
It's only an act of defiance
against government authority.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.989
With all due respect,

19:59.072 --> 20:01.700
I wouldn't say defiance,
but a desperate cry.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.203
What do you mean, a desperate cry?

20:04.286 --> 20:06.371
Even rats go frantic and smash their heads

20:06.455 --> 20:09.041
if you confine them in a tiny space
and starve them.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.127
What makes you think
humans would be any different?

20:15.130 --> 20:18.050
Chairman Seo,
now the issue is about survival.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.885
We need the foundation's help.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.678
We managed to vanquish the pandemic,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.806
but with everyone out of jobs,
we have no one to collect taxes from.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.975
A long drought will instigate a riot.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.227
Exactly.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.103
-President Park.
-Yes.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.689
How are the preparations
for the <i>Live Court Show</i>?

20:32.773 --> 20:34.942
You don't need to worry a thing.
It'll be a hit.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.985
You'll have to prepare well,

20:37.569 --> 20:40.405
because Minister Cha here is
very much interested in this.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.448
For personal reasons.

21:16.441 --> 21:20.070
<i>Social Responsibility Foundation</i>
<i>for a safe Korea…</i>

21:24.324 --> 21:26.118
WELFARE FOR THE POOR

21:26.201 --> 21:28.620
LUCKY LOANS

22:09.911 --> 22:11.955
Are you building a jungle here?

22:12.789 --> 22:13.623
You're home.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.959
I heard there was a terrorist attack
at the Supreme Court.

22:17.544 --> 22:18.920
You heard about it already?

22:19.588 --> 22:22.007
As expected
from Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon of WAIS.

22:23.383 --> 22:26.345
You're not hurt, are you?
You didn't jump in again like--

22:26.428 --> 22:29.890
There you go again. Don't worry.
I was hiding at the very back.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.224
Like a real man.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.728
Good. You've finally matured.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.021
Let's go up.

22:36.104 --> 22:38.315
Go ahead first, let me finish up this one.

22:38.398 --> 22:41.109
Enough of that. Let's go in already.

22:41.735 --> 22:44.112
-Why are you getting mad again?
-Come on, hurry up.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.616
Cheers.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.330
So you're not going to treat me?

22:53.914 --> 22:55.999
-Why should I?
-Aren't you going to be on TV?

22:56.583 --> 22:59.544
It'll be difficult to meet you
if you become famous like judge Kang.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.506
-Celebrity? I wouldn't mind that.
-Why are you being so cynical?

23:03.090 --> 23:04.007
Cheers.

23:04.716 --> 23:05.759
Just drink up.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.389
It's not entirely your loss
working with a celebrity like Kang Yo-han.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.265
I mean, the guy has a story.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.518
The heir to an enormous fortune,

23:14.601 --> 23:16.103
and the survivor of a tragedy.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.271
People rave about things like that.

23:20.857 --> 23:24.069
Right, it's very different from mine.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.695
Hey, don't say that.

23:28.323 --> 23:31.118
Now that you've become a judge
after going through all that,

23:31.201 --> 23:33.161
you should move to a nicer neighborhood.

23:33.245 --> 23:37.082
-What's wrong with this neighborhood?
-It's changed too much.

23:37.165 --> 23:39.167
-But this is the only place that's left.
-For what?

23:40.877 --> 23:42.546
To remember Mom and Dad by.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.178
-Have dinner before you go.
-Dinner?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.764
You lost weight.
You've been skipping meals again, right?

23:54.307 --> 23:55.308
Hey.

23:56.393 --> 23:58.895
If you do this to me,
I might end up asking you out again.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.318
Though you rejected me five times
since kindergarten,

24:05.402 --> 24:07.279
it's not over until it's really over.

24:07.362 --> 24:09.573
I don't want to lose a good friend.
Stay for dinner.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.366
-Are you done with this?
-Yes.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.535
You heartless bastard.

24:14.536 --> 24:15.579
I love you, you know!

24:33.597 --> 24:35.557
President Joo Il-do is claiming

24:35.640 --> 24:37.851
that he knew nothing
about the wastewater leak.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.686
That it was just an accident.

24:39.769 --> 24:43.064
If the public sentiment leans
towards the judges during the trial,

24:43.148 --> 24:44.316
what's our next card?

24:44.399 --> 24:45.942
We'll have to emphasize

24:46.026 --> 24:48.111
that the sewage purification facility
was damaged.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.780
And that it was an unfortunate accident
brought upon by the city's…

24:50.864 --> 24:53.450
-President Joo.
-Hi, Mr. Oh.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.579
Would you agree
that the media is making a big fuss?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.333
Those ungrateful hyenas.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.753
There are tens of thousands of dogs,
feeding on the crumbs off my table.

25:04.836 --> 25:06.463
They won't be able to find

25:06.546 --> 25:08.548
any clear evidence
for environmental disputes.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.760
How would the CEO even know
the wastewater composition?

25:11.843 --> 25:13.094
We'll argue for not guilty.

25:13.178 --> 25:15.096
Even if things don't go as we planned,

25:15.180 --> 25:17.307
it'll be professional negligence at worst.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.476
Professional negligence…

25:22.103 --> 25:23.647
What's the penalty for that?

25:24.147 --> 25:26.608
Five years of imprisonment
is the maximum penalty.

25:26.691 --> 25:27.526
Five years?

25:27.609 --> 25:30.028
Recently, we had all kinds
of special acts coming into force,

25:30.111 --> 25:32.489
but because the courthouse
is very conservative,

25:32.572 --> 25:35.116
they won't be able to vamp it up
so much at once.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.370
Don't you know I can't even sleep a wink

25:38.453 --> 25:40.413
without my prescribed mattress?

25:40.497 --> 25:42.457
Goodness, President.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.835
Just think of it
as a one-year meditation retreat,

25:45.919 --> 25:48.213
and we'll have you released on parole.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.715
You'll be walking out
in better health too.

25:51.925 --> 25:52.968
Are you sure?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.762
If you're still anxious,

25:58.223 --> 25:59.683
we always have him.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.438
Yes, that's right.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.320
Sir.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.200
About yesterday,
thank you for saving my life.

26:17.951 --> 26:18.868
You're welcome.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.704
I saw you fired without hesitation.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.209
Did I?

26:27.502 --> 26:29.254
Were you going to kill the driver?

26:29.337 --> 26:31.172
-If it was necessary, yes.
-Pardon?

26:31.256 --> 26:34.759
The bus would have continued on
even if the driver died on the spot.

26:34.843 --> 26:37.220
You shot that gun
so he'd turn the wheel by instinct.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.016
-And he'd be the only one dead.
-Isn't that how math works?

26:41.683 --> 26:43.435
One is a smaller number than two.

26:45.729 --> 26:46.855
Yes, you're right.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.064
<i>So, about Kang Yo-han.</i>

26:49.608 --> 26:50.942
What did you think of him?

26:53.028 --> 26:54.154
Well…

26:54.237 --> 26:56.948
-I lived, thanks to you.
-You're welcome.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.909
I guess I shouldn't be the smaller number,
not in front of you.

27:01.202 --> 27:02.454
Whatever suits you.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.249
Why do you think Kang Yo-han
chose President Joo Il-do

27:06.333 --> 27:09.127
as the first defendant
for this <i>Live Court Show</i>?

27:11.087 --> 27:14.466
Isn't it because there is
high public interest on this case?

27:14.549 --> 27:16.509
Yes, you're right. But…

27:17.385 --> 27:21.514
He is also one of the highest contributors
to the Social Responsibility Foundation.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.351
Kang Yo-han's judicial reforms
were only possible

27:24.434 --> 27:27.062
because it was backed
by the Minister of Justice

27:27.145 --> 27:29.230
and the Social Responsibility Foundation.

27:31.816 --> 27:35.153
In other words, he purposely chose
a case that would place him

27:35.236 --> 27:36.571
in an awkward situation?

27:38.823 --> 27:41.701
I'm wondering
if he has an ulterior motive.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.085
Judge Kang,
about that bus driver from yesterday.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.836
How about we indict him

27:51.920 --> 27:54.297
without detention for now,
and put him on trial?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.008
Why do you want to do things that way?

27:57.092 --> 27:59.094
With the <i>Live Court Show</i>
just around the corner,

27:59.177 --> 28:01.596
we wouldn't want to gain attention.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.391
There's also what you did yesterday too.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.518
Aren't first impressions important,
after all?

28:09.062 --> 28:12.482
"Show compassion to a terrorist."
Is that what you're saying?

28:14.776 --> 28:16.736
I'm not telling you to show compassion,

28:16.820 --> 28:18.780
I'm telling you not to lose face.

28:18.863 --> 28:20.865
Then there's no reason
to be concerned about that.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.410
The more noise there is,
the more attention we'll get.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.370
Others deploy
noise marketing as their strategy.

28:25.870 --> 28:28.832
It's fair that we detain him
for something like this.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.876
Well…

28:31.960 --> 28:33.420
May I add in something?

28:34.963 --> 28:37.257
That bus driver's three-year-old daughter

28:37.340 --> 28:39.551
is one of the victims
of the JU Chemicals case.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.678
Not only that, her grandmother

28:42.429 --> 28:44.347
took her life as a result.

28:44.431 --> 28:45.432
So what?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.145
So I'm wondering if it's really fair
to detain that bus driver

28:50.228 --> 28:54.357
when we dismissed the warrant
for President Joo Il-do's arrest.

28:54.441 --> 28:55.650
Judge Kim!

28:55.734 --> 28:58.528
Joo Il-do is a defendant who is innocent
until proven guilty in court,

28:58.611 --> 29:00.363
but the bus driver's a flagrant offender.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.157
Don't you know that much?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.659
But there are grounds
to extenuate his actions--

29:04.743 --> 29:06.870
Do you have the right
to harm people for being a victim?

29:06.953 --> 29:09.289
Not really, but he's currently injured--

29:09.372 --> 29:11.458
There are doctors
at detention centers too.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.045
Let's go by the book.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.933
<i>After the young victim</i>
<i>of the JU Chemicals Wastewater Leak</i>

29:29.017 --> 29:33.062
<i>died in hospital during treatment,</i>
<i>her guilt-ridden grandmother</i>

29:33.146 --> 29:36.149
<i>took her own life,</i>
<i>resulting in yet another tragedy.</i>

29:36.232 --> 29:38.902
<i>This brings</i>
<i>the total number of deaths to 11.</i>

29:38.985 --> 29:41.738
<i>If we include those victims</i>
<i>who are in treatment,</i>

29:41.821 --> 29:43.740
<i>the number goes up to 47.</i>

29:43.823 --> 29:46.284
<i>The exact details of the case</i>
<i>are under investigation,</i>

29:46.367 --> 29:48.745
<i>and President Joo Il-do will soon stand…</i>

29:50.830 --> 29:52.874
Sorry, but it's a little hard to watch.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.836
It's reminded me of where I used to live.
I'm a country bumpkin, you see.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.379
Though I don't look it.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.715
Well, I'm a Seoulite,
as you can plainly see.

30:01.716 --> 30:04.010
-From the shantytown?
-Can you tell?

30:04.093 --> 30:05.428
Yes.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.265
I guess the poor ones
recognize each other.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.267
As if we have a radar for that.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.437
Then what do you see in Judge Kang?

30:15.772 --> 30:17.148
You mean Judge Kang Yo-han?

30:19.275 --> 30:20.109
Well…

30:23.822 --> 30:25.365
I see nothing.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.535
The tenets of office life.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.538
Never harbor unnecessary curiosity
for your bosses.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.415
-Let's just focus on work.
-All right.

30:34.499 --> 30:38.628
Oh, there's an ordinance
that came into force. Read it.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.213
-Ordinance?
-Yes.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.131
For our <i>Live Court Show</i>.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.510
It may anger you a little.

30:58.940 --> 31:02.026
Sir, don't you think you're a little
obsessed with playing with numbers?

31:02.527 --> 31:05.738
You'll make the ruling based on the number
of votes by our audience?

31:05.822 --> 31:09.450
Do you call that "playing with numbers"?
I call it democracy.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.704
If you want a democratic trial,
then why do you need us?

31:12.787 --> 31:15.456
-I guess you read the ordinance.
-You call that a trial?

31:19.419 --> 31:22.171
Why do you need us
if you're going to make the final ruling

31:22.255 --> 31:25.174
based on numbers
even if the panel has a point to make?

31:25.258 --> 31:27.552
We need emergency measures
for emergencies.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.554
Besides, it won't look nice.

31:30.763 --> 31:32.015
It won't look nice?

31:32.098 --> 31:34.267
It'll feel empty
if there is no one besides me.

31:34.350 --> 31:35.560
It is a show, after all.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.619
<i>It's me. There's something</i>
<i>I need you to do for me.</i>

31:52.702 --> 31:53.912
Yes, what is it?

31:53.995 --> 31:56.164
<i>The spare key</i>
<i>to the Supreme Court Archives.</i>

31:56.998 --> 31:58.791
Hey, you think it's that easy?

31:58.875 --> 32:02.337
If you can't even manage that much,
I recommend you quit your job.

32:03.004 --> 32:03.838
<i>Hello?</i>

32:04.672 --> 32:07.091
Who was it again,
that dragged me into this?

32:07.175 --> 32:10.136
Tampering with case records
will get you imprisoned.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.223
I won't tattle on the accomplice, sir.

32:40.833 --> 32:41.918
Found it.

32:42.669 --> 32:43.753
You're it.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.345
You persistent little punk.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.764
So you dug through the records
from 20 years ago?

32:55.473 --> 32:58.601
They say your first love
will always be dear to you.

33:00.019 --> 33:00.979
First love?

33:02.939 --> 33:06.526
When President Joo first got into trouble
while expanding his business,

33:06.609 --> 33:09.070
it was Cha Gyeong-hui who excused him.

33:09.153 --> 33:11.906
<i>But that wasn't the only time.</i>
<i>It was three times, in fact.</i>

33:11.990 --> 33:14.701
<i>And very discreetly.</i>
<i>Of course, that didn't come for free.</i>

33:16.577 --> 33:19.372
When Cha Gyeong-hui
first entered politics,

33:19.455 --> 33:21.207
who do you think sponsored her?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.293
Joo Il-do?

33:26.796 --> 33:28.047
In other words,

33:28.131 --> 33:31.718
Joo Il-do is Minister Cha's sponsor
since her days as a prosecutor.

33:32.301 --> 33:35.722
And Cha Gyeong-hui is the one
who backed Kang Yo-han all this time.

33:35.805 --> 33:36.681
Yet Kang Yo-han

33:37.849 --> 33:41.310
had to pick Joo Il-do,
out of all people, for the trial.

33:42.061 --> 33:47.025
But Cha Gyeong-hui continues
to watch on, without opposition.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.944
Do you think this is a trial
to shed light on his crimes,

33:51.654 --> 33:52.905
or the very opposite?

33:54.741 --> 33:57.952
The problem is,
these are all just suspicions.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.749
I'll have to dig into it,
using whatever means.

34:02.832 --> 34:05.585
I have a feeling
I'm digging my own career grave,

34:08.129 --> 34:10.006
but it's already too late to go back.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.227
First love, did you say?

34:25.480 --> 34:26.981
How is Su-hyeon doing?

34:33.029 --> 34:33.863
<i>Hey, Ga-on.</i>

34:34.447 --> 34:35.448
It's okay, go on.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.326
A wiretapping device?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.036
Why would you need such a thing?

34:42.622 --> 34:44.749
-Help!
-Stay still.

34:45.374 --> 34:46.709
Hey, I'll call you back.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.004
Stop right there!

34:51.672 --> 34:53.841
Police. Step back!

34:54.675 --> 34:56.052
Help me…

34:56.135 --> 34:58.429
-She's our sister.
-Stand against the wall.

35:00.848 --> 35:03.017
I'm telling you, she's our sister.

35:04.727 --> 35:05.937
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.022
-Please help me…
-It's okay.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.817
You're fine now. I'm an officer.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.993
DELIVER JUSTICE WITH YOUR RULING!
A SAFE KOREA IS NOW ABOUT TO GET REAL

36:15.756 --> 36:19.260
<i>Minister, Director Jung</i>
<i>from the SRF is here to see you.</i>

36:20.219 --> 36:22.013
-Tell her to come in.
-<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

36:30.438 --> 36:33.858
Hello, Minister.
I'm here on behalf of Chairman Seo today.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.027
What is his business?

36:38.404 --> 36:41.991
If you don't mind, may I sit down first?

36:44.535 --> 36:45.661
Thank you.

36:58.299 --> 37:01.886
Not just Chairman Seo,
but many of our sponsors are

37:01.969 --> 37:04.680
quite concerned for this upcoming trial.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.599
What concerns?

37:07.934 --> 37:12.104
Please excuse me, but let me be direct.

37:12.188 --> 37:15.274
"Let's beat down
on petty criminals to appease the public."

37:15.358 --> 37:18.444
Wasn't that the motive
behind this <i>Live Court Show</i>?

37:19.362 --> 37:20.279
And?

37:20.363 --> 37:23.366
So is there a need
to pick a corporate case?

37:23.449 --> 37:24.992
If it results in heavy penalties,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.620
then it'll set a bad precedent
for all businessmen.

37:28.704 --> 37:30.623
Those are the concerns.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.001
Have you ever seen
Kang Yo-han make a mistake?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.378
That's true, yes…

37:35.461 --> 37:39.298
But you still could have picked
a simpler case for the first trial.

37:40.633 --> 37:44.387
Just why are you so obsessed
with this particular case?

37:45.054 --> 37:46.264
Did you say, "obsessed"?

37:47.682 --> 37:51.185
I'm sorry, but I'm only the messenger.

37:56.148 --> 37:59.443
Why are the members
of a social welfare foundation…

37:59.527 --> 38:02.280
Or should I say, the conglomerate alliance

38:02.363 --> 38:05.366
so nosy about state affairs?

38:05.866 --> 38:08.244
I'm sure I clearly said
I have it all under control.

38:08.744 --> 38:10.204
How rude.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.048
My apologies, Minister.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.342
I stepped out of line.

38:37.898 --> 38:42.903
But if you don't mind,
may I do so one last time?

38:44.864 --> 38:48.534
That chair you're sitting in,
and that desk,

38:48.617 --> 38:51.370
as well as the painting
and the car you drive to work…

38:52.204 --> 38:55.916
Are you aware
they were all funded by our foundation?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.544
We don't have much budget
for the Ministry of Justice this year.

38:58.627 --> 39:02.548
On top of that, we're also forced to build
private correctional facilities too.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.927
Which is why I'm curious, Minister.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.348
I'm just curious to know

39:11.932 --> 39:13.726
who is really running this country.

39:27.740 --> 39:28.866
What?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.702
Why would a judge need
a wiretapping device?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.914
Do you have a girlfriend
who is cheating on you?

39:34.997 --> 39:37.291
If that's a viable excuse,
then I'll say yes.

39:37.375 --> 39:41.379
-I can accept it, but I can't forgive you.
-Let's just go with it even if you can't.

39:41.962 --> 39:44.632
Enough with your jokes.
Where do you want to use this?

39:49.345 --> 39:51.555
You'll get hurt
if you try to know too much.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.934
But then again,
you've always had to have it your way…

39:55.434 --> 39:57.228
Let's see if it works.
Go out on the rooftop.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.479
-The rooftop?
-Yes.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.607
Hey, you need to put this on you.

40:10.783 --> 40:14.286
What are you looking at?
You can't do anything by yourself, right?

40:15.496 --> 40:18.165
You shouldn't beat up
innocent civilians, detective.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.300
<i>Can you hear me, Judge Kim Ga-on?</i>

40:29.301 --> 40:30.803
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

40:30.886 --> 40:33.055
Just kidding, you punk. Love you.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.602
Her voice was nice, at least.

40:41.605 --> 40:42.857
Were you able to hear me?

40:43.524 --> 40:45.192
-Very well.
-And your answer?

40:46.193 --> 40:48.863
I'm supposed to pretend
I heard nothing while wiretapping.

40:48.946 --> 40:52.575
So you won't answer me?
Fine, go catch your cheating girlfriend.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.370
Hey, I've been called in.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.955
-I'll call you.
-Again?

40:58.038 --> 40:59.039
Yes.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.667
-Bye!
-Bye, stay safe.

41:05.629 --> 41:07.214
Yes, I'm on my way now.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.349
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

41:17.433 --> 41:20.060
<i>Just kidding, you punk. Love you.</i>

41:23.772 --> 41:25.107
<i>Will you marry me?</i>

41:25.191 --> 41:26.484
<i>Just kidding, you punk.</i>

41:26.567 --> 41:27.735
<i>Love you.</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:28.712
Hey.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.117
Take care, then.

44:24.703 --> 44:25.871
Judge Kim?

44:27.956 --> 44:30.959
-You're here early today, sir.
-The trial's just around the corner.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.713
So what are you doing here?

44:36.590 --> 44:37.966
The library was locked.

44:39.426 --> 44:40.302
But in the dark?

44:41.053 --> 44:43.597
I have good night vision.

44:49.144 --> 44:50.104
Please excuse me, then.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.360
Yes?

45:00.239 --> 45:02.157
-You live on your own, you said?
-Yes.

45:04.660 --> 45:05.786
It's tough, isn't it?

45:06.745 --> 45:08.372
Your shirt's crinkled.

45:09.915 --> 45:12.042
I just couldn't find the time to iron it.

45:13.335 --> 45:14.503
I see.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.381
Well, keep it up.

45:24.805 --> 45:26.098
What an interesting kid.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.401
JUDGE KIM GA-ON

45:45.909 --> 45:47.035
Hello, Minister.

45:47.661 --> 45:48.746
<i>Hey, Judge Kang.</i>

45:49.246 --> 45:51.123
It's about the <i>Live Court Show</i>.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.460
I have my complete faith in you,
Judge Kang.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.087
<i>There is no need to worry.</i>

45:57.171 --> 45:58.672
Justice will stand.

45:59.673 --> 46:01.633
<i>I'm sure the citizens aren't that foolish.</i>

46:04.052 --> 46:06.597
It's me. Is it all ready?

46:07.264 --> 46:08.682
<i>And did you meet with that Doc?</i>

46:09.183 --> 46:10.517
<i>So what did you say?</i>

46:11.393 --> 46:13.353
<i>Good. Yes, good work.</i>

46:14.730 --> 46:16.356
I'll meet with his attorney tonight.

47:05.531 --> 47:06.865
That's Joo Il-do's lawyer.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.377
-May I have your name for the reservation?
-Kang Yo-han.

47:42.359 --> 47:45.779
The judge met with the defending attorney
right before the trial,

47:45.863 --> 47:49.324
and talked with the Minister who is
suspected to have ties with the defendant?

47:50.576 --> 47:52.077
And who is this "Doc"?

47:53.662 --> 47:55.247
It all looks suspicious, yes,

47:55.914 --> 47:59.543
but you know that alone
isn't enough to prove anything.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.130
He can always give the excuse
that it was for legal proceedings,

48:03.213 --> 48:04.590
and as for the phone call,

48:05.966 --> 48:08.093
all he said was that justice will stand.

48:11.847 --> 48:13.807
But the trial is tomorrow.

48:14.850 --> 48:20.063
I'll have to keep my eyes open
and watch in the courtroom.

48:21.231 --> 48:24.109
Improve the classification system
for building use

48:24.192 --> 48:28.030
so that facilities for new technology
such as EV charging stations

48:28.113 --> 48:30.115
can be installed
at the hearts of our cities,

48:30.699 --> 48:33.619
and make the blueprint public
while establishing a hub.

48:33.702 --> 48:36.038
Also, followed by laying out a roadmap

48:36.121 --> 48:38.457
to utilize information on…

48:40.292 --> 48:42.336
Continue.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.088
There's something I can't miss today.

48:48.592 --> 48:53.305
LIVE COURT SHOW WILL START SOON

48:54.514 --> 48:56.141
Let's see how talented

48:57.100 --> 48:58.977
Judge Kang Yo-han is, then. Shall we?

49:26.505 --> 49:28.966
<i>Father, forgive them,</i>

49:29.049 --> 49:32.344
<i>for they do not know what they do.</i>

49:55.993 --> 49:57.327
Thirty seconds!

49:58.245 --> 50:00.330
-Prepare the insert screens.
-Yes, sir.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.707
Sound check.

50:03.125 --> 50:06.878
<i>It's exciting for us</i>
<i>average citizens to take part,</i>

50:06.962 --> 50:10.590
<i>and I think it's great to see</i>
<i>our opinions reaching a consensus.</i>

50:10.674 --> 50:13.969
<i>If you committed a sin,</i>
<i>you should be punished for it.</i>

50:14.052 --> 50:16.638
<i>And fairly too, regardless of</i>
<i>whether you're rich or not.</i>

50:16.722 --> 50:18.390
<i>They're counting our votes</i>

50:18.473 --> 50:21.059
<i>and it makes me think</i>
<i>that it'll be a proper trial.</i>

50:21.143 --> 50:22.394
This is going to be fun!

50:23.186 --> 50:25.731
<i>The first trial of the</i> Live Court Show
<i>will take place today.</i>

50:25.814 --> 50:28.066
<i>With the faith</i>
<i>in our judiciary at an all-time low,</i>

50:28.150 --> 50:31.236
<i>will the </i>Live Court Show
<i>be able to turn things around?</i>

50:31.319 --> 50:34.239
<i>Our citizens are now eagerly</i>
<i>waiting for their first trial,</i>

50:34.322 --> 50:36.742
<i>praying that all will be treated fairly</i>
<i>before the law.</i>

50:36.825 --> 50:38.910
<i>All eyes are now on Judge Kang</i>
<i>and his judiciary panel</i>

50:38.994 --> 50:41.288
<i>on whether they will meet</i>
<i>the expectations.</i>

51:01.016 --> 51:03.351
Hello to all of our citizens!

51:03.435 --> 51:07.230
I'm currently standing at the center
of history, here at the courthouse.

51:07.314 --> 51:10.233
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>in our Constitution's history,</i>

51:10.317 --> 51:12.903
<i>a</i> Live Court Show <i>awaits</i>
<i>your participation.</i>

51:12.986 --> 51:14.738
<i>And it's very easy to do so.</i>

51:16.323 --> 51:20.327
<i>As you can see on the screen,</i>
<i>first install the app,</i>

51:20.410 --> 51:23.038
<i>"Goddess of Justice, Dike,"</i>
<i>and tap on the statue.</i>

51:23.121 --> 51:25.707
<i>You'll then be able to see</i>
<i>the current trial</i> <i>in session.</i>

51:25.791 --> 51:28.001
-Mommy!
-Gyu-bin. Come have some mandarins.

51:28.085 --> 51:33.298
<i>Below the screen,</i>
<i>you'll also see two buttons.</i>

51:33.882 --> 51:35.842
<i>While watching the trial,</i>

51:35.926 --> 51:39.304
if your judgment is
that they must be punished,

51:40.722 --> 51:42.265
<i>press the red button.</i>

51:42.349 --> 51:46.394
<i>If not, please press the other button.</i>

51:46.478 --> 51:49.981
<i>Your opinions</i>
<i>will be collected in real time,</i>

51:50.065 --> 51:52.400
<i>graphed, and sent to the judicial panel.</i>

51:52.484 --> 51:55.987
Our judicial panel will then
see your opinions in real-time

51:56.071 --> 51:59.866
<i>and make their judgment based on them.</i>

51:59.950 --> 52:03.787
Let me introduce to you now,
our presiding judge today…

52:04.371 --> 52:06.832
Judge Kang Yo-han!

52:15.382 --> 52:16.341
My fellow citizens.

52:16.925 --> 52:20.929
Your court is now in session.

52:29.187 --> 52:31.106
<i>No longer will we see trials</i>

52:31.189 --> 52:34.151
<i>in a league of their own</i>
<i>which ignores the common sense.</i>

52:34.943 --> 52:37.195
<i>All proceedings will be made open</i>

52:37.279 --> 52:39.573
<i>and transparent</i>
<i>to hear our people's voices.</i>

52:39.656 --> 52:41.074
We will rule by the law,

52:41.158 --> 52:43.076
but never disregard your will.

52:43.869 --> 52:45.203
You are the owners

52:45.287 --> 52:47.831
<i>and the power of this court.</i>

52:52.961 --> 52:55.922
DEFENDANT

53:02.095 --> 53:03.221
Have the lights ready.

53:09.728 --> 53:14.941
Let's now meet with our case today.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.818
Prosecution, you may proceed.

53:16.902 --> 53:19.070
PROSECUTOR

53:31.291 --> 53:32.959
DEFENDANT

53:34.878 --> 53:37.797
There is a village
where all its young population has left.

53:41.009 --> 53:42.552
Total population, 47.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.971
Average age, 72 years old.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.973
<i>Of them, 11 have passed away,</i>

53:47.557 --> 53:50.101
<i>and 23 are still in intensive care.</i>

53:50.185 --> 53:53.897
Thirteen of them have been discharged
but they suffer severe complications

53:53.980 --> 53:56.107
such as respiratory distress
and neuropathy.

53:57.525 --> 54:00.153
One of the victims
who died was just three years old,

54:00.737 --> 54:02.989
and another is her grandmother.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.658
Her daughter left her child with her,

54:04.741 --> 54:07.786
but when she died,
she had taken her own life.

54:09.037 --> 54:12.749
<i>Her granddaughter had been</i>
<i>the only child in this village.</i>

54:13.750 --> 54:16.962
And the culprit of this tragedy
is sitting right there!

54:17.545 --> 54:20.465
JU Chemical's Plant 4,
which is operated by our defendant,

54:20.548 --> 54:22.926
was located just five kilometers away
from this village.

54:23.009 --> 54:26.179
<i>And they had dumped toxic chemicals</i>
<i>into the streams and rivers</i>

54:26.263 --> 54:29.140
<i>without adequate purification.</i>

54:29.224 --> 54:30.892
<i>Yes, into the very waters</i>

54:30.976 --> 54:33.812
<i>that the residents drank,</i>
<i>washed with, and used for their farming!</i>

54:35.563 --> 54:36.606
My fellow citizens,

54:39.192 --> 54:40.402
this is murder.

54:43.822 --> 54:46.032
-What, already? Bring it up on the screen!
-Yes.

54:49.035 --> 54:49.911
INNOCENT

54:49.995 --> 54:53.623
GUILTY

55:02.382 --> 55:07.429
We enjoyed that statement
of defense from the Prosecution,

55:07.512 --> 55:09.347
or should I say, propaganda?

55:09.431 --> 55:10.932
Watch your words.

55:11.016 --> 55:15.979
We have just witnessed
the dangers of a media trial.

55:16.062 --> 55:18.023
A trial is not a movie.

55:18.106 --> 55:19.482
Nor is it a show.

55:19.566 --> 55:23.778
A trial is a proceeding to establish
the truth with objective evidence.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.906
You had just called it murder,

55:26.990 --> 55:30.744
but what psycho businessman
would murder people on purpose?

55:30.827 --> 55:32.662
As long as he dumped toxic wastewater,

55:32.746 --> 55:35.248
aware that it may kill people,

55:35.332 --> 55:37.625
this is murder by willful negligence.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.920
I'd like to ask you all
to take a look at the screen.

55:42.839 --> 55:45.675
As you can see,
the embankment at the rear of the plant

55:45.759 --> 55:48.803
had collapsed,
damaging the purification system.

55:48.887 --> 55:51.806
Prosecutor, when I studied law,
I learned it is the local government

55:51.890 --> 55:54.768
who is responsible
for managing such embankments.

55:54.851 --> 55:56.811
Or am I remembering it wrong?

55:56.895 --> 55:59.397
It is true
that this incident caused partial leaks.

55:59.481 --> 56:01.941
However, the plant stopped
operating immediately

56:02.025 --> 56:03.610
for an emergency repair,

56:03.693 --> 56:06.696
so in all, the total leakage time
was no more than an hour.

56:06.780 --> 56:07.947
Your Honor.

56:08.448 --> 56:11.618
What more could we have done?

56:11.701 --> 56:12.994
This was beyond our control.

56:13.078 --> 56:16.831
Are you sure there was no previous leakage
due to the aged facility?

56:17.749 --> 56:18.958
Do you have evidence?

56:19.042 --> 56:22.837
Are you asking whether we have evidence
after replacing all those parts

56:22.921 --> 56:24.672
that may turn out to be problematic?

56:24.756 --> 56:28.176
In other words, you have none. Understood.

56:28.259 --> 56:31.388
Well, looks like the only point
we've managed to prove so far is that

56:31.471 --> 56:34.307
there was temporary leakage
due to an uncontrollable incident.

56:34.391 --> 56:37.060
But nothing about the circumstances
before the incident.

56:37.143 --> 56:39.312
According to deductions
by an appraisal agency,

56:39.396 --> 56:42.148
a leakage that lasted just an hour
could not have--

56:42.232 --> 56:43.775
Deductions, did you say?

56:43.858 --> 56:46.069
I must have heard that incorrectly.

56:46.152 --> 56:50.115
-Is that objective evidence?
-He's absolutely right.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.411
How could you accuse

56:54.494 --> 56:57.414
a patriotic businessman
of being a murderer?

56:57.497 --> 57:01.709
Do you know how many people
are able to make a living thanks to me?

57:01.793 --> 57:05.463
We have about 17,400 employees
at JU Chemicals,

57:05.547 --> 57:08.800
and if you consider their families
and our partners too,

57:08.883 --> 57:11.010
we're burdened
with the lives of hundreds of thousands.

57:11.094 --> 57:14.722
-So to use this propaganda trial--
-Watch your words, President Joo!

57:14.806 --> 57:17.392
I have the right to speak also!

57:17.475 --> 57:18.810
President Joo!

57:21.563 --> 57:23.606
INNOCENT, GUILTY

57:26.693 --> 57:28.361
Why isn't he saying anything?

57:28.445 --> 57:29.737
This is not good.

57:29.821 --> 57:31.489
Hey, get the ads ready.

57:36.369 --> 57:38.788
-Defense, return to your seat.
-Yes, Your Honor.

57:39.706 --> 57:40.623
Wait.

58:00.018 --> 58:02.312
-President Joo.
-Yes, Your Honor.

58:02.896 --> 58:04.105
Please resume your seat.

58:04.731 --> 58:05.982
Oh… yes.

58:07.775 --> 58:09.152
DEFENDANT

58:32.759 --> 58:35.178
Are both sides done
presenting their cases?

58:35.261 --> 58:36.804
Yes, Your Honor.

58:36.888 --> 58:39.474
We'll take a short break before we resume.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.059
Take a bio break.

59:03.373 --> 59:05.875
Your Honor, may I ask a question?

59:07.710 --> 59:09.003
Proceed.

59:10.755 --> 59:13.841
The embankment you mentioned
collapsed on the very night

59:13.925 --> 59:17.845
following the first victim's death.

59:17.929 --> 59:19.097
Is that correct?

59:19.180 --> 59:20.306
Yes, that is correct.

59:21.182 --> 59:22.892
I must say, what a coincidence.

59:22.976 --> 59:26.646
How could such an incident
could have taken place

59:26.729 --> 59:29.899
right after we saw the first victim,
erasing all evidence?

59:29.983 --> 59:31.359
My apologies, but Your Honor,

59:31.442 --> 59:34.112
but our argument is
that the first victim's CoD is unclear

59:34.195 --> 59:37.448
and irrelevant to this case.

59:38.199 --> 59:41.327
According to his diagnosis,
the symptoms he suffered include vertigo,

59:41.411 --> 59:43.121
headaches and loss of consciousness,

59:43.204 --> 59:46.499
and they aren't so different
from what other victims reported.

59:46.583 --> 59:50.003
Those are deductions. Also, an autopsy
was never performed for his case.

59:50.086 --> 59:53.423
There is no evidence that traces
of toxic chemicals were detected.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.926
-Your Honor.
-You may proceed.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.845
For a more objective opinion,

59:58.928 --> 1:00:00.972
I'd like to call Dr. Yoo Jong-baek,

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:03.808
a leading expert
on heavy metal intoxication, as a witness.

1:00:03.891 --> 1:00:05.268
Yes, go ahead.

1:00:05.351 --> 1:00:08.146
<i>Is it all ready?</i>
<i>And did you meet with that Doc?</i>

1:00:20.742 --> 1:00:25.163
Before we start, I appreciate you
taking the time to attend the trial.

1:00:25.246 --> 1:00:26.581
Please.

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:29.125
The stream water sample
that was submitted as evidence…

1:00:29.208 --> 1:00:30.293
There it is.

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:31.794
You analyzed it, have you not?

1:00:31.878 --> 1:00:34.380
What are your opinions
as an expert in this field?

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:39.761
While many of the victims show
symptoms of heavy metal poisoning,

1:00:39.844 --> 1:00:42.347
I have reservations
about whether the wastewater leakage

1:00:42.430 --> 1:00:43.848
is the sole cause.

1:00:43.931 --> 1:00:47.143
It's easy to think
that exposure to heavy metals

1:00:47.226 --> 1:00:50.229
is only a risk in certain environments,
such as factories.

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:51.648
But that's not the case.

1:00:51.731 --> 1:00:54.901
<i>Heavy metals exist all around us</i>
<i>in our daily lives.</i>

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:56.944
<i>Crops that were harvested</i>
<i>from contaminated soil.</i>

1:00:57.028 --> 1:00:59.989
<i>Cosmetics. They're something</i>
<i>we're exposed to every day.</i>

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:02.492
Especially this village is the first

1:01:02.575 --> 1:01:05.953
to be affected by particulate matter,
which carries heavy metals,

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:07.664
and there is an impact from pesticide

1:01:07.747 --> 1:01:09.874
and chemical fertilizers
as a farming village.

1:01:09.957 --> 1:01:14.212
<i>So, to compare that</i>
<i>against this much leakage…</i>

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:16.297
<i>Well, it's hard to say.</i>

1:01:17.006 --> 1:01:18.633
<i>Dr. Yoo, I also have a question.</i>

1:01:19.425 --> 1:01:21.010
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

1:01:21.094 --> 1:01:25.181
You just said, "this much leakage."

1:01:25.264 --> 1:01:26.683
But leakage of what, exactly?

1:01:28.810 --> 1:01:30.812
There was a mix
of different chemicals, and--

1:01:30.895 --> 1:01:33.106
Which chemical was detected the most?

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:37.443
Well…

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:40.697
-it's something called KCN--
-Please put it into simple words for us.

1:01:42.615 --> 1:01:43.741
KCN.

1:01:44.659 --> 1:01:46.452
What is its full name?

1:01:48.121 --> 1:01:49.372
Dr. Yoo?

1:01:53.543 --> 1:01:55.044
Potassium cyanide, Your Honor.

1:01:55.128 --> 1:01:58.256
-Potassium cyanide?
-Potassium cyanide!

1:01:58.339 --> 1:01:59.674
Number seven!

1:01:59.757 --> 1:02:01.426
JU CHEMICALS LOOKED ON AS KCN WAS LEAKED?

1:02:03.261 --> 1:02:05.555
I know the word may sound scary,

1:02:05.638 --> 1:02:08.307
but KCN really is common.

1:02:08.391 --> 1:02:10.560
Yes, it's actually very common.

1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:12.395
You find it in almonds,

1:02:12.478 --> 1:02:15.898
apple seeds, apricot seeds, cherry seeds,
ginkgo nuts, and even peach seeds.

1:02:15.982 --> 1:02:18.735
They're not always harmful.
It's the concentration.

1:02:19.318 --> 1:02:21.279
-Yes, it's all about the concentration.
-Dr. Yoo.

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:25.992
Right in the vicinity was a village
where most of its residents were elderly.

1:02:26.075 --> 1:02:28.411
Can you still claim it was insignificant?

1:02:28.995 --> 1:02:30.788
-I'm sorry, but--
-Well…

1:02:31.789 --> 1:02:35.585
Your Honor. I'm sure
you know the law better than I do,

1:02:35.668 --> 1:02:38.421
and the same goes for me.
I know more in this field.

1:02:38.504 --> 1:02:39.964
Science is all about the fact.

1:02:40.047 --> 1:02:42.341
It's not up to the public sentiment.

1:02:42.425 --> 1:02:43.551
Dr. Yoo!

1:02:43.634 --> 1:02:44.594
Judge Kim.

1:02:46.512 --> 1:02:49.056
That's enough. No more.

1:02:51.809 --> 1:02:53.644
Dr. Yoo, you are excused.

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:55.605
-Yes, Your Honor.
-You may step down.

1:02:56.272 --> 1:02:58.691
You must be exhausted
after what was a long testimony.

1:02:58.775 --> 1:02:59.984
Please take some water.

1:03:00.067 --> 1:03:02.487
-Sir…
-Will the Clerk give him some water?

1:03:09.786 --> 1:03:10.870
Thank you.

1:03:16.292 --> 1:03:17.794
Hold on, that water…

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:20.713
Are you sure it wasn't mixed up
with that water sample?

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:23.633
What the hell?

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:27.720
Your Honor, no.

1:03:27.804 --> 1:03:29.680
The evidence is right here.

1:03:31.474 --> 1:03:35.102
I apologize, my mistake.
But they looked so similar.

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:36.354
I apologize, Dr. Yoo.

1:03:36.437 --> 1:03:38.022
You said it's fine!

1:03:46.113 --> 1:03:47.448
How embarrassing.

1:03:48.407 --> 1:03:50.952
If you have no more to say,
you may leave, Dr. Yoo.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:55.206
I shouldn't have done it!

1:03:56.123 --> 1:03:58.042
That was bloody embarrassing.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:04:00.253
This is all because of that President Joo.

1:04:02.547 --> 1:04:04.173
Jeez, what's with me?

1:04:21.232 --> 1:04:24.694
Your Honor, I will now examine
our next witness, Jang Gi-hyeon,

1:04:24.777 --> 1:04:27.321
who is the site manager
of the plant concerned.

1:04:28.155 --> 1:04:29.532
Mr. Jang.

1:04:29.615 --> 1:04:32.660
You have been at this plant
for 12 years now.

1:04:32.743 --> 1:04:34.912
There were no issues
with the purification facility

1:04:34.996 --> 1:04:36.998
before the embankment collapse,
were there?

1:04:41.127 --> 1:04:45.381
Mr. Jang. Didn't you already testify so
to the investigative authorities?

1:04:45.464 --> 1:04:47.383
Where is your answer?

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:50.177
Well…

1:04:55.600 --> 1:04:58.603
-Let me organize my thoughts.
-Mr. Jang.

1:04:58.686 --> 1:05:00.396
-Mr. Jang!
-President Yoo.

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:03.149
-Yes?
-Resume your seat.

1:05:04.191 --> 1:05:05.401
I apologize, Your Honor.

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:07.278
You may proceed.

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:08.779
Yes, Your Honor.

1:05:08.863 --> 1:05:11.699
There's actually something
I'd like to say.

1:05:11.782 --> 1:05:13.784
Mr. Jang, what…

1:05:13.868 --> 1:05:16.454
There had been leakage
even before the incident.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:20.207
I still don't understand
why the embankment

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:21.709
collapsed all of a sudden

1:05:21.792 --> 1:05:23.753
after 30 years of standing strong.

1:05:23.836 --> 1:05:25.463
What I can assure you is

1:05:25.546 --> 1:05:27.965
that there had been leakage
even before then.

1:05:28.049 --> 1:05:29.675
Because it was a serious matter,

1:05:30.509 --> 1:05:33.095
-I'd even alerted the President…
-Mr. Jang!

1:05:33.179 --> 1:05:34.138
Counsel.

1:05:35.181 --> 1:05:36.432
Resume your seat.

1:05:39.852 --> 1:05:41.062
Mr. Jang.

1:05:41.604 --> 1:05:43.105
You can take your time.

1:05:46.359 --> 1:05:48.861
I told him the facility has aged
and that there will be

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:51.822
serious consequences
if we don't act upon it immediately,

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:55.076
but President Joo said not to waste money
because the plant will be

1:05:55.159 --> 1:05:57.578
relocating next year
and not to make a big fuss over nothing.

1:05:57.662 --> 1:05:59.205
-Mr. Jang!
-All right.

1:05:59.288 --> 1:06:01.791
And what was your answer
upon hearing his words?

1:06:02.375 --> 1:06:06.504
I asked what if something happens
to the elderly in the village.

1:06:06.587 --> 1:06:07.880
And?

1:06:07.964 --> 1:06:08.798
President Joo said,

1:06:12.718 --> 1:06:16.180
"Those old geezers lived long enough,
so who cares?"

1:06:16.263 --> 1:06:18.808
Mr. Jang, when did I say such a thing?

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:22.979
"Those old geezers lived
long enough, so who cares?"

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:26.941
Did you really say such a thing?

1:06:28.859 --> 1:06:30.194
Deep down I thought,

1:06:31.862 --> 1:06:33.864
"Isn't this murder?"

1:06:33.948 --> 1:06:36.993
Can we really do this as human beings?

1:06:37.076 --> 1:06:38.160
No, that's not true.

1:06:38.244 --> 1:06:41.747
Your Honor, I said no such thing!

1:06:42.665 --> 1:06:44.041
Murder?

1:06:45.876 --> 1:06:48.796
My colleagues call me "Dr. Safety."

1:06:50.256 --> 1:06:53.676
I'd worked my entire life adhering
to the safety manual, and now…

1:06:56.053 --> 1:06:58.097
I just want to die, Your Honor.

1:07:00.683 --> 1:07:03.144
<i>Is it all ready?</i>
<i>And did you meet with that Doc?</i>

1:07:03.227 --> 1:07:05.146
<i>May I call Dr. Yoo Jong-baek as a witness?</i>

1:07:05.229 --> 1:07:07.481
<i>My colleagues call me "Dr. Safety."</i>

1:07:12.737 --> 1:07:15.448
GUILTY

1:07:15.531 --> 1:07:17.825
<i>-Darn it.</i>
<i>-My goodness.</i>

1:07:18.659 --> 1:07:21.871
-Look at this jerk. He's complete trash.
-No need to watch anymore.

1:07:21.954 --> 1:07:22.872
It's a death penalty.

1:07:22.955 --> 1:07:24.665
<i>-Look at how shameless he is.</i>
<i>-Let's vote.</i>

1:07:24.749 --> 1:07:26.834
Death penalty!

1:07:28.377 --> 1:07:30.129
Your Honor, I really am innocent!

1:07:30.212 --> 1:07:32.339
It's all lies. I mean it!

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:34.050
I never said such a thing.

1:07:34.133 --> 1:07:36.469
"Those old geezers lived
long enough, so who cares?"

1:07:36.552 --> 1:07:38.262
Why would I say such a thing?

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:40.139
So you never said such words?

1:07:41.098 --> 1:07:43.350
-Then what did you say?
-Pardon?

1:07:43.434 --> 1:07:45.936
So you don't deny
meeting with our witness.

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:49.482
What did you say to him
when you met with him?

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:52.401
Well…

1:07:53.527 --> 1:07:54.653
President Joo.

1:07:55.529 --> 1:07:56.614
Please answer.

1:07:57.281 --> 1:07:59.450
Our entire nation is watching.

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:05.915
Because I have so many
roles and responsibilities,

1:08:05.998 --> 1:08:08.876
I don't remember
our exact conversation, Your Honor.

1:08:11.962 --> 1:08:13.756
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

1:08:13.839 --> 1:08:17.218
<i>Your Honor, I said no such thing!</i>

1:08:17.301 --> 1:08:18.511
<i>No, that's not true.</i>

1:08:18.594 --> 1:08:20.763
Are you taking our people as fools?

1:08:20.846 --> 1:08:22.181
No, Your Honor…

1:08:22.264 --> 1:08:25.392
"Those old geezers lived long enough?"
What do you mean by that?

1:08:25.476 --> 1:08:26.769
No, Your Honor!

1:08:26.852 --> 1:08:28.979
"I don't care if others die.
All I care about is money."

1:08:29.063 --> 1:08:32.149
Are you aware
that this is murder by willful negligence?

1:08:33.526 --> 1:08:34.610
President Joo.

1:08:39.156 --> 1:08:40.407
We'll argue for not guilty.

1:08:40.491 --> 1:08:44.495
Even if things don't go as we planned,
it'll be professional negligence at worst.

1:08:45.287 --> 1:08:47.248
Were you aware, President Joo?

1:08:48.457 --> 1:08:50.042
PROFESSIONAL NEGLIGENCE

1:08:53.337 --> 1:08:55.631
INNOCENT, GUILTY

1:09:00.094 --> 1:09:01.470
I'm sorry.

1:09:03.055 --> 1:09:06.767
It was true I received the report.

1:09:06.851 --> 1:09:09.854
So you admit you received
the report on the leakage?

1:09:09.937 --> 1:09:12.022
Yet you didn't care about the residents?

1:09:12.106 --> 1:09:13.274
No, Your Honor.

1:09:13.357 --> 1:09:14.358
Then what?

1:09:14.441 --> 1:09:16.527
What the hell is that bastard doing?

1:09:16.610 --> 1:09:19.780
-What's he playing at?
-Please calm down, Minister Cha.

1:09:19.864 --> 1:09:21.532
I'm sure he has a plan.

1:09:23.159 --> 1:09:24.785
Plan? What plan?

1:09:25.536 --> 1:09:28.289
Back then, I didn't think much of it.

1:09:28.998 --> 1:09:31.584
There wasn't a great amount
of leakage in the beginning,

1:09:31.667 --> 1:09:34.003
so little did I know
it would end up like this!

1:09:34.837 --> 1:09:36.422
Murder, did you say?

1:09:36.505 --> 1:09:38.215
Never, Your Honor.

1:09:41.427 --> 1:09:45.055
So you deny murder by willful negligence,

1:09:45.681 --> 1:09:49.685
but admit to professional negligence?

1:09:49.768 --> 1:09:53.564
<i>Joo Il-do is Minister Cha's sponsor</i>
<i>since her days as a prosecutor.</i>

1:09:53.647 --> 1:09:57.443
<i>And Cha Gyeong-hui is the one</i>
<i>who backed Kang Yo-han all this time.</i>

1:09:58.861 --> 1:10:01.947
<i>Is it all ready?</i>
<i>And did you meet with that Doc?</i>

1:10:02.031 --> 1:10:03.741
<i>I'll meet with his attorney tonight.</i>

1:10:03.824 --> 1:10:04.992
I'm sorry.

1:10:07.536 --> 1:10:09.496
It was my oversight.

1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:11.749
I was foolish

1:10:11.832 --> 1:10:14.627
not to think much of it…

1:10:17.254 --> 1:10:20.507
That plant was
due to be transferred anyway, right?

1:10:21.175 --> 1:10:23.928
I truly deserve to die.

1:10:27.348 --> 1:10:28.682
<i>There's no need to worry.</i>

1:10:28.766 --> 1:10:30.142
<i>Justice will stand.</i>

1:10:30.226 --> 1:10:31.936
<i>I'm sure our citizens aren't that foolish.</i>

1:10:32.019 --> 1:10:34.688
<i>I have my complete faith in you,</i>
<i>Judge Kang.</i>

1:10:37.524 --> 1:10:40.527
So he'll push for professional negligence.

1:10:40.611 --> 1:10:41.654
<i>Your Honor.</i>

1:10:42.154 --> 1:10:45.241
To find my client
guilty with homicide after a few words

1:10:45.324 --> 1:10:47.826
by our witness will turn this trial
a laughing stock.

1:10:47.910 --> 1:10:51.080
I ask you to make a firm ruling
under the rule of law.

1:10:52.164 --> 1:10:54.583
I will keep that in mind.

1:10:55.876 --> 1:10:58.045
We will take a short break
before delivering the verdict.

1:10:58.128 --> 1:10:59.129
Yes, Your Honor.

1:11:18.232 --> 1:11:20.150
You said a maximum of five years, right?

1:11:20.234 --> 1:11:23.696
Don't worry. It's not them who make
the decision to release on parole,

1:11:23.779 --> 1:11:24.989
but the Ministry of Justice.

1:11:25.072 --> 1:11:26.949
But murder?

1:11:27.783 --> 1:11:30.786
Why did Jang Gi-hyeon spew such lies?

1:11:37.167 --> 1:11:39.545
Judge Kang! Our show is a hit.

1:11:39.628 --> 1:11:41.964
Our ratings averaged 11.4%,

1:11:42.047 --> 1:11:44.174
and peaked at 14.7%!

1:11:44.258 --> 1:11:47.261
But most of all, the viewer ratings

1:11:47.344 --> 1:11:49.179
for the 20-30 age range exceeded 6%!

1:11:50.889 --> 1:11:53.142
-So we're a success?
-Yes, of course!

1:11:53.225 --> 1:11:54.560
Is this a reality show?

1:11:55.185 --> 1:11:59.481
No, that's not what I mean.
I mean this show interested the public.

1:12:04.403 --> 1:12:05.904
He's always a bit standoffish.

1:12:05.988 --> 1:12:07.531
-We'll be in your care.
-Sure.

1:12:11.618 --> 1:12:15.205
Don't they know how much I paid up
to get exclusive broadcasting rights?

1:12:17.499 --> 1:12:20.419
Our CEO will be grinning from ear to ear.

1:12:20.919 --> 1:12:23.047
But don't make it too obvious
how ecstatic you are.

1:12:23.964 --> 1:12:25.591
All right. You can have beef tonight.

1:12:26.842 --> 1:12:27.676
Bye.

1:12:30.387 --> 1:12:31.513
Buy us dinner.

1:12:31.597 --> 1:12:33.974
I'll buy you all the meals in this world!

1:12:34.808 --> 1:12:36.310
Someone made a lot of money.

1:12:48.572 --> 1:12:50.199
We will now deliver the verdict.

1:12:50.866 --> 1:12:54.536
<i>The court has taken the opinions</i>
<i>of our citizens with great consideration.</i>

1:12:55.913 --> 1:12:59.333
We had a hard time reaching a verdict,
but arrived at the conclusion

1:12:59.416 --> 1:13:03.629
that the evidence submitted alone
was not enough to convict willful murder.

1:13:07.674 --> 1:13:10.177
However, as the Defendant contended

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:13.680
this Court finds him guilty
of professional negligence

1:13:13.764 --> 1:13:15.557
on primary charges.

1:13:15.641 --> 1:13:17.017
The maximum penalty

1:13:17.101 --> 1:13:19.478
for professional negligence
is five years of imprisonment.

1:13:29.780 --> 1:13:30.948
However,

1:13:31.031 --> 1:13:33.617
in the judiciary reform bill
that was passed last year,

1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:36.370
there is the clause
which allows for imposing

1:13:36.453 --> 1:13:39.081
cumulative punishment for each victim.

1:13:40.749 --> 1:13:42.167
Don't tell me…

1:14:11.864 --> 1:14:12.990
Ms. Kim Sun-ja,

1:14:13.699 --> 1:14:14.950
Ms. Park Myeong-sun,

1:14:16.201 --> 1:14:17.453
Mr. Lee Jeong-ro,

1:14:18.412 --> 1:14:19.955
Mr. Bae Myeong-jae,

1:14:21.748 --> 1:14:23.876
Ms. Yoo So-yeong, our youngest victim,

1:14:27.838 --> 1:14:29.214
Mr. Lee Gap-bun,

1:14:31.925 --> 1:14:33.427
<i>Mr. Kim Dong-jae,</i>

1:14:35.471 --> 1:14:36.847
<i>Ms. Park Yong-sun,</i>

1:14:40.017 --> 1:14:41.268
<i>Mr. Hwang In-chan,</i>

1:14:42.311 --> 1:14:43.437
Mr. Kang Jeon-il,

1:14:44.813 --> 1:14:46.148
Ms. Koo Jong-ok,

1:14:47.858 --> 1:14:49.193
Mr. Kim Yu-chun,

1:14:50.861 --> 1:14:51.945
Ms. Jung Gwon-a,

1:14:52.821 --> 1:14:54.239
Ms. Park Mal-ja,

1:14:56.575 --> 1:14:58.035
Ms. Seon Yun-jeong,

1:14:58.827 --> 1:14:59.870
<i>Ms. Lee Myeong-suk…</i>

1:15:00.579 --> 1:15:02.831
-He sure knows how to impress.
-<i>Mr. Lee Seok-gyu.</i>

1:15:08.462 --> 1:15:09.880
and Ms. Won Yeong-seon.

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:20.682
11 DEAD
36 INJURED

1:15:30.609 --> 1:15:32.694
To our Defendant, who,
driven by his foolish greed,

1:15:33.487 --> 1:15:35.614
robbed the lives of the innocent

1:15:35.697 --> 1:15:38.867
<i>and caused lifelong suffering</i>
<i>to the survivors…</i>

1:15:40.786 --> 1:15:44.373
this Court imposes a cumulative punishment

1:15:44.456 --> 1:15:45.832
for each of the 47 victims!

1:15:53.173 --> 1:15:55.842
I sentence you to 235 years in prison.

1:15:55.926 --> 1:15:57.719
235 YEARS IN PRISON

1:16:00.097 --> 1:16:01.890
235 YEARS IN PRISON

1:16:10.857 --> 1:16:12.067
Stop the car for a bit.

1:16:30.002 --> 1:16:31.712
Is this even possible?

1:17:15.714 --> 1:17:16.882
May you live long.

1:17:17.591 --> 1:17:18.508
I mean it.

1:17:26.266 --> 1:17:30.646
But you clearly said five years…

1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:54.961
Your Honor!

1:17:56.088 --> 1:17:57.589
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:17:58.298 --> 1:17:59.758
Your Honor, thank you.

1:18:00.384 --> 1:18:02.761
Thank you.

1:18:02.844 --> 1:18:08.934
Thank you, Your Honor…

1:18:09.017 --> 1:18:11.061
Your Honor, thank you.

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:15.273
-Please get up.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

1:18:18.860 --> 1:18:22.614
I have no more regrets, Your Honor.

1:18:22.698 --> 1:18:26.326
Ms. Kim Sun-ja, who hanged herself
after losing her dear granddaughter

1:18:26.827 --> 1:18:28.203
is my sister.

1:18:28.286 --> 1:18:30.539
I tried so many times
to follow her footsteps,

1:18:31.415 --> 1:18:33.583
but life can be so cruel…

1:18:33.667 --> 1:18:35.877
It wouldn't grant me death
even if I wished for it.

1:18:55.772 --> 1:18:57.441
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:05.073
<i>So you deny murder by willful negligence,</i>

1:19:05.157 --> 1:19:07.325
but admit to professional negligence.

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:12.497
Show their photos one by one,
and I'll call on their names.

1:19:12.581 --> 1:19:14.124
Yes, Your Honor.

1:19:22.340 --> 1:19:24.718
Mr. Bae Myeong-jae, Mr. Lee Seok-gyu,

1:19:25.594 --> 1:19:27.763
and Ms. Yoo So-yeong, our youngest victim.

1:20:48.218 --> 1:20:50.345
THANK YOU TO JUNG JAE-SUNG
AND PARK HYUNG-SOO

1:20:50.428 --> 1:20:51.847
FOR THEIR SPECIAL APPEARANCE

1:21:14.244 --> 1:21:17.330
<i>I found it very touching.</i>
<i>I even teared up a bit.</i>

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:20.542
<i>Rule of law… Is the purpose of a trial</i>
<i>really to serve justice?</i>

1:21:20.625 --> 1:21:22.586
Pretending to have a heart
when you're merciless…

1:21:22.669 --> 1:21:25.255
It's all about selling hope
and receiving it back through fear.

1:21:25.338 --> 1:21:26.923
<i>What is it that you want from me?</i>

1:21:27.007 --> 1:21:28.174
<i>Prey.</i>

1:21:28.258 --> 1:21:31.011
<i>A man who has all the fun</i>
<i>by himself is not so charming.</i>

1:21:31.094 --> 1:21:32.429
<i>And pretty useless too.</i>

1:21:32.512 --> 1:21:34.014
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1:21:34.097 --> 1:21:36.600
You're just bait. And a fresh one at that.

1:21:36.683 --> 1:21:39.394
Maybe he hasn't been fully tamed.

1:21:39.477 --> 1:21:41.229
<i>That crazy bastard!</i>

1:21:44.608 --> 1:21:49.154
