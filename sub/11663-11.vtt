(mellow music playing)

01:06.500 --> 01:08.834
I simply do not believe it!

01:08.900 --> 01:09.900
What, Blanche?

01:09.967 --> 01:12.333
I just talked to somebody back home.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.633
They're doing the most horrible thing.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.066
They're tearing down
the most important building

01:17.133 --> 01:18.767
in Blanche Devereaux's family history.

01:18.834 --> 01:19.600
Oh, my God.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.767
They're tearing down Mattress World.

01:29.300 --> 01:30.900
Even worse than that.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.266
They're tearing down the place

01:33.333 --> 01:36.000
where I spent my happiest
childhood moments.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.834
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.567
They're tearing down Boys Town.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.834
Dorothy, they're tearing down
Grammy Hollingsworth's plantation.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.834
That beautiful place will be gone forever.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.934
I used to spend my summers there
and Christmas vacations

01:53.000 --> 01:56.166
and whenever there was a fight
between Big Daddy and Big Mommy.

01:56.233 --> 01:57.667
Big Mommy...

01:57.734 --> 02:00.834
Gee, I don't think
I ever knew her name before.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.500
I just don't believe you.

02:04.567 --> 02:05.767
When you were a child,

02:05.834 --> 02:09.266
didn't you have some beautiful,
fantastic place where you'd go

02:09.333 --> 02:11.867
and it would seem like a fairyland?

02:12.300 --> 02:14.767
Oh! That's right. You grew up in Brooklyn.

02:14.834 --> 02:15.500
Ugh!

02:17.467 --> 02:20.533
(Rose) Dorothy! Hurry, it's Sophia!
She's passed out!

02:20.600 --> 02:21.266
What?

02:23.800 --> 02:25.200
Oh, my God. Ma!

02:25.266 --> 02:27.800
I came in, she was choking.

02:28.266 --> 02:29.700
This isn't working.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.767
(dreamy music playing)

02:36.934 --> 02:38.100
Dorothy.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.633
Dorothy.

02:42.767 --> 02:43.700
Where am I?

02:43.767 --> 02:44.900
(man 1) Sophia.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.600
Welcome to heaven.

02:48.066 --> 02:49.200
I'm in heaven?

02:49.266 --> 02:50.200
That's right.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.266
Heaven, heaven? I went straight to heaven?

02:52.333 --> 02:53.834
No stops? No purgatory?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.367
Purgatory?

02:56.867 --> 02:59.266
Oh, ho ho ho. You Catholics.

02:59.333 --> 03:00.500
(laughs)

03:02.500 --> 03:04.800
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?

03:04.867 --> 03:09.233
I have to prepare for our next arrival,
and, actually, I'm rather excited.

03:09.734 --> 03:11.200
It's a televangelist.

03:11.266 --> 03:12.600
Why is that exciting?

03:12.667 --> 03:14.400
We've never had one here before.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.233
So, this is heaven.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.300
(Sal) Sophia! Sophia!

03:23.834 --> 03:25.033
Hey, who's that?

03:26.233 --> 03:27.266
Who's calling me?

03:27.834 --> 03:28.800
It's me.

03:28.867 --> 03:29.734
You know.

03:30.200 --> 03:30.867
(chuckles)

03:32.667 --> 03:34.133
Oh, Sal, is that you?

03:34.200 --> 03:35.700
Could it possibly be you?

03:35.767 --> 03:37.667
Oh, Sal, prove to me it's you.

03:39.066 --> 03:42.033
You dirty rat. You killed my brother.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.100
(groans)

03:44.166 --> 03:47.467
Oh, Sal, it is you.
You always did such a great Cagney.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.633
Sweetheart, how do you feel?

03:50.700 --> 03:52.000
How do I feel?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.700
I feel great. Hey, this is wonderful.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.500
My bunions don't hurt,
my arthritis is gone, and my teeth...

04:00.100 --> 04:00.967
are teeth!

04:03.300 --> 04:05.367
Here, all the parts work.

04:07.166 --> 04:08.900
Oh, I've missed you.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.166
And I missed you.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.233
I wish you knew how much.

04:13.567 --> 04:14.700
I'm not letting go.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.266
I'm never letting go.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.266
Come on, Rose! Come on!

04:19.333 --> 04:20.333
I'm trying! I'm trying!

04:20.400 --> 04:21.600
Try harder!

04:22.300 --> 04:23.767
(coughing)

04:23.834 --> 04:26.667
There you go, honey. There you go.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.300
(coughs)

04:29.266 --> 04:30.667
-Sal.
-(Dorothy sighs)

04:31.066 --> 04:31.734
Sal.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.467
Ma, are you okay?

04:33.533 --> 04:34.467
What happened?

04:34.533 --> 04:37.033
Ma, you were choking. You passed out.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.066
Rose saved your life.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.233
But I was in heaven with your father.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.767
I didn't want to come back.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.266
Thanks for nothing, you nitwit.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.567
Ma, stop that. Rose did save your life.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.200
Besides, you were not in heaven.

04:55.266 --> 04:57.033
You were probably just dreaming.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.734
You don't believe me.
Your father even sent a message.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.200
I'm sure he did,
but right now, you should calm down.

05:03.266 --> 05:04.800
We can talk about that later.

05:05.266 --> 05:07.200
Fine. Okay, if you think that's best.

05:07.667 --> 05:09.033
Oh, Ma.

05:10.033 --> 05:13.367
So anyway, Dorothy, like I was saying
about Grammy's plantation...

05:14.700 --> 05:16.367
Blanche, I cannot believe you!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.166
You're not talking about this till later.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.467
I know, but Ma almost died.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.767
She's got her color back, hasn't she?

05:25.233 --> 05:26.700
Really, Blanche!

05:26.767 --> 05:28.800
What could be so important
about a building?

05:28.867 --> 05:34.467
It was my home away from home
as a child, especially my bedroom.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.467
Grammy and I would have
all our late-night talks up there,

05:37.533 --> 05:39.667
and now they're tearing it down!

05:39.734 --> 05:41.066
That's terrible.

05:41.133 --> 05:46.600
Grammy's plantation was the one place
I consistently felt loved as a child.

05:46.667 --> 05:49.000
Now they're going to put a steel ball
through her house,

05:49.066 --> 05:50.467
through my room.

05:50.900 --> 05:53.800
Oh, don't you see?
It's like they're killing a part of me.

05:54.633 --> 05:55.600
Oh...

05:57.233 --> 05:58.367
Oh, poor Blanche.

05:58.433 --> 06:02.100
You know, I...
I actually do feel sorry for her.

06:02.166 --> 06:05.033
Oh, yeah. My heart goes out to her, too.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.166
Hello. Did I mention I died?

06:13.300 --> 06:14.233
Oh, hi, Ma.

06:14.300 --> 06:15.166
Where you been?

06:15.233 --> 06:15.967
Out.

06:16.033 --> 06:19.834
After yesterday, I decided to take
the time and stop and smell the roses.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.900
Ah, that's nice, Ma.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.533
Know where they have great roses?

06:23.600 --> 06:25.266
At the dog track in Lauderdale.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.133
By the way, your Bonneville shakes
when you go over 65.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.967
Ma, you were driving?
What is wrong with you?

06:35.033 --> 06:36.667
Do you have a death wish?

06:36.734 --> 06:39.967
No, I have a life wish.
I've seen the white light.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.700
Now I know there's a place for me,
I won't live in fear anymore.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.266
What's that on your blouse?

06:47.834 --> 06:49.200
See? I laugh in the face of death.

06:49.266 --> 06:51.200
(laughing)

06:51.767 --> 06:52.600
Ma, stop it.

06:52.667 --> 06:56.433
I don't want to hear about this dream
that's making you act reckless.

06:56.500 --> 07:00.233
The doctor says a lack of oxygen
made you hallucinate.

07:00.300 --> 07:03.500
I won't tell you what your father said.
I won't say another word.

07:03.567 --> 07:04.567
The light!

07:04.633 --> 07:06.400
I'm coming to you, Salley!

07:08.600 --> 07:12.667
Ma, enough with the white light.
You are making me crazy.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.467
Well, I'm off to Atlanta.

07:15.533 --> 07:16.667
You're going where?

07:16.734 --> 07:19.367
I have to see Grammy's plantation
one more time.

07:19.433 --> 07:22.400
Sweetheart, wouldn't it be better
to just let go?

07:22.467 --> 07:23.767
But I can't.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.500
It was hard enough letting go
when Grammy died.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.900
Grandview got turned
into a bed and breakfast,

07:29.967 --> 07:31.100
but at least I could visit.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.333
And have breakfast.

07:33.500 --> 07:34.867
Thank you, Sophia.

07:35.867 --> 07:37.400
Pancakes, by the looks of it.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.600
Thank you, Sophia.

07:42.133 --> 07:46.633
Honey, we'd go with you if it would help,
but by tomorrow, Grandview will be gone.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.600
We'd have to drive all night
and stop at a motel.

07:49.667 --> 07:51.867
We know how you hate to drive.

07:51.934 --> 07:53.667
I found a way around that.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.367
Hey, Blanche,
I figured out this treasure map.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.734
It's buried somewhere outside Atlanta.

07:59.367 --> 08:00.300
Let's roll.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.000
(Rose) Let's try it now with Dorothy.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.166
<i>♪ Dorothy, Dorothy, bo-borthy ♪</i>

08:08.233 --> 08:10.000

08:10.066 --> 08:11.700

08:11.767 --> 08:13.300

08:15.367 --> 08:16.533
(Dorothy) Get out, Rose.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.934
(light music playing)

08:32.533 --> 08:34.667
This is it, Grandview.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.700
Wow!
I've never been to the deep south before.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.000
Well, let's go back.

08:41.066 --> 08:45.066
Ma, I still cannot believe
what you were doing on the interstate.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.600
I was living for the day.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.767
You were mooning a chain gang!

08:52.066 --> 08:54.233
And did you see the smiles on their faces?

08:55.266 --> 08:57.600
They probably hadn't seen a woman
in years.

08:58.133 --> 08:59.300
I guess not.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.400
They kept up with us
through four warning shots.

09:04.767 --> 09:09.300
Oh, Blanche,
you must have so many memories here.

09:09.367 --> 09:10.700
Oh, are you kidding?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.633
I cannot tell you
how many Christmases I spent here.

09:14.266 --> 09:17.166
Grammy's butler would bring us
our eggnog by the hearth,

09:17.233 --> 09:19.100
and Grammy and I would sing carols,

09:19.166 --> 09:22.066
and put out gingerbread men for St. Nick.

09:22.567 --> 09:24.200
Oh, and over there would be grandpappy

09:24.266 --> 09:26.166
drinking out of his jug
with the X's on it,

09:26.233 --> 09:27.600
and wearing his Santa's beard

09:27.667 --> 09:31.166
and just screaming at the lawn jockey
to do him a little dance.

09:33.266 --> 09:34.700
Rose, hold me.

09:34.767 --> 09:35.633
Oh.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.667
Can I help you, folks?

09:38.233 --> 09:39.867
Uh, excuse me.

09:39.934 --> 09:42.600
You don't really know me.
My name's Blanche Devereaux.

09:42.667 --> 09:43.767
My family used to live here,

09:43.834 --> 09:47.734
and I'd very much like to see
my old bedroom, room seven.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.266
Please. We came all the way from Miami.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.200
Okay, but be quick about it.

09:52.266 --> 09:54.533
We're blowing this place up in two hours.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.033
I get to push the plunger
'cause it's my birthday.

09:59.567 --> 10:01.200
Well, happy birthday.

10:04.233 --> 10:05.033
Thanks.

10:05.100 --> 10:06.100
Come on, girls.

10:08.033 --> 10:11.633
Excuse me, sir, but I died yesterday,

10:11.700 --> 10:14.567
and it occurs to me
I never experienced southern food,

10:14.633 --> 10:16.567
so send a possum to room seven,

10:17.133 --> 10:19.400
and, uh, tell my daughter it's chicken.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.333
And Grammy's wind chimes.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.500
Oh, she loved wind chimes.
Had them in every room.

10:28.567 --> 10:30.500
And my balcony.

10:30.567 --> 10:33.700
Oh, I remember as a girl of 10,
I used to wander out here

10:33.767 --> 10:37.800
and the little boys from all around
would come and serenade me.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.033
<i>♪ I see London, I see France ♪</i>

10:42.500 --> 10:44.567
<i>♪ I see Blanche's underpants ♪</i>

10:47.400 --> 10:48.934
Rose, hold me.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
(whimpers)

10:50.066 --> 10:52.467
-Oh, honey, honey.
-Oh, Blanche, please.

10:52.533 --> 10:56.233
Now, honey, I know it's hard,
but we've been here over an hour.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.800
And you've shown us the balcony,
you've shown us the wind chimes,

10:59.867 --> 11:03.233
you've shown us the seven places
you lost your virginity.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.633
Blanche, please, it's getting late.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.667
Dorothy's right.

11:09.734 --> 11:12.467
You really have had a chance
to say goodbye.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.467
I can't say goodbye.

11:14.533 --> 11:15.300
Oh, Blanche.

11:15.367 --> 11:18.867
There's something I haven't told you
about this room,

11:18.934 --> 11:22.066
something I haven't said because
I was afraid you'd think I was weird.

11:23.967 --> 11:24.867
My Grammy...

11:25.700 --> 11:27.133
she's in this room.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.467
Hey, man, cool.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.900
Blanche, come on.
You only think she's here.

11:34.967 --> 11:39.100
You and Grammy spent a lot of time here.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.667
Of course, you can almost feel her here.
Right, Rose?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.834
Well, she's not under the bed.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.467
Dorothy, I know it sounds odd,

11:50.533 --> 11:54.867
but this is the room where Grammy and I
used to have all our heart-to-hearts.

11:54.934 --> 11:57.667
I would snuggle up
in one of her homemade afghans,

11:57.734 --> 12:01.467
and whatever problems I had in life,
she would make right.

12:02.533 --> 12:06.166
And then, after she died,
she started coming to me here,

12:06.233 --> 12:07.800
and the talks didn't stop.

12:08.266 --> 12:10.233
And she's not in the closet.

12:10.934 --> 12:13.066
Okay, folks. That's it.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.600
Get out or get blown up.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.567
All my life she's been helping me.

12:16.633 --> 12:17.867
All my life!

12:17.934 --> 12:20.000
I don't know what I'd do without her.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.266
What are you doing?

12:21.333 --> 12:24.667
If they're going to blow this place up,
they'll do it with me in it.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.333
(somber music playing)

12:32.867 --> 12:34.900
This is ridiculous.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.567
You can't stay here all night.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.100
You'll have to eat sometime.

12:38.166 --> 12:42.700
This is where you don't know me.
I can go for days without food.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.100
Oh, come on, Blanche.

12:44.166 --> 12:47.233
You've been known to debone a chicken
from across the room.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.700
You know, Blanche, when my father died,

12:55.066 --> 12:56.867
I heard his voice, too,

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
or what I thought was his voice.

12:59.266 --> 13:02.533
Honey, it happens to everybody.
It's wishful thinking.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.433
We want to hear them, so we do.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.533
You don't believe that Grammy's here,
that she talks to me.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.467
Of course, I do, sweetheart.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.867
Blanche, this is your Grammy.

13:17.266 --> 13:20.900
Y'all get yourself out of here,
you dumb peckerwood.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.767
Oh, I heard it that time, too.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.734
Feets, don't fail me now.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.467
How dare you mock my Grammy.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.467
Oh, Blanche, you've lost the battle,

13:42.533 --> 13:45.567
but at least you can come here
and visit the grounds.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.400
It won't be the same.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.633
They're going to build a cheap motel here.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.000
You'll be back.

13:54.266 --> 13:58.433
And you can look at these magnificent
magnolias

13:58.500 --> 14:01.734
and stroll that beautiful hillside and...

14:01.800 --> 14:04.633
Ma, what the hell are you doing
on the roof?

14:05.533 --> 14:07.233
(Sophia) Living for the day, pussycat.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
I never jumped into a haystack before.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.233
Ma!

14:11.300 --> 14:12.700
(Sophia) Geronimo!

14:12.767 --> 14:13.934
(tree rustles)

14:20.834 --> 14:21.967
My God!

14:22.467 --> 14:23.800
Dorothy, is she okay?

14:23.867 --> 14:26.066
Yeah, I think so. Rose broke her fall.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.600
Rose, are you okay?

14:30.667 --> 14:31.900
(Rose) Charlie?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.800
Charlie, is that you?

14:36.066 --> 14:38.233
Great. Another one who hears voices.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.500
That's it. I've had it.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.133
My mother is impossible.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.633
You are impossible.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.633
You can rot here, for all I care.

14:44.700 --> 14:46.533
I wish you'd give me
the benefit of the doubt.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.734
Why can't you give me
the benefit of logic?

14:49.233 --> 14:53.166
I'm not saying you're crazy,
but places, smells, sounds,

14:53.233 --> 14:56.567
they're all very powerful suggestions.

14:56.633 --> 15:00.200
I mean, isn't it possible
this is all your imagination, Blanche?

15:00.266 --> 15:01.233
(chimes tinkle)

15:01.300 --> 15:02.233
Blanche?

15:03.266 --> 15:04.000
Fine.

15:04.467 --> 15:06.900
How long do you think
you can stay handcuffed?

15:06.967 --> 15:09.300
My personal best is 32 hours...

15:17.467 --> 15:19.567
But, of course,
then I had somebody to play with.

15:26.066 --> 15:29.233
Blanche, I want to be here
when the dynamite goes off.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.867
I want to ride the rocket with you.

15:32.066 --> 15:35.166
Sophia, I just wonder
if maybe Dorothy's right.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.900
Could this whole granny thing

15:36.967 --> 15:38.934
be something I just talked myself
into believing,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.333
some kind of childhood nonsense?

15:41.400 --> 15:43.567
Dorothy doesn't understand
about these things.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.467
You know, her father sent her
a very special message.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.600
She doesn't want me to tell her.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.467
You can tell me about it, Sophia.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.400
-Really?
-I'd love to hear it.

15:53.467 --> 15:54.300
Picture it.

15:55.100 --> 15:55.767
Heaven.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.133
Two days ago.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.900
I'm holding onto Sal,
telling him I'll never let go,

16:02.367 --> 16:03.800
when who shows up?

16:03.867 --> 16:05.567
(thunder roars)

16:06.233 --> 16:07.100
Uh-oh.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.667
What is it? What's going on?

16:08.734 --> 16:11.066
You're not going to believe this, Sophia,
but, uh...

16:11.567 --> 16:13.200
God, Sophia.

16:13.567 --> 16:15.033
Sophia, God.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.033
Wow! Now I see where Jesus got those eyes.

16:19.767 --> 16:21.266
(thunder roars)

16:21.333 --> 16:23.100
Shh. He's talking.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
Y... yes, I understand, God.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.734
I know these things happen.

16:28.300 --> 16:28.967
What?

16:29.800 --> 16:30.967
Well, if you want.

16:31.633 --> 16:33.333
You dirty rat.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.734
(thunder roars)

16:37.800 --> 16:39.800
You look so sad. What's wrong?

16:39.867 --> 16:41.767
God says it's not your time yet.

16:42.367 --> 16:43.767
You got to go back, Sophia.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.000
But I don't want to go back.

16:46.066 --> 16:48.600
He pretty much gets his way on this.

16:49.066 --> 16:52.166
Besides, someone's got to take care
of little spumoni-face.

16:52.700 --> 16:54.400
-Who?
-Dorothy.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.867
When I worked late, I'd come home,

16:57.400 --> 17:00.133
we had our little secret ice cream club.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.667
That was the nickname I gave her.

17:01.734 --> 17:03.367
What was her nickname for you?

17:03.433 --> 17:04.667
Favorite parent.

17:07.133 --> 17:10.066
(thunder roars)

17:10.133 --> 17:11.367
It's time, Sophia.

17:11.433 --> 17:12.700
Do I have to?

17:12.767 --> 17:14.266
Don't be so sad.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.867
We'll be together again.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.767
I love you, Sal.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.300
And I love you.

17:19.367 --> 17:21.600
And tell my little spumoni-face something,

17:22.233 --> 17:23.300
I'm proud of her.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.700
(magical harp)

17:25.767 --> 17:28.433
(light music playing)

17:28.500 --> 17:30.033
You're right, Blanche.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.300
These naked southern guys sure can dance.

17:37.767 --> 17:39.700
I don't think she's coming down, Rose.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.467
You know, I have a good mind
to just strand her here.

17:42.533 --> 17:43.800
Can you believe that woman?

17:44.500 --> 17:46.333
Hey, Dorothy, have you seen this yet?

17:48.233 --> 17:49.433
BH?

17:50.266 --> 17:51.767
BH.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.367
Blanche Hollingsworth.

17:55.133 --> 17:59.166
Blanche must have written this
when she was a little girl.

18:00.033 --> 18:01.400
(laughs)

18:01.467 --> 18:04.166
Can you imagine Blanche as a little girl?

18:04.233 --> 18:08.734
Running and skipping
all through this house so carefree.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.266
I can almost hear her laughing.

18:12.700 --> 18:17.333
You know, I...
I can almost feel her spirit here.

18:18.166 --> 18:22.333
And if I can feel her spirit here,
then why is it so ridiculous

18:22.400 --> 18:27.033
that Blanche feels the spirit
of her grandma upstairs?

18:27.700 --> 18:33.300
And is it such a leap of faith to believe
that Ma was in the white light?

18:34.400 --> 18:39.800
Why am I making it such a crusade
not to believe either one of them?

18:40.433 --> 18:44.667
What, am I just an ostrich
with its head in the ground?

18:45.300 --> 18:50.900
A narrow-minded ostrich who...
who only believes what she can see

18:51.433 --> 18:53.367
and feel and touch?

18:55.700 --> 18:56.767
Oh, Rose.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.800
Simple Rose.

19:00.033 --> 19:03.367
Rose, you are so wise.

19:05.066 --> 19:07.600
Actually,
I spoke with the demolitions guy.

19:08.133 --> 19:10.467
BH stands for "blast here."

19:16.367 --> 19:17.900
Okay, boys, upstairs we go.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.834
What do you think you're doing?

19:19.900 --> 19:23.633
I'm a patient man,
but your friend is trespassing.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.000
-Let's go.
-Hold it!

19:25.433 --> 19:29.567
I'm not going to let you do this.
Blanche is in a very fragile state.

19:29.633 --> 19:32.433
You can't treat her
like a common criminal.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.767
Dorothy, it's all right.
I'm... I'm coming down.

19:35.834 --> 19:37.900
Blanche, you're out.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.967
Blanche, what happened?
What changed your mind?

19:40.667 --> 19:41.934
Grammy came.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.300
She told me it was time.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.166
Are you okay, honey?

19:45.633 --> 19:47.700
Oh, yeah. We had a wonderful visit.

19:47.767 --> 19:51.333
Excuse me, sir,
but do you mind if I take a souvenir?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.333
Go ahead.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.533
You got a lot of sweet memories here.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.400
I had a Grammy once myself.

19:57.133 --> 20:00.133
Okay, boys,
let's go celebrate my birthday.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.834
Blanche, you need a minute to say goodbye?

20:04.900 --> 20:05.734
Thanks.

20:19.667 --> 20:22.834
(little girl laughing)

20:22.900 --> 20:24.033
(laughs)

20:28.500 --> 20:31.500
(sad music playing)

20:39.433 --> 20:40.567
<i>♪ Beer on the wall ♪</i>

20:40.633 --> 20:42.633
<i>♪ Three bottles of beer on the wall ♪</i>

20:42.700 --> 20:44.400
<i>♪ Three bottles of beer ♪</i>

20:44.467 --> 20:46.367
<i>♪ Take one down, pass it around ♪</i>

20:46.433 --> 20:48.433
<i>♪ Two bottles of beer on the wall... ♪</i>

20:48.900 --> 20:50.100
I'm off to bed.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.700
Rose, you get all the way
to two bottles of beer, and you quit?

20:55.133 --> 20:57.233
Just drives you nuts, doesn't it, Dorothy?

21:01.467 --> 21:03.667
Oh, what a wonderful ride home.

21:03.734 --> 21:06.500
I bet there must have been
a million stars up in the sky,

21:06.567 --> 21:10.100
and I got to spend it all with my friends.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.166
Well, good night.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.133
Whatever happened up in that room
sure did her a world of good.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.266
Excuse me?

21:19.333 --> 21:21.667
I've never seen her like this.

21:21.734 --> 21:24.200
She must have had
a really great experience.

21:24.266 --> 21:27.600
Blanche has a great experience,
but your mother is a nut.

21:27.667 --> 21:29.300
Ma, I never said that.

21:29.367 --> 21:31.367
Why won't you talk to me
about the white light?

21:32.367 --> 21:34.000
It scares me, all right?

21:34.900 --> 21:37.367
It makes me feel like
you're embracing death,

21:37.433 --> 21:38.767
and I don't want to see that.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.700
I want you to rail against it, Ma.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.867
I said I wasn't scared of dying,
not that I'm ready to die.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.600
You don't have to believe all of this,

21:47.667 --> 21:49.633
but stop trying to take it away from me.

21:50.633 --> 21:51.700
I'm going to bed.

21:52.533 --> 21:54.200
Good night, spumoni-face.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.233
What did you call me?

21:57.700 --> 21:58.967
Spumoni-face.

21:59.433 --> 22:03.934
Wow. I mean, I... I haven't heard that
since I was 7 years old.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.633
Oh, Ma, come on. This is crazy.

22:08.700 --> 22:13.000
I probably told you sometime
and just forgot.

22:13.467 --> 22:15.567
He says he's proud of you, Dorothy.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.467
Ma, I just don't understand all this.

22:20.533 --> 22:23.667
I mean, maybe there is a whole lot
I don't know,

22:24.400 --> 22:28.800
supernatural things, hard-to-believe,
strange things that...

22:29.734 --> 22:31.066
that do happen.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.533
Probably more than any of us knows.

22:36.233 --> 22:38.667
Let's throw a sheet over our heads
and scare Rose.

22:38.734 --> 22:39.400
Right.

22:45.100 --> 22:46.633
(chimes tinkling)

22:49.967 --> 22:51.133
Good night, Grammy.

22:53.233 --> 22:54.333
(sighs)

22:57.900 --> 23:02.633
(dreamy music playing)

23:10.400 --> 23:11.967
It's time to sleep, honey.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.367
(tinkling)

23:14.433 --> 23:17.633
Some of us are still alive
and need our beauty sleep.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.433
Be quiet, Grammy.

23:24.433 --> 23:25.467
(sighs)

23:27.734 --> 23:31.367
(tinkling resumes)

23:31.433 --> 23:32.500
"Peckerwood"?

23:33.500 --> 23:34.166
Ah!

23:36.667 --> 23:39.467
(tinkling)
