WEBVTT

00:14.472 --> 00:17.392
[siren blaring in distance]

00:18.018 --> 00:19.644
[man over megaphone] Mr. Miller?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.690
Is everyone okay in there?

00:23.773 --> 00:24.858
[car door opens]

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
Agent Ford, FBI.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.239
Here, sir.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.908
[man over megaphone]
We want to know what's going on.

00:34.701 --> 00:37.871
If you harm anyone,
it will not end well for you!

00:37.954 --> 00:39.456
Special Agent Holden Ford.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.876
-Ninkovich.
-Is he talking?

00:42.959 --> 00:44.294
Not making sense. Been briefed?

00:44.377 --> 00:46.254
On the way over.
Five people still in there?

00:46.337 --> 00:49.090
A security guard, the secretary,
three guys from the line.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.425
[door opens]

00:52.010 --> 00:54.971
-[Miller] Where is she?
-[Ninkovich] Take it easy, Mr. Miller.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.723
[Miller] I want my wife!

00:56.806 --> 00:59.476
Put the gun down,
step away from Ms. Curtwell.

00:59.559 --> 01:04.022
-[Miller] I have asked you--
-We need to see that everyone is unharmed.

01:04.606 --> 01:05.482
You gonna shoot me?

01:05.982 --> 01:09.694
If you do not abide by our terms,
and soon--

01:09.778 --> 01:11.279
You can't see me!

01:11.362 --> 01:14.574
I'm warning you,
our patience is wearing thin.

01:14.657 --> 01:17.660
How can you shoot what you can't see?

01:17.744 --> 01:18.745
Mr. Miller!

01:19.329 --> 01:20.914
-No, thank you.
-[feedback squeals]

01:20.997 --> 01:22.332
Hey, Cody.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.503
My name is Holden. I'd like to help you.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.672
-Tell me what's going on.
-I gotta talk to my wife.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.424
-[Holden] All right.
-She's the only one.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.759
I understand.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.553
For the moment,
is there anything else we can get you?

01:35.637 --> 01:37.639
Get these fucking people away.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.640
Okay.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.229
-Okay...
-[camera shutters clicking]

01:45.313 --> 01:46.815
[sighs]

01:46.898 --> 01:48.942
If I can get them to back off,

01:49.484 --> 01:52.779
will you... relax with Ms. Curtwell?

01:53.696 --> 01:56.324
Give us some time to reach your wife.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.328
[Miller] Okay.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.454
Thank you.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.503
Keep the snipers. Back out the perimeter.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.505
If he starts firing,
we'll have to storm the place.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.674
They're making me nervous.
Imagine what they're doing to him.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.218
He has no criminal history.
He's clearly having an episode.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.637
We need to keep him calm
and wear him down.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.556
Get rid of those reporters.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.767
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:22.851 --> 02:24.561
All right, guys. Back it up!

02:24.644 --> 02:27.689
-[man] All right. Let's go. Back it up.
-[man 2] Move back.

02:29.858 --> 02:30.859
How am I doing?

02:32.443 --> 02:33.945
[woman gasps]

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
-[Miller] You see me?
-Oh, God.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.871
Yes, I can see you!

02:44.330 --> 02:47.292
-What do you see?
-[Holden] I can see that you're naked.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.460
I can see that you're cold.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.630
[thunder rumbling]

02:57.510 --> 02:59.345
[indistinct radio chatter]

02:59.429 --> 03:01.264
Is there a phone?
Can we get him on the line?

03:01.347 --> 03:04.309
-He's got it off the hook.
-That was his demand, talk to his wife?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.352
Took all day to find her.
She's on her way.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.688
-You're not bringing her.
-I want her to calm him.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.440
Her presence might have
the opposite effect.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.321
Hi, Mrs. Miller? Don't get out.

03:16.404 --> 03:19.866
I'm Holden Ford from the FBI.
Do you understand the situation?

03:19.949 --> 03:23.369
-Cody's got some people in there?
-What happened this morning?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.412
I don't know.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.999
I tried to get him sectioned on Sunday,
but I haven't seen him since.

03:28.082 --> 03:31.377
They told me he stole a shotgun,
robbed a liquor store?

03:31.461 --> 03:32.754
Was he delusional? Violent?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.756
He's not violent.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.884
He's been saying that he's invisible
for a while now.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.011
Truly invisible.
He's been seeing a doctor.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.262
Did the doctor diagnose him?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.556
Cody wouldn't tell me.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.100
He's taking medication,
but he might've stopped.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.478
-What kind of medication?
-I'm not sure.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.438
Here's his doctor.

03:50.521 --> 03:52.273
You tried to get him sectioned?

03:52.357 --> 03:55.526
He kept talking to people that weren't
there, saying they could see him.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.030
I told him I was gonna leave him
if he didn't go to the hospital.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.574
-You gave him an ultimatum?
-[Mrs. Miller sobbing] I'm sorry.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.827
-I feel awful.
-This is not your fault.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.704
Has he hurt anyone?

04:06.788 --> 04:09.374
Not that we know about.
I'm sending you along for now.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.292
[bangs on roof of car]

04:14.212 --> 04:15.755
Have someone call his doctor.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.799
Get his wife to tell him
she won't leave him.

04:17.882 --> 04:20.969
We need more information.
Let's see if we can get him on the line.

04:22.845 --> 04:24.097
Cody!

04:24.180 --> 04:26.182
Everything okay in there?

04:29.143 --> 04:31.104
I'd really like to know
what's going on in there.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.064
I promise you, we can work this out.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.031
Where's my wife?

04:42.532 --> 04:46.244
[Holden] It's a difficult situation.
Taking a while to get her here.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.538
-She doesn't want to talk to me?
-[Holden] That's not it.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.249
She is very worried about you.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.210
-You talked to her?
-[Holden] On the phone.

04:55.253 --> 04:58.214
-Maybe you could talk to her on the phone.
-No!

05:00.049 --> 05:01.634
She has to be here.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.226
-[Holden] I understand your frustration.
-[Miller] What do you understand?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.980
[Holden] Not being able to communicate
with a trusted loved one.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.774
What do you want to say to her?

05:17.775 --> 05:18.985
Why would I tell you?

05:22.238 --> 05:23.740
Maybe I can help.

05:25.658 --> 05:26.743
I don't think so.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.875
[screams]

05:33.958 --> 05:36.627
[all clamoring]

05:46.179 --> 05:48.806
[theme music playing]

07:26.112 --> 07:27.321
[door opens]

08:27.673 --> 08:28.508
[exhales]

09:28.317 --> 09:29.819
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

09:40.830 --> 09:45.751
You followed procedure. You did your job.
You did everything by the book.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.588
He took hostages.
He knew there'd be consequences.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.673
-He thought he was invisible.
-You're not his shrink.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.926
You're not responsible for diagnosing him.
That's not your remit.

09:54.885 --> 09:58.055
These things happen in real time,
and we are the last responders.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.684
If an operation's gonna go south,
this is not the worst outcome.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.436
Stay focused on what we do.

10:03.519 --> 10:06.397
If I did everything by the book,
it begs the question--

10:06.480 --> 10:10.484
This place is pretty much the benchmark
for excellence in law enforcement.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.572
In the rest of the world,
hostage negotiation's on its way out.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.617
You think the Israelis bothered
to negotiate at Entebbe last year?

10:19.869 --> 10:24.457
You didn't lose one hostage or bystander.
That's how we measure success.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.086
And your courses are a big hit
in the summer.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.255
I actually think
you should be teaching more.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.466
-You're putting me out to pasture.
-No.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.551
I'm putting you to work
where it really counts.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.011
Despite what happened.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.347
Because  of what happened, Holden.

10:39.847 --> 10:40.890
It seasoned you.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.103
Thank you, sir...

10:47.104 --> 10:48.105
but I'd rather not.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.774
Well, this is awkward.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.695
I'd like you to sleep on it
over the weekend...

10:56.322 --> 10:58.491
because you start full-time on Monday.

11:06.791 --> 11:11.003
This is how we find ourselves
completely out of control.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.716
The fugitive has already killed
a police officer that morning in Austin.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.553
He's taken two nine-millimeter rounds
in the ass,

11:19.637 --> 11:21.472
grabbed a ten-year-old boy as a hostage,

11:21.555 --> 11:23.391
and he's holed up
in a suburban neighborhood

11:23.474 --> 11:25.601
crawling with women and small children.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.687
Now we must focus on one thing:

11:29.355 --> 11:31.065
de-escalation.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.319
San Antonio's chief of police arrives
and starts using a bullhorn,

11:35.403 --> 11:38.739
which more than effectively
intimidates our hostage-taker.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.244
Coming at anyone with an attitude of
"I'm right, you're wrong"

11:43.327 --> 11:45.454
assumes that they're of rational mind.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.376
We must establish communication.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.880
Non-threatening communication.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.049
Ascertain demands,

11:57.133 --> 12:00.261
concede nothing, reject nothing,
just listen.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.389
Listen to what he has to say.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.227
Try understanding him
instead of trying to dominate him.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.729
Look for common ground.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.815
Find commonality.

12:13.357 --> 12:17.153
And if it feels like you're buying time,
well... that's because you are.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.739
But it's the key
to making any perp feel heard.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.284
-[chime sounds]
-[indistinct chatter]

12:23.367 --> 12:24.869
[Holden] Our goal is no body bags.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.329
That is the hostage negotiator win-win.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.876
And I'm in my office on Friday
for anyone who has questions

12:31.959 --> 12:34.253
about the psychological strategies exam.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.806
[man] Wanton, indiscriminate murder.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.517
Seemingly random, serendipitous.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.269
Each one, extremely violent.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.980
No explanation. No apparent reason.

12:53.063 --> 12:54.607
They weren't sexually assaulted,

12:54.690 --> 12:56.650
there was no attempt
to relieve them of valuables,

12:56.734 --> 12:58.360
they didn't know their assailant.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.198
Robert Violante and Stacy Moskowitz
were making out in their car

13:02.281 --> 13:05.493
when David Berkowitz walked up
and shot them both point-blank.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.704
Berkowitz killed six people
over two summers,

13:08.787 --> 13:10.748
wounding seven more. Why?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.376
Because a dog told him to do it.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.670
Now...

13:18.506 --> 13:22.259
we can say that the guy's crazy,
or that he's pretending that he's crazy.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.346
But if we're looking for a motive
we can understand,

13:25.429 --> 13:27.306
we suddenly find there is none.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.099
It's a void.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.518
It's a black hole.

13:36.232 --> 13:40.986
Forty years ago, your FBI was founded
hunting down John Dillinger,

13:41.445 --> 13:43.989
Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.742
Criminals who thumbed their noses
at society,

13:46.825 --> 13:49.078
but were basically in it
for personal gain.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.999
Now, we have extreme violence
between strangers.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.502
Where do we go...

13:57.670 --> 14:00.005
when motive becomes elusive?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.600
Excuse me, Professor Rathman?

14:13.852 --> 14:16.272
Holden Ford, Hostage Negotiation.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.565
Peter. Hi.

14:17.648 --> 14:21.277
I listened in on your class earlier.
What you were saying about crime today...

14:22.152 --> 14:23.863
I don't know, it really resonates.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.031
-Gets attention.
-Were you teaching this before Berkowitz?

14:26.115 --> 14:28.701
A version of it.
The headlines kind of fell into my lap.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.869
What got you started?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.621
Starkweather. Whitman.
Manson, of course.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.249
But Son of Sam kind of epitomizes now.

14:35.332 --> 14:39.420
It's as if... we don't know anymore
what moves people to kill one another.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.256
Used to be you find a victim
with 50 stab wounds,

14:42.339 --> 14:45.092
you look for the jilted lover,
the ex-business partner.

14:45.342 --> 14:49.138
Now... it could be a random run-in
with a disgruntled mailman.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.558
It's a different era.
No more "Just the facts, ma'am."

14:52.641 --> 14:54.810
That's television. And reruns.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.479
-Crime has changed.
-Right.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.733
Do you... want to grab a beer?

15:02.192 --> 15:03.193
Yeah, okay.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.071
[Rathman] Look at the unprecedented events

15:06.155 --> 15:08.866
that have occurred
in the past decade and a half.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.492
A president assassinated.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.245
Fighting an unpopular war
that we didn't win.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.748
National Guard killing
four college students.

15:15.831 --> 15:18.292
-You can hardly wrap your mind around it.
-Watergate.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.921
Our democracy is vanishing into what?

15:22.004 --> 15:23.672
Is that what all this is about?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
Just a response to turmoil?

15:26.008 --> 15:29.094
The government used to be, symbolically,
a parental institution.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.639
Now? It's a free-for-all.

15:31.722 --> 15:35.184
The world barely makes any sense,
so it follows that crime doesn't either.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.729
You and I could theorize all night,
but the truth is, I don't fucking know.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.023
-I don't know either.
-No one does.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.691
But we're supposed to, right?

15:42.775 --> 15:47.237
Sure, but here's the troubling thing:
no one's even asking the questions.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.034
We are.

15:52.701 --> 15:53.702
We are.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.915
Mm!

15:59.333 --> 16:02.586
Next time, let's discuss
Lee Harvey Oswald as Oedipus.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.589
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.395
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.063
What are you looking at?

16:21.814 --> 16:22.940
I like your outfit.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.901
What is that, a jumpsuit?
What do you call that?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.112
-This? I call it a jumpsuit.
-Stylish.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.698
What do you call that?
You look like a Mormon.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.282
You look like my dad.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.409
Is he a Mormon?

16:33.492 --> 16:34.910
No, but he looks like one.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.203
So does mine.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.622
He bought me this suit,
as a matter of fact.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.041
Did he buy you those nice shiny shoes?

16:41.458 --> 16:42.334
Yes.

16:42.918 --> 16:45.421
I have one brown pair and one black pair.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.590
I've got sneakers,
but I had to buy those myself.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.844
What kind of grown-up lets their parents
choose their clothes for them?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.682
-Are you coming on to me?
-How do you like my approach?

17:02.354 --> 17:03.981
You having a good time?

17:04.064 --> 17:05.733
-I will be.
-Huh!

17:05.816 --> 17:07.026
It's my birthday today.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.361
Happy birthday. How old are you?

17:09.445 --> 17:12.197
-Twenty-four.
-You don't look old enough to be in here.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.533
-What are you, a narc?
-FBI, actually.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.786
Special Agent Holden Ford.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.204
Wow.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.042
-Can you tell?
-Everybody can tell.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.501
You got a gun?

17:24.585 --> 17:26.795
I have one,
but I'm not gonna show it to you.

17:26.879 --> 17:27.796
Nuts.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.175
I'm a teacher.
Right up the road at Quantico.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.384
What do you teach?

17:33.260 --> 17:36.263
Hostage negotiation, such as it is.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.183
-Holy cow.
-You really think I look like a narc?

17:39.266 --> 17:41.435
-Are you kidding?
-I don't see it.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.228
You stick out like a sore thumb.

17:44.646 --> 17:48.400
Well, I'm not here to...
infiltrate the Black Panthers.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.404
Those guys are hardly Black Panthers.
They're engineering students.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.323
You should go talk to them.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.367
I'm sure the FBI's in need
of some great-looking black dudes.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.621
-You've got the wrong idea about me.
-You gonna book me?

18:00.704 --> 18:01.872
Maybe.

18:01.955 --> 18:02.998
Handcuffs?

18:08.170 --> 18:10.506
I'm here to see this really cool band
from Detroit.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.424
You ever been to Detroit?

18:13.217 --> 18:14.760
Yes, actually. I was a--

18:18.430 --> 18:20.891
I was a brick agent there
for a couple of years.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.645
I can't believe they're here.
They used to play PJ's in Corktown.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.814
-You know Corktown?
-Sure.

18:26.897 --> 18:29.358
-It looked like a furniture store.
-They always sold liquor.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.820
The whole furniture thing was just a front
that started during Prohibition.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.321
Where are you really from?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.532
[sighs] Everywhere.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.283
But the Midwest, right?

18:38.367 --> 18:41.328
I grew up in the Midwest,
but I was born in Brooklyn.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.789
You do not seem like a guy from New York.

18:44.873 --> 18:47.042
You don't seem like a girl from Corktown.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.380
Buy you a drink?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.511
-[rock music playing]
-[vocalizing]

20:56.463 --> 20:59.007
[music continues]

21:36.837 --> 21:39.047
-[Holden] What's your name?
-Debbie.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.803
-You want some pot?
-Is that a trick question?

21:44.886 --> 21:45.887
Come on.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.390
Are you serious?
No, that's completely inappropriate.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.225
Come on, it's my birthday.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.811
Oh, Jesus, you're not gonna
drink and drive, are you?

21:52.894 --> 21:54.354
You've been plying me with booze.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.732
Don't you think
that's kind of a mixed message?

22:01.069 --> 22:01.987
You coming?

22:06.033 --> 22:07.909
[engine starts]

22:12.080 --> 22:15.334
[indistinct chatter]

22:15.417 --> 22:17.544
[rock music plays softly]

22:20.005 --> 22:23.383
So what does a brick agent
get up to in Detroit?

22:23.884 --> 22:25.761
Mostly corralling Army deserters.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.097
Guys AWOL from Vietnam
trying to get to Canada.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.600
Too scared to go back.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.603
Young guys. Same age I was.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.688
So you were a snitch?

22:38.940 --> 22:40.942
There's worse things than being a snitch.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.615
Maybe this'll loosen you up.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.743
[Holden exhales]

22:50.243 --> 22:51.870
God, you are making me nervous.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.289
You are such a goody-goody.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.709
What are you, some kind of honey trap?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.253
I've been warned to watch out
for women like you.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.215
You mean normal ones?

23:08.595 --> 23:10.305
[sighs]

23:10.889 --> 23:13.475
So just put your mouth over the hole...

23:16.311 --> 23:17.938
[exhales] Okay. [clears throat]

23:21.942 --> 23:23.401
-And inhale.
-[bubbling]

23:29.533 --> 23:30.617
[coughs]

23:30.700 --> 23:32.119
[coughing loudly]

23:33.995 --> 23:35.288
[continues coughing]

23:35.372 --> 23:38.125
[gunfire]

23:41.753 --> 23:43.171
[panting]

23:44.756 --> 23:47.092
[loud gunfire]

23:47.175 --> 23:49.136
[man]  I don't want to talk
to somebody trying to calm me.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.971
-Get somebody in charge.
-I am in charge!

23:51.054 --> 23:54.850
I don't want to talk to some flunky pig
trying to calm me. What's he doing?

23:54.933 --> 23:57.060
-Will you get back over there?
-What are they there for?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.771
Will you get the fuck back?
Get back there, will ya?

23:59.855 --> 24:01.189
-Look at him!
-Get over there!

24:01.273 --> 24:03.900
- Go back there, man!
- Get over there, will ya?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.945
He wants to kill me so bad,
he can taste it! All right?

24:07.028 --> 24:09.656
Attica! Attica! Attica!

24:10.699 --> 24:13.869
-Attica! Attica!
-[crowd cheering]

24:13.952 --> 24:16.997
Attica! Attica! Attica!

24:17.080 --> 24:20.709
[man]  I was so confused,
I was doing insane things.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.670
What sort of things, Leon?

24:28.592 --> 24:29.718
After the wedding...

24:31.052 --> 24:33.471
I ran off for ten days to Atlantic City.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.516
Sonny was frantic.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.560
He knew I'd been drinking,

24:38.643 --> 24:40.979
he didn't know where I was,
who I was with.

24:42.564 --> 24:45.317
[stuttering]  Well,
I couldn't explain the things I did.

24:46.234 --> 24:47.861
So I went to a psychiatrist...

24:48.528 --> 24:49.654
who told me...

24:50.780 --> 24:54.242
that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.668
[Holden] So they were both homosexuals,

25:03.752 --> 25:05.003
but he was married,

25:05.086 --> 25:08.798
and his boyfriend wanted to become
a woman, which is confusing.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.301
-You really gotta get out more, Holden.
-It was mixed up.

25:11.384 --> 25:14.012
-You didn't like it?
-No, I really liked it.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.765
It was just so... sad.

25:16.848 --> 25:20.310
He was obviously very disturbed,
but somehow I liked him.

25:20.393 --> 25:22.604
-Yeah, you have empathy.
-Yeah.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.439
Empathy.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.776
I really liked the dialogue.
It was just very real.

25:27.859 --> 25:29.152
When I started at the Academy,

25:29.236 --> 25:32.113
they would send women out of the room
if there was any of that talk.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.449
They called it "deviant terminology."

25:34.532 --> 25:36.785
We even had a list of words
we had to memorize.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.578
Really? Which words?

25:39.955 --> 25:40.997
You know...

25:41.081 --> 25:44.459
fuck, shit, pussy... blow job.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.379
Oh, fuck.

25:48.004 --> 25:48.922
Shit.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.132
[both moaning]

25:51.633 --> 25:53.051
Finger my pussy.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.097
Finger my pussy, I'll give you a blow job.

25:57.597 --> 25:59.766
[Debbie laughs]

26:00.850 --> 26:02.811
All the bad words used in a sentence.

26:07.857 --> 26:10.568
[moaning]

26:11.361 --> 26:13.363
[man]  It's classic he said-she said.

26:13.446 --> 26:17.450
He says she hit her head on the bedpost
having consensual sexual intercourse.

26:17.534 --> 26:18.785
She says he knocked her out

26:18.868 --> 26:21.121
and dragged her into this motel room
to rape her.

26:21.204 --> 26:25.166
We know she didn't hit her head
on that bedpost because we've measured.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.043
[Shepard] Where do you propose
you would go?

26:27.127 --> 26:29.045
University of Virginia in Charlottesville.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.130
Studying what?

26:30.213 --> 26:33.675
Contemporary Applied Criminal Psychology.
Ratchet things up a notch.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.760
What exactly is it
you think you're missing out on?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.679
We need to know
the current academic thinking.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.723
No, you don't want to rely
on academics, Holden.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.225
I'm not saying rely, just get updated.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.643
We just got updated.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.980
It's all in the library.
1972, everything was new.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.773
That was five years ago.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.276
What's the thinking now?

26:51.359 --> 26:52.569
Okay, look.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.072
There have been some fine
psychological studies over the years,

26:56.156 --> 26:59.701
but these are people
who don't understand the criminal mind.

26:59.784 --> 27:03.121
They understand their corner of the world,
which is a very small corner.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.540
Well, they must know something.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.755
I'm going to level with you.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.384
I'm going to tell you something
I really don't want you to repeat.

27:17.093 --> 27:22.182
As far as the Bureau is concerned,
psychology is for backroom boys.

27:22.265 --> 27:25.477
-[chime sounds]
-You understand what I'm trying to say?

27:27.270 --> 27:28.980
No. What's a "backroom boy"?

27:30.774 --> 27:32.317
It's just frowned upon.

27:34.652 --> 27:36.738
We should be using every resource we can.

27:38.323 --> 27:41.826
Talking to the smartest people we find
from the broadest possible spectrum.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.371
-And we do.
-Otherwise, it's like the military.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.956
-Hey, we recruited Elvis.
-So did the military.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.792
The King doesn't do it for you?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.960
Hoover died over five years ago,

27:51.044 --> 27:54.881
and we're still recruiting accountants
and lawyers like it's 1946.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.133
Actually, recruitment has tapered off.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.261
-We can't get accountants.
-Well, then we're in trouble.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.348
[sighs] All right. I'll scratch your back

28:03.431 --> 28:05.642
and recommend funding for you
to audit a few classes,

28:05.725 --> 28:09.020
but you will be expected to use
the opportunity for recruitment.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.898
Speakers, lecturers, great minds.

28:11.981 --> 28:15.527
-Are you sure you want  me  doing that?
-You're smart, you're idealistic...

28:15.735 --> 28:16.903
more than a little sensitive.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.655
They're gonna love you.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.258
[bell tolling]

28:42.804 --> 28:45.306
-Hare Krishna.
-Hare Krishna.

28:46.558 --> 28:49.310
-Hare Krishna.
-[man]  And then, in 1872,

28:49.394 --> 28:54.274
Italian physician Cesare Lombroso
drags us out of the Dark Ages

28:54.357 --> 28:57.068
and launches the scientific era
in criminology

28:57.736 --> 29:01.072
by differentiating five criminal classes:

29:02.991 --> 29:04.284
the born criminal,

29:05.410 --> 29:06.911
insane criminal,

29:07.787 --> 29:09.414
criminal by passion,

29:10.457 --> 29:11.875
habitual criminal,

29:12.250 --> 29:14.919
and the occasional criminal.

29:15.003 --> 29:17.630
In other words,
there are those that are born that way

29:18.131 --> 29:20.425
and those who become that way.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.427
And in 1965,
there's this other breakthrough.

29:22.510 --> 29:24.345
This criminal psychology research project

29:24.429 --> 29:28.266
at Bellevue psychiatric hospital
in New York couched it like this:

29:28.349 --> 29:31.269
personality and character

29:31.352 --> 29:35.690
far outweigh the presence
of psychotic or defective diagnoses.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.526
In other words, by extrapolation...

29:39.360 --> 29:40.820
are criminals born...

29:42.322 --> 29:44.115
or are they formed?

30:04.969 --> 30:06.137
Do you mind if I sit?

30:06.596 --> 30:07.430
You're sitting.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.770
You know, I wasn't aware
of that project at Bellevue.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.688
Well, you should be.

30:16.689 --> 30:19.400
Where I come from,
criminals are always born that way.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.319
Some people
will never stop believing that.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.905
-It's too easy.
-It lets us off the hook.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.865
Well, essentially we're a puritan nation.

30:25.949 --> 30:29.202
We blame all our problems
on a minority of bad apples.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.704
What's your name again?
I'm sorry. Is it Leon?

30:31.788 --> 30:32.747
Buchanan. [scoffs]

30:33.790 --> 30:34.666
Leo.

30:34.749 --> 30:35.583
Holden.

30:36.376 --> 30:38.503
-Holden Ford.
-I know who you are.

30:39.462 --> 30:40.463
Everybody does.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.506
Yeah.

30:42.715 --> 30:44.717
I've noticed some of the looks
I've been getting.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.679
Funny looks isn't a federal offense...
yet.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.848
Yeah, they're just curious.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.474
Well, I'm not a spy.

30:51.891 --> 30:53.226
This isn't some kind of cover.

30:53.309 --> 30:57.105
Good. Because that...
would have been a really pathetic cover.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.234
I'm actually an instructor too,
but I'm just here to learn.

31:04.279 --> 31:05.697
What do you want to talk about?

31:05.780 --> 31:08.157
I want to start a dialogue with you.

31:08.241 --> 31:09.409
Would be that okay?

31:10.201 --> 31:11.578
A dialogue about what?

31:12.120 --> 31:15.874
I'm an instructor in the Bureau's training
and recruitment program out of Quantico.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.793
And we really need to hear
from people like you.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.964
I'm sorry, are you trying to recruit me?

31:23.047 --> 31:25.717
Just to hear your perspectives
and your insights.

31:28.094 --> 31:30.722
[laughs] I understand...

31:32.765 --> 31:33.808
perfectly.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.731
I'm sorry. You call yourself
a professor of criminal psychology.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.276
But you won't even talk
to the educational arm of the FBI?

31:43.359 --> 31:44.319

35:29.794 --> 35:31.796
Excuse me. What is the point of this?

35:31.879 --> 35:33.131
[Holden] Great question.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.800
Psychologically preparing you for reality.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.261
And the reality is,
you have to talk to them.

35:38.344 --> 35:41.013
Somebody demands the impossible,
you can't just shoot him.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.723
Then why have so much firearms training?

35:42.807 --> 35:45.810
Well, because that is a tactical response
for when all else fails.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.020
But if local law enforcement
can't shut something down,

35:48.104 --> 35:50.606
then it has required a tactical response.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.109
Okay, but wouldn't you like
to try something different?

35:53.317 --> 35:55.987
Or would you rather use firearms
all the time?

35:57.572 --> 35:59.991
-I'd kind of rather use firearms.
-Why?

Holden, I enjoyed that immensely.
What do you call that?

36:09.667 --> 36:12.587
It's just role-playing
in a simulated hostage situation.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.213
-Stimulated?
-Simulated.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.591
All that profanity,
is that an academic thing?

36:16.674 --> 36:19.135
They're improvising.
They're learning to create a dialogue.

36:19.218 --> 36:21.220
How is all that cursing
creating a dialogue?

36:21.304 --> 36:22.763
It's not really about the cursing.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.933
I'm sure it's all quite modern
and fashionable in academic circles,

36:26.017 --> 36:28.144
but it seems very theatrical to me.

36:28.227 --> 36:30.104
Well, in criminal psych,
role-playing exercises

36:30.188 --> 36:32.899
are considered a valuable tool,
with or without the cursing.

36:32.982 --> 36:35.693
I think we have enough exercises here
at the Academy.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.112
If you're going to start
implementing new ones,

36:38.196 --> 36:40.156
talk to somebody
in the Behavioral Science Unit.

36:40.239 --> 36:41.073
They can help?

36:41.157 --> 36:44.327
They can go over the soundness
of the psychology. That's their thing.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.786
Okay, good idea.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.955

don't want to go back to school

it undermines their authority.

it would give me some authority.

39:12.975 --> 39:15.436
There's a million cops out there
who want to know what we know.

39:15.936 --> 39:19.023
So I go to them, give them a distillation
of what we teach here,

39:19.106 --> 39:20.691
and they tell me what they've been doing.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.859

39:21.942 --> 39:25.321
and I learn something firsthand
by getting involved on their level.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.354
Do we look like
we're from the Methodist church?

42:45.437 --> 42:46.397
Yes.

42:46.939 --> 42:47.940
Make a hole.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.693
Good to see ya.

42:51.902 --> 42:54.113
[Tench] Motive, means, opportunity.

42:54.196 --> 42:57.575
The three pillars of criminal
investigation for the last century.

42:58.158 --> 43:01.704
But it's 1977,
and suddenly motive is elusive.

43:03.372 --> 43:04.748
What, why, who.

43:05.291 --> 43:08.168
"What happened?"
"Why did it happen that way?"

43:08.252 --> 43:10.087
Which should lead to: "Who did it?"

43:11.130 --> 43:14.258
A person is murdered.
Not sexually assaulted, not robbed.

43:14.633 --> 43:16.677
But the body is mutilated posthumously.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.847
The question is not only
why did the killer do it,

43:19.930 --> 43:22.016
but why did the killer do it this way?

43:23.100 --> 43:27.187
We are now talking about... psychology.

43:30.232 --> 43:33.193
[clears throat] When I'm involved
in a hostage negotiation,

43:33.277 --> 43:35.529
the perpetrator is standing
right in front of me,

43:35.613 --> 43:38.866
but I have to gauge
how much destruction he's capable of,

43:39.366 --> 43:43.621
what in his background or personal life
that could've triggered today's standoff.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.247
Some people are just crazy, right?

43:45.789 --> 43:47.958
Crazy in that they have no reason
for what they do?

43:48.042 --> 43:49.376
-Yeah.
-[Holden] Okay.

43:49.460 --> 43:53.922
But keep in mind, often, this crazy person
has never done anything like this before.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.799
Something just... flips.

43:56.383 --> 43:58.260
-Like a switch.
-Good, a switch.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.220
Anybody know what flips it?

44:01.180 --> 44:03.474
-Getting fired?
-Fired. Yes.

44:03.557 --> 44:04.933
-Getting dumped.
-[Holden] Absolutely.

44:05.017 --> 44:07.227
A romantic breakup is a top trigger.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.523
When we know who the criminal is,
we can understand what set him off.

44:11.607 --> 44:13.817
In a homicide situation,
we do the inverse.

44:14.234 --> 44:18.572
We ask, "What happened?
Why did it happen that way?"

44:18.656 --> 44:20.783
Which narrows the search for who did it.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.578
But what if our killer
is someone who's not rational?

44:31.251 --> 44:33.170
Why do we behave the way we do?

44:34.713 --> 44:38.801
It's a question asked by poets,
and philosophers, and theologians

44:38.884 --> 44:40.511
since time immemorial.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.765
The playground of Shakespeare,
Dostoyevsky, Freud.

44:44.848 --> 44:48.435
The stuff of  Crime and Punishment
and  Beyond the Pleasure Principal.

44:49.687 --> 44:53.941
The greatest minds in history have been
fascinated by the vagaries of behavior.

44:56.485 --> 45:01.490
So, in a case where we can't immediately
divine a motive, we shouldn't panic.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.034
It's a riddle, but it can be solved.

45:04.118 --> 45:07.996
It's complex, but... it's human.

45:10.290 --> 45:12.292
-[quiet muttering]
-Thank you, Holden.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.504
That was very... illuminating.

45:15.587 --> 45:18.549
[quiet laughter, chatter]

45:18.632 --> 45:21.176
So what the hell's
Beyond the Pleasure Principle?

45:21.260 --> 45:24.096
-By Freud?
-[man] So this is about sex?

45:24.179 --> 45:26.765
Actually, it's where he looks
for human impulses beyond sex,

45:26.849 --> 45:28.892
-specifically the death drive.
-[man 2] What's that?

45:28.976 --> 45:31.937
-Something my kid does with a stick shift.
-[laughter]

45:32.020 --> 45:34.481
Freud suggests that there's
an innate desire for destruction,

45:34.565 --> 45:36.859
based on the propensity for matter
to return--

45:36.942 --> 45:38.902
-What does this have to do with motive?
-[Holden] Well...

45:39.319 --> 45:43.323
we've always looked at motive
as need or greed, right?

45:43.407 --> 45:46.285
-Guy steals a TV to sell it to buy drugs.
-[Holden] Exactly.

45:46.368 --> 45:49.371
But let's say, while he's at it,
he steals your wife's panties, too.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.165
If he stole my wife's panties,
I'd be amazed.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.792
-[laughter]
-[Holden] Well, he's not selling those.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.170
So why does he do it?
Is it merely prurient?

45:56.253 --> 45:58.755
He could be motivated by something
he doesn't even understand.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.091
Our new quest, like Freud,

46:01.175 --> 46:04.761
is to look beyond what we assume
are obvious impulses.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.513
So why didn't you just say that?

46:11.226 --> 46:14.396
[Holden]   They don't want to learn.
What are we even doing here?

46:14.646 --> 46:16.523
[Tench] Don't make it too complicated.

46:16.773 --> 46:17.983
What's wrong with complicated?

46:18.066 --> 46:20.944
There's complicated
and there's too complicated, Holden.

46:24.156 --> 46:27.075
We used to do this experiment
in social psychology.

46:27.618 --> 46:28.952
Uh-huh. What was that?

46:29.328 --> 46:32.956
You get onto a crowded elevator,
and you face the opposite direction,

46:33.040 --> 46:36.543
the back of the elevator,
and everybody freaks out.

46:37.044 --> 46:40.380
They're uncomfortable
for reasons they can't even articulate.

46:41.465 --> 46:45.803
But if you turn around and face the front,
everybody relaxes.

46:46.386 --> 46:49.014
Okay. Well, how do we do that?

46:51.934 --> 46:53.310
What do we have in common?

46:55.437 --> 46:56.647
What unites us?

46:58.649 --> 47:01.527
What keeps us all awake at night?

47:05.364 --> 47:09.159
-[all groaning]
-Monster. Right?

47:10.118 --> 47:11.537
I think we can all agree.

47:13.622 --> 47:15.457
But what do you really know about him?

47:16.333 --> 47:19.044
Did you know that his mother
was a jailbird and a prostitute?

47:19.419 --> 47:21.088
Did you know when he was ten years old,

47:21.171 --> 47:24.007
she palmed him off
onto his sadistic, Bible-thumping uncle

47:24.091 --> 47:28.679
who beat him within an inch of his life
and taunted him to act like a man?

47:29.513 --> 47:31.473
Charles responded to that
by becoming a pimp

47:31.557 --> 47:34.268
and an armed robber,
and was incarcerated for over 20 years,

47:34.351 --> 47:36.353
where he continued to be brutalized.

47:36.436 --> 47:41.275
In 1967, he was paroled,
during the Summer of Love.

47:42.067 --> 47:43.443
And our nightmare began.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.322
[all groaning, chattering]

47:50.951 --> 47:52.369
-[man] Jesus!
-[man 2] Come on!

47:54.621 --> 47:58.000
Here we have a child who was unwanted,
unloved, regularly beaten,

47:58.083 --> 47:59.835
and repeatedly institutionalized.

47:59.918 --> 48:03.964
Now, might this not have had
some sort of an effect on him?

48:04.631 --> 48:07.050
-He was born that way.
-What way?

48:07.634 --> 48:10.178
-[man] Just bad.
-Can we be a little bit more specific?

48:10.262 --> 48:12.472
-Technically, he didn't kill anybody.
-[murmuring]

48:12.556 --> 48:15.892
Look at those eyes.
How can you not say that dude's evil?

48:15.976 --> 48:19.646
That's a little bit Old Testament,
don't you think?

48:19.730 --> 48:23.483
Good, evil, black, white, it's easy.

48:23.859 --> 48:26.695
But who in this room
has a life that's easy?

48:27.529 --> 48:30.032
Circumstances affect behavior.

48:30.699 --> 48:32.743
When we look at Manson's background,

48:32.826 --> 48:36.288
the real question is,
how could we not have seen this coming?

48:36.371 --> 48:37.331
We did.

48:37.873 --> 48:39.041
[Holden] I'm sorry?

48:39.124 --> 48:42.586
He was institutionalized
because we could see it coming.

48:42.669 --> 48:45.589
Okay, but I'm saying maybe, just maybe,

48:46.131 --> 48:48.967
locking him up his young life
helped make him what he was.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.761
-[man] No.
-What the fuck?

48:50.844 --> 48:53.221
They locked him up
because of what he did.

48:53.305 --> 48:54.765
They already knew what he was.

48:54.848 --> 48:57.934
Okay, guys, I'm not asking anybody
to feel sorry for Charles Manson.

48:58.018 --> 49:00.771
If he were here, I'd shoot him dead.
No one would stop me.

49:00.854 --> 49:01.688
[man] Right.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.982
What Holden's trying to say
is maybe it's both.

49:04.066 --> 49:06.234
The one impacting on the other
in a vicious circle.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.487
Nobody has all the answers.

49:08.570 --> 49:11.490
-We have some answers.
-We should be asking questions.

49:11.573 --> 49:12.824
[man] No shit.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.327
Well, I'll just tell my buddies
in Robbery-Homicide

49:15.410 --> 49:17.663
who were there
when the corpses were found,

49:17.746 --> 49:20.999
that they may have overlooked
a difficult upbringing.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.459
You were LAPD?

49:22.542 --> 49:23.877
Twenty-two years.

49:25.128 --> 49:26.254
You worked Manson?

49:26.338 --> 49:28.548
No, but I knew every single man who did.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.718
How many homicides have you worked?

49:31.802 --> 49:33.804
[audience murmuring]

49:35.472 --> 49:38.350
Figure out who you're talking to
before you tell a sob story

49:38.433 --> 49:40.185
about little Chuckie Manson.

49:40.268 --> 49:42.521
They wrote "pigs" on the wall
in their victims' blood.

49:42.604 --> 49:44.147
They completely missed my point.

49:44.231 --> 49:47.526
In the future, ask if anyone's worked
a case before you bring it up.

49:47.609 --> 49:50.445
-Know your fucking audience.
-Oh, shit.

49:51.405 --> 49:53.699
It's okay, they always do this.

49:53.782 --> 49:55.534
Just be a good listener.

49:55.617 --> 49:56.535
Gentlemen.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.204
Frank McGraw.

50:00.163 --> 50:02.165
I didn't mean to embarrass anybody
back there.

50:02.249 --> 50:03.375
Not a problem.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.544
We're all a little tense around here.

50:05.627 --> 50:09.297
You must have heard about the mother
and child who were murdered recently.

50:09.381 --> 50:12.175
-Ada Jeffries and her boy.
-We've seen reporters.

50:13.385 --> 50:14.970
She was bound,

50:15.053 --> 50:17.347
stabbed repeatedly
about the chest and face.

50:18.014 --> 50:19.266
The boy's throat was cut.

50:19.349 --> 50:22.352
[groans] Rough one.

50:22.436 --> 50:26.273
I don't understand entirely
what you're talking about with psychology.

50:27.649 --> 50:30.068
I don't understand
much of anything anymore.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.737
What's on your mind, Frank?

50:34.030 --> 50:36.616
-I hate to bother.
-No, by all means. Bother us.

50:43.081 --> 50:46.960
When I left Los Angeles,
I thought I'd gone far enough.

50:49.755 --> 50:53.258
Ada was the kind of woman
who wouldn't say boo to a goose.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.553
She came from a deeply religious family
in Arkansas.

50:57.095 --> 50:59.890
When they found out she was pregnant,
they put her out.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.934
She lived in a rooming house
in Libertyville.

51:03.018 --> 51:07.564
No drugs, no alcohol,
never had a brush with the law.

51:08.315 --> 51:10.484
The boy was polite and quiet.

51:11.151 --> 51:13.904
She had him in Sunday school
at the Methodist church.

51:14.237 --> 51:17.407
She would sweep the steps every evening,

51:18.325 --> 51:19.743
just to be of service.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.829
I never met Ada.

51:23.747 --> 51:24.623
Every now and again,

51:24.706 --> 51:27.417
I'd see her and her son walk
along the road into town.

51:28.502 --> 51:29.711
They didn't have a car.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.174
Landlady found the bodies.

51:37.219 --> 51:38.470
They had been dead...

51:40.680 --> 51:41.681
four days.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.773
What people won't do to each other.

51:50.941 --> 51:52.526
Nothing people won't do.

51:54.653 --> 51:55.862
How can we help?

51:58.615 --> 52:01.618
[McGraw]  She was found cuffed
and lashed to the bed.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.538
A broomstick perforated her rectum.

52:05.539 --> 52:07.791
Whoever it was made the boy watch,

52:09.376 --> 52:11.169
then did the same thing to him.

52:12.420 --> 52:13.463
How'd he get in?

52:13.839 --> 52:16.633
Bathroom window.
We think that's how he came and went.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.677
There was no sign of forcible entry.

52:19.427 --> 52:21.513
-No one heard a peep.
-In a rooming house?

52:21.596 --> 52:25.225
My assumption is, he held a knife
to the boy to keep her quiet,

52:26.059 --> 52:27.269
and vice versa.

52:27.352 --> 52:29.729
This falls clearly
into the category of lust murder.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.523
By that I mean it's sexually motivated.

52:31.606 --> 52:34.067
That cannot be about horny.

52:34.151 --> 52:37.904
It's more about sexual gratification
through the annihilation of another.

52:38.238 --> 52:40.991
-Did you find semen?
-Found some on a throw cushion.

52:41.074 --> 52:44.077
It was blood type O.
I know that's not much help.

52:44.160 --> 52:45.912
-[Tench] In the victims?
-[McGraw] No.

52:46.788 --> 52:49.082
-He didn't rape them.
-He could have problems with sex.

52:49.165 --> 52:50.417
That'd be a good bet.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.127
Could narrow things with your suspects.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.753
I don't have suspects.

52:53.837 --> 52:56.798
I don't have fingerprints, shoe prints,

52:56.882 --> 52:58.675
not so much as a single hair.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.176
Well...

53:00.260 --> 53:02.721
The fact that the killer
left nothing behind is interesting.

53:02.804 --> 53:04.848
It must have been premeditated
to a degree.

53:04.931 --> 53:08.101
He had gloves,
he cleaned up after himself.

53:08.184 --> 53:09.728
You think he was stalking her?

53:09.811 --> 53:12.397
-Or she just caught his eye.
-What about the boy?

53:13.023 --> 53:14.024
He was a witness.

53:14.107 --> 53:16.526
There are more expedient ways
to get rid of a witness.

53:16.610 --> 53:18.862
-Why make the boy watch?
-And why sodomize him?

53:18.945 --> 53:20.113
[Holden] That's a good point.

53:20.655 --> 53:23.783
Is this crime about the woman
or about the child?

53:27.120 --> 53:30.040
-You're asking me?
-I was just posing questions.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.751
I get that.

53:32.834 --> 53:34.502
-The broomstick.
-Yeah?

53:34.586 --> 53:37.505
Is it the same broomstick
she used to sweep the church steps?

53:37.589 --> 53:39.716
-What if it is?
-He might not be a congregant,

53:39.799 --> 53:44.012
maybe someone just passing through,
but the church could be significant.

53:44.095 --> 53:45.013
Could be?

53:45.096 --> 53:47.223
[Holden] With the idea of service.

53:48.308 --> 53:52.145
I think that there's a passage in Mark.

53:52.228 --> 53:54.648
Something about the "Son of Man."

53:55.482 --> 53:56.900
I don't follow.

53:56.983 --> 53:59.444
[Holden] All I'm saying is,
the broom may mean something.

53:59.527 --> 54:00.528
What?

54:02.155 --> 54:03.198
I don't know.

54:03.281 --> 54:05.241

54:12.582 --> 54:14.501
and some stranger came along and...

54:16.169 --> 54:19.422
Come on, Agent Ford,
you got fancy methods.

54:19.506 --> 54:23.843
What does a broomstick in the ass
of a dirt poor single mom mean?

54:29.391 --> 54:30.558
I don't know.

54:31.267 --> 54:32.435
You're kidding me.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.687
I don't understand it.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.941
-We can't help you with this.
-We need more time to go over this.

54:38.024 --> 54:42.028
We are in the dark here.
We don't know any more than you do.

54:44.030 --> 54:45.865
How fucking dare you?

54:46.700 --> 54:48.368
I'm sorry we wasted your time.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.793
-Can I get these back to you?

55:35.749 --> 55:38.501
I have studied everything we have.
I've taken this ride here,

55:38.585 --> 55:40.795
listened to everything
you've been kind enough to teach,

55:40.879 --> 55:43.715
but we're talking about something
we don't understand in the slightest.

55:43.798 --> 55:44.883
I was trying to help you.

55:44.966 --> 55:47.302
If you don't like it,
go back to your college kids

55:47.385 --> 55:48.428
and we'll forget about it.

55:48.511 --> 55:49.888
Ada and her son were killed

55:49.971 --> 55:52.182
for reasons we are simply not equipped
to understand.

55:52.265 --> 55:53.767
It wasn't lust murder.

55:53.850 --> 55:56.644
It wasn't some random thrill killer
who was born bad,

55:56.728 --> 55:59.439
and it wasn't a pantie thief
who wanted to change things up.

55:59.522 --> 56:00.815
It was an aberration.

56:00.899 --> 56:02.901
Let me tell you something
about aberrant behavior.

56:02.984 --> 56:04.235
It's fucking aberrant.

56:04.319 --> 56:06.780
If we understood it, we'd be aberrant too.

56:06.863 --> 56:09.532
Fortunately, it's not incumbent upon us
to write a dissertation.

56:09.616 --> 56:11.159
-Well, maybe we should.
-Why?

56:12.243 --> 56:15.830
Our job is to give him something
he could not have figured out himself.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.541
-I am sticking my neck out for you.
-No disrespect.

56:18.625 --> 56:22.295
At the moment, I don't think we can say
anything to McGraw with any certainty.

56:22.378 --> 56:24.506
Let me ask you something.
Where are you from?

56:26.633 --> 56:29.511
I was born in New York,
but it's kind of a mixed bag.

56:29.594 --> 56:32.722
Okay. Well, that's what you are
right now, a mixed bag.

56:33.223 --> 56:35.850
A little college education,
some experience on the street,

56:35.934 --> 56:38.061
some insight, a lot of horseshit.

56:38.144 --> 56:39.687
I agree with you.

56:39.771 --> 56:42.107
It's been one step forward,
two steps back.

56:42.190 --> 56:44.567
Let me ask you something else.
Do you have a girlfriend?

56:45.527 --> 56:47.987
-I do now, Bill, as it happens.
-Okay.

56:48.071 --> 56:52.075
So next time you're a long way from home
and you flip your shit,

56:52.158 --> 56:55.703
you find a pay phone
and you tell it to your girlfriend.

56:56.454 --> 56:57.539
-Okay?
-Okay.

56:57.622 --> 57:00.500
-How's that sound?
-It sounds okay, Bill.
