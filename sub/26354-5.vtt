00:20.711 --> 00:23.445
Belchers, I've been
going over the detention records,

00:23.470 --> 00:26.093
and you kids owe five
hours of detention.

00:26.117 --> 00:28.617
So, we suffer from
detention deficit disorder.

00:28.686 --> 00:30.486
Yeah, shouldn't that
get us out of detention?

00:30.555 --> 00:32.253
No! You're detention dodgers.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.756
Medical excuses,

00:33.825 --> 00:34.991
religious holidays,

00:35.059 --> 00:36.425
conscientious objections.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.893
It's time to pay up.

00:37.962 --> 00:40.096
But five hours? That's like five days.

00:40.164 --> 00:43.067
Well, you can do the hard time, or...

00:43.092 --> 00:45.634
you can help me with a
special project I'm working on.

00:45.703 --> 00:47.403
Instead of serving out

00:47.438 --> 00:48.804
your detention sentence,

00:48.873 --> 00:50.740
you can appear in my music video.

00:50.808 --> 00:51.941
Ugh, pass.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.387
No, no, no. No, wait,
wait, wait, hang on.

00:53.411 --> 00:57.223
I need you kids to help me get
this video done. Like, today.

00:57.248 --> 00:58.881
Maybe throw in a hundred dollars?

00:58.916 --> 01:00.816
Deal! N-No, wait, what am I saying?

01:00.885 --> 01:03.535
Listen, there's a week-long
guidance counselor conference

01:03.560 --> 01:05.798
this week here in town. Counsel-Con.

01:05.823 --> 01:08.290
Yeah, that Counsel-Con.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.959
- That sounds fun.
- A lot of cat sitters

01:10.028 --> 01:11.028
getting work this week.

01:11.095 --> 01:12.095
It is fun.

01:12.130 --> 01:13.173
Except I'm in charge of, like,

01:13.197 --> 01:14.697
six things on the welcome committee.

01:14.766 --> 01:16.366
And, trust me, none
of these prima Donnas

01:16.434 --> 01:18.134
even open their welcome envelope.

01:18.202 --> 01:20.803
They put the "diva" in
"child de-velopment."

01:20.872 --> 01:22.238
They probably won't even appreciate

01:22.306 --> 01:23.973
that I got the ocean
view conference room

01:24.042 --> 01:25.307
at the Spinnaker Hotel.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.687
And thank you for reminding me...

01:26.711 --> 01:28.752
I can't find a friggin' cat sitter.

01:28.777 --> 01:31.547
So it's up to you.
Do the rhyme or do the time.

01:31.616 --> 01:32.882
My video has rhymes in it.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.303
Ugh, fine.

01:34.328 --> 01:36.562
Oh, look at Busta Rhymes over here.

01:36.587 --> 01:39.488
What you doing, Teddy?
You making a little hat?

01:39.557 --> 01:41.891
No, I-I'm making a
paper airplane. All done.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.671
That's not gonna win
me a washing machine.

01:45.696 --> 01:47.530
- Washing machine?
- Yeah, there's gonna be

01:47.598 --> 01:49.698
a paper airplane contest
at the air show on Saturday.

01:49.734 --> 01:51.534
The washing machine's the grand prize.

01:51.569 --> 01:54.249
So, wait, you throw paper
airplanes at an air show?

01:54.274 --> 01:56.649
Isn't that like bringing a
stuffed animal to the zoo?

01:56.674 --> 01:58.093
I did that once.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.918
I wanted to see what their reaction was.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.187
- They liked it.
- Yeah, halfway through the show,

02:02.222 --> 02:03.655
there's a paper airplane contest.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.935
They put a washing machine on
the runway with the door open,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.493
and everyone tosses their paper
airplanes from the bleachers.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.273
And then there's other
appliances out there, too.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.941
You put your name on the
plane, and if you get it

02:11.965 --> 02:13.565
in the toaster, you win the toaster.

02:13.634 --> 02:14.811
And if you get it in the Crock-Pot,

02:14.835 --> 02:16.001
you win the Crock-Pot!

02:16.069 --> 02:17.069
It sounds easy!

02:17.104 --> 02:18.304
Definitely doesn't sound easy.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.323
But we could use a new washing machine.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.941
Oh. Yeah. Ours smells like
something died in there.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.909
Well, it's because that
mouse died in there.

02:24.934 --> 02:27.034
Yeah, he died 'cause it smelled so bad.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.248
Okay, Bob's the best
folder, I'm the best thrower.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.083
- You're not the best thrower.
- What?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.252
All your throws hook to the left, Bob.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.121
You're a hooker, like my cousin Marie.

02:36.189 --> 02:37.722
Your cousin Marie's a prostitute?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.891
No, she throws paper airplanes like you.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.896
- It's your mechanics.
- So, it's settled.

02:41.921 --> 02:44.229
I'm the best at throwing,
you're the best at folding.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.964
Eh. And I'm the guy who kind of regrets

02:45.989 --> 02:47.922
telling you guys about
this. Just kidding.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.801

- Oh, you're not? You're not?

03:03.950 --> 03:04.883
- No.
- Oh, wow.

03:04.951 --> 03:05.884
Can we get a copy of this?

03:05.952 --> 03:06.992
Mom would love this video.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.219
Mom doesn't get to see this.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.487
No one we know will see this.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.523
- That was the deal, Mr. Frond.
- Don't worry.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.758
"The Empathize Glide"
is only gonna be viewed

03:13.827 --> 03:15.527
at the Counsel-Con welcome banquet.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.029
Unless it impresses Judith,
because she sets the curriculum

03:18.065 --> 03:19.798
- for the whole state.
- Excuse me?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.477
Doesn't matter. It's
just a proof of concept.

03:21.501 --> 03:24.169
I'd get actually talented
kids to be in the real thing.

03:24.194 --> 03:25.394
Thank you. Wait, what?

03:25.505 --> 03:27.272
You absolutely, positively promise

03:27.297 --> 03:29.563
that no one at school
will see this video?

03:29.676 --> 03:33.378
You have my word as an
educator/rapper/healer.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.419
Oh, no.

03:43.423 --> 03:46.124
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

03:46.193 --> 03:47.592
This can't be happening!

03:47.627 --> 03:48.627
It's happening.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.195
It's really brave of you to be here

03:50.263 --> 03:52.263
at school and not hiding
in the woods forever.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.499
Tina, you look really
weird in that video.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.535
Right, but like a sassy, fun,
"you want to walk to school

03:57.571 --> 03:59.604
- with me every day" weird?
- No, weird like I feel

03:59.673 --> 04:01.940
like I should help you
or give money to a charity

04:02.008 --> 04:03.508
that helps people like you.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.510
Mr. Frond.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.279
Ah! Okay, I-I see that you are

04:08.348 --> 04:10.115
processing recent developments.

04:10.183 --> 04:13.118
Perhaps, uh, Process-ily
Cecily could help.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.153
Process-ily Cecily can process her ass!

04:15.222 --> 04:17.122
You promised that no one

04:17.190 --> 04:19.991
at school would see us singing
and dancing in your dumb video!

04:20.060 --> 04:22.238
Hold his arms! We're gonna
make it look like an accident!

04:22.262 --> 04:23.395
Easy, girl!

04:23.463 --> 04:24.629
It's not my fault.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.798
I was editing the video
on the library computer

04:26.867 --> 04:29.200
when nature called. I got
up without logging out,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.736
and when I came back, the
kids were watching the video.

04:31.805 --> 04:35.306
Ah! You always log out
before outing a log!

04:35.375 --> 04:36.808
Okay.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.710
That's healthy. You vented.

04:38.745 --> 04:40.412
And, yes, I promised.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.147
But there's nothing we can do now.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.882
This isn't over, Frond.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.317
There's only one way to
deal with this bull-crap.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.052
- We got to...
- Kill something he loves?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.888
- Oh, my!
- Maybe not kill.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.891
- But definitely revenge.
- Aw!

04:52.926 --> 04:55.147
I'd just gotten it out of my head,

04:55.172 --> 04:56.905
and then I see you kids again.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.697
♪ Em-pad-Thais. ♪

05:03.643 --> 05:05.735
A million hours of detention
would have been better

05:05.760 --> 05:07.282
than winding up as Frond's puppets.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.657
He humiliated us. We need
to do the same to him.

05:09.682 --> 05:11.382
Counsel-Con.

05:11.451 --> 05:14.084
Yes! We become the world's
youngest guidance counselors

05:14.109 --> 05:17.077
and show him up while helping
a lot of people along the way.

05:17.102 --> 05:20.268
No, he called the other
counselors "divas," remember?

05:20.293 --> 05:22.860
What if we get Frond
trash-talking them on video

05:22.885 --> 05:25.485
and then post it somewhere for
the whole conference to see?

05:25.510 --> 05:27.075
But how do we get them all to watch it?

05:27.099 --> 05:28.911
He's got to be there and
suffer like we suffered.

05:28.935 --> 05:30.361
Right.

05:30.937 --> 05:33.471
Guys, we just found our solution.

05:33.506 --> 05:34.705
We get divorced?

05:34.774 --> 05:36.273
- No.
- Oh, phew.

05:36.342 --> 05:39.076
Ooh... Whoa.

05:39.145 --> 05:41.145
Okay, after we get video of Mr. Frond

05:41.214 --> 05:43.280
talking trash about his friends,

05:43.349 --> 05:44.827
we'll put the link on an
airplane banner that says

05:44.851 --> 05:46.750
"hottest cats for guidance counselors."

05:46.819 --> 05:48.552
And when it flies by
the Spinnaker Hotel...

05:48.621 --> 05:50.999
Every single one of them
will pull it up on their phones,

05:51.023 --> 05:53.157
and Mr. Frond will be
completely humiliated.

05:53.192 --> 05:54.225
Crushed.

05:54.293 --> 05:56.648
Humiliated, crushed, and destroyed.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.113
Like every buffet
after I'm done with it.

05:59.165 --> 06:01.432
Lin, you want to weigh in
on which airplane design

06:01.467 --> 06:02.366
to go with?

06:02.391 --> 06:04.768
This one, you have to do
over 60 precision folds.

06:04.837 --> 06:06.770
And Barry recommends finishing it off

06:06.795 --> 06:08.483
with a four-degree dihedral angle.

06:08.508 --> 06:09.940
Barry? Who's Barry?

06:09.965 --> 06:10.975
Barry B. Foldin'. He wrote this book.

06:11.043 --> 06:12.409
He's a genius.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.678
Wait, you bought a book
about paper airplanes?

06:14.703 --> 06:16.536
Not a book, Lin, the book.

06:16.561 --> 06:19.362
Barry is a legend in the
paper aviation community.

06:19.387 --> 06:20.552
Wait, what's that thing?

06:20.577 --> 06:23.078
- It's my folding tool.
- You can't just use your finger?

06:23.103 --> 06:24.398
Uh, no.

06:24.438 --> 06:27.125
Not when you're building a
competition-grade aircraft, Lin.

06:27.159 --> 06:28.599
This is probably the best ten dollars

06:28.628 --> 06:29.827
I've ever spent.

06:29.852 --> 06:32.486
That thing cost ten dollars?
How much did the book cost?

06:32.511 --> 06:33.621
I-I don't want to talk about it.

06:35.172 --> 06:37.868
You might not want to overdo it
with the arm strengthening, Lin.

06:37.937 --> 06:39.403
You worry about your folds,

06:39.472 --> 06:41.038
mama's gonna bring home the gold.

06:41.107 --> 06:42.506
Washing machine gold. Whoo!

06:42.542 --> 06:44.775
Oh, I am using the wrong paper.

06:44.844 --> 06:46.377
Oh, my God. I-I gotta go.

06:46.412 --> 06:48.779
I'll be right back.

06:48.804 --> 06:51.271
Hi, uh, I-I need to buy some paper.

06:51.296 --> 06:54.397
This is an art store. Be
specific, for God's sakes!

06:54.422 --> 06:57.231
Yeah. Do you go in a liquor
store and say, "I need liquor"?

06:57.256 --> 06:58.556
Yeah, I bet he does.

06:58.581 --> 07:02.467
Okay, I-I need 24-pound A4
paper. Do you know what that is?

07:02.492 --> 07:05.529
- Ah, making paper airplanes?
- Yeah, is that the right paper?

07:05.598 --> 07:06.598
For an amateur, sure.

07:06.632 --> 07:09.366
W-Wait, what's for
more of a professional?

07:09.435 --> 07:11.368
No, you can't handle
it. You can't afford it.

07:11.437 --> 07:12.563
Can I see it?

07:12.588 --> 07:14.138
- No!
- Please?

07:14.206 --> 07:16.006
- Fine.
- Harold, lock the door.

07:16.075 --> 07:17.308
Put on the gloves. Show him.

07:23.082 --> 07:25.583
Good God, it's beautiful.

07:25.651 --> 07:26.817
Stop breathing on it.

07:26.886 --> 07:28.752
W-W-Wait-wait-wait. How much?

07:28.821 --> 07:30.387
How much are you willing to spend?

07:30.456 --> 07:31.522
Everything.

07:31.547 --> 07:33.380
- How much do you want?
- All of it.

07:33.405 --> 07:34.638
Harold, we're closing early.

07:34.794 --> 07:37.061
Tonight we drink wine out of a bottle.

07:37.516 --> 07:40.431
Hey, Mr. Frond, sorry about yesterday.

07:40.499 --> 07:42.433
We were cuckoo bonkers.

07:42.501 --> 07:46.203
I think Counsel-Con is just
making all of us crazy, right?

07:46.272 --> 07:47.905
Ah, don't get me started.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.829
Do you mind if I put my
groceries on your desk?

07:49.854 --> 07:51.719
- Ignore the hole.
- Sure, go ahead.

07:51.744 --> 07:53.144
I'm sorry, you were saying something

07:53.179 --> 07:56.930
about Counsel-Con going
smooth, loving the people...

07:56.955 --> 07:59.483
Oh, the people. Gary, carrying his own

07:59.552 --> 08:02.252
gluten-free snacks
everywhere, making comments.

08:02.321 --> 08:04.121
And June Wilson with the perfume.

08:04.190 --> 08:05.889
What happened, did
you fall in the bottle?

08:05.958 --> 08:07.958
But everyone's super cool, right?

08:08.027 --> 08:11.428
No. Why does guidance counseling
attract the most uncool people?

08:11.497 --> 08:13.597
If I had to rank them
from stiff to stiffest,

08:13.666 --> 08:15.899
dead last would be Gilbert McDougal.

08:15.924 --> 08:17.045
And not because of his neck brace,

08:17.069 --> 08:18.636
I'm talking personality only.

08:18.661 --> 08:20.973
And then probably Manoj...

08:20.998 --> 08:22.706
We got him. We got him so good.

08:22.731 --> 08:24.118
- Did we run out of tape?
- Yeah.

08:24.143 --> 08:25.454
He just ignored the rewinding sound

08:25.478 --> 08:27.277
- and kept talking.
- Phase one complete.

08:27.346 --> 08:29.546
We upload this sucker,

08:29.615 --> 08:31.281
and then phase three.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.542
Okay, so after we make our own banner,

08:36.567 --> 08:38.756
we come back here, switch 'em out,

08:38.823 --> 08:40.924
and then that plane
flies our revenge banner

08:40.993 --> 08:42.926
in front of the Spinnaker Hotel, and...

08:42.995 --> 08:44.962
Hey, you aren't supposed
to be on the airstrip.

08:45.031 --> 08:47.631
Sure we are. We're the new flight crew.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.266
Hot towel? Hot towel?

08:49.335 --> 08:51.301
Wait, you kids look familiar.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.603
Oh, yeah. You, too.

08:52.628 --> 08:53.638
You once tried to make out with our mom,

08:53.663 --> 08:54.663
but she kicked your butt.

08:54.774 --> 08:56.306
I'm gonna need more than that.

08:56.331 --> 08:58.264
I'm kidding. I remember you guys.

08:58.289 --> 09:00.356
How's your mom? She still with your dad?

09:00.381 --> 09:02.381
Yep, and she and I have our thing, too,

09:02.406 --> 09:03.958
so back off, fly-boy!

09:03.983 --> 09:06.784
Wait, why are you here?
Aren't you a seaplane pilot?

09:06.819 --> 09:08.786
I took the pontoons off Shoshana

09:08.811 --> 09:10.177
so I can fly banner ads,

09:10.202 --> 09:12.869
since my sexy flight lesson
business kinda dried up.

09:12.894 --> 09:15.027
So, why are you kids
sneaking onto the airfield?

09:15.052 --> 09:17.905
Drug smuggling? Muling? You kids muling?

09:17.930 --> 09:19.863
No, we're trying to get revenge.

09:19.888 --> 09:21.421
Revenge, eh?

09:21.446 --> 09:23.245
Yeah, we want to humiliate this guy

09:23.270 --> 09:25.503
who basically destroyed our lives.

09:25.528 --> 09:28.816
Interesting. Life is a
funny mistress sometimes.

09:28.841 --> 09:31.909
Get this. My nemesis is coming
to town for the air show,

09:31.944 --> 09:34.712
and I was literally just
brainstorming on my revenge.

09:34.737 --> 09:37.605
But bumping into you sneaky
weasels gives me an idea.

09:37.630 --> 09:38.895
You want to raise weasels?

09:38.920 --> 09:42.522
No, a proposition. I'll
fly a revenge banner for you

09:42.547 --> 09:45.399
- if you help me get my revenge.
- Deal.

09:45.424 --> 09:47.458
Oh, look at you agreeing before you know

09:47.526 --> 09:50.670
- any of the weird details.
- That's the Belcher way.

09:54.491 --> 09:56.658
Hey, Gus, look who I
found on the airfield.

09:56.694 --> 09:58.427
They're gonna help me
with my revenge plan.

09:58.495 --> 09:59.661
That's nice.

09:59.730 --> 10:01.997
So, Kurt, who's the target? Is it...

10:02.066 --> 10:02.998
Hey, what?!

10:03.067 --> 10:04.266
No, it's a stunt pilot.

10:04.335 --> 10:06.401
All you need to know is she's pure evil.

10:06.470 --> 10:07.870
Her name is Laverne.

10:07.938 --> 10:09.238
Kurt and Laverne used to be part

10:09.306 --> 10:11.406
of a stunt flying team, until she stole

10:11.475 --> 10:12.941
the Dice N' Slice from Kurt

10:13.010 --> 10:14.509
and made him look ridiculous!

10:14.534 --> 10:16.901
- Okay, easy, Gus.
- Sorry, I got excited.

10:16.981 --> 10:18.380
What's a Dice N' Slice?

10:18.449 --> 10:20.782
It's the best aerial
acrobatic stunt ever.

10:20.851 --> 10:22.491
I'd worked on it for
months with my coach,

10:22.519 --> 10:24.219
and was about to unveil it to the world,

10:24.288 --> 10:25.721
but she stole it from me.

10:25.789 --> 10:27.100
And that's all I'm gonna say about that.

10:27.124 --> 10:29.258
Yeah, that's all he's
gonna say about that.

10:29.326 --> 10:30.737
Okay, fine, I'll tell you everything.

10:30.761 --> 10:32.227
Whoa, I was wrong.

10:32.263 --> 10:34.096
It was 20 years ago,

10:34.131 --> 10:35.564
at the nationals.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.132
Go on.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.967
I watched Laverne's plane dice roll,

10:39.036 --> 10:40.769
and then I watched it slice.

10:40.968 --> 10:43.405
I was determined to
out-dice and out-slice her,

10:43.474 --> 10:46.275
so I pushed that plane
and my body to the limits.

10:46.343 --> 10:48.443
I was upside down, pulling so many Gs.

10:48.479 --> 10:49.978
And also I'd had a massive breakfast

10:50.047 --> 10:51.213
at the airfield café.

10:51.282 --> 10:52.814
It was free for us stunt pilots.

10:52.839 --> 10:55.440
I mean, who wouldn't have had
two orders of huevos rancheros?

10:55.596 --> 10:58.497
The g-force made it
all come plopping down.

10:58.522 --> 11:00.622
What do you mean "It
all came plopping down"?

11:00.658 --> 11:02.328
- He pooped the pit.
- Gus!

11:02.353 --> 11:03.556
You did.

11:03.581 --> 11:06.929
Ah. It's true, just as I was
passing the judges' table.

11:06.964 --> 11:08.664
So, bonus points for style?

11:08.732 --> 11:11.667
I wish. Three things I
haven't done since that day...

11:11.735 --> 11:15.070
Talked to Laverne, go upside
down under any circumstances,

11:15.095 --> 11:16.615
eat huevos rancheros.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.573
Those are the best kind of huevos!

11:18.642 --> 11:20.475
How are we gonna get her back?

11:20.511 --> 11:21.814
Here's the plan.

11:21.839 --> 11:24.413
Laverne always take pictures
with fans before a show.

11:24.481 --> 11:27.992
I want you kids to pose
as fans, then use these...

11:28.017 --> 11:29.662
- What are those?
- Wire cutters.

11:29.687 --> 11:31.520
I want you to go under her plane

11:31.588 --> 11:33.989
and snip the red ignition
wire, the blue fuel line,

11:34.058 --> 11:35.524
and whatever the black wire is.

11:35.549 --> 11:37.149
Uh, we're not cutting anyone's wires.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.660
Well, I can't do it!

11:38.729 --> 11:40.762
Ever since she caught
me trying to put a banana

11:40.831 --> 11:42.698
in her plane pipe, she
hired security guards.

11:42.766 --> 11:45.334
That's why I need you
kids to do it for me.

11:45.402 --> 11:47.936
What gives?! I thought
we were revenge twins.

11:48.005 --> 11:50.205
We are, we are, but
maybe there's another way

11:50.274 --> 11:52.274
for you to get revenge on Laverne

11:52.343 --> 11:54.509
without her having to
emergency-land her plane,

11:54.578 --> 11:56.979
- possibly dying.
- Can't think of one.

11:57.047 --> 11:58.447
Why don't you just beat her

11:58.472 --> 12:00.017
in the stunt flying
competition at the air show?

12:00.042 --> 12:01.331
Wouldn't that be the sweetest revenge?

12:01.356 --> 12:02.792
Yeah, do the Dice N' Slice,

12:02.817 --> 12:04.330
and ideally without pooping the pit.

12:04.355 --> 12:05.854
Didn't you hear me?!

12:05.879 --> 12:07.833
I don't go upside down anymore.

12:07.858 --> 12:10.325
- I can't fly upside down.

12:10.394 --> 12:12.995
I can't do it.

12:13.063 --> 12:15.297
Oh, wow. Okay.

12:15.366 --> 12:17.032
Hey, bu-buddy...

12:17.057 --> 12:20.179
Uh, you just need a little
help getting upside down again.

12:20.204 --> 12:21.970
We can do that. Huh? We're kids.

12:22.039 --> 12:23.505
We're good at going upside down.

12:23.574 --> 12:25.518
Yeah, I'm not super
comfortable going upside down.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.175
- Tina, just be quiet.
- Okay.

12:27.211 --> 12:30.178
New deal... we help you get
your upside-down mojo back

12:30.247 --> 12:32.514
and beat Laverne, you
fly our revenge banner

12:32.539 --> 12:34.272
so we can destroy Frond.

12:34.297 --> 12:35.928
Uh... fine.

12:35.953 --> 12:38.520
♪ Dice, slice ♪

12:39.590 --> 12:41.590
♪ Fold ♪

12:41.658 --> 12:43.859
♪ Nice ♪

12:43.927 --> 12:46.862
♪ Toss in there ♪

12:47.726 --> 12:50.227
♪ Upside-down hair. ♪

12:56.240 --> 12:58.173
Hello, Bob.

12:58.242 --> 13:01.009
- Barry B. Foldin'?
- Yes, I be.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.078
I see you have Bowfinger in your hand.

13:03.147 --> 13:04.613
Y-Yeah. I'm-I'm
trying to choose

13:04.681 --> 13:06.681
between Bowfinger and
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel

13:06.750 --> 13:09.217
- for the big contest.
- Both great options.

13:09.253 --> 13:10.786
So, Bob, what's the hold-up?

13:10.854 --> 13:13.288
I can't decide which plane is the best.

13:13.357 --> 13:15.290
The answer is in your hand.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.459
- Whoa!
- It's called

13:17.494 --> 13:19.227
"What About Bob?"

13:19.252 --> 13:21.774
It's the best fold from
my best planes combined.

13:21.799 --> 13:23.715
Go ahead. Fling it.

13:24.368 --> 13:26.735
Whoa!

13:26.804 --> 13:29.536
It's flying so far!

13:31.975 --> 13:33.942
Aah! I got to fold! I got to fold!

13:34.011 --> 13:35.577
Oh, wha... wha... ?

13:36.438 --> 13:37.712
Look up.

13:37.781 --> 13:39.714
It's a bird, it's a plane.

13:39.783 --> 13:41.716
Just kidding. It's a plane!

13:41.785 --> 13:43.718
Look who decided to waltz on in...

13:43.787 --> 13:45.587
The Wind Waltzers, that's who.

13:45.656 --> 13:47.489
Let's hear it for 'em, folks.

13:51.829 --> 13:53.328
Where'd the kids go?

13:53.363 --> 13:56.313
They said they were gonna go find
healthy snacks. Might take a while.

13:56.338 --> 13:58.384
Can I sit next to you
until they come back?

13:58.409 --> 14:00.212
Uh, that's where the plane's sitting,

14:00.237 --> 14:02.881
-but you can sit next to the plane.
- Uh, okay.

14:02.906 --> 14:04.272
There she is.

14:04.341 --> 14:05.941
There you go, sweetheart.

14:06.009 --> 14:07.175
She seems nice.

14:07.244 --> 14:09.277
Hello, Laverne.

14:09.346 --> 14:11.513
Well, well, well.

14:11.582 --> 14:13.849
If it isn't Kurt. What? No banana?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.283
He doesn't need bananas anymore.

14:15.352 --> 14:17.152
- He's got us.
- Who are you?

14:17.221 --> 14:19.855
I've been training with them
for the past 48 hours straight,

14:19.923 --> 14:21.990
not counting a date I
had, which went medium.

14:22.059 --> 14:25.305
Doesn't matter how much you
train, fella. I'm the best.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.964
It's like Dad always said...
Training's for trains, these are planes.

14:29.032 --> 14:31.133
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Dad?!

14:31.201 --> 14:32.601
Yeah, Dad was our coach.

14:32.669 --> 14:34.269
Laverne is your sister?

14:34.338 --> 14:37.038
Laverne hasn't been my sister
since she stole my move.

14:37.107 --> 14:39.508
I don't have any sisters!
But, yeah, she's my sister.

14:39.576 --> 14:41.042
Stole your move?

14:41.067 --> 14:43.388
You tried to steal the
Dice N' Slice from me.

14:43.413 --> 14:45.447
Pssh! What?! Nuh-uh, liar!

14:45.516 --> 14:47.182
Well, it's my move!

14:47.251 --> 14:49.184
My move, and I'm taking it back.

14:49.253 --> 14:51.097
First up in the trick 
flying competition...

14:51.121 --> 14:52.487
Kurt Enerny!

14:52.556 --> 14:53.889
Well, good luck up there.

14:53.957 --> 14:56.491
Try not to poop the pit.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.360
Oh, my God, she's gonna crush me!

14:58.428 --> 15:00.216
I can't do this!

15:00.241 --> 15:03.175
And why did I have huevos
rancheros for breakfast today?

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
- Ow!
- You listen to me.

15:05.235 --> 15:06.801
You're gonna get up in the sky

15:06.870 --> 15:08.637
and win this trick flying competition,

15:08.705 --> 15:10.683
then tow our banner in
front of the Spinnaker Hotel.

15:10.707 --> 15:12.741
Today is the day for revenge!

15:12.809 --> 15:15.410
Now squeeze your cheeks
and soar like an eagle!

15:20.452 --> 15:22.317
He's pulling three Gs up there.

15:22.386 --> 15:23.652
Hey, what's it feel like, Kurt?

15:23.720 --> 15:25.064
Like my kidneys are playing patty-cake

15:25.088 --> 15:26.555
with my intestines.

15:26.623 --> 15:28.857
And here comes the Dice N' Slice,

15:28.926 --> 15:30.992
made famous by another stunt pilot.

15:31.061 --> 15:32.661
Who stole it from me!

15:32.729 --> 15:35.030
- Here we go.
- Come on, Kurt.

15:35.098 --> 15:37.488
Here's the intentional stall-out,

15:38.340 --> 15:40.235
followed by the dice roll.

15:41.972 --> 15:45.040
And here comes the slice!

15:45.108 --> 15:47.175
He's doing it. He's upside down,

15:47.211 --> 15:48.743
and he's not pooping.

15:48.812 --> 15:51.446
- Probably.
- Come on, finish your revenge,

15:51.515 --> 15:52.781
so we can have ours!

15:56.920 --> 15:58.620
I did it! I'm back!

15:58.689 --> 16:01.856
The Dice N' Slice belongs to me.

16:01.925 --> 16:03.892
Uh, Kurt, you missed the ribbon, pal,

16:03.961 --> 16:05.694
by 50, maybe 60 feet.

16:05.762 --> 16:08.063
Oh, no! Did the judges see?

16:08.131 --> 16:09.531
Yes, the judges saw.

16:09.600 --> 16:10.865
They have pretty good seats.

16:10.901 --> 16:12.267
Ah, Kurt!

16:12.336 --> 16:14.369
Serves him right for
trying to steal my move.

16:14.438 --> 16:17.038
I trained for months with Dad
perfecting the Dice N' Slice.

16:17.107 --> 16:19.874
Wait. What? Kurt said their
dad taught him that move.

16:19.943 --> 16:21.788
Now who's ready
to see the Dice N' Slice

16:21.812 --> 16:23.211
by the best?

16:23.280 --> 16:26.615
Put your hands together
for Laverne Enerny.

16:26.683 --> 16:29.217
New plan. Go back to my old plan.

16:29.286 --> 16:31.419
Well, at least you kids talked Kurt out

16:31.488 --> 16:33.875
of doing something stupid and dangerous.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.135
I guess, and we'll still get
our revenge on Mr. Frond, so...

16:37.160 --> 16:38.627
Uh, what's Kurt doing?

16:38.695 --> 16:41.179
Something stupid and dangerous!

16:44.531 --> 16:48.131
Well, folks, uh, it looks 
like the solo competition

16:48.156 --> 16:52.025
has turned into a...
completely planned, uh,

16:52.093 --> 16:54.494
World War I dogfight reenactment.

16:54.563 --> 16:57.063
Who's that behind you, Laverne? It's me.

16:57.098 --> 17:00.500
Aw. Try that again,
moron, and I'll do this.

17:00.569 --> 17:03.203
I hate your guts so much, turd face!

17:03.271 --> 17:06.271
Uh, World War I pilots would
often say that to each other.

17:06.340 --> 17:08.007
Completely authentic dogfight.

17:08.076 --> 17:10.343
Ugh! She didn't even steal
the Dice N' Slice from him,

17:10.412 --> 17:11.877
and he didn't steal it from her.

17:11.946 --> 17:13.512
Wait. What are you talking about, Tina?

17:13.582 --> 17:15.381
Their dad trained them
both to do that move,

17:15.450 --> 17:17.228
and neither of them know
it. We have to tell them.

17:17.252 --> 17:18.785
Kind of hard to tell them that now.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.954
They're way up there,
and we're way down here.

17:21.021 --> 17:22.376
Stupid gravity!

17:22.401 --> 17:24.401
You could talk to them on the radio.

17:24.425 --> 17:25.892
Use the one in this plane.

17:26.638 --> 17:28.361
Kurt, can you hear me?

17:28.430 --> 17:30.530
Yes, but I'm a little busy
right now trying to knock

17:30.599 --> 17:32.465
my sister out of the
sky. Can't wait to see

17:32.500 --> 17:35.168
the look on your face,
Laverne, when you emergency-land

17:35.237 --> 17:37.070
- like a dork.
- Not if you

17:37.105 --> 17:39.292
emergency-land first, you double dork.

17:39.317 --> 17:42.285
Stop fighting! You're both double dorks.

17:42.310 --> 17:44.310
Why are the kids part of the air show?

17:44.379 --> 17:46.312
- Is this for school?
- Maybe.

17:46.381 --> 17:48.548
I mean, we never help
them with school stuff,

17:48.617 --> 17:50.316
so we really wouldn't know.

17:50.385 --> 17:53.152
Guys, knock it off. No one
stole the Dice N' Slice.

17:53.221 --> 17:55.655
What do you mean, "No one
stole the Dice N' Slice"?

17:55.724 --> 17:57.368
You both trained with
your dad to create that move.

17:57.392 --> 17:59.559
Then he must have lied to both of you

17:59.628 --> 18:01.138
when he said the other person stole it.

18:01.162 --> 18:02.773
But why would he pit
us against each other?

18:02.797 --> 18:05.565
Maybe he thought if we competed,
it would bring out our best,

18:05.634 --> 18:07.778
like how he used to put that
one present under the tree

18:07.802 --> 18:09.168
and make us wrestle for it.

18:09.237 --> 18:10.445
This is crazy.

18:10.470 --> 18:13.740
They just need to do that
thing in Mr. Frond's dumb video.

18:13.808 --> 18:16.175
Yeah. You guys need
to try and look at it

18:16.200 --> 18:17.533
from each other's perspective.

18:17.558 --> 18:19.024
It's time to empathize, people.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.247
So it really wasn't
your fault, Laverne?

18:21.316 --> 18:23.883
No, and I guess it
wasn't your fault, either.

18:23.952 --> 18:27.420
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

18:30.725 --> 18:32.458
Oh, whoa.

18:32.527 --> 18:35.261
And, uh, this ends, like
all good dogfights do,

18:35.330 --> 18:37.196
with-with a good hard cry.

18:37.265 --> 18:39.465
So the Empathize Glide actually works.

18:39.534 --> 18:41.467
Maybe Mr. Frond is a genius?

18:41.536 --> 18:44.537
No, no, but he probably doesn't deserve

18:44.606 --> 18:46.472
to get destroyed by us.

18:46.541 --> 18:49.475
Kurt, we don't want you to
fly our revenge banner anymore.

18:49.544 --> 18:51.611
What? Oh, do... ? Oh, okay.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.379
Only problem is, it's already en route.

18:53.448 --> 18:55.815
See, I couldn't fly this
plane and tow the banner,

18:55.884 --> 18:57.545
so I called in a favor.

18:59.254 --> 19:01.587
Well, can't you just
radio him to turn around?

19:01.656 --> 19:03.489
He doesn't have his
radio on when he flies.

19:03.558 --> 19:05.438
He doesn't want the flight
tower yelling at him.

19:05.493 --> 19:06.959
Why would the tower yell at him?

19:07.028 --> 19:08.728
'Cause he doesn't have
his pilot's license.

19:08.797 --> 19:11.397
Oh, I'm flying.

19:11.466 --> 19:15.168
Kurt, that banner cannot fly
in front of that hotel, understand?

19:15.236 --> 19:16.669
What am I supposed to do?

19:16.738 --> 19:18.571
The Dice N' Slice.

19:18.640 --> 19:19.772
Well, how's that gonna help?

19:19.841 --> 19:21.774
Focus on the slicing part.

19:21.843 --> 19:24.012

Lot of puffy clouds out here.

19:37.325 --> 19:40.193
Holy crap! What the
hell is going on?! Aah!

19:40.261 --> 19:41.961
I thought we was friends.

19:42.030 --> 19:43.162
Huh.

19:43.231 --> 19:45.365
Your little problem has been sliced.

19:45.433 --> 19:47.166
- All right!
- Yay! -

19:47.235 --> 19:50.870
And we're at the halfway mark
of this totally normal air show.

19:50.939 --> 19:54.346
So, paper airplane contestants,
you are clear for takeoff.

19:54.371 --> 19:55.808
Okay, here we go.

19:55.844 --> 19:57.009
Good luck, Lin.

19:57.078 --> 19:58.644
- Oh... ow!
- Are you okay?

19:58.713 --> 20:00.313
I don't know. Something popped.

20:00.382 --> 20:02.181
Something popped?
I-In your throwing arm?

20:02.217 --> 20:03.883
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, my God.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.018
You overdid it with the
olive oil can, didn't you?

20:06.087 --> 20:07.887
Maybe.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.356
Ugh, I guess we weren't meant
to win the washing machine.

20:10.425 --> 20:12.825
- Bob, you shut your pretty mouth.
- Uh...

20:12.894 --> 20:15.161
Listen to me: you're
gonna throw the airplane.

20:15.230 --> 20:16.407
No, no, no, no, no.

20:16.431 --> 20:18.798
I'm the builder, you're the thrower.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.500
Geez, you guys are
kind of falling apart.

20:20.568 --> 20:23.328
Odds of Team Teddy are just
getting better by the...

20:23.353 --> 20:24.353
Ah, crap.

20:24.378 --> 20:26.005
Sorry, ma'am. Is your baby okay?

20:26.074 --> 20:27.840
Come on, Bobby. You might be a hooker,

20:27.909 --> 20:29.509
but you're a hooker
with a heart of gold.

20:29.544 --> 20:31.043
So what if you just push

20:31.079 --> 20:33.479
one of your wing-flappy
thingies down on one side?

20:33.548 --> 20:34.714
Yeah, that might work.

20:34.783 --> 20:36.149
All right.

20:36.217 --> 20:38.518
Here goes.

20:38.586 --> 20:41.354
Ooh. It's beautiful.

20:41.423 --> 20:42.989
We might actually win.

20:43.057 --> 20:45.324
And it just flew past 
the washing machine.

20:45.393 --> 20:48.027
- Damn it.
- And into the blender!

20:48.052 --> 20:49.885
We won a blender! Yes!

20:49.910 --> 20:51.408
- Ha, ha!

20:51.433 --> 20:53.032
Kids, we won a blender!

20:53.101 --> 20:54.545
- We're rich.
- Nice. There's so many things

20:54.569 --> 20:56.068
I've been wanting to blend.

20:56.104 --> 20:58.204
We've just been smushing
stuff with our hands.
