48:24.406 --> 48:26.440
if you want...

48:26.475 --> 48:28.275

49:54.525 --> 49:58.293
I have something I want to tell you.

49:58.328 --> 49:59.750
Hear me out.

49:59.786 --> 50:02.364
The other day we were talking
about taking a trip,

50:02.399 --> 50:09.002
and I was thinking, "Yeah, we could go
back and visit New York or Berlin."

50:09.038 --> 50:13.474
Then I started thinking, "Well,
let's not repeat ourselves.

50:13.509 --> 50:16.677
"Let's go someplace new. Let's go
someplace we've never been before,

50:16.712 --> 50:19.680
a place we can create
an entirely new memory."

50:19.715 --> 50:24.150
And then I realized, "Antarctica."

50:24.186 --> 50:26.052
I know. I know exactly
what you're thinking.

50:26.088 --> 50:27.720
We always said, "Never a cruise,"

50:27.755 --> 50:30.590
but they have ones you can take
through the Arctic Peninsula.

50:30.625 --> 50:33.960
They have lectures on sea life.
We could feed the penguins.

50:33.995 --> 50:36.096
You know I've always
wanted to feed a penguin.

50:36.131 --> 50:37.964
Honestly, the time to go is now.

50:37.999 --> 50:40.399
It's melting, and soon
enough it'll be gone,

50:40.434 --> 50:41.833
so what do you think?

50:42.555 --> 50:44.275
Sounds expensive.

50:45.172 --> 50:49.641
You'd have to stop taking $900
out of the ATM every month.

50:49.676 --> 50:51.910
- What are you talking about?
- Our bank statements.

50:51.945 --> 50:56.280
I've noticed that you withdraw
$300 out of our checking account

50:56.316 --> 50:58.247
at least three times a month.

50:58.884 --> 51:00.118
What's that for?

51:00.153 --> 51:02.386
Just cash to have on hand.

51:02.422 --> 51:03.887
Nothing specific.

51:03.923 --> 51:05.256
Really?

51:07.026 --> 51:08.692
Because it's never 200.

51:10.330 --> 51:11.929
It's never 500.

51:11.964 --> 51:14.797
It's always exactly... three.

51:15.700 --> 51:18.668
That seems oddly specific, Simon.

51:25.377 --> 51:26.443
Oh.

51:27.412 --> 51:28.512
I, uh...

51:29.448 --> 51:30.846
Oh fuck.

51:32.583 --> 51:33.715
Okay.

I'm... I'm sorry.

Oh God.

51:47.031 --> 51:47.962
Wow.

51:47.997 --> 51:51.166
You know, I thought...

51:52.402 --> 51:56.003
It's stupid, but... but for a
second there I thought...

51:56.039 --> 51:57.305
"Here it comes.

51:58.542 --> 51:59.907
"Here comes the story...

52:00.843 --> 52:02.177
the lie."

52:14.756 --> 52:16.490
It's a prostitute, Greg!

Well, she's not really
a prostitute. She's...

52:19.662 --> 52:24.797

in the glove compartment.
