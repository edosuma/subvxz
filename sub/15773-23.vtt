00:09.560 --> 00:11.240
Am I good? Is it clear?

00:12.640 --> 00:13.600
I can't tell.

00:13.800 --> 00:14.800
I'm clear.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.332
not clear.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.835
- Oh! What's that idiot doing
in my blind spot?

00:19.903 --> 00:21.737
Everyone's in your blind spot.

00:21.804 --> 00:23.805
This car is
nothing but blind spots.

00:23.873 --> 00:26.642
- It's not a car.
It's a parade float.

00:26.709 --> 00:29.645
Now am I clear?

00:29.712 --> 00:32.714
- I don't know.
All I see is a giant foot.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.584
- It's not a giant foot.
It's a giant flipper.

00:35.652 --> 00:37.719
That's it.
I'm going for it.

00:49.766 --> 00:53.135
- Great. Now we have
to go to the car wash.

00:53.203 --> 00:55.204
- Oh, no.
I'm getting out here.

00:55.271 --> 00:56.672
What are you, crazy?

00:56.739 --> 00:59.741
You're on the side
of a freeway! It's dangerous!

00:59.809 --> 01:01.810
- Not as dangerous as
riding in that thing.

01:01.878 --> 01:03.812
Suit yourself.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.188
Am I clear?

01:13.256 --> 01:14.957
I'm going for it!

Look!

01:47.924 --> 01:49.791
There goes our car.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.860
Is that a parade float?

01:51.928 --> 01:54.096
It's not a parade float.

01:54.163 --> 01:57.399
It's my parade float.

01:59.535 --> 02:01.470
- Is it made
out of paper mâché?

02:01.537 --> 02:04.206
Papier-mâché, yes.

02:04.274 --> 02:05.707
- What will happen
when it gets wet?

02:05.775 --> 02:08.276
It's going to get wet?

02:18.154 --> 02:20.889
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!

02:20.957 --> 02:22.924
Turn off the water!

02:37.440 --> 02:41.243
Turn off the water!
Turn off the water!

02:49.085 --> 02:51.119
Aah! Eek! Ooh!

03:48.945 --> 03:51.747
My eye! My eye!

03:51.814 --> 03:54.249
Oh, my eye!
- Daffy? Don't move!

03:54.317 --> 03:56.718
I'm getting the first aid kit!
- Oh, no!

03:59.455 --> 04:00.856
Let me see your eye!

04:00.923 --> 04:02.858
It's all that's left--

04:02.925 --> 04:06.628
My beautiful parade float
is gone!

04:06.696 --> 04:10.532
We--we never even got to be
in a parade!

04:14.637 --> 04:16.071
You going to be ok?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.540
He'll be ok.

04:18.608 --> 04:20.976
Probably just needs
a little time.

05:00.249 --> 05:02.918
Maybe that's enough time.

05:04.687 --> 05:06.555
Daffy?

05:06.622 --> 05:09.191
Bugs! I knew it!

05:09.258 --> 05:11.793
I knew
you'd come through for me.

05:11.861 --> 05:14.463
I knew if I stayed
in here long enough

05:14.530 --> 05:16.364
And sobbed loud enough,

05:16.432 --> 05:18.700
You'd make me
another parade float.

05:18.768 --> 05:21.570
It wasn't easy. There were
days when I wanted to give up,

05:21.637 --> 05:24.072
When I wanted to come out of
my room, maybe take a shower.

05:24.140 --> 05:27.142
But I persevered.
I stayed in my room,

05:27.210 --> 05:29.044
And I sobbed even louder,

05:29.111 --> 05:32.881
Because I knew that you needed
that time and that motivation,

05:32.949 --> 05:36.985
And I was right.
Thank you, brother.

05:37.053 --> 05:40.155
So, where is it? Where's my
new, beautiful parade float?

05:40.223 --> 05:42.390
- I didn't make you
a parade float.

05:53.769 --> 05:56.872
- I'm fine.
I'm disappointed, but I'm fine.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.674
- Why can't you just drive
a normal car?

05:59.742 --> 06:02.777
- Normal cars are
for normal people.

06:02.845 --> 06:04.246
I'm not normal!

06:04.313 --> 06:05.847
I'll give you that.

06:05.915 --> 06:07.782
You're my best friend.

06:07.850 --> 06:10.151
You know me better than anyone.

06:10.219 --> 06:12.921
You see
what a horrible person I am.

06:12.989 --> 06:15.690
That's why I have
to drive a parade float--

06:15.758 --> 06:19.461
To distract the rest of
the world from seeing it!

06:19.529 --> 06:22.697
- You're going to need something
better than a parade float.

06:22.765 --> 06:25.467
Better than a parade float?

06:25.535 --> 06:28.537
Better than a parade float...

06:30.773 --> 06:32.374
I'll take it.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.082
Not since my parade float

06:40.149 --> 06:46.121
Have I felt that a vehicle
so expressed my essence.

06:46.189 --> 06:47.489
How much?

06:47.557 --> 06:49.124
375,000.

06:49.192 --> 06:51.793
- Dollars?
- Yes.

06:51.861 --> 06:55.931
American dollars?

06:55.998 --> 06:59.601
- I'm not giving you $375,000
for a yacht.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.203
But you're my best friend.

07:01.270 --> 07:03.004
That's what best friends do.

07:03.072 --> 07:05.407
No, they don't.

07:07.510 --> 07:11.847
- Fair enough.
Will you give me $375,000,

07:11.914 --> 07:15.484
Which I will donate
to the charity of my choice?

07:17.019 --> 07:21.456
- Daffy, no one's going
to give you $375,000.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.993
- of course
I'll give you $375,000.

07:25.061 --> 07:26.695
- I knew I could count on you,
Porky.

07:26.763 --> 07:30.198
- You poor thing. I didn't
even know you were sick.

07:30.266 --> 07:31.833
But when's the operation?

07:31.901 --> 07:33.969
- Tonight,
so let's wrap this up.

07:34.036 --> 07:36.538
- Can I ask why you didn't go
to Bugs for the money?

07:36.606 --> 07:38.807
- Because
you're my best friend.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.777
I know that
I can ask you for anything,

07:41.844 --> 07:45.380
Just as you know that
you can ask me for anything.

07:47.583 --> 07:49.117
- Could you turn on
that lamp for me?

07:49.185 --> 07:51.019
I can't see the combination.

07:52.355 --> 07:53.922
Do it yourself.

08:00.596 --> 08:02.597
Here you go.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.810
This is only $350,000.

08:14.877 --> 08:16.578
But it's all I have.

08:16.646 --> 08:20.081
- Porky, you are making this
very hard for me.

08:20.149 --> 08:23.885
Do you think I like having to
come to my best friend for money?

08:23.953 --> 08:26.555
Can you imagine
what this is like for me,

08:26.622 --> 08:29.090
How awkward this is?

08:29.158 --> 08:31.726
What's that
in the back of the safe?

08:31.794 --> 08:34.929
A gold watch?

08:34.996 --> 08:37.631
- But that was
my great-grandfather's.

08:37.700 --> 08:41.403
- "randall pig"?
It's engraved?

08:41.470 --> 08:43.638
That's going to kill
its resale value.

08:43.706 --> 08:45.006
I'm going to need
more than this.

08:45.074 --> 08:46.107
Give me your debit card.

08:46.175 --> 08:48.109
- But that's the money
I live on.

08:48.177 --> 08:50.178
- Porky, I can't sit here
and argue with you.

08:50.246 --> 08:52.147
The surgery's, like,
in 10 minutes.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.749
- You're right.
Take the debit card.

08:54.817 --> 08:57.752
"take the debit card" what?

08:57.820 --> 09:00.689
- Take the debit card,
please?

09:00.756 --> 09:04.659
- Fine. As a favor to you,
I'll take the debit card.

09:04.727 --> 09:08.330
What is this, wool? All right.
I guess I'll take the coat, too.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.605
Maybe I can get
a couple of bits for this.

09:16.672 --> 09:18.273
feel better!

09:18.341 --> 09:21.743
Wait a second.
Now, how am I going to live?

09:24.614 --> 09:26.414
Whoo-hoo!

09:26.482 --> 09:30.952
I'm free!
I've never felt so alive!

09:31.020 --> 09:34.422
The high seas,
the wind in my hair,

09:34.490 --> 09:36.658
The salt on my skin!

09:36.726 --> 09:38.760
I am a sailor!

09:38.828 --> 09:41.296
I am sailing!

09:41.364 --> 09:45.734
What an unbelievable rush!
Whoo-hoo!

09:56.312 --> 09:57.846
Porky?

09:57.914 --> 09:59.180
What are you doing?

09:59.248 --> 10:02.350
Eating garbage.

10:02.418 --> 10:04.452
- Is that something
you've always done,

10:04.520 --> 10:06.421
Or is that a new thing?

10:06.489 --> 10:09.024
- Are you going
to finish that?

10:13.696 --> 10:16.331
- I tried calling you, but
your phone's been disconnected.

10:16.399 --> 10:19.367
Why is it so dark in here,
and cold?

10:19.435 --> 10:21.636
- I couldn't pay my bills.
- Why not?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.405
I gave all my money to Daffy.

10:23.472 --> 10:25.774
- Why would you give
all your money to Daffy?

10:25.841 --> 10:29.344
- For his kidney transplant.
Do you know how he's doing?

10:29.412 --> 10:32.013
Let's go find out.

10:38.020 --> 10:39.921
Ahh.

10:39.989 --> 10:43.825
I should have bought a yacht
with Porky's money years ago.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.595
Nice boat.

10:47.663 --> 10:49.230
- She's a real beauty,
isn't she?

10:49.298 --> 10:51.599
The Queen of the Ocean.
That's why I named her that.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.636
A fitting name for the successor
to my parade float.

10:54.704 --> 10:57.973
Which,y the way, which was
also named "Queen of the Ocean."

10:58.040 --> 11:00.709
- How's the kidney?
- Kidney?

11:00.776 --> 11:03.645
Oh, I just told Porky that so he'd
give me the money for the yacht.

11:18.127 --> 11:20.061

13:42.679 --> 13:44.613
- that you bought
with my money!

13:45.949 --> 13:47.449
Aah!

13:47.517 --> 13:50.085
How could you lie to me?

13:50.153 --> 13:52.922
- I'm sorry. I thought if I
told you what the money was for,

13:52.989 --> 13:54.390
You wouldn't give it to me.

13:54.457 --> 13:56.492
I wouldn't have!

13:56.560 --> 13:58.561
You just proved my point.

13:58.628 --> 14:00.729
How am I the bad guy here?

14:07.170 --> 14:10.172
Ok. I've had enough.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.007
Well, maybe just one more.

14:15.345 --> 14:16.745
All right. Break it up.

14:17.914 --> 14:19.248
- Here's what
we're going to do.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.950
Daffy, you're going
to sell this thing

14:21.017 --> 14:22.585
And give Porky
his money back.

14:22.652 --> 14:25.721
- Are you crazy?
I already lost my parade float!

14:25.789 --> 14:27.690
I'm not about
to lose my yacht.

14:32.829 --> 14:34.930
- Well, you're about
to lose a friend.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.333
- Yeah, but those are easy
to get when you have a yacht.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.002
Uh, guys?

14:40.937 --> 14:42.237
Where's the dock?

14:42.305 --> 14:44.773
But that's impossible.

14:44.841 --> 14:46.342
I tied a shank knot
to this cleat,

14:46.409 --> 14:48.277
Tied a sheepshead knot here,

14:48.345 --> 14:50.112
A double rolling hitch here,

14:50.180 --> 14:52.448
A simple,
yet elegant bow here.

14:52.515 --> 14:54.717
And a square knot here.
- Uh-huh.

14:54.784 --> 14:57.219
And what kind of knot
did you tie to the dock?

15:09.699 --> 15:11.734
what are we going to do?

15:11.801 --> 15:14.803
We're stranded
in the middle of the ocean!

15:14.871 --> 15:18.307
I always knew
I'd die this way!

15:18.375 --> 15:20.242
- All right.
Let's not panic.

15:20.310 --> 15:24.013
We'll just put up the sail
and sail back.

15:28.051 --> 15:29.618
Where's the sail?

15:29.686 --> 15:31.553
I didn't get one.

15:31.621 --> 15:32.721
What?

15:32.789 --> 15:33.956
I didn't have enough money.

15:34.024 --> 15:36.225
I was forced to choose
between a sail

15:36.292 --> 15:37.826
And this jacuzzi.

15:37.894 --> 15:40.062
So if anyone's to blame,
it's Porky.

15:40.130 --> 15:43.899
- I gave you everything I had.
I'm completely broke!

15:43.967 --> 15:47.036
- The fact that you're not more
financially successful is not my fault.

15:48.972 --> 15:52.141
- What? Is it me?
It's him, right?

15:52.208 --> 15:54.910
- We'll just radio
the coast guard for help.

15:54.978 --> 15:56.912
- Nope. No radio.
- What?

15:56.980 --> 15:58.347
There wasn't enough money,

15:58.415 --> 16:00.349
Not after I got
the second jacuzzi.

16:02.018 --> 16:03.385
I have an idea.

16:03.453 --> 16:06.455
Let's all take a long, hot soak
in the jacuzzi.

16:06.523 --> 16:09.091
It will relax us,
which will allow us

16:09.159 --> 16:12.294
To think of a way
out of our predicament.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.297
I'll take the master jacuzzi.
You two take that one.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.736
Ha. Ah! Ooh!

16:20.804 --> 16:22.938
Ahh. Ahh.

16:26.710 --> 16:30.079
I think I have our answer.

16:30.146 --> 16:32.614
Porky should swim back
and get help.

16:32.682 --> 16:34.249
Off you go, Porky.
- Hey, what are you doing?

16:34.317 --> 16:35.984
Stop! What do you think
you're doing?

16:36.052 --> 16:38.187
No one's swimming anywhere.

16:38.254 --> 16:39.988
We're sailing back.

16:42.726 --> 16:44.026
Where'd you get a sail?

16:44.094 --> 16:45.728
It's your bedsheets.

16:45.795 --> 16:49.531
- What? Those are 1,500
thread count egyptian cotton!

16:51.134 --> 16:54.536
Do you know
how much these sheets cost?

16:54.604 --> 16:56.205
More than lifejackets!

16:56.272 --> 16:58.974
That's why there are
no lifejackets on board!

16:59.042 --> 17:01.376
Well, that, and they make you
look stupid.

17:05.682 --> 17:07.148
Aah!

17:12.122 --> 17:15.924
- He's unconscious!
What should we do?

17:28.772 --> 17:31.340
- Psst. Porky.
Untie me.

17:31.407 --> 17:34.710
- I can't.
I'm under direct orders not to.

17:34.778 --> 17:38.013
- You know, Porky, being out
here in the middle of the ocean

17:38.081 --> 17:41.150
Has really made me
reevaluate some things.

17:41.217 --> 17:44.953
I see now that it's not money
or things that matter.

17:45.021 --> 17:48.023
It's friends--
best friends.

17:48.091 --> 17:52.327
And you, Porky Pig,
you are my best friend.

17:52.395 --> 17:54.229
Do you really mean it?

17:54.297 --> 17:56.965
Have you ever known me to lie?

17:57.033 --> 18:00.602
- Yes. You lied about
needing a kidney transplant.

18:00.670 --> 18:02.204
That's in the past.

18:02.272 --> 18:04.540
Now, please, untie me

18:04.607 --> 18:09.178
So I can give my best friend
a great big hug.

18:09.245 --> 18:11.880
You won't regret this.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.385
now, go swim and get help.

18:16.452 --> 18:18.520
Aah!

18:18.588 --> 18:20.789
Porky!

18:24.360 --> 18:26.829
- Well,
I guess it's just me now,

18:26.896 --> 18:29.064
All alone on a yacht,

18:29.132 --> 18:31.333
Stranded in
the middle of the ocean

18:31.401 --> 18:36.171
With no lifejackets
and no idea how to sail.

18:36.239 --> 18:39.174
Bugs! Porky!
Wait for me!

18:39.242 --> 18:41.777
hmm.

18:41.845 --> 18:44.613
These are coming with me.

18:44.681 --> 18:47.950
Mmm. It's like being caressed
by an angel.

18:51.654 --> 18:55.724
I regret nothing!

18:55.792 --> 19:00.429
Except not buying
those life jackets!

19:01.965 --> 19:03.866
It was a dream.

19:03.933 --> 19:05.734
It was all a dream.

19:05.802 --> 19:08.904
That explains why
I was such a horrible person

19:08.972 --> 19:11.273
And did
all those horrible things.

19:11.341 --> 19:13.575
Ehh...Not a dream.

19:13.643 --> 19:15.277
You are a horrible person,

19:15.345 --> 19:17.312
And you did do
those horrible things.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.047
Then what happened?

19:19.115 --> 19:20.782
- We were picked up
by a passing ship.

19:20.850 --> 19:23.252
You nearly drowned
in your stupid bedsheets.

19:23.319 --> 19:25.821
- What about "The Queen of
the Ocean"? Did she survive?

19:25.889 --> 19:28.056
- Yeah.
It was towed back to shore.

19:28.124 --> 19:30.759
oh, thank goodness!

19:30.827 --> 19:34.863
It is things that matter!
This proves it!

19:34.931 --> 19:37.232
- We sold it
and got Porky's money back.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.268
Ohh!

19:39.335 --> 19:42.037
- I have good news
and bad news.

19:42.105 --> 19:46.508
The good news is there's no
complications from the near drowning.

19:46.576 --> 19:49.244
The bad news is
we ran some tests,

19:49.312 --> 19:52.948
And it looks like
you're going to need...

19:53.016 --> 19:55.150
A kidney transplant.

19:55.218 --> 19:58.754
- Huh. Ironic. How much
does one of those cost?

19:58.821 --> 20:02.324
I don't know.
About $375,000.

20:02.392 --> 20:04.793
But I'm sure
you have insurance.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.267
Well, I may not have
insurance,

20:12.335 --> 20:14.903
But at least
I have a best friend.

20:17.573 --> 20:20.142
Right, Bugs and/or Porky?

20:26.082 --> 20:28.817
- I see you've decided
to rebuild your parade float.

20:28.885 --> 20:31.653
- Well, I couldn't ask
my best friend to do it,

20:31.721 --> 20:33.922
Not after you paid
for my kidney transplant.

20:33.990 --> 20:36.091
Don't mention it.

20:36.159 --> 20:39.628
Shame they couldn't also
throw in a brain transplant.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.029
I won't forget this!

20:41.097 --> 20:43.598
It was a tremendous act
of generosity,

20:43.666 --> 20:45.767
And I shall forever be
in your debt.

20:45.835 --> 20:47.936
- uh, Daffy,
can I take a break?

20:48.004 --> 20:50.939
I'm still not feeling 100%
since the surgery.

20:51.007 --> 20:53.208
Oh, here we go.

20:53.276 --> 20:56.445
How many times are you going
to throw it in my face

20:56.512 --> 20:58.880
That you gave me
your kidney?

20:58.948 --> 21:01.183
You still have
the other one!

21:01.250 --> 21:03.418
- I got to get
a new best friend.
