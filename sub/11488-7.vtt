00:06.729 --> 00:07.963
Hello?

00:08.029 --> 00:09.030
Hold on.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.630
Are you in for Suzanne?

00:12.796 --> 00:15.163
I kinda have to be.

00:15.230 --> 00:17.863
You didn't put your hand
over the phone.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.729
Oh, right.

00:20.796 --> 00:22.530
Sorry, he's not here.

00:24.096 --> 00:25.796
Gimme, gimme.

00:25.863 --> 00:28.263
Sorry about that.
My brother's kid.

00:28.330 --> 00:30.763
Yeah, dumb as a stump.

00:30.829 --> 00:33.063
(doorbell rings)

00:35.930 --> 00:37.463
Hi.

00:41.096 --> 00:44.430
I'm not sure I have
the right address.

00:44.497 --> 00:46.497
No, you got
the right address.

00:49.163 --> 00:51.096
Charlie, it's for you!

00:52.330 --> 00:54.597
Who is it?

00:54.664 --> 00:58.664
Karma.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.030
What?

01:00.096 --> 01:02.930
ur chickens have
come home to roost.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.664
Chickens? Karma?

01:05.729 --> 01:07.863
Alan, what the hell
are you talking...

01:08.863 --> 01:11.230
Ew...

01:11.297 --> 01:14.463
Charlie,
it's for you!

01:42.409 --> 01:43.609
o? Hey...

01:43.676 --> 01:45.509
great to see you...

01:45.576 --> 01:47.743
again.

01:47.810 --> 01:50.543
I don't think we've met.

01:50.609 --> 01:51.975
Really?

01:52.042 --> 01:53.176
Really.

01:53.242 --> 01:54.875
Are you trying
to give me a stroke?

01:54.942 --> 01:56.676
Is that what
you're trying to do?

01:56.743 --> 01:58.710
Well, it's about time.

01:58.776 --> 02:00.142
Oh, hey, Mom.

02:00.209 --> 02:01.776
I got the cleaning stuff
you wanted.

02:02.942 --> 02:04.343
Well, don't just
stand there.

02:04.409 --> 02:05.975
Get in the kitchen
and start using it.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.609
Fine.

02:07.676 --> 02:09.309
Berta, aren't you
going to introduce us?

02:09.376 --> 02:10.376
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:10.443 --> 02:11.476
Where are my manners?

02:11.543 --> 02:13.810
Charlie, Alan,

02:13.875 --> 02:16.409
I'd like you to meet
my youngest daughter Naomi--

02:16.476 --> 02:18.609
the lighof my life.

02:18.676 --> 02:20.875
A little angel
who swooped down from heaven

02:20.942 --> 02:23.509
and landed on
a married man's penis.

02:24.476 --> 02:26.009
Mom!

02:26.076 --> 02:27.909
And when she got knocked up
and lost her job,

02:27.975 --> 02:29.776
she had to come live with me.

02:29.842 --> 02:31.209
They fired you
for being pregnant?

02:31.276 --> 02:32.609
Yep. Being pregnant

02:32.676 --> 02:35.676
and stealing a few
office supplies.

02:35.743 --> 02:39.376
Eight computers
and a Xerox machine.

02:39.443 --> 02:41.409
Not all at once.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.700
So which one of you guys

02:44.309 --> 02:46.509
is the rich one
who likes to party?

02:49.309 --> 02:50.643
Get to work.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.643
All right.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.576
And when you're done
in the kitchen,

02:54.643 --> 02:56.409
you can scrub the toilets.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.875
All right!

02:57.942 --> 03:00.409
If she spent more time
on her knees than on her back,

03:00.476 --> 03:02.543
she wouldn't be
in this situation.

03:03.409 --> 03:05.409
Not necessarily.

03:07.576 --> 03:09.975
Should she really be scrubbing
toilets in her condition?

03:10.042 --> 03:11.710
Hey, when I was pregnant
with her

03:11.776 --> 03:13.343
I worked right up
until my water broke.

03:13.409 --> 03:15.476
And then I used the water
to mop the floor.

03:17.343 --> 03:20.309
I exaggerate for effect.

03:23.142 --> 03:24.509
Wow.

03:24.576 --> 03:27.543
Yeah, and we think
our family's screwed-up.

03:27.609 --> 03:32.810
No, no, I meant,
"Wow, Naomi is hot."

03:32.875 --> 03:35.076
What?

03:35.142 --> 03:37.309
Come on.
She's ripe and luscious.

03:37.376 --> 03:41.076
I just want to caress
that taut, voluptuous belly

03:41.142 --> 03:43.209
and, you know...

03:45.076 --> 03:47.810
Ungh...

03:48.909 --> 03:51.009
Who are you?

03:51.076 --> 03:53.343
Oh, come on, you can't tell me
you don't appreciate

03:53.409 --> 03:55.476
the beauty of a woman
in that condition.

03:55.543 --> 03:58.776
Okay, look, freako.

03:58.842 --> 04:01.409
I get the aesthetic appeal

04:01.476 --> 04:03.076
of a woman with
the glow of motherhood,

04:03.142 --> 04:06.609
a new life growing inside
of her, blah, blah, blah.

04:06.676 --> 04:07.842
But long story short--

04:07.909 --> 04:09.276
once there's a bun
in the oven,

04:09.343 --> 04:11.942
I don't feel the need
to butter it.

04:12.009 --> 04:14.142
Well, then you
have missed out

04:14.209 --> 04:16.841
on one of the great sexual
experiences a man can have.

04:16.909 --> 04:18.942
There had to be one.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.009
When Judith was pregnant
with Jake,

04:22.076 --> 04:23.676
I-I don't know
if it was hormones

04:23.743 --> 04:27.276
or pheromones, but she just
could not get enough of me.

04:27.343 --> 04:29.576
And ever since then, every time
I see a pregnant woman,

04:29.643 --> 04:30.875
I just...

04:30.942 --> 04:33.242
(moans)

04:33.309 --> 04:36.443
Okay, seriously,
you got to stop that.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.076
I am telling you,
it was nine months

04:38.142 --> 04:39.609
of the hottest sex
we've ever had,

04:39.676 --> 04:41.842
even with the morning ckness
and hemorrhoids.

04:42.942 --> 04:44.576
Maybe that explains
Jake's grades.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.609
Morning sickness
and hemorrhoids?

04:47.676 --> 04:51.242
No, the repeated blows
to his unformed head.

04:54.743 --> 04:56.376
You are such an idiot.

04:56.443 --> 04:58.209
All the experts agree
that sex during pregnancy

04:58.276 --> 04:59.576
is not harmful
to the baby.

04:59.643 --> 05:02.109
Experts, shmexperts.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.842
Tonight when you're sleeping,
I'm gonna come in

05:03.909 --> 05:06.176
and start poking you
in the ear with a hot dog.

05:08.209 --> 05:10.443
See how you like it.

05:10.509 --> 05:13.042
Okay, okay, clearly,
we have different opinions.

05:13.109 --> 05:15.142
All I know is,
I find pregnant women

05:15.209 --> 05:18.276
very erotic.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.900
?

05:26.608 --> 05:28.708
* Men *

05:32.374 --> 05:34.508
(moans)

05:35.541 --> 05:36.975
Excuse me?

05:37.042 --> 05:39.975
Oh, 's just
a little indigestion.

05:40.042 --> 05:44.008
So, uh, she's got you doing
a little ironing, huh?

05:44.074 --> 05:46.274
Yeah. Boy, I can't wait
to get this day over with

05:46.341 --> 05:48.241
and take a nice, hot bath.

05:48.308 --> 05:50.042
(moans)

05:55.408 --> 05:57.174
You know, uh,

05:57.241 --> 05:59.641
we happen to have a Jacuzzi tub.

05:59.708 --> 06:01.042
It, uh, has those jets and...

06:04.741 --> 06:05.942
I'm okay.

06:06.008 --> 06:07.141
I'm okay.

06:07.207 --> 06:08.008
(laughing):
Are you sure?

06:08.074 --> 06:09.741
Yeah, yeah, fine.

06:09.808 --> 06:11.608
You, uh, you want me
to run some water for you?

06:11.675 --> 06:12.608
No, no, I couldn't.

06:12.675 --> 06:14.074
I got to keep working

06:14.141 --> 06:16.274
or my mom'll be all
over me like hair on soap.

06:18.308 --> 06:21.474
Mm, you, uh,
you do paint a picture.

06:21.541 --> 06:24.408
But still, you, you shouldn't
be working in your condition.

06:24.474 --> 06:26.675
Come on, just, uh,
just sit here.

06:26.741 --> 06:28.308
I'll, uh,
I'll finish it for you.

06:28.374 --> 06:29.308
Really?

06:29.374 --> 06:30.575
Yes, really.

06:30.641 --> 06:31.908
Why, thank you.

06:31.975 --> 06:32.975
(both laugh)

06:35.675 --> 06:38.141
You're not doing
a very good job anyway.

06:41.174 --> 06:42.341
Ooh.

06:42.408 --> 06:43.541
Hot.

06:46.207 --> 06:47.641
So, you know what the baby is?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.775
Well, I'm hoping
for human.

06:52.808 --> 06:54.474
Uh, no, no, I meant boy or girl?

06:54.541 --> 06:55.474
Oh, it's a girl.

06:55.508 --> 06:56.775
Oh, oh, that's nice.

06:56.841 --> 06:58.241
I always wanted a girl.

06:58.308 --> 07:00.608
I mean, you know, I love my son,
but let's face it,

07:00.675 --> 07:03.207
girls are so much smarter
and more spiritual than boys.

07:03.274 --> 07:06.308
Plus, we got all the boobies.

07:07.408 --> 07:09.608
All the good ones anyway.

07:09.675 --> 07:13.675
Courseright now, mine feel
like two big bags of wet sand.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.374
Nice.

07:16.441 --> 07:18.975
My back is killing me,
my feet are swollen,

07:19.042 --> 07:21.808
and I'm passing gas
like a NASCAR pit crew.

07:24.808 --> 07:27.374
Well, I-I think you look...
beautiful.

07:28.408 --> 07:29.775
Aren't you sweet?

07:31.008 --> 07:32.608
Ooh. God, it feels

07:32.675 --> 07:34.341
like she's playing
Hacky Sack in there.

07:34.408 --> 07:36.207
Wanna feel?
Yes.

07:41.207 --> 07:42.274
Come on.

07:47.174 --> 07:49.074
What's going on here?

07:49.141 --> 07:50.408
Oh, hi, Berta.

07:50.474 --> 07:52.042
The baby was kicking
and Naomi asked me

07:52.107 --> 07:53.641
if I wanted to feel the baby
kicking and I said, "Sure,"

07:53.708 --> 07:55.174
which is when you walked in,
and that's pretty much it.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.741
Okay.
Yes, it is okay.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.374
It is okay.

07:58.441 --> 08:01.042
Hey, you're having
a new granddaughter.

08:01.107 --> 08:02.575
W-What a blessing, huh?

08:02.641 --> 08:04.741
Yeah, sort of takes
the sting out of this one

08:04.808 --> 08:08.008
being a gullible tramp.

08:08.074 --> 08:10.575
Now, get off your rump roast
and finish the ironing.

08:10.641 --> 08:12.708
Oh, wait, relax, Berta,
I'll do the ironing.

08:12.775 --> 08:15.042
Why don't you just let Naomi
take it easy?

08:15.107 --> 08:17.808
Easy's the reason
e's in this condition.

08:18.841 --> 08:20.708
Get to it.
All right.

08:22.808 --> 08:24.908
You know, if, if your back
is really bothering you,

08:24.975 --> 08:26.841
I'm a chiropractor...
Zippy!

08:26.908 --> 08:28.241
Yes?
Conference.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.308
Yes.

08:31.908 --> 08:35.541
Zippy is kind of
an affectionate nickname...

08:35.607 --> 08:37.541
'cause I'm quick.

08:40.207 --> 08:41.741
What are you doing?

08:41.808 --> 08:43.575
I'm trying to teach
that girl responsibility.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.608
She's going to be a single
mother with no job skills.

08:46.675 --> 08:49.341
I want her to be able to support
herself with some dignity.

08:49.408 --> 08:51.608
Oh, please, what kind of
dignity can a woman have

08:51.675 --> 08:53.908
ironing clothes and
cleaning strangers' toilets?

08:56.408 --> 08:58.908
I'll tell you what kind.

08:58.975 --> 09:01.641
The dignity of an honest buck
for an honest day's labor.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.341
off to the
working gal.
Excuse me.

09:07.908 --> 09:10.042
* Men *

09:13.141 --> 09:15.641
(sobbing)

09:15.708 --> 09:17.508
(sniffling)

09:17.575 --> 09:19.675
Berta?
Go away.

09:19.741 --> 09:24.207
Uh, I actually need
to use the bathroom.

09:24.274 --> 09:26.341
Well, I'm using this one.

09:26.408 --> 09:27.441
Are you okay?

09:27.508 --> 09:30.241
Yeah, Chlie,
I am just aces.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.374
All right, uh...

09:32.441 --> 09:34.474
Would you like a magazine?

09:34.541 --> 09:36.308
Go... away.

09:38.975 --> 09:40.241
(sniffles)

09:40.308 --> 09:42.808
Berta, I'm coming in.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.374
Is it okay if I come in?

09:49.541 --> 09:50.808
Hi.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.141
(sniffling)

09:52.207 --> 09:54.408
I didn't want you
to see me like this.

09:54.474 --> 09:55.675
Yeah, well, it's better

09:55.741 --> 09:57.875
than the image
I had in my mind.

09:58.908 --> 10:00.808
What's wrong?

10:00.875 --> 10:02.875
What do you think?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.408
Your daughter?

10:05.474 --> 10:07.608
I had such hopes for her.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.575
Of all of my girls,
she was the smart one.

10:10.641 --> 10:13.942
She was the smart one?

10:14.008 --> 10:16.408
Go on.

10:16.474 --> 10:17.908
I really thought

10:17.975 --> 10:19.975
Naomi would make something
of herself, you know?

10:20.042 --> 10:21.474
A career, a family.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.608
A house that wasn't just
a horse trailer

10:23.675 --> 10:25.741
with a futon in it.

10:25.808 --> 10:27.207
Don't blame yourself.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.775
It's not your fault.

10:28.841 --> 10:32.441
Who said anything about
being my fault, you nimrod?

10:32.508 --> 10:34.074
No, no, no, no, no.

10:34.141 --> 10:36.541
I'm-I'm just saying that-that
you did the best you could.

10:36.608 --> 10:38.808
How the hell do you know?

10:38.875 --> 10:41.675
Actually, I-I don't.

10:41.741 --> 10:46.808
But I am something of an expert
on where girls go wrong.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.942
When-When they start
sleeping around,

10:49.008 --> 10:51.474
it-it's usually a daddy thing.

10:51.541 --> 10:54.008
At least in my experience.

10:54.074 --> 10:56.174
Thanks for trying
to cheer me up, Charlie.

10:56.241 --> 10:57.174
You're welcome.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.441
But you can stop now,

10:58.508 --> 10:59.708
'cause it ain't your forte.

10:59.775 --> 11:01.241
Okay.

11:01.308 --> 11:03.741
I'll tell you whose fault it is.

11:03.808 --> 11:05.274
Ronald Wiedermeier.

11:05.341 --> 11:06.541
Who?

11:06.608 --> 11:09.107
The sleazeball
who pollinated my little flower

11:09.174 --> 11:12.608
then disappeared like cupcakes
at a pot party.

11:12.675 --> 11:14.508
Damn that
Ronald Niedermeier.

11:14.575 --> 11:15.775
Wiedermeier.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.341
Him, too.

11:17.408 --> 11:19.841
Well, I'll tell ya, I am not
gonna let him get away with it.

11:19.908 --> 11:21.107
Good for you.

11:21.174 --> 11:22.741
Guys like that need to know

11:22.808 --> 11:24.308
that there's consequences
to their actions.

11:24.374 --> 11:26.841
They need to learn that-that
women are people with feelings.

11:26.908 --> 11:29.008
They're not just vaginas
that talk.

11:29.074 --> 11:31.374
"Vaginas that talk"?

11:31.441 --> 11:35.074
Damn that Ronald Wiedermeier.

11:35.141 --> 11:36.641
You know, Charlie,
you may be a pig,

11:36.708 --> 11:37.808
but in this case, you're right.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.008
Thank you.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.608
What did I say?

11:40.675 --> 11:43.141
We need to teach
Mr. Wiedermeier a lesson.

11:43.207 --> 11:44.975
I don't think
I said that.

11:45.042 --> 11:46.274
Come on.

11:46.341 --> 11:47.875
No, really, I-I am
almost positive

11:47.942 --> 11:50.107
I didn't say that.

11:53.141 --> 11:55.741
You know, I still
have to pee.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.049
Where the hell are we?

12:05.116 --> 12:07.449
It's called Rancho Pacoima.

12:07.516 --> 12:09.516
Huh.

12:09.583 --> 12:12.416
It's very... brown.

12:12.483 --> 12:16.683
Yeah, not much grows here
except meth labs and cold sores.

12:18.316 --> 12:19.616
Just out of curiosity,

12:19.683 --> 12:21.416
what exactly are we hoping
to accomplish

12:21.483 --> 12:22.950
here with this Ronald guy?

12:23.017 --> 12:25.116
Well, in the perfect world,
he'd dump his wife

12:25.182 --> 12:26.416
and marry my little hose bag.

12:26.483 --> 12:29.082
But I'll settle
for him stepping up

12:29.149 --> 12:30.483
and paying
for his mistake.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.216
And if he declines?

12:32.283 --> 12:33.583
That's why I brought you.

12:33.650 --> 12:35.116
Me?

12:35.182 --> 12:37.883
All I can do at this point
is pee on his rug.

12:37.950 --> 12:40.082
You still have to go?

12:40.149 --> 12:43.283
Well, yeah,
it doesn't evaporate.

12:43.349 --> 12:45.383
Can we pull over for a minute?

12:45.449 --> 12:47.316
In this neighborhood
in a Mercedes?

12:47.383 --> 12:51.082
Sure, if you're partial
to car theft and sodomy.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.316
Take a left right here.

12:54.383 --> 12:55.816
That's not a road.

12:55.883 --> 12:57.950
Well, not during
rainy season.

13:02.483 --> 13:04.516
(thud)

13:04.583 --> 13:05.416
Oh, God!

13:05.483 --> 13:07.716
I think I hit a dog!

13:07.783 --> 13:09.716
Don't worry.
It was just a rat.

13:09.783 --> 13:11.383
It's okay.
He's getting up.

13:15.283 --> 13:17.850
* Men. *

13:17.917 --> 13:21.283
(giggles)

13:21.349 --> 13:22.650
What's this stuff
called again?

13:22.716 --> 13:24.816
Vitamin E oil.
Oh.

13:24.883 --> 13:27.049
Feels really good.

13:27.116 --> 13:28.616
Ah...

13:34.449 --> 13:36.449
(doorbell rings)

13:38.283 --> 13:40.082
Hey, Mom. I'm
ready to go.

13:40.149 --> 13:41.349
Where's your father?

13:41.416 --> 13:43.349
He's in the den
rubbing oil on Naomi.

13:43.416 --> 13:46.216
Who's Naomi?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.616
Berta's daughter.

13:47.683 --> 13:49.850
Your father's rubbing oil
on a woman in front of you?

13:49.917 --> 13:51.383
Nah. I couldn't watch.

13:51.449 --> 13:53.216
It was too creepy.

13:53.283 --> 13:55.316
Well, we'll just see
about that.

13:55.383 --> 13:57.750
Oh, and by the way, I found out
why I get bad grades.

13:57.816 --> 13:59.416
It's all your fault.

13:59.483 --> 14:01.983
Why is it my fault?

14:02.049 --> 14:04.883
You know.

14:04.950 --> 14:06.983
NAOMI:
Oh, yeah, Alan.

14:07.049 --> 14:08.249
ALAN:
Ah...

14:08.316 --> 14:10.616
Wait in the car.

14:12.383 --> 14:14.283
Alan, what do you think
you're doing?

14:14.349 --> 14:15.516
Oh, hi, Judith.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.182
Naomi here w worried
about stretch marks,

14:17.249 --> 14:18.616
and I was showing her how
vitamin E can help prevent them.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.082
You know, like I did with you.

14:20.149 --> 14:21.483
And then you walked in,
and that's pretty much it.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.850
Oh, really?

14:22.917 --> 14:24.683
Yeah. Hey, why don't you pull up
your top

14:24.750 --> 14:26.683
and let her check out
your belly?

14:26.750 --> 14:28.316
I will not!

14:28.383 --> 14:30.216
So he rubbed this
on you, too?

14:30.283 --> 14:31.650
Oh, he rubbed all right,

14:31.716 --> 14:33.750
but it was only to satisfy
his own twisted needs.

14:33.816 --> 14:36.850
Excuse me, but you were the one
that was constantly horny.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.683
And you sure took advantage
of it, didn't you?

14:38.750 --> 14:41.583
Hey, when the bar is only open
nine months a decade,

14:41.650 --> 14:43.349
you drink till you puke.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.249
And then you keep drinking.

14:46.316 --> 14:47.783
(Jake laughs)

14:47.850 --> 14:49.349
That's funny.

14:49.416 --> 14:53.182
Hey, buddy.

14:53.249 --> 14:57.616
You're turning into
quite the little
ninja, aren't you?

14:57.683 --> 14:59.716
There's just one thing
I don't understand.

14:59.783 --> 15:01.283
Well, wha-what's
that, honey?

15:01.349 --> 15:03.383
If you have sex
with a pregnant lady,

15:03.449 --> 15:04.550
wouldn't she have twins?

15:04.616 --> 15:06.049
No.

15:06.116 --> 15:09.049
Otherwise, I'd be having
a whole damn litter.

15:11.082 --> 15:13.017
* Men. *

15:13.082 --> 15:15.583
(dogs barking)

15:19.416 --> 15:22.017
Lot of cold medicine.

15:22.082 --> 15:24.082
He must have allergies
or something.

15:24.149 --> 15:26.583
<i>You don't watch 60Minutes,
do you?</i>

15:32.983 --> 15:35.149
(bumping and thudding)

15:36.583 --> 15:38.516
What?

15:38.583 --> 15:40.049
You Ronald?

15:42.116 --> 15:43.111
No.

15:43.112 --> 15:44.945
WOMAN:
Ronald,
who is it?

15:45.012 --> 15:49.446
Damn it, Darlene.
We're incognito, remember?

15:50.479 --> 15:52.112
You cops?

15:52.179 --> 15:53.379
Yeah.

15:53.446 --> 15:55.745
I'm Scully.
This is Mulder.

15:56.909 --> 15:59.110
Listen, can I use
your bathroom?

15:59.175 --> 16:02.943
No, no, it's, uh, not
functioning... correctly.

16:03.010 --> 16:05.110
We use the Chevron
up the block.

16:05.175 --> 16:06.309
Bye.

16:06.376 --> 16:08.476
No bye-bye.

16:08.542 --> 16:09.809
So, Ronald, this
is the deal.

16:09.876 --> 16:11.409
You've knocked up
my little girl,

16:11.476 --> 16:13.476
and I want to know what
you're gonna do about it.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.843
Well, that depends.

16:14.909 --> 16:16.043
On what?

16:16.110 --> 16:17.709
Who's your little girl?

16:17.776 --> 16:19.110
Naomi.

16:19.175 --> 16:20.476
Naomi?

16:20.542 --> 16:24.110
Oh, I haven't seen Naomi
in a real long time.

16:24.175 --> 16:26.275
About eight,
nine months?

16:26.342 --> 16:29.010
Yeah, that sounds right.

16:29.076 --> 16:30.731
Ew.

16:30.732 --> 16:32.098
DARLENE:
Ronald, what's
going on?

16:32.164 --> 16:34.064
Nothing,
sweet cheeks.

16:34.662 --> 16:35.996
Okay, look,

16:36.063 --> 16:38.396
I'd like to keep this
away from the missus.

16:38.463 --> 16:39.962
She's a little volatile.

16:40.029 --> 16:43.496
Hasn't slept really well.

16:43.562 --> 16:45.263
Maybe you've got a coffee can
or a milk jug?

16:45.329 --> 16:46.695
I could just
go around back?

16:46.762 --> 16:48.996
No, no, it's a real mess
back there.

16:49.063 --> 16:50.296
(explosive pop)

16:50.363 --> 16:52.562
Ooh!

16:52.629 --> 16:57.496
Damn it, Darlene. I told you
not to smoke in there.

16:57.562 --> 17:02.163
Well, I don't have
to pee anymore.

17:04.729 --> 17:06.896
* Men. *

17:06.962 --> 17:08.628
Oh!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.029
That feels so good.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.128
(breaks wind)

17:16.829 --> 17:18.029
Sorry.

17:18.096 --> 17:19.530
Oh, no, don't be silly.

17:19.595 --> 17:21.561
It's a... It's a natural
bodily function.
Oh.

17:21.628 --> 17:24.363
The, uh, the baby is-is pressing
down on the intestines and...

17:24.430 --> 17:26.496
Oh, dear Lord!

17:27.862 --> 17:29.263
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:29.329 --> 17:31.430
Oh, no, no.
No, it's-it's all right.
Okay.

17:31.496 --> 17:32.862
Uh, I'm used to it.

17:32.929 --> 17:34.496
When my wife was pregnant...

17:34.595 --> 17:36.862
Oh, that's got
some hang time.

17:38.329 --> 17:42.363
You are so sweet, Alan.

17:42.430 --> 17:44.662
How come I've never
met a man like you?

17:44.729 --> 17:47.229
Well, speaking on behalf
of men like me,

17:47.296 --> 17:49.595
we don't get out a lot.

17:54.396 --> 17:55.796
(breaks wind)

17:58.430 --> 17:59.829
Sorry.

17:59.896 --> 18:03.396
I'm not.

18:08.729 --> 18:11.862
You know, these sweatpants
are really comfortable.

18:11.929 --> 18:13.463
That's 'cause they're dry.

18:14.496 --> 18:15.929
And boy, what a deal.

18:15.996 --> 18:17.695
What did you call
that place again?

18:17.762 --> 18:18.862
A swap meet.

18:18.929 --> 18:21.796
Swap meet.

18:23.430 --> 18:26.862
Well, aside from the exploding
meth lab and peeing myself,

18:26.929 --> 18:28.463
this was a fun
little trip.

18:28.530 --> 18:31.595
I got the sweatpants
and a bag of tube socks,

18:31.662 --> 18:35.263
four DVDs and a corn dog,
all for eight bucks.

18:35.329 --> 18:36.595
Just a hint.

18:36.662 --> 18:38.862
The corn dog will last longer
than the socks.

18:38.929 --> 18:40.595
NAOMI:
Oh, God! Oh!

18:40.662 --> 18:42.063
Oh, it's
too big!

18:42.129 --> 18:43.962
What the hell?

18:44.029 --> 18:46.096
Alan, you sick freak.

18:47.129 --> 18:48.962
Naomi!

18:49.029 --> 18:51.463
Oh, hi. She's
having a baby.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.129
BERTA:
Oh, damn!

18:53.196 --> 18:55.063
It's all right, honey.
Mommy's here.

18:55.129 --> 18:56.296
(Naomi moaning)

18:56.363 --> 18:57.629
Ooh...

18:57.695 --> 18:59.762
What? You never saw
an angry one before?

18:59.829 --> 19:01.129
Out of the
way, Zippy.

19:01.196 --> 19:03.595
It's okay.
I'm a chiropractor.

19:03.662 --> 19:06.263
(screaming and sobbing)

19:06.329 --> 19:07.562
You got it.

19:08.496 --> 19:09.962
It's okay, honey.
That's it, yeah.

19:10.029 --> 19:12.063
Now take a big deep breath
and push!

19:12.129 --> 19:13.762
Yeah, whoa, whoa,
hold on! hold on!

19:13.829 --> 19:16.662
Let me put down
some t

19:16.729 --> 19:19.063
Breathe.

19:19.129 --> 19:21.396
Breathe. Now, push!

19:21.463 --> 19:23.396
(pained groaning
and crying)

19:26.829 --> 19:27.463
Push!

19:27.530 --> 19:28.829
(screaming)

19:29.244 --> 19:31.489
**NE

19:33.080 --> 19:34.947
Now, you listen up,
Brittany Pam,

19:35.013 --> 19:37.114
you're my last chance.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.780
You're gonna go to college,

19:38.847 --> 19:40.913
and you're gonna make something
of yourself.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.414
No getting knocked up

19:42.481 --> 19:45.913
by some greasy tweer
from Rancho Pacoima.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.901
Oh, gee, Mom, about that.

19:47.966 --> 19:50.200
I've-I've kind of been
counting back the weeks,

19:50.267 --> 19:52.901
and Ronald can't be the daddy.

19:52.966 --> 19:54.200
What?

19:54.267 --> 19:57.133
Yeah. See, he was in a burn unit
at the time.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.700
He wanted to, but his skin
just kept sliding off.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.933
Oh, God.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.333
Here comes
the corn dog.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.434
So... so, who is the father?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.000
Well, I got it narrowed down.

20:09.066 --> 20:10.467
Hmm. Dear Lord.

20:10.534 --> 20:14.634
I'll know for sure
if she starts speaking Spanish.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.933
Well, we just
shut down Ronald for $5,000.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.500
"We"?

20:21.567 --> 20:23.767
You were hiding behind the car,
pulling off your wet undies.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.734
Oh, make yourself
comfortable.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.434
The doctor will
be right in.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.467
(moaning)

20:31.534 --> 20:34.966
Come on, freako.

20:35.033 --> 20:38.133
You are absolutely radiant.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.534
Best of luck.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.767
Thanks.
Sorry about
your couch.

20:44.834 --> 20:48.100
Good news, honey:
I got you $4,000.
