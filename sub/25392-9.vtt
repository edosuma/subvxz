01:31.300 --> 01:32.801
You sure nobody followed us?

01:32.884 --> 01:36.263
What do I look like
if I can't lose a tail? Come on.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.140
Why don't you bust
through the glass?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.558
Because I have the code.

01:40.142 --> 01:43.603
No way a billionaire
knows a jailbird like you.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.523
Will you please just let
the brother concentrate?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.525
Ah, <i>voilÃ .</i>

01:49.401 --> 01:50.819
Think they'll find the car?

01:50.902 --> 01:53.030
I think we are safe for now.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.615
I'm gonna go and secure the back.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.033
What is this place?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.201
A pharmaceutical research facility.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.288
Relax, it's empty.
Doesn't actually open for another month.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.498
- We're safe.
- How is it you know Danny Rand?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.667
Hot yoga.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.211
Carl, I've got service tomorrow. I gotta...

02:08.294 --> 02:09.670
Not after that shoot-out, Dad.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.424
Bushmaster has a bounty
on everybody's head in this building.

02:12.507 --> 02:16.511
I think what your daddy's trying to ask
is what the plan is, hero.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.722
- To survive the night.
- Okay.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.974
Too many entry points.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.394
I still think we would have been safer
back at the precinct.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.147
You must have lost part of your brain
with that arm.

02:27.230 --> 02:32.069
Your Harlem cops would jump to claim a mil
for taking me down.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.404
Shit, I'm surprised
you ain't tried to collect.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.366
- The night's still young.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.076
Don't wander far, baby.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.661
I am grown, Mother.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.456
Hey, Carl, I'd like to do a prayer circle.

02:44.539 --> 02:49.211
Uh-oh. Here come Jesus.
"I am blessed and highly favored."

02:49.294 --> 02:51.630
- "God is good."
- "All the time."

02:51.713 --> 02:54.466
Now, shut up, Mariah. Show some respect.

03:04.017 --> 03:09.940
O Lord, we are not perfect.
Nor are we innocent.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.235
But we pray to you, dear Father God,

03:13.318 --> 03:16.113
to protect us from those
who would do us harm.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.614
From without.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.533
And within.

03:19.616 --> 03:21.827
You are our hope.

03:22.994 --> 03:26.331
And in Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.666
Amen.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.628
Why are you looking up?

03:32.295 --> 03:36.425
I'm looking for a lightning bolt.
I just prayed with the devil.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.911
What's going on? Hmm?

04:04.995 --> 04:07.205
Luke Cage, he was strong.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.544
What about the little birdie
who owns the shop, huh? Hmm?

04:13.545 --> 04:17.298
Hey. She might still have some here.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.216
Hmm?

04:20.218 --> 04:21.219
It's gone.

04:22.137 --> 04:26.141
It's gone! All the nightshade!
She took it all!

04:27.392 --> 04:30.145
Hear me now! Up the bounty!

04:30.228 --> 04:31.938
Three million each!

04:32.856 --> 04:36.860
Mariah Stokes and her child!
I want them alive!

04:49.080 --> 04:50.123
Can I help?

04:51.291 --> 04:55.754
Ha. Been 30 years since I thumped
anything harder than a Bible.

04:55.837 --> 05:00.550
But you know somethin'?
It felt good.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.518
Okay. Okay.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.813
This might sting a little.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.398
Ahh, you are not wrong, nurse.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.902
Doctor, actually.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.195
Doctor.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.323
And I'm more than happy to help.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.660
Your son saved my life more than once.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.453
Bulletproof.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.834
Tossing grown men around like rag dolls.
It's unnatural.

05:35.544 --> 05:39.756
But majestic. Maybe magical.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.925
Yeah, well...

05:42.801 --> 05:46.721
they say that magic might just be
science that we haven't figured out yet.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.724
Ah. Hmm.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.687
So, uh, a little calendula
for the healing.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.399
Um, some lavender for the pain...

05:58.024 --> 06:00.819
and a very rare strain of...
<i>Atropa belladonna.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:04.155
"The beautiful lady."

06:05.490 --> 06:06.491
Yes.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.202
Nightshade.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.414
Now, that's poisonous, isn't it?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.499
No, no, not in small amounts.

06:15.458 --> 06:20.171
Healers have been using it for centuries
to prevent and heal.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.174
To relieve pain and...

06:23.258 --> 06:27.804
increase white blood cell count
and, um, cure disease.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.645
Maybe... maybe more.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.147
Hey, hey...

06:39.774 --> 06:43.987
It's okay to be scared.
It has been a long night.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.701
But I think
we're gonna get through it safely.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.330
I have faith in my son.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.877
No!

06:59.919 --> 07:01.421
No!

07:01.504 --> 07:03.214
Wish I could say the same for my mother.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.425
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

07:06.134 --> 07:12.349
Hell no, Knight!
I will never feed a pig anything but slop!

07:12.432 --> 07:17.228
If you go on record
that Bushmaster burned down your home,

07:17.312 --> 07:20.440
we can have him locked up in an hour.
This could all be over.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.816
No!

07:21.900 --> 07:26.071
You are broke, burnt out,
your crew is scattered to the wind,

07:26.154 --> 07:30.033
and you almost got your daughter killed.
It's over.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.328
Your family started it. You finish it.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.665
Come clean, Mariah.
Help Misty lock him up.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.877
Could you even keep him?

07:40.961 --> 07:44.089
Y'all cops couldn't even keep
Luke behind bars

07:44.172 --> 07:46.925
and Bushmaster whipped his ass
twice already.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.346
You sold Bushmaster Hammer weapons.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.141
Each gun has a mandatory
federal weapons charge attached to it.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.185
If he goes down, you go with him.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.648
He's got leverage on you,
unless you start talking.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.444
Lady, I am the only reason
you're not a chimichanga.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.364
Return the favor. Help me help you.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.332
Immunity.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.335
What?

08:22.419 --> 08:27.048
You want me to talk?
I want total immunity on the guns.

08:27.132 --> 08:31.553
And I don't plead shit.
I skate like Debi Thomas.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.731
Never ever.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.319
Your friend doesn't seem too sure.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.909
You know, there's no way they're ever
gonna include Shades in on that deal.

08:54.993 --> 08:55.994
Luke.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.623
Hernan can take care of himself.
Get it done.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.591
Give me your phone. Now!

09:13.928 --> 09:17.223
You can charge it
on your way to the barn, heifer.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.394
You know what? That smoke inhalation
must have damaged your brain.

09:21.478 --> 09:25.065
- Badge or not, I will whup your old ass!
- Misty!

09:27.942 --> 09:31.863
<i>Of all people,
how can you be considering this?</i>

09:31.946 --> 09:33.782
She put your ass back in jail!

09:33.865 --> 09:35.825
This is the last thing I wanted.

09:35.909 --> 09:40.288
She might not have pulled the trigger
on Ridenhour, but she is responsible!

09:40.371 --> 09:42.540
And what about Candace? Huh?

09:42.624 --> 09:46.920
Look, we have got Mariah
right where we want her, okay?

09:47.003 --> 09:50.882
She is out of options.
One more tip, and she topples.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.344
Bushmaster will scorch Harlem
and anyone in his way to get to her.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.639
It's bigger than just her now,
and we both know it.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.142
What about you? Hmm?

10:01.226 --> 10:02.602
Why can't you testify?

10:02.685 --> 10:05.647
You have been at the front row
of all this since it started.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.566
Your eyes have to be worth something.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.986
Black. Vigilante. Ex-con.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.948
Doesn't play well in court.
Even though I was exonerated.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.492
The black negates everything else.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.995
Not to mention, Mariah may as well
be Adam Clayton Powell.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.457
Creating reasonable doubt
is what she does best.

10:26.209 --> 10:28.044
A deal gets her on the stand.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.046
We can't do this, okay?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.632
We can't do this!

10:32.715 --> 10:35.176
We can only handle one devil at a time.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.845
We make the deal,

10:36.928 --> 10:40.181
she takes down Bushmaster for the guns
and for the brownstone assault.

10:40.265 --> 10:45.645
And then... then, if we're lucky,
we get her on something else.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.022
Like Ridenhour's murder.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.155
Look, we can take
door number one, two or three.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.239
Guess what?

10:57.615 --> 11:00.451
All the prizes suck.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.510
Are you okay? Are they okay?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.512
Yeah. They're fine for now.

11:20.305 --> 11:23.016
This place seems... focused.

11:23.099 --> 11:28.187
The brass is back in charge.
You're a worker bee again, I guess.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.440
Yeah? Who'd they send? Streiber?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.401
No. Me.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.988
Deputy Chief.
Your new job looks good on you.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.408
Yeah, well, I've been better.
Tom was a close friend.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.701
So where have you been?

11:41.784 --> 11:44.287
I assume you were in the middle
of the attack at Mother's Touch?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.872
Gallivanting with your boyfriend again?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.374
There you go. Again.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.338
Chief, can we talk, please? Privately?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.299
Like you have a choice.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.814
You like watching women while they sleep?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.610
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

12:18.905 --> 12:23.868
You're not half the protector
you claim to be, Luke Cage.

12:25.203 --> 12:29.999
Well, I do my best and you do your worst.
What can I say?

12:31.751 --> 12:35.296
I've done more for Harlem
than you ever have. Or will.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.384
Harlem doesn't honor you, Mariah.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.804
It somehow survives you.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.895
Which is more than I can say for Cornell.

12:57.485 --> 13:00.405
Harlem doesn't turn on me,
because it loves me.

13:01.030 --> 13:05.243
It fights for me. It would die for me.

13:06.327 --> 13:10.790
See... I elevate Harlem.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.875
You?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.922
You're nothing but an overseer.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.555
Harlem doesn't need a hero.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.725
It needs a queen.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.875
All right, what does she want?
Reduced time?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.628
Immunity.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.547
For the gun sale
that she made with Bushmaster.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.758
They exchanged Hammer weapons.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.509
She can put 'em all in jail.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.138
It is the smart play.

14:07.221 --> 14:10.683
Put Bushmaster behind bars,
get Mariah comfortable,

14:10.767 --> 14:14.270
and then get her ass on something
not covered in the deal.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.857
I'll call DA Tower.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.404
- Mercedes?
- Yeah?

14:23.488 --> 14:27.617
You're playing the game at a higher level.
You've grown.

14:29.452 --> 14:33.122
Yeah, well, you can't be the only sister
'round here upgrading.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.794
Who else knows about this plan?

14:38.669 --> 14:42.131
Luke Cage, you, Mariah and me.

14:42.215 --> 14:47.053
All right, well, let's leave it that way
until I can get an answer from the DA.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.516
<i>Two cups of cocoa coming up.</i>

15:18.251 --> 15:19.252
Carl. Carl.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.047
Carl, now, there's a time for power,

15:23.131 --> 15:26.551
and sometimes a lighter touch.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.514
Huh.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.605
I guess I'm a little out of practice.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.274
There we go.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.027
- You know, I executive produced this?
- Oh. Yeah.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.176
Your strength is from God, Carl.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.970
I have no doubt in my mind about that.

16:12.597 --> 16:17.101
But with that kind of power
comes its share of pain.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.437
I know, Dad.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.649
I work really hard to pull back.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.486
Even though sometimes
I have to smack a fool to get things done.

16:26.569 --> 16:30.281
Now, see, that right there,
that guilt you carry...

16:30.823 --> 16:33.618
the weight of that responsibility,
it's a burden.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.954
I understand it. Believe me, I understand.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.706
I'm dealing.

16:39.832 --> 16:44.128
It hasn't been easy since, uh,
since Claire...

16:45.046 --> 16:49.175
Claire? The young woman
who visited me at the church?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.177
What happened?

16:52.178 --> 16:55.056
It's a long story.

16:55.139 --> 16:59.143
Boy, when you find someone
who's gonna make room for you on the door

16:59.227 --> 17:02.063
when the ship goes down,
that's a rose you cultivate.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.525
There you go again with that movie.
It's been years. Let it go, man.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.068
I can't let it go.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.362
I can't let it go.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.574
See, what it is...
and, hell, I know this...

17:13.657 --> 17:17.203
when you are stressed,
you push people away.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.997
I do the same thing.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.501
I'm not a good example.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.711
But here's the thing.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.257
When you have a calling,

17:29.340 --> 17:31.592
sometimes you need to heal yourself

17:31.676 --> 17:35.054
just as much as the person
who you're trying to heal.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.223
You gotta take care of yourself,

17:37.306 --> 17:40.601
or else the whole world
is gonna fall apart.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.146
How's the hand?

17:44.230 --> 17:46.315
It's just some cuts and bruises.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.985
That little gal healed me.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.070
She worked them roots.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.573
- Roots?
- Mmm-hmm.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.116
How exactly did she do that?

17:55.199 --> 17:58.035
"The Beautiful Lady." Nightshade.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.247
She reached into that magic bag of hers
and worked them roots.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.457
I didn't ask too many questions.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.378
It's not the first time
she worked her magic.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.506
Maybe there's a science to it.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.008
Science?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.884
Magic?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.386
God?

18:15.845 --> 18:18.472
That power flows from within.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.850
From inside.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.437
What comes out
when that pressure is heaviest?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.189
That's the real magic.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.360
That's what defines being a man.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.323
That's what defines being a hero.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.972
Never seen DA Tower come through
with paperwork so quickly.

19:00.806 --> 19:01.974
It's simple.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.312
Mariah goes on record about McIver,

19:06.395 --> 19:10.316
we won't move on any of her gun smuggling
or other related charges.

19:16.781 --> 19:20.034
You know, I had an awful argument
with Captain Ridenhour

19:20.117 --> 19:21.869
before he was murdered.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.454
He wanted to make a deal with Mariah,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.999
and I lit into his integrity
in ways that were...

19:28.334 --> 19:29.543
unbecoming.

19:31.545 --> 19:35.675
All he wanted to offer her
was a reduced sentence.

19:35.758 --> 19:38.552
This is immunity.

19:42.973 --> 19:47.061
You know, I learned a lot of lessons from
Tommy Ridenhour over the years, Misty.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.772
Some harder than others.

19:49.855 --> 19:54.527
But the most important one...
was that you can't stop the tide.

19:56.153 --> 20:00.324
You can only try and save as many people
as you can from the flood.

20:00.408 --> 20:05.705
And this Bushmaster
has brought a river of blood with him.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
It's got to end.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.009
I've got Mariah stashed
at a Rand facility in Queens.

20:19.093 --> 20:23.139
I can get her and get her back here
in less than an hour.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.269
This is the right play.

20:29.812 --> 20:30.980
Do it quickly.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.307
My father's hand.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.435
You healed him.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.191
He said it was like magic.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.277
It was just a simple salve I made.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.489
I was a conventional doctor
for a few years, but...

21:22.198 --> 21:23.824
there were so many people I couldn't help,

21:23.908 --> 21:27.411
I decided to be like my dad
and just go my own way.

21:27.495 --> 21:28.496
Your dad?

21:30.664 --> 21:31.916
Jackson Dillard.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.960
He died before I was born.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.670
Helping campesinos.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.256
That's why I did Doctors Without Borders.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.467
To be just like my daddy.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.261
Being in the middle of nowhere,

21:44.345 --> 21:47.264
I just became fascinated
with holistic medicine, and...

21:48.390 --> 21:50.518
Mother Earth's unfiltered power.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.856
So I melded together ancient
and modern medical practice into...

21:55.940 --> 21:57.149
Mother's Touch.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.110
Mother Nature's Touch.

22:02.279 --> 22:06.992
Natural remedies
for headaches, anxiety, infertility...

22:07.076 --> 22:08.744
Why did Bushmaster come to you?

22:12.748 --> 22:14.792
He really spooked me.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.169
The items, they were so bizarre.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.671
Bizarre how?

22:18.754 --> 22:19.755
Arcane.

22:20.381 --> 22:23.717
It wasn't until after he attacked you
that I tried to see

22:23.801 --> 22:27.972
if he possibly enhanced himself
with some of the items that I sold him.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.393
Which is why you asked
where my strength came from

22:32.476 --> 22:34.478
the first time I came to your shop.

22:35.938 --> 22:36.939
Yeah.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.735
Some old world practices,
they use a flower called nightshade.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.362
Heavily in some of their rituals.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.740
Lauding to power
and to a closeness to the gods.

22:48.784 --> 22:52.204
If I could just have access to him
and to his blood work...

22:52.830 --> 22:54.832
I could see what it is
that's affecting him.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.458
And then you could stop him?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.507
I'm sorry, I don't know.

23:06.260 --> 23:08.929
I helped build this monster,
and I don't know.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.433
I don't even know
if I can help bring him down.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.519
Look, let me worry about that.
Just tell me what you know.

23:15.603 --> 23:18.147
- I don't know much.
- Every little bit helps.

23:18.772 --> 23:19.773
It does.

23:21.775 --> 23:22.943
Okay, sure.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.615
But on one condition.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.577
Tell me the truth.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.331
Everything you know about my mother.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.383
The nightshade was never intended
for you to use this way.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.678
Your body is falling apart.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.015
Your mind will follow.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.852
Your soul is the last to go.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.271
I just need a little nightshade.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.107
To finish.

24:03.692 --> 24:04.902
Please, Uncle.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.820
No.

24:09.323 --> 24:10.407
I can't.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.085
The word is out.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.421
Three million a head for Mariah and Tilda.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.299
And still no bite?

24:29.259 --> 24:32.096
I could find Tupac alive for that.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.099
What about your other task?

24:37.726 --> 24:40.688
Production's gonna take some time. Hmm?

24:40.771 --> 24:46.527
The infrared lamp, the soil...
It's totally different than ganja.

24:46.610 --> 24:47.611
Fix it.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.155
I need it.

25:03.627 --> 25:07.631
Don't play with the weapons!

25:29.319 --> 25:30.571
Mariah Dillard.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.365
I know exactly where she is.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.368
Is that offer still good?

25:36.452 --> 25:38.454
Mariah Stokes.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.582
And, yes, it is.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.752
Anything out there?

25:45.836 --> 25:48.756
Rats. Big ones.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.633
Always hungry.

25:55.846 --> 25:57.139
I recognize you.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.143
From the news.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.024
It was from your Family First initiative.

26:07.941 --> 26:09.026
Oh.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.196
You sure were trying to do
a whole lot of good,

26:12.279 --> 26:14.865
even though you paid for it with bad.

26:17.993 --> 26:22.456
- It already seems like a lifetime ago.
- Hmm.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.752
I can't even keep my own family together.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.086
Hmm.

26:28.170 --> 26:31.298
Kids, they ain't easy.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.845
I wasn't there for Tilda
when she was growing up.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.351
I thought I could make up for...

26:45.687 --> 26:46.939
lost time.

26:49.691 --> 26:55.697
I was there for Carl growing,
but I wasn't really there.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.868
You do the best you can.

27:05.374 --> 27:09.711
It's hard to imagine Luke Cage in diapers.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.466
- You got any pictures?
- Of course.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.262
Yeah. Look at that big-headed boy.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.643
Oh!

27:26.061 --> 27:29.398
Oh, you try to capture the good.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.402
Keeps you from remembering all the bad.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.905
I made a whole ton of mistakes with Carl.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.871
You just don't know what you're doing...

27:45.998 --> 27:47.958
- Until you do it.
- Mmm.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.753
But you love 'em as hard as you can.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.634
And you pray that they can figure it out
for themselves once the time comes.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.179
Your daughter...

28:02.264 --> 28:08.353
is a brave, intelligent, forceful,
dynamic woman.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.524
She got that from some place.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.195
With that kind of insight,

28:17.279 --> 28:21.658
I may have to catch a sermon or two
at that church of yours.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.954
All are welcome, sister. All are welcome.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.201
Another Red Stripe?

29:06.286 --> 29:07.454
If you don't mind.

29:21.885 --> 29:22.886
Shit!

29:25.097 --> 29:27.724
Who were you just trying to call?

29:28.642 --> 29:29.768
Shades.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.561
Wow.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.647
Was that actually the truth for once?

29:33.730 --> 29:36.817
Today is not the day, Matilda.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.530
Well, when is the day?
When is the day when all is revealed?

29:42.281 --> 29:47.160
When there's no more heads on spikes,
no more running, no more surprises?

29:47.244 --> 29:48.829
Uh, surprises?

29:48.912 --> 29:51.748
You have the nerve
to talk to me about surprises?

29:52.708 --> 29:56.586
Yeah, most of your clients
are from the islands.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.381
You could have set up shop in Brooklyn
and done fine.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.591
But you chose Harlem. Why?

30:03.635 --> 30:04.636
To surprise me?

30:05.762 --> 30:08.348
I came because I wanted to be home.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.101
And with Cornell gone...

30:11.184 --> 30:16.148
You thought he was the last Stokes
and the curse would end.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.151
I made the same mistake.

30:22.195 --> 30:27.909
Dillard would remain,
and all would be right with the world.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.954
You are the one obsessed
with Dillard, Mommy.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.416
Dillard is a fantasy.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.669
Stokes is real.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.089
Our blood is burden.

30:43.467 --> 30:47.137
A lot of people had to die
to make this family what it is.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.268
I get it.

30:54.644 --> 30:58.732
The Dillards are Creole and light-skinned.
The good ones with the good hair.

31:00.025 --> 31:03.445
And the Stokes are dark like delta mud.

31:04.488 --> 31:05.989
Violent and complicated.

31:08.325 --> 31:10.243
That's why you always hated yourself.

31:13.080 --> 31:17.501
You think I hate the Stokes
'cause I'm colorstruck?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.836
You don't know shit.

31:20.420 --> 31:24.424
I know that I have always been
a disappointment to you.

31:26.093 --> 31:28.678
I know that you've always tried
to keep me away.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.723
You brought me joy.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.562
And my deepest shame.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.274
Why? Because I'm not the doctor
my daddy was?

31:41.358 --> 31:45.529
Or is it because his light skin
and green eyes somehow skipped me?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.491
That man was not your father.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.582
I did love him.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.043
Hard.

32:03.046 --> 32:08.760
In the ways a straight woman
could love a gay man.

32:10.554 --> 32:12.431
Yeah, he came from money.

32:13.557 --> 32:18.854
They were so happy he wasn't gay,
they didn't care how black my ass was.

32:20.981 --> 32:24.901
That's how bad the idea
of a gay son was to them.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.697
They didn't care I already had a kid.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.867
They'd make any lie work.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.912
So the whole thing about Howard,

32:36.705 --> 32:39.166
and everything that you told me
about how he died...

32:39.249 --> 32:40.333
That was all true.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.463
I loved him.

32:46.006 --> 32:48.967
His death was tragic.

32:50.427 --> 32:55.348
And I kept the Dillard name alive
by playing the widow.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.394
What's one more lie?

33:01.271 --> 33:03.106
The gayness evaporated.

33:05.025 --> 33:11.323
It also gave you a good daddy
and a hell of a role model.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.327
Luke Cage was right.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.788
You can't be trusted.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.503
I am a survivor, dear heart.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.674
That why you killed Cornell?

33:31.301 --> 33:34.095
- Is that what Luke Cage told you?
- Is it true?

33:41.144 --> 33:42.312
Yeah.

33:43.897 --> 33:44.898
Yes.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.321
Luke Cage was the one
that started the dominoes falling.

33:51.404 --> 33:53.823
Fort Knox. Scarfe.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.661
Cornell lost his mind trying to kill Cage.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.913
I never asked for any of this shit!

33:59.996 --> 34:02.082
But you killed Cornell.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.875
Cage didn't have anything to do with that!

34:03.959 --> 34:06.127
You killed Cornell!

34:06.211 --> 34:07.963
Why did you kill Cornell?

34:08.045 --> 34:12.634
Because! He loved Uncle Pete
more than he loved me!

34:12.717 --> 34:16.429
What the hell does Uncle Pete
have to do with anything?

34:22.476 --> 34:23.645
Everything.

34:31.110 --> 34:36.074
Our Uncle Pete
could suck the oxygen out of a room.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.327
So electric.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.998
The way he dressed.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.083
The way he played guitar.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.170
His swag.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.844
Kids used to make fun of me
'cause I was dark.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.683
Said I looked like a African.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.603
"Black Mariah!"

35:16.281 --> 35:19.242
Pete was the only one
that told me I was beautiful.

35:22.287 --> 35:26.041
He reminded me how smart I was.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.005
I loved him.

35:39.387 --> 35:43.266
Until he started sneaking
into my room at night.

35:45.435 --> 35:47.020
I didn't want it.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.401
I never wanted it.

36:04.079 --> 36:05.955
"Family first.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.918
Always."

36:12.462 --> 36:16.174
When Mabel knew? "No abortions!"

36:19.260 --> 36:23.973
The second you were born,
the Johnsons would raise you.

36:24.057 --> 36:26.184
You were already with them.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.064
I was already engaged to Jackson...

36:33.942 --> 36:35.819
when Cornell killed Pete.

36:37.153 --> 36:40.657
Mabel had her first stroke
when you were three.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.246
As she withered, her influence waned.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.583
So, eventually,
I was able to get you back.

36:53.837 --> 36:55.839
That night in the club...

36:57.716 --> 36:59.718
in our Paradise...

37:02.137 --> 37:04.556
Cornell taunted me.

37:05.682 --> 37:08.393
He said I wanted it!

37:19.946 --> 37:22.574
So I smacked him
in the head with a bottle,

37:22.657 --> 37:25.285
I pushed his ass out the window

37:25.368 --> 37:30.039
and bashed his face in with a mic stand,

37:30.123 --> 37:32.625
because he was wrong.

37:37.797 --> 37:40.425
I never wanted it.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.476
And I never wanted you.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.820
I tried to love you.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.908
I tried.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.038
But I don't.

38:13.500 --> 38:14.709
That's the truth.

38:18.588 --> 38:22.801
'Cause every time I look in your face...

38:25.386 --> 38:26.763
I see Pete.

38:33.228 --> 38:34.437
I'm sorry.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.528
You're a monster.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.159
You're a monster!

39:16.104 --> 39:18.606
You got what you wanted.
Sign the damn thing.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.610
Maybe I just wanna savor the moment.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.240
I do have all the time in the world.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.120
I'm a free woman.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.416
And that is all thanks to you.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.468
Deputy Chief Ridley, we're a go.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.479
John McIver!

39:59.397 --> 40:03.526
I have a warrant for your arrest for
the attempted murder of Mariah Dillard!

40:03.610 --> 40:06.696
I implore you, come out peacefully!

40:25.298 --> 40:27.008
Harlem's Paradise is empty.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.510
What do you mean, empty?

40:29.594 --> 40:32.138
'Cause he knew what was coming.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.225
Sweet Christmas.

40:46.027 --> 40:47.570
Sweet Christmas.

41:26.442 --> 41:29.529
- Okay, backup is on the way.
- How soon?

41:35.702 --> 41:37.662
Not soon enough.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.585
Luke Cage!

41:45.753 --> 41:47.130
Let me reason with you!

41:48.548 --> 41:50.133
Mad respect, yeah?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.386
You're a hard man to kill!

41:54.137 --> 41:57.056
You can't burn. You can't drown.

41:57.890 --> 41:59.142
So why fight?

42:02.437 --> 42:06.899
Before someone you care about gets killed,
just give me who I came for.

42:08.735 --> 42:11.154
You and your pa can go home.

42:12.780 --> 42:16.576
Misty, too. I just want Mariah Stokes.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.289
No one has to war tonight.

42:23.124 --> 42:26.836
You know who she is. The Devil made flesh.

42:28.254 --> 42:32.675
Give me Mariah Stokes
and let me do what you won't!

42:32.759 --> 42:34.677
Make your choice.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.929
But make it fast.

42:37.013 --> 42:38.765
You seein' another way out of this?

42:39.307 --> 42:40.683
The man does have a point.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.728
- Carl. You can't.
- Shit.

42:43.811 --> 42:44.771
Why not?

42:46.105 --> 42:47.815
After all she's done.

42:47.899 --> 42:51.611
All the pain she's caused.
The misery. The death.

42:51.694 --> 42:56.074
Why shouldn't I throw her through that
window and give Bushmaster what he wants?

42:56.157 --> 42:57.492
Huh?

42:57.575 --> 42:58.659
Tell me, Mariah...

42:59.410 --> 43:02.038
What would you do
if the roles were reversed?

43:02.121 --> 43:05.333
I'd have thrown your ass to the dogs
the minute they started barking.

43:08.961 --> 43:13.091
Yeah. There's only one thing
keeping you alive right now.

43:16.427 --> 43:20.681
Unfortunately,
I was raised better than that.

43:25.061 --> 43:26.187
Shit.

43:33.903 --> 43:36.823
Fine. War it is!

43:44.831 --> 43:45.832
Come on.

43:48.292 --> 43:51.087
Hold on. Hold on. Okay, let's go.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.173
The hell is Cage? Luke!

44:27.331 --> 44:28.457
Shit!

46:26.033 --> 46:28.327
Kiss...

46:30.830 --> 46:31.789
my...

46:34.500 --> 46:35.501
black...

46:39.672 --> 46:40.673
ass.

47:08.659 --> 47:12.913
You wanna stop me? Kill me.

47:14.790 --> 47:18.919
Because I will never stop coming.
As long as I breathe air, I'll keep...

47:24.258 --> 47:28.387
And I'll be here to stop you.
Every single time.

47:29.597 --> 47:31.599
As long as I breathe.

47:56.123 --> 47:59.085
There's something I haven't seen
in a while when you look at me.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.462
- What's that?
- Pride.

48:04.173 --> 48:07.009
Mr. Cage, long time.

48:07.093 --> 48:10.137
Indeed. I heard you got a promotion.

48:10.221 --> 48:12.056
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

48:12.848 --> 48:13.891
Where's Mariah?

48:14.475 --> 48:16.268
Gone. Can't find her anywhere.

48:17.812 --> 48:20.064
- And her immunity deal?
- In the trash.

48:20.147 --> 48:21.732
We've got Bushmaster on attempted murder,

48:21.816 --> 48:24.151
Hammer weapons,
and eyewitnesses to back it up.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.862
Mariah's messed up. Now she's next.

48:26.946 --> 48:28.239
That's what I like to hear.

48:49.135 --> 48:50.886
Ah.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.349
You feel okay?

48:56.433 --> 48:57.560
Right as rain.

49:02.439 --> 49:06.068
I came to Harlem to reconnect with my son.

49:08.654 --> 49:13.868
Didn't play out like I planned,
but it set us on that path.

49:19.665 --> 49:23.210
Why don't you come back
to Georgia with me?

49:24.211 --> 49:25.296
Huh?

49:26.672 --> 49:28.382
Why don't you come on home, son?

49:32.052 --> 49:35.806
You know, you always used to tell me
to finish what I started.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.852
My work in Harlem isn't done yet.

49:41.770 --> 49:43.272
I gotta see this through.

49:45.024 --> 49:46.025
Yeah.

49:49.737 --> 49:52.698
It's a burden. I know.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.994
The darkness that you deal with every day,

49:57.077 --> 50:00.289
the people disconnected
from their souls...

50:02.374 --> 50:06.378
Well, that kinda work can make you angry.

50:06.462 --> 50:09.965
It can consume you whole if you let it.

50:13.052 --> 50:16.180
I know. I do.

50:17.473 --> 50:20.726
So... don't let it.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.689
Don't you make your calling a curse.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.693
You be better than me.

50:37.701 --> 50:43.207
You know, the best part of you,
you got from your mother.

50:47.419 --> 50:51.298
You follow that compass inside of you,
and you will never go wrong.

50:54.510 --> 50:58.264
You know, some of the better parts
are from you, too.

51:01.934 --> 51:05.104
- The swagger.
- You're goddamn right.

51:13.195 --> 51:15.447
I have never been more proud of you.

51:19.243 --> 51:22.830
I love you. I do. I love you, son.

51:25.666 --> 51:26.875
I love you too, Dad.

51:34.383 --> 51:35.926
Come on.

51:40.848 --> 51:44.435
You, uh,
wanna get somethin' to eat?

51:44.518 --> 51:46.478
Shoot, I thought you'd never ask.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.498
What do you know about Jamaica, hmm?

52:08.334 --> 52:12.046
You know the story of Nanny? The Maroons?

52:13.297 --> 52:14.923
She was Asante, you know?

52:15.507 --> 52:21.638
She came over in chains,
but she never forgot who she was. Mmm.

52:23.891 --> 52:26.018
She never forgot the old ways.

52:28.062 --> 52:31.065
Nanny kept the science alive, see?

52:33.442 --> 52:39.323
The British... they put them
in sugar cane fields and beat them.

52:40.074 --> 52:41.241
And raped them.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.078
But the Maroons resisted.

52:45.454 --> 52:48.415
They broke their chains.
And they ran to the hills.

52:49.666 --> 52:54.171
In the Blue Mountains,
they lived off the land. And Nanny...

52:56.298 --> 52:58.842
she would lead raids
to the other plantations.

52:58.926 --> 53:02.554
And they would steal back
the women and children,

53:02.638 --> 53:05.724
so they could raise families
out of captivity.

53:08.936 --> 53:14.233
They cut the heads off their oppressors
and put them on spikes.

53:17.820 --> 53:19.446
To put them on notice.

53:22.157 --> 53:23.742
No white man was safe.

53:25.536 --> 53:30.707
They became masters of camouflage,
covered themselves in leaves,

53:31.417 --> 53:36.547
still as trees
before they struck in the darkness.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.299
Hmm.

53:40.259 --> 53:44.138
Yeah, the British,
they had the technology.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.058
But the Maroons had the will.

53:49.476 --> 53:51.019
The determination.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.647
The magic.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.361
They fought off the British for 80 years.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.030
And won.

54:07.953 --> 54:12.040
That is the true birth
of the real Jamaica.

54:13.041 --> 54:16.753
Resistance. Independence.

54:19.298 --> 54:20.299
Fire.

54:59.254 --> 55:00.547
He needs you.

55:03.050 --> 55:06.345
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, he... He needs a doctor.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.971
You are a doctor.

55:09.640 --> 55:10.974
He needs nightshade.

55:11.558 --> 55:13.060
I don't have enough.

55:14.019 --> 55:17.272
I swear... I swear, I don't...
I don't have enough.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.319
If he dies...

55:24.029 --> 55:25.155
you die.

55:27.491 --> 55:30.577
Please... help me.

55:44.675 --> 55:46.635
We're gonna need someplace quiet.

55:47.928 --> 55:49.846
And we're gonna need it quickly.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.165
I knew you'd find me.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.379
I've got you. Always.

56:24.631 --> 56:26.758
I'm done playing by the rules.

56:28.302 --> 56:30.512
Denying who I really am.

56:32.139 --> 56:33.390
No more.

56:34.683 --> 56:40.147
I am who I am. And I want what's mine.

56:50.365 --> 56:51.742
I have something for you.

56:59.291 --> 57:00.751
Family first, right?

57:03.045 --> 57:04.087
Always.
