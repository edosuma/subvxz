WEBVTT

03:01.984 --> 03:04.782
Nice move, Agatha. You almost
clipped my tail that time.

03:17.199 --> 03:18.496
Higgins?

03:18.967 --> 03:20.366
I'm going to kill you.

03:20.436 --> 03:21.698
Good morning,
Mr. Magnum.

03:21.770 --> 03:22.896
Hi, Agatha.

03:22.971 --> 03:25.098
Higgins, do you have any idea
what time of day it is?

03:25.174 --> 03:26.198
I do.

03:26.275 --> 03:27.799
It's practically
the crack of dawn.

03:27.876 --> 03:30.777
Dawn was one hour and 12 minutes
ago, which, for your information...

03:30.846 --> 03:32.939
most people consider the
beginning of a beautiful day.

03:33.015 --> 03:35.848
For you, apparently, it means
the end of a sordid evening.

03:36.852 --> 03:39.548
Oh, watch it, Agatha, I could have
brought you down with that one.

03:39.621 --> 03:43.216
That sound,
I find it quite irritating.

03:43.292 --> 03:44.486
Hung over, no doubt.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.619
Probably trying to impress
a date by entering...

03:46.695 --> 03:49.596
what some of your society friends
would call a chugalug contest.

03:49.665 --> 03:52.156
Higgins, what are you doing
playing with toy airplanes?

03:52.234 --> 03:53.326
They are not toys.

03:53.402 --> 03:55.870
They are perfect replicas of
RAF and German war planes.

03:55.938 --> 03:58.133
You're playing with toys
like little children.

03:58.207 --> 03:59.936
We are re-enacting
one of the most brilliant...

04:00.008 --> 04:02.101
aerial dog fights
of the Battle of Britain...

04:02.244 --> 04:03.905
in preparation for
the Queen's jubilee.

04:03.979 --> 04:05.412
I am in command of the RAF.

04:05.481 --> 04:07.381
Agatha has been
gracious enough to accept...

04:07.449 --> 04:09.349
the thankless job
of taking the Nazi side.

04:09.418 --> 04:10.976
Well, stop it, now!

04:12.187 --> 04:14.815
Where do you get the gall to tell
me what I should or should not do?

04:14.890 --> 04:16.915
Higgins, I am in no mood
to argue. Just do it!

04:17.024 --> 04:18.515
Jonathan-
Stay out of this, Agatha.

04:18.594 --> 04:20.185
But.
- Decent people can't sleep all day...

04:20.262 --> 04:21.559
they work for a living.
Jonathan!

04:21.630 --> 04:22.756
I'm between cases right now.

04:22.831 --> 04:24.423
Perhaps you wouldn't be
if you stayed home...

04:24.500 --> 04:26.195
and checked your answering
machine once in a while.

04:26.268 --> 04:27.860
It's broken. Did somebody
call me? Jonathan!

04:27.936 --> 04:29.460
Rick. I left a note
on your bureau.

04:29.538 --> 04:31.233
Obviously, you were
too intoxicated to notice.

04:31.306 --> 04:34.673
I was not intoxicated
and I do not have a hangover!

04:34.743 --> 04:36.335
It's just that, that noise...
Jonathan!

04:36.411 --> 04:38.470
Is making me feel
like I have one!

04:38.547 --> 04:40.276
Jonathan.
What is it, Agatha?

04:42.518 --> 04:43.883
Oh, my God!

05:10.946 --> 05:13.176
<i>When you're away from
home and fighting a war...</i>

05:13.248 --> 05:15.011
<i>friends are
the only comfort you have.</i>

05:15.083 --> 05:18.450
<i>In Vietnam, T.C. and Rick were
always there when I needed them.</i>

05:18.654 --> 05:20.383
<i>Now that we're all
home and safe...</i>

05:20.455 --> 05:22.821
<i>we tend to take
each other for granted.</i>

05:23.025 --> 05:25.858
<i>Sometimes we even get
on each other's nerves.</i>

05:25.928 --> 05:27.486
<i>I hated to see that happen.</i>

05:27.563 --> 05:29.656
<i>So, when Rick called
asking for a favor...</i>

05:29.731 --> 05:31.699
<i>I decided that
no matter what it was...</i>

05:31.767 --> 05:34.235
<i>big or small,
I was gonna do it for him.</i>

05:34.303 --> 05:36.203
Baby-sitting?
Forget it.

05:36.371 --> 05:38.202
Not baby-sitting, chaperoning.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.399
For your little sister?

05:39.541 --> 05:41.702
Sounds like baby-sitting
to me. Me, too.

05:41.777 --> 05:43.768
You don't baby-sit
a 22-year-old girl.

05:43.946 --> 05:45.709
Right, you date them.

05:46.515 --> 05:48.676
Not my sister, you don't.
Wendy's not like other girls.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.047
She's sweet and she's innocent.

05:50.118 --> 05:51.483
Well, she is!

05:51.587 --> 05:53.248
How do you know?
She's grown up.

05:53.322 --> 05:55.790
She lives in Chicago, you
haven't seen her in 10 years.

05:55.857 --> 05:58.519
Yeah, a lot of little girls are sweet
and innocent when they're only 12.

05:58.594 --> 06:00.357
Look, you guys,
she just finished studying...

06:00.429 --> 06:02.260
from Our Mother of Mercy
College for Girls.

06:02.331 --> 06:04.697
If you're not innocent,
you don't graduate.

06:05.167 --> 06:08.068
I'm telling you, a guy gets
within one mile of the place...

06:08.136 --> 06:10.502
the nuns come down on him
like the 5th Armored Division.

06:10.839 --> 06:13.535
I know. I checked it out
before I sent her there.

06:13.609 --> 06:16.305
You sent her there?
She must hate you.

06:16.745 --> 06:18.144
I did what was best for her.

06:18.213 --> 06:20.943
Chicago is a tough town to
grow up in without any parents.

06:21.016 --> 06:23.075
I wanted to make sure
she was brought up right.

06:23.151 --> 06:24.914
And innocent.
Exactly.

06:24.987 --> 06:27.478
Well, If she's sweet and
innocent and over 21...

06:27.556 --> 06:29.114
why do you even
need a baby-sitter?

06:29.191 --> 06:30.249
Chaperone.

06:30.325 --> 06:32.793
Because, Thomas, on Wendy's
first trip to the Islands...

06:32.861 --> 06:34.795
I wanna make sure
that she has a good time...

06:34.863 --> 06:36.854
but I don't want her exposed
to any bad elements.

06:36.932 --> 06:38.524
Like men.
Right.

06:39.134 --> 06:42.160
Good. Well, I got the
perfect guy for the job. You.

06:42.237 --> 06:44.364
Very funny. She'll be
with me during the day.

06:44.439 --> 06:47.306
She can't hang around with me at
night while I'm working at the club.

06:47.376 --> 06:49.606
You're the boss, take off.
I can't.

06:49.678 --> 06:53.011
I got a bartender out sick, and
a cook who strangles bus boys.

06:53.081 --> 06:56.881
Oh, come on, Rick, I'd really like to
help you, but I do have other plans.

06:57.252 --> 06:58.583
Change them.

06:59.921 --> 07:01.286
What about T.C.?

07:01.823 --> 07:03.415
That's right, pass it on to me.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.289
He's got an ironclad excuse.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.557
Yes, one you've had very
little experience with lately.

07:08.630 --> 07:09.961
Work, Thomas.

07:10.799 --> 07:12.790
I'm flying some rich guy
and his date...

07:12.868 --> 07:14.859
on a moonlight tour
of the Islands.

07:15.203 --> 07:17.330
He's telling the truth.
I checked it out.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.837
Ball's in your court, man.

07:23.679 --> 07:25.271
I don't know, Rick.

07:25.447 --> 07:28.610
Okay, sure, I could probably
change my plans, but...

07:28.784 --> 07:30.649
But what?
I'd feel funny.

07:30.719 --> 07:32.016
About what?

07:32.854 --> 07:34.253
Well, she's your sister.

07:35.891 --> 07:37.119
I'd feel funny about dating her.

07:37.192 --> 07:40.423
It's not a date!
You're doing me a favor.

07:40.996 --> 07:44.591
But why me? You know lots of
other guys who could take her...

07:44.733 --> 07:45.722
out.

07:46.134 --> 07:48.967
Because, Thomas,
with the exception of T.C...

07:49.638 --> 07:51.799
you're the only other guy
that I trust.

07:57.579 --> 08:00.207
<i>The only thing I remember
learning in the 11th grade...</i>

08:00.282 --> 08:02.876
<i>was that you never date
a buddy's sister.</i>

08:02.951 --> 08:06.648
<i>My pal Norm taught me that, and he
learned it from his ex-pal, Carl...</i>

08:06.722 --> 08:09.782
<i>when he was caught with Carl's
sister on Lookout Point.</i>

08:09.991 --> 08:13.119
<i>Norm and Carl's sister swore it
was all perfectly innocent...</i>

08:13.195 --> 08:15.595
<i>a science project in astronomy.</i>

08:15.764 --> 08:18.460
<i>Norm lost two teeth,
all four white-walls...</i>

08:18.533 --> 08:20.228
<i>on his '56 Merc
and a good friend.</i>

08:20.969 --> 08:23.460
<i>Now, I didn't want that
to happen to me and Rick.</i>

08:23.538 --> 08:25.529
<i>And even though
this was his idea...</i>

08:25.607 --> 08:27.541
<i>and it was all
perfectly innocent...</i>

08:27.609 --> 08:30.442
<i>it wouldn't have taken much
to seem otherwise.</i>

08:31.980 --> 08:33.241
You couldn't wear a tie?

08:33.482 --> 08:35.006
I don't wear ties on dates.

08:35.317 --> 08:36.943
This isn't a date.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.177
Okay, fine, it's not a date.

08:40.288 --> 08:42.586
What are you doing here,
anyway? I thought you trusted me.

08:42.657 --> 08:44.022
You don't think
that I was gonna...

08:44.092 --> 08:45.491
let you take her out
before I talked to you.

08:45.560 --> 08:46.754
You got her a suite.

08:46.828 --> 08:48.125
I want her to be comfortable.

08:48.196 --> 08:49.823
Listen, now, a few ground rules.

08:49.931 --> 08:51.558
Tonight is strictly G-rated.

08:51.633 --> 08:53.760
I think there's a Disney
flick playing over at the Cove.

08:53.835 --> 08:56.463
I know. <i>Bambi.</i>
I saw it two nights ago.

08:56.538 --> 08:58.062
Good. See it again.

08:58.140 --> 09:00.301
And then afterwards
you can stop for a soda.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.707
And you want me to get her in by?
10:30.

09:02.778 --> 09:05.178
And I'm gonna call
from the club to check.

09:05.881 --> 09:07.143
So, where is she?

09:08.283 --> 09:09.978
She's tucking in her teddy bear.

09:10.652 --> 09:13.052
A 22-year-old girl travels
with her teddy bear?

09:14.256 --> 09:16.087
I bought it for her
for Christmas.

09:16.658 --> 09:18.649
You're sick.

09:27.836 --> 09:32.034
Thomas, I want you to meet
my sister, Wendy.

09:33.341 --> 09:34.899
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Magnum.

09:34.976 --> 09:36.136
Nice to meet you, Wendy.

09:36.211 --> 09:37.473
She's beautiful, isn't she?

09:37.546 --> 09:39.673
Oh, Orvie,
please, I'm not pretty.

09:39.881 --> 09:41.508
You are so.
Isn't she, Thomas?

09:42.050 --> 09:43.244
She sure is.

09:43.418 --> 09:44.851
You could say that again.

09:46.087 --> 09:48.021
Look, I think
we better get going.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.080
Movie starts in 15 minutes.

09:50.492 --> 09:52.824
Now, if you need me for anything,
just call me at the club.

09:52.894 --> 09:54.657
I'll call you before
I go to sleep, Orvie.

09:54.729 --> 09:56.219
And remember, 10:30.

09:56.298 --> 09:57.526
I'll remember, Orvie.

09:57.599 --> 09:58.998
And drive slow.

09:59.668 --> 10:02.364
And absolutely no bars.

10:02.504 --> 10:05.701
The closest she's come to
alcohol has been sacramental wine.

10:10.779 --> 10:12.508
I'll have a Bora Gora Bazooka.

10:12.581 --> 10:13.673
A what?

10:13.748 --> 10:15.238
A Bora Gora Bazooka.

10:15.317 --> 10:17.182
That's two kinds of
rum, vodka...

10:17.252 --> 10:19.413
three kinds of liqueur,
and, I think, fruit punch.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.718
I'll have a beer
in a longneck bottle.

10:24.226 --> 10:26.217
Look, we shouldn't be
in a place like this.

10:26.294 --> 10:27.522
Rick wouldn't like it.

10:27.596 --> 10:30.394
Relax, will you?
I'm over 21.

10:30.799 --> 10:32.027
Okay.

10:32.100 --> 10:35.729
Okay, but just one drink, like
you promised, then we are leaving.

10:36.371 --> 10:39.238
God, I just feel
naked without makeup.

10:44.546 --> 10:46.013
What are you doing?

10:46.781 --> 10:48.612
Don't worry, silly.

10:48.950 --> 10:50.941
I got clothes on under here.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.654
I'm not an exhibitionist.

10:54.723 --> 10:56.384
Where did you get that outfit?

10:56.925 --> 10:58.187
Vegas.

10:58.927 --> 11:01.623
Vegas?
What about the convent?

11:02.564 --> 11:05.158
Well, they don't put bars
on the windows, you know.

11:06.434 --> 11:08.834
Well, Rick thinks.
- That I'm the perfect little sister.

11:09.004 --> 11:12.633
I know. I try to keep
up the image for him.

11:12.707 --> 11:14.698
That's why I wore
that stupid outfit.

11:14.776 --> 11:17.006
If he saw me like this,
he would croak.

11:18.013 --> 11:19.310
No kidding.

11:19.581 --> 11:22.243
Listen, he's a nice brother,
and he's spent a lot of money...

11:22.317 --> 11:23.682
to make sure I would turn out...

11:23.752 --> 11:25.811
to be his image
of the perfect sister.

11:26.087 --> 11:27.918
Why should I disappoint him?

11:28.290 --> 11:30.781
I tell him the things he
wants to hear and he's happy.

11:31.359 --> 11:32.826
It's worked for 10 years.

11:33.895 --> 11:36.659
And it'll go on working,
if you don't tell him.

11:37.766 --> 11:40.963
Wendy, this is not a date.

11:41.603 --> 11:44.697
Oh, come on,
don't be an old poop.

11:44.773 --> 11:46.604
You're a good-looking guy.

11:46.675 --> 11:47.903
We could have fun.

11:49.044 --> 11:50.204
That's it!

11:50.278 --> 11:52.746
Come on, I should have never
let you drag me into this place.

11:52.814 --> 11:55.078
Come on, we can still get
the last half of <i>Bambi.</i>

11:55.150 --> 11:57.084
Thumper is probably still alive.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.281
Relax, will you?

11:59.988 --> 12:02.923
Jeez, you'd think I had
the plague or something.

12:03.825 --> 12:06.953
All right, you wanna
play Mr. Nice Guy, fine.

12:08.964 --> 12:11.296
Can't we just stay
for that one drink?

12:13.268 --> 12:17.170
Besides, I got to go
use the ladies' room.

12:18.974 --> 12:20.464
I won't be long.

12:22.177 --> 12:24.577
<i>The truth is,
after that little scene...</i>

12:24.713 --> 12:27.147
<i>I was in no hurry for her
to get back at all.</i>

12:27.248 --> 12:29.045
<i>She'd given me
one big surprise...</i>

12:29.117 --> 12:31.176
<i>and I was willing to bet
she had a few more.</i>

12:31.252 --> 12:33.277
<i>As she walked away,
I couldn't help but think...</i>

12:33.355 --> 12:35.220
<i>about Mother Mercy
College for Girls.</i>

12:35.290 --> 12:37.884
<i>If innocence was a
requirement for graduation...</i>

12:37.959 --> 12:40.621
<i>old Wendy had cheated
on the final.</i>

12:53.675 --> 12:55.768
Hey, fella, wanna dance?

13:13.695 --> 13:17.654
<i>I'd been contemplating the ramifications
of friendship and favors...</i>

13:17.732 --> 13:19.723
<i>for about half an hour
when it occurred to me...</i>

13:19.801 --> 13:22.395
<i>that Wendy had been gone
a long time.</i>

14:05.580 --> 14:06.877
Wendy?

14:07.882 --> 14:09.110
Wendy!

14:12.487 --> 14:14.819
You must have got
the wrong door.

14:14.889 --> 14:16.516
Oh, no, I was...

14:18.460 --> 14:19.757
You're not...

14:19.994 --> 14:23.020
I'm not?
I was when I went in.

14:23.598 --> 14:25.828
You are?
Oh, yeah.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.525
Well, of course you are.

14:27.936 --> 14:29.733
I just didn't expect...
I mean...

14:30.004 --> 14:32.029
Well, see,
I was waiting for my date.

14:32.107 --> 14:33.665
Well, actually,
she's not my date.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.539
She's more like
my little sister.

14:37.112 --> 14:38.977
Well, she's not my sister,
she's-

14:39.047 --> 14:42.312
Well, whoever she is, you won't
find her in there. It's empty.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.249
<i>The last time I broke curfew...</i>

14:52.325 --> 14:54.259
<i>was the night of my senior prom.</i>

14:54.327 --> 14:56.056
<i>One of my buddies and I
took our dates...</i>

14:56.128 --> 14:58.187
<i>to Virginia Beach
to watch the sunrise.</i>

14:58.264 --> 15:01.392
<i>When I got home, my mother
took the keys to my DeSoto...</i>

15:01.467 --> 15:03.799
<i>and it sat in the driveway
for the month of June.</i>

15:03.869 --> 15:05.666
<i>The curfew Rick set
for Wendy and me...</i>

15:05.738 --> 15:07.501
<i>had come and gone two hours ago.</i>

15:07.573 --> 15:10.167
<i>I'd called her hotel
10 times with no luck...</i>

15:10.242 --> 15:12.767
<i>and I'd looked around every bar
and disco I could think of.</i>

15:12.845 --> 15:16.178
<i>I figured it was better to show
up late, than empty-handed.</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:18.011
<i>Now I was both.</i>

15:18.084 --> 15:19.847
What do you mean
she's not answering?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.682
Just keep trying!

15:22.154 --> 15:24.019
Thomas?
Thomas?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.149
You mean they're not back yet? No.

15:26.225 --> 15:29.353
And it's after midnight.
I can't understand where he could have taken her.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.794
Well, did you try his place?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.958
Don't get funny. He might be
irresponsible, but he's not crazy.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.729
Hi, guys.
There he is.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.268
Where have you been?
It's way past curfew.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.239
I guess that means
Wendy isn't here.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.073
What do you mean she isn't here?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.240
Isn't she with you?
No, she isn't.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.146
Uh-oh. Well,
it's been a nice evening.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.480
I guess I'd better go.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.849
T.C., don't leave.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.547
T.C., please, just sit down.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.125
What do you got
to tell me, Thomas?

16:02.061 --> 16:03.551
Well, Rick...

16:04.063 --> 16:07.260
I think I kind of
lost your sister.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.167
Or she lost me or we both
lost each other.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.396
I don't know, Rick.

16:11.470 --> 16:14.064
I mean, she went in the ladles'
room and she never came out.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.870
And the only person I saw
was Carol Channing.

16:17.443 --> 16:18.933
At the movies?

16:19.545 --> 16:21.570
Not exactly.
Then where?

16:26.385 --> 16:27.750
Tijuana Tokyo.

16:27.887 --> 16:29.286
That punk club?

16:33.592 --> 16:36.720
I'm gonna remain very calm
when I ask this next question.

16:37.763 --> 16:41.096
What the hell were you doing in
a place like that with my sister?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.761
It was her idea. I told
her you would not approve.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.996
Don't give me that.

16:45.071 --> 16:47.130
Rick, look, you haven't
seen your sister in 10 years.

16:47.206 --> 16:50.403
Did you ever think that she might
not be exactly what she seems?

16:50.476 --> 16:52.842
Are you telling me that my
sister isn't sweet and innocent?

16:52.912 --> 16:57.110
Sweet? Yeah, I think, yeah,
probably, yeah, she's very sweet...

16:57.183 --> 16:58.878
but, Rick, believe me...

17:00.519 --> 17:02.487
she's not innocent anymore.

17:02.721 --> 17:06.919
If you laid one hand on her,
one hand, I'll kill you.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.460
What are you talking about?
I wouldn't touch your sister.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.858
That's what happened, isn't it?

17:10.930 --> 17:12.295
You tried to put
a move on her...

17:12.364 --> 17:13.694
she panicked, and she ran away.

17:13.766 --> 17:14.790
No!

17:14.867 --> 17:18.358
Look, maybe she ran away because her brother
treats her like she's in kindergarten.

17:18.436 --> 17:19.869
Whoa, shut up, both of you.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.430
Getting hysterical
is not gonna solve anything.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.069
What's the big deal anyway?

17:25.444 --> 17:27.105
She's 22. It's 12:30.

17:27.179 --> 17:30.478
She probably got bored with
Thomas here and went for a walk.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.743
She's probably home by now.

17:31.817 --> 17:34.547
I called there.
She didn't answer.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.410
Oh.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.423
Maybe she's in the shower.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.961
Yeah,
she could be in the shower.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.471
Wendy?

17:55.541 --> 17:57.338
Wendy, are you all right?
It's Rick.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.603
Wendy!

18:00.446 --> 18:02.209
Thomas, come on, give me a hand.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.411
Check the bathroom.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.446
Have a nice evening.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.558
Any evidence of foul play?

18:48.627 --> 18:50.117
No.
Yes.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.823
Rick,
there was a guy in the room.

18:51.897 --> 18:54.161
It had to be a burglar. He
couldn't have been after Wendy.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.167
We don't know that!
Look, he was there alone.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.499
Wendy wasn't home yet. It
was just a burglar, officer.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.766
Make up your mind.
Was there foul play or not?

19:00.839 --> 19:01.863
Not.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.932
Okay, then this makes it
a missing persons report.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.341
Yeah, right. I trust this guy
with her and now she's missing.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.039
Come on, Rick.
Now, please, please.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.275
Can we just fill out the report?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.146
Now, what was she wearing?

19:13.219 --> 19:16.120
She was wearing a conservative,
two-piece green dress...

19:16.188 --> 19:17.553
that came below her knees.

19:17.623 --> 19:21.115
She was wearing a gray leather
miniskirt and a purple bikini top.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.251
Hey, look, Thomas,
that's perverted.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.320
Now, she was wearing a green two-piece
dress that came below her knees.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.093
I saw it with my own two eyes.
And I saw her take it off.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.996
I mean, I saw her
take the dress off...

19:31.070 --> 19:33.231
and she had the skirt
and top underneath it.

19:33.739 --> 19:36.401
No way. There's no way.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.137
What kinds of places was
she most likely to frequent?

19:41.280 --> 19:44.738
Churches, zoos-
Bars, discos, head shops.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.510
Are you two guys talking
about the same girl?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.484
Why don't you go home?

19:50.556 --> 19:52.456
Look, you wanna
find her, don't you?

19:52.891 --> 19:54.449
Let me ask something simple.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.252
Did she wear makeup?

19:56.328 --> 19:57.352
Yes.
No.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.561
I'm gonna try one more.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.697
Did she have any distinctive
jewelry or a handbag?

20:08.907 --> 20:11.740
Yeah, she was carrying
a large lavender bag.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.107
Any objections?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.708
No, she had the bag.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.814
Good, finally we all agree
on something.

20:21.520 --> 20:22.680
You the relative?

20:24.356 --> 20:26.051
Yeah, I'm her brother.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.486
Okay, you got forms to fill out.

20:28.627 --> 20:29.719
This way.

20:29.895 --> 20:30.953
Rick.

20:32.731 --> 20:36.189
Look, I was telling the truth.
I'm just trying to find her.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.265
Hey, come on.
How about a cup of coffee?

20:39.338 --> 20:40.532
No, thanks.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.472
Why don't you take
somebody else up?

20:43.542 --> 20:45.305
Is this
a sight-seeing tour, huh?

20:46.111 --> 20:48.045
Take your hands
off of me, honey.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.775
It happens all the time.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.805
It's been one of those nights.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.214
Hey, let me show you
a little trick.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.492
The humidity makes
the cups stick together.

21:37.863 --> 21:41.731
Listen, I overheard that
missing persons report...

21:41.800 --> 21:43.165
you and your friend filed.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.567
This wahine
you're looking for...

21:45.637 --> 21:47.366
is she a working girl?

21:48.340 --> 21:49.739
Wendy? No.

21:50.075 --> 21:53.067
I didn't wanna say anything
in front of your friend...

21:53.145 --> 21:57.343
but we found a girl tonight, face
down, in a trash bin on Hotel Street.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.709
She fit
the description you gave.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.713
A blonde, gray skirt,
purple top?

22:03.789 --> 22:07.589
Yeah, we find local girls
in all kinds of places.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.217
This might be just another.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.092
But I thought you might
wanna check it out.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.095
Yeah, I will.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.797
It's not gonna be Wendy. She was
on the other side of the Island.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.337
Probably isn't.

23:00.852 --> 23:03.320
<i>When Rick saw his
sister, he didn't react.</i>

23:03.381 --> 23:06.009
<i>He didn't flinch,
or cry, or say a word.</i>

23:06.084 --> 23:07.711
<i>He just walked out.</i>

23:07.785 --> 23:11.084
<i>I wanted to say something that
might help, but I couldn't.</i>

23:12.390 --> 23:14.187
Are you all right?
You look awful.

23:14.259 --> 23:15.954
I'm fine.
What did you find out?

23:16.127 --> 23:18.925
Not too much. She doesn't
have a criminal record...

23:19.030 --> 23:22.466
and she was a perfect student at the
Catholic school until her senior year.

23:22.533 --> 23:24.899
She was kicked out six months
before graduation.

23:24.969 --> 23:25.993
What happened?

23:26.070 --> 23:28.538
When I asked the Mother Superior
she said, "Let us pray"...

23:28.606 --> 23:30.733
and started saying the rosary.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.510
Anything else?

23:33.611 --> 23:35.909
Well, you know, the two week stay
with Rick she was planning on?

23:35.980 --> 23:38.244
I don't think she was
really planning on it.

23:38.483 --> 23:39.950
What do you mean?

23:41.719 --> 23:42.743
Check this out.

23:42.820 --> 23:45.015
This is Wendy's airline ticket.

23:52.463 --> 23:55.660
She was booked on the red-rye
to Chicago last night?

23:56.668 --> 23:59.933
Not much time set aside
for a family reunion, huh?

24:01.873 --> 24:03.636
What else do you got in there? Nothing.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.505
Come on. Come on, Carol.
I told you everything.

24:05.576 --> 24:08.044
You wouldn't have a big file
like that just for this ticket.

24:08.112 --> 24:10.910
Thomas. Please, come on,
I need to know.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.280
Please.

24:18.756 --> 24:21.919
If you find out anything in your
investigation, before I do...

24:21.993 --> 24:23.290
you have to share.

24:23.361 --> 24:24.658
Deal.

24:25.063 --> 24:26.325
Deal.

24:36.374 --> 24:37.500
Who are they?

24:37.575 --> 24:40.373
From what we could find out through
prints done on clothes labels...

24:40.445 --> 24:42.072
these two never existed.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.979
All information about them has
been wiped off the computer.

24:45.049 --> 24:46.539
What do they have
to do with Wendy?

24:46.617 --> 24:48.278
They were found in trash bins...

24:48.353 --> 24:50.048
two blocks from
where we found Wendy.

24:50.221 --> 24:52.086
And they were shot,
one bullet apiece.

24:52.223 --> 24:54.088
Executioner style.

24:54.592 --> 24:55.650
Like Wendy.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.217
We don't have
a ballistics report yet...

24:57.295 --> 24:59.991
but I think all three were
killed by the same gun.

25:03.368 --> 25:04.926
Can I keep this?

25:08.206 --> 25:09.969
<i>When someone
close to you dies...</i>

25:10.041 --> 25:11.770
<i>it's a hard thing to accept.</i>

25:11.843 --> 25:14.311
<i>But when the image
you had of them dies, too...</i>

25:14.379 --> 25:16.210
<i>well, that kind of
disillusionment...</i>

25:16.280 --> 25:18.077
<i>is almost impossible
to go on living with.</i>

25:18.216 --> 25:19.649
<i>I didn't know
whether to tell Rick...</i>

25:19.717 --> 25:21.651
<i>what I'd found out
about his sister.</i>

25:21.719 --> 25:23.550
<i>I did know what he needed now...</i>

25:23.621 --> 25:25.555
<i>was to have his friends
by his side.</i>

25:25.957 --> 25:27.254
Get lost, Thomas.

25:29.761 --> 25:30.819
What?

25:30.895 --> 25:33.557
You heard me, get out of
here. I don't want to see you.

25:34.532 --> 25:37.467
Rick, I think you need
your friends right now.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.661
Friends?

25:38.736 --> 25:41.830
Because of you my only sister
is lying on a slab in a morgue.

25:42.807 --> 25:43.899
Some protection you were.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.465
One night and she's dead.

25:51.215 --> 25:54.343
I don't know, Rick, maybe I
should have gone after her sooner.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.144
A little late now, isn't it?

25:57.355 --> 25:59.220
I'm sorry, Rick.
Sorry?

25:59.991 --> 26:01.219
Sorry?

26:02.160 --> 26:03.684
A lot of good sorry is gonna do.

26:03.761 --> 26:06.025
It's not gonna bring
my sister back, is it?

26:06.597 --> 26:09.498
I know.
- I told you to get out of here.

26:11.002 --> 26:13.402
Look, Rick, I'm gonna find out
how this happened. I promise.

26:13.471 --> 26:14.460
Just forget it.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.006
Go ride your
surf-ski or something.

26:16.073 --> 26:18.007
I'll handle this thing
in my own way.

26:20.478 --> 26:23.208
You might not like
what you're gonna find out.

26:23.414 --> 26:24.506
What?

26:24.582 --> 26:26.277
What are you gonna
start with that again?

26:26.350 --> 26:28.716
You're gonna tell me that my
sister wore suggestive clothes?

26:28.786 --> 26:31.277
Or that she ran away from you
because she wanted to party all night?

26:31.355 --> 26:32.947
I guess that makes it
not your fault.

26:33.024 --> 26:35.049
I guess that's all you need
to ease your conscience.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.889
Cut it out, Rick.
Yeah, I'll cut it out.

26:36.961 --> 26:39.623
I'll cut it out the minute
I never see your face again.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.219
What about this?
What about what?

27:03.287 --> 27:04.652
Wendy's plane ticket.

27:04.722 --> 27:07.020
She was booked to fly back
to Chicago last night.

27:07.091 --> 27:08.217
No, she wasn't.

27:08.292 --> 27:10.226
She was gonna stay two weeks.

27:10.328 --> 27:11.727
The police found this
in her room.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.195
Look at the date.

27:14.165 --> 27:15.564
Look at the date, Rick.

27:25.877 --> 27:27.003
The airline made a mistake.

27:27.078 --> 27:28.636
I booked these tickets myself.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.811
Well, so she changed them, Rick.

27:30.882 --> 27:32.076
That's not all.

27:32.149 --> 27:34.674
The police found a couple
of guys shot to death...

27:34.819 --> 27:37.117
about two blocks from
where they found Wendy.

27:37.321 --> 27:39.482
Now, Carol thinks
they may be connected.

27:40.157 --> 27:41.556
I think you're both wrong.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.184
You're just trying to
fabricate something...

27:43.261 --> 27:44.728
so it looks like
you're not to blame.

27:44.795 --> 27:47.320
Rick, if you wanna find out
who killed your sister...

27:48.733 --> 27:51.224
you're gonna have to realize
she's not the perfect angel...

27:51.302 --> 27:52.667
you thought she was.

27:52.737 --> 27:55.171
She was probably mixed up
in something pretty bad.

27:55.239 --> 27:56.797
Now you're gonna
have to face that.

27:56.874 --> 27:58.068
Now or later.

28:02.213 --> 28:03.942
You're off the case.

28:27.605 --> 28:29.539
Higgins, I...

28:33.344 --> 28:35.073
Do you have to sneak up
on me like that?

28:35.146 --> 28:36.238
Now look what you've done.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.474
I'm sorry, Higgins.
I didn't realize.

28:37.548 --> 28:38.742
It's your fault
this aeroplane's...

28:38.816 --> 28:40.181
in this condition
in the first place.

28:40.251 --> 28:42.378
Well, who asked you to fly
that damn thing at dawn?

28:42.453 --> 28:45.354
Maybe you should have the common
decency to think of me for a change.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.822
I'm sick of...

28:47.959 --> 28:48.948
Constant...

29:07.078 --> 29:08.773
My God, what's wrong?

29:13.651 --> 29:14.913
Do you want a whiskey?

29:14.986 --> 29:16.180
Please.

29:21.726 --> 29:25.127
Did something go wrong while
you were escorting Rick's sister?

29:27.164 --> 29:29.223
Something went very wrong,
she's dead.

29:31.702 --> 29:33.636
I hope you're joking.

29:34.305 --> 29:36.000
I wish I was. She...

29:43.447 --> 29:46.780
She went to the ladies' room
and she never came out.

29:48.719 --> 29:51.449
And then I was
identifying the body...

29:52.790 --> 29:54.883
and what happened in between,
I don't know.

29:55.593 --> 29:57.185
My God.

30:06.504 --> 30:08.199
Rick slugged me, Higgins.

30:09.173 --> 30:10.504
I'm sure you had no idea that...

30:10.574 --> 30:12.838
this young woman was in
any kind of danger.

30:12.910 --> 30:14.468
And if you did,
I have no doubt...

30:14.545 --> 30:16.672
that you would have done
everything within your power...

30:16.747 --> 30:18.237
to protect her.

30:18.315 --> 30:20.579
I wish I could make
Rick believe that.

30:22.353 --> 30:24.787
I lost one of my best friends.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.850
This reminds me of something
that happened in our regiment...

30:30.928 --> 30:33.556
during our campaign to rid
Burma of the Japanese.

30:33.631 --> 30:36.225
Come on, please, Higgins,
I'm in no mood.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.564
Our squad was approaching
the village where Thisithu...

30:38.636 --> 30:41.002
our Burmese guide's
family lived.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.400
When we got to the site...

30:42.473 --> 30:44.941
we saw that the entire village
had been wiped out.

30:46.310 --> 30:49.370
And, even though Thisithu knew
the Japanese were responsible...

30:49.647 --> 30:52.741
he took out his knife and held
it to Captain Graham's throat.

30:55.820 --> 30:56.912
What happened?

30:56.987 --> 30:59.547
Well, out of fear
for our Captain's life...

30:59.623 --> 31:02.023
we were forced
to shoot Thisithu.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.428
We buried him
next to his family.

31:07.364 --> 31:09.423
What's this have to do
with Rick's sister?

31:09.500 --> 31:11.400
Thisithu was merely
using Captain Graham...

31:11.469 --> 31:13.334
to vent the anger
he had for himself.

31:13.404 --> 31:15.872
He was ridden with guilt because
he wasn't in his village...

31:15.940 --> 31:17.874
when his family needed him.

31:17.942 --> 31:19.170
I later realized that...

31:19.243 --> 31:21.711
Thisithu had no intention
of harming the Captain.

31:23.247 --> 31:24.714
He wanted us to harm him.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.951
We are going where?

31:35.292 --> 31:36.623
To see Ice Pick.

31:41.298 --> 31:42.663
Stop the car.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.165
Oh, come on, T.C.

31:44.235 --> 31:45.293
Stop the car.

31:45.369 --> 31:47.132
I am going nowhere
near that man.

31:47.204 --> 31:49.934
Look, Rick wasn't at the club,
or at his place.

31:50.007 --> 31:52.567
And he told me he was gonna
catch Wendy's killers his way...

31:52.643 --> 31:54.543
which means-
He's going to see Ice Pick.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.273
I don't care.

31:56.347 --> 31:57.644
You can go alone.

31:57.715 --> 32:00.013
The man gives me goose bumps.
Now, stop the car.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.348
What are you afraid of?
He's a frail old man.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.554
Yeah, with about 20 huge guys...

32:04.655 --> 32:06.145
with guns, that have killed...

32:06.223 --> 32:09.351
maybe 100 people.
Stop the car!

32:09.426 --> 32:11.053
He's not gonna
hurt Rick's friends.

32:11.128 --> 32:12.152
He loves Rick.

32:12.229 --> 32:14.697
He's gonna welcome us
with open arms.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.125
How's it going, Ice Pick?

32:19.203 --> 32:21.103
Only my friends call me that.

32:25.476 --> 32:27.410
And you two aren't my friends.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.810
Uh-oh. Let's go.
Relax, T.C.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.643
What would you
like us to call you?

32:32.049 --> 32:33.516
Smitty.

32:33.584 --> 32:36.382
Now, let's get to the point
of this little visit.

32:36.453 --> 32:38.751
Well, we're looking for Rick.
Have you seen him?

32:38.823 --> 32:40.654
Maybe I have, maybe I haven't.

32:40.724 --> 32:41.782
That's enough for me.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.793
Oh, come on, T.C.
Come on.

32:44.595 --> 32:46.256
Look, Smitty...

32:46.330 --> 32:48.764
I don't know whether you heard
about Rick's sister, or not-

32:48.833 --> 32:50.232
She's dead.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.861
Someone dies on this island,
I'm the first one notified.

32:52.937 --> 32:54.097
Well, that's why
we thought Rick...

32:54.171 --> 32:56.469
came to see you,
to find out what happened.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.804
Yeah, what did happen?

33:00.311 --> 33:02.711
You know his sister was a mule?

33:03.747 --> 33:06.716
She was carrying
for a dealer in Chicago.

33:07.084 --> 33:08.676
Did you tell Rick that?

33:08.752 --> 33:10.276
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

33:10.354 --> 33:11.821
I got a sister, too, you know.

33:11.889 --> 33:14.016
Anybody said that to me,
I'd kill them.

33:14.091 --> 33:15.752
Then Rick did
come here to see you?

33:15.826 --> 33:18.624
Who else?
I get results, Magnum.

33:18.996 --> 33:21.055
He tells me you don't.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.227
What did you tell him, Ice Pick?

33:24.368 --> 33:26.029
He said Smitty, I swear it.

33:26.103 --> 33:27.570
I didn't tell him much.

33:27.638 --> 33:29.799
I gave him
a nice deal on an Uzi.

33:30.307 --> 33:31.706
Fully automatic.

33:31.775 --> 33:33.709
What would he want with an Uzi?

33:33.777 --> 33:36.610
All of my weapons are
unconditionally guaranteed...

33:36.680 --> 33:39.478
that I won't mention to anyone
what they're used for.

33:39.550 --> 33:42.144
Come on, Rick was real upset.
If you care about him...

33:42.219 --> 33:43.846
you'd tell us
what he was planning.

33:44.021 --> 33:46.489
If you're trying to
appeal to my humanity...

33:46.557 --> 33:48.081
you're wasting my time.

33:48.792 --> 33:52.660
Rick's doing exactly what I
would do, if I were in his shoes.

33:53.130 --> 33:57.533
Except, I'd hire one of
these guys to do it for me.

33:58.002 --> 33:59.936
Think that Rick knows
who killed his sister?

34:00.137 --> 34:02.332
You got it, big guy.
He's on his way to Molokai...

34:02.406 --> 34:04.499
right now
on a little hunting trip.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.707
Let's go.

34:07.845 --> 34:11.042
You can't stop him,
it's too late!

34:37.706 --> 34:40.107
Got any idea where we should
start looking?

34:40.677 --> 34:42.440
The guy at the club
said the speedboat was gone.

34:42.512 --> 34:44.172
That's how he'd
have to get to the island.

34:44.246 --> 34:45.646
So?

34:45.849 --> 34:47.942
So, we'll recognize
the boat when we see it.

34:48.016 --> 34:50.542
I figure we'll just fly around
the island until we spot it.

34:50.620 --> 34:53.282
Great. That takes time,
and we don't have much.

34:53.389 --> 34:56.483
Well, it would take him two
hours to get there by boat.

34:56.559 --> 34:57.753
It'll only takes us ten minutes.

34:57.827 --> 34:59.692
He doesn't have
that great a head start.

36:08.064 --> 36:10.658
T.M., got any idea how
we are gonna save Orville...

36:10.733 --> 36:11.722
once we find him?

36:11.801 --> 36:12.961
Nope.

36:13.036 --> 36:15.903
You mean you haven't figured
out one of your famous plans?

36:15.972 --> 36:18.270
I was kind of hoping
you might have one.

36:20.376 --> 36:21.809
There it is.

36:28.117 --> 36:29.607
Any sign of Orville?

36:30.286 --> 36:31.514
No.

36:40.296 --> 36:43.322
Find a clearing
and set her down, T.C.

37:14.263 --> 37:16.060
Freeze!

37:17.100 --> 37:18.658
Throw the guns on the floor!

37:19.635 --> 37:20.966
All right, what's going on?

37:21.037 --> 37:23.631
You're the guy that
was in my sister's room.

37:24.107 --> 37:26.507
Why did you kill my sister?

37:32.548 --> 37:35.244
Relax, just relax.
We didn't kill anybody.

37:35.318 --> 37:36.410
You got the wrong guys.

37:36.486 --> 37:38.386
Don't give me that crap.
You killed her!

37:38.454 --> 37:39.887
Wendy Wright your sister?

37:40.990 --> 37:43.117
Well, then, you're looking
for the guys that live here.

37:43.192 --> 37:44.887
Yeah, we're looking for them, too. Bull!

37:44.961 --> 37:47.555
You got to believe us.
We're federal agents.

37:47.630 --> 37:48.995
Show me your IDs.

37:49.065 --> 37:50.692
We're undercover,
we don't carry IDs.

37:50.767 --> 37:51.893
We could get searched.

37:52.035 --> 37:53.161
Not good enough.

37:53.236 --> 37:55.227
Hey, a couple of our guys
got killed last night...

37:55.304 --> 37:56.771
trying to bust
a couple of dealers.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.602
Now, we think these
might be the guys.

37:58.741 --> 38:00.538
What about my sister?

38:00.610 --> 38:02.237
You're not gonna like this.

38:02.311 --> 38:04.336
We think your sister was
carrying drugs from Chicago.

38:04.414 --> 38:06.405
She must have made the delivery
at the time of the bust...

38:06.482 --> 38:08.814
saw the killing and had to be
killed because she was a witness.

38:08.885 --> 38:09.943
You're lying.

38:10.186 --> 38:11.278
No!

38:14.490 --> 38:16.549
It's me, Thomas.
Don't shoot.

38:16.626 --> 38:17.854
Get out of here, Thomas!

38:17.927 --> 38:20.361
Look, I just want to
talk to you Rick, please.

38:20.430 --> 38:24.730
Come on, I'm gonna stand up,
so you can see me, okay, Rick?

38:28.371 --> 38:31.568
Easy, Rick.
Just take it easy.

38:32.942 --> 38:34.705
Yeah, Rick, relax.

38:38.915 --> 38:40.678
Just relax, just relax.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.184
Hey, we really are
Federal agents.

38:43.252 --> 38:44.981
Hey, man, they could
be telling the truth.

38:45.054 --> 38:46.521
You could be
killing innocent men.

38:46.589 --> 38:47.988
They're lying, they're lying.

38:48.057 --> 38:49.854
They killed Wendy.
Her bag's right there.

38:49.926 --> 38:52.053
Hey, the other guys
left it behind.

38:52.829 --> 38:57.061
Let's just take
these guys in, Rick, okay?

38:57.133 --> 38:59.624
We've got the chopper outside,
we'll fly them back to Oahu...

38:59.702 --> 39:00.691
and turn them in.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.704
If they're telling the truth,
no harm done.

39:03.506 --> 39:05.633
If they're lying, we'll
let the police handle it.

39:05.708 --> 39:07.335
Yeah, yeah, just take us in.

39:07.410 --> 39:10.140
Don't talk to me like a
little kid or like I'm crazy.

39:10.213 --> 39:13.705
Just get the hell out of here and
let me handle this in my own way.

39:27.096 --> 39:29.428
You idiot,
those are the guys you want!

39:29.499 --> 39:30.591
Oh, my God!

39:59.529 --> 40:00.962
There they are.

40:01.631 --> 40:02.825
You ready, hotshot?

40:02.899 --> 40:04.366
What do you think?

40:04.800 --> 40:07.462
Hold it, Rick, till we see
if they want to surrender.

40:07.537 --> 40:09.061
I mean it.

40:46.809 --> 40:48.504
Still think they
want to surrender?

40:48.578 --> 40:50.671
Man, I wish I had me
a rocket launcher.

40:50.746 --> 40:52.543
You didn't need rockets
when I was your gunner.

40:52.615 --> 40:53.946
Will you just get me in closer?

40:54.016 --> 40:55.608
Guys, this isn't Nam.

41:11.968 --> 41:13.526
Can't you get any closer?

41:45.001 --> 41:46.593
I almost had them that time.

41:46.669 --> 41:48.534
Don't worry, we'll get them.

42:02.852 --> 42:04.046
What are we waiting for?

42:04.186 --> 42:05.414
Take it easy, Rick.

42:05.488 --> 42:08.013
Yeah, let them come to us.

42:17.867 --> 42:19.664
Here they come.

43:23.632 --> 43:25.657
<i>At the beginning of
Wendy's senior year...</i>

43:25.735 --> 43:29.171
<i>she fell in love with the wrong
guy, a drug dealer in Chicago.</i>

43:29.238 --> 43:31.468
<i>He got her kicked out of
school and while she was here...</i>

43:31.540 --> 43:34.134
<i>making a simple delivery
for him, she was killed.</i>

43:34.243 --> 43:37.212
<i>A note was found in Wendy's
room that she'd left for Rick.</i>

43:37.279 --> 43:39.873
<i>He would have read it the morning
after she caught that red-eye.</i>

43:39.949 --> 43:42.417
<i>It said that she didn't feel
comfortable in the real world...</i>

43:42.485 --> 43:44.385
<i>and that she was
going back to the convent.</i>

43:44.453 --> 43:47.422
<i>Sure, it was a lie, but Rick
would have believed it.</i>

43:47.490 --> 43:50.516
<i>And, in every lie, there's
a little truth, I guess.</i>

43:50.593 --> 43:52.925
<i>I just wondered how much
of it Rick could take.</i>

43:52.995 --> 43:54.292
Hi, guys.

43:54.363 --> 43:55.796
Hey, how'd it go?

43:56.098 --> 43:57.087
Oh.

43:57.600 --> 44:01.559
Carol says it'll take about a
week to clear up the paperwork.

44:01.637 --> 44:03.730
We shouldn't plan
any trips till then.

44:04.640 --> 44:05.800
Did you find out anything?

44:06.041 --> 44:07.235
About Wendy?

44:08.744 --> 44:11.941
Well, as far as the police
can tell, it was an accident.

44:12.014 --> 44:13.606
I mean, she was just
an innocent bystander...

44:13.682 --> 44:15.616
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

44:15.818 --> 44:17.911
But those agents said that-
Yeah, I know.

44:18.721 --> 44:19.949
They were wrong.

44:20.022 --> 44:21.250
So was I, Rick.

44:22.391 --> 44:23.722
Wendy was a good kid.

44:25.161 --> 44:26.856
Those scum.

44:27.930 --> 44:30.455
Those dirty, rotten, scums!

44:31.167 --> 44:33.067
They killed her for nothing.

44:33.135 --> 44:36.263
They killed my sister
for nothing. For nothing!

44:42.111 --> 44:43.510
We got them guys, didn't we?

44:43.579 --> 44:44.910
We got them for what
they did, didn't we?

44:44.980 --> 44:46.641
Yeah. Yeah, Rick,
we got them.

44:46.715 --> 44:48.114
That's right.

45:01.564 --> 45:04.226
I hope you've been practicing
that team of yours.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.426
Team?

45:06.035 --> 45:07.263
Basketball team.

45:07.336 --> 45:09.395
If you want to call it a team.

45:10.372 --> 45:11.361
Hey.

45:12.374 --> 45:14.308
Wait a minute, T.C.

45:14.510 --> 45:16.740
Those guys are good players.
Oh, yeah, yeah...

45:16.812 --> 45:18.712
that's great, if winning's
not important to you.

45:18.781 --> 45:20.271
Well, they may not
win every time.

45:20.349 --> 45:21.543
Every time?

45:21.617 --> 45:23.642
But they've got spirit.
That's what counts.

45:23.719 --> 45:26.449
Well, I'll remind you of that when
my team walks all over yours...

45:26.522 --> 45:27.887
in the game next Saturday.

45:27.957 --> 45:29.754
Oh, come on, T.C.
Hey, Rick!

45:30.459 --> 45:32.427
Rick, what are the odds
on my team?

45:35.531 --> 45:36.964
You're going to
lose by ten points.

45:37.032 --> 45:38.397
Ten?

45:38.467 --> 45:40.094
Where did you get ten?

45:43.072 --> 45:45.199
Right. Maybe 15.

45:45.307 --> 45:46.968
What?
You heard him.

45:47.042 --> 45:48.771
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

45:48.844 --> 45:49.833
We're gonna win.

45:49.912 --> 45:51.607
There is no way...

46:04.260 --> 46:05.625
Guess it didn't work.

46:08.397 --> 46:11.889
Maybe he needs a little time
to think about it.

46:18.507 --> 46:21.101
<i>When Rick came back
he was ready to talk.</i>

46:21.176 --> 46:23.041
<i>T.C. and I stayed up
all night with him.</i>

46:23.112 --> 46:26.047
<i>The sun was coming up
as I drove home.</i>

46:44.166 --> 46:46.396
<i>This dawn marked the
beginning of my fourth day...</i>

46:46.468 --> 46:48.333
<i>without any real sleep.</i>

47:08.390 --> 47:10.517
Morning, Higgins.
