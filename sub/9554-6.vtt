<i>Arthur's gonna miss the

01:29.423 --> 01:30.754
DOCTOR:
Get this prescription filled,

01:30.858 --> 01:32.553
have him take two every day.

01:32.660 --> 01:33.855
Will they help?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.122
They'll relieve the pain, uh,

01:35.229 --> 01:36.560
until the operation takes place.

01:36.664 --> 01:37.927
(Marion gasps)

01:38.032 --> 01:40.797
Well, how much time
has he got left?

01:40.901 --> 01:42.801
Uh... before the operation?

01:42.903 --> 01:44.598
Mr. Cunningham,
there's no more time.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.537
He's got to go
into the hospital tomorrow.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.801
I hope you understand.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.398
Well, thanks
for coming, Doctor.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.671
I'll see about
getting him a bed.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.870
A bed? Yeah, a bed.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.208
He could use a bed.
Yeah.

01:54.548 --> 01:58.712
Oh, Howard, you're so strong
in a time of crisis.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.652
Well, you get that way in the
hardware business, Marion.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.786
Gee, why so serious?

02:07.895 --> 02:09.419
Yeah, what's
the big deal about a guy

02:09.530 --> 02:10.793
getting his tonsils yanked out?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.060
Shh! He's sleeping.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.102
(hoarsely):
I'm not going to the hospital.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.797
And I'm not
having my tonsils out.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.704
Look, Fonzie, I know
what you're going through.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.743
I had my tonsils removed
just three years ago.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.575
Yeah, those were the two
quietest weeks of my life.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.139
Now, look, this is the third
attack you've had this month.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.548
You have got to go
to the hospital.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.587
Fonz, Joanie and I had

02:35.689 --> 02:37.783
our tonsils taken out years ago.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.859
- Yeah. -My throat's just
starting to feel better.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.086
(laughs)

02:41.195 --> 02:42.663
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

02:42.763 --> 02:45.824
Just a little sickroom
levity, you know.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.731
Now is not the time to go...

02:47.835 --> 02:49.496
(squeakily):
I can't talk anymore.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.401
Oh, he lost his voice.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.497
Well, that settles it--
he has definitely got to go in.

02:54.608 --> 02:58.044
Howard is right, Arthur.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.612
-"Good night, Mrs. C."
-"Good night, Mrs. C."

03:02.716 --> 03:05.708
-"Mr. C."
-"Good night, Mr. C," yeah.

03:05.819 --> 03:06.843
-"See you, Shortcake."
- Gee.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.047
-(mouths words)
- He says

03:11.158 --> 03:13.889
- He's not going to the hospital.
-he's not going to the hospital.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.098
Oh, yes, you are!

03:19.533 --> 03:21.433
Let's get one thing straight:

03:21.535 --> 03:24.527
The doctor says that you
have to have those tonsils out

03:24.638 --> 03:26.504
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen,

03:26.607 --> 03:28.871
if I have to
take 'em out myself.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.411
Now, you may not
care about yourself,

03:31.512 --> 03:34.140
but we care about you.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.342
So there is no
Halloween party for you.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.145
Tomorrow you go
to the hospital,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.617
and that's final,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.017
<i>finis,</i>

03:51.999 --> 03:54.434
Well, Fonzie,
this was the only bed available.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.070
Look, it's-it's a cute room.

03:57.171 --> 04:00.072
- Heyyy.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

04:00.174 --> 04:01.664
Well, look at the
bright side, Fonz.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.472
Your inflammation is down,
your voice is normal.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.415
This is normal?

04:18.524 --> 04:19.458
Well, no...

04:19.560 --> 04:22.325
I mean, what is this,
the junior prom?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.761
Fonz, everybody wears those.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.128
It's a sterile gown.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.429
I don't care who designed 'em!

04:30.437 --> 04:33.338
No, see, that means
I-it's germ-free.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.875
- I knew that.
- Oh.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.138
Now, do we have our bathrobe?

04:38.245 --> 04:40.236
No, we don't have our bathrobe.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.315
I got one, it's home.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.384
Well, you can wear
your little leather one.

04:44.484 --> 04:47.215
Now, where are
your little slippers?

04:47.321 --> 04:48.789
With our robe.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.119
Well, then, you'll just

04:51.225 --> 04:52.886
have to keep
your booties on.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.586
No, no, n0,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.595
no one takes my clothes--
get out of here.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.892
Fonz... what about the time

04:57.998 --> 04:59.898
that Sally was up
in your apartment...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.832
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.599
Hey, uh...

05:04.705 --> 05:06.070
when's the main event?

05:06.173 --> 05:08.801
We'll take your tonsils out
first thing in the morning.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.207
Yeah, they're gonna do us all.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.539
If you need anything,
you ring that buzzer.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.982
But only if you
really need me.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.076
Good-bye, kiddies.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.656
- Bye. -Bye.
- Bye.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.848
You know, I don't
understand something.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.891
I like to sleep late,
you know Cunningham?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.654
Why do they always
have operations

05:27.761 --> 05:29.729
so early in the morning?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.821
You know,
that's interesting.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.902
Now...

05:35.002 --> 05:36.800
Just...

05:36.904 --> 05:38.838
just the other day,
in my psychology class,

05:38.939 --> 05:41.601
the professor was saying that
most people can't do anything

05:41.708 --> 05:44.109
until 10:30 in the morning.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.937
Look, Fonz, I'm sorry
that you got to be stuck here

05:48.048 --> 05:50.278
on Halloween, but...
that's just the way it goes.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.352
Look, you're gonna
have a lot of visitors.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.420
I'll see you myself.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.454
Bye, kids.

05:55.555 --> 05:56.545
KIDS:
Bye.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.352
Who's gonna visit me here?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.449
Bozo the Clown?

06:00.560 --> 06:01.550
Hey, we're alone.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.630
Let's play!

06:03.730 --> 06:06.859
(honking)

06:06.967 --> 06:08.162
Hey, kid,

06:08.268 --> 06:09.326
I'm gonna play taps

06:09.436 --> 06:10.870
with that horn pretty soon.

WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Ward...

06:14.441 --> 06:16.466
Hey, mister, you want
to finger paint?

06:16.576 --> 06:18.601
Uh, no, I don't want
to finger paint, I mean,

06:18.712 --> 06:20.202
I might have to scratch my nose.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.907
I'll scratch it for you.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.850

whooshing, crashing)

06:28.956 --> 06:30.890
<i>CHACHV.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.220

I can't wear that.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.698

his tonsils yanked.

You want me
to shoot 'em out, Kemo Sabe?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.699
(imitating roaring engine)

06:47.808 --> 06:48.900
(imitating buzzing airplanes)

06:49.009 --> 06:50.704
Why are you so bugged?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.802
Because these kids

06:52.913 --> 06:56.008
are driving me nutso.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.675
BOY:
Oh, drop it, Fonz.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.548
He}! guys, guys, come here.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.382
Do me a favor:

07:01.488 --> 07:02.512
Give the old-timer a break.

07:02.622 --> 07:03.987
Cool it for a while, all right?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.354
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.257
"Old-timer"?

07:07.361 --> 07:08.590
It worked.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.163
Besides, they understood cool.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.753
Well, I gotta make my rounds.

07:11.865 --> 07:12.991
I'll see you later, Fonz.

07:13.100 --> 07:13.999
Yeah, take it easy.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.626

Dr. Durshlag?

07:15.736 --> 07:16.862
<i>Yes, nurse'?</i>

07:16.970 --> 07:18.199
You're not a doctor.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.171
No, but you should
see me operate.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.638
Wah, wah, wah.

07:25.212 --> 07:28.011
<i>BOY: Hey, we can
play tiddlywinks.</i>

07:28.115 --> 07:32.211
The Fonz does not
play tiddlywinks.

07:32.319 --> 07:37.018
But on the box it says,
"For kids from six to 60."

07:37.124 --> 07:40.094
I'll bet he doesn't want to play
'cause he's stinky at it.

07:40.193 --> 07:42.287
Hey, hey, hey,
I'll show you a tiddle.

07:42.396 --> 07:43.795
I call blue.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.331
I go first. Hah!

07:46.333 --> 07:49.303
All right, all right,

07:49.403 --> 07:50.893
all right, look,
it's all in the thumb.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.768
Now, I'll show you some
action here. (chuckles)

07:52.873 --> 07:54.864
Are you kidding me?
This tiddle will fly.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.102
All right, look,
the wind took it!

07:57.210 --> 07:59.941
There must be a draft in here.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.038
Here we go.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.218
Oh, give me that back.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.412
Give me that back.
Here we go.

08:08.522 --> 08:11.856
(braying laughter)

08:11.958 --> 08:14.757
Hey, Pots, the Fonz
is playing tiddlywinks.

08:14.861 --> 08:16.886
(stuttering laugh)

08:16.997 --> 08:18.522
I'll tiddle your wink, Malph.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.794
RALPH: Tiddle my wink.
(chuckles)

08:20.901 --> 08:22.460
Now, uh, listen, we'll play
later, kids, all right?

08:22.569 --> 08:25.664
- Oh, come on! -Come on!
- Hey, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

08:25.772 --> 08:26.671
I promise we'll play later.

08:26.773 --> 08:27.740
Get over here.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.240
-(Ralph chuckles)
- BOY: Okay, Fonz.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.673
Now, what are you guys
doing here?

08:30.777 --> 08:32.802
Ain't this off
your, uh, trick-or-treat rack?

08:32.913 --> 08:34.176
Yeah, we came to see you.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.807
How do you like
our costumes, Fonz?

08:36.917 --> 08:38.111
(laughter)

08:38.217 --> 08:39.616
I Still got it.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.448
(laughing):
You still got it.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.284
The thunder of hoof beats,

08:43.390 --> 08:45.825
a cloud of dust,
and a hearty Hi-ho...

08:45.926 --> 08:48.987
How could you, Malph?

08:49.096 --> 08:51.030
You pulled the mask
off the Lone Ranger.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.259
-(kids groan) -Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, it's all right,

08:53.366 --> 08:56.666
he's not the real
Lone Ranger, I am.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.636
And don't you forget it, Malph.

08:58.738 --> 09:01.366
Aw, but you're not even
gonna be at the party, Fonz.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.172
And let me tell you
something, little Ralph.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.042
This town ain't big enough
for two masked men.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.082
You just go grow a beard
and go as "Gabby" Hayes.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.548
Right, Fonz.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.380
I got a whole drawer
full of them.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.785
Children, Jingles the Clown
is in the sunroom

09:15.889 --> 09:17.789
and he wants you
to come down right now

09:17.891 --> 09:19.450
-and have a Jingles good time.
- BOY: All right.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.924
- GIRL: Yay!
- NURSE: Come on, hurry.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.392
Hurry!
We don't want to miss him.

09:22.496 --> 09:23.395
BOY:
Okay!

09:23.497 --> 09:25.295
Aren't you coming, Arthur?

09:28.135 --> 09:31.127
He's got Tinkertoys.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.104
Tinkertoys?

09:33.206 --> 09:36.107
Pots, forget the Tinkertoys.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.574
It's party time.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.906
Oh, yeah, party time.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.411
Oh, oh, Fonz,
it's a little party.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.278
You're not going to miss
anything good, really.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.077
Yeah, we never
make out that well, Fonz.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.084
Yeah, that's a good reason
for you not to go,

09:46.186 --> 09:48.177
now give me a good reason
why I shouldn't go.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.950
Gosh, I tell you something,
what a waste.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.991
You're gonna have a great time
dancing and everything.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.892
Sophia's gonna be there
all by herself.

09:55.996 --> 09:56.963
Oh, not for long, Fonz.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.121
There'll be
plenty of guys there...

09:58.231 --> 09:59.790
(laughs)
Pot... Pots, Pots...

09:59.900 --> 10:01.698
RALPH (chuckling nervously):
No...

10:01.801 --> 10:04.065
Fonz, you see, he means there's
gonna be plenty of guys who...

10:04.171 --> 10:05.935
who'll bring her punch, make
sure that she's having a good--

10:06.039 --> 10:07.200
No, Fonz, I mean there's gonna
be plenty of guys

10:07.307 --> 10:09.708
-that are gonna come up to her--
- Pots, Pots, Pots!

10:09.809 --> 10:11.368
Little devil.
Come on, little devil.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.139
- We'll be late.
- Yeah.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.204
Pots, where you going?

10:15.315 --> 10:17.010
The elevator's down here.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.881
I wanted to look at
some of the Tinkertoys.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.511
- Will you come on?
- Hey, you're bending my fork.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.861
(moans)

10:30.964 --> 10:31.988
(bell dings)

10:32.098 --> 10:34.726
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Dr. Hines. Dr. Hines.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.038
I don't have to worry.

10:41.141 --> 10:45.635
I know that Sophia
is very loyal to her masked man.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.143
(humming the
"William Tell Overture")

10:52.252 --> 10:54.983
How can they have
a Halloween party

10:55.088 --> 10:57.079
without the Lone Ranger?

11:04.698 --> 11:05.563
HOWARD:
That was a great idea,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.030
<i>borrowing these costumes from</i>

11:07.133 --> 11:09.158
the college theater department
for the Halloween party.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.794
<i>RICHIE:
Thanks, Dad. I love mine.</i>

11:10.904 --> 11:12.394
<i>En garde!</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:14.234
Take that, you swine.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.934
Hah! You fight like a chair.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.032
(Blink)

11:17.143 --> 11:18.975
Oh. Wearing armor, huh?

11:19.079 --> 11:22.208
Well, I'm all set, Cyrano.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.050
King Henry VIII
has his turkey leg.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.417
(doorbell rings)

11:29.522 --> 11:31.422
The king will answer the door.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.892
Hi, mister.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.022
Well, young lady, if you're
looking for a pajama party,

11:39.132 --> 11:40.361
you've come to the wrong house.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.400
Trick or treat.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.095
You go trick-or-treating
in pajamas?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.296
This is a costume.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.339
I'm dressed
as a middle-class housewife.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.472
Cute.

11:50.577 --> 11:51.703
Well, how about it?

11:51.811 --> 11:54.178
Do I get a treat,
or do you get a trick?

11:54.281 --> 11:55.806
Well, that's a nice costume.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.349
I think you do deserve a treat.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.918
- Let's...
- I'll take this. Thanks.

11:59.019 --> 11:59.986
No! Wait!

12:00.086 --> 12:02.418
Did you see...?
She took my turkey leg!

12:02.522 --> 12:05.583
Now how am I gonna
be King Henry?

12:05.692 --> 12:07.490
Well, I-l guess you'll
just have to be...

12:07.594 --> 12:09.585
King Kong. (laughs)

12:14.934 --> 12:18.336
I don't need jokes, Cyrano,
I need a turkey leg.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.634
Okay, why... why don't you check
in the refrigerator, Dad.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.334
L-I think I saw something in
there wrapped in aluminum foil.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.413
Everything in there is wrapped
in aluminum foil.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.815
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.751
Who's the fairest of them all?

12:34.854 --> 12:37.084
Joanie, you look beautiful.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.214
Oh, you look great, too, Dad,

12:38.325 --> 12:40.521
except your pillow
is a little crooked.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.552
I'm not wearing a pillow.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.399
Better watch it, Snow White,

12:48.501 --> 12:50.026
or you'll be sent up
to your dungeon.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.262
(laughs)

12:51.371 --> 12:54.238
I'm really gonna be hot
at the party tonight.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.866
Who are you?

12:55.975 --> 12:56.942
I'm your brother.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.910
(laughing):
Sizzling, sizzling hot.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.742
No, no, I'm Cyrano de Bergerac.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.282
Can't you see the no...

13:03.383 --> 13:04.817
Oh, I forgot the nose.
All right, I'll be right back.

13:04.918 --> 13:06.477
-(doorbell rings)
- Get that, Snow White.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.054
Okay.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.885
(evil laughter)

13:10.990 --> 13:12.754
- Guess who.
-(Joanie chuckles)

13:12.859 --> 13:13.758
Hi, Al.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.954
Oh, you guessed me.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.798
I should've worn
my Shirley Temple outfit.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.266
Where's Chachi?

13:23.370 --> 13:24.428
- He's right outside.
- Oh.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.595
You know, he's Fonzie's cousin.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.867
- He likes to make an entrance.
- Oh...

13:27.974 --> 13:29.135
Okay, Chach!

13:29.242 --> 13:30.801
♪ Ta-da! ♪

13:36.216 --> 13:39.914
Ah, Snow White,
you're a vision of loveliness.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.851
You and me, later.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.120
Well, well,
the eighth dwarf-- Pushy.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.293
No, I'm Prince Charming.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.591
(car horn honks)

13:50.697 --> 13:52.461
Wait a second!

13:52.565 --> 13:54.055
We're going
with Jenny Piccalo's folks.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.931
Oh, I can hardly wait
to see her costume.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.663
She's going dressed
as Lady Godiva.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.866
Lady Godiva.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.533
Wah, wah, wah.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.474
This way, Snow White.

14:04.577 --> 14:06.568
No way, Prince Squirt.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.148
Richard, there is no turkey leg
in there, just meatloaf!

14:12.252 --> 14:14.721
Now, what king carries meatloaf?

14:16.022 --> 14:16.989
Boo!

14:17.090 --> 14:18.558
Hi, Al.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.721
Hey, you recognized me.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.263
I know what-- it's the shoes.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.332
You recognized the shoes, right?

14:30.403 --> 14:31.962
My king.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.699
Anne Boleyn, my lovely queen.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.970
Oh, sire, you're so romantic.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.704
<i>Gunning)</i>

14:40.747 --> 14:42.044
(grunts)

14:42.749 --> 14:45.184
Well, what do you think?

14:45.285 --> 14:46.650
Huh? You like it?

14:46.753 --> 14:49.085
- It looks nice. (chuckles)
- Oh, thanks.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.788
Rich... tonight...

14:53.893 --> 14:56.453
try not to stand
next to me, okay?

14:56.563 --> 15:00.056
Well, look, as soon as Fonzie's
girl comes, we can leave, huh?

15:00.166 --> 15:01.065
Oh, Ralph called.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.601
He's so sweet.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.364
He volunteered to pick her up
and bring her to the party.

15:05.472 --> 15:06.371
Oh, yeah, volunteered.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.963
So sweet. (chuckles)

15:08.074 --> 15:10.168
All right then, let's go.
Come on.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.412
That's right, it's me.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.038
Let's not make
a federal case out of it, huh?

15:15.148 --> 15:17.048
I'm here.
Where's Sophia?

15:17.150 --> 15:18.140
Hi, Al.

15:19.152 --> 15:21.052
That does it.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.454
I'm going home
and change my shoes.

15:24.557 --> 15:25.683
Arthur, what are you doing here?

15:25.792 --> 15:26.884
RICHIE:
You're sick, Fonz.

15:26.993 --> 15:28.256
You've got no clothes
under your coat.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.886
- You were at the hospital...
- Look, I am not going back

15:29.996 --> 15:32.465
to the hospital,
I'm going to the party.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.727
I'll go back tomorrow morning,
first thing.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.201
You are going back
to the hospital tonight.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.634
(doorbell rings)

15:39.873 --> 15:40.738
There they are now.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.330
The doctor came for you.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.139
You brought it on yourself!

15:46.412 --> 15:48.847
Oh, what cute children.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.713
You're dressed
as little hospital patients.

15:51.818 --> 15:54.378
Mom, they are
little hospital patients.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.080
They're from Fonzie's room.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.623
Stool pigeon.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.853
Will you get over here?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.359
Hey, Fonz.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.624
How did you
and why are you here?

16:04.731 --> 16:05.823
They must've followed you.

16:05.932 --> 16:06.922
How'd you get out
of the hospital?

16:07.033 --> 16:08.057
It was easy.

16:08.167 --> 16:08.929
They're on strike.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.469
We snuck.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.470
Let me ask you a question.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.006
How can you run around like this
at nighttime?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.597
You know, you could get sick.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.642
We're already sick.

16:17.744 --> 16:18.905
Oh, that's great.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.413
I'm surrounded
by wise-guy munchkins.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.074
Well, I hope you're happy now.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.651
You sure set some example.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.914
Now, we got to get these kids
back to the hospital.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.580
- Richie, you bring Fonzie back.
- Right.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.124
Come on, children, off to the
hospital-- now, bundle up.

16:32.225 --> 16:34.250
GIRL:
Some Halloween!

16:34.360 --> 16:36.590
HOWARD:
Let's go, everybody!

16:36.696 --> 16:39.791
How come the guy with the pillow
is so grumpy?

16:39.899 --> 16:42.300
I am not wearing a pillow!

16:48.675 --> 16:50.769
But you are
a little grumpy, dear.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.436
Well, why shouldn't I be grumpy?

16:52.545 --> 16:54.377
I got to take three kids back
to the hospital,

16:54.480 --> 16:57.541
a ten-year-old housewife
took my turkey leg

16:57.650 --> 17:02.212
and, Marion, these tights
are strangling me.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.484
You really did it tonight, Fonz.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.080
A mass breakout.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.990
Come on. I'll take you back
to the hospital.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.256
I'm not going back
to the hospital.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.763
Now, just lay off.
I don't feel so hot anyway.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.128
I'm gonna wait here for Sophia.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.223
Ralph took her.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.734
Well, then,
I'm gonna un-take her.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.531
No, now, wait,
I want to say something.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.133
Fonz, I just want
to tell you something, okay?

17:23.242 --> 17:24.800
Make it fast.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.539
Now, listen, you-you're sick.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.741
Do you know you could lose
your voice permanently?

17:29.849 --> 17:32.113
Now, I want you to think
about that, Fonz.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.209
Because how would you look
going...

17:37.156 --> 17:39.056
It is Halloween.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.991
I don't want to be in bed,
cooped up, sick.

17:42.095 --> 17:43.722
Well, you have no say
in the matter.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.389
You can't control
when you're sick.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.262
You can get mumps
on your birthday,

17:47.367 --> 17:48.857
you can get measles
on Thanksgiving

17:48.968 --> 17:50.527
or y-you could get, uh...

17:50.637 --> 17:53.004
I know--
and tonsils on Halloween.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.074
That's right.
That's the way life is.

17:55.174 --> 17:59.042
But why on Halloween?

18:00.413 --> 18:01.778
You're right, Cunningham.

18:01.881 --> 18:04.543
Take me back to the hospital.

18:04.651 --> 18:07.518
<i>BOY:
Happy Halloween.</i>

18:07.620 --> 18:09.748
FONZIE:
It's not my fault.

18:09.856 --> 18:12.621
Fonz, boy, are you a drag.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.753
Hey, look, I mean,
this is our Halloween.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.262
You know, there's not much
we can do about it.

18:18.364 --> 18:22.699
You know, you can't choose
when you're gonna be sick.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.201
That's easy for you to say.

18:24.303 --> 18:26.567
This is probably
your 50th Halloween!

18:26.673 --> 18:28.334
Heyyy...

18:29.842 --> 18:33.107
Yeah, it's only the third one
I can remember.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.771
All right, all right,
I don't know what to do.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.849
I mean, I'm not used
to being with, you know,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.474
people your height.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.616
Boy, are you a drag.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.351
I am not a drag!

18:46.392 --> 18:49.089
Now, uh,
why the long faces, huh?

18:49.195 --> 18:51.630
I mean, we should be happy here,
have some fun.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.221
All right, everybody,
off your beds.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.562
Grab your bags,
get your masks on, let's go.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.568
We're going trick-or-treating.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.866
You can't trick-or-treat
in the hospital.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.462
Let me tell you something,
Russell, where there's a door,

19:01.574 --> 19:03.064
there's a trick or treat.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.076
Now, just put your mask on,
you ninny-- let's go.

19:05.178 --> 19:08.443
We're gonna go to
the X-ray room, we're gonna go

19:08.548 --> 19:11.040
to the doctors' room,
we're going to patients' rooms,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.812
we're gonna go
to the nurses' room...

19:17.757 --> 19:19.657
Boy, that was neat, Fonz.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.922
Yeah, best
trick-or-treat stuff ever.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.895
Band-Aids...

19:24.997 --> 19:26.590
cotton balls...

19:26.699 --> 19:28.861
Look at this, an ah-stick.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.561
Ah...

19:30.670 --> 19:34.903
Poor Fonzie, all you got
is nurses' telephone numbers.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.843
Oh, yeah, that's my tough luck.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.710
But I'll tell you something,
the evening is young, you know.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.306
I mean, you can't have a
Halloween without a ghost story.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.044
- You want to be scared?
- KIDS: Yeah!

19:46.152 --> 19:48.484
All right, we'll all meet
on Allison's bed. Let's go.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.147
Let's go. Here we go.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.020
Up there, up there.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.560
All right, now listen up.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.096
Listen
to the Lone Ghost Story Teller.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.632
- I love ghost stories.
- RUSSELL: Yeah, me, too.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.634
All right, because this is
a very scary story.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.966
And here we go.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.972
Once upon a time...

20:08.074 --> 20:10.304
They all start that way.

20:10.409 --> 20:13.504
What are you, a wise guy?

20:13.613 --> 20:17.243
Once upon a midnight dreary...

20:17.350 --> 20:19.910
(cackles)

20:20.019 --> 20:24.115
Once upon a midnight dreary,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.590
there were three little kidlets,

20:26.692 --> 20:29.093
and their names
just happened to be,

20:29.195 --> 20:31.493
Patrick, Russell and Allison.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.827
And they were stuck
in the woods.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.799
And all of a sudden...

20:35.902 --> 20:37.461
(imitating a rainstorm)

20:37.570 --> 20:40.039
...a rainstorm started,

20:40.139 --> 20:42.631
and the trees were dripping
with wet.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.972
And I want to tell you
that in the distance

20:45.077 --> 20:49.310
they saw this dark, eerie
abandoned house.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.975
And Patrick said,
"Hey, let's go over there

20:52.084 --> 20:54.985
to that dark, eerie
abandoned house."

20:55.087 --> 20:56.316
And they did.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.823
They ran through the mud
and the slush.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.689
And they got up
to that house and they walked up

21:00.793 --> 21:02.887
the crickety porch,

21:02.995 --> 21:05.828
and they opened up
the creaky door...

21:05.932 --> 21:07.923
(imitates creaking door)

21:11.137 --> 21:13.697
...and a bat flew out!

21:13.806 --> 21:17.242
And then, all of a sudden,
they heard this strange noise.

21:17.343 --> 21:20.643
(Screaming):
"Help...!

21:20.746 --> 21:23.977
(high-pitched):
"if this log rolls over,

21:24.083 --> 21:25.551
"we'll drown.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.745
We'll drown."

21:27.854 --> 21:30.949
I want to tell you,
they shook in their boots.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.617
It was pitch dark.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.887
(kids gasp)

21:34.994 --> 21:36.826
And they started
to walk up the staircase.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.227
At the end of the staircase
was this room.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.733
And they opened up the door.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.825
(imitates creaking door)

21:46.405 --> 21:49.705
And all of a sudden,
they heard the sound again.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.245
(high-Pitched):
"Help...!

21:53.346 --> 21:56.907
(grumbly voice):
"if this log rolls over,

21:57.016 --> 21:59.451
"we'll drown.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.249
"If this log rolls over,

22:02.355 --> 22:05.723
we'll drown."

22:05.825 --> 22:07.725
Well, I want to tell you,

22:07.827 --> 22:12.060
Patrick took out his flashlight,

22:12.164 --> 22:14.997
and he looked across the room,

22:15.101 --> 22:18.833
and he saw a sink
filled up with water.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.669
And he looked in the middle
of that sink,

22:21.774 --> 22:24.869
and standing there,
on a floating toothpick,

22:24.977 --> 22:27.207
was this little ant.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.748
And that ant was talking
to his friend,

22:29.849 --> 22:31.749
another little ant, and he said,

22:31.851 --> 22:33.615
"Help! Help!

22:33.719 --> 22:35.778
"If this log rolls over,
we'll drown!

22:35.888 --> 22:37.356
We'll drown!"

22:46.499 --> 22:48.263
Hey, what's the matter here?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.597
- That was neat, Fonzie.
- Yeah?

22:50.703 --> 22:53.195
Look at that.
The boys are scared stiff.

22:53.306 --> 22:54.330
Scared?

22:54.440 --> 22:56.135
Nah, we're just cold.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.471
FONZIE:
Uh-huh.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.010
All right, that's our Halloween.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.806
Now get over there,
go to your beds.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.506
Thanks for
a nice Halloween, Fonz.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.810
Yeah, you, too.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.384
Fonz, you're not a drag.

23:05.484 --> 23:06.781
Heyyy.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.285
An ant on a toothpick?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.048
Get over there.

23:12.325 --> 23:14.225
Have a nice operation, Fonz.

23:14.327 --> 23:17.558
Well, you have a nice operation
your little self, huh?

23:17.663 --> 23:20.894
- I'm glad you were sick with me.
- Mm.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.832
All right.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.404
Everybody in their beds?
Get in there.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.732
All right.

23:33.279 --> 23:35.270
Nurses station?

23:37.650 --> 23:41.280
All right, I'll see, uh,
Ellen, Barbara...

23:41.387 --> 23:44.357
At 11:00, I'll have Debbie come
in here for a massage.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.448
That Fonzie.

23:47.593 --> 23:48.856
Uh, in case you forgot,

23:48.961 --> 23:51.396
this is room 307, the Fonz.

23:51.497 --> 23:53.591
Heyyy.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.342
Oh, Marion, that dinner
was just delicious.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.349
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.350
Arthur must be all better.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.681
He ate everything on his plate.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.414
I'll tell you something,
Mrs. C., I feel terrific.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.513
What is for dessert?

24:18.624 --> 24:19.955
Everybody's favorite...

24:20.059 --> 24:21.185
- Lemon tart! -Chocolate cake!
- Strawberry shortcake?

24:21.293 --> 24:22.192
RICHIE:
Chocolate sundae!

24:22.294 --> 24:25.127
-...pumpkin pie!
-(everyone groaning)

24:25.231 --> 24:27.063
We've been having pumpkin
all week.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.396
Pumpkin pie, pumpkin cookies,
pumpkin ice cream,

24:29.502 --> 24:32.301
pumpkin pudding...
I've had pumpkin up to here.

24:32.405 --> 24:33.497
I've had so many pumpkins,

24:33.606 --> 24:36.098
I feel like I should put
a candle in my mouth.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.939
How was I to know that the prize
for best costume

24:39.045 --> 24:41.104
was 50 pumpkins?

24:42.214 --> 24:44.945
Oh, Howard,
