01:07.442 --> 01:11.738
I got this for "most RV sales
during an oil crisis".

01:11.821 --> 01:15.575
Well, you've certainty accomplished a lot
since high school.

01:15.658 --> 01:17.202
Now, I've got just got to go--

01:17.285 --> 01:18.620
Oh, wait, wait! I've got
something even better!

01:18.703 --> 01:22.123
But I only need one award
for the reunion banquet.

01:22.207 --> 01:26.753
Ready? I'm buildin' the world's
tallest skateboard ramp!

01:26.836 --> 01:28.838
Oh great! Well we'll run with that one!

01:28.922 --> 01:30.256
Now I've gotta go interview Goofy.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.424
For what?

01:31.508 --> 01:33.426
His achievements since high school.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.970
[laughs] That'll be a short meeting!

01:39.474 --> 01:41.476
Dad, too cool!

01:41.559 --> 01:43.645
You were on the basketball team?

01:43.728 --> 01:48.066
Oh, naw. Fell out of the stands. Ah-hyuck!

01:48.149 --> 01:49.359
Oh.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.820
Oh, how about the swim team?

01:51.903 --> 01:53.488
Nope.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.990
Hey, looky there, Max.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.827
You look just like me!

01:58.910 --> 02:00.286
I don't think so, Dad.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.123
-Football?
-Uh-uh.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.792
Ah-hyuck! Thought I'd lost this!

02:10.338 --> 02:13.842
Hey, my high-school sweater!

02:13.925 --> 02:16.052
I'll wear it to the reunion.

02:18.513 --> 02:20.974
Max, get that?

02:23.226 --> 02:27.439
Max? Hold on! Here I come.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.691
[screams]

02:32.027 --> 02:35.447
Ah-hyuck! Wanda Jean Schmettzer.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.366
Ah-hyuck! I haven't seen
you since graduation.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.868
Or was it yesterday?

02:39.951 --> 02:42.620
Oh, hello, Goofy.

02:50.003 --> 02:53.256
Oh, you must be Goofy Jr.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.092
And don't you look
exactly like your dad!

02:57.761 --> 02:59.679
[Goofy] Yep! That's my boy!

03:02.182 --> 03:04.142
We're like two peas in a pod,

03:04.225 --> 03:07.604
two, uh, flies on-- huh? On a hotdog,

03:07.687 --> 03:09.981
two warts on a pickle.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.649
Two strikes and you're out.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.109
[Wanda Jean] Goofy,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.862
we want everyone at the reunion
to get an award.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.615
So tell me what you've done
since graduation.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.329
I had my diploma framed.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.498
-[uneasy laughter]
-I'm looking for something

03:26.581 --> 03:30.377
a little more, say,
out of the ordinary.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.631
Oh! Well, I got a job,
a cat, and my boy here!

03:34.714 --> 03:37.884
No, Dad, she means something exciting,

03:37.967 --> 03:39.803
unique, amazing!

03:39.886 --> 03:41.763
Oh, I get it.

03:41.846 --> 03:44.808
Well, I once threw waffles in the trash

03:44.891 --> 03:47.936
and had to rescue her
from the garbage truck.

03:48.019 --> 03:51.147
Had to run way over to the city dump...

03:51.231 --> 03:52.941
-You know, I just--
-...in just undershorts.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.401
That's not really--

03:54.484 --> 03:55.485
-If you just...
-Wouldn't have been so bad,

03:55.568 --> 03:57.987
but I stepped in a tub of rancid oleo

03:58.071 --> 04:01.199
and had to have it surgically
removed by a doctor

04:01.282 --> 04:02.200
-with a clothespin on his nose.
-Here, Max.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.619
If he comes up with something
in the next few days,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.329
-fill this out.
-Check.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.789
She's gone, Dad.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.292
Oh.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.462
An award would be cool!
You should go for it!

04:14.546 --> 04:17.340
Oh, I don't wanna do
any wild stunts, Max.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.386
Folks will think I'm crazy! Whoa!

04:23.930 --> 04:25.598
-[P.J.] I'm telling you, you do so!
-[Max] Do not!

04:25.682 --> 04:27.100
You don't know what you're talking about.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.893
-[P.J.] You do so, man!
-[Max] You need glasses!

04:28.977 --> 04:31.229
I can't believe you don't see it, Max!

04:31.312 --> 04:33.314
You look just like your dad!

04:33.398 --> 04:35.400
-Uh, I got an idea, toadstool.
-What?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.819
You promise not to say that again,

04:37.902 --> 04:41.072
and I promise not
to rearrange your earlobes.

04:41.156 --> 04:45.076
Say, what? You look just like your dad?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.787
Death! That's it!

04:49.664 --> 04:50.999
But you do!

04:53.460 --> 04:56.796
Peej, let's try this
one last time, OK?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.631
Look at these ears.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.550
Nothin' like my dad's!

05:00.633 --> 05:03.553
Hey, look at my hair!
Ditto! My chin, my eyes!

05:03.636 --> 05:05.347
Totally, totally different!

05:05.430 --> 05:08.350
P.J., I'm nothing like my dad!

05:11.102 --> 05:12.687
[screaming]

05:12.771 --> 05:15.899
[laughs] Yeah! Right, Max-o.

05:15.982 --> 05:19.861
You and your dad even fall alike!
[laughs]

05:19.944 --> 05:22.364
Cork it, P.J.!

05:22.447 --> 05:24.032
[P.J. laughing]

05:27.160 --> 05:29.454
OK! OK! Truce, man!

05:33.124 --> 05:36.503
So you gonna teach me that
50/50 axle grind or what?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.214
-Think you can handle it?
-Try me.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.299
Follow, if you can!

05:41.383 --> 05:42.550
You're on.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.060
Aah!

05:52.519 --> 05:56.314
Looks like a 50/50
nose grind to me, Peej.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.358
[grunts] I don't know, Max.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.652
Maybe my center of gravity
is too high, huh?

06:00.735 --> 06:03.113
Naw, it's this junky old ramp, P.J.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.322
We need a bigger one!

06:04.406 --> 06:07.409
Like your dad's!

06:09.786 --> 06:12.706
Wow! Now that's a ramp!

06:12.789 --> 06:15.083
[P.J.] And it's not even finished yet!

06:15.166 --> 06:17.836
My dad's building it for that
big sales thing, you know,

06:17.919 --> 06:20.422
with slammer McTwist.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.340
Man, if we had a half-pipe like that,

06:22.424 --> 06:24.759
we'd get even more speed, and then we'd--

06:24.843 --> 06:26.094
Kill ourselves?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.055
Let's try it out.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.390
Yeah, but my dad--

06:30.473 --> 06:32.559
Ah, we won't hurt anything, Peej.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.643
Come on.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.899
Come on, Peej. I'll beat you to the top!

06:46.906 --> 06:49.284
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

06:49.367 --> 06:51.161
I don't know. I still like something

06:51.244 --> 06:54.164
a little more low-risk, like sleeping.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.250
Watch this! Over the top.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.168
Oh!

06:59.419 --> 07:02.339
Just what in the wide,
wide world of sports

07:02.422 --> 07:03.715
do you think you're doin'?

07:03.798 --> 07:05.300
Uh, as you know, sir,

07:05.383 --> 07:08.470
physical dexterity is very
important to today's youth,

07:08.553 --> 07:11.056
so we were just improving
our coordination skills.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.599
Oh, really?

07:12.682 --> 07:15.185
Well, I'll improve your dexterity for ya!

07:15.268 --> 07:17.437
You two stay off this thing, see?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.938
-Oh, yes, sir! [stammering]
-Understood, Sir!

07:19.022 --> 07:20.357
Absolutely!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.776
This is the biggest stunt
I ever cooked up.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.236
Customers will come from miles around.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.906
So I don't want anybody
messing with my ramp,

07:27.989 --> 07:30.408
and that means you! Whoa!

07:33.078 --> 07:34.120
Yipes!

07:36.081 --> 07:36.998
Beat it, kid!

07:37.082 --> 07:39.542
You're just a carbon copy
of your old man anyway.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.835
A goof!

07:47.300 --> 07:48.760
[Goofy] Not hungry, Max?

07:49.761 --> 07:52.931
I made your favorite, ketchup spaghetti!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.643
Wanna talk about it?

07:56.726 --> 07:58.228
Talk about what?

07:58.770 --> 08:01.147
Whatever it is that got ya so down.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.652
Well, if someone said
you always goofed things up,

08:05.735 --> 08:06.736
what would you do?

08:08.196 --> 08:10.156
Well, I usually do goof things up!

08:10.240 --> 08:12.909
But, say you weren't related
to that person?

08:12.992 --> 08:15.161
[sucking]

08:15.245 --> 08:16.830
It wouldn't bother me.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.164
But if it did bother you--

08:18.248 --> 08:20.834
wait a minute, Max.
What're you gettin' at?

08:20.917 --> 08:24.796
Pete! He said you're a goof
and I'm just like you!

08:24.879 --> 08:25.797
Oh.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.884
I know! I'm gonna do something
to make ya proud of me!

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
Like what?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.721
Something wonderful,

08:32.804 --> 08:34.681
unique, exciting!

08:34.764 --> 08:37.851
I'm gonna win me one of them awards!

08:44.149 --> 08:46.568
[Max] This is gonna cinch it, Dad!

08:46.651 --> 08:49.404
Just don't lose your balance!

08:49.487 --> 08:51.239
I'll get Wanda Jean,

08:51.322 --> 08:53.908
and when I give you the sign, go!

08:53.992 --> 08:55.744
You got it, coach!

08:58.079 --> 08:58.997
[panting]

08:59.080 --> 09:00.665
Look, Mrs Schmettzer!

09:00.749 --> 09:04.044
First running long-jump on stilts.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.224
Sorry.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.143
Don't go away! We'll be back!

09:20.685 --> 09:22.854
Ah-hyuck! How was that?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.316
This will do it for sure, Dad.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.234
The first alumni to walk on water.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.904
Ah-hyuck! Kind of squishy!

09:30.987 --> 09:33.198
Be right back with Wanda Jean!

10:10.068 --> 10:13.154
Yikes! Help. [glugging]

10:16.908 --> 10:18.243
Never mind.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.974
Nice try.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.434
[Goofy, muffled] Thanks.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.573
Max, I'm not gonna get that award now.

11:38.656 --> 11:42.327
Hey! At least you tried!
That's what you tell me.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.245
Oh, I feel like I let ya down.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.998
There's only one cure
for a case like this.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.959
A triple pepperoni-pineapple pizza!

11:50.043 --> 11:51.461
Naw.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.047
With those little fishies on it?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.215
[cars honking]

11:55.298 --> 11:57.258
[Goofy] I hope this
isn't a line for pizza!

11:58.385 --> 11:59.678

12:01.596 --> 12:04.307
[Pete] Now, don't shove, folks!

12:04.391 --> 12:07.310
Slammer McTwist will be out
in just a minute!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.604
Oh, I forgot!

12:09.688 --> 12:12.107
Dad? Can we rain check the pizza?

12:12.190 --> 12:14.067
I've got to see the show!

12:14.150 --> 12:17.070
[all] Slammer! Slammer! Slammer!

12:17.153 --> 12:20.990
All right, all right!
You asked for him, you got him!

13:13.335 --> 13:17.005
by skating down the world's tallest ramp,

13:17.088 --> 13:19.841
built and owned by yours truly, thank you.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.428
Whoa. That's the ramp? No way, dude.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.975
Now look here, you little punk.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.686
I built this ramp,
and you're going down it, see?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.146
Forget you, man.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.398
Oh, but, Slammer, baby!

13:35.482 --> 13:38.902
It's unique! Exciting!
No one's ever done it before!

13:38.985 --> 13:42.739
[Slammer] Hey, there's no one crazy enough
to run that ramp!

13:42.822 --> 13:43.907
I'll do it!

13:44.491 --> 13:45.658
You?

13:45.742 --> 13:46.993
Dad!

13:47.077 --> 13:48.661
[chatter]

13:52.082 --> 13:55.710
OK, Dad. You just roll off like this.

13:55.794 --> 13:56.961
Yeah.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.923
Now alley-oop to turn back around.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.717
Ah-hyuck! Got it!

14:07.681 --> 14:09.099
[screaming]

14:11.017 --> 14:13.061
Better try something simpler.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.232
Now, just steer around the obstacles, Dad.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.110
[gulps] What do you mean steer?

14:22.946 --> 14:26.783
I don't know, maybe we could
try training wheels.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.368
Whoa!

14:34.958 --> 14:36.292
Whoa!

14:37.794 --> 14:41.881
OK, Dad, let's try
just standing on the board.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.553
Well, shucks, that's easy!

14:47.929 --> 14:50.598
Whoa! [screaming]

14:53.643 --> 14:54.936
Poor Dad.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.148
Well, at least now you won't
have to do that stunt.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.864
[coughs]

15:05.947 --> 15:08.825
What am I doin' here?
I got a show to do!

15:17.083 --> 15:19.252
My public awaits!

[crash]

15:23.089 --> 15:24.174
Dad?

15:25.717 --> 15:27.218
What makes you think he's here, Max?

15:27.302 --> 15:29.304
Well, where else would he go, Peej? Hurry!

15:31.723 --> 15:33.808
Uh-oh! Too late!

15:33.892 --> 15:35.352
-Dad!
-Mr. G.!

15:36.811 --> 15:38.188
Whoa! [screaming]

15:42.692 --> 15:44.986
Dad's gone ballistic!

15:47.572 --> 15:50.116
What if he wakes up
and wants to do it again?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.494
Leave it to old Maxie.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.247
But what about the stunt, Max?

15:56.373 --> 15:58.249
-Oh, yeah. [gasps]

15:58.375 --> 16:00.794
Not to worry, Peej. We're gonna do it!

16:00.919 --> 16:04.673
-What?
-I said we're gonna do it!

16:04.756 --> 16:07.634
But who'll believe we're your dad?

16:07.717 --> 16:12.347
Everyone. After all, I look just like him!

16:14.683 --> 16:17.852
[Pete] We'll bend over backwards!
We'll do cartwheels!

16:17.936 --> 16:19.521
We'll go the extra mile...

16:20.230 --> 16:21.606
Catch up, Peej!

16:21.690 --> 16:23.316
[P.J.] But I can't see!

16:23.400 --> 16:24.859
You don't want to.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.736
[crowd] Goof! Goof! Goof! Goof!

16:26.820 --> 16:30.115
Goof! Goof! Goof!
Goof! Goof! Goof!

16:30.198 --> 16:31.700
[P.J.] I'm feelin' faint.

16:31.783 --> 16:34.035
Relax, P.J.! We're gonna pull this off.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.830
Whoa!

16:37.580 --> 16:40.291
[P.J.] Oh, man. I'm gonna throw up.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.210
I know I'm gonna throw up!

16:42.293 --> 16:45.588
[Goofy, knocking on door]
Hey! Let me out of here!

16:45.714 --> 16:46.840
Mr. Goofy?

16:46.965 --> 16:50.218
[Goofy] Pistol? Open the door, sweetie!

16:50.301 --> 16:52.470
[stammering]
But how can you be in there

16:52.554 --> 16:54.597
and be on my daddy's ramp
at the same time,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.099
um, explain that, will you, please?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.642
[Goofy] I'm not up there!

16:57.767 --> 16:59.894
Um, well, it sure looks like you.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.521
Gee whiz! He's got your sweater,

17:01.604 --> 17:03.023
which is a little bit baggy,
by the way, and--

17:03.106 --> 17:04.899
Oh, no! Max!

17:06.651 --> 17:07.652
[grunts]

17:07.777 --> 17:11.614
And now, go-for-it goof will attempt

17:11.698 --> 17:16.161
to ride the tallest
skateboard ramp in history! Go!

17:16.286 --> 17:19.831
Here I come! [forced chuckle]

17:19.914 --> 17:23.209
[P.J.] Forget it, Max.
I've changed my mind.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.628
Come on, Peej! My dad risked his neck

17:25.712 --> 17:27.505
to win that award for me.
I've got to help him.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.674
Yeah, but, Max, if you do the stunt,

17:29.758 --> 17:32.052
it'll be your award, not his!

17:32.260 --> 17:34.763
You're right! This is all bogus!

17:34.888 --> 17:36.931
[P.J.] Yeah. So let's call it off, OK?

17:37.015 --> 17:39.100
-[Max] I'm with you, dude.
-[P.J. sighs]

17:39.225 --> 17:41.227
Uh, P.J., we're gonna have to continue

17:41.311 --> 17:42.604
this conversation later.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.357
-[P.J.] Why?
-[both screaming]

17:45.774 --> 17:46.733
[crowd gasping]

17:54.574 --> 17:56.159
We did it, Max!

17:56.242 --> 17:58.119
Yeah! We did.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.873
[both] One more time!

18:08.713 --> 18:10.799
All right!

I'll wear my seat belt!

18:56.136 --> 18:59.180
50/50 axle grind, P.J.!
I knew you could do it.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.306
[screams]

19:02.642 --> 19:05.395
Uh-oh! Backside alley-oop, Peej!

19:13.445 --> 19:14.821
Awesome!

19:18.992 --> 19:20.452

20:35.151 --> 20:36.778
That's worth an award any day!

Really?

Oh, dear. Now I can't
give you that award.

I'm sorry, Dad.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.638
I'm sorry, son.

21:06.141 --> 21:07.559
You're sorry?

Oh, ain't that sweet?

Not just because he'd do
anything for his son,

would do anything for him.
