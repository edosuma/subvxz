00:34.783 --> 00:36.986
<i>When telling
the story of our people,</i>

00:37.618 --> 00:41.323
<i>it's impossible to separate</i>
the truth from the myth.

00:51.466 --> 00:54.469
<i>Our story begins long ago</i>

00:55.371 --> 00:57.070
<i>in the old city of Prague.</i>

01:01.844 --> 01:03.846
<i>Throughout history our people</i>

01:04.412 --> 01:06.015
<i>have been demonized.</i>

01:06.882 --> 01:07.884
<i>Persecuted.</i>

01:09.150 --> 01:11.554
<i>Until one day, our holiest
rabbi,</i>

01:12.721 --> 01:13.722
<i>the Maharal,</i>

01:14.956 --> 01:17.859
<i>reaching deep into the darkest</i>
depths of the Kaballah,

01:18.861 --> 01:22.332
<i>gave the breath of</i>
life to a God-like creation.

01:49.057 --> 01:50.058
Shhh.

01:51.959 --> 01:52.961
Shhh.

01:54.129 --> 01:55.131
Calm down.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.534
Calm down.

02:02.671 --> 02:03.706
Shhhh.

02:07.042 --> 02:08.578
Open your mouth.

02:19.754 --> 02:20.757
Shhhh.

02:24.560 --> 02:25.561
Shhhh.

02:51.186 --> 02:54.056
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

03:07.635 --> 03:08.638
Child!

03:09.538 --> 03:11.474
Leave! Leave now!

03:21.883 --> 03:23.985
But when a man tries to play
God,

03:24.520 --> 03:26.522
the darkness awakens.

03:32.060 --> 03:33.062
And so it did.

04:23.946 --> 04:24.947
We're done.

04:33.822 --> 04:34.956
You can get up now.

04:45.132 --> 04:47.068
Thank you so much for your help.

04:48.603 --> 04:50.740
Your seven bad years are over,
Hanna.

04:52.107 --> 04:54.043
It's time for your seven good
ones.

05:06.721 --> 05:07.822
Thank you, Perla.

05:54.036 --> 05:57.372
<i>Our world
is built upon broken vessels,</i>

05:58.305 --> 06:00.375
<i>and man is the same.</i>

06:05.180 --> 06:07.182
<i>Out of darkness, cometh light.</i>

06:08.817 --> 06:11.252
Out of death, springeth life.

06:12.187 --> 06:15.658
Out of ruin, riseth redemption.

06:16.958 --> 06:19.962
Our bodies are perishable,
transient...

06:22.029 --> 06:24.199
But our spirit is eternal.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.036
And there is the paradox.

06:28.235 --> 06:30.303
Can anyone name the elements

06:30.305 --> 06:32.775
that combine the Star of David,

06:33.141 --> 06:37.045
and represent man, body, and
soul.

06:39.848 --> 06:41.417
We're all scholars here,

06:43.050 --> 06:45.920
Isn't there a saint among
sinners?

07:01.970 --> 07:04.273
All of these elements together

07:04.773 --> 07:06.742
represent the creation of man.

07:08.110 --> 07:10.713
And are mentioned in the holy
Kabbalah.

07:11.146 --> 07:12.814
- Merkabah.
- As "merkabah."

07:13.848 --> 07:16.718
Three dimensional Star of David.

07:20.221 --> 07:21.820
Alright, we will pick this up

07:21.822 --> 07:23.291
after we have something to eat.

07:29.264 --> 07:31.199
Do you have food, Benjamin?

07:33.502 --> 07:35.135
Hanna brought me a meal.

07:35.137 --> 07:36.172
Benjamin.

07:37.939 --> 07:39.875
It'll be seven years since...

07:40.975 --> 07:43.375
At this point, you have every
right

07:43.377 --> 07:44.479
to cast her away.

07:45.279 --> 07:46.281
And start fresh

07:47.348 --> 07:49.752
with a woman who will do her
duty.

07:51.086 --> 07:53.055
I'm not casting away my wife,
Father.

07:57.425 --> 07:59.161
As you wish.

09:22.977 --> 09:24.312
How's my little wolfling today?

09:29.484 --> 09:31.217
You know, you're very scary.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.529
How have you all been doing?

09:41.929 --> 09:42.931
Thank the Lord.

09:44.466 --> 09:45.567
Would you like to come in?

09:47.101 --> 09:48.267
The children would love the

09:48.269 --> 09:49.572
company of a man in the house.

09:50.004 --> 09:51.005
Thank you,

09:52.106 --> 09:54.909
but I think Hanna has probably
prepared something.

10:15.596 --> 10:16.966
Thank you for the book.

10:22.537 --> 10:24.139
It's the last time, Hanna.

10:25.706 --> 10:27.475
Kabbalah is far too dangerous.

10:29.311 --> 10:31.310
They say any man just reading
these

10:31.312 --> 10:33.282
texts could lose his mind, or
worse.

10:34.115 --> 10:35.116
Let alone...

10:37.152 --> 10:38.153
A woman?

10:44.058 --> 10:44.891
I'm sorry.

10:44.893 --> 10:46.595
I just don't want you to get
hurt.

10:48.562 --> 10:49.664
You've been through enough.

12:00.134 --> 12:01.135
May this act

12:02.803 --> 12:04.339
grant us in our time a child.

12:06.673 --> 12:07.675
Baby boy.

12:08.342 --> 12:10.144
Amen. Amen.

12:33.835 --> 12:35.104
Where you going?

12:36.136 --> 12:37.302
To study.

12:37.304 --> 12:38.306
Hanna.

12:41.142 --> 12:42.745
God's here, he's around you.

12:44.711 --> 12:46.481
In people, in life itself.

13:24.418 --> 13:26.151
The combination of the sacred

13:26.153 --> 13:27.822
letters hide in the holy Torah.

13:28.789 --> 13:30.422
The holy verses Moses

13:30.424 --> 13:32.360
used to part the Red Sea.

13:35.697 --> 13:36.697
Merkabah.

13:37.565 --> 13:38.700
Creation of man.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.115
Be careful of the rocks!

13:54.782 --> 13:56.185
Sister, be careful!

14:06.260 --> 14:07.261
Come on!

14:24.846 --> 14:27.515
You are now purified.

14:37.325 --> 14:39.291
I wish Momma and Poppa were
still

14:39.293 --> 14:41.129
here to see you getting married.

14:42.496 --> 14:44.399
They'll be watching from up
above.

14:45.365 --> 14:47.735
Along with your little Joseph,

14:48.802 --> 14:49.969
God rest his soul.

14:55.509 --> 14:56.511
I'm sorry.

14:59.279 --> 15:00.749
We should head back now.

15:04.418 --> 15:05.419
Let's go.

15:07.855 --> 15:10.259
We're too close to
where the gentiles live.

15:28.976 --> 15:31.913
That's the plague, starting
to spread again.

15:43.323 --> 15:44.425
Whoa.

16:23.798 --> 16:25.466
Rebecca and Jacob.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.569
Be fruitful and multiply.

16:29.437 --> 16:31.340
Replenish the earth like seeds.

16:31.806 --> 16:33.242
With many children.

16:33.774 --> 16:34.775
Amen!

16:36.744 --> 16:40.349
Now the bride will circle
the groom seven times.

16:41.481 --> 16:45.553
The number seven symbolizes
the perfection of creation.

16:46.854 --> 16:50.025
And so the couple shall become
one.

16:50.490 --> 16:53.495
Under the HUPA and united.

18:07.501 --> 18:08.836
One by one,

18:09.836 --> 18:12.039
my people are dropping like
flies,

18:14.442 --> 18:17.509
while your kind is out
celebrating.

18:17.511 --> 18:18.512
Please,

18:19.413 --> 18:20.779
this is my wedding!

18:20.781 --> 18:22.850
And you're putting us all at
risk!

18:23.651 --> 18:24.653
Rebecca!

18:28.623 --> 18:30.692
What is the meaning of this?

18:34.494 --> 18:35.496
Hold my hand.

18:41.469 --> 18:43.572
This girl is my eldest.

18:47.642 --> 18:48.643
And you,

18:49.743 --> 18:51.612
you cannot fight us like men,

18:52.613 --> 18:55.150
so you kill us like rats.

18:56.217 --> 18:59.788
Cursing us with your dirty
spells.

19:02.056 --> 19:05.126
We have no part in your
precious child taking ill.

19:08.796 --> 19:10.962
This plague didn't reach us
because

19:10.964 --> 19:12.900
we are isolated in this village.

19:15.036 --> 19:18.807
God giveth, and God taketh.

19:27.147 --> 19:27.948
Hanna, don't.

19:29.717 --> 19:31.153
Oh no, oh not this! No!

19:33.988 --> 19:35.990
Unless you reverse your spells,

19:36.190 --> 19:37.692
and save my daughter,

19:38.692 --> 19:39.693
I will show you

19:41.596 --> 19:42.596
and your God,

19:43.163 --> 19:44.465
who is in charge.

19:46.133 --> 19:47.134
Give her to me.

19:50.003 --> 19:51.005
I am a healer.

19:52.673 --> 19:54.910
If you bring her to my house,

19:55.509 --> 19:56.577
I will help her.

19:57.144 --> 19:58.145
Papa!

20:05.685 --> 20:08.756
Until my daughter
is cured, no one leaves!

20:10.290 --> 20:13.461
Anyone we catch outside the
village

20:14.828 --> 20:15.931
will be executed.

20:23.938 --> 20:24.940
Are you okay?

20:57.238 --> 21:00.041
This is a sign. We must repent.

21:01.675 --> 21:02.777
Embrace his will.

21:03.911 --> 21:05.614
May his name be praised.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.048
And pray...

21:09.616 --> 21:11.853
Pray with all we have.

21:12.886 --> 21:13.888
With reverence.

21:15.655 --> 21:20.028
To that end, I am hereby
declaring three days of mourning.

21:26.232 --> 21:27.769
We should fight back.

21:35.977 --> 21:37.879
I mean no disrespect, Rabbi.

21:38.746 --> 21:41.316
But besides prayer there are
other things which can be done.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.616
We must use our strongest force.

21:44.618 --> 21:48.589
You suggest hitting them over
the head with our prayer books?

21:49.089 --> 21:51.158
With the wisdom of the holy
Kabbalah.

21:52.058 --> 21:55.262
A woman, speaking of Kabbalah
wisdom.

21:55.930 --> 21:57.729
Wonders truly never cease.

21:57.731 --> 21:59.998
We could use the 72 sacred
letters of God,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.634
along with the hidden code
inside the book of creation

22:02.636 --> 22:04.068
and create ourselves a go...

22:04.070 --> 22:05.072
Golem?

22:06.307 --> 22:08.943
You clearly
have no idea of what you speak!

22:09.676 --> 22:12.210
How do you even know about that
book,

22:12.212 --> 22:14.214
and the sacred letters of God?

22:16.884 --> 22:18.950
I wouldn't attempt
to control the

22:18.952 --> 22:20.986
tremendous force
of the Kabbalah.

22:20.988 --> 22:22.657
It has been done before.

22:23.891 --> 22:26.928
Who do you suggest
might create this creature?

22:27.394 --> 22:29.263
Moses himself, perhaps.

22:30.931 --> 22:31.932
I will.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.836
You propose to create a Golem,

22:37.104 --> 22:40.075
when you can't even give my son
a child?

22:53.086 --> 22:55.356
We have to stand up for ourselves!
Go home, Hanna!

22:58.025 --> 22:59.027
Just go home.

23:22.083 --> 23:23.184
Remember.

23:24.785 --> 23:25.787
Fail...

23:26.753 --> 23:29.089
and I will burn this place to
the ground.

23:31.892 --> 23:32.894
Keep going.

23:49.876 --> 23:51.445
Lord, oh Lord.

23:52.846 --> 23:54.281
Merciful, ruthful Lord.

23:55.449 --> 23:56.685
We beseech thee,

23:58.885 --> 24:00.989
save this ailing child.

24:02.923 --> 24:05.259
Send a heavenly cure.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.863
"And all the people of the
Earth"

24:09.497 --> 24:12.701
shall see that thou art called

24:13.134 --> 24:14.868
"by the name of the Lord."

24:15.336 --> 24:17.135
- Amen...
- Amen!

24:17.137 --> 24:18.939
- Amen...
- Amen!

24:19.240 --> 24:20.974
- Amen...
- Amen!

24:21.474 --> 24:22.876
- Amen...
- Amen!

24:23.544 --> 24:24.813
- Amen...
- Amen!

24:41.261 --> 24:42.262
Go home, Jew!

25:07.453 --> 25:08.455
Rebecca.

25:18.199 --> 25:20.034
What have they done to you?

25:21.868 --> 25:22.870
I was pregnant.

25:24.238 --> 25:25.774
But I lost it, Hanna.

25:26.941 --> 25:28.343
I lost my baby.

25:40.487 --> 25:42.854
You will sneak her out of the
village.

25:42.856 --> 25:44.057
She needs a doctor.

25:52.866 --> 25:54.232
I lost it, Hanna.

26:22.896 --> 26:27.032
The 72 sacred letters of God
are hidden in the Torah.

26:27.034 --> 26:28.937
In order to reveal the code,

26:29.202 --> 26:32.307
one must use the power
of the holy merkabah.

26:34.040 --> 26:38.546
The holy merkabah combines all of
the kabbalistic elements together

26:39.512 --> 26:41.882
representing the creation of
man.

27:06.339 --> 27:09.176
The 72 sacred letters come
together

27:11.577 --> 27:13.882
to create the hidden name of
God.

27:18.986 --> 27:20.622
In order to create a Golem,

27:21.255 --> 27:24.359
one must use virgin, unploughed
soil,

27:25.058 --> 27:26.994
from a mountain or forest.

27:48.315 --> 27:50.585
The hidden name of God.

27:56.123 --> 27:57.525
Let there be life.

29:01.055 --> 29:03.191
<i>Joseph! No!</i>

29:04.458 --> 29:06.361
<i>Please! Joseph!</i>

29:07.060 --> 29:09.563
<i>Joseph! No!</i>

30:36.817 --> 30:37.818
Shhhh.

30:40.554 --> 30:41.556
Shhhh.

30:43.589 --> 30:45.158
Please be well, child.

31:28.335 --> 31:29.636
She made this for me.

31:32.605 --> 31:33.607
Svetlana.

31:35.842 --> 31:36.844
My little one.

31:38.511 --> 31:40.213
She's a strong girl.

31:40.948 --> 31:43.551
With God's help, she'll be well
again.

31:44.417 --> 31:46.686
I'm doing everything I can.

31:49.323 --> 31:50.324
Please.

31:50.923 --> 31:52.727
Have mercy on our village.

32:12.645 --> 32:14.414
Nobody stays outside!

32:14.981 --> 32:16.917
Stay in your home!

32:32.798 --> 32:34.634
Hanna, where are you going?

32:47.314 --> 32:48.316
Hanna.

34:20.806 --> 34:21.808
Benjamin?

34:23.043 --> 34:24.909
You haven't been up in the attic, have you?
The trunk...

34:24.911 --> 34:25.913
What is this?

34:40.159 --> 34:41.960
How long have you been...?

34:48.001 --> 34:49.103
Benjamin, please.

34:51.070 --> 34:52.436
My God.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.773
I'm so sorry.

35:02.148 --> 35:06.886
I couldn't bear the thought
of losing another child.

35:11.425 --> 35:13.027
Benjamin, you can't leave.

35:14.894 --> 35:16.594
Benjamin, look at... stop...

35:16.596 --> 35:17.662
We need to talk...

35:17.664 --> 35:19.400
It's been seven years.

35:21.568 --> 35:24.705
Seven years since our boy died.

35:25.605 --> 35:26.639
This whole time,

35:27.673 --> 35:29.143
you've been lying to me?

35:31.777 --> 35:33.513
For seven years?

35:35.681 --> 35:37.951
Preventing us from having
children,

35:38.652 --> 35:40.588
from becoming a family again?

35:42.054 --> 35:42.855
Benjamin...

35:43.722 --> 35:46.025
You've never been to Joseph's
grave.

35:48.594 --> 35:51.664
Never left so much as a
rock on his headstone.

35:52.998 --> 35:54.465
Never shed a tear.

35:54.467 --> 35:55.702
Benjamin, please.

35:55.936 --> 35:59.507
You don't think losing him broke
me, too?

36:01.507 --> 36:02.576
I'm done, Hanna.

36:04.844 --> 36:08.014
I can't stand the sight of you always
with your head in a bloody book.

36:08.547 --> 36:10.650
Escaping life, escaping reality.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.818
However much you study, however
many Kabbalah books you read,

36:14.820 --> 36:18.425
you will never get an answer
to why God took our son.

36:23.195 --> 36:24.864
Because there isn't one.

36:38.777 --> 36:39.846
You are a woman.

36:41.581 --> 36:42.615
A giver of life.

36:43.983 --> 36:47.721
God has assigned you a calling
and you are refusing it.

36:49.255 --> 36:50.857
You should be ashamed.

37:55.355 --> 37:56.557
Shhh.

40:22.367 --> 40:23.369
Stop, you!

40:35.047 --> 40:36.414
You have been told

40:36.416 --> 40:38.018
not to leave the village.

42:40.206 --> 42:41.842
I'll come back soon.

43:06.565 --> 43:07.567
Benjamin.

43:38.297 --> 43:39.298
What's wrong?

43:43.268 --> 43:44.904
Where did you get that?

43:47.606 --> 43:49.309
It's time to fight back.

43:50.309 --> 43:51.378
Are you with me?

43:52.445 --> 43:55.182
You fire one shot
and all hell will break loose.

43:56.114 --> 43:58.351
They won't leave a
single one of us standing.

44:00.052 --> 44:01.153
She was pregnant.

44:03.588 --> 44:05.125
Rebecca was pregnant.

44:25.077 --> 44:28.014
A golem is to be only used for
protection.

44:28.481 --> 44:30.384
For the greater good of all.

44:35.989 --> 44:37.391
A golem can evolve.

45:30.476 --> 45:31.478
Here.

45:32.478 --> 45:34.213
This used to be my son's.

45:34.480 --> 45:35.481
Joseph.

45:36.114 --> 45:38.017
He would have been your age.

45:44.322 --> 45:46.592
It used to comfort
him when he was upset.

45:48.661 --> 45:51.298
Don't be afraid. It's only
thunder.

45:59.739 --> 46:02.009
I'll be right inside the house.

46:55.293 --> 46:56.295
Hanna?

46:59.565 --> 47:01.134
What is this boy?

47:04.237 --> 47:05.238
I have done it.

47:06.371 --> 47:08.375
I've created a golem.

47:13.746 --> 47:15.715
Child, what have you done?

47:16.481 --> 47:18.349
This boy saved me.

47:18.351 --> 47:20.818
He took on a handful of
men with his bare hands...

47:20.820 --> 47:22.556
It is a heartless monster,

47:23.989 --> 47:25.722
and we must take it back from whence
it came before it is too late.

47:25.724 --> 47:27.193
He is our protector.

47:27.659 --> 47:28.661
Our savior.

47:30.730 --> 47:34.101
You have created a pact
with the sitra-achra.

47:34.500 --> 47:35.635
We have no choice.

47:36.936 --> 47:39.506
You will never be able to heal
that girl.

47:39.739 --> 47:42.472
It is only a matter of time
before Vladmir and his men

47:42.474 --> 47:45.612
kill us all and burn our
village to the ground.

48:12.838 --> 48:16.810
You and I, we have crossed paths
before.

48:18.344 --> 48:20.480
I saw it all when I was a child.

48:23.382 --> 48:28.355
I saw you destroy our enemies,
but also the ones we loved.

48:43.702 --> 48:45.771
Promise me,

48:45.972 --> 48:48.240
as soon as Vladimir is gone,

48:48.807 --> 48:51.610
you take that parchment out of
its mouth,

48:51.811 --> 48:54.280
and put an end to this golem
child.

48:57.717 --> 48:58.518
I promise.

49:02.387 --> 49:04.824
It will never die like the rest
of us.

50:32.411 --> 50:35.382
This is the last time you leave

50:35.748 --> 50:38.518
without my daughter standing on
her feet.

51:21.594 --> 51:24.396
We need to get
you some real clothes.

55:10.655 --> 55:12.659
It's going to be cold tonight.

55:13.659 --> 55:15.961
You can sleep here, inside the
house.

55:34.413 --> 55:35.615
Mmm.

55:37.282 --> 55:38.284
It's delicious.

55:39.985 --> 55:42.255
Just the way
God intended it to be.

55:44.789 --> 55:48.094
Ahh, are you sure that's
all I can get you?

55:48.360 --> 55:50.028
Yes. Thank you.

55:51.163 --> 55:53.032
I should get back to prayer.

55:58.804 --> 56:00.006
I'm sorry, I can't.

56:03.976 --> 56:05.711
She still has your heart.

56:16.054 --> 56:17.056
Thank you.

56:21.960 --> 56:22.961
Good night.

57:46.177 --> 57:47.179
<i>Joseph!</i>

57:47.913 --> 57:48.914
<i>No!</i>

57:49.213 --> 57:50.215
<i>Please!</i>

57:51.150 --> 57:52.282
<i>Joseph!</i>

57:52.284 --> 57:53.286
<i>Joseph!</i>

57:53.885 --> 57:54.887
<i>No!</i>

58:11.269 --> 58:12.739
You're safe.

58:13.838 --> 58:14.840
It's okay.

58:28.487 --> 58:29.489
Abigail?

58:48.507 --> 58:49.775
They're animals.

58:50.976 --> 58:52.311
They're wild animals!

59:20.539 --> 59:21.541
Jacob!

59:24.242 --> 59:25.244
Jacob!

59:33.150 --> 59:34.152
It's time.

59:39.056 --> 59:40.222
Benjamin!

59:45.130 --> 59:46.865
This is not our way, son.

59:47.632 --> 59:48.835
It is now.

59:50.469 --> 59:52.038
I'm warning you.

59:52.536 --> 59:53.572
Benjamin!

01:00:36.315 --> 01:00:37.316
No.

01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:41.547
What do you want?

01:01:42.914 --> 01:01:44.951
You're murderers! We
want you out of our village, now.

01:01:45.384 --> 01:01:47.086
No one's going anywhere.

01:02:36.268 --> 01:02:38.704
Where's your gun now, Jew?

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:48.273
Papa?

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:54.613
Stop!

01:03:57.681 --> 01:03:59.117
Take your daughter,

01:03:59.451 --> 01:04:00.786
and get off our land.

01:04:03.922 --> 01:04:05.124
Now!

01:06:12.317 --> 01:06:13.318
Shhh.

01:06:31.436 --> 01:06:32.504
We buried Jacob.

01:06:41.579 --> 01:06:42.581
Stay still.

01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:48.019
You were right.

01:06:49.954 --> 01:06:52.825
We should've stood up for
ourselves from the beginning.

01:06:59.597 --> 01:07:00.599
I'm sorry.

01:07:03.434 --> 01:07:04.469
You're here now,

01:07:05.436 --> 01:07:06.904
that's all that matters.

01:07:22.753 --> 01:07:24.052
He won't hurt us, right?

01:07:24.054 --> 01:07:25.056
Of course not.

01:07:25.956 --> 01:07:27.625
He's here to protect us.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:50.782
Join us.

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:40.899
What's wrong?

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.143
I'm fine.

01:08:58.783 --> 01:08:59.785
He loves music.

01:09:03.822 --> 01:09:05.524
You should play for him.

01:09:39.923 --> 01:09:42.694
This music tells the story of
our people.

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:44.595
Our happiness.

01:09:44.828 --> 01:09:45.831
Our sadness.

01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:48.899
Our most sacred moments.

01:09:51.202 --> 01:09:52.171
Our lives.

01:09:54.605 --> 01:09:55.606
Our deaths.

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:23.168
Sweet dreams.

01:10:56.067 --> 01:10:57.567
Thank you for the dinner.

01:10:57.569 --> 01:10:58.570
My pleasure.

01:11:07.244 --> 01:11:08.779
You don't have to go.

01:12:16.314 --> 01:12:18.848
In the name of the Lord I
command thee,

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:20.285
return to the Earth.

01:12:22.086 --> 01:12:23.655
Ashes to ashes,

01:12:24.354 --> 01:12:25.723
dust to dust.

01:12:27.024 --> 01:12:28.726
In the name of the Lord,

01:12:29.327 --> 01:12:30.329
I command thee,

01:12:31.061 --> 01:12:32.331
return to the Earth.

01:14:45.395 --> 01:14:46.398
Hanna!

01:14:55.038 --> 01:14:56.041
What is it?

01:14:57.942 --> 01:14:59.778
We have to get out of here.

01:15:00.511 --> 01:15:01.943
What are you talking about?

01:15:01.945 --> 01:15:03.014
It killed Perla.

01:15:04.481 --> 01:15:05.951
Probably Sarah, too.

01:15:07.185 --> 01:15:08.854
It is no savior.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.889
It is a monster.

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.993
A demon.

01:15:15.225 --> 01:15:17.228
He's just a little boy.

01:15:19.063 --> 01:15:20.766
There's no evil in him.

01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:22.267
No.

01:15:23.967 --> 01:15:25.503
Hanna, it must be killed.

01:15:27.505 --> 01:15:29.440
Nobody's killing anyone here.

01:15:33.109 --> 01:15:34.512
Benjamin, come to bed.

01:15:46.323 --> 01:15:47.324
Father.

01:15:48.259 --> 01:15:50.159
Father, we have to save Hanna.

01:15:50.161 --> 01:15:52.361
The golem...

01:15:52.363 --> 01:15:53.798
He kills innocents.

01:15:55.466 --> 01:15:56.535
He killed Perla.

01:15:58.135 --> 01:15:59.938
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:16:02.472 --> 01:16:04.009
Gather ten loyal men,

01:16:04.574 --> 01:16:06.010
form a minyan.

01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:09.980
We'll destroy him,

01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:11.882
with the Pulsa Denoura.

01:20:30.207 --> 01:20:31.209
No!

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:41.419
No!

01:20:42.886 --> 01:20:44.253
No!

01:20:46.356 --> 01:20:47.358
No!

01:20:54.532 --> 01:20:56.534
Let me in! Let me in!

01:20:57.234 --> 01:20:58.236
Let me in!

01:21:07.243 --> 01:21:08.246
Let me in!

01:21:08.511 --> 01:21:09.514
Let me in!

01:21:10.547 --> 01:21:11.715
Don't kill my boy!

01:21:12.248 --> 01:21:13.251
Don't kill him!

01:22:33.764 --> 01:22:35.699
Joseph.

01:22:49.445 --> 01:22:50.747
Benjamin, don't stop!

01:27:29.259 --> 01:27:30.261
Hanna.

01:27:32.962 --> 01:27:34.197
That's not our son.

01:27:35.765 --> 01:27:37.234
Our son is dead, Hanna.

01:27:38.068 --> 01:27:39.070
Please.

01:27:47.911 --> 01:27:48.913
Hanna, please!

01:28:05.996 --> 01:28:08.231
My... my beautiful Joseph.

01:28:14.337 --> 01:28:17.240
My... my beautiful Joseph.

01:28:20.844 --> 01:28:23.146
You will always
be my little boy,

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.750
and I will always love you.

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:31.022
Hanna.

01:28:38.161 --> 01:28:40.131
I'm gonna have to let you go
now.

01:28:49.672 --> 01:28:52.076
Rest in peace, my baby.
