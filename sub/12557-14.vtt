00:09.759 --> 00:12.262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:12.297 --> 00:16.015
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:16.050 --> 00:17.267
a journey into a wondrous land

00:17.302 --> 00:19.769
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:19.804 --> 00:22.272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

02:30.266 --> 02:32.652
Mr. Mulligan, a rather
dour critic of his times,

02:32.687 --> 02:35.772
is shortly to discover
the import of that old phrase,

02:35.807 --> 02:38.274
"out of the frying pan,
into the fire"-

02:38.309 --> 02:40.777
said fire burning brightly
at all times

02:40.812 --> 02:43.279
in the twilight zone.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.629
You better move,
mister.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.881
Get out of the street.

07:14.418 --> 07:16.886
You want
to get yourself killed?!

07:17.520 --> 07:18.888
Hey, get out of there.

07:41.946 --> 07:44.046
Harmony?

07:49.552 --> 07:50.803
Hey!

08:05.184 --> 08:06.435
Hey!

08:09.572 --> 08:11.574
Hey! That's mine!

08:30.960 --> 08:35.097
There's nothing going on
around here, sergeant.

08:35.131 --> 08:37.216
Everything's as quiet as a...
mouse!

08:37.251 --> 08:37.850
Hey, you!

08:46.976 --> 08:49.862
Call you back, sergeant.

08:49.897 --> 08:50.479
Hey!

09:09.131 --> 09:11.000
Stop in the name of the law!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.162
Oh!

09:43.916 --> 09:45.785
You juvenile delinquent, you!

09:59.467 --> 10:01.300
Oh, no!

10:06.939 --> 10:08.808
It's broken.

10:08.843 --> 10:11.944
How am i going
to get back now?

10:16.065 --> 10:18.567
I only got 15 minutes.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.706
Let me try to
understand this, sir.

10:23.741 --> 10:26.208
You have this
funny-looking hat, no pants,

10:26.243 --> 10:28.711
and you've got to get
back to somewhere

10:28.746 --> 10:29.328
within 15 minutes?

10:29.962 --> 10:30.579
Right.

10:30.614 --> 10:32.465
This is a time helmet.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.716
I'm from 1890.

10:33.751 --> 10:36.218
That's where i've
got to get back to.

10:36.253 --> 10:38.087
And your trousers?

10:38.122 --> 10:40.589
I hung them up
to dry in 1890.

10:40.624 --> 10:41.841
You're from 1890?

10:41.876 --> 10:43.092
What proof have you?

10:43.127 --> 10:44.343
Proof?

10:44.378 --> 10:47.480
Yes. Ah! That watch.

10:47.515 --> 10:48.731
Those clothes.

10:48.766 --> 10:49.982
Where did
you get them?

10:50.599 --> 10:51.851
They're mine.

10:51.886 --> 10:53.736
Is it possible?!

10:54.987 --> 10:57.490
Quickly- who
is the president?

10:57.525 --> 10:58.741
You mean
benjamin harrison?

10:58.776 --> 10:59.992
Benjamin harrison.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.243
And before him?

11:01.278 --> 11:02.495
Grover cleveland.

11:02.530 --> 11:03.746
But what's that...?

11:03.781 --> 11:04.997
By george!

11:05.032 --> 11:06.866
I believe you, sir!

11:06.901 --> 11:08.751
You are from 1890!

11:08.786 --> 11:10.619
Well, that's
no news to me.

11:10.654 --> 11:13.122
How to get back
would be news.

11:13.157 --> 11:15.007
And this is
the device, eh?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.876
How does it work?

11:16.911 --> 11:18.127
Well, you...

11:18.162 --> 11:20.012
well, i don't know!

11:20.047 --> 11:21.881
See, i'm only
the janitor.

11:21.916 --> 11:23.132
Janitor, hmm?

11:23.167 --> 11:25.634
Hmm. Primitive,
but functional.

11:25.669 --> 11:26.886
Yes, yes, yes.

11:26.921 --> 11:28.771
Fascinating.

11:28.806 --> 11:31.273
Oh! Where are
you going?

11:35.778 --> 11:37.029
Proprietor!

11:37.279 --> 11:38.531
Propri...

11:38.566 --> 11:39.782
yeah?

11:44.653 --> 11:47.156
Would you come here
a moment, please?

11:48.826 --> 11:50.042
Yes, please.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.293
What is it?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.162
Can you fix it?

11:53.197 --> 11:55.047
We can fix anything.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.298
Good.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.418
Thursday,
about 2:00.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.927
Thursday?!
Thursday?!

12:18.821 --> 12:20.072
You don't understand.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.192
This man must
get back to 1890.

12:23.227 --> 12:25.077
Oh, you're in
the wrong block.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.946
This is
only 1600.

12:26.981 --> 12:28.197
No, no, no, no, no.

12:28.232 --> 12:30.082
That's a time helmet.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.585
And this man
is from the year 1890.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.704
What are you,
some kind of nut?

12:35.739 --> 12:36.956
I'm an electronic
scientist.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.458
Now, just lend me
those tools...

12:39.493 --> 12:40.709
don't touch!

12:41.210 --> 12:42.461
But this is...

12:42.496 --> 12:44.346
don't touch...

12:44.381 --> 12:46.849
don't touch
the tools!

12:54.974 --> 12:56.859
Listen to me.

12:56.894 --> 12:58.110
Howdy.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.613
I'm going to tell you something.

13:00.648 --> 13:01.864
Yeah.

13:01.899 --> 13:05.618
That man doesn't
have all his buttons.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.125
Oh, you don't believe me, huh?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.994
Well, i'll prove it to you.

13:15.029 --> 13:16.879
Look at these papers.

13:16.914 --> 13:18.130
We barely have
15 minutes

13:18.165 --> 13:20.499
to get back to his
time continuum.

13:20.534 --> 13:21.750
If you'll repair...

13:21.785 --> 13:23.002
excuse me.

13:24.253 --> 13:25.504
This feller says

13:25.539 --> 13:28.007
he hasn't got
all his buttons.

13:28.042 --> 13:30.509
What's he mean,
he has no buttons?

13:30.544 --> 13:33.646
Means he has no mental
facilities, yes?

13:33.681 --> 13:34.897
Who said that?

13:34.932 --> 13:37.399
This feller here
in the window.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.268
That's tv!

13:39.303 --> 13:40.519
Who's tv?

13:40.554 --> 13:42.404
Tv- television.

13:42.439 --> 13:44.907
Oh, you wouldn't
understand if i told...

13:44.942 --> 13:48.027
what on earth are you
doing, young man?

13:48.062 --> 13:49.912
Don't do that
to me, pal.

13:49.947 --> 13:51.163
Look, look, look.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.414
All we want

13:52.449 --> 13:54.283
is this soldered
to that.

13:54.318 --> 13:56.168
Don't touch the
tools, will you?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.419
You don't
understand.

13:57.454 --> 14:01.173
D-d-don't touch my tools,
if you don't mind.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.293
Look, allow me to
show this to you.

14:04.328 --> 14:05.544
Don't touch
the tools!

14:11.050 --> 14:12.301
What did you say?

14:12.336 --> 14:14.803
I'm trying
to explain to you...

14:14.838 --> 14:16.689
don't holler.
Don't holler!

14:16.724 --> 14:17.940
You don't...

14:17.975 --> 14:19.191
just a moment, please.

14:21.729 --> 14:22.945
Now...

14:22.980 --> 14:24.196
help!

14:24.813 --> 14:26.699
Help!

14:27.316 --> 14:29.201
H-h-help!

14:31.070 --> 14:32.321
H-h-he...

14:32.356 --> 14:34.823
what are you
doing in here?!

14:34.858 --> 14:38.577
Now, look, we want to get
this thing finished in time.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.462
Just sit down
quietly, please.

14:40.497 --> 14:41.714
Now.

14:41.749 --> 14:43.582
You sure this isn't

14:43.617 --> 14:45.467
some kind of
a coffee maker?

14:45.502 --> 14:47.336
No, sir, that's a
very scientific

14:47.371 --> 14:49.221
piece of equipment.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.114
Five dollars, please.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.765
What is that little
thing in there?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.016
Oh, well,
that, you see...

15:34.051 --> 15:35.267
that is a transitron.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.136
Don't... don't
touch my tools,

15:37.171 --> 15:38.387
if you don't mind.

15:38.422 --> 15:40.889
I'm merely trying
to point out to you that,

15:40.924 --> 15:42.775
in order to
facilitate that...

15:42.810 --> 15:44.643
don't point with
my tools, please.

15:44.678 --> 15:47.780
Would you allow me
to please make this
clear to you?

15:47.815 --> 15:49.031
Don't you understa...?

15:49.066 --> 15:50.899
That's mine!

15:50.934 --> 15:53.402
Oh, just a moment!

16:01.543 --> 16:04.046
Now where has he gone?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.668
Come on out.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.422
Will you come out?!

16:15.924 --> 16:17.810
Just keep working.

16:17.845 --> 16:19.061
Keep working!

16:31.358 --> 16:33.075
Hey...

16:33.110 --> 16:34.576
what's the idea

16:34.611 --> 16:36.445
of running around
the street

16:36.480 --> 16:38.330
with no pants on?

17:06.474 --> 17:08.977
Alley... oop!

17:40.759 --> 17:42.010
Well, is it ready?

17:42.045 --> 17:43.896
Couple of small,
minor adjustments,

17:43.931 --> 17:45.764
you'll
be all set.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.649
I envy you
your trip, sir.

17:47.684 --> 17:51.653
1890 is a
wonderful period.

17:51.688 --> 17:54.156
Mmm. For instance,
no income tax.

17:54.191 --> 17:56.024
Income tax?

17:56.059 --> 17:58.527
I am a scholar
of that period, sir.

17:58.562 --> 18:02.281
It has a charm- nay,
a fascination- for me.

18:02.316 --> 18:03.532
The very thought

18:03.567 --> 18:07.286
of having lived
in those halcyon days...

18:07.321 --> 18:09.171
i'll sure be glad
to get back.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.039
If i ever do.

18:11.074 --> 18:13.542
How much time
is there left?

18:13.577 --> 18:14.793
Oh...

18:14.828 --> 18:16.678
we got less than
five minutes!

18:16.713 --> 18:19.798
Mmm. Tell me
about your town, sir.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.935
Where, for instance,
might a scientist
find employment?

18:22.970 --> 18:24.186
You a scientist?

18:24.221 --> 18:26.688
Yes. Are there any
in your town?

18:26.723 --> 18:27.940
Well, professor gilbert.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.808
I work for him.

18:29.843 --> 18:31.059
There you are, gentlemen.

18:31.094 --> 18:32.945
All fixed.

18:32.980 --> 18:35.197
Good. What
do we do now?

18:35.232 --> 18:36.315
Uh... pay me.

18:36.350 --> 18:37.566
Hmm?

18:37.601 --> 18:40.068
Pay the man,
pay the man.

18:42.821 --> 18:45.324
Ah! That's just
the right amount.

18:45.359 --> 18:46.575
Thank you.

18:46.610 --> 18:48.460
Uh... how does
it work?

18:48.495 --> 18:50.963
Oh, you just
set this dial.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.084
Good!

18:58.005 --> 19:00.472
Hey, what are
you doing?

19:00.507 --> 19:02.341
I intend to
use it myself

19:02.376 --> 19:03.592
in exactly
three minutes.

19:03.627 --> 19:04.843
You can't do that!

19:04.878 --> 19:06.094
But iam
doing it, sir.

19:06.129 --> 19:07.980
I'm returning to
that time of bliss

19:08.015 --> 19:08.597
and simple pleasures!

19:08.632 --> 19:09.848
And leaving me here?

19:09.883 --> 19:11.733
Your fate is
unimportant, sir.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.602
You are a janitor.

19:13.637 --> 19:14.853
I am a scientist!

19:14.888 --> 19:16.104
Why, i...

19:16.139 --> 19:17.356
stand back!

19:17.391 --> 19:19.241
In less than
three minutes,

19:19.276 --> 19:21.743
i shall have escaped
this age of madness!

19:24.746 --> 19:25.364
Look, look.

19:25.399 --> 19:27.249
I brought a chicken
with me

19:27.284 --> 19:29.117
all the way from 1890.

19:29.152 --> 19:30.369
All i did was hold it.

19:30.404 --> 19:32.254
We can go back together.

19:32.289 --> 19:33.505
You're lying, sir.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.756
I am not.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.310
Hey, look out!

20:31.430 --> 20:34.182
Get that nut
out of here.

20:34.217 --> 20:37.319
1890, here i come.

23:48.877 --> 23:50.762
"To each his own."

23:50.797 --> 23:52.631
So goes another old phrase

23:52.666 --> 23:56.384
to which mr. Woodrow mulligan
would heartily subscribe.

23:56.419 --> 23:58.887
For he has learned,
definitely the hard way,

23:58.922 --> 24:02.023
that there is much wisdom
in a third old phrase

24:02.058 --> 24:03.892
which goes as follows:

24:03.927 --> 24:05.777
"Stay in your own backyard."

24:05.812 --> 24:07.646
To which it might be added,

24:07.681 --> 24:10.782
"and, if possible, assist
others to stay in theirs."

24:10.817 --> 24:13.285
Via, of course,
the twilight zone.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.989
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:18.024 --> 24:19.875
will tell you
about next week's story

24:19.910 --> 24:22.377
after this message.

24:23.979 --> 24:25.664
And now, mr. Serling.

24:25.699 --> 24:27.549
Next week, onthe twilight zone,

24:27.584 --> 24:29.417
you'll find yourself
inexplicably entangled

24:29.452 --> 24:30.669
in this dark dungeon.

24:30.704 --> 24:33.171
You'll meet an incredible
group of people who, like you,

24:33.206 --> 24:35.674
will be quite unable to explain
how they got there,

24:35.709 --> 24:37.559
why they got there,
or how they're going to get out.

24:37.594 --> 24:39.427
And, at the end,
we're going to belt you

24:39.462 --> 24:41.930
with one of the most surprising
endings we've ever had.

24:41.965 --> 24:43.815
