00:09.009 --> 00:13.048
Having been spat upon by Dabra,
King of the Demon Realm of Darkness,

00:13.263 --> 00:17.973
Kuririn and Piccolo have turned to stone.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.096
In order to return the two to normal,

00:20.312 --> 00:25.102
Goku and the others
went inside the spaceship.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.684
Babidi-sama is on the very bottom floor.

00:28.904 --> 00:32.067
However, you must pass
through a number of these stages

00:32.281 --> 00:33.818
and defeat the warriors that appear in them,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.820
or you cannot proceed downward.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.823
Will they be able to defeat the enemy warriors

00:39.039 --> 00:43.624
and arrive at the command room
where Babidi is?

00:43.836 --> 00:46.669
The first stage has begun!

02:13.967 --> 02:19.928
"Don't Sell Super Saiyans Short!
Vegeta and Goku's Full-Bore Power!"

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
Die!

02:33.070 --> 02:37.689
Hmph, you're better than I thought.
But that's where it ends!

02:58.679 --> 03:00.886
See? That's what I've been telling you.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.885
Vegeta can more than handle this on his own.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.697
Over here, idiot.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.910
l-lncredible...

03:30.127 --> 03:33.619
That's our Vegeta-san.
He's far more intense than before.

03:33.839 --> 03:37.582
Vegeta has been keeping up
his training, all right.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.759
What is Puipui doing?!

03:40.971 --> 03:43.007
If he doesn't inflict any
damage upon that man,

03:43.223 --> 03:47.307
we can't collect any energy
to revive Majin Boo, you know!

03:47.519 --> 03:50.682
Oh, he is just getting started.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.311
It looks as though Puipui
was being a bit inattentive.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.317
What's wrong? Is that all you've got?

03:57.529 --> 04:00.316
What?! Damn it!

04:11.877 --> 04:14.869
Hey, where does Puipui feel at home again?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.339
The high-gravity Planet Zun.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.632
Hmm, Planet Zun, huh? All right...!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.304
Papparapa!!

04:31.480 --> 04:32.765
Huh?

04:32.981 --> 04:36.565
W-What? What just happened?
Where is this place?

04:36.777 --> 04:41.567
This is Babidi's doing.
He changed the room with his magic.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.694
Probably to a place more
advantageous to that warrior.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.526
Oh, yeah? That should be interesting, huh?

04:47.746 --> 04:50.533
But Goku-san, this places Vegeta-san...

04:50.749 --> 04:52.660
Well, just keep watching.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.374
You fool! You've had it now!

05:07.140 --> 05:11.804
This is Planet Zun. I grew up on this planet.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.021
The gravity here is ten times
what it is on Earth.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.440
I doubt you people can withstand that!

05:23.281 --> 05:30.574
So what if it is? At ten times the gravity,
I don't feel a thing.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.786
Y-You're lying! I know you're bluffing!

05:35.002 --> 05:37.709
Let me show you whether or not it's a bluff.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.209
Impossible! Die!

06:02.571 --> 06:04.937
I told you I wasn't bluffing.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.365
Damn it!

06:27.804 --> 06:29.010
You did it!

06:29.222 --> 06:33.431
Hmph, that punk Babidi.
Send me a worthless opponent, will he?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.476
Oh, look! The hole leading
downward opened up!

06:36.688 --> 06:39.270
It's like one of those elevator things.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.474
Th-This is like a TV game show, isn't it?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.854
Hmph, a really boring game!

06:46.239 --> 06:49.322
Hey! Let's go, Kaioshin-sama!

06:50.327 --> 06:54.115
l-lt can't be... How can they be this strong?

07:01.171 --> 07:03.082
Hey...

07:03.298 --> 07:05.835
This room is the same as the last one, ain't it?

07:06.051 --> 07:08.212
Ah, but they could change
the location with magic,

07:08.428 --> 07:11.795
like they did just before, couldn't they?

07:12.015 --> 07:15.599
W-What is someone with that
much power doing on Earth?!

07:15.811 --> 07:19.395
S-Sir, there were not any beings
like this 300 years ago,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.972
when you had us investigate.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.478
D-Damn...

07:24.694 --> 07:28.312
Still, even at that level,
there is no need for concern.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.365
There are still three more stages remaining,

07:31.576 --> 07:36.741
and if it comes down to it,
you have me here, do you not?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.540
This time, it's my turn to fight!

07:44.756 --> 07:47.839
Okay, I wonder what kinda guy I'm gonna get.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.667
I sure hope it's someone ridiculously strong!

07:54.391 --> 07:58.304
Babidi-sama, which warrior
will you choose for Stage Two?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.096
I choose Yakon.

08:02.315 --> 08:06.684
Yakon? You are already
using Yakon on Stage Two?

08:06.903 --> 08:10.771
I may not be giving those
earthlings enough credit.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.824
I mean, even Puipui was done in

08:14.035 --> 08:16.321
without doing the least bit of damage.

08:16.538 --> 08:21.999
lndeed. But against Yakon,
all of them will be defeated in no time,

08:22.210 --> 08:24.496
and I will not get any enjoyment out of them.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.080
Right now, awakening Majin Boo
from his long slumber

08:28.300 --> 08:31.337
comes before your enjoyment, doesn't it?

08:31.553 --> 08:34.544
Yes, sir. I profusely apologize.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.722
Stage Two will be Yakon! Pass it along!

08:37.933 --> 08:39.434
Yes, sir!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.192
Ya kon-sama!

09:06.755 --> 09:08.541
Yakon!

09:10.217 --> 09:13.175
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. You're on.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.297
Fight to your heart's content.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.095
Yes, Babidi-sama.

09:20.227 --> 09:23.890
Hey, what's the holdup?! Hurry on out here!

09:24.105 --> 09:25.845
This is pointless. Why don't we
smash through the floor

09:26.066 --> 09:27.476
and head all the way down right now?

09:27.692 --> 09:32.106
Y-You mustn't! Like I said earlier,
with any strong shock,

09:32.322 --> 09:34.688
Majin Boo will emerge,
even if not at full power.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.739
Hmph, the way things have been going,

09:36.952 --> 09:40.536
I'll bet this Majin Boo guy
isn't all that great, is he?

09:40.747 --> 09:42.453
Kind of the way that Dabra punk isn't?

09:42.666 --> 09:46.875
Huh? Dabra is not all that great?
What do you mean?

09:47.087 --> 09:50.545
I'm saying, this Dabra guy doesn't seem to be

09:50.757 --> 09:54.124
the badass that you all fear him to be.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.586
From watching his moves
and attacks outside earlier,

09:57.806 --> 10:01.094
as long as we minded his saliva,
we could have managed to take him.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.301
All I can say about Kibito
being done in is that he blew it.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.888
l-ls this true, Son Goku-san?

10:08.108 --> 10:12.101
Mm-hmm. Well, yeah, even supposing
that ain't his full power.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.107
We may have thought he was a
fearsome opponent before, though.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.700
Seven years ago, there was a guy named Cell,

10:17.909 --> 10:20.241
and he's about as strong
as that guy, more than likely.

10:20.453 --> 10:26.414
U-Unbelievable! Are Super Saiyans
really as amazing as that?

10:26.626 --> 10:29.914
Come to think of it,
when Son Gohan-san went Super Saiyan,

10:30.130 --> 10:33.418
it was fairly difficult to keep him from moving.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.296
Even at that, was he still not at his full power?

10:57.449 --> 10:59.405
What is that thing?!

11:04.205 --> 11:05.911
Th-That's...

11:07.667 --> 11:12.457
Yakon, you take down all three
of those guys for sure this time!

11:35.195 --> 11:38.437
Wow, you've gotten a remarkable one, huh?

11:39.574 --> 11:42.441
Which one of you shall I eat first?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.656
You're going to face me.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.330
You're a huge one, but you seem a little dim.

11:49.542 --> 11:53.911
l-lt could possibly be Yakon--
the magical beast Maju Yakon.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.290
Maju Yakon?

11:55.507 --> 11:57.623
Yes. An outrageously powerful creature,

11:57.842 --> 12:00.049
one of the dreaded magical space beasts.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.172
Goku-san, fighting him alone would be...

12:04.849 --> 12:08.888
Yakon, steal away their energy!

12:09.104 --> 12:12.562
Hurry and revive Majin Boo for me.

12:40.677 --> 12:44.420
Whew! That was close!

12:47.725 --> 12:51.013
Ho! He's huge, but nimble, huh?

12:51.229 --> 12:54.062
Did I not say so?! Let's all fight him together!

12:54.274 --> 12:59.143
Huh? Oh, no. I think we are absolutely
fine with Father fighting him alone.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.148
Y-You can't mean...!

13:02.157 --> 13:07.197
Well evaded! But you
won't be so lucky this time!

13:07.412 --> 13:12.031
Wow, you amazed me! You can pop
out those sickle-like claws, huh?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.284
He's spooked, he's spooked!

13:16.504 --> 13:19.996
Now to spook him even more,
and end this fight in one shot!

13:20.216 --> 13:22.207
Good, Yakon!

13:22.427 --> 13:24.713
Just what I expected!

13:24.929 --> 13:28.046
Leave Kaioshin out,
but you can kill the other three!

13:28.266 --> 13:30.973
Get all sorts of energy out of them!

13:31.186 --> 13:34.599
Then, without a doubt,
Majin Boo will be revived!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.520
In order to end this fight quickly,

13:36.733 --> 13:39.520
I'm about to bring you along to Planet Ankoku,

13:39.736 --> 13:42.694
your favorite world of darkness, okay?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.527
Babidi-sama, Yakon could easily beat them,

13:46.743 --> 13:49.075
even without them being on Planet Ankoku.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.996
Maybe. But if they fight inside the spaceship,

13:53.208 --> 13:55.540
and there happen to be any
powerful shocks to the ship,

13:55.752 --> 13:59.165
Majin Boo could come out without
reaching his full power first.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.245
If we're going to do this at all,
we want him to come back

14:01.466 --> 14:03.627
at his original, mighty level
of power, don't we?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.379
Yes, indeed.

14:06.596 --> 14:09.178
Okay, let's give this a go!

14:11.100 --> 14:15.514
Papparapa!!

14:24.614 --> 14:26.730
Hey, hey, hey, hey! This darkness is so great,

14:26.950 --> 14:30.488
we really can't see a thing, can we?
What are we gonna do?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.749
This is my beloved Planet Ankoku.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.422
I can see you all just fine!

14:44.634 --> 14:47.250
You're scratching your head
right now, aren't you?

14:47.470 --> 14:48.255
Huh?

14:48.471 --> 14:49.460
Planet Ankoku?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.296
The world where Yakon was raised.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.926
It is at the fringes of the universe,

14:53.142 --> 14:56.475
where sunlight does not reach.
As such, it is always in darkness.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.723
Oh, yeah?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.270
You're mine!

14:59.482 --> 15:01.347
I'll start with you!

15:08.575 --> 15:10.486
W-Where are you?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.904
Over here!

15:29.470 --> 15:32.177
C-Can you tell what is going on?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.426
Yeah, mostly.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.575
Can you see?

15:54.787 --> 15:59.076
You've taken us too lightly.
Even when it's pitch black,

15:59.292 --> 16:02.125
I can at least tell how
you're moving quite well.

16:02.337 --> 16:05.124
Using the slight changes
in air currents, and so forth.

16:05.340 --> 16:08.673
Besides, there are all sorts of ways to see you.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.505
For example...

16:19.395 --> 16:22.603
W-What is he doing?! What's going on?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.067
H-He looks different than before!

16:25.276 --> 16:28.643
Oh, he is simply glowing.

16:28.863 --> 16:33.983
Hey, bring me my energy meter!
The strongest meter l have!

16:34.202 --> 16:35.692
Yes, sir!

16:47.340 --> 16:49.877
lt's brighter now. That's my father for you.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.425
Well? Now do you see?

16:52.637 --> 16:55.754
However dark you make it,
it ain't gonna do any good.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.019
| see. It's clear now that
making things dark won't work.

17:03.231 --> 17:06.940
Huh? For some reason,
he ain't too scared by this.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.652
Babidi-sama!

17:13.156 --> 17:14.738
3,000 kilis?!

17:14.951 --> 17:19.411
H-How can an earthling
have 3,000 kilis of energy?!

17:19.622 --> 17:20.906
3,000 kilis...

17:21.124 --> 17:24.833
With only 200 or 300 kilis,
you can destroy a planet or two.

17:25.044 --> 17:29.083
That is unusual. There is no reason
why such people should exist.

17:29.298 --> 17:35.043
Is the meter malfunctioning?
But then, if it really is 3,000 kilis,

17:35.263 --> 17:37.424
then there's no way Yakon can beat that guy.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.552
Yakon's energy is 800 kilis, after all.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.601
I still win!

17:58.953 --> 18:01.365
W-What is this?!

18:21.476 --> 18:22.966
Huh?

18:24.854 --> 18:27.687
Huh? lt's utterly dark once again.

18:27.899 --> 18:31.562
Wrong. He was changed back
from being Super Saiyan.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.362
That was good.

18:36.574 --> 18:40.863
I've never eaten light that was so tasty
and had such volume before.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.067
Eaten?

18:42.288 --> 18:45.906
M-Maju Yakon feeds on light energy.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.707
The energy of Son Goku-san
when he went Super Saiyan

18:48.920 --> 18:50.911
was indeed a top-notch meal!

18:51.964 --> 18:55.252
Father! Don't turn Super Saiyan anymore!

18:55.468 --> 18:58.756
That thing apparently devours light energy!

19:01.182 --> 19:06.017
That is correct. If possible,
I wish you could feed me once again.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.345
That light was first-rate stuff.

19:08.564 --> 19:12.102
Huh? You're a weird one, huh?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.028
Fine. l'll treat you to even more.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.530
What?

19:23.746 --> 19:24.781
Here goes!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.113
What is he thinking?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.915
Father! l'll fight, too! With the two of us,

19:30.127 --> 19:32.584
we can beat him without
having to turn Super Saiyan!

19:32.797 --> 19:36.415
Nope. I'll do this alone! Keep out of it!

19:39.178 --> 19:40.714
Yay!

19:40.930 --> 19:44.468
I'm so glad you're such an idiot!
I'll just chow down again!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.595
Th-This really is foolish!

19:46.811 --> 19:50.645
W-Why are you so hung up
on fighting all by yourself?

19:50.857 --> 19:52.768
This is not a game!

19:52.984 --> 19:57.819
Be quiet and let him do it.
Kakarrot has something in mind.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.736
He's no fool.

20:03.870 --> 20:08.614
He's sucking me in!
But he ain't getting the best of me!

20:13.212 --> 20:14.588
Yakon, you moron!

20:14.797 --> 20:18.790
What's the point of you absorbing
his energy?! What a waste!

20:19.010 --> 20:21.877
It has to be energy taken
by delivering damage,

20:22.096 --> 20:24.803
or Majin Boo can't absorb it, you know!

21:02.053 --> 21:03.384
A-Amazing!

21:03.596 --> 21:05.507
Father, you did it!

21:07.308 --> 21:08.844
So that's it, huh?

21:09.852 --> 21:10.807
Wha--?!

21:11.020 --> 21:12.556
Impossible...

21:19.362 --> 21:21.023
Oh? It opened, it opened!

21:21.238 --> 21:23.024
We can go to the floor below us!

21:23.240 --> 21:24.741
Right!

21:26.327 --> 21:28.818
Goku is strong, all right!

21:29.038 --> 21:31.324
Having easily defeated
the magical beast Yakon,

21:31.540 --> 21:35.624
the four of them proceed to the third stage.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.438
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.654 --> 22:45.815
We've broken through
Stage Two, huh? By the way,

22:46.032 --> 22:49.240
I wonder what's happening
right now at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

22:49.452 --> 22:52.489
l, the world champion,
am not grabbing any attention at all!

22:52.705 --> 22:55.287
l have to come up with a clever idea!

22:55.499 --> 22:57.114
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.334 --> 23:00.952
"Whither Victory? A Battle Royal
Championship Match!!"

23:01.172 --> 23:04.005
Come to think of it, I didn't see
Trunks or Goten around.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.717
I hope they're all right.

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
