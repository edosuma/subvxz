WEBVTT

00:34.868 --> 00:37.829
How are we supposed
to introduce ourselves to the neighbors

00:37.912 --> 00:39.372
if they never leave the house?

00:39.622 --> 00:41.291
Well, it's been three weeks.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.668
If we don't do it soon,
we're gonna be forced

00:43.752 --> 00:46.880
into giving them awkward waves
and avoiding eye contact

00:46.963 --> 00:50.175
-until someone dies or moves away.
Oh, shoot.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.259
Look, they're leaving.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.552
Oh. Hello.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.680
Hi, neighbors. I'm Peggy Hill.
I want to welcome you...

00:55.764 --> 00:56.848
Oh.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.144
I feel awful that none of us
have welcomed them

01:01.227 --> 01:02.520
into the neighborhood yet.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.066
Heck, by this time, we had already given
Kahn a housewarming gift

01:06.149 --> 01:07.525
and started hating him.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.403
Wait, you haven't met Lila and Jim?

01:10.487 --> 01:13.740
I just cleaned out all the pests
in their attic free of charge.

01:13.823 --> 01:16.284
Nothing says,
"Welcome to the Neighborhood"

01:16.367 --> 01:19.079
as well as a gunnysack
full of dead squirrels.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.538
You've met them already?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.749
And you've already killed stuff for them?

01:22.832 --> 01:25.418
You shouldn't be afraid of them.
They're really nice.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.004
They let me use their bathroom,
no questions asked.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.882
Ah, man, it don't take nothin'
but a got dang ol' second, man.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.842
Just talkin' bout an ol' "Welcome
to the neighborhood," man.

01:32.926 --> 01:33.760
You know, done.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.053

I know how to welcome

01:35.178 --> 01:36.638
new neighbors, Boomhauer.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.558
Hey.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.771
-
Who you waving at?

01:44.854 --> 01:46.564
They're strangers to you.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.316
Peggy.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.821
Hank, do you want the last
of the cookies Bill made us?

01:52.904 --> 01:55.698
-Mine.
-Caleb. That was for our guests.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.660
That boy sure has a mind of his own.

01:58.743 --> 01:59.619


01:59.702 --> 02:00.787
Hey, he's quick, too.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.080
And he's only ten?

02:02.163 --> 02:04.040
-Wow, he's as big as Bobby.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.168
Hey, Bobby?
Why don't you toss the ball with Caleb?

02:08.002 --> 02:09.087
Okay.

02:13.508 --> 02:14.384
Uh...

02:14.634 --> 02:16.177
Bobby didn't limber up.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.938
-What'd you forget at the market?
-Dale, there are dead squirrels

02:27.021 --> 02:28.648
sitting on my cottage cheese.

02:28.731 --> 02:29.983
Don't blame me,

02:30.066 --> 02:31.484
blame the city dump.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.902
They raised their fees,

02:32.986 --> 02:36.281
so I have to save up the carcasses
in order to be economical.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.533
Get them out, Dale.

02:45.498 --> 02:49.836
I'm guessing you don't want this guy
camping out in the freezer then, huh?

02:53.256 --> 02:54.174
Hmm?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.135
"Taxidermy."

02:58.219 --> 03:00.221
Hey, I have a lot of dead animals.

03:00.305 --> 03:04.434
I'll make a killing stuffing them
after I've made a killing killing them.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.520
This better be leftovers, Dale.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.314
Uh, let me take that.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.364
Gentlemen, who wants to get
their Christmas shopping out of the way?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.746
Dang it, Dale,
get those filthy things off our cooler.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.831
We keep beer in there, for God's sake.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.082
Relax, Hank.

03:28.166 --> 03:32.545
They've been boiled, scrubbed, de-boned,
powdered and stuffed with surgical cotton.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.172
They're cleaner than Bill.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.716
Hmm. That one in the middle
is staring at me.

03:36.799 --> 03:38.843
Dale, we're gonna take a two-minute walk.

03:38.927 --> 03:39.886
When we come back,

03:39.969 --> 03:43.264
I want those things gone
and the cooler sanitized.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.814
Did you make this, Dale?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.358
I already know, it's horrible.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.276
No. No, no, I like it.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.613
It just seems like it needs more... oomph.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.406
Who was this squirrel?

04:00.490 --> 04:03.576
Was he a climber? A jumper?
Did he take chances?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.078
There you go.

04:05.161 --> 04:09.040
Now there is a story being told
about how tasty his little acorn is.

04:09.123 --> 04:14.379
My God, that is exactly how he looked
when I killed him in the first place.

04:14.837 --> 04:17.257
Hey, I've got a crow defrosting.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.008
Like to take a crack at him?

04:19.092 --> 04:20.260
Lead the way.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.306
What are you building?

04:25.390 --> 04:28.184
Oh. Oh. Oh, Caleb.
Uh, I didn't know you were there.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.853
I'm building a shelf for my paint cans.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.148
Thanks for asking. You know, Bobby
never showed much interest in...

04:34.941 --> 04:36.609
Uh... Be careful there, Caleb.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.195
That's a measuring instrument,
not a yo-yo.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.780
You don't want to kink the tape,

04:40.863 --> 04:43.366
or it won't retract back into its housing.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.867
Thunder!

04:47.245 --> 04:48.579
Now, now, listen, son,

04:48.663 --> 04:51.249
this is a workplace,
not a playground, okay?

04:51.332 --> 04:54.627
If you want me to teach you
how to use that saw properly,

04:54.711 --> 04:56.379
I'd be more than happy to show you.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.757
Now, Caleb, when sawing wood...

05:00.216 --> 05:02.385
Okay. Okay, don't panic.

05:02.468 --> 05:03.594
Accidents happen.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.680
Uh, let me grab my shop towels.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.396
No, Caleb, you need to dab.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.524
You're smearing.
You've got to lift the towel...

05:18.443 --> 05:21.029
Uh... Uh, you know what, Caleb?

05:21.321 --> 05:24.866
Just forget it, I, I'm gonna tackle
this mess by myself, okay?

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453
Okay then.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.718
Uh, hello, Caleb.

05:44.093 --> 05:47.055
-What are you doing?
-I'm watering the lawn.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.933
Caleb, no, you don't ride on a lawn,

05:51.017 --> 05:52.310
especially when it's wet.

05:53.102 --> 05:54.354
I like nicknames.

05:54.604 --> 05:55.938
Call me "C-Unit."

05:56.022 --> 05:58.399
Uh, okay, C-Unit.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.027
Yeah.

06:01.235 --> 06:02.904
Now you need a nickname.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.074
I got it, "Dusty old bones."

06:06.157 --> 06:07.283
Yeah. Yeah.

06:07.367 --> 06:11.913
Uh. Yeah, I think "Mr. Hill"
is probably the best way to go.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.540
<i>♪ Dusty old bones full of green dust ♪</i>

06:14.624 --> 06:17.502
<i>♪ Dusty old bones full of green dust ♪</i>

06:18.127 --> 06:19.712
"Green dust?"

06:21.255 --> 06:25.093
"Dusty old bones, full of green dust"?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.803
What kind of nickname is that?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
Sounds like a pretty crappy one to me,

06:29.138 --> 06:31.307
considering how much
he's got to work with.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.600
Hey, old man.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.561
Dusty old bones, full of green dust.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.688
Does that seem funny to any of you?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.690
No, but it is rather catchy.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.276
I don't get it, why did he pick on me?

06:42.360 --> 06:44.862
I mean, Dale has a dead possum
on his shoulder,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.906
and Caleb completely ignored it.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.324
-Got it.
-What in the...

06:48.658 --> 06:51.869
Caleb, get back here.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.540
My God, you just opened that beer.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.584
You gonna cry, dusty old bones?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.504
Wait, I recognize this.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.714
They pick on you,
they mess with your stuff,

07:03.965 --> 07:05.007
he's a bully.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.009
He's your bully, Hank.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.262
-What?
-White shirt. White shirt.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.889
How'd you get your shirt so white,
white shirt?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.183
Yep. And a weird bully at that.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.400
So, this is your bully stain.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.610
I do not have a bully.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.778
I am an adult.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.865
Adults can't be bullied
by ten-year-old kids.

07:28.948 --> 07:32.493
Yeah, you sure talk a big game
when Caleb's not around.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.246
Man, you gonna take that from him, man?

07:35.329 --> 07:37.832
Just grab a rag and shut up, both of you.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.958
Fair enough.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.255
It's beautiful.

07:44.338 --> 07:46.507
Absolutely beautiful.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.261
Peggy, you're the Hemingway
of the taxidermy diorama.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.262
Oh, thanks.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.098
And you, Dale, are the Mozart
of that suction thingy

07:54.182 --> 07:55.391
that removes all the guts.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.936
Do you really think it's good?

07:59.395 --> 08:01.522
I think it's this good.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.406
Excuse me.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.409
Is this where we sign up
for the taxidermy competition?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.702
Yes, it is, ma'am.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.205
Is, uh, that your entry?

08:17.288 --> 08:19.582
You, sir, are looking at first place.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.464
So, that's gonna be first place, huh?

08:26.547 --> 08:29.550
Before you sign up, why don't you two
take a look at last year's winner.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.639
Man.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.725
There's more than pipe cleaners
holding that sucker together.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.936
We don't stand a chance.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.354
Oh, yes, we do.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.148
Dale, you've got to find me bigger game.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.402
Ah, you've got to be kidding me.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.405
Who's gonna lick a stamp
that has Bill Clinton on it?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.324
I'm only telling you what I've heard.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.120
Uh, Caleb,

08:58.204 --> 09:01.582
this is not proper behavior
when two adults are trying to speak.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.584
Why don't you play with that
somewhere else?

09:06.337 --> 09:10.800
So, anyway, yeah, why don't they
put Dale Earnhardt on a stamp?

09:10.883 --> 09:13.344
I mean, he won seven Winston Cup...

09:13.427 --> 09:16.305
All right, Caleb,
I'm gonna count to three.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.768
One, two...

09:20.851 --> 09:22.019
Three.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.521
Uh, three.

09:26.440 --> 09:30.486
Ah, Hank, I better be getting on my way.
I... See you later.

09:42.164 --> 09:43.249
Hey, Hank.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.084
We're really looking forward
to your barbecue.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.752
So, uh...

09:46.961 --> 09:49.380
I want to talk to you about, uh, Caleb.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.257
He's been, kind of, uh...

09:51.632 --> 09:52.675
teasing me.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.928
Oh, teasing's just his way
of showing how much he likes you.

09:56.012 --> 09:59.557
Yeah, uh, actually,
it's, it's more than just teasing.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.475
It, it's more like harassing.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.436
That's just his way of testing you.

10:03.519 --> 10:04.729
You know how kids are.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.606
He's just so smart.

10:06.689 --> 10:09.191
The best thing to do
when he gets that way is to ignore him.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.944
Uh, well, he's kind of hard to ignore

10:12.028 --> 10:15.531
when he's whacking a little red ball
right next to your head.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.033
Caleb.

10:24.999 --> 10:25.916
Hey, Peggy.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.376
Oh, good, you're back.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.254
What have you got?

10:30.338 --> 10:34.383
Um, so you know how there's
never anything big and dead around

10:34.467 --> 10:35.801
when you need it?

10:38.387 --> 10:40.222
Three groundhogs and...

10:40.306 --> 10:41.432
What the hell is that?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.267
Half a groundhog.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.192
Um...

10:51.776 --> 10:54.153
Hey, Dad, can I flip my burger?

10:54.236 --> 10:55.571
Uh, are you sure?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.782
You remember what happened
to that pancake.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.325
Oh, yeah.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.037
Uh, uh, Caleb.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.789
You, uh, you want a burger?

11:06.290 --> 11:09.502
Where are your parents anyway?

11:09.585 --> 11:11.128
Give me that hat, old man.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.713
What are you...

11:12.797 --> 11:15.216
Caleb, please stop grabbing at my hat.

11:15.299 --> 11:17.385
It's the property of Strickland Propane.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.553
Lila. Jim.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.180
Ah. Got it.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.432
Dang it, Caleb. Give me back my hat.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.316
Too slow, dusty old bones.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.194
I'm not playing, Caleb.
Give me my hat back.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.281
Keep-a-way.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.953
Can you believe that kid?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.204
Keep-a-way.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.497
Yeah.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.416
What the hell are you doing, Bill?

11:48.499 --> 11:50.334
Sorry, Hank, I just got all caught up.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.629
<i>♪ Dusty old bones, full of green dust ♪</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.799
Oh, look, Lila, Caleb wrote
another one of his songs.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.926
<i>♪ Dusty old bones, full of green dust ♪</i>

11:59.009 --> 12:01.095
He is so creative.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.450
Dance, old man. Dance.

12:25.828 --> 12:30.040
I made noise. I'm a superhero.
I'm Pop-Pop Man.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.670
You are way out of line, young man.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.265
You need to learn some manners.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.603
Caleb, get off the bike.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.986
Now, when you learn a little respect,
you'll get this back.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.123
Well, I took care of the Caleb situation.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.001
I admit, I almost lost it,
but then I realized

13:14.084 --> 13:17.421
he was just a kid and just
needed a little firm guidance.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.257
Well, at least something's going right.
How'd you do it?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.927
I just took his bike
and locked it in the garage.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.972
Yep, Caleb's gonna learn a big lesson

13:27.056 --> 13:29.642
when he has to come back here
and ask for that bike back.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.811
And he's gonna have to do it with respect.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.646
Hopefully, his parents will come along

13:33.729 --> 13:36.273
so they can learn a thing or two
about raising a kid.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.943
Oh, good, that's probably them now.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.948
I want my bike back.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.659
Well, you're gonna have to ask nicer
than that, Caleb.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.327
Oh, yeah?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.756
There it is, officers,
not a scratch on it.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.217
All I was trying to do was make a point.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.261
By stealing a ten-year-old's bike?

14:05.344 --> 14:06.720
What, are you a tough guy, huh?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.973
You want to try and take
something away from me, big boy?

14:09.056 --> 14:11.809
No. You've got it all wrong.
I'm the victim here.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.435
That kid is out of control,

14:13.519 --> 14:15.563
and his parents won't do anything
about it.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.606
Officers, could we please
have our son's bike back?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.608
We'd really just like
to get this behind us.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.111
Yes, sir. Give the boy back his bike.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.498
Here you go, Caleb.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.167
And he liked you so much.

14:53.517 --> 14:58.105
Hank, you can't hide in here forever.
Come out and have a beer with us.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.399
I'm not hiding, Bill.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.610
Hank, that's a lie, and we both know it.

15:02.693 --> 15:06.322
Now come on, if Caleb comes at you,
we'll all run away together.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.991
I'm not worried about Caleb. I'm just...

15:09.074 --> 15:10.534
I'm re-tacking the sofa.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.911
Sure, Hank.

15:12.161 --> 15:15.456
When you decide you're done "re-tacking,"
you give a holler.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.389
Wet old man.

15:35.893 --> 15:40.606
You know, it's a felony to use a mail slot
for anything other than mail?

15:44.276 --> 15:47.863
Dude. Dude, I'm Kelly Slater, dude. Dude.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.829
Uh, hey, uh,

15:55.913 --> 15:57.414
how would you guys like to make

15:57.498 --> 15:58.749
five bucks?

16:00.209 --> 16:03.837
All you have to do is put a little scare
into a pesky ten-year-old.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.255
Yeah, we'll do that, sure.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.424
If you can give us a ride
to the gas station,

16:07.508 --> 16:08.926
we'll take care of the rest.

16:09.009 --> 16:11.762
Just make sure his alarm system
at his house is turned off.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.931
Uh...

16:21.855 --> 16:23.315
Is that a deer?

16:23.399 --> 16:25.693
No, Dale, that is the picture

16:25.776 --> 16:27.695
on the sign... again.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.071
I can't believe this.

16:29.154 --> 16:32.700
Three deaf kids have already crossed here,
and not a single deer.

16:33.242 --> 16:34.868
I'm sorry, Peggy.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.745
I blew it again.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.623
I'm not worthy to work beside your genius.

16:39.707 --> 16:44.003
I'd say stuff me, but that would get us
Honorable Mention at best.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.672
-Oh, now, Dale.
-I'm sorry, Peggy.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.257
I failed you.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.051
I'm used to letting Hank down,
but not you.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.095
Dale, this is not your fault.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.889
I put you in a no-win situation.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.309
We've been looking
in all the wrong places.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.104
We shouldn't have been looking out there.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.440
We should have been looking in here.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.066
Come on, Dale.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.818
We got a contest to enter.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.907
-Yup.
-Yup.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.784
Mm-hmm.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.455
I just don't know what to do

17:19.538 --> 17:20.497
about Caleb.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.751
I feel helpless.
I can't physically stop him.

17:23.834 --> 17:26.628
His parents would have me arrested,
and they'd have a point.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.672
I mean, he's a kid, and I'm an adult.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.883
But someone needs to put him in his place.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.178
Too bad we're not little people.
Then it would be a fair fight.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.182
Bobby.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.143
You want me to do what?

17:41.226 --> 17:44.396
Look, I hate to ask you
to fight my battles for me, son,

17:44.480 --> 17:46.106
but I have no other choice.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.232
Will you do it?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.903
I can see that you really need my help,
Dad.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.988
I just don't think I can do it.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.032
It seems so wrong.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.077
Look, I know it goes against everything
I've taught you, Bobby,

17:58.160 --> 17:59.703
but I know you can do it.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.339
There he is, Bobby.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.387
Now go over there
and do exactly like I showed you.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.223
I can do this.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.266
I can do this.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.070
Holy smoke. What's going on?

18:33.153 --> 18:35.030
Snap, crackle, pop, Pops.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.365
Bobby, what are you doing?

18:37.449 --> 18:39.910
Hey, hey, that's a good way
to hurt someone.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.453
Please, stop doing that.

18:42.538 --> 18:44.164
A tisket, a tasket.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.999
There goes your basket.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.000
Hey.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.795
Cut that out, Bobby.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.130
Keep-away.

19:04.017 --> 19:06.603
Hello, Jim and Lila. What brings you here?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.438
Your son is out of control.

19:08.856 --> 19:11.525
Yep, Bobby's got a lot of spirit,
all right.

19:11.608 --> 19:15.571
Spirit? He spread trash all over our yard
and viciously attacked Jim.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.781
Well, he must really like you a lot.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.533
He's got a funny way of showing it.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.368
Well, if I were you,

19:21.451 --> 19:22.786
I'd just learn to ignore it,

19:22.870 --> 19:27.040
because once Bobby decides he likes you,
he's never gonna stop.

19:29.251 --> 19:33.547
If you're trying to compare Bobby
to our Caleb, you're way off base.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.049
Bobby is... is just a troublemaker.

19:36.133 --> 19:40.429
Caleb has a precocious sense of adventure.
He's expressive.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.764
He goes to the gifted magnet school.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.976
Well, good for him.
But I wouldn't sell Bobby short.

19:46.059 --> 19:49.146
I think he's about
to "express himself" right now.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.398
What you got in the squirt gun, son?

19:51.481 --> 19:54.985
That's for me to know
and Jim and Lila to find out.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.657
You folks want to find out?

20:00.741 --> 20:04.620
Or do you want to tell Caleb
to stop riding his bike on my lawn?

20:11.251 --> 20:14.546
Caleb, please don't ride
your bike on Mr. Hill's lawn.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.051
You mean dusty old bones?

20:19.134 --> 20:21.678
<i>♪ Dusty old bones, full of green dust ♪</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:23.013
<i>♪ Dusty old bones ♪</i>

20:23.096 --> 20:24.223
<i>♪ Full of green dust ♪</i>

20:24.306 --> 20:26.308
I mean it, son. Get off the grass!

20:44.826 --> 20:47.120
Gentlemen, prepare for greatness.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.830
<i>Voila.</i>

20:48.914 --> 20:51.792
The signing of the
"Declaration of Independence."

20:51.875 --> 20:56.755
We call it: "No Tax-i-dermy-ation
without Representation."

20:56.838 --> 20:58.173
You're gonna love this.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.425
Watch what happens
when Ben Franklin's kite

21:00.509 --> 21:02.010
gets hit by lightning.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.851
For that, I sincerely apologize.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.398
And that, too.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.936
-<i>Green dust?</i>
