00:03.041 --> 00:05.583
Erica: A resume,
it tells a story:

00:05.625 --> 00:07.542
school, job, hobbies,

00:07.583 --> 00:10.291
it's a snapshot of who we are.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.125
- What makes the best
impression?

00:12.166 --> 00:14.291
- The masters in English lit,
for sure.

00:14.333 --> 00:15.750
- Mmm, I don't know.
I don't know.

00:15.792 --> 00:17.250
- I think you should go
with work experience.

00:17.291 --> 00:20.083
I mean... client representative
has heft.

00:20.125 --> 00:23.375
- Heft? No it doesn't. I was
a glorified operator, Judith.

00:23.417 --> 00:25.333
- Okay, the masters then.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.709
Erica: And at the end
of the day,

00:26.750 --> 00:29.083
It all comes down to
the choices we've made.

00:29.125 --> 00:32.667
This, this is what I've done
with my life in ten years? Wow.

00:32.709 --> 00:35.667
- I did a huge Workopolis
search for you.

00:35.709 --> 00:37.917
- Thank you.
- Pulled out everything
I thought might interest you.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.709
- Okay, what do we go here?

00:39.750 --> 00:42.750
Um, jobs in education,
advertising,

00:44.458 --> 00:45.959
mortuary science?

00:46.625 --> 00:48.500
- Boomers are dying off.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.917
- Hey, wait a minute!
Publishing. I like books.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.709
- Yeah, you love books.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.792
That is why I included at least
a dozen publishing jobs.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.917
- I feel strangely excited.
- (Excited squeal)

00:59.542 --> 01:01.959
- Why don't you come over
tonight and celebrate?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.041
Ethan is coming to town from
Montreal, total last minute.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.625
The three of us will crack open
a bottle of wine...

01:06.667 --> 01:08.542
- Wine?
- Or fizzy grape juice stuff?
I'm so sorry.

01:11.417 --> 01:13.250
- It's okay.
- Worst friend ever.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.709
Have you told anyone, yet?
- Um, no.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.500
I'm gonna wait until the end
of the first trimester, so.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.333
- Okay, hey, mums the word.
- Okay.

01:19.375 --> 01:21.709
All right, I'm gonna get changed
and hand deliver these suckers.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.917
- All right.
- Thank you so much.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.500
Erica: Choices.

01:25.542 --> 01:28.667
Look close enough and you
can see them everywhere.

01:28.709 --> 01:30.208
But what do you do
When you see your life

01:30.250 --> 01:33.583
as a series of bad choices?

01:33.625 --> 01:36.000
When you would give anything
to have made different ones.

01:36.041 --> 01:37.542
The questions is:

01:37.583 --> 01:39.667
If you could go back
and do it all differently,

01:39.709 --> 01:41.458
would you still be you?

01:41.500 --> 01:44.041
- Oh. Sorry. My apologies.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.583
Hi, there.
- Hi, can I help you?

01:50.625 --> 01:52.250
- Yes, I'm just here
to drop off a resume

01:52.291 --> 01:53.667
for the assistant position.

01:53.709 --> 01:55.500
- The assistant position.

01:55.542 --> 01:58.166
- The assistant to the managing
editor of fiction.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.667
Okay.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.834
- Right, so, just contact
4 or 5 blurbers

02:02.875 --> 02:04.542
for the pre-publication
endorsements,

02:04.583 --> 02:07.458
see if they'd be willing
to... uh...

02:07.500 --> 02:09.583
Oh, I'll see you in a sec.
Erica Strange.

02:11.333 --> 02:14.750
- Oh... Antigone Kim.
- It's Antigone Morris now.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.375
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Thanks.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.834
- So, uh...so,
do you work here?

02:18.875 --> 02:21.417
Yeah. I head up Green Row's
Fiction division.

02:21.458 --> 02:24.125
(Laughs) Wow, so, um...

02:24.166 --> 02:26.208
Seeing you again is just...

02:26.250 --> 02:27.667
I don't know, it's crazy, huh?

02:27.709 --> 02:29.959
Yeah, it's really crazy.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.625
Oh my God, do you remember
all those pompous debates

02:31.667 --> 02:33.583
we used to have about the,
God, whatever.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.458
- Right. We were really
competitive back in the day,
you know?

02:36.500 --> 02:39.166
Sometimes it's great to read
a book just to read a book.

02:39.208 --> 02:41.542
- Yeah. Not if you wanna be
an editor.

02:41.583 --> 02:44.500
- Yeah... Um...

02:44.542 --> 02:46.500
So, how did you end up
in publishing?

02:46.542 --> 02:48.417
Well, do you remember literati?

02:48.458 --> 02:50.709
That "not so secret" society
I was in?

02:50.750 --> 02:52.542
- Yes, they tapped me to join
as well.

02:52.583 --> 02:54.542
- That's right. Yeah-yeah-yeah.

02:54.583 --> 02:56.291
My boss here? Is a literati.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.166
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.208
Literati members
like to help each other.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.166
And it doesn't hurt to have
friends in high places,

03:02.208 --> 03:04.083
if know what I mean?

03:04.125 --> 03:06.542
- Mmm.
- So, um...

03:10.417 --> 03:12.500
Oh, you're applying for a job...
to be my assistant.

03:17.542 --> 03:20.208
- Yeah, I'm kind of
in the middle of a career
change right now. So...

03:21.792 --> 03:24.500
- Unfortunately, that
position's been filled.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.875
- Uh, I just hired
this bright young thing,

03:26.917 --> 03:28.750
right out of her masters.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.375
- Let me guess, literati?

03:31.417 --> 03:33.709
Well, we are the sum of our
decisions, aren't we?

03:35.125 --> 03:36.750
- Yeah.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.250
- (Polite laughter)

03:38.291 --> 03:40.458
As long as you're happy
that's all that matters.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.583
It was really great
seeing you again. Bye.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.041
(Clomp of withdrawing heels)

03:55.458 --> 03:59.291
- "We're the sum of our
decisions, aren't we?"

03:59.333 --> 04:01.417
I guess we are.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.417
Dr. Tom?

04:05.208 --> 04:08.417
Hey, Dr. Tom!

04:08.458 --> 04:11.500
Whaaa! (Tires screech)
Man: Ah!

05:06.542 --> 05:09.417
It's 15 years old.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.333
Erica: I know, but the
suspension scattered
all over Bedford road.

05:11.375 --> 05:13.375
I mean, I either give it up
or I pay the money.

05:13.417 --> 05:14.792
Oh my God. Sam, that dress
is gorgeous.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.667
I like it.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.458
- All that running around
and nobody even called you
for an interview?

05:19.500 --> 05:21.375
- (stammering)
I'm still trying to look.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.583
Can't expect me to find
something in one day.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.750
Uncle Ruby: Well, if it doesn't
work out, you can always work
for me.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.333
- (half laughs)
Come work for you?

05:28.375 --> 05:30.542
- Well, our Toronto account
executive just retired,

05:30.583 --> 05:33.041
if you can handle
lunches at Holt's,

05:33.083 --> 05:34.792
and martinis with wedding
planners.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.667
- Oh, Erica loves martinis.
- Mom.

05:37.709 --> 05:40.667
- We offer competitive wages
and, uh, benefits.
- Dental.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.542
- Look, I don't even know
anything about weddings, people.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.458
- Well, what's there to know?

05:44.500 --> 05:47.041
Boy meets girl, boy woos girl,

05:47.083 --> 05:49.250
girl blows $10,000 on a lovely
pile of lace and organza.

05:50.792 --> 05:52.208
- Oh, save your breath, Ruby.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.625
My daughter thinks she's
too good to work

05:53.667 --> 05:55.041
for your successful business.
- I do not!

05:55.083 --> 05:57.417
- Mom, leave her alone.
- Thank you, Sam.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.500
- I'm just saying, she might
wanna consider saying yes

05:59.542 --> 06:00.959
to her uncle who's trying
to help her.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.500
- I'm not saying no.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.458
Would you just give me
a second to think about it.

06:05.458 --> 06:08.792
Look, uncle Ruby, if I were
to come and work for you,

06:08.834 --> 06:11.375
I mean, it would just be a
temporary thing and I'd...

06:11.417 --> 06:12.750
I'd like to be up front
about that.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.291
- Be up front all you want.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.542
All I'm saying is
it's a good group of people,

06:16.583 --> 06:18.291
we have a lot of laughs,
you'd enjoy yourself.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.333
- When can Erica start?
- Mom.

06:29.792 --> 06:31.667
(Ethan's cell phone rings)

06:35.000 --> 06:36.500
(Phone rings)

06:37.959 --> 06:40.583
(Key beeps)

06:40.625 --> 06:42.625
Erica: Ethan!

06:44.750 --> 06:47.500
- Hey.
- Oh, I am so sorry.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.709
It's just... the craziest day.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.417
(Excited groans)

06:51.458 --> 06:53.709
- And you're always late.
- I know, I know.

06:55.208 --> 06:56.709
What, are you moving in?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.625
Um, yeah. I thought I'd sleep
in your bathtub.

06:58.667 --> 07:00.000
- (Laughs)

07:01.667 --> 07:03.959
I did not have a poster
of "the kiss" up on my wall.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.917
- Yes, you did.
It was right above your desk.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.083
- No, that was Judith.
- No, that was you.

07:08.125 --> 07:09.834
- You bought it at that
poster sale in first year.

07:09.875 --> 07:11.583
- Why are you my friend again?

07:11.625 --> 07:14.291
And do I need to remind
you about the, uh,
toaster oven incident?

07:14.333 --> 07:15.917
- No, but you're going to.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.458
- Who installs a heat source
underneath their bed?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.667
Uh, oh, that's right, you do.

07:20.709 --> 07:22.875
- Like I'm gonna get out of bed
to make nachos.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.750
And that, my friend,
is the last of it.

07:26.291 --> 07:27.792
I start a new job tomorrow, so,

07:27.834 --> 07:29.583
no hangover for this girl.

07:29.625 --> 07:31.000
- A new job? Doing what?

07:31.041 --> 07:32.709
- Um, account executive.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.583
At my uncle Ruby's Bridal
company; "White Dreams".

07:36.041 --> 07:37.625
- Wet dreams?

07:37.667 --> 07:39.667
- White dreams, you perv.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.542
- (Chuckles) Well,
congratulations. I guess.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.709
No, I mean, it's,
It's gonna be great.

07:44.750 --> 07:46.583
It's, uh... pays the bills,
it's downtown,

07:48.083 --> 07:50.875
there's dental!

07:50.917 --> 07:52.583
You're, you're just
not happy for me at all.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.500
- Sorry, I can't go
"rah-rah-rah"

07:55.542 --> 07:57.083
over something you think
is a mistake.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.542
- Huh! Okay, Mr. Honesty,

07:59.583 --> 08:02.333
what's with all the luggage?

08:02.375 --> 08:03.917
- Well, um...

08:05.750 --> 08:07.333
I left Claire.

08:08.917 --> 08:10.834
- Oh my God, Ethan,
what happened?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.333
She was cheating on me.
- What?!

08:13.834 --> 08:15.291
Okay, that's bullshit.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.834
She was cheating on you,
and you had to leave?

08:17.875 --> 08:20.041
- Well, her dad owns
half the city of Montreal.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.041
He bought us our house
in Outremont.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.000
All our friends
are her friends.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.000
Feels like there's nothing
left there for me.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.500
- So, where are you gonna stay?

08:29.083 --> 08:30.542
- My parents have a granny
suite.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.500
- No, you're not gonna stay
in your parents' basement,

08:32.542 --> 08:34.583
you're gonna stay here with me.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.125
Where? I... I was joking
about the tub.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.875
This place is too small.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.000
- Okay, we'll... we'll find
somewhere.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.500
We'll look and we'll get you
a place.

08:43.125 --> 08:44.959
I promise you, I'm gonna get
you sorted out.

08:46.458 --> 08:47.792
I know.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.792
(Seagulls cry)

08:52.834 --> 08:54.083
(Low whir of traffic)

08:59.959 --> 09:02.750
- Good morning.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.458
Ungh! Ow!

09:12.917 --> 09:14.750
(Magnetic card reader beeps)
It's magnetic.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.542
(Laughs)

09:24.125 --> 09:26.125
Uncle Ruby: Okay, yeah,
this way, through here.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.583
Now your catchment zone
is gonna be the downtown core.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.125
That's home to some of the most
discerning bridal houses
in the city.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.792
So you're gonna be dealing
with people who are...

09:34.834 --> 09:38.333
Well, okay, they can be
prissy little pains in my ass.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.792
Do I ever get to meet
any real bridezillas?

09:41.834 --> 09:44.125
- Oh no-oh, no-no-no-no-no,
No, no, no.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.166
We don't have to get our hands
dirty with any that.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.041
"White dreams" is strictly
import/export.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.750
- Okay.
- Ah, now, here you are,
right through here.

09:53.792 --> 09:56.500
Go on. Sit down.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.125
- Make yourself at home.
- All right.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.875
- This is your domain.

10:01.291 --> 10:06.083
It's best that you get to know
each our dresses by name, okay?

10:06.125 --> 10:08.667
- Okay.
- Talk amongst yourselves.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.166
- Okay.

10:11.208 --> 10:12.625
All right.

10:14.166 --> 10:17.083
(Gasps) The ivory tower, mm-hmm.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.041
The snow fairy.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.500
The virgin queen.

10:21.959 --> 10:23.291
Yeah, right.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.000
Um.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.500
Gah! (stunned gasp)

10:37.000 --> 10:38.709
Good morning, Erica.

10:38.750 --> 10:40.834
How... what are you doing
in the girls washroom?

10:40.875 --> 10:42.834
Why... why isn't this
the girls washroom?

10:42.875 --> 10:44.500
I... I was just at work and...

10:45.959 --> 10:47.333
- White Dreams.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.834
Such an evocative name.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.750
- What? What?

10:53.458 --> 10:55.625
- Okay, just before you go
this is something from...

10:55.667 --> 10:57.500
- (Squeals)

10:59.125 --> 11:01.166
- You've got that out
of your system, have you?

11:01.208 --> 11:02.583
- Yeah.

11:02.625 --> 11:04.041
- (Laughs) Good.

11:04.083 --> 11:06.166
- Please, come. Sit down.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.792
- Sit down?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.291
I-I, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.625
I mean, I have a million
questions.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.208
- I can imagine.

11:12.250 --> 11:15.083
- You sent me back in time.
- Indeed.

11:15.125 --> 11:18.166
Very glamorous, I know.
- How did you do it?

11:18.208 --> 11:21.291
No, I mean, more importantly,
why, why, why did you pick me?

11:21.709 --> 11:23.458
Samuel Johnson said,

11:23.500 --> 11:28.000
"The use of traveling
is to regulate imagination
by reality,

11:28.041 --> 11:31.000
and instead of thinking
how things may be,

11:31.041 --> 11:33.375
to see them as they are."

11:34.375 --> 11:35.834
- Okay...

11:37.291 --> 11:38.667
- Okay.

11:40.250 --> 11:43.208
Tell me about regret number
seven.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.709
- Tell me why you picked me.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.166
- Well, why not you?
Is your life so insignificant?

11:47.208 --> 11:48.750
- No, but I--

11:48.792 --> 11:50.709
Oh, well, good then.
Your list, please.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.834
Hold on, hold on, I have some
questions to ask

11:52.875 --> 11:56.000
and I think, at the very least,
I'm entitled to ask them,

11:56.041 --> 11:58.208
I mean, you kind of made me
destroy my car.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.667
- Erica, we made a contract.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.667
And in order for that
contract to work,

12:03.709 --> 12:05.625
you have to trust me.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.834
- I do.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.959
And you have to trust that
my number one regret is Leo.

12:12.333 --> 12:14.458
Please send me back to him.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.875
I mean, I can, I can warn him.
- No you can't.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.291
You can't go back to fix
other peoples' mistakes.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.125
And you can't go back
to win the lottery,

12:24.166 --> 12:26.375
or to bet on the Stanley cup,

12:26.417 --> 12:28.291
or to save your brother's life.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.917
This, Erica, is about you.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.875
It's your list,
it's your regrets.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.875
It's you.

12:38.917 --> 12:41.208
So, tell me about...

12:41.250 --> 12:42.792
number seven.

12:42.834 --> 12:44.667
Secret society.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.291
- Okay.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.250
Okay. (Exhales)

12:52.291 --> 12:54.041
Secret society. Wow. (chuckles)

12:55.542 --> 12:56.834
Um...it was 1995,

12:58.458 --> 13:01.083
I was in my second year
at university,

13:01.125 --> 13:03.458
and I thought that
I knew everything.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.125
Normally, I'm not one
for confrontation,

13:06.166 --> 13:08.208
But when it came to books
and literature,

13:08.250 --> 13:10.375
I'd fight my arguments
to the death.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.333
And more often than not,
it was me versus Antigone Kim.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.417
Literati must've seen something
in me and my passion

13:17.458 --> 13:19.333
because that year they tapped
me to join.

13:20.917 --> 13:23.750
Graveyard. Midnight.
Bring a dress.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.291
I mean, that's all the invite
said.

13:25.333 --> 13:28.500
Literati was the most
respected club on campus.

13:28.542 --> 13:31.041
They only invite a handful
of people to join each year.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.500
So... I mean, I was flattered.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.166
The cool kids wanted
to hang out with me,

13:36.208 --> 13:38.166
but the initiation process,
it proved to be too much.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.583
Too gothic, robes and masks.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.250
And then they asked us to
attack each other, verbally.

13:45.291 --> 13:48.208
And I always liked debating
with Antigone in class,

13:48.250 --> 13:50.375
but for fun?
I mean, that's just not me.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.041
My gut told me to walk away,
so, I quit.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.834
- And you regret it. Why?

13:59.375 --> 14:00.709
- Because in retrospect, I mean,

14:00.750 --> 14:02.333
it was a short-sighted decision.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.208
- "We are the sum
of our decisions,

14:05.250 --> 14:08.166
and as long as you're happy
that's all that matters."

14:08.208 --> 14:09.917
Antigone Morris.

14:09.959 --> 14:11.709
- (Scoffs)

14:11.750 --> 14:14.375
The thing is, I'm not happy.

14:17.083 --> 14:19.375
I mean, I could've just went
along with it and I should've.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.291
- And if you had joined?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.083
- Membership has its privileges.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.166
I mean, just look what
it did for Antigone.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.875
Uhn-uhn, if I could so it over?
I would...

14:28.917 --> 14:30.375
I would join literati

14:30.417 --> 14:32.250
and I would do their silly
little initiation,

14:32.291 --> 14:34.333
and I would get on
the right path.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.375
The path that I should have
been on all along.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.208
Student chant: "No more fees!"

14:43.250 --> 14:45.125
"No more fees! No more fees!"

14:52.917 --> 14:54.834
Claire: Say "no" to tuition
increases.

14:54.875 --> 14:57.250
Protestors: No! No! No!

14:57.291 --> 14:58.750
- Say "no" to tuition increases.

15:00.291 --> 15:02.250
Education is a right!

15:02.291 --> 15:04.834
We will fight and fight!
No! (protestors chant)

15:06.375 --> 15:08.250
Say "no" to tuition increases.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.250
Protestors: No! No! No!

15:10.291 --> 15:11.792
- Ethan!
- Erica?

15:13.417 --> 15:14.667
What are you doing up front
there?

15:14.709 --> 15:17.625
- I have no idea! Sorry.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.333
Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Fascists!

15:20.375 --> 15:22.125
Police officer: Move back!
Erica: Let go of me.

15:23.917 --> 15:26.709
Let go of me!
I said it was an accident!

15:26.750 --> 15:28.875
(chanting)
"No more fees! No more fees!
No more fees! No more fees!"

15:28.917 --> 15:30.667
- Come on, let's get out
of here.

15:30.709 --> 15:36.041
(chanting)
"No more fees! No more fees!
No more fees! No more fees!"

15:36.083 --> 15:39.291
- What, they think they scare
me? With their laws and rules?

15:39.333 --> 15:40.875
You know, you can arrest
the body,

15:40.917 --> 15:43.208
but the spirit you'll never
chain.

15:45.458 --> 15:47.083
I'm late for a women's studies.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.333
- Claire's incredible,
isn't she?

15:50.375 --> 15:52.583
- Yeah, that's one word
to describe her.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.375
- Underneath all that angst
and aggression and confidence,

15:54.417 --> 15:56.250
she's actually really insecure.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.125
Her parents are rich.
I mean, megabucks.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.208
She never tells anyone because
she thinks that if people knew,

16:00.250 --> 16:02.458
it would compromise her message.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.125
- Compromise her message?

16:04.166 --> 16:06.166
- I know, she over thinks
things, but in a cute way.

16:06.208 --> 16:07.583
Don't ever tell Claire
I told you,

16:07.625 --> 16:08.834
she'd totally kill me.
- I won't.

16:10.375 --> 16:12.291
Judith: Hey, guys, wait up!

16:12.333 --> 16:14.291
Erica: (surprised laughter)
Oh my God.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.041
Judith, look at you.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.583
- Look at me? Look at you.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.291
You're covered in dirt.

16:19.333 --> 16:22.208
God, you radicals really
gross me out.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.458
- Okay, this is worse than that
time right before senior prom,

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
when you got that
nasty spiral perm.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.458
- Oh, and you had to...

16:33.500 --> 16:35.375
straighten it with
your flat iron.

16:35.417 --> 16:37.500
You know, I totally
forgot about that.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.417
- Forgot? It was like
two years ago.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.875
- She's been like this all day.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.542
I think she got beaned
by a rock.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.458
- Ow!

16:44.500 --> 16:47.375
- Ah, sorry,
I thought it was grass.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.291
- Freaks.

16:52.041 --> 16:53.834
- Uh, yeah, don't do that.
- Class.

16:55.458 --> 16:56.917
Today we'll continue talking
about James Joyce's

16:58.458 --> 17:01.333
modernist masterpiece, Ulysses.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.875
Um... Erica,

17:04.458 --> 17:06.500
why don't you lead
the discussion.

17:06.542 --> 17:07.834
- Um, me, Professor Bristow?

17:09.333 --> 17:10.834
- Breslow.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.583
And yes, you.
Pick up where we left off.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.291
On the use of "yes, yes, yes"
at novel's end.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.291
- Okay, just give me one
second, it's been awhile.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.291
Since, since our,
our last class.

17:25.917 --> 17:27.375
- Should I answer,
Professor Breslow?

17:27.417 --> 17:29.166
- No that's fine. I got it.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.625
Thanks. Um...

17:31.667 --> 17:33.583
It was about Joyce's,
uh, determination

17:35.208 --> 17:36.917
to reinstate the male
dominated perspective

17:38.417 --> 17:40.125
in opposition to, um...

17:40.166 --> 17:42.333
- Perhaps what Erica is,
um, trying to say,

17:44.625 --> 17:46.542
is that the use
of phallo-centric language,

17:46.583 --> 17:48.625
like, "the scrotum tightening
sea",

17:48.667 --> 17:50.792
was, uh, in the parlance
of the times--

17:50.834 --> 17:52.166
- Thank you, bye the way,
for telling me

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
what I was trying to say.
- Cat fight.

17:54.667 --> 17:57.333
Breslow: Can get back
to the material, please?

17:57.375 --> 17:59.375
And put aside our petty
rivalries?

18:01.291 --> 18:02.709
(Student chatter and laughter)

18:02.750 --> 18:04.417
Male student: Erica strange?
- Yes?

18:06.375 --> 18:08.208
- You dropped this.
- Thank you.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.208
Ethan: Who was that?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.166
- No one. Hey, listen you guys,

18:14.208 --> 18:15.750
I'm gonna catch up with you
back at rez, okay?

18:15.792 --> 18:18.250

(Fearful cries,
pounding within caskets)

20:54.417 --> 20:56.667
Male student: Let me out please!
Please, let me out right now!

20:56.709 --> 20:59.041
Please! Please let me out!

20:59.083 --> 21:01.834
(Pounding within caskets,
panicked shouts and cries)

21:01.875 --> 21:03.959
Male student: I can't breathe!
Let me out, please!

21:04.000 --> 21:06.458
Let me outta here!
Let me outta here, please!

21:06.500 --> 21:08.709
(Frantic cries
and pounding within casket)

21:08.750 --> 21:10.750
Male student: I can't breathe!

21:10.792 --> 21:12.333
Erica: 'Kay, wait-wait-wait,
wait-wait-wait, he's...

21:12.375 --> 21:14.875
He's having a panic attack,
he's freaking out.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.291
- Everything will be fine.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.250
(Frantic pleas,
shouting and pounding)

21:21.583 --> 21:23.834
Masked student: Erica and
Antigone, pick up your shovels.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.208
Pick them up. Do what we say.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.250
Trust us. Have faith.

21:29.875 --> 21:31.542
(Students yell for help,
pounding within caskets)

21:33.041 --> 21:34.625
- Hey! Are you okay?!

21:34.667 --> 21:36.083
- Please let me out!

21:36.125 --> 21:37.417
Antigone: What are we doing?

21:37.458 --> 21:38.959
- Screw this.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.834
- I can't breath!
Let me outta here, please!

21:40.875 --> 21:42.875
Please!

21:42.917 --> 21:45.000
(Grunts) Oh, God.

21:45.041 --> 21:47.500
(Transylvanian accent)
I want to suck your blood.

21:47.542 --> 21:49.125
(Half laughs)

21:49.166 --> 21:50.834
(Laughing)

21:53.208 --> 21:55.542
(Breathing heavily)

21:57.709 --> 21:59.625
- You, you and you. Go!

22:02.000 --> 22:04.166
You have not passed our test.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.834
- What is this? (pants)

22:09.875 --> 22:11.500
That's not funny.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.291
- Welcome to literati.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.750
- I wish I had a polaroid.

22:16.792 --> 22:18.458
The looks on your faces
were priceless.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.792
"We don't want to bury
these dudes alive."

22:20.834 --> 22:22.792
Erica: Funny.
Male student: (Laughs)

22:24.792 --> 22:26.542
(Relaxed sigh)

22:29.375 --> 22:30.917
Hey, over there, isn't that...

22:30.959 --> 22:32.875
Our former Prime Minister? Yup.

22:34.125 --> 22:36.542
You know the vast majority of
people in your situation tonight

22:36.583 --> 22:38.500
just follow orders.

22:38.542 --> 22:40.792
But you two,
you think for yourselves.

22:40.834 --> 22:43.417
Your minds are free
from convention.

22:43.458 --> 22:45.959
"Veritas vos liberabit"

22:46.750 --> 22:48.834
- The truth will set you free.

22:48.875 --> 22:52.291
- And joining the literati
is not simply a social affair.

22:52.333 --> 22:55.291
Our most important work
is published in our zine;
The Punisher.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.000
- The "slam" paper?

22:57.041 --> 22:58.792
- It's not a "slam" paper,
or a gossip rag.

23:01.625 --> 23:04.333
Our next cover.
- Ah, yes.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.500
Let me guess, you're thinking,

23:06.542 --> 23:08.792
Claire does so much good
for us students.

23:09.875 --> 23:13.959
The thing is, 10 students got
arrested today because of her.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.792
They all now have criminal
records.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.542
- I don't trust her.
I never have.

23:19.583 --> 23:21.834
- Erica. You're friends
with Claire.

23:21.875 --> 23:23.917
- Not exactly. I'm-

23:23.959 --> 23:26.417
- Dig. Get to the truth.

23:26.458 --> 23:29.500
Pull your weight
and earn your place.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.500
Fail, and your membership
will be revoked.

23:35.417 --> 23:37.208
(Low hum of traffic,
streetcar dings)

23:39.500 --> 23:40.959
(Car horn beeps)

23:45.500 --> 23:47.417
Friend: Leo, don't be long.
Andre's meeting us at 10.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.000
- Leo.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.417
- Mom hasn't heard from you
in, like, 48 hours, so...

23:59.458 --> 24:01.083
she sent me here to make sure--

24:01.125 --> 24:02.291
Oh, that I wasn't abducted
by aliens?

24:03.834 --> 24:05.166
- (Half laughs) Yeah.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.542
(Half laughs)

24:08.000 --> 24:09.834
- Hey, why don't you come in?
I'll make you breakfast.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.792
- You'll make me cereal?

24:11.834 --> 24:13.917
Uh, look, i got plans
With the guys, but...

24:15.625 --> 24:18.208
Here.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.583
I made it for your next rave
or protest or... whatever.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.917
- Oh, wow, I love it.
Thank you.

24:26.583 --> 24:27.917
Hey, what happened?

24:27.959 --> 24:29.709
- Yeah, uh...

24:29.750 --> 24:31.458
Darryl and I snuck up
onto the long cement thing

24:31.500 --> 24:33.208
outside the front of city hall.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.959
It looked like a good place
to board.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.417
- Leo, you gotta take
better care of yourself.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.959
- (Exhales) Okay, mom!
- Seriously.

24:41.041 --> 24:43.125
Why don't you lecture me
about eating my vegetables

24:43.166 --> 24:46.000
and not dropping out
of university.

24:46.041 --> 24:48.000
Wear that in peace.

24:50.583 --> 24:51.917
- Hey, Leo.

24:53.417 --> 24:56.000
Thanks. For this.

24:56.041 --> 24:57.792
You don't know how much
this means.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.375
(Wrappers rustle)

25:14.041 --> 25:15.917
- Excuse me, you don't - you
don't happen to make lattes?

25:17.458 --> 25:18.834
Dr. Tom.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.875
You're in a hairnet.

25:21.917 --> 25:23.959
- Keeps the crude
out of the crudites.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.750
Ah, no. No lattes.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.417
But I do have carrot sticks.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.417
So... What up?

25:30.458 --> 25:32.041
- What up.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.208
Okay, let's see.
Since I've been back

25:34.250 --> 25:36.041
I've buried someone alive.

25:36.083 --> 25:38.709
Literati, kinda dramatic.
- Kind of?

25:38.750 --> 25:40.667
- And the head honcho,
Barrett Ironside?

25:40.709 --> 25:42.125
(whispers)
He's a total head case.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.000
- A head case who is now
a powerful Hollywood producer,

25:44.041 --> 25:45.834
thanks to his literati
connections -

25:45.875 --> 25:47.709
and his flair for the dramatic.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.291
- He wants me to destroy Claire.

25:49.333 --> 25:51.875
- Ah, "those who plot
the destruction of others

25:51.917 --> 25:54.375
often perish in the attempt."
Thomas Moore.

25:55.709 --> 25:57.834
- Okay, and what about those
who pulverize

25:57.875 --> 26:00.625
their husband's hearts
into tiny shards of glass?

26:00.667 --> 26:02.250
- Hard to say.

26:02.291 --> 26:05.083
- Claire le Duc, she is a liar
and a cheater.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.750
And it is your job - your
mission - to mete out justice.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.917
- No, I- well, I wouldn't
say that exactly,

26:09.959 --> 26:11.750
But if Antigone,
if she knew what I knew--

26:13.417 --> 26:14.875
- She'd have thrown Claire
to the lions, of course.

26:14.917 --> 26:16.792
It's that killing spirit
which has made Antigone

26:16.834 --> 26:18.709
Such a success in life.

26:18.750 --> 26:20.750
- Exactly, killing spirit.

26:20.792 --> 26:22.667
That doesn't sound like me.

26:22.709 --> 26:24.667
And that's the reason why
I walked away from literati

26:24.709 --> 26:27.083
in the first place.
But Claire, she's...

26:27.125 --> 26:28.917
She is a spoiled little brat

26:28.959 --> 26:30.291
that has pulled the wool
over everyone's eyes

26:30.333 --> 26:32.959
including Ethan.
She deserves to go down.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.750
- You're sounding nothing
like yourself already.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.208
- If I want to achieve anything,

26:36.250 --> 26:37.792
I gotta be a little bit
less like me,

26:37.834 --> 26:39.750
and a little more like them.

26:39.792 --> 26:42.041
- The egg.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.959
Perfection, both in function
and in form.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.166
It has a double arch,
top and bottom,

26:47.208 --> 26:49.208
it's what makes an egg
so incredibly strong.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.125
But the minute that we begin
to chip away at its integrity,

26:53.667 --> 26:56.041
the egg collapses in on itself.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.542
Until in the end we're left
with only...

26:58.583 --> 27:00.083
Breakfast.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.792
It's still an egg,
but it's not the same.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.458
(Din of chatter)

27:16.125 --> 27:17.875
Claire: (Laughing)

27:19.917 --> 27:21.500
(Indiscernible chatter,
laughter)

27:23.000 --> 27:24.542
- (Clears throat)

27:24.583 --> 27:26.625
- Oh, Erica. Erica.

27:26.667 --> 27:28.875
I was so inspired
by our last protest,

27:28.917 --> 27:31.083
that I've decided to get
everyone to chain themselves

27:31.125 --> 27:33.625
to the front doors of the
registrar's office tomorrow.

27:33.667 --> 27:35.041
Me, and hundreds of students.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.834
Like, that's true solidarity.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.792
Good morning to you too, Claire.

27:39.834 --> 27:41.667
- (Sighs) Erica, always so
hung up on propriety.

27:44.041 --> 27:46.333
Your conventional ways
will hold you back.

27:46.375 --> 27:49.000
- Wow, you-you really.. you
don't have a filter, do you?

27:49.041 --> 27:51.667
- Well... What good
is filtering the truth?

27:51.709 --> 27:53.166
I just say it like it is.

27:53.208 --> 27:56.041
I am myself, Claire, always.

27:56.083 --> 27:57.917
Oh, really? And what...what was
that down there with the guy,

27:59.458 --> 28:01.125
and the posters? Hmm?

28:01.166 --> 28:02.917
- Oh my god, Erica,
you Anglos are so repressed.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.417
Flirting is not cheating.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.125
What, you think Ethan
never looks around?

28:10.166 --> 28:12.667
- I think that Ethan
loves you very much

28:12.709 --> 28:14.709
and would put up with
a lot from you.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.250
I think you're very lucky
to have someone like him.

28:17.291 --> 28:20.000
- Yeah, well, Ethan knows me.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.208
He knows where I stand and
I would never cheat on him.

28:24.041 --> 28:25.959
Okay, so, let me get this
straight,

28:26.000 --> 28:27.875
you're a girl from
the wrong side of the tracks,

28:27.917 --> 28:29.208
who's fighting against
tuition hikes,

28:29.250 --> 28:31.291
who always tells the truth,

28:31.333 --> 28:33.417
and would never, ever cheat

28:33.458 --> 28:36.208
and break my best friend's
heart. That's you?

28:36.250 --> 28:37.875
- That's right.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.875
Take it or leave it.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.583
Antigone: Look, I am tell you,
this professor is notorious

28:46.625 --> 28:48.125
for breaking her students.

28:48.166 --> 28:49.875
Okay, cast members
from her last production

28:49.917 --> 28:51.792
said she practiced
psychological warfare

28:51.834 --> 28:54.875
because "that's the way it
works in the theater world."

28:54.917 --> 28:56.750
- Tough prof, so what?

28:56.792 --> 29:00.083
- This prof, who claims to have
been a professional actress

29:00.125 --> 29:02.583
was really just a stage
manager. Total liar.

29:04.959 --> 29:06.834
Barrett: That has potential.

29:08.291 --> 29:10.250
Good work.

29:10.291 --> 29:12.583
Strange, you got some
competition here. So?

29:14.875 --> 29:16.583
What do you got?

29:19.959 --> 29:21.750
- Um, actually, I, um...
I don't have anything.

29:23.625 --> 29:26.875
- Hm, big surprise.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.792
Okay. What if I told you
that Claire le Duc,

29:30.333 --> 29:32.041
the working class Joan of arc,

29:33.834 --> 29:36.000
is actually Claire St. Armand,

29:36.041 --> 29:38.291
the daughter of one of
Montreal's richest businessmen?

29:41.917 --> 29:43.333
- Nice.

Judith:
"La Duchess's cries of poverty
are actually a cry for help.

30:19.208 --> 30:21.125
Claire, it seems,
is so privileged,

30:21.166 --> 30:23.542
She can even afford
multiple personalities."

30:23.583 --> 30:26.083
Damn, is this true?
Her being loaded?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.375
- I, I guess so.
What else did they say?

30:28.417 --> 30:29.917
- I don't know, it's brutal.

30:29.959 --> 30:32.667
I mean, whoever wrote this is...
I don't know?

30:32.709 --> 30:34.625
Kind a psychotic.

30:34.667 --> 30:38.166
Well, would you look at that,
I'm late for class,

30:38.208 --> 30:40.375
on the other side of campus.

30:40.417 --> 30:42.166
- (tight lipped)
Judith, do not abandon me.
- Gotta go.

30:44.375 --> 30:46.208
- Hi. Hey, Claire.
- You see the paper?

30:47.750 --> 30:49.333
- Uh, yeah, I did.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.917
- I was trying to help
the students, you know?

30:51.959 --> 30:54.125
I was trying to do
something good.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.125
I wanted it to be about
what if said and what I did,

30:56.166 --> 30:58.959
not about my parents and their
money, their influence.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.458
They have nothing to do
with this.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.375
- Hey. Wanna eat a piece
of my cake?

31:03.417 --> 31:05.417
- Look, just ignore him, clear--
that guy's an idiot!

31:07.041 --> 31:09.291

Um, I was coming to find you.
I wanna talk.

31:27.333 --> 31:29.166
- Let's do this inside.

31:30.583 --> 31:32.000
- Okay.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.375
- Ethan--
- You know, if you did what I
think you did to Claire...

31:40.417 --> 31:43.083
I can't believe it,
you went after my girlfriend.

31:43.125 --> 31:46.333
- She lied to everyone.
- You do not get to judge her.

31:46.375 --> 31:48.583
- How do you know that
she's not lying to you?

31:48.625 --> 31:50.166
- I'm not talking about this.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.667
You know, you don't even know
the whole story.

31:51.709 --> 31:54.166
Her parents hate what she's
doing, what she's becoming.

31:54.208 --> 31:56.291
They've practically
disowned her.

31:56.333 --> 31:58.625
- Yeah, I-I didn't know that.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.458
- The Punisher asked you to dig
up dirt for their own reasons.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.125
What were yours?

32:04.166 --> 32:05.583
She did it out of insecurity

32:05.625 --> 32:08.500
and worry people would
judge her.

32:08.542 --> 32:11.250
But you, Erica?

32:11.291 --> 32:14.375
I don't think I know you.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.208
- Ethan.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.000
Ethan.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.917
(Ball rattles along floor)

32:34.500 --> 32:36.500
(Light whack of mallet)

32:36.542 --> 32:39.333
Uh, interference, meaning I get
to hit again.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.333
Thank you, Erica,
always coming through.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.083
- (Polite laugh)

32:44.125 --> 32:46.208
- I take it you saw our little
newspaper?

32:46.250 --> 32:48.041
- I saw Claire.
Not a happy anarchist.

32:50.125 --> 32:51.750
- You guys, you really went
to town.

32:51.792 --> 32:53.375
- Well, went as far
as the truth permitted.

32:53.417 --> 32:57.208
- Throw in a little flair and
every last issue was snapped up.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.250
Look, I made a mistake.

33:00.291 --> 33:02.500
I had no right to tell you
about Claire.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.500
- All you did was tell
the truth.

33:04.542 --> 33:06.959
I am this close to giving you
our next issue.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.458
(Breath of disbelief)

33:08.500 --> 33:10.333
- I don't want it.
- Erica.

33:12.166 --> 33:14.125
Look, getting to the truth
is one thing,

33:14.166 --> 33:16.000
but you guys, you,
you relish the humiliation.

33:17.750 --> 33:20.208
degrading someone
is fun for you.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.875
But that is not who I am.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.458
So, I quit.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.000
- You understand what
you're giving up?

33:27.041 --> 33:28.583
You quit and that's it.

33:28.625 --> 33:31.542
- Believe me, I understand.

33:31.583 --> 33:33.417
But the price of admission
is way too high.

33:42.333 --> 33:44.125
Claire: So, the point is we
want to block the entrance.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.542
So let's handcuff ourselves
to each other and
to the door handle.

33:49.250 --> 33:51.166
- Hey, Claire.

33:51.208 --> 33:52.583
- Here to dig up more dirt
on me?

33:52.625 --> 33:54.333
- I'm sorry.

33:54.375 --> 33:56.333
- No, but don't apologize
to me,

33:56.375 --> 33:57.750
apologize to the hundreds
of students

33:57.792 --> 34:00.250
that wont be able
to afford tuition.

34:00.291 --> 34:02.500
- Okay. Yeah, no, fine,
I will, I'll do it.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.166
I'll do whatever it takes.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.041
What I did was wrong
and I really regret it.

34:11.959 --> 34:14.000
Sit, sit!

34:16.291 --> 34:17.667
(Chanting)
Education is a right!

34:17.709 --> 34:19.333
We will fight, fight, fight!

34:19.375 --> 34:21.250
Education is a right!

34:21.291 --> 34:23.083
We will fight, fight, fight!

34:23.125 --> 34:25.083
Education is a right!

34:25.125 --> 34:27.250
We will fight, fight, fight!

34:27.291 --> 34:28.875
(Binder rattles) Ow!

34:30.583 --> 34:33.291
- Erica?

34:33.333 --> 34:36.750
So, I guess you made it
through your first morning.

34:36.792 --> 34:38.250
Before you know it,
you're gonna be my rock.

34:38.291 --> 34:39.625
Like, like, Jean.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.208
- Um... who's Jean?

34:42.709 --> 34:44.458
Oh, uh, over there.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.333
Jean, you've been
with me since...

34:46.375 --> 34:47.959
What? Since we were nothing
but a little storage unit

34:48.000 --> 34:49.417
in Etobicoke.

34:49.458 --> 34:51.875
- (laughs) Welcome to the team.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.875
- Okey-dokey, well, I have got
to get to a conference call,

34:55.542 --> 34:57.250
you've got some photo copying
to do. Thanks a lot.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.000
And after that, let's go out
for a little celebratory lunch.

35:00.625 --> 35:02.125
And, and by lunch,
I do mean liquid.

35:04.208 --> 35:05.625
(Low hum of chatter,
phones ring)

35:15.417 --> 35:17.500
(Door shuts)

35:17.542 --> 35:19.333
- Can you, like, give me a
warning sign or something?

35:19.375 --> 35:21.208
- Please, have a seat.

35:21.250 --> 35:23.500
- Okay, but look.

35:23.542 --> 35:25.375
For the record, I get it.
- What?

35:26.959 --> 35:28.583
I ended up right back
where I started.

35:28.625 --> 35:31.417
I mean, literati,
it's clearly not for me.

35:31.458 --> 35:35.291
And... I just need to learn
to be happy with what I have.

35:35.542 --> 35:37.583
- As in, the cubicle?

35:37.625 --> 35:40.125
Are you happy at "White Dreams?"

35:40.166 --> 35:41.750
- No. But that's
different it's--

35:41.792 --> 35:44.667
- Our lives are like a house
of cards.

35:44.709 --> 35:47.792
You know, some of the cards
are... cosmetic.

35:47.834 --> 35:50.709
While others are load bearing
walls.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.417
You remove one of those cards

35:52.458 --> 35:54.458
and the whole thing
comes tumbling down.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.417
- Like the egg.
- Like the egg.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.333
Chip away at what
makes you "you"

35:59.375 --> 36:02.166
and you become something else.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.875
Your gut told you to avoid
Literati the first time around

36:04.917 --> 36:06.667
and you were right to listen
to that.

36:06.709 --> 36:08.834
There are many ways to achieve
our goals, Erica,

36:08.875 --> 36:11.166
But ignoring your inner voice...

36:11.208 --> 36:13.250
is not one of them.

36:13.291 --> 36:15.041
So... tell me.

36:16.750 --> 36:18.625
Is this job the right job
for you?

36:24.250 --> 36:25.667
- No.

36:27.625 --> 36:29.709
(Chair creaks)

36:36.375 --> 36:38.000
(Nervous breath)

36:43.458 --> 36:45.041
(Startled yelp)

36:46.542 --> 36:48.250
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

36:48.291 --> 36:49.875
No-no, that wasn't my shih tzu,

36:49.917 --> 36:52.625
that was me. Look, I, um...
I'll have to call you back.

36:54.041 --> 36:56.375
Erica, are you trying
to kill me.

36:56.417 --> 36:58.083
This face? Not as young
as it looks.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.125
- Um... Uncle Ruby, I quit.

37:03.250 --> 37:05.375
And I appreciate so much,
this opportunity,

37:05.417 --> 37:07.750
but it just, it isn't right.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.333
- You haven't even
given it a day.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.709
- That's just the thing,
I don't need to.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.291
I know that it's wrong, for me.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.834
The wedding biz,

37:15.875 --> 37:18.000
It's what you always
wanted to do, right?

37:18.041 --> 37:20.000
- I used to dress your mom up
in your Bubbie's lace curtains

37:20.041 --> 37:21.709
when I was six.

37:21.750 --> 37:24.542
- Exactly, you knew.
and I feel that...

37:24.583 --> 37:27.458
You know what? I know that
there is something out there

37:27.500 --> 37:29.250
that I'm supposed to do.

37:29.291 --> 37:31.792
and I wanna take the time,
right now, to find it,

37:31.834 --> 37:33.834
you know, maybe it's books?

37:33.875 --> 37:35.500
- Oh, you could read
on your lunch breaks?

37:37.000 --> 37:38.458
- Ah, well...

37:40.000 --> 37:41.709
- Oh, okay, okay, okay, fine.

37:43.208 --> 37:45.208
Come here. Come here.

37:45.250 --> 37:46.709
- Ohhh.

37:46.750 --> 37:48.500
- Now, go. Go, go-go-go-go-go.

37:48.542 --> 37:50.083
Do what you have to do.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.417
Your mom may not understand,
but I do.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.542
And I'll... I'll talk to her.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.792
Though, I can't promise,
she won't disembowel me.

37:58.834 --> 38:01.333
- Thank you, Uncle Ruby,
for everything.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.792
- Okay.

38:02.834 --> 38:04.166
(Elated breath)

38:05.625 --> 38:07.125
(Din of chatter)

38:16.333 --> 38:22.792
♪ ♪

38:22.834 --> 38:24.166
- Here it is.

38:25.583 --> 38:27.250
Oh...

38:27.291 --> 38:28.834
Huh.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.500
Well, you're right,
I mean, it is a little small,

38:36.542 --> 38:39.375
but the layout is...
is pretty good.

38:40.917 --> 38:42.709
And there's tons of storage.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.417
- Yeah, and the rent's cheapish.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.000
Of course, compared to Montreal.

38:46.041 --> 38:48.375
- Well, you can't compare
anything to Montreal rent.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.959
Bagels... Mmm.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.250
- And it's uh, right next door.
That's not gonna be weird?

38:53.291 --> 38:55.375
- No, I don't think so.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.041
- Doesn't feel like,
uh... we're regressing.

38:57.083 --> 38:58.750
Like we're living back
in residence?

38:58.792 --> 39:01.000
Hm. Yeah, just minus the,
uh, the co-ed showers.

39:01.041 --> 39:02.667
No, I think it will be fine.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.208
Besides, rez is where
we became best buds.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.375
- Totally.

39:09.375 --> 39:11.583
- And where we almost
fired me as a friend.

39:13.125 --> 39:14.875
- What are you talking about?

39:14.917 --> 39:16.834
- Remember... in second year...

39:18.417 --> 39:20.291
When I almost joined Literati?

39:20.333 --> 39:21.875
- Ah, and sold out Claire?

39:21.917 --> 39:23.875
- You remember?

39:23.917 --> 39:25.792
- Yeah, I remember that.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.417
- Do you ever wish...

39:31.458 --> 39:32.959
I mean, especially now,

39:33.000 --> 39:36.500
given everything that's
going on with you and Claire...

39:36.542 --> 39:37.917
- What?

39:40.083 --> 39:42.041
- Do you wish that you woulda
listened to me?

39:42.083 --> 39:43.917
And you know, saved yourself
a lot of heartache?

39:45.500 --> 39:47.875
- Uh...

39:47.917 --> 39:49.792
No.

39:49.834 --> 39:51.917
- Really?

39:51.959 --> 39:53.750
- I mean, she's destroyed
my life,

39:56.166 --> 39:58.250
but she was my life
for a long time, you know?

40:02.875 --> 40:05.208
So, I don't see any reason why
I shouldn't take this place.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.125
- (Gasps) great!

40:07.166 --> 40:09.417
Oh, we're gonna have
so much fun.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.709
Jenny and Judith, they're gonna
be really jealous.

40:11.750 --> 40:13.667
(Cell phone rings)
Oh, that's me.

40:16.834 --> 40:18.458
River Rock pub?

40:18.500 --> 40:20.375
(Phone ringing)

40:20.417 --> 40:21.917
(Small shocked gasp)
River Rock Publishing.

40:21.959 --> 40:23.875
Oh my God.
- Well, answer it!

40:23.917 --> 40:25.792
- Okay.

40:25.834 --> 40:27.792
Hello.

40:27.834 --> 40:29.542
This is she.

40:32.041 --> 40:33.709
Next week? Sure, of course
I can make it.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.041
Three o'clock.

40:38.083 --> 40:40.125
Mm-hmm, no, that's...

40:40.166 --> 40:42.625
Uh-huh. No, I know
where the offices are.

40:42.667 --> 40:45.750
Great. Okay, thank you.

40:45.792 --> 40:47.250
(Elated squeal)

40:47.291 --> 40:48.917
- That's great. Congratulations.

40:48.959 --> 40:51.000
- I've got an interview.

40:51.041 --> 40:52.875
You got an apartment.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.625
(Chanting)
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

40:56.250 --> 40:57.583
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

40:59.583 --> 41:02.000
Global justice now!
Global justice now!

41:02.041 --> 41:03.834
Erica: Everyone's got their
own path.

41:05.417 --> 41:07.000
Some are only just beginning.

41:14.375 --> 41:16.750
(Reflective sigh)

41:16.792 --> 41:18.709
While others end all too soon.

41:28.041 --> 41:30.125
However you do it, the fact is,

41:30.166 --> 41:32.083
the path you're on,
the choices you make,

41:32.125 --> 41:33.667
define who you are.

41:36.041 --> 41:37.542
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Okay.

41:37.583 --> 41:39.709
Erica: Choices, they're the
building blocks of our lives.

41:39.750 --> 41:42.166
They shape our past,
present and future

41:42.208 --> 41:44.542
and despite all the mistakes
I've made,

41:44.583 --> 41:46.375
every new day brings with it
new choices

41:48.000 --> 41:49.750
and a whole new world
of possibilities.

41:49.792 --> 41:51.458
- Wow...
