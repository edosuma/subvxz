WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:05.035
Why are we doing this, Peg?

00:05.240 --> 00:08.073
The last time we had a party,
it was a disaster.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.516
It was our wedding.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.236
I rest my case.

00:16.079 --> 00:18.833
Give me one good reason
why I should go through with this.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.118
I won't make you have sex
for the rest of the month.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.113
Deal.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.313
Just my luck. One month without sex,
and it's February.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.193
I'm tacking on two extra days, Peg.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.432
Hi.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.997
I brought shrimp balls.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.749
Well, I can see that,
but what's in the bowl?

00:52.840 --> 00:55.513
I always feel so welcome
when I come into this house.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.359
Gee, I must be doing
something wrong.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.708
Shrimp balls.

01:01.320 --> 01:04.756
Those will go great
with the ketchup I'm serving.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.633
Oh, I see someone's been watching
Martha Stewart.

01:14.040 --> 01:17.271
- Hi, hi, hi.
- Hey, buddy.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.394
Who's your date, Griff?

01:24.600 --> 01:25.828
This is...

01:26.400 --> 01:27.913
..."Nancy."

01:28.840 --> 01:31.354
Okay.
Who's up for some Passion?

01:31.560 --> 01:34.120
She takes her clothes off,
I'm out of here.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.551
It's a party game, you idiot.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.753
Yeah. It tests how much you know
about the person you love the most.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.720
Fair enough.
I'll take John Wayne for 20.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.074

02:27.840 --> 02:29.956
What are you doing?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.631
Bud, I have been climbing
these stairs for over an hour.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.308
I am not getting any higher.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.953
Kelly, this chick-boxing movie
could be your big break. Okay?

02:42.160 --> 02:43.832
- I know.
- You gotta stay in shape.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.838
- Look. Let's run some lines, all right?
- Yeah.

02:47.320 --> 02:48.469
You're crazy, kid.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.875
No one can beat Big Mama O'Grady.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.833
Yo, Nicky, I know I can take her.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.396
That mother of two is going down.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.475
She'll murder you.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.672
She's a jungle tigress
and you're just a pussy cat.

03:02.880 --> 03:06.111
Well, let me tell you something
about this cat.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.390
- She has claws.
- She has claws.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.633
Skank alert.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.234
That's Heather Talrico.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.749
She's always going after my parts.

03:16.960 --> 03:19.554
I wish she'd go after mine.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.956
Well, well.
If it isn't the little bimbo that couldn't.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.232
Well, well.
If it isn't the human ThighMaster.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.759
You know what, Bundy? I'd love to shut
that black hole you call a mouth.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.430
With what?
That planet you call an ass?

03:44.360 --> 03:46.510
Why even bother to show up
for this part, Kelly?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.233
You know I'm gonna get it.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.158
I always get everything you want.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.271
Your jobs, your boyfriends.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.993
I could even have him.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.475
Hey, you wanna be my brother?

03:59.760 --> 04:01.398
God, yes.

04:04.080 --> 04:06.594
Drop dead, sicko.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.069
Look, Heather.

04:08.280 --> 04:12.751
I am going to get this role
for two reasons.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.676
Number one,
I am better at actressing than you are.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.599
And number two, I can box.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.438
Really? You want a piece of me?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.794
There's an exclusive club.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.437
Okay. Just you and me in the ring.

04:32.640 --> 04:37.998
Fine. And the loser,
which will be Y-O-U...

04:39.200 --> 04:41.316
...won't try out for the part.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.511
You're on, frat-house toy.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.154
Be here Sunday, 4 sharp.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.429
Oh, wait. I can't.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.551
That's when I get my manicure
from Matteo.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.549
- Don't you just love him?
- Oh, I know. He's so great.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.393
Make it 3, then.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.991
I'm gonna give you a knuckle salad.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.837
Sandwich.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.439
No, thanks. I'm in training.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.438
Okay. Marcy's favorite song is...

05:14.640 --> 05:16.198
..."You Light Up My Life."

05:20.840 --> 05:23.991
You light up my life, Jefferson.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.796
Oh, look, love bug.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.798
We're about to go from First Kiss
to Eternal Bliss.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.953
I'm about to go from "up" to "chuck."

05:40.440 --> 05:42.476
Okay. Griff.

05:42.680 --> 05:47.913
What is Nancy's idea
of a perfect romantic evening?

05:48.120 --> 05:51.430
Of course, we just met,
so I'm just guessing here.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.031
But I'll say pepperoni pizza, a foot rub
and a pile of kung-fu movies.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.553
We're getting our butts kicked.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.194
We're still on First Date Drive.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.356
Okay, Jefferson.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.393
What was Marcy's childhood dream?

06:11.080 --> 06:14.152
My princess
wanted to be a princess.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.872
I bet Nancy's dream was to be
Mrs. Jimmy "JJ" Walker.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.832
Dy-no-mite!

06:28.440 --> 06:29.714
All right, Al.

06:29.920 --> 06:33.595
Now, use that beer sponge
you call a brain.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.837
Well, since "sucking the life out
of my husband and leaving him...

06:37.040 --> 06:40.316
...an empty husk"
is too long for the card...

06:40.520 --> 06:43.876
...I'll say a cowgirl.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.594
Try again.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.793
A cow?

06:54.920 --> 06:56.956
How many times have I told you?

06:57.160 --> 07:00.675
When I was a little girl,
I wanted to be a ballerina.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.189
Ballerina?

07:03.400 --> 07:07.188
Well, you sure are my nutcracker.

07:15.680 --> 07:20.356
Al, making fun of your soul mate's
childhood dream.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.994
Go back two spaces.

07:23.720 --> 07:24.675
Nice going, Al.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.269
Now we're not even on the board.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.871
All right, buddy.
Let's try an easy one.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.271
When is Peg's birthday?

07:37.040 --> 07:40.999
I know this one because it's a month
that has a vowel in it.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.633
- How long have they been married?
- Hey, one question at a time here.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.115
I'd say M--

07:50.200 --> 07:52.156
March 12th.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.475
April 12th.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.752
Hey, hey, now.
For a shot in the dark, that was close.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.916
That's what you say in the bedroom
at night. It doesn't work there either.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.835
I can't believe you, Al.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.112
How is it that you know the ninth play
of your championship game--?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.390
Forty-two Blast on two.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.074
And yet you don't know
my favorite movie...

08:15.280 --> 08:17.999
...my birthday,
or the color of my eyes.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.078
Well, we should have got
partial credit for bloodshot.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.749
All right, guys.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.837
Guys, we're gonna give you
another chance.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.349
All right. Al.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.996
Where did you and Peggy...

08:35.240 --> 08:36.991
...first make love?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.038
Yes!

08:39.240 --> 08:41.515
We're back on the board, Peg.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.029
How could anybody forget that night?

08:44.240 --> 08:45.958
It was so hot.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.151
We were out of control, huh, babe?

08:48.360 --> 08:53.150
I'll never forget that Ping-Pong table
in your uncle's rumpus room.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.590
My uncle does not have
a Ping-Pong table.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.430
Does he have a rumpus room?

09:08.520 --> 09:12.115
I think Al's remembering
the wrong rumpus.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.869
It was on a crate
behind the Tastee Freez.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.913
And it was beautiful.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.269
Anyone wanna play Twister?

09:27.080 --> 09:30.390
I can't believe that you'd forget
the most romantic night of our lives.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.158
Well, I remember, sweetheart.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.794
And then we shared a Mr. Softy.

09:35.000 --> 09:35.955
Oh, yeah.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.311
And we've been sharing one
ever since.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.835
What, Peg?

10:01.680 --> 10:03.318
Good.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.476
Come on. Come on.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.513
Good.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.793
Body blow. Body blow.
Go ahead. Come on. Go ahead.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.071
Come on, now. Come on.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.032
Come on, Bundy. That's all you got?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.832
You hit like a girl.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.600
Yeah, well, you pee like one.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.910
That was a temporary
medical condition.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.473
- Come on.
- Hey.

10:52.200 --> 10:56.034
Hey. Hey, pumpkin, don't box.
You can get brain damage.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.038
Oh, yeah, right.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.111
Let me teach you the famous
Bundy combo.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.039
Now, you stomp
on your opponent's foot.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.593
You hit him with an uppercut.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.711
You mean like this?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.478
Thattagirl.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.477
But next time, put your weight into it.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.875
- Okay. Weight into it.
- Bud, quit playing around.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.958
- Okay, I think I got it. I think I got it.
- She hurt my nose.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.993
Bingo! Thattagirl!

11:21.200 --> 11:22.838
Well, that was fun, Daddy.
Thank you.

11:23.040 --> 11:25.554
- What's in the box?
- Oh, it's a present for your mom.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.829
We had a big fight.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.155
I'm in the doghouse.

11:28.760 --> 11:31.877
Oh, Daddy, that's terrible.
Where did Lucky sleep?

11:33.520 --> 11:36.114
Look, Sugar Ray Tard.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.193
It's a figure of speech.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.868
No, I actually was in the doghouse.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.514
These Snausages are good too.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.919
See, and look, no tartar.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.555
Peg.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.034
Peg.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.157
Peg, I got you something.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.511
- Oh, Al.
- I hope you like it.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.195
See, it matches the couch.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.635
You actually thought
that this would fit me?

12:13.840 --> 12:16.035
Yes. No.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.710
Well, maybe.
Whatever the right answer is.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.275
Come on, Peg.
A guy doesn't know things like this.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.870
Jefferson knows Marcy's dress size.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.640
That's because Jefferson
wears them.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.914
Al, you stink.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.829
Peg, I can't help that.
It's because of the Snausages.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.554
What else can I do? I know.
I'll take you to the movies.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.512
<i>The Great Escape's
playing at the Bijou.</i>

12:39.720 --> 12:40.789
No, thank you.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.115
I'd rather be alone.

12:46.960 --> 12:49.030
Gee, for 25 years,
I've dreamed of this moment.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.798
How come I'm not happy?

12:51.880 --> 12:55.031
Just like her to ruin this for me too.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.679
Doesn't Al understand?

12:58.880 --> 13:01.030
I just wanna spend more time
with him.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.312
Doesn't Peg understand
I just wanna be left alone?

13:05.720 --> 13:08.871
You know, and he's been
less attentive in bed.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.674
Is that possible?

13:11.880 --> 13:13.518
Oh, Marcy, what should I do?

13:13.720 --> 13:15.392
Leave him.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.633
I'm sorry,
I was thinking about what I would do.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.755
Or any sane woman.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.235
Listen, have you thought about
seeing someone?

13:24.440 --> 13:28.194
Well, I have had my eye
on the UPS guy.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.470
No. I mean you and Al
should see a marriage counselor.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.309
Yeah, but then wouldn't I have
to tell him about the UPS guy?

13:37.520 --> 13:40.751
Trust me.
Going to counseling will open Al up.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.476
Trust me.
Going to counseling will shut Peg up.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.910
Come on, Jefferson. Let's go home
and leave these two alone to talk...

13:50.120 --> 13:53.157
...or grunt,
whichever the case may be.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.919
Thank God
we have a normal marriage, huh?

13:58.120 --> 14:01.317
Let's go home and play
Fullback and the Tramp.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.519
I'll meet you
behind the Tastee Freez.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.793
Sorry.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.994
Where do they come up
with this sick stuff?

14:12.200 --> 14:15.033
Al, we need to talk.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.952
Honey, I wanna go
to a marriage counselor.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.037
So go.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.071
Al.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.998
Why won't you go to therapy?

14:26.200 --> 14:29.715
Maybe it's you who don't know me.
Because if you knew me, Peg...

14:29.920 --> 14:32.798
...you'd know that there are
certain things I do not do.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.560
I do not floss.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.793
I do not eat vegetables.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.629
I do not like French pastry.
I do not like the French.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.832
I do not cry at movies.

14:46.040 --> 14:50.955
<i>Except, of course, Old Yeller,
because we know it was very sad.</i>

14:51.160 --> 14:53.355
But most importantly, Peg...

14:53.560 --> 14:57.917
...I will never, ever,
under any circumstances...

14:58.120 --> 14:59.712
...go to a head shrinker.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.275
- But, Al--
- You go, Peg.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.598
There is no threat vicious enough,
no torture terrible enough...

15:06.800 --> 15:09.189
...to ever make me change my mind.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.635
Hello, Mom?

15:17.840 --> 15:19.717
Al's being mean to me again.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.876
Could you come stay
for a few months?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.115
No, Peg.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.673
Peg, no, Peg.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.155
Peg, no, Peg.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.749
I'll go. I'll go.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.710
Okay. She's all yours, Kelly.

15:33.920 --> 15:37.629
And hopefully, after you beat
her brains to mush, she's all mine.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.958
Float like a horsefly,
sting like a flea.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.470
No one can touch me, I'm Kelly.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.073
That movie role is mine.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.430
You're going down, street meat.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.150
Let's rock.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.516
- I hate you. Oh, hey.
- Watch it, Kel.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.398
Kelly, duck!

16:06.400 --> 16:08.595
Hey. Nobody hits my brother.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.756
At least, not without dating him first.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.837
You know,
you fight as bad as you act.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.112
Yeah, well, you fight as bad
as Brooke Shields acts.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.190
That's it, Bundy. I'm taking you out.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.550
No, thanks. I already have plans.
Come on.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.189
Come on. Come on.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.279
One, two.

16:46.480 --> 16:49.517
<i>The winner and star
of Catfight: The Movie...</i>

16:49.720 --> 16:53.429
...the Blond Bomber, Kelly Bundy.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.157
- I'm gonna be a movie star.
- Yes.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.999
I can't wait to see my face
on the big screen.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.078
I can tell right away
this counselor's an idiot, Peg.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.674
Why couldn't we have gone
to that guy I saw on TV?

17:15.880 --> 17:19.759
Al, I am not going to a drive-through
marriage counselor.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.678
Dr. Back-in-the-Sack
looked quite nurturing, Peg.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.678
And they wash your car
after every session.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.396
Hi. You must be the Bundys.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.953
I'm Dr. Longo.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.550
Please, won't you sit down?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.478
So how are you today?

17:37.040 --> 17:40.749
Those trick questions
won't work on me, doc.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.235
You can probe around in my head
all you want.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.351
You ain't gonna find anything
in there.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.957
I believe you.

17:49.640 --> 17:54.998
But the whole point of therapy
is to discuss our problems.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.077
Oh, no, we're not gonna talk
about me.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.590
Well, I'm not the one with a problem.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.600
Okay. Well, then...

18:02.800 --> 18:05.314
...we could talk about my problems.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.752
But I don't think a discussion
of my vinyl fetish will help any of us.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.349
Although I might enjoy it.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.437
Okay. I'll talk.

18:14.640 --> 18:19.475
You know, I'm not one to cast blame,
but this really is all Al's fault.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.319
He just doesn't pay any attention
to me anymore.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.875
Isn't that true, Al?

18:26.120 --> 18:27.997
Al?

18:28.680 --> 18:31.672
Mr. Bundy, I sense a reluctance
to communicate here.

18:31.880 --> 18:36.112
Well, that's gonna make your job just
a little bit tougher, isn't it, vinyl boy?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.032
Go ahead.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.037
Make me talk.

18:42.360 --> 18:47.957
Well, we have heard Mrs. Bundy
complain that you don't pay attention.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.072
So, Mr. Bundy-- Mr. Bundy?

18:54.440 --> 18:56.431
Can I have my balls back?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.479
Welcome to my world, doc.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.273
So other than the obvious...

19:10.480 --> 19:13.313
...what would be your main complaint
about your wife?

19:13.520 --> 19:17.399
I don't have any complaints about Peg.
Well, maybe just one tiny, little thing.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.795
Oh, great.
Now we're gonna hear about how...

19:20.000 --> 19:23.151
...if he hadn't gotten married, he would
have been a pro football player.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.635
Well, that's true.
I should be retired right now...

19:25.840 --> 19:29.116
...selling my autograph on QVC
and addicted to the finest painkillers...

19:29.320 --> 19:30.912
...money can buy.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.992
I gave up a lot too, you know.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.158
I know, down at the docks.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.438
I am referring to the fact
that I could have been married...

19:42.640 --> 19:45.916
...to Vito Leonetti
and been a successful Mafia wife.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.599
I don't think so, Peg.

19:47.800 --> 19:52.351
Mafia wives have to cook. You think
the heads of the Five Families...

19:52.560 --> 19:55.313
...are gonna be sitting around
tasting your tuna surprise?

19:55.520 --> 19:58.239
They don't like surprises, Peg.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.159
You know, I'm wearing a vinyl surprise
right now...

20:03.920 --> 20:05.672
...and it feels great.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.869
You happy now, Peg?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.877
We just wasted 15 bucks.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.878
That's half a day's wage
to listen to this nut job...

20:18.080 --> 20:20.719
...talk about his plastic pants.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.672
Excuse me. They're vinyl.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.555
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.797
Another good choice, Peg. I don't know
why I even put up with you.

20:29.200 --> 20:33.512
Well, if I'm so difficult to put up with,
why don't you just leave?

20:34.120 --> 20:35.314
Well, maybe I will.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.158
So go.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.952
Walk out that door.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.278
Turn around now,
you're not welcome anymore.

20:44.680 --> 20:48.468
I will survive.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.398
This is great.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.114
It sure is. I'm moving out, Peg.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.198
And much like that empty promise
to shave those shoulders...

20:56.400 --> 20:58.960
...I'll believe it when I see it.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.948
You'll be wishing you had
these shaggy shoulders to cry on, Peg.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.393
Same time next week?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.477
We just broke up.
