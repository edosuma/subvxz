00:00.047 --> 00:01.054
<i>Previously on "Bitten"...</i>

00:01.094 --> 00:03.585
Did you really think that giving me the
key to your hotel room would work?

00:03.625 --> 00:04.893
Whoa, just like that?

00:06.359 --> 00:07.559
There's usually only one reason

00:07.593 --> 00:09.461
women know that kind of self-defence.

00:09.495 --> 00:11.830
Sometimes, it's to prevent
anything bad from happening.

00:11.865 --> 00:15.034
Other times, it's to prevent those
things from happening again.

00:15.068 --> 00:16.401
I'll be honest with you, Victor:

00:16.435 --> 00:18.303
I hate the thought of letting you out.

00:18.337 --> 00:20.578
- I'm done with kids.
- Well, I really don't care about that.

00:20.606 --> 00:22.774
What I do care about is payback.

00:22.808 --> 00:26.244
- Which one?
- Elena Michaels.

00:26.279 --> 00:28.946
- Zachary Cain.
- Victor Olson.

00:28.981 --> 00:30.782
I was promised a fair trade.

00:30.816 --> 00:32.450
Information for Pack status.

00:32.485 --> 00:34.286
Marsten and Cain are building an army.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.655
They've turned two
psychopathic serial killers

00:36.689 --> 00:38.190
to counter the one that you have.

00:38.224 --> 00:41.025
Everything they're doing
is because of you, Clay.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.061
I had to drag a dead body

00:43.095 --> 00:44.762
across the property today.

00:44.797 --> 00:47.165
To protect you and the Pack.

00:47.199 --> 00:48.365
I'm going home.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.834
I have to go to a wedding,

00:49.868 --> 00:53.104
for the sister of the man
that I love and trust.

00:53.138 --> 00:55.039
I don't want this one
to break your heart.

00:55.074 --> 00:56.840
I can tell that you're all in.

00:56.874 --> 00:59.076
Obviously, she's not.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.978
I came because you called.

01:02.013 --> 01:03.780
I can't say no when you call.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.749
So I'm asking you not to.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.736 --> 01:26.903
You do realize we've not left the house

01:26.938 --> 01:28.904
in over two days?

01:28.939 --> 01:30.106
Sounds like a complaint.

01:30.140 --> 01:32.808
No, no, no, not in the least.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.711
Although I will have
you explain to Becky

01:34.745 --> 01:37.079
why we show up to her
wedding empty-handed.

01:37.114 --> 01:39.382
I promise you I will get
your sister's gift tomorrow.

01:39.416 --> 01:42.352
That wasn't meant as a guilt trip.

01:42.386 --> 01:46.188
You've got enough going
on with your family.

01:46.223 --> 01:47.623
Yeah.

01:59.002 --> 02:00.970
Oh, I'm starving.

02:03.673 --> 02:06.241
You ate the last dumpling?

02:06.276 --> 02:09.210
Here. Order some more.

02:09.245 --> 02:11.713
- They have our address on file.
- "Our"?

02:11.748 --> 02:15.116
Yeah, you have not been to your
apartment since you've been back.

02:15.151 --> 02:18.552
You've moved in here by stealth, right?

02:18.587 --> 02:20.588
I wouldn't do that to you.

02:20.622 --> 02:22.323
I don't cook and I don't clean, so...

02:22.357 --> 02:24.025
They have this new thing,

02:24.059 --> 02:26.995
it's, uh, cleaning service.

02:27.029 --> 02:29.697
Well, that's kind of hot.

02:29.731 --> 02:33.034
- Cleaning service gets you hot?
- Yeah.

02:33.068 --> 02:34.335
I'm kinky like that.

02:42.243 --> 02:44.679
Yes. Right, then.

02:44.713 --> 02:46.013
I'll see you when you get here.

02:46.047 --> 02:48.416
- Elena?
- Antonio.

02:48.450 --> 02:51.451
I sent him to reach out to the
other North American families.

02:51.485 --> 02:53.386
And without revealing
too much about our situation,

02:53.421 --> 02:56.389
he found out that we are the
only ones targeted by the Mutts.

02:56.424 --> 02:59.293
We all live by the rules you set.

02:59.327 --> 03:00.861
No offense to the other families,

03:00.895 --> 03:02.329
but if someone is going to strike,

03:02.363 --> 03:03.630
they'd strike at the head.

03:03.664 --> 03:05.199
Still, it's good to know

03:05.233 --> 03:08.335
that we can count on some
extra muscle if we need it.

03:08.369 --> 03:12.004
I sent Nick down to D.C. to have a
conversation with Joey and Dennis Stillwell.

03:12.039 --> 03:14.774
You think for a second if the
Stillwells find out we're under attack,

03:14.809 --> 03:16.909
they won't join the Mutts?
They're traitors.

03:16.944 --> 03:19.212
The Stillwells are hardly traitors.

03:19.246 --> 03:21.047
When the Pack separated,
they went their own way

03:21.081 --> 03:23.750
and they would prefer not to
be involved in our business.

03:23.784 --> 03:25.517
Isn't defending you
part of their business?

03:25.552 --> 03:27.320
If I called, they would come.

03:27.354 --> 03:30.589
I've had no occasion to call.

03:30.623 --> 03:32.058
Nick will make it clear to them

03:32.092 --> 03:34.293
that all of our allies
need to stay in line.

03:34.328 --> 03:35.862
And if that doesn't work?

03:35.896 --> 03:37.663
You'll expect me to get them in line?

03:37.697 --> 03:40.999
You going to tell me what's
really bothering you, Clay?

03:41.033 --> 03:44.436
What if she doesn't come home?

03:44.471 --> 03:46.505
Elena needs time to adjust.

03:46.539 --> 03:48.607
It was very intense here.

03:48.641 --> 03:50.843
We just need to give her some space.

03:50.877 --> 03:53.645
And if she doesn't want to adjust?

03:53.680 --> 03:57.749
What happens if "space" means she
turns her back on us for good?

03:57.783 --> 03:59.251
Then we will deal with it.

03:59.285 --> 04:02.120
You mean you'll expect
me to deal with it.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.122
If she goes rogue, she's a Mutt,

04:04.156 --> 04:07.025
and like all Mutts, she won't be
allowed to settle in one spot.

04:07.059 --> 04:09.761
It'll be my job to make her life
miserable until she moves on.

04:09.795 --> 04:12.864
To make sure she can never have a home.

04:12.899 --> 04:16.166
I won't be able to do that.

04:16.201 --> 04:18.569
You won't have to.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.971
She already came back once.

04:21.005 --> 04:22.673
She didn't like what she found.

04:26.712 --> 04:29.280
- Someone's here.
- I'll deal with it.

04:40.525 --> 04:42.960
Jeremy Danvers in the flesh.

04:42.994 --> 04:44.962
- Have we met?
- Samuel Boggs.

04:49.967 --> 04:51.367
Nice place.

04:51.402 --> 04:53.136
How can I help you, Mr. Boggs?

04:53.170 --> 04:55.705
Well, I came to meet the infamous Alpha.

04:55.740 --> 04:57.707
I figured you'd have
security in every corner.

04:57.742 --> 04:59.443
But here you are,

04:59.477 --> 05:01.978
opening your own front door.

05:02.012 --> 05:04.147
No need for security.

05:04.181 --> 05:07.550
Samuel Boggs. I know your father, Henry.

05:07.584 --> 05:08.684
"Knew" him.

05:08.718 --> 05:10.053
He was killed three months ago.

05:10.087 --> 05:11.487
That's no surprise.

05:11.521 --> 05:14.190
Guy had a mean streak. It
was just a matter of time.

05:14.224 --> 05:17.726
Well, that's true enough.

05:17.761 --> 05:19.195
No running.

05:19.229 --> 05:21.296
Running is the problem.

05:21.331 --> 05:22.765
I asked my dad once, uh,

05:22.799 --> 05:24.467
what's the point in being a wolf

05:24.501 --> 05:27.235
if you just get herded
around like a little sheep?

05:27.270 --> 05:29.672
And he reminded me that, uh,

05:29.706 --> 05:32.407
only the Pack gets to set down roots.

05:32.442 --> 05:33.642
What do you want, Mr. Boggs?

05:33.677 --> 05:37.012
What do I want? I want what you got.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.781
Only, I don't want to
follow any of your rules.

05:39.815 --> 05:41.916
Word is, Pack's weak.

05:41.951 --> 05:45.720
And there's only one way to
become top dog, ain't I right?

05:48.524 --> 05:49.657
Clayton!

05:49.692 --> 05:50.993
You want to challenge for Alpha,

05:51.027 --> 05:52.594
and word is the Pack's weak?

05:52.628 --> 05:53.962
You haven't thought this through.

05:53.996 --> 05:56.698
I'll give you one chance...

05:56.732 --> 05:59.200
to make...

05:59.234 --> 06:02.637
the right decision.

06:09.177 --> 06:11.112
My nose!

06:12.814 --> 06:14.382
I see your face here again,

06:14.416 --> 06:16.117
I'll reunite you with your father.

06:17.785 --> 06:19.453
I think he got the message.

07:01.617 --> 07:03.172
I hope your sister doesn't mind

07:03.195 --> 07:04.961
us not sticking to her list, but...

07:05.318 --> 07:07.185
napkin rings? A gravy boat?

07:07.219 --> 07:10.670
What does a 25-year-old need
with matching cream and sugar?

07:10.718 --> 07:13.386
How much you want to bet my
mother helped out with that list?

07:17.352 --> 07:19.453
I could swear there
used to be a card store

07:19.487 --> 07:20.654
right here.

07:20.689 --> 07:23.023
I'm sorry, I'm...

07:24.759 --> 07:26.993
Hey, I want to pop in
this gallery for a minute.

07:27.028 --> 07:29.129
- Elena?
- Yeah.

07:29.163 --> 07:31.598
- Everything okay?
- Sure.

07:43.477 --> 07:45.378
Grilled cheese for your thoughts?

07:46.614 --> 07:49.482
Apparently, you can
already read my mind.

07:49.516 --> 07:51.284
Looks delicious. What's in it?

07:51.318 --> 07:54.153
- It's a secret family recipe.
- Ah.

07:54.187 --> 07:55.821
I'm willing to tell you

07:55.856 --> 07:57.690
if you're willing to reciprocate.

07:57.725 --> 08:00.559
You know I don't cook.

08:00.593 --> 08:03.595
And you know that's not
what I'm talking about.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.731
You've been quiet since we got back.

08:14.007 --> 08:16.108
I didn't want to say anything...

08:20.346 --> 08:22.914
But I thought I saw someone today...

08:26.619 --> 08:30.155
A... neighbour of one
of my foster families.

08:33.058 --> 08:36.828
His name is Victor Olson. He...

08:38.764 --> 08:42.667
He had a coop in his backyard
where he raised rabbits.

08:45.171 --> 08:49.040
He used the rabbits as a lure, and...

08:49.074 --> 08:51.609
the coop as something else.

09:05.023 --> 09:09.426
I still think I see him
sometimes, you know.

09:09.460 --> 09:12.029
And he's not even really there.

09:14.498 --> 09:16.666
Which is crazy because he's locked up.

09:16.701 --> 09:19.203
I helped put him there.

09:22.006 --> 09:23.206
He hurt you?

09:24.775 --> 09:26.008
I mean, physically?

09:34.652 --> 09:37.520
Promise you won't see
me as damaged goods.

09:37.555 --> 09:39.655
There's not a single
thing you could tell me

09:39.689 --> 09:41.190
that would change the way I see you.

09:51.902 --> 09:54.904
You sure it was Santos?

09:54.938 --> 09:56.872
I can't be sure it was him, no.

09:56.906 --> 09:59.742
'Cause you know Daniel Santos.
The man loves to play games.

09:59.776 --> 10:01.510
I know.

10:01.544 --> 10:03.846
He had no interest in
re-joining the Pack.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.814
He just wanted to stir the pot.

10:05.849 --> 10:07.349
And he may be doing the same here.

10:07.384 --> 10:09.551
Have you told Jeremy?

10:09.586 --> 10:11.152
No.

10:11.187 --> 10:12.387
And I don't plan on it.

10:12.421 --> 10:14.522
- Elena...
- I asked Jeremy

10:14.556 --> 10:16.892
not to call me,

10:16.926 --> 10:19.560
and I'd like to maintain it from my side.

10:19.595 --> 10:21.162
Okay, well...

10:21.197 --> 10:24.332
Just keep your eyes open
and be careful, okay?

10:24.367 --> 10:25.533
Yeah.

10:28.170 --> 10:31.272
There's something else.

10:34.242 --> 10:37.177
I had to lie to Philip.

10:37.212 --> 10:39.313
I... I couldn't tell him about Santos,

10:39.347 --> 10:42.016
so I panicked and told him...

10:42.050 --> 10:44.652
about Victor Olson.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.021
But Victor Olson is a part of your past.

10:47.055 --> 10:48.956
Yeah, but that just
feels like a loophole.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.757
No, it's quite the opposite.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.360
You named the beast, Elena. That's huge.

10:53.395 --> 10:54.956
How many of us know about Victor Olson?

10:54.963 --> 10:57.464
Me. Clay... Does Jeremy even know?

10:58.800 --> 11:00.100
No.

11:00.135 --> 11:01.868
You got to give yourself some credit.

11:01.903 --> 11:04.037
The truth you told him levelled a wall.

11:08.943 --> 11:11.210
He asked me to move in with him.

11:14.148 --> 11:16.750
And?

11:16.784 --> 11:21.687
I mean, I'm there all the time, right?

11:21.721 --> 11:24.324
But giving up my own space?

11:24.358 --> 11:26.292
How do you manage it so well?

11:26.327 --> 11:28.527
Who says I'm managing anything well?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.931
Logan, you guys have been
living together for two years.

11:31.966 --> 11:33.899
How long do you think you
can keep it from her?

11:33.934 --> 11:37.202
I've told her everything,
except for <i>the</i> thing.

11:37.236 --> 11:38.437
She knows everyone's name.

11:38.472 --> 11:39.905
She knows about Stonehaven.

11:39.940 --> 11:44.477
But telling Philip about
Victor Olson is one thing.

11:44.511 --> 11:49.214
How could I ever possibly
explain Clay to him?

11:49.248 --> 11:50.583
Well, that shouldn't be a problem

11:50.617 --> 11:53.418
as long as you've really moved on.

11:53.453 --> 11:55.420
You can't let your past with Clay

11:55.455 --> 11:57.389
colour your future with Philip.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.268
Did you clean out the liquor store?

12:11.303 --> 12:13.371
I just want everything to be perfect.

12:15.474 --> 12:18.810
Becky was stressing about doing
this at my mother's house.

12:18.844 --> 12:23.180
Offering my place is going to
save my family infinite anxiety.

12:23.215 --> 12:25.049
It's going to be perfect.

12:25.083 --> 12:30.321
Well, it wasn't exactly my
place to offer up, was it?

12:30.355 --> 12:31.622
Well, I don't mind.

12:33.925 --> 12:37.928
Remember that thing that you
said about the cleaning service?

12:37.962 --> 12:39.830
Yeah, how it makes you hot?

12:39.864 --> 12:41.632
No.

12:41.666 --> 12:43.901
How you said you'd get one if I moved in.

12:47.805 --> 12:51.074
Yeah, it might just be me
in a French maid outfit.

12:51.108 --> 12:54.044
Sold.

12:54.078 --> 12:57.047
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

12:57.081 --> 12:58.714
But, look, just so we're clear,

12:58.749 --> 13:01.184
this means my stuff all
over your bedroom floor,

13:01.218 --> 13:03.219
this means my protein bars everywhere,

13:03.254 --> 13:05.522
- it means...
- This means I love you.

13:06.990 --> 13:08.525
Hmm. I love you too.

13:08.559 --> 13:11.694
What are your plans this afternoon?

13:11.728 --> 13:13.430
Why, what did you have in mind?

13:13.464 --> 13:16.666
Let's go pack up your stuff.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.968
Really?

13:19.002 --> 13:20.770
Okay.

13:20.804 --> 13:22.672
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

13:22.706 --> 13:25.274
<i>Dennis Stillwell is dead.</i>

13:25.308 --> 13:26.576
Are you sure?

13:26.610 --> 13:28.878
Yeah.

13:28.912 --> 13:30.446
I'm sure.

13:30.480 --> 13:33.182
He's been dead two days
by the smell of this place.

13:33.216 --> 13:35.584
- What about Joey?
<i>- There's only one body.</i>

13:35.618 --> 13:38.187
<i>Looks like they tortured
Dennis before they killed him.</i>

13:38.221 --> 13:40.755
He didn't go quietly though.

13:43.226 --> 13:45.727
They took his eyes.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.395
You've got to clean up the place, Nick.

13:47.429 --> 13:48.697
Sanitize it.

13:48.731 --> 13:50.765
Yeah, it'll take some time, but...

13:50.800 --> 13:53.267
I'll wipe it down...

13:53.302 --> 13:55.704
find a quiet place to bury Dennis.

13:55.738 --> 13:57.072
Nothing will point back to us.

13:57.106 --> 13:58.406
It's what they want.

13:58.440 --> 14:01.710
Keep us tied up cleaning up their mess.

14:01.744 --> 14:03.277
Any idea who did it?

14:03.312 --> 14:05.346
Judging by the smell,
I'm pretty sure it was Cain

14:05.380 --> 14:06.714
and that Mutt from the motel.

14:06.748 --> 14:08.149
What about Marsten?

14:08.183 --> 14:09.717
<i>No sign of him. Just the other two.</i>

14:09.751 --> 14:11.352
I can be there in four hours.

14:11.386 --> 14:13.187
No, no, no. By the time
you get here, I'll be done.

14:13.222 --> 14:15.289
Come back once you've cleaned up, Nick.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.202
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:39.236 --> 14:42.439
Ugh! I did this herbal diet to
try and lose a couple of pounds,

14:42.473 --> 14:44.874
and I ended up gaining three.
Total rip-off.

14:44.908 --> 14:46.842
Well, you look fabulous, really.

14:46.877 --> 14:48.978
Thank you again for having us here.

14:49.012 --> 14:52.915
Like, Mother would have completely
taken over if it was at her house.

14:52.950 --> 14:56.719
And I just really wanted this
to be about the four of us,

14:56.753 --> 14:58.888
you know, the women in my family,

14:58.922 --> 15:00.523
helping me get ready for my big day.

15:00.558 --> 15:02.491
Of course.

15:02.525 --> 15:04.126
- Mom?
- Mmm?

15:04.160 --> 15:07.296
This is the piece I've
been telling you about.

15:07.330 --> 15:09.531
It's very...

15:09.566 --> 15:10.733
Dramatic.

15:10.767 --> 15:13.636
It's gorgeous. Elena.

15:13.670 --> 15:16.238
- Yeah?
- You have to let me set up a show.

15:16.272 --> 15:18.240
Aren't you busy enough
with your actual clients?

15:18.274 --> 15:20.809
Don't be humble. People are
going to love your work.

15:20.843 --> 15:23.278
So tell me, Elena, as an artist,

15:23.313 --> 15:25.154
what do you think of
Becky's choice of flowers?

15:25.181 --> 15:26.861
It's too late to do
anything about them now.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.118
I realize that, but it's a fair question.

15:29.152 --> 15:30.619
- Mother.
- Oh...

15:30.653 --> 15:32.187
That's how I know I'm annoying them:

15:32.222 --> 15:34.555
all of a sudden, I'm "Mother".

15:34.590 --> 15:36.457
Fine. We don't have to have any flowers.

15:36.492 --> 15:39.293
As long as you're happy, Mother.

15:39.328 --> 15:41.596
And here we go.

15:43.432 --> 15:46.167
The Mutts are trying to
kill off our support network.

15:46.201 --> 15:48.302
Isolating us from the outside in.

15:48.337 --> 15:50.438
This complicates things.

15:50.472 --> 15:53.107
It's just a matter of time before the other
families find out about the Stillwells.

15:53.142 --> 15:56.310
Maybe it will rally them to our cause.

15:56.345 --> 15:58.979
Look, all the other
families are Sorrentinos.

15:59.014 --> 16:00.581
That's your blood.

16:00.616 --> 16:02.016
They're not going to turn
their back on you.

16:02.050 --> 16:03.751
Still, what happened to Dennis and Joey

16:03.785 --> 16:05.520
might put the fear of God in my cousins.

16:05.554 --> 16:07.434
Maybe we should negotiate
a truce with the Mutts.

16:07.455 --> 16:08.722
A truce?

16:08.757 --> 16:10.290
Perhaps an easing of the rules

16:10.324 --> 16:11.759
regarding territory ownership.

16:11.793 --> 16:15.095
A small concession on our
part might back them off.

16:15.130 --> 16:17.464
Jeremy, they already think you're weak.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.133
How long before the next Mutt comes by

16:19.167 --> 16:22.002
thinking he can challenge for Alpha?

16:22.037 --> 16:25.038
- Who came by?
- Samuel Boggs. Henry's son.

16:25.072 --> 16:26.839
The word's out.

16:26.874 --> 16:29.909
The longer we sit on our
hands, the harder it will be.

16:29.943 --> 16:33.446
I say strike back, hard.
Reinstate the Mutt Hunts.

16:33.481 --> 16:34.847
Kill the worst to teach the others

16:34.882 --> 16:38.718
that Jeremy can't be pushed around.

16:38.752 --> 16:41.287
Is that what you think, Clay?

16:45.292 --> 16:48.995
Do you think that I'm letting
them push me around?

16:52.900 --> 16:56.102
It's Boggs. He's back.

16:56.136 --> 16:57.336
Stay here.

17:09.949 --> 17:13.417
I have the right to challenge for Alpha.

17:13.452 --> 17:17.255
This time I want you,
not your little lapdog.

17:17.289 --> 17:19.324
Come in, Mr. Boggs.

17:19.358 --> 17:20.592
Thank you.

17:49.955 --> 17:52.223
They said you wouldn't fight.

17:52.257 --> 17:53.490
Who said that?

18:08.205 --> 18:09.640
Ahh!

18:09.674 --> 18:11.541
That's typical Mutt behaviour.

18:11.576 --> 18:13.443
Weapons aren't allowed, you know that.

18:15.313 --> 18:18.582
Oh... Okay, man. Okay, look, I quit.

18:18.616 --> 18:20.416
All right? Let me go.

18:20.450 --> 18:22.752
Please. Please!

18:22.787 --> 18:24.087
Let me go!

18:33.864 --> 18:35.431
Take him downstairs.

18:35.465 --> 18:37.533
You find out who said the Pack was weak

18:37.567 --> 18:39.001
and who sent him.

18:54.784 --> 18:56.285
Becky, you're being childish.

18:56.319 --> 18:57.920
Now we have a schedule to keep.

18:57.954 --> 18:59.521
Open the door!

18:59.555 --> 19:02.424
Go away.

19:02.458 --> 19:03.892
Maybe let me try and talk to her?

19:03.927 --> 19:05.527
You barely know her.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.595
I mean, that's the point,
right? I'm an outsider.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.731
It couldn't hurt.

19:09.765 --> 19:13.301
Why not? She clearly doesn't
want to talk to us.

19:13.336 --> 19:15.837
- Work your magic.
- Okay.

19:23.946 --> 19:27.448
Becky? It's Elena. Can you let me in?

19:27.482 --> 19:30.885
I really don't want to talk
to anyone right now.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.654
Your mom and your sister
are in the kitchen.

19:33.688 --> 19:34.956
It's just me.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.131
Hi.

19:49.303 --> 19:51.505
I'm sorry.

19:51.539 --> 19:54.140
Normally I can handle my mother's
passive-aggressive barbs,

19:54.175 --> 19:57.511
but I'm just a little off today.

19:57.545 --> 19:59.212
No, it's fine.

19:59.247 --> 20:00.480
I mean, it's a big day.

20:00.514 --> 20:01.814
It's not just that.

20:01.849 --> 20:03.383
I don't know if my brother told you,

20:03.417 --> 20:05.285
but I take antidepressants.

20:05.319 --> 20:08.755
That kind of helps to level
out the peaks and valleys.

20:08.789 --> 20:11.824
I didn't know that.

20:11.859 --> 20:14.261
And I didn't want my emotions
to flat-line on my wedding day,

20:14.295 --> 20:15.928
so I stopped taking them.

20:15.962 --> 20:17.764
Maybe not the best idea,

20:17.798 --> 20:22.034
considering this wedding has
my mother dialled up to 11.

20:22.068 --> 20:23.770
You mean the flowers?

20:23.804 --> 20:26.539
It's not just the
flowers, it's the groom.

20:26.573 --> 20:29.108
She's been fighting me every
single step of the way

20:29.142 --> 20:31.743
with this wedding.

20:31.778 --> 20:34.046
She doesn't like Colin?

20:34.080 --> 20:37.016
He is amazing.

20:37.050 --> 20:39.551
He's just the right amount of crazy.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.553
I don't know, I mean...

20:41.587 --> 20:45.757
It's like I'm completely
myself with him.

20:45.792 --> 20:47.959
So what's the problem?

20:47.993 --> 20:52.163
I guess there's a part of me
that worries my mother is right.

20:52.197 --> 20:53.932
Colin is still trying
to figure things out.

20:53.966 --> 20:57.836
And like, what if he never
gets his shit together?

20:57.870 --> 21:00.806
Then you'll figure it out together.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.741
Okay?

21:02.775 --> 21:05.876
Love is messy.

21:05.911 --> 21:08.779
Who we fall in love with
doesn't always make sense.

21:08.814 --> 21:13.617
But when it's right...

21:13.652 --> 21:16.220
it's bigger than both of you, okay?

21:19.191 --> 21:22.059
I was just kidding! Come on.

21:22.093 --> 21:24.328
What the hell is this place?

21:24.362 --> 21:25.729
No, I'm not going in there.

21:25.764 --> 21:28.432
Ah, don't put me in there!

21:28.467 --> 21:29.733
Don't put me... No!

21:29.768 --> 21:31.401
No, no! No!

21:34.940 --> 21:37.107
Come on, man.

21:37.141 --> 21:38.342
Let me out.

21:43.029 --> 21:44.396
Undo my arms, man.

21:44.431 --> 21:46.916
Come on, my shoulder's killing me.

21:47.572 --> 21:50.041
San Diego three days ago.

21:50.075 --> 21:53.410
Albuquerque. Fort Worth.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.746
St. Louis. Lexington.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.882
You made good time getting here.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.583
I'll go back there.

21:59.617 --> 22:01.219
You'll never see me again.

22:04.389 --> 22:08.191
Gas. Fast food. No motels.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.794
I slept off the road, by my bike.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.300
Ahh, man...

22:21.339 --> 22:23.106
What was the rush?

22:23.140 --> 22:25.508
It was a stupid idea, man.

22:38.021 --> 22:40.923
Who told you to come?

22:40.957 --> 22:42.759
Nobody. I heard a rumour...

22:47.097 --> 22:48.230
I swear to God!

22:48.265 --> 22:50.800
I know somebody put you up to it.

22:50.834 --> 22:52.768
Somebody's paying you.

22:52.802 --> 22:54.703
Nah. No way.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.738
You do your taxes?

22:56.773 --> 22:58.573
What?

22:58.608 --> 23:01.443
Income taxes.

23:01.477 --> 23:05.514
I've never paid taxes in my life.

23:05.548 --> 23:10.184
Then why did you keep all your receipts?

23:10.219 --> 23:11.720
I, uh...

23:11.754 --> 23:14.289
I didn't...

23:23.499 --> 23:25.199
You thought you could charge expenses

23:25.234 --> 23:27.768
to whoever is paying you.

23:33.342 --> 23:34.542
I thought so.

23:41.417 --> 23:44.051
You're going to tell me
everything I want to know.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.697
What are you doing home? You okay?

23:56.731 --> 24:00.400
Leo heard me puking and freaked
out about me handling food.

24:00.435 --> 24:02.135
You look green.

24:02.170 --> 24:03.503
I'm going to make you
some tea or something.

24:03.537 --> 24:04.972
No, no, it's okay.

24:05.006 --> 24:07.574
I'm still feeling kind of nauseous.

24:10.078 --> 24:12.712
Maybe you got that bug
that's been going around.

24:14.248 --> 24:15.548
I don't think it's the flu.

24:26.226 --> 24:27.794
Like I said,

24:27.828 --> 24:29.529
I don't think it's the flu.

24:49.582 --> 24:50.782
I need a cocktail.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.020
I'll make it two.

24:59.158 --> 25:01.527
I don't know what you said
to Becky this afternoon,

25:01.561 --> 25:04.453
but I do appreciate your help.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.507
She was just a little
nervous, that's all.

25:06.531 --> 25:08.747
She's off her meds, isn't she?

25:08.787 --> 25:12.323
Oh... I know all about
the antidepressants.

25:12.357 --> 25:15.726
For some reason, my kids think that
they should hide things from me.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.462
Becky just doesn't want
to disappoint you.

25:18.496 --> 25:20.697
A mother's life is full
of disappointments.

25:20.732 --> 25:23.500
I'm disappointed
Diane's marriage failed,

25:23.535 --> 25:26.570
that Becky's career isn't
what she wanted it to be.

25:26.604 --> 25:29.205
My son and his girlfriend
need to keep it a secret

25:29.240 --> 25:31.107
that they're living together.

25:31.142 --> 25:32.642
We just didn't want to step

25:32.676 --> 25:35.111
on Becky's big day, that's all.

25:37.081 --> 25:40.083
Look, you raised three amazing children.

25:41.085 --> 25:42.685
You should be proud.

25:42.719 --> 25:46.056
Not just of them, but of
yourself as their mother.

25:48.092 --> 25:49.291
Thank you.

25:57.634 --> 25:59.869
Elena?

25:59.903 --> 26:01.437
Would you excuse me?

26:06.742 --> 26:08.444
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

26:08.478 --> 26:09.611
Who was that?

26:09.645 --> 26:11.847
It was a cousin of Colin's, I think.

26:14.351 --> 26:16.118
Um, I'm just going to go freshen up.

26:16.152 --> 26:18.687
- See you in a couple of seconds.
- Okay.

26:18.721 --> 26:19.955
- Hurry back.
- Okay.

26:29.031 --> 26:31.633
Sorry I missed the ceremony.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.535
What the hell are you doing here?

26:33.569 --> 26:36.137
We have some things to talk about.

26:37.172 --> 26:38.473
You have five seconds.

26:38.507 --> 26:40.141
It's not what you think.

26:40.175 --> 26:41.709
I'm here 'cause I'm worried about you.

26:41.743 --> 26:43.378
You're worried about me.

26:43.412 --> 26:46.280
You have no idea what's really
happening back at Stonehaven.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.949
Okay, you know what, I've had
enough of your lies about Clay

26:48.984 --> 26:50.618
for one lifetime. Thanks.

26:51.853 --> 26:53.988
They aren't lies.

26:54.023 --> 26:56.891
Jeremy and the others haven't
been entirely honest with you.

26:56.925 --> 26:58.125
What, and you have?

26:58.159 --> 26:59.994
I tried to warn you.

27:00.028 --> 27:01.996
Clay is out of control.

27:02.030 --> 27:03.430
The Mutts killed Pete
to get back at him,

27:03.464 --> 27:04.965
and from what I hear,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.835
he just laid a beating on
some guy named Samuel Boggs.

27:07.869 --> 27:09.703
No, you're lying.

27:09.738 --> 27:12.205
Call him. Ask him.

27:13.807 --> 27:15.042
He's dangerous.

27:16.804 --> 27:18.165
I just fear that soon, that danger

27:18.179 --> 27:20.047
is going to land on your doorstep.

27:22.134 --> 27:24.494
So when Nick gets back, we'll
deal with any fallout from it.

27:28.455 --> 27:29.756
Anything?

27:29.790 --> 27:32.859
Marsten put him up to it.

27:32.893 --> 27:35.862
Filled his head with dreams
of running the show.

27:35.896 --> 27:38.431
Mutt was stupid enough to
think he had a chance.

27:38.465 --> 27:41.500
Marsten had to know
that it wouldn't work.

27:41.535 --> 27:42.735
This is a distraction.

27:42.770 --> 27:45.003
They're playing games with us.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.339
I'll bandage Boggs up
and send him packing.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.943
I doubt he'll come within a hundred
miles of this place again.

27:50.977 --> 27:54.480
No more half measures.

27:54.514 --> 27:57.216
You really think that's necessary?

27:57.250 --> 27:59.918
I want to make an example of him.

27:59.953 --> 28:02.153
I want word to get out
that if you come at me,

28:02.188 --> 28:04.756
there will be serious consequences.

28:17.203 --> 28:21.206
See, if it were up to Clay,

28:21.240 --> 28:23.874
he'd wipe out the Mutt
population singlehandedly.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.716
You just ruined a $50 Casanegra.

28:31.750 --> 28:34.218
Oh, Marsten's brand.

28:34.252 --> 28:35.452
Coincidence?

28:38.657 --> 28:40.024
Karl and I met,

28:40.058 --> 28:41.358
we talked, we parted ways.

28:41.392 --> 28:43.928
I took a cigar for the road.

28:43.962 --> 28:45.630
What did you talk about?

28:45.664 --> 28:47.397
The events of the past month.

28:47.432 --> 28:49.533
The violence, the deaths.

28:49.567 --> 28:51.301
Events that you had nothing to do with.

28:51.336 --> 28:53.637
I'm just making sure I don't
get caught in the middle.

28:53.671 --> 28:55.572
Oh, the middle?

28:55.607 --> 28:57.973
Whatever happened to wanting
to re-join the Pack?

28:58.008 --> 29:00.510
Yeah, well that's never
going to happen, is it?

29:00.544 --> 29:04.347
Right, 'cause you never really
wanted it in the first place.

29:04.381 --> 29:06.516
Elena,

29:06.550 --> 29:10.786
right now, you and I are both outsiders.

29:10.820 --> 29:13.421
We don't have to take part in this war.

29:14.590 --> 29:16.291
- I'm not.
- Marsten and his crew

29:16.325 --> 29:18.761
consider you aligned with
Jeremy and the Pack,

29:18.795 --> 29:21.764
makes you their enemy.

29:21.798 --> 29:23.498
I can protect you from what's to come.

29:23.533 --> 29:25.134
I doubt that.

29:25.168 --> 29:27.069
Well... you forget...

29:27.103 --> 29:28.937
you're a long way from Stonehaven.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.211
You got a good life here.

29:36.245 --> 29:37.979
There's people that care about you.

29:38.013 --> 29:39.947
Don't mess with that

29:39.982 --> 29:43.451
by running back to fight for
something you don't even believe in.

29:45.254 --> 29:47.354
You're putting yourself
at risk for nothing.

29:50.893 --> 29:53.460
Oh, kinky!

30:01.403 --> 30:03.103
Align with me

30:03.137 --> 30:08.542
and the two of us can step
outside of this mess together.

30:08.577 --> 30:11.412
I'd rather die.

30:11.446 --> 30:12.646
Too bad.

30:14.949 --> 30:16.450
Oh...

30:16.484 --> 30:18.419
give my regards to Jeremy...

30:18.453 --> 30:20.320
when you see him.

30:44.709 --> 30:47.511
Okay, so just so we're clear:

30:47.545 --> 30:48.778
two lines means...

30:48.813 --> 30:50.514
We're pregnant.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.150
Oh!

30:54.184 --> 30:55.886
"Oh" is right.

31:01.492 --> 31:02.759
I asked her to move in,

31:02.793 --> 31:04.193
she said, "Yes."

31:04.228 --> 31:07.763
I don't know why you would
try to hide that from me.

31:07.797 --> 31:10.233
We were waiting for the
right moment to tell you,

31:10.267 --> 31:12.768
which I guess is right now.

31:14.971 --> 31:16.605
Look at you.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.908
Seems like it was five minutes ago
you were running around in diapers.

31:18.942 --> 31:21.844
<i>You raised me to make good choices</i>

31:21.878 --> 31:23.012
<i>in my life.</i>

31:23.046 --> 31:25.648
<i>Trust that this is a good one.</i>

31:25.682 --> 31:27.883
<i>Let her in, Mom.</i>

31:27.918 --> 31:29.952
<i>Let yourself love her.</i>

31:29.986 --> 31:33.355
<i>She's not going anywhere anytime soon.</i>

31:44.200 --> 31:45.633
Hey!

31:45.668 --> 31:49.271
Looks like the pressure's
off us, for now.

31:49.305 --> 31:50.439
Hello.

31:50.473 --> 31:51.773
I've been trying to reach you.

31:51.807 --> 31:53.007
Are you okay?

31:53.042 --> 31:54.842
Why wouldn't I be?

31:54.877 --> 31:56.444
<i>Dennis Stillwell has been murdered,</i>

31:56.478 --> 31:58.780
<i>and Joey's missing.</i>

31:58.814 --> 32:01.382
I'm concerned about your safety.

32:02.618 --> 32:03.785
<i>Elena?</i>

32:03.819 --> 32:06.788
Yeah, I'm here.

32:06.822 --> 32:08.723
Everything's fine.

32:08.757 --> 32:11.158
You need to stay in touch if anything
out of the ordinary happens,

32:11.193 --> 32:12.793
you know that.

32:12.827 --> 32:13.994
I will.

32:16.064 --> 32:18.632
Like I said, everything's fine.

32:19.968 --> 32:21.235
I really have to go.

32:27.476 --> 32:30.043
Could I steal him for a dance?

32:30.078 --> 32:33.213
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

32:46.327 --> 32:47.494
This isn't happening.

32:47.528 --> 32:48.995
Hey, it's going to be okay.

32:49.029 --> 32:51.231
I have waited three years for my shot.

32:51.265 --> 32:53.199
I finally got a chance
at taking over from Leo

32:53.234 --> 32:54.601
when he leaves to start his own place.

32:54.635 --> 32:56.503
Plus, you've got your practice,

32:56.537 --> 32:59.572
never mind the fact that we
haven't even talked about kids.

32:59.607 --> 33:01.841
Grownups don't screw up like this.

33:01.875 --> 33:05.210
I've... been so busy, I haven't been
keeping track of, you know, things.

33:05.245 --> 33:08.313
Honestly, I don't even
know how far along I am.

33:08.348 --> 33:10.182
I mean, what are we going to do?

33:10.216 --> 33:12.785
We could start by asking the
question, "Do we want a child?"

33:14.621 --> 33:15.921
Maybe...

33:15.956 --> 33:17.156
eventually.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.491
But now? I...

33:19.526 --> 33:22.161
I'm not sure.

33:22.195 --> 33:23.428
What about you?

33:23.463 --> 33:24.763
I'm not sure either.

33:24.797 --> 33:26.365
So we're back to where we started.

33:26.399 --> 33:28.967
- Which is?
- I don't know!

33:29.001 --> 33:32.037
Can you stop treating me
like one of your clients?

33:32.071 --> 33:33.572
Would you like to take
this into your office

33:33.606 --> 33:36.107
and charge me for a visit?

33:36.142 --> 33:37.341
Rachel, come back.

33:37.376 --> 33:39.044
Session's over, Logan.

33:39.078 --> 33:40.278
Rachel!

33:48.253 --> 33:50.954
Do you want to get out of here?

33:50.989 --> 33:53.991
Where are we going?

33:54.025 --> 33:57.428
Back to our place.

33:57.462 --> 34:00.431
Our place.

34:00.465 --> 34:03.033
I like the sound of that.

34:03.068 --> 34:04.802
I'm just going to grab my jacket.

34:04.836 --> 34:06.036
Okay.

34:10.574 --> 34:12.076
- Hi.
- Hi.

34:12.110 --> 34:14.745
- I'll get that for you.
- Leaving already?

34:17.447 --> 34:18.716
Uh...

34:18.750 --> 34:19.917
Yeah.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.620
Is everything all right?

34:26.056 --> 34:29.326
You impressed me today with...

34:29.360 --> 34:32.629
with Becky and with
the rest of my family.

34:32.663 --> 34:35.931
And Philip is very lucky to have you.

34:38.735 --> 34:41.237
I'm the lucky one.

34:46.610 --> 34:47.810
Thank you.

35:00.457 --> 35:01.657
Hello?

35:01.691 --> 35:02.924
Hey.

35:02.959 --> 35:04.426
Hey, um...

35:04.461 --> 35:06.962
How's the big city?

35:06.996 --> 35:09.565
I can't really talk right now.

35:14.603 --> 35:17.105
Clay, what's wrong?

35:19.408 --> 35:21.476
I've done things...

35:22.478 --> 35:25.213
<i>necessary things.</i>

35:25.248 --> 35:26.681
Clay...

35:26.715 --> 35:30.017
They're coming at us hard, darlin', I...

35:30.051 --> 35:33.655
I feel like I'm barely
holding my head above water.

35:33.689 --> 35:35.390
Look... It won't end well

35:35.424 --> 35:38.393
if it keeps going like this, Clay.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.627
I know.

35:44.366 --> 35:46.934
I want to be a better man, Elena.

35:48.870 --> 35:50.104
I need you.

35:53.942 --> 35:55.209
Please come home.

36:47.059 --> 36:48.226
He, uh...

36:48.260 --> 36:50.395
he changed halfway through.

36:50.429 --> 36:53.931
Had to give him morphine to
force him back to human form.

36:56.736 --> 36:59.337
When he comes to, send him on his way.

37:01.706 --> 37:03.007
News will get back to Marsten.

37:23.928 --> 37:26.129
She left.

37:26.163 --> 37:27.364
Pardon me?

37:27.399 --> 37:28.866
The blonde woman you came in with.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.300
She left a few minutes ago.

37:52.692 --> 37:54.407
- Hi.
- Hey.

37:57.196 --> 38:00.832
Oh, I'm sorry. We made such a mess.

38:00.866 --> 38:03.234
I'm just going to grab my
tote and come back tomorrow

38:03.268 --> 38:05.035
to clean up if that's cool.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.804
Oh, yeah, don't worry about it.

38:06.838 --> 38:09.039
Okay.

38:09.074 --> 38:11.409
Where's Elena?

38:11.443 --> 38:12.643
She took off.

38:16.948 --> 38:20.584
A text message. That's it?

38:20.618 --> 38:24.454
An apology with no explanation.

38:24.488 --> 38:25.756
I think I need a drink.

38:29.460 --> 38:32.096
That girl knows how to keep me guessing.

38:35.366 --> 38:37.534
She loves you, Philip.

38:37.568 --> 38:39.836
I know that.

38:39.870 --> 38:42.439
Just when I think she's
starting to open up,

38:42.473 --> 38:44.374
she slams shut again.

38:44.408 --> 38:47.844
I'm sure it all makes
sense when you guys talk.

38:47.878 --> 38:49.613
I wish I was so convinced.

39:01.792 --> 39:04.060
Pink Himalayan salt.

39:04.094 --> 39:07.163
I had to scour the city to
find that at this hour.

39:07.197 --> 39:11.667
It's apology salt for the way
that I reacted when you told me.

39:11.701 --> 39:13.001
Babe...

39:13.035 --> 39:15.137
you don't need
to apologize for anything.

39:15.171 --> 39:17.973
At least I had some kind of
idea of what was going on.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.809
Might as well have
punched you in the gut.

39:20.843 --> 39:23.044
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

39:23.079 --> 39:25.414
I've been... I've been
running our conversation

39:25.448 --> 39:27.615
over and over in my head,

39:27.650 --> 39:29.517
and I love... love my job.

39:29.551 --> 39:32.654
I'm doing exactly what I want but...

39:32.688 --> 39:36.391
making a person with you
is kind of amazing.

39:36.425 --> 39:38.693
Yeah. It is amazing.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.863
Okay, I know it's a lot of
take in for both of us.

39:42.898 --> 39:45.667
So, I don't want to
make any decisions now.

39:45.701 --> 39:49.203
Okay? We need to let this sink in and...

39:49.237 --> 39:52.340
revisit our feelings in a couple days.

39:52.374 --> 39:53.741
Now you sound like the therapist.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.145
Aw, in that case...

39:58.180 --> 40:00.714
the next hour's all yours.

40:02.784 --> 40:04.651
Okay then.

40:17.498 --> 40:19.165
Still up?

40:19.200 --> 40:20.400
I was waiting.

40:34.381 --> 40:36.382
I should have been with you.

40:36.416 --> 40:37.683
We couldn't have known.

40:42.122 --> 40:43.622
Come.

40:55.669 --> 40:57.302
I kept...

40:57.337 --> 41:00.172
thinking of the time the
four of us went hunting

41:00.206 --> 41:04.042
up at Grandpa's property, long
before the Stillwells left the pack.

41:05.411 --> 41:08.646
You and Dennis taught Joey and
me how to flush out a deer.

41:10.716 --> 41:14.920
I kept thinking about
Joey losing his father...

41:14.954 --> 41:17.956
what if that was you,
lying dead on the ground...

41:17.991 --> 41:19.624
That's not going to be me.

41:19.658 --> 41:21.959
- You can't say that.
- No, you're right.

41:21.994 --> 41:23.395
You're right.

41:23.429 --> 41:24.929
But you're my son,

41:24.963 --> 41:26.731
and I want to protect
you from the truth,

41:26.766 --> 41:31.102
'cause the truth is that no one is safe.

41:31.136 --> 41:33.872
All we have is right now.

41:33.906 --> 41:38.842
And right now, what you
did for Dennis today?

41:38.877 --> 41:40.411
The way you put his body to rest:

41:40.445 --> 41:43.614
I'm so very proud of you, Nicholas.

41:43.648 --> 41:46.918
I'm so proud of you.

41:53.225 --> 41:55.025
All right.

41:55.059 --> 41:57.694
Let's go wake up the others.
We got a lot of work to do.

42:06.971 --> 42:08.739
I wasn't able to find Joey.

42:08.773 --> 42:10.808
But if he's alive and safe,

42:10.842 --> 42:14.344
he'll join us once he finds
out they killed his father.

42:14.378 --> 42:16.646
Whose death we will avenge right now.

42:16.680 --> 42:19.316
Marsten likes to play in the shadows.

42:19.350 --> 42:22.319
He has other people to do
his dirty work for him.

42:22.353 --> 42:24.254
Have to find a way to draw him out.

42:24.288 --> 42:27.023
Marsten's not the one
you should be worried about.

42:33.229 --> 42:36.298
Daniel Santos found me in Toronto.

42:36.333 --> 42:38.367
Santos did?

42:38.401 --> 42:39.569
Yeah.

42:41.972 --> 42:45.307
He had a lot to say.

42:45.342 --> 42:46.575
And he left this for you.

42:51.366 --> 42:53.868
You're not going to like what's inside.
