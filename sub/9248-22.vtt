00:02.872 --> 00:04.874
Previously onMike & Molly...Molly is a writer now.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.702
PEGGY [laughs]:
Oh!

00:06.789 --> 00:08.182
Why didn't you say so?

00:08.269 --> 00:11.489
Let me clear a spot
in my bookcase.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.282
MOLLY:
Victoria, I saw Carl

00:21.369 --> 00:22.935
in the hallway last night.

00:23.023 --> 00:26.200
I told him he should have
climbed out the window.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.462
[sighs]What were you thinking?

00:27.549 --> 00:29.203
I was thinking
nobody would see him

00:29.290 --> 00:31.553
if he climbed out the window.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.038
No matter how we feel
about each other,

00:38.125 --> 00:39.909
you're still my family.

00:39.996 --> 00:42.129
I guess we are kind of
stuck with each other.

00:42.216 --> 00:45.088
MIKE:
Well, a little setback

00:45.175 --> 00:46.568
in construction:
we thought we were

00:46.655 --> 00:48.135
cutting through
some old pipes

00:48.222 --> 00:49.658
and unfortunately
it was electrical conduit.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.747
I guess I'll have to
stay with family.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.924
I knew that was gonna
bite me in the ass.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.843
[Jim barking]

01:00.930 --> 01:03.367
Who's that cat?

01:03.454 --> 01:04.934
Get that cat.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.023
You better get that cat.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.503
Get him.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.852
What's going on?
It's Sunday morning.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.854
The neighbor's cat
is causing trouble.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.943
Just put the dog down.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.163
He's too short to see
out the window on his own.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.774
I know.
That's why I put him up there.

01:18.861 --> 01:19.818
[barking]Who's that cat?

01:19.905 --> 01:21.342
Get that cat.

01:21.429 --> 01:23.126
How long is she
gonna be here?

01:23.213 --> 01:24.997
Too long.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.917
Morning, young lovers.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.832
What are you
doing up so early?

01:33.919 --> 01:34.964
Making breakfast in bed
for Victoria.

01:35.051 --> 01:37.314
Speaking of which...

01:37.401 --> 01:39.142
where do you keep
your champagne flutes?

01:39.229 --> 01:40.143
Top shelf.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.102
Top shelf.

01:42.189 --> 01:45.061
Hey!

01:45.148 --> 01:47.324
Sit down!
I'll get 'em.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.675
Mmm.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.590
I must say, I outdid myself
with this coffee.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.201
I brought the beans
from my house.

01:54.288 --> 01:57.029
I know. We saw your beans
and half your beanstalk.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.119
Don't take this
the wrong way,

01:59.206 --> 02:02.034
but it's a little early
for th-this.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.385
Don't worry,
it took Mike a while

02:04.472 --> 02:06.300
to warm up to my sunny
disposition in the morning, too.

02:06.387 --> 02:07.649
You know, you get used to it.

02:07.736 --> 02:09.651
Or you don't.

02:09.738 --> 02:11.043
Hey. Love Machine.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.175
Is that your Blazer
in the driveway?

02:12.262 --> 02:13.350
You're blocking us in.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.699
Oh.
Wait.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.571
Are you wearing
my mini-mono?

02:16.658 --> 02:18.268
My apologies.
I will launder it

02:18.355 --> 02:20.140
after I move my car.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.706
Anybody else have any delicates
they want me to throw in?

02:21.793 --> 02:23.317
You got room
for a sweaty girdle?

02:23.404 --> 02:25.710
Mi washa es su washa.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.103
Hey, baby,
where's mama's mimosas?

02:27.190 --> 02:28.670
Mimosas?

02:28.757 --> 02:30.324
Change of plan:
we're getting drunk before noon.

02:30.411 --> 02:32.021
Well, if we're not
going to yoga,

02:32.108 --> 02:34.937
you can wash
my girdle, too.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.634
What is happening?

02:36.721 --> 02:39.550
Maybe we're dead
and this is hell.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.509
Now we got a party.
I'll get the glasses.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.685
[all yell]

02:43.772 --> 02:44.468
Congratulations.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.775
Thank you.

03:16.457 --> 03:18.285
Now that we both
have a Flynn girl,

03:18.372 --> 03:20.635
it opens up a whole new world
of social activities

03:20.722 --> 03:21.984
for the four of us.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.203
Couples tennis?
No.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.508
Four-handed bridge?
No.

03:24.595 --> 03:25.466
Chicken leg dominoes?

03:28.338 --> 03:31.820
Even if I knew what that was,
I'd still say no.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.561
Come on,
you got to work with me here.

03:33.648 --> 03:35.258
How am I supposed to be
the Barney to your Fred

03:35.345 --> 03:36.781
if we're not coming up with
funny adventures

03:36.868 --> 03:38.566
for our Wilma and Bettys?

03:38.653 --> 03:40.132
I need a break, Carl. Okay?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.570
I see you at work,
I see you at home,

03:42.657 --> 03:44.267
I see you at night,
I see you in the morning.

03:44.354 --> 03:45.703
You're everywhere I am.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.358
Like gum I sat in
that won't... shut... up.

03:48.445 --> 03:49.403
[sighs]

03:50.752 --> 03:52.667
Good morning, gentlemen.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.103
Why are you so happy?

03:54.190 --> 03:55.713
The same reason
you are so miserable.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.759
My roommate has been
rooming with you for...

03:59.848 --> 04:03.155
...five glorious days!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.157
Yeah, well, believe me,
the feeling is mutual.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.377
It's nice to be around people
who appreciate me.

04:07.464 --> 04:11.207
Who are they?
Do they live at my house, too?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.861
Seriously, why-why can't you
take Victoria

04:12.948 --> 04:14.428
to you and Samuel's apartment?

04:14.515 --> 04:18.693
Oh. Mike, please...
let's not rock the boat.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.521
Especially when one of
those boats has an empty bedroom

04:20.608 --> 04:23.088
and the new captain
likes to walk around it naked.

04:23.175 --> 04:25.090
You better not be
bare-assing it on my couch.

04:25.177 --> 04:28.877
Says the man whose butt cheeks
left a cocoa butter oil streak

04:28.964 --> 04:31.358
on my kitchen chairs.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.925
Hey, if you got a problem
with me moisturizing my buns,

04:34.012 --> 04:35.536
you better take it up
with your sister-in-law.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.841
'Cause she likes
her baby's behind

04:36.928 --> 04:38.060
to be like a baby's behind.

04:38.147 --> 04:41.106
Oh...

04:41.193 --> 04:44.022
He's all yours.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.593
[knocking]

04:49.680 --> 04:51.639
PEGGY:
Hello?

04:55.556 --> 04:57.122
Molly, you in there?

05:02.302 --> 05:04.086
I hear you.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.130
Oh. Hey.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.350
Is that you, Peggy?

05:07.437 --> 05:08.873
You know what,
sometimes this...

05:08.960 --> 05:12.355
Oh, my God, the door
sticks in the humidity.

05:12.442 --> 05:13.443
Here's your mail.

05:13.530 --> 05:14.836
Thank you.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.359
You sure pay a lot for cable.

05:16.446 --> 05:17.839
You read my mail?

05:17.926 --> 05:19.449
It was half opened.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.190
You might want to keep an eye
on your postman.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.453
I can't place his nationality,
but whatever it is,

05:23.540 --> 05:25.281
I don't care for it.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.501
[gasps]

05:27.588 --> 05:29.851
[whispers]:
Oh, my God.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.287
Oh, my God, I got in.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.115
What?
Oh! I got in!

05:33.202 --> 05:35.204
[laughs]
Wh-What is going
on with you?!

05:35.291 --> 05:37.075
The Iowa Writer's Workshop--

05:37.162 --> 05:39.077
I've been accepted into
their summer writing program!

05:39.164 --> 05:43.473
Never been a fan of Iowa--
full of pigs and Democrats.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.041
Okay, this is one of the most
prestigious writing programs

05:46.128 --> 05:47.608
in the entire country.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.174
I mean, they-they...
out of 1,600 applicants,

05:49.261 --> 05:51.742
they only accept ten,
and I am one of the ten.

05:51.829 --> 05:55.659
Wait a minute, are you actually
good at this writing thing?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.358
I am. I mean, I-I didn't think
I was this good.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.708
Oh. Are you sure they
didn't make a mistake?

06:00.795 --> 06:02.579
Uh, that's my name!

06:02.666 --> 06:04.407
Peggy, yeah, read that!
Read that!

06:04.494 --> 06:06.627
That's my name.All right.

06:06.714 --> 06:09.847
I'm gonna be living my dream
in Iowa for eight weeks.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.849
How are you gonna ruin that,
Peggy, huh?

06:11.936 --> 06:13.024
Eight weeks?

06:13.111 --> 06:14.374
Does Mike know about all this?

06:14.461 --> 06:17.202
Damn it, you always find a way.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.731
Hey, sweetie.

06:23.818 --> 06:24.732
Hey.

06:24.819 --> 06:25.341
Oh, why the long face?

06:25.428 --> 06:27.430
Oh.

06:29.650 --> 06:33.044
Victoria!
Honey, I'm home!

06:33.131 --> 06:34.437
I love this.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.221
It's like living
in a sitcom. [laughs]

06:38.136 --> 06:40.269
I hope they kill
off your character.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.620
This guy.
[laughs]

06:45.056 --> 06:47.319
Okay, okay.
Drop the bag.

06:47.407 --> 06:50.279
Just sit down, forget
about Carl and enjoy.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.716
Shake 'n Bake?
[chuckles]

06:52.803 --> 06:56.807
Either I did something good,
or you did something bad.

06:56.894 --> 06:58.461
What?

06:58.548 --> 06:59.810
No. I think you need
to stop pointing a finger

06:59.897 --> 07:02.247
and start licking a finger.
[laughs]

07:02.334 --> 07:04.815
Whoa. Is that
Shake 'n Bake?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.687
Not for you.Why? There's plenty.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.558
Vince, I'm just trying
to have a quiet dinner

07:08.645 --> 07:10.473
with my husband. Get out.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.649
I would love to, but Joyce
asked me to clean the fridge.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.346
And I should really get on that.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.522
Right now.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.786
At this most inopportune moment.

07:18.873 --> 07:21.005
Just give him
a piece of chicken.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.312
Two, or I'm defrosting
the freezer.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.574
I hope you choke.

07:24.661 --> 07:25.314
I might. Looks a little dry.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.403
Scram!

07:31.842 --> 07:33.888
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.759
There are seven people
in a three-bedroom house,

07:35.846 --> 07:37.935
and you're the only one I like.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.589
Well, I'm sure we'll
get through it.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.504
You know, sometimes we...

07:41.591 --> 07:43.811
we'll have to make sacrifices,
knowing that in the future

07:43.898 --> 07:45.900
it will all be worth it.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.163
I know. I know.
My mom will move back home,

07:48.250 --> 07:50.948
and then it'll
just be me and Carl

07:51.035 --> 07:54.169
and Victoria
and Joyce and Vince.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.779
Am I leaving anybody out?

07:55.866 --> 07:56.476
Only me.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.958
Hey, there's my boy!
How you doing?
Oh.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.830
Good, good.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.223
Yup, we're just... just
sitting down to a nice dinner.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.488
Chicken. Smart.
It'll cushion the blow.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.708
What blow?No blow, no blow.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.188
Here you go.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.103
Thank you. Good-bye.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.713
Whoa, whoa.
What the hell you doing?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.975
You're giving her
all the thighs.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.455
Give it up.
You been made.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.199
What is she talking about?

08:24.286 --> 08:26.244
I have some exciting news.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.855
More for her than you.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.031
Will you shut up.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.467
What is going on?

08:32.381 --> 08:35.645
Well, um...

08:35.732 --> 08:37.342
I've been accepted into
one of the most prestigious

08:37.429 --> 08:40.824
writing programs in the country.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.260
Honey, that's great!

08:42.347 --> 08:43.261
Yeah.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.350
In Iowa.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.878
For eight weeks.Okay, you know what?

08:50.965 --> 08:52.836
Now no chicken. Now
you get no chicken.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.926
No chicken.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.625
So you're gonna
leave me for two months?

08:58.712 --> 09:01.236
Or I'm gonna stay with you

09:01.323 --> 09:03.717
for ten months.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.327
Hmm?

09:05.414 --> 09:07.372
Who wants a thigh?
You want a thigh?

09:07.459 --> 09:10.332
Aw. Unbelievable!

09:11.333 --> 09:14.641
You did this on purpose.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.469
Yeah, maybe.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.297
Mike, it's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.690
Oh, I'm sure it is!

09:20.777 --> 09:22.300
I can't believe
you did this whole deal

09:22.387 --> 09:24.912
without even
talking to me about it.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.478
Well, we're about
it talking now.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.219
No, you're telling me.
Talking about it would be,

09:28.306 --> 09:29.830
"Honey, I'm thinking about
applying for an out-of-state

09:29.917 --> 09:32.441
workshop for a couple months.
You okay with that?"

09:32.528 --> 09:34.574
Are you okay with that?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.359
Not now I'm not, no.

09:37.446 --> 09:38.839
Keep it down.
I'm eating.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.014
Stay out of this.
Mike, would you just

09:40.101 --> 09:41.450
give me a chance
to explain?

09:41.537 --> 09:42.364
Something smells good.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.496
Chicken. It's not.

09:46.934 --> 09:49.153
I cannot believe
you're okay leaving me alone

09:49.240 --> 09:50.807
in this mental hospital.

09:50.894 --> 09:53.462
I'm sorry. I know I
should've handled it better,

09:53.549 --> 09:54.942
but, I mean, it's a very
prestigious program.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.421
You could at least try
to be happy for me.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.423
That's all I do
is be happy for you.

09:58.510 --> 10:01.426
I was happy for you
when you quit your job,

10:01.513 --> 10:03.559
I was happy for you
when you became a writer.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.865
Well, guess what?
I'm not happy you're going!

10:04.952 --> 10:07.607
And you don't seem
to care about that.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.308
Move your car, Barney!

10:13.395 --> 10:16.267
Coming, Fred!

10:26.190 --> 10:27.670
Oh, I really messed this up.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.716
Oh, good, you know.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.067
What do I do?

10:33.154 --> 10:35.156
I mean, I-I want
to attend this workshop,

10:35.243 --> 10:36.766
but not if it's gonna
jeopardize my marriage.

10:36.853 --> 10:37.898
Oh, please.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.377
Your marriage will be just fine.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.683
How do you know?

10:40.770 --> 10:41.989
Because I know
your husband.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.643
He'll whine,
he'll cry,

10:43.730 --> 10:45.993
he'll bitch, he'll moan,
then he'll come around.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.255
You think so?

10:47.342 --> 10:48.604
He hit the
jackpot with you.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.040
He knows that.
That's true.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.173
You could go to
an eight-week orgy

10:52.260 --> 10:53.478
and he'd still be waiting.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.394
With flowers.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.528
I don't know. He stormed out
on Shake 'n Bake.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.399
That is... that is big.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.141
It's real
simple, honey.

11:04.228 --> 11:06.317
When he comes back,
tell him you're sorry,

11:06.404 --> 11:08.624
say you screwed up,

11:08.711 --> 11:10.670
then you throw yourself
on your sword.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.759
Then you throw yourself on
his sword.

11:12.846 --> 11:14.499
Oh! Ugh.

11:14.586 --> 11:17.111
You can "ugh" all you want.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.939
That's solid advice.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.943
Why do I even talk to you two?

11:23.030 --> 11:24.814
Because you know
we'll tell you the truth.

11:24.901 --> 11:25.597
And you've driven
everyone else away.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.788
It's a very
prestigious program.

11:41.875 --> 11:42.527
Stop saying that word.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.485
All right.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.617
But me not saying it

11:45.705 --> 11:47.663
doesn't make it any
less mm-hmm-hmm.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.367
Why didn't she tell me she was
signing up for some workshop?

11:56.454 --> 11:58.630
I tell her everything.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.936
Uh, technically,
that's not true.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.285
What are you
talking about?

12:01.372 --> 12:02.722
Those girly magazines

12:02.809 --> 12:05.159
you get delivered
to my apartment.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.422
That's not about Molly.

12:07.509 --> 12:10.120
That's about me wanting to get
to them before Vince does.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.167
Once he paws through them,
they're no good to me.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.038
Listen, you
know this is

12:15.125 --> 12:17.301
a wonderful opportunity
for your wife.
I know.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.912
It's probably gonna open
a ton of doors for her.

12:18.999 --> 12:20.174
Then what's
the problem?

12:20.261 --> 12:21.392
Well, that's the problem.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.046
She gets back, she's gonna have

12:23.133 --> 12:25.483
all these new experiences
that I wasn't a part of.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.791
She's gonna write a novel,
get famous,

12:28.878 --> 12:31.141
and hang out with
all these literary types.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.187
She will hobnob, Carl.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.234
That's ridiculous.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.019
Worst case scenario, she
takes a lover on the side.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.764
With any luck,
a lesbian lover.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.119
You and me...

12:52.206 --> 12:53.729
we need a break.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.601
I get it, I get it.

12:56.688 --> 12:59.561
I'll just be over here.

12:59.648 --> 13:02.607
Give you a
little solitude.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.522
Let you gather
your thoughts.

13:04.609 --> 13:08.004
Be on your own
for a little...
Carl!

13:08.091 --> 13:10.050
All right,
all right.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.531
I do miss you.

13:22.802 --> 13:23.715
Hello.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.369
Oh.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
Hey. I didn't see you out here.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.373
I had to get the laundry in.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.940
I didn't want
your pervy neighbor

13:31.027 --> 13:34.596
climbing the fence
to sniff my intimates.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.728
Here, help me
fold this sheet.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.210
So...

13:40.297 --> 13:42.169
about this writing program...

13:42.256 --> 13:44.258
[sighs] Can we please
not talk about it?

13:44.345 --> 13:46.042
I know I'm selfish
and a horrible wife

13:46.129 --> 13:47.478
and I shouldn't go.

13:47.565 --> 13:48.915
You know,
when I was younger than you,

13:49.002 --> 13:51.091
I had a situation
just like you have.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.092
Really?

13:52.179 --> 13:53.180
Oh, yeah.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.921
Opportunity of a lifetime.

13:55.008 --> 13:57.532
They wanted to up me
to manager at Bennigan's.

13:57.619 --> 14:00.361
Are you messing with me?

14:00.448 --> 14:01.362
Nope.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.103
They really did.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.669
They wanted to send me
to Philly for training.

14:04.756 --> 14:05.757
Mike's dad had just
started on the force,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.238
and he didn't want me to go.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.197
So... I didn't go.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.112
Sorry, I'm just trying
to get my head around

14:12.199 --> 14:16.377
somebody telling you what to do
and you actually doing it.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.987
I was being the good wife.

14:18.074 --> 14:20.685
Ah. And that's what you think
I should do?

14:20.772 --> 14:22.122
Be the good wife?

14:22.209 --> 14:23.601
Hell no.

14:23.688 --> 14:26.387
That wifely duty crap
cost me my dream.

14:26.474 --> 14:29.390
I could have
been a manager,

14:29.477 --> 14:33.046
saved up, bought a franchise
and opened a restaurant.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.786
Maybe even had my own chain.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.007
Peggigan's.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.922
I had no idea.

14:40.009 --> 14:41.968
Well, you know me,

14:42.055 --> 14:44.927
I don't like to be a downer.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.320
I'm just saying,

14:46.407 --> 14:48.626
you love writing,
I love feeding people.

14:48.713 --> 14:52.587
I'd hate to see you make
the same mistake I did.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.851
Thank you for...

14:55.938 --> 14:58.985
sharing your...
Bennigan's dream with me.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.987
Don't mention it.

15:01.074 --> 15:02.858
I mean it.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.295
As far as the boy knows,
you're the selfish wife

15:05.382 --> 15:06.993
and I'm the sympathetic mother.
Got it?

15:07.080 --> 15:07.602
Got it.
Fold.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.132
Hey.
Hi.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.960
Where's Mike?
Oh, we got

15:18.047 --> 15:19.701
a new deal.
I can keep sleeping over

15:19.788 --> 15:21.398
as long as I give him
an eight-foot perimeter.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.399
Oh, he's closing in.

15:22.486 --> 15:22.704
I got to go.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.754
Hi.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.148
Hi.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.367
You, uh...

15:33.454 --> 15:35.717
mind if I join you?

15:35.804 --> 15:38.372
I was hoping you would.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.112
[sighs]

15:39.199 --> 15:40.591
Listen...

15:40.678 --> 15:43.420
I'm sorry I walked
out like that.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.031
Don't be.

15:45.118 --> 15:46.249
Well, it's just
the-the whole thing

15:46.336 --> 15:48.948
kind of took me
by surprise.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.993
Well, that's my fault.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.039
I should have included you
from the beginning.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.910
That would
have been nice.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.564
You know I would've
told you to go.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.348
I know.

15:58.435 --> 16:01.569
So why didn't
you tell me?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.614
I just figured...
I was never gonna get in,

16:03.701 --> 16:08.968
and I was too embarrassed
to even talk about it.

16:09.055 --> 16:13.189
Lady, you have no idea
how great you are.

16:13.276 --> 16:17.019
You're smart,
you're talented.

16:17.106 --> 16:18.716
Huh?

16:18.803 --> 16:22.198
And you can do anything
that you set that mind to.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.547
Thank you.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.422
I'm sorry I'm leaving you
here with the lunatics.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.424
Your Taser's working, right?

16:30.511 --> 16:31.991
[both laugh]

16:32.078 --> 16:33.514
Don't worry about me.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.472
'Cause you're gonna
go to that program

16:35.559 --> 16:37.431
and you're gonna write
something amazing.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.259
And it's gonna
sell so many books,

16:39.346 --> 16:41.391
we're gonna be able to
move out of this house.

16:41.478 --> 16:42.610
Ooh.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.265
And, uh...

16:45.352 --> 16:48.007
I will be your
proud husband

16:48.094 --> 16:50.487
as long as
you'll have me.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.230
Are you kidding?

16:54.317 --> 16:57.407
I'll have you as long as you're
willing to put up with me.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.974
That is a deal.
[chuckles]

16:59.061 --> 17:00.497
I hid some
Shake 'n Bake for you.

17:00.584 --> 17:01.890
Oh, I just fell in
love all over again.

I don't know

17:16.992 --> 17:18.733
what I'm more excited about:
you going back to college,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.256
or me not having to pay for it.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215

Now, now.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.390
Here's a little
walk around money.

17:23.477 --> 17:24.869
Oh. Thanks.Remember,

17:24.956 --> 17:27.046
if you're at
a frat party,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.091
never leave your

17:29.178 --> 17:30.875
I'm not going back tocollege,

17:30.962 --> 17:32.877
I'm just going to
a writing seminar atcollege.

17:32.964 --> 17:34.575
Hey, housewife
or freshman,

17:34.662 --> 17:37.491
a roofie doesn't
discriminate.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.014
I'm gonna miss you, Mol.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.624
Remember, if they
catch you with weed,

17:40.711 --> 17:42.496
campus police
aren't real cops.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.932
Yeah, I-I don't
have pot.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.499
I put some in your suitcase.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.240
It'll help you make friends.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.546
I already flushed it.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.809
Thank you.

17:51.896 --> 17:52.897
Well, now that
I'm actually going,

17:52.984 --> 17:55.248
I'm a little scared.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.293
Are you kidding?
This is scary.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.164
What you're doing is
going on an adventure.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.904
Now go get after it.

17:59.991 --> 18:01.254
Write that book,
get us the hell out of here.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.386
Don't worry about
your husband.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.388
I been taking care of
him for 35 years.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.086
I can do it for
eight more weeks.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.000
But not a day longer.Bye.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.394
Bye!
Have fun!

18:13.483 --> 18:15.659
So you got
everything you need?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.661
I think so.

18:17.748 --> 18:19.185
Did you write your name
in your underwear?
[laughs]

18:19.272 --> 18:20.969
I'm not going
away to camp.

18:21.056 --> 18:21.926
Aw, I'm not gonna get
a macaroni portrait?

18:22.013 --> 18:24.799
Oh, you still might.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.931
I guess this is it.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.455
Yeah, I guess so.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.847
Be safe.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.936
Okay.

18:32.023 --> 18:33.416
I'm gonna miss you.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.157
I'm gonna
miss you, too.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.245
PEGGY:
You saying I'm a bad mother?

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
Look at your two loser kids.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.293
VICTORIA: Hey, I'm one of
those loser kids!

18:40.380 --> 18:41.511

Get that bad man.

18:45.559 --> 18:46.386

Did you say "black man"?!

18:46.473 --> 18:47.430
