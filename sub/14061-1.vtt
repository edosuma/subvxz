00:01.134 --> 00:03.435
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>when calls the heart...</i>

00:03.437 --> 00:05.637
[abigail]: <i>There was a terrible</i>
<i>explosion in the mine.</i>

00:05.639 --> 00:08.407
You murdered half
the men in this town.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.042
<i>I'm bill avery.</i>
<i>I'm a forensic investigator.</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:12.611
<i>I'm here to build a case</i>
<i>against the mining company.</i>

00:12.613 --> 00:14.980
[gowen]: <i>All you're gonna do</i>
<i>is further hurt abigail stanton.</i>

00:14.982 --> 00:17.316
[abigail]: <i>He's married.</i>
<i>With a child.</i>

00:17.318 --> 00:19.284
[elizabeth]: <i>It was</i>
<i>the most enchanting evening</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:20.819
<i>Of my entire life.</i>

00:20.821 --> 00:22.054
What will
the next chapter bring?

00:22.056 --> 00:23.555
<i>Pleasure to meet you,</i>
<i>miss leveaux.</i>

00:23.557 --> 00:25.958
-And what brings you here?
<i>-My fiance.</i>

00:25.960 --> 00:27.092
[rosemary]: <i>You barely know</i>
<i>this elizabeth thatcher.</i>

00:27.094 --> 00:29.294
[jack]: I hope, over time,

00:29.296 --> 00:30.829
You're gonna see
that my heart is true.

00:30.831 --> 00:31.897
This is
where I belong.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.200
[â™ª]

01:00.260 --> 01:02.494
[â™ª]

01:02.496 --> 01:04.696
[carriage rumbling past]

01:06.966 --> 01:08.267
Hi, pockets!

01:08.269 --> 01:10.169
-Hey! It's teacher.
-Oh, let's go ask her.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.970
[giggling]

01:11.972 --> 01:13.439
Good morning,
miss thatcher!

01:13.441 --> 01:14.807
Good morning, children.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.108
Are you enjoying
your break?

01:16.110 --> 01:17.176
[overlapping]: Yeah!

01:17.178 --> 01:18.610
When do we get to
go back to school?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.479
Well, we have to
build a church first.

01:20.481 --> 01:21.680
When's that?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.649
Soon. And then
we'll have a new school.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.517
Great! See you later.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.119
[all, overlapping]: Bye!

01:27.121 --> 01:29.888
[kids laughing and chatting]

01:29.890 --> 01:31.857
[â™ª]

01:36.229 --> 01:38.063
Ready for
your riding lesson?

01:38.065 --> 01:40.833
Of course.
Why shouldn't I be?

01:40.835 --> 01:43.402
Well, it's just that you...
You seem a little queasy.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.906
I meant happy.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.208
[chuckles]

01:49.210 --> 01:50.142
Must be
because of that kiss.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.478
Oh. Did we kiss?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.379
Gosh, I don't remember.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.148
Well, I'd be happy
to refresh your memory.

01:56.150 --> 02:00.185
Um, maybe we should
start my lesson now.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.954
Sure, but can
I just say...

02:03.423 --> 02:05.090
That was the best kiss
I've ever had.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.758
All right, how many
women have you kissed?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.894
Not too many.
Five maybe?

02:10.029 --> 02:11.363
Did I say five?
I meant...

02:11.365 --> 02:12.931
Two. You and my mother.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.233
You expect me
to believe that?

02:15.502 --> 02:17.336
All right, well,

02:17.338 --> 02:19.271
How exactly am I
supposed to get up---

02:19.273 --> 02:20.439
[gasps]

02:22.408 --> 02:23.742
All right.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.911
Now, how do I
get him to move?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.313
Just tap your heels
gently against his sides.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.051
Whoa!

02:33.053 --> 02:35.754
No, no. I'm so sorry.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.523
When I said "whoa,"
I didn't mean to stop,

02:37.525 --> 02:38.891
I was just surprised.

02:38.893 --> 02:40.292
Elizabeth,
he's smart,

02:40.294 --> 02:42.194
But you really can't hold
a conversation with him.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.862
Try it again.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.531
Ahem.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.499
Come on.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.669
[relieved sigh]

02:54.440 --> 02:57.276
All right, how do I
get him to slow down?

02:58.978 --> 03:00.913
I said slow down.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.748
I didn't say stop.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.450
We can go
as slow as you like.

03:06.886 --> 03:09.421
[â™ª]

03:09.423 --> 03:11.490
Jack. Jack, look.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.427
[â™ª]

03:15.429 --> 03:16.828
I'm worried, jack.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.998
This trial means
everything to abigail.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.100
You think
there's even a chance

03:22.102 --> 03:24.069
They'll clear
noah stanton's name?

03:24.071 --> 03:25.637
I'm not
so sure anymore.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.172
I thought
it was good news

03:27.174 --> 03:28.840
When we lost
jedidiah black,

03:28.842 --> 03:30.175
But the new judge
makes the old coot

03:30.177 --> 03:31.577
Look like a saint.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.911
Do you know
the new judge?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.279
No. Not personally.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.614
Best thing we can do

03:35.616 --> 03:37.816
Is take it
one day at a time.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.687
[â™ª]

03:45.792 --> 03:48.126
And then jack and I
saw a couple of executives

03:48.128 --> 03:50.629
That the mining company
must have sent for the trial.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.698
They were talking
to gowen,

03:52.700 --> 03:53.932
And the judge was there, too.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.200
[sighs] oh.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.002
I don't know
what's going to happen,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.137
But I'm glad we're finally
going to have our day in court.

03:59.139 --> 04:00.939
Well, I am sure
that bill avery

04:00.941 --> 04:03.008
Will have evidence strong enough
to prove your case.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.042
I'm not sure
about anything

04:04.044 --> 04:05.944
When it comes to bill avery.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.348
Have you spoken to him yet?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.784
After seeing his wedding ring
and that picture of his family?

04:12.786 --> 04:15.687
I'll be interested to hear
how he explains that.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.656
You might want to do it

04:17.658 --> 04:19.124
Before you're sitting
next to him

04:19.126 --> 04:20.659
At the prosecutor's table.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.128
Oh, this is the last thing
I needed before the trial.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.796
I know.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.465
But the good news is,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.000
I hear that the attorney
prosecuting the case

04:28.002 --> 04:29.067
Is one of the best.

04:29.069 --> 04:32.204
From your lips to god's ears.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.713
[â™ª]

04:45.652 --> 04:47.586
[florence]:
Well, it's ironic, isn't it?

04:47.588 --> 04:49.254
Well, we should be happy
we finally have the money

04:49.256 --> 04:50.822
For our new church
and school,

04:50.824 --> 04:53.925
And instead, we're all
worried about this trial.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.227
Florence,
I've always found

04:55.229 --> 04:56.528
That the best way
to wash away worry

04:56.530 --> 04:57.696
Is through prayer.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.398
Who are you all waiting for?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.266
The prosecutor.
The stage is late.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.101
What do we even know
about this sam madison?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.670
We know he is willing
to come out here

05:04.672 --> 05:05.771
And fight for us.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.440
I dated
a sam madison once.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.709
Or was it sam mason?

05:10.711 --> 05:12.377
[rosemary chuckles]

05:12.379 --> 05:13.845
Who can remember?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.048
Maybe you should
keep a list.

05:16.050 --> 05:18.417
Well, that is
a great idea.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.453
I suppose it would
start with jack.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.556
Too bad
it won't end with him.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.857
You never know.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.226
Oh, look!

05:28.228 --> 05:29.628
Too bad
we lost black.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.063
Might've been tough,

05:31.065 --> 05:33.098
But at least
he was fair.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.233
I wish the same
could be said for parker.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.768
Good morning,
abigail.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.804
Is it?

05:38.806 --> 05:39.971
[horse whinnies]

05:39.973 --> 05:41.673
[door opens]

05:43.576 --> 05:46.311
This is first time
I've had a welcoming committee.

05:46.313 --> 05:50.449
Usually, I'm met by a few guns
and a marshall.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.417
Sorry to disappoint you.
And you would be?

05:52.419 --> 05:54.353
Madison.
Samantha madison.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.322
You're the prosecutor?

05:58.558 --> 05:59.691
In the flesh.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.994
I don't mean to sound
surprised, but...

06:02.996 --> 06:05.497
I'm a woman.
It's fine. I'm used to it.

06:08.267 --> 06:09.801
Constable
jack thornton.

06:09.803 --> 06:10.836
Welcome.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.338
I'm bill avery.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.673
I'm the forensic expert
on this case,

06:14.675 --> 06:15.774
And I must say,

06:15.776 --> 06:17.642
I am surprised.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.044
I trust you'll recover.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.646
I certainly won't.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.915
Did you attend
law school?

06:23.917 --> 06:25.417
I even graduated.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.819
Stanford. Class of 1910.
Valedictorian.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.288
I'm abigail stanton.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.456
Welcome
to coal valley.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.024
A pleasure, mrs. Stanton.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.960
I read all
your correspondence,

06:34.962 --> 06:36.294
And I want to assure you,

06:36.296 --> 06:38.163
And all the widows here,

06:38.165 --> 06:40.298
That, despite the fact
I'm wearing a skirt,

06:40.300 --> 06:41.833
The case for
the mining company

06:41.835 --> 06:43.835
Is in capable hands.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.970
Well, I'd prefer
someone else's hands,

06:44.972 --> 06:46.271
Thank you very much.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.807
Duly noted, but, for now,
it's in mine,

06:48.809 --> 06:51.777
And I'll use a fist,
if need be.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.714
Where can I find
judge parker?

06:55.716 --> 06:57.716
I believe he just checked
into the saloon hotel.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.718
Thank you.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.120
If you'll
excuse me, ladies.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.089
Gentlemen.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.058
Do you think
she stands any chance

07:07.060 --> 07:09.961
Against that pit bull
on gowen's payroll?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.963
Honestly, I think he's
gonna make a fool of her,

07:11.965 --> 07:14.065
And the rest of us.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.868
Glad you could get here
on such short notice, judge.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.204
I was quite surprised to hear

07:19.206 --> 07:21.840
About jedidiah black's
sudden departure.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.074
You didn't have
anything to do

07:23.076 --> 07:24.409
With that, now,
did you, mr. Gowen?

07:24.411 --> 07:26.311
Man got bit
by a rattlesnake.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.479
Yes. In his room.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.314
An unfortunate situation.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.582
[knocking at door]

07:36.522 --> 07:37.923
Judge parker?

07:37.925 --> 07:38.990
That would be me.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.125
I'm samantha madison.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.761
The prosecutor.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.731
Oh. Pleasure to meet you.

07:48.835 --> 07:52.003
This is mr. Gowen
and counselor gentry.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.507
Pleasure.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.008
Ma'am.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.711
Miss madison, have you
ever tried a case before?

07:59.713 --> 08:04.749
I've prosecuted a fair share,
but this will be my first trial.

08:05.852 --> 08:06.918
Hmm.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.086
So how can I help you?

08:08.088 --> 08:10.121
Well, considering
you seem to be

08:10.123 --> 08:11.189
Fraternizing
with the defense...

08:11.191 --> 08:12.624
Not fraternizing.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.793
Defense requested a pre-trial
consultation. That's all.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.295
I see.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.431
Well, I would like to ask
for a continuance

08:19.433 --> 08:21.766
Under the "power of courts act,"
section 173.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.071
Well, I have a poker
game this evening.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.740
And as long as I'm winning,
you can have the weekend.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.075
A week would be better.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.477
As I said--
you have 48 hours.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.013
Trial starts
at 9:00 a.M., sharp.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.916
Well, I will be ready.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.918
Good day,
gentlemen.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.952
Good day.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.824
[â™ª]

08:45.826 --> 08:48.593
Does she have
much trial experience?

08:48.595 --> 08:50.128
How could she?
She's a woman.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.897
Which means she has to
be twice as good

08:51.899 --> 08:54.132
To have made it
this far in a man's world.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.101
Should we try
to get someone else?

08:56.103 --> 08:58.837
She's a prosecutor,
appointed by the state!

08:58.839 --> 09:00.672
Let's be realistic.

09:00.674 --> 09:03.341
The chances of her winning
this trial is slim to none.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.776
You gave me a chance
without knowing me.

09:04.778 --> 09:05.944
Why not give her one?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.812
Well, easy for you to say.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.814
You didn't lose
anybody in that mine.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.784
Florence.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.619
Elizabeth
is on our side.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.187
You're right,
florence, I didn't.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.823
But you entrusted me
with your children,

09:18.825 --> 09:20.525
And I hope I'm teaching them
to judge people

09:20.527 --> 09:21.993
Based on who they are inside--

09:21.995 --> 09:24.462
Not whether they're wearing
pants or a skirt.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.131
What you don't seem
to understand

09:26.133 --> 09:28.600
Is that this madison woman could
lose this trial for all of us!

09:28.602 --> 09:30.101
She could win it, too!

09:30.103 --> 09:32.137
And I plan to.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.705
But I won't lie to you,
ladies.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.173
We have our work
cut out for us.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.275
Did you speak
to judge parker?

09:37.277 --> 09:38.877
I did,

09:38.879 --> 09:40.512
And I convinced him

09:40.514 --> 09:42.781
To give us a continuance
for 48 hours.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.317
I'm surprised...

09:45.319 --> 09:48.286
Since everyone in town knows
he's in mr. Gowen's pocket.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.690
[sighs] we can't dwell
on what we can't change.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.258
I couldn't have
said that better myself.

09:54.460 --> 09:56.027
How can we help?

09:57.530 --> 09:59.864
We need to develop
a winning strategy,

09:59.866 --> 10:02.968
Establish
a solid fact pattern.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.169
What I mean by that

10:04.171 --> 10:06.171
Is I need you to tell me

10:06.173 --> 10:08.306
Every little detail
leading up to the explosion.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.674
Don't leave anything out.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.910
I want to know
everything you remember,

10:11.912 --> 10:14.279
No matter how small.

10:15.715 --> 10:19.217
Well, would you like
some coffee and pie?

10:19.219 --> 10:22.721
[chuckles]
I do my best work over pie.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.290
-[others laugh]
-oh, please. Join us.

10:27.827 --> 10:29.995
[â™ª]

10:32.531 --> 10:34.099
How'd it go?

10:34.101 --> 10:36.735
She likes pie!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.370
She's very capable.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.005
Well, that's good.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.341
Abigail, you might want
to take a piece of that pie

10:43.343 --> 10:44.509
To the judge.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.177
He strikes me
as a man who likes dessert.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.512
Isn't that a bribe?

10:47.514 --> 10:49.714
I'm sure he's seen
bigger bribes than pie.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.416
Oh, he can't be that bad!

10:51.418 --> 10:53.184
He's the nephew
of isaac parker,

10:53.186 --> 10:54.419
The hanging judge.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.621
And the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.390
Well, let's just say

10:58.392 --> 10:59.791
I have heard he has

10:59.793 --> 11:01.826
A unique interpretation
of "justice."

11:03.929 --> 11:07.499
Well, maybe a little dessert
couldn't hurt.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.937
[â™ª]

11:17.209 --> 11:18.543
So, bill...

11:18.545 --> 11:21.312
How long do you figure
to continue this charade?

11:22.481 --> 11:23.715
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.116
Well, I believe you do.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.951
And people will find out
sooner or later.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.287
It's a very small town.

11:33.959 --> 11:35.293
Gentlemen.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.430
Maybe we should
do this another time.

11:38.432 --> 11:40.165
What other time is there?

11:40.167 --> 11:41.966
Abigail,
I wouldn't--

11:45.604 --> 11:46.938
Would you care to join us?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.306
No, your honor.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.641
And may I ask
what you're doing here?

11:49.643 --> 11:51.076
[chuckles]

11:51.078 --> 11:52.811
I believe it's quite clear.

11:52.813 --> 11:53.945
And I'm quite certain
it's illegal

11:53.947 --> 11:55.346
To fraternize
with the defendant.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.115
Well, I think
it's also illegal

11:57.117 --> 11:59.651
For you to break into my office
and steal company property.

11:59.653 --> 12:02.520
You should have them
arrested for burglary.

12:02.522 --> 12:04.622
[judge]:
Calm down, mr. Gowen.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.591
He's just upset
because he's losing.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.159
[laughs]

12:08.161 --> 12:09.828
-You in or out?
-I'm in.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.896
I insist you stop playing.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.201
You know, if you continue
to interrupt this game,

12:16.203 --> 12:18.269
The judge here may find you
in contempt of court.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.804
This isn't a court,
it's a saloon.

12:19.806 --> 12:22.006
It's my court
and, right now, my card game.

12:22.008 --> 12:24.109
Then may I suggest
you take three more cards?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.878
Because you're not gonna win
with a pair of twos.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.218
Constable?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.520
Would you please
escort this woman out?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.789
She's right, judge.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.858
This looks like a clear
violation of the ethics code.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.526
You're hardly
the right man

12:41.528 --> 12:43.495
To speak to ethics, now,
are you, bill?

12:43.497 --> 12:45.864
Especially in front
of mrs. Stanton.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.365
I was talking
to the judge, gowen.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.667
Yeah. You know he's not
the gentleman you think he is?

12:49.669 --> 12:51.069
I don't think you have room

12:51.071 --> 12:53.071
To talk about ethics either,
mr. Gowen.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.973
You know, perhaps you should
teach them both a lesson

12:54.975 --> 12:56.074
And have them
spend the night in jail.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.175
They don't leave,

12:57.177 --> 12:58.576
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

12:59.645 --> 13:02.213
[â™ª]

13:02.215 --> 13:04.549
You have something to say,
young lady?

13:04.551 --> 13:06.985
No one's going
to jail today, judge.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.587
[â™ª]

13:12.892 --> 13:14.959
Have a lovely
afternoon.

13:18.197 --> 13:20.165
[â™ª]

13:21.367 --> 13:24.068
All right.
Deal 'em up.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.338
Oh! I really wanted

13:27.340 --> 13:28.940
To give that man
a piece of my mind.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.909
I suggest we don't
give parker any more reason

13:30.911 --> 13:32.043
To side with gowen.

13:32.045 --> 13:32.911
What he's doing
is unethical!

13:32.913 --> 13:34.879
Abigail.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.181
Is there
something wrong?

13:36.183 --> 13:37.715
You tell me, mr. Avery.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.184
Oh, we're back to "mr. Avery"?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.251
What happened to "bill?"

13:40.253 --> 13:42.153
He's married,
with a child.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.125
[â™ª]

13:49.128 --> 13:51.429
Could I have a moment
alone with you to explain?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.198
I have some work
to do at the jail.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.033
I have some papers
to grade.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.034
Elizabeth,

13:56.036 --> 13:57.602
Please stay.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.636
Whatever you have to say to me,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.438
You can say it
in front of elizabeth.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.773
Are you sure about that?

14:01.775 --> 14:04.008
It's fine, elizabeth.
I have nothing to hide.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.981
You saw the picture
in my room?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.382
And the wedding ring
on your dresser.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.550
I'm not married.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.219
I was.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.788
My son died two years ago.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.390
I lost my wife a week later.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.029
I'm... I'm so sorry.

14:26.265 --> 14:28.633
Now may I have
that moment alone?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.935
I have
customers waiting.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.670
Don't worry
about that, abigail.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.472
I can take care
of the cafe myself.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.608
If you need help at the cafe,
abigail,

14:36.610 --> 14:38.109
I'm more than happy to pitch in.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.244
I'm a wonderful cook.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.345
In fact,

14:40.347 --> 14:42.347
The biscuits
at del monico's

14:42.349 --> 14:43.781
In new york

14:43.783 --> 14:45.083
Are my recipe.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.451
Of course they are!

14:46.453 --> 14:48.820
[â™ª]

14:50.189 --> 14:51.623
Thank you!

14:51.625 --> 14:52.991
I won't be long.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.260
Oh! Take all
the time you need!

14:56.962 --> 14:58.429
I'm so sorry.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.597
I feel terrible

14:59.599 --> 15:01.132
For the thoughts
I've had about you.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.200
Oh, don't!

15:02.202 --> 15:04.202
They're probably
half-true anyway.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.673
The truth is, abigail,

15:08.675 --> 15:10.642
I never thought
I would have feelings

15:10.644 --> 15:11.943
For another woman again.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.878
Until I met you.

15:16.181 --> 15:19.784
So...

15:19.786 --> 15:21.386
Are we all right again?

15:21.388 --> 15:23.388
I suppose we are.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.156
Good.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.624
Well, I guess
I should get back

15:26.626 --> 15:28.726
Before elizabeth
burns down my kitchen.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.599
I don't see any flames.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.568
It has been a while

15:37.570 --> 15:39.437
Since I've taken
the afternoon off.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.374
[â™ª]

15:47.079 --> 15:49.180
Pass me the salt,
will you?

15:49.182 --> 15:52.717
Oh, and flip your steak,
otherwise it's gonna burn.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.487
No, not like that.

15:57.923 --> 15:59.324
I don't recall
signing up

15:59.326 --> 16:00.391
To work for you.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.660
Oh, am I being too bossy?

16:02.662 --> 16:04.195
My apologies.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.263
Thank you.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.565
I just have such
a way with cooking,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.667
And from what I hear,
you, uh...

16:09.669 --> 16:10.868
Don't.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.203
Who told
you that?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.839
Oh, jack may have
mentioned it.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.741
Jack has barely even
tried my cooking.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.376
Hah! Perhaps
there's a reason for that.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.744
[inhales sharply]

16:19.746 --> 16:20.812
Jack...

16:22.047 --> 16:24.749
You know, I'm really
not that hungry after all.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.119
Let's get you a table.

16:29.688 --> 16:31.556
No! Not there. Here.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.291
It's a much better view.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.926
He doesn't need
a view of main street--

16:34.928 --> 16:37.261
He sees it
all day, every day.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.764
I'm just gonna get something
and take it back to the jail.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.099
You'll do
no such thing!

16:41.101 --> 16:42.800
My chicken-fried steak

16:42.802 --> 16:45.136
Will not be eaten
in that dirty jail.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.771
Neither will mine!

16:46.773 --> 16:48.106
You both made
chicken-fried steak?

16:48.108 --> 16:49.273
Well, I did.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.442
I'm not sure elizabeth's
can be identified.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.379
Although, mr. Avery
is a forensic expert.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.813
[fuming sigh]

16:55.815 --> 16:58.483
I'm just gonna take
a coffee, black. Thank you.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.852
And...?

17:02.955 --> 17:05.590
And your chicken-fried steak.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.959
Coming right up.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.727
Honestly, elizabeth...

17:09.729 --> 17:11.329
Don't you think you're
being a bit selfish,

17:11.331 --> 17:13.731
Insisting that
he eat your steak

17:13.733 --> 17:15.767
When you know...

17:15.769 --> 17:17.835
Mine is better?

17:17.837 --> 17:19.570
Well, that's
just your opinion.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.773
[scoffs with delight]

17:21.775 --> 17:23.241
Well...

17:23.243 --> 17:25.176
If it's true what they say,

17:25.178 --> 17:28.513
That the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach,

17:28.515 --> 17:31.249
You could be accused
of attempted murder.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.522
[â™ª]

17:39.458 --> 17:41.659
That is a lot of food.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.761
Well, you work so hard
protecting the town.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.497
Actually, I haven't
done much all day.

17:47.666 --> 17:48.866
Jack...

17:48.868 --> 17:51.335
I know
I'm not the greatest cook.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.470
[scoffs]

17:52.472 --> 17:54.372
I've never cooked

17:54.374 --> 17:55.540
At del monico's,

17:55.542 --> 17:57.308
Or anywhere else,
for that matter,

17:57.310 --> 18:00.311
But I did spend the last hour
cooking over a hot stove,

18:00.313 --> 18:04.549
And we both know,
that if you don't eat this...

18:04.551 --> 18:06.984
No one else will.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.553
Except his dog, rip.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.758
[â™ª]

18:25.537 --> 18:28.172
[forced]: Mm. Mm...

18:28.174 --> 18:30.241
I'll keep this
warm for you.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.347
I'm sorry
for interrupting.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.548
Oh, not a problem, ned.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.651
Miss thatcher,
this telegram came for you,

18:40.653 --> 18:42.954
And I think
it might be important.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.859
It's from my father.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.061
My mother's taken ill.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.829
They want me home
as soon as possible.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.834
[â™ª]

19:01.940 --> 19:05.576
I was barely 18
when I met noah.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.545
So young
to fall in love.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.679
Not much older than

19:08.681 --> 19:10.581
My son, peter,
would've been right now.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.950
Anyway, he asked me
to marry him

19:12.952 --> 19:14.785
The same night
that I met him.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.521
What did you say?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.856
No, of course.

19:18.858 --> 19:19.957
Then somehow,
two weeks later,

19:19.959 --> 19:21.959
We were standing
in front of a preacher!

19:21.961 --> 19:24.328
I guess my "no"
wasn't very convincing.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.265
What about you?

19:27.267 --> 19:29.800
How did you
propose to your wife?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.370
Well, believe it or not,
she proposed to me.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.638
Really?

19:34.940 --> 19:38.109
We had our differences,
but she put up with me.

19:38.111 --> 19:41.145
Well, I guess we were
both lucky in love.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.314
For a little while, anyway.

19:43.316 --> 19:46.984
There's something to be
said for second chances.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.855
[â™ª]

20:10.909 --> 20:12.143
Jack.

20:12.145 --> 20:13.844
Elizabeth.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.947
I'm going with you.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.815
To hamilton?

20:17.817 --> 20:20.585
Yeah, I need to make sure
you get there safely.

20:20.587 --> 20:22.420
Are you sure?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.955
Oh, positive.

20:23.957 --> 20:26.190
Plus, I get a chance to catch up
with my brother,

20:26.192 --> 20:29.760
So don't even think of
giving me an argument.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.330
I wasn't planning on it.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.770
I'm so worried, jack.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.339
Hey...

20:41.341 --> 20:43.708
It's gonna be okay.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.319
Don't worry.
I'll look after things.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.454
And keep
an eye on gowen.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.955
I'll keep
two eyes on him.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.390
You'll be
in my thoughts

20:59.392 --> 21:00.558
And my prayers.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.960
I'll feel better
once I'm there.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.304
Take good care
of her, jack.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.338
I will.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.307
[driver]: Hyah!

21:22.681 --> 21:24.515
Abigail, mr. Avery--

21:24.517 --> 21:27.518
This is
joseph sweeney.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.053
He'll be
testifying for us.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.088
Thank you for coming
all this way, mr. Sweeney.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.691
My conscience wouldn't
allow me to do anything less.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.060
I knew your
husband and son.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.662
They were fine men.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.363
And completely innocent
of all wrongdoing.

21:39.365 --> 21:40.431
I agree.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.033
Unfortunately,

21:42.035 --> 21:43.434
Mr. Sweeney is not
in possession

21:43.436 --> 21:44.835
Of our mine
inspection report.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.838
I've left my job with
the bureau of mines.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.173
Started up
my own business.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.042
Drill presses.

21:51.044 --> 21:52.343
Haven't made
a dime yet,

21:52.345 --> 21:54.111
But these things
take time.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.579
Mr. Sweeney,
you do realize

21:55.581 --> 21:57.315
We're not going to be able
to pay you for your testimony?

21:59.284 --> 22:01.085
Oh. [stammers]

22:01.087 --> 22:03.087
Of course.
[chuckling]

22:03.089 --> 22:04.588
But I can give you
breakfast,

22:04.590 --> 22:06.090
Lunch,
and dinner.

22:06.092 --> 22:07.425
I'm sure you're hungry
after your trip.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.560
Well, I wouldn't
turn down a meal.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.362
Right this way.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.272
As I recall,

22:21.274 --> 22:23.207
Noah contacted
you directly,

22:23.209 --> 22:24.809
Is that right?

22:24.811 --> 22:27.645
Yes. About safety conditions
in the mine.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.046
He was concerned

22:29.048 --> 22:31.148
The ventilation system
wasn't functioning properly.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.616
That's exactly
what noah told me.

22:32.618 --> 22:33.784
Do you remember
what you said

22:33.786 --> 22:34.985
In your
inspection report?

22:34.987 --> 22:37.455
I found the system
to be unsafe,

22:37.457 --> 22:39.290
And I recommended
they suspend operation

22:39.292 --> 22:40.658
Until it was fixed.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.826
And you're prepared

22:41.828 --> 22:43.427
To testify to that
in a court of law?

22:43.429 --> 22:45.329
Even though the report

22:45.331 --> 22:47.331
Gowen has on record
tells a different story?

22:47.333 --> 22:51.135
That report
is a blatant forgery.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.636
I knew it.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.606
I was hoping
to have another witness

22:55.608 --> 22:57.074
To back up
your testimony,

22:57.076 --> 22:58.342
But it didn't
pan out.

22:58.344 --> 23:00.911
So our case will depend on you.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.813
You're all we've got.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.850
It's the truth,

23:05.852 --> 23:08.486
And I'm happy
to testify to it.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.987
Thank you,
mr. Sweeney.

23:09.989 --> 23:13.124
It's past time
my husband was vindicated.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.725
Mm.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.698
[â™ª]

23:26.271 --> 23:27.838
Tell me, elizabeth.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.441
What exactly did you
pack in these?

23:30.443 --> 23:31.675
Just the essentials.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.444
Did the essentials
include an anvil?

23:34.713 --> 23:37.448
I would be more than happy
to carry my own suitcases.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.449
[laughs] really?

23:38.451 --> 23:40.050
Okay.

23:40.052 --> 23:41.952
[thud]

23:43.188 --> 23:45.089
Be my guest.

23:48.460 --> 23:49.593
[grunts]

23:50.862 --> 23:52.563
All right,
you've made your point.

23:53.799 --> 23:55.533
I'm sure
father sent the car.

23:56.735 --> 23:58.969
Elizabeth thatcher!

23:58.971 --> 24:00.905
Regina allen!
How are you?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.573
I'm fine,
but I heard about your mother.

24:02.575 --> 24:04.408
I hope the poor dear
is all right.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.210
That's why I came
as soon as I could.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.712
Regina, this is
constable jack thornton.

24:08.714 --> 24:10.548
-Mm. Charmed.
-Ma'am.

24:10.550 --> 24:11.582
Well, aren't you lucky

24:11.584 --> 24:12.917
To have such
a handsome fellow

24:12.919 --> 24:14.151
To carry your luggage?

24:14.153 --> 24:16.487
Oh, no, he's not here
to carry my luggage--

24:16.489 --> 24:17.488
[whistle blasting]

24:17.490 --> 24:18.923
That's my train!

24:18.925 --> 24:21.325
Mother procured an introduction
with an austrian count.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.660
He has a castle!

24:22.662 --> 24:24.128
With a huge moat.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.598
It's so very good
to see you, <i>ma cherie.</i>

24:27.600 --> 24:29.500
[blowing air kisses]

24:29.502 --> 24:30.534
<i>A bientot.</i>

24:30.536 --> 24:31.902
<i>A bientot.</i>

24:33.238 --> 24:35.272
[engine whistle blows]

24:35.274 --> 24:36.540
A friend of yours?

24:36.542 --> 24:37.775
That'd be
stretching it.

24:37.777 --> 24:38.943
Good, 'cause
she judges a man

24:38.945 --> 24:40.611
By the size of
his moat.

24:40.613 --> 24:42.246
[laughing]

24:42.248 --> 24:45.683
Regina is one of
the philadelphia allens.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.251
Very upper-crust.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.886
Her family's been
around forever.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.421
Like the plague.

24:50.423 --> 24:52.256
Jack!

24:53.692 --> 24:55.359
[horn blares]

24:56.528 --> 24:58.028
There's the car!
Come on, jack.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.264
[grunts]

25:02.467 --> 25:05.035
[â™ª]

25:23.221 --> 25:25.956
[â™ª]

25:32.130 --> 25:34.498
[engine rumbling in distance]

25:35.800 --> 25:37.868
Do you guys hear that?

25:39.004 --> 25:40.371
What is it?

25:42.908 --> 25:44.241
Hey, guys, get over here.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.644
[â™ª]

25:48.780 --> 25:51.482
What is that thing?

26:01.192 --> 26:03.594
[engine roaring]

26:03.596 --> 26:05.863
[townsfolk murmuring]

26:13.471 --> 26:14.705
[engine idling]

26:14.707 --> 26:16.373
Boys.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.742
[revs throttle]

26:28.820 --> 26:30.955
[shuts bike down]

26:33.625 --> 26:36.727
Well, I've never seen
a vehicle like this one.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.861
Well, that's funny.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.163
You're not looking
at the vehicle.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.565
I have excellent
peripheral vision.

26:41.567 --> 26:43.500
[laughs]

26:43.502 --> 26:46.337
And what...
[giggles]

26:46.339 --> 26:47.671
...Do you call it?

26:47.673 --> 26:49.640
It's called
a "motorcycle."

26:49.642 --> 26:50.741
It looks fast.

26:50.743 --> 26:51.742
Well, it is.

26:51.744 --> 26:52.743
And dangerous?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.078
Mm. Can be.

26:54.080 --> 26:57.181
What brings you
to coal valley?

26:57.183 --> 26:58.515
Oh, I don't know.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.651
Little of this,
little of that.

27:00.653 --> 27:02.586
A man of mystery.

27:02.588 --> 27:03.921
Mm.

27:03.923 --> 27:06.757
I like it.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.892
Well, I'll keep that
in mind.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.264
[â™ª]

27:23.842 --> 27:25.909
[engine rumbles off]

27:27.679 --> 27:29.613
[giggles] you're here!

27:29.615 --> 27:31.515
Ahh! Julie!

27:32.684 --> 27:35.119
And jack, dear.
So good to see you.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.353
You, too, julie.

27:36.355 --> 27:37.921
How's mother?
I've been so worried.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.289
She's better today.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.358
But she's still
having fainting spells.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.726
I didn't know.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.295
You might,
if you visited more often.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.497
Viola.

27:47.699 --> 27:50.100
You know I'd come home
more often if I could.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.736
Jack,
this is my sister, viola.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.038
Nice to meet you,
miss thatcher.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.240
So this is the mountie
we've heard so much about?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.075
Oh, he's much
more than that!

27:58.077 --> 28:00.277
Well,
you did kiss!

28:00.279 --> 28:02.780
Julie! I wrote to you
in confidence.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.215
Apparently, it's more
than teaching school

28:05.217 --> 28:06.583
That's keeping you away.

28:06.585 --> 28:08.152
[footsteps]

28:08.154 --> 28:11.155
My three daughters
all together.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.756
[he chuckles]

28:12.758 --> 28:14.158
A sight for sore eyes.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.427
Father.

28:16.429 --> 28:18.762
I'm so happy
to see you.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.731
I hear mother's
doing better?

28:20.733 --> 28:23.033
She'll do much better
now that you're here.

28:25.170 --> 28:29.106
Father, this is jack.
Constable jack thornton.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.908
Good to put a face to the name.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.910
I'm indebted to you
for escorting my daughter home.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.344
Glad to be of service, sir.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.013
Jack, we're having
a dinner party

28:36.015 --> 28:37.081
Tomorrow night,

28:37.083 --> 28:38.449
And you simply
must come.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.317
Julie, don't put
him on the spot.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.619
I'm sure the constable
has other things to do.

28:42.621 --> 28:44.988
I'm sure jack
could spare a few hours.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.858
I-I wouldn't
want to impose.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.827
It's no imposition.

28:50.962 --> 28:52.629
Well...

28:52.631 --> 28:54.531
Then I suppose
it's settled.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.467
Come along, girls.

28:56.469 --> 28:57.434
I'll catch up
in a minute.

29:00.271 --> 29:02.372
Well, at least
it doesn't have a moat.

29:02.374 --> 29:03.474
[laughs]

29:03.476 --> 29:05.175
Doesn't have
a guillotine either!

29:05.177 --> 29:07.444
I'm guessing the rack's
in the basement?

29:07.446 --> 29:09.713
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm?

29:10.849 --> 29:12.216
Why don't I meet you in town?

29:12.218 --> 29:14.351
We can see some
of the city together.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.120
Well, are you sure
you won't be missed?

29:16.122 --> 29:17.621
It's a pretty big house.

29:19.224 --> 29:21.892
[â™ª]

29:30.301 --> 29:32.870
[both chuckle]

29:34.305 --> 29:36.740
[â™ª]

29:39.711 --> 29:42.146
Mother, you have no idea
how worried I've been.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.747
I'll be fine,
darling.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.415
I don't want you
worrying about me.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.317
I want you to have
a good time with your sisters

29:47.319 --> 29:48.318
While you're here.

29:49.854 --> 29:52.189
Well, what does
dr. Clement say?

29:52.191 --> 29:55.425
He says your mother
has a weak heart.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.661
It's important that
nothing upset her right now.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.396
Maybe we should
cancel the dinner party.

29:59.398 --> 30:00.664
Nonsense!

30:00.666 --> 30:02.266
We must celebrate
your return home.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.201
It's just a few old
family friends.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.936
And viola's new beau,

30:05.938 --> 30:07.171
Sir lionel.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.705
Viola!

30:08.707 --> 30:09.873
You didn't tell me!

30:09.875 --> 30:11.508
You didn't ask.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.177
Sir lionel
is from london.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.378
He's a duke.

30:14.380 --> 30:17.614
His uncle
is grand duke andrew gray,

30:17.616 --> 30:18.849
And his great-uncle is an earl.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.918
Darling.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.186
I'm sure you'll want to
shop for something new

30:22.188 --> 30:23.220
To wear to the party.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.721
That won't
be necessary.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.924
This isn't
the wild west, elizabeth.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.526
We do still dress
for dinner here.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.928
Oh, wait until

30:30.930 --> 30:32.763
You see the new gowns
at salon de mode.

30:32.765 --> 30:34.464
The organzas
are pure heaven!

30:35.900 --> 30:38.468
Well, I suppose it might be
nice to have something new.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.571
And perhaps a little fancy.

30:40.573 --> 30:43.006
Oh, good! It'll be
just like old times!

30:45.243 --> 30:48.312
[â™ª]

30:53.451 --> 30:55.285
Mother seems to be
in good spirits.

30:55.287 --> 30:56.653
Because you're here.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.655
But it isn't easy
taking care of her.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.391
Well, I wish I could
be home more often,

31:01.393 --> 31:02.926
But I have school to teach.

31:02.928 --> 31:04.328
Books
and education.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.096
It's a wonderful
way to escape.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.497
It isn't an escape.

31:07.499 --> 31:08.832
I love what I do.

31:08.834 --> 31:09.933
I'm sure you do,

31:09.935 --> 31:11.001
But when I get married,

31:11.003 --> 31:12.169
Who's going
to look after mother?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.503
Well, I will!

31:13.505 --> 31:14.638
You can barely
look after yourself.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.473
And with
father traveling so much,

31:16.475 --> 31:18.141
What will happen
if her condition worsens?

31:18.143 --> 31:19.376
Let's not
think the worst.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.581
Viola can be
so tedious.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.517
Some of what
she said was true.

31:27.519 --> 31:28.585
No, it's not!

31:28.587 --> 31:29.987
Let's be fair.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.256
It is a great deal
of responsibility.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.624
Don't let it
bother you.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.559
She lives
to lord it over us.

31:38.663 --> 31:40.497
Is sir lionel
really serious about her?

31:40.499 --> 31:42.132
Well, he's serious
about her bank account,

31:42.134 --> 31:43.967
And she's in love
with his title.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.369
A match made in heaven.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.337
[both laughing]

31:49.474 --> 31:51.675
[â™ª]

31:53.044 --> 31:55.512
I'm never gonna get used
to waiters wearing tuxedos.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.681
It's called
white-glove service, jack.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.016
At abigail's,
the food is great,

31:59.018 --> 32:00.684
And nobody's
wearing gloves.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.619
At least admit
it was delicious.

32:02.621 --> 32:04.354
Salisbury steak?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.690
It's just a fancy name
for hamburger.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.358
Well, it does
come with a sauce.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.128
Speaking of fancy,

32:11.130 --> 32:13.797
Can you picture rip
with a haircut like that?

32:13.799 --> 32:16.366
Life in a big city does
take some getting used to,

32:16.368 --> 32:18.402
But I got used to
life in coal valley,

32:18.404 --> 32:19.736
And now I'm completely
at home there.

32:19.738 --> 32:20.871
Really?

32:20.873 --> 32:23.073
You still don't know
how to ride a horse.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.242
It's a good thing I have
such a good teacher, then.

32:25.244 --> 32:26.576
I don't know.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.246
You might not be able
to afford him.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.647
Oh?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.382
Could cost you
another kiss.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.255
Consider it
a downpayment.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.231
[â™ª]

32:49.834 --> 32:52.002
[murmuring and shuffling]

32:53.938 --> 32:55.906
[bailiff]: All rise.

33:02.513 --> 33:04.648
Be seated.

33:09.220 --> 33:10.854
[gavel clacking]

33:10.856 --> 33:12.689
Court is in session.

33:13.791 --> 33:14.891
Miss madison,

33:14.893 --> 33:16.893
Your opening
statement.

33:16.895 --> 33:18.128
Your honor,

33:18.130 --> 33:21.031
This tragedy
could have been prevented.

33:21.033 --> 33:22.265
Had it,

33:22.267 --> 33:24.301
The women in this courtroom
would have

33:24.303 --> 33:26.570
Husbands, fathers and sons.

33:26.572 --> 33:29.439
Instead,
they sit here alone,

33:29.441 --> 33:31.908
Hoping for
some small sliver of justice.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.478
I will prove to you today

33:34.480 --> 33:36.313
That the pacific northwest
mining company

33:36.315 --> 33:38.949
Knew that the conditions
in that mine were unsafe.

33:38.951 --> 33:40.617
They knew,

33:40.619 --> 33:43.553
Because noah stanton
warned them.

33:43.555 --> 33:46.223
And they didn't care.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.657
All they cared about

33:47.659 --> 33:50.394
Was removing as much coal
as they could

33:50.396 --> 33:53.196
To make as much money
as they could.

33:56.401 --> 33:57.968
Counsel?

33:59.070 --> 34:00.270
Your honor.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.972
May I first say

34:01.974 --> 34:04.508
That it is my greatest pleasure
to stand here before you

34:04.510 --> 34:05.675
In this courtroom?

34:07.745 --> 34:09.946
[â™ª]

34:09.948 --> 34:12.816
Now, tell me everything
I've missed in coal valley.

34:12.818 --> 34:14.418
Oh, the mining
company is on trial.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.653
We'll get to that later.
I want to know about jack!

34:16.655 --> 34:17.788
You already know
more than you should.

34:17.790 --> 34:18.855
Well, I'm your favorite sister.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.190
You're supposed to
tell me everything.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.825
[elizabeth chuckles]

34:21.827 --> 34:23.326
Well...

34:23.328 --> 34:24.828
When we're together,

34:24.830 --> 34:26.596
It's like everything
in the whole world

34:26.598 --> 34:28.331
Just fades away,

34:28.333 --> 34:29.800
And it's just the two of us.

34:29.802 --> 34:30.767
Well, is it love?

34:30.769 --> 34:32.636
It could be.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.104
Has he said it?

34:34.106 --> 34:35.338
No!

34:35.340 --> 34:36.873
-Have you?
-Of course not!

34:36.875 --> 34:37.974
Oh, it must be
so wonderful

34:37.976 --> 34:39.009
To be in love.

34:39.011 --> 34:40.010
Charles?

34:42.213 --> 34:43.947
Elizabeth.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.683
I must say...

34:46.685 --> 34:48.385
Frontier life
suits you.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.153
It's so wonderful
to see you again.

34:50.155 --> 34:51.188
You as well.

34:51.190 --> 34:52.489
Charles came

34:52.491 --> 34:54.291
To drop off
some paperwork,

34:54.293 --> 34:57.027
But he may have had
an ulterior motive.

34:57.029 --> 34:58.462
[laughs]

34:58.464 --> 35:00.797
Guilty as charged.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.166
I never pass up a chance
to see elizabeth.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.902
I-it's been far too long.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.838
When was the last time
we saw each other?

35:07.840 --> 35:09.339
Well, as I recall,

35:09.341 --> 35:11.675
Since I was your escort
at julie's debutante ball.

35:11.677 --> 35:14.511
No! Was it really
that long ago?

35:14.513 --> 35:16.913
I dare say we have
a great deal to catch up on.

35:18.149 --> 35:21.318
Beginning with how
father managed to corral you

35:21.320 --> 35:22.719
Into working
for him.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.688
I'd hardly say corralled.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.022
He's given me
a wonderful opportunity,

35:26.024 --> 35:27.324
For which I am very grateful.

35:27.326 --> 35:29.226
As am I.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.393
He's been a valuable addition
to the company.

35:30.395 --> 35:31.695
Charles,
I hope you'll be

35:31.697 --> 35:33.163
Joining us for dinner
this evening?

35:33.165 --> 35:34.097
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

35:34.099 --> 35:36.199
Oh, wonderful!

35:36.201 --> 35:38.535
Elizabeth, why don't you take
charles out to the garden?

35:38.537 --> 35:40.036
I know he hasn't
seen it in a long time.

35:40.038 --> 35:43.106
Oh, I'm sure charles isn't
interested in flowers, mother.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.508
On the contrary.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.809
I'm very interested.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.581
All right.

35:56.687 --> 35:59.022
[background chatter]

36:01.125 --> 36:03.460
[â™ª]

36:09.534 --> 36:11.968
Hello, tom.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.770
Jack...

36:13.772 --> 36:17.107
Almost didn't recognize you
without your band uniform on.

36:17.109 --> 36:19.442
I see you haven't lost
that quick wit of yours.

36:20.478 --> 36:21.545
[starts laughing]

36:21.547 --> 36:22.913
[joins in]

36:22.915 --> 36:24.447
Little brother!

36:24.449 --> 36:25.916
I thought you were busy
playing cops-and-robbers

36:25.918 --> 36:27.384
In some mining town out west?

36:27.386 --> 36:28.752
No, I took some time off

36:28.754 --> 36:30.720
To escort elizabeth thatcher
home to visit her family.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.055
Oh! Lucky you.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.291
The thatchers are basically
royalty around here.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.092
They're just people,
like me and you.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.261
Except they're richer
than midas.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.563
I hear even their butler
has a butler.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.597
Very funny.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.665
Let me look at you.

36:43.301 --> 36:45.235
You've grown
since I've seen you.

36:45.237 --> 36:46.770
Maybe the hair on my head.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.305
It's been so long since you seen
me, you forgot what I look like.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.273
Never!

36:50.275 --> 36:52.409
Well, I'm glad you're here.
What are you drinking?

36:52.411 --> 36:53.910
[exhales deeply]

36:53.912 --> 36:55.278
Whiskey.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.913
[claps hands] bartender!

36:56.915 --> 36:58.315
Whiskey for my brother.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.986
So, how did you know
where to find me?

37:04.288 --> 37:05.922
The boys
at the regional office

37:05.924 --> 37:07.524
Told me they've been keeping
an eye on you.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.825
Said you've been giving them
some trouble.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.061
Want to tell me
about it?

37:13.698 --> 37:15.498
Your honor,

37:15.500 --> 37:17.867
This document
from the bureau of mines,

37:17.869 --> 37:20.270
Signed by joseph sweeney,
who is here today,

37:20.272 --> 37:21.938
Proved that the mine
was safe

37:21.940 --> 37:24.040
And the ventilation system
was working.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.777
We believe
it was noah stanton

37:27.779 --> 37:30.313
Who failed to activate
the system on that fateful day.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.715
That document was forged,

37:31.717 --> 37:34.117
Which I'll prove
by calling my first witness.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.519
Mr. Sweeney?

37:36.521 --> 37:38.488
Finally.
The moment of truth.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.357
His personal
testimony's

37:40.359 --> 37:41.691
Gonna carry
a lot more weight

37:41.693 --> 37:43.627
Than that phony
piece of paper.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.397
Mr. Sweeney,

37:47.399 --> 37:50.033
Is it true you performed
an inspection of the mine

37:50.035 --> 37:51.801
At the request of noah stanton,

37:51.803 --> 37:54.704
Who believed the ventilation
system in the mine was faulty?

37:55.706 --> 37:56.706
I did.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.541
I see.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.809
And could you please
tell the court

37:59.811 --> 38:01.645
What that inspection revealed?

38:01.647 --> 38:04.514
I reported
that mr. Stanton was wrong.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.548
[gallery gasping]

38:05.550 --> 38:06.750
The ventilation system

38:06.752 --> 38:08.885
In the area
where the men were working

38:08.887 --> 38:10.053
Was safe.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.454
[gallery murmuring
and gasping]

38:15.826 --> 38:18.094
Permission to treat
the witness as hostile?

38:18.096 --> 38:19.562
Granted.

38:20.998 --> 38:22.365
Mr. Sweeney.

38:22.367 --> 38:24.734
May I remind you
that you are under oath?

38:24.736 --> 38:26.403
And yesterday,
in the presence

38:26.405 --> 38:28.738
Of constable avery
and abigail stanton,

38:28.740 --> 38:30.273
Didn't you say
that the mine was unsafe?

38:30.275 --> 38:32.208
And the document
in the possession

38:32.210 --> 38:35.111
Of the mining company
was a forgery?

38:35.113 --> 38:37.881
I'm sorry...

38:37.883 --> 38:40.617
I-- I couldn't bear to tell
mrs. Stanton the truth,

38:40.619 --> 38:42.352
With all that
she's been through,

38:42.354 --> 38:43.453
I-I couldn't do it.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.921
Your honor,
this man is a liar!

38:44.923 --> 38:46.623
Clearly, he's been
paid off to recant!

38:46.625 --> 38:47.957
[gavel pounding]

38:47.959 --> 38:49.793
-Order in the court.
-Your honor.

38:49.795 --> 38:51.394
This is a clear case
of negligence

38:51.396 --> 38:53.363
On the part of noah stanton,
who simply failed

38:53.365 --> 38:55.298
To activate
the ventilation system.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.766
Objection! That's
complete speculation.

38:56.768 --> 38:58.802
Mr. Gentry's statement
has no foundation,

38:58.804 --> 39:00.403
And I move to have it
stricken from the record.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.638
[crowd agreeing]

39:01.640 --> 39:03.139
Hear, hear!

39:03.141 --> 39:05.241
It's about time
the truth came out!

39:05.243 --> 39:07.043
Order in the court!
[pounding gavel]

39:07.045 --> 39:08.812
Your honor,

39:08.814 --> 39:10.213
I need a recess.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.048
So ordered.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.383
We're adjourned.

39:13.385 --> 39:14.784
-[clack]
-all rise.

39:15.986 --> 39:17.954
[crowd murmuring]

39:20.391 --> 39:22.992
[â™ª]

39:27.798 --> 39:29.399
Don't you dare
get in that stage!

39:29.401 --> 39:31.000
You walk back in there

39:31.002 --> 39:33.436
And you tell them the truth
right now!

39:33.438 --> 39:34.404
Who got to you? Huh?

39:34.406 --> 39:36.106
Gowen? Gentry?

39:36.108 --> 39:37.440
What'd
they promise you?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.342
More than
chicken pot pie.

39:39.344 --> 39:40.944
[horse whinnies]

39:40.946 --> 39:42.312
You won't get away
with this!

39:42.314 --> 39:44.748
I'll have you prosecuted
for perjury!

39:47.451 --> 39:49.386
[huffs and stomps floor]

39:51.989 --> 39:54.991
[gowen]: I know that this has
been hard on mrs. Stanton,

39:54.993 --> 39:57.327
And I sympathize with her.

39:57.329 --> 39:59.996
Now that the truth
is come out,

39:59.998 --> 40:02.699
Well, won't be long before
you boys can get back to work

40:02.701 --> 40:04.000
And start putting money back
in your pockets.

40:10.141 --> 40:12.075
It's beautiful
out here, isn't it?

40:13.344 --> 40:15.645
Well, the view just got
a whole lot better.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.714
You like to take walks
in the woods, do you?

40:17.716 --> 40:18.715
Oh, I do.

40:18.717 --> 40:19.849
You never know

40:19.851 --> 40:21.351
What new things
you might discover.

40:22.453 --> 40:23.520
-Miss leveaux.
-Mm?

40:23.522 --> 40:24.554
Did you follow me?

40:24.556 --> 40:26.289
Of course not!

40:26.291 --> 40:29.159
So it's just
a coincidence

40:29.161 --> 40:31.027
That we happened to run
into each other out here?

40:31.029 --> 40:32.328
Well, I like to
think of it as fate.

40:32.330 --> 40:34.030
I believe
in making my own fate.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.899
Somehow I could
tell that about you.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.867
I thought
I was a man of mystery.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.035
Oh, but I like
solving mysteries.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.870
[laughing]

40:42.973 --> 40:45.642
Well, the trial's
probably resuming soon.

40:45.644 --> 40:46.676
I should be getting back.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.745
I can't help but wonder

40:48.747 --> 40:51.014
Why a stranger would be
interested in that trial.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.182
Just curious.

40:52.184 --> 40:53.516
Curiosity killed the cat.

40:53.518 --> 40:54.918
Well, this cat has nine lives.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.419
[chuckles]

40:56.421 --> 40:58.087
If you'll excuse me.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.559
[â™ª]

41:02.561 --> 41:04.327
Hmm.

41:05.563 --> 41:07.530
Well, I hope
I'm not taking

41:07.532 --> 41:09.432
Too much time away
from your busy day.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.600
Not at all.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.235
In fact, I have
nothing better to do

41:12.237 --> 41:14.237
Than to go home
and contemplate

41:14.239 --> 41:16.072
My lonely
bachelor existence.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.775
[laughs] why don't
I believe that?

41:18.777 --> 41:20.910
[charles]:
Remember when we were young?

41:20.912 --> 41:22.712
We used to play
blind man's bluff

41:22.714 --> 41:24.180
In these gardens.

41:24.182 --> 41:25.515
[elizabeth]: I remember.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.684
You used to cheat.

41:27.686 --> 41:29.519
That was you!

41:29.521 --> 41:31.621
You used to peek
out of that blindfold

41:31.623 --> 41:33.423
So you could tag me.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.024
I wanted to see
where I was going

41:35.026 --> 41:37.460
So I wouldn't run
into a tree.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.595
You always
seemed to know

41:38.597 --> 41:40.296
Exactly where
you were going.

41:40.298 --> 41:43.466
Then... And now.

41:43.468 --> 41:44.968
That may not be true,

41:44.970 --> 41:47.470
But it's kind
of you to say.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.905
Do the people
of coal valley know

41:48.907 --> 41:50.540
How lucky they are
to have you?

41:50.542 --> 41:52.609
I'm lucky to have them.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.378
Your father mentioned

41:55.380 --> 41:56.913
There might
be some business

41:56.915 --> 41:59.082
For the company
in cape fullerton.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.384
I understand that's not
far from where you are.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.822
I'm not sure father
would be comfortable

42:05.824 --> 42:07.924
Visiting coal valley.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.759
We have so few
creature comforts.

42:09.761 --> 42:12.729
I'm sure he'd be happy
to visit you anywhere.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.264
He'd be happier

42:14.266 --> 42:16.466
If I just decided
to come home.

42:16.468 --> 42:18.968
Is that completely
out of the question?

42:23.908 --> 42:26.509
I'm worried
about mother.

42:26.511 --> 42:28.945
But I'm the only
teacher in coal valley,

42:28.947 --> 42:30.480
And they depend on me.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.983
Anything else
keeping you there?

42:35.185 --> 42:38.187
I'd be lying
if I said there wasn't.

42:39.323 --> 42:41.157
I see.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.695
He must be very special
to be worthy of your affection.

42:45.697 --> 42:47.096
[laughs]

42:47.098 --> 42:48.598
He is.

42:52.870 --> 42:54.938
I have to say
I'm disappointed.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.173
Charles, don't be.

42:57.175 --> 43:00.410
You and I have been
friends forever.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.179
I care about you.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.148
Nothing going to change that
for me.

43:05.150 --> 43:07.183
Nor for me.

43:08.852 --> 43:10.353
Good.

43:11.722 --> 43:13.856
[â™ª]

43:21.799 --> 43:24.867
They look
so perfect together.

43:24.869 --> 43:27.170
Don't get ahead of yourself,
darling.

43:27.172 --> 43:30.273
A man can want
what's best for his daughter.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.476
If only it were that easy.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.916
Want me to call dr. Clement?

43:42.820 --> 43:44.687
No, I'm... Ahem.

43:44.689 --> 43:47.523
Just a little light-headed.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.892
[exhaling deeply]

43:49.894 --> 43:51.828
[bailiff]: All rise.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.569
Be seated.

44:02.106 --> 44:03.606
Miss madison,

44:03.608 --> 44:05.708
Do you have, uh,
any other evidence?

44:05.710 --> 44:06.876
Your honor.

44:06.878 --> 44:07.944
In light of the fact

44:07.946 --> 44:10.179
Mr. Sweeney just
perjured himself--

44:10.181 --> 44:11.614
Miss madison.

44:11.616 --> 44:14.050
Do you have
any other evidence to present?

44:14.052 --> 44:16.753
I move for a mistrial.

44:16.755 --> 44:19.255
Overruled.

44:19.257 --> 44:21.391
You're gonna make
your closing statement.

44:21.393 --> 44:23.826
[crowd murmuring]

44:25.362 --> 44:27.930
[â™ª]

44:36.707 --> 44:39.275
Hyah!

44:40.944 --> 44:41.978
Sir!

44:41.980 --> 44:43.279
Hmm. Yes?

44:43.281 --> 44:45.615
Do you know where I could
find a mr. Sam madison?

44:45.617 --> 44:47.450
"miss madison," actually.

44:47.452 --> 44:49.118
Yeah, she's right in here.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.287
You know, I happen to be
heading that way myself.

44:51.289 --> 44:52.588
Why don't I walk you in?

44:52.590 --> 44:54.824
Come on.

44:54.826 --> 44:57.927
Clearly, that safety report
was falsified.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.462
And if you can believe that,

44:59.464 --> 45:01.964
You can draw
only one conclusion.

45:01.966 --> 45:04.067
Noah stanton is innocent.

45:04.069 --> 45:07.236
Innocent of any wrongdoing
in the death of those men.

45:07.238 --> 45:08.771
The fault lies squarely

45:08.773 --> 45:10.073
Upon the shoulders
of pacific mining,

45:10.075 --> 45:11.674
Whose--

45:11.676 --> 45:13.309
[murmuring]

45:13.311 --> 45:15.111
Excuse me, your honor,
pardon the interruption,

45:15.113 --> 45:19.015
But I believe miss madison needs
to speak with this young lady.

45:20.417 --> 45:21.751
[murmuring increases]

45:27.925 --> 45:29.992
I hope I'm not too late.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.527
You're just in time.

45:31.529 --> 45:33.763
Thank god
you decided to come.

45:33.765 --> 45:35.465
Miss madison!

45:35.467 --> 45:37.533
Would you like to tell me

45:37.535 --> 45:40.570
Why exactly you're disturbing
these proceedings?

45:42.706 --> 45:44.173
Do you have
any idea who she is?

45:44.175 --> 45:46.175
No, but samantha
mentioned

45:46.177 --> 45:47.777
She was hoping to have
another witness.

45:47.779 --> 45:48.945
Your honor.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.847
I would like to call
one more witness.

45:50.849 --> 45:52.181
-Objection!
-Overruled.

45:53.717 --> 45:55.051
This better be good.

45:55.053 --> 45:56.853
Your honor,

45:56.855 --> 45:59.622
This woman
can exonerate noah stanton

45:59.624 --> 46:02.158
And prove the mine report was
forged by the mining company.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.893
This is outrageous.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.428
I'll decide
what's outrageous.

46:08.165 --> 46:10.500
All right.

46:10.502 --> 46:12.969
Miss, would you like
to tell the court

46:12.971 --> 46:14.403
Just who are you?

46:16.473 --> 46:17.907
Clara stanton.

46:19.476 --> 46:21.477
Peter stanton's widow.

46:21.479 --> 46:22.812
[crowd gasping]

46:22.814 --> 46:24.046
Oh, my god.

46:25.749 --> 46:27.016
[all murmuring]

46:27.018 --> 46:28.885
Peter never
said anything.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.822
[stunned murmuring continues]

46:32.824 --> 46:34.390
[gavel pounding]

46:35.559 --> 46:37.460
[silence descends on court]

46:38.662 --> 46:40.863
So you were married
to one of the miners

46:40.865 --> 46:42.265
Who died
in the explosion?

46:42.267 --> 46:44.667
Yes, sir.

46:44.669 --> 46:46.803
My husband's name
was peter stanton.

46:48.038 --> 46:49.839
He worked in the mine
for three years.

46:49.841 --> 46:52.341
We were wed two days
before the accident.

46:55.245 --> 46:56.913
Where'd you find
this witness?

46:56.915 --> 47:00.716
Through a public records search
of the men who died in the mine.

47:00.718 --> 47:02.885
I have a marriage record

47:02.887 --> 47:05.121
For peter stanton
and clara weller.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.898
I am impressed, counselor.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.600
And I have
one more document.

47:17.602 --> 47:20.102
This is the original
safety report

47:20.104 --> 47:21.604
Signed by
joseph sweeney himself.

47:23.473 --> 47:25.708
It clearly states
that the mine was unsafe,

47:25.710 --> 47:27.643
Due to a faulty
ventilation system.

47:27.645 --> 47:30.012
[murmurs rising]

47:31.048 --> 47:32.448
Clara.

47:32.450 --> 47:34.483
[samantha crosses the floor]

47:34.485 --> 47:36.319
Where did you find
that document?

47:37.955 --> 47:40.389
Peter didn't trust
the mining company.

47:41.491 --> 47:42.725
He was afraid

47:42.727 --> 47:44.493
They'd blame his father
for making trouble,

47:44.495 --> 47:47.096
So he gave it to me
for safekeeping...

47:47.098 --> 47:48.397
[stifles a sob]

47:48.399 --> 47:50.299
In case anything happened.

47:52.336 --> 47:54.570
And where did peter
get that report?

47:54.572 --> 47:56.906
It was his father's copy.

47:56.908 --> 48:00.676
Mr. Stanton was afraid that
someone might try to hurt him...

48:00.678 --> 48:04.080
Seeing as he was causing trouble
for the company.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.448
So he gave it to peter.

48:05.450 --> 48:06.682
This is hearsay, your honor.

48:06.684 --> 48:08.084
We can't allow this.

48:08.086 --> 48:09.452
I can allow

48:09.454 --> 48:11.954
Whatever I want.

48:11.956 --> 48:16.492
And right now, what I want
is to study these documents.

48:16.494 --> 48:18.294
Court is adjourned.

48:18.296 --> 48:20.730
[excited chatter]

48:22.432 --> 48:24.300
[â™ª]

48:24.302 --> 48:25.434
Thank you.

48:29.206 --> 48:31.107
[sighs]

48:32.376 --> 48:33.809
Clara...

48:33.811 --> 48:35.878
I'm abigail stanton.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.313
I'm peter's mother.

48:37.315 --> 48:38.614
[sobbing]

48:38.616 --> 48:40.683
[â™ª]

48:45.555 --> 48:48.090
[â™ª]

48:50.027 --> 48:51.627
Why didn't you see that coming?

48:51.629 --> 48:53.896
The woman wasn't on
the witness list.

48:53.898 --> 48:56.332
Well, then how the hell
can he allow her to testify?

48:56.334 --> 48:58.200
Parker plays
fast and loose.

48:58.202 --> 48:59.302
You never know
what he's going to do.

48:59.304 --> 49:01.170
I told you that we should've
stuck with black.

49:01.172 --> 49:03.139
Yeah, well, there's nothing
we can do about that now,

49:03.141 --> 49:04.840
So how are we going
to get out of this?

49:04.842 --> 49:06.809
There may be a way

49:06.811 --> 49:09.512
To persuade parker
that the girl is lying,

49:09.514 --> 49:11.480
But it's going to
be expensive.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.582
Do whatever it takes.

49:15.519 --> 49:17.186
[bicycle bell dings]

49:17.188 --> 49:19.221
[â™ª]

49:25.095 --> 49:26.562
Well, do you think
I picked the right one?

49:26.564 --> 49:28.030
Oh, jack will love it.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.332
I think
it's beautiful.

49:29.334 --> 49:31.367
That sounded
like a compliment.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.202
I know I'm hard on you.

49:33.204 --> 49:36.839
I suppose sometimes I wish
I were as free as you are.

49:36.841 --> 49:37.907
Well, why can't you be?

49:37.909 --> 49:40.343
This is my world, elizabeth.

49:40.345 --> 49:42.712
I'm not sure
I'd fit in anywhere smaller.

49:42.714 --> 49:44.380
Ooh!

49:44.382 --> 49:45.715
What do you think
of this one?

49:45.717 --> 49:48.718
Maybe for a saloon wench
with questionable morals.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.286
Well, then maybe you should
try it on, viola.

49:50.288 --> 49:51.721
Don't be ridiculous.

49:51.723 --> 49:53.456
-[laughing]
-thank you.

49:53.458 --> 49:54.724
I think it would be perfect

49:54.726 --> 49:56.759
For your next dinner
with sir lionel.

49:56.761 --> 49:58.594
Ooh!

49:59.763 --> 50:01.397
So I got into a fight.

50:01.399 --> 50:04.133
It's no big deal.
I'm doing just fine!

50:04.135 --> 50:06.435
I wouldn't call getting
tossed in jail "just fine."

50:06.437 --> 50:07.603
The constables are
so bored around here

50:07.605 --> 50:09.705
They gotta make up
reasons to arrest people.

50:09.707 --> 50:11.273
Only they didn't
in your case, did they?

50:11.275 --> 50:12.441
I'm sorry I'm not

50:12.443 --> 50:14.210
The upstanding defender
of the law you are.

50:14.212 --> 50:16.445
When we were growing up,
you never got into trouble.

50:16.447 --> 50:18.047
Never!
Now you're going,

50:18.049 --> 50:20.082
Looking for it?
What happened?

50:20.084 --> 50:22.251
I don't know, jack.

50:22.253 --> 50:24.387
Maybe life happened.

50:24.389 --> 50:25.621
Hey, can I get

50:25.623 --> 50:26.655
Another of
these, sweetheart?

50:26.657 --> 50:27.890
You know what?
I think he's had enough.

50:27.892 --> 50:29.225
Really, jack?

50:29.227 --> 50:31.394
Big brother's gonna tell me
when I've had enough?

50:31.396 --> 50:32.595
Hey, thornton!

50:32.597 --> 50:33.629
Where's my money?

50:33.631 --> 50:34.830
[thumps glass down]

50:34.832 --> 50:36.665
Spent it on your girlfriend.

50:36.667 --> 50:38.567
You want to settle this
the easy way,

50:38.569 --> 50:40.236
Or the hard way?

50:40.238 --> 50:42.138
Easy way
sounds good to me.

50:42.140 --> 50:43.272
How much?

50:43.274 --> 50:44.473
10 bucks.

50:44.475 --> 50:45.808
Put your money away.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.477
I'm gonna pay you
when I'm good and ready.

50:49.813 --> 50:51.680
[crashing]

50:51.682 --> 50:52.748
Hoo!

50:56.186 --> 50:58.954
Okay. Okay--

50:58.956 --> 51:00.689
Ooh! Do you know
what elizabeth needs?

51:00.691 --> 51:01.824
Hair jewels!

51:01.826 --> 51:03.459
Don't you think
that's a bit much?

51:03.461 --> 51:05.327
But I will admit,

51:05.329 --> 51:07.696
I've have been
missing afternoon tea.

51:07.698 --> 51:09.198
[door swings open]
[ladies gasp]

51:09.200 --> 51:11.200
[thudding]

51:13.003 --> 51:14.603
Jack?

51:14.605 --> 51:15.838
Elizabeth.

51:15.840 --> 51:19.208
We were just...
Having a bite to eat.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.010
Apparently, you like
to eat and run.

51:21.012 --> 51:23.345
Or roll,
as the case may be.

51:23.347 --> 51:25.448
That was just
a misunderstanding.

51:25.450 --> 51:26.949
And who's this?

51:26.951 --> 51:28.951
Tom thornton.
At your service.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.386
I apologize for my brother's
bad behavior here

51:30.388 --> 51:32.221
But trouble seems
to find him.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.624
This is your brother?

51:35.626 --> 51:37.893
His much better-looking
and younger brother.

51:37.895 --> 51:39.562
Tom.

51:39.564 --> 51:41.163
These are
the thatcher sisters.

51:41.165 --> 51:43.699
Miss thatcher,
miss thatcher...

51:43.701 --> 51:45.000
And you must be...

51:45.002 --> 51:46.469
Miss thatcher?

51:46.471 --> 51:49.305
Jack, how could you keep
this charming man a secret?

51:49.307 --> 51:50.973
I'm the black sheep
of the thornton family.

51:50.975 --> 51:52.174
Right, jack?

51:52.176 --> 51:53.742
Well, I, for one,

51:53.744 --> 51:56.245
Find black sheep
quite fascinating.

51:56.247 --> 51:58.013
As interesting
as this all is,

51:58.015 --> 51:59.515
We must be going.

51:59.517 --> 52:00.683
I'll see you this evening?

52:00.685 --> 52:02.318
I'm looking forward to it.

52:03.820 --> 52:06.222
[â™ª]

52:06.224 --> 52:07.523
And these are
the type of people

52:07.525 --> 52:09.158
You want to invite
into our family?

52:09.160 --> 52:10.226
He said it was
a misunderstanding.

52:10.228 --> 52:12.428
So was
the war of 1812.

52:12.430 --> 52:15.598
[â™ª]

52:18.101 --> 52:19.768
[knocking]

52:19.770 --> 52:21.837
Yes?

52:21.839 --> 52:23.772
[door opening]

52:25.208 --> 52:27.176
May I come in?

52:28.245 --> 52:29.311
What for?

52:30.947 --> 52:32.915
[â™ª]

52:56.273 --> 52:57.806
That's a lot of money.

52:59.442 --> 53:00.876
I'm sure you're aware

53:00.878 --> 53:03.312
That bribing a judge
is a federal offense.

53:05.081 --> 53:06.916
Consider it, uh...

53:06.918 --> 53:08.751
Poker winnings.

53:08.753 --> 53:11.086
Of future games

53:11.088 --> 53:13.956
That may,
or may not, occur.

53:15.058 --> 53:16.592
Clever, mr. Gentry.

53:16.594 --> 53:19.361
Very clever.

53:23.333 --> 53:25.434
[â™ª]

53:25.436 --> 53:28.170
We met last year,

53:28.172 --> 53:30.406
When peter
was in cape fullerton

53:30.408 --> 53:32.274
On mining business.

53:32.276 --> 53:35.110
We would see each other
every time he came for supplies.

53:35.112 --> 53:36.245
[chuckles]

53:36.247 --> 53:37.513
I wondered why

53:37.515 --> 53:39.248
He always volunteered
to go to cape fullerton.

53:39.250 --> 53:41.283
Peter was the first boy
I ever knew

53:41.285 --> 53:42.251
Who made me feel special.

53:43.420 --> 53:45.487
He was generous, too.

53:45.489 --> 53:47.289
I knew he didn't
have much money,

53:47.291 --> 53:48.424
But every time he came,

53:48.426 --> 53:49.658
He would bring me flowers.

53:49.660 --> 53:52.194
That sounds
exactly like peter.

53:54.197 --> 53:55.998
I don't know why
didn't he tell me about you.

53:57.667 --> 53:59.201
He was afraid
that you would think

53:59.203 --> 54:00.669
We were too young
to be engaged.

54:00.671 --> 54:03.539
So we kept it
to ourselves, but...

54:04.674 --> 54:06.108
The day after
we were married,

54:06.110 --> 54:08.277
We knew it wasn't right
to keep it a secret anymore.

54:08.279 --> 54:10.546
We planned to come here
to tell you together,

54:10.548 --> 54:12.047
But...

54:12.049 --> 54:14.717
I couldn't get away
from work just then,

54:14.719 --> 54:17.786
And as soon as
peter got back here...

54:21.458 --> 54:23.892
[sighs]

54:23.894 --> 54:25.561
I wish I had known.

54:25.563 --> 54:28.497
I am sorry
if I have caused you any pain.

54:28.499 --> 54:31.300
I know that you have been
through so much already.

54:31.302 --> 54:32.534
No. No, it's fine.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.536
I wanted to meet you.

54:35.639 --> 54:38.040
I really did,

54:38.042 --> 54:40.709
But I wasn't sure
how you'd feel about it.

54:41.811 --> 54:43.512
That's why...

54:43.514 --> 54:45.180
When miss madison
wrote to me

54:45.182 --> 54:47.149
And asked me
to speak at the trial,

54:47.151 --> 54:48.584
I said I wouldn't come.

54:49.719 --> 54:51.487
What made you
change your mind?

54:53.156 --> 54:55.157
I prayed for guidance...

54:58.194 --> 55:00.763
And then I saw
a newspaper in hamilton.

55:00.765 --> 55:03.399
The trial
was front-page news.

55:04.768 --> 55:06.535
I know
that it might sound silly,

55:06.537 --> 55:08.270
But I felt that
that was a sign

55:08.272 --> 55:10.339
That I had to come,

55:10.341 --> 55:11.774
That I had to
do the right thing.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.944
Are you living
back with your parents now?

55:17.013 --> 55:19.014
No.

55:19.016 --> 55:21.150
My parents are
no longer alive.

55:22.886 --> 55:25.387
I'm working
in hamilton now.

55:25.389 --> 55:27.289
And you're happy?

55:28.758 --> 55:31.694
I am happy that
I can take care of myself,

55:31.696 --> 55:33.329
If that's what you mean.

55:36.566 --> 55:38.434
I just remembered.

55:39.903 --> 55:42.471
I have something
I want to show you.

55:50.447 --> 55:51.447
Oh!

55:53.383 --> 55:55.984
Our wedding.

55:55.986 --> 55:58.821
It's the only picture
I have left of him.

56:03.393 --> 56:04.827
I would like you
to have it.

56:11.468 --> 56:14.403
I know that peter would've
wanted you to, mrs. Stanton.

56:19.075 --> 56:21.577
You know,
you're "mrs. Stanton" now, too.

56:23.113 --> 56:24.713
I like the sound of that.

56:27.851 --> 56:29.818
[â™ª]

56:29.820 --> 56:31.153
Thank you.

56:31.155 --> 56:33.155
All rise!

56:35.258 --> 56:36.358
This should
be over soon.

56:36.360 --> 56:37.359
Be seated.

56:45.602 --> 56:47.302
There are two reports,

56:47.304 --> 56:51.840
Which means that one is real
and the other is a forgery.

56:53.009 --> 56:55.277
One is provided
by the mining company,

56:55.279 --> 56:59.448
An enterprise
with everything to lose,

56:59.450 --> 57:01.517
The other by a young lady

57:01.519 --> 57:03.519
Who has nothing to gain
by lying.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.654
You'd better do something.

57:05.656 --> 57:07.389
Your honor, I--

57:07.391 --> 57:08.957
Object to this unfair
characterization of---

57:08.959 --> 57:10.492
Overruled.

57:10.494 --> 57:12.428
Sit down, counselor.

57:14.364 --> 57:16.965
Therefore, in light
of the evidence before me,

57:16.967 --> 57:21.136
I find the pacific northwest
mining company

57:21.138 --> 57:23.806
Guilty of
falsifying safety reports...

57:23.808 --> 57:25.674
[excited murmuring]

57:25.676 --> 57:27.476
...Causing 47 men

57:27.478 --> 57:29.645
To walk into that mine

57:29.647 --> 57:31.380
And straight to their deaths.

57:33.983 --> 57:37.252
The company will be fined
to the maximum amount permitted,

57:37.254 --> 57:38.387
And that money

57:38.389 --> 57:41.190
Will be divided evenly
among the widows.

57:41.192 --> 57:42.591
[gasping and exclaiming]

57:42.593 --> 57:44.493
[applause erupts]

57:45.528 --> 57:47.729
Furthermore...

57:47.731 --> 57:50.332
The mine will be shut down
immediately...

57:50.334 --> 57:53.101
And permanently.

57:53.103 --> 57:55.137
I'd like to throw the book
at you, mr. Gowen.

57:56.339 --> 57:58.106
As your honor is aware,

57:58.108 --> 57:59.942
I, like the miners,

57:59.944 --> 58:01.777
Am an employee
of the company,

58:01.779 --> 58:03.879
Not an owner.

58:03.881 --> 58:07.049
And had no knowledge
of their wrongdoings...

58:07.051 --> 58:09.117
Which I find abhorrent.

58:09.119 --> 58:10.419
You're lying.

58:10.421 --> 58:13.388
But luckily for you,
I can't prove it.

58:13.390 --> 58:15.958
This court
has rendered its verdict.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.259
[clack]

58:17.261 --> 58:19.962
[light applause resumes
and chatter builds]

58:21.464 --> 58:23.365
Well, it's true
what they say,

58:23.367 --> 58:26.134
To make it in a man's world,
you have to be twice as good.

58:26.136 --> 58:27.236
And you are.

58:27.238 --> 58:29.137
Thank you.

58:29.139 --> 58:30.906
I know it must've
been a shock

58:30.908 --> 58:32.541
Finding out about
clara this way,

58:32.543 --> 58:34.877
But I didn't feel
I could tell you earlier,

58:34.879 --> 58:36.712
In case
she didn't show up.

58:36.714 --> 58:38.614
I understand.

58:39.816 --> 58:42.317
And clara, thank you
so much for coming.

58:42.319 --> 58:44.152
You made all the difference.

58:44.154 --> 58:46.121
I was glad
to be a part of it.

58:47.891 --> 58:50.292
[â™ª]

58:54.898 --> 58:57.566
[â™ª]

59:00.403 --> 59:01.737
How was shopping?

59:01.739 --> 59:04.072
I think we went
to every store in town.

59:04.074 --> 59:05.507
Enough about us.
How are you feeling?

59:05.509 --> 59:08.243
Ahh. Sometimes, I feel as if
I could go dancing,

59:08.245 --> 59:09.578
And other times, I feel like

59:09.580 --> 59:11.780
I couldn't walk
from here to the parlor.

59:11.782 --> 59:14.950
But let's speak
of happier things.

59:14.952 --> 59:17.352
Your father said that charles
couldn't stop going on about you

59:17.354 --> 59:18.453
At the office.

59:18.455 --> 59:20.188
I'm sure that's
an exaggeration.

59:20.190 --> 59:22.190
I believe it.
Charles has barely

59:22.192 --> 59:24.326
Accepted a single
social invitation

59:24.328 --> 59:25.761
Since you left town.

59:25.763 --> 59:27.362
That's ridiculous.
We're just friends.

59:27.364 --> 59:29.998
Well, I saw the way he was
gazing at you in the garden.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.333
You were watching us?

59:32.435 --> 59:34.202
No! Of course not, dear.

59:34.204 --> 59:36.505
No, we just-- we happened
to walk by the window.

59:36.507 --> 59:38.507
I wish charles
would give up on you

59:38.509 --> 59:39.775
And look at me
for a change.

59:39.777 --> 59:41.710
You've forgotten
about tom already?

59:41.712 --> 59:42.844
Who?

59:42.846 --> 59:45.047
No one
in particular.

59:45.049 --> 59:46.648
Shall we show you
our new gowns?

59:46.650 --> 59:48.016
Oh, that would be lovely.

59:48.018 --> 59:50.018
Come on.

59:51.321 --> 59:53.689
[quiet chatter]

59:57.293 --> 59:59.461
[â™ª]

1:00:06.369 --> 1:00:07.869
Samantha?

1:00:07.871 --> 1:00:09.004
Tell me.

1:00:09.006 --> 1:00:10.706
What's it like,
being a lawyer?

1:00:10.708 --> 1:00:12.474
Exhilarating
when you win,

1:00:12.476 --> 1:00:15.510
And less so
other times.

1:00:15.512 --> 1:00:17.579
I loved being
a wife and mother,

1:00:17.581 --> 1:00:19.381
I never thought about
doing anything else.

1:00:19.383 --> 1:00:21.516
Well, until the cafe.

1:00:21.518 --> 1:00:23.518
I think there's
nothing more noble

1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:25.587
Than being a wife
and a mother.

1:00:25.589 --> 1:00:29.024
It was my mother
who told me I could--

1:00:29.026 --> 1:00:31.326
I could do anything
I set my mind to.

1:00:31.328 --> 1:00:32.995
And you did.

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:35.497
[laughs]
I'd say so did you.

1:00:35.499 --> 1:00:36.565
[door bangs]

1:00:36.567 --> 1:00:39.067
[conversations quieten]

1:00:39.069 --> 1:00:41.603
I don't know
what you're all celebrating!

1:00:41.605 --> 1:00:43.505
Without the mine,
there's no work.

1:00:43.507 --> 1:00:45.707
People will move away.

1:00:45.709 --> 1:00:47.242
This will become a ghost town.

1:00:50.046 --> 1:00:51.513
We've been through
hard times

1:00:51.515 --> 1:00:53.081
Before, florence.

1:00:53.083 --> 1:00:54.249
We'll weather them again.

1:00:54.251 --> 1:00:55.550
Oh, I don't know how.

1:00:55.552 --> 1:00:57.519
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

1:01:01.958 --> 1:01:04.960
Clara, why don't you
stay in coal valley?

1:01:04.962 --> 1:01:06.595
I wouldn't
want to impose.

1:01:06.597 --> 1:01:07.696
It's not an imposition.

1:01:07.698 --> 1:01:09.031
I have an extra room
upstairs.

1:01:09.033 --> 1:01:11.767
That's really very kind,
but I couldn't.

1:01:11.769 --> 1:01:12.968
You could
work at the cafe.

1:01:12.970 --> 1:01:15.070
I have to get back
to hamilton.

1:01:15.072 --> 1:01:17.205
Is everything okay?

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:20.008
I just need to get
back, that's all.

1:01:21.744 --> 1:01:24.713
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

1:01:26.416 --> 1:01:28.483
I promise I'll write.

1:01:28.485 --> 1:01:29.818
I hope you do.

1:01:31.921 --> 1:01:33.955
[door opens and shuts]

1:01:36.592 --> 1:01:38.927
Mrs. Stanton?

1:01:38.929 --> 1:01:40.929
I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

1:01:40.931 --> 1:01:42.898
So I'd like to
make it up to you.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.735
This... Is for
the widow's fund.

1:01:48.404 --> 1:01:50.839
Oh, my!

1:01:50.841 --> 1:01:52.841
But if you tell anyone
that I gave it to you,

1:01:52.843 --> 1:01:54.476
I'll call you a liar.

1:01:54.478 --> 1:01:56.411
Well, your secret
is safe with me.

1:01:57.513 --> 1:01:58.513
And thank you.

1:02:01.584 --> 1:02:03.985
[â™ª]

1:02:07.423 --> 1:02:08.523
[door bangs shut]

1:02:08.525 --> 1:02:10.492
Hi.

1:02:10.494 --> 1:02:11.693
Ahem.

1:02:11.695 --> 1:02:13.195
Um, folks?

1:02:13.197 --> 1:02:15.197
Can I have your ear
for a moment?

1:02:15.199 --> 1:02:16.865
Um...
[conversations hush]

1:02:16.867 --> 1:02:20.502
My name is leland coulter,
my friends call me "lee,"

1:02:20.504 --> 1:02:23.038
And I, uh, came to coal valley

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:24.673
To see how
your trial turned out.

1:02:24.675 --> 1:02:26.708
And you know, I think
it turned out pretty darn good.

1:02:26.710 --> 1:02:28.877
And now that the mine
is closed...

1:02:28.879 --> 1:02:31.780
The future of this town,
the future of your town,

1:02:31.782 --> 1:02:33.648
Is timber.

1:02:33.650 --> 1:02:36.451
And the good news is...

1:02:36.453 --> 1:02:38.220
That it's everywhere.

1:02:38.222 --> 1:02:41.189
So I have decided

1:02:41.191 --> 1:02:44.025
To build a saw mill,
right here in coal valley,

1:02:44.027 --> 1:02:46.795
And I plan to hire lots of men
to help me build it and run it.

1:02:46.797 --> 1:02:48.196
[gasping and applauding]

1:02:48.198 --> 1:02:49.397
Okay.

1:02:49.399 --> 1:02:50.966
Okay, okay.

1:02:50.968 --> 1:02:52.801
Thank you, thank you.

1:02:52.803 --> 1:02:55.003
So, um,
if someone could just show me

1:02:55.005 --> 1:02:56.004
Where I might set up shop,

1:02:56.006 --> 1:02:57.639
I'll get the ball rolling.

1:02:57.641 --> 1:03:00.642
Oh, I would love to give you
a guided tour

1:03:00.644 --> 1:03:02.644
Of our little hamlet.

1:03:02.646 --> 1:03:04.212
I hoped
you would volunteer.

1:03:04.214 --> 1:03:06.014
Shall we pick up
where we left off?

1:03:06.016 --> 1:03:06.648
I think we should.

1:03:09.986 --> 1:03:12.053
[â™ª]

1:03:14.757 --> 1:03:16.358
You know...

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:18.994
You strike me
as a city gal.

1:03:18.996 --> 1:03:20.362
Oh! [laughs]

1:03:20.364 --> 1:03:21.730
I've learned to adapt.

1:03:21.732 --> 1:03:22.998
[chuckling]

1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:24.332
So, what do you think?

1:03:24.334 --> 1:03:25.834
Is there any vacancy
for me here on main street?

1:03:25.836 --> 1:03:27.602
Well, the mining company

1:03:27.604 --> 1:03:29.237
Won't be needing
their office anymore.

1:03:29.239 --> 1:03:31.540
Ah, I don't know.

1:03:31.542 --> 1:03:33.108
It's not really the image
I want to convey.

1:03:33.110 --> 1:03:36.578
Well, there are
a few other places, but...

1:03:37.713 --> 1:03:40.182
They're a bit too far
to walk from here.

1:03:40.184 --> 1:03:42.284
[chuckling]

1:03:42.286 --> 1:03:44.419
Something tells me
you want to go for a ride.

1:03:44.421 --> 1:03:46.454
Oh! I thought
you'd never ask!

1:03:46.456 --> 1:03:48.223
Okay.

1:03:48.225 --> 1:03:49.858
All right.

1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:51.293
Hold on tight.

1:03:51.295 --> 1:03:52.527
Oh, I will!

1:03:52.529 --> 1:03:54.296
-Okay.
-Ahh!

1:03:58.100 --> 1:03:59.768
If you ever
need anything,

1:03:59.770 --> 1:04:01.136
You know
where to find me,

1:04:01.138 --> 1:04:02.904
And please,
don't forget to write.

1:04:02.906 --> 1:04:04.906
I promise.

1:04:04.908 --> 1:04:06.141
[sighs heavily]

1:04:06.143 --> 1:04:08.410
No one has ever really cared
about me before.

1:04:08.412 --> 1:04:10.645
Except peter.

1:04:10.647 --> 1:04:12.514
And now you.

1:04:14.617 --> 1:04:16.618
You are the kindest woman
I know.

1:04:18.988 --> 1:04:20.989
Safe travels, mrs. Stanton.

1:04:20.991 --> 1:04:23.225
Thank you...

1:04:23.227 --> 1:04:24.292
Mrs. Stanton.

1:04:26.929 --> 1:04:29.598
[â™ª]

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:30.599
I'll write.

1:04:30.601 --> 1:04:32.200
Good luck.

1:04:40.843 --> 1:04:43.511
[â™ª]

1:04:43.513 --> 1:04:45.347
[whip cracks]
hyah!

1:04:45.349 --> 1:04:47.549
Bye.

1:04:58.427 --> 1:04:59.427
You all right?

1:04:59.429 --> 1:05:01.630
I'll be fine.

1:05:01.632 --> 1:05:02.697
After all this,

1:05:02.699 --> 1:05:05.533
I feel like I can finally
put noah to rest.

1:05:05.535 --> 1:05:08.036
Life goes on...

1:05:08.038 --> 1:05:10.071
And I'm ready
to move on, too.

1:05:11.374 --> 1:05:13.942
Well, I'm...
I'm glad to hear that.

1:05:15.678 --> 1:05:19.314
Feels like this town
has new life, doesn't it?

1:05:19.316 --> 1:05:21.182
And that saw mill is just
the start of a lot of things

1:05:21.184 --> 1:05:22.851
That are gonna help
put this place on the map.

1:05:22.853 --> 1:05:25.487
Sounds like
you're thinking about staying.

1:05:25.489 --> 1:05:27.289
Actually, I am.

1:05:27.291 --> 1:05:29.224
I'd like that.

1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.694
[â™ª]

1:05:40.503 --> 1:05:43.204
[â™ª]

1:05:45.308 --> 1:05:46.808
[jack]: Thank you.

1:05:48.177 --> 1:05:49.744
Mrs. Thatcher?

1:05:49.746 --> 1:05:51.379
Yes.

1:05:51.381 --> 1:05:53.481
Thank you
for having me to your home.

1:05:53.483 --> 1:05:55.216
Oh. Well, we are
most appreciative of you

1:05:55.218 --> 1:05:57.052
For escorting elizabeth
back to hamilton.

1:05:57.054 --> 1:05:58.553
That was my pleasure.

1:05:58.555 --> 1:05:59.921
These are for you.

1:05:59.923 --> 1:06:01.923
Well, lovely.

1:06:01.925 --> 1:06:03.591
Would you find
a place for these?

1:06:03.593 --> 1:06:04.893
Thank you.

1:06:04.895 --> 1:06:06.728
I was happy to hear
you're feeling better.

1:06:06.730 --> 1:06:07.996
Oh, well,
that's very kind of you.

1:06:07.998 --> 1:06:09.531
William?

1:06:09.533 --> 1:06:12.167
Who is the man
in the suit?

1:06:12.169 --> 1:06:14.069
[â™ª]

1:06:14.071 --> 1:06:15.904
[william]: Elizabeth's
mountie friend.

1:06:15.906 --> 1:06:18.440
Will the mountie be
joining us for dinner?

1:06:18.442 --> 1:06:20.275
Elizabeth insisted.

1:06:20.277 --> 1:06:21.676
Mm. I see.

1:06:21.678 --> 1:06:24.346
Will he be
bringing his horse?

1:06:26.282 --> 1:06:27.515
[chuckles]

1:06:27.517 --> 1:06:28.917
I have

1:06:28.919 --> 1:06:30.385
-You have?
-Yes. Not for a while, but--

1:06:30.387 --> 1:06:32.020
I'm happy to be back.

1:06:32.022 --> 1:06:33.455
Excuse me.
Charles.

1:06:33.457 --> 1:06:34.622
Welcome.

1:06:34.624 --> 1:06:36.891
Good evening.

1:06:36.893 --> 1:06:38.059
These are for you,

1:06:38.061 --> 1:06:40.428
Grace, the prettiest
flower in the room.

1:06:40.430 --> 1:06:43.098
Oh, well,
that's just because

1:06:43.100 --> 1:06:45.000
My daughters
have yet to join us.

1:06:46.068 --> 1:06:48.269
[â™ª]

1:06:49.572 --> 1:06:52.273
But I fear I'm about
to be upstaged.

1:06:53.376 --> 1:06:55.643
[â™ª]

1:07:08.324 --> 1:07:09.657
You look...

1:07:09.659 --> 1:07:12.160
Absolutely breathtaking,
elizabeth.

1:07:12.162 --> 1:07:14.129
Thank you, charles.

1:07:14.131 --> 1:07:16.398
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

1:07:21.337 --> 1:07:23.271
Have you two met?

1:07:23.273 --> 1:07:25.940
Uh, charles kensington.
I work for elizabeth's father.

1:07:25.942 --> 1:07:27.175
Jack thornton.

1:07:27.177 --> 1:07:29.611
Jack is the constable
of coal valley.

1:07:29.613 --> 1:07:31.346
Oh! Which reminds me.

1:07:31.348 --> 1:07:33.181
I received a telegram.
Good news.

1:07:33.183 --> 1:07:34.516
The trial is over,

1:07:34.518 --> 1:07:35.850
And the judge ruled
in favor of the widows.

1:07:37.086 --> 1:07:39.320
That's not just good news!
That's wonderful news!

1:07:39.322 --> 1:07:40.655
Yes.

1:07:40.657 --> 1:07:42.390
Elizabeth, come and say
hello to your aunt agatha.

1:07:43.492 --> 1:07:45.527
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1:07:52.868 --> 1:07:56.204
[jack]: So how long have you
known elizabeth for?

1:07:56.206 --> 1:07:58.339
Our entire lives.

1:07:59.375 --> 1:08:00.875
You?

1:08:00.877 --> 1:08:01.876
Little less.

1:08:01.878 --> 1:08:02.877
[chuckles]

1:08:03.979 --> 1:08:06.414
[â™ª]

1:08:08.017 --> 1:08:10.351
Thank you. [laughs]

1:08:10.353 --> 1:08:11.619
[continues indistinctly]

1:08:11.621 --> 1:08:14.456
So the life of a mountie
must be quite dangerous,

1:08:14.458 --> 1:08:15.990
Especially
on the frontier?

1:08:15.992 --> 1:08:17.525
Yeah, it has
its good days

1:08:17.527 --> 1:08:19.627
And its bad days.

1:08:19.629 --> 1:08:21.162
I'm guessing
having to escort

1:08:21.164 --> 1:08:22.330
Elizabeth to hamilton

1:08:22.332 --> 1:08:24.132
Was one of
the good days?

1:08:24.134 --> 1:08:26.568
That wasn't
an assignment.

1:08:26.570 --> 1:08:27.836
Oh.

1:08:27.838 --> 1:08:29.671
So she asked you to come?

1:08:29.673 --> 1:08:31.973
Well, actually, I insisted.

1:08:34.043 --> 1:08:36.211
Well, I'm glad you did.

1:08:36.213 --> 1:08:39.180
She can be
rather independent.

1:08:39.182 --> 1:08:40.415
Ha! Yeah, I've noticed.

1:08:40.417 --> 1:08:43.952
Even if it isn't always
in her best interest.

1:08:46.255 --> 1:08:49.457
So working with elizabeth's
father must be interesting.

1:08:50.993 --> 1:08:53.328
He's really taken me
under his wing.

1:08:53.330 --> 1:08:55.930
Sometimes, it feels like
I'm the son he never had.

1:08:57.666 --> 1:09:00.001
[â™ª]

1:09:06.408 --> 1:09:08.576
-Thank you!
-[guests laughing]

1:09:09.879 --> 1:09:11.613
I have to say,

1:09:11.615 --> 1:09:14.682
I had a dickens of a time
during that last chukker.

1:09:14.684 --> 1:09:16.050
Old wickham got off a shot

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:18.052
That no one could
lay a stick on.

1:09:18.054 --> 1:09:19.187
[all chuckling]

1:09:19.189 --> 1:09:20.588
What in heavens
is he talking about?

1:09:20.590 --> 1:09:22.023
Polo.

1:09:22.025 --> 1:09:24.626
Somehow, I knew the subject
would turn to horses.

1:09:24.628 --> 1:09:26.528
Do you play polo,
sir lionel?

1:09:26.530 --> 1:09:28.062
It's one of
my favorite pastimes.

1:09:28.064 --> 1:09:30.565
I would love to see
your team play.

1:09:30.567 --> 1:09:32.133
Perhaps
you'll favor me

1:09:32.135 --> 1:09:33.401
With the pleasure
of your attendance

1:09:33.403 --> 1:09:34.569
This season.

1:09:34.571 --> 1:09:36.104
What a splendid
invitation.

1:09:36.106 --> 1:09:39.440
Constable thornton is
also quite the horseman.

1:09:39.442 --> 1:09:40.475
Thank you,
but I can't say

1:09:40.477 --> 1:09:42.877
I know a chukker
from a baseball bat.

1:09:42.879 --> 1:09:44.279
[all laughing]

1:09:44.281 --> 1:09:47.148
He has more important
things to worry about,

1:09:47.150 --> 1:09:48.516
Like keeping
coal valley safe.

1:09:49.818 --> 1:09:52.420
Or getting thrown out
of drinking establishments.

1:09:52.422 --> 1:09:54.022
-[drops fork]
-[conversations halt]

1:09:56.759 --> 1:09:59.093
Who was thrown out
of a drinking establishment?

1:09:59.095 --> 1:10:01.095
[julie]:
Jack's brother, tom.

1:10:01.097 --> 1:10:02.463
Who's every bit
as good-looking

1:10:02.465 --> 1:10:03.698
As his dashing
older brother.

1:10:04.934 --> 1:10:06.434
How is it
that you're acquainted

1:10:06.436 --> 1:10:08.136
With this "tom" person,
young lady?

1:10:09.405 --> 1:10:11.573
He landed at my feet
this afternoon.

1:10:14.243 --> 1:10:15.476
Well, literally.

1:10:16.779 --> 1:10:18.079
[agatha]: Well!

1:10:18.081 --> 1:10:19.414
This is much more
entertaining

1:10:19.416 --> 1:10:20.982
Than talking
about polo.

1:10:20.984 --> 1:10:22.684
-[jack chuckles]
-tell me.

1:10:22.686 --> 1:10:24.619
Do you make a habit
of drinking, constable thornton?

1:10:24.621 --> 1:10:26.421
No. No, I don't, mrs. Thatcher.

1:10:26.423 --> 1:10:28.223
Certainly
not on the job.

1:10:29.692 --> 1:10:32.493
W-- or really
much at all.

1:10:34.496 --> 1:10:35.964
Or ever.

1:10:35.966 --> 1:10:38.099
Except maybe at dinner.

1:10:40.035 --> 1:10:43.104
Perhaps it's
time for dessert.

1:10:43.106 --> 1:10:44.239
That's an excellent
idea, aunt agatha.

1:10:45.808 --> 1:10:46.874
Tell me, constable.

1:10:46.876 --> 1:10:48.810
What do you think
of peach melba?

1:10:48.812 --> 1:10:51.346
I'm sorry, who?

1:10:54.516 --> 1:10:57.051
It's ice cream.
With peach sauce.

1:10:58.554 --> 1:10:59.821
I know.

1:10:59.823 --> 1:11:01.456
I was just making a joke.

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:03.224
[others laughing]

1:11:11.667 --> 1:11:12.900
Your mountie has

1:11:12.902 --> 1:11:14.902
A very nice sense
of humor, my dear.

1:11:14.904 --> 1:11:18.072
He isn't "my" mountie,
aunt agatha.

1:11:18.074 --> 1:11:20.074
Isn't he?

1:11:23.245 --> 1:11:25.446
[â™ª]

1:11:28.584 --> 1:11:31.319
[charles and elizabeth
playing the piano]

1:11:35.024 --> 1:11:37.959
[â™ª]

1:11:45.601 --> 1:11:48.169
[elizabeth giggling
as they continue to play]

1:11:58.113 --> 1:12:00.214
[charles and elizabeth chuckling
as they play]

1:12:00.216 --> 1:12:02.283
I've forgotten
how it goes.

1:12:02.285 --> 1:12:05.119
You're still
better at it than me.

1:12:05.121 --> 1:12:08.356
Let's try it again?

1:12:08.358 --> 1:12:10.358
[they begin playing]

1:12:11.560 --> 1:12:13.528
[â™ª]

1:12:21.704 --> 1:12:23.971
[elizabeth chuckling]

1:12:25.874 --> 1:12:27.775
[â™ª]

1:12:27.777 --> 1:12:29.043
They're having such
a good time together,

1:12:29.045 --> 1:12:30.712
Aren't they?

1:12:30.714 --> 1:12:31.979
I've heard
they've been friends

1:12:31.981 --> 1:12:33.481
For a very long time.

1:12:33.483 --> 1:12:36.017
Charles and elizabeth
have a lot in common.

1:12:37.319 --> 1:12:39.287
They took lessons
from the same teachers,

1:12:39.289 --> 1:12:41.656
Shared the same friends,
skinned their knees.

1:12:41.658 --> 1:12:43.558
[both laughing]

1:12:43.560 --> 1:12:46.227
It's a bond that has
stood the test of time.

1:12:46.229 --> 1:12:48.096
Sometimes, what
people have in common

1:12:48.098 --> 1:12:50.331
Are the things
they feel inside.

1:12:50.333 --> 1:12:52.567
A shared spirit.

1:12:53.969 --> 1:12:56.504
Elizabeth is
spirited, all right.

1:12:56.506 --> 1:12:59.440
That's what I like
most about her, sir.

1:12:59.442 --> 1:13:02.143
Sometimes,
I think...

1:13:03.312 --> 1:13:05.179
She doesn't quite
know who she is yet.

1:13:05.181 --> 1:13:06.914
She has a tendency
to follow her heart

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:09.350
Instead of her head.

1:13:09.352 --> 1:13:11.152
She most likely will
wake up to it one day,

1:13:11.154 --> 1:13:13.988
And I would hate
to see her

1:13:13.990 --> 1:13:16.991
Pass up the life
she so dearly deserves.

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:19.761
[both laughing
as they stop playing]

1:13:19.763 --> 1:13:21.763
[others clapping]

1:13:23.599 --> 1:13:26.834
I don't think you need
to worry about that, sir.

1:13:26.836 --> 1:13:28.836
If she follows
her heart,

1:13:28.838 --> 1:13:31.072
I'm sure
she'll be just fine.

1:13:32.975 --> 1:13:34.942
[both laughing]

1:13:40.716 --> 1:13:43.317
[lively piano plays]

1:13:43.319 --> 1:13:45.520
[â™ª]

1:13:50.726 --> 1:13:53.094
[all applauding]

1:13:58.467 --> 1:14:01.402
Wow! You play
as pretty as you look.

1:14:01.404 --> 1:14:03.704
Oh! Well,
you talk even prettier.

1:14:03.706 --> 1:14:05.706
Yes, I do!

1:14:05.708 --> 1:14:07.809
You know what this town needs?

1:14:07.811 --> 1:14:09.710
Aside from a sawmill?

1:14:09.712 --> 1:14:11.746
Oh, I have a feeling
you're going to tell me.

1:14:11.748 --> 1:14:13.047
A theater.

1:14:13.049 --> 1:14:14.048
Theater?

1:14:14.050 --> 1:14:15.349
Mm.

1:14:15.351 --> 1:14:16.984
Why would you need a theater?

1:14:16.986 --> 1:14:19.987
Because I have played
on the "great white way"

1:14:19.989 --> 1:14:21.722
Of broadway
in new york city,

1:14:21.724 --> 1:14:23.524
And...

1:14:23.526 --> 1:14:26.060
Well, it would be a shame
to put my talent to waste.

1:14:26.062 --> 1:14:28.729
Ahh! So you're an actress?

1:14:28.731 --> 1:14:31.065
I was the lead in
<i>45 minutes to broadway.</i>

1:14:31.067 --> 1:14:33.868
Well, I thought you said
you were <i>on</i> broadway,

1:14:33.870 --> 1:14:35.837
Not 45 minutes away.

1:14:35.839 --> 1:14:38.105
Mm... [laughs]

1:14:38.107 --> 1:14:40.608
I see I have
a little educating to do.

1:14:43.011 --> 1:14:43.945
[spoon clinking glass]

1:14:43.947 --> 1:14:45.346
Ahem!

1:14:45.348 --> 1:14:49.951
Since we are no longer
going to be "coal" people,

1:14:49.953 --> 1:14:52.019
And with mr. Coulter
bringing us

1:14:52.021 --> 1:14:54.021
New life
and new hope--

1:14:54.023 --> 1:14:55.857
[man]:
Hear, hear!

1:14:55.859 --> 1:14:58.593
As mayor, I think
we should consider changing

1:14:58.595 --> 1:15:01.095
The name
of our fine town.

1:15:01.097 --> 1:15:04.198
And I'm open for suggestions!

1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:07.068
[buzzing chatter rises]

1:15:07.070 --> 1:15:09.270
[â™ª]

1:15:12.207 --> 1:15:14.442
Please tell me
you're not running off

1:15:14.444 --> 1:15:16.577
Before I get a chance
to see you again.

1:15:16.579 --> 1:15:18.279
I don't think I'll be able
to stay more than a few days.

1:15:18.281 --> 1:15:19.413
She's not
going anywhere

1:15:19.415 --> 1:15:20.481
Until we're sure

1:15:20.483 --> 1:15:21.549
Her mother
is fully recovered.

1:15:21.551 --> 1:15:22.650
Oh, william.

1:15:22.652 --> 1:15:24.051
You make it
seem like an invalid.

1:15:24.053 --> 1:15:26.554
I'm under dr. Clement's care,

1:15:26.556 --> 1:15:29.423
And I'm sure I'll be back
to my old self in no time.

1:15:29.425 --> 1:15:32.460
Then... Until
we meet again?

1:15:32.462 --> 1:15:34.328
Until then.

1:15:34.330 --> 1:15:36.397
Jack, it was so good
to see you.

1:15:36.399 --> 1:15:38.366
You, too, julie.

1:15:39.635 --> 1:15:41.669
Thank you
for inviting me.

1:15:41.671 --> 1:15:43.070
I hope
you had a good time.

1:15:43.072 --> 1:15:44.338
What's important

1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:46.107
Is that you're home
with your family.

1:15:46.109 --> 1:15:48.142
I'm at home
in coal valley, too.

1:15:48.144 --> 1:15:49.343
Constable,

1:15:49.345 --> 1:15:50.978
I trust you had
a pleasant evening?

1:15:50.980 --> 1:15:52.513
Very much.
Thank you, sir.

1:15:52.515 --> 1:15:53.748
Will we be
seeing you again?

1:15:53.750 --> 1:15:55.082
No.

1:15:55.084 --> 1:15:57.251
No, I'm leaving hamilton
in the morning.

1:15:59.454 --> 1:16:01.489
That seems kind of sudden.

1:16:01.491 --> 1:16:04.959
Well, you're safe
and settled with your family,

1:16:04.961 --> 1:16:06.961
And I have a job
to get back to.

1:16:06.963 --> 1:16:08.796
I've arranged for
constable mcginty to escort you

1:16:08.798 --> 1:16:10.631
Back to coal valley
when you're ready to return.

1:16:10.633 --> 1:16:12.533
That's very kind of you.

1:16:12.535 --> 1:16:14.468
It was very nice
meeting you, sir.

1:16:14.470 --> 1:16:16.871
Likewise.

1:16:16.873 --> 1:16:18.839
Miss thatcher.

1:16:20.943 --> 1:16:23.344
[â™ª]

1:16:39.795 --> 1:16:41.829
-Oh!
-I'm so sorry.

1:16:41.831 --> 1:16:43.064
No, no, thank you.
I've got it.

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:46.233
-Mr. Coulter?
-Mm-hmm.

1:16:46.235 --> 1:16:48.002
May I say it's a great thing
you're doing,

1:16:48.004 --> 1:16:49.403
Building that saw mill?

1:16:49.405 --> 1:16:51.806
It'll make such a difference
for the people in this town,

1:16:51.808 --> 1:16:53.240
Now that
that mine is closed.

1:16:53.242 --> 1:16:55.176
Making a difference is what
life is all about, isn't it?

1:16:55.178 --> 1:16:56.744
Indeed, it is.

1:16:56.746 --> 1:16:57.979
Good day.

1:16:59.247 --> 1:17:01.882
[â™ª]

1:17:10.192 --> 1:17:12.393
[â™ª]

1:17:16.231 --> 1:17:18.065
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:17:18.067 --> 1:17:20.434
Friends...

1:17:20.436 --> 1:17:22.670
You gave us

1:17:22.672 --> 1:17:24.572
Many wonderful suggestions!

1:17:24.574 --> 1:17:27.174
But in the end,
there can be only one.

1:17:27.176 --> 1:17:30.378
I give you...

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:32.513
The new name of our town--

1:17:32.515 --> 1:17:34.181
[whoosh]

1:17:34.183 --> 1:17:35.983
[applauding]

1:17:39.621 --> 1:17:41.689
[â™ª]

1:17:42.858 --> 1:17:45.126
[indistinct exchanges]

1:17:47.362 --> 1:17:50.064
Well, it looks like
change is in the air.

1:17:50.066 --> 1:17:52.767
It seems so.

1:17:52.769 --> 1:17:55.302
I understand you're
opening a saw mill.

1:17:55.304 --> 1:17:57.571
Yes. Yes, I am.

1:17:57.573 --> 1:18:00.741
It's quite
an ambitious project.

1:18:00.743 --> 1:18:02.810
I do like a challenge.

1:18:02.812 --> 1:18:05.579
The last fella
who tried building one

1:18:05.581 --> 1:18:07.982
Went belly-up
in six months.

1:18:07.984 --> 1:18:10.584
Well, that's not
gonna happen this time.

1:18:10.586 --> 1:18:13.387
No. Not if
you do it right.

1:18:13.389 --> 1:18:15.823
That's the only way
I do things, mr. Gowen.

1:18:15.825 --> 1:18:16.957
[gowen chuckles]

1:18:16.959 --> 1:18:18.959
Well, I do want
to see you successful,

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:20.161
Mr. Coulter,

1:18:20.163 --> 1:18:23.297
And I may be able
to help you with that.

1:18:23.299 --> 1:18:25.833
Really?
And how is that?

1:18:25.835 --> 1:18:28.836
Well, I know a lot
about this town.

1:18:30.072 --> 1:18:32.940
My expertise may be
of assistance to you.

1:18:32.942 --> 1:18:35.309
Hmm. With
the mine closing,

1:18:35.311 --> 1:18:37.645
I just assumed
you'd be moving on.

1:18:37.647 --> 1:18:39.847
No, no.
I won't be leaving.

1:18:39.849 --> 1:18:42.416
Huh. Aren't you
out of a job?

1:18:42.418 --> 1:18:44.518
Well, there'll
be plenty

1:18:44.520 --> 1:18:46.921
Of new opportunities
here in hope valley,

1:18:46.923 --> 1:18:48.489
And I plan on
taking advantage

1:18:48.491 --> 1:18:50.357
Of every one of 'em.

1:18:50.359 --> 1:18:51.826
Fair enough.

1:18:51.828 --> 1:18:54.261
Let me
think about it.

1:18:54.263 --> 1:18:56.130
Of course.
Take your time.

1:18:56.132 --> 1:18:58.432
I'll be here.

1:18:58.434 --> 1:19:00.868
[â™ª]

1:19:08.276 --> 1:19:09.977
So, did julie thatcher

1:19:09.979 --> 1:19:11.712
Say anything
about me last night?

1:19:11.714 --> 1:19:13.114
Not a word.

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:14.882
Oh, she talked about
me all night, didn't she?

1:19:14.884 --> 1:19:17.551
No. And stay
away from her.

1:19:17.553 --> 1:19:19.687
From all of them.

1:19:19.689 --> 1:19:21.322
Something happen
between you

1:19:21.324 --> 1:19:23.524
And the princess
elizabeth last night?

1:19:23.526 --> 1:19:25.392
It's none
of your concern.

1:19:25.394 --> 1:19:27.661
Well, if we have nothing
left to talk about,

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:28.696
I'll be on my way then.

1:19:28.698 --> 1:19:30.631
There's plenty
to talk about.

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:32.833
I want you to come
to coal valley.

1:19:32.835 --> 1:19:35.002
[snickers]
not on your life.

1:19:35.004 --> 1:19:36.036
Hear me out. Listen.

1:19:36.038 --> 1:19:37.872
I can get you steady work there,

1:19:37.874 --> 1:19:39.306
And it'll keep you
out of trouble.

1:19:39.308 --> 1:19:40.641
Oh, here we go again.

1:19:40.643 --> 1:19:42.476
I'm just trying to help.

1:19:42.478 --> 1:19:43.744
No, no. You're just trying
to keep me on a short leash.

1:19:43.746 --> 1:19:44.812
Tom.

1:19:44.814 --> 1:19:45.913
I've got my life here.

1:19:45.915 --> 1:19:47.815
You've got your life there.

1:19:47.817 --> 1:19:50.050
Let's leave it
at that.

1:19:50.052 --> 1:19:52.820
See you around, jack.

1:19:52.822 --> 1:19:54.488
Yeah.

1:19:54.490 --> 1:19:56.724
[â™ª]

1:20:15.277 --> 1:20:18.479
I didn't see you
at breakfast this morning.

1:20:19.681 --> 1:20:21.282
I wasn't hungry.

1:20:22.417 --> 1:20:24.118
It's hard
to come home again.

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:26.187
Isn't it?

1:20:28.356 --> 1:20:31.025
I was young once, too.

1:20:33.962 --> 1:20:36.463
I didn't realize
how much I missed it here.

1:20:37.933 --> 1:20:40.467
And how good it is
to see everyone.

1:20:40.469 --> 1:20:42.036
Even viola.

1:20:42.038 --> 1:20:43.237
Viola?

1:20:43.239 --> 1:20:44.672
Let's not go overboard.

1:20:45.740 --> 1:20:47.174
[laughs]

1:20:48.577 --> 1:20:50.477
[sighing]

1:20:50.479 --> 1:20:53.814
Maybe I was selfish,
leaving home to pursue my dream.

1:20:55.050 --> 1:20:57.151
No one's perfect, my dear.

1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:00.154
And being a little selfish

1:21:00.156 --> 1:21:03.057
Is something
we have to do sometimes,

1:21:03.059 --> 1:21:05.526
In the interest
of self-preservation.

1:21:08.463 --> 1:21:11.565
I'm just not sure
jack understands

1:21:11.567 --> 1:21:13.067
I need to be here right now,

1:21:13.069 --> 1:21:15.202
And that it doesn't change
the way I feel about him.

1:21:16.838 --> 1:21:18.672
Maybe you need to tell him.

1:21:19.774 --> 1:21:22.543
[â™ª]

1:21:26.748 --> 1:21:29.083
[â™ª]

1:21:31.686 --> 1:21:33.320
You sure are busy.

1:21:33.322 --> 1:21:34.588
Do you need
any help?

1:21:34.590 --> 1:21:35.756
Oh! I would love some.

1:21:35.758 --> 1:21:36.790
Where would you
like me?

1:21:36.792 --> 1:21:38.192
Out here,
or in the kitchen?

1:21:38.194 --> 1:21:39.593
Kitchen, please.

1:21:39.595 --> 1:21:41.195
I have to say,
abigail,

1:21:41.197 --> 1:21:43.998
For someone who's
working as hard as you,

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:45.199
You seem happier
than I've seen you

1:21:45.201 --> 1:21:46.467
In a long time.

1:21:46.469 --> 1:21:48.202
Well, when
business is good...

1:21:48.204 --> 1:21:50.971
Oh, I don't think
it is just the cafe.

1:21:50.973 --> 1:21:54.308
I've seen how you
and that handsome mr. Avery

1:21:54.310 --> 1:21:56.310
Look at each other.

1:21:56.312 --> 1:21:58.646
I say good for you.

1:21:58.648 --> 1:22:00.014
You deserve it.

1:22:00.016 --> 1:22:03.717
So does everyone else
in the town.

1:22:03.719 --> 1:22:06.487
It's time for the sadness
of the past to be over,

1:22:06.489 --> 1:22:08.055
Once and for all.

1:22:09.357 --> 1:22:12.126
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

1:22:13.962 --> 1:22:16.096
[â™ª]

1:22:20.969 --> 1:22:23.404
[station bustle and din]

1:22:24.839 --> 1:22:27.441
[conductor]:
Last train!

1:22:31.179 --> 1:22:33.213
[â™ª]

1:22:36.885 --> 1:22:38.886
Jack! Jack!

1:22:40.488 --> 1:22:42.189
-Jack!
-Elizabeth?

1:22:42.191 --> 1:22:43.924
What are
you doing here?

1:22:45.226 --> 1:22:47.494
We didn't have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1:22:47.496 --> 1:22:49.029
[laughs]

1:22:49.031 --> 1:22:50.664
It really wasn't
necessary for you--

1:22:50.666 --> 1:22:52.333
-Yes, it was.
-...To come all this--

1:22:52.335 --> 1:22:56.737
I don't know what went wrong
between us last night,

1:22:56.739 --> 1:22:58.872
But I don't want us
to part like that.

1:22:58.874 --> 1:22:59.840
Well, nothing went wrong.

1:22:59.842 --> 1:23:01.875
I just...

1:23:01.877 --> 1:23:03.043
Need to get back.

1:23:03.045 --> 1:23:05.412
I know you do, but...

1:23:05.414 --> 1:23:07.381
[conductor]: All aboard!

1:23:07.383 --> 1:23:09.883
That's my train.

1:23:09.885 --> 1:23:12.219
I'm sorry.
I-I have to go.

1:23:12.221 --> 1:23:13.287
Then...

1:23:15.023 --> 1:23:16.623
Then take this with you.

1:23:19.027 --> 1:23:21.295
[â™ª]

1:23:33.041 --> 1:23:34.975
[â™ª]
