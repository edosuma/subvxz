WEBVTT

00:09.050 --> 00:10.344
Buy a fruit bar.

00:11.052 --> 00:11.679
Okay.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.055
Buy a fruit bar.

00:14.807 --> 00:15.516
Okay.

00:16.391 --> 00:17.935
Buy a fruit bar.

00:18.393 --> 00:19.102
Okay.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.981
Buy a fruit bar.

00:22.648 --> 00:23.398
Why?

00:24.107 --> 00:25.359
I'm raising money

00:24.107 --> 00:25.359
for my scout troop.

00:25.609 --> 00:26.777
Buy a fruit bar.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.487
I don't want a fruit bar.

00:28.737 --> 00:29.947
Okay, you

00:28.737 --> 00:29.947
can have one.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.072
No, I really ha--

00:31.114 --> 00:31.824
No, I don't--

00:31.866 --> 00:32.658
Okay.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.370
Hey, guys.

00:36.411 --> 00:37.245
Come see what I got.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.706
It's going to

00:37.538 --> 00:38.706
be a bucket.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.665
Maybe it won't be.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.082
It's going to

00:39.707 --> 00:41.082
be a bucket.

00:42.584 --> 00:46.463
Look what I got from the bucket

00:42.584 --> 00:46.463
hut.

00:46.505 --> 00:47.840
You bought another bucket.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.132
I told you.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.218
This ones's

00:49.633 --> 00:51.218
really special.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.135
I'll tell you about it.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.052
So--

00:53.094 --> 00:54.179
Ooh, I got to

00:53.094 --> 00:54.179
take this call.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.222
Hello?

00:55.681 --> 00:57.391
Oh heyyyy.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.186
I know you're just

00:58.726 --> 01:01.186
talking into a fruit bar.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.524
Just tell me

01:03.647 --> 01:05.524
about your bucket.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.525
Okay.

01:07.776 --> 01:08.861
It's magnetic.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.198
Whoa.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.867
Who knew we had

01:13.240 --> 01:14.867
the technology?

01:15.158 --> 01:15.993
- Yeah.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.327
Hey, hey, hey.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.328
Hey, she's coming. Here she

01:17.369 --> 01:18.328
comes.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.329
Who's com--

01:23.124 --> 01:24.459
Oh, man.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.085
Go talk to her.

01:26.336 --> 01:27.337
Who? Bianca?

01:27.379 --> 01:28.255
- Yeah.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.214
You know you

01:28.380 --> 01:29.214
like her.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.592
Yeah.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.511
But Henry likes Chloe.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.471
He's not going to see

01:34.762 --> 01:36.471
Chloe for months.

01:36.513 --> 01:37.472
How come?

01:37.681 --> 01:38.724
She's doing that

01:37.681 --> 01:38.724
reality show

01:38.766 --> 01:39.767
"Kids in the woods."

01:39.808 --> 01:40.601
What's it about?

01:41.560 --> 01:43.520
Kids in the woods.

01:44.187 --> 01:44.813
Oh.

01:44.855 --> 01:45.773
Great title.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.026
(Charlotte)

01:47.441 --> 01:49.026
Ooh look, Bianca's alone.

01:50.069 --> 01:50.861
Okay.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.487
I'm going in.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.098
You didn't talk to her.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.141
I let my eyes

02:19.514 --> 02:21.141
do the talking.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.434
Yeah.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.184
And they said,

02:23.435 --> 02:26.772
duh, duh-de-duh.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.287
(Yelling)

02:42.329 --> 02:43.122
(Thud)

02:43.580 --> 02:44.623
(Ding)

02:47.084 --> 02:48.543
Hey, guys, what's the poops?

02:51.630 --> 02:52.714
We're all going to die.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.758
Wha?

02:56.093 --> 02:57.260
You're not going to die.

02:57.594 --> 02:58.762
You're indestructible.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.221
We are all going to die.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.640
Well, it's still

03:00.263 --> 03:01.640
bad for me.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.559
Who am I going to talk to

03:02.808 --> 03:04.559
when you're all dead?

03:05.769 --> 03:06.561
Whoa, whoa.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.688
What is going on here?

03:08.897 --> 03:09.564
That.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.361
What is that?

03:14.653 --> 03:16.071
That is a super volcano

03:16.947 --> 03:18.740
50 miles below

03:16.947 --> 03:18.740
the surface of the earth,

03:20.617 --> 03:21.785
right under this town.

03:22.036 --> 03:22.953
Oh.

03:23.662 --> 03:24.955
Hey,

03:24.997 --> 03:26.123
do you guys think I should

03:24.997 --> 03:26.123
get my teeth whitened?

03:26.999 --> 03:27.708
Henry.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.416
Your teeth?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.084
Are you crazy?

03:29.459 --> 03:30.585
Two days from now

03:30.627 --> 03:31.670
that volcano is

03:30.627 --> 03:31.670
going to pop

03:32.129 --> 03:34.255
like a big, red-hot

03:32.129 --> 03:34.255
throbbing pimple.

03:34.923 --> 03:35.674
Ew.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.551
Billions of tons of hot lava

03:37.592 --> 03:39.845
will spew from the ground

03:37.592 --> 03:39.845
and melt everything.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.471
You mean melt

03:40.179 --> 03:41.471
all of Swellview?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.640
All of the whole world.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.434
But I just ordered

03:44.641 --> 03:46.434
a new bike online.

03:48.103 --> 03:48.937
When does it get here?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.355
Next week.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.609
Oh, man.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.403
The whole world

03:54.985 --> 03:56.403
is going to end?

03:56.444 --> 03:57.154
You're sure of this?

03:57.196 --> 03:57.946
Yes.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.948
Schwoz has been

03:58.822 --> 03:59.948
watching the volcano,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.325
monitoring the vibrations,

04:02.367 --> 04:03.744
and doing all

04:02.367 --> 04:03.744
those calculations.

04:04.578 --> 04:05.662
How much time

04:04.578 --> 04:05.662
do we have left?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.167
Just under two days.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.793
Oh, oh, jeez.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.461
I got to go tell

04:11.835 --> 04:13.461
my mom and dad.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.546
And my cousins.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.505
And everyone.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.896
You could've just said,

04:28.852 --> 04:30.896
"Henry, come back."

04:32.397 --> 04:34.524
It's better if people don't

04:32.397 --> 04:34.524
now about the volcano.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.400
Why?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.027
So they can spend

04:35.943 --> 04:37.027
their last two days

04:37.069 --> 04:38.070
living their normal lives.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.238
Right.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.823
Enjoying the simple,

04:40.239 --> 04:41.823
important things like

04:42.616 --> 04:43.992
petting their dogs,

04:44.409 --> 04:45.869
and watching television,

04:46.661 --> 04:47.746
and going on the Internet

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
and expressing

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
strong opinions

04:49.330 --> 04:50.749
based on little or no

04:49.330 --> 04:50.749
knowledge or information.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.501
I do that.

04:54.836 --> 04:55.837
Well,

04:56.171 --> 04:57.923
if I only have two days

04:56.171 --> 04:57.923
left on this earth,

04:58.423 --> 04:59.549
I know what I'm doing.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.345
A gallon of ice cream

05:04.387 --> 05:05.597
and a spoon.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.974
(Machine)

05:05.639 --> 05:06.974
<i>A gallon of ice cream</i>

05:07.015 --> 05:07.808
<i>and a spoon.</i>

05:12.687 --> 05:13.730
(Henry)

05:12.687 --> 05:13.730
Oh, come on, Charlotte.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.523
You can't spend your

05:14.148 --> 05:15.523
last two days on earth

05:15.565 --> 05:16.775
just stuffing your face.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.027
Yes, I can.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.448
It all just kind of happened.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.533
My dad was

05:23.865 --> 05:25.533
an irresponsible scientist.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.953
I wanted an

05:26.034 --> 05:27.953
after-school job.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.870
(Captain Man)

05:27.995 --> 05:28.870
And by accident,

05:29.288 --> 05:30.789
he made me indestructible.

05:30.831 --> 05:31.706
Ah!

05:32.082 --> 05:33.541
(Henry)

05:32.082 --> 05:33.541
I went into this crazy store

05:34.042 --> 05:36.253
and met a pretty

05:34.042 --> 05:36.253
interesting guy.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.296
I'm going to blow your mind.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.965
(Captain Man)

05:38.337 --> 05:39.965
Now I protect the good

05:38.337 --> 05:39.965
citizens of Swellview.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.216
Who call me...

05:41.466 --> 05:42.259
- He turned out to be...

05:42.592 --> 05:43.302
- You know the name.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.427
- Captain Man!

05:44.678 --> 05:45.595
- That's right, Henry.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.307
(Captain Man)

05:46.596 --> 05:48.307
In time, I realized that

05:46.596 --> 05:48.307
being a superhero

05:48.347 --> 05:50.225
is a lot to handle alone.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.268
- He wanted some help.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.477
(Captain Man)

05:51.310 --> 05:52.477
I needed a sidekick.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.229
- I, Henry Hart...

05:54.271 --> 05:55.689
Pledge to never ever

05:54.271 --> 05:55.689
ever tell anyone...

05:55.730 --> 05:57.440
That I'm captain Man's

05:55.730 --> 05:57.440
secret sidekick.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.317
- It is done.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.526
(Henry)

05:58.650 --> 05:59.526
Now we blow bubbles.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.652
(Captain Man)

05:59.860 --> 06:00.652
And fight crime.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.945
(Henry)

06:00.694 --> 06:01.945
Feels good.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.211
Call it.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.670
Up the tube!

06:19.338 --> 06:20.588
Oh, my boot.

06:21.256 --> 06:22.007
- Ha!

06:24.592 --> 06:25.593
(Piper)

06:24.592 --> 06:25.593
No.

06:26.303 --> 06:26.970
No.

06:27.804 --> 06:28.429
No.

06:29.097 --> 06:29.973
Bad.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.390
Okay.

06:32.475 --> 06:33.935
Absolutely not.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.480
Hi honey.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.774
I dyed my hair brown

06:39.816 --> 06:41.193
and then I finished

06:39.816 --> 06:41.193
cutting down that old tree.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.528
Nice.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.404
Did you get the stump out?

06:45.446 --> 06:46.073
Not yet.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.407
Well, you got to get

06:46.740 --> 06:48.407
the stump out.

06:52.371 --> 06:52.996
Piper,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.666
why are you throwing

06:53.747 --> 06:56.666
all that food in the trash?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.459
Because all these foods

06:58.501 --> 06:59.502
contain gluten.

06:59.961 --> 07:00.962
Yeah, so?

07:01.296 --> 07:03.131
I'm gluten intolerant.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.553
What makes you think

07:06.634 --> 07:08.553
you're gluten intolerant?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.226
My friend Marla

07:12.349 --> 07:14.226
can't have gluten.

07:14.642 --> 07:15.685
And neither can the girls

07:15.727 --> 07:17.020
I eat lunch with at school,

07:17.354 --> 07:19.439
and there's lots of

07:17.354 --> 07:19.439
really cool celebrities

07:19.480 --> 07:20.648
who say gluten is bad.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.943
And celebrities

07:21.024 --> 07:22.943
know everything.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.029
Well, you still

07:24.694 --> 07:26.029
haven't told me

07:26.071 --> 07:27.864
why you think you

07:26.071 --> 07:27.864
can't have gluten.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.324
What is this?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.452
Oh, this is

07:30.617 --> 07:32.452
the last piece

07:32.493 --> 07:33.661
of wedding cake

07:33.703 --> 07:34.913
from when your dad

07:33.703 --> 07:34.913
and I got married.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.123
Gluten.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.169
Piper,

07:41.920 --> 07:43.422
if you really think you

07:41.920 --> 07:43.422
have a problem with gluten,

07:43.463 --> 07:44.631
we'd be happy to take you

07:44.672 --> 07:46.466
to a doctor to

07:44.672 --> 07:46.466
get an opinion.

07:46.841 --> 07:47.550
Fine.

07:47.842 --> 07:48.885
Book me an appointment.

07:49.219 --> 07:49.886
I will.

07:50.178 --> 07:50.804
Good.

07:56.435 --> 07:57.894
Hey, guys,

07:56.435 --> 07:57.894
I'm home from work.

07:58.686 --> 07:59.438
Hi, baby.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.397
Hey, Hen.

08:01.522 --> 08:02.983
Hey, I think I'm going

08:01.522 --> 08:02.983
to go next door

08:03.024 --> 08:05.026
and see if Chuck wants

08:03.024 --> 08:05.026
to watch "Pitch Perfect."

08:06.486 --> 08:07.862
Bye.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.657
I think I'm going to get

08:08.655 --> 08:10.657
some more brown hair dye.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.992
Bye.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.495
Hey, hey, wait.

08:15.536 --> 08:16.413
Wait up, guys.

08:16.455 --> 08:17.622
-What?

08:16.455 --> 08:17.622
-Whatcha need?

08:17.664 --> 08:18.373
(Henry)

08:17.664 --> 08:18.373
Well,

08:18.581 --> 08:20.083
I mean, we're a family

08:20.500 --> 08:22.836
and we're all

08:20.500 --> 08:22.836
here together now,

08:23.295 --> 08:24.212
but...

08:24.504 --> 08:25.964
maybe one day we won't be.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.548
So,

08:27.674 --> 08:28.383
can't we all just

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
hang out and talk?

08:31.970 --> 08:32.720
Why?

08:32.762 --> 08:33.638
Gross

08:32.762 --> 08:33.638
No

08:39.060 --> 08:41.188
(Schwoz)

08:39.060 --> 08:41.188
Two days from now

08:39.060 --> 08:41.188
that volcano is going to pop.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.647
(Ray)

08:41.229 --> 08:42.647
Billions of tons of hot lava

08:42.689 --> 08:43.815
will spew from the ground

08:43.857 --> 08:45.025
and melt everything.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.734
(Schwoz)

08:45.066 --> 08:46.734
All of the whole world.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.321
Hey, Henry.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.407
You ever look at the stars?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.076
Huh?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.287
Stars are amazing.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.706
Thousands of twinkling

08:57.537 --> 08:59.706
little lights

08:59.747 --> 09:01.249
shining in the night sky.

09:02.667 --> 09:03.793
All right.

09:07.088 --> 09:07.964
I love you, man.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.176
Okay, dude.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.678
Hey.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.804
Want to see a pic

09:13.720 --> 09:14.804
of my new bucket

09:14.846 --> 09:15.638
that I posted online?

09:16.723 --> 09:17.932
No, not really.

09:19.059 --> 09:19.934
What do you mean?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.479
Nobody cares

09:22.521 --> 09:23.771
about your dumb buckets.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.481
(Gasps)

09:27.942 --> 09:28.735
Wha, wha, wha.

09:32.030 --> 09:32.989
What's up with you?

09:33.614 --> 09:34.366
What?

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
First you tell me

09:35.116 --> 09:36.368
that you love me,

09:36.659 --> 09:37.702
then you scream at me.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.579
You're acting like my mom.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.499
I don't know, man.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.167
It's just

09:44.209 --> 09:45.460
life is short

09:45.752 --> 09:46.503
and--

09:46.545 --> 09:47.462
(Charlotte)

09:46.545 --> 09:47.462
Hey, guys.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.463
Here comes Charlotte.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.218
What's up?

09:54.261 --> 09:55.595
You went to

09:54.261 --> 09:55.595
inside-out burger?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.138
Yup.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.349
Since when do you eat

09:57.722 --> 09:59.349
chili cheeseburgers?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.808
I thought you were

09:59.599 --> 10:00.808
getting in great shape

10:00.850 --> 10:02.102
for that 10k run.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.811
I was.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.274
Now I'm eating this.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.111
Can I?

10:11.403 --> 10:12.112
Yeah, get in there.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.705
These have pickles on them.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.541
So?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.750
I thought you

10:24.583 --> 10:25.750
both hated pickles.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.295
Well, one day, Jasper,

10:28.336 --> 10:30.046
to love we may not

10:28.336 --> 10:30.046
even be here

10:30.297 --> 10:31.298
or hate pickles.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.966
So while I am here,

10:33.383 --> 10:34.801
I'm going to give

10:33.383 --> 10:34.801
pickles a chance.

10:36.553 --> 10:37.387
Me too.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.182
Okay, pickles are gross.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.016
I can't eat this pickle.

10:47.855 --> 10:48.898
Let's get to it, Schwoz,

10:48.940 --> 10:50.066
we don't have much time.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.239
Come on, Ray,

10:56.281 --> 10:58.199
why I have to keep doing this?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.159
I told you.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.868
I promised my grandmother

11:00.910 --> 11:02.454
that one day I'd learn

11:00.910 --> 11:02.454
how to dance the Jitterbug.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.038
And in...

11:04.080 --> 11:05.039
42 hours

11:05.624 --> 11:07.417
there won't be anybody left

11:05.624 --> 11:07.417
on earth to practice with.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.126
Now, come on.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.171
(Big Band music plays)

11:18.803 --> 11:20.347
And five, six,

11:18.803 --> 11:20.347
seven, eight.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.159
Buy a fruit bar.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.204
(Oliver)

11:43.161 --> 11:44.204
Hey.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.372
Buy a fruit bar.

11:46.789 --> 11:47.582
Yeah.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.916
I'll take a fruit bar.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.754
That'll be two dollars.

11:54.797 --> 11:55.590
You know what?

11:55.756 --> 11:57.384
I think I'll

11:55.756 --> 11:57.384
take two more

11:57.425 --> 11:58.468
of your fruit bars.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.015
I take cash or checks.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.477
I'm going over there.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.353
No.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.063
You don't want to mess

12:08.727 --> 12:10.063
with Mitch Bilsky.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.523
He's big and crazy.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.815
He's picking on Oliver.

12:13.149 --> 12:13.774
So?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.527
Oliver doesn't

12:14.275 --> 12:15.527
even realize it.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.490
Look,

12:20.532 --> 12:22.741
we only have 28 hours left

12:20.532 --> 12:22.741
before that volcano

12:22.783 --> 12:24.869
destroys the whole

12:22.783 --> 12:24.869
world on Friday.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.162
I know, but--

12:26.204 --> 12:27.372
I'm not holding

12:26.204 --> 12:27.372
anything back anymore.

12:27.746 --> 12:29.499
I told Jasper

12:27.746 --> 12:29.499
I don't like buckets,

12:29.541 --> 12:31.125
I ate five

12:29.541 --> 12:31.125
chili cheeseburgers

12:31.167 --> 12:32.377
after dinner last night,

12:33.002 --> 12:34.170
and now, I'm

12:33.002 --> 12:34.170
going to stand up

12:34.212 --> 12:35.547
to the biggest

12:34.212 --> 12:35.547
jerk in school.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.173
I fear no man.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.510
Hey, Mitch!

12:42.887 --> 12:44.222
I think you dropped this.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.811
Okay, Hart.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.564
Now...

12:54.524 --> 12:55.609
You and me are

12:54.524 --> 12:55.609
going to fight.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.235
You know,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.195
you really should get

12:57.860 --> 12:59.195
your teeth whitened.

13:02.073 --> 13:03.450
If you guys fight here,

13:03.866 --> 13:04.825
you're going to be surrounded

13:04.867 --> 13:06.160
by teachers in five seconds.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.537
(All)

13:06.202 --> 13:07.537
Yeah.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.371
It's true.

13:11.249 --> 13:12.125
Monday,

13:12.833 --> 13:13.918
after school in

13:12.833 --> 13:13.918
the parking lot

13:13.960 --> 13:15.336
behind that

13:13.960 --> 13:15.336
Jewish church.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.797
They're called Synagogues,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.049
idiot.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.051
Whatever.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.345
Monday after school

13:24.387 --> 13:26.222
behind the Cinderdog.

13:27.848 --> 13:28.558
On Monday?

13:30.351 --> 13:31.185
Yeah,

13:31.311 --> 13:32.061
sure, dude.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.146
Let's fight on Monday.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.230
Sounds good.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.276
Come on.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.403
Hey, Mitch!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.281
I take credit cards.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.044
Hey, Henry.

14:00.423 --> 14:01.215
What's up, man?

14:01.675 --> 14:03.176
You want to come

14:01.675 --> 14:03.176
ice fishing with me

14:03.217 --> 14:04.427
a week from Saturday?

14:05.679 --> 14:06.387
Oliver,

14:06.805 --> 14:07.846
every month you ask me

14:07.888 --> 14:09.265
if I want to go

14:07.888 --> 14:09.265
ice fishing with you.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.849
And what do

14:09.390 --> 14:10.849
I say every time?

14:11.267 --> 14:12.811
When I ask in person,

14:11.267 --> 14:12.811
you say no.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.229
Right.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.481
And when I text you,

14:16.523 --> 14:17.816
you just pretend

14:16.523 --> 14:17.816
you never got the text.

14:19.150 --> 14:19.776
Exactly.

14:21.194 --> 14:21.902
Now, guess what?

14:22.362 --> 14:22.987
What?

14:23.738 --> 14:25.156
I'd love to go

14:23.738 --> 14:25.156
ice fishing with you

14:25.198 --> 14:26.115
a week from Saturday.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.117
Seriously?

14:29.160 --> 14:30.077
Yep.

14:30.119 --> 14:30.870
Henry Hart,

14:30.911 --> 14:31.788
you make me happy.

14:38.002 --> 14:38.795
Ice fishing

14:38.837 --> 14:39.587
with Oliver?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.214
A week from Saturday,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.090
the world won't

14:41.881 --> 14:43.090
even be here.

14:43.924 --> 14:44.759
Yeah, I know.

14:47.136 --> 14:47.804
What are you eating?

14:48.262 --> 14:48.971
A stick of butter

14:49.013 --> 14:49.681
with sprinkles.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.016
Why?

14:52.058 --> 14:52.767
Why not?

14:54.352 --> 14:55.269
Hey, hey.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.229
There's Bianca.

14:56.646 --> 14:57.522
Go tell her

14:56.646 --> 14:57.522
you like her.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.981
What's the point?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.192
None of us are going to

14:59.482 --> 15:01.192
exist after tomorrow.

15:01.526 --> 15:02.736
Yeah, but if you tell her,

15:03.027 --> 15:04.945
maybe you'll get to

15:03.027 --> 15:04.945
kiss her before,

15:05.363 --> 15:06.447
you know...

15:06.489 --> 15:09.158
(explosion noises)

15:14.163 --> 15:15.039
Hey,

15:15.081 --> 15:15.832
Bianca!

15:16.249 --> 15:16.957
Oh,

15:17.291 --> 15:18.376
hi, Henry!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.502
I like you.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.005
And I don't just mean

15:23.047 --> 15:23.923
"I like you,"

15:24.382 --> 15:25.007
I mean

15:25.466 --> 15:26.760
I like you like you.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.470
Cool.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.513
Anything else?

15:31.180 --> 15:31.931
Nah.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.224
Yes.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.269
I would like to kiss you

15:36.686 --> 15:37.937
if you're down for that.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.314
With everyone watching?

15:40.940 --> 15:41.649
Yeah.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.735
Let's show them

15:42.358 --> 15:43.735
how it's done, son.

15:51.992 --> 15:52.577
How do you feel?

15:52.619 --> 15:53.745
Feel good.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.089
Okay, Piper,

16:05.131 --> 16:06.257
I went over everything

16:05.131 --> 16:06.257
with our dietitian.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.467
What did you find out?

16:07.508 --> 16:08.551
That you can eat

16:08.593 --> 16:09.719
all the gluten you want.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.763
What?

16:12.680 --> 16:13.556
You see?

16:13.598 --> 16:14.557
No, I don't see.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.016
I can't have gluten.

16:16.058 --> 16:18.060
I told you, bread

16:16.058 --> 16:18.060
makes me sick.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
But you also said

16:18.645 --> 16:20.480
you love spaghetti.

16:21.188 --> 16:21.815
So?

16:22.440 --> 16:23.566
Does spaghetti

16:22.440 --> 16:23.566
make you feel sick?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.860
No, it makes me

16:23.942 --> 16:25.860
feel powerful.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.697
Well, spaghetti

16:27.987 --> 16:29.697
is full of gluten.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.574
And since it doesn't

16:29.989 --> 16:31.574
make you sick,

16:31.866 --> 16:33.200
you don't have

16:31.866 --> 16:33.200
a problem with gluten.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.286
But all the popular

16:33.618 --> 16:35.286
kids in my class

16:35.328 --> 16:36.746
say they can't

16:35.328 --> 16:36.746
have gluten.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.539
And lots of really

16:37.079 --> 16:38.539
cool celebrities

16:38.581 --> 16:39.749
say they can't have it.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.919
Piper, gluten is

16:41.125 --> 16:42.919
a real problem

16:42.961 --> 16:44.712
for some people who

16:42.961 --> 16:44.712
are gluten sensitive,

16:45.254 --> 16:46.506
but it's not

16:45.254 --> 16:46.506
a problem for you.

16:47.006 --> 16:47.632
Matter of fact,

16:49.425 --> 16:50.510
I want you to have this.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.512
What is it?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.681
A gluten pot pie.

16:55.974 --> 16:57.934
Ooh, I love pot pie.

16:59.143 --> 16:59.978
Well, this one

17:00.019 --> 17:00.812
is loaded with gluten,

17:01.604 --> 17:02.772
which makes it perfect

17:02.814 --> 17:03.731
for little Piper.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.233
Well, thanks a lot, doc.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.820
Thanks for ruining

17:06.943 --> 17:08.820
my social life.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.447
Piper!

17:11.698 --> 17:13.073
I'll be in the car!

17:23.459 --> 17:24.752
(Beeping)

17:28.088 --> 17:29.423
Where have you guys been?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.509
In the man-copter...

17:31.926 --> 17:33.553
Flying over Swellview

17:34.512 --> 17:35.221
looking around...

17:35.596 --> 17:36.597
One last time.

17:37.849 --> 17:38.725
Nice.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
- Yeah, I guess.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.394
- Eh.

17:44.063 --> 17:44.856
(Ding)

17:46.607 --> 17:47.859
Hey peoples, look it.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.652
I got membership

17:47.901 --> 17:49.652
to muscle works.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.405
You joined a gym?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.322
Yeah.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.908
I paid for five

17:53.364 --> 17:54.908
years up front,

17:54.949 --> 17:56.534
which got me

17:54.949 --> 17:56.534
two percent off

17:56.576 --> 17:57.785
and this tank top.

17:59.662 --> 18:00.705
No, no, Schwoz,

18:01.121 --> 18:02.790
why did you pay

18:01.121 --> 18:02.790
for a gym membership

18:02.832 --> 18:04.458
when you know the world

18:02.832 --> 18:04.458
is going to end tomorrow?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.293
- Yeah why?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.293
- Yeah wh--

18:06.335 --> 18:07.754
You guys didn't

18:06.335 --> 18:07.754
get my text?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.297
-What text?

18:11.298 --> 18:12.842
Well, you know

18:11.298 --> 18:12.842
how I figured out

18:12.884 --> 18:14.886
that the super volcano

18:12.884 --> 18:14.886
go kaboom tomorrow?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.220
Yeah.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.513
Uh-huh.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.639
It's not going

18:17.555 --> 18:18.639
to happen tomorrow.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.224
Then when?

18:20.516 --> 18:21.183
In about

18:21.809 --> 18:23.436
17 million years.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.940
I swear I sent you a text.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.325
(All)

18:36.824 --> 18:38.325
We gonna live. Ha!

18:38.367 --> 18:39.702
(All)

18:38.367 --> 18:39.702
We gonna live. Ha!

18:39.744 --> 18:41.120
(All)

18:39.744 --> 18:41.120
We gonna live. Ha!

18:41.161 --> 18:42.872
(All)

18:41.161 --> 18:42.872
We gonna live. Ha!

18:42.914 --> 18:43.915
(All)

18:42.914 --> 18:43.915
We gonna live. Ha!

18:52.673 --> 18:53.507
Hey, buddy.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.426
Oh,

18:56.010 --> 18:56.677
hey, Hen.

18:57.428 --> 18:58.721
I got you something.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.850
A bicentennial bucket?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.143
Yep.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.813
Vintage from 1976.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.023
Wow.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.945
But you said nobody cares

19:11.484 --> 19:13.945
about my dumb buckets.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.738
Yeah.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.281
Listen...

19:17.740 --> 19:19.075
I was just jealous

19:19.742 --> 19:20.618
because

19:20.952 --> 19:22.829
you have such a cool

19:20.952 --> 19:22.829
bucket collection,

19:23.621 --> 19:24.622
and I don't have any.

19:26.206 --> 19:26.874
Thanks, man.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.543
Hey, guys!

19:29.585 --> 19:31.087
Check out my new bucket!

19:31.504 --> 19:32.212
(Groaning)

19:38.344 --> 19:39.053
Ah.

19:39.178 --> 19:39.846
Mitch.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.514
You know our

19:40.596 --> 19:41.514
little appointment

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
to fight after

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
school on Monday?

19:42.765 --> 19:43.683
Oh, yeah.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.351
Well, I can't make

19:44.100 --> 19:45.351
it on Monday.

19:45.768 --> 19:46.727
I'm getting my

19:45.768 --> 19:46.727
teeth whitened.

19:48.146 --> 19:49.689
Oh... well,

19:49.730 --> 19:50.731
that's too bad.

19:51.149 --> 19:51.816
No,

19:51.858 --> 19:52.692
it's not.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.401
Every teacher

19:53.192 --> 19:54.401
in this school

19:54.443 --> 19:55.653
is at a meeting right

19:54.443 --> 19:55.653
now in the auditorium.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.488
Are they?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.032
Yeah, dude.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.074
So let's run it

20:00.867 --> 20:01.617
right now.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.540
All right.

20:08.124 --> 20:08.916
I'll fight you.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.250
(Henry)

20:09.583 --> 20:10.250
Just...

20:10.793 --> 20:11.961
I'm just going

20:10.793 --> 20:11.961
to stretch a little.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.088
He's gonna stretch a little.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.507
You can't fight him.

20:16.549 --> 20:17.341
He'll murder you.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.593
Not if I zap him

20:17.925 --> 20:19.593
with this first.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.804
You know Ray says

20:21.846 --> 20:23.056
you're never supposed to use

20:21.846 --> 20:23.056
your kid danger stuff

20:23.097 --> 20:24.390
for your personal problems.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.141
I know.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.560
But he never

20:26.017 --> 20:27.560
said you couldn't.

20:27.810 --> 20:28.811
Ugh.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.563
Zap him before he hits me.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.272
I don't know, I don't know.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.858
Ugh.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.110
All right, Mitch.

20:37.695 --> 20:38.905
If you want to fight,

20:40.073 --> 20:42.075
then why don't

20:40.073 --> 20:42.075
you and I just...

20:42.491 --> 20:43.283
And I'm off the ground.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.915
And now you're going

20:46.954 --> 20:48.915
to feel some pain.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.332
(Henry)

20:49.498 --> 20:50.332
Yes.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.919
Now would be

20:51.125 --> 20:52.919
a good time for that.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.546
I say...

20:56.797 --> 20:58.591
Now would be a perfect

20:56.797 --> 20:58.591
time for action.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.308
Pretty impressive, Henry.

21:09.309 --> 21:10.186
Thanks.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.896
We should hang out

21:10.561 --> 21:11.896
next weekend.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.732
We'd be crazy not to.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.443
Cool.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.444
So I was thinking

21:17.484 --> 21:18.444
maybe we could--

21:18.485 --> 21:19.987
Excuse me, excuse me!

21:21.614 --> 21:22.740
Henry already has plans

21:22.782 --> 21:23.866
for next weekend.

21:24.909 --> 21:25.910
What plans?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.536
You and me,

21:27.578 --> 21:28.287
ice fishing.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.082
Oh yeah.

21:31.707 --> 21:32.458
But...

21:33.084 --> 21:34.376
Don't you think

21:33.084 --> 21:34.376
it'll be too cold

21:34.418 --> 21:35.669
on the top of mount

21:34.418 --> 21:35.669
Swellview next weekend?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.131
That's why I rented

21:36.087 --> 21:38.131
a tandem jacket.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.716
What's a tandem jacket?

21:49.558 --> 21:50.768
Ooh, I feel a tug.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.186
Help me pull.

21:57.608 --> 21:58.358
Yes.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.610
Nice Halibut.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.281
Clap with me.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.565
(Ding)

22:38.607 --> 22:39.441
Mmm...
