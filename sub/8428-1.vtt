WEBVTT

00:04.884 --> 00:07.637
We can do anything

00:07.764 --> 00:11.598
Just you and me.
Baby. Baby. Baby

00:11.724 --> 00:13.794
Wait and see

00:16.044 --> 00:19.320
Hold on. Sit tight

00:19.444 --> 00:22.481
Are you ready for a crazy ride?

00:22.604 --> 00:26.392
You're on your own. It ain't right

00:26.524 --> 00:29.163
Something's gotta give tonight

00:29.284 --> 00:33.072
So if you want to run.
Run and disappear

00:33.204 --> 00:36.355
You and I can bust our way
right out of here

00:36.484 --> 00:39.874
- Together we can
- Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

00:40.004 --> 00:43.440
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

00:43.564 --> 00:47.637
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

00:47.764 --> 00:50.119
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

00:50.244 --> 00:51.916
- Whoa-oh
- Together we can

00:52.044 --> 00:54.035
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

00:54.164 --> 00:57.474
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

00:57.604 --> 01:01.802
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

01:01.924 --> 01:04.882
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

01:05.004 --> 01:09.282
- If we take our time. We can have it all
- I don't think we're

01:09.404 --> 01:11.599
- Gonna make it
- On our own

01:11.724 --> 01:15.194
- Together we can
- Shoot the moon. Stop the rain.

01:15.324 --> 01:19.158
Even ride a hurricane.
If we wanna

01:19.284 --> 01:23.197
- Her foot's caught.
- Walk into space. Save the human race

01:23.324 --> 01:26.521
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

01:27.284 --> 01:30.196
Walk into space.
Save the human race

01:30.324 --> 01:33.043
Do you think we oughta. Oughta?

01:33.164 --> 01:36.122
Together we can

01:42.124 --> 01:44.319
Piñata!

01:44.444 --> 01:47.197
So we had some technical difficulties.

01:47.324 --> 01:51.442
I think it's a sign. Maybe we're not ready
for the talent show audition tomorrow.

01:51.564 --> 01:51.684
Chanel, listen to me. You finally hit
that high C in the second chorus.

01:51.684 --> 01:55.882
Chanel, listen to me. You finally hit
that high C in the second chorus.

01:56.004 --> 01:59.883
Never happened before.
I think that's a sign that we're ready.

02:00.764 --> 02:02.243
I did?

02:02.324 --> 02:04.440
I did, huh?

02:04.564 --> 02:07.681
And we hung in there like pros.
Aqua, barefoot and hungry,

02:07.804 --> 02:09.919
you kept our harmonies tight.

02:10.044 --> 02:14.242
Well, y'all know how you do it in Texas.
Always ride with your spurs on, girls.

02:14.364 --> 02:16.275
And Do-re-mi, you're sore now,

02:16.404 --> 02:19.999
but you gave 110 per cent to our fans.
How you feelin'?

02:20.124 --> 02:22.877
It was fun. And the bruises -
they're not that bad.

02:23.004 --> 02:25.359
Right. Now, if there is
one person who doubts

02:25.484 --> 02:29.159
that we can be the first freshmen to win
the Manhattan Magnet School talent show,

02:29.284 --> 02:31.798
speak now, or forever hold your peace.

02:38.004 --> 02:41.963
You know what? I take a whackin'
and keep on smackin'.

02:42.084 --> 02:44.439
Now, I am gonna be a star.

02:44.564 --> 02:48.842
Do I have to be solo, or are you
Cheetahs ready to hit it big time?

02:48.964 --> 02:51.273
Cheetahs!

02:52.844 --> 02:55.483
OK, so lights out by 9:30.

02:55.604 --> 02:58.072
I have lessons at the Youth Center,
and tons of homework.

02:58.204 --> 03:00.877
If I miss this bus, I'm gonna be
officially late for school tomorrow.

03:01.004 --> 03:02.596
Lessons? You need to rest those legs.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.919
- But...
- Let the girl take her lessons.

03:05.044 --> 03:06.955
Fine. Then I'll email you
what we're gonna wear.

03:07.084 --> 03:09.393
No. Because my computer
is still down.

03:09.524 --> 03:12.641
Just give it to me tomorrow.
I'll see you guys later.

03:12.764 --> 03:15.801
See, I'm still back in action.
See ya later. Bye.

03:15.924 --> 03:18.279
That girl is always on the move.

03:18.404 --> 03:22.317
Wait, taxi! It's called having a life,
and I've got one, too.

03:22.444 --> 03:24.639
My trig class at NYU
starts in ten minutes.

03:24.764 --> 03:25.799
Taxi!

03:25.924 --> 03:29.519
You've been here for six months and
you're still scared to ride the subway?

03:29.644 --> 03:33.000
Look, I told my daddy
I would live in New York.

03:33.124 --> 03:35.194
I never said anything about
under New York.

03:35.324 --> 03:38.122
It's dark and dirty and there are
mole people down there.

03:38.244 --> 03:41.554
Girl, whatever.
Learn this, Einsteinette.

03:45.124 --> 03:48.275
But you do have to get the door yourself,
you know.

03:51.084 --> 03:53.552
- Remember me.
- Thank you.

03:53.684 --> 03:55.117
Bye-bye.

03:55.244 --> 03:57.439
Princess High
of the land of Maintenance.

03:57.564 --> 04:01.716
Hey, she makes me giggle,
and she does have the lungs of life.

04:04.964 --> 04:07.273
Girl, it's so hard working with four girls.

04:07.404 --> 04:12.080
I mean, it was so much easier when it
was just you and me. Divas in diapers.

04:12.204 --> 04:14.957
But you know, Drinka was right.
We needed that backup, you know?

04:15.084 --> 04:19.236
Now that we got Aqua and Do, girl,
we look and sound like a real girl group.

04:19.363 --> 04:23.118
But what about tomorrow? I am not trying
to get crunched like corn chips. Believe it.

04:23.244 --> 04:25.963
Listen, we have what it takes.
Now all we need is the attitude.

04:26.084 --> 04:31.078
And when you get wobbly, think about the
dream. We could be grabbin' Grammys.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.879
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

04:35.004 --> 04:37.962
- I love you in the back row.
- Thank you.

04:38.084 --> 04:39.915
We'll be jugglin'
the hottest producers -

04:40.044 --> 04:42.638
Rodney Jerkins, Babyface,
Jackal Johnson.

04:42.764 --> 04:44.595
Yeah, and all the hot designers
are callin' us.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.636
They're like "Sorry, Dolce, I have
Gabbana on the other line."

04:47.764 --> 04:50.562
"Please hold on."
Chuchie, it's Gucci. Get Tom Ford.

04:50.684 --> 04:54.279
Oh, no, I wear Prada or nada. Mama.

04:54.404 --> 04:55.553
Nada!

04:55.684 --> 04:59.597
Please believe it. Girl, you promise me
that when we get rich,

04:59.724 --> 05:03.034
we're gonna buy a huge penthouse
apartment, just you and me?

05:03.164 --> 05:06.520
- Friends forever?
- Forever.

05:06.644 --> 05:08.680
Come on, let's go.

05:10.684 --> 05:14.472
Hold up. There's Scherezade.
That's Jackal Johnson's new girl.

05:14.604 --> 05:19.075
I love her. That's my video, girl.
She be like...

05:19.204 --> 05:21.354
Work it, girl.

05:22.084 --> 05:24.598
Come on, girl.

05:32.524 --> 05:33.798
Come on.

05:35.764 --> 05:38.073
Yeah, come on.

05:40.804 --> 05:42.317
That's right.

05:48.004 --> 05:49.153
Girlfriend.

05:54.084 --> 05:56.757
- I'll take that.
- Yeah.

05:56.884 --> 05:58.840
You know we can work it.

06:00.084 --> 06:04.714
Thank you. Thank you.

06:04.844 --> 06:09.440
You will be seeing our faces in these
windows very soon, watch out for...

06:09.564 --> 06:11.873
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Toto. I forgot about Toto.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.757
Mom and Dad's gonna kill me.
Come on, let's go.

06:14.964 --> 06:18.752
Yeah, Sally, everything's great.
Oh, Sandy, yes.

06:18.884 --> 06:23.355
Your ensemble's absolutely fabulous.
You're going to love it.

06:24.724 --> 06:28.239
The prodigal daughter has returned. Bye.

06:28.364 --> 06:31.162
Mom, I am so sorry I'm late.

06:31.924 --> 06:35.599
Oh, don't apologise to me.
I think you should talk to Toto.

06:35.724 --> 06:37.555
I can take myself to the bathroom,
thank you.

06:37.684 --> 06:40.676
Oh, I'm so sorry, pastamuffin.

06:40.804 --> 06:44.080
I promise, it'll never
happen again, OK? Oh.

06:45.164 --> 06:47.724
This is the last time
I'm gonna do your chores.

06:47.844 --> 06:50.039
Mom, I know I have been really busy,

06:50.164 --> 06:52.553
but the talent show's
auditions are tomorrow.

06:52.684 --> 06:56.677
- I promise you, it's gonna pay off.
- Pay?

06:56.804 --> 07:00.479
That's exactly what I wanted to
talk to you about. Constellation Jones?

07:00.604 --> 07:05.678
When were you going to tell me that
she wanted to reschedule her fitting?

07:05.804 --> 07:08.159
- I didn't tell you about that one?
- No.

07:08.284 --> 07:11.640
I thought I wrote it down, Mom.
Wait, let me check in the pad.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.483
Um, yeah.
"Constellation will miss Saturday."

07:14.604 --> 07:17.243
"Call her back, she can chat today."

07:17.364 --> 07:20.083
Oh. Right.

07:21.404 --> 07:25.556
I did this one as the Jamaican vibe
I was feelin' for the girls. Check it, see...

07:25.684 --> 07:28.152
Constellation will miss Saturday.

07:28.284 --> 07:30.320
Call her back, she can chat today.

07:30.444 --> 07:35.154
Bomp-bomp, kitty kitty. Oh, go, mama, go.
Chat-chat, kitty kitty, boop-boop...

07:36.604 --> 07:38.356
So that's your excuse?

07:38.484 --> 07:41.920
For making me look flaky
in front of one of my best customers?

07:42.044 --> 07:44.433
Comin' up with this,
what, cheetah chatter?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.634
- La donna è mobile...
- Papa!

07:46.764 --> 07:50.313
- I need you to help me.
- Help you? I tell you what needs help.

07:52.324 --> 07:55.794
My chicken piccata's ready for
the capers I asked you to bring home.

07:55.924 --> 07:59.234
Capers... right. My bad.

07:59.364 --> 08:04.677
Do me a favour, bring this pretty head
of yours down from the clouds and use it.

08:04.804 --> 08:07.443
I am using my head,
and once my plan jumps off,

08:07.564 --> 08:10.442
you'll be swimming
up to your ears in capers.

08:11.364 --> 08:13.320
And what plan might that be?

08:15.604 --> 08:17.674
You know what?
I think that I better have a seat

08:17.804 --> 08:22.514
because this is going to be a very
long story. Don't you think so, Papa?

08:22.644 --> 08:28.799
OK. First prize for the talent show -
time in a real recording studio.

08:29.364 --> 08:32.799
Where I can make a demo like a pro,
so I can put it in some big willie's hands

08:32.924 --> 08:36.394
and it'll be ka-ching, ka-ching,
bling bling bling...

08:36.524 --> 08:39.482
I thought it was "bling bling".
Now it's three blings?

08:41.683 --> 08:43.799
Fame and fortune just like that, huh?

08:43.924 --> 08:48.952
Mom, Monique Twig, Electra Breeze -
all talent show winners, all platinum.

08:49.084 --> 08:52.838
And Jackal Johnson. He went to
Manhattan Magnet, way back in the 90s.

08:52.964 --> 08:56.479
- Back before the Internet and all that.
- Mom, he's not that old.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.880
But listen, the Cheetah Girls
are first in line to win this thing.

09:00.004 --> 09:02.757
And when we do, we will be needing
buckets to bring in the ducats

09:02.884 --> 09:07.400
when it comes raining down.
And then I will cover you in ice,

09:07.524 --> 09:10.675
and we'll have "yes, sir" and "no, sir"
butlers and maids.

09:10.804 --> 09:15.275
- How do you like that plan?
- I love your plan, sweetheart.

09:15.404 --> 09:20.000
And your plans and your dreams
are very important to us.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.957
But before we can get to
maids and butlers and ice,

09:23.084 --> 09:27.635
we have to get to some responsibility.
So, here's my plan.

09:27.764 --> 09:32.679
That you focus on real life
and real chores, real, real soon.

09:38.204 --> 09:42.595
I promise I will get it together. Promise.

09:43.604 --> 09:46.038
Come on, Caper.
Daddy needs totos.

09:47.684 --> 09:49.197
Bye.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:58.084 --> 09:59.517
See ya.

10:36.444 --> 10:39.436
What is this?
What's she trying to...

10:43.844 --> 10:46.119
Ma, looking for something?

10:47.684 --> 10:51.723
Found it, huh? The bomb top
to wear to dinner tonight.

10:51.844 --> 10:55.883
Ma, don't say "bomb". It's out.
Say "tight".

10:56.004 --> 10:57.483
Tight. Tight.

10:57.604 --> 11:01.438
As in "That top is too tight
for anybody's mom to wear."

11:03.564 --> 11:06.237
It was cold.
But the Cheetah Girls, Ma...

11:06.364 --> 11:09.003
- Ooh, now it's working.
...were off the hook.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.677
Ma, what about this?

11:13.804 --> 11:16.159
It's cheetahlicious. Yeah.

11:18.404 --> 11:22.716
Now this is tight, huh? You're gonna
be my daughter the fashion buyer.

11:22.844 --> 11:25.722
No, Ma. I'm gonna be your daughter
the Cheetah Girl, remember?

11:25.844 --> 11:27.436
Did you say somethin', mija?

11:27.564 --> 11:31.273
Yeah, I said..."So, another date
with that French guy?"

11:31.404 --> 11:35.238
Excuse me, but Luc is not just
"that French guy".

11:36.524 --> 11:39.197
How would you like it if people called you
"the Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican..."

11:39.324 --> 11:43.476
- They do. That's who I am.
- No.

11:43.604 --> 11:46.437
I taught you that what matters
is what's inside.

11:46.564 --> 11:49.362
And deep inside, Luc is...

11:49.484 --> 11:51.202
very, very...

11:53.444 --> 11:55.799
rich.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.643
I'm just joking.

11:58.764 --> 12:03.599
There he is. OK, my baby,
you're gonna lock up, OK? And let's see.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.558
Pucci is staying at your dad's, so you don't
have to worry about him at all. OK? And...

12:07.684 --> 12:09.436
I know I'm forgetting something,
I know...

12:09.564 --> 12:14.080
- Ma? Ma? You might want that.
- Baby, you are my angel. Come here.

12:14.204 --> 12:16.081
- Mommy...
- I'm on celly, jelly.

12:16.204 --> 12:18.843
- OK. Mommy, I want to talk to you...
- We'll be back later, OK?

12:18.964 --> 12:20.841
- Ma. Ma!
- I'm so late.

12:20.964 --> 12:22.841
I love ya.

12:27.564 --> 12:30.078
By the way, Ma,

12:30.204 --> 12:32.638
I hit a high C today
with the Cheetah Girls.

12:34.284 --> 12:36.957
Cheetah Girls

12:41.404 --> 12:44.714
Could ever be

12:44.844 --> 12:46.675
Made mistakes before

12:46.804 --> 12:51.036
But I know I'm not perfect
It's OK cos...

12:51.164 --> 12:53.439
- Bueno?
- Hey, Chuchie. Madrina still not home?

12:53.564 --> 12:58.035
Nope. I guess Mr Tycoon
flew her to Paris for dinner.

12:58.164 --> 13:00.075
I'm still here for you, Chuchie,
you know that.

13:00.204 --> 13:04.083
- Thanks, Bubbles.
- No problem. Hey, girl, listen to this.

13:04.204 --> 13:07.321
I made mistakes before

13:07.444 --> 13:10.481
But I know I'm not perfect

13:10.604 --> 13:12.834
It's OK cos who could...

13:12.964 --> 13:16.798
Hey, Toto, do you like that one?
Guess what, Chuchie? Toto likes it.

13:16.924 --> 13:20.155
Is it gonna be a hit, Toto?
All right, he thinks it's a hit.

13:20.284 --> 13:22.161
Go Cheetahs, go Toto.

13:22.284 --> 13:24.593
Win the talent show,
we goin' straight to the top.

13:24.724 --> 13:27.636
Yeah, let's get through
the tryouts first, a'ight?

13:29.124 --> 13:31.354
As long as I give my best

13:31.484 --> 13:33.793
It don't matter what no one says

13:33.924 --> 13:37.280
Cos down in my heart
I got the power to make it all happen...

13:42.164 --> 13:44.314
Hey, Chanel, how did that test go?

13:44.444 --> 13:48.357
Are you guys sure that the Louisiana
Purchase had nothing to do with gumbo?

13:48.484 --> 13:51.920
Chuchie, you can't drop your grades now.
I'm calling a Cheetah study session.

13:52.044 --> 13:55.195
It's OK. I'll walk you through
the history of her story

13:55.324 --> 13:57.963
and you can walk me
through your closet.

13:58.084 --> 13:58.994
A'ight.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.560
- Cheetah.
- Crikey, Mackerel.

14:02.684 --> 14:05.994
We've spotted the wild Cheetah Girls
doin' their secret girl handshake.

14:06.124 --> 14:09.082
What would they do if they were, say,
the Elephant Girls?

14:10.124 --> 14:14.003
Basta pasta, Derek. You too, Mackerel.
You know, we call ourselves the Cheetahs

14:14.124 --> 14:19.323
because the cheetah is the fastest, fiercest
feline in the jungle. Let's bounce, girls.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.520
I'm trying to keep it
Lite FM with you, Derek. OK?

14:22.644 --> 14:25.078
I'm saving my energy for
the talent show, remember?

14:25.204 --> 14:28.958
Or are you throwing in the towel
cos you know you're gonna lose?

14:29.084 --> 14:31.120
See, that's what I need
to talk to you about.

14:31.244 --> 14:34.793
See, your little project
auditions at 3:15, right?

14:34.924 --> 14:38.234
We're at 3:30. Can we switch times?

14:38.364 --> 14:41.436
Our setup takes time.
We use real instruments.

14:42.564 --> 14:44.998
And help you? I don't think so.

14:45.124 --> 14:49.276
I have an orthodontist's appointment
and my mom's gonna freak if I'm late.

14:50.004 --> 14:54.236
Let 'em take the spot. I have to meet
with Mrs Almanac about my history test.

14:54.364 --> 14:56.559
You know what? I'm not very
comfortable with change.

14:56.684 --> 15:00.359
- But how's everybody else?
- It's cutting a little tight for me, but...

15:00.484 --> 15:04.443
- Where do you always have to go, Do?
- Nowhere. Don't worry, I'm fine.

15:04.564 --> 15:07.362
OK, Hambone. Whatever.

15:07.484 --> 15:13.002
Just know that you can audition
five times, but you're still gonna lose.

15:13.124 --> 15:17.037
Keep believin', freshman.
I respect that.

15:17.164 --> 15:19.837
But you know you're still my boo.

15:22.564 --> 15:25.078
She likes you.

15:25.204 --> 15:27.274
He's trying so hard not to like you.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.964
And I think now would be
the proper time to point out

15:30.084 --> 15:32.723
that he is extra-specially cheetahlicious.

15:32.844 --> 15:36.314
It's a trick, you guys. Every time he bats
those long eyelashes of his,

15:36.444 --> 15:41.074
it's just a way to bring down the hammer
on our success. Don't fall for it.

15:49.164 --> 15:53.282
He even makes really embarrassing
things look really, really cute.

15:53.404 --> 15:57.522
And he wants you to be his boo.

16:00.964 --> 16:04.513
He's gonna be cryin' "boohoo"
when we win the talent show.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.283
True.

16:07.764 --> 16:09.197
Let's get out of here.

16:14.644 --> 16:19.798
May the growl power of all the fabulous
divas who came before us be with us now.

16:19.924 --> 16:23.234
May we use our hearts,
our brains and our courage

16:23.364 --> 16:25.673
to reach our cheetahlicious potential.

16:25.804 --> 16:28.477
Right here, right now.

16:30.044 --> 16:32.239
Ready, girls?

16:32.364 --> 16:35.595
- Cheetah!
- Let's do this.

16:35.724 --> 16:38.397
OK, here we go.

16:38.524 --> 16:41.118
OK. Be quiet.

16:41.244 --> 16:43.314
Here, push this one.

16:53.764 --> 16:55.914
When I was just a little girl

16:56.044 --> 16:59.275
My mama used to tuck me into bed

16:59.404 --> 17:02.680
And she'd read me a story

17:02.804 --> 17:06.001
It always was about
a princess in distress

17:06.124 --> 17:08.035
And how a guy would save her

17:08.164 --> 17:11.634
And end up with the glory

17:11.763 --> 17:13.993
I'd lie in bed and think about

17:14.124 --> 17:16.398
The person that I wanted to be

17:16.523 --> 17:18.674
Then one day I realised

17:18.804 --> 17:20.635
The fairy-tale life wasn't for me

17:20.763 --> 17:23.232
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

17:23.364 --> 17:25.275
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

17:25.404 --> 17:27.634
Waiting for somebody

17:27.763 --> 17:30.153
To come and set me free

17:30.284 --> 17:32.240
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

17:32.364 --> 17:34.195
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

17:34.324 --> 17:38.203
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

17:38.324 --> 17:41.361
Don't wanna be no. No. No one else

17:41.484 --> 17:44.203
I'd rather rescue myself

17:51.884 --> 17:56.355
I can slay my own dragons

17:56.484 --> 18:01.160
I can dream my own dreams

18:01.284 --> 18:05.562
My knight in shining armour

18:05.684 --> 18:08.039
Is me

18:08.164 --> 18:10.678
So I'm gonna set me free

18:10.804 --> 18:12.840
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

18:12.964 --> 18:15.239
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

18:15.364 --> 18:17.434
Waitin' for somebody

18:17.564 --> 18:19.839
To come and set me free

18:19.964 --> 18:22.034
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

18:22.164 --> 18:24.359
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

18:24.484 --> 18:28.716
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

18:28.844 --> 18:30.994
I don't wanna be like Cinderella

18:31.124 --> 18:33.433
Sittin' in a dark. Cold. Dusty cellar

18:33.564 --> 18:35.441
Waitin' for somebody

18:35.564 --> 18:37.794
To come and set me free

18:37.924 --> 18:40.074
I don't wanna be like someone waiting

18:40.204 --> 18:42.001
For a handsome prince
to come and save me

18:42.124 --> 18:46.003
Oh. I will survive
I know somebody's on my side

18:46.124 --> 18:49.434
Don't wanna be no. No. No one else

18:49.564 --> 18:53.034
I'd rather rescue myself

18:57.804 --> 19:00.193
So, Drinka, what do you think?

19:01.524 --> 19:04.800
Drinka? Drinka, you still there? Drinka?

19:09.644 --> 19:12.795
- Drinka, were we that bad?
- Yeah.

19:12.924 --> 19:16.439
- Tell them. They can take it.
- I'm all right.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.875
I will survive.

19:21.004 --> 19:23.359
It's just that...

19:24.164 --> 19:28.919
when I see you girls,
I see myself.

19:29.044 --> 19:35.279
I mean, not now as a lowly high-school art
teacher, but as Drinka Champagne, 1977.

19:35.404 --> 19:37.156
I had a hit.

19:37.604 --> 19:41.199
- Champagne bubbles of love
- Sing it, girl.

19:41.324 --> 19:45.442
You're the only one
I been dreamin' of...

19:45.564 --> 19:50.194
Drinka... You gotta slow down
the disco fever, Drinka.

19:50.324 --> 19:55.398
You know what? When I see you girls,
I see, like, little Drinka clones.

19:55.524 --> 19:57.719
Galleria, when I look at you,

19:57.844 --> 20:00.881
I see a biracial,
hip-hoppin' version of me.

20:01.004 --> 20:03.837
And Chanel, when I look at you, honey,

20:03.964 --> 20:08.515
I see a hot, Latin, spicy version of me.

20:08.644 --> 20:11.477
And Aqua, when I look at you,

20:11.604 --> 20:14.801
I see myself as if I was from
the sassy South.

20:14.924 --> 20:19.839
And Dorinda, when I see you,
I see you as if I was...

20:19.964 --> 20:22.353
If you were what? Go ahead and say it.
Everyone else does.

20:22.484 --> 20:25.760
"Dorinda's like me
if I was shrimpy and White."

20:25.884 --> 20:28.637
If I was able to dance.

20:29.644 --> 20:32.158
Drinka, we just want to know, are we in?

20:32.284 --> 20:36.357
Oh, yes, honey. You are in.

20:39.564 --> 20:42.203
But, Drinka, like, do we actually
have a chance of winning?

20:42.324 --> 20:47.159
Oh. Yes. And I'll work with you,
just like I worked with Electra Breeze.

20:47.284 --> 20:49.593
Or maybe I'll work with 'em.

20:49.724 --> 20:52.192
Jackal Johnson? You're here?

20:54.124 --> 20:58.402
Jackal Johnson.
My most famous student.

20:58.524 --> 21:02.403
Well, how you doin'? You look
fabulous. What are you doin' here?

21:02.524 --> 21:06.403
I see that talent show banner outside,
and I wanna be back walkin' these halls.

21:06.524 --> 21:09.641
- I still keep my hand in the community.
- The Jackal keeps it real.

21:09.764 --> 21:14.280
And I haven't seen this much talent
on that stage since my graduation.

21:15.364 --> 21:18.834
Well, you know, the Cheetahs,
they're my latest project.

21:18.964 --> 21:21.683
You always could spot talent, Drinka.

21:21.804 --> 21:25.160
And now I'd like to talk to you ladies
about the next step in your career.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.593
- Jackal Johnson wants to work with us.
- You see,

21:27.724 --> 21:30.079
I'm lookin' for the next big thing.

21:30.204 --> 21:34.277
And I think that thing
might just have spots.

21:34.404 --> 21:36.122
Let's get down there.

21:36.244 --> 21:38.155
We have spots. We have spots.

21:42.204 --> 21:46.038
Jackal, when you're ready
to talk dollars and cents, my card.

21:46.164 --> 21:48.917
- Cheetah Girls' manager, Kid Salsa.
- Pucci!

21:49.044 --> 21:51.683
Chanel, get your brother out of here.

21:52.764 --> 21:54.800
Hello, Jackal Johnson.
I'm Galleria Garibaldi.

21:54.924 --> 21:58.519
I'm the founder of the Cheetah Girls.
I also wrote "Cinderella",

21:58.644 --> 22:02.319
which I hope to record for you
in the near future.

22:02.444 --> 22:04.594
Excellent. Excellent.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.874
So let's set something up.
Schedule.

22:07.004 --> 22:09.393
Hold on.

22:09.524 --> 22:12.880
I am Dorothea Garibaldi, and there must
be some misunderstanding here.

22:13.004 --> 22:16.679
You see, singing is just some, like,
fun side thing for our girls.

22:16.804 --> 22:20.763
- They're not professionals.
- Mom! Mom. This is Jackal Johnson.

22:20.884 --> 22:25.162
He's one of the biggest
record producers of my time, Mother.

22:27.204 --> 22:30.037
Let's see, now.

22:30.164 --> 22:35.716
Eight Grammys, $ 20 million label deal,
multi-picture movie deal,

22:35.844 --> 22:40.235
four houses, seven cars,
and you're allergic to dogs.

22:40.364 --> 22:42.036
- Nice work.
- I read.

22:43.484 --> 22:46.237
- Nice to have met you, Mr...
- Jackal Johnson.

22:46.364 --> 22:49.754
Yes, Jackal Johnson.
Yes, of course.

22:50.844 --> 22:55.440
Girls, come on. I'm gonna take us all
out to eat, OK? Get your stuff. Come on.

22:55.564 --> 22:58.442
Jackal Johnson. But...

22:58.564 --> 23:03.274
Listen. Just in case, there's my card.
Your mom's no joke.

23:03.404 --> 23:05.713
No. None. Never.

23:06.364 --> 23:08.241
Bye, Mr Johnson.

23:23.364 --> 23:25.719
Thanks for droppin' me off.
I just... I live right here.

23:25.844 --> 23:29.962
- Oh, good. Watch the cars.
- OK. Bye-bye.

23:30.084 --> 23:32.518
Lovely girl.

23:40.684 --> 23:44.120
Dorinda seems like a real nice girl.
What are her parents like?

23:45.204 --> 23:48.560
The only thing we know
is she has a little sister.

23:48.684 --> 23:51.721
Her parents aren't always
up in her thing.

23:51.844 --> 23:53.721
They trust her.

23:55.524 --> 23:59.563
You got in the talent show. Don't spoil this
day because you didn't get all you wanted.

23:59.684 --> 24:02.676
At this rate, you're headed
straight to your room.

24:06.724 --> 24:10.080
Mama, Jackal liked my song.
That was our big chance.

24:10.204 --> 24:12.638
- Didn't you think we were talented?
- Of course, sweetheart.

24:12.764 --> 24:15.278
You're incredibly talented.
You know I think that.

24:15.404 --> 24:17.122
You'll be just as talented after college.

24:17.244 --> 24:21.203
Mama, one CD and I can pay for college,
Ma. 50 times over.

24:21.324 --> 24:24.634
Then you would not have the time to study,
you wouldn't have the grades to get in,

24:24.764 --> 24:26.959
and that, my dear,
is what you call a paradox.

24:27.084 --> 24:30.520
Some colleges don't even look at grades.
Some people don't even go to college.

24:30.644 --> 24:33.238
- Franco?
- Galleria, you're not helping yourself here.

24:33.364 --> 24:36.037
Papa, tell her I'm not a knucklehead.
Tell her I'm not a pazza.

24:36.164 --> 24:38.041
- "Tell her?"
- You're not a pazza.

24:38.164 --> 24:41.474
But you know what? You have to
listen to your mother's advice.

24:41.604 --> 24:44.801
Now, listen. The bottom line is,
Galleria, you are too young.

24:44.924 --> 24:46.801
Now, I've been there,
and I know what it's like

24:46.924 --> 24:49.484
when a young girl gets under pressure
and cannot handle it.

24:49.604 --> 24:52.721
Silly people do silly things, Mom.
I get good grades.

24:52.844 --> 24:54.880
I spend more time on my homework
than I do my hair.

24:55.004 --> 24:58.633
I set my mind to something, and I almost
get there, and you just stand in my way.

24:58.764 --> 25:02.279
What's the good of eating your
vegetables if you can't have dessert?

25:02.404 --> 25:04.759
Strong bones and teeth.

25:14.924 --> 25:17.233
Ma, it's not fair that
we don't get to talk to Jackal.

25:17.364 --> 25:20.640
Honey, I think Dorothea's instincts
are right on this one, OK?

25:20.764 --> 25:23.039
I mean, you don't need to be
working with this Jackal.

25:23.164 --> 25:25.883
All that platinum and those
heavy chains. It's tacky.

25:26.004 --> 25:27.960
Ma, it doesn't matter how he dresses.

25:28.084 --> 25:33.363
He's not like the men from Paris.
I mean, Luc... Oh! He is always on...

25:33.484 --> 25:38.717
Ma, can you not talk about Luc for one
second? I'm really upset here. Really.

25:38.844 --> 25:41.153
And I know what's gonna cheer you up.

25:41.284 --> 25:43.275
You gonna talk to Madrina
and tell her to change her mind?

25:43.404 --> 25:45.156
Nope.

25:45.884 --> 25:48.762
Shopping. You and me shopping.

25:49.804 --> 25:53.592
- OK. And then you'll talk to Madrina?
- Yes. Yes.

25:53.724 --> 25:55.999
- Now, I have to ask you.
- What?

25:56.124 --> 25:59.400
What do you think about Paris?

25:59.524 --> 26:01.833
- What, Luc wants you to visit?
- Mm-hm.

26:01.964 --> 26:05.240
To visit and... to live...

26:05.364 --> 26:07.594
Whoa! What?

26:12.684 --> 26:15.437
Hello? Hold on, Bubbles.
To live?

26:15.564 --> 26:19.079
- Promise me you'll think about it.
- Oh, I'll think about it, all right.

26:19.204 --> 26:23.197
Oh, my God, Bubbles,
thank goodness it's you. My life is over.

26:23.324 --> 26:25.394
She won't even let me call Jackal.

26:25.524 --> 26:29.642
She used every excuse in the book
to ruin our lives. Well, you know what?

26:29.764 --> 26:34.201
This isn't over. OK?
I am not dropping all of our hard work.

26:34.324 --> 26:36.679
Juanita is trying to move
to Paris with Mr Tycoon.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.001
Didn't they see us tonight? Don't they
know that our futures are right here?

26:40.124 --> 26:43.878
- Bella. Let the girl call the producer.
- No.

26:50.044 --> 26:53.673
None of those tricks. You bat those
long eyelashes, and I say yes every time.

26:53.804 --> 26:56.637
No, Franco, she's too young.

26:56.764 --> 26:58.641
I have made so many
mistakes in my life,

26:58.764 --> 27:01.836
and I'm determined not to have our
daughter make the same mistakes I did.

27:01.964 --> 27:05.639
She's not going to make the same
mistakes. She will make her own.

27:05.764 --> 27:08.483
- That's how she'll learn.
- But what if her dreams fall apart?

27:08.604 --> 27:10.754
If she's older, she might be more...

27:10.884 --> 27:14.957
More... ready.

27:15.084 --> 27:18.918
Cara. No one is ever ready
for their dreams to fall apart.

27:19.044 --> 27:24.801
But when she's older, we're not going to be
there to help her put them back together.

27:30.844 --> 27:35.474
It's sick. She dangled a shopping trip
in my face, and then lowered the boom.

27:35.604 --> 27:39.153
Well, you know what?
Tell her no chance, no dance.

27:39.284 --> 27:42.481
No, wait. Take the shopping trip first,
then tell her.

27:42.604 --> 27:44.674
- Galleria?
- Wait a second. Hold on.

27:44.804 --> 27:47.034
Your mother and I...

27:49.764 --> 27:51.959
Girl, hold on.
Somethin' about to happen. Hold on.

28:00.324 --> 28:03.157
Your father thinks that this would be
a good experience for you,

28:03.284 --> 28:07.197
so you can go on and call
that record producer person.

28:07.884 --> 28:12.082
Thank you, Mom. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.677
- But there are conditions.
- I'd better sit down for this one.

28:16.524 --> 28:19.516
First, I will be going
to the meeting with you.

28:19.644 --> 28:23.432
Second, if I don't like what's going on
there, we are out. Number three...

28:23.564 --> 28:27.318
And number three,
she promises to keep an open mind.

28:31.524 --> 28:34.243
Chuchie, they're gonna
let me call Jackal.

28:34.364 --> 28:36.798
- Dad comes through for me again.
- Wow.

28:36.924 --> 28:39.154
We're gonna have our penthouse soon.

28:39.284 --> 28:43.562
Oh, today has been
just so Cheetah-crazy.

28:43.684 --> 28:47.313
Yeah. You were definitely
a little loco tonight.

28:47.444 --> 28:49.912
Since when are you
the founder of the Cheetah Girls?

28:50.044 --> 28:52.114
- What?
- Yeah, that's what you told Jackal.

28:52.244 --> 28:57.318
You were all "I wrote the song 'Cinderella'
and I'm the founder of the Cheetah Girls."

28:57.444 --> 29:00.004
- Yadda, yadda, yadda.
- You know I didn't mean it that way.

29:00.124 --> 29:02.354
I was just tryin' to get in there
before my mom does.

29:03.124 --> 29:05.399
And you know I will do
whatever's clever

29:05.524 --> 29:09.199
to keep the Cheetah Girls on the prowl.

29:10.564 --> 29:13.362
Yes. Thank you very much.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.440
Yes, we will be awaiting your call.

29:15.564 --> 29:18.203
Have a wonderful day. Bye-bye.

29:18.324 --> 29:23.239
Well, she's gonna call us back for a time
on Friday so we can meet Jackal Johnson.

29:23.364 --> 29:26.754
- Oh, yeah, I knew it.
- Cheetah power.

29:26.884 --> 29:31.912
It's all over the school
about your 15 minutes of Jackal fame.

29:32.724 --> 29:35.557
Well, you know, we're very fortunate.

29:35.684 --> 29:38.721
Yeah, while you guys were
crossing paths with Jackal Johnson,

29:38.844 --> 29:42.883
we rushed to a lecture
with the great Wynton Marsalis.

29:43.004 --> 29:46.679
Actually, we couldn't afford tickets, so
we drank mochaccinos across the street.

29:46.804 --> 29:48.556
- Well, I had hot chocolate...
- Wynton came in.

29:48.684 --> 29:51.118
He sat two tables down,
and we exchanged ideas.

29:51.244 --> 29:53.838
No, no, no, man.
You handed him a sugar packet.

29:53.964 --> 29:56.717
Busted. You didn't even
buy the man a coffee?

29:56.844 --> 29:58.243
- Hey, Cheetahs.
- Hey.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.798
Can you guys come by
the newspaper office for an interview?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.676
The Jackal story is front page.

30:02.804 --> 30:05.682
Oh, sure, we are always down
for a photo op.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.843
My man handed Marsalis a sugar packet.
We ain't gonna get no ink?

30:11.124 --> 30:13.433
- Bye.
- He is just so fine.

30:13.564 --> 30:14.997
- Are you crazy?
- Huh?

30:15.124 --> 30:17.877
You know what? If he can't respect
my art, he can't have my heart.

30:18.004 --> 30:19.437
- Whatever.
- Lurk, Momma.

30:19.564 --> 30:21.873
We got front page on the magazine.

30:24.204 --> 30:26.764
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold that down.
- Yeah, Cheetah.

30:26.884 --> 30:28.476
- Hey!
- What?

30:28.604 --> 30:31.118
Now that we're stars,
we need to start acting like it.

30:31.244 --> 30:33.394
And how's that?

30:33.524 --> 30:36.118
Well, stars don't talk
with their mouth full.

30:36.244 --> 30:39.475
And they don't carry bottles of
Hot Papa Sauce in their purses.

30:39.604 --> 30:42.038
Read the label.
Stars that know good food do.

30:42.164 --> 30:45.474
I love New York, but y'all don't know
nothin' about spicin' up no food.

30:45.604 --> 30:49.802
I have to take a little bit of Southern
with me everywhere I go.

30:49.924 --> 30:52.597
Well, Aqua, I have a problem
with your table manners.

30:52.724 --> 30:56.558
You better stash the sauce
next time we see Jackal.

30:56.684 --> 31:00.074
She took my... she...
But she took my hot sauce.

31:00.204 --> 31:03.958
You guys, she's right.
Looks do count.

31:04.084 --> 31:07.156
- I got something on my face? Where?
- Oh, shoot. A little.

31:15.364 --> 31:17.161
"Closed on Saturday"?

31:17.284 --> 31:20.435
We rented the space to the Gold Medal
Crew video people for their auditions.

31:20.564 --> 31:25.558
But I need credit for those hours.
How am I supposed to pay for my lessons?

31:25.684 --> 31:28.039
Help me run the auditions.
I'll credit you for two weeks of lessons.

31:28.164 --> 31:29.802
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:29.924 --> 31:30.561
Great.

31:30.684 --> 31:32.675
Hands up if you know
that you're a star

31:32.804 --> 31:35.398
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

31:35.524 --> 31:38.277
Never give up. Never come too far

31:38.404 --> 31:41.123
Girl power. Girl power

31:41.244 --> 31:43.200
How do you like that, Toto?

31:44.964 --> 31:47.558
I like it, too.

31:47.684 --> 31:49.561
It's going to be our demo.

31:49.684 --> 31:52.960
I'm ready for Jackal.
Hope everybody else is.

31:53.084 --> 31:55.359
Hello, Def Duck Records.
May I help you?

31:57.004 --> 32:00.838
- Yo, what time is it?
- A quarter past time to be on time.

32:00.964 --> 32:02.920
Where is she?

32:06.964 --> 32:10.274
You know, if Dorinda is sitting there in
the same clothes she wears every day,

32:10.404 --> 32:12.634
I think I'm gonna scream.

32:15.444 --> 32:17.560
Do you want to walk?

32:19.604 --> 32:22.755
Always wear comfortable shoes and put
the heels in a bag. Slip 'em on before.

32:22.884 --> 32:25.682
- I've always told you that.
- Right, Mom, right.

32:25.804 --> 32:28.398
There they are. My Cheetah Girls.

32:28.524 --> 32:30.640
Hi.

32:30.764 --> 32:34.279
Galleria's running
a little late, Mr Johnson.

32:34.404 --> 32:40.115
Number one - Mr Johnson's
my father. Call me Jackal.

32:40.244 --> 32:44.362
If this Jackal guy wants just one penny of
you guys' money, he's not the real thing.

32:44.484 --> 32:45.439
Mom, we...

32:45.564 --> 32:48.476
I know these impresario types.
The head of my modelling agency was...

32:48.604 --> 32:51.402
We are just lucky to be in
the same room with Jackal, Mom.

32:51.524 --> 32:54.561
Please don't mama to death. Please.

32:56.644 --> 32:58.521
Sweetheart...

32:58.644 --> 33:01.363
Let me give you
one more piece of advice.

33:01.484 --> 33:04.442
Make the meeting.
Soak your feet later.

33:08.564 --> 33:09.679
Mom, wait up.

33:09.804 --> 33:13.433
Girls, what do you say we
take a tour of your new home,

33:13.564 --> 33:15.873
while we wait for the other divette
to make her entrance?

33:18.084 --> 33:21.201
Mom! Could you please slow down?
I don't want to have sweat.

33:21.324 --> 33:24.919
- That's a bad first impression for Jackal.
- It's business, darling.

33:25.044 --> 33:27.797
I know it's business, Mom. Could you
please slow down? I don't want...

33:27.924 --> 33:29.357
Excuse me, sir.

33:29.484 --> 33:32.044
Please, Mom, please?

33:32.164 --> 33:34.234
I am all about the South.

33:34.364 --> 33:36.320
Spend every summer on my
grandfather's place in Dallas.

33:36.444 --> 33:40.039
- Ooh, there he is.
- Don't mess with Texas.

33:41.204 --> 33:43.764
Jackal Johnson,
I am so sorry that I'm late.

33:43.884 --> 33:47.274
- You should've seen the traffic.
- Yes.

33:47.404 --> 33:49.440
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- I'm sure this can wait.

33:49.564 --> 33:51.794
This is Jackal Johnson.
I'm sure he's a very busy man.

33:51.924 --> 33:54.074
I just hope I haven't missed anything.

33:54.204 --> 33:56.843
Nope. Smells like you
brought it with you.

34:01.924 --> 34:04.040
That's a good one.

34:08.204 --> 34:09.956
Baby.

34:13.244 --> 34:16.202
- It's OK now, Bubbles.
- It's not OK, Chuchie.

34:16.324 --> 34:19.202
This is the most spectacular meeting
of our entire career,

34:19.324 --> 34:22.315
and I walk in this room, and I make
fudgey feet all over the floor?

34:22.444 --> 34:25.163
He's never gonna work with us now.

34:25.284 --> 34:27.478
Galleria, Cheetah Girls
are four people.

34:27.603 --> 34:31.755
I know, I know. But I got to pull it
together. Enough of this puff'n'stuff.

34:31.884 --> 34:36.241
It's showtime, baby. When it boils down,
that's what being a leader is all about.

34:36.364 --> 34:38.831
Thanks for having my back, Chuchie.
You're the one.

34:47.844 --> 34:50.916
Hey, come on over here,
my little poop tracker.

34:51.844 --> 34:54.152
You all good again?

34:54.284 --> 34:56.478
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:56.603 --> 35:00.119
So I guess now we need to
get down to business.

35:00.244 --> 35:02.838
"Business"?
Well, the deal's done.

35:02.964 --> 35:07.913
Aqua here pulled out a bottle of
Hot Papa Hot Sauce, and I was sold.

35:08.684 --> 35:12.836
Well, really?
Aqua, what can I say?

35:12.964 --> 35:14.716
Nothing.

35:14.844 --> 35:18.393
Well, I brought a CD of our song,

35:18.524 --> 35:21.755
and I just want you to listen to it.
My dog Toto says it's a hit.

35:22.524 --> 35:25.800
Really? Oh, that's nice.

35:25.924 --> 35:30.998
And I've got some contracts here for
the mama Cheetah. Standard agreement.

35:41.004 --> 35:43.802
Standard revisions. And then when
I get my lawyer in on this...

35:43.924 --> 35:45.562
Mom. Mom. Mom...

35:45.684 --> 35:48.960
Well... what? Sorry.

35:49.084 --> 35:52.076
Okey-dokey. Well, here's my checklist.

35:52.204 --> 35:55.037
Number one - record a bumping demo.

35:55.164 --> 35:57.962
Number two - have the record people
fall in love with it.

35:58.084 --> 36:00.234
And three - make millions.

36:03.564 --> 36:07.034
- So, who's down with that?
- Oh, yeah.

36:07.164 --> 36:09.917
And how long will it take
to make this bumping demo?

36:10.044 --> 36:12.114
We don't wanna pull
the girls out of school, right?

36:12.244 --> 36:14.075
- You're right.
- So, uh... Schedule.

36:14.204 --> 36:16.434
Schedule.

36:16.564 --> 36:19.362
Let me see.
OK, here's what I'm thinking.

36:19.484 --> 36:22.362
Learn the song Tuesday. Run it
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night.

36:22.484 --> 36:27.194
Rest up, come back in on Saturday,
lay down some tracks.

36:27.324 --> 36:30.316
Less than a week?
These girls need more than one week...

36:30.444 --> 36:33.083
- Mama, no, we don't.
- And then they have to...

36:33.204 --> 36:35.877
- They have to tweak it...
- Mom, no.

36:36.004 --> 36:40.282
Well, you've got to grab each voice, and
then digitise it in real time. It's a lot to do.

36:40.404 --> 36:43.237
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Down, down, Mama Cheetah.

36:43.364 --> 36:47.277
This is just one teensy-weensy little
demo. It's not a soundtrack album.

36:48.884 --> 36:52.194
All I need is one clean take, and then
the bells and whistles happen right here.

36:52.324 --> 36:55.282
So... Saturday?

36:55.404 --> 36:59.682
- Oh! Our school talent show.
- Don't even worry about that.

36:59.804 --> 37:02.921
- We'll be here.
- That's what I like to hear.

37:04.404 --> 37:06.998
Fresh! Bam!
Off the Cheetah-meter.

37:07.124 --> 37:09.843
Yeah, and now the talent show's
down the drain.

37:09.964 --> 37:12.194
Hey, don't worry about it.
Drinka will understand.

37:12.324 --> 37:16.112
I hope you all know you're not singing
a note until my lawyer looks over this.

37:16.244 --> 37:18.200
Mom, things were different
back in your day, OK?

37:18.324 --> 37:21.077
If Jackal says we're ready,
then we must be ready.

37:21.204 --> 37:23.843
My day, your day -
a snake is still a snake.

37:25.804 --> 37:27.524
Where she gettin' them glasses from?

37:27.524 --> 37:28.957
Where she gettin' them glasses from?

37:30.004 --> 37:32.234
This week has been crazy, Julia.

37:32.364 --> 37:35.834
But I promise you will get your time
with the Cheetah Girls.

37:35.964 --> 37:40.594
We trust you'll get our story right, but I will
need photo sign-off. You understand.

37:41.524 --> 37:46.473
And I promise you will be short-listed
as soon as the movie deal comes along.

37:46.604 --> 37:48.560
- "Movie"?
- And it will.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.640
I'll sign this for you later.

37:55.764 --> 37:58.198
That's what he said. Jackal is...

37:58.324 --> 37:59.677
- Would you sign this?
- Yeah.

38:02.684 --> 38:08.600
He just cracked me up. I know. Jackal
does that all the time. It's so annoying.

38:09.684 --> 38:12.323
And the caller ID beeped, and guess...
Where you going? Sit back down.

38:12.444 --> 38:13.763
Sit back down. Sit back down.

38:13.884 --> 38:17.763
And the caller ID beeped, and guess
who it was? It was Jackal! It was Jackal!

38:20.004 --> 38:23.599
Wait. Come back.
I was telling you... Is it over?

38:25.524 --> 38:27.799
- Yo, what's the story?
- It's not our story.

38:27.924 --> 38:30.996
It's Galleria's. And it's written
all over the walls.

38:35.204 --> 38:37.957
"Sick of Cheetah?
Click on ChompCheetah. Com"?

38:38.084 --> 38:40.757
We have a bashing site?

38:40.884 --> 38:43.478
Yo, it's really kind of funny
how people are so jealous.

38:43.604 --> 38:48.200
Jealous? You don't even get it.
Galleria's over the top.

38:48.324 --> 38:53.034
Look, I know she's tough, but she believes
in what we're doing, and you gotta...

38:53.164 --> 38:56.952
Yeah, save it for your book, Chanel.
We live here, and we go to school here.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.281
She's making it really hard
to wear Cheetah spots.

39:00.404 --> 39:03.760
Look, all I'm saying is
someone needs to talk to her.

39:03.884 --> 39:07.479
And when I say "somebody"
I mean you.

39:08.604 --> 39:11.914
I will.
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to her.

39:15.284 --> 39:18.720
When the time is right,
I'll talk to her.

39:22.604 --> 39:27.234
...and then I was like "Dude, relax."
And he's all...

39:28.644 --> 39:31.522
And I fed him some worms, is all.
We don't really hang out much any more.

39:31.644 --> 39:34.522
Anyway, uh, and before I go,
I just want to say my mother...

39:34.644 --> 39:38.796
Rick, you only get three minutes.
Always leave them laughing.

39:39.724 --> 39:41.954
All right, girls,
let's get this rehearsal started.

39:43.484 --> 39:46.760
Actually, Drinka, I would like to
rehearse our new song first.

39:46.884 --> 39:51.594
No. Honey, you got to boogie-oogie-oogie
through the number for your talent show.

39:51.724 --> 39:55.160
Oh. Drinka, you know we met
with Jackal on Monday, right?

39:55.284 --> 39:57.559
Mm-hm.
I heard it through the grapevine.

39:57.684 --> 40:02.553
Well, he wants us to record
our new song on Saturday.

40:04.084 --> 40:07.121
You're not doing the talent show?

40:07.244 --> 40:09.439
Well, you know, I'm gonna
try my best to be there.

40:09.564 --> 40:13.239
But, hey, you know how
these things go, Drinka.

40:13.364 --> 40:16.117
No, I don't know. Why don't you
tell me how they go?

40:16.244 --> 40:19.919
Wait a second. Drinka, I thought
you would be happy for us.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.433
I mean, you're the one who
hooked us up in the first place.

40:22.564 --> 40:25.032
Jackal is just here, you know,
to get our stuff out.

40:26.364 --> 40:29.959
It's kind of like we already won
the talent show, isn't it? Right?

40:31.004 --> 40:36.032
No. Not really.
But you don't know that.

40:36.164 --> 40:38.473
Opportunity's knocking, Drinka.

40:38.604 --> 40:43.200
And I think you know better than I that
once it's gone, you just can't get it back.

40:48.324 --> 40:51.077
Right, right.

40:51.204 --> 40:53.274
You know what?

40:53.404 --> 40:56.714
All I have is this school,

40:56.844 --> 41:00.803
you kids, and my word.

41:00.924 --> 41:03.996
And, sweetie,
I always keep my word.

41:06.124 --> 41:08.354
Come on, boys, you're up.

41:15.204 --> 41:17.195
Yo, Galleria, that was really harsh.

41:17.324 --> 41:18.916
Fine. Then you call Jackal.

41:19.044 --> 41:22.161
"Jackal, we can't do the tour
because we've got a talent show."

41:22.284 --> 41:25.594
Well, are we going to do it or not?
Because I've got somewhere to be.

41:25.724 --> 41:28.477
Then go on, Dorinda.
We're gonna be doing music anyway,

41:28.604 --> 41:31.402
so, since you mostly dance...

41:34.884 --> 41:39.833
You know what? You're right.
That is what I mostly do.

41:40.884 --> 41:43.398
Ugh. Whatever.

41:43.524 --> 41:48.439
Oh, girl, wait. I got you something.
Wait a second, Dorinda. Look at this.

41:48.564 --> 41:51.078
I got you these cute
little clippings of outfits,

41:51.204 --> 41:53.115
which you could probably put together

41:53.244 --> 41:55.883
and hook it up for the next time
we see Jackal.

41:58.484 --> 42:00.952
Hey, Do.

42:01.084 --> 42:03.882
Take it. Because it's not optional.

42:07.044 --> 42:09.194
And, uh...

42:09.324 --> 42:13.681
where exactly are you gonna go get your
personality makeover? Because I forgot...

42:13.804 --> 42:19.322
Hold it down with the whack attack, Do.
We love you. OK?

42:19.444 --> 42:23.517
We just don't want you to look torn up
and chanky next time you see Jackal.

42:23.644 --> 42:26.033
- Torn up?
- Yeah.

42:26.164 --> 42:30.123
How about this for torn up?

42:33.404 --> 42:38.034
Whoa. Some people just don't know
how they're coming off to others.

42:38.164 --> 42:40.280
She'll thank me in the long run.

42:40.404 --> 42:41.996
Yeah.

42:46.044 --> 42:48.035
Miss Chanel?

42:48.164 --> 42:51.201
The time is now.

42:52.884 --> 42:56.274
All right, let's take it from the top.
Remember, it's supposed to be fun.

42:56.404 --> 42:59.555
Like a day at the park. So let me see
lots of smiles, lots of energy.

42:59.684 --> 43:02.073
All right. Let me get the first group.
Come on, here we go.

43:02.284 --> 43:05.196
- All right, pick it up.
- Don't lose your spot.

43:07.364 --> 43:08.843
That's good.

43:08.964 --> 43:10.795
Come on.

43:12.484 --> 43:14.679
Don't get lost.
Keep up with it.

43:14.804 --> 43:15.998
- Ha!
- Ooh, yes.

43:16.124 --> 43:19.799
That's what I'm talking about. Keep it
clean, keep it short. Have some fun.

43:19.924 --> 43:23.553
- Hit it.
- That's nice. Harder. Hit it. Hit it.

43:25.604 --> 43:29.722
All right. Yeah, there we go.
Watch her. She's got it.

43:30.644 --> 43:35.513
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, jump. Get up.

43:35.644 --> 43:37.839
Yeah, OK. Next group, come on.

43:41.004 --> 43:42.835
Watch that elbow.

43:44.764 --> 43:46.675
Pick it up. Come on, you guys.
Come on.

43:46.804 --> 43:49.443
- What's the name of that dancer?
- That's Dorinda. Yeah.

43:49.564 --> 43:52.124
She's pretty good.
I like what I'm seeing. OK.

43:52.244 --> 43:54.599
Pick it up. All right.

43:57.324 --> 44:00.521
That's good. Let's stop a minute.
Cut the music. All right. Everyone stop.

44:00.644 --> 44:02.316
Very nice.
That's good enough for today.

44:02.444 --> 44:05.880
Guys, just hang out for a second.
I'm going to let you go shortly.

44:07.844 --> 44:11.678
All right, all right. Give me a minute,
I gotta talk to someone.

44:11.804 --> 44:15.353
Hey, Dorinda. Hey, you were
working hard out there, you know?

44:15.484 --> 44:19.159
- Good job, good job. You look great.
- I'm glad I could help.

44:19.284 --> 44:22.481
Listen. There are a few parts
in this show you'd be perfect for.

44:22.604 --> 44:24.674
Think about coming on tour
with us this summer.

44:24.804 --> 44:29.161
- Me, on tour with the Gold Medal Crew?
- That's right. Ten weeks.

44:29.284 --> 44:32.321
There are other kids in this show and
it's like summer camp, but you get paid.

44:32.444 --> 44:33.957
Wait. You get paid?

44:34.084 --> 44:38.635
Girl, you dance like a pro, you get paid like
a pro. Have your parents take a look at this.

44:38.764 --> 44:43.235
- If they say yes, return it to me.
- My parents? OK, all right.

44:43.364 --> 44:44.797
- Good.
- I'll get back to you.

44:44.924 --> 44:46.721
The following people,
thank you very much.

44:46.844 --> 44:49.802
- We're going to come back to this, OK?
- Oh, man.

44:49.924 --> 44:51.516
Ma?

44:51.684 --> 44:52.912
Ma?

44:53.044 --> 44:55.353
I'm feeling shoe shoppy.

44:58.324 --> 45:01.282
I knew it was too good to be true.

45:02.964 --> 45:08.084
"Luc surprised me with tickets to a
Broadway show, so I couldn't say no."

45:08.204 --> 45:11.241
"You take my card
and have a good time."

45:11.364 --> 45:15.437
"Get something we both can wear
and look tight. Love, Mommy."

45:18.404 --> 45:21.476
"We need to spend more time together."

45:21.604 --> 45:22.923
Yeah, right.

45:23.044 --> 45:25.956
Nobody's home.
Nobody's ever home.

45:27.524 --> 45:30.960
Hey, we're not here. Leave your name
and number after the beep.

45:31.084 --> 45:33.359
Nita, Gail from Moving On Realtors.

45:33.484 --> 45:36.044
If you still want to put your
apartment up for sale, give a shout.

45:36.164 --> 45:38.041
We'll do an open house.

45:38.164 --> 45:42.954
Here's a shout. You can send
that one right back, special delivery.

45:43.084 --> 45:45.996
No one's moving out.

45:48.764 --> 45:51.801
Oh, yeah. I'll have a good time.

46:29.764 --> 46:32.881
- Hi. The Thomases, please.
- There's no Thomases here.

46:33.884 --> 46:35.875
Really?

46:36.004 --> 46:38.916
Dorinda Thomas. About this tall,
always has, like, a dance bag with her?

46:39.044 --> 46:43.640
Oh, her. Take the alley around.
Superintendent's apartment.

46:46.604 --> 46:47.832
"Alley"?

47:13.324 --> 47:15.713
Hello?

47:16.444 --> 47:19.004
- I told y'all to stop running in the house.
- Come here.

47:19.124 --> 47:21.843
I'm looking for Dorinda Thomas,
but I must have the wrong...

47:21.964 --> 47:24.683
No, no. She's here. Dorinda?

47:25.644 --> 47:27.521
You got a visitor, honey.

47:27.644 --> 47:30.795
- Hey, Chanel.
- Hey.

47:31.644 --> 47:34.681
Mom, this is my friend Chanel. Remember,
I told you about the Cheetah Girls?

47:34.804 --> 47:36.396
Oh, yeah. Hi, honey.

47:36.524 --> 47:38.242
Hi.

47:39.764 --> 47:44.360
What did y'all break this time?
Nice to meet you, honey.

47:44.484 --> 47:47.157
Dorinda, let's go see
somebody get in trouble.

47:47.284 --> 47:50.321
You go ahead.
I'll be right there, OK?

47:55.364 --> 47:58.561
If I knew you were coming, I'd have been
really rich and lived somewhere else.

47:58.684 --> 47:59.719
What?

47:59.844 --> 48:04.964
Now you know why I never invite
you guys over or talk about my family.

48:05.084 --> 48:08.759
I'm really surprised at you, Dorinda.
Why'd you try to hide it?

48:08.884 --> 48:13.162
You guys are all... I don't know.
I guess I just didn't think about it.

48:13.284 --> 48:16.082
Wait till I tell Galleria.
I mean, the way you dance,

48:16.204 --> 48:19.480
you had to have some flavour in you
somewhere. But she was all "No"...

48:19.604 --> 48:21.913
We're not talking about
the same thing, Chanel.

48:22.044 --> 48:25.559
So you're half Black.
You've seen Galleria's mom and dad.

48:25.684 --> 48:27.993
And I'm a little bit
of every kind of Spanish pepper, girl.

48:28.124 --> 48:30.513
Shoot, Miss America
has ten bloodlines.

48:30.644 --> 48:32.635
No. No!

48:32.764 --> 48:36.154
Yo, we're all mixed up in this jiggy jungle
together. Join the club, girlie.

48:36.284 --> 48:38.593
Can you just wait for a second?

48:38.724 --> 48:40.715
I'm not Black, and I'm not half Black.

48:40.844 --> 48:43.312
I'm not even White.
I don't even know what I am.

48:43.444 --> 48:46.880
I do know that Mrs Bosco isn't my mom.

48:47.004 --> 48:49.802
She's the closest thing I've ever had.

48:51.364 --> 48:55.562
My mom, my real mom,
she didn't want me.

48:55.684 --> 49:00.155
And I'm a foster child,
and I live here with ten other kids.

49:01.884 --> 49:06.275
The only reason why we even get to live
here is because Mr Bosco's the super.

49:07.124 --> 49:11.197
But I want to stay here,
and I want to stay here with my friends,

49:11.324 --> 49:13.963
and in school,
and with the Cheetah Girls,

49:14.084 --> 49:17.963
because it's the best I've ever had,
Chanel. And please don't...

49:18.084 --> 49:20.757
Don't take it from me.

49:21.764 --> 49:25.916
Girl, you thought we'd pull your card
for lack of parents?

49:27.084 --> 49:29.757
Girl, sometimes that
can be a good thing.

49:29.884 --> 49:33.672
Trust me, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.876
You should be grateful
that you have a mom.

49:39.644 --> 49:43.762
Do, you're a Cheetah Girl because of
who you are, and what's in your heart.

49:44.764 --> 49:47.039
And you're pure Cheetah Girl.

49:52.604 --> 49:54.595
Look at us.

49:58.364 --> 50:01.162
- You didn't come here to hear my secret.
- Nah.

50:01.284 --> 50:03.559
So why are you here?

50:04.084 --> 50:08.396
I felt really bad about
what happened with Galleria.

50:08.524 --> 50:13.279
She gets all testy and touchy cos
she wants everything to be perfect.

50:13.404 --> 50:15.554
I just wanted to make sure you were OK.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.995
- Do, come and eat.
- I'll be there in a second.

50:22.364 --> 50:24.673
I'm all right. I just...

50:24.804 --> 50:27.876
I can't look the way she wants me to.

50:28.004 --> 50:31.121
I don't have money to buy a new outfit.

50:31.244 --> 50:34.361
Or you could wear this.

50:34.484 --> 50:37.999
I saw it and I thought one of us
had to have it. Check it out.

50:41.444 --> 50:42.877
Wow.

50:43.004 --> 50:44.995
Growl power.

50:45.124 --> 50:47.194
It's hot.

50:47.324 --> 50:50.600
Just think of it as a loan
from the Juanita-Chanel collection.

50:51.204 --> 50:53.354
Thanks, girl.

50:57.524 --> 51:00.675
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

51:00.804 --> 51:02.681
- What's wrong? You OK?
- Yeah.

51:02.804 --> 51:06.353
I'm great, actually. I mean...

51:06.484 --> 51:10.079
I got an offer from the Gold Medal Crew.
They want me to dance for them.

51:10.204 --> 51:13.833
- They wanna hire me, Chanel.
- Oh, my God. Get out, girl.

51:13.964 --> 51:16.683
I know. But...

51:20.564 --> 51:24.876
- What about the Cheetah Girls?
- I don't know.

51:25.484 --> 51:27.918
Chanel, I really need that money.

51:28.044 --> 51:30.319
I just... I don't know what to do.

51:34.164 --> 51:36.758
- Come on, now, stay still.
- Hey. Ow.

51:36.884 --> 51:38.795
Sorry. OK, wait. One more.

51:38.924 --> 51:41.757
- OK. Sorry about that.
- Not so much arch, girl.

51:41.884 --> 51:46.400
I don't want to look like "The Mary J Blige
concert tickets are sold out?"

51:46.524 --> 51:49.436
I know, right? Wait, watch out.
Let me do this one.

51:49.564 --> 51:53.876
From furry to fierce. Girl, they are
cheetahlicious. Aren't they, Toto?

51:55.044 --> 51:57.160
Come in. Hey, Mom.

51:57.284 --> 51:59.002
Galleria's Day Spa.

52:00.124 --> 52:03.002
Now, listen, I do not want you all
to stay up all night gabbing.

52:03.124 --> 52:04.842
- OK.
- And, uh...

52:04.964 --> 52:09.242
I made a decision that you all
can go to this rehearsal alone.

52:10.084 --> 52:12.439
Oh, Mom. Thank you so much.

52:12.564 --> 52:14.714
I just want to see how
you handle yourselves.

52:14.844 --> 52:16.436
- OK.
- I'm trusting you.

52:16.564 --> 52:19.442
- Thanks, Madrina.
- You're welcome.

52:19.564 --> 52:23.352
Toto? Get to bed,
and be an example for these girls.

52:23.484 --> 52:25.122
Good night. Go to sleep.

52:25.244 --> 52:26.962
- OK, OK, OK.
- All right. Love you.

52:27.084 --> 52:28.563
- Love ya.
- Love you, too.

52:28.684 --> 52:31.244
- Chanel, I wanted to show you something.
- What?

52:32.604 --> 52:36.563
What do you think about this?

52:41.044 --> 52:43.763
- Don't you think there's something wrong?
- What?

52:43.884 --> 52:49.800
Why is there one person in the middle,
and why is that one person you?

52:49.924 --> 52:52.836
OK, yeah. My picture is bigger
than everybody else's.

52:52.964 --> 52:55.478
- But hey, I did write the songs.
- Hold up.

52:55.604 --> 52:59.483
Those were my ideas too, and Aqua
freestyled a lot of the hooks you used.

52:59.604 --> 53:01.720
Those were our songs.

53:01.844 --> 53:05.837
Chanel, I take bits and pieces and put
them together, OK? I'm an artist.

53:05.964 --> 53:08.922
And while you're being an artist
and taking your bows, what am I?

53:09.044 --> 53:12.116
- Your sidekick? Your flunky?
- Hey, calm down, Chanel. OK?

53:12.244 --> 53:14.519
Can we just stay focused
on the dream, please?

53:14.644 --> 53:16.635
Bubbles, stop trying to
handle me, all right?

53:16.764 --> 53:20.393
I wasn't born to be wiping your shoes,
to go along with your okey-doke, OK?

53:20.524 --> 53:23.596
I'm not the only one feeling it.
Aqua and Do are feeling it, too.

53:23.724 --> 53:27.319
What? The Cheetah Girls are opening
the box behind my back?

53:27.444 --> 53:30.675
No. You just don't see it when
it's all up in your face, girl.

53:30.804 --> 53:35.355
Look, Bubbles, you're not
that much fun to be around any more.

53:37.244 --> 53:40.520
I know. OK? But I promise, girl.

53:40.644 --> 53:45.081
Everybody will be so happy once we
get this deal tomorrow. Trust me.

53:46.084 --> 53:50.555
Yo, Bubbles, I found out why
Do keeps her life on the DL.

53:50.684 --> 53:54.996
She's a foster child. Her mom gave her
away when she was just a baby.

53:55.124 --> 53:58.639
- What?
- Yeah.

53:58.764 --> 54:02.074
This is no dream, all right?
This is the real deal for her.

54:02.284 --> 54:04.275
I guess she needs this
more than anybody, huh?

54:04.404 --> 54:08.761
No, Bubbles. What she needs is friends.
We all do.

54:11.764 --> 54:16.838
Chuchie, friends help friends
make their dream come true, right?

54:16.964 --> 54:21.196
- I guess.
- Then don't worry about it, girl. OK?

54:21.324 --> 54:25.715
I'm sure Jackal will have some ideas
about the cover tomorrow. So don't trip.

54:33.844 --> 54:35.800
Cheetah Girls.

54:35.924 --> 54:43.080
I have some ideas, and so does
my marketing team. Give a listen.

54:43.204 --> 54:47.755
Our research shows your demographic
responds to the animal theme

54:47.884 --> 54:51.763
and your bouncy, up-tempo,
pop-urban sensibility.

54:51.884 --> 54:55.354
Kids love endangered species.
Kids wanna party.

54:55.484 --> 55:00.717
Kids want a band like Global Getdown.

55:00.844 --> 55:03.802
The letter "G" is big this year.

55:03.924 --> 55:07.963
Galleria stays a cheetah
now and forever.

55:09.324 --> 55:15.320
Dorinda is a sweet panda.
Come on, take it.

55:15.444 --> 55:22.043
Here we have a baby seal for...

55:22.164 --> 55:24.758
Aqua, of course.

55:24.884 --> 55:30.083
And Chanel is a snow leopard
from the frigid north.

55:31.604 --> 55:34.641
- Brr. Ha ha.
- Masks?

55:34.764 --> 55:38.803
Our engineering department
wants to create whole new identities.

55:39.604 --> 55:42.721
So you guys want us to be, like,
something other than the Cheetah Girls?

55:42.844 --> 55:47.076
Global Getdown
is a worldwide marketing miracle.

55:47.204 --> 55:50.833
I'm seeing dolls, movie tie-ins
with every kind of burger, taco,

55:50.964 --> 55:53.398
and anything you can eat
with chopsticks.

55:53.524 --> 55:57.802
Well, how does it look?

55:57.924 --> 55:59.755
- Oh, precious.
- Sweet.

55:59.884 --> 56:04.480
Dorinda, take that thing off.
Jackal, um...

56:04.604 --> 56:07.801
We can't sing in these things.

56:07.924 --> 56:11.599
Well, you'll be miked inside.
And the music's on tape, anyway.

56:11.724 --> 56:16.479
- Oh, I'm sorry. We don't lip sync.
- Don't worry.

56:16.604 --> 56:20.882
We'll teach you. Now, let's talk music.

56:21.004 --> 56:24.280
Ha, now you're talking.
Cheetahs, "Girl Power".

56:25.124 --> 56:27.479
- Excuse me.
- Bump this.

56:28.604 --> 56:30.879
Let's do this, girls.

56:32.644 --> 56:35.078
Chuck those masks right there, please.

56:42.404 --> 56:44.440
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

56:44.564 --> 56:47.362
You'd better stand up
if you know just who you are

56:47.484 --> 56:50.078
Never give up. Never say die

56:50.204 --> 56:52.718
Girl power. Girl power

56:52.844 --> 56:54.835
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

56:54.964 --> 56:57.524
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

56:57.644 --> 57:00.283
Never give up. Never come too far

57:00.404 --> 57:03.202
Girl power. Girl power

57:03.324 --> 57:06.396
I made mistakes before

57:06.524 --> 57:09.641
But I know I'm not perfect

57:09.764 --> 57:14.280
It's OK cos who could ever be?

57:14.404 --> 57:16.872
As long as I give my best

57:17.004 --> 57:19.199
It won't matter what no one says

57:19.324 --> 57:23.237
Cos down in my heart I got
the power to make it all happen. Yeah

57:23.364 --> 57:26.436
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star...

57:26.564 --> 57:28.236
All the same thing

57:28.364 --> 57:30.878
Never give up. Never say die

57:31.004 --> 57:33.882
Girl power. Girl power

57:34.004 --> 57:37.519
At times I may just feel like

57:37.644 --> 57:39.635
My back is to the wall

57:39.764 --> 57:41.959
I hold my head up high

57:42.084 --> 57:45.076
And keep standing tall

57:45.204 --> 57:47.843
I know that my back is covered

57:47.964 --> 57:50.398
Because we have each other

57:50.524 --> 57:53.721
And we're down for whatever
if you hear me

57:53.844 --> 57:56.199
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

57:56.324 --> 57:58.679
You'd better stand up
if you know just who you are

57:58.804 --> 58:01.716
Never give up. Never say die

58:01.844 --> 58:04.074
Girl power. Girl power

58:04.204 --> 58:08.117
Sometimes life may get you down

58:08.244 --> 58:10.997
But you better hold your ground

58:11.124 --> 58:15.515
Can't nobody live your life but you

58:15.684 --> 58:18.357
Stay true to who you are

58:18.484 --> 58:20.998
And always follow your heart

58:21.124 --> 58:25.515
Your heart. Your heart

58:26.924 --> 58:29.358
Throw your hands up
if you know that you're a star

58:29.484 --> 58:32.078
You better stand up
if you know just who you are

58:32.204 --> 58:34.559
Never give up. Never come too far

58:34.684 --> 58:37.881
Girl power. Girl power

58:42.204 --> 58:44.718
Excellent. Excellent.

58:44.844 --> 58:48.917
I loved it. That's exactly the flavour
we're looking for.

58:50.884 --> 58:54.479
Now, here's the song we're looking at.

58:55.084 --> 58:57.279
Hit it.

58:57.404 --> 59:00.999
We go all around the world
Where we stop. Nobody knows...

59:01.124 --> 59:03.763
All right. Check this out.

59:03.884 --> 59:07.957
Def Duck Records presents
Global Getdown - "All Around the World".

59:08.084 --> 59:10.040
This is going to go platinum,
titanium, uranium.

59:10.164 --> 59:13.076
It is animal-friendly, vegetable-friendly,
mineral-friendly.

59:13.204 --> 59:15.240
This is brilliant. I can smell millions.

59:15.364 --> 59:18.959
Oh, yeah. That's it. Ow.
Feel it. Feel it. Come on.

59:19.084 --> 59:22.394
- We go all around the world...
- Oh, yeah. Sing it.

59:22.524 --> 59:25.755
Where we stop. Nobody knows
Cos we don't care just where we go

59:25.884 --> 59:27.158
Pump it.

59:27.284 --> 59:30.754
All around the world
We go all around the world

59:30.884 --> 59:34.081
Where we stop. Nobody knows
but I can't wait to go home

59:34.204 --> 59:35.114
Sing it with me.

59:35.244 --> 59:38.475
All around the world
We go all around the world

59:38.604 --> 59:42.802
Where we stop. Nobody knows
We don't care where we go

59:42.924 --> 59:46.633
All around the world
We go all around the world...

59:50.444 --> 59:52.912
No! No! No! No!

59:53.044 --> 59:57.799
- Didn't you like what we just did?
- I loved it. It was great.

59:57.924 --> 01:00:00.996
But that's not what we sold
the record company.

01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:04.514
Well, I'm sorry. We can't change
the Cheetah Girls.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:08.239
Well, this is what they're interested in.

01:00:08.364 --> 01:00:10.559
And this is what they're paying for.

01:00:11.444 --> 01:00:13.912
Well, fine. Then we bounce.

01:00:22.124 --> 01:00:25.275
- Could you excuse us for a second?
- Sure. Absolutely.

01:00:27.164 --> 01:00:28.836
Let's, uh...

01:00:28.964 --> 01:00:33.674
Let's give these girls a chance
to think about that world tour. Hm?

01:00:33.804 --> 01:00:35.681
All right.

01:00:41.044 --> 01:00:44.719
- Why didn't you guys back me up?
- You mean rubber-stamp you.

01:00:44.844 --> 01:00:47.278
Galleria, you didn't even give us
a chance to think.

01:00:47.404 --> 01:00:49.440
Think about what, Do?
They're puppets.

01:00:49.564 --> 01:00:51.998
I mean, now at least we could be
down for the talent show.

01:00:52.124 --> 01:00:54.558
And if we win,
we can still have our demo.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:58.563
Don't front, Bubbles. Now you're all
gung ho for the talent show?

01:00:58.684 --> 01:01:01.960
Maybe we need to do it this way first,
so we can get our shot.

01:01:02.084 --> 01:01:04.598
He knows the business.
I really think we should consider it.

01:01:04.724 --> 01:01:08.683
It's a job singing, dancing, and making
people happy. What's wrong with that?

01:01:08.804 --> 01:01:13.161
- It's not our music.
- It's not your song, so you wanna walk.

01:01:13.284 --> 01:01:17.118
You didn't handle this.
Now I will.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.280
You're just mad because
he won't do your material, right?

01:01:21.404 --> 01:01:27.036
Our material, not that "All Around the
World" nonsense he was playing.

01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:30.440
You might be right, babe, but you can't
make decisions for the whole group.

01:01:30.564 --> 01:01:33.203
We make our decisions together.

01:01:33.324 --> 01:01:35.918
You're just one person,
and you're not the boss of everything.

01:01:36.044 --> 01:01:37.796
Well, somebody has to be the boss.

01:01:37.924 --> 01:01:40.438
Somebody has to remind you
why we started the Cheetah Girls.

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:42.600
To make our dreams come true.

01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:45.284
Our way, not his.

01:01:45.404 --> 01:01:47.918
Why don't you guys
believe in what we have?

01:01:48.044 --> 01:01:50.638
I wish I could believe in you,
Galleria, I really do,

01:01:50.764 --> 01:01:53.597
but lately you've been all about you.

01:01:56.884 --> 01:01:58.761
I can't...

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.757
We can't trust you any more.

01:02:11.044 --> 01:02:13.797
Oh. OK, well...

01:02:16.364 --> 01:02:20.073
Problem solved.
I'm taking myself out of the equation.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.764
Oh, come on, Galleria.
Will you squash the drama?

01:02:22.884 --> 01:02:26.433
No. Really, Do.
This is your shot.

01:02:26.564 --> 01:02:32.196
And you need this, so I definitely
do not want to stand in your way.

01:02:32.324 --> 01:02:34.884
So you guys are on your own,

01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:38.076
and you take the deal.

01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:56.719
- Did we lose a Cheetah?
- Afraid so.

01:02:57.524 --> 01:03:00.482
Happens all the time. Don't worry.

01:03:00.604 --> 01:03:02.913
There's more where she came from.

01:03:03.044 --> 01:03:06.559
Sure. We can always find another singer.
And then...

01:03:06.684 --> 01:03:10.154
move our other lead singer
to centre mike.

01:03:10.644 --> 01:03:15.115
How about "Chanel
and the Global Getdown"?

01:03:17.404 --> 01:03:19.315
What?

01:03:20.844 --> 01:03:24.678
Look, this is too much for one day.

01:03:24.804 --> 01:03:27.796
I really think we should
all think about this.

01:03:27.924 --> 01:03:33.476
All right. Well, come back
when you're ready for prime time.

01:04:11.644 --> 01:04:13.714
Mom...

01:04:13.844 --> 01:04:17.314
Could you please not say,
"I told you so"?

01:04:18.884 --> 01:04:20.761
Please.

01:04:30.844 --> 01:04:34.678
Hey, Dana.
Looks like I'll be going on that tour.

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:36.920
Hey, great.
They picked me too.

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:39.353
And I got forms for you to fill out.

01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:41.839
You just gotta get
your foster mom to sign them.

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:49.116
Ma, what's up?

01:05:52.404 --> 01:05:54.474
What's up?

01:05:56.284 --> 01:06:00.755
My credit card balance is up,
that's what's up. I got declined.

01:06:00.884 --> 01:06:03.318
I bought some sandals.
I wanted to wear them out of the store.

01:06:03.444 --> 01:06:06.322
The woman snatched them back so fast,
she took the paint off my toes.

01:06:06.444 --> 01:06:10.801
- Why would you do this, huh? Why?
- Ma, I'm sorry.

01:06:13.524 --> 01:06:16.596
Look, I'll give it all back.

01:06:16.724 --> 01:06:21.718
I thought we were gonna be rich
after this demo. I'll work. I'll pay you back.

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:25.439
I trusted you. I trusted you,
and you took advantage of me.

01:06:26.724 --> 01:06:30.717
I trusted you.
I trusted you to pay attention, Ma.

01:06:30.844 --> 01:06:33.517
You did this
because I broke a shopping date?

01:06:33.644 --> 01:06:36.363
No, Ma. No.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:42.602
I did it cos Luc came in the picture, and
it seemed like my dreams didn't matter.

01:06:42.724 --> 01:06:44.760
It seemed like they didn't matter.

01:06:47.804 --> 01:06:51.001
But I've seen what it's like
not to have a mom.

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:55.436
What?

01:06:57.604 --> 01:07:02.120
Calm down, calm down,
calm down. Hey.

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.844
- Who doesn't have a mom?
- I'll tell you later.

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:12.197
I just wanted to thank you
for always keeping me in your dreams.

01:07:13.324 --> 01:07:18.273
- Oh, baby.
- No matter where they take us.

01:07:18.404 --> 01:07:24.195
Paris, Buenos Aires -
it doesn't matter any more.

01:07:24.324 --> 01:07:30.081
- The Cheetah Girls are over.
- Oh, baby, no, no, no.

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:37.156
I worked on all the songs.
I worked on our look.

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:41.118
I buckled everything down. I thought that
we were all on the same page.

01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:43.360
I am sure you did what was right.

01:07:43.484 --> 01:07:46.601
But what's right for you
may not be right for someone else.

01:07:46.724 --> 01:07:48.794
And it's not worth
losing a friendship over.

01:07:48.924 --> 01:07:51.677
How could we be friends again?

01:07:51.804 --> 01:07:53.681
I mean, they want fame.

01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:57.843
And there are ways...
and then there are ways.

01:07:57.964 --> 01:08:00.717
And I want fame the Cheetah Girls way.

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:03.802
The Cheetah Girls way or your way?

01:08:03.924 --> 01:08:08.361
We worked too hard to give it up.
I have to stand up for what's right.

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:13.000
Oh, sweetheart. I tried so hard to protect
you from getting your dreams crushed.

01:08:13.124 --> 01:08:17.675
But there's no way I could
save you from this heartache.

01:08:17.804 --> 01:08:21.796
You see, sometimes
you just have to let go.

01:08:22.684 --> 01:08:27.121
And let the people you love
make their own choices.

01:08:27.243 --> 01:08:32.318
Even if you don't agree with them.
You see, I'm learning to do that with you.

01:08:33.524 --> 01:08:36.357
And you've gotta learn with your friends.

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.474
What difference does it make?

01:08:40.604 --> 01:08:43.960
You either walk with the devil,
or you don't.

01:08:44.084 --> 01:08:46.917
And I said no.

01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:49.080
And I was right.

01:08:51.363 --> 01:08:54.720
I was... I was right, wasn't I?

01:09:35.608 --> 01:09:39.078
Someone's always

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:42.837
There behind

01:09:42.968 --> 01:09:49.805
To catch us if we fall

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:55.366
I might be lonely

01:09:56.448 --> 01:10:01.841
But I'm not...

01:10:11.008 --> 01:10:15.081
No, keep going.
It wasn't entirely all that bad.

01:10:15.568 --> 01:10:19.607
It actually sounded like something,
not that pop fluff you're usually working.

01:10:19.728 --> 01:10:22.196
- You liked it?
- Yeah.

01:10:22.328 --> 01:10:24.967
You had somebody write you
a Cheetah jam?

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:28.160
No. I wrote it. And all by myself.

01:10:30.408 --> 01:10:33.878
See, this is the kind of music
Jackal Johnson didn't want us to record.

01:10:34.008 --> 01:10:37.887
He had other ideas for us.
Like this. Listen to this.

01:10:38.008 --> 01:10:41.398
We go all around the world
We go all around the world

01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:44.565
Where we stop nobody knows
We don't care...

01:10:44.688 --> 01:10:46.644
OK.

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:54.637
It was drama and kaflamma.

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:56.645
There were masks involved.

01:10:58.368 --> 01:11:01.280
When he asked us to lip sync,

01:11:01.408 --> 01:11:03.603
I walked.

01:11:03.728 --> 01:11:05.923
So it's true, huh?

01:11:06.048 --> 01:11:08.721
No more Cheetahs in the jungle?

01:11:10.488 --> 01:11:14.037
The Cheetahs are extinct.

01:11:14.168 --> 01:11:16.602
Oh, I should not be laughing right now.

01:11:16.728 --> 01:11:19.288
Well, welcome to the world
of a true artist.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.764
You really do have to
walk alone sometimes.

01:11:22.888 --> 01:11:26.198
But you got the talent,
and you can walk it.

01:11:29.408 --> 01:11:32.718
Wait a second. You aren't just saying that
cos now you can win the talent show?

01:11:32.848 --> 01:11:34.884
Yes, I am.

01:11:35.688 --> 01:11:39.044
Well, not completely.

01:11:55.448 --> 01:11:57.757
Come on, honey.

01:11:57.888 --> 01:12:02.404
So, I thought we'd spend this evening
cuddled up family-style.

01:12:02.488 --> 01:12:05.446
Papa will make a delicious supper.

01:12:05.568 --> 01:12:08.401
Maybe we could
pop in your favourite movie.

01:12:08.528 --> 01:12:12.919
"There's no place like home."
There's no place like home, booby.

01:12:13.048 --> 01:12:17.087
Well, I don't even think
The Wizard of Oz can fix this, Mom.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:22.566
I was thinking Toto and I could go to the
talent show, show Drinka some support.

01:12:22.688 --> 01:12:25.919
- That's wonderful, honey.
- OK.

01:12:26.048 --> 01:12:30.405
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks. See ya.

01:12:31.528 --> 01:12:33.678
Come on.

01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:03.961
They... they went ahead without me.

01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:07.044
Toto, can you believe that?
The Cheetah Girls...

01:13:07.168 --> 01:13:10.877
Toto! Toto, come here. Toto!

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:14.124
Toto, stop!

01:13:14.248 --> 01:13:16.443
Toto!

01:13:16.568 --> 01:13:19.924
Wait! Toto! Toto!

01:13:23.008 --> 01:13:24.839
Toto...

01:13:24.968 --> 01:13:26.162
Toto?

01:13:26.288 --> 01:13:28.643
Oh, Toto!

01:13:31.368 --> 01:13:35.964
What's going on, Manhattan Magnet?
Yeah! Come on.

01:13:36.088 --> 01:13:39.125
Hey, give yourself a hand. Hello.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.204
Is everybody ready
to have a good time?

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:46.597
Pick up the phone.
It'll be OK.

01:13:46.728 --> 01:13:48.844
Hey, Mom, Dad.

01:13:48.968 --> 01:13:52.085
Dad, listen to me, please.
Toto is in a hole.

01:13:52.848 --> 01:13:55.646
Oh, Mr Police Officer.
Please. My dog is in a hole.

01:13:55.768 --> 01:14:00.046
- Will you please go and get him?
- Dog in a hole? That's bad.

01:14:02.448 --> 01:14:04.166
- I'm gonna have to call for backup.
- OK.

01:14:04.288 --> 01:14:08.247
Unit 15. I got a dog in a hole
by Manhattan Magnet.

01:14:08.368 --> 01:14:10.836
...who calls himself a bird person.
You know, he flips out,

01:14:10.968 --> 01:14:15.086
and he starts flapping his wings.
I'm like "Dude, relax." And he's all...

01:14:20.528 --> 01:14:23.645
That's it. Come on. Come on.
A little to the left. Keep going.

01:14:24.288 --> 01:14:27.837
To the left. To the left.
OK, OK, there he is.

01:14:27.968 --> 01:14:30.243
He's got himself wedged in there good.

01:14:30.368 --> 01:14:34.156
It's OK, Toto. They're coming to get you,
OK? Don't worry. Why isn't he barking?

01:14:34.288 --> 01:14:37.883
We got some oxygen to him.
He's gonna be OK until we figure this out.

01:14:39.568 --> 01:14:42.036
- Galleria!
- Mom! Dad!

01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:45.604
Excuse me, sir. Those are my parents.
Excuse me. They can come in.

01:14:48.528 --> 01:14:52.237
Three, two, one.
Hal Hartman here

01:14:52.368 --> 01:14:54.757
in downtown,
where we're getting to the bottom

01:14:54.888 --> 01:14:57.686
of the traffic jam
that's paralysing midtown.

01:14:57.808 --> 01:15:01.767
Apparently
Toto is not in Kansas any more.

01:15:02.528 --> 01:15:05.201
Ma, look.

01:15:05.328 --> 01:15:08.126
Wait. You look like...

01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:10.478
Don't tell anybody where
you get your hair done.

01:15:10.608 --> 01:15:15.318
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, Sonic Chaos.

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.607
- Hey, yo, Max?
- Yeah?

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.958
- I don't think they ready for this.
- No, no.

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:29.398
C'mon. Yo. All I want is one beat.
One song. One rhyme

01:15:29.528 --> 01:15:31.803
Just one verse with one line. One time

01:15:31.928 --> 01:15:33.520
Cos I'm here to spread the word

01:15:33.648 --> 01:15:35.798
It ain't what you see. Yo.
It's what you heard

01:15:35.928 --> 01:15:37.156
- So c'mon
- C'mon

01:15:37.288 --> 01:15:38.323
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:15:38.448 --> 01:15:40.564
It don't matter who you are.
Just c'mon

01:15:40.688 --> 01:15:42.201
White. Black. Brown.
Puerto Rican or Haitian

01:15:42.328 --> 01:15:44.319
It don't matter who you are.
We one hip-hop nation

01:15:44.448 --> 01:15:45.961
- So c'mon
- C'mon

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:46.759
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:15:46.888 --> 01:15:48.924
If you're likin' what we're sayin'
then c'mon

01:15:49.048 --> 01:15:51.004
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

01:15:51.128 --> 01:15:52.880
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing...

01:16:02.528 --> 01:16:04.246
Excuse me.

01:16:04.368 --> 01:16:06.836
Mr and Mrs Garibaldi, how's Toto?

01:16:06.968 --> 01:16:09.766
- How'd you know?
- Well, you're all over the news.

01:16:09.888 --> 01:16:13.437
Well, how did you get down here?
I mean, the streets are totally blocked.

01:16:19.328 --> 01:16:23.321
Aqua, did you take the subway for me?

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:28.042
I took the subway for Toto. I'm from Texas.
We learn from the Rangers.

01:16:28.168 --> 01:16:32.161
We never leave a man or a dog behind.
Hang in there, baby boy.

01:16:36.688 --> 01:16:39.521
- Do!
- Hey, is he OK?

01:16:41.008 --> 01:16:42.999
Oh, no, he doesn't look good.

01:16:44.568 --> 01:16:48.243
- Go, go, go!
- Excuse me. Coming through.

01:16:48.368 --> 01:16:50.677
- We need to get through.
- Over there.

01:16:50.808 --> 01:16:52.480
- Chuchie!
- Thank you.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:55.168
- Honey, go.
- Oh, thanks for coming.

01:16:55.888 --> 01:16:59.005
How did this happen?
Did you let him off the leash?

01:16:59.128 --> 01:17:02.165
Hold up. We've got one disaster here.
We don't need another one.

01:17:02.288 --> 01:17:05.166
Thank you. Finally,
someone who sticks up for me.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:09.122
I meant her hair.
Losing track of Toto, I blame you.

01:17:10.288 --> 01:17:13.166
- Guys, this isn't my fault.
- Nothing ever is.

01:17:13.288 --> 01:17:15.927
Looks like his head is drooping.
Somebody do something.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.527
We might have to cut into the street.

01:17:17.648 --> 01:17:21.277
We got the neighbourhood gas turned off
and we're cutting the power off right now.

01:17:21.408 --> 01:17:22.761
Yeah

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:26.763
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:17:26.968 --> 01:17:27.844
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:17:27.968 --> 01:17:29.959
If you're likin' what we're doin'
then c'mon

01:17:30.088 --> 01:17:32.238
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

01:17:32.368 --> 01:17:34.598
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing

01:17:34.728 --> 01:17:35.558
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:17:35.768 --> 01:17:36.518
- C'mon
- C'mon

01:17:36.648 --> 01:17:38.604
If you're likin' what we're sayin'
then c'mon

01:17:38.728 --> 01:17:40.639
We can turn the party out.
Make the people scream and shout

01:17:40.768 --> 01:17:43.919
And then my DJ's gonna do his thing...

01:17:45.848 --> 01:17:46.724
Yo, hello?

01:17:46.848 --> 01:17:50.921
Ladies and gentlemen, the generators
will be back on momentarily.

01:17:51.048 --> 01:17:56.998
You know what? This reminds me of
the great Manhattan blackout in 1977.

01:17:57.128 --> 01:18:02.156
I was going to the movies with my friends
the Captain and Tennille, and...

01:18:02.288 --> 01:18:06.281
Oh, the lights are back on.
Anyway, we were so excited...

01:18:06.408 --> 01:18:09.923
Listen, everybody.
He's a Bichon Frise, OK? He's my dog.

01:18:10.048 --> 01:18:12.278
It's not a salad dressing.
People get that mixed up.

01:18:12.408 --> 01:18:14.968
But listen, he's stuck in the hole
and I really want him out.

01:18:15.088 --> 01:18:18.603
- Please? That's all I'm asking for. Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:23.927
Following our story on the crazy gridlock
surrounding Manhattan Magnet school,

01:18:24.048 --> 01:18:26.437
Toto watch continues.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.798
We gotta help. Let's go.

01:18:31.688 --> 01:18:32.803
Come on.

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:36.086
Let's go.

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:42.599
Yo, they've gotta move fast.
They've gotta hurry.

01:18:45.528 --> 01:18:47.166
Galleria...

01:18:47.288 --> 01:18:49.597
Drinka, why is everyone here?
What happened to the talent show?

01:18:49.728 --> 01:18:53.403
The lights went out. It's OK.
Somebody shut down the power.

01:18:56.528 --> 01:19:01.238
I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Everything
is my fault. I mean, I ruined everything.

01:19:01.368 --> 01:19:03.245
I'm so sorry I got such a big head.

01:19:03.368 --> 01:19:07.281
It's OK. Yeah, you got a big head.

01:19:07.408 --> 01:19:10.081
But it's filled with big dreams.

01:19:10.208 --> 01:19:13.006
And you got a big heart to match it.

01:19:13.128 --> 01:19:16.564
But you know what? You need to
watch out about that big mouth.

01:19:19.368 --> 01:19:21.006
It's gonna be all right.

01:19:21.128 --> 01:19:23.847
Look, we created a little space for him,
but he's not moving.

01:19:23.968 --> 01:19:27.119
You're gonna have to get in here
and call to him.

01:19:27.248 --> 01:19:30.923
Baby... OK, you guys, come help me.
Please, come help me.

01:19:33.488 --> 01:19:35.558
Toto! Toto!

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:38.361
- Come on, Toto. Toto!
- He can't hear you.

01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:40.285
OK, now, come on.
Let him hear you.

01:19:40.408 --> 01:19:42.399
- "Together we can."
- OK.

01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:46.157
- Hold on. And sit tight
- Let him hear you.

01:19:46.288 --> 01:19:49.883
Are you ready for a crazy ride?

01:19:50.008 --> 01:19:52.568
- That's it. That's it.
- You're on your own

01:19:52.688 --> 01:19:55.361
It ain't right

01:19:55.488 --> 01:20:00.198
- Something's gotta give tonight
- That's it. He's moving. Come on, faster.

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:02.448
- Come on.
- Together we can

01:20:02.448 --> 01:20:04.200
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

01:20:04.328 --> 01:20:08.207
Even ride a hurricane
if we wanna

01:20:08.328 --> 01:20:12.401
- Together we can
- Walk into space. Save the human race

01:20:12.528 --> 01:20:14.962
- Do you think we oughta?
- Come on, you guys. Help us out.

01:20:15.088 --> 01:20:16.521
That's it. Faster.

01:20:16.648 --> 01:20:18.604
Shoot the moon. Stop the rain

01:20:18.728 --> 01:20:22.641
- Even ride a hurricane if we wanna
- He's wiggling. He's wiggling.

01:20:22.768 --> 01:20:25.840
Come on, faster, faster.
He's wiggling. He's wiggling.

01:20:25.968 --> 01:20:28.004
Come on. Come on.

01:20:47.728 --> 01:20:51.562
Baby. We're so glad you're OK.

01:20:52.768 --> 01:20:54.884
We're glad he's OK.

01:21:13.008 --> 01:21:16.637
They all came running when you sent up
the Cheetah distress signal.

01:21:16.768 --> 01:21:19.919
No. They came running for Toto.

01:21:22.408 --> 01:21:24.558
The Cheetah Girls, they're actually over.

01:21:26.928 --> 01:21:32.446
You know what? You were right.
I just... I just need to walk alone.

01:21:32.568 --> 01:21:36.083
You know, you were right to
walk away from Jackal's offer.

01:21:36.208 --> 01:21:38.961
I know I was. I know.

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:42.483
But now there's only one question.

01:21:42.608 --> 01:21:44.883
Are you right to walk away
from your friends?

01:21:46.008 --> 01:21:47.885
It's your call.

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:56.164
Cheetah!

01:22:34.648 --> 01:22:41.360
There's a time when we all choose

01:22:41.488 --> 01:22:47.677
- To either quit
- Or follow through

01:22:47.808 --> 01:22:51.118
To just lose faith

01:22:51.248 --> 01:22:54.524
Or trust your heart

01:22:54.648 --> 01:23:01.121
To somehow lead you
through the dark

01:23:01.248 --> 01:23:04.445
You're not the only one

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:07.765
Who's dreamin'

01:23:07.888 --> 01:23:13.485
Who needs help to carry on

01:23:13.608 --> 01:23:17.203
We might get lonely

01:23:17.328 --> 01:23:23.517
But we're not alone

01:23:38.488 --> 01:23:40.638
Cos we are sisters

01:23:40.768 --> 01:23:43.407
We stand together

01:23:43.528 --> 01:23:47.203
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

01:23:47.328 --> 01:23:49.603
Our spots are different

01:23:49.728 --> 01:23:52.003
Different colours

01:23:52.128 --> 01:23:56.201
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

01:23:59.088 --> 01:24:02.717
- We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters
- Gotta do what we gotta do

01:24:02.848 --> 01:24:04.964
Got the brains. Got the power
and we speak the truth

01:24:05.088 --> 01:24:06.680
We're from everywhere
All around the world

01:24:06.808 --> 01:24:09.766
So you best respect the Cheetah Girls

01:24:09.888 --> 01:24:13.767
Dancing. Singing from our birth.
Working hard for what we deserve

01:24:13.888 --> 01:24:17.722
Trying not to break the rules
cos Mama didn't raise no fools

01:24:17.848 --> 01:24:21.921
It may seem we're only dreaming

01:24:22.048 --> 01:24:25.882
And we need help to carry on

01:24:26.008 --> 01:24:30.206
It's good to know we're not alone

01:24:30.328 --> 01:24:32.319
Cos we are sisters

01:24:32.448 --> 01:24:35.042
We stand together

01:24:35.168 --> 01:24:38.877
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

01:24:39.008 --> 01:24:41.283
Our spots are different

01:24:41.408 --> 01:24:43.797
Different colours

01:24:43.928 --> 01:24:47.443
We make each other stronger
That ain't ever gonna change

01:24:47.568 --> 01:24:50.526
Believe it. Mister

01:24:50.648 --> 01:24:56.598
- We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters
- Someone's always there behind

01:24:56.728 --> 01:25:01.927
To catch us if we fall

01:25:05.008 --> 01:25:06.919
Come on and dance

01:25:13.568 --> 01:25:15.524
Come on and bounce

01:25:26.448 --> 01:25:27.767
All my girls. Bounce

01:25:31.848 --> 01:25:35.761
You really blew this one, Jackal.

01:25:35.888 --> 01:25:38.038
Cos we are sisters

01:25:38.168 --> 01:25:40.762
We stand together

01:25:40.888 --> 01:25:44.597
We make up one big family
though we don't look the same

01:25:44.728 --> 01:25:46.923
Our spots are different

01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:49.357
Different colours

01:25:49.488 --> 01:25:53.037
We make each other stronger
That ain't never gonna change

01:25:53.168 --> 01:25:56.080
Believe it. Mister

01:25:56.208 --> 01:26:00.724
We're Cheetah Girls. Cheetah sisters

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.768
So we're still friends, even though
the Cheetah Girls are over?

01:26:22.888 --> 01:26:24.162
The Cheetah Girls are over?

01:26:24.288 --> 01:26:26.643
Girl, I can't take no more news flashes.
Come on, now.

01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:29.077
But I saw the Global Getdown sign.
You guys took Jackal's deal.

01:26:29.208 --> 01:26:31.039
Girl, we didn't take that deal.

01:26:31.168 --> 01:26:34.160
We let some other puppet-heads
do that one. Believe that.

01:26:34.288 --> 01:26:37.041
But, Do, are you all right with money?
What about the Gold Medal Crew?

01:26:37.168 --> 01:26:40.524
I actually took the beginner class
while my instructor went on tour.

01:26:40.648 --> 01:26:43.321
I'm waiting for the real
Cheetah cheddar with my girls.

01:26:44.888 --> 01:26:46.958
Cheetah!

01:26:49.128 --> 01:26:50.447
- Dorinda!
- Dorinda!

01:26:50.568 --> 01:26:52.877
- Oh, hey.
- Honey, you were so good.

01:26:53.008 --> 01:26:55.317
Oh, thank you. How are you?

01:26:55.448 --> 01:26:58.520
Dorinda, can I be
a Cheetah Girl this time too?

01:27:00.208 --> 01:27:04.121
This is Mrs Bosco. She's my
foster mom. And this is my family.

01:27:04.248 --> 01:27:09.641
Oh, welcome. We need another
mama Cheetah in this jiggy jungle, huh?

01:27:09.768 --> 01:27:12.726
Announcement. Announcement.

01:27:12.848 --> 01:27:16.204
By an overwhelming
and unanimous decision,

01:27:16.328 --> 01:27:21.197
the Manhattan Magnet High School
Talent Show's first prize goes to...

01:27:21.328 --> 01:27:23.603
the Cheetah Girls.

01:27:34.088 --> 01:27:36.602
Hey, Cheetah World, Galleria speaking.

01:27:36.728 --> 01:27:39.117
- Jackal Johnson is calling?
- Oh, no.

01:27:39.248 --> 01:27:44.720
Hello? The Cheetah Girls do not run
with wolves or hang with hyenas.

01:27:44.848 --> 01:27:49.080
You tell him the Cheetah Girls follow their
own dreams and nobody else's, honey.

01:27:49.208 --> 01:27:52.439
You know what? Tell Jackal Johnson that
we depend on our family and our friends,

01:27:52.568 --> 01:27:57.483
and the growl power of the cheetahlicious
divas who came before us, to see us home.

01:27:57.608 --> 01:28:00.759
And you tell him we're gonna be stars
our day, our way.

01:28:00.888 --> 01:28:04.244
Tell Jackal Johnson that
the Cheetah Girls are unavailable.

01:28:12.088 --> 01:28:14.682
Cheetah!
