Synchro: Keller(Cody)

00:07.287 --> 00:10.149
Traduction: Mathilde.

00:10.543 --> 00:14.876
Fear not for the future,
weep not for the past.

00:16.322 --> 00:17.741
A royal welcome !

00:17.866 --> 00:20.085
Sent to investigate
allegations that Mandalore

00:20.094 --> 00:22.059
Was joining Count
Dooku's Separatists,

00:22.073 --> 00:24.706
Obi-Wan Kenobi was
reunited with an old friend,

00:24.831 --> 00:26.864
The Duchess Satine of Kalevala.

00:26.989 --> 00:29.406
While Satine claimed Mandalore's
intentions were

00:29.418 --> 00:32.332
To remain neutral during
the war, an attack on the capital

00:32.457 --> 00:35.145
City led Obi-Wan to the
discovery of a terrorist

00:35.270 --> 00:37.374
Organization known as
Death Watch.

00:37.499 --> 00:39.473
Now the Duchess travels to the Senate,

00:39.598 --> 00:42.319
So she can plead her case against her
involvement in the war,

00:42.444 --> 00:45.434
As the Jedi prepare
a defense against her opponents...

00:45.559 --> 00:48.378
You know your Marching orders.
The safety of the duchess satine

00:48.503 --> 00:50.055
Is of the utmost importance.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.436
The death watch will stop at
nothing to assassinate her

00:52.436 --> 00:54.615
Before she pleads her case to The senate.

00:54.849 --> 00:59.703
The death watch may be backed
by the separatists, so stay sharp. R2 ?

00:59.871 --> 01:03.582
Use your scanners to probe for
any suspicious droid cctivity.

01:03.707 --> 01:06.544
Anything else, sir?
No, that will be all.

01:10.048 --> 01:12.137
<i>- Yes ?
- The duchess and her retinue</i>

01:12.137 --> 01:14.337
<i>- Requests your presence.
- Very well.</i>

01:20.746 --> 01:23.209
I sense some anxiety
from you about the duchess.

01:23.564 --> 01:26.159
- She couldn't be in safer hands.
- Yes, I know.

01:26.284 --> 01:27.236
-Then why...

01:27.361 --> 01:29.777
Never mind.
It's all in the past.

01:30.154 --> 01:31.904
So you're close to her ?

01:32.029 --> 01:34.783
I knew her.
A long time ago.

01:48.299 --> 01:50.361
Let's move on to the next Sector.

02:01.693 --> 02:03.254
War is intolerable !

02:03.680 --> 02:07.836
We have been deceived into
thinking that we must be a part of it.

02:08.485 --> 02:12.115
I say the moment we committed
to fighting, we already lost.

02:12.529 --> 02:14.039
Excuse me, your grace,

02:14.164 --> 02:17.955
Are you suggesting we oppose
the war on humanitarian grounds ?

02:17.989 --> 02:20.820
I'm going to oppose it
as an affront to life itself.

02:21.435 --> 02:24.708
As the designated
regent Of 1,500 systems,

02:24.941 --> 02:27.965
I speak for thousands of
worlds that have urged me

02:28.090 --> 02:30.240
To allow them to
stay neutral in this war.

02:30.365 --> 02:35.632
And yet some might argue that the strongest
defense is a swift and decisive offense.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.650
You are quite the general now,
aren't you, Master Kenobi?

02:44.126 --> 02:47.836
Forgive me for interrupting,
your highness. I meant no disrespect.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.093
Really?

02:49.597 --> 02:51.242
Senators, i presume you are

02:51.367 --> 02:54.300
Acquainted with the collection
of half-truths and hyperbole

02:54.425 --> 02:55.963
Known as Obi-Wan Kenobi?

02:56.246 --> 02:58.541
Your highness is too kind.

02:58.666 --> 03:00.189
You're right. i am.

03:02.505 --> 03:05.594
Allow me to introduce
my fellow jedi Anakin skywalker.

03:06.476 --> 03:08.260
Your servant, my lady.

03:08.706 --> 03:13.099
I remember a time when jedi were
not generals but peacekeepers.

03:13.224 --> 03:17.812
We are protectors, highness... Yours, at
the moment. We fight for peace.

03:18.714 --> 03:20.629
What an amusing contradiction.

03:20.660 --> 03:24.069
What master skywalker means is
that we are acting at the behest of your,

03:24.194 --> 03:27.268
Highness to protect you from the Death
Watch and the separatists who,

03:27.393 --> 03:29.471
Don't share your neutral point of view.

03:29.596 --> 03:31.082
I asked for no such Thing.

03:31.207 --> 03:32.376
That may be so,

03:32.501 --> 03:34.626
But a majority of your court did.

03:37.016 --> 03:40.533
I do not remember you
as one to hide behind excuses.

03:41.088 --> 03:45.133
I do not remember you as one To shrink from responsibilities.

03:45.837 --> 03:48.148
I am certain we all agree.

03:48.472 --> 03:50.590
Duchess Satine and General Kenobi,

03:50.854 --> 03:54.393
Have a proven there are
two sides to every dilemma.

03:54.518 --> 03:59.649
- Indeed.
- Now, in regard to the senate vote, we think...

03:59.774 --> 04:02.903
I think a multitude makes
discord, not good counsel.

04:03.071 --> 04:05.155
Right again, my lady.

04:05.280 --> 04:07.410
There may be two sides to every dilemma,

04:07.643 --> 04:09.944
But the duchess only favors hers.

04:18.712 --> 04:22.385
- I'll check out the south Quadrant.
- Careful over there. It's dark.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.373
Yeah, very funny, Mixer.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.928
Stop messing around.
That's not funny.

04:48.783 --> 04:49.695
Droids.

04:53.379 --> 04:57.819
A republic military presence is the
only sure defense against the separatists.

04:57.944 --> 05:00.241
Even extremists can be reasoned with.

05:00.950 --> 05:05.262
Perhaps, if one can be heard over a
the clanking of their battle droids.

05:05.530 --> 05:09.148
- The sarcasm of a soldier.
- The delusion of a dreamer.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.847
Duchess, master jedi, It's been a long trip.

05:13.101 --> 05:16.193
I think we could all use a little rest and refreshment.

05:18.898 --> 05:22.841
Now let us put politics
aside until after dinner.

05:23.783 --> 05:24.634
<i>Fine !</i>

05:33.851 --> 05:36.629
Stand by for lightspeed. Engage.

05:39.378 --> 05:40.644
My side's secure.

05:40.769 --> 05:44.221
What have you got, redeye ?
Redeye, you copy ?

06:02.234 --> 06:03.886
You and satine have a history.

06:04.149 --> 06:06.338
An extended mission
when i was younger.

06:06.683 --> 06:09.339
Master Qui-Gon and I spent a
year on mandalore,

06:09.464 --> 06:12.816
protecting the duchess from insurgents
who had threatened her world.

06:17.482 --> 06:19.753
They sent bounty Hunters after us.

06:19.878 --> 06:23.261
We were always on the run,
living hand-to-mouth,

06:23.386 --> 06:26.809
- Never Sure what the next day would Bring.
- Sounds romantic.

06:44.914 --> 06:47.107
A civil war killed most of Satine's people,

06:47.401 --> 06:49.266
Hence her aversion to violence.

06:49.591 --> 06:53.392
When she returned, she took
rebuilding her world alone.

06:53.517 --> 06:56.972
- You didn't stay to help her ?
- That would have been problematic.

06:58.781 --> 07:01.244
My duty as a jedi demanded
i be elsewhere.

07:03.310 --> 07:04.223
Demanded?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.646
But it's obvious you had Feelings for her.

07:06.771 --> 07:09.585
- Surely that would affect your Decision.
- It did.

07:10.112 --> 07:13.029
- I live by the jedi code.
- Of course.

07:13.403 --> 07:17.073
As master yoda says:
"A jedi must not form attachments."

07:17.241 --> 07:21.642
Yes. But he usually leaves
out the undercurrent of remorse.

07:21.767 --> 07:24.622
Yes, captain?
General, something's wrong

07:24.747 --> 07:27.501
With skywalker's astromech.
Scared him a real good, sir.

07:27.669 --> 07:29.777
<i>I've also lost contact with
two of my men.</i>

07:29.902 --> 07:33.212
- I'm on my way down to assist you.
- I'll go, master.

07:33.466 --> 07:37.268
If there's something dangerous Down there, the clones and i Can handle it.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.416
Deep-fried nuna legs.

07:43.912 --> 07:44.936
Delicious.

07:47.652 --> 07:49.821
I beg your pardon, senators.

07:49.946 --> 07:52.517
Our men are investigating
a situation below decks.

07:53.196 --> 07:56.532
I respectfully ask you to
wait here until it is settled.

07:58.388 --> 08:01.308
All right, men. What's the problem?
I'm missing dinner.

08:01.531 --> 08:05.458
We're not sure yet, sir, but there's
still no sign of Mixer and redeye.

08:05.583 --> 08:07.066
What's the matter, buddy?

08:08.120 --> 08:09.914
I know. i know.
But i'm here now.

08:10.442 --> 08:13.092
Use your scanners.
See if something's out of place.

08:27.189 --> 08:29.165
Well, what've we here ?

08:29.945 --> 08:32.389
Looks like the contents of
this box are missing.

08:32.936 --> 08:34.948
Or it got up and Walked away.

08:35.073 --> 08:36.423
All right, fan out.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.912
Separate squads.
I'll contact obi-wan.

08:42.986 --> 08:44.255
Please excuse me.

08:46.505 --> 08:48.402
Anakin, what have you found?

08:48.527 --> 08:51.534
<i>There's a large open container,
and the contents are missing.</i>

08:51.659 --> 08:53.804
<i>And i still have two
men unaccounted for.</i>

08:53.929 --> 08:55.133
That's not good.

08:55.935 --> 08:58.350
Keep things quiet.
I'll stay with the senators.

08:58.475 --> 08:59.262
Got it.

09:00.772 --> 09:02.657
What's up?
Did you find something?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.982
There you are. Redeye,
where have you been?

09:15.107 --> 09:16.767
You've had us all worried.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.230
Redeye?

09:47.904 --> 09:48.771
The lift!

09:56.700 --> 09:58.999
Obi-wan. There's assassin
probes down here.

09:59.124 --> 10:01.606
<i>One made it up the lift.
I'll try to hold the others Here.</i>

10:01.608 --> 10:03.263
Quickly!
Secure the lifts!

10:09.803 --> 10:11.256
Ah! help!

10:20.673 --> 10:23.244
There might be one left.
Let's spread out and find it.

10:23.282 --> 10:24.275
Watch it !

10:35.069 --> 10:36.457
They're everywhere!

10:36.625 --> 10:37.916
Get behind me!

10:39.309 --> 10:40.302
Get it off !

10:54.894 --> 10:57.313
Do you always carry
a deactivator?

10:59.233 --> 11:02.203
Just because i'm a pacifist doesn't
i mean i won't defend myself.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.944
Now you sound like a jedi.

11:12.313 --> 11:13.306
Good work, men.

11:13.431 --> 11:14.472
You too, buddy.

11:16.974 --> 11:18.201
Assassin droid.

11:18.629 --> 11:20.588
How did that monster
end up in the hold?

11:20.713 --> 11:23.758
Question is: Who smuggled him onboard?

11:26.903 --> 11:30.009
Just like that Swarm of venom-mites On draboon, remember?

11:30.285 --> 11:33.098
How could i forget?
I still have the scar.

11:34.013 --> 11:38.357
Begging your pardon, duchess. I distinctly
remember carrying you to safety.

11:38.482 --> 11:41.976
I meant the scar i got after
you fell and dropped me.

11:42.101 --> 11:43.655
Oh. yes.

11:44.127 --> 11:46.741
I'm looking for the droid
that services the cargo bay.

11:46.998 --> 11:51.445
Yes sir, are all those
creatures dead?

11:51.893 --> 11:53.781
That's what i'm
trying to find out.

11:53.906 --> 11:55.942
You're in charge of the
cargo Manifest, right?

11:56.067 --> 11:56.759
Yes.

11:57.513 --> 11:59.070
I have it right here.

11:59.396 --> 12:01.303
Well, where did they Come from?

12:02.112 --> 12:04.769
It is right here, on the manifest.

12:05.704 --> 12:08.477
"For immediate delivery to
Coruscant: one container marked

12:08.516 --> 12:10.852
'Medical supplies.'
There's no name on this chart!

12:11.105 --> 12:13.101
There is no indication
of who shipped it.

12:13.355 --> 12:15.662
No, sir, Just the senate stamp,

12:15.915 --> 12:19.819
Always accepted for transport
here aboard the coronet.

12:26.869 --> 12:29.545
One of our four
distinguished senators,

12:29.670 --> 12:32.124
- Appears to be a traitor.
- I sense it too.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.339
It looks like one of our
little visitors is still alive.

12:38.464 --> 12:40.962
I have an idea how to
expose the turncoat.

12:41.087 --> 12:44.583
Return to the hull of the ship.
Destroy the last assassin droids.

12:44.708 --> 12:47.367
i'll find out which of the
senators is the traitor.

12:51.197 --> 12:53.981
Duchess, you are not eating.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.941
I have no appetite.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.321
begging your pardon, you must keep up your strength.

12:59.916 --> 13:02.240
by all means, be my guest, senator.

13:03.323 --> 13:07.060
If you insist.
Ah ! dessert !

13:07.313 --> 13:08.623
Excellent!

13:08.748 --> 13:10.983
This morsel might
prove too much even,

13:11.108 --> 13:13.494
For the legendary
appetite of Orn Free Taa.

13:15.297 --> 13:16.380
Enjoy.

13:18.225 --> 13:21.345
On second thought,
it wouldn't agree with me.

13:21.513 --> 13:24.958
My theory is our little
friend will attack the,

13:25.083 --> 13:27.809
Duchess and anyone
who defends her.

13:28.238 --> 13:31.966
Anyone, that is, except the
traitor who programmed it.

13:33.530 --> 13:34.581
take it away!

13:34.706 --> 13:37.189
- Please !
- Obi-Wan, this line of questioning,

13:37.314 --> 13:38.488
Borders on torture!

13:44.858 --> 13:48.499
Oh, I assure our pacifist
duchess that all is under control.

13:49.121 --> 13:51.604
I'm a trying to expose a bigger threat.

13:52.505 --> 13:53.693
Interesting.

13:53.917 --> 13:58.121
The droid displays unusual hostility
toward the honorable kin robb...

14:03.430 --> 14:06.817
But it seems to like you,
senator Merrik.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.948
Well, prince ?

14:11.567 --> 14:14.810
Really, general kenobi,
you're quite clever.

14:29.844 --> 14:31.754
You're coming with me.

14:40.871 --> 14:44.977
Anakin, Tal Merrik is the traitor,
and he's taken Satine hostage.

14:45.102 --> 14:48.590
Copy that, but i've got
problems of my own right now.

14:54.113 --> 14:56.843
Cody, rex, have you Found anything?

14:57.197 --> 14:58.955
All quiet over here, sir.

15:02.341 --> 15:03.664
Wait a minute...

15:19.789 --> 15:21.122
Thanks, little guy.

15:21.247 --> 15:23.895
Well, we found the little ones.
What about the mother?

15:24.063 --> 15:25.259
Haven't seen it.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.235
No, please, i beg you.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.603
Monster ! You're a
horrid monster !

15:57.728 --> 15:59.100
Get used to it.

16:02.952 --> 16:05.454
- Did you find them ?
- No, but i've stationed troopers,

16:05.579 --> 16:08.246
- At every escape pod.
- Merrik will try to signal

16:08.371 --> 16:10.529
his allies for help.
We have to find him.

16:14.397 --> 16:18.204
This may not be the time to ask,
but were you and Satine, ever...

16:18.329 --> 16:21.541
I don't see how that has any
bearing on the situation at hand.

16:30.178 --> 16:32.796
- Death watch command.
- Tal merrik here.

16:33.302 --> 16:36.529
Senator merrik. Have you
completed your mission?

16:36.909 --> 16:41.062
Yes, sir. I have the duchess,
but i'll need help getting her away.

16:41.230 --> 16:44.983
Very good. Reinforcements
are on their way.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.638
I'll take care of this, Obi-wan. You ?
Go find your girlfriend.

17:04.863 --> 17:07.454
Right. No, Anakin, she's not my...

17:19.770 --> 17:21.998
Come in, kenobi.
You're expected.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.319
Tal Merrik, you are under arrest.
Release the duchess.

17:26.573 --> 17:30.430
I took the precaution of wiring
the ship's engines to explode.

17:30.664 --> 17:33.703
I press this remote, and we all die.

17:33.828 --> 17:36.271
Obi, if you have any
respect for me, you will

17:36.290 --> 17:39.167
Not take such risks with so
many people's lives at stake.

17:39.335 --> 17:40.291
Satine...

17:40.711 --> 17:41.576
Don't.

18:20.845 --> 18:23.746
This is merrik.
Stand by to disengage.

18:23.871 --> 18:26.385
Say farewell, duchess.

18:26.553 --> 18:29.917
Obi-wan, it looks like
I may never see you again.

18:30.184 --> 18:33.824
I don't know quite how to say
this, but i've loved you

18:34.038 --> 18:37.313
From the moment you came to
my aid all those years ago.

18:37.438 --> 18:39.275
I don't believe this.

18:39.525 --> 18:42.945
Satine, this is hardly
the time or place for...

18:45.364 --> 18:46.415
All right.

18:47.037 --> 18:50.745
Had you said the word, I would
have left the Jedi order.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.780
That is touching.

18:53.101 --> 18:58.003
Truly, it is. But it's making me
sick, and we really must be going.

18:58.128 --> 19:01.854
You have the romantic Soul of a slug, Merrik.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.429
And slugs are so often Trod upon.

19:07.761 --> 19:09.601
Interesting turnabout,
but even if i do not,

19:09.726 --> 19:14.166
Deliver the duchess alive
to the separatists, i still win.

19:14.867 --> 19:18.984
The second i'm away, I'll hit the
remote and blow the coronet to bits.

19:19.109 --> 19:20.903
I will not allow that.

19:21.028 --> 19:22.238
What will you do?

19:22.363 --> 19:24.282
If you shoot me, you prove yourself,

19:24.407 --> 19:28.446
A hypocrite to every pacifist
ideal you hold dear.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.782
And you, kenobi.

19:31.165 --> 19:32.875
You are no stranger to violence.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.116
You'd be hailed as a hero
by everyone on this ship...

19:36.630 --> 19:38.756
Almost everyone.

19:41.384 --> 19:46.020
Come on, then. Who will strike first and
brand themselves a cold-blooded killer ?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.478
- Anakin...
- What ?

19:58.722 --> 20:00.655
He was going to
blow up the ship.

20:04.627 --> 20:05.942
Obi-wan, I...

20:06.067 --> 20:09.289
General skywalker, the last of
the droids have been defeated, sir.

20:09.717 --> 20:10.826
Very good, cody.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.278
I must get back to the
business of diplomacy.

20:18.288 --> 20:21.685
As you say, duchess.
Some other time.

20:56.198 --> 21:00.440
- A job well done, Master jedi.
- Thank you, chancellor.

21:00.654 --> 21:01.950
Your excellency.

21:11.768 --> 21:15.862
How ironic to meet again, only
to find we're on opposing sides.

21:15.987 --> 21:18.434
The needs of your people Are all that matter.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.035
They couldn't be in a better Hands with you to guide their Future.

21:22.366 --> 21:26.121
Kind words indeed from A mindful and committed jedi.

21:26.529 --> 21:27.583
And yet...

21:27.708 --> 21:28.542
What?

21:28.826 --> 21:31.837
I'm still not sure About the beard.

21:31.962 --> 21:33.922
Why?
What's wrong with it?

21:34.091 --> 21:36.616
It hides too much of Your handsome face.

21:41.317 --> 21:43.108
What was that all about?

21:44.743 --> 21:48.107
- A very remarkable woman.
- She is indeed.
