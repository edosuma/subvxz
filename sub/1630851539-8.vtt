WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:06.307
His name's Creary,
and we have to help him.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.541
He saved our lives.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
I tracked
that number you found,

00:09.077 --> 00:11.345
last one Harvey called,
registered to a Chuck Ryan.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.380
He's a lawyer.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.082
Hey!
What did you do to Smiley?

00:17.251 --> 00:19.187
Wait for my call.
Put him in the hole.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.388
Travis, where are you?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.390
I love you.

00:24.058 --> 00:27.195
Move.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.262
Where's my daughter?

00:28.296 --> 00:29.663
She's losing patience.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.165
Perhaps we should
tell her the truth.

00:31.199 --> 00:34.102
Phoebe is with my sister
in Helena.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.936
It's called
Nuevo Nirvana.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.205
Ren Bhullar?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.039
It's Ren's brother.
Heya, Jag.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.174
Dhruv.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.879
It's now or never.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.549
Go get my little girl
and bring her back to me.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.494
No. No.
I -- Okay, I...

02:40.528 --> 02:42.663
I found
some drugs at a crash.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.732
He was just gonna
help me sell them, man.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.367
Okay. Okay.
Where's the rest of the drugs?

02:47.768 --> 02:49.337
Come on!

02:49.370 --> 02:51.239
The drugs are at a shed
at my house.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.406
Okay, and the rest of
the money?

02:52.440 --> 02:53.674
There's no money.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.009
No, the money
from the crash, okay?

02:56.043 --> 02:57.811
There were two bags.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.180
One had money
and the other, drugs.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.749
Where is it?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.725
Sit down.
Sit down.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.694
Okay, okay.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.699
Hey, Dietrich.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
Smiley's dead.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.869
They sent his hand
in a box.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.672
Wait, what?
Are you serious?

03:24.705 --> 03:27.174
Ren's sick idea
of a message.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
Okay, uh...

03:31.379 --> 03:33.914
What do you want me
to do with this guy?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.215
<i>Kill him.</i>

03:35.249 --> 03:37.418
Wait --

03:39.052 --> 03:41.255
I don't trust him.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.424
Smiley wanted to talk to me
for a reason.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.260
You ready to get to work?

03:55.669 --> 03:57.237
No! No, no! No!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.581
Thank you.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.652
So what am I looking at?

04:11.685 --> 04:13.153
It's a severed hand, sir.

04:13.186 --> 04:15.456
I can see that. Whose?
Smiley.

04:15.489 --> 04:18.225
It's a message from
the Bhullar cartel to Dietrich.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.827
They're fighting over
the missing drugs and money.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.128
The same drugs and money

04:21.161 --> 04:23.397
our dear departed
Deputy Harvey took?

04:23.431 --> 04:25.265
Maybe he did. Maybe he didn't.
We don't know that.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.567
I'd like to know
for sure,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.502
but as you've made it
very clear,

04:28.536 --> 04:31.639
Harvey's murder is being handled
by State and not by me.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.273
In effect, tying our hand,

04:33.307 --> 04:35.142
hence this photo of
the severed hand, to --

04:35.175 --> 04:36.610
Poppernak.
Yes.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.278
Just give me
a minute, okay?

04:38.312 --> 04:39.713
You got it.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.951
Thank you, Deputy.
Yes, sir.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.156
State called and filled me in
on this Bhullar family.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.658
They're a nasty bunch.

04:50.691 --> 04:52.660
Oh, I know that. I've already
met with the daughter.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.495
Well, that's good to know.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.196
So now you can tell me
about this undercover agent

04:56.229 --> 04:57.698
State says you're
having a fling with.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.066
Is that true?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.704
I have access to information

05:03.737 --> 05:06.306
no one else
in this department has,

05:06.340 --> 05:08.842
and my personal life
is none of your business.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.478
They think
he's dirty, Jenny.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.012
I think they're wrong.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.547
Okay.

05:13.581 --> 05:15.883
Do you know
what my job is?

05:15.916 --> 05:17.351
Our job?

05:17.385 --> 05:20.354
It's to keep
the people safe.

05:20.388 --> 05:24.324
If I let a drug war break out,
I've failed at that job.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.293
We need to make arrests,
get people off the streets.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.162
The only way to make arrests
is to get more information,

05:29.196 --> 05:31.164
and the only one
who can do that is me.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.933
Put me back on the case,
Tubb.

05:34.402 --> 05:36.504
Alright, you're back on.
Find something.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.138
There's not going to be
a drug war on my watch.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.540
Yes, sir.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.808
Jenny?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.042
Yeah?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.077
Don't make me
regret this.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.516
Trust.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.094
Jag.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.863
Could have told me
you were coming.

06:02.896 --> 06:07.234
And ruin the surprise?
You know that's not my style.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.378
Dhruv.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.882
Oh, I'm happy to see you!

06:21.915 --> 06:24.552
How have you been?
I'm studying for the LSAT.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.554
Good for you.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.922
He hit me in the face.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.390
Okay,
some ground rules.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.925
You have him touch
one of my people again,

06:31.959 --> 06:33.226
I'm gonna kick you in the balls
and shoot you.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.261
Donno was out of line.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.729
I was practicing
hospitality.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.465
He's telling the truth.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.733
Seems like you've got quite
the blended family here, Ren.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.969
Why don't you tell me
why you're here, Jag.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.537
Well, first,
a good night's sleep,

06:43.571 --> 06:45.539
then a healthy breakfast,
and then we can discuss

06:45.573 --> 06:46.940
how things
are being handled.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.241
Nothing to discuss.
We have it handled.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.410
Yeah, okay.
No, you don't.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.580
But, uh, it's cool.
And we're here.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.214
Just so you know,
that's a good thing,

06:54.247 --> 06:55.616
'cause I stopped Dad
from coming here.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.050
Why would he come here?

06:57.084 --> 06:58.719
The girlfriend.
Oh, God.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.420
I know.
Uh, wants to ride horses.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.255
And he wanted to check in
on his assets,

07:02.289 --> 07:04.157
so you know what I told him?

07:04.191 --> 07:07.561
I said I was sure that you were
taking care of everything,

07:07.595 --> 07:08.996
and just to make sure,

07:09.029 --> 07:10.330
I was gonna pop down here
and see what's what.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.765
How little brother
of you.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.333
Right?

07:13.366 --> 07:15.002
We're a family. I got you.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.470
So I'm gonna give you
to the end of the week,

07:16.504 --> 07:18.171
then Dhruv here is gonna
start dropping bodies

07:18.205 --> 07:19.740
and I'm taking you
back to Canada,

07:19.773 --> 07:20.774
'cause Dad said so.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.177
Okay.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.813
Let's talk about
breakfast tomorrow.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.581
I'm thinking
something healthy.

07:27.615 --> 07:33.453
Um, protein, sourdough, really
nice olive oil, and, um...

07:33.487 --> 07:36.056
Avocado.
Good fats. Brain fuel.

Really?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.946
She used to dance whenever
she was happy about something.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.948
You never told me that.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.283
So...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.018
Something or someone
in particular

08:05.052 --> 08:06.820

08:14.094 --> 08:15.563
We all do.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.331
Speaking of which, I put in
my offer on the ranch.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.734
Oh, Dad.
That's amazing.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.004
You know there's
another buyer

08:24.037 --> 08:25.372
interested in that ranch, too.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.207

08:39.252 --> 08:40.721
Did you find Travis?

08:40.754 --> 08:41.722
Not exactly.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.358
But he's okay?

08:45.392 --> 08:47.861
No way of knowing for sure.
That's not why I'm here.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.897
I ran into Tonya today.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.032
What? So did I.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.501
She was looking at a ranch
my dad wants to buy

08:54.534 --> 08:55.836
for her new boss.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.370
You ask her who that was?

08:57.404 --> 08:59.907
I did.
She wouldn't say.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.875
Well, she wouldn't,
'cause she's working for

09:01.909 --> 09:04.845
Ren Bhullar,
as in Bhullar cartel.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.248
Wow. Okay.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.718
Her family's making a push
into Helena,

09:10.751 --> 09:12.953
which means things are gonna
get a lot worse.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.122
I don't understand why Tonya
would be working for her.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.190
You should talk to her,
see if you can get
anything out of her.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.425
Okay.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.124
Thinking of doing
an ice cream run.

09:51.158 --> 09:52.760
Now, you can't come
for the ride,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.427
but I can get you
something.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.495
What's your favorite?

09:57.030 --> 09:59.499
Hey.
What's the matter?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.835
There's a monster
in my room.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.138
There is no monster,
Phoebe.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.740
Yes, there is.

10:10.343 --> 10:12.012
Hmm.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.514
You seem like a strawberry swirl
kind of girl.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.806
Shh.

Cassie.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.868
What a coincidence.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.202
It's not a coincidence.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.538
I didn't think so.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.274
I'm just checking in,
seeing how you're doing.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377
I'm all good.
Really?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.213
When you hired me to
find your boyfriend,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.382
I thought you had nothing to do
with what he was mixed up in,

11:22.415 --> 11:23.717
and now I'm not so sure.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.018
What are you
talking about?

11:25.052 --> 11:27.020
I hear you're working
for Ren Bhullar.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.388
Wow.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.057
She's in real estate,

11:30.090 --> 11:32.392
and that's something that's
been of interest to me.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.994
She's a drug dealer,
Tonya.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.729
And not just
any drug dealer.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.098
She's part of
the Bhullar cartel.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.867
Where are you
getting this?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.102
Ren is a successful
businesswoman,

11:42.135 --> 11:44.537
and she has been
very good to me.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.874
Before or after
she kidnapped you?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.109
Deputy Harvey
kidnapped me.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.382
Tonya, whatever it is
that you're involved in,

11:55.415 --> 11:57.885
I can help you.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.787
Is this about the ranch?

11:59.820 --> 12:02.122
I'm sorry if they decide
to accept our offer

12:02.155 --> 12:04.925
over your dad's,
but what's fair is fair.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.727
No, it's not about
the ranch.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.729
But what do you think would
happen if I told the owner

12:09.763 --> 12:11.799
how your boss
makes her money?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.733
I guess we'll see.
Mm.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.103
Anything else?
I'd love to order my breakfast.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.938
I'm really hungry.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.440
Wow.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.970
Hey, guys.
You up?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.738
We are now.
What do you want?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.574
Uh, Creary's awake.
Come on.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.118
Hey, what is it?

13:05.152 --> 13:06.353
What if they can prove
the key chain

13:06.386 --> 13:07.988
they found at Harvey's house
is mine?

13:09.289 --> 13:12.459
Then we will
face them together.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
Okay?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.868
Hey.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.035
How you feeling?

13:22.069 --> 13:25.205
Grateful.
You saved my life.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.539
You saved ours.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.208
You better take these
with you.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.615
I can't believe we actually
pulled that off.

13:37.184 --> 13:38.518
They'll never stop
looking for you

13:38.551 --> 13:40.120
if you don't give them
what they want.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.122
Those bags
don't belong to you.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.857
We're giving them back,
okay?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.727
Promise me.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.232
We know we can't keep them.
Right, guys?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.168
It's too dangerous.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.738
Too many people
have gotten hurt.

14:02.109 --> 14:05.212
One of these muffins
has your name on it.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.379
What'd I tell you
about this?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.547
No donuts, I thought.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.883
All baked goods.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.885
They do smell good.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.354
It can be
our little secret.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.389
Any update on
the fingerprint job I gave you?

14:16.423 --> 14:19.092
Got prints off
the coffee cup.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.261
State has the key chain
from Harvey's crime scene.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.562
Waiting on them
to compare.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.064
Give them a nudge,
will you?

14:24.097 --> 14:25.532
I'm on it.
But we just got a call

14:25.565 --> 14:26.833
that might be
of interest.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.335
Woman says
her boyfriend's missing,

14:28.368 --> 14:29.869
and the last time
she saw him,

14:29.903 --> 14:32.005
he told her he was gonna turn in
a bag of drugs he found.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.873
Tracy Ridgeton,
goes by T-Lock.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.208
I didn't ask,
but T-Lock's a great name

14:35.242 --> 14:36.676
for a professional
wrestler.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.877
When I was a kid,
they called me Ninja --

14:37.911 --> 14:40.914
Okay, let's just
go talk to her.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.324
It's been a day since
I last heard from him,
and he goes by T-Lock.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.958
Yes, we're aware
of his handle.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.827
When you called the station,
you said something about

16:00.860 --> 16:05.332
Tracy -- T-Lock --
turning in a bag of drugs?

16:05.365 --> 16:08.135
Yes, he found them
in the woods.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.204
Or the side of the road.
I -- I'm not sure.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.639
The more details
you can remember,

16:12.672 --> 16:15.008
the better chance we have
of finding him.

16:15.042 --> 16:18.011
He told he me was going
to turn them in to the police.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.546
Turn them in how?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.048
He was going to make
an anonymous phone call

16:21.081 --> 16:22.382
or drop them off.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.384
Did you ever see
the drugs?

16:26.419 --> 16:29.356
Rachel. Rachel, it's okay.
You can tell us.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.858
I-I think he said he put them
in the shed.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.926
Can you show us?

16:39.566 --> 16:41.968
Wait. The door.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.370
It was closed earlier.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.972
Go back inside.

17:43.963 --> 17:47.567
I am glad that you decided
to do this.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.770
It's like
nothing's changed.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.272
Uh, t-that's not true.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.741
I, uh -- I had new windows
installed in the bedrooms.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.576
It, uh --
Better insulation.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.945
It kinda, uh,
keeps -- keeps the noise out.

17:58.978 --> 18:01.080
Except now your mom
is complaining

18:01.114 --> 18:04.484
that she can't hear the birds.

18:04.517 --> 18:09.322
It just seems like I can't
do anything right these days.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.960
Come in.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.674
Uh...

18:27.707 --> 18:29.809
I'm doing
all the housework now.

18:29.842 --> 18:33.746
It's not quite up
to your mom's standards.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.993
Can I get you
something to drink?

18:47.026 --> 18:50.463
Coffee? Whiskey?

18:50.497 --> 18:51.864
I'm good.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.970
I'm gonna have
a whiskey.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.540
Why?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.941
Uh...

19:01.974 --> 19:06.279
I'm nervous
having you back like this.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.015
You do you.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.550
Don't mind if I do.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.056
Where is she?

19:17.089 --> 19:18.791
She's...

19:18.825 --> 19:20.360
Hospice has already
checked in,

19:20.393 --> 19:22.529
so she should be
pretty good.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.063
You tell her
I was coming?

19:24.096 --> 19:25.398
I did.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.401
You sure
you don't want one?

19:46.619 --> 19:49.021
Are you ready for this?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.390
No, but --

19:50.423 --> 19:52.592
It's a stupid question.
Of course you're not.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.193
How could you be?

19:54.227 --> 19:56.696
Uh, if you want, I'll -- I'll --
I'll go in first.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.964
We don't want
to shock her, and --

19:59.432 --> 20:01.401
I -- I don't mean --

20:01.434 --> 20:02.869
It's not that --
It's just --
It's fine.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.136
Wait.
Really.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.396
Hey, Mom.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.769
Man, it's freezing in here,
Denise.
Ugh.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.271
Got another one of those
blankets for me?

20:38.305 --> 20:39.772
No.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.909
But there's plenty of room
inside, if you --

20:42.942 --> 20:45.077
Oh. I might
take you up on that.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.747
Oh, promises, promises.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.149
I'll grab those parts
and see you back here later?

20:50.182 --> 20:51.718
Sounds good.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.653
Joseph!
Are you gonna fix the boiler?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.322
Nothing I can't fix.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.824
In that case, I happen to have
a fresh pot of coffee,

20:57.857 --> 20:58.925
if you want some.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.561
And it's hot.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.631
Uh, don't mind if I do.
Now, who's this?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.466
Oh. Dad,
this is Mark Lindor.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.403
Right!
The famous U.S. Marshal.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.405
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Likewise.

21:12.439 --> 21:16.075
Okay, uh, can I speak with you
in my office?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.644
Excuse me.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.785
Hello.
Hey.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.756
You know, I didn't expect to
meet your dad quite so soon.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.425
So, um...

21:32.459 --> 21:34.961
I just -- I just
talked to Tonya.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.829
And?
I don't trust her.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.631
She's working
for Ren Bhullar now.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.299
Okay. Twist.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.802
But has she been working for her
this whole time?

21:42.835 --> 21:44.337
I don't know.

21:44.371 --> 21:47.173
But what I do know is,
they want to buy the ranch

21:47.206 --> 21:48.541
that my dad has
his heart set on.

21:48.575 --> 21:51.444
"They" as in
Ren Bhullar?

21:51.478 --> 21:53.380
With Tonya helping them,
yeah.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.948
Cartel's putting roots down
in Helena.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.684
Not good.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.286
Your turn.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.255
Oh, well, I can't stop thinking
about yesterday.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.194
So, what? You wanna -- You wanna
talk about it right now?

22:08.227 --> 22:09.462
My dad's right there.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.797
Mm. True.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.032
Okay, but, um,
just for the record,

22:13.065 --> 22:15.835
I left the house this morning
still wearing pajamas.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.037
Because of the kiss?
Mm. It's complicated.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.872
Yeah.
I was thinking
maybe dinner tonight.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.140
I cook.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.642
I make
a decent Bolognese.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.877
I have to help my dad
fix the boiler.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.847
You know, there are these guys
called repairmen,

22:27.880 --> 22:29.649
that you call them,
they come --

22:29.682 --> 22:31.551
Mm-hmm. Repair.
Yeah. Exactly.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.219
Uh, my dad's
one of those

22:33.252 --> 22:34.821
"Don't pay someone
to fix something

22:34.854 --> 22:37.323
you can fix for yourself"
types.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.825
Mm.
Principle, you know.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.159
Old school.
Yeah.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.495
Okay.
I can respect that.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.531
This weekend?

22:44.564 --> 22:45.898
Weekend's great.

23:01.313 --> 23:06.886
I'm gonna get a milkshake,
burger, and fries.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.255
What do you want?
I want to see my mother.

23:09.288 --> 23:12.058
Well, we're going to see her,
but first we have to eat.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.760
I'm not hungry.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.962
I want you to tell me
what's going on.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.599
What's going on is,
we're going to eat first,

23:19.632 --> 23:21.400
and then we're going
to see your mother.

23:21.434 --> 23:23.636
I know that there are
people looking for you.

23:25.772 --> 23:27.774
Who said that?

23:27.807 --> 23:29.576
People.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.881
What else have you
heard about me?

23:34.914 --> 23:36.883
I heard that
you're a bad man.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.919
That is not true,
Phoebe.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.554
I've had issues,
but I've worked on them,

23:41.588 --> 23:42.955
and I have changed.

23:42.989 --> 23:45.592
You believe people can change,
don't you?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.094
I don't know.

23:48.127 --> 23:49.729
What hasn't changed

23:49.762 --> 23:51.297
is how much I love you

23:51.330 --> 23:53.065
and how much
I love your mom,

23:53.099 --> 23:55.902
and I will do anything
to keep you both safe.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.939

Are you sure T-Lock
didn't say anything else

24:17.957 --> 24:19.158
about how the drugs
were found --

24:19.191 --> 24:20.960
anything at all?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.261
I don't think so, no.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.630
Can you please
just look for him?

24:23.663 --> 24:25.231
I'm worried.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.668
Rachel,
you have to consider

24:28.701 --> 24:30.537
that T-Lock may not want
to be found.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.004
What do you mean?

24:32.038 --> 24:35.007
Well, a guy with his background,
without a job,

24:35.041 --> 24:36.709
finding a big bag
of drugs.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.045
He might see this
as an opportunity.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.148
You think he left?

24:42.181 --> 24:43.516
Um,
I'm sorry.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.984
We're gonna need
a recent photo of T-Lock

24:45.017 --> 24:46.252
to start a canvass.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.630
Wait. Go back.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.465
Who's that?

24:59.498 --> 25:00.900
That's just
my daughter, Max.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.602
Max?

25:04.236 --> 25:06.573
Um, she has nothing
to do with this.

25:07.940 --> 25:12.344
Max, she babysits for
Cassie Dewell, doesn't she?

25:12.378 --> 25:14.547
Mm-hmm.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.095
What do you think?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.698
It's a ranch in Montana.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.399
Yeah.
Already put in a bid.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.534
It's almost like you want to be
as far away as possible

25:35.568 --> 25:37.570
from me and Dad.
Imagine that.

25:37.604 --> 25:40.006
Look, we're at war
with the local distributor.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.207
Now you want to
put down roots?

25:41.240 --> 25:43.375
The locals just need
new leadership.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.678
I already have
a candidate.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.381
Dramatic.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.053
Remember me?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.521
How did you find me?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.723
I'm resourceful.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.725
Hm.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.727
I believe
this belongs to you.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.097
Jag, meet Stone.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.299
Jag is here to --
Oversee.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.601
That's not how
I'd put it.

26:09.936 --> 26:12.204
This just shows up
the day I get into town?

26:12.238 --> 26:13.439
Told you
I had it handled.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.974
Yeah.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.209
So how did you even f--
Did Dietrich have it?

26:19.846 --> 26:23.049
No. No, a civilian got to it
before your boy Harvey did.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.717
What about the money?

26:24.751 --> 26:25.952
He didn't know
anything about it.

26:25.985 --> 26:27.586
How can you be so sure?

26:27.620 --> 26:29.321
Well, because I beat
the truth out of him

26:29.355 --> 26:30.757
for about an hour
before I killed him.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.326
Where is the money?

26:34.360 --> 26:35.895
I have a hunch.
Great.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.930
I'll call Dad and tell him
you've got a hunch.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.466
Or we can handle this together,
like a family.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.434
What about the locals?

26:42.468 --> 26:43.670
I'll handle Dietrich.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.404
Thank you.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.406
See? Leadership.

27:00.119 --> 27:03.522
Stone's a traitor.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.524
At least now I know
what Smiley wanted to tell me.

27:05.557 --> 27:06.826
You want me to shoot him
in the head

27:06.859 --> 27:09.361
or drop him
so you can finish him?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.297
Neither.
What about Ren?

27:11.330 --> 27:12.832
I'll give you a price for
all of them.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.366
Disposal's
gonna be extra.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.370
Nah, if we kill Ren,
her daddy will come down here,

27:18.404 --> 27:19.706
and he'll kill
every last one of us.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.373
Doesn't matter
who pulls the trigger.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.877
He'll wipe
the slate clean.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.512
So we're not
doing this?

27:26.545 --> 27:27.714
Not now.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.689
Hey. I came as soon
as I got your message.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.725
What's up?
Glad you came.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.059
Do you know
who this is?

27:40.092 --> 27:41.894
Yeah. T-Lock.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.363
What's --
What's going on?

27:44.396 --> 27:45.998
Walk with me.

27:46.032 --> 27:49.201
Your babysitter, Max,
I saw her mother today.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.137
How'd that happen?
She called the station.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.705
T-Lock is either missing
or, most likely,

27:52.739 --> 27:55.041
skipped town.
Why would he skip town?

27:55.074 --> 27:58.010
Well, apparently he found
a bag of drugs.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.179
Yeah. That bag.
Wait, what?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.214
And the mother's story
is all over the place.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.716
Definitely didn't tell me
everything she knew.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.384
Did she mention
anything about Max?

28:05.417 --> 28:07.386
She went out of her way
saying Max didn't know anything.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.555
Great,
so she's covering for her.

28:09.588 --> 28:12.258
Why?
Max is a good kid.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.093
I don't know,
but I need to bring in Max

28:14.126 --> 28:16.062
as well as her friend Harper
in for questioning.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.096
I need to be there.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.564
Okay,
before we bring them in,

28:18.597 --> 28:20.232
I need the results
from the fingerprints.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.568
Jenny, really?
I need to be sure.
These are kids.

28:22.601 --> 28:23.702
I'll call you later.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.875
How could
he have escaped?!

28:28.908 --> 28:30.709
I don't know.
The lock was broken,

28:30.743 --> 28:32.912
and the key to the collar
is missing from the bedroom.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.246
Scarlet must have
taken it.

28:34.280 --> 28:37.116
Is this true?
And before you lie to me,

28:37.149 --> 28:40.252
keep in mind,
I can see everything --

28:40.286 --> 28:43.923
rocks, trees,
your thin, sad lies.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.259
It's true.
It's true.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.061
But I only did it
so he could get Phoebe.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.063
I needed to
make my family whole.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.564
Why didn't you
go with him?

28:52.598 --> 28:54.400
Because I believe your treatment
is helping him.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.402
He's bringing her here.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.907
You have doomed him, girl.
Maybe all of us.

29:00.940 --> 29:03.609
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find him
before he does any damage.

29:03.642 --> 29:07.579
Let me come with you.
No. You're the only reason why
he won't disappear completely.

29:07.613 --> 29:09.215
Lock her in her room.

29:09.248 --> 29:13.552
And, Aggie, when I return,
I want a full accounting.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.490
Come, dear.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.102
Are we there yet?

29:30.136 --> 29:31.303
Not yet.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.272

No.

Bridger.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.281
Oh, my God!

35:27.159 --> 35:29.094

to drink? Water?

to toast with?

Yep.

Lager.
Mm.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.139
What are we toasting to?

35:41.173 --> 35:43.642
The ranch is ours.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.445
Are you serious?
What about the other buyer?

35:46.478 --> 35:47.679
There was
a higher offer,

35:47.713 --> 35:50.216
but my personal letter
won them over.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.717
I told you,
meant to be!

35:52.751 --> 35:55.387
Wow.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.523

a fancy ranch owner,

35:57.556 --> 36:00.526

to fix the boiler?

36:00.559 --> 36:01.893
I'll see what I can do.

36:20.412 --> 36:23.882
Pilot's on.
Everything looks fine.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.219
Could be the condensate pipe's
seized up.

36:27.253 --> 36:28.587

to help?

36:28.620 --> 36:29.855
I can handle it
from here.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.223
Should be
pretty straightforward.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.924
You sure?
Could keep you company.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.361
I'm sure.
I got everything I need.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.095
You just get home safe,
and don't worry,

36:37.128 --> 36:39.565
I will lock up.
I'll see you at the house.

36:39.598 --> 36:40.566
Mnh.

36:40.599 --> 36:41.733
Oh, don't wait up.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.034
After I get
this sucker fixed,

36:43.068 --> 36:44.370
I got poker night
with the boys.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.704
Right.

36:45.737 --> 36:48.874
Ahh.
That's strange.

36:48.907 --> 36:50.709
What's that?

36:50.742 --> 36:52.344
Something's up
with this door handle.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.713
The door won't close.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.215
Yeah,
it's pretty old.

36:57.249 --> 36:59.084
I'll take a look at it
while I'm here.

36:59.117 --> 37:02.254

Hey.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.290

38:50.429 --> 38:51.697
What?

39:21.927 --> 39:23.995
Did you come
for my daughter?

39:24.029 --> 39:26.164
I see she still thinks
about me.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.666
I think about her, too.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.935
I think about
how I'll never be free

39:29.968 --> 39:32.337
as long as she keeps
looking for me.

39:32.370 --> 39:36.442
You don't deserve
to be free.

39:36.475 --> 39:37.943
You're a monster.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.045
I am <i>not</i> a monster.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.616
You don't need that.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.452
I'm not
going to hurt you.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.757
I'm going to leave.

39:54.292 --> 39:56.462
Tell her to stop
looking for me.
