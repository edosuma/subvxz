WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:10.885
So we're cursed.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.470
-We are.
-What's the plan?

00:13.513 --> 00:16.266
Well, the last time I was cursed--
I don't freaking know!

00:16.349 --> 00:19.227
-You're the goat of solving things.
-I am the greatest of all time.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.478
No, like a <i>goat </i>goat.

00:20.562 --> 00:22.731
When you get something,
you chew the hell out of it.

00:22.814 --> 00:23.773
Not this time.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.735
This is a group curse
and a group problem to fix.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.446
Great, because I recently heard
about a local <i>bruja</i>,

00:29.529 --> 00:31.281
who has a sizable following on TikTok--

00:31.364 --> 00:32.991
We're not solving this on TikTok, dummy.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.869
Did you just call me dummy?

00:35.952 --> 00:40.707
No. Demi, which sounds like dummy,
but TikTok is not a real resource.

00:40.790 --> 00:43.209
We need a real plan to figure out a plan
to reverse this curse.

00:43.293 --> 00:48.131
So, everyone, go home, get some sleep,
and be prepared to shoulder the burden

00:48.214 --> 00:51.051
because I have too much on my plate.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.343
Like what?

00:52.427 --> 00:55.555
Um, cancer. My dad. He has it!

00:55.638 --> 00:58.725
Love you. Bye.
And please take the box with you.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.227
We already have enough bad juju here. Now…

01:07.275 --> 01:08.151
I gotta pee.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.908
-Ines!

01:16.493 --> 01:18.787
-Oh my God.
-I know. We're all dummies.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.372
Yes, but Tonio intercepted
the call for Dad.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.333
Dad doesn't know he has cancer.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.460
-Shit.
-Yeah.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.463
How you gonna tell him?

01:39.974 --> 01:40.892
Oh, I got it.

01:40.975 --> 01:44.104
-No, I do. I'm better at pouring.
-No, you're a stingy pourer.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.191
What is going on with you two?

01:48.691 --> 01:52.278
That's my favorite disappointed face
that you make. Can you make it again?

01:57.283 --> 01:58.409
I'm gonna change.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.911
Oh, do you need help?

01:59.994 --> 02:02.122
No. No.

02:07.877 --> 02:11.047
So should we talk about
a payment plan for your debt?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.383
You forgave our debt last night.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.426
That was the cancer shock talking.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.388
And how dare you use my words against me
in a vulnerable moment?

02:18.471 --> 02:20.932
-I just found out my brother has cancer--
-Sh!

02:21.015 --> 02:24.310
Shit! He doesn't know
because I took the call and--

02:24.394 --> 02:26.729
Who and how are we gonna tell him?

02:26.813 --> 02:29.649
Every day that he doesn't know
is a day he's not getting cured,

02:29.732 --> 02:31.901
is a day he's not working
on his bucket list.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.654
Is a day he's drinking sugary juice,
death liquid.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.448
And a day that we're getting in trouble
for not telling him.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.285
You know what happens
when he takes my phone away. I take yours.

02:40.368 --> 02:43.121
We need to stop talking and start telling.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.209
-Bye, Tonio!
-Let us know how it goes.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.635
I love the girls,
but we both know Gloria called me dummy.

02:57.719 --> 02:59.846
And I know
she's under a lot of stress right now,

02:59.929 --> 03:01.222
but she should be leaning on me.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.684
The afterlife is my domain.
Why do we have to groupthink it?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.103
Or let Gloria dictate what we should do?

03:07.187 --> 03:09.272
I mean,
it's like there's a building on fire,

03:09.355 --> 03:11.399
and instead of
looking to the fire marshal,

03:11.482 --> 03:12.901
you call in a dolphin trainer.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.279
Am I being cruel to Andre?
You know, stringing him along?

03:16.362 --> 03:19.157
I feel like
she's marginalizing my expertise.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.534
Like,
even a YouTube-taught star witch knows

03:21.618 --> 03:24.871
that in order to reverse the curse,
you have to know what kind of curse it is.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.289
Not all curses are the same.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.958
You've got, ugh, vendettas,
green-eyed monsters,

03:29.042 --> 03:32.212
demon cats, possessions,
religion-based, land-based.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.214
Oh my God, it's so much.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.466
Yes, it's complicated.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.762
It's a science, except harder
because it actually matters.

03:40.845 --> 03:42.513
-We'll never figure it out.
-We might not.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.267
-That's why we should leave it to Gloria.
-Morning, power walkers.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.437
Bye, Mom.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.022
Okay, baby. Bye.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.067
Why so serious?

03:55.693 --> 03:56.527
Uh…

03:56.611 --> 03:58.696
Hello? What?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.616
The house is on fire,
and there's a dolphin emergency?

04:02.242 --> 04:03.076
I'm sorry, guys.

04:03.159 --> 04:06.246
I really gotta take this privately,
but I'll meet you at school, okay?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.415
There he goes.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.751
Adding another brick
to his emotional wall.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.086
It's definitely getting thick.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.713
Right? I've been dying
to talk to someone about this.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.756
You and Cam are close.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.300
If he's pulling away from me,
how do I get through to him?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.386
Maybe you try giving him space.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.388
Set him free so he comes back to me.
I like.

04:23.471 --> 04:24.889
But I think our problems run deeper.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.641
-Can I confide in you?
-Uh-uh.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.101
Oh God, I'm under such a Cam spell.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.270
It can only be broken
with a true love's kiss,

04:30.353 --> 04:32.397
which I'll never get
'cause I'm not his true love.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.234
We're working through it. I need to get
him over that person he's hung up on.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.027
Oh, that.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.113
Yeah. It's complicated.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.156
-But what did he tell you?
-Not much.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.617
Basically, he's still stuck on someone BA.

04:45.827 --> 04:47.954
Before Andre. I think they still talk.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.914
Oh, I know who it is.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.501
Of course you do. You're his bestie.
God, I just feel so awful for him.

04:53.584 --> 04:54.502
Why?

04:54.585 --> 04:57.714
Because that person scarred him.
And now he can't trust anyone, i.e. me.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.799
I mean, can you imagine? I trust everyone.

04:59.882 --> 05:00.925
Scarred?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.761
Maybe I don't know who it is.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.306
Well, who the hell is it?
And why don't I know?

05:06.389 --> 05:09.976
Well, if you ever find out,
don't tell me because I will poison them.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.522
It finally hit me
that Gloria isn't gonna empower me

05:14.605 --> 05:16.607
because, on some level,
she doesn't trust me,

05:16.691 --> 05:19.277
and she doesn't trust me
because I'm not direct enough.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.820
I don't self-advocate.

05:20.903 --> 05:21.779
Very insightful.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.033
-Do you trust me?
-You're my emergency contact.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.910
Would you tell me
if you were scarred by someone?

05:27.994 --> 05:30.663
Because scars only heal
with vitamin E and talking.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.249
He can't tell. He'll never tell.
I'm gonna have to do it for him.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.377
-What are you doing?
-Apparently, everything. Again.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.213
What about Lucia? It'll be a twofer.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.175
She'll tell him,
and then he dumps her for telling him.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.552
-So smart.
-Well done, Gloria. You did it again.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.180
Uh, what did you do?
Oh, is Lucia code for the curse?

05:47.263 --> 05:48.222
She is a curse.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.641
We're talking curse.
Advocate! Now's the time!

05:50.725 --> 05:53.561
Gloria! I would like to take
more of a leadership position

05:53.644 --> 05:56.522
to help the cause, as I do feel like
I have the most experience.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.192
You know, it's pretty accurate.
You are naturally depressing.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.693
And our dad already hates you.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.445
-Your dad hates me?
-Maybe it should be Cam.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.155
He can't even break up with Andre.

06:04.238 --> 06:07.992
We need more options. Let's go, Ines.
I do my best thinking when I'm walking.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.243
The toilet's your think tank.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.454
Which is why
we're walking towards the bathroom!

06:12.747 --> 06:14.499
I can't believe
she completely dismissed me.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.210
She doesn't get to dismiss me.
That's bullshit. I dismiss her.

06:17.293 --> 06:20.004
I… I think she might've been
talking about her dad's cancer.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.048
She's not. She's dismissing me.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.342
So we're dividing and conquering.

06:24.425 --> 06:27.929
And we're gonna conquer and/or divide
to figure out this curse and reverse it.

06:28.012 --> 06:28.971
That sounded great!

06:29.806 --> 06:31.015
What does it mean?

06:31.099 --> 06:32.475
We need more information.

06:32.558 --> 06:35.436
We need to find our ghost's obit.
It's gonna tell us everything!

06:38.272 --> 06:40.316
It says nothing. The obit is garbage.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.611
I know. All we know
is that her name was Marisol Martinez.

06:43.694 --> 06:46.614
She had no surviving family,
except her son and his family,

06:46.697 --> 06:48.658
and was loved, blah blah blah blah.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.993
She was loved and had a lot of lovers.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.704
-Like you?
-Like me?

06:53.788 --> 06:57.375
I can't assume that I know everything.
So I assume you've had your share.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.668
I'm only 15.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.462
And how are we defining lovers?
I mean, does Mr. Waffles count?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.714
What are you doing with Mr. Waffles?

07:03.798 --> 07:04.632
Loving him.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.552
Jesus, I do not touch my dog

07:07.635 --> 07:10.847
except in normal petting ways
and the occasional mouth kiss,

07:10.930 --> 07:12.640
but the peanut butter stays on the spoon.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.934
I already knew all that.
So I know everything.

07:15.017 --> 07:16.769
-Ugh, no, you don't.
-But I should.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.940
Just in case
I have to write your obituary one day.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.442
You don't need to include lovers.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.570
And actually, isn't it weird that
they included that about the old lady?

07:25.653 --> 07:27.113
Cam, why are you holding back?

07:27.196 --> 07:28.990
I know there's something
you're not telling me.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.492
Of course there is.
I mean, there's more than one thing.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.744
Well, that's not fair!
I tell you everything!

07:33.828 --> 07:34.954
Which I never asked for.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.457
I mean, there are things
I wish you never told me.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.791
Like what?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.294
I'll never tell.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.714
Hey, what's the word?

07:44.797 --> 07:46.883
Is your cousin
still doing singing telegrams?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.051
-Not after he spread all that Covid.
-<i>Damn it.</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:50.553
We found the ghost's obit,

07:50.636 --> 07:53.806
and it confirmed that the old lady we saw
is not alive. She's dead.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.392
<i>Yeah, we know.</i>
<i>This is not new information.</i>

07:56.476 --> 07:59.103
That's what that yard sale lady told us.
What else?

07:59.187 --> 08:03.191
We're, um, heading
to the ghost family's house right now

08:03.274 --> 08:06.319
to interrogate them and get more info
on the dead lady/ghost.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.403
Whatever.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.199
I gotta go.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.912
Did you tell Dad he has cancer yet?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.413
-No.
-Of course.

08:17.497 --> 08:18.998
Because in typical fashion,

08:19.081 --> 08:21.709
you "Tonio-ed" the situation
and put it on me.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.337
But this is on you.
You intercepted the call.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.505
On your behalf.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.840
-Besides the point.
-I'll handle it.

08:27.924 --> 08:28.925
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.177
Way ahead of you.
Plan's already in motion.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.136
Pizza boat?

08:32.845 --> 08:34.597
-Oh! Uh…

08:34.680 --> 08:37.975
What the hell is he doing here?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.644
This is Tonio's assistant.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.271
Assistant for what? You don't have a job.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.857
You don't need to have a job
to have an assistant.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.860
-I'm Rusty.
-Oh, we already know each other.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.154
She's gonna do it!
She's really gonna do it!

08:50.238 --> 08:51.489
Ten more seconds!

08:51.572 --> 08:54.075
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

08:56.244 --> 08:57.078
Oh!

08:58.496 --> 08:59.372
Pass it back.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.916
Sorry, I don't remember.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.000
It just happened.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.961
Today!

09:05.962 --> 09:07.088
My God, you are such a--

09:08.089 --> 09:09.465
Wait.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.261
You didn't give my uncle
your social security number, did you?

09:13.761 --> 09:14.929
Not yet.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.847
Well, don't.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.141
That's no way to treat
the person who built your credit.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.393
I'm not paying him. You are.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.437
You're paying Rusty until we're settled up
with what you owe me.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.648
This is ridiculous. Rusty's gotta go.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.026
Fine. Then he can't tell your dad
he has cancer.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.241
What's the plan?

09:36.993 --> 09:40.162
Oh, don't go all Gloria on me.
I don't answer to you or her.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.165
We've been standing here for ten minutes,
okay. So I'm just wondering if--

09:43.249 --> 09:46.085
If I have a plan? Yes, I have one.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.712
Can you share it?

09:48.212 --> 09:49.088
I don't know.

09:49.171 --> 09:52.592
Might be a secret
since I apparently share too many.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.303
Maybe it's time
to keep some in my own vault.

09:59.223 --> 10:00.600
Right on schedule.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.437
Now what?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.773
Bum-rush 'em!

10:09.400 --> 10:10.901
-They're bum-rushing us!
-What?

10:13.946 --> 10:15.281
-What do you want?
-Information.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.034
Wait a minute. You're that kid
that came looking for Marisol.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.952
-Yes.
-What do you want with my mom?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.622
We're just trying to figure out
why she's haunting us.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.789
This is nonsense.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.125
I have ice cream to put in the fridge.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.588
You've seen her too?
I thought I saw her a few times.

10:30.671 --> 10:33.090
In the backyard.
Outside my bedroom window.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.635
At the Tommy's drive-through!
What have you seen?

10:36.302 --> 10:37.845
Just her. She wants her box back.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.264
But before we give it back,
we need information about it

10:40.348 --> 10:42.016
because she cursed us.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.644
Don't wanna give the box back,
but keep the curse, you know?

10:45.519 --> 10:46.354
What box?

10:46.437 --> 10:49.190
Uh, I bought it at your yard sale.
It had the initials MM on it--

10:49.273 --> 10:53.027
Geny! Did you sell my mother's box?
I told you not to sell it!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.446
Mm-mm, no. <i>No tengo tiempo.</i>

10:55.529 --> 10:58.199
If my mom says
that she wants the box back,

10:58.282 --> 11:00.034
then I should take it.
I'll give you a refund.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.037
Uh, well, not to be an asshole,
but you're not your mom.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.623
So giving it to you
negates giving it back to her.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.668
We don't want it back.
You can keep the box and the curse.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.671
Geny! This is no longer
your business or concern.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.255
You can't talk to me like that.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.716
-I asked you not to sell!
-Do you hear yourself?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.344
-You sound insane!
-It's the one thing! The one thing!

11:20.680 --> 11:22.056
Sidebar, now!

11:24.350 --> 11:26.852
He's an asshole,
and the asshole's not telling Dad.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.688
He doesn't even know Dad.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.315
Which is exactly why
he's the perfect person for the job.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.943
There's no emotional baggage.
He'll just get it done.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.654
Get it done? This is gonna be devastating.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.323
It has to be done
with the utmost care and decency,

11:39.407 --> 11:41.242
which this kid has none of.

11:41.325 --> 11:46.122
This guy is callous, selfish,
has zero EQ, and terrible aim.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.332
I'm really confused by this job.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.127
Am I being fired?
Because I haven't really started yet.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.712
-No!
-Yes!

11:52.795 --> 11:54.672
-Still not clear.
-Read the room, Rusty.

11:54.755 --> 11:55.965
I'm trying to.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.218
Stay there.
My pull-aside with you isn't done yet.

11:59.301 --> 12:02.221
Slow your roll, sis.
You are messing up a prime opportunity.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.598
That smooth brain telling Dad
isn't a prime opportunity.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.560
I'm not talking about Dad.
I'm talking about me.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.437
Rusty.

12:10.020 --> 12:10.855
Oh.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.484
You're ruining my chance
to date an upperclassman.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.155
I'm pretty sure he hangs out with Eddie,
and Eddie throws the best parties.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.283
Can we finish? I have to take a dump.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.200
Ew.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.745
-Stay put. We're not done yet.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.498
-What do you want?
-I have a plan to reverse the curse.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.083
Shit!

12:31.167 --> 12:34.170
I've been so consumed with the cancer,
I forgot about the curse.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.297
In my room.

12:37.047 --> 12:41.093
Everyone else, stay in your positions.
I'll be right back.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.432
-What do you got?
-Excuse me?

12:46.515 --> 12:49.602
I am not gonna walk you through
all the details of Operation Bum-Rush

12:49.685 --> 12:52.062
if you're not gonna take
a respectful tone with me.

12:52.146 --> 12:56.192
You haven't spent one minute
helping with the curse today,

12:56.275 --> 13:01.155
which you don't really need to
because this is my world and wheelhouse

13:01.238 --> 13:04.533
and I'm not an irresponsible asshat
like your sister, okay?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.203
Yes. I love this color on you,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.080
and I give you full responsibility
and authority

13:10.164 --> 13:12.416
to lead us out of the darkness
and into the light,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.919
especially given all that's going on
outside that door now.

13:15.002 --> 13:17.129
So what's next? What do we need to do?

13:18.005 --> 13:20.925
A leave-out ceremony.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.635
That's not a real thing.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.429
Are you seriously questioning me
right now?

13:25.513 --> 13:27.223
It's basic ghost knowledge.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.934
You can't just throw shit up in the air.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.352
Ghosts don't catch.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.313
It all makes sense. What's the ceremony?

13:35.189 --> 13:38.400
So, I verified directly
with the ghost's family

13:38.484 --> 13:41.612
that the box was important to the ghost,
and we need to give it back.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.740
We do the leave-out ceremony
because, as I said, ghosts don't catch,

13:44.824 --> 13:45.866
and we have a curse.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.828
So the ceremony protects us
from giving back the box

13:48.911 --> 13:50.454
but keeping the curse.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.499
And before you ask,
the answer is basic curse knowledge.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.876
Actually, it's more
intermediate curse knowledge,

13:55.960 --> 13:59.380
but I'm dumbing it down in layman's terms,
so it's basically basic.

14:00.464 --> 14:01.507
Hm.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.343
Great. Let's do the ceremony.
Get Cam and the box.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.344
Done.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.097
-What'd Gloria say?
-<i>Come over.</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:11.267
-We're gonna do a leave-out ceremony.
-Leave me out.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.310
-Plus, it's not a thing.
-<i>Yes, it is.</i>

14:13.394 --> 14:15.688
-Bring the box.
-<i>I don't have it. You do.</i>

14:15.771 --> 14:16.730
I do?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

14:16.814 --> 14:19.441
Gloria said to take it last night,
and I didn't, which means you did.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.736
Right. Yes, I definitely took the box.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.865
-<i>Cool, see you soon.</i>

14:25.948 --> 14:28.075
I just don't remember,

14:28.158 --> 14:32.246
so it's probably somewhere still in here.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.048
You have it.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.425
Always, since birth.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.386
I've always had the it factor,
but that's not why I'm calling.

14:47.469 --> 14:49.597
I have important info
about what we were talking about.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.181
<i>You know who scarred Cam?</i>

14:51.265 --> 14:55.477
<i>No. That's your job to figure out.</i>
<i>But when you do, I've decided I'm open.</i>

14:55.561 --> 14:57.313
I think I can handle knowing who it is.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.732
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I have box problems.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.984
Ew. Can't help with that. Bye!

15:04.653 --> 15:05.988
Where are you, box?

15:07.656 --> 15:11.410
I don't know, Demi.
A pre-leave-out ceremony?

15:11.493 --> 15:12.328
Yes.

15:12.411 --> 15:16.832
In my excitement about the leave-out,
I forgot about the starter step.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.710
It's gonna help us
cleanse all the bad juju we carry

15:19.793 --> 15:20.920
so the ghost feels safe.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.046
The ghost has feelings?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.965
-Of course.
-How long does the cleansing take?

15:25.049 --> 15:28.052
It's gonna be, like, 24,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.054
maybe 48 hours

15:30.137 --> 15:31.180
for me to find the

15:32.389 --> 15:37.019
wisdom that we'll need
to feel safe before leaving out the box.

15:37.102 --> 15:40.314
It's all under the heading
of advanced curse knowledge,

15:40.397 --> 15:42.691
which I teeter on having.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.985
I'm still firmly intermediary.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.904
Okay, what do we do first?

15:47.529 --> 15:50.074
We unload secrets,

15:50.157 --> 15:52.993
preferably deep, dark ones, like…

15:53.786 --> 15:54.620
I don't know.

15:54.703 --> 15:58.707
Like, why your dad
might hate one of your closest friends,

15:58.791 --> 16:02.419
or if you were in love and then scarred

16:02.503 --> 16:05.047
and afraid to love again,
confessing who did that to you.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.049
-Cam, you go first.
-No. I'll start.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.301
I accidentally
almost killed my pet hamster.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.555
Okay, it wasn't my hamster. It was Gloria.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.933
Mm. Thank you for sharing. Cam?

16:16.016 --> 16:19.478
Uh, yeah. I actually do have a tragic tale
of rejection that nobody knows about.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.355
Yes, keep talking.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.856
-Gloria--
-Not now, Javi!

16:22.940 --> 16:24.608
It's time for everyone to go home.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.318
Sorry, Mr. Salazar.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.363
-I didn't mean any disrespect.
-Good night.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.120
We really need to have a talk
about the company you keep.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.456
Yeah, a hard talk is definitely in order
for the both of us.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.086
Okay… …my daughter.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.296
I'm all ears.
What do you wanna tell me?

16:47.339 --> 16:48.465
Daddy, you ha…

16:51.510 --> 16:53.595
It's okay. Get it out.

16:58.058 --> 17:02.062
Tonio intercepted a call,
and it was to tell you, y…

17:04.523 --> 17:06.483
-Take your time.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.735
Maybe with water.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.319
Yeah.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.237
Be right back.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.911
Hey, what's up with the cake?

17:17.995 --> 17:20.497
-Dad's favorite. Mexican chocolate.
-Rusty picked it up.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.541
Oh, this is genius,
and just in the nick of time,

17:22.624 --> 17:25.461
'cause I was starting to lose it out there
having to tell him by myself.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.881
But now I don't have to,
because we'll tell him together

17:28.964 --> 17:30.883
after he eats his favorite cake.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.053
Or with it.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.183
This is messed up.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.478
We've gotten so caught up
in the task of telling him

17:42.561 --> 17:45.647
that we completely lost sight
of the fact that he's sick.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.902
Our dad is sick, and not with a minor cold
but with major cancer.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.491
No one should be in your shoes.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.867
Or his.

17:57.534 --> 18:02.039
It's just a cruel irony that he now
has cancer after losing his wife to it.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.084
-Seriously. What a challenge to be--
-Left alone.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.005
To raise two little girls on his own.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.715
That man is a hero.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.175
He's <i>my </i>hero.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.679
See? I bet you were carrying
the weight of the world in worry,

18:17.763 --> 18:20.224
wondering how you'll recover
if something happens to him.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.772
And I'm so sorry
you're going through this, Gloria.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.862
Me too.

18:41.578 --> 18:45.707
Thank you for saying what you said
and seeing what I'm feeling.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.793
Yeah.

18:51.672 --> 18:54.174
I'm really overwhelmed.

18:55.008 --> 18:56.468
As anyone would be.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.848
Sorry. I've been such a bitch.

19:01.807 --> 19:02.933
I was wrong.

19:03.016 --> 19:06.311
You should definitely be the one
to tell my dad he has cancer.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.437
Don't have to.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.273
You just did.

19:14.862 --> 19:17.406
-Mm. Thank you.
-Is this your third helping?

19:17.489 --> 19:20.659
No judgment.
I'm the one with cancer. Remember?

19:21.535 --> 19:22.452
Too soon.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.705
So, how long have you known?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.792
-A month, give or take a week or two.
-And you didn't think to tell us?

19:28.876 --> 19:30.294
I didn't wanna worry you.

19:30.377 --> 19:34.256
Look, the doctor said
it was slow growing and not aggressive.

19:34.339 --> 19:35.632
It's gonna be fine.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.094
But I do have one important question
that begs an answer.

19:39.678 --> 19:40.512
Who are you?

19:43.265 --> 19:45.684
"I'm a dummy, a disaster."

19:45.767 --> 19:48.437
"I can't remember where I left the box."

19:48.520 --> 19:49.354
"Don't kill me

19:49.438 --> 19:52.065
because the ghost will do it first
when she comes for the box!"

19:53.400 --> 19:55.694
-Exclamation or no exclamation?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.827
-Glo, I have bad news.
-<i>Me first, 'cause mine's good.</i>

20:03.911 --> 20:05.829
My dad's cancer's not fatal,
so we're not cursed.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.706
We don't have to undo anything anymore.

20:07.789 --> 20:08.999
Yay!

20:09.082 --> 20:11.585
<i>Thanks for bearing the load today</i>
<i>while I was distracted.</i>

20:11.668 --> 20:14.463
I appreciate how responsible you are.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.924
And I appreciate your appreciation.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.967
-Good night.
-<i>Night.</i>

20:20.844 --> 20:21.887
Delete.

20:23.889 --> 20:24.806
Hey.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.227
Did you, uh, hear about
the cancer and the curse?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.729
-She called you first?
-Of course.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.358
Did you get robbed?

20:34.441 --> 20:38.362
I was looking for something
that I suddenly don't need to find.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.531
-I'll clean it up.
-Good, because this is so not you.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.033
How do you know? Maybe it is.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.077
Maybe it's a secret me
that you don't know,

20:45.160 --> 20:47.287
because you think
you know everything, but you don't.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.206
Wait.
I don't know that you're secretly messy?

20:50.457 --> 20:52.834
Are you really gonna make me
talk about my feelings right now?

20:55.087 --> 20:58.465
Ah. Okay. Now you're pretending
like you don't care, but you do care.

21:00.592 --> 21:04.137
Oh, why do you have to beat me down
like this? Okay. Okay. Okay.

21:04.221 --> 21:08.809
Look. I know that… that you wanna know
all my secrets, and the truth is, you do.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.311
You know all the secrets
that I'm willing to share.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.730
But there are some that are in a vault,

21:13.814 --> 21:15.440
where I feel comfortable keeping them.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.859
And it's not a reflection of you.
It's about me.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.946
Even though it's important
for you to tell me everything about you

21:21.029 --> 21:25.450
and for you to know
everything about me, I'm not you.

21:26.034 --> 21:27.828
I'm honored you shared so much with me.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.082
-I know that was hard for you.
-It was.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.584
Yeah, but I'm also questioning

21:34.668 --> 21:37.004
how old those Hot Pockets were
that I had before coming over.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.422
Can I lay down? Thanks.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.842
No, I should probably go home.

21:43.468 --> 21:47.014
I'm sorry. I was so selfish
to insist on knowing everything.

21:50.684 --> 21:55.022
Sometimes I just feel like
an afterthought to our friends,

21:55.105 --> 21:58.483
and I… I get sensitive

21:58.567 --> 22:00.027
and maybe jealous.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.613
Okay, definitely jealous

22:03.697 --> 22:08.076
at the idea
that somebody knows you better than me.

22:10.078 --> 22:11.371
And that there are

22:12.664 --> 22:14.916
secrets between us.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.587
No one knows me better than you.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.674
And no one cares about you more than me.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.722
No. No. No. No crying.

22:28.805 --> 22:31.558
I can't… I can't handle it.
I can't handle the crying.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.521
Fine. Fine. One question, Demi.
You get one question.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.690
Just one to ask,
whatever it is that you wanna ask

22:38.774 --> 22:41.526
that you think you don't know,
but only because you're crying,

22:41.610 --> 22:43.362
and no discussion or follow-up.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.282
You think Mr. Martin's got
a full head of hair under his hat?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.533
No. No way. It's a skullet.

22:50.118 --> 22:53.663
But that's not the question
that you wanna ask.

22:56.124 --> 22:59.753
Fine. Andre said you were hung up
on someone that scarred you.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.005
Who?

23:04.883 --> 23:06.009
You.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.515
-No real cancer.
-And no real curse.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.308
-I'm so happy.
-Me too.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.770
I can't believe Demi got us
to believe that stupid box was cursed.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.065
Let's get these great minds to bed.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.817
We have a curse-free day to conquer.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.068
Ten more minutes.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.362
-Okay.
-Yes!

23:25.445 --> 23:27.155
Ines.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.950
Yep, there we go.
