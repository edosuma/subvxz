I invite you to meet my family.

07:12.413 --> 07:14.327
- I trust you.
- We'll split up.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.369
you're going to split up.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.598
Why not tell the truth?

07:21.107 --> 07:23.098
Because you never sleep with me.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.640
Suck your music!

Yes, I am doing okay.

08:32.544 --> 08:33.912
Forgive me.

08:33.947 --> 08:38.145
I'm always a little emotional
if it arrived during menstruation.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.558
Tell me about it.

08:48.995 --> 08:53.591
Try to spend the first day of the cycle on a 14 hour flight to Tokyo.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.299

09:03.309 --> 09:04.609
What is this?

09:04.644 --> 09:06.976
friend of the flight attendants.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.013
In a profession for me, I have to smile ...

09:09.048 --> 09:11.243
no matter what hormones do.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.866
Josh, if it continues ...

09:28.901 --> 09:31.031
I could even go with you to Chicago.

09:31.066 --> 09:33.161

09:34.040 --> 09:37.237
Well, there are hotels within five minutes from here.

09:39.646 --> 09:40.943

09:41.814 --> 09:43.008

09:45.885 --> 09:47.045
Well!

09:49.956 --> 09:52.618

09:55.094 --> 09:56.694
my best friend's sister.

09:56.729 --> 09:59.766
He also will go to a wedding in Chicago.

09:59.801 --> 10:02.233

10:02.268 --> 10:05.260

10:08.041 --> 10:11.272

- Yes but...

10:12.779 --> 10:14.838
Forgive me.
Do not know what happened.

10:15.581 --> 10:17.947
I think he was an overdose of the
ecstasy or something.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.511
Good ..

10:20.887 --> 10:23.321
I can certainly give you some ecstasy for ...

10:24.824 --> 10:27.292
the good old way.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.001
Come on!

10:49.415 --> 10:52.018

10:52.053 --> 10:53.251
Okay.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.722
- I'm sorry but ...
- I forgive you.

10:55.757 --> 10:57.121
- But I...
- I forgive you.

10:57.790 --> 11:01.419
Try to think of something fun, right?
As...

11:02.128 --> 11:04.824
Are you going to your mother's wedding.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.758
- His second marriage.
- Anything.

11:08.167 --> 11:11.204
It does not fit with what I want to happen today ...

11:11.239 --> 11:12.637
but I did not cry.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.340
Forget it.
you would not understand.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.141
I hate when girls say ...

11:17.176 --> 11:19.644
I do not understand.
What does this mean?

11:19.679 --> 11:23.516
you would not understand
pressure into the last unmarried daughter ...

11:23.551 --> 11:25.116
In an Irish Catholic family

11:25.151 --> 11:28.521
I do not understand pressure?
My parents were devout Jews.

11:28.556 --> 11:30.853
"When are you going to get married
When are you going to get married "

11:31.257 --> 11:33.282
I should have known he was married.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.562
- I feel like an idiot.
- No, Molly.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.728
Molly, you're not stupid.

11:41.100 --> 11:44.570
If there is someone who is stupid,
The bastard liar and a jerk.

11:44.605 --> 11:46.629
I know. I know.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.534
If you know, then why
still crying?

11:51.077 --> 11:53.613
And if that bastard
liar and a jerk ...

11:53.648 --> 11:55.548
he is the best that I can find?

11:55.583 --> 11:58.351
No, Come on, Molly.

You are funny.
You smell good.

12:10.496 --> 12:14.956

12:20.072 --> 12:23.530
And you're really conscious!
Extraordinary!

12:25.878 --> 12:26.844
Hi, Mom.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.447
Thank you, God.
He is still alive!

12:29.482 --> 12:31.283
Why do you think I'm dead?

12:31.318 --> 12:33.333
because you're supposed to be here now!

12:33.368 --> 12:35.349
- The flight was delayed.
- And did not you call?

12:36.622 --> 12:38.283
I'm very busy.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.629
- That's how long to do it!
- Mom, what adai problem?

12:43.664 --> 12:49.902
Nothing. I'm just upset because ...
thought you would come tonight.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.206
- You're a terrible liar.
- I do not lie.

12:53.241 --> 12:55.606
- It is okay.
- Is everything okay?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.743
Mother, now
really scared me.

12:57.778 --> 12:58.976
Will you tell me what's wrong there ...

12:59.011 --> 13:00.680
or I should ask for dad
to tell it?

13:00.715 --> 13:01.746
Talk back with Josh?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.147
I was on the phone with Josh.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.918
He could not hear me.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.754
I bought a hearing aid,
but he did not use it.

13:08.789 --> 13:09.754
Pick up the phone!

13:09.789 --> 13:11.347
You think I'm that I'm doing?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.058
What do you tell him?

13:14.093 --> 13:16.107
you say do not tell him over the phone.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.122
- Tell me what?
- I go.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.623
father?

13:22.869 --> 13:24.427
Yes, I'm still here.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.474
But, according to doctors,
will not be much longer.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.441
What?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.967
it is an acute disease, Josh ...

13:33.946 --> 13:36.113
and there is no magic pill ...

13:36.148 --> 13:38.810
or injection that can change it.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.050
<I> Oh ,. My God. </ I>

13:41.354 --> 13:43.151
it is the end, right?

13:43.523 --> 13:46.117
father, wait !.
Stop talking like that.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.956
Speaking like what?
This is how I talk.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.988
Frankly...

13:55.434 --> 13:57.768
I have only one regret.

13:57.803 --> 14:02.536
How it would be nice to know
women who will one day be your wife.

14:04.544 --> 14:05.772
dad

14:12.685 --> 14:13.913
father?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.253
What if...

14:22.194 --> 14:24.253
What if I told you that I've found.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.223
Who?

14:32.004 --> 14:33.062
Molly.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.304
Molly.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.546
Molly.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.142
Molly.

14:46.586 --> 14:47.712
Molly!

14:52.391 --> 14:54.450
- How did I get here?
- I brought you here.

15:00.232 --> 15:02.166
But I want to sit by the window.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.629
Yeah, well ...

15:04.937 --> 15:08.040
I want to get on a plane without saliva best friend's sister.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.235
for three hours, but here we are now.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.781
Okay. you're very fierce.

15:15.816 --> 15:17.348
Is it true? I wonder why?

15:17.383 --> 15:20.686
Maybe because I was drinking whiskey with
cereal for breakfast.

15:20.721 --> 15:23.155
- I'm having a lot of headaches.
- My boyfriend is married.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.147
Perhaps knowing
that my dad had cancer.

15:29.028 --> 15:30.222
What?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.067
They call me when you're sleeping.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.965
He has six months to live.

15:43.809 --> 15:45.436
Forgive me.

15:51.384 --> 15:55.150
If you need anything, I'm here.

15:57.657 --> 16:01.115
Actually, there is something.

16:06.065 --> 16:07.131
What?

16:07.166 --> 16:10.795
Why did you tell your parents
that we are engaged?

16:12.938 --> 16:14.872
Hi, sir. How are you?
Thank you.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.241
- I did something wrong today?
- no

16:17.276 --> 16:20.179
I'm strange because
drug stewardess gave me ...

16:20.214 --> 16:22.248
and do not remember much
from what I had said.

16:22.283 --> 16:23.408
What?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.552
I only hope
that he would be happy to hear it!

16:26.587 --> 16:28.986
like you did.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.692
It was a stupid idea.
Forgive me.

16:32.727 --> 16:34.558
It was stupid.

16:34.593 --> 16:37.479
No, not ignorance.
I was being stupid.

16:40.401 --> 16:44.369
Do not worry !, I'll explain
all once we get to Chicago.

17:12.164 --> 17:12.964
- Is there anything that does not make it convenient?
- Molly!

17:13.000 --> 17:19.271
- I just told you so
- Molly, all will be fine!

17:21.707 --> 17:26.746
- What is so funny?
- When imagining we're engaged.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.484
Wish you happiness!

17:32.519 --> 17:34.251
Mother, why not tell?

17:34.286 --> 17:37.449
Dad, who want to do it
to tell the world that you're engaged

17:40.760 --> 17:45.687
- Oh, my sweet girl!
- We are very happy for you both!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.934
And you look thinner!

17:48.969 --> 17:49.967
Mrs !

17:50.002 --> 17:52.002
This is the best wedding gift for your mother!

17:52.037 --> 17:56.235
No wonder you did not tell us
about the mysterious man.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.043
- Alas, where the ring fiance?
- Good. That is all!

18:00.713 --> 18:02.408
I have to talk to you now.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.971
- Do you realize that this is a women's restroom?
- Hi, how are you?

18:09.006 --> 18:11.590
What are you doing?
Father Shanahan out there!

18:11.625 --> 18:13.859
- What do you want me to do?
- I do not know!

18:13.894 --> 18:15.486
I will not marry you!

18:16.095 --> 18:17.828
Marriage? Who says it
in marriage?

18:17.863 --> 18:20.514
Come back to Los Angeles in less than a week.

18:20.549 --> 18:23.165
So you want me to pretend
bertungan few days?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.469
Does it demand
that too much?

18:25.504 --> 18:27.505
Okay. Maybe it was too much.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.941
I'm not asking you, or
for me, but for my father.

18:31.976 --> 18:36.343
Think of all the good that will come
if you're dying but feel happy.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.688
Why do you think she's pregnant?

18:42.723 --> 18:43.921
Because I know Josh, right?

18:43.956 --> 18:47.289
And the only way he will get married
if forced.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.185
What?

18:50.396 --> 18:53.456
I mean ... How did you do it?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.499
He was not her!

18:55.534 --> 18:58.504
No, look.
People can change.

18:58.539 --> 19:00.938
Maybe he is tired...

19:00.973 --> 19:04.844
dating with women
with beautiful breasts.

19:04.879 --> 19:06.879
God, she was pregnant.

19:06.914 --> 19:08.145
Bastard!

19:08.180 --> 19:12.585
Before you kill him,
who knows there are other possibilities.

19:12.620 --> 19:14.820
- like what?
- They're in love?

19:14.855 --> 19:16.153
You know them.

19:16.188 --> 19:18.088
Is it always involves one another.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.054
It was the beginning!

19:20.392 --> 19:23.095
If you think so,
why did not he call me?

19:23.130 --> 19:24.495
Why did not he call me?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.600
I do not know. Maybe they feel
that you did not approve.

19:27.635 --> 19:29.869
and not really jumping for joy.

19:29.904 --> 19:31.496
Can you blame me?

19:32.438 --> 19:33.530
- Honey?
- What?

19:33.906 --> 19:35.237
Bears.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.779
Why did not you call?

19:42.381 --> 19:45.009
If he wants to talk to me,
He should call me.

20:05.971 --> 20:06.960
Carla!

20:07.573 --> 20:09.837
I know, I know, I know.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.445
Where is Sean?
I have to talk to him.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.681
Want to tell anyone younger girlfriend?

20:15.716 --> 20:16.847
He already knows.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.816
I can explain everything.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.920
But not now.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.461
Josh, listen up!

20:30.496 --> 20:34.523
Cousin Phii must accompany
Molly down the aisle tomorrow.

20:34.833 --> 20:37.597
But because of what happened,
I thought you ...

20:38.070 --> 20:40.834
- Yes that's good.
- Good.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.339
Welcome to the family!

20:43.309 --> 20:46.301
- What is that?
- How do you raise the children?

20:47.112 --> 20:48.272
How can it be?

20:48.981 --> 20:51.142
Josh created a Jewish home.

20:52.284 --> 20:55.420
Uncle Primo,
too early to talk about the children, is not it?

20:55.455 --> 20:58.557
Actually, Josh and I were talking about
baby names ...

20:58.592 --> 20:59.992
- On the way here.
- What?

21:00.027 --> 21:01.926
What do you think
the name "Lucas"?

21:03.028 --> 21:05.464
Can I talk to you, dear?

21:05.499 --> 21:06.692
Of course baby.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.538
- What are you doing?
- I am just kidding.

21:12.573 --> 21:14.371
Well, but do it in other places.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.009
Say that will be given to children
we were named one of the ten apostles ...

21:17.044 --> 21:20.342
- Twelve genius.
- Anything. It did not help.

21:21.747 --> 21:26.480
Actually, I do not think
about who will celebrate.

21:28.153 --> 21:33.425
Father Shanahan will do the honors
tomorrow night for me and Doreen.

21:33.460 --> 21:36.519
I'm sure it will be incredible.

21:38.097 --> 21:41.834
you do not worry about the fact
that Molly a Catholic, right?

21:41.869 --> 21:44.136
No! Of course not.

21:44.171 --> 21:45.330
Do not be silly.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.442
and you're not concerned with
Josh who is a Jew, right?

21:50.477 --> 21:53.036
Of course not.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.713
Of course not.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.851
What is important is that they are in love.

21:58.886 --> 22:00.318
Exactly.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.254
I know this may be difficult for you,

22:02.289 --> 22:04.054
but place the yourself in my shoes.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.241
I came here for my mother's wedding ...

22:06.276 --> 22:08.569
- Not to eat ruglox ...
- Rugelax.

22:08.604 --> 22:10.862
Anything! With all the tribes of Israel!

22:11.630 --> 22:13.297
Wow, .. Is there a problem with my people?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.767
Because the nation is a party.
"I'm Irish. I'll dance for you ..

22:16.802 --> 22:19.003
Where the whiskey?
I love Lucky Charms.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.673
I want a pot of gold.
Where is my golden pot "

22:21.708 --> 22:23.442
- No, you're making this hard!
- Not me, you!

22:23.477 --> 22:24.773
- You're childish!
-You are childish.

22:32.718 --> 22:35.470
Okay I think it's time

22:35.505 --> 22:38.048
.! .. Mom, Dad, thank you.
Thank you

22:38.083 --> 22:40.833
You want to go?
We still have dessert.

22:40.868 --> 22:43.584
Yes I know
But we are tired

22:44.296 --> 22:46.764
Okay, rest!

22:47.099 --> 22:48.760
The rooms in the guest room ready

22:50.602 --> 22:53.205
Actually, we were thinking of going to the hotel.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.738
Hotel?

22:54.773 --> 22:57.142
- We have a lot of room
- Abide with us!

22:57.177 --> 22:59.235
I have a key for Ramada

23:00.612 --> 23:02.045
just an idea!

23:02.648 --> 23:05.231
If privacy is what you want ...

23:05.266 --> 23:07.815
Could be in the apartment was in store.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.720
Is it as your stock?

23:09.755 --> 23:11.455
Just as inventory. So what?

23:11.490 --> 23:14.526
The apartments provide everything you need
and only five minutes from here.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.118
It was close to where we were?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.620
With the right price.

23:41.053 --> 23:44.452
- Call me.
- Here they are. Can join.

23:44.487 --> 23:47.852
Thank you, dear.
That suitcase, is not it?

23:48.460 --> 23:52.191
if the desire of coffee in the kitchen sink
on the right.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.801
Okay. If you need anything, just call.

23:55.836 --> 23:57.462
- Thanks, guys.
- Bye.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.968
- See you later!
- Correct. Good.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.470
Okay.

24:08.881 --> 24:12.009
My God, they like
Orcs of Middle Eastern Jews.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.550
You like Sauron ...

24:13.585 --> 24:16.645
and I like being down in the bowels of Mordor.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.520
Do not know if ...

24:19.391 --> 24:21.191
Not OK.

24:21.226 --> 24:23.061
I think I can lift
The two suitcases.

24:23.096 --> 24:24.790
Does not matter.

24:30.836 --> 24:32.098
This is where we are.

24:35.040 --> 24:38.610
- Not too bad, right?
- Of course, it is wonderful here.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.712
This is much better than I remembered.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.780
This frame is really cool.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.646
The bathrooms here ...

24:52.324 --> 24:56.226
if you need to use it.

24:58.096 --> 25:01.896
Everything else I think is quite clear.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.470
Why do not you take the bed?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.873
No no no.
you get a bed.

25:07.908 --> 25:09.206
I do not mind sleeping on the couch.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.909
you get a bed,
and I, with a sofa.

25:10.944 --> 25:12.877
Okay.
I'm going to sleep.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.648
Oh cool. What is a park Wrigley?

25:16.683 --> 25:18.275
Oh yes.

25:24.389 --> 25:28.883
Moll, sorry if
I'm a little angry this morning.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.827
A little upset?

25:30.862 --> 25:35.094
I do not forward- thinking,
will be very nasty to you.

25:37.269 --> 25:39.066
I'm sorry too.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.628
I mean ...

25:43.075 --> 25:46.545
This trip was not exactly as planned,
Do you know.

25:46.580 --> 25:50.148
Sure, but you're doing well.

25:50.183 --> 25:51.376
Incredible, yes.

25:52.117 --> 25:56.918
If one day I got engaged.
In fact, I know how to act. Is not it?

25:58.624 --> 26:00.615
You made my father very happy.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.086
Thank you.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.099
Stop or you'll make me cry.

26:07.134 --> 26:08.623
Come here.
Here.

26:11.436 --> 26:12.767
Look.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.371
we will be a family.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.345
I do not like to hug.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.148
I do not either.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.376
I will...

26:30.088 --> 26:32.824
I'll meet Sean jogging
and explain everything. Want to come along?

26:32.859 --> 26:36.059
jogging? No no.
I'm not an athlete.

26:36.094 --> 26:41.122
I'm the type of girl who prefers
lying on the beach and out without jogging.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.062
Come on, I'm going slowly.
Very slow.

26:53.545 --> 26:54.671
Urlacher!

26:59.184 --> 27:01.049
At least someone's happy to see me.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.421
You expect me to give a speech

27:04.456 --> 27:06.321
after you knocked up my sister?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.993
I do not impregnate your sister.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.686
That's not what you think,
I swear.

27:13.832 --> 27:16.130
Want to hear what I say
or ...?

27:18.337 --> 27:19.895
Yes, I think so.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.837
Where Molly?

27:26.578 --> 27:27.806
Right behind me.

27:37.589 --> 27:40.683
- It's crazy, is not it?
- Upset?

27:43.195 --> 27:45.464
I actually
with a bit of a shocker ...

27:45.499 --> 27:47.500
- To think of you with my sister.
- Certain.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.501
But once I think something sinister.

27:49.536 --> 27:51.134
scary thought my brain ...

27:51.169 --> 27:53.305
I start to see that you're finally together.

27:53.340 --> 27:54.271
Is it true?

27:54.306 --> 27:57.209
He's a little silly, but remember
girl you're dating ...

27:57.244 --> 28:00.143
-'ve Done much worse.
- I can not disagree.

28:00.178 --> 28:04.416
I also agree with you as brothers.

28:04.451 --> 28:05.883
That is fun!

28:06.184 --> 28:08.019
Although you earned playing ball.

28:08.054 --> 28:11.318
O Lord, correct.
Water.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.991
Yes, I need some water.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.162
My God, what happened?

28:19.931 --> 28:23.833
.. He made me jogging.

28:31.243 --> 28:34.178
You like Molly Teresa.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.114
you will do the same.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.082
I do not know, maybe.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.176
Probably not.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.289
If he's smart,
he would ask properly.

28:44.324 --> 28:47.156
I will refuse.
He's not my type.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.193
Yes, now you can be in a band.

28:55.100 --> 28:58.670
Please do not let him wake up. Help
,

28:58.705 --> 29:00.570
Please do not let him wake up.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.438
Mother, Mother, Mother.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.610
Hi honey.

29:06.645 --> 29:09.014
Hi honey.
My baby.

29:09.049 --> 29:10.811
- Mrs.
- Hi

29:11.917 --> 29:14.953
Do you want to see Aunt Molly?

29:14.988 --> 29:17.649
Not Aunt Molly.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.091
Look at the cat.

29:21.993 --> 29:22.959
Do not want a cat?

29:22.994 --> 29:26.088
Can you mengendongnya?
Take as I say.

29:26.364 --> 29:27.626
Here, dear.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.336
He did not want to stay with me.
Dont know what to do.

29:31.371 --> 29:33.839
Do not hold strong.

29:33.874 --> 29:35.602
I am trying.

29:39.578 --> 29:40.811
God.

29:40.846 --> 29:43.041
- He is very funny.
- I know.

29:47.352 --> 29:48.876
cute baby.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.455
- Mrs.
- What is your mother?

29:52.924 --> 29:54.152
- Want?
- Okay.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.728
- Come to Mother.
- Go.

29:56.763 --> 29:58.491
Hi, dear.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.837
- Hello.
- Honey.

30:40.872 --> 30:42.405
I just wanted to make sure ...

30:42.440 --> 30:44.032
people who can not sleep and
miss the wedding.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.137
I think I fainted
last night.

30:49.347 --> 30:50.413
By the way, where are you?

30:50.448 --> 30:52.177
I'm getting ready in my parents' house.

30:53.518 --> 30:56.152
- So we do not go together?
- No

30:56.187 --> 30:58.587
My mother wanted me to come early
to help.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.385
Also, you have to be quick just to take pictures.

31:02.627 --> 31:03.627
What?

31:03.662 --> 31:05.254
Wait a minute.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.353
God, how many years this milk?

31:12.388 --> 31:14.539
God, no!
Do not drink anything from the fridge.

31:14.574 --> 31:16.268
Everything in it was
billion years ago.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.012
Art, broken zipper.
Can you help?

31:25.183 --> 31:26.216
Silence.
I think I succeeded.

31:26.251 --> 31:29.087
- You tickle me.
- Forgive me.

31:29.122 --> 31:32.874
When looking at the dress worn at the opening
A more practical than closing.

31:32.909 --> 31:35.560
Owwh ,. Why do you think to marry?

31:39.998 --> 31:41.966
Oh no!

31:45.305 --> 31:47.504
- Be serious!
- I think you're right!

31:47.539 --> 31:49.564
Maybe we could save for a honeymoon.

31:52.377 --> 31:56.108
There are many advantages to getting married, right?

31:56.314 --> 31:58.415
No, I think the opposite!

31:58.450 --> 32:00.552
It is true!

32:05.423 --> 32:06.754
Mrs!

32:08.627 --> 32:09.651
It was Molly?

32:10.996 --> 32:12.190
Mrs!

32:14.966 --> 32:18.798

32:19.804 --> 32:24.476

32:24.511 --> 32:26.910

32:38.224 --> 32:39.884
Yes, and I feel good.

32:41.660 --> 32:42.957
Do not you think ...

32:45.497 --> 32:46.930
Pregnant, Nausea?

32:48.733 --> 32:49.961

32:52.404 --> 32:53.701

32:55.540 --> 32:56.768
Moll?

33:15.393 --> 33:16.793

33:16.828 --> 33:20.662
Yes, father. Molly was getting ready
at her parents' house.

33:22.067 --> 33:25.236
Good.
I really want to talk to you alone.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.533
Yes, what is it?

33:27.038 --> 33:28.838
About what happened at the airport.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.638
No, Dad.
Do not worry about it.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.244
you were asked to keep a secret ...

33:33.279 --> 33:34.944
and must be respected.

33:34.979 --> 33:38.550
Your mother and I have good news lately ...

33:38.585 --> 33:41.417
so when we heard about you and Molly ..

33:42.554 --> 33:44.354
we became a little excited.

33:44.389 --> 33:46.856
Okay. It all worked.
It is okay.

33:46.891 --> 33:49.894
However, we must mengkompensasimu

33:49.929 --> 33:53.264
Dad did not. you do not need
give me anything.

33:53.299 --> 33:55.630
This is not mine. But your grandmother.

33:59.904 --> 34:01.064
this is beautiful.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.909
But I can not give it to Molly.

34:08.246 --> 34:11.483
Why not?
do you think he does not like it?

34:11.518 --> 34:13.007
No no.

34:16.321 --> 34:18.050
I think he would like it.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.155
Forward tarianmu.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.536
I'm sorry mother.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.210

Mother did not slack.

34:44.649 --> 34:46.310
You'll find out soon.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.813
How can it be?

34:49.286 --> 34:51.788
It was ridiculous. She was not pregnant.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.824
That explains why we never know you are dating.

34:54.859 --> 34:57.595
You can stop, Shannon.
You throw up all the time and are not pregnant.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.614
I said I was lactose intolerant!

34:59.649 --> 35:01.599
you're more tolerant
size 42.

35:01.634 --> 35:02.759

I'm just saying that if he really loves ...

35:05.872 --> 35:09.000

35:15.947 --> 35:17.710
How's my favorite fiance?

35:18.516 --> 35:20.518
What?
What is wrong?

35:20.553 --> 35:22.285
Nothing, except ...

35:22.320 --> 35:24.982
I think that mothers
is pregnant.

35:25.523 --> 35:26.623
What?

35:26.658 --> 35:29.058
He thinks the only reason
people like you ...

35:29.093 --> 35:31.618
married to someone like me
if I was pregnant.

35:32.564 --> 35:35.362
Such a thing does not change
distance where three miles away.

35:35.900 --> 35:38.596
- So you're telling the truth?
- No, I lied.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.770
I told you to do
judging from the appearance,

35:42.473 --> 35:45.610
and we decided to get married
because our relationship ...

35:45.645 --> 35:47.737
deep and sentimental.

35:49.013 --> 35:52.244
Well, this might fit with your toe.

35:53.051 --> 35:54.886
- What is that?
- This diamond ring from my grandmother.

35:54.921 --> 35:56.154
- No
- Take

35:56.189 --> 35:57.353
Forget !. No

35:57.388 --> 35:59.822
- What? try!
- No

36:00.024 --> 36:02.143
I'm not going to use
Cinicin grandmother who had died.

36:02.178 --> 36:04.905
- Molly, are you trying to ...
- You're not healthy.

36:04.940 --> 36:07.632
Molly, if you tried to convince your mother.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.232
and all the others involved ...

36:09.267 --> 36:11.402
First of all, a diamond engagement ring
is a good way to start.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.563
Okay, but it is not sold at Walmart!

36:15.073 --> 36:19.242
I think your grandmother
do not want to see me ...

36:19.277 --> 36:23.615
using a 1.75-carat ring ...

36:23.650 --> 36:26.243
decorated with diamonds of a princess.

36:28.753 --> 36:31.654
Stop worrying
about my grandmother!

36:31.689 --> 36:34.180
He spent his life
trying to make her happy ...

36:34.592 --> 36:36.890
and will not make her happy ...

36:37.228 --> 36:39.696
If you see you're wearing
diamond ring for a few days.

36:40.498 --> 36:44.264
Okay. May also finger
does not match this.

36:44.602 --> 36:45.602
What?

36:45.637 --> 36:48.037
I would not wear myself.
you are going to do it.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.900
Is it true?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.510
Okay. Drugs.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.746
He even has a diamond!

36:56.781 --> 36:59.750
you create a drama,
Where is he?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.090
Are you okay?

37:07.125 --> 37:09.616
He gave a diamond ring
for her now!

37:15.300 --> 37:16.733
I think that's my job.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.539
And he did it with his knees.

37:22.707 --> 37:25.267
On the day of her wedding.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.237
It was very romantic.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.383
What is wrong?
Unlike a diamond ring?

37:32.418 --> 37:33.873
I like it.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.415
So what happened?

37:39.691 --> 37:45.196
I do not know.
Yesterday, I found out that my boyfriend ...

37:45.231 --> 37:47.721
betrayed me with his wife.

37:50.335 --> 37:51.495
And now...

37:53.037 --> 37:55.204
wait a lifetime for a man ...

37:55.239 --> 37:58.800
love me enough to propose to marry
with a diamond ring grandmother.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.642
I had a ring packing. It is just...

38:04.015 --> 38:06.449
I do not know what
was I thinking, understand?

38:08.353 --> 38:10.583
Come here.
Come here.

38:11.556 --> 38:12.750

38:31.843 --> 38:34.073
Yes OK!

38:38.282 --> 38:39.442

38:41.252 --> 38:43.619

38:43.654 --> 38:48.393
Nice to meet you.
God, you are fantastic!

38:48.428 --> 38:50.461
How can you use this sesecantik dress
at a wedding?

38:50.496 --> 38:52.264
you're going to steal the people
than the bride.

38:52.299 --> 38:54.263
Joshua Shiffman always tempting.

38:54.298 --> 38:56.227

I'm ok thanks.

39:01.174 --> 39:02.438
Will not drink?

39:02.473 --> 39:04.142
I think marriage
makes you nervous.

39:04.177 --> 39:06.508
That's it.
They scare me, but ...

39:06.911 --> 39:09.880
for me, it's a little early
to start drinking champagne.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.474
Where is Mitch?

39:13.684 --> 39:16.084
Oh, I guess you've never heard of.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.188
We broke up a few months ago.

39:19.424 --> 39:20.413
Is it true?

39:22.293 --> 39:23.694
Anybody see my mother
out there?

39:23.729 --> 39:24.694

39:33.838 --> 39:35.606
I'm very happy for you.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.873
I had to find my mother.

39:37.908 --> 39:40.105
You look incredible.
you are right.

39:40.578 --> 39:42.068
- Was it something I said?
- I do not know.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.273
God.

39:47.952 --> 39:49.952
I mean, Mitch is one of those good

39:49.987 --> 39:53.458
but if we marry before
I enjoy life a little ...

39:53.493 --> 39:54.686
I'll be sorry.

39:55.526 --> 39:56.754
Of course.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.962
So, now I'm just enjoying my time alone,
keeping options open ...

40:00.331 --> 40:03.357
coming to a family wedding
to see an old friend.

40:04.635 --> 40:09.538
And you?
What are you going on a date with someone special?

40:10.942 --> 40:12.577
- It's complicated.
- Josh!

40:12.612 --> 40:13.908
Geez!

40:14.679 --> 40:17.131
Congratulations, my friend.
I just know.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.549

- Not exactly.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.220
This guy just got engaged to my niece balls.
What do you think?

40:22.255 --> 40:23.983
You're engaged?

40:24.222 --> 40:25.823
- Look ...

40:25.858 --> 40:27.390
- Come on.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.417
Marriage start, come on!

40:30.928 --> 40:33.055
- I want to talk to you ...
- Congratulations.

40:47.378 --> 40:48.511
I guess I can not do that.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.140
What? Why not?
We're next.

40:51.415 --> 40:53.851
No, I'm talking about our engagement.

40:53.886 --> 40:54.917
Why?

40:54.952 --> 40:58.421
- Because I panicked, okay?
- Correct. Relax.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.958
Angie and Iris discuss
on our honeymoon.

41:00.993 --> 41:02.592
I do not like lying to my friends ...

41:02.627 --> 41:04.595
and no matter what I say,
all think I'm pregnant!

41:04.630 --> 41:06.927
- Okay.
- Molly and Josh, your turn.

41:10.668 --> 41:11.726
Oh, my God!

41:12.503 --> 41:14.198
you can trust me,
okay?

41:16.607 --> 41:17.904
Okay. Here we go.

41:55.613 --> 41:57.715
I just thought that first night ...

41:57.750 --> 41:59.782
such as checking to the dentist.

41:59.817 --> 42:03.654
Have less pain and a few screams,
but next visit ...

42:03.689 --> 42:05.388
much easier.

42:05.423 --> 42:08.358
As if she did not go to the dentist before.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.563
And always remember to say
he did a good job.

42:12.598 --> 42:15.633
Men need a lot of encouragement.

42:15.668 --> 42:18.669
Actually, I found a website that says.

42:18.704 --> 42:19.795
Waiter!

42:20.638 --> 42:24.404
Should you drink, dear,
with hamilmu condition?

42:25.076 --> 42:26.375
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

42:26.410 --> 42:28.479
Do you mind if
I steal from your fiance?

42:28.514 --> 42:29.639
Sorry.

42:31.015 --> 42:32.798
Dear God, thank you!

42:32.833 --> 42:34.582

42:35.720 --> 42:39.490

44:48.119 --> 44:51.620
After seeing many brides become friends ...

44:51.655 --> 44:55.493

45:57.122 --> 45:58.988

45:59.023 --> 46:01.150
- Sean, you're not going to come.
- Yeah yeah.

47:05.122 --> 47:08.523
I want you to understand that
you can not support this legislation.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.460
It's not like hitting people.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.259
This is really satisfying,

47:15.666 --> 47:16.758
I have to go.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.247
Josh.

48:12.356 --> 48:14.189
What?
Is everything okay?

48:14.224 --> 48:17.159
Okay. Do not wake Molly.
Come talk to me.

48:42.553 --> 48:45.022
- You are okay? It's about the father?
- No, he's fine.

48:45.057 --> 48:47.623
Only marriage makes tired ...

48:47.658 --> 48:50.684
and the doctor said he should
stay home and rest.

48:51.128 --> 48:53.413
So we're fine.

48:53.448 --> 48:55.699
Yes, I can help in the shop.

48:55.734 --> 48:57.199
you're a good boy, Joshua.

48:57.234 --> 48:59.703
I would shower and breakfast.

48:59.738 --> 49:02.172
- Give me a few minutes.
- While you shower, I get you a breakfast for you!

49:02.207 --> 49:03.400
What are favored by Molly?

49:14.318 --> 49:17.014

49:18.889 --> 49:21.187

49:22.593 --> 49:26.463

49:30.200 --> 49:32.368

49:36.140 --> 49:38.768

49:39.410 --> 49:41.537
Good morning!

49:41.912 --> 49:43.512

49:53.343 --> 49:55.017
How does the size of the diamonds?

49:55.359 --> 49:58.128
It was a 1.75 carat princess cut!

49:58.163 --> 49:59.959
Oh, my God!

50:00.531 --> 50:03.261
- Suzanne, I really have to go.
- Wait, Molly.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.397
Is the engagement ring of
grandmother?

50:06.904 --> 50:09.099
Yeah, yeah, but ...

50:09.873 --> 50:12.609
- Really sweet.
- It's like a fairy tale.

50:12.644 --> 50:13.676
It is beautiful.

50:13.711 --> 50:15.406
Okay. I'll call you later.

50:15.612 --> 50:16.636
- Hello?
- Molly?

50:17.147 --> 50:18.247

50:18.282 --> 50:19.681
Not, at least we will be bridesmaids.

50:20.551 --> 50:22.644
Chair.
I brought breakfast.

50:23.454 --> 50:26.287
- Bacon and eggs?
- Josh said you like.

50:26.523 --> 50:30.359
He said that?
Do you know where he is?

50:30.394 --> 50:32.961
- I need to talk to him.
- Now it can not.

50:32.996 --> 50:35.529
He came down with the collector.

50:37.034 --> 50:41.004
And here we have a classic scenes
the television series "LOST."

50:41.039 --> 50:43.505
And here we are a young man waiting to receive ...

50:43.540 --> 50:46.443
the company of some beautiful women of
"Mad Men."

50:46.478 --> 50:48.104
Danger, curves ahead.

50:49.780 --> 50:53.083
The idea is to adapt them to
resembles a television?

50:53.118 --> 50:55.916
- Right!
- And how many are we talking about?

50:56.320 --> 50:59.573
75 is based on the TV, in the movies ... 112

50:59.608 --> 51:02.826
133 more in the great American literature ...

51:02.861 --> 51:05.386
and two larger diorama.

51:05.929 --> 51:08.031
My mother and I made a diorama like this ...

51:08.066 --> 51:10.367
since I was little.

51:10.402 --> 51:12.668
We can not have a TV at home.

51:13.604 --> 51:15.071
Is it true?

51:15.606 --> 51:16.595
Yes.

51:18.542 --> 51:20.075
So he has ...

51:20.110 --> 51:24.014
good and bad days, but yesterday was one of the best
day ...

51:24.049 --> 51:26.683
her in a long time.

51:26.718 --> 51:28.742
And we owe it to you.

51:29.453 --> 51:32.047
I just want you to know...

51:32.823 --> 51:35.917
You are making men
I love most ...

51:36.260 --> 51:38.091
very happy.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.129
Mrs Shiffman.

51:43.767 --> 51:48.970
- Mrs
- I want to tell you something.

51:49.807 --> 51:53.299
I come.
Traffic is bad.

51:53.911 --> 51:55.640
What are you doing here?

51:56.280 --> 51:58.077
You forgot, did not you?

52:00.417 --> 52:01.617
Clothing.

52:01.652 --> 52:04.855
Moll, I promise to return the dress and tuxedo
this afternoon...

52:04.890 --> 52:07.824
- Or gets surcharge, dear.
- And then we'll have lunch.

52:10.227 --> 52:11.360
Meat and eggs?

52:11.395 --> 52:14.193
Yes, that's what I ate.

52:17.634 --> 52:20.125
For the last time,
I'm not pregnant!

52:28.612 --> 52:30.647
Hi, welcome to the White
Chicago.

52:30.682 --> 52:32.648
- I want it back.
- Good!

52:32.683 --> 52:34.742
Why do you get so many phone calls?

52:35.052 --> 52:37.782
Does that everyone is very excited
with marriage.

52:38.155 --> 52:41.283
Phone tones it truly captivating.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.592
My daughter got engaged.

52:45.128 --> 52:46.395
Is it true?

52:46.430 --> 52:49.867
Beatrice, you can check the item
Mahoney's mother, please.

52:49.902 --> 52:53.428
Certain. But it will take a little time.

52:53.904 --> 52:55.571
What if a few minutes ...

52:55.606 --> 52:58.108
why do not we see how you
on the wedding day later?

52:58.143 --> 52:59.473
This.

53:00.043 --> 53:03.345
Really do not want to do that.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.083
He would be perfect for the new Vera Wang gown.

53:06.118 --> 53:07.812
- The one with the white line?
- Yes

53:08.819 --> 53:10.954
But we only sell it to one of the girls in
Kennedy.

53:10.989 --> 53:12.955
- Honey.
- Wait a minute.

53:12.990 --> 53:17.160
I think I will go back there
and see which suit your size.

53:17.195 --> 53:19.663
- What is strange?
- No no.

53:19.698 --> 53:21.632
- Come on.
- Thank you.

53:21.667 --> 53:23.567
- I have to go.
- It will be fun.

53:23.602 --> 53:25.501
It's a good deal, but ...

53:26.703 --> 53:28.330
You smell good.

53:31.141 --> 53:32.374
Framery.

53:32.409 --> 53:34.645
Freida, how are you?

53:34.680 --> 53:36.445
Okay.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.716
He was on the top floor is now showing some frames
for Mr. Bernardi.

53:39.751 --> 53:41.013
That's my son.

53:41.451 --> 53:44.420
Rest.
I'll see you at home.

53:44.888 --> 53:45.946
Okay.

53:46.823 --> 53:49.592
I sell Belle Air Deluxe
with copper patina ...

53:49.627 --> 53:52.362
and win bonuses
if we sell to 26.

53:52.397 --> 53:54.698
- It was fantastic.
- I'll tell Woody.

53:54.733 --> 53:56.666
Woody will be waiting.
Sat.

54:00.304 --> 54:01.328
What happened?

54:01.605 --> 54:04.733
This is a smart move
suggest clause bonus.

54:05.175 --> 54:07.008
There's something your father would have done.

54:07.043 --> 54:08.842
I was trained by the best.

54:10.013 --> 54:13.244
But "the best" are not doing their best.

54:15.085 --> 54:18.486
What do you think if you and Molly
stay here longer?

54:39.142 --> 54:41.244
I like the ring of diamonds.
Princess Cut?

54:41.279 --> 54:43.347
Do you mind if we take a picture?

54:43.382 --> 54:44.712
Why not take two?

54:45.015 --> 54:46.209
Smile!

54:48.151 --> 54:52.713
Such as six dollars, is absolutely ridiculous.

54:54.791 --> 54:59.229
There is a dress that I really like.

54:59.264 --> 55:03.332
It was a long strapless,

55:03.367 --> 55:06.962
with lace and has a beautiful tail ...

55:07.604 --> 55:11.199
Oh God, why am I talking about it?

55:13.510 --> 55:15.159
How was your day?

55:15.194 --> 55:16.808
Good. I mean ...

55:17.547 --> 55:19.674
a little bit sick this morning ...

55:20.650 --> 55:22.919
but perhaps because of tequila.

55:22.954 --> 55:25.012
- This is.
- But, you know ...

55:26.256 --> 55:27.917
all of them, are very good.

55:32.763 --> 55:36.563
Something ...

55:39.836 --> 55:41.929
Did something happen last night?

55:42.406 --> 55:44.840
- Are you serious?
- Yes

55:48.779 --> 55:52.044
Josh, you rocked my world.

55:55.285 --> 55:56.513
surprised?

55:56.853 --> 55:58.718
You were magnificent.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.221
I?

56:07.998 --> 56:09.124
Oh, God.

56:11.802 --> 56:14.738
We woke up with only underwear
and embrace each other.

56:14.773 --> 56:17.639
What should I think?
You idiot.

56:18.542 --> 56:19.531
Geez!

56:20.210 --> 56:22.112
Nothing happens.
Trust me.

56:22.147 --> 56:23.739
Thank you, God!

56:24.481 --> 56:28.652
Would not be good if it happened ..

56:28.687 --> 56:32.823
I'm just saying it does not have a reason ...

56:32.858 --> 56:34.787
to let all the more bizarre.

56:34.822 --> 56:36.716
This sort of thing would be even more unusual.

56:43.700 --> 56:47.761
Actually, I talked to my mom today,
and he...

56:48.438 --> 56:51.339
He asked if we
could have stayed longer.

56:51.741 --> 56:53.538
Until the end of the week?

56:56.513 --> 56:59.073
I think he thinks more ...

57:00.617 --> 57:03.347
in one month or more.

57:10.494 --> 57:12.962
So what you say?

57:17.701 --> 57:20.869
This is ridiculous.
I'll tell him ...

57:20.904 --> 57:24.975
you have to go back
work or to school ...

57:25.010 --> 57:29.173
or whatever.
Forgive me. It was ridiculous.

57:31.915 --> 57:35.078
No no.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.844
Say you're going to stay.

57:39.723 --> 57:40.985
Is it true?

57:46.496 --> 57:47.690
Thank you.

57:59.142 --> 58:01.042
- God.
- What?

58:18.295 --> 58:19.887
you're so disgusting today.

58:48.658 --> 58:50.250
- Is that?
- Yes

58:50.760 --> 58:52.625
Now, come here.

58:54.798 --> 58:57.200
- And feel the mahogany frame.
- God.

58:57.235 --> 58:59.464
- Is very soft.
- Oh, my God.

58:59.769 --> 59:01.503
- Josh, row three.
- Is very soft.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.640
Would you excuse us, lady?

59:03.675 --> 59:06.404
- Okay.
- We'll be fine here.

59:11.314 --> 59:13.009
It Josh.
How can I help you?

59:13.450 --> 59:16.851
I can think of several ways,
but I'm at work.

59:17.187 --> 59:18.687
I'll call you.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.924
Do not tell
longer need a divorce lawyer?

59:20.959 --> 59:22.424
Not yet.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.728
Hardly had the opportunity to
talking on Marriage.

59:24.763 --> 59:27.097
Want to go out to eat something ...

59:27.132 --> 59:28.724
or a drink later?

59:29.199 --> 59:30.767
Do not know if it's a good idea.

59:30.802 --> 59:32.033
how about lunch?

59:32.068 --> 59:34.069
Lunch is a great idea.

59:34.104 --> 59:36.800
This is the perfect food and
between breakfast and dinner.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.035
- Josh.
- Come on.

59:39.943 --> 59:41.945
I can not face all these husbands traitors ...

59:41.980 --> 59:43.469
on an empty stomach, are you willing?

59:45.115 --> 59:46.082
Okay.

59:49.519 --> 59:52.852
It is a good idea.

59:53.490 --> 59:56.059
We must pass
at least one day at the spa ...

59:56.094 --> 59:57.549
before you go.

59:58.395 --> 01:00:00.761
Actually, I'm not going to go away tomorrow.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.282
So, he finally left the company ...

01:00:19.317 --> 01:00:20.909
and was promoted to partner.

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.881
You look like a cat that always lands on his feet.

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.882
Looks like you're doing well.

01:00:30.193 --> 01:00:31.956
And is now engaged.

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:34.523
Yes!

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.234
The fact there is another story.

01:00:38.269 --> 01:00:41.260
Is it true?
I want to hear it.

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:46.042
Okay. Why do you think I'm going to stay?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:51.281
Because I think that you like
pretend to be her fiancé Josh.

01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:52.881
It's really fun.

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.783
And I think he fell in love with you.

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:00.890
So you're not really dating?

01:01:00.925 --> 01:01:02.414
No, I do not.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:07.622
Actually, I'm very free and single
like you.

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:12.501
I'm feeling like brother and sister.

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:18.336
You're in denial so deep.
it is very sad.

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:21.174
Carla Mahoney five minutes.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:23.777
Five minutes for what?

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:27.676
I would want to be given a special wax.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:31.979
you will be given a special wax?

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.257
So, what are your plans for this evening?

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.960
looking better every minute.

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.858
In the form of heart?

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.734
People like that?

01:01:45.769 --> 01:01:49.038
unfortunately, people like
changes there.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:50.205
Want to do well?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.543
No! and Josh will be back soon

01:01:53.578 --> 01:01:55.135
With whom he had lunch?

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.040
With friend.

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.413
- Let's get out of here.

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:06.847
What? It's just a lunch. I
trust him.

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:09.157
Do you trust him?

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:13.185
Did you hear what you're saying?
Both singles!

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.232
It is time.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.744
You know what?
Forget it.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:33.875
Do not know what I'm talking about.
They will catch up.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:54.196
Do not disturb!

01:03:02.679 --> 01:03:07.048
Do not disturb!

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:14.022
No more sex.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.124
I need to eat!

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:21.624
It does not stand up.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.699
drinkers as a skunk.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:27.430
Why not shut up, Fred?
Silence. Dong?

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.711
What's got into you?

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:43.185
Have never seen anything that rocked
previous heart.

01:03:45.755 --> 01:03:47.382
Want to see more?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.760
Shit.
I must go home.

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:16.717
It's almost like a really real!

01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:34.153
Molly.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.026
Molly.

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:39.862
Molly, you come home?

01:05:42.005 --> 01:05:42.994
God!

01:05:43.172 --> 01:05:44.540
God!

01:05:44.575 --> 01:05:45.873
Wow ...

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:48.001
Okay.
I was in the bathtub.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:51.580
- Did you come here to bathe.
- .. Yes

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.083
seems incredible.
It seems relaxed.

01:05:54.118 --> 01:05:57.814
what a very large bathtub. No

01:05:59.188 --> 01:06:00.120
What?

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.960
How do lunch with Giselle?

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:09.257
That's great, you know ...

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.500
- It took a while.
- Yes I know.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.764
Sorry I did not call.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:20.143
Josh, we do not really
significantly engaged.

01:06:20.178 --> 01:06:21.576
You do not have to call.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:25.069
Do what you want,
with anyone. That's not a problem.

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:28.348
Sorry. Certain.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:33.552
Actually, it's good to hear
you say that because ...

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.150
we like living together.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:44.767
You mean together, together?

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:50.522
crazy,
but do not worry.

01:06:50.557 --> 01:06:53.541
I'm sworn to secrecy.
It is okay.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.978
are you okay if Giselle
and I stick together, right?

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.277
Yep!

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:14.092
Is .. You .. already ..
finished taking a bath?

01:07:20.002 --> 01:07:23.062
really bad ...

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:35.359
Good. in engineering
he did not menyelingkuhimu.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:39.603
True, it's like
he did it.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:47.446
If you still want to stay you may need a friend or something
to keep your thinking end the relationship with him.

01:07:47.472 --> 01:07:49.414
- Good idea

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.711
There is another idea?

01:09:25.305 --> 01:09:26.362
paper like dew

01:10:56.514 --> 01:11:01.928
Here goes into his hall

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.025
This is beautiful

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.195
usually used for meetings.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.381
Well, this is amazing.

01:11:08.416 --> 01:11:10.498
he was already hundreds of years.

01:11:10.533 --> 01:11:12.735
I think Josh and Molly will like it.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:13.801
Not so bad.

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:16.172
As you can see, there are
French influence in the whole room.

01:11:16.207 --> 01:11:18.272
Beautiful accessories and scenery also ...

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:21.708
- We want the roundtable.
- You can do whatever you want.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.078
Josh and Molly will be very happy ...

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.046
when they see what we have found for them.

01:11:26.749 --> 01:11:27.841
It is beautiful.

01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:52.842
We may see again
on the dance floor?

01:11:52.877 --> 01:11:55.242
- Sure, here.
- Thank you.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:33.315
-Please.
- You go first.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.613
No, no, no please!

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:36.751
No, please!

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:39.320
I'm after you.

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:41.891
Only a while.
Unless you want to go.

01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:43.325
- No no no.
- Correct. I will.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:47.261
I'll make breakfast.

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:56.801
How are you with Giselle?

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.108
You know, Good!

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:08.314
He was great at sex.

01:13:25.468 --> 01:13:27.485
Molly, I'm serious!

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.503
I'm too serious and I want a bath.

01:13:36.603 --> 01:13:42.875
I love that place.
yap, you can pick me up!

01:13:57.116 --> 01:13:59.932
I can not .
I have a plan.

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:02.194
Okay.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.768
Actually,
This kind of dating.

01:14:07.076 --> 01:14:08.236

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:14.009
-You Do not mind, is not it?
- Yes, of course.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.282
- Molly.
- Yes

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:16.308
Come on.
I want to show you something.

01:14:16.379 --> 01:14:18.252
Your mother is a blessing.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:07.102
Dude, what are we doing here?

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:11.868
What? She was sexy.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:17.272
Okay. We went to the Wrigleyville.

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.804
So you come in late at night, overnight.

01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:47.275
The band entered, then ...

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.408
Did you have fun?

01:15:50.079 --> 01:15:52.013
Yes actually, yes.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.616
I do not know about what today's celebration

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.052
but thinking about going to dinner at Brunahs.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.246
I can not tonight.

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.791
What? you've got another date?

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:07.561
Actually, yes.

01:16:19.108 --> 01:16:21.075
And he studied architecture.

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:26.548
This vegetarian, plays drums
weekends, and ready?

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:29.709
- He's English.
- Tidaak ...!

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:33.689
Why not?
you're left with another man.

01:16:33.724 --> 01:16:36.459
I know, it's weird. It's strange...

01:16:36.494 --> 01:16:39.194
I stopped working a while ...

01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:41.061
for the parents of my fiance ...

01:16:41.096 --> 01:16:43.264
when planning our wedding.

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.801
Oh yes may I,
I ask a question?

01:16:45.836 --> 01:16:48.326
Why are you torturing yourself?

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:51.106
Josh gives you a chance to get out.
Why not accept?

01:16:51.141 --> 01:16:52.775
Could go home ...

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:54.375
and have a normal dating.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:56.176
Do you see one of my ex-girlfriend?

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:58.771
The last thing I can afford
I have a date that is normal.

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:04.153
I know this may sound strange,
but living with Josh ...

01:17:04.188 --> 01:17:08.180
Shows what I want
in the relationship.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.994
I began to ignore the sex part.

01:17:12.029 --> 01:17:13.594
It does not.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:17.895
- Unfortunately, this is very sad.
- Very.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:22.504
Wait a minute.
I thought it was my phone.

01:17:22.539 --> 01:17:25.064
Let me see if it's not a nanny.

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:27.966
- This is not good.
- What?

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:31.613
I think I left
phone in the apartment.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:33.549
- Forgive me.
- No, it's okay.

01:17:33.584 --> 01:17:35.751
Forgive me.
It's something that I ...

01:17:35.786 --> 01:17:36.911
Come on.

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:39.404
I know where
and I'm sorry.

01:17:39.439 --> 01:17:41.490
- It is okay.
- Forgive me.

01:17:41.525 --> 01:17:43.219
Surprise!

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:44.825
Okay.

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:47.563
If you through the bad stuff
about the engagement ...

01:17:47.598 --> 01:17:49.365
You can also pass some good things.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.696
You set me up.

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:55.266
- Hi
- I'm very excited.

01:17:55.301 --> 01:17:57.797
you're doing a good job.

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.005
What are we talking about?

01:18:01.744 --> 01:18:03.268
Jeff Prosky.

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:08.283
Okay. But even if he does not
deal, do not buy a lot.

01:18:08.318 --> 01:18:10.911
I can handle Jeff Prosky.
Do not worry.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.783
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:16.752
Relax.
I'm just going to chew it.

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:21.997
I'm not a mother.
If you chew a cigar makes you happy, then ...

01:18:22.032 --> 01:18:24.989
Smoking will make me happy, but I'm not complaining.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.167
And you, Josh? Are you happy?

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:30.603
- I mean in the workplace?
- Not

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:33.166
I mean with Molly.

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:37.807
Well .. Finally something practical.

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.946
sexualmu life is none of your business.

01:18:42.184 --> 01:18:46.120
I'm talking about the rest.
Do you laugh together?

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.053
You laugh about things that are very small or
usually good?

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:56.487
You know, I have to say that
usually good.

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.433
I mean, we fight, but ...

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:03.029
Listen, son.
If you're married, going against.

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:08.202
The secret is knowing how to fight.
Think of how great the wedding?

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:11.947
If you've menikahkau will feel safe ...

01:19:11.982 --> 01:19:15.246
then joined together

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:19.199
and will realize that he wants to stay with the ...

01:19:19.234 --> 01:19:22.547
who chose to laugh at the absurdity of it all.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.025
You feel such feelings
with Molly?

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:28.054
Yes Yes Yes

01:19:28.797 --> 01:19:30.664
Josh, what I mean is ...

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.792
can be yourself
near Molly?

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.532
Honestly ...

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:43.737
I'm more comfortable with
Molly Mahoney compared ..

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:48.815
with other people.

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.953
how do you know he is the right person?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.829
He was in Los Angeles
when I got there.

01:20:00.864 --> 01:20:04.356
So I went with him to some parties, and ...

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.459
and we want each other.

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:13.104
Is that all? Come on.
We want more detail.

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.509
When I heard he was going to marry him?

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:18.714
When he brings you to a romantic weekend
The first?

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:22.982
The first time you slept together?

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.916
Actually, we sleep together
the first time when he was 10 years old.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.620
was at a birthday party Amy Gerson.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:34.394
Come on, Molly.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:38.267
It will not work subdue too.
Josh has always been a player.

01:20:38.302 --> 01:20:39.928
when you make it to its knees?

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:42.804
It's like you're just seeing this flirty guy.

01:20:42.839 --> 01:20:45.329
Under fashion apparel ...

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.509
he big boaster.

01:20:48.544 --> 01:20:54.049
It is one of the
people are more generous, gentle ...

01:20:54.084 --> 01:20:56.574
and a very caring person
I have ever met.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:01.186
And do not imagine passing
the rest of my life with others.

01:21:22.511 --> 01:21:24.570
How bridal showermu false?

01:21:25.681 --> 01:21:27.665

Yes, I had a nice time.

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.322
Want to see the best thing that I have?

01:21:33.357 --> 01:21:35.222
- Yeah yeah.
- Is it true?

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:39.461
Yes I have to fear?

01:21:39.496 --> 01:21:41.326
No, but must wait.

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:46.233
- I'm a little nervous.
- Do not.

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:51.940
You know I could spin
and look at you now.

01:21:51.975 --> 01:21:53.976
Do not do it!
This will not be a surprise.

01:21:54.011 --> 01:21:55.102
Okay.

01:23:00.275 --> 01:23:01.867
I can try.

01:23:32.607 --> 01:23:35.577
Molly, Molly, Molly.
I can not.

01:23:35.612 --> 01:23:38.307

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:41.482

- No pressure.

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:17.009
- You know what I think?
- What?

01:24:18.854 --> 01:24:20.956
Even rabbits rest, Josh.

01:24:20.991 --> 01:24:23.390
Okay.
What was I thinking?

01:24:23.425 --> 01:24:25.694
Well, we have to do something to show ...

01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:27.963

01:24:27.998 --> 01:24:29.021
Okay.

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.217
There are a million details
to plan a wedding.

01:24:32.252 --> 01:24:34.703
Everything must be seen
and contracted in advance.

01:24:34.738 --> 01:24:37.729
- I'm listening.
- I thought it would be fun ...

01:24:38.039 --> 01:24:40.375
if we let our parents do the heavy lifting ...

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:43.344
and we make things fun.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:47.211
How it might be fun
to plan a wedding?

01:24:49.985 --> 01:24:51.418
Select the target you, sir.

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:54.618
- Selected target.
- Giant Hands?

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:55.956
- No no no.
- What?

01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:58.043
- Heated Cellar better.
- You are crazy...

01:24:58.078 --> 01:25:00.095
- If you think you can hit.
- Ten dollar hit.

01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:01.357
Good. Take note!

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.297
- Are you ready?
- Yes

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:07.526
With his left hand.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:13.306
you're missing.

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:15.375
You cheater ...

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.145
- And I will kill you now.
- You owe me ten bucks.

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.761
- This is how it is.
- Are dead.

01:25:18.796 --> 01:25:20.343
Someone owe ten dollars.

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.385
- Ten dollars.
- I melt your brain ...

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.120
with a ray gun to me.

01:25:25.155 --> 01:25:26.453
I will say one thing.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.257
It's a chance to recover my money ...

01:25:29.292 --> 01:25:31.992
and I'll tell you how.
Anything in this store ...

01:25:32.027 --> 01:25:34.362
whatever you choose and will hit
I laser guns.

01:25:34.397 --> 01:25:35.329
- Anything?
- Yes

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.054
Come on.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.700
- Blankets of it.
- Done.

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.171
No no no.
That does not. Exist.

01:25:43.206 --> 01:25:44.263
Come on.

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.774
Do not know how I'm going to spend
I was ten dollars.

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:48.775
I feel like the world is cangkangkuku.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.940
- I bought almost everything ...
- You want to play?

01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.486
Do not ruin it.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:00.655
I just say to not spoil everything.

01:26:00.690 --> 01:26:02.213
I'm worried about you.

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.858
- What?
- Yeah, boy!

01:26:04.893 --> 01:26:06.695
Just call me a child in public?

01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:07.889
- What?
- Josh.

01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:10.697
Giselle.

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:15.303
Josh, a pleasant surprise.
I went, but ...

01:26:15.338 --> 01:26:17.205
No no no.
It is okay.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.440
- Yes
- Okay.

01:26:18.475 --> 01:26:20.567
Truly.

01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:23.611
I will be in the lingerie section.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:33.188
- you look great.
- Thank you.

01:26:33.223 --> 01:26:34.348
I miss.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:47.360
This is it!

01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:01.114
- What?
- Where are you?

01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:03.551
We are waiting for you at the buffet.

01:27:03.586 --> 01:27:04.711
What?

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:10.625
The lemon sauce melt
at the back of the tongue ...

01:27:10.660 --> 01:27:13.458
wafer as a condiment.

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.929
I agree.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:21.469
Now, smoked jalapeno pepper Stavros ...

01:27:21.504 --> 01:27:24.504
so delicious, you can eat by himself.

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:28.743
But if you play jalapeno pepper
Nikkos more temperate ...

01:27:28.778 --> 01:27:30.578
- Perfect!
- It's mine.

01:27:30.613 --> 01:27:32.259
- This is it.
- I'm doing it.

01:27:32.294 --> 01:27:33.905
What's wrong with you?

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.084
I said I was not hungry.

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:40.715
So you can not pretend you're having fun?

01:27:41.690 --> 01:27:45.393
Let me prove one thing
jalapeno.

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:46.883
Of course.

01:27:47.295 --> 01:27:49.125
You can not eat pepper.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:50.955
What will you do? Kill me?

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.227
Not funny.

01:27:57.505 --> 01:28:00.075
So much fun.
Are you sure you do not want to try?

01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:01.372
I have.

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:05.013
And now we serve
i what is called Nikkos ...

01:28:05.048 --> 01:28:07.213
"Dilemma groom"!

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:12.948
Must choose between the ahi carpaccio and spicy tuna.

01:28:13.555 --> 01:28:14.988
I want them both.

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.623
Can not have both, Josh.

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:19.092
you have to commit to one or the other.

01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:22.394
you can have both.
So everyone is happy.

01:28:23.198 --> 01:28:24.756
What a dilemma.

01:28:27.836 --> 01:28:31.237
What wedding without a cake?

01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:35.570
- Sold. Looks good.
- I also.

01:28:42.384 --> 01:28:45.820
This is it. Molly, you should try this cake.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.850
I can not do it again.

01:28:49.657 --> 01:28:51.989
- We have other snacks.
- Lots of cake.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:53.927
What happened to you?

01:28:53.962 --> 01:28:55.469
This.

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:59.992
Buffet, photographer,
engagement, everyone.

01:29:01.469 --> 01:29:02.635
Josh, just.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.638
I'm sorry, Mr. Shiffman.

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.265
Molly.

01:29:07.609 --> 01:29:08.803
Give me a moment.

01:29:17.419 --> 01:29:19.686
Molly, wait.

01:29:19.721 --> 01:29:21.254
- Let me go.
- No no.

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:23.091
Not until you tell me what happened.

01:29:23.126 --> 01:29:24.524
- Why do it?
- I do not know.

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:27.429
- This is because Giselle?
- Not because of Giselle.

01:29:27.464 --> 01:29:29.529
- It's about last night?
- I can not.

01:29:29.564 --> 01:29:31.399
- We can talk about this?
- I just can not

01:29:31.434 --> 01:29:34.202
- Why not?

01:29:34.237 --> 01:29:36.170
That's because, I fell in love with you

01:30:08.938 --> 01:30:10.871
Champagne for everyone!

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.402
What's with Max?

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:18.668
Call 911 now!

01:31:02.857 --> 01:31:05.257
What do you know
needed to do this?

01:31:06.528 --> 01:31:08.189
I do not know.

01:31:13.601 --> 01:31:16.001
Do you think he saw me
grab your ass?

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:18.866
Okay. So you look at his catch
ass.

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:22.069
But you know they
sleep together, right?

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:25.809
You and Josh are just friends, right?

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.409
Okay?

01:31:30.351 --> 01:31:31.875
It's complicated.

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:35.447
Molly.

01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:48.833
Molly and I have lived together, you know.

01:31:49.037 --> 01:31:51.801
And we can ...

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:57.905
We may sleep together, we sleep together.

01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:01.880
I think you're not the first
sleep with the bride and groom themselves.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:05.132
- Giselle, I ...
- Josh, we are friends with benefits.

01:32:05.167 --> 01:32:08.182
One explanation is that we do not
no bond to each other.

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:13.617
So you're saying back
that you will be happy ...

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:18.032
FRIENDS IN BENEFIT relationship?

01:32:18.067 --> 01:32:19.192
Not me...

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:21.365
So what do you want?

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:26.406
I do not know. During my life ...

01:32:26.441 --> 01:32:31.003
He just strange red-haired woman
annoying.

01:32:32.914 --> 01:32:36.577
I think that's it, and now ...

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:41.518
I do not want to be with other people ...

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:45.391
except with the red-haired geeky and annoying.

01:32:47.195 --> 01:32:49.686
If you want something more,
should tell him.

01:32:50.231 --> 01:32:53.530
Do not take it wrong. I would hate to
missed our date Sunday afternoon ...

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:57.605
but if you think
find someone you want to stay ...

01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:59.138
and if he wants to be with you ...

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:02.836
even on the bad days,
and does not want to shave anything ...

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:08.349
and he saw you as if
a Victoria Secret model ...

01:33:08.384 --> 01:33:10.613
Sweatshirt and jeans ...

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:14.214
do not give up.

01:33:14.722 --> 01:33:18.351
If you think you would have it
with all that you slept with, it will not.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:19.986
I do not know.

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.929
I do not know. I do not know.
I do not know.

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:27.123
I do not plan to say "I love you".

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.630
Just get out.

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:35.499
At least he knows how you feel.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:40.973
The question is:
how he feels about you?

01:33:43.785 --> 01:33:46.515
Rescued by telephone. Mrs

01:33:49.324 --> 01:33:51.726
I'm sure he'll be fine.

01:33:51.761 --> 01:33:53.728
you'll see.
Max is a fighter.

01:33:53.763 --> 01:33:54.827
Josh will come.

01:33:54.862 --> 01:33:56.462
Thank you, God,
what did you say to him?

01:33:56.497 --> 01:33:59.799
- That Max had a stroke.
- Suspected Stroke.

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:05.466
Suspicions?
My husband holding his chest, out of breath.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.104
And damn red as a lobster.

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.109
You're not helping.

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:13.773
Some of you have medical training?

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:17.776
Listen, nurses, anyone your name.

01:34:18.019 --> 01:34:22.388
I know my husband,
and he had a heart attack!

01:34:32.834 --> 01:34:35.803
- What did you say, young man?
- Reflux oesophagitis.

01:34:35.838 --> 01:34:38.829
- Reflux oesophagitis?
- Heartburn, Heartburn Max.

01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:43.508
Here. Take two
and this would be good, right?

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:45.880
But just to make sure, let's do some more tests
, Right?

01:34:45.915 --> 01:34:48.314
Certain. is fun to be a doctor?

01:34:49.384 --> 01:34:51.501
Tell my wife
smoothly.

01:34:51.536 --> 01:34:53.619
Family I have a tendency to exaggerate.

01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.081
you can leave, Max

01:34:55.256 --> 01:34:57.156
Nurse would bring water!

01:35:00.561 --> 01:35:02.788
Let's find someone to ask.

01:35:03.898 --> 01:35:06.133
Sorry.
Do you know where the emergency room?

01:35:06.168 --> 01:35:08.369
- Look for Max Shiffman.
- I'm the doctor.

01:35:08.404 --> 01:35:09.669
Is she okay?

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:12.537
Okay for now.
Just a little heartburn.

01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:15.041
- Good riddance!
- Good.

01:35:15.243 --> 01:35:16.509
Can we see it or ...?

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:19.147
Sure, you and your wife can watch
within half an hour.

01:35:19.182 --> 01:35:20.808
- We're not married.
- We're just friends.

01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.239
Okay.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.953
- Thank you.
Welcome.

01:35:29.490 --> 01:35:32.192
- Are you serious?
- Yes, it will be out soon.

01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:37.557
God, I'm sorry.

01:35:38.266 --> 01:35:41.169
This is all my fault.
I experienced a major crisis.

01:35:41.204 --> 01:35:43.194
Do not love.
It's not your fault.

01:35:43.538 --> 01:35:46.507
I know that only engagement.

01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:48.134
Do you know?

01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:52.180
I saw Josh with another woman
Blackstone Hotel.

01:35:52.215 --> 01:35:53.146
No

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:56.117
- I think I'd be more educated.
- No, Ms. Shiffman.

01:35:56.152 --> 01:35:58.885
We never really honest with you!

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.322
- You raised a good man.
- We are looking for Max Shiffman.

01:36:01.357 --> 01:36:02.721
No, I have not trained it.

01:36:03.825 --> 01:36:06.191
- He did not.
- No you do not.

01:36:06.561 --> 01:36:07.755
Yes, right.

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:11.397
just heard the good news.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:13.901
you have a lot of courage to bring this whore
here.

01:36:13.936 --> 01:36:15.970
Who are you calling a bitch?

01:36:16.005 --> 01:36:18.171
I saw you with at the hotel.

01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:21.442
God. Mother, why
are so crazy lately?

01:36:21.477 --> 01:36:22.670
So is it true?

01:36:23.478 --> 01:36:27.539
Damn! Molly and I do not
really engaged!

01:36:28.049 --> 01:36:30.818
engaged or not,
I can not believe you brought her here ...

01:36:30.853 --> 01:36:32.753
after sleeping with Molly.

01:36:32.788 --> 01:36:34.320
you sleep with Molly?

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:36.390
- You slept with my sister?
- Sean, you do not understand.

01:36:36.425 --> 01:36:38.426
I understand, yes. He's just one more
their girlfriends.

01:36:38.461 --> 01:36:40.328
- He was my brother!
- No, man! Not like that!

01:36:40.363 --> 01:36:41.852
- So how?
- I love her.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:44.556
Do you love me?

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:50.570
Yes I love you.

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:53.639
I love you.

01:36:54.075 --> 01:36:55.508
I love you, Molly.

01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:01.716
You say
the truth about my brother?

01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:03.911
Retreated slightly.

01:37:04.886 --> 01:37:07.255
Grab some ice.
He'll be fine.

01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:09.450
God. Oh, my God,
sorry.

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:12.482
Forgive me.
Do not know why I hit you.

01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:14.592

01:37:30.478 --> 01:37:32.503
and I want you to have it.

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.217
Not because of my dad, but because
I can not imagine ...

01:37:36.252 --> 01:37:39.243
spend one more minute of my life without you.

01:37:39.887 --> 01:37:41.718

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:59.169
Can anyone tell me what happened?

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.338
Do you want to tell him or should I?
