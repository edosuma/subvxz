03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
I had you 
 dead to rights, Ray.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.480
Just a little bit of space 
 between you and the ground.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.680
But we'll be back.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.400

Are you Louis Driscoll?

04:16.839 --> 04:18.720
Uh, yeah.

04:18.720 --> 04:23.320
Did you know you saved the life 
 of the son of Senator Abernathy?

04:23.320 --> 04:24.400
I did?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.640
What's it like 
 to be a hero, Louis?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.720

 have your autograph?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.720
Sure.

Good to see you.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.040
What's your name?

04:40.040 --> 04:41.560
Boy: 
 Hey, me, too!

04:47.960 --> 04:49.320
Can you believe him?

04:49.320 --> 04:52.840
Three interviews and not once 
 did he mention our names.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.400
We were there, too.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.440
Alex, he's the hero 
 and he did lift the pipe.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.200
Hey, maybe I should get an 
 autograph as an investment.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.840
Ray, I lifted the pipe.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.880
Look, Alex, 
 don't be jealous.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.200
You'll have your day 
 in the sun.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.840
Ray, don't you get it?

05:08.840 --> 05:11.240
I lifted the pipe 
 with my powers.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.360
There's no way he could have 
 lifted it himself.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.480
You did?

05:15.480 --> 05:17.440
You did.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.400
Can you believe this?

05:24.680 --> 05:27.320
I was single-minded 
 with determination.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.760
I risked life and limb 
 and put my own safety aside.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.960
I called upon every fiber 
 in my body.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.680
And I found a force, 
 deep within.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.600
Listen to that.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.880
Louis, we still on to shoot 
 some hoops after school?

05:40.880 --> 05:42.320
No can do, Ray.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.680
I've got some more interviews, 
 booked solid.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.160
Okay, tomorrow.

05:47.160 --> 05:48.320
We'll see.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.080
Keep in touch.

05:54.160 --> 05:56.080
Keep in touch?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.920
Vince: 
 I hope that it was

05:59.920 --> 06:01.960
a productive trip, 
 Miss Atron.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.040
Yes, in the sense 
 that it gave me a good chance

06:05.040 --> 06:08.040
to review the work 
 that we've been doing here.

06:08.040 --> 06:11.600
For example, I have been 
 thinking about how long

06:11.600 --> 06:15.200
you've been searching 
 for that GC-161 kid.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.120
I'm getting closer.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.520
I'm getting tired 
 of waiting.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.000
So I've hired an expert.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.840
An... expert?

06:28.800 --> 06:29.520
Hello.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.640
Vince, I'd like you 
 to meet Judd Dubrow.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.200
He'll be overseeing 
 our search.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.880
But that's my assignment.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.880
Judd's a security consultant.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.000
He'll advise us

06:43.000 --> 06:44.360
on the best 
 approach

06:44.360 --> 06:46.960
merely to expedite the search.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.880
You mean...

06:48.880 --> 06:50.360
That I...

06:50.360 --> 06:53.400
Have to answer... to him?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.040
No, no.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.440
Not necessarily.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.200
You could always quit.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.680
<i>( Kids shouting and laughing )</i>

07:07.680 --> 07:10.960
So, are we going to 
 meet up at the diamond?

07:10.960 --> 07:13.600
Is, um, is Louis 
 going to be there?

07:13.600 --> 07:17.000
Why do you care if Louis 
 is going to be there or not?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.840
Well, it is pretty exciting 
 being around him right now.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.040
All the attention he is getting 
 is making me sick.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.760
If it hadn't have been

07:25.760 --> 07:27.520
a senator's son 
 he'd saved

07:27.520 --> 07:29.840
no one would be 
 talking about it.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.640
Even if it is 
 kind of heroic.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.520
The only way I'll know 
 about being a hero

07:34.520 --> 07:38.120
is if I live vicariously 
 through Louis Driscoll.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.160
Although it is kind of sad

07:40.160 --> 07:43.360
that the only way I get 
 to experience excitement

07:43.360 --> 07:44.720
is through the life

07:44.720 --> 07:46.320
of another annoying 
 eighth grader.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.320
So, anybody want 
 to carry my books?

08:00.480 --> 08:03.000
This is horrible to watch.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.760
What did 
 you expect, Alex

08:08.760 --> 08:10.680
he did save 
 a kid's life.

You with us here?

08:30.360 --> 08:31.360
Yeah.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.880
Yeah, I guess so.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.480
Dubrow: Things are going 
 to change around here.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.600
The names of every single 
 kid in paradise valley

08:45.600 --> 08:48.400
are about to be entered 
 into that database.

08:48.400 --> 08:52.120
All we need to do is compile 
 the data, set the parameters

08:52.120 --> 08:54.640
and we will soon 
 find the name we need.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.040
So, start inputting.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.000
This... is not 
 the correct approach.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
And I... 
 Am not a clerk.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.680
I'm a highly trained 
 operative.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.280
With many years...

09:05.280 --> 09:07.960
I don't think 
 you understand my job.

 to find the kid.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.880
And right now, your 
 opinions are meaningless.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.640
Do I make myself 
 clear?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.360
Loud and clear.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.400
Now get to work.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.600
Vince, get over here.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.600
Who's this?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.280
One of the local kids.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.680
Well, this local kid

09:46.680 --> 09:49.080
just lifted a pipe 
 twice his size

09:49.080 --> 09:50.280
made of concrete.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.800
How does a normal kid 
 achieve that?

09:52.800 --> 09:54.600
Aren't we looking 
 for a kid

09:54.600 --> 09:56.880
with unusual abilities 
 or talents?

09:56.880 --> 09:58.400
Yes, we are.

09:58.400 --> 10:00.600
And a kid lifting 
 a pipe like that

10:00.600 --> 10:03.200
seems pretty unusual, 
 wouldn't you say?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.640
Let me check it out.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.560
You do that.

The kid was living

 occurred.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.840
<i>If you'd followed up, sir</i>

11:21.840 --> 11:23.360
you would have found out

11:23.360 --> 11:26.120
his family was house-hunting 
 here that week.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.320
We don't know whether 
 the kid was with them or not.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.400
There is only

<i>without being 
 obvious, sir.</i>

11:33.120 --> 11:34.240
I'm listening.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.800
We see if he 
 can do it again.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.280
We stage an event

11:38.280 --> 11:40.040
and when he lifts it

11:40.040 --> 11:44.040
bingo-- we have our proof 
 and we have our kid.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.840
It's a ridiculous idea.

11:45.840 --> 11:50.280
Just because the kid lifts a 
 pipe doesn't prove anything.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.720

He lifts it and bingo

12:01.840 --> 12:03.480
I don't know, Dubrow.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.840
Just because 
 a kid lifts a pipe

12:05.840 --> 12:07.840
it doesn't prove 
 anything.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.120
Besides, 
 it sounds expensive.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.520
Trust me, Ms. Atron.

It may be

12:40.440 --> 12:43.240
I knew you had 
 to be involved somehow.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.480
It's not fair.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.040
Louis is getting 
 all the attention.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.160
That's the way 
 it should be.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.200
Alex, listen.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.440
True heroes act anonymously.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.000
They never seek the spotlight.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.800
Especially...

12:56.800 --> 13:00.000
Heroes with secret powers.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.400
You should help people 
 because they need your help

13:03.400 --> 13:05.520
not for attention.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.360
I guess.

13:07.360 --> 13:12.480
I just wish he would have 
 mentioned me and Ray once.

13:12.480 --> 13:16.080
He's enjoying this all 
 way too much.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.440
World peace? That's easy.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.440
If everyone would stop 
 thinking about themselves

13:21.440 --> 13:24.360
and start paying attention 
 to their fellow man

13:24.360 --> 13:27.640
um, the world would be 
 a better place.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.320
Nicole: 
 World peace?

13:29.320 --> 13:33.200
The guy lifts a pipe and he's 
 being asked about world peace?

13:33.200 --> 13:36.320
Alex is right, 
 the guy's gone too far.

13:36.320 --> 13:38.360
"...that which is right.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.360
For that shall bring man 
 true peace at last."

13:41.360 --> 13:42.360
You Louis Driscoll?

13:42.360 --> 13:43.400
Yes, I am.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.640
Bob Cook.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.600
Paradise Valley 
 chamber of commerce.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.440
It is a pleasure to meet you.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.400
You have an award 
 or something?

13:50.400 --> 13:51.480
Or something.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.480
I'm here on 
 behalf of the city.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.960
We're looking for ways

13:54.960 --> 13:56.760
to promote 
 Paradise Valley.

13:56.760 --> 13:59.960
It's a way to boost 
 business growth in the area.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.560
Your act of heroism 
 is a perfect example

14:02.560 --> 14:05.280
of what makes Paradise 
 Valley so special!

14:05.280 --> 14:07.320
And we want 
 to tell the world.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.840
Be my guest.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.360
I'm a little busy 
 this afternoon, though.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.000
What do you want me to do?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.200
We're shooting 
 a promotional video.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.960
We want you to reenact 
 your act of heroism

14:17.960 --> 14:20.880
and have you move 
 that pipe again.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.800
If you think you still can.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.880
Girl: 
 Of course he can.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.960
Yeah.

14:25.960 --> 14:27.600
Of course I can.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.240
Excellent.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.520
Your city thanks you.

14:35.520 --> 14:39.000
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

14:41.440 --> 14:43.920
Man, the attention is nonstop.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.280
Yeah, 
 we noticed.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.320
Look...

14:46.320 --> 14:48.520
I didn't ask 
 for any of this.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.800
But the world 
 is starved for heroes

14:50.800 --> 14:53.120
and I came along 
 at the right time.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.720
Louis, a little modesty 
 could go a long way here.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.600
Nicole, most of the school 
 thought I was a jerk.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.320
I proved them wrong, didn't I?

15:01.320 --> 15:03.640
If you manage 
 to lift the pipe again.

15:03.640 --> 15:04.800
Otherwise...

15:04.800 --> 15:07.800
All this is going 
 to change in a hurry.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.520
So, you going 
 to help him?

15:18.520 --> 15:19.960
Why should I?

15:19.960 --> 15:22.400
He'll be laughed 
 out of school.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.520
And the problem 
 with that is?

15:24.520 --> 15:26.400
Alex, it's not 
 his fault.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.800
He doesn't know 
 you helped him.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.200
He really does think 
 he's a hero.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.040
Yeah, but look how 
 he's behaved ever since.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.120
Besides, it won't be 
 that easy.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.600
People will be there.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.000
I can't risk getting 
 seen using my powers.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.840
I mean, look at him.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.000
It's his one moment 
 in the spotlight.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.320
It may be his last chance 
 not to be considered a dork.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.880
Ray, look at the way 
 he's treated you.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.240
He's practically 
 ignored both of us

15:56.240 --> 15:58.400
since this whole 
 thing happened.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.920
We've been dumped 
 by Louis Driscoll.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.280
<i>Alex: Ray thinks that 
 the right thing to do</i>

16:05.280 --> 16:07.040
is to help Louis again.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.560
If I don't, they'll laugh 
 Louis out of school.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.760
And the problem with that is...?

16:13.760 --> 16:15.960
That's what I said.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.160
Well, anyways, 
 it's too risky.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.200
There's going to be 
 a lot of people there

16:21.200 --> 16:24.800
and you can't take the chance 
 of getting caught.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.880
Okay.

16:26.880 --> 16:30.440
Now, I'm going to test 
 the independence

16:30.440 --> 16:32.880
of your molecular 
 structure.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.600
Whatever.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.240
It won't hurt a bit.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.320
Go ahead and stay 
 as small as you can.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.640
Alex: 
 Hey, that tickles!

16:53.640 --> 16:55.000
<i>( Laughing )</i>

17:04.000 --> 17:05.560
Uh-oh.

17:05.560 --> 17:09.079
Don't say "uh-oh," Annie.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.440
How am I going to explain this?!

17:15.440 --> 17:16.760
I'm pretty sure

17:16.760 --> 17:18.359
it'll come off

17:18.359 --> 17:19.920
in the shower.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.320
Annie: 
 See, it came off.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.920
Most of it.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.880
Annie, I still 
 look like a frog.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.800
It's really not that noticeable.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.640
Hey.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.360
You look 
 a little... green.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.600
It's one of 
 Annie's experiments.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.280
It isn't too bad, 
 is it?

17:56.280 --> 17:58.200
I didn't want 
 to miss this.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.200
No, no one will notice it.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.640
Hey!

18:04.640 --> 18:06.040
Good luck!

18:06.040 --> 18:08.560
<i>( Desperate moan )</i>

18:08.560 --> 18:11.000
So, are you going 
 to help him?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.960
Annie says 
 I shouldn't risk it.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.040
Besides, he kind 
 of deserves

18:15.040 --> 18:17.200
to be laughed 
 out of school.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.200
<i>Well, not laughed out, 
 just laughed at.</i>

18:20.200 --> 18:23.320
Alex, Louis is our friend.

18:23.320 --> 18:24.920
Don't do that to me.

18:24.920 --> 18:27.520
Besides, what if someone 
 sees me?

18:27.520 --> 18:29.360
No one's watching us.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.680
Nicole: 
 Excuse me.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.720
I have to admit, 
 this is pretty cool.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.880
Alex, you realize 
 you're a little green?

18:36.880 --> 18:39.120
Oh, yeah, I'm not 
 feeling too well.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.800
Nicole, did you catch the 
 Louis Driscoll coffee mugs?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.440
You know, I hate that.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.120
A person does something 
 totally selfless

18:49.120 --> 18:52.400
and people immediately 
 try to make a buck off it.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.280
Louis: 
 Hey, you guys.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.040
Glad you could make it.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.600
I got something special 
 planned for you

18:58.600 --> 19:00.840
during my speech today.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.320
All right.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.000
Dubrow: 
 Thank you.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Thank you all

19:12.000 --> 19:14.080
for coming out here 
 to pay tribute

19:14.080 --> 19:15.880
to Paradise Valley's 
 own hero

19:15.880 --> 19:17.680
Louis Driscoll.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.480
<i>( Applause )</i>

19:19.480 --> 19:20.760
Louis: 
 Cool. Thanks.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.840
<i>( Whistles )</i>

19:21.840 --> 19:24.040
Thank you.

19:24.040 --> 19:25.200
Thank you.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.400
I appreciate your kind words

19:27.400 --> 19:29.440
your gifts, your thoughts.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.600
Being here again

19:31.600 --> 19:35.280
the events of the other day 
 are flooding back to me

19:35.280 --> 19:37.920
and it reminds me 
 to thank two people

19:37.920 --> 19:39.720
who deserve 
 recognition--

19:39.720 --> 19:43.400
my friends, Alex Mack 
 and Raymond Alvarado.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.440
They were here, too.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.920
And if it hadn't been me 
 saving Matthew Abernathy

19:48.920 --> 19:50.960
it would have 
 been them.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.360
Thank you, Louis.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.640
Shall we begin?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.400
Louis: 
 Uh...

19:57.560 --> 19:59.240
Sure.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.440
<i>( Grunts )</i>

20:23.120 --> 20:24.600
<i>( Grunts )</i>

20:31.880 --> 20:33.680
Ray, Vince is here.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.480
He is?

20:36.480 --> 20:37.880
Ray, check it out

20:37.880 --> 20:39.520
this whole thing 
 is a setup.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.080
Alex, no one 
 is paying to you.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.600
Help Louis.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.960
Don't you get it?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.600
They think Louis 
 is the GC-161 kid.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.440
Who else could have 
 lifted that pipe?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.680
Hey, you're right.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.600
Now I really 
 can't help him.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.640
If I do, they'll think 
 that he has the powers

20:56.640 --> 20:58.920
or worse, they'll see 
 that I do.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.960
Ray, I can't do it.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.920
Now I'm starting 
 to glow.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.280
<i>Louis: Up until now, most of 
 the school thought I was a jerk.</i>

21:12.280 --> 21:14.560
<i> I guess I proved them wrong, 
 didn't I?</i>

21:14.560 --> 21:17.680
<i>Nicole: That is, if you 
 manage to lift the pipe again.</i>

21:17.680 --> 21:20.640

 is going to change in a hurry.</i>

21:27.600 --> 21:28.360
<i>( Grunts )</i>

21:28.360 --> 21:29.160
<i>( All cheering )</i>

21:39.880 --> 21:42.000
Those weren't the actions 
 of a kid

21:42.000 --> 21:43.840
with any special abilities.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.760
He was struggling, 
 his head nearly exploded.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.280
I said it was 
 a shot in the dark.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.760
You know, I think 
I have wasted

21:51.760 --> 21:54.360
just about enough 
 time and money

21:54.360 --> 21:55.840
on this 
 little charade.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.360
Perhaps I won't be needing 
 your services.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.800
At least not for now.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.760
Vince, see to it

22:01.760 --> 22:03.920
that Mr. Dubrow 
 gathers his belongings

22:03.920 --> 22:06.160
and is relieved of 
 his security status.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.920
With pleasure, Miss Atron.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.920
Let's see if you can 
 find this kid, Vince.

22:11.920 --> 22:15.400
If you don't, maybe we'll 
 see each other again.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.720
Don't count on it.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.720
I didn't think you could do it 
 a second time, Louis.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.720
I wasn't so sure 
 myself, Ray.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.520
It seemed a lot harder 
 than the first time.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.720
You were under 
 a lot of pressure

22:40.720 --> 22:42.520
with the crowd 
 and cameras.

22:42.520 --> 22:43.720
Yeah, I guess so.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.920
Well, anyway, 
 I'm done with fame--

22:45.920 --> 22:47.360
for a while at least.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.360
It's not worth 
 the pressure.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.200
That's true.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.160
It's all so fleeting.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.920
Sure is.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.800
