00:00.083 --> 00:02.333
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.917 --> 00:05.500
<i>Victor made himself perfectly clear.</i>

00:05.583 --> 00:08.709
Whenever I've truly wanted something,
I've always gotten it.

00:08.792 --> 00:10.333
<i>Bree needed to get away.</i>

00:10.417 --> 00:12.208
We're finally taking our honeymoon.

00:12.291 --> 00:14.834
<i>Susan couldn't wait</i>
<i>to pop the question.</i>

00:14.917 --> 00:16.709
Will you marry me?

00:16.792 --> 00:18.709
<i>Lynette received shocking news.</i>

00:18.792 --> 00:21.583
You can see this.
It could be lymphoma.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.917
Why are you so reluctant
to make a commitment to me?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.917
- Because I'm not in love with you.
<i>- And Edie...</i>

00:26.000 --> 00:30.333
- What if we tried to have a baby?
<i>- ...engaged in a dangerous deception.</i>

00:35.333 --> 00:38.750
<i>When Gabrielle Solis</i>
<i>agreed to marry Victor Lang,</i>

00:38.834 --> 00:42.458
<i>she was determined to have</i>
<i>a very traditional wedding.</i>

00:43.875 --> 00:48.417
<i>She was even more determined</i>
<i>to be a very traditional bride.</i>

00:48.500 --> 00:52.792
<i>To that end, the handkerchief</i>
<i>in her cleavage was borrowed,</i>

00:52.875 --> 00:55.417
<i>the garter on her leg was blue,</i>

00:55.500 --> 00:58.458
<i>and the diamonds on her ears</i>
<i>were old.</i>

00:58.542 --> 01:03.458
<i>But sadly for Gabrielle,</i>
<i>something was missing.</i>

01:03.542 --> 01:08.291
<i>And she was about to throw</i>
<i>a traditional fit.</i>

01:08.375 --> 01:09.625
It is after 3:00.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.959
Where the hell is Bree
with my "something new"?

01:12.041 --> 01:14.959
I know her plane landed on time.
She'll probably be here any second.

01:15.041 --> 01:18.125
I should have my head examined
for even agreeing to this.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.959
Who the hell cares
about Swiss jewellery anyway?

01:21.041 --> 01:24.792
Gabby, Bree went out of her way
to buy you that bracelet.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.166
Of course it's the hottest day
of the year.

01:27.250 --> 01:29.959
All the guests are out there
sweating like pigs.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.041
God, at this rate,
my reception's gonna look like

01:32.125 --> 01:33.709
the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

01:33.792 --> 01:37.000
If you're that freaked out,
just get married without the bracelet.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.542
Are you out of your mind?

01:38.625 --> 01:40.917
I can't get married
without my "something new."

01:41.000 --> 01:45.750
Oh, I have an idea.
I just got a lipstick yesterday.

01:45.834 --> 01:48.583
You could wear that.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.417
I just paid a makeup artist
500 bucks to do my face.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.041
Do you really think
I wanna march down the aisle

01:53.125 --> 01:55.583
looking like I just ate a Popsicle?

01:55.667 --> 01:58.625
Okay, it's your big day,
so I'm gonna let that slide.

01:58.709 --> 02:01.500
God, it is 10 after,
and Bree is never late!

02:01.583 --> 02:03.166
Where can she be?

02:05.709 --> 02:07.208
All right, that's it.

02:07.291 --> 02:10.709
After I finish zhuzhing my hair,
tell the preacher it's show time.

02:10.792 --> 02:12.375
I can't believe
my wedding's already ruined

02:12.458 --> 02:14.375
and it hasn't even started.

02:18.834 --> 02:22.417
I am starting to get worried about Bree.
Maybe we should call.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.542
Yeah, I'm calling her cell.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
- It's ringing.
- Oh, good.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.917
- Bree!
- Oh, wow.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.291
- Hello, ladies.
- Is that Bree?

02:40.375 --> 02:42.417
She better not have come
empty-handed.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.542
Oh, I didn't.

02:44.625 --> 02:48.834
<i>As promised, Bree had arrived</i>
<i>with something new.</i>

02:48.917 --> 02:50.375
Holy crap.

02:50.458 --> 02:53.834
<i>And she also brought the bracelet.</i>

03:05.542 --> 03:09.500
<i>Family,</i>
<i>there is nothing more important.</i>

03:09.583 --> 03:13.667
<i>They're the ones we wanna laugh with</i>
<i>during the good times,</i>

03:14.333 --> 03:17.875
<i>and the ones</i>
<i>we need to console us during the bad.</i>

03:20.000 --> 03:23.875
<i>And even though the time comes</i>
<i>when they have to leave us,</i>

03:25.625 --> 03:28.625
<i>their voices still linger in our minds.</i>

03:29.834 --> 03:33.583
<i>And, sometimes,</i>
<i>we can't help but listen.</i>

03:34.709 --> 03:37.750
Tangled web,
that's what you're weaving.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.959
Oh, beat it, Mother.

03:40.041 --> 03:43.000
You really think this little
scheme of yours is gonna work?

03:43.083 --> 03:45.959
Of course it will. Look at him.

03:46.041 --> 03:48.208
He's practically in love with me already.

03:48.291 --> 03:51.542
That's because he thinks
you're gonna give him a baby.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.041
Wait till he finds out
you're still on the pill.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.959
Oh, shut up, would you?

03:57.041 --> 04:00.709
I just thank the good Lord
your father didn't live to see this.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.083
Well, neither did you.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.917
You died alone in a trailer park
watching game shows.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.667
And why should I listen to you?

04:07.750 --> 04:10.875
'Cause I know
what's waiting for you, missy.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.166
This one's gonna leave you
like all the others.

04:15.792 --> 04:20.542
You're going to end up old and alone,
just like I did.

04:29.291 --> 04:30.542
Carlos?

04:32.291 --> 04:34.917
- Carlos?
- Down here, babe!

04:36.083 --> 04:38.542
I'm making you a fruit smoothie.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.291
- Chicken or fish?
- What?

04:46.375 --> 04:48.166
I haven't gotten
your reply card back yet.

04:48.250 --> 04:52.875
- So chicken or fish?
- Oh, right, your wedding. I can't go.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.792
- Why not?
- I'm a jinx.

04:54.875 --> 04:57.125
I went to your last wedding
and look how that turned out.

04:57.208 --> 04:59.709
Come on, Gabby,
we both know it'd be weird if I went.

04:59.792 --> 05:02.959
Okay, maybe a little.
But it'll be weirder if you don't.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.208
Excuse me?

05:04.291 --> 05:05.792
Look, everyone knows
you're living with Edie.

05:05.875 --> 05:07.041
If she shows up alone,

05:07.125 --> 05:08.625
people will think
I asked her not to bring you,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.000
like it bugs me
that you guys are together.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.333
But it does bug you.
You hit the roof when you found out.

05:13.417 --> 05:16.166
Which is why I have to show people
that I'm okay with it!

05:16.250 --> 05:19.041
Please, just consider it
my wedding gift.

05:20.250 --> 05:23.041
Okay, but I'm skipping the ceremony.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.083
What? And just go to the reception?
You can't do that.

05:26.166 --> 05:28.000
I don't want to make a scene.

05:28.083 --> 05:31.166
You'll vow "till death do us part,"
I'll bust out laughing,

05:31.250 --> 05:33.041
people will stare.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.458
Reception starts at 4:00.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.291
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain

05:42.375 --> 05:44.917
would be a cool centrepiece
to a dessert buffet.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.375
Dessert buffet?

05:46.458 --> 05:49.083
We're having a wedding cake, right?
Isn't that dessert?

05:49.166 --> 05:51.083
Yeah, but you have to give people
a choice.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.500
Don't you think a chocolate fountain
would be elegant?

05:53.583 --> 05:58.208
I don't know. You,
a big white dress, melted chocolate.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.375
Am I the only one hearing alarm bells?

06:00.458 --> 06:02.834
Fine, we'll skip the chocolate.

06:02.917 --> 06:05.375
How about a champagne fountain?
Oh, I know.

06:05.458 --> 06:08.959
Maybe we can make the champagne
flow through the ice sculpture.

06:09.041 --> 06:11.166
Don't you think we might be going
a little over the top?

06:11.250 --> 06:14.750
Mike, these are all
fairly standard wedding features.

06:14.834 --> 06:18.750
Now you name one thing
that you think is going over the top.

06:19.959 --> 06:21.542
How about the dove wrangler?

06:21.625 --> 06:24.583
Well, the doves are not
going to release themselves.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.250
Do we really need 40 of them?

06:26.333 --> 06:28.667
Okay, I know that you think
I'm being silly,

06:28.750 --> 06:30.792
but all of our friends
went to Bree's wedding,

06:30.875 --> 06:32.542
and now they're going to Gabby's.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.500
Two months from now,
do we really want them thinking

06:34.583 --> 06:36.583
ours wasn't as nice?

06:36.667 --> 06:40.083
It seems to me our friends wouldn't be
there to make petty comparisons,

06:40.166 --> 06:41.959
they'd be there to celebrate our love.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.125
You would think that, but no.

06:46.041 --> 06:51.208
Come on, this is something that we
have both looked forward to for so long.

06:51.291 --> 06:55.166
- Don't you want it to be perfect?
- Oh, I guess.

06:55.250 --> 06:58.000
- About the doves, though.
- What?

06:59.125 --> 07:02.583
You in a wedding gown,
40 birds circling overhead?

07:02.667 --> 07:04.834
Again, not liking those odds.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.792
Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.500
It's Hodgkin's lymphoma

07:13.583 --> 07:16.542
and, apparently,
if you're going to get lymphoma,

07:16.625 --> 07:18.458
that's the kind you want.

07:18.542 --> 07:20.458
Hey, you want to
hold it down up there, kids?

07:20.542 --> 07:23.917
I'm trying to talk to your Aunt Lucy!
Thank you.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.333
Anyway, I know I said that
we would come and visit you this June,

07:27.417 --> 07:32.000
but I'll be a little woozy and bald
from the chemo so...

07:32.083 --> 07:36.542
Oh, thanks for understanding.
Oh, one more thing.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.583
Our insurance policy
has a really high deductible,

07:39.667 --> 07:41.625
so we are strapped financially,

07:41.709 --> 07:46.166
and I was wondering if maybe
you and Dave might be able to...

07:46.250 --> 07:47.667
Oh, really?

07:51.417 --> 07:53.417
No, I am not asking Mom.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.917
She doesn't know about any of this,
so don't you tell her, okay?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.458
We'll be fine. I love you. Bye.

07:59.542 --> 08:02.041
I take it that's a no on the loan.

08:02.125 --> 08:05.166
Yep, Dave lost his job at the plant,

08:05.250 --> 08:08.834
and he is now handing out fliers
at a chicken restaurant,

08:08.917 --> 08:12.917
and prepare to wince,
there is a chicken suit involved.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.250
Ouch.

08:17.166 --> 08:19.875
So, where are we gonna find
this $10,000?

08:19.959 --> 08:23.542
You leave that to me.
I want you to focus on getting better.

08:23.625 --> 08:25.709
- But, honey...
- I will find it.

08:25.792 --> 08:28.625
Meanwhile, we'll make
some sacrifices around here.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.667
My tennis club membership
is up this month.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.291
I'm not renewing.

08:34.375 --> 08:37.875
Should you even be playing tennis
after your back surgery?

08:37.959 --> 08:39.333
Probably not.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.583
Well, in that spirit,

08:42.667 --> 08:46.125
as soon as I start chemo,
I will be giving up shampoo.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.959
Okay, thanks.

08:51.041 --> 08:52.542
Taxi's here.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.041
Are you sure you're ready to go back?
We could wait another week.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.166
And miss Gabby's wedding?
No, I'll be fine.

09:03.166 --> 09:05.542
Is this the dress
you were thinking for the ceremony?

09:05.625 --> 09:07.375
- Yes.
- Oh, good.

09:07.458 --> 09:10.917
I'll fold it in tissue so
it doesn't wrinkle.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.250
Oh, darling. I don't deserve you.

09:13.333 --> 09:17.375
Oh, come on, we agreed,
no more tears.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.709
I'm so sorry
to be putting you through this.

09:20.792 --> 09:24.166
I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell
and never looked back.

09:24.250 --> 09:28.959
Stop. I'm going to raise this child
and love it as if it were my own.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.625
Now let's see a smile.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.291
Well, I'm glad you could join us, Milton.

09:45.375 --> 09:47.333
It's good to get to know you
before the wedding.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.959
Thank you. You know I must say,

09:49.041 --> 09:51.875
all these months I thought Victor
was exaggerating about you,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.375
but he hasn't done you justice.

09:53.458 --> 09:58.250
- You, my dear, are a flawless beauty.
- I'm hardly flawless.

09:58.333 --> 10:00.750
I'm sure I have a blemish
hidden away somewhere.

10:00.834 --> 10:05.792
- That's a search I would relish.
- She is way out of your league, Dad.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.792
Honey, he's a multimillionaire.
He runs my league.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.125
By the way, Victor,
I ran into Keith Perkinson last week.

10:13.208 --> 10:14.959
And how is
the venerable state chairman?

10:15.041 --> 10:16.166
Impressed with you.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.959
He liked the way
you ran your mayoral campaign.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.458
Said if you keep your numbers up,

10:19.542 --> 10:22.542
he might consider supporting you
in the next governor's race.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.959
Really?

10:29.583 --> 10:31.917
What's so funny?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.750
You gotta be kidding, right?
I mean, we just finished a campaign.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.667
You're not about
to put me through another one.

10:36.750 --> 10:40.375
- But I thought you loved campaigning.
- God, no. It's a complete snore.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.792
Pasting a smile on my face

10:41.875 --> 10:44.625
while you say the same speech
for the fiftieth time.

10:44.709 --> 10:47.083
But you were a natural.
People loved you.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.834
Well, the feeling wasn't mutual.

10:48.917 --> 10:52.375
You think I enjoyed sipping tea
with these frumpy matrons

10:52.458 --> 10:55.208
who wore loud poly-blend pantsuits?

10:55.291 --> 10:56.875
You know how many times
I just wanted to scream,

10:56.959 --> 11:00.125
"Vote for my husband,
you colour-blind cow!"

11:00.208 --> 11:01.625
I think you've discovered
something very important

11:01.709 --> 11:03.542
about democracy, my dear.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.333
The nation is full of fools
and everyone gets a vote.

11:06.417 --> 11:08.208
Well, they're not gonna get us again.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.625
I made nice with Fairview.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.792
I'm not about to suck up to
the whole damn state.

11:21.709 --> 11:23.542
What are you doing?

11:25.125 --> 11:28.792
Some guy out in Mount Pleasant's
got a cracked water heater.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.375
It's 3:00 in the morning.

11:33.458 --> 11:37.792
Well, I started advertising
as a 24-hour plumber.

11:37.875 --> 11:39.625
After midnight, I get triple time.

11:39.709 --> 11:42.208
Okay, well, that's crazy.
You can't work around the clock.

11:42.291 --> 11:43.417
It's not healthy.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.333
Well, this is the third night
I've worked this week.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.208
I'm fine so far.

11:47.291 --> 11:49.500
You've been sneaking out
while I've been asleep?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.625
What are you, a ninja plumber?

11:51.709 --> 11:54.834
It's just for a little while
to earn some extra money.

11:58.917 --> 12:00.875
Is this about the wedding?

12:02.041 --> 12:05.291
We agreed we want it to be nice.

12:05.375 --> 12:08.041
But we didn't agree on this.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.959
Maybe I can scale things back a bit.

12:11.041 --> 12:14.333
How? Have a ginger ale fountain?

12:14.417 --> 12:17.041
Make paper doves and hope it's windy?

12:17.125 --> 12:20.959
Okay, seriously,
you don't have to kill yourself.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.041
I could max out my credit card.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.500
Is that really how you want to
start our life together, in debt?

12:27.583 --> 12:29.917
No, I want to start out happy.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.083
But clearly you're upset,
and I don't know why.

12:36.959 --> 12:38.667
I'm not Ian.

12:38.750 --> 12:41.083
I can't afford
to move you into a mansion

12:41.166 --> 12:43.458
or fly you off to Paris.

12:43.542 --> 12:44.959
But I'll be damned if I don't give you

12:45.041 --> 12:47.917
the same dream wedding
he would have given you.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.917
I'll see you in the morning.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.583
I'm drawing a picture of a tree.

13:00.208 --> 13:04.000
Where the hell do you get off having
cancer and not telling me about it?

13:04.083 --> 13:05.250
Mom.

13:05.333 --> 13:08.125
How do you think
you could handle this without me?

13:08.208 --> 13:09.291
Stella?

13:09.375 --> 13:12.291
Oh, there's my Tommy-boy.
Come here.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.166
Oh, God.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.834
Oh, listen, be a love, will you, honey,
and get my bags from the cab.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.125
- Bags? She's staying?
- Yep.

13:22.208 --> 13:25.959
And do not tip the driver.
SOB wouldn't let me smoke.

13:30.625 --> 13:34.208
Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know
you opened a day-care centre.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.458
Hey, kids, Grandma's here.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.750
Okay, what did you tell them about me?

13:41.834 --> 13:44.542
It's been five years, Mom.
They don't remember you.

13:44.625 --> 13:47.250
Well, they'll remember me this time.
I brought presents.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.208
- Cool!
- Hey.

13:49.291 --> 13:53.959
For you, and you, and you.

13:54.041 --> 13:57.041
These are baby toys.
We're too old to play with these.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.375
Well, I'm too old to remember

13:58.458 --> 14:00.417
what the hell 6-year-olds
like to play with.

14:00.500 --> 14:04.417
- We're eight!
- What do I care?

14:04.500 --> 14:07.333
- Just say thank you.
- Thank you.

14:07.417 --> 14:11.625
Oh, who's the pretty thing?
Your girlfriend?

14:11.709 --> 14:14.709
- No! She's my sister!
- Oh.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.250
Is that Tom's little B-A-S-T-A...

14:19.333 --> 14:22.250
Okay, kids. Time to get your toys
and let's play upstairs.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.917
Come on, Penny. Come on, sweetie.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.875
Let's go, everybody.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.291
Listen, Mom,
I really appreciate you coming to help,

14:33.375 --> 14:36.291
but as you can see, I'm perfectly fine.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.542
For now.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.500
How are you gonna handle that mob

14:39.583 --> 14:42.125
when you're flat on your ass
from chemo?

14:42.208 --> 14:43.500
I'll manage.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.709
You got through breast cancer
while raising the three of us alone.

14:47.792 --> 14:51.041
I was not alone. I had you.

14:51.125 --> 14:55.083
Lynette was all of 13,
and she still looked after her sisters,

14:55.166 --> 14:56.709
cleaned the house, cooked the meals,

14:56.792 --> 14:59.625
and I was curled up in a ball
puking my guts out.

14:59.709 --> 15:03.417
Well, that's what you get when
you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.

15:04.917 --> 15:08.709
You can goad me all you like, Lynette.
I did not come here to fight.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.375
Now trust me, cookie,

15:11.458 --> 15:14.333
I have memorised
a whole catalogue of subjects

15:14.417 --> 15:16.417
you and I can no longer discuss.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.333
And if that means that we have to talk
about the weather for three months,

15:20.417 --> 15:21.834
then fine.

15:21.917 --> 15:24.583
But I am staying.

15:24.667 --> 15:29.625
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go kick a child out of its room.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.208
Okay, legs up.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.375
Oh, you want to do it again?

15:45.458 --> 15:49.917
No. I've been doing a lot of research,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.834
and gravity helps facilitate
the sperm reaching the eggs.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.959
So heave-ho.

15:56.041 --> 15:58.917
Oh, well, could we try
a little light spooning

15:59.000 --> 16:01.375
before you hang me up
like a side of beef?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.375
Edie, we're trying to have a baby.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.583
Well, could we be a little less clinical?

16:05.667 --> 16:08.917
Maybe let nature take its course?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.959
Nature is not on our side any more.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.792
Look you're no spring chicken

16:14.875 --> 16:16.458
and those eggs
aren't exactly farm fresh.

16:16.542 --> 16:20.208
Okay, stop referring to me as poultry!

16:20.291 --> 16:23.417
Sorry. Can we just try this?
It's only for 30 minutes.

16:23.500 --> 16:26.458
Thirty minutes! I am not staying
in this position for half an hour!

16:26.542 --> 16:30.166
Listen, I know
that this requires some work,

16:30.250 --> 16:35.000
but it will all be worth it when we have
our beautiful, beautiful baby, right?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.917
Right.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.959
I guess I could make some sacrifices.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.792
That's my girl.

16:49.375 --> 16:52.875
- Can I get you anything?
- Yeah, I'd kill for a beer.

16:52.959 --> 16:56.041
- Sorry. No alcohol.
- What? For how long?

16:56.125 --> 16:59.417
Just until the baby's born.
Oh, and you stop nursing.

17:00.542 --> 17:03.166
Don't worry,
I'll get you a nice herbal tea.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.542
It's just for a few months,
while you're in treatment.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.208
We're gonna have to find someone
to watch the kids.

17:12.291 --> 17:15.709
No! I am not leaving that woman
in charge of our children.

17:15.792 --> 17:18.291
In three months,
the twins will be chain-smoking

17:18.375 --> 17:20.500
and Penny will be an alcoholic.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.083
We can manage.
We've got McCluskey.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.208
She costs money,
money that we won't have

17:25.291 --> 17:27.208
if we're paying someone
to replace you at work.

17:27.291 --> 17:30.291
You said not to worry about money,
that you'd find it somewhere.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.500
I did.

17:32.583 --> 17:36.166
- What? Someone loaned us $10,000?
- No, gave us.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.667
And we can't thank her
by kicking her out.

17:39.792 --> 17:43.375
No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother!

17:43.458 --> 17:46.625
Didn't have to. She knew that
you hit up Lucy, so she offered.

17:46.709 --> 17:50.000
- Well, we're giving it back.
- No, we can't afford to.

17:50.083 --> 17:54.291
Tom, you don't know
half the stuff she did to us.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.583
She would get drunk
and smack us around.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.291
She would meet some new guy,

17:59.375 --> 18:02.333
and then drop us off at her sister's
for a week because he wasn't into kids.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.458
Okay, so she was a crappy mom.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.500
You said yourself
that she has mellowed.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.458
Now she wants to make amends.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.375
If you would just try to understand.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.750
I think that I've been
pretty understanding lately.

18:13.834 --> 18:17.917
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I think you know.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.125
Great, so in the middle of everything
I'm dealing with,

18:20.208 --> 18:21.750
you're gonna throw Rick in my face?

18:21.834 --> 18:25.000
When someone we love hurts us,
if we still love them,

18:25.083 --> 18:27.500
we deal with it and we move on.

18:28.750 --> 18:31.333
If I can do it, so can you.

18:32.917 --> 18:36.667
So forgiving my mother,
that's my penance?

18:38.041 --> 18:40.125
Yeah. I think it is.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.250
I thought you said
we weren't supposed to spend

18:55.333 --> 18:56.834
the night before the wedding together.

18:56.917 --> 19:01.667
Yeah, I was trying to respect tradition,
but I got horny.

19:04.166 --> 19:05.417
Wow.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.417
Well, I guess we'll just have to start
the honeymoon early, won't we?

19:08.500 --> 19:10.417
Let me get rid of this stuff.

19:10.500 --> 19:13.458
- What are you working on so late?
- Nothing.

19:15.375 --> 19:18.542
Polling data? Why are you polling?
The election's over.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.959
It's just a little research.
God, you look hot.

19:21.041 --> 19:22.500
Is this about running for governor?

19:22.583 --> 19:25.125
Because I told you
how I feel about that.

19:25.208 --> 19:28.208
My dad just set up
a little exploratory committee.

19:28.291 --> 19:31.583
- It's no big deal.
- Oh, okay, well, let's explore it now.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.041
- Nope. Not gonna happen.
- Gabby.

19:34.125 --> 19:38.083
Victor, ever since we met,
it's been photo ops and fundraisers.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.458
- And I'm sick of it!
- Well, I'm a politician.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.041
Do you think I want my career
to begin and end in the suburbs?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.166
Fairview is my home,
and I don't wanna leave it.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.667
And you can't make this decision
without me.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.500
- I'm gonna be your wife.
- Exactly, not my career advisor.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.709
- Oh, so I don't even get a vote?
- Not if it's a veto.

19:51.792 --> 19:55.375
Okay, look, no! I already married a man
who put his career before me,

19:55.458 --> 19:57.208
and I swore I wasn't gonna do it again.

19:57.291 --> 20:00.792
Well, I swore I would not let
a stupid woman hold me back.

20:06.208 --> 20:09.333
That did not come out
the way I wanted it to.

20:10.750 --> 20:13.750
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

20:13.834 --> 20:15.625
I've just been under
a lot of pressure lately.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.583
Well, here's one less thing
you have to worry about,

20:18.667 --> 20:20.166
our wedding.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.333
You can't cancel the wedding.
It's too late.

20:23.417 --> 20:26.542
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just in the nick of time.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.250
Good morning, Gabby.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.083
God, Milton,
the newspaper's not even here yet.

20:43.166 --> 20:47.125
I'm sorry it's so early.
I just came to apologise.

20:47.208 --> 20:50.458
Why?
What happened wasn't your fault.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.250
That's not exactly the case.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.333
Is that coffee I smell?

20:59.000 --> 21:02.125
You only bolted
because Victor wants to be governor.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.500
He only wants to be governor
because of me.

21:04.583 --> 21:05.792
You only suggested it.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.375
You can't make him go after something
he doesn't want.

21:08.458 --> 21:10.709
The hell I can't.

21:10.792 --> 21:13.208
Ever since he was a kid,
Victor's been killing himself

21:13.291 --> 21:16.208
trying to live up to his big-shot father.

21:16.291 --> 21:20.250
- He's desperate for my approval.
- Why?

21:20.333 --> 21:23.166
I suppose because he's never gotten it.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.250
Everything he does,
even becoming mayor,

21:25.333 --> 21:28.250
I somehow let him know
that it's not quite enough.

21:29.125 --> 21:31.792
Oh, don't get me wrong,

21:31.875 --> 21:35.542
I'm right to push.
That's why he's so successful.

21:35.625 --> 21:36.834
So, what are you saying,

21:36.917 --> 21:39.583
I should marry Victor
because you're a withholding father?

21:39.667 --> 21:43.250
No, I just want you to understand
why he does what he does.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.375
Fine. I get it.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.709
But why would I want a husband

21:47.792 --> 21:51.041
who values his father's opinion
more than mine?

21:51.125 --> 21:54.500
Well, he doesn't really care much
what I think any more.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.750
After you left last night,
he called me and...

21:56.834 --> 22:00.333
What's the phrase?
Tore me a new one.

22:00.417 --> 22:03.333
- He did?
- He said because of me,

22:03.417 --> 22:06.125
he'd lost the best thing
that had ever happened to him.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.834
And if he couldn't win you back,

22:07.917 --> 22:11.166
I could take my money
and buy a new son

22:11.250 --> 22:14.542
because I was never gonna
be hearing from him again.

22:15.917 --> 22:17.917
He blew off $80 million?

22:20.083 --> 22:21.875
Well, if he cares about me
so damn much,

22:21.959 --> 22:24.250
why am I not hearing this from him?

22:25.458 --> 22:27.458
I think you're about to.

22:33.125 --> 22:35.458
Is there a back way out of here?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.041
Aren't you gonna be late
for Gabby's wedding?

22:55.125 --> 22:57.250
Oh, weddings are boring.

22:57.333 --> 22:59.834
I like to sneak in at the end,
look teary-eyed

22:59.917 --> 23:02.125
and pretend I was there the whole time.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.667
I am gonna see you at the reception.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.750
Oh, hi, Danny.

23:10.125 --> 23:14.000
Carlos, the paperboy's here!
Could you pay him? Come on in.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.792
Hey. Here you go, Danny.

23:22.625 --> 23:25.750
Oh, looks like I'm a little short.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.792
- Can I catch you later?
- No.

23:30.291 --> 23:32.125
All right, hold on.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.375
Oh, my God.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.834
What's that?

23:50.667 --> 23:52.542
It's birth control pills.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.583
I'm gonna need cash.

23:58.208 --> 24:01.250
- Welcome home.
- I have missed you, sweetheart.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.875
Here, allow me.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.542
Well, hello there, Julie.

24:09.542 --> 24:13.000
- You guys are back.
- Wow, somebody's blonder.

24:13.083 --> 24:16.166
Oh, yeah, my mom hates it, too.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.667
So where's Danielle?

24:18.750 --> 24:22.125
Well, while we were in Switzerland,
she ran across this boarding school.

24:22.208 --> 24:23.875
And she fell in love with it

24:23.959 --> 24:27.875
and just insisted that
we let her spend a year abroad.

24:27.959 --> 24:30.500
Wow. She must be having
a really good time.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.625
She hasn't returned
any of my phone calls.

24:32.709 --> 24:35.709
Oh, well, you know,
her school's up in the mountains

24:35.792 --> 24:39.291
and her cell phone reception
is kind of funky.

24:39.375 --> 24:42.208
She hasn't answered
my e-mails, either.

24:42.291 --> 24:43.625
Well, I am gonna call her tonight

24:43.709 --> 24:45.792
and have a little talk with her
about common courtesy,

24:45.875 --> 24:50.291
and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail
first thing tomorrow morning.

24:50.375 --> 24:51.542
Well, we should go.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.667
I've gotta get that bracelet to Gabby
before the wedding.

24:53.750 --> 24:56.000
Well, I'll see you guys there. Bye.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.458
- Well, that was uncomfortable.
- You have no idea.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.667
Everyone's been asking questions.

25:04.750 --> 25:07.208
This might not be
as easy as we'd hoped.

25:18.333 --> 25:21.000
There. Now you have something new.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.750
So, how do I look?

25:23.834 --> 25:28.125
You are now, officially,
the most beautiful bride that ever lived.

25:28.208 --> 25:32.208
- Until your wedding, of course.
- Nice save.

25:32.291 --> 25:36.166
It means so much to me that
we're all here together right now.

25:40.375 --> 25:41.750
And break!

25:44.125 --> 25:45.500
Love you.

25:57.041 --> 25:59.000
We are gathered here today

25:59.083 --> 26:03.291
to join together Victor Lang
and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony,

26:03.375 --> 26:06.208
an honourable estate
not to be entered into lightly,

26:06.291 --> 26:08.834
but reverently and soberly.

26:08.917 --> 26:13.709
This is a lifetime union,
one based on love, honour and trust.

26:13.792 --> 26:17.375
You wanna be my new best friend?
Premium scotch. Keep it coming.

26:18.625 --> 26:20.750
You are promising
not only to give of yourself,

26:20.834 --> 26:23.041
but also to accept each other,

26:23.125 --> 26:27.375
promising not only to love for today,
but to extend that love to include...

26:27.458 --> 26:29.542
Carlos! I thought you weren't coming
until after...

26:29.625 --> 26:30.709
Save it.

26:30.792 --> 26:33.500
If anyone can show just cause
why these two should not be joined...

26:33.583 --> 26:36.250
- Okay, look, I can explain.
- Don't bother.

26:37.834 --> 26:41.041
Your lies were more convincing
when I cared.

26:41.750 --> 26:44.291
Victor, do you take Gabrielle
to be your lawful wedded wife?

26:44.375 --> 26:46.500
- Carlos!
- In good times and in bad...

26:46.583 --> 26:48.375
You've got to understand.

26:48.458 --> 26:52.000
I do want to have a baby with you,
just not yet.

26:52.083 --> 26:56.291
I just... I wanted to give you a chance
to fall in love with me first.

26:56.375 --> 26:59.000
I don't believe you,
and I will never trust you again.

26:59.083 --> 27:02.917
Well, what was I supposed to do?
You backed me into a corner!

27:03.000 --> 27:08.083
You were gonna bail on us and
I was just trying to save what we had!

27:08.166 --> 27:10.166
Carlos, don't leave me!

27:11.959 --> 27:15.375
- Please just talk to me.
- I am done with you.

27:16.667 --> 27:18.083
Carlos!

27:19.291 --> 27:23.750
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you,
Mr and Mrs Victor Lang!

27:23.834 --> 27:25.333
I'm sorry!

27:37.667 --> 27:41.709
- Mrs McCluskey. Enjoy the wedding?
- Nice. Very classy.

27:41.792 --> 27:45.500
Although, what the hell was that
brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?

27:45.583 --> 27:47.291
I don't know and I don't care.

27:47.375 --> 27:51.291
Today I'm so filled with love,
I can forgive anyone anything.

27:51.375 --> 27:55.625
Oh, but if you do see them again,
call security.

27:55.709 --> 27:56.875
So we're in Zurich

27:56.959 --> 28:00.000
and I am sick after breakfast
for the third morning in a row.

28:00.083 --> 28:02.041
And I thought to myself, "Dear God,

28:02.125 --> 28:05.166
"I hope I have not developed
an allergy to chocolate brioche.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.125
"Life just wouldn't be worth living."

28:08.208 --> 28:10.959
So I said,
"That's it. We're seeing a doctor."

28:11.041 --> 28:13.083
Well, you could've
knocked us over with a feather

28:13.166 --> 28:15.375
when he said
she was already two months pregnant.

28:15.458 --> 28:18.875
Oh, I think it's so great,
and we could not be happier for you.

28:18.959 --> 28:21.208
- When's your due date?
- Oh, not until the early fall.

28:21.291 --> 28:23.875
But enough about me.
This is your day. You and Victor.

28:23.959 --> 28:27.375
- Who, by the way, I have not met yet.
- Oh, my gosh. That's right.

28:27.458 --> 28:30.000
Okay, you stay here.
I'm gonna go grab him.

28:32.417 --> 28:36.667
It is so good to be back.
I can't believe how much is happening.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.250
I mean, you and Gabby
getting married,

28:39.333 --> 28:41.417
and I'm having a baby.

28:41.500 --> 28:44.166
What's going on with you, Lynette?

28:44.250 --> 28:47.166
Nothing. Same old, same old.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.709
Really? Is everything okay, sweetie?

28:48.792 --> 28:52.375
'Cause you haven't quite seemed
yourself the last couple of weeks.

28:52.458 --> 28:54.917
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.

28:57.542 --> 29:02.500
I'll tell you this much, I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when this day is over.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.959
Well, it was all worth it.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.750
Marrying Gabby is the smartest thing
you've ever done.

29:07.834 --> 29:09.291
With her bringing in the Latino vote,

29:09.375 --> 29:11.667
the governor's mansion
is as good as yours.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.959
Well, that's assuming
I can change her mind.

29:14.041 --> 29:16.834
I had to make certain concessions
just to get her down the aisle.

29:16.917 --> 29:19.834
You're the husband now.
The rules have changed.

29:19.917 --> 29:22.083
Be nice, buy her a few pretty things.

29:22.166 --> 29:25.667
Trust me,you'll be
able to tame that little spitfire.

29:25.750 --> 29:26.959
I'm not too worried.

29:27.041 --> 29:29.709
I've always been able
to manage my assets.

29:41.375 --> 29:43.083
Did you find him?

29:44.291 --> 29:47.000
No, I'm still looking,
but I'll let you know.

29:52.750 --> 29:57.458
Oh, movie's over,
and, may I add, amen.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.792
Go out and play. Go on. Out.

30:05.500 --> 30:09.125
They're just gonna go play guns.
Can I watch another movie?

30:09.208 --> 30:12.208
Lynette said one was the limit
and she'll be home soon.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.667
No, she won't.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.208
Whenever they go out to a party,

30:15.291 --> 30:17.417
they always come home
at least an hour later

30:17.500 --> 30:19.458
than they say they will.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.917
Aren't you an observant little monkey?

30:25.125 --> 30:27.583
Tell me, sweetie,

30:27.667 --> 30:31.667
would you know anything
about a man named Rick?

30:31.750 --> 30:33.959
Yeah, I know Rick.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.625
My daddy and Lynette
had a big fight about him.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.834
Really?

30:38.917 --> 30:42.709
Sounds like there's
maybe a little story there.

30:42.792 --> 30:47.041
If I tell you, could I watch
a really good grown-up movie?

30:49.250 --> 30:52.417
If it's a really good grown-up story.

30:55.667 --> 30:57.792
Hey, I got you some appetisers
to tide you over.

30:57.875 --> 31:00.000
We have mini quiches and beef satay

31:00.083 --> 31:02.750
and something called
Crystal Coast shrimp with grits,

31:02.834 --> 31:04.083
but it's mostly just grits

31:04.166 --> 31:07.166
'cause I ate all the shrimp
on my way over.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.417
Mike?

31:22.208 --> 31:24.959
Reverend, that was
such a beautiful ceremony.

31:25.041 --> 31:28.208
Really just heartfelt and moving,
the whole package.

31:28.291 --> 31:31.375
- Why, thank you.
- Yeah, it was really impressive.

31:31.458 --> 31:33.917
So, what are you doing tonight?

31:42.583 --> 31:46.041
Oh, Carlos.
I didn't know you were in here.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.083
I got a little thirsty.

31:48.166 --> 31:50.667
Yes, I can see that.

31:52.583 --> 31:55.583
Gabby, I am sorry
if I ruined your wedding.

31:57.792 --> 32:01.000
But if it's any consolation,
I also ruined my life.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.041
What are you talking about?

32:05.125 --> 32:08.250
A couple of years ago,
I was totally happy.

32:08.333 --> 32:11.250
I had a home, you, great career.

32:13.041 --> 32:16.208
And I don't understand
how I let it all go to hell.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.458
And now, here I am,
back at square one.

32:23.125 --> 32:24.917
I really blew it.

32:29.417 --> 32:31.875
What am I doing?

32:31.959 --> 32:35.250
I shouldn't be dumping this on you.
It's your wedding day.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.917
Go to Victor.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.500
I'm going to stay right here...

32:49.417 --> 32:51.625
Well, I don't know how you did it.

32:51.709 --> 32:55.208
The kids are asleep and
the cough syrup hasn't been touched.

32:55.291 --> 32:59.208
Boy, you're just waiting for an excuse
to give me the boot.

32:59.291 --> 33:02.875
Well, if history's any indicator,
I won't have to wait long.

33:04.291 --> 33:07.458
So you don't think people can change?

33:09.083 --> 33:12.875
I think, at a certain point,
people just are who they are.

33:13.917 --> 33:17.083
Well, I think people can change.

33:17.166 --> 33:18.834
Now take you.

33:18.917 --> 33:21.875
You were the perfect wife and mom.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.041
Then along came Rick.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.583
- How did you...
- Come on, Lynette.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.750
You kids were young
when I was sneaking around on Glen,

33:31.834 --> 33:34.125
but you knew something was up.

33:35.375 --> 33:38.792
- You heard about this from my kids?
- Just the girl.

33:38.875 --> 33:40.709
And all she knows is that,

33:40.792 --> 33:43.709
"Daddy got mad
because Rick liked you."

33:46.417 --> 33:49.291
Nothing happened
between me and Rick.

33:49.375 --> 33:53.834
Yes, he came on to me,
but, unlike you, I controlled myself.

33:53.917 --> 33:56.417
Well, you had Tom to come home to.

33:58.041 --> 33:59.792
I had your stepfather.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.458
Hey, Glen may have bored you,

34:01.542 --> 34:04.583
but the years we had a father in
that house were the happiest of my life.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.583
You didn't care
about that though, did you?

34:06.667 --> 34:08.500
You just drove him away.

34:08.583 --> 34:12.166
And you couldn't wait to pay me back!

34:13.166 --> 34:17.333
Do you remember what you said
the next year when I got sick?

34:17.417 --> 34:19.834
- No, I don't.
- Liar.

34:21.500 --> 34:23.375
You said I earned it.

34:24.166 --> 34:26.208
It was God's punishment.

34:27.834 --> 34:30.333
How are you feeling now, Lynette?

34:31.375 --> 34:33.792
You think you're being punished?

34:35.458 --> 34:37.542
How can you say that?

34:37.625 --> 34:40.542
You were so sanctimonious.

34:40.625 --> 34:44.709
You could not imagine what sort
of woman could do that kind of thing.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.250
Not so hard to imagine now, is it?

34:47.333 --> 34:51.125
Stop comparing us.
I never did what you did.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.417
No, you just wanted to.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.208
You're leaving tomorrow.
I don't want your money.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.667
- I don't want you in my house.
- Hey!

35:01.750 --> 35:03.709
You are sick, Lynette.

35:04.625 --> 35:09.250
You think you know what you're in for
'cause you watched me go through it?

35:09.333 --> 35:11.750
Watching it is nothing.

35:11.834 --> 35:15.000
You are going to feel worse than
you thought a person could feel,

35:15.083 --> 35:19.458
and I'll be holding your hand
through every damn minute.

35:21.625 --> 35:24.750
You can't stay if I don't want you here.

35:24.834 --> 35:28.208
You can fight me
or you can fight the cancer.

35:28.291 --> 35:31.750
Trust me, you won't have
the strength to do both.

35:46.208 --> 35:50.583
Andrew, do young people
still say "awesome"?

35:50.667 --> 35:54.125
Not so much. Try "off the hook."

35:54.208 --> 35:56.500
"Off the hook"?
That doesn't even make sense.

35:56.583 --> 35:59.333
Fine. Type in "groovy." See if I care.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.625
Hello. Hodge residence.

36:06.709 --> 36:08.166
Oh, hi, Danielle.

36:08.250 --> 36:11.166
Listen, I am sending Julie Mayer
an e-mail from you.

36:11.250 --> 36:15.166
Now would you say that your school
was quote, off the hook, unquote?

36:15.250 --> 36:20.917
No. I would say it was "sucky,"
or "crappy," or "a freaking nightmare."

36:21.000 --> 36:23.834
Look, if you're gonna start complaining,
I'm gonna hang up.

36:23.917 --> 36:26.208
Mom, you have got to talk to the nuns.

36:26.291 --> 36:29.417
They are so harsh with me.
And they have all these stupid rules.

36:29.500 --> 36:31.834
Well, perhaps if some of those rules
had been in place

36:31.917 --> 36:35.625
when you took up with Edie's nephew,
you might not be in this little pickle.

36:35.709 --> 36:38.291
Mom, please, I just want to come home.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.792
<i>Look, I am gonna say this</i>
<i>one last time.</i>

36:40.875 --> 36:44.417
You are gonna stay put
until that baby is born.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.542
Now don't forget,
we're driving up this weekend

36:46.625 --> 36:50.166
and I am bringing your favourite,
lemon squares. And...

36:52.750 --> 36:56.917
- Darling, can I draw you a bath?
- That would be lovely.

37:00.709 --> 37:03.166
Oh, would you give me a hand, please?

37:07.375 --> 37:08.834
There you go.

37:12.583 --> 37:16.542
- It's almost time for the six-month size.
- Oh, don't remind me.

37:21.041 --> 37:24.291
No. No, it's no problem.
I can fix that for you.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.625
Just give me your name and address.

37:26.709 --> 37:30.709
<i>I'm Mrs Emmeline Walcott</i>
<i>and I'm at 42 Old Mill Road.</i>

37:30.792 --> 37:33.625
All right. I've gotta stop
and pick up a Douglas valve,

37:33.709 --> 37:36.750
but I should be there
in 45 minutes tops.

37:40.166 --> 37:43.250
I hate to see you drive
when you're this tired.

37:43.333 --> 37:47.667
There's some iced coffee in the fridge.
I'll be fine.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.417
See you when I get back.

37:58.417 --> 38:00.875
- You were great.
- Did y'all ever doubt I would be?

38:00.959 --> 38:03.291
Just hurry up and get dressed.
We only have 45 minutes.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.542
Okay.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.709
- Are you Mike?
- Yeah.

38:21.792 --> 38:24.166
I'm looking for a Mrs Walcott's house.

38:24.250 --> 38:27.500
You've come to the right place.
Here, put this on.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.417
You mind telling me
what Susan's up to?

38:37.500 --> 38:39.208
Ask her yourself.

38:56.166 --> 38:57.375
Hello.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.750
Are you sure about this?

39:01.834 --> 39:06.417
I don't want you to look back and
regret not having your perfect wedding.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.083
Well, I don't know if you've noticed,

39:08.166 --> 39:11.291
but my idea of the perfect wedding
keeps changing.

39:12.875 --> 39:17.083
One day I want white roses
and then I want lilies.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.417
First I want a harpist
and then a string quartet.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.667
Only one thing stays constant,

39:24.750 --> 39:26.750
and I'm looking at him.

39:30.667 --> 39:34.417
Why would I need anything else
to make my wedding perfect?

39:37.834 --> 39:41.250
Well, who knew downsizing
could be so romantic?

39:43.208 --> 39:44.375
Yeah.

39:44.458 --> 39:47.667
- Mrs Walcott, I presume?
- That's right, sugar.

39:50.375 --> 39:53.834
Oh, you might wanna check
that breast pocket of your suit.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.750
Just so you know,
you'll be paying for those

40:02.834 --> 40:05.333
and the lights and the flowers.

40:08.291 --> 40:11.083
God, I've never seen you
look so beautiful.

40:12.875 --> 40:15.375
You clean up pretty good yourself.

40:25.417 --> 40:26.917
Are we ready?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.333
Are you kidding? They've been
dragging this thing out for three years.

40:36.542 --> 40:39.625
We are gathered here today
to join together

40:39.709 --> 40:43.083
Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer
in matrimony,

40:43.166 --> 40:46.125
an honourable estate
not to be entered into lightly,

40:46.208 --> 40:48.750
but reverently and soberly.

40:52.709 --> 40:56.667
<i>Family,</i>
<i>there is nothing more important.</i>

40:58.834 --> 41:02.333
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>who show up when we're in trouble.</i>

41:04.375 --> 41:07.000
<i>The ones who push us to succeed.</i>

41:10.375 --> 41:13.875
<i>The ones who help keep our secrets.</i>

41:17.834 --> 41:21.333
<i>But what of those</i>
<i>who have no family to rely on?</i>

41:25.250 --> 41:27.834
<i>What happens to those poor souls</i>

41:30.083 --> 41:33.875
<i>who have no loved ones</i>
<i>to help them in their hour of need?</i>

41:35.667 --> 41:41.166
<i>Well, most learn</i>
<i>to walk life's road by themselves.</i>

41:44.250 --> 41:46.291
<i>But a sad few of us</i>

41:50.125 --> 41:53.083
<i>simply stop trying.</i>
