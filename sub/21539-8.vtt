00:06.039 --> 00:07.507
Emilia...

00:07.540 --> 00:08.541
will you marry me?

00:08.575 --> 00:09.576
Yes.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.178
Oh, my God!

00:12.212 --> 00:14.247
We have an offer: 3.75.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.650
I hate to back up
such good news with bad news.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.252
We did take
a full-price offer,

00:19.285 --> 00:21.021
and we're gonna execute
that contract.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.626
Look at the view.
The view is everything.

00:26.659 --> 00:27.627
(Fredrik)
Perfection.

00:27.660 --> 00:30.196
[speaking Swedish]

00:30.230 --> 00:32.799
We have told you that we've
been planning to have kids.

00:32.832 --> 00:33.800
(Klas)
Where are you now?

00:33.833 --> 00:34.968
Have you found a mother?

00:35.001 --> 00:36.169
The one that I'm at least

00:36.202 --> 00:38.238
putting a lot of my hopes in
is Anna.

00:38.271 --> 00:39.706
- Nice to see you.
- Hey.

00:39.739 --> 00:40.707
- Hey.
- Hey, Fredrik.

00:40.740 --> 00:44.177
[all speaking Swedish]

00:44.210 --> 00:45.445
- Boyfriend?
- Yeah.

00:45.478 --> 00:46.746
It just happened.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.018
[upbeat music]

00:52.052 --> 00:54.087
(Ryan)
My motto is expansion,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.123
always in all ways.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.693
(Luis)
New York City,
it's the most exciting city

00:59.726 --> 01:01.628
for real estate,
and that's why I'm here.

01:01.661 --> 01:03.963
(Fredrik)
I'm the closer
and a listing machine.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.566
What makes me better is that
I work harder than anyone else.

01:06.599 --> 01:07.634
Whee!

01:07.667 --> 01:09.469
We're friends now,
right?

01:09.502 --> 01:11.838
I don't need him,
and you don't either.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.640
This will never end.

01:30.857 --> 01:31.825
Boyfriend?

01:31.858 --> 01:33.093
- Yeah.
- Brand-new?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.094
Yes.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.295
I didn't know.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.429
I mean, I guess I have
to call you more often.

01:36.463 --> 01:37.897
- I mean...
- Yes, you should.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.699
(Fredrik)
One of the reasons
I'm in Sweden

01:39.733 --> 01:41.634
is for Derek and me
to ask Anna

01:41.668 --> 01:43.636
to reconsider
giving her eggs to us.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.871
That's good.

01:44.904 --> 01:46.773
That's really good.
I'm really happy.

01:46.806 --> 01:49.142
This changes everything.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.543
We want to see Derek too.
What's he doing?

01:50.577 --> 01:51.745
Yeah, come and say hi
to Derek.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.146
- Okay.
- Babe?

01:53.179 --> 01:54.180
(Fredrik and Anna)
Derek.

01:54.214 --> 01:55.181
- Anna's boyfriend.
- Hi.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.017
Oh, hi.
Give me a second.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.118
What did we miss?

01:58.118 --> 01:59.552
How long have you
been here?

01:59.586 --> 02:00.653
Um, not so long.

02:00.687 --> 02:01.921
We just arrived
from Stockholm.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.922
My family says hi.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.057
- Sigge, Malin.
- Aw.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.592
I met my father.
Derek was there.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.060
It was great, you know.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.161
We'll talk about it later.

02:08.194 --> 02:09.162
Hey, how's it going?

02:09.195 --> 02:10.263
Hey!

02:10.296 --> 02:11.264
Aw.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.265
Nice to see you.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.266
How you been?

02:13.299 --> 02:14.434
This is David.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.802
Hi, David. Derek.
Nice to meet you.

02:15.835 --> 02:16.936
Nice to meet you.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.271
You guys look like
you're in love.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.572
You're smiling a lot.

02:19.606 --> 02:21.341
[laughter]
- Aw.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.876
Okay, so let's have
some champagne.

02:22.909 --> 02:24.110
Okay.
Do you not have a drink?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.746
- No, I want some.
- Here, have one.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.881
- Cheers.
- I love you.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.382
- I love you so much.
- Cheers, cheers.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.383
- And I love you too now.
- I love you too.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.451
Without knowing you,
I love you,

02:31.484 --> 02:32.552
because you love her.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.154
I love you too.

02:38.725 --> 02:39.793
Go and have fun.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.194
- Yeah.
- Go mingle.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.096
(Fredrik)
We came all the way
from New York here

02:43.096 --> 02:47.200
to ask this incredibly
important, personal question.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.536
So Derek and I are gonna
have to think

02:49.569 --> 02:52.272
long and hard over this.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.541
Who here is looking for a house
in Are?

02:54.574 --> 02:58.311
(Fredrik)
But I still have
a house to sell.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.447
Ooh, that's a problem,
'cause we only have one,

03:00.480 --> 03:01.648
and I saw five hands.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.183
[laughter]

03:11.057 --> 03:13.059
(Luis)
Ronita, talk to me.

03:16.629 --> 03:18.331
(Luis)
I'm not sure.

03:20.066 --> 03:21.067
Don't worry.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.135
When the time comes,

03:22.168 --> 03:23.970
when we find them,
we find them, okay?

03:24.070 --> 03:25.472
I'm going to 90th Street now,

03:25.505 --> 03:27.907
and I will call you as soon
as I'm done with this pitch.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.644
The Upper East Side is, to me,

03:31.678 --> 03:34.447
one of the most
sophisticated, elegant,

03:34.481 --> 03:37.584
and prestigious neighborhoods
in Manhattan.

03:37.617 --> 03:39.185
This part
of the Upper East Side,

03:39.219 --> 03:41.187
around 90th Street
and 2nd Avenue,

03:41.221 --> 03:43.556
it's mostly very young families.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.658
(Garin)
Hello, how are you?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.595
- Garin, good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.096
Garin Toren is an amazing guy.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.599
By 22, he made a fortune
on real estate

03:52.632 --> 03:53.967
as a developer in South Africa.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.368
Thanks for
stopping by so fast.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.103
That's really impressive.

03:57.103 --> 03:59.205
Garin and his family have been
here for about three years,

03:59.239 --> 04:00.907
and now they want
to move to Connecticut.

04:00.940 --> 04:02.509
We're gonna look
at all the suburbs

04:02.542 --> 04:04.044
that we think
might be attractive.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.046
All right,
so show me around.

04:06.046 --> 04:14.054
* *

04:22.662 --> 04:24.264
This apartment was previously
on the market

04:24.297 --> 04:26.266
with another broker
for about three months,

04:26.299 --> 04:27.967
but it did not sell,

04:28.068 --> 04:29.536
because they didn't call me.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.704
I'll show you outside.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.706
Outside is truly
one of a kind.

04:32.739 --> 04:37.711
* *

04:37.744 --> 04:39.846
Oh, my God!

04:39.879 --> 04:41.514
The whole roof.

04:41.548 --> 04:46.219
It's quite nice to have
270-degree views.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.688
Garin did a great job renovating
the entire apartment.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.327
Except for one thing.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.098
The golden shower.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.034
[whimsical music]

05:01.067 --> 05:04.337
* *

05:04.371 --> 05:06.039
(Garin)
My wife loves this.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.107
(Luis)
Listen, whatever works.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.641
[laughter]

05:08.675 --> 05:10.877
I mean, do people
really like golden showers?

05:10.910 --> 05:12.512
I don't.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.080
[laughing]

05:19.586 --> 05:20.587
Look at this.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.322
Oh, my God, come on.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.057
The whole wall?

05:27.160 --> 05:30.263
(Luis)
I know that Garin's
last broker dropped the ball.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.565
How can you not sell
such a unique apartment

05:32.599 --> 05:34.434
with 4 bedrooms,
2 1/2 bathrooms,

05:34.467 --> 05:36.236
private terrace, triplex,

05:36.269 --> 05:37.871
in a penthouse floor

05:37.904 --> 05:40.907
for less than $3 million
on the Upper East Side?

05:40.940 --> 05:43.376
If we're gonna do this,
it's got to be done differently,

05:43.410 --> 05:44.944
otherwise we're just
gonna take it

05:44.978 --> 05:46.980
off the market permanently
and just stay here.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.115
When I looked at the listing
that you had on the market,

05:49.149 --> 05:51.951
it did not show this.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.722
The pictures were looking
towards the wall.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.590
Why not look at the view?

05:57.624 --> 06:01.428
This apartment sells itself.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.763
Am I gonna be dealing with you
or one of your assistants?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.565
You'll be dealing 100%
with me.

06:05.598 --> 06:07.167
I have no girlfriend.
I have no friends.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.035
I have no family
here in New York City.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.838
I dedicate my entire life
to my job.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.506
Wow, that's so sad.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.941
But listen, it's the truth.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.543
When I commit to something,

06:16.576 --> 06:18.144
I put my life behind it.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.814
We had it on the market
at 2.995.

06:20.847 --> 06:22.282
What do you think of the price?

06:22.315 --> 06:25.952
I think the price
is actually good.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.355
At 3 million, we're just shy
of $1,400 a foot,

06:28.388 --> 06:31.057
which is less than
the average in the neighborhood,

06:31.057 --> 06:32.826
around $1,500 a foot,

06:32.859 --> 06:35.595
not to mention that we have
a private rooftop.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.364
That is a steal.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.065
So 3 million,
we have a deal?

06:42.836 --> 06:44.838
Yeah, Luis.

06:44.871 --> 06:47.707
With the right presentation
and the right marketing,

06:47.741 --> 06:50.076
I am super confident
that this place will sell

06:50.076 --> 06:51.444
like there is no tomorrow.

06:51.478 --> 06:54.080
(Luis)
Garin, beautiful job
you've done here.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.889
Yuri, we're going
to 22 Renwick, please.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.493
Renwick is a tiny,
tiny little street

07:06.526 --> 07:09.295
all the way on the West Side
of Manhattan, Downtown,

07:09.329 --> 07:13.466
and the area was just rezoned
for residential use.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.735
And so people
are now developing.

07:17.504 --> 07:20.807
22 Renwick is one of several
new construction buildings

07:20.840 --> 07:24.277
that are totally transforming
this neighborhood.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.047
[elevator bell dings]

07:27.047 --> 07:28.048
Hello?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.049
(Michael)
Hey, Ryan.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.383
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.686
Quite the penthouse up here.

07:32.719 --> 07:33.920
Thank you very much.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.189
Olivia used to be my assistant,

07:36.222 --> 07:38.058
but she became an agent
on my team

07:38.058 --> 07:39.125
about six months ago.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.393
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:40.427 --> 07:43.129
She's the best broker,
next to me, of course.

07:43.163 --> 07:47.467
She's very good,
and why wouldn't she be?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.302
She learned from the best.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.437
(Ryan)
You want to show us around?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.706
- Yeah, sure.
- Let's do it.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.575
Right now the only two units
left at 22 Renwick

07:55.608 --> 07:58.211
are two penthouses.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.914
Penthouse one is a triplex

08:01.014 --> 08:03.483
with floor-to-ceiling windows
throughout.

08:03.516 --> 08:07.654
* *

08:07.687 --> 08:08.788
This is intense.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.023
Nice wood ceiling.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.658
(Olivia)
Very nice.

08:16.262 --> 08:18.031
This place is like a house.

08:18.031 --> 08:22.035
* *

08:22.035 --> 08:23.937
This is
a European stretch ceiling,

08:24.037 --> 08:26.506
so it kind of creates, like,
just a light glow.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.275
(Ryan)
This is beautiful.
This place is huge.

08:29.309 --> 08:32.345
This penthouse
is over 2,700 square feet

08:32.379 --> 08:34.214
of indoor space,

08:34.247 --> 08:36.616
but what makes it
truly incredible

08:36.649 --> 08:40.153
and really deserving
of being the top-top-top

08:40.186 --> 08:42.255
is the outdoor space.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.059
You've got four balconies.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.594
Wow.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.663
Plus, the entire
private roof deck

08:50.697 --> 08:53.066
has 360-degree views.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.568
These are the best views
in the house.

08:55.602 --> 08:57.904
You got the Freedom Tower
down there.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.206
(Ryan)
You can even see the tip
of the Empire State Building.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.408
This is beautiful.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.513
(Ryan)
Penthouse three,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.648
the other apartment
that we're pitching,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.250
is a single-floor unit

09:10.283 --> 09:12.786
that takes up
the entire ninth floor.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.354
Wow.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.257
(Ryan)
At just under 2,000 square feet,

09:17.290 --> 09:20.760
the apartment is 3 beds
with 2 1/2 baths

09:20.794 --> 09:24.664
and a measly two
awesome terraces.

09:24.698 --> 09:28.335
I really like this one.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.136
(Michael)
So this is an amazing
entertaining space

09:30.170 --> 09:31.137
for when you have guests.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.672
(Ryan)
Yeah.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.874
(Olivia)
It's nice that the floor plans
are so different.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.080
This is a great master.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.486
Let's talk about price.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.787
Let's do it.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.890
(Michael)
For the top floor,
penthouse one,

09:50.924 --> 09:54.594
the price we're looking for
is 6 1/2.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.363
(Ryan)
In a not-too-distant future,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.098
this is going to be one
of the most sought-after

09:58.131 --> 10:01.167
neighborhoods in the city...

10:01.201 --> 10:03.470
but it's not yet.

10:03.503 --> 10:06.439
I feel that penthouse one,
the big one upstairs,

10:06.473 --> 10:07.874
is worth $2,500 a foot.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.642
I just don't think
that someone is going to pay

10:09.676 --> 10:12.045
$2,500 a foot today.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.382
Savvy buyers recognize
areas of Manhattan

10:15.415 --> 10:17.884
that are "up and coming,"

10:17.917 --> 10:20.120
and that's really
what this location is.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.821
Buyers see
the investment opportunity

10:21.855 --> 10:24.724
if you give them the option
to buy low now.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.694
And in the next five, ten years,

10:27.727 --> 10:29.129
everybody who bought now

10:29.162 --> 10:30.797
will be the geniuses
who got in early.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.832
So you'd like to price it
at what number?

10:36.036 --> 10:37.270
Take it away, grasshopper.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.039
We've looked
at the comps,

10:39.072 --> 10:42.242
and you see the construction
outside the window.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.944
We're thinking more
around the lines of six.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.819
I'm not gonna price it
at 6 million.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.554
Absolutely not.

10:55.989 --> 11:00.226
I think I need it to be
at 6.35.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.263
If you guys can live with that,
I can move forward.

11:08.501 --> 11:09.502
I think we can meet there.

11:09.536 --> 11:12.305
Ryan?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.874
I mean, whatever she says goes.

11:14.908 --> 11:19.646
(Ryan)
At 6.35, we're just about
$2,350 a foot,

11:19.679 --> 11:21.748
which is just enough
of a discount

11:21.781 --> 11:23.149
to make it seem like a good deal

11:23.183 --> 11:27.187
compared to other luxury
properties in the neighborhood.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.722
(Ryan)
And then how much for this one?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.391
(Olivia)
That's it.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.093
Not a penny more.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.661
I agree with her.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.629
[Michael laughs]

11:36.663 --> 11:38.531
I'm glad you agree
with your boss.

11:38.565 --> 11:39.866
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

11:39.899 --> 11:40.967
- Thanks, Michael.
- Thank you.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.435
Congratulations
on your promotion.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.104
(Olivia)
Thank you.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.105
(Luis)
Coming up...

11:45.138 --> 11:46.606
Definitely a golden shower.

11:46.639 --> 11:48.775
Well, beside the gold,
it looks lovely.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.411
Oh, my...
[screaming]

11:51.444 --> 11:53.113
[laughter]
- Ah!

11:57.183 --> 12:00.153
[upbeat music]

12:00.186 --> 12:03.723
* *

12:03.757 --> 12:05.191
- Señor, how are you, man?
- Luis, how you doing?

12:05.225 --> 12:06.326
- Good to see you.
- Good.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.961
- Please, welcome, welcome.
- Thank you.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.863
So this is the place.
What do you think?

12:13.633 --> 12:15.602
Looks very nice.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.404
Presentation was a huge problem
for this listing

12:17.437 --> 12:20.807
when it was first introduced
to the market.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.809
The first thing I did
was bring my photographer

12:22.842 --> 12:24.577
to tell the story
of the apartment

12:24.611 --> 12:26.079
the way it needs to be told.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.283
I showed off the views.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.551
I showed off the lights.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.520
I showed off the layout.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.855
Obviously, the results
were amazing.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.426
And just like I thought,
boom, back-to-back showings.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.860
This apartment
feels like a home.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.430
The terrace is amazing.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.831
- Pleasure, pleasure.
- Thank you.

12:44.864 --> 12:45.899
- How are you, sir?
- Hi, Luis.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.300
Good to meet you.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.435
(Luis)
Richard Hamilton is a very,

12:48.468 --> 12:49.836
very well-known broker
in the city.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.137
I think he's been
in the business

12:51.171 --> 12:52.939
for about 20, 25 years.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.407
We have never done
a deal together,

12:54.441 --> 12:58.011
but I just have the feeling
that that's about to change.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.279
Is your client not coming?

12:59.312 --> 13:00.480
She wants me to preview.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.048
Well, listen,
I'm about to surprise you.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.216
She really wants this.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.551
Let me show you
this apartment.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.786
The kitchen is amazing,
'cause it's very open.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.588
It's very rare to find
an apartment

13:08.621 --> 13:10.724
on Upper East Side
at $3 million

13:10.757 --> 13:12.459
with a view like this
from the kitchen.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.960
(Richard)
She's gonna love the window.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.595
(Luis)
So this is the master bedroom.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.097
This is only
for the shoes.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.199
You got one, two, three.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.404
(Luis)
I always want
to accentuate the positive,

13:24.437 --> 13:26.973
but every apartment
has at least one drawback.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.843
And this one is no exception.

13:29.876 --> 13:33.613
[ominous music]

13:33.646 --> 13:34.614
Wow.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.615
(Luis)
Yes.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.917
It's gold.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.085
Yep.

13:42.088 --> 13:43.156
This is the master bathroom.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.491
In this case,
you can't ignore it.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.625
It's right there.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.294
Gold, gold, but amazing gold.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.662
You just have to deal with it.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.097
Definitely
a golden shower.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.101
She's beautiful.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.738
Actually, I think
she'll like this.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.206
It's got the Midas touch.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.309
I'll take it.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.712
Finally, someone that
can really appreciate.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.120
My customer doesn't usually
like to mess around,

14:14.154 --> 14:16.256
and neither do I.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.858
This is the antithesis
of what she's been seeing.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.860
I understand.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.495
But she's going to be
interested in this.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.930
Ah.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.598
I don't usually like
to admit this kind of thing,

14:25.632 --> 14:27.767
but I think it's well-priced.

14:27.801 --> 14:30.537
I have a very, very good feeling
about this guy.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.641
It doesn't happen.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.676
(Luis)
My kind of man, I love it.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.683
(Olivia)
Hey, Ryan.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.785
(Ryan)
What's going on?

14:45.819 --> 14:46.786
Yes.

14:46.820 --> 14:47.921
I just wanted to figure out

14:47.954 --> 14:49.122
who's doing what,
divvy up the work.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.790
I just wanted
to brainstorm.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.359
I want you to do everything.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.663
There's two penthouses.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.399
We have to split the work
somehow.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.101
In the interest of time,

15:01.134 --> 15:02.268
why don't we
divide and conquer?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.170
I will handle penthouse three

15:04.204 --> 15:06.506
if you can take on
penthouse one,

15:06.539 --> 15:07.507
which is the big one.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.808
That's crazy.
That's, like--

15:08.842 --> 15:11.911
I'm taking
the $6.35 million penthouse.

15:11.945 --> 15:13.079
Yes.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.582
Olivia is not at a point yet
in her career

15:15.615 --> 15:17.817
where she'd be able
to land a listing like this

15:17.851 --> 15:19.452
on her own.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.388
Wow, I am too good to you,
actually.

15:21.421 --> 15:25.158
In this case, I'll be there
to catch her if she falls.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.060
I'm just surprised.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.461
You can stage it
if you want to.

15:28.495 --> 15:29.462
You don't have to.

15:29.496 --> 15:30.463
We need to get photos done.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.564
We need to have a brokers event.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.900
So what happens
when I sell penthouse one

15:33.933 --> 15:35.635
and you don't sell
penthouse three?

15:35.669 --> 15:36.803
What?

15:39.072 --> 15:40.140
Are you serious right now?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.207
Let's see who
can get a buyer first.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.208
Whoa.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.209
Come on.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.244
So you want to make a bet?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.079
If I get a buyer
for penthouse one,

15:46.079 --> 15:47.313
you wear a bunny suit,

15:47.347 --> 15:49.315
and you can be my assistant
for an entire day.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.483
Have you been thinking
about this?

15:50.517 --> 15:53.219
Yes, since I started.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.587
What the f***?

15:54.621 --> 15:55.655
You love stuff like this.

15:55.689 --> 15:56.690
I don't love
wearing bunny suits.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.957
When have I ever
worn a bunny suit?

15:57.991 --> 16:00.360
- I don't wear bunny suits.
- I don't know.

16:03.763 --> 16:05.932
Okay, if I win,

16:06.032 --> 16:09.035
you will jump
into the Hudson River.

16:09.035 --> 16:10.637
Point of entry
is your choice.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.405
A woman's body
has the right to choose.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.541
Good?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.809
It's fine. People swim
in the Hudson all the time.

16:15.842 --> 16:16.810
I see people in there
all the time.

16:16.843 --> 16:17.911
What if I get sick?

16:17.944 --> 16:19.446
Penicillin is
a beautiful thing.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.115
Modern medicine,
we are in America.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.222
Come on.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.290
I'm going to be your assistant
for a day

16:30.323 --> 16:31.458
while wearing a bunny suit.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.459
Why do you want me to do that?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.460
'Cause it's funny.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.461
- Is it funny?
- Yeah.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.462
I don't think
it's that funny.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.197
I think
it's hilarious.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.365
Because you make me nervous.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.367
(Ryan)
I do do that, don't I?

16:40.400 --> 16:48.074
* *

16:48.074 --> 16:51.077
[dogs barking]

16:55.115 --> 16:56.249
- So--[gasps]
- Oh, I love them.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.717
- They're so cute.
- So many.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.456
(Fredrik)
After last night's party,

17:03.490 --> 17:06.026
I spent most of the day
doing private showings.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.294
And although I didn't
get any offers,

17:08.328 --> 17:11.498
I always felt that Helene
is my buyer.

17:11.531 --> 17:12.766
Have you ever dogsled?

17:12.799 --> 17:14.267
- No, I haven't, no.
- No.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.269
I think that's where
I need to get you,

17:16.302 --> 17:17.704
do some activities with you.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.740
[speaking Swedish]

17:23.043 --> 17:25.111
[barking loudly]

17:25.145 --> 17:26.446
[dogs barking]

17:26.479 --> 17:28.314
I always knew
that selling this house

17:28.348 --> 17:31.217
was about selling Are,
winter wonderland.

17:31.251 --> 17:35.288
And what better way to do that
than go dog sledding?

17:35.321 --> 17:36.456
[imitates whip cracking]

17:36.489 --> 17:37.791
[groans]

17:37.824 --> 17:40.794
- They're strong.
- Sh**.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.063
Sh**.

17:43.096 --> 17:46.433
Oh, my...
[screaming]

17:46.466 --> 17:47.534
F***!

17:47.567 --> 17:49.069
Ah!

17:53.106 --> 17:55.909
Whoa, sh**.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.177
[grunts]

17:57.210 --> 17:59.212
Helene, how are you doing?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.480
So beautiful.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.016
It's amazing!

18:03.016 --> 18:05.185
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

18:05.218 --> 18:07.287
[laughing]

18:21.301 --> 18:22.535
(Fredrik)
Oh, wow.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.037
Amazing!

18:24.037 --> 18:26.906
(Helene)
This is Are.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.475
Come, let's go out here.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.310
So peaceful.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.579
Tell me, what's in your heart?

18:43.556 --> 18:44.524
11.5?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.092
Yeah.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.396
(Fredrik)
It might not sound
like a big difference

18:49.429 --> 18:51.564
between 11.5 and 11.7,

18:51.598 --> 18:52.832
but for me, it's everything,

18:52.866 --> 18:55.068
because the developer
made crystal clear

18:55.101 --> 18:58.471
he will only take full ask
and nothing below.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.107
I can't come up with an offer
at 11.5.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.308
It's the last house.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.510
It's the best house,
the biggest plot.

19:03.543 --> 19:04.778
It's the most beautiful view.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.479
The lake, right here,
we're standing,

19:06.513 --> 19:07.647
and the mountain.

19:07.681 --> 19:09.649
You have everything,
it's everything you want.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.787
Standing there,
holding on...

19:13.820 --> 19:14.788
Yeah.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.190
Don't you think that
that is 11.7?

19:22.295 --> 19:24.030
- Little?
- Yes.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.266
I'm, like, three times
the size of you.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.901
Nice haircut,
by the way.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.270
[laughter]

19:30.303 --> 19:31.271
No, what are you doing?

19:31.304 --> 19:32.706
Oh, my God,
you're crazy.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.142
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

11.7.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.180
Honestly.

Oh, my God.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.467
So we have a deal?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.769
Honestly, I am so happy for you.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.937
I am happy.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.739
You know,
certain things in life,

20:05.772 --> 20:09.342
like this moment,
you can't put a price on it.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.213
Yeah.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.981
(Ryan)
Coming up...

20:15.015 --> 20:17.350
[gasps]

20:17.384 --> 20:20.086
Everything's gone.
Did you move it?

20:20.120 --> 20:21.488
When I saw you coming in,

20:21.521 --> 20:23.089
the first thing that crossed
my mind was,

20:23.123 --> 20:26.626
I'm not gonna be able to ask her
again for her eggs.

Garin, I got an offer for you.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.809
I know, it's very quick.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.711
(Luis)
I knew this was
a great apartment.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.980
It just needed
the Luis D. Ortiz touch.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.915
[magical tune]

20:48.948 --> 20:50.483
- How are you, sir?
- Hi, Luis.

20:50.517 --> 20:52.052
(Luis)
The day after I met
Richard Hamilton,

20:52.085 --> 20:54.054
he took his client
to see the apartment.

20:54.087 --> 20:58.258
First thing this morning,
he called me with an offer.

20:58.291 --> 20:59.459
It's an initial offer.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.760
It's low,

21:00.794 --> 21:02.429
but I know that there's
a lot of room to improve.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.065
It's 2.750.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.534
[Garin sighs]

21:13.173 --> 21:15.875
2.9 is the magic number
for Garin.

21:15.909 --> 21:17.911
We priced it at 2.995,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.479
but he authorized me,

21:19.512 --> 21:22.549
as long as I get 2.9 or higher,
we have a deal.

21:22.582 --> 21:23.616
[line trilling]

21:24.718 --> 21:25.685
Rich Hamilton.

21:25.719 --> 21:26.820
My seller wants to do a deal,

21:26.853 --> 21:27.854
but unfortunately
he doesn't want

21:27.887 --> 21:29.089
to move down
from his asking price.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.424
He wants to stay
right under 3 million.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.264
Beautiful.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.399
Okay, I like where
this is going.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.968
We're gonna make a deal at 2.9.

Rich, I'm transferring you now.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.213
Rich.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.521
(Luis)
If you get me 2.90,

22:01.554 --> 22:03.590
I think I can make you a deal.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.728
Okay.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.096
Just give me 2.9.

22:10.130 --> 22:11.464
Let's wrap this up.
Let's go home.

2.9.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.706
Sure, one second.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.474
Close the deal.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.909
Rich, talk to me.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.246
Ha!

22:26.279 --> 22:27.247
Beautiful work.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.782
So we got a deal, papa.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.424
That probably has been
the fastest sale I've ever done.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.558
Garin.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.959
$2.9 million, you got it.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.596
I love you.

22:43.630 --> 22:44.597
I like Rich.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.533
I like everybody.

Hey, Michael, how are you?

23:29.576 --> 23:31.411
(Michael)
I'm good, how are you?

23:31.444 --> 23:33.613
Okay, um,

23:33.646 --> 23:36.316
so I'm standing in penthouse
three right now, and...

23:36.349 --> 23:38.118
(Michael)
Yeah?

23:38.151 --> 23:42.088
There's no...furniture.

23:42.122 --> 23:43.256
Everything is gone.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.860
No.

23:50.997 --> 23:52.198
Don't freak out.

23:52.232 --> 23:53.733
I will call you back.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.906
[line trilling]

23:59.939 --> 24:01.775
(Olivia)
Hello, this is Olivia.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.043
Oh, hey, Olivia.

24:03.043 --> 24:05.211
It's me, Ryan Serhant.
How are you?

24:07.614 --> 24:11.618
(Ryan)
All of the furniture literally
is gone from penthouse three.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.896
That's because
you put penthouse one

24:22.929 --> 24:24.531
on the market already.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.666
Penthouse three we haven't even
put on the market yet.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.667
I haven't taken photos.

24:27.701 --> 24:28.968
Are you crazy?

24:31.871 --> 24:33.073
That--

24:36.609 --> 24:37.877
Oh.

24:37.911 --> 24:41.548
I decided to be nice
and give Olivia a head start.

24:41.581 --> 24:44.851
I thought, hey,
let her take her photos first,

24:44.884 --> 24:46.619
go to market first.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.988
Is this because of the bet?

24:49.089 --> 24:50.090
The stupid bet you're doing?

24:50.123 --> 24:51.191
Is that what this is?

24:55.095 --> 24:56.463
I do.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.265
I would also like
to sell penthouse three,

24:59.299 --> 25:01.868
but I didn't realize

25:01.901 --> 25:05.505
that you had the balls
to steal my furniture.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.843
Apparently that thing
that they say

25:09.876 --> 25:14.047
about nice guys finishing last,
uh, is true.

25:14.047 --> 25:15.782
You know what?

25:15.815 --> 25:17.751
I wasn't taking this bet
seriously,

25:17.784 --> 25:18.785
and now I am.

25:18.818 --> 25:19.786
Now it is on.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.788
Now it is on like Donkey Kong.

Gloves off, baby.

No more Mr. Nice Guy.

Oh, my God, I think
I taught her too well.

I hope she knows how to swim.

Come, you sexy beast.

25:37.237 --> 25:39.539
- Sit next to me.
- [chuckles]

25:39.572 --> 25:41.141
So what happened today
with the dogs?

25:41.174 --> 25:42.642
Yeah, I'm sorry
I couldn't bring you guys,

25:42.676 --> 25:45.345
but I think it was important
I made this deal.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.379
- So you closed the deal?
- Full ask.

25:46.413 --> 25:47.414
Yeah, closed, done.
It's done.

25:47.447 --> 25:48.448
What, in the dogsled?

25:48.481 --> 25:49.582
Well, we were negotiating.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.084
It's just quite funny
because in the end,

25:51.084 --> 25:52.318
she was, like,
trying to push me.

25:52.352 --> 25:54.087
She's like, "You're so small,
big, or whatever."

25:54.087 --> 25:55.188
And I was like, "No, you are."

25:55.221 --> 25:56.222
Then I pushed her
in the snow,

25:56.256 --> 25:57.824
and then we started, like,
throwing snow.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.092
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

25:59.092 --> 26:00.060
But then you know me.

26:00.093 --> 26:01.161
Closed the deal
in the end.

Yes.

I think we both
were so happy.

- It's amazing.

gonna be honest with you--

that crossed my mind was, like,

"I'm not gonna be able
to ask her again for her eggs."

I don't want to give up

26:39.699 --> 26:43.870
on the question that I asked you
a few months back.

the first time,

26:56.116 --> 26:58.251
you know, going back and forth.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.020
At first, I was thinking,
"Yes, you know,

27:00.053 --> 27:04.157
maybe it would be the most
amazing, beautiful experience."

27:04.190 --> 27:06.793
But then, you know,

27:06.826 --> 27:08.528
I couldn't come
to a decision,

27:08.561 --> 27:09.763
and then I met somebody,

27:09.796 --> 27:12.932

really care for.

to make you feel bad,

we're supportive

27:23.510 --> 27:25.111

what my gut instinct is.

I just cannot do it right now.

29:56.596 --> 29:58.298
but I have one spoon
and I can't find it,

29:58.331 --> 30:00.767
and without my spoon...

30:00.800 --> 30:02.836
Well, I don't have people over.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.908
(Luis)
Um, then we go out.

30:08.942 --> 30:11.378
Can you do me a favor and buy me
another spoon or two?

30:15.448 --> 30:19.819
* *

30:19.853 --> 30:21.554
(Fredrik)
The trip to Sweden didn't go

30:21.588 --> 30:24.157
exactly the way we hoped.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.926
But there's nothing
to cheer me up

30:26.960 --> 30:31.431
like a beautifully finished
townhouse in the West Village.

30:31.464 --> 30:32.932
Fredrik, welcome back.

30:32.966 --> 30:35.001
How do you like it?

30:35.035 --> 30:43.476
* *

30:43.510 --> 30:44.577
Wow.

30:44.611 --> 30:45.945
(Fredrik)
When I took on this listing,

30:45.979 --> 30:47.547
it was a construction site,

30:47.580 --> 30:49.182
a gut renovation.

30:54.621 --> 30:56.389
And despite my creativity...

30:56.423 --> 30:57.757
- Oh.
- Look in here.

30:57.791 --> 30:58.825
(Fredrik)
Click.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.326
(woman)
Oh, wow.

31:00.360 --> 31:02.962
The finishes are remarkable.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.731
Somewhere
in the high teens?

31:04.764 --> 31:06.099
With these finishes?

31:06.132 --> 31:07.467
It became pretty clear

31:07.500 --> 31:10.537
that buyers need to see
a fully finished product

31:10.570 --> 31:12.439
to pay $22 1/2 million.

31:23.116 --> 31:24.217
You got the Nana doors.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.352
How much were these,
again?

31:25.385 --> 31:26.519
These were hundreds
of thousands.

31:26.553 --> 31:27.787
(Fredrik)
Wow.

31:27.821 --> 31:30.123
I love the floors.

31:30.156 --> 31:32.525
Two fireplaces, beautiful.

31:32.559 --> 31:35.161
At one point, the developer
tried to back out

31:35.195 --> 31:36.996
of the finishes
that we had agreed to.

31:42.435 --> 31:47.240
Luckily, I was able
to bring them to their senses.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.341
(Fredrik)
I feel good.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.110
You did what
I wanted you to do,

31:50.110 --> 31:53.246
and now I feel so good
that it looks so good!

31:53.279 --> 31:54.981
Oh, oh, my God!

31:55.015 --> 31:58.118
I used to look up here
and see nothing.

32:03.556 --> 32:05.925
(Fredrik)
You took all my advice
when it came to staging.

32:05.959 --> 32:07.761
$200,000 of furniture.

32:07.794 --> 32:10.630
(Fredrik voice-over)
The finishes are exactly
what I told the developer

32:10.663 --> 32:13.400
that we would need
to get top dollars.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.468
(Fredrik)
So this floor,
the entire master,

32:15.502 --> 32:16.770
like we discussed.

32:16.803 --> 32:18.271
Two full bathrooms,
finally done.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.073
[phone chimes]

32:20.073 --> 32:22.075
See, this is what he's doing
to me all the time.

32:23.543 --> 32:26.546
"Is it sold!!!!!"
Five exclamation marks.

32:26.579 --> 32:27.847
It's not even a question mark.

32:27.881 --> 32:30.083
Only five?

32:30.083 --> 32:31.851
Dressing area,
walk-in closets.

32:31.885 --> 32:35.121
And then, one of my favorite
parts of the house.

32:35.155 --> 32:37.290
(Tom)
Her master bath.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.758
(Fredrik)
It's everything
that I was hoping for.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.827
(Tom)
Couldn't be any better.

32:40.860 --> 32:41.828
We did it.

32:41.861 --> 32:43.463
We did it.
Now you have to do it.

32:43.496 --> 32:46.099
[phone chimes]

32:46.099 --> 32:47.300
I'm getting messages,
messages, messages.

32:47.334 --> 32:48.535
He's emailing me nonstop.
It's like--

32:48.568 --> 32:50.837
That's right.
This is our mantra: "Sell."

32:50.870 --> 32:53.440
I mean, clients love to tease
me, because I'm number one.

32:53.473 --> 32:54.441
[phone chimes]

32:54.474 --> 32:56.409
Oh, here comes another message.

32:56.443 --> 32:57.777
(Fredrik)
It's like,
I take on the listing,

32:57.811 --> 32:59.846
and then within an hour
they're starting to ask,

32:59.879 --> 33:01.281
"Did you sell it yet?"

33:01.314 --> 33:02.649
These guys.

33:02.682 --> 33:04.784
It's actually
like they're serious.

33:04.818 --> 33:06.786
Do they think I've sold it
in one hour?

33:08.221 --> 33:10.490
[phone ringing]

33:10.523 --> 33:11.725
Hello?

33:14.594 --> 33:15.962
What offers?
They're coming.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.297
- I mean, they're--I got to--
- They're coming.

33:17.330 --> 33:18.798
- They're coming.
- Now I can finally do my job

33:18.832 --> 33:20.934
and show the house, and people
are gonna understand it.

33:20.967 --> 33:24.137
(Fredrik)
Developers always
have high expectations.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.639
But there's a difference
between high expectations

33:26.673 --> 33:28.508
and unrealistic expectations.

33:28.541 --> 33:30.977
I'll text you.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.078
I got it, I got it.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.079
Just promise me
one thing:

33:33.113 --> 33:34.481
no more
text messages.

33:34.514 --> 33:36.082
These guys need to back off,

33:36.082 --> 33:38.084
give me some time,
give me space,

33:38.084 --> 33:40.086
and I know I can sell
this townhouse.

33:40.086 --> 33:42.288
I will sell it.

33:42.322 --> 33:43.289
[phone chimes]

33:43.323 --> 33:44.324
(Fredrik)
Oh, another one.

33:44.357 --> 33:45.692
(Tom)
That one's from me.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.965
[line trilling]

33:51.998 --> 33:54.868
(Richard)
You have reached Rich Hamilton
with DG Neary Realty.

33:54.901 --> 33:57.971
I f***ing hate
this f***ing guy.

33:58.004 --> 34:00.674
Can you tell me,
where is Rich Hamilton?

34:00.707 --> 34:02.042
It's been seven days.

34:02.075 --> 34:04.044
I really don't know
what we can do at this point.

34:04.044 --> 34:06.513
Just tell me, "Listen, we don't
like the apartment anymore.

34:06.546 --> 34:08.248
My client has gone broke."

34:08.281 --> 34:11.451
Just give me a reason, but--
but call me!

34:11.484 --> 34:13.153
It's been a week
since I sent the contract

34:13.186 --> 34:14.421
to Richard Hamilton.

34:14.454 --> 34:17.424
Not only do I not have
his contract in my hands,

34:17.457 --> 34:20.794
but he's also avoiding my calls.

34:20.827 --> 34:22.429
I've been doing this long enough
to understand

34:22.462 --> 34:25.065
that no news is bad news.

34:25.065 --> 34:26.299
We've tried everything.

34:26.332 --> 34:27.801
We called his office.
We called his cell phone.

34:27.834 --> 34:28.968
We called his pager.

34:29.069 --> 34:30.603
I don't even know
why he has a pager.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.675
I have never had a broker
do this to me before,

34:35.709 --> 34:38.078
just disappear.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.412
I have to call Garin.

34:39.446 --> 34:42.449
[touch tones beeping]

34:42.482 --> 34:45.085
[line trilling]

34:45.085 --> 34:46.186
I have him on the line.

34:46.219 --> 34:47.187
Are you ready?

34:47.220 --> 34:48.621
Yeah.

34:48.655 --> 34:51.124
Garin.

34:51.157 --> 34:53.693
I'm afraid
I don't have good news.

34:53.727 --> 34:57.664
I have not been able
to get a hold of this broker.

34:57.697 --> 34:58.832
I've reached out
to his cell phone,

34:58.865 --> 35:00.567
I sent letters,
I reached to his office,

35:00.600 --> 35:02.335
and I've reached out
to his pager,

35:02.369 --> 35:04.270
which I don't even know
why he has one,

35:04.304 --> 35:06.639
and I can't find him.

35:06.673 --> 35:08.174
At this point, it feels to me

35:08.208 --> 35:10.410
that the deal
is not gonna go through.

35:20.053 --> 35:21.454
I think we should
start from scratch

35:21.488 --> 35:23.123
and just continue
to find a new buyer.

35:36.703 --> 35:37.804
Let's not--
let's not just take it

35:37.837 --> 35:39.706
off the market completely, okay?

35:39.739 --> 35:42.175
I know it sucks,
but I believe

35:42.208 --> 35:43.943
in my ability
to be able to sell this one.

35:46.513 --> 35:47.614
Who knows, maybe we'll end up

35:47.647 --> 35:49.916
getting it sold
for a higher price.

35:49.949 --> 35:52.919
[suspenseful music]

36:00.927 --> 36:02.095
Okay, I appreciate that.

36:02.128 --> 36:03.897
Let me just get back to work.

36:03.930 --> 36:06.199
(Luis)
Even though
this is not my fault...

36:06.232 --> 36:07.867
All right, good-bye.

36:07.901 --> 36:12.038
(Luis)
It's still my reputation
on the line.

36:12.038 --> 36:13.740
My top priority--no, no, no.

36:13.773 --> 36:15.575
My only priority

36:15.608 --> 36:18.278
is to find a new buyer fast.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.713
Let's go back
to re-marketing this thing.

36:19.746 --> 36:20.780
Sure.

36:20.814 --> 36:21.881
And whatever
we were spending

36:21.915 --> 36:23.783
on marketing,
let's double that.

36:23.817 --> 36:26.619
(Luis)
Let's shove this listing
down people's throats.

36:26.653 --> 36:33.460
* *

36:33.493 --> 36:35.095
- Hello, hello.
- Hey.

36:35.128 --> 36:37.964
Lots of red balloons,
awesome.

36:38.064 --> 36:39.933
We'll have to see
what Ryan thinks of it.

36:47.741 --> 36:49.275
Wow.

36:50.643 --> 36:52.312
This looks good.

36:52.345 --> 36:54.814
Very, very creative with
the red and black balloons.

36:54.848 --> 36:55.815
Thank you.

36:55.849 --> 36:56.950
They're great.

36:56.983 --> 36:58.418
(Ryan)
Since Olivia hijacked

36:58.451 --> 37:00.453
the staging from my unit,

37:00.487 --> 37:03.023
she obviously gets
to throw her open house

37:03.023 --> 37:05.058
before I get to throw mine.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.629
Over 120.

37:09.662 --> 37:12.098
(Ryan)
So...I came by to help.

37:12.132 --> 37:14.034
- 120 RSVPs?
- Yep.

37:14.034 --> 37:17.671
Isn't that what a mentor
is supposed to do?

37:17.704 --> 37:18.738
Hi. Olivia.

37:18.772 --> 37:20.106
How are you?
Thanks for coming.

37:20.140 --> 37:21.841
Why don't you guys
take show sheets?

37:21.875 --> 37:22.942
(Ryan)
Follow the balloons,

37:23.043 --> 37:24.644
and this is
your private roof deck.

37:27.447 --> 37:28.748
No one else is up here.

37:28.782 --> 37:31.651
It's just the penthouse
roof deck of this apartment.

37:31.685 --> 37:33.453
Listen, I want
Olivia's penthouse to sell

37:33.486 --> 37:34.554
just as much as mine.

37:34.587 --> 37:35.889
From up here,
you can see the Empire State

37:35.922 --> 37:36.956
all the way over there.

37:37.057 --> 37:38.425
(Ryan)
Regardless of the bet,

37:38.458 --> 37:40.393
these are both my listings,

37:40.427 --> 37:42.062
and there's still
a commission involved

37:42.062 --> 37:43.730
with selling each of them.

37:43.763 --> 37:46.700
So this is fine, but there's
also another one downstairs.

37:46.733 --> 37:49.836
Penthouse three,
$2.35 million less.

37:49.869 --> 37:53.807
I just want mine
to sell first.

37:53.840 --> 37:55.909
- Want to take a look?
- Yeah, absolutely.

37:55.942 --> 37:56.910
Follow me.

37:56.943 --> 37:58.445
After you.

37:58.478 --> 38:00.013
(Ryan)
If someone's interested
in seeing another unit...

38:00.013 --> 38:01.114
Good luck.

38:01.147 --> 38:04.217
For be it from me
to keep it from them.

38:04.250 --> 38:06.619
So this one is penthouse three.

38:06.653 --> 38:07.687
Beautiful.

38:10.390 --> 38:13.026
It's empty, because I wanted
to show how big it is.

38:13.026 --> 38:14.060
It's nice, big, and open.

38:14.094 --> 38:15.061
There's no weird
stage furniture in here.

38:15.095 --> 38:16.062
Right.

38:16.096 --> 38:19.032
Olivia "borrowed" my staging.

38:19.065 --> 38:20.066
Great space,

38:20.100 --> 38:21.501
definitely built
for entertaining.

38:21.534 --> 38:26.139
So I am "borrowing"
some clients.

38:26.172 --> 38:27.340
(woman)
The kitchen's open,

38:27.374 --> 38:28.608
so you can see children playing

38:28.641 --> 38:30.043
when they are
in the living room.

38:30.043 --> 38:32.545
So this is washer/dryer,
'cause you're a family.

38:32.579 --> 38:34.047
You guys need this
in the apartment.

38:34.047 --> 38:35.348
(Ryan)
Upstairs you have
all those hallways.

38:35.382 --> 38:37.283
In this, you open up,
and it's nice and big.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.885
It's like,
"Come and see my kingdom."

38:38.918 --> 38:42.422
And then around here
is the master suite.

38:42.455 --> 38:44.958
So then this is the master,
which is pretty huge.

38:45.058 --> 38:46.626
Here's its own
little private terrace,

38:46.659 --> 38:48.061
which is awesome.

38:48.094 --> 38:49.729
I know you guys are looking
for outdoor space.

38:49.763 --> 38:51.865
Plus your own private terrace.

38:51.898 --> 38:53.500
(Olivia)
Check out the bathroom,

38:53.533 --> 38:55.268
which we can all
comfortably fit in.

38:55.301 --> 38:57.537
Then you have
a big master bathroom here.

38:57.570 --> 38:58.938
It's very spa-like.

38:58.972 --> 39:01.474
And you got two other bedrooms,
another bathroom.

39:01.508 --> 39:05.011
We can head over and see
the rest of the bedrooms.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.479
(Ryan)
Do you like this
more than upstairs?

39:06.513 --> 39:09.049
(woman)
I do, just because
this is practical.

39:09.082 --> 39:10.917
Which one, between this one
and penthouse one upstairs,

39:11.017 --> 39:12.052
- do you like more?
- I like this.

39:12.085 --> 39:13.286
- You like this one more?
- Absolutely.

39:13.319 --> 39:16.222
So if you have anybody,
you should bring them through.

39:16.256 --> 39:17.657
It's a good one.

39:20.026 --> 39:21.361
This guy I was just showing,

39:21.394 --> 39:22.862
I'm pretty sure
wants to buy this apartment.

39:22.896 --> 39:24.597
You think it's
'cause of the balloons?

39:29.135 --> 39:30.136
No, no, forget penthouse three.

39:30.170 --> 39:31.571
I hope you like
the Hudson River.

39:31.604 --> 39:32.906
Do you see what's over
my shoulder right now?

39:32.939 --> 39:33.907
What's over my shoulder?

39:33.940 --> 39:35.141
You should take your own advice.

39:35.175 --> 39:37.711
Oh, the Hudson River's
over my shoulder.

39:37.744 --> 39:45.752
* *

39:50.323 --> 39:53.693
Emilia and I have been
so busy at work lately.

39:53.727 --> 39:54.928
You made it here
really quickly.

39:54.961 --> 39:56.529
I was just trying
to find you.

39:56.563 --> 39:58.131
Occasionally I'll have her
come by an open house

39:58.164 --> 39:59.666
so that, even if I am working,

39:59.699 --> 40:01.568
we can still spend
some more time together.

40:03.236 --> 40:04.871
Uh, something downstairs.

40:04.904 --> 40:07.040
But I will admit,

40:07.073 --> 40:11.945
I do have an ulterior motive
for having her come tonight.

40:18.585 --> 40:22.355
* *

40:23.857 --> 40:25.392
Uh, something downstairs.

40:32.832 --> 40:34.100
So...

40:34.134 --> 40:35.502
it's brand-new.

40:35.535 --> 40:36.736
It's cool, right?

40:36.770 --> 40:38.672
Yeah,
it's really nice.

40:38.705 --> 40:40.407
It has big windows.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.976
So you've got
a washer/dryer here.

40:43.009 --> 40:44.411
Got three bathrooms.

40:44.444 --> 40:45.945
Mm-hmm.

40:45.979 --> 40:47.514
I see thousands
of apartments a year.

40:47.547 --> 40:49.516
It's very nice.

40:49.549 --> 40:51.751
I think
someone could do a lot with it.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.319
Yeah, for sure.

40:53.353 --> 40:55.622
(Ryan)
And there's something
about this space...

40:55.655 --> 40:56.623
It's well-priced.

40:56.656 --> 40:59.426
I mean, it's asking 4 million.

40:59.459 --> 41:02.896
That just spoke to me
the moment I saw it.

41:02.929 --> 41:04.698
Want to see the master bedroom?

41:04.731 --> 41:06.733
(Emilia)
I love how you get excited
about apartments.

41:08.368 --> 41:09.869
This whole thing
is the master.

41:09.903 --> 41:11.104
Wow.

41:11.137 --> 41:13.073
With your own
outdoor space.

41:13.106 --> 41:16.843
So you got two huge terraces.

41:16.876 --> 41:18.144
So what do you think?

41:18.178 --> 41:20.080
I think
it's a really pretty apartment.

41:21.314 --> 41:24.217
What do you think
about living here?

41:24.250 --> 41:25.618
What are you saying?

41:25.652 --> 41:28.088
I'm saying I think
we should live here.

41:30.957 --> 41:32.692
I think we should buy it.

41:32.726 --> 41:34.461
You and me?

41:34.494 --> 41:36.129
Me and you, baby.

41:36.162 --> 41:37.797
[laughing]
Come on.

41:37.831 --> 41:38.932
Seriously.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.837
We've got two other bedrooms,
possibly three.

41:43.870 --> 41:46.573
Put, like, six other
puffer munkins in there.

41:46.606 --> 41:48.375
And they'll be bouncing around
with their little ears,

41:48.408 --> 41:50.510
and they'll be, like,
looking all American,

41:50.543 --> 41:51.811
speaking all Greek.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.613
It'll be super confusing
to everyone in the building,

41:53.646 --> 41:56.483
but it'll be okay.

41:56.516 --> 41:58.118
What do you think?

42:02.222 --> 42:05.058
Emilia moved into my place
not too long ago.

42:05.058 --> 42:08.361
I very much have
kind of a bachelor pad.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.163
And now that we're engaged,

42:10.196 --> 42:13.767
I wanted a place
that is ours together

42:13.800 --> 42:17.070
that we can make a home in.

42:17.070 --> 42:18.672
(Ryan)
So you could wake up here,

42:18.705 --> 42:20.140
and you would look
at the terrace,

42:20.173 --> 42:22.509
and I would be
out there doing my yoga,

42:22.542 --> 42:25.311
because that's what guys
in their 30s start doing.

42:25.345 --> 42:29.783
Or you can start
bringing me breakfast in bed.

42:29.816 --> 42:31.217
You're so pretty.

42:31.251 --> 42:32.485
So that'll be
my closet,

42:32.519 --> 42:34.087
and then this
will be your closet.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.456
Yeah, we're gonna negotiate
on that one.

42:38.958 --> 42:41.761

Victor?

42:43.530 --> 42:45.131
You just scared
the sh** out of me.

42:45.165 --> 42:48.301
I am trying to create
a new price category here.

42:48.335 --> 42:49.469
We're setting a record.

42:49.502 --> 42:51.771
Fredrik, you have one week.

42:51.805 --> 42:53.106
[siren wailing]

42:53.139 --> 42:54.674
(Luis)
I was sitting with a client.

42:54.708 --> 42:57.577
I started getting pains
in my chest.

42:57.610 --> 42:59.713
* Hard out here for a bunny *

42:59.746 --> 43:01.614
Someone's gonna hit me.

43:01.648 --> 43:03.350
Hello.
