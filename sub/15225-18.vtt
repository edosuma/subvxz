TONY:
Hey, what's going
on, huh?

01:23.734 --> 01:25.634
How come none of you guys
are out driving?

01:25.667 --> 01:27.701
Louie's been upstairs
in a meeting for an hour,

01:27.734 --> 01:30.200
you know, with the, uh, company
executives and Mackenzie.

01:30.234 --> 01:31.501
Well, what's
the meeting about?

01:31.534 --> 01:32.534
Got me.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.167
Hey, does anybody know

01:34.200 --> 01:36.033
what's going on up there?

01:36.067 --> 01:38.100
Well, uh, don't
hold me to this,

01:38.133 --> 01:42.167
because I could be dead wrong,
but if it's what I think it is,

01:42.200 --> 01:44.334
I haven't got a clue.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.100
I know what...

01:48.133 --> 01:49.234
I know what it is.

01:49.267 --> 01:51.567
The company is broke.

01:51.601 --> 01:53.234
What? Where did
you hear that?

01:53.267 --> 01:54.501
From me.

01:54.534 --> 01:57.467
Today, this afternoon,
I tried to order parts,

01:57.501 --> 02:01.567
and everywhere I called, they
said that our credit is no good.

02:03.100 --> 02:07.100
Wow, the Sunshine Cab
Company is broke.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.901
LOUIE:
It's your fault-- all of you!

02:09.934 --> 02:11.467
You did this!

02:17.400 --> 02:20.767
You couldn't just drive
and be happy you had jobs.

02:20.801 --> 02:21.868
No!

02:21.901 --> 02:22.868
No!

02:22.901 --> 02:25.033
Everything had to be just so.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.601
The tires had
to have treads.

02:27.634 --> 02:31.367
The brakes had to have linings.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.334
Okay, prima donnas--

02:33.367 --> 02:35.968
you got them, now
you don't have jobs.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.434
I hope you're
satisfied.

02:37.467 --> 02:40.400
You finally killed
the golden goose.

02:41.467 --> 02:44.434
Now, wait a minute, boss--

02:44.467 --> 02:45.567
maybe you're upset,

02:45.601 --> 02:48.234
but before you go throwing
the blame around

02:48.267 --> 02:50.000
you better check
your facts.

02:51.434 --> 02:53.767
Anyone here go near that goose?

02:57.634 --> 02:59.167
What are
we going to do?

02:59.200 --> 03:01.234
We'll have to find ourselves
other jobs.

03:01.267 --> 03:03.334
I guess we'll have to go
to another cab company, huh?

03:03.367 --> 03:06.434
Hmm, not me,
I'm sick of driving.

03:06.467 --> 03:09.100
I think I'm going
to take this as a sign

03:09.133 --> 03:11.200
to break away and start fresh.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.200
Hey, yeah, maybe losing
our jobs is a blessing.

03:14.234 --> 03:18.667
Yeah, maybe it's time to get out
of the hack business.

03:18.701 --> 03:22.667
Maybe it's time for us to shed
these old, lousy, nowhere jobs

03:22.701 --> 03:25.701
and find new, lousy,
nowhere jobs.

03:25.734 --> 03:29.501
Sounds good to me.

03:29.534 --> 03:31.334
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Well, count me in.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.901
Okay, listen, we're all
going to be out there

03:34.934 --> 03:36.701
looking for
new jobs, right?

03:36.734 --> 03:38.200
And we're all gonna
be real curious

03:38.234 --> 03:39.934
to see what the others
have come up with.

03:39.968 --> 03:42.467
So, let's say in a month,
we meet at Mario's...

03:42.501 --> 03:44.868
All right, all right. Terrific.
We'll meet in a month.
Yeah!

03:44.901 --> 03:47.000
And we'll tell about the
great jobs we all got.
Yeah.

03:47.033 --> 03:48.868
Let's do it.
Come on! Stretch!
Hey, all right!

03:48.901 --> 03:50.300
( <i>scoffs</i> )

03:50.334 --> 03:51.534
Hey, Lou,

03:51.567 --> 03:54.334
how did, uh, Mackenzie take it?

03:54.367 --> 03:55.400
The captain?

03:55.434 --> 03:56.400
Yeah.
Huh!

03:56.434 --> 03:58.234
Don't worry about him.

03:58.267 --> 04:01.167
Nothing's going to get
that old buzzard down.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.467
Right now he's upstairs,
brainstorming for an idea

04:04.501 --> 04:07.567
and believe me,
he'll find a way out.

04:07.601 --> 04:10.067
( <i>gunshot</i> )

04:11.868 --> 04:13.267
I wonder how long
it took him

04:13.300 --> 04:14.868
to come up
with that one.

04:32.701 --> 04:34.501
( <i>Elaine screams joyfully</i> )

04:34.534 --> 04:37.434
Hey!
Hey, there she is!

04:37.467 --> 04:38.901
Thanks!
Oh, God.

04:38.934 --> 04:40.300
I'm so sorry
I'm late.

04:40.334 --> 04:42.234
I-I had to wait
for the sitter.

04:42.267 --> 04:43.634
So, uh, what did I miss?

04:43.667 --> 04:45.400
We've only been here
for a couple of minutes.

04:45.434 --> 04:47.133
Just time enough for "hellos."
ELAINE:
Oh...

04:47.167 --> 04:49.067
Oh, I haven't seen you
guys since that terrible

04:49.100 --> 04:50.100
day in the garage.
Yeah.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.434
Oh, yeah.
Yeck, that was awful.

04:51.467 --> 04:53.334
Yeah, but I knew Mackenzie
wasn't the kind of guy

04:53.367 --> 04:54.467
who'd shoot himself.

04:54.501 --> 04:56.901
Yeah, unfortunately
he was the kind of guy

04:56.934 --> 04:58.567
who would shoot
his accountant.

05:00.834 --> 05:01.968
So why don't we
get right down to it?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.400
Okay.
What did everybody do
during the month?

05:03.434 --> 05:04.667
Yeah, come on, who's
going to go first?

05:04.701 --> 05:06.968
Uh...
What about
you, Tony?

05:07.000 --> 05:08.734
Okay, um, I looked
around a lot,

05:08.767 --> 05:10.701
and I couldn't find
anything, you know?

05:10.734 --> 05:14.300
So I had to take this job
with Lou-Lou the bookmaker.

05:14.334 --> 05:16.868
I go around collecting
money from people

05:16.901 --> 05:18.701
who are reluctant
to pay up.

05:18.734 --> 05:20.267
I was making
fantastic money,

05:20.300 --> 05:21.467
but then after awhile

05:21.501 --> 05:23.501
the moral problem
started to get to me.

05:23.534 --> 05:24.701
Hmm...

05:28.934 --> 05:30.968
I really appreciate
you taking the time

05:31.000 --> 05:32.534
to see me like this, Father.

05:32.567 --> 05:33.701
I always have time

05:33.734 --> 05:35.267
for those who come
to me with problems.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.601
Please, have
a seat.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.767
What can I do for you?

05:42.534 --> 05:44.267
Uh...

05:44.300 --> 05:47.300
Tony, if there's something
you want to tell me,

05:47.334 --> 05:49.601
you don't need
to feel embarrassed.

05:49.634 --> 05:51.434
I just don't know
how to start, Father.

05:51.467 --> 05:52.667
This is real tough for me.

05:52.701 --> 05:54.033
I'm not going
anyplace.

05:54.067 --> 05:57.567
Start, uh, whenever
you're ready.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.033
Well, you see, Father,

06:00.067 --> 06:02.934
the garage where I was
working, it went bankrupt,

06:02.968 --> 06:05.367
so I had to go out
and find another job.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.634
I couldn't find any.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.300
I looked real hard,
but I couldn't find one...

06:09.334 --> 06:11.100
except as a collector
for a bookmaker.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.300
A collector?

06:12.334 --> 06:14.501
You know, I go around
making people

06:14.534 --> 06:15.901
pay up their gambling debts.

06:15.934 --> 06:17.767
Sometimes I got to act tough
with them,

06:17.801 --> 06:18.968
but I never hurt nobody.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.234
Tony, I hope you
didn't come here

06:21.267 --> 06:23.300
expecting me
to approve of that.

06:23.334 --> 06:25.467
See, Father, if I didn't
do the collecting,

06:25.501 --> 06:26.534
somebody else would--

06:26.567 --> 06:27.934
somebody maybe not so nice.

06:27.968 --> 06:30.367
So I don't think it's so wrong
for me to keep doing it--

06:30.400 --> 06:32.267
just until I find another job.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.801
Come on now, Tony, if you
don't think it's wrong,

06:34.834 --> 06:37.267
why have you come
to me so troubled?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.934
'Cause you owe 300 bucks.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.634
Listen, I'm sorry, Father,

06:46.667 --> 06:48.701
but Lou-Lou says
you're already overdue.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.434
The money's got
to be paid today.

06:50.467 --> 06:51.534
I don't have
the money!

06:51.567 --> 06:53.667
I don't know
what I'm going to do.

06:55.801 --> 06:58.234
Well, how did you let
this happen, Father?

06:58.267 --> 07:03.367
I gave the locker room prayer
for the Giants that week.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.601
The team looked so up
for the game,

07:05.634 --> 07:08.734
I didn't see
how they could lose.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.434
Especially with
the 14-point spread.

07:11.467 --> 07:16.501
Father, isn't it illegal and
a sin to bet with a bookmaker,

07:16.534 --> 07:18.334
even with the spread?

07:18.367 --> 07:20.467
14 points.

07:23.767 --> 07:25.934
Yes, I sinned...

07:25.968 --> 07:29.033
and now I have to do penance.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.400
I hate to do this.
Well, you...

07:31.434 --> 07:32.868
But I don't
have any choice.

07:32.901 --> 07:34.367
That's right.

07:36.367 --> 07:39.300
This watch was a
personal gift to me

07:39.334 --> 07:41.067
from the Archbishop.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.434
Give it to Lou-Lou.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.501
I can't do this, Father.

07:44.534 --> 07:46.767
No, no, no. I made a mistake,
I should pay for it.

07:46.801 --> 07:48.400
Forget about
the sentiment.

07:48.434 --> 07:52.367
Nah, nah, you don't understand.
He only takes cash.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.767
Perhaps if I spoke
to him personally.

07:55.801 --> 07:58.133
Come on, I'll go with you
to give it to him.

07:58.167 --> 08:00.367
No, he ain't going to take it,
Father, I'm telling ya.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
I have faith, Tony.

08:01.434 --> 08:04.100
I always put my faith
in the Lord.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.901
Well, as long as you
don't put your faith

08:05.934 --> 08:07.667
in the Giants again.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.234
( <i>knocking at door</i> )

08:13.267 --> 08:14.667
I'll-I'll talk to you later.

08:14.701 --> 08:15.701
Come in.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.133
Hey, Tony, you're
back from making

08:17.167 --> 08:18.367
your collections
already, huh?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.434
Yeah.
How'd it go?

08:19.467 --> 08:20.467
Fine.

08:20.501 --> 08:21.534
Good.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.234
Who gave us the priest?

08:28.100 --> 08:30.067
He's the one
who owes you

08:30.100 --> 08:31.601
the $300 from the...
Get rid of him.

08:31.634 --> 08:33.868
Yeah, but he wants
to talk to you about...

08:33.900 --> 08:35.433
Tony, I don't want
to talk to no priest.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.900
I don't want no
priest in my office.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.801
Father, would you excuse me
for one second, okay?

08:39.833 --> 08:40.933
Just a second.

08:40.967 --> 08:41.967
( <i>mutters</i> )

08:43.467 --> 08:44.868
Lou-Lou, he don't
have the money.

08:44.901 --> 08:46.267
He came here to
give you a watch.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.133
I don't want no watch.

08:48.167 --> 08:49.634
When somebody
don't pay up,

08:49.667 --> 08:52.300
it's your job to explain
those rules to them

08:52.334 --> 08:55.434
by whatever means
available.

08:55.467 --> 08:58.200
Father, you want
to come in here, please?

09:02.968 --> 09:05.267
Hey, Father, I'm just gonna have
to pay up your debt myself.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
I can't let
you do that.

09:06.334 --> 09:07.367
No, no, Father, it's okay.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.467
I'd rather do it this way.

09:08.501 --> 09:11.434
Tony, Tony, don't be a sap.

09:13.033 --> 09:17.434
All right, I can afford it
better than Tony can.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.634
Give me the watch, Father,
and we're even.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.634
It was given to me
by the Archbishop...

09:22.667 --> 09:24.400
Yeah, yeah,
sure.

09:26.968 --> 09:29.634
Thank you, Lou-Lou,
you're a good man.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.334
I want you both to know

09:31.367 --> 09:33.834
I'm never going
to gamble again.

09:35.234 --> 09:36.501
Thank you, Tony.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.167
Any time, Father.
See you later.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.267
I can't believe
you took his watch.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.734
I'm sure I will
treasure it forever.

09:50.033 --> 09:52.200
Hey, uh, Lou-Lou, uh, I
don't want to mention this,

09:52.234 --> 09:54.634
but you said I was
getting paid Friday

09:54.667 --> 09:56.567
and today's Friday, and
I really need the money.

09:56.601 --> 09:58.033
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.200
Here, congratulations.

10:11.601 --> 10:15.000
So, uh, Elaine,
that makes you next.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.534
Well, okay.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.367
I went to work
as a secretary

10:18.400 --> 10:20.701
for this large
corporation
downtown, right?

10:20.734 --> 10:23.067
So, the first day the
personnel director

10:23.100 --> 10:26.234
takes me to the office
and she just leaves me there.

10:26.267 --> 10:28.033
So I'm sitting there
waiting for my boss,

10:28.067 --> 10:29.834
wondering what he's
going to be like...

10:34.400 --> 10:37.167
Are you Mr. Givens'
secretary?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.968
Uh, yes. Hello, um, my name is
Elaine Nardo, and I...

10:40.000 --> 10:43.868
Don't try to be
pleasant with me.

10:43.901 --> 10:45.834
Is he in his office?

10:45.868 --> 10:47.033
Uh, no, I-I'm sorry.

10:47.067 --> 10:48.100
He's not in right now.

10:48.133 --> 10:49.901
Well, then, perhaps
you'll be so kind

10:49.934 --> 10:54.334
as to tell me where
that horse's rear end is.

10:54.367 --> 10:56.968
He was supposed to be in my
office half an hour ago.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.133
If Mr. Givens doesn't have
a good excuse this time,

11:00.167 --> 11:01.200
he's fired.

11:01.234 --> 11:03.267
Uh...

11:03.300 --> 11:05.467
he's, uh... his car broke down.

11:05.501 --> 11:07.667
Splendid, Miss Nardo.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.300
I'm George Givens.

11:11.234 --> 11:13.534
Welcome aboard.

11:16.334 --> 11:17.667
You're Mr. Givens?

11:19.067 --> 11:20.667
Why did you do that?

11:20.701 --> 11:22.901
Ah, I was just
giving you

11:22.934 --> 11:25.868
a little battlefield
experience.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.801
It doesn't happen often,

11:27.834 --> 11:31.501
but every once in awhile,
people look for me.

11:34.534 --> 11:36.000
When they do,

11:36.033 --> 11:40.834
it's very important
that I be somewhere else.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.234
Why?

11:42.267 --> 11:44.367
Sit down, Miss Nardo.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.634
I've been working
for this company

11:46.667 --> 11:48.400
for 23 years.

11:48.434 --> 11:51.100
That is a record.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.534
No one's been here
longer than I have,

11:53.567 --> 11:57.167
and the reason
I've lasted so long

11:57.200 --> 12:00.667
is because no one
quite knows who I am.

12:03.634 --> 12:05.734
Oh, some people
know my face.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.834
Some people know my name.

12:07.868 --> 12:11.634
But very few of them
put them together.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.834
My dearest friends
in this company

12:13.868 --> 12:15.601
know me as
"what's-his-name?"

12:15.634 --> 12:16.868
Come on, now--

12:16.901 --> 12:19.567
isn't this a little
ridiculous, Mister...

12:23.100 --> 12:26.267
You're right,
you <i>are</i> forgettable!

12:26.300 --> 12:27.934
Thank you.

12:27.968 --> 12:29.367
Over the years,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.400
I've developed
a lot of techniques.

12:31.434 --> 12:32.801
For instance, meetings

12:32.834 --> 12:34.767
are my biggest challenge.

12:34.801 --> 12:37.400
I slip in
with the crowd,

12:37.434 --> 12:41.667
and I never say anything
except "Mm-hmm"

12:41.701 --> 12:43.934
or "Mm-mmm."

12:43.968 --> 12:45.434
And most importantly,

12:45.467 --> 12:49.000
I laugh only after everyone
else starts laughing

12:49.033 --> 12:51.534
and stop cleanly
before they stop.

12:51.567 --> 12:52.834
Do you have any questions?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.200
Yes... uh...

12:55.234 --> 12:57.534
Mr. Givens, I don't know
much about business...

12:57.567 --> 12:59.100
Oh, that
doesn't matter.

12:59.133 --> 13:01.634
But, uh, I've read
some of your reports

13:01.667 --> 13:04.801
and I think it's wonderful
what you've written.

13:04.834 --> 13:07.200
You read my reports?
Yes.

13:07.234 --> 13:09.901
What do you think, I write
those reports to be read?

13:11.133 --> 13:12.100
But-but Mr. Givens,

13:12.133 --> 13:13.801
I-I was so impressed.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.667
You shouldn't be afraid
to speak out.

13:16.701 --> 13:19.067
Mr. Givens, a man
with your experience

13:19.100 --> 13:22.033
and-and your obvious
intelligence should be heard.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.801
You shouldn't deprive others
of your ideas.

13:24.834 --> 13:25.934
You really think so?

13:25.968 --> 13:28.901
Oh, I know so.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.400
I don't know,
I, uh...

13:30.434 --> 13:31.734
it's been a long time

13:31.767 --> 13:32.934
since I had that...

13:32.968 --> 13:35.300
Well,
hello there.

13:35.334 --> 13:36.801
Hi, how are you?

13:36.834 --> 13:39.400
Good, good! Oh!

13:39.434 --> 13:41.934
It's good
to see you.

13:41.968 --> 13:43.901
Mr. Givens in?

13:46.968 --> 13:50.701
Thank you for your illuminating
report, Mr. Barrett.

13:50.734 --> 13:52.133
Good show, Jack.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.801
Now, if there are
no other reports

13:53.834 --> 13:55.734
I think we can adjourn
the meeting.

13:57.267 --> 13:58.601
ELAINE:
Mr. Givens...

13:58.634 --> 14:01.367
Mr. Givens, your ideas
are so much better

14:01.400 --> 14:02.834
than anyone
else's here.

14:02.868 --> 14:06.234
Please, Mr. Givens, this company
needs to hear from men like you.

14:06.267 --> 14:07.367
Maybe tomorrow.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.734
Mr. Givens?

14:08.767 --> 14:10.367
What if they don't
like my ideas?

14:10.400 --> 14:11.534
Maybe they'll fire me.

14:11.567 --> 14:12.701
Oh, no, no, no.

14:12.734 --> 14:14.300
The worst they'll do
is disagree with you.

14:14.334 --> 14:18.467
Mr. Givens, if you don't
give your report today--

14:18.501 --> 14:19.801
right now--

14:19.834 --> 14:22.400
your 23 years
with this company

14:22.434 --> 14:24.267
will come to nothing.

14:24.300 --> 14:25.701
Excuse me, gentlemen.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.300
Who said that?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.300
Who said that?

14:33.634 --> 14:34.734
You said that.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.367
I said that?
I said that.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.434
Oh.

14:37.467 --> 14:39.434
There's one more report.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.634
Very well, uh,
the chair recognizes...

14:42.667 --> 14:44.734
what's-his-name.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.267
Mr. Givens!

14:53.033 --> 14:56.767
Let me just summarize
what I've come to say.

14:58.667 --> 15:02.801
I've been with this company
for 23 years now.

15:02.834 --> 15:06.300
23 years?

15:06.334 --> 15:09.033
Yes.

15:09.067 --> 15:12.100
And I must admit,

15:12.133 --> 15:15.234
I've seen some mistakes made--

15:15.267 --> 15:18.200
not big mistakes--
little tiny ones.

15:19.367 --> 15:23.200
Damn it, I've seen
big mistakes made.

15:25.734 --> 15:29.400
I think I can
summarize my ideas

15:29.434 --> 15:31.701
with one
simple word,

15:31.734 --> 15:37.100
and that word,
gentlemen, is "divest."

15:37.133 --> 15:39.100
Get rid of the movie theaters.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.934
Cable television's
going to wipe them out.

15:41.968 --> 15:44.901
Don't tell me about real estate.

15:44.934 --> 15:48.033
Every yutz with ears
is into real estate.

15:49.601 --> 15:51.033
Forget
South America.

15:51.067 --> 15:53.467
You're not nervous
about South America?

15:53.501 --> 15:56.167
I'm nervous about South America.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.801
We don't need
burlap anymore.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.033
Polyethylene's taking
over the market.

16:00.067 --> 16:01.567
Sell the forests--

16:01.601 --> 16:04.767
sell the coal fields,
sell the chemical companies.

16:04.801 --> 16:06.200
Divest, gentlemen!

16:06.234 --> 16:07.734
Divest yourselves
of everything

16:07.767 --> 16:09.400
but the three
basics:

16:09.434 --> 16:13.167
Nuclear weapons,
hospitals and T-shirts.

16:17.667 --> 16:18.901
And, uh...

16:18.934 --> 16:22.367
if I'm wrong about this,

16:22.400 --> 16:27.367
my 23 years with this company
have come to nothing.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.601
Thank you,
gentlemen.

16:39.868 --> 16:43.000
Thank you for talking me
in off the ledge.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.200
I am so sorry about this,
Mr. Givens.

16:53.234 --> 16:54.934
It's all my fault.

16:54.968 --> 16:57.167
You know...

16:57.200 --> 17:00.534
it's the silliest thing.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.400
All these years,

17:02.434 --> 17:05.434
I've been so frightened
of being fired,

17:05.467 --> 17:07.133
and now that
it's happened

17:07.166 --> 17:09.733
it's far more hideous
than I imagined.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.534
What a lovely
family you have.

17:16.567 --> 17:20.133
Well, thank you,
but they're not mine.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.968
Who are these people?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.200
That picture came
with the frame.

17:28.734 --> 17:32.334
Executives who don't have
families are talked about,

17:32.367 --> 17:34.367
so I kept it on my desk.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.234
I see.

17:36.267 --> 17:39.400
I call the little boy Skipper.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.367
Good choice.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.234
He chipped a tooth
a couple of weeks ago.

17:50.367 --> 17:53.067
The oldest girl
is married now.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.234
Congratulations.

17:55.267 --> 17:56.934
Thank you.

17:56.968 --> 18:00.133
Her husband drinks a little more
than I'd like him to...

18:01.901 --> 18:04.000
I'm so sorry about this.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.934
Well, that's over.

18:07.567 --> 18:09.601
Good-bye.

18:09.634 --> 18:10.868
( <i>whispers</i> )
Bye.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.400
Miss Nardo...

18:21.434 --> 18:23.567
could I buy you dinner?

18:23.601 --> 18:27.434
I can still charge one last
big meal to my expense account.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.000
Oh, um, Mr. Givens,

18:29.033 --> 18:32.801
I don't know if I could do that
to a company that I work for.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.901
 <i>Used</i> to work for.

18:34.934 --> 18:37.467
They fired you, too.

18:41.701 --> 18:43.501
Let's break 'em.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.868
Well, it's
your turn next.

18:50.901 --> 18:54.634
Uh, I was a
door-to-door salesman.

18:56.033 --> 18:57.534
It was nice
getting away

18:57.567 --> 18:59.934
from the pressures
of driving a cab.

18:59.968 --> 19:03.334
Forgetting for awhile
about red meaning stop

19:03.367 --> 19:05.067
and green meaning go, oh!

19:06.400 --> 19:07.634
In fact--

19:07.667 --> 19:09.834
if it hadn't been for one thing,

19:09.868 --> 19:13.701
I would've gone on
being a door-to-door salesman.

19:13.734 --> 19:14.868
What was that?

19:14.901 --> 19:16.467
I didn't like it.

19:21.601 --> 19:23.601
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

19:28.133 --> 19:31.968
Uh... ( <i>clears throat</i> )

19:32.000 --> 19:36.667
how do you do, Mr. or Mrs.
Fill-in-name-of-couple?

19:37.667 --> 19:39.100
I, uh...

19:39.133 --> 19:40.901
I'm your-name-here,

19:40.934 --> 19:43.901
but you can
call me nickname.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.334
Uh...

19:47.367 --> 19:50.534
it's very nice to see you
this afternoon.

19:50.567 --> 19:52.667
( <i>clears throat</i> )

19:52.701 --> 19:54.367
Uh...

19:54.400 --> 19:55.734
May I ask you

19:55.767 --> 19:59.033
are you satisfied with
your present vacuum cleaner?

19:59.067 --> 20:02.634
Well, ours hasn't been working
too well lately,

20:02.667 --> 20:04.767
but I...
May I come in

20:04.801 --> 20:09.234
and-and talk to you
about Magic Carpet Wizard?

20:09.267 --> 20:10.601
Uh...

20:10.634 --> 20:12.934
I suppose so, yes, okay.

20:12.968 --> 20:14.367
Okay.

20:16.901 --> 20:18.334
( <i>laughs</i>
 <i>nervously</i> )

20:18.367 --> 20:20.667
I did it, I got in!

20:22.634 --> 20:25.400
I'm going to do
okay at this job.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.400
Okay...

20:28.434 --> 20:31.234
why don't you make
yourself comfortable?

20:31.267 --> 20:33.767
Uh...

20:33.801 --> 20:38.067
What you are about to see is a
revolutionary new carpet machine

20:38.100 --> 20:42.868
that's more than a vacuum,
more than a shampooer

20:42.901 --> 20:45.601
more than... something else.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.701
It's... the Magic Carpet Wizard,

20:49.734 --> 20:51.968
the all-purpose carpet cleaner.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.434
( <i>clears throat</i> )

20:53.467 --> 20:54.701
All right.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.000
Oops, a little dirt.

20:59.033 --> 21:02.200
Can your vacuum cleaner
clean that up?

21:02.234 --> 21:02.767
Yes.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.000
Of course it can--

21:04.033 --> 21:07.734
but can it
clean up this?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.267
Uh, well, I don't know...

21:09.300 --> 21:12.100
Well, and ho...
and how about this?

21:12.133 --> 21:14.267
Oh, no,
I don't think so.

21:15.434 --> 21:18.601
And, uh, and, uh, this.

21:18.634 --> 21:20.000
No.

21:20.033 --> 21:21.334
Oh, no!
Oh, just leave
this in...

21:21.367 --> 21:22.367
No.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.367
And how
about this?

21:23.400 --> 21:24.701
Ketchup!

21:24.734 --> 21:26.868
Does this machine
clean up ketchup?
Oh!

21:26.901 --> 21:29.100
We wouldn't call it
the Magic Carpet Wizard

21:29.133 --> 21:30.868
if it didn't
perform miracles.
Oh!

21:30.901 --> 21:32.234
Oh, oh, I...

21:32.267 --> 21:35.234
I-I think I get...
I get the point!

21:35.267 --> 21:36.601
I get the point!

21:36.634 --> 21:38.100
Uh... uh... uh...

21:38.133 --> 21:40.033
N-Now let me see
the machine clean it up.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.667
First, let's make it tough.

21:42.701 --> 21:43.868
( <i>clears throat</i> )

21:43.901 --> 21:45.868
Here, a little bit of that.

21:48.067 --> 21:50.300
Oh, no, no, wait, that's grease!

21:50.334 --> 21:51.467
That's grease.

21:51.501 --> 21:53.200
It ain't no problem
for the Wizard.

21:53.234 --> 21:54.901
Okay, there.

21:54.934 --> 21:55.968
Oh.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.033
( <i>muttering</i> )

21:58.067 --> 21:59.868
Let's grind it right in.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.467
Okay.

22:09.801 --> 22:11.234
All right.

22:11.267 --> 22:12.501
Okay.

22:15.033 --> 22:16.167
( <i>clears throat</i> )

22:16.200 --> 22:17.400
Now...

22:17.434 --> 22:20.367
that's enough.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.734
We are going to see this
cleaned up fast and easy.

22:29.868 --> 22:32.367
Where do I plug this in?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.434
Uh...

22:34.467 --> 22:35.701
let's see...

22:39.901 --> 22:41.534
Oh, there's-there's a...

22:41.567 --> 22:43.701
Uh...

22:43.734 --> 22:44.801
A book?

22:46.334 --> 22:48.801
A book?

22:48.834 --> 22:51.300
Oh, yeah, yeah...

22:51.334 --> 22:54.100
I didn't get the vacuum job.

22:54.133 --> 22:56.601
I'm selling encyclopedias.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.734
Okay, you're
next, Latka.

23:02.767 --> 23:04.200
What kind of a job
did you get?

23:04.234 --> 23:06.200
Well, I would love
to tell you about it

Hey, come on, Latka,

tables to be cleaned.

Okay. "Come on, Latka, there's
a lot of tables to be cleaned."

23:16.334 --> 23:19.901
You know, I-I would not
be offended by a tip.

23:27.834 --> 23:30.234

Keep it coming.

My God, what is that
in Corridor C?

23:44.434 --> 23:47.434
What's creeping down the wall
in Corridor C?

23:47.467 --> 23:48.834
Oh, my God!

23:48.868 --> 23:51.000
Actually, I'm really an actor.

23:51.033 --> 23:54.868
I was born dirty,
Mr. Gray...

23:54.901 --> 23:59.367
and every day
I get dirtier...

23:59.400 --> 24:00.968
and dirtier.
