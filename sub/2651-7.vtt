00:05.038 --> 00:06.189
Night!
No.

00:06.319 --> 00:07.993
Middle of the phone.
I got it. Get it.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.840
Oh! My arm's asleep! My arm's asleep!
Get the phone.

00:10.959 --> 00:14.511
That's me. Hello!
Hi. Yes, this is she.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.076
Who is it?
Okay. Oh, God.

00:17.161 --> 00:19.518
- Tell me what's happening!
- Haley has been arrested.

00:19.602 --> 00:20.718
What?

00:20.842 --> 00:23.722
Phone! Phone.

00:23.802 --> 00:26.284
I bet that's Mama. I was just
dreaming it was raining chickens.

00:26.404 --> 00:29.715
Mitchell, answer the phone! Look what I'm doing.
Look what I'm doing, huh?

00:29.803 --> 00:31.397
- Hello?
- Hey, Mitchell.

00:31.484 --> 00:33.875
I'm sorry to wake you up,
but Haley got arrested.

00:33.965 --> 00:36.434
Oh, God.
Haley got arrested.

00:36.565 --> 00:39.001
That explains the chickens.
It does. It adds up.

00:39.086 --> 00:40.600
What did she get arrested for?

00:40.727 --> 00:43.322
Oh, she got caught drinking
at some party.

00:43.407 --> 00:45.639
Look, could you drive up
to the college with us?

00:45.728 --> 00:47.366
I think we're gonna need a lawyer.
Yes, of course.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.884
And Cam and Lily can come over
and stay with Alex and Luke.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.683
I'll guard them with my life.
I hate to bother him.

00:52.769 --> 00:54.806
No, no. Don't be silly.
He's happy to do it.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.650
Okay, we'll be over in a little bit.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.170
Okay.
Oh, I get it.

00:58.290 --> 01:00.328
When you told Claire I would
come over and watch the kids,

01:00.411 --> 01:03.007
she was resistant because she
doesn't trust my parenting skills.

01:03.132 --> 01:05.361
No, don't be silly. She just
didn't want to put you out.

01:05.450 --> 01:08.890
She's got a daughter behind bars, and she's
got the nerve to say I'm a bad parent?

01:09.053 --> 01:10.884
You didn't defend me. 'Cause
she didn't say anything.

01:11.053 --> 01:14.126
Why are you protecting her?
Why is no one protecting me?

01:15.173 --> 01:17.086
No.

01:17.214 --> 01:19.889
¡Ay! Answer! Answer!

01:22.696 --> 01:23.846
What is-

01:23.935 --> 01:25.496
This better be good.

01:25.617 --> 01:28.176
Haley got arrested for drinking.
We gotta go bail her out.

01:28.257 --> 01:30.214
Do you still have a connection
to that judge upstate?

01:30.338 --> 01:31.976
He died.
¡Ay! Who died?

01:32.098 --> 01:34.134
An old friend of mine.
Ay, Jay, I'm so sorry.

01:34.218 --> 01:35.938
He died five years ago.

01:36.018 --> 01:38.933
Then why are they calling us in the
middle of the night to wake us up?

01:39.019 --> 01:40.898
Nobody died.
Haley's in jail.

01:41.019 --> 01:43.340
Okay. That makes more sense.
Claire has to go bail her out.

01:43.380 --> 01:45.178
Okay. Give me that.

01:45.261 --> 01:48.572
Claire, listen to me.
Take a lot of cash.

01:48.662 --> 01:52.942
And when you flash it to the
police, do not speak about it.

01:53.022 --> 01:55.491
Let the eyes do all
the talking, okay?

01:55.582 --> 01:57.779
I heard the phone.
Who died?

01:57.903 --> 02:00.419
- Jay's friend.
- Oh, Jay, I'm so sorry.

02:00.544 --> 02:02.741
Okay. I can't do this again.

02:03.584 --> 02:04.333
♪ Hey, hey ♪

02:11.667 --> 02:12.816
♪ Hey♪
♪

02:15.186 --> 02:17.828
It's breakfast
It's breakfast time

02:17.907 --> 02:19.705
It's brekky-brekky time

02:19.787 --> 02:21.542
Uncle Cam, I thought
I heard your voice.

02:21.628 --> 02:23.348
What are you doing here?
Where are my parents?

02:23.429 --> 02:25.740
Well, the school called, and
your sister won a big award.

02:25.830 --> 02:28.189
Nice try. The only person who'd
believe that would be Haley.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.822
- She's in jail.
- Jail?

02:30.951 --> 02:33.624
Lily, what did I say? That it
was only a matter of time.

02:33.711 --> 02:35.791
Okay, no. Didn't say that.
Okay, so here's the truth.

02:35.832 --> 02:38.667
Your sister was caught drinking,
but it's no big deal.

02:38.752 --> 02:41.393
Your parents are there
taking care of it right now. So-

02:41.472 --> 02:43.031
This is so awesome.

02:43.114 --> 02:45.834
I hope she hits the weights so she's
totally ripped when she gets out.

02:45.873 --> 02:47.673
Okay. Let's change the subject.
Have a seat.

02:47.754 --> 02:50.953
Have some breakfast. See if there's
anything on that plate you like a lot.

02:52.676 --> 02:54.907
Is this bacon?

02:54.996 --> 02:56.588
Course it is, silly.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.236
Been on a little bit of
a health kick lately,

02:59.316 --> 03:03.948
so I took a vegan cooking class,
and my new thing is facon.

03:04.037 --> 03:05.518
It's like real bacon.

03:05.597 --> 03:07.511
Except for the look,
the texture and the taste.

03:07.598 --> 03:10.318
Maybe the store-bought kind, but I make
my own, so it's not even real facon.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.472
It's faux facon.
Fauxcon.

03:13.599 --> 03:16.069
It's fauxcon disgusting. You
can't tell the difference.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.477
And guess which one's the real one?
That one.

03:18.561 --> 03:19.437
That one.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.593
Still that one.

03:24.683 --> 03:26.594
This is the best bacon
I've ever had.

03:26.723 --> 03:27.998
Oh, well.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.393
I can't wait to tell your
Uncle Mitchell that you love it.

03:30.483 --> 03:32.635
- Why would Uncle Mitch care?
- Because, my dear,

03:32.724 --> 03:35.035
that bacon you're eating
isn't bacon at all.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.400
No, no, no.
It's made entirely of soy.

03:37.525 --> 03:40.678
Luke's allergic to soy! His throat closes!
He can't breathe!

03:40.805 --> 03:42.286
Hello? Never mind!

03:42.406 --> 03:45.002
Okay. Okay. We have to, uh,
get you to the, uh, hospital.

03:45.127 --> 03:46.447
Come on, baby.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.527
Luke! Put the facon down! I'm
using it to scratch my throat!

03:49.647 --> 03:51.161
Okay. Let's go. Come on.
Go.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.285
Cam? C-Cam.

03:53.368 --> 03:54.598
That was weird.

03:54.689 --> 03:56.727
Hey, Claire, do you wanna
pick it up a little bit?

03:56.809 --> 03:58.802
Since when do you drive
the speed limit?

03:58.889 --> 04:00.802
My daughter has been
arrested for drinking.

04:00.929 --> 04:03.082
I would like her to sit in jail
and think about that.

04:03.171 --> 04:05.606
As a matter of fact, I might stop
and do a little outlet shopping.

04:05.692 --> 04:08.843
Who wants a pair of
last year's sunglasses, huh?

04:08.931 --> 04:10.925
Honey, try to relax.

04:11.013 --> 04:12.526
I don't feel
like relaxing, Phil!

04:12.652 --> 04:14.406
She has been in college
for six weeks!

04:14.492 --> 04:16.849
Yeah, and everyone goes
a little crazy at first.

04:16.933 --> 04:18.606
I remember one night,
freshman year,

04:18.692 --> 04:21.574
a bunch of us on the Frisbee
golf team got a case of Zima.

04:21.694 --> 04:24.767
Enough zaid.
More than enough.

04:24.856 --> 04:29.328
I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes it bothers
me how calm Phil is under pressure.

04:29.417 --> 04:32.568
It's like-like I'm the one
who's overreacting.

04:32.657 --> 04:34.057
That's good.
Let it out.

04:34.178 --> 04:36.170
I'm going to kill you.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.535
Jay, do you have
some time today?

04:39.659 --> 04:42.128
We need to go and pick out a stroller.
Just get whatever you want.

04:42.219 --> 04:43.733
I mean, it's what
you're gonna do anyway.

04:43.819 --> 04:46.699
What I want is a husband who likes to
go shopping for a stroller with me.

04:46.740 --> 04:50.781
If you had a husband who liked picking out
strollers, you wouldn't be having a baby.

04:50.861 --> 04:54.138
So, who wants to come with me to the
spoken word festival this evening?

04:54.222 --> 04:56.658
I only have two tickets, so
somebody's gonna be disappointed.

04:56.783 --> 04:59.661
I think it's gonna be you. Ay, Manny, I
would go with you, but I'm so tired.

04:59.743 --> 05:01.621
You just woke up.
How are you tired?

05:01.703 --> 05:03.934
Maybe because I'm turning
food into a human!

05:04.023 --> 05:05.903
Jay will take you.

05:05.985 --> 05:08.863
Sorry. I would love to go
to the spoken word festival,

05:08.944 --> 05:11.700
but I'm already going to the
I'd-rather-blow-my-brains-out jamboree.

05:11.786 --> 05:14.255
I can't believe this. I'm
living in a cultural wasteland.

05:14.346 --> 05:15.905
With a heated pool.

05:15.987 --> 05:18.376
Manny, vamos. You're gonna
be late for school.

05:23.108 --> 05:26.102
Oh, geez.

05:26.229 --> 05:29.382
Hello, Dede. Good morning, Jay.
Namaste.

05:29.469 --> 05:32.348
- Let's not do this.
- Oh, fine, silly.

05:32.430 --> 05:35.070
I'm on my way
to a retreat in Ojai.

05:35.150 --> 05:38.747
Since I'm passing through town, I
thought I'd pick up that photo album.

05:38.831 --> 05:40.629
You know, it's really
not a good time.

05:40.711 --> 05:44.467
- Oh, please!
- All right. I'll meet you on the street.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.626
Drive by slow
with the window open.

05:47.713 --> 05:50.353
I was dreading Dede finding
out that Gloria's pregnant.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.346
It's the one thing
Dede's hung on to-

05:52.435 --> 05:54.027
that she's the mother
of my kids.

05:54.115 --> 05:55.594
And considering
their history-

05:55.675 --> 05:58.554
¡Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
Ooh! ¡Ay, ay, ay!

05:58.676 --> 06:01.146
I- I wanna rip your head off!
What?

06:01.237 --> 06:03.432
¡- Una loca peligrosa!
- No! No!

06:03.516 --> 06:05.669
Huh? No, Dede!

06:05.758 --> 06:08.193
¡Ay! ¿ Qué pasa?

06:08.277 --> 06:11.158
I wasn't exactly looking
forward to round four,

06:11.239 --> 06:14.995
especially now that Gloria's
a bigger, slower target.

06:15.079 --> 06:17.389
I'd normally be
having breakfast right now.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.195
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Claire. Any updates?

06:23.280 --> 06:24.920
Not yet.
But we 're almost there.

06:25.002 --> 06:27.596
Last time you were over at the house,
you were looking at that photo album.

06:27.682 --> 06:29.833
- What'd you do with it?
- Oh, Dad, that was me.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.914
I think I put it
on the shelf behind the bar.

06:32.003 --> 06:35.520
- What are you doing there?
- They asked me to come along in case they needed a lawyer.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.243
Shouldn't they have
a real lawyer?

06:37.364 --> 06:40.005
Oh, God. Should we?
I am a real lawyer, people.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.717
Environmental law is a thing.

06:41.806 --> 06:43.285
Don't get all sensitive on me.

06:43.365 --> 06:45.198
I mean, someone
who doesn't defend pandas.

06:45.285 --> 06:47.961
Yeah, Dad, 'cause that's what I do.
I defend pandas in court.

06:48.086 --> 06:50.079
That's adorable. You know
what I'm talking about.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.967
Haley needs somebody who knows
criminal law, like Perry Mason.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.961
Okay. So I'm not a real
lawyer, but Perry Mason is?

06:56.049 --> 06:58.086
Oh, hell.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.969
Hello, Dede.
How you doing?

07:02.049 --> 07:03.962
Oh, mostly fine.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.681
I have something called
a telescoping uterus.

07:07.811 --> 07:10.690
Long story.
Aw, geez.

07:10.772 --> 07:12.524
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

07:12.611 --> 07:14.650
I can't breathe!
This boy can't breathe.

07:14.732 --> 07:16.405
He's having a severe
allergic reaction.

07:16.532 --> 07:19.844
No. You're squeezing me. He needs medicine.
His throat is closing up.

07:19.934 --> 07:21.846
Okay. Hold on.

07:21.934 --> 07:24.130
We have an allergic reaction.
A young boy.

07:24.215 --> 07:26.332
Obstructed breathing.
What happened?

07:26.414 --> 07:28.293
Well, somebody gave him some
soy bacon that was so good,

07:28.415 --> 07:29.850
he couldn't tell the difference.

07:29.975 --> 07:32.935
Mitchell,
I can't talk right now.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.531
Cam, it's Claire.
My phone died.

07:34.656 --> 07:37.297
I just wanted to make sure the kids got
to school okay. Of course they did.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.614
Why wouldn't they have? I hear
we got a boy who can't breathe?

07:39.778 --> 07:41.337
Right here.
What was that?

07:41.418 --> 07:44.139
I'm just watching an original Lifetime
movie called The Boy Who Can't Breathe.

07:44.259 --> 07:48.140
That sounded like Alex. Nope. Just
Amanda Bynes. Okay, gotta go.

07:48.220 --> 07:50.781
Cam. Cam?

07:50.860 --> 07:52.341
That's weird.

07:52.461 --> 07:54.692
Can you believe how many
waffle places we passed?

07:54.821 --> 07:57.621
I can't believe how much Dad belittles me.
What were there-five, six?

07:57.702 --> 08:00.537
I edited the law review. I
passed the bar on my first try.

08:00.662 --> 08:03.018
I have a briefcase. I'm
counting them on the way back.

08:03.102 --> 08:06.017
- Can we focus?
- Uh, hi. We're here for Haley Dunphy.

08:06.144 --> 08:08.420
I'm Mitchell Pritchett.
I'm Miss Dunphy's attorney.

08:08.503 --> 08:09.780
She won't be needing
a lawyer today.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.424
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

08:11.504 --> 08:13.496
I'd like to confer with my client now.
Thank you.

08:13.586 --> 08:15.665
All you have to do is post bail,
and she's all yours.

08:15.706 --> 08:17.425
Really? Oh.

08:17.505 --> 08:19.179
That's-
That's fantastic.

08:19.267 --> 08:21.986
Sir, I am in no mood to defend
my daughter today, believe me.

08:22.106 --> 08:24.906
Okay. But do you think it is
the best use of resources...

08:24.987 --> 08:26.867
to lock up college kids
who've had a few drinks?

08:26.948 --> 08:30.659
Ma'am, your daughter was charged with resisting
arrest and assaulting a police officer.

08:30.748 --> 08:31.900
What?
Ooh.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.902
Wow.

08:33.989 --> 08:36.220
You probably should have
called a real lawyer,

08:36.389 --> 08:38.269
'cause I don't-I'm not-Shh!

08:41.352 --> 08:44.192
Look, this
has gotta be some kind of mistake.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.583
Our daughter's tiny. There's
no way she assaulted anyone.

08:46.673 --> 08:50.349
Insulted, maybe. Was-Was the cop
wearing white socks and dark shoes?

08:50.434 --> 08:52.743
- That really sets her off.
- Maybe you should watch this.

08:52.873 --> 08:56.106
Stop! Put your hands where
I can see 'em!

08:57.715 --> 09:00.311
Oh! Okay. No-That's
very blurry footage.

09:00.395 --> 09:02.193
How can we be sure
that that's Haley?

09:02.316 --> 09:05.070
Don't you move. Don't hurt me!
I'm just a student!

09:05.156 --> 09:06.670
I'm Haley Dunphy!

09:10.117 --> 09:12.189
So hot.

09:13.359 --> 09:16.032
Hot in here.
No.

09:16.918 --> 09:18.479
How long is this gonna take?

09:18.560 --> 09:20.916
I should be in school.
I'm missing biology right now.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.957
You're in a hospital. Just
step out into the hallway.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.838
Listen to the nurses
and doctors talk.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.718
You'll learn more about
science and humanity here...

09:26.800 --> 09:28.842
than you would in a classroom
in an entire semester.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.160
Attention!

09:31.242 --> 09:33.393
If there's a yogurt in the
fridge that says "Theresa,"

09:33.483 --> 09:35.395
then only Theresa
gets to eat it!

09:35.483 --> 09:38.204
Drama. Soak it in.

09:38.324 --> 09:41.124
Oh, good God. Okay, Luke, the
opening is supposed to be in the back.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.562
No way. I don't want people to see my butt.
Do I have to get another shot?

09:44.685 --> 09:46.803
Are you going to cry again?
Should she be here?

09:46.885 --> 09:48.798
Okay, you know what? Nobody's
getting any more shots.

09:48.885 --> 09:51.207
We just have to wait for the
swelling to go down. All right?

09:51.247 --> 09:54.240
I'm gonna go check on a little paperwork.
I'll be right back.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.445
But if it doesn't go down,

09:57.527 --> 09:59.326
that leg might
have to come off.

09:59.449 --> 10:01.088
Sweet. Take them both.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.890
Then I could get some of those blade
legs and finally be able to dunk.

10:03.929 --> 10:06.160
How you feeling, champ?
What do we got here?

10:06.289 --> 10:10.842
The patient presents bronchial inflammation,
dermal pruritis and minor angioedema.

10:10.930 --> 10:12.924
Who can tell me the cause?

10:15.572 --> 10:18.690
It's an allergic reaction
to soy.

10:18.772 --> 10:22.484
Very good. The rest of you have a lot to learn.
Let's keep moving.

10:24.813 --> 10:26.407
Stay with Luke.

10:28.414 --> 10:30.407
What is taking so long?

10:30.495 --> 10:34.456
Well, in my experience, these
things can take time, so settle in.

10:34.576 --> 10:37.251
- This could be a while.
- There she is.

10:37.377 --> 10:39.811
Damn it!
Oh, thank God.

10:39.936 --> 10:41.930
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.

10:42.057 --> 10:44.448
Oh! What the hell were you thinking?
What happened?

10:44.537 --> 10:46.018
Well, it's not
a big deal, okay?

10:46.099 --> 10:47.976
There was a party,
and people were drinking.

10:48.058 --> 10:51.097
So the police showed up, and everybody ran.
So I did too.

10:51.220 --> 10:53.052
And I started climbing
down this fire escape.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.655
Oh, God. And then I heard a cop
yell to put your hands up.

10:55.741 --> 10:58.050
So I did, and I fell onto him.

10:58.140 --> 11:01.453
You could have been killed. Haley,
you're supposed to be an adult.

11:01.541 --> 11:04.012
How could you do something
so childish and so stupid?

11:04.103 --> 11:05.617
Okay, okay.
Let's calm down.

11:05.703 --> 11:07.341
We're all a little tired
and cranky.

11:07.422 --> 11:10.576
Best thing we can do right now is get
out of here, go get some waffles.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.741
I don't want waffles,
Phil, okay?

11:12.824 --> 11:14.418
I'm upset, and I want
to deal with this.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.097
All right,
I got some bad news here.

11:16.184 --> 11:19.304
This afternoon, Haley has to appear
before a disciplinary board,

11:19.386 --> 11:21.901
which will decide whether or not
she gets kicked out of school.

11:22.026 --> 11:24.462
What? Oh, wait. Wait.
No, I got that wrong.

11:24.587 --> 11:26.499
Ah! Oh, no, I got it right!

11:26.588 --> 11:28.658
Yes! Score.

11:28.748 --> 11:30.387
One for me.

11:30.468 --> 11:35.225
It's what it sounds like. It literally telescopes.
You see, what happens is-

11:35.308 --> 11:37.745
Dede, I hate to rush this,
but I'm late for a meeting.

11:37.870 --> 11:40.146
Oh. It's been great seeing
you, but can I walk you out?

11:40.231 --> 11:42.871
Okay. Sure.

11:43.991 --> 11:45.710
Ay, Jay, it's so weird.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.989
The moment I came through the door,
the baby started kicking like crazy,

11:49.071 --> 11:51.633
like it's trying to
claw its way out of me.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.870
¡Bruja!

11:53.953 --> 11:55.865
Oh, my God.

11:55.953 --> 11:58.833
- What is she doing here?
- You're going to have a baby?

11:58.914 --> 12:00.712
I don't believe it.

12:00.794 --> 12:02.866
Uh, Dede, don't get
all crazy about this.

12:04.915 --> 12:07.430
What's happening?
Her brain-It snapped.

12:07.516 --> 12:11.066
Oh! You're going to be a
father again, at your age.

12:11.156 --> 12:15.197
And here you were thinking you would
just sail off into the sunset...

12:15.278 --> 12:18.908
with your beautiful young wife,
not a care in the world.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.640
This is fantastic.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.791
I think my uterus
just fixed itself.

12:25.679 --> 12:27.434
Don't ask.

12:28.560 --> 12:30.792
Oh. Oh. Oh, no.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.555
Who lives like this?

12:32.642 --> 12:34.917
When I had a dorm room,
it was-oh, it was spotless.

12:35.002 --> 12:37.073
Can we just agree that girls
are dirtier than boys?

12:37.202 --> 12:40.083
What should we do? I'd like to start
by picking up some of these clothes.

12:40.124 --> 12:43.116
I meant about the hearing, Felix.
Do we have a game plan?

12:43.203 --> 12:45.725
I think the best thing we can do
is walk in there as a family...

12:45.804 --> 12:47.443
and let 'em know we support
Haley no matter what.

12:47.525 --> 12:50.643
At this rate, we are going to be supporting
Haley for the rest of our lives.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.320
Okay. I just sat
on half a peach, so I-

12:53.406 --> 12:55.637
No. I can't do this.
I'm-I'm waiting outside.

12:57.287 --> 12:59.325
Disgusting.
What are you wearing?

12:59.408 --> 13:02.401
- What? What's wrong with it?
- Honey, you are fighting for your future...

13:02.488 --> 13:03.928
in front of
a disciplinary committee,

13:04.048 --> 13:05.529
not entertaining
the Secret Service.

13:05.609 --> 13:07.442
In Legally Blonde,
Elle won her case...

13:07.530 --> 13:09.521
because she was true to
herself and dressed cute.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.761
Haley, this is real life,
not an excellent movie.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.565
Honey, just put on something
else and take down the makeup.

13:14.651 --> 13:17.247
Why are you guys acting
like this is my fault?

13:17.331 --> 13:19.368
Everybody was drinking.
Everybody ran.

13:19.451 --> 13:22.013
I just got caught. If anything,
I'm the victim here.

13:22.092 --> 13:26.007
What? Just stop-
Just stop talking, Haley.

13:26.093 --> 13:28.813
You're not the victim here.
You're the one who screwed up!

13:28.894 --> 13:30.647
You made one bad decision
after another,

13:30.735 --> 13:34.094
and now you're about to blow everything your
mother and I worked so hard to give you.

13:34.174 --> 13:36.088
And the worst thing is,
you don't seem to care.

13:36.175 --> 13:39.567
We all got up at 3:00 a.m. this
morning to bail you out of jail!

13:39.657 --> 13:42.377
We haven't eaten a thing. And you know
what I haven't heard from you yet?

13:42.456 --> 13:45.849
"I'm sorry, Mom. I screwed up, Dad.
Please forgive me."

13:45.937 --> 13:50.616
Now put on some real clothes. We'll see
you at the hearing. Do not be late!

13:50.698 --> 13:52.691
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

13:52.779 --> 13:55.375
To get that man a waffle.

13:58.541 --> 14:01.499
There. There. Did you feel it kicking?
Oh, yes! Oh!

14:01.580 --> 14:03.460
I remember those.

14:03.542 --> 14:06.980
Yeah, Claire kicked me
as soon as she grew legs,

14:07.062 --> 14:09.134
and she didn't stop
until she was four.

14:09.222 --> 14:11.340
Not Manny.

14:11.462 --> 14:14.821
He was so calm. I think that
he was reading in there.

14:14.904 --> 14:16.466
This is beautiful.

14:16.545 --> 14:18.776
Look at you two, having a
conversation like old friends.

14:18.864 --> 14:22.257
Well, it's easier to talk to her
when she's not choking me.

14:22.345 --> 14:24.985
I'm sorry. I went through
a bad patch there...

14:25.105 --> 14:28.543
when I was trying to find the
right balance with my meds.

14:28.627 --> 14:33.657
I recently discovered my cat
Frances buried in the backyard.

14:33.748 --> 14:36.105
I'm just praying
that she died first.

14:36.188 --> 14:39.342
Maybe you can dog-sit
for the shoe eater one day.

14:39.430 --> 14:43.583
Oh. Well, she is
a funny-looking thing.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.941
Don't listen to them.
You're beautiful.

14:46.031 --> 14:49.024
Turns out Gloria being pregnant
somehow made Dede think of her...

14:49.111 --> 14:51.946
as less trophy, more human.

14:52.032 --> 14:57.153
And all the animosity she had for Gloria just...
wafted up in the air.

14:57.232 --> 14:59.385
I hope you're hiring a nanny...

14:59.473 --> 15:02.434
because this one
won't lift a finger.

15:03.795 --> 15:06.515
And landed right on top of me.

15:06.594 --> 15:10.112
I don't remember him
changing a single diaper.

15:10.195 --> 15:11.677
What's that supposed to mean?

15:11.757 --> 15:13.509
You can't even remember
killing your cat.

15:13.596 --> 15:18.149
Oh, I don't think I did. But I'm sure
that you never changed any diapers.

15:18.237 --> 15:20.194
It's just that you were
better at it than I was.

15:20.278 --> 15:23.237
Oh, so I guess I was better
at late-night feedings...

15:23.319 --> 15:25.470
and cleaning spit-up too.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.074
You know what?

15:27.160 --> 15:30.199
He wouldn't help me pick up
a stroller or a blanket...

15:30.281 --> 15:31.873
or a bouncy chair.

15:31.960 --> 15:35.672
Oh, well, I had to get
that stuff on my own.

15:35.762 --> 15:38.118
He was just useless.

15:38.201 --> 15:40.240
You poor thing.

15:40.362 --> 15:43.161
Makes all sense now
why you became so crazy.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.082
Right?

15:45.203 --> 15:47.035
Listen to me, Jay Pritchett.

15:47.164 --> 15:49.680
If you don't change
your useless ways,

15:49.765 --> 15:51.722
you're gonna make me crazy too!

15:51.805 --> 15:54.321
Like Dede.
Gloria.

15:54.406 --> 15:56.637
Gloria!

15:56.725 --> 15:58.719
I just love our little visits.

16:01.366 --> 16:03.598
- Mom, I'm home!
- Oh, hi, Manny.

16:03.688 --> 16:06.044
Dede. How are you?

16:06.127 --> 16:07.245
Good.

16:08.289 --> 16:10.520
Dede, it's me.

16:10.649 --> 16:12.448
How are you really?

16:12.609 --> 16:15.489
I'm on a better path.
It's a journey.

16:15.571 --> 16:17.960
Thank you for asking, Manny.

16:18.051 --> 16:20.202
And thank you for your letters.

16:20.292 --> 16:23.841
It's a lost art. No one
puts pen to paper anymore.

16:23.932 --> 16:27.448
- Haley Dunphy?
- Yes, that's me.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.604
I'm Dean Miller with Admissions.
This is Professor Williams.

16:29.694 --> 16:32.162
- Hi.
- And this is our student representative Aidan Feldman.

16:32.253 --> 16:34.531
- Nice to meet you.
- Seriously?

16:34.614 --> 16:36.412
We sit next
to each other in econ.

16:36.535 --> 16:38.731
Oh! Right!
Don't.

16:38.816 --> 16:41.331
It insults both of us.
Mostly me.

16:41.416 --> 16:45.490
Move it along, Aidan. This is a
disciplinary hearing, not JDate.

16:45.577 --> 16:48.298
You are charged with public
drunkenness, resisting arrest...

16:48.377 --> 16:50.289
and assaulting
a police officer,

16:50.377 --> 16:54.008
all of which obviously violate
our school's code of conduct.

16:54.098 --> 16:56.694
Sir, if I may speak
on behalf of my client-

16:56.779 --> 16:59.460
- Who are you?
- I'm Mitchell Pritchett. I'm Miss Dunphy's attorney.

16:59.499 --> 17:01.378
We require students
to speak for themselves.

17:01.461 --> 17:04.657
There are no attorneys allowed.
You shouldn't even be here.

17:04.741 --> 17:07.381
What if I just sat in this chair and was
really super quiet and just listened?

17:07.461 --> 17:09.930
I'll allow it.
Knock it off, Aidan.

17:10.021 --> 17:12.743
Miss Dunphy, is there anything you
would like to say in your defense?

17:12.823 --> 17:16.101
Actually, I have no defense.

17:16.183 --> 17:19.096
I was drinking.
I am underage.

17:19.183 --> 17:20.903
I ran from the police.

17:20.984 --> 17:24.056
And even though it was an
accident, I injured an officer.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.900
I am very, very sorry.

17:26.986 --> 17:29.343
I've made a lot of bad decisions
since I've been here,

17:29.426 --> 17:32.339
and it's time I take
some responsibility.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.181
Like sometimes,
in the dining hall,

17:34.268 --> 17:36.988
I slip my pinky under the scale
when they weigh my salad.

17:37.068 --> 17:40.744
Also, I've missed more morning
classes than I've been to.

17:40.829 --> 17:43.469
- She's kid-
- I don't know what the policy is on dating T.A.'s,

17:43.590 --> 17:45.388
- but I think I broke it.
- What?

17:45.469 --> 17:46.984
Twice.
Oh, man.

17:47.070 --> 17:50.030
If we're gonna be completely honest,
on my application to get in here,

17:50.150 --> 17:52.792
I lied about the fact that
I was-No, objection!

17:52.871 --> 17:55.387
- On what grounds?
- Oh, he gets to say it.

17:55.471 --> 17:59.785
Miss Dunphy. Miss Dunphy,
we appreciate your candor.

17:59.872 --> 18:01.831
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

18:02.834 --> 18:04.665
Go, Wildcats?

18:04.754 --> 18:06.553
Oh, boy.

18:06.634 --> 18:08.547
That's not even our mascot.

18:10.075 --> 18:11.953
What does this do?

18:12.036 --> 18:14.915
I don't know, but thanks to
Obama, you're paying for it.

18:14.997 --> 18:17.386
Hey. You're looking a lot better.
How you feeling?

18:17.476 --> 18:19.069
Better than Kidney Stones
over there.

18:19.156 --> 18:20.911
You know what? Now that
you're doing better,

18:20.998 --> 18:23.433
I think I should call your mom
and tell her what happened.

18:23.518 --> 18:25.999
You know, I know it was a bit of
a rough ride in the beginning,

18:26.079 --> 18:29.277
but the important thing is is I
handled it and everybody's okay.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.391
- What happened to her?
- Hello?

18:31.479 --> 18:33.437
She passed out
watching a C-section.

18:33.521 --> 18:35.433
Cam? Never mind!

18:41.562 --> 18:43.236
What are you looking for?

18:43.323 --> 18:46.282
Nothing! I am making a lot
of noise because I'm angry!

18:46.363 --> 18:48.515
Gloria, I'm gonna help you
with the baby.

18:48.604 --> 18:50.162
I am not young,
like with Manny.

18:50.244 --> 18:54.079
I am tired already, and it's
gonna get harder from here.

18:54.164 --> 18:57.158
I can't do this on my own,
and you did this to me,

18:57.246 --> 18:58.918
so you're going to
be here this time!

18:59.006 --> 19:01.886
Back then, we were living
paycheck to paycheck.

19:01.966 --> 19:04.800
The reason I wasn't around
is I was working all the time.

19:04.886 --> 19:07.847
Believe me, Dede wasn't the only
one having sleepless nights.

19:07.927 --> 19:12.320
But now it's different. Now I
can help you with everything.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.839
Really?

19:15.929 --> 19:18.570
Let's start right now.
I like that one.

19:18.649 --> 19:20.483
Which one?
That silver stroller.

19:20.611 --> 19:22.887
No, we're going to get the green one.
Great. What's next?

19:23.011 --> 19:25.401
How 'bout I pick out
the wrong crib?

19:25.532 --> 19:28.046
How you doing, Alex? I'm fine,
except for the crushing blow...

19:28.131 --> 19:30.090
of knowing I'll
never be a doctor...

19:30.172 --> 19:31.731
or have a baby.

19:31.892 --> 19:34.170
I wonder what's going on with Haley.
I don't know.

19:34.254 --> 19:36.210
I've been so petty about your
mom judging my parenting,

19:36.294 --> 19:38.730
I haven't even thought about
what she's going through today.

19:38.815 --> 19:40.692
I feel awful. You know what?
I should call her.

19:40.775 --> 19:43.211
What are you talking about? Mom
thinks you're a great parent.

19:43.336 --> 19:46.374
She does? Yeah. She just
thinks you can't bake.

19:46.495 --> 19:48.489
Hello? Never mind.

19:51.097 --> 19:53.657
Making a child
is the easy part.

19:53.737 --> 19:56.413
The hard part is everything
that comes after.

19:56.498 --> 19:57.978
Keeping them safe.

19:58.059 --> 19:59.698
You can tell your mother
that my scones...

19:59.779 --> 20:02.780
are appropriately crunchy on the outside
while delightfully dense on the in-

20:02.860 --> 20:05.217
Saw that. Saw it.

20:05.301 --> 20:07.418
Making sacrifices for them.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.537
Hey, kid.

20:09.622 --> 20:12.262
I'll take you to that poetry
reading thing tonight.

20:12.342 --> 20:14.652
Actually, Dede and I
were just talking.

20:14.783 --> 20:16.581
She's a huge fan
of spoken word.

20:16.662 --> 20:18.780
And I would love to escort him.

20:18.864 --> 20:21.015
Please-
Go!

20:21.104 --> 20:24.415
And standing by them
even when they let you down.

20:24.585 --> 20:27.099
I really am sorry.
We appreciate that.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.858
It's good that you
stepped up today.

20:28.945 --> 20:32.577
Yeah. Sometimes it's healthy
to get a fresh start.

20:34.506 --> 20:37.784
Ugh. I can't believe this.
What am I gonna do?

20:37.868 --> 20:40.099
Well, they said you could
reapply next year.

20:40.227 --> 20:41.869
In the meantime,
you're gonna get a job...

20:41.948 --> 20:43.621
and you're gonna
take some classes.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.429
Well, I'm gonna buckle down
and get a lot more serious.

20:46.550 --> 20:48.030
Good for you.
Yeah.

20:48.149 --> 20:50.985
Where are my keys? Oh, they're
right there on the makeup table.

20:51.071 --> 20:53.585
Oh, honey.
That's a desk.

20:59.352 --> 21:01.026
Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

21:01.113 --> 21:03.627
I got kicked out.
So go ahead, make your jokes.

21:03.712 --> 21:06.354
- Get it out of your system.
- No, that's horrible.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.394
I'm so sorry. It'll be fine.
I'm sure of it.

21:09.514 --> 21:11.074
Thank you.

21:11.154 --> 21:13.589
Ew! What did you do
to my room?

21:13.674 --> 21:15.588
Well, it's not exactly
your room. It's mine.

21:15.715 --> 21:19.505
This goes. This goes. I hate that.
This is ugly. Haley, stop!

21:19.637 --> 21:20.627
Mom!
Mom!

21:20.716 --> 21:22.628
What is this, a solar system?

21:22.756 --> 21:24.988
It's molecules.
They're nerdy balls.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.635
Alex, don't fight with her.
She might have a shiv.

21:28.718 --> 21:31.279
We cool?
