00:40.155 --> 00:42.533
All set, Miss Blenkinsop?       

00:42.533 --> 00:44.493
Yes, Mr Selfridge.           

00:44.493 --> 00:46.328
All set, Mr Grove?           

00:46.328 --> 00:48.163
All set, Chief.            

00:48.163 --> 00:49.999
All set, Mr Crabb?           

00:49.999 --> 00:51.792
Good morning.             

00:51.792 --> 00:53.878
Yes, Mr Selfridge.           

00:53.878 --> 00:55.796
Good morning.             
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.       

00:55.796 --> 00:57.631
Ground floor, please.         

00:57.631 --> 00:59.717
Yes, sir.               

01:16.358 --> 01:18.360
They're coming!            

01:26.911 --> 01:30.956
Good morning. Morning.         
ALL: Good morning, Mr Selfridge!     

01:38.672 --> 01:40.758
Something's missing.          

01:47.723 --> 01:49.475
Erm...                 

01:50.809 --> 01:53.270
Customers!               
(LAUGHS)                 

01:53.270 --> 01:56.524
It is only five minutes past nine,  
Mr Selfridge.              

01:56.524 --> 01:58.984
They should be             
battering down the doors!        

01:58.984 --> 02:00.819
They should be swarming all over us. 

02:00.819 --> 02:04.949
Let's have some spot reductions on   
special lines for early birds only.   

02:04.949 --> 02:08.410
Nine am to midday. Work something up 
for me, will you? Yes, of course.    

02:08.410 --> 02:10.538
Good man.               
We need more sales, Mr Selfridge.    

02:10.538 --> 02:14.875
One begets the other.         
We need to put on a show!        

02:46.365 --> 02:52.538
Mr Grove, could I come and speak    
to you for five minutes later on?    

02:52.538 --> 02:54.331
About?                 

02:54.331 --> 02:56.709
Er...private matters, Mr Grove.    

02:56.709 --> 03:00.713
You can come up at 11:00        
if Miss Mardle will release you.     

03:00.713 --> 03:02.715
Of course.               

03:02.715 --> 03:05.176
Thank you, Mr Grove.          

03:05.176 --> 03:08.304
Back to work, Miss Towler.       

03:08.304 --> 03:10.181
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.      
Good morning.              

03:10.181 --> 03:12.057
Morning, sir.             
Good morning.              

03:12.057 --> 03:14.727
I was hoping we could go over     
the figures this morning.        

03:14.727 --> 03:17.229
Not now, Crabb.            
My staff expect to see me.        

03:17.229 --> 03:19.315
People, not figures,          
are the difference            

03:19.315 --> 03:21.317
between success and failure.      

03:21.317 --> 03:23.194
I thought profit            
had more to do with it.         

03:23.194 --> 03:24.904
We're still not breaking even.     

03:24.904 --> 03:27.072
We have a little problem,       
Mr Selfridge.              

03:27.072 --> 03:28.657
Hold your nerve, Crabb.        

03:32.620 --> 03:35.164
Miss Love.               
Harry.                  

03:35.164 --> 03:38.209
Look at these pictures         
they've taken of me.           

03:38.209 --> 03:40.461
They're just terrible.         

03:40.461 --> 03:43.339
I can't allow my public        
to see me like this.           

03:43.339 --> 03:45.591
They're positively Victorian.     

03:45.591 --> 03:48.260
Miss Love, I see no problem      
with these photographs.         

03:48.260 --> 03:51.388
They convey exactly the message    
I was asking for.            

03:51.388 --> 03:54.600
Then you must have           
got the message wrong.          

03:54.600 --> 03:58.938
Look at them, Harry.          
They're dreary, really, aren't they? 

03:58.938 --> 04:01.398
This can't be             
the Spirit of Selfridges.        

04:01.398 --> 04:04.527
This is first class work,       
Mr Selfridge.              

04:04.527 --> 04:07.613
But nothing we offer          
seems to strike her right.        

04:07.613 --> 04:10.241
It's your decision.          

04:15.996 --> 04:20.084
Do them again and do them better.   
If Miss Love isn't satisfied,      

04:20.084 --> 04:22.127
we're not satisfied.          

04:22.127 --> 04:23.963
Thank you, Harry.           

04:23.963 --> 04:27.842
You will come back and take me to   
lunch, won't you? Of course I will.  

04:29.385 --> 04:32.721
A bientot.               
A bientot.                

04:52.616 --> 04:55.244
Miss Towler. Follow me.        

05:04.170 --> 05:06.672
Thank you for seeing me, Mr Grove.  

05:09.717 --> 05:14.930
So, I think you should tell me     
what this is all about.         

05:14.930 --> 05:21.478
Erm...well, it's about my brother,  
Mr Grove. My brother George.       

05:21.478 --> 05:26.233
I was hoping you might be able to   
find a position for him.         

05:26.233 --> 05:30.321
I see. And what has your brother    
to recommend him?            

05:30.321 --> 05:36.035
Well, he wouldn't want         
anything skilled, Mr Grove,       

05:36.035 --> 05:40.748
but he's ever such a hard worker    
and eager to please.           

05:40.748 --> 05:44.668
I just thought with Mr Selfridge    
hiring a lot of new staff,        

05:44.668 --> 05:47.505
there might be something here     
for him.                 

05:50.257 --> 05:52.927
And what if I said           
I have nothing to offer him?       

05:55.012 --> 05:58.474
Well, I should be very disappointed,
Mr Grove.                

06:00.017 --> 06:02.436
And that's all.            

06:02.436 --> 06:05.439
I don't understand.          
Yes, I think you do.           

06:10.528 --> 06:14.198
Discretion is something we value    
at Selfridges.              

06:14.198 --> 06:18.744
I like to think that I can count on 
your discretion, Miss Towler.      

06:18.744 --> 06:22.164
Well, yes. Of... Of course.      

06:23.916 --> 06:26.919
We all like to             
keep some things private.        

06:29.046 --> 06:33.634
Well, I think I might be able to    
offer your brother a porter's job    

06:33.634 --> 06:37.096
in the loading bay, subject to     
a satisfactory trial period.       

06:37.096 --> 06:39.348
Oh, Mr Grove! Thank you.        
Thank you so much.            

06:40.891 --> 06:43.769
Sorry.                 
It's all right, Miss Towler.       

06:43.769 --> 06:45.729
Time to return to your post.      

06:47.815 --> 06:51.777
Let discretion be your watchword.   
Yes, Mr Grove.              

06:53.529 --> 06:56.323
Oh, Miss Towler?            
Yes, Mr Grove?              

06:56.323 --> 06:59.827
I hope you haven't any more brothers
at home wanting jobs.          

06:59.827 --> 07:01.787
(LAUGHS)                

07:01.787 --> 07:04.832
No, Mr Grove. Thank you Mr Grove.   

07:13.424 --> 07:16.343
Hello, hello. Fancy meeting you.    

07:16.343 --> 07:18.345
What are you looking so happy about?

07:18.345 --> 07:20.556
Mr Grove's               
going to give George a job.       

07:20.556 --> 07:23.392
Huh. How did you persuade him     
to do that, then?            

07:23.392 --> 07:25.477
Did you have to give him a kiss?    
Course not!               

07:25.477 --> 07:27.855
If it was me, I'd have         
insisted on a kiss at least.       

07:27.855 --> 07:29.940
Good job you're not him, then.     

07:36.030 --> 07:39.408
Fraser. There you are.         
Oh, Apologies, Ma'am.            

07:39.408 --> 07:41.619
I didn't realise you were going out.

07:42.661 --> 07:46.332
Lady Loxley was rather insistent.   

07:47.875 --> 07:50.002
Lady Loxley.              

07:50.002 --> 07:53.297
Call me Lady Mae.           
Everyone else does.           

07:54.590 --> 07:58.469
I've called at a bad time, I think. 
Are you on your way out?         

07:58.469 --> 08:02.223
I was, but it's nothing urgent.    

08:02.223 --> 08:05.851
Uh...Fraser, would you ask       
Mrs Selfridge to join us?        

08:05.851 --> 08:07.811
Certainly, ma'am.           

08:13.651 --> 08:15.694
A word with you, Victor.        

08:18.155 --> 08:20.574
Do you know              
how you got this position?        

08:20.574 --> 08:26.539
Well, I am an experienced waiter,   
sir. Good references.          

08:31.001 --> 08:33.254
And?                  

08:38.424 --> 08:43.514
You're a very...            
attractive young man, Victor.      

08:43.514 --> 08:46.392
The ladies like that.         

08:46.392 --> 08:50.271
That's going to be a great part    
of their pleasure in coming here.    

08:50.271 --> 08:52.857
And not just the pretty ones,     
Victor.                 

08:52.857 --> 08:57.111
The old ones, the fat ones,      
the neglected ones,           

08:57.111 --> 09:00.823
the ones with husbands         
that can't satisfy them.         

09:00.823 --> 09:07.788
We want them to come back again    
and again and to be made happy.     

09:07.788 --> 09:10.082
I think I can do that, sir.      

09:10.082 --> 09:11.917
I think you can.            

09:11.917 --> 09:14.128
Make sure               
those glasses are spotless.       

09:14.128 --> 09:16.213
Yes, Mr Perez.             

09:23.637 --> 09:27.683
I just called to see          
how you were all settling in.      

09:27.683 --> 09:31.103
I suppose you must be neglected    
with Harry -               

09:31.103 --> 09:33.856
with Mr Selfridge           
so busy at the store.          

09:33.856 --> 09:37.026
Oh, we're used to it, Lady Mae.    
And we don't feel neglected.       

09:37.026 --> 09:39.236
And have you met Miss Love,      

09:39.236 --> 09:42.448
the Spirit of Selfridges,       
as they call her?            

09:42.448 --> 09:45.201
Yes, at the opening.          
I thought she was quite charming.    

09:45.201 --> 09:49.288
Yes, yes she does charm people.    

09:49.288 --> 09:54.293
Men especially. One could say     
that's rather her thing.         

09:54.293 --> 09:57.796
It's all terribly exciting,      
isn't it -                

09:57.796 --> 10:00.674
this great new store and all      
the people who are drawn into it?    

10:00.674 --> 10:03.302
So many exciting possibilities.    

10:03.302 --> 10:06.805
New ideas, new friendships.      

10:08.140 --> 10:10.601
Perhaps I should go there       
more often.               

10:10.601 --> 10:14.021
Yes, perhaps you should.        

10:14.021 --> 10:17.274
But perhaps you were          
about to go there as I arrived.     

10:17.274 --> 10:20.277
Actually, I was thinking of      
going to the National Gallery.      

10:20.277 --> 10:22.321
The National Gallery?         

10:22.321 --> 10:24.532
My dear, no-one goes there       
on public days.             

10:24.532 --> 10:28.577
It's full of all sorts of riff-raff.
But the paintings are the same,     

10:28.577 --> 10:31.372
aren't they,              
whoever's there to look at them?     

10:32.790 --> 10:34.875
What an original point of view.    

10:36.043 --> 10:38.254
I'll get you a cab, Mrs Selfridge.  

10:38.254 --> 10:41.674
No, please. Let me give you a lift. 

10:41.674 --> 10:43.676
My motorcar's just outside.      

10:43.676 --> 10:46.762
Oh, thank you, but I thought      
I'd try the underground.         

10:52.601 --> 10:54.728
MAN: Where to, love?          
Trafalgar Square.            

11:38.731 --> 11:43.360
This is so sweet of you.        
I know how busy you are.         

11:43.360 --> 11:46.071
Well, you know, I'll always find time
for you, Ellen.             

11:46.071 --> 11:48.532
Thank you for this morning.      

11:48.532 --> 11:53.078
Perhaps I was wrong          
to make such a fuss,           

11:53.078 --> 11:55.831
but the Spirit of Selfridges      

11:55.831 --> 11:59.668
should be something really special, 
shouldn't it? You've got it, Ellen.  

11:59.668 --> 12:04.048
That is my idea exactly.        
Selfridges - modernity, the future.   

12:04.048 --> 12:06.717
Changing the way            
people see the world.          

12:06.717 --> 12:11.263
The thing is, we have to find more   
and more new ways of saying that.    

12:11.263 --> 12:13.265
But you are pleased with me?      

12:13.265 --> 12:17.311
Of course I'm pleased with you.    
Very pleased with you.          

12:17.311 --> 12:19.813
Oh, that means so much to me, Harry.

12:19.813 --> 12:24.443
Because, you know, I'm still      
a little bit afraid of you.       

12:24.443 --> 12:26.278
Afraid of me? And why is that?     

12:26.278 --> 12:32.243
You're so decisive.          
You're such a dynamo of energy.     

12:32.243 --> 12:35.496
Hmm.                  
You don't care about danger.       

12:35.496 --> 12:38.165
You just take a leap         
into the unknown             

12:38.165 --> 12:40.125
and devil take the consequences.    

12:41.585 --> 12:47.758
In your own way, you're as much of  
a daredevil as that crazy Frenchman  

12:47.758 --> 12:51.720
who's trying to fly the Channel.    
Say that again.             

12:51.720 --> 12:54.306
You know, the one           
they're all talking about.        

12:54.306 --> 12:57.726
Blareo or... What I had in mind -   
I've got to go. What?          

12:57.726 --> 12:59.854
Mr Perez,               
get Frank Edwards on the phone.     

12:59.854 --> 13:02.523
I'm sorry, I've got to dash.      
I'll catch you later.          

13:08.237 --> 13:10.614
Not a word to anyone.         
It's all very hush-hush.         

13:10.614 --> 13:13.325
Mr Grove, I need you to        
get hold of the Commissioner.      

13:13.325 --> 13:15.619
Tell him we need 12 bobbies      
standing guard -             

13:15.619 --> 13:19.456
very good for publicity.        
Mr Crabb, call the insurance company  

13:19.456 --> 13:22.918
and tell them to increase liability  
by 10,000 - it's very valuable.     

13:22.918 --> 13:25.421
Should I explain to them        
what it is we're insuring?        

13:25.421 --> 13:28.048
No. Not a word to anyone.       
Any more questions? Good.        

13:28.048 --> 13:31.468
I'll be gone for the rest of the day.
May I ask, what about the windows?   

13:31.468 --> 13:33.012
Think birds, Henri!          

13:37.099 --> 13:39.393
You know he's signed a deal      
with the Daily Mail?           

13:39.393 --> 13:42.146
We'll get in on it.          
How well do you know Northcliffe?    

13:42.146 --> 13:45.024
We started out together.        
He and I go way back.          

13:45.024 --> 13:47.151
Long before he owned the Mail.     
That's good.               

13:47.151 --> 13:48.986
Anyway, we're not stealing from him. 

13:48.986 --> 13:51.822
We're helping him           
to double his circulation.        

13:51.822 --> 13:58.078
If we get it right, he wins, we win, 
everybody wins!             

14:00.164 --> 14:02.249
Yes, of course, madam.         

14:09.256 --> 14:11.383
Was everything satisfactory, madam? 

14:11.383 --> 14:14.845
Yes. Especially the service.      

14:14.845 --> 14:17.014
Thank you, madam.           

14:17.014 --> 14:18.849
Come here.               

14:20.559 --> 14:22.811
This is for you.            

14:22.811 --> 14:25.940
Thank you, madam.           
You're too generous.           

14:25.940 --> 14:27.733
May I know your name?         

14:27.733 --> 14:30.110
Victor, madam.             

14:30.110 --> 14:32.196
Victor.                

14:33.656 --> 14:36.200
That's a lovely name.         

14:37.535 --> 14:40.996
Victor, I'm thinking of having     
a little party              

14:40.996 --> 14:43.040
tomorrow evening at 8:00.       

14:43.040 --> 14:47.378
Only a few friends, but it would be 
nice to have a first class waiter    

14:47.378 --> 14:49.088
to look after us.           

14:49.088 --> 14:53.259
I wonder, do you ever         
do evening work like that?        

14:54.385 --> 14:57.221
I am free tomorrow evening, madam.  

14:57.221 --> 14:59.598
Oh, good.               

14:59.598 --> 15:02.601
Here's my card with the address.    

15:04.353 --> 15:08.023
And if you could come...        
just as you are?             

15:08.023 --> 15:10.109
Of course, madam.           

15:17.908 --> 15:19.827
Until then.              

15:58.157 --> 16:00.117
It's wonderful, isn't it?       

16:01.911 --> 16:04.246
One of the best things they have.   

16:04.246 --> 16:07.500
What it must be            
to be able to paint like that.      

16:09.543 --> 16:11.837
Yes.                  

16:11.837 --> 16:16.300
And so unusual in a work of art -   
to see a man laid low by a woman.    

16:19.637 --> 16:22.056
Do I detect an American accent?    

16:22.056 --> 16:24.225
Yes. Yes, you do.           

16:24.225 --> 16:29.271
Are you in London on holiday?     
Doing Europe, as they say?        

16:29.271 --> 16:31.565
Yes. Yes, I am.            

16:34.401 --> 16:36.779
We should...              
We should introduce ourselves.      

16:36.779 --> 16:40.449
I'm Roderick Temple. I'm a painter. 

16:40.449 --> 16:42.576
Rosalie Buckingham.          

16:48.415 --> 16:52.044
Er...look, I hope you don't mind,   

16:52.044 --> 16:55.256
but erm...I was sketching you     
just now.                

16:55.256 --> 16:57.049
Why would you do that?         

16:58.467 --> 17:01.679
You have this extraordinary quality 
of stillness about you          

17:01.679 --> 17:04.557
and I wanted to capture it.      

17:12.189 --> 17:14.942
So you're a realist painter?      

17:14.942 --> 17:17.778
No, no. More of a romantic, really. 

17:17.778 --> 17:20.030
Oh.                  

17:20.030 --> 17:22.616
This is probably going to sound    
quite pretentious,            

17:22.616 --> 17:27.037
but my aim is to capture        
the inner beauty             

17:27.037 --> 17:29.498
and the the mystery of life      
through the human form.         

17:31.625 --> 17:36.380
Yes, that does sound pretentious,   
doesn't it? I'm sorry.          

17:36.380 --> 17:39.383
No, no, not at all. Not to me.     

17:40.843 --> 17:44.388
Do you paint yourself?         
Years ago, before I was...        

17:44.388 --> 17:46.849
Um...when I was at college.      

17:48.684 --> 17:52.730
Look, I know this sounds        
quite cheeky, erm...           

17:54.273 --> 17:57.067
..but my studio's just the       
other side of Charing Cross Road     

17:57.067 --> 17:59.320
and I'd love to show you        
some of my work             

17:59.320 --> 18:02.031
and see what you think of it.     

18:24.637 --> 18:27.014
Can I help you, sir?          
I don't know, my dear.          

18:27.014 --> 18:29.308
There are those            
who say I'm beyond help.         

18:30.768 --> 18:33.103
Tell me, what do you think?      

18:33.103 --> 18:36.106
I'm sure I don't know.         
Well, I'll tell you what it is.     

18:36.106 --> 18:39.235
I'm looking for something       
for my best girl for her birthday.   

18:39.235 --> 18:43.155
Nothing too dear            
because I'm not a rich man,       

18:43.155 --> 18:47.660
but something nice,          
something dainty.            

18:47.660 --> 18:50.204
After all, it's the thought      
that counts, isn't it?          

18:50.204 --> 18:52.122
I suppose it is, yes.         

18:52.122 --> 18:56.126
Well, how's about you help me     
choose something, then?         

18:56.126 --> 18:58.879
I mean, what would you choose     
if it was to be for you?         

18:58.879 --> 19:01.882
Something to match those        
beautiful blue eyes of yours?      

19:01.882 --> 19:04.885
It's all right, Kitty.         
I'll take care of this customer.     

19:09.098 --> 19:10.850
What are you doing here?        

19:12.309 --> 19:14.812
You're not ashamed of me, are you?  

19:14.812 --> 19:18.482
Agnes, I came here to see you.     
Not to cause trouble.          

19:18.482 --> 19:20.401
You cause trouble wherever you go.  

19:20.401 --> 19:23.696
You've got yourself          
a lovely situation here, my girl.    

19:23.696 --> 19:25.614
Please don't ruin it for me.      

19:25.614 --> 19:28.284
Why would I want to go and do     
a thing like that?            

19:29.994 --> 19:32.788
Look, Aggie,              

19:32.788 --> 19:36.625
I know I been at fault         
in the past...              

19:38.544 --> 19:41.463
..but I'm...I'm a changed man.     

19:43.215 --> 19:45.593
Look at me.              

19:45.593 --> 19:50.097
Aggie, I want to make amends.     

19:53.267 --> 19:55.603
I can't talk to you here.       

19:57.229 --> 20:01.108
I've got a break in half an hour.   
There's a teashop by Duke Street.    

20:02.693 --> 20:07.615
That's all I wanted -         
the chance to make it up to you.     

20:14.788 --> 20:19.210
Your sister was very persuasive.    
Quite a remarkable young lady.      

20:19.210 --> 20:21.795
Oh, she is, sir.            
I think the world of her.        

20:21.795 --> 20:23.547
I don't know where I'd be       
without her.               

20:23.547 --> 20:25.508
You're a lucky man, then.       
Right, here we are.           

20:25.508 --> 20:28.469
Quite straightforward.        
Unloading the vans coming in,      

20:28.469 --> 20:32.139
loading the vans going out.      
An extra man for you, just starting. 

20:32.139 --> 20:35.100
Go easy on him while he's learning. 
George Towler's his name.        

20:35.100 --> 20:37.895
Hello.                 
Alf. Sam.                

20:37.895 --> 20:41.524
I'll leave you to it, George.     
These men will show you the ropes.   

20:41.524 --> 20:44.693
George, is it?             
That's right.              

20:44.693 --> 20:49.031
Come on then, George.         
Let's see what you can do.        

20:52.117 --> 20:54.787
Just for a while,           
till I get back on my feet.       

20:54.787 --> 20:56.497
You said you were on your feet.    

20:56.497 --> 20:59.333
I am. It's just I don't get paid    
till the end of the month -       

20:59.333 --> 21:01.961
Dad, do you remember          
why we moved out?            

21:01.961 --> 21:04.672
Why we said we could          
never live with you again?        

21:04.672 --> 21:07.675
Of course I do.            
There isn't a day goes by        

21:07.675 --> 21:09.385
where I don't think about that.    

21:09.385 --> 21:11.595
It haunt's me.             
But I'm a different man.         

21:11.595 --> 21:15.766
Look at me. I'm off the drink, got  
colour in my cheeks. Look at that.   

21:15.766 --> 21:19.728
Steady as a rock.           
I haven't had a drop for two months. 

21:20.938 --> 21:22.773
What is this job?           

21:22.773 --> 21:25.693
Hotel work.              
I got good prospects there, girl.    

21:25.693 --> 21:27.486
Me and the manager, like that.     

21:27.486 --> 21:31.240
I'm his right hand man.        
So why doesn't he let you live in?   

21:31.240 --> 21:33.325
Well, probation.            

21:33.325 --> 21:35.578
I will do, end of the month.      

21:35.578 --> 21:39.498
I just want a chance          
to make it up to you and George.     

21:40.666 --> 21:44.503
Come on, girl.             
You can't deny your old man that.    

21:45.713 --> 21:48.799
You are my only daughter. Want me   
to beg, I'll get on my knees.      

21:48.799 --> 21:52.678
I'll beg. Here, I'm going to beg.   
Dad, stop it! (LAUGHS)          

22:00.019 --> 22:02.521
Just till the end of the month.    

22:02.521 --> 22:07.443
And if you raise your hand just once
to me or to George...          

22:07.443 --> 22:10.404
Never again, as long as I live.    

22:10.404 --> 22:12.531
I swear.                

22:15.159 --> 22:18.078
All right, then.            
You're an angel, girl. An angel.     

22:20.789 --> 22:22.917
Suit yourself.             

22:30.508 --> 22:33.427
All right, George. You ready?     
I'm ready.                

22:33.427 --> 22:35.804
Good boy.               

22:35.804 --> 22:39.391
Hold steady now. Careful, careful.  

22:39.391 --> 22:41.477
There we are. You've got it, son.   

22:41.477 --> 22:44.104
Now see if you can walk with it.    

22:44.104 --> 22:47.775
Not bad, not bad.           

22:47.775 --> 22:49.818
Ah, come on, Alf. Fair dos.      

22:49.818 --> 22:52.404
Oh, he loves it, don't you, George? 

22:52.404 --> 22:55.199
Careful. Careful!           

22:56.534 --> 22:58.244
Oh, dear.               

22:59.245 --> 23:02.248
You need to build yourself up,     
George, if you want to work here.    

23:02.248 --> 23:04.375
I nearly done it though, didn't I?  

23:04.375 --> 23:06.460
Ah, you got to love him,        
haven't you?               

23:06.460 --> 23:11.131
Yes, George, you nearly done it.    
Come over here.             

23:13.008 --> 23:15.261
You're one of us now, George.     

23:15.261 --> 23:17.096
Right, what's this?          

23:19.640 --> 23:22.393
Four thousand silk scarves.      

23:26.939 --> 23:29.483
Four thousand silk scarves?      

23:29.483 --> 23:32.987
Yes. Tomorrow is going to be      
a special day.              

23:32.987 --> 23:35.030
Everything has to be perfect.     

23:35.030 --> 23:38.784
But what's it about, Miss Mardle?   
Ah. My lips are sealed.         

23:38.784 --> 23:40.995
But it's something           
quite extraordinary.           

24:02.391 --> 24:04.518
Let's get after him!          

24:34.124 --> 24:36.126
Sorry.                 

24:43.299 --> 24:45.051
It's stuffy in here.          

24:51.474 --> 24:55.854
I suppose they're a bit traditional 
for your taste. Not at all.       

25:00.442 --> 25:02.444
They're excellent.           

25:07.031 --> 25:09.117
Thank you.               

25:13.872 --> 25:16.124
God, you're beautiful.         

25:20.628 --> 25:22.505
I'm...                 

25:22.505 --> 25:26.843
I didn't come here for that.      
I'm a married woman, Mr Temple.     

25:26.843 --> 25:28.678
Oh. I'm so sorry.           

25:28.678 --> 25:30.472
Erm...                 

25:30.472 --> 25:32.932
Look, please forgive me.        
I didn't mean to...           

25:32.932 --> 25:35.643
I um...should probably go.       

25:35.643 --> 25:37.771
No! No, no, no, no.          
Please, please don't.          

25:37.771 --> 25:39.856
Maybe it was my fault         
for coming here. No.           

25:39.856 --> 25:41.941
It's my fault entirely.        

25:41.941 --> 25:45.904
Can we just forget           
that just happened and start again?  

25:45.904 --> 25:47.989
It's out of the question.       
Goodbye, Mr Temple.           

26:03.671 --> 26:05.423
Victor?                

26:10.512 --> 26:12.389
For you.                

26:20.438 --> 26:26.403
I don't get it. What's she doing -  
sending chocolates to the waiter?    

26:26.403 --> 26:28.488
Let's have a look.           

26:29.948 --> 26:32.784
READS: So looking forward       
to our little party tomorrow.      

26:32.784 --> 26:35.453
My chauffeur              
will call for you at 6:30.        

26:35.453 --> 26:37.288
Lillian Worthington.          

26:39.874 --> 26:42.210
Haven't you twigged it, Victor?    

26:42.210 --> 26:46.172
This little party's going to be    
just for you and the lady.        

26:46.172 --> 26:48.299
Oh. Right.               

26:50.385 --> 26:52.804
And you think I should go?       

26:52.804 --> 26:55.557
Always strive             
to please the customer, Victor.     

26:55.557 --> 26:57.308
That's what you're there for.     

26:57.308 --> 27:00.603
When I was your age,          
I had many such assignations.      

27:00.603 --> 27:04.065
Enjoy yourself.            
You're only young once.         

27:05.400 --> 27:07.360
Thanks, Mr Perez.           

27:13.825 --> 27:16.911
Make way!               
Welcome!                 

27:16.911 --> 27:21.082
Mr Bleriot, a great achievement!    
Welcome to England.           

27:21.082 --> 27:23.168
The first man to fly the Channel.   

27:23.168 --> 27:26.921
Who are you, Monsieur?         
This is Harry Gordon Selfridge.     

27:26.921 --> 27:28.965
Selfridges is the greatest store    
in London                

27:28.965 --> 27:33.178
and he's going to give you and     
your aeroplane pride of place in it. 

27:35.555 --> 27:38.183
Excuse me, monsieur, step aside.    

27:38.183 --> 27:40.727
The people want to take photographs 
of me, not you.             

27:40.727 --> 27:44.564
No, no, I understand. You think    
I'm trying to ride your coat tails.   

27:44.564 --> 27:47.025
Listen, give me five minutes.     
Just five minutes.            

27:47.025 --> 27:49.235
That's all I ask.           
If I don't convince you,         

27:49.235 --> 27:51.988
I'll be out of your life forever.   

27:51.988 --> 27:53.823
Three minutes.             

27:59.871 --> 28:02.749
These people don't know        
what they're looking at, but we do.   

28:02.749 --> 28:06.503
This is the future. Folk will be    
popping over the Channel for lunch    

28:06.503 --> 28:09.464
without thinking anything of it.    
All because one man           

28:09.464 --> 28:12.008
had the courage and the daring     
to do it first.             

28:12.008 --> 28:13.968
Let me ask you something.       

28:13.968 --> 28:19.307
What did it feel like to be up there 
in the clouds all alone?         

28:19.307 --> 28:24.145
I thought I was going to die,     
monsieur. That is what I thought.    

28:24.145 --> 28:27.982
How do you say... A squall blew up, 

28:27.982 --> 28:31.569
the clouds came down          
and for ten minutes,           

28:31.569 --> 28:36.616
I could see nothing -         
I was flying blind.           

28:36.616 --> 28:40.578
Flying blind. Go on.          

28:45.166 --> 28:47.627
It was strange.            

28:47.627 --> 28:50.797
The wind was tossing me about     
like a leaf.               

28:50.797 --> 28:54.092
But you know, I was quite calm.    

28:55.802 --> 28:58.722
I was in the hands of fate,      
monsieur.                

29:01.015 --> 29:04.936
And then the clouds cleared      
and I could see a place to land,     

29:04.936 --> 29:08.022
and...here I am.            

29:09.691 --> 29:12.736
That must have been          
one a hell of a feeling -        

29:12.736 --> 29:16.865
totally lost in the empty space.    
Flying blind.              

29:18.366 --> 29:21.202
I know that feeling. I do.       

29:21.202 --> 29:24.372
(CHUCKLES)               
Flying blind.              

29:27.542 --> 29:29.502
We have a deal.            

29:44.726 --> 29:47.937
No! I cannot work like this      
and I will not!             

29:49.355 --> 29:52.192
Monsieur Leclair. Always a pleasure.
How are things going?          

29:52.192 --> 29:55.820
It's over.               
I won't work with that man anymore.  

29:55.820 --> 29:58.823
Henri, what's the matter?       
Simply, I've had enough.         

29:58.823 --> 30:01.117
I come to you,             
you are Chief of Staff.         

30:01.117 --> 30:05.205
I tender my resignation.        
I leave for Paris this evening.     

30:05.205 --> 30:08.500
Henri? Henri!             

30:10.085 --> 30:12.754
Ground floor.             
Henri! Please!              

30:12.754 --> 30:15.006
Henri!                 

30:18.093 --> 30:21.262
Henri... Henri, stop.         

30:22.680 --> 30:24.724
Tell me what happened.         
What happened?              

30:24.724 --> 30:27.394
This morning, he humiliates me     
in front of his mistress         

30:27.394 --> 30:31.564
when he knows I am in the right!    
And now this exhibition I must build 

30:31.564 --> 30:33.858
just to make him look good.      
Well, you know what?           

30:33.858 --> 30:35.610
This time he has gone too far.     

30:35.610 --> 30:37.487
Let him see              
how he gets on without me.        

30:37.487 --> 30:40.782
He's been rough on everyone today.  
You've simply had the worst of it.   

30:40.782 --> 30:43.952
He shows no gratitude,         
no appreciation. But he does.      

30:43.952 --> 30:45.870
You should hear            
the way he talks about you.       

30:45.870 --> 30:48.707
He'll tell anyone you're a genius.  
And you are.               

30:48.707 --> 30:51.376
He should tell it to me.        
I absolutely agree.           

30:51.376 --> 30:53.503
He will, I know it,          
before the end of the day.        

30:53.503 --> 30:56.297
No, he will not, because I will    
not be here. I will be gone.       

30:56.297 --> 30:58.133
Wait, Henri. Wait.           

30:58.133 --> 31:00.301
Wait until you've calmed down     
a little.                

31:00.301 --> 31:02.637
Sleep on it. Would you do that?    

31:02.637 --> 31:06.975
For me. Because I'd hate to lose    
a brilliant colleague and friend.    

31:13.231 --> 31:16.860
All right. For you.          
I will wait until tomorrow.       

31:21.781 --> 31:24.993
Now, you've got to           
pay attention, George,          

31:24.993 --> 31:29.581
because I'm going to tell you     
about the special deliveries.      

31:29.581 --> 31:31.541
Is this a joke again?         

31:31.541 --> 31:35.253
No, no, no, no.            
This one is deadly serious.       

31:37.005 --> 31:40.133
Mostly the goods            
go in the green vans,          

31:40.133 --> 31:45.513
but every so often the blue van    
comes in for the specials.        

31:45.513 --> 31:49.142
So if  I say to you          
'special delivery' or 'special',     

31:49.142 --> 31:51.978
you put it in the blue van.      

31:51.978 --> 31:54.355
Cos it'll be for            
urgent express delivery,         

31:54.355 --> 31:57.692
probably for one of the directors   
or such like.              

31:57.692 --> 31:59.486
And they like to keep it private,   

31:59.486 --> 32:03.198
so we don't tell no-one        
about the specials. Understand?     

32:04.824 --> 32:08.495
I'm trusting you now, George.     
I can trust you, can't I?        

32:08.495 --> 32:11.081
Yeah, you can trust me, Alf.      

32:11.081 --> 32:14.459
Good boy.               
Well, that's your first day done.    

32:14.459 --> 32:18.129
See you tomorrow,           
eight o'clock sharp.           

32:32.268 --> 32:34.312
Carry on, ladies.           

32:41.194 --> 32:43.321
Oh, you gave me a fright!       

32:43.321 --> 32:45.156
How's my best girl, then?       

32:45.156 --> 32:48.910
Busy. And I'm not your best girl.   
You know we're not supposed to...    

32:48.910 --> 32:52.122
Come on. I thought we might      
have a cup of tea together        

32:52.122 --> 32:54.958
when they let you go.         
No, not tonight.             

32:54.958 --> 32:57.836
I've got to get home.         
What for?                

32:57.836 --> 33:00.213
Family business. Private.       

33:00.213 --> 33:03.174
All right. Another night then, eh?  

33:03.174 --> 33:05.260
Maybe.                 

33:08.930 --> 33:13.810
Oh, Victor! You shouldn't have.    
They must have cost an awful lot.    

33:13.810 --> 33:17.313
Well, they would have         
if I'd paid for them.          

33:17.313 --> 33:21.359
You stole them?            
Perk of the job, you might say.     

33:21.359 --> 33:23.987
Shame you'll have to eat them     
on your own now.             

33:25.155 --> 33:29.409
And next time             
I won't take no for an answer.      

33:29.409 --> 33:31.745
Night.                

33:34.122 --> 33:36.416
Ladies.                

33:36.416 --> 33:39.252
Ooh, Agnes.              

33:39.252 --> 33:42.297
I really think he's sweet on you.   

33:42.297 --> 33:44.632
I wouldn't let him go if I were you.

33:44.632 --> 33:48.344
He's got lovely big brown eyes.    
And lovely long legs.          

33:48.344 --> 33:50.638
Bet he's got strong arms, too.     

33:50.638 --> 33:54.017
Give you a lovely squeeze, he could.

33:54.017 --> 33:56.811
Come on, Agnes,            
give us one of your chocs.        

33:56.811 --> 34:00.523
(GASPS)                
Truffles! My favourite.         

34:00.523 --> 34:04.360
Kitty, you've got such a cheek!    

34:04.360 --> 34:08.656
Calais - Dover - Selfridges.      
That's the headline.           

34:08.656 --> 34:11.868
The Bleriot aeroplane,         
which flew the Channel yesterday,    

34:11.868 --> 34:15.496
is on view, free of charge,      
on our ground floor.           

34:15.496 --> 34:20.251
The public is invited to see      
this wonderful epoch-making machine.  

34:20.251 --> 34:23.004
We want it in all the papers.     
Go to it.                

34:35.391 --> 34:38.353
I was afraid              
we'd miss our Tuesday night,       

34:38.353 --> 34:40.772
what with the chief          
working us so late.           

34:44.525 --> 34:46.569
That's good.              

34:47.987 --> 34:50.239
I'm still worried about Miss Towler.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.701
I think we can trust her.       

34:53.993 --> 34:56.413
Strange little thing, isn't she?    

34:56.413 --> 34:58.915
You'd think butter wouldn't melt    
in her mouth,              

34:58.915 --> 35:03.545
but I reckon she knows the score.   
If she keeps her mouth shut,       

35:03.545 --> 35:06.339
her brother has a nice little job   
in the loading bay.           

35:06.339 --> 35:09.175
If it were to come out,        
we'd both lose our jobs.         

35:09.175 --> 35:13.888
I keep thinking she'll follow you   
home one day and tell your wife.     

35:13.888 --> 35:16.224
Oh, my God, don't say that.      
She wouldn't do that.          

35:16.224 --> 35:18.184
What could she possibly gain      
by that?                 

35:19.769 --> 35:23.440
Anyway, let's not allow her      
to ruin our evening.           

35:23.440 --> 35:26.359
This is about you and me.       
No-one else.               

35:26.359 --> 35:32.407
Oh, Roger, I do live for        
these precious hours together.      

35:32.407 --> 35:34.534
My darling Josie.           

35:39.622 --> 35:42.751
Be careful!              
This machine is worth a fortune.     

35:44.085 --> 35:46.963
(TO HIMSELF) What a piece of junk.  
Piece of junk?              

35:46.963 --> 35:50.592
This is the work of genius -      
a French genius -            

35:50.592 --> 35:54.262
displayed by our very own       
French genius.              

35:54.262 --> 35:57.223
You are being very forthcoming     
with your compliments.          

35:57.223 --> 35:59.768
I presume you have spoken to      
Mr Grove.                

35:59.768 --> 36:03.938
I've come to say sorry.        
I have treated you abominably.      

36:03.938 --> 36:06.733
Yes, you did. And you will again,   
no doubt, if I stay.           

36:06.733 --> 36:09.194
No-one can spin straw into gold    
like you.                

36:09.194 --> 36:12.739
You're the best. That's why      
I brought you with me from Chicago.   

36:12.739 --> 36:15.492
I know this.              
And you are the best at what you do. 

36:15.492 --> 36:18.244
But one day              
you will push me too far.        

36:18.244 --> 36:20.246
Then you will be sorry.        

36:20.246 --> 36:23.249
Now, if you would please leave me   
to my work.               

36:32.092 --> 36:34.886
There's nothing to worry about,    
George.                 

36:34.886 --> 36:37.931
He's not like he used to be      
and it's only for a few days.      

36:37.931 --> 36:40.517
You said                
we'd never have to see him again.    

36:40.517 --> 36:42.477
Yes, well...              

36:46.856 --> 36:50.235
Here they are -            
the workers of the world.        

36:50.235 --> 36:53.071
All right, Dad?            

36:53.071 --> 36:54.948
They make you work late        
at that place.              

36:54.948 --> 36:58.493
Well, we had to. There's this     
special exhibition coming off.      

36:58.493 --> 37:02.664
I've got a few things in for you,   
so you can do our tea, Aggie.      

37:02.664 --> 37:06.000
Your Mrs Payne             
was very accommodating.         

37:06.000 --> 37:08.670
I think she took quite a fancy     
to me.                  

37:08.670 --> 37:12.090
People often do at first.       

37:12.090 --> 37:14.801
Georgie...               

37:14.801 --> 37:17.721
Georgie, got yourself a job.      

37:17.721 --> 37:21.307
(TAPS CHAIR)              
Wonders will never cease, eh?      

37:21.307 --> 37:24.602
(LAUGHS)                
How was it, son?             

37:24.602 --> 37:28.398
All right.               
They said I was a strong lad.      

37:28.398 --> 37:30.567
Strong lad, is it?           

37:30.567 --> 37:36.239
Here we are. Our little family,    
all together again.           

37:51.838 --> 37:53.590
Who is it?               

37:53.590 --> 37:56.551
Harry.                 
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.    

37:58.344 --> 38:00.263
The day I've had... I tell you.    

38:00.263 --> 38:04.267
I've got your crazy Frenchman's    
flying machine at the store.       

38:04.267 --> 38:08.313
Do you fancy playing the aviatrix   
tomorrow?                

38:10.690 --> 38:13.401
You know I'd do anything for you,   
Harry.                  

38:23.995 --> 38:26.414
So does this mean           
you're taking me flying?         

38:37.842 --> 38:40.387
We can't do it here now -       
someone might come in.          

38:40.387 --> 38:42.430
I don't give a damn.          

38:42.430 --> 38:44.808
(GIGGLES)               

38:48.770 --> 38:51.314
Oh! I beg your pardon.         

38:52.399 --> 38:54.484
Told you so.              

38:59.030 --> 39:00.865
Don't worry. It's only Nancy.     

39:00.865 --> 39:03.993
Who might it be next time?       

39:03.993 --> 39:07.163
(SIGHS)                
Well, we could always go to yours.   

39:09.457 --> 39:12.127
What do you suggest?          

39:14.212 --> 39:16.297
Good night, Ellen.           

39:21.594 --> 39:25.432
MAN: Bleriot in Selfridges!      
Read all about it!            

39:25.432 --> 39:27.308

Bleriot in Selfridges!

Read all about it!           

39:44.242 --> 39:46.661
Here's you change. Thank you.     
Have a nice time.            

39:53.918 --> 39:56.087
(ALL GASP)               

39:56.087 --> 39:58.339
Wow!                 
That is so amazing!           

40:02.635 --> 40:05.638
I'm sorry that you haven't       
seen much of me the last few days.    

40:05.638 --> 40:08.558
Did you see any art?          
I did. Yes.               

40:08.558 --> 40:10.977
Any good?               
I thought so, yes.            

40:10.977 --> 40:13.521
I don't think you'd have liked it   
as much as I did.            

40:13.521 --> 40:16.733
No? But you enjoyed it, though?    

40:16.733 --> 40:20.236
Yes, I enjoyed it. Very much.     

40:20.236 --> 40:23.656
Mrs Selfridge. Mr Selfridge.      
So what do you think now, Crabb?     

40:23.656 --> 40:25.992
A very impressive achievement,     
Mr Selfridge.              

40:25.992 --> 40:27.869
Harrods and the rest of them      
must be empty.              

40:27.869 --> 40:31.122
Because the entire world        
is at Selfridges.            

40:49.432 --> 40:53.103
Ladies and gentlemen,         
I am proud to present,          

40:53.103 --> 40:56.022
here exclusively at Selfridges,    

40:56.022 --> 40:59.275
the daredevil pilot,          
conqueror of the air,          

40:59.275 --> 41:03.446
the human bird,            
Monsieur Louis Bleriot!         

41:10.745 --> 41:12.914
Thank you. Thank you.         

41:12.914 --> 41:17.502
It is a great honour to be here    
with you... Mrs Selfridge?        

41:17.502 --> 41:19.754
Lady Mae.               

41:19.754 --> 41:22.966
Isn't this all quite delightful?    

41:22.966 --> 41:24.843
Miss Ellen Love!            

41:24.843 --> 41:28.054
The Spirit of Selfridges        
is quite the thing.           

41:28.054 --> 41:31.641
Doesn't she look ravishing,      
draped over that contraption?      

41:31.641 --> 41:34.811
Your husband              
seems to think so anyway.        

41:34.811 --> 41:37.313
I'm sure we all think so, Lady Mae. 

41:37.313 --> 41:39.524
Harry, it's a triumph.         

41:39.524 --> 41:41.943
Mr Selfridge,             
you're the talk of the town.       

41:41.943 --> 41:43.820
That's what I aim for.         

41:43.820 --> 41:47.866
It's so thrilling           
to be involved in it all.        

41:47.866 --> 41:50.410
Do you go boating, Mr Selfridge?    

41:50.410 --> 41:55.290
You know, the gentleman rows      
and the lady holds the tiller?      

41:56.791 --> 41:59.085
It's just a little bit of steering. 

42:00.587 --> 42:05.842
Can I have a suit, Mae?        
Yes, Tony. You can have a suit.     

42:08.636 --> 42:11.473
Harry, I'm sorry,           
I'm feeling a little tired.       

42:11.473 --> 42:14.017
I think I'll just slip away.      
What's the matter, Rose?         

42:14.017 --> 42:16.144
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.    
Then stay.                

42:16.144 --> 42:18.563
I need to share this with you.     
I'll see you at home.          

42:18.563 --> 42:20.982
Rose, don't go.            

42:50.970 --> 42:53.973
Hello, Victor.             

42:53.973 --> 42:58.103
I thought I'd come and collect you  
myself. Do jump in.           

42:58.103 --> 43:00.980
I'm sorry, madam, to let you down,  

43:00.980 --> 43:04.192
but I can't be with you        
this evening.              

43:04.192 --> 43:09.614
I checked with my boss         
and it's against company policy.     

43:10.949 --> 43:12.992
Sorry again.              

43:12.992 --> 43:15.120
Good night.              

43:33.596 --> 43:35.557
Meet the great man, then, did you?  

43:35.557 --> 43:37.767
What a saint that man is.       

43:37.767 --> 43:41.730
And how fortunate you both are     
to be wage slaves            

43:41.730 --> 43:43.565
in his grand emporium (!)       

43:45.400 --> 43:49.320
Well, we do think we're quite lucky,
don't we, George?            

43:50.697 --> 43:53.283
Thing is, it's the sort of place    
where you can get on,          

43:53.283 --> 43:54.951
get promoted sort of thing.      

43:54.951 --> 43:59.998
Whereas the sort of place I work,   
you're on a pathway to the gutter.   

43:59.998 --> 44:01.791
Is that what you mean?         

44:01.791 --> 44:05.128
No. You know what I meant.       

44:05.128 --> 44:07.255
What about you, George?        

44:07.255 --> 44:10.550
Are you on a pathway to promotion,  
too, are you?              

44:10.550 --> 44:12.552
I'm a good worker, I am.        

44:12.552 --> 44:15.430
(LAUGHS)                

44:15.430 --> 44:19.017
You're a joke.             
You're a snivelling little halfwit.  

44:19.017 --> 44:21.603
You can't talk to me like that     
no more.                 

44:22.896 --> 44:25.940
Oh, can't I?              

44:28.651 --> 44:30.945
Really?                

44:30.945 --> 44:33.364
What are you going to do about it?  

44:33.364 --> 44:35.867
I'll show you.             

44:37.285 --> 44:39.204
Well, come on, then!          

44:41.081 --> 44:43.416
Stop it! Stop it!           

44:43.416 --> 44:47.253
Only kidding! Only kidding.

(GASPS)                

45:18.326 --> 45:20.870
What is it?              

45:20.870 --> 45:23.164
It's my new home.           

45:25.250 --> 45:27.210
St John's Wood.            

45:27.210 --> 45:30.296
Oh, that's ever so posh!        

45:31.715 --> 45:35.176
All I had to do was give a little   
hint and flutter my eyelashes.      

45:35.176 --> 45:38.555
You had to do more than just that.  
Well, you know what I mean.       

45:50.567 --> 45:53.820
Here's to making history.       
How does it feel?            

45:53.820 --> 45:56.656
Feels good, Frank. Feels great.    

45:57.991 --> 45:59.868
No, that's a lie.           

45:59.868 --> 46:05.081
Now it's all done, it feels like...  
'What was that?'             

46:06.916 --> 46:10.378
You ever felt like           
chucking it all in, Frank?        

46:12.005 --> 46:15.175
Just hurling yourself         
in front of a train?           

46:15.175 --> 46:19.387
Can't say I have, old boy.       
You all right?              

46:21.723 --> 46:25.685
Just a passing thought.        
Just a passing thought.
