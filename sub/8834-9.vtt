This plane is private property.

01:07.375 --> 01:09.750
Who gave you the authority
to rummage around in it?

01:09.834 --> 01:13.291
You're in big trouble, mister.
Where are your credentials?

01:13.500 --> 01:17.125
Read my lips: I am a pirate!

01:17.250 --> 01:19.333
I do not need credentials.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.125
[whispering]

01:21.208 --> 01:22.917
What do you mean you found nothing?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.417
[whispering]

01:24.917 --> 01:27.917
I know what the word "nothing" means.

01:28.083 --> 01:28.959
[crashes]

01:29.041 --> 01:30.166
Where are they, Baloo?

01:30.500 --> 01:31.917
Where are what, Karny?

01:32.041 --> 01:36.875
It is Karnage. Don Karnage!

01:37.000 --> 01:41.083
Just give him the rubies, Baloo,
before he gets angry.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.709
Yes, Baloo, before he gets angry.

01:44.959 --> 01:48.750
What rubies?
You seen any rubies, Kit?

01:48.834 --> 01:51.291
Nope, not me.
No rubies here.

01:51.542 --> 01:54.959
The rubies we're carrying.
Where are they? Tell me! [whimpers]

01:55.041 --> 01:58.000
You must be confused, Miss Cunningham.

01:58.083 --> 02:02.250
We're hauling strawberry jam, not rubies.

02:04.208 --> 02:08.041
Mm-mmm.
Finger-licking good.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.291
Want some?

02:13.709 --> 02:18.667
I do not want any of your sticky jam.
I want--

02:18.750 --> 02:21.125
Hold on.
I'm the owner of Higher for Hire,

02:21.208 --> 02:22.667
and I have a right to know these things.

02:22.750 --> 02:26.166
-Where did you hide the rubies?
-Yes, yes, the rubies! The Rubies!

02:26.250 --> 02:28.375
Tell her so I can eavesdrop.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.583
[clears throat]
Close of Cape Suzette off the port bow.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.917
Is that a shore patrol plane I see?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.583
Shore patrol?
Ahem.

02:38.166 --> 02:41.750
I am feeling forgiving today.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.125
To your ships, men.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.208
Count your blessings.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.083
This time, I do nothing.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.542
But when next we meet,

02:49.959 --> 02:53.875
beware the great pirate, Don Karnage!

02:54.917 --> 02:57.250
Hey-hey, nice call, kid.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.959
Now, let's just strap in.
We're going home.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.375
What happened to the rubies, Baloo, huh?

03:05.458 --> 03:09.542
You never tell me anything.
Like that little accident the other day.

03:09.625 --> 03:12.875
And flying lessons you promised.
And this ruby business.

03:12.959 --> 03:16.417
Not a word to me.
That's going to change when we get back.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.250
Easy, easy, Rebecca.
I'll tell you where the rubies are.

03:21.208 --> 03:24.917
Uh, well, yes. Where?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.792
You aren't going to believe this.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.625
Yoo-hoo, air pirates.
Come on in.

03:31.166 --> 03:36.625
You sure you don't want any
of this delicious strawberry jam?

03:37.041 --> 03:38.208
[Don Karnage] No!

03:38.959 --> 03:42.500
'Cause that's where I hid the rubies!

03:42.583 --> 03:45.792
-In the jam?
-In the jam!

03:45.875 --> 03:48.500
You make me very, very, angry.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.709
[laughing]

03:50.792 --> 03:53.083
Um, I don't think
you should count your pirates

03:53.166 --> 03:57.208
before they're dispatched, Baloo.
We aren't safe in Cape Suzette yet.

03:57.917 --> 04:01.208
Oh, Kit, quit worrying.
I know what I'm doing.

04:01.291 --> 04:03.709
[man on radio] <i>Sea Duck,</i>
<i>this is Cape Suzette Air Control.</i>

04:03.792 --> 04:07.041
[laughs]
See, Kit, I told you we'd make it.

04:07.125 --> 04:08.625
[man on radio]
<i>You have not been cleared for landing.</i>

04:08.709 --> 04:10.125
<i>Please assume holding pattern.</i>

04:10.208 --> 04:15.709
But this is an A-number-one emergency.
We got pirates up the tail pipe.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.875
[man on radio] <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>We have two planes, one glider,</i>

04:17.959 --> 04:19.083
<i>with a blimp ahead of you.</i>

04:19.166 --> 04:20.000
<i>You'll just have to wait.</i>

04:20.083 --> 04:21.709
[Baloo] Air control, come in.

04:21.791 --> 04:22.917
[static]

04:23.041 --> 04:25.792
I can't read you.
There's too much static.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.333
[imitates static]

04:27.625 --> 04:29.625
Air control said to wait.

04:29.709 --> 04:33.083
-We're going in anyway.
-I say we're not!

04:33.166 --> 04:35.083
Six-to-one, they say we do.

04:35.166 --> 04:38.709
Trust me.
I really do know what I'm doing.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.875
Give up, Baloo!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.375
Whoo! Made it!

04:46.458 --> 04:48.750
[Don Karnage]
Mad Dog, go in after him!

04:48.834 --> 04:51.417
Me? Why me?

04:52.667 --> 04:55.875
Send Dumptruck.
Send Hacksaw.

04:55.959 --> 04:58.583
Send in Sadie or Uncle Floyd.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.917
[Rebecca]
You shouldn't be doing this, Baloo.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.875
[Baloo] If you've got a better way
drop be a postcard.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.250
There's still one behind us, skipper.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.166
That's not our biggest problem
at the moment, little britches.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.083
[all yelling]

05:13.583 --> 05:17.417
Or how about... [mutters]
or Thick Blade?

05:18.542 --> 05:21.041
[yelling]

05:22.041 --> 05:25.792
[Baloo] See?
Told ya I knew what I was doin'.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.709
What do you mean
you're taking away my license?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.709
It's only for a week, Mr. Baloo.

05:31.792 --> 05:33.875
But you did enter Cape Suzanne
without permission.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.375
-I told you so.
-Whose side are you on?

05:37.458 --> 05:40.417
What about this big job
you got for us today?

05:40.500 --> 05:44.709
We got paid 50,000 shapoozies up front.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.542
Now what about that?

05:46.792 --> 05:49.917
Hello. I am
Prince Never-Has-Been-Broke.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.583
I need a whole iceberg to be delivered
to my desert palace if you please.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.333
Well, who's going to fly the plane now?

05:59.417 --> 06:01.917
Who's going to fly that iceberg, huh?

06:02.125 --> 06:04.125
You?
[scoffs]

06:04.208 --> 06:07.250
You don't know your elbow
from your aileron.

06:07.333 --> 06:10.250
It just so happens, Mister
I-know-what-I'm-doing.

06:10.333 --> 06:14.083
That with this book,
I can fly any airplane.

06:14.166 --> 06:19.750
See? "Learn to fly any airplane
in three easy lessons."

06:19.834 --> 06:23.083
That book? [laughs]
That's a joke.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.709
Oh, totally wrong-o.

06:25.792 --> 06:27.583
Only an idiot would use it.

06:27.667 --> 06:31.375
That's not what the man
at the bookstore told me, smart guy.

06:31.458 --> 06:34.625
Besides, for $100, it's got to be good.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.500
[Baloo]
You spent 100 smackers on that?

06:37.583 --> 06:42.667
[Rebecca] It comes with a money-back
guarantee and a learner's license.

06:42.750 --> 06:47.208
Only a temporary one,
but it's more than you've got, buster.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.625
-[metal clangs]
-So I don't want to hear another word.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.417
Hey, Baloo,
got that extra equipment loaded.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.250
When do we pull chalks?

06:54.333 --> 06:58.166
Don't ask me, partner.
Ask our new pilot.

06:58.250 --> 07:01.333
Roger Wilcox.
A-okey-dokey.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.458
We're gonna really fly.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.250
Look, Becky, you don't have to do this.

07:09.333 --> 07:14.458
I can still fly.
No one will ever know. Hey!

07:17.000 --> 07:21.625
Uh, right. Like I was saying,
I'll just sit here and help you.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.583
Uh-uh-uh. That's the navigator's seat.

07:24.750 --> 07:25.792
That's me.

07:27.041 --> 07:31.166
Here we are.
Chapter 1: "Welcome to your airplane."

07:31.250 --> 07:33.125
[mumbling]

07:33.208 --> 07:36.041
Oh, no! You don't have
a steering wheel, Baloo!

07:36.125 --> 07:41.834
What? Where? I...
Are you loco? It's right here.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.125
Are you sure?
I don't know, the one in the book is red.

07:44.208 --> 07:48.333
-It's not quite the same shape...
-It's going to be a long flight.

07:48.417 --> 07:52.542
[Rebecca] Chapter Two:
"Take-offs are easy." Let's see.

07:52.959 --> 07:58.625
Take-offs are achieved at exactly
75 miles per hour on a 150-yard runway.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.834
-If you've got 150 yards.
-Which we don't.

08:01.917 --> 08:06.166
Sixty-eight, 69, 70...
Just a few more miles per hour.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.750
[Baloo] Lady, you always say
I don't tell you anything.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.417
Well, I'm telling ya, pull up now!

08:11.500 --> 08:14.000
You keep quiet.
You don't have a license anymore.

08:14.083 --> 08:18.959
I do. So there.
Seventy-two, 73, 74...

08:19.041 --> 08:20.333
[Kit] Baloo!

08:20.417 --> 08:22.667
Look, I don't care what the book says.
We've got to--

08:22.750 --> 08:25.250
-I'm not listening to you.
-But... [yells]

08:25.333 --> 08:29.417
Shush!
There, 75 exactly.

08:32.041 --> 08:35.667
See? Except for a little noise,
a perfect take-off,

08:35.750 --> 08:37.582
just like the book said.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.291
Gee, Baloo, that sure sounded like--

08:40.417 --> 08:43.750
Yeah, I know, Kit. I know.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.542
[Kit] OK, Miss Cunningham,

08:50.625 --> 08:54.291
make a 6-point reverse tack,
come around bearing 4-9er,

08:54.375 --> 08:56.917
and head 78 degrees north.
Got it?

08:57.000 --> 09:01.625
Sure. Uh, just one thing.
Which way's north?

09:01.709 --> 09:04.000
That way, lady, that way.

09:04.083 --> 09:07.667
No need to get huffy, Baloo.
Why not just admit

09:07.750 --> 09:11.083
-I'm doing a good job of flying?
-Because you're not.

09:11.166 --> 09:14.750
You're just envious that
me and my book are doing so well.

09:14.834 --> 09:19.500
That book is a load of guava.
And besides, take-offs are easy.

09:19.583 --> 09:22.000
It's the landings that are hard.

09:22.083 --> 09:27.834
[Kit] At 200 screaming miles per hour,
it can be very hard.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.375
[Rebecca]
Landing, landing... here it is.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.875
Chapter three:
"Landing can be fun."

09:34.959 --> 09:38.333
Look, Rebecca, I was all wrong.

09:38.417 --> 09:42.333
You're doing a bang-up job. Right, Kit?

09:42.417 --> 09:45.041
Uh, right. Great job!

09:45.125 --> 09:47.750
"First, find a spot to land."

09:47.834 --> 09:49.709
She's a natural.

09:49.792 --> 09:52.250
[chuckles]
Still, you know those landings.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.875
Uh, they can be a bit tricky.

09:54.959 --> 09:58.333
[Rebecca]
"Then follow these four simple steps..."

09:58.417 --> 10:02.458
What say, you let me take the controls
and teach you how.

10:02.542 --> 10:06.542
Not on your life.
If I follow the book, I'll land just fine.

10:06.625 --> 10:11.000
If you follow that book,
we'll end up frozen pancakes.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.375
What do you know,
"Mr. No License"?

10:14.458 --> 10:18.333
Where was I? "One: push forward
on the steering wheel."

10:18.417 --> 10:21.875
Oh! No, no!
Pull up! Pull up!

10:21.959 --> 10:23.583
Miss Cunningham!

10:23.667 --> 10:28.000
Ohh! That crazy woman's trying
to get us all snowplowed!

10:28.083 --> 10:30.583
"Two: cut the engines."

10:30.667 --> 10:32.333
[Baloo and Kit]
Don't do that!

10:32.417 --> 10:37.083
[Kit]
Whoa! No!

10:37.166 --> 10:39.875
[Rebecca] Oops! That was step three.

10:41.083 --> 10:43.667
Goodbye, Kit.
It was nice knowing you.

10:43.750 --> 10:47.417
[Rebecca]
Step two is engage landing gear.

10:47.875 --> 10:50.041
[both yelling]

10:50.125 --> 10:53.125
[Rebecca]
And step four... land.

11:05.667 --> 11:09.166
I believe some apologies are in order.

11:09.250 --> 11:13.041
Apologies? Apologies?
Why, why, I, I...

11:13.125 --> 11:14.834
She did get us down, Baloo.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.208
Just like the book said.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.917
"Just like the book said."

11:20.041 --> 11:23.000
One day that lousy book
will really land you into trouble,

11:23.083 --> 11:25.417
and I won't lift a finger to help you.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.959
I won't need your help.

11:28.083 --> 11:31.500
Now let's unload the equipment
and get this iceberg in the air.

11:31.917 --> 11:36.000
Hey, do I look like a dock worker? I fly.

11:36.083 --> 11:40.083
Oh, you wanna fly?
OK, you can fly.

11:57.959 --> 12:00.959
This isn't what I meant!

12:03.542 --> 12:07.917
You can't leave me here!
I'm a pilot, not an ice skater.

12:10.542 --> 12:11.917
Desert dead ahead.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.709
Right on schedule.
By the book.

12:16.792 --> 12:21.208
What did I tell you?
We're almost there, Baloo.

12:21.291 --> 12:26.250
Gee, already?
I've been having so much fun.

12:26.333 --> 12:30.792
Uh-oh. 3:00!
Rebecca, look!

12:30.875 --> 12:33.333
Look, Rebecca! 3:00!

12:33.417 --> 12:36.500
I know how to tell time, thank you.

12:36.750 --> 12:40.417
No, Miss Cunningham.
There's something on our right.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.375
[engines buzzing]

12:49.166 --> 12:52.125
Run for it!
Run for it!

12:55.417 --> 12:57.917
Oh, dear.
We have to get out of here!

12:59.667 --> 13:03.166
No, no, no!
Cut the tow rope first!

13:03.250 --> 13:07.208
Must be the wax in her ears.
That's why she doesn't listen to me.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.083
It's gotta be the wax.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.750
[laughing]

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
[Rebecca]
Why aren't we getting anywhere?

13:15.083 --> 13:18.083
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.917
Ha!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.625
[yells]

13:24.792 --> 13:26.000
What?

13:26.083 --> 13:30.083
Evasive action!
Take evasive action!

13:30.333 --> 13:32.750
[yells]

13:32.834 --> 13:36.083
It's all happening so fast.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.875
-Wait! Here! Here!
-Miss Cunningham, look out!

13:39.959 --> 13:42.083
Pull up! Pull up!

13:47.166 --> 13:50.125
[yelling]

13:50.792 --> 13:52.792
[yelling]

13:52.875 --> 13:54.250
[grunting]

13:55.542 --> 13:56.959
[yells]

13:58.375 --> 13:59.750
[groans]

13:59.834 --> 14:02.792
It just doesn't get any worse than this.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.625
Oops. Spoke too soon.

14:06.709 --> 14:09.834
Whoa!
It's the pirates!

14:25.166 --> 14:26.709
Oh, dear.

14:27.125 --> 14:32.083
Ahoy, iceberg.
You are my prisoners!

14:32.166 --> 14:33.583
[whispering]

14:33.667 --> 14:35.458
Yes, yes.
What is it? What, what, what?

14:35.542 --> 14:37.083
[whispering]

14:37.166 --> 14:39.959
What do you mean
"the iceberg is too heavy"?

14:40.375 --> 14:43.750
[all yelling]

14:44.208 --> 14:46.542
Full power!
Full power!

14:46.625 --> 14:49.417
[yelling]

14:57.250 --> 14:59.083
Baloo, you're all right.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.166
What are you doing
tangled in the tow rope?

15:02.250 --> 15:06.750
-I'll tow rope you--
-So, Baloo, we meet again.

15:08.417 --> 15:13.333
And your cargo. Hmm.
Most, most interesting.

15:13.917 --> 15:17.917
I must tell you, I am intrigued.
Let me see...

15:18.000 --> 15:22.834
Last time, you hid red rubies
in red strawberry jam.

15:22.917 --> 15:27.000
Now you have a clear iceberg.

15:27.083 --> 15:31.750
What could you possibly be hiding
in something clear, hmm?

15:31.834 --> 15:33.208
[whispering]

15:33.291 --> 15:37.500
Glass?
Not glass, diamonds!

15:37.583 --> 15:40.709
-What's he talking about, Baloo?
-Beats me.

15:40.792 --> 15:44.500
Chop up the ice, men.
There are diamonds buried in there.

15:44.583 --> 15:46.875
Not my iceberg!

15:53.166 --> 15:58.417
You see, Baloo?
You cannot make a fool of me twice.

15:58.500 --> 16:02.583
But there really is only ice, Mr. Karnage,
we were bringing it to a desert prince.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.291
Scout's honor.

16:04.375 --> 16:07.750
Ha, and double ha!
I do not believe you.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.959
You tried to trick me.

16:10.041 --> 16:14.375
Well, I have ways of dealing with you!

16:18.417 --> 16:21.166
[Baloo]
Why do I have this ankle tag?

16:21.250 --> 16:24.166
Kit doesn't have one.
Rebecca sure doesn't have one.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.667
At least that I can see.

16:25.750 --> 16:28.417
Maybe if I look up pirates...
Nothing there.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.291
Maybe I shouldn't have made
that crack about his mom.

16:36.625 --> 16:41.000
Escape?
No. No, no, no.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.709
This book has nothing in it
that will help us. It's worthless!

16:44.792 --> 16:48.875
We need help right now, Baloo.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.333
[sobbing] You've got to help us!

16:51.709 --> 16:53.333
Whoa there, boss lady.

16:53.458 --> 16:57.917
Since when does Miss "I-Have-a-License
and-You-Don't" listen to me?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.500
But, Baloo, we're trapped!
No hope!

17:00.583 --> 17:02.875
I can't hear you.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.750
[Rebecca] Listen, Baloo, I'll admit it.
Just because I'm your boss

17:07.834 --> 17:12.959
doesn't mean I gotta do your job.
That book did get me into trouble.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.000
I shouldn't have listened to it.

17:15.083 --> 17:18.290
I... I should have listened to you.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.165
Well, now you're talking, Becky.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.125
I'd be glad to lend a hand,
as long as you listen.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.709
Right. Anything. Anything.

17:28.792 --> 17:32.166
Fine. Hand over the book.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.000
-But--
-Uh, uh, uh.

17:36.583 --> 17:42.333
Great! Now, let's put this thing
to some good use. Kit...

17:42.625 --> 17:43.750
Right.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.208
Going up.

17:47.083 --> 17:50.166
Oh, Mr. Guard, your shoelace is untied.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.083
Uh-uh.
[grunts]

17:53.166 --> 17:56.500
Nothing like a book to put you to sleep.

17:58.333 --> 18:04.291
Shh. Now, we're gonna have to sneak by
old Karny, so try to look pirate-ish.

18:05.917 --> 18:11.542
So, what glorious things
did you find in the iceberg?

18:11.625 --> 18:16.000
Oh, we didn't find nothing
in the iceberg, captain,

18:16.208 --> 18:18.041
except ice.

18:18.542 --> 18:21.959
Ice? Ice? Ice?

18:22.083 --> 18:24.417
[choking] And some snow?

18:24.709 --> 18:25.834
[groans]

18:26.250 --> 18:27.709
Oh...

18:27.792 --> 18:31.208
A hundred tons of ice?

18:31.291 --> 18:33.375
Why would anyone want
a hundred tons of ice?

18:33.458 --> 18:35.458
[whispering]

18:35.542 --> 18:39.917
Perhaps... but where would
they get a straw big enough?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.917
I will ask the prisoners.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.959
No, I will boil them in vinegar first.

18:46.041 --> 18:48.000
Vinegar and maybe some salt.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.917
Then I will ask them.
[chuckles]

18:50.709 --> 18:52.166
[Baloo] Oops.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.250
<i>Uno momento.</i>

18:54.333 --> 18:58.500
Those are no pirates.
Those are the prisoners!

18:58.583 --> 19:00.458
Pull chalks!

19:00.542 --> 19:01.875
[pirates yelling]

19:05.166 --> 19:07.792
I can't believe
they chopped up the whole thing.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.208
The prince will nev--

19:16.709 --> 19:20.375
Wait, wait! What's this red button for?

19:20.458 --> 19:24.291
Oh, that's the bomb bay door release.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.000
Thank you.

19:26.709 --> 19:27.792
[alarm blaring]

19:27.875 --> 19:30.458
He's opened the bomb bay doors!
This is no time for goodbye.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.208
Run away! Run away!

19:34.208 --> 19:37.375
All right, inside, everybody, and hang on.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.834
Take the ship after them!

19:42.917 --> 19:45.583
[whispering]

19:46.458 --> 19:49.375
What do you mean,
the engines are still on full-throttle?

19:49.458 --> 19:51.291
[all yelling]

20:00.458 --> 20:02.542
Ooh, this is wonderful!

20:07.375 --> 20:10.834
[Kit] Start the engines, Baloo!
Start the engines!

20:11.125 --> 20:14.500
This ankle bracelet's caught.
I can't fly!

20:14.583 --> 20:16.834
-I can.
-You?

20:16.917 --> 20:19.583
If you tell me how, I'll listen.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.041
Then strap in, sweetheart.

20:23.125 --> 20:26.166
Now, let's see,
which one is the starter button?

20:28.875 --> 20:33.542
[Baloo] OK, now, gently on the engines
and push forward on the stick.

20:35.375 --> 20:36.917
Brakes! Brakes!

20:38.834 --> 20:43.583
[laughs] Whoo! Bingo!
Right on the money, honey!

20:44.333 --> 20:48.917
Yahoo! You did it, Miss Cunningham!
You did it!

20:49.000 --> 20:54.208
I gotta hand it to you, lady.
It was a real pretty landing.

20:54.291 --> 20:57.291
Really? I am getting the hang of it.

20:57.375 --> 21:00.375
Why, pretty soon... Who am I fooling?

21:00.458 --> 21:04.333
You're the real pilot.
I've been nothing but trouble.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.917
Not listening to you.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.542
I better apologize to the prince

21:08.959 --> 21:12.583
and give him back his 50,000 shapoozies.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.792
Hey, Rebecca, here.

21:14.875 --> 21:18.250
Hey, look,
maybe on the way back to Cape Suzette

21:18.333 --> 21:21.000
I can give you
a flying lesson or something.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.250
Miss Cunningham!
Hello, hello.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.583
I'm sorry about your iceberg,
Your Princeness.

21:26.667 --> 21:30.125
-The snow--
-It is feeling wonderful!

21:30.208 --> 21:31.125
It is?

21:31.208 --> 21:32.458
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.959
I had planned on having very,
very many servants chop up iceberg

21:36.041 --> 21:39.417
to make ski slope for me,
but this much better.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.208
Get whole blizzard! [chuckles]
Come see, come see.

21:42.291 --> 21:45.166
-Ski slope?
-Ski slope?

21:45.250 --> 21:48.000
I guess we delivered our cargo after all.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.792
Well, what do you know?

21:50.875 --> 21:53.083
Of course, you still don't
have a license, Baloo.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.667
Not for another week.
I'll have to fly the missions 'til then.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.500
You're crazy!
Give me my cap back.

21:59.583 --> 22:02.083
Hey, who's gonna fly us home, then?

22:02.166 --> 22:04.000
Can I fly? Can I?

22:04.083 --> 22:05.041
-No!
-No!

22:05.125 --> 22:07.250
I'm not letting you touch the plane.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.625
[Rebecca] I've been doing just fine.
I promise I'll listen.

22:09.709 --> 22:11.000
[Kit] Why can't I fly?
