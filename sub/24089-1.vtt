A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

00:40.083 --> 00:41.792
I got you 50% more than the last time.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.208
You need to give me at least 50.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.375
Ma'am, come and have a look.
I'll give you a discount.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.708
PYONGSONG, PYONGAN PROVINCE

00:54.125 --> 00:56.083
The prices will be the same
no matter where you go.

00:56.875 --> 00:57.875
Don't go.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.417
Whatever, just leave then.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.042
How much are these pair of slippers?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.167
If it disappears,
they'll call you a thief.

01:27.125 --> 01:27.958
Hands up.

01:35.417 --> 01:36.375
Get back.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.292
I didn't steal it.

01:43.167 --> 01:44.583
It's my prescription drug.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.875
He knows that, too. Please tell this guy.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.542
How are you feeling?

01:51.958 --> 01:52.833
Chief Ri.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.750
-Give us some privacy.
-Yes, sir.

02:00.208 --> 02:02.417
It looks like Du-won Kim
and Gwang-dong Park

02:03.333 --> 02:06.125
are up to something.
They have even picked the D-day.

02:06.875 --> 02:07.875
CHIEF
TAE-HAN RI

02:07.958 --> 02:10.667
I tried to gather some intel and found out

02:10.750 --> 02:13.875
that the two of them
have been in touch with In-chin Ryu

02:14.458 --> 02:17.792
of State Security to sell us out
to the Chinese.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.667
What are your thoughts?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.833
What do think they're planning to do
on their "D-day"?

02:32.167 --> 02:33.167
Could it be a coup?

02:35.792 --> 02:41.250
The problem is that those traitors
are blocking access to the Great Leader.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.333
Because of that,
I cannot report the situation to him.

02:46.458 --> 02:50.500
I have no choice but to get rid of them,
so that I can report to him.

02:53.625 --> 02:54.500
But...

02:56.000 --> 02:57.750
Why not the agents
that are in the field now?

02:57.958 --> 02:59.083
Hey.

02:59.167 --> 03:02.458
Gwang-dong Park has
the Supreme Guard Command,

03:03.375 --> 03:05.958
and Du-won Kim has State Security troops.

03:06.208 --> 03:09.625
If one of our agents fails to kill them,
there will be war.

03:09.708 --> 03:10.708
It's obvious.

03:13.792 --> 03:17.583
But you left the organization a while ago.

03:19.958 --> 03:20.833
Comrade Eom.

03:22.292 --> 03:23.792
If you accomplish this mission,

03:23.875 --> 03:27.250
you'll become a hero
who saved the country from a coup,

03:27.375 --> 03:30.000
and your family will get the respect
and privilege that come with it.

03:32.250 --> 03:36.333
I'm the chief director of the RGB.
You have my word.

03:40.833 --> 03:42.542
SEOUL

PER ELECTORAL DISTRICT
SEOUL, BUSAN, DAEGU

03:46.833 --> 03:48.458
-Thank you.
<i>-The nationwide voter turnout</i>

03:48.542 --> 03:50.667
<i>has been measured to be 75.9%.</i>

03:50.792 --> 03:52.458
<i>Seoul, 76%.</i>

03:52.958 --> 03:56.542
<i>Busan, 76.1%. Gwangju, 80.3%</i>.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.458
I'm sorry.

03:57.542 --> 04:01.333
<i>It was 72.4%. In Ulsan, it was 78.4%.</i>

04:01.417 --> 04:04.708
<i>Sejong City, 74.9%.
Gyeonggi Province, 74%.</i>

04:04.792 --> 04:07.417
Goodness, I give your mom so much money
for child support.

04:07.917 --> 04:09.292
Doesn't she feed you?

04:09.375 --> 04:11.292
She doesn't let us eat any junk food.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.917
Eat up when she's not around.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.167
-Daddy.
-Yes.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.583
Can you and Mommy get back together?

04:24.625 --> 04:26.667
Give me a good reason
why we should get back together.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.250
Mommy is a doctor,
and you work at the Blue House.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.208
I used to be super cool,

04:32.292 --> 04:34.667
but I can't brag about you two
because you're now divorced.

04:35.417 --> 04:36.958
You used to be super cool?

04:41.125 --> 04:41.958
Se-min.

04:42.750 --> 04:47.042
Do your friends ever say
that they think you're rude?

04:47.333 --> 04:49.083
-Yes.
-They say that to you?

04:50.042 --> 04:51.583
Then, you sure are my son.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.458
Wait a second. Hang on, okay?

04:55.542 --> 04:57.625
Dad, we have to leave at 6:00 p.m.
Mom is coming.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.833
All right.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.042
EXIT POLL RESULTS

05:05.875 --> 05:08.833
Sir, congratulations.

05:10.333 --> 05:11.708
It is neck and neck,

05:12.292 --> 05:15.625
but all the channels
are predicting the same result.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.542
Se-rim, Se-min.

05:20.042 --> 05:21.333
Did you guys have fun with Dad...

05:22.375 --> 05:24.250
What is this?
Are you guys eating hamburgers now?

05:28.375 --> 05:29.208
A special lecture?

05:30.583 --> 05:32.292
Oh, I'm just filling in?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.125
Of course, I would love to.

05:35.708 --> 05:40.333
You know that I'm an expert when it comes
to filling in or acting as a proxy.

05:42.125 --> 05:43.000
Right, yes.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.250
Okay. I'll see you that day, then.

05:48.042 --> 05:48.875
Take care.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
Where did they go?

06:10.333 --> 06:13.458
PYONGYANG

07:12.625 --> 07:16.917
RESTRICTED AREA,
WARNING, DANGER

07:44.542 --> 07:48.125
WITH YOU, I WILL OPEN
THE ERA OF UNIFICATION.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.875
The guest for Peony Room is here.

07:57.667 --> 07:58.625
Hello.

07:59.417 --> 08:03.042
I hear that your boss is stressed out
because of the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.958
Yes, he is. Foreign Affairs will release
a statement tomorrow about where we stand.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.292
Chinese companies joining the complex
goes against the UN sanctions...

08:10.375 --> 08:11.208
Come on.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.958
Those factories will be fine
since they just produce household goods.

08:16.292 --> 08:19.792
At this rate, six-party talks will totally
be held in the next administration.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.708
Now is a good time to give them something.

08:22.583 --> 08:25.167
That's the only way
we can make them listen, you know.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.375
Isn't he the Minister of State Security,
Du-won Kim?

08:30.458 --> 08:33.332
He's the big-shot power broker
in the DPRK. Did Number One eliminate him?

08:33.417 --> 08:35.250
I don't think it was Number One.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.792
THE MINISTRY OF STATE SECURITY
HONG-JANG RI

08:36.875 --> 08:39.332
Officially, it was a car accident.

08:40.167 --> 08:42.582
-Who's this man beside him?
-In-chin Ryu.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.250
He's the Chief of Chinese State Security
to North Korea.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.917
The last piece of intel I got from him

08:49.000 --> 08:51.708
is that there will be
massive purges in North Korea.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.875
The next administration
will have a lot to deal with.

09:04.375 --> 09:07.708
So, what are your plans
for after leaving the Blue House?

09:08.583 --> 09:12.542
How about a faculty chair

09:12.625 --> 09:14.542
at Peking University's
East Asian Research Center?

09:14.625 --> 09:15.958
Interested?

09:18.875 --> 09:20.958
-Do you like seafood stir-fry, sir?
-Of course.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.875
They make the best seafood stir-fry
in all of Korea.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.500
-A medium seafood stir-fry, please.
-Sure.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.958
-Actually, give us the large size.
-Sure, no problem.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.458
<i>I hear there may be
massive purges in the North.</i>

09:36.542 --> 09:39.542
It sounds like the power struggles there
have gotten quite serious, sir.

09:39.625 --> 09:43.667
Officially, both North Korea and China
closed the case as a car accident.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.417
Should I inform the president-elect?

09:48.500 --> 09:50.958
President-elect Gyeong-yeong Kim
Vows to Open Era of Unification

09:51.042 --> 09:52.292
He'll find out eventually.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.542
It's more fun that way, don't you think?

09:55.458 --> 09:56.417
Right.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.750
Got it, sir.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.125
We have another customer.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.417
Yes, I know. That's for that table.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.083
-What would you like?
-Skinny noodles, please.

10:16.292 --> 10:17.625
It won't take long.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.958
Mr. Park will be in Kaesong on the 24th
for the funeral. Press one to call Uncle.

10:47.042 --> 10:50.333
What happened to our country
at the beginning of the 20th century?

10:50.417 --> 10:51.917
-The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910.
-Right.

10:52.833 --> 10:56.750
But we need to use a proper name for it.
It's called Year of National Humiliation.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.583
After 36 years under Japanese rule,

11:00.667 --> 11:03.875
we regained our independence in 1945.

11:03.958 --> 11:07.125
But there's something
I must point out here.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.458
In Europe, Germany, which started
the war in that part of the world,

11:10.542 --> 11:12.708
ended up being divided into East and West.

11:12.792 --> 11:13.667
But in Asia,

11:14.292 --> 11:19.417
Korea got cut in half even though
Japan was the main culprit behind the war.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.833
Did we start the war?

11:22.333 --> 11:24.375
We failed in regaining independence
on our own.

11:25.833 --> 11:28.375
Right. What happened after that?

11:28.458 --> 11:30.250
-The Korean War.
-Yes, the Korean War.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.958
The very first proxy war
of the Cold War era

11:33.667 --> 11:35.625
broke out on our peninsula.

11:37.583 --> 11:42.125
During the colonial period,
so many people were drafted

11:42.500 --> 11:44.083
and died in the war.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.625
Including the comfort women,
three million people died in total.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.292
Then, another three million
died during the Korean War.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.042
Basically, 20 to 25%
of the entire population died.

11:53.125 --> 11:56.583
In other words,
one of four or five of you died.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.625
Throughout the 20th century,

11:59.208 --> 12:02.417
our ideology was based on Japan.

12:02.917 --> 12:04.167
So, what did we do?

12:04.792 --> 12:06.542
We tried to become like Japan.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.167
As a result,
Samsung is doing better than Sony now,

12:09.250 --> 12:10.750
and Hyundai has beaten Honda as well.

12:10.833 --> 12:14.583
That's how we took action
against the ideology called Japan.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.708
Then, what did North Korea do?

12:20.083 --> 12:21.667
Why was Japan defeated?

12:22.250 --> 12:23.708
-Nuclear bombs.
-Nukes.

12:25.333 --> 12:26.250
Nuclear weapons.

12:26.417 --> 12:27.417
The North Korean regime

12:27.583 --> 12:30.708
will come to an end
because of nukes just like Japan did.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.792
-No way.
-Sounds crazy, right?

12:32.875 --> 12:35.583
You guys are probably thinking
that I'm talking a bunch of bullshit.

12:35.792 --> 12:37.333
Hey, Se-yeong. Am I not right?

12:38.250 --> 12:41.083
Everyone knows that
only nukes can stop nukes.

12:41.167 --> 12:43.167
-What is wrong with people?
-Goodness.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.375
Well, let's be honest here.

12:45.667 --> 12:49.792
Had we been nuclear-armed, the situation
would have never gotten this complicated.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.958
We should at least have the nuclear option
like Japan does.

12:53.208 --> 12:56.792
Or, we should just declare that we'll
consider developing our own nukes

12:56.875 --> 12:59.958
-to position ourselves strategically.
-Taxi!

13:00.042 --> 13:02.125
Come on. You should go home.

13:02.208 --> 13:05.167
-Gosh, Se-yeong.
-You're drunk. Get in.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.625
-Just one more drink, okay?
-Goodness, come on.

13:08.917 --> 13:12.667
Gosh, Se-yeong.
Come on. Let's have just one more drink.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.583
-Please?
-Jeez, you're too much.

13:14.667 --> 13:17.042
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas to you, too!

13:17.125 --> 13:19.708
Hello, there! Happy Christmas.

13:19.792 --> 13:22.333
-Let's go. I'm going in.
-Hey! Gosh, come on.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.208
They said hello to us.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.125
It's on me.
Let's have just one more drink.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.250
Hey, I have an early morning meeting
with the transition team.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.917
I'm going home. Have fun.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.542
Wait, Se-yeong. Jeez.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.375
-Bye!
-Se-yeong.

13:39.250 --> 13:43.375
Hey, have just one more drink with me.
Goodness gracious.

14:02.417 --> 14:03.667
Eat up, In-yeong.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.250
You're pretty and adorable.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.333
You're also a smart cookie,
and you get good grades.

14:09.625 --> 14:14.333
So, just don't listen to
any South Korean music, okay?

14:14.875 --> 14:17.333
Daddy, have you heard of G-Dragon?

14:19.667 --> 14:20.500
G-Dragon?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.250
He's a member of Big Bang.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.292
He's a world-famous musician.

14:25.417 --> 14:27.333
Even the Chinese and Russians
listen to his music.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.375
You wench!

14:29.708 --> 14:31.208
Do you want to ruin your life or what?

14:31.917 --> 14:35.083
Listening to music from the South
could get all of us killed.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.167
Promise Dad
that you won't listen to their music.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.667
I said that the Chinese
and Russians listen to it, not me.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.667
I won't listen to it.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.250
Hurry up and finish your food.

15:36.292 --> 15:37.792
What is going on?

15:38.125 --> 15:40.042
I have been given a mission again.

15:40.833 --> 15:43.708
You'll be sent to the embassy
in Cuba soon.

15:44.292 --> 15:45.333
Take this money.

15:46.750 --> 15:49.917
Cuba? What are you talking about?

15:50.208 --> 15:51.792
It wasn't easy to get this opportunity,

15:52.458 --> 15:54.792
so just listen to me
and move there without me.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.542
I'm not sure what this is about,

15:59.792 --> 16:01.875
but I won't go anywhere
until you come back.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.083
I'll take long.

16:06.542 --> 16:08.125
I'll join you when my mission is done,

16:09.083 --> 16:10.583
so just move there with In-yeong.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.417
Cheol-u!

16:27.792 --> 16:29.458
In-yeong wants to say goodbye to you.

16:33.708 --> 16:34.875
Daddy.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.958
Have a safe trip.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.875
It's cold, honey.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.792
In-yeong must be cold.

16:53.625 --> 16:54.917
Go back in.

KAESONG INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

17:17.375 --> 17:20.375
<i>The groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow
wouldn't have been possible</i>

17:20.458 --> 17:23.083
<i>without our Chinese comrades'
strenuous efforts and our technology...</i>

17:23.166 --> 17:27.958
Mr. Park will visit at 2:00 p.m.
Wait at the vent window and greet him.

17:56.333 --> 18:00.667
BE POLITICALLY PASSIONATE
AND RIGOROUSLY PRODUCTIVE

18:24.208 --> 18:25.375
Hey, get the dogs out of here.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.583
WARNING: PRIVATE PROPERTY
NO TRESPASSING

19:25.292 --> 19:27.500
<i>I heard the Great Leader
is headed for Kaesong himself.</i>

19:27.667 --> 19:31.583
<i>And apparently, Park has mobilized
the entire Supreme Guard Command.</i>

19:31.667 --> 19:33.958
-Where is Park now?
-He's in Pyongyang, sir.

19:35.792 --> 19:36.708
Get the chopper ready!

19:37.750 --> 19:40.167
-Does that mean he...
-Yes, that's right.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.833
Gwang-dong Park, that bastard.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.667
Gosh, please.

19:57.750 --> 20:01.083
Are you girls trying to get noticed,
so that you can move up in the world?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.542
-What's your problem?
-Move! Move back, will you?

20:04.625 --> 20:08.417
<i>Our Supreme Leader is arriving!</i>

20:08.500 --> 20:10.917
-Our Great General is here!
-Great General!

20:11.000 --> 20:14.750
-Hurrah!
<i>-Our Dear Supreme Leader</i>

20:15.083 --> 20:19.750

<i>Today, our Dear Supreme Leader...</i>

21:01.958 --> 21:03.042
Gwang-dong Park...

21:04.042 --> 21:05.125
Gwang-dong Park.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.583
What is it?

21:16.667 --> 21:18.750
MINISTER OF PEOPLE'S ARMED FORCES
YEONG-SIK CHOI

21:18.833 --> 21:21.417
THE KOREAN PEOPLE'S ARMY ALWAYS WINS

CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF
OF THE KOREAN PEOPLE'S ARMY

21:29.167 --> 21:30.875
DIRECTOR OF THE GENERAL POLITICAL BUREAU

21:38.708 --> 21:42.708
Number One is here,
but no sign of Gwang-dong Park.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.917
SENDING

21:52.708 --> 21:54.708
<i>The country of invincible strength...</i>

21:54.792 --> 21:57.167
FAILED TO SEND

22:04.792 --> 22:07.708
<i>He said that we should set an example</i>

22:07.792 --> 22:09.167
-General!
<i>-for the rest of the world</i>

22:09.250 --> 22:11.083
<i>with our burgeoning economic state,</i>

22:11.667 --> 22:13.500

<i>For the people,</i>

22:25.208 --> 22:29.667
<i>Our Dear Supreme Leader Comrade.</i>

23:10.750 --> 23:15.417
Su-mi, wake up. Open your eyes.
Please, Su-mi!

23:15.625 --> 23:16.625
Are you all right?

23:20.083 --> 23:21.083
Wake up!

23:21.167 --> 23:24.083
Wake up. You can't die here.
Let's get out of here.

23:24.208 --> 23:25.083
Open your eyes!

23:25.917 --> 23:28.542
Please, we have to
get out of here quickly.

23:28.625 --> 23:29.667
No!

23:33.292 --> 23:34.417
Eun-hyeok!

23:35.250 --> 23:37.667
There's another one. It's coming again!

23:40.708 --> 23:41.542
Run.

24:56.417 --> 24:58.333
You see this? The Americans did this.

25:02.583 --> 25:03.958
Make sure there are no survivors.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.583
South Korea is
only 20 minutes away from here.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.583
It's a coup. I can't stay here!

25:11.000 --> 25:14.958
Arrange things,
so that I can go to the South.

25:15.542 --> 25:17.458
Call the Ministry of Foreign Affairs!

25:21.917 --> 25:23.125
Su-mi!

25:25.958 --> 25:27.375
Hey, look.

25:27.458 --> 25:29.250
It's the general. Our Great General!

25:29.333 --> 25:32.250
-Don't shoot.
-Su-mi, wait!

25:34.125 --> 25:35.875
Gosh, General! What should we do?

25:35.958 --> 25:37.500
Help! Our...

25:41.708 --> 25:42.792
Over there!

25:45.417 --> 25:46.583
Get them!

26:17.458 --> 26:18.667
Bring the truck!

26:20.958 --> 26:24.792
-Please let us out!
-We must get out of here!

26:29.333 --> 26:31.750
Su-mi, his leg.

26:32.417 --> 26:34.458
-It's...
-What happened to his leg?

26:35.542 --> 26:36.542
Let's tie this around it.

26:37.417 --> 26:38.500
Su-mi...

26:39.042 --> 26:41.667
Loosen his clothes, too.
What if he can't breathe?

26:42.792 --> 26:43.917
I'm sorry, sir.

26:47.542 --> 26:50.958
Why is our Dear General's hand so cold?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.125
Dear General!

27:01.000 --> 27:02.292
Move. Make way!

27:02.375 --> 27:05.167
It will be on you
if we shut down the oil pipelines.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.667
You'll have to take all the blame.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.833
Talk to your higher-up.

27:15.417 --> 27:17.167
Yes. Noted, sir.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.250
Open it already.

27:20.792 --> 27:22.042
Open the gates!

27:22.125 --> 27:23.833
Get in your cars.

27:24.708 --> 27:27.583
-Hurry. Go, move!
-Quick!

27:30.625 --> 27:32.042
MILITARY DEMARCATION LINE

27:54.708 --> 27:56.000
Close the gates!

27:56.083 --> 27:57.417
Close the gates!

27:58.000 --> 27:59.167
Go block the gates!

28:12.792 --> 28:14.292
Have you lost your mind?

28:14.417 --> 28:15.792
This will take us to South Korea.

28:15.875 --> 28:18.250
What do you think will happen
if we go back up now? Get down.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.958
This is pine mushroom tea.

28:28.792 --> 28:31.833
Don't worry. The guest first.
Go ahead and serve him first.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.833
I guess she's nervous
to meet her new boss.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.500
I'm still the owner
of this place though, right?

28:39.750 --> 28:40.667
Have some tea.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.792
Hang on a second.

28:45.875 --> 28:48.542
Gyeong-yeong,
was this your third election?

28:48.625 --> 28:52.458
I participated in three nomination races,
but this was my second election.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.958
Oh, yes. That's right.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.583
Gyeong-yeong. You see,

29:00.667 --> 29:04.083
I have never been this happy
and relaxed since I became President.

29:04.583 --> 29:09.375
People point the finger at you
no matter what you do in this position,

29:09.625 --> 29:11.500
but no one criticizes me these days.

29:14.458 --> 29:16.083
Oh, Mr. Park.

29:18.667 --> 29:22.000
An MLRS from the US Army Second Division
went missing at dawn,

29:22.250 --> 29:25.500
and about 20 minutes ago,
the seized MLRS fired two Steel Rain bombs

29:25.625 --> 29:27.208
at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.

29:27.292 --> 29:29.917
The ROK-US Combined Forces Command
wants us to issue DEFCON Three.

29:30.750 --> 29:33.042
It was seized? Who seized the MLRS?

29:33.125 --> 29:36.500
The bodies found at the scene
were in our military uniform,

29:37.625 --> 29:40.250
but their tags were fake.
We should look into it to find out more...

29:40.333 --> 29:42.583
Wait, hold on.

29:42.667 --> 29:46.875
Aren't Chinese companies opening factories
in the Kaesong Industrial Complex today?

29:48.917 --> 29:50.083
I'm sorry to interrupt.

29:50.708 --> 29:53.708
-The situation is very urgent.
-What is going on?

29:54.292 --> 29:57.833
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
is requesting us to let their people

29:57.958 --> 30:00.958
in Kaesong
through the Inter-Korean Transit Office

30:01.042 --> 30:03.000
-into our country.
-Let them in.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.667
We should help them.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.917
PASSENGERS GET OFF

30:33.042 --> 30:35.083
We got a go-ahead. Let them through.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.292
-Move!
-Come on.

30:37.250 --> 30:38.083
Move!

30:42.250 --> 30:44.708
INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE

30:49.833 --> 30:52.792
THE CITY YOU WANT TO LIVE IN
ENTERPRISE CITY, PAJU

31:41.167 --> 31:44.625
The leader was killed in the bombing.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.250
A civil war has broken out,
and we need to deal with it first.

31:48.667 --> 31:53.125
Let me make one thing clear to you.
The nuclear weapons and Pyongyang.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.375
I have full command of them!

31:55.917 --> 31:57.958
Now, tell me where you stand.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.583
How could you leak it to the press

32:10.667 --> 32:12.875
without consulting us first?

32:15.917 --> 32:18.000
We've still got a few months left.

32:24.583 --> 32:27.833
JOANNE MARTIN,
CIA STATION CHIEF IN SOUTH KOREA

33:24.625 --> 33:25.542
Mr. Ri?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.875
Doctor! Help!

33:37.875 --> 33:39.208
I think it's this way.

33:40.667 --> 33:42.125
We're closed for the day.

33:44.375 --> 33:45.375
Excuse me!

33:46.208 --> 33:47.583
You can't go in there!

33:49.250 --> 33:50.917
We don't deliver babies here.

33:55.875 --> 33:58.875
Look, I'm an obstetrician.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.083
I'll call an ambulance for you, so...

34:02.208 --> 34:03.167
Treat him.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.292
I promise. I won't hurt you.

34:07.375 --> 34:08.250
I told you.

34:09.542 --> 34:11.208
I'm an obstetrician.

34:11.792 --> 34:12.958
You should go somewhere else.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.958
-I won't call the police.
-You're still a doctor.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.083
Please treat him. He's severely injured.

34:23.667 --> 34:24.625
Please, Doctor.

34:37.417 --> 34:38.292
Isn't this man...

34:38.875 --> 34:40.833
-Be respectful.
-Be respectful.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.417
General!

34:51.208 --> 34:52.167
What's your blood type?

34:54.417 --> 34:55.542
Su-mi.

34:55.625 --> 34:59.625
So, is your blood
going into the Great General's body now?

35:01.875 --> 35:02.833
I hope that...

35:03.833 --> 35:07.042
my blood is good enough
for our Great General.

35:08.042 --> 35:09.542
You must be so honored.

35:12.833 --> 35:14.375
The doctor...

35:34.583 --> 35:36.833
Chief Ri. It's me, Cheol-u.

35:38.042 --> 35:40.625
Gwang-dong Park didn't come to Kaesong,
but our leader did.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.958
We got bombed,
and the Guard Command shot each other.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.292
What is happening, sir?

35:45.375 --> 35:47.417
<i>Park beat us. It's a coup d'état.</i>

35:47.625 --> 35:49.500
<i>-Where are you now?</i>
-I'm in Ilsan, sir.

35:50.292 --> 35:52.542
<i>Ilsan? You mean in the South?</i>

35:52.792 --> 35:53.625
Yes, sir.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.458
I'm...

35:57.667 --> 35:59.208
with the Great Leader now.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.167
How is he? Is he alive?

36:03.542 --> 36:06.792
<i>He is alive,
but he's in critical condition.</i>

36:08.208 --> 36:10.292
Comrade Eom, listen carefully.

36:10.417 --> 36:13.125
<i>We must bring back his body at least.</i>

36:13.292 --> 36:16.542
<i>Park's coup will succeed
the moment he's convinced</i>

36:16.667 --> 36:17.958
<i>that the leader is dead.</i>

36:18.542 --> 36:19.875
Stay there with him

36:20.500 --> 36:23.667
and guard him at all costs.
I'll send a few guys soon.

36:23.958 --> 36:24.792
Yes, sir.

36:33.208 --> 36:36.833
These tanks belong
to Sariwon 815 Mechanized Corps,

36:37.542 --> 36:41.917
and these are from the 820 Armored Corps
of Pyongyang Defense Command.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.708
The 815 tanks that were defeated
in the battle

36:44.792 --> 36:46.583
retreated back
and have joined Division Four,

36:46.667 --> 36:49.667
and the 820 Armored Corps is remaining
in the southern outskirts of Pyongyang.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.167
They're probably guarding the city.

36:53.500 --> 36:54.750
It's a coup, sir.

36:54.833 --> 36:58.458
We must quickly find out who's behind it
and whether it has succeeded or not.

36:58.625 --> 36:59.458
Yes, sir.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.167
Well, this still needs to be confirmed,

37:02.750 --> 37:06.542
but I received intel that North Korea's
Number One died during the bombing.

37:07.708 --> 37:09.792
-And? And what?
-Calm down.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.750
They may declare war.

37:11.833 --> 37:15.500
Mr. Kwak. I get that we're
in the last days of this administration,

37:15.583 --> 37:17.167
but you can't crash a ministerial meeting

37:17.250 --> 37:20.125
and deliver that kind of news
in such an offhand manner.

37:20.208 --> 37:21.750
Who's your source?

37:22.458 --> 37:24.708
The CIA on the death

37:25.167 --> 37:27.875
and the Chinese State Security
on the war, sir.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.625
I did what I could.

37:37.208 --> 37:41.292
He got shot
in the head, shoulder, and thigh.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.958
He was shot through the shoulder,
so I just patched the hole.

37:45.792 --> 37:46.792
From the thigh...

37:49.333 --> 37:51.458
I took this out.

37:53.417 --> 37:55.208
I think the femoral artery is ruptured,

37:55.417 --> 37:57.208
but all I could do was bandage the wound.

37:58.708 --> 38:02.500
The biggest problem is that there's one
inside the cranial cavity as well.

38:04.208 --> 38:05.542
I can't do it.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.667
Why can't you? You're a doctor.

38:11.125 --> 38:15.625
I'm an obstetrician, not a neurosurgeon.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.667
Unless there's a baby inside this belly...

38:22.417 --> 38:25.667
I just can't do it.

38:28.375 --> 38:31.750
My people are coming.
Please treat him just until they get here.

38:35.958 --> 38:38.792
At my clinic, North Korea's...

38:41.000 --> 38:42.750
Their leader is here.

38:44.208 --> 38:45.167
No, I mean...

38:45.250 --> 38:46.083
Gosh!

38:47.167 --> 38:49.417
What are you doing in the dark?

38:50.000 --> 38:50.917
Oh god.

38:51.125 --> 38:52.708
I'm looking for some food for you guys.

38:55.167 --> 38:57.083
You keep food at a place like this?

38:57.958 --> 38:59.417
Yes, it's up here.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
It's hot. Here, try it.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.708
Isn't this <i>yibap</i> ?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.375
I'm sorry? "<i>Yibap</i>"?

39:09.208 --> 39:10.750
This is <i>yibap</i>.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.708
Rice, you know.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.125
Oh, I see. Rice.

39:16.875 --> 39:17.958
We're eating white rice.

39:19.417 --> 39:24.333
-Su-mi, what's this black thing?
-I'll try it.

39:26.833 --> 39:30.042
Hey, it's really good. It has meat.

39:32.417 --> 39:36.458
I was going to get the ration ticket
exchanged for food

39:36.542 --> 39:38.500
after work today.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.292
There's no food at home.

39:42.708 --> 39:46.375
My dad and Jeong-min must be starving now.

39:48.875 --> 39:50.083
Hey, Min-gyeong.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.500
Why are you worried about those
in the comfort of their own home?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.458
They should worry about you if anything.

39:56.542 --> 39:57.625
Eat up.

39:57.708 --> 40:00.583
We must eat so that we can keep
the Great General safe.

40:00.667 --> 40:01.500
Okay?

40:08.833 --> 40:09.833
Eat this, too.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.083
Hey, good. Wipe your tears.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.667
Try the black stuff, too.
It's really good.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.208
It is tasty. She made it so easily, too.

40:28.167 --> 40:30.250
-Go stay inside the room.
-Yes, sir.

40:31.083 --> 40:31.917
Let's go.

40:53.292 --> 40:54.625
Where is he?

42:05.083 --> 42:07.042
OPERATING ROOM

42:12.500 --> 42:16.333
AREUM OBSTETRICS CLINIC

42:50.583 --> 42:51.458
Drop the gun.

43:45.208 --> 43:46.042
Move over.

44:17.875 --> 44:18.708
Hold tight!

44:37.250 --> 44:38.958
Su-mi, look.

44:39.292 --> 44:41.875
The General is bleeding. Su-mi, look!

44:43.375 --> 44:48.250
I think it's my blood.

44:49.708 --> 44:50.708
Su-mi.

44:52.458 --> 44:54.125
Help me lay her down on her back. Now!

44:57.792 --> 44:59.542
Su-mi! No...

45:02.583 --> 45:04.667
-Su-mi.
-You have to focus!

45:05.083 --> 45:06.917
Keep your hand here.
Press down hard, okay?

45:08.667 --> 45:11.083
-Su-mi...
-We have to take her to a big hospital.

45:11.333 --> 45:13.625
She gave him her blood,
and she's bleeding too much now.

45:13.750 --> 45:16.458
-Su-mi, please wake up.
-We don't have time!

45:17.292 --> 45:18.125
No, we can't.

45:18.958 --> 45:20.667
Find a place to treat them in secret.

45:22.375 --> 45:25.000
Please don't let Su-mi die, sir...

45:27.250 --> 45:31.208
Su-mi, wake up. Please, Su-mi...

45:32.917 --> 45:35.125
Please do something.

45:35.208 --> 45:39.375
Hey, Su-hyeon.
I'm sorry to ask you this, but...

45:55.000 --> 45:56.458
This way. Hurry.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.042
-Hey, Suk-jeong.
-This way.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.583
Hey, what is going on?

46:04.667 --> 46:07.500
Shouldn't you take them to the ER?
You know that I'm a plastic surgeon.

46:07.583 --> 46:10.708
I'm an obstetrician.
At least you're a surgeon. Move over.

46:10.792 --> 46:13.625
Go in here. This way. Come this way.

46:15.917 --> 46:16.750
Hey.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.333
What...

46:22.667 --> 46:23.500
What happened?

46:28.208 --> 46:30.083
Please help us. I won't hurt you.

46:30.833 --> 46:34.000
I'm sorry, Su-hyeon. Please help them.

46:34.583 --> 46:36.958
Let's save her life first.

47:02.583 --> 47:04.875
HANDLING AND DOCUMENTATION
OF NARCOTIC DRUGS

47:25.542 --> 47:26.708
What are you doing?

47:27.958 --> 47:30.375
Why aren't you treating her?

47:30.958 --> 47:32.167
Doctor!

47:38.042 --> 47:38.917
Su-mi.

47:39.542 --> 47:42.292
Su-mi, no...

47:44.833 --> 47:47.292
You can't die! Su-mi...

47:51.417 --> 47:53.750
Su-mi...

47:59.542 --> 48:01.292
Mr. Kwak.

48:03.208 --> 48:05.500
We got an update from the scene
at the clinic in Ilsan.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.042
What did they say?

48:08.333 --> 48:09.833
Three bodies were found,

48:10.208 --> 48:12.458
and it looks like all of them
are North Korean agents.

48:12.792 --> 48:15.208
A Chinese van full of plush pandas
was also found at the scene,

48:15.542 --> 48:17.042
and it probably came from Kaesong.

48:18.958 --> 48:21.708
-Dead North Korean agents?
-About 20 minutes before the shootings,

48:21.792 --> 48:23.708
a 911 call was made from the clinic.

48:23.792 --> 48:24.750
What was the call about?

48:25.500 --> 48:27.917
The caller said that
the North Korean president was there.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.375
What? Give me that?

48:30.125 --> 48:31.750
North Korea doesn't have a president.

48:35.875 --> 48:37.792
"Suk-jeong Kwon. She was born in 1980."

48:38.417 --> 48:39.458
Suk-jeong Kwon?

48:41.333 --> 48:43.500
"Areum Obstetrics Clinic"?

48:46.125 --> 48:48.458
NASTY WOMAN

49:09.958 --> 49:13.833
Se-rim, I guess you were sleeping.
It's Daddy.

49:15.500 --> 49:16.542
Your mom's home, right?

49:20.542 --> 49:21.667
With Auntie Suk-jeong?

49:22.375 --> 49:23.417
She's still at the clinic?

49:24.833 --> 49:26.958
I see. It's nothing.

49:27.042 --> 49:30.125
I'm sorry I woke you up.
All right, sweet dreams.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.875
I'll be at this address.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.500
I want you to call me in an hour.

49:41.583 --> 49:44.667
If my phone is off, or if I don't pick up,
send the police...

49:44.750 --> 49:45.583
No.

49:47.792 --> 49:48.833
Send the special forces.

49:49.667 --> 49:51.625
-You got that?
-Pardon? Why?

49:51.708 --> 49:53.375
Don't forget. In an hour from now.

49:53.458 --> 49:55.250
-Is something going on?
-Call me in an hour.

49:55.333 --> 49:57.042
Mr. Kwak!

49:58.375 --> 49:59.708
I heard that North Korea is...

50:00.667 --> 50:03.083
just on the other side of the river
by the Jayu Motorway,

50:03.875 --> 50:06.542
but I guess it never really hit me.

50:09.125 --> 50:10.458
It's so close.

50:12.375 --> 50:13.583
I'm sorry.

50:15.333 --> 50:16.292
Su-hyeon.

50:17.167 --> 50:18.208
Su-hyeon!

50:19.208 --> 50:23.208
Why do you never pick up your phone? Hey.

50:28.250 --> 50:29.208
Who are you?

50:31.417 --> 50:33.750
-Cheol-u!
-There you are, Su-hyeon. Gosh...

50:34.208 --> 50:35.750
Take their cell phones from them.

50:36.458 --> 50:39.042
I'm really sorry.
I sincerely apologize for...

50:39.125 --> 50:40.833
Don't worry. It's okay.

50:40.917 --> 50:42.750
Go bring something to tie them with.

50:46.083 --> 50:47.250
Sit!

50:48.958 --> 50:50.042
Sit down!

50:57.458 --> 50:58.625
That man over there.

51:00.792 --> 51:02.500
He's your Number One, isn't he?

51:02.583 --> 51:05.042
He probably couldn't go back
because of the coup.

51:05.125 --> 51:07.667
You guys crossed the border
with the Chinese, didn't you?

51:08.375 --> 51:09.708
Who are you?

51:09.792 --> 51:12.542
What a crazy coincidence.

51:12.625 --> 51:16.333
No, "coincidence" isn't the right word.
Shall we call this "fate"?

51:16.917 --> 51:19.125
I'm the senior secretary
for Foreign Affairs and Security.

51:19.208 --> 51:20.625
I work for the Number One here.

51:25.833 --> 51:26.708
I'll help you.

51:27.958 --> 51:30.125
No matter how skilled you are,

51:30.208 --> 51:32.958
there isn't much you can do
with just that little girl there.

51:33.042 --> 51:36.000
Let's say your Number One gets
the treatment he needs and survives.

51:36.083 --> 51:37.292
We'll make sure he can live.

51:37.750 --> 51:40.417
But, then what?
How will you take him back to the North?

51:40.917 --> 51:42.208
You son of a bitch.

51:44.583 --> 51:45.750
Those men...

51:47.792 --> 51:49.583
who tried to kill you and Number One
in Ilsan.

51:49.667 --> 51:51.542
They're your people, right?

51:52.167 --> 51:53.292
In this situation...

51:54.625 --> 51:56.500
getting our help will be...

51:57.583 --> 51:59.917
-your wisest bet.
-Shut up, you prick.

52:02.042 --> 52:05.125
Your country will declare war soon.

52:10.125 --> 52:14.292
<i>We hereby declare war
on the US and South Korea.</i>

52:15.375 --> 52:18.875
<i>American imperialists and their puppets,
South Koreans,</i>

52:18.958 --> 52:22.542
<i>bombed the Kaesong Industrial Complex
yesterday, targeting our Dear Leader</i>

52:22.625 --> 52:26.375
<i>and top commanding officers
who were on site.</i>

52:26.458 --> 52:31.333
<i>In response to this unpardonable atrocity,
the Supreme Command</i>

52:31.417 --> 52:35.708
<i>has decided to terminate
the armistice agreement and declare war.</i>

52:35.792 --> 52:38.958
If you see them doing anything suspicious,
kill them all.

52:39.708 --> 52:42.125
<i>There will be nothing but victory
for our nation of heroes.</i>

52:42.333 --> 52:45.833
<i>Once war breaks out,
our people and mighty army</i>

52:45.917 --> 52:50.958
<i>will burn all those American invaders
and the pathetic mutts at the Blue House</i>

52:51.042 --> 52:54.542
<i>with our invincible nuclear bombs.</i>

52:54.625 --> 52:56.042
I'll declare martial law. Get ready.

53:12.792 --> 53:14.000
How is he?

53:14.083 --> 53:17.667
He could die if he isn't transferred to
a bigger hospital for surgery immediately.

53:18.375 --> 53:19.208
But...

53:20.000 --> 53:21.708
why did we declare war?

53:21.792 --> 53:25.667
<i>Hey, who's in control of Pyongyang now?
It's Gwang-dong Park.</i>

53:26.333 --> 53:29.750
<i>It was the only way
to stop the frontline troops</i>

53:29.958 --> 53:31.625
<i>from forcing their way into the city.</i>

53:32.292 --> 53:33.958
<i>This phone is being tapped.</i>

53:34.250 --> 53:36.417
<i>We got attacked in Ilsan and nearly died.</i>

53:37.917 --> 53:38.750
<i>I think...</i>

53:40.083 --> 53:42.292
We should ask
the government here for help.

53:42.375 --> 53:44.583
<i>That's the only way
we can save his life, sir.</i>

53:45.417 --> 53:47.042
Hey, Comrade Eom.

53:47.125 --> 53:48.542
<i>Make sure you aren't being tapped.</i>

54:03.125 --> 54:04.875
They declared war just for a show.

54:04.958 --> 54:06.125
It's all because of the coup

54:06.208 --> 54:08.333
led by Gwang-dong Park,
the Supreme Guard Commander.

54:09.042 --> 54:12.083
He did it to make sure
the frontline troops can't be mobilized,

54:12.417 --> 54:14.875
so the South must not
do anything reckless and just wait.

54:14.958 --> 54:16.667
You want us to do nothing and wait it out?

54:16.750 --> 54:18.083
Does that even make sense to you?

54:18.667 --> 54:20.958
Save our leader's life as you promised.

54:21.375 --> 54:23.792
And let our frontline troops
go to Pyongyang

54:23.875 --> 54:25.625
so that they can stop the coup.

54:25.708 --> 54:29.125
Please convince
your government to help us.

54:29.500 --> 54:32.500
It's the only way
we can save this peninsula.

54:50.292 --> 54:52.167
A nuclear strike on North Korea

54:52.250 --> 54:55.417
will result in immense damage
from EMP and radiation.

55:45.458 --> 55:48.208
If it absolutely cannot be avoided,
we will gladly go to war.

55:49.000 --> 55:52.208
However, we should only resort to war

55:52.458 --> 55:54.667
when all other options are exhausted.
And a nuclear war...

56:08.083 --> 56:08.917
He's right.

56:09.792 --> 56:12.250
We requested this meeting.

56:13.292 --> 56:16.792
We appreciate your cordial review
and suggestions regarding this matter.

56:16.875 --> 56:18.708
Could you please tell us

56:18.792 --> 56:22.042
roughly how much time can be given to us
without hindering the operation?

56:50.292 --> 56:52.500
CHEOL-U KWAK
I got Number One, but he's unconscious.

56:52.583 --> 56:55.333
As President of the Republic of Korea,

56:55.417 --> 56:57.333
-I order the preemptive nuclear...
-Mr. President.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.083
Mr. Kwak.

57:18.667 --> 57:20.250
These are what we found at the scene.

57:24.042 --> 57:26.917
This military uniform and the chocolate
were found inside the van.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.708
-Keep them separate.
-Okay.

57:32.375 --> 57:34.667
All clear. No threat of danger.

57:36.792 --> 57:39.500
-Send this to the digital forensic lab.
-Got it.

57:44.167 --> 57:48.625
<i>My fellow citizens. In accordance
with Article 77 of the Constitution</i>

57:48.958 --> 57:52.042
<i>as well as Articles Two and Ten
of the Martial Law Act,</i>

57:52.125 --> 57:55.000
<i>I declare nationwide martial law</i>

57:55.083 --> 57:58.125
<i>as of 6:00 a.m. on December 25.</i>

57:58.208 --> 58:00.500
<i>My dear fellow citizens.</i>

58:00.583 --> 58:03.833
<i>Please stay calm and go on
with your daily lives.</i>

58:03.917 --> 58:06.292
<i>I ask that you cooperate with us,
the government,</i>

58:06.375 --> 58:08.458
<i>and the Martial Law Command.</i>

58:10.542 --> 58:11.458
So, what do you think?

58:12.875 --> 58:16.375
According to the polygraph,
it looks like everything he said is true.

58:19.083 --> 58:20.333
What about the girl?

58:20.417 --> 58:22.583
I don't think she knows anything, sir.

58:26.042 --> 58:28.958
My, I must say...

58:29.917 --> 58:33.125
-You impressed me with this one.
-Thank you, sir.

58:33.208 --> 58:37.417
You went to see your ex-wife
during a national crisis

58:37.500 --> 58:39.333
and ended up capturing
the leader of our enemy.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.167
Not too bad for a stand-in.

58:43.250 --> 58:44.333
Good work.

58:44.917 --> 58:45.958
I'm very impressed.

58:49.167 --> 58:50.083
Have a good day, sir.

59:05.917 --> 59:07.625
He can't see us, right?

59:08.000 --> 59:08.875
That's right.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.792
-He has something to say.
-To me?

59:19.708 --> 59:21.833
How's the Great Leader?

59:21.917 --> 59:24.500
I have reported to my higher-ups
that your government is helping,

59:24.583 --> 59:27.792
so it will be your country's fault
if anything happens to him.

59:28.458 --> 59:31.333
Well, you people started this mess.

59:31.667 --> 59:33.292
Why do we have to take the blame?

59:35.833 --> 59:38.167
The first round is done,
so you should get some rest.

59:39.792 --> 59:41.500
If anything happens to him,

59:42.792 --> 59:44.042
there will definitely be war!

59:46.542 --> 59:47.417
Okay.

59:54.333 --> 59:55.917
<i>Chief Park of National Security must have</i>

59:56.000 --> 59:59.208
leaked the information about you getting
Number One while you were bringing him.

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.542
-I heard they responded right away.
-Who are "they"?

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:05.708
Those in the North will come
to confirm in person and talk.

01:00:07.583 --> 01:00:10.625
While you were gone, we almost agreed
to a preemptive nuclear strike.

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:13.833
The President-elect said

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:16.417
we should decide
after meeting their representative.

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.042
We stopped the war for the time being.

01:00:19.542 --> 01:00:20.458
So, who's coming?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.292
And who will meet him?

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:24.625
Well, that's the thing.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.542
We insisted on deciding what to do
after meeting them,

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.958
but they won't tell us anything.

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:33.833
Those at the Blue House keep insisting
that they'll send someone from their team.

01:00:35.542 --> 01:00:37.875
They obviously want all the credit.

01:00:37.958 --> 01:00:40.958
Chief Park is a very ambitious man.

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:46.958
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:52.500
What has he been up to?

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:54.750
He's just been sleeping, sir.

01:00:54.958 --> 01:00:57.333
-Has he eaten?
-He keeps refusing to eat.

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:00.875
It's me.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:03.083
I picked up a burger for you.

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:05.708
Do you know what a burger is?

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.625
What's it called in the North?

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:12.083
A bun with meat?
Is that how you folks call it?

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.542
Try a taste of capitalism.

01:01:18.333 --> 01:01:20.000
I saw in the investigation report

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:21.875
that your name is Cheol-u too,
Cheol-u Eom.

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:26.417
Maybe we were really meant to cross paths.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.333
We have the same name. I'm Cheol-u Kwak.

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:31.208
What does your name mean?

01:01:31.292 --> 01:01:33.292
Mine means "bright world"
in Chinese characters.

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:36.208
So, you were born in 1977.

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:40.333
Then, I'm a year older.
Let's just talk casually like friends.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.458
Show me some respect, will you?
Answer me at least. Jeez.

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:49.375
What's wrong?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.542
Hey. Guys, call a doctor!

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:54.292
-Now!
-It's okay.

01:01:55.458 --> 01:01:56.667
Just give me some painkillers.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.083
Take all this back.

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.750
He's asking for this though.
Let's give him this.

01:02:03.167 --> 01:02:04.167
Sure, that's no problem.

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:08.625
Here.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:14.458
You should get treated for your addiction
and quit drugs for good while you're here.

01:02:15.083 --> 01:02:18.542
You're still young, you know.
You have many years left to live.

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:20.875
It looks like you're cold.

01:02:29.375 --> 01:02:31.750
Do you want the burger?

01:02:41.708 --> 01:02:42.917
So?

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.625
They'll use the tunnels
if their visit is confidential.

01:02:46.792 --> 01:02:47.625
Tunnels?

01:02:49.958 --> 01:02:53.125
We have dug about 20 underground tunnels
in the last 60 years or so.

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:56.917
I heard that about five to six of them
can still be used.

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:00.500
Underground tunnels, I see.

01:03:05.417 --> 01:03:06.583
Then, who's coming?

01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:09.875
The RGB controls and manages
all underground tunnels.

01:03:10.667 --> 01:03:14.208
Only the chief director can open them up
in emergency situations.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.083
The chief director? Are you talking about
Chief Director Tae-han Ri of the RGB?

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:21.042
Wait.

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.750
From what I know,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.250
he's one of the most prominent
hardliners against us

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:30.750
He's coming down here to stop the war?

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.333
You guys can't handle my country
with such a dichotomous way of thinking.

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:39.333
Just kill him as soon as he gets here
and start the war, then.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:41.250
Jeez, calm down.

01:03:44.917 --> 01:03:47.167
You're sure Tae-han Ri is coming, right?

01:03:48.667 --> 01:03:50.208
If our leader recovers,

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:52.458
Gwang-dong Park's coup will fail.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.208
He'll come to make sure that's the case.

01:03:56.292 --> 01:03:59.292
Take me to where the meeting will be held.
I'll explain the situation to him.

01:04:13.292 --> 01:04:14.667
<i>The guy who brought Number One here</i>

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.667
is close enough to Tae-han Ri
to report to him in person.

01:04:17.875 --> 01:04:20.333
-If we take him to the meeting...
<i>-Tae-han Ri?</i>

01:04:20.417 --> 01:04:22.667
Chief Director Tae-han Ri of the RGB?

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:26.458
Yes, sir. It'll help him trust us
and speed up the talks.

01:04:26.542 --> 01:04:27.792
We don't work with guerrillas.

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:29.333
-I have to go.
-What do you mean, sir?

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:32.500
<i>Didn't he sneak into our country
and shoot people? I'm hanging up!</i>

01:04:33.167 --> 01:04:35.708
The meeting wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for him.

01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:37.292
-What did you just say?
<i>-I'm sorry, sir.</i>

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.625
<i>I thought you hung up.</i>

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.292
<i>This red dot here</i>

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:52.917
<i>shows the GPS location
of Chief Park's car.</i>

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:54.583
<i>Just follow the signal, sir.</i>

01:05:02.792 --> 01:05:04.667
Have they agreed to send our leader

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:06.708
back to the North when he recovers?

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.667
They probably will.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:12.875
Unless he wants to stay here, that is.

01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:14.625
How dare you say that?

01:05:15.292 --> 01:05:16.833
Where is he now?

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:18.667
He's at a safe place.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.208
But he's probably not doing so well
because he's badly shot.

01:05:22.292 --> 01:05:23.750
Do you find this situation funny?

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:25.333
Or, do you just joke about everything?

01:05:25.417 --> 01:05:28.458
If something bad happens to him,
and they blame you people for it,

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:30.625
we'll be forced to go to war.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:33.542
Do you think
you'll still be able to crack jokes then?

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:34.625
I know. I know that.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.875
I'm aware of the fact
that there will be war if he dies.

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:40.583
I have two kids, for God's sake.
Of course I take this seriously.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:44.042
Calm down already.

01:05:44.542 --> 01:05:47.458
They can't operate on him
until his brain pressure goes down.

01:05:50.042 --> 01:05:52.458
Hang on. I need to check this.
What's he doing?

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.708
Why is he stopped there?
We're in Uijeongbu.

01:05:56.333 --> 01:05:57.833
You said they would use a tunnel.

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.167
You guys dug the tunnel all the way here?

01:06:05.792 --> 01:06:07.292
I don't know the exact locations.

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:11.542
Do people in the North eat moles
by any chance?

01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:16.875
No, we don't eat shit like that.
We eat rice and meat soup.

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:20.958
Then, why are you people so good
at digging underground tunnels?

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.375
You guys should dig all the subway tunnels
when we're reunified.

01:06:32.667 --> 01:06:33.958
He must be around here.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:38.958
UIJEONGBU ARMY STEW

01:06:39.042 --> 01:06:40.667
ARMY STEW WITH 35 YEARS OF HISTORY

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:42.083
SPECIALIZED IN ARMY STEW

01:06:42.167 --> 01:06:43.833
You folks have built so many army bases

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:45.500
to prepare for war.

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:47.708
How many mess halls are there
in this area?

01:06:48.292 --> 01:06:49.292
Hey, you commie.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:54.375
Those restaurants aren't mess halls.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:57.208
A dish called "army stew" was invented
back in the time

01:06:57.292 --> 01:07:00.750
when our dads and uncles
had to fight each other in the war.

01:07:00.833 --> 01:07:03.375
It was made with foods scrounged
from the US army bases.

01:07:04.792 --> 01:07:07.958
I knew it. You people built those
army bases with the Americans' help.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:12.500
Forget it. What do I even expect?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.250
Unbelievable.
What is wrong with those people?

01:07:19.333 --> 01:07:22.458
At a critical time like this?
They're such slackers.

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:27.042
Goodness, I was wondering
why they stopped here. They had lunch.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:31.833
Commie, aren't you hungry?

01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.542
-No, I'm not.
-Let's grab a bite to eat, too.

01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:40.708
We'll act like we ran into them there
to sit in the meeting.

01:07:40.792 --> 01:07:42.875
We'll have to go back
if they see us here now.

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:47.125
A restaurant I used to frequent back
when I was in the military is nearby.

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.167
Let's go. Come on.
It's that restaurant over there.

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.542
MANGHYANG NOODLES

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.167
Gosh, I haven't been here for ages.

01:08:09.875 --> 01:08:11.042
What's wrong?

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:17.042
Dig in.

01:08:48.042 --> 01:08:49.375
Give me your hand.

01:09:02.207 --> 01:09:03.375
We're a team, okay?

01:09:04.082 --> 01:09:05.250
We're working together.

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:08.707
Move over.

01:09:37.917 --> 01:09:39.792
Excuse me.
Another bowl of noodle soup, please.

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:42.625
Well, we should get dumplings, too.

01:09:57.042 --> 01:09:58.042
Jeez.

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:03.750
You're inhaling the noodles.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:10.875
I haven't eaten anything
since I left Kaesong.

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:14.458
Also...

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:20.833
That burger or whatever it's called.
You ate the whole thing, remember?

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:24.875
I didn't say anything. Eat all you want.

01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:29.292
Eat up.

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:36.958
They make good skinny noodles here.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:39.083
"Skinny noodles"? What is that?

01:10:39.792 --> 01:10:41.458
Excuse me. We ordered dumplings, too.

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.208
That's called skinny noodles.

01:10:47.917 --> 01:10:49.500
Are you a defector, too?

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:52.292
He came down here only a little while ago.

01:10:53.167 --> 01:10:54.542
Where are all the customers?

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:56.833
Has everyone fled already?

01:10:57.417 --> 01:10:58.667
Shouldn't you head south too?

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.625
Goodness, there will be no safe place
on this land if a war breaks out.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:07.542
I'm more worried about my family
in the North.

01:11:19.833 --> 01:11:21.333
I'll uncuff you.

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:23.500
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

01:11:29.625 --> 01:11:30.625
Give it to me.

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:42.667
Hey, wait up.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:47.917
Oh, no. My scarf.

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:54.292
My ex-wife gave it to me as a gift.

01:11:57.542 --> 01:11:59.083
Do you have a family?

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:01.625
I noticed you left
that information blank on your statement.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.417
I have a 13-year-old girl

01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:13.042
and a ten-year-old boy.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.542
And you've met my ex-wife.

01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:22.625
Why did you and that doctor get divorced?

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.625
Goodness.

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.167
Let's not talk about that, okay?

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.292
Shall we put on some music?

01:12:31.667 --> 01:12:34.750
I have a wife
and an eight-year-old daughter.

01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:42.083
Do you know who G-Dragon is?
I heard that he's a singer.

01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:44.792
Of course I know who he is.
Everyone knows G-Dragon.

01:12:51.625 --> 01:12:54.417
Have you been to the South
before as a spy?

01:12:55.792 --> 01:12:57.375
No, my daughter likes him.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.542
Girls love that guy.

01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:02.958
My daughter also has his songs
downloaded everywhere.

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.667
This is his song. Check it out.

01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:22.083
Is this lousy music really world-famous?

01:13:22.167 --> 01:13:23.208
Did your daughter say that?

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:26.875
Then, just believe her.
I can never win with my daughter either.

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:33.125
<i>Enough of your sweet talks,
I'll misbehave myself tonight</i>

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:34.875
<i>Leave me alone</i>

01:13:34.958 --> 01:13:38.083
<i>I was alone anyway</i>

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:40.042
<i>There's no reason</i>

01:13:40.125 --> 01:13:42.083
<i>There's no sincerity</i>

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:45.625
<i>Enough of your sweet talks</i>

01:14:02.625 --> 01:14:04.167
Are you sure that's Tae-han Ri?

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:07.250
Take a look.
I can't see a thing from here.

01:14:18.917 --> 01:14:20.625
I can't see well from here either.

01:14:22.458 --> 01:14:25.458
Call him now and tell him
that we're close by.

01:14:25.542 --> 01:14:28.292
We need him to invite us
in order to join them.

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.625
Chief Park will flip
if we just show up now.

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:44.292
I honestly can't see a thing.

01:14:44.917 --> 01:14:46.333
Wait, is that him?

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:53.292
What just happened?

01:14:53.667 --> 01:14:54.667
What is going on?

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.375
-Snipers!
-What?

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:01.125
Stay calm.

01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:09.417
Kill them now.

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:14.583
Hang-pil, I'm at the Office
of the former Worker's Party.

01:15:14.667 --> 01:15:15.708
Send troops here now.

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.625
Get in. Hurry!

01:15:23.708 --> 01:15:25.125
Launch the next operation.

01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:09.875
Take this. I'm giving it to you
because I trust you.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:22.417
Now.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:16:58.875
Chief Ri!

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:02.625
Chief Park.

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:05.708
Chief Ri.

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:21.667
Who are you?

01:17:24.417 --> 01:17:25.792
-Who are you...
<i>-Comrade Eom.</i>

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:29.125
<i>If you accomplish this mission,
you'll become a hero</i>

01:17:29.208 --> 01:17:31.625
who saved the country from a coup,
and your family will receive

01:17:31.875 --> 01:17:33.875
the respect and privilege
that come with it.

01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:41.500
-What...
-What the hell is going on?

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:42.875
-What did you do?
-Why is he here?

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:44.250
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:17:44.333 --> 01:17:46.792
It was our only chance to stop the war,
you son of a bitch!

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:48.417
-Why is that commie here?
-What the fuck?

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:49.792
What the hell have you done...

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.500
Hands up! Don't move.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.458
I'm Cheol-u Kwak,
Senior Secretary for National Security.

01:18:27.542 --> 01:18:28.625
Call an ambulance!

01:18:28.917 --> 01:18:29.875
<i>So, you're saying...</i>

01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:33.750
the situation in the North
will get sorted out soon because

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:36.708
the instigator of the coup,
Gwang-dong Park, is dead now.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:40.542
Is that what the guy who brought
Number One here said?

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:43.375
-Yes, sir. That's correct.
-Where is he now?

01:18:43.458 --> 01:18:46.458
He fell unconscious because he lost
too much blood. He's being treated now.

01:18:46.542 --> 01:18:47.375
Is that so?

01:18:50.667 --> 01:18:54.625
National Security Chief Byeong-jin Park
was recording this

01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:56.458
until the moment he died.

01:18:57.625 --> 01:18:59.458
<i>How's our leader?</i>

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:02.458
<i>He's being treated at the moment.
Let's gauge the situation first.</i>

01:19:02.667 --> 01:19:05.000
<i>A few traitors in our army
instigated a coup.</i>

01:19:05.292 --> 01:19:08.542
<i>I have full control over Pyongyang,
our nukes, and the strategic forces,</i>

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:10.250
<i>so please don't worry.</i>

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:11.750
<i>If you send our leader back to us,</i>

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.583
<i>we'll eliminate the traitors
and retract the declaration...</i>

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:20.000
They've always been like this.

01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:21.833
They told us that they wanted to talk,

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:23.833
while they attacked
and sank our Cheonan warship.

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:26.417
Those scoundrels bombed
Yeonpyeong Island, for God's sake.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.667
What we know for certain
is that they have declared war on us

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.667
and that they have nuclear weapons.

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:33.125
There's one more thing, sir.

01:19:33.208 --> 01:19:36.250
We have their leader, sir.

01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:37.500
We also know that

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:41.375
some of them are trying their best
to prevent the war and sort out the mess.

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:43.000
I do not trust them.

01:19:43.708 --> 01:19:46.667
I would much rather talk with our allies
who have been in this with us.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.625
So, are you saying you'll push ahead
with the preemptive nuclear attack?

01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:52.875
Then, what do you want to do? Will you
endanger the lives of 50 million people

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.417
for a 50% chance?

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:58.625
Let's say we can worry about the cost
of war and post-war restoration later.

01:19:58.917 --> 01:19:59.833
If we bomb them...

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.042
Do you think North Koreans
will see us as compatriots

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.667
after we drop nuclear bombs on them?

01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:11.125
Could you please give us some privacy?

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:17.333
Gyeong-yeong, let's be honest now.

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:20.125
A coup has broken out in the North.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:23.000
They have no means to fight back
even if we attack them now.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:25.500
Have we ever had a better reason
and chance to permanently

01:20:25.583 --> 01:20:28.000
eliminate the threat of war
from this peninsula?

01:20:28.667 --> 01:20:32.042
Missing this golden opportunity
is like doing an injustice to our country.

01:20:34.458 --> 01:20:37.625
Gyeong-yeong, please let me do this
before I leave office.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:40.292
Allow me to present this incredible gift
to our people

01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:42.583
and to you,
the next president of this country.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.375
Let me have my way this time.

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:48.167
Both our economy
and population growth rates

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:50.125
are going down at the moment.

01:20:50.625 --> 01:20:51.875
Shall I put it in simpler terms?

01:20:52.583 --> 01:20:53.917
This country is going bust.

01:20:54.542 --> 01:20:58.375
The two Koreas must be reunited.
If you can't understand why,

01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:01.083
try to think about reunification
from economic standpoint at least.

01:21:02.292 --> 01:21:04.458
I absolutely cannot agree
to a preemptive nuclear strike.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.833
I'm glad...

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:10.417
that this is happening
during my presidency.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.583
It's truly unfortunate that

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.917
someone with no historical consciousness
is still the president.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.667
-Excuse me. Mr. Kwak?
-Yes.

01:21:36.833 --> 01:21:39.458
-Are you Mr. Cheol-u Eom's guardian?
-Yes, I am.

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:43.917
From his chest X-ray, we discovered
that he has metastatic lung cancer.

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:46.292
We also did a CT scan on his abdomen

01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:48.917
and found out that he has
stage four pancreatic cancer as well.

01:21:49.208 --> 01:21:51.958
The cancer has already spread
to his spine,

01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:54.167
so he could experience
neurogenic shock, too.

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:57.208
To be honest, he could die any minute.

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:03.208
<i>Do you think that</i>

01:22:03.958 --> 01:22:05.083
<i>he's aware of his condition?</i>

01:22:06.083 --> 01:22:07.500
<i>I'm sure he does.</i>

01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:09.625
<i>He must have been in extreme pain.</i>

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:14.292
Hey.

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:16.542
Gosh.

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:19.708
How are you feeling?

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:23.583
-I'm feeling good.
-Great.

01:22:24.292 --> 01:22:25.500
I slept well for a change.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.542
How's the bullet wound?
It must hurt a lot.

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.667
They must have given me
a ton of analgesic injections.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.542
I don't feel any pain.

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:39.083
That's good.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.167
I'm glad to hear that, but...

01:22:48.917 --> 01:22:49.958
But...

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:55.292
Why did you kill Gwang-dong Park?

01:22:55.792 --> 01:22:57.667
That was my mission.

01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:01.833
I was told to kill him
because he's the instigator of the coup.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.083
That's why you killed him?

01:23:05.167 --> 01:23:06.958
Don't you think it's weird though?

01:23:08.125 --> 01:23:11.458
It must have taken him a lot to start
the coup. It was about to succeed,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
but he risked his life
and came down here himself.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:17.500
What are you trying to get at?

01:23:18.792 --> 01:23:21.167
It just doesn't add up.

01:23:22.333 --> 01:23:26.083
Also, coups are usually started
by those in the military.

01:23:26.583 --> 01:23:28.833
I heard that one of your former presidents
was assassinated

01:23:29.042 --> 01:23:30.958
by the KCIA director,
not by a military official.

01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:36.292
Right, but those in the military
did start the coup later.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:37.542
That's what happened here.

01:23:40.292 --> 01:23:41.125
Hello, Mr. Ri.

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:44.750
Yes. All right.

01:23:46.042 --> 01:23:48.625
I have to step out.
Try to get some rest, okay?

01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:54.792
<i>My fellow citizens, nationwide martial law</i>

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:57.375
<i>was declared at 6:00 a.m. today.</i>

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:03.000
<i>Starting today, a mandatory curfew will be
in effect from midnight to 5:00 a.m.</i>

01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:06.208
<i>Please return home as soon as possible.</i>

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:12.125
-Are you going somewhere?
-Yes.

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm going back to China.
I've been told to leave Korea immediately.

01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.583
Since the situation is urgent,

01:24:19.667 --> 01:24:21.958
let's exchange some information
to help each other out.

01:24:22.917 --> 01:24:25.083
How's Number One doing?

01:24:25.167 --> 01:24:26.417
It's 50-50.

01:24:27.375 --> 01:24:30.458
Whom is China supporting as a leader
of the DPRK at the moment?

01:24:30.542 --> 01:24:35.167
We have no choice but to support
the one who has most power over there.

01:24:35.792 --> 01:24:39.333
It sounds like you leaked the information
that Number One is here

01:24:39.542 --> 01:24:42.333
to the rebels as well as
to those who are trying to stop them.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.125
If I had known,
I wouldn't have let it happen.

01:24:46.417 --> 01:24:49.250
It looks like the higher-ups did it
whether it was a mistake or not.

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:50.708
The coup was...

01:24:52.292 --> 01:24:53.667
started by the military, wasn't it?

01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:58.125
Number One has killed hundreds
of generals since he came into power.

01:24:59.208 --> 01:25:03.375
Also, he practically has sole control
over their nuclear weapons as well.

01:25:04.792 --> 01:25:06.167
Then, who do you think it is?

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:09.833
If we bomb them,
will China think of us as their enemy?

01:25:10.417 --> 01:25:11.875
What information can you give me?

01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:14.000
Gwang-dong Park died
when he came down here.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.333
That I know.

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:19.083
The current president does not want
to expand north after the strike.

01:25:19.167 --> 01:25:20.708
I guess the next president will.

01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:24.792
He won't be able to
if it's a nuclear strike.

01:25:25.458 --> 01:25:27.042
We, Koreans,

01:25:27.917 --> 01:25:31.125
will have no choice but to be dragged
into the cold war system once again.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:34.708
You're Korean too.

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:35.625
So what?

01:25:37.042 --> 01:25:39.333
Since when did you Korean people
treat us as brothers?

01:25:40.292 --> 01:25:42.917
Don't you folks only consider
the rich ones as your brothers?

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:45.875
Ethnically, I am Korean,

01:25:45.958 --> 01:25:48.000
but I consider myself 100% Chinese.

01:25:48.083 --> 01:25:51.583
My country has been maintaining
a consistent stance on this matter.

01:25:51.667 --> 01:25:53.583
We will absolutely not allow the US

01:25:54.167 --> 01:25:57.250
or any of their military allies
to share our borders with us.

01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:01.542
If the DPRK is destroyed by nukes,
we'll have to take their people in.

01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:05.667
Let me give you
one last piece of information.

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:09.958
China doesn't like that idea.

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.000
If we take their people in,

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:14.417
our power will be dispersed.

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:19.333
That's precisely what the American
and Japanese people want.

01:26:31.333 --> 01:26:33.708
Hello. Good evening, Mr. Takashi.

01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:35.583
Hello, Mr. Ri.

01:26:36.167 --> 01:26:37.708
Are you here to depart as well?

01:26:39.792 --> 01:26:41.125
Shall I introduce you two?

01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:42.542
Mr. Kwak.

01:26:43.208 --> 01:26:46.792
This is Mr. Sakai Takashi
from the CIRO in Japan.

01:26:48.625 --> 01:26:50.042
We've known each other for years.

01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:52.208
What's Number One's condition?

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:53.542
I hear it's 50-50.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:55.250
Thank you.

01:27:06.583 --> 01:27:08.250
If you think of me as a fellow Korean,

01:27:09.333 --> 01:27:11.458
I'll give you a word of advice.

01:27:14.292 --> 01:27:17.208
Do not let this war break out.

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:21.625
Escort Mr. Kwak home.

01:27:27.625 --> 01:27:31.417
What about the faculty chair position
at Peking University? Will you do it?

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:48.375
Jeez, I'm so popular today.

01:27:53.125 --> 01:27:56.625
See? Look at all the crap
everyone has to do

01:27:56.708 --> 01:27:58.625
because you people split up this country.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.083
Why should I do this?

01:28:20.625 --> 01:28:22.542
Face up to reality for what?

01:28:54.125 --> 01:28:56.500
Hey, Hang-pil. It's me.
Is everything okay?

01:28:57.250 --> 01:28:59.417
Do you know if they have decided
to bomb the North?

01:29:00.083 --> 01:29:01.875
-See if you can gather some intel.
-Yes.

01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:04.375
<i>The Tag Heuer smart watch
you wanted me to check...</i>

01:29:04.458 --> 01:29:07.083
-Yes.
-Digital Forensics from the NIS called.

01:29:07.167 --> 01:29:08.458
<i>It's not just a watch.</i>

01:29:08.583 --> 01:29:10.500
<i>They haven't been able
to crack the firewall yet,</i>

01:29:10.625 --> 01:29:12.000
<i>but it can generate codes.</i>

01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:13.292
It can generate codes?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.083
A call from the president, sir.
He's on line one.

01:29:21.125 --> 01:29:24.042
<i>NOW WHAT BELONGS TOGETHER
WILL GROW TOGETHER</i>

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.458
Hello, Mr. President.

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:27.458
I'm calling to inform you

01:29:27.542 --> 01:29:30.542
that I have agreed to the nuclear strike
on the North as the president.

01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:31.500
Mr. President.

01:29:31.625 --> 01:29:34.333
<i>The war will begin and end during my term.</i>

01:29:34.417 --> 01:29:36.583
<i>-Sir.</i>
-I'll take full responsibility.

01:29:36.667 --> 01:29:37.542
<i>Sir!</i>

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:54.500
The Chinese and Japanese are already
calling their people back.

01:30:00.417 --> 01:30:01.583
Even the US

01:30:01.833 --> 01:30:04.792
isn't sure if we can pull off
this operation on the North.

01:30:08.292 --> 01:30:14.250
MINOT AIR FORCE BASE

01:30:14.333 --> 01:30:19.125
MERRY CHRISTMAS

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:21.167
THINGS TO FOLLOW UNDER THE MARTIAL LAW

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.083
REFRAIN YOURSELF FROM GOING OUT
UNLESS YOU FALL INTO ONE OF THE CATEGORIES

01:30:28.083 --> 01:30:31.042
The rest of the world is thrown
into panic,

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:35.250
and yet, we have time for a cup of coffee.

01:30:35.333 --> 01:30:37.375
This is one hell of a nation, isn't it?

01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:39.708
May I?

01:31:18.208 --> 01:31:20.583
All I can do is just pray

01:31:20.667 --> 01:31:25.375
that your people will eliminate
the counterattack ability of the North

01:31:25.917 --> 01:31:27.042
or that...

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:31.833
they'll retract their declaration of war.

01:31:43.708 --> 01:31:46.375
I heard that Gwang-dong Park
has joined hands with Cheol-min Choi.

01:31:46.542 --> 01:31:47.542
Cheol-min Choi?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.458
I also found out that he was the one
who leaked our coordinates.

01:31:50.708 --> 01:31:52.125
We should get rid of him right away.

01:31:52.208 --> 01:31:54.958
Don't bother.
Pyongyang is our priority now.

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:59.833
As soon as we get into Pyongyang
and declare ourselves as the new leaders,

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.500
he'll probably take his own life.
Just leave him be.

01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:23.917
What are you waiting for?
Will you shoot me or not?

01:32:25.417 --> 01:32:27.750
Soldiers mustn't be that indecisive.

01:32:30.417 --> 01:32:31.625
Do you have something to say?

01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:33.875
I just guarded Pyongyang
as per the command I received.

01:32:33.958 --> 01:32:36.042
From whom? That's what matters.

01:32:38.708 --> 01:32:40.333
Where's the detonator?

01:32:43.417 --> 01:32:44.583
The code generator.

01:32:48.625 --> 01:32:49.958
There should be two.

01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:53.708
The leader keeps
the other one on him at all times.

01:32:58.375 --> 01:33:00.917
Are you saying
retracting the declaration of war

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:03.250
can stop the nuclear strike?

01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:05.500
Our priority is getting them
to retract it at all costs.

01:33:06.417 --> 01:33:08.375
Without that,
we can't even try to stop it.

01:33:15.292 --> 01:33:16.208
Give me my phone.

01:33:22.083 --> 01:33:24.917
You have many missed calls. Is Tae-han Ri
number one on your speed dial?

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.333
Chief. It's me, Cheol-u.

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:41.542
American nuclear bombers
are on their way now.

01:33:41.625 --> 01:33:42.875
If we retract the declaration...

01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:46.625
Pardon?

01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:51.917
Yes.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.208
I'm at a hospital now.

01:33:57.792 --> 01:34:00.083
Guards? Just one now, sir.

01:34:03.083 --> 01:34:03.958
A watch?

01:34:06.583 --> 01:34:07.833
What kind of watch?

01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:13.042
Yes, I remember.
The Leader was wearing it.

01:34:18.667 --> 01:34:21.042
No, I don't have it,
but I know where it is.

01:34:28.208 --> 01:34:31.875
Then, whom should I meet and where?

01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:37.667
Okay. Got it, sir.

01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:48.208
Call in the hackers.

01:34:48.792 --> 01:34:49.958
What's wrong? What did he say?

01:34:51.917 --> 01:34:54.417
He said he already heard
about the nuclear strike plan from China.

01:34:56.292 --> 01:34:58.958
He also said that they were going
to retract the declaration anyway.

01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:02.792
Oh, I see.

01:35:05.917 --> 01:35:07.000
By the way,

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:10.708
why did he ask you about a watch?
And whom are you meeting?

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:16.542
He was talking about our leader's watch.

01:35:17.458 --> 01:35:19.958
He wants me
to return to the North with it.

01:35:21.333 --> 01:35:22.292
That watch.

01:35:23.792 --> 01:35:25.917
It's a code generator
for nuclear missiles.

01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:27.958
Did you know that?

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:45.292
All the sanctions against us...

01:35:47.458 --> 01:35:49.917
made this attitude spread in our army.

01:35:52.875 --> 01:35:54.792
"Using the nukes will kill us...

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.958
but maybe it's better to use it if we're
all going to starve to death anyway."

01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:03.917
Hence, the military devised
a last-resort strategy.

01:36:05.208 --> 01:36:07.417
They decided to use Seoul
and the US Armed Forces in Korea

01:36:07.833 --> 01:36:10.083
if they can't use the nukes
to negotiate with the world.

01:36:10.667 --> 01:36:11.583
What does that mean?

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.833
If we set off a nuclear rocket
over Daejeon,

01:36:16.917 --> 01:36:17.833
STRIKE PLAN ON SOUTH KOREA

01:36:17.917 --> 01:36:20.792
<i>all communication equipment
in the South will burn,</i>

01:36:20.958 --> 01:36:23.833
<i>and all of your cutting-edge weapons
will be turned into scrap metal.</i>

01:36:24.625 --> 01:36:27.833
<i>While that's going on, 250,000 soldiers
from our special forces will seize Seoul</i>

01:36:27.917 --> 01:36:29.375
<i>and capture US soldiers.</i>

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.708
<i>Then, the US will have no choice
but to negotiate with us.</i>

01:36:34.208 --> 01:36:36.750
Our military thought
that it's the only way...

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:40.375
to protect our country.

01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:43.417
But...

01:36:44.667 --> 01:36:47.083
our leader didn't implement the strategy,

01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:50.375
and some military authorities grumbled.

01:36:53.667 --> 01:36:55.292
They criticized him and said that...

01:36:56.458 --> 01:36:58.417
he, like his predecessors,
intends to use the nukes

01:36:59.208 --> 01:37:01.417
to maintain his power
and not for the Republic.

01:37:05.875 --> 01:37:07.042
There's this saying.

01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:12.333
"People of a divided nation suffer more

01:37:13.167 --> 01:37:16.250
from those who use the division
for their political gain...

01:37:17.583 --> 01:37:19.125
than the division itself."

01:37:25.417 --> 01:37:27.083
Telling me to bring the watch...

01:37:30.458 --> 01:37:32.500
It means that he'll carry out the plan.

01:37:34.708 --> 01:37:36.083
How long will it take?

01:37:36.167 --> 01:37:38.250
I'll have a better idea in a bit, but...

01:37:39.542 --> 01:37:40.583
I guess about three months?

01:37:47.708 --> 01:37:49.417
How old are you?

01:37:50.417 --> 01:37:53.083
-I'm 19 years old, sir.
-You're 19?

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.375
I see. Maybe you're too young to know.

01:37:58.250 --> 01:37:59.625
I'll explain.

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:01.292
Attention!

01:38:04.042 --> 01:38:08.250
Two decades ago,
three million people died on this land.

01:38:09.292 --> 01:38:11.250
How? They died of starvation.

01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:16.333
But you know what? That did not stop us

01:38:16.708 --> 01:38:18.667
from making the nuclear rockets.

01:38:19.583 --> 01:38:22.708
Now, they're all ready to be launched.

01:38:23.792 --> 01:38:25.833
If you guys can't break the codes,

01:38:26.042 --> 01:38:29.083
it means that the nukes
are basically useless.

01:38:29.167 --> 01:38:31.417
How ridiculous is that?

01:38:34.125 --> 01:38:37.958
If I were one of those American bastards,
I would never miss this opportunity.

01:38:39.292 --> 01:38:40.125
Three months?

01:38:40.833 --> 01:38:41.667
All right.

01:38:42.417 --> 01:38:45.083
The Americans will kill you anyway,
so you should just die now.

01:38:45.167 --> 01:38:48.458
Cracking the entire system
will take about three months,

01:38:48.792 --> 01:38:53.083
but if I tackle each digit at a time,
I should be able to do it in a week, sir.

01:38:53.167 --> 01:38:54.167
I'll give you one day.

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:56.292
Yes, sir.

01:39:49.042 --> 01:39:50.125
China is fuming.

01:39:50.208 --> 01:39:53.667
They want us to retract the declaration
as the nuclear bombers are on their way.

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.542
It'll be announced soon.

01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:59.167
And...

01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:02.500
We now know where it is,

01:40:03.708 --> 01:40:04.708
so send our guys there.

01:40:10.417 --> 01:40:11.792
Salute. May I see some ID, please?

01:40:11.875 --> 01:40:13.958
-We're from Security Service.
-Open the gates!

01:40:25.208 --> 01:40:27.500
-Attention.
-Salute!

01:40:27.583 --> 01:40:28.417
At ease.

01:40:34.792 --> 01:40:36.833
ARMED FORCES CAPITAL HOSPITAL

01:40:40.542 --> 01:40:43.292
<i>The Supreme Command of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea</i>

01:40:43.375 --> 01:40:47.667
<i>nullifies Gwang-dong Park's
declaration of war</i>

01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:50.792
<i>and suggests talks
with the Republic of Korea</i>

01:40:50.917 --> 01:40:53.333
<i>in order to ease the tension
in this quasi-state of war.</i>

01:40:53.417 --> 01:40:54.750
The president called for you, sir.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.417
We presume that it's North Korea.

01:41:29.542 --> 01:41:31.750
Please stay in the bunker
until the situation clears.

01:41:32.042 --> 01:41:34.917
Team One and Two, to the Blue House.
Get in!

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:35.833
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

01:41:36.917 --> 01:41:38.750
What? The Blue House was attacked?

01:41:40.042 --> 01:41:41.208
By who? How bad is it?

01:41:42.833 --> 01:41:43.708
You don't know?

01:41:44.875 --> 01:41:47.250
It's a decoy.
This hospital is their real target.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.208
Get ready.

01:41:54.333 --> 01:41:56.000
Stop! Stop right there!

01:41:56.083 --> 01:41:57.708
-What's going on?
-It's an emergency.

01:41:57.792 --> 01:41:59.958
Only authorized personnel can go in now.

01:42:00.042 --> 01:42:02.375
He's injured badly.
He'll die if he's not treated right away.

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:05.333
-Corporal Kim, go check.
-Yes, sir.

01:43:54.417 --> 01:43:55.875
Bring all the bodies!

01:47:10.042 --> 01:47:10.958
Don't move!

Come on, let's go.

01:47:35.167 --> 01:47:37.208
-Please move him and finish the surgery.
-Yes, sir.

01:47:38.625 --> 01:47:39.458
This way.

01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:45.083
I'm from National Security.

01:47:47.208 --> 01:47:50.417
He's with us! He's been working with us.
It's okay.

01:47:51.417 --> 01:47:52.250
Are you all right?

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:54.708
Where's our leader?

01:47:55.958 --> 01:47:57.542
He's being moved to another hospital.

01:47:59.042 --> 01:48:02.792
<i>Confirmed dead...</i>

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.042
Sit down.

01:48:18.042 --> 01:48:21.208
This shows that they're determined
to start the war no matter what.

01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:23.833
Use me as bait.

01:48:23.917 --> 01:48:25.583
I'll go meet with Tae-han Ri.

01:48:25.667 --> 01:48:27.917
Put a location tracker on the watch
and give it to me.

01:48:28.583 --> 01:48:31.708
Then, bomb my location.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.292
Sir, we have accessed the first one.

01:48:46.833 --> 01:48:47.833
Prepare to launch it.

01:49:03.458 --> 01:49:08.417
China says that the information they're
about to give us might put them at risk

01:49:09.417 --> 01:49:12.292
of exposing their intelligence network
and their top-notch technologies

01:49:12.417 --> 01:49:14.042
which took them 20 years to build.

01:49:15.167 --> 01:49:16.875
They would like us
to remember their kindness

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.917
and our blood alliance with them.

01:49:20.458 --> 01:49:25.375
They're obviously doing it to humiliate
the US through us. How obnoxious.

01:49:26.750 --> 01:49:27.625
Give me that.

01:49:30.333 --> 01:49:31.292
Deliver this message.

01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:36.000
North Korea and China
are brothers that have been

01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:39.292
fighting against Japan
and the US together...

01:49:40.333 --> 01:49:44.708
and we will always remain brothers.

01:49:45.583 --> 01:49:48.917
North Korea will never forget this favor.

01:50:46.125 --> 01:50:47.958
The missiles have entered the East Sea.

01:50:48.042 --> 01:50:50.542
-They'll give us the coordinates.
-Change the coordinates.

01:50:51.042 --> 01:50:55.333
Sir, this isn't Daejeon.
It's in the middle of the sea.

01:50:55.417 --> 01:50:59.708
The American bastards
fired nuclear missiles at our republic!

01:50:59.792 --> 01:51:01.083
Launch it immediately!

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.167
Yes, sir. Prepare to intercept.

01:51:25.292 --> 01:51:26.750
Prepared to intercept!

01:51:27.583 --> 01:51:28.917
-Fire.
-Fire!

01:52:31.708 --> 01:52:33.833
Quiet. Be quiet!

01:52:35.708 --> 01:52:37.125
Get back to work now.

01:52:40.958 --> 01:52:43.667
Announce the following
on Central Television.

01:52:44.708 --> 01:52:47.583
"Today, we utterly crushed

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.750
the American invaders'
wicked plan to annihilate us."

01:52:51.833 --> 01:52:54.625
<i>We witnessed the proof
of what can happen to our country</i>

01:52:54.708 --> 01:52:56.833
<i>without our nuclear weapons.</i>

01:52:57.042 --> 01:53:00.167
<i>Our nuclear weapons are for self-defense,
not for offense.</i>

01:53:00.583 --> 01:53:04.625
<i>However,
if they dare to attack us once again,</i>

01:53:04.708 --> 01:53:07.208
-Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.
<i>-we'll fire all the nuclear rockets</i>

01:53:07.292 --> 01:53:10.375
<i>at Japan and punish them
for helping the US</i>

01:53:10.458 --> 01:53:11.583
-Yes, sir.
<i>-by...</i>

01:53:11.667 --> 01:53:14.167
<i>making sure they're
wiped off the face of the earth for good.</i>

01:53:14.250 --> 01:53:16.667
But why at Japan, sir?

01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:22.750
The Americans listen to the Japanese
more than us, you know.

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:24.750
Yes, sir.

01:53:32.333 --> 01:53:36.042
A North Korean nuclear missile
just exploded over the East Sea.

01:53:40.667 --> 01:53:42.083
They probably hacked one.

01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:44.625
South Korea will be the next target
if they hack another code.

01:53:44.708 --> 01:53:46.333
Listen, Comrade Kwak.

01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:49.792
Leak false information
that the leader is dead.

01:53:50.375 --> 01:53:52.125
If they think
their assassination plan worked,

01:53:53.125 --> 01:53:55.167
it'll buy us some time.

01:53:56.583 --> 01:53:57.583
Comrade, please.

01:53:58.958 --> 01:54:02.292
The longer I stay here,
the more dangerous it will get.

01:54:04.417 --> 01:54:06.417
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

01:54:16.375 --> 01:54:18.000
Number One died.

01:54:36.542 --> 01:54:39.500
-Hey, what's going on? Did he really die?
-No, he didn't.

01:54:39.583 --> 01:54:42.417
We moved him to another hospital.
He'll undergo surgery soon.

01:54:45.917 --> 01:54:47.417
Everyone here is going nuts.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.042
The president requested another strike
on the North,

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.792
but the US won't do it.

01:55:08.917 --> 01:55:11.583
You know that they fired the missile
after the retraction.

01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.375
How can you spew such nonsense now?

01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:17.833
Is our alliance worth nothing
compared to your relationship with Japan?

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.708
Do you think...

01:55:36.917 --> 01:55:40.250
that bombing North Korea can destroy
all of their nuclear weapons?

01:55:42.208 --> 01:55:43.583
Even if they manage to launch...

01:55:44.667 --> 01:55:46.417
just one of them...

01:55:54.042 --> 01:55:55.708
The two of you never gave me permission.

01:55:55.792 --> 01:55:57.458
I'll take full responsibility.

01:55:58.958 --> 01:56:01.458
No, you have my permission.

01:56:01.542 --> 01:56:03.667
Let's try everything we can do.

01:56:11.417 --> 01:56:12.458
Are you feeling better?

01:56:17.625 --> 01:56:20.167
It looks like you're fully recovered.

01:56:23.958 --> 01:56:25.458
Do you mind stepping out for a minute?

01:56:30.542 --> 01:56:34.167
They removed the code generator
and installed a tracker on it.

01:56:34.250 --> 01:56:36.458
I heard it can detect signals
from up to 200m underground.

01:56:36.542 --> 01:56:38.500
It's made of some radioactive material.

01:56:39.083 --> 01:56:40.708
You see this red button, right?

01:56:41.458 --> 01:56:44.917
Pressing the button will reset the system.

01:56:45.833 --> 01:56:47.833
When we see that,
we'll know that you're there.

01:56:51.708 --> 01:56:54.375
Wearing it all the time
isn't good for you. Give me that.

01:56:54.458 --> 01:56:56.500
Thanks for your concern.

01:56:59.125 --> 01:57:00.083
But why?

01:57:02.625 --> 01:57:04.625
Because I might die from the radiation?

01:57:07.583 --> 01:57:10.667
No, I'm worried about myself.
I don't want to die from the radiation.

01:57:14.042 --> 01:57:15.000
Hey, wait.

01:57:17.167 --> 01:57:18.750
-Wear this.
-I don't need it.

01:57:19.625 --> 01:57:23.167
You're in South Korea. Do you want
to advertise that you're a commie?

01:57:24.667 --> 01:57:25.542
Here.

01:57:41.667 --> 01:57:45.167
Hey, Cheol-u.
So, what does your name mean?

01:57:48.292 --> 01:57:51.417
It means "strong friendship."

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.500
You said yours means
"bright world," right?

01:57:58.833 --> 01:58:00.083
Great memory.

01:58:00.167 --> 01:58:02.583
I didn't think you were listening
because you were in pain.

01:58:06.625 --> 01:58:09.500
Hey, tell me a funny story or something.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.542
I don't know any stories.

01:58:12.042 --> 01:58:13.917
So, I have to lighten up the mood?

01:58:17.125 --> 01:58:19.958
What does a king do when
he doesn't want to return to his palace?

01:58:22.125 --> 01:58:23.375
How would I know?

01:58:27.542 --> 01:58:29.875
He grunts and grumbles.

01:58:34.875 --> 01:58:40.708
What's the name of the town in Seoul
where chubby people live?

01:58:41.167 --> 01:58:42.542
Is there actually a town like that?

01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:47.208
Banpo-dong.
"Banpo" sounds like "chubby," you know.

01:58:50.333 --> 01:58:56.250
Then, what's the name of the town
where fat people live?

01:59:00.292 --> 01:59:01.167
Gaepo-dong.

01:59:01.292 --> 01:59:03.833
Wow, how did you know? I'm impressed.

01:59:05.458 --> 01:59:07.167
You've been here as a spy, haven't you?

01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:10.250
Do they still reward
those who report spies?

01:59:10.708 --> 01:59:14.333
Well, I have watched
the famous comedy show a few times.

01:59:15.125 --> 01:59:17.125
Goodness, you little...

01:59:17.667 --> 01:59:21.042
You scold your daughter
for listening to South Korean music,

01:59:21.542 --> 01:59:22.917
while you watch all the fun stuff.

01:59:29.958 --> 01:59:30.958
Comrade Eom.

01:59:31.667 --> 01:59:32.875
What? Comrade Kwak.

01:59:37.167 --> 01:59:38.792
You have to make it out
in one piece, okay?

01:59:45.542 --> 01:59:46.917
And put on some weight, will you?

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:48.958
I'll lose some.

01:59:51.125 --> 01:59:54.708
That way,
we can live in Banpo-dong together.

01:59:57.083 --> 01:59:58.958
We'll drink soju together
from time to time.

02:00:06.125 --> 02:00:10.083
By the way, what on earth
is G-Dragon saying in his song?

02:00:13.125 --> 02:00:14.375
I'm not sure either.

02:00:44.208 --> 02:00:45.417
Here you go.

02:00:56.333 --> 02:00:57.417
May I borrow that?

02:01:00.167 --> 02:01:01.000
My credit card?

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.625
I probably won't be able to pay you back.

02:01:04.917 --> 02:01:06.042
Can you let me use it?

02:01:21.417 --> 02:01:22.458
Thanks a lot.

02:01:49.958 --> 02:01:52.042
This is the address you gave me.

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:13.833
I'll be going, then.

02:02:15.708 --> 02:02:19.208
Are you sure this is the right place?
What if it isn't?

02:02:19.458 --> 02:02:20.458
I think this is it.

02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:24.083
I'll wait for you here just in case.

02:02:25.375 --> 02:02:28.083
No, let's just part ways here.

02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:37.792
Damn, what a coldhearted commie.

02:02:41.333 --> 02:02:43.458
What is it?
Did we come to the wrong place?

02:02:43.792 --> 02:02:44.958
Cheol-u.

02:02:45.042 --> 02:02:49.208
Gosh, it feels so weird to hear you
saying my name.

02:02:51.667 --> 02:02:55.083
If everything goes well,
please send the girl back to the North.

02:02:56.208 --> 02:02:57.708
Her family must be waiting for her.

02:02:58.833 --> 02:03:00.375
Of course, I will.

02:03:01.208 --> 02:03:04.708
You should be good to your family, too.
Reconcile with your ex-wife.

02:03:05.250 --> 02:03:08.042
-She seemed like a very good person.
-I know that.

02:03:09.042 --> 02:03:10.875
Hey, you forgot your stuff in the car.

02:03:12.167 --> 02:03:13.250
Cheol-u.

02:03:14.208 --> 02:03:15.125
Yes.

02:03:15.958 --> 02:03:16.875
Those things...

02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:20.375
If all goes well...

02:03:22.458 --> 02:03:23.333
and...

02:03:25.708 --> 02:03:27.458
if travel is allowed
between the two Koreas.

02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.458
Please send them...

02:03:31.792 --> 02:03:33.417
to this address.

02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:40.333
21-3 Chollima Pyongsong North Pyongan

02:03:41.083 --> 02:03:42.583
The pale pink one is for my daughter,

02:03:42.667 --> 02:03:44.208
and the navy one is for my wife.

02:03:52.042 --> 02:03:53.875
Thank you for everything, Cheol-u.

02:04:17.250 --> 02:04:18.542
Cheol-u from the North!

02:04:20.917 --> 02:04:21.917
Goodbye.

02:04:23.833 --> 02:04:24.875
Take care of yourself.

02:04:34.042 --> 02:04:35.125
I'm sorry.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.375
-Are you Comrade Eom?
-Yes.

02:05:28.125 --> 02:05:29.667
I'm glad you made it back safely.

02:06:30.167 --> 02:06:31.125
<i>At the moment,</i>

02:06:31.208 --> 02:06:35.333
the chief director of the RGB, Tae-han Ri,
is the real power-holder in North Korea.

02:06:35.417 --> 02:06:38.417
We suspect that he and his men
must be directing everything

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:40.500
in a secret underground bunker somewhere,

02:06:40.583 --> 02:06:42.958
but the exact location is unknown
at the moment.

02:06:43.708 --> 02:06:45.250
THE GREAT DPRK

<i>A North Korean named Cheol-u Eom</i>

02:06:49.042 --> 02:06:50.708
<i>brought Number One down here</i>

<i>during the Kaesong

02:06:54.583 --> 02:06:56.583
<i>and asked us for help.</i>

02:06:57.125 --> 02:06:59.250
<i>He's gone back to the North</i>

02:07:00.542 --> 02:07:01.833
<i>in order to meet with Tae-han Ri,</i>

02:07:02.750 --> 02:07:06.583
<i>and we put
a location tracking device on him.</i>

02:07:07.542 --> 02:07:10.625
<i>We're tracking his location live now.</i>

02:07:11.458 --> 02:07:12.792
Well done, Comrade Eom.

02:07:14.083 --> 02:07:15.667
Chief Ri is waiting for you.

02:07:22.958 --> 02:07:24.167
I command

02:07:24.250 --> 02:07:26.708
<i>the Republic's most elite troops.</i>

02:07:27.583 --> 02:07:31.958
<i>Today, we'll get back at the US
and their allies</i>

02:07:32.458 --> 02:07:37.583
<i>for all the hostile deeds

02:07:38.292 --> 02:07:40.083
<i>In a few minutes,</i>

02:07:40.417 --> 02:07:47.083
<i>our nuclear bombs will explode

<i>All of their cherished
American-made weapons</i>

02:07:50.875 --> 02:07:54.250
<i>will be turned into junk.</i>

02:07:54.583 --> 02:07:56.500
<i>Comrades, we should be truly proud of...</i>

02:07:57.417 --> 02:08:00.042
Do you know how many of our people
will be killed by that rocket?

02:08:00.542 --> 02:08:03.917
Our army must protect our people.
How can you kill them?

02:08:05.917 --> 02:08:07.708
Have you turned your coat?

02:08:07.792 --> 02:08:09.750
Why did you betray our leader?

02:08:09.833 --> 02:08:11.792
Who betrayed whom?

02:08:11.875 --> 02:08:16.708
He executed over 100 generals
who didn't even do anything wrong.

02:08:17.042 --> 02:08:18.083
We're the ones

02:08:18.167 --> 02:08:20.625
<i>who were betrayed by him!</i>

02:08:20.708 --> 02:08:25.958
<i>We built this country
and have protected it all these years.</i>

02:08:26.042 --> 02:08:30.500
We have created so many opportunities
to liberate South Korea,

02:08:30.583 --> 02:08:35.750
and we even made nuclear weapons,
but he just won't use them!

02:08:38.458 --> 02:08:40.875
A friend I made in the South told me this.

02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:46.500
"People of a divided nation suffer more
from those who try to use

02:08:46.583 --> 02:08:49.375
the division for their gain
than the division itself."

02:08:51.917 --> 02:08:55.083
I witnessed the suffering
with my own eyes in Kaesong.

02:08:57.375 --> 02:09:01.583
I cannot let the entire country
suffer like that.

02:09:29.583 --> 02:09:30.875
Please give us the go-ahead...

02:09:32.458 --> 02:09:33.417

the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

02:11:42.958 --> 02:11:44.083
He's waiting inside.

02:11:47.625 --> 02:11:49.500
Thank you for coming
all the way here, Mr. Kwak.

02:11:49.583 --> 02:11:52.417
-How's our leader?
-He's gotten a lot better.

02:11:52.917 --> 02:11:55.667
Then, he should return soon.

02:11:57.750 --> 02:12:01.125
I'm sure he'll recover sooner
if peace can be guaranteed

02:12:01.667 --> 02:12:03.250
between the North and the South.

02:12:10.583 --> 02:12:12.000
May I help you?

02:12:12.083 --> 02:12:14.417
You have a guest from South Korea.

02:12:19.542 --> 02:12:20.417
Hello.

02:12:24.167 --> 02:12:26.250
Are you moving?

02:12:26.833 --> 02:12:31.083
Yes, I'll be working
at the embassy in Cuba.

02:12:36.292 --> 02:12:37.875
You must be In-yeong.

02:12:41.042 --> 02:12:43.000
In-yeong, come out and say hello.

02:12:47.708 --> 02:12:49.667
Hello.

02:13:02.417 --> 02:13:05.167
I'm your dad's friend.

02:13:07.125 --> 02:13:08.208
We even have the same name.

02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.333
I'm Cheol-u, too.

02:13:10.625 --> 02:13:13.042
My name is Cheol-u Kwak.

02:13:14.917 --> 02:13:18.708
Here. They're for you and your mom.

02:13:20.417 --> 02:13:21.708
Your dad sent them.

02:13:21.792 --> 02:13:23.083
My daddy sent them?

02:13:27.083 --> 02:13:30.000
Yes, your daddy.

02:13:44.083 --> 02:13:45.333
Thank you for everything.

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:47.583
I'm Se-yeong Jeong,
Minister of Unification.

02:13:47.667 --> 02:13:50.292
I'm Premier Ki-hyeon Park.

02:13:59.833 --> 02:14:01.458
<i>Guaranteed peace?</i>

02:14:01.542 --> 02:14:03.375
How can we ensure that?

02:14:05.042 --> 02:14:08.625
Give us half of your nuclear weapons.

02:14:10.542 --> 02:14:15.500
It'll guarantee the end of both Koreas
if we go to war,

02:14:16.625 --> 02:14:20.708
and we'll enter an era of peace
in order to avoid that.

02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:29.667
Yes, we got them.

02:14:31.708 --> 02:14:32.542
Repatriate him.

02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:31.083
