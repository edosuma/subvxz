03:38.425 --> 03:39.968
Check, charge or cash?

03:40.177 --> 03:41.219
Cash.

03:43.513 --> 03:45.015
Make it out to...

03:45.223 --> 03:47.059
Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

03:47.517 --> 03:49.061
$788.30.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.432
Taking me to breakfast?

05:41.807 --> 05:43.434
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

05:44.894 --> 05:46.145
Hey, Vincent.

05:46.437 --> 05:47.813
Where are my barrettes?

05:48.147 --> 05:50.107
I saw them on the kitchen table.

05:50.399 --> 05:51.692
I already checked.

05:52.193 --> 05:53.277
Coffee?

05:53.486 --> 05:54.537
No school today?

05:54.663 --> 05:57.832
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.626
Try under the sofa cushions.

06:03.505 --> 06:05.548
He's already half an hour late.

06:06.174 --> 06:09.302
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

06:09.678 --> 06:10.845
I'll make coffee.

06:11.137 --> 06:12.264
Out of time.

06:25.026 --> 06:27.570
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.323
Wear the blue ones.

06:30.740 --> 06:33.410
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

06:33.535 --> 06:36.329
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

06:36.454 --> 06:37.831
What do you want me to do?

06:37.956 --> 06:39.082
Find them!

06:39.249 --> 06:42.127
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

06:42.335 --> 06:44.045
Daddy's going to be here.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.338
I won't be ready!

06:45.463 --> 06:47.048
- I can't be late.
- You won't.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.800
I will be late!

06:49.134 --> 06:51.970
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

06:52.095 --> 06:54.681
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.893
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.856
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.952
Give me another refill.

07:27.797 --> 07:28.965
What's your name?

07:29.090 --> 07:30.300
Waingro.

07:39.151 --> 07:40.444
You're Michael?

07:53.499 --> 07:55.709
You guys always work together?

07:56.418 --> 07:57.836
All the time.

07:58.212 --> 07:59.546
Real tight crew?

07:59.755 --> 08:00.839
Real tight.

08:01.924 --> 08:05.386
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

08:05.803 --> 08:08.180
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

08:18.857 --> 08:20.109
How's he doing?

08:20.276 --> 08:21.610
Hundred percent.

08:22.528 --> 08:23.994
Right on schedule.

08:24.619 --> 08:26.496
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

08:28.373 --> 08:30.166
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

08:30.292 --> 08:31.376
Okay.

08:54.065 --> 08:57.068
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

08:57.819 --> 08:58.820
Get set.

08:58.987 --> 09:00.030
I am.

09:09.748 --> 09:10.790
Here we go.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.236
211!

10:12.569 --> 10:14.029
We're being held up!

10:20.035 --> 10:23.372
<i>- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.</i>

10:23.497 --> 10:24.540
<i>Three minutes.</i>

10:26.166 --> 10:27.167
Clear!

11:31.324 --> 11:33.076
Eighty seconds left!

11:34.494 --> 11:36.621
Get back! Get back!

11:37.580 --> 11:38.623
Get back!

11:40.792 --> 11:44.837
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

11:45.004 --> 11:46.089
Cool it!

11:58.351 --> 11:59.477
I got it.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.145
Got it.

12:04.273 --> 12:06.192
You had to fuck with me.

12:06.609 --> 12:08.319
Want to fuck with me?

12:33.641 --> 12:35.439
What are you doing? What did he do?

12:35.564 --> 12:37.024
He was making a move.

12:46.616 --> 12:47.951
Dumb motherfucker.

13:19.024 --> 13:20.150
I heard them.

13:43.298 --> 13:44.841
$1.6 million...

13:45.801 --> 13:48.428
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

13:48.637 --> 13:50.555
Here's $150,000 front money.

13:51.473 --> 13:53.558
Get you the rest in two, three days.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.269
Who owned these?

14:00.273 --> 14:02.234
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

14:02.985 --> 14:04.361
Roger Van Zant.

14:04.486 --> 14:06.279
Owns banks in the Caymans...

14:06.405 --> 14:10.283
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

14:10.575 --> 14:11.618
So?

14:11.827 --> 14:13.713
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

14:13.838 --> 14:15.006
He's insured.

14:16.090 --> 14:19.051
That's the point. He collects
100% from the insurance.

14:19.176 --> 14:21.804
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

14:21.929 --> 14:25.975
for 60% of their value.
Makes 40% on top of the 100%.

14:27.935 --> 14:31.063
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

14:31.939 --> 14:32.982
Try it on.

14:33.983 --> 14:35.067
Kelso called.

14:35.192 --> 14:36.277
About what?

14:36.527 --> 14:39.322
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

14:39.780 --> 14:41.824
I don't need his score. I got my own.

14:42.033 --> 14:44.327
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

14:44.869 --> 14:46.078
9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

14:46.203 --> 14:47.496
What happened?

14:48.956 --> 14:50.166
Don't ask.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.619
Find the ambulance?

15:26.744 --> 15:29.914
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

15:30.873 --> 15:33.876
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

15:36.420 --> 15:40.549
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.221
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

15:45.346 --> 15:48.349
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

15:48.766 --> 15:50.059
You taking this one?

15:50.601 --> 15:52.478
Or does it stay in Division?

15:53.697 --> 15:57.158
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

15:57.283 --> 15:59.160
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

15:59.953 --> 16:01.287
We got three motorists.

16:01.413 --> 16:03.832
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

16:03.957 --> 16:06.501
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

16:08.128 --> 16:09.504
Did he ID anybody?

16:09.629 --> 16:12.090
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.052
What about them?

16:16.803 --> 16:20.056
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

16:20.265 --> 16:21.307
Smart.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.518
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

16:25.103 --> 16:26.438
Now, I figure this guy...

16:26.563 --> 16:29.607
went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

16:30.442 --> 16:31.526
From here...

16:31.943 --> 16:33.069
bang, bang...

16:33.194 --> 16:34.654
bang, bang, bang.

16:35.071 --> 16:36.114
This side.

16:36.406 --> 16:40.994
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

16:41.494 --> 16:44.497
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

16:44.622 --> 16:45.790
Probably executed.

16:47.959 --> 16:50.503
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

16:50.670 --> 16:52.380
They ignored the loose cash.

16:52.505 --> 16:55.300
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

16:55.508 --> 16:58.219
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

16:58.345 --> 17:01.222
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

17:01.848 --> 17:03.975
escaped in under three minutes.

17:04.184 --> 17:06.935
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

17:07.103 --> 17:08.313
Two freeways...

17:08.521 --> 17:09.981
within a quarter of a mile.

17:10.106 --> 17:11.316
Traffic video camera?

17:11.775 --> 17:13.777
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.403
You recognize the M. O?

17:15.528 --> 17:16.695
M. O...

17:16.945 --> 17:18.323
is that they're good.

17:18.698 --> 17:22.911
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

17:23.036 --> 17:24.371
they didn't hesitate.

17:24.496 --> 17:28.415
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

17:28.875 --> 17:30.502
Why leave a living witness?

17:30.794 --> 17:33.680
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock-and-roll.

17:36.725 --> 17:38.352
The shape charge.

17:38.769 --> 17:42.398
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

17:42.523 --> 17:44.692
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

17:44.817 --> 17:48.153
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

17:48.737 --> 17:51.907
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

17:52.032 --> 17:54.868
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

17:56.286 --> 17:59.832
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

17:59.957 --> 18:02.334
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

18:02.543 --> 18:03.919
Hang in with Forensics.

18:04.128 --> 18:06.755
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

18:06.964 --> 18:09.758
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

18:11.427 --> 18:14.054
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

18:22.187 --> 18:23.689
Anyone want some pie?

18:33.365 --> 18:34.908
Gotta go to the john.

19:05.731 --> 19:09.568
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

19:23.174 --> 19:26.302
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

19:27.637 --> 19:29.681
to make up for his full end...

19:30.431 --> 19:34.477
'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

20:13.391 --> 20:14.434
Hold it!

21:54.501 --> 21:55.711
Where's the rest?

21:55.836 --> 21:58.630
We're late. You look too good to go out.

21:59.005 --> 22:00.882
I'll just jump you right here.

22:04.428 --> 22:07.055
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

22:07.305 --> 22:10.392
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

22:10.517 --> 22:11.560
Come on.

22:11.685 --> 22:13.353
You gotta be kidding me.

22:15.063 --> 22:16.189
Honey...

22:16.314 --> 22:21.028
it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

22:21.278 --> 22:22.320
Let's go.

22:22.446 --> 22:23.780
Get your coat.

22:25.782 --> 22:28.869
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

22:29.036 --> 22:30.370
What does that mean?

22:30.704 --> 22:34.717
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

22:34.842 --> 22:37.011
because I married a gambling junkie.

22:37.553 --> 22:39.346
Get in the fucking car.

22:41.140 --> 22:42.808
What am I doing in here?

22:43.309 --> 22:44.351
You're not!

22:44.477 --> 22:47.146
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

22:47.271 --> 22:48.856
in the kitchen on your way out!

22:48.981 --> 22:52.818
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

22:54.987 --> 22:56.697
Don't even think about...

23:21.389 --> 23:24.100
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

23:25.184 --> 23:26.894
Albert Torena call Vincent?

23:28.104 --> 23:29.313
No.

23:29.438 --> 23:30.856
Report came in.

23:31.524 --> 23:34.151
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.</i>

23:34.402 --> 23:36.362
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

23:36.529 --> 23:38.072
Arizona, New Mexico.

23:38.406 --> 23:40.157
Too common to trace a sale.

23:40.533 --> 23:42.118
That's wonderful.

24:02.346 --> 24:03.347
You all right?

24:03.973 --> 24:06.100
What happened? Where have you been?

24:06.726 --> 24:07.768
Work.

24:09.061 --> 24:10.813
Lauren's dad show up?

24:12.565 --> 24:13.608
Didn't call...

24:13.742 --> 24:16.536
didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

24:17.954 --> 24:21.791
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

24:24.335 --> 24:25.545
I don't know.

24:26.588 --> 24:28.006
Fucking jerk.

24:29.758 --> 24:30.967
Is she okay?

24:32.093 --> 24:34.137
She's been in her room all day.

24:34.345 --> 24:36.973
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.059
I made dinner...

24:39.476 --> 24:41.436
for us, four hours ago.

24:43.188 --> 24:46.191
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

24:46.316 --> 24:47.650
you withdraw.

24:48.777 --> 24:52.238
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

24:52.364 --> 24:54.741
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

24:54.991 --> 24:56.326
I'm sorry...

24:56.785 --> 24:58.495
if the goddamn...

24:59.204 --> 25:00.497
chicken...

25:01.289 --> 25:02.916
got overcooked.

25:59.654 --> 26:00.780
Coffee, sir?

26:00.989 --> 26:01.990
Please.

26:07.662 --> 26:09.330
Will you pass the cream?

26:11.958 --> 26:13.043
Thanks.

26:13.168 --> 26:14.377
What'd you get?

26:15.628 --> 26:16.629
What?

26:17.630 --> 26:19.090
What are you reading?

26:24.846 --> 26:26.264
Book about metals.

26:30.060 --> 26:31.936
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

26:34.314 --> 26:35.982
What kind of work do you do?

26:39.152 --> 26:42.405
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

26:46.826 --> 26:48.578
I've seen you in the store.

26:48.703 --> 26:49.954
What store?

26:50.371 --> 26:52.373
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

26:54.334 --> 26:56.795
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

26:57.003 --> 26:58.671
I'm sorry I bothered you.

27:09.057 --> 27:12.185
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

27:13.061 --> 27:15.355
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

27:15.688 --> 27:17.023
My name's Neil.

27:22.362 --> 27:23.530
I'm Eady.

27:26.408 --> 27:27.992
You like working there?

27:29.744 --> 27:30.829
Sure.

27:31.538 --> 27:35.217
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

27:35.426 --> 27:36.510
What area?

27:37.052 --> 27:38.512
Graphic design.

27:39.430 --> 27:42.474
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

27:43.225 --> 27:46.061
the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.855
Who do you do that for?

27:50.941 --> 27:52.359
A restaurant.

27:52.901 --> 27:54.862
I did their menus, and...

27:57.573 --> 27:59.700
a small record label.

28:00.909 --> 28:01.910
CDs.

28:02.453 --> 28:04.204
I've done two so far.

28:06.582 --> 28:08.250
You go to school for that?

28:08.792 --> 28:09.835
Yeah.

28:10.919 --> 28:12.254
I went to Parsons.

28:12.421 --> 28:13.589
Where's that?

28:13.881 --> 28:15.048
New York City.

28:15.883 --> 28:17.468
How long you been here?

28:18.594 --> 28:19.928
About a year.

28:20.929 --> 28:22.056
Like it?

28:23.932 --> 28:26.727
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

28:34.443 --> 28:36.111
Live in this neighborhood?

28:36.236 --> 28:38.989
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

28:41.950 --> 28:43.368
It's a little house I rent.

28:43.494 --> 28:47.081
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

28:48.665 --> 28:49.875
What about you?

28:50.000 --> 28:51.251
I live up here.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.836
That's very funny.

28:57.174 --> 28:59.468
Where's your family from originally?

29:02.012 --> 29:03.764
They're Scotch-Irish.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.767
They emigrated to Appalachia...

29:06.892 --> 29:08.936
in the late 1700s.

29:11.647 --> 29:13.107
Where are you from?

29:13.866 --> 29:15.159
The Bay area.

29:16.661 --> 29:17.995
Your folks there?

29:21.082 --> 29:23.543
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

29:23.668 --> 29:25.211
I don't know where he is.

29:25.336 --> 29:26.963
Got a brother somewhere.

29:32.844 --> 29:34.804
You have a tight family. I can tell.

29:36.180 --> 29:37.181
Right?

29:37.390 --> 29:38.683
You're right.

29:48.526 --> 29:50.153
City of lights.

29:53.573 --> 29:55.116
In Fiji, they have...

29:55.241 --> 29:58.911
iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

30:00.204 --> 30:02.331
That's what it looks like out there.

30:03.583 --> 30:04.876
You been there?

30:06.252 --> 30:08.171
No, I'm going there someday.

30:17.263 --> 30:18.598
You travel a lot?

30:21.559 --> 30:22.602
Yeah.

30:22.977 --> 30:24.729
Traveling make you lonely?

30:29.942 --> 30:31.819
I'm alone. I am not...

30:32.278 --> 30:33.571
lonely.

30:33.946 --> 30:34.989
You?

30:36.616 --> 30:37.992
Real lonely.

32:43.052 --> 32:44.220
Albert!

32:47.014 --> 32:48.057
Shit!

32:49.975 --> 32:52.645
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.897
You were supposed to get back to me.

32:55.022 --> 32:56.816
Where the fuck you been?

32:57.858 --> 32:59.401
I couldn't break free.

32:59.527 --> 33:01.529
Let's violate his ass right now.

33:01.737 --> 33:03.239
I do for you...

33:03.531 --> 33:05.866
you don't do for me, is that it?

33:06.575 --> 33:10.996
Vincent, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

33:11.205 --> 33:13.499
That's got nothing to do with me.

33:13.749 --> 33:18.337
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

33:18.546 --> 33:19.839
You bullshit.

33:20.047 --> 33:22.466
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

33:22.591 --> 33:25.136
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

33:25.261 --> 33:28.139
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

33:28.264 --> 33:31.892
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

33:32.017 --> 33:33.561
You fall in love?

33:35.146 --> 33:36.730
Did you fall in love...

33:36.939 --> 33:38.649
and went off somewhere?

33:38.774 --> 33:40.985
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

33:43.070 --> 33:44.530
Give me all you got!

33:44.905 --> 33:46.574
Give me all you got!

33:46.991 --> 33:50.661
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

33:50.786 --> 33:52.371
I heard Richard?

33:53.122 --> 33:54.790
He's going to talk to you.

33:56.584 --> 33:58.169
He's gonna meet you tonight.

33:58.294 --> 33:59.795
He's not here, is he?

33:59.920 --> 34:01.338
No, he'll meet you tonight.

34:01.464 --> 34:02.965
What happened to now?

34:03.299 --> 34:07.011
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

34:07.136 --> 34:08.179
Bullshit.

34:08.304 --> 34:10.431
I swear. He said no...

34:10.764 --> 34:12.683
'cause he in Phoenix.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.110
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

34:15.820 --> 34:17.489
<i>He'll be rising</i>

34:19.157 --> 34:20.949
<i>He'll probably leave a note</i>

34:21.326 --> 34:22.869
<i>Right on the door</i>

34:22.994 --> 34:25.121
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.460
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

34:31.668 --> 34:32.712
At 2:00 a.m.

34:32.837 --> 34:33.880
Be there.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.590
You be there, too.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.551
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

34:38.676 --> 34:41.513
I got things to do, I got places to be.

34:42.847 --> 34:43.931
Be there.

34:50.063 --> 34:52.232
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

34:56.485 --> 34:57.612
What is it?

34:59.364 --> 35:00.615
It's a bank.

35:00.949 --> 35:04.536
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

35:04.661 --> 35:06.704
to cover Friday payroll checks.

35:06.830 --> 35:09.999
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.626
On the prowl or strong?

35:11.751 --> 35:12.836
Strong. Through the door.

35:12.961 --> 35:14.045
How many guys?

35:14.170 --> 35:17.924
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

35:18.049 --> 35:21.511
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.972
Sounds like a cowboy score.

35:24.180 --> 35:27.725
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.854
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

35:31.187 --> 35:32.981
Two Telco and a cellular.

35:35.024 --> 35:37.694
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

35:38.069 --> 35:39.654
the night before...

35:39.904 --> 35:41.197
you cut in...

35:41.406 --> 35:43.992
and trick out the alarm system computer...

35:44.200 --> 35:45.452
to turn itself...

35:45.577 --> 35:47.662
and the video recorders off...

35:48.037 --> 35:49.998
20 minutes before you enter.

35:50.540 --> 35:52.500
Architectural, electrical plans?

35:52.625 --> 35:53.760
I got that.

35:53.886 --> 35:56.805
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.683
What's the estimate?

36:03.103 --> 36:05.230
$12.1, $12.2 million.

36:08.317 --> 36:09.359
You're on.

36:10.527 --> 36:11.737
Congratulations.

36:12.404 --> 36:16.074
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

36:16.283 --> 36:18.577
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

36:18.952 --> 36:21.747
My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company...

36:21.872 --> 36:23.791
take the bonds back from us...

36:23.916 --> 36:27.419
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40%.</i>

36:29.463 --> 36:32.090
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

36:33.300 --> 36:34.718
Sure, you got a deal.

36:35.511 --> 36:38.847
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

36:39.473 --> 36:42.184
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

36:42.559 --> 36:43.644
Yeah, okay.

36:44.478 --> 36:45.938
Nice talking to you.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.649
You gonna deal with these guys?

36:48.774 --> 36:51.610
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

36:51.735 --> 36:54.154
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

36:54.279 --> 36:57.491
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

37:02.704 --> 37:05.374
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

37:05.499 --> 37:08.710
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

37:08.836 --> 37:10.462
How'd you get this information?

37:10.712 --> 37:11.964
Just comes to you.

37:12.089 --> 37:14.508
This stuff just flies through the air.

37:14.633 --> 37:18.220
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

37:18.345 --> 37:19.930
I know how to grab it.

37:25.853 --> 37:27.479
Okay, here we go.

37:28.021 --> 37:29.481
$13.9 million.

37:33.152 --> 37:34.579
- I bought it.
- Good.

37:35.037 --> 37:36.497
What did I tell you?

37:40.334 --> 37:41.377
Here.

37:42.545 --> 37:45.423
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

37:46.674 --> 37:47.800
How is he?

37:48.217 --> 37:49.677
He's a businessman.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.133
Chris is at my place.

38:32.553 --> 38:33.721
What's wrong?

38:34.055 --> 38:35.890
Husband-and-wife stuff.

38:36.557 --> 38:38.226
I'll let him sleep it off.

38:52.615 --> 38:54.075
What happened to you?

38:58.287 --> 39:00.331
When will you get some furniture?

39:00.456 --> 39:02.125
When I get around to it.

39:04.794 --> 39:06.712
Charlene's gonna leave me.

39:09.132 --> 39:10.174
Why?

39:13.302 --> 39:15.397
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

39:16.439 --> 39:18.483
With everything we've been doing?

39:19.609 --> 39:22.237
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.115
When you gonna get an old lady?

39:25.282 --> 39:26.908
When I get around to it.

39:29.327 --> 39:31.413
You got something else on the side?

39:32.998 --> 39:34.291
Nothing regular.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.419
She got something else on the side?

39:37.544 --> 39:38.837
- No.
- You sure?

39:40.005 --> 39:41.465
Yeah, I'm sure.

39:43.675 --> 39:45.635
I don't know what you're doing.

39:47.179 --> 39:51.224
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

39:51.349 --> 39:54.811
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

39:55.020 --> 39:59.566
"that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

39:59.983 --> 40:01.151
Remember that?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.952
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.385
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

40:27.511 --> 40:30.472
then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

40:30.722 --> 40:32.057
Bank? What bank?

40:32.557 --> 40:35.310
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

40:35.435 --> 40:37.312
That goes, too. Then the bank.

40:41.399 --> 40:42.859
Want some breakfast?

40:50.367 --> 40:51.701
Are you okay?

40:52.202 --> 40:53.537
Yeah, sugar.

41:01.053 --> 41:02.221
For real.

41:02.346 --> 41:03.472
I'll do good.

41:03.722 --> 41:05.141
I'll see you later.

41:21.073 --> 41:22.408
You Solenko?

41:22.825 --> 41:23.909
I'm Don Breedan.

41:24.118 --> 41:28.289
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

41:28.414 --> 41:30.624
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

41:30.749 --> 41:32.418
I'm a great grill man.

41:32.626 --> 41:33.961
Good. Good for you.

41:34.086 --> 41:38.132
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

41:38.257 --> 41:41.677
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

41:41.802 --> 41:43.639
I'll violate you back fast.

41:43.894 --> 41:46.605
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

41:46.730 --> 41:50.942
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

41:57.324 --> 41:59.117
What are you waiting for?

42:18.887 --> 42:20.597
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

42:20.722 --> 42:22.224
Roger Van Zant.

42:22.349 --> 42:23.475
<i>Please hold.</i>

42:27.229 --> 42:29.105
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

42:29.689 --> 42:31.483
I'm supposed to collect something.

42:31.900 --> 42:34.495
Someone will call you back
from another line.

42:36.038 --> 42:38.874
818-133-6089.

43:04.150 --> 43:08.404
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

43:08.654 --> 43:10.614
Just send one man, alone.

43:36.474 --> 43:38.392
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.353
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

43:41.770 --> 43:43.689
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

43:43.856 --> 43:44.982
He's nobody, Neil.

43:45.107 --> 43:48.569
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

43:48.986 --> 43:50.488
Chris will make up.

43:50.613 --> 43:53.240
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

43:54.950 --> 43:58.287
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

43:58.412 --> 44:02.374
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

44:02.625 --> 44:04.752
on my own, anywhere you want.

44:04.919 --> 44:06.587
Dominick will go with you.

44:06.795 --> 44:09.089
And my word counts. But right now...

44:09.465 --> 44:11.759
you will give him the chance.

44:15.980 --> 44:17.607
Clean up. Go home.

44:18.983 --> 44:20.610
Clean up. Go home!

45:06.698 --> 45:07.991
Give me all your money.

45:08.116 --> 45:10.118
You'll get smoked with that shit.

45:10.243 --> 45:11.411
Won't be you.

45:14.622 --> 45:16.666
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

45:47.447 --> 45:49.073
Vincent, hey, man.

45:52.327 --> 45:54.588
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

45:54.755 --> 45:56.215
It's all right.

45:57.466 --> 45:59.343
What have you got for me?

45:59.635 --> 46:04.097
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

46:06.141 --> 46:08.310
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

46:08.477 --> 46:11.688
if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

46:11.813 --> 46:14.942
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

46:15.901 --> 46:18.570
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

46:19.780 --> 46:21.448
I'm a good citizen.

46:21.573 --> 46:23.116
I'm Donald Duck.

46:23.450 --> 46:25.285
You got something to tell me?

46:26.954 --> 46:28.705
Check this out, cuz.

46:29.623 --> 46:32.918
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

46:33.293 --> 46:36.630
that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

46:37.339 --> 46:39.091
Hanna is straight up.

46:39.925 --> 46:42.177
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

46:42.302 --> 46:44.596
And you know because I say so...

46:45.222 --> 46:48.016
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

46:48.141 --> 46:49.226
Fuck you.

46:49.351 --> 46:50.602
You understand?

46:50.894 --> 46:52.855
I can get killed for telling you this.

46:52.980 --> 46:55.190
You can get killed walking your doggie!

46:55.315 --> 46:56.608
All right, man...

46:57.192 --> 46:59.570
there was a cat I was locked up with.

46:59.736 --> 47:04.074
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

47:06.994 --> 47:08.120
And so?

47:08.579 --> 47:11.206
He's a big fiend for action.

47:11.331 --> 47:14.960
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

47:15.085 --> 47:18.463
he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

47:18.589 --> 47:21.341
and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

47:21.466 --> 47:23.427
Right then and there I know...

47:24.011 --> 47:26.638
this cat's got something going down.

47:34.238 --> 47:35.948
Pretty fucking great.

47:37.700 --> 47:39.911
Albert, what's wrong with you?

47:40.661 --> 47:44.123
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

47:44.248 --> 47:47.251
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

47:47.376 --> 47:48.419
That's right.

47:48.544 --> 47:50.004
Well, I am...

47:50.213 --> 47:51.881
over-fucking-whelmed.

47:52.298 --> 47:54.800
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

47:55.218 --> 47:57.553
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

47:58.471 --> 47:59.805
Is he kidding me?

48:01.224 --> 48:02.266
I'm telling you:

48:02.391 --> 48:03.935
This Slick is no joke.

48:04.393 --> 48:05.895
He's double time.

48:06.020 --> 48:07.230
Say what?

48:07.980 --> 48:09.899
"Slick." What does that mean?

48:10.066 --> 48:12.485
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

48:14.111 --> 48:15.738
Tell me about him.

48:17.990 --> 48:19.826
About 6 feet tall...

48:20.117 --> 48:22.078
lots of jailhouse tats.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.330
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

48:26.874 --> 48:28.334
What's his name?

48:29.252 --> 48:30.545
Cheritto.

48:31.295 --> 48:33.422
Michael Cheritto.

48:37.260 --> 48:39.846
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

48:39.971 --> 48:42.515
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.</i>

48:42.682 --> 48:45.309
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.</i>

48:45.434 --> 48:46.602
Three years in Marion.

48:46.727 --> 48:49.981
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

48:50.106 --> 48:51.357
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

48:51.482 --> 48:53.401
Who do I have there now?

48:53.526 --> 48:56.237
<i>- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...</i>

48:56.362 --> 49:00.241
I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

49:00.366 --> 49:02.535
We never close. Open every day.

49:02.785 --> 49:04.579
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

49:04.704 --> 49:06.914
<i>When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...</i>

49:07.039 --> 49:09.500
<i>I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.</i>

49:09.625 --> 49:12.920
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

49:13.421 --> 49:15.891
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

50:11.404 --> 50:13.573
Put your hands where I can see them.

50:13.823 --> 50:15.992
Put your hands where I can see them.

50:16.868 --> 50:18.245
I tell you what to do.

50:18.370 --> 50:20.080
I tell you how to do it.

50:20.914 --> 50:24.334
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

50:26.002 --> 50:28.421
take the package and throw it in here.

50:46.314 --> 50:47.440
Behind you.

50:47.566 --> 50:48.775
<i>On the right.</i>

52:08.113 --> 52:09.532
Roger Van Zant.

52:10.157 --> 52:11.283
Who's this?

52:11.784 --> 52:13.244
You know who this is.

52:14.161 --> 52:15.454
Yes, I do.

52:15.996 --> 52:17.957
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

52:18.082 --> 52:20.251
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

52:21.085 --> 52:23.295
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

52:23.879 --> 52:24.922
What?

52:25.673 --> 52:27.299
Forget the money.

52:29.844 --> 52:33.898
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

52:34.023 --> 52:36.901
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

52:37.819 --> 52:39.237
I don't understand.

52:39.821 --> 52:42.991
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

53:04.220 --> 53:05.471
Do you like it?

53:05.597 --> 53:06.973
Look at my ring.

53:12.395 --> 53:13.605
Did you know?

53:15.148 --> 53:16.649
You are insane.

53:21.905 --> 53:23.031
Do you like it?

53:23.156 --> 53:25.116
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

53:25.283 --> 53:27.202
Don't ask him where he got it.

53:36.002 --> 53:38.338
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

53:38.713 --> 53:39.881
I don't know.

53:42.967 --> 53:44.344
Just like me.

53:44.469 --> 53:45.970
I don't know either.

54:00.568 --> 54:01.611
Hello?

54:02.320 --> 54:03.530
It's me.

54:05.281 --> 54:07.325
I was wondering if you'd call.

54:08.993 --> 54:10.286
I've been busy.

54:10.620 --> 54:11.913
Can I see you?

54:12.372 --> 54:14.258
I was afraid that was just...

54:15.217 --> 54:16.760
the one night.

54:17.928 --> 54:19.763
Not for me, it wasn't.

54:22.307 --> 54:23.767
Yeah, me neither.

54:25.978 --> 54:27.437
Can I fall by?

54:28.814 --> 54:29.898
Yeah.

54:30.148 --> 54:32.025
I'll see you in a little bit.

54:47.165 --> 54:48.834
Goddamn convention.

54:50.127 --> 54:52.296
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

54:52.629 --> 54:54.298
We got two transmitters.

54:54.590 --> 54:57.342
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

54:57.467 --> 54:58.510
Here we are.

54:58.635 --> 55:00.596
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

55:01.346 --> 55:03.307
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

55:03.432 --> 55:06.935
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

55:09.479 --> 55:12.608
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

55:12.733 --> 55:15.027
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

55:16.028 --> 55:18.614
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.

55:18.739 --> 55:20.073
Who's the loner?

55:23.285 --> 55:24.745
First time we've seen him.

55:24.870 --> 55:26.413
We're not on him yet.

55:28.582 --> 55:29.875
Get on it.

55:47.726 --> 55:52.397
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

55:54.367 --> 55:57.495
they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

56:13.261 --> 56:14.887
Baby, time to go.

56:16.514 --> 56:18.891
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

56:22.436 --> 56:23.563
You fly.

56:23.771 --> 56:25.022
You're cool.

56:32.655 --> 56:36.367
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

56:37.285 --> 56:38.578
I ain't lying.

56:39.328 --> 56:40.788
You're a hot dog.

56:41.455 --> 56:43.249
A regular rodeo rider.

56:43.958 --> 56:46.961
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

56:51.507 --> 56:54.260
Now, I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

56:54.385 --> 56:56.596
You don't have a truth-telling style.

56:56.804 --> 56:58.598
What are you talking about?

56:58.806 --> 57:00.892
You don't know what this is.

57:07.440 --> 57:09.901
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

57:28.669 --> 57:30.004
Where have you been?

57:31.631 --> 57:33.299
SHU at Pelican Bay.

57:33.677 --> 57:35.393
Folsom, B-wing.

57:36.353 --> 57:37.896
I am a cowboy...

57:38.730 --> 57:40.607
looking for anything heavy.

57:40.732 --> 57:42.817
Billy said to come see you.

57:43.568 --> 57:45.403
That is why I am here.

57:54.412 --> 57:57.082
Why don't you call this guy?

57:58.166 --> 58:00.377
This guy's always putting guys on.

58:04.506 --> 58:05.549
Thank you.

58:20.063 --> 58:21.898
You're perfect for each other.

58:27.743 --> 58:29.620
I knew a guy in grade school.

58:29.996 --> 58:32.290
His name was Raoul... whatever.

58:32.415 --> 58:35.960
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

58:36.252 --> 58:38.296
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

58:38.421 --> 58:41.382
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

58:42.925 --> 58:45.553
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

58:45.678 --> 58:47.305
bestial sort of way.

58:52.018 --> 58:53.102
Woman.

58:59.942 --> 59:01.777
This better be earth-shattering.

59:08.784 --> 59:10.161
This is to Raoul.

59:12.538 --> 59:14.174
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

59:56.508 --> 59:58.301
Here's how we found her.

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:03.473
How old?

01:00:03.598 --> 01:00:06.643
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

01:00:07.477 --> 01:00:08.895
How'd she die?

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.399
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

01:00:15.318 --> 01:00:16.444
Who's that?

01:00:17.028 --> 01:00:18.280
Mother and siblings.

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:20.198
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

01:00:20.323 --> 01:00:23.201
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

01:00:24.369 --> 01:00:25.495
Let's go.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:31.334
Nice.

01:00:32.294 --> 01:00:36.256
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

01:00:36.381 --> 01:00:39.426
so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:41.344
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

01:00:41.469 --> 01:00:42.679
Not yet.

01:00:44.055 --> 01:00:45.515
Get off of me!

01:00:48.476 --> 01:00:49.686
Oh, my God!

01:00:54.074 --> 01:00:55.242
Where is she?

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:57.119
Easy, easy, easy.

01:01:00.414 --> 01:01:01.874
Please, come on.

01:01:04.793 --> 01:01:06.629
It's okay.

01:01:07.922 --> 01:01:09.381
Where is my baby?

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.716
Where is she?

01:01:11.592 --> 01:01:13.761
I need to know what happened.

01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:58.097
I guess the earth shattered.

01:01:58.931 --> 01:02:01.684
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

01:02:03.644 --> 01:02:05.896
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.648
What was it?

01:02:09.775 --> 01:02:11.235
You don't want to know.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.196
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

01:02:14.321 --> 01:02:16.740
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

01:02:17.408 --> 01:02:20.077
You never told me I'd be excluded.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.331
I told you when we hooked up...

01:02:24.456 --> 01:02:26.667
that you'd have to share me...

01:02:26.792 --> 01:02:30.504
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.840
And I bought into that sharing...

01:02:33.173 --> 01:02:34.767
because I love you.

01:02:35.226 --> 01:02:38.938
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:40.273
I don't care.

01:02:41.482 --> 01:02:44.193
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

01:02:44.319 --> 01:02:47.322
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

01:02:47.488 --> 01:02:50.491
What I should do is come home and say:

01:02:50.992 --> 01:02:54.579
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:58.583
"where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:02.170
"because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

01:03:02.295 --> 01:03:05.089
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:10.261
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

01:03:10.511 --> 01:03:11.638
Right?

01:03:14.015 --> 01:03:15.183
Wrong.

01:03:15.308 --> 01:03:16.434
You know why?

01:03:16.559 --> 01:03:18.770
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:21.105
We fuck and you don't speak.

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:23.358
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

01:03:24.025 --> 01:03:25.401
I preserve it...

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:28.947
because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

01:03:29.447 --> 01:03:30.740
Where I gotta be.

01:03:38.122 --> 01:03:39.832
You don't live with me.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:45.046
You live among the remains
of dead people.

01:03:48.537 --> 01:03:50.289
You read the terrain.

01:03:51.623 --> 01:03:54.001
You search for signs of passing...

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.712
for the scent of your prey...

01:03:56.837 --> 01:03:58.797
and then you hunt them down.

01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:03.135
That's the only thing you're committed to.

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:09.224
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:18.159
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:39.430
Let's go, baby.

01:04:42.266 --> 01:04:43.893
I met the manager.

01:04:44.352 --> 01:04:45.812
Is that the boss?

01:04:46.938 --> 01:04:49.857
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

01:04:50.274 --> 01:04:53.694
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:56.364
Can you do that?

01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:01.369
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

01:05:07.542 --> 01:05:09.377
Why're you hanging with me?

01:05:11.254 --> 01:05:13.089
Because I'm proud of you.

01:05:19.053 --> 01:05:20.471
You're proud of me?

01:05:25.476 --> 01:05:27.562
Why the hell are you proud of me?

01:05:29.147 --> 01:05:30.523
Come on home.

01:05:41.409 --> 01:05:43.077
What were you doing there?

01:05:43.327 --> 01:05:44.745
I was skiing.

01:05:44.996 --> 01:05:46.747
I was trying to ski.

01:05:47.582 --> 01:05:50.510
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

01:05:51.344 --> 01:05:53.138
and you meet people.

01:05:53.513 --> 01:05:55.056
You try to have a good time.

01:05:55.182 --> 01:05:56.808
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

01:05:56.933 --> 01:05:58.059
Why not?

01:05:58.435 --> 01:06:00.395
I'm not good at meeting people.

01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:02.189
You met me.

01:06:02.981 --> 01:06:05.442
That happened without my thinking
about it.

01:06:05.942 --> 01:06:07.819
Which is why I probably...

01:06:08.487 --> 01:06:10.530
No, it's because you are fine.

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:17.829
Take off with me for a while.

01:06:19.289 --> 01:06:20.332
Where?

01:06:20.832 --> 01:06:22.167
New Zealand.

01:06:23.502 --> 01:06:24.586
When?

01:06:26.296 --> 01:06:28.840
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:30.842
But my job...

01:06:30.967 --> 01:06:33.094
I got money. You don't need money.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.639
You could set up a studio and work there.

01:06:36.139 --> 01:06:37.265
I don't know.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:38.892
What's there to know?

01:06:39.059 --> 01:06:40.519
Are you married?

01:06:42.145 --> 01:06:43.271
What?

01:06:43.396 --> 01:06:45.440
The last thing I am is married.

01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:48.527
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

01:06:48.735 --> 01:06:50.403
Then, all of a sudden...

01:06:51.363 --> 01:06:53.365
someone like you comes along.

01:06:56.868 --> 01:06:57.994
You don't know me.

01:06:58.119 --> 01:06:59.579
I know enough.

01:07:03.583 --> 01:07:04.960
Come with me.

01:07:14.886 --> 01:07:16.304
What's wrong?

01:07:18.098 --> 01:07:20.892
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

01:07:25.897 --> 01:07:26.898
Yeah.

01:07:30.703 --> 01:07:31.704
Good.

01:07:56.645 --> 01:07:58.022
Hi, sweetie.

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.901
You forget your mom was picking you up?

01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:04.737
No.

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:08.449
So, what's going on?

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:12.036
I felt like being alone.

01:08:14.997 --> 01:08:16.874
Come on, I'll drive you home.

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:14.816
What's happening?

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:17.734
Sir.

01:09:17.861 --> 01:09:20.488
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:23.073
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

01:10:17.795 --> 01:10:19.047
Technique.

01:10:38.608 --> 01:10:40.568
Open Sesame. Right there.

01:11:38.385 --> 01:11:39.761
There he is.

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:43.000
We walk!

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:44.252
I'm there.

01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:45.503
We walk! Now!

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.852
He's heard it.

01:13:10.278 --> 01:13:11.529
Heads up.

01:13:13.239 --> 01:13:15.324
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

01:13:15.449 --> 01:13:17.743
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

01:13:17.994 --> 01:13:18.995
I see.

01:13:22.206 --> 01:13:24.458
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

01:13:24.584 --> 01:13:26.919
Both of them are not carrying anything.

01:13:36.053 --> 01:13:37.680
<i>- Let them go.
- What do you mean?</i>

01:13:37.805 --> 01:13:38.848
<i>We can take them...</i>

01:13:38.973 --> 01:13:40.057
On what?

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.143
They didn't steal anything yet.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:47.106
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

01:13:47.231 --> 01:13:48.441
No fucking way.

01:13:48.566 --> 01:13:51.777
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

01:13:51.903 --> 01:13:55.448
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

01:13:55.573 --> 01:13:58.326
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

01:13:58.451 --> 01:14:01.579
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

01:14:47.509 --> 01:14:48.927
Back to work.

01:14:50.887 --> 01:14:54.516
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

01:14:55.141 --> 01:14:58.103
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.695
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

01:15:00.903 --> 01:15:04.991
Assume they got our phones, our houses,
that they got us right here, right now...

01:15:05.116 --> 01:15:07.577
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

01:15:08.077 --> 01:15:10.121
How will we buy the bank package?

01:15:10.246 --> 01:15:11.747
I'll front that.

01:15:11.914 --> 01:15:13.583
What about Van Zant?

01:15:13.833 --> 01:15:17.837
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

01:15:17.962 --> 01:15:19.380
No, I want my 750.

01:15:20.006 --> 01:15:24.218
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

01:15:24.343 --> 01:15:26.971
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

01:15:27.263 --> 01:15:29.640
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

01:15:29.765 --> 01:15:34.228
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:41.277
The bank is worth the risk.

01:15:41.527 --> 01:15:42.987
I need it, brother.

01:15:44.655 --> 01:15:47.825
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:00.972
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

01:16:01.431 --> 01:16:03.225
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:05.310
On this one, you're on your own.

01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:20.325
You figure this is the best thing to do?

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.661
This is the best thing to do?

01:16:22.786 --> 01:16:26.957
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:29.960
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.836
You got T-bonds, real estate.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:34.756
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

01:16:53.692 --> 01:16:54.943
For me...

01:16:55.068 --> 01:16:57.112
the action is the juice.

01:16:57.904 --> 01:16:58.905
I'm in.

01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:05.954
Yeah, sure.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.372
Let's go.

01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:10.000
Fuck them, let's do it.

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.377
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

01:17:29.904 --> 01:17:31.697
Tim, I gotta call you back.

01:17:32.031 --> 01:17:34.366
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

01:17:34.575 --> 01:17:35.868
Who the fuck are you?

01:17:35.993 --> 01:17:37.119
Who am I?

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:40.039
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

01:17:40.164 --> 01:17:43.584
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

01:17:45.044 --> 01:17:48.714
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

01:17:48.839 --> 01:17:51.759
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:57.389
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

01:17:57.514 --> 01:17:59.600
up from North Carolina three years ago...

01:17:59.725 --> 01:18:01.685
or you go to work for us.

01:18:02.186 --> 01:18:03.646
Cut and dried.

01:18:04.104 --> 01:18:05.439
That is it.

01:18:05.773 --> 01:18:06.815
Shit.

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:09.485
Charlene Shiherlis.

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:10.694
Who?

01:18:10.861 --> 01:18:11.904
Who?

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:14.114
What are you, a fucking owl?

01:18:14.281 --> 01:18:18.160
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

01:18:18.619 --> 01:18:20.246
You can't tie me to her.

01:18:20.496 --> 01:18:24.541
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

01:18:26.877 --> 01:18:28.504
Why did I get mixed up with her?

01:18:28.629 --> 01:18:31.715
Because she's got a great ass!

01:18:32.883 --> 01:18:35.553
And you got your head all the way up it.

01:18:36.554 --> 01:18:37.596
Jesus.

01:18:38.305 --> 01:18:39.765
Ferocious, aren't I?

01:18:40.224 --> 01:18:41.976
When I think of asses...

01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:43.561
a woman's ass...

01:18:44.144 --> 01:18:46.021
something comes out of me.

01:18:47.064 --> 01:18:48.065
So?

01:18:48.232 --> 01:18:49.817
So, no big thing.

01:18:50.609 --> 01:18:52.069
All I want...

01:18:52.444 --> 01:18:55.072
is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

01:18:55.322 --> 01:18:57.074
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

01:19:02.079 --> 01:19:04.456
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:07.710
that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

01:19:07.835 --> 01:19:08.877
Right.

01:19:09.086 --> 01:19:11.598
The security systems around here
are a joke.

01:19:16.477 --> 01:19:19.272
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

01:19:20.148 --> 01:19:21.232
No. 2:

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:23.526
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 110.</i>

01:19:23.735 --> 01:19:24.777
Good.

01:19:25.069 --> 01:19:26.112
You got it?

01:19:26.237 --> 01:19:27.614
Good. Let's go.

01:19:50.303 --> 01:19:51.846
They were looking back...

01:19:53.348 --> 01:19:54.849
in this direction.

01:19:55.683 --> 01:19:57.393
A container facility?

01:19:57.518 --> 01:19:59.020
What? Cartage theft?

01:19:59.145 --> 01:20:01.856
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

01:20:06.027 --> 01:20:08.238
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

01:20:08.363 --> 01:20:09.697
Refinery only pays by check.

01:20:09.822 --> 01:20:11.074
No cash around.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:12.951
Same for the scrap yard.

01:20:16.496 --> 01:20:17.789
Stealing hubcaps?

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:24.295
A refinery and a scrap yard.

01:20:25.546 --> 01:20:27.382
What the hell is going on?

01:20:27.507 --> 01:20:29.592
That's what we are trying to figure out.

01:20:30.176 --> 01:20:31.928
We thought we had it.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.013
Thought we had it.

01:20:43.731 --> 01:20:45.275
I got an idea...

01:20:46.234 --> 01:20:48.152
on what they were looking at.

01:20:51.873 --> 01:20:54.084
Want to know what they're looking at?

01:20:55.919 --> 01:20:58.797
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

01:21:00.257 --> 01:21:02.259
This crew is good.

01:21:04.511 --> 01:21:06.138
Know what they're looking at?

01:21:07.097 --> 01:21:08.140
What?

01:21:09.558 --> 01:21:10.559
Us.

01:21:12.019 --> 01:21:13.520
The LAPD.

01:21:14.104 --> 01:21:15.939
The police department.

01:21:17.316 --> 01:21:18.775
We just got made.

01:21:26.909 --> 01:21:27.951
Yeah!

01:21:36.543 --> 01:21:37.586
Okay!

01:21:47.346 --> 01:21:49.222
Okay, motherfucker!

01:22:09.701 --> 01:22:11.161
Kelso come through?

01:22:11.536 --> 01:22:13.997
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

01:22:20.045 --> 01:22:21.463
Name is Hanna.

01:22:21.797 --> 01:22:23.257
First name, Vincent.

01:22:23.882 --> 01:22:25.842
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

01:22:25.968 --> 01:22:27.469
Hanna's all over you.

01:22:28.303 --> 01:22:31.023
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

01:22:31.148 --> 01:22:33.526
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

01:22:33.651 --> 01:22:34.902
He's a hot dog.

01:22:35.194 --> 01:22:37.446
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

01:22:38.072 --> 01:22:39.865
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:43.536
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

01:22:43.661 --> 01:22:45.288
He was a fucking maniac.

01:22:46.163 --> 01:22:48.374
He was working Narcotics before that.

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:51.252
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

01:22:51.377 --> 01:22:53.004
He's why the extra heat.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.466
The vice sergeant...

01:22:58.843 --> 01:23:00.720
says Hanna likes you...

01:23:01.721 --> 01:23:05.141
thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

01:23:05.266 --> 01:23:07.727
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

01:23:10.187 --> 01:23:11.647
Funny as a heart attack.

01:23:11.772 --> 01:23:15.276
Three marriages? Do you think
that means he likes staying home?

01:23:16.027 --> 01:23:18.446
Means he's one of those guys out there...

01:23:18.696 --> 01:23:21.365
prowling around all night, dedicated.

01:23:23.743 --> 01:23:26.162
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

01:23:33.502 --> 01:23:35.087
It's worth the stretch.

01:23:36.088 --> 01:23:38.049
This guy can hit or miss.

01:23:38.549 --> 01:23:40.176
You can't miss once.

01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:42.136
You sure?

01:23:43.304 --> 01:23:44.597
I am sure.

01:23:50.728 --> 01:23:52.188
Let's go to the garage.

01:24:20.558 --> 01:24:21.977
Where are we going?

01:24:27.315 --> 01:24:28.775
Where are you going?

01:24:29.150 --> 01:24:30.151
Out.

01:25:28.877 --> 01:25:29.878
What are they on?

01:25:30.003 --> 01:25:31.212
<i>TAC 9.</i>

01:25:33.131 --> 01:25:37.052
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.</i>

01:25:55.788 --> 01:25:58.499
<i>This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?</i>

01:25:58.916 --> 01:26:01.126
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

01:26:01.251 --> 01:26:04.421
<i>Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

01:26:04.546 --> 01:26:06.382
<i>approaching the 110.</i>

01:26:07.591 --> 01:26:09.051
Revolving tail?

01:26:09.218 --> 01:26:11.929
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

01:26:12.054 --> 01:26:15.266
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

01:26:16.308 --> 01:26:17.559
Let's go.

01:27:07.651 --> 01:27:11.614
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.782
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

01:28:20.984 --> 01:28:22.277
How're you doing?

01:28:25.989 --> 01:28:28.616
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

01:28:35.164 --> 01:28:36.457
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:38.418
Follow me.

01:28:54.267 --> 01:28:56.060
Seven years in Folsom.

01:28:56.853 --> 01:28:58.646
In the hole for three.

01:28:58.813 --> 01:29:00.231
McNeil before that.

01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:05.570
McNeil as tough as they say?

01:29:06.821 --> 01:29:08.781
You looking to become a penologist?

01:29:10.042 --> 01:29:11.668
You looking to go back?

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.131
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

01:29:16.256 --> 01:29:17.341
That you?

01:29:18.467 --> 01:29:20.761
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:23.221
I worked all kinds.

01:29:26.892 --> 01:29:30.812
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

01:29:32.105 --> 01:29:33.190
I do not.

01:29:33.398 --> 01:29:34.441
Right.

01:29:35.984 --> 01:29:37.778
I am never going back.

01:29:39.571 --> 01:29:41.657
Then don't take down scores.

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.576
I do what I do best:

01:29:44.785 --> 01:29:48.705
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

01:29:52.626 --> 01:29:54.836
You never wanted a regular-type life?

01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:58.298
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

01:30:00.258 --> 01:30:01.301
Yeah.

01:30:03.804 --> 01:30:05.847
This regular-type life like your life?

01:30:06.515 --> 01:30:08.475
My life? No, my life...

01:30:10.268 --> 01:30:11.937
My life's a disaster zone.

01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:16.316
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:19.945
because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:21.113
I got a wife.

01:30:21.238 --> 01:30:24.074
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

01:30:24.199 --> 01:30:25.242
My third.

01:30:27.452 --> 01:30:31.164
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:32.582
That's my life.

01:30:39.089 --> 01:30:40.841
A guy told me one time:

01:30:42.676 --> 01:30:47.055
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.601
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:54.280
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

01:30:54.697 --> 01:30:57.700
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

01:30:59.577 --> 01:31:01.370
That's an interesting point.

01:31:02.955 --> 01:31:04.206
Are you a monk?

01:31:05.541 --> 01:31:06.751
I have a woman.

01:31:07.335 --> 01:31:08.794
What do you tell her?

01:31:11.255 --> 01:31:12.923
I tell her I'm a salesman.

01:31:19.764 --> 01:31:22.767
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

01:31:23.809 --> 01:31:25.686
you'll just walk out on her?

01:31:27.271 --> 01:31:28.856
Not say good-bye?

01:31:29.649 --> 01:31:31.275
That's the discipline.

01:31:32.151 --> 01:31:33.944
That's pretty vacant.

01:31:34.153 --> 01:31:35.780
It is what it is.

01:31:35.905 --> 01:31:38.658
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

01:31:40.707 --> 01:31:42.668
I don't know how to do anything else.

01:31:43.168 --> 01:31:44.586
Neither do I.

01:31:47.422 --> 01:31:48.966
I don't want to either.

01:31:49.758 --> 01:31:50.926
Neither do I.

01:31:58.642 --> 01:32:01.228
You know, I have this recurring dream.

01:32:03.146 --> 01:32:06.066
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

01:32:06.191 --> 01:32:09.736
all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

01:32:09.861 --> 01:32:13.782
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

01:32:14.449 --> 01:32:18.370
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

01:32:19.663 --> 01:32:22.791
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

01:32:23.208 --> 01:32:26.586
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

01:32:27.379 --> 01:32:29.846
The neighbors reported the smell...

01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:32.435
and there they are...

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.270
all just sitting there.

01:32:36.522 --> 01:32:37.690
What do they say?

01:32:39.734 --> 01:32:40.735
Nothing.

01:32:41.193 --> 01:32:42.361
No talk?

01:32:44.572 --> 01:32:46.324
They have nothing to say.

01:32:47.241 --> 01:32:49.201
We just look at each other.

01:32:50.202 --> 01:32:51.829
They look at me...

01:32:52.371 --> 01:32:54.498
and that's it. That's the dream.

01:32:57.376 --> 01:32:59.211
I have one where I'm drowning.

01:33:00.004 --> 01:33:03.633
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.094
Know what that's about?

01:33:08.763 --> 01:33:10.181
Having enough time.

01:33:11.891 --> 01:33:13.059
Enough time...

01:33:13.517 --> 01:33:15.227
to do what you want to do?

01:33:15.436 --> 01:33:16.687
That's right.

01:33:19.231 --> 01:33:20.566
You doing it now?

01:33:20.775 --> 01:33:21.984
No, not yet.

01:33:27.615 --> 01:33:29.575
You know, we're sitting here...

01:33:30.951 --> 01:33:33.162
like a couple of regular fellas.

01:33:33.287 --> 01:33:36.123
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:40.586
Now that we've been face to face...

01:33:43.589 --> 01:33:46.217
if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

01:33:46.592 --> 01:33:48.052
I won't like it.

01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:50.054
But, I tell you...

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.600
if it's between you...

01:33:54.809 --> 01:33:58.604
and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

01:33:59.605 --> 01:34:00.773
brother...

01:34:01.273 --> 01:34:03.109
you are going down.

01:34:15.672 --> 01:34:17.966
There's a flip side to that coin.

01:34:20.301 --> 01:34:22.470
What if you do got me boxed in...

01:34:22.929 --> 01:34:24.681
and I gotta put you down?

01:34:25.849 --> 01:34:27.559
Because no matter what...

01:34:28.059 --> 01:34:30.020
you won't get in my way.

01:34:31.354 --> 01:34:33.565
We've been face to face, yeah.

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.570
But I will not hesitate.

01:34:38.903 --> 01:34:40.238
Not for a second.

01:34:46.786 --> 01:34:48.246
Maybe that'll happen.

01:34:50.999 --> 01:34:52.000
Or...

01:34:52.375 --> 01:34:53.668
who knows?

01:34:54.294 --> 01:34:56.629
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

01:35:12.538 --> 01:35:14.039
They dumped us.

01:35:15.332 --> 01:35:16.375
What?

01:35:16.833 --> 01:35:18.293
They dumped us.

01:35:18.919 --> 01:35:20.128
What do you mean?

01:35:20.254 --> 01:35:21.505
Chris slipped away.

01:35:21.630 --> 01:35:23.507
He doesn't talk about their scores...

01:35:23.632 --> 01:35:26.968
so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

01:35:27.343 --> 01:35:29.303
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

01:35:29.428 --> 01:35:32.056
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

01:35:34.767 --> 01:35:36.519
They dumped all our surveillance?

01:35:36.644 --> 01:35:38.854
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

01:35:40.147 --> 01:35:43.359
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

01:35:43.484 --> 01:35:44.527
We were on you.

01:35:44.652 --> 01:35:48.531
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

01:35:49.282 --> 01:35:51.668
His car's still there. He's gone.

01:35:57.132 --> 01:36:01.636
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

01:37:01.487 --> 01:37:02.529
Hear from him?

01:37:03.447 --> 01:37:07.409
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:10.955
This guy...

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.540
we put him on.

01:37:12.665 --> 01:37:14.291
Says he knows McCauley.

01:37:20.047 --> 01:37:21.048
Who are you?

01:37:22.258 --> 01:37:23.425
Waingro.

01:37:24.009 --> 01:37:25.636
My name's Waingro.

01:37:26.011 --> 01:37:29.181
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

01:37:30.608 --> 01:37:33.068
We took some major scores together.

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:38.907
Why haven't I heard from him?

01:37:39.032 --> 01:37:40.909
He's probably busy right now.

01:37:41.535 --> 01:37:43.161
But he's real thorough.

01:37:44.538 --> 01:37:46.665
He ain't going to forget about you.

01:37:46.999 --> 01:37:48.375
That's reassuring.

01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:52.671
I got some moves I could make here.

01:37:53.797 --> 01:37:56.008
Probably be a big help to you.

01:38:17.570 --> 01:38:19.196
You recognize the grill man?

01:38:26.662 --> 01:38:27.705
No.

01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:28.873
Folsom.

01:38:28.998 --> 01:38:31.334
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

01:38:33.002 --> 01:38:34.462
I ain't got my break yet.

01:38:34.587 --> 01:38:36.756
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

01:38:37.006 --> 01:38:39.633
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

01:38:39.966 --> 01:38:41.676
Take your break later.

01:38:42.052 --> 01:38:43.470
Piece of shit.

01:38:43.887 --> 01:38:45.013
Pick up!

01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:49.768
Where the hell is he?

01:38:49.893 --> 01:38:52.103
I want to check the slot for the work car.

01:38:52.312 --> 01:38:53.396
So did I.

01:39:01.363 --> 01:39:02.405
Hang on.

01:39:05.408 --> 01:39:10.172
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

01:39:21.976 --> 01:39:23.143
Where are you?

01:39:23.269 --> 01:39:25.980
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

01:39:26.981 --> 01:39:28.315
I can't dump them.

01:39:31.068 --> 01:39:32.861
They know you see them?

01:39:33.153 --> 01:39:35.030
They're doing parallels.

01:39:37.741 --> 01:39:39.285
I can try to dump them again.

01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:41.370
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

01:39:41.495 --> 01:39:43.121
If not, you'll draw them to us.

01:39:43.705 --> 01:39:44.789
Go to Ventura.

01:39:44.914 --> 01:39:46.165
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

01:39:46.291 --> 01:39:49.752
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

01:40:16.362 --> 01:40:17.405
Pick up.

01:40:19.908 --> 01:40:21.409
Neil, man. What's up?

01:40:21.618 --> 01:40:22.660
What's up?

01:40:22.785 --> 01:40:24.495
What are you doing here?

01:40:24.787 --> 01:40:28.249
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

01:40:28.374 --> 01:40:29.667
Right now, today.

01:40:30.043 --> 01:40:31.336
You remember the drill?

01:40:31.461 --> 01:40:32.712
Yeah, sure.

01:40:32.921 --> 01:40:34.047
You cool?

01:40:34.797 --> 01:40:36.424
You know I'm cool.

01:40:37.217 --> 01:40:39.594
One answer: Yes or no. Right now.

01:40:53.824 --> 01:40:56.619
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

01:40:57.995 --> 01:40:59.538
Out back in five.

01:41:10.007 --> 01:41:11.384
What's burning?

01:41:11.926 --> 01:41:13.135
What is this?

01:41:13.636 --> 01:41:15.638
Where do you think you're going?

01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:53.993
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:55.202
Hands up!

01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.995
Put them up! Now!

01:42:58.372 --> 01:42:59.456
Get on your knees!

01:42:59.623 --> 01:43:00.624
The keys!

01:43:01.625 --> 01:43:03.085
Get on your knees!

01:43:07.464 --> 01:43:08.590
Get over there!

01:43:10.008 --> 01:43:11.093
Turn around!

01:43:11.301 --> 01:43:12.844
Put your hands behind you!

01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:14.012
Get down!

01:43:14.137 --> 01:43:15.180
Stay down!

01:43:16.223 --> 01:43:17.224
Get down!

01:43:20.018 --> 01:43:22.437
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

01:43:27.317 --> 01:43:28.360
Stay down!

01:43:29.152 --> 01:43:32.155
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

01:43:32.281 --> 01:43:35.284
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:36.577
Think of your families.

01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:39.162
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

01:43:39.538 --> 01:43:44.251
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

01:43:44.376 --> 01:43:46.920
anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

01:43:48.338 --> 01:43:49.339
The key.

01:43:49.548 --> 01:43:50.799
What key?

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:54.803
Sit down and stay down!

01:43:55.846 --> 01:43:58.473
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

01:44:47.781 --> 01:44:49.741
Get down. Down, down, down.

01:44:49.991 --> 01:44:51.451
Put your heads down!

01:45:17.017 --> 01:45:19.353
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

01:45:19.478 --> 01:45:22.690
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

01:45:25.859 --> 01:45:28.821
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

01:45:46.297 --> 01:45:48.591
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

01:45:48.716 --> 01:45:51.769
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

01:46:30.014 --> 01:46:31.766
They're already coming out.

01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:34.393
We gotta take them in the car.

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.354
Wait till they are all in.

01:46:36.604 --> 01:46:38.898
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

01:46:48.449 --> 01:46:49.825
Police! Move!

01:46:51.285 --> 01:46:52.662
Move. Move. Get down.

01:47:14.808 --> 01:47:16.142
Move it. Down, down.

01:47:19.646 --> 01:47:20.814
We did it!

01:47:25.318 --> 01:47:26.361
Move!

01:47:32.668 --> 01:47:33.877
Get down!

01:47:43.429 --> 01:47:44.471
Get in the car!

01:48:01.238 --> 01:48:02.448
Go! Go!

01:49:03.347 --> 01:49:04.390
Go!

01:49:29.298 --> 01:49:30.299
Go!

01:51:11.407 --> 01:51:12.408
Come on!

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:46.733
Get down!

01:51:59.871 --> 01:52:03.791
All the way down! Get down! Now!

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:05.236
Come here.

01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:52.073
I got you.

01:53:56.411 --> 01:54:00.790
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

01:54:01.166 --> 01:54:04.169
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.</i>

01:54:04.419 --> 01:54:08.381
<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:12.311
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers...</i>

01:54:12.436 --> 01:54:13.854
Excuse me, bartender.

01:54:14.063 --> 01:54:17.900
<i>Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

01:54:18.025 --> 01:54:21.152
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...</i>

01:54:21.361 --> 01:54:23.780
<i>that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

01:54:24.072 --> 01:54:25.490
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

01:54:25.615 --> 01:54:29.661
<i>one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

01:54:29.786 --> 01:54:31.037
<i>Also fatally wounded:</i>

01:54:31.162 --> 01:54:34.457
<i>Another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...</i>

01:54:34.582 --> 01:54:38.169
<i>during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.</i>

01:54:40.296 --> 01:54:41.756
All right, hold him.

01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:43.590
It's all right.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.683
So?

01:54:52.808 --> 01:54:54.810
He's got blood loss and shock.

01:54:54.935 --> 01:54:58.689
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

01:54:59.564 --> 01:55:00.691
Bottom line?

01:55:01.233 --> 01:55:03.944
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

01:55:04.403 --> 01:55:06.780
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

01:55:07.489 --> 01:55:08.573
Six, seven hours.

01:55:08.699 --> 01:55:10.242
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:55:10.659 --> 01:55:12.119
Take off your shirt.

01:55:12.244 --> 01:55:13.245
What?

01:55:14.746 --> 01:55:16.206
Take off your shirt.

01:55:24.715 --> 01:55:26.091
My daughter gave it to me.

01:55:26.216 --> 01:55:28.385
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

01:55:40.772 --> 01:55:41.940
Listen to me.

01:55:42.357 --> 01:55:46.320
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

01:55:47.695 --> 01:55:48.779
Where's Charlene?

01:55:48.904 --> 01:55:53.293
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

01:55:53.418 --> 01:55:55.420
I'm not going without her.

01:55:55.795 --> 01:55:57.088
Think about that.

01:55:57.422 --> 01:55:59.215
I will meet you at Nate's.

01:55:59.466 --> 01:56:00.759
Where are you going?

01:56:00.925 --> 01:56:04.679
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:06.431
Who did it?

01:56:07.807 --> 01:56:09.100
Who wasn't there?

01:56:10.602 --> 01:56:11.603
Trejo.

01:56:15.482 --> 01:56:17.025
See you at Nate's.

01:56:25.367 --> 01:56:26.743
You still want me?

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:30.288
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

01:56:31.539 --> 01:56:32.666
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

01:56:33.124 --> 01:56:35.085
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

01:56:36.419 --> 01:56:37.462
All right.

01:56:39.506 --> 01:56:41.299
Goddamn you, Chris.

01:56:41.424 --> 01:56:42.550
Goddamn you.

01:56:43.551 --> 01:56:45.762
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

01:56:46.012 --> 01:56:47.055
Right.

01:57:35.403 --> 01:57:37.530
Why did you do it? What happened?

01:57:38.906 --> 01:57:40.450
- They made me.
- Who?

01:57:40.616 --> 01:57:41.826
Where's Anna?

01:57:43.244 --> 01:57:44.370
She's dead.

01:57:47.332 --> 01:57:50.418
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:52.086
Who did it?

01:57:52.253 --> 01:57:53.254
Who did it?

01:57:53.379 --> 01:57:55.089
They had Anna, man.

01:57:55.256 --> 01:57:56.257
Who?

01:57:57.674 --> 01:57:58.800
Waingro.

01:57:59.593 --> 01:58:00.802
Waingro.

01:58:01.595 --> 01:58:02.721
On his own?

01:58:04.765 --> 01:58:06.475
- For someone.
- Who?

01:58:07.768 --> 01:58:10.062
The other he worked for.

01:58:11.271 --> 01:58:12.481
Van Zant.

01:58:15.484 --> 01:58:16.777
Van Zant?

01:58:21.072 --> 01:58:22.239
Are you sure?

01:58:22.823 --> 01:58:24.075
Van Zant.

01:58:25.868 --> 01:58:28.204
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:30.790
I don't think so.

01:58:31.499 --> 01:58:32.667
Come on.

01:58:34.543 --> 01:58:36.087
I don't remember.

01:58:41.509 --> 01:58:42.635
I'll call a medic.

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:44.595
I'm not going to make it.

01:58:46.889 --> 01:58:48.975
I can't feel nothing.

01:58:51.227 --> 01:58:53.104
My Anna's gone.

01:58:55.314 --> 01:58:56.941
She's gone.

01:58:58.985 --> 01:59:00.944
Don't leave me like this.

01:59:01.987 --> 01:59:03.488
Please, homes.

01:59:04.614 --> 01:59:06.574
Don't leave me like this.

01:59:33.527 --> 01:59:35.988
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

01:59:36.905 --> 01:59:38.157
It's a new one.

01:59:39.616 --> 01:59:42.077
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

01:59:42.453 --> 01:59:43.829
10725.

01:59:44.204 --> 01:59:45.581
<i>10725.</i>

01:59:45.914 --> 01:59:46.999
<i>Chris?</i>

01:59:47.499 --> 01:59:49.209
He's with me, my place.

01:59:49.543 --> 01:59:51.879
Next, Waingro, okay?

01:59:53.714 --> 01:59:55.007
You got the time?

01:59:56.008 --> 01:59:57.384
I'll make time.

01:59:57.760 --> 01:59:59.511
And I need a new out.

02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:01.347
Is it blown?

02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.767
How can I trust it?

02:00:07.894 --> 02:00:09.020
You got it.

02:00:10.063 --> 02:00:11.522
Stay healthy.

02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:18.696
Charlene Shiherlis.

02:00:19.614 --> 02:00:22.533
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

02:00:22.659 --> 02:00:24.160
Neil's transportation.

02:00:24.285 --> 02:00:28.122
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

02:00:28.581 --> 02:00:30.958
You don't believe he already had a plan?

02:00:31.084 --> 02:00:32.669
Sure. Now he needs another.

02:00:32.794 --> 02:00:34.921
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:39.050
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

02:00:39.175 --> 02:00:42.720
He's a C.I. For a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

02:00:42.929 --> 02:00:44.514
On Neil McCauley.

02:00:44.722 --> 02:00:46.182
How much time we got?

02:00:46.641 --> 02:00:51.279
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

02:01:44.999 --> 02:01:47.752
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

02:01:48.002 --> 02:01:49.295
Who told you?

02:01:49.670 --> 02:01:51.964
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:53.382
Who?

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:39.519
Waingro, where is he?

02:02:40.561 --> 02:02:41.688
Where?

02:02:41.813 --> 02:02:43.106
How would I know?

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:09.882
Well...

02:03:10.466 --> 02:03:12.218
what do we have here?

02:03:13.177 --> 02:03:14.345
This pretty?

02:03:14.470 --> 02:03:15.555
This pretty?

02:03:19.182 --> 02:03:20.642
You piece of shit.

02:03:20.767 --> 02:03:23.770
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

02:03:23.895 --> 02:03:25.647
You want out? This is out.

02:03:25.772 --> 02:03:28.984
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

02:03:29.568 --> 02:03:30.944
How'd I get into this?

02:03:31.069 --> 02:03:32.112
Easy.

02:03:32.904 --> 02:03:35.240
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

02:03:35.615 --> 02:03:36.742
Fix her a drink.

02:03:36.867 --> 02:03:38.702
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

02:03:38.827 --> 02:03:39.870
Fuck her.

02:03:42.289 --> 02:03:44.916
You better get in there and stay in there.

02:03:48.503 --> 02:03:49.880
Lookie here.

02:03:51.423 --> 02:03:54.134
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

02:03:54.259 --> 02:03:56.053
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

02:03:56.178 --> 02:03:57.929
He stays with me.

02:04:08.065 --> 02:04:09.442
So, what now?

02:04:12.286 --> 02:04:13.371
He's right.

02:04:13.496 --> 02:04:15.498
You want out? This is out.

02:04:17.375 --> 02:04:19.585
You believe you have to betray Chris?

02:04:19.710 --> 02:04:20.920
No shit.

02:04:21.504 --> 02:04:23.880
That's right. You would have to.

02:04:24.506 --> 02:04:28.343
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

02:04:29.344 --> 02:04:32.806
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

02:04:32.931 --> 02:04:37.644
'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

02:04:37.769 --> 02:04:39.646
juvenile facilities.

02:04:39.896 --> 02:04:41.648
Then he steals a car.

02:04:42.357 --> 02:04:47.237
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

02:04:47.862 --> 02:04:50.115
Fucked for life.

02:04:51.324 --> 02:04:53.994
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

02:04:55.662 --> 02:04:59.960
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

02:05:01.966 --> 02:05:04.677
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

02:05:05.678 --> 02:05:07.013
You can do it...

02:05:07.388 --> 02:05:09.640
for your kid, so you can raise him.

02:05:13.686 --> 02:05:15.021
What else are you selling?

02:05:15.146 --> 02:05:16.522
All kinds of shit.

02:05:18.024 --> 02:05:22.820
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

02:05:29.576 --> 02:05:31.119
<i>Here's an update.</i>

02:05:31.244 --> 02:05:32.787
Drucker's on Line 2.

02:05:32.912 --> 02:05:34.414
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

02:05:37.292 --> 02:05:39.210
Drucker's on the other line.

02:05:39.878 --> 02:05:41.087
Conference him in.

02:05:42.339 --> 02:05:43.381
Go ahead.

02:05:43.757 --> 02:05:45.383
Vincent, it's me.

02:05:48.094 --> 02:05:50.230
One answer. What's it going to be?

02:05:57.237 --> 02:05:59.740
We're set here. She'll make the call.

02:05:59.865 --> 02:06:02.951
That's good. Here's the deal.

02:06:03.369 --> 02:06:06.497
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

02:06:06.622 --> 02:06:09.083
and become a born-again good citizen.

02:06:09.416 --> 02:06:13.629
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

02:06:14.046 --> 02:06:18.842
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

02:06:18.967 --> 02:06:20.219
<i>Van Zant.</i>

02:06:20.928 --> 02:06:23.930
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

02:06:24.055 --> 02:06:26.182
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

02:06:26.766 --> 02:06:30.019
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.</i>

02:06:30.269 --> 02:06:33.772
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

02:06:33.897 --> 02:06:35.774
under the name Jamieson.

02:06:36.024 --> 02:06:40.570
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

02:06:40.696 --> 02:06:43.657
<i>assignment officers
and snitches in County.</i>

02:06:43.782 --> 02:06:48.120
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

02:06:48.245 --> 02:06:50.706
<i>and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.</i>

02:06:50.831 --> 02:06:53.208
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:54.793
How're you feeling?

02:06:55.585 --> 02:06:57.129
Banged up, but I'll live.

02:07:06.346 --> 02:07:07.681
He's here.

02:07:08.432 --> 02:07:10.058
Neil is still here.

02:07:11.268 --> 02:07:12.728
I can feel it.

02:07:13.603 --> 02:07:15.022
For how long?

02:07:16.565 --> 02:07:18.483
Seven, eight hours, max.

02:07:27.909 --> 02:07:29.202
What did you do?

02:07:29.792 --> 02:07:30.838
That was you?

02:07:31.213 --> 02:07:33.090
I don't sell metal.

02:07:33.799 --> 02:07:36.843
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

02:07:36.968 --> 02:07:38.511
We gotta go together.

02:07:39.012 --> 02:07:41.348
Those other people were with you?

02:07:42.891 --> 02:07:44.476
My friend, Michael...

02:07:46.227 --> 02:07:48.146
he knew the risks.

02:07:52.692 --> 02:07:54.694
When it rains, you get wet.

02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:59.074
Get packed. Let's go.

02:08:18.551 --> 02:08:20.470
Why did you do this to me?

02:08:32.065 --> 02:08:33.400
It'll be all right.

02:08:33.525 --> 02:08:35.443
Do you understand?

02:08:40.115 --> 02:08:41.865
It's going to be all right.

02:08:53.335 --> 02:08:56.463
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:03.220
Here's some cash.

02:09:06.223 --> 02:09:07.474
When is it over?

02:09:10.945 --> 02:09:12.613
Twenty-two hours from now.

02:09:12.989 --> 02:09:16.951
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

02:09:20.580 --> 02:09:21.581
Go now.

02:09:21.706 --> 02:09:23.666
You want out? There's the door.

02:09:24.292 --> 02:09:26.252
Will you let me leave later?

02:09:31.424 --> 02:09:32.967
It will be different.

02:09:34.635 --> 02:09:36.346
Do you even understand?

02:10:07.334 --> 02:10:08.668
It's ready.

02:10:16.385 --> 02:10:18.178
This is my friend Ralph.

02:10:18.845 --> 02:10:20.806
You didn't tell me you were...

02:10:21.682 --> 02:10:23.016
Oh, my God!

02:10:23.225 --> 02:10:24.434
Where's Lauren?

02:10:24.810 --> 02:10:26.560
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

02:10:27.061 --> 02:10:29.188
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

02:10:29.313 --> 02:10:30.398
What for?

02:10:30.523 --> 02:10:31.649
Sit down.

02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:34.026
Don't you get angry?

02:10:34.902 --> 02:10:35.986
I'm angry.

02:10:37.738 --> 02:10:39.573
I'm very angry, Ralph.

02:10:40.324 --> 02:10:43.244
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

02:10:44.829 --> 02:10:48.207
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

02:10:49.332 --> 02:10:51.176
In her ex-husband's...

02:10:51.719 --> 02:10:54.930
dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

02:10:55.055 --> 02:10:56.432
if you want to.

02:10:59.143 --> 02:11:01.353
But you do not get to watch...

02:11:01.687 --> 02:11:03.522
my fucking...

02:11:03.647 --> 02:11:04.815
television set!

02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.275
For God's sake.

02:11:13.157 --> 02:11:14.950
Put the television set down.

02:11:15.117 --> 02:11:17.661
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

02:11:17.786 --> 02:11:19.872
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

02:11:20.039 --> 02:11:23.208
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

02:11:23.333 --> 02:11:24.960
Our situation is absurd.

02:11:27.588 --> 02:11:30.382
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

02:11:33.302 --> 02:11:37.139
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

02:11:37.347 --> 02:11:39.933
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

02:11:40.059 --> 02:11:41.268
How admirable.

02:11:41.393 --> 02:11:43.645
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

02:11:44.313 --> 02:11:45.314
No.

02:11:46.774 --> 02:11:49.735
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

02:11:50.569 --> 02:11:52.654
you walk through our life dead.

02:11:53.405 --> 02:11:57.450
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

02:12:10.505 --> 02:12:12.882
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

02:12:13.424 --> 02:12:14.634
The plane...

02:12:15.093 --> 02:12:18.554
charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

02:12:18.679 --> 02:12:20.306
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

02:12:23.559 --> 02:12:24.727
Touches down...

02:12:24.852 --> 02:12:27.355
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

02:12:27.605 --> 02:12:31.159
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

02:12:33.036 --> 02:12:34.121
Where's Chris?

02:12:34.454 --> 02:12:35.497
He's gone.

02:12:36.873 --> 02:12:37.874
What?

02:12:38.542 --> 02:12:41.044
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

02:12:41.169 --> 02:12:43.422
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

02:12:44.297 --> 02:12:45.340
What happened?

02:12:46.466 --> 02:12:48.009
It's a free country.

02:12:53.265 --> 02:12:55.058
Check in with me at 9:00...

02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:57.102
everything is still cool.

02:12:58.978 --> 02:13:00.104
All right.

02:13:23.294 --> 02:13:25.755
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

02:13:29.091 --> 02:13:30.885
I know life is short.

02:13:31.552 --> 02:13:33.596
Whatever time you get is luck.

02:13:36.348 --> 02:13:37.892
You want to walk?

02:13:40.770 --> 02:13:42.521
You walk right now...

02:13:44.148 --> 02:13:45.733
all on your own.

02:13:46.442 --> 02:13:49.070
On your own you choose to come with me.

02:13:55.493 --> 02:13:57.078
All I know is...

02:13:59.372 --> 02:14:02.999
there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

02:14:04.209 --> 02:14:06.169
if it's going to be alone...

02:14:07.253 --> 02:14:08.755
without you.

02:15:08.822 --> 02:15:09.906
I got a live one.

02:15:10.866 --> 02:15:12.242
I'll hold.

02:15:14.703 --> 02:15:16.163
Show yourself.

02:15:17.289 --> 02:15:19.332
- Do it.
- Shut up!

02:15:23.211 --> 02:15:25.422
Now, just one second at the window...

02:15:26.715 --> 02:15:28.467
and it's all over.

02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:19.543
Hey, man...

02:17:21.335 --> 02:17:24.590
you know any place to rent around here?

02:17:27.968 --> 02:17:30.103
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

02:17:42.282 --> 02:17:43.409
It's not him.

02:17:43.534 --> 02:17:44.869
It's not Chris.

02:17:53.044 --> 02:17:54.712
Unit 2, this is Command.

02:17:55.213 --> 02:17:56.589
Take him at the street.

02:17:56.714 --> 02:17:57.882
Check him out.

02:18:25.534 --> 02:18:26.951
He's John Peterson.

02:18:27.076 --> 02:18:29.036
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

02:18:29.161 --> 02:18:31.580
<i>Bukowski, Gene.</i>

02:18:31.914 --> 02:18:33.124
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

02:18:33.249 --> 02:18:34.500
<i>It's clean.</i>

02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:38.629
Let him go.

02:18:39.088 --> 02:18:40.172
Roger.

02:18:40.464 --> 02:18:42.424
Thank you. Have a good evening.

02:18:44.802 --> 02:18:45.886
It's no-go.

02:18:55.688 --> 02:18:58.482
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

02:18:58.607 --> 02:19:00.316
Yeah, that would be nice.

02:19:31.482 --> 02:19:32.816
What do you got?

02:19:32.941 --> 02:19:34.359
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

02:19:47.623 --> 02:19:49.083
Hello, it's Vincent.

02:19:49.708 --> 02:19:50.751
<i>What do you got?</i>

02:19:50.876 --> 02:19:53.295
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:54.755
<i>That's it.</i>

02:20:03.555 --> 02:20:04.848
You know what?

02:20:07.434 --> 02:20:08.852
Neil is gone.

02:20:13.982 --> 02:20:15.526
Flying like a bird.

02:20:16.443 --> 02:20:17.736
How do you know?

02:20:19.321 --> 02:20:20.531
We still got bait!

02:20:20.656 --> 02:20:22.699
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

02:20:22.825 --> 02:20:24.118
What do we got?

02:20:25.035 --> 02:20:26.995
<i>Bon voyage, motherfucker.</i>

02:20:28.497 --> 02:20:29.956
You were good.

02:20:31.791 --> 02:20:33.418
I'm going to the hotel.

02:20:34.710 --> 02:20:36.671
I'm going to take a shower...

02:20:37.714 --> 02:20:40.550
and I'm going to sleep for a month.

02:22:51.452 --> 02:22:52.494
Here.

02:22:59.626 --> 02:23:00.669
Come on.

02:23:09.344 --> 02:23:10.387
Shit.

02:23:19.688 --> 02:23:21.398
Motherfucking waste.

02:23:24.902 --> 02:23:27.863
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

02:23:27.988 --> 02:23:29.031
Not you, baby.

02:23:29.156 --> 02:23:30.365
Not you.

02:23:35.704 --> 02:23:38.665
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

02:23:38.791 --> 02:23:41.585
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

02:23:48.966 --> 02:23:51.052
I need somebody to help...

02:23:57.225 --> 02:23:58.309
I got you.

02:23:59.644 --> 02:24:02.730
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

02:24:03.272 --> 02:24:04.774
Let's get a doctor!

02:24:04.899 --> 02:24:06.609
Let's go! A doctor here!

02:24:06.943 --> 02:24:09.320
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

02:24:09.447 --> 02:24:11.581
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

02:24:14.126 --> 02:24:16.586
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

02:24:17.003 --> 02:24:20.465
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

02:24:20.841 --> 02:24:22.008
Her pressure's down.

02:24:22.134 --> 02:24:24.344
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:25.679
It's ready.

02:24:27.347 --> 02:24:29.349
When's the last time anybody saw her?

02:24:29.474 --> 02:24:30.475
I don't know.

02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:31.935
Where did you find her?

02:24:32.144 --> 02:24:33.270
The bathtub.

02:24:35.272 --> 02:24:37.524
Give her large-bore normal saline.

02:24:37.649 --> 02:24:39.067
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

02:24:39.192 --> 02:24:42.529
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

02:24:44.489 --> 02:24:47.950
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

02:24:48.075 --> 02:24:51.036
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

02:24:57.376 --> 02:25:00.463
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

02:25:00.588 --> 02:25:02.047
Her vital signs are stable.

02:25:02.214 --> 02:25:04.717
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

02:25:04.842 --> 02:25:05.926
She's okay?

02:25:06.051 --> 02:25:07.136
She's doing good.

02:25:07.261 --> 02:25:08.763
She'll be okay.

02:25:09.263 --> 02:25:11.140
She's going to be okay.

02:25:11.348 --> 02:25:14.226
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

02:25:15.686 --> 02:25:18.773
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

02:25:23.194 --> 02:25:25.821
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.365
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

02:25:28.491 --> 02:25:31.243
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

02:25:46.217 --> 02:25:47.301
It's me.

02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:50.522
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

02:25:51.188 --> 02:25:53.065
I still can't find a driver...

02:25:53.232 --> 02:25:54.900
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

02:25:55.317 --> 02:25:56.693
<i>One other thing...</i>

02:25:57.736 --> 02:25:59.613
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

02:26:00.072 --> 02:26:04.159
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

02:26:04.451 --> 02:26:06.203
<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

02:26:06.495 --> 02:26:07.871
You figured right.

02:26:08.330 --> 02:26:09.873
So, so long, brother.

02:26:12.126 --> 02:26:13.585
You take it easy.

02:26:14.294 --> 02:26:15.587
You're home free.

02:26:17.673 --> 02:26:18.882
Take it easy.

02:26:29.935 --> 02:26:31.018
What is it?

02:26:31.352 --> 02:26:32.520
Nothing.

02:26:32.854 --> 02:26:34.063
Home free.

02:27:12.267 --> 02:27:14.144
I gotta take care of something.

02:27:14.311 --> 02:27:15.562
Is there time?

02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:17.439
There's time.

02:27:46.227 --> 02:27:48.854
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

02:28:31.229 --> 02:28:32.230
<i>Registration.</i>

02:28:32.355 --> 02:28:33.440
This is room service.

02:28:33.565 --> 02:28:37.444
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

02:28:37.569 --> 02:28:39.362
<i>- They're always doing that.
- I know.</i>

02:28:39.487 --> 02:28:41.030
<i>1735.</i>

02:28:41.156 --> 02:28:42.365
Thank you.

02:30:26.101 --> 02:30:27.769
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

02:30:27.894 --> 02:30:30.939
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

02:30:31.523 --> 02:30:32.940
<i>Do not panic.</i>

02:30:33.065 --> 02:30:35.067
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

02:30:40.114 --> 02:30:41.532
I'm staying here.

02:30:41.657 --> 02:30:44.952
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

02:30:49.543 --> 02:30:51.843
What about her dad? Should I call him?

02:30:52.927 --> 02:30:55.138
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

02:30:57.223 --> 02:30:58.850
And she chose you.

02:31:01.478 --> 02:31:03.271
She picked your place.

02:31:05.482 --> 02:31:07.358
It's not right, what happened to her.

02:31:07.484 --> 02:31:08.943
No, it's not.

02:31:25.417 --> 02:31:27.127
Is there any way that...

02:31:29.505 --> 02:31:31.548
it could work out between us?

02:31:34.384 --> 02:31:36.720
I wish I could say yes, you know.

02:31:37.095 --> 02:31:38.138
But...

02:31:38.347 --> 02:31:39.890
in the end...

02:31:44.853 --> 02:31:46.563
It's like you said:

02:31:49.733 --> 02:31:51.068
All I am...

02:31:51.777 --> 02:31:53.862
is what I'm going after.

02:32:01.286 --> 02:32:03.455
I'm not what you want, Justine.

02:32:14.591 --> 02:32:16.510
Go on, if you have to.

02:32:19.303 --> 02:32:20.429
I'll stay.

02:32:20.555 --> 02:32:22.598
I'm okay. I can handle this.

02:32:25.643 --> 02:32:27.103
Just be careful.

02:32:27.895 --> 02:32:30.532
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

02:32:31.658 --> 02:32:32.659
Okay?

02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:35.805
Security. There's a fire on three.

02:33:35.930 --> 02:33:37.556
We have to evacuate all floors.

02:33:37.681 --> 02:33:39.308
I can't leave here.

02:33:48.192 --> 02:33:51.195
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

02:34:05.501 --> 02:34:06.794
He's here on 17.

02:34:09.802 --> 02:34:11.015
Look at me.

02:34:11.182 --> 02:34:12.225
Look at me!

02:34:15.603 --> 02:34:16.646
Look at me!

02:34:48.634 --> 02:34:50.011
LAPD! Don't move!

02:34:50.136 --> 02:34:51.929
Put your hands on your head!

02:35:27.507 --> 02:35:29.342
Switch me to TAC 5.

02:35:29.967 --> 02:35:31.176
Casals...

02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:32.552
JJ...

02:35:33.303 --> 02:35:34.596
Drucker, JJ...

02:35:34.721 --> 02:35:37.057
<i>I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

02:35:37.182 --> 02:35:38.266
What have you got?

02:35:38.391 --> 02:35:41.186
<i>Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th floor.</i>

02:35:41.311 --> 02:35:44.731
<i>Elevators are all out of commission
because of the fire alarm.</i>

02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:46.525
Fine. 10-4.

02:38:11.561 --> 02:38:13.104
Let me have that shotgun.

02:44:31.308 --> 02:44:33.435
Told you I'm never going back.

02:44:37.606 --> 02:44:38.648
Yeah.

02:44:39.305 --> 02:44:45.540
