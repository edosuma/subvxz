(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:39.375 --> 00:41.500
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

00:44.583 --> 00:45.583
Morning, Baymax.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.208
Baymax?

00:51.875 --> 00:53.833
Wow, Cass, look at you all up and around.

00:53.916 --> 00:55.250
Got a cool new boot.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.541
Courtesy of my brilliant nephew.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.333
Have a great one, Sayaka.

01:00.416 --> 01:01.875
Hey, Aunt Cass.

01:01.958 --> 01:04.083
-Baymax didn't come home last night.
-What?

01:04.250 --> 01:06.916
I think he's stuck out there
somewhere with a dead battery.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.583
-He's lost?
-More like offline.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.333
But this shows me where he's been
the past few days.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.583
Wow. We gotta get out more.

01:16.833 --> 01:19.750
It's a pretty big search area,
but I can go look for him.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.625
Know you don't like to close the cafe...

01:21.708 --> 01:23.416
-Everybody out!
-ALL: Huh?

01:24.041 --> 01:25.750
That may have come out a little harsh.

01:25.833 --> 01:29.541
I'm just having a little family situation.
You know what I'm saying?

01:29.625 --> 01:30.750
Thank you.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.041
-Okay.
-We're going to need a search party.

01:35.125 --> 01:37.333
-I got a list of his recent patients here.
-Cool.

01:37.416 --> 01:38.458
(DOORBELL RINGS)

01:40.541 --> 01:41.541
Hello!

01:42.416 --> 01:43.791
Uh...

01:43.875 --> 01:45.500
I...

01:45.583 --> 01:47.166
I'm Hiro.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.458
-And this is my Aunt Cass.
-Hi.

01:49.541 --> 01:52.083
It says here that Baymax
treated you recently,

01:52.166 --> 01:54.541
and it just so happens
that he's gone missing.

01:54.625 --> 01:57.208
-We were wondering if you would help us...
-Oh!

01:57.791 --> 01:59.041
That seems bad.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.291
And yet, not all that surprising.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.916
Let's save Borax.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.208
Oh... (CHUCKLES)

02:06.291 --> 02:08.000
His name's actually Baymax...

02:08.083 --> 02:09.333
Mmm-mmm.

02:10.166 --> 02:11.916
Here you go, Kara. Enjoy.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.958
Thanks, Mbita. I'm loving this new menu.

02:14.041 --> 02:15.916
-WOMAN: Hey, Chef.
-Hi.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.416
-Borax is in danger.
-She means Baymax.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.375
We could use some help looking for him.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.958
He was here, right?

02:23.166 --> 02:24.250
Get in the truck.

02:26.541 --> 02:29.583
Hi. We're putting together
a search party to find my robot,

02:29.666 --> 02:30.750
Baymax.

02:30.833 --> 02:33.666
-I think he helped you recently with...
-My period.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.875
-I'm in
-Okay.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.375
Let's go find Baymax.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.166
I just hope he's not in any trouble.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.041
All right. Charges is set.

02:42.125 --> 02:43.583
MAN: Okay. Let's seal it up.

03:12.416 --> 03:14.166
-Hello.
-(SCREECHES)

03:14.583 --> 03:15.583
Here you go.

03:26.833 --> 03:27.958
-Anything?
-Nope.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.958
-I checked the whole block.
-No sign of him.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.625
We've gotta find him, Aunt Cass.

03:31.708 --> 03:33.333
It looks like someone found a friend.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.291
Hey, look at that.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.333
A freshly nibbled red lollipop.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.791
And that's one of Baymax's.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Oh.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.875
I think he was trying
to treat this little cat. Hey!

03:45.416 --> 03:46.666
Come here.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.333
Yes. Look, kitty.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.916
Where's the big guy that gave you this?

03:52.375 --> 03:53.375
You know...

03:54.291 --> 03:55.750
(IMITATING) Hello. I am Borax.

03:55.833 --> 03:58.750
I will make you face your deepest fears.
Have a lollipop.

03:58.875 --> 04:00.916
-That's actually pretty good.
-Uh-uh.

04:03.708 --> 04:04.708
Follow that cat.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.625
What is it with Baymax and warehouses?

04:23.750 --> 04:25.750
Hey, buddy, I need to get in there.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.291
No, ma'am. Site is sealed
and cleared for demolition.

04:28.375 --> 04:29.375
No one goes in.

04:29.458 --> 04:32.541
-But our friend's in there.
-A big, wonderful robot.

04:32.625 --> 04:33.625
A robot?

04:33.708 --> 04:37.166
(SCOFFS) Sorry, folks.
Wish I could give you your toy back.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.541
But as soon as I finish my lunch,
that building's coming down.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.916
-A toy? Really?
-What now?

04:44.958 --> 04:47.166
You heard the man. It's time for lunch.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.791
(SNIFFS)

04:49.875 --> 04:52.625
-What is that fantastic smell?
-Huh?

04:53.875 --> 04:55.625
Oh, my apologies.

04:55.708 --> 04:58.375
Is the smell of my braised
short rib kimchi stir fry

04:58.458 --> 05:00.791
-ruining your lunch?
-Comes with free coffee.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.125
-I'm here. On the way.
-Yes.

05:08.833 --> 05:09.916
Shall we?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.458
WOMAN: I'll take a teriyaki bowl.
MAN: Got any fish tacos?

05:12.541 --> 05:13.625
No fish.

05:16.166 --> 05:17.166
(GRUNTING)

05:18.000 --> 05:19.416
The building's welded shut.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.041
(MEOWS)

05:23.583 --> 05:24.666
Looks like a way in.

05:25.541 --> 05:28.208
Hang on.
I've got something that might help.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Check out that sorcery.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.458
Hurry! I don't know
how long I can hold this.

05:39.541 --> 05:40.541
Lead the way, cat.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.416
Whoa. Don't. No, you don't.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.833
-Balloon man.
-Oh, no.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.250
Come on, grab an end.

06:00.458 --> 06:01.500
(GROANS)

06:01.583 --> 06:02.583
There you go, buddy.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Been hitting the pool. I'm all muscle.

06:06.708 --> 06:08.833
All right. This is taking way too long.

06:08.916 --> 06:12.833
Cass, I just realized we have
our 1000th customer.

06:12.916 --> 06:14.291
-(GASPS) What?
-Yeah!

06:14.541 --> 06:16.666
-Sound the alarm!
-(HONKING)

06:18.250 --> 06:19.250
We gotta go.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.500
Okay, there...

06:23.583 --> 06:24.583
(BOTH GASP)

06:26.541 --> 06:27.583
That seems bad.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.916
-All right, let's get this party started.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.750
-Pull!
-Okay, I'm trying!

06:41.833 --> 06:44.458
It's like trying to shove
a burrito in a soda can.

06:44.583 --> 06:45.791
Ten.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000

(MEOWS)

07:11.833 --> 07:12.833
Hold everything.

-Baymax!

07:43.958 --> 07:46.166
It appears I am fully operational.

But how do you feel, Baymax?

07:55.333 --> 07:57.541
I am satisfied with my care.
