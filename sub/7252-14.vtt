00:02.002 --> 00:03.712
Your grandmother and I

00:02.002 --> 00:03.712
have reconciled.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.046
(Emily)

00:03.754 --> 00:05.046
'And next week,

00:03.754 --> 00:05.046
your father and I'

00:05.088 --> 00:07.048
are going to renew

00:05.088 --> 00:07.048
our wedding vows.

00:07.090 --> 00:09.844
I wanna spend

00:07.090 --> 00:09.844
some time with you.

00:09.885 --> 00:10.970
No strings attached.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.557
- Grandma wants a picture.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.557
- Of this?

00:15.599 --> 00:19.269
Lorelai, this thing

00:15.599 --> 00:19.269
we're doing here, me, you

00:19.311 --> 00:22.272
I just want you to know I'm in.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.272
I am all in.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.441
He's completely unsuitable

00:22.314 --> 00:24.441
for Lorelai.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.776
'If you want a chance

00:24.483 --> 00:25.776
with Lorelai'

00:25.818 --> 00:26.902
you had better do something.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.612
Come on in, friend.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.323
I could just say his father died

00:28.654 --> 00:31.323
and I went over to comfort him

00:31.365 --> 00:33.993
with tequila, which we drank

00:31.365 --> 00:33.993
all night long, alone.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.662
He didn't need to know. It's

00:34.034 --> 00:36.662
better that he doesn't know.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.747
Christopher's father died

00:36.704 --> 00:38.747
a couple weeks ago.

00:38.789 --> 00:41.041
I went over there one night,

00:38.789 --> 00:41.041
and we talked, and drank.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.210
Just two old friends

00:41.082 --> 00:43.210
hanging out, that's all.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.879
- You went over there.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.879
- It might come up.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.964
I don't want you

00:44.920 --> 00:46.964
to feel shanghaied.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.298
Yeah, that would be bad.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.341

00:49.383 --> 00:50.885
Lorelai and I belong together.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178
Everyone knows it. I know it.

00:50.926 --> 00:53.178
Emily knows it.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.305
Luke, I-I don't know

00:53.220 --> 00:55.305
what he's talking about.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.348
I gotta get out of here.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.516
Get away from me, Christopher.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.559
I just wanna talk.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.519
Get some coffee, Christopher.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.103
This wasn't the way

01:00.561 --> 01:02.103
I wanted it to go down.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.772
I wanted to get you alone and..

01:02.145 --> 01:03.772
What are you doing?

01:03.814 --> 01:04.982
I'm going after Luke.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.984
Oh, there you are.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.819
I've got her.

01:08.861 --> 01:13.281
Oh, you cannot keep

01:08.861 --> 01:13.281
a room full of Anglo-Saxons

01:13.323 --> 01:17.953
waiting for cake this long.

01:13.323 --> 01:17.953
They start to form more clubs.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.120
Take her. Take her. Take her.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.789
Alright. Wonderful.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.791
There we are.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.378
Okay, everyone in

01:22.833 --> 01:26.378
just a little closer.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.171
'That's perfect. Hold that.'

01:30.215 --> 01:33.134
- You and me, we're done.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.134
- One, two, three.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.725
- Are you leaving?

01:36.805 --> 01:39.725
- Party's over. It is so over.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.309
- Are you okay?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.309
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.604
- It's just time to go.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.604
- Are we okay?

01:43.645 --> 01:45.731
I mean, that wasn't exactly

01:43.645 --> 01:45.731
my proudest moment.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.233
Oh, honey,

01:45.773 --> 01:48.233
you're the daughter of a woman

01:48.275 --> 01:50.402
who has had no end

01:48.275 --> 01:50.402
of less-than-proud moments.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.654
- Don't worry.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.654
- Luke was so mad.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.281
That's because to Luke,

01:52.696 --> 01:54.281
you're still ten years old

01:54.322 --> 01:56.408
wearing feathered angel's wings,

going door to door

01:56.450 --> 01:58.077
inviting people

01:56.450 --> 01:58.077
to a caterpillar's funeral.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.203
- Oh, now, I did that once.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.203
- Luke is fine.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.123
- I hope so.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.123
- Look, go back in.

Catch up with Logan.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.626
Tell him everything is fine.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.377
He went right

02:05.667 --> 02:07.377
to his car and split.

02:07.419 --> 02:08.629
I don't blame the boy.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.130
And what's with you

02:08.670 --> 02:10.130

02:10.171 --> 02:12.633
- All these questions.

02:10.171 --> 02:12.633
- Sorry.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.719
Look, go back in, huh?

02:12.674 --> 02:15.719
Make the best of things.

Luke is just, uh,

02:15.761 --> 02:18.472

02:18.513 --> 02:20.808
- I'll talk to you later.

go somewhere tonight?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.623
- Yeah.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.623
- You get separated?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.333
Something like that.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.333
So have you seen him?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.503
Not unless I fell asleep,

04:10.375 --> 04:13.503

he's not back.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.051
Right. So you didn't come back

- 'Okay.'

04:24.598 --> 04:26.516
And if you talk to him,

04:24.598 --> 04:26.516
could you maybe not mention

- Bite me.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.902
Were there any messages

06:40.150 --> 06:41.902
for me?

06:41.943 --> 06:44.779
Yes, four other people called

06:41.943 --> 06:44.779
and asked that you bite me.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.741
[sighs]

06:44.821 --> 06:47.741
Look, I'm serious here.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.741
Come on, Paris.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.701
It is especially

06:47.782 --> 06:49.701
important tonight that

06:49.743 --> 06:52.120
if there was a message for me,

06:49.743 --> 06:52.120
that that message gets to me.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.788
If there was a message,

06:52.162 --> 06:53.788
I would have left it

06:53.830 --> 06:54.956
on the message board.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
The board is blank,

06:54.998 --> 06:56.917
and you are not

06:56.958 --> 06:58.417
the most reliable

06:56.958 --> 06:58.417
message leaver.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.337
- No messages.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.337
- Okay.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.839
I don't mean to insult you,

07:00.379 --> 07:02.839
but are you maybe telling me

07:02.881 --> 07:04.758
that there's no message because

07:02.881 --> 07:04.758
you're mad that I woke you

07:04.799 --> 07:06.051
and there really was a message?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.427
Oh, my God.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.427
You're annoying tonight.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.097
What's with being

07:08.469 --> 07:10.097
all k.d. lang?

07:10.138 --> 07:13.016
It was for my grandparents'

07:10.138 --> 07:13.016
vow renewal. I was the best man.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.269
- They kinky or something?

07:13.058 --> 07:15.269
- It was a cute thing.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.271
- So, who's the boy?

07:15.310 --> 07:17.271
- What boy?

07:17.312 --> 07:19.022
The boy you're dying

07:17.312 --> 07:19.022
to get a message from.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.524
- I assume it's a boy.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.524
- Not necessarily.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.652
Well, no one called,

07:21.566 --> 07:24.652
left a note, smoke signaled

07:24.694 --> 07:26.154
Morse coded,

07:24.694 --> 07:26.154

07:26.196 --> 07:28.823
or came by, male, female,

07:26.196 --> 07:28.823
or hermaphrodite.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.825
Okay, thanks.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.870
I'm wide awake. It's your fault.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.870
You owe me Boggle.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.205
- Paris.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.205
- Boggle.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.915
One game, and then

07:35.247 --> 07:36.915
it's back to bed.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.960
[electro music]

07:54.057 --> 07:56.810
Hey, Lorelai.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.186
Kirk, you're dripping wet.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.980
"Sweat is the curse

07:58.228 --> 07:59.980
of the B-Boy."

08:00.021 --> 08:03.108
Mos Def.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.108
So are you feeling better?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.986
- Yeah, I'm feeling fine. Why?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.986
- Luke told me you weren't well.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.655
- Luke? You've seen Luke?

08:06.027 --> 08:08.655
- He came to the movie theater.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.949
I'm on my break so I figured

08:08.696 --> 08:10.949
I'd come down

08:10.991 --> 08:12.409
and bust a sweet move.

08:12.451 --> 08:15.787
- When? When?

08:12.451 --> 08:15.787
- Uh, about a half hour ago.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.081
I asked about you, and he said

08:15.829 --> 08:18.081
you weren't feeling well.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.375
Then he rejected

08:18.123 --> 08:20.375
my Buy two junior mints

08:20.417 --> 08:22.502

08:20.417 --> 08:22.502
of onion beef jerky offer

08:22.543 --> 08:24.921
with a disgusting profanity,

08:22.543 --> 08:24.921
then took a seat.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.506
- So he's there now?

08:24.963 --> 08:26.506
- Probably.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.133
Nothing's up with you two,

08:26.547 --> 08:28.133
is there?

08:28.175 --> 08:29.426
I mean, he seemed just fine.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.094
No, nothing.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.094
Nothing's wrong at all.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.388
- Uh-oh.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.388
- Kirk, we have not broken up.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.807
But why are you guys dressed up

08:33.430 --> 08:35.807
but not together?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.976
Luke's in a suit,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.976
which seems oddly formal

08:38.018 --> 08:40.354
for a movie theater

08:38.018 --> 08:40.354
that recycles its popcorn.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.272
Oh, well, we had

08:40.395 --> 08:42.272
a fancy event to go to.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.525
Um, then I got the sniffles, and

08:42.314 --> 08:45.525
so Luke decided to see a movie

08:45.566 --> 08:47.402
but now I'm feeling better,

08:45.566 --> 08:47.402
so I came looking for him.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.778
I hope that's true,

08:47.444 --> 08:48.778
because Taylor

08:48.820 --> 08:50.697
would go nuts

08:48.820 --> 08:50.697
if you two broke up.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.699
Well, that is not the case so

08:50.738 --> 08:52.699
there's nothing to worry about.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.992
Do you think he's still there?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.660
The movie just started

08:54.034 --> 08:55.660
when I left.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.287
Great. Thanks a lot, Kirk.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.497
So I can go in without paying?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.374
- No!

08:58.538 --> 09:00.374
- Thank you.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.315
- What are you watching?

09:22.479 --> 09:25.315
- Something stupid.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.983
- 'I'm terribly sorry.'

09:25.357 --> 09:26.983
- That's alright.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.609
I'd never have brought you here

09:27.025 --> 09:28.609
if I thought they were gonna

09:28.651 --> 09:30.778
humiliate you, this is the

09:28.651 --> 09:30.778
first time I've ever been caught

09:30.820 --> 09:32.697
needing anything,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.697
and you helped me do it.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.409
(Lorelai)

09:32.739 --> 09:35.409
'Man, they sure talked fast

09:32.739 --> 09:35.409
in those things.'

09:35.450 --> 09:38.537
Yeah, they, uh, they did.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.579
Fast.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.334
I've been frantically

09:41.748 --> 09:44.334
trying to call your cellphone.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.711
I turned it off.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.547
That's what I figured.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.926
So, do you wanna hear

09:50.840 --> 09:52.926
my explanations?

09:52.967 --> 09:54.719
'Cause I've got 'em.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.474
I've got 'em all and

09:56.804 --> 09:59.474
I'm dying to share 'em with you.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.060
I just need some time.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.687
- Time..

10:02.102 --> 10:04.687
- A little time to think.

10:06.481 --> 10:08.691
And to process.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.943
Right.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.613
I get that.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.613
I really do get that.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.825
I just have so much

10:16.116 --> 10:17.825
I wanna say to you.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.455
Not right now, okay?

10:17.867 --> 10:21.455
I need to clear my head.

10:27.001 --> 10:31.339
Uh, okay, but you'll call me

10:27.001 --> 10:31.339
when you're ready?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.092
- Yeah.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.092
- Okay, good. Okay.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.431

10:57.616 --> 11:00.201

10:57.616 --> 11:00.201
arrive, we'll gather them here

11:00.243 --> 11:01.786
in the living room,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.786
we'll have the pocket doors

11:01.828 --> 11:04.414
to the dining room closed, then

11:01.828 --> 11:04.414
when it's time for breakfast

11:04.456 --> 11:06.040
we'll open the doors, and<i> voila</i>

11:06.082 --> 11:07.417
you'll get the full,

11:06.082 --> 11:07.417
beautiful effect.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.918
- Wonderful.

11:07.459 --> 11:08.918
- We'll add music.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.670
Have a nice little fanfare.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.670
You like Yanni?

11:12.339 --> 11:13.965
We're in perfect sync.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.801
Uh, and then we'll have

11:14.007 --> 11:16.801
small-scale tables set

11:16.843 --> 11:19.095
with china

11:16.843 --> 11:19.095
and a silver tea service

11:19.137 --> 11:20.847
little plates, little cups,

11:19.137 --> 11:20.847
and 12 little chairs

11:20.888 --> 11:21.973
for all of them to sit on.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.517
- That's so cute.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.517
- Yeah.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.144
Wait, 12? I thought there were

11:23.558 --> 11:26.144
six, six little girls.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.605
- Six girls and their six dolls.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.605
- I beg your pardon.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.940
This is a pancake breakfast

11:28.647 --> 11:30.940
for the girls and their dolls.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.276
- Get out of town.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.276
- I thought you knew that.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.862
Dolls, as in they don't have

11:33.318 --> 11:35.862
stomachs, lungs or spleens

11:35.903 --> 11:37.614
and we are serving them

11:35.903 --> 11:37.614
breakfast?

11:37.656 --> 11:39.282
- That's right.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.282
- Teeth, throats, colons.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.617
They don't have these either

11:40.659 --> 11:42.035
unless they are

11:40.659 --> 11:42.035
"Brides Of Chucky."

11:42.076 --> 11:43.537
Not paying attention

11:42.076 --> 11:43.537
to you anymore.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.413
Alright, well,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.413
I'll order everything

11:45.455 --> 11:46.956
and all you have to do

11:45.455 --> 11:46.956
is show up.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.833
The girls are looking forward

11:46.998 --> 11:48.833
to this.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.918
- So are the dolls.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.918
- Ah, I love that.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.462
- Bye.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.462
- Okay. Bye-bye.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.756
- Is she psychotic?

11:54.005 --> 11:55.756
- Shh!

11:58.009 --> 11:59.886
They're just having

11:58.009 --> 11:59.886
a little silly fun, Michel.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.846
Girls love dolls, so chill.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.598
I'm making little pancakes

12:01.888 --> 12:03.598
for the dolls too

12:03.640 --> 12:05.559
and I found these little forks

12:03.640 --> 12:05.559
they can use.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.644
They do not have

12:05.600 --> 12:07.644
opposable thumbs.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.812
Who the girls? Oh,

12:07.686 --> 12:09.812
this is a handicapped group?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.898
- Poor things.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.898
- No, the dolls.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.525
The dolls?

12:11.939 --> 12:13.525
How can a doll be handicapped?

12:13.567 --> 12:16.194
My point exactly. They are

12:13.567 --> 12:16.194
plastic and made in Banglagor.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.572
We're doing this,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.572
so hop on board or hop off.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.949
Okay, you don't need

12:18.613 --> 12:21.949
to snap my nose off.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.201
He's getting on your nerves,

12:21.991 --> 12:23.201
huh?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.704
Completely.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.704
I'm starving.

12:25.744 --> 12:27.539
Didn't you have anything

12:25.744 --> 12:27.539
at Luke's today?

12:27.581 --> 12:30.625
No, not today.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.625
There's no food in this fridge.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.834
It's stuffed with food.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.794
I'm talking food that's edible.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.005
Food to consume. Everything

12:33.836 --> 12:36.005
in here, you have to cook.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.383
- I'm a cook.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.383
- No, forget it.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
- What's wrong?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
- Nothing.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.637
Luke and I had a little

12:40.468 --> 12:42.637
disagreement last night.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.846
At the wedding?

12:42.679 --> 12:43.846
What happened?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.973
- Christopher showed up.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.973
- Oh, no.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.142
- My mother invited him.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.142
- Oh, no.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.895
And I hadn't exactly told Luke

12:48.184 --> 12:50.895
about that tequila night

12:50.937 --> 12:53.314
with Chris after his dad died,

12:50.937 --> 12:53.314
and so I told him

12:53.356 --> 12:55.233
and there was a big blow up,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.233
and Chris went nuts

12:55.275 --> 12:57.860
and Luke went nuts,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.860
and he got mad, and he left.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.154
And now he says

12:57.902 --> 13:00.154
he needs time to think.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.365
- How much time?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.365
- He just said time.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.576
Oh, I hate when men do that.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.576
It's so vague.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.580
I should have told him when

13:04.618 --> 13:08.580
it happened, but I blew it.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.332
Now if he'd just give me ten

13:08.622 --> 13:11.332
minutes, we could hash it out

13:11.374 --> 13:13.960
and-and be back on our way,

13:11.374 --> 13:13.960
and not waste time.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.836
- What's enough time?

13:14.001 --> 13:15.836
- I don't know.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.130
It's been 12 hours.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.590
- That enough?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.590
- I'd say no.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.508
I'm gonna be distracted

13:18.632 --> 13:20.508
until we fix this.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.636
Well, don't worry

13:20.550 --> 13:22.636
because when a relationship

13:22.677 --> 13:24.262
is right, things work out.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.846
Hmm, I hope so.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.475
I heard about this couple

13:25.888 --> 13:28.475
on one of those morning shows.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.518
Similar to you guys,

13:28.516 --> 13:30.518
all lovey-dovey

13:30.560 --> 13:33.563
perfect for each other,

13:30.560 --> 13:33.563
you know headed for marriage

13:33.605 --> 13:35.607
and-and-and something happened,

13:33.605 --> 13:35.607
and they broke up

13:35.649 --> 13:37.191
in their senior year in college

13:37.233 --> 13:39.902
even though they were madly

13:37.233 --> 13:39.902
in love with each other.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.113
Oh, they moved to different

13:39.944 --> 13:42.113
parts of the country.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.157
They-they married

13:42.155 --> 13:44.157
different people.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.575
They married different people?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.453
Oh, had kids, grandkids.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.453
Then their spouses died.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
Oh, and they were available

13:48.495 --> 13:50.455
again

13:50.497 --> 13:52.415
and they talked,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.415
and they hooked up

13:52.457 --> 13:55.502
and now they're together.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.172
And they're happily in love

13:55.543 --> 13:59.172
after 40 years apart. Aah!

13:59.213 --> 14:02.091
- That's a horrible story.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.091
- No, it's not.

14:02.133 --> 14:04.177
What morning show was that on?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.177
I hate that story.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.262
- But they ended up together.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.262
- Was it Katie Couric?

14:06.304 --> 14:07.764
She seems very dark to me.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.766
The point is that

14:07.806 --> 14:09.766
even if it takes 40 years

14:09.808 --> 14:12.477
to figure it out, there's still

14:09.808 --> 14:12.477
a chance for a happy ending.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.020
But that's all they had.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.020
An ending.

14:14.061 --> 14:15.730
I don't wanna have

14:14.061 --> 14:15.730
just an ending with Luke.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.691
- I know, but--

14:15.772 --> 14:17.691
- I don't want stupid kids.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.526
Or those ugly grandkids

14:17.732 --> 14:19.526
with that loser other guy.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.653
You don't know.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.653
He could be a nice guy.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.780
Even if he's a nice guy, he's

14:21.695 --> 14:23.780
not the guy I wanna be with.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.198
You're right.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.198
It's not fair to him.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
It's not fair to him.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
It's dishonest.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.118
We should name the other guy.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.118
I feel like he'd be a Larry.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.911
- I'm not naming the other guy.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.911
- 'Okay.'

14:30.953 --> 14:33.247
I guess it was a bad example.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.247
Sorry.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.791
Oh, that's okay.

14:34.833 --> 14:38.628
But you know,

14:34.833 --> 14:38.628
I read a story about another guy

14:38.670 --> 14:40.254
that had a fight

14:38.670 --> 14:40.254
with his girlfriend.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.549
And he said he needed

14:40.296 --> 14:42.549
like a week to think it over

14:42.590 --> 14:45.510
and he only needed a day, and he

14:42.590 --> 14:45.510
and the girl were back together

14:45.552 --> 14:48.847
and were happy forever.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.847
No Larry, or loser kids.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.431
- Or anything.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.431
- Uh-huh.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.850
They don't put stuff like that

14:50.473 --> 14:51.850
in the newspapers

14:51.891 --> 14:54.018
'cause it's not as sexy

14:51.891 --> 14:54.018
as the 40-year story

14:54.060 --> 14:56.145
but it happens all the time,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.145
really.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.647
- Thanks for making that up.

14:56.187 --> 14:57.647
- You're welcome.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.273
I'm gonna go take a walk.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.941
I got some errands to run.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.861
Good. Go clear your head.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.572
- And it was Katie Couric.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.572
- I knew it.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.532
[guitar music]

15:09.617 --> 15:11.327
Don't forget the raisin bran.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.327
It's good for you.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.581
- Keeps you moving.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.581
- Whatever that means.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.416
Eww! I just got what that means.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.168
Cognitive skills are slow today.

15:16.457 --> 15:19.168
Grab some cornflakes.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.337
Nietzsche and Wittgenstein

15:19.210 --> 15:21.337
went ape guano over cornflakes.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.506
So they make you smart,

15:21.379 --> 15:23.506
German, and depressed.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.716
Why do they have

15:23.548 --> 15:24.716
so much Wheat Chex?

15:24.758 --> 15:26.300
It doesn't go with anything.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.844
Wheat Chex is sort of

15:26.342 --> 15:27.844
the pumpernickel bread

15:27.886 --> 15:28.553
of the cereal world.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.804
Well put.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.723
So what combo

15:29.846 --> 15:31.723
were you thinking today?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.974
Cap'n Crunch over a foundation

15:31.765 --> 15:33.974
of Rice Krispies

15:34.016 --> 15:35.476
with a perimeter

15:34.016 --> 15:35.476
of Shredded Wheat.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.895
- Bold.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.895
- I like its prospects.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.063
- I love cereal.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.063
- It rocks.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.064
Mm.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.192
So you never told me

15:41.566 --> 15:43.192
who the guy was?

15:43.234 --> 15:44.652
Guy?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.237
The guy you were dying

15:44.694 --> 15:46.237
for a message from.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.947
The guy who has you yoked

15:46.279 --> 15:47.947
to your cellphone.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.866
I am not yoked to my cellphone.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.033
I can't hear it

15:49.908 --> 15:51.033
when it's in my pocket.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.535
Oh, God!

15:52.577 --> 15:54.621
- Tell me it's not Huntzberger.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.621
- What if it is?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.997
With the hair and the chin

15:54.662 --> 15:56.997
like he's a fourth Bee Gee?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
You know, I can put the phone

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
away if it's bothering you.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.670
Don't. That pathetic boat

15:59.041 --> 16:02.670
you're in, I'm first oarsman.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.923
- How so?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.923
- 'Waiting for Doyle's call.'

16:04.964 --> 16:07.425
I expected a call yesterday to

16:04.964 --> 16:07.425
set something up for last night

16:07.467 --> 16:10.177
but it never came,

16:07.467 --> 16:10.177
so I ate a family-size bag

16:10.219 --> 16:12.722
of salt and vinegar potato chips

16:10.219 --> 16:12.722
and went to bed at 7:30.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.808
- That was the smell.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.808
- We're better than this.

16:14.849 --> 16:17.143
You and me, we're the children

16:14.849 --> 16:17.143
of Emma Goldman

16:17.184 --> 16:19.979
and Hillary Clinton,

16:17.184 --> 16:19.979
strong, independent.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.648
- We're better than this.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.648
- Apparently not.

16:21.689 --> 16:25.526
I blame Chilton. Great education

16:21.689 --> 16:25.526
but horrific socialization.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.612
- We need guidance.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.612
- I'm not calling "Loveline."

16:27.654 --> 16:29.948
Rory, come on, we're sitting

16:27.654 --> 16:29.948
in a sea of expertise

16:29.989 --> 16:31.407
in this field,

16:29.989 --> 16:31.407
the college campus.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.200
there's no end

16:31.449 --> 16:33.200
of knock-headed bimbos

16:33.242 --> 16:36.036
with tons of dross to dispense.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.036
There's two now.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.790
- Paris, don't.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.790
- 'Althea, Janet, come here .'

16:38.832 --> 16:40.583
You hate Althea and Janet.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.460
Granted they know nothing

16:40.625 --> 16:42.460
of Ukrainian politics

16:42.502 --> 16:44.128
or the periodic table,

16:42.502 --> 16:44.128
but when it comes to boys

16:44.170 --> 16:45.546
they're brighter

16:44.170 --> 16:45.546
than the Brontes.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.757
- What, Paris?

16:45.588 --> 16:47.757
- Hey, Janet. Hey, Althea.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.301
Girls, we have related problems.

16:47.799 --> 16:50.301
A little love trouble.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.428
- Can we bend you ears?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.428
- Uh, sure.

16:52.470 --> 16:55.097
No, Althea, please,

16:52.470 --> 16:55.097
go enjoy your Sunday.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.349
There's no love trouble here.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.892
- I don't mind.

16:56.390 --> 16:57.892
- I do.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.644
Fine, then I'll just

16:57.934 --> 16:59.644
lay out my situation.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.647
- Great, 'cause I'm out of this.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.647
- Okay, so I've got a guy.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.023
- Blind?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.023
- Can it.

17:04.064 --> 17:05.817
The last time I saw him,

17:04.064 --> 17:05.817
he strongly implied

17:05.859 --> 17:07.652
that he was going

17:05.859 --> 17:07.652
to call me, and soon.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.904
- It's been four days.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.904
- You ever call him to hook up?

17:09.946 --> 17:11.948
- He's always taken the reins.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.948
- What did he say exactly?

17:11.990 --> 17:13.407
Call you later

17:11.990 --> 17:13.407
or see you later?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.994
- Call. Or was it see?

17:13.449 --> 17:15.994
- Very different.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.912
Call's more descriptive,

17:16.035 --> 17:17.912
if he said call you later

17:17.954 --> 17:19.956
and didn't,

17:17.954 --> 17:19.956
it's an egregious screw you.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.375
- 'Pretty sure it was see.'

17:19.998 --> 17:22.375
- You could cut him some slack.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.668
- You like him, right?

17:22.416 --> 17:23.668
- Yeah.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.211
Then call him but have a reason.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.504
- We're on the paper together.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.504
- Perfect.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.755
Call to ask for notes

17:26.546 --> 17:27.755
or something

17:27.797 --> 17:29.256
but don't give him

17:27.797 --> 17:29.256
anything else.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.800
'If he's into you,

17:29.298 --> 17:30.800
he'll take it from there.'

17:30.842 --> 17:32.552
'If he's not, at least you know.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.552
So you can dump him. '

17:32.593 --> 17:35.221
Direct. Simple.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.221
A clear path. Thank you.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.389
- Mm.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.389
- You're welcome.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.307
- See you.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.307
- Um, excuse me.

17:38.349 --> 17:39.600
Yeah?

17:39.642 --> 17:40.935
If you don't mind,

17:39.642 --> 17:40.935
I'm wondering--

17:40.977 --> 17:42.687
Yeah?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.939
Okay. I got close to kind of

17:42.729 --> 17:44.939
getting together with a guy.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.607
You mean like getting together

17:44.981 --> 17:46.607
<i>getting together?</i>

17:46.649 --> 17:48.442
Yeah, but we were interrupted.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.236
Shouldn't he

17:48.484 --> 17:50.236
be calling me to talk

17:50.277 --> 17:52.196
or maybe set up

17:50.277 --> 17:52.196
getting together?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.157
- What was the interruption?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.157
- Mom. Then dad.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.242
Then mom's boyfriend.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.036
- Whoa.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.036
- Poor guy.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.453
Okay. You definitely

17:58.077 --> 17:59.453
have to call him.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.039
- Really?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.039
- He might be afraid to call.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.374
- Thinks you're too much drama.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.374
- Too much drama.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.334
You give him a call,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.334
but keep it casual.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.294
She's love dense.

18:05.376 --> 18:07.294
Give her specific language.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.796
- Get together.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.796
- Or hang out.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.507
- That's better.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.507
- Ask him to hang out sometime.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.843
It will give him an easy out.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.843
If he says yes, meet up.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.386
Act casual, but look hot.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.846
I've got a pen

18:15.428 --> 18:16.846
if you wanna write this down.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.973
No. I think I can remember.

18:16.888 --> 18:18.973
Thank you.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.809
- No problem.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.809
- Any time.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.978
Styrofoam for brains,

18:21.851 --> 18:23.978
but they know their stuff.

18:26.146 --> 18:29.067
[indistinct chattering]

18:39.953 --> 18:41.621
I'm on your side, Lorelai.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.581
Whoa, yo, Gypsy.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.581
What are you talking about?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.165
- The break-up.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.165
- What break-up?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.043
- Yours and Luke's.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.043
- We're not broken up.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.336
Break-up, split-up, separated,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.336
whatever you wanna call it.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.755
I 'd like to call it nothing.

18:49.378 --> 18:50.755
We're fine.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.172
And what is with these ribbons?

18:52.214 --> 18:54.550
Pink for you, blue for Luke.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.550
It's Taylor's idea.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.927
That way, we all know

18:54.592 --> 18:55.927
who's side we're on

18:55.969 --> 18:57.303
without having to talk

18:55.969 --> 18:57.303
to each other.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.388
- He's a freak, but I like pink.

18:57.344 --> 18:59.388
- Oh, my God.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.390
Look out. Blue incoming.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.183
Gypsy, please,

19:01.432 --> 19:03.183
take that ribbon off.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.894
I don't want anyone

19:03.225 --> 19:04.894
encouraging Taylor on this.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.187
Oh, it's way too late.

19:04.936 --> 19:07.187
He's passed out hundreds.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.065
- Hundreds?

19:07.229 --> 19:09.065
- It was no choice for me.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.150
Luke fixes his own truck,

19:09.107 --> 19:11.150
so I make bumpkins off him.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.277
But you, you don't know

19:11.191 --> 19:13.277
a piston from a pepperoni.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.362
Lots of money in ignorance.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.362
I'm with you.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.449
Okay, great. I'll catch up

19:15.404 --> 19:18.449
with you later.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.285
Pink power, baby!

19:18.491 --> 19:21.285
We chicks gotta stick together.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.708
- Lorelai.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.708
- I'll deal with you later.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.837
Luke, hi, I-I'm sorry

19:27.750 --> 19:30.837
to sneak up on you like this

19:30.878 --> 19:32.630
but please just give me

19:30.878 --> 19:32.630
a minute. We need to talk.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.174
I have so much to say.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.136
I-I should have told you about

19:35.215 --> 19:38.136
that night with Christopher.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.054
- I know that now.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.054
- Yeah, okay, I--

19:40.096 --> 19:42.348
But I swear, the visit

19:40.096 --> 19:42.348
we had was so innocent.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.934
It was about his dad.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.934
And nothing happened.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.894
- Less than nothing happened.

19:44.976 --> 19:46.894
- But you hid it.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.940
I know, and I shouldn't have,

19:46.936 --> 19:50.940
and I am so, so sorry.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.484
But all that talk from

19:50.982 --> 19:53.484
Christopher at the wedding

19:53.526 --> 19:57.321
I didn't see that coming.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.321
He was drunk. He was stupid.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.199
He's never not stupid,

19:57.363 --> 20:00.199
but I-I didn't see it coming.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.701
- You should have.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.701
- I know.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.285
Rory warned me,

20:01.742 --> 20:03.285
and I ignored her.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.622
But believe me, I am never

20:03.327 --> 20:06.622
seeing him again. Never!

20:06.664 --> 20:08.457
What are you talking about?

20:06.664 --> 20:08.457
He's Rory's father.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.543
- He'll always be in your life.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.543
- In her life.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.129
- Her life is your life.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.129
- Not when it comes to this.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.588
This is gonna happen

20:13.171 --> 20:14.588
again and again.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.965
No, it won't, Luke, I promise.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.384
God, if you care anything

20:16.007 --> 20:18.384
for me at all

20:18.425 --> 20:20.302
just please trust me on this.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.972
- I've got to go.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.972
- Luke, no. Wait.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.058
Hey, Luke, it was my mother,

20:23.014 --> 20:25.058
you know, who did all this.

20:25.099 --> 20:27.894
She was the one, she caused

20:25.099 --> 20:27.894
all this hateful stuff

20:27.935 --> 20:29.645
because Christopher is weak,

20:27.935 --> 20:29.645
and she knows that

20:29.687 --> 20:31.271
and I am never talking

20:29.687 --> 20:31.271
to her again.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.690
They're always gonna be

20:31.313 --> 20:32.690
in your life too.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.316
- Your mother, your father--

20:32.732 --> 20:34.316
- No.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.485
The Gilmores will

20:34.358 --> 20:36.485
always be in your life.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.029
- I can cut them off.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.029
- No.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.906
You just can't cut them off.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.906
It doesn't work that way.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.949
And they'll never feel

20:39.947 --> 20:41.949
differently about me ever.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.492
It doesn't matter,

20:41.991 --> 20:43.492
because they're gone.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.661
That's it. They are gone.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.661
I can do that.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.621
Alright, look, I can't have

20:45.703 --> 20:47.621
this out right now.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.749
But okay, when? Where?

20:49.790 --> 20:51.667
I need more time.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.667
I told you that.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.544
I'm afraid of this

20:51.709 --> 20:53.544
more time stuff.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.922
I'm afraid it will take 40

20:53.586 --> 20:55.922
years, and that's not good.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.757
- Lorelai.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.757
- We'll miss our middle.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.676
I want a middle,

20:57.798 --> 21:00.676
and the town is dividing us up.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.636
- I need that to stop.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.636
- Don't.

21:02.678 --> 21:07.975
Luke, I'm all in.

21:02.678 --> 21:07.975
I'm all in. Please trust me.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.478
Let me show you what

21:08.017 --> 21:11.478
a great girlfriend I can be.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.147
But I can't wait.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.147
We can't wait.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.233
I need to know what

21:13.189 --> 21:15.233
you're thinking right now.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.359
Fine, you wanna know

21:15.274 --> 21:17.359
what I'm thinking right now?

21:17.401 --> 21:19.862
That I can't be in this

21:17.401 --> 21:19.862
relationship. It's too much.

21:21.488 --> 21:22.573
No.

21:28.246 --> 21:30.330
[phone ringing]

21:30.372 --> 21:32.458
- 'Hello.'

21:30.372 --> 21:32.458
- Hi, it's Rory.

21:32.499 --> 21:34.877
Rory Gilmore,

21:32.499 --> 21:34.877
as I live and breathe.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.420
So how are you?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.798
- 'I'm good, Ace. How are you?'

21:36.462 --> 21:38.798
- I'm good.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.633
Hope your life's been less

21:38.839 --> 21:40.633
exciting since the last time.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.342
'Relatively.'

21:42.384 --> 21:44.178
Meaning you're steering clear

21:42.384 --> 21:44.178
of country club dressing rooms?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.097
- Pretty much.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.097
- 'Good.'

21:46.139 --> 21:52.019
Yeah, so I was wondering

21:46.139 --> 21:52.019
if maybe you'd--

21:52.061 --> 21:55.481
- Yeah?

21:52.061 --> 21:55.481
- If you'd like to hang out?

21:55.522 --> 21:57.775
- Or something?

21:55.522 --> 21:57.775
- Hang out.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.485
- 'Yeah.'

21:57.817 --> 21:59.485
- When?

21:59.526 --> 22:02.404
- How about tonight?

21:59.526 --> 22:02.404
- Whoa, Miss Spontaneity.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.824
I'm very of-the-moment

22:02.446 --> 22:04.824
these days.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.951
Well, sure, I'd love

22:04.865 --> 22:06.951
to hang out with you.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.661
- Come on over.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.661
- To your place?

22:08.702 --> 22:11.038
- 'Absolutely.'

22:08.702 --> 22:11.038
- Cool.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.748
- See you in a bit.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.212
[music on stereo]

22:23.550 --> 22:25.385
- Yeah.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.385
- Oh, hi.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
I don't think

22:25.427 --> 22:26.720
I'm in the right place.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.346
- 'Matty, who is it?'

22:26.762 --> 22:28.346
- Girl scout.

22:28.388 --> 22:31.391
- 'Hey, Ace, come on in.'

22:28.388 --> 22:31.391
- Come on in.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.144
Welcome to my night

22:31.433 --> 22:33.144
of humiliating defeat.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.104
- One in a series.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.104
- Don't gloat, Robert.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.354
- It's not Christian.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.354
- Neither am I.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.564
Everybody, this is Rory.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.025
- Hi.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.025
- Hey.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.442
I'd introduce you,

22:39.066 --> 22:40.442
but I don't know three of them.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.028
- It's to you, buddy.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.028
- Oh, joy.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.737
Come on, kiddo.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.737
Sit here next to me.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.572
- Is that allowed?

22:43.779 --> 22:45.572
- I wouldn't object.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.075
Come on. Be my good-luck charm.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.075
Did I raise or check?

22:48.117 --> 22:49.785
You've been eating out

22:48.117 --> 22:49.785
of aluminum pans again, buddy?

22:49.827 --> 22:51.204
Your short-term memory

22:49.827 --> 22:51.204
is non-existent.

22:51.245 --> 22:52.955
- 'Yeah, it's aluminum pans.'

22:51.245 --> 22:52.955
- Come on.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.540
The more you stall,

22:52.997 --> 22:54.540
the slower I win.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.791
That was almost

22:54.581 --> 22:55.791
grammatically correct.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.834
- Two.

22:55.833 --> 22:56.834
- Goodbye.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.336
- Call.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.336
- Hold up.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.129
- You look very nice tonight.

22:58.376 --> 23:00.129
- Oh, thanks.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.630
What do you know

23:00.171 --> 23:01.630
about this game?

23:01.672 --> 23:04.424
Um, just what I've seen on TV,

23:01.672 --> 23:04.424
"The Odd Couple."

23:04.466 --> 23:05.926
- What?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.926
- Quincy played it.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.553
But he wasn't called Quincy.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.763
Um, Oscar and Felix.

23:07.594 --> 23:09.763
Felix didn't play.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.640
Tony Randall,

23:09.805 --> 23:11.640
he cooked for them sometimes.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.893
- I am so lost.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.893
- I know a little.

23:13.934 --> 23:17.730
Well, if you know anything,

23:13.934 --> 23:17.730
you know I need a jack or a ten.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.481
- Pocket jacks.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.481
- Un-bloody-believable.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.192
- Do we bother with 5th Street?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.192
- Let's see it.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.526
- Oh!

23:22.568 --> 23:24.362
Now you're just mocking me.

23:24.402 --> 23:26.072
Hey, your gal brought

23:24.402 --> 23:26.072
someone some luck.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.948
Two Gs. Ouch!

23:27.990 --> 23:29.533
That was $2,000?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.035
- You gotta bet it to win it.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.035
- It's just money.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.995
He's down nine to me

23:31.077 --> 23:32.995
from last time.

23:33.037 --> 23:34.621
Should I send the IOU

23:33.037 --> 23:34.621
to your pop?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.249
That how you wanna work it?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.249
Cut out the middleman?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.333
Yeah, and I'll send

23:36.290 --> 23:37.333
some to your mother.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.918
- 'Oh ho ho!'

23:37.375 --> 23:38.918
- 'Oh!'

23:38.959 --> 23:41.337
A generic, unfocused and

23:38.959 --> 23:41.337
so's your mother-style comeback.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.922
You're off your game, Huntz.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.673
I'll work on a better retort

23:42.963 --> 23:44.673
and get back to you.

23:44.715 --> 23:46.466
- So you covering this?

23:44.715 --> 23:46.466
- Pardon me.

23:46.508 --> 23:48.928
You were at the last life and

23:46.508 --> 23:48.928
death shindig as I recall.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.305
Yeah, but I'm not covering this.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.305
I'm just hanging out.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.349
Yeah, back off, Robert.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.349
She's just hanging out.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.683
- Thanks, kitten.

23:53.391 --> 23:54.683
- Oh, you're welcome.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.560
- I love the service here.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.560
- I'm out.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.354
- Down to the Turks again.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.354
- I'm in.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.980
- 'Don't be a jerk, Robert.'

23:58.396 --> 23:59.980
- 'What?'

24:00.022 --> 24:01.648
You bet without looking at

24:00.022 --> 24:01.648
your cards. Look at your cards.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.276
I don't need to with Rory here.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.278
- I hate it when he does that.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.278
- You want a drink?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.946
- Me?

24:05.319 --> 24:06.946
- Yeah.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.115
Well, actually, I don't know

24:06.987 --> 24:09.115
how long I'm going to stay here

24:09.156 --> 24:10.699
so I think I'm good for now.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.160
Alright, well,

24:10.741 --> 24:13.160
the way it's going tonight

24:13.202 --> 24:15.453
I may not last through

24:13.202 --> 24:15.453
the next drink either.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.956
- 'Can we change the music?'

24:15.495 --> 24:16.956
- 'No.'

24:16.997 --> 24:18.832
- 'Since when did you become--'

24:16.997 --> 24:18.832
- 'Shut up, Colin.'

24:18.874 --> 24:20.709
(Sookie)

24:18.874 --> 24:20.709
'She's on her way.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.709
I know she is.'

24:20.751 --> 24:23.212
Well, I hope she is.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.212
Just hang in there, girls.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.839
I know you're hungry.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.839
They're getting ready to rebel.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.134
It's just that Lorelai ordered

24:25.881 --> 24:28.134
all the tables and the little

24:28.175 --> 24:30.261
china, and I'm sure it's

24:28.175 --> 24:30.261
here somewhere. It's just..

24:30.303 --> 24:32.554
Excuse me just for a second.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.554
Please help.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.598
- You're just standing there.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.598
- I'm staying out of the way.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.227
In situations like these, do not

24:34.640 --> 24:38.227
get in the way is so valuable.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.728
Well, get in the way.

24:38.269 --> 24:39.728
Entertain the kids.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.563
Like I'm Sponge Boy Big Pants

24:39.770 --> 24:41.563
or something?

24:41.605 --> 24:43.607
- I do not entertain children.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.607
- I'm getting worried.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.734
She left to do an errand

24:43.649 --> 24:45.734
yesterday and never came back.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.527
Are you dialing

24:45.776 --> 24:47.527
the right number?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.571
I think after ten years,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.571
I know Lorelai's number.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.282
- Well, where is she?

24:49.613 --> 24:51.282
- I don't know.

24:51.324 --> 24:53.284
But she was in charge of

24:51.324 --> 24:53.284
everything except the pancakes

24:53.326 --> 24:55.493
and without her,

24:53.326 --> 24:55.493
all we have are pancakes.

24:55.535 --> 24:56.996
They're expecting

24:55.535 --> 24:56.996
games and stuff.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.289
Oh, here's a fun game.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.249
Poke out all the dolls' eyes,

24:58.331 --> 25:00.249
mix them up

25:00.291 --> 25:02.168
and try to match them

25:00.291 --> 25:02.168
to the right dolls.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.877
- It's still voice mail.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.877
- Well, leave a message.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.130
I've left a million messages.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.130
I'm going to her house.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.215
- Don't leave me here.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.215
- Stall. Stall.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.050
- Hmm.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.050
- My dolly fell.

25:10.092 --> 25:13.762
- Kiss the boo-boo.

25:10.092 --> 25:13.762
- Um..

25:13.804 --> 25:16.098
What part of the dolly

25:13.804 --> 25:16.098
is the boo-boo?

25:16.140 --> 25:18.558
[instrumental music]

25:24.273 --> 25:26.817
- 'Come on, come on.'

25:24.273 --> 25:26.817
- 'I've made my decision.'

25:26.859 --> 25:29.195
- 'I'm in, 350.'

25:26.859 --> 25:29.195
- 'Call.'

25:29.236 --> 25:30.737
- I'm gonna raise.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.737
- Ass.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.115
Our gentleman's courtesies

25:30.779 --> 25:33.115
still prevails, Rob.

25:33.157 --> 25:36.160
Fine, Mr. Ass, Ass Esquire.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.163
[chuckles]

25:36.202 --> 25:39.163
He's cracked.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.163
We've cracked Robert.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.998
Morning there, Ace.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.998
How did you sleep?

25:41.040 --> 25:42.416
(Robert)

25:41.040 --> 25:42.416
'For the record,

25:41.040 --> 25:42.416
you don't snore.'

25:42.458 --> 25:44.418
We'd be happy to sign an

25:42.458 --> 25:44.418
affidavit to that effect

25:44.460 --> 25:45.919
for any prospective husband.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.545
[cellphone ringing]

25:49.423 --> 25:51.425
- Mom?

25:49.423 --> 25:51.425
- It's me, Rory. It's Sookie.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.511
Sookie?

25:51.467 --> 25:53.511
You're at the house?

25:53.551 --> 25:56.055
Look, uh, something happened

25:53.551 --> 25:56.055
with your mom and Luke

25:56.096 --> 25:58.640
and your mom's in bad shape,

25:56.096 --> 25:58.640
I mean, she's down, hon.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.601
And I-I'm here now, but

25:58.682 --> 26:01.601
I-I think you ought to come.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.812
- She needs you.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.812
- Oh, my God. Is she hurt?

26:03.854 --> 26:05.814
No, not physically.

26:03.854 --> 26:05.814
Just come, okay?

26:05.856 --> 26:07.191
I'm coming.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.109
I'm out.

26:10.403 --> 26:11.904
- You okay?

26:10.403 --> 26:11.904
- I have to go.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.447
- What happened?

26:11.945 --> 26:13.447
- I just have to go.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.907
- I have to get home.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.907
- To your dorm?

26:14.948 --> 26:16.616
Stars Hollow.

26:16.658 --> 26:18.660
Oh, no!

26:16.658 --> 26:18.660
I don't have my car.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.246
Well, didn't you walk here

26:18.702 --> 26:20.246
like 100 yards away?

26:20.287 --> 26:21.830
No, I mean, I took it in

26:21.872 --> 26:23.749
for its six month service.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.749
It's at the dealer.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.210
You take your car to the dealer?

26:23.790 --> 26:26.210
They so rip you off there.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.087
Well, it doesn't matter

26:26.252 --> 26:28.087
where it is. I don't have it.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.630
Which means that I have to take

26:28.128 --> 26:30.630
a bus, or a train, or something.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.716
- That will take hours.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.716
- I know. I have to go.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.009
Take my car.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.469
Uh, I don't wanna

26:34.051 --> 26:35.469
drive your car.

26:35.511 --> 26:36.803
No, it's a car with a driver.

26:36.845 --> 26:37.846
I've got an account

26:36.845 --> 26:37.846
with the company.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.473
- No.

26:37.888 --> 26:39.473
- Take it.

26:39.515 --> 26:41.016
I'll give Frank a call,

26:39.515 --> 26:41.016
tell him to meet you out front.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.893
He'll take good care of you.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.893
It's a done deal.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.602
Okay. Thanks.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.021
Go.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.403
- Where is she?

26:50.859 --> 26:52.403
- Upstairs.

26:52.445 --> 26:54.612
Okay, I've got it from here,

26:52.445 --> 26:54.612
Sookie. I love you.

26:57.491 --> 27:00.660
Mom? What happened?

27:00.702 --> 27:02.829
- Luke.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.829
- What about Luke?

27:02.871 --> 27:06.750
He's gone. He hates me.

27:02.871 --> 27:06.750
I blew it. I blew everything.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.668
I don't understand.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.668
What happened?

27:08.710 --> 27:10.712
I should have told him

27:08.710 --> 27:10.712
about Christopher.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.923
- That was innocent.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.923
- But I should have told him.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.675
I hid it.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.675
I shouldn't have hid it.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.053
- Try to sit up.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.053
- She got to him.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.180
- To dad? Who did?

27:18.095 --> 27:20.180
- Mom.

27:20.222 --> 27:21.890
She pushed him

27:20.222 --> 27:21.890
to ruin everything

27:21.932 --> 27:23.517
and now they're

27:21.932 --> 27:23.517
putting up ribbons.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.852
- Ribbons? Who?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.852
- Taylor, the town.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.646
They hate me. They all hate me.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.646
I wrecked everything.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.191
Mom, this isn't good.

27:28.688 --> 27:31.191
Come on. Try to sit up.

27:31.233 --> 27:34.111
He said he needed time

27:31.233 --> 27:34.111
to think, and I pushed him.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.321
He'll come around.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.574
I pushed him,

27:35.362 --> 27:38.574
and now he's gone.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.827
He waited forever for you.

27:38.616 --> 27:41.827
He's not just gonna walk away.

27:41.868 --> 27:43.329
[sobbing]

27:41.868 --> 27:43.329
It's over.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.956
Mom, this isn't you,

27:43.370 --> 27:45.956
lying in bed like this.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.041
- You should be up.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.041
- You should go to school.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.377
- Go back to school.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.377
- I'm here. I'm staying.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.838
I really screwed up this time.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.756
Shh!

27:54.798 --> 27:58.093
- He could have been the one.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.093
- He'll come around.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.595
Shh!

28:01.138 --> 28:02.640
Try to sleep.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.318
Rory?

28:28.790 --> 28:29.791
Luke?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.641
- What you watching?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.641
- Something stupid.

28:47.685 --> 28:48.935
[glass clinking]

28:52.398 --> 28:53.940
This isn't stupid.

28:55.734 --> 29:00.573
Lorelai, this thing

28:55.734 --> 29:00.573
we're doing here, me, you..

29:00.614 --> 29:03.742
...I just want you to know

29:00.614 --> 29:03.742
I'm in.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.369
I am all in.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.544
Say something.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.511
Say something!

29:31.061 --> 29:33.313
- You slept.

29:31.061 --> 29:33.313
- I guess.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.232
- Feeling better?

29:33.355 --> 29:35.232
- Sure.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.650
No, you're not.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.069
- You should get back to Yale.

29:36.692 --> 29:39.069
- Uh-uh.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.029
Rory, you can't just stay here.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.615
Sorry,

29:41.071 --> 29:42.615
I'm here for the duration.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.451
- No, uh, I'm fine.

29:42.656 --> 29:45.451
- You need supplies.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.245
There's no sign that you've

29:45.492 --> 29:48.245
eaten or had anything to drink.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.038
Well, I'm not hungry

29:48.287 --> 29:50.038
or thirsty.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.915
Well, If you're staying up here,

29:50.080 --> 29:51.915
you need supplies.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.668
- Sustenance, entertainment.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.668
- Nope.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.836
So, you're a little thirsty,

29:54.710 --> 29:56.836
aren't you?

29:56.878 --> 29:58.672
- A little.

29:56.878 --> 29:58.672
- What can I get you?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.633
- Water? Bourbon?

29:58.714 --> 30:00.633
- Water is good.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.468
- What do you got food-wise?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.468
- Not much.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.136
- What's not much?

30:02.509 --> 30:04.136
- Like, nothing.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.263
Some moldy bread.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.263
I've been eating out, mostly.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.391
- Okay. I'm going on a run.

30:06.305 --> 30:09.391
- 'I'm not hungry.'

30:09.433 --> 30:11.769
I'll get you some DVDs too.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.769
Do you want magazines?

30:11.810 --> 30:13.395
- No.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.395
- 'I'll get you some magazines.'

30:13.437 --> 30:14.688
You sure you don't want bourbon?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.022
Honey, you have stuff to do.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.275
This is my stuff.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.275
I'll be back in a flash.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.985
- The ribbons.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.985
- 'What?'

30:20.026 --> 30:22.571
Oh, the ribbons.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.571
They're all over town.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.740
I'll just ignore them.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.740
Stupid Taylor.

30:24.782 --> 30:26.866
People are gonna be

30:24.782 --> 30:26.866
all over you with questions.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.661
Then they'll feel the wrath

30:26.908 --> 30:28.661
of the green destiny.

30:28.702 --> 30:30.120
Oh, you'll get bombarded.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.414
Well, maybe I'll call in

30:30.162 --> 30:32.414
some reinforcements.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.082
- I got my cell on.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.082
- Okay.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.793
Okay, don't go

30:34.124 --> 30:35.793
rollerblading or bowling

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
or anything while I'm gone.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.378
I won't.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.428
(Frank)

30:45.302 --> 30:46.428
'I'll take those, miss.'

30:51.350 --> 30:53.226
- Did you get everything?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.226
- Everything on the list.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.894
Plus I threw in a few things

30:53.268 --> 30:54.894
of my own.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.896
Some Toll House cookie dough,

30:54.936 --> 30:56.896
cooked or uncooked.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.732
- The ultimate comfort food.

30:56.938 --> 30:58.732
- Nice.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.942
- Chocolate covered matzah.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.942
- Oh, nice and ethnic.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.069
- And a new toothbrush.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.069
- Why a new toothbrush?

31:03.111 --> 31:05.113
Dentists say you're suppose to

31:03.111 --> 31:05.113
change your toothbrush every

31:05.155 --> 31:07.366
three months and I'm assuming

31:05.155 --> 31:07.366
your mother's not doing that.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.075
Well, I'm not sure how that's

31:07.407 --> 31:09.075
going to help her depression

31:09.117 --> 31:11.119
but you are a good friend.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.538
You like ham and cheese, Frank?

31:12.579 --> 31:14.581
- Ah, thank you, miss.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.581
- We can head home now.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.333
(Frank)

31:14.623 --> 31:16.333
'Very good.'

31:16.375 --> 31:17.876
- Was Taylor in there?

31:16.375 --> 31:17.876
- Afraid so.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.753
- And he was holding court.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.753
- What?

31:19.795 --> 31:22.589
He was talking with a bunch

31:19.795 --> 31:22.589
of people about the break-up.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.591
- Big debate going on.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.591
- What debate?

31:24.633 --> 31:27.010
Oh, about whether Elm should

31:24.633 --> 31:27.010
have gone more pink than blue

31:27.052 --> 31:29.179
and whether Lorelai should

31:27.052 --> 31:29.179
have married that Max guy

31:29.221 --> 31:31.682
when she had the chance, oh,

31:29.221 --> 31:31.682
and he was passing out ribbons

31:31.724 --> 31:32.974
like there was no tomorrow.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.309
Was he?

31:34.351 --> 31:36.936
- Hold on, Frank.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.936
- 'Yes, ma'am.'

31:36.978 --> 31:39.356
Luke, I've known longer

31:36.978 --> 31:39.356
because of the diner.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.358
Lorelai is much later, but--

31:41.400 --> 31:43.109
- Where are they, Taylor?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.109
- What?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.987
Don't play dumb.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.987
The ribbons.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.574
Take piano lessons

31:46.029 --> 31:48.574
or something.

31:48.615 --> 31:51.451
Ah! She was so sweet

31:48.615 --> 31:51.451
when she was little.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.287
- Huh! Got 'em.

31:51.493 --> 31:54.287
- My compliments to your moxie.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.456
Oh, I've got moxie

31:54.329 --> 31:56.456
coming out of my ears today.

31:56.498 --> 31:58.250
[horn honking]

31:58.291 --> 32:01.169
- They honking at us?

31:58.291 --> 32:01.169
- They better not be.

32:01.211 --> 32:04.715
- Frank, are they honking at us?

32:01.211 --> 32:04.715
- 'I believe so.'

32:04.757 --> 32:09.135
Oh, I'm in no mood for this.

32:04.757 --> 32:09.135
We are depressed.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.597
We'll move when we move,

32:09.177 --> 32:11.597
so stop..

32:15.016 --> 32:17.102
Um, sorry.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.729
I'm not usually in a limo.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.527
[guitar music]

32:27.780 --> 32:30.574
Heads up. Man coming in.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.618
[gasps]

32:30.616 --> 32:32.618
The TV.

32:32.659 --> 32:35.036
If you won't come downstairs,

32:32.659 --> 32:35.036
I'm bringing downstairs to you.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.122
- On the table, Frank.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.122
- Very good. Evening, ma'am.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.917
- Evening.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.917
- That's Frank, my driver.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.502
So I put all the things

32:39.958 --> 32:42.502
you will definitely need

32:42.544 --> 32:45.213
within easiest reach,

32:42.544 --> 32:45.213
water, basic food stuffs.

32:45.255 --> 32:48.383
Then the things that you have

32:45.255 --> 32:48.383
to reach for or stand up for

32:48.425 --> 32:50.636
recede in order

32:48.425 --> 32:50.636
of frequency of use.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.387
It's not a science,

32:50.677 --> 32:52.387
but I did the best I could.

32:52.429 --> 32:55.432
Well, I'm-I'm loving

32:52.429 --> 32:55.432
this cereal combo.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.643
Five different kinds,

32:55.474 --> 32:57.643
three sweetened

32:57.684 --> 33:00.019
with a mix of non-fat milk

32:57.684 --> 33:00.019
and half-and-half.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.772
- It's a Paris recipe.

33:00.061 --> 33:01.772
- Thank her for me.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.189
- All done here.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.189
- 'Excellent.'

33:03.231 --> 33:04.441
Anything else I can get for you?

33:04.483 --> 33:05.901
I don't think so.

33:04.483 --> 33:05.901
Thanks, Frank.

33:05.943 --> 33:09.028
- Yeah, thanks, Frank.

33:05.943 --> 33:09.028
- Wait, who's Frank?

33:09.070 --> 33:10.739
Oh, well, I had to get out here

33:10.781 --> 33:14.033
and my car is at the dealer

33:10.781 --> 33:14.033
for its six month service.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.662
So my friend had a car

33:14.075 --> 33:16.662
and a driver standing by

33:16.703 --> 33:18.914
so they let me

33:16.703 --> 33:18.914
borrow it and Frank, and..

33:18.956 --> 33:20.123
Well, that explains Frank.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.500
You take your car to the dealer?

33:21.541 --> 33:23.042
- Yeah.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.042
- They're such a rip-off.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.753
It says in the book

33:23.084 --> 33:24.753
to take it to the dealer.

33:24.795 --> 33:27.046
If it said to drive off a cliff,

33:24.795 --> 33:27.046
would you drive off a cliff?

33:27.088 --> 33:29.633
- Yes, I would.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.633
- And they is a he?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.135
- Who?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.135
- The they with a limo.

33:32.177 --> 33:33.428
Yes, he's a he.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.388
- Thank Logan for me.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.388
- Okay.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.182
Look, you and Frank should go.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.017
- No.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.017
- Yale's gonna get mad.

33:39.058 --> 33:40.435
Yale's not gonna get mad.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.062
Rory, I'm glad you came,

33:40.477 --> 33:43.062
but look how fine I am.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.398
I'm surrounded by everything

33:43.104 --> 33:45.398
I could possibly need.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.775
I even have raw cookie dough,

33:45.440 --> 33:46.775
for God's sake.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.109
That was Lane's idea.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.863
A whole village has seen

33:48.151 --> 33:50.863
to my needs.

33:50.904 --> 33:53.323
Go. It's time. Look,

33:50.904 --> 33:53.323
I'm sitting up and everything.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.868
Then you're feeling better,

33:53.365 --> 33:55.868
I mean, for real this time?

33:55.909 --> 33:58.787
I'm not 100 percent,

33:55.909 --> 33:58.787
but I'm getting there. I swear.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.623
The downstairs is all set too.

33:58.829 --> 34:01.623
I cleaned up.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.375
Vacuumed a little,

34:01.665 --> 34:03.375
spot-dusted.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.585
- I've checked in with Sookie.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.585
- Oh, good.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.420
The party for the little girls

34:05.627 --> 34:07.420
and their dolls

34:07.462 --> 34:10.089
Michel, apparently really came

34:07.462 --> 34:10.089
through, and it was a big hit.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.509
- He sang a medley from "Annie."

34:10.131 --> 34:12.509
- Pulled out the big guns.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.052
- Good. Now go.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.052
- Okay,

34:14.093 --> 34:16.972
- But I am going to call a lot.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.972
- I'm good with that.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.891
And I only have

34:17.014 --> 34:18.891
one class tomorrow

34:18.932 --> 34:20.475
so I could stop by again

34:18.932 --> 34:20.475
in the afternoon.

34:20.517 --> 34:21.727
No, there will be no need.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.853
You can call me, too,

34:21.768 --> 34:22.853
you know.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.146
- I know, mom.

34:22.895 --> 34:25.146
- Okay. Bye.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.774
Bye, honey.

34:27.816 --> 34:29.902
And I'm gonna have Frank honk

34:27.816 --> 34:29.902
before we leave.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.110
- Why?

34:29.943 --> 34:31.110
- I don't know.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.946
- It just sounds fun.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.946
- Okay.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.537
Hey, Luke, it's me.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.624
I know I'm not

35:24.247 --> 35:25.624
supposed to be calling

35:25.665 --> 35:28.376
but I am not doing

35:25.665 --> 35:28.376
really great right now

35:28.418 --> 35:29.878
and..

35:31.838 --> 35:34.633
I was just wondering if..

35:34.674 --> 35:37.135
Do you remember

35:34.674 --> 35:37.135
in "The Way We Were"

35:37.176 --> 35:41.098
how Katie and Hubbell broke up

35:37.176 --> 35:41.098
because his friends were joking

35:41.139 --> 35:44.684
and laughing, and the president

35:41.139 --> 35:44.684
had just died, and..

35:44.726 --> 35:46.728
...she yelled at them,

35:44.726 --> 35:46.728
and he was mad

35:46.770 --> 35:50.356
and he was going out

35:46.770 --> 35:50.356
to Hollywood...and..

35:50.398 --> 35:54.527
I mean, which she hated

35:50.398 --> 35:54.527
and, and..

35:54.569 --> 35:58.573
...he broke up with her,

35:54.569 --> 35:58.573
and she was really..

35:58.615 --> 36:01.493
...upset,

35:58.615 --> 36:01.493
and she called him, and..

36:01.534 --> 36:03.453
...asked him if he would

36:01.534 --> 36:03.453
come over and sit with her

36:03.495 --> 36:07.833
because he was her best friend,

36:03.495 --> 36:07.833
and she needed her..

36:07.874 --> 36:10.585
...best friend,

36:07.874 --> 36:10.585
and he did.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.005
And..

36:13.046 --> 36:16.800
And...they talked all night.

36:16.842 --> 36:20.637
And they went out to Hollywood,

36:16.842 --> 36:20.637
which was a disaster

36:20.679 --> 36:27.102
but it was good at first

36:20.679 --> 36:27.102
with the boat and, uh..

36:27.144 --> 36:29.855
..and the...putting

36:27.144 --> 36:29.855
the books away.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.857
I've seen this movie a lot

36:29.896 --> 36:31.857
so if you don't remember

36:31.898 --> 36:34.317
the putting-the-books-away scene

36:31.898 --> 36:34.317
don't feel stupid or anything.

36:34.359 --> 36:38.697
I was just sitting here thinking

36:34.359 --> 36:38.697
about it because, I, um..

36:38.738 --> 36:42.909
...I'm in my house,

36:38.738 --> 36:42.909
and I was just, uh..

36:46.287 --> 36:47.914
[sobbing]

36:46.287 --> 36:47.914
Could you please come over?

36:47.956 --> 36:51.168
I, please, really

36:47.956 --> 36:51.168
need to see you and..

36:51.209 --> 36:54.295
[inhales sharply]

36:51.209 --> 36:54.295
...and talk to you and..

36:54.337 --> 36:57.049
...please come over.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.093
Please..

37:01.928 --> 37:03.555
...come..

37:07.893 --> 37:09.686
[inhales sharply]

37:07.893 --> 37:09.686
Oh, my God.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.774
[guitar music]

37:47.682 --> 37:49.017
[knock on door]

37:53.146 --> 37:54.564
- Hey, Ace. How you doing?

37:53.146 --> 37:54.564
- Fine.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.942
- Come on in.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.942
- Um, Logan, wait.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.318
No, I'm, I can't stay.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.318
I'm just returning Frank.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.279
- Returning Frank?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.279
- And the limo.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.240
- Thanks very much.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.240
- Everything okay back home?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.658
Okay enough.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.658
It was good that I went.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.035
Thank you very much

38:05.700 --> 38:07.035
for your help.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.954
- You're very formal tonight.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.954
- What?

38:08.995 --> 38:12.874
- Just your tone, it's formal.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.874
- Well, that's how it is.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.460
And I fed Frank a nice sandwich,

38:12.916 --> 38:15.460
so he's all good to go.

38:15.501 --> 38:17.170
You know, you ended up being

38:15.501 --> 38:17.170
extremely lucky for me, Ace.

38:17.212 --> 38:18.463
Is that so?

38:18.504 --> 38:19.714
I took Robert for everything

38:18.504 --> 38:19.714
he had plus

38:19.756 --> 38:21.049
everything I owed him

38:19.756 --> 38:21.049
from last time.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.634
I mean, you should come

38:21.091 --> 38:22.634
to all these things.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.344
- Yeah, kiddo, maybe I should.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.344
- What?

38:25.386 --> 38:27.388
Hey, did it ever occur to you

38:25.386 --> 38:27.388
when I called to ask you

38:27.430 --> 38:29.015
if you wanted to hang out

38:29.057 --> 38:30.725
that I meant that it should

38:29.057 --> 38:30.725
just be the two of us?

38:30.767 --> 38:32.393
I actually wasn't sure. The

38:30.767 --> 38:32.393
whole thing was a little vague.

38:32.435 --> 38:33.603
It wasn't vague.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.896
No, hang out

38:33.645 --> 38:34.896
is a little vague.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.648
It's not a specific

38:34.938 --> 38:36.648
boy-girl thing.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.650
Well, I can tell you that

38:36.689 --> 38:38.650
I wasn't expecting to be

38:38.691 --> 38:40.735
Fanny Brice

38:38.691 --> 38:40.735
to your Nicky Arnstein.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.487
But I already had this game

38:40.777 --> 38:42.487
going, and I couldn't just kick

38:42.528 --> 38:45.198
everybody out, so my choice was

38:42.528 --> 38:45.198
to say no and not see you at all

38:45.240 --> 38:46.741
or say yes,

38:45.240 --> 38:46.741
and do it the way we did it.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.660
Well, I wasn't

38:46.783 --> 38:48.660
expecting a group.

38:48.701 --> 38:51.246
So I should have said no?

38:48.701 --> 38:51.246
Meaning I wouldn't see you?

38:51.288 --> 38:52.622
- I wanted to see you.

38:51.288 --> 38:52.622
- Well, that's nice.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.166
I wanted to see you too,

38:52.664 --> 38:54.166
I just thought

38:54.207 --> 38:56.126
it would be

38:54.207 --> 38:56.126
a little more intimate.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.836
- Intimate?

38:56.168 --> 38:57.836
- You know what I mean.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.420
So the only time we can see

38:57.877 --> 38:59.420
each other is to have sex?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.797
No, Logan, that's not

38:59.462 --> 39:00.797
what I'm saying.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.423
That's what

39:00.839 --> 39:02.423
I'm taking from this.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.176
Well, don't take that.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.176
That's not what I'm saying.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.303
So we can see each other

39:04.217 --> 39:06.303
under all kinds of conditions.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.680
- Alone, in a group. Good.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.680
- Yeah.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.182
Last night happened

39:08.721 --> 39:10.182
to be a group thing.

39:10.223 --> 39:12.391
- Right.

39:10.223 --> 39:12.391
- So I don't see the problem.

39:12.433 --> 39:15.394
Yeah. No, I-I guess

39:12.433 --> 39:15.394
there really wasn't a problem.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.273
- I'm glad we cleared that up.

39:15.436 --> 39:18.273
- Yeah, me too.

39:18.315 --> 39:20.150
Now, I'm going out of town

39:18.315 --> 39:20.150
for a few days, but

39:20.192 --> 39:21.734
I was gonna give you a call

39:20.192 --> 39:21.734
to set something up

39:21.776 --> 39:23.195
for when I get back,

39:21.776 --> 39:23.195
but you called me first.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.363
- Right.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.363
- I'm back next Saturday.

39:25.404 --> 39:28.825
It's the first night I'm back.

39:25.404 --> 39:28.825
Want to, I don't know.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.328
What are kids saying these days?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.328
Hang out?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.788
I'm never listening to the

39:31.369 --> 39:33.788
breakfast-cereal girls again.

39:33.830 --> 39:37.167
- What?

39:33.830 --> 39:37.167
- Nothing. I'm free.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.669
- No group this time.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.420
Good. So next Saturday.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.886
- Thanks for feeding Frank.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.886
- You're welcome.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.512
And I promise not to call you

39:47.927 --> 39:49.512
kiddo again.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.848
I kind of picked up

39:49.554 --> 39:51.848
on that sarcasm from before.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.933
There are just so many

39:51.890 --> 39:53.933
other things you could call me.

39:53.975 --> 39:55.310
That's an opening.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.856
- Bye.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.856
- Bye, Ace.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.115
- Luke. Yeah.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.115
- Are you okay? You sure?

40:09.157 --> 40:11.034
I got here.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.034
There was no answer.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.037
[sighs]

40:11.076 --> 40:14.037
You got my message?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.122
Yeah, I was home

40:14.079 --> 40:16.122
and I couldn't reach the phone

40:16.164 --> 40:18.791
so I ran over here.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.791
I knocked, there was no answer.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.211
So I tried the loose window,

40:18.833 --> 40:21.211
but I fixed that last week

40:21.253 --> 40:23.462
and then I realized I fixed all

40:21.253 --> 40:23.462
the stupid ways there were

40:23.504 --> 40:25.715
to get into your house,

40:23.504 --> 40:25.715
and I broke the back door lock

40:25.757 --> 40:27.675
and I ran inside,

40:25.757 --> 40:27.675
and you weren't there.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.802
- Oh, my God.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.802
- It's okay. I can fix it.

40:29.844 --> 40:33.265
I'm so sorry, Luke. I will

40:29.844 --> 40:33.265
never do this to you ever again.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.934
I am absolutely humiliated.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.354
I was hurting, and I knew

40:35.975 --> 40:39.354
if I called you, you'd come.

40:39.396 --> 40:41.064
- I never should've done that.

40:39.396 --> 40:41.064
- It's okay.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.733
No, it's not okay. It's not

40:41.106 --> 40:43.733
okay. I am not that girl.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.985
I'm not the one

40:43.775 --> 40:45.985
who cries and falls apart

40:46.027 --> 40:51.741
and calls her ex-boyfriend

40:46.027 --> 40:51.741
to come and save her.

40:51.783 --> 40:56.037
Thank you so much for coming

40:51.783 --> 40:56.037
and for breaking my door.

40:56.079 --> 40:58.456
You're an amazing guy

40:56.079 --> 40:58.456
for doing that.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.083
What's that?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.461
It's the tape

41:01.542 --> 41:03.461

The last crazy thing you will

41:06.423 --> 41:09.550
ever have to endure

41:06.423 --> 41:09.550
from me, I promise.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.052
I just want you

41:09.592 --> 41:11.052
to know I heard you

41:11.094 --> 41:13.263
when you said that

41:11.094 --> 41:13.263
you're out, I did.

41:13.305 --> 41:16.641
I'm gonna respect that

41:13.305 --> 41:16.641
from now on.

41:18.684 --> 41:20.145
Okay.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.356
You should go.

41:20.186 --> 41:23.356
It's cold.

41:23.398 --> 41:24.816
I'll be fine.
