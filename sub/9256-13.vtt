00:02.040 --> 00:03.280
Previously on The Shield:

00:03.440 --> 00:08.320
- Got a double homicide in the Grove.
- It took you over an hour to show up.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.240
- Where's the police? Where are you?
- Someone leaked the 911 tapes.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.840
- Shit.
- We got a situation brewing.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.160
I know you're angry.
This is a serious problem.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.440
Wouldn't be no problem
in Beverly Hills.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.120
I was in a hit-and-run tonight.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.120
Tony!

00:27.280 --> 00:30.960
I go to check on him and his buddy
took shots at me. That's his buddy.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.640
- He shot at me.
- Good friends to have, Jesus.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.160
- Yeah, if I keep quiet.
- You call me anytime.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.520
- Jesus Christ! What did you do?
- Nothing you haven't done.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.400
When were you gonna tell me you're
shagging a Latina?

00:44.560 --> 00:46.720
- I didn't wanna get her involved.
- Who is she?

00:46.920 --> 00:50.240
- Sedona Tellez.
- Sedona Tellez is listed as a CEO...

00:50.400 --> 00:53.840
...of a corporation based in the Grand
Cayman Islands. Its sole purpose?

00:54.040 --> 00:56.040
Buying up real estate
here in Farmington.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.760
You've been manipulating police
resources to crash land value?

01:00.960 --> 01:04.599
Your mistress has been buying up
property in this area like Disney.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.120
- She never checked into the bungalow.
- Another lie?

01:07.280 --> 01:09.680
- Maybe he stashed her someplace else.
- Or slashed her.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.440
I'm gonna miss dinner tonight.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.320
- But Ben's already here.
- Gilroy's there?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.360
- What are you doing at my house?
- You should've left Sedona out of it.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.960
Pack bags for you and the kids.
You're not staying here.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.280
- What? This is our house.
- It isn't safe.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.840
The police department is ordering
you to disperse.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.040
The men are coming under
increased attack.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.760
It's time to pull back
or turn them loose.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.840
I wish I knew.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.280
Send them in.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.680
I'm getting reports of a casualty.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.160
Civilian. Female.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.160
Rescue standing by outside,
affirmative.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.160
- One Tango 13, respond.
- Connor and Adelaide.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.040
- One Tango 13 responding.
- One Tango 19 responding also.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.400
Hey, wait a minute. This is our call.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.960
It's a crazy night out here.
You might need backup.

03:06.360 --> 03:10.440
Hit the lights. Go around the park.
Don't let them beat us there.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.400
- Keep them comfortable and calm.
- You got it.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.600
- You mind sleeping on the couch?
- Hell, no. I've had worse.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.600
- Cool. Just lay low until I find Gilroy.
- Okay.

03:22.760 --> 03:25.520
- They're all asleep.
- Good.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.920
You wanna tell me
why my children are in danger?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.160
- They're not.
- Why are we living like refugees?

03:31.320 --> 03:33.720
- I have to find out a few things.
- I wanna go home.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.600
- We can't.
- Why not? What've you done?

03:35.760 --> 03:40.120
What are you mixed up in? This doesn't
happen to other cops' families.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.360
What are you doing that's worth
making us go into hiding?

03:43.680 --> 03:47.280
I just need the four of you to stay here.
All right?

03:53.640 --> 03:57.840
- We should've taken Caravelle.
- We'd still be at the park if you had.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.920
- Guess we'll never know.
- Hey, was that a false alarm or what?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.760
Oh, my God!

04:04.120 --> 04:08.640
Officer down! One Tango 13!
Officer down! Rudy!

04:08.840 --> 04:10.800
- Paula?
- He's dead.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.360
- What?
- Up.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.079
Come on.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.320
Come on.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.480
- Get down!
- There's more than one of them!

04:26.560 --> 04:28.200
Up there!

04:33.000 --> 04:34.640
They're gone.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.600
Paula.

04:39.960 --> 04:41.680
Paula.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.480
- What happened?
- Someone made a bogus 911 call.

05:02.640 --> 05:05.520
When the units responded,
they opened fire.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.120
Thanks, Chris.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.760
Who got hit?

05:11.920 --> 05:13.400
Rudy's dead.

05:13.560 --> 05:17.160
Paula's bad but has a chance. Danny
and Julien were there. They're okay.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.000
Is this because of the dead women
who got stood up by 911?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.200
- Yeah, looks like it.
- I want a shot at the SOB who did this.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.760
Get in line.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.280
Line starts here.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.520
Hey. How you doing?

05:30.840 --> 05:33.040
They killed him,
and Paula's really hurt.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.840
I know.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.880
We traced the 911 call to a cell phone.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.040
Who's it registered to?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.440
Police! On the ground, asshole!

05:49.840 --> 05:52.200
- Hey, hey, hold up.
- Don't move!

05:52.360 --> 05:54.080
Hey. All right. Nobody shoot, man!

05:54.360 --> 05:57.120
- Where's your cell phone?
- I don't know. Maybe I lost it.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.320
You hear about the cops
that got shot, Cyrus?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.720
- Your cell was used to lure them there.
- I say I lost my cell.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.680
Why don't you tell us for the third time
you got no idea how?

06:05.840 --> 06:07.960
Don't get all surly with me.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.960
Ain't a crime to lose your cell phone.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.560
Hey, Dutch. You still on top
of this hit-and-run thing?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.320
Yeah.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.600
Any luck on the whereabouts
of our driver's girlfriend?

06:21.760 --> 06:25.840
- You kept insisting it's a waste of time.
- What? You want me to say it?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.920
Maybe I was wrong. What do you got?

06:29.080 --> 06:32.040
Sedona Tellez used to work in
accounting for the department.

06:32.680 --> 06:35.280
- What, our department?
- Yeah. Down at headquarters.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.760
Two months into the job she's buying
up Farmington property with this...

06:38.920 --> 06:42.600
...Cayman Island shell company.
- Did you cut through the paper trail?

06:42.840 --> 06:46.080
All the land transactions went through
the same escrow company.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.240
- Did you talk to them?
- Without a warrant, they won't let me.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.440
How about letting me
take a shot at it?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.000
Really?

06:53.160 --> 06:56.880
I just wanna keep my fingers busy till
we find out if this guy's gonna crack.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.520
Gilroy's not at home or his office.
The guy's a goddamn ghost.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.280
- He's gotta be somewhere.
- Who knows where he'll be next?

07:04.440 --> 07:09.040
Your house again? My house?
We have to find him before he finds us.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.240
- Maybe he's hiding with the mistress.
- Oh, come on. He killed her.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.040
- We don't know that.
- He threatened your family.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.840
Brings up Terry dying.
He's taking his last breaths.

07:18.000 --> 07:21.360
Will you stop making threats
and start helping me find the guy?

07:21.520 --> 07:22.800
Now, dig in.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.040
When did we start catching guys
by diving into financial records?

07:26.200 --> 07:30.920
If Gilroy's gonna cash in on these
deals, he needs the girl's signature.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.240
When we find this Sedona,
we find him.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.880
Though I walk through
the midst of trouble...

07:38.040 --> 07:40.320
...your hand will revive me.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.400
- You will stretch out...
- Ready?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.880
- Sorry.
- It's all right. I'm...

07:50.240 --> 07:53.200
- You're shaking.
- No. I'm...

07:56.760 --> 07:59.240
Julien, look, it's okay to be scared.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.920
It is. I mean, you were almost
in a situation...

08:02.080 --> 08:04.520
I almost lost my partner last night.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.720
I'm just thankful.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.200
Yeah, me too.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.200
- This isn't the first phone you've lost.
- Excuse me?

08:18.360 --> 08:20.440
I've talked to seven
wireless companies.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.960
You've either had a phone lost or
cloned by each and every one of them.

08:24.120 --> 08:27.040
- Always on the first of the month.
- Bill time.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.840
You sell the phone to some grifter.
You wait a few days, report it missing.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.679
Meanwhile, half of Union Station
is calling up Guatemala.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.400
Or 911. That makes you
a felony accomplice.

08:37.559 --> 08:41.159
Wait a minute, man. All I could tell you
is who I sell the phones to.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.400
I wouldn't get mixed up
in no cop killings or nothing like that.

08:44.560 --> 08:47.120
I mean, you guys
are the real heroes out there, right?

08:47.280 --> 08:50.680
- Stop kissing ass and give us a name.
- His name is Igal.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.000
- He's one of those Jews.
- Those Jews?

08:53.200 --> 08:57.560
He's not American Jew. He's a real
Jew from Jerusalem or something.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.760
- There's been another 911 shooting.
- What?

08:59.960 --> 09:02.960
They got Patrick and Chris.
They're both dead.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.120
- You see that?
- They took his badge.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.200
Chris' too.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.240
Jesus.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.280
You know one of these vultures
saw something useful.

09:22.480 --> 09:24.360
Wanna try the smoke-out?

09:24.720 --> 09:26.080
Yeah.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.960
Excuse me. Detective Vendrell.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.880
Had reports someone
witnessed a crime or the perpetrator.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.600
- What report?
- There wasn't one.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.680
A woman was here when it
occurred. She didn't see the crime...

09:40.840 --> 09:44.400
...but she did see another witness.
She's gonna be here in a few minutes...

09:44.560 --> 09:47.600
...to identify you, so you may as well
come forward right now.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.440
You, stop! Stop right there!

09:54.440 --> 09:56.000
Stop!

09:58.400 --> 10:00.480
Don't make me shoot you, asshole!

10:03.440 --> 10:05.040
Stop!

10:10.480 --> 10:13.400
- All right, you start talking!
- I didn't do nothing, man.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.840
All right. Fine.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.440
You're not a witness, then you're
an arrest, and this is just enough...

10:19.600 --> 10:21.840
...to make you a trafficker.
- You can't do that.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.440
What? Bust drug dealers?
You just made my quota for the week.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.680
- Come on!
- Okay, look, man, I'll tell you.

10:27.840 --> 10:31.720
- You just gotta get that rock off me.
- The whole truth first.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.400
All right, look. I heard shots, man.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.120
I see two cops go down, then someone
go over and mess with the body.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.160
- Who?
- There's three of them, man.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.680
- Blacks?
- Yeah. Two brothers and a sister, man.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.920
Now, can you take the dope with you?
Please, man. Come on, man.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.720
Have them secure the areas
before going in.

10:48.880 --> 10:51.400
- Our artist just finished.
- How many copies did you run?

10:51.560 --> 10:53.160
- Five thousand.
- Make it 10.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.640
I'll talk to my contacts on the street.
Someone's gotta know these guys.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.560
No one talks to the press but me.

10:58.760 --> 11:02.480
I want every off-duty officer scrambled
and in this building within 45 minutes.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.400
Wagenbach, why are you
sitting there?

11:04.560 --> 11:05.880
I'm working a hit-and-run.

11:06.040 --> 11:10.080
Well, stop. We got cops bleeding in
the streets. Half the district's on fire.

11:10.240 --> 11:13.360
There's no other case. You and
Claudette will run the investigation.

11:13.520 --> 11:16.120
- I was handling this personally.
- Not anymore.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.320
Are you shitting me with this?

11:22.160 --> 11:25.240
You had command of the riot squad
and a lady got trampled to death.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.920
The shootings last night, I stayed out
of it, and now I got two more dead.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.920
- I can't afford your leadership now.
- We're making progress.

11:32.080 --> 11:35.440
Not enough. If you wanna cry
to the chief, give him a call.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.480
But do it downstairs, because
I'm taking over your office.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.400
Pete, I need the case file,
duty roster...

11:42.560 --> 11:44.840
...and a cup of coffee,
not too much cream.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.360
Pete, could you wait for a minute
outside, please?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.560
Stay close in case
I need you, though.

11:58.680 --> 12:01.560
- What do you want, Vic?
- You threatened my family.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.920
If I wanted to hurt them, I could've.

12:04.080 --> 12:07.840
You kept digging into Sedona and our
land deals. I was just refocusing you.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.840
You know what you did.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.320
- You know what I'm gonna have to do.
- You're not doing anything.

12:13.520 --> 12:16.200
Not now. But soon.

12:16.440 --> 12:19.400
You think I'd take you on
without insurance?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.400
Trust me, I got something on you.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.360
You bastard.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.640
You hit that kid,
come begging to me for help?

12:31.520 --> 12:34.880
- Call me friend?
- Stop chasing after me and Sedona.

12:35.080 --> 12:38.360
Do what you do best.
Find these cop killers.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.080
Okay, friend?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.360
Pete!

12:47.320 --> 12:48.840
Get me Donald Graham
on the phone.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.240
I wanna get some of the Southside
boys here until we catch these pricks.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.560
That's all for now.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.320
Gilroy's really got you spinning, huh?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.560
I mean, blame this whole mess
on you and then yank you off it.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.800
We get these guys, he's the hero.
Either way, you're the goat.

13:22.960 --> 13:26.400
Guess you can kiss that City Council
seat goodbye.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.640
- You here to pile on?
- No. I'm here to help.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.720
What if I told you there was a way to
flip things around, make you the hero?

13:37.320 --> 13:39.880
Maybe even put your
political career on track.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.400
- How?
- Help me take down a dirty cop.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.080
Gilroy diverted police units from
that part of town so crime would rise...

13:50.240 --> 13:52.160
...and he could buy property
at a discount?

13:52.320 --> 13:56.680
Led to the murder of those two women,
the riots, the cop shootings.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.040
When he killed that kid
in the hit-and-run with his mistress...

14:00.200 --> 14:01.640
...he was afraid it'd get out.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.440
If that's true, why don't you
go upstairs and arrest him?

14:04.600 --> 14:06.040
Because I can't prove it.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.080
This land deal is a paper-trail
nightmare. I can't begin to crack it.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.800
Your smarts, you could.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.720
You're flattering me,
so this must be a setup.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.280
It's not.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.120
- Gilroy's bad.
- You can't get him on the hit-and-run?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.640
He had the car fixed.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.720
And one of the witnesses
was already killed in a gang hit.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.080
What about the woman in the car?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.920
Sedona Tellez.

14:31.080 --> 14:35.280
Gilroy's mistress is the key. Find her,
she can give him up for the land deal...

14:35.440 --> 14:37.440
...and the hit-and-run.
- Find her yourself.

14:37.600 --> 14:41.360
- Gilroy wants me out on the street.
- And why should I do all your legwork?

14:42.000 --> 14:44.320
Because when I find
these cop shooters...

14:44.480 --> 14:46.520
...I'll let you bring them in.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.440
That way you get the credit
for taking down Gilroy and them.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.200
Sounds like a nice headline to me.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.880
A little too nice. I don't know
what trap you've set...

14:55.040 --> 14:57.520
I don't expect you to trust me.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.880
But I know you're too curious...

15:01.120 --> 15:03.280
...not to check in on it.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.160
Trying to put AT&T
out of business, Igal?

15:10.320 --> 15:12.560
No. I'm just trying to get by.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.720
Each and every one of these phones
is either stolen or cloned.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.240
I am as shocked as you are
to discover that.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.440
I bet. Did you sell phones
to any of these kids?

15:22.440 --> 15:25.720
- I don't know. What did they do?
- They killed three police officers...

15:25.880 --> 15:29.000
...and put the fourth in a hospital.
- What? No.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.600
- These are them?
- Yeah.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.000
And they used your phones
to lure them there.

15:35.160 --> 15:39.320
- No. This is horrible. I have no idea.
- So you did sell phones to them?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.960
One each. Yesterday.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.040
Please, tell me how I can help
you to catch these monsters.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.640
- Give us the numbers of the phones.
- Of course, of course.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.040
Now.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.200
We were at Patrick's kid's party
weeks ago.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.800
- I know.
- Jesus!

15:54.960 --> 15:58.960
Let's hit south of Olympic. I'm giving
a reward to whoever ID's these three.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.520
- How're my kids?
- Good. I rented them a PlayStation.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.120
- Thanks.
- Hey, call Corrine. She's not thrilled.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.000
- Okay. Call me if you find out anything.
- All right. Let's get them! Come on.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.240
- Hey, it's me.
- When are we going home?

16:12.440 --> 16:15.560
- I don't know. Hopefully a day or two.
- Day or two? Are you okay?

16:15.720 --> 16:18.040
- Yes.
- Then what's going on?

16:18.200 --> 16:21.920
I got things coming at me from every
direction. I don't need more problems.

16:22.080 --> 16:26.200
What's happening to this family is the
problem, and you won't tell me why.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.680
Just do nothing.

16:27.840 --> 16:31.520
That's all I'm asking you to do. Just sit
there and do nothing. Is that so hard?

16:31.720 --> 16:35.080
- I'm not your prisoner.
- Look, I'll tell you when it's safe.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.000
Don't bother.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.880
What's up, dog?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.600
Tio! You're out early.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.880
People's nerves are shot.
They need an escape.

17:04.040 --> 17:09.040
Yeah, well, killing brain cells is fine.
Killing cops ain't. Let's go. Showtime.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.400
Know anything about
these 911 shootings?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.960
A lot of people think the cops
had it coming.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.280
- I say we need to work with the police.
- I'm glad you feel that way.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.440
- I need a line on these guys.
- I hear anything...

17:19.599 --> 17:22.680
Not good enough. You're gonna
go out looking, be my eyes and ears.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.160
Something happens,
you'll be my feet and hands too.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.720
You'll have to get
off your corner and get involved.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.240
- Shitheads sometimes brag about this.
- They do, we need to know.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.760
- I'll get involved, see who's talking.
- You do that.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.360
Yes. I wanted information on some
escrow accounts at your company.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.080
Well, who can release
that information?

17:47.240 --> 17:50.480
Good. Now, call him at home and tell
him that Capt. David Aceveda's...

17:50.640 --> 17:53.640
...about to show up there
with 10 officers and a subpoena...

17:53.800 --> 17:56.800
...if he isn't on the phone with me
in about 30 seconds.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.200
- Yes, I'll hold.
- You got a minute, David?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.400
- Yes, sir.
- Listen...

18:02.560 --> 18:04.560
...I'm sorry if I was hard
on you earlier.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.440
- Nerves get a bit raw at a time like this.
- Yes, they do.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.560
And I know how bent up you are
about being pushed aside here...

18:10.720 --> 18:13.600
...but I got something that might
help take the pain away.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.760
Really?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.480
You've always tried to warn me
about Vic.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.040
But until recently,
I figured he meant well.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.360
- Now I'm not so sure.
- What are you talking about?

18:24.520 --> 18:27.320
There was a dead kid the other day.
Jesus something.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.840
It got written down as a gang hit.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.760
I've got a source, though,
says it was Mackey.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.240
- What?
- I know how badly you've wanted him.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.160
And he has a lot of friends
who don't wanna see him hang.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.240
You're the only one
I can trust with this.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.080
Get down!

18:50.400 --> 18:52.480
Lock down the building!

19:16.440 --> 19:17.720
- Hands up!
- Freeze!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.800
Let's see some hands!
See some hands!

19:21.280 --> 19:24.160
- Throw your weapons outside the car!
- You're just gonna kill us.

19:24.320 --> 19:29.120
- I got a clean shot, captain.
- No. No shots until I give the word.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.360
Copycats?

19:58.560 --> 20:01.320
They're Latino, not blacks.
Everyone in the neighbourhood...

20:01.480 --> 20:03.360
...feels like they can take a
free shot now.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.560
Nice job.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.440
That thing we were talking about.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.760
- You interested?
- Mackey?

20:10.920 --> 20:13.400
- Very.
- Good.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.280
Let's talk.

20:19.800 --> 20:22.920
Heard about some punk flashing
a cop's badge like it was a souvenir.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.200
Talking about how he started shooting
and the cops ran like bitches.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.320
- Know where this asshole lives?
- His old man's a heavy biter.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.040
- All loused up.
- Great.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.680
Dad's busy mainlining
and junior's a cop killer.

20:33.840 --> 20:37.040
I doubt Mom's Betty Crocker.
Thanks for the fast info.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.240
Police!

20:57.400 --> 20:59.000
Don't move!

21:03.160 --> 21:05.800
- Jesus Christ!
- What do you guys want?

21:06.000 --> 21:09.520
- We're looking for your boy.
- Sonny? He ain't here.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.120
- Where's your kid?
- I don't know.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.720
Well, you better remember, or you're
gonna be visiting Jonestown.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.320
In a brightly lit, cold cage.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.800
I can get my boy down here,
but, like, what's in it for me?

21:29.520 --> 21:32.240
I still got one vein working.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.400
How much do you need, porcupine?

21:39.800 --> 21:43.840
<i>Two Tango 13, 911 call.
Woman caller reports she's dying.</i>

21:44.000 --> 21:45.560
8811 Lorraine.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.480
That's three blocks from last night.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.040
- Got yours on?
- Absolutely.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.800
All right.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.880
You call for the police?

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
In here!

22:26.040 --> 22:28.000
Police in the house.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.560
You got here!

22:31.280 --> 22:32.640
What's wrong, ma'am?

22:32.800 --> 22:35.720
Well, my daughter left
and I need to take my medicine.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.520
- What medicine?
- For arthritis. It's over there.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.920
You called us for your
arthritis medicine?

22:41.080 --> 22:44.080
In the brown bottle over there.
Hand it to me.

22:45.680 --> 22:50.200
- Ma'am, 911 is for emergencies.
- Well, this is emergency to me.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.400
- How many?
- Two.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.720
- What?
- Would it kill you to get me water?

23:07.480 --> 23:10.480
Hey, boy. Where you at?

23:11.680 --> 23:13.320
Mama's here.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.600
Yeah. She got Jesus now.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.160
She looks good.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.720
She can't wait to see you.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.360
Okay. All right, son.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.800
He's on his way.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.040
Yes sir...

23:44.000 --> 23:47.680
One of the phones Igal sold just got
used to call an apartment in the Grove.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.680
- Yes. Here we go.
- Okay, roll.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.600
Mama?

23:58.320 --> 24:00.080
What are you...?

24:02.720 --> 24:04.880
Sorry, sonny. I ain't your mama.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.680
Look what we got here.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.960
Looks nice.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.600
This what you used to kill my friends?

24:25.320 --> 24:28.520
Oh, you cop-killing piece of shit!

24:29.960 --> 24:32.760
- Who are the other shooters?
- Kiss my ass, man.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.400
I can't tell you how much I was hoping
that's what your answer would be.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.200
You wanna kill me, sonny?

25:01.440 --> 25:03.360
Wanna kill me?

25:08.640 --> 25:11.040
- Who are the other shooters?
- Dad!

25:11.600 --> 25:15.040
- Sorry.
- What are their names?

25:16.920 --> 25:20.080
- Benji and Twanya.
- Where can I find them?

25:20.640 --> 25:23.760
We were gonna find some abandoned
building to squat in.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.800
What part of town?

25:26.320 --> 25:28.560
Near the Groves.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.520
- Police! Search warrant!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.200
- Whoa, it's just us!
- We already got him.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.080
What do we got?

25:49.280 --> 25:53.120
- He's one of our cop killers.
- He was stabbing me with that badge.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.600
Asshole.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.040
You look fine to me.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.080
I'm listening.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.960
First you want me to shut up,
now you want me to talk?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.840
How many personalities
you got, lady?

26:21.000 --> 26:23.520
Walking around
pretending to be a man.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.520
- I know what you really are.
- You don't know nothing.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.040
I know that leg's shaking.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.040
Why'd you do it?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.200
Three officers dead.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.320
How many more lives
you plan on ruining?

26:38.080 --> 26:39.800
More the merrier.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.520
Bang.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.960
It is...

26:46.560 --> 26:48.600
...everything in me...

26:48.800 --> 26:51.880
...not to slap you silly.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.400
- Come on.
- No freebies, girl. Now, step off.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.480
- Screw your mother in the ass, Tio.
- Already did twice this morning, bitch.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.240
- Tio, I need another favour.
- You're as bad as her.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.440
- How much money you got?
- A few thou.

27:06.640 --> 27:10.000
Give it to me. I gotta grease a few
wheels. I left my play money at home.

27:10.160 --> 27:12.640
- Come on.
- Can't say I ain't paying my dues.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.560
No, I can't.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.520
Talk to every Boxcar Willie
and bag lady you see.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.560
If our shooters are squatting,
I wanna know where.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.720
- Looks like it'll be raining Jim Beam.
- Make it Thunderbird, it'll go farther.

27:25.800 --> 27:28.760
I'm Sedona Tellez. I heard
there's a problem with the closing...

27:28.920 --> 27:31.680
...on one of my properties.
- Actually, there's not.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.480
Sedona.
I'm Capt. David Aceveda.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.560
- Have we met before?
- No.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.520
But I've got lots of questions.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.600
Very nice. Quite a step up
from your place in Farmington.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.280
I've done well lately.

27:46.520 --> 27:48.880
Thanks to your corporation
in the Caymans.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.200
That's quite the shell game.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.480
If you were going to arrest me,
you would've taken me in.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.560
Not back to my place.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.160
Sure you don't want a drink?

27:58.320 --> 28:02.200
How does it work,
this land scheme of yours?

28:02.680 --> 28:06.160
I speculate real estate. It's no scheme
and it's not against the law.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.960
Unless your boyfriend keeps police
resources from there...

28:09.120 --> 28:11.520
...so it stays a slum,
so you could buy it cheap.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.320
Boyfriend?

28:13.480 --> 28:16.600
Then he pours resources back in,
cleans it up and...

28:16.760 --> 28:19.600
...you get to sell your properties
for a killing.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.800
Wow, I should've thought of that.

28:22.720 --> 28:27.160
I'm sure you did.
Seems a bit complicated for Gilroy.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.360
I don't know a Gilroy.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.920
You worked in his office for two
months. I bet you showed him...

28:33.080 --> 28:37.280
...how to park pension funds into your
account to make your purchases.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.720
Yeah.
I made a few calls this afternoon.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.720
Now, let's talk about
your boyfriend's hit-and-run.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.080
- I understand your anger.
- You don't know me.

28:50.280 --> 28:53.800
Your father's a heroin addict,
your mother left when you were 9.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.560
Am I missing
any of the broad strokes?

28:59.000 --> 29:01.720
The two women who were murdered
across the street from you.

29:01.880 --> 29:03.520
Did you know them?

29:03.800 --> 29:06.840
- Saw them sometimes.
- Is that what this is all about?

29:08.040 --> 29:09.800
Revenge?

29:09.960 --> 29:12.200
- No, no.
- What, then? Just for kicks?

29:12.560 --> 29:13.960
Deal with it.

29:14.160 --> 29:16.480
You murdered three of my people.

29:22.560 --> 29:25.920
Twanya knew the women good.
They looked after her.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.120
Benji and me figured the three of us
should do something about it.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.960
The police didn't kill those women.
Wally Forton did.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.440
They called 911.

29:33.800 --> 29:37.440
- You all took an hour to show up.
- So you kill three people?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.040
Just cops.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.800
Just like you all killed those ladies.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.960
I don't care how right
you think you are.

29:45.120 --> 29:50.240
I don't care what kind of bad life
you had. What you did was wrong.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.280
It's as wrong as it gets.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.480
Vic, this is Sedona Tellez.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.080
- I've been looking for you.
- I've been right here.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.440
She has a lot of interesting things
to say about our assistant chief.

30:06.600 --> 30:08.280
So much for loyalty, huh, lady?

30:08.480 --> 30:11.760
Ben's in love. I have a future.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.680
Gilroy's not the only one
she implicates.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.360
- Meaning?
- Meaning I was wondering...

30:20.520 --> 30:22.400
...what your trap was and now I know.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.920
You didn't think I'd find out
about the murder?

30:25.080 --> 30:27.240
- What murder?
- Jesus Rosales.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.280
The witness to Gilroy's hit-and-run.

30:29.840 --> 30:31.880
- That was a gang hit.
- Are you in a gang now?

30:32.040 --> 30:34.000
What, is she saying I killed Jesus?

30:34.160 --> 30:37.480
She says a cop buddy cleaned it all up
for Gilroy. I wonder who that is.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.720
- Not me.
- You wanted me to take down Gilroy...

30:39.880 --> 30:42.680
...before he could take you down.
You're both filthy in this.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.920
Hey, I had nothing to do
with killing that Rosales kid.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.520
So if I checked out your place
I wouldn't find the murder weapon.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.040
- No way in hell.
- All right. Let's find out.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.760
This is a search warrant
for your place.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.480
Gilroy thinks we'll find something.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.600
Ben...

31:04.200 --> 31:08.480
Ben was at my house yesterday.
I thought he was there...

31:08.640 --> 31:10.280
He must've planted the gun there.

31:10.720 --> 31:15.040
And why would Gilroy have a murder
weapon to an unsolved gang hit?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
Because he killed Jesus.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.440
- Oh, you are just full of surprises.
- I was in the room when he did it.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.520
I found him. If I said anything,
it would've looked liked I was in on it.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.120
And we all know
how squeaky clean you are.

31:33.720 --> 31:36.960
- Gilroy had you get this warrant?
- That's right.

31:42.680 --> 31:46.280
This warrant is six hours old.
You haven't searched my house?

31:47.200 --> 31:50.120
I talked Gilroy into letting you
catch these cop killers first.

31:50.280 --> 31:52.400
And then we're moving on you.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.960
Yeah.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.320
Hold on, hold on.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.480
Okay, I got it.

32:08.040 --> 32:09.640
Good.

32:10.280 --> 32:11.880
That was Lem.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.480
They know where
the other two shooters are.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.480
Now...

32:18.800 --> 32:21.120
...are you gonna help
Gilroy frame me?

32:21.280 --> 32:24.280
Or are you gonna go with me
and nail these bastards?

32:28.720 --> 32:30.040
You sure the shooter's inside?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.760
- Thunderbird did the trick.
- Couple squatters ID'd them.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.600
Said the guy told them to get lost,
waved a gun around.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.360
Good.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.960
Now, stay close.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.840
I know what I'm doing.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.200
All right, ladies.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.480
They wanna come peacefully, fine.

32:51.640 --> 32:55.880
If not, they killed Rudy,
Patrick and Chris.

33:22.480 --> 33:25.920
I ain't about the romance
I'm all about the finance

33:58.280 --> 34:01.280
Hey, asshole.
One more inch and you're dead!

34:01.440 --> 34:03.800
Now, put your hands on your head!

34:03.960 --> 34:05.240
Okay.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.960
Okay, it's cool. It's cool, it's cool.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.120
Vic!

34:11.880 --> 34:15.000
Don't! Get down on your knees!
Get down!

34:16.360 --> 34:18.600
Hands on your head!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

34:19.000 --> 34:22.280
- Everyone all right?
- Yeah. We got it.

34:40.199 --> 34:42.040
Great work, David.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.080
You got that warrant for Vic's place?

34:47.320 --> 34:48.880
Right here.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.960
You ready to serve it?

34:51.280 --> 34:54.520
He caught three cop killers, cleaned
up your mess, and you can just...

34:54.679 --> 34:56.800
...stab him in the back.
- My mess?

34:56.960 --> 34:59.200
I practically choked
digging through the shit.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.360
- Mackey's just covering his ass.
- The land schemes? The hit-and-run?

35:03.520 --> 35:06.280
You gonna try laying those
at his door too?

35:07.320 --> 35:11.080
Don't come near this, David.
Especially without any proof.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.080
Everyone's gonna know
what you did.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.800
Last time.
Don't play with fire.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.160
Get out of my office.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.600
If you won't serve this,
I'll find someone who will.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.520
You're fired.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.080
- Anything?
- No.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.080
Check the den again.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.600
- Nothing in Matthew's room.
- Check the garage.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.800
This gun is nowhere.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.400
- I found it!
- What?

35:48.560 --> 35:50.840
- I found it! I found it.
- Where'd you find it?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.960
It was in the central air vent
in Cassidy's room.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.440
Still loaded.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.800
Sedona!

35:58.240 --> 36:00.200
Come on, we gotta go!

36:03.840 --> 36:05.680
Hi, Ben.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.760
I figured you'd be at your place.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.840
Looking for this, right?

36:16.480 --> 36:18.280
Sit down, you prick.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.040
It was just some insurance, Vic.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.120
Yeah?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.360
You should've taken out
life insurance.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.040
Vic, please.

36:33.240 --> 36:37.240
You planted a murder weapon
in my house.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.040
A loaded gun in my little girl's room.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.880
- She wouldn't have found it.
- I found it.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.800
- Oh, you are so over, man.
- Vic...

36:46.120 --> 36:48.360
I'm really sorry about all this.
I mean...

36:48.520 --> 36:51.160
...there's a way out.
- Shut up, you goddamn drunk!

36:51.680 --> 36:54.440
Vic, just drop me and Sedona
off across the border.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.160
We got some money. We'll disappear.
You'll never hear from me again.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.680
I can't let you walk away
from this, Ben.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.240
I'd be giving up my job, my life.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.200
We got a different price tag
in mind.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.200
Oh, yeah?

37:09.680 --> 37:11.560
- Then kill me!
- You damn right.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.680
Well, come on already!

37:15.760 --> 37:17.960
Just kill me, Vic. Go ahead.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.560
But don't act like you're
better than me.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.080
What things have you done?

37:22.240 --> 37:25.240
What've you done,
then covered those things up?

37:32.360 --> 37:36.000
- I'm not like you.
- Not yet.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.760
Not ever.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.520
If you really believe that,
pull the goddamn trigger!

37:45.360 --> 37:46.960
Do it, man.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.360
Come on, it's time, man. Do it.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.160
Well, you're such a saint.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.320
Pull the trigger.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.360
Look, it's all right, man.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.360
It's all right. You two got history.
It's not easy.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.080
Okay?

38:05.680 --> 38:09.880
All right. Let me do it.
Let me do this for you, Vic.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.440
Please, Vic.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.160
Looks like it's starting to work.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.760
Us.

38:52.240 --> 38:54.040
Yeah.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.320
Of course, you never ask me
about my stuff.

38:57.480 --> 39:02.040
I'm always trying to get you to open
up, but you never pry. Why is that?

39:03.120 --> 39:04.960
You wanna talk?

39:05.120 --> 39:07.000
We will.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.320
I'll wait outside,
we'll walk out together?

39:10.520 --> 39:11.920
Sure.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.280
Boss, went by the hotel.
Your family's gone, man.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.360
- What?
- They're gone!

40:16.320 --> 40:19.240
Two of the shooters have been
detained, the other is dead.

40:19.520 --> 40:23.480
Captain, can you comment on the
arrest of Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy?

40:23.640 --> 40:26.600
The facts will show that
Assistant Chief Gilroy chose a path...

40:26.760 --> 40:29.400
...that led to tragic circumstances
for the city.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.200
Corrine!

40:34.280 --> 40:35.920
Cassidy!

41:02.720 --> 41:07.200
It's me. I'm really tired.
I don't know where we're going, but...

41:07.360 --> 41:11.520
<i>I know you'll
wanna find us, but...</i>

41:12.120 --> 41:15.680
<i>... if you still have love for me,
you won't try...</i>

41:15.880 --> 41:17.960
... for a while, anyway.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.280
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

41:27.560 --> 41:30.320
I can't comment at this time
until we have more information.

41:30.480 --> 41:33.200
- One more follow-up question.
- There you are.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.560
- I'm a sucker for a good show.
- Well, for us the show's over.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.120
Husband shot his wife
because she lost his car keys.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.000
He's already in custody. Wanna
pick up some food on the way?

41:42.160 --> 41:44.440
Are you dragging me to that
Chinese place again?

41:44.600 --> 41:47.680
- I got a thing for egg rolls tonight.
- You got it every night.

41:47.840 --> 41:51.120
How about spareribs, roast beef,
anything else?

42:04.360 --> 42:05.960
Oh, no.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.520
Oh, that's okay. Okay.

42:13.800 --> 42:16.520
Oh, God!

42:17.480 --> 42:19.960
Goddamn it!

42:20.120 --> 42:24.400
Do these arrests put you in the front-
running for the City Council elections?

42:24.560 --> 42:27.800
In my experience, people hate being
told who to vote for. I wouldn't...

42:27.960 --> 42:32.600
...declare me the winner quite yet. I've
enjoyed my underdog status up to now.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.200
No...

42:44.760 --> 42:47.160
But today's events can't hurt, right?

42:47.320 --> 42:49.800
Let's focus on what today's events
really mean.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.840
Three officers gave their lives
in defence of an institution...

42:53.000 --> 42:55.280
...that their boss betrayed
for personal gain.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.800
It's a scandal and an outrage.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.120
The curse of corruption
has left its mark on this department.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.880
Now we start the difficult task
of healing.
