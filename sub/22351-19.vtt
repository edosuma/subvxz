00:01.990 --> 00:07.990
>> Previously on "Big Brother":
With the house divided an epic

00:07.990 --> 00:12.830
battle of endurance began.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.990
And after two hours of
outlasting everyone else, Shelli

00:16.990 --> 00:20.990
made a deal with James to keep
herself and Clay safe.

00:20.990 --> 00:24.990
>> No backdoor, no nomination
for me or.

00:24.990 --> 00:25.990
>> I promise.

00:25.990 --> 00:28.990
This is "Big Brother" and the
words of the boogie.

00:28.990 --> 00:30.990
You can bounce checks up in this
house.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.990
>> So James became the king of
the Mountain.

00:32.990 --> 00:36.990
>> Rut new head of household.

00:36.990 --> 00:40.990
>> And the 6th sense
alliance scattered.

00:40.990 --> 00:43.990
>> Like, we're at a really bad
point right now.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.990
>> The last person we wanted to
win was James.

00:45.990 --> 00:49.990
>> Wanting to make a big move,
James considered going after the

00:49.990 --> 00:50.950
golden couple.

00:50.950 --> 00:52.000
>> Basically, what they did to
us--

00:52.000 --> 00:52.990
>> we're doing to them.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.000
>> We're going to do to them.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.990
>> I love it.

00:55.990 --> 01:04.700
>> When Becky reported the news
to Clay and Shelli...... they

01:04.700 --> 01:06.990
tried to throw Austin under the
bus instead.

01:06.990 --> 01:11.950
>> Who do you think started this
whole role to save Austin and

01:11.950 --> 01:14.000
put somebody else on the block?

01:14.000 --> 01:14.990
Austin!

01:14.990 --> 01:17.990
>> But James was determined to
go for blood.

01:17.990 --> 01:21.990
>> Nom nay day is going to hit
them like a mack truck.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.990
>> And at the nomination
ceremony--

01:23.990 --> 01:26.990
>> I have nominated you, Clay,
and you, Shelli.

01:26.990 --> 01:27.990
>> He broke his deal.

01:27.990 --> 01:32.990
>> You did publicly in front of
this entire house make a deal

01:32.990 --> 01:36.990
with me, so nerch this house can
know right now that James is not

01:36.990 --> 01:37.990
good for his word.

01:37.990 --> 01:39.990
>> His word is ( Bleep ).

01:39.990 --> 01:43.990
>> Tonight, can the power of
veto save the showmance or will

01:43.990 --> 01:47.990
clellie's love be torn apart?

01:47.990 --> 01:56.290
Find out right now on "big
brother."

01:56.290 --> 01:59.990
Captioning funded by CBS
>> ever since day one, h.O.H. I

02:44.290 --> 02:45.990
was known as a heavy hitter.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.540
I'm not scared to get blood on
my hand.

02:48.540 --> 02:49.990
That's what I signed up for.

02:49.990 --> 02:54.830
Clay and Shelli are are up on
the block for a reason and I'm

02:54.830 --> 02:58.990
not scared to be the one to say
I dropped the hammer on them.

02:58.990 --> 03:01.990
>> You know, this whole game,
there's always a fear of being

03:01.990 --> 03:04.990
put up on block next to Shelli.

03:04.990 --> 03:07.990
I just never thought someone
like James could go back on his

03:07.990 --> 03:08.120
word.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.990
And for that to happen, that's
probably the most frustrating

03:11.990 --> 03:12.540
part.

03:12.540 --> 03:12.990
We'll be all right.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.830
>> I am up on the block with the
number one person in this house

03:16.830 --> 03:21.990
that means more to me than
anything.

03:21.990 --> 03:29.990
I just can't even imagine being
here playing this game without

03:29.990 --> 03:33.410
my right or die, without my
rock.

03:33.410 --> 03:35.990
How am I going to move forward
in this game separated from

03:35.990 --> 03:40.990
Clay?

03:40.990 --> 03:42.990
>> Shelli, don't worry about it.

03:42.990 --> 03:45.830
>> You're the only person I want
to be with right now.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.990
I don't want anyone to come talk
to us.

03:47.990 --> 03:56.990
>> Listen, I want you to know
I'm loyal to the end and-- why

03:56.990 --> 03:59.990
is he acting like meas ( Bleep )
At me?

03:59.990 --> 04:05.990
I didn't do anything.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.990
You talk about integrity and
your word.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.000
>> Clay!

04:09.000 --> 04:10.990
>> Your word is nothing to me.

04:10.990 --> 04:11.990
>> Clay!

04:11.990 --> 04:11.990
No, stop it.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.000
>> Dude, whatever man.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.990
That's why you're up for
eviction now.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.990
>> Stop it, Clay.

04:16.990 --> 04:17.990
>> You're right.

04:17.990 --> 04:18.990
>> I ain't scared, man.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.700
I did three years nay prison
with big men yelling at me.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.410
You think this is--
>> Clay, look at me.

04:24.410 --> 04:25.990
Please do not do that.

04:25.990 --> 04:27.990
That is going to make them
target you.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.990
Stop it.

04:29.990 --> 04:30.000
Clay.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.290
Are you freaking kidding me?

04:31.290 --> 04:31.990
>> I'm just saying.

04:31.990 --> 04:33.990
>> I'm the bigger target here.

04:33.990 --> 04:34.990
He said that clear as day.

04:34.990 --> 04:41.990
>> I'm letting-- I'm not letting
you go home.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.990
>> They're gog break us up right
before jury.

04:44.990 --> 04:45.540
>> It's okay.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.990
>> I should have hung on to that
wall.

04:47.990 --> 04:47.990
I knew it.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.000
I knew it.

04:50.000 --> 04:58.990
I just threw that away.

04:59.990 --> 05:00.990
>> You okay?

05:00.990 --> 05:01.990
>> Yeah.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.120
>> Lines were definitely drawn.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.990
>> I'm sorry, they've got to be
held accountable.

05:06.990 --> 05:09.990
I got held accountable for what
I did.

05:09.990 --> 05:10.950
So-- anyway.

05:10.950 --> 05:13.990
>> Yeah--
>> it hurt me feelings that she

05:13.990 --> 05:18.950
wouldn't even give me a hug and
she acts like she's mad at me

05:18.950 --> 05:19.990
personally and I feel like a
fool again.

05:19.990 --> 05:22.990
Shelli blaming me after she get
put on the block.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.120
How incredibly unfair you don't
accept any responsibility and

05:26.120 --> 05:26.990
blame other people.

05:26.990 --> 05:31.990
>> The thing is they don't care
about nobody's feelings but

05:31.990 --> 05:32.990
themselves.

05:32.990 --> 05:32.990
Whatever.

05:32.990 --> 05:37.990
Somebody had to do it, and I'd
love for someone to win p.O.V.,

05:37.990 --> 05:41.700
and keep the noms safe.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.990
>> I'll say it's the point where
this game has made me so pissed

05:45.990 --> 05:48.700
off I don't trust anyone in this
game except you.

05:48.700 --> 05:48.990
That's fine.

05:48.990 --> 05:53.290
>> It's just payback, and that's
what I'm so mad about about is

05:53.290 --> 05:56.410
why are we the ones to blame?

05:56.410 --> 05:59.990
Why aren't Vanessa and Austin up
there?

05:59.990 --> 06:01.990
Why aren't the twins up there?

06:01.990 --> 06:07.990
Why are we the ones being
blamed?

06:07.990 --> 06:17.990
>> Backdoor Austin, and really
just win p.O.V..

06:17.990 --> 06:19.990
>> What the ( Bleep )?

06:19.990 --> 06:22.990
How do you not give me a hug.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.700
>> Vanessa we're the ones on the
block.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.830
>> I understand that, but I
( Bleep ) For you guy U.S. and

06:27.830 --> 06:29.990
walk away pisd and it makes me
feel like.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.990
>> Because what, is he talking
about--

06:31.990 --> 06:33.990
>> I don't know what ( Bleep )?

06:33.990 --> 06:34.990
You think he told me.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.990
You think of all people he's
going to tell me?

06:36.990 --> 06:37.950
I don't know.

06:37.950 --> 06:38.990
We took a risk last week.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.990
>> And know we did, and it
didn't work out and that's that.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.990
>> We put our asses on the line
for Austin to stay in this game

06:44.990 --> 06:47.990
and he's up there sitting pretty
and you're around there

06:47.990 --> 06:49.990
believing that he doesn't want
to win?

06:49.990 --> 06:54.000
You're putting Austin way higher
than you should be.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.990
And look at me.

06:57.990 --> 06:59.990
I'm going to to do whatever the
hell I can.

06:59.990 --> 07:02.990
If it that means I-- I mean,
Vanessa--

07:02.990 --> 07:05.990
>> listen, in doing, that you're
going to hurt my game.

07:05.990 --> 07:06.290
>> How?

07:06.290 --> 07:10.990
>> And you're going to hurt your
own game.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.990
>> My decision?

07:13.990 --> 07:14.290
Mine?

07:14.290 --> 07:14.990
>> Shh!

07:14.990 --> 07:15.700
Stop.

07:15.700 --> 07:19.990
>> If you insigneuate it's mine,
fine.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.830
>> Vanessa, stop!

07:21.830 --> 07:21.990
>> ( Bleep ) Three of us.

07:21.990 --> 07:23.990
>> Please, stop it!

07:23.990 --> 07:24.990
Sit down.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.000
>> I'm telling you--
>> Vanessa, stop it.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.990
>> You're going to take your
most loyal person and turn them

07:29.990 --> 07:29.990
against you.

07:29.990 --> 07:32.830
>> We're not, can we all keep
owrp voices down?

07:32.830 --> 07:39.990
>> Any time.

07:57.540 --> 07:59.990
>> That's all I want to say.

07:59.990 --> 08:00.990
It's not my ( Bleep ) Decision.

08:00.990 --> 08:01.990
It was ours.

08:01.990 --> 08:05.990
And I'm suchave good person I
don't even put the blame on them

08:05.990 --> 08:06.830
alone.

08:06.830 --> 08:07.290
I take equal responsibility.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.120
>> But they were, right?

08:08.120 --> 08:08.990
>> Of course!

08:08.990 --> 08:13.700
And you don't you know how
infuriating it is to have them

08:13.700 --> 08:14.990
try to pin it on me.

08:14.990 --> 08:15.990
>> We're smarter than that.

08:15.990 --> 08:16.990
>> I don't care.

08:16.990 --> 08:18.990
That's the reason I put them up
on the block right there.

08:18.990 --> 08:21.990
They will do anything they can
to pin stuff off of them.

08:21.990 --> 08:23.990
>> I didn't even try to shift it
to them.

08:23.990 --> 08:26.990
I took the responsibility along
with the rest of the people that

08:26.990 --> 08:28.990
decide it was a better opposite.

08:28.990 --> 08:31.950
>> This is exactly why Clay and
shell resitting on the block.

08:31.950 --> 08:35.000
They like to sit in the back and
make up all kind of excuses and

08:35.000 --> 08:38.990
point fingers everywhere else
but themselves.

08:38.990 --> 08:39.410
This is "Big Brother."

08:39.410 --> 08:39.990
Wake up.

08:39.990 --> 08:44.990
>> James umade the best decision
for your game and we have to all

08:44.990 --> 08:44.990
respect it?

08:44.990 --> 08:46.990
>> I didn't do it just for my
game.

08:46.990 --> 08:50.000
I did it for everyone.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.990
They would have slit someone's
throat.

08:55.990 --> 08:57.990
>> Vanessa's out there laughing
with everybody.

08:57.990 --> 08:58.990
Isn't that cute?

08:58.990 --> 09:00.990
>> I'm going to take most of the
blunt for this.

09:00.990 --> 09:01.990
>> We got you.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.700
>> One of them will be staying?

09:03.700 --> 09:06.990
>> One will be safe, so I'm
going to have to live with that,

09:06.990 --> 09:16.990
but...

09:16.990 --> 09:23.990
>> What are you all talking
about?

09:23.990 --> 09:25.990
Can we talk to you for a second?

09:25.990 --> 09:27.990
>> Has he calmed down?

09:27.990 --> 09:28.990
>> Yeah.

09:28.990 --> 09:37.990
>> Okay.

09:41.990 --> 09:43.990
>> I apologize for blowing up,
by the way?

09:43.990 --> 09:46.990
>> It's all right, man.

09:46.990 --> 09:49.990
>> This is why I got so upset is
because of all the people in

09:49.990 --> 09:54.990
this house, two of the people
right here are the ones who have

09:54.990 --> 09:56.990
your back and will have your
back in this game.

09:56.990 --> 10:00.990
And for you to put them up
doesn't make sense to me.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.990
When we say we've had your back
and we will have your back, I

10:03.990 --> 10:04.990
don't understand that.

10:04.990 --> 10:07.990
>> We haven't betrayed you in
any way.

10:07.990 --> 10:08.990
>> Nor were we ever going to.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.990
>> Come on, Clay!

10:10.990 --> 10:13.990
I've been on the block too many
timeses when Shelli was in

10:13.990 --> 10:13.990
power.

10:13.990 --> 10:16.410
There is no way that you were
looking out for my best

10:16.410 --> 10:16.990
interest.

10:16.990 --> 10:20.990
You all had your all's hands in
all the cookie jars and now you

10:20.990 --> 10:21.990
got caught.

10:21.990 --> 10:22.990
You didn't have to.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.990
If you all would have said, no,
no, we're not doing that.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.990
We're not even talking about
that.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.990
She would have had to throw
Austin up.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.990
Because she knows she didn't
have the votes.

10:32.990 --> 10:38.410
>> The fact that you did make a
deal, we came up and insured

10:38.410 --> 10:40.700
that deal and you still went
against it.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.700
If I ever made a deal like, that
I would have never gone against

10:43.700 --> 10:43.990
it?

10:43.990 --> 10:46.990
>> Y'all two are one, okay.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.990
And shiez going to vote for you,
you're going to vote for her.

10:49.990 --> 10:54.000
If it comes down to me, you, or
her, I'm pretty sure you're not

10:54.000 --> 10:57.950
going to cut her over me and
vice versa all the way around.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.990
The fact of the matter is, it's
already been done.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.990
You can all be pissed, hold
grudges, but it's spilled milk,

11:03.990 --> 11:05.990
so the question is, where do you
go from here?

11:17.990 --> 11:17.990
>> What's up?

11:17.990 --> 11:18.990
>> Hey, come here.

11:18.990 --> 11:21.990
>> Clay and I are on the block
and this is an extremely

11:21.990 --> 11:23.990
sensitive situation.

11:23.990 --> 11:26.990
Vanessa is really upset and I
can't let a move that somebody

11:26.990 --> 11:32.000
else in this game as made come
between my relationship with

11:32.000 --> 11:32.700
v.A.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.990
We were just all upset and
jumping on you.

11:34.990 --> 11:51.990
That was just pure emotion, you
know, that right.

11:51.990 --> 11:58.000
>> Like, that right there--
>> I'm so sorry, I didn't-- I.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.990
Vanessa, you know I have your
back.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.990
>> I want to believe that, but--
I understand it's difficult.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.990
I know it's a tough spot.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.990
Should one of you leave, you
have me still.

12:07.990 --> 12:09.990
>> I'm going to need you so
much.

12:09.990 --> 12:10.990
>> I know.

12:10.990 --> 12:19.990
Listen-- we knew we were going
to end up on the block together,

12:19.990 --> 12:20.990
but why this week of all weeks?

12:20.990 --> 12:21.990
>> I know.

12:21.990 --> 12:24.990
>> When I'm hanging on there and
I could have-- I could have

12:24.990 --> 12:26.990
stayed up on there if I had
known this was going to happen

12:26.990 --> 12:29.990
and I make this deal and
somebody that I put my trust

12:29.990 --> 12:33.990
into, and he breaks it.

12:33.990 --> 12:36.990
Any other week, I would have
been able to handle it, but this

12:36.990 --> 12:36.990
week?

12:36.990 --> 12:37.990
This one?

12:37.990 --> 12:38.990
Why this one?

12:38.990 --> 12:41.990
This is the worst one.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.990
This week is the one that breaks
us up.

12:43.990 --> 12:49.990
I'll be spending the summer in
the jury house without him.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.990
>> I'm standing there watching
Shelli tearing up.

12:52.990 --> 12:54.990
She's hugging v.A.

12:54.990 --> 12:58.830
She's devastated she's not going
to jury with Clay, and all I'm

12:58.830 --> 13:01.990
thinking is, yes, I'm making it
to jury with Liz.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.290
>> I need you all so much.

13:03.290 --> 13:06.540
You have no idea how much I need
you right now.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.990
>> I'm undyingly loyal but I'm
also not a door mat.

13:09.990 --> 13:12.990
It need to be a two-way street.

13:12.990 --> 13:15.990
I cowl see in her eyes that she
saw where I'm coming from maybe

13:15.990 --> 13:17.990
our alliance can survive the
week.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.990
>> It's just so early to lose
each other.

13:19.990 --> 13:20.990
It's just so early.

13:20.990 --> 13:25.990
This just breaks my heart.

13:26.990 --> 13:27.990
>> Hey, everybody!

13:27.990 --> 13:30.990
It's time to pick players for
the veto competition!

13:30.990 --> 13:39.990
Time to get fired up!

13:39.990 --> 13:40.000
Whooo!

13:40.000 --> 13:42.990
Only six people will participate
in the veto competition.

13:42.990 --> 13:46.950
The head of household, the two
nominees, and three other

13:46.950 --> 13:49.990
players selected by random draw.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.000
Putting Shelli and Clay on the
blosks a big move.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.290
Now it comes down to the veto
competition.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.990
I need to have all the power and
win this veto so I can make sure

13:57.990 --> 13:59.700
I keep the nominations the same.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.990
Will the nominees please join me
up here.

14:01.990 --> 14:05.990
>> Only people who can really
win this veto or either me or

14:05.990 --> 14:06.990
Clay.

14:06.990 --> 14:09.950
Typically, we would want one of
our alliance members drawn, but

14:09.950 --> 14:13.000
if the power of veto is used,
most likely one of our alliance

14:13.000 --> 14:14.990
members will be the backup
nominee.

14:14.990 --> 14:21.990
>> As h.O.H. I will pick first.

14:21.990 --> 14:25.990
Houseguest choice.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.540
I choose Jackie.

14:27.540 --> 14:30.830
<i> ( Applause )
</i>>> Since I'm now picked to play,

14:30.830 --> 14:32.990
I'm going to have to get a
little blood on my hand.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.990
I'm going to have to play to win
here to keep the nominations the

14:35.990 --> 14:39.410
samsame.

14:39.410 --> 14:46.700
>> Becky
( Applause )

14:46.700 --> 14:48.290
>> V.A.

14:48.290 --> 14:54.700
( Applause )
>> Being picked to play in the

14:54.700 --> 14:55.990
veto competition is complicated
for me.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.990
If I lose, I could be the
backdoor replacement nominee and

14:58.990 --> 15:02.990
maybe go home this week, but
fiwin the p.O.V. And use it on

15:02.990 --> 15:07.120
Shelli or Clay, I risk pizzing
off the house.

15:07.120 --> 15:09.990
>> Picking players for the veto
competition is not looking good

15:09.990 --> 15:11.830
for Clay and Shelli.

15:11.830 --> 15:14.990
One of them two are going to
have to win veto if they want to

15:14.990 --> 15:19.990
stay in this game.

15:19.990 --> 15:22.990
"Big Brother" will inform us
when the competition is to

15:22.990 --> 15:22.990
begin.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.540
Good luck.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.990
>> Okay, now we can talk as loud
as we want to.

15:27.990 --> 15:31.990
>> I feel like this is going to
get ugly.

15:31.990 --> 15:33.990
>> What, this veto?

15:33.990 --> 15:33.990
Why?

15:33.990 --> 15:37.290
>> Because they, obviously, want
the veto.

15:37.290 --> 15:37.990
And so do we.

15:37.990 --> 15:41.950
>> If it came down to me winning
the veto, I would love to win

15:41.950 --> 15:41.990
it.

15:41.990 --> 15:42.990
>> Know.

15:42.990 --> 15:44.990
>> And keep the noms the same.

15:44.990 --> 15:45.990
>> What's Vanessa going to do?

15:45.990 --> 15:46.990
>> I don't know.

15:46.990 --> 15:47.990
She really likes to win.

15:47.990 --> 15:48.540
>> Yeah.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.990
>> We have four against two.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.990
>> Yeah.

15:52.990 --> 15:53.410
Good odds.

15:53.410 --> 15:56.990
>> I'm in a tough spot for this
veto competition.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.990
I'm taught Kate between two side
of the howts right now.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.990
I like Shelly and Clay in the
house, but James is keeping me

16:01.990 --> 16:01.990
safe.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.990
At this point, I have no idea
what I want to do if I were to

16:04.990 --> 16:05.990
win the veto.

16:05.990 --> 16:09.990
>> This is, like, my week to
have blood on my hands.

16:09.990 --> 16:12.990
I don't like them and I want one
of them to go home.

16:12.990 --> 16:16.990
I'm telling you, for everyone's
game that wants to win 500

16:16.990 --> 16:17.990
grand, this is the best move.

16:17.990 --> 16:18.990
>> And we're done now.

16:18.990 --> 16:19.990
There's no turning back now.

16:19.990 --> 16:21.990
>> Yeah.

16:21.990 --> 16:23.990
>> It's going to get ugly.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.700
Cant get enough Big Brother?

16:34.700 --> 16:36.700
See what's happening live feeds

16:49.990 --> 16:50.990
>> Johnny Mac and I are going to
be wasted.

16:50.990 --> 16:54.990
>> I'm out in the backyard, and
I'm thinking oh, my God, I want

16:54.990 --> 16:56.990
to be competing so bad.

16:56.990 --> 16:59.990
I'm a medieval historian.

16:59.990 --> 17:03.990
Today, heads are going to roll.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.990
>> Welcome to the kingdom of
"big brotherhood" where everyone

17:06.990 --> 17:12.000
is a king or queen but only one
can be crowned with the power of

17:12.000 --> 17:12.830
veto.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.990
This competition will be played
in a series of round.

17:15.990 --> 17:20.990
In each round, you'll catapult
your dart at the giant map.

17:20.990 --> 17:24.990
After everyone has taken a shot,
the player scoring the fewest

17:24.990 --> 17:27.990
point in each round will be
eliminated.

17:27.990 --> 17:30.990
Before taking a seat, claim your
crown and reveal the prize

17:30.990 --> 17:33.990
hiddenned in.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.540
But don't get too attach
tbecause the players eliminated

17:36.540 --> 17:39.990
after you have the option of
keeping their prize or trading

17:39.990 --> 17:40.990
for yours.

17:40.990 --> 17:44.830
The last player standing will
have their choice of any of the

17:44.830 --> 17:47.990
prizes, including the power of
veto.

17:47.990 --> 17:54.950
Who's ready to play game of
throws?

17:54.950 --> 18:00.990
>> I'm lord James, and I got to
show lady Shelli and sir Clay

18:00.990 --> 18:03.990
that it's time to get dirty and
I gotta throw them in the

18:03.990 --> 18:06.950
guillotine and off with their
heads.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.120
>> Vanessa, you're up first.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.990
>> Lady in gold.

18:10.990 --> 18:14.990
Here she goes.

18:14.990 --> 18:15.990
>> Oh, that's fast.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.990
>> One of the most important
things about this competition is

18:17.990 --> 18:22.540
how far you pull a lever back so
that you can control how far the

18:22.540 --> 18:22.990
dart travel.

18:22.990 --> 18:29.990
It's about accuracy, timing and
aim.

18:29.990 --> 18:30.540
>>
( Applause ).

18:30.540 --> 18:33.700
>> Vanessa, you scored a 26.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.990
>> Okay, Vanessa!

18:35.990 --> 18:37.990
>> Clay, you're up next.

18:37.990 --> 18:40.990
>> Being on the block with
Shelli absolutely breaks my

18:40.990 --> 18:40.990
heart.

18:40.990 --> 18:44.410
One of us has to win this veto
so there's hope that both of us

18:44.410 --> 18:50.120
can stay in this game.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.990
You scored a 19.

18:52.990 --> 18:58.990
Becky, you're up next.

18:58.990 --> 18:59.000
11.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.950
Shelli.

18:59.950 --> 19:01.990
>> The stakes are higher than
ever in this competition.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.990
I have got to win or Clay has
got to win.

19:04.990 --> 19:09.990
This is about our life in this
game.

19:09.990 --> 19:12.990
>> Shelli, you scored a 22.

19:12.990 --> 19:14.990
Jackie, you're up next.

19:14.990 --> 19:18.290
>> Round one, I'm super stoked
that Clay and Shelli are both on

19:18.290 --> 19:18.990
the block.

19:18.990 --> 19:23.990
I'm on James' side and got his
back, so I'd love to win the

19:23.990 --> 19:26.990
power of veto here to keep the
noms the same.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.700
I got this baby.

19:29.700 --> 19:29.990
Oh!

19:29.990 --> 19:29.990
No!

19:29.990 --> 19:31.990
>> Oh!

19:31.990 --> 19:34.990
>> James, you need a two or
higher to stay in this game.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.120
>> That's going to be tough.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.000
I'm a very lucky person so there
is no way that I'm walking out

19:40.000 --> 19:49.990
of this veto competition without
that gold medallion power of

19:49.990 --> 19:50.290
veto.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.990
>> James, you've scored a 29.

19:53.990 --> 19:56.990
Sorry, Jackie, you have the
lowest score and will not be

19:56.990 --> 19:58.990
advanced to the next round.

19:58.990 --> 20:03.990
But, everyone's a king in "big
brother" hoopped, so claim the

20:03.990 --> 20:06.990
sixth place crown and reveal
your prize.

20:06.990 --> 20:10.830
>> Here we go!

20:10.830 --> 20:11.990
>> Whooo!

20:11.990 --> 20:13.990
The veto!

20:13.990 --> 20:15.990
I won!

20:15.990 --> 20:16.950
Game over!

20:16.950 --> 20:18.990
>> Congratulations.

20:18.990 --> 20:19.990
You currently have the veto.

20:19.990 --> 20:23.990
>> So I get my sixth place prize
and I win the power of veto.

20:23.990 --> 20:28.990
I know 100% the next person to
win is going to swoop that right

20:28.990 --> 20:28.990
up.

20:28.990 --> 20:31.830
I'll just enjoy it for the time
being.

20:31.830 --> 20:37.990
>> Round two.

20:37.990 --> 20:37.990
22.

20:37.990 --> 20:38.990
<i> ( Applause ).</i>

20:38.990 --> 20:41.990
>> Good work, Clay!

20:41.990 --> 20:47.990
>> Becky, a 17.

20:47.990 --> 20:48.990
( Buzzer ).

20:48.990 --> 20:49.990
>> Sorry, Shelli.

20:49.990 --> 20:51.990
You've landed off the game
border.

20:51.990 --> 20:53.990
>> Damn it.

20:53.990 --> 20:57.990
I was so close.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.990
30 would have been such a good
score, and now I'm drowning in

21:00.990 --> 21:03.990
the water.

21:03.990 --> 21:06.120
>> Shelli hits a zero.

21:06.120 --> 21:06.950
Yes!

21:06.950 --> 21:07.990
Exactly what I wanted.

21:07.990 --> 21:17.990
>> James you're up next.

21:17.990 --> 21:18.990
>> 33.

21:18.990 --> 21:21.990
Vanessa, you need a one or
higher.

21:21.990 --> 21:25.990
>> Good luck.

21:25.990 --> 21:29.990
>> 17.

21:29.990 --> 21:29.990
( Applause ).

21:29.990 --> 21:31.990
>> But I'm out, so.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.120
>> Shell, you got your boy.

21:33.120 --> 21:33.990
You're good.

21:33.990 --> 21:34.990
>> Thanks, Meg.

21:34.990 --> 21:37.830
>> He's fighting for you.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.290
>> Sorry, Shelli.

21:38.290 --> 21:41.290
You have the lowest score, and
will not be advancing to the

21:41.290 --> 21:41.990
next round.

21:41.990 --> 21:48.990
So claim the fifth place crown
and reveal your prize.

21:48.990 --> 21:52.990
>> Knight in shining armor.

21:52.990 --> 21:57.990
>> You've just volunteered to be
a knight in the "big

21:57.990 --> 21:58.950
brotherhood."

21:58.950 --> 22:03.990
In honor of this, you will be
wearing the armor-tard, all week

22:03.990 --> 22:03.990
long.

22:03.990 --> 22:04.990
>> A costume for you.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.950
Do you want to keep the knight
in shining armor prize or trade

22:08.950 --> 22:09.990
it for the veto?

22:09.990 --> 22:13.000
>> As much as I would love the
knight in shining armor, I

22:13.000 --> 22:14.990
already have one in Clay.

22:14.990 --> 22:17.990
So, Jackie, I would love to take
your power of veto.

22:17.990 --> 22:19.990
>> Oh!

22:19.990 --> 22:20.990
Here you go.

22:20.990 --> 22:21.950
>> Why, thank you.

22:21.950 --> 22:25.990
>> Jackie will make a good
humilitard awarer.

22:25.990 --> 22:29.990
>> Vanessa, Clay, Becky, and
James, are you still in the

22:29.990 --> 22:30.540
game.

22:30.540 --> 22:31.990
>> I got one out.

22:31.990 --> 22:33.540
I just need one more to go.

22:33.540 --> 22:36.990
I gotta get Clay out of here
this time.

22:36.990 --> 22:40.990
>> Round three.

22:40.990 --> 22:44.990
You scored a 7.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.990
You scored a 33.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.990
>> Oh wow!

22:49.990 --> 22:50.990
>> All right, Vanessa.

22:50.990 --> 22:53.990
>> Shelli and Clay, two of my
closest allies are on the block.

22:53.990 --> 22:57.990
Even though I don't know what I
would do with the p.O.V. If I

22:57.990 --> 23:01.990
won it, I I have to try to win
because my own butt is on the

23:01.990 --> 23:03.830
line as a backdoor candidate.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.990
( Buzzer ).

23:05.990 --> 23:08.990
>> Vanessa, you scored a zero.

23:08.990 --> 23:09.410
>> Whoops.

23:09.410 --> 23:12.990
>> Clay, you need a one or
higher to remain in the game.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.950
>> Red and royal, here we go!

23:15.950 --> 23:16.990
>> The stakes are high.

23:16.990 --> 23:21.700
At this point, I know that it's
all on me, and I have to get on

23:21.700 --> 23:26.990
the score board because I
desperately need to win this

23:26.990 --> 23:27.990
veto.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.990
>> You've earned a 33, and will
advance.

23:30.990 --> 23:35.990
Vanessa, claim the fourth place
crown and reveal your prize!

23:35.990 --> 23:37.990
>> Ireland castle vacation!

23:37.990 --> 23:43.290
( Cheers and applause )
I'm going to stick with the

23:43.290 --> 23:44.540
Ireland vacation.

23:44.540 --> 23:45.990
>> Wow!

23:45.990 --> 23:51.990
>> Clay, Becky, and James, you
are still in the game.

23:51.990 --> 23:58.120
James, please lead off round
four.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.990
You've scored a 29.

24:01.990 --> 24:05.830
Clay, you're up next.

24:05.830 --> 24:08.700
You've scored a 16.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.410
>> James does get a higher score
with me so it really comes down

24:11.410 --> 24:12.990
to Becky.

24:12.990 --> 24:16.990
I'm just praying she gets a 15
or lower so I can stay in the

24:16.990 --> 24:16.990
game.

24:16.990 --> 24:23.990
>> Becky, you need a 17 or
higher.

24:23.990 --> 24:27.990
>> With a score of 20, you will
be advancing.

24:27.990 --> 24:32.990
>> The one thing that I was
hoping wouldn't happen just

24:32.990 --> 24:33.700
happened.

24:33.700 --> 24:37.700
And now I'm out sthf
competition.

24:37.700 --> 24:41.830
>> Clay, claim the third place
crown and reveal your prize.

24:41.830 --> 24:44.990
>> Knight of shining armor.

24:44.990 --> 24:48.990
>> Every knight in shining armor
needs a loyal squire.

24:48.990 --> 24:52.990
For the next 24 hours, you may
not leave the side of your

24:52.990 --> 24:58.990
knight and must constantly be
shining his or her armor.

24:58.990 --> 25:02.990
>> Me being tied to Jackie for
24 hours and not being able to

25:02.990 --> 25:05.990
talk strategy with Shelli is
huge.

25:05.990 --> 25:11.990
>> Jackie, I love you, but I'm
going to take the Ireland trip.

25:11.990 --> 25:13.990
>> It would have been fin, Clay.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.990
It would have been fun.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.700
>> It's now time for the final
round.

25:20.700 --> 25:20.990
<i> ( Applause ).</i>

25:20.990 --> 25:22.990
>> All right, Becky and James!

25:22.990 --> 25:26.830
>> I need to win this veto
because I put a big master plan

25:26.830 --> 25:26.990
in action.

25:26.990 --> 25:30.290
And the only person that's going
to secure this move to make sure

25:30.290 --> 25:40.990
the noms state same is this guy
right here.

25:40.990 --> 25:41.410
( Applause ).

25:41.410 --> 25:44.990
>> Becky, you need to score an
11 or higher to beat James and

25:44.990 --> 25:46.990
win the final round.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.120
>> Clay's out of the veto
competition, and now we just

25:50.120 --> 25:52.000
have Becky against James.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.990
Becky has been there for us this
week, so it's a long shot, but

25:55.990 --> 26:04.990
she might use the veto on us.

26:04.990 --> 26:05.990
( Buzzer ).

26:05.990 --> 26:09.990
>> Sorry, Becky.

26:09.990 --> 26:13.990
Claim the second place crown and
reveal your prize.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.990
>> $5,000.

26:15.990 --> 26:16.990
<i> ( Applause ).</i>

26:16.990 --> 26:18.990
>> Oh, baby!

26:18.990 --> 26:22.990
>> Would you like to keep your 5
k or trade it for one of the

26:22.990 --> 26:22.990
other prizes?

26:22.990 --> 26:26.990
>> I'm tempted, but I am going
to keep the 5 p

26:26.990 --> 26:33.990
( applause )
>> James, please claim your

26:33.990 --> 26:35.990
first place prize.

26:35.990 --> 26:36.990
>> Castle guard.

26:36.990 --> 26:40.120
>> You have become a member of
the "Big Brother" castle guard.

26:40.120 --> 26:46.990
You must complete the swordsman
training regimen 2400 times in

26:46.990 --> 26:48.830
24 hours.

26:48.830 --> 26:49.290
>> Oh, whoa!

26:49.290 --> 26:52.990
>> If you fail to fulfill your
guard duty, you shall be exiled

26:52.990 --> 26:54.990
from the next veto competition.

26:54.990 --> 26:57.990
Would you like to keep the
castle guard or trade it for one

26:57.990 --> 27:00.990
of the other prizes?

27:00.990 --> 27:00.990
>>
( Size ).

27:00.990 --> 27:04.990
>> I'm just sitting here hoping
with all my might that the cash

27:04.990 --> 27:07.990
prize means more to him than
getting out me or Clay.

27:07.990 --> 27:12.990
>> I'm looking at that 5k., and
it's looking real tempting.

27:12.990 --> 27:15.950
That money could definitely
change my little girl's life.

27:15.950 --> 27:18.990
This is a hard decision Clay and
Shelli, you all have your trip

27:18.990 --> 27:19.990
to Ireland.

27:19.990 --> 27:25.990
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to
take the veto.

27:25.990 --> 27:33.950
( Applause )
>> Congratulations, James.

27:33.950 --> 27:37.990
You have won the golden power of
veto.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.990
>> Good work, James.

27:40.990 --> 27:41.990
>> My hero.

27:41.990 --> 27:45.540
>> Sometimes when you want
things done, you gotta do them

27:45.540 --> 27:45.990
yourself.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.990
With that being said, I have so
much bling, right now.

27:48.990 --> 27:53.990
I got the h.O.H. Key, my power
of veto medallion right now.

27:53.990 --> 27:56.410
I'm definitely feeling like a
rap star.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.410
Good job, guys.

27:58.410 --> 28:01.990
>> That was the one person we
didn't want to win, and he did.

28:01.990 --> 28:02.990
I didn't pull it out.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.990
Me and Shelli are in a tough
spot.

28:05.990 --> 28:06.990
>> It's going to be okay.

28:06.990 --> 28:07.830
Come here.

28:13.990 --> 28:18.990
>> Me and Clay are still on the
block together, and we could be

28:18.990 --> 28:20.990
losing each other this week, and
what can we do?

28:34.990 --> 28:36.990
Be a fly on the wall

28:59.290 --> 29:02.990
it's a bad feeling knowing that
you failed and you can't protect

29:02.990 --> 29:04.990
the within person who has had
your back in this game.

29:04.990 --> 29:08.990
We have one last-ditch effort to
save ourselves.

29:08.990 --> 29:10.700
It's not oaf yet.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.990
>> There's no way he'll change
it.

29:12.990 --> 29:16.990
You don't know.

29:16.990 --> 29:19.990
>> It's just two months.

29:19.990 --> 29:22.990
>> I think two months without
seeing his face, without having

29:22.990 --> 29:27.540
him with me in this house,
that's going to be really a

29:27.540 --> 29:31.990
long, long, long two months.

29:31.990 --> 29:34.990
>> We've got something that's
way better than winning this

29:34.990 --> 29:38.540
game.

29:38.540 --> 30:00.990
>> Shelli, please go to the
diary room.

30:00.990 --> 30:03.410
>> I just need a hug.

30:03.410 --> 30:06.990
>> I can't stand you.

30:06.990 --> 30:07.990
Are you okay?

30:07.990 --> 30:08.990
>> Yeah, I'm fine.

30:08.990 --> 30:11.990
>> Are you sure?

30:11.990 --> 30:12.830
Are you sure?

30:12.830 --> 30:13.990
>> It's a game.

30:13.990 --> 30:14.990
>> I know it is.

30:14.990 --> 30:17.990
I know it is.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.000
I always have had your back.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.990
>> Clay and Shelli are going to
get split up, and Meg is a

30:22.990 --> 30:23.990
little drunk.

30:23.990 --> 30:29.990
She's getting over-the-top
emergency and you can't help but

30:29.990 --> 30:32.990
see her fighting those primal
urges.

30:32.990 --> 30:35.990
They're struggling to stay off
each other, but they're not.

30:35.990 --> 30:37.990
>> I'll make you a promise.

30:37.990 --> 30:41.990
>> Will you vote me out, not
her?

30:41.990 --> 30:44.990
>> I can't make you that
promise.

30:44.990 --> 30:51.990
Ybi can't make you that promise.

30:51.990 --> 30:53.950
I can't have you.

30:53.950 --> 30:59.990
I can't have you doing this, and
then I can't promise you that.

30:59.990 --> 31:01.990
>>
>> it's not about that.

31:01.990 --> 31:11.990
>> Stop!

31:27.700 --> 31:27.990
>> Stop.

31:27.990 --> 31:33.990
>> I know, but I'm telling you--
>> you can't ask that of me.

31:33.990 --> 31:39.990
You know how I feel about you.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.830
You had to go along with the
little lady friend.

31:42.830 --> 32:05.990
And, like-- that's just how it
is.

32:05.990 --> 32:09.990
>> Vanessa, Jackie, please go to
the diary room.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.000
>> Oh!

32:11.000 --> 32:17.990
>> Well, we didn't win the veto,
but we got handed a couple of

32:17.990 --> 32:18.120
punishments.

32:18.120 --> 32:19.990
>> Attention, townspeople!

32:19.990 --> 32:20.990
>> Oh, yeah!

32:20.990 --> 32:23.990
>> I would like to announce the
arrival of jacqueline the great,

32:23.990 --> 32:27.990
the knight herself, and myself,
her local squire.

32:27.990 --> 32:31.990
As part of my duties, you must
Polish her and buff her for 24

32:31.990 --> 32:32.990
hours straight.

32:32.990 --> 32:34.000
>> Yeah!

32:34.000 --> 32:35.990
>> Yeah!

32:35.990 --> 32:36.540
Polish that armor.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.990
>> It feels like a cat licking
me.

32:39.990 --> 32:39.990
It's weird.

32:39.990 --> 32:42.990
>> Oh, my God!

32:42.990 --> 32:45.290
>> That looks so cute!

32:45.290 --> 32:50.990
>> It's kind of turning me on.

32:50.990 --> 32:53.990
>> Let's do this!

32:53.990 --> 32:58.990
>> For this punishment, I have
to do a swordsman regimen.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.990
>> What the hell?

33:00.990 --> 33:08.990
>> That includes swiping a
punching bag.

33:08.990 --> 33:09.990
>> Yes!

33:09.990 --> 33:11.990
>> Stabbing a target.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.120
Slicing a bar.

33:15.120 --> 33:21.540
That counts as one regimen, and
I have to do this regimen 2400

33:21.540 --> 33:23.990
times in 24 hours.

33:23.990 --> 33:31.410
>> Queen shell!

33:31.410 --> 33:31.950
2.

33:31.950 --> 33:36.990
>> So I'm watching Shelli train
to be part of the castle guard.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.990
And I'm think yg do you want to
do this?

33:38.990 --> 33:41.990
What's protecting a castle your
whole life going to get you?

33:41.990 --> 33:46.540
The best you can hope for is
you'll die, like a flaming arrow

33:46.540 --> 33:51.990
will come in and put your body
on fire and you can jump from

33:51.990 --> 33:54.990
the top of the wall, something
epic like that.

33:54.990 --> 33:57.990
In reality you're probably going
to die from something stupid

33:57.990 --> 33:59.990
like tetanus for your own sword.

33:59.990 --> 34:03.000
>> Every 100, I have to run
inside the "Big Brother" house

34:03.000 --> 34:07.990
and ring a billion.

34:07.990 --> 34:07.990
Hear!

34:07.990 --> 34:10.990
The kingdom is saved.

34:10.990 --> 34:13.990
And let the kingdom know they
are safe.

34:13.990 --> 34:14.990
Only 2300 more to go.

34:14.990 --> 34:16.990
>> Hey, hey, choir.

34:16.990 --> 34:19.990
You just keep waxing that leg.

34:19.990 --> 34:22.990
>> Vanessa, unfortunately, has
to do whatever I do.

34:22.990 --> 34:25.990
So fifeel like eating, she's got
to come to the kitchen with me.

34:25.990 --> 34:29.990
If I fee like going to the
bathroom, she has to go to the

34:29.990 --> 34:30.990
bathroom, too.

34:30.990 --> 34:38.990
>> Shine that armor, squire!

34:38.990 --> 34:43.290
>> Jackie, what do you think
about a potty break?

34:43.290 --> 34:51.990
( Snoring )
>> My knees are killing me.

34:51.990 --> 34:54.990
I've just got to do this 1,000
more times.

34:54.990 --> 34:55.990
Why do I feel bad?

34:55.990 --> 34:59.990
James is the one hogave me this
punishment.

34:59.990 --> 35:02.000
>> The bastard.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.410
Of all the people to have power.

35:03.410 --> 35:03.990
>> I know.

35:03.990 --> 35:05.990
It's disgusting.

35:05.990 --> 35:08.990
>> We gotta say when we gotta
say right now.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.990
We've got one shot to stay this
this game.

35:10.990 --> 35:16.990
This is our last-ditch effort,
so we got to say maybe a little

35:16.990 --> 35:20.990
more than we're willing to do.

35:20.990 --> 35:23.990
>> The sun's come up.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.990
How is she still doing that?

35:25.990 --> 35:29.540
>> I am outside fighting these
2400 battles.

35:29.540 --> 35:30.290
Oh, I can barely walk.

35:30.290 --> 35:33.990
When really I know that there is
just one really big battle that

35:33.990 --> 35:34.990
I should be fighting.

35:34.990 --> 35:37.700
I don't think you understand how
much I hurt right now.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.990
You know what I want to do?

35:38.990 --> 35:43.990
I want to take that bell
straight up to the h.O.H. Room.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.290
My toes hurt really bad.

35:46.290 --> 35:48.990
>> Looking hot.

35:48.990 --> 35:50.990
>> Feeling hot.

35:50.990 --> 35:52.990
>> I figured it out.

35:52.990 --> 35:56.990
It's 158,400.

35:56.990 --> 35:57.990
>> Feet?

35:57.990 --> 35:58.990
>> Yeah.

35:58.990 --> 36:04.990
>> That's a thankless job, but
someone's got to do it.

36:04.990 --> 36:06.540
>> Shelli's crazy.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.990
She's just beating through this.

36:07.990 --> 36:11.990
>> I mean, like, that's the only
way to do it with the time frame

36:11.990 --> 36:14.990
for what she has to do.

36:14.990 --> 36:31.990
>> It's excruciating.

36:34.990 --> 36:38.990
>> Come on, Shelli!

36:38.990 --> 36:47.990
>> Whooo!

36:47.990 --> 36:53.990
>> All right, you have now
become knight of the "big

36:53.990 --> 36:55.990
brother" roundtable.

36:55.990 --> 36:56.120
( Cheers and applause ).

36:56.120 --> 37:00.990
>> Victory, I have fought 2400
battles.

37:00.990 --> 37:04.990
My punishment is over.

37:04.990 --> 37:09.990
But, there's still a lot of work
to do.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.990
Battles fought and won.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.990
Now I've got to get to work and
I've got to get James to use the

37:14.990 --> 37:19.830
power of veto.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.990
>> Do you want to go into the
h.O.H. Room?

37:40.990 --> 37:43.990
>> We can go in the hammock or
h.O.H. Room.

37:43.990 --> 37:45.990
>> Let's do h.O.H.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.950
>> Fican make it up the stairs.

37:48.950 --> 37:51.990
Clay and I are majorly in
jeopardy right now sitting on

37:51.990 --> 37:53.990
the block next to each other
without the power of veto.

37:53.990 --> 37:56.990
I have some information that I
can give James that I learned

37:56.990 --> 37:59.540
from the twins and hopefully
this information will help sway

37:59.540 --> 38:03.990
James to use the power of veto
and put right person up on the

38:03.990 --> 38:03.990
block.

38:03.990 --> 38:05.830
>> We're by ourselves right now.

38:05.830 --> 38:08.990
We realize that there's no one
in this house that has our

38:08.990 --> 38:09.540
backs.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.990
I would love to expose some
people, believe me, but that's

38:11.990 --> 38:13.990
not the type of person they am.

38:13.990 --> 38:20.990
>> Ever since we got blindsides
with Jason going home, I knew

38:20.990 --> 38:22.990
there was something going on
behind our backs.

38:22.990 --> 38:25.990
For me to even think about
saving them, they're going to

38:25.990 --> 38:27.990
have to give me some
information.

38:27.990 --> 38:31.990
At the end of this conversation,
would I be able to put somebody

38:31.990 --> 38:36.700
up in that seat if I pull
somebody down?

38:36.700 --> 38:39.990
>> I'm just afraid what kind of
attack I'm going to get for

38:39.990 --> 38:40.540
this.

38:40.540 --> 38:41.120
That's all.

38:41.120 --> 38:45.830
>> Well, you might get attacked,
but the thing is, you'll still

38:45.830 --> 38:46.990
be here.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.990
>> Here's a couple of things
about Austin.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.990
Austin has an alter ego called
Judas.

38:53.990 --> 38:56.290
It was his wrestling name.

38:56.290 --> 39:00.990
So sometimes if he makes a
promise to you, Austin might be

39:00.990 --> 39:03.990
making that promise but Judas
isn't making that promise.

39:03.990 --> 39:07.540
So Judas might turn on Austin's
word.

39:07.540 --> 39:13.540
>> Have you been under any
narcotics medicines?

39:13.540 --> 39:20.990
>> Judas was the Bible --
>> the biggest betrair in the

39:20.990 --> 39:21.410
Bible.

39:21.410 --> 39:25.290
Judas is the one person who
voted for Audrey to stay.

39:25.290 --> 39:29.990
He's also the one who when Liz
was h.O.H., Jackie and you were

39:29.990 --> 39:30.990
put up on the block.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.990
>> Yeah.

39:32.990 --> 39:39.990
>> It was originally not you,
but he changed it at the last

39:39.990 --> 39:39.990
minute.

39:39.990 --> 39:42.990
I just look at him now and feel
very angry because I think an

39:42.990 --> 39:46.120
extremely innocent, wonderful,
beautiful, deserving person in

39:46.120 --> 39:53.830
this game got sent home to save
this person.

39:53.830 --> 39:55.990
>> We've got a bunch of savages
in here.

39:55.990 --> 39:58.990
>> He's just not trustworthy.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.990
>> Well, I'm definitely, of
course, I'm going to have to

40:01.990 --> 40:02.990
some time to think.

40:02.990 --> 40:05.990
It, take it all in, weigh
options out, and then, like,

40:05.990 --> 40:12.830
come up with a decision.

40:25.990 --> 40:27.990
>> Hey, everybody.

40:27.990 --> 40:43.990
It's time for the veto meeting.

40:43.990 --> 40:45.990
This is the veto meeting.

40:45.990 --> 40:49.700
Clay, Shelli, you have been
nominated for eviction, but I

40:49.700 --> 40:52.990
have the power to veto one of my
nominations.

40:52.990 --> 40:56.290
I want to give both of y'all the
chance to tell me why I should

40:56.290 --> 40:58.990
use the veto to save you guys.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.990
Clay, you're up first.

41:01.990 --> 41:02.990
( Clears throat ).

41:02.990 --> 41:08.990
>> You know, there's no other
person I'd rather play this game

41:08.990 --> 41:09.410
with.

41:09.410 --> 41:12.540
And wharf happens, happens, and
I know that I'll always have you

41:12.540 --> 41:17.990
outside of this game.

41:17.990 --> 41:21.990
>> Shelli, now it's your turn to
speak.

41:21.990 --> 41:25.410
>> Same right back to you,
obviously.

41:25.410 --> 41:28.990
I think that we've been very
good to the people in this

41:28.990 --> 41:33.990
house, good on our word, and I
just don't think this we deserve

41:33.990 --> 41:35.990
to be in this position right
now.

41:35.990 --> 41:39.990
That's all I can say.

41:39.990 --> 41:44.990
>> Clay and Shelli, we were on
good terms.

41:44.990 --> 41:47.990
>> And just felt like you guys
turned your back on me, just

41:47.990 --> 41:51.990
left me in the dark on a lot of
things.

41:51.990 --> 41:57.990
So with that being said, I have
decided not to use the power of

41:57.990 --> 42:05.990
veto.

42:07.990 --> 42:13.000
This veto meeting is adjourned.

42:14.990 --> 42:22.990
>> The last thing that I want to
do is to hear them say anything

42:22.990 --> 42:23.120
bad about Clay.

42:23.120 --> 42:27.990
I do have to fight for myself in
this game, but I just can't

42:27.990 --> 42:30.990
fight against him.

42:30.990 --> 42:33.990
>> Of course, I'm competitive,
but I think that she has a

42:33.990 --> 42:36.120
better shot at winning this game
than I do.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.990
There's no way in hell that I
can sit there and campaign

42:38.990 --> 42:39.990
against this girl.

42:39.990 --> 42:42.990
>> This guy right here has
always been taught ain't nothing

42:42.990 --> 42:45.410
better than going through the
front door.

42:45.410 --> 42:48.830
Backdoor is just as good, but
you only use it had you lose the

42:48.830 --> 42:49.990
key.

42:49.990 --> 42:53.990
>> Who will be evicted from the
"Big Brother" house, Shelli or

42:53.990 --> 42:54.990
Clay?

42:54.990 --> 43:01.990
And the power is up for grabs in
an all-new battle for head of

43:01.990 --> 43:02.950
household.

43:02.950 --> 43:04.990
It all happens live tomorrow at
9:00, 8:00 central on "big

43:04.990 --> 43:05.410
brother."
