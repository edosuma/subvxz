00:06.057 --> 00:11.848
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.057 --> 00:15.855
That creature is us.

00:18.737 --> 00:22.412
All over the world
we still use our ingenuity

00:22.457 --> 00:24.925
to survive in the wild places,

00:24.977 --> 00:29.971
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.137 --> 00:34.334
This is the Human Planet.

00:47.977 --> 00:52.095
Deserts are the hottest
and driest places on Earth.

00:53.217 --> 00:56.414
They cover one third
of the land's surface.

00:58.097 --> 01:01.533
Some never see rain.

01:05.697 --> 01:08.450
We can survive two months without food...

01:10.017 --> 01:12.690
...yet only a few days without water.

01:15.097 --> 01:19.852
As babies, we spend nine months
surrounded by fluid in our mother's womb.

01:21.417 --> 01:26.332
But birth pushes us
out of this luxurious water world.

01:37.257 --> 01:38.770
From this point on,

01:38.817 --> 01:42.935
life for every child of the desert
is defined by the quest for water.

01:44.697 --> 01:47.291
Yet, somehow, in this brutal land,

01:47.337 --> 01:50.773
an incredible 300 million people survive.

01:52.217 --> 01:55.971
These are their remarkable stories.

02:26.537 --> 02:30.246
The Sahara is the biggest desert
on the globe.

02:35.417 --> 02:38.614
It is the size of the United States,

02:38.657 --> 02:44.448
and its arid interior can unleash
the mightiest sandstorms on the planet.

02:49.417 --> 02:54.445
Ferocious winds whip up
billions of tiny sand grains,

02:54.497 --> 02:56.215
into massive walls...

02:57.857 --> 03:00.929
...reaching more than 5,000 metres
into the air,

03:00.977 --> 03:05.050
ten times the height
of the Empire State Building,

03:05.097 --> 03:07.895
covering areas the size of Britain.

03:19.617 --> 03:24.737
Battling through this sandstorm in Mali
is 1 6-year-old Mamadou.

03:26.577 --> 03:30.047
He's a cattle herder who left home
three days ago

03:30.097 --> 03:32.895
on a mission to find water for his cows.

03:41.697 --> 03:46.088
It's a huge responsibility
on his teenage shoulders.

03:48.017 --> 03:51.487
He must endure
the fury of the desert alone,

03:51.537 --> 03:54.529
but there's an even bigger challenge
ahead.

03:57.377 --> 04:00.608
He's in a race against
the biggest land animal on Earth -

04:00.657 --> 04:02.887
African elephants.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.810
This desert herd is also
desperate for water

04:06.857 --> 04:10.213
because Mali is gripped by drought.

04:12.577 --> 04:15.774
It's 40 degrees Celsius.

04:15.817 --> 04:19.093
Most of the water holes are already dry.

04:19.137 --> 04:23.255
Only one place for 80 kilometres
will still have water...

04:24.457 --> 04:25.936
...Lake Banzena.

04:28.537 --> 04:31.973
And this is where both the elephants
and Mamadou are heading.

04:48.417 --> 04:53.013
If Mamadou keeps up a fast pace,
he'll reach the lake by morning.

04:54.017 --> 04:58.852
But only 50 kilometres behind him
are the greatest nomads of the desert.

05:01.737 --> 05:04.809
Elephant matriarchs guide the herd,

05:04.857 --> 05:08.293
following an incredible mental map
of all the water holes

05:08.337 --> 05:12.171
to be found in an area of
tens of thousands of square kilometres.

05:13.737 --> 05:16.774
Acacia trees give them
just enough fuel to keep walking

05:16.817 --> 05:20.526
but they can't rest, day or night.

05:23.897 --> 05:28.687
But, for Mamadou, nightfall means
he has no choice but to stop.

05:28.737 --> 05:31.376
Meeting elephants in the dark
could be fatal.

05:39.217 --> 05:42.209
A hurried breakfast is
the little precious milk

05:42.257 --> 05:44.134
Mamadou can get from his cows.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.930
It keeps him one step away
from dehydration.

05:49.537 --> 05:52.176
But he's got to get going.

05:53.657 --> 05:58.094
The elephant herd have walked
through the night, making up ground.

06:11.297 --> 06:14.528
Finally the end is in sight for Mamadou.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.411
But he walks straight into trouble.

06:19.457 --> 06:23.655
Not only have the massive elephant herd
beaten him to the lake,

06:23.697 --> 06:26.257
but they're also blocking
his access to the water.

06:36.097 --> 06:40.329
Mamadou knows the elephants could charge,

06:40.377 --> 06:42.607
so he is careful not to get too close.

06:47.337 --> 06:51.853
It's an uneasy truce
while he works out how to break through.

06:59.617 --> 07:02.006
Suddenly an elephant charges his cows.

07:06.977 --> 07:09.889
Mamadou fights back,
but armed only with sticks,

07:09.937 --> 07:12.326
it's a battle of David and Goliath.

07:29.697 --> 07:34.327
Mamadou's courage has managed
to shift over 50 elephants.

07:40.257 --> 07:43.886
Luckily, conflicts like this
are very rare.

07:53.897 --> 07:59.051
Finally Mamadou drives his cattle
towards the life-giving water.

08:09.457 --> 08:14.212
The elephants move off
and find their own part of the lake.

08:15.977 --> 08:20.095
At last, they too have
an opportunity to drink...

08:22.137 --> 08:23.650
...and even play.

08:33.177 --> 08:36.772
It will be two months
before there's any chance

08:36.817 --> 08:39.206
of rain replenishing the water holes,

08:39.257 --> 08:41.407
so Mamadou's struggles will go on.

08:44.497 --> 08:46.294
But in one part of the desert,

08:46.337 --> 08:50.216
a shrinking water supply leads to
a surprising opportunity.

08:56.257 --> 09:00.694
Hundreds of kilometres away,
along the Bandiagara escarpment,

09:00.737 --> 09:04.252
the sapping 40-degree heat
has sucked the life

09:04.297 --> 09:06.811
out of the rivers of Dogon country,

09:06.857 --> 09:09.007
leaving only isolated pools

09:09.057 --> 09:11.173
stuffed with stranded fish.

09:12.377 --> 09:16.336
The Dogon choose this moment
for a desert fishing festival.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.890
Thousands of competitors
are drawn to Lake Antogo,

09:27.937 --> 09:32.567
including Dialo,
who's been coming here for 30 years.

09:32.617 --> 09:35.654
It's a matter of pride for him
to catch a fish.

09:50.057 --> 09:54.335
On any other day, fishing is strictly
forbidden in this sacred water.

09:56.617 --> 10:01.372
In this way, the elders protect
an important food reserve

10:01.417 --> 10:03.931
well into the dry season.

10:03.977 --> 10:10.132
But today the community have a chance
to catch a symbolic last supper.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.730
The banks are filling up quickly.

10:20.017 --> 10:23.487
The atmosphere is tense.

10:26.057 --> 10:29.288
Dialo has found a good spot.

10:30.577 --> 10:36.413
But now he must wait
since Antogo has its own unwritten rules.

10:43.137 --> 10:48.848
The ceremonial chief chants a prayer
to chase away evil spirits.

10:48.897 --> 10:53.925
He wears a fish trap, believed to protect
the words as they are spoken.

10:53.977 --> 10:57.811
This is Dialo's once-a-year chance.

11:21.497 --> 11:25.172
The free-for-all
quickly becomes a fishing frenzy.

11:38.697 --> 11:42.133
They thrust their baskets down
to trap the fish.

11:44.017 --> 11:48.454
Dialo has caught one,
but there's no time for politeness.

12:24.937 --> 12:28.850
Afterjust 1 5 minutes,
there's nothing left,

12:28.897 --> 12:30.933
and the chaos subsides.

12:30.977 --> 12:34.287
Dialo is successful but exhausted.

12:42.577 --> 12:47.571
Back at home, his proud catch of fish
becomes a final feast for his family

12:47.617 --> 12:50.973
so they can survive
the last days of the dry season.

13:12.137 --> 13:14.776
Far to the east of the Bandiagara,

13:14.817 --> 13:18.890
it takes immense navigational skill
just to find water.

13:21.257 --> 13:27.776
These Tubu women must venture
across the vast sand seas of the Sahara,

13:27.817 --> 13:32.527
in search of a miniature well
just one metre square.

13:32.577 --> 13:35.410
It will mean the difference
between life and death.

13:53.017 --> 13:58.091
They call this place the Tenere -
the land of nothing.

13:58.137 --> 14:02.892
It is featureless, scorching
and unreliable.

14:05.417 --> 14:10.810
Foni is a Tubu woman who can find her way
to water without a map or a compass.

14:17.817 --> 14:22.368
She's brought her daughter,
Shede, only ten years old.

14:22.417 --> 14:25.773
The well they seek
is still three days' walk away.

14:25.817 --> 14:30.288
This is the toughest journey
they'll ever face together.

14:39.217 --> 14:43.893
They undertake
this perilous journey for food.

14:43.937 --> 14:48.374
They must cross 240 kilometres
just to get to market,

14:48.417 --> 14:52.649
to trade camels for supplies
that will last them six months.

14:54.257 --> 14:57.169
This caravan is only women and children,

14:57.217 --> 15:01.768
since, for the Tubu, it's the women
who are the great navigators.

15:06.977 --> 15:11.095
To the untrained eye,
a dune is just a dune.

15:11.137 --> 15:16.894
But Foni can tell which ones to trust,
in a place where nothing stands still.

15:19.617 --> 15:23.212
Smaller dunes shape-shift,
moving with the wind,

15:23.257 --> 15:25.487
making them unreliable.

15:26.977 --> 15:32.370
But larger dunes,
towering over 60 metres, are more stable,

15:32.417 --> 15:35.170
revealing signs of a much bigger picture.

15:37.537 --> 15:38.936
Over thousands of years,

15:38.977 --> 15:44.210
prevailing desert winds have blown dunes
into long parallel ridges,

15:44.257 --> 15:47.374
the only landmarks for the travellers.

15:50.417 --> 15:55.093
The Tubu look to the sun and the ridge
line to work out which direction to go.

15:55.137 --> 15:59.813
Then they count each ridge
to know how far they've gone.

16:07.657 --> 16:11.650
They've been walking for ten hours
in the blazing sun.

16:11.697 --> 16:13.653
They must rest.

16:20.417 --> 16:25.889
They make their camp out of
a single sheet, and ration their water.

16:29.257 --> 16:34.411
The camels'share is mixed with oats,
while the women drink sweet tea.

17:07.697 --> 17:12.168
They rise early,
before the sun gets too hot.

17:14.057 --> 17:16.855
They only carry enough water
to get to the well,

17:16.897 --> 17:19.969
so the pace they travel is key.

17:24.057 --> 17:28.209
This specialist understanding
of the desert is fast disappearing.

17:28.257 --> 17:32.728
Today only a few hundred Tubu women
possess the knowledge.

17:35.057 --> 17:37.776
Foni believes that, by teaching Shede,

17:37.817 --> 17:41.173
she can keep it alive
for another generation.

18:00.577 --> 18:02.647
When darkness falls,

18:02.697 --> 18:07.452
Foni also teaches Shede
how to read the night sky.

18:23.177 --> 18:26.965
For now, at least,
they know they're on the right path.

18:31.217 --> 18:34.050
It's day three.

18:34.097 --> 18:36.247
Today they must find the well.

18:38.057 --> 18:42.289
While packing up, Foni decides
Shede is ready to take charge.

18:46.577 --> 18:48.215
But the well is so hidden

18:48.257 --> 18:52.409
that even if she's only a few hundred
metres away, she could miss it.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.205
She sets them off in the right direction,

19:00.257 --> 19:05.285
aligning herself between the ridges ahead
and the sunrise to the east.

19:07.337 --> 19:11.046
For some children Shede's age,
just ten years old,

19:11.097 --> 19:13.895
finding their way to school
is challenge enough.

19:15.777 --> 19:20.931
But Shede has to find her way 20 miles
across the bleakest landscape on Earth.

19:26.897 --> 19:29.934
But with her mother's guiding words
echoing in her head,

19:29.977 --> 19:32.366
she strides forward.

19:35.457 --> 19:41.612
After a gruelling 1 2-hours'riding,
the tenth ridge is finally in sight.

19:44.977 --> 19:48.890
The lonely bush in the dip of the dune
marks the valley of the well.

20:01.377 --> 20:05.211
Shede has found the only well
for 80 kilometres around.

20:06.577 --> 20:09.045
She's made her mum proud.

20:16.417 --> 20:19.773
Finally, Shede can water the camels.

20:27.497 --> 20:31.968
With their thirst quenched,
she washes off three days of dust.

20:35.657 --> 20:39.491
Now they've got water,
they'll make it to market,

20:39.537 --> 20:43.132
but they're still weeks away
from finishing theirjourney.

20:47.857 --> 20:51.133
Not all deserts are swelteringly hot.

20:52.617 --> 20:56.292
The Gobi in Mongolia is
a desert of extremes.

20:56.337 --> 20:59.056
Lying far north of the equator,

20:59.097 --> 21:04.535
here scorching summer highs plunge
to freezing Arctic lows.

21:05.937 --> 21:09.213
It's February, minus 20 degrees Celsius,

21:09.257 --> 21:13.375
and the few wells people have
are frozen over.

21:16.577 --> 21:20.616
But, amazingly,
water appears here as snow.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.807
The snow doesn't fall here.

21:24.857 --> 21:28.645
It's blown over 3,000 kilometres
from Siberia.

21:28.697 --> 21:32.326
And these bitter winds means
it never settles for long.

21:36.057 --> 21:40.573
So, Ganbold
and his twin-humped Bactrian camels

21:40.617 --> 21:44.895
must chase the snow
towards the mountains where it lingers.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.531
This rare snow is a lifeline.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.132
It's so important,

21:58.177 --> 22:02.295
he and his family have set up
their winter camp in the foothills.

22:03.457 --> 22:05.573
But he's taking a risk.

22:06.737 --> 22:09.297
His herd, including pregnant females,

22:09.337 --> 22:13.615
are now in the hunting grounds
of a voracious desert predator,

22:13.657 --> 22:17.855
and they like nothing better
than newborn camel flesh.

22:34.337 --> 22:38.330
Gobi desert wolves roam
over thousands of kilometres.

22:39.377 --> 22:43.848
Their keen sense of smell
helps them shadow the herds at a distance.

22:46.217 --> 22:50.847
If Ganbold drops his guard,
they'll attack.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.210
He returns to camp to hear that
his son has interrupted a wolf attack.

22:56.257 --> 22:58.930
One sheep has been killed.

23:18.857 --> 23:23.726
As evening falls,
an icy dust storm builds.

23:36.497 --> 23:40.934
In the warm tent,
wolves are the only topic of conversation.

24:06.577 --> 24:11.935
At midnight, Ganbold checks
his pregnant camels one last time.

24:18.817 --> 24:22.526
He suddenly realises
his prize female is missing

24:22.577 --> 24:26.172
but, with the storm,
they can't look for her until daylight.

24:45.697 --> 24:49.576
Come dawn, the search is on to find out
what has become of her

24:49.617 --> 24:51.847
and her unborn calf.

25:04.577 --> 25:07.410
Ganbold musters his friends.

25:07.457 --> 25:10.733
It's a race between them and the wolves.

25:15.897 --> 25:18.206
They find tracks.

25:23.817 --> 25:29.369
Ganbold heads to the highest ridge,
and the scale of his task becomes clear.

25:46.257 --> 25:47.770
More fresh tracks.

26:08.177 --> 26:10.975
They've seen off the enemy,

26:11.017 --> 26:13.736
but is the camel nearby?

26:17.937 --> 26:20.497
Finally, they see a shape.

26:24.977 --> 26:28.253
Ganbold's beloved camel is alive.

26:28.297 --> 26:30.765
And she's given birth.

26:35.377 --> 26:37.607
But the calf isn't moving.

26:39.817 --> 26:42.729
Tchoo! Tchoo!

26:48.657 --> 26:51.933
To his great relief,
the calf is breathing.

26:58.297 --> 27:01.130
Ooh! Ha-ha-ha!

27:11.617 --> 27:16.771
Only a few hours old,
the calf is too weak to walk back to camp.

27:16.817 --> 27:19.251
So Ganbold gives it a lift.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.248
His son rushes out to help

27:29.297 --> 27:34.132
and his other boys meet
the latest addition to the herd.

27:37.137 --> 27:40.493
Ganbold gives thanks for his good fortune.

27:46.097 --> 27:51.729
Unlike the Gobi, there are some deserts
where water never exists.

27:52.977 --> 27:59.246
In the Chilean Atacama desert, some areas
are as desolate as the surface of Mars.

27:59.297 --> 28:03.370
This is the driest place on Earth.

28:05.617 --> 28:12.011
Here people have been inspired by nature
to conjure water from thin air.

28:14.297 --> 28:18.848
Cactus flowers are a source of food
for the guanacos,

28:18.897 --> 28:21.172
the wild camels of South America.

28:22.217 --> 28:27.575
But these cacti are also the key
to their water supply.

28:27.617 --> 28:32.054
They're covered in furry lichen,
which traps any moisture in the air.

28:34.297 --> 28:39.530
Orlando has taken inspiration
from the cacti's natural solution.

28:39.577 --> 28:44.651
With his friends,
he erects a vast net six metres high.

29:01.017 --> 29:05.647
The net's mesh is designed
to mimic the lichen hairs,

29:05.697 --> 29:09.246
because in this coastal strip
of the Atacama desert

29:09.297 --> 29:14.246
they have a lifeline to moisture -
the Pacific Ocean.

29:17.697 --> 29:21.372
Here, cold sea currents cool
the hot desert air

29:21.417 --> 29:23.977
and produce huge fog blankets.

29:31.817 --> 29:34.456
The fog is sucked ashore...

29:35.577 --> 29:38.455
...and sweeps over the cacti...

29:39.857 --> 29:43.247
...and also Orlando's nets.

29:47.097 --> 29:52.217
When the fog hits the cacti,
it condenses onto the lichen hairs,

29:52.257 --> 29:54.691
which capture the precious water.

29:58.457 --> 30:02.006
In no time,
the cacti are dripping with dew.

30:08.177 --> 30:11.931
On the nets, the fog does
exactly the same.

30:11.977 --> 30:17.005
Drop by precious drop, this miracle water
is channelled to a reservoir.

30:43.337 --> 30:49.128
Each day, these magical nets produce
nearly 500 litres of water...

30:50.457 --> 30:54.006
...which allows Orlando to nurture
a few plants in the sand.

30:54.057 --> 30:57.367
But he has bigger ideas.

31:07.097 --> 31:09.088
This is just the latest innovation

31:09.137 --> 31:13.096
in the eternal human quest
to find water in the desert.

31:17.857 --> 31:21.008
Around the world,
signs are etched in the landscape.

31:21.057 --> 31:24.493
Scars show where water used to flow.

31:25.737 --> 31:31.289
7,000 years ago, the Sahara was crossed
by a network of rivers and lakes,

31:31.337 --> 31:34.056
which disappeared as it turned to desert.

31:35.057 --> 31:39.847
Yet, in this now barren land,
some of this water remains

31:39.897 --> 31:42.252
deep in rocks underground.

31:46.537 --> 31:49.449
In Ba'amar, central Algeria,

31:49.497 --> 31:53.570
their extraordinary skill
is to tap into this ancient water.

31:55.297 --> 31:58.130
But you have to know how to harness it.

31:59.697 --> 32:04.976
Mafourdi is 70 years old,
and committed to a life in the desert.

32:10.857 --> 32:16.489
Every morning after prayer,
the men head off to find water.

32:19.057 --> 32:24.734
With stubborn devotion and very
simple tools, they have dug a well.

32:26.777 --> 32:31.567
It's taken them six months to carve out
a shaft through the desert rock.

32:31.617 --> 32:35.166
Only now are they ready
for their most dangerous mission.

32:39.777 --> 32:44.851
As the oldest and the most experienced,
Mafourdi climbs down alone.

32:44.897 --> 32:48.014
It's a sheer nine-metre drop.

33:16.297 --> 33:21.052
At the bottom lies knee-deep water
in hand-dug passages.

33:21.097 --> 33:25.329
Mafourdi knows they are vital
to keep the water supply flowing.

33:26.497 --> 33:31.730
But many men have been buried alive
down here, when the walls have collapsed.

33:34.777 --> 33:38.008
The water seeps from the rocks themselves.

33:39.897 --> 33:45.335
Mafourdi has released it from
thousands of years trapped in the rock.

33:45.377 --> 33:47.447
This ancient water

33:47.497 --> 33:51.126
is all that's left of the rivers
that used to flow across the land above.

34:02.817 --> 34:05.377
But one well isn't enough.

34:05.417 --> 34:07.647
The real trick is to connect several wells

34:07.697 --> 34:11.531
and create
an underground channel of water.

34:16.777 --> 34:20.531
Mafourdi's neighbour, Abdullah,
has also been digging a well

34:20.577 --> 34:22.533
for the last six months.

34:22.577 --> 34:25.171
Today's the day they're going to join up.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.450
But Abdullah must leave Mafourdi.

34:40.497 --> 34:44.012
Joining the tunnels
is the most dangerous part.

34:47.137 --> 34:51.369
With so much earth removed, 30 foot
of rock could collapse at any moment.

34:51.417 --> 34:54.614
It would crush Mafourdi,
with no hope of escape.

35:00.577 --> 35:04.206
Back at the surface,
Abdullah prays for Mafourdi.

35:31.137 --> 35:34.049
Finally, Mafourdi has broken through.

35:34.097 --> 35:36.247
But will the walls hold?

36:05.417 --> 36:10.286
This new channel is just part
of a much bigger system.

36:10.337 --> 36:13.090
Every generation for the last 700 years

36:13.137 --> 36:16.493
has been digging new wells
and connecting them up.

36:19.657 --> 36:23.332
There are over 800 wells here now,

36:23.377 --> 36:27.370
channelling water
60 kilometres under the desert floor.

36:30.017 --> 36:35.489
The passages are cut so that the water
continually runs slightly downhill.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.857
When it reaches the surface,
it's divided up

36:40.897 --> 36:44.572
to sustain a village
that otherwise wouldn't exist.

36:50.057 --> 36:55.609
With his share of the water, Mafourdi
has created an oasis to grow date palms.

37:00.497 --> 37:04.775
And this attracts
all sorts of surprising visitors.

37:17.297 --> 37:22.451
Once you have a permanent water supply,
anything's possible.

37:25.457 --> 37:27.493
In America's state of Nevada,

37:27.537 --> 37:30.768
Las Vegas pushes desert living
to the extreme.

37:31.977 --> 37:35.413
It breaks all the rules.

37:35.457 --> 37:38.733
It is one of the fastest growing cities
in the US,

37:38.777 --> 37:42.292
using more water per person
than almost anywhere else in the world.

37:42.337 --> 37:47.730
Is this humanity realising
an impossible dream?

37:47.777 --> 37:50.575
Or is it just a neon mirage?

37:55.177 --> 38:00.126
The deserts of the world are littered with
ruins of boom-and-bust civilisations

38:00.177 --> 38:02.054
where the water ran out.

38:05.057 --> 38:09.733
Petra in Jordan was an ancient city
which once had an aqueduct system

38:09.777 --> 38:14.805
delivering 40 million litres of water
a day to 20,000 people.

38:22.537 --> 38:27.213
For most desert dwellers,
life revolves around the meagre rains.

38:28.297 --> 38:32.654
Only with rain can they hope
to survive the next blazing year.

38:34.497 --> 38:38.649
But in Mali, desert rains are
anything but reliable.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.571
Some years, they don't come at all.

38:49.137 --> 38:52.334
But if they do,
the villagers know they come violently

38:52.377 --> 38:55.687
so they must make their granaries
watertight.

39:02.017 --> 39:05.407
The rains are preceded by sandstorms,

39:05.457 --> 39:10.531
so now people watch the skies,
waiting for a rampaging wall of dust.

39:19.017 --> 39:24.045
At 50 kilometres wide, and advancing
at a speed of 1 00 kilometres an hour,

39:24.097 --> 39:27.487
the sandstorm engulfs the village
in minutes.

39:59.577 --> 40:03.490
But people know
this darkness is ultimately a good sign.

40:10.257 --> 40:12.009
Finally the rain is unleashed.

40:12.057 --> 40:16.414
1 5 centimetres falls in 20 minutes,

40:16.457 --> 40:20.530
turning the desert into
a network of streams.

40:25.057 --> 40:29.494
Having waited all year,
it's suddenly a moment to rejoice.

41:06.417 --> 41:11.332
In deserts across the world,
rains transform the landscape.

41:14.937 --> 41:19.931
This is the one moment when life is
no longer about the quest for water.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.093
The pressure's off.

41:28.297 --> 41:31.573
For the Wodaabe people
of Niger, West Africa,

41:31.617 --> 41:35.007
this is their window of opportunity
for love.

41:41.297 --> 41:43.367
When the rains are good enough,

41:43.417 --> 41:46.727
they can abandon
their normally isolated lives.

41:46.777 --> 41:50.247
There's enough food and water
to support a few hundred Wodaabe

41:50.297 --> 41:54.290
coming together for one of
the most extraordinary gatherings

41:54.337 --> 41:57.170
of fertility and flirtation in the world.

42:00.537 --> 42:04.052
In this hive of activity is Djao.

42:04.097 --> 42:09.046
He's walked 80 kilometres to be here,
for a contest called Gerewol.

42:10.137 --> 42:13.095
It's a courtship dance for sex.

42:14.137 --> 42:17.095
Winning means he'll get a new lover.

42:33.937 --> 42:35.689
This year is special.

42:35.737 --> 42:39.935
It's the first Gerewol
after six years of drought,

42:39.977 --> 42:43.253
so expectations are running high.

42:45.337 --> 42:51.572
Djao is already married,
and his wife Tembe is here too.

42:51.617 --> 42:54.734
Indeed, this festival
is full of married couples.

42:54.777 --> 42:57.655
Wodaabe culture allows both men and women

42:57.697 --> 43:02.566
to set aside their marriage vows
without stigma for these few days.

43:04.257 --> 43:07.567
Tembe is up for a fling herself.

43:16.617 --> 43:21.293
But she knows
her husband is also a great catch.

43:40.297 --> 43:44.176
But, for this flirting contest,
it's the women who choose

43:44.217 --> 43:48.335
and, surprisingly, the men who dress up.

43:55.017 --> 44:00.455
Djao's beauty, dancing and singing
will be scrutinised.

44:00.497 --> 44:03.648
His big performance is just hours away.

44:11.737 --> 44:16.049
The men decorate themselves
with coloured clays from the desert...

44:17.657 --> 44:23.414
...with the crushed, charred bones
of egrets for their black lipstick,

44:23.457 --> 44:28.975
and with perfumes from desert plants
to make themselves irresistible.

44:31.497 --> 44:34.534
It's time for Djao to face the music.

44:51.897 --> 44:56.766
The men come under close scrutiny
from an opinionated crowd.

45:04.177 --> 45:08.216
As one line of dancers leave,
Djao steps into the arena.

45:08.257 --> 45:11.806
He's desperate to be chosen
by one of the three girl judges

45:11.857 --> 45:13.529
for a night of desert passion.

45:19.737 --> 45:23.207
The girls are looking for specific things.

45:23.257 --> 45:27.045
He must keep great poise, like an egret.

45:27.097 --> 45:31.056
He must show his teeth,
flutter his lips and sing from his throat.

45:31.097 --> 45:33.167
He must dance in time

45:33.217 --> 45:36.892
and use his shoulders
to keep his position in the line.

46:03.417 --> 46:06.295
The pressure's on for Djao.

46:06.337 --> 46:10.933
Any slip now, and he'll lose
what he's waited seven years for.

46:18.377 --> 46:22.689
After five hours,
it's the moment of truth.

46:28.377 --> 46:31.130
All three judges approach
to choose their champions.

46:39.497 --> 46:41.169
The first walks up the line

46:41.217 --> 46:45.847
and, with a subtle gesture,
indicates the man of her dreams.

46:49.897 --> 46:52.809
But she doesn't choose Djao.

46:54.817 --> 46:57.490
Neither does the second.

47:01.737 --> 47:03.773
Nor the third.

47:06.617 --> 47:08.653
Djao has missed his chance.

47:08.697 --> 47:12.292
His best efforts weren't enough
to win a lover.

47:14.097 --> 47:18.807
It'll be at least a year before he has
the opportunity to dance again.

47:27.897 --> 47:30.206
Tembe is looking for Djao.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.851
Many new couples are hanging out,

47:34.897 --> 47:38.572
but at least Djao and Tembe
still have each other.

47:47.537 --> 47:52.452
So, the men and women disperse,
some with new lovers, some with old,

47:52.497 --> 47:57.696
but all have been touched
by the flush of fertility and community

47:57.737 --> 48:01.446
before they return
to the isolation of the desert.

48:17.577 --> 48:21.934
Deserts are landscapes
of brutal simplicity.

48:21.977 --> 48:25.936
They provide so little and demand so much.

48:29.177 --> 48:31.372
But, with courage,

48:31.417 --> 48:35.535
with endurance and intelligence...

48:36.937 --> 48:39.770
...with devotion and ingenuity...

48:40.817 --> 48:46.369
...desert people have found ways
to conjure life from so little water.

48:57.097 --> 49:03.491
Against the odds, they have turned
a life of thirst into a thirst for life.

49:23.097 --> 49:26.567
The only way to reveal
the truly epic nature

49:26.617 --> 49:30.246
of the Tubu women's Sahara crossing
was to film from the air.

49:35.177 --> 49:39.011
The best tool for this job
was a Cinebulle -

49:39.057 --> 49:42.254
a hot-air balloon with a small motor.

49:42.297 --> 49:46.813
But temperamental technology
and cantankerous camels

49:46.857 --> 49:51.248
combined to make this
the hardest desert shoot of all.

49:57.297 --> 50:00.095
It took three days of hard driving

50:00.137 --> 50:04.528
before cameraman Toby Strong and the crew
could reach the women and start filming.

50:08.657 --> 50:10.773
Driving in the desert, it's so difficult.

50:10.817 --> 50:12.296
You've got all these ridges, troughs.

50:12.337 --> 50:15.773
The guys are going down stuff like this
and we're getting stuck all the time.

50:15.817 --> 50:18.650
That means everyone stopping,
everyone out.

50:18.697 --> 50:22.292
It's frustrating, but it's the nature
of the beast. We're here in the desert.

50:25.177 --> 50:29.932
They reach the launch site
and start assembling the Cinebulle.

50:29.977 --> 50:32.889
Dany Cleyet-Marrel designed it
specifically for filming.

50:34.177 --> 50:37.487
With only a small engine,
it flies best in the cool morning air

50:37.537 --> 50:40.290
with no more than a light breeze.

50:46.737 --> 50:49.126
This is my first time up in a...
in a Cinebulle.

50:49.177 --> 50:52.533
I've got two friends, two cameramen,
who've been up in this.

50:52.577 --> 50:55.569
The first one, they crashed into a tree,

50:55.617 --> 51:01.249
and on the second occasion,
that caught fire, the actual engine.

51:03.097 --> 51:04.735
What I think we're gonna do is go up,

51:04.777 --> 51:07.416
and I might have lied a little bit
about how heavy I am,

51:07.457 --> 51:09.891
so we might find out
that he needs a little more gas.

51:09.937 --> 51:12.326
Kind of a bit of test flight, like that.

51:12.377 --> 51:17.371
But the camels haven't read the schedule
and they've gone to the four corners.

51:17.417 --> 51:21.535
Every night, the camels are released
to search for food.

51:21.577 --> 51:26.526
So, each morning, it takes time
to round them up again.

51:26.577 --> 51:29.774
OK, we have to go, we have to go.
It will be too late after.

51:31.657 --> 51:34.330
When the camels are finally ready,

51:34.377 --> 51:38.450
Toby and Dany set off
to film the women loading up.

51:38.497 --> 51:40.965
But the shoot doesn't go well.

51:42.897 --> 51:45.286
What happened was, the balloon took off,

51:45.337 --> 51:49.455
the butane gas has been cold overnight,
and the burner was cutting out.

51:50.657 --> 51:52.852
They almost came down
within the women and the camels.

51:54.817 --> 51:59.174
And then the balloon came down,
bounced, took off again,

51:59.217 --> 52:01.367
completely freaking out the camels.

52:01.417 --> 52:03.328
So, not a very good start to the morning.

52:05.457 --> 52:07.049
We lost the burner four times,

52:07.097 --> 52:12.125
plummeted down over the camels,
the Tubu women and the kids.

52:12.177 --> 52:14.816
Obviously, freaked them out.
Freaked me out a little bit.

52:14.857 --> 52:17.655
So, that wasn't great on the first flight.

52:17.697 --> 52:23.215
After a few more flights,
Toby becomes acutely aware of the wind.

52:23.257 --> 52:26.215
Working with Cinebulles
is almost exactly like a boat.

52:26.257 --> 52:27.656
You've got the wind going
in that direction

52:27.697 --> 52:31.451
and, although the Cinebulle's got a motor,
you can't really go against the wind.

52:31.497 --> 52:33.965
So, you've really only got
one pop at each shot.

52:34.017 --> 52:36.326
Difficult with the wind.

52:37.657 --> 52:40.774
We're fighting the wind, engine's
rewing and there's vibration and shake.

52:40.817 --> 52:44.412
I've only got a very limited arc
to pan around.

52:44.457 --> 52:46.687
So, there's a huge amount of skill
involved from Dany

52:46.737 --> 52:50.252
and the guys on the ground
getting the camels going the right way.

52:50.297 --> 52:52.333
So, it's a massive logistical operation.

52:52.377 --> 52:55.175
In the beginning we had
a problem with the gas,

52:55.217 --> 52:57.128
and after, a problem with the wind.

52:57.177 --> 52:59.452
But tomorrow will be better.

53:03.257 --> 53:07.216
The next day, after an early flight,
they face another problem.

53:07.257 --> 53:11.250
The Tubu women don't hang around
for the crew to pack up the Cinebulle.

53:14.097 --> 53:17.772
They only have enough provisions
for a normal trek across the desert,

53:17.817 --> 53:19.569
so the team has to play catch-up.

53:19.617 --> 53:22.370
We've no idea
where our camels have gone.

53:22.417 --> 53:25.727
There's 25 camels out there, you'd think
we'll find them, but it's not...

53:25.777 --> 53:29.895
you know, you look around and it is
just like an ocean with a gentle swell.

53:29.937 --> 53:33.247
So we're just driving round peak to peak,
seeing if we can spot them.

53:35.897 --> 53:38.934
Good news, we've hit
the main caravan route,

53:38.977 --> 53:41.445
which is a bit like...bit like the M6,

53:41.497 --> 53:45.888
and even better news, there's a few groups
of camels coming this way.

53:45.937 --> 53:50.294
The boys, with better eyes than I, say
they think that this is some of our group,

53:50.337 --> 53:52.248
so it's good news.

53:58.697 --> 54:00.210
With the camels in place,

54:00.257 --> 54:04.967
Toby and Dany at last see the opportunity
for getting some really good shots.

54:07.937 --> 54:11.134
- Not so bad.
- It's nice.

54:15.417 --> 54:17.373
I think we've got some nice shots.

54:17.417 --> 54:19.931
And then at the end,
we went up really high,

54:19.977 --> 54:23.128
and to see the whole desert opened up
was extraordinary.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.496
That was a good flight.

54:25.577 --> 54:29.570
They've had some success,
but the biggest challenge lies ahead -

54:29.617 --> 54:32.177
filming the women's arrival at the well.

54:32.217 --> 54:36.335
But on a dusty night,
the stars of the show go missing.

54:36.377 --> 54:39.369
We've just been using
our big spotlight as a beacon,

54:39.417 --> 54:41.851
because three of the women
and six of the camels

54:41.897 --> 54:43.535
didn't make it into camp tonight

54:43.577 --> 54:46.808
and here in the desert, there's
a very good chance of people getting lost.

54:46.857 --> 54:50.736
Thankfully, it worked, so everyone is
safely into camp for the night,

54:50.777 --> 54:52.096
which is brilliant news.

54:53.577 --> 54:55.966
It's only when the sun's gone down

54:56.017 --> 54:59.566
that Toby has time
to deal with a domestic problem.

54:59.617 --> 55:02.575
We brought out 30-odd cases from England.

55:02.617 --> 55:05.654
One bag didn't turn up,
and that bag was my clothes.

55:05.697 --> 55:08.575
So, couldn't wait for it,
had to come into the desert,

55:08.617 --> 55:12.690
and that is why I'm washing my shirt
quite regularly

55:12.737 --> 55:15.729
in, er...my allowance of water.

55:19.097 --> 55:23.613
None of this goes to waste. This water
will be used for...for tea tomorrow.

55:25.857 --> 55:27.256
No, it won't.

55:30.457 --> 55:33.494
The next morning
is the most important one.

55:33.537 --> 55:35.255
The women are due to arrive at the well

55:35.297 --> 55:37.367
after days of navigating
across the desert.

55:37.417 --> 55:40.727
It's crucial that Toby gets shots
of them arriving,

55:40.777 --> 55:44.087
but, as usual, there are difficulties.

55:47.017 --> 55:50.646
The logistics involved
of finding where the well is

55:50.697 --> 55:53.894
and then driving the whole way round
so as not to get any tyre tracks.

55:53.937 --> 55:56.451
Dany having to guess
where the wind's coming from.

55:56.497 --> 56:00.615
The whole logistical operation of getting
right here, for this point, is enormous

56:00.657 --> 56:03.251
and we've just about managed
to get it right.

56:03.297 --> 56:05.606
We're all here, we're ready to go.

56:05.657 --> 56:08.410
The wind is perfect. Dany got it spot-on.

56:08.457 --> 56:13.656
And the camels are maybe 45 minutes away.
So, it's...it's massively frustrating.

56:13.697 --> 56:18.851
Now it's absolutely perfect. No camels.

56:18.897 --> 56:23.812
Yet again, the camels have gone off
foraging in the night,

56:23.857 --> 56:28.533
then, at last, as the sun rises,
they appear over the horizon.

56:34.257 --> 56:36.134
Everything comes together.

56:36.177 --> 56:38.611
The women and the camels are ready,

56:38.657 --> 56:42.775
and, with no wind, Toby is able
to move around them in the early light,

56:42.817 --> 56:45.854
capturing a magical scene.

57:24.577 --> 57:28.286
As the women close in on the town of Fachi
at the end of the trek,

57:28.337 --> 57:32.615
the crew can finally relax,
with their problems behind them.

57:32.657 --> 57:38.926
Nice. It was a very, very nice flight.
Nice light. Good speed of wind.

57:38.977 --> 57:40.205
We've got a problem.

57:40.257 --> 57:43.567
I thought we landed far enough away
from town to be out of everyone's way.

57:43.617 --> 57:47.166
But lurking to the horizon...and there are
hundreds of specks

57:47.217 --> 57:49.606
running this way.
I reckon we've got three minutes

57:49.657 --> 57:52.330
before we're completely engulfed.

57:52.377 --> 57:55.892
OK, I think Dany's off to, er...
intercept the hordes.

58:02.377 --> 58:04.811
Those kids must be so excited.

58:04.857 --> 58:07.087
I think Dany's got a bit of a treat
for them.

58:19.577 --> 58:23.968
To the delight of all, the crew
have triumphed against the odds...

58:24.017 --> 58:26.770
and the stubborn camels.
