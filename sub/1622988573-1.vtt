WEBVTT

01:02.450 --> 01:03.867
What?

01:08.093 --> 01:08.926
Thank you.

01:39.566 --> 01:40.566
- Hey, are you okay?

01:53.920 --> 01:54.880
Not cool.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.410
- I told you I can cry on command.

01:56.410 --> 01:57.850
It's not funny.

01:57.850 --> 01:59.120
- It's kind of funny.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.170
- All right, let's go.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.323
Okay, fine.

02:19.839 --> 02:24.839
of control in everyone

03:21.440 --> 03:22.903
So wait.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.800
So this is not your childhood home though.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.633
No.

03:26.633 --> 03:30.486
No, that's like two miles out from here.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.063
So kind of close.

03:33.270 --> 03:34.310
Wow.

03:34.310 --> 03:35.310
Oh my god, it looks.

03:36.530 --> 03:37.363
Pretty.

03:37.363 --> 03:38.480
It's in pretty good shape.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.730
Potholes.

03:42.296 --> 03:43.137
I'm kidding.

03:43.137 --> 03:45.060
I should tell them that.

03:45.060 --> 03:46.930
Yeah, it could
really ruin people's tires,

03:46.930 --> 03:50.010
which is out of consideration for guests.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.390
Should tell them out.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.780
They love feedback.

03:52.780 --> 03:53.930
Hello, nice to meet you.

03:53.930 --> 03:55.890
I am dating your sister.

03:55.890 --> 03:56.830
I hate your roads.

03:56.830 --> 03:57.663
Yeah.

03:57.663 --> 03:58.880
Yeah, that's great.

03:58.880 --> 03:59.713
That's perfect.

03:59.713 --> 04:01.000
They will.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.100
That will be the moment that they just

04:02.100 --> 04:03.857
all fall in love with you
'cause I know they're going to

04:03.857 --> 04:06.857
and it's just like inevitable,
but that would be the moment.

04:15.509 --> 04:16.535
You ready?

04:16.535 --> 04:17.690
- I'm nervous.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.609
Oh no.

04:18.609 --> 04:19.442
Oh my god.

04:20.550 --> 04:21.383
- Welcome home.

04:26.166 --> 04:26.999
- Is that good for you?

04:26.999 --> 04:28.420
You guys are animals.

04:28.420 --> 04:29.253
Yeah, you're disgusting.

04:29.253 --> 04:30.086
Hi, Ada.

04:30.086 --> 04:31.083
- Ada?

04:31.083 --> 04:32.420
I'm Ozzie.

04:32.420 --> 04:33.593
It's safe, I promise.

04:36.199 --> 04:37.699
Oh my god.

04:39.277 --> 04:41.698
- How'd you like our greeting?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.115
- Right this way.

04:43.989 --> 04:44.822
Hi, Oz.

04:44.822 --> 04:46.044
- Hey.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.164
I love you.

04:47.164 --> 04:47.997
Oh my gosh.

04:47.997 --> 04:48.830
Hi.

04:48.830 --> 04:49.663
- Hi.
- You saw my butt.

04:49.663 --> 04:50.496
- I did.

04:50.496 --> 04:51.329
Give her some space.

04:51.329 --> 04:52.162
- Okay, sorry.

04:52.162 --> 04:52.995
Wait, I don't know where it is.

04:52.995 --> 04:53.828
- Where did the ball go?

04:53.828 --> 04:55.400
Long drive?

04:55.400 --> 04:57.600
Not long enough after that.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.330
- Like I want more drive.

05:00.330 --> 05:01.560
Coffee?

05:01.560 --> 05:02.963
- Yes, please.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.540
- Well, you got it.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.920
Thank you.

05:06.920 --> 05:07.753
- Let's see.

05:07.753 --> 05:08.958
We got.

05:08.958 --> 05:11.239
Oh, we used to have the.

05:11.239 --> 05:15.060
Well, we got instant coffee,
which is awful and terrible.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.900
Or we have the Guatemalan blend.

05:17.900 --> 05:18.850
- Guatemalan it is.

05:21.830 --> 05:22.663
So.

05:23.940 --> 05:24.773
Let's see.

05:24.773 --> 05:27.858
Are you from Chicago originally?

05:27.858 --> 05:29.595
- I'm actually from Milwaukee.

05:29.595 --> 05:31.810
I'm from Milwaukee.

05:31.810 --> 05:33.440
- Milwaukee, yeah.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.040
I heard they have a nice art museum.

05:35.040 --> 05:35.873
Never been.

05:35.873 --> 05:38.513
Maybe someday I'll spend more
than a couple hours there.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.700
Hm.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.820
They have cheese, yeah.

05:42.820 --> 05:47.467
- Yeah, we've got cheese in Milwaukee.

05:47.467 --> 05:48.300
- Oh no.

05:48.300 --> 05:49.133
Are you okay?

05:49.133 --> 05:50.410
What's going on?

05:50.410 --> 05:51.940
- Oh, I was just.

05:51.940 --> 05:53.490
I just thought we were
like being really loud.

05:53.490 --> 05:54.323
Isn't that what we're doing?

05:54.323 --> 05:55.886
Like being really loud.

05:55.886 --> 05:58.626
Okay, yeah, no.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.459
That's good.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.296
I'm sorry.

06:00.296 --> 06:02.746
That was obnoxious.

06:02.746 --> 06:04.423
It's really quiet here.

06:07.090 --> 06:08.126
Sit.

06:08.126 --> 06:08.959
Sh.

06:09.813 --> 06:10.646
Sit.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.860
Nice.

06:12.860 --> 06:13.860
Let's see.

06:13.860 --> 06:16.098
They didn't get the quiet memo.

06:16.098 --> 06:17.375
Okay.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.208
So.

06:20.520 --> 06:21.853
Why haven't we met you yet?

06:27.058 --> 06:29.693
- Marissa just never really like.

06:31.302 --> 06:32.253
I don't know.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.763
- Were you serious the whole time?

06:38.763 --> 06:39.596
- What?

06:41.140 --> 06:44.013
- Together the whole time exclusive.

06:45.001 --> 06:47.484
Ah.

06:47.484 --> 06:51.530
- Yeah, it was pretty real right away.

06:51.530 --> 06:52.890
- Good.

06:52.890 --> 06:53.723
Nice.

06:53.723 --> 06:58.512
Well, we're glad that it's
finally happening meeting you.

06:58.512 --> 06:59.345
Me too.

06:59.345 --> 07:00.178
- Welcome.

07:00.178 --> 07:01.846
- Oh my god, look at this place.

07:01.846 --> 07:03.905
Oh my god, I love it.

07:03.905 --> 07:05.670
Oh my god, it's so amazing.

07:05.670 --> 07:06.990
It's so good.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.615
- Stop screaming.

07:10.615 --> 07:12.363
Gentlemen live here.

07:12.363 --> 07:14.390
Haven't you ever heard of inside voices?

07:14.390 --> 07:15.223
- No.

07:16.090 --> 07:17.770
Oz, why in the fucking fuck

07:17.770 --> 07:19.124
did you buy your
ex-girlfriend's grandma's house?

07:19.124 --> 07:20.600
It was for sale.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.433
- Yeah, okay.

07:21.433 --> 07:22.270
It's still kinda creepy though.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.310
- Okay, it's not creepy.

07:23.310 --> 07:24.560
She begged me to buy it.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.510
And basically some say I'm a hero.

07:28.510 --> 07:29.951
- Does the hero feed the chickens?

07:29.951 --> 07:32.700
- Oh, he tries, but they don't
let him close to the coop.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.346
- Of course.

07:34.346 --> 07:36.550
- We tried sneaking in last
week to grab some eggs.

07:36.550 --> 07:38.500
Yeah, didn't work.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.490
- Oh, check this out.

07:40.490 --> 07:41.530
- What the fuck?

07:41.530 --> 07:42.363
- Yeah.

07:42.363 --> 07:43.894
- You guys, take care of this.

07:43.894 --> 07:45.120
- Okay, look.

07:45.120 --> 07:45.980
Speaking of taking care of,

07:45.980 --> 07:47.640
why don't you take these ladies upstairs?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.470
Take care of their bags like a gentleman.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.974
I'm not your
squire, but I'll take these.

07:51.974 --> 07:53.368
- No, no, no.

07:53.368 --> 07:54.951
- Like a gentleman.

08:00.430 --> 08:01.846
Where were ya?

08:01.846 --> 08:03.210
I was behind you.

08:03.210 --> 08:04.750
Excuses, excuses.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.380
Oh okay.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.420
- This is mine.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.440
- Yeah, obviously.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.372
- Ada, do you snore at all?

08:10.372 --> 08:11.580
You better not.

08:11.580 --> 08:12.646
- Be nice.

08:12.646 --> 08:14.380
I'm just joking, dude.

08:14.380 --> 08:15.213
- Okay.

08:16.990 --> 08:17.823
Okay, fine.

08:17.823 --> 08:18.656
- Okay bye.

08:18.656 --> 08:19.739
Bye.

08:22.910 --> 08:24.998
- Bunk beds for a reason?

08:24.998 --> 08:26.160
I don't know.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.960
Brothers or whatever, right?

08:27.960 --> 08:28.793
- Right.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.430
I'm doing okay.

08:32.430 --> 08:33.980
Like, I'm doing well with them.

08:34.970 --> 08:36.270
Yeah, totally.

08:37.130 --> 08:37.963
You're doing great.

08:37.963 --> 08:38.796
Like A plus.

08:38.796 --> 08:39.629
Nine out of 10.

08:39.629 --> 08:40.520
- Oh, nine out of 10.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.950
That's all.

08:41.950 --> 08:42.783
Good.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.093
Honestly,
it's a pretty good bed.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.050
- Oh, you get bottom bunk?

08:53.050 --> 08:53.950
Yeah.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.763
Hope this doesn't crash in.

08:57.256 --> 08:58.490
Oh, it doesn't.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.060
Why did you?

09:00.060 --> 09:02.630
Were you wanting it to do that?

09:02.630 --> 09:03.463
Never.

09:03.463 --> 09:04.380
- Hi, hand.

09:04.380 --> 09:05.213
Hi.

09:05.213 --> 09:07.780
See, we can like
squeeze messages to each other.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.773
- Rescue me from this place.

09:12.063 --> 09:12.896
- A SOS.

09:12.896 --> 09:14.284
Yes.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.403
Help.

09:15.403 --> 09:16.980
Yes.

09:16.980 --> 09:17.813
- I'll save you.

09:41.153 --> 09:41.986
Oh no.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.104
- I brought kites.

09:45.104 --> 09:46.780
- Yeah, probably later.

09:46.780 --> 09:47.994
Looks like we're gonna-

09:47.994 --> 09:49.424
- Yeah, we're gonna play that game now.

09:49.424 --> 09:50.661
- Ringolevio.

09:50.661 --> 09:51.494
Ringolevio.

09:51.494 --> 09:52.395
Ringolevio.

09:52.395 --> 09:54.312
Ringolevio.

09:55.740 --> 09:57.640
- That's like capture the flag, right?

09:59.220 --> 10:00.053
- Sure.

10:00.053 --> 10:01.821
Yeah, exactly
like capture the flag.

10:01.821 --> 10:04.160
- Okay, who's going to explain the rules

10:04.160 --> 10:05.563
to young Ada here?

10:06.550 --> 10:07.383
Ozzie?

10:10.870 --> 10:11.703
- Well.

10:14.020 --> 10:14.853
All right.

10:14.853 --> 10:16.630
First thing.

10:16.630 --> 10:17.600
Pick teams.

10:17.600 --> 10:18.570
- We are uneven.

10:18.570 --> 10:20.360
- Oh, I've gotta be on
the three person team.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.540
- Yeah, we don't want her going in blind

10:21.540 --> 10:23.057
and with a handicap, right?

10:23.057 --> 10:24.450
You shouldn't be on Ozzie's team.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.900
He's spurned to buttering
his own teammates into jail.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.844
- Well, I guess I know who I got.

10:28.844 --> 10:29.677
Sister for sale.

10:29.677 --> 10:30.529
Sister for sale.

10:30.529 --> 10:32.234
I'm just calling
it how I see it, okay.

10:32.234 --> 10:34.410
- Okay, it's Ada, Wren, and me.

10:34.410 --> 10:35.610
- And then, Marissa and Ozzie.

10:35.610 --> 10:36.530
- We got that, Wren.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.520
Okay, the main thing is you're trying

10:39.520 --> 10:40.690
to avoid the other team's jail

10:40.690 --> 10:43.020
while getting everyone from
that team into your jail.

10:43.020 --> 10:44.810
You can retrieve your
teammates if their caught,

10:44.810 --> 10:46.240
but at your own peril.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.240
No puppy guarding.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.080
No tackling.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.350
You can daisy chain but
don't be a dick about it.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.890
Taunting is obnoxious.

10:52.890 --> 10:55.760
And if blood is drawn, the game is over.

10:55.760 --> 10:57.550
Use whatever strategy you want.

10:57.550 --> 10:59.858
And we play as long as it takes

10:59.858 --> 11:01.653
to get one whole team into jail.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.333
That's it.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.203
Oh, and bring a flair to
your side and light it.

11:07.051 --> 11:08.051
Come on, let's play.

11:10.350 --> 11:12.030
- Don't die.

11:12.030 --> 11:13.054
- Big time.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.033
- Ozzie is.

11:41.370 --> 11:43.710
He's more likely to try
and like mind game us.

11:43.710 --> 11:46.160
We could go bold if we wanted to.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.000
Should we go bold?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.820
- That has literally never worked.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.313
- Just hear me out for once.

11:50.313 --> 11:52.130
Wait, do you even get the game?

11:52.130 --> 11:52.963
'Cause we have to win.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.480
We can't lose so you have to get the game.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.313
- Pretty sure.

11:55.313 --> 11:56.600
I mean, catch them.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.914
Don't get caught.

11:57.914 --> 11:59.909
- Yeah, she gets it.

11:59.909 --> 12:01.428
We should go bold.

12:01.428 --> 12:02.261
Come on, let's do it.

12:10.940 --> 12:12.113
- Classic strategy.

12:23.178 --> 12:26.377
ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

12:26.377 --> 12:27.507
- Oh shit.

12:35.676 --> 12:38.501
- Yeah, you better run, Wren.

12:42.713 --> 12:45.700
- I didn't think you'd be first.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.550
I'm proud of you, professor.

12:47.550 --> 12:49.960
You made this quite easy for me.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.617
- This is my throne?
- Here you go, yes.

12:51.617 --> 12:52.670
- Thank you.

12:52.670 --> 12:53.970
- Enjoy.
- See you later.

13:09.370 --> 13:10.303
- Oh my god.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.860
- Okay, it's like they
always go that way, right?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.380
So we'll both charge them on the right.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.213
We go the same way.

13:15.213 --> 13:16.880
No, no, no, no.

13:16.880 --> 13:17.983
Yeah?

13:17.983 --> 13:18.816
Okay, yeah, yeah.

13:18.816 --> 13:19.900
- Yeah, we both go right.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.740
- Sure, fine.

13:20.740 --> 13:21.573
Okay.

13:21.573 --> 13:22.470
All right, I'm ready.

13:22.470 --> 13:23.303
- Oh.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.136
Come on.

13:27.058 --> 13:28.969
Woo hoo hoo.

13:28.969 --> 13:30.990
ooh ah ooh ah ooh ah

13:30.990 --> 13:31.940
- Get her, Marissa.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.483
Ada, Marissa.

13:45.481 --> 13:47.640
I got you now, dummy.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.740
Let's go.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.500
Come on, cross over.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.613
Oh, I'm on your side.

13:52.843 --> 13:54.010
You took that.

13:55.620 --> 13:56.860
- Dammit.

13:56.860 --> 13:57.693
- Knock, knock.

13:57.693 --> 13:58.780
- Who's there?

13:58.780 --> 13:59.698
- Off the jail you.

13:59.698 --> 14:00.860
That doesn't make any sense.

14:00.860 --> 14:01.693
Oh yeah.

14:01.693 --> 14:03.110
Oh yeah, it does.

14:10.567 --> 14:11.517
Oh my god.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.850
- Wren, come on.

14:15.563 --> 14:16.396
- Get up.

14:16.396 --> 14:17.229
Get in the ring.

14:17.229 --> 14:18.320
Respect the ring, boys.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.690
- I will respect nothing.

14:19.690 --> 14:20.613
- Your foot in.

14:21.707 --> 14:22.970
- It's in, it's in.

14:22.970 --> 14:23.803
- Nice job, love you.

14:23.803 --> 14:24.808
- Dude, you're not even giving me

14:24.808 --> 14:25.860
like a little bit of the log.

14:25.860 --> 14:26.693
Honestly, man.

14:27.790 --> 14:28.623
Okay.

14:33.432 --> 14:35.682
Do you have the hacky sack?

14:38.257 --> 14:40.020
- It's outside the ring.

14:40.020 --> 14:40.890
- We can't be outside the ring.

14:40.890 --> 14:41.723
- Code of honor.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.030
- Yeah, screw that.

14:45.198 --> 14:46.413
I'm bored.

15:58.410 --> 15:59.443
- Nowhere to run.

16:03.994 --> 16:07.920
What are you gonna hit me with a stick?

16:07.920 --> 16:09.513
Look, you're the last one left.

16:10.410 --> 16:11.660
We can play another game.

16:12.720 --> 16:15.833
Just give into me and
I will take you home.

16:18.498 --> 16:19.331
- Never.

16:19.331 --> 16:20.164
- Come on, really?

16:22.991 --> 16:23.973
I'm gonna get ya.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.777
Fuck, fuck, fuck.
- Victory.

16:31.777 --> 16:34.920
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:36.580 --> 16:37.413
- Oh no.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.692
Oh boy, oh boy.

16:38.692 --> 16:39.525
What do I do?

16:39.525 --> 16:42.044
- Help me get her up.

16:42.044 --> 16:42.877
- Guys, it's fine.

16:42.877 --> 16:43.710
It's fine.

16:43.710 --> 16:45.184
I'm fine.

16:45.184 --> 16:46.832
Oh fuck.

16:46.832 --> 16:47.686
Get out of the way.

16:47.686 --> 16:49.269
Get out of the way.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.843
Hey, head to the barn.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.707
Get out of the way.

17:04.707 --> 17:08.290
Fuck, Marissa, are you okay?

17:08.290 --> 17:09.123
Wren, get the packs.

17:09.123 --> 17:10.238
- Okay, okay.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.071
Move.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.955
Arthur, grab her shoe.

17:12.955 --> 17:15.020
Wren, the first aid kid.

17:15.020 --> 17:15.853
I don't know where that is.

17:15.853 --> 17:19.696
- Arthur, find the first aid kit.

17:19.696 --> 17:21.569
- No, no, guys, her leg.

17:21.569 --> 17:22.746
- Disinfect it.

17:22.746 --> 17:23.593
It's alcohol.

17:23.593 --> 17:25.542
It's all right.

17:25.542 --> 17:26.375
That's sugar.

17:26.375 --> 17:27.208
It has sugar in it.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.041
- My fucking way.

17:28.041 --> 17:28.874
Okay, okay.

17:28.874 --> 17:29.707
- Open this for me.

17:29.707 --> 17:30.957
Yes.

17:32.746 --> 17:33.914
I got you, I got you.

17:33.914 --> 17:34.747
- Marissa.

17:34.747 --> 17:37.747
You're gonna be all right.

17:38.972 --> 17:40.964
It doesn't look that bad.

17:40.964 --> 17:41.878
It's too tight.

17:41.878 --> 17:43.865
Can you not do it so tight please?

17:43.865 --> 17:44.698
Take her shoe.

17:44.698 --> 17:45.531
Take her shoe.

17:45.531 --> 17:46.364
- Take her shoe?

17:46.364 --> 17:47.380
Take her shoe off.

17:47.380 --> 17:48.220
I got you, I got you.

17:48.220 --> 17:49.053
Ow, ow, fuck.

17:49.053 --> 17:50.210
- Sorry, sorry.

17:50.210 --> 17:51.670
Goddammit.

17:51.670 --> 17:52.785
Is that too tight?

17:52.785 --> 17:54.420
No.

17:54.420 --> 17:55.920
- Yeah, all right.

17:56.836 --> 17:57.669
All right.

17:59.260 --> 18:00.427
What happened?

18:02.410 --> 18:04.860
- We were playing the game
and I was dodging her.

18:04.860 --> 18:08.240
She was running at me and
she tripped over something.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.430
Guys, she needs to go to the hospital.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.460
- We got it.

18:11.460 --> 18:12.370
We got it.

18:12.370 --> 18:14.220
- You don't need to go to the hospital.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.270
You're a Faber, yeah?

18:33.370 --> 18:35.073
We were so close to winning.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.990
We won.

18:39.012 --> 18:40.312
You guys okay?

18:42.410 --> 18:43.393
What's next?

18:44.677 --> 18:48.035
Hey Wren, got some cards?

18:52.765 --> 18:54.379
Let's work on those decks, boys.

18:54.379 --> 18:58.838
There's gotta be 52 cards in
there between the three of 'em.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.505
Ah, Wren.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.466
What do we have?

19:03.466 --> 19:04.716
How 'bout that?

19:08.157 --> 19:09.657
Hearts.

19:11.793 --> 19:14.306
- Can we just deal already please?

19:14.306 --> 19:15.163
Five, 10, jack, 10, four.

19:16.235 --> 19:17.073
- Can we deal?

19:20.111 --> 19:21.680
Be ready to ante up.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.739
- Cool, so what does this mean?

19:23.739 --> 19:25.350
What do you mean?

19:25.350 --> 19:28.000
- Well I have a black ace
and then I have a red five.

19:29.026 --> 19:30.632
What?

19:30.632 --> 19:31.465
- Rigged.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.510
- You can't say your cards.

19:34.510 --> 19:35.393
It's poker.

19:36.243 --> 19:37.798
- Right, right.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.080
- I bid a lot.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.641
How much?

19:53.641 --> 19:54.474
- I don't know.

19:56.710 --> 20:00.617
- Doesn't matter because
I am going to go all in.

20:04.397 --> 20:05.303
- All right.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.413
Straight, count 'em.

20:08.413 --> 20:10.657
- Oh, that's a really good hand.

20:12.117 --> 20:14.153
What do you have?

20:14.153 --> 20:15.353
- I just have these two.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.190
You have a flush.

20:19.190 --> 20:21.040
Does a flush beat a straight?

20:22.497 --> 20:23.883
She doesn't even know.

20:23.883 --> 20:24.720
It's okay.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.940
- Dammit.

20:25.940 --> 20:27.310
Renny.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.910
- So a flush does beat a straight?

20:28.910 --> 20:29.743
- Yes, it does.

20:31.670 --> 20:32.503
- Good.

20:32.503 --> 20:33.702
All these
chips belong to you now.

20:33.702 --> 20:34.535
- Ooh.

20:37.379 --> 20:38.883
- What's he doing?

20:38.883 --> 20:41.740
- Probably looking for something to break.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.690
- Yeah, he's just getting off some steam.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.763
- Was that a bad beat?

20:46.270 --> 20:47.320
I've seen "Rounders".

21:09.310 --> 21:11.640
- Oh my god, seriously?

21:11.640 --> 21:12.490
- That's the bet.

21:13.324 --> 21:14.278
Call or fold, Marissa.

21:14.278 --> 21:16.078
Call or fold, Marissa.

21:16.078 --> 21:18.005
Call or fold, Marissa.

21:18.005 --> 21:18.838
- I fold.

21:18.838 --> 21:20.910
- She folded.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.482
Wow.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.921
- I win again.

21:23.921 --> 21:24.754
.

21:32.570 --> 21:33.610
- Ooh wow.

21:33.610 --> 21:34.900
Ooh wow.

21:34.900 --> 21:36.700
What a hand I have.

21:36.700 --> 21:37.990
Such a hot hand.

21:37.990 --> 21:40.540
Bet you can't beat this hand, Ada.

21:40.540 --> 21:41.890
Ooh.

21:41.890 --> 21:45.140
Ooh, what a great hand.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.230
Arthur folds.

21:46.230 --> 21:47.191
- I'll call.
- What?

21:47.191 --> 21:50.300
There's no surprise there.
- I'll call.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.653
Some good action.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.010
All right.

21:55.010 --> 21:55.960
Let's see the flop.

21:56.850 --> 21:57.990
You're all in.

21:57.990 --> 21:58.823
- Yup.

21:58.823 --> 22:00.060
And I fold.

22:00.060 --> 22:00.893
What?

22:02.046 --> 22:03.680
Wait what?

22:03.680 --> 22:04.513
- You win.

22:07.032 --> 22:07.865
- Wow.

22:07.865 --> 22:08.698
- We can deal it out.

22:08.698 --> 22:09.537
No, no, it's fine.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.790
Marissa.

22:10.790 --> 22:11.623
- You win again.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.634
I found it.

22:12.634 --> 22:14.551
I found it.

22:14.551 --> 22:15.384
Found what?

22:15.384 --> 22:17.270
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:17.270 --> 22:18.483
It's gonna be good.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.243
- Come on, seriously?

22:27.243 --> 22:28.076
Turn that off.

22:29.466 --> 22:30.299
Turn it off.

22:30.299 --> 22:31.132
Never.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.430
- There's no reason for that
to be playing right now, okay.

22:33.430 --> 22:34.304
There's every reason.

22:34.304 --> 22:35.137
- No, there's not.

22:35.137 --> 22:35.970
Turn it off.

22:35.970 --> 22:36.803
No, come on.

22:36.803 --> 22:37.636
Turn it off.

22:37.636 --> 22:38.469
- What's the big deal?

22:38.469 --> 22:39.302
- Wren, turn it off.

22:39.302 --> 22:40.135
Turn it off.

22:40.135 --> 22:41.130
Whoa, Wren.

22:41.130 --> 22:41.963
What?

22:41.963 --> 22:42.903
Wren, you are going too far.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.297
- I'm not.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.870
What?

22:45.870 --> 22:50.280
Come on, we're having a
fun family Easter reunion.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.934
Whatever it is we're calling this.

22:51.934 --> 22:52.850
I don't know.

22:52.850 --> 22:53.683
What is this?

22:53.683 --> 22:54.810
I mean.

22:54.810 --> 22:56.460
Come on, we can't have
a true family reunion

22:56.460 --> 22:58.070
without playing this god awful music

22:58.070 --> 23:00.983
that she made us listen to for years.

23:03.210 --> 23:04.403
- God awful music?

23:06.400 --> 23:07.772
Yeah.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.454
It's pretty down.

23:17.351 --> 23:20.694
- It's about time you
were gonna be an asshole.

23:20.694 --> 23:21.527
- What?

23:21.527 --> 23:23.110
What are you doing?

23:25.977 --> 23:26.810
What?

23:29.610 --> 23:30.560
Marissa, I'm sorry.

23:35.790 --> 23:36.623
What?

23:36.623 --> 23:37.493
- Come on, man.

23:37.493 --> 23:38.326
- What?

23:42.760 --> 23:43.593
- Hey.

23:52.854 --> 23:53.687
Marissa.

23:57.940 --> 23:59.460
- I got you so good.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.433
- Dude, that's not cool.

24:09.700 --> 24:10.710
- Had ya.

24:10.710 --> 24:11.543
Had ya.

24:12.900 --> 24:13.900
- Do you wanna talk?

24:16.490 --> 24:20.643
- Not really, but I guess
that wouldn't be fair to you.

24:22.070 --> 24:23.263
- We can just sit.

24:44.368 --> 24:45.680
- Man, I know you're trying
to get along with them,

24:45.680 --> 24:47.530
but does it have to be at my expense?

24:48.520 --> 24:49.430
- Wait, what?

24:49.430 --> 24:51.680
- During poker you were
being kind of a dick.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.193
- I thought you were mad about the CD.

24:57.050 --> 24:57.883
- No.

24:57.883 --> 25:00.340
Wren's an asshole, but
he's always an asshole.

25:00.340 --> 25:01.173
- Okay.

25:02.372 --> 25:04.763
What does that even mean?

25:04.763 --> 25:07.590
I mean, I was just trying
to get along with them

25:07.590 --> 25:09.490
and I thought I was doing pretty okay.

25:11.920 --> 25:13.983
- Yeah, you are doing pretty okay.

25:13.983 --> 25:14.933
It's just.

25:16.490 --> 25:19.112
I'm in enough pain already, you know?

25:19.112 --> 25:19.945
- Oh my god.

25:19.945 --> 25:21.360
Look, I'm sorry.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.193
Okay?

25:23.230 --> 25:24.063
- What?

25:24.063 --> 25:25.230
- Look, I'm sorry you hurt your leg.

25:27.070 --> 25:28.326
- I'm not.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.610
I'm not mad at you about that.

25:30.610 --> 25:31.470
I'm not, okay.

25:31.470 --> 25:33.650
All I'm saying is that
I'm in enough fucking pain

25:33.650 --> 25:35.440
and you don't need to pile on, okay.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.573
They do that enough.

25:38.085 --> 25:38.918
- Okay.

25:38.918 --> 25:39.751
- Is it okay?
- Okay, yeah.

25:39.751 --> 25:41.478
- Am I being unreasonable?

25:41.478 --> 25:42.460
- I get it.

25:42.460 --> 25:43.343
I went too far.

26:12.980 --> 26:13.813
- I don't mind.

26:13.813 --> 26:15.565
Just do what you're gonna do.

26:15.565 --> 26:17.080
What?

26:17.080 --> 26:18.240
- Oh.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.073
I run at night.

26:19.073 --> 26:20.750
Otherwise I have nightmares.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.283
Not the manliest thing
to admit, but you know.

26:30.310 --> 26:32.003
Tonight's got me all wound up.

26:34.256 --> 26:35.089
You know.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.020
You know, you shouldn't feel bad

26:38.020 --> 26:40.653
about not doing anything
about Marissa out there.

26:42.650 --> 26:45.497
These things, they happen, you know?

26:49.687 --> 26:54.687
You know, I'm not sure if Marissa
really tells you about us.

26:56.570 --> 26:57.403
You know, if they would've let me,

26:57.403 --> 27:01.960
I would've adopted Marissa and
Wren the second I turned 18.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.060
Arthur, too, if he wasn't right behind me.

27:12.710 --> 27:15.890
You know, when our mom
went to rehab again,

27:15.890 --> 27:18.951
they were gonna send Marissa
to live with Grandma who,

27:18.951 --> 27:20.893
well Grandma only wanted to.

27:23.747 --> 27:24.883
She was sketchy.

27:25.984 --> 27:29.590
I'm sure Marissa told you about that one.

27:29.590 --> 27:32.650
Yeah, she collected rocking chair horses.

27:32.650 --> 27:35.674
She sold them at auction
every summer in Florida.

27:35.674 --> 27:39.350
Well, she'd lived off that
money all year, drink,

27:39.350 --> 27:41.735
and watch porn all day.

27:41.735 --> 27:45.283
Marissa would've been
miserable with her in New York.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.940
What I mean to say is that
we're each other's family.

27:49.940 --> 27:52.343
We're more than just family.

27:54.115 --> 27:56.165
I mean, that's what you're stepping into.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.300
Out of all the homes and aunts

28:02.300 --> 28:04.440
and stuff we were moved around to,

28:04.440 --> 28:06.130
those years that the
four of us had together,

28:06.130 --> 28:08.673
I mean those were the really good ones.

28:11.990 --> 28:13.240
Marissa's more.

28:14.871 --> 28:16.833
She's our favorite.

28:16.833 --> 28:20.212
And Wren, he's young, you know.

28:20.212 --> 28:22.026
I mean, he has to be the asshole.

28:22.026 --> 28:22.859
He is.

28:41.230 --> 28:42.153
She's tough.

28:43.049 --> 28:45.449
She's tough because we
wouldn't let her be weak.

29:43.679 --> 29:44.512
- Sh.

29:44.512 --> 29:45.762
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

29:58.651 --> 30:00.568
She has to be.

30:10.530 --> 30:11.580
- Hey.

30:11.580 --> 30:12.560
Hey.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.393
- Sh.

30:18.681 --> 30:20.560
- What's going on?

30:20.560 --> 30:22.223
- We're gonna get Marissa.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.430
- Get her?

30:24.430 --> 30:26.350
- Yeah, favorite tradition.

30:26.350 --> 30:28.760
We used to soak towels
and throw at Marissa

30:28.760 --> 30:29.593
when she was sleeping.

30:29.593 --> 30:30.426
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:30.426 --> 30:31.769
- Why?

30:31.769 --> 30:32.993
- You know.

30:34.496 --> 30:36.983
I don't really know why we do it.

30:37.940 --> 30:39.340
- Because it's funny, dummy.

30:40.193 --> 30:41.103
- Oh yeah.

30:41.103 --> 30:41.943
It's funny.

30:45.643 --> 30:49.220
- Well you know Marissa's
really tired tonight so.

30:49.220 --> 30:50.053
- So?

30:50.980 --> 30:53.113
- So maybe you shouldn't do that tonight.

30:54.330 --> 30:55.590
- Oh.

30:55.590 --> 30:58.113
- Maybe we can like get Marissa tomorrow.

31:00.450 --> 31:01.283
- I see.

31:02.293 --> 31:05.143
- What are we gonna do
with all these wet towels?

31:06.461 --> 31:09.220
- I suppose we'll just
have to dry them, yeah.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.350
- Wait, just don't tickle me.

31:10.350 --> 31:11.500
We're supposed to.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.333
It's tradition.

31:12.333 --> 31:13.166
- Sorry we woke you up.

31:13.166 --> 31:14.590
Goodnight, Arthur.

31:14.590 --> 31:15.508
Goodnight.

31:15.508 --> 31:16.920
- Goodnight.

31:16.920 --> 31:17.753
Wow.

31:19.260 --> 31:20.093
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:20.093 --> 31:21.340
What did you just do?

31:21.340 --> 31:23.640
- I just said wow and
it blows the candle out.

31:26.389 --> 31:28.830
- Ozzie, where's your lighter?

31:28.830 --> 31:29.663
- Drawer.

31:31.937 --> 31:34.143
- Just say wow and it blows it out.

31:36.938 --> 31:37.938
There we go.

31:43.056 --> 31:43.889
Wow, wow.

31:45.849 --> 31:46.682
Wow.

31:46.682 --> 31:47.515
- It's like he's enchanting it.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.150
- Lies.

31:53.150 --> 31:56.360
- No, you gotta with aplomb.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.193
- Aplomb?

32:01.049 --> 32:01.887
- Poof.

32:01.887 --> 32:03.241
- That's kind of cool.

32:03.241 --> 32:04.241
- Go for it.

32:09.100 --> 32:09.933
- Wow.

32:11.150 --> 32:11.983
- Aplomb.

32:15.370 --> 32:16.620
All right, y'all.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.453
Goodnight.

32:17.453 --> 32:20.231
- Ada, where did you learn this?

32:20.231 --> 32:21.064
- My mom.

32:24.730 --> 32:26.843
- Three, two, one.

32:27.860 --> 32:28.820
Wow.

32:28.820 --> 32:29.653
What?

32:29.653 --> 32:30.520
- Ozzie.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.353
- Making a wish.

32:34.023 --> 32:34.856
Wow.

33:12.177 --> 33:13.040
- Ready?

33:13.040 --> 33:14.410
- Yeah, I'm good.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.805
- Fuck, okay, let me do it again.

33:15.805 --> 33:17.000
Let me do it again.

33:17.000 --> 33:17.833
Sorry, that failed.

33:17.833 --> 33:18.900
- Good morning.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.370
Morning.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.690
- Hey, why didn't you wake me up?

33:22.690 --> 33:23.880
- You were nightmaring all night.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.960
I thought you would use some extra rest.

33:25.960 --> 33:26.860
Oh, I was?

33:28.527 --> 33:30.350
Yeah, it's
been awhile but yeah.

33:30.350 --> 33:31.530
- I didn't like wake up Wren.

33:31.530 --> 33:33.180
Don't worry about it.

33:34.070 --> 33:34.903
- I'm sorry.

33:34.903 --> 33:36.037
Thank you.

33:36.037 --> 33:37.660
Did she sleepwalk?

33:37.660 --> 33:38.784
- No.

33:38.784 --> 33:39.784
I wish.

33:39.784 --> 33:41.600
Do you want some crinkle?

33:41.600 --> 33:42.433
- Crinkle?

33:42.433 --> 33:43.266
What's crinkle?

33:43.266 --> 33:44.420
Crinkle is a little dessert.

33:44.420 --> 33:45.253
- Sure.

33:45.253 --> 33:46.580
But it's
disguised as breakfast.

33:46.580 --> 33:47.413
- Perfect.

33:47.413 --> 33:48.640
- So, you're supposed to stay

33:48.640 --> 33:50.872
in the house until Ozzie's finished.

33:50.872 --> 33:52.560
With the eggs.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.965
Oh, did he get to the chickens?

33:53.965 --> 33:54.970
No.

33:54.970 --> 33:56.496
Easter eggs.

33:56.496 --> 33:58.400
Oh, you guys do that.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.810
- Not really.

33:59.810 --> 34:02.380
- Yeah, Ozzie says it's a special treat

34:02.380 --> 34:04.327
for our honored guest.

34:04.327 --> 34:05.750
- You were supposed to help.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.140
- Whoa.

34:07.140 --> 34:07.996
- Morning.

34:07.996 --> 34:08.920
- Oh dude, crinkle sweet.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.850
Maybe if you got
an alarm clock, it'd help.

34:11.850 --> 34:12.880
That's our dog.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.193
Yeah, got him
out the pound last week.

34:16.102 --> 34:17.798
I don't know
what to think about him.

34:17.798 --> 34:20.293
Oh no, I
think he's a mixed breed.

34:20.293 --> 34:21.443
Ooh, found one.

34:27.070 --> 34:27.903
Nice, Ris.

34:34.778 --> 34:36.565
Marissa, look.

34:36.565 --> 34:38.057
Just leave it.

34:38.057 --> 34:39.720
No, I'm gonna get it.

34:39.720 --> 34:40.553
Why?

34:40.553 --> 34:41.947
It'll fester in a week
and smell really bad.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.597
Then we'll have to get it anyway.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.430
Can we just go inside please?

34:47.430 --> 34:49.580
It's freezing outside.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.900
- Just this one last egg
and then I will go inside,

34:51.900 --> 34:54.150
get a blanket, and wrap you up,

34:54.150 --> 34:56.623
and breathe my hot air on you.

34:57.558 --> 34:58.834
Yes.

35:05.996 --> 35:06.829
Marissa.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.710
I've literally just walked around

36:01.710 --> 36:03.370
this entire place looking for you.

36:03.370 --> 36:04.870
I thought you disappeared.

36:04.870 --> 36:06.540
- I'm a magician.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.373
Poof.

36:08.810 --> 36:12.160
- So, all of the doors
to the house are locked.

36:12.160 --> 36:17.040
- Yeah, I think they went to
work and they locked us out.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.021
Oh.

36:18.021 --> 36:19.430
- Yeah, it's pretty typical.

36:19.430 --> 36:23.620
Like they either completely
forgot that we were here

36:23.620 --> 36:26.340
or they wanted to just fend for ourself.

36:26.340 --> 36:27.380
- Okay, yeah.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.603
So what time do they get off of work?

36:30.760 --> 36:31.653
- Not 'til late.

36:32.932 --> 36:35.953
We can go into town or
something if you want.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.759
- In my pajamas?

36:38.759 --> 36:41.410
- Okay, why don't we
get you some new clothes

36:41.410 --> 36:43.260
and I'm about to give you the hottest tour

36:43.260 --> 36:44.690
of my hometown that you've ever seen.

36:44.690 --> 36:45.588
You ready?

36:45.588 --> 36:46.421
Good.

37:03.878 --> 37:04.980
Come on.

37:04.980 --> 37:05.813
- I can't.

37:07.274 --> 37:09.100
Why?

37:09.100 --> 37:10.063
- I'm wearing pajamas.

37:13.577 --> 37:15.494
Fine, fine.

37:42.530 --> 37:44.166
Hey.

37:44.166 --> 37:45.063
Hello.

37:46.190 --> 37:47.023
Miss.

37:49.189 --> 37:50.022
Miss.

37:51.060 --> 37:51.893
Hello.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.560
Could you roll your window down?

38:47.603 --> 38:48.520
- Let's go.

39:21.450 --> 39:22.283
Do you?

39:25.424 --> 39:27.867
Do you wanna get a hotel
room for the night?

39:29.110 --> 39:30.210
Sleep in the same bed?

39:31.460 --> 39:33.360
My own bathroom would be nice.

39:37.290 --> 39:38.123
- Nice.

39:44.189 --> 39:47.022
Everything looks so different now.

39:49.750 --> 39:50.720
This house is where Ozzie

39:50.720 --> 39:53.033
lost his virginity homecoming night.

39:57.140 --> 39:59.120
And this guy used to be abandoned,

39:59.120 --> 40:01.800
so Wren used to break in there

40:01.800 --> 40:03.430
and he would write his poetry there.

40:03.430 --> 40:04.930
That's what he said.

40:04.930 --> 40:06.193
He also broke in here.

40:07.044 --> 40:09.620
Wren was accused of breaking in there

40:09.620 --> 40:10.890
and then broke in there anyway

40:10.890 --> 40:12.330
'cause he thought he
couldn't get in trouble

40:12.330 --> 40:13.883
due to double jeopardy.

40:16.351 --> 40:18.580
And then that church looking thing

40:18.580 --> 40:21.080
is where Wren and Ozzie
went to elementary school.

40:23.210 --> 40:24.610
And what did you do?

40:26.660 --> 40:27.840
Well I
didn't break in anywhere

40:27.840 --> 40:29.863
and all my schools were
on the other side of town.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.560
- Quite a tour then.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.870
- One time Ozzie and Wren.

40:34.870 --> 40:37.970
They got all of those marshmallow breads

40:37.970 --> 40:39.420
with their girlfriends at that bakery

40:39.420 --> 40:41.520
and then they brought them all to school

40:41.520 --> 40:43.874
and spray painted them to look.

40:48.837 --> 40:49.670
Okay.

43:25.414 --> 43:26.247
- Hey.

44:00.940 --> 44:01.840
Oh ow, ow, ow, fuck.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.160
Fuck, ow, ow, fuck.

44:03.160 --> 44:03.993
What, what's wrong?

44:03.993 --> 44:04.826
- Nothing, nothing.

44:04.826 --> 44:05.659
It's just my legs.

44:05.659 --> 44:06.570
It's okay.

44:06.570 --> 44:07.470
Your legs?

44:10.170 --> 44:11.210
- Fuck, whatever.

44:11.210 --> 44:12.043
My leg.

44:15.637 --> 44:16.470
Come here.

44:23.079 --> 44:25.357
Well that was the fastest
sex we've ever had.

44:29.790 --> 44:32.163
- You can't freeze me out, okay.

44:35.910 --> 44:37.570
- How am I freezing you out?

44:37.570 --> 44:39.283
- It was accident, Marissa.

44:40.180 --> 44:41.620
I'm just trying to get along with them.

44:41.620 --> 44:43.270
Like play the game.

44:43.270 --> 44:44.820
And like meet them at their level.

44:44.820 --> 44:45.930
Okay, what's going on now?

44:45.930 --> 44:50.173
- But if I also get along with
them too well, that's bad.

44:51.907 --> 44:55.040
- This is all because I
said my leg was hurting me.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.020
- I'm trying here, Marissa.

44:57.020 --> 44:57.853
Okay, great.

44:57.853 --> 44:59.480
- But I can't have you setting

44:59.480 --> 45:01.574
these parameters around my behavior.

45:01.574 --> 45:03.270
What parameters am I setting

45:03.270 --> 45:04.103
around your behavior?

45:04.103 --> 45:06.780
- Because I am already left out, okay.

45:06.780 --> 45:07.613
- Oh yeah.

45:07.613 --> 45:08.490
Like I'm the odd one out.

45:08.490 --> 45:09.450
- Yeah, I'm sure it's really hard for you.

45:09.450 --> 45:11.680
Okay and your
brothers, they're weird.

45:11.680 --> 45:12.720
They're really weird.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.890
And they are rude.

45:14.890 --> 45:16.650
And you don't even side with me on things.

45:16.650 --> 45:17.483
- Okay, Jesus.

45:17.483 --> 45:19.163
Fuck, I get it, okay.

45:42.150 --> 45:43.600
I won't freeze you out, okay.

45:49.933 --> 45:52.266
Can you turn the TV back on?

45:53.227 --> 45:54.060
- Sure.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.073
- God, I love the weather so much.

46:22.300 --> 46:23.133
- Me too.

47:51.710 --> 47:54.313
- Ooh, it's like a double bounce.

47:56.530 --> 47:57.363
- Oh wait.

47:57.363 --> 47:58.298
Now we're off again.

47:58.298 --> 48:00.480
Now we're on again.
- Hey, Ada.

48:00.480 --> 48:01.313
- Hey.

48:04.609 --> 48:07.459
Ozzie wants us to
meet hm at the station soon.

48:08.660 --> 48:09.493
The station?

48:09.493 --> 48:10.713
- Yeah, the radio station.

48:11.871 --> 48:13.500
Yeah, his
regulars are out of town

48:13.500 --> 48:16.690
and he needs us to record
some segment for Easter.

48:16.690 --> 48:17.523
It'll be fun.

48:17.523 --> 48:18.356
- Sure.

48:20.250 --> 48:23.565
- Also, can you stay at the house tonight?

48:23.565 --> 48:26.030
They were kinda pissed.

48:26.030 --> 48:27.173
Oh, okay yeah.

48:29.310 --> 48:34.310
- But you know why we did this, right?

48:34.550 --> 48:36.000
You guys locked us out.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.220
Like we had to do this.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.690
- Yeah.

48:39.690 --> 48:41.320
So.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.663
Sorry, I thought I told
Wren not to lock it.

48:44.630 --> 48:46.560
He was trying to be funny.

48:46.560 --> 48:48.190
Well it wasn't.

48:48.190 --> 48:49.023
- Yeah.

48:50.862 --> 48:53.487
But he doesn't have to be around today

48:53.487 --> 48:56.173
and he does not know
about the radio station.

48:57.617 --> 48:59.073
- Don't tell him.

49:00.770 --> 49:01.603
- You got it.

49:07.200 --> 49:08.250
I'll wait in the car.

49:31.374 --> 49:32.250
Roll your window down.

49:32.250 --> 49:33.083
- Hey.

49:33.083 --> 49:34.250
- Right on Main.

49:34.250 --> 49:35.990

49:35.990 --> 49:37.270
- Okay.

49:37.270 --> 49:38.863
- Okay, okay.

49:38.863 --> 49:40.450
- And then just go up, okay.

49:40.450 --> 49:41.810
It's on the third floor.

49:41.810 --> 49:42.700
Third floor?

49:42.700 --> 49:43.533
- Fourth.

49:43.533 --> 49:44.366
- The fourth floor.

49:44.366 --> 49:45.821
We're gonna get some coffee.

50:27.700 --> 50:28.533
- Hey.

50:28.533 --> 50:31.210
- Arthur took Marissa to get coffee, yeah?

50:31.210 --> 50:32.490
Yeah.

50:32.490 --> 50:33.323
- Welcome.

50:37.928 --> 50:40.100
So we have about 30 minutes
before they get here.

50:40.100 --> 50:43.630
Would you mind helping me
record some local commercials

50:43.630 --> 50:44.730
before tomorrow's broadcast?

50:44.730 --> 50:46.600
- You want me to do that?

50:46.600 --> 50:48.540
Yeah, if that's cool.

50:48.540 --> 50:49.560
- Yeah, yeah.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.830
I mean, as long as I'm not
like live on air or anything.

50:51.830 --> 50:53.290
And I mean, you have scripts?

50:53.290 --> 50:54.123
- Script.

50:54.123 --> 50:55.340
I only need one from you.

50:55.340 --> 50:56.173
Cool.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.353
- Deep breath.

50:59.980 --> 51:01.810
So how long have you worked here?

51:01.810 --> 51:02.903
- A few years.

51:04.903 --> 51:06.525
I actually don't remember.

51:06.525 --> 51:09.270
And you went to
school for journalism then?

51:09.270 --> 51:11.280
- Oh no, I didn't need a
degree in journalism for this.

51:11.280 --> 51:14.002
I just knew a guy that knew
a guy on my football team.

51:14.002 --> 51:17.203
Got a job, liked it, kept it.

51:18.410 --> 51:19.870
- You played football?

51:19.870 --> 51:21.186
- Oh yeah, everyone did.

51:21.186 --> 51:23.220
- Football's cool.

51:23.220 --> 51:24.740
- Okay.

51:24.740 --> 51:25.573
In here.

51:27.586 --> 51:28.640
That chair.

51:28.640 --> 51:29.473
Okay.

51:32.081 --> 51:33.193
So what are we doing?

51:34.053 --> 51:37.950
- Oh, it's a 20 second spot
for a local rental place.

51:37.950 --> 51:39.080
- Oh, like a car rental?

51:39.080 --> 51:40.040
- No, like.

51:40.040 --> 51:41.207
No, you'll see.

51:41.207 --> 51:44.810
- So what kind of like voice should I use?

51:44.810 --> 51:47.450
- Like a radio voice.

51:47.450 --> 51:48.283
- Whoa.

51:49.556 --> 51:50.389
Okay.

51:58.010 --> 51:59.490
It's.

51:59.490 --> 52:00.900
Sorry.

52:00.900 --> 52:01.848
It's finally-

52:01.848 --> 52:02.742
- Oh wait, sorry.

52:02.742 --> 52:03.921
I didn't know you were gonna do that.

52:03.921 --> 52:05.192
- Oh.
- Just have to hit.

52:05.192 --> 52:06.025
Go.

52:06.025 --> 52:07.430

- Okay.

52:38.610 --> 52:40.140
Actually, I can't.

52:40.140 --> 52:40.973
I can't do this.

52:40.973 --> 52:43.548
Marissa can you just
take my spot and do that?

52:43.548 --> 52:44.570
Okay.

52:44.570 --> 52:45.883
What am I doing?

52:50.077 --> 52:51.674
- It's really easy.

52:51.674 --> 52:53.293
There's a script.

53:58.153 --> 53:59.170
- Yeah.

53:59.170 --> 54:01.997
I got 'em from your like
manager or something.

54:01.997 --> 54:03.143
Through the station.

54:06.780 --> 54:08.110

54:08.110 --> 54:10.010
- All right, we're on in five seconds.

54:14.270 --> 54:16.630
Good afternoon, listeners.

54:16.630 --> 54:18.780
All y'all's gearing up for Easter lunch?

54:18.780 --> 54:21.040
All the families together
counting the chickens

54:21.040 --> 54:23.240
before they hatch or whatever.

54:23.240 --> 54:25.940
Today I have my gorgeous
sister with me in the booth

54:25.940 --> 54:27.550
and we have an exclusive release

54:27.550 --> 54:32.550
of her new upcoming album
of computery music for y'all

54:33.400 --> 54:37.300
and it is called "Lighthouse",
the song we're gonna hear.

54:37.300 --> 54:39.910
Marissa, do you have anything to say

54:39.910 --> 54:41.923
to the nice folks before we roll it?

54:48.940 --> 54:50.300
- Nope.

54:50.300 --> 54:52.063
- All right, well let's roll it.

55:47.301 --> 55:48.134
- Hey, Oz.

55:48.134 --> 55:48.967
Yeah.

55:48.967 --> 55:51.420
- Can you just not ask me
anything about the song?

55:51.420 --> 55:53.880
Okay, it's just like a song, you know.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.480
- You've convinced me to
your power of conversation.

55:57.540 --> 55:58.373
- Thank you.

56:01.970 --> 56:04.930
- And that was "Lighthouse"
by Marissa Faber,

56:04.930 --> 56:08.170
our prodigal sister back
for the holiday weekend.

56:08.170 --> 56:09.003
So.

56:10.050 --> 56:11.410
Marissa.

56:11.410 --> 56:14.460
Can you tell us a little more
about your forthcoming album?

56:14.460 --> 56:15.293
- Sure.

56:16.767 --> 56:20.106
Yeah, I can give a little
sneak peek I guess.

56:20.106 --> 56:24.090
The album is called "Compass Key"

56:24.090 --> 56:29.090
and it's all sort of
about specific memories

56:29.200 --> 56:32.160
that I have of when I was younger.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.710
A lot of them are about growing up here

56:36.412 --> 56:40.060
and you know I moved to Chicago

56:40.060 --> 56:41.520
and I haven't been up here as often

56:41.520 --> 56:44.763
as I would like and I think.

56:48.810 --> 56:51.830
I think the album is just
sort of like a reminder

56:51.830 --> 56:54.790
to not make the same
mistakes that I made before.

56:54.790 --> 56:55.623
- What mistakes?

56:55.623 --> 56:56.897
You're perfect.

56:56.897 --> 56:57.900
- I'm not perfect.

56:57.900 --> 57:00.422
We did a bunch of crazy shit when we were.

57:00.422 --> 57:01.374
Stuff.

57:01.374 --> 57:03.302
We did a lot of crazy.

57:03.302 --> 57:05.210
We got into some crazy stuff.

57:05.210 --> 57:06.590
- Right, right, right.

57:06.590 --> 57:09.490
- Crazy stuff when we
were younger, you know.

57:09.490 --> 57:10.856
- So "Lighthouse".

57:10.856 --> 57:12.673
That one's about me, right?

57:14.010 --> 57:14.843
- It's not.

57:14.843 --> 57:15.920
I'm so sorry.

57:15.920 --> 57:16.917
It's not.

57:16.917 --> 57:19.293
- Well, so it is about me.

57:20.130 --> 57:21.349
Wow.

57:21.349 --> 57:22.182
It's really not.

57:22.182 --> 57:23.015
- Oh.

57:26.261 --> 57:27.094
- No.

57:28.780 --> 57:32.360
- Well, listeners, I think
I know what's going on here.

57:32.360 --> 57:36.463
- That song is about an ex of mine.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.273
- Right.

57:41.300 --> 57:46.090
Well, in recent news, a 240
year old tavern in Dublin has-

57:46.090 --> 57:48.593
- I guess, okay, I guess that song is.

57:53.240 --> 57:54.930
I think the reason why I wrote it

57:54.930 --> 57:56.810
is like in that relationship,

57:56.810 --> 58:01.810
he just didn't get me at all, you know.

58:04.780 --> 58:06.970
We were always like at
arms length of each other

58:06.970 --> 58:11.970
'cause he just had no
idea how to understand me

58:12.250 --> 58:15.363
or like our upbringing or anything and.

58:18.550 --> 58:20.653
He just didn't vibe with it and.

58:21.600 --> 58:22.433
So I wrote.

58:23.300 --> 58:25.850
I wrote that I guess as
an expression of that.

58:27.718 --> 58:30.770
- Well, not all relationships
are built to last.

58:32.460 --> 58:36.593
Okay well, the album is
coming out July 12th.

58:37.920 --> 58:38.870
- Hope you like it.

58:39.900 --> 58:42.610
- Up next we kick off the hog wild hour

58:42.610 --> 58:44.940
featuring all your favorites, KISS, AC/DC.

58:44.940 --> 58:48.173
All of 'em, we got it right
here on 92.7 WCLO The Hog.

58:51.718 --> 58:53.885
- Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

59:47.305 --> 59:48.530
- Fuck.

1:00:15.543 --> 1:00:16.376
Got it?

1:00:16.376 --> 1:00:17.628
- Yeah.

1:00:21.450 --> 1:00:23.051
Smells awesome.

1:00:47.411 --> 1:00:51.112
Your ketchup
or some of that ketchup?

1:00:51.112 --> 1:00:52.893
- Give me some of that chuck.

1:00:54.064 --> 1:00:54.897
Oh my god.

1:01:00.423 --> 1:01:01.859
- Hey.

1:01:01.859 --> 1:01:03.103
Food good?

1:01:03.103 --> 1:01:03.936
- Yeah, it's great.

1:01:03.936 --> 1:01:04.917
Thanks, Ada.
- It's really good.

1:01:04.917 --> 1:01:05.750
Thank you, Ada.

1:01:05.750 --> 1:01:06.583
I appreciate it.

1:01:06.583 --> 1:01:07.416
- It's good.

1:01:07.416 --> 1:01:08.461
The best.

1:01:08.461 --> 1:01:11.300
Yeah.

1:01:11.300 --> 1:01:12.133
- Anyway.

1:01:13.780 --> 1:01:15.703
Hang on just one second.

1:01:21.735 --> 1:01:23.035
- Bet you it's a surprise.

1:01:25.026 --> 1:01:27.004
Act surprised.

1:01:27.004 --> 1:01:28.204
- I like good surprises.

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:33.048
- Well let's stay open to the possibility

1:01:33.048 --> 1:01:34.245
that it might be a good surprise.

1:01:34.245 --> 1:01:35.078
- Okay.

1:01:38.376 --> 1:01:39.209
- Okay.

1:01:49.167 --> 1:01:50.800
- Did you make this?

1:01:50.800 --> 1:01:51.913
- Gross.

1:01:54.590 --> 1:01:55.463
Groany.

1:01:56.870 --> 1:01:57.703
- What?

1:01:58.650 --> 1:02:01.503
Wow, seriously bugs.

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:04.960
- Yeah.

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:07.910
I mean, you just kind of get
used to it after a little bit.

1:02:12.830 --> 1:02:14.065
Like this guy.

1:02:14.065 --> 1:02:16.630
I found this one when I was in the Ozarks.

1:02:16.630 --> 1:02:18.920
It was like January out
and he was still out

1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:20.433
in like plain sight.

1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:23.900
I wasn't really prepared to catch him,

1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:25.463
but you know, you make due.

1:02:27.020 --> 1:02:28.490
I found this one when I was in Newcastle

1:02:28.490 --> 1:02:30.240
upon a time when I went to England.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.683
You know, that was Easter weekend, too.

1:02:34.762 --> 1:02:36.590
It was like the only other Easter

1:02:36.590 --> 1:02:38.974
that I spent away from my family.

1:02:38.974 --> 1:02:41.550
I guess at the time I
thought I was gonna have

1:02:41.550 --> 1:02:43.410
this like incredible time

1:02:43.410 --> 1:02:45.240
and meet all these incredible people,

1:02:45.240 --> 1:02:47.940
but you know when I got there,

1:02:47.940 --> 1:02:49.810
it was mostly just like series of meals

1:02:49.810 --> 1:02:51.230
at pubs and inns by myself.

1:02:51.230 --> 1:02:53.120
No one really talked to me.

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:54.670
I didn't really talk to anyone.

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:58.153
Think I felt pretty alone on that trip.

1:03:03.830 --> 1:03:07.850
I guess I thought it was gonna be better

1:03:07.850 --> 1:03:09.523
to spend Easter alone.

1:03:11.740 --> 1:03:13.490
You know, and I wasn't really like.

1:03:18.780 --> 1:03:22.010
I just really didn't
wanna spend another Easter

1:03:22.010 --> 1:03:25.893
with my family sitting around
the table and faking it.

1:03:28.290 --> 1:03:29.410
So I guess it was good that I was

1:03:29.410 --> 1:03:31.483
like across the world and by myself.

1:03:32.530 --> 1:03:33.993
And I found this guy.

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:36.033
This cucujidae.

1:03:37.770 --> 1:03:38.703
He's perfect.

1:03:41.603 --> 1:03:43.270
Cucujidae.

1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:45.093
Perfect.

1:03:47.054 --> 1:03:48.221
- I have more.

1:03:50.151 --> 1:03:51.280
Do you wanna see one?

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:52.373
Oh my god.

1:03:53.585 --> 1:03:55.020
Melolontha.

1:03:55.020 --> 1:03:56.833
Melolontha frater.

1:03:58.167 --> 1:03:59.805
Agonum.

1:03:59.805 --> 1:04:00.638
What's that?

1:04:01.951 --> 1:04:05.555
- Sex.

1:04:05.555 --> 1:04:07.210
Sexpunctatum.

1:04:07.210 --> 1:04:08.744
- I really like this one, too.

1:04:08.744 --> 1:04:09.577
- Oh.

1:04:09.577 --> 1:04:10.410
Oh wow.

1:04:10.410 --> 1:04:11.277
- Got a sting around him.

1:04:11.277 --> 1:04:12.433
- Nasty.
- Got chills.

1:04:12.433 --> 1:04:13.659
I got chills.
- Oh my god, ew.

1:04:13.659 --> 1:04:15.253
Can you show us how?

1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:18.033
How do you do this?

1:04:18.033 --> 1:04:18.960
How do you find them?

1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:20.332
How do you catch them?

1:04:20.332 --> 1:04:21.165
- Oh.

1:04:21.165 --> 1:04:22.650
Do you?

1:04:22.650 --> 1:04:23.483
- Tonight?

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.793
I guess the best way.

1:04:28.830 --> 1:04:29.867
You know what?

1:04:32.690 --> 1:04:33.523
Follow me.

1:04:38.807 --> 1:04:39.720
All right, let's go.

1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:40.553
Yup.

1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:44.710
Ada, why do you get the big flashlight?

1:04:45.730 --> 1:04:47.710
'Cause I'm the expert.

1:04:47.710 --> 1:04:49.073
Oh yeah, this is perfect.

1:04:50.409 --> 1:04:51.700
Just dark enough.

1:04:51.700 --> 1:04:53.580
Oh yeah, I think we can
string it up, you see,

1:04:53.580 --> 1:04:55.640
on that little like doorway.

1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:56.473
Yeah.

1:04:56.473 --> 1:04:57.650
Yeah.

1:04:57.650 --> 1:04:59.163
That'd be perfect.

1:05:00.935 --> 1:05:01.768
Okay.

1:05:01.768 --> 1:05:02.863
It wasn't you.

1:05:03.830 --> 1:05:06.390
Looks a
little unfinished, Ozzie.

1:05:06.390 --> 1:05:08.640
We got plenty
projects around here.

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:10.500
Right now, I just wanna catch some bugs.

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:13.120
All right, do you mind
helping me string this up?

1:05:13.120 --> 1:05:16.276
Just tie it around the post.

1:05:16.276 --> 1:05:17.648
Nice and tight.

1:05:17.648 --> 1:05:20.370
Have you used this sheet a lot?

1:05:20.370 --> 1:05:21.259
- Yeah, yeah.

1:05:21.259 --> 1:05:22.720
Just a little higher.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:23.572
A little higher?

1:05:23.572 --> 1:05:24.405
You got it.

1:05:24.405 --> 1:05:25.430
This a lucky sheet?

1:05:25.430 --> 1:05:26.860
- Not necessarily lucky.

1:05:26.860 --> 1:05:29.589
You have to replace
them every now and then.

1:05:29.589 --> 1:05:30.422
Okay.

1:05:31.480 --> 1:05:32.510
Yeah.

1:05:32.510 --> 1:05:34.548
There you go, tight.

1:05:34.548 --> 1:05:35.536
Pull it tight.

1:05:35.536 --> 1:05:36.390
I got it tight.

1:05:36.390 --> 1:05:37.288
- Is yours?

1:05:37.288 --> 1:05:39.530
And then you see how it's
kind of billing at the end?

1:05:39.530 --> 1:05:42.410
Is there something like
some of these rocks maybe?

1:05:42.410 --> 1:05:43.760
I got these right here.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:45.110
- Sweet, okay.

1:05:45.110 --> 1:05:46.100
Yeah.

1:05:46.100 --> 1:05:49.156
Oh yeah, Kool Aid man.

1:05:49.156 --> 1:05:50.710
- All right now.

1:05:50.710 --> 1:05:51.720
Arthur.

1:05:51.720 --> 1:05:53.661
Ozzie, just shine your
flashlights on the sheet.

1:05:53.661 --> 1:05:54.610
Just anywhere?

1:05:54.610 --> 1:05:55.443
Like this?

1:05:55.443 --> 1:05:56.955
- Yeah, just not so much moving around.

1:05:56.955 --> 1:05:59.470
Yeah, one spot there.

1:05:59.470 --> 1:06:01.023
There you go.

1:06:01.023 --> 1:06:03.580
What kind of bugs show up?

1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:04.430
- Oh, you never really know.

1:06:04.430 --> 1:06:06.440
It's usually just like flies and moths,

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:09.050
but sometimes you get the
cool ones like the beetles.

1:06:09.050 --> 1:06:10.430
- Nice.

1:06:10.430 --> 1:06:12.480
And how long do you normally wait?

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:14.680
- As long as you can stand it.

1:06:14.680 --> 1:06:15.513
- Like fishing.

1:06:25.853 --> 1:06:30.853
Would you say you've waited
over 1,000 hours, 2,000 hours

1:06:31.030 --> 1:06:33.284
for bugs to show up or?

1:06:33.284 --> 1:06:34.790
- It's totally, totally worth it.

1:06:34.790 --> 1:06:36.290
I promise.

1:06:36.290 --> 1:06:38.490
- You know, if you waited
more than 36 hours,

1:06:38.490 --> 1:06:39.323
that would be like-

1:06:39.323 --> 1:06:40.180
Knock it off, Oz.

1:06:40.180 --> 1:06:41.460
- Cucujidae day and a half.

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:42.670
- Oh look, you see?

1:06:42.670 --> 1:06:43.503
What?

1:06:43.503 --> 1:06:44.460
- Little ladybug.

1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:45.590
I got so many of those though.

1:06:45.590 --> 1:06:46.423
I don't need another one.

1:06:46.423 --> 1:06:47.570
Oh, of course.

1:06:47.570 --> 1:06:49.010
So many.

1:06:49.010 --> 1:06:51.133
So many of those of course.

1:06:53.300 --> 1:06:54.133
Is there smarts?

1:06:54.133 --> 1:06:54.966
- Knock it off.

1:06:54.966 --> 1:06:55.799
All right, what?

1:06:55.799 --> 1:06:56.930
Just trying to have fun.

1:06:58.541 --> 1:06:59.374
That's it.

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:01.633
Fun.

1:07:06.228 --> 1:07:07.570
What was it?

1:07:07.570 --> 1:07:09.962
What was that song you were singing?

1:07:09.962 --> 1:07:12.783
You were singing three different songs.

1:07:12.783 --> 1:07:14.256
Wait, no.

1:07:14.256 --> 1:07:15.358
Wren, sh.

1:07:15.358 --> 1:07:16.586
Just easy.

1:07:16.586 --> 1:07:17.419
- Oh, holy shit.

1:07:17.419 --> 1:07:18.512
Who are these people?

1:07:18.512 --> 1:07:20.193
- A sheet party, dude.

1:07:20.193 --> 1:07:21.400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:22.233
- No, no, no, just wait, just wait.

1:07:22.233 --> 1:07:23.066
It'll be fine.

1:07:23.066 --> 1:07:23.899
I swear to god.

1:07:23.899 --> 1:07:24.732
It'll be fine.

1:07:24.732 --> 1:07:25.565
Hey, hey, hey.

1:07:25.565 --> 1:07:27.900
Hey pal, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1:07:27.900 --> 1:07:28.810
There's nails over here.

1:07:28.810 --> 1:07:29.648
Just would you stop?

1:07:29.648 --> 1:07:30.481
Nails?

1:07:30.481 --> 1:07:32.490
Well, I'm a nail this sheet, dude.

1:07:32.490 --> 1:07:33.323
Oh my god.

1:07:33.323 --> 1:07:35.411
I don't know what
that means, but wait, wait.

1:07:35.411 --> 1:07:36.747
Wren, Wren, Wren, Wren.

1:07:36.747 --> 1:07:37.580
What, what?

1:07:37.580 --> 1:07:39.990
Check me out, check me out.

1:07:39.990 --> 1:07:41.161
You see that movie?

1:07:41.161 --> 1:07:42.580
Toga, toga.

1:07:42.580 --> 1:07:43.561
Toga.

1:07:43.561 --> 1:07:46.144
Toga, toga, toga, toga.

1:07:50.050 --> 1:07:52.455
Wren, just give it back.

1:07:52.455 --> 1:07:54.221
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:07:54.221 --> 1:07:55.970
We're doing a thing with Ada, come on.

1:07:55.970 --> 1:07:56.803
Oh wait.

1:07:56.803 --> 1:07:57.992
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:07:57.992 --> 1:07:59.070
Hold it, wait.

1:07:59.070 --> 1:08:00.270
Lift your chin up.

1:08:00.270 --> 1:08:01.103
Hold this.

1:08:01.103 --> 1:08:02.730
- Here.

1:08:02.730 --> 1:08:03.563
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1:08:03.563 --> 1:08:05.314
- Don't worry about it.

1:08:06.757 --> 1:08:08.600
- Take his room upstairs.

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:11.090
I'll make him sleep in the other room.

1:08:11.090 --> 1:08:11.923
- Ada.

1:08:11.923 --> 1:08:13.275
Wren.

1:08:13.275 --> 1:08:14.108
I'm gonna eat you.

1:08:14.108 --> 1:08:14.941
Wren.

1:08:14.941 --> 1:08:15.774
Wren.

1:08:15.774 --> 1:08:16.607
- Wren, Wren.

1:08:16.607 --> 1:08:18.027
It's nine o'clock.

1:08:18.027 --> 1:08:20.470
You ladies, thank you
for bringing him home.

1:08:20.470 --> 1:08:21.303
- No.

1:08:21.303 --> 1:08:22.146
- All right, yes.

1:08:22.146 --> 1:08:23.401
- It's my posse.
- Say goodnight.

1:08:23.401 --> 1:08:24.399
- Ozzie, it's my posse.

1:08:24.399 --> 1:08:25.547
- You gotta go.
- It's my friends.

1:08:25.547 --> 1:08:27.050
- You can't stay here.

1:08:27.050 --> 1:08:28.050
- You can't.

1:09:14.470 --> 1:09:15.420
- Hey, can we talk?

1:09:20.876 --> 1:09:22.060
I love you.

1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:23.863
Mm hm.

1:09:38.785 --> 1:09:40.778
From France.

1:09:40.778 --> 1:09:42.195
France.

1:09:43.343 --> 1:09:44.985
What's the fire spell?

1:11:56.052 --> 1:11:57.635
- Everything hurts.

1:11:59.632 --> 1:12:00.882
Do you hear me?

1:12:02.023 --> 1:12:03.440
Everything hurts.

1:12:13.891 --> 1:12:15.162
- Hey.

1:12:15.162 --> 1:12:17.089
Where are they keys?

1:12:17.089 --> 1:12:17.922
- Why?

1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:22.067
- Okay, can I have them, please?

1:12:22.067 --> 1:12:23.067
Why?

1:12:24.464 --> 1:12:26.714
- Can I just have the keys?

1:12:28.670 --> 1:12:30.040
Why do you want them?

1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:30.910
- Do I need a reason?

1:12:30.910 --> 1:12:32.890
- Okay well, they're my keys so.

1:12:32.890 --> 1:12:34.290
Oh my god, okay.

1:12:35.460 --> 1:12:36.293
My leg hurts.

1:12:36.293 --> 1:12:37.680
I'm gonna go to the hospital.

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:39.340
- The hospital?
- Mm hm.

1:12:39.340 --> 1:12:40.531
Okay, well can
you just wait until after-

1:12:40.531 --> 1:12:41.454
- Can you just give me the keys?

1:12:41.454 --> 1:12:43.293
Can you just give her the keys.

1:12:43.293 --> 1:12:44.696
- Listen, I'll drive.

1:12:44.696 --> 1:12:46.244
Just give me the keys.

1:12:46.244 --> 1:12:47.894
- Don't leave me alone with them.

1:12:52.660 --> 1:12:54.700
Why is everyone screaming?

1:12:54.700 --> 1:12:56.640
Wren, can you take
Marissa to the hospital?

1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:57.473
- Why?

1:12:57.473 --> 1:12:58.787
I'm not that hungover.

1:12:58.787 --> 1:13:00.770
Why can't you just do it?

1:13:00.770 --> 1:13:02.140
Because I'm managing the food.

1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:03.247
Ozzie, I mean I can-

1:13:03.247 --> 1:13:04.510
- No.

1:13:04.510 --> 1:13:05.860
Oh, come on, Marissa.

1:13:05.860 --> 1:13:07.110
We're just about to start lunch.

1:13:07.110 --> 1:13:08.910
- I don't care about lunch, okay.

1:13:08.910 --> 1:13:11.210
I wanna go to the hospital
for my fucking leg.

1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:20.480
Can somebody just give
me some keys, please?

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:21.350
One of their keys.

1:13:21.350 --> 1:13:22.183
Thank you.

1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:25.613
Be back later, I swear.

1:13:33.750 --> 1:13:34.583
- Hey guys, I'm really sorry.

1:13:34.583 --> 1:13:36.813
- Seriously, we try our
best to be welcoming to you.

1:13:37.830 --> 1:13:39.630
We could've had a good
time catching up with her,

1:13:39.630 --> 1:13:41.393
but we were warm to you, right?

1:13:42.403 --> 1:13:43.480
- I don't know.

1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:44.480
- Arthur, forget it.

1:13:47.661 --> 1:13:48.494
Okay?

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.427
Let's just eat.

1:13:57.423 --> 1:13:58.840
- Let's just eat.

1:16:09.010 --> 1:16:10.733
Hey.

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:12.450
Is everything all right?

1:16:12.450 --> 1:16:13.283
- Yeah.

1:16:15.050 --> 1:16:18.650
Just gave me a bunch of antibiotics.

1:16:18.650 --> 1:16:20.180
Called me a dumb ass.

1:16:20.180 --> 1:16:22.773
Gave me this beautiful little patch.

1:16:22.773 --> 1:16:25.293
Said it'll clear up in a few days so.

1:16:26.772 --> 1:16:27.939
- That's good.

1:16:50.686 --> 1:16:51.950
- Is there any food left?

1:16:51.950 --> 1:16:53.560
- Yeah.

1:16:53.560 --> 1:16:54.393
We made you a plate.

1:16:54.393 --> 1:16:55.270
It's in the fridge.

1:16:55.270 --> 1:16:56.103
- Cool.

1:16:58.110 --> 1:16:59.003
Thanks much.

1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:17.073
- I don't.

1:17:19.704 --> 1:17:20.883
I don't get this.

1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:23.553
Fit in with you.

1:17:29.496 --> 1:17:31.746
And I think that I want to.

1:17:51.210 --> 1:17:54.199
It's kite time, baby.

1:17:54.199 --> 1:17:55.313
Woo.

1:17:56.279 --> 1:17:57.112
Here you go.

1:17:57.112 --> 1:17:57.945
- Oh, those are for us?

1:17:57.945 --> 1:17:58.778
Yes, they are.

1:17:58.778 --> 1:18:00.278
- We get the bugs.
