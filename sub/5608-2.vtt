00:04.994 --> 00:07.295
Hope you brought me
some bug spray.

00:07.297 --> 00:09.431
How come people don't get
killed in high-end spas

00:09.433 --> 00:12.134
or nice handbag stores?

00:12.136 --> 00:13.635
What fun would that be?

00:16.271 --> 00:18.240
Oh, my God.

00:18.242 --> 00:20.742
She looks about 18.

00:20.744 --> 00:22.944
Well, how'd she
end up here?

00:22.946 --> 00:25.414
Probably not voluntarily,

00:25.416 --> 00:27.883
judging by the bruising
and scrapes.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.551
She's posed.

00:29.553 --> 00:30.886
Looks like her neck's broken.

00:30.888 --> 00:33.388
I don't see a wallet
or a purse anywhere.

00:33.390 --> 00:35.457
Well, she's all
dressed up.

00:35.459 --> 00:36.758
Yeah, dressed to kill.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.093
Or be killed.

00:38.095 --> 00:40.228
I'm gonna look around.
Yeah.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.731
Can I get a couple of unis to do
an area search up that way?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.833
You two, start
an area search.

00:44.835 --> 00:45.801
Got it!

00:45.803 --> 00:47.736
Yes, sir!

Baez!

01:12.095 --> 01:14.563
We got another one.

01:16.666 --> 01:18.266
Look.

01:18.268 --> 01:21.103
Boss, we got another one.

01:21.105 --> 01:23.071
Get your guys
to bring the tape.

01:23.073 --> 01:25.407
Guys, over here!

01:40.490 --> 01:42.691
Hey, don't let 'em
come any closer!

01:43.292 --> 01:44.493
What is it?

01:55.671 --> 01:57.606
My God.

01:59.475 --> 02:01.643
It's a killing field.

02:05.181 --> 02:06.181
Jamie.

02:06.183 --> 02:07.215
Hey.
Thank God you're here.

02:07.217 --> 02:08.282
Why? What's up?

02:08.285 --> 02:09.584
He's in bad shape.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.553
He's got a couple broken ribs,
collapsed lung,

02:11.555 --> 02:12.854
and there's bleeding
into his brain.

02:12.856 --> 02:13.922
Who?

02:13.924 --> 02:16.491
They didn't tell you?

02:16.493 --> 02:19.427
Sergeant just said a prisoner
was asking for Eddie.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.368
Oh, my God.

02:29.071 --> 02:30.872
It's my dad.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.059
On first inspection,

02:51.061 --> 02:52.961
it looks like the same manner
of death for all three--

02:52.963 --> 02:54.596
blunt force trauma
to the head.

02:54.598 --> 02:57.332
The neck bruising is consistent
with being strangled.

02:57.334 --> 02:58.967
Any ideas when they might
have been killed?

02:58.969 --> 03:01.469
The first one was no
more than 12 hours ago.

03:01.471 --> 03:04.873
The other two, I'm guessing
they've been here for weeks,

03:04.875 --> 03:06.908
maybe even months.

03:06.910 --> 03:08.910
Thanks.

03:08.912 --> 03:10.679
- Let's go.
- Detective Reagan.

03:10.681 --> 03:12.314
Are we looking at a serial
killer here, Detective?

03:12.316 --> 03:13.715
I cannot confirm
or deny that.

03:13.717 --> 03:15.016
You're starting to sound
like the commissioner.

03:15.018 --> 03:16.318
Are we looking
at a serial killer or not?

03:16.320 --> 03:17.619
What we're looking
at is a coward

03:17.621 --> 03:19.387
who gets off on killing
innocent young women.

03:19.389 --> 03:20.388
Okay, any leads?

03:20.390 --> 03:21.957
Yeah, we have a lead.

03:21.959 --> 03:24.893
If he was smart, he'd turn himself in. Now.
But, Detective...

confirm the commencement date?

03:36.340 --> 03:38.306
We'll get back
to you on that.

03:38.308 --> 03:39.307
Thank you.

03:39.309 --> 03:42.911

Good evening.

03:50.987 --> 03:52.254
Hi.

03:52.256 --> 03:53.288
Mr. Mayor.

03:53.290 --> 03:54.356
Frank.

03:54.358 --> 03:55.590
The mayor is telling me

03:55.592 --> 03:57.993
I should put my application in
for judgeship.

03:57.995 --> 03:59.928
Really?

03:59.930 --> 04:02.597
Well, she's smart,
she's fair, experienced.

04:02.599 --> 04:04.466
And she looks good
in a black robe.

04:06.136 --> 04:07.335
And she'll bring
diversity to the bench

04:07.337 --> 04:08.370
as it's currently formed.

04:08.372 --> 04:09.671
Well, I'd still need approval

04:09.673 --> 04:11.172
from your advisory committee.

04:11.174 --> 04:12.574
Well, I have some pull there.

04:12.576 --> 04:14.976
And final approval
from the mayor?

04:14.978 --> 04:16.444
Erin, I hear he's a fan.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.315
Excuse me,
Mr. Mayor.

04:20.317 --> 04:22.317
She who hesitates is lost.

04:22.319 --> 04:23.752
Look before you leap.

04:23.754 --> 04:25.153
Commissioner.

04:26.289 --> 04:27.355
Katherine Tucker.

04:27.357 --> 04:28.723
Hello.

04:28.725 --> 04:30.358
A candidate who will be
losing to me in November.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.259
That will become New York City's

04:31.261 --> 04:32.827
first female mayor.

04:32.829 --> 04:34.362
Can I have a word?

04:42.772 --> 04:45.307
How's your investigation
into my husband going?

04:52.481 --> 04:54.716
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:54.718 --> 04:57.752
You're going to pretend
that you don't know

04:57.754 --> 04:59.721
what's going on inside
your own department?

04:59.723 --> 05:01.456
That'd be a first.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.458
Then it's a first,
'cause it's the truth.

05:08.497 --> 05:10.498
When I sat on
the city council,

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
I watched you tear
them to pieces

05:12.502 --> 05:14.869
any time they tried to
challenge your leadership,

05:14.871 --> 05:16.604
and now I'm
supposed to believe

05:16.606 --> 05:19.074
that your right hand doesn't
know what your left is doing?

05:19.076 --> 05:21.710
I don't care what you believe.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.912
But I will look into it.

05:23.914 --> 05:25.847
And I'm telling you
that if it's true,

05:25.849 --> 05:29.050
when I'm mayor, you can
kiss your job good-bye.

05:29.052 --> 05:32.587
Can I take it to dinner
and a movie first?

05:32.589 --> 05:34.456
You think this is funny.

05:34.458 --> 05:36.524
Yeah, kind of.

05:36.526 --> 05:39.561
You're threatening to fire me
from a job you don't control

05:39.563 --> 05:43.131
that you can't know I'd want.

05:43.133 --> 05:45.300

don't you?

07:40.616 --> 07:43.050

Aren't there security cameras

Take a break,
take a breather.

08:04.907 --> 08:07.541
Take a breather.

Unfortunately, losing it

snatch up these women

09:25.754 --> 09:27.621
without any witnesses,

09:27.623 --> 09:29.623

09:29.625 --> 09:31.791
Or trusted.

09:41.402 --> 09:43.036
Morning, Baker.

insisted on waiting.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.384
Morning.

09:57.386 --> 09:59.386
Did you order Lieutenant
Larkin not to release

09:59.388 --> 10:00.954
the results
of his investigation?

10:00.956 --> 10:05.192
Your NYPD detail is not your
own personal private detective.

10:05.194 --> 10:07.093
No, I had a legitimate
cause to order it.

10:07.095 --> 10:09.129
Then why didn't it come through
this office as it should?

10:09.131 --> 10:10.797
Because you knew
I'd say no.

10:10.799 --> 10:12.499
Frank, have you forgotten
that you work for me

10:12.501 --> 10:14.034
and not the other way around?

10:14.036 --> 10:16.203
And do you
honestly think

10:16.205 --> 10:18.271
that Katherine Tucker will keep
you on if she's elected?

10:18.273 --> 10:21.708

didn't wait to be pushed.

10:45.701 --> 10:47.467

of this office.

10:47.469 --> 10:49.269
I want that file, Frank.

10:49.271 --> 10:51.538
After I've reviewed it,

10:51.540 --> 10:55.275
and only then if there
is criminality involved.

11:01.015 --> 11:02.749

has my opponent

11:02.751 --> 11:04.985
ten percentage points
behind me.

11:04.987 --> 11:06.586
If you're running ahead,
why you looking behind?

11:06.588 --> 11:08.255
Ten points is not that much.

11:08.257 --> 11:10.490
Well, I don't pay attention
to polls.

11:10.492 --> 11:12.259
Well, could you, Frank?

11:12.261 --> 11:13.760
Could you cut

11:13.762 --> 11:15.161
your boss a break?

11:15.163 --> 11:17.197
We're supposed to be
on the same side here, right?

11:17.199 --> 11:18.698

11:18.700 --> 11:21.101
Then let this time be
one of those times.

11:22.470 --> 11:25.171
Don't make me replace you.

11:27.708 --> 11:30.243
Mr. Mayor,
I've been around you long enough

11:30.245 --> 11:33.113
to know you're going to do
exactly what you're going to do.

11:33.115 --> 11:35.081
Baker.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.483
Good day.

11:58.205 --> 11:59.906
I didn't really see his face.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.908
You know?

12:01.910 --> 12:04.344
I was... I was hit from behind.

12:04.346 --> 12:06.413
How many of them
were there?

12:06.415 --> 12:08.448
I don't know.

12:11.152 --> 12:14.354
You look so important.

12:16.691 --> 12:18.591
The uniform...

12:18.593 --> 12:21.294
You must have some idea
who did this to you.

12:21.296 --> 12:23.830
I... I don't remember.

12:23.832 --> 12:25.799
Edit Marie,

12:25.801 --> 12:28.468
I'm so proud of you.

12:28.470 --> 12:30.704
Where were
the corrections officers?

12:30.706 --> 12:34.341
They... they got there
to break it up,

12:34.343 --> 12:36.242
but they didn't
get there in time.

12:36.244 --> 12:37.977
Excuse me, Officer.

12:41.115 --> 12:43.183
Hey.

12:43.185 --> 12:45.051
Something's not right.

12:45.053 --> 12:46.186
Hmm?

12:46.188 --> 12:49.356
I talked to
the other C.O.

12:49.358 --> 12:51.991
None-none of the
stories match up.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.327
What are you saying?

12:54.329 --> 12:57.230
I'm saying somebody's
hiding something.

13:05.206 --> 13:06.172
Talk to me, Doc.

13:06.174 --> 13:07.674
I want to get this
maniac before lunch.

13:07.676 --> 13:09.175
I wouldn't count on it.

13:09.177 --> 13:10.910
Given how long
the other two bodies were there,

13:10.912 --> 13:13.113
this guy knows
what he's doing.

13:13.115 --> 13:15.148
Okay, but we do at least
know it's a guy?

13:15.150 --> 13:16.916
Judging from the amount
of force used

13:16.918 --> 13:18.585
and how aggressive, yes.

13:18.587 --> 13:20.520
There's also signs
of sexual assault,

13:20.522 --> 13:21.888
postmortem.

13:21.890 --> 13:24.124
Figures. DNA?

13:24.126 --> 13:25.091
He's thorough.

13:25.093 --> 13:26.226
Not a trace so far.

13:26.228 --> 13:27.427
Anything else?

13:27.429 --> 13:28.561
They all have
skull fractures--

13:28.563 --> 13:30.463
I believe caused by a hammer.

13:30.465 --> 13:31.698
But that's not what killed them?

13:31.700 --> 13:32.766
He strangled
them to death

13:32.768 --> 13:35.301
with his hands
after he bludgeoned them.

13:35.303 --> 13:36.536
Son of a bitch.

13:36.538 --> 13:37.937
He tied them up

13:37.939 --> 13:39.472
with rope, hands and feet.

13:39.474 --> 13:41.741
He wants his victims
to feel inferior.

13:41.743 --> 13:44.010
That's the scary part
about serial killers,

13:44.012 --> 13:46.646
that there's no motive
other than pleasure.

13:46.648 --> 13:47.947
The scary part
about serial killers

13:47.949 --> 13:49.449
is, in order
to catch these psychos,

13:49.451 --> 13:50.417
I gotta learn to think like 'em.

13:50.419 --> 13:51.418
Danny?

13:51.420 --> 13:53.420
They just found another body.

14:55.037 --> 14:57.572
The latest victim--
name is Carmen Sanchez.

14:57.574 --> 15:00.107
She's 19 years old.

15:01.443 --> 15:03.611
From Astoria.

15:05.447 --> 15:06.447
What about the note?

15:06.449 --> 15:08.082
Ran it through
the Doc unit.

15:08.084 --> 15:10.551
There were no
fingerprints or DNA

15:10.553 --> 15:12.086
or discerning marks
on the note.

15:12.088 --> 15:13.855
The M.E.'s office
was the same.

15:13.857 --> 15:15.389
No traceable DNA.

15:15.391 --> 15:17.492
Great.

15:17.494 --> 15:19.560
You know, this guy-- he's so
familiar with the area.

15:19.562 --> 15:20.761
He's gotta be
from around there.

15:20.763 --> 15:22.263
What about sex offenders?

15:23.999 --> 15:29.103
There are 1,546 registered
sex offenders in Queens.

15:29.105 --> 15:30.805
Can we narrow it down
a little bit?

15:30.807 --> 15:32.640
Maybe a ten-mile radius?

15:32.642 --> 15:33.841
450.

15:33.843 --> 15:35.343
Great.

15:36.545 --> 15:37.645
What about, uh, social media?

15:37.647 --> 15:38.813
They're all on
that social media.

15:38.815 --> 15:39.981
Any connection there?

15:39.983 --> 15:42.683
Nothing that ties these
women together so far.

15:42.685 --> 15:45.620
Maybe it's a crime
of opportunity.

15:49.258 --> 15:51.659
Why the hell did I say anything
to that reporter?

15:55.197 --> 15:56.764
You're not the reason...

15:56.766 --> 15:58.299
I'm sure I didn't help matters.

15:59.401 --> 16:00.768
There was an assault case

16:00.770 --> 16:02.003
in Morningside Heights
last year...

16:02.005 --> 16:04.906
a guy used a hammer
on a college coed.

16:04.908 --> 16:07.608
Sounds familiar.

16:07.610 --> 16:10.044
That's right, the victim
was Danielle Levine.

16:10.046 --> 16:11.579
I'll see if she'll talk to us.

16:11.581 --> 16:13.581
I'll see what I can get
from Carmen's roommate.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.882
And Danny?

16:14.884 --> 16:17.919
I know, don't blame myself.

16:27.429 --> 16:28.796
Jeffery Stark?

16:28.798 --> 16:31.399
Can't you leave me alone?

16:31.401 --> 16:33.367
Hey, we just want to ask you
some questions.

16:33.369 --> 16:34.702
I haven't committed a crime,

16:34.704 --> 16:36.237
I haven't violate my parole...

16:36.239 --> 16:37.805
Well, you're not
in any trouble.

16:37.807 --> 16:39.140
If I'm talking to the cops,

16:39.142 --> 16:40.741
it's always about some trouble.

16:40.743 --> 16:43.044
The warden at Yorktown

16:43.046 --> 16:44.979
said you were cellmates
with Armin Janko.

16:44.981 --> 16:47.181
You know Armin?

16:47.183 --> 16:48.716
I'm his daughter.

16:48.718 --> 16:51.185
Yeah, I recognize your face

16:51.187 --> 16:53.588
from the graduation photo
he kept on the wall.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.024
You never visited.

16:57.026 --> 16:58.960
Hey, listen, we're trying
to help Armin, okay?

16:58.962 --> 17:00.828
He was beaten up pretty badly
in the prison laundry room.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.363
He's in the hospital.

17:03.599 --> 17:05.566
He's real tight-lipped
about who and why.

17:05.568 --> 17:07.268
It's called survival.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.670
Look, I gotta go now.

17:09.672 --> 17:10.805
Hey.

17:10.807 --> 17:11.872
Come on.

17:11.874 --> 17:14.375
Warden can't get
to you out here.

17:14.377 --> 17:17.111
You want to know why I made it
out on good behavior?

17:17.113 --> 17:18.945
It's because
I kept my mouth shut.

17:18.948 --> 17:22.148
Now, my pizzas are getting a
little bit cold, all right?

17:22.151 --> 17:24.417
Hey. Listen, wait, you're right.
You're right, you're right. - Come on.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.252
You're right,
I didn't visit my dad in prison.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.887
And my reasons are
none of your business,

17:27.890 --> 17:29.090
but no one
deserves

17:29.092 --> 17:30.458
to get beat like he did.

17:32.628 --> 17:35.029
The only thing I can tell you

17:35.031 --> 17:37.965
is that the laundry room is
the black market of the prison.

17:37.967 --> 17:39.100
How's that?

17:39.102 --> 17:41.068
You can get anything you want.

17:42.337 --> 17:43.671
Anything from drugs to weapon

17:43.673 --> 17:45.506
exchanges hands
in the laundry room.

17:47.242 --> 17:50.911
If you want to make it
out of there alive...

17:50.913 --> 17:53.614
that is just one thing that
you don't want to mess with.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.984
Excuse me.

18:00.922 --> 18:03.057
Great. He's dealing drugs.

18:03.059 --> 18:06.260
The first time he hit me,
I blacked out.

18:06.262 --> 18:08.129
When I came to,
I was in his car.

18:08.131 --> 18:10.631
Did you get a look
at his face at all?

18:10.633 --> 18:12.533
My injuries...

18:12.535 --> 18:14.502
wiped out some of my memory.

18:14.504 --> 18:16.737
I don't remember
most of what happened.

18:16.739 --> 18:18.806
Did you recognize
anything about him?

18:18.808 --> 18:20.608
Maybe his voice?
The way he talked?

18:20.610 --> 18:23.577
He didn't talk.

18:23.579 --> 18:24.945
He just laughed.

18:26.615 --> 18:28.683
And there was music.

18:28.685 --> 18:30.618
Can you remember
what kind of music it was?

18:30.620 --> 18:32.119
Classical.

18:32.121 --> 18:34.255
Classical. Okay.

18:34.257 --> 18:37.591
It was like...
he did it to set a mood.

18:37.593 --> 18:39.293
He was into it.

18:39.295 --> 18:42.063
I've read about
these women,

18:42.065 --> 18:44.799
and I know I'm supposed
to feel lucky that I survived.

18:44.801 --> 18:46.133
But I don't.

18:46.135 --> 18:47.868
I haven't slept

18:47.870 --> 18:49.437
since it happened.

18:49.439 --> 18:51.405
I'm afraid to go out alone

18:51.407 --> 18:53.774
and I'm afraid
he's gonna come back.

18:57.846 --> 19:00.214
Can you remember
anything else about him?

19:02.417 --> 19:03.884
Even the slightest detail

19:03.886 --> 19:05.686
could help us to find this guy.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.961
I remember his eyes.

19:13.963 --> 19:16.363
They were just blank.

19:16.365 --> 19:17.965
The more I cried

19:17.967 --> 19:19.533
and begged for my life,

19:19.535 --> 19:21.202
the more he seemed to enjoy it.

19:21.204 --> 19:24.171
He dumped me
just off the highway,

19:24.173 --> 19:26.373
left me there in the rain.

19:29.144 --> 19:32.680
I've been told
he probably thought I was dead.

19:34.416 --> 19:38.252
Ironically,
that's what saved me.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.589
Well, lucky for you.

19:44.493 --> 19:45.793
My skull was fractured

19:45.795 --> 19:47.962
in five places.

19:47.964 --> 19:50.197
I still get headaches.

19:52.234 --> 19:56.303
And I'm the lucky one?

20:00.876 --> 20:04.111
So she wasn't tied up or
duct-taped like the others.

20:04.113 --> 20:05.646
No. If you look
at the timeline,

20:05.648 --> 20:07.381
she was probably
his first victim.

20:07.383 --> 20:09.016
He hadn't mastered
his technique yet.

20:09.018 --> 20:11.185
There were six months
between the first two.

20:11.187 --> 20:12.286
The time between kills

20:12.288 --> 20:13.654
is getting less and less.

20:13.656 --> 20:15.890
Have a radio car sit on
Danielle's house now,

20:15.892 --> 20:17.391
just in case.

20:17.393 --> 20:20.161
He's on a real spree.
Reagan.

20:20.163 --> 20:22.196
Your comments to that reporter
weren't very nice.

20:22.198 --> 20:23.898
Who the hell is this?

20:23.900 --> 20:25.065
Or accurate.

20:25.067 --> 20:27.968
Okay, so why don't you
enlighten me?

20:27.970 --> 20:29.937
I plan to, Detective Reagan.

20:29.939 --> 20:32.439
You called me a coward

20:32.441 --> 20:34.942
on television,
and that's just not true.

20:34.944 --> 20:36.377
Sure it is.

20:36.379 --> 20:37.511
I'm brave enough

20:37.513 --> 20:40.781
to help these women
release their souls.

20:40.783 --> 20:43.584
You should be condemned,
you sick son of a bitch.

20:43.586 --> 20:45.452
So, uh, tell me...

20:45.454 --> 20:47.922
what have you found out
about the killer so far?

20:47.924 --> 20:49.423
Why don't you tell me?

20:49.425 --> 20:51.158
He's smart.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.526
He's not that smart.

20:52.528 --> 20:54.195
He's smarter
than you.

20:54.197 --> 20:55.696
You can't even
find him, can you?

20:55.698 --> 20:58.065
I promise you, I'll find him.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.667
Before it's too late?

20:59.669 --> 21:01.168
What's that supposed to mean?

21:01.170 --> 21:02.403
There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

21:02.405 --> 21:03.938
Her name's Ashley.

21:12.013 --> 21:15.249
Please! Please!

21:15.251 --> 21:16.717
Please don't let him kill me!

21:48.829 --> 21:52.065
Does staring out at the city
ever make anything clearer?

21:52.067 --> 21:53.900
No.

21:53.902 --> 21:57.570
It reminds me there's a whole
world outside this office.

22:01.776 --> 22:04.444
I've been thinking
about your situation.

22:04.446 --> 22:07.514
I don't have a situation.

22:07.516 --> 22:09.616
I have a serial killer.

22:09.618 --> 22:11.684
You need to hand the results
of that investigation

22:11.686 --> 22:13.286
over to Mayor Poole.

22:13.288 --> 22:16.055
Katherine Tucker's husband
did nothing that was criminal.

22:16.057 --> 22:17.957
What he does in
his personal life

22:17.959 --> 22:21.327
is not my business or more
importantly, the mayor's.

22:21.329 --> 22:22.729
It is very much your business.

22:22.731 --> 22:24.197
You're alienating
both the incumbent

22:24.199 --> 22:25.665
and his leading challenger.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.634
Come November,
we've got

22:27.636 --> 22:29.102
no friends in City Hall.

22:29.104 --> 22:31.137
With friends like that,
as they say...

22:31.139 --> 22:32.539
This isn't funny, Frank.

22:32.541 --> 22:33.540
You shouldn't be

22:33.542 --> 22:34.741
in the middle of this.

22:34.743 --> 22:36.643
I didn't choose to be.

22:36.645 --> 22:38.711
Then, let me handle it.

22:38.713 --> 22:41.815
Okay, you got it.

22:42.950 --> 22:45.718
Arrange a meeting
with Katherine Tucker.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.053
What are you gonna say to her?

22:47.055 --> 22:48.188
I don't know.

22:48.190 --> 22:49.355
Frank, you tell her
the truth,

22:49.357 --> 22:51.858
it's gonna confirm
what she suspects.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.827
That Poole
is behind this.

22:53.829 --> 22:55.261
She'll use it against him.

22:55.263 --> 22:57.363
Are you suggesting I lie,
Garrett?

22:58.766 --> 23:00.200
I'd suggest avoiding her

23:00.202 --> 23:02.335
until after
the November elections.

23:02.337 --> 23:05.338
I would if I could.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.607
But we both know I can't.

23:21.422 --> 23:24.958
You're bringing drugs
into a city prison?

23:24.960 --> 23:26.693
What?

23:26.695 --> 23:27.927
Are you kidding me?

23:27.929 --> 23:29.896
Is that what you think?

23:29.898 --> 23:31.931
What am I supposed to think?

23:31.933 --> 23:33.199
Dad,

23:33.201 --> 23:35.001
will you do me one favor?

23:35.003 --> 23:36.169
Would you, just for,

23:36.171 --> 23:37.804
just for once in your life,

23:37.806 --> 23:39.806
be honest?

23:39.808 --> 23:41.040
For once?

23:41.042 --> 23:44.077
I have always been
honest with you.

23:44.079 --> 23:45.979
No, Dad!
Your whole life is a lie.

23:45.981 --> 23:48.147
You never gave me
a chance to explain!

23:48.149 --> 23:50.483
I don't want to hear
you explain anything.

23:50.485 --> 23:52.051
Because everything that comes
out of your mouth is a lie.

23:52.053 --> 23:53.553
Every single time.

23:53.555 --> 23:56.723
You lie to me
again and again and again.

23:57.892 --> 23:59.459
I'm done with you!

24:00.327 --> 24:02.495
Eddie.

24:06.066 --> 24:08.268
You have a chance here.

24:10.104 --> 24:11.804
To fix things with Eddie.

24:14.441 --> 24:18.211
I can't fix what I did.

24:19.179 --> 24:22.515
You can repair
what you have left

24:22.517 --> 24:24.918
by being honest.

24:26.787 --> 24:29.322
How'd you really
get those injuries?

24:31.458 --> 24:35.094
I didn't get beat up
for smuggling drugs inside.

24:35.096 --> 24:36.996
I got beat up

24:36.998 --> 24:39.165
for refusing to.

24:47.575 --> 24:49.909
Nicky, can I get another
piece of that chicken?

24:49.911 --> 24:51.744
Well, how many have you had?

24:51.746 --> 24:53.613
Why?
Because Uncle Danny hasn't eaten yet,

24:53.615 --> 24:55.715
and I want to make sure
that there are leftovers.

24:55.717 --> 24:57.650
Leftovers for who?
For me.

24:57.652 --> 24:59.786
Wait till you see
what college food tastes like.

24:59.788 --> 25:01.688
There's more in the oven.

25:01.690 --> 25:02.956
Give it over.

25:04.459 --> 25:07.293
Any feedback
from your panel interview?

25:07.295 --> 25:08.561
Not yet.

25:08.563 --> 25:10.697
About the judgeship?
Yeah.

25:10.699 --> 25:12.398
They don't tell you what was
said after you leave the room.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.467
Well, you'd make a great judge.

25:14.469 --> 25:15.835
God knows you're judgmental.

25:16.671 --> 25:17.770
Yeah, that wasn't funny

25:17.772 --> 25:19.572
when your brother
said it, either.

25:19.574 --> 25:21.140
It kind of is.

25:21.142 --> 25:23.276
Being from a family
of cops come up?

25:23.278 --> 25:25.845
Oh, it came up and stayed
front and center.

25:25.847 --> 25:27.814
Not in a good way,
I'm guessing.

25:27.816 --> 25:28.948
You know,
I couldn't really tell.

25:28.950 --> 25:30.216
It just felt like
they were trying

25:30.218 --> 25:32.452
to keep me off-balance
and on the defensive.

25:32.454 --> 25:33.620
Hmm.

25:33.622 --> 25:34.854
And why
would being a Reagan

25:34.856 --> 25:36.723
make you defensive?

25:36.725 --> 25:38.725
With this administration
and in this climate?

25:38.727 --> 25:39.859
Come on, Grandpa.

25:39.861 --> 25:41.361
She's right.
Cops out on the street

25:41.363 --> 25:43.463
aren't exactly feeling
the love from City Hall.

25:43.465 --> 25:45.365
Neither do we at One PP.

25:45.367 --> 25:46.566
Hmm.

25:46.568 --> 25:47.467
Well, that's just wrong.

25:47.469 --> 25:48.868
You know, you could always

25:48.870 --> 25:50.503
run for it in the next election.

25:50.505 --> 25:52.472
Well, that would be
a harder road.

25:52.474 --> 25:56.242
Harder than a seat on the bench
with strings attached?

25:56.244 --> 25:59.612
You really think that's what
Poole's invitation's all about?

25:59.614 --> 26:01.414
Well, I'm not saying that,

26:01.416 --> 26:02.882
but I do believe
there's no such thing

26:02.884 --> 26:05.251
as a free lunch.

26:05.253 --> 26:06.653
Well,

26:06.655 --> 26:09.055
I'm not calling you "Your Honor"
no matter how you get there.

26:09.923 --> 26:10.923
I'll second that.

26:14.929 --> 26:16.129
Hey.

26:16.131 --> 26:16.963
Hey!

26:16.965 --> 26:18.264
Hi, Dad.
Hey there.

26:18.266 --> 26:19.232
Sorry I'm late.

26:19.234 --> 26:22.902
Hey, boys. Hey.

26:22.904 --> 26:24.871
Hi.

26:24.873 --> 26:26.272
How's the case going?

26:26.274 --> 26:28.875
Fine.

26:31.679 --> 26:32.912
Working on a Sunday--
you get anywhere?

26:32.914 --> 26:34.614
Little bit.

26:34.616 --> 26:35.982
Really, it's fine.

26:35.984 --> 26:40.019
Maybe we should
just leave it at that.

26:42.523 --> 26:43.589
Pass this to your dad.

26:50.231 --> 26:52.665
"The first Mrs. De Winter"?

26:52.667 --> 26:55.134
"R," blank, "B," blank...

26:55.136 --> 26:57.070
Rebecca.

26:57.072 --> 26:59.872
Rebecca-- thank you.

27:01.375 --> 27:03.076
Who was the second
Mrs. De Winter?

27:03.078 --> 27:04.410
They never said.

27:04.412 --> 27:06.779
At least not in the movie.

27:06.781 --> 27:09.549
Uh-huh.

27:11.151 --> 27:14.454
It's not all about you,
you know.

27:19.259 --> 27:20.393
What's not?

27:20.395 --> 27:21.994
This thing with the mayor.

27:21.996 --> 27:23.296
You have to think collaterally.

27:23.298 --> 27:25.231
I am.
Really?

27:25.233 --> 27:28.234
And what about Garrett
and Baker and Gormley

27:28.236 --> 27:30.570
and all the dozens of
others who are tied to you

27:30.572 --> 27:33.539
that'll walk the plank
if you do?

27:33.541 --> 27:36.809
I'm aware of that.

27:36.811 --> 27:38.678
Not to mention your daughter?

27:38.680 --> 27:41.080
Well.

27:41.082 --> 27:45.151
Now, since you just
did bring it up...

27:45.153 --> 27:46.819
Look, it's one thing

27:46.821 --> 27:49.288
not to curry favor
for your kids.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.759
But to piss off the mayor
could impact Erin.

27:55.028 --> 27:57.630
I can't let that be a factor.

27:58.999 --> 28:02.001
Your call, Francis.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.288
Mrs. Juliano?

28:22.290 --> 28:25.024
Mrs. Juliano,
I'm Detective Reagan.

28:25.026 --> 28:27.426
I was assigned to your
daughter Ashley's case.

28:27.428 --> 28:29.028
I don't have any news yet.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.296
But she could
still be alive?

28:30.298 --> 28:33.966
Did Ashley tell you
where she was going

28:33.968 --> 28:36.068
before she went missing?

28:36.070 --> 28:38.371
The last I heard from her,

28:38.373 --> 28:40.907
she had just gotten
her hair cut

28:40.909 --> 28:43.242
and she was
on her way to, uh,

28:43.244 --> 28:45.645
uh, to look
at an apartment.

28:45.647 --> 28:47.180
For rent?

28:47.182 --> 28:48.815
She-- your daughter was moving?

28:48.817 --> 28:51.217
Yeah, she was going to see
a place in Forest Hills.

28:51.219 --> 28:52.418
Did she say where?

28:52.420 --> 28:53.653
She have a realtor's name?

28:53.655 --> 28:55.388
An address? Anything?

28:55.390 --> 28:56.556
No.

28:56.558 --> 28:58.357
A name?

29:00.227 --> 29:01.694
Okay, okay.

29:01.696 --> 29:04.297
Um...

29:04.299 --> 29:07.033
This, this helps.

29:09.703 --> 29:13.539
Detective?

29:23.584 --> 29:25.918
And bring them both back to me.

29:26.920 --> 29:29.455
You got it.

29:35.896 --> 29:38.064
Baez?

29:38.066 --> 29:39.298
The first victim,

29:39.300 --> 29:41.234
she went missing
when she was, uh,

29:41.236 --> 29:42.902
looking for an apartment--
is that right?

29:42.904 --> 29:43.903
Yeah.

29:43.905 --> 29:45.137
Okay, well,

29:45.139 --> 29:47.740
Ashley and Lois went missing
doing the same thing.

29:47.742 --> 29:50.076
Any of our sex offenders
involved in real estate?

29:51.679 --> 29:53.412
Thomas Wilder, 42.

29:53.414 --> 29:55.248
He got his license
two years ago.

29:55.250 --> 29:57.550
Was arrested twice
for sexual assault.

29:57.552 --> 29:59.318
Any strangulation
or anything involved?

29:59.320 --> 30:00.620
Yes.

30:00.622 --> 30:03.489
Give me an address.

30:03.491 --> 30:05.825
9501 94th Street.

30:05.827 --> 30:07.827
Hey, Danny, wait for me.
I'll meet you there.

30:09.063 --> 30:11.297
Danny? Danny!

30:11.299 --> 30:13.699
Danny!
Hello?

30:24.544 --> 30:26.846
♪

31:49.329 --> 31:52.598
♪

31:54.634 --> 31:57.003
My God.

32:08.749 --> 32:10.816
It's okay, I'm a cop.

32:10.818 --> 32:12.084
I'm a cop.

32:12.086 --> 32:13.452
I'm gonna get you out of here.

32:13.454 --> 32:15.287
It's okay.

32:15.289 --> 32:16.856
Detective 466.

32:16.858 --> 32:20.092
Detective 466 requesting
a 10-85...

32:20.094 --> 32:22.428
Detective 466,
what's your location?

32:22.430 --> 32:24.497
Repeat-- what's your location?

32:33.180 --> 32:35.348
Shut up!

34:30.462 --> 34:32.897
Okay.

34:32.899 --> 34:35.433
It's okay.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.274
Commissioner?

34:43.275 --> 34:44.876
I have Katherine Tucker.

34:46.078 --> 34:48.279
Thank you, Garrett.

34:52.717 --> 34:54.918
Please.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.521
Welcome.

34:56.523 --> 34:58.823
Thank you.

34:58.825 --> 35:00.491
Thank you, Garrett.

35:04.330 --> 35:06.297
We can sit over here.

35:06.299 --> 35:08.599
I have to admit,
I was surprised

35:08.601 --> 35:10.668
when your office
called for a meeting.

35:10.670 --> 35:14.739
Well, I kind of think
private conversations

35:14.741 --> 35:16.207
should be had in private.

35:16.209 --> 35:18.976
I guess I'm a little
old-fashioned that way.

35:18.978 --> 35:21.245
Meaning the next time I want
to accuse you of something,

35:21.247 --> 35:23.281
I should call ahead
for an appointment?

35:23.283 --> 35:25.516
Well, I'm hoping
there isn't a next time,

35:25.518 --> 35:27.485
but if there is,

35:27.487 --> 35:29.654
I'd appreciate that, yes.

35:34.527 --> 35:36.361
You were right
about the investigation

35:36.363 --> 35:37.795
into your husband.

35:37.797 --> 35:39.030
They were looking into

35:39.032 --> 35:42.734
his real estate
development foundation.

35:42.736 --> 35:43.868
"They"?

35:43.870 --> 35:45.136
I'm not finished.

35:45.138 --> 35:48.806
It was found that
nothing illegal was going on.

35:48.808 --> 35:50.441
However?

35:50.443 --> 35:52.043
Pardon me?

35:52.045 --> 35:55.947
Reading people is important in
my line of work, Commissioner.

35:58.550 --> 36:01.886
He's having an affair
with a woman in his office.

36:03.922 --> 36:06.190
Did Poole order
the investigation?

36:06.192 --> 36:07.558
Doesn't matter who ordered it.

36:07.560 --> 36:08.659
Matters to me.

36:08.661 --> 36:10.762
I can't say.
Won't say.

36:10.764 --> 36:12.530
Oh, come on, Katherine.

36:12.532 --> 36:16.000
We both got what we came for.

36:16.002 --> 36:17.235
How's that?

36:17.237 --> 36:20.471
You got a measure of how loyal
I am to my boss,

36:20.473 --> 36:22.740
and I got a sense
of what you're made of.

36:22.742 --> 36:25.510
I-I don't follow.

36:25.512 --> 36:28.613
Yeah, you do. You already knew
about your husband's affair.

36:28.615 --> 36:32.116
That flinch was just
a little too calculated.

36:34.386 --> 36:37.855
So what if I know
about my husband's affair?

36:37.857 --> 36:41.359
In my experience,
it takes a master of control

36:41.361 --> 36:44.996
to put a cheating spouse
in its own little box.

36:44.998 --> 36:48.633
You have no idea how I deal.

36:48.635 --> 36:51.135
You don't let weakness
around you

36:51.137 --> 36:52.937
sap your strength.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.974
It's a compliment.

36:57.976 --> 36:59.243
Commissioner...

36:59.245 --> 37:01.879
You might as well call me Frank.

37:02.848 --> 37:05.850
Frank, if I should win
the election...

37:05.852 --> 37:09.320
I'll send congratulations.

37:19.364 --> 37:20.965
He cooperated fully,

37:20.967 --> 37:22.433
and his testimony against
the corrections officers

37:22.435 --> 37:24.836
was corroborated
by the other inmates.

37:24.838 --> 37:26.871
So he has no direct connection
to the drug trafficking?

37:26.873 --> 37:29.273
To the contrary,
he's our whistleblower.

37:29.275 --> 37:31.342
He was the only one
willing to testify

37:31.344 --> 37:33.611
against the prison guards.

37:33.613 --> 37:35.646
I know this might be
an odd thing to say,

37:35.648 --> 37:38.082
given your
father's situation,

37:38.084 --> 37:40.151
but you should be proud of him.

37:43.288 --> 37:45.556
Thanks.

37:48.727 --> 37:50.161
Hi.

37:50.163 --> 37:51.729
Hey.

37:51.731 --> 37:53.865
So it looks like
they're gonna transfer you

37:53.867 --> 37:56.133
to federal prison, and, um,

37:56.135 --> 37:58.202
they might be able
to reduce your sentence

37:58.204 --> 37:59.804
because of your testimony.

37:59.806 --> 38:02.306
Terrific.

38:03.509 --> 38:05.676
I'm sorry, Dad, for...

38:05.678 --> 38:06.711
what I said.

38:06.713 --> 38:09.013
You know, I-I just,
I really thought..

38:09.015 --> 38:10.781
You thought I was a crook.

38:15.721 --> 38:17.688
That's because
you're right, I am.

38:19.758 --> 38:22.193
You want to know
why I stole money?

38:23.295 --> 38:25.096
Okay.

38:26.532 --> 38:28.232
I thought...

38:28.234 --> 38:30.368
being a good father

38:30.370 --> 38:32.603
meant making sure

38:32.605 --> 38:35.339
that you didn't want
for anything.

38:36.441 --> 38:37.608
Even if that meant

38:37.610 --> 38:40.244
doing illegal things.

38:43.615 --> 38:47.451
I wanted to make sure
that you didn't grow up like me,

38:47.453 --> 38:50.688
you know, with nothing.

38:52.925 --> 38:54.759
Wait, um,

38:54.761 --> 38:56.561
you're not just giving me
an excuse

38:56.563 --> 38:58.596
because of what you did, right?
No.

38:58.598 --> 38:59.897
No.

38:59.899 --> 39:02.099
I'm giving you a reason,

39:02.101 --> 39:05.236
screwed up as it is.

39:08.073 --> 39:09.774
Excuse me.

39:09.776 --> 39:11.475
My ride's here.

39:15.747 --> 39:17.248
So, listen,

39:17.250 --> 39:19.450
uh...

39:20.485 --> 39:22.653
You keep an eye on her
for me, huh?

39:22.655 --> 39:25.156
Will do.

39:34.399 --> 39:36.834
Oh.

39:56.388 --> 39:57.388
See you.

39:57.390 --> 39:59.557
Bye, Dad.

40:11.737 --> 40:13.704
Tell me we got him.

40:13.706 --> 40:15.973
Not yet.

40:15.975 --> 40:18.275
There's no way
he could've gone far.

40:18.277 --> 40:20.077
He took a boat.

40:20.079 --> 40:23.881
We've notified Harbor Patrol
and Coast Guard.

40:23.883 --> 40:25.783
How's Ashley?

40:25.785 --> 40:27.118
She's with her mom.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.519
She's gonna be okay.

40:29.788 --> 40:31.856
Good.

40:33.091 --> 40:34.358
How about you?

40:35.862 --> 40:38.229
Broken bone, a few stitches,
no big deal.

40:38.231 --> 40:39.797
He's got two broken ribs

40:39.799 --> 40:41.132
and 28 stitches.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.566
You could use a few days off.

40:42.568 --> 40:44.735
You are such a girl.

40:47.205 --> 40:49.507
I'm glad you're fine.

40:49.509 --> 40:51.942
But I'm not.

40:51.944 --> 40:53.611
Hey.

40:57.149 --> 41:00.051
I got to call the boys.

41:00.053 --> 41:02.586
They need to know
that you're okay.

41:32.084 --> 41:33.517
You're out line of duty.

41:33.519 --> 41:34.852
You're not supposed to be here.

41:34.854 --> 41:36.587
I know.

41:36.589 --> 41:39.657
I have to return this
to its rightful owner.

41:43.128 --> 41:44.995
You did good, partner.

41:49.367 --> 41:50.468
Reagan.

41:50.470 --> 41:53.637
Good morning, Detective Reagan.

41:54.506 --> 41:55.773
Wilder.

41:57.709 --> 41:58.776
I told you I was smart.

41:58.778 --> 42:00.678
I need a trace

42:00.680 --> 42:02.146
on Detective Reagan's line ASAP.

42:02.148 --> 42:03.380
Where are you?

42:03.382 --> 42:06.817
Uh, I'm somewhere...

42:06.819 --> 42:08.886
Defense!

42:08.888 --> 42:12.089
...with lots of young women
who are just...

42:12.091 --> 42:13.224
dying to meet me.

42:13.226 --> 42:14.258
You sick son of a bitch.

42:14.260 --> 42:16.127
I promise you,

42:16.129 --> 42:18.596
I am gonna find you,
and when I do...

42:18.598 --> 42:20.064
Well, you had your chance.

42:20.066 --> 42:21.732
Good-bye, Detective.

42:21.734 --> 42:23.567
Uh, just for the record,

42:23.569 --> 42:25.770
I win.
