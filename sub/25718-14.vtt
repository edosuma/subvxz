WEBVTT

00:50.508 --> 00:52.093
We're dating.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.144
Happy for you.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.188
Good luck.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.671
You asked me to keep it a secret.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.882
She won't tell anyone.

01:32.675 --> 01:35.345
She doesn't want her pride to be hurt,

01:35.678 --> 01:37.764
so she won't tell.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.603
I'm glad you got smarter.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.232
-What?
-I wanted to tell Hyun Sua.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.400
That I'm dating you.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.074
I don't want to make you lie.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.995
You don't have to lie.
I made you keep it secret.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.206
It's okay, I'll do everything with you.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.500
I'll never leave you alone.

02:11.172 --> 02:16.636
Did you... did you search
how to talk nicely?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.597
No, it just came out.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.145
Do I... have to search?

02:36.573 --> 02:41.411
Layering too many scents into one perfume
can make them push against each other.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.289
It will end up becoming
too strong and disgusting.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.793
-For feminine and chic type of...
-<i>What do you want to do?</i>

02:48.877 --> 02:50.587
...You can add citrus.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.508
If you want some lovely type of perfume
grapefruit will be good.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.636
<i>Well, anything.</i>

03:04.475 --> 03:06.561
<i>I think he hasn't messaged very often.</i>

03:06.936 --> 03:08.646
<i>But he types with even one hand.</i>

03:12.358 --> 03:13.818
<i>Okay, then, dinner first.</i>

03:15.361 --> 03:16.654
<i>Great.</i>

03:19.073 --> 03:20.283
<i>Okay.</i>

03:22.535 --> 03:23.828
<i>I'll tell you where.</i>

03:30.835 --> 03:33.963
-Haven't you decided yet?
<i>-</i>Sorry?

03:34.547 --> 03:37.967
Well, I would go
for an autumn-inspired scent.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.219
Autumn?

03:39.594 --> 03:41.262
What are you going to mix?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.641
Hmm, I think...

03:44.807 --> 03:49.187
Woody floral, or citrus type, I guess.

03:49.270 --> 03:53.441
Ah, it will go well with autumn winds.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.401
Thank you.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.201
<i>Meet you outside later.</i>

04:03.785 --> 04:05.161
<i>Outside the office isn't safe.</i>

04:07.497 --> 04:09.958
<i>-Then middle?</i>
<i>-Middle where?</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:11.000
<i>Streets?</i>

04:11.084 --> 04:13.920
<i>Or we can meet up there?</i>

04:14.003 --> 04:15.588
<i>I think it's a better idea.</i>

04:16.798 --> 04:18.382
<i>Are you shooting a spy movie?</i>

04:20.176 --> 04:21.719
Who are you messaging with?

04:22.220 --> 04:23.388
Uh?

04:24.389 --> 04:26.307
-Mom.
-Your mom?

04:26.557 --> 04:30.645
-Something happened?
-Something with my family.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.399
-All have their own family things.
-True.

05:13.563 --> 05:14.981
<i>Hello?</i>

05:15.857 --> 05:17.317
I'm Woo-young.

05:26.534 --> 05:29.454
-Oh, please sit. You don't have to.
-Okay.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.043
-What do you want to have?
-Oh, I will order.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.378
It's fine, it's on me. I'm your senior.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.673
-Then I'll have an iced cafe mocha.
-With cream?

05:41.257 --> 05:43.134
-A little.
-A little?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.929
Iced cafe mocha with a little cream in it.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.607
Thank you.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.619
-Why did you come to school?
-Summer session.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.412
Right, you told me that.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.210
What did you want to tell me about?

06:17.418 --> 06:18.836
Uh? Ah...

06:20.463 --> 06:22.131
Well, you know...

06:23.132 --> 06:25.676
-You gave me the...
-The letter I gave you?

06:27.303 --> 06:28.304
Yes.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.934
I've been thinking after reading it.

06:33.017 --> 06:36.020
It's okay, please be honest with me.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.482
Okay, honest...

06:41.067 --> 06:42.527
Honestly,

06:43.528 --> 06:45.446
I think you're awesome.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.659
But you're trying to say
I'm not your type?

06:49.742 --> 06:50.827
Uh?

06:54.497 --> 06:56.290
-Yes.
-I see.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.000
Nothing we can do.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.172
-I'll finish this before I go.
-Take your time.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.770
I've been turned down several times.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.356
Time will help you.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.735
Depends. It takes longer for some people.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.988
Right, some people do.

07:32.243 --> 07:34.871
-Do you like the summer session?
-No, I don't.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.331
No, you don't like it...

07:42.086 --> 07:47.008
I don't want you to get drunk too much
because you feel low, just saying.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.802
I will try not to.

07:51.554 --> 07:52.930
You can do it.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.982
-I'm leaving.
-Uh, oh.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.905
-Bye.
-See you.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.288
You really don't like Sua?

08:17.371 --> 08:21.000
Am I nuts? She told me
that she likes Kyung-seok.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.295
See you!

08:29.675 --> 08:32.595
-Uh, see you.
-Bye!

08:35.681 --> 08:38.392
I think he got upset.
You told him you like Kyung-seok.

08:40.019 --> 08:44.232
-Would you stop talking about him?
-Ah, sorry.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.529
-Let's have lunch, shall we?
-Sure!

08:49.862 --> 08:51.239
What do you like to have?

09:07.672 --> 09:08.965
Anything particular in mind?

09:10.299 --> 09:13.427
-Men's cologne.
-A new cologne came, a few days ago.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.305
It's gender neutral.
Do you want to try this?

09:31.779 --> 09:34.365
-I like it.
-All set?

09:34.490 --> 09:37.201
-Yes.
-Is it for your boyfriend?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.831
Yes, it's for my boyfriend.

09:41.914 --> 09:47.169
-If you want to engrave letters, tell me.
-Really?

09:49.213 --> 09:53.175
Then, I'll go with D, K, S, and...

09:56.220 --> 09:59.140
-A heart mark.
-I will.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.355
Good evening.

10:08.816 --> 10:12.486
Did you enjoy? It's 187,000 won.

10:13.195 --> 10:14.196
Thank you.

10:15.865 --> 10:16.907
Please sign here.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.457
Thanks.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.702
-I don't want to bump into college people.
-You know what?

11:04.163 --> 11:05.289
You stick out.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.250
-What?
-It's like shooting a spy film.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.757
-Was it?
-We used to go out for movies

11:15.091 --> 11:17.176
and have dinner and drink.

11:17.843 --> 11:22.014
We had an excuse back then.
We had assignments for pop culture class.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.308
That was your excuse, too?

11:24.892 --> 11:26.602
-What?
-For me, it was an excuse.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.396
To go watch a movie with you.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.906
-Let's order first.
-Alright.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.289
-Aglio e olio for me.
-I think you like that a lot.

11:47.873 --> 11:51.836
-You ordered it last time too.
-I used to order cheap meals.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.548
<i>Ah, I'm too embarrassed.</i>

11:57.007 --> 11:58.509
Actually I was worried.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.346
-I didn't have enough money.
-Did you?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.599
I could've paid too.
Why didn't you ask me to?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.518
I asked you out.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.733
-Are you ready to order?
-Two aglio e olios, and...

12:14.275 --> 12:17.778
-I'll have Coke, you?
-Same as you.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.865
-The same, please.
-Okay, right away.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.088
Let me go to the restroom first.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.850
Okay, let's have a good dinner
and get over it.

12:48.476 --> 12:52.021
-Good food can't actually cheer me up.
-It can!

12:53.439 --> 12:54.774
-Huh?
-Kyung-seok?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.529
-Hi.
-What are you doing here alone?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.990
-Or are you with someone?
-No.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.284
Alone, I came alone.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.870
-Alone?
-For dinner.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.125
-Okay, enjoy.
-See you.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.453
Feels like I drank alcohol.
I feel hot.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.167
Whether I date him or not,
my heart goes crazy.

13:56.126 --> 13:58.254
It drives me nuts.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.891
I decided. I'll have this one.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.774
Then I'll go for this one.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.448
What should I do?

14:26.740 --> 14:29.285
What should I do now?
What should I do? Ah...

14:36.208 --> 14:38.127
You care about what he said?

14:38.711 --> 14:42.965
You're not going to drink
because he doesn't want you to?

14:43.048 --> 14:47.052
You're right. I think I should.
He cares about me so much.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.805
Hmm, he's a good man.

15:01.275 --> 15:02.568
Excuse me?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.573
Could you take this
to the women's restroom?

15:08.115 --> 15:08.949
Sorry?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.911
Please, quickly.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.287
Ah, okay.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.487
What should I do?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.867
Excuse me?

15:55.037 --> 15:57.581
Uh, my bag.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.625
Your friend asked me to bring this to you.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.711
Ah, thank you.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.672
Thank you so much.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.802
Ah, damn it.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.024
Hello?

16:24.108 --> 16:26.402
-Tae-hee is on her way.
-What?

16:38.330 --> 16:42.292
Don't answer, just listen.
I'll hold their attention.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.627
You leave then, okay?

16:57.474 --> 16:59.184
Now it's really a spy movie.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.146
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow.

17:11.070 --> 17:12.321
We're dating.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.117
Whatever.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.579
KOO TAE-YOUNG

17:26.878 --> 17:28.130
Hello?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.512
-Right now?
<i>-I need to ask something.</i>

17:36.847 --> 17:39.641
-About what?
<i>-Let's talk in person.</i>

17:40.517 --> 17:42.227
<i>It won't take long.</i>

17:53.405 --> 17:54.907
He is having two dishes.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.410
You can do that, too.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.705
But I don't eat two dishes by myself.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.499
Rather, I order three for two.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.422
Mind if I sit?

18:10.881 --> 18:12.925
No, have a seat.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.554
What did you order?

18:19.014 --> 18:20.974
-We?
-Yes.

18:21.058 --> 18:24.561
-Uh, I'm having rose pasta.
-I ordered aglio e olio.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.687
I ordered it too.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.734
-Two of them?
-Yes.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.487
Wow, you eat more than I thought.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.116
-I sometimes eat too much.
-How much is too much?

18:40.285 --> 18:43.789
But honestly, one serving
at BBQ restaurants isn't for one person.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.374
What?

18:46.917 --> 18:47.751
Enjoy.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.048
That's it? To ask what we ordered?

18:53.674 --> 18:57.052
-Uh, he's weird.
-He was living in his own small world.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.930
And now finally he may want
to communicate with people.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.268
-Do you think so?
-Yes.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.065
Kyung-seok!

19:15.404 --> 19:18.574
-Are you alright?
-I'm so sorry. You must be hungry.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.703
-You couldn't eat, either.
-I don't feel hungry at all.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.624
-Can we go now?
-Where else can we go?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.465
Are you a meerkat?

19:36.091 --> 19:38.427
Sorry for distracting you.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.770
-Let's get home now.
-Hmm?

19:48.854 --> 19:51.106
I don't want you to be nervous like that.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.153
-I'm sorry.
-We have plenty of time ahead.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.411
What did you say to them?
Did you say you came alone?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.288
Yes.

20:07.497 --> 20:11.043
-So I made you lie.
-It wasn't a bad lie.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.087
They might have thought you are weird.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.173
Saying you go to dinner alone.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.634
I'm okay, never mind.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.054
You know, I don't want to bother about...

20:23.805 --> 20:25.974
how people think of me.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.439
I'm fine with that.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.361
I got used to the unwanted attention
from others.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.908
It used to be that way for my whole life.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.413
-Shall we?
-Alright.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.140
-Hello!
-Thanks for welcoming me.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.148
-You are awesome.
-Ah, thanks.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.945
-Please work hard to prop up the economy.
-Okay, I will.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.698
I will, you know my motto is...

21:30.038 --> 21:31.206
What is it?

21:36.336 --> 21:38.255
Ah, I'm screwed.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.966
I'll do my best. Thanks for your support.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.760
-Yes!
-Thanks.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.101
Mr. Mayor, please take a look.

21:53.770 --> 21:58.066
-What is this?
-Kyung-hee seems to run an online channel.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.944
Under the nickname of Dovely,
she talks about

22:01.028 --> 22:03.572
what her rich life is like
and praises extravagance.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.262
-So what did you want to ask?
-First of all...

22:28.430 --> 22:30.474
I wanted to say thank you.

22:33.310 --> 22:37.189
You know I'm kind of indecisive.

22:38.065 --> 22:40.108
But after you talked to me that night,

22:40.776 --> 22:42.527
I've become a bit more confident.

22:44.946 --> 22:45.947
Thanks.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.950
-About what?
-You told me...

22:50.035 --> 22:51.286
to follow my heart.

22:53.163 --> 22:53.997
So...

23:00.379 --> 23:05.550
Here. I bought it for you.
It's a necklace.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.137
Tae-young.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.641
-Yes.
-Why did you ever think of me,

23:12.724 --> 23:14.559
and why are you giving me this?

23:14.643 --> 23:15.811
Uh?

23:16.645 --> 23:20.107
I feel it's a bit too much.
Why are you doing this to me?

23:21.066 --> 23:23.068
Ah, back then...

23:23.819 --> 23:25.987
I think we felt some chemistry...

23:27.572 --> 23:28.615
between us.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.120
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I mean...

23:33.745 --> 23:40.210
You asked me what I'd do
if I found out someone likes me.

23:41.044 --> 23:44.548
Did you ever think that I like you?

23:47.926 --> 23:51.263
What I meant was if you have
a second thought about it,

23:51.388 --> 23:56.143
it shows you don't have
much affection for your girlfriend.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.938
And I wished for the best
for both of you.

24:09.364 --> 24:10.407
Why?

24:11.199 --> 24:13.034
I have to go now.

24:33.054 --> 24:36.641
What's going on?
What the heck is going on between them?

24:52.949 --> 24:56.828
The other day, you told me you can
be my company if I feel low.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.955
Of course I meant it.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.916
I'm a huge fan of yours.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.628
I see.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.090
Uh, well, to be honest,

25:10.091 --> 25:12.552
I have not had much dating experience.

25:13.470 --> 25:17.641
-I had a lot on my mind while dating her.
-Tell me about it.

25:18.517 --> 25:22.646
I don't know, maybe I started dating her
without thinking deeply about my feelings.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.691
-Ah...
-Of course, she is gorgeous.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.779
And she's cute.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.950
I have feelings for her.

25:35.325 --> 25:36.284
But...

25:38.703 --> 25:41.498
-I don't know.
-Hmm...

25:42.832 --> 25:44.751
-What if...
-Yes?

25:45.877 --> 25:49.381
...you found out someone likes you,

25:50.006 --> 25:51.466
how would you feel?

25:54.761 --> 25:56.304
Hah, what?

25:57.722 --> 25:59.391
Will you have second thoughts?

26:01.309 --> 26:02.727
Well, no...

26:04.729 --> 26:06.189
I'm not sure.

26:07.607 --> 26:14.072
I don't know that much, but I think
you should follow your heart.

26:20.036 --> 26:21.538
Did I get it wrong?

26:23.873 --> 26:24.916
Did I?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.723
Oh, my gosh.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.601
What's so "oh, my gosh"?

26:42.684 --> 26:47.522
You and Kyung-seok will be, like,
holding hands together, and...

26:47.856 --> 26:51.318
What are you guys going to do next?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.319
Stop it.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.447
-I'm not ready to accept this.
-What are you talking about?

26:55.572 --> 26:58.533
-I won't be able to see you two.
-Screw you.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.412
You seem more confident than ever.
You told me you can't date him.

27:02.495 --> 27:05.957
It's not about confidence. We'll still
keep it a secret from college people.

27:06.291 --> 27:07.917
College? Secret?

27:08.001 --> 27:10.128
Of course, it should be that way.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.590
He already gets too much attention.
Now it will get worse.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.176
They want to know who he's dating
after ditching Sua.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.969
If they find out it was me...

27:19.929 --> 27:20.764
Ugh...

27:20.930 --> 27:23.516
What if they find out?
What are you going to do?

27:25.935 --> 27:29.481
I wasn't that careful
before I started all this.

27:29.564 --> 27:32.776
Okay, you just focus on you two

27:32.859 --> 27:38.531
and what you want to do with him,
like cuddling, cuddling, and cuddling.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.950
Stop talking about cuddling.

27:41.242 --> 27:45.372
-Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle!
-I said stop!

27:45.580 --> 27:48.333
-Wait, wait.
-What?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.002
Woo-young knows this?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.169
Seem like you're tied up.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.256
I'm reading some papers.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.722
-You want to talk?
-Well, no.

28:47.142 --> 28:48.101
I mean yes.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.938
-What is it?
-We can talk later if you're busy.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.983
I am, but go on.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.987
About Mi-rae.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.906
Not going well with her?

29:03.783 --> 29:06.161
Well, actually it turned out well.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.665
Turned out well.

29:13.084 --> 29:15.587
Hah, I was expecting something else.

29:18.131 --> 29:21.676
-Do you feel sorry for me?
-Not like that.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.055
-I don't need to.
-Then why are you acting awkwardly?

29:27.640 --> 29:28.767
Congrats.

29:32.061 --> 29:33.980
But could you keep it secret
at school?

29:34.439 --> 29:36.900
-Why?
-I'm just asking.

29:37.901 --> 29:40.612
-I'll go to sleep.
-Okay.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.155
Have a dream about Mi-rae.

30:17.941 --> 30:22.278
Wait, did you drink all of it?

30:22.445 --> 30:25.365
-We had 10 bottles.
-Yes.

30:26.074 --> 30:29.077
I want to keep in shape, too.

30:29.994 --> 30:35.124
I gained only a few pounds,
but my waist got this much bigger.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.046
Don't be so selfish.
Help me get in shape, okay?

30:41.130 --> 30:42.632
I'll get more for you.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.718
Will you go into the office
with Kyung-seok?

30:47.178 --> 30:51.558
Of course you will.
Like cuddly-cuddly.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.893
Cuddly-cuddly.

30:53.977 --> 30:56.354
-Not funny at all.
-For me it is!

30:56.437 --> 30:58.690
-Not funny.
-So what?

31:06.364 --> 31:09.242
<i>So he won't come here today?</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:20.420
How long have you been here?

31:21.087 --> 31:23.172
-For 10 minutes?
-You could've called me.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.716
Anyway, you came out.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.303
Before we go, let's stop by somewhere.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.597
-Where?
-Just follow me.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.818
You want to buy masks?
Did you catch a cold?

31:44.444 --> 31:46.070
No, to cover my face.

31:46.571 --> 31:49.532
-Why?
-Because I don't want you to be a meerkat.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.409
I'm going to wear it.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.661
But the weather is too hot.

31:56.247 --> 31:58.458
Then, I'm wearing it.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.668
No, I'll do it.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.962
You're doing it for me, so I should.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.966
Then let's wear it together.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.061
-Feeling okay?
-Yes.

32:18.436 --> 32:22.231
I feel like we're drawing
even more attention.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.026
I said I would wear it alone.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.195
-You can take it off.
-No, it's okay.

32:27.278 --> 32:29.030
-You take it off.
-No, you take it off.

32:30.156 --> 32:32.992
It feels so weird to keep saying
"take it off."

32:35.078 --> 32:37.830
Okay, we both take them off.
Your chin must be itchy.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.584
We can tell people we're living
in the same neighborhood.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.546
Just let go of my hands.

33:03.898 --> 33:05.692
Where do you want to go?

33:06.901 --> 33:10.321
-Somewhere distant?
-Like where?

33:11.322 --> 33:12.615
I'll think about it.

33:19.747 --> 33:23.418
-Hi.
-There must be something with Sua.

33:26.337 --> 33:28.881
It seemed like he was trying to confess.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.467
Sua had a gift in front of her.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.845
And something serious
was going on between them.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.306
But then she dumped him.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.850
Hah.

33:39.267 --> 33:44.147
He'd never been alone with a girl.
He was always around people.

33:45.106 --> 33:48.109
Okay, if, just if...

33:48.192 --> 33:50.445
Let's say he likes Sua at the moment.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.449
But he just broke up with you.
How can this happen so suddenly?

33:54.532 --> 33:57.869
I think there must have been something
while he was dating you.

33:59.495 --> 34:04.625
Now I see. He didn't seem to listen
to me, looked distant around me.

34:05.209 --> 34:08.004
He used to text to someone
even when I was around.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.338
I knew it!

34:10.757 --> 34:13.926
There's always a reason
for such a sudden breakup.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.286
You came early.

34:51.047 --> 34:52.172
Sua.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.719
How about lunch after this?

34:56.886 --> 34:59.222
-On me.
-Why?

35:00.431 --> 35:03.434
I thought you might feel awkward
around Kyung-seok.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.398
Thanks.
I'm lucky to have you.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.660
Come in.

35:25.915 --> 35:27.125
Hi.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.043
Hi, Hyun-jung.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.880
-Not a good time?
-It's okay, almost done.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.217
-Why did you come to school?
-To return some books.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.260
Hmm.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.264
-How about taking a coffee break?
-Sure.

35:41.514 --> 35:42.807
Wait a second.

35:46.769 --> 35:49.647
What did you say to the girl
you told me about?

35:49.730 --> 35:51.440
She seems perfectly okay.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.694
But I have no idea
how she's been since then.

35:55.194 --> 35:57.405
How do you feel now?

35:57.947 --> 35:59.740
Well, I am...

36:00.116 --> 36:02.577
worried about her.
I hope she's going to be fine.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.914
Not her.
I'm asking about you.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.000
Me?

36:10.084 --> 36:12.336
You used to like Mi-rae.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.963
How did you...

36:15.173 --> 36:18.843
-Did you know that I liked her?
-Of course, I major in psychology.

36:20.052 --> 36:20.887
Hah.

36:21.304 --> 36:24.056
I didn't even tell you,
and you never saw what happened.

36:28.895 --> 36:29.854
Then you must...

36:31.105 --> 36:34.400
know I was turned down
after telling her I like her.

36:37.028 --> 36:37.862
Ah.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.741
That I didn't know.

36:47.830 --> 36:50.499
I didn't know there's something
best friends don't share.

36:52.793 --> 36:54.503
Oh, you told her.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.174
Of course I did.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.386
Wishing for even a 1% chance
it would work...

37:02.470 --> 37:05.890
If I didn't, I would have regretted it.
Don't you think?

37:07.767 --> 37:10.019
Maybe guys and girls
think differently about this.

37:10.102 --> 37:13.856
I won't do that
unless there's a 99% chance.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.317
Why would I, if he might reject me?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.995
I think I have lots to learn from you.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.921
I'm actually an N.B.S.B.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.970
Sorry.

37:48.140 --> 37:49.976
I think they're all out for lunch.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.936
Only Dong-hoon is here.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.983
Won-ho went out with Sung-woon.
He seems disappointed with Sua.

37:57.066 --> 38:00.152
Tae-hee and Yoon-a seem to have
some secrets to talk about.

38:01.070 --> 38:03.364
Sua suddenly went out with Eun.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.120
I thought he wanted to be in our group.
But he is eating alone now.

38:18.879 --> 38:20.548
What? Sit.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.232
Why are you sitting next to me
and not Mi-rae?

38:42.820 --> 38:45.573
He doesn't sit next to me all the time.

38:46.407 --> 38:50.786
You know he's far from a sociable person.
He only gets along with his old friend.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.206
Am I not sociable?

38:54.749 --> 38:56.625
Yes, you didn't know?

38:57.626 --> 39:00.796
Wow, you are indeed not sociable.

39:03.007 --> 39:07.136
He has a sense of humor
and like to talk with people.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.849
Do you know who he likes?

39:14.935 --> 39:16.520
Well, I don't know.

39:17.396 --> 39:19.023
Are you in a relationship with her?

39:22.443 --> 39:24.987
-Yes.
-Wow.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.823
-Who?
-You don't need to know.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.451
Why do you keep it secret?

39:32.912 --> 39:34.163
Oh, wait.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.087
-A celebrity?
-No.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.632
Hey, I just saw your nervous face.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.133
Am I right?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.219
No?

39:49.136 --> 39:51.639
Ah, then who?

39:51.889 --> 39:53.391
I'm dying to know who.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.519
Why do you want to know
who I'm seeing?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.687
Of course I'd like to know.

39:59.355 --> 40:02.233
I want to know the girl who beat Sua.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.905
Do you have any idea who?

40:08.656 --> 40:10.574
Uh? No.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.249
Should I move to another college?

40:20.418 --> 40:23.879
You are hilarious, indeed.
You want to move to another college?

40:39.437 --> 40:41.689
Sua shouldn't have talked to you
in person.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.693
I was dumb.

40:45.776 --> 40:48.487
I should've just ignored her and left.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.909
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.036
That's what she wants.

41:07.256 --> 41:08.757
I didn't get mad about you.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.302
Kyung-seok?

41:14.305 --> 41:16.056
What are you guys doing here?

41:23.606 --> 41:24.690
You two...

41:25.608 --> 41:27.276
were dating?

41:35.451 --> 41:37.244
You two!

41:37.328 --> 41:40.456
You're dating?
Isn't it so lovely?

41:43.083 --> 41:46.504
Why don't you say something?
Did I surprise you?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.464
What's wrong with me finding out?

41:49.965 --> 41:52.635
-Didn't we surprise you?
-Of course you did.

41:53.052 --> 41:55.846
See how much I'm surprised.
It's so surprising!

41:56.931 --> 42:01.268
I've always wanted for you to date
a person like Mi-rae.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.897
So it's a good surprise for me.
My wish has been realized.

42:06.690 --> 42:11.320
I wanted to have a break here,
but I don't think it's a good idea now.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.657
I'll leave you guys alone.
Enjoy your time together.

42:17.826 --> 42:19.245
See you.

42:21.956 --> 42:24.124
-She is so cool.
-She really is.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.294
Is it because she lived overseas for long?

42:31.507 --> 42:34.260
-Are you alright?
-Uh? Why?

42:34.343 --> 42:35.803
Getting busted.

42:37.763 --> 42:38.639
Uh...

42:41.141 --> 42:43.310
I think I'm fine.

43:05.624 --> 43:08.127
Do you want to talk about something?

43:11.046 --> 43:12.256
Finished?

43:13.257 --> 43:14.300
Yes.

43:19.638 --> 43:20.556
Tell me.

43:22.057 --> 43:23.142
Actually...

43:23.225 --> 43:25.477
I saw you the other night.

43:27.813 --> 43:30.274
Back when Tae-young was walking you home.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.319
Ah. You saw us?

43:34.612 --> 43:36.447
We bumped into each other.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.741
He walked me home, since it was late.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.201
I said I was okay, but...

43:43.203 --> 43:45.456
Is there something wrong with it?

43:47.374 --> 43:51.503
Yena saw you were with him last night.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.592
She thinks you broke up
their relationship.

43:56.675 --> 43:57.551
Well...

43:58.761 --> 44:04.058
I saw him last night,
but I asked him to get back together...

44:05.476 --> 44:07.770
with Tae-hee.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.314
That's all I said to him.

44:12.733 --> 44:16.445
If you want to talk about something,
I'm all ears.

44:23.952 --> 44:26.121
Actually, I think...

44:27.039 --> 44:29.833
I'm often misunderstood like this.

44:33.379 --> 44:37.257
I might not be able to blend in
with girl friends.

44:44.431 --> 44:46.767
It seems like it's my college.

44:47.393 --> 44:48.477
Could it be...?

44:59.113 --> 45:00.864
Why are you surprised to see me?

45:01.782 --> 45:02.783
Nothing.

45:03.659 --> 45:04.785
You bastard.

45:06.036 --> 45:08.122
Show me.

45:08.789 --> 45:11.333
-Hey, give it back to me.
-Hold on.

45:12.167 --> 45:13.001
Hmm?

45:17.506 --> 45:19.717
-Hey, give it to me.
-Wait.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.227
<i>-Ah, I don't like it.</i>
<i>-Thanks for good photos.</i>

45:30.352 --> 45:31.854
<i>She's too petite.</i>

45:31.937 --> 45:35.482
-Hey, don't you think it's Sua?
-Just give me that.

45:38.068 --> 45:39.278
Well.

45:40.946 --> 45:43.115
I think she's going crazy.

45:43.699 --> 45:45.159
I heard Kyung-seok rejected her.

45:45.743 --> 45:49.455
-What?
-She told she likes him, in public.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.331
-For real?
-Hah.

45:51.415 --> 45:56.420
I think we misunderstood her
by the way she looks.

45:56.503 --> 45:57.337
Hah.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.426
Should I call her up to cheer her up?

46:04.344 --> 46:07.598
Hey, call her and don't say I'm here.

46:07.931 --> 46:11.769
I used to have some chemistry
with her, so...

46:11.977 --> 46:14.313
Okay, I should go now.

46:15.272 --> 46:20.277
Hey. We've got nothing to lose.
Make a call to her, huh?

46:25.657 --> 46:27.576
-Bye.
-See you around.

46:33.874 --> 46:34.875
Kyung-hee.

46:38.587 --> 46:41.340
-Hi.
-Your dad needs to talk to you.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.304
You want to talk? Go ahead.

46:50.432 --> 46:52.810
The videos you uploaded...

46:52.893 --> 46:53.977
Delete them all.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.897
The Dovely mukbang thing.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.484
It's already viral.

47:01.443 --> 47:04.988
-You can't delete them?
-I can't, they're already shared.

47:06.323 --> 47:07.199
You...

47:09.284 --> 47:12.538
You know my slogan is
to make better lives for ordinary people.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.456
Why'd you show off your expensive bags?

47:15.541 --> 47:17.209
Did I ever ask for those?

47:17.334 --> 47:20.254
I never asked. Is it my fault
for letting people know about it?

47:24.550 --> 47:25.634
Okay.

47:27.511 --> 47:29.763
-Any other way to solve this?
-No.

47:30.305 --> 47:31.139
Bye.

47:44.736 --> 47:47.281
This hand is only for bus rides.

47:50.117 --> 47:52.035
By the way, where are we headed?

47:53.829 --> 47:57.124
Let's go somewhere far.
I don't want you to get nervous.

48:05.215 --> 48:07.759
-Hey...
-You can't pick it up with one hand?

48:17.019 --> 48:17.978
Hello.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.773
Yes, I'm on my way back.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.236
Is it? Okay, see you later.

48:29.448 --> 48:30.866
-Hyun-jung?
-Yes.

48:31.825 --> 48:33.744
She's going to see her parents.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.789
-When is she coming back?
-Tomorrow, she said.

48:53.805 --> 48:54.848
Only if...

48:55.515 --> 48:57.601
you feel pressured outside.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.939
You keep acting like a meerkat.

49:11.323 --> 49:14.660
Do you want to come over?

49:16.995 --> 49:19.998
Well, not a bad idea.

49:21.875 --> 49:25.045
Okay, let's go then.

49:38.100 --> 49:42.312
<i>If you want to talk about something,</i>
<i>I'm all ears.</i>

49:51.029 --> 49:51.863
Hello?

49:55.033 --> 49:57.577
Ah, is it you? Hi.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.123
You must have been surprised
by my call.

50:03.792 --> 50:09.089
I know it's quite out of the blue.
But I need to tell you something I saw.

50:09.464 --> 50:11.550
I think you should know this.

50:13.635 --> 50:14.511
What is it?

50:14.594 --> 50:17.097
Do you have time now?

50:17.639 --> 50:18.473
Now?

50:18.890 --> 50:21.018
<i>If you're up to something, it's fine.</i>

50:21.560 --> 50:23.645
<i>But I want you to know this soon.</i>

50:34.823 --> 50:37.701
Wait.<i> </i>I will be back soon.

50:38.285 --> 50:40.370
-Where are you going?
-Wait inside.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.123
-Alright.
-I'll be back soon.

50:43.206 --> 50:44.041
Yes.

50:51.048 --> 50:52.466
-Hi.
-What the...

50:53.175 --> 50:55.427
-Why are you so surprised?
-No...

50:56.678 --> 51:00.640
-Why did you suddenly come here?
-Your mom wanted to see you.

51:00.724 --> 51:03.685
No, you said you missed her.

51:10.108 --> 51:12.986
Are you... okay?

51:14.613 --> 51:17.741
-Of course, I am.
-I mean, friends...

51:17.991 --> 51:21.328
-Do you get along with them?
-What are you talking about?

51:21.411 --> 51:25.874
I wonder if you're doing well
with friends.

51:25.999 --> 51:28.376
If you have a boyfriend
you can tell me about it.

51:34.466 --> 51:36.176
How many candles do you need?

51:37.260 --> 51:38.428
One large candle, please.

51:52.984 --> 51:55.612
-Is this non-alcohol?
-Yes.

52:02.369 --> 52:06.123
-Do you sell these too?
-No, they are for decor.

52:06.706 --> 52:07.958
Can't you sell these to me?

52:10.460 --> 52:14.881
-I don't think there will be glasses.
-You're going to your girlfriend's house.

52:16.049 --> 52:16.883
Yes.

52:17.676 --> 52:20.971
Then I will sell them to you.
I'll charge the original price only.

52:21.596 --> 52:22.848
Thank you.

52:36.695 --> 52:40.157
<i>Mom and Dad are here.</i>
<i>I'll text you later. Sorry.</i>

52:48.373 --> 52:50.667
Why didn't you come with Hyun-jung?

52:51.084 --> 52:53.587
You don't have to stay alone.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.255
I have lots to do...

52:55.755 --> 52:57.716
What? During summer break?

52:57.799 --> 53:00.260
Well, some stuff.

53:00.844 --> 53:04.681
The research center
gives me a lot of work.

53:05.140 --> 53:07.434
-Do they give you assignments?
-Yes.

53:07.934 --> 53:10.645
So you can leave now.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.607
You said you didn't have dinner yet.

53:15.984 --> 53:19.362
I forgot. I already ate with my friends.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.740
Now I know why I was full.

53:21.823 --> 53:25.619
-Which friends of yours?
-You know, friends doing my major.

53:25.702 --> 53:28.580
Specifically who?
Tell me about your close friends.

53:28.663 --> 53:30.957
How would you know
who they are?

53:32.042 --> 53:35.545
Of course I don't know them.
I know Kyung-seok only.

53:37.505 --> 53:39.507
I'm just curious.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.509
I just want to know
who's on your side.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.805
-Side?
-Enough, get to the point.

53:46.556 --> 53:50.227
-When are you coming home?
-Uh, I will soon.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.437
After the center job is done.

53:54.105 --> 53:57.275
So please just go now.

53:57.359 --> 53:59.319
Why are you kicking us out?

53:59.611 --> 54:01.488
I came here to see you.

54:01.571 --> 54:04.658
When did I try to kick you out?

54:05.242 --> 54:08.578
I was just worried.
Driving at night is hard.

54:08.662 --> 54:11.164
What is hard?
I can even drive with my eyes closed.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.833
You can't! What nonsense.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.087
I'm just saying.

54:17.170 --> 54:20.090
Who can drive with eyes shut?

54:20.173 --> 54:22.175
I'm just scared.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.595
You drive every day,
but you always have to be careful.

54:25.971 --> 54:28.723
I know, you don't have to worry about it.

54:29.683 --> 54:31.101
Okay, it's done.

54:32.143 --> 54:34.771
-Anything I can fix for you?
-No, thanks.

54:42.696 --> 54:44.239
-Hi.
-Oh.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.533
Hi, have a seat.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.831
You want to have a beer?

54:55.041 --> 54:56.084
Okay.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.461
Two 500cc glasses, please.

55:00.046 --> 55:02.424
Why did you want to see me?

55:03.008 --> 55:03.925
Well.

55:04.301 --> 55:08.221
I may be overreacting, but...

55:09.848 --> 55:12.600
-Well, as a matter of fact...
-Jung-yeob.

55:17.147 --> 55:20.108
Hi, Sua. Wow.

55:21.067 --> 55:22.444
Hah, what a...

55:23.236 --> 55:25.905
Hey, I need to talk with Sua.

55:26.614 --> 55:27.449
Excuse me?

55:28.241 --> 55:29.075
500cc, please.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.660
-Alright.
-Chan-woo.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.455
You must feel low.

55:33.913 --> 55:35.290
As a man,

55:35.373 --> 55:39.002
I think Kyung-seok is just good-looking,
but kind of annoying.

55:39.669 --> 55:41.129
For me, you deserve better.

55:42.088 --> 55:43.590
Let's talk outside.

55:43.673 --> 55:46.259
-What are you doing?
-Come outside.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.012
What? Sua, wait.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.350
Knock it off.

55:53.433 --> 55:57.354
-Hands off of me.
-Let's talk.

55:57.437 --> 55:59.356
Go, now.

55:59.439 --> 56:01.733
-What?
-You didn't see her face?

56:01.816 --> 56:03.360
She feels uncomfortable with you.

56:03.443 --> 56:05.570
Hey, what?

56:06.237 --> 56:08.239
Do you think you can hit on her?

56:09.407 --> 56:11.201
I have more potential
than you do.

56:11.284 --> 56:15.622
Honestly, you hit on
every single girl at university.

56:15.705 --> 56:19.626
-What did you say?
-Don't mess with me, leave!

56:19.709 --> 56:22.003
Ah, what the heck. Hey!

57:11.886 --> 57:16.683
Sua, sorry. You must have been
uncomfortable. I should've let him go.

57:17.684 --> 57:18.935
What's this?

57:21.646 --> 57:22.856
Uh...

57:24.941 --> 57:28.778
In fact, that was
what I wanted to talk about.

57:29.654 --> 57:31.739
I happened to find it online.

57:33.366 --> 57:34.200
Is it...

57:35.785 --> 57:37.120
Is it you?

57:39.956 --> 57:42.584
-No.
-No?

57:42.667 --> 57:43.710
It's not me.

57:44.169 --> 57:47.297
It's not hard to take photos like these
with similar outfits.

57:48.047 --> 57:49.716
Well, you're right.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.553
But, I just care about you.

57:55.221 --> 57:57.807
-Hey, come outside.
-Wait.

57:57.891 --> 58:01.269
-Knock it off.
-I can't stand the way you talk to me.

58:01.352 --> 58:03.980
I can't just go.

58:04.063 --> 58:05.773
Why are you doing this to me?

58:05.857 --> 58:07.734
Sua, wait, Sua.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.445
She's leaving because of you!

58:10.528 --> 58:13.281
Don't ever think about seeing him.

58:13.364 --> 58:15.867
-What did you just say?
-Stop.

58:15.950 --> 58:18.661
Hey, stop, stop.

58:19.329 --> 58:23.333
-Argh!
-Hands off of me first.

58:28.129 --> 58:30.131
<i>Who was it? Who took the photos?</i>

58:30.882 --> 58:32.133
<i>Why try to mess with me?</i>

58:32.800 --> 58:34.427
<i>I need to find out.</i>

58:54.906 --> 58:57.075
<i>They left. Sorry.</i>

59:19.681 --> 59:20.807
I'm coming.

59:41.077 --> 59:42.078
I'm so sorry.

59:45.290 --> 59:46.749
What is this?

59:47.750 --> 59:49.043
I bought this for you.

59:56.050 --> 59:57.844
It's good that we don't have a TV.

1:00:02.890 --> 1:00:04.559
This is how I live.

1:00:05.435 --> 1:00:06.519
I know.

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:08.605
I came here before.

1:00:12.108 --> 1:00:13.526
I laid you down there.

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:22.577
Have a seat.

1:00:26.664 --> 1:00:29.500
Not there.

1:00:29.584 --> 1:00:30.918
There.

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:48.061
-Did you make this?
-Yes.

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:50.480
-At home?
-Yes.

1:00:56.986 --> 1:00:58.154
Aren't you hungry?

1:00:58.237 --> 1:01:00.490
-A little.
-What about delivery?

1:01:00.573 --> 1:01:02.992
Chinese food will come quickly.

1:01:03.076 --> 1:01:05.912
-Anything will be good.
-Home food?

1:01:05.995 --> 1:01:09.123
-Or we can place an order.
-Well...

1:01:10.583 --> 1:01:13.044
My mom left some <i>banchan.</i>

1:01:15.630 --> 1:01:17.423
Well, my gut feeling is...

1:01:18.508 --> 1:01:20.718
I think she's hiding something.

1:01:20.802 --> 1:01:25.014
She used to do that.
She never told us what happened in shcool.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:27.558
Teachers let me know later.

1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:32.605
There must have been more
she was hiding.

1:01:32.689 --> 1:01:35.149
Don't see everything so negatively.

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:39.862
Kids were young then.
College kids won't bully her.

1:01:39.946 --> 1:01:42.240
She kept saying we should go.

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:46.577
I think she doesn't want to talk about
what she's going through.

1:01:47.161 --> 1:01:49.455
I shouldn't have left.

1:01:50.039 --> 1:01:53.042
-Or I should've taken her with us.
-Do you want to go back?

1:01:55.586 --> 1:01:59.340
It's okay. She might want to be alone.

1:02:00.758 --> 1:02:02.468
Let's just go.

1:02:06.305 --> 1:02:07.682
Is it good?

1:02:08.057 --> 1:02:08.975
Yes.

1:02:10.268 --> 1:02:12.145
Enjoy. There's more.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:17.150
I can't have it all.
She wanted you to eat this.

1:02:17.233 --> 1:02:19.736
I'm okay. You eat. All of it.

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:29.454
It is our first time
having dinner together.

1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:31.789
Right.

1:02:35.668 --> 1:02:38.671
-Sorry.
-Stop saying you're sorry.

1:02:44.302 --> 1:02:46.137
What do you want to do next?

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:48.806
A movie?

1:02:50.850 --> 1:02:53.811
Watching a movie takes too much time.

1:02:54.645 --> 1:02:57.523
Then, you choose.
I'm fine with anything.

1:02:58.107 --> 1:03:00.109
Well, not specifically...

1:03:02.570 --> 1:03:04.947
Do you want to make a candle?

1:03:05.031 --> 1:03:06.240
I'll teach you how.

1:03:07.575 --> 1:03:08.409
Okay.

1:03:19.587 --> 1:03:21.923
Keep stirring. I will mix this.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:23.633
Okay.

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.851
-Like this?
-Right.

1:03:43.319 --> 1:03:44.153
I have a question.

1:03:45.488 --> 1:03:47.156
When did you start liking me?

1:03:55.289 --> 1:04:00.503
When I first found out
that you didn't laugh at me.

1:04:04.340 --> 1:04:05.466
It's been a while, then.

1:04:10.555 --> 1:04:11.597
What about you?

1:04:13.724 --> 1:04:16.060
-Maybe at the OT.
-OT?

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:20.565
When I danced?

1:04:21.983 --> 1:04:22.817
No.

1:04:25.194 --> 1:04:27.321
When you did stupid things
because of Chan-woo,

1:04:28.531 --> 1:04:29.907
I was pissed off.

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:41.711
Keep stirring it.
Or it'll stick together.

1:04:44.255 --> 1:04:46.173
-Ah!
-Oh!

1:04:48.384 --> 1:04:51.846
-I'm okay.
-No, you're not.

1:04:52.179 --> 1:04:53.222
Come.

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:05.902
Stupid. You should've been more careful.

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:08.112
You can't touch the pot like that.

1:05:09.530 --> 1:05:13.200
-It wasn't that hot.
-You should run cold water over it.

1:05:14.076 --> 1:05:15.786
Burns really hurt.

1:05:24.003 --> 1:05:25.504
I should look for ice.

1:05:54.825 --> 1:05:56.077
You're wearing it.

1:06:00.456 --> 1:06:02.124
I used to hate it.

1:06:05.753 --> 1:06:07.380
But now it's growing on me.
