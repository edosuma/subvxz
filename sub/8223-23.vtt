00:02.774 --> 00:05.022
Narrator: On this episode of Mythbusters,

00:08.976 --> 00:12.727
Adam and Jamie make history
as they go back in time

00:12.728 --> 00:16.607
to recreate an attempt
to assassinate Hitler.

00:16.608 --> 00:17.899
I wouldn't want to be in that room.

00:19.191 --> 00:24.048
Narrator: Was a room change the reason
this bomb in a briefcase failed?

00:26.515 --> 00:27.123
Meantime,

00:28.261 --> 00:30.318
Kari, Tory and Grant

00:31.119 --> 00:33.204
take one for the team

00:35.137 --> 00:36.463
as they test out the myth

00:36.464 --> 00:40.037
that you really can slap
sense into someone.

00:41.144 --> 00:42.795
This myth sucks.

00:45.892 --> 00:47.899
Narrator: Who are the "Mythbusters"?

00:48.409 --> 00:49.213
Adam,

00:51.804 --> 00:53.665
Jamie,

00:54.941 --> 00:55.457
between them,

00:55.458 --> 00:59.241
more than 30 years of
special effects experience.

00:59.317 --> 01:00.444
Joining them,

01:00.446 --> 01:01.932
Tory,

01:03.821 --> 01:05.245
Grant

01:06.070 --> 01:07.047
and Kari.

01:07.048 --> 01:09.918
Science gets more fun
when I get a bigger gun.

01:10.064 --> 01:12.189
Narrator: They don't just tell the myths,

01:12.545 --> 01:15.037
they put them to the test.

01:25.743 --> 01:26.855
In 1944,

01:26.856 --> 01:30.438
a plot was hatched to kill Hitler and
the operation was successful enough

01:30.439 --> 01:33.698
to get a briefcase full of
explosives into the room

01:33.699 --> 01:36.624
with Hitler and detonate it.

01:37.390 --> 01:41.883
But the operation was a failure because
Hitler did not die in that blast.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.228
What went wrong?

01:44.576 --> 01:46.991
The meeting was supposed
to happen in a closed,

01:46.992 --> 01:48.059
underground bunker,

01:48.060 --> 01:49.178
but at the last minute,

01:49.179 --> 01:51.127
the meeting was switched
to an aboveground room.

01:52.276 --> 01:55.130
Conventional wisdom holds
that the same blast

01:55.131 --> 01:59.006
would have killed Hitler
if held under ground.

02:02.643 --> 02:05.795
Narrator: The venue was Hitler's
East Prussia headquarters.

02:05.796 --> 02:06.915
***

02:06.916 --> 02:10.428
***

02:10.429 --> 02:13.579
his weapon of choice was
a bomb and a briefcase.

02:13.580 --> 02:14.893
But late in the day,

02:14.894 --> 02:17.727
the meeting was moved
from a fortified bunker

02:17.728 --> 02:22.660
to a conference room aboveground
with conventional coors and windows.

02:22.661 --> 02:24.769
Four were killed in the blast,

02:24.770 --> 02:27.813
but Hitler survived with
just minor injuries.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.878
There are dozens of theories
about what went wrong,

02:30.879 --> 02:33.962
but the biggest is that it
was the change of venue.

02:33.963 --> 02:36.012
***

02:36.013 --> 02:37.313
***

02:37.314 --> 02:40.926
so this myth is a tale of two roofs.

02:41.011 --> 02:45.922
The question boils down whether or
not an explosion in a closed space

02:45.923 --> 02:49.387
is more deadly than one
in an open space, right?

02:49.388 --> 02:50.686
Exactly.

02:50.687 --> 02:52.112
Where do you think we should begin?

02:52.113 --> 02:53.396
Let's do some verge,

02:53.397 --> 02:55.309
start small and work our way up.

02:55.310 --> 02:56.745
Perfect.

02:58.043 --> 02:59.266
Narrator: History books are helpful,

02:59.267 --> 03:08.390
but Jamie's gone the extra mile and
sourced photos from the blast.

03:08.391 --> 03:13.755
What these photos tell me is
that the blast was quite severe.

03:13.812 --> 03:18.478
Given the fact that Hitler was standing
here when the bomb was right nearby

03:18.479 --> 03:21.575
and four people actually
did die from the blast,

03:21.926 --> 03:24.827
Hitler really narrowly escaped death.

03:24.828 --> 03:27.177
Narrator: While Jamie
pours over the details,

03:27.178 --> 03:30.090
Adam pours paint in a tubful of water.

03:30.091 --> 03:33.386
A simple experiment that
would show what happens

03:33.387 --> 03:36.751
when shock waves are
contained or released.

03:36.752 --> 03:40.020
All he needs now are to two model rooms.

03:40.021 --> 03:45.072
Why is the conventional wisdom,

03:45.073 --> 03:47.052
would have killed him in the bunker?

03:47.053 --> 03:51.020
I'm hoping to tease out the reasons
for that thinking with this.

03:51.021 --> 03:54.459
Before me, the four walls of the bunker.

03:54.460 --> 03:57.472
Item going to drop this little
weight into the center.

03:57.473 --> 03:58.807
Let's see what happens.

04:02.356 --> 04:03.727
Let's look at the high speed.

04:03.728 --> 04:07.342
Narrator: The idea is that the
ripples or waves of water behave

04:07.343 --> 04:09.679
much like a blast through air.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.575
Awesome.

04:11.576 --> 04:15.431
My visualization of waves in a closed
loop work room worked just like I hoped.

04:15.432 --> 04:20.514
You can see them hitting the
walls and then bouncing back.

04:20.515 --> 04:22.798
They've got nowhere to go.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.224
Narrator: Now, so see if
throwing open a few windows

04:25.225 --> 04:26.991
makes much of a difference.

04:26.992 --> 04:29.213
This is my situation room.

04:32.535 --> 04:34.397
Here is my bomb.

04:34.398 --> 04:35.883
Let's see what happens.

04:39.634 --> 04:40.589
Perfect.

04:41.358 --> 04:44.439
Narrator: The high speed confirm
what is Adam suspected.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.224
That's so cool.

04:45.225 --> 04:48.894
Narrator: Give a wave half a
chance to escape and it takes it.

04:49.938 --> 04:53.166
The waves are contained.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.784
They cannot escape.

04:54.785 --> 04:56.809
In the open room,

04:56.810 --> 04:58.649
the waves get out.

04:58.650 --> 05:02.070
Narrator: So, it looks like there's
some science to back up the myth.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.667
At headquarters,

05:03.668 --> 05:08.552
Jamie's now gotten his hands on the
official report of the bombing.

05:09.229 --> 05:12.220
Upper pressure would have destroyed
the situation room to a larger extent

05:12.221 --> 05:16.345
and exited through windows and doors
as well as through partition walls.

05:16.346 --> 05:19.232
Points of impact of metal
fragments not detectable,

05:19.233 --> 05:23.418
but spinters of wood and leather
fragments are embedded into the woods.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.461
In the immediate vicinity of
the center of the explosion.

05:29.462 --> 05:34.336
Narrator: So, the facts and photos are
dualy noted for future comparison.

05:34.337 --> 05:38.630
You have to agree that it's high
time they blew something up.

05:44.982 --> 05:47.791
This is going to hurt me
more than it hurts you.

05:48.001 --> 05:50.350
That did hurt.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.905
What was that for?

05:51.906 --> 05:53.222
I'm preparing you for the next myth,

05:53.223 --> 05:55.528
which is that you can
slap sense into someone.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.957
***

05:56.958 --> 05:58.227
***

05:58.228 --> 06:01.771
The idea if that is someone in
a state of confusion or shock,

06:01.772 --> 06:03.185
but slapping them,

06:03.186 --> 06:04.736
you can get them to focus,

06:04.737 --> 06:07.213
hone in their focus and perform better.

06:08.822 --> 06:11.818
Narrator: It's a familiar scene
from old school Hollywood.

06:11.819 --> 06:16.768
Someone flips out, good, sharp
slap brings them back around.

06:16.769 --> 06:20.479
It kind of makes sense what
with the shock and the sting,

06:20.480 --> 06:22.581
but does it work?

06:23.226 --> 06:24.472
When I think about this saying,

06:24.473 --> 06:26.259
I think about someone who's hysterical,

06:26.260 --> 06:28.104
on the edge of panic.

06:28.105 --> 06:30.119
How are we going to induce
panic in each other?

06:30.120 --> 06:31.159
I'm not sure we have to.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.906
I'd like to talk to a trauma expert.

06:32.907 --> 06:34.699
***

06:34.700 --> 06:36.474
***

06:36.475 --> 06:37.758
***

06:37.759 --> 06:39.518
as far as the testing goes,

06:39.519 --> 06:41.581
the preslap and slap test,

06:41.582 --> 06:43.586
they have to be a decision making test.

06:43.587 --> 06:45.447
We're not testing IQ here.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.993
We're testing how you make
decisions under pressure.

06:50.455 --> 06:51.089
Narrator: First up,

06:51.090 --> 06:56.065
Kari takes council to see how the
body responds to a slap in the chops.

06:56.066 --> 06:59.050
What do you think of the myth that
you can slap sense into someone?

06:59.051 --> 07:03.740
A lot of things happen.

07:04.303 --> 07:07.541
You have a signal going
from your face to the brain

07:07.542 --> 07:10.078
which then sends a signal
to the adrenal gland.

07:10.079 --> 07:11.539
***

07:11.540 --> 07:14.370
***

07:14.371 --> 07:18.108
***

07:18.109 --> 07:22.420
Your eyes widely dilate so you
get clear and increased vision.

07:22.421 --> 07:25.195
***

07:25.196 --> 07:27.490
You can fight or flee.

07:28.089 --> 07:33.293
Narrator: Is old fight or flight
response isn't exactly unknown.

07:33.294 --> 07:36.353
One of my co-workers as a human shield.

07:36.354 --> 07:38.666
Narrator: But how can the
guys induce something akin

07:38.667 --> 07:42.446
to a sense of panic in order
to test out the myth?

07:44.122 --> 07:45.958
There could be a variety of tests,

07:45.959 --> 07:47.753
so if someone is compromised in some way,

07:47.754 --> 07:52.880
and they can be compromised
from a variety of sources,

07:52.881 --> 07:54.137
but to test that,

07:54.138 --> 07:58.036
you'd want to find some
fine psycho motor skill.

07:58.037 --> 07:58.793
Narrator: Back at the shop,

07:58.794 --> 08:01.320
Grant and Tory are we woulding up a storm.

08:01.321 --> 08:04.510
They're determined to take
the human equation out.

08:07.485 --> 08:09.233
We have a bungee cord attached.

08:09.234 --> 08:10.623
***

08:10.624 --> 08:12.894
***

08:12.895 --> 08:14.438
Don't want to use motors or pistons

08:14.439 --> 08:18.314
because we're going to be putting our
faces in the way of this slapping hand.

08:20.938 --> 08:24.677
Narrator: All this mechanical marvel
is missing is a hand to hit with,

08:24.678 --> 08:28.720
so they'll fashion a
surrogate forearm from Kari.

08:28.722 --> 08:30.229
Deceivingly hairy.

08:31.394 --> 08:33.063
It's like baby down.

08:35.953 --> 08:37.875
Narrator: The limb gets shaved,

08:38.092 --> 08:43.683
greased and plastered

08:43.683 --> 08:46.097
which sets to make a mold.

08:46.098 --> 08:47.016
In this case,

08:47.017 --> 08:50.859
the mold is filled with
silicon and when that sets,

08:51.050 --> 08:53.557
they can arm the robot.

08:55.251 --> 08:57.060
Oh, goodness.

08:57.061 --> 08:58.208
Here, Tory.

08:58.322 --> 08:59.631
Before we do that,

08:59.632 --> 09:02.010
need to find out how hard we slap.

09:02.011 --> 09:03.413
That's where this guy comes in.

09:03.414 --> 09:05.322
We're going slap the plate,

09:05.860 --> 09:09.308
record the data and use that
to calibrate our machine.

09:09.309 --> 09:10.858
Narrator: Grant strikes first.

09:10.859 --> 09:13.335
It's going to hurt you
more than it hurts me.

09:15.065 --> 09:16.023
Narrator: Then Tory.

09:17.830 --> 09:19.732
That looks more like a spank.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.298
Narrator: Then Kari steps up to the plate.

09:22.299 --> 09:24.511
***

09:24.512 --> 09:26.373
***

09:26.374 --> 09:28.658
this myth sucks, all right.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.366
Oh, maybe that was too hard.

09:32.367 --> 09:36.172
Narrator: Maybe it was, but
Grant's in no mood for a do over.

09:36.255 --> 09:38.659
You hit with 94,

09:40.636 --> 09:42.612
you hit with 116.

09:42.613 --> 09:46.042
Our average is 108 pounds.

09:52.411 --> 09:56.715
It's like I picked my own switch
off the tree to get spanked with.

09:56.716 --> 09:58.530
You ready?

09:58.959 --> 10:01.726
I take no pleasure in this whatsoever.

10:02.526 --> 10:05.344
In three, two, one...

10:07.572 --> 10:09.360
Did it hit a little high?

10:09.388 --> 10:11.627
It was the comeback that

10:11.628 --> 10:12.515
***

10:12.516 --> 10:13.640
***

10:13.793 --> 10:15.312
Narrator: The aim was array,

10:15.313 --> 10:16.010
but so far,

10:16.011 --> 10:19.269
the mechanical slap hits
right on the money.

10:20.340 --> 10:22.425
Kari's followed by Grant.

10:27.010 --> 10:28.437
And then Tory.

10:30.686 --> 10:32.445
That is really good.

10:32.446 --> 10:33.522
So, what do you think?

10:33.523 --> 10:34.861
I think it's perfect.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.866
It doesn't knock you out.

10:38.876 --> 10:41.047
That's just what they wanted.

10:44.856 --> 10:48.869
Narrator: One thing we know
is there's more pain to come.

10:49.886 --> 10:50.806
After the break,

10:50.807 --> 10:54.397
Adam and Jamie put their
theories into practice.

10:54.398 --> 10:56.986
Three, two, one.

11:01.939 --> 11:03.444
Narrator: In valkyrie boom,

11:03.445 --> 11:06.116
we've seen that a sealed
room should contain

11:06.117 --> 11:09.834
an explosion better than
a room with windows.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.281
Now, they're ready to do it
in a room with small scale.

11:15.015 --> 11:16.676
I need two rooms.

11:16.677 --> 11:20.751
One that is scaled exactly
correctly in all the details

11:22.494 --> 11:25.846
and another that's scaled
to the aboveground room

11:25.847 --> 11:27.575
where the explosion happened.

11:27.576 --> 11:32.532
I'm going to make them out
of half inch steel plate.

11:33.409 --> 11:35.442
This way, I won't be blowing them up.

11:35.443 --> 11:39.826
I'll be seeiing the difference of
the shock wave between the two.

11:39.827 --> 11:43.068
Narrator: In search of a
definitive yes or no,

11:43.069 --> 11:48.253
the focus is on the potential
of those explosive shock waves.

11:48.254 --> 11:49.570
***

11:49.571 --> 11:52.408
***

11:54.620 --> 11:55.227
T I got to tell you,

11:55.228 --> 12:00.193
this is the heaviest scale
model I've ever built.

12:03.021 --> 12:04.042
Come on, right here.

12:05.122 --> 12:09.650
Narrator: Now, there's no question that
blowing stuff up is best done outdoors

12:09.651 --> 12:12.139
and you know it's a big
day on the bomb range

12:12.140 --> 12:15.848
when explosives experts
Frank Doyle and j.D.

12:15.849 --> 12:18.933
Nelson are both there to help out.

12:21.349 --> 12:22.470
When we set up an explosion,

12:23.416 --> 12:26.315
the thing we're worried about

12:26.386 --> 12:31.053
a moving wall of

12:31.121 --> 12:37.664
when they're near a blast.

12:38.668 --> 12:40.077
Now, the question we're trying to answer,

12:40.078 --> 12:42.847
when we set off an explosion,

12:45.041 --> 12:49.847
will we contain that blast and see
an increase amount of pressure.

12:52.226 --> 12:53.690
***

12:53.691 --> 12:55.609
***

12:55.610 --> 12:58.265
***

12:58.266 --> 13:01.520
Narrator: Our testing will
be performed by this.

13:03.222 --> 13:08.108
This will be placed at a precise
distapt and converts the impulse,

13:11.044 --> 13:16.341
which will allow us to
compare the two blasts.

13:16.342 --> 13:20.188
Narrator: Providing the boom for
both rooms is a blasting pack.

13:20.189 --> 13:22.076
J.D.

13:22.077 --> 13:26.390
And Frank have chosen
two robust number tens.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.292
***

13:28.293 --> 13:30.104
***

13:30.105 --> 13:31.695
let mark it and tape it.

13:31.696 --> 13:35.238
Narrator: J.D. And Frank set up the same

13:35.239 --> 13:37.955
when the time comes to prime the bunker.

13:37.956 --> 13:39.701
Jamie, the cap's in place.

13:40.399 --> 13:42.646
Narrator: Hopefully,
safe behind the screen,

13:42.647 --> 13:45.869
Jamie counts down to the open room blast.

13:45.870 --> 13:51.426
And three, two, one... nice.

13:51.427 --> 13:53.039
Let's go look at the data.

13:53.882 --> 13:58.107
Narrator: The rooms are to
scale, but the charge isn't.

13:58.108 --> 13:59.685
We're not looking for damage,

13:59.686 --> 14:02.828
but the measure of pressure
induced by the blast.

14:02.829 --> 14:04.404
So, what's the data say?

14:04.405 --> 14:05.228
In the conference room,

14:05.229 --> 14:07.857
a peak pressure of 14 psi.

14:08.237 --> 14:08.903
Excellent.

14:08.904 --> 14:10.008
Let's do the other one.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.844
Narrator: So, it's off to the bunker
and just like the first room,

14:13.845 --> 14:16.274
this lodge needs a lid.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.074
Sounds like we're sealing a crypt.

14:19.075 --> 14:23.050
Narrator: That's kind of the whole
idea and with the roof welded tight,

14:23.051 --> 14:25.823
Jamie screws in the producer.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.473
This time around,

14:26.474 --> 14:32.399
it's a contained explosion and we
should see a higher psi in here.

14:32.463 --> 14:33.338
Here we go.

14:34.655 --> 14:39.497
Narrator: Now, J.D. And Frank ever
so carefully insert the explosive.

14:39.498 --> 14:40.461
When we're done,

14:40.468 --> 14:42.413
we're almost ready to blow.

14:42.986 --> 14:49.140
And three, two, one... doink.

14:50.476 --> 14:51.563
Narrator: Just like last time,

14:51.564 --> 14:54.130
the steel shell muffled the blast,

14:54.131 --> 14:57.028
but the drama is all in the data.

14:57.613 --> 14:58.920
What happened in the bunker?

14:58.921 --> 15:02.228
We got a peak pressure 55 psi.

15:02.229 --> 15:05.389
***

15:05.491 --> 15:06.067
***

15:06.068 --> 15:07.327
That's a result.

15:07.504 --> 15:08.438
It is.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.924
Narrator: As predicted,

15:09.925 --> 15:12.277
this potentially lethal pressure wave.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.717
Would do a lot more damage in the bunker,

15:14.718 --> 15:17.005
which is good news for the myth.

15:17.006 --> 15:19.257
I think there might be
something to this one.

15:19.258 --> 15:20.777
Where do you want to go from here?

15:20.778 --> 15:21.968
***

15:21.969 --> 15:23.584
***

15:23.633 --> 15:26.582
Narrator: Up next, Grant
suffers for science,

15:27.076 --> 15:28.974
but not in silence.

15:29.739 --> 15:31.173
On to the test.

15:34.898 --> 15:36.969
Narrator: With the robot
primed for action,

15:36.970 --> 15:40.580
the next mist is to run a series of test.

15:40.581 --> 15:42.581
***

15:41.533 --> 15:43.716
First, where the subject is normal,

15:43.717 --> 15:45.933
then impaired in some way,

15:45.934 --> 15:47.601
then impaired,

15:47.602 --> 15:48.872
then slapped.

15:48.873 --> 15:50.942
The man in the hot seat is Greg.

15:50.943 --> 15:54.526
Because this face under pressure was far

15:54.527 --> 15:58.315
and away the funniest and
here's what he's going to face.

15:58.598 --> 16:00.430
For a myth experiment,

16:00.431 --> 16:02.909
we have four challenge,

16:02.910 --> 16:04.438
we're going to test reflexes,

16:04.439 --> 16:08.254
coordination and visual skills.

16:08.255 --> 16:10.884
To make sure the slap
effect doesn't wear off,

16:10.885 --> 16:14.397
each task will only be
about a minute long.

16:15.256 --> 16:16.463
***

16:16.464 --> 16:17.183
Narrator: First up,

16:17.184 --> 16:21.510
Grant attempts all four tasks to
give us an unimpaired baseline.

16:24.688 --> 16:27.108
So, this is how the reflex
challenge is going to work.

16:30.260 --> 16:34.054
Above him, stars held up by magnets.

16:36.977 --> 16:41.270
His job is to catch stars
before they hit the ground.

16:41.271 --> 16:42.245
***

16:42.624 --> 16:44.042
***

16:44.043 --> 16:44.834
***

16:44.835 --> 16:45.719
***

16:45.915 --> 16:46.643
***

16:46.644 --> 16:47.238
***

16:47.239 --> 16:47.871
Eight out of eight.

16:47.872 --> 16:50.059
On to the next challenge.

16:51.003 --> 16:52.290
So, for the coordination challenge,

16:52.291 --> 16:54.956
a good, old fashioned shooting gallery

16:54.959 --> 16:58.628
with these air powered
rifles firing corks.

16:58.629 --> 17:01.825
60 seconds to load the rifle.

17:03.107 --> 17:03.998
Three.

17:04.001 --> 17:06.078
And shoot all six targets.

17:06.449 --> 17:07.397
Four.

17:10.646 --> 17:11.316
All right.

17:11.317 --> 17:13.123
You shot five out of six.

17:13.124 --> 17:14.181
Well done.

17:14.182 --> 17:15.074
Thank you.

17:15.259 --> 17:18.435
Narrator: Tests three and
four are a bit more cerebral.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.491
First, a communication challenge.

17:20.492 --> 17:25.164
As he and a blindfolded
Tory trying to make a pattern.

17:25.165 --> 17:26.434
***

17:26.435 --> 17:27.086
***

17:27.087 --> 17:28.327
***

17:28.535 --> 17:31.503
***

17:32.344 --> 17:33.671
For this exercise,

17:33.672 --> 17:35.338
there is a time limit,

17:35.339 --> 17:39.380
which poses no ed ty.

17:39.381 --> 17:42.045
With his brain firing at all cylinders,

17:42.046 --> 17:44.073
Grant scored predictably well.

17:44.074 --> 17:47.671
Now, it's time to dial
down his facu faculties.

17:47.672 --> 17:49.508
According to Dr. Sanders,

17:49.509 --> 17:53.265
one of the best and simplest
ways is to put him on ice.

17:57.392 --> 17:58.645
We're going to chill you.

17:58.646 --> 18:00.564
We're going to leave you
in here for half an hour,

18:02.891 --> 18:05.250
then pull you out and take the test.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.448
***

18:06.449 --> 18:07.313
***

18:07.314 --> 18:09.245
***

18:09.246 --> 18:13.146
We have a starting temperature of 97.1.

18:13.256 --> 18:14.150
Chill out.

18:14.181 --> 18:16.730
Oh, very funny.

18:16.731 --> 18:20.337
Narrator: They leave Grant
to shiver and speculate.

18:20.711 --> 18:23.593
Now, I've been in really
cold temperatures.

18:23.594 --> 18:26.609
The first thing that starts
to go is your motor skills,

18:26.610 --> 18:29.802
then your judgment.

18:29.803 --> 18:31.243
Narrator: When the half hour's up,

18:31.244 --> 18:34.255
Grant's lost seven degrees
of body temperature.

18:34.256 --> 18:36.745
That's verging on hypothermia area.

18:36.746 --> 18:38.650
***

18:38.651 --> 18:40.451
***

18:40.452 --> 18:42.455
***

18:44.106 --> 18:45.373
Ready for this challenge? I'm ready.

18:47.354 --> 18:48.956
Narrator: He starts with the targets.

18:48.957 --> 18:51.783
Last time, he was five from six.

18:53.793 --> 18:55.901
This time, it's three.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.824
Now I'm on the next challenge.

18:59.436 --> 19:00.861
Narrator: Next up is the math test

19:00.862 --> 19:04.322
and those numbers aren't tripping
off the tongue like last time.

19:08.634 --> 19:10.179
Like he's been drinking.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.830
210.

19:14.171 --> 19:16.254
Narrator: He scored nothing.

19:17.218 --> 19:17.912
Time's up.

19:17.913 --> 19:19.394
On to the next challenge.

19:19.395 --> 19:21.083
Coordination now?

19:21.084 --> 19:23.121
Narrator: It almost seems cruel,

19:23.122 --> 19:24.911
but that's science for you.

19:26.283 --> 19:32.659
One, two. Two out of eight.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.527
Last time, he got eight out of eight.

19:34.832 --> 19:38.397
Narrator: So, hopes are not
high for the last test.

19:40.286 --> 19:42.131
The seconds ticking by.

19:42.955 --> 19:44.071
To the right.

19:44.394 --> 19:47.429
Flip it clockwise.

19:47.430 --> 19:48.431
Clockwise.

19:48.457 --> 19:51.381
Narrator: And there's more
than one pattern emerging.

19:51.464 --> 19:53.887
Rotate clockwise and got it.

19:53.896 --> 19:54.803
Time.

19:54.976 --> 19:55.490
All right.

19:55.491 --> 19:59.613
Well, the results of the control test
are you're definitely compromised.

19:59.614 --> 20:04.714
Narrator: In fact, impaired Grant
was trounced by nonimpaired Grant.

20:04.825 --> 20:06.957
Now, for the fun stuff.

20:07.251 --> 20:09.645
Time to stick you back in the
freezer for a half hour,

20:09.646 --> 20:10.363
bring you out,

20:10.364 --> 20:12.996
slap you and do the test again.

20:13.141 --> 20:15.299
Narrator: Grant's warmed
up during testing,

20:15.300 --> 20:19.027
so it's back to the freezer
to inhibit his brain again.

20:23.206 --> 20:24.524
Row ready for the test?

20:27.735 --> 20:30.877
All right, Grant, have a seat
in the slapping machine.

20:30.887 --> 20:31.762
Okay.

20:32.358 --> 20:33.945
Oh, you are cold.

20:34.133 --> 20:37.088
All right, you ready to get
some sense slapped into you?

20:37.589 --> 20:38.544
Here we go.

20:42.478 --> 20:44.744
On to the reflexes test.

20:44.745 --> 20:49.987
Narrator: No time to lose as they don't
want the close or the slap to wear off.

20:51.758 --> 20:52.847
One.

20:52.848 --> 20:54.208
Two.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.439
Three.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.345
Four.

20:58.346 --> 20:59.775
Five. Pretty good.

20:59.776 --> 21:01.297
On to the next test.

21:01.298 --> 21:02.026
Narrator: But first,

21:02.027 --> 21:04.295
it's back in the truck for a tapa.

21:04.296 --> 21:07.056
A method they'll repeat between each test.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.222
First, the rechill, then the slap.

21:12.281 --> 21:14.394
All right. Quick, to the next challenge.

21:14.795 --> 21:15.637
On to math.

21:16.801 --> 21:17.877
Narrator: On the math quiz,

21:17.878 --> 21:19.432
well, it's hard to be sure,

21:19.433 --> 21:22.382
but he does seem more focused.

21:22.383 --> 21:23.800
Times ten is 70,

21:23.801 --> 21:25.659
divided by two is 35.

21:26.965 --> 21:27.953
That's time.

21:28.066 --> 21:29.214
Not as good as the practice,

21:29.215 --> 21:30.467
but better than the control.

21:30.468 --> 21:31.907
Own out of three.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.636
Narrator: It's fun to watch,

21:34.637 --> 21:38.070
but let's spare a thought for the
man with his face on the line.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.984
I'm starting to feel bad for him.

21:39.985 --> 21:42.327
....

21:45.201 --> 21:46.596
On to the test.

21:46.879 --> 21:47.768
Let's go.

21:48.244 --> 21:49.207
Narrator: Right about now,

21:49.208 --> 21:52.994
Kari and Tory are thankful
the gun only shoots torques.

21:52.995 --> 21:54.380
***

21:54.381 --> 21:57.150
***

21:57.151 --> 22:00.825
The fight of flight rush you get.

22:00.826 --> 22:04.551
I'm pretty sure that's what I
had because when I got slapped,

22:04.552 --> 22:07.824
I was ready to like jump
up and hit something.

22:07.825 --> 22:10.057
Narrator: So, with one
last and long shiver,

22:13.099 --> 22:15.810
Grant once again consorts with the enemy.

22:15.811 --> 22:17.242
Down to a lot more focus.

22:19.121 --> 22:20.912
Rotate back counterclockwise.

22:20.913 --> 22:24.262
Narrator: But is he on track
to beat the last time tryout?

22:24.263 --> 22:26.734
Only Kari knows for sure.

22:27.034 --> 22:29.066
***

22:29.067 --> 22:30.007
Not as good as the practice,

22:30.008 --> 22:32.338
but better than the control.

22:34.344 --> 22:36.886
Narrator: When Grant was
part crippled by cold,

22:36.887 --> 22:39.522
his performance fell off across the board.

22:39.523 --> 22:41.829
After the slap, he bounced back,

22:41.830 --> 22:45.693
but not far enough to match
his unimpaired baseline.

22:45.694 --> 22:48.732
I have to say that I
am starting to believe

22:48.733 --> 22:52.403
there's something to
slapping sense into someone.

22:54.098 --> 22:56.512
Narrator: Have we gone far
enough to prove the point?

22:56.513 --> 22:59.025
There's still room to ramp this one up

22:59.026 --> 23:02.717
and the bonus for Grant
is he'll get his revenge.

23:03.147 --> 23:06.293
Coming up, Adam and Jamie
find that building a bunker

23:06.294 --> 23:09.457
might be more dangerous
than blowing it up.

23:15.231 --> 23:15.903
So far, so good.

23:15.904 --> 23:18.607
Our small scale test seems
to be supporting the theory.

23:18.608 --> 23:20.561
I think it's time to go full scale.

23:21.502 --> 23:22.349
I agree.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.098
I've got an idea about that.

23:24.099 --> 23:27.747
Since the conventional wisdom
is all things being equal,

23:27.748 --> 23:29.514
the enclosed explosion is deadlier,

23:29.515 --> 23:31.567
let's make two things equal.

23:34.015 --> 23:36.266
Let's dress two containers the same.

23:36.267 --> 23:37.721
Same explosives,

23:38.489 --> 23:40.944
same table Hitler was at.

23:42.645 --> 23:44.248
In one, we cut windows,

23:44.249 --> 23:46.700
in the other, we bury it underground.

23:50.371 --> 23:51.625
I love it.

23:52.478 --> 23:55.770
Narrator: Back to the bomb range
to put this myth of the two rooms

23:55.771 --> 23:59.189
to the ultimate test.

23:59.584 --> 24:00.268
For this test,

24:00.269 --> 24:03.373
the role of our underground bunker
and aboveground conference room

24:03.374 --> 24:05.918
will be played by a pair
of truck containers.

24:08.843 --> 24:11.733
I've got to take one and put it into
position and cut some windows out of it.

24:11.734 --> 24:15.266
Narrator: It's a point of pride on the
show that when the going gets tough,

24:15.267 --> 24:17.785
we don't send out for the contractors.

24:17.786 --> 24:20.619
It's agreed the best way to
make a shipping container

24:20.620 --> 24:22.573
like an underground bunker

24:22.574 --> 24:26.621
is to slip it tight inside a dirt trench.

24:28.664 --> 24:31.310
Now that we've covered
feeding of the hein man,

24:31.311 --> 24:34.148
***

24:34.512 --> 24:37.502
***

24:37.503 --> 24:39.021
***

24:39.022 --> 24:40.926
***

24:40.927 --> 24:42.736
***

24:42.737 --> 24:43.720
so give... with farm equipment.

24:43.721 --> 24:45.578
***

24:45.579 --> 24:48.737
***

24:49.321 --> 24:51.812
Narrator: Now, let's see a Savage in his.

24:51.813 --> 24:54.249
***

24:54.250 --> 24:55.752
***

24:55.753 --> 24:57.747
***

24:57.748 --> 25:00.506
That container weighs two and a half tons,

25:00.507 --> 25:03.661
but Adam drops it pretty much on a dime.

25:04.001 --> 25:05.459
That doesn't look bad.

25:05.668 --> 25:06.554
Not gorgeous,

25:06.555 --> 25:10.235
but not bad.

25:10.236 --> 25:13.697
Narrator: Well, there's still time
enough to spruce up the old place.

25:13.698 --> 25:18.607
Item one is to mark up and
carve out some windows.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.560
Oh, that's nice.

25:23.948 --> 25:26.394
Narrator: Okay, so we can all
give thanks this this man

25:26.395 --> 25:28.054
never became a dentist,

25:28.055 --> 25:29.458
but you have to admit,

25:29.459 --> 25:31.488
he gets the job done.

25:35.451 --> 25:38.174
Can never tell whether those
things open in or out.

25:38.496 --> 25:39.670
Narrator: Back in the trenches,

25:39.671 --> 25:44.089
Jamie measures the depth
and breadth of his plot.

25:45.898 --> 25:49.067
Next on the schedule is
blazing the windows.

25:49.370 --> 25:50.708
I know what you're saying.

25:50.914 --> 25:52.026
You're saying,

25:52.027 --> 25:56.417
Adam, I'm pretty sure the Germans had
more sophisticated window technologies

25:56.418 --> 25:59.745
than duct tape and I agree.

25:59.746 --> 26:01.739
That's not what this test is about though.

26:01.740 --> 26:05.437
This is a purely relative
test testing an explosion

26:05.438 --> 26:08.771
in an enclosed space versus an open space.

26:08.772 --> 26:12.127
This is literally window dressing.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.568
Narrator: Over at the hole,

26:14.569 --> 26:17.413
Jamie's been weaving
his own kind of magic.

26:21.163 --> 26:21.677
Looks good.

26:21.678 --> 26:24.390
Narrator: It's packed in
and covered with earth

26:24.391 --> 26:27.531
to simulate Hitler's bunker in the woods.

26:27.736 --> 26:29.780
With preparations going so well,

26:29.781 --> 26:31.964
you can't help feeling that something,

26:31.965 --> 26:34.545
somewhere, is going to crack.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.298
Surprisingly, it's not Adam's windows,

26:37.299 --> 26:39.651
but Jamie's container.

26:41.123 --> 26:45.427
It's just what you don't want to hear
at the end of the long day's labor.

26:45.428 --> 26:47.012
I just heard a crunch.

26:47.013 --> 26:48.186
Oh, no.

26:48.281 --> 26:49.468
Have they opened it up yet?

26:49.469 --> 26:54.160
No. That would suck.

26:54.331 --> 26:57.894
Narrator: And that would
be an understatement.

26:59.508 --> 27:00.504
Did you hear that?

27:00.758 --> 27:02.511
I don't want to go in there.

27:02.934 --> 27:05.743
Narrator: Seems the problem
stems back to supply

27:05.744 --> 27:09.324
as they discovered this
container is part fiberglass

27:09.325 --> 27:11.805
and not as strong as the other one.

27:11.806 --> 27:12.708
Dude.

27:12.709 --> 27:13.414
I know.

27:13.415 --> 27:14.387
What do we do?

27:15.617 --> 27:16.693
Get another one.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.411
Narrator: It's a setback all right

27:18.412 --> 27:21.608
and with the full scale testing
set for tomorrow morning,

27:21.609 --> 27:25.488
someone needs to do something and fast.

27:25.489 --> 27:26.941
***

27:27.793 --> 27:28.764
Ahead,

27:28.765 --> 27:32.998
hungry, tired.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.511
Kari and Tory face the ultimate challenge.

27:43.742 --> 27:46.429
Grant's test shows the
slapping made a difference.

27:46.430 --> 27:49.173
Zbr I don't think think
we were thorough enough.

27:49.174 --> 27:50.776
***

27:50.777 --> 27:52.553
***

27:52.554 --> 27:54.502
I think we could add a couple more things.

27:54.503 --> 27:57.363
Sleep deprivation or hunger.

27:58.833 --> 28:01.355
And I think there was a
consequence to his error.

28:01.356 --> 28:03.562
***

28:03.563 --> 28:04.666
***

28:04.667 --> 28:06.650
***

28:06.651 --> 28:07.603
Perfect.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.762
But I have one change.

28:08.763 --> 28:11.937
This time, I administer the
test and you two get slapped.

28:11.938 --> 28:13.584
That's a terrible idea.

28:13.585 --> 28:15.294
I think we should take a vote.

28:15.295 --> 28:16.384
In favor of Grant...

28:16.385 --> 28:18.339
***

28:19.974 --> 28:21.350
***

28:21.351 --> 28:24.038
You two are getting slapped.

28:24.039 --> 28:27.774
Narrator: So they'll go a whole
day without food or sleep.

28:27.775 --> 28:30.849
And send time in the deep freeze.

28:30.850 --> 28:32.912
This should inhibit their brain function

28:32.913 --> 28:35.586
***

28:35.587 --> 28:37.660
***

28:37.661 --> 28:39.908
and taking the test to a shooting range

28:39.909 --> 28:42.953
means they'll be forced to
make quick fire decisions

28:42.954 --> 28:46.022
with potentially serious consequences.

28:46.641 --> 28:49.250
Okay, so this is our two-minute
shooting drill course.

28:49.251 --> 28:50.001
We're going to be putting,

28:50.002 --> 28:54.313
our frozen, tired and starving.

28:54.314 --> 28:55.550
***

28:55.551 --> 28:57.202
***

28:57.203 --> 28:58.374
***

28:58.375 --> 29:02.404
***

29:02.405 --> 29:05.324
Narrator: They'll have 30
rounds and on Grant's command,

29:05.325 --> 29:09.437
they'll advance twice down the
room to complete the test.

29:09.958 --> 29:12.026
These guns are real guns,

29:12.027 --> 29:14.050
but have been specially modified
have been specially modified.

29:14.051 --> 29:15.122
With the different barrel

29:15.123 --> 29:17.639
that allows them to fire these rounds,

29:17.640 --> 29:19.210
which are training rounds.

29:19.211 --> 29:21.085
***

29:21.086 --> 29:22.291
They're filled with paint.

29:24.341 --> 29:28.034
Narrator: Kari and Tory are
called on to assemble the robot.

29:28.035 --> 29:29.996
***

29:29.997 --> 29:32.128
***

29:32.129 --> 29:34.285
***

29:34.286 --> 29:37.496
How many times did I
get slapped yesterday?

29:37.659 --> 29:39.290
That looks good.

29:39.291 --> 29:40.400
***

29:40.401 --> 29:42.107
***

29:42.217 --> 29:47.665
Ice truck for 30 minutes to
consolidate their incapacity.

29:50.644 --> 29:51.930
To be scrupulous,

29:51.931 --> 29:55.029
Kari and Tory first ran
the course yesterday.

29:57.244 --> 30:00.808
They both fired 30 rounds
and missed just once.

30:00.809 --> 30:03.893
So that's our uninhibited baseline.

30:03.940 --> 30:07.492
Now, it's time to find out just
how impaired they've become,

30:07.493 --> 30:08.924
starting the Kari.

30:08.925 --> 30:12.545
Eyes on, pick up your firearm.

30:13.015 --> 30:15.493
I am really tired from tensing.

30:15.494 --> 30:19.179
Freezing cold, starving.

30:19.750 --> 30:20.598
Ready.

30:20.599 --> 30:21.940
And begin.

30:21.941 --> 30:23.692
I think I'm getting a headache.

30:24.054 --> 30:26.983
Narrator: So, she's less
than our usual bubby self,

30:26.984 --> 30:29.379
but will it impair her performance?

30:32.289 --> 30:38.109
I was shaking so much that I wouldn't
hold my gun straight and I was,

30:38.281 --> 30:40.845
it's like I can't concentrate.

30:42.685 --> 30:44.572
Just my head is tired.

30:44.573 --> 30:46.746
I can't focus.

30:47.363 --> 30:48.590
Narrator: At the end of the test,

30:48.591 --> 30:51.290
Kari hasn't shot any good guys.

30:55.501 --> 30:58.590
You fired a total of 19 rounds
and eight of them were hits.

30:58.591 --> 30:59.986
It's like an F.

31:01.163 --> 31:03.632
You were tired, hungry and cold.

31:03.633 --> 31:05.121
You were supposed to be impaired.

31:05.122 --> 31:06.570
Mission accomplished.

31:06.571 --> 31:08.339
Let's get to work.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.955
Narrator: Hungry, tired and chilled,

31:11.956 --> 31:13.265
.......

31:13.266 --> 31:15.047
Tory takes up the challenge.

31:17.729 --> 31:18.991
My fingers are getting numb.

31:18.992 --> 31:20.860
I'm starting to shiver.

31:20.996 --> 31:24.986
I can feel my muscles
tightening just to stay warm.

31:26.078 --> 31:28.313
If I can't feel my fingers,

31:28.314 --> 31:31.323
how am I going to feel the
gun to pull the trigger?

31:33.627 --> 31:35.944
Narrator: He does get
to grips with the gun,

31:35.945 --> 31:39.998
but just how many of those paint-filled
bullets have hit the targets?

31:41.604 --> 31:42.957
***

31:42.958 --> 31:43.555
***

31:43.556 --> 31:44.525
How did Tory do?

31:44.526 --> 31:45.797
***

31:45.798 --> 31:47.965
***

31:47.966 --> 31:49.974
Very well.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.049
Overall course,

31:51.050 --> 31:51.934
how did I do?

31:51.935 --> 31:54.447
Didn't hit any of the good guys,

31:54.448 --> 31:57.722
24 rounds and 21 hits.

31:59.407 --> 32:00.614
Narrator: Just like Kari,

32:00.615 --> 32:07.290
he did worse when affected by hunger and
cold and no sleep for a dachlt(?) now,

32:07.291 --> 32:12.662
we're ready to find out once and for
all if a slap makes a difference.

32:16.570 --> 32:19.854
Yesterday did not end
well for Adam and Jamie,

32:20.462 --> 32:21.245
but with a new,

32:21.246 --> 32:22.819
up to code container,

32:25.645 --> 32:27.405
it's all back on track.

32:27.406 --> 32:30.717
That gives Adam the chance
to explain his amazing dine

32:30.718 --> 32:32.969
for the real stars of the show.

32:35.937 --> 32:36.770
In my explosion,

32:36.771 --> 32:39.118
there's two things that
are going to kill you.

32:39.119 --> 32:42.629
One, the pressure wave
and two, the shrapnel.

32:42.630 --> 32:44.157
***

32:44.158 --> 32:47.219
***

32:47.220 --> 32:49.894
***

32:49.895 --> 32:54.402
It will have a pressure trans deucer
placed in the center of the chest front

32:56.755 --> 32:59.255
and back to pressure the
blast pressures coming off.

32:59.473 --> 33:04.954
It is ideal for measuring the
shrapnel injuries because anything

33:04.955 --> 33:08.006
that flies off this explosion

33:08.007 --> 33:09.682
is going to stick in this foam

33:09.683 --> 33:14.024
and give us a good idea of injuries
Hitler might have sustained.

33:14.025 --> 33:16.065
***

33:16.066 --> 33:18.960
Narrator: Is wires need protection.

33:18.961 --> 33:21.651
Hence, the two metal plates.

33:21.652 --> 33:23.069
If all goes to plan,

33:23.070 --> 33:26.893
the chest sensor will measure the bomb

33:26.894 --> 33:31.980
and back sensor will register shock waves.

33:32.199 --> 33:32.735
***

33:32.736 --> 33:35.989
***

33:35.990 --> 33:40.885
It's back to the bomb ranch to
hope in some alternative universe,

33:40.886 --> 33:43.767
the bomb in the bunker
would have killed Hitler.

33:43.768 --> 33:46.446
They'll begin by blowing
up the situation room

33:46.447 --> 33:51.489
and see if the damage
matches the event in 1944.

33:51.557 --> 33:55.037
In addition to our electronic data point,

33:55.038 --> 33:58.888
we're grabbing analog
data point with this.

33:58.889 --> 34:00.663
.....

34:00.664 --> 34:04.971
This is set at 100 psi and if
this bursts, equals death.

34:07.374 --> 34:10.043
Narrator: With all the equipment
in place and in check,

34:10.043 --> 34:14.996
they measure a precise chunk.

34:14.998 --> 34:16.556
975 grams.

34:16.558 --> 34:17.500
***

34:17.501 --> 34:18.679
***

34:19.958 --> 34:20.827
Good to go.

34:20.828 --> 34:21.971
Narrator: Inside the room,

34:21.972 --> 34:24.822
the last act of sedition is
to connect the explosive

34:24.822 --> 34:27.880
to a fire mechanism in a safety bunker.

34:29.295 --> 34:31.004
There's a lot riding on the result.

34:31.005 --> 34:33.627
To validate is upcoming test,

34:33.628 --> 34:39.386
they need to blast to be almost identical
to the one that killed Hitler.

34:42.210 --> 34:47.792
And three, two, one... boom.

34:54.581 --> 34:56.022
I wouldn't want to be in that room.

34:57.339 --> 35:00.463
Narrator: It's hard to imagine
anyone surviving this,

35:00.464 --> 35:02.078
but that's what they're hoping.

35:02.079 --> 35:03.851
We got a new doorway.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.751
It did what it said it
would do to the floor.

35:08.752 --> 35:10.385
There's a hole there.

35:11.630 --> 35:13.480
Wow, look at that.

35:13.481 --> 35:16.679
Three rather large chunks.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.398
Burst disked,

35:19.399 --> 35:20.520
absolutely,

35:20.521 --> 35:21.203
look at that.

35:21.204 --> 35:22.817
Totally intact.

35:22.852 --> 35:26.514
Narrator: So, they know the
blast was less than 100 psi

35:26.537 --> 35:29.584
and Hitler is a lot
healthier than we hooks.

35:29.585 --> 35:33.908
It is clear that while he might have
taken a lot of damage from splinters...

35:33.909 --> 35:35.605
***

35:35.606 --> 35:36.892
***

35:36.893 --> 35:38.905
***

35:38.906 --> 35:41.337
He had splinters in his legs,

35:41.338 --> 35:42.792
but from the waist up,

35:42.856 --> 35:43.964
he's pretty well in tact.

35:43.965 --> 35:46.018
***

35:46.019 --> 35:47.941
***

35:47.942 --> 35:49.592
***

35:49.593 --> 35:51.468
Kudos on a good control.

35:52.311 --> 35:55.215
Narrator: In fact, it looks
like a great control.

35:55.216 --> 35:58.338
But will David's figures
confirm the nonkill?

36:01.151 --> 36:04.471
We had an average of 18 psi
for just over a millisecond,

36:02.076 --> 36:04.423
***

36:04.472 --> 36:05.972
Which is survivable.

36:08.924 --> 36:13.725
Our figures show he could
have survived this blast.

36:13.726 --> 36:14.742
***

36:14.743 --> 36:16.615
***

36:17.298 --> 36:19.661
***

36:20.116 --> 36:22.440
This couldn't have gone better.

36:24.264 --> 36:25.041
Now, the question is,

36:25.042 --> 36:29.743
what will happen in the underground
bunker when we contain that blast?

36:30.341 --> 36:31.336
Narrator: Still to come,

36:31.337 --> 36:32.424
what would have happened
with the would have happened

36:32.425 --> 36:34.543
with the bomb and the bunker.

36:40.716 --> 36:42.851
Narrator: A slap in the
face can be painful,

36:42.852 --> 36:45.346
surprising and down right disturbing,

36:45.347 --> 36:48.510
but can it be used to focus your brain?

36:50.450 --> 36:52.381
We're about to find out cht.

36:52.513 --> 36:53.701
Sorry, Kari.

36:57.641 --> 36:59.518
Good, good.

36:59.703 --> 37:00.693
How you feeling?

37:01.149 --> 37:02.947
Like I just got smacked.

37:03.903 --> 37:06.680
Narrator: Be will she improve or imploed?

37:06.681 --> 37:08.216
Let's beginning the testing.

37:10.414 --> 37:12.992
And let Kari handle the commentary.

37:12.993 --> 37:16.398
It really focused me,

37:16.399 --> 37:21.924
I feel it was a lot harder than
when we calibrated originally.

37:21.925 --> 37:26.515
I don't know if I'm just really
cold, irritated, starving.

37:29.598 --> 37:30.612
She did really well.

37:30.613 --> 37:34.214
22 rounds and 16 on target.

37:34.215 --> 37:37.869
A big improvement and no good gu guys.

37:37.870 --> 37:42.156
Narrator: Kari scored well
enough to prop up the myth.

37:42.157 --> 37:44.236
Now, it's all down to Tory.

37:44.237 --> 37:46.954
How you feeling?

37:47.331 --> 37:52.499
Cool, disoriented, foggy in the head.

37:53.015 --> 37:53.949
Okay.

38:00.783 --> 38:01.849
Let's do this.

38:03.230 --> 38:03.755
Ready.

38:03.756 --> 38:04.634
Okay.

38:04.700 --> 38:06.033
And begin.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.306
Narrator: Grant starts the test that
will hopefully settle this once

38:09.307 --> 38:10.232
and for all.

38:10.315 --> 38:14.002
I am so surprised at how I felt before,

38:14.003 --> 38:15.045
during and after the slap.

38:15.046 --> 38:18.621
Instantly,

38:18.622 --> 38:23.809
I feel awake an alive and like I moved
through the course a lot better.

38:26.996 --> 38:28.573
What are the results?

38:28.574 --> 38:29.287
Really good.

38:29.288 --> 38:31.650
Tory got 27 shots,

38:31.651 --> 38:33.786
26 on target.

38:36.785 --> 38:39.215
Narrator: They never got back to
their unimpaired bench lines,

38:39.216 --> 38:40.985
but that's not the benchmark.

38:40.986 --> 38:41.842
***

38:41.843 --> 38:45.756
***

38:45.757 --> 38:46.820
Zpl your results,

38:46.821 --> 38:48.838
mine and his,

38:48.839 --> 38:50.453
I think we can call this confirmed.

38:50.454 --> 38:56.011
All were compromised and had significant
improvement after being slapped.

39:01.458 --> 39:03.317
Confirmed.

39:08.953 --> 39:10.328
Has this happened to you?

39:10.329 --> 39:16.312
Are allied farmers interrupting
you with pesky meetings?

39:20.328 --> 39:22.827
Have we got a solution for you.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.543
Narrator: After making
their five easy payments,

39:25.544 --> 39:27.529
they've gotten the container they want.

39:27.530 --> 39:30.643
It's been partially buried,

39:30.644 --> 39:32.914
but they're careful
to make sure the fittings,

39:32.915 --> 39:38.874
props are the same as they
were in the last test.

39:39.022 --> 39:40.027
Thank you, sir.

39:40.528 --> 39:43.414
The only thing that is
different is the room.

39:45.806 --> 39:47.897
When we see a pressure wave,

39:47.898 --> 39:49.777
it doesn't have anywhere to go.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.328
***

39:53.032 --> 39:53.871
Yes.

39:54.164 --> 39:54.876
Cool.

39:54.877 --> 39:56.037
Let's seal it up.

39:56.038 --> 39:59.472
Narrator: The closest thing they have
to a weak point is the front door,

39:59.473 --> 40:00.464
to Jamie,

40:00.465 --> 40:04.098
perhaps recalling his days building
the trans continental railroad.

40:04.099 --> 40:07.882
.........

40:07.883 --> 40:10.802
Now, to retread the trail of destruction.

40:10.803 --> 40:12.780
***

40:12.781 --> 40:14.856
***

40:14.857 --> 40:19.683
A fine explosion would yield
a higher blast pressure

40:19.684 --> 40:21.598
and in our full scale baseline,

40:24.491 --> 40:26.798
the attempt and show that it was
completely survivable. Would you?

40:26.799 --> 40:29.127
Narrator: But would anyone with
stand a ghost of a chance?

40:29.128 --> 40:30.504
***

40:30.505 --> 40:33.211
***

40:33.212 --> 40:38.987
To confirm, they need to kill Hitler
beyond any shadow of a doubt.

40:38.988 --> 40:43.763
In three, two, one... oh!

40:47.873 --> 40:49.699
I think the doors are open.

40:51.577 --> 40:53.710
We've exposed the creamy center.

40:54.489 --> 40:56.439
The bunker looks in tact though.

41:01.940 --> 41:05.293
Narrator: The bomb blew
the sleepers 150 feet,

41:05.294 --> 41:07.717
so it's no surprise that inside,

41:07.718 --> 41:09.412
it's a train wreck,

41:09.413 --> 41:12.506
but there's one more shock wave to come.

41:13.818 --> 41:15.378
The first test,

41:15.379 --> 41:16.869
totally intact.

41:17.648 --> 41:18.514
I would not have called it.

41:18.515 --> 41:20.077
Look at this place.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.202
Narrator: It does look like the
guys have blown their deposit.

41:24.403 --> 41:27.014
There's nothing left but splinters.

41:27.015 --> 41:31.228
Narrator: But the stats on survey
verifiability rest with David.

41:32.464 --> 41:35.936
We got an average just
over one millisecond.

41:35.937 --> 41:36.887
That's it?

41:36.888 --> 41:37.480
That's it.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.739
Narrator: It's close to
an unbelievable result.

41:42.740 --> 41:47.068
While the pressure wave could be lethal,

41:47.069 --> 41:50.245
it would have to last for
at least 30 milliseconds

41:50.246 --> 41:52.899
and this blast didn't come close.

41:52.900 --> 41:56.245
GI people ask us all the time if you
come up with results on the show

41:56.246 --> 42:00.384
that surprise us and here
is a fantastic example.

42:01.765 --> 42:04.920
We went into this explosion
pretty much feeling like Hitler.

42:04.921 --> 42:07.728
Was going to die and all of
our data shows the opposite.

42:07.729 --> 42:10.887
That this was the survivalable blast.

42:15.046 --> 42:16.265
That was surprising.

42:16.266 --> 42:17.396
Totally.

42:17.397 --> 42:19.526
I was convinced that
Hitler was going to die.

42:19.527 --> 42:20.419
Let's go.

42:21.541 --> 42:23.378
We should have used more explosives.

42:23.379 --> 42:25.271
That's your answer for everything.

42:28.191 --> 42:29.871
I loved these results.

42:29.872 --> 42:32.334
If you were standing where Hitler
was in relation to the blast,

42:32.335 --> 42:33.489
you would have survived.

42:37.478 --> 42:41.801
The myth that Hitler only survived because
of the change of venue is busted.

42:44.017 --> 42:45.869
Now, if the bomb had been at his feet,

42:47.447 --> 42:49.653
we might have a different story.

42:49.697 --> 42:50.405
Placement of the bomb,

42:50.406 --> 42:54.204
quantity of explosives much
more important than the room.

42:54.205 --> 42:57.752
I just love the counterintuitiveness.

42:57.753 --> 42:58.645
I do, too.
