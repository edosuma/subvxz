02:14.753 --> 02:16.003
How's it look?

02:16.003 --> 02:18.462
Like a New Mexican shithole.

02:18.753 --> 02:20.920
Perfect spot for a nest.

02:27.170 --> 02:29.253
Let's hit it.

05:07.170 --> 05:09.087
All right. Gio?

05:10.212 --> 05:12.795
Bene dica vow omnipotens deus.

05:12.795 --> 05:17.045
In nomine Patrius, et Filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.

05:17.045 --> 05:18.712
- Amen.
- Everything set?

05:18.712 --> 05:20.170
Ready, boss.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.545
Alright, we think we got
a nest inside this place.

05:22.753 --> 05:25.087
Figure at least six goons,
maybe more.

05:25.087 --> 05:27.337
Chances are, we'll find
the master in there somewhere.

05:27.337 --> 05:30.128
Rule number five: If you find
the nest you find the master.

05:30.128 --> 05:31.962
He usually won't leave it
on it's own.

05:31.962 --> 05:33.878
So it's strictly by
the book today, gentlemen.

05:33.878 --> 05:35.253
Questions?

05:38.545 --> 05:40.712
Let's get to work.

06:42.295 --> 06:45.212
- I'll do it, boss.
- My turn.

08:06.628 --> 08:08.087
Anthony?

08:08.087 --> 08:10.503
Easy with that door.
Slow...

08:10.670 --> 08:11.753
and easy.

08:11.753 --> 08:14.045
Sorry, boss.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.878
Jesus!

08:24.462 --> 08:26.670
- What was that?
- I don't know.

08:35.669 --> 08:37.337
Did I wake you up
out there, Montoya?

08:37.962 --> 08:40.712
Relax. Dead body. Bled out
and cold. one on.

08:40.712 --> 08:43.212
Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

08:43.503 --> 08:45.712
Suck it up.

09:53.795 --> 09:55.378
Bambi!

09:55.837 --> 09:57.128
Get it off!

09:57.128 --> 09:59.087
Wait! Hold your fire!

09:59.087 --> 10:01.337
Get it off now!

10:05.920 --> 10:07.795
Now! Fire!

10:16.587 --> 10:17.587
What?

10:17.587 --> 10:19.462
I don't know, Padre.
Hang on a minute.

10:22.170 --> 10:24.503
What's going on
in there, boys?

10:28.087 --> 10:30.920
Hello, fucking Deyo,
what's going on in there?

10:30.920 --> 10:33.545
Yeah, we got a live one.
Female goon.

10:35.128 --> 10:37.295
We'll save her
for you, Montoya.

10:41.628 --> 10:43.087
Open wide, baby.

10:53.337 --> 10:55.045
Go Anthony, stick her!

10:57.253 --> 11:00.920
- Clear! Take that!
- Fire!

11:02.795 --> 11:04.795
Ortega, we got a fish!
Go! Go!

11:04.837 --> 11:06.587
Go Montoya.

11:12.503 --> 11:14.128
We're losing him!

11:14.253 --> 11:15.837
Bambi, reload!

11:22.587 --> 11:24.462
Shit!

11:30.170 --> 11:31.337
Catlin!

11:31.337 --> 11:32.503
Safety on, boss!

11:32.503 --> 11:34.503
- Got it?
- Clear! Clear!

11:39.420 --> 11:40.753
Oh, Lord.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.712
Take over.

11:56.753 --> 11:59.045
Come on! Right here.

12:01.878 --> 12:02.962
Die!

12:02.962 --> 12:04.878
Die!

12:08.503 --> 12:11.753
Fucking die! Die!

12:17.920 --> 12:21.003
Fuck it! Not only ugly,
he smells bad. Oh, Jeez!

12:21.003 --> 12:23.003
Give me the radio.

12:23.378 --> 12:25.837
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, boss.

12:25.837 --> 12:28.962
Got another one. He's dead.
Send in the cable.

12:28.962 --> 12:30.962
Yeah, give me a minute, alright?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.878
May her soul and the souls
of all the departed...

12:34.878 --> 12:37.753
with the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

12:37.753 --> 12:39.670
Amen.

12:49.462 --> 12:52.378
Nothing like a little head,
eh, Padre?

13:01.420 --> 13:04.462
Okay, boys.
Time to mop it up.

13:04.462 --> 13:07.753
Deyo, Ortega, Bambi. Upstairs.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.420
Catlin, Anthony, Davis.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.337
Basement.

13:29.545 --> 13:32.587
Enjoy the barbecue, baby!

14:17.087 --> 14:18.712
One, two, three, four...

14:18.712 --> 14:20.337
five, six, seven, eight...

14:20.337 --> 14:23.545
nine!...
Goons, man!

14:23.545 --> 14:26.545
It's not a bad day's work.

14:26.628 --> 14:29.337
- You the man!
- Look.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.337
What is it, Jack?
Is something wrong?

14:33.337 --> 14:36.253
Yeah...
Where was the master?

14:36.253 --> 14:37.878
Want us to check it out
one more time?

14:37.878 --> 14:39.253
He's not there.

14:41.545 --> 14:45.087
You don't suppose there's
another nest somewhere, do you?

14:45.920 --> 14:48.420
Sure as hell
better not be.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.462
All right.

14:49.462 --> 14:52.378
- Let's get outta here.
- Get the hookers!

15:36.045 --> 15:37.878
Thank you for all your help.

15:37.878 --> 15:39.628
Yeah Father, I've spent
the last two weeks...

15:39.628 --> 15:41.920
running whores and buying
liquor for these fellows.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.003
- When are they gonna leave?
- We're clearing out tomorrow.

15:45.003 --> 15:47.795
I can't say that
I'm sorry to hear it.

15:49.462 --> 15:51.878
You get that
little package from us?

15:51.878 --> 15:53.212
Yeah, I got it.

15:53.212 --> 15:55.087
Good, then you're happy.

15:55.087 --> 15:57.045
You all work together?

15:57.045 --> 15:58.962
That's right.

15:58.962 --> 16:00.837
What'd you do?

16:00.837 --> 16:02.878
We kill vampires.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.462
I briefed Rome. They're wiring
a payment tomorrow, okay?

16:05.462 --> 16:08.212
- Thanks, Gio.
- Also Cardinal Alba's flying in.

16:08.212 --> 16:10.920
- He wants to meet with you tomorrow.
- Tomorrow is my day off.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.253
Jack... Not anymore.

16:15.503 --> 16:17.545
What'd you think
happened to the master?

16:17.545 --> 16:19.462
I don't know, Padre.

16:19.462 --> 16:22.295
A master won't leave
a nest filled with goons.

16:22.295 --> 16:25.628
What says he's still in New Mexico?
He could be anywhere by now.

16:25.628 --> 16:29.045
Why would he run? It's not
like he knew we were coming.

16:29.045 --> 16:31.212
No, really.
What'd you guys do?

16:31.212 --> 16:34.545
I'm not kidding.
We kill vampires.

16:34.545 --> 16:37.045
Hey, Catlin, tell the lady
what we do for a living.

16:37.045 --> 16:39.545
Kill vampires. Hunt them down.

16:39.545 --> 16:42.045
Kick the shit outta them.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.337
Right.

16:45.337 --> 16:49.420
I know how you feel, baby.
Nobody believes in vampires.

16:49.420 --> 16:54.003
See, the thing is, we know
vampires are stalking the earth.

16:54.003 --> 16:56.295
We also know there's a God too.

16:56.295 --> 16:59.462
We just don't understand him.

17:00.503 --> 17:02.795
Nice party.

17:03.878 --> 17:05.377
Yeah.

17:07.502 --> 17:11.462
You look like you got something
other than me on your mind.

17:11.462 --> 17:13.837
Feel like telling me about it?

17:15.420 --> 17:18.170
I was looking for something
I didn't find.

17:20.837 --> 17:23.252
- That can be a pain in the ass.
- Yeah.

17:28.420 --> 17:31.753
Maybe you should try
looking somewhere else?

17:33.128 --> 17:36.128
I can tell you where you
might wanna start.

17:36.753 --> 17:39.253
Well, Jesus, you're right.

17:40.295 --> 17:43.878
I should've been looking in
a whole different place.

17:47.253 --> 17:50.170
So why don't you get me
something to drink?

17:50.170 --> 17:53.295
And we can meet back in your...

17:53.295 --> 17:55.503
room.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.045
That's the first good idea
I heard today.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.795
Deyo, give me a couple beers,
will you?

18:55.420 --> 18:59.045
You're magnificent, you know?
Have I ever told you that?

18:59.045 --> 19:02.128
- Slow down, Padre.
- No, no, I'm... I'm not drunk.

19:02.128 --> 19:03.378
- Oh, really?
- No.

19:03.378 --> 19:05.503
What are you on, acid?

19:37.295 --> 19:39.503
Doesn't it feel beautiful?

19:39.587 --> 19:42.587
Something you'll never forget.

19:43.003 --> 19:45.503
I know I won't.

19:58.628 --> 20:01.962
- I think we're outta beer.
- Are we now.

20:01.962 --> 20:05.503
I think we ought to
knock over a liquor store.

20:05.503 --> 20:08.628
Hell, why not?
I don't give a shit anymore.

20:08.628 --> 20:12.545
Oh, no, no, no, no...
I... I... I'm...

20:12.545 --> 20:15.170
I... got beer.

20:15.170 --> 20:17.378
Got beer in the other room.

20:17.378 --> 20:21.962
Fucking people. I don't know why
I gotta take care of everybody.

20:23.753 --> 20:25.503
And you.

20:25.587 --> 20:28.212
You...
You don't go anywhere.

20:28.378 --> 20:31.337
- I got plans for you.
- You do?

22:06.587 --> 22:08.837
Jack Crow.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.503
No!

22:37.837 --> 22:40.545
- Quick! The pickup.
- Keys!

22:42.337 --> 22:44.878
Come on! Come with me!

22:46.378 --> 22:48.295
Did he bite you?

22:48.545 --> 22:49.712
Wait!

22:49.712 --> 22:51.795
I can use you.
Come here.

22:52.003 --> 22:53.628
Come on!

22:53.628 --> 22:55.420
Leave her!
She's fucking dead anyway!

22:55.420 --> 22:58.670
Just take her.
I can use her. Go!

23:06.253 --> 23:08.712
Step on it, goddamn it!

23:12.462 --> 23:14.253
- Hit it!
- I'm going!

23:22.212 --> 23:23.753
He's right behind us!

23:23.753 --> 23:25.587
Come on! Go!

23:33.837 --> 23:35.378
Kill him!

24:42.503 --> 24:44.503
You okay?

24:52.337 --> 24:53.670
Can you walk?

24:54.170 --> 24:56.378
You alive? Come on!

24:57.003 --> 24:59.087
Come on.
Come on.

24:59.087 --> 25:02.170
- What're you doing?
- She's going with us.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.587
He just bit her, man!

25:04.587 --> 25:06.378
- She hasn't turned yet.
- Well...

25:06.378 --> 25:08.128
she's on her way!

25:08.128 --> 25:11.170
It's under 48 hours, the telepathic
link with the master won't hold.

25:11.170 --> 25:12.378
So what!

25:12.378 --> 25:15.753
She'll start receiving his
thoughts, seeing what he sees!

25:15.753 --> 25:18.212
Exactly.
Like a surveillance camera.

25:18.212 --> 25:21.170
So we can find him and shove
a stick right up his ass!

25:21.170 --> 25:22.628
I'm gonna use
this piece of shit...

25:22.628 --> 25:25.253
to get to the master
and whoever tipped him off.

25:25.253 --> 25:28.253
I know we were set up.
He knew my fucking name!

25:28.253 --> 25:30.087
- Come on.
- Who set us up?

25:30.087 --> 25:33.003
I don't know,
but I want the son of a bitch.

25:33.003 --> 25:34.295
Can you walk?
Hey!

25:34.295 --> 25:37.420
Wake up! Can you walk?
Are you with me?

25:37.920 --> 25:39.462
Come on!

25:39.462 --> 25:41.920
Do you hear me?
Well?

25:42.170 --> 25:45.670
This ain't my first time
to the dance. Let's go.

27:35.212 --> 27:37.212
Hey, cowboy!

27:38.628 --> 27:39.712
Can I help you?

27:39.712 --> 27:41.545
I have to borrow your car.

27:43.753 --> 27:45.170
Just say, "Help yourself".

27:45.170 --> 27:48.087
- You want me to say what?
- Shut the fuck up! Or..

27:48.087 --> 27:50.462
I'll blow your fucking teeth outta
the back of your head, asshole.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.420
Back off!

27:52.545 --> 27:53.878
Help yourself, boy.

27:53.878 --> 27:56.503
Much obliged, partner.

28:03.545 --> 28:05.212
Let's go!

28:10.337 --> 28:12.087
Get in!

28:52.087 --> 28:55.253
Take her to Apache Springs.
Plaza Hotel.

28:55.253 --> 28:57.878
Hole up there. I'll find you
as soon as I can.

28:58.337 --> 29:02.128
- Dump this thing. Take the Jeep.
- You can't bury 'em all, Jack.

29:02.545 --> 29:05.670
- Get going.
- I need to talk to you!

29:05.670 --> 29:07.420
We're wasting time!

29:07.420 --> 29:09.337
Rule number seven:

29:09.587 --> 29:11.462
Never bury a team member
by yourself.

29:11.462 --> 29:13.378
This comes under
special circumstances.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.878
The whole fucking team's
been slaughtered!

29:14.878 --> 29:18.837
- I can handle it!
- Bullshit! You know better.

29:22.503 --> 29:24.003
- You got any bright ideas?
- Yeah...

29:24.003 --> 29:28.045
we kill the whore, bury the team
togather and head back to Monterey.

29:35.503 --> 29:36.795
If you wanna pull out...

29:36.795 --> 29:38.837
- go ahead.
- I didn't say that.

29:38.837 --> 29:42.295
Somebody's changed the rules.
We gotta do whatever it takes.

29:42.295 --> 29:44.587
We got less than 11 hours,
till the sun goes down.

29:44.587 --> 29:47.628
If you got something else to say,
spit it the fuck out!

29:47.628 --> 29:51.545
Yeah, I got something else to say.
Don't take too fucking long!

29:53.962 --> 29:56.795
I get nervous
when you're not around.

33:31.170 --> 33:34.462
- I gonna need a room, guy.
- For how long?

33:34.462 --> 33:39.587
- A few days.
- It's 375 dollars a week.

33:39.587 --> 33:43.003
Plus 25 dollars
for the cable TV.

33:46.795 --> 33:50.420
- What's the fucking total, guy?
- That's... huh, 400 dollars.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.295
Is that your girlfriend?

33:52.295 --> 33:55.337
No, it's my fucking mother.
Give me the key.

34:02.212 --> 34:03.878
Hey!

34:03.878 --> 34:07.003
Come on. Take my arm.

34:13.878 --> 34:17.212
Hey, wake up, will you?
Let's go!

34:18.045 --> 34:19.378
Jack Crow.

34:19.670 --> 34:23.962
Cerritos at 14th and Santa Fe.
Need immediate pickup.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.795
None of 'em.

34:27.087 --> 34:29.087
I'm alone.

34:29.795 --> 34:31.587
Dead.

34:32.420 --> 34:36.587
Sources into the investigation report
that all the bodies were decapitated.

34:36.670 --> 34:40.462
The heads were found buried
a mile from the murder scene.

34:40.462 --> 34:43.337
The number of confirmed dead
now stands at 19...

34:43.337 --> 34:45.837
with police still combing
the ruins of the motel.

34:45.837 --> 34:47.878
Of course, we'll be
standing by here all day...

34:47.878 --> 34:50.462
to bring you
any further updates.

35:40.045 --> 35:41.587
Forget it.

35:46.795 --> 35:49.003
Ahh... Jack.

35:49.295 --> 35:50.878
Buon giorno.

35:50.878 --> 35:54.128
Come...
Please sit down.

35:59.087 --> 36:00.295
Who's this?

36:00.295 --> 36:01.462
Oh, this is, uh...

36:01.462 --> 36:04.003
Father Adam Guiteau.

36:04.003 --> 36:07.628
Father Adam's in charge
of our archives. A...

36:07.628 --> 36:09.837
bookworm.

36:09.837 --> 36:12.587
And he's completely familiar
with all your activities...

36:12.587 --> 36:14.503
so speak freely.

36:14.503 --> 36:17.420
Tell me what happened.

36:19.212 --> 36:21.378
We cleaned out the nest.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.753
And the master showed up.

36:23.753 --> 36:25.378
No master was ever like this.

36:25.378 --> 36:27.878
Superhuman strength.
Unkillable, like a machine.

36:28.253 --> 36:31.837
We didn't stand a chance.
So, tell me if I'm wrong, cardinal...

36:31.837 --> 36:33.837
but couldn't he be the one,
we always talked about?

36:33.837 --> 36:36.045
The one we knew would
come along one day?

36:36.045 --> 36:38.628
There are
some other developments.

36:38.628 --> 36:41.795
Sad developments.

36:42.003 --> 36:43.878
Tom.

36:44.420 --> 36:48.878
Our Tom. Our Tom Callahan.
He's dead.

36:49.712 --> 36:53.337
And the whole European team
is wiped out.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.420
When?

36:54.420 --> 36:55.670
Three days ago.

36:55.670 --> 36:59.045
Callahans' team was clearing
a large nest in Cologne, Germany.

36:59.087 --> 37:03.253
Local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act.

37:06.045 --> 37:08.212
We found this at the site.

37:13.003 --> 37:15.587
Is he the one?

37:17.045 --> 37:18.795
Yes.

37:22.378 --> 37:23.712
What is this?

37:23.712 --> 37:25.003
A... Celebratum.

37:25.003 --> 37:28.045
It's... uh, medieval Latin,
for "celebrate".

37:28.045 --> 37:29.295
"Celebrate this".

37:29.295 --> 37:32.753
- Celebrate what?
- Well, uh...

37:33.378 --> 37:34.920
We don't know.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.920
I've authenticated the portrait.
It was painted in 1340.

37:37.920 --> 37:40.420
The subject's name is...
was... Valek.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.962
Jan Valek, born in Prague, 1311.
He was a priest...

37:43.962 --> 37:46.712
who turned against the Church
and led Bohemian peasants...

37:46.712 --> 37:49.920
in an uprising, actually
capturing several small towns.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.337
Valek was captured.

37:51.337 --> 37:53.795
He was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake.

37:53.795 --> 37:54.962
But...

37:54.962 --> 37:56.545
after his death
there were reports...

37:56.545 --> 37:58.962
that he was seen
walking at night.

37:58.962 --> 38:01.587
It was said he killed the
living to drink their blood.

38:01.587 --> 38:04.878
They opened his grave,
and it was found empty.

38:04.878 --> 38:07.212
It's the first known case
of vampirism.

38:07.337 --> 38:09.087
A priest.

38:09.503 --> 38:12.628
Valek is not like the other
masters you've hunted before.

38:12.628 --> 38:15.253
He is the first...
and most powerful.

38:15.253 --> 38:19.295
Of our slayers, you are
the only one who faced Valek...

38:19.295 --> 38:21.587
and survived.

38:22.420 --> 38:24.128
I'm going back out.

38:24.128 --> 38:26.337
- You mind if I hang on to this?
- Jack...

38:26.337 --> 38:30.378
I've been in contact with Rome.
The Vatican Council requests...

38:30.378 --> 38:33.170
that you rebuild
your team.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.253
- There isn't time.
- You're to return to Monterey...

38:36.253 --> 38:38.670
recruit new team members...

38:38.670 --> 38:41.795
and try again when
you are at full strength.

38:41.962 --> 38:45.420
Father Adam will accompany you
and take the place...

38:45.420 --> 38:48.212
of poor Father Giovanni.

38:48.212 --> 38:50.420
I don't think so.

38:51.045 --> 38:52.920
Jack!

38:52.920 --> 38:54.378
Jack!

38:55.087 --> 38:56.878
This is nonnegotiable.

38:56.878 --> 39:00.545
Valek is the original.
The source of the disease.

39:00.545 --> 39:03.045
The first vampire created
by the Catholic Church...

39:03.045 --> 39:06.253
- By accident.
- Shut the fuck up!

39:06.253 --> 39:09.670
This was your fight, cardinal.
Now it is mine.

39:09.670 --> 39:11.753
Jack!

39:11.753 --> 39:12.920
Jack!

39:15.503 --> 39:20.420
If you refuse to obey the rules,
the operation will be canceled...

39:20.420 --> 39:22.878
the funding withdrawn.

39:24.670 --> 39:29.545
You have any idea how this...
Valek... knows my name?

39:41.378 --> 39:43.212
Stay close to him.

40:50.003 --> 40:52.003
What's your name?

40:54.378 --> 40:57.212
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

40:58.628 --> 41:00.962
Help me!

41:01.212 --> 41:04.003
Hey!
Don't fuck with me, honey!

41:04.003 --> 41:07.420
I'll snap your neck like a twig!

41:08.253 --> 41:10.920
Now nod your head yes or no.

41:10.920 --> 41:14.295
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

41:14.378 --> 41:16.170
Do it!

41:17.795 --> 41:19.503
All right.

41:19.503 --> 41:22.212
Now I'm going to explain it to you.

41:23.045 --> 41:26.378
First, I'm gonna take
my hand off your mouth.

41:26.378 --> 41:28.670
If you scream...

41:31.920 --> 41:33.670
Good.

41:37.670 --> 41:39.462
Now.

41:39.462 --> 41:41.712
What's your name?

41:42.795 --> 41:45.003
Katrina.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.087
Okay, Katrina.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.420
Here's the score.

41:56.170 --> 41:59.003
I took off your clothes.
I cleaned you up.

41:59.003 --> 42:02.253
I tied you down.
I also saved your ass.

42:02.253 --> 42:07.128
You've been bitten by a vampire.
Remember the party at the motel?

42:07.212 --> 42:11.045
Big guy, pointy teeth.
Really shitty breath.

42:11.087 --> 42:12.753
Don't worry.

42:12.753 --> 42:14.670
It'll come back to you.

42:15.420 --> 42:19.420
A master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims.

42:19.420 --> 42:21.878
You're gonna help us find him.

42:21.878 --> 42:24.420
While he's sleeping,
we unleash on him.

42:24.753 --> 42:27.128
You're the bait, honey.

42:27.628 --> 42:29.628
Sorry.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.712
I know all about you, Mr. Crow.

42:41.712 --> 42:44.587
I know your parents were
bitten by vampires.

42:44.587 --> 42:48.170
You were raised by the Church
as it's master slayer.

42:49.753 --> 42:52.962
You know the truth is, I didn't
wanna be forced on you like this.

42:52.962 --> 42:56.253
I was supposed to take over
when Father Giovanni retired.

42:56.253 --> 42:58.170
I always dreamed of this.

42:58.170 --> 43:01.712
Ever since I first heard about
you, heard about the slayers.

43:01.878 --> 43:05.337
I want to be part of the team,
You know, just do whatever I could.

43:05.337 --> 43:07.670
For example, if you
wanted to receive...

43:07.670 --> 43:09.628
the sacrament of confession...

43:09.628 --> 43:11.253
Fucking priest!

43:23.587 --> 43:24.670
Who set us up?

43:24.670 --> 43:26.420
Was it you? Who set us up?

43:26.420 --> 43:27.962
Who was it,

43:27.962 --> 43:29.045
Huh?

43:29.045 --> 43:30.337
Who set us up?

43:30.337 --> 43:33.128
I don't know
what you're taking about!

43:33.128 --> 43:36.045
You don't think I'll kill you,
because you're a priest.

43:36.045 --> 43:38.462
You're seriously misjudging
the wrong mother-fucker!

43:38.462 --> 43:40.712
You wanna kill me,
you go ahead, okay?

43:40.712 --> 43:44.003
I don't know what you're
talking about!

43:44.420 --> 43:46.295
I don't.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.962
We'll see about that.

43:59.170 --> 44:00.503
Where're we going?

44:02.712 --> 44:05.253
You have to tell me
what's going on, Mr. Crow.

44:06.795 --> 44:09.337
- Have you ever seen a vampire?
- No.

44:09.337 --> 44:11.920
Now, first of all,
they're not romantic, alright?

44:11.920 --> 44:15.212
They're not a bunch of fags,
hopping around in rented formalwear...

44:15.212 --> 44:18.337
and seducing everybody insight,
with a Euro-trash accents, alright?

44:18.337 --> 44:20.587
Forget whatever you've seen
in the movies.

44:20.587 --> 44:23.378
They don't turn into bats.
Crosses don't work.

44:23.378 --> 44:25.545
Garlic? Stand there
with garlic around your neck,

44:25.545 --> 44:27.920
one of them fuckers
will bend you fucking over...

44:27.920 --> 44:28.962
and takes a walk up your...

44:28.962 --> 44:31.462
strata chocolata while he's
sucking the blood outta you!

44:31.462 --> 44:35.128
All right? They don't sleep
in coffins lined with taffeta.

44:35.128 --> 44:36.253
You wanna kill one?

44:36.253 --> 44:39.545
You drive a wooden stake,
right through his fucking heart.

44:40.045 --> 44:43.170
Sunlight turns them
into crispy critters.

44:43.462 --> 44:46.920
Got it?
See this map?

44:47.337 --> 44:49.253
This map shows
all the encounters...

44:49.253 --> 44:52.670
in the United States,
as far back as the 1800's.

44:52.670 --> 44:54.753
- I've never seen it.
- No one has~

44:54.753 --> 44:56.128
Look at the Southwest.

44:56.128 --> 44:57.753
- See the spiral pattern?
- Yes.

44:57.753 --> 44:59.712
It's a Time-sequence
with all encounters,

44:59.712 --> 45:03.045
you get a logarithmic pattern,
ever-widening.

45:03.170 --> 45:07.420
It's a search pattern, Padre.
They're looking for something.

45:07.628 --> 45:09.128
Do you know what it is?

45:09.128 --> 45:12.545
I heard stories...
when I was young.

45:12.712 --> 45:15.128
Something about a black cross.

45:15.128 --> 45:18.128
About vampires walking
in the sunlight.

45:18.962 --> 45:20.545
Padre.

45:21.128 --> 45:23.337
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

45:23.337 --> 45:25.920
When I was kicking your ass
back there...

45:26.087 --> 45:28.837
- did that give you wood?
- What?

45:29.712 --> 45:33.170
Huh? You get a little mahogany~
from that ebony?

45:34.587 --> 45:37.837
I'm just fucking with you, Padre.
Forget about it.

45:40.420 --> 45:43.087
And what God has given her...

45:43.087 --> 45:47.587
is that she then sees
her guardian angel.

46:24.128 --> 46:26.503
Oh, Jesus!

46:39.795 --> 46:41.337
What time is it?

46:45.128 --> 46:46.670
9:10.

46:56.503 --> 46:59.212
- You want one?
- Uh'uh.

46:59.212 --> 47:01.503
You gotta eat something.

47:01.503 --> 47:03.712
I can't.

47:05.878 --> 47:08.337
I wouldn't mind
a cigarette, tough.

47:15.003 --> 47:16.378
We have to work on this.

47:16.378 --> 47:19.003
The less you eat, the faster the
virus moves through your system.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.587
Virus?

47:20.962 --> 47:24.670
Yeah, that's what I call it.
Nobody knows what it really is.

47:24.670 --> 47:27.670
Poison, Kool-Aid, whatever,
it all does the same thing.

47:27.670 --> 47:30.045
Turns you into a vampire.

47:39.212 --> 47:41.962
What happened to
the other girls at the party?

47:42.753 --> 47:44.545
They didn't make it.

47:44.753 --> 47:46.628
I'm sorry.

47:47.753 --> 47:50.253
So, you remember now?

47:51.087 --> 47:53.170
Yeah, some.

47:53.962 --> 47:57.128
- Why doesn't anyone know?
- Nobody wants to know.

47:57.128 --> 47:59.962
That's how vampires survive.
They're smart.

47:59.962 --> 48:01.962
They keep their numbers low,
live in small bands...

48:01.962 --> 48:04.837
and the real world
never catches on.

48:05.628 --> 48:07.378
Will I end up
being one?

48:08.587 --> 48:11.295
I don't know for sure.

48:11.962 --> 48:13.670
- Probably.
- Ugh...

48:13.795 --> 48:18.587
Un... unless we find him
before you turn, then...

48:18.670 --> 48:21.003
maybe there's a chance.

48:21.212 --> 48:22.795
Look...

48:23.878 --> 48:25.670
here's what we do know.

48:25.670 --> 48:28.420
You're connected
to the master vampire, now.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.878
He's a part of you.

48:31.003 --> 48:33.087
And this link will grow.

48:33.670 --> 48:36.545
You'll never be able
to get him outta you.

48:36.670 --> 48:39.420
Not while he still exists.

48:39.503 --> 48:41.920
Then I don't wanna live.

48:43.503 --> 48:45.087
You may not.

49:04.087 --> 49:06.003
Can I get dressed now?

49:07.087 --> 49:08.503
Sure.

49:09.545 --> 49:12.545
Could you get me a towel
or something, maybe?

49:12.962 --> 49:15.337
It's not like I haven't
seen you naked.

49:15.337 --> 49:16.795
- Fuck it!
- Alright...

49:16.795 --> 49:18.962
easy, easy.
I'll get you a towel.

49:18.962 --> 49:22.753
One towel coming right up.
I won't peek.

49:33.670 --> 49:37.170
Nice try.
Leave the door open.

49:37.170 --> 49:39.087
No way.

49:39.087 --> 49:41.295
A little bit.

50:23.878 --> 50:25.545
Oh, no...

51:10.878 --> 51:14.087
- Don't do it! Damn it.
- Let me go!

51:14.420 --> 51:16.170
Let me go!

51:17.920 --> 51:19.253
Shit!

51:20.462 --> 51:22.795
Stop it!

51:24.795 --> 51:26.420
Look what you did!

51:31.503 --> 51:34.462
- You fucking bit me!
- Ahh... ahh...

51:34.503 --> 51:36.378
What're you, fucking nuts?

51:37.837 --> 51:40.128
Where're you going?

51:40.128 --> 51:42.712
You bite me, huh?
Get up!

51:42.712 --> 51:45.503
Fucking bite me!

51:47.753 --> 51:50.087
Fucking bitch!

51:52.545 --> 51:54.087
Fuck!

51:58.253 --> 52:00.295
Goddamn it!

52:18.378 --> 52:21.087
Fucking stupid whore.

52:24.545 --> 52:26.378
On my way.

52:30.587 --> 52:32.503
Yeah?

52:32.503 --> 52:34.420
Where are you?

52:34.420 --> 52:36.503
What?

52:36.795 --> 52:38.587
I'm fine.

52:38.712 --> 52:40.170
Yeah, I'm fine.

52:40.170 --> 52:41.378
Room 312.

52:41.378 --> 52:43.087
Stay there,
I'm coming up.

52:43.087 --> 52:45.045
Stay put.

52:51.712 --> 52:54.795
I'm Father Adam Guiteau.
You're Tony Montoya?

52:54.795 --> 52:56.587
You look different.

52:56.587 --> 53:00.253
I'm an archivist. I've studied
the team extensively.

53:09.170 --> 53:12.045
Montoya, what's this bruise
on her jaw?

53:13.378 --> 53:15.128
I had to hit her.

53:15.753 --> 53:16.795
She tried to kill herself.

53:16.795 --> 53:19.878
I had to pull her off
the edge of the fire escape.

53:19.878 --> 53:21.045
Then, uh...

53:21.045 --> 53:23.378
I fell through the window.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.337
That's all?

53:36.170 --> 53:37.753
So, why'd you slug her?

53:37.753 --> 53:40.212
I cut my arm
on the broken glass.

53:40.212 --> 53:42.462
I was pissed.
I don't know.

53:42.462 --> 53:45.253
I fucking slugged her.
Who cares?

53:49.628 --> 53:51.087
That's our new Padre.

53:51.087 --> 53:54.795
We've been ordered back to Monterey.
Rebuild the team, start over.

53:54.795 --> 53:57.212
- We're going back to Monterey?
- No.

53:57.212 --> 54:00.045
Callahan's whole team is gone.

54:00.128 --> 54:01.503
Slaughtered.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.670
So it's just us now.

54:03.670 --> 54:05.212
That's right.

54:05.628 --> 54:07.170
Who is she?

54:07.378 --> 54:09.337
Some hooker.

54:09.337 --> 54:13.128
Bitten by Valek. These vampires are
psychically linked to each other.

54:13.128 --> 54:15.670
As soon she hooks into Valek...

54:16.003 --> 54:17.920
we go looking for him.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.837
We have orders to follow,
Mr. Crow.

54:19.837 --> 54:21.170
Yeah, fuck you, Padre.

54:21.170 --> 54:22.545
Language!

54:22.545 --> 54:23.837
Mr. Crow, if you not
gonna follow orders,

54:23.837 --> 54:26.378
I'll have to call
Cardinal Alba.

54:30.962 --> 54:32.837
Excuse me.

54:32.837 --> 54:34.712
Language.

54:37.878 --> 54:40.545
We'll chat about language.
Shall we?

54:40.670 --> 54:42.503
See if this syntax works here.

54:42.503 --> 54:45.587
You don't make a call,
you don't blow your nose...

54:45.587 --> 54:49.337
you don't wipe your ass,
unless I tell you. Okay?

55:11.587 --> 55:13.837
Show me.

55:22.837 --> 55:25.503
- She's up.
- Good.

55:26.087 --> 55:27.587
Katrina?

55:27.587 --> 55:29.128
Can you hear me?

55:31.378 --> 55:32.712
What is that?

55:32.920 --> 55:34.253
There's someone else in here...

55:34.253 --> 55:37.587
someone you're connected to in
your mind, you know who I'm about?

55:38.378 --> 55:40.295
Katrina, what're you seeing?

55:42.920 --> 55:44.295
I can't.

55:44.295 --> 55:47.795
Yes, you can, honey, you're
with us now and your safe.

55:47.795 --> 55:50.670
Now, where is he?
What're you seeing?

55:51.003 --> 55:52.670
It's dark.

55:52.670 --> 55:54.462
All right.
Keep trying.

55:57.420 --> 55:58.962
There's a map.

55:59.420 --> 56:01.962
A circle on the map.

56:06.670 --> 56:08.087
We need a location, Montoya.
Come on!

56:08.087 --> 56:10.628
- I'm fucking working on it, Jack!
- Before she loses him, Come on!

56:10.628 --> 56:13.795
- You wanna switch places?
- Just come on!

56:14.253 --> 56:16.837
Katrina,
listen very carefully now.

56:16.837 --> 56:19.670
I need to know exactly
where you are.

56:19.670 --> 56:23.420
What you're seeing right now.
Details.

56:27.503 --> 56:29.045
No!

56:31.420 --> 56:34.628
- Oh!... He killed a priest!
- What?

56:34.628 --> 56:36.587
- You're safe!
- Priest?

56:36.587 --> 56:38.962
Did she say a priest?
What priest?

56:40.545 --> 56:42.253
He's moving now.

56:42.253 --> 56:43.962
Come on.
Stay with him.

56:43.962 --> 56:45.962
There's a sign...

56:45.962 --> 56:49.295
on a highway...
that says San Miguel.

56:49.295 --> 56:51.545
San Miguel? San Miguel?
Come on, hey, hey...

56:51.545 --> 56:53.003
come on, keep trying!
You have to!

56:53.003 --> 56:54.753
I can't!

56:54.753 --> 56:57.337
- Goddamn it!
- Jack, the link's broken.

56:57.337 --> 56:59.420
What priest is she
talking about? Goddamn it!

56:59.420 --> 57:01.462
I can get a list of all
churches in San Miguel County...

57:01.462 --> 57:03.753
if you'll let me use the phone
and call the archdiocese to...

57:03.753 --> 57:07.295
Get it, call every church.
Find one where a Padre's missing.

57:07.295 --> 57:10.045
Road trip, Montoya.
Your job is to watch this girl.

57:10.045 --> 57:11.545
Goddamn it!

57:13.087 --> 57:15.712
Hey, what's wrong with you?

57:17.045 --> 57:20.045
I'm just tired, that's all.

57:27.837 --> 57:30.587
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

57:33.378 --> 57:36.295
Nothing...
you'd wanna listen to, man.

57:46.253 --> 57:48.753
Yeah, I got a fax this morning from
the cardinals office in Santa Fe.

57:48.753 --> 57:50.837
You're an investigator working
for the Catholic Church?

57:50.837 --> 57:52.587
That's right.
We're looking into a...

57:52.587 --> 57:55.628
possible Nation-wide pattern
of anti-Catholic hate crimes.

57:55.878 --> 57:58.712
- May I?
- It's pretty damn savage.

58:07.712 --> 58:09.795
What about the old priest,
is any of this blood his?

58:09.795 --> 58:12.837
His name is Father Molina.

58:13.170 --> 58:14.920
Sorry.

58:15.045 --> 58:16.087
Listen...

58:16.087 --> 58:18.545
you get something on this case,
you gonna share it with me, right?

58:18.545 --> 58:21.795
- That's right.
- I better not find out different.

58:21.795 --> 58:23.253
You won't.

58:23.253 --> 58:26.212
So far, it looks like all
this blood's from Mrs. Fisher.

58:26.212 --> 58:29.295
We won't know that for sure till
we get a sample from pathology.

58:29.295 --> 58:31.378
Was anything stolen?

58:31.378 --> 58:34.087
- Just Father Molina.
- We found him!

58:39.212 --> 58:40.587
Lord!

58:54.962 --> 58:56.503
I don't get this!

58:56.503 --> 58:58.420
Why come all this way to
San Miguel to attack some...

58:58.420 --> 59:01.170
old... small town priest
and a cleaning lady?

59:01.170 --> 59:03.837
Doesn't make sense, Valek,
didn't feed on either of them.

59:03.837 --> 59:05.378
Father Molina was a
well known scholar...

59:05.378 --> 59:07.253
of early Catholic history
in the United States...

59:07.253 --> 59:09.962
- Who gives a shit, what's the point?
- I don't know what the point is.

59:09.962 --> 59:12.837
I don't know why
Valek killed him.

59:12.962 --> 59:14.170
What's this symbol?

59:14.170 --> 59:15.962
The Cardinal told me
the Church doesn't know.

59:16.337 --> 59:19.712
You and the cardinal
are lying sacks of shit!

59:19.712 --> 59:22.962
Come on, Padre. Help me.
The hour's getting late!

59:25.753 --> 59:28.337
It's a medieval
astronomical sign...

59:29.045 --> 59:31.170
for the sun.

01:00:38.378 --> 01:00:41.670
There are seven more
with him now.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:45.087
Powerful.

01:00:45.087 --> 01:00:47.378
Are they masters?

01:00:47.587 --> 01:00:49.128
Yes.

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:41.753
Padre...

01:01:46.795 --> 01:01:49.878
I'm beginning to like you.
So don't make me hurt you, okay?

01:01:49.878 --> 01:01:51.253
Just tell me what you know.

01:01:51.253 --> 01:01:53.420
I'll buy you a beer
and get you laid, come on.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:56.795
If you don't tell me everything,
I'll just start cutting on you.

01:01:58.878 --> 01:02:02.795
No, you won't...
You're a righteous man, Mr. Crow.

01:02:03.628 --> 01:02:06.378
Besides, I serve
a higher master, then you.

01:02:06.378 --> 01:02:07.878
With any secrets
that I keep...

01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:10.712
I kept to protect the Church
and its followers, is part of...

01:02:10.712 --> 01:02:11.962
that...

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:14.003
- Open your mouth.
- What?

01:02:14.003 --> 01:02:16.170
Open your mouth.

01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:24.962
Give me your hand.

01:02:31.962 --> 01:02:35.337
You better listen to me,
you fuck!

01:02:36.337 --> 01:02:38.628
My father kept a secret once.

01:02:38.628 --> 01:02:41.587
He'd been bitten by a vampire.

01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:44.712
He kept it a secret...
from me and my mother.

01:02:44.712 --> 01:02:47.378
By the fifth day,
he was turning.

01:02:47.378 --> 01:02:50.337
That night,
he attacked my mother.

01:02:50.337 --> 01:02:53.045
And then he came after me.

01:02:53.045 --> 01:02:56.462
I killed my own father, Padre.

01:02:56.462 --> 01:02:59.087
I got no trouble killing you.

01:03:00.545 --> 01:03:02.628
Last chance.

01:03:04.295 --> 01:03:05.753
Now open your
mother-fucking mouth.

01:03:05.753 --> 01:03:08.462
Open your fucking mouth!

01:03:08.462 --> 01:03:09.837
Then prepare to...

01:03:09.837 --> 01:03:11.795
What? You ready?
Excuse me?

01:03:11.795 --> 01:03:16.337
Valek is looking for an ancient
relic, 'The Cross of Berziers'.

01:03:23.378 --> 01:03:24.878
After his trial,
the Church declared that...

01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:26.712
Valek was possessed by Demons.

01:03:26.712 --> 01:03:28.003
He was taken
to a small town...

01:03:28.003 --> 01:03:30.295
in the south of France
called Berziers.

01:03:30.337 --> 01:03:33.878
An exorcism was performed
using an ancient...

01:03:33.878 --> 01:03:37.212
forbidden form
of a ceremony.

01:03:37.295 --> 01:03:40.545
It was long and very brutal.

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:43.212
Something went wrong.

01:03:53.587 --> 01:03:55.837
The wooden gate is opening.

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:05.587
The accounts are confused, but
they refer to an inverse exorcism.

01:04:05.753 --> 01:04:09.628
The body is destroyed, but
the possessed soul remains.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:12.337
The exorcism transformed
Valek into a creature...

01:04:12.337 --> 01:04:14.837
whose body is dead...
but lives on.

01:04:14.837 --> 01:04:16.170
A vampire.

01:04:16.212 --> 01:04:17.920
A vampire.

01:05:05.878 --> 01:05:07.753
It's a cross.

01:05:21.253 --> 01:05:24.462
The stories you heard about
the Black Cross are true.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:27.420
It was used in Valek's exorcism
and taken back to Rome.

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.003
It's known as the Berziers Cross.

01:05:31.378 --> 01:05:33.587
The cross was then
shipped to the New World.

01:05:33.587 --> 01:05:36.837
It was moved ever since from
one Spanish mission to another.

01:05:36.837 --> 01:05:40.003
It's exact location was kept
secret, even from the Vatican.

01:05:40.003 --> 01:05:43.920
For hundreds of years it was lost.
Cardinal Alba discovered the name...

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.628
of the only living priest who
knew the location of the cross.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:50.587
Father Joseph Molina.

01:05:50.962 --> 01:05:54.670
Cardinal Alba and I came to the
United States to find Father Molina.

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:58.295
To reclaim the Berziers Cross.
And that is all I know.

01:06:09.503 --> 01:06:11.712
You're a good man, Padre.

01:06:11.712 --> 01:06:13.878
Welcome to the team.

01:06:18.212 --> 01:06:20.545
God forgive me.

01:06:30.795 --> 01:06:32.712
He found it.

01:06:35.712 --> 01:06:37.420
Let's hit it.

01:06:42.837 --> 01:06:45.253
Wait!...
Wait, stop the car!

01:06:51.753 --> 01:06:53.087
That way.

01:07:33.545 --> 01:07:35.170
Hey.

01:08:02.295 --> 01:08:03.837
It was here.

01:08:22.087 --> 01:08:24.295
You picking up anything?

01:08:24.627 --> 01:08:25.962
He's gone.

01:08:26.752 --> 01:08:29.252
- You don't look so good.
- She hasn't turned yet, Jack.

01:08:29.252 --> 01:08:30.670
- Ahh...
- She can't eat.

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:33.170
Maybe what she really wants is
human blood, what'd you think?

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.170
- I said she hasn't turned...
- I heard what you said.

01:08:40.502 --> 01:08:41.877
Hey.

01:08:41.877 --> 01:08:44.170
Why don't you back off?

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:45.127
What's with you?

01:08:45.127 --> 01:08:47.337
What'd you mean, what's with me?
What's with you?

01:08:47.337 --> 01:08:49.087
You're being such
a fucking asshole.

01:08:49.087 --> 01:08:51.795
What the fuck
is your problem?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.712
You're not going to fall
for this half-dead cunt...

01:08:54.712 --> 01:08:56.587
Fuck!

01:08:59.087 --> 01:09:00.502
Nice shot.
Wanna try again?

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:03.462
- Stop it!
- Get the fuck outta here!

01:09:03.462 --> 01:09:04.545
What're you doing?

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.545
We're about to have
one fuck of a fight!

01:09:06.587 --> 01:09:07.837
No.

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:11.337
Do you know why Valek
wants the Berziers cross?

01:09:11.337 --> 01:09:13.295
Think about it for a minute!

01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:16.420
I think Valek wants to finish
his transformation.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.002
The exorcism
was never completed.

01:09:18.002 --> 01:09:21.337
Valek was left vulnerable,
able to survive only at night.

01:09:21.337 --> 01:09:24.045
So, he...
completes the ritual?

01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:27.837
I think... I think
the balance shifts.

01:09:28.377 --> 01:09:33.045
For 600 years, Valek has tried to
find a way to live in the daylight.

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.295
Fuck me.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:37.127
Now with the Berziers Cross,
he will.

01:09:37.127 --> 01:09:41.670
A master vampire capable to
walk in the sun. Unstoppable.

01:09:41.670 --> 01:09:44.295
Unless we stop him.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.295
I guess we'll have to finish
this some other time.

01:09:49.295 --> 01:09:54.295
We got eight hours of sun left.
Come on. Come on.

01:09:57.712 --> 01:09:59.712
Come on, baby.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:07.128
That's where he is.

01:10:07.628 --> 01:10:09.920
Santiago.

01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:37.420
The place looks empty.

01:10:42.378 --> 01:10:44.295
He's near.

01:12:15.337 --> 01:12:17.003
Hello?

01:12:20.128 --> 01:12:23.045
What'd you figure the population
of this shit-joint is? 20?

01:12:23.045 --> 01:12:24.670
I'd say 30, maybe more.

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:27.378
Now, the question is,
how many of them are goons?

01:12:27.378 --> 01:12:30.003
Our worst-case scenario, half.

01:12:30.003 --> 01:12:31.587
15 dead, 15 goons.

01:12:31.587 --> 01:12:34.420
We took the whole time Valek's
been here what, several days?

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:36.128
That's right, Padre.

01:12:36.128 --> 01:12:39.337
He set this up. Slowly.
One goon at a time.

01:12:39.337 --> 01:12:41.253
Now he's got the cross
and the biggest nest...

01:12:41.253 --> 01:12:43.462
the fucking
the world's ever known.

01:12:43.462 --> 01:12:45.670
What'd we got? Three slayers.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.628
Two slayers.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.712
Time to kill some vampires.

01:12:52.712 --> 01:12:54.920
You with us, Padre?

01:12:56.712 --> 01:12:58.878
Yeah, I'm with you.

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:01.378
The location.

01:13:09.670 --> 01:13:12.003
Where is he?

01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:23.128
Everywhere.

01:13:24.878 --> 01:13:27.212
Katrina, baby, listen.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:29.462
Is he in there?

01:13:29.462 --> 01:13:31.337
Yeah.

01:13:31.962 --> 01:13:34.295
He's in there.

01:13:34.628 --> 01:13:37.003
In the dark.

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.295
Great. Good girl.

01:13:41.587 --> 01:13:44.670
And the best constructed
building in town is?

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:46.045
The jail, of course.

01:13:46.045 --> 01:13:47.420
Bingo.

01:13:47.420 --> 01:13:48.920
She senses him in there.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.087
- You think she's telling the truth?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.087 --> 01:13:53.503
Suppose he's taking control
of her? Let's hope he hasn't.

01:13:53.503 --> 01:13:55.962
Then I guess I'll pay
with my life on that.

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:58.628
You're not the only one, amigo.

01:13:58.628 --> 01:14:00.962
You're not the only one.

01:14:31.212 --> 01:14:32.628
Can you hear me?

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:40.378
I'm sorry.

01:14:40.878 --> 01:14:42.545
It'll be all right.

01:14:43.212 --> 01:14:45.420
I'll take care of you.

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:52.628
I promise.

01:16:11.545 --> 01:16:13.170
It's thirsty.

01:16:13.337 --> 01:16:15.587
Think she smells your blood.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.753
I got it! I got it!

01:16:23.837 --> 01:16:25.837
Take the woman, Montoya!

01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:36.462
Cocksucker! Come on!
Come on!

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:40.753
Help!

01:16:42.503 --> 01:16:43.878
Padre, kill it!

01:16:43.878 --> 01:16:45.462
Kill it, damn it!

01:16:46.962 --> 01:16:49.920
Don't just sit there, kill it!

01:16:54.462 --> 01:16:55.920
With the stake!

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:59.087
Kill him with the stake!
Through the heart!

01:17:07.587 --> 01:17:10.545
How do you like
your stake, bitch?!

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:54.920
I wonder if there's
another way to the cells?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.003
- I hope not, it doesn't look that way.
- We have to get them...

01:17:57.003 --> 01:17:59.503
inside the elevator and make
them come out through the door.

01:17:59.503 --> 01:18:01.128
- That means using the cable.
- That's right.

01:18:01.128 --> 01:18:03.128
Forget the winch, we'll attach
the cable right to the Jeep.

01:18:03.128 --> 01:18:05.087
Do it fast and yank 'em
right out into the sun.

01:18:05.087 --> 01:18:07.295
- Someone has to drive the Jeep.
- That's right.

01:18:07.295 --> 01:18:09.087
How you expect to lure 'em
in the elevator?

01:18:09.087 --> 01:18:11.087
Somebody's gotta be inside.

01:18:11.503 --> 01:18:13.670
Escape hatch, huh?

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:17.795
When they get inside the elevator,
one of us goes through the hole.

01:18:17.795 --> 01:18:20.253
The other guy up there presses
the button to secure control.

01:18:20.253 --> 01:18:22.628
The door is shut.
They get trapped inside.

01:18:22.628 --> 01:18:24.837
- But it has to be me.
- What?

01:18:24.837 --> 01:18:28.337
You have to be up there
to fire the crossbow.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:29.378
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:29.378 --> 01:18:30.962
You wanna drive,
I'll do it.

01:18:30.962 --> 01:18:33.462
I can't drive.
I never learned it.

01:18:34.087 --> 01:18:35.670
Okay, Padre.

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:39.295
Light her up and shave your ass.
You're the bait.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.045
Katrina.

01:18:52.045 --> 01:18:54.503
Katrina, listen to me!

01:18:55.128 --> 01:18:58.670
You've gotta try
to hold on. Okay?

01:19:02.212 --> 01:19:04.003
- You seen Valek?
- Not yet.

01:19:04.003 --> 01:19:05.962
Anything?

01:19:06.753 --> 01:19:08.087
There.

01:19:11.003 --> 01:19:12.378
And there.

01:19:16.045 --> 01:19:18.045
Okay, I'm ready.

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:21.128
- You gotta be fleet of foot, padre.
- I know.

01:19:21.128 --> 01:19:23.420
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:25.337
I used to play soccer.

01:19:25.337 --> 01:19:28.462
- Soccer?
- I was captain of my team.

01:19:28.462 --> 01:19:31.587
- I'd better be the one in-
- No, I'll be fine.

01:19:31.587 --> 01:19:33.420
- You will?
- Don't worry about me, Mr. Crow.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.628
- Just shoot when the door opens.
- You can count on that.

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:43.253
- Padre...
- I know.

01:19:48.462 --> 01:19:51.712
- Montoya, he's on his way.
- Hooked and ready, Jack.

01:20:43.337 --> 01:20:45.128
What're you doing?

01:20:51.378 --> 01:20:53.753
Get back
in the fucking elevator!

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:06.503
Shit!

01:21:09.378 --> 01:21:12.712
Get ready, Montoya.
Here we go.

01:21:45.253 --> 01:21:47.628
- Jack...
- Padre?

01:22:07.128 --> 01:22:08.462
Open!

01:22:14.628 --> 01:22:16.253
Montoya, now!

01:22:16.253 --> 01:22:18.753
Sayonara, motherfucker!

01:22:18.753 --> 01:22:20.087
Pull!

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:44.795
- Padre, you okay?
- Yes.

01:22:44.795 --> 01:22:46.378
- Did he bite you or scratch you?
- No.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:48.253
Okay, come on.

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.545
No! Keep that door...
Shit!

01:22:53.545 --> 01:22:55.545
- Sorry.
- Come on.

01:22:58.045 --> 01:23:00.337
It's going all the way down.

01:23:00.837 --> 01:23:03.212
Okay, I'm bringing it up.

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:06.128
- Sorry about the doors.
- No harm, no foul, padre.

01:23:08.587 --> 01:23:10.962
- You did good.
- I have to do it again.

01:23:10.962 --> 01:23:12.462
We're out of time!

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.837
Why aren't the doors open?
What's wrong?

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.003
Jack! You should
look at this!

01:23:52.670 --> 01:23:53.962
Shit!

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:56.087
Goddamn it!

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.503
Montoya!

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:03.170
Go! Go!

01:24:11.337 --> 01:24:14.003
Montoya, go! Go!

01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:27.337
- Come on!
- Go!

01:24:31.128 --> 01:24:32.878
Shit!

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:39.420
- You never said they could do that.
- I didn't know.

01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:41.170
Get outta the way!

01:24:46.378 --> 01:24:49.337
Let's do it,
you bloodsucking bitch!

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.295
Montoya! Hook it up!

01:24:53.295 --> 01:24:54.962
Padre, get a spike!

01:24:57.503 --> 01:24:59.420
She can't take you with her!

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:02.087
Here comes the sun! Come on!

01:25:07.295 --> 01:25:08.837
Jack!

01:25:09.337 --> 01:25:11.128
Die!

01:25:13.503 --> 01:25:16.253
Die, you fucker, die!

01:25:18.170 --> 01:25:20.503
Die, you miserable...

01:25:36.878 --> 01:25:38.962
Look at the sun!

01:25:40.045 --> 01:25:41.670
We're finished.

01:25:41.837 --> 01:25:43.628
No, we gotta go back.

01:25:43.628 --> 01:25:45.795
Rule number 10, Jack:

01:25:46.253 --> 01:25:48.753
You can't kill a master at night.

01:25:49.545 --> 01:25:51.462
It's over.

01:25:53.462 --> 01:25:55.128
He's right, Padre.

01:25:55.128 --> 01:25:57.087
Let's go.

01:26:20.753 --> 01:26:22.545
Hello, Jack.

01:26:37.712 --> 01:26:39.837
Motherfucker!

01:27:03.712 --> 01:27:06.712
Your war's over, crusader.

01:28:47.212 --> 01:28:49.587
Hello, Jack.

01:28:53.253 --> 01:28:55.170
From your expression...

01:28:55.170 --> 01:28:58.587
I assume you couldn't possibly
understand my presence here.

01:28:58.587 --> 01:29:02.712
I'm sorry...
to disillusion you Jack.

01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:05.003
As one grows old...

01:29:05.003 --> 01:29:07.837
as death approaches...

01:29:07.837 --> 01:29:10.295
we begin to question...

01:29:10.295 --> 01:29:12.212
our faith.

01:29:12.212 --> 01:29:14.462
And I found mine lacking.

01:29:14.462 --> 01:29:17.753
Is there a God?
Is there a Heaven?

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:20.295
I can no longer answer this
for certain.

01:29:20.295 --> 01:29:23.920
I've witnessed no miracles,
had no visions.

01:29:25.003 --> 01:29:29.128
And the prospect of death
terrifies me.

01:29:29.128 --> 01:29:33.712
I realized I've only one...
alternative.

01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:37.920
And I made a bargain
with the devil, if you wish.

01:29:38.087 --> 01:29:40.170
You are truly...

01:29:40.837 --> 01:29:42.753
a pile of dogshit, cardinal.

01:29:42.753 --> 01:29:46.045
Yeah. That's right.

01:29:46.253 --> 01:29:50.462
That's correct, Jack.
And I can live with that.

01:29:50.462 --> 01:29:53.295
After I've given Valek
what he wants...

01:29:53.295 --> 01:29:55.462
he'll fulfill our bargain.

01:29:55.545 --> 01:29:59.170
And I will be transformed
into one of his...

01:29:59.212 --> 01:30:01.670
new children.

01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:04.212
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:30:04.753 --> 01:30:07.295
Eternal life.

01:30:08.045 --> 01:30:10.545
Immortality...

01:30:10.587 --> 01:30:13.087
can change your heart.

01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:15.712
Valek...

01:30:16.253 --> 01:30:19.670
why don't you prove that you can
kick my ass. Come on. Untie me.

01:30:19.670 --> 01:30:20.962
Now, come on.

01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:22.712
You fucking
pole-smoking, fashion victim.

01:30:22.712 --> 01:30:24.795
Come on over here.

01:30:24.795 --> 01:30:26.462
- Jack.
- Come on, 5 minutes...

01:30:26.462 --> 01:30:30.087
then you can bite my ass, wouldn't you
like that? See me all tied up, huh?

01:30:30.087 --> 01:30:31.795
What will silence you?

01:30:31.795 --> 01:30:34.795
Come on. Untie me, you prick!

01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:38.962
Perhaps this will help.

01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:48.962
Apparently, your friend
is one of my children now.

01:30:50.837 --> 01:30:53.712
You are alone, crusader.

01:31:55.962 --> 01:31:58.170
What'd you want
from me, Valek?

01:32:05.337 --> 01:32:07.420
You hate me so, don't you?

01:32:08.045 --> 01:32:10.462
But you made me, crusader.

01:32:10.462 --> 01:32:13.128
You hate what you've made.
You fear it.

01:32:13.128 --> 01:32:15.628
Because it is superior to you.

01:32:16.253 --> 01:32:19.920
For 600 years,
I fed on your kind at will.

01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:33.545
Why don't you just kill me
and get it over with?

01:32:33.545 --> 01:32:35.628
Because you're needed, Jack.

01:32:36.045 --> 01:32:40.378
The ceremony is a reenactment
of the original exorcism.

01:32:40.378 --> 01:32:43.045
It requires the blood
of a crusader...

01:32:43.045 --> 01:32:47.045
and his crucifixion
upon a burning cross.

01:32:47.045 --> 01:32:49.920
The climax of the ceremony
must coincide...

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.545
with the first rays
of the rising sun.

01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:56.462
Sorry, Jack.

01:33:46.170 --> 01:33:49.795
Oh, god!
Mother-fucker.

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.295
Padre!

01:34:29.962 --> 01:34:32.087
Now what're you
gonna do, Valek?

01:34:32.087 --> 01:34:34.295
You got nobody
to complete your ritual.

01:34:34.295 --> 01:34:36.670
The sun's starting to rise!

01:34:38.545 --> 01:34:41.795
You will finish the ritual.

01:34:42.878 --> 01:34:44.170
Try and make me!

01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:47.337
That-a-boy, Padre.
Fuck with him! Hey, Valek!

01:34:47.337 --> 01:34:48.962
You're shit-outta-luck.

01:34:48.962 --> 01:34:50.753
Give it up.

01:35:07.295 --> 01:35:08.920
Finish it.

01:35:08.962 --> 01:35:10.170
No.

01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:11.378
Finish it!

01:35:11.378 --> 01:35:12.920
No!

01:35:15.962 --> 01:35:18.962
Come on, Padre!
My nuts are on fire here!

01:35:55.795 --> 01:35:58.545
Come on.
Let's get some vampires.

01:37:11.878 --> 01:37:13.628
End of the line, Valek!

01:37:25.128 --> 01:37:28.087
You still with us, Crow?

01:37:30.337 --> 01:37:33.170
I don't burn so good, bloodsucker.

01:37:34.795 --> 01:37:36.712
Give me the cross.

01:37:36.712 --> 01:37:40.003
This cross?
Let me just ask you one thing.

01:37:40.003 --> 01:37:43.545
After 600 years, how's that
dick working? Pretty good?

01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:56.253
Suck this!

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:02.545
Die, you fucker! Die!

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:05.670
Jack.

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:23.337
You can't kill me.

01:38:43.962 --> 01:38:46.295
You ugly, bloodsucking fucker!

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:47.628
Die!

01:38:56.045 --> 01:38:57.920
Shit!

01:39:06.003 --> 01:39:07.503
Jesus!

01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:25.337
Listen to me.
It's going to be okay.

01:39:25.337 --> 01:39:28.670
I'll be right back. Okay?

01:39:39.545 --> 01:39:41.795
Put your head back.

01:40:12.295 --> 01:40:14.337
You look like shit, Montoya.

01:40:16.670 --> 01:40:18.753
Where you going?

01:40:20.337 --> 01:40:21.670
South.

01:40:22.503 --> 01:40:24.045
You love her that much?

01:40:26.628 --> 01:40:29.295
We make the perfect
couple, Jack.

01:40:29.295 --> 01:40:31.712
- You're not leaving!
- Padre...

01:40:31.753 --> 01:40:33.462
back off.

01:40:33.462 --> 01:40:34.795
No.

01:40:35.003 --> 01:40:36.587
Don't make me
come over there...

01:40:36.587 --> 01:40:38.712
and beat the shit
out of you, padre!

01:40:38.712 --> 01:40:41.378
- Back off!
- He's a vampire, Jack!

01:40:43.503 --> 01:40:44.837
Rule number one:

01:40:45.212 --> 01:40:48.545
If your partner is ever
bitten by a vampire...

01:40:49.003 --> 01:40:50.670
never...

01:40:50.670 --> 01:40:53.128
ever let him live.

01:40:55.253 --> 01:40:56.878
Padre...

01:41:01.462 --> 01:41:03.628
I'm not a slayer
anymore, Jack.

01:41:04.378 --> 01:41:06.295
Besides...

01:41:06.878 --> 01:41:08.753
the way I figure...

01:41:09.295 --> 01:41:12.837
you two got plenty to do
cleaning the rest of it now.

01:41:12.837 --> 01:41:15.128
Meanwhile she hides in back of
the van, hiding from sunlight...

01:41:15.128 --> 01:41:16.712
while you make it
for the border?

01:41:16.712 --> 01:41:18.920
Try to catch it
by nightfall, okay?

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.045
I need a vacation, Jack.

01:41:22.045 --> 01:41:24.003
When did she first bite you?

01:41:26.587 --> 01:41:28.962
Two days ago.

01:41:29.295 --> 01:41:31.545
I still covered your ass.

01:41:32.128 --> 01:41:34.378
Yes, you did.

01:41:39.253 --> 01:41:41.837
I would say I owe you
two days pay.

01:41:45.878 --> 01:41:47.212
What'd you say, padre?

01:41:47.462 --> 01:41:49.337
You've got two days.

01:42:00.837 --> 01:42:02.587
Wherever you go...

01:42:05.837 --> 01:42:08.045
I will find you.

01:42:08.045 --> 01:42:10.212
I will hunt you down...

01:42:11.378 --> 01:42:13.420
and I will kill you.

01:42:13.753 --> 01:42:15.837
The girl too.

01:42:26.045 --> 01:42:28.087
Vaya con Dios, my friend.

01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.628
Vaya con Dios, slayer.

01:42:57.712 --> 01:43:00.753
Time to slay
some vampires, Padre.

01:43:00.753 --> 01:43:02.253
You up for it?

01:43:02.253 --> 01:43:03.545
I guess so.

01:43:03.545 --> 01:43:06.878
- Just the two of us.
- No, Mr. Crow.

01:43:06.878 --> 01:43:09.378
He was always with us.

01:43:15.212 --> 01:43:17.503
Fair enough, Padre.

01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:20.837
Let me ask you a question.

01:43:21.462 --> 01:43:23.337
When you were stabbing
that vampire in there...

01:43:23.337 --> 01:43:24.962
- Yeah?
- did you know the wood?

01:43:24.962 --> 01:43:26.128
Mahogany.

01:43:26.128 --> 01:43:27.378
- Excuse me?
- Ebony.

01:43:27.378 --> 01:43:29.045
- What?
- Teak.

01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:31.170
Are you possessed by demons?

01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:34.795
- A major chubby.
- Language, Padre, language.
