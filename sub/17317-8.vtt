00:20.140 --> 00:22.580
Hello, hello! Hello, everybody!

00:23.300 --> 00:25.220
Hello and welcome...

00:25.220 --> 00:29.580
Hello and welcome to a sea
of disappointed faces,

00:29.580 --> 00:32.940
as these people have driven
all the way down here today,

00:32.940 --> 00:36.940
only to find that the show isn't
actually coming from here today.

00:36.940 --> 00:39.940
No, it is in fact coming
from 6,000 miles away,

00:39.940 --> 00:42.620
here, in Vietnam.

00:42.620 --> 00:45.260
Yes, we were told to meet
in the centre of Saigon,

00:45.260 --> 00:47.060
and await further instructions.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.500
So, sit back, enjoy the ride.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.480
'We arrived in Saigon and got
straight down to business.'

00:56.480 --> 00:58.560
No! Mel...

00:58.560 --> 01:00.640
That was Mel Gibson!

01:00.640 --> 01:02.360
Mel Gibson
is We Were Soldiers.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.319
You're thinking of Hamburger Hill...
Since we left...

01:05.319 --> 01:10.480
He sticks the knife... Yes, and
Private Pyle was Full Metal Jacket
which was shot in the Docklands.

01:10.480 --> 01:13.520
Will you stop going on about
what I imagine are war films?!

01:13.520 --> 01:15.320
Ah! Challenge! Hello. Thank you.

01:15.320 --> 01:21.600
Er... "Since you can buy Rolexes here
for a fiver and lunch for 50p,

01:21.600 --> 01:24.400
"you're standing in the world's
biggest pound shop.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.800
"You should therefore have no
trouble at all buying some wheels
for 15 million dong."

01:30.800 --> 01:32.680
15 million?!

01:32.680 --> 01:34.480
Are these full of money?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.920
Wow!

01:37.920 --> 01:40.560
Look at that! 15 million dong.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.960
I love the smell of money
in the morning.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.000
Smells like wheels!

01:49.960 --> 01:54.320
'Delighted that for once,
the producers had been generous,
we headed for the showrooms.'

01:54.320 --> 01:57.400
I love having inches of money!

01:57.400 --> 02:01.360
'But our joy was short-lived,
as James discovered,

02:01.360 --> 02:04.800
'when he tried to buy
a bog-standard Fiat 500.'

02:04.800 --> 02:06.280
Can you tell me how much?

02:06.280 --> 02:08.479
Um, 500...

02:08.479 --> 02:11.480
560 million Vietnam dong.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.400
560 million?! Yeah.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.280
How much is 15 million dong?

02:20.280 --> 02:22.920
Um, just about 1,000 US dollar.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.800
'Even the back-street car dealers
were no good.'

02:29.800 --> 02:31.960
Is it enough? For what?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.040
For a car?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.760
For the car? Yeah.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.960
What happen with the car?
You want to... To buy.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.880
To buy the car?!

02:41.880 --> 02:44.040
Yeah. Oh, I cannot.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.280
'Jeremy, meanwhile,
had become desperate.'

02:50.440 --> 02:54.480
Would you sell me your car?
Can I buy your car?'

02:54.480 --> 02:58.160
Sell me your car! Please!

03:02.320 --> 03:05.360
'And Hammond had given up
and gone for lunch.'

03:05.360 --> 03:07.680
Nothing.

03:07.680 --> 03:08.840
It is quite tricky.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.640
Pull up a chair, have a seat.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.400
What?! They're not very big.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.480
No! I've said to you all along,
you two are the freaks.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.960
This place
is perfectly scaled. I love it.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.600
'But Hammond's joy
at fitting in the chairs

03:22.600 --> 03:25.000
'wasn't going to
get us out of our hole.'

03:25.000 --> 03:30.160
I'll tell you the problem. Cars only
came to Vietnam a few years ago, OK?

03:30.160 --> 03:34.120
Four or five years ago. They've got
a 200% import tax on them.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.960
They haven't had time, in the
four or five years since they've
been here, to get cheap.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.080
There are no bangers.

03:41.250 --> 03:44.730
Everything's expensive
and we're actually quite poor.

03:44.730 --> 03:48.810
'It did look like we'd come
a long way for nothing,

03:48.810 --> 03:52.250
'but then James and I had an idea.'

03:59.730 --> 04:01.210
No.

04:01.210 --> 04:03.290
Go on. No.

04:03.290 --> 04:06.210
Look around us. What do we see
everywhere? No, I can't.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.530
You know I can't do that.

04:07.530 --> 04:09.130
What else is there?

04:09.610 --> 04:11.690
I bet you can get a bike for that.

04:11.690 --> 04:15.050
I bet you can get a lump
of excrement for that as well.

04:15.050 --> 04:19.170
It doesn't mean... It's transport
with an engine. It's the only choice.
Come on.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.050
No. Look, that's all we've got.

04:23.090 --> 04:25.410
Bikes.

04:27.050 --> 04:30.450
'James and I did have a point.

04:30.450 --> 04:38.010
'Because cars are so expensive
in Vietnam,

04:38.010 --> 04:43.410
'They're used for everything.
If you don't have a bike here,
you're a nobody.'

04:45.890 --> 04:49.050
'So we took the plunge as well,
and an hour later,

04:49.050 --> 04:53.890
'met up at the American War Museum
with our cheap-as-chips wheels.'

04:57.250 --> 04:59.410
I bought this. It's a Minsk.

04:59.410 --> 05:03.730
Russian, 125cc, and it's
basically the AK47 of bikes -

05:03.730 --> 05:05.850
rugged, simple, easy to repair.

05:05.850 --> 05:09.890
It is built specifically
to be used in countries
where there are no roads.

05:09.890 --> 05:12.650
It will be - for whatever
they throw at us - perfect.

05:14.650 --> 05:17.330
I've gone completely native
and I've bought this.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.690
It's an an ancient
Honda 50 Super Cub -

05:19.690 --> 05:22.130
the greatest motorcycle in history.

05:22.130 --> 05:24.890
Over 60 million of those
have been built,

05:24.890 --> 05:28.210
and it is a greater liberator
of the people than...

05:28.210 --> 05:31.450
well, that American tank,
for example.

05:31.450 --> 05:36.770
I've bought this, which is, um...
a motorcycle.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.410
This is a scooter. It is.

05:38.410 --> 05:42.090
Don't let go now. It'll fall over.
No. It's got a thing called a stand.

05:42.090 --> 05:45.250
You really don't know anything
about bikes, do you? Nothing.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.770
I tell you what,
it is actually very pretty.

05:47.770 --> 05:51.130
But it's gonna be useless,
because whatever the challenge is,

05:51.130 --> 05:55.530
tiny wheels and looking good won't
help you. Why are tiny wheels wrong?

05:55.530 --> 05:58.010
Little wheels go further
into the holes. What holes?

05:58.010 --> 05:59.410
The holes in the road.

05:59.410 --> 06:02.410
You'll be all over the place!

06:03.730 --> 06:05.650
How many cylinders has it got?

06:05.650 --> 06:08.410
JAMES AND RICHARD: One.
One?! It's two-stroke.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.930
'It was time
for the main challenge.'

06:10.930 --> 06:13.690
I promise you,
I'm not interested in this.

06:13.690 --> 06:18.770
"You'll now attempt to achieve
in eight days what the Americans
failed to achieve in ten years.

06:18.770 --> 06:22.330
"Get from the south
of Vietnam to the north.

06:22.330 --> 06:25.970
"You will ride from here in Saigon
to Ha Long City,

06:25.970 --> 06:29.290
"near the Chinese border,
which is 1,000 miles away."

06:29.290 --> 06:33.090
That is excellent! Wow! That's
the best challenge we've ever had.

06:33.090 --> 06:36.730
I'm going! Get his bike started.
Honestly, that is fantastic.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.850
I can't do that.
I just...can't do that.

06:40.850 --> 06:43.330
I can't do...

06:43.330 --> 06:45.730
Guys, I can't do that.

06:45.730 --> 06:47.210
I can't ride a bike.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.650
Ridiculous.
I'm sorry, this is stupid.

06:49.650 --> 06:53.730
I'm not joking. I don't know who
came up with this, but it's daft.

06:53.730 --> 06:56.250
I'm more excited
than anything we've ever done.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.650
I can't believe you're being
a misery-guts.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.810
It's 1,000 miles in the rainy
season! That's the best thing!

07:01.810 --> 07:05.530
1,000 miles, in the rainy season, in
a country with not very good roads,

07:05.530 --> 07:07.610
and I can't ride a bike!

07:08.690 --> 07:12.250
'There was good reason
for my despair.

07:12.250 --> 07:18.370
'The cities in Vietnam
are a seething cauldron
of barely organised chaos.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.010
'They're a death trap
for the inexperienced.

07:22.010 --> 07:25.050
'And in the countryside,
there's even more peril.

07:25.050 --> 07:28.850
'Four times more people here die
on the roads than in Britain.

07:30.130 --> 07:37.210
'I honestly believed that at some
point on our long and torturous
route, one of us would be killed.

07:37.210 --> 07:41.410
'Probably wouldn't be Hammond,
though, because unlike us two,

07:41.410 --> 07:44.850
'he at least could get
a helmet which fitted.'

07:44.850 --> 07:48.770
The reason I don't ride a motorcycle
is because I have a large brain.

07:48.770 --> 07:53.330
No, you have a big head. The reason
why...crash helmets are small

07:53.330 --> 07:57.010
is because people who wear
them haven't got a brain.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.210
Otherwise they'd have a car.

07:59.210 --> 08:03.330
'Since we were due to set off the
following morning,

08:03.330 --> 08:06.250

before, my Vietnamese hadn't been

I can't really turn my head, so...

08:55.650 --> 08:58.090
You're not excited, are you? No.

Yep. This is it? Yep.

Whoa! This is such a melee.

10:01.610 --> 10:06.970
I've been riding bikes for 25 years
and I've never done anything like
this. I think just improvise.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.090
It's amazing. It just sort of works!

10:09.090 --> 10:10.890
Do you know how to start it? No.

10:10.890 --> 10:12.410
All right, get on.

10:12.410 --> 10:16.530

they just trod on it and it started.

Oi! Whoa, wrong side of the road!

This is terrifying. It's just bikes
absolutely everywhere.

Oh my God, there's one stalled
in front of me.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.410
Best motorbike I've ever had.

Oh, get into gear, for God's sakes!
Stupid thing!

Gear box has a mind of its own,
there's no suspension,
it just wobbles!

It's just wobbling all the time!

Ah!

12:31.610 --> 12:37.090
Thanks for waiting, mate(!) Well I
thought, "Jeremy always waits for
me, so I'll not wait for him."

You knew damn well I wasn't!

was so undriveable.'

change the whole engine.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.370
"What noise did this make
when it was alive?

13:35.370 --> 13:39.330
"Tweet, tweet, tweet,"

13:39.330 --> 13:41.050
or did it go, "Neigh"?

13:42.610 --> 13:46.410
I think it went, "Ruff! Ruff!"

13:46.410 --> 13:48.210
But it's delicious.

13:48.210 --> 13:54.850
Um, well I think this thing here
is a sort of squid thing with some
weird paste. Don't like squid.

13:54.850 --> 13:58.690
OK, well you can have crab with...
I don't like crab.

13:59.730 --> 14:00.890
Razor clams.

14:00.890 --> 14:02.330
I don't like clams.

14:02.330 --> 14:08.770
'By now, the workforce had swelled
considerably, and as a result,
I was soon on the move again.'

14:08.770 --> 14:11.610
OK, the wheel is no longer wobbling,

14:11.610 --> 14:14.290
got a new engine, got a new gearbox,

14:14.290 --> 14:16.930
and it feels...exactly the same.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.690
Rubbish!

14:18.690 --> 14:19.930
Useless!

14:22.050 --> 14:25.410
'As James and I made smooth
progress toward De Lat,

14:25.410 --> 14:29.690
'we were reflecting on the pedigree
of our bargain basement bikes.'

14:31.690 --> 14:34.650
These bikes are quite a common sight
all over the world,

14:34.650 --> 14:40.490
and in certain places, they're
usually seen with members of the
Taliban on them, carrying AK-47s,

14:40.490 --> 14:42.690
and rocket launchers.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.730
This is the wheels of Asia.

14:46.730 --> 14:51.250
Over 60 million of these sold,
so if you combine the Beetle,

the Model T, all the versions
of the Toyota Corolla,

14:55.170 --> 14:59.690
and the Mini, you still haven't got
as many as you have of these.

about my bike's pedigree.'

15:06.610 --> 15:10.850
Work! Just work, for one minute!

15:13.970 --> 15:17.130
Further up the road,
things were getting hilly,

15:17.130 --> 15:19.330
which meant James was having problems

15:19.330 --> 15:22.410
with his Honda's miserable four
horse-power engine.

It's a lovely evening here in
south-east Asia, as you can see,

15:39.290 --> 15:43.610
and I'd be enjoying it any means of
transport apart from the motorbike.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.730
If somebody said to me,
"Would you like to hop to Hanoi?"

15:46.730 --> 15:48.130
Yes, I would.

15:50.570 --> 15:54.850
'The last few miles to De Lat
were really steep.'

15:54.850 --> 15:59.090
Just admit it, you should have
bought a more powerful bike.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.810
No! I'm not admitting it yet.

16:01.810 --> 16:03.250
I'm still going.

That's it.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.490
Where is it?!

17:14.490 --> 17:20.530
I quite like it here. I like the way
the roof's been made and the way the
sticks have been joined together.

Whoa! Blimey!

17:26.849 --> 17:30.010

got here, have you?
You just haven't seen me.

17:48.970 --> 17:52.250
What have you eaten? Piles of stuff.
He had some cornflakes.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.770
I was trying them in case
they were different.

17:54.770 --> 17:58.930
I like to try local
cultures and flavours
and they may have been different!

17:58.930 --> 18:05.250
But I'd been eating a squid, soup,
clam, bamboo shoot arrangement before
you came in. I had!

18:05.250 --> 18:07.450
'Then our ran arrived!'

18:07.450 --> 18:10.130
Oh God, I don't like snake.
It's going to be delicious.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.890
If I told you it was chicken...

18:11.890 --> 18:15.250
We'll have chicken then!
Could I have it medium-rare?

18:15.250 --> 18:16.890
What, a medium-rare snake?!

18:16.890 --> 18:19.290

Well done, I suppose!

Morning. Did YOU do this?

19:05.730 --> 19:07.770
Yes.

19:07.770 --> 19:10.330
We just wanted to make sure
it was strong enough.

19:10.330 --> 19:13.650
We were worried about you.
We were paralytically worried.

19:13.650 --> 19:14.930
I was blind worried.

19:14.930 --> 19:18.730
He was so worried on a couple of
occasions he fell over with worry.
How did you do it?

19:18.730 --> 19:22.610
We tested it under the wheels
of a lorry and look what happened.

19:22.610 --> 19:23.810
You tested it? Yes.

19:23.810 --> 19:26.330
So now that's... Ruined. Yes.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.890
Don't worry, though.

We've just been out to town

Don't take this the wrong way,

significance... Stop talking.

19:38.330 --> 19:43.610

that as feminine... Stop moving your
face about with noises coming out.

If you had a car, you'd pop it on
the back seat or in the boot. Yeah.

monotony only broken by a light
sprinkling of massive discomfort.'

Argh!

27:12.290 --> 27:13.890
Oh!

27:13.890 --> 27:16.010

be honest, is all right for you...

issue for you, I grant you that.

27:40.930 --> 27:43.330
Maybe in other areas...the girth!

27:43.330 --> 27:46.290
This is cashmere? Yes.
And how much is this...?

27:46.290 --> 27:49.290
The price for the whole thing,
125 US dollars.

27:49.290 --> 27:53.130
A cashmere suit for... £70!

27:53.130 --> 27:55.930
What, a whole suit,
or just the buttons? The whole suit.

27:55.930 --> 27:58.410
Made to measure.
Made to measure! How long...?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.290
It takes one day to finish.

28:00.290 --> 28:03.170
A day! So we can have any style.

28:03.170 --> 28:04.970
- Any style.
- And any material?

28:10.570 --> 28:13.530
Linen, not good.
Makes you look even fatter.

28:13.530 --> 28:16.530
Jonathan Ross would never wear...

28:16.530 --> 28:19.610
linen for that reason -
because he's getting quite portly.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.170
Ah, this is Chinese brocade.

28:22.170 --> 28:23.570
Chinese brocade. Yes.

28:23.570 --> 28:30.330
I don't know what that is. I don't
really know what I'm doing here cos
I'm not very fashion conscious.

28:31.410 --> 28:36.130
Your suit's ready. Here it is.
Thank you, thank you(!)

28:36.130 --> 28:38.490
Thank you, that's very nice.
It's perfect.

28:38.490 --> 28:43.610
They're measuring the biceps now.
Tape measure's not long enough.
Of course(!)

28:43.610 --> 28:49.090

under my armpit any longer,
it'll rot.

It's lovely,
but I don't fancy it today.

The first kick I took
was when I hit the ground.

31:42.010 --> 31:44.930
In a minute you're going to be
driving along with that blaring...

I was thinking more working
in a shop or on a building site,

modern. No, he doesn't do modern.

34:39.850 --> 34:42.889
He won't like that. No, he's very...
Old-fashioned.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.449
May! Welcome! Thanks for waiting.

34:46.449 --> 34:50.409

that you like the ballet.

So you have actually
thought about it? BOTH: Yup.

You're not going to believe how
they mended it. With a hammer? No.

36:05.090 --> 36:07.610
They got a plastic bag,
filled it with weeds,

36:07.610 --> 36:10.250

Yeah. We're going up that. Right.

got me a present? Oh, yes. Yeah.

after this, Hammond,

Every time I change down, Darcey
clouts me with her breasts!

'Meanwhile, to pay him back
for breaking it in the first place,

40:13.010 --> 40:16.490
'I decided to redecorate
his treasured bike.'

40:18.370 --> 40:22.930
You know he will be
apocalyptically cross.

40:22.930 --> 40:26.290
I know, but he's cross about
everything, so it doesn't really...

40:26.290 --> 40:28.890
Oh-ho-ho. Let's have a go.

40:28.890 --> 40:31.730
JEREMY CHORTLES
Oh, yes!

40:35.410 --> 40:37.490
Chao.

40:37.490 --> 40:39.810
You like? Would you like to do some?

40:39.810 --> 40:43.930
Would you like to do some? Pink!
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

40:43.930 --> 40:46.490
If he asks, we just say,
"The chef did it."

40:46.490 --> 40:49.770
If you painted the back,
he'd be furious. Down there.

40:52.170 --> 40:55.290
Do you have a pencil I could borrow?
A pencil? Yes.

41:00.730 --> 41:06.170
Now look what's happened.
The whole town has turned out to
paint Richard Hammond's bike pink.

41:06.170 --> 41:09.770
James and I are doing everything
possible to stop them...

41:09.770 --> 41:13.290
Please, don't do this!
I've given up trying to tell them.

41:14.690 --> 41:17.450
And you missed a bit there
that you mustn't do.

41:23.850 --> 41:25.250
Ah.

41:29.850 --> 41:31.410
Look, you can't just go...

41:31.410 --> 41:35.130
Hang on, has she painted her own
bike? Seriously, don't...it
isn't hers!

41:35.130 --> 41:39.530
What happened is, she's got hold of
this big paint and decided

41:39.530 --> 41:43.690
everything in the entire car park
needs painted pink!

41:43.690 --> 41:45.570
HE LAUGHS

41:48.970 --> 41:53.930
The sun rose over another
beautiful day in the 'Nam.

41:53.930 --> 41:56.970
But among us three,
the atmosphere was a little tense...

42:00.490 --> 42:02.570
I told you he'd be furious.

42:02.570 --> 42:05.730
Can they really not organise a
bloody junction better than this?

42:05.730 --> 42:08.290
I know he's cross
but I've told him a chef did it.

42:08.290 --> 42:10.610
Did he not believe you?
No. Funny, that.

42:11.610 --> 42:14.210
WHACK!
Oh dear.

42:14.210 --> 42:18.530
Despite Richard's mood, we were told
to report to a nearby

42:18.530 --> 42:21.210
government building for a challenge.

42:21.210 --> 42:23.370
I think it looks good!

42:23.370 --> 42:27.010
It matches your helmet now. Yes, I
have spotted that, that's the point,

42:27.010 --> 42:28.210
very good, yes.

42:28.210 --> 42:30.650
No, I am sorry.
We did everything in our power.

42:30.650 --> 42:33.730
You know we're your mates.
Anyway, we need a challenge.

42:33.730 --> 42:36.650
He is cross, but just read the
challenge, it'll cheer him up.

42:36.650 --> 42:39.610
It'll be the person with the
pinkest bike wins, I'll bet.

42:39.610 --> 42:42.090
The person with the pinkest bike...
There you go!

42:42.090 --> 42:44.730
No, it doesn't actually say that.
What does it say?

42:44.730 --> 42:48.090
You are about to enter
what was North Vietnam.

42:48.090 --> 42:50.930
It's as well your papers
are in order,

42:50.930 --> 42:53.930
you will therefore take a Vietnamese
driving test.

42:53.930 --> 42:59.130
Well, that'll just be one of those
joke ones. You know, the Egypt one?
Forwards and backwards six feet.

42:59.130 --> 43:00.410
Cheer up!

43:00.410 --> 43:02.530
This is gonna be a doddle.

43:02.530 --> 43:04.650
SHE SPEAKS IN VIETNAMESE

43:04.650 --> 43:05.770
It wasn't.

43:05.770 --> 43:08.850
First, we had to take
an aural theory test...

43:08.850 --> 43:10.610
in Vietnamese.

43:18.090 --> 43:20.290
May. May!

43:20.290 --> 43:21.970
Ahem!

43:21.970 --> 43:24.490
It's you. Stand up,
stand up, stand up!

43:26.770 --> 43:29.730
SHE CONTINUES IN VIETNAMESE

43:41.730 --> 43:42.930
Oh, no.

43:55.330 --> 43:57.650
Always give way to
the car from the right.

43:57.650 --> 43:59.170
JEREMY LAUGHS

44:00.250 --> 44:03.250
You've a one in a hundred chance
of being right, there.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.450
But you were in the wrong language.

44:05.450 --> 44:06.490
Uh-oh...

44:06.490 --> 44:07.970
THE OTHERS SNIGGER

44:15.450 --> 44:16.490
Er...

44:16.490 --> 44:19.970
HE SPEAKS VIETNAMESE

44:23.850 --> 44:26.570
How the hell did...
what did you just do?

44:26.570 --> 44:28.450
It was 18. 18 years old.

44:28.450 --> 44:29.650
How did you know?

44:29.650 --> 44:32.610
What age you are to ride
a motorbike, which of course is 18.

44:33.650 --> 44:34.690
But...

44:34.690 --> 44:37.330
How did you know what she asked?

44:37.330 --> 44:40.570
Did you not bother learning
Vietnamese before we came here?

44:40.570 --> 44:41.850
Well, no!

44:41.850 --> 44:43.090
You're screwed, then.

44:44.170 --> 44:47.250
So, only one of us had shone
in the classroom.

44:47.250 --> 44:50.170
But in the practical test,
things would be better.

44:51.090 --> 44:55.810
Is it you have to ride in a
figure-of-eight, then you can go out
and ride on Ho Chi Minh's highways?

44:55.810 --> 44:58.850
Yes. That's it? So if you
touch the white lines, you fail?

44:58.850 --> 45:00.050
Presumably.

45:00.050 --> 45:02.330
Barbara Cartland went first.

45:02.330 --> 45:04.050
Richard Hammond.

45:04.050 --> 45:05.290
Ooh, it's me!

45:07.410 --> 45:10.690
In. It's quite tight...

45:10.690 --> 45:13.930
Well, it serves him right for riding
an enormous motorcycle.

45:14.970 --> 45:16.570
Ooh, it's harder than it looks!

45:18.370 --> 45:19.850
Is he doing well?

45:19.850 --> 45:21.210
Good?

45:23.450 --> 45:25.610
Richard Hammond, pass.

45:25.610 --> 45:28.370
You've passed! He's passed!
You've passed!

45:28.370 --> 45:30.130
James May.

45:32.170 --> 45:34.370
He'll love this,
it's all about precision,

45:34.370 --> 45:36.810
going slowly and being accurate...

45:36.810 --> 45:38.850
Gone the wrong way...
HE LAUGHS

45:41.650 --> 45:44.690
It's a good spectator sport, though,
isn't it? It is.

45:44.690 --> 45:46.410
They're really loving it.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.050
James May.

45:48.050 --> 45:49.210
Pass.

45:49.210 --> 45:50.810
Tiny... Jeremy Clarkson.

45:50.810 --> 45:52.410
Get on with it! Yes, yes...

45:58.450 --> 46:00.890
Ah! Ah!

46:01.970 --> 46:04.410
No, that's not right!
What he's doing is,

46:04.410 --> 46:06.250
rather predictably, going too fast.

46:06.250 --> 46:09.850
This is just impossible on these
wheels. They're too small!

46:09.850 --> 46:11.370
Jeremy Clarkson...

46:11.370 --> 46:12.530
Fail.

46:12.530 --> 46:15.810
You've failed! I've only been
riding a bike five days!

46:15.810 --> 46:19.810
Happily, in Vietnam, if you fail
you are allowed to try again.

46:19.810 --> 46:20.890
Immediately.

46:20.890 --> 46:26.930
He's spent less time in the circle
than he has out of the circle.

46:28.010 --> 46:29.730
Oh!

46:29.730 --> 46:31.130
Jeremy Clarkson, fail.

46:31.250 --> 46:32.850
JAMES LAUGHS

46:32.850 --> 46:35.130
Obviously, it was
the Vespa's fault,

46:35.130 --> 46:37.690
so I had a go on the Cub.

46:37.690 --> 46:39.770
Give it gas, man! There you go!

46:41.530 --> 46:44.530
helping massively here.

46:47.210 --> 46:49.050
Oh, this is disastrous.

46:49.050 --> 46:50.770
How's he ridden this thing?!

46:52.210 --> 46:56.290
Jeremy Clarkson, fail.

46:56.290 --> 47:00.850
Is he the most ridiculous human being
in the world currently, or ever...

47:00.850 --> 47:02.010
ever previously?

47:02.010 --> 47:03.050
Yes. Yeah.

47:03.050 --> 47:04.610
We're gonna have to get going.

47:04.610 --> 47:06.170
But we haven't got a licence.

47:06.170 --> 47:08.810
Well, that's cos you
failed your theory.

47:08.810 --> 47:12.050
You haven't been granted a pass for
your practical, it's pathetic.

47:12.050 --> 47:15.490
But as a team... As a team we've
done both halves of it. As a unit...

47:15.490 --> 47:17.010
we are licensed.

47:17.010 --> 47:21.050
We are now licenced. We could have
a Top Gear licence, with
all our faces on it.

47:21.050 --> 47:23.650
As long as we stick
together. No! Oi!

47:24.770 --> 47:27.530
It was important, that.
I am sorry, James. I am.

47:27.530 --> 47:29.570
You're not sorry. Please shut up.

47:30.730 --> 47:33.530
To apologise for Darcey's head,

47:33.530 --> 47:37.650
I bought James some flowers
and then we headed out of Hue.

47:41.290 --> 47:43.410
BLEEP

47:47.450 --> 47:50.010
You've knocked one
of my mirrors off!

47:55.130 --> 48:00.090
Even though we were against
the clock, we felt we had to
stop at the citadel.

48:02.090 --> 48:05.730
Scene of one of the fiercest battles
in the Vietnam War.

48:06.810 --> 48:08.890
Bullet holes everywhere.

48:10.130 --> 48:12.450
And everywhere you look,
it's just...

48:12.450 --> 48:17.090
You can track them as well, can't
you, sometimes? That is
machine-gun fire there.

48:17.090 --> 48:20.730
I think, for most people, Vietnam
is a war, not a country. Yes.

48:20.730 --> 48:24.450
And this was pretty much
the epicentre.

48:24.450 --> 48:29.770
It's nice that they haven't restored
it. That's a better memorial than
anything else, isn't it?

48:33.770 --> 48:37.250
It was now day six
of our epic road trip,

48:37.250 --> 48:41.090
and the finish line was still more
than 400 miles away.

48:41.090 --> 48:44.210
What's more, the traffic
was getting worse.

48:44.210 --> 48:47.770
You can tell we're getting close
to the North... What, more bikes?

48:47.770 --> 48:49.370
Well, a lot more bikes.

48:49.370 --> 48:52.370
The heat was worse than ever,
and even James's Cub

48:52.370 --> 48:54.570
was starting to feel the strain.

48:55.610 --> 48:58.690
That's just not as sweet as it
was this morning.

48:58.690 --> 49:01.530
Progress, then,
was slower than ever...

49:01.530 --> 49:05.010
and over lunch, the penny dropped -
with a horrible clang.

49:05.010 --> 49:06.050
Rice...

49:06.050 --> 49:08.570
Yeah. Those are bamboo shoots. Yeah.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.490
And that's...meat. Some meat.

49:10.490 --> 49:11.570
Guys.

49:11.570 --> 49:12.850
Yeah?

49:12.850 --> 49:14.890
We can't make it.

49:16.850 --> 49:19.850
If you think how far
we've come so far,

49:19.850 --> 49:23.090
and how far we've got...
well, we're about halfway.

49:23.090 --> 49:25.730
Well, thinking about it,
probably that...

49:25.730 --> 49:29.050
that day spent playing on the beach
and having a massage,

49:29.050 --> 49:31.010
while we had our suits made...

49:31.010 --> 49:32.770
wasn't actually the... No. No.

49:32.770 --> 49:34.530
We can't just give in.

49:34.530 --> 49:37.130
So what're you saying?
We must try harder?

49:37.130 --> 49:40.770
No. We must find a way of making
the bikes faster? No. Cheat.

49:40.770 --> 49:41.970
Yep.

49:43.690 --> 49:47.650
We decided to take an overnight
train to Ha Long City,

49:47.650 --> 49:50.530
which is something the Americans
never thought to do.

49:50.530 --> 49:54.490
But we couldn't celebrate our
ingenuity, because at the station...

49:55.570 --> 49:59.570
James was a bit upset that my spare
wheel had come through my painting.

49:59.570 --> 50:01.370
Now look what you've done.

50:01.370 --> 50:04.250
What, I did it on purpose?
Hammond paid for it,

50:04.250 --> 50:08.410
and it was...well, we won't say
how much it was, but it
was quite expensive. Yes.

50:08.410 --> 50:13.170
You're not making me feel any
better. How d'you think we feel?
Let's not get bogged down

50:13.170 --> 50:15.290
with who did what to who.

50:15.290 --> 50:16.690
No, cos you did all of it.

50:17.770 --> 50:19.970
THEY GROAN
Argh! Come on!

50:19.970 --> 50:21.090
Wait, wait, wait.

50:21.090 --> 50:23.050
Ooh, sorry, sorry.

50:23.050 --> 50:27.050
In the night, can you water
the flowers for me?

50:27.050 --> 50:29.850
WHISTLE SOUNDS

50:29.850 --> 50:32.370
Sorry. Yeah, a tyre went through it.

50:32.370 --> 50:33.490
Sorry!

50:35.850 --> 50:40.370
James had bought the tickets,
and great news for licence payers -

50:40.370 --> 50:42.090
they were for third class!

50:42.090 --> 50:43.810
13 hours!

50:43.810 --> 50:45.450
There are people sleeping.

50:45.450 --> 50:47.050
HE WHISPERS
13 hours!

50:47.050 --> 50:49.090
How long have we done?

50:49.090 --> 50:50.170
Four minutes.

50:50.170 --> 50:51.850
Getting through it!

50:55.770 --> 51:00.170
We decided to pass the rest
of the time by mending each
others' presents.

51:02.050 --> 51:04.170
Ooh. Oooh...

51:04.170 --> 51:06.970
Moves about more than I expected,
but that's OK.

51:06.970 --> 51:11.610
It'll give the painting some motion,
some fluidity. It's good. It's good.

51:11.610 --> 51:15.250
That's like trying to unravel
the mystery of the universe.

51:15.250 --> 51:16.610
Made of string.

51:16.610 --> 51:18.050
CLATTERING

51:18.050 --> 51:20.570
In the accident,
we've lost her hand.

51:20.570 --> 51:24.930
The thing that...maybe
I could improvise that
and make that her hand,

51:24.930 --> 51:27.970
and then she's like
a sort of mutant.

51:27.970 --> 51:30.730
What I've done is inject
a touch of the familiar

51:30.730 --> 51:33.530
to this otherwise quite alien scene.

51:33.530 --> 51:34.650
Aah! Aah!

51:34.650 --> 51:36.450
Aah. Why is that so hot?

51:36.450 --> 51:37.570
Is that glue?

51:37.570 --> 51:38.930
Why's it so hot?

51:38.930 --> 51:40.330
My suit!

51:40.330 --> 51:42.970
I've dropped hot glue on my suit!

51:42.970 --> 51:46.330
Do you have anything to cure
superglue burns through silk?

51:46.330 --> 51:49.650
My hand's in the front
of my trousers, don't read
anything into that.

51:57.490 --> 52:00.330
MUSIC: "Ring Of Fire"
by Johnny Cash

52:05.570 --> 52:10.170
In the morning, the train was
approaching our destination.

52:11.170 --> 52:14.570
James is going to be extremely
pleased with...

52:14.570 --> 52:19.410
Not so much with this, but
the surgery on her shoulder...

52:19.410 --> 52:22.370
That is the work of a top doc.

52:22.370 --> 52:26.130
It's difficult to explore
the allegorical significances

52:26.130 --> 52:28.850
and layers of the painting when
I'm...well, sober.

52:28.850 --> 52:30.370
What you've done...

52:30.370 --> 52:34.330
is you've painted a Land Rover in
the middle of a Vietnamese scene.

52:34.330 --> 52:37.610
Yeah. The... Mind you, you're in
for a bug surprise when you see

52:37.610 --> 52:39.330
what May's done to your galleon.

52:40.570 --> 52:42.730
It's not brilliant, mate,
if I'm honest.

52:42.730 --> 52:44.570
And what are these? Chopsticks.

52:46.170 --> 52:47.810
But what are they representing?

52:47.810 --> 52:49.250
Oars.

52:49.250 --> 52:52.850
It's the best I could do with
the bits that survived

52:52.850 --> 52:55.770
and stuff I could buy from
the woman with the trolley.

52:57.050 --> 52:58.930
Finally, two days early,

52:58.930 --> 53:01.090
we arrived in Ha Long City.

53:01.090 --> 53:02.730
Where's her hand?

53:02.730 --> 53:04.410
I've completely lost it.

53:12.930 --> 53:14.210
HORN TOOTS

53:18.730 --> 53:20.610
Move this out the way... Sorry?

53:20.610 --> 53:22.930
This is heavy presumably...

53:24.330 --> 53:26.010
Darcey's head's come off again.

53:30.330 --> 53:32.610
Don't touch it! OK.

53:34.690 --> 53:37.970
This has been the clumsiest arrival
at a finishing point.

53:37.970 --> 53:41.490
It hasn't been an elegant arrival,
but we are at the finishing point.

53:41.490 --> 53:43.530
It's very hot. Is it hotter
here than it was?

53:43.530 --> 53:45.690
Isn't there a sea breeze?

53:47.210 --> 53:49.890
How do you spell Ha Long?

53:51.170 --> 53:53.290
H-A-L-O-N-G.

53:53.290 --> 53:54.890
It's two words.

53:54.890 --> 53:58.770
G-A. I think that means train
station, I think. Ga.

53:58.770 --> 54:02.090
Ha Noi. Ha... Ha Noi.

54:03.210 --> 54:05.530
Well, where did you
book the tickets to?

54:05.530 --> 54:09.730
There's nothing wrong
with the tickets. Well, clearly,
we're in the wrong place.

54:09.730 --> 54:10.850
Yes. But...

54:10.850 --> 54:13.810
Ha Long City. Ha Long City.
Ha Long City.

54:13.810 --> 54:16.810
You chose the platform. You said,
"I know where it is!"

54:16.810 --> 54:19.610
There's one platform, James.
There's one line.

54:19.610 --> 54:22.810
There was a line either
side of the platform,
like there often is.

54:22.810 --> 54:27.290
'A quick look at a map showed us
the scale of my colleague's cock up.'

54:27.290 --> 54:30.090
There is Ha Long. Yeah.

54:30.090 --> 54:31.890
There is Hanoi.

54:31.890 --> 54:34.210
Well, we're miles away!

54:34.210 --> 54:36.650
We'll have to go along there.
It's a day's ride.

54:36.650 --> 54:38.850
All right, anyway,
welcome to Hanoi!

54:40.930 --> 54:44.090
"Oh no, I'll get the tickets.
I know what I'm doing.

54:44.090 --> 54:45.930
"I understand public transport."

54:45.930 --> 54:50.010
"No, no, trust me. I promise
you it's this platform."

54:50.010 --> 54:55.050
'To make matters worse, the traffic
was more mental than ever.'

54:55.050 --> 55:00.690
I'm utterly, utterly marmalated
here. I've never been more in peril.

55:00.690 --> 55:05.930
'But we were ahead of schedule,
so we went for breakfast.'

55:05.930 --> 55:08.050
These are chicken innards.

55:08.050 --> 55:11.330
Well, actually it doesn't say
innards, it says "internals".

55:11.330 --> 55:14.610
Mm. We've ordered pickled pig's ear

55:14.610 --> 55:19.330
with vegetables dipped in
seasoning sauce, spelt wrong.

55:19.330 --> 55:23.770
'Hammond didn't fancy
any of that and nor did he
go for the main course.'

55:23.770 --> 55:27.570

have arrived.

55:27.570 --> 55:30.650
Oh, look at that!

55:30.650 --> 55:33.490
Wafer-thin sparrow? I'm fine.

55:33.490 --> 55:36.490
Go on! A "wafer-thin" sparrow!
I'm fine.

55:36.490 --> 55:41.610
'But after seven days,
he had to eat something.'

55:41.610 --> 55:44.090
Good news!

55:44.090 --> 55:47.370
Richard Hammond is eating rice.

55:47.370 --> 55:49.490
It's rice crispies, but...

55:49.490 --> 55:51.330
Is it rice?

55:51.330 --> 55:53.810
Yes. Am I eating it
with chopsticks? Yes.

55:53.810 --> 55:56.250
Then I am native and local as you.

and they never bothered to move it.

56:11.130 --> 56:15.690
'And soon we realised it
wasn't just Hanoi's traffic
that was confusing.'

56:15.690 --> 56:20.290
I have no idea where
we are and no idea...

56:20.290 --> 56:22.530
Not one sign post.

out of the city,

56:32.170 --> 56:33.770
'and into the countryside.'

56:39.970 --> 56:42.810
Ha Long and Hanoi
are two big cities.

56:42.810 --> 56:46.170
I doubt they're connected by
a three-foot wide dusty path

56:46.170 --> 56:47.370
covered in hay.

56:47.370 --> 56:50.770
You know when we got the 16th
century, I think we turned left.

56:50.770 --> 56:53.770

is not the main road from... No.

57:08.170 --> 57:10.530
Where is Ha Long City?

57:10.530 --> 57:13.970
No, no. This isn't
Ha Long City, is it? No.

57:16.650 --> 57:19.130
I like being lost here.

57:19.130 --> 57:21.130
Yeah, this is a nice place
to be lost.

57:21.130 --> 57:22.850
Hello, hello!

57:22.850 --> 57:24.290
Hello! Oh, oh!

57:25.850 --> 57:26.970
THEY GIGGLE

57:26.970 --> 57:28.410
Yep.

57:30.450 --> 57:32.010
THEY LAUGH

57:35.130 --> 57:37.770
'Eventually, though...'

57:37.770 --> 57:39.810
We've found a road!

57:41.290 --> 57:45.450
'It really did look like we were
going to make it.'

57:48.490 --> 57:50.930
I've always said to my children,

57:50.930 --> 57:53.210
that if they buy a bike
I will burn it,

57:53.210 --> 57:56.850
and if they replace it with another
one, I shall burn that too.

57:56.850 --> 57:59.450
Now, however, if they buy a bike,

57:59.450 --> 58:01.530
I will completely understand...

58:02.530 --> 58:04.370
..and then I'll burn it.

58:06.730 --> 58:10.450
With just 50 miles to go,
Hammond went berserk.

58:10.450 --> 58:14.450
A-a-a-a-a-ah!

58:14.450 --> 58:16.450
The speed!

58:16.450 --> 58:18.250
He's just a prat.

58:20.690 --> 58:23.490
Oh, no! No, no, no!
I'm breaking down.

in the gentleman's region

58:55.690 --> 58:58.370

off the galleon.

were even still buying each other
silly presents.'

59:25.770 --> 59:29.450
So there we are. It's
my first bike crash, so I'm
a member of the club now.

59:29.450 --> 59:31.210
Don't like it. Hate biking.

59:31.210 --> 59:32.330
It's a stupid idea.

59:33.410 --> 59:35.610
My foot hurts quite badly,

59:35.610 --> 59:37.450
cos the bike landed on it.

59:37.450 --> 59:40.170
Got cracked ribs probably,
my elbow's ruined.

59:40.170 --> 59:41.810
Look at my suit!

250 miles on a train,

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:22.930

these old, broken, tiny wee bikes

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:30.530

Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:04.090
We've gone from the South
to the North of Vietnam.

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.130
We've proved to the Americans
it's possible!

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:15.010
We did it!

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.810
Fantastic. I cannot believe all
three bikes...

01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:23.930
Congratulations. Congratulations.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:27.530
Congratulations. Wounded?
Yes, I am a bit. Well done, mate.
Good stuff.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:30.130
That's it. I became a biker.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:34.050
Oh, I'm being left
in the field of battle,
but a few beers and it'll...

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:36.850
What? That'll just be to say
congratulations.

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:41.650
It'll just... Open it. "Well done!"
It won't say that.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.530
You think it'll say that?

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:46.410
Well, it is. "Well done." It doesn't.
What does it say?

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:48.770
It says, "You haven't finished."
Oh, come on!

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:50.330
No, well, that's...

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.570
But we have finished.

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:55.450

point is...

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.370
"Bar Hang in Ha Long Bay.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:02.370

"It's probably a good idea to modify
your bikes so they can float."

No, but look on the bright side.
No. What?

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:13.170
No. No, think.

01:02:13.170 --> 01:02:15.770
If it's possible here to get
a helmut made overnight,

01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:19.010
it must be possible to get your bike
converted into...

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:21.410
a Jet Ski overnight as well.
It has to be.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:23.210

be the other way.

01:02:57.450 --> 01:03:01.970
The next morning, we stood
on the beach and looked out
over Ha Long Bay,

01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:06.930
which was quite simply Vietnam's
biggest surprise.

01:03:11.690 --> 01:03:17.450
It is a spectacular limestone maze,
and hidden in there somewhere
was our bar.

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:23.050
All we had to do was find it,
and luckily we had just
the machines for the job.

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:31.770
James had attached his bike to a
traditional fishing boat,

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:33.850
using the engine to power
the propeller.

01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:39.410
You've just completely disassembled
your motorcycle. It isn't
a motorbike any more.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:43.850
Front wheels, gone. Engine isn't
where it's supposed to live.

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:47.890
There's nothing in the rules that
says the engine has to stay
in the same place.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:51.010
That...is magnificent! I know.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.610
I've gone with the Minsk principles
of simplicity, you see.

01:03:54.610 --> 01:03:56.890
I have a rudder,
steerable from the bars.

01:03:56.890 --> 01:04:00.410
Cables, and then it's just a chain
drive down to prop and I'm away.

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:02.890
And that's just the standard pedalo,
sort of...

01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:05.210
Yeah, this is a pedalo with
extra floats on it.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:13.050
'I'd been even more ingenious,
turning my Vespa into a
Mississippi-style paddle steamer.'

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:17.170
Now, as it turned out, my simple
plan was very difficult

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:21.330
cos the Vespa weighs 940,000 tonnes.

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:24.810
So I needed four canoes
full of foam.

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.930

is that with cracked ribs,

'I couldn't operate
the kick start.'

01:04:31.050 --> 01:04:34.850
Could you start my engine for me,
cos neither of my legs are working?

As you're injured,
I'll reduce the price.

01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:39.730

It's working!

01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.810
I have propulsion!

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.010
Hey, hey!

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:54.130
'But then in true Top Gear
amphibious tradition,

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:56.690
'it all went wrong for James.

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:59.130
'First he crashed into me.'

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:01.730
Go away! I'm trying.

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.770
Why are you doing this to me?

01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:05.970
It's that way, you blithering idiot!

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:08.050
'Then he crashed into some netting.'

01:05:08.050 --> 01:05:09.730
Oh, bloody hell!

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:12.970
'And then as Hammond
and I got going...'

01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:17.210
Yeah! Once you've got it going,
it's like...water-skiing! Woo-hoo!

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:18.970
'..he sank.'

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.330
No! No! Cock.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.490
Why's it done that?

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:28.250
'As his boat was towed
back to shore,

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:31.570
'Richard and I thought about
going back to help...

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.370
'but we didn't.'

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:39.170
I did not expect anything like this.

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:41.010
It's magnificent!

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:45.050
James meanwhile on the beach, in
what can only be described

01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:49.050
as a crashed airliner.
A scene from Lost.

01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:54.170
I've found Hammond's spare pontoons

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:58.850
from the workshop over there.
I've employed these local blokes
to use the best traditional,

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:03.010
Vietnamese boat-building
knot technology
to lash it all together

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:07.610
to give me more buoyancy,
stop the stern falling into
the water and stop it filling up.

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:11.130
"Phut, phut"s away
and off I go, but I've got
a lot of catching up to do.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:15.890
'Out in the bay,
there are problems too.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:19.890
'My Vespa had stalled
and I needed Hammond's leg
to kick it back into life.'

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:21.930
OK. Ah!

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:24.050
Right. I'll get on my bike.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:27.050
Ah!

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:36.250
ENGINE STUTTERS

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.450
BLEEP!!

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:39.730
That was truly ridiculous.

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:41.770
All we've got to do
is get back to yours.

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:45.210
Oh! Arse-y hell!

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.330
We're going well so far(!)
Very well(!)

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:52.330
'Half an hour later, my new,
improved boat was ready.

01:06:52.330 --> 01:06:54.370
'So I set off in pursuit
of the others,

01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:56.490
'and the illusive bar.'

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.450
Come on!

01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:02.570
1,969 islands in here.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.690
Bar Hang? Hello. Bar Hang?

01:07:09.610 --> 01:07:12.090
Bar Hang? I think
he thinks we're idiots.

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:13.570
Come on!

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:15.250
Yes!

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:18.490
Where'd they go?

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:21.010
'We'd got desperate,

01:07:21.010 --> 01:07:24.850
'and had even resorted
to looking in caves.'

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:29.690
You know when Attenborough travels
the world and goes to incredible
natural sights like this?

01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:33.530
He doesn't usually pitch up on a
homemade amphibious scooter. No.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:37.570
And that's where
he's been going wrong.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:40.010
# It's not a big motorcycle

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:43.090
# Just a groovy little motorbike

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:47.410
# It's more fun than a barrel
of monkeys, that two-wheel bike... #

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:50.610
OK, if you've just tuned in to
Britain's favourite car show,

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:55.130
what's happened is, Richard
and I have driven into a cave,

01:07:55.130 --> 01:08:00.610
looking for a bar that isn't here
and we have no reverse gear.

01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:03.930
'Still...could be worse.'

01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:09.930
God, that was going so well. My
traditional Vietnamese fishing knots

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:11.970
have come undone,

01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:15.690
and my centuries-old fibreglass
outrigger has drifted away.

01:08:15.690 --> 01:08:17.729
This is gonna work.

01:08:17.729 --> 01:08:24.210
'After a 1,000 point turn, Jeremy
and I were out of the cave!'

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:27.609
I wasn't worried, I wasn't scared.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:34.010
'And with only a few hours of
daylight left, we really couldn't
afford any more problems.'

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.729
Ah!

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:38.370
Water has got into
the electrical system,

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:44.130
and the 60,000 V is coursing through
everything that's metal,

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:47.490
including the frame on the boat,
the frame of the bike...

01:08:48.649 --> 01:08:50.850
'Our bike-skis were in a bad way.'

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.290
Come on!

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:55.010
'But then...'

01:08:55.010 --> 01:09:00.170
Life! There's life!

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.689
It's an umbrella! It's a bar!

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:05.810
Yes!

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:11.970
The little speck over there
is Hammond, I'm sure of it!

01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:15.609
Hammond!

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.810
It's there!

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:21.090
'Sadly, there wasn't much I could do
with this information...'

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.529
BLEEP! BLEEP!

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:24.529
BLEEP! ..piece of... BLEEP!

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:27.890
'..because my steering was broken.'

01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:29.609
All I can do is go in circles.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:35.569
'And so it seemed the non-biker
would get there first.'

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:38.210
Come on!

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.210
Yes!

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:57.170
And that is how we do that.

01:09:57.170 --> 01:10:00.850
'The question now was
would all of us make it

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:04.330
before the eight-day deadline
expired at sundown?

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:06.410
BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP!

01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:14.130
Wah! I can't do anything cos I
haven't got reverse.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:19.090
'Eventually, blind luck brought
Hammond close to the pontoon

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:22.850
'where I was sadly too busy
to help him moor.'

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:26.890
Just that bit of rope there, look!
That rope is long enough.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.130
Swim.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:29.210
No.

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:34.930
Come on.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.730
Another foot.

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:41.690
But your back into it!

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:45.090
'With the swan lined up, I gave
the engine a burst.'

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:46.570
ENGINE REVS

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.530
Ah! A-ha!

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:50.370
Damn it. Ha ha ha!

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:51.690
JEREMY LAUGHS

01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.050
Yes!

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.690
Ha ha ha!

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.490
Using nothing but currents
and the wind,

01:10:57.490 --> 01:11:00.250
Richard Hammond's idiotic Minsk
appears to have made it.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:02.730
Have a beer.

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:08.770
'Now there were two of us to savour
this amazing location.'

01:11:08.770 --> 01:11:11.450
I've just been finding out
about this place.

01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:13.770
The people who live here
are born here.

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.890
They live here, they fish here
and they die here.

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.930
They never go on dry land.
Never go on dry land.

01:11:19.930 --> 01:11:23.410
They spend their whole lives
floating? Yeah, they float around.

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:28.330
'Floating, though was becoming an
issue for our colleague, who'd just
lost his second pontoon.'

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:29.530
JEREMY LAUGHS

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:31.650
It's fallen apart.

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.210
Oh, come on!

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:42.890
THEY LAUGH

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:55.730
Yeah, when we left Saigon, "But I
think one thing I can guarantee

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:57.650
"is that my bike will make it"!

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:04.930
It's been quite a journey.
That's the way it ends!

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:06.930
I don't believe it!

01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:08.290
THEY LAUGH

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:13.530
This is the worst arrival at a place,
ever made by anyone, James.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:18.050
The fact is though,
it was an arrival.

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:20.290
Our little bikes had made it.

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:24.930
Oh, sure, there'd been breakdowns,
accidents and squabbles,

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.850
but through the rain,
the draining humidity,

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:29.930
the mad traffic
and the tricky roads,

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:33.530
they'd brought us 1,000 miles.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.050
Nearly.

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:41.250
I have to say though
that despite the success,
I'm still not sold on biking.

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:44.730
There are good moments,
but it's mostly bad.

01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:48.530
And I'm sorry, but our machines
were completely overshadowed

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:53.690
by this incredible, beautiful,
brilliant country.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:58.180
It's hard to sum it up, really.
Perhaps that's why people when they
get back from this place,

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:00.100
Always say the same thing

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.450
"Vietnam...

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.810
AMERICAN ACCENT:
"You don't know, man!

01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:04.970
"You weren't there!"
