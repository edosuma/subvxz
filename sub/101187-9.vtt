00:00.584 --> 00:02.336
- Amigos, amigos.

00:02.419 --> 00:03.879
Peace. Peace.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.464
- Paz, paz, paz.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.883
- Paz.
- Paz, paz. Paz.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.469
- Shit, I think
it's actually working.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.640
- Shit!

00:28.946 --> 00:30.405
Is he dead?

00:30.489 --> 00:32.783
- I mean, he took a lot of bullets.
I think so.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.160
- Oh, we got to check,
we got to check, see if he's still alive.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.374
He dead. He dead.
- Yeah.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.125
Yeah.
- He fucking dead.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.628
- Okay, okay, maybe if we just stay quiet,

00:44.711 --> 00:47.047
they'll leave.
- I like that plan. Yeah.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.966
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Juan, Ortiz,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.759
Go inside.
If there's any witnesses, kill them.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.262
- I hate that plan. Go.
- We need to wait.

00:53.345 --> 00:56.223
- Fuck. Close it, close it, close it.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.975
Hold it, hold it.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.983
Hey, do we got any more real bullets?

01:06.066 --> 01:07.442
- I checked already, they're blanks.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.069
- What do you mean, they fucking blanks?

01:09.152 --> 01:11.905
Is everything in here a fucking prop?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.365
What about the knife?
The knife I stabbed you with.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.742
- Oh, it was retractable. Fake blood.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.160
- Oh, shit!

01:17.244 --> 01:18.912
Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:18.996 --> 01:21.415
Shit. Go, go, go, go.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.387
- Kevin?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.930
- Yeah?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.599
- Um, if anything happens,

01:38.682 --> 01:41.310
and we don't get out of here alive,

01:41.393 --> 01:44.021
I just want you to know that...
- Stop.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.607
I love you, too.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.442
- Uh...

01:48.525 --> 01:50.861
- Shit, you were gonna say something else,
weren't you?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.071
You gonna say it was nice knowing me?

01:53.155 --> 01:54.740
- Yeah.
- Fuck me!

01:54.823 --> 01:57.159
We're about to die.
You could have at least lied.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.702
I mean, you been lying this entire week.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.953
Wouldn't have made
that big of a difference.

02:00.037 --> 02:03.123
- I'm sorry. I was hired to play a role,

02:03.207 --> 02:04.875
and they paid me a lot of money.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.418
Like, a lot.

02:06.502 --> 02:07.961
- You're not making it any better.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.379
You're actually making it a lot worse.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.382
- Shh. Did you hear that?
- Shit, they're coming.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.176
Play dead.
- What? No.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.385
- They'll walk in here,
they'll see that we're dead,

02:15.469 --> 02:17.804
then they'll leave.
- But how-how did we die?

02:17.888 --> 02:20.224
- I can't hear you, I'm dying.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.868
- What the...

02:51.046 --> 02:53.507
- Oy. Did you hear that?

02:53.590 --> 02:54.633
- Yeah. I think it's Ortiz.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.387
Oh. Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?!

02:58.470 --> 03:01.348
It's not fucking rocket science.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.154
- Kick me, bitch? Well, kick this!

03:19.491 --> 03:23.161
Kick me twice, shame on me.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.750
Kick me... shoot you...

03:46.602 --> 03:48.604
Every time I look up,
you're on your fucking back.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.523
Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.658
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold it.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.744
Okay, come on.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.752
You think you can win a gun fight

04:11.835 --> 04:13.003
with a Columbian drug lord?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.796
- No. We don't have guns in England.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.215
Didn't you say you're from North Philly?

04:16.298 --> 04:18.550
- What are you doing?
I can't take the gun like that.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.010
Give it to me right.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.762
- Yeah. Ron would be proud.

04:21.845 --> 04:24.264
- Shut up, "Ron would be proud."

04:24.348 --> 04:25.474
Ron would be proud.

04:25.557 --> 04:26.517
Shit!

04:28.018 --> 04:31.563
Go, go, go, go. Go, go. Fuck. Fuck.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.190
Oh. No.

04:43.492 --> 04:46.245
- Okay, I'm gonna create a distraction,

04:46.328 --> 04:47.913
and then you're gonna shoot the guy.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.331
- Yeah.
- Are you ready?

04:49.414 --> 04:51.208
- I've never been more ready in my life.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.794
- On three. One, two...

04:53.877 --> 04:55.546
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't-don't count like that.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.006
Go the other way. Three, two...
Like that. That's better for me.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.385
- Three, two, one.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.138
Go, go, go.
- It's go time.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.559
Yeah, motherfucker.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.227
Yeah, motherfucker!

05:12.437 --> 05:14.314
Goddamn it...

05:14.398 --> 05:17.442
Fuckin' stop. I'm out!
I'm out! I'm out! Fuck!

05:19.152 --> 05:21.280
Fuck. Almost got him.

05:21.363 --> 05:23.407
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.744
- Okay, he's reloading.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.288
Follow me, quick.
- Okay.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.874
Wait, wait. Wait for me. Wait for me.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.421
Damn it. I can't believe I missed his ass.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.047
I had him. The sight.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.382
It's got to be the sight.
The sight is off...

05:40.465 --> 05:42.176
- No, Kevin,
you just can't shoot for shit.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.510
We need to think.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.180
There has to be something
in here we can use.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.765
- Guess what we can't use. This.
It's out of bullets.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.225
I ain't got no more bullets.

05:50.309 --> 05:52.144
- Kevin, focus.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.562
- It's props.

05:53.645 --> 05:57.399
It's a bunch of fucking props over here.

06:02.154 --> 06:05.199
Whoop, there it is.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.660
- Oh, hell no! Oh, hell no!

06:49.743 --> 06:53.247
Oh, hell no-no-no-no...

06:53.330 --> 06:56.124
- Got you, motherfucker!

06:56.208 --> 06:58.460
Oh, oh, shit.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.880
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

07:04.675 --> 07:06.134
Hold his ass.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.350
Oh, you thought it was over, didn't you?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.018
But I don't travel alone.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.479
No. I got my friends with me.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.358
Let me introduce you
to Mr. Fuck Shit and Mr. Up.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.569
- Kevin, shut up!
- Okay. No, no, I--

07:23.652 --> 07:27.072
I got more, but I can--
Hold him. Motherfucker...

07:27.155 --> 07:29.616
Shit!

07:29.700 --> 07:31.159
I thought you had his feet!

07:34.329 --> 07:36.498
Shit. Yeah.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.042
We got his ass.
- I got him.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.920
- Ain't no "I" in "team." Put it up here.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.214
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Watch your step.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.258
Watch your step. Let's go.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.801
He kicked me right in the fucking nose,

07:47.885 --> 07:49.052
the son of a bitch.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.186
Run. Run.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.820
Oh... hey...

08:06.904 --> 08:08.030
Wait a minute. Jordan.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.281
Jordan, slow down. It's a cliff.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.033
It's a cliff! It's a cliff!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.122
Oh, shit.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.001
- Come on, we've got to go.
- I can't.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.086
I can't do that. That's too far.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.338
I'm sorry.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.089
- Jesus Christ, just jump.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.758
- Just go. Go save yourself.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.885
- No. We're both getting out of here.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.345
Now hurry the fuck up!

08:33.889 --> 08:35.557
- Fuck.

08:35.641 --> 08:37.017
Fuck, fuck.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.102
Fuck. Fuck!

08:40.604 --> 08:42.898
Go.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.399
Go, go, go...

08:44.483 --> 08:46.818
Shit. Oh.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.032
Why didn't you say you love me back?

08:52.115 --> 08:55.494
- Uh... I don't know.

08:55.577 --> 08:58.539
We-we're just kind of getting
to know each other, and...

09:04.044 --> 09:06.046
- Say good night.
