so differently than I do.

00:14.710 --> 00:18.018
I love you.I'm sorry.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.022
Erik has granted you
primary custody?

00:22.065 --> 00:23.371
He'll still have Mauricio
in Hawaii

00:23.414 --> 00:25.025
for summers and holidays;
we're gonna figure out

00:25.068 --> 00:26.069
a way to make it work.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.636
I can't believe
Bull turned it over.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.073
What do you mean?If it were me,

00:30.117 --> 00:32.510
I'd have buried it so deep
no one would've ever found it.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.425
Bradley, it would have been
an ethics violation.

00:34.469 --> 00:37.037

00:37.080 --> 00:38.647

Smokestack class-action suit.

Everybody's gotta get out.

You gotta leave.

Everybody out!

01:10.679 --> 01:13.334

01:16.728 --> 01:18.513
Come on, everyone, let's go!

Carbon monoxide leak.

He passed out.

01:43.277 --> 01:46.236
His wife's still in there.
I can show you where she is.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.760
No, you can't go back in there.I have to go back in there.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.154
Mister, listen!This is my building.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.677
I can't just leave
them all to die.

01:52.721 --> 01:54.505
Listen, listen,
you need to calm down

01:54.549 --> 01:56.812

just stay to your right,

01:56.855 --> 01:59.206

Let the firefighters through.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.772
Just one with me.
Top floor.

02:00.816 --> 02:02.774
ED:
I did everything I could.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.777
I really did. There was just
nothing more I could do.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.345
Well, let's examine
that statement, Mr. Wilson.

02:08.389 --> 02:11.218
You are the sole owner of the
apartment building, correct?

02:11.261 --> 02:13.785
Uh, yes, I-I've owned it
for years.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.397
And as such, you're responsible
for its upkeep,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.225
for its maintenance.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.792
Yes. That's correct.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.446
And because you're
responsible,

02:22.490 --> 02:24.622
you'd heard from
a city inspector

02:24.666 --> 02:26.755
that the boiler
in the basement was failing

02:26.798 --> 02:28.800
and needed to be replaced,
isn't that correct?

02:28.844 --> 02:31.194
That's true, but the cost...

02:31.238 --> 02:33.327
Yes or no, Mr. Wilson?

02:33.370 --> 02:35.198
Yes.

02:35.242 --> 02:37.157
Okay.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.203
But instead of replacing
the boiler, what did you do?

02:40.247 --> 02:42.901
I told my maintenance man
Nicholas to fix it.

02:42.945 --> 02:45.469
Nicholas Borrego, right?
What happened to him?

02:46.514 --> 02:49.604
He... he died.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.649
That's right, he died.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.695
And five other people died.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.611
They all went to sleep
and never woke up

02:56.654 --> 02:59.875
because the boiler
in the building failed,

02:59.918 --> 03:02.443
as you were warned would happen.

03:02.486 --> 03:06.186
They died because you were
trying to save a buck.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.710
Can he say that?
Is it gonna be like this?

03:08.753 --> 03:11.234
No, it's gonna be worse.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.194
The other side's gonna be
way harder on you than that.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.675
I'm not doing very well, am I?

03:17.719 --> 03:19.808
You'll get better.

03:19.851 --> 03:22.376
It feels to me, Ed,

03:22.419 --> 03:24.247
like you're holding back.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.337
But these people need
to understand how you feel.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.339
Six people died
in your building.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.343
How does that make you feel?

03:33.387 --> 03:35.432
It feels horrible.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.695
It's devastating.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.654
Okay. Keep going.

03:42.396 --> 03:44.528
I still can't believe
it happened.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.878
I knew those tenants.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.707
Some of them had been
in my building for years.

03:49.751 --> 03:51.318
You took care of them.

03:51.361 --> 03:55.365
I always took care
of the people in my building.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.367
Then why didn't you replace
the boiler

03:57.411 --> 03:59.326
when you learned it was failing?

03:59.369 --> 04:00.718
I wanted to.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.851
But with the pandemic

04:02.894 --> 04:06.420
and all the supply chain issues
a-and inflation,

04:06.463 --> 04:08.726
it was gonna cost
five times what it should've

04:08.770 --> 04:10.250
for me to replace it.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.252
I just didn't have
that kind of money,

04:12.295 --> 04:14.558
not after two years'
rent forbearance.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.734
Nicholas assured me

04:16.778 --> 04:18.040
he could fix it,

04:18.083 --> 04:20.434
least until I could build up
a cash reserve.

04:21.739 --> 04:23.393
And I believed him.

04:23.437 --> 04:26.918
I'd do anything to go
back and change things.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.964
But I can't.

04:30.661 --> 04:32.489
The truth is

04:32.533 --> 04:35.536
I was doing the best I could
with what I had.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.583
BULL:

04:39.627 --> 04:41.846

Ed's insurance company calling.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.634
Keep going.
I'll be right back. Hey.

04:46.677 --> 04:50.638
Good timing.
Our star witness is doing great.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.861
Those look nice. Do they
come in an open toe?

04:56.905 --> 04:58.385

They keep your feet warm

04:58.428 --> 04:59.951
at 30 below zero, so I doubt it.

04:59.995 --> 05:02.998
Does it get 30 below
on Kilimanjaro?

05:03.041 --> 05:04.956
You got to be ready
for anything.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.349
I can't believe
you are traveling

05:06.393 --> 05:08.351
halfway across the world
with a guy you just met.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.962
That's so... spontaneous.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.356
I can't believe you're
climbing a freaking mountain.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.706
Guy put a gun to my head,
and you know what he gave me?

05:15.750 --> 05:17.578
A dhi.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.364
A barely passing grade?

05:21.408 --> 05:24.628
In Sanskrit,
it's insight or intellect.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.021
In Hindu philosophy,

05:26.064 --> 05:29.546
it's a gut instinct
you can't ignore.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.334
Going with Cameron,
climbing Kilimanjaro,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.031
that's my dhi.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.642
I wish I had a dhi.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.515
I think I might have one.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.474
[knocking on door]Whoa, whoa, so that's it?

05:44.518 --> 05:46.607

our strategy?

challenges, and I...

05:58.445 --> 06:00.360
Ed Wilson's insurance company
is settling

06:00.403 --> 06:02.753
the carbon monoxide suit.
We could've won that.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.843
Yes, maybe.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.542
Ever heard of a firm
called Ellis & Clifton?

06:08.585 --> 06:11.022
These insurance company guys,
I'll tell you,

06:11.066 --> 06:13.721
they are classic cowards.

06:13.764 --> 06:16.724
They're afraid of any kind
of fight, any conflict.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.595
You're right, they're the worst.
Answer my question,

06:18.639 --> 06:20.684
and I will put a hit out
on them for you.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.512

06:38.789 --> 06:40.095
What are you thinking?

06:40.138 --> 06:42.706
Ellis & Clifton
has been freelancing

06:42.750 --> 06:43.881
their trial analysis work.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.056
I want to pitch them

06:45.100 --> 06:48.582
on making TAC
their exclusive provider.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.673
It's ambitious. I mean,
we're stretched pretty thin.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.718
I don't know if we could
even service them right now.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.198
We can if we reinvest

06:56.241 --> 06:58.418
the money from Smokestack Labs,
take on more staff,

06:58.461 --> 06:59.984
more office space.

07:00.028 --> 07:03.423
What makes you think
Ellis & Clifton would say yes?

07:03.466 --> 07:04.728
'Cause we're gonna show them

07:04.772 --> 07:07.557
how we can seriously improve
their win rate.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.995
Because you already have
the numbers that prove we can.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.868
Would I be sitting here
if I didn't?

07:14.912 --> 07:16.436
I like this idea.

07:16.479 --> 07:18.438
All right.
How do we get started?

07:18.481 --> 07:20.048
We have a problem.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.571
CHUNK:
Look, I think we're being

07:21.615 --> 07:22.746

in the office.

At least let him self-surrender.

09:28.263 --> 09:29.569
Yes. Ed is a good man

09:29.612 --> 09:31.701
caught in a perfect storm
of bad circumstances.

09:31.745 --> 09:36.010
Punishing him would
only pile tragedy upon tragedy.Right.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.230
You and I
need to start talking voir dire.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.623
It's set for Tuesday.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.233
No, I... That is the same day

09:42.277 --> 09:43.626
that we're having lunch
with Aurora Clifton.

09:43.670 --> 09:46.586
Who?Aurora Clifton
of Ellis & Clifton,

09:46.629 --> 09:48.631
the massive firm
that we're pitching.

09:48.675 --> 09:49.980
Oh, yeah.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.417
Sorry. That was
before Ed got dragged out

09:52.461 --> 09:54.637
of here in cuffs.
Let's reschedule.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.900
I begged for this meeting, Bull.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.773
Aurora is in town now
for a wrongful death trial.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.689
She made clear
her schedule is very tight.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.386
Oh.

10:04.429 --> 10:07.258
Well, fine. You do lunch.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.869
Without you?Sure.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.784
We're partners.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.830
We've got to learn
to divide and conquer sometime,

10:13.874 --> 10:16.267
especially
if we're planning to expand.

10:16.311 --> 10:19.053
No argument here.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.448
ED:
Dr. Bull. Mr. Palmer.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.928
BULL:
Oh.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.451
Hey, Ed. How
you holding up?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.540
Good. Good.

10:29.585 --> 10:30.934
Well, terrible, actually.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.632
I haven't been sleeping.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.982
Well, that's only natural, Ed.

10:35.025 --> 10:38.289
I spent all last night
researching jury selection,

10:38.333 --> 10:39.813
and I've got some ideas.

10:39.856 --> 10:40.944
CHUNK:
Okay. Um,

10:40.988 --> 10:42.685
well, thank you,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.905
but we've got
voir dire covered, Ed.

10:44.948 --> 10:48.648
I know you're the experts,
and I know this is annoying,

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
but when I'm anxious,

10:50.737 --> 10:53.783
it helps me to focus
on solving a problem.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.351
Well, fire away. The
more brains the better.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.049
I think it's really important
that we kick all the renters

10:59.093 --> 11:00.572
off my jury

11:00.616 --> 11:02.400
because they're predisposed
to dislike landlords.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.228
CHUNK: That's a good idea,
but in this city,

11:04.272 --> 11:05.708
70% of the people rent,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.797
so we can't get rid
of all of them.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.930
BULL: We're gonna be weeding
out people who are inclined

11:09.973 --> 11:11.714
to blame you for this tragedy.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.586
People who have
what we call a Bad Actor Bias.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.676
What's that?BULL: Well, it is
the belief that when

11:16.719 --> 11:18.678
terrible things happen,
someone has to be to blame,

11:18.721 --> 11:20.680
and that allows people to ignore

11:20.723 --> 11:23.465
the fact that
accidents can happen

11:23.508 --> 11:25.380
and ruin our lives
at any moment.

11:25.423 --> 11:26.729
So, how do we spot these people?

11:26.773 --> 11:28.252
It's easy.

11:28.296 --> 11:31.952
Mr. Palmer is gonna ask
them questions about blame.

11:31.995 --> 11:34.128
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I want to speak with you

11:34.171 --> 11:35.520
about blame.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.957
Oh, no.ROB:
About a week ago in Boston...

11:37.000 --> 11:39.089
Not good.Not good at all.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.004
What's not good?
What's happening?

11:41.048 --> 11:43.224
The prosecutor is
using our strategy.

11:43.267 --> 11:46.140
Except he wants to keep jurors
with Bad Actor Bias,

11:46.183 --> 11:48.272
and we want to eliminate them.ROB:
Juror number eight.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.318
Why do you think the car
swerved off the road?

11:50.361 --> 11:52.276
I bet the roads were slick.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.278
We've had a lot of rain.Ah.

11:54.322 --> 11:57.020
Your Honor, the People would
like to thank and excuse

11:57.064 --> 11:58.674
juror number eight.If we stick with our strategy,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.154
it's gonna be a
war of attrition

12:00.197 --> 12:01.677
until both sides
are out of strikes.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.158
Then we're just left
with who we get.

12:04.201 --> 12:05.376
We need to call an audible.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.900
What do you mean?

12:06.943 --> 12:08.684
Well, Rob's picks
are gonna blame you

12:08.728 --> 12:10.338
for the carbon monoxide
poisoning,

12:10.381 --> 12:13.167
but that doesn't mean they
can't find a little forgiveness.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.429
We're looking
for compassion.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.736
Okay, but I'm gonna need
some new questions.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.172
Like, now.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.000
Yeah. There aren't
any good questions.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.653
You ask somebody
if they're compassionate,

12:21.697 --> 12:23.090
they're only gonna lie.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.700
To make themselves look good.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.747
But we have
a secret weapon. Taylor?

12:27.790 --> 12:28.835
Scouring for compassion

12:28.878 --> 12:30.880
as we speak.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.795
Um, juror 11

12:32.839 --> 12:35.755
has Facebook posts
about donating to charity.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.192
Well, let's ignore that.
We don't know if she did it

12:38.235 --> 12:40.629
out of the goodness of her heart
or for the likes.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.544
Then what am I looking for?[Bull exhales]

12:42.587 --> 12:44.894
People who have survived things,

12:44.938 --> 12:47.767
things that others judge.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.291
Something that fosters empathy.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.293
Maybe someone
who's been fired for misconduct

12:52.336 --> 12:55.687
or an alcoholic
who's gotten sober.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.037
Got it.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.691
Juror number 15,

12:59.735 --> 13:01.128
what do you think was
the cause of this fire?

13:01.171 --> 13:03.173
Someone probably left
a cigarette burning.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.654
Or maybe a candle.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.874
People can be so reckless.

13:07.917 --> 13:11.181
Your Honor, this juror is
acceptable to the prosecution.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.705
Of course she is.
Taylor, any reason

13:13.749 --> 13:15.272
we don't kick this woman
to the curb?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.059
Actually,
she went bankrupt. Yay!

13:19.102 --> 13:20.800
Now I feel like an ass.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.931
STEINER:
Mr. Palmer?

13:23.063 --> 13:26.588
Uh, the defense has no objection
to this juror, Your Honor.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.242
Dr. Bull is sorry
he isn't able to be here.

13:28.285 --> 13:31.027
One of our cases
just became a five-alarm fire,

13:31.071 --> 13:32.899
and our clients
always come first.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.726
I'm sure you understand.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.076
I'm in the middle of trial.

13:36.119 --> 13:39.079
I don't have time
to have this conversation twice.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.908
Let's reschedule down the road
when all parties can join.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.997
2002.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.347
You worked for Cooper
Ellis & Associates

13:46.390 --> 13:47.914
as a senior associate.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.830
Then along came the biggest
copyright case in a decade,

13:50.873 --> 13:54.137
and Mr. Ellis asked you
to second chair.

13:54.181 --> 13:56.748
Ms. Morgan, while I admire that
you've done your research...

13:56.792 --> 13:58.272
Except halfway through trial,

13:58.315 --> 14:00.056
your boss
suffered a heart attack.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.928
I'm guessing at that point,

14:01.971 --> 14:03.190
the client wanted a mistrial,

14:03.233 --> 14:04.931
and the judge
surely would've granted it.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.281
But somehow
you convinced the client

14:07.324 --> 14:09.109
that you didn't need Mr. Ellis

14:09.152 --> 14:11.633
and went on
to win that case alone.

14:11.676 --> 14:12.939
One year later,

14:12.982 --> 14:16.159
the firm was renamed
Ellis & Clifton.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.900
Your point?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.642
If both partners
are the best of the best,

14:20.685 --> 14:23.863
sometimes you only need one
to get it done.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.216
Shall we order some apps?

14:29.259 --> 14:31.653
Miss?

14:31.696 --> 14:35.091
Okay, Taylor, what do we know
about these last two candidates?

14:35.135 --> 14:38.094
[phone ringing]Uh, hold on a second, Bull.

14:38.138 --> 14:39.879
Mauricio's school is calling.

14:39.922 --> 14:42.229
Hello. This is Taylor Rentzel.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.971
Oh, my God. What happened?

14:45.014 --> 14:46.320
Of course. I'm on my way.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.148
Bull, I have to go.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.715
Right now? We only have
one juror left to seat.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.065
Mauricio got hurt.
He's on his way

14:52.108 --> 14:53.936
to the emergency room.
I have to go. I'm sorry.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.155
[sighs]
Taylor's gone.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.418
Mr. Palmer, it's your turn.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.854
Uh...

15:00.987 --> 15:02.989
I need a question
that gets us to compassion.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.251
There aren't any good questions.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.948
Come on, Bull.STEINER:
Mr. Palmer,

15:05.992 --> 15:07.994
I'd like to wrap this up today.CHUNK:
Uh,

15:08.037 --> 15:10.866
y-yes, Your Honor.
Just one moment, please.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.694
Come on,
there's got to be something.

15:12.737 --> 15:14.348
I mean...There is.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.132
But you're not gonna like it.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.133
What?

15:17.177 --> 15:18.178
Sorry.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.136
What? Ow. Hey!

15:21.137 --> 15:22.922
Bull!

15:22.965 --> 15:24.445
Check juror 26.What?

15:24.488 --> 15:26.099
Juror 26. He feels

15:26.142 --> 15:27.404
real bad for you.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.452
Your Honor, uh,

15:31.495 --> 15:35.282
juror 26 is acceptable
to the defense.

15:35.325 --> 15:36.936
Well-played in there.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.938
I mean, mostly for Bull.
And your client.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.070
You may have gotten the
soggy end of that stick.You think?

15:41.114 --> 15:43.594
Listen, you got a decent jury.
That's all that matters.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.987
This might stain.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.554
I never liked
that shirt anyway.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.686
You said
you loved this shirt.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.036
Oh, I was lying.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.994
This may actually be
an improvement.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.214
Shut up.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.956
MARISSA:
With every case

15:56.999 --> 15:59.523
we try, every mirror
jury we analyze,

15:59.567 --> 16:01.395
we continue to refine

16:01.438 --> 16:02.918
our algorithm.
You and your clients

16:02.962 --> 16:05.312
will get the benefit
of the 13 years

16:05.355 --> 16:09.403
that we have spent perfecting
our predictive behavior models.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.405
I'm impressed
by TAC's track record.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
You're clearly doing
something right.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.712
My next meeting is here.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.671
You've given me a lot
to think about, Marissa.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.977
I'll be in touch.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.631
Thank you.
Looking forward to it.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.807
Bradley.Marissa.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.767
Aurora, it's so nice
to meet you in person.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.464
How do you two...?

16:27.508 --> 16:28.248
AURORA:
I called Bradley

16:28.291 --> 16:29.031
to do my due diligence.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.685
After he raved about you,

16:30.728 --> 16:32.556
he mentioned
that he recently launched

16:32.600 --> 16:34.645
his own trial science division.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
Really? Since when?

16:37.257 --> 16:39.041
Well, I got my algorithm
up and running

16:39.085 --> 16:40.738
shortly after you
left the firm.

16:40.782 --> 16:42.740
Actually, well,

16:42.784 --> 16:45.047
it would be fair to say
that you inspired me.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.919
I bet I did.

16:47.963 --> 16:50.226
Well, I decided I might as well
hear from both of you

16:50.270 --> 16:51.706
while I'm in town.

16:51.749 --> 16:55.014
Of course. Super. Well...

16:55.057 --> 16:57.320
May the best firm win.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.767
Mauricio had to get
eight stitches.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.726
It was awful.
He was so upset,

17:11.769 --> 17:13.075
I thought I'd never
get him to calm down.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.338
What happened?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.601
Some kid pushed him
off the monkey bars.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.126
Oh, my God.
What a little monster.

17:20.169 --> 17:21.649
Yeah. I don't know, maybe.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.304
I mean, turns out
Mauricio started the fight.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.870
Oh.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.089
I know.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.352
He's been acting out a bit
since Erik left.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.093
That's a big transition.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.269
I'm sure
he'll settle down in time.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.750
[exhales]
Hope you're right.

17:35.793 --> 17:37.273
I have a conference later
with his teacher

17:37.317 --> 17:39.101
to discuss "the incident."

17:39.145 --> 17:40.407
Can't wait.

17:41.669 --> 17:42.757
So...Mm.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.237
How do you think
Bradley Lena

17:44.280 --> 17:46.152
got his own jury algorithm
up and running so quickly?

17:46.195 --> 17:47.979
Simple. He looked
under the hood of mine

17:48.023 --> 17:49.416
while we were
working together.

17:49.459 --> 17:53.289
Hired engineers to scrape
together a cheap imitation.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.769
So he stole it from you?

17:54.812 --> 17:56.640
Well, legally, no.

17:56.684 --> 17:59.034
In reality, yes.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.906
Okay, he has an algorithm.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.821
But does he know
how to interpret the results?

18:03.865 --> 18:06.041
I mean, you've been doing this
for years.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.217
He's just getting started.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.654
What Bradley lacks
in experience and morals

18:10.698 --> 18:12.830
he more than makes up for
in salesmanship.

18:12.874 --> 18:16.007
He will have Aurora eating
out of the palm of his hand.

18:16.051 --> 18:18.314
So, he's a smooth talker.

18:18.358 --> 18:21.404
But you know what they say.
Actions speak louder than words.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.147
You're right. Great idea.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.108
What idea?

18:29.151 --> 18:31.806
JOSH:
The beeping sound woke me up.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.112
I felt

18:33.155 --> 18:34.591
so sick.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.332
[voice breaking]: I knew
something was really wrong.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.074
I wanted to get Julie, my wife,
out of the building,

18:39.118 --> 18:42.382
but before I could...

18:44.775 --> 18:46.777
...I passed out.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.000
[crying]:
I couldn't save her.

18:52.043 --> 18:55.264
Josh, your wife's death
is not your fault.

18:55.308 --> 18:57.353
Okay, I know this must be
incredibly difficult for you.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.833
If you want to take a second,

18:58.876 --> 19:00.704
just...I'm fine.

19:00.748 --> 19:02.489
[sniffles]

19:03.664 --> 19:05.753
Do you know the name
Nicholas Borrego?

19:06.797 --> 19:10.366
Sure. He was the maintenance man
for our apartment building.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.238
The maintenance man
that the defendant used

19:12.281 --> 19:13.891
to repair the boiler.

19:13.935 --> 19:17.068
Did you have any memorable
interactions with Mr. Borrego?

19:17.112 --> 19:19.114
Two months
before the carbon monoxide leak,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.116
he came to fix
the garbage disposal.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.945
I smelled alcohol on his breath.

19:23.988 --> 19:26.252
ROB:
He was drunk?JOSH: Yeah.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.471
He was slurring his words,
and he dropped his tools

19:28.515 --> 19:29.777
a few times.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.996
Uh, can you think of any reason

19:32.040 --> 19:34.216
why the defendant
would have fired

19:34.260 --> 19:35.870
his previous maintenance company

19:35.913 --> 19:37.828
even though they had
an impeccable service record

19:37.872 --> 19:39.743
and-and replaced them
with this man

19:39.787 --> 19:41.354
who drank on the job?CHUNK:
Objection.

19:41.397 --> 19:43.094
This witness cannot testify

19:43.138 --> 19:45.488
to my client's state of mind
or decision-making,

19:45.532 --> 19:47.360
Your Honor.ROB:
Your Honor, the witness has

19:47.403 --> 19:50.754
direct knowledge of the subject
from the deceased.

19:50.798 --> 19:51.973
Overruled.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.366
The witness
may answer the question.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.805
Nicholas said
that he and Ed were old friends

19:57.848 --> 20:00.764
and that Ed owed him one.ED: No.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.288
[whispers]: That's wrong.Not here, Ed.

20:02.331 --> 20:05.813
But it wasn't how
he's making it seem.I said not here.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.989
And now your wife

20:08.032 --> 20:10.470
and five other people are dead?

20:11.514 --> 20:14.474
No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.913
BULL: Why didn't you
tell me you had a history

20:18.956 --> 20:19.957
with your maintenance guy?

20:20.001 --> 20:21.176
ED:
I hired Nicholas

20:21.220 --> 20:22.438
because he'd worked
for me before

20:22.482 --> 20:23.787
when I was a contractor.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.311
Yeah, I owed him a solid,

20:25.354 --> 20:27.138
but we weren't friends.

20:27.182 --> 20:28.966
He was qualified and licensed.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.968
No, he was drinking
on the job.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.970
That man's wife called
with problems

20:33.014 --> 20:34.145
at all hours of the night.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.452
Wasn't he ever allowed
to have a few beers?

20:36.496 --> 20:38.149
This...

20:38.193 --> 20:39.934
This is really bad,
isn't it?

20:41.196 --> 20:42.371
It certainly didn't help.

20:42.415 --> 20:44.199
We're gonna lose.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.854
I'm gonna go to prison.Hey, Ed.

20:46.897 --> 20:48.856
We're not there yet.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.292
We're gonna get
an HVAC expert

20:50.336 --> 20:52.990
to testify how qualified
Nick was to do his job,

20:53.034 --> 20:55.558
and we're gonna get
experts to back him up.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.212
In fact, we're gonna
parade so many experts

20:57.256 --> 20:59.867
through that courtroom,
the jury is gonna be sick

20:59.910 --> 21:02.261
of hearing how
qualified Nicholas was.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.089
Okay.

21:06.090 --> 21:07.353
Okay.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.094
I know that what
Mauricio did was wrong,

21:10.138 --> 21:13.010
and believe me, I've had a
long talk with him about it.

21:13.054 --> 21:16.057
But he's been having a
really hard time lately.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.494
My ex-husband recently
moved to Hawaii...

21:18.538 --> 21:20.366
Ms. Rentzel....and he and Mauricio
are really close.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.932
And they speak on
Zoom every night,

21:21.976 --> 21:24.239
but it's not the same
as having him here.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.024
Ms. Rentzel, I do not believe
what's going on with Mauricio

21:27.068 --> 21:29.462
is because his father
moved away.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.507
You don't?No.

21:31.551 --> 21:35.250
Although I think it's possible
that his absence

21:35.294 --> 21:39.080
is revealing
some other preexisting issues.

21:40.647 --> 21:43.040
Issues? What-what issues?

21:43.084 --> 21:45.347
Lack of focus,
trouble finishing tasks,

21:45.391 --> 21:47.044
waiting his turn.

21:47.088 --> 21:49.525
He's a little kid.
That's only natural.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.571
I spend all day
with little kids.

21:51.614 --> 21:56.053
What I'm talking about
is outside normal.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.490
[chuckles]

21:57.533 --> 21:59.274
What does that mean?

22:00.275 --> 22:04.061
I think Mauricio may have ADHD.

22:05.062 --> 22:07.195
No. He just has a lot of energy.

22:07.238 --> 22:10.241
I know some people feel
there's a stigma to ADHD,

22:10.285 --> 22:11.895
but there's nothing...It's not about a stigma.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.202
It's... I just don't think...

22:14.245 --> 22:16.291
[chuckles]:
I mean, you're not a doctor.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.901
I know.

22:17.945 --> 22:19.250
I'm telling you this

22:19.294 --> 22:21.644
so you can have your son
evaluated by one.

22:21.688 --> 22:25.692
This isn't something you want
to ignore, Ms. Rentzel.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.565
BRADLEY:
In these situations,

22:29.609 --> 22:31.915
live feedback
from our parallel jurors

22:31.959 --> 22:34.135
will offer insights
that you and your clients

22:34.178 --> 22:36.093
can use to adjust
defense strategy on the fly.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.618
Hi. I'm so sorry
for the interruption.

22:38.661 --> 22:41.316
Oh, Marissa, I'm not scheduled
to hear from you until tomorrow.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.926
Unfortunately,
what I have to say can't wait.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.493
I'm sure Bradley
will understand.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.408
We'll just be
a few more minutes, Marissa.It's about

22:46.452 --> 22:48.149
your wrongful death trial.

22:48.192 --> 22:49.237
What about it?MARISSA:
I know

22:49.280 --> 22:50.281
that you're expecting

22:50.325 --> 22:51.457
a verdict soon.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.936
The jury is deliberating now.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.024
I also know the other side

22:54.068 --> 22:56.070
has a settlement offer
on the table

22:56.113 --> 22:57.245
for $20 million.

22:57.288 --> 23:00.422
I am here to tell you
to take that deal.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.945
Why would I do that?MARISSA:
Because I

23:01.989 --> 23:04.905
spent all night
running mock trials of the case.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.341
What kind of stunt is this?

23:06.385 --> 23:08.691
And the upshot is
you are going to lose.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.954
We feel very good
about this jury.I'm sorry,

23:10.998 --> 23:13.304
but you're going to lose,
and the jury

23:13.348 --> 23:15.524
is going to award
much higher damages

23:15.568 --> 23:17.439
than even
your worst-case scenario.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.963
$45 million to $50 million.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.444
No. I prepped this case myself.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.969
If we lose, and we won't,
there's no way we lose that big.

23:26.013 --> 23:27.536
I wish I were wrong,

23:27.580 --> 23:30.452
but our mirror juries
are exceptionally accurate.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.412
You can still minimize
your losses.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.197
[phone vibrating]

23:36.240 --> 23:38.460
Too late. This is the verdict.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.636
Let's see if you're
as good as you think you are.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.290
Yes, Craig.

23:42.333 --> 23:44.205
[clears throat]

23:47.382 --> 23:49.210
MARISSA:
$47 million in damages.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.690
Right on the money.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.519
Aurora said our deal
is as good as done.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.173
She wants to come by TAC
later this week

23:56.217 --> 23:57.653
to see how the sausage is made.

23:57.697 --> 23:58.741
[Bull chuckles]

23:58.785 --> 24:00.221
Well, congratulations.

24:00.264 --> 24:03.485
You just single-handedly
tripled TAC's business.

24:03.529 --> 24:07.010
The look on Bradley's face
was priceless.

24:07.054 --> 24:08.751
Well, we will celebrate
when this case is over,

24:08.795 --> 24:10.623
all right? I got to go.MARISSA: Bye.

24:11.711 --> 24:13.190
Hey there.DEAN:
How you doing?

24:13.234 --> 24:16.411
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.
This is Chester Palmer.Hey.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.195
Are you positive
that it's safe to be down here?

24:18.239 --> 24:20.284
I mean, the tenants have been
in a hotel for the last week.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.417
Uh, city does that out of
an abundance of caution.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.114
Yeah. But don't worry.

24:24.158 --> 24:25.420
This thing's been
shut down for a while.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.726
What are we looking at here?

24:26.769 --> 24:28.249
When it comes
to the boiler,

24:28.292 --> 24:29.685
pretty open-and-shut.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.208
Can see the exhaust pipe cracked

24:31.252 --> 24:32.514
in the area
that it was oxidized.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.342
Then it was mended
with furnace cement

24:34.385 --> 24:35.474
and duct tape.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.562
Is that
a reasonable repair?

24:36.605 --> 24:38.389
Yeah, sure. Happens
all the time.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.130
Your maintenance man
did a solid job.

24:40.174 --> 24:42.698
You know, much better than a lot
of the shoddy work I see.

24:42.742 --> 24:45.266
But there was
something strange.

24:45.309 --> 24:46.746
The second CO started leaking,

24:46.789 --> 24:50.140
this emergency damper here,
that should've shut off,

24:50.184 --> 24:52.229
triggered the whole system.
Shut it down.

24:52.273 --> 24:55.102
The first expert we talked to
said it didn't trigger

24:55.145 --> 24:56.799
because a wire was severed.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.758
He thought maybe rats
chewed through it?

24:58.801 --> 25:01.282
He's right about the wire,
but...

25:02.762 --> 25:04.241
Not rats.

25:04.285 --> 25:06.417
Rats never eat just one wire.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.984
They eat everything.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.725
And the rest
of the wiring's intact.

25:09.769 --> 25:12.336
Then how do you explain that?To me,

25:12.380 --> 25:14.556
looks like somebody snipped it

25:14.600 --> 25:16.602
with wire cutters.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.561
Rob's been going after the
wrong guy this whole time.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.563
Ed wasn't negligent.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.522
Somebody murdered
those people.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.530
Sorry. Pass.

25:31.573 --> 25:32.922
What do you mean, pass?

25:32.966 --> 25:35.272
I'm not dropping the charges
against your client.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.231
Come on, Rob.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.189
Ed's boiler
was deliberately sabotaged.

25:39.233 --> 25:42.410
This is a sworn affidavit
by experts...That's

25:42.453 --> 25:44.455
one person's opinion.We will find others
to back him up.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.631
I'm sure you will.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.546
But your original expert
doesn't agree.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.591
Otherwise, you would've come
to me with this weeks ago.

25:49.635 --> 25:50.810
CHUNK:But even if you're
not convinced,

25:50.853 --> 25:52.246
you still have an obligation

25:52.289 --> 25:53.552
to investigate this further.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.118
This is a man's life, Rob.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.642
You don't have the monopoly
on giving a crap

25:56.685 --> 25:57.817
about other people, Chester.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.819
I just happen to disagree
with you

25:59.862 --> 26:02.386
on the facts.How are you so stubborn?

26:03.474 --> 26:05.302
If there's nothing else
I can help you boys with...

26:05.346 --> 26:07.609
It's called confirmation bias.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.264
You made your case in the press
every chance you got,

26:10.307 --> 26:11.482
and now you can't admit
you're wrong

26:11.526 --> 26:13.310
without getting egg
all over your face.

26:13.354 --> 26:15.399
Do I use the media
to help sell my case?

26:15.443 --> 26:17.227
You bet your ass.
You want to know why?

26:17.271 --> 26:18.620
CHUNK:
Weak case?

26:18.664 --> 26:20.579
Flexible ethics?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.929
Because in the courtroom,
you have a team of people

26:22.972 --> 26:25.758
whispering in your ear, digging
through jurors' digital lives,

26:25.801 --> 26:28.717
their trash,
psychoanalyzing every fart.

26:28.761 --> 26:32.068
Whoa. I don't think
we're that sophisticated.Yeah. You both

26:32.112 --> 26:33.983
like to preach about ethics,
but TAC is turning

26:34.027 --> 26:35.898
the system I love
into an arms race.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.073
We're done here.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.122
BULL:
We're throwing out
the old strategy.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.952
Now that we have shown our hand,

26:45.995 --> 26:47.693
Rob is gonna double down

26:47.736 --> 26:49.738
with his character assassination
of Ed,

26:49.782 --> 26:51.392
and we're gonna take advantage
of that.

26:51.435 --> 26:54.047
Instead of arguing that Ed is
a nice guy who made a mistake,

26:54.090 --> 26:55.657
I'll concede to the court

26:55.701 --> 26:57.572
that there were tenants
who disliked him.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.182
Hated him, even.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.489
And I'm gonna convince that jury
that one of those tenants

27:01.532 --> 27:04.100
sabotaged that boiler
to settle a score.MARISSA: That will resonate

27:04.144 --> 27:05.798
with the jurors
who have a Bad Actor Bias,

27:05.841 --> 27:07.843
but only if we have specifics.

27:07.887 --> 27:11.194
They'll want a bigger bad
to replace Ed.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.762
Danny,
any of the tenants have a gripe

27:13.806 --> 27:16.547
that could've motivated
the sabotage of the boiler?

27:16.591 --> 27:18.898
Yeah, maybe this woman,
Kristi Walker.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.203
A few tenants

27:20.247 --> 27:23.076
remembered her having
a screaming match with Ed

27:23.119 --> 27:24.730
shortly before the leak.
Plus, she wasn't there

27:24.773 --> 27:25.861
the night it happened,
and she hasn't

27:25.905 --> 27:27.036
returned any of my calls.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.647
Kristi has a record
for possession.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.257
She's also the only tenant

27:30.300 --> 27:32.172
that hasn't checked into the
free hotel provided by the city.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.827
Maybe she's making herself
scarce for a reason.

27:34.870 --> 27:37.699
Okay. You two

27:37.743 --> 27:39.048
find Kristi.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.876
If she did it,
maybe we can get her to trip up

27:40.920 --> 27:42.530
and confess.

27:42.573 --> 27:44.010
I have no family,

27:44.053 --> 27:47.187
so I put all my time and energy
into my building.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.232
Maybe it sounds corny,

27:49.276 --> 27:52.583
but I think of my tenants
as family.

27:52.627 --> 27:56.239
The fact that this
happened under my roof...

27:58.241 --> 27:59.808
[voice breaking]:
I'm devastated.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.724
They're surprised
by how much they like him.

28:02.768 --> 28:05.509
Things are looking up
on our end.CHUNK: Ed, I want to talk to you

28:05.553 --> 28:07.468
about one tenant in particular:

28:07.511 --> 28:09.862
Kristi Walker.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.865
Now, shortly before the leak,
the two of you had an argument.

28:12.908 --> 28:15.171
Do you recall
what that argument was about?

28:15.215 --> 28:18.218
Sure. Uh,
she was behind on her rent,

28:18.261 --> 28:20.176
and I told her
I was gonna have to start

28:20.220 --> 28:22.004
the process of evicting her.

28:22.048 --> 28:24.615
And how did she take that?Not well.

28:24.659 --> 28:28.010
She screamed at me
that she had nowhere else to go.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.883
I felt bad,
but I'd already let it slide

28:30.926 --> 28:33.276
for months
beyond what I was required to

28:33.320 --> 28:34.974
by the rent forbearance.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.193
She sounds
like a desperate woman.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.587
You think that that's
a fair characterization

28:39.630 --> 28:41.589
from your experience with her?

28:41.632 --> 28:43.983
It's not nice to say, but yeah.

28:44.026 --> 28:46.072
She had a lot of problems.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.683
Drugs, trouble with the cops.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.293
Hypothetically, if...

28:50.337 --> 28:52.078
if a tenant like Kristi Walker

28:52.121 --> 28:55.342
wanted to stop
the eviction process

28:55.385 --> 28:56.909
while continuing to live
in your building

28:56.952 --> 28:58.345
without paying rent,

28:58.388 --> 29:00.869
is there a situation
that would make that possible?

29:00.913 --> 29:02.915
ED:
Yes. In New York City,

29:02.958 --> 29:05.613
there's a law that allows
tenants to withhold rent

29:05.656 --> 29:07.789
if they don't have
adequate heat.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.139
And what provides heat
for your building?

29:10.183 --> 29:11.750
The boiler.

29:11.793 --> 29:14.274
The same boiler
that experts testified

29:14.317 --> 29:16.232
had been
intentionally sabotaged?

29:16.276 --> 29:17.277
That's correct.

29:17.320 --> 29:18.931
CHUNK:
So, anyone

29:18.974 --> 29:21.107
could gain access
to that boiler room

29:21.150 --> 29:22.804
and cut that wire?

29:22.848 --> 29:25.111
The door to the boiler room
wasn't kept locked.

29:25.154 --> 29:28.636
Anybody could have gotten
inside there if they wanted to.

29:28.679 --> 29:30.029
Including Kristi Walker,

29:30.072 --> 29:31.900
a desperate,
drug-addicted woman...

29:31.944 --> 29:33.902
Objection! Inflammatory....who was about
to be evicted

29:33.946 --> 29:35.817
with nowhere else to go?

29:35.861 --> 29:37.384
And that
is definitely speculation.

29:37.427 --> 29:38.907
Sustained.
You are well out of bounds,

29:38.951 --> 29:40.169
Mr. Palmer, and you know it.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.172
My apologies, Your Honor.
I withdraw.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.218
No further questions.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.657
Okay, that went well.

29:49.700 --> 29:52.007
Any update on finding Kristi
to bring this home?

29:52.051 --> 29:53.313
I just got her phone's
last known location.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.968
Danny's on her way now.With a board this green,

29:56.011 --> 29:57.447
we might not even need her.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.971
BULL:
Never hurts to put a cherry
on the sundae.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.973
[phone chimes]

30:02.975 --> 30:05.151
Aurora Clifton
is on her way up.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.848
Excuse me.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.980
[elevator dings]

30:09.068 --> 30:11.722
Aurora, welcome to TAC.
Let's start the tour

30:11.766 --> 30:13.724
in our state-of-the-art
mock courtroom.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.857
Actually, uh,
I'm gonna stop you.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.033
There's no need for the tour.Why not?

30:18.077 --> 30:20.166
You put a lot of effort
into pitching me,

30:20.209 --> 30:22.995
so I thought I owed it to you
to tell you in person.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.866
I'm hiring Bradley Lena

30:24.910 --> 30:26.868
to handle
our trial science needs.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.870
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.786
Bradley told me that
you left TAC to join his firm

30:31.830 --> 30:33.353
and then abruptly went back
to TAC.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.703
I can't trust some
of the most important part

30:35.746 --> 30:37.183
of my business
to someone who's flaky.

30:37.226 --> 30:40.099
Flaky? I didn't leave Bradley
because I'm flaky.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.362
I left because
I didn't want to partner

30:42.405 --> 30:44.233
with someone
as unethical as he is.

30:44.277 --> 30:48.107
Case in point, that man
stole his algorithm from me.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.891
So? That's good business.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.893
Question is
why you'd let someone

30:51.937 --> 30:53.373
steal your most valuable asset.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.419
Aurora, let's sit down, talk
this through. You will see

30:56.463 --> 30:58.160
that partnering with TAC
is better business.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.207
Marissa, you're a smart woman,
but you let yourself get played.

31:01.250 --> 31:03.209
I can't have weakness
on my team.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.994
I need killers,
and Bradley's a killer.[elevator dings]

31:06.038 --> 31:08.127
[elevator doors open]

31:10.956 --> 31:12.000
Good luck.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.104
DANNY:
Excuse me. Kristi?

31:29.148 --> 31:30.758
Who the hell are you?

31:30.801 --> 31:32.891
Sorry to startle you.
I'm an investigator

31:32.934 --> 31:34.936
looking into
the carbon monoxide incident

31:34.980 --> 31:36.285
at your apartment building.Leave me alone.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.461
DANNY:
I just want to talk.I said get lost.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.507
Or I could tell the
security guard over there

31:40.550 --> 31:41.987
to check your pockets.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.338
Just have a few questions.

31:45.381 --> 31:48.080
Help me out, and I'll pay for
whatever's in your jacket. Deal?

31:49.124 --> 31:50.212
What do you want?

31:50.256 --> 31:51.257
I think you know
what really happened

31:51.300 --> 31:52.780
in your apartment building.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.216
I don't want to get involved.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.783
I'm sure you didn't mean

31:55.826 --> 31:56.958
to hurt anyone.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.960
What are you talking about?

31:59.004 --> 32:00.788
You broke the boiler,
didn't you?

32:00.831 --> 32:02.790
What? No. I didn't...
I didn't break that boiler.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.009
Come on. You got
in a fight with Ed.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.401
You tried to get out
of paying your rent.

32:05.445 --> 32:06.794
Things didn't go
the way you thought they would.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.101
No. I-I yelled at Ed,
but then Nicholas,

32:09.144 --> 32:11.233
he warned me not to get
on Ed's bad side,

32:11.277 --> 32:14.236
and so I dropped it.
I-I didn't break that boiler.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.803
Wait, wait, wait.
The maintenance guy

32:15.846 --> 32:17.196
told you not to get
on Ed's bad side?

32:17.239 --> 32:18.501
Why?

32:19.589 --> 32:22.462
Because he said he knew things
about Ed. Scary things.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.159
That's how he got his job
and a place to live,

32:24.203 --> 32:26.466
by blackmailing him.
And then Nicholas warned me,

32:26.509 --> 32:28.337
and now he's dead.So, you think

32:28.381 --> 32:30.383
Ed leaked poison
in his own building

32:30.426 --> 32:32.820
just to silence Nicholas?

32:32.863 --> 32:34.169
Yeah.
Now you can arrest him, right?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.518
Aren't you a cop?

32:35.562 --> 32:37.172
I said I was an investigator.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.958
Wait, who do you work for?

32:40.001 --> 32:41.829
Oh, my God.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.179
You work for Ed.Kristi, wait.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.311
[alarm blaring]Hey, hey!

32:45.354 --> 32:47.313
Kristi, wait!Hey, empty your pockets!

32:47.356 --> 32:48.488
Damn it.

32:54.015 --> 32:55.974
Let me get this straight.
Ed isn't guilty

32:56.017 --> 32:57.149
of negligent homicide.

32:57.192 --> 32:59.978
He's guilty of mass murder?

33:01.066 --> 33:02.937
I'm just telling you
what Kristi said.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.809
Even if Nicholas had dirt on Ed
and Ed wanted him dead,

33:05.853 --> 33:07.986
a carbon monoxide leak

33:08.029 --> 33:10.205
doesn't sound
like the smartest plan to me.

33:10.249 --> 33:13.426
Nicholas's apartment was
directly above the boiler room.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.819
If anyone was gonna die,
it was gonna be him.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.430
Well, sure,
but five innocent people

33:17.473 --> 33:18.822
were killed in the process.

33:18.866 --> 33:21.912
If Ed's okay with that,
he's a monster.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.827
Kristi Walker has a long history
of drug abuse

33:23.871 --> 33:27.135
and every reason in the world
to want to deflect blame.

33:27.179 --> 33:30.356
True, but I saw real fear
in her face.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.314
Fear of going to prison,
Danny.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.489
Maybe.

33:33.533 --> 33:35.317
Well, Bull,
did you get any sense

33:35.361 --> 33:38.016
that Ed is capable
of something like that?

33:38.059 --> 33:39.843
No. Not at all.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.845
I mean, guy's a nervous wreck

33:41.889 --> 33:44.979
and seems to be showing
genuine empathy for the victims.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.503
I just don't see a sociopath.
I'm sorry.

33:47.547 --> 33:50.115
So, what do we do
about Kristi's story?

33:50.158 --> 33:53.161
Nothing.
Our job is to defend Ed.

33:53.205 --> 33:56.425
Digging any further
risks damaging him.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.037
So we rest our case.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.864
And don't tell
Chunk about this.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.866
He's got to sell that
closing argument tomorrow,

34:02.910 --> 34:06.174
and I don't want him
having any doubts about Ed.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.046
CHUNK:
Multiple experts

34:08.089 --> 34:11.440
confirmed that someone
cut that wire.

34:11.484 --> 34:15.227
Someone deliberately sabotaged
the boiler in Ed's building.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.882
That wasn't negligence.
That was a deliberate act.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.928
And yet the prosecution chooses

34:20.971 --> 34:23.322
to ignore this fact
and persecute

34:23.365 --> 34:24.975
an innocent man.

34:25.976 --> 34:28.588
Ed Wilson is a kind,

34:28.631 --> 34:32.896
responsible,
hardworking man.

34:32.940 --> 34:36.248
Ed already lost so much.

34:36.291 --> 34:39.468
You must not allow
the prosecution

34:39.512 --> 34:42.602
to take away anything more
from this man.

34:42.645 --> 34:46.258
You must find him innocent.

34:50.262 --> 34:51.611
Dr. Bull.

34:53.395 --> 34:56.398
Thanks so much
for everything.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.444
If the jury breaks my way,
I know you're the guy

34:58.487 --> 35:00.098
who kept me out of prison.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.408
Of course. You're welcome.

35:07.975 --> 35:10.282
Do you mind
if I ask you a question?

35:10.325 --> 35:14.677
Um, you said
that you owed Nicholas a favor.

35:14.721 --> 35:16.984
What do you mean?

35:17.027 --> 35:18.942
The other day, you said--
how'd you put it?--

35:18.986 --> 35:20.944
that you owed Nicholas a solid.

35:20.988 --> 35:22.511
And, if you don't mind,

35:22.555 --> 35:24.948
I was just wondering,
what was that?

35:24.992 --> 35:26.994
Oh. Uh...

35:27.037 --> 35:29.953
Well, back when I was working
job-to-job as a contractor,

35:29.997 --> 35:34.088
Nicholas hooked me up with a big
kitchen renovation project.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.481
Why?

35:35.524 --> 35:37.004
Does this have anything

35:37.047 --> 35:39.006
to do with my case?No.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.574
I'm just a curious man.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.971
There's a lot to do fast.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.625
You'll have to come to Chicago
and meet

35:49.669 --> 35:51.627
Cooper Ellis, get up to speed
on our current caseload.

35:51.671 --> 35:54.369
I will get on a plane tonight
if you want.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.544
[chuckles]

35:55.588 --> 35:57.155
A bottle
of Château Réserve de Loire

35:57.198 --> 35:59.505
compliments of the lady
at the bar.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.292
[chuckles softly]Oh.

36:04.336 --> 36:05.902
Let me.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.383
Marissa, how kind of you.

36:08.427 --> 36:11.995
I didn't want you to think that
there were any hard feelings.

36:12.039 --> 36:14.563
All's fair in love
and war, right?

36:14.607 --> 36:16.086
Right.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.002
Congratulations, by the way.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.091
You stole my algorithm,

36:21.135 --> 36:22.658
my job.

36:22.702 --> 36:25.357
But I won the real prize.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.359
What's that supposed to mean?

36:27.402 --> 36:29.578
I met with Matthew Price,

36:29.622 --> 36:32.320
the general counsel
for Wellman Hospitality.

36:32.364 --> 36:36.019
Showed him my mock trial results
for the wrongful death case.

36:36.063 --> 36:39.371
He was so angry that they paid
double what they would have

36:39.414 --> 36:41.460
if they'd settled, he
decided right then and there

36:41.503 --> 36:45.681
to fire Ellis & Clifton
and hire TAC instead.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.248
[chuckles]:
Oh, look.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.250
Aurora must be getting the news
right now.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.121
That's fun.

36:53.298 --> 36:55.256
That's her biggest client.I know.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.258
Enjoy your new partnership.

36:57.302 --> 37:00.130
Could I get another bottle
of champagne, please? To go?

37:00.174 --> 37:02.350
The good stuff this time.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.135
Erik, I'm worried, too.

37:05.179 --> 37:07.660
I'm the one
who's here dealing with it.

37:07.703 --> 37:10.402
That's not what I meant.
Look, the doctor said

37:10.445 --> 37:12.055
if we want to help Mauricio
without meds,

37:12.099 --> 37:14.362
it's gonna take
a lot more time and focus.

37:14.406 --> 37:16.364
Tutors, making sure
he's getting exercise

37:16.408 --> 37:18.714
before school in the morning.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.543
Maybe I can cut back
on my hours at work.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.328
I don't know.

37:23.371 --> 37:24.503
[cork pops]

37:24.546 --> 37:26.548
For the woman of the hour.Thanks.

37:26.592 --> 37:28.376
Hope you're ready for
a boatload of work.[chuckles]

37:28.420 --> 37:29.464
Bring it on.[chuckles]

37:30.509 --> 37:32.162
Oh, Taylor,
we're celebrating.

37:32.206 --> 37:34.164
Have a glass of bubbly.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.297
Um, by the way,
I'm gonna need you

37:36.341 --> 37:38.734
to start vetting
some new cyber analysts.[drink pours]

37:38.778 --> 37:41.389
Bull and I want you
to manage a team.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.783
Manage a team?MARISSA:
It's a lot more responsibility,

37:43.826 --> 37:45.263
but I promise you, it comes

37:45.306 --> 37:47.395
with a bigger paycheck, too.CHUNK:
Ka-ching.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.267
[Marissa and Chunk chuckle]

37:50.311 --> 37:52.574
KRISTI:
Because he said he knew things
about Ed. Scary things.

37:52.618 --> 37:53.793
That's how he got his job

37:53.836 --> 37:55.534
and a place to live,
by blackmailing him.

37:55.577 --> 37:57.840
And then Nicholas warned me,
and now he's dead.[door opens]

37:57.884 --> 37:59.494
CHUNK:
Hey, boss.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.191
Little champagne?

38:01.235 --> 38:03.281
Uh...

38:03.324 --> 38:05.805
No, I'm not really
in a champagne mood.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.156
What's wrong?
You worried about the verdict?

38:10.157 --> 38:12.115
Yeah, in a way.

38:12.159 --> 38:15.293
Something
just doesn't feel right.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.643
Dr. Bull?

38:19.427 --> 38:21.516
Hey, Ed. What're you doing here?

38:21.560 --> 38:22.778
Sorry for just
dropping by like this,

38:22.822 --> 38:25.738
but, uh, can we
talk for a minute?

38:25.781 --> 38:27.261
In private?

38:28.480 --> 38:29.829
Uh, sure.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.184
What can I do for you, Ed?

38:38.228 --> 38:41.406
Did I ever tell you how I got
my first break in real estate?

38:43.190 --> 38:44.322
Ten years ago,

38:44.365 --> 38:46.802
when I was still a contractor,

38:46.846 --> 38:50.197
I was renovating a three-unit
brownstone in Greenpoint.

38:50.240 --> 38:54.288
I convinced the owner
to sell it to me off-market.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.159
Wasn't easy
to get the money together,

38:56.203 --> 38:59.511
but it was gonna be mine.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.730
Then, last minute,

39:01.774 --> 39:03.689
friends of the owners

39:03.732 --> 39:06.561
decided to buy the place
for their daughter

39:06.605 --> 39:10.260
as an investment property,
and they outbid me.

39:11.305 --> 39:12.872
Yeah.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.178
Real estate's
tricky. Listen,

39:15.222 --> 39:16.528
Ed, can we do this another time?

39:16.571 --> 39:19.182
I worked on my hands and knees
for months fixing up

39:19.226 --> 39:21.533
that place.
I knew every inch of it.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.362
Every board, every screw.

39:24.405 --> 39:27.408
And they were just gonna give it
to that spoiled brat?

39:27.452 --> 39:29.671
I couldn't let that happen.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.933
You know me.

39:30.977 --> 39:33.414
I'm a problem-solver.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.374
So, one night,

39:36.417 --> 39:38.680
I followed the daughter.

39:39.725 --> 39:42.684
Jodie Comroe was her name.

39:42.728 --> 39:44.338
I'd put a nail in her tire,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.602
and when it went flat,
I came to her rescue.

39:49.604 --> 39:50.736
Stupid little girl

39:50.779 --> 39:53.260
didn't even know
how to change a tire.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.656
Anyway, instead of changing it,

39:57.699 --> 40:00.310
I bashed her head in
with the tire iron.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.661
I put her body in a barrel

40:02.704 --> 40:04.880
and buried it
in Saunders Woods

40:04.924 --> 40:06.708
out in Pennsylvania.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.276
Nice, quiet spot

40:09.319 --> 40:12.671
near some old columns
above the creek.

40:12.714 --> 40:15.500
That's what Nicholas had on you.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.719
He knew about the murder.

40:19.765 --> 40:21.244
The cops questioned me,

40:21.288 --> 40:23.812
but Nicholas gave me an alibi,
and they moved on.

40:23.856 --> 40:25.858
It was all ancient history

40:25.901 --> 40:29.383
until he showed up
demanding a job

40:29.427 --> 40:30.950
and a place to stay,

40:30.993 --> 40:33.735
and then he started asking
for more and more cash.

40:34.997 --> 40:36.651
If only he wasn't so greedy,

40:36.695 --> 40:39.611
none of this
would've had to happen.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.614
Your tenants, Ed.

40:42.657 --> 40:45.486
You didn't even care
how many you killed.

40:46.574 --> 40:49.316
I couldn't take the risk
of him talking.

40:50.535 --> 40:52.362
I knew I'd get sued
for the leak,

40:52.406 --> 40:54.626
but that's
what insurance is for.

40:55.975 --> 40:59.631
The one thing I didn't count on
was getting arrested.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.505
But then you came to my rescue.

41:07.639 --> 41:10.076
Why are you telling me this now?

41:11.556 --> 41:13.819
When you asked me
about Nicholas...

41:15.342 --> 41:16.648
...I could tell.

41:16.691 --> 41:18.650
You knew something.

41:18.693 --> 41:21.522
You may not have known
everything yet,

41:21.566 --> 41:24.351
but I think
you would've kept digging.

41:25.352 --> 41:26.832
You're the type
who'd need to know

41:26.875 --> 41:29.095
if you were wrong about me.

41:30.357 --> 41:32.446
And if you figured out enough
on your own,

41:32.490 --> 41:34.492
you could bring it
to the police.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.453
But since I'm telling you
myself...

41:42.456 --> 41:44.719
It's privileged.

41:44.763 --> 41:47.069
That's right.

41:47.113 --> 41:50.029
Now it's our little secret.
