Yes, except not tonight.
I have dinner with my mama.

37:14.785 --> 37:17.053
Well, then, before you change your
mind, go ahead and slam the door.

37:17.087 --> 37:18.521
Yes, sir.

37:33.437 --> 37:35.238
Is it just you and me
in here?

37:35.306 --> 37:36.472
Yes, ma'am, it is.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.874
Good.

37:37.908 --> 37:40.043
It seems
we've hit a rough patch.

37:40.110 --> 37:43.112
And actually, you and Riley
have hit a rough patch, too.

37:43.147 --> 37:46.449
Yeah, well, I'm sure it's
nothing we all can't survive.

37:46.483 --> 37:48.017
As long as
we do it together.

37:51.222 --> 37:53.623
With all respect,
Georgia,

37:53.657 --> 37:56.626
I know this might've felt
like family at one time,

37:56.660 --> 37:58.361
you know,
before there were so many of us,

37:58.395 --> 38:02.432
but now we're not a family
looking out for one another.

38:02.499 --> 38:04.033
Times are tough.

38:04.101 --> 38:06.302
Now we're just
a bunch of business girls

38:06.337 --> 38:07.870
looking out for ourselves,
okay?

38:07.938 --> 38:10.006
They may not admit it,
and you may not, either,

38:10.040 --> 38:12.075
but doesn't mean
that's not the way it is.

38:12.142 --> 38:15.845
Well, this place will be
whatever we make it, right?

38:15.879 --> 38:17.647
Sure.

38:17.681 --> 38:21.317
And the last time I checked,
it's still my place.

38:21.352 --> 38:22.552
Understand?

38:24.221 --> 38:24.921
Yes, ma'am.

38:27.157 --> 38:29.425
You know, the one thing I've
always appreciated about you

38:29.460 --> 38:31.160
is your honesty.

38:31.195 --> 38:34.163
And I hope I can continue
to feel that way,

38:34.198 --> 38:37.233
because if you start
giving me the runaround,

38:37.301 --> 38:39.936
you and I --
oh, we're gonna have trouble.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.014
Hey.

38:51.048 --> 38:52.348
Hey.

38:52.383 --> 38:54.183
I thought
I'd be the first.

38:54.218 --> 38:56.286
Oh, well, when someone else
is buying, I try to be first.

38:56.320 --> 38:59.022
Wow.
You look fantastic.

38:59.056 --> 39:01.424
You trying to say
I don't always look fantastic?

39:01.492 --> 39:02.792
Oh, no.
It's just...

39:04.395 --> 39:05.595
...like you're a light.

39:06.630 --> 39:07.563
Thank you.

39:08.999 --> 39:11.467
Um, congrats on the job
again.

39:11.535 --> 39:13.303
Thanks.
Appreciate it.

39:13.337 --> 39:15.004
Hey, you deserve it.

39:15.039 --> 39:17.307
You know, I've been thinking
the last couple days,

39:17.341 --> 39:18.441
and I wanted to apologize.

39:18.475 --> 39:19.942
What for?

39:19.977 --> 39:21.444
For putting you
in the position

39:21.478 --> 39:23.813
to feel like you needed
to look after me and the kids.

39:23.847 --> 39:25.315
It's not
your responsibility.

39:25.349 --> 39:26.783
Oh, Riley, come on.

39:26.817 --> 39:28.384
No, you're their uncle
and Kyle's brother,

39:28.452 --> 39:30.453
but you're not my husband.

39:30.521 --> 39:32.922
So I need
to take care of myself.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.093
Okay.

39:37.161 --> 39:39.162
Um...

39:39.196 --> 39:43.032
Well, I hope you know
that you can still count on me.

39:43.067 --> 39:44.434
I know that.

39:44.468 --> 39:47.937
Look, we both have been
living in Kyle's shadow.

39:50.674 --> 39:54.177
There is an actual fainting
couch in the ladies' room.

[ Laughs ]

39:55.679 --> 39:57.347
Oh. Evan, I'm so happy
for your good fortune.

39:57.381 --> 39:59.048
Thank you, Linette.

39:59.083 --> 40:01.017
And I hear you have
a young lady joining us tonight.

40:01.051 --> 40:01.984
Yeah.

40:02.019 --> 40:03.553
Why, yes.
Where is she?

40:03.587 --> 40:05.455
I can't wait to meet her.

40:05.489 --> 40:07.490
I don't know.
I thought she'd be here by now.

40:09.393 --> 40:11.294
I know -- I'm late.

40:11.328 --> 40:13.363
I am so sorry.

40:13.430 --> 40:14.364
Hi.

40:14.431 --> 40:15.498
Hey.

40:15.532 --> 40:17.934
Thank you.
Thank you.
