01:39.450 --> 01:41.303
<i>We're all very proud</i>

01:41.327 --> 01:43.930
<i>of Judah Rosenthal's
philanthropic efforts,</i>

01:43.954 --> 01:47.629
<i>his endless hours of
fundraising for the hospital,</i>

01:48.292 --> 01:50.215
<i>the new medical center, and now,</i>

01:50.377 --> 01:51.771
<i>the ophthalmology wing,</i>

01:51.795 --> 01:55.095
<i>which, until this year,
had just been a dream.</i>

01:56.258 --> 01:58.320
<i>But it's Judah Rosenthal,
our friend,</i>

01:58.344 --> 01:59.891
<i>that we most appreciate.</i>

02:00.471 --> 02:03.395
<i>The husband, the father,
the golf companion.</i>

02:04.725 --> 02:06.119
<i>Naturally, if you have...</i>

02:06.143 --> 02:07.621
You're blushing, darling.

02:07.645 --> 02:09.646
<i>Day or night,
weekends or holidays.</i>

02:10.189 --> 02:12.417
<i>But you can also call
Judah to find out</i>

02:12.441 --> 02:14.489
<i>which is the best
restaurant in Paris.</i>

02:15.653 --> 02:16.825
<i>Or Athens</i>

02:17.154 --> 02:19.327
<i>or which hotel to
stay at in Moscow</i>

02:20.074 --> 02:23.499
<i>or the best recording of a
particular Mozart symphony.</i>

02:24.495 --> 02:27.349
My father is so nervous
about having to get up and speak.

02:27.373 --> 02:28.975
I know, I know.
I knew he was nervous

02:28.999 --> 02:32.103
when you didn't eat any of those
cocktail weenies at hors d'oeuvres.

02:32.127 --> 02:33.939
He was so courageous all week.

02:33.963 --> 02:36.066
Then suddenly tonight,
stage fright.

02:36.090 --> 02:39.094
Really, Judah, you were fine till
you got home from work today.

02:40.678 --> 02:41.863
Any mail?

02:41.887 --> 02:44.532
The mail's exactly where
I left it this morning.

02:44.556 --> 02:46.684
I haven't had a free
second all day.

02:46.976 --> 02:50.697
If you gotta take a shower, you better
do it because I have to use it, too.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.899
I dread making that speech tonight.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.803
<i>Dear Miriam Rosenthal,</i>

03:20.217 --> 03:22.028
<i>I'm at the lowest
point of my life</i>

03:22.052 --> 03:23.645
<i>as I write you this letter.</i>

03:24.471 --> 03:26.269
<i>I wish to cause no suffering,</i>

03:27.057 --> 03:29.327
<i>but because I'm going
through pure hell,</i>

03:29.351 --> 03:31.399
<i>I ask if you can
meet me one time.</i>

03:32.730 --> 03:35.574
<i>Your husband and I are
more than intimate friends</i>

03:36.108 --> 03:39.408
<i>and have been deeply in love
for over two years now.</i>

03:40.821 --> 03:42.007
<i>This must be faced</i>

03:42.031 --> 03:45.126
<i>as there are so many
ramifications and complications.</i>

03:45.993 --> 03:48.246
<i>Many promises were made,
etcetera.</i>

03:49.371 --> 03:52.090
<i>I need an open exchange
with you to clear things.</i>

03:53.250 --> 03:55.312
<i>For all three of us to go on,</i>

03:55.336 --> 03:58.431
<i>the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion.</i>

03:59.882 --> 04:01.725
<i>Please contact me at this number.</i>

04:02.926 --> 04:04.599
<i>I want what's best for everyone.</i>

04:05.512 --> 04:06.809
<i>Dolores Paley.</i>

04:30.621 --> 04:32.349
<i>That the new ophthalmology wing</i>

04:32.373 --> 04:34.876
<i>has become a reality is not
just a tribute to me,</i>

04:35.751 --> 04:37.628
<i>but to a spirit of community,</i>

04:37.961 --> 04:39.554
<i>generosity,</i>

04:39.755 --> 04:41.007
<i>of mutual caring,</i>

04:41.799 --> 04:43.176
<i>and answered prayers.</i>

04:44.301 --> 04:46.363
<i>Now it's funny I use the
term "answered prayers."</i>

04:46.387 --> 04:47.388
<i>You see,</i>

04:47.721 --> 04:49.189
<i>I'm a man of science.</i>

04:49.723 --> 04:51.350
<i>I've always been a skeptic,</i>

04:51.683 --> 04:53.536
<i>but I was raised
quite religiously.</i>

04:53.560 --> 04:55.779
<i>And while I challenged it,
even as a child,</i>

04:56.647 --> 04:58.900
<i>some of that feeling
must have stuck with me.</i>

05:00.442 --> 05:02.240
<i>I remember my father telling me,</i>

05:02.945 --> 05:05.368
<i>"the eyes of God
are on us always."</i>

05:06.365 --> 05:07.992
<i>The eyes of God.</i>

05:08.951 --> 05:10.999
<i>What a phrase to a young boy.</i>

05:11.995 --> 05:13.838
<i>I mean, what were God's eyes like?</i>

05:14.832 --> 05:18.336
<i>Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, I assumed.</i>

05:20.295 --> 05:22.482
<i>And I wonder if it was
just a coincidence</i>

05:22.506 --> 05:24.759
<i>that I made my
specialty ophthalmology.</i>

05:28.178 --> 05:30.115
I'm so proud of you, Judah.

05:30.139 --> 05:31.812
Surely we all are.

05:59.376 --> 06:01.354
Why did you write that letter?

06:01.378 --> 06:03.106
You know why.
We've been through it.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.442
You want to destroy my
life and my family?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.777
I want her to know
the kind of man she's married to.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.195
It was lying on the table all day.

06:09.219 --> 06:10.947
By sheer chance,
she didn't open it.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.699
By a miracle, I got it first.

06:12.723 --> 06:15.285
You told me over and over
again you'd leave Miriam.

06:15.309 --> 06:16.661
- We made plans.
- I didn't.

06:16.685 --> 06:18.455
You did! I gave up things for you!

06:18.479 --> 06:20.206
- Business opportunities.
- Oh, pipe dreams.

06:20.230 --> 06:21.666
And there were other
men who wanted me.

06:21.690 --> 06:23.067
What do you want from me?

06:23.358 --> 06:24.919
You think this was
an easy decision?

06:24.943 --> 06:26.880
I want what you
told me you wanted.

06:26.904 --> 06:28.381
To be together.
Otherwise, I...

06:28.405 --> 06:30.008
I don't know what I'll do, Judah.

06:30.032 --> 06:31.909
I'll jump out the window, I swear.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.762
You've been my whole
life for two years.

06:34.786 --> 06:36.639
I can't go back to the
way things were.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.350
I was at a low point when I met you.
You turned everything around.

06:39.374 --> 06:40.685
I never said I'd leave Miriam.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.187
That's wishful
thinking on your part.

06:42.211 --> 06:44.564
Yeah, well, there's no
passion left. It's boring.

06:44.588 --> 06:46.900
Those are your words,
unless you were lying to me.

06:46.924 --> 06:48.067
Now, that's not true.

06:48.091 --> 06:49.736
Or there's more to this than...
That I don't know.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.404
- You met someone else?
- What?

06:51.428 --> 06:52.739
Oh, come on, will you?

06:52.763 --> 06:54.282
For God's sake, Dolores.

06:54.306 --> 06:55.853
- Dolores.
- What?

06:56.266 --> 06:57.688
Now, look.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.604
I've lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

07:02.272 --> 07:03.958
I mean,
I can't go on leading two lives.

07:03.982 --> 07:06.878
Yeah, well, you're not doing her
any favor by pretending with her.

07:06.902 --> 07:08.588
I'm not going to be without you.

07:08.612 --> 07:10.465
I'm not going to let this
happen to me without a fight!

07:10.489 --> 07:12.258
- Wait a minute, listen.
- I wanna speak to Miriam!

07:12.282 --> 07:14.636
- I'm not gonna let this happen again.
- Dolores, nothing is happening,

07:14.660 --> 07:15.762
- all right?
- No.

07:15.786 --> 07:18.005
Yes. Now, listen to me, please.

07:18.121 --> 07:20.308
Just bear with me.
We'll work something out.

07:20.332 --> 07:22.300
Let me get my thoughts together.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.260
Just don't do anything rash.
Now...

07:24.753 --> 07:25.970
Dolores.

07:27.923 --> 07:29.095
What?

07:32.803 --> 07:34.146
It's gonna be okay.

07:37.015 --> 07:38.267
On, God.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.621
<i>- You were gonna wait until...
- Annie...</i>

07:41.645 --> 07:43.456
<i>And then throw me aside
like a squeezed lemon.</i>

07:43.480 --> 07:44.958
<i>Squeezed lemon.
Don't dramatize it.</i>

07:44.982 --> 07:46.834
<i>I've given you the best
years of my life</i>

07:46.858 --> 07:48.836
<i>and you were willing
to go on and on.</i>

07:48.860 --> 07:50.129
<i>- Get out of here.
- May I...</i>

07:50.153 --> 07:51.339
<i>I know you for what you are.</i>

07:51.363 --> 07:53.132
<i>I'm lucky I found you out.
You're going out of here.</i>

07:53.156 --> 07:54.373
<i>Those are my clothes!</i>

07:58.495 --> 08:00.306
- That was great, wasn't it?
- Yeah. I loved it.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.517
With the tuxedos
and the evening gowns and everything.

08:02.541 --> 08:03.810
I know. It was great.

08:03.834 --> 08:06.553
God, it was wonderful to
live like that. This is awful.

08:06.712 --> 08:08.552
Let me see if I can get a cab.
You stay here.

08:08.576 --> 08:09.576
Okay.

08:10.173 --> 08:12.277
So you want to go to the
movies again tomorrow?

08:12.301 --> 08:13.598
Oh, sure, Uncle Cliff.

08:14.428 --> 08:15.655
Jesus.

08:15.679 --> 08:18.558
Unless... Unless maybe we should
make it a museum day, you know?

08:18.932 --> 08:21.327
I promised your father
on his deathbed

08:21.351 --> 08:23.871
that I would give you
a well-rounded education.

08:23.895 --> 08:26.457
And, you know, we probably shouldn't
go to the movies every day.

08:26.481 --> 08:29.200
Just... Just once in a while.
Even though I'd love to.

08:29.693 --> 08:31.004
You know?

08:31.028 --> 08:32.171
So, while we wait for a cab,

08:32.195 --> 08:33.595
I'll give you your
lesson for today.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.706
Okay?

08:34.865 --> 08:36.342
<i>Your lesson is this,</i>

08:36.366 --> 08:38.803
don't listen to what
your schoolteachers tell you,

08:38.827 --> 08:40.346
you know?
Don't pay attention to that.

08:40.370 --> 08:41.764
Just... Just see
what they look like.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.559
And that's how you'll know what
life is really gonna be like.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.019
Ok? You heard it here first.

08:46.043 --> 08:48.091
I think I see a cab.
If we run quickly,

08:48.253 --> 08:50.847
we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

08:54.384 --> 08:55.556
I'm back.

08:56.053 --> 08:57.363
- Where were you?
- Oh.

08:57.387 --> 08:59.139
You know, just out and around.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.534
You probably took your niece
to the movies again.

09:01.558 --> 09:03.494
Oh, I'm crazy about that kid.

09:03.518 --> 09:05.038
You know, she's just great.

09:05.062 --> 09:06.706
My brother called. He's in town.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.042
He wants us to join him
for a little dinner party tonight.

09:09.066 --> 09:11.210
- Jesus.
- Oh, please, Clifford.

09:11.234 --> 09:12.462
You gonna make another scene?

09:12.486 --> 09:14.672
- Hey, I didn't make a scene last time.
- Yes, you certainly did.

09:14.696 --> 09:16.841
You were not nice
and your resentment showed.

09:16.865 --> 09:18.509
I don't resent him.
I've told you that.

09:18.533 --> 09:21.220
You know, I happen to think he's
a pompous ass. You don't see it

09:21.244 --> 09:23.222
- 'cause you're in love with him.
- What are you muttering?

09:23.246 --> 09:25.224
- I'm not muttering anything.
- You certainly are.

09:25.248 --> 09:27.101
You're running down
Lester under your breath.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.394
Hey, I like your brother Ben.

09:28.418 --> 09:30.563
Sure. Ben is a saint.
You're not jealous of Ben.

09:30.587 --> 09:32.065
You think I'm jealous of Lester

09:32.089 --> 09:33.524
because he's a television producer?

09:33.548 --> 09:35.777
No. I think you're jealous
because he's a much-honored,

09:35.801 --> 09:38.571
highly-respected man and he's
a millionaire 10 times over,

09:38.595 --> 09:40.198
and he's doing what
you'd like to be doing.

09:40.222 --> 09:42.575
Hey, listen,
I can't watch his stuff, ok.

09:42.599 --> 09:43.826
It's submental.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.787
I think he wants to talk
to you about a job.

09:45.811 --> 09:47.330
I don't need a job.

09:47.354 --> 09:50.278
And didn't I get honorable mention
at that festival in, in, in...

09:50.440 --> 09:53.419
In Cincinnati? The Cincinnati
Documentary Film Festival?

09:53.443 --> 09:54.837
This is what you're clinging to?

09:54.861 --> 09:57.114
Everybody got honorable
mention who showed up.

09:57.447 --> 09:59.700
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

10:08.917 --> 10:11.187
Wendy, Wendy, Cliff, come here.
I want you to meet Lisa.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.356
- Hi, this is my... My sister Wendy.
- Hi.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.899
- My brother-in-law Clifford.
- Hi.

10:14.923 --> 10:17.164
This is Lisa Crosley.
Lisa's gonna star in my new series.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.403
I'm not really starring.

10:18.427 --> 10:20.113
Yeah, well,
you're one of the stars.

10:20.137 --> 10:22.073
- It's an ensemble piece.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:22.097 --> 10:23.533
- Tell them who you're playing.
- Hello, Lester.

10:23.557 --> 10:25.118
Oh, hi. Hello, darling.

10:25.142 --> 10:27.462
- I'm so glad you came.
- Thank you so much for inviting me.

10:27.477 --> 10:28.746
- It's a beautiful party.
- Thank you.

10:28.770 --> 10:31.374
Why don't you have a drink. I'll be
right... I'm gonna see you in a second.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.542
I'll be right there.

10:32.566 --> 10:35.002
She gave a bundle to
the Museum of Broadcasting.

10:35.026 --> 10:36.323
She paid a lot.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.256
She plays, uh, she plays, um...

10:38.280 --> 10:40.425
- A lawyer for the A.C.L.U.
- A.C.L.U. Yeah, yeah.

10:40.449 --> 10:42.802
With a husband who writes
for a conservative magazine.

10:42.826 --> 10:44.929
Yeah, gives us a chance
to get into issues, you know.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.306
We're gonna try to be fair
to both sides, but,

10:47.330 --> 10:49.684
knowing Lester, it'll be
heavily slanted to the left.

10:49.708 --> 10:51.144
Well, let's hope so.

10:51.168 --> 10:52.228
You know,
we're gonna shoot it here.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.813
- You're kidding. You'll be here?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.356
Yeah. I want to shoot
more shows in New York.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.733
- Oh, God. I couldn't be happier.
- I know. Me, too.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.776
- Oh, this is great.
- I know, I love this town. I mean, it's...

10:58.800 --> 11:01.760
You know, out there is such a Mickey
Mouse environment. I'm not interested.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.823
In fact, that's one
of the reasons I'm in this...

11:03.847 --> 11:05.324
- Hello, Lester.
- Hi, I want to talk to you.

11:05.348 --> 11:07.326
Don't go away.
I'll be right with you.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.871
Uh, we're go... A bunch of us
are getting together to, uh,

11:09.895 --> 11:11.914
to build major studio
space for production

11:11.938 --> 11:13.541
right here in,
you know, in the city.

11:13.565 --> 11:16.239
In fact... I'm sorry.
Just give me one second.

11:17.027 --> 11:18.574
Idea for series,

11:18.695 --> 11:20.673
a wealthy, high-profile builder

11:20.697 --> 11:23.217
who's always trying to realize,
uh, grandiose dreams

11:23.241 --> 11:25.303
Ã¡ la Donald Trump.
To be shot in New York.

11:25.327 --> 11:26.512
Look who's here.

11:26.536 --> 11:28.496
Oh, that's my brother Ben.
I want you to meet Ben.

11:28.497 --> 11:30.016
Ben, Ben, Carol, come here.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.520
- How are you, kid?
- Nice to see you.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.131
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.022
Hi, Cliff.

11:36.046 --> 11:37.815
Listen, how are you doing?
How are your eyes?

11:37.839 --> 11:39.817
Not so good.
It's not so optimistic.

11:39.841 --> 11:41.027
Oh, you're kidding.

11:41.051 --> 11:43.446
I've been seeing Dr. Rosenthal
for about three months.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.240
Uh, Lester, I'm sorry.
Don't you want to talk to Clifford?

11:46.264 --> 11:48.813
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Step into my office.
- Yeah, thank you.

11:49.434 --> 11:50.703
Hi.

11:50.727 --> 11:51.871
- Hi.
- I'm Lisa.

11:51.895 --> 11:54.040
- Oh, hi. We didn't meet. I'm sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:54.064 --> 11:55.486
So, are you in T.V., too?

11:56.650 --> 11:57.710
No.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.327
No. I'm a rabbi.

12:00.195 --> 12:02.197
You don't have to wear
an outfit or anything?

12:03.782 --> 12:06.469
Public television wants
to do a documentary on, you know...

12:06.493 --> 12:07.678
Well, follow me around.

12:07.702 --> 12:09.555
The way I talk, the way
I think, that kind of thing.

12:09.579 --> 12:12.332
<i>So it's for part of their,
uh, uh, Creative Mind series.</i>

12:12.958 --> 12:15.086
So I told them about you.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.395
Oh, thank you.

12:16.419 --> 12:18.379
You know, I'm...
I'm working on a thing of my own.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.233
- I'm putting together a little film.
- Yeah, I know.

12:20.257 --> 12:22.735
Wendy told me. You're trying
to make a film about, uh,

12:22.759 --> 12:25.279
some philosophy professor,
which is admirable. That's fine.

12:25.303 --> 12:28.032
But I'm... I'm... I'm offering you the
chance to earn some decent money,

12:28.056 --> 12:29.854
you know, reach a big audience.

12:29.975 --> 12:33.079
The last thing in the world you need
is for me to be your biographer.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.447
You know, I make
these little films on, on, you know,

12:35.564 --> 12:37.500
- toxic waste and starving children.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.085
Yeah, look, I'll be frank with you.

12:39.109 --> 12:40.920
You're not my first choice.

12:40.944 --> 12:42.630
I'm doing this strictly
as a favor to Wendy.

12:42.654 --> 12:45.094
She says you haven't worked in a
long time. She's embarrassed.

12:45.115 --> 12:47.593
I've worked. It's just that
nobody's paying me. I'm, you know...

12:47.617 --> 12:49.470
Look, I know you
don't respect what I do,

12:49.494 --> 12:51.931
I understand that. But, you
know, I got a closet full of Emmys.

12:51.955 --> 12:54.433
You, you realize that. Oh, all right,
okay. You think that's bullshit.

12:54.457 --> 12:56.269
Fine. Okay, fine.
I understand. Fine.

12:56.293 --> 12:59.272
I don't know. Maybe I could use the
money to finish my movie.

12:59.296 --> 13:01.469
You know, I... I do have
some debts and things.

13:02.132 --> 13:03.693
Idea for farce.

13:03.717 --> 13:04.944
A poor, uh...

13:04.968 --> 13:07.947
A poor loser agrees to do the
story of a great man's life

13:07.971 --> 13:10.565
and in the process comes
to learn deep values.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.163
<i>What will you be
doing in Boston?</i>

13:16.187 --> 13:18.110
<i>I'm lecturing at a symposium.</i>

13:18.565 --> 13:20.283
Incidentally, my name's Dolores.

13:21.109 --> 13:23.045
- Hello, Dolores.
- Hello.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.117
- Pretty name.
- Thank you very much.

13:25.655 --> 13:27.758
<i>Do you go to Boston often?</i>

13:27.782 --> 13:29.625
<i>Not very often. No, I...</i>

13:30.243 --> 13:32.305
<i>Don't know anyone
in Boston, actually.</i>

13:32.329 --> 13:33.626
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

13:41.796 --> 13:43.149
- Good morning.
- Hi, hi.

13:43.173 --> 13:45.596
A Miss Paley called,
and said it was urgent.

13:52.641 --> 13:54.188
Why did you phone me?

13:54.476 --> 13:56.194
I told you I'd call you.

13:56.519 --> 13:58.237
I couldn't help it.

13:58.355 --> 14:00.357
I was going out of my skin.

14:02.359 --> 14:04.077
I have to see you later.

14:04.819 --> 14:06.412
I have to.

14:07.781 --> 14:08.907
Okay.

14:09.824 --> 14:11.451
After work is okay.

14:15.205 --> 14:16.502
I see it.

14:17.207 --> 14:18.379
Yeah.

14:19.584 --> 14:20.881
I see it.

14:22.379 --> 14:23.676
Oh, God.

14:24.798 --> 14:25.890
What?

14:27.717 --> 14:29.139
I need to take a minute.

14:31.763 --> 14:33.185
What's wrong, Judah?

14:35.141 --> 14:36.609
I'm in such trouble, Ben.

14:37.060 --> 14:38.437
What is it?

14:39.729 --> 14:41.322
I need to talk to someone.

14:42.399 --> 14:43.525
Sure.

14:44.734 --> 14:47.129
We've known each other many years.
You're a religious man.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.826
I'm... Okay, I'm not.

14:48.947 --> 14:50.466
We've differed on many points,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.208
but you're somebody I do respect.

14:53.576 --> 14:54.971
May I confide in you?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.338
Of course.

14:57.247 --> 14:59.466
Go ahead.
Everything's confidential.

15:04.087 --> 15:06.135
I've done a foolish thing.

15:06.589 --> 15:09.308
Senseless, vain, dumb.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.015
Another woman.

15:19.310 --> 15:22.280
Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.335
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone, I don't know.

15:26.359 --> 15:28.782
But now my life's about
to go up in smoke.

15:30.238 --> 15:31.924
Can't you break it off?

15:31.948 --> 15:33.495
The woman won't allow it.

15:34.576 --> 15:36.595
She's young.
She's very unstable.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.462
She's an hysteric.

15:39.289 --> 15:40.791
And vindictive.

15:41.082 --> 15:42.755
And it's my fault.

15:42.917 --> 15:45.215
I instigated it.
I prolonged it.

15:45.962 --> 15:49.011
Many times I tried to back off,
but I was too weak.

15:49.257 --> 15:51.385
But I promised her nothing.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.562
But did I?
See, I don't even know anymore.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.149
In the heat of passion,
you say things.

15:58.308 --> 16:00.578
All I know is, after two years
of shameful deceit,

16:00.602 --> 16:01.871
where I led this double life,

16:01.895 --> 16:03.488
I awakened as if from a dream

16:04.355 --> 16:06.500
and realized what I'd be losing.

16:06.524 --> 16:08.294
It's called wisdom.

16:08.318 --> 16:10.320
It comes to some suddenly.

16:10.445 --> 16:14.200
We realize the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

16:14.616 --> 16:17.916
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.755
You know,
I kidded myself about loving her,

16:21.164 --> 16:22.725
but deep down I knew,

16:22.749 --> 16:24.547
knowing I behaved selfishly.

16:24.667 --> 16:27.341
For pleasure,
for adventure, for lust.

16:27.837 --> 16:30.590
Sometimes when there's
real love and

16:31.591 --> 16:33.152
true acknowledgment of a mistake,

16:33.176 --> 16:35.395
there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.140
I know Miriam.

16:38.973 --> 16:40.975
Her values, her feelings,

16:41.351 --> 16:43.120
her place among
our friends and colleagues...

16:43.144 --> 16:44.330
But what choice do you have

16:44.354 --> 16:46.290
if the woman is going to tell her?
You...

16:46.314 --> 16:49.001
You have to confess the wrong

16:49.025 --> 16:50.586
and hope for understanding and

16:50.610 --> 16:53.363
maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too,

16:53.822 --> 16:56.371
and you have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

16:57.534 --> 17:00.096
And maybe you and Miriam
can never go back to the old life,

17:00.120 --> 17:03.516
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.017
Maybe I...

17:05.040 --> 17:06.714
Maybe even a richer one.

17:08.877 --> 17:10.255
You know what's funny?

17:11.047 --> 17:13.141
Our entire adult lives,

17:13.424 --> 17:16.153
you and I have been having

17:16.176 --> 17:18.405
this same conversation
in one form or another.

17:18.429 --> 17:19.490
Yes, I know.

17:19.513 --> 17:21.534
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

17:21.558 --> 17:25.563
You see it as harsh
and empty of values and pitiless,

17:26.396 --> 17:29.875
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

17:29.899 --> 17:32.243
a moral structure with real meaning

17:32.443 --> 17:34.411
and forgiveness.

17:35.071 --> 17:36.632
And some kind of higher power.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.079
Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.679
And I know you well enough to know

17:41.703 --> 17:44.456
that a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.

17:45.248 --> 17:47.717
Now, you're talking to me
like your congregation.

17:49.752 --> 17:51.897
It's true.
We went from a small infidelity

17:51.921 --> 17:53.594
to the meaning of existence.

17:54.716 --> 17:58.220
Miriam won't think two years
of scheming and dishonesty is a...

17:58.928 --> 18:00.430
ls a small infidelity.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.946
Oh, how can you do it?

18:16.613 --> 18:17.956
I give up.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.467
God, you're in such
wonderful shape.

18:20.491 --> 18:22.619
- For a man my age.
- For any age.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.599
I was actually quite athletic
when I was a young student.

18:26.623 --> 18:28.500
You still make love
like a young student.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.024
Yeah?

18:29.042 --> 18:30.385
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

18:33.713 --> 18:34.940
You know,

18:34.964 --> 18:36.404
I don't think we
should do this here.

18:36.424 --> 18:37.651
Well, why not?
We're all alone.

18:37.675 --> 18:38.903
I don't know.

18:38.927 --> 18:40.529
I feel a little self-conscious.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.781
Let's go back to the
cottage and light a fire.

18:42.805 --> 18:44.450
And you can play me the Schumann.

18:44.474 --> 18:45.771
Schubert.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.102
- Schumann is flowery.
- Oh.

18:48.353 --> 18:49.622
Schubert is...

18:49.646 --> 18:51.081
Well, reminds me of you.

18:51.105 --> 18:52.197
The sad one.

18:52.482 --> 18:53.654
Schubert.

18:53.816 --> 18:55.794
God, you have to teach me all that.

18:55.818 --> 18:57.963
I'm so ignorant in classical music.

18:57.987 --> 18:59.239
I'll teach you.

18:59.447 --> 19:01.541
<i>Someday, we'll have a lot of time.</i>

19:17.423 --> 19:19.346
Would you like a drink?

19:20.969 --> 19:23.472
Yeah. Well, fix me
whatever you're having.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.908
Why did you call the house last
night and hang up, huh, Del?

19:37.193 --> 19:39.036
I'm not playing games, Judah.

19:40.363 --> 19:42.675
Just because you've decided
I'm through in your life

19:42.699 --> 19:45.052
doesn't mean I'm gonna
roll over and die.

19:45.076 --> 19:47.204
What the hell happened to us?
I mean...

19:47.996 --> 19:49.348
We had a wonderful few years.

19:49.372 --> 19:51.124
We both knew it
couldn't go on forever.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.769
I gave up things for you.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.521
Oh, come on.
That's poppycock.

19:55.545 --> 19:57.147
Don't give me that, will you?

19:57.171 --> 19:58.388
For God's sakes.

19:58.756 --> 20:01.635
There were no business opportunities.
It's all in your head.

20:02.010 --> 20:03.696
No lovers begging for your hand.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.269
I mean, I prevented nothing.
I... I... I...

20:07.098 --> 20:08.395
Can we not argue?

20:08.975 --> 20:10.411
I just wanted to talk.

20:10.435 --> 20:11.687
I'm just so rattled.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.234
I have an idea.

20:15.773 --> 20:17.918
I thought if we could get away.
Just...

20:17.942 --> 20:20.115
Just for a little while
on one of our trips.

20:21.404 --> 20:23.716
Our trips are the warmest
memories I have,

20:23.740 --> 20:25.301
not just in our relationship,

20:25.325 --> 20:27.748
but some of the loveliest
times I've ever had.

20:28.077 --> 20:30.796
And you're always so much
more relaxed away from home.

20:31.205 --> 20:32.832
You come to life.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.967
Your whole face changes.

20:35.752 --> 20:37.720
I thought if we could just

20:37.920 --> 20:40.548
get away to Boston or Washington,

20:40.798 --> 20:42.568
just without any
preconceived notions...

20:42.592 --> 20:44.390
I can't go away, Del.

20:46.429 --> 20:48.549
- Just a weekend, just to be together.
- I can't, Del.

20:48.556 --> 20:50.103
- Why not?
- I can't.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.494
- You won't.
- Of course, I won't.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.690
Right.

20:55.605 --> 20:56.777
Why not?

21:00.193 --> 21:02.571
Because you're very unrealistic,
you know that?

21:04.113 --> 21:05.740
Sit, sit down for a second.

21:06.908 --> 21:08.285
Let's talk.

21:11.621 --> 21:12.713
Look.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.416
I've been...

21:16.000 --> 21:17.502
I've been thinking, too,

21:17.960 --> 21:19.257
and it...

21:19.670 --> 21:21.468
it occurs to me, I mean, if I...

21:21.839 --> 21:24.651
If I have caused you
to miss out on any opportunities

21:24.675 --> 21:26.445
that might have been
lucrative for you,

21:26.469 --> 21:28.614
I'm... I'm perfectly prepared
to, to reimburse you.

21:28.638 --> 21:30.657
I mean, I certainly don't
want to feel I've cost you...

21:30.681 --> 21:32.854
I'm not after your goddamn money!

21:33.434 --> 21:35.037
I want to speak to Miriam.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.663
- It's her problem, too.
- Now keep her out of it.

21:36.687 --> 21:39.691
- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it, all right?

21:42.652 --> 21:45.747
I think she should know her husband
is a liar and an embezzler.

21:50.827 --> 21:52.704
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

21:54.872 --> 21:56.392
I'm not blind.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.561
I know what went on between those
philanthropies and your stocks.

21:59.585 --> 22:02.064
I took nothing, not a nickel, ever.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.941
My conscience is completely clear.

22:03.965 --> 22:05.734
You needed money
to cover your losses.

22:05.758 --> 22:07.820
- I was around when it was happening.
- Okay, okay.

22:07.844 --> 22:10.188
I needed some temporary help.
I mean,

22:10.471 --> 22:12.616
for Christ's sake.
I mean, after a lifetime of hard work,

22:12.640 --> 22:15.189
a man doesn't sit still and watch
himself go down the toilet.

22:15.351 --> 22:16.568
I mean, does he?

22:16.769 --> 22:19.613
And moving around funds
is certainly not stealing.

22:20.523 --> 22:22.764
- Without asking or telling anyone?
- Look, listen to me.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.823
Every cent was accounted
for with interest.

22:26.529 --> 22:29.007
I don't think they
would see it that way.

22:29.031 --> 22:31.260
So this is it, right?
This is what you plan on doing.

22:31.284 --> 22:33.345
You're gonna hold on
to me with threats, right?

22:33.369 --> 22:36.014
Stupid threats and slander.

22:36.038 --> 22:37.359
This is your idea of love, right?

22:37.373 --> 22:40.217
I will not be tossed out!
I want to speak to Miriam!

22:40.501 --> 22:42.062
Think, for Christ's sake!

22:42.086 --> 22:44.384
Well, think... Think what the hell
you're doing to me, will you?

22:44.547 --> 22:45.764
Please.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.762
I can't figure it out.

22:48.509 --> 22:49.635
I need you.

22:51.387 --> 22:52.730
Del.

22:54.640 --> 22:57.411
I love New York. I was
born in that building right there.

22:57.435 --> 23:00.530
Behind the... The guy, uh, the statue
there, the guy on the pedestal.

23:00.855 --> 23:02.332
I love New York. It's like, uh,

23:02.356 --> 23:04.293
it's like thousands of,
uh, straight lines

23:04.317 --> 23:06.285
just looking for a punch line,
you know?

23:07.111 --> 23:09.739
And what makes New York
such a funny place, is that

23:09.947 --> 23:13.635
there's so much tension and pain
and misery and craziness here.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.596
And they got...
That's the first part of comedy.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.222
But see, you got to get
some distance from it.

23:17.246 --> 23:18.390
You know what I mean?

23:18.414 --> 23:20.350
That the main...
The thing to remember about comedy is,

23:20.374 --> 23:23.187
if it's... If it bends, it's funny.

23:23.211 --> 23:25.105
If it breaks, it's not funny.

23:25.129 --> 23:27.316
So you gotta get back from the pain.
You see what I mean?

23:27.340 --> 23:28.567
But the... The, uh...

23:28.591 --> 23:31.195
Like they said, they asked
me up in, uh, at Harvard,

23:31.219 --> 23:33.363
a bunch of kids asked me,
"Why... What's comedy?"

23:33.387 --> 23:34.531
So, I said...
And then this is...

23:34.555 --> 23:36.950
This is part of what I'm trying
to say about getting back from it.

23:36.974 --> 23:40.023
I, I said,
"comedy is tragedy plus time."

23:40.895 --> 23:42.456
Tragedy plus time.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.416
See, when...
The night Lincoln was shot,

23:44.440 --> 23:46.752
you couldn't joke about it.
You couldn't make a joke about that.

23:46.776 --> 23:48.128
You just couldn't do it.

23:48.152 --> 23:51.452
Now time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

23:52.073 --> 23:54.426
See what I mean?
It's tragedy plus time.

23:54.450 --> 23:56.011
Okay. We're out.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.287
That's it? So fast?

23:57.995 --> 24:00.474
I shot up 10 rolls on
your first question.

24:00.498 --> 24:02.601
All right, I gotta...
I gotta get to CBS Anyway.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.826
Remember where we were.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

24:04.835 --> 24:06.271
Just... Just remember
what I was saying.

24:06.295 --> 24:07.940
- What do you think? All right?
- Excellent.

24:07.964 --> 24:09.525
- Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.692
I'm gonna do it more...

24:10.716 --> 24:12.277
I'm gonna be more relaxed
tomorrow, you know?

24:12.301 --> 24:13.987
I'm gonna do that tragedy stuff.
I got good stuff on that.

24:14.011 --> 24:15.739
Yeah, this is Halley Reed
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.

24:15.763 --> 24:17.356
Listen, would you...
Would you excuse me one second?

24:17.723 --> 24:19.409
Listen, I know I told
you this before,

24:19.433 --> 24:21.578
but if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

24:21.602 --> 24:23.163
Wouldn't you rather
leave it to science?

24:23.187 --> 24:24.748
- That's okay, I'll wait. Thank you.
- Will you listen?

24:24.772 --> 24:27.652
Will you listen? I'm offering you my heart.
You're squashing it. Come on.

24:27.858 --> 24:30.504
When are you gonna quit
this organization, come work for me?

24:30.528 --> 24:33.090
Oh, you'd fire me.
I'm much too opinionated.

24:33.114 --> 24:34.508
No, no, no.

24:34.532 --> 24:36.176
- That's okay. I'll wait.
- Listen, I like...

24:36.200 --> 24:37.970
I like mental stimulation.

24:37.994 --> 24:39.638
You tried shock therapy?

24:39.662 --> 24:41.431
That's good, that's funny.
That's very good.

24:41.455 --> 24:43.016
Listen, Lester.
I'm sorry, but we've got...

24:43.040 --> 24:44.643
OK, I'll be...
I'll be right with you.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.186
Wait in the car for me.
Wait in the car.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.479
Arthur, wait in the car.

24:47.503 --> 24:48.897
- Would you please come?
- Yes.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.732
- You promise?
- Wait in the car. Wait in the car.

24:50.756 --> 24:52.025
Yes. I... I was holding

24:52.049 --> 24:53.600
for Mr. Kurnitz, please.
It's Halley Reed.

24:53.624 --> 24:54.486
What do you think?

24:54.510 --> 24:56.947
Why don't you come with me
down to Barbados?

24:56.971 --> 24:59.157
We'll swim, you know,
we'll get some sun...

24:59.181 --> 25:00.854
Sorry. I freckle.

25:01.309 --> 25:03.537
That's my best shot.
I can't do any better than that.

25:03.561 --> 25:04.830
That's okay. I'll wait.

25:04.854 --> 25:05.998
Okay. Look, think about it, okay?

25:06.022 --> 25:08.195
Please think about it.
Talk to you tomorrow.

25:10.067 --> 25:11.284
Oh.

25:17.199 --> 25:19.827
Yeah. It's Halley Reed.
You cut me off.

25:20.244 --> 25:21.346
Excuse...

25:21.370 --> 25:22.431
Okay.

25:22.455 --> 25:24.016
Excuse me.
We haven't officially met.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.267
Hi. I'm Halley Reed.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.935
I'm one of the associate producers.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.312
I'm Clifford Stern.

25:28.336 --> 25:30.856
Can I ask you the same
question that I asked the producer?

25:30.880 --> 25:32.691
What do you bother
with this guy for?

25:32.715 --> 25:35.027
I mean, he's, you know,
he's such a pompous bore,

25:35.051 --> 25:37.362
- and your show does such great profiles.
- Well, listen,

25:37.386 --> 25:38.822
I'll tell you just
between you and me.

25:38.846 --> 25:40.866
I wanted to do
Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

25:40.890 --> 25:42.034
That's perfect.

25:42.058 --> 25:44.202
They like to mix it up.
They like a little variety.

25:44.226 --> 25:46.163
After all, he is an
American phenomenon.

25:46.187 --> 25:47.831
Yeah, but so is acid rain.

25:47.855 --> 25:49.875
Boy, you really don't
like him, do you?

25:49.899 --> 25:51.585
I love him like a brother.

25:51.609 --> 25:53.003
David Greenglass.

25:53.027 --> 25:55.547
So, why... Why are
you doing this show?

25:55.571 --> 25:58.550
It's very unusual for them to bring
in an outside person like this.

25:58.574 --> 26:01.303
Well, yes, I know. I'm... I'm
doing it strictly for the money.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.889
I wanna, you know... I'm trying to
make my own documentary on...

26:03.913 --> 26:05.515
I'm doing a profile on a guy

26:05.539 --> 26:07.809
who would be absolutely
perfect for your show.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.603
- He would be worthy.
- Yeah, who's that?

26:09.627 --> 26:12.255
His name is Louis Levy.
Do, do, do you have

26:12.421 --> 26:13.673
a little time?

26:14.757 --> 26:16.851
<i>Now, the unique thing that happened</i>

26:17.760 --> 26:20.572
<i>to the early Israelites was</i>

26:20.596 --> 26:23.099
<i>that they conceive a god that,
that cares.</i>

26:24.058 --> 26:26.902
<i>He cares, but at the same time,</i>

26:27.269 --> 26:29.790
<i>he also demands</i>

26:29.814 --> 26:31.487
<i>that you behave morally.</i>

26:32.108 --> 26:34.127
<i>But here comes the paradox.</i>

26:34.151 --> 26:37.371
<i>What's one of the first things
that, that God asks?</i>

26:38.114 --> 26:40.384
<i>That God asks Abraham</i>

26:40.408 --> 26:43.628
<i>to sacrifice his only son,</i>

26:43.786 --> 26:45.709
<i>his beloved son to him.</i>

26:46.288 --> 26:49.337
<i>In other words, in spite
of millennia of efforts,</i>

26:50.292 --> 26:52.670
<i>we have not succeeded to create</i>

26:53.129 --> 26:55.357
<i>a really and entirely</i>

26:55.381 --> 26:57.179
<i>loving image of God.</i>

26:57.550 --> 27:00.429
<i>This was beyond our
capacity to imagine.</i>

27:02.430 --> 27:04.282
Boy, he's really interesting.

27:04.306 --> 27:06.076
I know.
This is a fascinating guy.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.452
He could be wonderful
for the series.

27:07.476 --> 27:10.122
Well, that would be great.
You want to dump Lester and do him?

27:10.146 --> 27:12.249
'Cause I would love to...
You know, we could scrap Lester...

27:12.273 --> 27:13.625
We can't do...
We can't dump Lester,

27:13.649 --> 27:16.461
but I could talk them into
a little financing for you.

27:16.485 --> 27:18.964
And if this, you know,
if all this comes together right,

27:18.988 --> 27:20.090
and it should,

27:20.114 --> 27:21.258
I... I can tell you right now,

27:21.282 --> 27:23.218
we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.929
That would be wonderful.
For me to get something on your series

27:25.953 --> 27:27.848
- would be such a feather in my cap. Here.
- Thanks.

27:27.872 --> 27:29.015
You know, that would be great.

27:29.039 --> 27:30.684
That would be the biggest
audience I ever had.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.144
Well, great.
You know, let's work on it.

27:32.168 --> 27:33.368
Let's... Let's make it happen.

27:33.377 --> 27:34.512
Really? I got so much
good footage on him.

27:34.536 --> 27:34.938
Thank you.

27:34.962 --> 27:36.356
You know, even though we just met,

27:36.380 --> 27:38.066
I've taken an instant
liking to you.

27:38.090 --> 27:39.558
And I to him.

27:44.263 --> 27:46.158
Hi. I thought I'd come
by on my way home.

27:46.182 --> 27:47.451
- I... I got Jenny a present.
- Okay, come on in.

27:47.475 --> 27:48.827
Is that you, Uncle Cliff?

27:48.851 --> 27:51.354
Yes, Jenny.
I got you something.

27:51.687 --> 27:53.039
I got you a great book.

27:53.063 --> 27:54.875
I got you an absolutely
terrific book.

27:54.899 --> 27:56.168
Hi, how are you?

27:56.192 --> 27:59.504
I got you this great book with great
pictures of old New York in it.

27:59.528 --> 28:00.756
Look at this.
Here, look at this.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.799
- This is old 5th Avenue. See?
- Oh, my God.

28:02.823 --> 28:04.926
- I told you, carriages and top hats.
- It's great.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.052
I told you.

28:06.076 --> 28:08.138
Then, there's a whole
section on speakeasies, here,

28:08.162 --> 28:09.514
which is really interesting.

28:09.538 --> 28:11.099
- And that's the Flatiron Building.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.185
Which is a very famous building.
I'm in a great mood today.

28:13.209 --> 28:15.437
I had a creative breakthrough,
so my juices are flowing.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.731
I heard you got some action
on your ad in the personals

28:17.755 --> 28:18.982
which is, I guess, terrific.

28:19.006 --> 28:21.318
This is the old
Madison Square Garden.

28:21.342 --> 28:22.527
Jen,

28:22.551 --> 28:25.155
- don't you have some homework to finish?
- Yeah. I have to go do that.

28:25.179 --> 28:26.490
So, we'll...
We'll look at this later.

28:26.514 --> 28:27.595
But there's great pictures.

28:27.598 --> 28:28.700
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

28:28.724 --> 28:29.896
Cliff.

28:30.684 --> 28:32.357
What's the matter?

28:32.645 --> 28:34.122
I'm a wreck.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.693
What... What is it?

28:36.607 --> 28:37.950
I'm a wreck.

28:38.859 --> 28:42.705
Barbara, Barbara, what's...
What's the matter?

28:43.197 --> 28:44.883
- I feel sick.
- Barbara,

28:44.907 --> 28:46.885
- what... What is it?
- I'm still shaking.

28:46.909 --> 28:49.554
I've been shaking
like this for days.

28:49.578 --> 28:51.421
What? What's wrong?

28:53.916 --> 28:55.894
I've been going out with this man

28:55.918 --> 28:57.761
that I met through
the personal columns.

28:59.421 --> 29:00.673
<i>Very attractive.</i>

29:01.465 --> 29:03.183
<i>He was very nice.</i>

29:04.343 --> 29:06.530
<i>I went out with him three times.</i>

29:06.554 --> 29:07.948
<i>He was never fresh.</i>

29:07.972 --> 29:10.600
<i>He was always a
perfect gentleman.</i>

29:23.237 --> 29:26.299
<i>So we both came back here,</i>

29:26.323 --> 29:28.552
<i>and, um, Jenny was away.</i>

29:28.576 --> 29:31.204
<i>You know, she was sleeping
over at a friend's house.</i>

29:31.453 --> 29:34.377
<i>And it was like 1:00
in the morning or something,</i>

29:34.540 --> 29:37.134
<i>and we both had,
had a little to drink.</i>

29:38.002 --> 29:40.300
You know, I want to
tie you to the bed.

29:40.629 --> 29:42.732
- Really?
- And rip your dress off.

29:42.756 --> 29:43.882
Oh.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.223
Have you ever, uh, been bound up,

29:47.511 --> 29:49.364
tied up, and made love to?

29:49.388 --> 29:52.392
Um, I'm... I'm... I'm a...

29:52.516 --> 29:54.268
I'm a sensible gal.

29:55.853 --> 29:57.275
No more, you're not.

29:57.479 --> 29:58.480
Oh.

29:58.981 --> 30:00.233
God, Murray, God.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.742
God, uh...

30:03.068 --> 30:05.630
Barbara, I'm shocked
at what I'm hearing.

30:05.654 --> 30:06.965
You're my sister.

30:06.989 --> 30:08.967
You're this nice
middle-class mother.

30:08.991 --> 30:10.664
What...
What are you telling me?

30:11.285 --> 30:12.637
I couldn't move.

30:12.661 --> 30:15.130
I was tied tightly to the bedposts.

30:15.789 --> 30:17.017
Oh, Jesus.

30:17.041 --> 30:19.269
By a...
A guy that you didn't know?

30:19.293 --> 30:22.092
Well, now... Now you're gonna tell
me that he robbed you, right?

30:22.755 --> 30:23.847
No.

30:25.090 --> 30:27.138
He got on top of me and...

30:28.886 --> 30:30.447
- And what? What?
- I can't say it.

30:30.471 --> 30:32.449
I just... I can't say it.

30:32.473 --> 30:34.851
What? Tell me.
What's so terrible?

30:35.851 --> 30:37.353
He sat over me

30:37.895 --> 30:39.706
and went to the bathroom.

30:39.730 --> 30:42.167
Oh! Oh! Oh!

30:42.191 --> 30:44.114
That's so disgusting!

30:44.234 --> 30:45.629
Oh, my God.

30:45.653 --> 30:47.672
That's the worst thing
I ever heard in my life!

30:47.696 --> 30:49.841
Then he took his clothes and left.

30:49.865 --> 30:52.636
Oh, Barbara, you idiot!

30:52.660 --> 30:54.346
This guy could've cut your throat.

30:54.370 --> 30:55.722
He could've murdered you.

30:55.746 --> 30:57.373
I would've preferred it.

30:57.539 --> 30:59.017
Oh, Jesus, you're such a dope!

30:59.041 --> 31:00.894
I wish I could have
sympathy for this.

31:00.918 --> 31:03.355
- That's the...
- Oh, that's so easy for you to say,

31:03.379 --> 31:05.315
but I'm so lonely.

31:05.339 --> 31:07.651
You don't know what it's
like to be by yourself

31:07.675 --> 31:09.194
all the time.

31:09.218 --> 31:11.655
Look, I'm sure you're lonely,
I know it's painful,

31:11.679 --> 31:15.033
but promise me that you're never
gonna place another ad again.

31:15.057 --> 31:17.035
Because that's just,
you know, it's ridiculous.

31:17.059 --> 31:19.454
My whole life is passing me by,

31:19.478 --> 31:21.776
and I don't have anyone to love.

31:22.106 --> 31:24.501
I know that's so hard
for you to comprehend

31:24.525 --> 31:26.044
because you're married.

31:26.068 --> 31:28.254
But it's just so lonely out there.

31:28.278 --> 31:31.091
I mean, you have a
wife and you love her,

31:31.115 --> 31:32.467
and that's so nice.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.718
Let me tell you something.

31:33.742 --> 31:36.179
Things are not so good
between my wife and myself

31:36.203 --> 31:37.889
just so you don't
get any illusions.

31:37.913 --> 31:40.917
You know, we're... We... We've been
coming apart for the last year.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.311
You know, it's just that
neither of us has the energy

31:43.335 --> 31:44.646
to do anything about it,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.263
but it's not so great.

32:02.062 --> 32:03.359
A strange man

32:03.856 --> 32:05.654
defecated on my sister.

32:07.568 --> 32:08.740
Why?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.165
I don't know.

32:13.323 --> 32:14.996
Is there any...
Is there any

32:15.325 --> 32:18.454
reason I could give you that would
answer that satisfactorily?

32:19.538 --> 32:21.040
You know, it's just so...

32:21.415 --> 32:23.417
Human sexuality is just...

32:23.917 --> 32:25.635
It's so mysterious

32:25.836 --> 32:27.884
which I guess is, you know,

32:28.213 --> 32:29.806
I guess is good in a way.

32:32.134 --> 32:34.603
Yeah, well, I gotta be up at 7:00.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.960
I knew it had to be some
kind of a deep, dark secret

32:48.984 --> 32:50.503
for you to stoop to call me.

32:50.527 --> 32:52.297
I mean, to actually
invite me to your home.

32:52.321 --> 32:54.340
Come on, Jack,
don't hit me while I'm down.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.009
I mean, who should I
turn to but a brother?

32:56.033 --> 32:57.635
I've been there for you.

32:57.659 --> 32:58.720
I'm here, aren't I?

32:58.744 --> 33:01.293
So don't make sharp cracks.
I didn't stoop to call you.

33:01.497 --> 33:02.874
I'm in serious trouble.

33:03.499 --> 33:06.048
She won't take money,
she won't listen to reason.

33:06.293 --> 33:08.762
I even toyed with the idea of
telling everything to Miriam,

33:09.463 --> 33:11.340
but she'd never be
able to live with it.

33:11.465 --> 33:14.435
Add to that, her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

33:15.135 --> 33:16.696
Not that I stole, but I...

33:16.720 --> 33:18.188
I was indiscreet and

33:18.847 --> 33:21.316
if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.193
What would you like me to do?

33:23.352 --> 33:25.150
I don't know, but she's killing me.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.153
Want me to have
somebody talk to her?

33:28.649 --> 33:29.901
Like what?

33:30.025 --> 33:31.368
Straighten her out.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.005
What do you mean, threaten her?

33:34.029 --> 33:35.201
That's all I need.

33:35.697 --> 33:37.926
How else do you expect
to keep her quiet?

33:37.950 --> 33:40.703
I don't know.
Jack, I don't know.

33:42.913 --> 33:44.130
Well...

33:44.665 --> 33:46.633
Christ, Jack,
what are you suggesting?

33:47.543 --> 33:49.090
What did you call me for?

33:50.546 --> 33:51.856
I don't know. I... I hoped

33:51.880 --> 33:54.349
you'd have more experience
with something like this.

33:55.717 --> 33:58.363
You called me because you
needed some dirty work done.

33:58.387 --> 33:59.934
That's all you ever call for.

34:02.724 --> 34:04.351
Look how bitter you are.

34:05.894 --> 34:08.248
You've staked me plenty of times.

34:08.272 --> 34:10.491
I don't forget my obligations.

34:10.607 --> 34:13.030
Threatening her would
only make it worse, Jack.

34:13.902 --> 34:15.630
Okay. Forget about it.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.005
What do you want me to say?

34:17.030 --> 34:19.175
How the hell can I forget about it?

34:19.199 --> 34:20.667
I'm fighting for my life.

34:21.076 --> 34:23.579
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

34:24.329 --> 34:25.681
That's what I'm saying, Judah.

34:25.706 --> 34:27.225
If the woman won't
listen to reason,

34:27.248 --> 34:28.922
then you go on to the next step.

34:29.585 --> 34:31.271
What, threats? Violence?

34:31.295 --> 34:32.772
What are we talking about here?

34:32.795 --> 34:34.232
She can be gotten rid of.

34:34.255 --> 34:35.775
I mean, I know a lot of people.

34:35.799 --> 34:37.360
Money will buy whatever's necessary.

34:37.384 --> 34:39.744
I'm not even going to comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.063
Well, what did you want me
to do when you called me?

34:42.181 --> 34:44.603
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

34:47.060 --> 34:49.904
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam, now. She's...

34:51.356 --> 34:53.404
She's talking financial doings.

34:54.943 --> 34:56.570
I'm out of ideas.

34:57.613 --> 35:00.341
I don't know what I expected from you,
Jack, but maybe some help.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.010
You know, you're not aware

35:02.034 --> 35:03.636
of what goes on in this world.

35:03.660 --> 35:05.305
I mean, you sit up here
with your four acres

35:05.329 --> 35:07.056
- don't give me any of that stuff.
- ...and your country club

35:07.080 --> 35:09.392
- I don't want to hear about my success.
- ...and your rich friends and

35:09.416 --> 35:10.435
out there in the real world,

35:10.459 --> 35:12.604
- it's a whole different story.
- Come on.

35:12.628 --> 35:14.480
I've met a lot of characters
from when I had the restaurant...

35:14.504 --> 35:16.441
I know you have.
I've heard these stories before.

35:16.465 --> 35:18.610
From 7th Avenue,
from Atlantic City,

35:18.634 --> 35:21.779
and I'm not so high-class that I can
avoid looking at realities.

35:21.803 --> 35:24.522
I can't afford to be aloof.

35:25.015 --> 35:27.285
And you come to me
with a hell of a problem,

35:27.309 --> 35:29.152
and, uh, then you
get high-handed on me.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.624
Jack, I don't mean
to be high-handed.

35:32.648 --> 35:34.688
I haven't been sleeping nights.
I'm irritable, okay?

35:34.691 --> 35:36.489
- Okay. Okay. Forget I said anything.
- Okay.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.746
Now let me just get
something straight here.

35:45.535 --> 35:47.788
Am I understanding you right?
I mean...

35:49.498 --> 35:51.500
Are you suggesting
getting rid of her?

35:53.210 --> 35:54.678
You won't be involved.

35:55.087 --> 35:56.589
But I'll need some cash.

36:01.426 --> 36:03.099
What will they do?

36:03.971 --> 36:05.814
What'll they do?
They'll handle it.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.663
I can't believe I'm talking
about a human being.

36:11.687 --> 36:13.873
Jack, she's not an...
An insect.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.444
You don't just step on her.

36:17.109 --> 36:18.336
I know.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.408
Playing hardball was
never your game.

36:20.904 --> 36:23.007
You never liked to get
your hands dirty.

36:23.031 --> 36:25.659
But apparently this
woman is for real,

36:26.034 --> 36:28.128
and this thing isn't
just gonna go away.

36:30.872 --> 36:32.249
I can't do it.

36:34.251 --> 36:35.798
I can't think that way.

36:37.004 --> 36:38.005
No.

36:39.881 --> 36:40.882
Mmm-mmm.

36:47.556 --> 36:48.866
<i>Don't tell me.</i>

36:48.890 --> 36:50.326
<i>I don't want to know
anything about it.</i>

36:50.350 --> 36:51.852
<i>This is a work of art.</i>

36:52.769 --> 36:54.146
<i>The ropes come off,</i>

36:54.271 --> 36:57.000
<i>I tie sash weights
to her ankles with soft catgut.</i>

36:57.024 --> 36:58.835
<i>Please.
That's a horrible word.</i>

36:58.859 --> 37:00.461
<i>Look, get the angle on this.</i>

37:00.485 --> 37:02.880
<i>She disappears,
two weeks, maybe three,</i>

37:02.904 --> 37:04.215
<i>then up she pops,</i>

37:04.239 --> 37:05.800
<i>none of this stuff on her anymore.</i>

37:05.824 --> 37:07.826
<i>No marks. A suicide.</i>

37:08.410 --> 37:10.054
<i>Now, isn't that beautiful?</i>

37:10.078 --> 37:12.557
<i>It's loathsome.
Now be sure no one sees you.</i>

37:12.581 --> 37:13.891
<i>Don't worry, I'll take...</i>

37:13.915 --> 37:16.384
This only happens in the movies.

37:16.752 --> 37:18.479
Oh, listen, we should get back.

37:18.503 --> 37:20.940
Lester's going to be
leaving the hotel soon.

37:20.964 --> 37:22.400
It's okay. We'll make it.

37:22.424 --> 37:24.736
We've been shooting Lester all week.
I'm tired of it, you know.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.404
We... We'll catch him in time.

37:26.428 --> 37:28.489
I never should have
told you my weakness

37:28.513 --> 37:30.436
is going to the movies
in the daytime.

37:31.141 --> 37:33.745
I go all the time with my niece.
It's wonderful.

37:33.769 --> 37:35.621
You know, it's like playing hooky.

37:35.645 --> 37:38.249
Yeah, that's what you said yesterday.
We were late then, too.

37:38.273 --> 37:40.835
We weren't late.
We didn't miss anything. Here.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.211
Have another cheeseburger.

37:42.235 --> 37:43.953
- It's our lunch hour.
- Thanks.

37:45.322 --> 37:46.799
I got everyone up at the network

37:46.823 --> 37:48.791
very excited over Professor Levy.

37:49.242 --> 37:52.041
Yes, well, I have some great
stuff to show you later.

37:52.329 --> 37:53.501
Listen,

37:54.414 --> 37:56.132
I brought you a present.

37:57.626 --> 38:00.550
Great. Now I can get rid of my
few remaining teeth.

38:01.630 --> 38:04.692
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

38:04.716 --> 38:07.445
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

38:07.469 --> 38:08.780
Ta-da!

38:08.804 --> 38:09.947
Look at his face.

38:09.971 --> 38:11.616
- A treadmill.
- Yeah.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.576
Just what I need.
You trying to tell me something?

38:13.600 --> 38:14.994
You said you were bored
with the bicycle.

38:15.018 --> 38:17.455
I'm afraid you're gonna find
this just as boring, though.

38:17.479 --> 38:19.082
Well, I think you're in
great shape already.

38:19.106 --> 38:20.291
Yeah, for a man my age.

38:20.315 --> 38:22.043
- That's exactly what I was gonna say.
- Thank you.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.670
Oh, it's great to see you enjoy yourself.
You've been so depressed lately.

38:24.694 --> 38:26.964
This thing's great for tension,
you know, relieving tension.

38:26.988 --> 38:28.424
I'll go get it.

38:28.448 --> 38:29.838
Well, it's just like
the one at the club.

38:29.862 --> 38:30.259
Uh-huh.

38:30.283 --> 38:31.017
Burning calories.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.720
The one you saw that
you liked, remember?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.097
Where are we gonna put this?

38:34.121 --> 38:35.841
I'm gonna have some
20 men take it upstairs.

38:36.269 --> 38:37.269
Your weight.

38:37.293 --> 38:39.060
It looks like a piece
of kinetic sculpture.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.520
No, no, it's not
gonna stay down here.

38:40.544 --> 38:42.271
It tells you, uh, you know,
how many calories...

38:42.295 --> 38:43.815
Dad, Dad, it's for you.

38:43.839 --> 38:45.056
Miss Paley.

38:45.382 --> 38:46.442
Oh.

38:46.466 --> 38:47.819
Uh, she's a patient.

38:47.843 --> 38:49.323
Oh, on this phone?

38:49.344 --> 38:51.697
Uh, yeah. She's going through a crisis.
I'll... I'll be back.

38:51.721 --> 38:53.491
Hey, you don't...
You don't need a manual for this.

38:53.515 --> 38:54.742
What's the matter with the service?

38:54.766 --> 38:57.086
- Why couldn't the service pick it up?
- ...I can use this.

38:57.519 --> 38:59.080
I'm calling from the gas station

38:59.104 --> 39:01.207
down the road from your house.

39:01.231 --> 39:03.233
I can be there in five minutes.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.076
I'm going to,

39:05.485 --> 39:07.863
unless you meet me here,
right now.

39:08.530 --> 39:11.534
No, Judah. No, Judah.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.180
No.
I wanna talk to you in person,

39:16.204 --> 39:17.956
or I'm coming over.

39:34.848 --> 39:36.200
Just calm down, okay?

39:36.224 --> 39:37.994
You keep saying
we're going away.

39:38.018 --> 39:39.704
I want to be alone with you.

39:39.728 --> 39:41.789
And when we get back,
I want you to bring everything

39:41.813 --> 39:43.749
to a conclusion with Miriam.

39:43.773 --> 39:44.335
Now, listen.

39:44.359 --> 39:46.627
I can't go on like this.
I can't wait forever!

39:46.651 --> 39:48.880
- Del, listen, now, maybe...
- You don't know what it's like!

39:48.904 --> 39:50.673
Maybe it would help
if you talked to somebody.

39:50.697 --> 39:52.884
I mean, like,
like a therapist or somebody.

39:52.908 --> 39:54.677
- Don't trick me, Judah!
- I'm...

39:54.701 --> 39:56.453
Christ, I'm shaking.

39:58.747 --> 39:59.999
Listen...

40:01.458 --> 40:03.506
I brought you a birthday present.

40:04.377 --> 40:06.755
I know how much you love Schubert.

40:20.435 --> 40:22.371
<i>Sometimes,
when there's real love</i>

40:22.395 --> 40:25.541
<i>and true acknowledgment
of a mistake,</i>

40:25.565 --> 40:28.159
<i>there can be, uh, forgiveness, too.</i>

40:29.402 --> 40:32.656
<i>I know Miriam.
Her values, her feelings,</i>

40:33.782 --> 40:35.426
<i>Her place among
our friends and colleagues.</i>

40:35.450 --> 40:36.677
<i>But what choice do you have</i>

40:36.701 --> 40:38.554
<i>if the woman is going to tell her?</i>

40:38.578 --> 40:41.182
<i>You have to confess the wrong</i>

40:41.206 --> 40:43.267
<i>and hope for understanding.</i>

40:43.291 --> 40:46.103
<i>I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart</i>

40:46.127 --> 40:48.773
<i>a moral structure with real meaning</i>

40:48.797 --> 40:51.275
<i>and forgiveness</i>

40:51.299 --> 40:52.818
<i>and some kind of higher power.</i>

40:52.842 --> 40:55.641
<i>Otherwise, there's no basis
to know how to live.</i>

40:56.346 --> 40:57.866
<i>And I know you well
enough to know that</i>

40:57.889 --> 41:00.984
<i>a spark of that notion
is inside you somewhere, too.</i>

41:07.190 --> 41:09.693
Could you really
go through with it?

41:12.279 --> 41:14.077
What choice do I have, Ben?

41:14.823 --> 41:16.040
Tell me.

41:17.158 --> 41:20.287
Give the people that you've
hurt a chance to forgive you.

41:21.204 --> 41:22.956
Miriam won't forgive me.

41:23.832 --> 41:25.505
She'll be broken.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.510
She worships me.

41:28.628 --> 41:30.356
She'll be humiliated
before our friends.

41:30.380 --> 41:32.724
This woman plans to make a stink.

41:34.676 --> 41:36.779
Did you make promises to her?

41:36.803 --> 41:37.850
No.

41:38.847 --> 41:40.724
Maybe I led her on
more than I realized.

41:41.016 --> 41:43.860
She... She's so emotionally hungry.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.206
But it's deeper than
just Miriam, now.

41:47.230 --> 41:49.528
Meaning financial improprieties?

41:50.108 --> 41:51.155
No.

41:52.485 --> 41:53.828
Maybe I...

41:54.529 --> 41:57.032
Maybe I did make some
questionable moves.

42:01.786 --> 42:04.223
Only you would know that, Judah.

42:04.247 --> 42:06.045
I don't anymore, Ben.

42:07.626 --> 42:10.550
Sometimes it's worse than...
Worse than jail.

42:12.589 --> 42:14.262
It's a human life.

42:15.884 --> 42:17.886
You don't think God sees?

42:20.055 --> 42:22.283
God is a luxury I can't afford.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.526
Now you're talking like
your brother Jack.

42:26.561 --> 42:28.734
Jack lives in the real world.

42:29.189 --> 42:31.567
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

42:33.068 --> 42:35.867
I managed to keep free
of that real world, but

42:36.196 --> 42:38.290
suddenly, it's found me.

42:39.074 --> 42:40.801
You fool around with
her for your pleasure,

42:40.825 --> 42:43.137
and then when you
think it's enough,

42:43.161 --> 42:45.084
you want to sweep her
under the rug?

42:46.581 --> 42:48.925
There's no other solution
but Jack's, Ben.

42:50.627 --> 42:53.756
I push one button,
and I can sleep again nights.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.882
Could you sleep with that?

42:57.133 --> 42:59.181
- No.
- Is that who you really are?

43:01.429 --> 43:04.524
I will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

43:07.227 --> 43:08.945
But the law, Judah.

43:10.563 --> 43:12.986
Without the law, it's all darkness.

43:15.110 --> 43:17.158
You sound like my father.

43:17.779 --> 43:19.048
What good is the law

43:19.072 --> 43:21.951
if it prevents me from
receiving justice?

43:22.992 --> 43:25.137
<i>Is what she's doing to me just?</i>

43:25.161 --> 43:27.038
<i>Is this what I deserve?</i>

43:39.759 --> 43:41.727
Jack? It's Judah.

43:43.972 --> 43:46.691
I think we should move ahead
with what we discussed.

43:48.643 --> 43:50.566
How much will you need?

44:12.542 --> 44:14.186
Not funny.
It's not funny, guys.

44:14.210 --> 44:16.355
No, it's not. It's not, not funny.
You're not thinking funny.

44:16.379 --> 44:18.441
You got to think with your ear.
You know what I'm saying?

44:18.465 --> 44:20.317
Do... Do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

44:20.341 --> 44:22.945
Look, here's the difference.
It's very easy, very easy.

44:22.969 --> 44:25.518
If it bends, it's funny.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.825
If it breaks, it's not funny.

44:27.849 --> 44:29.849
It's very simple. Wait a minute.

44:29.851 --> 44:32.695
Here, wait a minute.
Jeff, this is Alva.

44:32.937 --> 44:34.165
Hi, pleased to meet you.

44:34.189 --> 44:35.541
Don't... Don't shoot this part.

44:35.565 --> 44:36.908
Don't, don't, hey.

44:37.609 --> 44:40.004
Alva's gonna play a small
part in the, uh, new series.

44:40.028 --> 44:42.465
I don't know what she's gonna
do, but I just know I want her.

44:42.489 --> 44:43.924
- It's wonderful. You look great.
- Thank you.

44:43.948 --> 44:45.029
- It's wonderful.
- Thank you.

44:45.033 --> 44:47.752
Trust me, they love you.
Wonderful. Be right out.

44:48.036 --> 44:49.180
All right, okay.

44:49.204 --> 44:50.681
Don't do that while
he's shooting. Don't.

44:50.705 --> 44:52.433
It's messing my hair up.

44:52.457 --> 44:53.934
All right, now, you
understand what I'm saying?

44:53.958 --> 44:55.186
- No.
- Think of Oedipus.

44:55.210 --> 44:57.897
Oedipus is funny. Oedipus...
That's the structure of funny

44:57.921 --> 44:58.981
right there.

44:59.005 --> 45:00.524
"Who did this terrible
thing to our city?

45:00.548 --> 45:02.193
"Oh, my God, it was me."
That's funny.

45:02.217 --> 45:04.028
See, but the difference is one...

45:04.052 --> 45:05.529
Don't do it while they're shooting!

45:05.553 --> 45:07.271
What the hell are you doing?

45:09.224 --> 45:10.951
<i>You will notice</i>

45:10.975 --> 45:13.945
<i>that what we are aiming at</i>

45:14.395 --> 45:17.945
<i>when we fall in love is
a very strange paradox.</i>

45:18.399 --> 45:20.711
<i>The paradox consists of the fact</i>

45:20.735 --> 45:22.737
<i>that when we fall in love,</i>

45:22.904 --> 45:25.703
<i>we are seeking to re-find</i>

45:26.407 --> 45:28.956
<i>all or some of the people</i>

45:29.077 --> 45:31.580
<i>to whom we were
attached as children.</i>

45:32.080 --> 45:33.432
<i>On the other hand,</i>

45:33.456 --> 45:35.458
<i>we ask our beloved</i>

45:35.917 --> 45:38.670
<i>to correct all of the wrongs</i>

45:39.295 --> 45:41.732
<i>that these early parents</i>

45:41.756 --> 45:44.384
<i>or siblings inflicted on upon us,</i>

45:44.717 --> 45:47.766
<i>so that love contains in
it the contradiction,</i>

45:48.096 --> 45:50.440
<i>the attempt to return to the past</i>

45:50.932 --> 45:53.276
<i>and the attempt to undo the past.</i>

45:54.727 --> 45:56.914
See? No limos.
No bimbos.

45:56.938 --> 45:59.124
No, no awards or anything.
This guy is just a...

45:59.148 --> 46:01.085
You know, just a, a,
a thinker, an intellect.

46:01.109 --> 46:02.711
You know, I was just thinking.
I was thinking

46:02.735 --> 46:04.088
when you...
When you ultimately show this

46:04.112 --> 46:06.298
to the pro... Uh, the people
that make the final decision...

46:06.322 --> 46:08.092
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...l think you should emphasize

46:08.116 --> 46:09.927
his overall view of life.
I mean, 'cause it's great.

46:09.951 --> 46:11.595
It's large and life-affirming.

46:11.619 --> 46:13.472
- Well, well, I plan to.
- They love a positive statement.

46:13.496 --> 46:14.723
- Good.
- See, this is what I need, a little...

46:14.747 --> 46:17.518
A little interest in my work. A little
encouragement or something, you know.

46:17.542 --> 46:19.520
It's, uh...
Let me ask you something.

46:19.544 --> 46:22.231
<i>I got a, a bottle of
champagne as a prize.</i>

46:22.255 --> 46:25.109
It was sent to me from Paris.
I, uh, got honorable mention, you know,

46:25.133 --> 46:27.528
for a little documentary
that I did on leukemia.

46:27.552 --> 46:28.737
And, and, um.

46:28.761 --> 46:30.281
You want some champagne?

46:30.305 --> 46:30.708
I... I... I...

46:30.732 --> 46:32.074
We can open it and
celebrate or something.

46:32.098 --> 46:33.784
I never say no to
champagne or caviar.

46:33.808 --> 46:35.828
Ok, that's perfect.
I, I have no caviar, of course.

46:35.852 --> 46:38.025
I have oat bran which
is better for your heart.

46:41.107 --> 46:44.611
He was very eloquent on the subject
of love, didn't you think?

46:44.903 --> 46:48.077
Yeah. Wish I had read him
before I got married, you know?

46:48.489 --> 46:50.634
It would have saved me
a gallbladder operation.

46:50.658 --> 46:52.219
Sorry. What did you say?

46:52.243 --> 46:53.387
Nothing.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.306
You know, he wrote a
very interesting book

46:55.330 --> 46:57.308
on human relationships.

46:57.332 --> 47:00.686
He speaks very, very highly
of love at first sight.

47:00.710 --> 47:03.839
My ex-husband and I fell
in love at first sight.

47:04.005 --> 47:06.349
Maybe, I should have
taken a second look.

47:06.466 --> 47:09.653
<i>No, actually, it was...
it was my fault as much as his.</i>

47:09.677 --> 47:11.864
I noticed that you,
you still wear a wedding ring.

47:11.888 --> 47:13.240
- Uh, urn.
- Is there any reason for that?

47:13.264 --> 47:14.265
Well,

47:14.557 --> 47:17.401
I don't know. I guess I'm
just not ready to take it off.

47:18.019 --> 47:19.830
It's good, you know?
You know, it keeps me

47:19.854 --> 47:21.790
from, from getting
asked out on dates.

47:21.814 --> 47:23.854
Really, you must have had
a pretty terrible marriage

47:23.858 --> 47:25.961
if you... If you don't want to
be asked out on any dates.

47:25.985 --> 47:28.422
Well, no.
I mean, he, he was great.

47:28.446 --> 47:29.798
He was, you know, very brilliant.

47:29.822 --> 47:31.008
- He's an architect.
- Uh-huh.

47:31.032 --> 47:32.635
Real handsome and everything.

47:32.659 --> 47:35.346
But if you're gonna have an
affair, not with my best friend.

47:35.370 --> 47:37.473
- Really?
- In my four-poster bed.

47:37.497 --> 47:40.467
And they definitely didn't have
to finish all my pistachio nuts.

47:41.751 --> 47:42.895
Really?
That inconsiderate? Well,

47:42.919 --> 47:45.898
I hope it hasn't soured you
on, on marriage or men...

47:45.922 --> 47:48.108
Yeah, I can hear myself
sounding like a bore.

47:48.132 --> 47:49.759
Just the opposite.
Hello.

47:50.176 --> 47:52.599
Yeah, she's here.
How did you know?

47:53.888 --> 47:55.699
Oh, hold on one second.

47:55.723 --> 47:57.100
It's Lester.

47:58.726 --> 47:59.898
Hello.

48:00.269 --> 48:01.395
Yeah.

48:02.313 --> 48:04.315
Sure, if you want me to.

48:05.108 --> 48:07.657
Yeah, okay.
At the office at what time?

48:07.902 --> 48:09.380
- 9:00?
- 9:00?

48:09.404 --> 48:11.423
- The building will be dark.
- Okay, that's no problem.

48:11.447 --> 48:13.217
The floor is dark.
There's nobody at the office.

48:13.241 --> 48:14.301
I didn't... Didn't hear that.

48:14.325 --> 48:16.053
The office is closed.
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

48:16.077 --> 48:17.888
No, I won't forget the outline.

48:17.912 --> 48:20.391
Yeah, the office is kind
of a spooky place at 9:00.

48:20.415 --> 48:21.725
Definitely.

48:21.749 --> 48:23.686
Sure.
The hotel's even nearer.

48:23.710 --> 48:25.951
- That's... That's better for me.
- Don't go to the hotel.

48:25.962 --> 48:28.857
- What was that? Okay, room 1911. Sure.
- Hey, you...

48:28.881 --> 48:31.485
Okay.
I'll see you there. Okay.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.010
You're not gonna go
to a hotel with him.

48:33.034 --> 48:33.612
Yeah, sure.

48:33.636 --> 48:36.073
- What's the matter with you?
- It's crazy. I better go with you.

48:36.097 --> 48:38.450
- Oh, come on, don't be ridiculous.
- This guy, I know this guy.

48:38.474 --> 48:40.077
He won't be able to
take his hands off you.

48:40.101 --> 48:41.745
He'll get you in the room,
you know, and he'll...

48:41.769 --> 48:43.372
He'll read you your Miranda rights,

48:43.396 --> 48:45.124
- and he'll tear your clothes off.
- No, he's interested

48:45.148 --> 48:46.792
in producing something of mine.

48:46.816 --> 48:48.252
- Your first child.
- Oh, God.

48:48.276 --> 48:50.170
Listen, I've never
been seduced by a guy

48:50.194 --> 48:51.922
who wears loafers and no socks.

48:51.946 --> 48:53.882
Much less one who says "nucular."

48:53.906 --> 48:55.783
And he also says "foilage."

48:55.950 --> 48:57.720
- I don't like it.
- What are you doing with a copy

48:57.744 --> 48:59.430
<i>of Singin' in the Rain?</i>

48:59.454 --> 49:02.099
It's... It's the one
print that I own.

49:02.123 --> 49:03.934
It's a...
It's a very good 16 mm print.

49:03.958 --> 49:05.644
- I play it every couple of months...
- Gosh.

49:05.668 --> 49:07.187
To get my spirits up.

49:07.211 --> 49:08.439
You know, I, I, I saw it

49:08.463 --> 49:11.150
years... I don't know how many
years ago. I remember loving it.

49:11.174 --> 49:13.861
Oh, they play it on
television very, uh, very frequently.

49:13.885 --> 49:14.945
It's wonderful.
You want to watch it?

49:14.969 --> 49:16.071
You know, 'cause I could...

49:16.095 --> 49:17.156
I could play it on this thing,
reel by reel.

49:17.180 --> 49:19.283
- Really? Don't you have some...
- Yeah. You want to have dinner?

49:19.307 --> 49:21.326
- Anything to do right now?
- No, no.

49:21.350 --> 49:24.079
And, you know,
you got till 9:00. I, uh, I...

49:24.103 --> 49:25.539
You know, why not, well,

49:25.563 --> 49:27.458
there's an Indian restaurant
right near. I'll send out.

49:27.482 --> 49:29.234
You know, we could...

49:29.400 --> 49:30.401
You know.

49:31.652 --> 49:34.997
<i>All I do is dream of you
the whole night through</i>

49:35.656 --> 49:38.135
<i>With the dawn,
I still go on dreamin' of you</i>

49:38.159 --> 49:39.344
Mmm.

49:39.368 --> 49:41.291
I love this Indian food.

49:41.829 --> 49:42.890
It's great.

49:42.914 --> 49:44.683
You want some more tandoori mouse?

49:44.707 --> 49:46.310
Just kidding.

49:46.334 --> 49:48.062
You want some of the curry?

49:48.086 --> 49:50.305
Uh-uh. Too hot. Too hot.

49:50.838 --> 49:52.483
My... My teeth are melting.

49:52.507 --> 49:54.193
<i>Sweet content just dreamin' away</i>

49:54.217 --> 49:57.154
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

49:57.178 --> 49:58.864
<i>Morning, noon,
and night-time, too!</i>

49:58.888 --> 50:00.783
It's great, isn't it?

50:00.807 --> 50:02.809
When you see Lester later,

50:03.059 --> 50:05.162
you know, be careful 'cause

50:05.186 --> 50:08.332
this guy tells you
he wants to exchange ideas.

50:08.356 --> 50:10.859
What he wants is
to exchange fluids.

52:05.139 --> 52:06.231
Yes?

52:06.474 --> 52:08.852
<i>I have a delivery
of some flowers.</i>

52:09.018 --> 52:11.038
So, what you're
saying is Chris and you can't agree

52:11.062 --> 52:12.456
on where you want to
spend your money.

52:12.480 --> 52:13.957
We can... We can agree
on something.

52:13.981 --> 52:15.584
We talk about a lot
of different places.

52:15.608 --> 52:18.754
It's just that I told Chris and I told...
I told you before.

52:18.778 --> 52:19.278
Stanley.

52:19.298 --> 52:21.298
I want to go someplace
warm, has beaches.

52:21.322 --> 52:23.175
- Caribbean.
- But I also want to do

52:23.199 --> 52:24.259
things like maybe hike.

52:24.283 --> 52:25.956
I think we should stay out of it.

52:27.203 --> 52:28.305
You know,
I hadn't thought of Australia.

52:28.329 --> 52:30.098
- Australia?
- Oh, we don't want to go to Australia.

52:30.122 --> 52:32.142
You know, I should have
done what my friends told me.

52:32.166 --> 52:34.394
Just, just go where we wanted
to go in the first place.

52:34.418 --> 52:36.171
Where did you want to
go in the first place?

52:36.195 --> 52:37.356
We wanted to go to Italy.

52:37.380 --> 52:38.523
So, what's wrong?

52:38.547 --> 52:41.517
Dad, it's Jack.
He's on the phone.

52:41.884 --> 52:43.487
- Who?
- I don't know what happened.

52:43.511 --> 52:44.821
- We were going to go to Italy.
- Jack.

52:44.845 --> 52:47.074
- Well, go to Venice.
- I thought we had it all decided.

52:47.098 --> 52:49.159
- Italy is a wonderful place.
- Italy will be all right.

52:49.183 --> 52:50.744
We can have sun.
We can have snow.

52:50.768 --> 52:51.995
We could have everything we want.

52:52.019 --> 52:53.997
Well, you could get snow, I guess.

52:54.021 --> 52:55.582
All my friends have
come back from, you know...

52:55.606 --> 52:57.167
- A lot of my friends have gone to Italy.
- What?

52:57.191 --> 52:58.312
You're not going to go there

52:58.317 --> 52:59.711
- because all your friends have been there?
- No.

52:59.735 --> 53:02.005
I just wanted you to know
everything came out fine.

53:02.029 --> 53:03.715
It's over and done with.

53:03.739 --> 53:06.037
No problems.
So you can forget about it.

53:06.534 --> 53:07.877
Oh, my God.

53:09.495 --> 53:10.872
Oh, my God.

53:11.664 --> 53:13.382
I'm in shock, Jack.

53:14.375 --> 53:15.769
Judah, I'm telling you,

53:15.793 --> 53:18.272
it's like the whole
thing never existed.

53:18.296 --> 53:21.391
It's a small burglary,
nothing more.

53:22.717 --> 53:24.444
So go on back to your life

53:24.468 --> 53:26.266
and, uh, put it behind you.

53:28.222 --> 53:29.724
I can't speak. I'm...

53:30.891 --> 53:32.452
I need a drink.

53:32.476 --> 53:33.693
Jack...

53:35.771 --> 53:38.194
What am I gonna do?
I've got guests here now.

53:44.572 --> 53:45.744
Jack,

53:46.699 --> 53:48.747
God have mercy on us, Jack.

54:30.868 --> 54:32.804
Mom, you told me
that Mary went...

54:32.828 --> 54:34.097
Has been having acupuncture.

54:34.121 --> 54:35.140
Yeah, she's tried it.

54:35.164 --> 54:37.559
Yeah, she's... I think she's been
going for the last few months.

54:37.583 --> 54:38.852
She hasn't gone back.
She stopped.

54:38.876 --> 54:41.117
- She hasn't gone back?
- Is everything okay, sweetheart?

54:42.380 --> 54:43.648
You look kind of upset.

54:43.672 --> 54:45.424
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just Jack.

54:46.133 --> 54:48.195
She's still wearing that
collar when she drives.

54:48.219 --> 54:50.280
She's, you know, she can't
look around or anything. So...

54:50.304 --> 54:52.491
I know,
but it's gotta hurt a lot.

54:52.515 --> 54:54.159
I think I'd just consider
trying it, too.

54:54.183 --> 54:56.161
We were talking
about, uh, oriental medicine.

54:56.185 --> 54:59.289
Now, I have a friend
who consulted a Chinese physician

54:59.313 --> 55:00.957
with an eye problem.

55:00.981 --> 55:03.710
And he inserted a cat's
whisker into her tear duct.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.577
She's been telling this
story all week long.

55:06.737 --> 55:07.881
She's loves this story.
It's her favorite story.

55:07.905 --> 55:09.007
Yeah, and what happened?

55:09.031 --> 55:10.258
- Well, it cured it.
- It did?

55:10.282 --> 55:11.385
It did.

55:11.409 --> 55:14.304
But you told me also
he, uh, he uses wires, too.

55:14.328 --> 55:15.680
Well, because
why would you use...

55:15.704 --> 55:17.182
Acupuncture,
you use needles. Not wires.

55:17.206 --> 55:18.975
But very fine,
almost like, almost...

55:18.999 --> 55:20.143
<i>Yeah, but that's
a different procedure.</i>

55:20.167 --> 55:21.186
<i>It's for something else.</i>

55:21.210 --> 55:23.087
<i>What do you think, Judah?</i>

55:24.213 --> 55:25.385
Judah?

55:26.215 --> 55:28.263
Judah, what do you think, hmm?

55:28.509 --> 55:32.309
I think I've done a,
a terrible thing.

55:33.180 --> 55:34.853
What's wrong, honey?

55:36.267 --> 55:37.393
I...

55:38.227 --> 55:39.746
I left these papers at the office

55:39.770 --> 55:41.665
which I absolutely need tonight.

55:41.689 --> 55:42.833
Look, sweetheart, don't...

55:42.857 --> 55:45.085
I can't believe I did this.
How negligent of me.

55:45.109 --> 55:46.711
I've never done this before.

55:46.735 --> 55:48.755
I've got this major conference
first thing in the morning,

55:48.779 --> 55:50.841
- and I left these papers there.
- No, darling, you're not gonna go

55:50.865 --> 55:52.259
- and get them tonight.
- I have to get them tonight...

55:52.283 --> 55:53.343
You can go and get
them in the morning.

55:53.367 --> 55:54.511
Because I got an
hour's work to do.

55:54.535 --> 55:56.221
Yeah, but we're in the middle
of a dinner party.

55:56.245 --> 55:59.099
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.
I, I, I, I...

55:59.123 --> 56:01.017
- Don't apologize.
- Yeah, I don't like you driving.

56:01.041 --> 56:02.519
I don't like him driving at night.

56:02.543 --> 56:03.687
- It worries me.
- Well, Chris can...

56:03.711 --> 56:05.964
Stanley, I'm so sorry about this.

56:07.965 --> 56:10.402
- Would you like some company?
- No, no, not at all.

56:10.426 --> 56:12.779
Darling, forgive me,
but I must leave.

56:12.803 --> 56:14.698
- Honey, Chris, will take you.
- It was a wonderful evening.

56:14.722 --> 56:17.145
- I enjoyed it so much.
- Oh, it was wonderful.

56:17.475 --> 56:18.577
Thank you.

56:18.601 --> 56:20.495
Oh, don't... Don't worry about us.
No, we're fine.

56:20.519 --> 56:22.998
I do apologize.
We couldn't apologize more.

56:23.022 --> 56:25.459
Let's just finish the coffee,
sit down, and he'll be back.

56:25.483 --> 56:26.860
Well, you know, it's late.

58:37.948 --> 58:39.700
<i>I'll say it once again.</i>

58:40.326 --> 58:42.545
The eyes of God see all.

58:43.871 --> 58:45.015
Listen to me, Judah.

58:45.039 --> 58:48.509
There is absolutely nothing
that escapes his sight.

58:48.709 --> 58:51.896
He sees the righteous,
and he sees the wicked.

58:51.920 --> 58:54.139
And the righteous will be rewarded,

58:54.465 --> 58:58.811
but the wicked will be
punished for eternity.

01:00:23.303 --> 01:00:24.475
Hello?

01:00:25.639 --> 01:00:26.811
Hello?

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:29.985
Hello? Hello?

01:01:03.302 --> 01:01:04.821
I want your opinion on this.

01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:06.823
We're doing a special
show on jazz, here.

01:01:06.847 --> 01:01:09.200
I'd really like to know what you think.
I admire her opinions, so.

01:01:09.224 --> 01:01:11.870
Did you tell him I want to... I want
to get involved in producing that idea

01:01:11.894 --> 01:01:13.121
- you have for a series?
- No.

01:01:13.145 --> 01:01:14.330
Oh, it's wonderful, it's great.

01:01:14.354 --> 01:01:17.000
She wants to do a different
Chekhov story every month.

01:01:17.024 --> 01:01:18.543
The guy wrote a million of them.

01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:19.836
It's very sweet of you.

01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.671
Well, I told you I'm
putty in your hands.

01:01:21.695 --> 01:01:23.465
What am I gonna do
with a handful of putty?

01:01:23.489 --> 01:01:25.508
Look at her. She's always
got a zinger. Isn't that great?

01:01:25.532 --> 01:01:27.594
This vixen, this minx.

01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:29.387
We should really
be going, shouldn't we?

01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:32.056
'Cause we have to pick up those
air sick bags and something else.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.475
I, uh, well,
we really do have to go.

01:01:33.499 --> 01:01:35.477
I've got to get up at dawn
and teach Emily Dickinson

01:01:35.501 --> 01:01:37.645
to a bunch of upper
middle-class crack addicts.

01:01:37.669 --> 01:01:39.397
One of my favorite poets.

01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:40.648
Me, too.

01:01:40.672 --> 01:01:42.901
"Because I could
not stop for death..."

01:01:42.925 --> 01:01:44.569
"He kindly stopped for me"

01:01:44.593 --> 01:01:46.061
The word "kindly," right?

01:01:46.386 --> 01:01:49.811
"The carriage held
but just ourselves and immortality

01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:52.660
"We slowly drove,
he knew no haste

01:01:52.684 --> 01:01:55.288
"and I had put away
my labor and my leisure, too

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.623
"for his civility"

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:58.708
Lester was a great
English student in college.

01:01:58.732 --> 01:02:00.251
Not that I graduated.

01:02:00.275 --> 01:02:02.378
I mean, it's...
It's amazing. I couldn't graduate,

01:02:02.402 --> 01:02:06.216
and the same school now teaches
a course in existential motifs

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.509
in my situation comedies.

01:02:07.533 --> 01:02:09.260
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:09.284 --> 01:02:10.595
Where'd you go to college, Halley?

01:02:10.619 --> 01:02:11.679
Columbia.

01:02:11.703 --> 01:02:14.682
You went to Columbia. What, uh,
what'd you... What's! you major in?

01:02:14.706 --> 01:02:17.560
Law. I... I graduated
from the law school.

01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:19.145
- You didn't practice?
- Yes, I did.

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:22.764
I, uh, but then, you know I...
I met my husband and

01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:24.776
we moved to Europe for a while.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.098
It's a long, boring story, but...

01:02:27.261 --> 01:02:29.434
I wish you'd go back
to your old job.

01:02:29.596 --> 01:02:31.616
I used to edit
newsreel footage, so,

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.910
you know, floods,
and fires and famines

01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:35.912
and, uh, it's depressing.

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:37.622
Listen, we don't all
have to go, you know.

01:02:37.646 --> 01:02:38.998
Oh, no. I do.

01:02:39.022 --> 01:02:40.458
You know what?
I'll tell you what. We'll go,

01:02:40.482 --> 01:02:43.044
and why don't you two stay, and you
have business to talk over, right?

01:02:43.068 --> 01:02:44.420
I could go with you, if you like.

01:02:44.444 --> 01:02:45.588
Let's just go. Okay?

01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:47.590
Why don't... Why don't
we go someplace quiet for a drink?

01:02:47.614 --> 01:02:49.259
I wouldn't mind that.
It's fine.

01:02:49.283 --> 01:02:51.135
I'm... I'm just exhausted.

01:02:51.159 --> 01:02:52.512
From what? It's early.

01:02:52.536 --> 01:02:53.721
Some other time.

01:02:53.745 --> 01:02:54.889
Come on, one little drink.

01:02:54.913 --> 01:02:56.790
Really. Some other time.

01:02:58.458 --> 01:03:01.312
Jesus, Lester was
so pushy tonight, you know.

01:03:01.336 --> 01:03:02.939
He comes on with Halley

01:03:02.963 --> 01:03:04.649
like it's business,
but he's after her.

01:03:04.673 --> 01:03:06.317
Oh, please,
what are you talking about?

01:03:06.341 --> 01:03:07.652
She really likes him.
I can tell.

01:03:07.676 --> 01:03:09.821
Oh, you've got to be kidding.
You tell me she likes him?

01:03:09.845 --> 01:03:11.072
What, kidding?
What's not to like?

01:03:11.096 --> 01:03:12.866
What, you think I'm crazy?
He's, he's attractive,

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:14.450
he's, he's rich.
He's the most charming man.

01:03:14.474 --> 01:03:15.785
He's your brother is what he is.

01:03:15.809 --> 01:03:17.954
You know, you're prejudiced.
She put him down pretty good

01:03:17.978 --> 01:03:19.247
when he said,
"Let's go have a drink."

01:03:19.271 --> 01:03:20.498
She said, "Some other time."
I loved that.

01:03:20.522 --> 01:03:21.957
- Oh, come on.
- The way she said, "Some other time."

01:03:21.981 --> 01:03:22.981
Just socked it right to him.

01:03:23.005 --> 01:03:24.586
All right. Oh, fine,
fine, you made your...

01:03:24.610 --> 01:03:26.087
- Some other time.
- Yes, enough already. That's enough.

01:03:26.111 --> 01:03:28.172
That was pretty witty.
What makes you think she likes him?

01:03:28.196 --> 01:03:29.424
- That's so annoying.
- What makes me...

01:03:29.448 --> 01:03:31.676
Didn't you see the way
she was staring at him all night?

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:32.969
She was staring at him all night.

01:03:32.993 --> 01:03:34.596
She probably can't believe her eyes.
I stare at the guy.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.890
No, come on.
You wouldn't pick up on those things

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:37.974
if they hit you over the head.

01:03:37.998 --> 01:03:40.351
You're not the least bit
romantic, and that's the problem.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:43.730
Hey, honey, you're the one who
stopped sleeping with me, okay?

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.607
It'll be a year come April 20th.

01:03:45.631 --> 01:03:48.318
I remember the date exactly
'cause it was Hitler's birthday.

01:03:48.342 --> 01:03:49.527
I'm not discussing that anymore.

01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:50.987
I don't want to talk
about it, all right?

01:03:51.011 --> 01:03:52.405
It's just enough about that.
Meantime, I'll bet you,

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:53.990
she's out having a drink
with him right now.

01:03:54.014 --> 01:03:55.033
For how much?

01:03:55.057 --> 01:03:57.118
For how... I'm serious.
For how much, huh?

01:03:57.142 --> 01:03:58.985
You really know how to get my goat.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:26.968
Hi, it's Clifford.

01:04:27.547 --> 01:04:28.608
Yes, I... I...

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:31.027
I knew you'd be in.
I just... I just wanted, you know...

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:32.362
Tonight was a lot of fun.

01:04:32.386 --> 01:04:34.514
Wasn't Lester so silly?

01:04:34.805 --> 01:04:37.533
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

01:04:37.557 --> 01:04:40.936
The guy presses. I was... I was
frankly embarrassed for him.

01:04:43.522 --> 01:04:46.321
What is he doing there?

01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:52.740
What do you mean, you're talking
business at 12:00 midnight?

01:04:54.366 --> 01:04:55.367
Well...

01:04:55.575 --> 01:04:57.053
Gee, that could be very dangerous.

01:04:57.077 --> 01:04:59.626
You, you want me to...
You want me to come over?

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:05.920
Oh, okay, if you, you...
if you can handle it.

01:05:07.629 --> 01:05:10.758
Okay. Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:05:19.266 --> 01:05:21.202
I'm completely in love with Halley,

01:05:21.226 --> 01:05:23.871
and Lester is starting
to make his move. I can see it.

01:05:23.895 --> 01:05:26.749
And he, he wants it just
for conquest. I can tell.

01:05:26.773 --> 01:05:29.293
You know, it's so shallow
and I'm crazy about her.

01:05:29.317 --> 01:05:31.838
You know, and how can I compete
with the guy because he's rich

01:05:31.862 --> 01:05:33.840
- and he's famous, he's successful.
- Oh, come on,

01:05:33.864 --> 01:05:35.758
he's no competition for you.

01:05:35.782 --> 01:05:37.927
Oh, God bless you for saying
that, sweetheart, really.

01:05:37.951 --> 01:05:39.887
You know, but you'll find
as you go through life

01:05:39.911 --> 01:05:42.890
that, that great depth
and, and smoldering sensuality

01:05:42.914 --> 01:05:45.309
does not always win.
I'm sorry to say.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.562
Meanwhile, his brother Ben,
you know, Ben the rabbi?

01:05:47.586 --> 01:05:49.313
He's a wonderful guy.

01:05:49.337 --> 01:05:51.607
The poor guy called me last night.
He's going blind.

01:05:51.631 --> 01:05:53.401
He's got a terrible eye disease

01:05:53.425 --> 01:05:54.694
and he's losing his sight.

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.404
He's gonna be blind in
another few months.

01:05:56.428 --> 01:05:59.147
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

01:06:00.599 --> 01:06:02.442
All right. Look left.

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:04.983
Now, straight ahead, Ben.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:09.358
Now, to the right.

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:11.652
That's good.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.161
My mother said

01:06:21.953 --> 01:06:23.639
that I should go to the doctor.

01:06:23.663 --> 01:06:24.932
Uh-huh.

01:06:24.956 --> 01:06:27.560
'Cause I was, you know,
my eyes weren't so good.

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:30.521
- Well, you're an ophthalmologist.
- Yeah.

01:06:30.545 --> 01:06:33.733
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:35.651
Well, I believe they're windows,

01:06:35.675 --> 01:06:37.769
but I'm not sure it's
the soul they see.

01:06:37.969 --> 01:06:40.188
My mother taught me I have a soul.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:43.608
And it will live on after
me when I'm gone.

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.736
And if you look deeply
enough in my eyes,

01:06:47.062 --> 01:06:48.609
you can see it.

01:06:49.356 --> 01:06:50.357
Hmm.

01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:54.448
<i>So what's the verdict?</i>

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:58.744
Look, I'd like to get this resolved
before my daughter's wedding.

01:07:00.534 --> 01:07:02.303
Judy is getting married?

01:07:02.327 --> 01:07:04.546
Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

01:07:04.746 --> 01:07:06.516
Remember, she was just a baby?

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:08.213
Well, yours, too.

01:07:10.043 --> 01:07:11.044
Yes.

01:07:11.545 --> 01:07:13.189
Are you okay, Judah?

01:07:13.213 --> 01:07:14.941
- Oh, yeah.
- You don't look so good.

01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:18.139
I'm fine. I, I just haven't
been sleeping that well.

01:07:18.885 --> 01:07:21.239
Tell me, if I'm not prying,

01:07:21.263 --> 01:07:23.857
did you ever resolve
your personal difficulties?

01:07:24.933 --> 01:07:26.981
Uh, yes, actually, uh...

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:30.373
Resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

01:07:30.397 --> 01:07:31.740
Did she?

01:07:32.357 --> 01:07:34.780
That's wonderful.
So you got a break.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.672
Sometimes to have a
little good luck

01:07:37.696 --> 01:07:39.664
is the most brilliant plan.

01:07:40.574 --> 01:07:42.718
Judah, relax. You're white.

01:07:42.742 --> 01:07:44.679
You're gonna have a break down.
It's over.

01:07:44.703 --> 01:07:47.265
What do you expect
me to be, my old self?

01:07:47.289 --> 01:07:49.041
I jump when the phone rings.

01:07:49.749 --> 01:07:51.060
No good can come of this, Jack.

01:07:51.084 --> 01:07:53.803
Hey, don't be so guilty.
I kept you uninvolved.

01:07:53.962 --> 01:07:57.262
The guy who's responsible is gone.
He's back in New Orleans.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:59.350
It's pure evil, Jack.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.572
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

01:08:02.596 --> 01:08:03.768
I mean,

01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:07.702
he kills, you pay him,
and he, he kills again.

01:08:07.726 --> 01:08:09.444
Hey, what was your alternative?

01:08:10.562 --> 01:08:12.530
How did I get in so deep?
I...

01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:16.527
What dream was I following?

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:19.421
Judah, you said it
yourself a million times.

01:08:19.446 --> 01:08:21.540
You only go around once.

01:08:22.908 --> 01:08:25.206
Jack, I went to her place after.

01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:28.162
I had to retrieve some
incriminating things. I...

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.881
I saw her there.

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:35.254
Just staring up, an inert object.

01:08:37.296 --> 01:08:38.640
There's nothing in...

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:40.943
Behind her eyes if you
looked into them.

01:08:40.966 --> 01:08:42.810
All you saw

01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:45.184
was a black void.

01:09:21.883 --> 01:09:23.319
Can I help you?

01:09:23.343 --> 01:09:24.515
Oh, uh.

01:09:25.886 --> 01:09:28.310
I used to live in this house once.

01:09:28.723 --> 01:09:30.441
Really? When?

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:33.314
Many years ago.

01:09:35.563 --> 01:09:38.442
My brother and I used to
race through these rooms.

01:09:39.776 --> 01:09:42.171
He was a wonderful kid, my brother.

01:09:42.194 --> 01:09:44.538
We were very close in those days.

01:09:47.658 --> 01:09:50.537
My father had high hopes
for him, but it never seemed

01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:52.890
to work out for him.

01:09:52.913 --> 01:09:54.211
Oh.

01:09:57.294 --> 01:09:59.355
Would you mind if I
just take a minute?

01:09:59.379 --> 01:10:02.566
I mean, everything seems
to be flooding through me.

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:03.637
Sure.

01:10:26.072 --> 01:10:27.717
Come on, Sol, get on with it.

01:10:27.741 --> 01:10:28.867
I'm hungry.

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:30.886
- Do you mind, May?
- This is such nonsense, anyway.

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:32.972
What are you putting everyone
through this mumbo-jumbo?

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.223
Bring on the main course.

01:10:34.247 --> 01:10:37.000
I apologize for my
disrespectful sister.

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:40.646
This is the 20th century.
You have young boys sitting here.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.315
Don't fill their heads
with superstition.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.734
Oh, the intellectual.
The schoolteacher.

01:10:44.758 --> 01:10:48.279
Spare us your, your, your
Leninist philosophy just this once.

01:10:48.303 --> 01:10:50.823
What, you're afraid if you don't obey
the rules, God's gonna punish you?

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.867
He won't punish me, May.
He punishes the wicked.

01:10:52.891 --> 01:10:54.327
Oh, who? Like Hitler?

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.453
How do you say that?

01:10:55.477 --> 01:10:58.356
Six million Jews burnt to death
and he got away with it.

01:10:58.563 --> 01:11:01.863
- How did he get away with it? How?
- Come on, Sol. Open your eyes.

01:11:02.108 --> 01:11:05.504
Six million Jews and millions of
others and they got off with nothing.

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:07.173
How could human beings
do such a thing?

01:11:07.197 --> 01:11:08.790
Because might makes right.

01:11:09.157 --> 01:11:11.844
That is, until the Americans
marched in and started to...

01:11:11.868 --> 01:11:14.930
- I don't like this talk at my seder.
- Okay, okay, okay, all right.

01:11:14.954 --> 01:11:17.423
- I think this is interesting.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:20.436
You know, wait a minute.
There's this joke

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.938
about the prizefighter
who enters the ring,

01:11:22.962 --> 01:11:26.776
and his brother turns to the family
priest and says, "Father, pray for him."

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.737
And the priest said, "I will,
but if he can punch, it'll help."

01:11:29.761 --> 01:11:31.104
So, what are you saying, May?

01:11:31.429 --> 01:11:34.617
You're saying you challenge the whole
moral structure of everything?

01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:35.938
What moral structure?

01:11:36.309 --> 01:11:38.913
Is that the kind of nonsense
you use on your pupils?

01:11:38.937 --> 01:11:42.458
Do you not find human impulse
is basically decent?

01:11:42.482 --> 01:11:44.168
It's basically nothing.

01:11:44.192 --> 01:11:46.379
Such a cynic,
my sister, a nihilist.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.546
Go back to Russia.

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.870
Well, listen.
I happen to agree with May

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.135
when it comes to all
that mumbo-jumbo.

01:11:53.159 --> 01:11:54.303
How can you say that?

01:11:54.327 --> 01:11:57.171
You come to every seder,
you pray in Hebrew.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:00.518
Yes, I'm going through the
motions, just like any ritual.

01:12:00.542 --> 01:12:01.602
It's a habit.

01:12:01.626 --> 01:12:05.347
What are you saying, May? There's no
morality anywhere in the whole world?

01:12:05.505 --> 01:12:07.974
Listen, for those
who want morality, there's morality.

01:12:08.383 --> 01:12:10.361
Nothing's handed down in stones.

01:12:10.385 --> 01:12:12.696
Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.699
It's like an, an ear for music
or the talent to draw.

01:12:15.723 --> 01:12:18.327
He believes, and you can
use logic on him all day long,

01:12:18.351 --> 01:12:19.495
and he still believes.

01:12:19.519 --> 01:12:21.066
Must everything be logical?

01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:22.605
If a man

01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:24.949
commits a crime, if he...

01:12:25.525 --> 01:12:26.868
If he kills.

01:12:28.403 --> 01:12:30.756
Then one way or another,
he will be punished.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.425
If he's caught, Sol.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:35.428
If he's not caught, that which
originates from a black deed

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:36.874
will blossom in a foul manner.

01:12:37.036 --> 01:12:40.099
Eh, you're relying a little too
heavily on the Bible, Sol.

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:42.852
No, no, no, no. Whether it's the, uh,
the Old Testament or Shakespeare,

01:12:42.876 --> 01:12:44.219
murder will out.

01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:46.758
Who said anything about murder?

01:12:47.338 --> 01:12:48.339
You did.

01:12:51.217 --> 01:12:52.218
Did I?

01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:57.349
And I say, if he can do
it and get away with it,

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.938
and he chooses not to be
bothered by the ethics,

01:13:00.268 --> 01:13:01.269
then he's home free.

01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:04.443
Remember, history is
written by the winners.

01:13:04.939 --> 01:13:06.417
And if the Nazis had won,

01:13:06.441 --> 01:13:08.043
future generations would understand

01:13:08.067 --> 01:13:10.713
the story of World War
ll quite differently.

01:13:10.737 --> 01:13:12.673
Your aunt is a
brilliant woman, Judah,

01:13:12.697 --> 01:13:14.574
but she's had a very unhappy life.

01:13:15.033 --> 01:13:17.887
- And if all your faith is wrong, Sol.
- Yeah...

01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:20.598
I mean, just what if, huh?
If, hmm?

01:13:20.622 --> 01:13:23.767
Then I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:25.144
Wait a minute?

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:27.897
Are you telling me that you
prefer God to the truth?

01:13:27.921 --> 01:13:31.233
If necessary, I will always
choose God over truth.

01:13:31.257 --> 01:13:32.349
I agree with him.

01:13:33.927 --> 01:13:36.430
I say, what goes around,
comes around.

01:13:40.767 --> 01:13:43.454
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yes.

01:13:43.478 --> 01:13:45.446
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.524
- Mrs. Ames is waiting.
- Yeah.

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.284
- Any messages?
- Yeah, you got an odd one.

01:13:50.443 --> 01:13:53.797
A Detective O'Donnell called and said he
wanted to talk to you about something.

01:13:53.821 --> 01:13:55.549
Well, I tried to get
him to tell me what,

01:13:55.573 --> 01:13:57.746
but he said he only
wants to talk with you.

01:14:01.996 --> 01:14:03.766
<i>He says, murder, he says</i>

01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:06.393
<i>Every time we kiss,
he says, murder, he says</i>

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:09.230
<i>Keep it up like this
and that murder he says</i>

01:14:09.254 --> 01:14:11.632
<i>In that impossible tone</i>

01:14:11.756 --> 01:14:16.603
<i>Will bring on nobody's
murder but his own</i>

01:14:18.304 --> 01:14:20.950
That was not such a great
movie, but, but, you know, it's fun.

01:14:20.974 --> 01:14:21.975
Yeah, I liked it.

01:14:22.141 --> 01:14:24.620
I think maybe when I'm older
I wanna be an actress.

01:14:24.644 --> 01:14:26.005
I don't want you to be an actress.

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.040
I want you to be on the Supreme Court

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:29.375
or a doctor or something.

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:32.086
You know, show business
is, is dog eat dog.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.712
It's worse than dog eat dog.

01:14:33.736 --> 01:14:35.965
It's, it's dog doesn't return
other dog's phone calls.

01:14:35.989 --> 01:14:37.258
You know, which is terrible.

01:14:37.282 --> 01:14:39.385
Which reminds me,
I should really check my service.

01:14:39.409 --> 01:14:42.346
Although I don't know why. I haven't had
a message in seven years, you know?

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.682
I call up and I hear the girls
on the other end giggling.

01:14:44.706 --> 01:14:46.976
- Oh, how's Halley?
- She's great.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.227
I'm going to make my move there,

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:49.332
- I think, you know?
- Yeah.

01:14:49.335 --> 01:14:51.087
But I have this ethical dilemma
'cause I'm married.

01:14:51.296 --> 01:14:53.732
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't know about that.

01:14:53.756 --> 01:14:55.975
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

01:14:56.384 --> 01:14:59.196
Yeah, my, my heart says one thing,
my head says something else, you know?

01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:01.699
Very, very hard to get your heart
and head together in life.

01:15:01.723 --> 01:15:03.325
Let me teach you that, you know.

01:15:03.349 --> 01:15:05.101
In my case,
they're not even friendly.

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:06.311
Yes?

01:15:10.648 --> 01:15:11.649
Really?

01:15:17.697 --> 01:15:18.698
No.

01:15:21.659 --> 01:15:22.751
Okay, thank you.

01:15:26.664 --> 01:15:27.665
What's wrong?

01:15:31.252 --> 01:15:35.223
Professor Levy committed suicide.

01:15:37.091 --> 01:15:41.096
<i>But we must always remember that we,</i>

01:15:41.346 --> 01:15:43.365
<i>when we are born,</i>

01:15:43.389 --> 01:15:46.285
<i>we need a great deal of love</i>

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:49.859
<i>in order to persuade
us to stay in life.</i>

01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:52.240
<i>Once we get that love...</i>

01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:54.043
<i>it usually lasts us.</i>

01:15:54.067 --> 01:15:56.754
<i>But the universe is a
pretty cold place.</i>

01:15:56.778 --> 01:16:00.203
<i>It's we who invest it
with our feelings.</i>

01:16:00.615 --> 01:16:03.084
<i>And under certain conditions,</i>

01:16:03.451 --> 01:16:04.748
<i>we feel</i>

01:16:04.869 --> 01:16:07.088
<i>that the thing isn't
worth it anymore.</i>

01:16:07.372 --> 01:16:09.391
I came as soon as I heard.

01:16:09.415 --> 01:16:11.393
I... I thought
you might not want to be alone.

01:16:11.417 --> 01:16:13.437
Oh, God.
It's been terrible, you know.

01:16:13.461 --> 01:16:16.774
I called...
The guy was not sick at all.

01:16:16.798 --> 01:16:18.942
And he left a note, he left a
simple, little note that said,

01:16:18.966 --> 01:16:20.402
"I've gone out the window."

01:16:20.426 --> 01:16:23.405
I mean, this is a major intellectual,
and, and this is his note.

01:16:23.429 --> 01:16:24.531
"I've gone out the window."

01:16:24.555 --> 01:16:25.824
I mean, what the hell
does that mean, you know?

01:16:25.848 --> 01:16:28.410
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

01:16:28.434 --> 01:16:31.288
What... Did he...
Did he have family or anything?

01:16:31.312 --> 01:16:33.499
No. You know, they were
all killed in the war.

01:16:33.523 --> 01:16:34.792
That's what's so
strange about this.

01:16:34.816 --> 01:16:37.336
He... He's seen the worst
side of life his whole life.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.963
He always was affirmative,
always said yes to life. Yes, yes.

01:16:39.987 --> 01:16:41.256
Now, today he said, "no."

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.925
Boy, can you imagine his students?

01:16:42.949 --> 01:16:44.927
Imagine how shattered
they're gonna be?

01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:46.428
Listen, I don't know
from suicide, you know.

01:16:46.452 --> 01:16:49.431
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,
nobody committed suicide.

01:16:49.455 --> 01:16:51.016
You know, everyone was too unhappy.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.519
Boy, you know,
this will put a damper on the show.

01:16:53.543 --> 01:16:56.355
Well, I got 600,000
feet of film on this guy,

01:16:56.379 --> 01:16:58.440
and he's telling how great
life is and everything.

01:16:58.464 --> 01:16:59.692
And now, you know.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:01.097
You know, what am I gonna do?
I'll...

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.820
I'll cut it up and make
it into guitar picks.

01:17:02.844 --> 01:17:06.031
I'm just thinking, I mean,
no matter how elaborate

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:08.103
a philosophical
system you work out,

01:17:08.683 --> 01:17:09.684
in the end

01:17:10.101 --> 01:17:12.149
it's, it's gotta be incomplete.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:13.789
I've been so...

01:17:13.813 --> 01:17:15.958
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

01:17:15.982 --> 01:17:18.001
- Oh, God. I understand.
- It's really, really... It's gonna be...

01:17:18.025 --> 01:17:19.128
It's gonna be such a blow.

01:17:19.152 --> 01:17:20.995
I just thought you might
want some company.

01:17:24.198 --> 01:17:25.541
No, don't do that.

01:17:26.617 --> 01:17:29.805
It's something that I wanted
to do now for, for weeks.

01:17:29.829 --> 01:17:31.749
- I just want you to know that.
- You're married.

01:17:31.998 --> 01:17:36.186
Yes, I'm married, but, you know,
that's not going to last.

01:17:36.210 --> 01:17:37.730
I mean, you know...

01:17:37.754 --> 01:17:40.382
Well, you know,
I'm... I'm not ready.

01:17:42.717 --> 01:17:45.220
Is there something you're
not telling me? I mean...

01:17:45.553 --> 01:17:46.600
No.

01:17:46.846 --> 01:17:48.031
Is there anybody else?

01:17:48.055 --> 01:17:50.367
I mean, I just don't
want you to tell me it's Lester.

01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:52.189
It's me, it's just me.

01:17:52.685 --> 01:17:56.790
I... I... I guess I haven't
gotten over my divorce yet, you know.

01:17:56.814 --> 01:17:58.361
And also, I feel

01:17:59.025 --> 01:18:00.669
unsettled about my career.

01:18:00.693 --> 01:18:02.671
You don't know this about me
but I'm very ambitious.

01:18:02.695 --> 01:18:04.538
And, you know,
that's an area that I...

01:18:04.655 --> 01:18:06.592
You know,
I'd like to get consolidated.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:08.994
And I just feel,
you know, unsettled.

01:18:23.841 --> 01:18:25.611
Don't confuse me.

01:18:25.635 --> 01:18:27.488
I'm not trying to confuse you.

01:18:27.512 --> 01:18:28.934
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:18:30.223 --> 01:18:33.368
I better go.
I should just leave.

01:18:33.392 --> 01:18:36.705
- You just got here.
- Yeah, I know, but I... You know...

01:18:36.729 --> 01:18:39.410
- Gee, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, that's okay. It's not...

01:18:39.816 --> 01:18:43.070
I'll see you soon. I'll just...
You know, I'll be seeing you.

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:49.083
Please come in.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:52.221
Uh, we read about it in the paper.

01:18:52.245 --> 01:18:54.418
It's... It's a terrible thing.

01:18:55.206 --> 01:18:57.392
You know, she'd been coming
here for several years now.

01:18:57.416 --> 01:18:58.759
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

01:19:00.253 --> 01:19:02.051
Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

01:19:02.213 --> 01:19:04.817
The record shows that
she phoned you here

01:19:04.841 --> 01:19:07.264
- and at your home a number of times.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:19:07.927 --> 01:19:09.304
She was worried about her eyes.

01:19:09.762 --> 01:19:11.698
What was she suffering from?

01:19:11.722 --> 01:19:13.895
Nothing serious, I mean, she, um,

01:19:14.433 --> 01:19:17.079
she had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

01:19:17.103 --> 01:19:19.231
And I could never find anything
very wrong with her, but, uh...

01:19:19.438 --> 01:19:22.626
And I told her that, you know, it was
just a common occurrence.

01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:24.253
She was a hypochondriac?

01:19:24.277 --> 01:19:27.747
No, no. I wouldn't say that,
but she was concerned.

01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:30.551
And there's nothing she ever said

01:19:30.575 --> 01:19:32.386
that you think might be
relevant to the case?

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:34.458
Uh, personal life, friends?

01:19:34.871 --> 01:19:36.418
No, not really.

01:19:37.456 --> 01:19:39.083
How did she come to you?

01:19:41.294 --> 01:19:43.046
You know, I honestly can't remember.

01:19:43.462 --> 01:19:45.065
Possibly another patient.

01:19:45.089 --> 01:19:46.511
Can I get that name?

01:19:46.757 --> 01:19:49.727
Well, it was a while ago and I... I...
I treat so many patients.

01:19:50.177 --> 01:19:51.645
Might it be in your records?

01:19:52.763 --> 01:19:55.937
No, no, no. I...
I doubt it very much.

01:19:57.435 --> 01:19:59.755
- Well, I'm sorry to take up your time.
- That's all right.

01:20:00.605 --> 01:20:03.500
If you, uh, remember anything
you think might be helpful,

01:20:03.524 --> 01:20:05.117
- will you give me a call?
- Sure.

01:20:05.443 --> 01:20:06.786
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

01:20:17.371 --> 01:20:19.600
For Christ's sake, Judah,
you're having a breakdown.

01:20:19.624 --> 01:20:21.059
The police know
she phoned me a lot.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.936
I lied, but I know
they saw through it.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.897
I can't take this, Jack.
This is not for me.

01:20:24.921 --> 01:20:25.981
If you don't pull yourself together,

01:20:26.005 --> 01:20:27.107
you're gonna blow the whole thing.

01:20:27.131 --> 01:20:29.735
Well, I did it, and it's irrevocable,
and now I'm gonna pay.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:32.946
Jack, I had to fight an urge just to
make a clean breast of it to the police.

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:34.156
I want this off my mind.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.491
Listen to me, Judah,
I'm in this with you.

01:20:36.515 --> 01:20:38.869
I helped you out
and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

01:20:38.893 --> 01:20:40.746
Now, you get these
ideas about confessing

01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:42.831
and you may not care
whether you drag me down with you.

01:20:42.855 --> 01:20:45.358
But I'm telling you right now,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:20:45.858 --> 01:20:47.252
What the hell is that,
Jack, a threat?

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:49.588
Just pull yourself together and
be a man. You're in the clear.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:51.006
What, are you gonna have me
rubbed out, too?

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:52.090
Don't talk nonsense.

01:20:52.114 --> 01:20:53.467
Look, I wanna know what
you meant by that remark,

01:20:53.491 --> 01:20:54.968
"You won't let it happen."
What did you mean by that?

01:20:54.992 --> 01:20:57.512
You're my brother. You've helped me
out in the past, financially.

01:20:57.536 --> 01:21:00.098
Fine. I did you a favor
when you needed it, all right?

01:21:00.122 --> 01:21:02.267
Now all of a sudden
you get this urge to confess?

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.561
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress.

01:21:04.585 --> 01:21:07.022
Not about this. This is murder.

01:21:07.046 --> 01:21:08.732
You paid for it, I engineered it,

01:21:08.756 --> 01:21:10.975
and it's over, all right?
So forget about it!

01:21:11.842 --> 01:21:13.904
One sin leads to a deeper sin.

01:21:13.928 --> 01:21:15.364
Now you sound like Papa.

01:21:15.388 --> 01:21:18.983
Adultery, fornication,
lies, killing.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:20.535
Judah, will you shut up already?

01:21:20.559 --> 01:21:22.412
Or what? You'll have your
friends shut me up?

01:21:22.436 --> 01:21:24.734
One phone call, like
pushing a button, right?

01:22:02.143 --> 01:22:04.079
Judah, I don't know what's
wrong with you these days.

01:22:04.103 --> 01:22:05.605
You're a different person.

01:22:07.106 --> 01:22:08.949
I believe in God, Miriam.

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:11.448
I know it.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.007
Because without God,
the world is a cesspool.

01:22:15.031 --> 01:22:16.717
You've been drinking
steadily and every day.

01:22:16.741 --> 01:22:19.995
You never used to drink like this.
It's something new.

01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:21.430
God, it's hot in here.

01:22:21.454 --> 01:22:22.889
Well, maybe we should go, Dad.

01:22:22.913 --> 01:22:24.266
Don't tell me what I
should do, damn it!

01:22:24.290 --> 01:22:25.883
- Judah, will you calm down?
- Dad!

01:22:27.334 --> 01:22:28.335
What the...

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:30.397
I don't... I don't feel well.

01:22:30.421 --> 01:22:32.024
I'm gonna get a little air.

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:33.721
- Well, I...
- No, you stay here.

01:22:57.948 --> 01:22:59.968
<i>All right, look. This, uh,
this story on the homeless,</i>

01:22:59.992 --> 01:23:01.636
<i>it's too long.
I want five pages out of it.</i>

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.805
<i>Make sure he gets five
real pages out of it.</i>

01:23:03.829 --> 01:23:06.141
<i>This guy tells his secretary
to type it tighter.</i>

01:23:06.165 --> 01:23:07.809
<i>He doesn't take anything out of it.
It's stupid.</i>

01:23:07.833 --> 01:23:09.603
<i>And I want this guy,
Johansson, off the show.</i>

01:23:09.627 --> 01:23:11.480
<i>He's not funny.
He doesn't write funny, I'm sick.</i>

01:23:11.504 --> 01:23:13.982
<i>He has cancer. I'm sorry. I'll
send him flowers. He's not funny.</i>

01:23:14.006 --> 01:23:15.317
<i>I don't want him.
I want him off.</i>

01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:17.861
<i>Jesus! Doesn't anybody
know how to write funny anymore?</i>

01:23:17.885 --> 01:23:19.529
<i>I mean, what,
what am I supposed to do?</i>

01:23:19.553 --> 01:23:20.947
<i>Am I supposed to write
everything myself?</i>

01:23:20.971 --> 01:23:23.533
<i>Write it myself, direct it
myself, produce it myself?</i>

01:23:23.557 --> 01:23:24.993
<i>I can't believe this!
Look at this!</i>

01:23:25.017 --> 01:23:26.620
<i>Look at those people out there!
Look at 'em!</i>

01:23:26.644 --> 01:23:27.996
<i>Look out the window at them!</i>

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.540
<i>These people are looking
for something funny in their lives!</i>

01:23:30.564 --> 01:23:31.666
<i>They're not getting anything funny!</i>

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:32.959
<i>You're giving them straight lines!</i>

01:23:32.983 --> 01:23:34.795
<i>Their lives are
straight lines already.</i>

01:23:34.819 --> 01:23:36.219
<i>They're waiting for
something funny!</i>

01:23:54.463 --> 01:23:55.965
This is terrible.

01:23:56.507 --> 01:23:58.009
What are you doing to me?

01:23:58.717 --> 01:24:01.561
This is supposed to be the
profile of a creative mind.

01:24:01.887 --> 01:24:03.990
<i>It's very tough for a woman
in this profession.</i>

01:24:04.014 --> 01:24:05.408
<i>I mean,
men are always hitting on you.</i>

01:24:05.432 --> 01:24:07.119
<i>I can make it easier for you...</i>

01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:10.163
What is this? What is this? When did you
shoot that? When did you get that?

01:24:10.187 --> 01:24:11.665
I was lurking around the corner.

01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:14.126
I had my camera and I,
I couldn't resist. I saw you guys.

01:24:14.150 --> 01:24:16.294
<i>I don't wanna do it in
a kind of a vulgar way,</i>

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:19.381
<i>and just, uh, well, you know,
take it off from what I see here.</i>

01:24:19.405 --> 01:24:21.550
<i>I wanna find out what's
in here, so I gotta,</i>

01:24:21.574 --> 01:24:24.544
<i>you know, spend some time,
we 'II have dinner together...</i>

01:24:25.786 --> 01:24:28.431
Okay, you can step aside.
I'm taking over this film.

01:24:28.455 --> 01:24:30.809
What're you talking about?
You can't finish my film.

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:32.269
I can't?
Read your contract.

01:24:32.293 --> 01:24:33.645
You promised.

01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:35.772
Look, the idea was
to show the real me.

01:24:35.796 --> 01:24:37.276
All right, okay,
I may not be perfect.

01:24:37.298 --> 01:24:39.151
But I don't promote
values that help...

01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:41.570
That... That... Wait, let me
get your quote exactly.

01:24:41.594 --> 01:24:44.489
"That deaden the sensibilities
of a great democracy."

01:24:44.513 --> 01:24:47.200
You're fired, Cliff. You're fired!
You're out! Get out of here!

01:24:47.224 --> 01:24:48.692
Go! Thank you! Goodbye.

01:24:50.102 --> 01:24:54.278
<i>If it bends, it's funny.
If it breaks, it isn't.</i>

01:24:55.107 --> 01:24:57.252
Come on, now, don't get discouraged.

01:24:57.276 --> 01:24:59.087
You have your own personal vision.

01:24:59.111 --> 01:25:00.797
What is the guy so upset about?

01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:02.924
You'd think nobody was ever
compared to Mussolini before.

01:25:02.948 --> 01:25:06.094
God, I had no idea you were
gonna cut the film like this.

01:25:06.118 --> 01:25:08.712
I could have told you months
ago they'd never use it.

01:25:08.913 --> 01:25:11.308
They want an upbeat profile of Lester.
They like him.

01:25:11.332 --> 01:25:14.882
Yeah. Now he's gonna take it and recut it
and make himself into a saint or something.

01:25:15.002 --> 01:25:16.104
- Yeah.
- You know, Wendy's right.

01:25:16.128 --> 01:25:17.272
I'm probably jealous of him.

01:25:17.296 --> 01:25:20.400
You now, with his limos and his money and
all the women throw themselves...

01:25:20.424 --> 01:25:21.801
You have your own style.

01:25:22.009 --> 01:25:24.029
Hey, listen, marry me.
I'm serious. I'm...

01:25:24.053 --> 01:25:26.406
That's the only thing
that will satisfy me. Marry me.

01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:28.200
I'm crazy about you, you're single,

01:25:28.224 --> 01:25:29.784
and you know my marriage
is not gonna last.

01:25:29.808 --> 01:25:31.203
Look, I gotta talk to you.

01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:33.663
Can we just...
Can we sit down here for a second?

01:25:33.687 --> 01:25:36.875
I'm... I'm not joking, you know.
I'm... I'm really nuts about you.

01:25:36.899 --> 01:25:38.446
I'm going away.

01:25:41.153 --> 01:25:42.996
Yeah? Meaning what?

01:25:44.156 --> 01:25:48.787
I've got a chance to produce
a couple of shows in London,

01:25:48.994 --> 01:25:51.167
and, you know, I couldn't say no.

01:25:52.665 --> 01:25:55.088
So, how...
How long are you going for?

01:25:55.292 --> 01:25:58.011
Well, probably three
or four months.

01:25:58.170 --> 01:26:00.218
Three or four months?

01:26:00.839 --> 01:26:03.902
Jesus, you're kidding.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:06.112
What a...
What a discouraging thought.

01:26:06.136 --> 01:26:08.323
But, you know,
I think it's a good thing

01:26:08.347 --> 01:26:10.533
because I... I need...

01:26:10.557 --> 01:26:13.161
Well, it will give me
a little distance.

01:26:13.185 --> 01:26:15.830
About 3,000 miles to be exact.

01:26:15.854 --> 01:26:17.082
When are you leaving?

01:26:17.106 --> 01:26:19.734
Oh, I guess, you now,
10 days or so.

01:26:21.277 --> 01:26:24.201
God, I'm... Oh.

01:26:27.866 --> 01:26:30.595
God, I'm gonna Miss you. I...
You know what? I don't know what to say.

01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:31.871
I'm just...

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:35.166
I'm not gonna see you
for three or four months?

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:41.013
I feel like I, you know, like I've
been handed a prison sentence.

01:27:11.076 --> 01:27:13.471
Ben, your daughter will make
a beautiful bride.

01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:15.515
You know, your daughter will...

01:27:15.539 --> 01:27:18.018
This is Barbara, uh,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:19.185
- Hi.
- Carol.

01:27:19.209 --> 01:27:20.586
- Oh.
- Congratulations.

01:27:21.503 --> 01:27:23.523
I wish your daughter
all the happiness.

01:27:23.547 --> 01:27:24.548
Thank you.

01:27:24.965 --> 01:27:26.512
Oh, thank you so much.

01:27:28.802 --> 01:27:31.114
Jesus, I'm so self-conscious.

01:27:31.138 --> 01:27:33.783
You know, every single thing
on me is rented.

01:27:33.807 --> 01:27:36.703
A rented tux, rented shoes,
rented underwear.

01:27:36.727 --> 01:27:39.289
You look fine, you look terrific.
Cliff, would you do me a favor?

01:27:39.313 --> 01:27:41.791
This is the last occasion you have
to do anything with my family.

01:27:41.815 --> 01:27:43.112
Could we try to get along?

01:27:43.567 --> 01:27:46.087
Oh, and this is Dr. Rosenthal.

01:27:46.111 --> 01:27:47.422
I'm Miriam.

01:27:47.446 --> 01:27:48.548
- Hello.
- This is Miriam.

01:27:48.572 --> 01:27:50.800
And this is Marianne,
and this is Peter.

01:27:50.824 --> 01:27:52.135
- How do you do, Peter?
- How do you do?

01:27:52.159 --> 01:27:53.345
It's a pleasure meeting you.

01:27:53.369 --> 01:27:55.212
- Judah?
- Yes, Ben?

01:27:55.579 --> 01:27:58.753
Judah, I'm so glad you could make it.
It means a lot.

01:28:01.919 --> 01:28:04.939
What is the matter with you,
you seem so depressed.

01:28:04.963 --> 01:28:08.193
Wendy and I finally
decided to call it quits, you know.

01:28:08.217 --> 01:28:10.779
And even though the last couple
of years have been terrible...

01:28:10.803 --> 01:28:12.280
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...this kind of thing

01:28:12.304 --> 01:28:13.948
just makes me feel sad, you know.

01:28:13.972 --> 01:28:15.533
I'm... I'm gonna have
a vodka and tonic, please.

01:28:15.557 --> 01:28:16.785
Oh, yeah.
I'll have one of those, too.

01:28:16.809 --> 01:28:18.286
But you know what you told me?

01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:20.455
You told me it's been
platonic for a year.

01:28:20.479 --> 01:28:22.999
And I say once the
sex goes, it all goes.

01:28:23.023 --> 01:28:24.292
It's true. It's true.

01:28:24.316 --> 01:28:25.752
The last time I was inside a woman

01:28:25.776 --> 01:28:27.653
it was when I visited
the Statue of Liberty.

01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:38.223
Take a look at your father.

01:28:38.247 --> 01:28:39.767
He's celebrating enough
for two people.

01:28:40.416 --> 01:28:42.644
Yeah, well, he...
He and Ben will get high

01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:44.354
and then argue about
belief and God.

01:28:44.378 --> 01:28:46.189
My father takes after his Aunt May.

01:28:46.213 --> 01:28:48.316
You'd have loved her.
She rejected the Bible

01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:51.344
because she said it had a completely
unbelievable sense of character.

01:28:52.261 --> 01:28:53.738
I walked Â¡n, I sit.

01:28:53.762 --> 01:28:57.158
The Waldorf-Astoria, the centerpieces.
Did you see the centerpieces?

01:28:57.182 --> 01:28:58.326
It's just beautiful.

01:28:58.350 --> 01:29:00.569
Everything matches.
And Lester paid for it.

01:29:00.686 --> 01:29:03.164
It's hard to believe that a
brother would pay for a wedding.

01:29:03.188 --> 01:29:06.501
It's hard to believe but that's the
sort of thing Lester is always doing,

01:29:06.525 --> 01:29:07.627
isn't it?

01:29:07.651 --> 01:29:09.838
- He must be a good brother.
- Do you know him for a long time?

01:29:09.862 --> 01:29:12.006
Since high school.
I've known him since high school.

01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:13.031
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:29:26.211 --> 01:29:28.148
They're pretty.
They're very, very pretty.

01:29:28.172 --> 01:29:29.452
It's very square like that. See?

01:29:29.465 --> 01:29:30.650
Hi, Cliff.

01:29:30.674 --> 01:29:32.026
Cliff, hello.

01:29:32.050 --> 01:29:34.696
Lester, how are you?
Good to see you.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.000
My fiancÃ©e, Halley Reed.

01:29:36.013 --> 01:29:37.866
Congratulations.
My wife Nancy.

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:39.312
Hello, nice to meet you.

01:29:42.644 --> 01:29:44.112
When did you get back?

01:29:44.396 --> 01:29:47.459
I got back this morning.
I've been trying to call you all day.

01:29:47.483 --> 01:29:49.781
Look at this. Look at this.
I finally won her heart.

01:29:49.902 --> 01:29:51.921
What a romantic story,
you should have seen it.

01:29:51.945 --> 01:29:53.756
We ran into each other in London.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:57.250
And I sent her white
roses around the clock.

01:29:57.409 --> 01:29:59.637
All the time, for days, for days.

01:29:59.661 --> 01:30:01.347
And then I found out
she was allergic.

01:30:01.371 --> 01:30:02.515
- Hi, Lester.
- Hi.

01:30:02.539 --> 01:30:03.850
Lester, how are you?
Congratulations.

01:30:03.874 --> 01:30:05.310
Thank you. Good to see you.

01:30:05.334 --> 01:30:08.062
So I... I...
I started pleading with her.

01:30:08.086 --> 01:30:10.815
I just... I begged her.
I just begged her day and night.

01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:12.762
And I think it was the
caviar that did it.

01:30:13.008 --> 01:30:15.528
You know, I've envied...
I've envied you for years.

01:30:15.552 --> 01:30:16.863
I've envied this guy for years.

01:30:16.887 --> 01:30:19.741
I mean, he would show up with a
beautiful woman each and every time.

01:30:19.765 --> 01:30:21.743
But I... But I envy you more now.

01:30:21.767 --> 01:30:22.952
Well, now, thank you.

01:30:22.976 --> 01:30:23.977
Thank you.

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:52.173
Standing here,
in the presence of God,

01:30:52.297 --> 01:30:54.140
the guardian of our homes,

01:30:54.299 --> 01:30:57.195
ready to enter into the
bonds of wedlock,

01:30:57.219 --> 01:31:00.740
answer each of you in
reverence for God.

01:31:00.764 --> 01:31:03.910
And in the hearing of the assembly
that have gathered here

01:31:03.934 --> 01:31:06.107
so joyously with you.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:17.215
- I know the perfect guy for you.
- Who?

01:31:17.239 --> 01:31:19.467
- He's brilliant, he's attractive...
- Well, who is it?

01:31:19.491 --> 01:31:21.344
What? There's a hitch.
I'm waiting.

01:31:21.368 --> 01:31:22.971
There's a hitch, but it
sounds worse than it is.

01:31:22.995 --> 01:31:24.222
What is it? What is it?

01:31:24.246 --> 01:31:25.473
He's in prison.

01:31:25.497 --> 01:31:27.350
Rita, I would say that's a drawback.

01:31:27.374 --> 01:31:29.852
Nothing terrible.
Insider trading.

01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:31.521
- He made a fortune in the market.
- Oh, please.

01:31:31.545 --> 01:31:35.942
And he'll be out soon,
very soon, a couple of years.

01:31:35.966 --> 01:31:37.559
You mean, with good behavior.

01:31:51.607 --> 01:31:52.779
Cliff?

01:31:56.653 --> 01:31:58.621
I wanted to talk to you.

01:32:04.411 --> 01:32:05.805
What is there really to say?

01:32:05.829 --> 01:32:09.174
You know, I'm...
I'm just stunned still.

01:32:12.336 --> 01:32:13.929
He's not what you think.

01:32:15.047 --> 01:32:17.817
He's... He's wonderful, he's warm

01:32:17.841 --> 01:32:19.569
and caring

01:32:19.593 --> 01:32:22.030
and romantic.

01:32:22.054 --> 01:32:23.948
- He's a success. That's what he is.
- Oh.

01:32:23.972 --> 01:32:25.533
He's, he's rich and he's a success.

01:32:25.557 --> 01:32:27.201
Give me a little credit, will you?

01:32:27.225 --> 01:32:30.038
Well, I always did give you
a little credit until today.

01:32:30.062 --> 01:32:31.331
You know, I...

01:32:31.355 --> 01:32:34.000
We used to laugh
at this guy. You know the, uh,

01:32:34.024 --> 01:32:36.669
the silly shows he puts on,
the way he talks.

01:32:36.693 --> 01:32:37.910
He's endearing.

01:32:39.696 --> 01:32:42.666
This is my worst fear realized.

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:50.924
I wanted to give you
this letter back.

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:56.689
It's my one love letter.

01:32:56.713 --> 01:32:57.965
It's beautiful.

01:32:58.131 --> 01:33:00.680
I... I'm just the wrong person.

01:33:04.596 --> 01:33:06.348
It's probably just as well.

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.274
I plagiarized most of it
from James Joyce.

01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:16.084
You probably wondered why
all the references to Dublin.

01:33:16.108 --> 01:33:17.360
Look, I...

01:33:18.276 --> 01:33:21.621
I hope we can always be friends.

01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:31.248
Hey! Hey!

01:34:06.199 --> 01:34:07.951
Off by yourself, huh?

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:09.332
You're like me.

01:34:10.704 --> 01:34:13.548
I always get sad at
these kind of events.

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:15.792
You look very deep in thought.

01:34:18.754 --> 01:34:20.973
I was plotting the perfect murder.

01:34:22.507 --> 01:34:24.885
Yeah? Movie plot?

01:34:26.011 --> 01:34:27.388
Movie?

01:34:27.846 --> 01:34:30.867
Well, Ben, uh,
that's what Ben told me.

01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:32.609
He says you make films.

01:34:32.809 --> 01:34:34.328
Yeah, but not that kind.

01:34:34.352 --> 01:34:36.696
You know, the different kind.

01:34:38.857 --> 01:34:40.985
I have a great murder story.

01:34:42.194 --> 01:34:43.421
Yes?

01:34:43.445 --> 01:34:44.617
A great plot.

01:34:45.739 --> 01:34:47.082
Yeah.

01:34:49.159 --> 01:34:51.220
Hey, I've had too many to drink.

01:34:51.244 --> 01:34:54.874
I hope you'll forgive me.
I... I know you want your privacy.

01:34:55.207 --> 01:34:59.212
No, it's okay.
I'm not doing anything special.

01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.231
Except my murder story

01:35:02.255 --> 01:35:05.555
has a very strange twist.

01:35:06.927 --> 01:35:08.304
Yeah?

01:35:10.806 --> 01:35:14.731
Let's say there's this man who...
Who's very successful.

01:35:14.893 --> 01:35:16.395
He has everything.

01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:26.112
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

01:35:26.404 --> 01:35:27.548
Am I a phony?

01:35:27.572 --> 01:35:29.175
- Are you what?
- Am I a phony?

01:35:29.199 --> 01:35:31.552
What are you talking about?
Are you a little high or something?

01:35:31.576 --> 01:35:33.888
No, I'm... You know,
I think he hates me.

01:35:33.912 --> 01:35:35.306
- Who hates you?
- Your annoying husband.

01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:36.849
He's a...
Every time I'm with him

01:35:36.873 --> 01:35:38.559
I get tense, you know.

01:35:38.583 --> 01:35:40.061
It's just that he's angry.
You know that.

01:35:40.085 --> 01:35:41.395
Well, at what?
At what?

01:35:41.419 --> 01:35:42.647
At what?
Are you kidding me?

01:35:42.671 --> 01:35:44.774
He's got these fantasies
about changing the world.

01:35:44.798 --> 01:35:46.067
'Cause he's a man who thinks
he can change it.

01:35:46.091 --> 01:35:47.777
He makes these films,
and in the end they come to nothing.

01:35:47.801 --> 01:35:49.904
- They're nothing, these films.
- Let me tell you something, honey.

01:35:49.928 --> 01:35:51.739
He's gotta grow up.
I mean, this is the real world.

01:35:51.763 --> 01:35:54.742
This is the big time. They don't...
They don't pay off on high aspirations.

01:35:54.766 --> 01:35:56.869
- You gotta deliver, you know.
- You don't have to tell me.

01:35:56.893 --> 01:35:58.579
And not to mention the fact that...

01:35:58.603 --> 01:35:59.705
I mean, I can't believe it.

01:35:59.729 --> 01:36:00.928
You're... You're still young.

01:36:00.952 --> 01:36:03.334
You're not getting the life
that you deserve, you know.

01:36:03.358 --> 01:36:04.735
Lester, I met somebody.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.328
Oh, then... Oh.

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:10.957
- That is music to my ears.
- Yeah.

01:36:12.409 --> 01:36:14.178
And after the awful deed is done,

01:36:14.202 --> 01:36:17.957
he, he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

01:36:18.790 --> 01:36:21.964
Little sparks of his
religious background,

01:36:22.252 --> 01:36:24.004
which he'd rejected

01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:25.843
are suddenly stirred up.

01:36:27.883 --> 01:36:30.027
He hears his father's voice.

01:36:30.051 --> 01:36:34.306
He imagines that God
is watching his every move.

01:36:35.265 --> 01:36:37.535
Suddenly, it's not an
empty universe at all,

01:36:37.559 --> 01:36:39.996
but a just and moral one,

01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.864
and he's violated it.

01:36:44.357 --> 01:36:46.109
Now, he's panic-stricken.

01:36:46.776 --> 01:36:49.074
He's on the verge of
a mental collapse,

01:36:49.654 --> 01:36:53.534
an inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

01:36:54.993 --> 01:36:57.746
And then one morning,

01:36:58.330 --> 01:36:59.832
he awakens

01:37:00.832 --> 01:37:04.006
and the sun is shining
and his family is around him.

01:37:04.836 --> 01:37:08.591
Mysteriously, the crisis is lifted.

01:37:10.508 --> 01:37:12.695
He takes his family on
a vacation to Europe,

01:37:12.719 --> 01:37:16.440
and as the months pass
he finds he's not punished.

01:37:17.515 --> 01:37:19.017
In fact, he prospers.

01:37:20.018 --> 01:37:22.496
The killing gets attributed
to another person,

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:24.665
a drifter who has a number of
other murders to his credit.

01:37:24.689 --> 01:37:27.818
So, I mean, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

01:37:29.027 --> 01:37:30.779
Now he's soot-free.

01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:34.579
His life is completely
back to normal.

01:37:35.575 --> 01:37:39.876
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

01:37:40.413 --> 01:37:43.587
Uh, yes, but can he
ever really go back?

01:37:46.044 --> 01:37:49.190
Well, people carry sins
around with them.

01:37:49.214 --> 01:37:52.818
I mean, oh, maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment,

01:37:52.842 --> 01:37:54.515
but it passes.

01:37:55.303 --> 01:37:58.147
And with time, it all fades.

01:37:58.723 --> 01:38:01.160
Yeah. But, but, so then, you know,

01:38:01.184 --> 01:38:04.859
then, then his worst...
His worst beliefs are realized.

01:38:05.063 --> 01:38:07.566
Well, I said it was a
chilling story, didn't I?

01:38:09.776 --> 01:38:10.878
I don't know.

01:38:10.902 --> 01:38:13.631
It... It'd be... I think it'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

01:38:13.655 --> 01:38:16.384
You know, it's... Very few
guys could actually live,

01:38:16.408 --> 01:38:18.844
you know, to live with something
like that on their conscience.

01:38:18.868 --> 01:38:21.055
What do you mean? People carry
awful deeds around with them.

01:38:21.079 --> 01:38:23.753
What do you expect him
to do, turn himself in?

01:38:24.749 --> 01:38:26.422
I mean, this is reality.

01:38:26.793 --> 01:38:28.854
In reality, we, we rationalize.

01:38:28.878 --> 01:38:32.052
We deny or we,
we couldn't go on living.

01:38:35.635 --> 01:38:39.073
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

01:38:39.097 --> 01:38:43.077
'Cause then you see, then your
story assumes tragic proportions.

01:38:43.101 --> 01:38:45.579
Because in the absence
of a God or something,

01:38:45.603 --> 01:38:48.749
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.

01:38:48.773 --> 01:38:50.616
Then you have...
Then you have tragedy.

01:38:51.609 --> 01:38:53.504
But that's fiction, that's movies.

01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:56.532
I mean... I mean,
you've seen too many movies.

01:38:56.656 --> 01:38:58.579
I mean, I'm talking about reality.

01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:00.594
I mean, if you want a happy ending,

01:39:00.618 --> 01:39:03.121
you should go see a
Hollywood movie.

01:39:04.706 --> 01:39:06.174
Come on, darling.

01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:08.759
Let's think about going home, huh?

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.720
Nice talking to you.
Good luck to you.

01:39:11.296 --> 01:39:14.275
Miriam, we're gonna make a
wedding like this for Sharon.

01:39:14.299 --> 01:39:15.860
And I can't wait.

01:39:15.884 --> 01:39:17.386
She'll be radiant.

01:39:18.553 --> 01:39:20.698
You're looking very
handsome tonight.

01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:22.520
And you look beautiful.

01:39:46.498 --> 01:39:49.852
<i>We are all faced
throughout our lives</i>

01:39:49.876 --> 01:39:52.345
<i>with agonizing decisions,</i>

01:39:52.587 --> 01:39:54.510
<i>moral choices.</i>

01:39:54.839 --> 01:39:57.985
<i>Some are on a grand scale.</i>

01:39:58.009 --> 01:40:01.513
<i>Most of these choices
are on lesser points.</i>

01:40:02.013 --> 01:40:05.367
<i>But we define ourselves</i>

01:40:05.391 --> 01:40:08.144
<i>by the choices we have made.</i>

01:40:08.311 --> 01:40:12.737
<i>We are in fact,
the sum total of our choices.</i>

01:40:13.691 --> 01:40:17.338
<i>Events unfold, so unpredictably,</i>

01:40:17.362 --> 01:40:19.285
<i>so unfairly,</i>

01:40:19.864 --> 01:40:24.040
<i>human happiness does not
seem to have been included</i>

01:40:24.244 --> 01:40:26.463
<i>in the design of creation.</i>

01:40:26.996 --> 01:40:31.227
<i>It is only we,
with our capacity to love,</i>

01:40:31.251 --> 01:40:34.881
<i>that give meaning
to the indifferent universe.</i>

01:40:35.713 --> 01:40:38.887
<i>And yet, most human beings</i>

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:42.896
<i>seem to have the
ability to keep trying</i>

01:40:43.263 --> 01:40:47.268
<i>and even to find joy
from simple things,</i>

01:40:47.559 --> 01:40:50.358
<i>like their family,</i>

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:51.817
<i>their work,</i>

01:40:52.438 --> 01:40:54.250
<i>and from the hope</i>

01:40:54.274 --> 01:40:57.044
<i>that future generations</i>

01:40:57.068 --> 01:41:00.322
<i>might understand more.</i>
