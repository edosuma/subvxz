00:48.980 --> 00:49.930
Homer !

00:49.980 --> 00:52.310
Do something about the noise!

01:04.569 --> 01:05.690
It's 7:00 A.M.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.340
What are they cock-a-doodily doing?

01:07.470 --> 01:10.290
Flanders, I can't listen to 
your crap before my coffee.

01:10.390 --> 01:12.170
Okily-dokily, here's some french roast.

01:12.330 --> 01:13.310
Now, I'll go make toast.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.540
Stupid best friend flanders.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.060
A stamp museum?

01:21.510 --> 01:24.160
oh! Stamps?

01:24.510 --> 01:26.300
Those are for snail mail!

01:26.680 --> 01:28.050
Stamps rule!

01:28.240 --> 01:29.340
I mean suck!

01:29.380 --> 01:33.220
Well, they can't just start building 
in our neighborhood without asking us.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.820
What ever happened to "please" 
and "thank you"?

01:35.990 --> 01:37.150
I think they killed each other.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.140
You know, one of those murder-suicide deals.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.770
We have to stop all this construction.

01:43.860 --> 01:46.960
The noise is jiggling my grapes 
to the bottom of the jell-O.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.880
What man would want you now?

01:52.080 --> 01:55.520
Two, four, six, eight, I hate 
stamps, they aren't great!

01:58.030 --> 02:00.070
Okay, how about this?

02:00.310 --> 02:02.020
Seven, four, three, one...

02:02.270 --> 02:03.600
oh, wait, that's my pin number.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.720
Tell me over and over and over again my friend 

02:17.150 --> 02:17.710
Again!

02:17.840 --> 02:18.520
Again!

02:20.650 --> 02:21.250
Again!

02:23.240 --> 02:23.710
Again!

02:25.790 --> 02:26.330
That's enough.

02:37.590 --> 02:40.040
"come home from Iraq," my wife says.

02:40.130 --> 02:43.330
"Fallujah's too dangerous," my wife says.

03:01.620 --> 03:05.480
You beat those stamp nazis with good 
old-fashioned american complaining.

03:05.660 --> 03:06.820
Homer, if it weren't for you,

03:06.940 --> 03:09.200
we'd be at the mercy of weekend philatelists.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.550
You know, why didn't you just 
say "stamp collectors"?

03:11.620 --> 03:13.560
'Cause I'm tired of dumbing 
myself down for you.

03:13.740 --> 03:17.000
The postal service is sending a 
change of address card...

03:17.190 --> 03:18.170
to itself.

03:18.380 --> 03:21.540
The stamp museum will now be built on 
the site of the Springfield cemetery.

03:21.830 --> 03:24.920
The cemetery will be moved right 
here, next to the Simpsons.

03:25.150 --> 03:29.320
Oh, instead of a stamp museum, 
we'll be next door to a graveyard?

03:29.540 --> 03:30.840
Look at the bright side, Marge.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.440
When I die, you can mourn 
me from the bathroom.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.370
That's multitasking.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.060
This is a little too spooky for me.

03:41.340 --> 03:44.150
I don't even like watching 
the count on sesame street.

03:44.450 --> 03:48.700
One coconut, two coconuts, 
three coconets...

03:49.730 --> 03:51.720
Go back to your own country!

04:17.250 --> 04:18.220
This stinks.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.970
My room is the only one that 
faces that cemetery.

04:21.140 --> 04:24.120
Then the zombies will eat you first, 
and you won't have to watch them eat us.

04:24.350 --> 04:25.880
Thanks for making me feel better.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.560
Well, thanks for making me feel better,

04:27.560 --> 04:29.740
knowing that your screams when 
the zombies chomp your brains

04:29.740 --> 04:31.310
will warn me so I can get away.

04:31.420 --> 04:33.340
There's no such thing as zombies!

04:33.420 --> 04:36.080
Glad to hear you say that, 
because the person

04:36.080 --> 04:37.350
who doesn't believe in zombies

04:37.430 --> 04:39.520
is always the first to get feasted upon.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.280
Stop scaring me!

04:47.360 --> 04:49.320
Bart, don't you have homework to do?

04:49.630 --> 04:51.320
Yeah, and I could really use your help.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.770
I believe in science and reality, 
not ghosts and monsters.

05:14.770 --> 05:15.920
Can I sleep with you guys

05:15.920 --> 05:16.440
Tonight?

05:16.580 --> 05:18.510
Oh, sure you can, sweetie.

05:18.710 --> 05:20.300
Just don't make a habit of it.

05:20.460 --> 05:22.410
Okay, just let me clear some space.

05:24.470 --> 05:25.040
Off you go.

05:26.230 --> 05:26.750
You, too.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.520
So that's why I've been smelling 
margaritas at 3:00 A.M.

05:33.790 --> 05:36.040
Hey, I love waking up 
drunk in the morning.

05:46.070 --> 05:48.800
Lisa, honey, I know last night was tough, 

05:49.150 --> 05:51.530
but all our kids sleep by themselves.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.070
We don't even hear Maggie cry at night anymore.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.860
Wait a minute, there's no 
batteries in this thing.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.900
I needed them for my remote-control helicopter.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.220
Tonight, I want you to really try to sleep

06:04.220 --> 06:06.520
in your own bed, because...

06:07.200 --> 06:08.300
Homer, stop that!

06:08.530 --> 06:11.660
There's a little plastic man in your 
hair, and I'm trying to rescue him.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.630
No soldier left behind.

06:16.730 --> 06:19.230
Oh! Homer, can you help me out here?

06:20.260 --> 06:23.580
Lisa, honey, if you sleep 
in your own bed tomorrow,

06:23.580 --> 06:26.210
we'll do something special just for you.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.080
Well, I heard they finished the stamp museum.

06:29.320 --> 06:30.380
That could be fun.

06:33.540 --> 06:35.900
I can't believe it took us 
40 minutes to get here!

06:36.030 --> 06:37.610
Why can't they build a stamp museum

06:37.610 --> 06:38.950
closer to our house?

06:39.250 --> 06:42.410
Dad, you fought tooth and nail 
to get it away from our house.

06:42.930 --> 06:46.310
Lisa, when you've sustained as 
many blows to the head as I have,

06:46.510 --> 06:49.810
consistency is something, something that something...

06:49.810 --> 06:51.490
I love you, Bart.

06:56.690 --> 06:58.040
Isn't this Lenny's house?

06:58.230 --> 06:59.080
Hey, Simpsons.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.270
That'll be 40 bucks.

07:00.510 --> 07:02.160
Oh, I thought it was 20!

07:02.710 --> 07:03.750
Yeah,  that's per axle.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.470
Park over there in Carl four.

07:05.820 --> 07:06.740
No early outs.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.220
I can't believe you're 
making money off this.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.050
Living next to the stamp museum

07:12.160 --> 07:13.210
is making me a mint!

07:13.400 --> 07:15.390
I bought a diamond for my belly button!

07:16.500 --> 07:17.350
You guys need water?

07:20.120 --> 07:23.270
No one's gonna pay a buck to 
drink water from your hose, so...

07:24.330 --> 07:25.760
Pay the man, Homer.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.550
Wow!  Look at all these worthy americans.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.300
My name is Frederick Ives.

07:39.450 --> 07:42.400
I invented the halftone printing process.

07:45.060 --> 07:49.420
Thanks to me, Katherine Blodgett,
we have nonreflecting glass.

07:51.160 --> 07:52.400
Yeesh! Butter face.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.050
And I'm Alexander Graham Bell, 
inventor of the telephone.

07:56.380 --> 07:59.460
You stole it from me, Elisha Gray.

07:59.810 --> 08:01.420
Read the patent number, bitch!

08:03.360 --> 08:05.000
"The land of the wild beasts"?

08:05.340 --> 08:07.500
That's the first book I read 
all the way through.

08:07.650 --> 08:10.870
You read a book all the way through? Why?

08:11.520 --> 08:13.520
Milton burkhart's work has touched

08:13.520 --> 08:17.510
on every genre from books 
to films to advertising.

08:17.570 --> 08:19.260
All right! Commercials!

08:21.050 --> 08:25.110
Once upon a time, a bad boy was 
sent to bed without any dinner.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.160
But then, something magical happened.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.789
Is this the land of the wild beasts?

08:33.140 --> 08:36.490
No, this is the land of the wild feasts!

08:36.929 --> 08:39.260
The Hillside Wrangler steak house!

08:39.740 --> 08:42.200
I'm a $4.99 steak.

08:42.490 --> 08:44.730
I'm all-you-can-eat salad bar!

08:44.830 --> 08:46.700
Yo, and I'm sneeze guard.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.720
Put it on the glass, dawgs.

08:51.650 --> 08:53.800
And I'm jumbo shrimp!

08:54.250 --> 08:56.420
Maximum two servings!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.470
That's bull...

08:58.470 --> 08:58.880
Man!

09:04.450 --> 09:06.860
I love you, Hillside Wrangler!

09:08.600 --> 09:10.740
Tell us, Mr. Burkhart, what led you

09:10.740 --> 09:13.330
to the magical world of children's books?

09:13.430 --> 09:15.470
I wanted to be a children's 
book illustrator 

09:15.710 --> 09:20.120
ever since Playboy wouldn't 
publish my cartoons because

09:20.220 --> 09:20.610
they were too filthy.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.840
Groundskeeper Willie?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.320
No, I'm his cousin, Gravedigger Billy.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.350
I've been digging graves for 30 years,

09:40.520 --> 09:42.410
and I've never buried anyone alive.

09:42.590 --> 09:44.370
If I did, they'd ring this bell.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.520
Well, that's just the wind.

09:50.900 --> 09:52.940
Oh, that's just a tree branch,

09:53.070 --> 09:54.290
with a nice watch on it!

10:07.130 --> 10:08.950
What a lousy party!

10:09.220 --> 10:11.490
I don't care what apu was in a past life,

10:11.510 --> 10:13.770
in this life, he's a blabbermouth!

10:14.070 --> 10:17.100
And that Dr. Hibbert was so boring.

10:17.430 --> 10:19.480
"Homer, we've got to get that lump checked out."

10:19.480 --> 10:22.090
"Homer, we must discuss your test results."

10:22.430 --> 10:24.410
"Homer, we've got to find you a donor."

10:26.180 --> 10:28.070
I thought those people were your friends.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.650
Look who's sleeping in our bed again.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.470
I didn't know grownups said bad 
things about other grownups.

10:36.741 --> 10:38.997
You see, sweetie, when a mommy and daddy

10:39.021 --> 10:41.235
are married for years 
and have nothing new

10:41.259 --> 10:44.093
to talk about, they bad-mouth 
their closest friends.

10:44.527 --> 10:47.726
But I thought it was wrong to talk 
about people behind their backs.

10:48.049 --> 10:53.016
I spy with my little eye a girl who's 
not sleeping in her room like she promised.

10:53.026 --> 10:54.822
I know. I'm sorry.

10:54.846 --> 10:57.341
Oh, and I spy with my little eye

10:57.353 --> 10:59.837
something with four legs that can't run.

10:59.970 --> 11:02.201
Homer, we're not really playing.

11:03.015 --> 11:04.036
Is it the chair?

11:04.103 --> 11:06.967
Exactly! Now, what has two ears but can't hear?

11:07.235 --> 11:08.019
Grandpa!

11:08.087 --> 11:09.243
Tragically, yes.

11:09.779 --> 11:12.773
What if we show Lisa we can sleep in her room

11:12.798 --> 11:14.539
without being frightened?

11:14.844 --> 11:16.098
Okay, Marge.

11:16.696 --> 11:20.930
But don't be surprised if a 
snuggle monster shows up.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.355
Well, I hope he's accompanied 
by the "how was your day"

11:24.375 --> 11:27.930
monster and the "foot rub" monster, 
and the "let me just...."

11:27.955 --> 11:29.799
don't worry, he's not showing up.

11:39.095 --> 11:42.043
Boy, Lisa's room really is scary.

11:43.914 --> 11:48.684
Now, Willie, the pot of gold 
I saw is right down there.

11:49.184 --> 11:53.832
All I see is an empty grave. Why 
don't you fill it, you lazy bastard!

11:53.868 --> 11:57.370
Finally! Back in the only safe 
bedroom in the house.

11:57.464 --> 11:58.989
What about Bart's bedroom?

11:59.025 --> 12:00.624
You know that race car bed I made him?

12:01.257 --> 12:02.692
The brakes are shot.

12:09.206 --> 12:13.338
Lisa, honey, any chance you 
could stop reading soon?

12:13.636 --> 12:15.529
Okay, I'll watch TV.

12:17.303 --> 12:21.434
Now, rerunland takes you back 
to 1965 with Bonanza.

12:21.803 --> 12:25.253
See here, cartwright, your boys 
have been eating my apples.

12:25.474 --> 12:27.483
That doesn't sound like my boys.

12:27.495 --> 12:29.535
I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue.

12:36.363 --> 12:39.416
Lisa, do you really want to watch this?

12:39.562 --> 12:41.972
Mom, I think there's a danger this time

12:41.996 --> 12:43.721
they might lose the ponderosa.

12:45.408 --> 12:46.976
Learn to drive, boy!

12:47.925 --> 12:51.183
We need professional help.

12:57.650 --> 13:01.293
As a young child, did Lisa 
receive a lot of nurturing?

13:01.325 --> 13:02.661
Frankly,  no.

13:03.029 --> 13:05.052
Lisa kind of took care of herself.

13:05.074 --> 13:07.492
Our oldest, Bart, was such a handful.

13:07.529 --> 13:10.302
Did you bring those home movies 
of your daughter I asked for?

13:10.344 --> 13:12.613
This is all I could find.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.547
Why you very little...!

13:22.490 --> 13:23.977
Homer, stop that!

13:29.527 --> 13:31.173
Who was filming that scene?

13:31.183 --> 13:32.056
Stationary camera.

13:33.574 --> 13:34.545
I see.

13:34.785 --> 13:38.050
Mr. And mrs. Simpson, to 
overcome her neglect,

13:38.122 --> 13:40.656
Lisa had to suppress her childhood fears.

13:40.829 --> 13:43.928
My ten-week program can help 
her learn to be a kid again.

13:44.134 --> 13:46.224
Well worth the $4,000.

13:46.422 --> 13:48.219
$4,000?

13:48.412 --> 13:51.700
Now, Marge, when our little 
girl's happiness is at stake...

13:51.732 --> 13:54.217
Run, Marge! Start the car!

13:57.751 --> 14:00.082
I'm not chasing you, Mr. Simpson.

14:00.113 --> 14:01.281
And you won't!

14:01.409 --> 14:04.111
Unless you can leap through fire!

14:07.848 --> 14:10.725
I can't keep sleeping in 
mom and dad's room.

14:10.805 --> 14:12.635
Yeah, if dad rolls over, you're dead.

14:12.672 --> 14:15.261
Mom showed me how to make a 
retaining wall out of pillows.

14:15.399 --> 14:18.030
But I'm going to conquer my fears... tonight.

14:31.734 --> 14:32.903
I changed my mind!

14:32.942 --> 14:34.718
Can you please open the gate?

14:35.465 --> 14:36.756
I don't work here.

14:36.755 --> 14:39.042
I was just visiting another 
security guard that died.

14:39.738 --> 14:40.626
Bye, now.

14:48.803 --> 14:50.679
If I can just spend the night here,

14:50.728 --> 14:52.353
I'll never be scared again.

14:52.905 --> 14:56.519
And, boy, you're free to 
go home whenever you want.

15:06.827 --> 15:07.958
Hi, Dr. Nick.

15:07.995 --> 15:09.294
Hi, everybody!

15:09.442 --> 15:11.686
I mean, I'm not dr. Nick.

15:11.973 --> 15:14.692
I'M... Dr. Octopus.

15:16.388 --> 15:18.546
I'm going to get you, spidey.

15:18.586 --> 15:21.870
Then I will have upside-down 
kiss with Mary Jane.

15:23.741 --> 15:24.802
Bye, Dr. Nick.

15:24.852 --> 15:25.822
Bye, Lisa.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.824
And remember, you have a 
checkup next thursday.

15:28.967 --> 15:30.592
We don't go to you anymore.

15:30.623 --> 15:32.037
We have a better doctor.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.774
Oh, congratulations!

15:40.852 --> 15:42.788
Boys, that grave robber 
could be anywhere.

15:42.831 --> 15:45.313
The most vital thing is 
that we stick together.

15:45.796 --> 15:47.096
Wait. Where did everybody go?

15:47.181 --> 15:48.688
Okay, this is it, Clancy.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.228
No squad car, no backup, 
legs cramping in fear,

15:52.277 --> 15:54.099
sweat in my eyes and groin...

15:54.582 --> 15:57.047
I'd better get out of 
this damn cop uniform

15:57.071 --> 15:58.979
before someone takes a shot at me.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.051
There we go.

16:02.201 --> 16:03.793
There's my walkman.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.721
You know, I actually got into law school,

16:12.763 --> 16:14.101
but I just couldn't afford it.

16:14.216 --> 16:15.771
Quiet, I hear something.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.307
Yeah, that's my life slipping away.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.048
okay, got to keep calm.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.009
If Scooby Doo has taught me anything,

16:22.064 --> 16:24.877
it's that the only thing to fear 
are crooked real estate developers.

16:54.616 --> 16:55.764
where's Lisa, boy?

16:55.918 --> 16:57.792
This book's going to solve all her problems.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.026
Well, if you're looking for Lisa,

16:59.068 --> 17:01.330
she said she was going to spend 
the night in the bone yard out back.

17:01.429 --> 17:02.315
The cemetery?

17:02.431 --> 17:03.902
And you're just sitting here?

17:04.003 --> 17:07.865
I figured the best thing I could 
do is monitor the news for any reports.

17:07.976 --> 17:09.329
You're watching cartoons!

17:14.553 --> 17:16.334
Just the show for me!

17:24.348 --> 17:26.871
Tim-Tom Tabby is a curious cat.

17:27.199 --> 17:30.222
Went to see the queen in a velveteen hat.

17:31.935 --> 17:33.951
This is so boring!

17:40.401 --> 17:42.161
Hey, mom, can we have fried 
chicken for dinner?

17:43.192 --> 17:44.486
Lisa!

17:44.819 --> 17:45.815
Lisa!

17:45.840 --> 17:46.737
Lisa!

17:47.038 --> 17:48.272
Don't worry,

17:48.497 --> 17:50.364
we're not evil spirits!

17:50.438 --> 17:54.686
Although, we were evil spirits, we'd probably 
assume the shape of your parents.

17:54.784 --> 17:55.460
Homer!

17:55.829 --> 17:57.479
Marge, we owe her the truth.

18:08.493 --> 18:09.896
There, there, dear.

18:10.429 --> 18:12.407
Grandma will protect you.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.243
But I ain't grandma!

18:23.660 --> 18:26.142
Lisa, meet your new husband.

18:28.176 --> 18:30.640
I made us a dream house out of slime!

18:31.984 --> 18:36.127
I don't know how I reproduce, but we'll 
have a great time figuring it out.

18:42.376 --> 18:43.390
where am I?

18:49.425 --> 18:52.824
welcome to the land of wild beasts, little girl.

18:58.549 --> 19:00.480
Not scared. Not scared.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.568
For god's sake, girl, you're eight years old.

19:04.618 --> 19:06.801
It's natural for you to feel scared sometime.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.206
But I'm too smart to get scared.

19:09.385 --> 19:11.357
Lisa, everybody gets scared,

19:11.509 --> 19:13.845
no matter how old or how smart they are.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.253
In fact, I'm scared of her.

19:16.302 --> 19:18.982
No, you're afraid of intimacy.

19:19.171 --> 19:21.888
That's because I know after 
we mate, you'll eat me.

19:22.134 --> 19:24.025
Your brother didn't seem to mind.

19:24.357 --> 19:26.877
You  know, you monsters seem scary,

19:26.914 --> 19:29.005
but when you get a little closer...

19:29.741 --> 19:31.339
You're just funny.

19:36.813 --> 19:37.760
But wait.

19:37.841 --> 19:41.488
How am I supposed to sleep with that 
spooky cemetery outside my window?

19:41.715 --> 19:44.678
You could just draw the blinds, you silly goose.

19:44.703 --> 19:45.993
Or get a night-light.

19:46.175 --> 19:47.957
My dad says they're too expensive.

19:49.531 --> 19:51.412
For god's sake, they're four bucks apiece.

19:51.547 --> 19:56.049
I could slime your dad, just like 
I slimed us a paris honeymoon.

19:59.172 --> 20:01.330
I think I'll be okay by myself.

20:01.669 --> 20:05.124
What is it about slime that chicks don't dig?

20:07.766 --> 20:08.909
Bye, guys.

20:08.970 --> 20:10.387
You've really helped me a lot.

20:10.547 --> 20:11.549
Bye-bye, Lisa.

20:11.598 --> 20:12.446
Bye, Lisa!

20:12.446 --> 20:13.381
See you soon!

20:15.273 --> 20:17.966
We're always just a concussion away!

20:19.607 --> 20:21.761
Lisa, honey, please wake up.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.515
If you do, I'll get you a new pony.

20:23.762 --> 20:24.340
New pony?

20:24.687 --> 20:26.799
This is still part of your dream.

20:27.047 --> 20:29.767
Dreaming... dreaming...

20:30.232 --> 20:31.191
Now you're awake.

20:32.601 --> 20:34.938
Sweetie, we're going to get you home

20:34.966 --> 20:37.753
and straighten out all these fears you have.

20:38.057 --> 20:39.901
I think I'm going to be fine.

20:39.926 --> 20:41.370
Let's get some breakfast.

20:46.362 --> 20:47.792
Uh, chief, it's light out.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.376
You can open your eyes and come down.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.397
I don't want to, Lou!

20:50.538 --> 20:52.637
I've got a pizza bagel for you.

20:52.786 --> 20:53.473
Let's roll.

20:54.305 --> 21:00.882
