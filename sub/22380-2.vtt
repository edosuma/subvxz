-Hey.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.896
Were we that loud last night?

00:20.938 --> 00:22.565
Mm, kind of.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.733
Sorry.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.609
Wheeler's a bit of a screamer.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.653
(both laugh)

00:29.822 --> 00:31.115
How's your love life these days?

00:31.157 --> 00:32.992
Nonexistent.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.827
What about that girl
at the laundromat?

00:34.869 --> 00:37.580
Oh, things got weird.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.165
Like "clingy" weird?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.042
No, like "choke me" weird.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.253
Oh.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.505
Well, keep your chin up.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.466
Everybody goes through
dry spells.

00:48.507 --> 00:49.717
What's your longest?

00:51.927 --> 00:53.179
Like, a week?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.264
But I'm a chick,
so it's not the same.

00:55.306 --> 00:58.058
Yeah, your dry spells
are voluntary.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.521
Oh, shit.
Is that the time?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.857
I'm gonna be late. Here.

MISTY:
Hi.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.488
-DAVID: Morning.
-(groans)

01:10.529 --> 01:13.157
Thanks for letting Misty and I
use the bedroom last night.

01:13.199 --> 01:15.117
Yeah, no problem,
just, uh, wash the sheets.

01:15.159 --> 01:18.078
What, you don't like 'em crusty?

01:18.120 --> 01:20.206
Huh? Hey, you need anything
from the store?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.957
I figure while I'm out in
the 'burbs dropping off Misty,

01:21.999 --> 01:23.209
I can hit up the A&P.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.002
I thought you had
your Columbia class.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.838
-Not till 1:00.
-Ah. Want ramen?

01:27.880 --> 01:30.800
(droning meditatively)

01:34.053 --> 01:35.221
Okay, got it.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.348
-Got what?
-It's my memory palace.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.809
It's a mnemonic device
invented by the ancient Greeks.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.144
Basically, you take something
you want to remember,

01:42.186 --> 01:44.688
and place it like furniture
in the rooms

01:44.730 --> 01:46.816
of a mental house based on
somewhere you know really well.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.651
Like, I use my nana's.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.110
So, for instance,
I imagined Ultraman

01:50.152 --> 01:52.363
slurping a big bowl of ramen

01:52.404 --> 01:54.532
-in her rec room.
-Why Ultraman?

01:54.573 --> 01:57.201
Because he's Japanese
and fucking awesome.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.786
Mm. Isn't it hard
to see Ultraman

01:58.828 --> 01:59.829
through the clouds of pot smoke?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.789
Dude, gave it up.

02:01.831 --> 02:03.415
Haven't smoked since,
like, March.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.167
-You serious?
-Yeah, man.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.418
Figure if I'm gonna be
an educator,

02:06.460 --> 02:07.837
I need to set a good example.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.880
-Wow.
-Not even dealing anymore.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.800
Oh, which reminds me...

02:12.842 --> 02:14.635
(inhales)
Ah.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.554
Sorry I can't help out more
with the rent.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.139

this involuntary vacation

We're actually thinking of
forming a grievance committee,

03:09.273 --> 03:11.734
and we are gonna send
a harshly worded letter

03:11.775 --> 03:13.110
complaining to the warden.

Well, actually, sir,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.161
I've come with
some upsetting news.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.412
Uh-oh.

03:23.454 --> 03:26.832
The Japanese wish
to buy Red Oaks.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.294
Says who?

03:30.336 --> 03:32.046
Rebecca Horowitz.

03:32.087 --> 03:35.132
Tough shit.
It's not for sale.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.717
Right. Well,
according to Rebecca,

03:36.759 --> 03:38.677
membership is down,
and the club is struggling.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.180
That's what makes
the Japanese offer so tempting.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.974
I don't care.
Let 'em buy Windybush.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.142
(chuckles)
They're not in the market

03:45.184 --> 03:46.810
for a leper colony, sir.

03:46.852 --> 03:49.563
What do they want with
a country club for anyway?

03:49.605 --> 03:50.731
Skip says they're mad
about golf.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.149
You know what?
These people,

03:52.191 --> 03:53.567
they want to spend their yen

03:53.609 --> 03:56.195
buying up half of Manhattan,
that's their business.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.655
But they're not getting
Red Oaks.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.530
I'm sorry, no.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.199
As-as Americans,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.575
we have to draw a line.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.077
You got to draw a line
somewhere.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.120
Otherwise, I'm telling you,
we're gonna wake up one day,

04:05.162 --> 04:08.290

-What's this?

04:26.225 --> 04:28.352
It's a new breakfast sandwich
I've been working on.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.772
It's got fried egg,
Italian sausage,

You missed your calling, buddy.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.741
You know, I've often wondered
where I'd be if the Army had

04:42.783 --> 04:45.661
assigned me to food services
instead of supply corps.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.204
Could be you who's Burger King.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.456

working at the IRS,

-Yeah.

05:24.575 --> 05:27.786
-No. -Give me
one good reason why not.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.372
Because I'm a heart patient.
I need the health insurance.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.041
Look, I'm not gonna give up
government benefits

05:32.082 --> 05:33.250

06:09.036 --> 06:10.746
is just minding his business
one day,

06:10.788 --> 06:13.373
being this bisexual French dude,

06:13.415 --> 06:15.042
having a little snack,

06:15.084 --> 06:17.294
when all of a sudden
he takes a bite of his cookie--

06:17.336 --> 06:18.712
or madeleine--

06:18.754 --> 06:21.131
like, some French pastry.
I don't know,

06:21.173 --> 06:22.466
I never had one. Anyways,

06:22.508 --> 06:24.468
he dunks it in some tea,
and bam!

like an acid flashback.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.140
Totally mind-expanding.

06:30.182 --> 06:32.851
He starts remembering everything
from his childhood.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.479
And, like, the detail
in which he's recalling this,

06:35.521 --> 06:38.315
or telling the story,
is remarkable.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.401

Yes, I'm sorry about that.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.790

out at $30,000 a year.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.057
Who's Dr. Ron?

09:17.099 --> 09:18.892
The dentist I'm observing.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.519
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.062
You definitely mentioned that.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.398
You think he might
offer you a job?

09:24.439 --> 09:25.691
Maybe. He's super nice.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.401
I like this one.

09:27.442 --> 09:31.571
Three bed, two and a half bath
townhouse with garage.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.950
Wonder what the monthly payment
on a $73,000 place would be.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.743
Well, a 30-year fixed mortgage

09:36.785 --> 09:39.037
at a current interest rate
of ten and a half percent

09:39.079 --> 09:40.664
comes to about $668 a month,

09:40.706 --> 09:43.166
not counting taxes
and insurance.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.460
Did you just do that
in your head?

09:45.502 --> 09:48.088

works since giving up weed.

are thinking sometimes.

09:49.715 --> 09:51.675

09:51.717 --> 09:53.844
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.595

09:55.637 --> 09:59.224
WHEELER: She's thinking how much
bullshit it is that David's mom

09:59.266 --> 10:02.811
is getting a party when she's
only been a realtor for a year.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.896

And what about her?
What's she thinking?

10:08.859 --> 10:11.028

is that guy's problem?

someone as beautiful as yourself

10:21.413 --> 10:23.040

10:25.250 --> 10:26.501
-Hey.
-Yeah?

10:28.879 --> 10:31.965
So, my son David works
in the entertainment business.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.258
How exciting!

10:33.300 --> 10:34.676
Have you met anyone famous?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.511
Uh, one time I drove Cher
to the airport.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.388
Ooh! I love her.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.390
Is that your father?

10:40.432 --> 10:42.142
What is he doing?
Did you know he was coming?

How do you do?
I'm Sam Meyers.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.653
-Hi.
-I used to be married to her.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.322
-Aw. -I'm gonna catch up
with Wheeler and Misty.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.615
-Okay, sweetie.
-Listen, honey,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.075
I don't know
what you get somebody

10:58.116 --> 10:59.576
who sells a million bucks
worth of real estate,

10:59.618 --> 11:01.453
so I went with this.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.829
You are so sweet.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.498
That is so thoughtful.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.041
-Thanks.
-Thank you so much.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.210
I'm gonna go put it down.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.503

Good.

Hey.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.842
There you are.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.470
Mom take you for a spin

11:18.512 --> 11:20.305
-in her new car?
-No.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.683
So... how's work?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.894
-Yeah, it's good.
-Good.

11:25.936 --> 11:28.522
Good.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.482
Tell me what a
production assistant does again.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.901
-It's pretty much
whatever needs doing. -Like?

11:32.943 --> 11:35.862
Like stopping traffic
on location,

11:35.904 --> 11:37.531
getting my bosses' cars washed,

11:37.572 --> 11:39.282
getting lunch.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.202
And all of this will lead to you
eventually becoming a director?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.537
In theory.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.664
Well, good. Good for you
for paying your dues.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.333
This is what you should be
doing at your age.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.043
Too many kids nowaday,
they think the world owes them

11:50.085 --> 11:51.294
a golden ticket, you know?

11:51.336 --> 11:52.546
And then they don't get it,

11:52.587 --> 11:54.172
so they just throw in the towel,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.424
start peddling dope

11:55.465 --> 11:58.135
or stealing stereos, or...

11:58.176 --> 11:59.970
hustling some guy
in some porn theater

12:00.011 --> 12:02.097

what's that terrible movie?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.807
-Midnight Cowboy.
-Midnight Cowboy.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.100

-Uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-Oh, come on, come on.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.358

to the corruption of a senior.

Oh, I miss them so much. Oh.

Sam!

12:24.870 --> 12:26.496
What do you think you're doing?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.540
No, we were just
admiring your car.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.792
Oh. It's cute, isn't it?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.669
I mean, it's not very practical,
but, you know,

12:32.711 --> 12:34.421
I just thought,
"Judy, you deserve it.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.131
When was the last time you did
something for yourself?"

12:36.173 --> 12:38.216

Wheeler. Congrats again, Mom.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.474
Oh, of course.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.476
There's a little storefront
over on Upland Avenue

12:47.517 --> 12:50.145

your own practice again?

12:52.314 --> 12:54.316
Well, not exactly. Just...

a commercial before,

13:53.375 --> 13:55.126

they're desperate.

And they have, like,
zero budget, which is fine.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.756

13:59.798 --> 14:01.424

14:01.466 --> 14:03.802
So you're just gonna march
into Nigel's office

14:03.843 --> 14:05.053

14:05.095 --> 14:07.556
No. He doesn't even
know my name.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.100

Derek to watch my reel,

14:10.141 --> 14:11.393
maybe I've got a shot.

14:12.644 --> 14:13.937
Okay.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.397

go anywhere near him before he's
had his second cup of coffee.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
And late morning is iffy, too,

14:24.406 --> 14:26.283

gets low.

-DAVID: So, like after lunch?
-But not right after,

14:29.119 --> 14:30.620
because he gets sleepy.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.624
But don't wait too many hours

Mm-hmm.

17:43.354 --> 17:46.608
Ah, my Gracie can handle that.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.610
Mm-hmm.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.163
-Yes?
-Uh, Dr. Fox?

18:00.205 --> 18:02.207
Ah, Mr. Wheeler. Sit down.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.751
You're just in time for tea.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.212
I'm afraid I'm fresh out
of madeleines.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.797
(both chuckle)

18:08.838 --> 18:10.131
So, have you given
any more thought

18:10.173 --> 18:12.300
to doing your term paper
on Proust?

18:12.342 --> 18:14.469
I did, but I think I'm actually
more into Faulkner.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.679
I'm really digging
The Sound and the Fury.

18:16.721 --> 18:20.517
Oh. And what about it
speaks to you?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.101
You know, I just think it's cool

18:22.143 --> 18:24.103
how he tells a story
from different perspectives.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.939
Like, Benjy
the retarded brother,

18:25.980 --> 18:29.400
and Quentin, who I'm pretty sure
is gonna kill himself.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.277
Does depression
run in your family?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.279
Hmm.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.697
Um, not really.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.157
I mean, my nana
was pretty bummed

18:36.199 --> 18:37.617
when they canceled
Search for Tomorrow,

18:37.659 --> 18:39.494
but I think
she's over it by now.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.329
Uh, what about schizophrenia?

18:41.371 --> 18:44.123
-She's just old.
-(laughs)

18:44.165 --> 18:45.500
Um, how delightful.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.460
I do enjoy your sense of humor.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.088
T-Thanks.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.090
I don't know
if you're interested,

18:52.131 --> 18:55.093
but my husband Cecil and I host
a little salon at our home,

18:55.134 --> 18:58.304
twice a month for some
of our more promising students.

18:58.346 --> 19:00.306
Cecil teaches
in the Classics department.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.809
The next one is on Tuesday,
if you're free.

19:02.851 --> 19:07.272
I'd love to show you some
of our Faulkner first editions.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.941
(chuckles)
Okay.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.360
Yeah, I mean, sounds great.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.695
Wonderful.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.031
Later.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.908
See you then.

(alarm beeping)

20:11.544 --> 20:12.587
Hey, Derek.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.713
Am I disturbing you?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.548
-On many levels.
-Oh, uh, sorry.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.508
I-I can come back.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.218
What do you want?

20:19.260 --> 20:20.637
I was wondering if, maybe,

20:20.678 --> 20:23.681
-you might check out
my reel sometime. -Why?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.808
You've produced a ton of
music videos and commercials,

20:25.850 --> 20:27.435
and I figured you'd be
a good person to ask

20:27.477 --> 20:29.062
for, like, career advice.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.647
And a feature.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.190
Excuse me?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.192
I also produced a feature.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.152
It got mostly positive reviews.

20:36.194 --> 20:38.154
(stammering):
Yeah. It was great.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.740
That's why I value your opinion.

20:42.617 --> 20:43.785
(sighs)

20:43.826 --> 20:45.328
Leave it on my desk.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.747
-Thank you.
-Yes.

WHEELER:
I don't know, man, I just...

20:52.251 --> 20:53.920
I have a weird feeling
about this lady.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.672
Mm. Did you get
a sexual vibe from her?

20:55.713 --> 20:59.092
Not really, I mean, she asked me
a lot of personal questions.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.301
Any physical contact?

21:00.343 --> 21:02.053
-No!
-Hmm.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.304
Eh, she's probably
just being friendly.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.847
So you think it's safe

21:04.889 --> 21:06.557
to go to this thing at her
apartment next Tuesday?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.851
It's not, like, a front
for Upper West Side vampires?

21:08.893 --> 21:10.853
No. But that's a pretty cool
idea for a movie.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.897
Mm. Kind of is, yeah.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.108
Hey, did you see
the preview for Lost Boys?

21:15.149 --> 21:17.402
You will love it.
It's so fucking good.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.237
-Oh, really?
-(doorbell buzzes)

21:19.278 --> 21:21.781
-Hello?
-NASH: It's Nash, let me in.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.451
Dude!

21:27.620 --> 21:28.913
-Boychiks!
-WHEELER: Dude!

21:28.955 --> 21:30.581
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes,

21:30.623 --> 21:31.541
Bring it in.

21:31.582 --> 21:33.543
(laughing):
Oh!

21:33.584 --> 21:37.213
Mwah. Mwah.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.215
You taste of ramen,
and disappointment.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.761
-WHEELER: Come on in.
-Thank you.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.723
It's quite the friendly
neighborhood you've got here.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.808
In the five minutes it took
for me to walk from my car,

21:48.850 --> 21:52.437
I was offered fellatio and the
opportunity to purchase a horse.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.604
Oh, that means heroin.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.106
Yeah, it gets a little sketchy
after dark.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.691
-(siren wailing in distance)
-Hmm.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.234
-(microwave beeps)
-Want to stay for dinner?

21:58.276 --> 21:59.569
-NASH: Absolutely.
-You like Mexican?

21:59.610 --> 22:01.112
-NASH: I think so.
-Great.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.662
This place is rather cozy.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.373
-Dude, how you been?
-Good, good.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.375
Lost a bit of weight,
mostly in the wrist.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.086
You'll notice how loose
my watch strap is.

22:17.128 --> 22:19.213
-I miss you, man.
-Yeah, I'm sorry we never

22:19.255 --> 22:20.631
made it to Boca
to see you this winter.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.592
Oh, that's fine,
I actually ended up

22:22.633 --> 22:24.010
cutting my trip rather short.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.178
Why?

22:25.219 --> 22:27.013
It's a long story.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.223
All I'll say
is that I had no idea

22:29.265 --> 22:31.350
the young lady
was the daughter of the mayor.

22:31.392 --> 22:34.228
Nor that she was under
the legal drinking age.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.647
-(inhales sharply) -Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit is right.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.566
Now, until His Honor
completes his term in office,

22:38.608 --> 22:42.236
I'm afraid I'm persona non grata
in the city of Boca Raton.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.490
It's a pity, too,
I really enjoy it there.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.409
-Misty was telling me that you
hired a new assistant pro? -Mm.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.036
Rusty.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.038
DAVID:
What's he like?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.331
He's gigantic.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.707
That's not an exaggeration.

22:54.749 --> 22:56.959
He's a half a human
taller than you.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.087
And hung like a white rhino.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.923
I accidentally happened upon him
changing in the locker room.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.925
Put me off food for a week.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.051
Which explains the weight loss.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.469
Huh?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.554
So, dude, what are you doing
in the city?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.056
Ah, yes.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.808
Uh, well.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.019
Boychiks, I wish I could say
this is strictly a social call.

23:15.061 --> 23:18.648
But I've come with grave news
and an urgent summons.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.149
Summons?

23:20.191 --> 23:22.193
From who?

23:26.155 --> 23:27.990
NASH:
All right, now, whatever you do,

23:28.032 --> 23:29.534
avoid eye contact at all costs.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.285
-Why?
-It's a sign of aggression.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.954
It could get you shanked
in the kidneys.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.288
And stay calm.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.915
Convicts can smell fear.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.291
They're like dogs or bees.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.584

Oh.

You got one here.
