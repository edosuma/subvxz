WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.959
That police helicopter's
been flying pretty low.

00:05.041 --> 00:06.667
That's because they know what I did.

00:06.750 --> 00:07.834
What'd you do?

00:07.917 --> 00:10.291
I took some extra packets
of hot sauce from Taco Town.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.291
I mean, two, sure. Three, maybe, but four?

00:13.417 --> 00:14.875
What kind of sicko am I?

00:17.125 --> 00:18.250
It's not you, Jerry.

00:18.291 --> 00:20.959
A prisoner busted out
of the Seaford Correctional Facility.

00:21.041 --> 00:22.500
They've been looking for him all morning.

00:24.083 --> 00:25.250
That's a relief.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.875
I'm gonna get some more hot sauce.

00:27.583 --> 00:28.709
Ooh.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.792
Guys, guys, guys.

00:46.875 --> 00:49.500
You see that dude over there?
He's wearing orange pants.

00:49.583 --> 00:50.625
You know what that means?

00:51.875 --> 00:54.000
It means he's secure
in who he is as a man.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.959
I mean, orange after Labor Day?
That's just bold.

00:59.083 --> 01:02.208
No. He means that's the escaped convict
they're looking for.

01:03.750 --> 01:07.166
Oh. I'm going to subtly let that
helicopter know he's over there.

01:10.458 --> 01:11.959
Hey, helicopter man!

01:12.041 --> 01:13.500
He's over there!

01:13.583 --> 01:15.583
Don't you dare move, mister.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.125
Don't you move!

01:19.750 --> 01:21.375
- Aah!
-

01:37.709 --> 01:41.917
Okay. The show's over.
Remain calm, people. We got him.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.709
You're lucky you didn't have
to deal with me.

01:46.792 --> 01:50.125
Because then you would have met
Laverne and Shirley!

01:51.041 --> 01:52.959
- Ah!
- Mommy!

02:38.375 --> 02:40.208
Guys, we've been on the news all day.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.959
They used surveillance footage
from the mall security camera.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.834
I kicked butt, and looked good
while doing it.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.375
Uh, you know, Kim,
in the interview with the reporter,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.667
you kind of made it sound like
you took the guy down by yourself.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.166
What makes you say that?

02:54.250 --> 02:57.542
Because you said, and I quote,
"I took the guy down by myself."

02:59.375 --> 03:01.625
Hey, hey. You guys aren't
the only ones on the news.

03:02.083 --> 03:05.291
Yeah, on Spanish TV,
they mentioned me, Eddie, and Milton.

03:05.375 --> 03:09.583
They called us
" <i>Los tres gusanos sin espinas".</i>

03:10.208 --> 03:11.208
Wow. What does that mean?

03:11.625 --> 03:13.000
Three spineless worms.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.250
There they are. Guys, look who's here.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.208
I don't believe it. It's Dolph Gruber!

03:22.291 --> 03:25.000
I've seen all your movies.
You're the best action star ever.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.667
Aw, you're too kind.

03:27.125 --> 03:29.166
I saw you on the news last night.

03:29.291 --> 03:31.125
What you do is incredible.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.250
Hello, spineless worms.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.750
Uh, what brings you to our dojo?

03:38.291 --> 03:41.291
I want you two in my movie
is what I'm wanting.

03:41.834 --> 03:45.542
I'm directing what will be
the greatest martial arts movie ever.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.166
An epic battle for survival.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.834
It's called <i>The Karate Games.</i>

03:51.917 --> 03:53.291
Do you lub it?

03:53.917 --> 03:55.625
Yes, I lub it.

03:56.166 --> 03:58.166
But, uh, Dolph, we're not actors.

03:58.250 --> 04:02.250
That's why you're perfect.
Actors are fake. You are real.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.834
You're fresh, you're gutsy,
you have great hair.

04:04.917 --> 04:05.875
Thank you.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.166
I was talking to the boy.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.458
Ha!

04:09.166 --> 04:11.959
What do you say, Yak and Kam?

04:12.041 --> 04:13.542
I could be a star!

04:13.625 --> 04:16.750
Watch out Hollywood.
Here comes Yak and Kam.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.250
We shoot the first scene right here.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.250
This is your underground bunker.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.917
Oh, cool.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.041
It's good.

04:36.959 --> 04:38.667
Your characters are enemies.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.917
But you're brought together by
the most powerful thing in the universe.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.417
A kiss.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.041
Oh.

04:47.959 --> 04:49.041
Oh.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.458
Being seen on the news hiding behind
an old woman is so embarrassing.

04:56.542 --> 04:57.583
Tell me about it.

04:57.667 --> 05:01.792
On my way to school, all I heard
was "scaredy pants, scaredy pants".

05:01.875 --> 05:05.458
I finally said to my father,
"Stop the car! I'd rather walk."

05:08.000 --> 05:10.083
Yo, what's this?

05:10.166 --> 05:12.000
It's a gift from Mayor Batty.

05:12.375 --> 05:15.875
"The city of Seaford thanks you
for your act of bravery and valor."

05:21.875 --> 05:24.250
Oh, dude! That thing is awesome!

05:24.375 --> 05:26.834
I've always wanted one. What is it?

05:28.792 --> 05:32.083
It's a Punchmaster Elite.
The newest karate trainer.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.542
They don't even sell these in stores yet.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.792
Dude. With this thing we're gonna
become fearless fighting machines.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.291
<i>Man up and punch me!</i>

05:43.750 --> 05:46.500
Uh... I don't like that man.
Can you change him?

05:47.291 --> 05:48.750
That was a biker.

05:48.834 --> 05:52.041
Uh, there's Prison Guard
and Drill Sergeant.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.250
Ooh, this might be a good one for us.

05:54.291 --> 05:55.917
- English nanny.
-

05:56.000 --> 05:57.250
<i>Be a love.</i>

05:57.333 --> 05:59.000
<i>Give mumsie a punch?</i>

05:59.709 --> 06:01.250
All right.

06:02.041 --> 06:03.208
I got this.

06:05.959 --> 06:08.417
<i>I said hit me!</i>

06:08.500 --> 06:10.250
Turn it back to biker. Back to biker!

06:10.333 --> 06:11.875
- Hmm. Come on!
-

06:16.333 --> 06:17.500
And...

06:18.125 --> 06:19.458
Action.

06:19.917 --> 06:21.208
But I hate you.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.959
<i>You're from Zone Five.</i>

06:23.750 --> 06:25.542
<i>You vaporized my father.</i>

06:25.625 --> 06:27.125
<i>I had to vaporize him.</i>

06:27.208 --> 06:31.125
<i>He was implanted with the evil egg
and smelled of elderberries.</i>

06:33.125 --> 06:34.583
<i>So by killing him,</i>

06:35.000 --> 06:36.375
<i>that means you saved...</i>

06:37.000 --> 06:38.125
<i>me?</i>

06:39.750 --> 06:41.750
<i>No. I saved...</i>

06:42.333 --> 06:43.542
<i>us.</i>

06:47.959 --> 06:49.583
<i>Uh, did someone say "cut"?</i>

06:49.667 --> 06:51.542
<i>Yeah, I heard a "cut".
Someone definitely said "cut".</i>

06:51.875 --> 06:53.959
Perfect.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.250
Bring in the stunt lips for the close-up.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.000
Right! And...

07:00.083 --> 07:02.625
lips and... action!

07:03.125 --> 07:04.291
Yeah, that's right, huh?

07:04.375 --> 07:06.625
Good. Now I need more passion.
I need more passion!

07:06.709 --> 07:08.291
What, are you kissing your grandmother?

07:08.458 --> 07:10.250
Come on, put your back into it.

07:10.291 --> 07:11.667
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

07:11.750 --> 07:13.875
Yeah! Genius!

07:17.458 --> 07:19.166
Why are you wearing those
night vision goggles?

07:19.250 --> 07:21.542
Phil's too cheap to replace
the light in his bathroom,

07:21.625 --> 07:23.458
and I'm tired of losing
that guessing game.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.000
With Jack and Kim out of town,

07:27.083 --> 07:29.834
shouldn't you guys be hiding
behind some old ladies?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.041
Listen, Frank.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.000
You don't want to mess
with us anymore, okay?

07:35.083 --> 07:37.667
Yeah, we've been working out
in a whole new way.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.250
Our dojo is now the proud owner
of a Punchmaster Elite.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.625
You hear that guys?

07:43.709 --> 07:47.166
Looks like we're gonna get ourselves
a Punchmaster Elite.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.208
- You are going to love it!
- Love it.

07:49.291 --> 07:51.458
It's not just a teaching aid,
it's a way of life...

07:51.542 --> 07:53.792
Oh, you're taking ours, aren't you?

07:55.083 --> 07:57.291
Have it ready for pickup at 6:30.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.333
Hey, I was walking around the lot
and I got turned around.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.250
- All right, we're on.
- Huh?

08:08.542 --> 08:10.750
Hi everybody, I'm Wink Palmdale.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.792
It's time to meet our
next contestant on...

08:12.875 --> 08:15.542
<i>Box That Head!</i>

08:16.959 --> 08:18.375
No, no. I'm not a contestant.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.875
Remember, you're playing for $50,000.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.750
Let's box this head!

08:27.291 --> 08:29.709
In this scene,
you climb the ladder out the bunker

08:29.792 --> 08:31.750
and emerge in the Hollywood forest.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.917
That's where the real action begins.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.542
Uh, actually Dolph, if I may.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.083
My character's the best hunter
from Zone Nine,

08:39.166 --> 08:40.834
so I should probably go first.

08:40.917 --> 08:42.625
- Yeah, okay. Do that.
- Uh, actually.

08:42.709 --> 08:44.583
Uh, since my character's
the strongest fighter,

08:44.667 --> 08:46.000
you should probably be following me.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.792
- He makes a good point.
- I follow no man!

08:48.875 --> 08:52.542
- But I'm Malachi, son of the great--
- Oh, you want to talk about greatness?

08:54.208 --> 08:56.500
Will someone please get up
the <i>gunterschlagen</i> ladder?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.959
All right, so what do we do now?
Where is everybody?

09:04.041 --> 09:06.041
Yeah. Hey, Dolph?

09:06.125 --> 09:09.083
What are we supposed to do now?
You never gave us a script for this scene.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.750
<i>Because there isn't one.</i>

09:12.834 --> 09:15.792
<i>Everything from this point forward
is real.</i>

09:15.875 --> 09:18.041
<i>See, you're not acting in this movie.</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:19.291
<i>You are living in it.</i>

09:19.959 --> 09:21.291
What are you saying?

09:21.417 --> 09:22.667
<i>I'm saying...</i>

09:22.750 --> 09:25.333
<i>Welcome to Clown Burger.
May I have your order, please?</i>

09:25.417 --> 09:27.750
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

09:27.834 --> 09:30.208
<i>Whoever's on this channel,
could you please switch?</i>

09:30.291 --> 09:32.375
<i>I'm trying to make a movie here!</i>

09:34.208 --> 09:37.083
<i>What I'm saying, Yak and Kam...</i>

09:37.166 --> 09:41.083
<i>Is I'll be filming your fight
to the very end.</i>

09:41.166 --> 09:43.000
Fighting? Against who?

09:43.083 --> 09:46.333
<i>The fiercest warriors
whoever walked the Earth.</i>

09:46.375 --> 09:49.583
Let the <i>Karate Games</i> begin!

09:49.917 --> 09:50.959
He's kidding, right?

09:53.041 --> 09:54.458
No, I don't think he is.

10:04.208 --> 10:06.291
- Are you ready?
- Do I have a choice?

10:06.375 --> 10:08.291
<i>You must fight to survive.</i>

10:08.375 --> 10:09.542
You don't have a choice.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.291
Kim? Kim?

10:31.834 --> 10:33.083
<i>Jack!</i>

10:34.291 --> 10:35.375
Kim?

10:35.750 --> 10:36.959
<i>Jack!</i>

10:38.959 --> 10:41.500
Okay, the Dragons are gonna
be here in two hours.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.792
- Remember the plan.
- Right. I'll get the suitcases.

10:43.875 --> 10:46.542
I'll get the train tickets.
We can be in Arizona by sunset.

10:47.834 --> 10:48.834
Guys, wait.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.250
We can't do this anymore.

10:52.166 --> 10:55.375
When Frank gets here,
he may rip off our eyebrows...

10:56.583 --> 10:57.750
Yeah, and?

10:58.583 --> 11:00.834
Oh, no. I'm just saying that's
probably what he's gonna do.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.834
Jerry's right.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.834
It's time to stand up for ourselves.

11:05.917 --> 11:07.917
I can't go home without eyebrows.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.375
I'm sorry, guys, but I'm out.

11:12.458 --> 11:13.542
Dude...

11:15.875 --> 11:18.083
Will I still be handsome without eyebrows?

11:19.625 --> 11:21.166
What do you need to hear, buddy?

11:24.792 --> 11:25.917
Okay, Rudy.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.625
One of these boxes will be placed
on your head for ten seconds.

11:29.709 --> 11:32.125
Two of these boxes contain
pleasant things,

11:32.208 --> 11:35.208
and one, not so pleasant.

11:35.291 --> 11:40.166
Survive four rounds of boxes,
and you're one question away from $50,000.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.709
Which box is it gonna be?

11:44.500 --> 11:49.125
Box two, because I really want "to" win.

11:50.792 --> 11:51.834
Box one...

11:54.417 --> 11:55.875
Nothing but rose petals.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.375
Box three, it's just
a couple of cotton balls.

12:01.458 --> 12:02.625
That would have been nice.

12:02.709 --> 12:04.291
<i>Box two...</i>

12:05.125 --> 12:08.875
Oh! Fifteen angry snapping turtles.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.208
Wait, what?

12:10.917 --> 12:13.250
This is going "to" hurt.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.125
Give it to me, people.

12:16.667 --> 12:18.875
Box That Head!

12:24.166 --> 12:25.875
It's got my nose!

12:26.500 --> 12:27.792
It's got my nose!

12:30.583 --> 12:31.917
<i>Jack!</i>

12:32.458 --> 12:33.875
Kim, are you okay?

12:33.959 --> 12:35.375
Yeah, but Jack, be careful.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.291
I was hung here
by Brazilian tree fighters.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.083
What's a Brazilian tree fighter?

12:43.750 --> 12:45.750
That's a Brazilian tree fighter.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.625
Whoa!

12:56.291 --> 12:59.083
I am really starting to hate this movie.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.709
Jack, this is real.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.750
I mean, we got lucky this time,
but what if next time--

13:16.834 --> 13:18.500
Hey, hey. We're gonna be fine, okay?

13:19.166 --> 13:20.667
Kim, I won't let anything happen to you.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.583
<i>Oh, that's touching.</i>

13:23.667 --> 13:27.583
<i>You kids are going to be big stars,
if you survive.</i>

13:27.667 --> 13:29.375
<i>And the only way you'll do that is</i>

13:29.458 --> 13:33.000
<i>if you make it to the Hollywood sign
for my spectacular ending.</i>

13:33.083 --> 13:35.083
<i>You're going to jail, you freak!</i>

13:36.917 --> 13:38.917
<i>I wouldn't worry about me.</i>

13:39.000 --> 13:41.375
<i>I'd just start running to that sign.</i>

13:41.458 --> 13:45.750
<i>And if you're looking for motivation,
here it comes.</i>

13:45.834 --> 13:48.250
-
<i>Get 'em, boys!</i>

13:55.500 --> 13:58.041
<i>There they are! After 'em!</i>

13:59.375 --> 14:02.083
The Black Dragons want to come
for the Punchmaster Elite?

14:02.166 --> 14:03.875
Let 'em come!

14:03.959 --> 14:06.291
- Jerry, switch on that zapper.
- Got you.

14:10.125 --> 14:11.542
Oh, hey. Come on in, Frank.

14:17.750 --> 14:18.959
You're gonna pay for that.

14:20.417 --> 14:23.709
Okay. There's only two other ways
into the dojo.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.250
The vent, or the window in Rudy's office.

14:29.166 --> 14:31.417
Time for operation air vent.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.250
Aah!

14:50.875 --> 14:52.667
- Oh!
-

14:52.750 --> 14:53.834
<i>Hey, Frank!</i>

15:08.375 --> 15:09.500
Aah!

15:11.667 --> 15:12.959
- Whoo!
- Yes!

15:13.417 --> 15:15.709
That's it. You guys are history.

15:28.959 --> 15:30.667
You guys are just sick!

15:30.750 --> 15:32.667
-
- Aah!

15:33.166 --> 15:34.709
I just want to go home.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.208
You came back!

15:39.375 --> 15:43.291
Yeah. Whether we're worms or warriors,
we stick together.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.417
And we protect our dojo.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.375
I guess we're pretty brave after all.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.625
<i>I said hit me!</i>

15:57.208 --> 15:59.583
<i>Box That Head!</i>

16:00.375 --> 16:03.166
Rudy, you've survived snapping turtles,

16:03.250 --> 16:05.583
hot coals, and a venomous snake.

16:05.667 --> 16:08.375
Now choose your final box.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.375
Okay, uh...

16:11.083 --> 16:13.083
I choose one.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.583
Wait, no, no, no. Uh, two!

16:15.667 --> 16:17.625
Two! All the bad ones have been two.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.041
They wouldn't do that again.

16:19.125 --> 16:22.250
Two, Wink! I outsmarted you! Ha!

16:24.208 --> 16:25.625
Box one.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.667
A couple of marshmallows.

16:27.750 --> 16:28.917
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:29.500 --> 16:31.083
Box three...

16:32.792 --> 16:34.917
Warm towels fresh out of the dryer.

16:37.458 --> 16:38.792
You know what that means?

16:39.125 --> 16:40.583
I do know what that means.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.375
Box two is...

16:45.208 --> 16:48.041
swarming with Panamanian hornets.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.917
Ooh! They're the mean ones.

16:56.834 --> 17:00.834
<i>Okay, if I just stay very still,
maybe I won't disturb them.</i>

17:01.333 --> 17:02.583
<i>Seems to be working.</i>

17:03.375 --> 17:04.750
<i>Just a few more seconds.</i>

17:04.834 --> 17:05.917
How you doing in there, Rudy?

17:10.625 --> 17:13.458
-
- And that's time!

17:17.250 --> 17:19.750
Congratulations, Rudy.
You survived the boxes,

17:19.834 --> 17:23.542
and now you're just
one question away from $50,000.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.667
And here it is.

17:24.750 --> 17:28.500
In martial arts, which color represents
the lowest belt?

17:31.792 --> 17:32.917
Mwai!

17:34.250 --> 17:36.542
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

17:36.625 --> 17:40.500
We were looking for "white" not "mwah".

17:41.375 --> 17:43.000
- Mwai! Mwai!
- Okay.

17:43.083 --> 17:45.250
- Join us next week when we...
- It's mwai!

17:45.333 --> 17:47.375
<i>Box That Head!</i>

17:47.458 --> 17:48.875
Mwai!

17:48.959 --> 17:51.000
Mwai! Mwai!

17:51.125 --> 17:53.083
- Okay. Okay.
- Mwai!

18:01.667 --> 18:04.417
Whoa. A little higher up here
than I thought.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.291
Now what?

18:06.375 --> 18:07.250
I don't know.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.166
He said we'd survive
if we made it to the sign.

18:13.417 --> 18:15.959
All right, we're here,
you crazy nut burger!

18:16.041 --> 18:17.542
Okay, it's over.

18:17.625 --> 18:21.041
We dodged spears, escaped traps,
beat tree fighters, and outran dogs--

18:21.125 --> 18:23.417
And I'm pretty sure I used
poison ivy as toilet paper.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.333
<i>Congratulations.</i>

18:28.417 --> 18:30.208
<i>Ready for the big twist?</i>

18:30.667 --> 18:33.792
<i>Only one of you can be
the star of this movie.</i>

18:33.875 --> 18:36.458
<i>And that is the one who survives.</i>

18:36.875 --> 18:38.208
Survives what?

18:38.291 --> 18:39.667
<i>Each other!</i>

18:39.750 --> 18:41.166
<i>Now fight!</i>

18:42.208 --> 18:43.959
What? That's not gonna happen.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.291
- We're friends...
-

18:45.417 --> 18:46.750
Kim, what are you doing?

18:47.583 --> 18:49.125
Don't... don't fight me!

18:49.208 --> 18:50.375
No!

18:53.583 --> 18:55.041
Stop!

18:58.542 --> 19:00.792
Kim, think about what you're doing!

19:00.875 --> 19:03.875
I am. I'm thinking about being a star.

19:03.959 --> 19:06.083
- So long, Jack.
- No!

19:14.333 --> 19:16.917
Bravo, Kim. Bravo.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.709
You truly are a star.

19:19.041 --> 19:22.083
I'm not just a star.
I'm also a great actress.

19:22.166 --> 19:23.542
Let's not get crazy.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.250
It's true.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.875
I made you believe
that we were actually fighting.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.250
- Wait, you mean...
<i>That's right.</i>

19:31.500 --> 19:33.041
Yak is back.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.709
Whoa!

20:09.917 --> 20:13.041
Wow. I guess his movie ended a little bit
differently than he thought it would.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.333
Yeah.

20:14.375 --> 20:15.500
Can you believe when we got here

20:15.583 --> 20:17.250
we were worried about
who was gonna be the star?

20:17.291 --> 20:18.750
What do you mean "we"?

20:19.250 --> 20:21.291
You're right. I'm sorry.

20:22.208 --> 20:26.667
Look, Jack, I want you to know
I think you're amazing.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.166
<i>Cut!</i>

20:35.750 --> 20:39.291
<i>I cut my leg and it really hurts!</i>

20:40.917 --> 20:42.750
Um, you ready to get out of here?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.125
Let's go home.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.333
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:48.834 --> 20:50.583
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.375
- How you doing? Give me some.
- What's up, man?

20:53.208 --> 20:54.375
How was Hollywood?

20:54.500 --> 20:56.250
Oh, the director turned out to be a maniac

20:56.333 --> 20:58.041
and we sent him to jail
for the rest of his life.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.250
Same old, same old.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.375
Oh, dude! We're missing my favorite show!

21:03.458 --> 21:04.291
Oh.

21:06.291 --> 21:08.375
<i>Box That Head!</i>

21:08.458 --> 21:10.000
What's <i>Box That Head?</i>

21:10.083 --> 21:11.458
Dude, this show is awesome.

21:11.542 --> 21:12.959
Yeah, they get some idiot to believe

21:13.041 --> 21:14.709
that two of the boxes are safe,
but they're not.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.500
All three of them
are full of painful things.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.750
This show is a big practical joke?

21:19.834 --> 21:21.792
Yeah, it's a riot.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.417
Oh!

21:25.625 --> 21:27.625
Where you going with that bo staff?

21:27.709 --> 21:29.500
To see a man named Wink.
