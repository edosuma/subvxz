00:01.539 --> 00:05.222
In 2166, an immortal
tyrant named Vandal Savage

00:05.224 --> 00:07.967
conquered the world and
murdered my wife and child.

00:07.969 --> 00:10.715
I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time

00:10.717 --> 00:12.428
and stop his rise to power.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.696
Unfortunately, my plan
is opposed by the body

00:14.698 --> 00:17.919
I'd sworn my allegiance
to, the Time Masters.

00:17.921 --> 00:20.226
In the future, my
friends may not be heroes,

00:20.228 --> 00:22.150
but if we succeed,

00:22.152 --> 00:25.603
they will be remembered as legends.

00:27.398 --> 00:29.570
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:29.572 --> 00:30.565
Sorry we're late.

00:30.567 --> 00:32.966
Aren't you even a little bit
happy to be back on the ship?

00:32.968 --> 00:35.244
I was happy with that
life we built together.

00:35.246 --> 00:37.098
You think I was hunting
you and your friends

00:37.100 --> 00:39.131
because the Time Masters made me?

00:39.133 --> 00:41.707
They barely had to ask.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.222
Since I failed to bring you in,

00:43.224 --> 00:44.933
the Time Masters want to bring me in.

00:44.935 --> 00:46.928
They're called the Hunters,
and they'll stop at nothing

00:46.930 --> 00:49.818
till every single one of us is
erased from the face of history.

00:49.820 --> 00:52.573
- Do you have any suggestions?
- Run.

00:58.663 --> 01:02.213
_

01:02.215 --> 01:04.705
Aah! It's been quite a
while since I time-jumped

01:04.706 --> 01:07.038
far enough to experience side effects.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.415
Fond memories.

01:08.417 --> 01:10.747
- I can't feel my face.
- Fine feel I.

01:10.749 --> 01:14.230
Linguistic dysplasia,
that should pass shortly.

01:14.232 --> 01:15.795
Better it now.

01:15.797 --> 01:18.602
Am I the only one who
can't feel their face?

01:18.604 --> 01:21.221
I can't feel my... I better not say.

01:21.223 --> 01:23.669
Mr. Rory appears unaffected.

01:23.671 --> 01:25.905
What's going on? We time-jump?

01:25.907 --> 01:27.992
Yeah, we time-jumped.

01:27.994 --> 01:30.205
But "where to?" is the better question.

01:30.207 --> 01:34.848
The town of Salvation,
the Dakota territory, 1871.

01:34.850 --> 01:37.469
I can't believe it... the Old West.

01:37.471 --> 01:40.239
- This isn't going to work.
- It'll buy us time.

01:40.241 --> 01:43.023
We can hide out here while the Hunters
search the other Fragmentations.

01:43.025 --> 01:45.854
What if they decide to
check this place first?

01:45.856 --> 01:49.374
You know, feel free to loop
us in whenever it's convenient.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.978
As you've seen, time doesn't
operate as is generally thought.

01:51.980 --> 01:53.999
It wants to happen. It
takes time to harden.

01:54.001 --> 01:57.742
The... the timeline is unclear on occasion,

01:57.744 --> 01:58.929
constantly in flux.

01:58.931 --> 02:01.665
Hence the difficulty in locating
Savage throughout history.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.389
Indeed. And one of the
other interesting notions

02:03.391 --> 02:05.955
of time travel is the
existence of Fragmentations.

02:05.957 --> 02:08.217
Temporal blind spots,

02:08.220 --> 02:11.278
specific places and times
the Time Masters can't see.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.582
The town of Salvation and
its surrounding environs

02:13.584 --> 02:16.220
are located within one
of these Fragmentations.

02:16.222 --> 02:18.723
So, basically, we're
hiding out in the Old West

02:18.725 --> 02:22.460
and hoping your boogeymen
don't find us here.

02:22.462 --> 02:24.596
The Hunters are not boogeymen.

02:24.598 --> 02:26.664
And you better hope they don't find us.

02:26.666 --> 02:28.071
Well, at least not until I get a chance

02:28.073 --> 02:31.855
to "punch a few doggies"
or "bust a bronco" or two.

02:34.069 --> 02:35.217
Not that I condone animal cruelty.

02:35.219 --> 02:37.151
It's just that I watched
a lot of Westerns as a kid.

02:37.153 --> 02:40.527
Alas, you'll have to enjoy
the Old West from in here,

02:40.529 --> 02:41.545
I'm afraid.

02:41.547 --> 02:43.041
Oh, come on.

02:43.043 --> 02:46.317
What's the harm in us
just taking a look around?

02:46.319 --> 02:47.785
With this group?

02:47.787 --> 02:49.777
Clearly, you haven't been paying attention.

02:49.779 --> 02:52.334
Ugh, if I'm in the Old West
and I don't get to look around,

02:52.336 --> 02:54.032
I'm going to kick myself.

02:54.034 --> 02:56.540
I could help with that.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.793
I'll keep an eye on them. Don't worry.

02:58.795 --> 03:00.795
I'll be a good boy.

03:06.596 --> 03:08.856
I look just like Wyatt Earp.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.528
Now, the fabricator can make clothing,

03:12.530 --> 03:15.046
but you're also going to need
era-appropriate protection.

03:15.048 --> 03:17.322
This era can get a little, uh, rough.

03:17.324 --> 03:19.980
- Oh, six shooters?
- Actually, most guns

03:19.982 --> 03:22.020
of that time period had hammer blocks,

03:22.022 --> 03:23.627
thus reducing the number of shots to five.

03:23.629 --> 03:24.709
Now, this should go without saying,

03:24.711 --> 03:27.184
but considering this group,
I am going to say it...

03:27.186 --> 03:32.717
only use these weapons in the
case of extreme emergencies.

03:32.719 --> 03:34.864
You make it sound like
you're not coming with.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.894
From your duster and
revolver, I'd imagined you

03:36.896 --> 03:39.923
as much an Old West
aficionado as Dr. Palmer.

03:39.925 --> 03:42.302
Indeed I am. But my time
is best spent back here

03:42.304 --> 03:45.455
on the ship, plotting our next
move against Vandal Savage.

03:45.457 --> 03:47.854
Besides, as Mr. Rory says,
it's only a matter of time

03:47.856 --> 03:49.427
before the Hunters find us here.

03:49.429 --> 03:52.164
Don't worry. We're not
going to put down roots.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.224
Yeah, we'll stay out of trouble.

03:54.226 --> 03:57.761
Mm, how I hope and pray that to be true.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:38.260 --> 04:41.152
Yahoo!

04:45.836 --> 04:47.911
Remember, we're just here
to get the lay of the land.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.438
- No trouble.
- Sure that'll happen.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.738
I need a drink.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.235
Wow. It's a real old-timey saloon.

04:55.237 --> 04:56.834
Oh, I beg your pardon.

04:56.836 --> 04:58.377
Not at all, ma'am.

05:06.925 --> 05:08.401
That tastes like gasoline.

05:08.403 --> 05:10.870
Pretty much. Hit me again.

05:12.839 --> 05:15.257
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:15.259 --> 05:16.943
It's no bother.

05:24.442 --> 05:27.583
Time doesn't pass normally
in the Vanishing Point.

05:27.585 --> 05:30.497
It's been years since I've
seen the bottom of a glass.

05:30.499 --> 05:32.962
Years?

05:32.964 --> 05:34.523
How long were you...

05:34.525 --> 05:37.028
Chronos?

05:37.030 --> 05:39.821
Never counted. Doesn't matter.

05:39.823 --> 05:42.187
Turns out it was just another gig anyway.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.531
Doesn't seem like it.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.977
You're different now.

05:48.979 --> 05:50.761
Better or worse?

05:54.702 --> 05:56.335
Don't know yet.

05:59.230 --> 06:02.423
You can handle your liquor. I like that.

06:02.425 --> 06:04.490
I've been on more than a few
dates with guys who thought

06:04.492 --> 06:06.273
we'd get wasted and they'd get lucky,

06:06.275 --> 06:10.781
but somehow they always ended
up the ones under the table.

06:10.783 --> 06:11.995
Mm.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.373
You haven't drunk with me.

06:14.375 --> 06:17.598
Is that a challenge, Mick?

06:17.600 --> 06:19.099
Line them up.

06:21.374 --> 06:23.662
Didn't know you played cards.

06:23.664 --> 06:26.553
Like you, Mr. Snart, I am an enigma.

06:26.555 --> 06:27.853
Raise.

06:31.473 --> 06:33.676
Aha.

06:33.678 --> 06:36.708
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- I'm impressed.

06:36.710 --> 06:38.529
My father was what some might call

06:38.531 --> 06:42.173
a degenerate gambler,
others would say criminal.

06:42.175 --> 06:44.928
When I was old enough, he'd pull
me in on some of his schemes.

06:44.930 --> 06:48.480
I picked up a thing or two at a few
of the card tables he frequented.

06:48.482 --> 06:50.747
Then I took

06:50.749 --> 06:53.404
a different path.

06:53.406 --> 06:56.870
Like father, like son isn't
always inevitable, Mr. Snart.

07:00.989 --> 07:03.699
- I had a full boat.
- As did I.

07:03.701 --> 07:06.548
Full of kings, which
beats your pair of queens.

07:09.151 --> 07:10.649
Don't I look busy to you?

07:10.651 --> 07:12.249
I'm sorry. I...

07:12.251 --> 07:14.669
You spill another drop of
that whiskey, and you will be.

07:14.671 --> 07:19.055
Just because you're losing doesn't
mean you have to pick on the waitstaff.

07:19.057 --> 07:21.393
Mind your own business, grandpa.

07:21.395 --> 07:23.214
Unhand the lady.

07:23.216 --> 07:25.831
Now, now, boys, let's just take it easy.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.592
Oh, when my friend here
is being reasonable,

07:27.594 --> 07:29.039
we know we have a problem.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.894
I'm not the one with the problem.

07:30.896 --> 07:32.355
You are.

07:38.883 --> 07:41.307
You killed him.

07:41.309 --> 07:43.283
You're welcome.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.351
Clearly, the deceased
was a friend of yours,

07:51.353 --> 07:52.344
but my friend here...

07:52.346 --> 07:54.277
Your friend drew first,

07:54.279 --> 07:55.879
got put down.

07:55.881 --> 07:57.271
It was a clean shot.

07:57.273 --> 07:59.169
Do we look like we care about clean?

07:59.171 --> 08:01.888
He has a point.

08:26.782 --> 08:29.593
All right!

08:29.595 --> 08:31.343
Playtime's over.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.773
Anybody's got a problem with that,

08:33.775 --> 08:35.607
they answer to me.

08:40.448 --> 08:41.861
Thank you,

08:41.863 --> 08:43.236
Mister...

08:43.239 --> 08:45.024
Hex.

08:45.026 --> 08:46.627
Jonah Hex.

08:46.629 --> 08:49.107
You're not from around here, are you?

08:49.109 --> 08:50.316
No.

08:50.318 --> 08:52.571
My friends and I are, uh...

08:52.573 --> 08:54.373
from out of town.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.710
Way out of town.

08:58.586 --> 09:00.012
All right.

09:00.014 --> 09:02.617
Why don't you folks tell
me where you're really from?

09:02.619 --> 09:05.135
I'm not sure that's any
of your business, sir.

09:05.137 --> 09:08.272
Let me rephrase that.

09:08.274 --> 09:11.459
Tell me when y'all from.

09:11.461 --> 09:14.425
You seven stick out like a dog in a manger.

09:14.427 --> 09:16.717
Like he said, we're not from around here.

09:16.719 --> 09:20.085
You think you're the first time
travelers I've ever come across?

09:20.087 --> 09:22.533
Uh, yes.

09:22.535 --> 09:24.166
Where is he?

09:24.168 --> 09:26.604
I got some words that need saying.

09:26.606 --> 09:27.972
Where is who?

09:29.843 --> 09:31.943
Rip Hunter.

09:40.069 --> 09:42.981
What is it about you people that
whenever we go to a new timeline,

09:42.983 --> 09:46.573
you feel the need to pick up...

09:46.575 --> 09:48.478
strays?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.834
Nice.

09:50.836 --> 09:53.153
I didn't get to see it last time around.

09:53.155 --> 09:53.931
Last time?

09:53.933 --> 09:55.779
A long story, which we will not be telling.

09:55.781 --> 09:58.186
My coat suits you good.

09:58.188 --> 09:59.554
What are you doing here, Jonah?

09:59.556 --> 10:01.882
Collecting on a bounty,

10:01.884 --> 10:03.783
wetting my whistle,

10:03.785 --> 10:06.726
when your friends here
got in a lot of trouble.

10:06.728 --> 10:10.029
We might've gotten into a
barroom brawl back in town.

10:10.031 --> 10:12.645
Well, that was entirely predictable.

10:12.647 --> 10:16.319
One of them poured lead into a
member of the Stillwater gang.

10:16.321 --> 10:18.349
- Mr. Rory.
- Snart, actually.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.903
Oh, that was gonna be my next guess.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.797
This guy tried to kill Grey.

10:21.799 --> 10:23.483
Snart saved him.

10:23.485 --> 10:27.081
And brought this town a whole
lot of hell in the bargain.

10:27.083 --> 10:30.009
Those boys you were trading
hands with in the saloon...

10:30.011 --> 10:32.365
they're all members of the Stillwater gang.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.324
Why can't a gang ever
be a bunch of good guys?

10:34.326 --> 10:36.300
Jeb Stillwater and his friends

10:36.302 --> 10:39.230
been raiding this town
for the past three months.

10:39.232 --> 10:42.440
Stealing, robbing, killing.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.446
Well, he'll have to go through us.

10:44.448 --> 10:47.191
No, he won't.

10:47.193 --> 10:49.246
No doubt your... your little ruckus

10:49.248 --> 10:50.616
has already placed the timeline at risk,

10:50.618 --> 10:52.905
to say nothing of potentially
alerting the Hunters

10:52.907 --> 10:54.271
to our presence here.

10:54.273 --> 10:57.410
Sounds like someone's planning
on busting out of town again.

10:57.412 --> 10:58.670
Leaving already?

10:58.672 --> 11:00.167
No. No.

11:00.169 --> 11:03.883
Look, this town is being
terrorized by the Stillwater gang.

11:03.885 --> 11:05.498
And I aim to do something about it.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.080
You "aim to"?

11:07.082 --> 11:09.212
You getting all native on us, Haircut?

11:09.214 --> 11:11.308
Look, we signed on to this mission...

11:11.310 --> 11:12.771
To stop Vandal Savage.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.517
To be heroes.

11:14.519 --> 11:17.297
And saving a town from a
marauding gang of criminals...

11:17.299 --> 11:18.935
that is what heroes do.

11:20.904 --> 11:24.937
Quite a posse of saints you're
riding along with nowadays.

11:26.443 --> 11:28.139
Hey. Bridge is, uh, that way.

11:28.141 --> 11:30.045
Yeah, I'm not going to
the bridge. I'm, uh...

11:30.047 --> 11:31.081
Where am I going, Gideon?

11:31.083 --> 11:34.531
The valley you described is
consistent with Albano Gulch.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.781
Yeah, there.

11:35.783 --> 11:38.650
Okay, wait. Why?

11:38.652 --> 11:40.921
Back at the saloon, I ran into a woman,

11:40.923 --> 11:43.945
and she caused me to have
more memory flashes, so...

11:43.947 --> 11:46.991
I think I might have known
her in one of my past lives.

11:46.993 --> 11:49.694
And if so, she might be
able to help me find Carter.

11:49.696 --> 11:52.880
Wait. So you're just gonna run
out there and try and find her?

11:52.882 --> 11:55.328
Actually, I was planning on flying.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.761
You want a partner in crime?

11:57.763 --> 11:59.297
Okay, fine.

11:59.299 --> 12:01.498
But you're definitely not carrying me.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.629
How do you propose we get there?

12:11.041 --> 12:11.975
Howdy.

12:11.977 --> 12:14.885
I'm Ray... John Wayne.

12:16.337 --> 12:19.222
What do you want, Mr. Wayne?

12:19.224 --> 12:21.856
Well, I, uh... I reckon you could use

12:21.858 --> 12:24.294
another hand with the Stillwater gang.

12:25.708 --> 12:29.579
You boys have any experience
with law enforcement?

12:29.581 --> 12:33.044
Well, I have a fair bit of
experience fighting crime.

12:33.046 --> 12:35.638
Congratulations, then.

12:39.385 --> 12:40.941
You're making me your deputy?

12:40.943 --> 12:44.308
Nope. Just made you the new sheriff.

12:44.310 --> 12:45.958
- Excuse me. What?
- Stillwater gang

12:45.960 --> 12:49.050
has been shooting up
this town for months now.

12:49.052 --> 12:51.060
It's only by the grace of the good Lord

12:51.062 --> 12:54.780
that I'm not pushing up daisies myself.

12:54.782 --> 12:58.527
And I am done with pushing my luck.

12:58.529 --> 13:01.063
But you're the...

13:01.065 --> 13:01.875
sheriff.

13:01.877 --> 13:04.662
Congratulations.

13:04.664 --> 13:06.268
By the way,

13:06.270 --> 13:10.189
you might find a warrant or two
out for me around these parts.

13:10.191 --> 13:14.110
You know, we have stuff back on the
ship that can fix your... you know...

13:14.112 --> 13:16.654
Fix what?

13:16.656 --> 13:19.782
Yep. Nothing. Never mind.

13:28.142 --> 13:29.442
What can I get you?

13:29.444 --> 13:31.485
Information.

13:31.487 --> 13:33.760
Some friends of mine are
looking for Jeb Stillwater.

13:33.762 --> 13:35.806
If they're the same friends
that shot Billy Conlon

13:35.808 --> 13:37.780
and beat on the Stillwater posse,

13:37.782 --> 13:40.068
I can guarantee you he'll find you.

13:40.070 --> 13:44.554
That being said, we'd very
much like to find him first.

13:44.556 --> 13:46.962
You got any more of them greenbacks?

13:50.744 --> 13:51.786
Let me go find a map.

13:56.858 --> 14:00.571
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you all right?

14:00.573 --> 14:01.847
I'm fine.

14:01.849 --> 14:04.175
I just want to be alone.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.659
I understand.

14:05.661 --> 14:07.589
I'm new to these parts.

14:07.591 --> 14:12.651
I didn't think it was customary
for a lady to drink alone.

14:12.653 --> 14:14.201
Tonic water.

14:14.203 --> 14:16.412
It's for my son.

14:16.414 --> 14:19.916
I just needed a moment to myself.

14:19.918 --> 14:22.442
Is everything all right?

14:22.444 --> 14:24.501
I should be getting back to my boy.

14:24.503 --> 14:27.472
If there's something wrong with
him, perhaps I can be of assistance.

14:27.474 --> 14:30.290
I happen to be a scientist.

14:30.292 --> 14:32.152
That's kind.

14:32.154 --> 14:34.554
But I'm afraid there's nothing you can do.

14:34.556 --> 14:37.460
My boy is going to die.

14:37.462 --> 14:39.514
What's wrong with him?

14:45.041 --> 14:47.778
He has the consumption, they say.

14:47.780 --> 14:49.291
Tuberculosis.

14:49.293 --> 14:53.220
He's been like this on and
off for about a year now.

14:53.222 --> 14:56.803
He always wanted to see the American West.

14:56.805 --> 15:00.677
Our doctor thought a constitutional
might do him some good.

15:00.679 --> 15:02.837
It hasn't, clearly.

15:02.839 --> 15:03.708
You know, there are medicines that...

15:03.710 --> 15:06.671
The doctor here says he has a day...

15:06.673 --> 15:09.369
maybe two, if he's lucky.

15:09.371 --> 15:12.751
Does he look lucky to you, Mister...

15:12.753 --> 15:14.832
I don't know your name.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.728
It's Martin.

15:19.469 --> 15:20.780
Hello, young man.

15:20.782 --> 15:22.506
We call him Bertie.

15:22.508 --> 15:24.944
Bertie.

15:24.946 --> 15:28.089
Your mother tells me you
wanted to come out west.

15:28.091 --> 15:32.070
Can't imagine you've seen much of it yet.

15:32.072 --> 15:35.179
I want to ride a stagecoach.

15:35.181 --> 15:37.841
Well, in that case...

15:37.843 --> 15:40.226
I encourage you to get better.

15:40.228 --> 15:42.881
My mum... she's not sure I will.

15:44.676 --> 15:48.418
Well, then you must
prove your mother wrong...

15:48.420 --> 15:51.228
so you can ride that stagecoach.

16:07.433 --> 16:09.557
One of mine is dead.

16:09.559 --> 16:11.186
And this here town's gonna pay.

16:20.085 --> 16:22.717
Now, who the hell are you supposed to be?

16:22.719 --> 16:24.221
John Wayne...

16:24.223 --> 16:26.340
Salvation's new sheriff.

16:26.342 --> 16:30.237
And this here town is under my protection.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.492
Well, you being new and all,

16:32.494 --> 16:35.098
you don't know about the
arrangement that we got.

16:35.100 --> 16:38.311
See, me and my boys, we ride into town,

16:38.313 --> 16:40.319
we take whatever we want.

16:40.321 --> 16:42.196
In exchange for what?

16:42.198 --> 16:44.364
Not killing nobody.

16:44.366 --> 16:47.851
Well, that sounds reasonable and all,

16:47.853 --> 16:50.724
but arrangement's over.

16:50.726 --> 16:54.024
Arrangement's over, boys.

16:54.026 --> 16:57.207
They teach you numbers
where it is you're from?

16:57.209 --> 16:58.733
'Cause the way I see it,

16:58.735 --> 17:00.550
there's only one of you

17:00.552 --> 17:02.196
and a whole mess of us.

17:07.329 --> 17:09.407
You get out of town,
and you don't come back,

17:09.410 --> 17:11.910
or the next bullet goes in your eye.

17:11.912 --> 17:15.255
I got sharpshooters all around.

17:15.257 --> 17:17.582
You really want to test me?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.387
Let's ride, boys.

17:26.327 --> 17:27.125
Hyah!

17:36.035 --> 17:37.636
Nice, Haircut.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.712
Dude, that was badass.

17:41.714 --> 17:43.614
Let's not oversell it.

17:43.616 --> 17:44.981
Running a bad guy out of town's always been

17:44.983 --> 17:47.066
- on my bucket list.
- "Bucket list"?

17:47.068 --> 17:50.688
A list of things one hopes
to accomplish before they die.

17:50.690 --> 17:52.985
Well, you better hope it's a
real short list, String Bean.

17:52.987 --> 17:55.094
We can handle the Stillwater gang.

17:55.096 --> 17:58.576
Well, you're all just tearing
up the 1870s, aren't you?

17:58.578 --> 18:00.900
Stillwater and his gang's
like a hornets' nest,

18:00.902 --> 18:03.415
and your friends here keep poking at it.

18:03.417 --> 18:05.679
They saved the town from being raided, man.

18:05.681 --> 18:08.395
Today, but what about tomorrow...

18:08.397 --> 18:10.353
or the day after that?

18:10.355 --> 18:11.883
For a bunch of time travelers,

18:11.885 --> 18:14.681
you don't seem to
understand the future much.

18:14.683 --> 18:18.945
The day will come when you'll all leave...

18:18.947 --> 18:21.984
and Salvation will end up like Calvert.

18:21.986 --> 18:23.339
What's a Calvert?

18:23.341 --> 18:25.748
A closed matter.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.321
A word, Mr. Hex?

18:28.323 --> 18:30.954
I believe you've all
done enough for one day.

18:35.344 --> 18:38.123
Well, now I definitely want
to know what a Calvert is.

18:38.125 --> 18:42.390
Then it's a good thing we have
access to a supercomputer. Gideon?

18:42.392 --> 18:45.845
Calvert was a town in Oklahoma circa 1868.

18:45.847 --> 18:46.602
"Was"?

18:58.865 --> 19:01.406
You know, there's something
weird going on with your face.

19:01.408 --> 19:02.368
What?

19:02.370 --> 19:04.965
You're smiling.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.697
I didn't know you could do that.

19:06.699 --> 19:08.590
Well, don't tell anyone my secret.

19:10.569 --> 19:13.502
It's just all of this...

19:13.504 --> 19:16.697
it's so pure, so simple.

19:16.699 --> 19:17.656
I'd say I miss simple,

19:17.658 --> 19:21.264
but I guess you have to experience
something first to miss it.

19:21.266 --> 19:23.371
I know what you mean.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.869
I've been having more and
more memory flashes lately,

19:25.871 --> 19:28.985
and I'm not entirely sure why.

19:28.987 --> 19:32.546
Well, if this woman was a
friend of yours in a past life,

19:32.548 --> 19:35.583
hopefully she'll have
another piece for your puzzle.

19:39.508 --> 19:41.955
I feel like I'm being drawn to this place.

19:41.957 --> 19:43.858
Which way?

19:43.860 --> 19:44.942
There.

19:56.352 --> 19:58.887
You know, stealing's against the law.

19:58.889 --> 20:00.617
I'm the sheriff of these here parts.

20:00.619 --> 20:03.388
How did you know I was
appropriating this medicine?

20:03.390 --> 20:05.307
That was my fault, Professor.

20:05.309 --> 20:07.115
Et tu, Gideon?

20:07.117 --> 20:08.717
I suppose this is going
to earn me a lecture

20:08.719 --> 20:11.051
on the perils of upsetting the timeline

20:11.053 --> 20:13.795
by introducing futuristic
medicine to the 19th century.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.356
Well, it seems you've
already given it to yourself.

20:15.358 --> 20:17.686
Except this isn't futuristic medicine.

20:17.688 --> 20:20.318
I've had Gideon fabricate
simple streptomycin for me.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.872
Excuse me.

20:21.874 --> 20:24.651
Which won't be used in medical
treatments for another 70 years.

20:24.653 --> 20:28.143
This is about a boy in town who's
dying of an easily curable disease.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.381
Just as you couldn't turn
your back on Jeb Stillwater

20:30.383 --> 20:32.967
and his gang, I can't turn
mine on this boy and his mother.

20:32.969 --> 20:35.273
Except Dr. Palmer is using
19th-century technology

20:35.275 --> 20:36.948
to deal with Stillwater, whereas you...

20:36.950 --> 20:39.165
Just spare me the lecture, Captain Hunter.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.130
You, of all people...

20:41.132 --> 20:43.309
This isn't about the mission, Martin!

20:43.311 --> 20:45.087
Do you not recall happened when Dr. Palmer

20:45.089 --> 20:47.573
left a bit of his suit back in 1975

20:47.575 --> 20:49.581
and nearly destroyed Central City?

20:49.583 --> 20:51.067
That was an accident.

20:51.069 --> 20:55.922
I'm not talking about our mission
or Dr. Palmer's technological gaffe.

20:55.924 --> 20:57.698
Calvert...

20:57.700 --> 21:00.334
that town clearly holds some
emotional resonance for you,

21:00.336 --> 21:02.845
judging from the looks you've
been exchanging with Mr. Hex.

21:02.847 --> 21:04.620
How do you know it's a town?

21:04.622 --> 21:05.921
Gideon?

21:08.966 --> 21:11.679
Calvert, Oklahoma...

21:11.681 --> 21:13.749
what happened to you there, Rip?

21:13.751 --> 21:17.017
And why is it so important to you?

21:17.019 --> 21:20.614
Because the past is prologue.

21:20.616 --> 21:22.535
It's not uncommon for criminal posses

21:22.537 --> 21:25.186
such as Mr. Stillwater's
to sack and pillage towns

21:25.188 --> 21:28.376
which they find uncooperative.

21:28.378 --> 21:30.741
So Stillwater's done this before?

21:30.743 --> 21:35.118
In the case of Calvert, it
was Quentin Turnbull's doing.

21:35.120 --> 21:37.114
But it was my fault.

21:37.116 --> 21:39.824
I'd come to Calvert on a
mission from the Time Masters.

21:39.826 --> 21:43.958
This was years before
my son Jonas was born.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.593
Jonas...

21:45.595 --> 21:48.068
Did you name your son after Hex?

21:48.070 --> 21:50.300
After my mission was completed,

21:50.302 --> 21:51.596
I felt unable to leave.

21:51.598 --> 21:55.455
I'd grown so attached to this era...

21:55.457 --> 21:58.687
a victim of the same time
drift you experienced in 1958.

21:58.689 --> 22:00.762
But obviously you left at some point.

22:00.764 --> 22:05.694
Left? I had to tear myself
away from the time period

22:05.696 --> 22:09.942
for fear that I would never see
my then-future wife, Miranda,

22:09.944 --> 22:11.451
ever again.

22:14.576 --> 22:18.643
Turnbull attacked
Calvert the very next day.

22:18.645 --> 22:20.359
So...

22:20.361 --> 22:22.135
you can understand why I must act.

22:22.137 --> 22:24.099
No, Martin, I don't.

22:24.101 --> 22:26.937
As I said before, this is advanced
medicine unsuitable to the period,

22:26.939 --> 22:30.301
to say nothing of what this boy's
survival might do to the timeline.

22:30.303 --> 22:32.064
Be that as it may,

22:32.066 --> 22:33.961
I refuse to live with the regret

22:33.963 --> 22:36.931
I see on your face right now.

22:40.937 --> 22:44.232
The information Mr. Stein
got from the barkeep paid out.

22:44.234 --> 22:46.296
I know where the
Stillwater gang's holed up.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.467
All right. Let's ride.

22:48.469 --> 22:50.101
Up high.

22:51.324 --> 22:53.640
You coming, Rip?

22:59.138 --> 23:02.015
That's what I thought.

23:18.073 --> 23:21.655
I wonder why she lives
alone all the way out here.

23:21.657 --> 23:23.342
Because...

23:23.344 --> 23:25.540
I value my privacy!

23:25.542 --> 23:26.669
Wait, wait, wait.

23:26.671 --> 23:28.462
Don't you remember me...

23:28.464 --> 23:30.553
from the saloon back in Salvation?

23:30.555 --> 23:33.008
I remembered you, you
wigged-out little girl.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.462
If I'd wanted to talk to you then,
I would have talked to you then.

23:35.464 --> 23:37.292
I ain't fixing to talk to you now.

23:37.294 --> 23:38.985
Now, get off of my land!

23:38.987 --> 23:41.258
Listen, we're not trying
to start any trouble.

23:41.260 --> 23:44.027
Do you want that pretty little
mouth of yours filled with lead?

23:44.029 --> 23:46.877
Your friend has a colorful personality.

23:46.879 --> 23:51.018
I ain't got friends. I keep to myself.

23:53.134 --> 23:55.290
She's right.

23:55.292 --> 23:58.738
She wasn't my friend.

23:58.740 --> 24:01.240
I was her.

24:06.911 --> 24:10.892
We sat for that picture
at the county fair, 1830.

24:10.894 --> 24:12.802
He looked like such a gentleman.

24:12.804 --> 24:13.905
What was his name?

24:13.907 --> 24:15.278
Hannibal.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.936
Hannibal Hawkes.

24:16.938 --> 24:18.467
And what happened?

24:18.469 --> 24:20.735
Was it Savage?

24:22.306 --> 24:24.432
What is this?

24:24.434 --> 24:26.322
It looks familiar.

24:26.324 --> 24:29.243
That was ours in our first life.

24:34.346 --> 24:35.527
I remember.

24:35.529 --> 24:37.217
We crossed with Savage in Jefferson City.

24:37.219 --> 24:38.790
He had it with him.

24:38.792 --> 24:41.335
We escaped with it and our lives.

24:41.337 --> 24:42.897
Do you still have it?

24:42.899 --> 24:45.029
We lost it to bandits about a year later.

24:45.031 --> 24:47.316
We heard that the Pinkertons
were after the same bandits,

24:47.318 --> 24:48.535
but we just...

24:48.537 --> 24:52.023
Hey. What is it?

24:52.025 --> 24:54.300
Objects present at the moment of my...

24:54.302 --> 24:55.902
our first death

24:55.904 --> 24:58.254
can be used to kill Savage.

24:58.256 --> 25:00.041
So, if I can get my hands
on that bracelet, then...

25:00.043 --> 25:03.210
You're going to try to
kill Savage with a bracelet?

25:04.544 --> 25:06.142
You need to stop.

25:06.144 --> 25:09.597
- Stop what?
- Fighting our destiny.

25:09.599 --> 25:11.091
Ain't destiny what brought you here?

25:11.093 --> 25:13.521
What part of destiny is she fighting?

25:13.523 --> 25:15.333
All of it.

25:15.335 --> 25:17.391
We get reborn. We find
Hannibal... Carter...

25:17.393 --> 25:20.094
then Savage finds us, and then we die.

25:20.096 --> 25:21.992
That's... that's the way it is.

25:21.994 --> 25:24.418
It's the way it's always gonna be.

25:24.420 --> 25:25.908
I don't believe that.

25:25.910 --> 25:28.023
Well, I have a few more years on you.

25:28.025 --> 25:29.653
You can't break the cycle.

25:29.655 --> 25:31.304
That's why I live out here, alone.

25:31.306 --> 25:34.924
For the rest of your life?

25:34.926 --> 25:38.253
Well, I guess I had to
figure that out the hard way.

25:38.255 --> 25:42.073
I was still a young woman
when Savage left me a widow.

25:42.075 --> 25:45.340
Instead of waiting for
him to find me and kill me

25:45.342 --> 25:47.953
so that I could love my
Hannibal in the next life,

25:47.955 --> 25:50.421
I tried to find love in this one.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.651
Talk about a curse.

25:52.653 --> 25:55.103
What happened?

25:55.105 --> 25:57.814
He was a good man, but
he wasn't a soul mate.

25:57.816 --> 26:00.331
It was like fate was
trying to break us apart.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.434
Eventually, fate broke both our hearts.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.188
So I made a promise to myself

26:06.190 --> 26:09.039
that I wasn't gonna do
that to a person again.

26:09.948 --> 26:12.847
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

26:12.849 --> 26:15.943
No, I'm who's sorry...

26:15.945 --> 26:18.569
to have to be the one to let you know

26:18.571 --> 26:21.545
that you're never going to be
able to love anyone else, ever.

26:21.547 --> 26:25.145
How much do you know
about our previous lives?

26:25.147 --> 26:27.805
I reckon not a lot because
you didn't recognize me,

26:27.807 --> 26:30.739
so let me tell you that
we did love other men...

26:30.741 --> 26:32.209
loved them real and pure,

26:32.211 --> 26:35.346
but it never ended well, not ever.

26:35.348 --> 26:38.335
Tragedy or heartbreak...

26:38.337 --> 26:42.339
that's how it always ends
if the man's not Carter.

26:47.579 --> 26:49.927
We could've used Sara on this roundup.

26:49.929 --> 26:51.573
A lady? You crazy?

26:51.575 --> 26:55.121
Just remember, we're here to
arrest Stillwater, not kill him.

26:55.123 --> 26:57.219
He always this much of a stick in the mud?

26:57.221 --> 26:58.688
Yes.

27:03.327 --> 27:05.895
How? It's a miracle.

27:05.897 --> 27:09.265
Oh, it's... it's not a
miracle, I can assure you.

27:09.267 --> 27:10.676
Uh, M-Mrs. Neal...

27:10.678 --> 27:12.227
Sarah.

27:12.229 --> 27:15.063
Sarah...

27:15.065 --> 27:17.754
when the illness is gone,

27:17.756 --> 27:20.065
I need you to promise me
that you'll take what's left

27:20.067 --> 27:23.632
of the medicine and burn it,
vials and all. Do you understand?

27:23.634 --> 27:26.034
Yes. Yes, I shall do it.

27:28.752 --> 27:31.407
Sarah...

27:31.409 --> 27:33.135
I wish you well.

27:33.137 --> 27:35.315
Thank you.

27:35.317 --> 27:37.389
I really must be going.

27:54.043 --> 27:55.475
Oh, damn.

28:02.271 --> 28:04.065
These boys got some stones.

28:35.042 --> 28:36.476
Jeb Stillwater, you are under arrest.

28:36.478 --> 28:37.510
You have the right to remain silent.

28:37.512 --> 28:38.507
You have the right to an attorney.

28:38.509 --> 28:41.944
There won't be Miranda
rights for another 100 years.

28:41.946 --> 28:44.814
Fall back! Fall back!

28:53.331 --> 28:54.683
Jax!

29:01.262 --> 29:02.988
- We got to go!
- Not without Jax!

29:02.990 --> 29:05.202
Well, we got Stillwater.
It means we got leverage.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.380
Live to fight another day or die tonight...

29:07.382 --> 29:08.346
your choice.

29:08.348 --> 29:09.214
Hyah!

29:17.398 --> 29:18.524
Where is Stillwater?

29:18.526 --> 29:20.117
He's knocked out cold in the med bay.

29:20.119 --> 29:21.220
Well, this is a simple matter.

29:21.222 --> 29:24.084
We trade Stillwater for
Jefferson as Mr. Hex suggested.

29:24.086 --> 29:25.434
It's not that simple.

29:25.436 --> 29:26.997
If we release Stillwater,
we're back to square one

29:26.999 --> 29:28.470
and the town is still in danger.

29:28.472 --> 29:29.916
So is the kid.

29:29.918 --> 29:32.934
And we'll figure out a way to get
him back without releasing Stillwater.

29:32.936 --> 29:35.481
I got a notion.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.552
Set up a quick draw.

29:37.554 --> 29:39.485
You win,

29:39.487 --> 29:41.206
get your guy back.

29:41.208 --> 29:42.795
You lose,

29:42.797 --> 29:44.553
you set Stillwater free.

29:44.555 --> 29:46.041
And, by "lose," you mean...

29:46.043 --> 29:47.450
Get shot and killed.

29:47.452 --> 29:49.100
Oh, great. Pistols at high noon.

29:49.102 --> 29:51.163
Finally, someone's talking sense.

29:51.165 --> 29:53.412
There has to be another way, a better way.

29:53.414 --> 29:55.305
Sure.

29:55.307 --> 29:59.042
Go after Stillwater with all
your gear from the future.

29:59.044 --> 30:01.658
I don't know how that'll sit
with your captain, though.

30:01.660 --> 30:04.014
Mm, let's assume it's a bad idea.

30:04.016 --> 30:06.549
So who's standing in the
middle of Main Street?

30:06.551 --> 30:08.060
I'll do it.

30:08.062 --> 30:10.875
Raymond, now is not the time to
indulge your cowboy fantasies.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.414
No one else is stepping forward.

30:13.416 --> 30:15.646
Plus, I'm a decent shot...

30:15.648 --> 30:17.638
at least I was with an air rifle.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.656
I can't believe you're encouraging this.

30:19.658 --> 30:20.988
You know it's the only way.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.650
Dr. Palmer's going to get himself killed.

30:22.652 --> 30:24.445
I think you forfeited
your right to an opinion

30:24.447 --> 30:26.969
when you refused to leave the
ship since we've been here.

30:26.971 --> 30:28.398
I had good reason.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.766
Because of Calvert.

30:29.768 --> 30:31.885
Yes, but not in the way you think.

30:31.887 --> 30:35.321
Leaving Calvert, leaving this... era

30:35.323 --> 30:37.906
is one of the hardest
things I've ever had to do.

30:37.908 --> 30:42.130
And why is that, Captain?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.732
A Time Master is trained to do
his work without interference,

30:44.734 --> 30:47.789
which means not helping
people or being a hero.

30:47.791 --> 30:52.886
But as you've seen, Dr. Palmer, this era
offers many opportunities for heroism.

30:52.888 --> 30:55.498
I found it...

30:55.500 --> 30:57.398
enticing.

30:57.400 --> 31:01.352
And you still managed to leave.

31:01.354 --> 31:04.522
Something's been bugging
me all these years.

31:04.524 --> 31:06.233
If you'd have known what
Turnbull was going to do

31:06.235 --> 31:09.838
to Calvert, would you have left?

31:11.815 --> 31:15.209
That's the thing, Jonah.

31:15.211 --> 31:16.677
I did know.

31:19.755 --> 31:20.860
I deserve that.

31:20.862 --> 31:22.351
You deserve a lot worse.

31:22.353 --> 31:23.791
You knew, and you still left?

31:23.793 --> 31:25.792
Of course I knew. I was a Time Master.

31:25.794 --> 31:28.451
And therein lay the problem.
Like Raymond, like Martin,

31:28.453 --> 31:30.928
I felt the pull of heroism,
of this era's penchant

31:30.930 --> 31:34.101
for being rife with opportunities
to make a difference.

31:34.103 --> 31:35.374
That's one of the things that called to me,

31:35.376 --> 31:38.271
and that is why I had to leave.

31:39.868 --> 31:43.388
Because had I stayed...

31:43.390 --> 31:46.257
I could no longer have
remained a Time Master.

31:51.543 --> 31:54.899
But I'm no longer a Time Master...

31:54.901 --> 31:56.483
which is why I'll face Stillwater.

31:56.485 --> 31:58.425
Wait. I said that I would do it.

31:58.427 --> 31:59.432
And get yourself shot and killed?

31:59.434 --> 32:02.960
It's appreciated, but I'd
rather you stayed alive.

32:02.962 --> 32:06.815
Send word to Stillwater's posse.

32:06.817 --> 32:09.568
I believe high noon is
in less than three hours.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.209
You want to talk about it?

32:21.211 --> 32:23.010
Not really.

32:26.130 --> 32:28.999
You don't have to listen to her, you know?

32:29.001 --> 32:31.523
Is this you not talking about it?

32:31.525 --> 32:37.896
No. This is me ignoring you saying
you don't want to talk about it.

32:37.898 --> 32:40.197
Look, I get it.

32:40.199 --> 32:43.861
Things may have gone very
wrong for Old West you

32:43.863 --> 32:46.883
and whoever she loved who wasn't Carter.

32:46.885 --> 32:48.156
But?

32:48.158 --> 32:51.980
But Old West you didn't know Ray Palmer.

32:51.982 --> 32:54.896
She didn't love Ray Palmer.

32:54.898 --> 32:56.783
You do.

32:56.785 --> 32:59.495
And you have to live your life.

32:59.497 --> 33:01.495
She already lived hers.

33:10.966 --> 33:13.133
You think Hunter can pull this off?

33:13.135 --> 33:14.955
Reasonably.

33:14.957 --> 33:19.469
If not, I got dibs on that
newfangled revolver of his.

33:31.450 --> 33:34.602
You sure about this?

33:34.604 --> 33:37.165
Well, if anything, it feels
good to be out here again,

33:37.167 --> 33:38.354
in this era.

33:38.356 --> 33:41.697
Well, don't get too attached.

33:41.699 --> 33:44.994
That is what I keep telling myself.

33:44.996 --> 33:47.912
I'll be drawing for Sheriff Palmer.

33:47.914 --> 33:51.151
How do me and my boys know
you're going to keep your word?

33:51.153 --> 33:53.696
Sheriff Palmer's a straight shooter.

33:53.698 --> 33:57.572
Then he should be the one in the street.

34:52.505 --> 34:54.411
Jefferson, are you all right?

34:54.413 --> 34:55.656
Yeah.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.371
Did you just shoot somebody for me?

34:57.373 --> 35:01.857
Yeah. You're welcome.

35:01.859 --> 35:04.037
I don't think we're done here yet.

35:07.685 --> 35:08.508
Oh, no.

35:14.937 --> 35:17.003
They found us.

35:27.303 --> 35:30.327
Ah, friends! Welcome.

35:30.329 --> 35:33.596
I think you'll find this slightly more
effective than your current sidearm.

35:33.598 --> 35:35.626
Yes, I will be wanting
that back, by the way.

35:35.628 --> 35:36.887
And you'll be needing this.

35:36.889 --> 35:39.674
What about revealing our
future tech to the locals?

35:39.676 --> 35:42.006
It doesn't seem to bother them. Shall we?

35:54.835 --> 35:56.367
What about our guns?

35:56.369 --> 35:59.006
Sorry. Grabbed what I could.

36:12.952 --> 36:13.912
That's what's up!

36:13.914 --> 36:15.905
Y'all better stay the hell away from us!

36:15.907 --> 36:17.714
Calm down, Jefferson.

36:24.285 --> 36:26.126
- Traitor!
- Not possible.

36:26.128 --> 36:29.029
I was never on your side. I was on my side.

36:44.781 --> 36:48.115
- You'll never win!
- Wake up, pal. We already did.

36:58.436 --> 37:02.671
Fool. The Time Masters have
initiated Omega Protocol.

37:02.673 --> 37:05.341
The Pilgrim's coming for you, Chronos.

37:05.343 --> 37:09.011
Your deaths are just a matter of time.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.136
Yeah, yeah.

37:15.535 --> 37:17.298
Well, that was easy.

37:25.947 --> 37:28.903
- You're not staying.
- Are you?

37:28.905 --> 37:31.199
Me? You know I can't.

37:31.201 --> 37:34.055
But this town still needs a sheriff.

37:34.057 --> 37:38.065
Well, I'm not the
law-and-order type...

37:38.067 --> 37:41.278
nor the staying-in-one-place
type either.

37:41.280 --> 37:45.761
Well, we have that much in common at least.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.396
At least.

37:49.817 --> 37:52.243
Be well, Jonah.

37:52.245 --> 37:53.766
Nice thing about my world...

37:53.768 --> 37:57.002
for you, it ain't going anywhere.

37:57.004 --> 38:01.598
Ah, perhaps we will see
each other again, my friend.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.159
Yeah.

38:03.161 --> 38:05.062
I reckon that'd be okay.

38:14.134 --> 38:17.099
Interesting fella.

38:17.101 --> 38:18.612
Indeed.

38:18.614 --> 38:21.166
This town's seen a lot of interesting.

38:21.168 --> 38:22.867
Suppose you got one of those doohickies

38:22.869 --> 38:27.071
that erases people's memories or something?

38:27.073 --> 38:29.200
No. But...

38:29.202 --> 38:31.990
skepticism and disbelief are
a far more effective tool.

38:31.992 --> 38:36.627
Ah. So, if anybody here talks,
no one will believe them.

38:36.629 --> 38:39.462
Would you, Mr. Snart?

38:41.034 --> 38:44.680
I'm not going to pretend
to understand what I saw.

38:44.682 --> 38:48.468
I'd prefer that you didn't
tell anyone about it either.

38:48.470 --> 38:52.031
That goes for you too, young Master Neal.

38:52.033 --> 38:55.033
- My last name's Wells.
- Excuse me?

38:55.035 --> 38:57.308
His father's surname.

38:57.310 --> 39:00.968
Herbert George Wells.

39:00.970 --> 39:04.051
You're H.G. Wells.

39:04.053 --> 39:07.255
H.G.... I like that.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.073
Astonishing.

39:10.074 --> 39:13.354
God, it feels so good to
be in normal clothes again.

39:13.356 --> 39:16.611
The people here need to
invent fabric softener asap.

39:16.613 --> 39:18.548
Is that all?

39:18.550 --> 39:20.378
It's just that you've seemed a little off

39:20.380 --> 39:22.461
ever since you came
back from your walkabout.

39:22.463 --> 39:23.914
Ray, I told you...

39:23.916 --> 39:27.969
Something, but I don't
think it's the whole truth.

39:27.971 --> 39:31.780
I thought that we decided
to be honest with each other.

39:31.782 --> 39:33.872
And I am.

39:33.874 --> 39:36.507
I am being honest with you, Ray.

39:36.509 --> 39:41.366
Look, I met a woman, and
I learned some things.

39:41.368 --> 39:45.071
I told you about killing Savage.

39:45.073 --> 39:47.703
And the rest...

39:47.705 --> 39:52.564
the rest is what she
thought, not what I think.

39:52.566 --> 39:54.350
I don't have to listen to her.

40:03.753 --> 40:06.835
I love you.

40:06.837 --> 40:09.922
I love you too.

40:09.924 --> 40:11.609
I think they're waiting
for us on the bridge.

40:11.611 --> 40:12.972
We should go.

40:15.966 --> 40:17.893
So how are you feeling, given your concerns

40:17.895 --> 40:20.515
about becoming addicted
to this era once again?

40:20.517 --> 40:22.381
The last time I left, Martin,

40:22.383 --> 40:25.691
I did it to be with those closest to me.

40:25.693 --> 40:27.442
I'm doing the same again.

40:27.444 --> 40:29.200
So where to now?

40:29.202 --> 40:32.245
Or, more specifically, when?

40:32.247 --> 40:34.458
Is there another Fragmentation
we can hide out in?

40:34.460 --> 40:38.179
Unfortunately, matters
are not quite so simple.

40:38.181 --> 40:40.034
How'd I know you were gonna
say something like that?

40:40.036 --> 40:43.004
- Rip's buddies.
- And yours.

40:43.006 --> 40:46.520
The Time Masters have issued
Omega Protocols on all of us.

40:46.522 --> 40:48.952
That sounds pretty terrible.

40:48.954 --> 40:52.395
The worst kind of order they can issue...

40:52.397 --> 40:54.658
they've sent the Pilgrim after us.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.476
Who's the Pilgrim?

40:55.478 --> 40:58.261
The Pilgrim is the Time
Masters' most deadly assassin,

40:58.263 --> 41:01.375
and she will stop at nothing until
each and every one of you are dead.

41:01.377 --> 41:04.002
Ooh, scary.

41:04.004 --> 41:06.760
Pretty sure we can handle ourselves.

41:06.762 --> 41:09.287
Indeed...

41:09.289 --> 41:12.659
which is why she won't be going
after the present-day versions of you.

41:14.422 --> 41:17.303
She's hunting our younger selves.

41:17.305 --> 41:18.713
_

41:18.715 --> 41:21.677
And she won't stop until
each and every one of us

41:21.679 --> 41:24.170
has been erased from the timeline.
