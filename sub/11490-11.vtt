00:01.580 --> 00:04.490
Check it out. They got cars
that run on vegetable oil now.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.580
How about that.

00:05.590 --> 00:09.270
You know what would be cool? A
Hummer that runs on French fry grease.

00:10.250 --> 00:13.350
We could be energy independent
and still smash through crap.

00:13.370 --> 00:14.870
Sounds great.

00:14.890 --> 00:18.210
Plus, the new car smell is French fries.

00:18.220 --> 00:20.430
Okay, I'm only gonna
say this one more time.

00:20.450 --> 00:24.160
You don't get your license for two more
years and you're not getting a Hummer.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.730
You know, you say you want me to
open up to you, but what's the point?

00:32.860 --> 00:35.910
Yeah, I always loved
Paris in the springtime.

00:35.930 --> 00:36.900
Oh, you're lucky.

00:36.930 --> 00:39.800
I only got to do her once, on Halloween.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.020
Oh, hey, Alan.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.140
Andy, this is my
brother Alan. Alan, Andy.

00:46.150 --> 00:47.800
- Hello.
- Hey, Andy.

00:47.810 --> 00:49.890
Pull up a chair. We're
just telling war stories.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.610
Oh, great.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.880
- The sponge?
- Yeah.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.910
So, uh, how do you guys know each other?

00:58.640 --> 01:01.650
- Well, Andy and I--
- Can I have a cigar?

01:03.690 --> 01:06.140
- Sure, help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:07.140 --> 01:08.930
Anyway, Andy and I
have known each other--

01:08.940 --> 01:12.830
Maybe I'll take one for
now and one for later.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.490
Anyway, before he moved to New York,
Andy and I were partners in crime.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.230
There weren't that many actual crimes.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.380
Unless you count the
ones against nature.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.310
Alan, this is a great man.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.210
No, no, Albert Einstein was a great man.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.200
I just drink, gamble and hump.

01:34.210 --> 01:36.570
But I'm great at it.

01:36.580 --> 01:41.540
Andy once managed to hitchhike from
Vegas to L.A., wearing no pants.

01:41.550 --> 01:44.980
Hey, anybody can use their thumb.

01:45.960 --> 01:50.110
This right here, this is
the brother I never had.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.300
Oh, well, how nice for you.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.970
I don't mean it that way.

01:54.980 --> 01:57.050
- You're my brother.
- Well, thank you.

01:57.060 --> 02:00.260
I just like him better.

02:00.490 --> 02:01.510
Got it.

02:01.540 --> 02:05.830
Andy is the one guy in the world that can
match me drink for drink and broad for broad.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.630
In fact, the one time I thought
I drank him under the table,

02:07.650 --> 02:10.660
it turned out he had
a broad under there.

02:11.009 --> 02:13.820
Right, Andy?

02:14.680 --> 02:17.300
Andy?

02:17.770 --> 02:21.110
Don't screw with me, dude.

02:25.350 --> 02:27.540
Who's your favorite brother now?

02:28.920 --> 02:32.360

02:40.370 --> 02:42.660
So, he died right out
there in the chair, huh?

02:42.670 --> 02:44.810
Yep.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.720
Remind me to flip that cushion.

02:48.860 --> 02:49.820
You should've seen it, Berta.

02:49.830 --> 02:52.340
The paramedics zipped him
up in a big plastic bag.

02:52.360 --> 02:53.280
Is that so?

02:53.290 --> 02:57.040
It looked like one of those things the
delivery guys use to keep pizza hot.

02:57.890 --> 03:01.610
I wonder if they got him to the
morgue in 30 minutes or less.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.120
Not funny, Jake.

03:05.150 --> 03:08.250
Maybe it is funny and
you just didn't get it.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.420
Eat.

03:10.430 --> 03:12.140
So, uh, did you know him?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.170
Andy? Sure.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.190
Before he moved to New York, he
and Charlie were just like brothers.

03:17.210 --> 03:19.340
Yeah, I heard that part.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.470
How's Charlie taking it?

03:20.490 --> 03:21.700
He's pretty shook up.

03:21.710 --> 03:24.430
Well, you can understand why.

03:24.460 --> 03:30.770
Somebody your age, living the same dumbass
lifestyle you live keels over and dies.

03:30.780 --> 03:33.460
It's gotta give you pause.

03:33.480 --> 03:34.490
You're right about that.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.780
Actually, I'm surprised
that Charlie didn't go first.

03:36.790 --> 03:39.500
Excuse me.

03:40.190 --> 03:42.050
I'm standing right here.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.720
But for how long?

03:46.580 --> 03:49.590
Did you get that one?

03:49.600 --> 03:50.830
I'll see you later.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.850
Where you going?

03:51.860 --> 03:54.230
Where do you think? My
best friend just died.

03:54.240 --> 03:55.950
I got a lot of things to take care of.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.370
You're handling the funeral?

03:57.380 --> 03:58.740
I'm sure Andy would like that.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.340
The hell with Andy.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.310
I'm going to the hospital to get
every damn medical test known to man.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.450
Good one.

04:06.460 --> 04:09.360
You're not getting
any of these, are you?

04:14.390 --> 04:17.329
Hey, how'd the tests go?

04:17.350 --> 04:19.250
I won't know for a couple of days.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.170
All right, I'm outta here.

04:22.210 --> 04:24.620
How about you, Charlie?

04:28.540 --> 04:31.280
Wait, I got something for you.

04:31.290 --> 04:34.610
It's a gift certificate for a
week at a spa in Palm Springs.

04:34.630 --> 04:37.770
Well, I'll be. Thank you, Charlie.

04:37.780 --> 04:43.190
I just wand you to know that I love you and
appreciate that you've always been there for me.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.140
Great, see you in a week.

04:49.450 --> 04:50.430
Look at you.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.190
The minute you start
thinking about your mortality,

04:52.210 --> 04:55.030
you realize how much you care
about the people around you.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.350
Yeah, and I need to start showing it.

04:57.380 --> 05:03.100
Well, little gifts are always a
nice way to express your feelings.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.680
I know.

05:04.700 --> 05:10.840
Could be as simple as a cashmere
robe or as extravagant as a new car.

05:12.470 --> 05:15.300
Yeah, I suppose it could.

05:15.310 --> 05:18.880
Excuse me, I got something
really cool for Jake.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.390
Doesn't even have to be new!

05:22.400 --> 05:25.750
Certified pre-owned is
still very thoughtful!

05:29.580 --> 05:31.310
Hey, what are you doing?

05:31.320 --> 05:35.710
I was trying to research cars, but you wouldn't
believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."

05:38.910 --> 05:41.830
Actually, I would.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.860
Here, I got you something I
think you're really gonna like.

05:45.890 --> 05:47.850
wich?

05:47.860 --> 05:49.740
*****

05:49.750 --> 05:51.900
'Cause you want me to be surprised?

05:51.930 --> 05:54.060
Just open it.

05:54.070 --> 05:57.100
You know what's a great
sandwich? The Monte Cristo.

05:57.110 --> 06:00.990
'Cause it has ham and
cheese and it's fried.

06:01.010 --> 06:02.550
Open the damn box.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.480
Whoa, don't get your period.

06:07.740 --> 06:09.550
Oh, wow, a mini video camera.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.450
Pretty cool, huh?

06:10.460 --> 06:12.670
Is this 'cause you think you're dying?

06:12.680 --> 06:16.050
No, no. I just wanted to
do something nice for you.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.970
Before you die.

06:17.980 --> 06:19.270
Do you want the camera or not?

06:19.290 --> 06:20.410
Yeah, I want it.

06:20.430 --> 06:21.790
Then just say thank you.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.240
Thank you. Geez.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.410
You need to relax. You'll
give yourself a heart attack.

06:27.170 --> 06:28.650
I'll work on it.

06:28.660 --> 06:31.870
Have a sandwich. That always relaxes me.

06:34.180 --> 06:37.540
All right, one more gift to give.

06:37.550 --> 06:41.620
Oh, yeah? Saving the best for last?

06:42.480 --> 06:46.280
I don't know about the best,
but it's sure the hardest.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.380
Any way I can make it easier?

06:48.390 --> 06:50.090
Yeah.

06:50.100 --> 06:53.210
Call Mom and tell her
I'm on my way over.

06:59.130 --> 07:03.830
Oh, Charlie, what a beautiful watch!

07:03.840 --> 07:04.880
Do you really like it?

07:04.900 --> 07:08.160
Are you kidding? It's gorgeous!

07:08.170 --> 07:12.360
And the best part is now I don't
have to wear my good one every day.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.170
Anyway, you're probably
wondering why I bought it for you.

07:18.180 --> 07:23.270
Well, I just assumed you love me and
did it out of the goodness of your heart.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.600
I'm kidding. Why, dear?

07:26.610 --> 07:29.160
Okay, I deserve that.

07:29.180 --> 07:35.020
But the truth is I do love you and despite our
many differences, I'm glad you're my mother.

07:35.420 --> 07:39.270
You didn't drive over
here drunk, did you?

07:39.970 --> 07:42.960
I'm not drunk. I just...

07:43.440 --> 07:46.720
I've been thinking a lot
about how fleeting life is,

07:46.750 --> 07:50.050
and that none of us really knows
how long we're gonna be here.

07:50.080 --> 07:53.420
Did you find another
lump on your pee-pee?

07:55.470 --> 07:58.390
No, Mom, my pee-pee's fine.

07:58.410 --> 08:02.660
I don't know how "worn down to a
nub" can be fine, but all right.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.590
My point is, I don't want
to be angry with you anymore.

08:07.610 --> 08:09.450
I want us to be friends.

08:09.470 --> 08:13.200
I was always your friend, Charlie.

08:13.210 --> 08:16.790
You were just too
self-involved to see it.

08:19.460 --> 08:22.010
Okay, I got to go.

08:22.050 --> 08:23.530
Where you off to?

08:23.550 --> 08:26.390
I have to pick out a
casket for a friend of mine.

08:26.410 --> 08:28.360
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

08:28.370 --> 08:31.090
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.760
Don't cheap out.

08:32.780 --> 08:37.159
It's one thing to do it with a
watch, but a casket is forever.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.910
So young. I can't believe it.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.500
Yeah...

08:48.510 --> 08:52.220
Who'd have thought smoking,
drinking and whoring could kill you?

08:53.250 --> 08:56.190
You realize that could just
as easily be me in there.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.620
Yeah.

08:58.640 --> 09:01.520
Don't even think that.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.060
It is a nice casket, though.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.410
Should be. It cost me ten grand.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.230
Ten grand? Wow.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.530
What can I say? I take
care of the people I love.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.890
Could've taken care of
me with a freakin' robe.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.350
Kind of a light turnout.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.050
You'd probably get more
people with an open bar.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.520
Hey, make sure there's
an open bar at mine.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.380
Oh, now I'm your funeral planner?

09:26.390 --> 09:30.160
Don't you want a friend or someone you
really care about in charge of that?

09:30.170 --> 09:33.250
No, you do it.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.270
Good afternoon and welcome.

09:36.290 --> 09:40.990
We are here to celebrate the
life and mourn the passing

09:41.000 --> 09:44.680
of Andrew Donald Patterson.

09:44.690 --> 09:48.280
How do we measure a man's life?

09:48.290 --> 09:51.540
Geez, this guy's a load.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.150
Don't get a guy like this for me.

09:56.180 --> 09:59.530
I want someone with a
little bit of gravitas.

09:59.540 --> 10:02.160
I'll see if James Earl
Jones is available.

10:02.170 --> 10:03.470
That would be nice.

10:03.480 --> 10:08.870
"...a time to die,a time to reap,"

10:08.880 --> 10:13.590
"a time to sow,a time to mourn..."

10:13.600 --> 10:15.150
"...a time to heal."

10:15.170 --> 10:17.540
"a time for every purpose under heaven."

10:17.550 --> 10:21.530
And so we say goodbye to
Charles Francis Harper.

10:21.540 --> 10:25.590
Devoted son, loving
brother, caring uncle.

10:25.600 --> 10:30.310
Bon vivant and world-class
connoisseur of the booty.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.640
Nice turnout.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.620
Yeah, man. Standing room only.

10:37.630 --> 10:41.130
Goes to show you, give
the people what they want.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.510
You mean the open barright?

10:43.520 --> 10:45.900
Sure.

10:48.150 --> 10:49.750
Thanks for coming, by the way.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.270
Well, you came to mine.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.430
Yeah, but you're dead.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.720
Charlie, take a look in the box.

10:55.730 --> 10:58.470
That's not a tanning booth.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.850
Oh, yeah.

11:00.870 --> 11:04.260
So, listen, as long as you're
here-- what's Heaven like?

11:04.290 --> 11:06.880
It's unbelievable. It's paradise.

11:06.890 --> 11:10.080
Like your house. Before
your brother moved in.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.650
Oh, that was good.

11:11.690 --> 11:13.950
You can drink all you want
and there's no hangover.

11:13.970 --> 11:18.070
Endless supply of women, each one more
beautiful than the last, and, Charlie, get this:

11:18.100 --> 11:21.030
they believe everything you tell 'em.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.240
Everything?

11:22.260 --> 11:24.530
It's Heaven, dude.

11:26.930 --> 11:28.430
Well, save me a good seat.

11:28.460 --> 11:32.210
I wish I could, but that's
not where they sent me.

11:33.790 --> 11:36.480
Then how do you know what Heaven's like?

11:36.490 --> 11:42.400
They make us look at a video every day,
while they're putting lube on the pitchfork.

11:44.090 --> 11:46.690
Well, at least you get lube.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.930
Only on the little prong.

11:50.430 --> 11:54.350
To be completely honest, I
didn't know Charlie Harper,

11:54.390 --> 12:00.580
but any man who, with his dying
breath, would set aside $25,000

12:00.590 --> 12:04.450
and a first-class air ticket,
so I could deliver his eulogy...

12:04.470 --> 12:07.690
is aces in my book!

12:08.150 --> 12:09.930
That being said, uh...

12:09.960 --> 12:11.980
there are many people here
today who did know Charlie,

12:11.990 --> 12:15.550
and perhaps some of them would like
to stand up and say a few words.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.960
I want to say something.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.490
Hello, everybody.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.500
Hello, James Earl Jones.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.360
hey, bro. Don't get up.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.540
What can I say about Charlie?

12:32.560 --> 12:37.880
Uh, so many words come to mind--
so few that you can say in church.

12:38.540 --> 12:41.530
But we'll give it a shot.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.850
Charlie was a man of love.

12:44.870 --> 12:48.620
Um, he loved his friends;
he loved his family;

12:48.630 --> 12:52.320
but, most of all, he loved his penis...

12:53.260 --> 12:57.260
the only part of him that
ever had an actual job.

12:58.370 --> 13:00.520
Well, anyway...

13:00.530 --> 13:05.720
this was a man so full of love that
it practically oozed out of him,

13:05.750 --> 13:09.490
at which point, of course,
he would see a doctor.

13:13.920 --> 13:17.910
But I kid the deceased whoremonger.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.700
Anyway...since he never made out a will,

13:21.710 --> 13:27.930
I hope you will all join me for a
wake-slash-luau at my Malibu beach house!

13:32.960 --> 13:34.430
He got my house?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.790
He got everything you had.

13:35.800 --> 13:36.810
Everything?

13:36.820 --> 13:40.950
Well, not the diseased liver
and the swollen prostate.

13:41.870 --> 13:47.000
Oh, look, your old girlfriends
are saying their final goodbye.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.800
That's not very respectful.

13:54.830 --> 13:59.410
Just FYI-- spit is
the Devil's lube.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.510
Listen, would you mind recording
my answering machine message for me?

14:05.530 --> 14:07.820
That'll be an extra $500.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
That's okay. I'm rich now.

14:09.850 --> 14:13.700
Well, what do you want: "This is
CNN" or "Luke, I am your father"?

14:14.100 --> 14:17.460
So, Charlie, it's been great
catching up but I gotta go.

14:17.470 --> 14:20.440
Already? Can't you stay awhile?

14:20.450 --> 14:22.710
No. It's pitchfork time.

14:22.720 --> 14:26.170
If you're late, you don't get the spit.

14:26.180 --> 14:30.090
And, believe me, Charlie,
you want the spit.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.980
I want the spit!

14:34.000 --> 14:40.074

14:44.510 --> 14:48.290
Harper. Charlie Harper.
It was in a few days ago.

14:49.470 --> 14:54.620
I peed in a cup; you took my blood and
slipped a camera up the heart of darkness.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.720
You know, the doctor said my
results would beeady today.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.590
Fine. Have him get back to me.

15:03.880 --> 15:05.910
He's avoiding my calls, Alan.

15:05.930 --> 15:07.000
I'm gonna die.

15:07.030 --> 15:09.030
No. No you're not.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.140
I can feel it.

15:11.170 --> 15:14.780
You might as well just drive
into that tree and kill us both.

15:14.790 --> 15:19.080
Sure. I don't want to
go on living without you.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.370
What's the point of it all?

15:22.380 --> 15:26.840
Yeah, I'm rich, charming,
classically handsome.

15:26.850 --> 15:31.950
I've laid more pipe than a
guy who has sex with pipes.

15:32.810 --> 15:36.120
But what have I done with my life?

15:36.130 --> 15:41.150
A few stupid jingles; some kids'
songs-- nothing that really matters.

15:41.160 --> 15:45.020
Now, now, you're being
too hard on yourself.

15:45.030 --> 15:48.160
I've got no wife,
I've got no children...

15:48.180 --> 15:50.520
I'm going leave this
world the way I came in...

15:50.560 --> 15:53.640
By Cesarean section?

15:53.930 --> 15:56.150
Alone.

15:56.160 --> 16:00.010
Oh, for God sakes, Charlie, I
am tired of listening to this.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.940
There has always been one person in your life who's
been there for you and loved you unconditionally.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.180
You mean...

16:12.990 --> 16:14.570
You're right.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.590
How could I have missed it?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.230
It's been in front of me the whole time!

16:18.250 --> 16:20.570
Well, you know, sometimes you
can't see the forest for the trees,

16:20.600 --> 16:23.470
even when the forest
is in your own backyard.

16:23.510 --> 16:26.110
Or guest room.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.500
Rose?

16:30.070 --> 16:32.400
Yep, the one and only.

16:32.410 --> 16:35.520
I know, I know. It's been awhile.

16:36.180 --> 16:41.240
I was thinking, if you're not too busy, maybe
we can get together, have a drink or something?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.960
Well, great!

16:42.990 --> 16:46.130
So, do you want to meet,
or should I pick you up?

16:53.720 --> 16:57.100
Okay, I'll meet you back at my place.

16:59.970 --> 17:01.820
Small world.

17:01.830 --> 17:05.380
Yeah. Teeny-tiny.

17:09.849 --> 17:13.040
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Charlie.

17:13.050 --> 17:15.440
- You comfy?
- Oh, very.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.210
Good.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.880
So, Rose...

17:22.900 --> 17:24.930
Charlie...

17:24.940 --> 17:26.430
Haven't seen you in awhile.

17:26.460 --> 17:29.110
Can't say the same.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.780
Right, uh, sure.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.870
Sorry about your friend.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.950
Yeah, yeah, it was a
real wake-up call for me.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.370
I can imagine.

17:41.390 --> 17:44.700
Makes you stop and wonder
what's important in your life.

17:44.710 --> 17:47.320
Who's important in your life.

17:47.350 --> 17:50.290
I've always known who's
important in my life.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.330
You have, haven't you.

17:53.930 --> 17:57.230
You know how I feel about you, right?

17:57.250 --> 18:00.350
Tell me anyway.

18:00.360 --> 18:02.410
Oh, okay.

18:02.420 --> 18:05.990
Well, as you know, we've
had our ups and downs.

18:06.010 --> 18:09.390
I told you that was my medication.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.440
I was talking about our relationship.

18:12.870 --> 18:17.180
Yes. That's had ups and
downs, too. Continue.

18:17.650 --> 18:21.270
Well, uh, I'm thinking,
we're not getting any younger.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.950
You know, there was a time when
I did think I was getting younger

18:23.970 --> 18:27.180
but it turns out that
that was my medication.

18:27.630 --> 18:28.560
Sure.

18:28.570 --> 18:31.690
I also thought that
I was getting smaller.

18:35.540 --> 18:39.560
Anyway, uh, it struck me that life is...

18:39.580 --> 18:45.020
short, and maybe the time has come for you
and I to start thinking about our future.

18:45.540 --> 18:48.260
What about it?

18:48.540 --> 18:50.590
Well...

18:50.610 --> 18:54.090
I know this is kind of sudden, but...

19:01.150 --> 19:02.640
Rose...

19:02.650 --> 19:04.370
Yes, Charlie?

19:04.380 --> 19:07.190
Would you do me the honor of...

19:10.040 --> 19:13.330
I'm sorry. Let me just get rid of this.

19:13.340 --> 19:16.480
Oh, it's my doctor.

19:17.550 --> 19:20.470
Hey, Doc. What's the word?

19:21.060 --> 19:24.130
No liver damage whatsoever?

19:26.360 --> 19:29.080
What about my heart?

19:29.100 --> 19:31.200
Well, that's terrific!

19:31.210 --> 19:33.920
Lungs are good, too?

19:33.930 --> 19:36.780
So I don't have to give up cigars?

19:36.790 --> 19:38.670
No, no, no, I won't overdo it.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.740
Just when I drink.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.660
Speaking of which--
how's the plumbing?

19:45.670 --> 19:47.950
Does that include the prostate?

19:47.970 --> 19:50.490
Yes.

19:51.930 --> 19:55.500
All right, well, uh, thanks
for getting back to me so soon.

19:55.550 --> 20:01.270
And, again, I'm sorry for all the name
calling when you slipped your finger up there.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.700
Oh, boy, this is awkward.

20:21.370 --> 20:24.950
Look at him-- he's
gonna live forever.

20:24.970 --> 20:29.340
Nah, it's just gonna seem like forever.

20:30.490 --> 20:34.790
He smokes, he drinks, he
parties like there's no tomorrow.

20:34.820 --> 20:35.780
Me?

20:35.790 --> 20:39.470
I have Mexican food and a couple
of beers and I'm farting blood.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.360
Yeah, boo-hoo.

20:44.370 --> 20:48.120
You just said Mexican food
and I grew a third butt cheek.

20:48.950 --> 20:50.710
Life isn't fair, is it, Berta?

20:50.720 --> 20:55.110
If it were, you'd be cleaning my
toilets and I'd have my own talk show.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.150
A talk show?!

20:57.170 --> 20:59.640
Why not? I'm personable.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.510
Well, at least he has a clean
bill of health. I'm happy for that.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.780
Me, too.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.600
I don't care if I never
inherit this house.

21:08.610 --> 21:10.650
Uh, uh... excuse me?

21:10.660 --> 21:13.050
Oh, you ain't seen his new will, huh?

21:13.080 --> 21:14.420
Uh, what new will?

21:14.430 --> 21:16.930
Never mind.

21:17.350 --> 21:18.990
But in case tragedy strikes,

21:19.010 --> 21:22.560
be prepared to clear your
crap out of here in 48 hours.

21:25.650 --> 21:28.060
Son of a bitch.
