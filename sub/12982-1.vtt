I've just done this great little film.
It's called <i>Five Boroughs.</i>

29:13.169 --> 29:14.879
- It's low-budget. First-time director.
- Yeah.

29:14.962 --> 29:16.839
But it's really moving.

29:17.673 --> 29:20.635
Hey, you know,
maybe you could do a little...

29:21.260 --> 29:22.303
Vincent.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.597
- Good to see you.
- Lawrence, right?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.599
- Yeah.
- How are you, sir?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.934
- Good.
- Good to see you, too.

29:28.017 --> 29:30.186
- How's the picture?
- Pretty close to perfect,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.897
if I can just get all the experts
to leave me alone.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.690
In fact, I'm going to have
some screenings next week.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.525
- You should come by.
- Hey,

29:37.109 --> 29:40.446
that was Rachel Petkoff.
She's a fantastic actress.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.949
She's not been in anything for a while,
but she was, in her day...

29:43.032 --> 29:44.700
- Sure.
- No, seriously.

29:44.784 --> 29:45.785
I think she's due for a comeback.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.828
We should get in there.
Do a profile before anyone else...

29:47.912 --> 29:52.750
Sidney, I'd like to introduce you
to Vincent Lepak, enfant terrible.

29:53.250 --> 29:57.421
In my opinion, the most exciting
new director in American cinema.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.757

I've been to in my whole life.

VINCENT: Yeah.

30:10.518 --> 30:11.894
Excuse me.

30:12.895 --> 30:15.982
Could I have your autograph, please?
I'm a huge fan.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.944
- Is that so?
- Yeah, I've seen everything

30:20.027 --> 30:21.487
you've been in.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.155

30:23.239 --> 30:26.158
and <i>The Bionic Woman</i> and <i>Song Birds.</i>

30:26.659 --> 30:30.621

your first ever TV appearance,

30:30.705 --> 30:32.665
<i>The Twilight Zone,</i> "House of Mirrors."

30:32.748 --> 30:34.041
(BOTH LAUGH)

30:34.125 --> 30:35.251
Right!

30:35.334 --> 30:38.671
But my all-time favourite
has to be <i>A Day Too Long.</i>

30:38.754 --> 30:40.381
You were great in that.

30:46.387 --> 30:49.765
- What's your name, honey?
- It's Sidney. Sidney Young.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.482
- Thanks.
- I'll remember that.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.403
Thank you.

I mean, you look around you
and it's all shit, you know.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.828
No one's making movies
that are fucking worthwhile.

31:10.911 --> 31:13.164
I have to disagree with you, Vincent.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.875
You're making movies
that are worthwhile.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.961
This is what I'm saying, you know.
You have to inspire yourself.

- Excuse me?

31:24.884 --> 31:27.720
What is the greatest film ever made?
Have a guess.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.974
Well, I don't know.
I don't think there is one...

31:32.058 --> 31:33.517
- Have a guess.
- Yeah. No. Have a guess.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.439

Yeah. Hon Sidney Young.

42:10.237 --> 42:14.950
Hon. H-O-N. It's short for "Honourable."
Yeah, it's a British title.

42:16.118 --> 42:18.745
The Queen? Yeah, I know the Queen.

42:18.829 --> 42:21.248
She used to be
in my break-dancing posse.

42:21.415 --> 42:23.041
She's a body-popper
more than anything.

42:35.721 --> 42:38.014
So, how's it feel to be a star?

42:38.098 --> 42:41.893
No, don't, it's so embarrassing. God.
Those pictures are everywhere now,

42:41.977 --> 42:44.771
and I had no idea that, that dress
was so see-through.

42:44.855 --> 42:47.482
Plus, everybody's talking about it
like it was some kind of stunt.

42:47.566 --> 42:49.317
Such a cynical age. Hmm?

42:49.818 --> 42:51.486
Hello, Sidney.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.494
Hi, I was just looking for my, you know...

42:59.786 --> 43:01.037
I didn't know you were coming in today.

43:01.121 --> 43:03.123
Lawrence is taking us to lunch
at Cipriani.

43:03.206 --> 43:04.833
(SCREAMS) That's nice.

43:05.500 --> 43:08.420
Lawrence, can I leave Cuba here?
He doesn't like Italian food.

43:08.503 --> 43:11.047
Of course you can.
He can stay in my office.

43:11.381 --> 43:14.760
Sidney, fetch Cuba a bowl of water.

43:14.843 --> 43:16.887
- Will you?
- Of course.

43:24.019 --> 43:26.062
That is a lovely ring.

43:26.688 --> 43:30.525
- Where is that from?
- It was my mother's. She gave it to me.

43:31.193 --> 43:34.738
You sweetie. That is very, very...

43:36.364 --> 43:37.657
So, listen.

43:39.117 --> 43:41.787
You've met Vincent Lepak,
haven't you, Sidney?

43:41.870 --> 43:43.497
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.458
See, he has a new movie
coming out soon,

43:46.541 --> 43:50.212
and Lawrence is overstretched as it is.

43:51.588 --> 43:54.090
How would you like
to do the feature on him?

43:56.551 --> 43:59.137
Yeah, I would, actually.
Yes, I'd like that very much.

43:59.221 --> 44:00.722
Well, great.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.976
Maybe we can get together
and discuss the angle.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.144
Okay.

44:07.896 --> 44:09.648
What do you mean, "angle"?

44:10.732 --> 44:13.318
Well, I'd need to know
how we're going to present Vincent.

44:13.401 --> 44:15.570
You know, check the story and so on.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.074
Are you saying you want copy approval?

44:19.741 --> 44:22.077
Any stories written about my clients

44:22.160 --> 44:24.871
need to be in their best interest,
that's all.

44:25.497 --> 44:28.250
I mean, if things work out with Vincent,

44:28.625 --> 44:31.670
maybe we can talk about
a follow-up story on Sophie.

44:33.129 --> 44:34.798
What do you think?

44:37.592 --> 44:40.095
I'm sorry, Eleanor, I don't work that way.

44:42.097 --> 44:44.432
Sidney, dear...

44:45.141 --> 44:48.728
Think of it like this.
You write about one of my clients,

44:49.521 --> 44:51.982
you are borrowing
some of their starlight

44:52.107 --> 44:54.109

It's Uncle Sidney.
Come to see how you are. Yes.

There you go. That's it. That's it.

45:45.660 --> 45:48.330
Well done. Well done.

45:48.872 --> 45:50.957
You and me are going to be pals,
aren't we?

45:51.041 --> 45:53.335
Yes, we're going to be pals, yes.

45:53.418 --> 45:55.003
You're going to like me
much, much better

45:55.086 --> 45:57.923
than that prick Maddox, aren't you?
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

45:58.006 --> 46:00.175

I'll bring it right back.
I was just going to put...

- Give me my bag.
- Just let me borrow it.

I was trying to make friends,
and then it was...

Okay, just please don't tell her.

- What?

No, not yet.

They're kissing my ass.

watching the fucker burn.

What do you want?

48:42.003 --> 48:44.672
I want to write a story
about Vincent Lepak, okay?

Not a puff piece.
Something funny, with teeth.

and he's not. He's an idiot.

Do it. He's an annoying little prick.

she's upset because she lost her dog.

Flowers? Yeah, 'cause she doesn't
get enough flowers, does she?

Yes, but they were dead.

- All of them?
- Yeah. It was kind of shocking, actually.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.669
Were they dead when you sent them?
