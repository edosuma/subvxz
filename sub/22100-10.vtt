(DRAMATIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

00:22.564 --> 00:24.565
TIGH: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.777
TYROL: I just finished the
post-flight on Starbuck's Viper.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.488
This thing looks like it's been
rolled off the showroom floor.

00:31.115 --> 00:32.949
ROSLIN: It's time to get some answers.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.117
Plug it in.

00:34.702 --> 00:35.785
Jump!

00:37.538 --> 00:40.832
ZAREK: President Roslin was
apparently aboard the Cylon Baseship,

00:40.916 --> 00:43.876
along with Gaius Baltar
and many of Galactica's pilots

00:43.961 --> 00:45.169
when it jumped away.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.089
APOLLO: Waiting alone in a Raptor,
while the rest of the Fleet jumps away,

00:48.173 --> 00:50.049
that sounds
a lot like suicide, Dad.

00:50.134 --> 00:51.217
Why are you doing this?

00:51.468 --> 00:53.136
ADAMA: Because I can't live without her.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.305
HELO ON RADIO: We have D'Anna on
board. We are clear of the hub.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.057
Commence nuclear strike.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.813
So you know about
the Final Five.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.275
I know they're supposed
to know the way to Earth.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.610
I gotta worry about
protecting myself.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.864
I'll tell you when you
take me back to your fleet.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.286
(WHOOSHING)

01:21.874 --> 01:23.499
I love you.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.045
About time.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.480
Hey, there, Mr. Prez.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.315
Heard you were here.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.362
Temple of Aurora.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.365
On Earth.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.204
At least the way
Pythia described it.

02:01.538 --> 02:05.374
We'll get there.
Walk those halls together.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.378
Yeah, pretty to think so.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.674
This Roslin's stuff?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.426
(SIGHS)

02:15.511 --> 02:17.261
It's weird for them
to not be here.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.680
No one sits in his chair.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.684
Tigh can't even look at it.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.230
You know, the scariest thing my mom
used to tell me when I was a kid,

02:28.065 --> 02:30.650
"Your father is waiting
for you in the study. "

02:30.734 --> 02:32.610
I'd knock on the door,

02:33.904 --> 02:37.323
make the long walk
across the room

02:40.244 --> 02:42.245
to that desk.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.165
You know, Leoben said
something to me

02:46.250 --> 02:49.877
when he was holding me in
that doll house on New Caprica.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.882
That children are born
to replace their parents.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.972
For children to reach their full
potential, their parents have to die.

03:10.566 --> 03:13.192
You'll rejoin your fleet
in less than an hour.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.736
Then we will return
your Final Five to you.

03:15.821 --> 03:16.904
Four.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.740
There are four
in your fleet.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.701
Four. Where's the fifth?

03:21.785 --> 03:24.036
I want the four
in your fleet.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.455
It would be easier if you
just tell us who they are.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.374
Easier because
you could kill them.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.293
Why would we do that?

03:30.794 --> 03:33.045
They know the way to
Earth. We need them.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.714
She's right. We all
want the same thing.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.965
If we cooperate...

03:36.049 --> 03:38.634
We cooperated on
New Caprica, Brother.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.761
It didn't work out well.

03:41.638 --> 03:46.601
I'm going to hold your people hostage until
the Final Four are safely aboard this ship.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.197
You need to
stand down, Bill.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.534
Come on. Trust me.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.418
Stand down.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.174
Pass the word around.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.675
Stack arms.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.261
I've already had
an Eight prepare a Raptor,

04:22.346 --> 04:24.847
so we'll launch as soon
as we come out of the jump.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.893
And, Admiral, you'll be coming
along with me to Galactica.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.103
I'm not going.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.521
Bill, go.

04:36.151 --> 04:40.613
(WHISPERING) If the Cylons get the four,
they get Earth. You can't let this happen.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.699
Even if you have to
blow this ship to hell.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.554
Gods damn it.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.936
I got it, Felix.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.942
Yeah. Thanks.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.077
Mr. Gaeta, do you
wish to be relieved?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.704
Good to go.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.460
(PANEL BEEPING)

05:36.545 --> 05:37.670

05:37.754 --> 05:41.173
Incoming, bearing 1-8-5,
carom 2-niner-niner at 1700.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.092
What do we got?
Cylon Baseship.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.594
Another contact,
same bearing.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.013
It's a Raptor.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.306
Our people are back, sir.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.292
Maybe she won't be
able to identify us.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.299
Gods, it's good
to have you back.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.260
It's good to be home.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.908
The good news is
that your president,

06:48.992 --> 06:51.827
Laura Roslin, is alive and
well, as are your crewmates.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.997
She wants the four Cylons
that are in this fleet.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.417
She's gonna hold our people
hostage until she gets them.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.337
You don't have to do anything
except stay out of the way.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.089
I'm already in
contact with them.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.507
Now that they realize
there's nothing to fear

07:04.591 --> 07:07.134
and that we only want
to love and protect them,

07:07.219 --> 07:09.804
they should find
a way of joining us.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.182
I just ask that you don't interfere with
any of the shuttle traffic in the fleet.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.434
So your plan is you
take these four Cylons,

07:15.519 --> 07:18.270
and then you head off to
Earth, leaving us behind.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.564
Now that's up to them.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.566
All right.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.987
If these four Cylons want to come
to you, they're free to do so.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.989
I will not stop them.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.326
Do you agree
with this, Admiral?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.494
Agreed.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.872
Well, then I will await
them on the Baseship.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.379
Laura Roslin needs
her medication.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.967
And I need to make sure
that she's all right.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.009
I'm gonna go with them.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.261
No.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.097
We can't give them
any more hostages.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.890
APOLLO: The Colonel's right.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.561
I served under Roslin
for two years.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.147
My place is by her side.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.316
Another hostage isn't
gonna change the equation.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.820
All right, go.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.405
Thank you.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.791
I backed your play,
and now what?

08:20.917 --> 08:24.420
Starbuck goes to work on a plan
to get our people back by force.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.174
If we can't stop the Cylons
from reaching the Baseship,

08:28.258 --> 08:30.843
Laura Roslin wants
it destroyed.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.262
Half our guys
are over there.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.600
It's your call,
Mr. President.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.107
Roslin's right.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.696
We lose those four,
we lose Earth.

08:50.780 --> 08:55.117
If everything goes south, we destroy
the Baseship and everyone on it.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.795
(THEME MUSIC)

09:48.255 --> 09:49.588
So the prisoners were here,

09:49.673 --> 09:51.590
but D'Anna has to know that
you brought me in on this.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.758
If she's moved
the prisoners,

09:52.842 --> 09:55.552
it'll mean a compartment
by compartment fight.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.472
And if they open fire on the
civilian fleet while we're boarding?

09:58.556 --> 10:01.684
They could wipe out the human
race right there and then.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.810
That's why we need
to make sure that

10:02.894 --> 10:05.271
our Raptors are already out there
with their nukes cocked and locked.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.981
There's gotta be
other options.

10:07.065 --> 10:09.900
Yeah, those frakking four
could give themselves up.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.291
Brothers and Sisters,
this is a great day for us.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.002
One of our lost
siblings has arrived.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.550
She's one of
the Final Five?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.552
I saw her
in my vision.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.471
Now she's
come home.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.439
Laura.

10:48.898 --> 10:52.318
There's been something I've
been meaning to say to you.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.405
I wanted to thank you.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.614
For what?

10:58.700 --> 11:01.243
Essentially for
not murdering me.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.335
That can't have been
an easy decision to make.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.923
But I love living.

11:15.884 --> 11:20.554
I love living, and I wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

11:36.821 --> 11:40.574
I wouldn't be so
grateful if I were you.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.827
You should know that I told the Admiral
that if D'Anna doesn't back down,

11:43.953 --> 11:46.205
he should blow
the ship to pieces.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.624
You what? NO. 6: She's in here.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.129
Madam President.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.298
Gaius.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.425
Tory.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.135
Sit down.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.475
I brought you
your medication.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.894
Oh, my Gods.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.729
How did you do that?

12:10.814 --> 12:13.357
I came back with D'Anna

12:14.442 --> 12:16.527
to be with my people.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.947
Because you're
one of the Five.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.700
You're one of
the Final Five.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.494
D'Anna saw her.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.247
In a vision.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.584
I knew it.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.753
Maybe not on
a conscious level,

12:34.838 --> 12:38.507
but subconsciously, I always
knew there was something.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.593
You had no idea.
Did you?

12:41.678 --> 12:42.719
No.

12:46.391 --> 12:50.144
Might be worth pondering what
else you've been wrong about.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.731
Tory, wait.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.281
You're right.
I'm wrong.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.033
Okay.

13:06.035 --> 13:11.957
You are one of the revered Final Five,
and as such, the Cylons will listen to you.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.959
Is that not right?

13:15.378 --> 13:18.922
So, Tory, please go to D'Anna

13:19.007 --> 13:23.552
and try to convince her to back
down and release all the hostages.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.221
I'm done taking
orders from you.

13:43.907 --> 13:47.034
D'ANNA ON RADIO: Mr. President,
there has been a change of plans.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.829
I've just executed the first
of the Colonial hostages.

13:51.664 --> 13:55.834
Another will follow every quarter
hour until our people come home.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.378
All right, listen to me.

You're not giving this a
chance. We are cooperating.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.928
She terminated
the transmission.

14:13.561 --> 14:17.272
All right then, Admiral, you're
a go for the rescue mission.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.400
If it fails,

14:21.402 --> 14:23.654
destroy the Baseship.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.907
Yes, Mr. President.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.420
All right, put these
pilots in their cockpits.

put these birds in the tubes.

It is our job to
get them back alive.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.492
So speed is the only thing
we have on our side.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.536
They're no doubt expecting us
to try for a breakout,

15:12.620 --> 15:15.372
so we have to get in under their
reaction time, which is damn fast.

we're doing here?

Something about
this Viper.

You checked every rivet and washer on
that bird, and you didn't find squat.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.180
Yeah, well, something
brought us here.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.599
Something's changed.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.644
I just don't know
what it is.

Maybe Kara can help.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.986
She flew this thing
to Earth and back.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.990

can tell you. But hurry up.

are gonna die.

I'm looking for options. You got one?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.132
Yeah.

17:30.925 --> 17:35.303
I should've told you when I first
found out, but I didn't have the guts.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.310
What's wrong with you, Saul?

17:45.314 --> 17:50.402
You remember back at the nebula when
I told you about that frakking music?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.446
I thought it was in the ship.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.406
I was wrong.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.491
It was a signal.

17:56.576 --> 18:01.496
Some kind of crazy, frakked-up
Cylon signal switched me on.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.670
I can't turn it off.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.843
Switched you on.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.888
Like Boomer.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.058
I'm one of the Five.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.104
The Five.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.565
One of the Cylons
D'Anna's after.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.737
Quit frakking with me.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.239
Colonel, I've known you for 30 years.

18:36.324 --> 18:37.908
I told you.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.535
I didn't find out
until the nebula.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.999
Think about this.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.419
When I met you,
you had hair.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.132
I never heard of
a Cylon aging.

18:54.217 --> 18:55.509
Doesn't mean they don't.

18:55.593 --> 18:59.679
Before the attack on the Colonies,
we didn't know skin jobs existed.

18:59.764 --> 19:03.141
Turns out there's another kind
of Cylon we didn't know about,

19:03.226 --> 19:05.060
and I'm one of them.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.903
On New Caprica,
you were in captivity.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.823
They did something
to you, they...

19:17.907 --> 19:22.744
An implant, a post-hypnotic suggestion
that makes you feel this way.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.039
Let's go talk to Doc Cottle...

19:26.123 --> 19:27.833
Listen to me!

19:27.917 --> 19:33.213
It is not a delusion. It is not
a chip in my head. I am a Cylon.

19:34.257 --> 19:38.051
I've fooled you for months now.
I didn't want to, but I did.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.553
Get your hands off of me.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.639
If I'd had the guts to airlock
myself when I first found out,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.432
we wouldn't be in this mess.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.518
But that's the way out.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.603
Not this suicidal attack.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.817
I am one of the Final Five.

19:55.403 --> 19:59.656
D'Anna will back down if you
threaten to flush me out an airlock.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.429
(SCREAMING)

20:54.962 --> 20:56.087
Okay.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.090

21:03.512 --> 21:05.013

21:10.144 --> 21:13.355
Dad, Dad.
Dad, listen.

21:14.315 --> 21:17.275
No one suspected.
No one.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.071
Not with his record, what
he did on New Caprica.

21:21.155 --> 21:27.953
His eye, what happened to his
wife... Come on, let's get up.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.624
What have I done?

21:32.708 --> 21:36.628
All the people
I've sent to die.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.215
For what?

21:41.384 --> 21:43.176
For what?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.344
For Earth.

21:45.096 --> 21:49.182
There is no Earth.
It's a frakking joke.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.934
There is no Earth.

21:52.061 --> 21:55.730
Okay, Dad, listen to me. Listen to me!

21:56.399 --> 21:58.233
Pull it together.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.443
I can't. Yes, you can. Come on.

22:00.528 --> 22:01.945
I can't.
Yes, you can.

22:02.029 --> 22:06.366
I can't... I can't kill him. I
can't kill the bastard. I can't.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.076
Okay, okay, Dad.
I can't.

22:08.619 --> 22:12.205
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.665
I'll take care of it.

22:13.749 --> 22:14.874
I can't.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.918
I'll take care of it.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.938
You motherfrakker.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.441
Who are the others?

22:41.777 --> 22:43.611
Where's the old man?

22:45.948 --> 22:47.991
Right where you put him.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.037
Mr. President,
it's the CIC.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.539
D'Anna's on the line.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.551
(SIGHING)

23:08.846 --> 23:09.888
This is the President.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.097
D'ANNA ON RADIO:
Mr. President.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.557
You're running out of time.

23:12.641 --> 23:16.728
No, you are. It's your turn to listen.
You harm another one of my people,

23:16.812 --> 23:23.151
you so much as blacken one of their eyes,
and I flush Saul Tigh out of the launch tube.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.531
We have no wish
for further bloodshed.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.408
May I speak with the Admiral?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.118
No, you deal with me.

23:32.203 --> 23:34.079
You have 10 minutes
to release my people

23:34.163 --> 23:37.749
or you can kiss one of your
precious Final Five goodbye.

23:42.254 --> 23:46.341
You want to save the Fleet, I need
the others, and I need them now.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.554
STARBUCK: It's sitting here the
same way it has been for months.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.099
What made you think
something was happening?

23:54.183 --> 23:58.103
It's hard to explain. You
know, it's just a feeling.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.896
Yeah, I've got
a feeling, too.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.564
You're both out of
your frakking minds.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.733
SAM: You know, you had a
feeling you could find Earth.

24:03.818 --> 24:05.777
I trusted you. I backed
you every step of the way.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.113
Now I need you
to trust ours.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.624
Slowly put your hands on
your heads and face the Viper.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.418
Do it now!

24:24.964 --> 24:26.548
What the hell is going on?

24:26.632 --> 24:28.883
They're Cylons,
just like the XO.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.445
Go ahead.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.119
It's true, Kara.

25:07.715 --> 25:11.217
There's something different about
this Viper, something's changed.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.219
You gotta find it.
WOMAN: Shut up.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.940
Fall back!
Fall back!

25:26.275 --> 25:27.442
Where the hell
are you taking us?

25:27.526 --> 25:28.818
Keep moving, otherwise
we shoot you here.

25:28.903 --> 25:29.944
No!

25:42.958 --> 25:44.959
This is a wild guess.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.794
You told them?

25:46.879 --> 25:49.047
We should've
done it day one.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.591
Get the Baseship
on the horn.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.968
Mr. Hoshi, we need the Baseship.

26:08.108 --> 26:09.776
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

26:14.406 --> 26:15.448
ROSLIN: What's going on?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.408
D'Anna's about to start
executing more hostages.

26:17.493 --> 26:18.868
Okay, take me
to D'Anna.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.370
BALTAR: No,
she won't listen to you.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.872
I was the one with her in the temple
when she had the vision of the Five.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.499
Take me.
He's right.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.584
Take him, it's good.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.594
Are you ready to come to
your senses, Mr. President?

26:36.679 --> 26:41.182
APOLLO: Galen Tyrol and Samuel Anders
have just joined Saul Tigh in the airlock.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.642
They found them.

26:42.726 --> 26:45.937
They're in line for an
express ride into a vacuum.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.357
You want them alive,
stand down.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.371
I know Lee.

27:03.789 --> 27:06.124
Press him and
he'll back down.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.627
Target our nuclear weapons
on the civilian fleet.

27:09.712 --> 27:12.213
We'll see if he wants
to play hardball.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.075
(BEEPING)

27:44.872 --> 27:48.166
Coercion won't work with Lee Adama.
He's too similar to his father.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.292
Lee's bluffing.

27:49.376 --> 27:53.254
He doesn't give a tinker's
damn about those three, not now.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.631
You push him,
he'll kill them.

27:56.425 --> 27:59.093
Then the entire human race
will die with them.

28:11.648 --> 28:14.942
Mr. President, the Baseship
nukes just went hot.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.444
If any of our fleet
starts spooling up...

28:16.528 --> 28:19.864
They won't have time to
jump before the Cylons fire.

28:20.741 --> 28:24.285
Sgt. Harder, clear the
tube of everyone but Tigh.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.871
Corporal.

28:41.428 --> 28:45.056
Do you really think that God brought you
back from the darkness for this, D'Anna?

28:45.140 --> 28:48.476
Maybe he brought you back
for a different purpose.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.894
To end this peacefully.

28:49.978 --> 28:55.066
They will never forgive us for what we
did to the 12 Colonies, never. Proceed.

29:16.130 --> 29:18.631
Brute force did not work
for you on New Caprica.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.802
It didn't work for you on the Algae
Planet. So why is it gonna work for you now?

29:29.935 --> 29:31.519
Give me the key.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.192

30:10.476 --> 30:13.728
Lee, stop!
Stop, stop!

30:15.898 --> 30:18.774

just gave us Earth.

(SIGNAL BEEPING)

30:30.913 --> 30:34.123
Well, it's a Colonial
emergency locator signal.

30:34.666 --> 30:38.169
And no other wireless in
the Fleet is picking this up?

30:38.253 --> 30:39.337
Gaeta's confirmed it.

30:39.421 --> 30:42.298
The channel's empty
except for this Viper.

30:43.550 --> 30:46.385
It's gotta be
a signal from Earth.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.680
You're reaching, Kara.

30:49.765 --> 30:51.265
Come on, Lee, add it up.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.809
I vanish into a storm,
ride this Viper to Earth.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.062
Coming back, I get a vision
that leads me to the Baseship.

30:56.146 --> 30:59.690
Its Hybrid tells me that the Final
Five Cylons have been to Earth,

30:59.775 --> 31:03.152
but we need the missing Three, D'Anna,
to bring them out into the open.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.655
And now we're starting to
get messages from the beyond.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.782
You heard the signal.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.825
The Final Cylons
led me to it.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.954
If it's Earth, they've given us
the home of the Thirteenth Tribe.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.081
Just the way the Hybrid
said it would happen.

31:15.165 --> 31:19.961
Like it or not, Lee, something's
orchestrating this for a purpose.

31:22.005 --> 31:24.382
A higher power.

31:24.466 --> 31:30.012
Call it whatever you want, but it seems
to want us to find Earth with the Cylons.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.121
(SIGNAL BEEPING)

31:57.708 --> 32:00.293
One tiny needle
in the whole Fleet.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.920
Well, you're right.
It's wafer thin.

32:03.171 --> 32:06.007
It's the best I could
do at short notice.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.510
So you're all in agreement
this is the way to Earth?

32:09.595 --> 32:12.930
It's a stretch, but it's the
best explanation we've got.

32:13.015 --> 32:15.725
Which is why we chose to share
this information with you.

32:15.809 --> 32:18.144
We could've jumped away
with it, left you behind.

32:18.228 --> 32:22.315
But that would've led to another
confrontation, another standoff.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.858
All this has
happened before...

32:23.942 --> 32:26.861
But it doesn't have
to happen again.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.655
Not if we make up
our minds to change.

32:30.532 --> 32:33.576
Take a different path.
Right here, right now.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.037
You were afraid we'd
kill these four, and yet,

32:36.121 --> 32:38.539
here they are, standing
right behind you,

32:38.624 --> 32:42.209
free to go or stay.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.795
I've granted them an amnesty.

32:46.340 --> 32:50.468
So the question is,
where do we go from here?

33:00.145 --> 33:01.479
All right.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.899
I'll release your crew.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.236
We go to Earth together.

33:23.251 --> 33:25.503
We've projected a
course toward the signal.

33:25.587 --> 33:30.549
It'll probably take some revising as we
go, but this is our destination right here.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.760

33:34.262 --> 33:38.265
So what are your orders, Admiral?

Are you ready to
take us to our new home?

you again, Madam President.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.452

shortest presidency in Colonial history.

35:21.536 --> 35:26.081
Yes, well, don't look
so relieved, Mr. Adama.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.669
Because you were dealt a crisis
and you knew exactly what to do.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.671
You faced it boldly.

35:32.756 --> 35:37.802
This Fleet is going to need that kind
of leadership in the days to come,

35:37.886 --> 35:40.721
so you are not
off the hook yet.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.224
Thank you.

You guys just gonna sit here flapping
your lips or are we gonna go find Earth?

Frak it. This is
the end of the line.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.614
We've got nowhere
else to go.

35:59.282 --> 36:03.244
And if we give the alliance too
much time, it'll fall apart again.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.830
We gotta roll the hard six.

36:05.914 --> 36:08.165
We all go together,

36:08.250 --> 36:10.417
as fast as we can.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.962
Yes, sir.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.621
Fleet in jump formation.
Standing by.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.874
Board is green.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.543
Ship reports ready
to jump, Admiral.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.629
Very well.

36:57.799 --> 37:02.386
Madam President, without
you we wouldn't have made it.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.307
Give the order.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.772
(CHUCKLES) It's been
a long time coming.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.153
(EXHALING) Okay.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.906
Take us to Earth.

37:28.163 --> 37:31.248
DUALLA ON PA:
In five, four,

37:31.333 --> 37:35.544
three, two, one,

37:36.004 --> 37:37.212
jump.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.936
Jump complete.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.771
GAETA: Dradis is clear.

37:53.855 --> 37:55.648
MAN: Fleet is checking in.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.733
Nav.
Confirming position.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.610
ADAMA: Take your time.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.487
Get it right.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.366
Fleet all present
and accounted for.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.457
Visible constellations
are a match.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.334
(CHUCKLES)

38:31.393 --> 38:33.435
Crew of Galactica,

38:34.646 --> 38:36.855
people of the Fleet,

38:36.940 --> 38:39.441
this is Admiral Adama.

38:39.526 --> 38:43.195
Three years ago, I promised
to lead you to a new home.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.948
We've endured
a difficult journey.

38:46.032 --> 38:49.118
We've all lost,
we've all suffered,

38:49.202 --> 38:53.622
and the truth is, I questioned
whether this day would ever come.

38:53.707 --> 38:57.001
But today, our journey is at an end.

38:58.086 --> 39:01.338
We have arrived at Earth.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.428
(ALL CHEERING)

39:22.235 --> 39:23.610
(WHOOPING)

40:26.508 --> 40:28.967
We made it, kid.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.401
We did it.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.613
You did it.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.619
(BUZZING)

41:41.541 --> 41:43.250
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

41:49.340 --> 41:50.591
Earth.

43:19.764 --> 43:21.265
