02:21.642 --> 02:24.144
Does Ser Hugh have
any family in the capital?

02:24.269 --> 02:25.771
No.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.816
I stood vigil
for him myself last night.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.819
He had no one else.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.782
He'd never worn this armour before.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.827
Bad luck for him -
going against the Mountain.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.121
Who determines the draw?

02:43.247 --> 02:45.374
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.292
Aye.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.628
But who holds the straws?

02:51.547 --> 02:53.882
You've done good work, Sisters.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.597
Life is strange.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.142
Not so many years ago
we fought as enemies at the Trident.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.187
I'm glad we never met
on the field, Ser Barristan.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.524
As is my wife. I don't think
the widow's life would suit her.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.860
You're too modest.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.487
I've seen you cut down
a dozen great knights.

03:15.571 --> 03:19.157
My father once told me
you were the best he'd ever seen.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.202
I never knew the man to be wrong
about matters of combat.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.329
He was a fine man, your father.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.541
What the Mad King
did to him was a terrible crime.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.251
And that lad -

03:29.376 --> 03:31.378
he was a squire
until a few months ago.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.506
How could he afford a new suit of armour?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.967
Perhaps Lord Arryn
left him some money?

03:38.635 --> 03:42.431
- I hear the king wants to joust today.
- Yes, that will never happen.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.267
Robert tends
to do what he wants.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.895
If the king got what
he wanted all the time,

03:48.020 --> 03:50.522
he'd still be fighting
a damned rebellion.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.572
It's made too small, Your Grace.
It won't go.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.408
Your mother was
a dumb whore with a fat arse.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.535
Did you know that?

04:05.621 --> 04:09.082
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.002
He can't even put
a man's armour on him properly.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.963
- You're too fat for your armour.
- Fat?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.548
Fat, is it?

04:17.673 --> 04:20.052
Is that how you speak to your king?

04:27.226 --> 04:29.061
Oh, it's funny, is it?

04:31.522 --> 04:34.024
- No, Your Grace.
- No?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.527
You don't like the Hand's joke?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.946
You're torturing the poor boy.

04:39.029 --> 04:41.740
You heard the Hand.
The king's too fat for his armour.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.785
Go find the breastplate
stretcher - now!

04:46.411 --> 04:50.123
"The breastplate stretcher"?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.334
How long before he figures it out?

04:52.459 --> 04:55.629
- Maybe you should have one invented.
- All right, all right.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.715
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.468
You've no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.930
Why, because I'm king?
Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!

05:05.055 --> 05:07.182
- And who's going to hit you back?
- Anybody who can.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.185
- And the last man in his saddle...
- Will be you.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.690
There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms
would risk hurting you.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.150
Are you telling me
those cowards would let me win?

05:17.276 --> 05:18.944
Aye.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.743
- Drink.
- I'm not thirsty.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.246
Drink. Your king commands it.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.043
Gods,

05:35.127 --> 05:37.629
too fat for my armour.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.175
Your squire -
a Lannister boy?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.760
Mm. A bloody idiot,

05:43.886 --> 05:45.846
but Cersei insisted.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.349
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.352
"Cersei Lannister will make
a good match," he told me.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.147
"You'll need her father on your side."

05:57.107 --> 06:01.111
I thought being king
meant I could do whatever I wanted.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.241
Enough of this.
Let's go watch 'em ride.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.036
At least I can smell
someone else's blood.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.163
- Robert.
- What?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.875
Oh.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.586
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.547
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!

06:34.645 --> 06:37.606
- Where's Arya?
- At her dancing lessons.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.070
The Knight of the Flowers.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.161
Thank you, Ser Loras.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.945
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.

07:25.028 --> 07:27.739
- Hey.
- I can't watch.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.786
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.

07:32.911 --> 07:36.623
- I'll take that bet.
- Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.792
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?

07:38.834 --> 07:41.920
Or a girl from
the pleasure houses of Lys?

07:42.045 --> 07:45.924
- Or you could even buy a friend.
- He's going to die.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.885
Ser Loras rides well.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.167
Such a shame, Littlefinger.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.504
It would have been so nice
for you to have a friend.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.506
And tell me, Lord Renly,

08:25.631 --> 08:27.966
when will you be having your friend?

08:39.061 --> 08:42.231
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.650
Ser Loras would never do that.

08:44.733 --> 08:48.695
- There's no honour in tricks.
- No honour and quite a bit of gold.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.950
Sword!

09:18.475 --> 09:20.561
Leave him be!

09:42.207 --> 09:44.710
Stop this madness
in the name of your king!

09:50.799 --> 09:52.926
Let him go!

10:01.643 --> 10:03.604
I owe you my life, ser.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.898
I'm no ser.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.131
Remove his hood.

10:31.215 --> 10:34.343
♪ On that eve, the captive Imp

10:34.426 --> 10:37.971
♪ Downwards from his horse did limp

10:38.096 --> 10:41.141
♪ No more would he preen and primp

10:41.266 --> 10:42.851
♪ In garb of red and gold ♪

10:42.976 --> 10:44.603
This isn't the Kingsroad.

10:44.728 --> 10:48.565
- You said we were riding for Winterfell.
- I did... Often and loudly.

10:48.690 --> 10:52.236
Very wise.
They'll be out in droves,

10:52.361 --> 10:54.404
looking for me in the wrong place.

10:54.446 --> 10:57.449
Word's probably gotten
to my father by now.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.077
He'll be offering a handsome reward.

11:00.244 --> 11:03.372
Everyone knows
a Lannister always pays his debts.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.791
Would you be so good as to untie me?

11:05.916 --> 11:09.294
- And why would I do that?
- Why not?

11:09.419 --> 11:12.756
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.466
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.511
Shadowcats and hill tribes
are the least of your concerns.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.349
Ah, the eastern road.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.393
We're going to the Vale.

11:24.476 --> 11:28.146
You're taking me to your sister's
to answer for my imagined crimes.

11:28.313 --> 11:32.234
Tell me, Lady Stark,
when was the last time you saw your sister?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.987
- Five years ago.
- She's changed.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.700
She was always a bit touched, but now...
You might as well kill me here.

11:39.783 --> 11:42.995
- I am not a murderer, Lannister.
- Neither am I.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.497
I had nothing to do
with the attempt on your son's life.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.416
- The dagger found...
- What sort of imbecile

11:47.499 --> 11:49.209
arms an assassin with his own blade?

11:49.376 --> 11:51.461
- Should I gag him?
- Why?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.463
Am I starting to make sense?

11:53.589 --> 11:56.383
Rodrik!

12:00.012 --> 12:01.847
My lady, this way.

12:18.614 --> 12:20.449
Untie me.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.493
If I die, what's the point?

12:29.041 --> 12:30.209
Ah!

13:14.378 --> 13:17.130
- Rodrik?
- I'll be fine, my lady.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.259
There's no need to bloody yourself.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.637
Your first?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.849
You need a woman.

13:26.890 --> 13:29.101
Nothing like a woman after a fight.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.146
I'm willing if she is.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.661
Bran.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.498
The Iron Islands.
Sigil - a kraken.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.750
Words - "We do not sow."

13:53.876 --> 13:55.961
- Lords?
- The Greyjoys.

13:56.086 --> 13:59.381
Famed for their skills at archery,
navigation and lovemaking.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.302
And failed rebellions.

14:05.387 --> 14:09.725
Sigil - a stag,
a crowned stag now that Robert's king.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.853
- Good.
- Words - "Ours is the fury."

14:12.936 --> 14:15.522
- Lords - the Baratheons.
- Mm-hm.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.524
The Westerlands.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.735
- Sigil - a lion.
- Mmm.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.863
- Words - "A Lannister always pays his debts."
- No.

14:23.447 --> 14:26.366
A common saying,
but not their official motto.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.493
Lords - the Lannisters.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.496
- We're still on their words.
- I don't know them.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.540
You do know them. Think.

14:33.624 --> 14:36.126
"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken."

14:36.251 --> 14:38.921
- That's House Martell.
- "Righteous in wrath."

14:39.004 --> 14:42.508
- House Hornwood.
- "Family, duty, honour."

14:42.633 --> 14:44.551
Those are Tully words -
your mother's.

14:44.676 --> 14:48.222
- Are we playing a game?
- Family, duty, honour...

14:48.347 --> 14:50.557
- Is that the right order?
- You know it is.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.684
Family comes first?

14:53.477 --> 14:57.064
Your mother had to leave Winterfell
to protect the family.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.608
How can she protect the family

14:59.691 --> 15:02.069
if she's not with her family?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.405
Your mother sat by your bed

15:05.531 --> 15:08.242
for three weeks while you slept.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.452
And then she left!

15:12.204 --> 15:15.207
When you were born, I was the one
who pulled you from your mother.

15:16.792 --> 15:19.294
I placed you in her arms.

15:19.378 --> 15:23.215
From that moment
until the moment she dies,

15:24.216 --> 15:26.760
she will love you.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.554
Absolutely.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.724
- Fiercely.
- Why did she leave?

15:32.808 --> 15:34.685
I still can't tell you,

15:34.768 --> 15:37.271
- but she will be home soon.
- Do you know where she is now?

15:37.396 --> 15:39.022
Today?

15:39.106 --> 15:41.775
- No, I don't.
- Then how can you promise me

15:41.942 --> 15:43.944
she'll be home soon?

15:45.821 --> 15:49.324
Sometimes I worry
you're too smart for your own good.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.870
I'll never shoot another arrow.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.373
And where is that written?

15:56.498 --> 15:59.126
- You need legs to work a bow.
- Hmm.

15:59.251 --> 16:01.712
If the saddle Lord Tyrion
designed actually works,

16:01.837 --> 16:04.298
you could learn
to shoot a bow from horseback.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.133
Really?

16:07.092 --> 16:09.678
Dothraki boys learn
when they're four years old.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.805
Why shouldn't you?

16:26.612 --> 16:28.989
Shh, keep it down.

16:29.114 --> 16:31.575
You're not supposed to be
inside the castle walls.

16:31.700 --> 16:34.953
I thought you were supposed to be
an important person around here.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.372
Important enough for the likes of you.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.792
You're not the only nobleman
in my life, you know.

16:40.876 --> 16:44.379
Who, the Imp?
I'd call him half a nobleman.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.423
Jealous?

16:46.465 --> 16:48.300
Why should I be jealous?

16:48.425 --> 16:51.345
Anyone with a few coppers
in his pocket can own you for the night.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.515
What's a dwarf like down below?

16:54.640 --> 16:56.725
I've always wondered.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.937
- Might surprise you.
- Hmm?

17:00.020 --> 17:04.191
He's good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.

17:05.317 --> 17:07.236
Generous tipper.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.030
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.031
You are jealous.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.784
I'm a Greyjoy.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.036
We've been lords
of the Iron Islands for 300 years.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.955
There's not a family in Westeros
that can look down on us,

17:19.039 --> 17:20.999
not even the Lannisters.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.126
And what about the Starks?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.381
I've been Lord Stark's ward
since I was eight years old.

17:27.506 --> 17:30.884
A ward -
that's a nice word for it.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.846
Your father rebelled
against King Robert and if he does it again...

17:33.929 --> 17:37.140
My father fought
for the freedom of his people.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.894
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.564
You're a very serious boy.

17:43.647 --> 17:46.817
- I'm not a boy.
- Oh, yes, you are.

17:47.442 --> 17:51.822
A serious boy
with a serious cock.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.283
I don't want to pay for it.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.035
Then get yourself a wife.

18:00.205 --> 18:02.583
Come on.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.170
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.846
How is your son, my lord?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.724
He'll never walk again.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.728
But his mind is sound?

18:23.604 --> 18:25.689
So they say.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.900
A blessing, then.

18:28.901 --> 18:32.196
I suffered an early mutilation myself.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.617
Some doors close forever...

18:37.201 --> 18:40.871
others open
in most unexpected places.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.790
May I?

18:48.295 --> 18:51.256
If the wrong ears heard
what I'm about to tell you,

18:51.340 --> 18:53.509
off comes my head.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.178
And who would mourn poor Varys then?

18:56.261 --> 18:59.932
North or South,
they sing no songs for spiders.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.476
But there are things you must know.

19:02.559 --> 19:05.938
You are the King's Hand
and the king is a fool -

19:06.021 --> 19:10.859
your friend, I know, but a fool -
and doomed unless you save him.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.487
I've been in the capital a month.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.366
Why have you waited so long
to tell me this?

19:17.491 --> 19:19.243
I didn't trust you.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.745
So why do you trust me now?

19:22.621 --> 19:26.667
The queen is not the only one
who has been watching you closely.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.919
There are few men of honour
in the capital.

19:28.961 --> 19:30.754
You are one of them.

19:30.879 --> 19:34.800
I would like to believe I am another
strange as that may seem.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.469
What sort of doom does the king face?

19:37.636 --> 19:40.305
The same sort as Jon Arryn.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.393
The tears of lys, they call it.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.854
A rare and costly thing,

19:46.937 --> 19:50.440
as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.

19:59.825 --> 20:01.535
Who gave it to him?

20:01.702 --> 20:04.746
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?

20:04.830 --> 20:09.084
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.336
There was one boy.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.006
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.

20:15.048 --> 20:17.092
The squire, Ser Hugh?

20:19.094 --> 20:21.096
Pity, what happened to him,

20:21.221 --> 20:24.349
just when his life seemed to be
going so nicely.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.562
If Ser Hugh poisoned him...

20:29.855 --> 20:32.107
who paid Ser Hugh?

20:33.066 --> 20:37.571
- Someone who could afford it.
- Jon was a man of peace.

20:37.696 --> 20:41.158
He was Hand for 17 years -
17 good years.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.160
Why kill him?

20:44.036 --> 20:47.372
He started asking questions.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.695
He's found
one bastard already.

21:19.321 --> 21:20.989
He has the book.

21:21.114 --> 21:23.033
The rest will come.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.452
And when he knows the truth,
what will he do?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.287
The gods alone know.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.415
The fools tried to kill his son.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.252
What's worse -
they botched it.

21:35.712 --> 21:38.465
The wolf and the lion
will be at each other's throats.

21:39.216 --> 21:42.344
- We will be at war soon, my friend.
- What good is war now?

21:42.386 --> 21:44.471
We're not ready.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.182
If one Hand can die,
why not a second?

21:47.266 --> 21:49.893
This Hand is not the other.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.520
We need time.

21:51.687 --> 21:54.815
Khal Drogo will not make his move
until his son is born.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.318
- You know what these savages are.
- "Delay," you say.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.404
"Move fast," I reply.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.782
This is no longer
a game for two players.

22:03.949 --> 22:05.951
It never was.

22:25.179 --> 22:28.515
The first to arrive
and the last to leave.

22:29.933 --> 22:32.186
I admire your industry.

22:32.311 --> 22:34.897
You do move quietly.

22:35.022 --> 22:37.524
We all have our qualities.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.527
You look a bit lonely today.

22:40.694 --> 22:43.030
You should pay a visit
to my brothel this evening.

22:43.113 --> 22:45.574
- First boy is on the house.
- I think you're mistaking

22:45.657 --> 22:48.577
- business with pleasure.
- Am I?

22:50.370 --> 22:54.374
All those birds that whisper in your ear -
such pretty little things.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.920
Trust me,

22:58.462 --> 23:00.672
we accommodate all inclinations.

23:01.632 --> 23:05.802
Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne
likes his boys very young, I hear.

23:05.928 --> 23:10.724
I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion -
both equally important.

23:10.849 --> 23:15.521
Though I suppose beauty
is a subjective quality, no?

23:15.646 --> 23:20.067
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone
prefers amputees?

23:20.234 --> 23:22.903
All desires are valid
to a man with a full purse.

23:22.986 --> 23:26.448
And I heard the most awful rumour
about a certain lord

23:26.573 --> 23:28.575
with a taste for fresh cadavers.

23:29.368 --> 23:32.871
Must be enormously difficult
to accommodate that inclination.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.915
The logistics alone...

23:34.998 --> 23:38.293
to find beautiful corpses
before they rot.

23:38.377 --> 23:42.506
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be
in accordance with the king's laws.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.008
Strictly speaking.

23:47.970 --> 23:52.724
Tell me. Does someone somewhere
keep your balls in a little box?

23:54.226 --> 23:56.270
I've often wondered.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.481
Do you know,
I have no idea where they are.

23:59.606 --> 24:03.318
And we had been so close.

24:03.402 --> 24:05.112
But enough about me.
How have you been

24:05.237 --> 24:07.322
since we last saw each other?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.950
Since you last saw me
or since I last saw you?

24:10.075 --> 24:13.453
Now the last time I saw you,
you were talking to the Hand of the King.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.331
- Saw me with your own eyes?
- Eyes I own.

24:16.415 --> 24:17.958
Council business.

24:18.041 --> 24:21.086
We all have so much
to discuss with Ned Stark.

24:21.170 --> 24:26.175
Everyone's well aware of
your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife.

24:27.301 --> 24:30.721
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt
on the Stark boy's life

24:30.804 --> 24:36.143
and it was discovered that you helped
the Starks come to that conclusion...

24:36.226 --> 24:39.271
to think a simple word to the queen...

24:39.396 --> 24:41.690
- One shudders at the thought.
- Ooh.

24:41.773 --> 24:44.234
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you

24:44.359 --> 24:46.278
even more recently
than you have seen me.

24:46.403 --> 24:49.156
- Have you?
- Yes.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.991
Earlier today, I distinctly recall

24:51.074 --> 24:53.535
seeing you talking
to Lord Stark in his chambers.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.787
Was that you under the bed?

24:55.913 --> 24:57.831
And not long after that

24:57.915 --> 25:00.584
when I saw you escorting a certain

25:01.210 --> 25:03.754
foreign dignitary...

25:03.837 --> 25:06.215
Council business?

25:06.340 --> 25:09.551
Of course, you would have friends
from across the Narrow Sea.

25:09.635 --> 25:12.221
You're from there yourself, after all.

25:12.346 --> 25:15.516
We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys?

25:15.891 --> 25:17.851
I'd like to think we are.

25:17.935 --> 25:20.145
So you can imagine my burden,

25:20.270 --> 25:23.941
wondering if the king
might question my friend's sympathies.

25:23.982 --> 25:28.028
To stand at a crossroads
where turning left means loyalty to a friend,

25:28.070 --> 25:29.947
turning right loyalty to the realm...

25:29.988 --> 25:32.366
- Oh, please.
- To find myself in a position

25:32.491 --> 25:34.409
where a simple word to the king...

25:34.576 --> 25:36.662
What are you two conspiring about?

25:37.704 --> 25:40.082
Well, whatever it is,
you'd best hurry up.

25:40.123 --> 25:43.210
- My brother is coming.
- To a small council meeting?

25:43.293 --> 25:46.213
Disturbing news from far away.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.883
Hadn't you heard?

26:18.954 --> 26:20.914
Off with you. No begging.

26:20.998 --> 26:22.916
I'm not a beggar.
I live here.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.200
D'you want a smack on your ear
to help you with your hearing?

26:25.210 --> 26:27.129
I want to see my father.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.965
I want to fuck the queen,
for all the good it does me.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.800
You want your father, boy?

26:31.925 --> 26:36.013
He's lying on the floor of some tavern,
getting pissed on by his friends.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.557
My father is Hand of the King!

26:38.724 --> 26:41.226
I'm not a boy.
I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell.

26:41.310 --> 26:44.730
And if you lay a hand on me, my father
will have both your heads on spikes.

26:44.813 --> 26:47.816
Now are you going to let me by
or do I need to smack you

26:47.900 --> 26:50.402
on the ear to help with your hearing?

26:52.029 --> 26:55.073
You know I had half my guard
out searching for you?

26:58.327 --> 27:01.788
- You promised me this would stop.
- They said they were going to kill you.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.541
- Who did?
- I didn't see them,

27:04.708 --> 27:06.460
- but I think one was fat.
- Oh, Arya.

27:06.585 --> 27:09.213
I'm not lying!
They said you found the bastard

27:09.296 --> 27:12.216
and the wolves are fighting
the lions and the savage...

27:12.341 --> 27:14.051
Something about the savage.

27:14.176 --> 27:16.470
- Where did you hear this?
- In the dungeons,

27:16.553 --> 27:19.806
- near the dragon skulls.
- What were you doing in the dungeons?

27:21.308 --> 27:23.018
Chasing a cat.

27:25.604 --> 27:26.855
Pardon, my lord.

27:26.939 --> 27:30.234
There's a night's watchman here
begging a word. Says it's urgent.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.160
- Your name, friend?
- Yoren, if it please.

27:41.453 --> 27:44.331
- This must be your son. He has the look.
- I'm a girl!

27:44.414 --> 27:46.041
Did Benjen send you?

27:46.166 --> 27:50.170
No one sent me, my lord.
I'm here to find men for the Wall

27:50.295 --> 27:53.841
see if there's any scum in the dungeons
that might be fit for service.

27:53.966 --> 27:56.552
- Oh, we'll find recruits for you.
- Thank you, my lord.

27:56.677 --> 27:59.012
But that's not why I disturb you now.

28:00.305 --> 28:03.141
Your brother Benjen,
his blood runs black -

28:03.225 --> 28:05.310
makes him as much
my brother as yours.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.816
It's for his sake I rode here so hard
I damn near killed my horse.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.609
There are others riding too.

28:13.068 --> 28:15.237
The whole city will know by tomorrow.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.698
Know what?

28:17.781 --> 28:20.367
Best said in private, my lord.

28:26.081 --> 28:29.042
Go on. We'll talk more later.

28:29.668 --> 28:32.129
Jory, take her safely to her room.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.673
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.

28:40.721 --> 28:45.475
- How many guards does my father have?
- Here in King's Landing? Fifty.

28:45.601 --> 28:48.187
You wouldn't let anyone
kill him, would you?

28:48.270 --> 28:51.023
No fear on that count, little lady.

28:55.736 --> 28:59.114
- Well?
- It's about your wife, my lord.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.243
She's taken the Imp.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.303
You're far from home, Lady Stark.

29:21.386 --> 29:25.933
- To whom do I speak?
- Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.

29:26.058 --> 29:30.229
- Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
- There was no time to send word.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.523
May I ask, my lady,

29:32.606 --> 29:34.441
why he is with you?

29:34.566 --> 29:37.194
That's why there was no time.

29:37.277 --> 29:39.947
- He is my prisoner.
- He doesn't look like a prisoner.

29:40.113 --> 29:43.283
My sister will decide what he looks like.

29:43.867 --> 29:47.037
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.

29:53.085 --> 29:56.505
The Eyrie.
They say it's impregnable.

29:57.798 --> 30:00.259
Give me ten good men
and some climbing spikes,

30:00.384 --> 30:02.594
I'll impregnate the bitch.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.430
I like you.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.276
Lord Stark, your presence
has been requested

30:17.401 --> 30:19.695
in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.905
I need to see the king first - alone.

30:21.947 --> 30:24.283
The king is at
the small council meeting, my lord.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.368
He has summoned you.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.371
- Is it about my wife?
- No, my lord.

30:29.454 --> 30:32.124
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.

30:32.291 --> 30:36.545
- The whore is pregnant.
- You're speaking of murdering a child.

30:36.670 --> 30:39.047
I warned you this would happen,
back in the North.

30:39.131 --> 30:41.800
I warned you, but you didn't care to hear.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.136
Well, hear it now.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.723
I want 'em dead,
mother and child both.

30:47.848 --> 30:49.892
And that fool Viserys as well.

30:50.017 --> 30:53.395
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.023
You will dishonour yourself
forever if you do this.

30:56.106 --> 30:59.735
Honour?!
I've got seven kingdoms to rule!

30:59.860 --> 31:02.946
One king, seven kingdoms.

31:03.030 --> 31:05.282
Do you think honour keeps them in line?

31:05.407 --> 31:07.534
Do you think it's honour
that's keeping the peace?

31:07.659 --> 31:12.039
- It's fear - fear and blood.
- Then we're no better than the Mad King.

31:12.122 --> 31:16.418
- Careful, Ned. Careful now.
- You want to assassinate a girl

31:16.543 --> 31:18.086
because the spider heard a rumour?

31:18.170 --> 31:21.006
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.

31:21.048 --> 31:24.426
- Based on whose information?
- Ser Jorah Mormont.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.762
He is serving as advisor
to the Targaryens.

31:26.845 --> 31:29.264
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers

31:29.389 --> 31:32.976
of a traitor half a world away
and call it fact?

31:33.060 --> 31:35.771
Jorah Mormont's a slaver
not a traitor.

31:35.896 --> 31:38.232
Small difference, I know,
to an honourable man.

31:38.315 --> 31:42.027
He broke the law,
betrayed his family, fled our land.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.154
We commit murder
on the word of this man?

31:44.238 --> 31:47.908
And if he's right?
If she has a son?

31:48.033 --> 31:51.286
A Targaryen at the head
of a Dothraki army -

31:51.453 --> 31:55.249
- what then?
- The Narrow Sea still lies between us.

31:55.374 --> 31:59.503
I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach
their horses to run on water.

31:59.628 --> 32:01.547
Do nothing?

32:01.672 --> 32:03.966
That's your wise advice?

32:04.049 --> 32:07.636
Do nothing till our enemies
are on our shores?

32:07.719 --> 32:09.847
You're my council.
Counsel!

32:09.972 --> 32:13.642
Speak sense to this honourable fool.

32:13.725 --> 32:17.646
I understand your misgivings, my lord.

32:17.771 --> 32:20.315
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing

32:20.440 --> 32:22.442
we must consider, a vile thing.

32:22.568 --> 32:24.820
Yet we who presume to rule

32:24.903 --> 32:26.989
must sometimes do vile things

32:27.072 --> 32:29.324
for the good of the realm.

32:29.366 --> 32:32.786
Should the gods
grant Daenerys a son,

32:32.911 --> 32:36.748
- the realm will bleed.
- I bear this girl no ill will,

32:36.874 --> 32:40.669
but should the Dothraki invade,
how many innocents will die?

32:40.794 --> 32:43.130
How many towns will burn?

32:43.213 --> 32:46.466
Is it not wiser, kinder even,

32:46.592 --> 32:51.805
that she should die now
so that tens of thousands might live?

32:51.930 --> 32:54.474
We should have had them
both killed years ago.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.852
When you find yourself
in bed with an ugly woman,

32:56.977 --> 33:00.230
best close your eyes,
get it over with.

33:00.355 --> 33:03.442
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.

33:09.907 --> 33:12.492
I followed you into war -

33:12.618 --> 33:14.620
twice,

33:14.745 --> 33:16.538
without doubts,

33:16.705 --> 33:18.707
without second thoughts.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.585
But I will not follow you now.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.588
The Robert I grew up with

33:24.755 --> 33:28.175
didn't tremble at the shadow
of an unborn child.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.054
She dies.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.390
I will have no part in it.

33:35.516 --> 33:37.684
You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.

33:37.851 --> 33:41.313
You'll do as I command
or I'll find me a Hand who will.

33:50.197 --> 33:52.491
And good luck to him.

33:52.533 --> 33:56.370
- I thought you were a better man.
- Out. Out, damn you.

33:56.453 --> 33:58.163
I'm done with you.

33:59.289 --> 34:02.334
Go, run back to Winterfell!

34:02.417 --> 34:04.753
I'll have your head on a spike!

34:06.213 --> 34:09.091
I'll put it there myself, you fool!

34:09.174 --> 34:11.092
You think you're too good for this?

34:11.217 --> 34:14.137
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!

34:17.014 --> 34:20.101
I'll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready. Do it yourself.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.021
- Don't ask anyone for help.
- Right away, my lord.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.649
Lord Baelish is here for you.

34:26.984 --> 34:29.360
His Grace went on about you
at some length

34:29.485 --> 34:33.322
after you took your leave.
The word "treason" was mentioned.

34:34.783 --> 34:38.203
- What can I do for you?
- When do you return to Winterfell?

34:38.328 --> 34:41.206
- Why? What do you care?
- If you're still here come nightfall,

34:41.290 --> 34:45.002
I'll take you to see the last person
Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.

34:45.127 --> 34:47.588
If that sort of thing still interests you.

34:48.547 --> 34:50.299
I don't have the time.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.467
It won't take more than an hour.
But as you please.

34:58.849 --> 35:02.102
Round up all the men we have
and station them outside the girls' chambers.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.689
- Who are your best two swords?
- Heward and Wyl.

35:05.731 --> 35:08.901
Find them and meet me at the stables.

35:13.780 --> 35:16.366
You bring him here without permission?

35:16.950 --> 35:19.286
You pollute my home with his presence?

35:22.372 --> 35:26.752
Your aunt has done a bad thing,
Robin, a very bad thing.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.378
You remember her, don't you?

35:29.922 --> 35:31.757
Isn't he beautiful?

35:31.798 --> 35:34.885
And strong too. Jon knew it.

35:34.927 --> 35:37.846
His last words were
"The seed is strong."

35:37.930 --> 35:40.432
He wanted everyone to know
what a good, strong boy

35:40.557 --> 35:43.060
his son would grow up to be.

35:43.185 --> 35:46.313
Look at him,
the lord of all the Vale.

35:46.396 --> 35:48.649
Lysa,

35:48.815 --> 35:51.193
you wrote me about the Lannisters,

35:51.276 --> 35:54.321
- warning me...
- To stay away from them!

35:54.404 --> 35:56.990
Not to bring one here!

35:57.157 --> 35:59.409
Mummy...

35:59.493 --> 36:02.538
- is that the bad man?
- It is.

36:04.665 --> 36:06.917
He's little.

36:07.125 --> 36:09.253
He's Tyrion the Imp,
of House Lannister.

36:10.504 --> 36:13.298
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!

36:13.423 --> 36:15.884
Oh, did I kill him too?

36:16.009 --> 36:20.097
- I've been a very busy man.
- You will watch your tongue!

36:21.098 --> 36:23.016
These men are knights of the Vale.

36:23.183 --> 36:25.811
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.813
Every one of them would die for me.

36:27.980 --> 36:31.400
If any harm comes to me,
my brother Jaime will see that they do.

36:31.525 --> 36:34.403
You can't hurt us.
No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mummy!

36:34.486 --> 36:38.323
- Tell him!
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, my sweet boy.

36:38.866 --> 36:42.870
He's just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.

36:43.579 --> 36:45.706
No one will hurt my baby.

36:45.831 --> 36:47.499
Mummy...

36:48.375 --> 36:51.044
I want to see the bad man fly.

36:53.088 --> 36:56.425
- Perhaps you will, my little love.
- This man is my prisoner.

36:57.134 --> 37:00.012
I will not have him harmed.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.140
Ser Vardis,

37:03.682 --> 37:06.018
my sister's guest is weary.

37:06.643 --> 37:08.729
Take him down below
so he can rest.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.730
Introduce him to Mord.

37:14.359 --> 37:16.653
You go sleep, dwarf man.

37:16.737 --> 37:18.822
Sleep good, little dwarf man!

37:54.608 --> 37:56.944
Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.738
Robert will rant for a few days,
but he won't do anything.

37:59.863 --> 38:02.950
- He adores the man.
- You're jealous.

38:04.034 --> 38:06.662
- Are you sure this won't hurt?
- Only if I slip.

38:10.791 --> 38:14.086
- And you'd prefer me like this?
- Mm-hm.

38:14.169 --> 38:16.672
If you want hairless,
maybe you should find a little boy.

38:16.755 --> 38:18.799
I want you.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.970
My brother thinks that anyone
who hasn't been to war isn't a man.

38:23.095 --> 38:25.514
He treats me as if I'm a spoilt child.

38:27.099 --> 38:28.767
Oh, and you're not?

38:29.726 --> 38:32.020
Loras Tyrell,
the Knight of the Flowers?

38:32.145 --> 38:34.314
How many wars have you fought in?

38:34.356 --> 38:37.693
Oh, and how much did your father spend
on that armour of yours?

38:37.818 --> 38:39.653
Hold still.

38:40.821 --> 38:43.699
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis
is how I'm not tough enough,

38:43.782 --> 38:45.576
how I squirm at the sight of blood.

38:45.701 --> 38:48.328
You did vomit when that boy's eye
was knocked out in the melee.

38:48.412 --> 38:50.372
His eye was dangling
out of the damn socket!

38:50.455 --> 38:53.095
He shouldn't have entered the melee
if he didn't know how to fight.

38:53.166 --> 38:56.336
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.

38:56.461 --> 38:58.922
It's not a gift.
No one gave it to me.

38:59.006 --> 39:00.883
I'm good because I work at it -

39:00.966 --> 39:03.760
every day of my life
since I could hold a stick.

39:04.178 --> 39:07.931
I could work at fighting all day, every day,
I'd still never be as good as you.

39:08.056 --> 39:10.434
Yes, well, I guess we'll never know.

39:20.485 --> 39:22.946
- Everywhere?
- Everywhere.

39:23.113 --> 39:25.365
So how did it end up?

39:25.449 --> 39:30.537
- The Targaryen girl will die?
- It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.

39:30.621 --> 39:32.664
Robert's rather tasteless about it.

39:32.748 --> 39:36.293
Every time he talks about killing her,
I swear the table rises six inches.

39:36.376 --> 39:39.254
It's a shame he can't muster
the same enthusiasm for his wife.

39:39.379 --> 39:41.715
He does have a deep,
abiding lust for her money.

39:41.882 --> 39:44.259
You have to give it
to the Lannisters - they may be

39:44.343 --> 39:47.638
the most pompous, ponderous cunts
the gods ever suffered to walk the world,

39:47.763 --> 39:50.390
but they do have
outrageous amounts of money.

39:51.725 --> 39:55.646
- I have an outrageous amount of money.
- Not as much as the Lannisters.

39:55.771 --> 39:59.191
But a lot more than you.

39:59.775 --> 40:02.569
Robert's threatening
to take me hunting with him.

40:02.736 --> 40:04.696
Last time we were out there
for two weeks.

40:04.863 --> 40:07.241
Tramping through the trees
in the rain, day after day,

40:07.407 --> 40:10.410
all so he can stick his spear
into something's flesh.

40:10.577 --> 40:13.914
Oh. But Robert loves his killing.

40:13.997 --> 40:15.958
- And he's the king.
- Hmm.

40:16.041 --> 40:19.586
- How did that ever happen?
- Because he loves his killing.

40:19.670 --> 40:21.713
And he used to be good at it.

40:22.714 --> 40:25.092
Do you know who should be king?

40:25.509 --> 40:27.469
- Be serious.
- I am.

40:27.553 --> 40:29.721
My father could be your bank.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.765
I've never fought in a war before,

40:31.932 --> 40:34.643
- but I'd fight for you.
- I'm fourth in line.

40:34.726 --> 40:37.771
And where's Robert
in the line of royal succession?

40:37.855 --> 40:40.107
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.

40:40.274 --> 40:42.734
- Stannis?
- Stannis has the personality of a lobster.

40:42.943 --> 40:45.028
He's still my older brother.

40:45.445 --> 40:47.573
- What are you doing?!
- Look at it.

40:47.698 --> 40:49.898
- You cut me.
- It's just blood. We've all got it in us.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.244
Sometimes a little spills.

40:52.828 --> 40:55.539
If you become king,
you're going to see a lot of this.

40:55.622 --> 40:57.833
You need to get used to it.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.918
Go on. Look.

41:01.920 --> 41:04.089
People love you.

41:05.299 --> 41:07.593
They love to serve you
because you're kind to them.

41:08.135 --> 41:10.179
They want to be near you.

41:12.347 --> 41:15.225
You're willing to do
what needs to be done,

41:16.268 --> 41:18.520
but you don't gloat over it.

41:18.604 --> 41:20.397
You don't love killing.

41:23.066 --> 41:28.113
Where is it written that power
is the sole province of the worst?

41:28.947 --> 41:33.035
That thrones are only made
for the hated and the feared?

41:36.413 --> 41:38.540
You would be a wonderful king.

41:56.391 --> 41:59.728
I'm sorry your marriage
to Ned Stark didn't work out.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.438
You seemed so good together.

42:01.563 --> 42:04.858
I'm glad I could do something
to make you happy.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.822
Without a Hand,
everything will fall to pieces.

42:10.948 --> 42:15.619
I suppose this is where you tell me
to give the job to your brother Jaime.

42:15.744 --> 42:17.120
No.

42:17.287 --> 42:19.289
He's not serious enough.

42:20.374 --> 42:23.377
I'll say this for Ned Stark -
he's serious enough.

42:23.544 --> 42:24.586
Hmm.

42:24.711 --> 42:28.298
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?

42:28.382 --> 42:30.259
I don't know.

42:32.845 --> 42:34.513
But I do know this -

42:35.514 --> 42:40.769
if the Targaryen girl convinces
her horselord husband to invade

42:40.894 --> 42:44.147
and the Dothraki horde
crosses the Narrow Sea...

42:46.275 --> 42:47.943
we won't be able to stop them.

42:48.068 --> 42:50.404
The Dothraki don't sail.
Every child knows that.

42:50.487 --> 42:53.740
They don't have discipline.
They don't have armour.

42:53.866 --> 42:57.327
- They don't have siege weapons.
- It's a neat little trick you do -

42:57.452 --> 43:00.455
you move your lips
and your father's voice comes out.

43:00.581 --> 43:03.584
Is my father wrong?

43:07.379 --> 43:09.965
Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands

43:10.090 --> 43:13.677
with 40,000 Dothraki screamers at his back.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.138
We hole up in our castles.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.973
A wise move -

43:18.056 --> 43:21.727
only a fool would meet
the Dothraki in an open field.

43:22.519 --> 43:24.688
They leave us in our castles.

43:24.771 --> 43:28.275
They go from town to town,
looting and burning,

43:28.358 --> 43:32.154
killing every man
who can't hide behind a stone wall

43:32.321 --> 43:34.740
stealing all our crops and livestock,

43:34.907 --> 43:37.784
enslaving all our women and children.

43:37.868 --> 43:40.329
How long do the people
of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind

43:40.412 --> 43:43.665
their absentee king,
their cowardly king

43:43.832 --> 43:46.210
hiding behind high walls?

43:46.376 --> 43:49.171
When do the people decide
that Viserys Targaryen

43:49.254 --> 43:51.673
is the rightful monarch after all?

43:53.300 --> 43:55.469
We still outnumber them.

43:56.845 --> 44:00.140
Which is the bigger number -
five or one?

44:01.558 --> 44:02.643
Five.

44:03.727 --> 44:05.521
Five...

44:07.397 --> 44:09.441
One.

44:09.525 --> 44:11.735
One army - a real army

44:11.818 --> 44:15.697
united behind one leader
with one purpose.

44:17.407 --> 44:21.495
Our purpose died with the Mad King.

44:22.037 --> 44:23.747
Now we've got as many armies

44:24.289 --> 44:27.751
as there are men
with gold in their purse.

44:27.835 --> 44:29.837
And everybody wants
something different.

44:29.920 --> 44:32.130
Your father wants to own the world.

44:32.297 --> 44:35.551
Ned Stark wants to run away
and bury his head in the snow.

44:35.634 --> 44:37.678
What do you want?

44:47.646 --> 44:51.316
We haven't had
a real fight in nine years.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.527
Backstabbing doesn't prepare you
for a fight.

44:53.652 --> 44:55.696
And that's all the realm is now -

44:55.821 --> 44:57.906
backstabbing and scheming

44:57.990 --> 45:01.034
and arse-licking
and money-grubbing.

45:02.035 --> 45:04.830
Sometimes I don't know
what holds it together.

45:05.831 --> 45:08.959
Our marriage.

45:17.217 --> 45:19.720
Ah, so here we sit,

45:20.721 --> 45:24.558
17 years later,
holding it all together.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.145
Don't you get tired?

45:28.729 --> 45:30.731
Every day.

45:31.982 --> 45:34.943
How long can hate
hold a thing together?

45:35.027 --> 45:39.031
Well, 17 years is quite a long time.

45:39.990 --> 45:41.700
Yes, it is.

45:42.326 --> 45:44.036
Yes, it is.

45:49.541 --> 45:52.002
What was she like?

45:54.004 --> 45:56.215
You've never asked
about her, not once.

45:56.340 --> 45:57.799
Why not?

45:58.759 --> 46:02.471
At first, just saying her name
even in private

46:02.596 --> 46:05.766
felt like I was breathing life
back into her.

46:06.517 --> 46:10.646
I thought if I didn't talk about her,
she'd just fade away for you.

46:10.771 --> 46:13.607
When I realised
that wasn't going to happen,

46:13.732 --> 46:15.776
I refused to ask out of spite.

46:16.693 --> 46:21.406
I didn't want to give you the satisfaction
of thinking I cared enough to ask.

46:21.490 --> 46:24.826
And eventually it became clear
that my spite didn't mean anything to you.

46:24.910 --> 46:27.829
As far as I could tell
you actually enjoyed it.

46:28.205 --> 46:29.873
So why now?

46:31.667 --> 46:36.004
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost
do to either of us

46:36.088 --> 46:39.258
that we haven't done to each other
a hundred times over?

46:42.803 --> 46:45.138
You want to know the horrible truth?

46:48.308 --> 46:50.394
I can't even remember
what she looked like.

46:53.939 --> 46:58.652
I only know she was
the one thing I ever wanted.

47:00.863 --> 47:03.156
Someone took her away from me,

47:04.491 --> 47:08.579
and seven kingdoms
couldn't fill the hole she left behind.

47:12.624 --> 47:15.002
I felt something
for you once, you know?

47:16.295 --> 47:18.088
I know.

47:18.672 --> 47:21.008
Even after we lost our first boy.

47:23.093 --> 47:24.845
For quite a while, actually.

47:29.266 --> 47:33.604
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?

47:41.028 --> 47:42.029
No.

47:46.491 --> 47:49.536
Does that make you feel better or worse?

47:54.041 --> 47:56.335
It doesn't make me feel anything.

48:10.891 --> 48:12.809
She looks like him,

48:12.935 --> 48:14.853
don't she, my lord?

48:14.978 --> 48:17.898
She has his nose,
his black hair.

48:18.857 --> 48:20.442
Aye.

48:20.567 --> 48:22.528
Tell him when you see him, my lord.

48:22.653 --> 48:26.907
If it please you,
tell him how beautiful she is.

48:28.617 --> 48:32.204
- I will.
- And tell him I've been with no one else.

48:32.287 --> 48:35.749
I swear it, my lord,
by the old gods and new.

48:35.874 --> 48:37.960
I don't want no jewels or nothing,

48:38.085 --> 48:39.795
just him.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.505
The king was always good to me.

48:41.630 --> 48:43.757
When Jon Arryn came to visit you,

48:44.550 --> 48:48.011
- what did he want?
- He wasn't that sort of man, my lord.

48:48.136 --> 48:50.931
He just wanted to know
if the child was happy,

48:51.056 --> 48:53.058
healthy.

48:55.853 --> 48:57.896
Looks healthy enough to me.

48:59.773 --> 49:01.942
The girl shall want for nothing.

49:08.031 --> 49:10.450
Brothels make a much better
investment than ships,

49:10.534 --> 49:12.202
I've found.

49:12.327 --> 49:14.621
Whores rarely sink.

49:19.168 --> 49:21.753
What do you know
of King Robert's bastards?

49:21.837 --> 49:25.340
Well, he has more than you, for a start.

49:25.966 --> 49:28.010
- How many?
- Does it matter?

49:28.093 --> 49:30.971
If you fuck enough women,
some of them will give you presents.

49:31.096 --> 49:33.015
And Jon Arryn
tracked them all down. Why?

49:33.140 --> 49:36.018
He was the King's Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.

49:36.101 --> 49:39.313
He was overcome with fatherly love.

49:42.316 --> 49:43.817
Come.

49:50.157 --> 49:52.201
- Jory!
- My lord.

50:11.261 --> 50:13.263
Such a small pack of wolves.

50:14.848 --> 50:17.184
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.

50:17.267 --> 50:19.228
Was the Hand of the King.

50:19.353 --> 50:23.273
Now I'm not sure what he is -
Lord of somewhere very far away.

50:23.732 --> 50:25.567
What's the meaning of this, Lannister?

50:25.692 --> 50:29.905
Get back inside where it's safe.
I'm looking for my brother.

50:30.030 --> 50:31.813
You remember my brother,
don't you, Lord Stark?

50:31.823 --> 50:35.953
Blond hair,
sharp tongue, short man.

50:36.787 --> 50:40.249
- I remember him well.
- It seems he had some trouble on the road.

50:40.374 --> 50:43.168
You wouldn't know
what happened to him, would you?

50:43.252 --> 50:47.631
He was taken at my command
to answer for his crimes.

50:47.714 --> 50:50.259
My lords!

50:50.384 --> 50:52.886
I'll bring the City Watch.

50:54.680 --> 50:58.308
Come, Stark.
I'd rather you die sword in hand.

50:58.433 --> 51:00.394
- If you threaten my lord again...
- Threaten?

51:00.519 --> 51:03.438
As in, "I'm going to open your lord

51:03.564 --> 51:07.150
"from balls to brains
and see what Starks are made of'?

51:07.609 --> 51:10.112
You kill me,

51:10.237 --> 51:12.698
your brother's a dead man.

51:12.823 --> 51:14.575
You're right.

51:14.700 --> 51:17.369
Take him alive. Kill his men.

52:25.854 --> 52:27.648
Yah!

52:52.506 --> 52:56.134
My brother, Lord Stark -
we want him back.

53:07.475 --> 53:13.061
JORY'S SCENE IN THE BROTHEL REALLY CRACKS ME UP.
