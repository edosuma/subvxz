00:07.075 --> 00:09.243
Oh, Tiffany,
I can't kiss you.

00:09.277 --> 00:11.712
I'm about to perform
surgery on you.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.681
My inflamed
spleen can wait.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.216
This love can't.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.551
(woman coughing)

00:17.585 --> 00:19.553
(woman over PA)
Paging Dr. Statement,
Dr. Statement, please.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.921
(coughing)

00:20.954 --> 00:22.856
Rachel, sick again?

00:22.890 --> 00:24.058
What a surprise.

00:24.092 --> 00:26.394
I feel terrible.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.230
I'm gonna need a ton
of antibiotics.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.099
Plus a full body CAT scan.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.034
Complete blood work for all
diseases native to California.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.736
And two lollipops
from that bowl there.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.205
(sniffles)
Cherry, please.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.373
You know the tenth visit
isn't free, right?

00:39.407 --> 00:40.674
Don't care.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.009
I took the whole
day off from work,

00:42.042 --> 00:43.611
so I'm not taking
any chances.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.579
I just need
to be healthy.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.747
Just give me everything.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.716
Actually, when it comes
to medicine,

00:48.749 --> 00:51.685
getting everything
could make you less healthy.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.754
I'd also like
my eyes checked.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.225
No, I'm real, and I've got
exactly what you need.

00:57.258 --> 00:58.226
Medicine?

00:58.259 --> 01:00.194
Knowledge, 'cause
I'm Adam Conover.

01:00.228 --> 01:01.195
And this is--

01:01.229 --> 01:02.196
(sneezes)
Bless you.

01:02.230 --> 01:03.197
And this is--

01:03.231 --> 01:04.198
(sneezes)
Bless you.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.533
"Adam Ruins Everything."
(sneezes)

01:05.566 --> 01:07.435
You know what?
Let's just roll the intro.

01:07.468 --> 01:11.772

truTV

01:16.910 --> 01:18.912
Hold up, Dr. Dingbat.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.482
Of course I want as much
medical care as possible.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.550
What could be
the downside?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.917
Oh, there are a ton.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.819
For starters, how 'bout
the fact that this place

01:25.853 --> 01:28.789
rips off folks
like you every day.

01:28.822 --> 01:29.790
Whatever.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.792
I know the hospital
is expensive,

01:31.825 --> 01:33.494
but it is worth it
if I get the best treatment.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.928
No, it isn't.

01:34.962 --> 01:37.598
American health care
is not the best in the world.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.168
But despite that, we spend more
per person annually

01:40.201 --> 01:42.970
on health care than any
other developed nation.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.472
And a big part
of the reason for that

01:44.505 --> 01:48.309
is that American hospitals
overcharge patients massively.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.477
(music playing,
cheering and applause)

01:49.510 --> 01:51.579
This neck brace
is worth $20.

01:51.612 --> 01:55.583
But the hospital
charged him... $154.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.152
This I.V. bag cost
less than a buck.

01:58.186 --> 02:02.156
But she was
charged $137.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.158
These are real prices, folks.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.459
Hold up.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.795
Wildly inflated
health care costs?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.464
This sounds like the work
of politicians to me.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.166
Was it Obamacare?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.834
Trump Aid,
McConnell Med?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.035
What did you do?!

02:15.068 --> 02:16.470
I'm not a politician.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.939
I'm just a boring
white guy.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.674
Why does this
keep happening?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.176
Sorry, Rachel,
but this time,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.044
it's not
the politicians' fault.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.046
The problem starts
with something called

02:26.079 --> 02:28.349
the "Chargemaster."

02:28.382 --> 02:32.386
The Chargemaster is a secret
document full of insane prices

02:32.420 --> 02:36.156
that hospitals use to charge
us whatever they want.

02:36.190 --> 02:39.360
Let's go on a trip through
the history of medical billing.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.028
Well, I'd rather not.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.701
(Adam)
A hundred years ago, hospital
pricing was pretty simple.

02:47.735 --> 02:49.370
We take the cost
of providing care

02:49.403 --> 02:51.205
and add a little on top
to make a profit.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.374
One amputation
costs us five bucks.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.143
So we'll charge you 6.50.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.878
But after the rise
of insurance companies,

02:57.911 --> 03:00.848
hospital billing got
complicated, in part because

03:00.881 --> 03:05.653
these gigantic corporations
demanded gigantic discounts.

03:05.686 --> 03:09.056
We send you thousands
of patients every day.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.425
So, we want... half off
all your prices.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.860
We can't afford that.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.095
So, to please these powerful
insurance companies,

03:15.128 --> 03:17.064
hospitals cooked up a plan.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.499
I've got it.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.734
We'll make up a really,
high fake price,

03:20.768 --> 03:22.503
and then give you
a discount off that.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.573
Hey, as long as I get to tell
my boss we got it cheaper.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.542
(laughter)

03:30.143 --> 03:32.112
(laughter)

03:32.145 --> 03:33.747
(Adam)
And in less than a century,

03:33.781 --> 03:37.418
health care prices went from
reasonable to nonsensical.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.354
Let's make one Tylenol $37.

03:40.388 --> 03:42.690
Three stitches, $2200.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.924
Ooh, here's a pitch.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.594
What if we made
rectal exams 69--

03:46.627 --> 03:49.096
Nah, that's too silly
even for me.

03:49.129 --> 03:53.601
**

03:53.634 --> 03:56.103
These crazily
inflated prices

03:56.136 --> 03:59.573
are kept in the hospital's
Chargemaster.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.041
(coughs)

04:01.074 --> 04:04.278
It's actually a computer file.
But the book is more dramatic.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.581
$7 for a single alcohol swab?
That's ridiculous.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.216
And true.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.118
Well, I only
pay my premium.

04:11.151 --> 04:14.755
If they wanna rip off my
insurance company with their
fake prices, what do I care?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.657
If you ever lose insurance,
you'll care.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.826
Because here's
the really evil part.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.461
If you don't
have insurance,

04:20.494 --> 04:23.731
you actually get charged
these fake prices.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.732
(studio audience
cheering and applauding)

04:24.765 --> 04:27.100
Let's see,
heart X-rays.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.470
That'll be $33,000.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.971
I can't afford that.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.840
No problem, we'll just
garnish your wages.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.309
Oh, bogus.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.945
Wait, they actually
charge people without insurance

04:37.978 --> 04:38.979
fake prices?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.649
Yeah.
That is terrible.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.451
Well, thankfully,
I have insurance,

04:43.484 --> 04:45.653
so the Chargemaster
doesn't affect me.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.588
Unfortunately,
it does.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.256
Even if you're insured,
you can get billed

04:49.289 --> 04:51.625
Chargemaster prices
if you go out-of-network.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.193
And anything can be
out-of-network.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.329
The hospital you go to,
the equipment used to treat you.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.697
Even the doctors you see.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.998
Arrow specialist.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.501
Out-of-network,
I am very expensive.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.503
Hospitals make
a ton of money

05:02.536 --> 05:04.372
overcharging
out-of-network patients.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.841
It's a real cash cow
and we all get milked.

05:07.875 --> 05:11.178
(cow mooing)
Worse, every hospital
has its own Chargemaster.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.881
A treatment that costs
7,000 at one hospital

05:13.914 --> 05:15.783
could cost a hundred grand
down the road.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.819
And you can't comparison shop
when you're dying.

05:18.852 --> 05:19.820
Which hospital
do you want?

05:19.853 --> 05:20.788
Money Bags Medical

05:20.821 --> 05:23.957
or St. Vincent's
Discount Sick House?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.526
Money Bags it is.

05:25.559 --> 05:29.663
Plus, since your insurance
company faces inflated costs,

05:29.697 --> 05:32.966
That can trickle down to you in
the form of... higher premiums.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.702
Oh, surprisingly painless.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.870
Wait till
you get the bill.
(cow mooing)

05:36.904 --> 05:38.639
How do they
get away with this?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.709
Simple, the health care industry
spends more on lobbying

05:41.742 --> 05:44.378
than the oil and defense
industries combined.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.380
(cash register rings)

05:46.414 --> 05:48.982
(men babbling)

05:49.016 --> 05:50.183
Thanks, Doc.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.852
I'll take care
of you real nice.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.722
Say, does this
cyst look normal?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.156
Oh, God.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.491
So, how can I stop it?

05:57.525 --> 05:58.492
What do I do?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.160
Honestly, nothing.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.229
We need to go
to the hospital,

06:02.262 --> 06:04.932
so they have no incentive
to change how they do business.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.067
And politicians have spent
decades arguing

06:07.100 --> 06:09.069
over how to pay the bill

06:09.102 --> 06:11.839
instead of asking why
the bill is so high?

06:11.872 --> 06:14.775
Until they do, we're
stuck with this system.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.078
God, what if I get fired
and lose my insurance?

06:18.111 --> 06:20.113
I would be ruined!

06:20.147 --> 06:22.015
I feel so anxious.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.584
(woman over PA)
Rachel, the doctor
will see you now.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.419
Down the hall
and to your left.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.955
Well, then,
if I'm gonna get ripped off,

06:27.988 --> 06:30.090
I might as well score
some antibiotics.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.291
I wanna be done
with this cold,

06:31.324 --> 06:33.861
and those miracle drugs are
worth whatever they cost.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.897
Even if it means the end
of modern medicine?

06:36.930 --> 06:39.032
You are the worst person
I have ever met,

06:39.066 --> 06:41.969
and I work in finance.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.070
Harsh.

06:46.474 --> 06:49.610
(woman over PA)
Paging Dr. Dingbat to the O.R.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.645
Oh, I thought
I'd lost you.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.047
I don't wanna hear you
bad-mouthing antibiotics.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.783
I have a cold
and they're gonna cure me.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.284
No, they won't.

06:57.317 --> 07:00.087
Colds are caused by viruses,
not bacteria.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.255
So, antibiotics
won't help them.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.792
But more importantly,
our misuse of antibiotics

07:04.825 --> 07:07.294
could mean the end
of modern medicine.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.596
I find that
hard to believe.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.130
I'll walk you through it.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.432
Before antibiotics,
if you got an infection,

07:12.466 --> 07:14.602
there was a high chance
you'd die of it.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.636
He's right!

07:15.669 --> 07:17.104
This guy stepped
on a nail.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.171
Good change he'll die.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.007
This woman
had minor surgery.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.742
Great chance she'll die.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.645
All of these people
will probably die!

07:24.678 --> 07:27.481
Being a doctor
in the past is fun.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.850
But all that
changed in 1928

07:29.883 --> 07:33.487
when one scientist
got super lucky.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.188
One weekend,
Alexander Fleming

07:35.222 --> 07:38.158
accidentally left out a Petri
dish filled with bacteria.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.260
And when he returned,
he found that the bacteria

07:40.293 --> 07:42.362
had been destroyed by mold.

07:42.395 --> 07:46.333
This led to the discovery of the
first antibiotic, penicillin.

07:46.366 --> 07:50.538
It saved countless lives and
earned Fleming the Nobel Prize.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.805
What's the issue then?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.173
Seems like
everything is great.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.442
For a few decades,
it was.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.178
Until the rise
of resistant bacteria.

07:58.211 --> 07:59.880
When you take antibiotics,
you're trying to kill

07:59.913 --> 08:03.016
all the bad bacteria
in your system.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.653
But sometimes, like if you
don't finish your antibiotics,

08:05.686 --> 08:07.521
or just through
random chance,

08:07.555 --> 08:11.058
a few of these bio bullies
develop resistance.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.826
(screams)
(whimpers)

08:12.860 --> 08:14.027
(surprised)
I'm okay.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.529
(defiantly)
I'm okay.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.497
I'm resistant!

08:17.531 --> 08:20.801
Once that happens,
resistance can spread.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.369
(Adam)
First to other bacteria...

08:22.402 --> 08:23.537
Mwah!
Mwah!

08:23.571 --> 08:25.172
... then to other people.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.541
(bacteria)
Mwah!
Over time, these protected
pathogens

08:27.575 --> 08:30.510
can propagate
all over the planet.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.915
And when that happens,
the antibiotic becomes useless.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.550
Once you start using a new
antibiotic,

08:36.584 --> 08:40.020
it's only a matter of time
before resistance develops.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.389
Penicillin was
a miracle drug.

08:42.422 --> 08:45.893
But bacteria became resistant
to it in just a few years.

08:45.926 --> 08:49.496
But there are other
antibiotics, right?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.764
Please say yes.

08:50.798 --> 08:53.734
Yes, but the same thing
is happening to them, too.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.335
And we're speeding
that process up

08:55.368 --> 08:59.239
because antibiotics
are insanely over-prescribed.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.075
Even though they have
no effect on colds and flus,

09:02.109 --> 09:04.111
doctors hand out
antibiotics to patients

09:04.144 --> 09:05.746
just because they ask.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.047
I got a cold, Doc!

09:07.080 --> 09:08.849
Give me some of those
sweet, sweet pills.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.584
Oh, it won't help,
but sure.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.920
Some anti-B's
for my anti bae.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.055
(laughing)

09:15.088 --> 09:16.389
According to the CDC,

09:16.423 --> 09:18.592
at least one-third
of antibiotics

09:18.626 --> 09:20.961
are unnecessarily
prescribed.

09:20.994 --> 09:25.232
And 80% of these precious drugs
aren't even used for medicine.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.400
They're given
to farm animals.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.871
(chicken squawks)
Mother Falcon,
come on!

09:30.904 --> 09:32.439
Because of all
this overuse,

09:32.472 --> 09:36.777
our supply of effective
antibiotics is dwindling.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.780
Then we need to invent
more and fast!

09:39.813 --> 09:41.949
Uh, that won't be easy.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.952
Rachel, this is
Dr. Arjun Srinivasan.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.888
An expert on antibiotic
resistance at the CDC.

09:47.921 --> 09:51.158
Rachel, antibiotics are really
tricky to develop.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.893
So, it takes a long time.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.962
In fact, we haven't
had a totally new class

09:54.995 --> 09:57.064
of antibiotics
since the late 80s.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.733
What have you scientists
been doing all this time?

09:59.767 --> 10:01.101
Well, we're trying,
but it's also hard

10:01.134 --> 10:02.936
to convince pharmaceutical
companies to make

10:02.970 --> 10:05.739
new antibiotics because they
don't make a lot of money.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.175
Yeah, they just,
uh, save lives.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.243
Right, we need to encourage
these companies

10:10.277 --> 10:12.479
to make these
lifesaving drugs.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.648
And in the meantime,
we need to start using

10:14.682 --> 10:17.818
the ones that we have
like a precious resource.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.921
We are dangerously close
to the end of antibiotics.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.190
Um, what happens then?

10:23.223 --> 10:24.491
I'll show you.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.993
Thanks, Doctor.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.861
No, Adam, wait for me!

10:27.895 --> 10:29.096
(mechanical whirring)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.330
(grunts, electrical shorting)

10:30.363 --> 10:32.766
If antibiotic resistance
becomes the norm,

10:32.800 --> 10:35.435
infections will come back
in full force.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.871
And we'll lose the ability
to safely perform

10:37.905 --> 10:39.673
organ transplants,
chemotherapy,

10:39.707 --> 10:43.343
and even routine surgeries.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.013
All of modern medicine
is built on a foundation

10:46.046 --> 10:47.815
of effective antibiotics.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.217
If we lose them,
we lose everything.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.686
The bad old days
will be back again.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.521
(maniacal laughter)

10:54.554 --> 10:57.691
No! No! We cannot go
back to the Dark Ages.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.693
We need to conserve
our antibiotics.

10:59.727 --> 11:03.030
Hey, you still want a taste
of these anti-B's, baby!

11:03.063 --> 11:06.199
Got the newest ones
in my pocket.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.969
Listen, lady, just because
I can be pushy when I'm sick,

11:09.002 --> 11:10.637
doesn't mean you should
just give me what I want!

11:10.670 --> 11:13.206
I'm sorry,
the patients are so mean,

11:13.240 --> 11:15.642
and it makes them happy
when I give them pills.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.011
(crying)

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
(loud sneeze)

11:19.412 --> 11:22.215
Gesundheit.
Oh, I still
feel like crap.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.283
(sniffles)

11:24.451 --> 11:26.086
That's it.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.988
I'll get a mammogram.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.189
It won't cure my cold,

11:29.222 --> 11:30.924
but it will tell me
I don't have cancer

11:30.958 --> 11:34.327
so at least I will have beaten
one disease today.

11:34.361 --> 11:38.065
You can't possibly have anything
to say about mammograms, Adam.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.733
Actually...
Nope.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.170
I'm not listening
to you talk about boobs.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.605
Yeah, I can see how
this one's gonna be tricky.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.379
**

11:52.412 --> 11:54.848
Stupid Adam thinks
he's so smart.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.017
Well, not this time.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.118
I didn't get
the care I wanted

11:58.151 --> 11:59.552
because it would
have bankrupt me.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.954
I didn't get antibiotics

12:00.988 --> 12:03.090
because it would end
medicine as we know it.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.093
But a mammogram
is a no-brainer.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.394
(knock on door)

12:07.427 --> 12:08.595
Hi.
Hi.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.430
I'm Dr. Elmore.
I'm Rachel.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.932
Nice to meet you.
How can I help you today.

12:11.965 --> 12:14.968
I don't wanna seem pushy,
but I need a mammogram, now.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.537
Can you tell me a little bit
more about why?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.806
I haven't found
a lump or anything.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.809
I just need to get screened
so I know I don't have cancer.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.144
Okay, let me sit down
and let's talk about this.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.614
Cancer screening
is a complicated topic.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.216
I looked at your medical record
before I came in

12:29.249 --> 12:31.251
and it says that
you're 35 years old.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.286
You don't have any family
history of breast cancer.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.255
No risk factors, correct?

12:35.288 --> 12:37.958
Then I would not recommend
a screening mammogram today.

12:37.991 --> 12:39.993
Why on earth not?

12:40.027 --> 12:43.130
Breast cancer is something
that many of us fear.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.899
Many of us have loved ones
who have suffered from it.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.069
But the truth about screening
mammograms is that

12:49.102 --> 12:51.504
the benefit is less
than we had hoped,

12:51.538 --> 12:55.008
and there are real harms,
more than people think.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.577
You sound like that human
internet comment.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.946
Oh, you must mean Adam.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.314
We were just talking with Adam
about this at book club.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.184
(Adam, through door)
Dr. Elmore, is that you?
How's the family?

13:04.217 --> 13:07.320
Fine, Adam!
You can come in.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.089
I'm not looking,
very respectful.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.090
(chuckling)

13:10.123 --> 13:11.825
Rachel, this is Joann Elmore.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.127
She's a doctor, professor
at University of Washington

13:14.161 --> 13:16.596
and an expert on breast
cancer screenings.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.999
Adam, I'm over here.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.000
(loud gasp)

13:20.033 --> 13:21.368
I don't understand.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.504
I thought every woman needed
screenings like constantly.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.007
Yeah, that's what doctors
and advocacy groups

13:27.040 --> 13:28.641
have told us for decades.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.878
In the 80s,
the American Cancer Society

13:30.911 --> 13:33.813
even ran an ad that said
"If you haven't had a mammogram,

13:33.847 --> 13:36.449
you need more than
your breasts examined."

13:36.483 --> 13:38.151
Wow, that's insulting.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.854
Heh, par for the course
for the 80s.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.723
But in the last few years,
new research has caused

13:43.756 --> 13:45.725
some of the recommendations
to change.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.360
The American Cancer Society,

13:47.394 --> 13:49.296
the US Preventative Services
Task Force

13:49.329 --> 13:52.065
and the American
College of Physicians
have all recommended

13:52.099 --> 13:54.067
getting mammogram
screenings
less frequently

13:54.101 --> 13:55.502
and beginning them
later in life.

13:55.535 --> 13:56.870
Ow!

13:56.904 --> 13:58.405
Really?
Why?

13:58.438 --> 14:01.174
While screening mammograms
can and do save lives,

14:01.208 --> 14:03.376
the actual number
of lives saved,

14:03.410 --> 14:06.213
it's much smaller
than most people think.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.081
Based on randomized
clinical trials,

14:08.115 --> 14:10.417
if you took 10,000
women in their 40s,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.085
here's how many might
die of breast cancer

14:12.119 --> 14:15.555
if they didn't get any
mammograms for a decade.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.824
And here's how many of those
same women might die

14:17.857 --> 14:20.360
if they did get
those mammogram screenings.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.029
Take off your blindfold.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.230
They both
look the same.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.731
Exactly.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.566
There was no statistically
significant difference

14:26.599 --> 14:28.268
between the women
who got the mammograms

14:28.301 --> 14:29.536
and the control group.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.271
How can that be?

14:31.304 --> 14:33.773
Mammograms find cancer.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.742
I have many pamphlets
that say that.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.911
Well, the definitely
find cancer,

14:37.945 --> 14:40.213
but not all cancer
is the same.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.015
How do you think
cancer works?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.251
Well, it starts
with one bad cell.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.885
It multiplies and spreads

14:45.919 --> 14:48.755
and if you catch it early
enough, then you survive.

14:48.788 --> 14:50.590
And if you don't,
then your friends and family

14:50.623 --> 14:51.758
run a 5K every year.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.226
That's what a lot
of people think.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.628
But the truth
is a lot more complicated.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.967
Some cancer grows
so fast that mammograms

15:00.000 --> 15:01.601
can't catch it in time.

15:01.634 --> 15:04.104
This is an awful thing to win!

15:04.137 --> 15:05.738
(Adam)
But some cancers start growing,

15:05.772 --> 15:08.308
but then stop
before they kill you.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.777
And other cancers
grow so slowly,

15:10.810 --> 15:14.114
they would never
have the chance to kill you.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.383
Finally, there's the kind of
cancer you were thinking of.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.285
The kind you hope
to catch early.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.787
Yeah, that one hasn't reached
the finish line yet.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.290
A mammogram could
stop it in time.
It might.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.757
(beep)

15:24.791 --> 15:27.760
The problem is mammograms
can't tell the difference

15:27.794 --> 15:29.829
between these
types of cancer.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.398
Oh, I can't
tell you apart.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.166
You all look deadly
to me.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.968
I'm gonna treat
you all the same.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.705
You're so sexy
when you detect cancer.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.976
That is less helpful
than I thought.

15:43.010 --> 15:46.146
But if there's even a tiny
chance it'll save my life,

15:46.179 --> 15:48.315
it does seem worth it
for a harmless test.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.817
Unfortunately, mammograms
aren't harmless.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.989
(Joann)
There's a chance the x-ray will
show something suspicious

15:56.023 --> 15:57.991
when the woman
doesn't even have cancer.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.160
That's called a false positive.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.262
This happens to about
one out of ten women,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.097
and it can be very stressful.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.665
And the more often
you get mammograms,

16:05.698 --> 16:08.435
the more likely you are
to get a false positive.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.704
Over half of women
in the US who receive
annual mammograms

16:11.738 --> 16:15.042
will experience
a false positive
within a decade.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.745
(Rachel)
But, okay, sometimes
they do find cancer, right?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.684
The screening could
just find one of those
harmless cancers

16:24.717 --> 16:26.386
that would never
kill you.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.688
(Joann)
That's what we call
over diagnosis.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.623
Estimates are that about
one in five cancers

16:30.657 --> 16:32.225
mi be overdiagnosed.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.860
(Rachel)
That's really high.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.362
(Adam)
Consider the emotional

16:35.395 --> 16:36.729
and psychological stress

16:36.763 --> 16:39.166
of thinking you
have a deadly disease

16:39.199 --> 16:40.367
when you don't.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.469
Or having to tell
your loved ones.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.371
Those are real harms.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.474
(Joann)
And over diagnosis
can lead to overtreatment.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.043
Since mammograms can't tell the
difference between these types

16:50.077 --> 16:53.480
of cancers, we recommend serious
treatments for all of them.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.915
And that can result
in women getting treatments

16:55.948 --> 16:57.184
they don't need.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.685
(Adam)
Some, like, chemotherapy,

16:58.718 --> 17:00.887
radiation therapy,
and mastectomy

17:00.920 --> 17:03.390
take a serious toll
on the body.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.059
(Rachel)
So, you're telling me I could
have that lazy cancer

17:06.093 --> 17:09.396
that would never have hurt me,
but still be told to get chemo?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.331
(Adam)
Yeah, it's entirely possible.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.566
(Rachel)
Holy crow.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.603
Taken together, given the
false positives, overdiagnosis,

17:16.636 --> 17:20.240
overtreatment, instead of
rushing in to get screening,

17:20.273 --> 17:22.742
I want women to weigh
all of the data

17:22.775 --> 17:25.278
and make
an informed choice.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.713
Prostate and thyroid
cancer screenings

17:26.746 --> 17:28.047
have the same issue,
by the way.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.549
You know, I used to get
my prostate checked

17:29.582 --> 17:32.252
twice a week
before I found this out.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.187
So, what should I do?

17:34.221 --> 17:36.423
If you do feel a lump
or an abnormality,

17:36.456 --> 17:37.757
please go see
your doctor.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.760
And if they recommend
a mammogram,
get one at that time.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.263
Apart from that,
the US Preventative
Services Task Force

17:43.296 --> 17:45.265
recommends talking to your
doctor in your 40s about

17:45.298 --> 17:47.066
whether you wanna start
screenings then.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.802
And otherwise, they suggest
getting them every two years

17:49.836 --> 17:51.438
starting in your 50s.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.374
That's when the benefit
is more and the harms are less.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.044
I guess I, I won't
get one today then.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.446
There is some good news.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.148
Our treatment
of breast cancer

18:01.181 --> 18:03.216
is so much better
than it used to be.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.952
The mortality has dropped
significantly.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.987
And we're able to cure most
women with breast cancer

18:08.020 --> 18:10.790
regardless of whether
the cancer was detected

18:10.823 --> 18:12.925
on a screening exam or not.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.962
Thanks, Dr. Elmore.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.464
See you at book club.
I'll bring my usual.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.832
Baloney dip
and opinions.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.469
(man coughing)

18:22.502 --> 18:25.205
Rachel...
Are you upset?

18:26.439 --> 18:28.241
Yes.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.643
I came here because
I wanted to feel better.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.280
But now I know that the hospital
will bankrupt me,

18:33.313 --> 18:35.081
antibiotics will
end the world,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.484
and I won't get a mammogram
until I am 50.

18:37.517 --> 18:42.155
If doctors and hospitals
won't make me feel better,

18:42.189 --> 18:43.523
maybe nothing will.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.261
(woman over PA)
Paging Adam Conover
for the positive takeaway.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
On it, stat!

18:50.330 --> 18:51.498
Also your bike's
been towed.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.699
Oh, man!

18:55.034 --> 18:58.205
**

18:58.238 --> 19:00.640
Hey, guys, I'm here on the set
of "Adam Ruins Everything"

19:00.673 --> 19:01.941
with Dr. Joann Elmore.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.043
We got more questions
about mammograms for her.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.812
Um, you make
this distinction, though,

19:05.845 --> 19:08.815
between screening mammograms
and diagnostic mammograms.

19:08.848 --> 19:12.685
Can you explain that to me?
That's an important point
in that screening exams

19:12.719 --> 19:15.355
are when the women has no
symptoms, she's healthy.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.057
And the goal is to try
and detect cancer early

19:18.090 --> 19:20.560
when we can offer
easier treatments

19:20.593 --> 19:21.561
and hopefully
save lives.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.895
That's the checkup version.
Right.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.564
And diagnostic mammograms,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.799
I obtain them when women
come in and they have a lump

19:26.833 --> 19:28.468
or a suspicious
abnormality.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.537
And then we get
a diagnostic mammogram.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.839
The research that
you've done about the,

19:32.872 --> 19:34.341
the rate of false positives
and etcetera,

19:34.374 --> 19:36.376
that's all based around
screening mammograms.
That's right.

19:36.409 --> 19:37.877
And tell me a little bit more
about that research.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.247
Well, I did it because
I had a lot of women

19:40.280 --> 19:41.748
calling me up anxious.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.883
They were getting this letter
that said Dear Mrs. Smith,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.552
don't worry,
but you had an abnormality

19:45.585 --> 19:47.720
on your breast mammogram.

19:47.754 --> 19:51.057
And, uh, so we just quantified
how often that happens.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.192
And what your audience
should know

19:53.226 --> 19:56.729
is that this happens
very frequently
in the United States.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.898
One out of ten women
that go get a mammogram

19:58.931 --> 20:01.401
will be asked to come back
for additional testing.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.570
And so, I hope if women
know that that's just part

20:03.603 --> 20:07.507
of the screening test,
that they hopefully
won't be as nervous.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.243
It's kind of like how
you set your smoke detectors.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.612
You know, at what level
do you want them to go off?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.681
We don't wanna
miss cancer.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.749
But we may have it
a little bit--

20:16.783 --> 20:17.750
Yes, when you're cooking,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.018
if your smoke detector's
too sensitive

20:19.051 --> 20:21.020
and every time you cook
anything... beep, beep, beep...

20:21.053 --> 20:22.422
You gotta get up
on the chair.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.891
And that's okay if it's
just an annoying noise,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.193
but if it's talking about your
body and it's very frightening

20:27.226 --> 20:30.062
and stressful,
you don't want that false--

20:30.096 --> 20:31.598
that false alarm actually
has real harms.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.232
It's a fine balance.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.801
As a doctor,
what are the misconceptions

20:34.834 --> 20:38.438
that people come in with
about breast cancer.
That's a good question.

20:38.471 --> 20:41.774
Probably one of the biggest
is this underlying fear

20:41.808 --> 20:43.410
and anxiety about
breast cancer.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.779
Women think
it is more common

20:46.813 --> 20:48.147
than it actually is.
Really?

20:48.180 --> 20:51.250
Women hear this one in eight
women with breast cancer.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.885
And it's actually a statistic

20:52.919 --> 20:55.988
that is one in eight
in a lifetime

20:56.022 --> 20:57.557
and it's of a diagnosis,
not of death.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.258
I see, that's the problem
with statistics

20:59.292 --> 21:00.760
is that they
can play into,

21:00.793 --> 21:01.761
if they're not just
framed just right,

21:01.794 --> 21:02.762
they can play into the...

21:02.795 --> 21:04.564
Right.
... more fearful parts.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.098
Right, I'll have a 20-year-old
come into clinic.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.568
And they'll be all worried
about breast cancer.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.903
And they wonder why they
shouldn't get screening
mammograms.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.973
And I'll tell them, you know,
your chance as a 20-year-old

21:14.006 --> 21:16.343
of getting breast cancer
in the next five years,

21:16.376 --> 21:17.910
it's the same
as a 70-year-old man.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.479
Really? (laughing)

21:19.512 --> 21:20.647
Well, and then they say,
what, you don't get

21:20.680 --> 21:22.081
mammograms on 70-year-olds.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.283
And I kind of say, yeah,
that's why we're not
recommending it

21:24.317 --> 21:26.285
in 20-year-old women.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.320
And 70-year-old man,
there's a small chance

21:27.354 --> 21:28.355
they'll get
breast cancer.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.922
Oh, yes, one...

21:29.956 --> 21:31.591
A small, small percentage
of breast cancers

21:31.624 --> 21:32.592
actually occur in men.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.593
I actually
didn't know that.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.861
That's really
interesting.
Yeah.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.830
Why do you think there is
this sort of emphasis or, uh,

21:37.864 --> 21:39.332
reliance on mammograms.

21:39.366 --> 21:41.334
Everybody thinks, okay,
what's the number one thing

21:41.368 --> 21:42.369
I should do to
fight breast cancer.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.503
Go get a mammogram
right now.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.537
That's sort of
our first thought.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.005
Wish I had
an easy answer.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.707
I think it's complicated.
Yeah.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.209
You know, just the whole
history of the breast
and culture

21:50.242 --> 21:52.311
and in politics
and in the media.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.814
And there's
the heightened fear.

21:54.847 --> 21:58.518
I think that we also have
oversold medical technology.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.553
I hate to say that
as a doctor.
Mm-hmm.

22:00.587 --> 22:04.357
Um, because I'm a physician
and I care about medical care.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.193
But, um, no medical
test is perfect.

22:07.226 --> 22:10.029
Hmm.
So, I wanna educate women
about the pros and cons

22:10.062 --> 22:12.331
and part of the good news
is that our treatments

22:12.365 --> 22:14.467
are so much better
than they used to be.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.669
And we can save
a lot of lives now

22:16.703 --> 22:18.204
that we weren't
able to in the past.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.906
Well, thank you so much
for coming on the show

22:19.939 --> 22:20.907
to talk to us about it.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.241
I really appreciate it.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.242
My pleasure.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.647
(sirens wailing)

22:27.680 --> 22:31.418
Hey, I didn't mean to make
your sick day any harder.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.721
I was just
trying to help.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.989
You need to understand
something.

22:37.023 --> 22:41.193
I am not crazy for worrying
about getting sick.

22:41.227 --> 22:44.363
People do get sick
and people do die.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.898
And coming here used
to make me feel like

22:45.932 --> 22:48.568
I had some control
over that.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.902
I know.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.738
I didn't really need
all those treatments and tests

22:51.771 --> 22:54.507
for my stupid cold.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.443
Just made me
feel better.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.246
'Cause I'm afraid
of doing too little.

23:00.279 --> 23:04.083
I know, but often
doing too much can be worse.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.186
It can bankrupt you
or deplete lifesaving drugs.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.622
Or even hurt your health.

23:09.656 --> 23:12.425
If you're actually sick,
please go to the doctor.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.927
But going out
of anxiety or fear...

23:14.961 --> 23:16.429
That's not a good thing.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.130
I know.

23:18.164 --> 23:20.467
I just don't know how
to relax about this stuff.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.801
None of us do.

23:21.834 --> 23:25.605
In the United States, we undergo
100 million CT and MRI scans

23:25.638 --> 23:29.075
a year and almost
ten billion lab tests.

23:29.108 --> 23:34.213
We're overtreating ourselves to
the tune of $226 billion a year.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.450
We pay more per person in health
care than any other country,

23:37.484 --> 23:39.719
and we're not
any healthier for it.

23:39.752 --> 23:44.924
And maybe part of fixing that
is worrying less and doing less.

23:44.957 --> 23:47.794
(chuckling)

23:47.827 --> 23:49.962
That's kind of liberating
when you think about it.

23:49.996 --> 23:50.963
**

23:50.997 --> 23:52.465
Less is more.

23:52.499 --> 23:56.235
Yeah, and the best part is,
you can still have a lollipop.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.837
Cherry.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.739
Wow.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.173
You're right.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.075
Thanks, Adam.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.912
You know, you're not
such a bad guy after...

24:05.945 --> 24:07.480
(loud sneeze,
music stops abruptly)

24:07.514 --> 24:09.816
Oh! Sorry.

24:09.849 --> 24:13.352
Do you want some tissue
or some hand sanitizer.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.922
Oh, you know, a lot of people
say hand sanitizer is bad.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.924
But the evidence
is totally out on that.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.160
If you have an extra seven
minutes, I could--

24:21.193 --> 24:23.062
Oh, wow, she is
really booking it.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.466
Derek, we have
to end this.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.001
What?
Why?

24:29.035 --> 24:30.970
Because my husband's
coming out of his coma.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.839
And you're about
to go into one.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.006
Kiss me.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.775
Kiss me like you did
for the first time

24:35.808 --> 24:37.343
after you came
out of your coma.
