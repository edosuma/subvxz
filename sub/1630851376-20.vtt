[upbeat music]

00:03.553 --> 00:06.096
- Tom's agent had sent
his book out to publishers,

00:06.196 --> 00:07.937
and while she tried
to drum up offers,

00:08.037 --> 00:09.379
all he could do
was wait for news.

00:09.479 --> 00:11.100
[phone buzzes]
Patiently.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.022
[mug shatters]

00:13.122 --> 00:16.506
Sorry, wasn't my agent,
but good news:

00:16.606 --> 00:18.107
my socks finally shipped.

00:18.207 --> 00:19.749
[phone buzzes]

00:19.849 --> 00:21.270
[lamp shatters]
- [speaking Spanish]

00:21.370 --> 00:22.912
- Sorry.

00:23.012 --> 00:24.794
There's a 40% chance of rain
in the Bay Area tomorrow.

00:24.894 --> 00:26.315
- [groans]

00:26.415 --> 00:28.878
- The worst part was that,
with his novel done,

00:28.978 --> 00:31.280
the only writing he was doing
was in a recycled journal

00:31.380 --> 00:32.721
that his sister bought him.

00:32.821 --> 00:34.723
I can't do this.
It's degrading.

00:34.823 --> 00:36.645
- Hey, you chose
to be a writer.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.168
- No, I'm saying
literally, it's...

00:39.268 --> 00:41.270
look, it's degrading.

00:43.512 --> 00:45.294
- Still haven't heard anything?
How are you holding up?

00:45.394 --> 00:46.855
- You know Tom.
He's a rock.

00:46.955 --> 00:48.337
- Whoa, hang on.

00:48.437 --> 00:49.658
This is it!
- Oh!

00:49.758 --> 00:51.139
- Whoa.
- [sighs]

00:51.239 --> 00:53.061
We've lost a lot
of good mugs this week.

00:53.161 --> 00:54.142
- False alarm.

00:54.242 --> 00:55.704
I could've sworn
I felt it vibrate.

00:55.804 --> 00:56.825
- Sarah's has been
the same way.

00:56.925 --> 00:58.186
She hasn't gotten any sleep.

00:58.286 --> 01:00.228
She's nervous about
the musical tonight.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.510
- I wouldn't say "nervous."
- Really? You're not nervous?

01:02.610 --> 01:03.752
- Oh, no, I am.
I just wouldn't say it.

01:03.852 --> 01:05.593
It makes it worse.
- Oh, sorry.

01:05.693 --> 01:08.837
- It's just, I want everyone
to love "Unsung Sheroes:

01:08.937 --> 01:10.838
"A Musical Celebration
of Groundbreaking Women

01:10.938 --> 01:12.320
from Sacagawea to Sotomayor."

01:12.420 --> 01:13.441
- Did the title get longer?

01:13.541 --> 01:14.762
- It did, and so did the show.

01:14.862 --> 01:17.205
- And I was not involved
with the rewrites.

01:17.305 --> 01:18.966
- Hey, there's nothing
to be nervous about, okay?

01:19.066 --> 01:20.848
If anything goes wrong,
I already taught Gretchen

01:20.948 --> 01:22.250
some sweet breakdance moves.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.171
- You didn't really do that,
did you?

01:24.271 --> 01:25.893
Gretchen?

01:25.993 --> 01:27.174
Gretchen, honey!

01:27.274 --> 01:29.457
- My boss has been making me
work so late,

01:29.557 --> 01:31.378
I'm looking forward
to a three-hour show.

01:31.478 --> 01:32.740
I can catch up on some sleep.

01:32.840 --> 01:35.102
- It's actually 3 1/2 hours.
- Yes.

01:35.202 --> 01:36.864
- Well, if you sleep
through Gretchen's performance,

01:36.964 --> 01:38.706
Emily has them recording it,
so just let me know.

01:38.806 --> 01:40.107
I'll shoot you the link.
- Oh, yeah.

01:40.207 --> 01:43.470
'Cause she's in Paris
with her new boy...mm-mm.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.752
- Boy...mm-mm?
- Boyfriend.

01:45.852 --> 01:47.274
Yeah, it's okay.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.357
Ex-wives are allowed
to have boyfriends.

01:50.457 --> 01:53.039
Because JoJo's gone
and I'm all alone

01:53.139 --> 01:55.001
and not in Paris
with my boyfriend

01:55.101 --> 01:57.644
doesn't mean I'm sad
or resentful

01:57.744 --> 02:00.687
or upset or anything like that.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.409
Haven't been getting
much sleep, though.

02:02.509 --> 02:04.290
- Must be a Hayworth thing.
- They're a fragile people.

02:04.390 --> 02:05.492
[phone buzzes]
- Oh, here we go.

02:05.592 --> 02:06.933
This is it.
Hello?

02:07.033 --> 02:08.254
Yep.
[chuckles]

02:08.354 --> 02:09.976
Okay.

02:10.076 --> 02:11.618
This is actually your phone.
- Oh.

02:11.718 --> 02:13.840
- ♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

02:15.681 --> 02:18.825
[upbeat music]

02:18.925 --> 02:20.346
- Okay, have fun
with your cousins, okay?

02:20.446 --> 02:21.948
Pórtate bien.
- Sí, voy.

02:22.048 --> 02:23.749
- Lupe, thank you so much
for watching the kids.

02:23.849 --> 02:25.871
Camila's so excited
about the show

02:25.971 --> 02:27.673
and the sleepover.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.115
- Yes, me too.

02:29.215 --> 02:31.036
Christmas came early.
- Great.

02:31.136 --> 02:33.439
- Hmm.
Vamos. Andale.

02:33.539 --> 02:37.923
- So we're free to make
this night a little more...fun.

02:38.023 --> 02:40.285
- Uh-huh.
- Tom, enough with the phone.

02:40.385 --> 02:42.488
- Sorry, it's just,
you know, the book.

02:42.588 --> 02:44.049
- Yeah, it's done.
You worked hard.

02:44.149 --> 02:46.772
You wrote something great.
So now you deserve to relax.

02:46.872 --> 02:49.014
We deserve to relax.

02:49.114 --> 02:52.497
So...I got us these.

02:52.597 --> 02:53.939
- Um, we're not allowed

02:54.039 --> 02:55.540
to bring outside food
into the theatre.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.421
- They're pot gummies.

02:56.521 --> 02:58.063
- They're...pot?

02:58.163 --> 02:59.664
- Relax, narc.
It's legal now.

02:59.764 --> 03:00.705
- On a state level,

03:00.805 --> 03:02.587
but federally,
it's a mixed bag.

03:02.687 --> 03:03.908
I'm so--I'm just surprised.

03:04.008 --> 03:05.470
I mean, it's been forever
since we've done--

03:05.570 --> 03:06.551
where'd you even get it?

03:06.651 --> 03:08.032
- One of the mums
in play group.

03:08.132 --> 03:09.674
- Eliza?
- Obviously.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.796
Come on, it'll get your mind
off of the book

03:11.896 --> 03:13.398
and my mind off of wanting
to strangle you

03:13.498 --> 03:14.218
when you talk about the book.

03:14.298 --> 03:16.120
- [chuckles]

03:16.220 --> 03:18.322
A'ight, I'll do it.
- [chuckles]

03:18.422 --> 03:19.844
- I'm doing it.

03:19.944 --> 03:22.206
I'm doing it.

03:22.306 --> 03:23.527
Nah, I'm not doing it.

03:23.627 --> 03:24.809
I want to stay sharp
in case my agent calls.

03:24.909 --> 03:26.370
What if there's
a time-sensitive

03:26.470 --> 03:27.451
Saturday night book offer--

03:27.551 --> 03:28.532
- Yeah, sorry, I can't do this.

03:28.632 --> 03:30.634
I'll see you on the other side.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.379
- Tonight's gonna fly by, huh?

03:35.479 --> 03:37.021
- It's supposed to be
really long.

03:37.121 --> 03:38.382
- Yeah, that was a joke.

03:38.482 --> 03:40.824
- Mm, sorry.
I'm just kind of out of it,

03:40.924 --> 03:43.026
you know, being
the only single guy

03:43.126 --> 03:45.148
at one of these things.

03:45.248 --> 03:46.430
I didn't want to say anything,

03:46.530 --> 03:49.112
but I've been feeling
kind of down lately.

03:49.212 --> 03:51.114
- You've been hiding it well.
- Thank you.

03:51.214 --> 03:53.637
- That was also a joke.
Is my timing off today?

03:53.737 --> 03:55.559
- I mean, I'm happy
that Emily's moving on.

03:55.659 --> 03:57.000
I am. I'm happy for her.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.521
That's great. That's so great.
- Yeah.

03:58.621 --> 03:59.883
- And, you know,
when I was with JoJo,

03:59.983 --> 04:01.404
it felt like
I was moving on too.

04:01.504 --> 04:02.445
- Yeah, it seemed like
you and JoJo

04:02.545 --> 04:03.526
were meant for each other.

04:03.626 --> 04:05.088
- Mm, that was a joke.

04:05.188 --> 04:07.690
- It was.
She's back!

04:07.790 --> 04:10.693
- Yeah, tonight, I'm just
gonna focus on Gretchen

04:10.793 --> 04:12.815
and not think
about relationships.

04:12.915 --> 04:14.137
- There he is.

04:14.237 --> 04:17.019
Windmount's
most eligible bachelor.

04:17.119 --> 04:19.542
The ladies and I were
looking for you all over.

04:19.642 --> 04:20.623
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

04:20.723 --> 04:22.305
Well, you found me.

04:22.405 --> 04:23.786
Denise, this is Margot.

04:23.886 --> 04:25.107
- We were just talking
about how crazy it is

04:25.207 --> 04:26.869
that this guy is still single.

04:26.969 --> 04:28.911
- Really?
That's what you all talk about?

04:29.011 --> 04:31.153
- Yes. Connor,
I'm gonna make it my mission

04:31.253 --> 04:32.394
to set you up with someone.

04:32.494 --> 04:33.716
- Oh, please don't.
- Oh.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.878
- I'm gonna go find Sarah.
- Please don't.

04:35.978 --> 04:37.139
- You know who's going
through an ugly divorce?

04:37.219 --> 04:38.400
- Mm?
- Linda Keebler.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.642
- Oh.

04:40.742 --> 04:43.525
Sorry. So sorry.

04:43.625 --> 04:46.448
- Ten minutes to places, guys.

04:46.548 --> 04:48.570
- I'm a lady and a pilot,

04:48.670 --> 04:50.972
but don't call me
a lady pilot, buster.

04:51.072 --> 04:53.695
- Ooh, sounds good, Gretchen.
- Thanks.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.657
- Hey, Lulu.
- Hi.

04:55.757 --> 04:56.818
- It's a packed house
out there.

04:56.918 --> 04:57.979
How are you feeling?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:58.079 --> 04:59.100
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.101
You know,
I thought I would have

05:00.201 --> 05:01.343
some opening night jitters,

05:01.443 --> 05:02.544
but I think
because I was so nervous

05:02.644 --> 05:04.145
leading up to this that--

05:04.245 --> 05:05.787
that I think I got it all
out of my system,

05:05.887 --> 05:07.268
so now,
everything's gonna be fine.

05:07.368 --> 05:08.510
- It's not.
both: Oh!

05:08.610 --> 05:10.191
- [chuckles nervously]
Hi.

05:10.291 --> 05:11.552
Denise, this is Lauren.

05:11.652 --> 05:13.194
She's vice principal
here at Windmount.

05:13.294 --> 05:15.396
- You seem fun.
- I'm not.

05:15.496 --> 05:17.799
Listen,
hate to burst your bubble,

05:17.899 --> 05:19.680
but Ethan can't run the lights.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.402
His parents just got divorced

05:21.502 --> 05:22.683
and his dad took him
to Disney World.

05:22.783 --> 05:24.125
- Oh, no.
What happens now?

05:24.225 --> 05:27.808
- Well, I imagine
Ethan will live with his mum.

05:27.908 --> 05:29.730
Well, things could change
with this trip.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.091
- No, I mean with the lights.

05:31.191 --> 05:32.573
- Oh.

05:32.673 --> 05:34.415
I guess I will take care of it.

05:34.515 --> 05:37.418
- You'd do that?
- I mean, it's sort of my job.

05:37.518 --> 05:40.781
And also, you know,
I love the students.

05:40.881 --> 05:42.823
- Picking up
a slight bit of sarcasm.

05:42.923 --> 05:44.464
- Mm-hmm.
[breathing shakily]

05:44.564 --> 05:45.906
Here come the jitters.

05:46.006 --> 05:47.147
- Okay, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.709
- Mm-hmm.
- Nothing else will go wrong.

05:48.809 --> 05:50.871
- Sarah,
something's gone wrong.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.993
- Felt myself jinxing it
as I was saying it.

05:53.093 --> 05:54.875
- We had to cancel the catering
from Carl's Cantina.

05:54.975 --> 05:56.476
Ooh, that's like
a vocal warmup.

05:56.576 --> 05:58.078
Carl's Cantina's
catering's canceled--

05:58.178 --> 06:00.160
- Okay, Zarrow, what happened?
- Bad batch of romaine.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.241
- Oh, okay.

06:01.341 --> 06:03.243
So parents will just
have to sit

06:03.343 --> 06:05.365
through a three-hour musical
on an empty stomach.

06:05.465 --> 06:06.606
- Don't worry,
your assistant director

06:06.706 --> 06:08.448
will be right by your side.

06:08.548 --> 06:10.450
Wait, scratch that, I think
I'm about to be violently ill.

06:10.550 --> 06:12.131
[stomach gurgling]
- Oh, no, you didn't--

06:12.231 --> 06:14.053
- I may have had lunch
at Carl's Cantina.

06:14.153 --> 06:15.975
They're known
for their lettuce cups.

06:16.075 --> 06:17.857
Break legs. Kisses.
[stomach gurgling]

06:17.957 --> 06:19.378
Ooh, I'm in real trouble.
Ooh!

06:19.478 --> 06:21.621
- [breathing shakily]

06:21.721 --> 06:22.822
Oh, it's fine.
I'm fine.

06:22.922 --> 06:24.864
It's gonna be fine.
- Mm-hmm.

06:24.964 --> 06:26.545
- She must have fallen
into a sinkhole.

06:26.645 --> 06:27.947
- Who?
- My agent.

06:28.047 --> 06:29.428
She must have been
driving along,

06:29.528 --> 06:31.470
about to call me,
when the Earth just opened up

06:31.570 --> 06:33.072
and swallowed her whole.

06:33.172 --> 06:34.633
It's literally
the only explanation.

06:34.733 --> 06:37.076
- Okay, I'm taking
your gummy too.

06:37.176 --> 06:39.078
You sure that's a good idea?

06:39.178 --> 06:40.119
- It's fine.

06:40.219 --> 06:41.800
Worst case, I fall asleep.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.242
[whispering]
Which is also best case.

06:43.342 --> 06:44.923
- Marina!

06:45.023 --> 06:46.565
- That's weird.
It's already kicking in.

06:46.665 --> 06:48.166
I thought I just heard my boss.

06:48.266 --> 06:51.209
- Marina! Marina!

06:51.309 --> 06:52.651
- And now I think
I'm seeing my boss.

06:52.751 --> 06:54.853
- Wait, that's Robot Richard?

06:54.953 --> 06:56.735
- Yep,
he's utterly emotionless.

06:56.835 --> 06:58.817
- Marina, I thought
that was you, and it was.

06:58.917 --> 06:59.858
What a pleasant surprise.

06:59.958 --> 07:01.099
- What are you doing here?

07:01.199 --> 07:02.540
I mean, Richard, hi!

07:02.640 --> 07:04.702
What are you--
what are you doing here?

07:04.802 --> 07:06.544
- I have a niece in the show.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.680
Please open this door.

14:55.780 --> 14:57.482
- Hey, there you are.
How's it going?

14:57.582 --> 14:59.244
- Really bad.
Really bad.

14:59.344 --> 15:00.565
Um, I was so desperate

15:00.665 --> 15:01.966
that everything would
go off without a hitch

15:02.066 --> 15:03.128
that now
it's not even going off.

15:03.228 --> 15:04.449
- Well, nothing's
gonna be perfect,

15:04.549 --> 15:05.890
and no one expects this to be.

15:05.990 --> 15:07.852
- I was.
I was expecting it to be.

15:07.952 --> 15:09.133
Guys!

15:09.233 --> 15:11.776
- Lulu, listen.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.137
When my second graders
draw a picture

15:13.237 --> 15:14.499
of some squiggly lines,

15:14.599 --> 15:16.661
their parents love it
because they don't know

15:16.761 --> 15:18.703
their kid was trying
to draw a horse.

15:18.803 --> 15:20.344
- Okay, I know that this is
supposed to be profound,

15:20.444 --> 15:21.265
but what are you trying to say?

15:21.365 --> 15:22.586
- Stop obsessing

15:22.686 --> 15:24.228
over what the show's
supposed to be

15:24.328 --> 15:26.610
and get those kids out there
and make some squiggly lines!

15:29.373 --> 15:30.875
Also, the door's unlocked.
- I was gonna try that.

15:30.975 --> 15:33.277
Yeah. Hi, guys!

15:33.377 --> 15:36.760
- She's been on this show
called "Influencer Lagoon"

15:36.860 --> 15:38.082
for the last couple weeks,

15:38.182 --> 15:41.004
and...I don't know
if it's just the editing,

15:41.104 --> 15:41.945
but I feel like
there's something

15:42.025 --> 15:43.327
between her and Lil Taytay.

15:43.427 --> 15:45.409
- Yeah, there was
definitely a spark

15:45.509 --> 15:47.371
when they were playing
that game, Hashtag You're It.

15:47.471 --> 15:49.333
It's a bad show.

15:49.433 --> 15:52.015
- Anyway, I guess it's just
been a bit of a tough year

15:52.115 --> 15:53.176
since the divorce.

15:53.276 --> 15:55.178
- Oh, you will get over that.

15:55.278 --> 15:58.301
Being divorced is the best.

15:58.401 --> 15:59.663
You have nobody to answer to.

15:59.763 --> 16:01.144
Like tonight, after this,

16:01.244 --> 16:03.466
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna take a bath,

16:03.566 --> 16:06.950
and eat a chunk of cheese
like it's an apple.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.511
- Maybe you're right.

16:08.611 --> 16:10.673
Maybe I need to eat
more bath cheese

16:10.773 --> 16:12.915
and stop chasing some feeling

16:13.015 --> 16:14.597
that always seems
to end up in sadness.

16:14.697 --> 16:16.319
- Now you're getting it.

16:16.419 --> 16:17.720
Feelings are for dummies.

16:17.820 --> 16:20.323
Hey, pistachio me?

16:20.423 --> 16:22.425
- Ooh!

16:24.587 --> 16:27.009
- So do we file a subpoena
on their tax records now

16:27.109 --> 16:29.291
or wait on a full audit
on the value of the property

16:29.391 --> 16:31.053
before filing a motion
to disclose?

16:31.153 --> 16:33.656
- Hmm. Wow.
That's a great question.

16:33.756 --> 16:35.698
Such a weird word, "question."

16:35.798 --> 16:38.821
It's like a quest is on
for answers.

16:38.921 --> 16:41.063
- Richard, hi. Hi.
Should we get back in there?

16:41.163 --> 16:42.664
Oh, do you hear that?
I think it's starting.

16:42.764 --> 16:45.067
- I'm obviously excited to see
the top half of Julia Child,

16:45.167 --> 16:46.428
but I'd like to hear
Marina's response.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.990
- Uh, okay.

16:49.090 --> 16:51.353
Well, Richard...
[sighs]

16:51.453 --> 16:53.155
Like, what is property?

16:53.255 --> 16:54.236
- Yikes.
- You know?

16:54.336 --> 16:55.357
Like, do we own it,

16:55.457 --> 16:58.159
or in a way, does it own us?

16:58.259 --> 16:59.361
- That doesn't make much sense.

16:59.461 --> 17:00.442
- Yeah, well, I think

17:00.542 --> 17:02.003
what she's trying to say
is that--

17:02.103 --> 17:04.165
- Property is
an abstract concept.

17:04.265 --> 17:05.607
- No.
- I'm trying to follow you,

17:05.707 --> 17:06.848
but it's incredibly difficult.

17:06.948 --> 17:08.690
- Fine. I'm super high.

17:08.790 --> 17:09.971
- Marina--
- Yeah.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.372
I was supposed
to relax tonight.

17:11.472 --> 17:13.054
Tom was supposed to relax.

17:13.154 --> 17:14.615
We were all supposed to relax,
but we can't

17:14.715 --> 17:16.978
because we're all paranoid
about you and your questions.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.099
Questions, questions.
[snarling]

17:18.199 --> 17:19.500
- Hey, hey.
We're very sorry, okay?

17:19.600 --> 17:21.022
She would never be like this
at work.

17:21.122 --> 17:22.303
You know that.
- The quest is on.

17:22.403 --> 17:24.305
- She's a very serious person.
- Quest on!

17:24.405 --> 17:28.109
- Marina, I'm gonna have
to ask you to stop right there.

17:28.209 --> 17:30.030
Because I too am super high
right now.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.232
- Say what?
- What?

17:31.332 --> 17:32.473
- I'm tripping balls.

17:32.573 --> 17:34.915
I ate two THC-enhanced
sour straws.

17:35.015 --> 17:36.517
It's a 3 1/2 hour musical,
Marina.

17:36.617 --> 17:38.358
That's unacceptable.
I thought you would've known

17:38.458 --> 17:39.720
by the outrageous way
I was acting.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.962
- No, not really.
- No.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.884
This is how you always are,
Richard.

17:43.984 --> 17:45.365
- It's kind of you
to lie like that.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.807
The only reason I was
talking about work so much is,

17:46.907 --> 17:47.968
I was covering for

17:48.068 --> 17:49.730
how absolutely blazed I am
right now.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.371
Just blitzed out of my skull.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.694
I'm higher than Jerry Garcia
on the space shuttle.

17:54.794 --> 17:55.856
Nailed it.
- Right.

17:55.956 --> 17:57.377
Well, great.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.898
I can't believe
you're both high.

17:58.998 --> 18:00.740
- Don't be such a square, Tom.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.102
Now, can you help me back
to my seat?

18:02.202 --> 18:04.023
I can't feel my legs.
- I can't feel my hands.

18:04.123 --> 18:07.187
- Okay, well, let's get
you guys back to your seats.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.269
Stick together.
I don't want to lose anyone.

18:09.369 --> 18:11.030
Okay, that's enough food.
Ooh, got you, buddy.

18:11.130 --> 18:12.352
