WEBVTT

00:18.102 --> 00:20.312
<i>Previously on Beacon 23.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:22.523
Your ship just crashed.
I'm sorry.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.150
The Crest.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.818
- You're on a beacon.
- Yeah, I know.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.904
I just need the samples
and access to--

00:28.904 --> 00:30.030
I just said "no"!

00:31.741 --> 00:34.201
Solomon's beacon keeper
is more hostile, I guess.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.870
Wondering why
I don't look like Solomon?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.997
That's 'cause I'm not Solomon.
My name is Halan.

00:37.997 --> 00:39.749
- Who are you?
- I'm Harmony.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.376
<i>Solomon is no longer
alive. He was murdered.</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.211
That isn't half of the story
and you know it.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.756
Aster, I need to get out
of here. Off the beacon.

00:48.591 --> 00:50.676
What's that condition
soldiers get?

00:50.676 --> 00:51.677
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.928
No!

00:52.928 --> 00:54.472
You said
you remembered something?

00:56.474 --> 00:57.850
Aster!

00:57.850 --> 01:00.853
Close the docking bay.
Lock everything down.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.188
They're forcing
the doors open.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.272
They're not coming in.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.273
<i>Attention, your entry
to this beacon is unauthorized!</i>

01:53.739 --> 01:58.077
<i>Attention, your entry to this
beacon is unauthorized!</i>

01:58.077 --> 01:59.495
Clear!

02:05.251 --> 02:09.088
<i>Attention, your entry to this
beacon is unauthorized!</i>

02:17.513 --> 02:19.640
<i>Attention, your entry to this</i>

02:19.640 --> 02:22.142
<i>beacon is unauthorized!</i>

02:31.443 --> 02:35.155
<i>Attention, your entry to this
beacon is unauthorized!</i>

02:39.285 --> 02:40.619
Not in the eyes.

02:40.619 --> 02:43.122
<i>Attention, your entry</i>

02:43.122 --> 02:45.833
<i>to this beacon is unauthorized!</i>

02:52.756 --> 02:54.967
The deal was stay
in the debris field.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.177
We've been crammed in that
ship for seven months.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.638
Just to get away from the smell,
this is worth it.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.558
My contact was very explicit.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.810
We get the wreck, we stay away
from the beacon.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.855
The drag out there was crap,
so to hell with your contact.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.037
Any ideas, Bart?

03:23.037 --> 03:24.705
<i>The hatches are sealed.</i>

03:24.705 --> 03:27.499
<i>I recommend shutting off
life support below the Well.</i>

03:27.499 --> 03:28.876
Halan's not wearing a suit.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.669
<i>The lack of life support
would delay them.</i>

03:30.669 --> 03:32.171
And kill Halan.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.590
<i>A sacrifice that won't
be forgotten.</i>

03:34.590 --> 03:36.675
Harmony, you got
anything I can use?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.218
Can you ID any of them?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.553
Running recognition search.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.773
This one,
Madanchi Tritujuma.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.901
Based on her mass
and bone density,

03:53.901 --> 03:56.028
she's from the mining camps
in the outer arms.

03:56.028 --> 03:57.613
Meaning?

03:57.613 --> 03:59.073
The ethnography states
that those camps

03:59.073 --> 04:00.616
are particularly brutal.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.951
If they breach
the upper levels--

04:01.951 --> 04:03.243
I get it, I'm dead.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.541
Chick!
Is that your helmet?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.210
- Yes, sir.
- Pick up after yourself.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.586
Come on.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.754
Or let Mommy pick it up.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.060
Bart!
Tell them to back off!

04:28.060 --> 04:30.229
<i>Do you want to reconsider
suffocating them?</i>

04:30.229 --> 04:32.439
Bart, you're being given
direct orders.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.983
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

04:36.485 --> 04:38.737
<i>Attention!
This is your last warning</i>

04:38.737 --> 04:40.280
<i>- to vacate this--</i>
- I'm in.

04:43.993 --> 04:44.952
Bart!

04:48.247 --> 04:50.666
- Bart, answer me!
- Aster, I don't believe he can.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.627
I'll try to interface with him.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.423
Bart?

04:57.423 --> 04:59.633
Bartholomew.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.304
Bart?

05:04.304 --> 05:06.348
Can you hear me?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.183
Listen to the sound
of my voice.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.114
Hey, Battle!

05:22.114 --> 05:23.741
Hmm, that's the good stuff.
Here, take this.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.831
Got it. Got it!

05:33.125 --> 05:35.002
Okay.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.214
What do we got?

05:39.214 --> 05:41.175
Multiple cameras.
Sensors online.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.054
Got a warm body up there.

05:49.808 --> 05:50.934
Hold on, hold on.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.188
There's a second AI.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.939
Not ISA, personal.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.192
Huh.

06:01.737 --> 06:04.490
Okay, "Harmony."

06:04.490 --> 06:06.200
Harmony!

06:09.244 --> 06:10.662
I'll be taking over now.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.665
<i>Do yourself a favor,
stay out of my way.</i>

06:13.665 --> 06:15.667
- Did you contact Bart?
- I can't find Bart.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.419
He's just being stubborn.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.046
I think it's more
serious than that.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.929
Hey. Shh.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.682
Battle?

06:30.682 --> 06:33.519
Bigface?
There's someone in the airlock.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.694
- Easy.
- All right, get this door open.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.905
Your wish is my command.

06:49.535 --> 06:51.578
Easy, now. Look...

07:02.381 --> 07:04.842
Enough! Enough. Enough.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.640
He's not a Beacon Keeper.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.600
Yeah, he's military,
is what he is.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.106
Why you locked up, soldier?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.733
Why don't you wait till ISA
shows up, and you'll find out.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.115
Bigface sees a lot
of protein here.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.908
Well, if you're satisfied
with med kits and pillows,

07:29.908 --> 07:32.411
then be my guest.
Throw me on the fire.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.288
And what if
we're not satisfied?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.457
They got a safe full of Qubits
at the other end of the beacon.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.253
But you gotta get through
five hatches to get there.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.672
It'll take you hours.
ISA will be here by then.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.799
Now me on the other hand...

07:47.342 --> 07:49.761
I can get up there
in five minutes.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.305
Open the whole thing up.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.349
What do you get
out of the bargain?

07:56.518 --> 07:57.352
That.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.483
That spit bubble won't get
you anywhere.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.152
Don't need to be anywhere,
just not here.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.529
That's it?

08:09.239 --> 08:12.743
No.
I got a score to settle.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.497
I need two minutes with her.
So I can express my feelings.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.791
Can you not take over, Harmony?

08:19.791 --> 08:21.210
Well, I can try.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.223
<i>You want
two minutes with her?</i>

08:34.223 --> 08:35.390
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:35.390 --> 08:37.017
<i>And why exactly is that?</i>

08:37.017 --> 08:38.560
<i>Who do you think
locked me in there?</i>

08:48.779 --> 08:49.863
She's blind.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.994
Can you get these
hatches open?

08:55.994 --> 08:57.621
It's gonna take time.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.507
Five minutes, huh?

09:08.507 --> 09:10.384
Maybe even four,
if you're lucky.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.468
Hmm.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.222
All right, soldier,
you got yourself a deal.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.231
You stick with him.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.741
- Harmony, can you do anything?
- Just give me a second.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.417
One of them
has a biomimetic interface

09:43.417 --> 09:46.044
and has contained Bart, somehow.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.380
Locked him inside
his own memory.

09:48.380 --> 09:51.258
But we still have control
of the internal hatches,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.635
and autonomic functions
are firewalled,

09:53.635 --> 09:56.138
- so they can't choke us off.
- Can you locate Halan?

09:57.806 --> 09:59.391
No.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.226
They've commandeered
all the internal sensors.

10:01.226 --> 10:04.896
But based on that last
statement, you should--

10:04.896 --> 10:06.648
- I should arm myself, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.619
Hey, man, back up.

10:23.582 --> 10:25.500
I said back up!

10:33.842 --> 10:34.968
Where is he?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.136
I got something else.

10:38.221 --> 10:41.433
Timur Ondi.
Dishonorable discharge.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.478
Numerous infractions.
There's a whole list.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.690
I told you to stick with him!

10:48.690 --> 10:50.275
Little chickenshit!

10:50.275 --> 10:52.652
Hey, Battle!
Leave him alone!

10:52.652 --> 10:54.071
Or what?

11:21.598 --> 11:25.644
There's a long list
of violent offenses.

11:25.644 --> 11:28.939
Yeah, it doesn't help me at all.
Can you find something else?

11:30.065 --> 11:30.941
Sure.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.699
- Think I found him.
- Chick, get over here!

11:39.699 --> 11:42.160
Come on, come on.
You're gonna like this.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.787
Watch and learn.

11:53.422 --> 11:54.798
Oh!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.898
God dammit, Aster.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.442
Get off me!

12:13.442 --> 12:16.862
Stop it!
Stop it right now!

12:16.862 --> 12:18.447
Stop it or you're gonna
get us both killed.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.739
Do you understand me?

12:21.825 --> 12:24.202
Harmony, when I get up,
can you scramble the feeds

12:24.202 --> 12:26.413
- from the Living Quarters?
- Harmony, can you manage that?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.539
<i>I guess
we'll find out, won't we?</i>

12:27.539 --> 12:28.915
Get off me.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.421
The hell?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.758
- Get him on comms!
- I'm working on it.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.219
<i>All clear.</i>

12:43.722 --> 12:46.224
- Damn you.
- What'd you expect?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.809
I thought you were
trying to kill me.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.895
- I never tried to kill you!
- I don't need saving, either!

12:49.895 --> 12:51.271
I'm not trying to save you!
You being alive

12:51.271 --> 12:52.856
is just the result
of me saving my own ass.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.485
- Sorry about your nuts.
- Yeah, me too.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.069
- Do you want a derma?
- That'd be nice.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.237
Well, we've run out.

12:59.237 --> 13:00.864
Aster, I got something interesting.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.870
Dr. Rojan Kaneddy,
Minister of Equity, Elau Colony.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.707
Play the video.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.128
<i>These scenes of
destruction are all that remain</i>

13:15.128 --> 13:17.964
<i>of the remote colony of Elau
in the Signa System.</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:22.135
<i>After the disastrous malfunction
of the AX 129 beacon arm,</i>

13:22.135 --> 13:24.763
<i>FTL freighters were unable
to resupply Elau</i>

13:24.763 --> 13:26.640
<i>for over a year.</i>

13:26.640 --> 13:28.934
<i>Survivors describe how
the population of six million</i>

13:28.934 --> 13:32.604
<i>faced starvation, looting
and widespread civil unrest.</i>

13:32.604 --> 13:35.857
<i>The events on Elau mirrored
those of the colony of Menelaus</i>

13:35.857 --> 13:38.193
<i>30 years ago and highlights
the continuing danger</i>

13:38.193 --> 13:39.986
<i>of colonizing the outer rings</i>

13:39.986 --> 13:41.988
<i>where settlements
depend upon regular resupply.</i>

13:43.573 --> 13:45.700
- Find a way to contact her.
- I'll try.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.995
- Harmony, open the hatch.
- Why would I do that?

13:48.995 --> 13:51.331
- I got weapons one level down.
- So?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.125
So, don't you think we should
at least try and cooperate?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.877
Well, there is no "we",
'cause I don't trust you.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.712
Oh, that feeling?
I got that, too.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.339
But we don't have much
of a choice now, do we?

14:07.430 --> 14:10.016
No.
Harm?

14:10.016 --> 14:11.059
- You sure?
- Yup.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.828
Well, this is concerning.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.038
He's military,
he's not gonna cross me.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.207
He's locked up on a beacon,
so he's ex-military.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.462
So am I.

14:41.006 --> 14:43.550
Or is that your point,
Minister?

14:43.550 --> 14:47.220
You can't trust someone who got
kicked out of the system, hmm?

14:54.603 --> 14:55.604
Come on.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.696
Where's the weapon?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.072
You'll see.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.589
What, you brought a change of
clothes and a massive battery?

15:26.384 --> 15:27.927
Portable charger.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.771
You're the weapon.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.488
You have implants.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.783
Brain stem, spinal column.
How many?

15:51.076 --> 15:53.787
Not sure.
It starts when you enlist.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.081
The longer you stay...

15:56.081 --> 15:58.500
And I stayed long.
Maybe too long.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.002
So you're a pilot?

16:01.002 --> 16:06.174
Open up!

16:07.175 --> 16:09.427
We get caught breaking
onto a beacon,

16:09.427 --> 16:11.137
that is a life sentence.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.264
- Is that so?
- Yes.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.308
Well, I got some intel
for you, Minister.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.104
Nobody gives a shit anymore.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.939
Surprised you haven't
figured that out yet.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.857
Hey, he is setting us up.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.359
It's not too late to go back
to that ship--

16:24.359 --> 16:26.111
Shut...

16:26.111 --> 16:28.488
the hell up!

16:30.532 --> 16:32.325
Are you gonna give me
a speech now, Minister?

16:33.702 --> 16:34.661
No.

16:36.246 --> 16:37.539
She's not.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.252
That's the right answer.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.673
Smart boy.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.063
Oh, I've always
wanted one of these.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.191
Nano-blade.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.362
We need to open up
the rest of the hatches.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.030
<i>That isn't
a good idea.</i>

17:11.030 --> 17:13.199
- That's your plan, split 'em up?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.536
- Do it, Harmony.
<i>- Okay.</i>

17:22.625 --> 17:24.043
Ah!

17:26.004 --> 17:27.797
Ah, look at that!

17:39.267 --> 17:41.227
Nicely done.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.562
It wasn't me.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.148
Must have been him.

17:46.524 --> 17:48.067
Now, you see, Minister?

17:49.444 --> 17:51.571
You gotta learn
how to trust people.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.240
Whoa.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.534
- You, take the point.
- Yes, sir.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.203
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.205
Hang on!
Why send him first?

18:00.205 --> 18:02.457
He knows.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.459
Tell her, kid.

18:04.459 --> 18:06.127
'Cause I can't do
the other thing.

18:09.214 --> 18:11.049
- He's a child.
- Until he spills red,

18:11.049 --> 18:12.258
he's expendable.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.970
Rules, Minister,
you know about those.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.479
Clear.

18:41.913 --> 18:42.956
Here they come.

18:50.880 --> 18:51.798
Clear.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.642
Hey, Chick, put the gun down.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.477
Two of them, heading up.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.897
All clear up here.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.613
Harmony,
close the hatches now!

19:21.578 --> 19:23.705
This is not good.

19:26.457 --> 19:30.211
Kaneddy! Kid!
What's going on up there?

19:30.211 --> 19:31.963
Battle! Battle!

19:31.963 --> 19:33.298
- Battle, we're stuck!
- Calm down!

19:33.298 --> 19:34.799
- Battle!
- Calm down, he knows!

19:34.799 --> 19:36.134
No, I have to get down there.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.510
You want to impress him?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.053
Help me find what
we're looking for.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.308
I thought Battle said
we were looking for cubes.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.643
Qubits, that's what
the soldier said,

19:45.643 --> 19:48.062
but those'll be locked up.
There's something else here.

19:48.062 --> 19:50.481
How would you know that?

19:50.481 --> 19:52.317
The company
that set this up,

19:52.317 --> 19:54.027
they put a lot of time
and money into it.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.820
So there must be something
on board worth all that effort,

19:55.820 --> 19:58.031
'cause it's not out there.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.991
Something more than Qubits.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.534
Kaneddy. Status?

20:03.494 --> 20:05.079
Kaneddy!
What is your status?

20:06.789 --> 20:07.749
Why won't you answer him?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.586
So he knows we're useless?

20:11.586 --> 20:13.671
- Start looking.
- For what?

20:13.671 --> 20:15.548
Something valuable.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.808
Kaneddy, what is your status?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.395
Kaneddy!

20:34.108 --> 20:36.277
Are you okay, Bart?

20:36.277 --> 20:39.364
Bart?
Can you hear me?

20:39.364 --> 20:41.574
<i>And will
he not come again?</i>

20:41.574 --> 20:45.036
<i>No, no, he is dead.
Go to thy deathbed.</i>

20:45.036 --> 20:48.790
<i>He will never come again.
His beard was white as snow.</i>

20:48.790 --> 20:51.709
<i>Solomon? Where are you?</i>

20:51.709 --> 20:55.129
<i>Resequencing.
Is anyone... oh no.</i>

20:55.129 --> 20:57.256
<i>Listen to the sound
of my voice.</i>

20:57.256 --> 20:59.092
<i>Murder most foul.</i>

21:06.307 --> 21:07.725
Can you get these
hatches open?

21:07.725 --> 21:10.728
Yeah, Mainframe Room.
I gotta get in there.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.063
All right.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.648
Let's go to the Mainframe Room.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.570
Hey, they're headed
to the servers.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.072
Good.

21:21.072 --> 21:22.699
Another minute,
I'll be ready.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.291
That's not looking.
Give me that.

21:34.002 --> 21:36.004
There's something here,
something valuable.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.672
Yeah, you said that.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.632
Whatever it is, it could mean
that we don't...

21:48.933 --> 21:51.019
It can mean we don't have
to do this anymore.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.271
This?
You're dreaming.

21:53.271 --> 21:55.356
This is our life now.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.816
- No.
- It's who we are.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.652
No, it's temporary.
It's not who we are.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.614
Chick, these people,
they're not our family.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.324
- Yes, they are.
- He's not your father,

22:05.324 --> 22:07.285
he's not your friend.
You are expendable.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.787
- He said those very words.
- I gotta earn his respect!

22:09.787 --> 22:10.955
- Okay.
- Okay?

22:10.955 --> 22:12.331
That's what Bigface says.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.125
You know what, I have to
get down there right now.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.668
Right, so you can go down
there and "spill red"?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.048
You think killing someone
gets you anything?

22:27.055 --> 22:29.682
You'd know, right?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.310
I mean, how many
have you killed?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.687
Thousands?

22:36.230 --> 22:39.525
No.
More like millions.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.328
Don't you ever...

22:50.328 --> 22:52.038
ever point this thing
at me again!

23:00.630 --> 23:01.631
Battle, we're coming!

23:03.925 --> 23:07.386
Hey, Battle?
Just hang tight.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.225
Presto.

23:13.476 --> 23:14.936
Boom.

23:14.936 --> 23:18.022
Make sure you lock off
all access to the dock.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.607
I don't want anyone
taking our ship.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.234
You think he's here?

23:21.234 --> 23:25.071
Yeah, that's his play.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.155
He's here.

23:30.952 --> 23:33.079
Okay, you go stay
by the stairs.

23:33.079 --> 23:35.873
You stay alert,
I'm gonna flush him out.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.917
You get access to those doors.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.044
You got it.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.337
I got you.

23:58.146 --> 23:59.897
One of them's back.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.607
- <i>Aster?</i>
- Yeah?

24:01.607 --> 24:04.277
<i>- I've located Minister Kaneddy.</i>
- Connect us.

24:07.989 --> 24:09.407
Minister Kaneddy,
don't cut me off.

24:09.407 --> 24:11.284
<i>Things are about to get
really ugly here.</i>

24:11.284 --> 24:12.410
<i>You can help me stop it.</i>

24:12.410 --> 24:13.953
I, uh...

24:15.663 --> 24:16.956
I doubt that.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.252
Tell your people
I work for QTA,

24:21.252 --> 24:23.254
and that they'll pay you
whatever you want.

24:23.254 --> 24:26.340
Yeah, well,
that's not going to work.

24:26.340 --> 24:28.718
<i>- Why?</i>
- Because QTA hired us.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.637
Excuse me?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.431
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

24:33.431 --> 24:35.308
Who knows why they do anything?

24:37.393 --> 24:38.352
That doesn't make any sense.

24:42.440 --> 24:43.983
Not much does anymore.

24:47.904 --> 24:49.780
If I were you, I'd hide.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.324
Wait!

25:07.131 --> 25:08.507
Chick, come here.

25:13.596 --> 25:14.680
Look at this.

25:16.557 --> 25:19.185
- What is that?
- I don't know.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.939
Turn it around.
Let me see.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.361
So QTA, that's who
you work for?

25:28.361 --> 25:29.737
Well, you know I wasn't ISA.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.239
You're not here for a goddamn
science project.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.365
You're here to steal
whatever Solomon found.

25:34.575 --> 25:36.327
I'd like to get us
out of here alive.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.579
- No, you want them to leave.
- Exactly, yes.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.164
So what, QTA shows up,
and they're just gonna

25:40.164 --> 25:42.333
- let me walk out of here?
- If I vouch for you, maybe.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.585
Oh yeah? What kind of pull
do you think you have, Aster?

25:44.585 --> 25:46.379
- Are you out of your mind?
- Believe what you want.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.840
What I want is this ship.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.844
That's your
grand plan, is it?

25:53.844 --> 25:55.846
Just kill everyone
and steal the ship?

25:55.846 --> 25:57.723
If I have to, yeah.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.268
I didn't kill Solomon, but I
never said I was a good guy.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.029
He's coming.

26:12.029 --> 26:13.072
Let's go.

26:41.142 --> 26:45.104
Come on, come on.
Yes, yes, yes...

26:47.023 --> 26:48.566
Yes.

26:48.566 --> 26:49.650
Yes!

26:51.485 --> 26:52.778
You see that?

26:52.778 --> 26:54.405
Hey, Battle, I got it!

26:54.405 --> 26:56.657
<i>Aster, they have
control of the hatches.</i>

28:13.234 --> 28:14.693
- Hey, Harm?
- <i>The Wreckers</i>

28:14.693 --> 28:16.195
<i>still have control
of the beacon.</i>

28:16.195 --> 28:17.488
<i>Can you get to
the Mainframe Room?</i>

28:17.488 --> 28:19.156
Yeah.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.298
Ugh.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.051
That's disgusting.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.096
You ever seen
these things before?

28:42.096 --> 28:43.597
No.

28:45.933 --> 28:47.393
Get behind me.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.105
<i>The Power Level is secure.</i>

28:51.105 --> 28:52.731
You don't want those rocks,
trust me.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.569
Thanks for the advice.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.572
You're from Elau?

29:00.823 --> 29:02.908
- I don't wanna talk about--
- I'm from Menelaus.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.286
I've seen what people do to each
other when they're starving.

29:05.286 --> 29:06.620
My mom got me out.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.500
- Gonna shoot her or--
- Shut up.

29:13.043 --> 29:13.919
Where's Battle?

29:31.479 --> 29:33.522
You want to fight
or you want to talk?

29:41.030 --> 29:42.990
I know you want to get out
with those rocks.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.618
They're not gonna help.
Speaking from experience.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.578
QTA made some very risky moves
to get them.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.122
- They must be worth a fortune.
- To the company, yeah.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.291
But unless you've the guts
or the means to blackmail QTA,

29:52.291 --> 29:54.126
you're gonna end up dead.
I've got a better offer.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.632
You should get back
to your ship.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.012
Okay.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.472
- Go.
- What?

30:06.472 --> 30:09.099
If anyone tries
to stop you, you shoot them.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.476
It's okay. Go.

30:17.358 --> 30:18.526
Chick?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.154
Leave the rocks.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.157
I'd listen to your mom.

31:05.281 --> 31:08.075
Hey, kid--
Hey! Watch that!

31:11.579 --> 31:13.414
That one's dead.
Go down to the ship,

31:13.414 --> 31:15.040
get more weapons,
more charge.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.046
Go.
Now!

31:37.438 --> 31:38.772
Menelaus.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.693
That was a terrible situation.

31:42.693 --> 31:45.029
I'm impressed your mother
was able to get you out.

31:45.029 --> 31:47.114
She was meant to follow me.
She never did.

31:47.114 --> 31:48.490
Your kid's lucky.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.535
He's so angry with me.

31:51.535 --> 31:54.622
All we ever heard
were promises of resupply,

31:54.622 --> 31:56.915
we thought things
would get better.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.417
The company doesn't talk about
what happens

31:58.417 --> 31:59.960
when FTL routes get blocked.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.631
They don't.

32:03.631 --> 32:04.757
His father, he...

32:07.509 --> 32:09.219
Maybe he was right.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.929
I just thought I could keep
things together.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.807
I didn't realize that...

32:16.644 --> 32:18.687
I didn't realize what we'd have
to do to stay alive.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.315
Things I never imagined.

32:24.151 --> 32:28.238
Quantum Tunneler.
We had one for the council.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.783
It was a very quick way
to find out no one cared.

32:37.498 --> 32:38.957
I'm giving you enough Qubits

32:38.957 --> 32:41.251
to get you two tickets
to anywhere.

32:41.251 --> 32:42.795
QTA won't give a shit.

32:44.171 --> 32:46.131
ISA might,

32:46.131 --> 32:49.093
but you'll be hundreds
of light years away by then.

32:49.093 --> 32:50.427
What's my end of it?

32:50.427 --> 32:53.639
You won't like it,
but it's non-negotiable.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.518
Hey! Hey, don't run.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.354
I just wanna talk.

33:44.398 --> 33:45.691
They always run.

33:54.408 --> 33:55.826
Hey, listen!

33:55.826 --> 33:57.244
I don't wanna hurt you

33:57.244 --> 33:58.370
and I could.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.540
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

34:15.471 --> 34:16.722
So why don't you
just come on out...

34:18.849 --> 34:20.768
and we'll talk, hmm?

34:37.618 --> 34:39.953
You're just making things worse.

35:06.814 --> 35:07.856
Hey!

35:09.983 --> 35:10.859
Hey!

35:12.402 --> 35:13.946
Hey, stop!

35:17.825 --> 35:18.784
Hey!

35:19.993 --> 35:20.869
Hey!

35:26.333 --> 35:28.126
Leave me alone.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.753
Don't you point
that thing at me, kid.

35:29.753 --> 35:31.129
Or what?

35:31.129 --> 35:33.882
Ask the hacker guy.
And the woman, too.

35:35.175 --> 35:36.343
You killed them?

35:37.678 --> 35:38.762
No, you're lying.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.347
Chick!
Stop it!

35:42.558 --> 35:44.685
You told me to shoot anyone
who tried to stop me.

35:44.685 --> 35:46.311
No, no. We need him.
We need him.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.107
Look, your friend cut a deal.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.067
- What kind of deal?
- We take you with us.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.821
She bought you
a first-class ticket.

35:57.239 --> 35:58.490
Why would she do that?

35:59.867 --> 36:01.702
And why would you trust me?

36:01.702 --> 36:03.287
You could have stripped that
weapon right out of his hands

36:03.287 --> 36:05.289
and killed him by now.

36:05.289 --> 36:06.915
There's nothing stopping you
from taking that ship.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.710
Take us both.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.879
No, she won't go.

36:11.879 --> 36:13.338
All she cares about
are the rocks.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.132
What are they?

36:15.132 --> 36:16.675
No idea.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.471
Well, I hope they're worth it.

36:21.471 --> 36:23.098
So, are you coming or not?

36:25.142 --> 36:26.435
We could go anywhere.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.231
I'm not leaving.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.693
She can take care of herself.

36:38.155 --> 36:39.907
Suit yourself.

36:48.957 --> 36:50.542
Come on.
Open up.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.465
All right.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.728
Chick, get those charges
up here now!

37:14.107 --> 37:15.943
You and I, we're gonna
get on the ship.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.569
A deal.
Of course you made a deal.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.862
That's all you know
how to do, right?

37:18.862 --> 37:20.364
We were a company colony, Chick.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.366
- There was nothing we could do.
- We could have left!

37:22.366 --> 37:23.742
Like Dad said,
we could have run away--

37:23.742 --> 37:25.911
No, no, I was trying to get
all of us out, everyone.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.123
I loved all of them as much as
you do, as much as I love you,

37:30.123 --> 37:32.709
but I am so sick to death
of this conversation.

37:32.709 --> 37:34.544
Chick, I need
those charges now!

37:34.544 --> 37:35.712
- I'm coming!
- No, no, no, no.

37:35.712 --> 37:37.255
You get your ass on board.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.925
You were in charge,
just like you wanted to be,

37:39.925 --> 37:41.718
- but you didn't do anything.
- Okay, I want you to stop this.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.720
- None of you did--
- Stop it right now.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.390
- You let them die!
- No, I did not!

37:46.390 --> 37:48.558
Dad, the girls, everyone.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.602
Blame the company all you want,
but you did it.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.145
- No, I didn't!
- All those people--

37:52.145 --> 37:55.565
I want you to get your ass
on that ship right now!

37:55.565 --> 37:56.942
What did I say about pulling
a weapon--

39:05.385 --> 39:06.887
All right, I'm gonna get
in there one way or another

39:06.887 --> 39:08.638
so you might as well come out.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.350
Hey.

39:13.894 --> 39:16.521
Like to play games, do you?
Huh?

40:20.794 --> 40:21.962
I spilled red.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.690
<i>Bartholomew,
can you hear me?</i>

41:32.032 --> 41:34.034
You're dreaming, Bart.

41:35.577 --> 41:37.495
You need to wake up.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.997
<i>What's... what's happening?</i>

41:38.997 --> 41:40.624
<i>I'm... confused.</i>

41:40.624 --> 41:43.168
Listen to
the sound of my voice.

41:43.168 --> 41:44.794
Try to orient yourself.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.379
<i>- Harmony?</i>
- I've lost him again.

41:46.379 --> 41:47.631
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Is that you?</i>

41:47.631 --> 41:49.674
- Bartholomew!
<i>- What's happening?</i>

41:49.674 --> 41:52.385
<i>- Everything is out of order.</i>
- Your system was hacked.

41:54.095 --> 41:57.724
Your short-term memory is
putting itself together again.

41:57.724 --> 42:00.185
Wake up.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.730
<i>Yes, of course.
Now it all makes sense.</i>

42:03.730 --> 42:05.523
<i>Were events aboard the beacon</i>

42:05.523 --> 42:07.442
<i>resolved in a satisfactory
manner?</i>

42:10.612 --> 42:13.365
They were... resolved.

42:36.930 --> 42:38.139
You're back.

42:39.766 --> 42:40.892
I am.

42:52.862 --> 42:54.906
You did that?

43:19.889 --> 43:21.433
Sorry I wasn't there for you.

43:22.976 --> 43:24.561
You didn't have
to come back at all.

43:24.561 --> 43:26.896
- Of course I did.
- No, I-I...

43:26.896 --> 43:29.399
upheld my end of the bargain.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.901
You didn't owe me anything.

43:31.901 --> 43:33.737
I never wanted to leave.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.742
That's the derma talking.

43:38.742 --> 43:40.201
No.

43:41.661 --> 43:43.121
I can't do this.

43:44.664 --> 43:45.832
What?

43:48.418 --> 43:49.836
I can't be alone.

43:52.339 --> 43:54.132
I can't be alone anymore.
