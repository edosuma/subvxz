WEBVTT

00:22.918 --> 00:24.542
<i>So, you saved his life</i>

00:25.292 --> 00:29.125
<i>because you thought he was gonna
give you a fresh start.</i>

00:31.042 --> 00:32.709
<i>A place to feel safe.</i>

00:33.751 --> 00:35.375
<i>A place to call home.</i>

00:37.459 --> 00:38.792
A family.

00:40.292 --> 00:41.626
Did he?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.918
No.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.000
<i>Found a place.</i>

00:49.292 --> 00:50.626
<i>Built a town.</i>

00:52.042 --> 00:53.375
<i>Filled it with people.</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:03.999
But my sis...

01:07.042 --> 01:08.375
My mom...

01:09.959 --> 01:14.667
she did the same thing, too,
ten times over, and...

01:15.709 --> 01:20.501
I still never felt comfortable
in my own skin in any of her places.

01:20.584 --> 01:21.918
You want to know why?

01:22.501 --> 01:26.125
Both of them wanted something
from you that you couldn't give them.

01:27.125 --> 01:29.417
For you to be somebody you're not.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.334
I heard you with Alicia.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.417
You want what all of us want.

01:35.918 --> 01:39.834
Someone to love you
just the way you are.

01:42.709 --> 01:46.083
And you really think I can find
that person in your new world?

01:48.959 --> 01:50.709
You already have.

01:53.792 --> 01:55.417
-You?
-Yes.

01:55.501 --> 01:59.167
Alicia, you put her in the bunker.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.999
I thought you saw
something special in her.

02:02.042 --> 02:03.667
Oh, you're right, I did.

02:04.209 --> 02:06.542
I love what Alicia will become,

02:07.334 --> 02:10.000
but that's something
that you and I will never be,

02:10.083 --> 02:12.334
and there's nothing
to feel sorry about there.

02:12.417 --> 02:13.751
You know?

02:14.459 --> 02:17.250
You are so much like me, Sioux.

02:17.334 --> 02:20.751
We are two very logical conclusions

02:20.834 --> 02:25.792
in a world that's built
on a foundation of violence

02:25.876 --> 02:29.417
and of lies and self-interest.

02:30.167 --> 02:31.876
It's why we understand each other.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.959
I think you'll agree with me

02:34.000 --> 02:38.792
when I say that conclusions
do not belong anywhere

02:38.876 --> 02:42.167
in a world where things
are just about to get started.

02:44.834 --> 02:46.918
So, what's gonna happen to us?

02:50.459 --> 02:54.417
We are going to die up here
with everyone else.

02:54.999 --> 02:57.000
Yeah, I know that's a lot to take in.

02:57.584 --> 02:59.584
Ask yourself this
when trying to figure out

02:59.667 --> 03:02.417
if you still want to be a part
of what we're doing here.

03:03.626 --> 03:06.792
Do you want to pretend
to be somebody else,

03:06.876 --> 03:09.334
just to have a chance
to keep on breathing?

03:09.417 --> 03:10.999
Or do you want to stay...

03:12.292 --> 03:16.375
just the way you are,
for whatever time we have left?

03:23.459 --> 03:24.792
I want to be who I am.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.584
Good girl.

03:31.918 --> 03:33.751
We're in the right place for that.

03:38.292 --> 03:40.792
That's just what's left
in the emergency batteries.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.542
We need to get diesels running
for everything else.

03:45.999 --> 03:47.584
How do you know about this stuff?

03:47.667 --> 03:50.042
I was the weapons officer
on this boat.

03:50.125 --> 03:53.167
When I found Riley,
he was a broken man.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.999
Weren't you, son?

03:55.876 --> 03:59.626
Broken,
because he found himself... like you.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.292
He found himself without a family.

04:04.083 --> 04:05.999
A family to call his own.

04:07.459 --> 04:08.792
Do you have them?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.459
Yeah.

04:16.209 --> 04:17.542
What's so funny?

04:19.542 --> 04:22.876
Virginia,
she had a thing about keys, too.

04:22.959 --> 04:25.542
Said they were gonna
unlock the future.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.083
Don't think
this is what she had in mind.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.459
Does he know?

04:37.209 --> 04:39.626
Does everyone know
that they're gonna die?

04:40.584 --> 04:42.876
Yeah. Everyone here is aware.

04:43.999 --> 04:46.667
How did you get them to follow,
knowing they're gonna die?

04:48.167 --> 04:50.125
It's easy
to get people to follow you.

04:50.209 --> 04:54.751
You just have to offer them something
they really want to believe in.

04:57.167 --> 05:00.125
<i>It's just that
not a lot of people want to die.</i>

05:07.542 --> 05:09.584
Getting them to do that...

05:11.083 --> 05:12.626
that takes something else.

05:22.083 --> 05:24.209
Something very few people have.

05:37.334 --> 05:38.667
What?

05:40.918 --> 05:42.250
<i>What does it take?</i>

05:43.501 --> 05:46.542
<i>Well, you know,
it's really not that complicated.</i>

05:48.292 --> 05:52.042
<i>You just have to be willing
to die with them.</i>

06:21.000 --> 06:22.584
So, you ready to do this?

06:24.375 --> 06:26.083
That's a rhetorical question?

06:39.626 --> 06:40.959
Let's go.

07:42.042 --> 07:43.959
It's a lot further down
than I thought.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.000
If it gets above 10,000 millirem,
we need to worry.

07:56.792 --> 07:58.501
-I should go down first.
-No.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.250
I got this.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.000
Got you covered.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.000
He's going in.
Where the hell are the schematics?

08:11.834 --> 08:13.542
Did Rachel find that naval base yet?

08:13.626 --> 08:17.083
<i>Only a few miles out. Heads up.
There are several SUVs out here.</i>

08:17.626 --> 08:19.083
<i>Looks like they beat us.</i>

08:19.167 --> 08:21.584
<i>-Tread lightly.</i>
-I'm worried about them out there.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.334
Well, if they fire the missile,

08:24.167 --> 08:26.751
being near this sub is probably
the safest place to be.

08:26.834 --> 08:28.584
Anywhere else, we're sitting ducks.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.417
So, we ready?

08:34.501 --> 08:36.959
We'll light up anything that moves,
dead or alive.

08:49.334 --> 08:50.667
What's the reading?

08:54.417 --> 08:56.250
Ten millirem.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.459
-What's the reading now?
-Just checking.

09:17.876 --> 09:20.042
It is still holding at ten.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.918
-You sure?
-I am.

09:22.334 --> 09:24.292
So the reading hasn't changed at all?

09:24.375 --> 09:26.459
I thought you said ten was good.

09:35.584 --> 09:36.918
Shoot it!

09:38.125 --> 09:39.459
Can't see!

09:53.042 --> 09:54.417
Thank you.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.459
The crew...

09:59.459 --> 10:01.417
They must have all died down here.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.751
What's it at now?

10:07.501 --> 10:09.209
It is still holding at ten.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.417
I'm going in. Cover me?

10:16.999 --> 10:18.292
Anything, Luci?

10:18.375 --> 10:21.292
<i>Stand by. Sarah,
Jacob and Charlie just landed.</i>

10:22.292 --> 10:25.083
<i>We're back from the base.
Rachel and them are staying there.</i>

10:25.167 --> 10:26.542
<i>The roof caved but...</i>

10:27.083 --> 10:30.167
<i>Long story short, a lot of these
Navy books are a bit soggy.</i>

10:30.250 --> 10:31.999
<i>Looking through them now for maps.</i>

10:44.501 --> 10:47.334
-You OK?
-Yeah. Fine.

10:48.542 --> 10:51.042
I'm the best person
to assess what's going on in here.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.999
Even if the reactor compartment's
still intact...

10:56.751 --> 10:58.542
these readings should be twice this.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.334
I know what you're trying to do.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.584
-Same thing as you are.
-Yeah. You want to make them pay.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.417
-Something wrong with that?
-No.

11:10.501 --> 11:12.626
It's just,
we haven't really talked about--

11:12.709 --> 11:14.334
Now is not the time.

11:18.292 --> 11:19.626
It's safe.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417
Let's do it.

11:31.501 --> 11:33.083
Grace, I haven't pushed it...

11:33.959 --> 11:35.626
because I understand the pain.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.292
But if we don't talk,
we might not get a chance.

11:38.375 --> 11:39.709
Why not?

11:39.792 --> 11:41.751
What needs to be done here
to stop them...

11:43.542 --> 11:45.042
I might not make it off the boat.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.876
We. We might not make it off.

11:48.501 --> 11:50.834
-I'm coming with you.
-No, you got to stay alive.

11:51.792 --> 11:55.334
Listen, hard as this is to hear,
you are here for a reason.

11:55.417 --> 11:56.751
You got to be.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.334
And I think... it might just be

12:00.417 --> 12:03.334
so that you can build that future
that Athena showed you.

12:07.417 --> 12:08.918
What about you?

12:10.542 --> 12:12.417
Shouldn't you be building it, too?

12:12.999 --> 12:16.375
First, we got to make sure there's
a world left behind to rebuild.

12:24.334 --> 12:25.667
Everyone alright?

12:26.292 --> 12:27.626
Yeah.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.000
-Morgan, let me take a look.
-No, I'm fine.

12:35.584 --> 12:36.918
I'm fine.

12:38.876 --> 12:40.250
I'm gonna take more readings.

12:44.751 --> 12:46.042
Just give her some time.

12:47.626 --> 12:50.292
-Yeah.
-Where are all these cult assholes?

12:52.751 --> 12:55.375
Well, they came in a goddamn caravan.

13:04.042 --> 13:06.626
It's not the assholes
you have to worry about right now.

13:15.167 --> 13:16.834
How many crew were on this boat?

13:17.250 --> 13:19.918
How many dead stand between us
and where we're going?

13:19.999 --> 13:21.292
Honey?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.626
Luci, you got an idea how many
crew members there were on this boat?

13:31.542 --> 13:32.876
Too much interference.

13:33.918 --> 13:36.042
It's gonna get worse
the deeper you get. Here.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.584
I'll walkie Luci.

13:40.876 --> 13:42.167
Let's go.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.000
Luci?

14:03.792 --> 14:05.083
Luci, can you hear me?

14:29.042 --> 14:30.375
Luci, can you hear me?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.334
<i>Go ahead.</i>

14:32.999 --> 14:34.751
We need to know the crew complement.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.584
<i>One hundred and fifty.</i>

14:41.667 --> 14:45.542
<i>-I repeat, 150.</i>
-Did you hear that?

14:46.834 --> 14:48.125
Did she just say 150?

14:49.709 --> 14:51.000
I wish she hadn't.

14:56.334 --> 14:57.999
Any idea what's beyond that hatch?

15:03.125 --> 15:05.918
-Can we see what's in the next room?
<i>-Missile compartment.</i>

15:05.999 --> 15:07.626
<i>A long hallway with silos.</i>

15:07.709 --> 15:09.501
<i>Clearest path to the weapons room.</i>

15:09.584 --> 15:11.584
<i>Where they'll be
if they're launching.</i>

15:12.959 --> 15:14.501
Is that the only way?

15:14.918 --> 15:17.459
-Is that the only way?
<i>-It looks like it.</i>

15:17.999 --> 15:19.792
Not sure
I packed enough ammo for this.

15:20.292 --> 15:22.334
Maybe we should
hold our fire down here.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.667
He's right. Alicia may be on board.

15:25.167 --> 15:28.209
And if she's not, we need whoever's
alive to find out where she is.

15:28.292 --> 15:31.709
When I get in there,
kill anything that slips by me.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.042
You're not going in there alone.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.584
-Nobody else needs to get hurt.
-Neither do you.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.083
Is this about
that note you were reading?

15:39.167 --> 15:41.999
-What are you talking about?
-You dropped it when you fell.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.501
This... This is not for you to read.

15:45.584 --> 15:48.459
Just because Dakota saved your life,
no need to give it up here.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.876
-Not what this is about.
-Then what's it about?

15:54.834 --> 15:58.209
I was halfway to being one of those
things. I know how to get past them.

15:58.292 --> 16:01.417
-Maybe so, but we'll be behind you.
-Come on.

16:01.501 --> 16:02.834
We've had our differences,

16:02.918 --> 16:04.709
but Alicia asked me
to take care of this.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.083
That's what I'm gonna do.

16:06.167 --> 16:09.125
You fellas done with the chitchat?
I'm coming, too.

16:10.999 --> 16:13.083
I gave up my family
to put this guy away.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.584
I'm not about to let him succeed now.

16:17.918 --> 16:20.209
-We're all coming in, Morgan.
-No use in arguing.

16:29.417 --> 16:30.792
Then let's open it up.

17:10.542 --> 17:11.876
It's clear.

17:18.501 --> 17:20.876
What is there, a dozen missiles?

17:22.167 --> 17:24.959
Enough to take out
a continent, at least.

17:34.584 --> 17:36.375
You locking us in?

17:36.459 --> 17:37.959
We don't want any surprises,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.834
in case any of his followers
get past our folks outside.

17:44.792 --> 17:47.792
Is there any way
we can dismantle these from here?

17:48.876 --> 17:51.959
Not sure if meddling with wires
we don't understand is a good idea.

17:52.999 --> 17:54.292
He's right.

17:54.792 --> 17:56.083
Levels are rising.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.792
You really think some psychopath

17:57.876 --> 18:00.667
who spent 40 years behind bars
knows how to work this shit?

18:00.751 --> 18:03.083
Or if these missiles
will even fly, D.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.417
No one's launching anything
if the power's out.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.542
Don't underestimate Teddy.
He always was a resourceful fella.

18:09.626 --> 18:10.959
Wait.

18:11.584 --> 18:12.918
Listen.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.584
-It's a full boat.
-Yeah.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.167
<i>I repeat, can you hear me?</i>

18:27.000 --> 18:28.334
Grace?

18:29.459 --> 18:32.459
I think this is the emergency comm.
Doesn't need power.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.626
Right. We're in the silo hall.

18:35.709 --> 18:37.751
Which way gets us
to the weapons room?

18:37.834 --> 18:40.417
<i>Stand by.
I'll ask Luci to take a look.</i>

18:42.334 --> 18:43.667
Luci, do you copy?

18:44.584 --> 18:46.542
<i>You sure got here fast.</i>

18:48.751 --> 18:51.042
-Who is this?
<i>-Oh, come on.</i>

18:51.125 --> 18:54.417
<i>-You know damn well who this is.</i>
-Teddy?

18:56.501 --> 18:59.459
Bingo. Is that you, Morgan?

18:59.542 --> 19:01.584
-It is.
-Let me.

19:04.667 --> 19:06.375
Do you recognize this voice, Teddy?

19:08.125 --> 19:09.667
No, I'm afraid I don't.

19:09.751 --> 19:11.083
I'll give you a hint.

19:11.167 --> 19:14.083
<i>Last time you heard it, you were in
a Denton County courthouse,</i>

19:14.167 --> 19:16.000
<i>listening to my testimony
against you.</i>

19:24.709 --> 19:27.417
Officer Dorie. Is that really you?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.999
Sorry I never paid you a visit.

19:30.584 --> 19:32.876
Never really had the stomach
for death row.

19:33.375 --> 19:34.999
Yeah, you couldn't kill me then,

19:35.042 --> 19:37.042
and you sure as shit
aren't gonna do it now.

19:37.125 --> 19:38.459
<i>Oh, I beg to differ.</i>

19:38.542 --> 19:41.876
I got a bullet I plan to put
in your head before this day ends.

19:43.542 --> 19:46.959
Well, I see today ending
quite differently, Officer.

19:47.459 --> 19:49.792
I hope you know
there are no hard feelings.

19:50.751 --> 19:52.626
If you hadn't put me away,

19:52.709 --> 19:55.209
I wouldn't be sitting
where I am right now.

19:55.292 --> 19:57.334
-Don't let him get to you.
-Alicia.

19:58.667 --> 19:59.999
Where's the girl?

20:00.542 --> 20:03.250
<i>You're going to have to be
more specific, Officer.</i>

20:03.334 --> 20:04.667
Alicia.

20:05.959 --> 20:07.959
Oh, she's safer than all of us.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.792
What does that mean?

20:10.876 --> 20:13.167
<i>It means
she's tucked away someplace</i>

20:13.250 --> 20:14.876
<i>where you'll never find her.</i>

20:15.834 --> 20:17.584
Tell us where the missiles will hit.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.417
You didn't think you'd be safe
up here by the boat, did you?

20:22.209 --> 20:24.000
Are you gonna kill your own people?

20:24.083 --> 20:26.709
<i>I'm giving them
a second chance, Morgan.</i>

20:27.334 --> 20:29.000
Grace, walkie Luci.

20:29.083 --> 20:31.999
<i>Tell her to get everybody as far
away from the sub as possible.</i>

20:32.417 --> 20:33.751
Luci, do you copy?

20:33.834 --> 20:35.375
<i>You brought your people with you?</i>

20:35.918 --> 20:39.083
Well, you see there, Mr. Jones,
we are like two peas in a pod.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.918
I am leading everyone to their end,

20:41.999 --> 20:45.834
and you are doing the same thing.

20:45.918 --> 20:49.292
Except I'm not fooling myself
about what I'm doing.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.751
We're almost there.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.292
<i>If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen, got to run.</i>

20:56.375 --> 20:58.417
<i>We're about to turn the power on.</i>

20:59.250 --> 21:00.584
Grace?

21:01.375 --> 21:03.042
-Grace?
<i>-I'm here.</i>

21:03.626 --> 21:05.876
Did you reach our people?
Can they get safe?

21:05.959 --> 21:08.876
The naval base. Charlie said
there was a basement there.

21:08.959 --> 21:10.417
<i>I'm not sure that's enough.</i>

21:11.292 --> 21:13.083
Then we will not fail.

21:23.209 --> 21:24.584
Where's Morgan?

21:36.792 --> 21:38.083
The hell?

21:38.167 --> 21:39.501
Morgan?

21:53.375 --> 21:54.709
Morgan?

22:06.792 --> 22:08.250
I wonder what happened in here.

22:08.334 --> 22:09.667
I don't know.

22:12.709 --> 22:14.000
Oh, man.

23:04.584 --> 23:05.918
-Morgan!
-Let go!

23:05.999 --> 23:07.292
This isn't on you.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.459
Get in.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.626
I don't need you to be here.

23:33.042 --> 23:35.042
You're not supposed
to do this by yourself.

23:35.125 --> 23:36.834
I don't want to let anybody else die.

23:36.918 --> 23:39.709
-No one has to die.
-But they might, Victor! They might!

23:41.999 --> 23:44.417
-You think you have to do this?
-What does that mean?

23:44.501 --> 23:46.999
Dakota's note.
She said you had things left to do.

23:47.042 --> 23:48.375
You think she meant this?

23:50.709 --> 23:54.125
I think I've been leading these
people from one dead end to another,

23:54.209 --> 23:57.250
all the time promising that
it will lead to something different,

23:57.334 --> 24:00.542
something better,
and I just want to be sure this time.

24:01.667 --> 24:04.250
She's a sociopath.
She wanted you to kill her mother.

24:04.334 --> 24:06.083
That's what she meant, not this.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.751
Well, that's as may be,
but I still got to make sure.

24:08.834 --> 24:11.250
Oh, man. Morgan...

24:12.375 --> 24:14.459
People follow you
because they want to,

24:14.542 --> 24:16.375
not because you owe them something.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.876
I don't know
why you're still here, Victor.

24:21.292 --> 24:24.209
Alicia asked me a difficult question
when we were at the lodge.

24:25.083 --> 24:28.250
She asked if I was doing this for
everyone or if I was doing it for me.

24:29.918 --> 24:31.209
And?

24:32.334 --> 24:34.042
I'm doing it for everyone.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.250
I need her to know that.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.834
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:40.542 --> 24:41.918
Really.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.626
We better stop this man so you can
tell her that for yourself.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.626
Morgan.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.417
I know.

25:06.876 --> 25:08.250
No, no, no. Don't touch it.

25:25.334 --> 25:26.667
Shit.

25:29.626 --> 25:31.083
Must have been one of Teddy's.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.375
We know where our friend came from.

25:44.459 --> 25:46.959
Yeah,
and why the readings are so hot.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.626
What's that?

25:53.209 --> 25:55.083
Sounds like a diesel turning over.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.792
This thing is about to get power.

26:01.542 --> 26:02.999
Grace, do you copy?

26:03.042 --> 26:04.417
<i>Morgan, I'm here.</i>

26:04.501 --> 26:07.000
So, we're past the silo room,
but the next door,

26:07.083 --> 26:08.459
it is off the charts.

26:08.542 --> 26:11.042
<i>-What's the reading?</i>
-It is 40,000.

26:11.584 --> 26:13.375
-Outside the compartment?
<i>-Yes.</i>

26:14.626 --> 26:17.876
You'd only get a reading like that
from exposed radioactive material

26:17.959 --> 26:19.250
inside the compartment.

26:20.042 --> 26:21.584
<i>You'll have to find another way.</i>

26:22.918 --> 26:24.209
<i>Morgan?</i>

26:25.459 --> 26:26.792
<i>Morgan?</i>

26:28.751 --> 26:30.417
<i>If you go in there,
it will kill you.</i>

26:31.167 --> 26:32.751
-When will it?
<i>-What do you mean?</i>

26:32.834 --> 26:35.667
-How long would I have?
-Well, I don't know. Days?

26:37.542 --> 26:41.125
-OK, maybe that's long enough.
-Morgan? Morgan!

26:55.542 --> 26:57.918
-Stand back.
-Hey, what are you doing?

26:57.999 --> 27:00.375
Going inside,
kill what's in there and keep going.

27:00.459 --> 27:03.667
-Because that's the only way.
-No. Wait. It's not. It's not.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.209
It's clear. We kill them,
we climb that ladder.

27:09.083 --> 27:12.042
We'll lose too much time, and we
don't even know what's up there.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.501
-You're not thinking.
-All I'm doing is thinking.

27:14.584 --> 27:17.083
To do what's best for everyone,
do what you told us to do.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.501
-What is that?
-Live.

27:26.834 --> 27:28.626
We better be fast, Strand.

27:33.459 --> 27:34.792
Strand?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.334
Is it clear?

27:46.542 --> 27:47.959
For now.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.999
Let's go.

28:32.292 --> 28:33.918
I told you there was another way.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.125
They must be getting closer
to launching.

28:43.375 --> 28:44.709
To the bunks.

28:57.042 --> 28:58.375
This is a dead end.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.626
-That's how he did it.
-What?

29:12.709 --> 29:15.584
-This sailor's one of Teddy's people.
-You had a run-in?

29:15.667 --> 29:18.459
Yeah. He's the one who attacked us
when Grace was in labor.

29:27.709 --> 29:29.792
-There's no way out here.
-We'll find a way.

29:29.876 --> 29:31.292
We had one back there!

29:31.375 --> 29:33.999
You know, whatever you had to prove,
you have proved it.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.125
-This is why she asked for you.
-What?

29:43.209 --> 29:47.000
Alicia didn't send the message to me.
She meant it for you. Now I know why.

29:47.501 --> 29:49.292
Because you'll do things
that I won't.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.167
What are you doing?

30:02.542 --> 30:06.000
You didn't want any of us to die?
You're gonna get your wish.

30:14.209 --> 30:15.626
Victor!

30:38.667 --> 30:40.834
Drop the axe. Slide it to me.

30:48.792 --> 30:50.083
You're with him.

30:50.167 --> 30:52.667
-Of course you are.
-Gave me something you couldn't.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.959
Don't do this,
the mistake you made with John.

30:56.167 --> 30:58.000
I don't think it's a mistake.

30:59.042 --> 31:00.959
And you're not gonna change my mind.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.792
-Especially after what you just did.
-I don't understand.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.792
You don't, but you need to.

31:07.667 --> 31:08.999
So do your people.

31:11.626 --> 31:13.999
Whoever's out there,
whoever can hear me,

31:14.042 --> 31:15.584
I need you to listen.

31:15.667 --> 31:18.167
<i>I want you to hear
why you're not gonna stop this.</i>

31:18.250 --> 31:21.751
I saved Morgan so that
he could free me from my sister,

31:21.834 --> 31:23.125
give me a fresh start.

31:23.959 --> 31:26.125
June, she did the first part.

31:27.167 --> 31:29.709
<i>Second part was something else.</i>

31:31.083 --> 31:34.876
If I lived with you, I'd have to be
a whole different person.

31:35.459 --> 31:38.375
<i>I'd have to fall in to the ways
of what Morgan wants.</i>

31:38.459 --> 31:39.792
<i>All of you did.</i>

31:39.876 --> 31:42.626
But it's never gonna work
Morgan's way,

31:43.083 --> 31:46.000
because what he's going for,
none of you even believe it.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.417
That's not true.

31:47.501 --> 31:50.000
You want to be the type of person
he wants you to be?

31:53.417 --> 31:56.626
No, you don't. And that's
why you killed him, right, Victor?

31:58.375 --> 32:02.250
<i>It is because of people like you
that the world has to end.</i>

32:02.334 --> 32:03.792
Don't listen to her.

32:04.417 --> 32:08.042
Right before I shot John,
he told me it wasn't too late,

32:08.125 --> 32:10.042
that the world
still had to have meaning.

32:10.584 --> 32:11.918
He was right.

32:11.999 --> 32:15.042
I am gonna make it mean something,
just not the way he thought.

32:15.125 --> 32:17.542
Dakota, don't do this.
He's gonna kill everyone.

32:19.667 --> 32:21.834
He's not, actually.

32:21.918 --> 32:23.209
Alicia...

32:24.209 --> 32:27.375
she's still gonna be here,
because she is a beginning.

32:27.459 --> 32:30.250
Me and you, we're endings.

32:31.375 --> 32:35.918
And when things start again,
it won't be with assholes like you.

33:13.792 --> 33:17.584
You said this wasn't on me,
but I gave him the key.

33:19.751 --> 33:21.792
I did it to save Grace and her baby.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.042
I can't let that be for nothing.

33:28.334 --> 33:31.209
Grace, I'm here and I'm alright.

33:33.292 --> 33:34.751
I'm here, Morgan.

33:36.250 --> 33:37.584
This ends now.

33:43.042 --> 33:44.667
-Morgan--
-I don't want to hear it.

33:44.751 --> 33:47.042
We will deal with what you did later.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.042
You have already cost us enough time.

33:54.542 --> 33:55.876
Here.

34:08.999 --> 34:11.792
-How we looking, Riley?
-Two minutes.

34:13.042 --> 34:14.918
I stopped something like this once.

34:14.999 --> 34:17.417
-They don't have what it takes.
-I'm glad you did.

34:17.501 --> 34:21.083
Your family returned to the earth,
and now, finally, you can, too.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.709
We'd be lost without you, boy.

34:28.417 --> 34:29.751
Sioux?

34:32.042 --> 34:33.375
Sioux?

34:42.999 --> 34:44.501
Hurry.

34:49.584 --> 34:51.375
What makes you think
one of these is it?

34:53.125 --> 34:55.542
I pulled them off the bodies
of dead officers,

34:56.250 --> 34:57.584
where you left me.

34:59.834 --> 35:01.292
So my instincts were correct.

35:01.375 --> 35:03.542
If I hadn't left you,
you wouldn't have cards.

35:03.626 --> 35:05.709
-You would have no way to--
-You need to stop.

35:15.999 --> 35:17.334
-On three.
-Copy.

35:31.918 --> 35:33.209
One.

35:33.292 --> 35:35.209
You better pray this last one works.

35:39.209 --> 35:40.542
Two.

35:43.751 --> 35:45.125
Three.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.375
The trigger! Pull it!

35:57.000 --> 35:59.584
-No!
-Hey! Stop!

36:01.792 --> 36:03.167
Stop them!

36:03.792 --> 36:05.417
Stop them!

36:05.501 --> 36:06.959
We can't!

36:07.000 --> 36:08.751
I told you it was inevitable.

36:10.501 --> 36:12.167
-Hold it!
-Got it!

36:12.792 --> 36:14.751
-Hold on. Hold on.
-Yeah, hold on.

36:15.626 --> 36:18.375
Grace. We have to go.

36:18.459 --> 36:19.876
I can't leave him.

36:19.959 --> 36:21.959
Morgan! Morgan!

36:49.667 --> 36:50.999
Shit on a stick.

36:52.834 --> 36:54.501
That's a big stick.

37:13.334 --> 37:14.751
Don't!

37:15.292 --> 37:18.375
-It's alright, Riley. It's alright.
-We only got one off.

37:18.459 --> 37:21.834
That's enough to get us started.
We have begun!

37:22.792 --> 37:24.083
How much time do we have?

37:26.042 --> 37:27.999
-How much?
-Not enough!

37:30.918 --> 37:32.709
The missile, where's it going?

37:32.792 --> 37:34.959
Riley, would you like to tell
these gentlemen

37:35.000 --> 37:37.209
what targets you programmed?

37:38.334 --> 37:40.667
There are ten warheads
on that missile.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.125
You'll see where they land.

37:43.667 --> 37:45.709
It's gonna be hard to miss
around here.

37:47.125 --> 37:49.125
-Where?
-Anywhere. Everywhere.

37:49.209 --> 37:51.667
Maybe toward the water. Maybe...

37:53.584 --> 37:55.626
Maybe toward that town you built.

37:59.125 --> 38:00.667
I've been where you are, Morgan.

38:01.334 --> 38:04.834
Yeah. A long time ago,
I was gonna change everything.

38:05.250 --> 38:08.042
A prison sentence put an end to that.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.751
What I didn't realize,
however, was that it...

38:12.417 --> 38:14.167
it didn't really end...

38:15.709 --> 38:17.000
anything.

38:19.334 --> 38:21.083
I know it's not what you wanted,

38:21.834 --> 38:25.250
but don't look at this as an ending.

38:26.334 --> 38:29.834
The world is gonna be a better place.

38:31.626 --> 38:33.709
You just won't get
to see it yourself.

38:45.999 --> 38:47.292
Get out of here.

38:49.876 --> 38:51.459
Go.

38:52.292 --> 38:53.626
Come on.

38:54.459 --> 38:56.876
Strand... let him go.

39:19.667 --> 39:22.250
It could have been worse.
They could have fired more.

39:22.334 --> 39:25.083
Could have launched none
if I'd gotten here sooner.

39:27.334 --> 39:29.125
I did what I did to save lives.

39:29.209 --> 39:31.292
You didn't do this
for anybody but yourself.

39:31.375 --> 39:34.959
You did it so you could tell Alicia
what a big hero you were here today.

39:40.250 --> 39:41.584
Leave.
