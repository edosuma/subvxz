{\an8}- SHE COMING OUT OR WHAT?

15:39.813 --> 15:40.898
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.358
{\an8}- J?

15:42.441 --> 15:43.776
{\an8}- I WON'T DO THAT OVER THERE.

15:43.859 --> 15:44.943
{\an8}AS BEAUTIFUL
AS I THINK SHE IS,

15:45.027 --> 15:46.904
{\an8}KNOWING THAT SHE
HAS A SWARM OF GUYS

15:46.987 --> 15:48.822
{\an8}SURROUNDING HER
DOESN'T MAKE ME WANT

15:48.906 --> 15:50.240
{\an8}TO CALL HER AGAIN.

15:50.324 --> 15:50.866
{\an8}[groans]
- OKAY.

15:50.949 --> 15:52.618
{\an8}YOU OUT?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.037
{\an8}- YOU SURE YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.413
{\an8}- I JUST WANT
TO KNOW WHY HE LEFT.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.164
{\an8}- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.957
{\an8}YOU NEED TO SALVAGE THAT.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.210
{\an8}SALVAGE THAT AND GIVE IT IN
WITH YOUR GIRL.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.670
{\an8}- NO, SHE CAN GET IT
IN WITH YOU.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.879
{\an8}- NO, NO, WE ALL COULD DO--

16:03.962 --> 16:06.256
{\an8}WE ALL CAN HAVE FUN
OR WHATEVER.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.675
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.509
{\an8}- I'LL PICK HER UP
IN THE MORNING.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.551
{\an8}YOU HAVE FUN.
- ALL RIGHT.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.386
{\an8}I'LL HAVE FUN WITH HER.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.722
{\an8}SAYONARA.

16:13.806 --> 16:14.682
{\an8}SHE WAS A HATING FRIEND, YO.

16:14.765 --> 16:18.602
{\an8}- YEAH.
HE WAS RIGHT.

17:06.608 --> 17:07.901
{\an8}- LOOK AT ME.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.153
{\an8}YOU DON'T DESERVE
TO BE PUNISHED.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.113
{\an8}YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

17:11.195 --> 17:14.407
{\an8}RON, I UNDERSTAND.
LISTEN.

17:14.491 --> 17:15.451
{\an8}WE ALL UNDERSTAND.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.077
{\an8}THOUGH THE OTHER DAY,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.621
{\an8}YOU PUT ME IN THE CORNER
[bleep] POSITION

17:19.704 --> 17:22.290
{\an8}AND SHE BEGGED AND BEGGED
AND BEGGED AND BEGGED

17:22.374 --> 17:25.752
{\an8}FOR US TO TELL HER THE TRUTH,
SO WE TOLD HER THE TRUTH.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.672
{\an8}BUT WE TOLD HER THE TRUTH
FOR HER TO LEAVE.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.636
{\an8}I NEVER KNEW
IN A MILLION YEARS

17:34.720 --> 17:36.680
{\an8}I'D EVER GET IN A FIGHT
WITH HER.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.188
{\an8}'CAUSE THE MOMENT YOU WALKED
IN THAT DOOR LAST YEAR--

17:52.905 --> 17:55.407
{\an8}AND YOU'LL TAKE THAT.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.202
{\an8}YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS ANYMORE.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.416
{\an8}- I LEARNED MY LESSON.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.253
{\an8}IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE,
CARE ABOUT SOMEONE--

18:15.761 --> 18:17.387
{\an8}- OH, GOD.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.681

{\an8}- SERIOUSLY, BRO,

18:23.268 --> 18:25.479
{\an8}- DUDE, YOU HAVEN'T

18:25.562 --> 18:26.730
{\an8}- I HAVEN'T DONE [bleep].

18:26.814 --> 18:28.065
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU, BRO.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.192
{\an8}- I'M SORRY, LIKE,

18:30.275 --> 18:32.778
{\an8}- AND I'M SORRY.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.359
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.568

21:40.215 --> 21:41.717
{\an8}SAM JUST HIT--
SAM JUST HIT HIM.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.885
{\an8}- SHE LITERALLY JUST
SNUFFED ME IN MY FACE.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.429
{\an8}LIKE, JUST CRACKED ME
IN MY JAW.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.139
{\an8}- AND SHE'S UPSTAIRS.
LIKE, THE CHICK'S UPSTAIRS.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.265
{\an8}- THE LAST PERSON
SHE HAD IN THIS HOUSE,

21:48.348 --> 21:49.349
{\an8}SHE JUST PUSHED AWAY.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.559
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
GIVE ME A HUG.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.476
{\an8}I GOT YOUR BACK.
YOU KNOW I DO, ALL RIGHT?

21:51.560 --> 21:55.230
{\an8}- SAM, SERIOUSLY, DUDE.
LOOK AT YOU.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.607
{\an8}- THIS IS--
THIS IS GOD TELLING ME TO GO.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.192
{\an8}- NO.
THIS IS NOT GOD.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.902
{\an8}GOD ISN'T YOUR EGO.

22:00.986 --> 22:03.405
{\an8}- HE'S FRIENDS WITH JENNI.
- WHO CARES?

22:03.488 --> 22:05.157
{\an8}- I DO, VIN!

22:05.240 --> 22:08.910
{\an8}- SAMMI'S EGO
IS LIKE A BRICK WALL.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.162
{\an8}THERE'S NO GETTING THROUGH
TO SAMMI

22:10.245 --> 22:11.455
{\an8}WHEN SHE'S BEING STUBBORN.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.414
{\an8}YOU'RE ACTING LIKE ANGELINA.
- LOOK AT ME.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.249
{\an8}I PUNCHED A KID
IN THE [bleep] FACE.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.792
{\an8}- YOU'RE LIKE ANGELINA
RIGHT NOW.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.253
{\an8}- BECAUSE HE'S A [bleep].
I CAN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

22:18.336 --> 22:20.756
{\an8}I CAN'T DO IT.
I'M LEAVING.

22:20.839 --> 22:23.091
{\an8}MY MOM'S ON HER WAY
AND THAT'S IT.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.384
{\an8}I'M OUT.
- DON'T--YOU CAN'T--

22:24.468 --> 22:25.469
{\an8}YOU CAN'T LEAVE, SAM.

22:25.552 --> 22:26.553
{\an8}YOU STILL HAVE FRIENDS
IN THIS HOUSE.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.596
{\an8}- I CAN'T STAY HERE.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.889
{\an8}- YOU STILL HAVE FRIENDS
IN THIS HOUSE.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.474
{\an8}- AFTER EVERYTHING
I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

22:30.557 --> 22:33.143
{\an8}I PERSONALLY CAN'T BE FRIENDS
WITH THAT GIRL JENNI.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.062
{\an8}HE TALKED SO MUCH [bleep]
AND EVERYTHING--

22:35.145 --> 22:36.354
{\an8}- DON'T BE FRIENDS.
- SAM, I LOVE YOU!

22:36.438 --> 22:38.065
{\an8}- AND HE GOES
AND BE FRIENDS WITH HER?

22:38.148 --> 22:39.524
{\an8}GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE!

22:39.608 --> 22:41.818
{\an8}THAT'S THE FAKEST [bleep]
THAT I'VE EVER MET

22:41.902 --> 22:44.321
{\an8}IN MY ENTIRE LIFE
THAT'S FAKE.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.947
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE HER STAY,

22:46.031 --> 22:47.199
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:47.282 --> 22:49.618
{\an8}IF SHE STAYS, I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE HER LIFE MISERABLE.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.079
{\an8}SHE GOT NO [bleep] IDEA.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.831
{\an8}I HAD SYMPATHY
FOR HER IN MIAMI.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.792
{\an8}- I WANT TO GO.
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.085
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.
- I KNOW YOU WANT TO GO.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.462
{\an8}- HOW CAN I ENJOY MY LIFE
LIVING WITH AN EX-BOYFRIEND

23:00.545 --> 23:01.671
{\an8}WHO YOU STILL CARE ABOUT?

23:01.755 --> 23:03.298
{\an8}TELL ME.
- OKAY.

23:03.381 --> 23:03.965
{\an8}'CAUSE YOU NEED SUCKY THINGS
IN LIFE TO MAKE YOU STRONGER.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.176
{\an8}AND YOU NEED US.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.344
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA TIE YOU DOWN
TO THE BED.

23:07.427 --> 23:08.345
{\an8}I'M SORRY.
- IT'S RUINED.

23:08.428 --> 23:11.056
{\an8}I'M MISERABLE HERE.
- SAM, GOOD.

23:11.139 --> 23:12.057
{\an8}BE MISERABLE,
BUT YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

23:12.140 --> 23:12.974
{\an8}- I CAN'T.
- YES, YOU CAN.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.392
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT, SAM?

23:14.476 --> 23:16.728
{\an8}I THINK YOU'RE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE AND--

23:16.812 --> 23:18.230
{\an8}- SHE'S NOT MAKING A MISTAKE.
SHE'S NOT DOING IT.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.064
{\an8}- I NEED TO GO.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.359
{\an8}THIS ISN'T FOR ME ANYMORE.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.819
{\an8}I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR
WHAT ANYBODY HAD TO SAY.

23:23.902 --> 23:24.945
{\an8}LIKE, I WANT TO GO.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.863
{\an8}AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE OVER
THERE WERE, LIKE,

23:26.947 --> 23:28.615
{\an8}SAYING SOME NICE,
CONSOLING THINGS.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.910
{\an8}EVEN THOUGH I JUST PUNCHED ONE
OF THEIR ROOMMATES IN THE FACE,

23:31.993 --> 23:33.453
{\an8}THEY WERE UP THERE TRYING
TO HELP ME OUT

23:33.537 --> 23:35.580
{\an8}AND I DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.749
{\an8}I GET IT, BUT, LIKE,
AT THIS POINT,

23:37.833 --> 23:39.000
{\an8}IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.252
{\an8}- YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LEAVE?

23:40.335 --> 23:44.005
{\an8}YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LEAVE, SAM?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.894
{\an8}[dog barks]

23:59.938 --> 24:01.231
{\an8}- SHH.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.858
{\an8}- I WANT TO PLAY WITH THE DOG.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.359
{\an8}- SHE HATES YOU.

24:04.442 --> 24:07.404
{\an8}- I'LL TEACH HIM HOW TO PIMP.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.072
{\an8}- IT'S A GIRL.
- IT'S A GIRL.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.407
{\an8}- MY BAD.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.908
{\an8}[dog barks]

24:11.992 --> 24:12.909
{\an8}WANT A MEATBALL?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.870
{\an8}[laughter]

24:14.953 --> 24:17.205
{\an8}[dog barks]

24:17.289 --> 24:18.707
{\an8}- GOD, BELLA, SHUT UP.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.042
{\an8}I NEED HER TO SHUT
THE OTHER ONE UP,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.210
{\an8}SO I CAN GET IT IN.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.420
{\an8}I KNOW SHE DOES, BUT I NEED--

24:23.503 --> 24:24.880
{\an8}- WAIT.
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SEX?

24:24.963 --> 24:26.173
{\an8}- SHH!

24:26.256 --> 24:27.465
{\an8}- CAN I HAVE THE DOG
IN MY BED?

24:27.549 --> 24:30.302
{\an8}- NO, 'CAUSE THEN
THE OTHER ONE BARKS.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.720
{\an8}ORIGINALLY, I THOUGHT ROGER
COULD MAYBE BE, LIKE,

24:31.803 --> 24:33.889
{\an8}A REBOUND FOR TOM AND I NEVER
THOUGHT IN A MILLION YEARS

24:33.972 --> 24:36.808
{\an8}THAT I'D ACTUALLY SLEEP
WITH HIM THIS QUICK.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.518
{\an8}BUT I'M REALLY DEVELOPING
FEELINGS FOR THE KID.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.063
{\an8}LIKE, HE'S EVERYTHING
I WANT IN A GUY.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.274
{\an8}SO WHY NOT?

24:44.357 --> 24:47.402
{\an8}[dogs barking]

24:49.154 --> 24:53.575
{\an8}- WHAT GOES ON
IN THE JERSEY SHORE HOUSE

24:53.658 --> 24:54.826
{\an8}WHAT GOES ON

24:54.910 --> 24:57.579
{\an8}- [chuckles]

24:57.662 --> 24:59.289
{\an8}IT'S 7:00.
I'M GOING HOME.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.958
{\an8}- WHERE'S YOUR MOM AT?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.877
{\an8}- SHE'LL BE ON HER WAY.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.837
{\an8}- THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE LONGEST NIGHT

25:05.921 --> 25:08.423
{\an8}HERE AT THE JERSEY SHORE HOUSE
IN A VERY LONG TIME.

25:08.506 --> 25:11.676
{\an8}- HOW AM I GONNA SPOON
MY BEST FRIEND?

25:11.760 --> 25:15.805
{\an8}- DO YOU AND RYDER
WANT TO SLEEP IN MY BED?

25:15.889 --> 25:18.558
{\an8}- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

25:18.642 --> 25:19.434
{\an8}- SHE WANTS TO LEAVE.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

25:19.517 --> 25:21.561
{\an8}- YEAH.
- 'CAUSE WITHOUT YOU,

25:21.645 --> 25:23.688
{\an8}SHE HAS NOBODY.
- SHH. HERE SHE COMES.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.950
{\an8}- I'M SORRY I PUNCHED YOU
IN THE FACE.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.284
{\an8}TRULY SORRY.

25:36.368 --> 25:41.122
{\an8}UM, I FEEL EXTREMELY HURT...

25:41.206 --> 25:44.626
{\an8}THAT YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH JENNI AFTER EVERYTHING.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.129
{\an8}- SHOULD WE LET THEM BE ALONE?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

25:48.213 --> 25:52.884
{\an8}I DON'T LIKE JENNI, AND I'M HURT
THAT YOU WOULD BEFRIEND HER.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.636
{\an8}NO?

25:54.719 --> 25:58.390
{\an8}YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCEPT
MY APOLOGY THIS TIME.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.684
{\an8}BUT BEFORE I LEAVE HERE,
YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW I FEEL.

26:00.767 --> 26:04.521
{\an8}THIS IS MY FINAL GOOD-BYE
TO YOU, SO, UM...

26:04.604 --> 26:08.358
{\an8}YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

26:11.069 --> 26:14.489
{\an8}REALLY? OKAY.

26:24.541 --> 26:28.420
{\an8}- WHAT DO I DO, BRO?
- LET HER GO, BRO.

26:28.503 --> 26:32.674
{\an8}RIGHT NOW, YOU NEED TO
DO WHAT'S BEST FOR RONNIE.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.758
{\an8}EVERYTHING ELSE WILL
FALL IN PLACE, DAWG.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.010
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

26:35.093 --> 26:36.386
{\an8}YOU'RE A BIG MAN.
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

26:36.469 --> 26:38.888
{\an8}- IT'S HARD THOUGH, BRO.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.081
{\an8}- I'M SORRY.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.753
{\an8}WILL YOU GO INSIDE WITH ME,
PLEASE? FOR THE LAST TIME?

27:18.470 --> 27:21.389
{\an8}CAN I HUG YOU GOOD-BYE?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.934
{\an8}NO?

27:25.018 --> 27:28.355
{\an8}CAN I?

27:59.344 --> 28:02.722
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE I OWE RON
AN EXTREME APOLOGY.

28:02.806 --> 28:03.848
{\an8}PUNCHING RON IN THE FACE,

28:03.932 --> 28:06.267
{\an8}GETTING UPSET THAT HE WAS
TALKING TO JENNI--

28:06.351 --> 28:08.937
{\an8}THAT WAS A BAD THING.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.771
{\an8}WHAT AM I DOING?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.815
{\an8}I'M WASTING TIME
HATING SOMEBODY

28:11.898 --> 28:14.025
{\an8}WHEN IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.653
{\an8}IT'S NOT WORTH--LIKE,
LOOK WHAT I'M DOING TO MYSELF.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.449
{\an8}IT'S NOT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.827
{\an8}IT'S ABOUT JENNI THAT MADE ME
PUNCH RON IN THE FACE.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.121
{\an8}NOTHING TO DO WITH ME AND RON
OR THE FIGHT.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.455
{\an8}IT WAS THE WHOLE JENNI THING.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.874
{\an8}AND IT'S DISGUSTING THAT
I TOOK IT TO THAT LEVEL.

28:46.057 --> 28:47.475
{\an8}I'M GONNA TAKE IT
DAY BY DAY

28:47.559 --> 28:51.271
{\an8}AND WORK ON THE RELATIONSHIP
WITH RON, MY BOYFRIEND.

28:51.354 --> 28:53.773
{\an8}BUT ALSO WITH EVERYBODY
IN THIS HOUSE, INCLUDING JENNI.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.592
{\an8}- HELLO?
- HELLO.

29:20.675 --> 29:22.510
{\an8}I CALL MY MOM. I TELL HER
THAT EVERYTHING'S FINE,

29:22.594 --> 29:23.845
{\an8}AND I'M STAYING IN SEASIDE.

29:23.928 --> 29:26.848
{\an8}- IT WAS A BAD DAY, HUH?
- YEAH.

29:26.931 --> 29:30.560
{\an8}I PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE.
MOM, I PUNCHED HIM IN THE FACE.

29:30.643 --> 29:31.644
{\an8}- RON?

29:31.728 --> 29:32.645
{\an8}- YEP.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.482
{\an8}- ARE YOU BROKEN UP
WITH HIM?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.192
{\an8}- WELL, I PUNCHED HIM
IN THE FACE,

29:37.275 --> 29:39.903
{\an8}SO THAT'S KINDA LIKE
NOT OKAY.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.070
{\an8}- WELL, YOU CAN'T GO
ANY LOWER--THAT'S IT.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.531
{\an8}TIME TO PICK YOUR--
- PICK UP YOUR LIFE, HUH?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.366
{\an8}- THAT'S IT, PICK IT UP
AND MOVE UP NOW,

29:45.450 --> 29:46.367
{\an8}AND GET YOURSELF HAPPY.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.535
{\an8}YOU'VE GOTTA START
DOING FUN THINGS

29:47.619 --> 29:48.495
{\an8}AND BEING HAPPY.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.830
{\an8}- I KNOW. YOU'RE RIGHT.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.548
{\an8}- I LOVE YOU.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.384
{\an8}- BYE.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.179
{\an8}LOVE YOU.

{\an8}AND GOOD PEOPLE.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.245
{\an8}AND I'M HAPPY I'M HERE.
- SALUD!

30:30.328 --> 30:33.665
{\an8}- I THINK SAMMI'S MATURING,
AND SHE'S REALIZING THAT

30:33.748 --> 30:34.874
{\an8}SHE'S BEEN WRONG.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.253
{\an8}AND SHE'S FINALLY LOOKING
OUTSIDE THE BOX,

30:38.336 --> 30:40.421
{\an8}INSTEAD OF BEING STUBBORN
AND HARDHEADED.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.719
{\an8}- IT'S DATE NIGHT, RIGHT?

30:46.803 --> 30:48.388
{\an8}SO IT'S, LIKE,
THIS DATE NIGHT,

30:48.471 --> 30:50.265
{\an8}AND JENNI'S GOING OUT
WITH HER BOY ROGER.

30:50.348 --> 30:54.102
{\an8}AND DEENA'S GOING OUT WITH
THE RONNIE LOOK-ALIKE, DEAN.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.395
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT LOOKS LIKE RONNIE.

30:55.478 --> 30:58.106
{\an8}- NO, WHEN HE WAS DANCING,
HE WAS, LIKE...

30:58.189 --> 30:59.315
{\an8}- EWW!
- LIKE RONNIE DOES.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.985
{\an8}- HE PROBABLY STUDIES
RONNIE'S EVERY MOVE.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.444
{\an8}AND THEN HE'S, LIKE,
"I WANT TO BE RON."

31:03.528 --> 31:06.739
{\an8}- OOH, STOP IT.

31:13.621 --> 31:15.331
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]
- THIS IS GREAT.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.874
{\an8}- I'D LIKE TO SAY HERE'S
TO YOU TWO

31:16.958 --> 31:19.669
{\an8}BAILING ME AND DEAN
OUT OF JAIL TONIGHT.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.922
{\an8}- TO DOING SOMETHING DUMB.
- WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:23.006 --> 31:24.382
{\an8}- WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
WHAT IT HAPPENS.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.175
{\an8}- THAT WASN'T A GOOD "CHEERS."

31:26.259 --> 31:27.594
{\an8}[laughter]

31:31.097 --> 31:33.141
{\an8}- IT'S ONLY OUR SECOND DATE.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.643
{\an8}I THINK TONIGHT WE SHOULD
JUST KEEP IT CLASSY.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.769
{\an8}WE'LL GO ON RIDES,
EVERYTHING.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.687
{\an8}- LISTEN, JUST THROW
THAT FIRST LINE

31:37.770 --> 31:38.771
{\an8}OUT THE WINDOW RIGHT NOW.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.024
{\an8}KEEP IT CLASSY?
YOU SERIOUS?

31:46.112 --> 31:47.030
{\an8}- VINNY!

31:47.113 --> 31:48.489
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

31:48.573 --> 31:50.992
{\an8}- I'LL DO WHATEVER. I JUST
DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.202
{\an8}- I WANT TO HANG OUT WITH NICOLE
SO SHE'S NOT LEFT OUT.

31:53.286 --> 31:55.038
{\an8}AND INSTEAD OF GOING
TO DINNER,

31:55.121 --> 31:55.997
{\an8}WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE EXCITING.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.421
{\an8}OH, THESE ARE DOPE!

32:03.504 --> 32:05.131
{\an8}- HOW MUCH IS THE STRIPPER POLE?

32:05.214 --> 32:07.091
{\an8}- $230.
- I'LL GET IT.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.219
{\an8}- NICOLE HAS THIS IDEA TO BUY
A STRIPPER POLE FOR THE HOUSE,

32:10.303 --> 32:11.262
{\an8}AND I WANT THE [bleep]
STRIPPER POLE.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.680
{\an8}- IT DOESN'T COME UP
"STRIPPER POLE"

32:12.764 --> 32:13.931
{\an8}ON MY CREDIT CARD, RIGHT?

32:14.015 --> 32:15.808
{\an8}MY DAD WILL BE, LIKE,
WHAT THE [bleep]?

32:15.892 --> 32:17.143
{\an8}- THIS HOUSE NEEDS
A STRIPPER POLE.

32:21.105 --> 32:23.858
{\an8}- COOL.
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS.

32:23.941 --> 32:24.484
{\an8}- IT IS LIKE CHRISTMAS.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.528
{\an8}- IS IT TALL ENOUGH?

32:27.612 --> 32:31.908
{\an8}- OH...NOW WHAT?

32:31.991 --> 32:34.202
{\an8}[laughter]

32:34.285 --> 32:36.245
{\an8}WHAT ABOUT RIGHT THERE
IN THAT DOORWAY?

32:36.329 --> 32:38.748
{\an8}- OH--
- OH, THIS MIGHT WORK.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.583
{\an8}- PUTTING IT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE KITCHEN?

32:40.667 --> 32:41.125
{\an8}TRY AND SWING ON IT.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.089
{\an8}[laughter]

32:46.172 --> 32:47.215
{\an8}- IT WORKS.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.883
{\an8}- YOU GOTTA SCREW IT
INTO THE GROUND THOUGH.

32:48.966 --> 32:52.428
{\an8}- OH, YEAH, THIS IS GONNA--
YEAH.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.429
{\an8}- WE GOTTA SCREW IT
TO THE GROUND.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.765
{\an8}YEAH, BUDDY.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.225
{\an8}THAT'S THE FIRST THING I SAID
WHEN I WALKED

32:57.308 --> 32:58.393
{\an8}THROUGH THE DOOR
IN THIS HOUSE--

32:58.476 --> 32:59.519
{\an8}I WAS, LIKE, "ALL I NEED
IS A STRIPPER POLE."

32:59.602 --> 33:00.603
{\an8}HONESTLY, BRO,

33:00.687 --> 33:02.730
{\an8}IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THIS.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.065
{\an8}UNLESS WE HAD
A STRIPPER POLE,

33:04.148 --> 33:05.233
{\an8}LIKE, RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE ROOM.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.652
{\an8}AND NOW I HAVE IT.
SO WE'RE GOOD.

33:07.735 --> 33:08.277
{\an8}- YO, THAT'S THE SAME ONE
I GOT IN MY ROOM.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.362
{\an8}- YEAH!

33:09.445 --> 33:13.741
{\an8}- OH, PAULY...

33:13.825 --> 33:16.411
{\an8}- IT'S NOT THAT STURDY. LIKE,
NO FAT GIRLS CAN GO ON IT.

33:16.494 --> 33:19.205
{\an8}BUT IT WOULD BE
PRETTY FUNNY.

33:19.288 --> 33:21.749
{\an8}[laughter]

33:25.503 --> 33:26.838
{\an8}- I'M GOING TO GET
A HAIRCUT.

33:26.921 --> 33:31.175
{\an8}- BARBER SHOP.
BARBER SHOP.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.218
{\an8}- YOU READY FOR YOUR
HAIRCUT, LITTLE MAN?

33:32.301 --> 33:34.595
{\an8}- YEAH, BUDDY
IT'S TOO QUIET IN HERE.

33:34.679 --> 33:36.764
{\an8}- WE'RE CUTTING THE TOP, RIGHT?
- YEAH, A LITTLE TRIM.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.851
{\an8}- YO, P, WHEN RONNIE'S
STUNT DOUBLE COMES IN,

33:39.934 --> 33:40.309
{\an8}DOES HE ASK FOR THE SAME CUT
AS MY DUDE?

33:40.393 --> 33:42.478
{\an8}- YEAH.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.021
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

33:44.105 --> 33:44.772
{\an8}HE SAID SHE WANTED
TO [bleep] HIS ASS,

33:44.856 --> 33:46.941
{\an8}AND HE WASN'T ABOUT IT.

33:47.024 --> 33:48.901
{\an8}[laughter]
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT?

33:48.985 --> 33:52.155
{\an8}- ONE OF THE BARBERS SAYS
THAT DEAN, DEENA'S MAN,

33:52.238 --> 33:54.866
{\an8}ANNOUNCED THAT
DEENA LIKES TO...

33:54.949 --> 33:57.076
{\an8}YOU KNOW...

33:57.160 --> 33:59.078
{\an8}- SO SHE WANTED TO,
OR HE WANTED HER?

33:59.162 --> 34:03.124
{\an8}- NO, SHE WANTED TO.
- OH, SHE WANTED TO.

34:03.207 --> 34:07.795
{\an8}- DEENA...

34:07.879 --> 34:11.799
{\an8}I CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.341
{\an8}- YO, DID HE ASK HER WHY
SHE DID THAT?

34:12.425 --> 34:14.217
{\an8}[laughter]

34:14.302 --> 34:19.599
{\an8}- 'CAUSE HE SAID IT WAS
CLEANED OUT IN THE JACUZZI.

34:19.681 --> 34:22.310
{\an8}- [chuckles]
OKAY.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.686
{\an8}- IF ANYTHING,
IT MAKES IT WORSE.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.646
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
I'D SHARE A DRINK WITH DEENA,

34:25.730 --> 34:26.981
{\an8}OR A CIGARETTE WITH DEENA,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.815
{\an8}OR ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO
WITH TOUCHING DEENA'S LIPS

34:28.900 --> 34:29.984
{\an8}IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.489
{\an8}- DAMN, THAT'S A GOOD STORY
RIGHT THERE.

34:43.915 --> 34:48.503
{\an8}I HEARD A STORY
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

34:48.585 --> 34:52.632
{\an8}- WAS IT GOOD OR BAD?
- IT'S IN THE MIDDLE.

34:52.715 --> 34:55.342
{\an8}IT WAS, LIKE, A BARBER SHOP
DUDE STORY.

34:55.426 --> 34:58.513
{\an8}- SOMETHING ABOUT, LIKE,
SEX OR SOMETHING?

34:58.596 --> 34:59.222
{\an8}- SOMETHING AROUND
THOSE LINES.

35:07.105 --> 35:11.818
{\an8}- I HEARD A STORY
ABOUT YOU TODAY.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.862
{\an8}YOU WANT TO WALK
ON THE TREADMILL WITH ME?

35:14.946 --> 35:16.739
{\an8}- AND YOU'LL TELL ME?
- I'LL TELL YOU.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.865
{\an8}I REALLY COULDN'T
CONTROL MYSELF.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.493
{\an8}THIS TYPE OF JUICY INFORMATION
NEEDS TO BE,

35:20.576 --> 35:21.577
{\an8}YOU KNOW,
BROUGHT OUT IMMEDIATELY.

35:21.661 --> 35:25.081
{\an8}- I HAVE NOT HOOKED UP
WITH ANYONE AROUND HERE.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.874
{\an8}- WELL, WHO DID YOU
HOOK UP WITH?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.209
{\an8}- THAT KID DEAN.
- OKAY, SO I GUESS IT HAS--

35:28.292 --> 35:30.670
{\an8}MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

35:30.753 --> 35:32.129
{\an8}IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT YOU LIKE.

35:32.213 --> 35:32.880
{\an8}- THAT I LIKE?
- YEAH.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.132
{\an8}EVERYBODY HAS PREFERENCES.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.259
{\an8}YOU HAPPEN TO LIKE
THIS PARTICULAR PREFERENCE.

35:36.342 --> 35:39.136
{\an8}- I KNOW--I THINK I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

35:39.220 --> 35:40.346
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S COMING BACK
TO ME.

35:40.429 --> 35:41.681
{\an8}- YES, IT DEFINITELY IS
COMING BACK TO YOU.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.767
{\an8}WHEN YOU WERE DRUNK, YOU--
- AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,

35:44.851 --> 35:46.519
{\an8}THEN I THINK I DO
LIKE TO DO THAT.

35:46.602 --> 35:48.479
{\an8}- OH, SO THAT'S REAL GOOD.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.731
{\an8}WELL, LISTEN, IF YOU LIKE
TO DO THAT, GOOD FOR YOU.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.568
{\an8}- WAIT. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:53.651 --> 35:59.073
{\an8}- UM, LET'S JUST SAY
YOU LIKE TO, UM...

35:59.156 --> 36:03.202
{\an8}YOU DON'T LIKE TO,
YOU KNOW, [bleep],

36:03.286 --> 36:05.621
{\an8}BUT YOU LIKE TO [bleep].

36:05.705 --> 36:08.291
{\an8}- WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE
'CAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE.

36:08.374 --> 36:12.753
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER IN MY LIFE
[bleep] A [bleep].

36:12.837 --> 36:14.130
{\an8}LET'S BE REAL.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.965
{\an8}WAS I BEING TALKED ABOUT
AT THE BARBER SHOP?

36:16.048 --> 36:18.134
{\an8}- MM-HMM. YEAH,
AND THEY SAID THAT...

36:18.217 --> 36:20.761
{\an8}HE WANTED YOU
TO [bleep] HIS THING,

36:20.845 --> 36:24.515
{\an8}BUT YOU SAID NO, YOU WILL
[bleep] HIS [bleep].

36:24.599 --> 36:26.267
{\an8}- NO, THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

36:26.350 --> 36:29.604
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER, EVER
[bleep] SOMEONE'S [bleep].

36:29.687 --> 36:32.648
{\an8}I WANT TO GO HOME
AND CALL THAT KID.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.152
{\an8}MY TEETH AND MY MOUTH
IS TOO PRECIOUS TO ME

36:36.235 --> 36:39.405
{\an8}TO GO DOWN THAT WAY.

36:39.488 --> 36:42.867
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT MIKE SAID
THEY SAID AT THE BARBER SHOP?

36:42.950 --> 36:45.953
{\an8}- WHAT?
- THAT I LIKE TO...

36:46.037 --> 36:47.413
{\an8}[bleep].
- WHAT?

36:47.496 --> 36:51.042
{\an8}- THAT'S NOT FUNNY,
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT TRUE.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.002
{\an8}I NEVER WOULD DO THAT
IN MY LIFE.

36:53.085 --> 36:56.213
{\an8}- [laughing]
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

36:56.297 --> 37:00.468
{\an8}- [laughing]

37:00.551 --> 37:02.386
{\an8}- HONESTLY, I'M GONNA FRIKKIN'
RIP HIM A NEW [bleep].

37:06.265 --> 37:08.976
{\an8}I HOPE I SEE THAT
[bleep] GUY TONIGHT.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.394
{\an8}- YEAH, DOWN HERE!

37:25.326 --> 37:26.744
{\an8}- SO AT KARMA, I SEE DEAN,

37:26.827 --> 37:27.954
{\an8}AND I BASICALLY TELL HIM
TO GO [bleep] HIMSELF.

37:28.037 --> 37:30.831
{\an8}LIKE, GET AWAY FROM ME--

37:30.915 --> 37:32.250
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO YOU, IT'S DONE.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.274
{\an8}IT MAKES ME FEEL FANTASTIC

37:57.358 --> 37:58.651
{\an8}TO MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE
A DOUCHE BAG AT THE CLUB.

37:58.734 --> 38:00.736
{\an8}YOU MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A
DOUCHE BAG AT THAT BARBER SHOP?

38:00.820 --> 38:02.196
{\an8}HERE YOU GO, BABY.

38:02.279 --> 38:06.033
{\an8}THIS IS ON YOU.
KARMA'S A BITCH, LITERALLY.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.996
{\an8}YOU'RE AN AMAZING PIECE
OF [bleep].

38:17.169 --> 38:19.672
{\an8}- SO WE'RE AT KARMA,

38:19.755 --> 38:21.382
{\an8}AND WE'RE JUST HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

38:21.465 --> 38:24.719
{\an8}SO BASICALLY I'M, LIKE,
I'M GONNA GO OVER TO RON AND SAM

38:24.802 --> 38:25.970
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW,
SEE WHERE IT GOES.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.275
{\an8}NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS
WOULD I EVER THINK

38:39.358 --> 38:41.569
{\an8}I'D BE THE ONE
TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE

38:41.652 --> 38:42.903
{\an8}TO TALK TO SAMMI,

38:42.987 --> 38:47.366
{\an8}BUT MY MOOD HAS CHANGED
LATELY, AND I'M JUST HAPPY.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.535
{\an8}SO I COULD CARE LESS
ABOUT SMALL [bleep].

39:23.152 --> 39:25.905
{\an8}- I JUST FEEL A LOT BETTER
THAT I'M HERE TALKING TO JENNI

39:25.988 --> 39:28.115
{\an8}AND KIND OF JUST, LIKE--

39:28.199 --> 39:28.991
{\an8}KIND OF BEING MATURE
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

39:29.075 --> 39:31.410
{\an8}AND PUTTING IT BEHIND US.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.461
{\an8}- THE DRAMA BETWEEN
ME, SAM, AND RON HAS GONE ON

39:40.544 --> 39:43.589
{\an8}WAY TOO LONG,
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE

39:43.672 --> 39:46.509
{\an8}THE HOUSE, AS A WHOLE,
WILL HAVE A BETTER VIBE.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.594
{\an8}- I WAS MAD AT JENNI
FOR A LOT OF WRONG REASONS.

39:48.677 --> 39:52.056
{\an8}AND BEING ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD
MAKES ME FEEL HAPPY.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.975
{\an8}BUT WHEN IT COMES TO RON,

39:55.059 --> 39:58.020
{\an8}LET'S TAKE THIS DAY BY DAY,
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
