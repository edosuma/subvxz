00:23.123 --> 00:26.957
Do you have any idea why someone
would wanna kill to stop this race?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.585
Jamie, get down!

00:30.663 --> 00:32.563
Now cancel the race
before it's too late.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.566
They're well-known
crime figures in Detroit.

00:34.634 --> 00:35.931
That's very nice.

00:36.002 --> 00:37.560
The nineteenth hole.

00:37.637 --> 00:39.104
KITT, this is the place...

00:39.172 --> 00:40.935
they bury people
when they get in their way.

00:41.007 --> 00:41.996
Jamie.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.339
Car seven and 12
to the starting line.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.400
Go!

00:46.679 --> 00:48.647
The road up ahead.
What about it?

00:48.715 --> 00:51.149
There's a high voltage wire
stretched across it.

01:05.230 --> 01:09.167
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world...

01:09.235 --> 01:11.931
of a man who does not exist.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.210
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.282 --> 01:24.682
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.751 --> 01:26.946
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.020 --> 01:30.285
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:24.611 --> 02:27.136
It's called
the Marberry Grand Prix.

02:27.213 --> 02:31.673
I don't care what it sounds like.
It's spelled P-R-I-X, not P-R-E-E.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.116
It's French.

02:33.553 --> 02:37.045
What am I supposed to do with
5,000 fly sheets spelled wrong?

02:39.392 --> 02:42.225
Okay, George. Thanks.
I'll see you in half an hour.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.424
P-R-I-X. Right.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.323
She just left.

04:13.620 --> 04:16.111
Michael, you're awfully quiet
this morning.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.548
Just appreciating
the countryside, pal...

04:18.625 --> 04:20.456
just appreciating
the countryside.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.327
Kind of reminds me
of when I was a kid, you know?

04:23.396 --> 04:27.856
Lazy days, green hills,
streams full of catfish...

04:28.534 --> 04:29.660
Mary Lou.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.637
For some reason, I can't
visualize you as a child.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.537
Then again, I can't visualize
myself as one, either.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.576
It's probably
because you never were.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.579
As a child, would I still
have all my functions?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.706
Would I still be able
to turbo boost?

04:42.782 --> 04:47.048
Yeah, but you'd have to start
off small, like maybe over wagons.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.049
Station wagons?
Toy wagons.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.519
In that case, I'm glad I never
had to experience childhood.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.259
Devon's calling.

04:56.529 --> 04:57.894
Yo, Devon.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.390
Hello, Michael.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.831
I see you're not far
from the town of Marberry.

05:01.901 --> 05:03.198
Marberry?

05:03.569 --> 05:05.161
Couldn't prove it by me.
What's up?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.172
The granddaughter
of an old friend of mine...

05:07.240 --> 05:10.232
is the editor-publisher of the local
paper there. I'm way ahead of you.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.245
You want me to drop by and pick up
the latest edition as a keepsake...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.474
because I've been on the road
for three days straight...

05:15.548 --> 05:17.675
and you wouldn't dream of
giving me another assignment.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.980
Michael.
You would.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.714
She's sponsoring
a local event.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.880
For some reason...

05:22.955 --> 05:25.981
she's convinced that someone's
tried to kill her this morning.

05:26.059 --> 05:29.495
It may be nothing, but I'd never
forgive myself if I was wrong.

05:30.229 --> 05:32.094
I'm on my way.
I'll get back to you.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.794
KITT, plot us a course
to Marberry.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.666
Marberry, Michael?
You heard me, Marberry.

05:38.738 --> 05:40.797
And give me whatever you've
got on that little town.

05:40.873 --> 05:41.931
Right away, Michael.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.944
According to my data, Marberry is a
quiet, peaceful retirement community.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.983
Welcome, Benji.
It's been a long time, Joey.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.556
Too long,
my good friend.

06:31.624 --> 06:35.025
Is Mr. C here yet?
No, but soon. Soon.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.096
What's that? They're here
for some kind of race...

06:42.168 --> 06:44.966
but don't worry, Benji.
We're dealing with it.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.060
Hmm.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.571
The nineteenth hole,
old friend?

06:50.209 --> 06:51.836
The nineteenth hole.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.183
Get there first!

07:08.428 --> 07:11.727
A quiet, peaceful
retirement community?

07:14.901 --> 07:17.927
Bonnie meticulously revises
my databanks regularly.

07:18.004 --> 07:20.097
Is it possible
we're in the wrong Marberry?

07:20.173 --> 07:22.198
I don't think so.
It seems to me...

07:22.275 --> 07:24.869
Marberry has changed
its image, partner.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.606
None for the better if you
ask me. Is nothing sacred?

07:27.680 --> 07:31.548
Isn't there anywhere safe from
fast cars and rock and roll?

07:31.617 --> 07:35.212
You tell me. You're the one with
the meticulously revised databanks.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.416
Is that thing blown?
I beg your pardon.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.693
Not now, KITT.
I beg your pardon.

07:41.761 --> 07:44.889
You know, blown
as in supercharged.

07:46.065 --> 07:48.659
Does it matter?
Only if you wanna win.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.099
I'll let you know.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.204
What's that funny,
little red light in front?

07:54.273 --> 07:57.936
That is an automatic garage door opener.

08:00.546 --> 08:02.741
Can you tell me
where I can find the sponsor?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.841
Right over there.
It's winner take all.

08:05.918 --> 08:09.376
In case you're interested, that
was my nickname in high school.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.653
Winner?
All.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.152
The wisdom of youth.

08:21.701 --> 08:24.169
Hi, Daisy.
Bye, Red.

08:28.774 --> 08:30.935
Ain't seen you around before,
dude.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.840
Let's take a look at your
horses. I beg your pardon.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.083
There's more than one way
to open a tin can.

08:48.895 --> 08:50.692
We'll see about that.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.430
Thank you.

08:55.801 --> 08:57.200
Business looks good.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.668
Wanna sign up?
Maybe later.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.566
Are you Jamie Downs?
Yeah. Why?

09:04.143 --> 09:07.977
My name is Michael Knight.
Devon Miles asked me to drop by.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.675
So soon? Thanks.
You're welcome.

09:10.750 --> 09:14.208
Can we maybe
go someplace and talk?

09:15.421 --> 09:17.651
I wasn't expecting you
till later...

09:17.723 --> 09:19.452
and there's no one here
to relieve me.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.652
That's okay. I'll just check
into a hotel, clean up...

09:21.727 --> 09:23.194
and come back
when you're finished.

09:23.262 --> 09:25.890
Sounds good,
except you won't find a motel.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.494
Filled already?

09:27.733 --> 09:32.466
No, they just won't rent to
racers. No problem. I'm not a racer.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.903
When can we meet?

09:34.974 --> 09:37.067
How about my house,
say, 9:00?

09:37.677 --> 09:40.111
Terrific. Address?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.108
Oh, yeah.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.683
You're shaking.

09:55.661 --> 09:58.186
Whatever it is,
it'll be okay.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.424
Yeah.

10:03.135 --> 10:06.400
I'd prefer it if you'd kindly
keep your hands to yourself.

10:06.472 --> 10:09.066
Open, Sesame.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.803
Who do you think you are?
Ali Baba?

10:17.049 --> 10:18.607
I ain't through
with you yet.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.883
The sign says,
"No vacancy."

10:25.057 --> 10:28.652
Well, if you're all filled up,
how come there's no cars out there?

10:29.629 --> 10:32.826
Look, if it makes any difference
to you, I am not a racer.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.889
No wild parties. No pets.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.435
Read my lips.

10:38.671 --> 10:40.764
Now leave
before I call the police.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.398
What is it about your attitude
I don't like?

10:43.476 --> 10:47.708
I've got it. I've got it. It's
your attitude. Take off, punk.

10:53.753 --> 10:57.314
Transfer my calls to the young
lady's room. Yes, Mr. Rome.

10:59.191 --> 11:02.558
I said, "Take off, punk."
I know. I heard you.

11:02.628 --> 11:03.959
Well, you're still here.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.760
I have some unfinished
business with the manager here.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.925
Any unfinished business
you got is with me.

11:09.001 --> 11:12.266
Now, one more word out of you, and
you're gonna wish you were never born.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.399
One more word out of you, and
you'll wish I never was, either.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.434
On second thought...

11:18.577 --> 11:21.205
I really don't like
this motel very much.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.253
You want more coffee?

11:34.326 --> 11:35.759
No, thanks. Go ahead.

11:36.062 --> 11:39.862
That's about it. When I found out
I'd inherited the Marberry Times...

11:39.932 --> 11:44.198
I took a week off and came out to
sell it, and instead I fell in love.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.732
With Marberry?

11:47.206 --> 11:49.674
Does that sound a little
strange? Yeah, I guess it does.

11:49.742 --> 11:51.642
No. No, it doesn't.

11:52.511 --> 11:56.072
I'll tell you what sounds strange
is what's been happening to you.

11:56.816 --> 11:59.250
Jamie, when did
the threats begin?

12:00.519 --> 12:04.512
The day after I announced I was gonna
stage the first Marberry Grand Prix.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.118
I contacted the Racing
Association of America...

12:08.194 --> 12:09.889
and they gave me
their blessing.

12:09.962 --> 12:12.123
Not only that, but they agreed
to underwrite...

12:12.198 --> 12:14.098
the cost of building
a permanent course...

12:14.166 --> 12:16.100
if this first race
was successful.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.762
Michael, this town could
use the business. Believe me.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.329
I thought the people
would be enthusiastic.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.670
At first, I just thought
it was a crank caller.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.973
Until this morning.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.274
Jamie, who owns
the Marberry Motel?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.309
I don't know.
I never thought about it. Why?

12:33.119 --> 12:35.212
I don't know. I had
something very strange happen.

12:35.287 --> 12:38.620
Do you have any idea why someone
would want to kill to stop the race?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.854
I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

12:44.630 --> 12:47.360
Wait a minute. KITT, trace
this call, will you, pal?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.627
Right away, Michael.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.032
You don't think...
I don't know. Go ahead.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.931
Hello?

12:53.572 --> 12:55.233
This is your last chance.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.608
Now cancel the race
before it's too late...

12:57.676 --> 12:59.974
or it'll be canceled
for you tomorrow.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.745
He hung up.
Did you get it?

13:01.814 --> 13:03.042
I'm tracing it now.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.148
Michael, there's a man
in a car slowing up outside...

13:09.221 --> 13:11.587
and he's paying undue
attention to Jamie's house.

13:11.657 --> 13:13.921
Okay, let's check it out.
I'll be right back.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.028
There's the car now.
I see it, buddy.

13:19.098 --> 13:20.622
I've completed
the trace, Michael.

13:20.699 --> 13:23.031
The call came from a pay phone
at the Marberry Motel.

13:23.102 --> 13:27.038
My favorite place, huh? First,
let's check this guy out.

13:38.517 --> 13:39.814
My sensors detect...

13:39.885 --> 13:41.443
an electronically activated
device.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.680
Where?

13:43.856 --> 13:45.824
The undercarriage
of Jamie's car.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.661
Jamie, get down!
What?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.900
Get down! Get down!

14:19.625 --> 14:22.116
Welcome to the Marberry Hotel.

14:22.428 --> 14:25.795
Michael, what is it about that
place that bothers you so much?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.992
For one thing,
the clientele.

14:28.067 --> 14:31.434
And for the second, the fact that that
call was made from there last night.

14:31.503 --> 14:35.098
You think that the person who wants
to stop this race is staying there?

14:35.174 --> 14:36.402
I don't know.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.306
You don't know,
or you don't wanna tell me?

14:38.377 --> 14:40.345
Jamie, the call was made
from a public phone.

14:40.412 --> 14:43.313
It could've been a guest. It could've
been a passerby. I don't know.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.816
You let me
worry about that, okay?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.983
Right now, you worry
about making...

14:49.054 --> 14:53.013
Marberry's first Grand Prix
a real big success, okay?

14:53.092 --> 14:54.081
Mmm-hmm.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.290
What are you gonna do?
First, drop you off.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.990
I'm gonna check out
the competition...

14:59.064 --> 15:01.589
to see if there's anyone in
the race who shouldn't be there.

15:11.143 --> 15:14.840
Michael, really, asking me
to qualify for a car race...

15:14.914 --> 15:18.543
is like asking Reggie Jackson if he
knows how to throw a forward pass.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.450
Remind me to have Bonnie
check out your sports chip.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.819
Besides, I don't understand why
we're entering it in the first place.

15:24.890 --> 15:28.087
Because my guess is, having
failed to discourage the sponsor...

15:28.160 --> 15:29.889
they're gonna work
on the contestants...

15:29.962 --> 15:32.556
and I wanna be close enough
to make sure nobody gets hurt.

15:32.631 --> 15:34.929
Keep your eyes open.
All right, Michael...

15:35.000 --> 15:37.434
but it would certainly help if
I knew what I was looking for.

15:37.503 --> 15:40.438
As soon as I find out,
you'll be the first to know.

15:40.506 --> 15:42.599
In the meantime, give me
hard copies on the racers...

15:42.675 --> 15:44.404
and run them through
your image databank.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.171
Whatever you say,
Michael.

15:48.714 --> 15:49.703
Hi.
Hi.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.342
If you're looking to enter the
race, you can sign up over there.

15:52.418 --> 15:55.387
Thank you very much. Next
qualifying heat's in an hour.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.888
With a little luck, we might
be up against each other.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.291
You know, I can't think of anyone in this
entire world I'd rather be up against.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.786
Thanks again, Daisy.

16:08.233 --> 16:09.757
Hey, dude.
Yo.

16:10.602 --> 16:13.503
That T-top of yours looks
a little light in the horses.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.535
That's because
he's a jumper, hot dog.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.452
I do hope this Rooster doesn't
damage my XK-100 thermal printer.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.189
Okay, dude,
time to open you up.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.442
Back to your barnyard,
Rooster. I have work to do.

17:06.759 --> 17:07.885
Michael, what's wrong?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.121
I just tried to call Jamie,
and her service said...

17:10.194 --> 17:11.787
she went
to the Marberry Motel.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.915
Nick, it's good to see you, my
good friend. And you, too, Joey.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.398
Nick, you will sit here
on Mr. C's left...

17:54.239 --> 17:57.333
and, Benji, you will sit
there on Mr. C's right.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.206
It will be good
to see him again.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.403
What do you want?

18:30.476 --> 18:32.068
I was just...
Who are you?

18:32.144 --> 18:35.238
Who are you?
I was just coming down to...

18:35.314 --> 18:38.545
Oh, honey, there you are. I have
been looking all over for you.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.847
How are you?
We just got married...

18:40.919 --> 18:42.648
and this is our honeymoon.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.053
She must have thought
that was our honeymoon suite.

18:45.290 --> 18:50.159
Maybe you don't know how that is.
Honey, please tell this man how that is.

18:51.597 --> 18:55.397
Happiest day of my life. Happiest
day of her life. You know, first...

18:55.467 --> 18:56.798
I know that voice.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.133
We would love to invite you
up for a drink...

18:59.204 --> 19:01.604
but you know how that is.
Go, will you? Go.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.104
What's happening?
What's going on?

19:07.179 --> 19:09.147
KITT, meet me outside
and hurry it up!

19:22.261 --> 19:25.128
Michael, I've heard of automatic
drive, but this is ridiculous!

19:25.197 --> 19:27.427
Would you
just get in the car?

19:27.533 --> 19:28.898
Incredible, huh?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.503
It was incredible.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.516
Michael, every time I turned around,
there was another limo pulling in.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.381
And the faces,
it was like watching...

19:47.452 --> 19:49.579
an old gangster movie
coming alive. Jamie.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.555
I wonder what was in
those attache cases.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.750
Jamie, will you listen to me?
I'm serious now.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.521
I don't want you taking
any more chances like that.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.428
Michael, come on.
I'm a trained reporter.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.197
You're also a girl
who's been run off the road...

20:02.267 --> 20:03.791
who's had her car
blown up.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.394
I mean, what is this? Last
night you were scared to death.

20:06.471 --> 20:09.338
And the reason I was scared
to death has something to do...

20:09.408 --> 20:11.467
with what's going on
in that motel. I'm sure of it.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.477
Okay, I'll find out
what's going on there...

20:13.545 --> 20:17.276
but I want you to promise me you will
not go back there again, not alone.

20:17.349 --> 20:20.318
Michael, what gave you
that idea about the honeymoon?

20:20.652 --> 20:22.813
You don't wanna hear
a word I say, do you?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.686
Well, what gave you the idea
about the honeymoon?

20:26.191 --> 20:29.422
Just the product
of a fertile imagination.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.391
It's the best kind.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.124
Have a safe race.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.268
Drivers in cars 7
and 12. Seven and 12.

20:46.345 --> 20:47.471
All right.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.673
You forgot your passive
laser restraint seatbelt.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.976
Thanks for reminding me.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.209
Do you think the heat
will be sabotaged?

20:54.286 --> 20:56.481
According to last night's
phone call, it will be.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.523
Let's be ready for anything.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.723
Take a good look, dude.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.667
The only thing you'll be seeing
from here on is my exhaust.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.798
Drivers ready? Go!

21:18.844 --> 21:21.938
Car number 12, get going!
Here we go.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.354
What did you find out
about our competition?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.189
They're not exactly
what you'd call...

21:37.262 --> 21:40.663
pillars of the community,
Michael...

21:41.800 --> 21:44.564
but except for a few
outstanding traffic citations...

21:44.636 --> 21:46.627
and one or two arrests
for disturbing the peace...

21:46.705 --> 21:49.265
none of them has ever been in
any serious trouble with the law.

21:49.341 --> 21:53.300
Well, I was hoping for something more.
I'll try to hide my disappointment.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.865
Michael, the road up ahead.
What about it?

22:26.311 --> 22:29.007
There's a high voltage wire
stretched across it.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.844
Any chance
of neutralizing it?

22:31.917 --> 22:34.078
Negative, Michael, and if
Rooster's car hits the wire...

22:34.152 --> 22:35.517
he'll be incinerated.

22:35.587 --> 22:38.852
Then we've gotta get to
it first. Let's move it.

22:58.677 --> 23:01.168
He's in our way, Michael.
We can't get around him.

23:02.647 --> 23:06.014
You're not gonna try to turbo
boost at this speed? You are.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.089
Michael,
we are going to hit it.

23:37.315 --> 23:39.112
See you around, dude!

23:45.323 --> 23:47.484
What's that strange music?

23:47.559 --> 23:49.789
It was caused
by the high voltage current...

23:49.861 --> 23:51.726
surging through
my laser modulator.

23:52.964 --> 23:54.488
Well, turn it off,
will you?

23:54.566 --> 23:57.558
All right, Michael, but I can't
guarantee it won't come back on again.

23:57.669 --> 23:59.933
I'll talk to Bonnie
about that.

24:18.356 --> 24:21.917
I have pictures, evidence.
Jamie, will you stop for a second?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.262
Jamie, you're not
listening to me.

24:24.329 --> 24:27.856
Yes, I am. The problem is that
you're not taking me seriously.

24:27.933 --> 24:31.232
Wrong. The problem is you're not
taking the situation seriously.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.204
You smell a story here, and
everything else in the world vanishes.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.570
Michael,
you don't understand.

24:37.576 --> 24:41.342
When I left Chicago to come
here, I made a tradeoff.

24:41.446 --> 24:43.812
I gave up
every journalist's dream...

24:43.882 --> 24:48.080
the chance of hitting the mother
lode, the big story. Don't you see?

24:48.153 --> 24:51.748
I gave it up, and now here
it is, knocking on my door.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.089
Just let me show you
the negatives.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.085
Oh, no.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.694
"Oh, no"? What?
What "Oh, no"?

25:00.932 --> 25:02.797
They're all underexposed.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.265
What kind of camera
did you use?

25:07.339 --> 25:10.240
The best. My grandfather
used it in the war.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.908
What war was that?

25:14.012 --> 25:16.845
I figured if it was good enough
for the Battle of the Bulge...

25:16.915 --> 25:18.906
it was good enough
for the Marberry Motel.

25:18.984 --> 25:20.417
I'll tell you what.
I'll run it...

25:20.485 --> 25:23.420
through KITT's system to see
if anything's salvageable, okay?

25:23.488 --> 25:26.787
On one condition.
I was afraid of that.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.383
You stay away
from that motel for now.

25:29.461 --> 25:32.487
I've got an appointment with Devon.
I'll be back here in two hours.

25:32.564 --> 25:35.260
Deal?
You drive a hard bargain.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.425
Deal?

25:37.736 --> 25:38.828
Deal.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.877
Need a little help
with these, partner.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.386
That's an understatement,
Michael.

26:05.463 --> 26:09.593
I don't care how sophisticated my
image-enhancement software program is...

26:09.668 --> 26:10.828
there are limits.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.394
I can't reach sufficient recognition
threshold on any of these negatives.

26:14.472 --> 26:18.499
Maybe not, but one thing's in
focus, the brown attache case.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.908
I've got an idea.

26:20.946 --> 26:25.076
Let's find the nearest leather
goods store. I was afraid of that.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.386
Looks like business
is booming.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.785
Interface with
the motel's computer.

26:37.862 --> 26:40.092
I wanna know
what room Rome's in.

26:40.165 --> 26:43.134
Yes, Michael. I just hope
this plan of yours works.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.674
Room 117.
Thank you very much.

26:53.044 --> 26:55.171
Phase One is about to begin.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.348
Will you turn
that champagne stuff off?

27:58.043 --> 28:01.479
All right, KITT, I need a diversion.
Anything particular in mind?

28:01.613 --> 28:05.777
Just use your imagination, will
you? I need to get that attache case.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.647
I'll get right on it.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.081
I think I have
just the diversion, Michael...

28:12.157 --> 28:14.057
but you'll have to
move quickly.

29:02.774 --> 29:04.298
Michael, I fail to see...

29:04.375 --> 29:06.741
what a brown attache case
has to do with anything.

29:08.813 --> 29:09.905
Look.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.044
That's a staggering amount
of money.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.680
What do you think is the connection
between the convention at the motel...

29:17.756 --> 29:19.246
and the incident
on the race course?

29:19.324 --> 29:23.021
Very good question. I don't know
what it is, but I know it's there.

29:23.094 --> 29:27.360
Since we're on the subject, I think
you might find this quite interesting.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.626
What is that?

29:29.334 --> 29:30.995
Unless I miss my guess...

29:31.069 --> 29:33.697
it's a list of all the
contributors to the family.

29:33.772 --> 29:37.640
Michael, these names.
Johnny Eyes, Julius the K...

29:38.676 --> 29:40.974
they're well-known
crime figures in Detroit.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.639
And wouldn't you say they
constitute some hard evidence?

29:43.715 --> 29:46.684
At the very least. In the hands
of the proper authorities...

29:46.751 --> 29:49.811
this information could drive a
wedge into the Detroit family.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.880
Devon, from what I've seen,
Detroit is only one of many.

29:52.957 --> 29:56.620
Hold off on that wedge until I find
out what Phase Two gives us, okay?

29:56.694 --> 29:57.854
Right.

29:58.429 --> 30:02.024
Bonnie, how's KITT coming?
I gotta check in with Jamie.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.194
He's finished. I just had to
recalibrate his suspension synchronizer.

30:05.270 --> 30:08.865
And you got rid
of all that champagne stuff?

30:08.940 --> 30:10.635
Gone forever.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.835
You are beautiful.
Now, do me one more favor.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.708
Update his databanks
on Marberry...

30:14.779 --> 30:18.442
all the prominent businesses, starting with
the motel, financial history, the works.

30:18.516 --> 30:21.280
I'll get right on it. Anything
else? I'll let you know.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.918
Michael, be careful.

31:50.775 --> 31:54.074
Where's Joey? If I know
him, he's probably asleep.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.902
I'll give him a call.

31:55.980 --> 31:58.744
Tell him to hurry.
Mr. C will be here any minute.

32:02.353 --> 32:03.980
Room 117, please.

32:09.694 --> 32:14.324
Yeah? Oh, okay. Yeah. Listen,
I'll be right there. Okay.

32:19.637 --> 32:21.366
It's not like
the good old days.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.428
Yeah.

32:22.507 --> 32:25.601
And what have we got today?
Computers and college graduates.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.935
Mr. C!

32:32.717 --> 32:36.676
Very nice. Very nice.
All of you, please sit.

32:38.856 --> 32:41.051
Now, wine for all my friends.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.884
And make yourselves at home.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.930
I'm glad all of you showed up
to pay up your respects...

32:45.997 --> 32:48.329
and I can guarantee you
it will not be forgotten...

32:48.399 --> 32:52.495
but first, I got a nice toast.
I made it up myself.

32:55.540 --> 32:58.509
But first, I believe
there's some presents.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.116
Sit, all of you.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.280
Philly.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.266
That's very nice.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.202
That's very nice.

33:27.505 --> 33:28.665
Bravo.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.876
I always liked Philly.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.479
I got a nice toast about
Philly. I made it up myself.

33:41.419 --> 33:45.321
Joey, my friend,
just in time.

33:45.390 --> 33:48.154
I wanna see
my nice present from Detroit.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.252
You're gonna be
pleased, Mr. C. I better.

34:00.238 --> 34:04.368
What is this? A joke? Joey,
tell me what's going on here.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.375
I don't know
what to say, Mr. C.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.841
I don't like no jokes
from Detroit.

34:18.523 --> 34:20.650
Better think of something,
Joey.

34:21.025 --> 34:23.585
Whatever it is, it better
lead to the money, Joey.

34:23.694 --> 34:25.719
Hey, what was that?

34:26.197 --> 34:28.097
Over there. That table.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.774
Michael,
I hope you're wrong...

34:45.850 --> 34:47.818
about Jamie going back
to that motel.

34:47.885 --> 34:49.750
That makes two of us, pal...

34:50.054 --> 34:52.454
but that receipt I found
for a new mini-camera...

34:52.523 --> 34:54.081
in her office tells me
I'm not.

34:54.158 --> 34:57.423
But why wouldn't she leave word with
her service as she did the last time?

34:57.495 --> 35:00.396
Because the last time
I found her, remember?

35:00.465 --> 35:02.660
Sometimes, I think this girl
goes out of her way...

35:02.733 --> 35:05.861
to make things difficult
for me. And possibly herself.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.632
I only hope
we're not too late.

35:07.705 --> 35:10.037
I do, too, partner.
I do, too.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.903
At least, this time, we've got
an electronic ace up our sleeve.

35:13.978 --> 35:17.505
Let's just hope it's enough,
buddy. It's Jamie I'm worried about.

35:53.851 --> 35:55.614
Front desk, manager.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.547
Hello?

35:58.823 --> 36:01.053
Hello? This is
the front desk, manager.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.179
Joey, Nick, get rid of her.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.474
The nineteenth hole?

36:23.548 --> 36:25.448
Yeah,
the nineteenth hole.

36:33.591 --> 36:36.185
That's where we put
snoopy reporters.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.586
Your plan was working,
Michael.

36:38.663 --> 36:41.598
Who knows what else we might've
learned if Jamie hadn't shown up?

36:41.666 --> 36:43.827
But she did, pal. She did.

36:45.102 --> 36:48.435
"The nineteenth hole," that's
usually a phrase for the bar.

36:48.506 --> 36:51.498
KITT, punch up your schematic
on the Marberry Golf Course.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.043
Right away, Michael.

36:56.747 --> 36:59.443
Does it have a bar?
Negative, Michael.

36:59.517 --> 37:01.007
What's directly
behind the course?

37:01.085 --> 37:04.816
A small housing tract,
recreation area, shopping center.

37:05.122 --> 37:07.556
What about this area right
here? It looks undeveloped.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.115
It is, Michael.

37:09.193 --> 37:11.923
Who owns it? The city, but
here's something interesting.

37:11.996 --> 37:13.691
If the Racing Association
of America...

37:13.764 --> 37:15.664
does build a permanent course
in Marberry...

37:15.733 --> 37:18.600
the city has offered that
piece of land for its clubhouse.

37:18.669 --> 37:21.570
KITT, I think we found
the nineteenth hole.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.865
All right, let's see
what else we can find.

37:23.941 --> 37:25.966
Michael, you know
the race is starting now.

37:26.043 --> 37:28.204
If they're really intent
on stopping it...

37:28.279 --> 37:31.305
I hear you, pal. I hear you.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.714
Starting time in five minutes.

37:37.788 --> 37:41.019
Official starting time
in five minutes.

37:47.531 --> 37:49.294
My car's gone!

37:49.367 --> 37:52.598
Somebody stole my car! Now, hold
everything here. Wait a minute!

37:52.670 --> 37:54.968
Wait a minute! Stop!
You ain't going anywhere!

37:55.039 --> 37:57.007
You see who took my car?

38:11.022 --> 38:12.785
This is it, Michael.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.252
Anything unusual?

38:19.330 --> 38:21.730
There's a shack hidden
within those trees.

38:21.799 --> 38:25.826
All right, check out the
terrain, top and bottom.

38:37.081 --> 38:41.450
Michael, a short distance up ahead,
there's something buried beneath the ground.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.547
What are those?

38:46.624 --> 38:50.060
They're wooden boxes,
measuring seven by four by two.

38:50.227 --> 38:52.195
All right,
scan what's inside of them.

38:55.099 --> 38:59.502
Oh, no. Human remains. Some of the
bodies have been here for many years.

39:00.538 --> 39:01.732
Jamie?

39:01.806 --> 39:04.798
No, Michael. According to
my geological analyzer...

39:04.875 --> 39:08.572
the earth around here hasn't been
disturbed for at least six months.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.143
The nineteenth hole.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.080
KITT, this is the place they bury
people when they get in their way.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.718
No wonder they're so determined
to keep this land undeveloped.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.781
All right, put yourself
on silent mode.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.053
Let's check out that shack.

39:56.293 --> 39:57.920
All right,
scan the inside.

40:02.333 --> 40:06.167
Michael, there's only one
person. A man. Could be Joey.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.333
And according
to his vital signs...

40:10.408 --> 40:12.376
he's very nervous
about something.

40:12.476 --> 40:16.412
After losing Mr. C's money, I'd
say that something is his life.

40:17.281 --> 40:19.272
Can you imitate
Mr. C's voice?

40:19.350 --> 40:22.615
Once it's on my anharmonic
synthesizer, no problem.

40:23.320 --> 40:26.414
All right, let's get him
out here, the easy way.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.154
Meet me
in front of the shack.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.311
Hey, Joey, it's Mr. C.

40:55.786 --> 40:59.244
Come out, Joey.
I wanna talk to you.

41:01.058 --> 41:05.427
Joey, don't make me send the boys
to get you. Don't make me mad.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.559
Hey, Joey. Come out, Joey.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.578
What do you want?
Where's Jamie?

41:26.650 --> 41:28.709
Get off my back.
And I want my money.

41:28.786 --> 41:30.947
The only thing you're
gonna get is about 15 years.

41:31.021 --> 41:33.455
For what? Giving an old
friend a little present?

41:33.524 --> 41:35.151
Joey, Joey, Joey.

41:35.826 --> 41:38.693
I found the list of names
in your attache case...

41:38.762 --> 41:42.391
and what about the bodies buried
over there in the nineteenth hole?

41:42.666 --> 41:46.261
But, you see, I'm a real nice guy,
so you know what I'm gonna do for you?

41:46.337 --> 41:47.326
What?

41:47.404 --> 41:49.599
I'm gonna deliver you
to your real good friend...

41:49.673 --> 41:51.265
Mr. C, and let him deal
with you.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.367
No, wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold. Wait.

41:53.444 --> 41:56.641
All right, Nick and I
left the hotel with Jamie...

41:56.747 --> 41:58.772
and when we got here,
Mr. C called...

41:58.849 --> 42:02.012
and he told Nick that he figured a
way to kill two birds with one stone.

42:02.086 --> 42:05.419
Now, Nick took her somewhere, and
I was told to stay here and wait.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.615
Where did they take her?

42:06.690 --> 42:09.659
Someplace called Roads End.
It's part of the race course.

42:09.727 --> 42:12.252
Look, you gotta get me
some protection.

42:12.329 --> 42:14.889
Maybe I could be one of
those government witnesses.

42:14.965 --> 42:16.990
You wanna be
a government witness?

42:17.067 --> 42:19.433
Yeah. KITT, he wants to
be a government witness.

42:19.503 --> 42:23.098
Let's put him some place
real safe. Pop the trunk.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.798
Coming right up.

42:29.947 --> 42:32.074
In the trunk?
In the trunk.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.545
Michael, the racers
should be coming up...

42:37.621 --> 42:38.952
to Roads End any minute now.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.354
All right.

43:21.832 --> 43:23.823
How far to Roads End?

43:25.636 --> 43:27.228
1.3 miles.

43:27.304 --> 43:31.138
All right, now give me a graphic of the
race course, and pinpoint the lead cars.

43:33.143 --> 43:34.610
Thank you very much.

43:34.678 --> 43:37.704
Let's just make sure we reach
Roads End before the lead cars do.

43:47.524 --> 43:49.583
Michael, we're approaching
Roads End.

43:50.995 --> 43:53.361
KITT, what's that dead ahead?
Give me a visual.

43:53.597 --> 43:54.894
That's Rooster's car!

43:54.965 --> 43:58.298
Michael, the area directly in front
of the car is wired to explode.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.202
The first car passing will
trigger the detonating device...

44:01.271 --> 44:04.138
and disintegrate any vehicle
within a 50-yard radius.

44:04.208 --> 44:06.608
KITT, is someone
inside that car?

44:06.944 --> 44:09.606
Jamie. I'm activating
your microwave jammer.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.748
See if you can start
the Red Rooster.

44:29.800 --> 44:33.429
Michael, in exactly 10.3 seconds,
the lead cars will be incinerated.

44:33.504 --> 44:36.996
Not if we can help it. KITT,
we gotta smother that bomb.

44:37.074 --> 44:39.975
I don't know if I can withstand
a bomb of that magnitude.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.671
We got no choice.

44:42.312 --> 44:44.610
We've got 10 seconds
and counting.

44:44.982 --> 44:48.577
Nine, eight, seven...

44:50.587 --> 44:54.353
Five, four, three...

44:55.159 --> 44:57.423
two, one.

45:19.850 --> 45:23.217
Well, you wanted
the mother lode. You got it.

45:23.287 --> 45:24.845
That was some explosion.

45:25.489 --> 45:29.448
Not the explosion, your dream,
remember? Your big story?

45:29.893 --> 45:31.656
Oh, right.

45:33.630 --> 45:34.892
It'll do.

45:35.432 --> 45:36.490
"It'll do"...

45:56.153 --> 45:59.884
Hamburgers, French fries, and
malts, just like the good old days.

45:59.990 --> 46:01.958
Talking of the
good old days, Michael...

46:02.025 --> 46:04.118
did you know that I did
some driving myself?

46:04.194 --> 46:07.857
Really? Yes, really.
Formula cars, mostly.

46:08.365 --> 46:11.334
The Strasbourg Grand Prix,
Monte Carlo...

46:11.502 --> 46:13.663
the Tour de Versailles
to name but a few.

46:13.737 --> 46:17.366
Very impressive. Devon, someday,
you have to show us your trophies.

46:19.243 --> 46:20.505
Trophies?

46:20.744 --> 46:24.441
Well, Bonnie, I never actually
took home any trophies.

46:24.581 --> 46:27.982
No trophies, but I always
finished. Always finished...

46:28.051 --> 46:29.712
and I have
wonderful memories.

46:29.787 --> 46:33.746
Well, maybe next year you can enter
the second annual Marberry Grand Prix.

46:35.159 --> 46:36.820
Yes.
Yes.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.049
Yeah.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.765
Yes, well, maybe.

46:45.302 --> 46:46.997
Oh, no, not again.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.335
They stole the Red Rooster.

46:55.412 --> 47:00.042
No trophy, no money, and,
worst of all, no satisfaction.

47:00.117 --> 47:03.109
What kind of satisfaction
are you looking for?

47:03.520 --> 47:06.785
You! You and that black bucket
that you call a car!

47:06.857 --> 47:10.384
Well, since you put it that way,
it seems it's the least I can do.

47:10.460 --> 47:13.918
Will you all excuse from the
table, please? You're excused.

47:15.833 --> 47:18.461
You're on, hot dog.
All right, dude.

47:18.535 --> 47:19.729
I'll be right back.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.733
This I can't wait to see.

47:38.355 --> 47:41.256
Really, Michael,
this is highly unorthodox.

47:41.658 --> 47:43.819
Just protecting
your honor, buddy.

47:45.295 --> 47:47.923
Well, he is a rude,
crude dude.

47:49.666 --> 47:51.065
You call it.

47:52.202 --> 47:53.294
Now!
