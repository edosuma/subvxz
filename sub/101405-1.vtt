WEBVTT

01:51.195 --> 01:52.029
I'm sorry,
are you available?

01:52.112 --> 01:52.946
Yeah, get in!

01:53.030 --> 01:54.907
Yeah.
Get in, guys.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.202
Hi Hi.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.370
So we're going to 76th
and Queens Boulevard.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.039
- Okay.
- Is that okay?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.707
- Yeah. Great.
- Is that grandma's house?

02:03.790 --> 02:04.625
Yes.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.400
- You're good to go?
- Yeah, I'm good.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.318
Okay.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.277
Head first. Okay.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.363
Watch your head.

02:42.538 --> 02:43.956
Sir, where are you going?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.196
I'm coming!

03:28.709 --> 03:30.210
Antonio!

03:33.964 --> 03:37.217
Antonio, wake up!

04:43.700 --> 04:44.535
What's up?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.703
You have an
appointment tomorrow.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.206
Oh, don't remind me.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.750
Do you wanna do
this or not?

04:51.834 --> 04:53.877
Of course
I want to do this.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.005
It's just so much - I have
to go to the doctor,

04:57.089 --> 04:59.550
to see the psychologist,
to get the letter,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.385
to get the approval...

05:01.468 --> 05:02.386
Listen,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.721
I've seen girls do this
black market style

05:04.805 --> 05:07.474
and you don't want any
part of that, trust.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.144
I know, you're right.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.938
They just wanna get
to know you, Tina.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.482
Now, listen,
you got to be honest,

05:15.566 --> 05:16.400
all right?
Yes, yes.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.235
I'm going to tell
them everything,

05:18.318 --> 05:21.071
like who I am,
where I came from,

05:21.154 --> 05:23.198
what I had for breakfast.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.326
Girl, just let them know it.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.161
If he doesn't
approve you, Tina,

05:28.245 --> 05:29.079
you can't transition.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.290
I know. I know.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.583
Right.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.334
And I believe in you.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.586
I'll talk to you later.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.630
Love you.
Love you.

05:38.714 --> 05:39.548
Bye.

05:48.140 --> 05:49.391
Good morning, Grandma.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.018
What's this?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.313
It came! Hold on...

05:54.396 --> 05:55.522
What is it?

05:56.648 --> 05:58.192
You're gonna love it.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.404
Close your eyes!

06:04.740 --> 06:05.574
- No peeking.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.827
No, no, no, no, no. Okay, Fine.

06:10.454 --> 06:12.539
Okay, open.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.333
Look!

06:14.416 --> 06:16.376
Antonio.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.005
Oh my God, you bought it!

06:20.464 --> 06:22.341
The one we saw on TV.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.718
Now, you don't have to bend
down.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.683
It's the future.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.893
Oh, Grandma.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.228
I'm going to the market.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.771
- Ah!
- Do you need anything?

06:35.896 --> 06:36.730
No, no, no.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.899
- I'm good.
- Should I leave it with you?

06:38.982 --> 06:41.443
Yeah, I'm going to try it out.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.361
Oh, Grandma.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.988
All right, go on. God bless you.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.616
Hi.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.595
Thanks.
Have a good one.

08:14.536 --> 08:17.080
Grandma, I'm back.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.335
What's wrong?

08:21.793 --> 08:25.464
I broke it. I'm an idiot.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.300
I broke it already!

08:28.383 --> 08:30.636
Let me see, let me see.
Calm down.

08:30.719 --> 08:33.429
These instructions are all in
English!

08:34.056 --> 08:35.140
Oh, Grandma.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.725
What?

08:36.808 --> 08:38.519
You didn't break it.

08:38.602 --> 08:41.104
- I didn't?
- This is so funny, look.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.607
Really?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.235
Oh, Antonio. You're such a
handyman.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.862
You can do more than you think.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.449
All right, all right, all
right...

08:53.367 --> 08:55.410
But, how about this vacuum, huh?

08:55.494 --> 08:58.622
It's wonderful. And, it works!

08:58.705 --> 08:59.915
Look how it dances.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.293
You got all your moves
from your grandmother.

09:41.832 --> 09:44.084
Where are you from?

09:44.626 --> 09:48.797
I'm from Mexico, but I have been
here since I was five years old.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.966
How long have you been driving?

09:51.049 --> 09:52.676
Almost eight years.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.136
Quite a lot...

09:54.219 --> 09:55.304
Yeah.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.471
And you? Where are you from?

09:56.555 --> 09:57.973
I'm from El Salvador.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.016
Which part?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
From San Salvador.

10:43.435 --> 10:46.730
Do you have any concerns
relating to your family?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.441
No, not really.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.359
No?

10:51.527 --> 10:53.195
The boys at school
made fun of me

10:53.278 --> 10:54.821
when I didn't want
to play football.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.075
When I'd get home
I would run to my room

10:58.158 --> 10:59.409
and hide under the covers.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.079
Grandma would come in,
sit next to me on the bed

11:02.162 --> 11:04.581
and she'd say that
I made her very proud.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.959
She's the only
family I have.

11:07.042 --> 11:08.293
We're very close.

11:09.461 --> 11:11.588
Let's just say she
always has my back.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.341
Wow.

11:15.300 --> 11:20.222
Now, do you remember
anything about Mexico?

11:21.223 --> 11:23.517
Ah, not...

11:23.600 --> 11:25.227
I mean,
maybe a little.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.522
Maybe I just remember
what grandma tells me.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.065
She talks about
it all the time.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.567
The food.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.528
Her home.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.364
The garden.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.704
Why are you here?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.253
All right,
there's certainly

11:51.336 --> 11:54.006
no need that you have to
tell me now but eventually

11:54.089 --> 11:56.884
I'd like to hear
the answer to that.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.070
Hey, are you gonna help me?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.073
Hello?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.244
Are you napping on me?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.331
I can't do it.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.000
And I can't do this
all by myself.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.295
Every week it's
the same shit.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.548
Why are you here, Tina?

12:36.632 --> 12:38.175
Are you happy?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.135
Do you accept the
full consequences

12:40.219 --> 12:41.428
of the side effects?

12:41.803 --> 12:43.222
I'm on your team.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.099
Everyone's life is complicated.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.062
I know, girl.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.314
No shit my life's complicated.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.482
Whose isn't?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.901
I just don't know why
I have to convince some

12:55.984 --> 12:57.778
old ass man of who I am.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.864
Do you want this
done the right way?

13:00.948 --> 13:01.782
Yeah.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.825
Then listen to your
fucking doctor.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.955
I listen to old people
all day, every day.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.792
Do you know how many girls
I know that went to him?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.254
He's like the first doctor
that started working

13:15.337 --> 13:16.630
with us in New York City.

13:17.881 --> 13:18.966
Trust me.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.803
You're in good hands.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.556
How many more questions am
I gonna have to answer?

13:25.639 --> 13:27.224
Probably forty billion.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.017
Ugh, stop.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.814
Probably never met
anyone quite like you.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.277
You're doing it wrong.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.655
It just rained like
four hours ago.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.906
Why are you watering it?

13:42.990 --> 13:45.742
And what do you know
about gardening?

13:45.826 --> 13:46.827
I know two things

13:46.910 --> 13:49.079
that my grandma taught
me back in Mexico.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.540
How to garden
and how to cook.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.457
Hmm.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.002
And I still don't know
how to cook.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.009
We're not gonna
fucking get anything.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.219
Yo Chrisy!

14:04.303 --> 14:05.470
Are you constipated?

14:05.554 --> 14:06.930
Let it out, bro.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.226
What'd we got here?

14:11.310 --> 14:12.936
Oh, cream pies!

14:13.020 --> 14:14.605
Hey, c'mon guys, you
have to pay for those.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.565
Yo, we'll catch you later, bro.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.025
Relax, okay?
Geez.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.485
Ahh, yo, let me get a pack
of Cowboy Killers.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.030
It's 12 bucks.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.781
Come on, just to
hump a little faggot, man.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.699
Just give it to me.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.284
I'll pay you back later, man.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.285
Come on.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.995
Come on, due today,
we gotta go.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.248
Thank you.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.042
Yo, Saturday, 6'oclock,
all right?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.418
No excuses, all right?

14:36.502 --> 14:37.336
You gonna fucking be there?

14:37.419 --> 14:38.712
- Yeah.
- You're gonna fucking be there?

14:38.795 --> 14:39.630
All right. Yeah.

14:40.631 --> 14:41.590
Come on, no fucking excuses,
all right?

14:41.673 --> 14:43.425
And don't be fucking late,
all right?

14:43.509 --> 14:44.468
Thanks for the chocolate, boss.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.636
Peace out, Chrisy.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.513
See you later, pussy.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.112
This place is amazing.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.114
Right? Told you.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.868
It's about time
you took me out.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.035
What do you mean?

15:54.788 --> 15:57.124
I mean this is
a big step for you.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.295
I still don't know
what you mean.

16:07.050 --> 16:07.885
What?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.511
We're both busy people.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.013
We're out now,
aren't we?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.683
We are, and it's wonderful.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.062
Our delivery guy is gonna
think we died or something.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.027
Hey, you look stunning.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.321
Yeah?

16:29.323 --> 16:30.490
You're not too bad yourself.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.205
Yeah? Beautiful night.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.166
That food was so good.

16:40.542 --> 16:41.376
You like that?

16:41.460 --> 16:42.836
It's one for the books, man.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.922
Yeah, that's bucket
list shit, bro.

16:47.341 --> 16:49.092
Did you see that
fucking tranny, bro?

16:49.468 --> 16:50.928
No, fucking way.

16:51.512 --> 16:53.055
Curb that bitch, man!

19:18.534 --> 19:20.661
It'll get better. Shh.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.041
Look at me.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.212
You're beautiful.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.900
Shit.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.155
Those titties
are hot as hell.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.573
Holy shit...

20:44.411 --> 20:46.330
Oh my God,
he's like pounding her,

20:46.413 --> 20:49.333
holy shit.
Watch the cum shot...

20:49.416 --> 20:50.792
1 -2...

20:50.876 --> 20:54.838
oohh That's
a lot of jizz, bro.

20:54.922 --> 20:58.175
Like superhero status...
Guy's fucking loaded, man.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.969
Yo, get your hand
off your dick.

21:01.053 --> 21:02.346
C'mon, you guys act
like you don't do it too.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.639
Yeah, at home.

21:03.722 --> 21:04.640
Not in front of
my friends,

21:04.723 --> 21:06.058
ya fucking faggot...

21:07.434 --> 21:08.644
Little freak.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.806
Where were you last night?

21:47.349 --> 21:48.642
Looking for a job?

21:50.435 --> 21:51.270
Yes.

21:53.981 --> 21:55.023
You're lying.

21:56.984 --> 21:58.819
He could have slept on the sofa.

21:59.278 --> 22:01.613
He didn't need
to sleep on the sofa.

22:01.697 --> 22:04.324
You're not a good friend,
Antonio.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.244
I think he had a good time.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.872
All right, fine. I won't get
in your business.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.709
Good idea.

22:14.459 --> 22:16.420
Don't speak to me like that.

22:16.712 --> 22:23.802
Listen. I take care of the money
and you take care of the house.

22:26.722 --> 22:30.642
Maybe your friend could help
you get a job.

22:31.185 --> 22:32.477
He can't.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.980
Why not?
That's what friends are for.

22:42.196 --> 22:43.238
Penn Station, please.

22:44.198 --> 22:46.450
Yeah, hoping to
catch the train.

22:50.204 --> 22:51.872
Shouldn't be too bad.

23:36.333 --> 23:42.172
Do you feel that
there is a fit between

23:42.256 --> 23:45.008
how you feel
about your gender

23:45.092 --> 23:46.927
and how others perceive you?

24:01.358 --> 24:04.361
Are there issues in your
life that might complicate

24:04.444 --> 24:06.780
the transition process?

24:09.157 --> 24:10.117
No.

24:11.118 --> 24:16.164
How do you feel about
the permanent effect

24:16.248 --> 24:18.250
of these hormones?

24:18.333 --> 24:19.918
I don't know...

24:20.002 --> 24:23.255
Carol keeps asking me to get
a matching tattoo with her,

24:23.338 --> 24:25.299
but I "chicken out every time.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.720
I’m afraid I’ll get bored
of it or something."

24:29.803 --> 24:30.721
And?

24:30.804 --> 24:33.765
And this is nothing
like a tattoo.

24:33.849 --> 24:34.975
It's much more serious.

24:35.058 --> 24:35.893
Yeah.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.728
It's not a choice.

24:37.811 --> 24:40.772
I'm trying to get
you to understand

24:40.856 --> 24:42.733
what you're getting into.

24:42.816 --> 24:43.650
Ugh.

24:46.862 --> 24:52.075
Now, we're working
together you and I.

24:52.159 --> 24:54.369
We're on the same team.

24:55.495 --> 24:59.499
But I need to know more
so that I can evaluate you.

25:05.339 --> 25:06.465
Hmm.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.258
That's exactly what I needed.

25:08.342 --> 25:09.593
Thank you, Demos.

25:10.010 --> 25:10.969
Thank you, Demos.

25:11.053 --> 25:12.179
Enjoy, ladies.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.861
What is wrong?

25:34.451 --> 25:35.994
I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

25:37.204 --> 25:39.414
Hey, don't give up.

25:40.749 --> 25:41.583
What's your name?

25:43.377 --> 25:45.087
Don't ignore me.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.589
What is your name?

25:50.884 --> 25:51.718
Tina.

25:51.802 --> 25:53.387
Damn right you are.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.640
Demos, who is this?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.976
Tina Damn right that is.

25:59.059 --> 25:59.977
Demos, Tina.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.395
Tina, Demos.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.399
You guys don't get it.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.067
How do I not get it?

26:07.901 --> 26:10.779
Well, about time you
decided to show up.

26:12.322 --> 26:13.156
Where's Demos?

26:13.240 --> 26:14.658
Somebody order me a drink.

26:14.741 --> 26:15.951
Are you okay?

26:16.034 --> 26:17.661
Just came from the hospital.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.329
What is wrong?

26:19.413 --> 26:21.123
I'm fine.
It's not me.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.668
Do you remember Rosie
from my Poetry Club?

26:24.751 --> 26:26.170
Yeah.

26:26.253 --> 26:30.215
Well, she was beat by
two cops last night.

26:30.299 --> 26:31.133
Oh.

26:31.216 --> 26:33.177
Oh, my God.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.970
These fucking cops!

26:35.053 --> 26:35.888
These are the people

26:35.971 --> 26:37.723
who are supposed to
be protecting us,

26:37.806 --> 26:39.892
not attacking us.

26:39.975 --> 26:42.227
But why?
Because she's like us,

26:42.311 --> 26:43.228
that's why...

26:47.274 --> 26:48.775
We have to mobilize.

26:51.695 --> 26:52.529
All of us.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.323
Band together and fight this.

26:55.616 --> 26:58.535
Well, I'm not sure
I'll be of any help...

26:58.619 --> 26:59.870
I'm not really a motivator.

26:59.953 --> 27:01.121
Oh, girl, you're killing me.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.123
Read this.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.126
This is who was
silenced last night...

27:09.838 --> 27:11.173
Are you with us?

27:19.306 --> 27:21.892
I'd like to thank my
wonderfully supportive boss,

27:21.975 --> 27:23.810
Mr. Ning,
for allowing us to use

27:23.894 --> 27:25.562
his business for
our headquarters.

27:25.646 --> 27:26.563
Thank you, Mr. Ning!

27:29.316 --> 27:31.610
It is with great pleasure
that I introduce,

27:31.693 --> 27:33.070
esteemed advocate,

27:33.153 --> 27:36.573
hailing from the great
city of San Francisco,

27:36.657 --> 27:39.576
my girl,
Lilly Villahermosa!

27:46.458 --> 27:48.418
Thank you all so much.

27:48.502 --> 27:50.128
Why are we all here tonight?

27:50.212 --> 27:52.089
For Rosie! Rosie!

27:52.172 --> 27:54.216
We're angry!
Yes.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.467
We're angry,

27:55.551 --> 27:56.927
but we're not defeated.

27:57.010 --> 27:57.928
No.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.514
We want justice.

28:00.597 --> 28:05.936
We want justice for Rosie
and the thousands of others

28:06.019 --> 28:08.146
whose names history
has forgotten.

28:08.230 --> 28:11.775
We accepted being outcasts

28:11.859 --> 28:15.487
but we forgot
something so vital.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.114
That we have a voice.

28:17.197 --> 28:19.408
We don't need anyone
to speak for us.

28:19.491 --> 28:22.244
We can speak for
ourselves and we will.

28:24.955 --> 28:30.836
Our sister Rosie was
dragged to the ground

28:30.919 --> 28:33.797
by someone who was
supposed to protect us.

28:33.881 --> 28:34.798
We ask why.

28:36.717 --> 28:38.552
But we know why.

28:38.635 --> 28:41.430
From the moment Rosie
spoke her truth,

28:41.513 --> 28:42.806
she had a target on her back.

28:42.890 --> 28:43.724
That's right.

28:43.807 --> 28:44.975
Yes, it is.

28:45.058 --> 28:47.394
The same one that I wear.

28:48.645 --> 28:50.564
The one that we all share.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.734
And I don't know
about any of you

28:53.817 --> 28:57.654
but I am sick and tired
of living like this.

28:58.739 --> 29:02.701
We have the
right to exist!

29:02.784 --> 29:04.745
We might be the children
of a lesser God,

29:04.828 --> 29:06.496
but it is a God nonetheless.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.583
That's right.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.543
We have to stand up and
fight for ourselves!

29:11.627 --> 29:13.504
We'll make them pay!

29:13.587 --> 29:15.756
No, we show
respect.

29:15.839 --> 29:17.466
We show respect when
we're given respect.

29:17.549 --> 29:19.885
We're gonna make everyone
hate us even more?

29:19.968 --> 29:21.220
Then they win.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.429
Enough!

29:24.848 --> 29:28.435
We all have our
differences in this room.

29:30.646 --> 29:34.858
But it is time to retake our
seats at the table of society.

29:34.942 --> 29:37.778
It is time that
we take to the streets

29:37.861 --> 29:39.696
and demand our rights!

29:39.780 --> 29:42.199
And let history record
with a certainty

29:42.282 --> 29:45.536
that some of us may
fall that on this night,

29:45.619 --> 29:49.498
this gypsy band of wonderful,
vibrant,

29:49.581 --> 29:51.041
and creative
people decided to

29:51.124 --> 29:52.501
say in one voice...

29:52.584 --> 29:53.418
"No more!"

29:53.669 --> 29:55.045
No more!

29:55.128 --> 29:58.549
Tonight, we unite,
from this day forward,

29:58.632 --> 29:59.716
we are one.

29:59.800 --> 30:04.638
Because I am Rosie,
you are Rosie,

30:04.721 --> 30:06.640
we are all Rosie.

30:07.015 --> 30:07.975
Rosie!

30:08.058 --> 30:09.101
Rosie!

30:09.184 --> 30:14.273
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!
Rosie! Rosie! Rosie!

32:13.725 --> 32:14.726
Oh, my Gosh.

32:14.810 --> 32:16.353
I saw the picture,
they were great.

32:16.436 --> 32:17.521
I look awful.

32:17.604 --> 32:19.189
No. Come on,
you look gorgeous.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.107
What?

32:22.025 --> 32:23.694
I don't know.
I've never...

32:23.777 --> 32:26.029
I never thought I'd be
involved in activism

32:26.113 --> 32:26.989
or something, but...

32:28.115 --> 32:30.742
it just feels right,
you know?

32:30.826 --> 32:33.245
Well, I'm proud of you.

32:33.328 --> 32:34.997
You should be
proud of yourself.

32:35.080 --> 32:35.914
Yeah.

32:36.540 --> 32:37.374
Cheers.

32:37.457 --> 32:38.625
To the happy couple.

32:43.964 --> 32:45.382
So get this, Kevy.

32:45.465 --> 32:46.550
We're walking in
the park one day,

32:46.633 --> 32:47.801
over by Bethesda...

32:47.885 --> 32:49.344
Again with this story.
Why do you...

32:49.428 --> 32:51.096
Let me finish.
Let me finish...

32:51.180 --> 32:52.097
And all of a sudden,

32:52.181 --> 32:55.350
his Uncle Frank comes
jogging right past us.

32:55.434 --> 32:57.811
We keep walking but
he comes right back

32:57.895 --> 32:58.979
around to meet us.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.314
But funny enough,

33:00.397 --> 33:02.399
Jason didn't even
bother introducing us.

33:02.482 --> 33:03.317
We...

33:05.152 --> 33:06.570
What can I say, Jay?

33:06.653 --> 33:07.738
We spoke for two seconds.

33:07.821 --> 33:09.072
He was jogging.

33:09.156 --> 33:11.533
Yeah, and what's your
excuse for your parents?

33:11.617 --> 33:12.618
Are they jogging too?

33:16.163 --> 33:17.664
Can we just enjoy the night?

33:18.624 --> 33:20.167
You're missing the point here.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.255
Are you happy?

33:25.339 --> 33:27.007
What?

33:27.090 --> 33:28.842
Are you happy
being with me?

33:31.428 --> 33:32.262
Yes.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.431
Now stop questioning
me all the time.

33:34.515 --> 33:36.099
What's wrong with
the two of you?

33:36.183 --> 33:39.269
Kevin, do I look happy to you?

33:39.353 --> 33:42.147
Well, you usually are
when you're sitting next

33:42.231 --> 33:43.273
to a beautiful woman.

33:44.566 --> 33:45.943
See, what did I tell you?

33:46.026 --> 33:47.361
You're both full of shit.

33:48.862 --> 33:49.905
It's last round, okay?

33:49.988 --> 33:50.822
Last call.

33:50.906 --> 33:52.783
What the hell?
It's not even midnight.

33:52.866 --> 33:55.661
No, it isn't, buddy,
but Stephanie quit on me.

33:55.744 --> 33:56.662
So, what am I gonna do?

33:56.745 --> 33:58.455
- Do you need someone?
- Yeah.

33:58.539 --> 33:59.456
I'm looking for a job.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.541
You bartending?

34:00.624 --> 34:02.125
Shut up.
I can do it.

34:02.209 --> 34:03.043
You know how to
make a Manhattan?

34:03.126 --> 34:04.795
Pssh.
That's easy.

34:04.878 --> 34:05.838
Come on in,
let me see.

34:05.921 --> 34:06.880
Okay.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.467
That was a good move.

34:10.551 --> 34:11.969
I'm happy to show you.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.387
Here's the big test.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.559
Oh. Now this.

34:23.563 --> 34:24.398
Boom.

34:24.898 --> 34:25.774
Try that.

34:33.991 --> 34:34.824
That's pretty good.

34:34.908 --> 34:36.493
Yeah?
Yeah, you're hired.

34:36.577 --> 34:37.661
Ha! Honestly.

34:37.744 --> 34:38.579
No, it is.
It's good.

34:38.661 --> 34:39.496
Seriously?

34:39.580 --> 34:40.998
You're gonna trust
her after one drink?

34:41.081 --> 34:41.915
Yeah.
That's...

34:41.998 --> 34:44.042
You're hired.
I'll give you the job.

34:44.126 --> 34:45.418
Ha.
Come here.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.754
I know more
than one drink, babe.

34:53.552 --> 34:55.679
Thatta boy!
C'mon, you got it.

34:55.762 --> 34:56.597
Come on.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.807
Come on, man.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.392
Let's do it.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.394
Right out of the
fucking park, baby.

35:02.477 --> 35:04.855
Yeah!

35:04.938 --> 35:08.984
Let's do it.

35:12.446 --> 35:14.031
Control, Chris,
all right? Control.

35:14.114 --> 35:15.073
Don't you hit none
of that dumb shit,

35:15.157 --> 35:15.991
all right, baby?

35:16.074 --> 35:16.909
Wait, Chris, Chris.

35:16.992 --> 35:18.243
Come here, come here.

35:18.327 --> 35:19.661
This bitch likes to
pitch high, all right.

35:19.745 --> 35:21.330
- So don't be fooled, all right?
- Yeah.

35:21.413 --> 35:23.373
C'mon, Chris,

35:23.457 --> 35:25.125
bring me home!

35:25.209 --> 35:26.877
Hit that shit to
right field, baby.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.253
That kid sucks dick.

35:28.337 --> 35:29.213
You got this, Chris.

35:29.296 --> 35:30.130
I believe in you.
Let's do it, Chris.

35:30.214 --> 35:31.882
I believe in you.
Come on.

35:31.965 --> 35:36.178
Come on.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.306
Keep your eye on
the fucking ball.

35:39.389 --> 35:43.143
What the fuck you
waiting for?

35:43.227 --> 35:44.728
Hey, move in.
We got a rookie.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.522
Shake it off.

35:52.945 --> 35:53.904
Come on!

35:53.987 --> 35:55.239
What the fuck was that!?

35:55.322 --> 35:57.032
This motherfucking pussy is
gonna make us lose the game.

35:57.115 --> 35:57.950
Okay.

35:58.033 --> 35:58.909
So, why you fucking...
Why you fucking...

35:58.992 --> 36:00.410
Dude, just let play.
I told you.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.328
Let him play the
fucking game, shut up.

36:01.411 --> 36:02.246
Hey, man,
c'mon let's go.

36:02.329 --> 36:03.288
We gotta finish this game.

36:03.372 --> 36:04.873
I gotta get home and
fuck your mother tonight.

36:04.957 --> 36:12.631
Bitch.

36:12.714 --> 36:14.591
Hey, go fuck off, bitch.

36:14.675 --> 36:15.676
Come on, Chris.

36:44.746 --> 36:46.456
Wait up a sec.

36:46.540 --> 36:47.749
Hey, Chris.

36:49.877 --> 36:50.961
Good job tonight, man.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.254
Thanks, man.

36:52.337 --> 36:53.172
Wow.

36:53.255 --> 36:54.381
Look at that shiner, dude.

36:54.464 --> 36:55.299
Ooh. I know.

36:55.382 --> 36:56.967
- It's good. It's fine.
- Damn.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.385
That is like...
woo.

36:58.468 --> 36:59.303
It's okay.

36:59.386 --> 37:00.804
That'll leave a bruise, man.

37:00.888 --> 37:02.264
It'll be all right.
It's a good one...

37:06.894 --> 37:08.729
Good job, you earned it. Thanks.

37:09.771 --> 37:10.856
See you later,
all right.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.150
Take care of that
fucking eye, all right.

37:13.233 --> 37:14.943
See you.

37:15.027 --> 37:16.695
Yeah.

37:16.778 --> 37:17.613
See you, Manny.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.573
Put steak on that, bro.

37:19.656 --> 37:20.490
Yeah.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.708
Is this a new show?

37:31.585 --> 37:32.711
I don't know.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.763
Will you be getting home early
tonight?

37:46.058 --> 37:47.434
I'll do my best, but...

37:47.518 --> 37:49.353
I have an appointment with
the doctor today.

37:51.188 --> 37:53.607
Just stay home where you belong.

37:54.816 --> 37:56.151
We never spend time together
anymore.

37:56.735 --> 37:58.403
That's not true, Grandma.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.991
You always miss the
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i>.

38:05.577 --> 38:09.039
Maybe if you watched something
more exciting, I'd come home earlier.

38:33.939 --> 38:34.773
Hello?

39:05.387 --> 39:06.889
Nice hologram.

39:06.972 --> 39:07.890
Looks legit.

39:17.691 --> 39:19.776
Over the time you were here,

39:19.860 --> 39:22.779
were you horribly frightened,

39:22.863 --> 39:26.617
terribly threatened,
about living illegally

39:26.700 --> 39:28.243
in the United States?

39:42.758 --> 39:44.343
Are you happy?

39:44.426 --> 39:45.886
Define happiness.

39:46.929 --> 39:49.598
I can't define happiness
except for myself.

39:50.849 --> 39:51.934
Okay.

39:52.017 --> 39:55.312
What is happiness for you?

39:55.395 --> 40:02.319
Happiness for me is waking
up next to my wife,

40:03.403 --> 40:09.326
seeing the success of
my children, grandchildren.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.120
Loving my work.

40:15.415 --> 40:17.501
That's beautiful.
Thank you.

40:17.584 --> 40:18.752
I'm serious.

40:21.755 --> 40:23.507
Okay.
I gotta go...

40:23.590 --> 40:25.050
Hey.

40:25.133 --> 40:26.093
Can I come in?

40:28.262 --> 40:29.513
- This is awesome.
- Yeah?

40:29.596 --> 40:31.557
Yeah, you're saving my ass.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.600
You have no idea.
Thanks.

40:33.684 --> 40:35.185
I'm so grateful for this.

40:35.269 --> 40:38.397
All right, well, uh, I'll
get your paperwork filed

40:38.480 --> 40:42.192
and I'll send in to
payroll and like,

40:42.276 --> 40:43.861
by next week
you'll be all set.

40:43.944 --> 40:45.070
Okay.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.238
Here's my green card.

40:46.321 --> 40:47.281
Oh, great.

40:49.950 --> 40:53.120
Is Jason gonna come down
and see you in action?

40:54.079 --> 40:55.038
I hope so.

40:55.122 --> 40:56.999
I mean, I texted him,
so...

40:57.082 --> 40:58.375
All right. Well,

41:00.919 --> 41:01.837
let's get started.
Come on.

41:01.920 --> 41:02.754
All right.

41:02.838 --> 41:03.922
After you.

41:10.637 --> 41:11.513
Excuse me.

41:13.974 --> 41:15.017
That's you.

41:15.100 --> 41:15.934
Yeah?

41:16.018 --> 41:18.395
Can I get a vodka martini?

41:18.478 --> 41:19.354
Okay.

41:46.131 --> 41:46.965
Thanks.

41:58.101 --> 41:58.936
Whiskey.

41:59.019 --> 42:00.687
I don't have change,
is that my tip?

42:00.771 --> 42:01.980
Absolutely.

42:03.065 --> 42:03.899
In a cup.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.067
You sure?

42:05.150 --> 42:06.527
I can give you a cup.

42:08.362 --> 42:09.196
Sure.

42:18.413 --> 42:19.373
On the rocks?

43:07.629 --> 43:10.883
I have to get up early
for work tomorrow.

43:10.966 --> 43:11.925
Okay.

43:15.804 --> 43:16.930
I'll walk you out.

43:35.991 --> 43:37.409
Hello?

43:37.492 --> 43:38.535
Tina.

43:38.619 --> 43:40.037
Oh, hi, Dr. Cleary.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.331
This is Dr. Cleary.

43:42.414 --> 43:43.957
Just a second.

43:47.461 --> 43:48.712
Can you hear me now?

43:48.795 --> 43:56.553
Now, based on
my evaluations,

43:56.637 --> 44:01.850
I am able to confirm that
you have gender dysphoria.

44:03.310 --> 44:04.561
You may seek treatment.

44:32.339 --> 44:33.590
As NYPD Officers

44:33.674 --> 44:35.926
Bowman and Killeen head
to court to face charges

44:36.009 --> 44:37.970
in the brutal beating
of 27-year-old

44:38.053 --> 44:39.930
transgender woman
Rosemarie Jimenez,

44:40.013 --> 44:41.974
many local grassroots
organizations

44:42.057 --> 44:43.600
are coming
out in support of her.

44:43.684 --> 44:47.479
We will not rest until
we see justice for Rosie.

44:47.563 --> 44:50.941
Until all trans people
are allowed to walk down

44:51.024 --> 44:52.776
the street comfortably.

44:52.860 --> 44:55.821
We are too often victims
of violence and abuse,

44:55.904 --> 44:59.616
we experience discrimination
on a daily basis.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.952
The homicide rate in
the transgender community

45:02.035 --> 45:04.371
is the highest it's
been in its second year.

45:05.706 --> 45:08.292
These are evils that
threaten our lives

45:08.375 --> 45:10.210
and we want to protect it.

45:10.711 --> 45:12.462
It ends here.

45:12.546 --> 45:13.797
Now.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.633
Thank you so much.

45:17.426 --> 45:20.179
This is Tricia Berman
for Channel 14 News.

45:30.105 --> 45:32.649
Hmm.

45:32.733 --> 45:34.026
Is it gonna hurt?

45:34.109 --> 45:34.943
It won't.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.278
No worries.

45:46.580 --> 45:47.789
Oh, God.

45:51.919 --> 45:53.003
Hey, Tina.

45:53.378 --> 45:54.213
You doing all right?

45:54.296 --> 45:55.839
Yeah, I'm okay.

45:55.923 --> 45:56.882
I hate blood.

45:56.965 --> 45:58.467
I know, you look so nervous.

45:58.550 --> 46:00.719
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

46:00.802 --> 46:02.346
Yeah, I hope so.

46:02.429 --> 46:03.680
Just breathe.

46:03.764 --> 46:04.973
It's almost over.

46:05.057 --> 46:05.891
Okay.

46:05.974 --> 46:07.184
All right, I'll see
you real soon.

46:07.267 --> 46:08.185
Okay.

46:08.268 --> 46:09.102
Thank you.

46:11.313 --> 46:14.191
We will start with
a testosterone blocker

46:14.274 --> 46:15.609
before moving on to estrogen.

46:15.692 --> 46:16.527
Okay.

46:16.610 --> 46:17.903
Now, let's discuss
the changes

46:17.986 --> 46:19.446
that you should expect.

46:19.530 --> 46:20.364
All right.

46:20.447 --> 46:23.867
Breast growth,
enlargement of nipples,

46:23.951 --> 46:25.577
redistribution of body fat,

46:25.661 --> 46:27.162
and thinning of the skin.

46:28.121 --> 46:29.873
We will then prescribe
a similar dose

46:29.957 --> 46:31.542
of anti-androgens to prevent

46:31.625 --> 46:34.878
the formation of testosterone
in your body.

46:34.962 --> 46:39.925
And pro-estrogens for
thyroid and bone health.

46:40.008 --> 46:41.802
Do you have any
questions at this point?

46:41.885 --> 46:46.181
Uh, how big will
my breasts get?

46:47.015 --> 46:50.394
Well, I can't absolutely
predict that.

46:50.477 --> 46:54.064
And it will take at least
a month or two before you

46:54.147 --> 46:56.775
start seeing any
difference so you have to

46:56.859 --> 46:58.443
patient with the process.

46:58.527 --> 46:59.361
Okay.

46:59.444 --> 47:00.571
Okay?

47:00.654 --> 47:03.198
And I just need you
to know that this will

47:03.282 --> 47:04.992
require multiple
visits because

47:05.075 --> 47:07.244
I will need to keep
an eye on your

47:07.327 --> 47:09.079
liver and kidney functions

47:09.162 --> 47:11.248
and would like you to
be regularly seen by

47:11.331 --> 47:16.086
specialists given the
risks factors involved.

47:16.837 --> 47:17.838
I understand.

47:46.909 --> 47:48.452
The biller will be in
touch but Dr. Brown

47:48.535 --> 47:50.871
just wanted you to be aware
of what you can expect.

47:50.954 --> 47:51.955
Okay...

47:59.129 --> 48:00.380
That's a lot of money.

48:01.798 --> 48:03.342
There are many
steps involved.

48:04.343 --> 48:06.595
And without insurance,
we'll need to require

48:06.678 --> 48:09.264
full payment in cash upfront
on your next visit.

48:13.936 --> 48:14.770
Okay.

48:15.979 --> 48:16.813
Have a nice day.

48:16.897 --> 48:17.731
Thanks.

48:17.814 --> 48:18.649
You too.

48:25.697 --> 48:26.532
Hi.

48:27.908 --> 48:28.742
Hello.

48:38.168 --> 48:41.213
And, can I get
a scratch off please?

48:41.296 --> 48:44.675
Ah, which one?

48:44.758 --> 48:45.592
Hmm.

48:46.385 --> 48:47.928
The one that'll give
me the most money.

48:56.562 --> 48:58.021
Ah, Win for Life.

48:58.105 --> 48:59.648
You're thinking big,
aren't you?

48:59.731 --> 49:01.650
I'll tell you what,
if I do win,

49:01.733 --> 49:03.527
I'll split it with
you two ways.

49:03.610 --> 49:04.444
Deal?

49:04.945 --> 49:05.904
Okay.

49:05.988 --> 49:07.197
Do you believe me?

49:09.741 --> 49:11.535
Uh, 12 dollars.

49:11.618 --> 49:12.661
Okay.

49:21.003 --> 49:22.004
All right.
Thanks.

49:22.087 --> 49:22.921
Thanks.

49:23.005 --> 49:23.964
Have a good one.

50:13.055 --> 50:13.889
Yo.

50:15.516 --> 50:16.517
Are you selling the car?

50:16.600 --> 50:17.434
What?

50:17.518 --> 50:19.019
Are you selling the car?

50:19.937 --> 50:21.438
Oh, uh...

50:21.522 --> 50:22.731
yeah.

50:22.814 --> 50:23.649
You wanna take
a look at it?

50:23.732 --> 50:24.566
Yeah.

50:27.528 --> 50:32.199
It's kind of dirty,
but I can clean that up.

50:34.743 --> 50:36.119
She got a lot of
miles on it.

50:36.203 --> 50:37.579
Yeah.

50:37.663 --> 50:39.790
I drive around all day,
so...

50:39.873 --> 50:40.749
What you asking?

50:42.042 --> 50:43.043
Twenty-one hundred.

50:44.837 --> 50:46.421
I can give you
eight hundred cash.

50:46.505 --> 50:47.339
Eight hundred?

50:47.422 --> 50:48.298
Eight hundred.

50:48.382 --> 50:50.425
No way, it's taxi
registered.

50:50.509 --> 50:51.343
This is gold.

50:51.426 --> 50:53.637
Eight hundred cash right now.

50:53.720 --> 50:54.680
No.

50:54.763 --> 50:55.597
I'm okay.

50:57.307 --> 50:58.475
I guarantee you're
not gonna get

50:58.559 --> 50:59.685
a better deal than that.

51:00.394 --> 51:01.478
No.

51:01.562 --> 51:02.396
I'll try.

51:03.230 --> 51:04.690
All right,
you got a pen?

51:05.065 --> 51:06.608
Check by the glove box.

51:08.861 --> 51:10.279
Eight hundred?
That's nothing.

51:12.906 --> 51:14.157
When you figure out
that's what she's worth,

51:14.241 --> 51:15.450
just give me a call,
all right?

51:29.381 --> 51:30.549
Oh, Grandma

51:32.301 --> 51:34.344
Why are you selling the car?

51:39.558 --> 51:41.310
I'm gonna bartend for Kevin.

51:41.393 --> 51:43.645
I don't need the taxi anymore.

51:45.355 --> 51:47.649
And that'll support us?

51:48.650 --> 51:50.611
Yeah, it'll support us.

51:54.323 --> 51:57.618
How can you
work without papers?

51:57.993 --> 51:59.745
That's never been a problem.

52:00.746 --> 52:03.081
It's very
simple.

52:03.165 --> 52:06.418
The solution to all
our problems is to...

52:06.502 --> 52:07.920
"Go back to Mexico."

52:08.003 --> 52:11.131
Exactly! Now you get it.

52:35.280 --> 52:36.281
Hello?

52:40.494 --> 52:41.411
Hello?

52:49.211 --> 52:50.045
Chris.

52:52.005 --> 52:53.090
Coming.

52:53.674 --> 52:55.092
- We got customers.
- Yeah, yeah.

52:55.175 --> 52:56.176
I'm coming. Come on.

53:01.849 --> 53:05.602
Your field has really
expanded over the last decade.

53:05.686 --> 53:06.645
Tell me how so.

53:07.020 --> 53:09.940
Well, very interestingly
I've been very fortune

53:10.023 --> 53:13.777
to be working with the
transgender community to

53:13.861 --> 53:16.029
support them in their
vocal transition.

53:16.446 --> 53:18.282
Can you talk to us
a little bit about

53:18.574 --> 53:20.534
what this process looks like?

53:20.617 --> 53:21.451
This is how we do it,

53:21.535 --> 53:23.453
we start small - allowing our

53:23.537 --> 53:26.832
clients to become aware
of their overall

53:26.915 --> 53:29.376
vocal qualities
and their discomfort

53:29.459 --> 53:33.380
and then we work on relieving
tension through breathing

53:33.463 --> 53:36.383
exercises and work
on strengthening

53:36.466 --> 53:41.346
and balancing through
a series of vocal exercises.

53:41.430 --> 53:43.515
Working with these clients
has given me some of the

53:43.599 --> 53:48.604
most rewarding moments
of my career.

54:07.080 --> 54:10.792
The purpose of this exercise
is to relax your mind,

54:10.876 --> 54:12.169
and to guide you to create

54:12.252 --> 54:15.839
your own peaceful,
safe place.

54:15.923 --> 54:16.965
Easier said than done.

54:17.049 --> 54:17.883
Shh.

54:17.966 --> 54:19.259
Just concentrate.

54:19.593 --> 54:21.929
Continue to breathe slowly.

54:24.431 --> 54:25.432
Gently.

54:28.435 --> 54:29.770
Comfortably.

54:30.771 --> 54:32.105
Take a deep breath.

54:32.272 --> 54:35.776
In and out.

54:37.736 --> 54:39.738
When you're ready to
return to your day,

54:39.821 --> 54:43.242
file away this imaginary
place in your mind,

54:43.325 --> 54:46.745
waiting for you the next
time you need it.

54:49.122 --> 54:50.499
I'm gonna need it.

54:51.083 --> 54:52.793
That's what it's there for.

54:53.335 --> 54:55.045
But keep with you that
feeling of calm

54:55.128 --> 54:57.297
as you return to
your everyday life.

54:58.298 --> 54:59.216
Okay.

54:59.591 --> 55:00.425
That was nice.

55:00.509 --> 55:01.385
Yeah. Good.

55:01.468 --> 55:02.970
We're making progress.

55:03.804 --> 55:05.222
Now that you're relaxed,

55:06.348 --> 55:08.267
let's try some exercises.
Okay.

55:08.350 --> 55:11.979
So that I can evaluate
the quality of your voice.

55:14.690 --> 55:16.441
Hmm.

55:16.525 --> 55:17.734
I can be pretty loud.

55:17.818 --> 55:19.987
Oh, you want that
corrected too?

55:20.696 --> 55:22.281
No way.
Good.

55:22.364 --> 55:24.700
It's good to
have a loud voice.

55:25.492 --> 55:26.827
It's good to be heard.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.203
Exactly.

55:29.830 --> 55:30.873
All righty.

55:32.708 --> 55:34.585
Let's start a few exercises.

55:35.335 --> 55:37.588
How about raspberries?

55:38.463 --> 55:40.048
- Really?
- Really.

55:40.132 --> 55:42.009
It stretches the muscles.

55:42.593 --> 55:43.802
Okay.
Okay.

55:44.678 --> 55:48.599
I know it's silly.

55:48.682 --> 55:49.975
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

55:50.058 --> 55:50.893
Okay.

55:53.061 --> 55:54.646
No, no.

55:58.734 --> 56:00.110
That's it.

56:00.194 --> 56:02.821
How about a couple
tongue trills.

56:02.905 --> 56:04.281
Oh, okay.

56:04.364 --> 56:05.240
I know a good one.

56:05.616 --> 56:06.909
Grandma taught me.

56:07.201 --> 56:14.333
Perfect.

56:14.416 --> 56:16.418
What do you even
need me for?

56:17.377 --> 56:18.504
Trust me, doc.

56:18.587 --> 56:19.463
I need you.

56:20.631 --> 56:21.924
I need this.

56:22.382 --> 56:23.217
Fair enough.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.636
The important
thing is that

56:25.719 --> 56:28.722
we train you not to
strain your voice.

56:30.724 --> 56:31.558
Okay.

56:31.642 --> 56:32.601
Let's keep going.

56:32.684 --> 56:33.519
Okay.

56:33.602 --> 56:34.978
- Raspberry.
- Again?

56:35.062 --> 56:39.816
Okay.

56:39.900 --> 56:41.568
Okay. I got my practice
in for the day.

56:44.238 --> 56:45.155
Girl, you sound good.

56:45.239 --> 56:46.782
Keep it up.
Thank you, Demos.

56:50.577 --> 56:53.330
Girl, why are you
always on your phone?

56:57.459 --> 57:00.671
He hasn't returned any
of my calls all week.

57:00.754 --> 57:01.797
Oh, shit.

57:02.256 --> 57:03.298
Call him now.

57:06.009 --> 57:06.844
No.

57:06.927 --> 57:08.595
I've texted him plenty
of times already.

57:08.679 --> 57:11.181
Ugh. But that's
why you call him, honey.

57:11.265 --> 57:13.058
He has to hear
your voice....

57:17.896 --> 57:20.983
Oh honey. Honey.

57:21.066 --> 57:23.193
You don't let a man get
you upset like that.

57:23.277 --> 57:24.653
It ain't worth it.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.118
He loves me.

57:55.851 --> 57:57.477
Do you need some help?

57:59.354 --> 58:03.066
Of course, sweetheart.

58:03.150 --> 58:05.444
Better late than never.

58:10.657 --> 58:13.368
You're finally getting good at
this.

58:14.203 --> 58:16.288
Better late than never.

58:17.039 --> 58:20.334
What did I tell you?
Do as I say, not as I do.

58:20.959 --> 58:23.128
So, I shouldn't cook like you?

58:23.462 --> 58:25.756
No, that you should do.

58:25.839 --> 58:27.466
My food is delicious.

58:27.549 --> 58:29.676
Ask anybody in the neighborhood.

58:30.135 --> 58:31.512
You're right.

58:31.595 --> 58:34.765
You know where we could get the
best food in the world?

58:35.557 --> 58:36.850
Where?

58:39.770 --> 58:40.812
Grandma, please.

58:40.896 --> 58:42.606
In Mexico!

58:43.732 --> 58:47.194
Yeah, yeah, yeah... We'll spend
the rest of our days in Mexico.

58:47.277 --> 58:50.739
Sitting in the garden, drinking
sangria.

58:50.822 --> 58:54.201
We could live a very tranquil
life...

58:55.035 --> 58:57.913
Simple, without complications.

58:57.996 --> 59:00.457
And you wouldn't get in trouble.
Grandma, please.

59:01.416 --> 59:03.293
Stop it!

59:09.967 --> 59:10.926
Antonio.

59:11.552 --> 59:12.553
What?

59:13.428 --> 59:15.264
Will you give me a hug?

59:20.269 --> 59:23.522
But if you burn this food,
I'll kill you.

59:35.033 --> 59:36.910
Jason,
can I talk to you?

59:36.994 --> 59:37.828
Sorry, busy.

59:37.911 --> 59:38.829
Jason.

59:39.913 --> 59:41.748
What the fuck are
you doing here?

59:41.832 --> 59:42.666
This is my job.

59:42.749 --> 59:44.168
We talked about this.

59:44.251 --> 59:45.127
Really?

59:45.210 --> 59:47.129
You haven't talked
to me in days.

59:47.212 --> 59:49.131
You can't just barge up
to me at my fucking job

59:49.214 --> 59:50.424
whenever you feel like.

59:50.507 --> 59:51.341
I don't know what
you think this is

59:51.425 --> 59:53.260
but it isn't a relationship.

59:53.844 --> 59:55.012
So, what?

59:55.095 --> 59:56.597
Two years like that?

59:57.681 --> 59:59.141
I can't believe you.

59:59.850 --> 01:00:02.186
It's fine, okay?

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.353
Get yourself some therapy,

01:00:03.437 --> 01:00:05.355
get whatever body parts you want

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:07.441
and leave me the
fuck out of your mess.

01:00:08.775 --> 01:00:10.110
What a fucking asshole?

01:00:10.194 --> 01:00:11.653
- Fuck you!
- Whatever!

01:00:11.862 --> 01:00:13.697
Don't come back
to my job again!

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:14.865
It's over!

01:00:14.948 --> 01:00:16.200
Fuck him!

01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:18.160
Seriously,
fuck him!

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:19.328
I always knew there was

01:00:19.411 --> 01:00:21.163
something about
him that was off.

01:00:21.246 --> 01:00:23.457
I mean, you're out here
taking on the big city,

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:27.127
organizing huge rallies
and he runs off?

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.590
That's exactly
where I went wrong.

01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:34.092
Maybe I should have
never been doing...

01:00:34.176 --> 01:00:35.385
Hey.

01:00:35.469 --> 01:00:38.722
You did nothing wrong.

01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:42.059
You're better off
without his sorry ass.

01:00:42.142 --> 01:00:43.727
He had a weird face anyway.

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:46.897
Like, his nose, it looked
all funny and weird...

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:52.152
Hey!

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.446
Mr. Right will come along.

01:00:55.822 --> 01:00:57.991
Mr. Right is out
there for you.

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:01.036
Yeah?

01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:02.663
But what about him?

01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:05.040
Why can't he see me?

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:11.004
I see you and
you're beautiful.

01:02:24.578 --> 01:02:26.830
It smells so good!

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.045
It's a special request.

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:34.630
From who?

01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:36.548
Go to the patio.

01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:47.100
Surprise!

01:02:48.936 --> 01:02:50.854
Wow, you guys!
You're big 3-0!

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.190
You really shouldn't have!

01:02:53.273 --> 01:02:54.233
Wow!

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:56.485
You guys are just looking
for an excuse to party.

01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:58.529
Duh,
story of my life!

01:02:58.612 --> 01:03:00.197
My birthday isn't
until two weeks.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.115
Have a seat.

01:03:04.243 --> 01:03:06.161
Sit down.

01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:08.205
Can I have rice, please?

01:03:08.288 --> 01:03:10.332
Which I've been
doing out here with the fork.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:11.792
Setting out?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:12.876
What did you guys get me?

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.127
Some rice?

01:03:16.964 --> 01:03:19.383
Oh, my god,
so I have to make a toast.

01:03:19.466 --> 01:03:20.384
Is this gonna be long?

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:21.718
- C'mon, guys.
C'mon.

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:23.136
Put this on.

01:03:23.846 --> 01:03:25.222
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:26.723
Put it on right now.

01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:27.641
It's your day.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:28.892
You're the princess.

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:29.810
How does it look?

01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.186
I know you were
a little nervous

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:33.981
when I invited you to
my crazy little group,

01:03:34.273 --> 01:03:35.566
but you've just...

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:36.984
you've thrived.

01:03:37.442 --> 01:03:38.360
I'm gonna cry.

01:03:38.986 --> 01:03:41.238
Girl, you cry at everything.

01:03:41.321 --> 01:03:42.239
Let me do the toast, okay?

01:03:42.322 --> 01:03:43.532
Ah, excuse me.
To...

01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:44.575
I've known her way longer.

01:03:44.658 --> 01:03:46.076
I get to go first.

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.744
Okay, fine.

01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:53.584
To our Tina for
overcoming so much,

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:55.919
for showing the
world who we are,

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:57.713
people to be proud of.

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:01.842
Happy 30th birthday!

01:04:03.552 --> 01:04:06.013
Grandma, what's wrong?

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:09.016
You're forgetting to say grace.

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:11.185
We don't have to
do that right now.

01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:14.188
There are a lot of things
to be thankful for.

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:17.482
Okay, we'll do it.

01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:20.444
She says
we have to do grace.

01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:21.528
Who's Grace?

01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.988
No, silly.

01:04:23.071 --> 01:04:24.448
We have to pray.

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:25.449
For what?

01:04:25.532 --> 01:04:27.951
So we can eat!

01:04:28.035 --> 01:04:28.911
Okay, cool.

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:39.254
Thank you Lord, for all these gifts,
and this food that you have given us.

01:04:39.963 --> 01:04:43.091
In Christ, our Lord. Amen.

01:04:43.842 --> 01:04:44.676
Amen.

01:04:45.928 --> 01:04:47.638
That was nice.

01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:02.444
Do you have a knife?

01:05:02.528 --> 01:05:03.362
Yes, of course.

01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:05.739
You speak Spanish!

01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:07.157
Yeah, a little bit.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.451
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:10.536
Be careful.

01:05:10.953 --> 01:05:12.871
Can I ask you a question?

01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:14.373
Yes, Mami.

01:05:14.456 --> 01:05:17.000
Let's sit down for a second.

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:23.006
Tell me.

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:33.851
Have you been through this too?

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:38.313
Been through what?

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.527
If you've... changed...

01:05:43.819 --> 01:05:46.363
Oh, yeah, yeah!

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:50.075
It's just...

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:53.412
Antonio doesn't
tell me anything.

01:05:54.162 --> 01:05:57.124
I don't know why
he wants to do it.

01:05:58.876 --> 01:06:02.129
That's not the question
you should be asking.

01:06:03.213 --> 01:06:05.090
What do you mean?

01:06:06.592 --> 01:06:08.135
Do you love Tina?

01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:11.513
With all my heart.

01:06:12.222 --> 01:06:15.559
Well, instead of asking 'Why'...

01:06:16.685 --> 01:06:21.648
Why don't you ask if she's
happy?

01:06:29.907 --> 01:06:31.909
Well, I gotta get back.

01:06:32.659 --> 01:06:34.328
The girls need to eat.

01:06:34.411 --> 01:06:37.831
Yes, yes. Of course!

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:50.719
Yes!

01:06:50.802 --> 01:06:51.637
Blow it.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.638
Let there be light.

01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:53.555
Oh, my gosh.
There we go.

01:06:53.639 --> 01:06:55.432
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:56.934
Make a wish.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:57.976
Let me think of it.
Let me think.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:58.977
Let's protect the flame.

01:06:59.061 --> 01:07:00.062
We'll protect it.

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:03.190
That's cute.
I like that.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:16.453
Hey, this is Tina.

01:07:16.537 --> 01:07:17.788
I'm not available right now.

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:20.374
Please leave your name
and number, I'll...

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:17.741
Oh, shit.
I swear to fuckin' god.

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:19.117
Whoa. Oh.

01:09:19.201 --> 01:09:20.493
Is that Chrisy?

01:09:20.577 --> 01:09:21.411
Look at that.

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:22.621
What the fuck?

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:23.662
Oh, my god.
Oh, shit.

01:09:23.747 --> 01:09:24.581
He got a clean cut!

01:09:24.665 --> 01:09:26.250
What the fuck?

01:09:27.334 --> 01:09:28.585
We've got a fucking skinhead!

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:30.127
Rub his hair for good luck...

01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:32.756
You feel like a new man,
right? Let's go.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.006
You ready for the game?

01:09:34.675 --> 01:09:36.635
Right You better be ready, bro.

01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:51.524
Okay.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:52.693
All good.

01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:57.364
Sign this for you...

01:10:00.117 --> 01:10:00.951
Okay.

01:10:01.034 --> 01:10:02.160
You'll take good
care of her?

01:10:02.244 --> 01:10:03.203
Absolutely.

01:10:04.037 --> 01:10:04.955
All right.

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:06.665
She's in good hands.

01:10:06.748 --> 01:10:07.875
I hope so.

01:11:12.523 --> 01:11:13.941
Hi. I'm here for-

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:16.360
Ah, thank you.

01:11:16.652 --> 01:11:17.653
We'll call you back.

01:11:18.612 --> 01:11:19.863
Hi, I'm here for Dr. Brown.

01:11:19.947 --> 01:11:20.822
I have the money.

01:11:26.745 --> 01:11:28.121
What's the matter?

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:32.793
Have a seat, Tina.

01:11:37.214 --> 01:11:38.215
How are you feeling?

01:11:38.298 --> 01:11:39.132
Fine.

01:11:39.216 --> 01:11:40.551
Good.

01:11:40.634 --> 01:11:43.303
So, what's up, doc?

01:11:44.805 --> 01:11:47.432
We received the results
from your tests

01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:50.143
and it appears that
you have a disorder

01:11:50.227 --> 01:11:52.563
known as
Wilson's Disease.

01:11:54.022 --> 01:11:55.232
Okay.

01:11:55.315 --> 01:11:56.358
What does that mean?

01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:59.069
It means that
you are possibly

01:11:59.152 --> 01:12:02.239
predisposed to liver disease.

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:04.116
The good news
is that for you

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.910
it is not life threatening.

01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:08.954
And it can be treated
with medication

01:12:09.037 --> 01:12:12.165
and it must be treated
with medication, okay?

01:12:12.249 --> 01:12:17.921
And unfortunately
there are high levels

01:12:18.005 --> 01:12:20.591
of copper in your liver

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:23.927
and your body just will
not be able to support

01:12:24.011 --> 01:12:27.014
the hormone dosage that
is needed for transition.

01:12:29.016 --> 01:12:30.267
I'm sorry, Tina.

01:12:32.978 --> 01:12:34.188
There's gotta be
a mistake.

01:12:34.271 --> 01:12:35.814
Maybe you can do
something else.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:37.024
That- No, no, no, no.
You can do it over.

01:12:37.107 --> 01:12:37.941
But...
You have to...

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:38.942
There must be wrong.
No.

01:12:39.026 --> 01:12:40.444
Sweetheart,
we have to look out

01:12:40.527 --> 01:12:41.778
for your overall health.

01:12:41.862 --> 01:12:43.697
No!

01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:46.575
Tina, listen to me.

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:50.829
It's very good we caught
this in time.

01:12:51.705 --> 01:12:54.374
I'm so sorry-
I never get to...

01:12:54.458 --> 01:12:55.709
You have your life.

01:12:57.461 --> 01:12:59.004
I'll never...

01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:31.638
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

01:14:31.722 --> 01:14:34.183
Trans haters
have got to go.

01:14:34.266 --> 01:14:40.731
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:42.232
We're here
at a demonstration

01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:43.942
for Rosemarie Jimenez.

01:14:44.026 --> 01:14:45.569
We're just moments
away from hearing

01:14:45.652 --> 01:14:47.905
whether the jury will
choose to indict

01:14:47.988 --> 01:14:50.741
NYPD officers
Bowman and Killeen.

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:51.742
The crowd behind me

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:53.577
is patiently awaiting
the hearing...

01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:55.412
Trans haters
have got to go.

01:14:55.495 --> 01:14:57.414
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

01:14:57.497 --> 01:14:59.583
Trans haters
have got to go.

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.502
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

01:15:18.352 --> 01:15:21.104
Tina, where are you, girl?

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:23.190
I've been calling
you all day.

01:15:24.691 --> 01:15:25.984
Call me back.

01:15:32.157 --> 01:15:33.450
Are you guys ready?

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:35.202
Yeah!

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:36.119
Justice!

01:15:36.203 --> 01:15:37.120
Justice!

01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:38.247
Justice!

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.248
Justice!

01:15:39.331 --> 01:15:40.457
Justice!

01:15:40.541 --> 01:15:41.458
Justice!

01:15:41.542 --> 01:15:42.376
What do we want?

01:15:42.459 --> 01:15:43.293
Justice!

01:15:43.377 --> 01:15:44.378
When do we want it?

01:15:44.461 --> 01:15:45.462
Now!

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:46.964
Justice for Rosie!

01:15:47.047 --> 01:15:49.049
Justice for Rosie!

01:15:58.725 --> 01:16:00.727
Fucking good.

01:16:00.811 --> 01:16:01.645
Oh, yes, bro.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:03.188
You're fucking good.

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:04.106
Here, man.

01:16:04.898 --> 01:16:06.483
Here, man.
Have another drag.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:09.570
You all right?

01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:19.830
You all right, man?
Man, you gotta focus.

01:16:19.913 --> 01:16:24.126
Oh, shit.

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:25.502
Now, what?

01:16:25.586 --> 01:16:30.174
Oh shit, it's that
fucking she-male.

01:16:30.257 --> 01:16:31.175
Yo, let's get her.

01:16:31.258 --> 01:16:32.759
Yeah, let's fuck with
this fucking dick girl.

01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:33.927
Oh hell yeah.

01:16:36.638 --> 01:16:38.265
Hey baby girl,
you need a ride?

01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:40.309
How about you
show us them titties?

01:16:40.392 --> 01:16:41.226
Shake 'em, around.

01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:42.978
I want to see if those
things are real.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.899
C'mon, let's see them,
ya dick girl, bitch.

01:16:46.982 --> 01:16:48.192
C'mon, don't treat
us like that, baby.

01:16:48.275 --> 01:16:49.568
We take care of you.

01:16:49.651 --> 01:16:50.777
C'mon.

01:16:53.447 --> 01:16:54.990
We're gonna rub
that mangina of

01:16:55.073 --> 01:16:56.241
yours like it's our own.

01:16:56.325 --> 01:16:57.326
Show us something.

01:16:57.409 --> 01:16:58.243
Wow, wow.

01:16:58.327 --> 01:17:00.329
Yo, Chris...

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:29.900
what are you doing man?

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:31.026
The fuck you doing, bro?

01:17:31.109 --> 01:17:32.152
Get in the car.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:39.826
Oh shit! Chris,
what the fuck!

01:17:40.661 --> 01:17:42.246
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:42.329 --> 01:17:43.163
STOP!...

01:17:43.497 --> 01:17:44.540
Go!

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.902
I'm sorry...

01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:28.917
I'm sorry.

01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:14.296
Ma'am,
I need to know his name.

01:19:18.133 --> 01:19:19.510
I can't...

01:19:22.387 --> 01:19:24.014
I can't.

01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:00.717
Ma'am.

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:03.679
Please.

01:20:04.638 --> 01:20:06.056
What's his name?

01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:19.945
Tina.

01:20:20.028 --> 01:20:21.905
Tina Carrera.

01:20:46.930 --> 01:20:47.764
Ma'am!

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.474
Ma'am!

01:20:49.808 --> 01:20:50.642
Ma'am!

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:53.395
We found this envelope in her
purse.

01:20:53.478 --> 01:20:54.938
It has your name on it.

01:20:58.442 --> 01:20:59.902
Take good care of yourself,
ma'am.
