WEBVTT

00:07.540 --> 00:08.620
(train horn blowing)

00:08.820 --> 00:09.990
MANNY:
<i>Back in my using days,</i>

00:10.190 --> 00:11.390
<i>I was like a runaway train.</i>

00:11.590 --> 00:13.560
<i>Once I started, I couldn't stop.</i>

00:13.760 --> 00:16.930
What I've learned
in these rooms is that

00:17.130 --> 00:20.430
we're as sick
as our secrets, you know?

00:20.630 --> 00:23.270
And my secrets
didn't just hurt me,

00:23.470 --> 00:26.870
they hurt my daughter

00:27.070 --> 00:29.280
and my friends.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.500
But when I was ready
to ask for help...

00:34.030 --> 00:36.930
...those friends
trusted me enough...

00:39.670 --> 00:41.120
...to lend me money

00:41.320 --> 00:44.960
and to put a roof over my head
while I got back on my feet.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.890
They treated me like family.

00:47.090 --> 00:50.030
<i>Their son, he's one</i>
<i>of my inmate firefighters.</i>

00:50.230 --> 00:52.800
<i>Came to my fire camp</i>
<i>a broken man,</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:55.430
<i>but now he's found something</i>
<i>to live for because</i>

00:55.630 --> 00:58.170
<i>he just got</i>
<i>his parole hearing date.</i>

00:58.370 --> 01:00.320
<i>He's so close to getting out.</i>

01:01.120 --> 01:03.180
This is how I'm gonna repay
his parents,

01:03.380 --> 01:04.910
by making sure
that their son paroles

01:05.110 --> 01:06.310
and gets back home
to them.

01:06.510 --> 01:09.370
By minimizing his risk
on the job...

01:10.930 --> 01:14.940
<i>...and making sure nothing</i>
<i>knocks him off track.</i>

01:20.880 --> 01:23.300
Now, your friends
and that inmate firefighter

01:23.500 --> 01:24.950
under your wing...

01:26.220 --> 01:30.040
...they're really lucky to have
a man like you in their lives.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.940
I'm the lucky one.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.010
I'm Faye.

01:34.210 --> 01:35.170
I'm Manny.

01:35.370 --> 01:36.910
You know, every time you share,

01:37.110 --> 01:38.560
it sticks with me.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.450
(soft chuckle,
clears throat)

01:42.650 --> 01:44.350
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

01:44.550 --> 01:46.140
trying to right my wrongs,
you know?

01:48.040 --> 01:49.360
You know, I can help you

01:49.560 --> 01:51.570
with repaying the money
you owe them.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.130
I could triple your pay.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.100
I'm founder and CEO

01:56.300 --> 01:57.730
of Nozzle
Fire Suppression.

01:57.930 --> 02:00.200
The concierge fire company.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.830
For a minute there,

02:02.030 --> 02:03.770
I thought you were
flirting with me.

02:03.970 --> 02:05.100
Mm.

02:05.300 --> 02:07.810
I do like to mix business
with a little pleasure.

02:08.010 --> 02:10.110
(chuckles)

02:10.310 --> 02:12.750
Yeah...

02:12.950 --> 02:16.120
You know, private firefighting,
it's not really my thing.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.650
I believe in protecting life
and property for everybody,

02:18.850 --> 02:19.920
not just millionaires.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.090
Okay, be fair.
I protect billionaires, too.

02:23.290 --> 02:24.790
(laughs)

02:24.990 --> 02:27.790
Top of the line engines, tech,

02:27.990 --> 02:30.780
copters, and me.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.680
Enticing.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.140
But I think I'm gonna stick
to my convictions

02:39.340 --> 02:40.510
and my convicts.

02:40.710 --> 02:43.340
Think about it.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.060
Both my propositions.

02:48.860 --> 02:50.900
(dance music playing faintly)

02:52.170 --> 02:54.900
Let's go, baby, here we go!
(whooping)

02:56.610 --> 02:58.190
VINCE:
Take the shot!

02:58.390 --> 02:59.530
How do you not
take that shot?

02:59.730 --> 03:01.490
(laughs) 'Cause my team's
locked in, baby.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.000
Nine days.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.570
No, the Final Four's
in, like, a few weeks.

03:06.770 --> 03:07.970
No, no, no, I'm saying
nine days it's been

03:08.170 --> 03:09.900
since I was accused
of being an arsonist,

03:10.100 --> 03:11.570
and you haven't even
apologized to me.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.070
EVE: Well,
I didn't accuse you.

03:13.270 --> 03:15.240
No, and you didn't
defend me, either.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.110
You didn't even ask
to see how I was doing.

03:17.310 --> 03:19.210
When's the last time
you asked me how I'm doing?

03:19.410 --> 03:21.510
Okay, Eve, how you been?

03:21.710 --> 03:22.920
I'm genuinely asking.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.680
EVE:
Since Rebecca, not great,
but I started

03:25.880 --> 03:27.320
following Chief's order:

03:27.520 --> 03:29.690
"Fire. Family. Beer. Repeat."

03:29.890 --> 03:31.320
You should try it.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.990
I thought we were family, too.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.840
You were unavailable.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.970
AUTOMATED VOICE (over phone):
You have a call from...
Bode Leone.

03:41.170 --> 03:44.100
...an inmate at the California
Department of Corrections.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.100
(line rings)

03:46.310 --> 03:49.110
(phone ringing)
Oh, that's the Bode ring.

03:49.310 --> 03:50.810
Uh... where's my phone?

03:51.010 --> 03:53.750
Pass the ball. Pass the ball!
Will you just turn it lower?

03:53.950 --> 03:56.200
'Cause that's Bode calling.
I'm gonna miss it.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.550
(phone beeps)
AUTOMATED VOICE:
To accept, press one.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.790
Oh!
(phone beeps)

04:02.990 --> 04:04.760
Bode Boy,
are you there?

04:04.960 --> 04:06.830
BODE (over phone):
Yeah, yeah. Hi, Mom.

04:07.030 --> 04:09.060
Is, uh, is Dad there, too?

04:09.260 --> 04:12.130
Uh, everyone's here.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.150
I, uh...

04:15.920 --> 04:17.900
...got a letter
from the parole board today.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.190
And?

04:21.260 --> 04:22.640
I got my hearing date.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.440
Ah! Yes, yes, yes! When?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.550
It's, uh... 60 days.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.580
(cheering)

04:30.780 --> 04:32.720
SHARON:
Bode!

04:32.920 --> 04:35.350
That's... that's good, Bodie,
that's really good.

04:35.550 --> 04:36.890
You're a softie.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.760
Look, i-i-it's just a hearing,
you know, there's...

04:39.960 --> 04:41.230
there's no guarantees.

04:41.430 --> 04:43.200
Oh, no, no, no,
come on.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.660
When they see all the progress
that you've made,

04:45.860 --> 04:48.100
they are gonna
release you right away.

04:48.300 --> 04:51.400
That's why we are doing
a happy dance right now.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.540
(cheering)

04:54.740 --> 04:56.840
What are we celebrating?
Ah.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.480
Lilly, uh, Bode got
a parole hearing.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.550
I didn't even know
you were coming.

05:01.750 --> 05:03.780
Oh, yeah, neither did I.
Hey, Mom.

05:03.980 --> 05:04.980
No.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.020
LILLY: That's wonderful
for Bode, Sharon,

05:07.220 --> 05:10.660
but my son was accused of arson,
and you didn't call me?

05:10.860 --> 05:12.890
I am so sorry.

05:13.090 --> 05:14.560
Well, I'm all ears now.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.230
BODE:
Well, it, uh, sounds like

05:16.430 --> 05:17.830
you guys have a lot
going on over there.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.770
So, uh,
so I'll call back tomorrow.

05:19.970 --> 05:23.350
No, no, no, wait, wait,
Bode, Bode, wait, wait.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.690
I'm gonna do the dishes.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.210
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This call will end
in three minutes.

05:33.410 --> 05:36.480
Hey, I can tell you're not
happy dancing over there

05:36.680 --> 05:38.150
by the sound of your voice.

05:38.350 --> 05:40.820
This isn't my first
parole hearing.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.620
You know,
I lost the last one and...

05:43.820 --> 05:45.490
I could lose this one, too.

05:45.690 --> 05:47.360
I just don't want
to get hopes up.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.180
Not even mine?

05:51.410 --> 05:53.780
Especially yours, Gabriela.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.770
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This call will end
in two minutes.

05:57.970 --> 05:59.670
(train horn blowing in distance)

05:59.870 --> 06:01.410
(sniffles)

06:01.610 --> 06:04.010
(clears throat) You know what?

06:04.210 --> 06:07.810
If I, uh, if I do parole,
I'm... (sighs)

06:08.010 --> 06:10.550
I'm weirdly nervous
about that, too.

06:10.750 --> 06:12.390
Bode, this is...

06:12.590 --> 06:15.290
this is everything
we've been looking forward to.

06:15.490 --> 06:17.290
Us finally being together.

06:17.490 --> 06:21.460
Yeah, I know, and I-I want that,
I want that so badly,

06:21.660 --> 06:24.530
but fire camp is good for me,

06:24.730 --> 06:26.970
and I'm kind of scared

06:27.170 --> 06:28.530
who I'll be without it.

06:28.730 --> 06:31.190
(train horn blowing in distance)

06:33.320 --> 06:35.390
(dance music playing)

06:36.760 --> 06:38.310
GIRL:
Why aren't we moving?

06:38.510 --> 06:40.610
BOY:
Let's go. We have a prom
to get to.

06:40.810 --> 06:42.850
(overlapping chatter)

06:43.050 --> 06:45.080
(train horn blowing)

06:45.280 --> 06:47.840
GIRL: No, seriously,
why aren't we moving?

06:48.840 --> 06:50.020
Yo, is that a train?

06:50.220 --> 06:52.690
Move the bus! Go!
Move!

06:52.890 --> 06:54.560
Come on, come on.
(train horn blaring)

06:54.760 --> 06:56.260
(train brakes screeching)

06:56.460 --> 06:58.160
That screeching
doesn't sound right.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.570
What's happening?
I don't know.

07:00.770 --> 07:02.400
I-I think it's a...
Bode?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.070
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This call will now
be disconnected.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.240
(thudding, glass shattering)

07:06.440 --> 07:08.060
Train crash.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.430
(muffled screaming)

07:21.640 --> 07:23.870
(crying)

07:27.680 --> 07:29.910
* *

07:41.990 --> 07:43.830
(high-pitched ringing)

07:53.770 --> 07:56.250
(girl crying)
(boy moaning)

07:56.450 --> 07:58.640
BOY 2:
Get out of there!

07:59.780 --> 08:00.960
ROBIN:
No, no, no, no, no, no.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.850
It's a bus full of kids?

08:05.250 --> 08:08.170
Somebody help!

08:08.370 --> 08:09.570
Please, somebody!

08:09.770 --> 08:11.200
(overlapping shouting)

08:11.400 --> 08:12.890
Help!

08:15.390 --> 08:16.640
GIRL 2:
Help us!

08:16.840 --> 08:18.840
BODE: Train wreck, guys.
This could be gnarly.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.350
TROY:
Sounds like a horror film.

08:20.550 --> 08:22.480
GIRL:
Oh, my God!

08:22.680 --> 08:25.570
Whoa. Oh, my God.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.390
GIRL 2: Hello?

08:27.590 --> 08:30.360
Help us.
Go, go, go.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.530
BOY: Help!
We're stuck in here. Help!

08:32.730 --> 08:34.090
(indistinct chatter)

08:34.290 --> 08:35.960
BOY 3: Dude, my legs.
I can't feel my legs!

08:36.160 --> 08:38.930
Greencrest,
Three Rock Crew Four.

08:39.130 --> 08:41.230
MCI.

08:41.430 --> 08:42.940
Train hit a party bus.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.900
I was in a prom bus like this
with my homies just last year.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.240
Hey, Bode.
Yeah?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.910
This driver, man...

08:50.110 --> 08:52.090
I think he's dead, bro.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.740
(sighs)

09:07.910 --> 09:10.230
Hey, Cashen.
Cashen, we got one deceased,

09:10.430 --> 09:11.930
a bunch of kids
thrown from the bus,

09:12.130 --> 09:13.170
and some still inside.

09:13.370 --> 09:14.870
We need ambulances,
and right away.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.540
We need everything.
Hey, guys, guys,

09:17.740 --> 09:20.470
let's get some extinguishers
on that fire. Lonnegan,

09:20.670 --> 09:21.870
see if you can get
one of these doors open.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.790
Can't. The bus landed
on the doors.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.550
Well, we need more hands.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.420
ROBIN:
I can lend one.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.550
Train hit his brakes
out of nowhere.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.150
Are there any
other passengers?

09:36.350 --> 09:37.660
Uh, just me and the cargo.

09:37.860 --> 09:39.420
There's a bunch of prom kids
on the bus.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.230
I take it you weren't
going to prom.

09:41.430 --> 09:44.130
Go by Robin.
Bode.

09:44.330 --> 09:48.030
Greencrest, I repeat,
this is an MCI situation.

09:48.230 --> 09:49.530
We got a lot
of victims here.

09:49.740 --> 09:51.340
We got a lot of...
MAN: I smell
burning flesh.

09:51.540 --> 09:53.310
We got a lot of blood.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.240
Whoa, hey, hey, hey,
oh, oh, ooh. What?

09:56.440 --> 09:58.210
He's fainting on us?

09:58.410 --> 10:00.710
GREENCREST (over radio):
Three Rock,
repeat your last request.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.900
Message incomplete.
Three Rock?

10:05.100 --> 10:07.250
Greencrest,
this is inmate Leone.

10:07.450 --> 10:09.390
Our CO is passed out.

10:09.590 --> 10:11.290
And we got...

10:11.490 --> 10:13.190
we got one patient deceased,

10:13.390 --> 10:14.790
about a dozen need extrication.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.530
Bus is still on fire. Uh...

10:16.730 --> 10:17.930
I don't even know
where to begin.

10:18.130 --> 10:20.230
SHARON: Greencrest,
this is D.C. Leone.

10:20.430 --> 10:21.900
First, you take
a breath, Bode.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.070
Someone from the bus
already called.

10:24.270 --> 10:25.340
We're on our way
to you.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.270
LONNEGAN:
(panting) Bode.

10:27.470 --> 10:28.970
Fire's not giving up easy.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.510
Uh, yeah. Hey.

10:30.710 --> 10:33.150
Please, please hurry.
I'm in over my head.

10:33.350 --> 10:35.780
You know what to do
with fire: put it out.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.350
BODE:
Yeah, I'm-I'm trying.

10:37.550 --> 10:38.950
Hey, guys, guys, we got to get

10:39.150 --> 10:40.690
more extinguishers.
Get that fire out.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.120
Copy.
SHARON: And then,
when the fire is out,

10:42.320 --> 10:44.690
you need to ventilate the bus.
Smash windows.

10:44.890 --> 10:47.290
Leone, you can
absolutely do this.

10:47.490 --> 10:49.430
Yeah. Copy, Chief.

10:49.630 --> 10:51.860
Hey, Freddy, we got to vent
this thing. Toss me a tool.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.130
Here you go.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.100
Hey. Hey! Hey, guys, we need
you to step back.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.670
Okay? Get back from the window.
FREDDY: Watch your eyes,
watch your eyes.

10:56.870 --> 10:58.000
BODE:
Okay, ready?
Ready.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.270
One, two,

10:59.470 --> 11:00.340
three.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.790
(kids exclaiming)

11:03.790 --> 11:05.540
Jake, you're with me on 1568.

11:05.740 --> 11:08.110
Eve, Perez,
take the big engine.

11:08.310 --> 11:09.950
I'm glad to see
you trust me again.

11:10.150 --> 11:12.120
You're pissed at me,
I know.
Pissed?

11:12.320 --> 11:15.520
Vince, you were my only father
figure after my dad passed,

11:15.720 --> 11:18.060
and I know you got your
real son back now, but...
Hey.

11:18.260 --> 11:20.660
Sharon and I have always loved
you like a son, you know that.

11:20.860 --> 11:23.600
When I needed you,
you let me down.

11:23.800 --> 11:26.050
(engine starts)

11:27.020 --> 11:29.570
By the way, I wasn't the
only one that needed you.

11:29.770 --> 11:30.870
The advice
you gave Eve--

11:31.070 --> 11:32.910
fire, family,
beer, repeat--

11:33.110 --> 11:35.270
it doesn't seem
to be working.

11:35.470 --> 11:37.440
Advice?

11:37.640 --> 11:39.640
She must've only
heard the first part.

11:39.850 --> 11:42.200
That was a cautionary tale.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.150
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

11:46.350 --> 11:47.820
Come on!

11:48.020 --> 11:50.120
Finally,
let's go.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.320
Almost left you.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.790
Let's go.

11:53.990 --> 11:55.290
BODE (over radio):
<i>We got 15 kids in here.</i>

11:55.490 --> 11:56.590
<i>Various injuries. Some critical.</i>

11:56.800 --> 11:59.430
SHARON: I tried
to protect him.

11:59.630 --> 12:01.030
I'm Jake's mother.

12:01.230 --> 12:02.500
Don't forget that.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.590
You-you are. You're a great
mother. I overstepped.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.270
You know, you have your own son.

12:08.470 --> 12:09.610
And my son?

12:09.810 --> 12:11.740
He does not look like Bode,

12:11.940 --> 12:14.280
and he does not share
your privilege, Sharon,

12:14.480 --> 12:15.550
and he had to deal

12:15.750 --> 12:17.600
with that investigation.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.590
Oh, you're so right.
He-he doesn't,

12:20.790 --> 12:21.890
and he was cleared.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.220
Yeah, the accusation's
been made.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.060
Right.
And you can't unring that bell.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.840
No.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.980
Let's go help people.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.070
Okay.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.270
(engine starts)

12:36.470 --> 12:38.350
(siren wailing)

12:39.320 --> 12:41.210
BODE:
Train hit this party bus
at almost full speed,

12:41.410 --> 12:43.280
but it took it a few
hundred more feet to stop.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.140
Thank God, Cap's here.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.210
Let's get these kids
away from these flames.

12:47.410 --> 12:48.750
Hey, Bode.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.280
I heard the call and raced over.
Where you at?

12:50.480 --> 12:52.120
We got this fire out,
helping these kids out here,

12:52.320 --> 12:53.720
but there's still more
that are trapped on the bus.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.890
All right,
well handled.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.250
All right, Three Rock,
let's regroup.

12:56.450 --> 12:57.460
Let's clear out this debris

12:57.660 --> 12:58.990
for D.C. Leone
and crew. Let's move.

12:59.190 --> 13:01.530
Greencrest,
Division 1501.

13:01.730 --> 13:04.360
Assuming County Road
136 I.C.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.900
GREENCREST:
Copy that, 1501.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.100
We have a code on
these trains to help.

13:09.300 --> 13:10.370
You gonna help
those kids?

13:10.570 --> 13:12.860
Yeah, that's kind of the gig.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.170
He was first one off the train.

13:16.370 --> 13:17.840
Clued us in
to who needed help.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.980
Your friendly neighborhood
train hopper?

13:21.180 --> 13:22.480
That's my guess.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.880
42, shore up this bus,

13:24.080 --> 13:25.320
and I need these spot fires out.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.990
Chief, I need you, Edwards,
Crawford on the bus.

13:29.190 --> 13:30.160
Yeah. Same page.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.460
Dr. Crawford,

13:31.660 --> 13:33.560
let's go assess the
conductor of this train.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.380
Copy that.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.220
Cap, hey,
where do you want me?

13:41.220 --> 13:43.340
You heard me, clearing debris.

13:43.540 --> 13:44.870
What, you're sidelining me?

13:45.070 --> 13:48.340
Bode, I've seen too many guys
with short time left

13:48.540 --> 13:50.580
go south on calls. Not you.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.710
Not on my watch.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.330
No risks.
Keep it simple, all right?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.190
VINCE: All right,
the bus is vented.

14:01.390 --> 14:03.740
Get those kids out
with the jaws, Eve.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.800
(hisses, grunts) Get some.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.230
JAKE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.430
It's "Get some, be safe."

14:16.630 --> 14:17.840
Like you told me
in training, remember,

14:18.040 --> 14:19.500
"Slow is smooth
and smooth is fast."

14:19.700 --> 14:21.260
I'm tired of going slow.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.680
(grunts)

14:25.880 --> 14:27.330
(kids crying)

14:29.100 --> 14:31.920
All right, kids,
we're gonna get you out.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.100
(crying)

14:38.540 --> 14:40.730
Perez, more med bags.
Go.

14:40.930 --> 14:42.380
On it, Chief.

14:44.680 --> 14:45.830
SADIE:
Rafa?

14:46.030 --> 14:47.870
Raf-Rafa's my boyfriend.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.840
(crying): I can't see
him. Is he okay?

14:51.040 --> 14:53.640
Sadie, don't worry.

14:53.840 --> 14:57.510
These firefighters are gonna get
us all out of here in one piece.

14:57.710 --> 14:58.990
Right?

15:08.540 --> 15:09.490
VINCE:
That's great, Eve.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.760
Keep it steady.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.360
All right, spine boards next,
probie. Go.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.790
Copy, Chief.
Okay, what's your name?

15:15.990 --> 15:16.860
Zoey.

15:17.060 --> 15:18.700
All right, Zoey,
do me a favor,

15:18.900 --> 15:20.620
keep some pressure
on this, will you?

15:22.580 --> 15:24.000
RAFAEL: Hey, the
pole feels hot.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.720
Whoa, whoa, hold up, hold up.
The saw's heating up the pole.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.270
JAKE: Come on,
this should help.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.740
VINCE:
You know that's
not gonna work.

15:30.940 --> 15:32.710
Just stop cutting for a second.
Let it cool down.

15:32.910 --> 15:34.110
Well, I have to keep going.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.180
No, not if it's gonna

15:35.380 --> 15:36.250
burn him from the inside out.

15:36.450 --> 15:37.950
I said hold the work, Edwards.

15:38.150 --> 15:40.870
The pole is too hot.

15:42.970 --> 15:44.840
Watch your step.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.330
Hey, Cap, I need extra hands

15:48.530 --> 15:50.480
boarding a patient.
Can I take Leone?

15:53.280 --> 15:56.450
Fine. Report to me right after.

15:58.350 --> 16:01.440
Hey. We were
interrupted. You okay?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.480
I'm good.
Thanks for pulling me in.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.890
Can't be sitting on my hands
when I could be helping.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.380
(Bode grunts)

16:09.580 --> 16:10.970
Thanks.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.090
Hi, guys. Hi, I'm Bode.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.260
Uh, this is Gabriela.
Hey.

16:18.460 --> 16:20.190
We're gonna help
you guys out, okay?

16:20.390 --> 16:23.760
(grunts, stammers)
I'm-I'm Sadie.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.400
Can't believe
this is happening.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.470
(crying): I'm s-supposed
to be at prom right now,

16:28.670 --> 16:31.900
taking pictures
under some cheesy balloon arch.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.940
And now, it's
just... it's gone.

16:35.140 --> 16:37.490
No prom.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.810
Next, Rafa and I
worked our asses off,

16:41.010 --> 16:43.620
and we got scholarships
to Stanford together.

16:43.820 --> 16:45.350
Can't live for the future,
all right?

16:45.550 --> 16:47.470
You got to focus
on what's here and now.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.810
Is Rafa gonna be okay?

16:52.640 --> 16:53.830
My crew's working to get him

16:54.030 --> 16:55.690
out of there
as fast as they can, okay?

16:55.890 --> 16:57.100
(crying)

16:57.300 --> 16:59.200
Can you remember what happened?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.300
We were dancing, and then...

17:01.500 --> 17:04.140
I guess the bus just got stuck.

17:04.340 --> 17:07.110
And-and then the train came.

17:07.310 --> 17:11.280
Okay, just... just stay with us
here, now, all right?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.480
Hey, you heard my dad.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.310
You're supposed to return
and go clear debris.

17:16.510 --> 17:18.250
I'm not paroling yet.

17:18.450 --> 17:19.780
Job's to help,
so I'm gonna help.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.350
SADIE:
Thank you, Bode.

17:21.550 --> 17:22.900
Yeah.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.710
I blew the whistle.

17:28.140 --> 17:29.160
Tried to brake.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.460
No one's blaming you
for this.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.170
Bus was on the tracks,

17:35.370 --> 17:37.090
wasn't moving.

17:37.950 --> 17:41.170
Hitting people on the tracks
is my nightmare,

17:41.370 --> 17:43.310
and they're kids.

17:43.510 --> 17:46.080
It's hard to stop a freight
train on short notice, sir.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.700
Don't blame yourself.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.590
It's not always
accurate.

17:53.790 --> 17:55.290
The train manifest?

17:55.490 --> 17:58.140
(sighs) Kids can't be here.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.290
(sighs) You need to move them.

18:02.490 --> 18:03.660
SHARON:
Move them?

18:03.860 --> 18:06.230
We all need to get away
from the cargo.

18:06.430 --> 18:08.300
Everyone. Please.
Hey.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.470
No one is blaming you for
this, but it is serious.

18:11.670 --> 18:14.110
We have patients here
who we need to stabilize

18:14.310 --> 18:16.840
before we can move.
Do you understand that?

18:17.040 --> 18:19.080
Sir, keep your
head still, please.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.210
My ears are ringing.

18:20.410 --> 18:22.410
This doesn't list enough cargo

18:22.610 --> 18:23.920
for a train this size.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.120
That's why you need
to move those kids,

18:27.320 --> 18:28.600
now.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.890
Hey, Bode.

18:32.090 --> 18:34.160
I thought I told you to report
back to me after your assist.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.190
Breaking the rules could
jeopardize your parole, man.

18:36.390 --> 18:39.230
What's more important? My parole
or helping people who need me?

18:39.430 --> 18:40.930
Bode.
MANNY: It was an order,

18:41.130 --> 18:42.670
not a request.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.440
Don't look at me.
That's your cap. You heard him.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.820
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:53.430 --> 18:55.610
Hey. So what, you're just-just
gonna basically arrest me

18:55.810 --> 18:56.780
for the next 60 days?

18:56.980 --> 18:58.720
No, that would be my job.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.120
You salty 'cause you fainted?

19:00.320 --> 19:01.120
What'd you say?

19:01.320 --> 19:02.890
Respect.

19:03.090 --> 19:04.190
Understood, Cap.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.910
Hey, you better
watch yourself, Leone.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.800
You good, bro?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.900
Yeah.
Is that a burn?

19:14.100 --> 19:15.670
Yeah.

19:15.870 --> 19:17.400
MANNY:
Look at that.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.040
It's a fuel burn.
How'd you get that?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.110
Train car
next to me was leaking.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.370
Which one, that one?

19:22.570 --> 19:23.610
Yeah, that one right there.

19:23.810 --> 19:25.760
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.

19:31.700 --> 19:32.820
(siren whoops)

19:33.020 --> 19:35.320
It's time for Robin to fly.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.450
You heading home?

19:36.650 --> 19:38.260
Road's my home now.

19:38.460 --> 19:39.770
I get that.

19:40.640 --> 19:43.660
Hey, but I can't
take this with me.

19:43.860 --> 19:45.810
It'll trace me back
to some business.

19:46.850 --> 19:48.720
Good luck, man.

19:52.450 --> 19:53.890
Goat.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.380
Goat, will you, uh...
you take that?

19:57.580 --> 19:58.930
Yeah.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.620
D.C. Leone, we've got
some sort of fuel leak

20:06.820 --> 20:08.950
in one of these train cars here.

20:09.150 --> 20:10.290
What's leaking?

20:10.490 --> 20:12.010
I-I don't know.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.630
I can't say.

20:14.830 --> 20:16.360
Yeah? If it could harm a kid,

20:16.560 --> 20:18.430
you want to have that
on your conscience?

20:18.630 --> 20:20.630
It's a mystery cargo.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.730
My boss pays me
to look the other way and...

20:22.930 --> 20:24.470
then he loads it up with
explosives, chemicals.

20:24.670 --> 20:25.800
I never know.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.160
But it's always bad.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.840
What's going on with his ear?

20:33.040 --> 20:34.960
LILLY:
He's bleeding.
Swabbing with gauze.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.380
Ah, that's
a halo sign.

20:39.580 --> 20:41.690
He must have torn his
dura when he hit his head.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.460
We need to get
our conductor onto the rig.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.360
He's leaking
cerebrospinal fluid.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.110
I'll deal with the other leak.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.830
SHARON (over radio):
I'm enacting hazmat protocol.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.730
The train is leaking
flammable fluid.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.300
Hey, hey, hey. Stop the saw.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.800
Stop the saw.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.900
Any sparks that fly
could ignite that leak.

20:57.100 --> 20:59.300
Before you get me out of here?
JAKE:
Hey, no, no, no, no.

20:59.500 --> 21:00.770
Listen, we will get you out.

21:00.970 --> 21:02.610
VINCE:
Guys, be cautious,

21:02.810 --> 21:04.860
because bad just got worse.

21:05.790 --> 21:07.680
Any patients in that bus

21:07.880 --> 21:10.280
that can be transported,
move them to Three Rock,

21:10.480 --> 21:12.680
as deep as you can, now.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.350
What did the manifest say?

21:14.550 --> 21:17.150
It doesn't matter. Whatever's in
there is not on the manifest.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.840
MANNY:
All right, Bode. Hit it.

21:20.610 --> 21:21.590
Nice.

21:21.790 --> 21:22.830
Got it.

21:23.030 --> 21:24.400
Huh.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.150
Show me your guts.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.300
Jet fuel.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.010
You got to be kidding me.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.190
The fire possibility here makes
this a ticking time bomb, Chief.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.720
Be a leader over there.
Copy, Cap.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.430
All right, I got my guys taking
patients over to Three Rock

21:53.630 --> 21:54.830
as fast as they can.

21:55.030 --> 21:56.890
Okay, let's reroute
the ambulances there.

21:57.090 --> 21:59.360
You want to triage kids
at an inmate camp?

21:59.560 --> 22:01.200
Well, it's either that
or next to jet fuel

22:01.400 --> 22:02.830
that could blow at any moment.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.440
Inmate camp it is.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.000
What do we have
on hand for hazmat?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.040
Use the SCBA masks.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.570
Guys, every single person

22:09.770 --> 22:11.710
needs to get the hell away
from this cargo now.

22:11.910 --> 22:13.710
Hey. What's the ETA
on Rafael?

22:13.910 --> 22:16.380
EVE (over radio):
Progress is slow
with just a handsaw.

22:16.580 --> 22:18.720
Okay, keep at it.
No power tools.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.790
Well, if we can't move the kid
away from the fuel,

22:20.990 --> 22:22.690
how about we move the fuel
away from the kid?

22:22.890 --> 22:26.420
Not a bad idea, but do you know
how many tons that thing is?

22:26.620 --> 22:27.760
Engine alone
is not gonna tow it.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.360
What if we just
move the cargo,

22:29.560 --> 22:31.060
then we dispose of it properly?

22:31.260 --> 22:33.430
What about the copter?

22:33.630 --> 22:35.330
Secure the fuel
and airlift it out?

22:35.530 --> 22:38.270
(grunts) Our ship's
committed to a rescue,

22:38.470 --> 22:39.500
out of unit,
and our reserve

22:39.700 --> 22:41.410
doesn't have any
nighttime capabilities.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.810
I know somebody who can help.

22:44.010 --> 22:45.180
(line ringing)

22:45.380 --> 22:47.330
(Manny clears throat)

22:51.370 --> 22:53.600
(subdued chatter)

23:00.810 --> 23:02.990
This is the last of the kids.

23:03.190 --> 23:04.780
Thank you, firefighter.

23:09.380 --> 23:11.100
(sighs)
Well, they're all stable.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.600
And away from
the danger.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.670
Lilly, I'm so sorry.

23:15.870 --> 23:17.540
Every fiber of my being
wanted to believe

23:17.740 --> 23:19.410
that Jake could never
be the arsonist.

23:19.610 --> 23:21.910
But it-it's my own bias
that prevented me

23:22.110 --> 23:24.820
from seeing how much harder
this would be for your son

23:25.020 --> 23:27.000
than me or my son.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.990
I wish there hadn't been
so much evidence against him.

23:31.190 --> 23:32.560
What evidence?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.860
Well, he was framed,
and I should've seen past that,

23:35.060 --> 23:37.600
but when he lied about
being in Drake County,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.470
where the
arson was, I...

23:40.670 --> 23:42.470
I just couldn't see
up from down then.

23:42.670 --> 23:43.640
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.600
Did you say Drake County?

23:45.800 --> 23:47.440
(helicopter whirring)

23:47.640 --> 23:48.740
BODE: I didn't
realize that

23:48.940 --> 23:50.640
you had friends in
such high places.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.910
There's a lot you don't know
about me, Bode.

23:54.110 --> 23:55.430
Like what?

23:56.700 --> 23:57.950
Like the reason
I'm riding you so hard

23:58.150 --> 24:01.620
to stay safe is because
I made a vow, to your future.

24:01.820 --> 24:05.220
Make sure you get home
to your parents

24:05.420 --> 24:07.110
and to Gabriela.

24:09.910 --> 24:12.500
You know, running
into a wildfire,

24:12.700 --> 24:15.680
to me, is a lot less scary
than letting her down.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.560
What if I don't parole?

24:21.390 --> 24:22.710
Or what if I do...

24:22.910 --> 24:26.790
(grunts) ...and I fall apart
without fire camp?

24:28.560 --> 24:31.170
I mean, she...
she deserves so much.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.750
When you're out there, Bode,

24:36.950 --> 24:38.860
I'm not gonna be around
to believe in you.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.760
So you're gonna have to learn
to believe in yourself.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.150
Especially if you're gonna be
in my daughter's life.

24:46.110 --> 24:47.750
You'd be okay with that?

24:48.620 --> 24:49.830
If that's what she wants.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.600
You want to be
the man she deserves?

24:52.800 --> 24:55.060
Be the man I see.

24:55.990 --> 24:57.440
The man I know
you can be.

24:57.640 --> 24:59.690
The man that fire camp
made stronger.

25:00.460 --> 25:01.650
And let me look out for you

25:01.850 --> 25:04.030
and make sure you graduate
in 60 days.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.930
60 days, Bode.

25:12.940 --> 25:14.230
Rafael?

25:14.430 --> 25:15.690
You with me? He's fading!

25:15.890 --> 25:17.660
JAKE:
He's unconscious.
Give me the recip saw.

25:17.860 --> 25:19.700
No, no.
Chief said no power tools.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.270
Sparks could ignite
the fuel outside.

25:21.470 --> 25:23.900
Listen, he's gonna bleed out
while I cut this stripper pole

25:24.100 --> 25:25.070
with a butter knife.

25:25.270 --> 25:26.790
You want to risk his life?

25:29.760 --> 25:31.760
JAKE:
Come on, Rafael.
Stay with me, buddy.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.380
We move on my command.

25:36.580 --> 25:38.250
Abort on my command. Copy?

25:38.450 --> 25:41.620
FAYE (over loudspeaker):
Copy. Nozzle is happy
to assist Cal Fire.

25:41.820 --> 25:44.270
MAN:
Lowering payload hoist.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.620
Thanks for the
assist, Faye!

25:46.820 --> 25:48.210
FAYE:
You're welcome.

25:50.750 --> 25:53.030
Got it?
Yeah.

25:53.230 --> 25:54.850
(saw whirring)

25:59.020 --> 26:00.840
Got it.
All right.

26:01.040 --> 26:01.910
Okay, we cut
through the pole.

26:02.110 --> 26:03.340
Let's get Rafael
out of here.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.860
GABRIELA:
We got fire!

26:06.160 --> 26:07.650
Chief, we got fire,
and it's spread outside.

26:07.850 --> 26:09.110
Knew we shouldn't have
used that saw.

26:09.310 --> 26:11.420
Yeah, but it saved him.
Hey, save it.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.680
We got to get out of here now.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.540
All right, three, two, one.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.820
Eve. What happened?

26:20.020 --> 26:22.360
We got Rafa out
with the recip saw.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.230
I made the call.

26:24.430 --> 26:27.460
Tell me later. Making
other calls right now.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.580
(indistinct shouting)

26:32.590 --> 26:34.140
Fire's traveling.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.670
Headed towards the bomb.

26:35.870 --> 26:38.580
Choke it off! Choke it off!

26:38.780 --> 26:40.380
Abort. Cut the line.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.210
Everybody, evac now.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.310
Abort!

26:43.510 --> 26:44.850
You heard your dad!

26:45.050 --> 26:47.220
Evacuate!
Yeah, you heard him, too.
We could die.

26:47.420 --> 26:49.750
You're not dying
on my watch, Bode. Look at me.

26:49.950 --> 26:51.990
You're going home
in 60 days. You got that?

26:52.190 --> 26:53.860
You want to help
with the time you have left?

26:54.060 --> 26:56.160
Then you get my daughter
and everybody else

26:56.360 --> 26:58.650
the hell out of here, now!

27:03.450 --> 27:04.850
Dad!

27:11.460 --> 27:14.230
(grunting)

27:16.330 --> 27:17.880
Gab!

27:18.080 --> 27:20.120
Dad! Dad!
Hey. No, no, no, no, Gab, Gab.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.450
Bode!
Gab...

27:21.650 --> 27:23.320
Let me go. Let me go!

27:23.520 --> 27:25.760
I can't. I can't, okay?
I promised your dad.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.710
Please! Let me go! Dad!

27:35.550 --> 27:36.880
GABRIELA (crying):
No! Please!

27:48.100 --> 27:49.700
(grunts)

27:53.700 --> 27:56.450
All right, she's connected. Go!

27:56.650 --> 27:58.220
MAN (over radio):
Copy that.

27:58.420 --> 27:59.610
(grunting)

28:15.120 --> 28:16.690
(indistinct shouting)

28:17.860 --> 28:19.590
(crying):
Dad!

28:23.230 --> 28:25.180
(panting)

28:25.380 --> 28:28.950
Don't you ever do
that to me again.

28:29.150 --> 28:30.500
(exhales)

28:33.910 --> 28:35.780
(crying)
I'm okay.

28:39.610 --> 28:40.850
MANNY:
I'm okay.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.370
(exhales)

28:45.570 --> 28:48.020
(birds singing)

28:55.500 --> 28:57.850
That was a tough one, huh?

28:58.050 --> 28:59.350
Steel's forged in fire.

28:59.550 --> 29:01.820
You think we're steel?

29:02.020 --> 29:03.700
We're not steel.

29:04.770 --> 29:05.970
Eve.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.660
I'm worried about you.

29:08.860 --> 29:11.680
You should worry about Jake.
You guys owe him.

29:12.810 --> 29:14.130
Yeah, we do.

29:14.330 --> 29:17.770
I'm not sure how we're gonna
make up for that, but...

29:17.970 --> 29:19.640
Jake didn't come to me
a couple weeks ago

29:19.840 --> 29:22.620
asking for a leave of absence.

29:31.630 --> 29:33.350
But you told me that...

29:33.550 --> 29:36.020
I gave you some wrong advice.

29:36.220 --> 29:37.760
Okay? I'm sorry.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.320
I want go back.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.510
I want to accept your request.
I want you to...

29:43.380 --> 29:45.080
I want you to take
that leave you need.

29:47.050 --> 29:49.320
Is that an order?

29:52.220 --> 29:54.040
It's a plea,

29:54.240 --> 29:56.790
from somebody
who loves you.

29:58.760 --> 29:59.790
(sighs)

30:01.560 --> 30:03.330
Thanks, Chief.

30:06.530 --> 30:08.000
But I'm good.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.230
FREDDY:
Still holding that
train hopper's bag.

30:17.430 --> 30:19.530
Hey, golden boy.
Open it.

30:19.730 --> 30:22.130
You're not curious?

30:22.330 --> 30:24.520
Kind of forgot,
to be honest.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.000
Ooh.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.110
I guess "Robin"
stood for Robin Hood.

30:29.310 --> 30:30.980
More like Robbin' Banks.

30:31.180 --> 30:33.390
Yo, let's put this away.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.380
You trying to get in
trouble before your date?

30:36.580 --> 30:38.900
No. I'm really not.

30:40.230 --> 30:41.800
We ain't keeping it.

30:42.870 --> 30:44.660
Let's see if Manny
can help us out.

30:44.860 --> 30:45.960
You know, maybe we can
give it to those prom kids

30:46.160 --> 30:47.420
and set up a college fund
or something.

30:47.620 --> 30:49.960
Anonymous donor.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.300
Hi.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.380
Hi, Freddy.

30:57.620 --> 31:01.040
Um, can we talk?

31:01.240 --> 31:03.090
Yeah.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.600
(indistinct chatter)

31:16.270 --> 31:18.670
Thank you.
(sighs)

31:24.410 --> 31:26.700
Drake County.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.570
That's a long way from home.

31:28.770 --> 31:31.990
I've been meaning
to talk to you about it.

31:33.390 --> 31:35.440
Mother's intuition tells me

31:35.640 --> 31:38.460
I already know
what you're about to say.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.280
You-you knew?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.430
Tell me what you know.

31:49.300 --> 31:54.210
Mom, Dad was expecting
another baby, before he died.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.630
You knew already.

31:58.830 --> 32:02.530
And I have the bigger picture,
but right now, I am...

32:02.730 --> 32:04.870
still one step behind you.

32:05.070 --> 32:07.940
Tell me how you
knew about that.

32:08.140 --> 32:09.490
(sighs)

32:11.530 --> 32:13.240
I heard Dad on the phone.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.950
When I asked him about it,

32:16.150 --> 32:18.750
he told me we would talk
about it later, with you.

32:18.950 --> 32:20.650
So I...

32:20.850 --> 32:23.420
kept his secret this whole time.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.320
Mom, I'm-I'm so sorry.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.430
I mean, I-I don't even know

32:28.630 --> 32:30.360
how he could even
cheat on you, I just...

32:30.560 --> 32:33.980
No, no, no.
No, no. He didn't.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.470
(clears throat)

32:37.670 --> 32:41.270
He and I were living
under the same roof,

32:41.470 --> 32:43.440
but we were separating.

32:43.640 --> 32:45.780
Our marriage,
it was wonderful,

32:45.980 --> 32:48.110
but it was, it was
complete, honey.

32:48.310 --> 32:53.480
So we decided that we would end
on decent terms.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.120
He met someone first.

32:56.320 --> 32:57.520
And they had a baby.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.890
Yeah.

32:59.090 --> 33:01.080
A little boy.

33:03.310 --> 33:06.130
His mom and I...

33:06.330 --> 33:09.830
we decided that,
with your father gone,

33:10.030 --> 33:12.300
there was no reason to tell you.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.210
I mean...

33:15.410 --> 33:17.410
Was it the right choice?

33:17.610 --> 33:19.280
I still don't know.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.000
All these years...
(scoffs)

33:24.200 --> 33:26.300
...I kept his secret.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.420
Why would he ask me to do that?

33:30.620 --> 33:34.580
My little Peanut,
listen to me.

33:35.410 --> 33:37.430
I knew your father.

33:37.630 --> 33:41.770
He would never ask you
to keep a secret like that.

33:41.970 --> 33:44.240
This-- You were
just a kid.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.370
And we were going to tell you
all of this, together,

33:47.570 --> 33:49.020
but then he...

33:51.020 --> 33:52.960
He died.

33:53.790 --> 33:57.010
Yeah, baby. He did.

33:57.210 --> 34:00.080
He was a good man,

34:00.280 --> 34:01.690
and he loved you.

34:01.890 --> 34:05.710
Oh, he loved you so very much.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.390
And he was a hero.

34:08.590 --> 34:10.980
Know that.
Hmm.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.050
<i>(door opens)</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:30.860
Hey.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.550
Thank you
for the save out there.

34:34.750 --> 34:38.370
You dove on that fuel bomb
without blinking.

34:39.510 --> 34:42.430
Yeah, well, it was either me or
the inmate I'm trying to parole.

34:42.630 --> 34:45.880
So... no choice.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.080
Have you reconsidered
my offer yet?

34:55.520 --> 34:57.090
(clears throat)

34:59.860 --> 35:02.400
My mind hasn't changed.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.270
About the job.

35:08.570 --> 35:09.900
But...

35:11.470 --> 35:16.340
...I seem to remember
you made two offers.

35:23.150 --> 35:25.190
* *

35:39.970 --> 35:41.590
GABRIELA:
Ugh, I hate this.

35:41.790 --> 35:44.160
We start a conversation,
get cut off,

35:44.360 --> 35:46.920
and then we can't finish it
for hours.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.690
That's what I'm trying
to protect you from.

35:49.890 --> 35:52.030
The uncertainty,
lack of control.

35:52.230 --> 35:54.300
Did you just say
"protect" me?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.670
Is that why you held me back
last night?

35:56.870 --> 35:58.300
I don't need protection.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.040
I-I-- Look, I-I know that.
Then stop.

36:01.240 --> 36:04.680
Stop bracing, stop dwelling.
Stop killing my hope.

36:04.880 --> 36:06.440
My hope for us.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.810
It's hard.
Listen.

36:09.010 --> 36:10.510
Listen to me.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.100
I'm listening.

36:13.870 --> 36:16.240
We've talked about the what-ifs.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.840
Can we take a moment to talk
about the possibilities?

36:23.240 --> 36:25.480
Of parole?

36:27.310 --> 36:30.730
You. Me.

36:30.930 --> 36:33.300
A random Tuesday.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.460
I surprise you with takeout.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.030
Or I cook for you.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.780
I'm actually
one hell of a cook.

36:42.980 --> 36:44.680
You know that?

36:44.880 --> 36:47.300
Tell me.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.590
Reverse-seared steak.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.690
Wine.

36:51.890 --> 36:53.560
I'm wearing a dress.

36:53.760 --> 36:57.390
I'm wearing... not this.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.950
(both chuckle)

37:01.110 --> 37:04.100
Until neither of us

37:04.300 --> 37:06.390
are wearing anything at all.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.540
Bode,

37:13.740 --> 37:15.830
this is what hope feels like.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.900
I'll try to get used to it.

37:42.190 --> 37:44.930
("Hold On" by Alabama Shakes
playing)

37:47.830 --> 37:50.580
* Bless my heart *

37:50.780 --> 37:53.250
* And bless my soul *

37:53.450 --> 37:55.890
* I didn't think I'd make it *

37:56.090 --> 37:57.920
* To 22 years old *

37:58.120 --> 38:00.490
* You got to hold *

38:00.690 --> 38:02.840
(volume increases)

38:03.640 --> 38:05.480
* On... *

38:12.990 --> 38:16.220
Did you and Lilly
make up, or...?

38:18.160 --> 38:21.860
I owe her a really expensive
bottle of wine.

38:23.730 --> 38:24.980
(exhales)

38:25.180 --> 38:27.720
(groans) We get such
good news last night,

38:27.920 --> 38:32.460
and then we're, like, a breath
away from being blown up

38:32.660 --> 38:35.860
by a jet fuel bomb,
with all those innocent kids.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.830
I mean, when do we
get to stop living

38:38.030 --> 38:40.250
like the other
shoe's gonna drop?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.720
Guess we're both softies.

38:44.890 --> 38:49.410
I want him to parole so badly.
Right now, Vince. I...

38:49.610 --> 38:51.980
I know we have so much
to sort through with Jake,

38:52.180 --> 38:54.240
and we will, we
will do that work.

38:54.450 --> 38:55.610
But then...

38:55.810 --> 38:58.480
all of our kids--
all of our, uh...

38:58.680 --> 39:03.490
kids that we have a chance
to help-- will be okay.

39:03.690 --> 39:04.660
Um...
(sighs)

39:04.860 --> 39:06.190
(sighs)

39:06.390 --> 39:09.540
Not all the kids are okay.

39:11.980 --> 39:14.110
Something's going on with Eve.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.320
(grunts)

39:18.220 --> 39:20.140
She came to me, and...

39:20.340 --> 39:22.770
I guess I didn't see it.

39:22.970 --> 39:27.510
But I think something's been
brewing for a really long time.

39:27.710 --> 39:30.810
Well, she lost Rebecca
her first time

39:31.010 --> 39:32.350
leading an inmate crew,

39:32.550 --> 39:34.450
and she was really beating
herself up, but then...

39:34.650 --> 39:36.750
she's gone so quiet, I thought
she was doing her work.

39:36.950 --> 39:39.090
I thought she was better.

39:39.290 --> 39:40.720
I was wrong
about that, too.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.560
I was so worried about Bode,
and then worried about Jake.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.200
Yeah.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.680
We always expect Eve and Jake
to be self-cleaning ovens.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.170
Gabriela came to me and said

39:53.370 --> 39:58.210
that Eve's been hitting
the bars pretty hard.

39:58.410 --> 40:00.430
You think it's addiction?

40:01.630 --> 40:06.180
Self-medicating, um,
reclusiveness.

40:06.380 --> 40:11.190
Sounds like more, more of
a mental health struggle to me.

40:11.390 --> 40:12.790
Okay.

40:12.990 --> 40:16.610
So then, the other shoe
that's about to drop is Eve.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.400
* I don't know
where I'm gonna go *

40:19.600 --> 40:21.160
* Don't know what I'm gonna do *

40:21.360 --> 40:25.770
* There must be somebody *

40:25.970 --> 40:28.170
* Up above *

40:28.370 --> 40:30.070
* Saying, "Come on, Brittany *

40:30.270 --> 40:33.010
* You, you got to come on up" *

40:33.210 --> 40:38.380
* You got to hold *

40:38.580 --> 40:40.020
* On *

40:40.220 --> 40:41.550
(sniffles)

40:41.750 --> 40:43.020
* Whoo *

40:43.220 --> 40:48.930
* Yeah, you got to hold *

40:49.130 --> 40:50.960
* On *

40:51.160 --> 40:53.800
(moans)

40:54.000 --> 40:57.250
* "Yeah, you got to wait" *

40:58.990 --> 41:02.870
* But I don't want to wait *

41:03.070 --> 41:06.560
* No, I don't want to wait *

41:10.100 --> 41:13.270
* And you got to hold on. *
