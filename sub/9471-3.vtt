00:25.556 --> 00:26.807
Hmm...

00:28.693 --> 00:29.922
Mmm!

00:48.179 --> 00:52.515
(sultry jazz music playing)

00:56.588 --> 00:59.554
âŞ Hold me for the, hold
me for the moment âŞ

00:59.591 --> 01:00.840
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye!

01:00.892 --> 01:02.591
- Bye!
- Bye, Mom!

01:02.643 --> 01:05.027
- She looks good.
- She does look really good.

01:05.063 --> 01:06.295
So, first off, we have,

01:06.331 --> 01:07.995
um, tickle fight for the next two hours.

01:08.021 --> 01:08.563
Mm-hmm. Sure.

01:08.599 --> 01:09.853
So that's just you and me back and

01:09.879 --> 01:11.000
- forth tickle fighting.
- Got it.

01:11.034 --> 01:12.420
Hour two, we're
gonna wrap around the back

01:12.444 --> 01:13.868
of the couch and
we're gonna scratch at it.

01:13.905 --> 01:15.138
- Mm-hmm.
- So, really loose,

01:15.164 --> 01:16.472
really impromptu session

01:16.507 --> 01:17.606
of just scratching
the back of the couch.

01:17.632 --> 01:17.974
Mm-hmm.

01:18.009 --> 01:19.475
After that, we're
gonna play the ball game.

01:19.501 --> 01:20.075
Right, of course.

01:20.111 --> 01:21.611
- The little tiny ball.
- Yeah, the tiny ball.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.777
- Just bat it back and forth.
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.813 --> 01:25.414
And after that, we're
gonna go into a pre-lunch snack.

01:25.450 --> 01:27.049
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- A light thing of dry food

01:27.085 --> 01:28.551
- before we get into the wet food.
- I'm sorry.

01:28.585 --> 01:30.385
- Phil, I just need to interrupt you.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.655
Because I just want to
make sure that you know

01:32.689 --> 01:34.490
I do have something at 3:30.

01:34.525 --> 01:36.992
Something, meaning like...

01:37.027 --> 01:39.433
It's just something
I have in my calendar.

01:39.459 --> 01:40.329
Well, push it.

01:40.365 --> 01:41.364
- I can't....
- Well, push it.

01:41.399 --> 01:42.497
Look, I... You can't...

01:42.533 --> 01:44.033
- I'm sorry.
- You can't spring this on me!

01:44.067 --> 01:45.567
I... Look, I can't move it.

01:45.603 --> 01:46.344
- I... Mike!
- It's something

01:46.370 --> 01:47.302
that's very important to me.

01:47.337 --> 01:49.204
What is it that's so important?

01:49.240 --> 01:51.873
- You want me to tell you what it is?
- Yes, I wanna know!

01:51.908 --> 01:52.942
All right.

01:52.977 --> 01:57.412
At 3:30 today... I
have naptime with Phil.

01:57.448 --> 01:59.281
- (gasps)
- We're doing naptime today, man.

01:59.317 --> 02:01.316
I'm messing with you!

02:01.352 --> 02:03.019
- (sobbing)
- Oh, don't get upset.

02:03.054 --> 02:04.686
Don't get ups... No...

02:04.721 --> 02:06.121
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:06.156 --> 02:08.490
- That was a joke. It was a joke.
- No...

02:08.526 --> 02:10.592
- No, it was...
- I love you. Look at me.

02:10.627 --> 02:11.860
I love you.

02:11.896 --> 02:13.162
I love you so much.

02:13.197 --> 02:14.401
- I love you a lot.
- I love you so much.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.131
I just love you so...

02:15.165 --> 02:16.632
(knocking)

02:16.668 --> 02:19.935
Excuse me. Neighbors?

02:19.971 --> 02:21.503
- Whassup?
- Mike, who is that?

02:21.538 --> 02:23.139
Okay, I don't....
I'm not sure, actually.

02:23.163 --> 02:23.739
I don't know.

02:23.775 --> 02:25.174
I've never... What's happening?

02:25.209 --> 02:27.143
- No... Tell him to go away.
- Um...

02:27.177 --> 02:29.377
- No espeakay...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:29.413 --> 02:31.479
No espeakay Espańol.

02:31.515 --> 02:32.814
- No espeakay.
- Uh...

02:32.849 --> 02:34.884
- No, no, no, no, no...
- No espeakay!

02:34.918 --> 02:37.252
I'm your neighbor. I locked myself out.

02:37.288 --> 02:40.256
I just wouldn't mind using
your kitty litter.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.223
I'm prairie-dogging pretty hard.

02:42.259 --> 02:43.658
We've all been there.

02:43.694 --> 02:45.093
Okay, sir, um,

02:45.128 --> 02:46.453
you can understand we don't normally

02:46.478 --> 02:47.562
get visitors like this, so...

02:47.598 --> 02:50.231
I know I look like a
squatter or something.

02:50.268 --> 02:51.300
I live right next door.

02:51.335 --> 02:53.235
- I mean, I'm right...
- Oh, you're in 103?

02:53.271 --> 02:54.165
- Yes.
- We've never seen

02:54.191 --> 02:55.103
him before, though.

02:55.139 --> 02:57.673
Well, Mike, I would say, I've
never left the apartment.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.040
- Oh, that's true.
- So...

02:59.076 --> 03:00.300
We have not gone outside these walls.

03:00.324 --> 03:00.975
That's probably it.

03:01.012 --> 03:02.978
So, yeah, if I
could really get in there.

03:03.014 --> 03:04.379
I'm about to explode.

03:04.414 --> 03:05.548
Both: He's got to use the bathroom.

03:05.582 --> 03:06.915
I mean, this is just rude.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.480
This is just rude at
this point. Get in here!

03:08.506 --> 03:09.117
This is rude of us.

03:09.152 --> 03:11.219
Get in here, guy! Come in here!

03:11.271 --> 03:13.806
Neighborly, right? I
should have brought something.

03:13.858 --> 03:18.593
âŞ âŞ

03:24.786 --> 03:26.235
Oh...

03:26.287 --> 03:27.302
(gulps)

03:27.337 --> 03:28.704
(coughs)

03:28.740 --> 03:30.338
So, we were flying over Calgary, right?

03:30.373 --> 03:32.140
- And we was like...
- Yeah, we were right over there. Yeah.

03:32.175 --> 03:34.210
Yeah, and we saw this Boeing come by.

03:34.245 --> 03:36.478
- That's a plane.
- That's a big plane.

03:36.514 --> 03:37.812
Remember the big plane, Shane?

03:37.848 --> 03:39.414
- Yeah, the Boeing 747.
- Yeah.

03:39.449 --> 03:40.915
Okay, so he knows the deal, okay.

03:40.951 --> 03:43.085
Yeah, it was huge. And
you can't really pass them

03:43.121 --> 03:44.920
- because of the side things on its wing.
- Right. Mm-hmm.

03:44.956 --> 03:46.521
- You get sucked right into it.
- Right.

03:46.557 --> 03:47.622
That happened to Gary.

03:47.658 --> 03:49.057
- Do you remember Gary?
- Oh, my... Yes!

03:49.093 --> 03:50.626
No, I know. And I remember.

03:50.661 --> 03:52.293
And the feathers were flying
all over the place.

03:52.329 --> 03:53.329
And I said,

03:53.364 --> 03:55.131
"Well, Gary has just passed on."

03:55.165 --> 03:56.100
- That's right.
- You said, Do you

03:56.126 --> 03:57.098
remember what I said? I said,

03:57.134 --> 03:59.100
Both: "Gary has just passed on."

03:59.137 --> 04:00.635
- Guys, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I said that.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.170
You just... Can you just stop?

04:02.205 --> 04:04.006
Just stop talking?

04:04.040 --> 04:06.509
Do you know how many times
you've told this story?

04:06.544 --> 04:08.777
- It always feels like the first time.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.812 --> 04:11.546
Every day! In this exact spot.

04:11.581 --> 04:14.015
Aren't you sick of this?

04:14.050 --> 04:15.450
Should we move?

04:15.485 --> 04:17.452
- There's a trash can over there.
- Yeah, it's right there.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.355
- It's great.
- We've been to the trash can.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.007
I feel like there's a
whole world out there,

04:22.043 --> 04:23.391
and we've never seen it.

04:23.427 --> 04:25.995
Aren't you curious?

04:26.029 --> 04:27.220
We should head over to the trash can.

04:27.245 --> 04:28.096
Let's go to the trash can.

04:28.132 --> 04:29.132
I think we just go.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.899
Why don't you guys go to the trash can.

04:30.935 --> 04:32.268
I'm just gonna...

04:32.302 --> 04:34.687
I think I gotta go.

04:34.721 --> 04:37.173
Huh. Well, good on Shane, you know?

04:37.207 --> 04:40.108
So, anyway, he gets too
close to the wing,

04:40.144 --> 04:41.976
and he just got...
whoosh! sucked right in.

04:41.978 --> 04:44.196
Oh my God, it was so disturbing.

04:44.231 --> 04:46.447
âŞ âŞ

04:56.494 --> 04:57.659
What the...

04:57.711 --> 04:59.327
No way.

05:01.415 --> 05:02.997
Swans.

05:04.668 --> 05:06.552
Sorry about that. You understand.

05:06.586 --> 05:07.802
You can't just let anybody in.

05:07.838 --> 05:10.439
Totally fine. Water under the bridge.

05:10.473 --> 05:12.208
- I don't think we got your name?
- Alex.

05:12.242 --> 05:13.843
- Alex, oh cool.
- Yes, nice to meet you.

05:13.877 --> 05:14.877
- I'm Mike.
- Mike.

05:14.879 --> 05:16.238
- This is my brother, Phil.
- Phil.

05:16.264 --> 05:17.680
- Okay, Phil, what's up?
- What's going on?

05:17.731 --> 05:18.814
How you doing?

05:18.850 --> 05:20.014
- So cool.
- This is cool.

05:20.050 --> 05:21.175
So cool to have another guy in here.

05:21.201 --> 05:21.783
This is different.

05:21.819 --> 05:22.750
Phil: Um, so this is our home.

05:22.786 --> 05:24.286
Mi casa es su casa.

05:24.322 --> 05:26.055
Holy shit.

05:26.089 --> 05:27.723
- Yeah, it's um...
- Yeah, no, it's pretty nice.

05:27.757 --> 05:28.891
- This is our space.
- Home sweet home.

05:28.925 --> 05:31.326
We're actually thinking of
knocking down this divider wall

05:31.362 --> 05:32.661
- Mm-hmm.
- and making it one...

05:32.697 --> 05:35.197
Less with the
chatting, more with the touring.

05:35.233 --> 05:36.465
- Am I right?
- Yeah!

05:36.500 --> 05:37.966
- Let's give him a tour!
- Let's do it!

05:38.002 --> 05:39.500
- Let me check this place out.
- Okay, cool.

05:39.536 --> 05:42.204
What kind of expensive
shit do you have in this house?

05:42.255 --> 05:44.088
Phil: Yeah, so this
is my little scratch pad.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.257
This is where I come to get away.

05:46.293 --> 05:49.077
Um, just be, like, creative, and
really let the juices flow.

05:49.112 --> 05:50.778
Wait, what are you working on?

05:50.814 --> 05:52.213
Oh, it's nothing, really.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.348
It is something.

05:53.384 --> 05:55.683
Tell him. Tell Alex.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.019
Well, it's a little novel. Um, it's...

05:58.055 --> 05:59.254
- You're writing a book?
- Yeah.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.723
That's always been a dream of mine.

06:00.757 --> 06:02.992
Oh my God, it's so
nice to see another writer!

06:03.026 --> 06:04.392
Insane, right?

06:04.427 --> 06:06.362
Yeah, it's a novel about
my brother, Mike.

06:06.396 --> 06:07.396
- So, it's...
- Amazing.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.930
Yeah, he commissioned
me to write it. I did.

06:08.966 --> 06:11.766
So, it's a mixture of Mike
history, Mike anecdotes,

06:11.802 --> 06:13.535
and just general Mike-isms.

06:13.571 --> 06:14.970
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I think it's...

06:15.005 --> 06:17.406
it's such an honor to
be with you every day,

06:17.440 --> 06:19.173
- and I love you so much.
- Oh, thank you, so much.

06:19.209 --> 06:20.375
I love you so much.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.211
- You are everything to me.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

06:22.245 --> 06:24.579
You guys have an intense relationship.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.649
- I don't know about "intense."
- I don't think it's that...

06:26.684 --> 06:29.350
Well, I mean, intimate, brotherly...

06:29.387 --> 06:30.685
- Brotherly is the word.
- intimacy.

06:30.721 --> 06:31.920
A brotherly intimacy.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.322
- You wanna go see the mirror?
- Yes!

06:33.356 --> 06:34.329
Let's see the mirror. You gotta

06:34.353 --> 06:35.456
- see Mike's mirror.
- It's gorgeous!

06:35.492 --> 06:36.992
I'm into mirrors.

06:38.396 --> 06:39.728
Cool, so this is my mirror.

06:39.764 --> 06:43.399
Um, I guess, just, really where
I go to, well, look at myself.

06:43.433 --> 06:45.100
- Nice.
- Me, too.

06:45.151 --> 06:46.935
- But it's really...
- But I go to look at yourself.

06:46.987 --> 06:48.237
Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, babe.

06:48.271 --> 06:51.639
Uh, no, it's also... It's
also where I go to work on myself.

06:51.675 --> 06:53.776
- I take my comb...
- Yeah, Alex,

06:53.778 --> 06:55.127
- And I just start to...
- Alex, come here.

06:55.151 --> 06:55.576
Watch this.

06:55.612 --> 06:57.446
Watch this. Watch his technique.

06:57.497 --> 06:59.514
- I just... ever so...
- Uh-huh...

06:59.550 --> 07:00.848
And it's just... Alex,
you watching this?

07:00.884 --> 07:02.817
Watch his downstrokes. Oh, my goodness.

07:02.853 --> 07:04.319
You know, a thousand combs a day.

07:04.355 --> 07:05.721
Not a comb shy, Alex.

07:05.755 --> 07:07.055
- 1,000.
- What...

07:07.091 --> 07:09.490
How else do you think I get
this perfect coat? And it is perfect.

07:09.526 --> 07:11.627
And it is perfect,
Alex. (nervous laughter)

07:11.661 --> 07:14.663
It's great. Almost as good as mine.

07:14.699 --> 07:15.997
I don't...

07:16.033 --> 07:18.100
- What is your regimen for this?
- You know, I do want to ask you,

07:18.134 --> 07:20.435
- is how do you...?
- Au naturel, yeah. Au naturel.

07:20.471 --> 07:24.023
I have a bunch of
dreadlocked fur around my asshole.

07:24.057 --> 07:26.240
My asshole looks like Rob Zombie.

07:26.276 --> 07:28.310
âŞ I am the Astro-Creep âŞ

07:28.312 --> 07:30.112
(imitating guitar riff) Yeah!

07:30.146 --> 07:31.680
Okay, we've got more of
the apartment to see.

07:31.716 --> 07:32.981
- Why don't we go ahead and...
- Okay, cool.

07:33.033 --> 07:34.316
I'd love to see more.

07:34.367 --> 07:36.451
And I think Mom said she was
gonna place a runner in this hallway

07:36.487 --> 07:38.286
- because it's getting a little...
- Oh, it was right here.

07:38.322 --> 07:40.723
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What is that over there?

07:40.757 --> 07:42.457
Um...

07:42.492 --> 07:43.992
I'm sorry, my... (muttering)

07:44.028 --> 07:45.961
Why is he having a
Vietnam flashback over there?

07:45.997 --> 07:47.696
- Fuck...
- Well...

07:47.731 --> 07:50.699
uh, he gets very sensitive
when the shot box is brought up...

07:50.735 --> 07:52.004
- Uh-huh.
- I don't wanna

07:52.029 --> 07:53.334
go in the shot box!

07:53.370 --> 07:55.336
- You're not going in the...
- Don't put me in the shot box, man!

07:55.372 --> 07:57.338
No one's putting you in
the shot box, Phil, okay?

07:57.375 --> 07:59.841
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

07:59.877 --> 08:02.577
It's just whenever someone brings
up the shot box, I get all freaked out.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.480
What happens in the shot box?

08:04.514 --> 08:06.915
We get locked in it, and
then they bring us somewhere,

08:06.951 --> 08:10.351
and then some
motherfucker sticks us with shots.

08:10.387 --> 08:12.021
The shot box is not a good place.

08:12.055 --> 08:13.689
You don't wanna go in
the shot box, Alex.

08:13.723 --> 08:15.089
You don't wanna be
in the shot box, Alex.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.391
That's all I'll say.

08:16.427 --> 08:17.893
Yeah...

08:17.927 --> 08:19.762
So, about that litter box?

08:19.797 --> 08:22.031
Uh, I could really use a shit.

08:22.065 --> 08:23.531
- Oh, cool.
- It's just down the hall here,

08:23.567 --> 08:25.701
- and then to the left.
- Perfect.

08:25.752 --> 08:27.086
Oh, I hope he has a good shit.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.771
- I hope he passes well.
- I hope he does.

08:28.805 --> 08:31.089
âŞ âŞ

08:31.125 --> 08:32.924
Come on, come on. What
do we got? What do we got?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.876
Where is it?

08:34.912 --> 08:37.010
Come on, come on.

08:37.048 --> 08:38.212
Bingo!

08:38.249 --> 08:39.748
Jackpot.

08:43.586 --> 08:44.720
Just put it...

08:44.754 --> 08:46.721
We cannot put the snack within
the food, 'cause then he...

08:46.756 --> 08:48.023
- He's coming.
- Oh, all right.

08:48.058 --> 08:49.424
I'm gonna get going.

08:49.460 --> 08:50.625
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.095
Yeah, I just used the litter
box. Thank you so much, guys.

08:53.129 --> 08:54.328
- Nice meeting you.
- No, you gotta stay.

08:54.365 --> 08:55.804
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You gotta stay.

08:55.832 --> 08:58.200
I mean, I got a bunch of stuff
to do. I really should hit the road.

08:58.235 --> 08:59.701
Alex, we know you're super busy,

08:59.736 --> 09:01.736
and we just thought we'd
lay out all this stuff.

09:01.772 --> 09:04.773
Look, we have, um, four different
types of dry food,

09:04.808 --> 09:07.676
and we have eight types of
cat toys that we can all play with

09:07.711 --> 09:09.378
and share together. And we figured,

09:09.413 --> 09:11.712
I don't know, as our new best friend,

09:11.749 --> 09:13.649
we should feast together a little bit.

09:13.683 --> 09:17.019
Wow. I mean... thank you.

09:17.053 --> 09:18.653
I don't know what to say.

09:18.688 --> 09:20.889
Don't say anything. Eat.

09:21.523 --> 09:22.924
(gobbling)

09:22.976 --> 09:24.058
- Whoa.
- Okay.

09:24.095 --> 09:25.427
Wow.

09:25.428 --> 09:26.511
Alex, you're...

09:26.563 --> 09:28.297
When's the last
time you've eaten, buddy?

09:28.331 --> 09:29.730
(gobbling)

09:29.767 --> 09:30.932
Okay, gross.

09:30.934 --> 09:32.150
He's eating the toys, too.

09:32.186 --> 09:33.798
I think he's eating
the toys at this point.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.336
He's just...

09:34.370 --> 09:35.471
He's so... Okay.

09:35.505 --> 09:37.538
- (gagging)
- Whoa, he's just...

09:37.575 --> 09:39.374
- Easy. Breathe, breathe.
- Wow.

09:39.409 --> 09:41.677
- Breathe.
- Shh. Shh.

09:41.711 --> 09:42.911
That was nuts.

09:42.947 --> 09:44.312
That was fucking nuts.

09:44.347 --> 09:46.581
- (panting)
- That was pretty fucked up and wild.

09:46.616 --> 09:48.049
That was sick.

09:48.085 --> 09:49.784
- That was sick.
- That was cool.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.120
That was really cool.

09:51.154 --> 09:53.489
Hey, Alex, by the way, have
you ever, um, tried catnip before?

09:53.524 --> 09:57.158
'Cause we recently got this new
strain, and it is primo stuff.

09:57.193 --> 09:58.494
Oh, you gotta try it, Alex.

09:58.528 --> 10:01.163
No, I've never even... What
is that? Is that like...

10:01.197 --> 10:04.633
It's just a super chill thing
that Mike and I use to sort of relax

10:04.668 --> 10:05.634
and really just kind of... just

10:05.659 --> 10:06.601
- take the edge off.
- Hang out,

10:06.636 --> 10:07.471
and take the edge off, you

10:07.495 --> 10:08.394
- know what I mean?
- Mm-hmm.

10:08.438 --> 10:09.337
Well, I like the sound of that.

10:09.373 --> 10:10.605
Let me light you, dude.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.073
- Take that in.
- (burbling)

10:12.109 --> 10:15.910
Watch how he's just sucking it
up. He's not being a pussy about it.

10:15.946 --> 10:17.278
Hold it in, bitch.

10:17.313 --> 10:18.313
(coughing)

10:18.349 --> 10:20.315
Yeah, he coughs a lot.

10:20.350 --> 10:21.549
I'm cool.

10:21.585 --> 10:22.750
You take a hit, man.

10:22.786 --> 10:24.352
- Uh, me? I...
- Here, Mike.

10:24.388 --> 10:25.695
Here take the bong, Mike.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.054
- Light him up.
- Uh, sure.

10:27.091 --> 10:28.590
- Breathe in deep.
- Okay.

10:28.625 --> 10:29.865
- Like this?
- Nice, yeah, dude.

10:29.894 --> 10:31.960
Hold it in. hold it in.

10:31.995 --> 10:33.662
Oh... fuck...

10:33.713 --> 10:34.879
(laughing)

10:34.914 --> 10:36.331
- Whoa!
- He's so high!

10:36.366 --> 10:38.332
Alex is fucked up!

10:38.369 --> 10:40.001
Oh, fuck...

10:40.004 --> 10:41.419
He's feeling it now.

10:41.471 --> 10:43.004
- You're feeling it.
- Haha!

10:43.057 --> 10:47.826
(laughing)

10:49.179 --> 10:51.013
(groaning)

10:51.014 --> 10:55.017
âŞ âŞ

10:58.288 --> 11:01.907
(applause)

11:18.232 --> 11:19.591
Excuse me?

11:19.626 --> 11:21.592
- Huh?
- Are you okay?

11:21.629 --> 11:22.793
Hi... Yeah.

11:22.846 --> 11:24.929
Oh, you just seemed
kind of... a little lost,

11:24.965 --> 11:27.099
so I just wanted to come
over and introduce myself.

11:27.134 --> 11:28.134
I'm Olivia.

11:28.134 --> 11:29.717
Hi. I'm... Sorry, I'm Shane.

11:29.769 --> 11:31.019
I'm new here. I...

11:31.054 --> 11:32.054
Can I ask you a question?

11:32.056 --> 11:33.221
Sure.

11:33.224 --> 11:35.606
And forgive me if it's too personal,

11:35.643 --> 11:37.725
but are you... a black swan?

11:38.895 --> 11:41.363
Am I a black swan?

11:41.398 --> 11:42.398
That was the question.

11:42.399 --> 11:43.532
Right.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.234
Um...

11:45.286 --> 11:47.235
- Yeah. Yeah.
- (gasps) I knew it!

11:47.238 --> 11:49.120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
- I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

11:49.155 --> 11:50.404
That's why I came over.

11:50.407 --> 11:51.532
'Cause I got so
excited 'cause I saw you,

11:51.557 --> 11:51.907
Oh.

11:51.908 --> 11:53.741
And I 've never seen
anybody like you over here before,

11:53.744 --> 11:55.244
and you just stood
out. You seem different.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.411
Oh, thank you.

11:56.413 --> 11:58.379
Yeah, I'm a black swan.

11:58.414 --> 11:59.413
I'll show you around, okay?

11:59.466 --> 12:00.631
- Okay.
- Just follow me.

12:00.668 --> 12:01.799
Okay, great.

12:01.835 --> 12:03.418
Wow.

12:03.470 --> 12:05.586
This place is pretty incredible.

12:05.639 --> 12:08.005
This is Central Park!

12:08.057 --> 12:10.892
It's a place where anything
could happen, dreams come true...

12:10.927 --> 12:12.510
Ooh, I see my friend, H&M.

12:12.562 --> 12:14.312
H&M!

12:15.682 --> 12:17.932
Oh, H&M, this is Shane. Shane, H&M.

12:17.985 --> 12:19.268
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry,

12:19.269 --> 12:20.735
- Your name is Shane?
- Yeah.

12:20.770 --> 12:22.653
Yeah, they should take away the "ane,"

12:22.690 --> 12:25.106
just call you "Sh" 'cause I
don't want to hear you talk.

12:25.109 --> 12:26.274
(chuckles)

12:26.277 --> 12:27.993
Shane's from, uh...
Wait, where are you from again?

12:28.028 --> 12:29.945
Oh, just like, over...

12:29.996 --> 12:31.746
- the... freeway.
- Oh, yeah, the freeway.

12:31.782 --> 12:34.499
The freeway? What do
we got here, a goose?

12:34.534 --> 12:36.284
(laughing)

12:36.287 --> 12:37.952
Oh, God, no.

12:38.004 --> 12:39.754
This guy is a swan, right?

12:39.789 --> 12:41.289
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm just saying,

12:41.292 --> 12:43.091
Shane, you don't seem like
the other swans I know.

12:43.126 --> 12:45.259
Well, I'm... I'm black.

12:45.296 --> 12:46.628
- Oh, you're a black swan.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:46.679 --> 12:48.547
All right. So, you know the
swan song, you know all the...

12:48.599 --> 12:49.639
Totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:49.682 --> 12:51.549
Hey, uh, Shane, I wanted to ask you,

12:51.601 --> 12:52.683
what is the swan song?

12:52.720 --> 12:54.519
- Come on.
- What? Olivia?

12:54.554 --> 12:56.520
If he's a swan, he knows the swan song.

12:56.557 --> 12:57.773
Of course.

12:59.143 --> 13:00.274
Okay, so...

13:00.311 --> 13:01.976
Shane, you didn't tell
me what the swan song was.

13:01.979 --> 13:03.729
Oh, I didn't tell
you. You were asking me?

13:03.780 --> 13:05.813
- Yeah.
- I... Don't you know?

13:05.865 --> 13:06.981
No, I know what it is.

13:06.984 --> 13:08.317
Prove it. Prove
that you know what it is.

13:08.369 --> 13:09.368
"Country Grammar" by Nelly.

13:09.403 --> 13:11.370
Right, exactly, it's "Country
Grammar" by Nelly.

13:13.072 --> 13:14.538
All right. So, you're a swan.

13:14.575 --> 13:16.741
Whew. I hate geese, man.

13:16.793 --> 13:17.826
Yeah, me too.

13:17.827 --> 13:19.293
I'm not even sure geese are real.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.961
The honking though? The sound they make?

13:20.998 --> 13:22.557
- Why would anybody honk?
- It's like...

13:22.582 --> 13:24.216
- Yeah.
- That's not the sound a swan makes.

13:24.250 --> 13:25.250
Totally, totally.

13:25.302 --> 13:27.552
- Oh, Shane, my dog.
- Yeah?

13:27.587 --> 13:30.672
I wanted to mention, now
that you're down with the crew,

13:30.673 --> 13:31.764
- Cool.
- I'm actually gonna

13:31.788 --> 13:32.807
be deejaying tonight

13:32.842 --> 13:34.142
- at Club Men.
- Oh, yeah!

13:34.177 --> 13:35.344
You gotta come!

13:35.346 --> 13:37.346
- Right here, baby.
- Your golden ticket. Check it out.

13:37.398 --> 13:38.679
That sounds super fun.

13:38.682 --> 13:40.649
H&M: So, see you there?

13:40.683 --> 13:43.684
âŞ âŞ

13:44.772 --> 13:45.854
Mike: Oh, no, click that one.

13:45.905 --> 13:47.188
- You ever see this one?
- Oh, this one.

13:47.191 --> 13:48.191
No, no, no, hit that one.

13:48.241 --> 13:49.740
- (laughing)
- (groaning)

13:49.777 --> 13:52.693
- No, hold up, watch this...
- This is my favorite part.

13:52.745 --> 13:54.328
What the fuck was in that?

13:54.365 --> 13:56.697
(laughing)

13:56.700 --> 13:59.418
- Oh, right?
- Oh, fuck...

13:59.503 --> 14:02.870
Aah!

14:02.873 --> 14:04.789
I... I'm a kitten again.

14:04.841 --> 14:08.376
And there's all my brothers and sisters.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.346
But not me.

14:12.383 --> 14:13.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

14:13.966 --> 14:15.100
He's coming for me now.

14:15.134 --> 14:16.217
What? Get off me!

14:16.253 --> 14:17.769
Aah!

14:17.804 --> 14:19.553
He tossed me into an alley.

14:19.556 --> 14:20.556
Alone.

14:20.557 --> 14:21.557
(thunder rumbles)

14:21.607 --> 14:23.191
Scared.

14:23.226 --> 14:25.192
He made me an alley cat.

14:25.229 --> 14:26.927
(whimpering)

14:26.963 --> 14:28.363
Alex, Alex, Alex!

14:28.399 --> 14:29.530
- Alex, wake up!
- You all right, man?

14:29.566 --> 14:31.283
- (sighs) Oh, my God.
- Are you okay?

14:31.317 --> 14:32.768
Yeah, I just, I...

14:32.802 --> 14:35.370
I had this crazy flashback.

14:35.405 --> 14:36.738
- Really?
- Whoa.

14:36.774 --> 14:38.139
- Yeah, it's awful.
- Well, you're safe now.

14:38.174 --> 14:39.341
You're here with us, man.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.676
- Everything's cool.
- We care for you, you know?

14:41.711 --> 14:43.945
(sighs) Oh, fuck.

14:43.980 --> 14:45.514
Um... (clears throat)

14:45.548 --> 14:47.315
I lied to you guys.

14:47.350 --> 14:51.452
I'm an alley cat. I came in here
to... I came here to rob you guys.

14:51.488 --> 14:53.087
It's really lame.

14:53.123 --> 14:56.258
I'm so embarrassed. Here you
go. Here's all your stuff back.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.591
I'm so...

14:59.196 --> 15:01.129
Are you done?

15:01.164 --> 15:03.398
- Are you done with your little speech?
- Are you done with your speech?

15:03.433 --> 15:06.100
(snickering)

15:06.135 --> 15:08.669
Uh, why is that funny?

15:08.705 --> 15:10.272
- Look at his face!
- Look at his face.

15:10.307 --> 15:12.407
Oh my God, he's so honest now.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.808
- He's honest now.
- He's Honest Alex now.

15:13.844 --> 15:15.309
Alex, Alex,

15:15.345 --> 15:16.845
you think we didn't know
that the whole time?

15:16.879 --> 15:18.746
- Alex: What do you mean...
- Alex, you think we're dumb-dumbs?

15:18.782 --> 15:19.980
You think we're fucking idiots, man?

15:20.017 --> 15:21.582
- (laughing)
- Okay, guys,

15:21.618 --> 15:22.918
I'm gonna go. It's time for me to leave.

15:22.943 --> 15:23.585
No, no, no, no, no!

15:23.620 --> 15:24.786
Alex, Alex, Alex.

15:24.822 --> 15:25.942
Alex, you don't get it, man.

15:25.956 --> 15:27.556
You're ours now, dude.

15:27.591 --> 15:29.557
(laughing)

15:29.592 --> 15:32.259
What... Uh, what do you guys
mean? What are you talking about?

15:32.296 --> 15:33.562
Yeah, we own you, Alex,

15:33.596 --> 15:35.697
and frankly, we're just
gonna fuck you up, dude.

15:35.731 --> 15:36.731
(laughing maniacally)

15:36.767 --> 15:37.767
Oh, look at that!

15:37.801 --> 15:39.683
- Mikey's got a little knifey!
- Oh, fuck!

15:39.720 --> 15:41.769
- Help me!
- Mikey's got a little knifey!

15:41.804 --> 15:42.854
Help, somebody help!

15:42.889 --> 15:44.722
- (laughing continues)
- Somebody help!

15:44.774 --> 15:46.106
Help me!

15:54.485 --> 15:57.568
(electronic music playing)

15:57.620 --> 16:00.238
I can't hear you, Club
Men, make some noise!

16:00.289 --> 16:03.542
- (cheering)
- DJ H&M coming at you hot, right now!

16:03.576 --> 16:05.409
Who's ready for some Nelly?!

16:05.461 --> 16:06.711
- Finally, some Nelly!
- Okay, no,

16:06.746 --> 16:08.163
I left it at home. Um...

16:08.164 --> 16:10.499
Here's something that
sounds similar to Nelly.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.001
You know, library music from
some sort of... Just as good.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.004
(hip-hop beat plays)

16:15.054 --> 16:16.587
(laughing)

16:16.639 --> 16:17.889
You're so easy to talk to.

16:17.924 --> 16:19.640
You, too! I was just gonna say,

16:19.676 --> 16:21.142
you are so easy to talk to.

16:21.177 --> 16:22.394
- That's so funny that you were...
- Thanks.

16:22.428 --> 16:23.845
- I'd like to make a toast.
- Yes.

16:23.897 --> 16:26.181
Um, I'm really happy that I met you,

16:26.232 --> 16:27.765
and you seem really nice.

16:27.817 --> 16:28.850
To Shane and Olivia!

16:28.902 --> 16:30.235
To Shane and Olivia.

16:30.269 --> 16:31.686
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

16:31.738 --> 16:33.738
Crowd: Whoo!

16:33.774 --> 16:35.356
This is it, okay!

16:35.359 --> 16:37.274
Okay, see my hips?

16:37.326 --> 16:38.777
Whoa, he's got the sticks!

16:38.828 --> 16:41.363
You have really beautiful eyes.

16:41.414 --> 16:43.498
I was just gonna say the same thing.

16:43.533 --> 16:46.868
Well, I have to admit something to you.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.919
Anything.

16:48.956 --> 16:51.706
I've never been with a black guy before.

16:51.707 --> 16:53.674
(moaning)

16:53.710 --> 16:55.009
Oh, my God.

16:55.044 --> 16:56.677
- Let me just lift up my feathers.
- Oh, my God.

16:56.712 --> 16:57.712
Here we go.

16:57.713 --> 17:01.265
(Olivia and Shane groaning)

17:01.301 --> 17:05.103
(groaning intensifies)

17:05.137 --> 17:06.185
(music stops)

17:06.222 --> 17:11.491
(Shane honking rhythmically)

17:13.230 --> 17:16.280
(honking loudly)

17:16.316 --> 17:17.449
Wait, what was that?!

17:17.483 --> 17:19.233
- What?
- Dude, you just honked!

17:19.286 --> 17:20.652
H&M, what are you doing in here?!

17:20.703 --> 17:21.903
He's a goose, I told you!

17:21.954 --> 17:23.238
That's a goose's honk!

17:23.289 --> 17:24.704
What are you talking about?

17:24.740 --> 17:25.789
Shane's not a goose.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.741
Right, Shane?

17:27.742 --> 17:29.294
Olivia, I'm sorry.

17:29.328 --> 17:30.744
- (crowd gasps)
- Oh, God!

17:30.747 --> 17:33.498
I'm still the same bird.

17:33.549 --> 17:35.000
Just get out of here.

17:35.051 --> 17:37.919
Get out of my club.

17:37.971 --> 17:38.971
Goose!

17:39.006 --> 17:41.088
Get out of here, honky!

17:41.124 --> 17:42.284
Are you kidding me, a goose?!

17:42.291 --> 17:44.159
I'm 'bout to lose my shit on this goose!

17:44.193 --> 17:45.233
Back up, back up, back up!

17:45.261 --> 17:47.328
Get your fucking wings off me, bro!

17:50.601 --> 17:51.932
(sighs)

17:53.319 --> 17:55.769
(snoring)

18:05.615 --> 18:06.948
Olivia: Hey, Shane.

18:12.122 --> 18:14.355
(sighs) Hi, Olivia.

18:14.391 --> 18:16.191
So, was everything between us a lie?

18:16.226 --> 18:19.426
No. I've never met anyone like you.

18:19.462 --> 18:21.829
Well, I've never met anyone like you.

18:21.865 --> 18:24.098
But I just can't stay here.

18:24.134 --> 18:25.432
Where are you going?

18:25.469 --> 18:28.636
Well, I'm not sure.

18:28.672 --> 18:33.074
But what I do know is that
this place just... It's not for me.

18:33.109 --> 18:35.609
I'm just a simple goose.

18:35.645 --> 18:38.413
If you ever change your
mind, you know where I'll be.

18:38.448 --> 18:41.482
In or around the men's
public restroom in Central Park.

18:41.518 --> 18:44.118
It was nice meeting you, Olivia.

18:44.153 --> 18:45.286
All right.

18:45.322 --> 18:46.488
All right.

18:49.192 --> 18:53.432
âŞ âŞ

18:55.499 --> 18:57.414
So, anyway, we were right
over Calgary, right?

18:57.467 --> 18:58.666
- Right. Right. Yup.
- You remember that?

18:58.669 --> 19:00.234
And we were
flying... I'm in third position.

19:00.269 --> 19:01.670
Oh, you remember Gary, right?

19:01.704 --> 19:03.570
Gary, he could never stay in the V.

19:03.606 --> 19:04.673
As hard as he tried.

19:04.708 --> 19:05.667
Then that big bird came,

19:05.692 --> 19:06.732
- that big Boeing.
- Right.

19:06.742 --> 19:07.776
Lo and behold...

19:07.810 --> 19:09.844
Shane: Gary gets
sucked right into that engine,

19:09.846 --> 19:11.895
And poof! Just a cloud of feathers.

19:11.932 --> 19:13.314
Gary is gone!

19:13.349 --> 19:14.430
- (laughing)
- Shane's back!

19:14.433 --> 19:15.650
- Oh, Shane!
- What's up, guys?

19:15.685 --> 19:17.352
Exactly, yeah!

19:17.403 --> 19:20.689
No, I mean, I saw bits and pieces
of Gary flying all over the place.

19:20.740 --> 19:21.799
It's like, "There's some Gary.

19:21.825 --> 19:22.824
- There's some Gary.
- Uh-huh.

19:22.858 --> 19:24.409
"Hey, my best friend, Gary!"

19:24.443 --> 19:25.492
- (laughing)
- Yeah.

19:25.528 --> 19:30.030
âŞ âŞ

19:31.785 --> 19:34.335
All right, guys, not funny anymore.

19:34.371 --> 19:35.670
You can let me out now.

19:35.705 --> 19:36.705
Guys!

19:36.740 --> 19:37.939
Okay, so, Alex, hey, uh...

19:37.973 --> 19:39.140
- Should I come out now?
- Yeah, go, go.

19:39.175 --> 19:40.174
- Okay, okay.
- Go. Show him.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.109
Uh, hey, Alex, what's up? It's Mike.

19:42.144 --> 19:43.211
- Ooh. Wow.
- Um...

19:43.246 --> 19:44.878
- Rev your tool. Rev your tool.
- Okay, right, right.

19:44.914 --> 19:46.815
Oh... Like a dentist?

19:46.849 --> 19:47.949
I don't even know.

19:47.983 --> 19:49.616
- Tell me when to come out.
- Okay, okay, hold on.

19:49.653 --> 19:51.286
So, presenting, Phil...

19:51.320 --> 19:53.054
Bah-buh, baah!

19:53.089 --> 19:55.457
(laughing) I don't know, I
just ordered it off the Internet.

19:55.491 --> 19:56.758
I don't know, it's spooky enough.

19:56.792 --> 19:57.858
No, it's good. It's good.

19:57.894 --> 19:59.359
I don't really know what
it means or anything.

19:59.395 --> 20:00.694
Alex, what are you thinking about these?

20:00.730 --> 20:01.730
- Who's scarier?
- Are these, um...

20:01.765 --> 20:02.763
Fuck the both of you, man!

20:02.798 --> 20:04.132
I'm gonna straight up murder you!

20:04.166 --> 20:06.401
I'm gonna cut you open and
I'm gonna rape you, buddy!

20:06.435 --> 20:07.801
- What? Phil, okay, let's hold on.
- I'm sorry.

20:07.837 --> 20:09.436
- I didn't mean that.
- I didn't mean the rape thing.

20:09.472 --> 20:10.739
Help!

20:10.773 --> 20:12.073
- No.
- That's not gonna do anything.

20:12.108 --> 20:13.708
- Help!
- That's okay.

20:13.743 --> 20:16.111
Phil, you know what, your back thing,
the buckle, I just need to fix it.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.711
- Thank you so much.
- Just turn around for a second.

20:17.748 --> 20:19.614
- Thank you, honey, thank you.
- Fuck. Okay, Alex.

20:19.648 --> 20:21.915
Think. Think, think, think, think...

20:21.917 --> 20:23.417
Wait a minute.

20:26.256 --> 20:28.355
Holy shit, it's the same lock.

20:28.391 --> 20:29.391
All right, Alex.

20:29.425 --> 20:31.859
Get ready to open up,
in more ways than one.

20:31.894 --> 20:32.894
(laughing)

20:32.929 --> 20:34.496
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!

20:34.530 --> 20:35.997
Before you guys kill me,

20:36.031 --> 20:37.298
Phil, would you, uh...

20:37.334 --> 20:38.334
Hmm?

20:38.367 --> 20:39.834
Would you mind reading from your novel?

20:39.869 --> 20:41.502
From my novel? No, I couldn't.

20:41.538 --> 20:42.737
- It's still in a first draft.
- Wait, Phil,

20:42.772 --> 20:43.971
this is perfect, actually.

20:44.007 --> 20:45.405
- What? Why?
- Well, now you have an audience.

20:45.442 --> 20:46.673
I think Alex really wants to hear it.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.509
It's just like a last rites thing.

20:48.545 --> 20:49.844
It'd be a nice way for me to go.

20:50.881 --> 20:51.945
Okay. All right, I'm gonna do it.

20:51.981 --> 20:53.047
- Okay, cool.
- Okay, okay.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.150
Okay, this is the middle of chapter 18.

20:55.184 --> 20:57.085
- Oh, I love 18.
- Okay, great.

20:57.119 --> 20:58.853
Okay, everyone shut up. Hehe.

20:58.888 --> 21:01.088
"It was a dark and
stormy night last fall.

21:01.124 --> 21:02.723
Phil was always afraid of thunder.

21:02.759 --> 21:04.592
It reminded him of a vacuum."

21:04.627 --> 21:05.993
Easy, easy...

21:06.028 --> 21:08.529
"As he cowered in fear like a
stupid little baby under the couch,"

21:08.565 --> 21:09.730
Yes!

21:09.766 --> 21:11.965
"he thought that maybe
things Peace out, motherfuckers.

21:12.001 --> 21:13.835
Weren't gonna be that good after
that. Until he saw a paw."

21:13.869 --> 21:14.869
Oh, man.

21:14.904 --> 21:16.837
"He saw Mike."

21:16.873 --> 21:18.006
- Okay, that's it.
- Dude!

21:18.040 --> 21:19.773
That's all I'm gonna
read for now. Was that good?

21:19.809 --> 21:20.875
Yes, dude, are you kidding me?

21:20.911 --> 21:22.777
Well, you inspired me to do it!

21:22.813 --> 21:25.028
Honestly, I bet there's not
a dry eye in the house.

21:25.065 --> 21:26.548
Uh... You know what, he's gone.

21:26.583 --> 21:27.949
'Cause we were looking at each other.

21:27.983 --> 21:29.490
We were making pretty intense eye

21:29.516 --> 21:31.219
- contact throughout that.
- I can't not.

21:31.253 --> 21:32.253
Fuck.

21:32.288 --> 21:33.288
Should we...

21:33.323 --> 21:34.955
- chase after him?
- I don't know.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.324
What time is it?

21:36.358 --> 21:37.558
It's 3:30.

21:38.929 --> 21:40.494
(yawns)

21:40.497 --> 21:46.334
(snoring)

21:46.336 --> 21:47.551
I love you, Phil.

21:47.586 --> 21:49.002
I love you, Mike.

21:49.055 --> 21:50.587
I love you so much, Mike.

21:53.894 --> 21:56.176
(applause)

22:08.023 --> 22:11.192
(excited chattering)

22:11.243 --> 22:13.361
I loved it. It was
great. Chapter seven...

22:17.000 --> 22:18.700
How many of these do we have?

22:18.751 --> 22:19.951
I'm getting kind of tired.

22:20.002 --> 22:22.369
Parched too. If I could
get a water, that'd be great.

22:22.372 --> 22:24.172
All right, what's your name, brother?

22:24.207 --> 22:25.339
Hi, my name is Max.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.375
Hey, Max.

22:26.375 --> 22:28.343
(stuttering) I...
I... I run "Alex Questions,"

22:28.377 --> 22:30.612
the Tumblr blog that q... that questions...
uh, questioning your book.

22:30.646 --> 22:32.279
Oh, you write that?

22:32.315 --> 22:35.016
There's just a lot of holes
and... and questions that a lot of us have.

22:35.050 --> 22:36.538
You're saying that you were assaulted,

22:36.563 --> 22:38.252
but you don't show
any of the typical signs

22:38.288 --> 22:39.688
of... post-traumatic s... stress...

22:39.689 --> 22:41.756
Did you fabricate... D...
Did you fabricate the... the book?

22:41.790 --> 22:43.991
No. And I went through a lot of therapy

22:44.027 --> 22:46.027
to help me with my PTSD,

22:46.061 --> 22:47.996
thank you, and I'm a strong person.

22:48.030 --> 22:49.963
Unlike some people that write a blog.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.098
You ever written a book?

22:51.134 --> 22:52.767
I wrote a children's book when I was 22.

22:52.801 --> 22:53.835
What's it called?

22:53.869 --> 22:55.036
"The Third Best Tree."

22:55.070 --> 22:56.570
"The Third Best Tree"?

22:56.573 --> 22:59.958
Hey, everybody, the author of
"The Third Best Tree" is here.

22:59.992 --> 23:01.742
"The Third Best Tree" is a
fiction book, sir, and y...

23:01.778 --> 23:03.044
you're claiming this is a memoir, sir.

23:03.078 --> 23:04.746
It is a memoir, a good one.

23:04.780 --> 23:06.114
A lot of people suspect that you fff...

23:06.148 --> 23:08.548
fabricated sss... some
portions of the story wholesale.
