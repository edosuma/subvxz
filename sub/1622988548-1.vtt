WEBVTT

00:06.381 --> 00:07.508
Claire, if you could say
one thing

00:07.549 --> 00:08.842
to all the viewers at home
watching...

00:08.884 --> 00:10.511
what would you want
to say to them?

00:24.483 --> 00:26.276
Construction.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.279
We can't hear you, I mean,
we can't hear it. Don't worry.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.412
Even if we can hear it,
doesn't matter.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.796
Do you believe in Astrology?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.685
Yeah, dude. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.353
Don't worry, don't overthink it.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.604
Just be natural.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.397
Just be natural, okay?

01:34.136 --> 01:35.971
You want me to stop recording?

03:15.988 --> 03:19.116
Um, does your family...
so, does he support you a lot?

03:24.288 --> 03:26.832
So your dad only supports you
financially?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.750
And you don't consider that
to be support?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.524
But you don't want to try?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.564
You know, it's funny,
'cause Tony Robbins

04:32.606 --> 04:35.817
isn't really seen as
a spiritual teacher.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.371
I think you have to lock up.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.516
It's pretty cool you have
your own elevator.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.324
Are you excited that you're
making your documentary?

06:50.035 --> 06:51.912
I think it will.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.246
You're 75% from North America?

11:07.292 --> 11:08.794
I'm so confused.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.380
So there's Southeast Asians,
there's Indians...

11:11.421 --> 11:14.508
And then this is the culture
of North America?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.889
I really think
I'm missing something.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.520
You're not a Buddhist, are you?

11:43.662 --> 11:47.499
So you're 72% Native American
is what you're saying?

11:47.541 --> 11:49.251
Okay, cool.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.918
I think he's just sitting there.

13:58.922 --> 14:01.300
Okay.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.427
I'm gonna get across the street,
okay?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.692
Claire?

16:23.734 --> 16:25.903
Come here, sorry.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.446
Um...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.072
No, no, uh...

16:29.114 --> 16:30.908
Zen Buddhism isn't really
Chinese, like...

16:30.949 --> 16:32.910
You said that you were looking
for a Chinese Buddhist Temple.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.579
But, like,
if you're looking for...

16:35.621 --> 16:36.997
Like, Zen is Japanese.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.791
I mean, I'm just
supposed to observe.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.711
But I didn't want you to
be embarrassed again.

16:42.753 --> 16:44.755
I don't get embarrassed.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.010
So let's say
you attain enlightenment.

18:14.887 --> 18:17.764
You're very close to it?

18:17.806 --> 18:20.017
Okay, so, you...

18:20.058 --> 18:22.561
Can you feel --

18:22.603 --> 18:25.272
You're close to it?

18:25.314 --> 18:27.524
The enlightenment?

18:31.695 --> 18:34.865
What does it look like?

21:50.018 --> 21:52.604
I think you still have
my mic pack.

21:55.232 --> 21:58.902
No, yeah,
but we need the mic pack.

21:58.944 --> 22:01.738
Yeah.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.491
Not when we're asleep,
I have to charge the battery.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.598
Does that work?

29:37.236 --> 29:39.154
I'm just gonna come down.

29:42.074 --> 29:43.784
No, I got this.

30:18.986 --> 30:20.904
I don't know if I really see it
that well.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.426
Claire?

31:24.468 --> 31:28.138
So, source, right? Does she mean
where it comes from?

31:32.351 --> 31:34.436
So you see that waterfall
over there?

31:34.478 --> 31:37.856
That's probably...
where it comes from.

31:37.898 --> 31:39.191
Up this way.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.447
Uh, 'cause it comes from
a high place.

31:45.489 --> 31:48.033
'Cause, you know,
gravity and shit.

32:00.796 --> 32:02.089
Thank you!

32:51.930 --> 32:54.057
It's been a while now.

33:02.524 --> 33:04.109
No, sorry.

33:04.151 --> 33:06.403
I mean, yeah, uh, no, good.

33:06.445 --> 33:08.488
Wait -- wait -- wait for me!

33:08.530 --> 33:11.825
Okay, Claire, maybe...

33:15.245 --> 33:16.663
Yeah, but...

33:16.705 --> 33:17.664
It doesn't matt--

33:17.706 --> 33:19.666
[inaudible falling sounds]

33:47.861 --> 33:49.613
Is it safe? Are you good?

33:51.740 --> 33:54.868
Yeah, I smell it too.

33:54.910 --> 33:56.870
Looks pretty nice over there.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.431
Alright, Claire, hear me out.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.855
I don't think this is real.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.817
I don't mean to talk shit
about Bliss yet again.

34:26.859 --> 34:28.652
But just let me say this.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.946
What if...

34:30.987 --> 34:32.489
She's not here.

35:19.536 --> 35:23.874
Being honest with yourself
is not defending yourself.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.626
You're not being attacked.

36:30.649 --> 36:32.442
I'm not pulling you
away from change,

36:32.484 --> 36:35.070
like, the change
can stay and be real.

36:36.238 --> 36:37.656
No, I'm not.

37:24.119 --> 37:25.913
Claire, c'mon.

37:27.915 --> 37:29.625
It's...she...

37:29.666 --> 37:32.878
I don't think this is...maybe...

38:22.469 --> 38:24.304
I'm sorry, Claire.

41:02.838 --> 41:04.381
Don't move it yourself.

49:47.654 --> 49:49.448
Why are you anxious?

54:51.124 --> 54:54.503
Did what Guru Ben tell you
kinda mess you up?

54:55.838 --> 54:57.339
Guru Ben.

1:00:31.715 --> 1:00:33.842
You're doing a great job.

1:00:41.099 --> 1:00:43.018
Uh, yeah, sure.

1:00:46.438 --> 1:00:47.981
Talking.

1:00:48.023 --> 1:00:50.400
Yeah. Claire told me to tell you
she'll be here soon.

1:07:24.294 --> 1:07:27.214
I'll get some, uh...

1:07:27.256 --> 1:07:29.967
Some B shots, I'll get some...
some, yeah.

1:14:31.221 --> 1:14:35.767
I think I...

1:14:35.809 --> 1:14:39.438
(sigh)

1:14:39.479 --> 1:14:43.942
I know a guy, who might,
like, could help.

1:14:48.697 --> 1:14:52.451
He owns an art gallery,
but, like...

1:14:52.492 --> 1:14:54.536
He also helps people.

1:15:00.042 --> 1:15:02.169
He's, uh...

1:15:07.174 --> 1:15:10.677
Yeah, yeah, kinda like a doctor,
he, um...

1:15:10.719 --> 1:15:13.847
He gets drugs, but, like,
good ones, like, um...

1:15:13.889 --> 1:15:15.349
Like [censored]

1:15:15.390 --> 1:15:16.391
And [censored]

1:15:16.433 --> 1:15:18.852
And like [censored]

1:15:18.894 --> 1:15:20.312
Do you wanna?

1:15:23.774 --> 1:15:26.818
I mean, you said ego death,
so it made me think about it.

1:15:53.846 --> 1:15:55.389
Let's do it.

1:15:59.393 --> 1:16:00.894
Alright, let's do it.

1:16:00.936 --> 1:16:02.479
Yeah, I'm sure.

1:16:02.521 --> 1:16:04.314
Yeah.

1:16:11.071 --> 1:16:13.115
If you, yeah, well, I don't know
if he's available right now.

1:16:13.156 --> 1:16:14.741
But, yeah, we'll --
I'll text him.
