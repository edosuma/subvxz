WEBVTT

00:05.618 --> 00:09.000
(theme music)

00:45.145 --> 00:48.313
(regular hubbub)

00:51.818 --> 00:55.287
Just a bit higher, Jake.
(screaming)

00:55.289 --> 00:58.957
Jake! Hold on, Jake.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.960
Oh! Oh God!
(panting)

01:01.962 --> 01:05.230
Oh boy.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.934
Come on, Jake.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.637
Hey, careful!

01:11.639 --> 01:13.872
It's alright.
I know what I'm doing.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.442
Are you some kind of nurse?
A doctor in training.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.177
How deep is it?
I don't know, I...

01:18.179 --> 01:20.112
I think it's
obstructing his windpipe.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.114
Oh God. Hold still, Jake

01:22.116 --> 01:25.150
Oh! Oh no! Please no!

01:25.152 --> 01:27.519
What have you done?

01:27.521 --> 01:30.155
Oh no. Oh no!
Oh no!

01:30.157 --> 01:32.491
Give me something
to staunch the blood.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.794
Sure. Come on. Hold on!

01:35.796 --> 01:38.163
I can't stop it!

01:40.166 --> 01:42.868
No... Jake!!

01:45.171 --> 01:47.106
(panting)

01:53.980 --> 01:56.348
(sniffing and sighing)

01:56.350 --> 01:58.584
Handcuffs are
hardly necessary.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.453
I'm not a common criminal!
You can't do this.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.990
You've got no right.
What's going on, Crabtree?

02:04.992 --> 02:06.792
Sir, we received a call
from a woman who says she found

02:06.794 --> 02:08.894
her silver tea set
in Mr. Crawford's pawnshop.

02:08.896 --> 02:11.363
Her stolen tea set, sir.
'Course it was stolen,

02:11.365 --> 02:13.298
Higgins. We don't arrest people
just for selling a tea set.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.135
What have you got to say
for yourself, Eddie?

02:16.137 --> 02:18.170
My shop's in Station
Five's jurisdiction, Tom.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.172
It's Inspector
Brackenreid to you.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.808
Oh and by the way,
any Toronto Constable

02:22.810 --> 02:25.410
can arrest any thieving bugger
anywhere in the City of Toronto.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.513
Well I'm not paying
twice is all I can say.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.882
Paying twice?

02:29.884 --> 02:33.152
Paying who? For what?
Nothing. Never mind.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.821
Higgins, find Murdoch.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.090
Crabtree, take him
to the interview room.

02:38.092 --> 02:41.760
Sir.
Oh! Ugh...

02:53.373 --> 02:55.207
Look, I didn't know
it was stolen.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.076
She can have her tea set back.
'Course she can have it back.

02:58.078 --> 03:00.145
I'm not interested
in bloody tea sets.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.948
I want to know what you meant.
About what?

03:05.218 --> 03:07.252
About "paying twice."

03:07.254 --> 03:09.922
Uh-It was just a slip
of the tongue, Tom.

03:09.924 --> 03:12.791
Who were you paying?

03:12.793 --> 03:16.361
Someone from
Station House Five?

03:16.363 --> 03:20.265
You were in possession of
stolen merchandise, correct?

03:20.267 --> 03:23.402
As I said before,
I didn't know it was stolen.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.305
Right, Murdoch, I think it's
time we did a complete inventory

03:26.307 --> 03:28.774
of Mr. Crawford's pawnshop.
Right.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.642
O... OK, look...

03:30.644 --> 03:32.978
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.280
I mean, it could get me
into a lot of trouble.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.750
You were making payments
to Station House Number Five.

03:38.752 --> 03:42.387
To whom?
I don't know.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.656
Don't play silly
buggers, Eddie.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.792
I don't. I put the money
in a hollow brick at the back

03:46.794 --> 03:49.628
of my store. And some constable
from Station Five takes it.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.598
We need a name.
The only name I know for sure

03:52.600 --> 03:55.200
is of the fellow who started
collecting back in June '89.

03:55.202 --> 03:58.003
Who was it?
Jeffrey Davis.

03:58.005 --> 04:01.840
Chief Constable Davis?

04:01.842 --> 04:04.243
He was a...
constable back then.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.552
I knew the man was dirty.
That was fourteen years ago.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.989
If Davis was taking money
then, he's taking more now.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.393
We have to take this to the
Mayor and the Board of Control.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.862
Sir, we are talking about
the Chief Constable here.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.164
If we're going
to go after him,

04:26.166 --> 04:29.067
we have to make it stick
or we'll both be out of a job.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.970
I'm willing
to do it if you are.

04:42.382 --> 04:46.018
The glass shard must
have pierced the aorta.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.253
Was the blood under pressure?

04:48.255 --> 04:50.889
It was
just... relentless.

04:50.891 --> 04:54.092
It's possible it may
have punctured the vena cava.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.895
You mean

04:56.897 --> 04:59.598
if I hadn't removed the
shard, he could have lived?

05:03.670 --> 05:06.071
Its removal
may have hastened

05:06.073 --> 05:08.040
blood loss...

05:08.042 --> 05:10.208
but probably wouldn't
have prevented it.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.544
You made
a judgement call,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.413
as all doctors do.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.282
You mustn't
blame yourself.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.922
It was two months
after I opened my store.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.325
Davis claimed I was
fencing stolen goods.

05:26.327 --> 05:29.194
Were you?
Do you want my help or not?

05:29.196 --> 05:31.830
So you made a deal?
$5 a month to leave me alone.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.499
It's 15 now.
(whistling)

05:34.501 --> 05:36.401
It's the cost
of doing business.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.605
What's this?
It's your statement.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.674
Read it over and sign it.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.943
I'm not signing this!

05:44.945 --> 05:48.013
You want to take on
Davis, do it without me.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.883
Sign it... or go to jail.
Well then, lock me up.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.019
You think I'm more scared
of you than I am of Davis?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.621
Do you know what he did
once, when I missed a payment?

05:56.623 --> 05:58.390
Bugger stripped me naked

05:58.392 --> 06:02.794
and kept me in a freezing jail
cell for 2 days. God only knows

06:02.796 --> 06:05.897
what he would do if he found out
I ratted on him.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.533
Right, then. It's off
to the cells with you.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.136
Sir, wait.
Even if he does

06:11.138 --> 06:13.638
sign it, to go
to the Board of Control,

06:13.640 --> 06:15.941
we need more than just the
testimony of a known criminal.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.343
Hey!
We require more evidence

06:18.345 --> 06:21.246
and in order to get that,
we'll need his cooperation.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.482
I'll tell you everything
you want to know,

06:23.484 --> 06:25.450
alright? I'm just
not putting my head

06:25.452 --> 06:28.787
on the block, next to yours and
whoever else you drag into this.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.223
Chief Constable Davis
isn't going to jeopardize

06:31.225 --> 06:33.825
his position
for $15 a month.

06:33.827 --> 06:35.827
You don't think Davis
is behind all this?

06:35.829 --> 06:38.630
What I'm saying is
if Davis is involved in this,

06:38.632 --> 06:40.699
others must be
paying, also.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.901
So, how do we find them?
I've asked George to go

06:42.903 --> 06:45.170
to the police the archives.
Sirs,

06:45.172 --> 06:47.572
the arrest records
from 1890 to the present.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.775
Thank you, George.
What did you want them for?

06:49.777 --> 06:52.077
Never you bloody mind.
Get back to work.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.079
(George sighs, frustrated.)

06:54.081 --> 06:56.281
Don't look at me like
that! Crawford's right;

06:56.283 --> 06:58.150
If they get involved in this
it's their necks on the line

06:58.152 --> 07:01.052
as well. So what do you
want with all this?

07:01.054 --> 07:03.054
I'm only interested in
the ones for Station House

07:03.056 --> 07:05.690
Number Five. We're looking
for businesses targeted

07:05.692 --> 07:09.094
with several arrests followed
by a period of inactivity.

07:09.096 --> 07:12.197
The end of arrests would mean
the start of making payments.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.599
Exactly. I'll make
a list of the businesses

07:14.601 --> 07:17.302
I believe are paying.
And I'll pay them all a visit.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.942
Murdoch.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.281
They were all
making payments

07:29.283 --> 07:31.850
the first Tuesday
of every month.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.319
That's today.
I made it clear to them

07:34.321 --> 07:36.555
they're to continue
making the payments.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.257
Good thinking.
Later, Leslie.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.763
So what now?
We wait for the Constable

07:44.765 --> 07:46.865
from Station House
Number Five to collect,

07:46.867 --> 07:49.301
and we follow
wherever he leads.

07:49.303 --> 07:51.203
How do we prove where
the money came from?

08:00.613 --> 08:02.614
I can't see
a bloody thing.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.250
Exactly. But...

08:05.252 --> 08:08.820
under the ultra-
violet light...

08:12.592 --> 08:15.093
(Brackenreid sniggers.)

08:15.095 --> 08:18.163
You're to use these bills
to make the payment.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.931
Why "these" bills?

08:19.933 --> 08:22.133
Just do it.
You're making

08:22.135 --> 08:24.903
my payment for me?
Don't get excited, Eddie.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.572
We're not making
a habit of this.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.157
I'll follow him,
you take the call box.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.735
Why are you
following me? Inspector!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.572
I saw you making
your pick-ups.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.007
I saw you drop the
money in the call box.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.010
I want to know who it's for.
I just put it in the call box

09:39.012 --> 09:41.646
at the end of my shift. I don't
know where it goes from there.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.015
You're lying!

09:44.017 --> 09:46.284
There's $160
in the pouch.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.187
It should be 165.
Five bucks is my cut.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.756
Look, Constable.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.259
You're standing at
a fork in the road, here.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.761
If you want to come out
of this with your world intact,

09:56.763 --> 09:59.698
you better
start talking.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.567
Well?
I once saw

10:02.569 --> 10:04.869
Constable Shriver take the money
and leave it under a bench

10:04.871 --> 10:06.805
at Allen Gardens. Later,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.074
a man sat on the bench
then left with it.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.910
Who was the man?
If he heard I snitched,

10:11.912 --> 10:14.479
that'd be the end for me.
Tell us who it was

10:14.481 --> 10:17.382
and we'll make sure
he goes to jail, not you.

10:19.151 --> 10:21.086
It was Chief Constable Davis.

10:24.523 --> 10:27.192
I'll keep an eye on the call
box. You go to Allen Gardens.

10:27.194 --> 10:30.295
Whoever picks this up, I'll
follow him and meet you there.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.932
Take this one to Station
House Four on your way.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.301
This way, constable.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.047
(puffing)

10:59.925 --> 11:02.627
You're going the wrong way.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.859
Bollocks. What is she doing?

11:39.298 --> 11:43.201
Just put it back.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.204
Put it back!

11:46.206 --> 11:49.240
Bloody hell. Oy! You
in the mink! Drop it!

11:49.242 --> 11:51.242
(whimpering)

11:57.249 --> 11:59.317
Davis!

12:02.054 --> 12:05.056
Inspector Brackenreid.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.492
You are under arrest

12:07.494 --> 12:10.361
for the possession of the
proceeds of racketeering.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.536
Sir! What's happening?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.572
Get Murdoch.
He's at Allen Gardens.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.574
(someone): What
are they doing?

12:22.576 --> 12:24.342
(someone) Why is..?
Sir--

12:33.786 --> 12:36.821
Good morning, Rebecca.
Are you feeling any better?

12:36.823 --> 12:39.157
I've been doing
some thinking and--

12:39.159 --> 12:41.192
They brought
him in last night,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.528
after you left.

12:43.530 --> 12:47.098
I think you should
conduct the post-mortem.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.200
No.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.804
No, I can't. I'm
responsible for his death.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.340
If you are, you need
to find out how,

12:55.342 --> 12:58.576
and learn from your mistakes
so as not to repeat them.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.548
I don't think I have it
in me to be a doctor.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.651
Nothing I've seen in you
leads me to believe that.

13:06.653 --> 13:10.588
But if you're uncertain,
this is how you find out.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.562
I can't.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.298
A true doctor
needs to make decisions

13:20.300 --> 13:22.734
and live by
those decisions

13:22.736 --> 13:25.370
and never shy away
from the truth.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.039
I'm sorry.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.748
Did you really
feel it necessary

13:36.750 --> 13:38.817
to parade me in handcuffs
in front of my own men?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.052
In my own
Station House?

13:41.054 --> 13:42.887
I don't see this
as being your Station House

13:42.889 --> 13:46.057
for very much longer, Inspector.
(knocking)

13:48.727 --> 13:51.863
Chief Crown Attorney Gordon.
I got your message.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.132
It's as we feared.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.901
Inspector Brackenreid
picked up the money.

13:56.903 --> 14:00.104
(sighing): Do you have
anything to say for yourself?

14:00.106 --> 14:03.808
I'd rather hear what
you two have to say.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.044
Very well.
As you know,

14:06.046 --> 14:08.313
two weeks ago, we uncovered
a racketeering ring

14:08.315 --> 14:10.515
run by Constable Peakes.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.052
From Station House Number
Five. Your old station.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.821
Peakes is dead but
Chief Constable Davis

14:16.823 --> 14:18.756
felt it was important
to investigate to determine

14:18.758 --> 14:21.526
the extent of the corruption.
Oh, did you now?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.962
We discovered
several illegal businesses

14:23.964 --> 14:27.131
were making secret payments.
We know that Peakes ran

14:27.133 --> 14:29.968
the operation. But we wanted
to find out who, if anyone,

14:29.970 --> 14:33.071
had stepped into his place.
We heard rumours

14:33.073 --> 14:35.440
you'd been going to
these businesses demanding

14:35.442 --> 14:37.909
that they continue
to make payments.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.980
You have the right to silence
of course, Inspector, but...

14:41.982 --> 14:45.350
given your position and tenure
with the Toronto Constabulary,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.653
we were rather hoping
you could explain yourself.

14:48.655 --> 14:52.156
I was conducting my own
investigation into corruption

14:52.158 --> 14:54.692
at Station House Five.
Really!

14:54.694 --> 14:57.128
By yourself?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.764
Given the target,
I thought it was wise.

14:59.766 --> 15:03.101
Who was the target?

15:03.103 --> 15:05.637
Chief Constable Davis.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.740
(snigger)

15:08.742 --> 15:10.408
Sir.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.544
What's going on here?

15:13.546 --> 15:16.247
Inspector Brackenreid
has been found

15:16.249 --> 15:18.583
in possession of
the proceeds of corruption.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.920
He claims in his defense
that he was investigating me.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.389
Can you vouch
for this, Murdoch?

15:26.992 --> 15:28.993
Yes. We both were.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.296
Of course
he would say that,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.698
Inspector Brackenreid is his
close friend. He may even be in

15:33.700 --> 15:35.800
on the scheme.
I doubt very much if Murdoch

15:35.802 --> 15:40.004
is on the take. His wife has
more money than he'll ever earn.

15:40.006 --> 15:43.541
All the more reason. Can you
supply corroborating evidence

15:43.543 --> 15:46.311
of anyone else other
than your colleague?

15:46.313 --> 15:49.514
Eddie Crawford.
The pawnbroker?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.516
Crawford's payments
were marked with an ink

15:51.518 --> 15:53.985
that's visible only
under ultra-violet light.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.721
Why would we do that unless
it was our intention to prove

15:56.723 --> 15:59.457
where that money came from?
You make a good point.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.993
If the money is marked,
I'll accept your story.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.902
What am I supposed
to be seeing?

16:13.472 --> 16:16.074
I don't understand.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.809
I do.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.979
Eddie switched the bills.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.481
It was a set-up
from the word go.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.418
Have you any other evidence
to support your claim?

16:27.420 --> 16:30.254
Constable Jenson was
responsible for the pick-ups.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.723
He's in our cells.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.258
Take him to
the Interview Room.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.061
Sir, I believe
Constable Jenson

16:37.063 --> 16:40.365
may speak more freely
if Chief Constable Davis

16:40.367 --> 16:43.501
isn't in the room at the time.
Why is that?

16:43.503 --> 16:47.372
Because he told us the
intended recipient of the money

16:47.374 --> 16:49.073
was Chief Constable Davis.

16:49.075 --> 16:52.610
This is some kind of ploy.
I'll be the judge of that.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.679
I never said the money
was going to Davis.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.581
What did you say?

16:56.583 --> 16:59.550
I told him, as far as I knew,
the money went to Peakes.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.620
But Peakes is dead.
I know.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.757
I-I-I said I don't know
who gets the money now.

17:05.759 --> 17:09.027
Maybe no one. That's
when his eyes lit up.

17:11.930 --> 17:13.931
Get me Eddie Crawford.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.833
Yeah, I told them
I was making payments

17:15.835 --> 17:18.269
but I never said
nothing about Davis.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.139
What about this marked
money they gave you?

17:21.141 --> 17:24.275
They never gave me any money.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.078
You lying bastard!
Sir, sir, sir! Worsley!

17:27.080 --> 17:29.347
Get him out of here.
You just earned yourself

17:29.349 --> 17:31.616
a trip to the cells.
Murdoch, will you escort--

17:31.618 --> 17:34.052
I know my own way.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.423
Sir, Chief
Constable Davis

17:38.425 --> 17:41.426
is behind this. When he
found out Inspector Brackenreid

17:41.428 --> 17:44.162
was on to his corruption, he
conspired with Eddie Crawford

17:44.164 --> 17:47.799
and Constable Jenson
to turn the tables on him.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.268
So far, the only
evidence put forth

17:50.270 --> 17:53.104
suggests that Inspector
Brackenreid attempted to...

17:53.106 --> 17:55.506
insert himself into
a racketeering ring

17:55.508 --> 17:58.009
for personal profit
and nothing else!

17:58.011 --> 18:00.411
Like you, I am a man

18:00.413 --> 18:03.047
of evidence, Detective.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.151
Davis knew that
we knew he was corrupt.

18:07.153 --> 18:10.288
He must have figured we would
eventually uncover the truth.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.724
He used our own
ambition against us.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.127
All these years,
I thought that Davis

18:16.129 --> 18:18.262
was thick. Turns out
the man's a bloody genius.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.432
Sir, our situation is a
product of our own stupidity,

18:21.434 --> 18:24.035
not his brilliance.
In hindsight,

18:24.037 --> 18:25.937
it should have
struck us as suspicious

18:25.939 --> 18:28.940
that two men would
independently point to Davis.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.842
As soon as Shriver
went downtown instead

18:30.844 --> 18:33.478
of Allen Gardens,
I should have smelled a rat.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.379
I wanted to believe.
That was my mistake.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.883
Sir, how did you come
to be holding that money?

18:38.885 --> 18:41.686
A woman in mink
took it out of the bin.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.621
She dropped it as
I gave chase and I was

18:43.623 --> 18:45.857
just about to put it back
when they collared me.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.392
The onus will be on
the prosecution to prove

18:48.394 --> 18:50.862
beyond a reasonable doubt.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.663
It's not about
putting me in jail, Murdoch.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.766
It's about shutting me up.
I'll lose my job,

18:55.768 --> 18:58.369
I'll lose my pension...

18:58.371 --> 19:01.205
Oh God, Margaret
will be in the poorhouse.

19:07.045 --> 19:09.981
Surely there's a chink
in this elaborate scheme.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.783
It's not that
elaborate, Julia.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.319
It simply requires
the testimony of two men

19:15.321 --> 19:18.589
who are sticking to a lie.
What about the woman?

19:18.591 --> 19:21.959
If she hadn't have taken
the money out of the trash,

19:21.961 --> 19:24.228
the Inspector would never
have put his hands on it.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.564
She must be
part of the plot.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.467
Even if I were able

19:29.469 --> 19:31.969
to locate her, Julia,
I fear that she would simply

19:31.971 --> 19:34.405
fold her story in
with the others.

19:34.407 --> 19:37.275
I don't know. The
Constable and the pawnbroker

19:37.277 --> 19:39.510
were both part
of Davis' scheme.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.113
The mystery woman, she
just ran off into the night.

19:42.115 --> 19:45.183
Davis may not have
intended for her to be found.

19:48.620 --> 19:52.256
(door opening)
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

19:52.258 --> 19:55.159
(door closing)
To lose your job, your pension.

19:55.161 --> 19:58.596
To be sent to a prison
with a bunch of convicts

19:58.598 --> 20:01.299
you helped put away.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.435
I hear they don't
take kindly to that.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.138
Come here to rub it in,
have you?

20:07.140 --> 20:10.341
I'm not here to gloat, Tom. I
don't want to see you destroyed

20:10.343 --> 20:13.911
over a momentary...
lapse of judgement.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.781
My only lapse of judgement
was underestimating you.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.550
Yes, but you did

20:19.552 --> 20:23.821
and here we are. Me standing
here and you sitting there.

20:23.823 --> 20:27.825
What is it you want, Davis?
I've come with an offer.

20:29.761 --> 20:33.464
An offer?
A position has opened up

20:33.466 --> 20:35.833
at City Records.
It's not police work

20:35.835 --> 20:37.969
and it won't pay much. But...

20:37.971 --> 20:40.805
you'll keep your pension
and stay out of jail.

20:42.741 --> 20:46.244
And what do you get?
Peace of mind,

20:46.246 --> 20:49.247
knowing that the constables
at Station Five

20:49.249 --> 20:51.983
won't be harassed.
That police manpower

20:51.985 --> 20:54.919
won't be wasted
on fruitless investigations.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.590
You want me
to call off Murdoch.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.927
I want you to understand
that this salvation

21:02.929 --> 21:06.297
I've arranged for you
is contingent.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.400
(Clicks tongue twice.)

21:16.708 --> 21:19.977
Sir, this is blackmail.
We can't just give in.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.480
This is my life
we're taking about, Murdoch.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.016
I may not be a copper
anymore, but at least

21:25.018 --> 21:27.385
my family won't
end up in the poorhouse.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.354
Sir, if you'll just give me a
bit more time, I can prove th--

21:30.356 --> 21:32.890
I've already submitted
my resignation. It's done,

21:32.892 --> 21:35.793
it's over.
Good morning, Detective.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.663
Tom, Mr. Dilbert

21:38.665 --> 21:40.998
in City Records
is expecting you.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.034
I'll be there shortly.
I've just got to get this lot

21:43.036 --> 21:46.537
home first.
Your badge, Tom.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.382
Good luck.
Sir, I still think...

21:58.384 --> 22:01.752
Stand down, Murdoch.
That's an order.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.789
My final order.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.946
(Davis): Get back to work.

22:47.265 --> 22:50.368
Hello, I'm looking
for Mr. Dilbert.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.206
(Ding!)

22:55.208 --> 22:57.375
I'm Dilton Dilbert.
Can I help you?

22:57.377 --> 22:59.477
I'm Thomas Brackenreid.
You're late.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.912
I came as soon as I was able.
I'm not interested in what

23:01.914 --> 23:03.714
you are able to do.
I care only what you do.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.417
This is your key.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.919
Don't lose it.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.722
We open our doors
at eight thirty sharp.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.792
Be here five minutes prior.
Lunch is at twelve. We close

23:14.794 --> 23:16.794
for an hour. Be back
here five minutes prior.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.764
We adhere strictly to the
standards of civic comportment.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.199
In dealing with the public,
your tone of voice will

23:22.201 --> 23:25.403
at all times be
even and articulated.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.606
Cuss words of any
sort will be subject to
an immediate fine of five cents.

23:28.608 --> 23:30.674
Five cents?
Per expletive.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.643
A string of colourful invective
will prove quite costly,

23:32.645 --> 23:35.679
I assure you.
So what do I do?

23:35.681 --> 23:38.616
Hm! You will be replacing
Miss Samantha Shier

23:38.618 --> 23:41.252
and Mr. Kenneth Page
in indexing.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.521
Hello! Goodbye.
We are in the process

23:43.523 --> 23:45.589
of converting to a new
filing system. Essentially,

23:45.591 --> 23:48.292
we're combining the
accessibility of a bound volume

23:48.294 --> 23:51.128
with the mutability
of an open file system.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.731
Every piece of paper
in every file folder

23:53.733 --> 23:56.267
is to be punched and
placed in a two-hole binder

23:56.269 --> 23:59.437
in concordance with the index.
How many file folders
are there?

23:59.439 --> 24:01.605
See for yourself.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.343
Pff... Bloody hell.

24:06.345 --> 24:09.580
That will be ten cents.
How much?

24:09.582 --> 24:11.782
Per expletive.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.885
Detective Murdoch.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.121
Just wanted to let you
know that I'll be overseeing

24:17.123 --> 24:20.124
Station Four until a replacement
for the former Inspector

24:20.126 --> 24:22.593
can be found.
In fact,

24:22.595 --> 24:26.163
I'd encourage you
to apply for the position.

24:26.165 --> 24:29.266
Me?
You seem surprised.

24:31.203 --> 24:34.405
Given my complicity in
attempting to prove that you--

24:34.407 --> 24:39.543
I appreciate your loyalty
to your friend, Detective.

24:39.545 --> 24:42.012
I don't hold grudges.

24:42.014 --> 24:44.882
As long as it is
understood that...

24:44.884 --> 24:48.185
this whole affair is...
water under the bridge.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.860
It is understood?

25:04.102 --> 25:07.104
This is your template.
Lay it over the edge

25:07.106 --> 25:10.574
of the document
and mark the holes...

25:10.576 --> 25:14.111
like... so....

25:14.113 --> 25:17.181
Remember that these
are original documents

25:17.183 --> 25:20.384
so, accuracy is...

25:20.386 --> 25:23.420
essential.
Alright. I'll...

25:23.422 --> 25:26.423
give it a go.
I don't want you
to "give it a go."

25:26.425 --> 25:28.492
I need you to understand that
what we're undertaking here is

25:28.494 --> 25:31.128
nothing less than revolutionary.
If you say so.

25:31.130 --> 25:34.732
(sighing): What
binder is that?

25:34.734 --> 25:37.868
Office Machinery
Acquisitions. Typewriters.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.938
Ah, so, let's say your
typewriter breaks down

25:40.940 --> 25:42.806
and you need to find out
if it's still under warranty.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.875
Where did you last work?
Police Station House

25:44.877 --> 25:47.211
Number Four.
Search in the index for Police

25:47.213 --> 25:49.813
Station Number Four.
Find the volume number

25:49.815 --> 25:52.449
and tab colour. Go to
the volume, find the tab.

25:52.451 --> 25:57.087
Compare the lot numbers and you
have your date of acquisition.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.790
That's very impressive.
Cross indexing is the key.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.927
What do you think
of tab colour versus number?

26:02.929 --> 26:05.329
Colour! You can
see it at a glance.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.665
Hm! It's, uh,
it's my innovation.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.401
Should we have a drink.
Well,

26:10.403 --> 26:13.737
get started and let me know
if you have any questions.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.579
(horses' hooves
on stone pavement)

26:21.581 --> 26:24.615
Miss James?

26:24.617 --> 26:27.251
Are you alright?
Oh, don't mind me.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.720
I'm just-I've had
an upset is all.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.222
Well if misery
loves company,

26:32.224 --> 26:34.425
you have plenty
of it right now.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.727
I heard about
the Inspector.

26:36.729 --> 26:39.964
The Detective says
we'll prove him innocent.

26:39.966 --> 26:43.500
I don't know if we will,
but as my Aunt Marigold says:

26:43.502 --> 26:45.970
"If you don't try,
you'll never know

26:45.972 --> 26:48.973
where trying may
have taken you."

26:48.975 --> 26:52.242
Ah, George.
Come with me, please.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.945
Take care, Miss James.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.813
Sir, what exactly
are we looking for?

27:29.815 --> 27:32.983
The woman who took
the money out of the trashcan.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.252
I can't imagine
she'll still be here, sir.

27:35.254 --> 27:38.422
No, but the impression
she left behind

27:38.424 --> 27:41.525
might still be.
Think about it, George.

27:41.527 --> 27:44.528
If the woman had simply removed
the money from the trash bin

27:44.530 --> 27:46.730
the Inspector would
have known right away

27:46.732 --> 27:49.166
that she was part of the scheme.
Right.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.201
To seem inconspicuous,
she probably threw out

27:51.203 --> 27:53.137
a piece of trash herself.
Exactly. And if we can

27:53.139 --> 27:55.773
identify what that item is, we
may learn something about her.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.309
Well good, it's
all still here.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.211
Yes but, sir, how can we
possibly know which piece

28:01.213 --> 28:04.048
of trash is hers?
It happened after 8:30 p.m.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.984
Now, I need you to
remove all of these items

28:06.986 --> 28:08.919
and take them back
to the Station House,

28:08.921 --> 28:11.522
paying very careful
attention to the order in which

28:11.524 --> 28:14.625
all the items were placed
in the bin. Oh, and George...

28:14.627 --> 28:16.694
Sir?
...Chief Constable Davis

28:16.696 --> 28:18.962
can know nothing of this.
Understood, sir.

28:18.964 --> 28:21.231
Thank you.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.542
This is pointless.
Henry,

28:31.544 --> 28:33.811
this might be the only way
to exonerate the Inspector.

28:33.813 --> 28:37.314
It's also a good exercise in the
logic of detecting. For example,

28:37.316 --> 28:39.616
we know that this paper
is this morning's edition.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.618
So it was obviously
discarded after the woman left.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.587
So, we know
it's not that. Also,

28:43.589 --> 28:46.790
this wrapper is
from a sausage vendor

28:46.792 --> 28:49.259
who, I know, finishes
at six in the evening,

28:49.261 --> 28:51.261
so, unless she was eating
a sausage for two hours,

28:51.263 --> 28:53.497
it can't be that
either. Now,

28:53.499 --> 28:56.567
that leaves us
with these four items.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.769
A broken
ball-and-cup toy,

28:58.771 --> 29:00.738
a glove,
an old sandwich

29:00.740 --> 29:02.740
and a balled up
piece of newspaper.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.742
Detective.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.744
Uh... Chief Constable!

29:06.746 --> 29:09.213
The... Detective
is not in right now.

29:11.649 --> 29:14.485
What is all this?
A-a-all this what?

29:14.487 --> 29:17.755
This garbage.
Garbage?

29:17.757 --> 29:20.424
Don't tell my nephew that.
This is his favourite toy!

29:20.426 --> 29:22.526
I told him I would
fix it for him.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.528
Yes, and I was
just, uh...

29:24.530 --> 29:26.730
enjoying my lunch.
Yeah.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.168
(Higgins laughs sheepishly.)

29:31.170 --> 29:33.036
Fix your toys
on your own time.

29:33.038 --> 29:35.739
Yes sir, of course.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.878
(inaudible whisper and moaning)

29:40.880 --> 29:42.880
W-w-wait!

29:42.882 --> 29:45.282
Higgins! that's evidence!
Aah...

29:48.353 --> 29:50.554
Welcome back, Miss James.

29:52.824 --> 29:56.160
Have you made a determination?
Nothing definitive,

29:56.162 --> 29:58.562
but the shard of glass
completely missed the vena cava.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.565
What about the aorta?
Not even close.

30:01.567 --> 30:04.868
Then, what caused
the hemorrhage?

30:04.870 --> 30:07.504
I don't know yet.
I'm still looking.

30:07.506 --> 30:10.274
Take as much
time as you need.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.435
There's something fishy about
the telegraph machine file.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.204
Fishy?

30:40.206 --> 30:42.439
Not quite right.

30:42.441 --> 30:45.342
There's a purchase order for
a telegraph machine purchased

30:45.344 --> 30:47.544
for Police Station House
Number Four last August.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.279
So?

30:49.281 --> 30:51.849
We never received
a new telegraph machine.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.917
Well, then it's
a content issue.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.853
If there is a discrepancy, that
is the purview of accounting.

30:55.855 --> 30:58.388
We're not here to read the
files, but to file the files.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.425
(frustrated sigh)

31:26.517 --> 31:29.319
Sir. We've determined
these are the only items

31:29.321 --> 31:31.555
that could've been discarded
in the time period in question.

31:31.557 --> 31:35.025
A child's
toy... unlikely.

31:35.027 --> 31:38.161
As is a torn
man's glove.

31:39.931 --> 31:42.733
The sandwich,
a possibility.

31:48.172 --> 31:50.474
I can't imagine
she'll still be here, sir.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.276
No...

31:52.278 --> 31:54.778
but the impressions she left
behind might still be.

31:54.780 --> 31:57.414
She was reading the newspaper
while she was waiting.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.183
It's the evening edition.
Hot off the presses

32:00.185 --> 32:02.252
at eight o'clock, sir.
She likely bought it

32:02.254 --> 32:05.289
from the newsboy
at the corner. Well done!

32:05.291 --> 32:08.325
Yeah, I remember a woman
wearing something like that.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.294
What else can you
tell us about her?

32:10.296 --> 32:13.764
Was she young? Old?
Was she attractive?

32:13.766 --> 32:16.800
Oh no. She was very ugly.
She wore a lot of rouge

32:16.802 --> 32:18.635
and powder, but it didn't
really seem to help

32:18.637 --> 32:20.470
And she...
had an accent.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.472
What kind of accent?
I don't know.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.541
I never heard it before.
(Italian accent) Was it

32:24.543 --> 32:26.543
<i>Italiana?</i> Did she
talk like this?

32:26.545 --> 32:28.845
No.
(Swedish accent): Then maybe

32:28.847 --> 32:32.115
she was Swedish?
No, not that.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.318
(Hungarian accent) Possibly
Hungarian then? She sound like--

32:34.320 --> 32:36.320
George...
That's it!

32:36.322 --> 32:38.889
Really?
She was Hungarian?

32:38.891 --> 32:40.524
If that's what
Hungarians sound like.

32:40.526 --> 32:43.660
That's exactly what
Hungarians sound like.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.929
Uh, anything else?
She had scars on her wrists.

32:45.931 --> 32:48.532
Almost like she tried
to do herself in.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.869
What is all this?

32:52.871 --> 32:56.006
It doesn't just end with
Station House Number Four.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.408
Every Police Station
in Toronto is listed

32:58.410 --> 33:00.310
as receiving equipment
they never got.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.512
How do you know?
I telephoned them.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.215
On city time?
My lunch time.

33:05.217 --> 33:08.352
Look, I understand.
You used to be a policeman.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.121
You see a problem and you want
to... blow your whistle.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.857
But it is not our job
to blow whistles.

33:13.859 --> 33:17.394
If we don't, who will?
We don't just work

33:17.396 --> 33:19.363
for city records, we work
for the City of Toronto.

33:19.365 --> 33:22.966
I will look into it.
How?

33:22.968 --> 33:24.668
I don't know, but there
must be a procedure to follow

33:24.670 --> 33:26.770
and I will follow it.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.839
Thank you.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.748
A Hungarian woman?
Yes. She may have

33:37.750 --> 33:41.518
attempted suicide. The newsboy
saw scars on her wrists.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.888
Sir, perhaps she tried to kill
herself because she was ugly.

33:44.890 --> 33:48.125
She tried wearing powders
and rouge to cover up,

33:48.127 --> 33:50.127
but it didn't work and...
George--

33:50.129 --> 33:52.129
It's just a theory, sir,
but consistent with the facts

33:52.131 --> 33:54.264
as reported.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.633
I thought that, maybe,
if she had attempted suicide

33:56.635 --> 33:59.236
she may have been committed
to the asylum for a period?

33:59.238 --> 34:02.105
The fact that she's Hungarian
narrows the search considerably.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.875
I'll look into it.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.577
Inspector.
I was told I
might find you here.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.579
What is it?
I think I've found

34:09.581 --> 34:11.815
a way to nail Davis.

34:11.817 --> 34:14.618
The fraudulent acquisitions
were all made after October

34:14.620 --> 34:16.653
of last year.
When Inspector Davis

34:16.655 --> 34:18.655
became Chief Constable.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.024
That can't be
a coincidence.

34:25.363 --> 34:28.799
Bloody hell.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.338
Mr. Dilbert,
are you all right?

34:35.340 --> 34:37.774
Who are you?
I'm Detective Murdoch

34:37.776 --> 34:40.577
from Station House Number Four.
I work with the Inspector.

34:40.579 --> 34:44.281
I don't know what happened.
I was compiling the evidence

34:44.283 --> 34:46.817
from city acquisitions and
I heard a noise from behind me

34:46.819 --> 34:48.985
and that's all I remember.
Evidence?

34:48.987 --> 34:52.522
Yes, I'd reported the fraud to
the Board of Controls. They said

34:52.524 --> 34:55.625
to compile any evidence
I could find, so I did

34:55.627 --> 34:59.029
and...

34:59.031 --> 35:03.033
It's gone. Someone's
taken it. All of it!

35:03.035 --> 35:05.669
Mr. Dilbert,

35:05.671 --> 35:07.971
Did you tell anyone else
about this evidence?

35:07.973 --> 35:10.273
Of course not. I adhered
strictly to procedure.

35:10.275 --> 35:12.509
It must be the Board of
Control that's behind this.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.811
Or elements thereof.
This is a lot bigger

35:14.813 --> 35:17.781
than Davis.
Mr. Dilbert,

35:17.783 --> 35:19.382
would you be willing to help
us bring down the people

35:19.384 --> 35:22.119
who did this to you?
Damn right.

35:24.222 --> 35:27.524
Swear jar.

35:27.526 --> 35:29.659
So, Alderman Hubbard,
what do you make of all this?

35:29.661 --> 35:32.062
I'm not surprised.

35:32.064 --> 35:33.864
I used to be on
the Board of Control.

35:33.866 --> 35:37.701
There are two men on the board
I've long suspected of graft,

35:37.703 --> 35:39.703
but their support runs
deep into City Council.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.805
Do you think the Mayor
could be involved?

35:41.807 --> 35:45.008
No. Almost certainly not.
But I can't go to the Mayor

35:45.010 --> 35:48.712
with only suspicions.
How is this for evidence?

35:48.714 --> 35:51.648
Insufficient given the
magnitude of the accusation.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.317
What about Chief
Constable Davis?

35:54.319 --> 35:57.020
He's involved in this alright,
but until we can prove there is

35:57.022 --> 36:00.590
a "this" we're still
no further ahead. Unless...

36:00.592 --> 36:03.093
What about the woman
he hired to set me up?

36:03.095 --> 36:05.195
Right. Julia, did you
find out anything?

36:05.197 --> 36:07.764
Yes. There was a Hungarian
admitted to the asylum

36:07.766 --> 36:09.766
after a suicide attempt
two years ago.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.870
Did she cut her wrists?
No, "he" cut "his" wrists.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.373
"He"?
Oh.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.609
Oh, but...
the newsboy did say

36:19.611 --> 36:21.745
that she was
rather unattractive.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.381
If we could get
this person to cooperate,

36:24.383 --> 36:27.517
perhaps we could strike
some kind of deal with Davis

36:27.519 --> 36:29.920
in exchange for testimony.
A bloody deal?

36:29.922 --> 36:32.923
No chance. Bollocks to that.
After what he's bloody done,

36:32.925 --> 36:35.192
he going straight
to bloody jail. And no,

36:35.194 --> 36:38.261
you're not getting
another sodding nickel.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.230
Sir, there's a lot more
at stake here than just

36:40.232 --> 36:42.232
Chief Constable Davis.

36:42.234 --> 36:45.869
What's the patient's name?
Vidor Szabó.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.104
Do you have an address?
I do.

36:48.106 --> 36:51.508
(voices and bells)

36:59.617 --> 37:02.452
(knocking)

37:02.454 --> 37:04.454
Police.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.591
Remember me?
No. Why would I?

37:07.593 --> 37:10.160
We had a brief encounter a
short while back. You dropped

37:10.162 --> 37:11.995
a leather pouch full
of money, I picked it up.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.431
No. I was never there.

37:14.433 --> 37:17.100
Where?
Where you were.

37:17.102 --> 37:20.704
Sir, is this the mink
stole she was wearing?

37:20.706 --> 37:23.406
Yes that's it. Odd;

37:23.408 --> 37:25.976
a woman's mink stole
in the room of a bachelor.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.947
I dress up occasionally
at certain events

37:30.949 --> 37:33.650
that cater
like-minded sorts.

37:33.652 --> 37:36.219
Then, a couple
of weeks back,

37:36.221 --> 37:39.556
we were raided
by the constabulary.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.459
I thought
my life was over.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.494
Instead, I got
a visit.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.496
From Chief Constable Davis.

37:46.498 --> 37:50.100
All charges
were dropped

37:50.102 --> 37:53.003
in exchange
for a favour.

37:53.005 --> 37:55.205
If you wore the dress and
pretended to steal the money.

37:55.207 --> 37:58.275
Have us look for a woman
instead of a man.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.944
Davis continues to impress me.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.047
I'll tell you what:
We'll make our own deal.

38:04.049 --> 38:07.417
Your freedom for
your signed confession.

38:14.191 --> 38:16.459
No.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.795
I'm not going up
against that man.

38:18.797 --> 38:22.599
He would kill me.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.176
(sound of a door)

38:33.178 --> 38:36.713
Good Lord, Rebecca!

38:36.715 --> 38:40.050
When did you get in?
I haven't left.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.952
You've been here all night?
I had to know.

38:42.954 --> 38:46.423
I wouldn't have slept otherwise.
And have you an answer?

38:46.425 --> 38:49.225
I have.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.494
The deceased had
an aortic aneurysm causing

38:51.496 --> 38:54.597
a massive hemorrhage. That's
why he fell from the ladder.

38:54.599 --> 38:57.867
When I turned him over, his
lungs collapsed, and the blood

38:57.869 --> 39:00.403
that had pooled in his abdomen
entered his chest cavity.

39:00.405 --> 39:02.505
Then, you removed
the shard, allowing the blood

39:02.507 --> 39:04.240
to flow out of his body.

39:04.242 --> 39:07.377
It neither hastened
nor retarded his death.

39:07.379 --> 39:11.514
You're absolved.
Yes.

39:11.516 --> 39:15.852
You know you didn't
need absolution.

39:15.854 --> 39:19.489
Yes, but it feels good
to know I have it all the same.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.562
How difficult is it to find
a man's address, George?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.731
Sir, I've tried. But he's got
one of those Hungarian names

39:27.733 --> 39:31.134
that are tricky to spell.
This is how you spell it.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.937
S-Z..? Sir,

39:33.939 --> 39:36.573
how could I possibly know
they'd throw a zed in there?

39:36.575 --> 39:41.044
What is this
is all about?

39:41.046 --> 39:44.314
Sir, we're trying
to locate a suspect

39:44.316 --> 39:46.416
involved in a...
A robbery

39:46.418 --> 39:48.952
on Albert St.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.121
Which we should be
getting back to.

39:51.123 --> 39:54.824
Yes.
So...

40:12.109 --> 40:15.845
You're leaving town.
I'll pay your way.

40:15.847 --> 40:19.616
I don't want to leave.
I don't care what you want.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.819
You're leaving. Now.

40:22.821 --> 40:26.489
I dressed up. I took
the money from the trash bin.

40:26.491 --> 40:29.659
You said that would be it.
We had an agreement!

40:29.661 --> 40:33.630
(sobbing)

40:33.632 --> 40:36.232
Stop blubbering and start
packing. I have a carriage

40:36.234 --> 40:39.502
waiting. Stop your blubbering!
I've heard enough.

40:42.773 --> 40:46.509
Chief Constable Davis,
you're under arrest.

40:46.511 --> 40:49.279
We heard everything.
Really?

40:49.281 --> 40:52.248
I didn't say anything.
Did you say anything?

40:52.250 --> 40:54.918
No.
I'm afraid it's your word

40:54.920 --> 40:57.821
against ours.

40:57.823 --> 41:02.091
And our deal is off. Looks like
you're going to jail after all.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.961
You've forgotten
who I work with.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.932
<i>I dressed up. I took</i>
<i>the money from the trash bin.</i>

41:08.934 --> 41:12.368
<i>You said that would be it.</i>
<i>We had an agreement!</i>

41:12.370 --> 41:16.272
(slapping and sobbing)

41:16.274 --> 41:18.641
<i>Stop blubbering and start</i>
<i>packing. I have a carriage</i>

41:18.643 --> 41:24.113
<i>waiting. Stop you blubbering.</i>

41:29.186 --> 41:31.187
Well played, Tom.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.890
It's Inspector to you.

41:33.892 --> 41:36.426
They've rescinded
my resignation.

41:36.428 --> 41:38.428
Congratulations.

41:38.430 --> 41:40.930
Of course, it's not
looking so good for you.

41:40.932 --> 41:43.166
Fraud, racketeering,

41:43.168 --> 41:45.301
assault.
What do you want?

41:45.303 --> 41:49.239
A full confession, including
your assault on Mr. Dilbert

41:49.241 --> 41:52.509
and your collusion
with the Board of Control.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.413
I can't give you the Board.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.549
Your choice.

41:59.551 --> 42:02.552
You can have a job
and keep your pension...

42:02.554 --> 42:04.754
or you can do five to ten
in the company of men

42:04.756 --> 42:07.123
you've sent to prison.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.392
They don't take
kindly to that, I hear.

42:09.394 --> 42:12.295
What's the job?
It just so happens

42:12.297 --> 42:15.231
there's an opening
in City Records.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.233
(clicks of the tongue)

42:22.139 --> 42:24.541
(applause)
(someone): Welcome back!

42:24.543 --> 42:28.578
Sir, welcome back.
Ah! It's good to be back,

42:28.580 --> 42:30.813
thank you, Crabtree.
Your office awaits, sir,

42:30.815 --> 42:34.817
but first...
Ah. Alderman Hubbard.

42:42.159 --> 42:45.161
I apologize for intruding
on your homecoming.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.564
I just came by to thank you
for helping me clean up

42:47.566 --> 42:50.633
the Board of Control.
I was just doing my job.

42:50.635 --> 42:53.903
I know it
involved a sacrifice.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.140
That's alright. Davis got
what was coming to him.

42:57.142 --> 43:01.778
How about a drink?
Absolutely.

43:01.780 --> 43:04.247
Every piece of paper
in every file folder

43:04.249 --> 43:06.249
is to be punched and
placed in a two-hole binder

43:06.251 --> 43:09.519
in concordance with the index.
And how many...

43:09.521 --> 43:12.722
file folders are there?
You can see for yourself.

43:20.230 --> 43:23.967
Bloody hell.
That will be ten cents.

43:23.969 --> 43:28.004
How much?
Per expletive.

43:32.109 --> 43:36.512
