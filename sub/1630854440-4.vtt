WEBVTT

00:41.751 --> 00:45.463
The construction ditch in front
of the fire access door was a nice touch.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.631
I know some people who know some people.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.136
You know I take date night very seriously.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.304
Present.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.085
Mmm.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.838
It's going to be very
dangerous eating soup in space.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.715
That had not occurred to me.

01:29.715 --> 01:33.886
Mm. Yeah, it's gonna be
hot soup blobs flying around

01:33.886 --> 01:35.304
the speed of light,
hitting you in the eye.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.431
 You're gonna
need soup goggles.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.433
 I'm going to have
Breanna make you soup soggles.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.477
Hey, I'm only going
to space for two months.

01:41.477 --> 01:44.563
- Of course. You're not going forever.
- No.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.440
Definitely not gonna
accidentally open a window,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.776
get flash frozen, and start
circling in the infinite darkness.

01:49.985 --> 01:53.239
We should not have watched <i>Buck Rogers.</i>
That's on me.

01:53.239 --> 01:54.782
I mean, how far away is your satellite?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.951
It's in the exosphere,
what, 400 miles away?

01:56.951 --> 01:57.993
Pssh. Peanuts.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.370
Babe, you want to talk about this...

01:59.370 --> 02:01.580
Speaking of peanuts, what is in the soup?

02:01.580 --> 02:03.707
It smells like peanuts.
Like a sandwich.

02:03.707 --> 02:04.917
Chicken.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.002
Uh-huh. It's good.

02:15.678 --> 02:19.181
Look, pal, I know you're not
exactly jazzed about going to this party.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.685
But I think your grandma
would have wanted you to go.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.311
And she always said that
you were the only one

02:24.311 --> 02:26.021
that loved the art as much as she did.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.648
I know.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.734
 And you might feel like you just
lost your only family.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.694
I miss her, too.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.490
And if you need family, I would
like to be considered for the position.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.535
I just miss her so much.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.748
I don't want to go to this party.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.792
I want to talk to people I don't know.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.586
I know, buddy. I miss her, too.

02:48.586 --> 02:52.006
And I know that it's not fair that
you've inherited all this responsibility.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.551
And people are going to try
to get close to you because of that.

02:55.551 --> 02:56.552
But I tell you what.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.971
Tonight, you don't have to talk to anyone.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.514
You can even play your game.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.143
Just put in some facetime
and then go do your thing.

03:04.143 --> 03:05.227
Team up.

03:18.324 --> 03:21.911
So what do we do for the rest
of our big date night?

03:21.911 --> 03:23.329
Grab a drink?

03:23.329 --> 03:25.122
We could go axe throwing.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.082
No. They asked us not to come back.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.585
<i>Reroute in progress.</i>

03:29.585 --> 03:30.794
Hmm.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.005
It's a traffic jam. We're being rerouted.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.757
Take that left turn. That looks clear.

03:40.930 --> 03:41.847
Is that...?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.557
Safe Haven Freeport.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.851
Although technically
within the US borders,

03:45.851 --> 03:48.187
because of tax purposes, it doesn't exist.

03:48.187 --> 03:52.066
Hmm. Both here and not
here at the same time. Spooky.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.778
You know,
as an international tax free zone,

03:55.778 --> 03:58.989
it's a pretty great place
to store your very expensive art

03:58.989 --> 04:01.450
if you're super rich
and you don't want to pay taxes.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.120
Hm. Millions of dollars worth of
art just sitting there, ready to steal.

04:06.121 --> 04:11.001
But the whole point of a
freeport is that it's got insane security.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.629
- It's just a coincidence.
- Hm.

04:13.629 --> 04:17.383
I heard that the codes on the vault's
magnetic locks are uncrackable

04:17.383 --> 04:19.635
because they change every 12 hours

04:19.635 --> 04:22.680
and you need a biometric scan
to get the new one.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.892
"Just a coincidence," but I heard

04:26.892 --> 04:30.354
that not only is the vault door's
mechanical lock un-pickable,

04:30.354 --> 04:32.523
but the door's
surrounded by pressure sensors

04:32.523 --> 04:34.733
so you can't even
get close enough to try.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.070
- You know what I also heard?
- What you hear?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.906
That millionaire
Lillian Baxter Cartland Jones

04:40.906 --> 04:42.491
kept her collection in there.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.369
That's a coincidence.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.956
- She just passed. Moment of silence.
- Mm.

04:49.623 --> 04:53.419
Mm. They're throwing a viewing party
tonight in honor of her

04:53.419 --> 04:55.546
showing off a few of her favorite pieces.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.549
Well, hm. In that case,

04:58.549 --> 05:00.676
nobody's going to be
paying attention to the vaults.

05:00.676 --> 05:01.635
Yeah.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.722
Did you know that
she has a T-Rex skull in there?

05:04.722 --> 05:06.432
And the Countess Lucia Watch.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.392
- Unpickable.
- Unbreakable.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.562
So you want to break in?

05:11.895 --> 05:16.025
Mm. Well, we are already
dressed for a party.

05:16.025 --> 05:17.735
Let me get us on the guest list.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.966
Well, you both look so beautiful.
Thank you very much for coming.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.468
It means a lot to us.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.261
We just hope little Mason's okay.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.436
Thanks.
Survival clauses have my head spinning.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.315
All right, this place must
be worth a few dozen mil.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.902
- But no dinosaur.
- Mm. No watch either.

05:59.902 --> 06:01.779
It must still be in Lillian's vault.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.948
Thanks, everyone, for coming tonight.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.701
Lillian would have been
so happy to see you all here.

06:07.701 --> 06:11.663
The only thing that she loved
more than her art was Mason here.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.834
And what she loved almost as
much was sharing art with others.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.466
And that's our cue.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.056
Well, couldn't be a
party without a party foul, right?

06:30.099 --> 06:31.850
Thanks, everybody.
Please enjoy the evening.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.444
Said to wear layers.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.033
Oh, look. Weird.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.829
These are the suction cups people use

06:51.829 --> 06:53.747
to move glass display cases.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.208
Who would leave these here?

06:56.208 --> 06:59.294
Huh. Oh, look at this!

07:00.212 --> 07:01.839
An elevator access key.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.799
People can be so careless.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.636
But to make the elevator actually run,
we need a vault owner.

07:07.636 --> 07:10.806
Because we need a biometric scan
to make it run.

07:10.806 --> 07:13.142
But to get into the shaft...

07:20.649 --> 07:23.402
Elevator's in the basement. Convenient.

07:23.986 --> 07:25.571
Looks like we'll have to
take the cable up.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.531
Hey.

07:27.865 --> 07:28.991
Fine.

07:33.203 --> 07:34.830
You have to let go.

07:34.830 --> 07:35.914
No, I'm not--

07:35.914 --> 07:36.915
I got you!

07:36.915 --> 07:38.625
I got--

07:40.210 --> 07:42.921
Gonna go to space
but is afraid of heights. Pssh!

07:45.215 --> 07:47.301
I'm proud of me.
That's all that matters.

08:05.027 --> 08:08.655
- I knew it.
- It's not unpickable at all.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.741
Hardly, but time consuming.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.868
The Glen reader plate is the problem.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.953
Once you step on it, you have ten seconds

08:14.953 --> 08:17.414
to enter the keypad code and combination.

08:17.414 --> 08:22.377
So how does one get to the
door without touching the floor?

08:35.224 --> 08:37.351
- Hmm.
- How's it going with that visual keypad?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.102
Oh, I did write a new algorithm.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.896
Ooh, that's exciting.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.274
You know, most people think that
Ketones are all identical,

08:44.274 --> 08:47.653
but a little wear and tear,
a few variations in circuitry,

08:47.653 --> 08:49.154
you can actually tell the difference.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.448
Unfortunately,
after I've sampled the keypad,

08:51.448 --> 08:53.742
I'd need a recording
of somebody entering the code.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.244
Check your voicemail.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.334
Was you?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.794
Here come your tones.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.095
I'm on my last tumble.

09:38.662 --> 09:39.746
Sue says hi.

09:44.251 --> 09:48.338
Bartolo spent 20 years
perfecting this watch for Lucia.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.842
I'm still not sure that's sanitary.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.387
This head is 150 million years old.

09:55.387 --> 09:59.016
How many people can say
they tasted something that old?

09:59.766 --> 10:01.852
Not many. Babe...

10:03.895 --> 10:06.606
- I'm so glad we did this.
- Me, too.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.068
You weren't that subtle about it.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.864
Neither were you, Miss "Oh,
somehow I got a recording of the keypad."

10:14.990 --> 10:16.241
How long you been planning this?

10:16.241 --> 10:17.951
Mm. About as long as you, I bet.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.288
- Was that you?
- No. Was that you?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.331
No.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.583
It's no big deal, though.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.377
Just the magnetic locks,
not the mechanicals.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.838
Let me just try the code again.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.595
- Something's wrong.
- That's not good.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.853
Hands up, everybody.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.899
Stay calm.
We have taken control of the building.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.401
This is a robbery.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.787
If we can get the sound of the code,

11:01.787 --> 11:03.455
Hardison can hack the keypad.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.873
A code that's impossible to access?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.875
In a building that's
impossible to get through?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.126
It's the Countess Lucia watch.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.503
It's a T-Rex skull.

11:09.503 --> 11:12.547
Didn't Parker break
into that museum in Chicago last summer

11:12.547 --> 11:14.007
and lick that T-Rex skull?

11:14.007 --> 11:16.343
Yeah, that was Sue.
She's licked Sue twice.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.804
I think this is the only T-Rex skull
that she hasn't licked.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.013
It's on her list.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.807
I can't believe
you're going into space, man.

11:21.807 --> 11:22.974
The exosphere.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.059
Don't make him nervous.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.394
"Nervous"? Ain't nobody nervous.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.562
Look, it's not about me,
it's about Parker.

11:27.562 --> 11:31.483
She has been acting a little
sensitive about you leaving this time.

11:31.483 --> 11:35.570
Hardison just needs something to remind
him how awesome it is here on Earth.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.739
I don't get it.
Are you trying to get him to stay?

11:37.739 --> 11:40.242
Of course not. He's got super important
satellite stuff to do.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.244
I'm just trying to give him one
big adventure--

11:42.244 --> 11:44.538
To last for the whole time I'm up there.

11:44.538 --> 11:46.373
Well, that's a pretty high bar.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.626
Hence Freeport.
Bigger security, bigger challenge.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.044
But I need your help.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.296
I'm gonna end up getting
kicked and punched on this, aren't I?

11:53.296 --> 11:56.258
- On your date.
- No, I promise.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.552
But remember, it's a surprise.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.554
So under no circumstances...

12:00.554 --> 12:04.683
Can you say a word to Hardison
or anyone else on the team. Got it?

12:04.683 --> 12:05.809
Got it.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.859
You sure you want to do this?
It's a big job.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.653
Freeports are
almost impossible to break into.

12:16.653 --> 12:20.532
It's romantic. Don't you want to
help our friends with their date night?

12:20.532 --> 12:23.201
What am I doing?
I'm making a four course meal for 'em.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.829
- Yeah, Chef.
- It has to travel. It has to reheat.

12:25.829 --> 12:26.788
Yeah, Chef.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.415
Hardison's got to serve it on a rooftop.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.958
That's not how that works, by the way.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.668
I got tickets to the basketball game.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.128
Well, we're all pitching in.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.256
Oh, except for Breanna.
She's excused for the evening.

12:36.256 --> 12:40.010
- W-w-why?
- I have my own date. Thank you.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.888
Oh, yeah, with Allie,
who does the kinetic sculpture.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.764
- Ahh!
- What?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.725
It was your first second date since Emily.

12:46.725 --> 12:49.102
You were excited, so I was excited.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.604
The job's a breeze.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.023
Three elements.
We need an elevator access key,

12:53.023 --> 12:56.276
someone to kill the cameras
at the right moment, and a distraction.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.571
- And an individualized biometric code.
- And that.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.699
We told our friends we'd help
them break into dear Lillian's vault,

13:02.699 --> 13:04.159
and that's what we're going to do.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.912
You know, second date,
I think I'd make quite the impression

13:06.912 --> 13:08.914
if I cooked her a meal.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.832
Yeah, yeah, it works. You should.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.960
So, dear Lillian did you know her?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.880
No, but I like her style.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.883
Lillian Baxter Cartland Jones.

13:19.883 --> 13:22.219
She inherited her
wealth from her second husband.

13:22.219 --> 13:23.803
And then when he popped his clog,

13:23.803 --> 13:26.306
she dedicated herself to philanthropy,

13:26.306 --> 13:30.560
collecting art,
and marrying progressively younger men.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.313
Respect. And Lillian's the reason why

13:33.313 --> 13:34.731
it's not impossible
to get into the building

13:34.731 --> 13:35.982
because...

13:37.317 --> 13:39.277
All I'm saying
is that you're an excellent cook.

13:39.277 --> 13:40.612
You're making one meal,
why not make a second?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.614
Think about it. Hook me up. Come on.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.782
What?

13:43.782 --> 13:47.327
Lillian's widower,
the ex-tennis pro, Justin,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.496
he's holding a memorial for her
at the Freeport,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.957
showing off some of her art.
That's our in.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.750
Justin. He's our access to the vault?

13:53.750 --> 13:57.712
Uh-uh. No. Lillian's main heir
is her grandson, Mason.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.173
She raised him since he was six.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.633
He's the one with the access.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.594
And luckily, Mason is a big fan of
the Spirit's Ruse mobile game.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.972
What? You can play it on your phone now?!

14:06.972 --> 14:08.932
Oh, man, you missed it.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.018
Okay, thanks to us,
the OG game came back big time.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.770
So they made
a mobile game out of it, right?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.856
So basically you can
find digital spirits on a real map.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.775
There's even this part in the CBD,

14:18.775 --> 14:20.694
it's known for having Wise Swans.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.404
That's where I'm going to clone his phone.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.574
So our only problem is not knowing
what items are going to be on display.

14:25.574 --> 14:29.369
We have to make sure that the watch
and the dinosaur skull are in the vault.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.413
That'll be my job.
Breanna, you're on the vault code.

14:31.413 --> 14:34.457
Harry, Eliot,
you come in to play at the party.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.668
This one's adorable.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.713
Let's go steal a date night.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.719
Oh, and she's a vegan.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.348
Keep that in mind.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.608
Justin, it says there's a Wise Swan.
Can I?

15:00.317 --> 15:03.236
Sure thing, buddy. Just stay
close enough for me to see you, okay?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.071
Okay.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.500
- Yes!
- Ooh!

15:20.003 --> 15:22.380
- Sorry.
- Yo, Wise Swan.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.591
- Yeah.
- Dude, cool!

15:28.178 --> 15:29.387
Fire Dryad!

15:30.096 --> 15:32.307
I was here first. It's my Fire Dryad!

15:32.766 --> 15:33.975
No! Come on!

15:36.394 --> 15:37.896
Justin, get the door.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.837
Stop! No.
You're not bringing that in here.

16:02.837 --> 16:06.341
Am I the only person with
any artistic integrity?

16:06.341 --> 16:09.552
That monstrosity
is throwing off the entire display.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.513
Excuse me, who are you?

16:11.513 --> 16:14.265
Sharon Hopkins, art curator.

16:14.265 --> 16:18.103
Take it away and bring me art.
A-R-T. Art.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.481
I'm Donald Farmingworth,
owner of Safe Haven Freeport.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.776
I wasn't informed
of any curator for this viewing.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.487
The estate hired me a week ago.
Check your email.

16:28.780 --> 16:32.784
Regardless, the dinosaur is
one of Miss Lillian's favorite pieces.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.369
Mr. Farmingworth,
do you really want

16:34.369 --> 16:38.540
the guests here tonight to think that
your high-end storage facility

16:38.540 --> 16:42.001
is trusted to the world's
most valuable and dynamic art?

16:42.001 --> 16:47.382
Or that it's little more than a
footlocker for some dusty old bones?

16:48.258 --> 16:53.221
Yes. Ah. The Waldman. That's perfect.

16:53.221 --> 16:56.182
Bring me the Waldman.
Big painting, full of ducks.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.892
You can't miss it. Chop chop.

16:57.892 --> 17:00.729
You heard her.
Now go, get that out of here.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.092
What's up, brother?
You the day shift?

17:31.426 --> 17:33.511
Yeah. Where's Bob?

17:37.182 --> 17:38.057
Hello?

17:38.057 --> 17:42.228
<i>This is Mad Dog Austin from 102.4.</i>

17:42.228 --> 17:45.148
<i>We're giving away two tickets
to tonight's sold-out game</i>

17:45.148 --> 17:47.692
<i>and you are our lucky winner!</i>

17:47.692 --> 17:50.403
- You're kidding me! That's great!
- Oh, my God.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.155
I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.324
The game! I'm going to the game!

17:54.824 --> 17:56.743
- Good for you!
- Yeah!

17:57.494 --> 17:58.995
Ahhh!

17:59.454 --> 18:01.623
Yes. Thank you.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.708
I wonder where they got
an extra basketball ticket.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.377
Something came up I guess.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.880
You can go ahead and head out.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.216
Actually, I'm cool to pull a double.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.760
I could use the overtime.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.346
Well, don't be silly, man.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.640
Get home. Enjoy the evening.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.433
Maybe I'll stick around
and help you out anyway.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.768
I don't mind.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.858
<i>You know,
I could have done Eliot's job on this.</i>

18:28.858 --> 18:30.360
It's just pushing a button.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.028
It's a two person distraction.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.989
Besides, this is
the perfect opportunity for you

18:34.989 --> 18:36.616
to hone your conversational skills.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.827
I'm a lawyer. That's all I do is converse.

18:38.827 --> 18:43.456
As a grifter, you also need to observe.
Right?

18:44.666 --> 18:48.169
Let's see who's here we can target.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.172
He's expecting
a few more Richie Rich types.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.591
It's got more of
a random assortment, isn't there?

18:53.591 --> 18:56.803
Oh, I guess Lillian
was more than a collector of art.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.222
Well, that explains
marrying the tennis pro.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.223
Hmm.

19:00.223 --> 19:04.018
Okay, judging by his hands,
he's a violinist.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.729
And her, she's a champion bridge player.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.190
Judging by her shoes, she's a barista.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.234
My barista has shoes just like that.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.278
Excellent. She's your first target.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.030
Remember,
leave an open space and the mark

19:16.030 --> 19:17.532
will fill it with what
they want you to be.

19:22.537 --> 19:24.998
Well, this is a lovely tribute to Lily.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.875
It was perfect.
She'd love it.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.377
Oh, were you, uh, close?

19:29.377 --> 19:33.214
Yeah. She was, uh, always trying
to get me to focus my potential.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.425
She liked how I did the books
at the coffee shop,

19:35.425 --> 19:36.968
so she made me executor to her will.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.596
Yeah. At first I was shocked,

19:39.596 --> 19:41.347
but now I think it's really cool.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.473
Huh.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.767
I'm actually studying to be a paralegal.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.353
Oh, well, hey, I'm a lawyer myself.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.730
- Oh.
- Harry Wilson.

19:48.730 --> 19:51.608
If you have any questions before
you take your exam, give me a call.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.276
Yeah. Thanks.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.361
Survival clauses have my head spinning.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.617
Thanks, everyone, for coming tonight.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.202
Lillian would have been
so happy to see you all here.

20:03.494 --> 20:07.040
The only thing that she loved
more than her art was Mason here.

20:07.290 --> 20:11.461
And what she loved almost as
much was sharing art with others.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.504
Ah-choo!

20:16.716 --> 20:19.719
Well, couldn't be a
party without a party foul, right?

20:21.179 --> 20:23.389
Thanks, everyone.
Enjoy the evening.

20:23.389 --> 20:27.018
Hardison and Parker are out of
the party and on the way to the vault,

20:27.018 --> 20:29.687
<i>So Eliot, where are we
with cutting the cameras?</i>

20:29.687 --> 20:33.274
Well, it looks like we're stuck
here together for the night, huh?

20:33.274 --> 20:36.945
- Eliot, we need to go to--
- I'm going to go take a lap of rounds.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.616
There's something about this guy.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.118
What, like a distinctive haircut?

20:44.118 --> 20:45.828
It's not a distinctive anything.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.539
That's what's so distinctive.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.416
All right, I'm gonna cut the cameras.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.379
Mm. About as long as you, I bet.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.632
Uh, somebody cut the cameras.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.259
- It wasn't me.
- It was me.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.473
Mason?

21:17.360 --> 21:18.277
What is it?

21:18.778 --> 21:22.281
Those two men deliberately
avoiding eye contact.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.367
Ooh. Buckle up.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.786
There's going to be a robbery.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.374
Hands up, everybody. Stay calm.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.668
We have taken control of the building.

21:34.335 --> 21:36.337
This is a robbery.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.097
Is there a failsafe?

21:46.097 --> 21:48.558
I thought if it didn't work
the seventh time, it'll work the eighth.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.893
You're right.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.396
The time for optimism has passed.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.647
You had help?

21:55.064 --> 21:56.107
So did you.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.025
- <i>Sophie.</i>
- <i>Harry.</i>

21:57.025 --> 21:58.067
<i>What's going on?</i>

21:58.067 --> 21:59.736
Oh, you know, getting robbed at gunpoint.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.237
- How about you?
- <i>We're stuck in the vault.</i>

22:01.237 --> 22:02.947
What do you mean "being robbed"?
Like a guy with a gun?

22:02.947 --> 22:04.365
- You know, "Stick 'em up"?
- Mm-hmm.

22:04.365 --> 22:05.491
Pretty much.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.785
The leader's name is Nick.

22:07.785 --> 22:11.080
Again, we have
locked all exits from the building.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.167
There is no point in trying to
go anywhere.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.877
Phones and wallets, please.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.256
Eliot, how did they
get control of the building?

22:22.091 --> 22:24.052
I'm gonna need a minute.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.433
- Army?
- One tour.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.480
- All right.
- Why do you ask?

22:35.480 --> 22:38.900
Basic style.
No advanced technique. Watch this.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.493
Jimmy pulled the lockdown switch.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.412
<i>I think you're gonna need the
Freeport owner's key to undo it.</i>

22:51.412 --> 22:53.873
Well, the owner is stuck in here with us.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.708
And the plot thickens.
Stop licking.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.961
Hardison, I'll go try
and find another way out. Eliot?

22:58.961 --> 23:01.089
Yeah, I'll go see
if I can find an override.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.715
Or just cut the power off.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.054
We're running out of options.

23:08.763 --> 23:10.723
We could just stay here.
It's kind of cozy.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.558
"Cozy"? Babe, ain't nothing up in here

23:12.558 --> 23:14.393
but dust mites, dead things,

23:14.393 --> 23:16.813
and probably some degenerative disease.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.898
I know, but it's kind of romantic, right?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.691
Almost takes your breath away.

23:20.691 --> 23:25.154
Yeah, uh, tonight I was going for,
like, a fairytale romance,

23:25.154 --> 23:27.824
not a "they'll find our dead bodies
huddled in a corner because

23:27.824 --> 23:30.243
we didn't get water or food for three
days" kind of romance.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.828
Why would that be so wrong?

23:31.828 --> 23:33.412
Dying wrapped in each other's arms

23:33.412 --> 23:35.331
surrounded by millions of dollars
worth of art.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.918
I mean, at least that way
we'd be together until the end.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.170
Is everything okay?

23:41.170 --> 23:44.423
I mean, aside from
the obviously impending doom?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.550
Sure.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.930
All right, I hate to say it,
but the vents?

23:50.930 --> 23:53.891
- No.
- You--you love vents.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.268
But you hate the vents.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.104
They're tiny and they're dusty,
and they make you all itchy.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.398
And they give you panic attacks.
That takes you days to calm down.

24:00.398 --> 24:01.732
What is going on?

24:01.732 --> 24:03.818
You know what else has dusty,
tiny little vents?

24:03.818 --> 24:05.027
Spaceships.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.029
Oh...

24:08.281 --> 24:11.159
I think it's time to
take Breanna off the bench.

24:11.868 --> 24:13.077
But she's on her date.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.336
- Set these...
- That looks delicious.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.673
So, do you, like, live here?

24:25.673 --> 24:29.927
Oh, no, no.
This is, uh, this is the family business.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.514
They're just pretty cool about
me using the courtyard for personal stuff.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.224
That's so sweet.
You work with your family.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.935
Yeah, yeah. They drive me crazy, but...

24:39.270 --> 24:40.479
Sorry.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.274
Oh. I--I forgot the hot sauce.

24:43.774 --> 24:44.942
Yeah, uh...

24:44.942 --> 24:47.111
Oh, boy. All right. Be right back. Sorry.

24:49.071 --> 24:49.989
Okay...

24:50.907 --> 24:53.993
Okay, what is going on?
And why did Parker text me

24:53.993 --> 24:55.453
"Hot soup space goggles"?

24:55.453 --> 24:57.163
<i>A code or something?</i>

24:57.163 --> 24:58.497
Thank you all very much.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.667
Now, we'll be stepping out
for a bit, but we won't be far.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.502
And we will always be
able to keep an eye on you.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.421
Wait, I--I have to--

25:07.924 --> 25:09.634
Something doesn't add up.

25:09.634 --> 25:13.387
This place is full of hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of art.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.598
So why the penny-ante holdup?

25:15.598 --> 25:18.017
Maybe because there's hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of art.

25:18.017 --> 25:20.853
While they're here robbing Nola's elite,

25:20.853 --> 25:22.730
nobody's checking the vaults.

25:23.814 --> 25:24.982
Bingo.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.612
Breanna, find out what the
most valuable items here are.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.698
So most of the stuff at the Freeport,
it does not have paperwork.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.451
<i>- That is kind of the point.</i>
- Try.

25:36.285 --> 25:39.413
The question is, is there an inside man?

25:39.413 --> 25:42.833
Well, the owner Don Farmingworth,
he did some business with my own firm.

25:42.833 --> 25:46.254
He took out massive loans
to finance this place.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.089
He might be overextended.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.425
You're about to find out.

25:53.678 --> 25:56.722
- Quite the party, Don.
- Harry Wilson.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.058
I haven't seen you since
your firm screwed me

25:59.058 --> 26:01.269
eight ways to Sunday on the Halsey deal.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.646
Well, that is why I left
and hung out my own

26:03.646 --> 26:04.855
Loyalty to clients.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.942
In fact, I have a client that's got
a collection he's looking to house.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.569
But I have to tell you, Don,
this whole heist thing is not a good look.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.779
Under normal circumstances,

26:11.779 --> 26:13.990
we're the best place
for your clients collection.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.158
A lot of clients sell to each other.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.035
Pieces don't even leave the Freeport.

26:18.494 --> 26:21.414
- Anonymous through LLCs.
- Mason!

26:23.874 --> 26:27.086
He's not here.
He's only eleven.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.629
He wandered off playing his game.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.590
Oh, my God. He's out there with them.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.846
Eliot, Mason's gone missing.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.014
All right, I'm on it.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.353
You know, I'm gonna give you some credit.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.231
Most of the times I knock people down,
they stay knocked down.

26:47.231 --> 26:48.816
Usually by choice.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.028
Seems like I'm holding my own.

27:06.792 --> 27:10.379
Okay, well.
Hey, little kid, you can't be down here.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.965
There's bad people running
around down here. Come with me.

27:16.719 --> 27:18.804
That's the bad guy, okay?
I'm the good guy.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.598
You don't look like a good guy.

27:20.598 --> 27:23.559
Yeah, well, we can discuss snap judgments
later, but right now, you're--

27:23.559 --> 27:24.769
Hey. Hey!

27:25.936 --> 27:27.480
I don't have time for this.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.410
Damn it, the kid's on the move.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.580
Hey. Hey, hey! Wake up.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.874
- How many guys on your team?
- Go to hell.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.919
Listen to me.
How many guys on your team?

27:50.878 --> 27:52.254
How many guys on your team?!

27:52.254 --> 27:54.173
- Five men.
- What's the mission?

27:54.173 --> 27:56.842
My job was to jump the guard
and throw the lockdown switch.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.719
We're supposed
to rendezvous at the loading dock.

28:03.099 --> 28:04.433
Okay, so when you think about it,

28:04.433 --> 28:07.019
the most valuable thing
in the building is Mason.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.854
<i>He's the only vault owner there</i>

28:08.854 --> 28:10.981
and the only person whose biometrics

28:10.981 --> 28:13.776
can open doors,
even if there is a lockdown.

28:14.485 --> 28:17.071
Oh, there you are.
What happened?

28:17.071 --> 28:20.324
Oh, yeah, speaking of family,
it's just family drama and stuff.

28:20.324 --> 28:21.909
They've been lighting up my phone.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.036
You were going to show
me pictures of your latest piece.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.872
The one that won the Rube Goldberg award.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.666
Yeah. Um...

28:30.501 --> 28:32.920
Mason left the party because of the game?

28:32.920 --> 28:33.879
He's obsessed with it.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.714
You collect these characters,

28:35.714 --> 28:38.259
and--and he must have seen
a rare one and went after it.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.010
Doesn't make any sense.

28:40.428 --> 28:41.762
Why does it make any sense?

28:41.762 --> 28:43.431
Uh--

28:43.431 --> 28:46.183
It doesn't make any sense
why I would grab these sauces

28:46.183 --> 28:49.019
and forget the side salad. Like,

28:49.019 --> 28:49.979
BRB.

28:51.272 --> 28:54.191
This--this game doesn't even
put spirits on private property.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.319
That's how they keep
players out of houses and businesses.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.281
<i>There should not be
any spirits at the Freeport.</i>

29:00.281 --> 29:02.616
We need to work the other guests.

29:02.616 --> 29:05.619
Breanna, pull up all the
info you can on everyone here.

29:10.416 --> 29:14.378
Didn't you tell me that each vault
has its own unique ventilation system?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.338
Yeah, but there's
no duct work between them.

29:16.338 --> 29:20.259
All right, but they all dump
out into the central H back room.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.094
Yeah. So...?

29:23.012 --> 29:25.389
So this is our escape.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.933
Uch! I can't believe we're on date night

29:27.933 --> 29:30.895
and all you can do is
talk about space, space, space.

29:32.021 --> 29:34.273
Sw-sweetie, talk to me.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.568
What's going on in the head of yours?

29:37.568 --> 29:39.278
I just don't know why you have to go.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.905
I don't know why it has to be you.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.073
Because it's me.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.910
The satellite system runs on a
programming language

29:45.910 --> 29:49.455
that I've been building for the
last year specifically for it,

29:49.455 --> 29:52.666
and no one else on the
planet can even read the code again.

29:52.666 --> 29:55.252
I have to go because there's only one me.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.588
Exactly. There's only one you.

29:59.673 --> 30:02.593
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

30:04.303 --> 30:05.346
Trust me.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.432
But we need to leave

30:08.432 --> 30:10.601
because I'm pretty sure
I saw something

30:10.601 --> 30:13.395
very large and ugly
crawling up the wall.

30:13.896 --> 30:16.482
Can't identify it. A lot of legs.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.487
Okay, fine. I'll do the vents.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.447
I'm not going to enjoy it.

30:39.630 --> 30:41.048
Oh, there's some feet.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.883
There's no dust mites in here.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.301
Yeah!

30:53.978 --> 30:56.814
Who the hell locks the
doors in the ventilation room? Who?!

30:56.814 --> 30:58.649
It's just a baby lock.
It's easy peasy.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.068
Hey, let me out!

31:01.652 --> 31:03.404
They locked me in here!

31:03.404 --> 31:05.531
Did they just lock a kid
inside that vault?

31:11.537 --> 31:13.497
Hey, let me out!

31:13.497 --> 31:14.957
Let's go get him.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.500
Through here?

31:16.500 --> 31:19.253
What--what, back through the tiny-ass vent
to the vault with locks?

31:19.253 --> 31:20.546
Oh, no, he good. He fine.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.339
There's a biometrics
panel inside the vault in case

31:22.339 --> 31:23.882
the owner accidentally gets trapped.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.217
You stay here, pick that lock,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.636
I go in the vent, Mason gets us out.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.637
Easy peasy.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.181
Parker, love of my life,

31:31.181 --> 31:34.268
I'm begging you.
Please stop saying "easy peasy."

31:34.268 --> 31:36.645
Okay? [stammers] None of this is easy.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.606
And I don't even know what peasy is.

31:39.273 --> 31:40.482
There's another layer.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.322
I believe you chose another future.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.823
How did you say to pick the lock?

31:47.823 --> 31:50.826
That-- Okay, cool.
You said the left one?

31:50.826 --> 31:52.244
I gotta go two to the right?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.788
But the layers, though--
The layers, though. Can I--?

31:55.748 --> 31:57.541
Wait. The--the layers.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.751
Go.

31:58.751 --> 31:59.835
- But the--
- Go.

32:00.294 --> 32:01.170
I see...

32:02.504 --> 32:03.464
Layers.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.133
Hey, hey! Let me out!

32:07.676 --> 32:10.054
- Ahh!
- It's okay. I'm a good guy.

32:10.054 --> 32:11.555
That's what the other guy said.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.559
The other guy was a good guy.
He just gets a little grumpy.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.227
The bad guys are
the ones who locked you in here.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.355
We hate those guys.
What happened to the head?

32:19.730 --> 32:22.691
The bad guys who
threw me in here, they took it.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.902
It's okay.
My friends and I, we're here to help.

32:24.902 --> 32:27.321
Originally, we came to
break into your grandma's place

32:27.321 --> 32:29.698
and play with her stuff--
mm, but now...

32:30.824 --> 32:32.368
The bad guys smashed it.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.454
Yeah, that's okay.
We can go out the way I came in.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.789
Come on.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.166
- Through the vents?
- Yeah, come on. It'll be fun.

32:41.335 --> 32:43.087
Oh.

32:43.921 --> 32:46.632
Hey... uh...

32:47.341 --> 32:49.343
It's going to be okay. Um...

32:50.260 --> 32:52.680
Honestly, my boyfriend
doesn't like the vents either.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.849
He gets kind of scared
and cries too, sometimes.

32:55.849 --> 32:59.770
Um, but honestly, it's just like a
big metal tube giving you a hug.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.730
Oh!

33:02.064 --> 33:03.732
I don't know what to do.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.818
I'm so scared.

33:05.818 --> 33:09.071
I need my grandma and she's not...

33:10.030 --> 33:12.491
You need her, and she can't get to you.

33:14.201 --> 33:15.160
Parker.

33:22.710 --> 33:25.838
You haven't had a lot of people in your
life who've stuck around, huh?

33:26.046 --> 33:27.673
Your grandma...

33:27.673 --> 33:29.925
She's the one who gave you a family,

33:29.925 --> 33:32.970
made you feel safe anywhere on the planet.

33:32.970 --> 33:37.725
She used to say,
"As long as I got you, you got me,

33:37.725 --> 33:39.059
we'll be okay."

33:39.059 --> 33:41.228
And now she's in a place
that's so far away

33:41.228 --> 33:43.439
that if you need her or
she needs you,

33:43.439 --> 33:44.857
you can't get to each other.

33:44.857 --> 33:45.899
Yeah.

33:46.483 --> 33:50.195
You know, I think you and I
are a little bit alike.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.573
We were both alone
in this world until we weren't.

33:52.573 --> 33:54.450
And I know that's really hard.

33:54.908 --> 33:57.327
But you're not alone right now.

33:58.787 --> 34:02.708
So... vents, please?

34:10.215 --> 34:13.260
Okay, so I have
the detail on everyone at the party.

34:13.260 --> 34:17.806
First, there is Kimberlee,
barista turned will executor,

34:17.806 --> 34:19.224
who you've already spoken to.

34:19.224 --> 34:22.060
And then next on our list
of potential inside men

34:22.060 --> 34:26.148
is Mitzy and Bitsy Lambert,
the hot sauce heiresses.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.233
- I do hope little Mason is okay.
- Oh.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.986
These things are usually so dull.

34:30.986 --> 34:33.572
Lillian knew how to bring the drama.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.534
Obviously that's why
Justin chose Lillian over you.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.704
Oh, Justin had a taste
for a sophisticated woman.

34:40.704 --> 34:43.165
He couldn't handle our spiciness.

34:43.165 --> 34:46.502
His loss. I would have made
sure he'd gotten enough in the will.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.669
What do you mean?

34:47.669 --> 34:52.591
Lillian's marriage contract payouts
were always based on how long they lasted.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.844
When she died, she and Justin
had been together for less than a year.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.680
So he only got a half million in the will.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.890
- Ah.
- Bright side,

34:59.890 --> 35:02.351
maybe he'll need a shoulder to cry on.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.066
No. I tried to advise Farmingworth

35:09.066 --> 35:11.276
since he is short on cash,
but he would not listen.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.402
You...

35:13.445 --> 35:15.072
You look like a savvy lady.

35:16.198 --> 35:18.867
You try cryptocurrency.

35:19.493 --> 35:20.619
I'm expert.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.831
Mm...

35:24.414 --> 35:25.833
<i>No prego.</i>

35:25.833 --> 35:27.835
<i>Giovanni Tosca,</i>

35:27.835 --> 35:31.380
<i>financial advisor to
the rich and gullible.</i>

35:31.380 --> 35:32.923
<i>He is not Italian.</i>

35:33.215 --> 35:36.260
So it turns out that Justin
put the moves on Mitzy

35:36.260 --> 35:39.471
before he married Lillian and
didn't get very much in the will.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.639
Mm. Plot thickens.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.016
And the fake Italian,
he just confirmed that

35:43.016 --> 35:44.935
Farmingworth's still overextended.

35:44.935 --> 35:46.436
Mm-hmm.

35:46.436 --> 35:49.523
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.816
We are--

35:50.816 --> 35:53.318
Jimmy's not at the meeting point. Over.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.821
He's not? That's not like him.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.750
Well, there goes our best suspect.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.294
That alarm is gonna call the police.

36:10.294 --> 36:11.837
No, no.
I need to find Mason!

36:13.255 --> 36:14.506
That goes our second best.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.009
Why would they put
Mason in the vault at all?

36:18.176 --> 36:19.261
Good question.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.763
The next person to talk gets shot.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.683
<i>Harry, Sophie, I'm coming to you.</i>

36:24.683 --> 36:26.268
I'm going to intercept
him at the loading dock.

36:26.268 --> 36:27.853
But this guy's getting way too antsy.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.104
I--I got you.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.772
<i>Go get our people.</i>

36:35.527 --> 36:37.571
Kind of got the hint
the second time you disappeared.

36:37.571 --> 36:40.449
No, no, no, this is--
it's--it's family stuff.

36:40.782 --> 36:42.159
What is it?

36:42.159 --> 36:45.746
I... can't tell you.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.289
Okay.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.541
I'm not--

36:50.000 --> 36:52.169
No, no, no. Come on.

36:54.338 --> 36:57.299
This is--this is not you. This is me.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.343
This is--

37:00.052 --> 37:03.847
Man, this is just how
my last relationship broke up.

37:04.848 --> 37:06.600
It--it was going great at first,

37:06.600 --> 37:09.394
and then she got
a super important tech job,

37:09.394 --> 37:12.773
and there was investors
and government security checks,

37:12.773 --> 37:14.983
and me and my family...

37:16.193 --> 37:18.111
we're just-- we're sketchy.

37:18.111 --> 37:21.156
And I did not want to risk her
losing her chance.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.700
So I stepped away.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.036
But you got to be there for family.

37:26.036 --> 37:28.080
My family kicked me out when I was twelve.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.415
So if your family loves you,

37:30.415 --> 37:34.002
go do your thing and call me tomorrow.

37:59.528 --> 38:00.737
Hey!

38:02.864 --> 38:03.782
Move!

38:03.782 --> 38:05.742
You know, I would love to, gentlemen,

38:05.742 --> 38:07.869
but I'm a little broken down right now.

38:09.121 --> 38:11.206
Actually-- would--
would you guys mind taking a look?

38:23.176 --> 38:25.929
Parker was right.
Tasing is fun.

38:32.728 --> 38:35.188
Guys, that dino head from Lillian's vault?

38:35.772 --> 38:37.024
Not here.

38:40.569 --> 38:42.112
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

38:42.112 --> 38:43.071
Stuck.

38:43.739 --> 38:44.823
Maybe you broke it.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.408
I didn't break it.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.201
You're not supposed to go through those.

38:52.748 --> 38:54.499
Mm-hmm. Mm.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.294
- What?
- Air is moving out.

38:57.294 --> 38:58.962
That's why it's stuck. Oh.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.298
- What?
- Nothing.

39:01.298 --> 39:04.259
I just think maybe pulling the
alarm trigger to fire suppression system,

39:04.259 --> 39:06.595
and now the oxygen is
slowly being sucked out of the room.

39:06.595 --> 39:07.971
But it's totally fine.

39:07.971 --> 39:11.058
"Fine"?
Aren't we gonna run out of air?

39:11.058 --> 39:13.018
Not... for a while.

39:15.562 --> 39:16.772
Yes!

39:19.900 --> 39:23.236
How long is a while?
What's a while of air?

39:23.236 --> 39:26.198
Um, well, uh, depending on

39:26.198 --> 39:29.451
the, uh, measurements
of the room and the speed of the airflow,

39:29.451 --> 39:31.244
eh, I don't know, like five minutes?

39:31.828 --> 39:33.663
That doesn't sound like a lot.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.208
Okay, Mason, I'm going to
need you to just stay calm, okay?

39:36.208 --> 39:38.168
The calmer you stay,
the less air you need.

39:38.168 --> 39:39.127
Okay?

39:39.669 --> 39:41.421
Did your grandma
bring you down here a lot?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.132
We'd bring a picnic and sit on the floor

39:44.132 --> 39:45.926
and she'd tell me about all the stuff.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.886
Oh, which piece is your favorite?

39:47.886 --> 39:51.264
- Dino head!
- Yeah, me, too.

39:51.264 --> 39:53.100
Um...

39:53.100 --> 39:55.310
I may need to borrow your shoelaces.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.479
Okay...

40:06.113 --> 40:07.864
I put the code in, but it won't open.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.701
The oxygen being sucked out
is creating a pressure differential.

40:11.701 --> 40:14.329
It sealed the door like a vacuum.

40:14.329 --> 40:17.666
I'm gonna go back to the ventilation
room and try to hack the system.

40:17.666 --> 40:20.335
Parker, you need to find a way
to break the pressure seal.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.254
- We need chemicals.
- What?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.506
We have to create a
flash chemical reaction along the doors.

40:24.506 --> 40:26.633
It seemed to break
the pressure holding it closed.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.135
We need to blow it up.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.846
Oh. There might be
some stuff in this tool bag.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.265
What's polymerism?

40:33.265 --> 40:36.476
Ooh, it's like a fuse.
But we need something to light it with.

40:36.476 --> 40:37.936
Tie those together.

40:41.982 --> 40:46.236
You don't happen to know
where any oil or alcohol is?

40:46.236 --> 40:48.321
- Do you?
- Uh, Grandma's secret flask.

40:48.321 --> 40:49.656
When we came in for our picnics,

40:49.656 --> 40:51.324
she used to sneak drinks from it.

40:51.324 --> 40:52.284
It's in the--

40:54.578 --> 40:56.663
The drawer <i>under</i> the statue.

40:56.663 --> 40:58.039
She said it got the party started.

40:58.039 --> 40:59.249
Oh.

41:01.543 --> 41:03.837
I like Grandma.
Give me those shoelaces.

41:08.717 --> 41:09.759
There we go.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.469
Then this...

41:13.096 --> 41:15.307
Wouldn't an explosion use up more oxygen?

41:15.307 --> 41:18.768
You're a pretty impressive kid,
you know that?

41:18.768 --> 41:19.895
Huh.

41:19.895 --> 41:21.313
Probably don't think about this too much.

41:26.401 --> 41:27.944
At least if I die,

41:27.944 --> 41:29.196
I get to see my grandma again.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.239
A, you're not gonna die.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.574
B...

41:33.575 --> 41:34.492
Here.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.412
You see this? It's pretty, right?

41:37.412 --> 41:38.455
It's just time.

41:39.039 --> 41:41.499
Love's not about how much
time you spend with someone.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.293
<i>It's about who you are
when you're together.</i>

41:44.002 --> 41:47.380
And the cool thing is that no
matter how much time passes,

41:47.380 --> 41:51.718
it's just... it's something you always
get to keep with you. Okay?

41:52.928 --> 41:56.056
Parker, I'm not going to
be able to stop the airflow.

41:56.056 --> 41:57.390
Yep, we got it.

41:57.390 --> 41:58.642
Go behind the pallets.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.357
Um, are you sure about this?

42:05.357 --> 42:07.317
Let's get this party started.

42:11.780 --> 42:15.158
Carl, come in.
Lou, come in.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.661
Carl. Lou.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.579
The boy is gonna die.

42:19.579 --> 42:22.207
Your men locked that boy in the vault.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.252
Now, because of the fire alarm,
the air is being sucked out.

42:25.252 --> 42:28.713
A child will die today,
and it will be your fault.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.216
And the men who paid you,
they'll just walk away.

42:37.681 --> 42:39.015
What the hell did you do to my men?

42:45.313 --> 42:46.940
What the hell did you do to my men?

42:49.567 --> 42:50.527
Yo.

42:52.362 --> 42:54.572
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.283
Mason.

42:56.283 --> 42:57.492
Mason?!

42:59.119 --> 43:01.788
Hardison, do you have Parker?

43:01.788 --> 43:05.542
Mason? Mason!

43:05.542 --> 43:07.794
What? What is this doing here?

43:07.794 --> 43:08.962
Looking for me?

43:10.380 --> 43:11.881
Oh, thank God.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.304
How did you know
that Mason was in the vault?

43:17.304 --> 43:21.182
I, uh-- the game.
I--I--I have the game on my phone

43:21.182 --> 43:24.728
so I can find him when he wanders off
in search of a spirit.

43:24.728 --> 43:25.937
But you didn't have your phone.

43:25.937 --> 43:29.107
And the spirits
don't appear on private property.

43:29.107 --> 43:30.900
You know, Sophie,
the only way for a spirit

43:30.900 --> 43:32.652
to end up in the vault in the first place

43:32.652 --> 43:35.030
is if someone hacks
Mason's phone to put it there.

43:35.030 --> 43:36.364
Someone close.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.491
Close enough to
know it would lure him there.

43:38.491 --> 43:42.620
It was a bit of a mystery
because Farmingworth pulled the alarm.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.748
He doesn't have a reason to kill Mason.

43:44.748 --> 43:48.585
He did have a motive to
facilitate a robbery, though. Money.

43:48.585 --> 43:53.882
So if you asked him to pull
the alarm just as a final distraction,

43:53.882 --> 43:56.217
without telling him that
Mason was in the vault.

43:56.217 --> 43:57.719
Why would I want to hurt Mason?

43:57.719 --> 43:59.137
Oh, that's an excellent question.

43:59.137 --> 44:01.514
Mason doesn't have a will,
and you're not a blood relation,

44:01.514 --> 44:03.266
so you don't stand to inherit anything.

44:03.266 --> 44:07.312
Then my friend here remembered
what Kimberlee, Lillian's executor, said.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.106
Any questions before you
take your exam to give me a call.

44:10.106 --> 44:13.068
Thanks. Survivor clauses
have my head spinning.

44:13.068 --> 44:16.404
Survivor's Clause stipulates
that the primary heir

44:16.404 --> 44:19.949
has to outlive the decedent
by 30 days in order to inherit.

44:19.949 --> 44:21.117
Lillian had one.

44:21.117 --> 44:24.037
Now, if Mason were to die
before those 30 days were up,

44:24.037 --> 44:26.790
the entire state would go
to the next heir in the will. You.

44:26.790 --> 44:29.667
And that gave us motive--
Icky, icky motive--

44:29.667 --> 44:31.002
but we still had questions.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.462
What happened to the dino head?

44:32.462 --> 44:34.506
Why would those
guys want to take it in the first place?

44:34.506 --> 44:37.675
Don't you just hate it when
you got a private Freeport owner

44:37.675 --> 44:38.760
and the mercenaries,

44:38.760 --> 44:40.804
but you just don't have
the working capital?

44:40.804 --> 44:42.680
I mean, what was your take from the will?

44:42.680 --> 44:44.474
Half a mill? That's not gonna cut it.

44:44.474 --> 44:48.561
So why not have
the mercenaries steal something

44:48.561 --> 44:51.856
and then pay them off with the proceeds?

44:51.856 --> 44:54.484
The Waldman.
That's perfect.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.154
You wanted them
to steal the Waldman painting.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.448
But after we had it moved,

45:00.448 --> 45:02.742
the only thing
of similar value in the vault

45:02.742 --> 45:03.993
was the dinosaur skull.

45:03.993 --> 45:05.912
Must have been hard to make it disappear.

45:05.912 --> 45:07.122
Or was it?

45:07.122 --> 45:08.832
A lot of clients sell to each other.

45:08.832 --> 45:10.333
Pieces don't even leave the Freeport.

45:10.333 --> 45:13.002
Anonymous through LLCs.

45:13.670 --> 45:15.797
Wouldn't be hard
to move a head between vaults,

45:15.797 --> 45:17.715
so we checked the records.

45:17.715 --> 45:20.927
Oh, an LLC just rented
a vault two doors down.

45:20.927 --> 45:22.595
At twice the normal rate.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.347
I have to admit,
it was a clever way

45:24.347 --> 45:26.224
to conceal a payoff to Farmingworth.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.643
So what? So some anonymous
LLC renting a vault.

45:28.643 --> 45:30.145
Th-that could have been anyone.

45:30.145 --> 45:31.855
Didn't we mention that that LLC--

45:31.855 --> 45:33.898
that new LLC was opened up with

45:33.898 --> 45:35.650
a very unique amount of money.

45:35.650 --> 45:37.318
It was, uh, what was it?
About half a mil?

45:37.318 --> 45:38.278
Oh!

45:38.278 --> 45:39.487
And when Farmingworth and Nick wake up

45:39.487 --> 45:41.406
to learn that you were
going to murder Mason

45:41.406 --> 45:42.532
and leave them holding the bag,

45:42.532 --> 45:44.409
ooh, I bet they're
going to get real chatty.

45:44.409 --> 45:46.494
How did you get the head back?

45:46.494 --> 45:48.204
See, it's Bad Guy 101.

45:48.204 --> 45:50.915
When you get a shiny, brand new vault,

45:50.915 --> 45:52.750
change the default password.

45:55.003 --> 45:56.379
Whee!

45:58.214 --> 45:59.340
It's just the basics.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.383
- Basics.
- Basics.

46:00.383 --> 46:03.344
We could have left the
dinosaur head in the vault.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.138
I mean, it is evidence against you.

46:05.138 --> 46:08.725
But once we had you on
attempted murder of a child,

46:08.725 --> 46:10.310
it seemed rather gilding the lily.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.479
Besides, it's Mason's favorite.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.858
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you doing?

46:16.858 --> 46:20.653
Don't worry. The police are on their way,
and there's plenty of air.

46:20.653 --> 46:23.990
No! You can't leave me in here.

46:24.616 --> 46:26.034
I can't breathe!

46:26.034 --> 46:27.744
No! Get me out!

46:27.744 --> 46:29.245
I have asthma!

46:29.245 --> 46:30.330
Stop!

46:32.207 --> 46:34.876
Well, I got Farmingworth and
Nick and a couple of their mercs

46:34.876 --> 46:36.419
tussled up like Christmas presents.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.841
Oh, uh, if nobody minds,

46:41.841 --> 46:44.010
I think I might grab a late-night drink,

46:44.886 --> 46:48.223
Especially since I got a sweet
new truck to take her out in.

46:48.223 --> 46:51.851
Hey. Hey.
You took-- you <i>stole</i> my truck?

46:52.810 --> 46:53.895
Damn it.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.605
Hardison,

46:55.605 --> 46:58.483
if I'm gonna get
kicked and punched on your date...

46:59.484 --> 47:00.818
then don't waste it.

47:04.864 --> 47:07.784
What do you say we all
head back to HQ and order some food?

47:07.784 --> 47:09.452
I'm starving.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.996
But nothing will be open this late.

47:12.622 --> 47:13.623
I'm--

47:13.623 --> 47:14.874
Hmm?

47:14.874 --> 47:16.584
I worked alone for years.

47:16.584 --> 47:18.461
- Oh, yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.
- Years.

47:18.461 --> 47:20.046
- Yes, Chef.
- You're not helping.

47:20.505 --> 47:21.798
Just a little appetizer.

47:22.590 --> 47:25.218
Well, I did want tonight to be memorable.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.762
What's going to happen to Mason?

47:27.762 --> 47:30.723
Uh, yeah, he's rich,
but he's all alone now.

47:30.723 --> 47:33.059
Social services is [indistinct].

47:33.059 --> 47:35.019
And I made a call.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.730
Mason may have lost a grandma,

47:37.730 --> 47:41.317
but there's a good chance
he might just gain a nana.

47:41.943 --> 47:43.861
And he gave me this.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.491
I don't want you to go to space.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.034
I mean, I want you to go to space.

47:50.034 --> 47:52.412
But what if you need me?

47:52.412 --> 47:54.247
Babe, I always need you.

47:54.247 --> 47:56.082
Which is why I'm saying
I should go with you.

47:56.082 --> 47:57.917
I'm small, I can fit in your spacesuit.

47:57.917 --> 48:00.044
Or I can have Breanna
start working on trajectories

48:00.044 --> 48:01.796
- so they intercept your satellite.
- Babe. Babe. Babe.

48:02.839 --> 48:04.632
The idea of me being further away from you

48:04.632 --> 48:06.175
than I already have been is...

48:07.969 --> 48:11.389
Look, what tonight taught me,
what it made me realize is that

48:12.098 --> 48:14.475
we don't need date nights to be together.

48:14.475 --> 48:16.352
We don't even need to be
on the same planet.

48:16.352 --> 48:18.313
We are Parker and Hardison.

48:18.313 --> 48:19.981
<i>Pardison.</i>

48:19.981 --> 48:21.816
Always and anywhere.

48:22.525 --> 48:24.527
Time and space mean nothing to us.

48:25.194 --> 48:26.821
We're like the Doctor.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.781
We're like two Doctors.

48:28.781 --> 48:31.242
Like a Christmas special
with multiple Doctors.

48:33.786 --> 48:34.996
Yes, we are.

48:39.459 --> 48:40.335
Okay.

48:40.335 --> 48:42.754
But next date night,
let's just stick to jumping off buildings

48:42.754 --> 48:44.422
because tonight was a lot.

48:44.422 --> 48:45.965
Yes. Thank you!

48:45.965 --> 48:48.718
Wait. No! Uh-- Wait.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.264
All right. It's crazy. Whatever.

49:37.684 --> 49:38.643
What can I help you with?

49:38.643 --> 49:41.979
Help me prove
the explosion wasn't an accident.

49:42.939 --> 49:44.941
<i>Paul was killed by Austin Kirlander.</i>

49:44.941 --> 49:47.276
He founded Silvergard,
which is a shady ass--

49:47.276 --> 49:50.405
Largest private security
companies in operation today.

49:50.405 --> 49:53.366
Sounded like Kirlander had a secret
and Paul found out what it was.

49:53.366 --> 49:58.621
Stand by. I'm jamming those
infrared sensors all while microwaving...

49:59.080 --> 50:00.498
a bean and cheese burrito.

50:05.545 --> 50:06.546
Don't!
