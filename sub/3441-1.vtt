She's coming closer, Daddy.

03:58.451 --> 04:01.477

04:01.521 --> 04:02.852
Daddy?

04:02.889 --> 04:04.220

04:12.432 --> 04:13.524
- She's here.
She's here.

04:13.567 --> 04:14.693
She's here.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.794
l'm sorry.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.713
Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Matthew!

06:09.749 --> 06:13.685
- So you want
to hear a ghost story?

06:15.221 --> 06:20.989
Well, every ghost story
begins With a house...

06:23.763 --> 06:25.958
and a tragedy.

06:28.702 --> 06:32.035
And so We begin With mine.

06:36.142 --> 06:37.769
Moving into that house

06:37.811 --> 06:39.972
Was supposed to be
a neW beginning

06:40.013 --> 06:42.243
for me, Franklin,
and the kids.

06:45.018 --> 06:47.680
l Was a pediatrician,

06:47.721 --> 06:50.053
Franklin, a dentist.

06:51.391 --> 06:54.554
We even built
our practices there.

06:57.263 --> 07:00.699
But after it started
to happen...

07:02.469 --> 07:05.370
- Business dropped off.

07:06.906 --> 07:11.570
After all, What good's
a pediatrician

07:11.611 --> 07:14.637
Who can't keep
her own babies alive?

07:15.682 --> 07:17.013
- 911.
What's your emergency?

07:17.050 --> 07:18.381
- Oh, my God!

07:18.418 --> 07:19.578
- What just happened?

07:19.619 --> 07:21.052
Tell me what happened.

07:21.087 --> 07:23.078
- Headstrong MattheW...

07:25.458 --> 07:27.153
little Hilary...

07:30.063 --> 07:33.032
and our free spirit,
Kate.

07:37.203 --> 07:39.763
Call it a wretched twist
of fate.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.467
Call it the Wrath of God.

07:41.508 --> 07:43.874
l don't care What you name it.

07:43.910 --> 07:46.970
All l know is,
it took them.

07:47.013 --> 07:49.413
lt took each
and every one of them.

07:50.483 --> 07:53.213
People around here
had a name for it.

07:53.253 --> 07:56.882
They called it
''The Morello Curse. ''

07:56.923 --> 07:59.949
l heard them whispering
after Hilary Went.

08:02.829 --> 08:07.323
But by the time Franklin took
his tumble and left me alone,

08:07.367 --> 08:09.198
the whispers stopped.

08:11.471 --> 08:15.965
The silence had a voice,
and it said,

08:16.009 --> 08:20.446
''There but for the grace
of God go l. ''

08:24.417 --> 08:28.581
-  KRB 94.1

08:28.621 --> 08:31.954
- Current weather for the region
looking like snow.

08:31.991 --> 08:34.357
- Oan somebody please
change the station?

08:34.394 --> 08:36.919
- Yeah, we're not gonna pick up
much out here, honey.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.299
- Dad, seriously.
Where is this place?

08:43.336 --> 08:44.701
- He's lost.
- l am not lost.

08:44.737 --> 08:45.726
- Honey, you're lost.

08:45.772 --> 08:46.796
- No, l'm just trying-

08:46.840 --> 08:48.000
- You're lost.
Admit it.

08:48.041 --> 08:50.100
- l'm just trying to find
the turnoff where we have to go.

08:50.143 --> 08:51.132
- He's lost.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.673
- Yep, l'm lost.

08:57.617 --> 08:58.606
Wait.

08:58.651 --> 09:00.983
l actually think
this is it right here.

09:17.437 --> 09:19.928
- And you must be the Ashers.

09:19.973 --> 09:20.997
l'm glad you could make it.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.166
lt's nice to finally meet you.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.197
- Nice to meet you.

09:23.243 --> 09:24.267
- How you doing?
- Good.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.210
You're gonna love the place.
Oome on in.

09:34.821 --> 09:37.949
Go ahead and show
yourselves around.

11:24.831 --> 11:26.264
- Evan?

11:33.206 --> 11:35.902
So what do you think?

11:35.942 --> 11:37.239
- Of the attic?

11:37.276 --> 11:38.641
No.

11:38.678 --> 11:39.804
Of the house.

11:39.846 --> 11:40.904
- lt's big.

11:40.947 --> 11:42.278
- Yeah.

11:42.315 --> 11:43.907
There's a pool out back.

11:43.950 --> 11:46.510
l mean, it's kind of shabby,
but it's pretty nice.

11:46.552 --> 11:48.247
- lt's a little creepy,
though.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.380
- just needs some moving into.

11:50.423 --> 11:52.084
You know, there's
a master bedroom downstairs

11:52.125 --> 11:53.922
with a sick bathroom
and a balcony.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.293
So l highly doubt Mom and Dad
will be considering this room,

11:57.330 --> 11:58.797
which means it's up for grabs.

11:58.831 --> 12:01.129
- Shouldn't l be the one getting
something in exchange

12:01.167 --> 12:02.930
for all this
getting uprooted business?

12:02.969 --> 12:04.800
l mean, you can
come and go as you please.

12:04.837 --> 12:06.737
l, on the other hand,
am stuck here.

12:06.773 --> 12:08.832
- Oh, poor Evan.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.606
Has to live in a big house
with a pool in the backyard.

12:12.645 --> 12:14.738
You could have
some seriously big

12:14.781 --> 12:16.612
game-changing parties here,
little brother.

12:16.649 --> 12:18.241
Shit!

12:18.284 --> 12:19.273
- What?

12:21.721 --> 12:23.211
- What kind of people
leave something like that

12:23.256 --> 12:25.224
just sitting there?

12:26.659 --> 12:28.286
- Jeez.

12:28.327 --> 12:30.852
Looks like that kid who died
in that car accident.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.362
- You know what?

12:35.401 --> 12:36.732
You can have it.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.703
- Take your time,
talk it over,

12:42.742 --> 12:44.607
and l'll be waiting
right outside.

12:44.644 --> 12:45.770
- Yeah.

12:48.381 --> 12:50.645
- So what do we think?

12:50.683 --> 12:52.583
- lt's pretty great.

12:52.618 --> 12:54.415
- But...

12:54.454 --> 12:55.978
- lt's kind of creepy.

12:56.022 --> 12:58.991
- You're just thinking too much
about the last family.

12:59.025 --> 13:01.152
- What happened
to the last family?

13:02.228 --> 13:04.594
- Nothing. They just-
They had to move out.

13:04.630 --> 13:06.655
- l mean, the place
needs some fixing up,

13:06.699 --> 13:08.291
and, yeah,
there's some weird stuff.

13:08.334 --> 13:10.734
But l like it.

13:10.770 --> 13:12.328
- l love it.

13:12.371 --> 13:15.431
So you think we can live here?

13:18.311 --> 13:21.109
- Yeah.
l guess we could.

13:38.231 --> 13:39.323
Thanks.

13:44.637 --> 13:45.626
- Yeah.

13:45.671 --> 13:47.730
- Yeah.
Let's see.

13:47.773 --> 13:49.138
- This could be
in the dining room.

13:49.175 --> 13:50.164
- Oh, l like this one.

13:50.209 --> 13:51.198
- l love it.

13:51.244 --> 13:52.233
- Yeah.

13:56.849 --> 13:59.215
ls that her?

13:59.252 --> 14:00.651
- ls that who?

14:00.686 --> 14:02.483
Oh, yeah.

14:03.756 --> 14:05.917
That's her.

14:05.958 --> 14:07.721
l wonder what she's doing here.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.022
We should go say hi.

14:09.061 --> 14:12.360
- Oh, l don't want any
of her iuiu rubbing off on me.

14:12.398 --> 14:14.332
- Alan.
All right, tough guy.

14:14.367 --> 14:15.994
l, for one, am immune to iuiu.

14:16.035 --> 14:18.435
- Uh-huh, sure, you are.
Famous last words.

14:18.471 --> 14:19.460
- Shh.

14:21.007 --> 14:23.532
Dr. Morello?

14:23.576 --> 14:25.100
- Mrs. Asher?

14:25.144 --> 14:26.907
- Oh, call me Emily.

14:26.946 --> 14:29.244
- Of course.
Oall me ianet.

14:29.282 --> 14:31.079
l don't want to intrude.

14:31.117 --> 14:34.211
lt's just that
l left something behind.

14:34.253 --> 14:35.242
Do you mind?

14:35.288 --> 14:37.654
- No, of course not.
Do you know where it is?

14:37.690 --> 14:40.750
- l do.
Thank you, Emily.

14:46.966 --> 14:48.160
- Thanks.

15:30.109 --> 15:32.100
- Can l help you?

15:32.144 --> 15:34.135
- Oh, hello there.

15:34.180 --> 15:36.239

15:36.282 --> 15:37.772
l used to live here.

15:37.817 --> 15:40.377
- Oh, hi.

15:40.419 --> 15:42.546
- l remembered
l left something here.

15:42.588 --> 15:45.819
l don't want it
to get thrown away.

15:45.858 --> 15:47.052
- The portrait?

15:47.093 --> 15:49.721
- My son's portrait.

15:49.762 --> 15:51.787
You didn't throw it away,
did you?

15:51.831 --> 15:52.820
- No.

15:52.865 --> 15:54.890
No, of-of course not.

15:54.934 --> 15:56.902
Good.

16:00.373 --> 16:01.965
There you are.

16:06.145 --> 16:07.339
Right where you left him.

16:14.220 --> 16:18.020
- How old are you?
18?

16:18.057 --> 16:19.354
Yeah.

16:19.392 --> 16:22.884
He was your age when he died.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.889
This is his room.

16:31.637 --> 16:33.002
Thank you.

16:36.976 --> 16:37.965
- Bye.

16:53.492 --> 16:55.619
- Did you find
what you were looking for?

16:55.661 --> 16:56.787
- Yes.

16:56.829 --> 16:58.854
- Good. Good.

16:58.898 --> 17:01.731
- l apologize.

17:01.767 --> 17:02.791
- For what?

17:02.835 --> 17:04.665
- lf l seem sullen.

17:04.704 --> 17:06.865
- Oh, don't be silly.

17:06.906 --> 17:09.965
These transitions can be hard.

17:10.009 --> 17:13.137
- l've had a hard time,
Emily.

17:13.179 --> 17:14.441
- l know.

17:15.948 --> 17:17.108
- Hey, Mom!

17:17.148 --> 17:19.674
The closet door's locked.

17:19.719 --> 17:21.686
Do you have the key to open it?

17:21.721 --> 17:23.655
- One second, Sarah!

17:25.358 --> 17:26.723
l'm so sorry.

17:26.759 --> 17:29.227
Those kids,
they're really spoiled.

17:29.261 --> 17:31.229
- l say go ahead
and spoil them.

17:31.263 --> 17:34.596
- lt's too late
for anything else, l think.

17:34.633 --> 17:36.999
Well, it was nice
to officially meet you.

17:37.036 --> 17:38.901
- The pleasure was mine.

17:38.938 --> 17:41.031
You're very kind, Emily.

17:41.073 --> 17:43.803
Now, you go spoil
those kids of yours.

17:43.843 --> 17:45.606
- Okay. l will.

17:53.552 --> 17:55.179
- Okay. Dig in.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.155
- Oh, wait.
Hold on. Hold on.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.626
l-l'd like to propose
a toast.

18:04.463 --> 18:06.795
At times like these,
l think it's important

18:06.832 --> 18:09.096
to stop and look around

18:09.135 --> 18:11.865
and appreciate
how lucky we are.

18:11.904 --> 18:14.839
l can't think of anything better
than-than being with my family

18:14.874 --> 18:18.537
on a beautiful night
in the first week

18:18.577 --> 18:19.737
of our new house!

18:19.779 --> 18:21.007
- Hear! Hear!
- Oheers!

18:21.046 --> 18:22.240
- Oheers!
- Oheers!

18:22.281 --> 18:24.476
Oh, yeah. just like l...

18:25.718 --> 18:27.151
Did you order the pizza
with everything?

18:36.295 --> 18:37.956
- Where do you think
you're going?

18:37.997 --> 18:39.487
- Don't touch me!

18:39.532 --> 18:41.659
- Think you can just run
out of here like your mother?

18:41.700 --> 18:42.758
Dad, no!

18:55.681 --> 18:57.410
- l think he's having
some problems, Ron.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.439
l don't know what,

18:58.484 --> 19:00.384
if it's a hit selection
or what, but...

19:00.419 --> 19:02.011
- He knows he's ready.

19:02.054 --> 19:03.351
The 3-and-2 pitch...

19:03.389 --> 19:04.481
- You know, look.

19:04.523 --> 19:05.854
Do l think he's, like,
a troubled teenager?

19:05.891 --> 19:07.153
No.

19:07.193 --> 19:08.854
But l think this move
is good for him.

19:08.894 --> 19:10.486
- Because...

19:10.529 --> 19:12.463
- Because as hard as it seems
for him right now,

19:12.498 --> 19:14.489
long-term,
l just think it's...

19:14.533 --> 19:16.091
l just think it's best.

19:17.436 --> 19:18.528
lt's hard for him.

19:18.571 --> 19:20.004
- Now, l know he had to leave
his friends.

19:20.039 --> 19:21.597
l know that was hard.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.664
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.708 --> 19:25.973
- But maybe a fresh start
will be-

19:26.011 --> 19:27.410
will be good for him.

19:29.215 --> 19:31.308
- Hey.
Where are you off to?

19:31.350 --> 19:33.784
- l'm going for a walk.

19:33.819 --> 19:35.650
- You okay?

19:35.688 --> 19:37.553
Yeah, l'm fine.

20:32.411 --> 20:33.537
- You all right?

20:36.115 --> 20:37.582
- Hey, l'm-l'm sorry.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.277
l didn't mean to scare you.

20:42.755 --> 20:44.620
- Who are you?

20:44.657 --> 20:45.783
- Evan.

20:45.824 --> 20:47.758
l'm Evan.

20:49.762 --> 20:51.627
- What are you doing here?

20:53.365 --> 20:55.196
- l live in that house.

20:56.502 --> 20:57.969
We just moved in.

20:59.171 --> 21:00.900
- That's the Morello house.

21:02.274 --> 21:04.139
lt's cursed.

21:04.176 --> 21:06.406
- Oh.

21:06.645 --> 21:07.976
Great.

21:09.114 --> 21:12.675
- l...have been
in that house.

21:17.089 --> 21:20.456
- Yeah, well,
now l live there.

21:24.163 --> 21:25.960
- l'm Sam.

21:33.505 --> 21:35.837
- Why are you crying, Sam?

21:37.209 --> 21:38.904
- lt's none of your business.

21:40.746 --> 21:42.680
- Are you okay?

21:46.151 --> 21:48.016
- l don't like that question.

21:50.255 --> 21:51.347
- Why?

21:51.390 --> 21:53.358
- Because it's empty.

21:53.392 --> 21:54.450
lt's rhetorical.

21:54.493 --> 21:56.757
Does it really make a difference
if l say yes or no?

21:57.730 --> 21:59.197
- Well, it might.

21:59.231 --> 22:00.926
- How so?

22:02.201 --> 22:04.465
- Because if-if you need help,
maybe l can help you.

22:04.503 --> 22:06.733
- You know what you are?

22:06.772 --> 22:08.797
You're a romantic.

22:08.841 --> 22:10.866
You stumble upon a girl
crying in the woods,

22:10.909 --> 22:13.434
and now you want
to rescue her.

22:15.714 --> 22:17.841
- Do you need rescuing?

22:17.883 --> 22:20.078
- No.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.916
l don't.

22:21.954 --> 22:24.286
Thanks
but no, thanks.

22:27.192 --> 22:28.352
- Okay.

22:32.031 --> 22:33.521
- Hey, wait.

22:41.340 --> 22:42.898
Thanks.

23:09.435 --> 23:11.266
Really?

23:13.038 --> 23:14.733
Mom?

23:17.943 --> 23:19.501
Dad?

23:22.347 --> 23:24.178
ls anyone home?

25:19.932 --> 25:22.662
- No! No!

25:24.236 --> 25:26.033
No! Leave me alone!

25:28.707 --> 25:30.368
No! No!

25:30.409 --> 25:32.343
Stop! No!

25:32.377 --> 25:34.140
No!

25:36.448 --> 25:38.109
- We'll see, when they
come begging me

25:38.150 --> 25:40.311
to let them in down here.

25:40.352 --> 25:41.842
- That's important,
isn't it?

25:41.887 --> 25:42.876
- What?

25:42.921 --> 25:44.650
- To be right,
everybody else to be wrong.

25:44.690 --> 25:46.157
- What do you mean by that?

25:51.530 --> 25:53.395
Anita.

25:58.070 --> 25:59.401
Anita?

26:15.454 --> 26:17.319
- Get out, Dad! Get out!
- Where were you last night?

26:17.356 --> 26:18.687
- Nowhere! l was nowhere!

26:18.724 --> 26:20.589
- Where were you last night?

26:20.626 --> 26:22.457
- Get out of my room!

28:16.775 --> 28:18.606
How did you get in here?

28:20.278 --> 28:23.179
- l told you.
l've been in this house before.

28:27.586 --> 28:29.053
- Are you freaked out?

28:31.623 --> 28:32.920
- No.

28:34.192 --> 28:35.853
- Do you want me to go?

28:41.299 --> 28:42.766
Okay.

29:06.625 --> 29:08.593
- What can l do?

29:12.964 --> 29:14.864
Protect me.

29:18.670 --> 29:20.103
- l will.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.367
- You promise?

29:26.478 --> 29:28.173
- l-l promise.

30:23.735 --> 30:27.637
- Do you gobble up
all your fingers?

30:30.008 --> 30:32.772
- You have got yourself
one healthy baby.

30:32.811 --> 30:34.574
Everything's tip-top.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.638
- What about all the crying?

30:36.681 --> 30:39.673
- Oh, that's just
her teeth coming in.

30:39.718 --> 30:41.276
Perfectly normal.

30:41.319 --> 30:44.652
Get some teething gel
from the pharmacy.

30:44.689 --> 30:47.157
- Well, thank you,
Dr. Morello.

30:47.192 --> 30:49.160
- You're welcome.

30:51.129 --> 30:53.359
- Hmm.

30:53.398 --> 30:54.888
- Once she gets her teeth,

30:54.933 --> 30:57.868
you must bring her
to see my husband.

31:00.005 --> 31:02.439
- How's his office coming along?

31:02.474 --> 31:05.739
- Oh, just getting started,
but it won't be long.

31:05.777 --> 31:08.337
Pretty soon,
we'll be a one-stop shop.

31:09.247 --> 31:10.737
- That's great.

31:12.918 --> 31:13.942
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:13.985 --> 31:16.385
- Oh, hush. Hush.

32:30.228 --> 32:31.695
- Who are you?

32:32.831 --> 32:34.924
- l'm Sam.
Who are you?

32:35.800 --> 32:36.789
- Anita.

32:36.835 --> 32:39.099
- lt's nice to meet you,
Anita.

32:39.137 --> 32:40.126
- Nice to meet you.

32:43.675 --> 32:45.438
Anita?

32:45.477 --> 32:47.411
- Oh, Mom wants you.

32:47.445 --> 32:48.969
Okay.

32:59.624 --> 33:02.354
- Everyone,
this is Sam.

33:02.394 --> 33:03.827
Sam, this is everyone.

33:03.862 --> 33:05.591
- lt's nice to meet you,
everyone.

33:05.630 --> 33:08.224
- Evan didn't tell me
he was having a friend over.

33:08.266 --> 33:10.166
- No, l'm really sorry.

33:10.201 --> 33:12.066
l meant to be out early.

33:12.103 --> 33:13.536
l should probably go.

33:14.773 --> 33:15.797
- Nice to meet you, Sam.

33:15.840 --> 33:16.829
- Likewise.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.740
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:18.777 --> 33:20.210
- Yeah, l got
to get going too.

33:20.245 --> 33:22.270
l got to do rounds
at the hospital.

33:23.481 --> 33:25.039
Let's talk about that later?

33:25.083 --> 33:26.516
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

33:26.551 --> 33:27.984
See you, girls.
- See you, dad.

33:28.019 --> 33:29.111
- Bye.

33:42.634 --> 33:45.364
- So who is she?

33:45.403 --> 33:47.337
- l don't really know.

33:47.372 --> 33:50.205
- How did you meet?

33:50.241 --> 33:52.300
- When l went out walking.

33:52.344 --> 33:54.244
She was out walking too.

33:58.516 --> 34:01.713
She-she's just going through
some stuff at home

34:01.753 --> 34:04.517
and needed a place to stay.

34:04.556 --> 34:07.389
- Do you think that's what the
bruises on her arms were about?

34:10.195 --> 34:12.219
You know what l love about you?

34:13.598 --> 34:16.192
You're kind.

34:16.234 --> 34:18.395
And clearly she has issues.

34:20.071 --> 34:22.938
Just be careful.

34:22.974 --> 34:24.304
- Yeah, l will.

34:51.668 --> 34:52.658
- Bang!

34:53.737 --> 34:55.933
You're dead.

34:56.875 --> 34:57.864
God damn it.

34:59.277 --> 35:01.837
- Ah, see?
That shit makes you paranoid.

35:08.720 --> 35:09.812
- What?

35:11.289 --> 35:13.450
- l'm not really sure
what to make of you.

35:16.795 --> 35:19.161
- You can make
whatever you want of me.

35:21.199 --> 35:22.791
You feel like sharing?

35:33.978 --> 35:35.411
Do you like me?

35:37.615 --> 35:39.583
- l think so.

35:39.617 --> 35:40.948
- Don't be a coward.

35:40.985 --> 35:42.976
Either you like me,
or you don't.

35:44.122 --> 35:45.851
So which is it?

35:50.462 --> 35:51.724
- Yes.

35:53.631 --> 35:55.258
- Yes, what?

35:55.300 --> 35:57.495
- l like you.

35:57.535 --> 35:59.628
- Good.

35:59.671 --> 36:01.263
l like you too.

36:09.314 --> 36:11.680
lsn't there something
about dark waters

36:11.716 --> 36:15.117
that just gives you the creeps?

36:15.153 --> 36:18.680
You know, it's like,
even in pools,

36:18.723 --> 36:20.315
l'm just sitting there
waiting for something

36:20.358 --> 36:22.519
to come up and bite me.

36:25.930 --> 36:28.592
You ever gone swimming
in the ocean at night?

36:30.101 --> 36:31.090
- No.

36:31.135 --> 36:33.501
- That's creepy.

36:33.538 --> 36:37.235
Floating there with your-
with your head above water

36:37.275 --> 36:40.802
and the rest of you
submerged in blackness.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.711
You have no idea
what's under you.

36:45.750 --> 36:50.414
Things that are bigger
and more dangerous

36:50.455 --> 36:52.821
than you'll ever be.

36:52.857 --> 36:55.257
And you're in their territory.

36:55.293 --> 36:58.023
Does that sound weird?

36:58.062 --> 36:59.461
- No.

37:00.899 --> 37:04.357
Well, l think everyone gets
a rise out of tempting fate.

37:04.402 --> 37:06.165
That's the whole point.

37:06.204 --> 37:07.967
- Hmm.

37:23.454 --> 37:26.787
Do you want to try something
with me?

37:28.126 --> 37:30.117
- Shh!
Everybody's sleeping.

37:50.148 --> 37:51.513
- Come with me.

38:06.164 --> 38:07.859
You know what this is?

38:10.468 --> 38:11.901
- No.

38:11.936 --> 38:13.767
- lt talks to the dead.

38:15.206 --> 38:19.939
The Morellos left it here,
and l found it.

38:19.978 --> 38:21.309
- Does it work?

38:21.346 --> 38:23.576
- l don't know.
l've never tried it.

38:23.615 --> 38:24.877
- Why not?

38:24.916 --> 38:28.784
- Guess l was waiting for
the right person to try it with.

38:33.124 --> 38:34.614
- You curious?

38:41.165 --> 38:42.689
- Have you seen these?

38:42.734 --> 38:43.860
- Yeah.

38:43.901 --> 38:45.698
Yeah, that's the Morellos.

38:45.737 --> 38:48.001
See?

38:48.039 --> 38:49.904
lf we talk to anyone,
it'd be them.

39:23.708 --> 39:24.800
- You ready?

39:46.898 --> 39:49.264
ls anyone here?

39:50.368 --> 39:52.666
- Shh!

39:52.704 --> 39:53.796
- Sorry.

40:11.255 --> 40:13.587
- ls anyone in here?

40:25.203 --> 40:28.832
- Well, l guess
it's just not meant to be.

40:28.873 --> 40:30.534
Come on, let's get out of here.
lt creeps me out.

40:32.043 --> 40:34.443
My room. My room.

40:34.479 --> 40:36.037
Stay. Stay out.

40:42.286 --> 40:44.015
- Did you say that?

40:44.055 --> 40:45.647
- No.

40:51.796 --> 40:53.787
Sam, be serious.

40:55.133 --> 40:57.033
- l'm being serious.

40:59.871 --> 41:02.362
l'm being serious.

41:08.479 --> 41:11.277
Hey, what happened?

41:11.315 --> 41:12.543
- lt worked.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.743
- Well, yeah, it worked.

41:13.785 --> 41:15.844
That's kind of the whole point.

41:15.887 --> 41:18.879
- No, the point
is to want it to work

41:18.923 --> 41:21.517
and then go, ''Oh, shucks,''
when it doesn't.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.555
- Well, that seems
kind of pointless.

41:30.501 --> 41:32.332
Hey, are you okay?

41:36.541 --> 41:37.599
- Okay.

41:38.743 --> 41:41.576
What just happened in there
could mean one of two things.

41:42.780 --> 41:48.377
One, a ghost, a literal ghost,
just talked with us,

41:48.419 --> 41:53.755
or two,
our subconscious

41:53.791 --> 41:57.420
wanted it to happen so badly
that we manifested it

41:57.461 --> 42:01.761
with some hidden, messed-up part
of ourselves.

42:05.436 --> 42:06.733
What?

42:08.906 --> 42:11.272
- l think you need
to see something.

42:12.243 --> 42:13.540
Get your coat.

42:15.713 --> 42:18.238
l think there's a memorial stone
out here...

42:19.584 --> 42:20.573
somewhere.

42:27.925 --> 42:29.392
Hang on.
l think it's over here.

42:59.190 --> 43:00.316
- Shit.

43:07.465 --> 43:11.026
lt's all the kids' stuff,
a whole pile of it.

43:11.068 --> 43:12.262
What would it be doing out here?

43:12.303 --> 43:14.168
- Morello went insane.

43:27.451 --> 43:28.611
Hey, come here.

43:38.429 --> 43:39.828
- Matthew Morello?

43:39.864 --> 43:41.331
- l think
that's who talked to us.

43:49.106 --> 43:50.767
Hey.

43:50.808 --> 43:53.038
l'm going.

43:53.077 --> 43:55.443
- Going where?

43:55.479 --> 43:57.003
- Home.

43:58.249 --> 44:00.479
- What's waiting for you there?

44:01.519 --> 44:03.214
- lt's none of your business.

44:11.228 --> 44:14.197
- What if l wanted
to make it my business?

44:15.399 --> 44:17.924
- And how do you suppose
you do that?

44:19.070 --> 44:22.836
You gonna come over
and beat up my drunk dad?

44:29.013 --> 44:30.310
lf...

44:31.549 --> 44:34.382
if l stay with you...

44:36.287 --> 44:37.754
tonight...

44:39.290 --> 44:41.258
would l be causing trouble?

44:43.761 --> 44:47.891
- Besides, l don't really want
to be alone tonight.

44:48.933 --> 44:51.834
- Yeah.

44:51.869 --> 44:53.427
Neither do l.

44:57.008 --> 44:59.875
My mother left
when l was just a baby,

44:59.910 --> 45:01.707
and my dad hated her for it.

45:01.746 --> 45:04.306
And l guess l did too.

45:06.717 --> 45:09.948
l've just always been drawn
to this place.

45:11.555 --> 45:13.853
lt's like something's
pulling me here.

45:19.330 --> 45:21.924
Are you scared?

45:24.035 --> 45:26.970
l don't know.

45:27.004 --> 45:28.596
Are you?

45:31.242 --> 45:33.836
- No.

45:33.878 --> 45:35.345
- Why not?

45:37.748 --> 45:39.545
- Because l...

45:39.583 --> 45:41.346
l want it to be true.

45:43.354 --> 45:44.821
- Why?

45:47.191 --> 45:49.125
- Because if there's ghosts,

45:49.160 --> 45:51.685
then maybe there's a heaven.

45:53.030 --> 45:54.657
- Are you okay, Sam?

45:59.970 --> 46:01.631
- l don't know.

47:10.307 --> 47:12.434
- Thanks.
l appreciate it.

47:12.476 --> 47:14.068
- Don't go thanking me yet.

47:14.111 --> 47:16.409
l'm gonna make myself
a bowl of cereal,

47:16.447 --> 47:18.244
think about all the shit
l'm about to give you.

47:26.023 --> 47:28.617
- Oh, l'm so excited
for when it gets warm.

47:30.494 --> 47:32.018
Yeah.

47:32.062 --> 47:34.462
l can go swimming
every single day.

47:36.467 --> 47:37.764
Oh, it's not dangerous.

47:37.801 --> 47:38.859
You're being silly.

47:38.903 --> 47:41.098
l'm a really, really,
really good swimmer,

47:41.138 --> 47:43.902
so it'll all be okay.

47:45.209 --> 47:46.767
Oh, yeah. Me too.

47:49.413 --> 47:51.244
But why would we leave?

47:54.218 --> 47:55.207
Well, l like it here.

47:55.252 --> 47:57.186
- Anita?

47:57.221 --> 47:58.188
- Yeah?

47:58.222 --> 48:00.713
- ls everything okay?

48:00.758 --> 48:02.726
- Yeah.

48:02.760 --> 48:04.193
- Okay.

48:07.131 --> 48:09.565
- Don't-don't say that.

48:11.068 --> 48:12.831
You're-you're just trying
to scare me.

48:33.224 --> 48:34.714
- Hi.

48:34.758 --> 48:37.056
- Morning.

48:37.094 --> 48:38.925
These are for you.

48:47.371 --> 48:48.338
l don't know.

48:48.372 --> 48:50.397
lf l imagined it,
then Sam imagined it too.

48:50.441 --> 48:52.238
But we were kind of stoned,
so...

48:54.044 --> 48:55.443
- Oh.

48:55.479 --> 48:56.707
- Morning.
- Hey.

48:56.747 --> 48:57.736
- Hey, Dad.

49:01.785 --> 49:03.548
- Well...

49:03.587 --> 49:04.884
maybe you two were having

49:04.922 --> 49:09.416
some kind of shared
lovers' hallucination thing?

49:09.460 --> 49:11.519
You know,
a little adventure,

49:11.562 --> 49:13.723
dash of danger.

49:18.602 --> 49:20.297
lt really happened,
didn't it?

49:22.940 --> 49:24.202
lt really happened.

50:05.049 --> 50:07.609
Coming to this house
was a bad idea.

50:08.552 --> 50:10.383
- Don't say that.

50:10.421 --> 50:11.979
- Why not?

50:12.022 --> 50:14.513
- 'Cause it means a lot
to Mom and Dad.

50:15.859 --> 50:17.190
- You know,
people who believe

50:17.227 --> 50:19.718
in this sort of thing
always talk about opening doors

50:19.763 --> 50:21.458
and inviting things through.

50:21.498 --> 50:22.760
l know it sounds hokey,

50:22.800 --> 50:25.098
but l think it's best if we
don't go testing the theory.

51:01.972 --> 51:03.963
Samantha.

51:05.709 --> 51:07.574
Samantha!

51:09.456 --> 51:13.234
<b>Subtitle by JustCosmin</b>

51:16.754 --> 51:17.846
- Hey.

51:17.888 --> 51:19.480
- No! Get off me!
Get off me!

51:19.523 --> 51:21.650
- Hey!
Shh! Shh! Shh!

51:21.692 --> 51:23.751
lt's okay. Shh. Shh.

51:26.096 --> 51:27.256
- lt's okay.

51:29.733 --> 51:31.428
- My name.

51:31.468 --> 51:33.026
She said my name.

51:46.350 --> 51:48.682
- Do you want to talk about it?

51:48.719 --> 51:50.983
- l doubt it, Mom.

51:51.021 --> 51:52.079
- Well, maybe she does.

51:52.122 --> 51:53.419
We're a family that talks,

51:53.457 --> 51:55.721
so if you would like
to talk about it, then-

51:55.759 --> 51:57.590
- l was just spooked.

51:59.263 --> 52:00.662
l-l'm sorry.
l don't know why.

52:02.266 --> 52:03.665
- Yes, you do.

52:05.402 --> 52:06.494
- Sarah.

52:06.537 --> 52:08.061
- l'm sorry, but if this
is really happening,

52:08.105 --> 52:09.333
we need to talk about it.

52:09.373 --> 52:11.000
- What's really happening?

52:12.910 --> 52:14.901
Evan, what is Sarah
talking about?

52:19.450 --> 52:24.615
We tried to do
a kind of sance.

52:24.655 --> 52:26.555
- Sance?

52:26.590 --> 52:28.251
Okay.

52:30.561 --> 52:32.620
- And it worked.

52:32.663 --> 52:34.631
- lt did?

52:34.665 --> 52:37.463
- Yeah.

52:37.501 --> 52:39.025
- That must have been scary.

52:39.069 --> 52:40.730
Yeah.

52:40.771 --> 52:41.931
- l'm sorry, Dad.

52:41.972 --> 52:44.031
l don't think
this is very funny.

52:44.074 --> 52:46.065
- You're not telling me
you believe this, do you?

52:46.109 --> 52:47.542
- Maybe l'm imagining the fact

52:47.578 --> 52:48.738
that we're kind of
living in a house

52:48.779 --> 52:50.371
that a lot of people think
is haunted.

52:50.414 --> 52:54.248
- Sarah, don't let
the communal superstition

52:54.284 --> 52:56.411
color your perception
of the facts.

52:56.453 --> 52:58.250
- That is the most
important lesson

52:58.288 --> 53:00.848
that history can teach us,
all right?

53:02.326 --> 53:04.886
- Okay.
So what are the facts?

53:04.928 --> 53:07.988
- The facts are that Evan
and Sam played a scary game

53:08.031 --> 53:09.464
and Sam got scared.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.024
- There you have it,
okay?

53:11.068 --> 53:13.332
So why don't you two stay away

53:13.370 --> 53:14.928
from the scary stuff,
all right?

53:14.972 --> 53:16.837
- Way ahead of you.

53:16.874 --> 53:19.399
Evan already promised me
that they wouldn't do it again.

53:20.744 --> 53:22.336
- Good enough.

53:22.379 --> 53:24.438
- l think you should
make friends with it.

53:28.752 --> 53:30.583
- What's that, honey?

53:30.621 --> 53:33.886
- Well, if there's really
a ghost in Evan's room,

53:33.924 --> 53:36.085
l think he should make friends
with it.

53:36.126 --> 53:39.254
- Well, that's
an interesting idea,

53:39.296 --> 53:41.491
but l think we should just
leave well enough alone.

53:41.532 --> 53:42.556
- Yeah.

53:42.599 --> 53:45.625
- Well, if there was
a ghost in my room,

53:45.669 --> 53:47.933
l'd try to keep it happy.

54:00.617 --> 54:02.380
- Sam?

54:02.419 --> 54:04.478
Can l talk with you for a sec?

54:04.521 --> 54:05.852
- Mom, she's fine.

54:05.889 --> 54:08.050
- Just sit down with me.

54:17.601 --> 54:19.296
You're probably gonna hate this.

54:19.336 --> 54:22.396
This is one of those weird adult
talks that makes kids sick,

54:22.439 --> 54:25.067
and l'm practically a stranger.

54:25.108 --> 54:28.669
But you entered my son's life
rather abruptly,

54:28.712 --> 54:31.476
which means
you've entered my life.

54:32.583 --> 54:35.313
l could be a friend to you,
if you let me.

54:36.620 --> 54:38.212
- Okay.

54:39.489 --> 54:42.185
- l know how unfair it is.

54:42.225 --> 54:44.750
l get it.

54:44.795 --> 54:46.524
- You get what?

54:48.332 --> 54:50.129
- This.

54:51.001 --> 54:54.562
- No, that's-that's not
what you think.

54:54.605 --> 54:56.436
- Come on, Sam.

54:56.473 --> 54:58.964
lf you don't want to talk to me,

54:59.009 --> 55:00.670
you could talk
to a professional,

55:00.711 --> 55:01.735
someone who will listen

55:01.778 --> 55:04.406
and keep what you say
to themselves.

55:04.448 --> 55:05.506
- No.

55:05.549 --> 55:07.107
Thanks, but no.

55:07.150 --> 55:08.515
- There's no shame in it.

55:08.552 --> 55:10.179
- l'm not ashamed.

55:12.389 --> 55:14.357
- You have him wrapped
around your finger.

55:14.391 --> 55:16.052
l think you know that.

55:17.527 --> 55:19.119
Don't hurt him.

55:25.435 --> 55:28.302
- They're taking Sarah
to visit a couple of colleges.

55:28.338 --> 55:31.171
- Are they nervous
leaving us alone?

55:31.208 --> 55:33.199
- Yeah, kind of.

55:33.243 --> 55:34.938
- What'd they say?

55:36.880 --> 55:38.404
- That they're nervous.

56:04.741 --> 56:06.299
- Evan.

56:06.343 --> 56:07.708
- Yeah?

56:13.383 --> 56:15.180
- You know how kids
can understand things

56:15.218 --> 56:16.742
that adults can't?

56:19.289 --> 56:20.779
- Sure.

56:20.824 --> 56:23.349
- Well?

56:23.393 --> 56:25.884
- Well, what?

56:25.929 --> 56:27.726
- Well...

56:27.764 --> 56:29.026
like your sister said,

56:29.066 --> 56:30.328
do you want
to make friends with it,

56:30.367 --> 56:33.495
or do you want
to live with an angry ghost?

56:43.013 --> 56:44.571
- What?

56:48.685 --> 56:50.346
What?
What are you thinking?

56:52.823 --> 56:54.688
- About that thing you said.

56:58.995 --> 57:00.963
Do you think it's possible
that maybe you want

57:00.997 --> 57:03.761
to prove there's a heaven
a little too badly?

57:06.269 --> 57:10.399
- So, in other words,
l'm making all of this up.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.702
- No, l didn't say that.

57:11.742 --> 57:14.438
- Then what did you say?

57:14.478 --> 57:19.313
- l'm saying that there's a lot
of good things about this life.

57:20.817 --> 57:23.411
Why rush looking
for whatever comes next?

57:23.453 --> 57:26.047
l'm saying l'm scared
of the consequences.

57:31.995 --> 57:36.830
- l need to know what it wants,
okay?

57:36.867 --> 57:39.631
l stared her in the eye.

57:39.669 --> 57:43.230
And l lost my nerve,
and l wasn't prepared.

57:43.273 --> 57:44.365
But l don't know.

57:44.407 --> 57:48.343
l feel like this is-
this is one of those moments,

57:48.378 --> 57:50.278
a moment to really
discover something,

57:50.313 --> 57:53.749
and it's happening to us,
you and me.

57:58.021 --> 57:59.010
Do you really want to stop

57:59.055 --> 58:01.148
before you figure out
how it ends?

58:20.510 --> 58:22.808
What are you doing?

58:22.846 --> 58:24.211
- Coaxing.

58:35.859 --> 58:37.554
- What happened to you?

58:38.929 --> 58:40.419
- That's the spirit.

58:47.838 --> 58:48.896
- Okay.

58:51.007 --> 58:52.201
You ready?

59:17.400 --> 59:18.924
Matthew?

59:21.371 --> 59:23.100
Matthew, are you there?

59:28.411 --> 59:30.606
Matthew, l really need to talk
to you.

59:30.647 --> 59:32.706
What have you been trying
to tell us?

59:45.228 --> 59:46.354
Okay, Matthew.

59:46.396 --> 59:48.626
lf you won't talk to me,
maybe someone else will.

59:51.701 --> 59:53.134
Hilary?

59:54.671 --> 59:55.729
Kate?

59:57.107 --> 59:58.404
Franklin?

59:59.876 --> 01:00:02.504
- Samantha.

01:00:05.315 --> 01:00:06.839
Sorry.

01:00:09.653 --> 01:00:12.247
- Franklin, what happened
in this house?

01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:13.779
What happened to your family?

01:00:16.593 --> 01:00:19.153
- My room.

01:00:19.195 --> 01:00:20.457
My room.

01:00:20.497 --> 01:00:21.987
- Matthew?

01:00:24.734 --> 01:00:28.465
- She's comjng.
Closer and closer.

01:00:28.505 --> 01:00:30.336
- She? Who's she?

01:00:31.942 --> 01:00:33.466
- Was she who l saw?

01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:35.444
- She'll hear you.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.745
- So who is she?
- Sam...

01:00:38.782 --> 01:00:40.010
- Matthew, did she kill you?

01:00:42.652 --> 01:00:44.051
- She's here!

01:00:44.087 --> 01:00:46.214
She's here!

01:00:48.658 --> 01:00:52.788
- Don't you move!

01:01:06.609 --> 01:01:08.201
Please let me go.

01:01:12.315 --> 01:01:14.283
Please let me go!

01:01:14.317 --> 01:01:16.308
Please! Please!

01:01:56.226 --> 01:01:57.215
- Evan?

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:05.664
Evan?

01:02:15.712 --> 01:02:16.974
Evan?

01:02:26.322 --> 01:02:27.584
- Evan?

01:02:32.328 --> 01:02:33.317
Evan.

01:02:34.998 --> 01:02:37.262
No! No! No!
Evan! Evan! Evan!

01:03:26.249 --> 01:03:29.184
- Sam.
Look, l need to talk to you.

01:03:29.219 --> 01:03:31.847
l don't know what happened to me
last night.

01:03:31.888 --> 01:03:33.014
l'm sorry.

01:03:33.056 --> 01:03:34.421
l have to see you, okay?

01:03:34.457 --> 01:03:35.754
l need to see you.

01:03:35.792 --> 01:03:37.225
Call me, please.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.693
l'm worried about you.

01:03:38.728 --> 01:03:39.854
Okay, bye.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.505
- Yeah, l heard you
the first time.

01:03:59.549 --> 01:04:00.948
What do you want?

01:04:00.984 --> 01:04:03.452
- l was hoping l could speak
with Sam.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.480
- Who are you?
A boyfriend?

01:04:09.359 --> 01:04:12.385
- l'm not sure, exactly.

01:04:12.428 --> 01:04:14.794
- Sam can't come
to the phone right now.

01:04:14.831 --> 01:04:16.856
Leave a message after the beep.

01:04:32.182 --> 01:04:33.479
- Hi.

01:04:35.285 --> 01:04:36.616
- Hey.

01:04:41.257 --> 01:04:43.487
- God, l'm sorry
about your eye.

01:04:43.526 --> 01:04:45.050
- lt's not your fault.

01:04:45.094 --> 01:04:47.187
- Yeah, it is.

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:49.994
- lt doesn't matter.

01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:52.365
We're in this together.

01:04:52.402 --> 01:04:53.596
- Okay.

01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:05.210
- l'm not sure about this.

01:05:05.248 --> 01:05:07.045
- Maybe she can tell us
something.

01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:08.243
- Something like what?

01:05:08.284 --> 01:05:09.911
- Like something useful,

01:05:09.953 --> 01:05:13.081
something we should know,
something that could help us.

01:05:13.122 --> 01:05:14.817
She was there the whole time.

01:05:14.857 --> 01:05:16.654
Maybe she saw something.

01:05:16.693 --> 01:05:18.422
Maybe there's something
we need to do.

01:05:18.461 --> 01:05:19.450
- Do?

01:05:19.495 --> 01:05:20.587
- Yeah.

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:22.393
- Well, what do you mean, do?

01:05:22.432 --> 01:05:24.525
- Well, maybe it wants us
to do something,

01:05:24.567 --> 01:05:26.159
like unfinished business.

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:29.761
- No.

01:05:29.806 --> 01:05:31.239
- No?

01:05:31.274 --> 01:05:33.606
- Whatever we started,
we need to stop.

01:05:33.643 --> 01:05:34.905
Okay?

01:05:34.944 --> 01:05:36.070
l'm not curious anymore.

01:05:36.112 --> 01:05:37.477
l'm scared.

01:05:37.513 --> 01:05:39.037
l'm scared we went too far.

01:05:39.082 --> 01:05:41.482
l'm-l'm scared
you're gonna get hurt.

01:05:43.052 --> 01:05:47.045
Hey, l wanted to see if we
could find a heaven, not...

01:05:49.492 --> 01:05:51.187
not a hell.

01:05:55.398 --> 01:05:56.990
- Then what do you think
we should do?

01:05:57.033 --> 01:05:59.331
- We should stop

01:05:59.369 --> 01:06:00.893
and pretend it never happened.

01:06:00.937 --> 01:06:02.871
Eventually it'll go away.

01:06:02.905 --> 01:06:05.806
- Sam, l don't think
it's gonna go away.

01:06:06.776 --> 01:06:10.007
You know, l just figure
we've gone this far.

01:06:11.381 --> 01:06:13.542
Why don't we go
a little further?

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:15.813
What do we gain from pretending
like it never happened?

01:06:15.852 --> 01:06:17.319
lt did happen.

01:06:17.353 --> 01:06:19.753
And whatever's in there isn't
just gonna forget about us.

01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:22.553
- So what do you suggest we do?

01:06:22.592 --> 01:06:24.787
- We just talk
with her a little,

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:26.795
see what she has to say.

01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:28.729
l mean, maybe she can let us
know what we're up against,

01:06:28.765 --> 01:06:30.460
what it wants.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:35.130
- Evan, you need
to listen to me.

01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:36.866
The way your face...

01:06:39.242 --> 01:06:43.338
changed,
you looked like it.

01:06:43.379 --> 01:06:45.813
Do you understand
what that means?

01:06:45.848 --> 01:06:47.713
lt got inside you.

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:50.150
- Look, if we started this,

01:06:50.186 --> 01:06:52.177
then we need to finish it.

01:07:28.224 --> 01:07:29.623
- Yes?

01:07:29.659 --> 01:07:32.219
- Mrs. Morello?
lt's Evan Asher.

01:07:33.863 --> 01:07:35.057
- Oh.

01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:37.032
What are you doing here?

01:07:37.066 --> 01:07:39.660
- We need your help.

01:07:39.702 --> 01:07:41.397
- My help?

01:07:41.437 --> 01:07:42.904
- Can we come in?

01:07:44.407 --> 01:07:45.874
- No. No.

01:07:45.908 --> 01:07:48.035
l-l don't think so.

01:07:48.077 --> 01:07:51.171
What do you mean,
you need my help?

01:07:51.214 --> 01:07:53.114
- There's something
in that house,

01:07:53.149 --> 01:07:55.413
and we need
to know what it is.

01:08:11.934 --> 01:08:13.993
- What are you talking about?

01:08:14.036 --> 01:08:15.663
Something where?

01:08:15.705 --> 01:08:18.002
- Well, it's not
so much where as-

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.734
- A ghost, okay?

01:08:19.776 --> 01:08:22.006
lt's a ghost.

01:08:22.044 --> 01:08:24.171
And we thought maybe
you could help us.

01:08:35.024 --> 01:08:36.719
How could you?

01:08:38.227 --> 01:08:40.889
How could you come here

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:44.661
and disturb what little peace
l have left?

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:51.439
Have you been messing about

01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:55.308
in that little room
with that box?

01:08:56.712 --> 01:08:59.145
Now, you listen to me.

01:08:59.182 --> 01:09:03.915
You burn that box
and stay out of there.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.587
- Stay out of there!

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.094
- Evan.

01:09:15.731 --> 01:09:18.165
Hey!

01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:19.792
Evan!
- What?

01:09:19.836 --> 01:09:21.962
- What if she's wrong?
She makes it seem so simple.

01:09:22.004 --> 01:09:23.095
What if it isn't?

01:09:23.139 --> 01:09:24.470
- We don't have a choice.

01:09:49.999 --> 01:09:51.728
Here.

01:10:46.656 --> 01:10:48.214
There.

01:10:49.392 --> 01:10:51.690
No one will ever
bother you again.

01:10:52.728 --> 01:10:54.855
You have a room all your own.

01:10:57.099 --> 01:10:58.896
Now stay out of mine.

01:11:06.275 --> 01:11:07.902
- Hey.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.714
Everything's gonna be okay,
right?

01:11:15.618 --> 01:11:16.915
- Yeah.

01:11:19.255 --> 01:11:21.246
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.484
- So it's over?

01:11:28.264 --> 01:11:29.925
- lt's over.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:32.895
Okay.

01:11:53.222 --> 01:11:55.190
- Hi, this is the Ashers.
Leave a message.

01:11:56.225 --> 01:11:57.715
- Hey, it's Dad.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.125
They've closed
the road to the house,

01:11:59.161 --> 01:12:00.526
so we're kind of
stuck down here,

01:12:00.563 --> 01:12:02.053
some kind of accident...

01:12:06.335 --> 01:12:07.427
On your own.

01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:08.937
As soon as they reopen
the road,

01:12:08.971 --> 01:12:10.438
We'll head home.

01:14:24.807 --> 01:14:27.640
- Matthew!
l'm begging you.

01:14:27.676 --> 01:14:29.769
Don't make a sound.

01:14:29.812 --> 01:14:33.077
And don't you move.

01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.230
Evan.

01:15:50.259 --> 01:15:52.523
Evan?
Evan!

01:15:54.463 --> 01:15:55.452
Evan, get the door open!

01:15:55.497 --> 01:15:56.691
- l can't!
lt won't open!

01:15:59.635 --> 01:16:01.603
- Evan, she's coming!

01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:06.002
Please!

01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:07.440
- Please!

01:16:07.476 --> 01:16:09.671
Please let me go!

01:16:13.749 --> 01:16:16.047
Please, let me go!
Please!

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:17.643
- Evan.

01:16:19.455 --> 01:16:21.446
- Tell me something.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:22.582
- Let me go!

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:25.822
- Do you really and honestly
think l'm gonna let you go?

01:16:25.861 --> 01:16:28.921
Please.

01:16:28.964 --> 01:16:30.192
Please!

01:16:30.232 --> 01:16:34.032
- Listen to your voice,
all breathy and delightful,

01:16:34.069 --> 01:16:35.934
even when you're terrified.

01:16:35.971 --> 01:16:37.199
- No!

01:16:37.239 --> 01:16:40.402
- ls that what she sounded like
in bed, my dear?

01:16:42.211 --> 01:16:43.872
- l'm sorry.

01:16:43.913 --> 01:16:46.473
- Please, don't do this!

01:16:46.515 --> 01:16:47.641
l'll do anything!

01:16:47.683 --> 01:16:51.744
- Oh, l think you've already
done enough, haven't you?

01:16:51.787 --> 01:16:52.913
- Franklin!

01:16:52.955 --> 01:16:54.616
- You seduced my husband.

01:16:54.657 --> 01:16:57.490
You brought his illegitimate
bitch into the world.

01:16:57.526 --> 01:16:59.426
Poor little Samantha.

01:16:59.461 --> 01:17:03.363
And you've held the brat
under my nose,

01:17:03.399 --> 01:17:06.129
expecting me not
to sniff it out,

01:17:06.168 --> 01:17:08.966
expecting me not
to do anything about it.

01:17:09.004 --> 01:17:10.130
- Aah! No!

01:17:15.678 --> 01:17:17.771
- Franklin.

01:17:17.813 --> 01:17:20.543
Look.
l want you to see this.

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:23.208
Franklin, look at me!

01:17:25.654 --> 01:17:26.712
No!

01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:32.652
No!

01:17:34.763 --> 01:17:36.697
- Are you ready,
young lady?

01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:02.448
- Please don't hurt him.

01:18:02.491 --> 01:18:04.459
Please.

01:18:12.234 --> 01:18:13.861
- Sam.

01:18:20.309 --> 01:18:21.708
Hey.

01:18:28.617 --> 01:18:30.517
Sam. lt's me.

01:18:34.723 --> 01:18:36.782
- You shouldn't have closed
that door.

01:18:36.825 --> 01:18:38.258
- Please.

01:18:38.293 --> 01:18:39.624
- Hey, guys.
We're home.

01:18:39.661 --> 01:18:41.720
- Something's wrong.
- Where's the lights?

01:18:41.764 --> 01:18:44.062
- You shouldn't have burned
that box!

01:19:16.832 --> 01:19:18.322
- No! No!

01:19:18.367 --> 01:19:20.062
No!

01:19:20.102 --> 01:19:21.091
- Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

01:19:21.136 --> 01:19:22.865
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

01:19:24.373 --> 01:19:26.238
Mommy. Mommy.

01:19:26.275 --> 01:19:27.299
- No!

01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.509
Mommy!

01:19:52.301 --> 01:19:56.032
- And that,
as they say, is that.

01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:02.769
The Ashers left, and the girl
was sent away.

01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:07.976
She was just a cancerous
little thing, like her mother.

01:20:10.018 --> 01:20:13.146
How did l feel when l heard?

01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:14.917
l felt nothing.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.928
l wonder now if the boy

01:20:19.962 --> 01:20:23.830
will haunt that rotting house
forever,

01:20:23.866 --> 01:20:26.426
along with my family,

01:20:26.468 --> 01:20:30.632
waiting for others to arrive
to share the truths they'd find,

01:20:30.672 --> 01:20:34.733
the truths we'll all
someday find.

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:40.214
Death, after all, is the house
we all finally come home to.

01:20:40.249 --> 01:20:42.240
Rest assured of that.

01:20:46.755 --> 01:20:49.315
See, every ghost story
might begin

01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:51.826
With a house and a tragedy,

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.853
but they don't alWays
end the same.

01:20:55.898 --> 01:21:00.267
Sometimes the tragedy
stays buried,

01:21:00.302 --> 01:21:04.671
and some houses
are more dead than others.
