01:34.385 --> 01:37.347
And we will be
broadcasting live from the fairgrounds

01:37.430 --> 01:40.350
in Pueblo on Friday
and again next Tuesday.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.060
Mike and I will be eating corn dogs.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.270
Mike says that's his favorite.
Rob, what's yours?

01:44.354 --> 01:46.648
It's gonna be the funnel cake,
I must admit, yes.

01:46.731 --> 01:49.192
The funnel cake?
Okay, hope to see you guys all there.

01:49.275 --> 01:52.445
Lena, thank you. Well, right now,
looking a lot like fall outside...

02:10.547 --> 02:13.341
Looking due west, so we do have...

02:13.842 --> 02:15.885
And, uh, you know, for the most part,

02:15.969 --> 02:17.971
they're not dumping a lot of rain
at this point.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.182
They actually have some movement to them,
so not very stationary,

02:21.266 --> 02:23.768
staying on point, I should say.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.812
So, as we go through
the hour-by-hour here,

02:25.895 --> 02:28.255
maybe around midnight tonight...
We're gonna stop this here.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.738
- Hello, Louis.
- Hello, Mrs. Moore.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.322
Addie.

02:38.908 --> 02:40.451
Is everything all right?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.454
Can I talk to you about something?

02:43.538 --> 02:44.538
Sure.

02:46.457 --> 02:48.418
- May I come in?
- Oh, oh, yeah, sure.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.549
This is the next storm system moving
into the Pacific Northwest.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.135
This will come in our direction
over the next two days

02:57.218 --> 02:59.262
and really clear everything
on out of here.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.390
So the highs today,
we only saw the lower 70s today.

03:02.473 --> 03:03.558
Tomorrow, much the same.

03:03.641 --> 03:06.019
We're gonna be embedded
in a lot of cloud cover,

03:06.102 --> 03:07.854
maybe a few streaks of sun here and there.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.481
But by Saturday, watch this.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.150
So...

03:12.233 --> 03:15.528
by the time we get into Sunday
because that system comes right through,

03:15.612 --> 03:17.322
- dries us out...
- Oh, oh! I'm so sorry.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.750
I want to suggest something to you.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.794
It's a... proposal of sorts.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.088
Not marriage.

03:36.925 --> 03:41.137
It is a kind of marriage-like question,
actually, but, um...

03:43.598 --> 03:45.642
I'm getting cold feet.

03:47.977 --> 03:51.522
Would you be interested in coming
to my house sometime to sleep with me?

03:53.775 --> 03:56.527
- Did I take your breath away?
- Yeah.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.072
See...

03:59.864 --> 04:00.865
we're both alone.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.912
You know, we've been on our own for...
for years.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.995
And, uh...

04:10.416 --> 04:13.962
I'm lonely,
and I'm guessing you might be, too.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.591
Louis, it's not about sex.

04:23.179 --> 04:25.807
I lost interest in that a long time ago.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.766
No, it's, um...

04:30.561 --> 04:32.814
It's about getting through the night,
you know?

04:34.023 --> 04:35.023
About...

04:35.858 --> 04:39.988
lying down in bed together and...
And talking through the night

04:40.071 --> 04:42.156
until we fall asleep, that kind of thing.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.328
Nights are the worst, don't you think?

04:49.872 --> 04:54.585
But I think I could sleep again
if there was somebody next to me,

04:54.669 --> 04:56.421
you know, someone nice.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.594
- I don't know.
- Is it...

05:03.678 --> 05:05.972
Would that be something
of interest to you?

05:15.732 --> 05:16.941
Can I think about it?

05:19.110 --> 05:21.654
Certainly, of course.

05:26.242 --> 05:29.037
I'll... I'll call you, okay?
I'll give you a call.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.456
I'm sure Diane had your number
here somewhere.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.504
- Thank you for your time.
- No, thank you.

05:41.215 --> 05:44.260
Oh, here. Stupid door.
Here, let me get that.

05:48.848 --> 05:49.848
Thank you.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.926
He's a puzzle. He's a puzzle.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.763
And if he drinks half as much
as I hear he does,

06:29.055 --> 06:31.057
then I am glad he lost his job.

06:31.140 --> 06:35.353
About time, I say.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.605
- And his dad...
- I remember him.

06:37.688 --> 06:40.108
His dad was just exactly like him.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.360
He used to paint that old
kind of jalopy car

06:42.443 --> 06:47.115
all those ridiculous colors
and just for attention.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.577
And then he had the guts to drive
that piece of crap around town...

06:51.661 --> 06:54.247
cruising the streets.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.332
It was one ugly vehicle.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.877
We can say one thing
about those two guys, father and son...

06:59.961 --> 07:02.046
they knew what "cocktail hour" was.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.549
Oh, yeah.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.942
- Hello?
- Uh, Addie?

07:23.776 --> 07:24.776
Hello?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.697
- Addie?
- Hi!

07:29.157 --> 07:30.575
This is Louis Waters.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.035
- Hello, Louis.
- Hi.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.249
So, uh, I've been thinking
about what you suggested,

07:38.332 --> 07:39.667
and I think I'd like to try it.

07:41.961 --> 07:42.961
Oh.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.719
Well, uh, when... when were you thinking?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.387
Tomorrow night?

07:55.808 --> 07:57.268
What time tomorrow?

08:00.062 --> 08:01.062
Nine?

08:04.066 --> 08:06.944
- Okay, tomorrow works for me.
- Okay.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.531
- Um, I'll see you then.
- Right.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.529
What are you doing back here?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.616
Well, I wasn't sure if...
You know how it is. People talk.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.671
Um...

09:50.298 --> 09:51.799
How about a drink?

09:52.216 --> 09:53.509
Sounds like a good idea.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.885
Red okay?

09:58.556 --> 09:59.640
Do you have any beer?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.476
I'll get some beer for you next time.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.231
What, you don't think
there's going to be a next time?

10:07.815 --> 10:09.984
Oh, no, no. It's not that. It's just...

10:10.067 --> 10:12.445
Wait a minute.
How long have we known each other?

10:12.778 --> 10:14.155
How long have we been neighbors?

10:18.326 --> 10:21.120
- We don't really know each other.
- Well...

10:25.333 --> 10:27.418
How about we get to know each other?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.300
Go ahead, ask me a question. Anything.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.804
Pretty cold for spring, huh?

10:38.888 --> 10:41.432
Oh, really?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.517
We're gonna talk about the weather?

10:43.601 --> 10:46.354
What else is there to talk about?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.940
Literally anything else.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.152
I'm not much of a talker these days.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.780
Well, that's disappointing.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.306
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- What...

11:18.594 --> 11:19.594
Yeah.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.310
This is the living room.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.110
- And, uh...
- Oh.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.362
Bigger house than I thought, more rooms.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.031
It's been a good house for us.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.533
How long have you lived here?

11:43.119 --> 11:45.913
- 48 years.
- 48 years?

11:46.247 --> 11:47.623
That's a long time.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.461
Would you like to see the upstairs?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.381
Okay.

12:07.518 --> 12:11.355
So this was Connie's room.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.816
And this was Gene's room.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.863
And the bathroom.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.531
And, um...

12:23.242 --> 12:24.785
This is where we always slept.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.748
I'm sorry about the "we."

12:29.123 --> 12:30.583
Oh, I know what you mean.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.051
You getting in?

12:42.052 --> 12:43.052
Yeah.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.653
Awfully quiet, Louis.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.280
Yeah, well...

13:02.364 --> 13:05.075
I was just thinking how strange
this all seems.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.584
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea?

13:18.589 --> 13:21.217
Maybe... Maybe it could be.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.012
Yeah.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.517
Yeah, maybe it is.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.259
You know what else I was thinking?

14:10.432 --> 14:11.767
Are you still awake?

15:13.370 --> 15:15.497
Storms will continue
to march off to the east,

15:15.581 --> 15:18.000
and this model brings in
some redevelopment late tonight.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.001
This is 11 o'clock

15:19.084 --> 15:21.003
across El Paso County
back into Teller County,

15:21.086 --> 15:23.339
still another round
of shower activity possible.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.884
Overnight tonight, light rain possible
across parts of the viewing area.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.386
Nothing intense,
just a few raindrops on the rooftops,

15:29.470 --> 15:31.430
even for the drive early tomorrow morning.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.516
Light showers certainly possible
by 8:30 to nine.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.810
Even a couple of sprinkles in some areas.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.064
We're going to see dry conditions and
some sunshine during the midday hours.

15:40.147 --> 15:41.941
That'll help destabilize the atmosphere,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.777
so thunderstorms will develop again
tomorrow afternoon...

16:04.296 --> 16:06.215
I wasn't sure if you'd come back.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.298
Why not?

16:08.467 --> 16:09.677
I don't know.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.348
You didn't leave your pajamas here
last time.

16:15.182 --> 16:16.100
I didn't...

16:16.183 --> 16:18.185
I didn't want to seem presumptuous.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.604
It might be easier
if you left a few things here.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.649
Well, then you wouldn't
have to carry them.

16:33.701 --> 16:35.285
So... why me?

16:35.369 --> 16:38.247
What, you think I'd just pick anybody?

16:38.330 --> 16:40.290
Well, no, just curious. I just wondered.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.086
I always thought
you were someone I could talk to.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.297
And you're a lot better-looking

16:47.381 --> 16:49.461
- than Jerry Henderson. Yeah.
- Henderson?

16:54.972 --> 16:56.765
- You know, the truth is...
- Hmm?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.895
I always thought you were a good man.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.479
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

17:05.398 --> 17:08.359
So how have you thought of me,
if you ever have?

17:09.444 --> 17:11.739
Oh. I've thought of you.

17:16.827 --> 17:18.619
- No.
- No, not just that.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.083
But a person of substance,
of character.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.294
Whatever gave you that impression?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.921
Because the way you lived your life,

17:28.005 --> 17:30.257
the way you managed your life
after Carl died.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.677
I knew the way it was with Diane and me,

17:33.761 --> 17:37.389
and it seemed to me you were doing
a lot better than I was.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.766
And I... I admired that.

17:38.849 --> 17:43.145
But you never came over
or made a point of talking to me.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.522
Well... that would've been intrusive.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.649
- I mean...
- Yeah, intrusive.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.200
You know, I think...

17:58.702 --> 18:01.080
that you should come
through the front door next time.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.333
- Well, like I said, people talk.
- Oh, let them talk.

18:06.835 --> 18:12.174
You know, I've spent my whole life
worrying about what people think.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.807
So, uh, what else do you want to know?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.851
Well, I have some questions.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.394
Yeah, such as?

18:25.187 --> 18:27.981
Well, where you're from,
what you were like as a little girl,

18:28.065 --> 18:30.234
how you met Carl, who your friends are.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.111
Well, what? I could go on.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.529
I could... You know?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.739
What you believe in,
what party you vote for.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.925
- Hello?
- Oh, thank God.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.929
Holly?

18:59.012 --> 19:01.932
- I was ready to call the police.
- What's wrong?

19:02.516 --> 19:04.893
Nothing's wrong, Dad.
I was worried about you.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.479
I called three times last night.
You didn't answer.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.774
Oh, um...

19:11.817 --> 19:13.068
Where were you?

19:14.528 --> 19:16.321
I guess I just didn't hear
the phone, Holly.

19:19.241 --> 19:23.245
Well, maybe it's time you invest
in those hearing aids we talked about.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.372
What?

19:27.499 --> 19:28.499
Dad?

19:30.085 --> 19:33.046
Yes?
I was kidding, Holly. That's a joke.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
Oh.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.512
So what else is going on?
What are you up to?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.934
Uh, not much.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.994
- Well, hello, there.
- Oh.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.924
Tell me about the other woman.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.893
Her name was Tamara,
still is if she's alive.

21:12.229 --> 21:15.107
- She was a teacher, too, right?
- Uh-huh.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.902
Yeah. You know, I saw her
once or twice in the parking lot

21:18.986 --> 21:20.988
when I went to pick Gene up from school.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.574
She was tall, exotic.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.202
- Native American, right?
- Yeah.

21:34.793 --> 21:38.714
She was married to a salesman,
um, and they had a daughter,

21:38.797 --> 21:40.382
about the same age as Holly.

21:42.509 --> 21:46.346
Well, at that time, Diane and I,
we really weren't doing so well.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.430
Why not?

21:51.560 --> 21:52.602
Well, because of me.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.024
And a little bit her, too.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.526
You know, Holly was little,

21:59.609 --> 22:02.988
and neither one of us really, really knew
what we were doing,

22:03.071 --> 22:06.533
and we would have these arguments
that would turn into fights, and then...

22:06.867 --> 22:08.785
and then she'd start crying
and leave the room

22:08.869 --> 22:11.038
before we could finish
what we were fighting about.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.875
And so, at school, one of you made
some move, some gesture or...

22:16.335 --> 22:19.004
Yeah, one day I was in the lounge,
and she walked in, and...

22:20.130 --> 22:22.257
she walked up to me
and just put her hand on my arm,

22:22.341 --> 22:24.634
just the tiniest, tiniest gesture.

22:25.093 --> 22:27.637
And I remember it was tax time.
It was the middle of April.

22:27.721 --> 22:32.017
And I was doing our taxes,
and I went to mail them that night,

22:32.100 --> 22:34.352
and as I went by her house,
for no good reason,

22:34.436 --> 22:37.147
she looked up and saw me
through the window.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.398
And that's how it started?

22:38.857 --> 22:41.568
On Tax Day. Strange, isn't it?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.781
Well, these things happen
in all kinds of ways.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.286
And then, I left Diane and Holly

22:51.369 --> 22:53.330
and I moved in
with Tamara and her daughter,

22:53.413 --> 22:54.831
and her husband moved out.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.125
And then?

23:00.670 --> 23:03.298
Well, we got along for a couple of weeks.
I mean...

23:04.299 --> 23:05.884
And...

23:06.927 --> 23:08.095
God, she was beautiful.

23:08.178 --> 23:12.349
And she had... the most beautiful
brown eyes and skin like satin.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.934
- And she was...
- How did it end?

23:14.017 --> 23:15.811
- Huh?
- How did it end?

23:16.895 --> 23:19.940
I was having supper,
me, Tamara and her daughter,

23:20.690 --> 23:23.235
and I suddenly got sick of myself.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.279
I thought, "What am I doing?

23:26.363 --> 23:28.824
I'm trying to play a father
to Tamara's daughter,

23:28.907 --> 23:31.701
and my daughter is growing up without me."

23:31.785 --> 23:32.785
So...

23:34.329 --> 23:35.329
How'd she take it?

23:35.664 --> 23:36.665
She cried.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.709
And...

23:40.710 --> 23:42.921
she said, "Is this our last night?"

23:45.090 --> 23:47.676
I remember that night, how... how it was.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.345
You never talked to her again?

23:50.428 --> 23:51.428
No.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.435
I think you're still in love with her.

23:58.436 --> 24:01.148
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, well, it sounds like it.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.946
Maybe a little bit with the memory of her,
but that's... that's different.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.493
Come on, get in bed.

24:14.077 --> 24:15.077
Yeah.

24:40.979 --> 24:45.650
You know, I think I regret hurting Tamara
more than I regret hurting my own wife.

24:46.234 --> 24:49.404
It's like I failed my spirit or something.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.785
Or I missed a special kind of call
to be something more.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.956
Oh, don't be so hard on yourself, Louis.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.583
You did the right thing.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.127
You're a good man.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.797
I... I don't know about that.

25:08.798 --> 25:12.177
You were a good teacher to Gene.
I remember.

25:14.638 --> 25:18.016
A good one, maybe, but not a great one.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.352
I know that.

25:22.979 --> 25:26.566
Like he's your buddy, and he knows
you know something he don't know.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.195
He knows every goddamn thing
you know, trust me, bud, we all do.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.197
Good morning, boys.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.451
- How you doing, Louis?
- Oh, good enough.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.119
- All right.
- Good morning, sir.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.830
- You look great, Louis.
- Oh, thanks.

25:40.914 --> 25:43.500
- You get a good night's sleep?
- Yeah, how about you?

25:43.583 --> 25:47.337
- Ah, tossing and turning, you know.
- Oh, sorry to hear that.

25:50.924 --> 25:54.844
Yeah, we've heard
you've been pretty busy, for sure.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.349
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Well, that's the word anyway.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.351
How's the bad back?

26:01.434 --> 26:04.396
Uh, it's still a bit sore,
but it's okay, I guess.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.564
Uh-huh.

26:06.314 --> 26:08.275
I bet it is.

26:10.777 --> 26:11.777
How's that?

26:13.154 --> 26:16.866
Well, we gotta compliment you...

26:17.867 --> 26:19.202
on your energy.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.913
Yes, sir.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.749
We all wish we had your energy.

26:30.297 --> 26:32.632
Well, it's been... it's been fun.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.426
- Oh, come on.
- Where you going?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.720
Sit down, Louis.
We're just getting started.

26:36.803 --> 26:37.929
Finish your coffee.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.098
Oh, I think I understand.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.975
- Come on!
- Where you going?

26:42.058 --> 26:44.811
- No need to rush off.
- Come on, it's just us!

26:45.937 --> 26:47.814
You got a whole day to mope.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.409
Are you all right?

27:01.369 --> 27:02.369
Yeah.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.292
You sure?

27:09.419 --> 27:10.419
Yeah.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.551
- Oh, let me get it.
- No, thanks.

27:32.525 --> 27:34.736
You gonna need
to get some groceries after?

27:36.946 --> 27:39.574
It's not like I have anyone else
to cook for.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.551
I was gonna tell you, you know.

28:03.681 --> 28:06.017
I see him leave sometimes in the morning.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.104
Guess others do, too.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.111
It's not what you think.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.697
- It's not?
- No.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.703
Well, in that case, I'm insulted.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.206
Not even dead yet,
and you're already replacing me.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.502
You are irreplaceable.
You know that.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.962
Uh-huh.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.762
What do you think of him?

28:44.180 --> 28:45.640
He seems all right.

28:47.767 --> 28:50.103
Mows my lawn from time to time.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.232
Shovels the walk when it snows.

28:55.608 --> 28:59.237
Well, that's nice. Huh?

29:01.823 --> 29:02.949
But he's no saint.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.954
I could tell you about that.
His wife could've told you.

29:08.037 --> 29:09.664
Oh, that won't be necessary.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.544
We all have history.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.589
That we do, that we do.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.779
Oh.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.915
- So I guess we're not a secret anymore.
- How's that?

29:53.166 --> 29:54.459
You know Dorlan Becker?

29:55.585 --> 29:57.629
Bald guy, used to own the men's store.

29:57.712 --> 29:58.922
- Why?
- Yeah.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.299
Yeah, he's... he's, um...

30:02.467 --> 30:05.386
He's one of the guys I meet with,
uh, down at the coffee shop.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.722
- He's a real piece of work.
- Uh-huh.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.060
Well, anyway, he wanted to know
how come I had so much energy.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.143
What?

30:14.270 --> 30:17.232
I said he wanted to know
how come I had so much energy.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.901
What's so funny?

30:19.984 --> 30:21.319
What'd you tell him?

30:21.986 --> 30:23.321
Well, I... I got mad.

30:24.739 --> 30:27.867
I don't think I handled it very well.
In fact, I think I'm still mad.

30:27.951 --> 30:29.452
Yeah, I can see.

30:38.002 --> 30:41.089
So, Louis, what's the problem?

30:41.172 --> 30:43.716
Well, I don't want anybody
to think anything bad.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.176
- Anything bad?
- Yeah.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.053
- Like what?
- About you or about us.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.555
Oh.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.890
Let it go, Louis.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.726
We always knew people would find out.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.479
Who cares?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.696
Are you over it yet?

31:05.154 --> 31:06.948
I'm getting there.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.540
So I've been thinking.

31:59.542 --> 32:00.627
I've got this idea.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.252
I'm listening.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.422
Why don't we go into town, have lunch...

32:05.548 --> 32:07.342
just take our time and enjoy ourselves?

32:08.259 --> 32:10.553
- In public?
- Yeah.

32:16.017 --> 32:17.352
When do you want to do it?

32:18.937 --> 32:21.022
Sunday. About noon?

32:22.065 --> 32:23.399
Sounds fine to me.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.030
Maybe I'll wear something bright
and flashy.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.176
Hi.

32:55.139 --> 32:57.183
- Hi, Charlie.
- Louis, how are you?

32:57.266 --> 32:59.394
- Okay.
- Sir.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.774
Your server will be right with you.

33:04.857 --> 33:07.068
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.330
Doesn't seem too revolutionary so far.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.773
It was a very hot summer evening.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.697
And Connie had the hose on
with one of those...

33:47.775 --> 33:49.819
Remember those old-fashioned
sprinkler heads?

33:49.902 --> 33:51.946
- Yeah, right.
- That the kids could jump

33:52.030 --> 33:53.906
through the spray, you know, and...

33:56.200 --> 33:58.453
Gene was five at the time.
Connie was 11.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.790
And he was chasing her
around the yard with the hose,

34:02.874 --> 34:07.086
and they were laughing
and screaming and...

34:12.091 --> 34:14.927
And I went inside to check on dinner.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.764
I was making tomato soup.

34:21.809 --> 34:24.896
And I heard the screech of car tires

34:24.978 --> 34:28.399
and, uh, a thud and a scream,

34:28.483 --> 34:30.193
and I ran outside and...

34:38.534 --> 34:40.453
Uh, the driver was standing
next to his car,

34:40.536 --> 34:42.538
and he kept saying, "Oh, God. Oh, God."

34:42.621 --> 34:43.998
It was...

34:46.958 --> 34:51.047
I don't know who called the ambulance,
but it got there pretty quick.

34:58.805 --> 35:00.264
She was still alive.

35:02.725 --> 35:04.018
My little girl.

35:08.481 --> 35:12.276
And we rode to the hospital,
and I held her head in my lap.

35:18.574 --> 35:20.618
Two days later, she was buried.

35:22.411 --> 35:24.372
Her body was buried.

35:24.455 --> 35:26.833
And I don't remember anything else
about that time.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.502
I don't remember
Gene going back to school.

35:29.585 --> 35:32.213
I don't remember Carl going back to work.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.845
But things were never the same between us.

35:40.847 --> 35:44.767
Never. Our relationship, our marriage...

35:44.851 --> 35:46.644
In what way?

35:48.479 --> 35:50.940
Just in every way possible. It was...

35:52.525 --> 35:54.235
I don't know. We stopped talking.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.779
We stopped being intimate.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.074
It's tough for a marriage to survive that.

36:02.368 --> 36:05.121
You know, you wake up one morning,
and you have everything.

36:05.204 --> 36:06.873
Then the next morning it's all gone.

36:08.457 --> 36:13.838
That's how fast it can happen,
just like that, in an instant, you know?

36:47.330 --> 36:51.000
- You two aren't fighting again...
- No, Mom, come on.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.842
She can't keep doing this, Gene.
It's not right.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.510
- Mom...
- And it's not good for him.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.431
Mom, it's not what you think it is.
We don't have a problem, okay?

37:05.514 --> 37:08.643
Just... Just take him for a couple of days,
that's all I'm asking. Help me out.

37:10.811 --> 37:11.896
Take him?

37:11.979 --> 37:15.107
Yeah, until Bev comes back
or he goes back to school in September.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.987
She's not gonna just go
and leave her son, is she?

37:20.071 --> 37:21.447
No, Ma.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.158
No. No. She's not.

37:26.827 --> 37:28.746
Of course I'll take him.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.378
How's your shop?

37:37.380 --> 37:38.839
It was wonderful. I lost it.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.513
You know, nobody's buying unpainted
furniture nowadays,

37:45.596 --> 37:47.431
and... and I can't help it, you know?

37:48.474 --> 37:51.602
Yeah. So what are you gonna do?

37:55.523 --> 37:56.983
Uh...

37:57.066 --> 37:58.567
I'll, uh... I'll figure it out.

38:02.154 --> 38:03.531
You need money?

38:09.954 --> 38:10.954
No.

38:15.668 --> 38:18.629
I'll see you soon.
All right, now, give me a hug.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.926
You're gonna be all right, okay?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.014
All right, now go inside.

38:28.681 --> 38:30.308
She's waiting for you, come on.

38:46.782 --> 38:48.242
Come on, go inside.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.831
Go on. Jamie, go up.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.043
Come on, we're gonna have a good time.

39:02.131 --> 39:05.426
I guess that's it for us, then.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.219
Well, it... it doesn't have to be.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.513
You don't think?

39:09.597 --> 39:11.390
I don't know. Let's see how it goes.

39:11.474 --> 39:15.895
Heck, I might need you
to help me with him, actually.

39:18.105 --> 39:21.192
Been quite a stretch
since I took care of a seven-year-old.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.986
Yeah, you and me both.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.082
Jamie, hi.

39:46.509 --> 39:48.094
How are things at home?

39:48.803 --> 39:49.803
Uh...

39:51.722 --> 39:55.309
Well, we're gonna have a good time,
you and me, okay?

39:56.143 --> 39:58.020
Okay, so let's go to bed now.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.731
- Nana?
- Yeah?

40:00.815 --> 40:02.483
Can I sleep in your room?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.113
Sure.

40:17.581 --> 40:19.125
Pretty good cupcakes.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.720
Try.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.935
Hey, Jamie, how do you like school?

40:48.112 --> 40:50.448
What's that game you're playing
on your phone?

40:50.531 --> 40:52.783
- It's called Clash of Clans.
- It's called what?

40:52.867 --> 40:55.369
- Clash of Clans.
- Clash of Clans.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.956
- How's it work?
- You build a city and then, like,

40:59.039 --> 41:01.542
- watch it grow and stuff.
- Huh.

41:08.174 --> 41:12.178
Hey, you want to see something cool?

41:15.514 --> 41:16.514
Hello?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.310
What?

41:22.646 --> 41:23.646
I'll show you.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.193
See, I think...

41:31.071 --> 41:32.406
I...

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
Yep.

41:39.955 --> 41:40.998
Here it is.

41:42.791 --> 41:46.462
This is the engine
that pulls the rest of the train.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.464
And...

41:50.549 --> 41:53.761
Oh, and this is the freight car.
It comes right behind it.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.433
And this is the caboose,
which comes at the end.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.896
- Where'd you buy them?
- Hmm?

42:03.979 --> 42:05.481
Where'd you buy them?

42:05.564 --> 42:09.151
Uh, I got them from a mail order,
got them from mail order...

42:11.779 --> 42:14.823
And it was coming...
It was a big box with instructions in it.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.451
And it came all the way from Tennessee.

42:18.244 --> 42:21.830
And then my daughter and I
put this thing together,

42:22.581 --> 42:24.708
and, boy, it took weeks to build it.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.085
Wow.

42:27.461 --> 42:28.963
Can I play with them?

42:29.046 --> 42:32.132
Yes, as long as it's okay
with your grandmother.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.634
If you're careful.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.596
I put bad guys on the train,
and they were, like, robbing the train,

42:37.680 --> 42:41.100
and then I had good guys, like,
come out and push them off the train.

42:41.183 --> 42:42.935
And then I used paper towels...

42:43.018 --> 42:46.230
I stuffed paper towels on the train
to make it look like smoke.

42:47.523 --> 42:49.650
Oh, that sounds like a fun day.

42:52.736 --> 42:54.113
Oh, can I play with my phone now?

42:55.281 --> 42:56.448
Mm...

42:57.199 --> 42:58.659
For a half hour.

43:00.119 --> 43:01.495
Not at the table.

43:03.497 --> 43:05.082
Ask to be excused.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.501
- May I please be excused?
- Yes. Oh.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.506
Baby steps.

43:17.428 --> 43:19.138
- Well, hello again.
- Hi!

43:19.221 --> 43:21.056
Where... Where's Addie?

43:21.140 --> 43:24.977
She said I could come by myself.
Are you bringing the train set out today?

43:25.894 --> 43:27.521
Well, I guess I could... I could poss...

43:29.565 --> 43:30.566
Okay, then.

43:33.944 --> 43:34.987
Cool.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.739
- Okay?
- Got it.

43:36.822 --> 43:40.826
Now, you're gonna hook these up,
and then...

43:41.368 --> 43:43.454
- Careful, easy.
- Wait.

43:43.537 --> 43:45.914
- There you go.
- Connected.

43:47.916 --> 43:52.171
You know, when I was a kid,
they'd try to sell you cereal to eat.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.589
- Mm-hmm.
- And so what they'd do,

43:53.672 --> 43:55.716
they'd put a prize
at the bottom of the cereal box,

43:55.799 --> 43:57.384
a little prize, like a ring?

43:57.468 --> 43:59.637
Like a Captain Midnight ring
or something like that.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.554
Mm-hmm.

44:00.638 --> 44:03.849
And you'd plow through the cereal
to get to the prize.

44:03.932 --> 44:06.560
You didn't like the cereal,
'cause it wasn't very good anyway,

44:06.644 --> 44:09.124
but you couldn't wait to get the prize,
then you got your ring.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.773
Okay, now, what's next?

44:11.148 --> 44:14.234
Pulling the train along. And go.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.112
Don't you think the train
needs to go through a town?

44:17.196 --> 44:18.989
- Well, yeah.
- See, here's the town.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.491
- Cool.
- Okay.

44:20.574 --> 44:23.327
Wow. Oh, wow, this is a big house.

44:23.410 --> 44:25.788
Well, somebody's got...
Ooh, somebody's very rich.

44:25.871 --> 44:28.624
- Oh, how about a church?
- Oh, yeah, you've got to have a church.

44:28.707 --> 44:30.959
Yeah, what's a town without a church?

44:32.211 --> 44:34.588
There you go.

44:36.548 --> 44:38.133
Now you're talking.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.389
You know, my mom was five when
they first put the streetlights in Holt.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.226
There were many more flowers
on Main Street then.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.396
Where'd they go?

44:51.605 --> 44:53.107
Well, 'cause of the moths.

44:53.190 --> 44:56.151
The moths would pollinate the flowers,
and then because of the lights,

44:56.235 --> 44:58.153
they would go higher up,
away from the flowers.

44:59.071 --> 45:03.075
So why don't they make the lights lower,
like at my height?

45:03.158 --> 45:04.410
I don't know.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.995
That's an idea.

45:08.580 --> 45:10.707
- Hi, Nana.
- Jamie.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.171
Will you wash up for dinner?

45:17.005 --> 45:17.881
- Okay.
- Okay.

45:17.965 --> 45:21.468
- Can I have a sleepover?
- Yeah, sure.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.137
With Louis, too?

45:26.890 --> 45:29.226
Sure.

45:32.896 --> 45:34.064
Mm-kay.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.235
Out like a light.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.030
You're good with kids.

45:46.201 --> 45:48.370
Nana!

46:00.591 --> 46:02.259
What's the matter, honey?

46:05.762 --> 46:07.973
Okay. Come here.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.226
Don't forget Mister Monkey.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.813
Here you go. Okay, here we go.

46:16.982 --> 46:18.233
What are you doing?

46:19.610 --> 46:21.487
- I don't...
- Stay.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.490
Stay. Come on, get in.

46:36.668 --> 46:37.668
Okay.

46:39.296 --> 46:43.717
- I'm gonna turn the light off, all right?
- Okay.

46:47.095 --> 46:48.722
I'm scared.

46:49.681 --> 46:53.519
Oh, honey,
there's nothing to be scared of.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.898
Look, I'll hold your hand, okay?

46:59.441 --> 47:01.026
I'm still scared.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.699
Oh!

47:50.534 --> 47:53.203
We're down a run,
but the top of the order is coming up,

47:53.287 --> 47:55.038
and that's where the best hitters are.

47:58.625 --> 47:59.625
You ever seen a game?

48:01.003 --> 48:02.170
You haven't? You ever play?

48:12.848 --> 48:15.726
Whoo! Go! Whoo! Go!

48:15.809 --> 48:17.269
She is so good.

48:17.352 --> 48:19.688
- She's good, yeah.
- She just always has been.

48:21.148 --> 48:22.148
So...

48:24.860 --> 48:26.903
Does he still come by at night?

48:29.656 --> 48:32.117
We don't do anything,
if that's what you're thinking.

48:34.286 --> 48:35.912
- No?
- No!

48:41.376 --> 48:42.711
The hell you waiting for?

48:45.172 --> 48:46.798
The hell you waiting for?

48:46.882 --> 48:49.968
- I'm just rattling you.
- No, it's not what it's about.

48:53.138 --> 48:55.599
When I was a kid,
there was nothing more important

48:55.682 --> 48:57.893
than wanting to chase something
and catch it.

48:57.976 --> 48:58.976
Yes.

48:59.019 --> 49:01.313
I was always looking
for something to chase.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.815
- Here you go.
- But, you know...

49:04.691 --> 49:06.943
it breaks my heart
to see how lonely he is.

49:09.529 --> 49:10.906
Mm.

49:10.989 --> 49:11.907
You know what he needs?

49:11.990 --> 49:14.868
I think he needs some real friends
to play with,

49:14.951 --> 49:17.412
instead of us doddering old folks.

49:17.496 --> 49:19.539
- "Doddering"?
- Yeah.

49:21.249 --> 49:22.876
- Hey...
- Huh? Yeah?

49:24.044 --> 49:25.379
How about a dog?

49:27.255 --> 49:29.174
I'm serious.
There's a shelter in Phillips.

49:29.257 --> 49:30.300
We could drive up there.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.928
I don't have energy for a puppy.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.596
I'm not talking about a puppy.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.974
I'm talking about a dog,
like a real full-fledged dog.

49:38.058 --> 49:40.310
House-trained and everything.

49:43.355 --> 49:45.190
You can keep it at my house.

49:46.358 --> 49:47.693
Sounds like you want a dog.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.254
Oh...

50:10.257 --> 50:11.591
Oh, this one looks nice.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.011
- You want to see her?
- Yes, please.

50:22.227 --> 50:23.520
Come on, girl.

50:26.106 --> 50:27.649
So what... what happened here?

50:28.984 --> 50:34.740
She was left outside during the winter,
so the vet had to amputate her toes.

50:34.823 --> 50:35.991
Oh.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.785
- What are you going to call her?
- Bonny.

50:40.454 --> 50:41.830
Where'd you get that name?

50:43.999 --> 50:45.500
A girl in my class.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.337
Okay, Bonny it is.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.468
Can we visit her again after dinner?

50:56.553 --> 50:59.598
Yeah. You can have a short visit
to say good night.

51:03.185 --> 51:04.185
Okay?

51:30.921 --> 51:32.798
Okay, get the damn dog.

51:32.881 --> 51:35.592
Yeah, you don't want it waking up
the whole neighborhood.

51:35.675 --> 51:38.094
I said get the darn dog.

51:51.566 --> 51:53.652
Did you have this in mind all along?

51:54.528 --> 51:57.072
I'm not that smart.

52:02.327 --> 52:03.327
So...

52:05.413 --> 52:08.125
Talk to me. Tell me something
I don't know about you yet.

52:09.209 --> 52:11.294
Hey, you know that dog's
on the bed with him?

52:12.212 --> 52:13.046
I know.

52:13.129 --> 52:15.465
Well, it's going to get your bed
awfully dirty.

52:15.549 --> 52:16.675
I'll wash it.

52:18.718 --> 52:19.718
Talk to me.

52:24.516 --> 52:25.976
I wanted to be an artist.

52:28.770 --> 52:31.273
I had this crazy idea
that I could be a painter someday.

52:31.356 --> 52:33.483
I didn't tell anyone. Diane knew.

52:39.322 --> 52:41.992
And I had it all mapped out.
I was gonna save money.

52:42.075 --> 52:44.953
- Mm-hmm.
- I was gonna sail to Europe and paint.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.581
I even had a teacher draw up
a recommendation

52:47.664 --> 52:49.332
for a student visa for me.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.668
And what happened?

52:53.336 --> 52:55.380
- You mean why didn't I pursue it?
- Yeah.

52:57.382 --> 52:58.382
Um...

53:01.678 --> 53:05.181
Well, I thought I had a...
I'd get a teaching certificate first,

53:05.265 --> 53:07.684
and then... then I met Diane.

53:08.685 --> 53:12.606
And, uh, then we got married,
and when Holly came along,

53:12.689 --> 53:14.149
uh, I was already teaching.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.110
And also spending my summers
building houses

53:17.193 --> 53:19.362
because I thought we needed
more money.

53:22.032 --> 53:25.368
I remember you fixing houses
with other teachers.

53:26.703 --> 53:27.703

Then you... go back like this.

57:25.024 --> 57:27.819
And then when you go to throw,
you step forward with that foot.

57:27.902 --> 57:29.195
- There you go.
- Like this?

57:29.279 --> 57:31.698
- Yeah, but wait until I get there, okay?
- Okay.

57:34.075 --> 57:35.075
Let's have it.

57:40.165 --> 57:41.166
Try it again.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.669
You don't understand.
You could be looser, you know?

57:44.752 --> 57:45.795
You...

57:45.879 --> 57:48.298
- Just step forward and throw.
- Okay.

57:48.381 --> 57:49.382
Okay?

57:53.011 --> 57:54.304
There you go.

57:54.387 --> 57:57.682
Ooh! Hey, strike.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.311
Here you go.

58:01.394 --> 58:03.480
Jamie, this is for you.
This is nice and sharp.

58:03.563 --> 58:04.647
Okay.

58:06.524 --> 58:08.735
- Okay? Got it?
- And here's one to eat.

58:08.818 --> 58:10.904
Hoo-hoo! Wow.

58:10.987 --> 58:12.906
Don't eat them all.
Save something for me.

58:12.989 --> 58:15.241
Louis, you want a marshmallow?

58:15.325 --> 58:17.285
- Huh?
- You want a marshmallow?

58:17.368 --> 58:20.288
- Is that yours?
- Well, you can have it.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.083
You're gonna love it. Don't you?

58:25.752 --> 58:27.420
I haven't seen your phone all day.

58:28.379 --> 58:30.131
Well, I left it at home because Louis said

58:30.215 --> 58:33.009
it probably wouldn't get connection
in the mountains.

58:33.092 --> 58:35.428
Okay, let's see how it tastes.
Are you ready?

58:35.512 --> 58:36.971
All right, try it.

58:38.139 --> 58:39.139
Mm. Gosh.

58:39.849 --> 58:42.101
It tastes really good.

58:42.185 --> 58:45.355
The marshmallow has actually been cooked.

58:48.942 --> 58:51.110
You know,
we're in that tent right over here.

58:51.194 --> 58:53.488
If you need us, just call, okay?

58:53.571 --> 58:55.406
I love you, Nana.

58:55.490 --> 58:56.950
Good night, sweetheart.

59:16.344 --> 59:18.137
You're awfully quiet, Louis.

59:21.057 --> 59:22.392
Well, I was just thinking.

59:24.894 --> 59:27.689
You know, we used to come here
all the time, just the two of us.

59:27.772 --> 59:28.982
- You and Diane?
- Uh-huh.

59:31.901 --> 59:33.570
We'd come when she was able.

59:38.533 --> 59:41.119
She fought hard, did... didn't she?

59:42.328 --> 59:43.997
Yeah, in the beginning, she did.

59:45.540 --> 59:47.834
But in the end,
there wasn't much fight left.

59:50.545 --> 59:54.173
I would sit with her during the day,
and I would bring her food,

59:54.257 --> 59:55.883
and I would try to get her to eat.

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.930
But at the same time, we weren't really
talking to each other anymore, and I...

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:07.395
I think she was basically just saying,
"I'm... I'm done with it."

01:00:08.896 --> 01:00:11.941
You know, we... we always think
we can fix everything, but...

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.653
some things we can't fix.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.073
We have to learn to forgive ourselves.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:23.286
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, but that's not it.

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:28.082
You know, I mean, Holly and I were there
when she passed.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:31.544
I remember...

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.214
wanting to feel her leave...

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:37.967
her spirit or something.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.058
And instead, it just seems
like she's still around.

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.731
You can tell me anything. You know that.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.546
Look, I'm gonna put this on you.
Yes!

01:01:56.629 --> 01:01:58.005
Now that we're back home,

01:01:58.089 --> 01:02:00.299
I'm telling you,
you're gonna miss that mountain air.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:02.135
- Yeah.
- Come on, girl.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:05.638
You know, I think I've decided
I really like altitude.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.265
- Hey, big guy.
- Yeah?

01:02:08.599 --> 01:02:09.684
- Hi.
- Gene.

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:11.936
Oh, so you got him a dog, huh?

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:16.274
Bonny. Louis got her for him.
You know Louis Waters.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:17.525
Yes. Hello, Gene.

01:02:17.608 --> 01:02:18.608
Hi, Mr. Waters.

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:21.946
I've been trying to call you all day.
Where were you?

01:02:24.365 --> 01:02:26.205
You know,
I should be getting back to my place.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.952
- Would you call me later?
- Yeah.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:31.164
- Okay.
- Bye, Jamie.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.166
- Bye. Thank you.
- Good to see you again, Gene.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:39.464
We went camping.

01:02:40.214 --> 01:02:41.674
- It was really fun.
- It was.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.509
- Oh, really? Yeah, you had fun?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.928
- It was good?
- Roasted marshmallows.

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.431
Jamie really liked that.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.350
Yeah, it was neat.

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.398
Louis Waters, really?

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.944
Can we talk about this later?

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:04.989
Uh, can I take Bonny on a walk?

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:08.910
Yeah, yeah, sure you can.

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:13.581
I know what he did to his family.
I was here, remember?

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:16.292
- That was 40 years ago.
- Yeah, well, it still happened.

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:18.795
He destroyed a family.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:22.173
He's sorry that he did it, okay?

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:25.468
And he can't fix it now, so...

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:28.638
Can I ask you something?

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:31.891
I heard he sleeps over.

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:34.393
Do you really think that's okay?

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.270
I don't see
how that is any of your business.

01:03:36.354 --> 01:03:38.773
Well, it is my business
if my kid is involved.

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:41.400
It is my business.

01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:43.561
I don't want him to get hurt.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:47.198
Oh, you don't think he was already hurt
with Bev running off this summer?

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:52.078
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.080
I'm sorry.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:56.248
Yeah.

01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:04.382
How's everything with Beverly now?
And your work?

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.801
Work is fine.

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.345
Work is fine.

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:17.436
I'm fixing roofs.

01:04:23.484 --> 01:04:28.114
Well, you know, I'd like to help you
if there's any way I can...

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:31.826
Mom, I'm not asking you for anything.
Really, please.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.539
Hey, Bonny.

01:04:38.082 --> 01:04:39.792
Why were you yelling?

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:42.795
I wasn't yelling.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:50.136
Hey, come here.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.807
What do you say? Let's go home.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:58.203
- Will Mommy be there?
- No. Mom's not gonna be there.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.104
She... She'll come soon, okay?

01:05:00.187 --> 01:05:02.523
Just the two of us. All right? Look at me.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:05.359
We're gonna have a lot of fun. All right?

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:10.990
I... I don't want to go home.
I want to stay here with Nana.

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:19.415
Honey, it's just your daddy
misses you, you know?

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:20.541
Come on.

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.002
I want to stay here with you.

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:28.925
And remember her neck.
You're gonna have to be gentle.

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:36.015
And you're going to be good. I can tell.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.184
Now, you call me, okay?

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:41.187
I want to know how school is going.
I want to know how you are.

01:05:42.396 --> 01:05:44.565
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:50.363
- You too, bud.
- Sorry, but we really need to go.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.448
All right, you put her
in the car, all right?

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.326
- Be patient.
- Yeah.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.662
- Good-bye, Gene.
- Good-bye.

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.793
Put on your seat belt.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.547
Bye!

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:08.839
Bye!

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:41.706
You know, I feel it, too.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:42.873
The absence.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.878
But at least he's got the dog with him.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.338
Yeah.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.927
The dog was a good idea.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:57.430
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:01.182
Hey.

01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:04.729
I've got another idea.

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:10.401
You ever been to the Brown Palace?

01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:13.654
- In Denver?
- Yeah.

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:16.532
Yeah, I've always wanted to stay there.

01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:21.787
What do you think? Just the two of us?

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.708
Get away for a few days,
get our minds off of things?

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:29.628
God, I haven't been in the city for ages.

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:11.378
Here you go. Enjoy your stay.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:15.341
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.426
Hi.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.678
Louis Waters.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.782
Welcome to the Brown Palace Hotel,
Mr. Waters.

01:08:21.805 --> 01:08:23.933
- Thank you.
- Mrs. Waters.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:31.564
Uh...

01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:34.567
Here you go.

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.716
Shall we?

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.051
