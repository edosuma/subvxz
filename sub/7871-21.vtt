00:25.719 --> 00:28.035
It's been a brilliant night
of women's tennis

00:28.186 --> 00:31.155
with Petrevkova
narrowly edging Mashakova.

00:31.189 --> 00:32.973
<i>We take you now</i>
<i>to doubles action</i>

00:33.007 --> 00:35.659
<i>between</i>
<i>Pavlyuchenkeka-Vilnikova</i>

00:35.693 --> 00:38.995
<i>and Strakova-Mishtnupetrateva.</i>

00:39.013 --> 00:42.649
To me, it's legs versus boobs.

00:43.818 --> 00:45.335
What the...?

00:45.370 --> 00:46.603
Change the channel?

00:46.638 --> 00:48.889
But I'm watching
soft-core tennis.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.574
<i>Ki-Ya Karate Monsters!</i>

00:50.608 --> 00:52.392
What the hell
is that?

00:52.427 --> 00:53.660
It's our favorite show.

00:53.695 --> 00:55.245
Mom said we
could watch it.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.747
Did she really say that?

00:56.781 --> 00:58.749
Are you gonna walk upstairs
and ask her?

01:05.757 --> 01:07.574
No.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.326
From a Shaolin monastery

01:09.360 --> 01:11.862
in darkest Transylvania
come helpful hell-spawn.

01:11.880 --> 01:16.500
With homicidal honor,
they rampage for peace.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.835
Ki-Ya!

01:17.869 --> 01:19.019
Ki-Ya!
Ki-Ya!

01:19.053 --> 01:20.587
You like this now?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.006
What about <i>Planet Jackson</i>
<i>and the Earth Brigade?</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.675
Dad, we don't watch
that show anymore.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.810
It's for babies.

01:29.481 --> 01:31.965
Planet power!

01:33.251 --> 01:35.619
Kung Fu Werewolf chop!
Blob Jitsu kick!

01:35.653 --> 01:39.055
Stop it. No Karate Monsters
at the dinner table.

01:39.073 --> 01:41.608
It's <i>Ki-Ya</i> Karate Monsters.

01:41.659 --> 01:43.861
Samurai shampoo
blast!

01:43.895 --> 01:45.579
Ninja throwing soap!

01:45.613 --> 01:48.248
No Karate Monsters
in the bathtub.

01:48.283 --> 01:50.817
<i>Ki-Ya</i>
Karate Monsters.

01:50.852 --> 01:52.986
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Happy birthday, Grampa.

01:54.923 --> 01:56.957
Did this really happen?

01:56.991 --> 01:59.560
Pill attack!
Actual sword attack!

01:59.594 --> 02:02.646
I've had it.
No more Karate Monsters.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.465
Ki-Ya...  Ki-Ya...

02:05.500 --> 02:08.251
That's it. Tomorrow, we're doing
something educational.

02:08.269 --> 02:10.586
We're going
to the science museum.

02:11.623 --> 02:13.257
Damn it.

02:29.123 --> 02:31.959
Finally,
actual science.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.664
You did it, baby.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.234
You promised no fun,
and you delivered.

02:45.773 --> 02:47.574
Ah, hello there.

02:47.609 --> 02:51.745
I am Blaise Pascal, inventor
of the probability theory.

02:51.779 --> 02:55.265
What are the <i>odds</i>
of meeting you here?

02:55.299 --> 02:57.651
Excellent, I would say.

02:58.686 --> 03:00.087
My friend Silly Squirrel

03:00.121 --> 03:02.489
is about to buy
a lottery ticket.

03:02.523 --> 03:05.158
Silly Squirrel, do you
know the probability

03:05.193 --> 03:06.994
of winning the lottery?

03:07.028 --> 03:08.161
I don't know.

03:08.196 --> 03:09.863
Why, you are more likely

03:09.897 --> 03:12.516
to be run over by a car.

03:12.550 --> 03:15.869
Or be hit by lightning.

03:15.903 --> 03:19.273
Or murdered by
an acquaintance.

03:19.307 --> 03:21.875
If you understood
probability,

03:21.909 --> 03:24.878
you would never
play the lottery.

03:28.383 --> 03:30.350
Guys, this science exhibit

03:30.385 --> 03:32.636
told me how stupid it is
to play the lottery.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.888
Whoa, whoa, whoa. So you didn't
buy our weekly ticket?

03:34.922 --> 03:37.691
Are you nuts? You can't win
if you don't play.

03:37.725 --> 03:40.343
Hey, it's time.
Turn it on, turn it on!

03:40.361 --> 03:43.413
Four lucky numbers
for four best friends.

03:43.448 --> 03:44.665
Yeah, I always
go with three,

03:44.699 --> 03:46.550
the number of brothers
and sisters

03:46.584 --> 03:48.802
I, uh, <i>Hunger Games-ed</i>
in the womb.

03:48.836 --> 03:52.222
19 for me. Uh, for the
best year of my life, 1996.

03:52.256 --> 03:53.740
My number's 22.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.426
No reason. Just... 22.

03:56.461 --> 03:57.995
And I'm 69.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.981
Because people always laugh
when you say "69."

04:02.450 --> 04:03.850
No one knows why.

04:03.885 --> 04:05.485
And the winning numbers are...

04:05.520 --> 04:07.487
three, 19,

04:07.522 --> 04:09.656
22 and 69.

04:11.092 --> 04:12.859
Oh, my gosh.
We won.

04:12.894 --> 04:14.594
We won the
Springfield Lottery.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.781
That's 200 grand.
That's 50,000 bucks each!

04:20.401 --> 04:22.936
Guys, guys, we got to celebrate,
throw a raging party!

04:22.987 --> 04:25.539
I'll cash the ticket.
Homer, Homer, you get the food.

04:25.573 --> 04:28.859
I'll get mini Dumpsters of wings
from Garbage Wings.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.060
And, Lenny, you
get the drinks.

04:30.078 --> 04:31.695
But we're already
at a bar.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.931
Oh, no. That's just gasoline
and hot dog water.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.867
Who cares?
We got the money.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.969
I'm so happy.

04:39.003 --> 04:40.971
I'm so happy.

04:41.005 --> 04:43.607
To the best feeling
in the world...

04:43.641 --> 04:44.641
money.

04:47.512 --> 04:49.946
Guys, I got big plans
for these winnings.

04:49.981 --> 04:53.583
I'm going to build...
a swimming pool.

04:53.618 --> 04:54.751
In-ground?

04:54.786 --> 04:56.953
So freaking far
in the ground, baby.

04:56.988 --> 04:58.622
What about you, Carl?

04:58.656 --> 05:00.656
What are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

05:03.411 --> 05:06.780
Oh, uh, I guess Carl ain't back
yet from cashing in the ticket.

05:06.814 --> 05:08.915
I'm sure he just got
held up in traffic.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.485
Yeah, that's probably
what happened.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.487
I wonder
what's keeping Carl.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.589
I hope our friend
wasn't in an accident.

05:15.623 --> 05:17.257
I'm glad we're the
kind of people

05:17.291 --> 05:18.892
who are worried
about Carl's safety

05:18.926 --> 05:20.994
instead of thinking
that he ripped us off.

05:21.028 --> 05:23.430
I wasn't thinking that.

05:23.464 --> 05:26.333
Carl's our good friend.
Our good friend.

05:26.367 --> 05:27.901
Yeah, good old Carl.

05:29.270 --> 05:32.639
Good old Carl's phone
went straight to voice mail.

05:32.673 --> 05:33.840
Again.

05:36.227 --> 05:39.179
The power of friendship
is so amazing,

05:39.213 --> 05:41.815
I don't feel at all
suspicious of Carl.

05:41.849 --> 05:44.467
Drive faster because
of the power of friendship.

05:48.489 --> 05:50.123
Carl's gone.

05:50.158 --> 05:51.691
Our money's gone.

05:51.726 --> 05:52.926
We've been betrayed.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.594
By good old Carl!

05:54.629 --> 05:56.963
Guys, I think
we might need a new song.

05:56.998 --> 05:58.965
♪ Four best friends

05:59.000 --> 06:01.868
♪ Who never quarrel

06:01.903 --> 06:06.306
♪ Homer Simpson, Lenny,
Moe and... ♪

06:06.340 --> 06:08.141
♪ And...

06:08.176 --> 06:10.177
And no one.

06:12.774 --> 06:14.551
All our lottery
money, gone!

06:14.552 --> 06:16.152
If I ever see that Carl again,

06:16.187 --> 06:18.521
I'm gonna freeze him,
chop him up into ice cubes

06:18.556 --> 06:20.256
and scoop him
into the urinal trough

06:20.291 --> 06:22.192
at the Gathering
of the Juggalos!

06:22.226 --> 06:25.195
Guys, give Carl a chance.
I'm sure he's gonna come back.

06:25.229 --> 06:26.663
I don't think so.

06:26.697 --> 06:29.416
His travel neck pillow's gone
from its pedestal.

06:29.450 --> 06:30.650
Fellas,

06:30.684 --> 06:32.952
he ain't coming back.
You don't know that.

06:32.987 --> 06:35.605
I'm gonna keep looking till we
figure out what really happened.

06:35.639 --> 06:38.241
See, I bet he flew to Quebec
to bring us back

06:38.275 --> 06:40.243
authentic French-Canadian
sugar pie.

06:40.277 --> 06:42.245
I can taste it already.

06:42.279 --> 06:44.747
Mmm. Thanks
for the sugar pie, Carl.

06:46.584 --> 06:48.284
Hey, what's this?

06:48.319 --> 06:50.053
"I've gone home.

06:50.087 --> 06:53.523
Good-bye forever,
Carl Carlson."

06:54.825 --> 06:57.026
Where'd you go, Carl?

06:58.429 --> 07:00.463
Had plans
for that money, too.

07:00.498 --> 07:02.165
I was gonna be
one of those guys

07:02.199 --> 07:04.100
who's really into
hot sauce, you know?

07:04.135 --> 07:06.503
Hot sauce suspenders,
hot sauce pajamas.

07:06.537 --> 07:09.806
Bolo tie with a little
chili pepper on it.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.809
I still can't believe it was
Carl who took your winnings.

07:12.843 --> 07:14.611
I thought it would've been you.

07:14.645 --> 07:16.346
Or you. Or you.

07:16.380 --> 07:17.981
I know. Me, too.

07:18.015 --> 07:19.916
It's the ultimate screw-over.

07:19.950 --> 07:21.317
Maybe he had a good reason

07:21.352 --> 07:23.520
to give you
the ultimate screw-over.

07:23.554 --> 07:26.356
He said he went home,
and his passport is gone.

07:26.390 --> 07:28.424
What country is he from?

07:28.459 --> 07:30.109
Uh... Uh...
I don't know.

07:30.144 --> 07:33.012
You don't know
where Carl is from?

07:33.047 --> 07:35.215
Come on, you know how dudes are.

07:35.249 --> 07:37.183
We don't go digging
into the past.

07:37.218 --> 07:38.852
We talk about guy stuff.

07:38.886 --> 07:40.620
Like baseball and trucks

07:40.654 --> 07:42.121
and when guys lift
too much weight

07:42.156 --> 07:43.456
and their bungus drops out.

07:43.491 --> 07:45.124
You know, guy stuff.

07:45.159 --> 07:47.527
Maybe if you'd talked less
about guy stuff,

07:47.561 --> 07:50.196
you'd know more
about your so-called friend.

07:50.231 --> 07:51.498
Well, it don't matter
no more, Midge.

07:51.532 --> 07:53.066
Carl is gone,

07:53.100 --> 07:54.780
and we're already
auditioning replacements.

07:58.005 --> 08:00.406
This could not be
more offensive.

08:00.441 --> 08:01.674
Man!

08:01.709 --> 08:03.843
Oh, of course.

08:03.878 --> 08:05.545
Ugh!
Hmm.

08:06.981 --> 08:08.515
Hey, hey, get that
out of here!

08:08.549 --> 08:09.983
I don't ever want to see

08:10.017 --> 08:11.618
that moolah-stealing
jackpot thief again!

08:11.652 --> 08:13.386
Wait a minute.

08:13.420 --> 08:17.390
Something's reflected in
the lenses of Carl's sunglasses.

08:17.424 --> 08:19.726
I just need to get closer.

08:22.029 --> 08:25.832
He's looking at a geyser.

08:25.866 --> 08:27.500
And there's a sign
in front of it!

08:27.535 --> 08:30.236
Oh... It's too small to read.

08:32.472 --> 08:34.307
Oh, it's backwards.

08:34.341 --> 08:35.674
Try this.

08:35.708 --> 08:38.745
"Strokkur Geysir."

08:38.779 --> 08:40.712
Hmm.

08:40.748 --> 08:42.448
The geyser is one
of the most famous

08:42.482 --> 08:45.018
natural wonders in Iceland.

08:45.052 --> 08:46.953
I guess that's
where Carl's from.

08:46.987 --> 08:48.221
Ice-land?

08:48.255 --> 08:49.689
Is that even
a real place?

08:49.723 --> 08:51.891
I thought it was
Superman's Superman cave.

08:51.926 --> 08:53.576
Iceland keeps the most detailed
family records

08:53.611 --> 08:56.512
of any country in the world.

08:56.547 --> 08:58.414
There!
Carl was adopted...

09:01.068 --> 09:03.703
...by a couple who lives
outside Reykjavik.

09:03.737 --> 09:04.938
Well, if that's
Carl's home,

09:04.972 --> 09:06.539
then that's where
our money is!

09:06.574 --> 09:08.334
And that's where we're going.
We got to pack.

09:16.634 --> 09:19.235
50 bucks per bag?

09:19.270 --> 09:22.572
I guess I'm only bringing one
guitar on this revenge trip.

09:24.591 --> 09:26.576
You're going so far away.

09:26.610 --> 09:27.810
I'll miss you.

09:27.845 --> 09:29.412
Baby, I'm going for us.

09:29.446 --> 09:31.814
That money is going
to dig us a swimming pool

09:31.849 --> 09:34.484
that'll take our broken family
and make it whole.

09:34.518 --> 09:35.918
We're not broken.

09:35.953 --> 09:37.487
We're broken.
We're pretty broken.

09:38.806 --> 09:40.139
How am I going to sleep

09:40.174 --> 09:41.574
if someone isn't pushing me

09:41.609 --> 09:43.810
all the way to the
very edge of the bed?

09:43.844 --> 09:46.346
I've already taken care of that.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.333
Oh...

09:50.367 --> 09:51.884
Oh, that's perfect.

09:57.491 --> 09:59.926
I can't wait to see the smile
on Carl's face

09:59.960 --> 10:01.160
when we surprise him.

10:01.195 --> 10:02.362
I call first hug.

10:02.396 --> 10:04.097
Hey, Lenny, when are you
gonna wise up?

10:04.131 --> 10:06.432
Carl never wants
to see us again.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.134
I'm done talking to you!

10:10.537 --> 10:12.005
This is funny.

10:12.039 --> 10:16.643
It says here Iceland is green,
and Greenland is icy.

10:16.677 --> 10:19.946
The Vikings switched the names
to trick everybody.

10:21.348 --> 10:22.548
It's funny.
That's pretty good.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.117
Great gag!

10:24.151 --> 10:27.437
Hey, Vikings,
it's still pretty damn cold!

10:27.488 --> 10:30.239
I only packed shorts.

10:36.547 --> 10:37.947
Excuse me, uh,

10:37.981 --> 10:39.215
we're looking for our friend.

10:39.249 --> 10:41.617
He's, uh... he's about so tall,

10:41.652 --> 10:43.386
uh, wears a jacket,

10:43.420 --> 10:46.022
he's, um, got no
visible tattoos...

10:46.056 --> 10:47.957
Just say he's black, Moe.

10:47.991 --> 10:49.192
You say he's black!

10:49.226 --> 10:51.527
His name is Carl Carlson.

10:51.562 --> 10:52.995
Carl Carlson!

10:53.030 --> 10:55.698
His family has been hated
for 1,000 years.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.800
How do you know
about Carl's family?

10:57.835 --> 10:59.802
Our country is very small,

10:59.837 --> 11:02.138
very judgmental and very nosy.

11:02.189 --> 11:05.158
Ingimar Ogmundsson, how
progresses your gonorrhea?

11:05.192 --> 11:08.494
It heals, but slowly.

11:08.529 --> 11:10.463
Why does everybody hate
Carl's family?

11:10.497 --> 11:13.099
<i>Here's why.</i>

11:13.117 --> 11:15.368
This saga tells of how
Carl Carlson's family

11:15.402 --> 11:17.153
were the watchmen
of the coast,

11:17.204 --> 11:19.906
always keeping an eye out
for invading hordes.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.575
Iceland's safety depended
on their vigilance.

11:23.711 --> 11:25.928
But the Carlsons
failed in their duty.

11:25.963 --> 11:27.330
The enemy invaded,

11:27.364 --> 11:29.365
laying waste
to our lava fields,

11:29.400 --> 11:30.950
burning our sweaters

11:30.984 --> 11:33.786
and feasting upon
our tiny horses.

11:33.821 --> 11:35.955
Apparently, screwing
over your friends

11:35.989 --> 11:38.808
is in Carl's blood--
his adopted blood.

11:44.932 --> 11:47.734
All right, this is it,
Carl's family home.

11:47.768 --> 11:49.268
Twenty-two...

11:49.303 --> 11:52.371
Ooh, phew, oh,
that's a lot of letters.

11:52.406 --> 11:54.307
22 Hjorleifsstrati.

11:54.341 --> 11:57.443
So that's why 22 was
Carl's lottery number.

11:57.478 --> 12:00.646
Yeah, and that's why his
sweatpants say "Hjorleifsstrati"

12:00.681 --> 12:01.914
across the butt.

12:01.949 --> 12:04.283
The gates are locked.

12:04.318 --> 12:06.786
Well, then we'll just have
to wait for him to come out.

12:08.088 --> 12:10.323
Oh, man, stakeouts
are so boring.

12:10.357 --> 12:12.125
I wish I had something
to look at.

12:12.159 --> 12:16.329
Well, I guess I'll just read
the car rental contract again.

12:16.363 --> 12:18.097
Damage waiver, check.

12:18.115 --> 12:20.283
Return with full
tank of gas, check.

12:20.317 --> 12:23.453
All drivers must be
over the age of 25...

12:23.487 --> 12:25.104
and check.

12:26.457 --> 12:27.774
Love you, Mom.

12:27.808 --> 12:29.509
See you, Dad.

12:36.049 --> 12:37.483
It's Carl!

12:37.518 --> 12:38.551
Wake up, wake up!

12:38.585 --> 12:39.752
Huh?
Huh?

12:57.905 --> 12:59.638
Ah, damn it, we lost him!

13:00.841 --> 13:03.242
There he is.
And he's got our money!

13:19.993 --> 13:21.627
It's no use.

13:21.662 --> 13:23.662
We're perfectly matched.

13:27.651 --> 13:28.985
We did it!

13:31.855 --> 13:33.973
Give us some answers,
or you'll get a mouthful

13:34.007 --> 13:36.342
of rotten shark
fermented in its own urine.

13:36.376 --> 13:38.678
No, no, anything
but the inedible,

13:38.712 --> 13:40.746
repulsive food of
my native land.

13:40.781 --> 13:43.249
Yeah, Carl, tell them
the good reason you had

13:43.283 --> 13:44.517
for borrowing the money.

13:44.551 --> 13:45.751
Look, I admit it.

13:45.786 --> 13:47.687
I gave you the
ultimate screw-over.

13:47.721 --> 13:50.022
But I did it to clear
my family's name.

13:50.057 --> 13:52.291
Everyone blames the
barbarian invasion

13:52.326 --> 13:53.759
on my ancestors.

13:53.794 --> 13:56.996
But that saga had
a missing page.

13:57.030 --> 13:59.532
Oh, yeah...
a page was torn out.

13:59.566 --> 14:01.100
My family's always believed

14:01.134 --> 14:03.202
that we fought bravely
against the invaders,

14:03.237 --> 14:05.371
and the missing page
will prove it.

14:05.405 --> 14:07.840
I took the lottery money
to buy that page

14:07.875 --> 14:09.542
and restore my family's honor.

14:09.576 --> 14:10.776
Why didn't you just tell us?

14:10.811 --> 14:12.111
We're your friends.

14:12.145 --> 14:14.046
I didn't tell you because...

14:14.081 --> 14:15.281
we're not friends.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.200
Friends share their feelings,

14:18.235 --> 14:19.735
their hopes, their dreams.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.771
Friends know their friends
are from Iceland!

14:21.805 --> 14:24.574
We are just guys who sit
next to each other at a bar

14:24.608 --> 14:28.110
and talk about...
ugh... guy stuff.

14:28.145 --> 14:31.213
So all those years
of hanging out meant nothing?

14:31.248 --> 14:33.115
Not to me.
Sorry, Lenny.

14:33.150 --> 14:34.917
That's all right.
Now we know.

14:34.952 --> 14:36.519
It's all out in the open.

14:36.553 --> 14:39.755
I guess it kind of makes it
easier now for me to...

14:39.790 --> 14:41.123
to kill Carl!

14:43.560 --> 14:46.862
When the nice ones snap,

14:46.897 --> 14:49.031
it's always
a good show.

14:56.189 --> 14:57.489
Ow, my eye!
My eye!

14:57.523 --> 14:59.041
My eye!
My eye!

14:59.075 --> 15:01.043
Hey, hey, hey, Lenny,
forget him, forget him!

15:01.077 --> 15:02.778
Look, we still
got the money.

15:02.812 --> 15:04.780
- What the...?
- Wha...?

15:04.814 --> 15:06.148
What the hell is this?

15:06.182 --> 15:07.716
That's the missing page
from the saga.

15:07.751 --> 15:09.785
That's what I spent
our lottery money on.

15:09.819 --> 15:11.737
Then this belongs to us.

15:11.771 --> 15:13.005
Please, give it back! Please!

15:13.039 --> 15:14.773
It'll restore my family's honor!

15:14.808 --> 15:17.009
Maybe we'd give it back
to our friend,

15:17.043 --> 15:18.811
but we're not friends, remember?

15:18.845 --> 15:20.229
Sorry, Carl.

15:20.263 --> 15:21.997
It's World War II
all over again.

15:22.032 --> 15:24.433
America kicks Iceland's ass.

15:24.467 --> 15:25.768
No!

15:25.802 --> 15:28.904
Guys, do you think
Carl was right?

15:28.938 --> 15:31.240
What if we're not
real friends?

15:31.274 --> 15:33.692
Maybe we are just
lonely guys who do...

15:33.726 --> 15:35.461
guy stuff.

16:00.103 --> 16:01.370
Hi, Homie!

16:01.404 --> 16:02.838
Did you get the money?

16:02.872 --> 16:05.491
The kids have been stocking up
on pool noodles.

16:05.525 --> 16:07.426
Put the noodles in the shed.

16:07.460 --> 16:09.528
There isn't gonna be
a swimming pool.

16:09.562 --> 16:11.597
Hmm?
Carl spent all our money

16:11.631 --> 16:14.400
on this stupid page
from a stupid saga.

16:14.434 --> 16:16.735
I say we make it
into saga soup

16:16.770 --> 16:18.370
and have ourselves
a soup sip.

16:20.140 --> 16:23.208
That'll show Carl for
de-friending us in real life!

16:23.243 --> 16:25.077
I know Carl did you wrong,

16:25.111 --> 16:28.280
but is destroying something
he cares that much about

16:28.314 --> 16:30.582
really going to make you
feel good?

16:30.617 --> 16:32.785
Well, we won't
know that till after.

16:32.819 --> 16:36.121
Just read the saga
and see what it says.

16:36.156 --> 16:39.425
But how can we learn to read
ancient Icelandic?

16:39.459 --> 16:40.726
With these.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.194
Yeah, my doctor says

16:42.228 --> 16:44.379
it's better for me
not to sleep.

16:44.414 --> 16:45.747
Thorn?

16:45.782 --> 16:47.015
Yes!

16:47.050 --> 16:48.417
Forvitinn.

16:48.451 --> 16:50.752
I can't do this,
I can't do this!

16:50.787 --> 16:52.121
You can't not do it!

16:52.155 --> 16:55.457
Okay, let's see
what this thing says.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.376
"When the barbarian
invaders came,

16:57.410 --> 17:00.045
<i>the Carlsons met them</i>
<i>with their weapons ready..."</i>

17:00.079 --> 17:02.131
<i>Wow, Carl's family</i>
<i>really was brave.</i>

17:02.165 --> 17:03.532
<i>"...weapons</i>
<i>which they immediately</i>

17:03.566 --> 17:05.134
<i>"threw down in surrender.</i>

17:05.167 --> 17:08.103
<i>"The Carlsons then let</i>
<i>the barbarians in the back gate</i>

17:08.137 --> 17:10.589
<i>"and joined in the sacking,</i>
<i>the looting</i>

17:10.607 --> 17:13.308
<i>"and the volcano-ing</i>
<i>of the village elders.</i>

17:13.343 --> 17:15.877
<i>"The Carlsons</i>
<i>then wrote down this saga</i>

17:15.912 --> 17:19.781
<i>so no one would ever forget</i>
<i>their treachery and cowardice."</i>

17:19.816 --> 17:23.551
Carl's family was even worse
than people thought.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.654
They were the original
ultimate scumbags.

17:25.688 --> 17:28.490
Carl betrayed his friends,
blew the lottery money...

17:28.525 --> 17:30.559
all for nothing.
Hey, guys...

17:30.593 --> 17:32.628
I think I feel bad for Carl.

17:37.834 --> 17:39.935
Attention, everyone in Iceland.

17:39.969 --> 17:41.737
We have an important
announcement.

17:41.771 --> 17:44.173
Take a break from
your dreary lives

17:44.207 --> 17:45.741
to hear Americans
lecture you.

17:45.775 --> 17:47.276
Ah! Ah!
Eh!

17:47.310 --> 17:48.610
Is this everyone?

17:48.645 --> 17:49.845
No.

17:49.896 --> 17:51.530
Yes.

17:51.564 --> 17:53.999
I've learned something
about the people of Iceland.

17:54.033 --> 17:56.168
You have endured
barbarian invasions,

17:56.202 --> 17:57.703
total financial collapse

17:57.737 --> 17:59.771
and a lesbian prime minister.

17:59.806 --> 18:02.807
You've managed to survive
on a craphole island

18:02.825 --> 18:05.944
that looks like the moon
and smells like rotten eggs.

18:05.979 --> 18:09.214
And to do that,
you have to be stubborn.

18:09.249 --> 18:11.650
But I ask you to put aside
your stubbornness

18:11.684 --> 18:14.553
while I tell you
about Carl Carlson.

18:14.587 --> 18:16.338
Shame on Carl's family!

18:16.372 --> 18:20.209
The blood of 1,000 tiny horses
is on their hands.

18:20.243 --> 18:22.811
Doesn't matter what happened
1,000 years ago,

18:22.845 --> 18:25.547
for Carl Carlson's honor
has been redeemed

18:25.582 --> 18:27.783
by the deeds of Carl Carlson.

18:27.817 --> 18:30.168
Carl Carlson who helped me move,

18:30.186 --> 18:32.271
even though I moved
the week before.

18:33.289 --> 18:34.623
Yeah, and when we were

18:34.657 --> 18:36.391
painting my house,
Carl Carlson brought

18:36.426 --> 18:38.176
that blue tape, you know,

18:38.211 --> 18:40.012
that makes you really look
like you know what you're doing.

18:40.046 --> 18:41.313
You peel it off,

18:41.347 --> 18:42.781
and you got that
super straight line there.

18:43.917 --> 18:46.184
And when he brings
a six-pack to my house,

18:46.219 --> 18:48.186
he doesn't take the extras
home with him.

18:48.221 --> 18:50.672
Carl Carlson leaves them
in the fridge.

18:51.741 --> 18:53.141
Carl Carlson is our friend,

18:53.176 --> 18:54.793
even if he doesn't believe it.

18:56.629 --> 18:57.863
If we can forgive Carl

18:57.897 --> 18:59.598
for stealing our
lottery winnings,

18:59.632 --> 19:01.199
maybe youse can find it

19:01.234 --> 19:04.036
in youse's hearts
to forgive his ancestors.

19:04.070 --> 19:07.539
The many small kindnesses
of Carl Carlson

19:07.574 --> 19:10.375
have redeemed his
family forever.

19:12.211 --> 19:16.098
Mom, Dad, our family can
show our face in public

19:16.149 --> 19:18.367
for the first time
in 1,000 years.

19:21.754 --> 19:23.822
Ai.
Ai.

19:25.875 --> 19:30.045
How can you say these men
are not your true friends?

19:30.079 --> 19:32.364
I... I can't!

19:32.398 --> 19:36.218
I can't!

19:36.252 --> 19:38.453
Ai.

19:43.726 --> 19:46.295
Guys, thanks for teaching me

19:46.329 --> 19:48.463
the true meaning
of male friendship.

19:48.498 --> 19:49.965
The stuff that comes
from in here...

19:49.999 --> 19:51.933
that is guy stuff.

19:51.968 --> 19:54.236
We don't get together
to share our emotions.

19:54.270 --> 19:56.238
We get together to escape them.

19:56.272 --> 19:58.807
Yeah, I'd tell you guys
I love you, but, uh,

19:58.841 --> 20:00.075
I don't want to say it,

20:00.109 --> 20:01.610
and you don't
want to hear it.

20:01.644 --> 20:03.278
To nothing!

20:13.809 --> 20:16.811
Okay, everyone, get ready
to see your brand-new...

20:16.846 --> 20:18.830
Oh, oh!
What is it, what is it, what is it?

20:18.864 --> 20:19.931
...keg-pools!

20:19.965 --> 20:20.982
Yay!
Yay!

20:25.454 --> 20:27.188
Hey! Aah!

20:32.044 --> 20:33.294
Fine.

20:33.329 --> 20:35.096
I'm going home.
