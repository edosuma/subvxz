45:58.059 --> 46:01.280
The bookkeeper's 9 to 5 back
then was doing the books

46:01.454 --> 46:03.456
for one of Sullivan's
associates.

46:03.630 --> 46:05.675
But the associate gets
a little too fucking smart

46:05.850 --> 46:07.808
and starts skimming money
on the side.

46:07.982 --> 46:10.724
So when Jacob Sullivan
finds out,

46:10.898 --> 46:13.422
he tells the bookkeeper
to invite the associate over

46:13.596 --> 46:16.686
because two of them
were good friends.

46:16.861 --> 46:19.602
So the bookkeeper's wife
and daughter visit her mother

46:19.777 --> 46:21.256
and the associate comes over.

46:21.430 --> 46:23.737
They have some drinks,
have some cigars,

46:23.911 --> 46:25.260
and once he's good and sloshed,

46:25.434 --> 46:27.393
a few of Sullivan's guys
pay a little visit.

46:27.567 --> 46:29.699
One of them puts a .45
to the back of his skull,
