00:04.504 --> 00:06.756
{\an3}Man, this suitcase
is dang heavy.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.426
{\an1}"Dang"? Boy, it's a good
thing you left Texas.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.344
{\an3}It's good to see
you, Mariah.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.430
{\an3}I've missed you.
Oh, likewise.

00:13.513 --> 00:14.556
{\an1}I'm just glad you
remembered me.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.557
{\an3}Of course I
remembered you.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.684
{\an3}Meeting you was the
highlight of my summer.

00:19.602 --> 00:23.106
{\an5}MARIAH:
<i>Well, you made quite</i>
<i>an impression on me, too.</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:24.649
<i>And to think</i>
<i>if your car hadn't</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:26.609
<i>have broken down,</i>
<i>I never would've met you.</i>

00:26.693 --> 00:30.113
<i>We only must've spent,</i>
<i>what, 24 hours together, but...</i>

00:30.196 --> 00:32.782
<i>we sure shared a lot</i>
<i>in such a short time.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:36.619
<i>We talked a lot about,</i>
<i>uh, my family and your family.</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.206
<i>And you talked a lot about</i>
<i>a girl named Kelly.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:42.709
<i>It was quite a day</i>
<i>in Hadley City.</i>

00:42.792 --> 00:45.128
<i>I think they're still</i>
<i>talking about you.</i>

00:49.340 --> 00:51.509
{\an1}Well, honestly,
Brandon,

00:51.593 --> 00:53.303
{\an1}I can't say that I
would've been able to have

00:53.386 --> 00:55.638
gone to New York
and write my book

00:55.722 --> 00:57.182
{\an1}and bang down
my publisher's door

00:57.265 --> 00:58.892
{\an1}if it hadn't have been
for you crossing my path.

00:58.975 --> 01:00.643
{\an3}Oh, I don't know
about that.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.271
Wait a minute.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.522
You're a happy man.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.191
{\an1}You must've
found somebody.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.151
Yeah, yeah I did.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.652
You're back with Kelly?

01:09.736 --> 01:12.238
{\an3}No, no, I'm with
someone new,

01:12.322 --> 01:15.492
but, uh, I think you'll
like her just the same.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.037
Ah, here they are.
Hey, guys.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.455
You guys are late.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.290
Sorry, traffic was hell.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.334
{\an3}Uh, Mariah, this is everyone,
everyone this is Mariah.

01:24.417 --> 01:26.669
This is my better half, Tracy,

01:26.753 --> 01:29.464
the star anchorwoman of CUTV.
Hi, Tracy.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.549
Hi. I guess we'll be seeing
a lot of each other.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.842
I'll be covering
the New Age Festival.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.511
And she has
your seminar schedule.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.428
Oh, great.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.014
"Discovering
Your Guardian Angel," huh?

01:38.097 --> 01:39.933
Sounds interesting.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.393
Hi, I'm Steve Sanders.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.979
{\an6}I'm the guy who left
Brandon last year,
way out yonder.

01:45.063 --> 01:46.731
But I had just cause.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.941
Her name's Clare.

01:48.024 --> 01:49.192
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.528
{\an1}I swiped your manuscript
from Brandon,

01:51.611 --> 01:53.655
{\an1}so if he hasn't read
it yet, it's my fault.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.365
Oh. Well, have you?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.867
{\an1}I'm working on this
major term paper right now.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.035
But it's next on my list.

01:59.118 --> 02:00.703
{\an3}I read it.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.540
{\an3}You're Kelly.
Yes, hi.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.582
And by the way,
I loved the book.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.500
{\an1}Did you?
Mm-hmm.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.709
{\an3}KELLY:
You must be tired.

02:06.793 --> 02:07.877
Do you want some
tea or something?

02:07.961 --> 02:08.919
Yes, I'd love some tea.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.047
Great.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.427
{\an1}Well, either Mariah
met Kelly in a past life,

02:16.511 --> 02:17.762
{\an1}or you poured your
heart out to her

02:17.846 --> 02:19.681
in Lonesome City, Texas.

02:19.764 --> 02:22.600
{\an3}Just be an angel,
will you?

02:26.729 --> 02:29.149

{\an1}Well, it's a big
night tonight.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.333
I'll say.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.168
{\an1}I can't believe
how many calls I've had

04:12.251 --> 04:14.253
{\an1}from crew members
I got invited tonight.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.338
Well, what do you know?

04:15.421 --> 04:17.507
{\an3}Rob Andrews shows
a little excitement.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.343
Well, now I know
why everyone

04:20.426 --> 04:21.678
wants to come to Hollywood.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.513
Sure does feel
like the end of a rainbow.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.390
No, it's just the beginning.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.349
{\an1}Valerie.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.518
I appreciate you
stepping in as my manager.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.478
And I appreciate your patience.

04:30.561 --> 04:31.896
It's all new to me.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.982
{\an1}Well, you're doing great.
Thanks.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.234
So any reviews
in the papers yet?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.361
{\an3}No, not yet.
That'll be tomorrow.

04:38.444 --> 04:39.362
Stop worrying.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.364
The buzz on you is wonderful.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.533
And in a week,
it's going to open nationwide.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.368
Well, at least Mom and Pop
will make sure

04:45.451 --> 04:46.828
everyone in Indiana sees it.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.287
Only once?

05:01.968 --> 05:03.761
{\an3}Morning.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.514
Hi. I wanted
to surprise you guys,

05:06.597 --> 05:08.433
but, uh, I was too late.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.019
{\an3}Kelly already
lassoed Mariah.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.311
They went to the beach.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.604
Mm-hmm.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.732
Well, that means I get
you all to myself then.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.109
Mm. Breakfast included.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.737
{\an1}Why do I feel like I've
awakened at the Gaylian Ranch?

05:20.820 --> 05:24.407
{\an3}That's funny, I woke up
with Hong Kong on my mind.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.743
Really?

05:26.826 --> 05:28.369
Yeah, I just thought, you know,

05:28.453 --> 05:29.829
getting away like we did,

05:29.912 --> 05:31.539
{\an3}and getting to meet
your dad...

05:31.622 --> 05:34.417
{\an3}it brought us
to a whole new level.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.295
{\an1}Yeah. Yeah, it
was a good trip.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.298
Brandon?
Mm-hmm?

05:40.381 --> 05:42.717
I hope you know you can
always come talk to me.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.510
{\an3}You know, like you
did with Mariah.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.096
{\an1}It really bothers you,
doesn't it?

05:47.180 --> 05:50.224
{\an5}That I talked to...
Talked to a complete
stranger? Yeah.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.517
Well, Tracy, haven't
you ever had anyone

05:51.601 --> 05:53.603
{\an1}come out of nowhere
and just sort of help you

05:53.686 --> 05:55.438
put your life in order?

05:55.521 --> 05:56.731
That's what Mariah did.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.441
She helped me...

05:58.524 --> 06:01.444
put the past behind me.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.072
Good. I'm glad.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.326
What exactly did
you talk about?

06:08.409 --> 06:10.078
A little of everything.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.623
Kelly?
That, too.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.417
Well, what did you talk about?

06:16.501 --> 06:17.627
You know, Trace,

06:17.710 --> 06:19.420
this all happened
before I met you.

06:19.504 --> 06:20.797
Yeah, I know.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.427
{\an3}Look, Mariah and I
are just friends, okay?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.471
Okay.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.306
But you don't go
in for all this

06:30.389 --> 06:33.101
New Age stuff, do you?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.019
{\an3}I'm trying to keep
an open mind.

06:35.103 --> 06:36.813
A lot of people
find comfort in it,

06:36.896 --> 06:38.314
so who am I to judge?

06:39.899 --> 06:43.444
Yeah, well, I guess I'm just
a country girl, you know?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.321
I mean, I don't need
to jump on some

06:45.404 --> 06:48.449
pseudo-spiritual bandwagon
to know who I am.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.170
What?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.713
What?

07:02.797 --> 07:04.132
Why are you looking
at me like that?

07:04.215 --> 07:05.466
Like what?

07:05.550 --> 07:07.218
Like this.

07:07.301 --> 07:09.470
No, I'm not.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.055
Fine.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.306
Guess it was just an illusion.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.432
Silly me.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.019
Don, do you have
any blank discs?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.813
{\an3}I have to back
up my files.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.148
Um, yeah.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.191
Actually, I might have
some in my laptop bag.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.693
{\an3}Let me check, okay?
Thanks.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.403
Mm-hmm.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.157
If low values

07:29.240 --> 07:31.200
{\an3}of D-H imply higher
Baryon standards,

07:31.284 --> 07:32.994
{\an3}what's the amount of...
Clare.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.037
{\an1}I could really
use some advice.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.539
What?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.207
Donna and I
are going out tomorrow.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.668
Tomorrow night's kind
of a special evening,

07:40.751 --> 07:44.172
and I-I want to do
something nice for her.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.048
Something she wouldn't
expect from me.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.675
Take her to church.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.051
That will throw her.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.553
Ha. Ha-ha.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.014
Okay, maybe this
will help you, all right?

07:54.348 --> 07:56.058
{\an6}Donna, Kelly, and I
were making dinner
the other night

07:56.142 --> 07:57.894
and we were having this
conversation about

07:57.977 --> 08:01.439
men and their barbecues
and how the utensils

08:01.522 --> 08:05.234
from a Freudian standpoint,
could be construed as...

08:06.277 --> 08:08.070
{\an3}Never mind.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.865
Anyway, she said,
you don't cook.

08:13.951 --> 08:15.411
Yeah, she's right.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.747
I don't, I'm the king
of take out.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.045
That's it!

08:24.128 --> 08:26.380
I can cook for her.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.549
Dinner, dinner
in a lifeguard tower.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.759
{\an3}At night?

08:29.842 --> 08:31.594
You'll get arrested.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.054
She's coming.

08:33.136 --> 08:35.765
Clare, I don't
have any discs.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.433
Oh, it's okay.

08:37.515 --> 08:40.061
Sorry.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.778
What?!

08:49.820 --> 08:53.950
What?

08:54.033 --> 08:56.452
{\an1}Wow, what
an amazing coastline.

08:56.535 --> 08:58.538
{\an1}Y'all are so lucky
to live here all year round.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.747
{\an3}Well, I don't
know about you,

08:59.830 --> 09:00.998
but I miss New York.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.125
{\an3}That city just has
the most amazing energy.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.294
Oh, well, then you'll
have to come visit me.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.256
Well, you know I've secretly
been thinking

09:08.339 --> 09:09.090
of moving there
for graduate school.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.050
{\an3}You talk about
your town in Texas.

09:11.133 --> 09:15.137
Beverly Hills can be a very
small town, too.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.473
{\an3}How's that?
You know, same circle,

09:17.557 --> 09:20.101
same people,
same old regrets.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.103
By any chance does
this have anything to do

09:22.186 --> 09:23.813
with you and Brandon?

09:23.896 --> 09:26.482
Did he talk to you about me?

09:26.565 --> 09:29.568
Oh, girl, I spoke to him
about my ex-boyfriend, too.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.447
Well, I would be
lying if I said that

09:33.531 --> 09:35.324
Brandon wasn't one
of the reasons why

09:35.408 --> 09:37.326
I needed to make a change.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.954
Leave, you know?
Like you did.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.998
Yeah, it's important to know
that you're moving on.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.666
Not just running away.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.335
I think it's a little of both.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.754
So tell me how, did you get
involved with angels?

09:48.838 --> 09:51.215
My grandmother.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.718
Since I was about yea high,
she loved to tell me stories.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.344
{\an1}But that's
not how I got

09:55.428 --> 09:57.138
the idea about
writing a book on them.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.514
Oh, come on, do tell.

09:58.597 --> 10:01.267
I was at the library,
end of my shift,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.728
{\an4}pushing a cart
down the aisle,
when a big old book

10:03.811 --> 10:06.188
fell off the shelf and hit me
square on my crown chakra.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.482
{\an1}It was <i> The Lives</i>
<i>of the Saints,</i>

10:08.566 --> 10:10.693
and it was a thick book,
because Lord knows

10:10.776 --> 10:12.320
there's been enough martyrs
down through the ages.

10:12.403 --> 10:14.822
Anyway, the publisher was
out of New York.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.075
And it was the same house that
ended up buying my book.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.328
Wow, what a coincidence.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.912
Oh, there are no coincidences.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.373
Where are you from?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.459
Hadley City, Texas, ma'am.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.378
Where the steers and the beers
outnumber the tears and fears.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.099
Hey.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.226
Hey.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.770
What are you doing?

10:45.853 --> 10:48.105
I got to keep my hands busy
or I'm going to go crazy.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.359
Well you can use your hands
to try on this suit.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.904
{\an5}DISC JOCKEY (on radio):
Hey, Jeannie Fix coming
at you here with no mercy.

10:54.987 --> 10:56.113
Okay,<i> Adam's Children</i>

10:56.197 --> 10:57.239
opens tomorrow;
let's talk about it.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.202
It's got a hubba-hubba
new hunk in it, Rob Andrews.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.329
And let me tell you girls,
this guy is hot.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.289
Too bad he isn't
the entire movie,

11:05.373 --> 11:07.750
because the rest of it
you can flush.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.126
I mean, it sucks,

11:09.210 --> 11:10.503
people! Ugh!

11:12.171 --> 11:13.923
Did you hear that crap?

11:14.006 --> 11:16.592
Honey, relax, okay?

11:16.675 --> 11:17.760
She's a deejay.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.095
She's paid to run
off at the mouth.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.347
Yeah, but a lot of people
listen to her.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.182
She loved you.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.184
Valerie, there's more
to this movie than me.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.939
{\an3}Look, this week is going
to be really intense.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.273
You've got to be tough.

11:31.357 --> 11:34.276
Me? Come here.
Take a look at these hands.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.948
What do you see?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.784
Uh, a couple of scars,

11:41.867 --> 11:43.786
a lot of callouses. Why?

11:43.869 --> 11:46.455
I'm not as thin-skinned
as you think.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.124
{\an3}Well, good.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.292
Because there's going to be
a lot of people

11:50.376 --> 11:52.044
watching your every move
tonight.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.797
A lot of press and...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.757
even if they like the movie,
I mean, uh,

11:56.841 --> 11:58.467
they're gonna be still
taking their shots at you.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.386
{\an3}So you've got
be strong.

12:00.469 --> 12:02.138
You've got to be smart.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.013
Yeah, I know.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.015
But I still think
it's a good movie.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.060
Yeah. It is a good movie.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.314
Now, come here.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.442
Let's get these clothes
off of you.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.247
{\an5}MARIAH:
<i>Many people have their</i>
<i>most vivid angel experience</i>

12:28.330 --> 12:29.957
when their best laid plans
fall apart.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.377
For me, it was about five
minutes after I got off that bus

12:33.461 --> 12:35.171
at the Port Authority
in New York.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.131
I was mugged.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.300
There were three of them.

12:39.383 --> 12:42.178
They took everything,
including my manuscript.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.180
Then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

12:44.263 --> 12:47.224
this big huge man
come toward me.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.311
I mean, he looked like-like
a gargoyle or something,

12:50.394 --> 12:52.229
but he had all my things.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.023
I checked it out.

12:54.106 --> 12:55.441
He said, uh,

12:55.524 --> 12:57.109
"I believe this
belongs to you, miss."

12:57.193 --> 12:59.695
He had my purse, my luggage,

12:59.778 --> 13:01.405
my money, child, my work.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.408
And when I turned around
to thank him, he was gone.

13:04.492 --> 13:08.204
Now, later I realized
there <i> was</i> something missing.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.499
It was a little angel pin that
my grandmama had given to me.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.501
So I ran to the phone
to call her,

13:13.584 --> 13:16.086
and I said, "Grandmama,
I'm sorry, I-I lost your pin."

13:16.170 --> 13:17.880
And she said, "Child,

13:17.963 --> 13:21.050
"you didn't lose it,
you used it.

13:22.176 --> 13:25.179
That kind man
was your guardian angel."

13:29.308 --> 13:31.352
Thank you.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.937
Thank you.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.273
Well, I'm all aflutter.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.026
Pack it up, guys.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.611
{\an3}Hey, that was great!
Hey!

13:40.694 --> 13:41.862
Thank you.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.572
{\an1}Hey, I wanted
to hear some more.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.240
Oh, buy the book.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.408
Nice job, Mariah.
Thanks.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.577
If you guys like that.
I got a row of tickets

13:48.661 --> 13:49.370
to tomorrow night's
Lunar concert.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.247
You should come.
Uh, you know me--

13:51.330 --> 13:53.666
{\an3}a little of this stuff
goes a long way.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.708
Yeah, me, too.

13:54.792 --> 13:55.709
{\an1}KELLY:
Come on, you guys,

13:55.793 --> 13:57.253
check out this flyer.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.755
The C.U. Outdoor Theater,
Kim Robertson, harpist...

13:59.838 --> 14:00.923
What's not to love?

14:01.006 --> 14:02.716
{\an3}Okay, fine, you
talked us into it.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.969
Brandon, we have plans.

14:05.052 --> 14:05.886
Plans change.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.930
Besides, I wasn't
taking no for an answer.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.100
(laughs)

14:11.183 --> 14:13.269
Hey, Silver.
Hey.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.271
{\an3}Hey.
Say it isn't so.

14:15.354 --> 14:16.438
What?

14:16.522 --> 14:17.606
You is what.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.149
{\an3}You're playing chef
for Donna, right?

14:19.233 --> 14:21.694
{\an5}What's going on?
Wait a second,
did Clare tell you this?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.279
{\an1}I told her not
to tell anybody.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.155
{\an6}She didn't
tell anybody--
she told me.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.783
{\an3}Come on, fess up, what
are you gonna cook?

14:27.866 --> 14:29.868
{\an1}I'm just... I'm planning
something nice, okay?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.454
{\an3}Nice? Nice nice,
or nice-nice?

14:32.538 --> 14:35.291
{\an5}Nice, nice...
special nice.
Special nice.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.459
And very private, Steve.
Private, I love private.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.128
{\an1}Oh, great,
and there she is.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.630
{\an1}Look, could you just,
like, take off for a sec?

14:41.714 --> 14:42.715
Hello, boys.

14:42.798 --> 14:43.757
{\an1}Hey.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.925
Hi, Donna.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.093
Bye, Donna.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.970
{\an3}Steve, you don't
have to go.

14:48.053 --> 14:49.680
{\an1}Well, I...
Actually, he does.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.473
Thanks, Steve.
(giggles)

14:51.557 --> 14:54.476
{\an5}See you later, man.
You didn't have to
be so rude, you know?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.770
I didn't mean to be--
I just... I wanted...

14:56.854 --> 14:59.106
{\an1}I wanted to talk to you
alone for a second.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.316
{\an3}About what?

15:00.399 --> 15:01.775
{\an1}(sighs):
Tomorrow night.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.320
{\an1}I just, I want to make sure
that we're still on.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.156
You know what, now that you
mention it, I'm not so sure.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.324
{\an3}Why?
You know how I've

15:08.407 --> 15:10.659
{\an3}been having so much trouble
with this teacher lately,

15:10.743 --> 15:13.329
{\an5}Professor Langely?
Donna, Donna,
you'll be fine.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.165
{\an5}I don't know, I mean,
I've been so busy taking
care of my dad lately,

15:16.248 --> 15:18.000
{\an3}I have so much work
to catch up on.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.209
So do it tonight.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.294
Rob's premiere is tonight.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.170
So drop it.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.171
I don't want to drop it.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.840
I can't believe
you're getting so twisted up

15:24.923 --> 15:26.634
in this stupid
fashion course thing.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.511
Ah, see, stupid to you,
not stupid to me.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.805
Why are you being
so weird about this?

15:31.889 --> 15:33.641
What do you mean, weird?

15:33.724 --> 15:35.225
I don't know, I just don't get

15:35.309 --> 15:36.352
why tomorrow night's
so important.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.062
We go out almost
every night, anyway.

15:38.145 --> 15:41.315
You know, forget it,
forget it, never mind.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.108
No. David, wait.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.818
{\an3}Fine, okay, I will
study tonight.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.153
I won't go to
the premiere,

15:46.236 --> 15:48.364
{\an3}and you and I will
go out tomorrow night.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.157
Okay.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.700
{\an3}You happy now?
Mm-hmm.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.743
Good.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.539
(sighs)

16:04.296 --> 16:08.300
(lively dance music playing,
indistinct chatter, whooping)

16:26.485 --> 16:29.071
{\an3}So, what was it like working
with newcomer Rob Andrews?

16:29.154 --> 16:30.447
Oh, he was terrific!

16:30.531 --> 16:33.242
{\an1}He's a natural,
and a very good kisser.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.576
Oh.
Yeah.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.662
(laughs)
Thanks.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.205
Rob, everyone in this film

16:38.288 --> 16:40.582
talks about how great
you were to work with.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.459
Well, thanks man,
that's real nice to hear.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.378
Those are the opinions
I really care about.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.213
{\an6}All right. Thanks,
guys, for stopping.
Thanks.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.090
Any doubts?
About what?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.633
About your future.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.720
{\an4}Come on, I just want
to make it through the night.
Okay.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.099
Oh, Brandon, Tracy,
come here.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.726
VALERIE:
You-you haven't met Rob yet.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.769
{\an6}No, I haven't--
I was waiting for
the right time.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.771
Nice to meet you, man.
Nice to finally meet you.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.982
{\an5}I hope you like the film.
Thanks, I'm
sure we will.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.150
Tracy, you look great.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.026
Thanks. So do you.

17:08.109 --> 17:09.694
Excuse me.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.074
{\an1}Rob is so gorgeous.
Oh, I know.

17:14.157 --> 17:16.367
Well, your leading man
is no slouch, either.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.911
So, um, who else is coming?

17:17.994 --> 17:19.747
I mean, I know Donna
called and canceled.

17:19.829 --> 17:20.914
Um, Steve and Clare.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.624
{\an3}I wouldn't count
on Kelly, though--

17:22.708 --> 17:25.252
{\an6}Brandon said she's
over at C.U. getting
her aura read.

17:25.335 --> 17:28.172
{\an1}Really? Ah,
she gets her hooks into Mariah

17:28.255 --> 17:30.758
{\an6}and suddenly
is enlightened, huh?
Mm.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.595
Clare, where are you?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.097
Lost in the ozone.
Go away.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.640
I am not hanging up this phone

17:38.724 --> 17:40.809
until you agree
to come out and play with me.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.977
I can't.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.020
What do you mean, you can't?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.062
This premiere is awesome!

17:44.146 --> 17:45.981
You wouldn't believe
the people that are here.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.941
It's like...
it's like Planet Hollywood!

17:48.025 --> 17:49.485
Clint! I see Clint!

17:49.568 --> 17:52.029
Good, honey.
Go say hi, okay? Bye.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.906
D-Don't you hang up on me!

17:53.989 --> 17:56.325
Clare, you need to take a break.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.827
Under the laws of probability,
your paper will still be there

17:58.911 --> 17:59.995
when you get back, right, honey?

18:00.078 --> 18:01.371
Honey, you don't
understand, okay?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.664
I'm on a roll here.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.041
This term paper is due.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.001
You were on a roll
eight hours ago.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.377
Now you're on a death march.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.338
Look, Clare, what you need to do

18:09.421 --> 18:12.007
is take that number-two pencil
out of your hair,

18:12.090 --> 18:14.176
get rid of that leaky pen
behind your ear,

18:14.259 --> 18:18.347
get out of those
stinky, smelly sweats...

18:18.430 --> 18:21.058
Just... quit harassing me,
okay, Steve?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.352
I want you to walk over
to the bathroom,

18:23.435 --> 18:25.813
go into the shower,
take a warm, quick one,

18:25.896 --> 18:28.857
pin up your hair, put on
some of that sexy underwear

18:28.941 --> 18:31.068
and that long black dress--

18:31.151 --> 18:32.945
you know, the goddess gown?

18:33.028 --> 18:34.988
The one with the sparkles on it?

18:35.072 --> 18:36.782
You like that dress?

18:36.865 --> 18:38.325
Like it? That's
my favorite flavor, honey.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.202
Especially when you wear
those three-inch pumps.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.870
Yeah?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.956
Yeah.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.083
I can't.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.668
What do you mean, you can't?

18:47.751 --> 18:49.086
You have to--
somebody's got to show

18:49.169 --> 18:50.546
all these Hollywood wannabees

18:50.629 --> 18:52.881
what true glamour's all about,
and that's you.

18:52.965 --> 18:56.844
You think so, huh?

18:56.927 --> 18:57.886
Oh, I don't know... (gasps)

18:57.970 --> 19:00.389
(electronic buzzing)

19:00.472 --> 19:01.390
Damn it!

19:01.473 --> 19:03.725
Oh, my God!

19:03.809 --> 19:05.060
Oh, my God,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.019
my paper!

19:06.103 --> 19:07.271
It's gone!

19:07.354 --> 19:08.230
Well, reboot it.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.857
I tried that, you idiot!

19:09.940 --> 19:12.234
Thanks a lot--
look what you've done.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.069
What did I do?

19:14.153 --> 19:16.697
(taps keyboard, whimpers)

19:40.846 --> 19:41.930
Honey...

19:42.014 --> 19:44.975
{\an6}you've been out here
for half the movie--
what's wrong?

19:45.058 --> 19:46.852
Did you hear them in there?

19:46.935 --> 19:48.812
{\an1}Those people snickering
in front of us?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.732
{\an3}Sweetie, don't let those jerks
spoil your evening, okay?

19:51.815 --> 19:53.609
{\an3}Come on.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.110
Come back inside with me.

19:55.193 --> 19:56.820
(people applauding)

19:56.904 --> 19:59.072
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

19:59.156 --> 20:01.325
(sighs)

20:11.335 --> 20:12.961
That Rob guy is great.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.254
{\an3}Yeah.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.797
{\an4}BRANDON:
Hey, let's just
keep moving, huh?

20:15.881 --> 20:16.798
It's pretty crowded.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.593
{\an1}We'll pay our respects
to Rob at the After Dark.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.470
{\an3}You like the movie
that much, huh?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.055
Rob was fine, it's
just the rest of it

20:23.138 --> 20:25.015
kind of dragged, you know?

20:25.098 --> 20:27.309
{\an3}Kind of like you
and me lately?

20:27.392 --> 20:28.810
What are you talking about?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.313
Just... your head's
been in the clouds.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.981
Since Mariah arrived.

20:33.065 --> 20:33.982
I didn't say that.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.984
You didn't have to.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.486
Hey, Rob, great job!

20:37.569 --> 20:38.779
You're going to be a big star.

20:38.862 --> 20:39.863
{\an3}Thanks, man.
So you liked the movie?

20:39.947 --> 20:41.949
Honestly?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.325
You've got a lot better
movies in your future.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.660
What's wrong with this one?

20:44.743 --> 20:45.994
It's too soft.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.621
We're going to
have to rethink

20:47.704 --> 20:48.830
the nationwide release.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.165
But it'll do well on video.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.167
We'll be talking.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.129
Don't worry, honey, okay?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.839
I mean, to hell with the movie.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.007
I mean, they loved you.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.051
That's what matters.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.054
{\an1}Okay?

21:05.722 --> 21:07.391
Come on.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.358
I would have to drink my coffee

21:16.441 --> 21:17.526
with cream and sugar.

21:17.609 --> 21:20.862
{\an1}Okay, maybe this is
a little extreme.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.698
{\an1}You sure you know
what you're doing, Clare?

21:22.781 --> 21:23.865
No.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.326
Can't you just call the C.U.
computer science department?

21:26.410 --> 21:27.577
I mean, they must
have people there

21:27.661 --> 21:28.996
who can retrieve lost files.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.038
I did.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.331
They didn't spring anyone.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.541
They have some crisis.

21:32.624 --> 21:33.542
Some mainframe went down.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.419
Can you make
more coffee?

21:35.502 --> 21:36.253
Yeah, good idea.

21:36.336 --> 21:38.088
I have some studying
to do myself.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.175
(phone ringing)

21:42.259 --> 21:43.468
(grunting)

21:45.470 --> 21:46.596
Yeah, what?

21:46.680 --> 21:47.889
Hey, sexy, how you doing?

21:47.973 --> 21:48.932
You almost finished?

21:49.016 --> 21:50.517
I'm at the Peach Pit After Dark.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.060
The party is awesome.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.061
Oh, yeah, I'm finished.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.229
No thanks to you.

21:54.312 --> 21:55.731
Well, I would've
loved to have helped,

21:55.814 --> 21:57.274
but what do I know
about applied physics

21:57.357 --> 21:58.900
other than the
principle of friction?

21:58.984 --> 21:59.860
(laughs)

21:59.943 --> 22:01.028
You know,

22:01.111 --> 22:02.571
I loathe you right now.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.948
I love you, too.
Listen, put that dress on.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.324
You've gotta get down here!

22:06.408 --> 22:08.035
The premier party
is about to begin

22:08.118 --> 22:10.078
and Valerie's got us
a power table.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.040
Are you completely clueless?

22:13.123 --> 22:13.915
Do you have any idea
what you've done to me here?

22:13.999 --> 22:16.418
I've spent the last two hours

22:16.501 --> 22:19.713
in computer hell thanks to you
and your stupid interruptions.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.881
Hey, calm down.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.424
You backed it up
all on disc, right?

22:22.507 --> 22:23.925
No, I did not.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.927
Because I didn't
have any discs, okay?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.055
So, now 75 pages of data,

22:28.138 --> 22:32.934
referential equations,
and summaries are gone!

22:33.018 --> 22:34.269
Gee, I'm sorry, Clare.

22:34.352 --> 22:36.104
(mimicking):
Gee, I'm sorry, Clare.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.439
What is that, your mantra now?

22:37.522 --> 22:39.733
Hey, you don't have to
get hostile with me.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.694
Yeah, and you don't have
to call anymore, do you?

22:42.778 --> 22:43.779
(grunts)

22:50.994 --> 22:52.454
{\an1}ROB:
I had a great time.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.289
{\an1}I don't care what anyone
says about the film,

22:54.372 --> 22:55.665
you guys did a great job.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.708
We appreciate that, Rob.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.126
See you on the next one, man.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.795
Hey guys, will you excuse us?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.797
Can't keep the press waiting.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.007
Ah, forget it.
I'm not facing the firing squad.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.426
Rob, listen to me
carefully, okay?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.762
You don't have
to defend this movie.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.972
You didn't have any control
over the outcome, okay?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.849
{\an3}Just tell everybody
how exciting

23:12.933 --> 23:14.434
the experience was for you

23:14.518 --> 23:16.186
{\an3}and you can't wait
to do another movie.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.771
Just move on, huh?

23:17.854 --> 23:19.231
Absolutely. Come on.

23:21.149 --> 23:22.609
{\an1}REPORTER:
Rob, Rob!

23:22.692 --> 23:25.153
Despite rave reviews
for your performance,

23:25.237 --> 23:26.655
several critics have seriously

23:26.738 --> 23:28.323
knocked <i> Adam's Children.</i>
You got a comment?

23:28.406 --> 23:29.324
Yeah, they're wrong.

23:29.407 --> 23:30.325
It's a great movie.

23:30.408 --> 23:33.328
{\an1}Come on, the film's a dud
and everyone knows it.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.163
{\an1}Do you think this will
hurt your career?

23:35.247 --> 23:37.541
{\an3}You know, I can probably
answer that for him.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.459
I was addressing
the question to Rob.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.836
Let me handle this.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.379
You know what, lady,
the only thing

23:42.462 --> 23:44.005
your bad mouthing is gonna do is

23:44.089 --> 23:45.507
hurt a lot of good
and talented people

23:45.590 --> 23:46.508
who spent months
putting their blood,

23:46.591 --> 23:48.009
sweat, and tears into making it.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.511
{\an3}Well, blood, sweat and tears
doesn't really cut it.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.512
I mean, the movie stinks.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.513
Have you ever made a movie?

23:51.596 --> 23:53.682
Have any of you?

23:53.765 --> 23:54.641
I didn't think so.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.059
You people are too busy
tearing things down

23:56.143 --> 23:57.102
to make anything.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.562
{\an1}Can we quote you
on that, Rob?

23:58.645 --> 24:00.814
{\an1}You can blow it...
Rob...

24:03.066 --> 24:04.151
Guys, I'm really sorry,

24:04.234 --> 24:05.402
he's just really
not used to this.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.195
I hope you can give him a break.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.488
Didn't he already get one?

24:26.756 --> 24:27.966
{\an1}David, turn
the flame down for me...

24:28.049 --> 24:29.050
Nat, please!
Don't help me, okay?

24:29.134 --> 24:31.553
I want to be able to tell
Donna I did this myself.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.597
I know, but, you know,
you've got so much...

24:33.680 --> 24:36.099
{\an3}The directions say if I use
a quarter cup of olive...

24:36.183 --> 24:37.100
No!

24:37.184 --> 24:39.060
No!

24:39.144 --> 24:40.061
No!

24:40.145 --> 24:42.355
What are you doing?!

24:44.149 --> 24:45.734
Great, now you
ruined my eggplant!

24:45.817 --> 24:47.736
Your eggplant? What do you want
to do-- burn down my kitchen?

24:47.819 --> 24:48.737
Turn the burner off.

24:48.820 --> 24:51.907
Okay. Great.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.700
(coughing)
David,

24:53.783 --> 24:55.785
you're on your own.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.078
(phone ringing)

24:57.162 --> 25:00.040
(panting)

25:00.123 --> 25:01.082
Hello.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.918
David, hey, it's me.

25:03.001 --> 25:03.919
Hey, hi.

25:04.002 --> 25:04.961
Hi, where are you?

25:05.045 --> 25:08.089
(coughing):
At the, uh, the Pit.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.382
Oh, are you all right?

25:09.466 --> 25:10.383
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

25:10.467 --> 25:11.968
just, uh, somebody smoking.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.262
You know, they should
have a law against that.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.931
There is a law.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.599
Anyway, David, I'm really sorry,

25:17.682 --> 25:19.601
but I'm gonna have to
cancel out on you tonight.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.812
What? No, you can't.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.231
I have to, you don't understand.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.274
Clare's computer
blew up last night.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.610
I spent half the night trying to
help her put it back together.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.986
I got, like, no studying done,

25:30.070 --> 25:31.947
and now I'm totally exhausted.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.615
Yeah, yeah.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.242
I'm kind of tired of this, too.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.494
David, please
understand this, okay?

25:37.577 --> 25:39.162
We'll just do it another night.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.997
Yeah, all right.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.960
David, I'm sorry.

25:45.043 --> 25:46.628
Yeah, I heard you
the first time.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.296
Bye.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.757
Bye.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.683
So, how do you like
the City of Angels so far?

25:59.766 --> 26:01.059
Oh, it suits me.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.686
{\an1}And your friends
are very nice.

26:02.769 --> 26:03.687
How would you know?

26:03.770 --> 26:05.438
You've been held hostage
by Kelly the whole time.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.274
{\an1}(chuckles)

26:07.357 --> 26:09.192
{\an1}Well, maybe it's
the other way around.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.819
{\an1}You know, you two
are very much alike.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.320
Really?

26:12.404 --> 26:13.947
How so?

26:14.030 --> 26:15.282
I just think that you both

26:15.365 --> 26:16.324
try to be very noble

26:16.408 --> 26:19.661
and do the right thing,
very grounded in reality

26:19.744 --> 26:23.290
but deep down inside
you're being pulled elsewhere.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.499
Elsewhere.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.834
Like where?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.210
I don't know.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.838
Maybe towards each other?

26:29.921 --> 26:33.300
Is this your intuition talking?

26:33.383 --> 26:34.551
Loud and clear.

26:36.261 --> 26:40.724
Look, Mariah, Kelly and I
had our chance.

26:40.807 --> 26:44.311
It didn't work out,
so now we're just friends.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.562
End of story.

26:45.645 --> 26:47.397
And you accept that?

26:47.480 --> 26:50.233
Yeah, and so does Kelly.

26:52.444 --> 26:53.862
Doesn't she?

26:53.945 --> 26:55.071
If you have to ask,

26:55.155 --> 26:57.157
maybe it's not
the end of the story.

26:57.240 --> 26:59.492
What is going on in that
little Texan head of yours?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.494
What, I just...

27:01.578 --> 27:05.498
Oh, I just had a feeling about
you, tonight.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.876
Well, I hope Tracy
is included in that,

27:07.959 --> 27:09.794
because she is who
I'm taking tonight, you know.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.046
Oh, I know.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.256
And I'm trying to make it work.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.132
I know.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.925
And Kelly and I
never made much sense

27:16.009 --> 27:17.510
when you really
think about it anyway.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.347
{\an3}So, why don't you
do me a favor

27:20.430 --> 27:22.265
and get to know Tracy?
She's a good kid.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.975
And stop trying
to stir things up.

27:24.059 --> 27:25.352
What? Me?

27:34.361 --> 27:35.904
Hey.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.280
Hi.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.115
What are you doing?

27:39.199 --> 27:41.368
{\an1}Trying to find somebody
who said the movie was good.

27:41.451 --> 27:42.786
Honey, every review said

27:42.869 --> 27:44.621
you're the one good thing
it had to offer.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.623
There'll be other roles,
better ones, you'll see.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.208
Even after my performance
last night?

27:48.291 --> 27:49.959
{\an3}Well, from what
I know of this town,

27:50.043 --> 27:52.253
a bad boy image
is not gonna hurt you.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.714
Yeah, well, I don't think I like
what this town is doing to me.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.758
Well, you sitting here
obsessing about it

27:56.841 --> 27:58.259
is not gonna do you any good.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.552
You're right.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.554
That's why I'm packing it in.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.265
{\an1}What?!

28:04.349 --> 28:07.268
I'm just not cut out
for this business.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.771
Oh, please.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.107
Are you crazy?

28:12.190 --> 28:13.274
No, just the opposite.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.902
This is no time
for self pity here.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.821
You've been given
a million-to-one shot.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.115
Don't get me wrong,
I know how lucky I've been.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.075
But I'm going back to Indiana.

28:22.158 --> 28:24.285
Don't do this.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.954
I'm sorry.

28:26.037 --> 28:26.996
Rob, you can't do this.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.415
You have a future here.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.833
{\an1}Forget it.
Forget it?

28:29.916 --> 28:30.542
Forget me?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.001
Look, I'm just not happy here.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.128
Can't you understand that?

28:33.211 --> 28:34.379
Do you understand
how much work

28:34.462 --> 28:36.965
{\an6}I've put into you for the
last couple of weeks?
Right.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.967
So you're just like
everyone else in this town.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.260
Worried about your piece of me.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.137
Wait a minute.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.472
You asked me to be your manager.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.306
I didn't volunteer.

28:45.390 --> 28:48.268
{\an1}I was completely fine
the way we were.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.019
But I am telling you,
right here, right now,

28:50.103 --> 28:50.979
we have a contract.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.481
And I am holding you
to it for your own good.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.233
You're not going anywhere.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.821
I'm gonna make this
easy on both of us.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.948
I'm leaving.

29:02.031 --> 29:03.575
You're fired.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.662
You know what?

29:07.745 --> 29:09.998
Go to hell.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.385
Hey, what's going on?

29:22.469 --> 29:24.179
It's a total disaster.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.097
I've started over,

29:26.181 --> 29:27.515
{\an3}with only a third
of my notes.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.558
I'm sorry.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.643
What's wrong with you?

29:30.727 --> 29:32.896
I'm just kind of worried
about David.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.023
{\an1}He's getting...
What?

29:35.106 --> 29:36.274
I don't know.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.568
I hate to say it,
I hate to even think it,

29:38.651 --> 29:41.863
but he's starting
to behave weird again.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.406
Like plans change

29:43.490 --> 29:45.033
or things get rearranged,
he just flips out.

29:45.116 --> 29:48.161
David would do anything for you.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.038
{\an3}I wouldn't call
that weird.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.040
I'd love a little
of that right now.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.709
You don't see Steve here
in my hour of need, do you?

29:54.792 --> 29:57.003
{\an1}You rang?

29:57.086 --> 29:58.880
What are you doing here?

29:58.963 --> 30:02.550
Uh, I'll just leave
you two to... whatever.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.762
Relax, Arnold.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.347
I come bearing gifts.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.765
What? What is that?

30:10.183 --> 30:12.227
This is a removable hard drive

30:12.310 --> 30:13.895
and that is a disc
utilities program.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.063
I spent the entire morning

30:15.146 --> 30:18.233
with two geeks from the
intrafraternity computer club

30:18.316 --> 30:19.609
learning how to
use this software

30:19.692 --> 30:21.069
just so I can recover your file.

30:21.152 --> 30:24.072
Now, what'd you name it?

30:24.155 --> 30:26.074
Uh... "AP

30:26.157 --> 30:28.243
"dash-Physics

30:28.326 --> 30:31.079
"dot-Arnold."

30:31.162 --> 30:33.039
Come to papa.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.710
That's my term paper?

30:37.794 --> 30:39.087
That's it.

30:39.170 --> 30:40.588
Great.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.758
10 weeks of slaving over
quantitative equations,

30:43.841 --> 30:45.093
theoretical juxtapositions...

30:45.176 --> 30:48.054
Just relax, okay
it's transcribing.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.933
{\an3}There, is that more
what you had in mind?

30:52.016 --> 30:54.102
Oh, my God.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.980
{\an1}You did it.
Yeah.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.231
(shrieking)

30:58.314 --> 30:59.023
There'll be some
holes to fill in

30:59.107 --> 31:00.024
but I'm sure
you can handle that.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.485
Where are you going?

31:02.569 --> 31:04.320
My work here is done.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.738
You're leaving?

31:05.822 --> 31:07.156
Yeah, that's right, Clare.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.616
You know, I don't know much
about applied physics,

31:08.700 --> 31:10.118
but I do know one thing,

31:10.201 --> 31:12.161
you can find yourself
a new punching bag.

31:23.006 --> 31:23.965
Hey, Chip, is Tracy around?

31:24.048 --> 31:25.133
She went to get coffee.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.426
{\an1}Is that
her editorial wrap-up?

31:26.509 --> 31:28.177
{\an3}Yep, cued up and
ready to roll.

31:28.261 --> 31:30.221
Thanks, bro.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.561
What is our
administration thinking?

31:36.644 --> 31:37.812
A New Age Festival?

31:37.895 --> 31:40.189
Although I did enjoy hearing

31:40.273 --> 31:42.317
the stories of angel expert,
Mariah Murphy,

31:42.400 --> 31:44.485
I've still got to wonder
why anyone would buy into this.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.529
What's next?

31:46.613 --> 31:48.072
A new age studies program?

31:48.156 --> 31:50.199
A Ph.D in psychic channeling?

31:50.283 --> 31:51.075
Checking up on me?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.328
I'm the news director.
That's my job.

31:53.411 --> 31:56.122
You don't like it.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.165
No, I don't.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.125
I think you've gone
out of your way

31:59.208 --> 32:00.960
to slam the festival and Mariah.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.420
Brandon, I'm not
slamming Mariah.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.005
What do you want me to do?

32:04.088 --> 32:05.298
Slant it to bolster
her book sales

32:05.381 --> 32:06.174
because she's your friend?

32:06.257 --> 32:08.176
{\an3}What kind of journalism
would that be?

32:08.259 --> 32:10.470
I just think you've inserted a
little envy into it, that's all.

32:10.553 --> 32:12.055
Envy? Over what?

32:12.138 --> 32:13.514
I don't know.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.183
Maybe all the time she's
been spending with Kelly.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.644
Yeah, well, I don't trust
the two of them together.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.895
Why not?

32:18.978 --> 32:22.065
I think they're ganging up
against me.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.941
Trace, aren't you being
just a little bit paranoid?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.193
Oh, yeah?

32:25.276 --> 32:27.570
Well, it wasn't so long ago that
Kelly told me right to my face

32:27.654 --> 32:28.863
that she was still
in love with you.

32:28.946 --> 32:29.864
Does that sound

32:29.947 --> 32:31.324
paranoid to you?

32:32.784 --> 32:33.576
Does, uh,

32:33.660 --> 32:36.204
this mean you're
not coming tonight?

32:38.164 --> 32:40.208
Right.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.850
How's it going?

32:57.934 --> 33:00.269
Good.
I finished my paper.

33:00.353 --> 33:03.272
I think it's actually
better than it was before.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.273
See.

33:04.357 --> 33:06.609
I think you owe Steve
a little apology now.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.736
Why? He's just gonna
rub it in my face.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.946
Clare, just apologize.

33:10.029 --> 33:11.030
It's the right thing to do.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.365
What, are you my conscience now?

33:12.448 --> 33:13.366
Do I need to be?

33:13.449 --> 33:16.577
(phone ringing)

33:16.661 --> 33:18.037
Hello?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.914
Donna, Donna, hey, it's me.

33:19.997 --> 33:22.542
I'm at the club, I need you
to get over here right away.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.419
David, the club?
It's closed tonight.

33:24.502 --> 33:25.753
Yeah, I know, I know.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.463
Look, I can't talk
about it, all right?

33:27.547 --> 33:28.589
Just get over here.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.590
And come by yourself.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.425
David, are you okay?

33:30.508 --> 33:31.634
Are you coming or not?

33:31.718 --> 33:33.344
Yeah, okay, fine, I'm on my way.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.429
Uh, Donna?
What?

33:34.512 --> 33:35.555
Drive careful, okay?

33:35.638 --> 33:37.598
Okay.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.100
What?

33:39.183 --> 33:41.102
I don't know, it's David.

33:41.185 --> 33:42.103
Clare, he's really scaring me.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.312
I think he's...

33:43.396 --> 33:46.023
Crazy?
Yeah.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.276
He's not.

33:48.359 --> 33:49.819
Trust me.

33:49.902 --> 33:51.487
Okay.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.123
Hey, I thought you were
coming to the concert.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.917
I was. Now I'm not.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.003
Rob trouble?

34:07.086 --> 34:09.505
{\an1}You know, I guess it's
just not in my cards

34:09.589 --> 34:11.466
to hold onto anything good.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.178
I wouldn't buy into
that if I were you.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.638
{\an1}Well, it's really
hard not to, Brandon.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.139
I mean, I really wanted things

34:19.223 --> 34:20.433
to work out with me and Rob.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.684
So what's the problem?

34:21.768 --> 34:24.687
He's too nice.
He's too nice?

34:24.771 --> 34:26.022
{\an3}Hmm.

34:26.105 --> 34:27.315
All right, well,

34:27.398 --> 34:28.815
why don't you
come with me anyway

34:28.900 --> 34:30.067
because misery
does love company.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.985
Really, what happened?

34:32.069 --> 34:33.737
Tracy and I are having

34:33.821 --> 34:36.407
a philosophical
difference of opinion.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.826
Which means you had a fight?

34:38.909 --> 34:40.453
{\an3}Copy.

34:40.536 --> 34:42.079
So, come on, get up.
Get dressed, let's go.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.873
Maybe a little harp
and Tibetan bell music

34:43.956 --> 34:46.208
{\an3}will be just what
the doctor ordered.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.210
No, I think I'm just gonna

34:48.293 --> 34:51.047
wallow in my misery
for a little longer.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.172
You go on without me.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.174
Have fun.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.510
Okay.

34:55.592 --> 34:56.677
See ya.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.472
Bye.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.191
David?
David, where are you?

35:11.234 --> 35:12.193
{\an1}Over here.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.571
(romantic music plays)

35:20.576 --> 35:22.537
What is this?

35:22.620 --> 35:27.083
Well, this is our beach.

35:27.166 --> 35:30.044
And this is our dinner.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.380
I cooked.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.301
{\an1}Come on, relax,
take your shoes off.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.890
You did cook.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.059
Oh, this is incredible.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.520
Yeah, well, I hope you feel
the same way after you taste it.

35:47.603 --> 35:50.439
We have Cornish game hen

35:50.523 --> 35:53.025
stuffed with
wild rice and mushrooms

35:53.109 --> 35:56.362
and a vegetable julienne.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.077
{\an3}David, I...

36:03.161 --> 36:04.871
I have to admit,

36:04.954 --> 36:06.622
{\an3}I was kind of worried
that you were...

36:06.706 --> 36:08.207
Yeah, I know, I know,
going a little crazy.

36:08.291 --> 36:10.710
Well, I have to
admit that, uh,

36:10.793 --> 36:12.420
my nerves are shot.

36:12.503 --> 36:13.546
I oversteamed the vegetables

36:13.629 --> 36:15.089
{\an1}and I put a little
too much salt

36:15.172 --> 36:16.424
in the scallop potatoes.

36:20.303 --> 36:23.139
So, uh, what is this all about?

36:23.222 --> 36:24.432
What, you don't remember?

36:25.516 --> 36:27.059
{\an1}April 9th.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.561
Think about it.

36:28.644 --> 36:30.271
Five years ago.

36:30.354 --> 36:31.939
Where were we?

36:32.815 --> 36:35.401
Okay, I'm thinking.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.945
I'm thinking real hard.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.572
{\an4}Okay, then I'll
give you a hint.
Okay.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.657
It was spring.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.576
Love was in the air
and my father was

36:43.659 --> 36:45.119
about to marry Jackie Taylor.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.292
And we took a walk on the beach.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.669
That we did.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.880
That's when you
told me you loved me.

36:55.963 --> 36:59.258
The first time I ever said it.

36:59.342 --> 37:01.594
Yeah, me too.

37:01.677 --> 37:04.931
And I never stopped.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.268
I think it's real important

37:09.352 --> 37:14.649
to remember where we started,
where we are,

37:14.732 --> 37:16.317
and where we're going.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.779
I love you.

37:19.862 --> 37:23.240
I love you, too.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.173
(harp plays)

37:48.683 --> 37:51.644
♪ ♪

38:11.455 --> 38:13.207
Hey, you made it.

38:13.290 --> 38:14.583
Where's Tracy?

38:14.667 --> 38:16.377
{\an1}She's uh, she's
not feeling well.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.045
Oh.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.046
Where's Clare?

38:19.130 --> 38:21.215
Who cares?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.719
{\an3}I hear she's been a
little ornery lately.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.679
I have had it.

38:26.762 --> 38:28.055
I've had it.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.890
I think it's time
for a change of scenery.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.225
Maybe the monkhood.

38:31.308 --> 38:34.145
Everything's been
out of whack this weekend.

38:40.109 --> 38:43.237
♪ ♪

38:45.156 --> 38:46.032
Are you Mr. Sanders?

38:46.115 --> 38:47.074
Yes.

38:47.158 --> 38:48.743
These are for you.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.703
Thank you.

39:22.234 --> 39:24.445
I guess there can be

39:24.528 --> 39:26.280
more than one jerk in
our relationship, huh?

39:26.364 --> 39:30.326
Absolutely.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.505
{\an3}Now, that's what
I call an apology.

39:49.845 --> 39:52.139
(doorbell rings)

39:59.230 --> 40:00.439
Can I come in?

40:08.781 --> 40:09.865
{\an1}So...

40:09.949 --> 40:13.119
So, I'm sorry things
turned ugly.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.622
Me, too, uh...

40:16.705 --> 40:20.626
Look, Rob, I'm really
glad you fired me.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.295
I don't want to be your manager.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.297
I just want you to stay.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.633
{\an1}I hope you
changed your mind.

40:27.716 --> 40:28.843
About leaving?

40:28.926 --> 40:31.178
No, I'm sorry, Val.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.139
I'm packed and ready to roll.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.891
Back to Indiana, huh?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.601
It's where I belong.

40:37.685 --> 40:38.853
It's home.

40:38.936 --> 40:42.148
So, um,

40:42.231 --> 40:43.941
when are you coming back?

40:44.024 --> 40:46.777
I'm not.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.655
What about us?

40:54.076 --> 40:58.330
If I were just a carpenter,
would you be with me?

41:04.336 --> 41:07.089
I don't know.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.219
I'm really gonna
miss you, though.

41:14.680 --> 41:15.806
Come here.

41:33.782 --> 41:36.035
Just like in the movies, huh?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.056
{\an6}BRANDON:
I can't believe
Mariah never showed up.

41:57.139 --> 41:58.015
{\an1}KELLY:
She said she was sorry.

41:58.098 --> 42:00.226
{\an1}She had an emergency
meeting back in New York.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.937
Come on, I want you to
read my physics paper.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.813
There's this gap in it

42:04.897 --> 42:07.441
{\an3}on the principle
of friction.

42:07.524 --> 42:09.944
Friction? Nice night, eh?

42:11.487 --> 42:13.113
You cold?

42:13.197 --> 42:14.990
Yeah, I wasn't thinking.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.076
That's all right.

42:17.159 --> 42:19.787
Here, take my jacket.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.165
Thanks.

42:42.309 --> 42:45.104
{\an3}I'm sorry,

42:45.187 --> 42:48.107
I shouldn't have done that.

42:48.190 --> 42:50.484
No, um...

42:50.567 --> 42:51.860
Um...
