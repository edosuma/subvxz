THESE WERE THE INGREDIENTS
CHOSEN TO CREATE THE
PERFECT LITTLE GIRL.

00:10.016 --> 00:15.004
BUT PROFESSOR UTONIUM
ACCIDENTALLY ADDED AN EXTRA

CHEMICAL X.

00:16.018 --> 00:18.001

01:34.008 --> 01:35.028
AH...I WAS 12.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.018

HAVE A NEW FATHER NOW.

02:53.027 --> 02:54.026
- WHAT?

02:54.028 --> 02:57.008
- I BROUGHT THE BOYS BACK,

02:57.010 --> 03:00.020
SO I AM THEIR FATHER NOW.

03:00.022 --> 03:02.004
- INCORRECT!

03:02.006 --> 03:04.029
THE ROWDY ROUGH BOYS
WERE MY IDEA,

03:05.001 --> 03:07.009
WHICH MEANS
I WAS THE ORIGINAL CREATOR.

03:07.011 --> 03:09.028
YES, IT WAS I WHO ORIGINALLY
CREATED THEM,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.004
WHICH MEANS IT WAS I
WHOSE CREATIVITY LED TO
THE ORIGIN OF THE IDEA

03:13.006 --> 03:14.023
WHICH RESULTED IN THE CREATION
OF THEM.

03:14.025 --> 03:18.005
THEREFORE,
THE IDEA ORIGINATED BEFORE
THE ACTUAL CREATING BEGAN,

03:18.007 --> 03:20.010
RESULTING IN TOTAL ORIGINATION

03:20.012 --> 03:22.013
OF ALL CREATIVITY.

03:22.015 --> 03:25.009
- UH, I DIDN'T GET THAT
THE FIRST TIME.

03:25.011 --> 03:26.019
CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?

03:26.021 --> 03:28.012
HA HA HA.

03:28.014 --> 03:30.021
HA HA HA.

03:30.023 --> 03:33.001
- I'M SORRY, MOJO,

03:33.003 --> 03:36.024
BUT YOUR CREATION WAS DESTROYED
BY THE POWERPUFF GIRLS,

03:36.026 --> 03:38.027
AND WOULD PROBABLY STILL
BE DESTROYED

03:38.029 --> 03:42.011
IF I DIDN'T REVIVE THEM.

03:42.013 --> 03:43.013
BESIDES,

03:43.015 --> 03:46.023
SEEING HOW I MADE THEM BETTER...

03:48.018 --> 03:51.017
THEY SHOULD REMAIN MINE.

03:51.019 --> 03:53.010
- BETTER?

03:53.012 --> 03:57.024
HOW CAN YOU MAKE MOJO JOJO'S
DESIGN OF THE ROWDY ROUGH BOYS
ANY BETTER?

03:57.026 --> 04:02.023
- HA HA HA.

04:02.025 --> 04:07.017
BY MAKING THEM IMMUNE TO
THE POWERPUFFS' GIRLY KISSES.

04:07.019 --> 04:13.010
NOW THEY CAN'T BE DESTROYED BY
THE MERE TOUCH OF COOTIES.

04:13.012 --> 04:17.011
SO WHY DON'T YOU RUN ALONG,
CHIMP CHUMP?

04:19.018 --> 04:22.029
- THOSE BOYS WERE CREATED TO DO
PURE EVIL,

04:23.001 --> 04:24.022
WHICH MAKES ME
THE MORE FIT FATHER

04:24.024 --> 04:28.008
SINCE I AM PURE EVIL!

04:28.010 --> 04:31.012

04:31.014 --> 04:33.011
BUT NOBODY DOES EVIL

04:33.013 --> 04:35.005

THE ORIGINAL CREATOR OF

04:52.004 --> 04:53.021
WHO WERE ORIGINALLY CREATED
BY ME,

04:53.023 --> 04:55.018
AM THE MORE EVIL FATHER,

04:55.020 --> 04:57.013
YOU LEAVE ME NO ALTERNATIVE

04:57.015 --> 05:00.006
BUT TO PROVE
THAT I AM THE MORE EVIL FATHER,

05:00.008 --> 05:02.027
THEREFORE MAKING ME
THE BETTER PARENT!
