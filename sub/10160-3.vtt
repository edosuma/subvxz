00:01.293 --> 00:03.253
Previously
on When Calls the Heart...

00:03.253 --> 00:04.922
Thought we were going
for a ride after school.

00:04.922 --> 00:05.798
You had company.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.800
[Elizabeth]
I told him "no," Jack.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.051
You've always been
very kind to me.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.136
I always will be, Nora.

00:11.136 --> 00:16.183
I could consider entertaining
your romantic attentions.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.060
Houston's the one who's dirty,
not me.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.437
You almost died.

00:20.437 --> 00:23.064
I didn't always work
on the right side of the law.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.733
-What's your name?
-Cody.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.610
-What are they doing here?
-We just want to help.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.987
Do you think that
Cody could stay with you

00:27.987 --> 00:28.821
until I get better?

00:28.821 --> 00:31.198
Well, how could I
say no to that?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.199
[Jack and Elizabeth chuckling]

00:32.199 --> 00:34.075
Okay,
where are we going?

00:34.075 --> 00:35.285
It's a surprise!

00:35.285 --> 00:36.328
What kind of surprise?

00:36.328 --> 00:38.163
A good one!

00:38.163 --> 00:39.623
[sighs anxiously]

00:39.623 --> 00:41.291
So what do you think?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.460
Of Abigail's
old house?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.420
I'm thinking
of renting it.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.839
Doesn't Joe Craddock
live here?

00:46.839 --> 00:49.090
He just took a job
in Cape Fullerton.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.009
And with Clara here,

00:50.009 --> 00:52.051
Abigail could really
use the extra space.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.016
But the real reason is...

00:58.017 --> 01:00.101
It's time for me
to put down roots here.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.812
Hope Valley is my home.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.439
And it's the place I love.

01:04.439 --> 01:07.568
And the people
you love, right?

01:08.527 --> 01:10.070
You could say that.

01:14.199 --> 01:17.036
[sighs happily]

01:21.122 --> 01:22.374
[footsteps]

01:22.374 --> 01:24.001
Sorry to interrupt.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.084
I need your opinion.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.127
Sure.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.629
Green? Or blue?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.130
Are you trying
to impress someone?

01:29.130 --> 01:31.633
No, but I'm working with
Abigail at the cafe tomorrow.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.677
Has anyone seen
my baseball glove?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.262
Have you checked
your bedroom?

01:35.262 --> 01:36.638
It was in here
before supper.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.891
So? What do you think?

01:38.891 --> 01:41.268
Um, the green one.
It brings out your eyes.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.394
Thank you.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.145
Well, Cody, let's give
Elizabeth some privacy.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.731
She has a lot
of work to do.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.900
Have you seen
my baseball glove?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.276
-Don't you have homework?
-Oh, he'll get to it.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.402
Come on, let's
look upstairs.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.528
He wants to practice

01:51.528 --> 01:52.905
so he gets as good
as the other boys.

01:52.905 --> 01:55.156
Just as long as he studies
for his arithmetic test.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.117
He will.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.037
[weary sigh]

02:00.037 --> 02:01.162
Ah!

02:01.162 --> 02:02.205
There she is.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.749
Our dedicated
teacher--

02:03.749 --> 02:05.626
burning
the midnight oil.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.502
Oh... Marco Polo?

02:07.502 --> 02:10.213
The thrill
of discovery!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.674
Of new and uncharted
territory.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.301
An explorer's
epic journey

02:14.301 --> 02:15.385
into the unknown.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.805
-The mystery--
-Rosemary.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.974
Sorry. I was hoping you could
help me with something.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.475
You know, now is really
not a good time.

02:21.475 --> 02:22.434
This won't
take a moment.

02:22.434 --> 02:23.518
I was wondering

02:23.518 --> 02:24.937
if you could give me
a few classic quotes

02:24.937 --> 02:27.314
on love and rejection
for my advice column.

02:27.314 --> 02:30.901
Something...
like Coleridge or...

02:30.901 --> 02:32.111
Wordsworth!

02:32.111 --> 02:33.487
I'm a little rusty
on the classics,

02:33.487 --> 02:36.031
and you're so good with
all those dusty old poets.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.198
Sorry, Rosie.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.284
Elizabeth has plans.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.786
Oh. She does?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.456
Oh. Right!
I almost forgot.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.667
Uh, I'm sorry.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.209
Maybe another time?

02:48.209 --> 02:49.962
Of course.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.631
What plans?

02:52.631 --> 02:54.842
Private plans.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.177
[♪♪♪]

03:03.725 --> 03:05.769
This is
just what I needed.

03:05.769 --> 03:07.479
An evening in jail?

03:07.479 --> 03:09.773
An evening with you.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.525
Well, it's not exactly
dinner at the Ritz.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.735
It's the company
that counts.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.863
[door opening]

03:15.863 --> 03:17.823
I'm sorry,
I'm interrupting.

03:17.823 --> 03:21.326
Well, that's okay.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.162
Can I borrow some
of your shoe polish?

03:23.162 --> 03:24.245
Uh, yeah.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.497
You got a date too?

03:25.497 --> 03:26.999
Not exactly.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.249
Meeting with the Pinkertons
in the morning.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.377
I thought you were only
taking a leave of absence

03:30.377 --> 03:31.670
from the Mounties.

03:31.670 --> 03:34.631
I might as well hear
what they have to say.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.842
Those rolls
look awful good.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.259
Would you like some?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.555
That's awful nice
of you, Elizabeth.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.931
Thanks.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.099
Jack.

03:47.019 --> 03:50.271
[Bill banging around
in the back]

03:51.982 --> 03:54.109
To a romantic
evening together.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.277
One of these days.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.988
[both chuckling]
[clink]

[ruckus continues]

04:01.783 --> 04:04.285
[♪♪♪]

04:23.304 --> 04:24.305
Miss Thatcher?

04:25.015 --> 04:25.933
Hmm?

04:25.933 --> 04:28.102
How come Laura got an "A"
and I got a "C"?

04:28.102 --> 04:30.062
Well, what's the first rule
of writing essays?

04:30.062 --> 04:32.022
You have to separate ideas
into paragraphs,

04:32.022 --> 04:33.440
and yours was just
one long paragraph.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.900
[students giggling]

04:39.320 --> 04:40.822
Cody.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.323
You are 20 minutes late.

04:42.323 --> 04:45.326
Mrs. Stanton said I could
practice pitching before school.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.620
"Before school."

04:46.620 --> 04:47.662
You still have to be here
when the bell rings.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.414
She said it would be okay.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.874
Well, I think
you misunderstood her.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.835
Now...

04:53.835 --> 04:57.131
who can tell me about
The Travels of Marco Polo ?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.260
It's too terrible
about Silas.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.343
I just feel sick.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.345
I can't believe
he's gone.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.222
What happened?

05:05.222 --> 05:07.348
Silas Ramsey
was killed in a robbery.

05:07.348 --> 05:09.350
Oh, no.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.351
Poor Dottie.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.520
She gets home
from the funeral today.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.355
Have they caught
the men who did it?

05:14.355 --> 05:16.233
No. Not yet.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.359
But I'm confident
that they will.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.445
Ladies.

05:23.364 --> 05:26.367
I hope Dottie knows
we'll be there for her.

05:26.367 --> 05:29.329
Nobody should go through
something like this alone.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.374
I put the last box
in the pantry.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.002
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Mrs. Stanton?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.254
I can't think
of anything.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.964
You know,
your sink is leaking.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.423
I can take a look at it
after work.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.508
Are you sure
you have time?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.468
Will only take a few minutes.

05:44.636 --> 05:46.638
That dress
matches your eyes.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.473
Thanks.

[♪♪♪]

05:57.356 --> 05:58.399
[door shuts]

05:58.399 --> 05:59.693
I expected
more customers.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.278
Excuse me.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.032
The breakfast rush ends
before first shift at the mill.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.034
Ah. Could I see a menu?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.409
We don't print menus.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.538
No menus.
No customers.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.498
[sniffs and huffs]

06:13.498 --> 06:15.042
[aghast]
What is that smell?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.794
My buttermilk biscuits,
and if you don't like them,

06:17.794 --> 06:19.420
the saloon serves
beans and coffee.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.637
Mr. Humphries
isn't here to eat.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.639
Then why all the questions?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.599
Well, you've finally
gotten your wish.

06:31.599 --> 06:35.312
I'm selling
my interest in the cafe.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.564
He's going to be
your new partner.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.399
[♪♪♪]

06:42.443 --> 06:44.363
If there's anything
we can do--

06:44.363 --> 06:45.446
You're too kind.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.698
Anything at all.

06:46.698 --> 06:47.908
I'll be fine.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.580
Mrs. Ramsey.
I'm so sorry.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.582
May I help you
with your bags?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.125
I'd appreciate that.
Thank you.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.211
I didn't know
your husband well,

06:59.211 --> 07:01.963
but I understand
he was a good man.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.925
I don't wish to speak
ill of the dead,

07:04.925 --> 07:08.262
but I think we both know
my husband was no saint.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.056
Even so, he shouldn't
have died that way.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.183
I've contacted
the regional office.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.227
They've assigned
an inspector,

07:15.227 --> 07:17.187
but I'm going to
look into it myself.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.521
Thank you.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.606
But aren't you
on leave?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.857
I am.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.401
But this isn't
just any case.

07:22.401 --> 07:25.653
Saint or no saint,
Silas deserves justice,

07:25.653 --> 07:28.031
and for that matter,
so do you.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.700
[Lee] Well, that is
quite the undertaking.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.910
[Jack] I built a church,

07:31.910 --> 07:33.494
pretty sure
I can handle a house.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.621
Yeah, but this isn't
just any house

07:34.621 --> 07:35.872
we're talking about.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.874
Where-- Where are you
planning on building, exactly?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.500
Well, you know
Clem Besser's plot,

07:39.500 --> 07:40.627
on the way to Jameson?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.212
Oh, yeah, it's a nice
view from up there.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.671
Yeah, it's the best
in the valley.

07:43.671 --> 07:47.384
So... how much?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.386
What, for the lumber
you're gonna need, to build?

07:49.386 --> 07:50.387
Yeah.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.055
Uh, well, let me
draw up an estimate

07:52.055 --> 07:53.432
and I'll get
back to you.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.515
[Rosemary] Lee!

07:54.515 --> 07:55.600
-That's great. Thanks.
-No, no, no. No. Stay, stay.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.643
There you are.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.685
-Oh, Jack!
-Hi.

07:57.685 --> 07:58.937
I don't mean
to interrupt,

07:58.937 --> 08:00.063
but I have a quick
update for you.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.148
It won't take
a minute.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.024
First,
I asked the crew

08:03.024 --> 08:04.901
to clear space
for the new inventory.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.736
Second, I convinced
the Hudson boys

08:06.736 --> 08:09.448
to sweep under
that, uh...

08:09.448 --> 08:11.783
oh, the-the big thing
with the saw.

08:11.783 --> 08:12.742
The head saw?

08:12.742 --> 08:13.785
Yes! Head saw.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.412
Silly name. Third.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.997
Mrs. Weiss has
generously agreed

08:16.997 --> 08:18.999
to serve afternoon
refreshments.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.959
You always say a happy crew
is a productive crew.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.543
So we want a happy
crew, don't we?

08:22.543 --> 08:24.212
Yes. Yes, we do.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.588
[giggles]

08:25.588 --> 08:26.840
Rosemary has decided to help
with the mill for a while.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.799
Isn't that great?

08:27.799 --> 08:28.800
Great.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.968
Yeah.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.011
I thought you had
your hands full

08:31.011 --> 08:32.553
with the advice column?

08:32.553 --> 08:34.806
I do, but Lee has been
so busy here at the mill,

08:34.806 --> 08:35.974
working like a dog.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.143
Well, it's
the least I could do.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.560
She could do less.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.271
Well! If you need me,

08:41.271 --> 08:42.605
I will be
at the Mercantile,

08:42.605 --> 08:43.940
picking up
a few things.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.566
You are going to love what
I'm doing to your office!

08:45.566 --> 08:48.278
Okay! Whoa, wait!
What are you doing to my office?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.570
What is
she doing to my office?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.406
I don't know,
but good luck with that.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.116
Thanks, Lee.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.160
You on your way
to Dottie's?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.245
I thought I'd bring
her a lemon cake.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.788
It's the least
I could do.

08:58.788 --> 09:01.666
Mind if I join you?

09:01.666 --> 09:05.003
I wouldn't
mind at all.

09:05.003 --> 09:08.507
Ask Ned Yost to order
the fabric we spoke about--

09:08.507 --> 09:09.590
the velour, in red.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.801
Or maroon, actually,
if they have it.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.595
I'll need about 20 yards.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.264
Better make it 30.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.641
Yes. 30 should do.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.018
Mr. Coulter's okay
with this?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.603
Of course he is.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.731
Hey.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.233
Where's he going?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.318
He's helping me
redecorate.

09:28.318 --> 09:31.530
I think it's plenty
decorated as it is.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.655
Oh! Lee. No.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.740
This is just
the beginning.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.991
Picture it...

09:34.991 --> 09:38.370
A raised mahogany
desk and chair.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.955
Thick curtains
on either side.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.332
Three lights...

09:42.332 --> 09:45.043
shining down on you
from above.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.045
It'll be an office
fit for a king.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.839
And why exactly do I
need a "raised" desk?

09:49.839 --> 09:50.965
Well, you're the boss!

09:50.965 --> 09:53.634
The man in charge.
The fearless leader!

09:53.634 --> 09:55.345
This desk
is your stage,

09:55.345 --> 09:57.013
and you speak
with authority

09:57.013 --> 09:58.681
when you are looking
down from above.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.225
I like my office
the way it is.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.684
I'm just trying to
breathe some life

10:01.684 --> 10:04.645
into this dingy,
old dungeon,

10:04.645 --> 10:06.647
which it
desperately needs.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.648
Where's my map?

10:07.648 --> 10:08.900
Which map?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.193
What do you mean,
"which map"? My map!

10:10.193 --> 10:11.778
The big map that was
right here on this wall?

10:11.778 --> 10:12.904
Oh, that tattered
old thing?

10:12.904 --> 10:13.988
I threw it out.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.656
-You what?
-Well, don't worry.

10:15.656 --> 10:18.493
I ordered you a new one
from the survey office.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.994
You'll love it!
It's in color.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.662
Rosemary, that map

10:21.662 --> 10:23.664
had all of my harvest schedules
written on it.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.292
Well, I'm sure
it's written down somewhere.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.543
Oh, and before I forget--

10:26.543 --> 10:28.669
I gave Glen Butterfield
the rest of the day off.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.671
You-- whoa. Whoa, wait.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.672
What do you mean,

10:31.672 --> 10:33.674
you gave him
the rest of the day off?

10:33.674 --> 10:34.968
Well, of course,
I told him

10:34.968 --> 10:36.094
it was your idea.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.678
You are the boss.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.139
Sometimes,
I wonder about that.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.223
He and his wife,

10:40.223 --> 10:41.516
they had
a terrible argument.

10:41.516 --> 10:42.767
She told me about it
in a letter to my column.

10:42.767 --> 10:46.146
Oh, she poured her heart
out to me, the poor dear.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.606
They need the afternoon
to make up.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.399
You do want happy
workers now, don't you?

10:49.399 --> 10:50.733
Well, yes...

10:50.733 --> 10:52.152
yes, I do want
happy workers,

10:52.152 --> 10:53.694
but if they're not here,

10:53.694 --> 10:56.323
they're technically
not workers, right?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.866
[giggling]
Oh, you're funny!

10:58.866 --> 11:01.244
I do need to get going.
So much to do!

11:01.244 --> 11:03.121
But I'll be back later--
with some accessories!

11:03.121 --> 11:04.998
They add such a nice
finishing touch.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.333
[door bangs shut]

11:06.333 --> 11:08.168
What just happened?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.837
Well, it's almost
lunchtime at the cafe.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.255
I better get back.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.715
I think you should
take some time off.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.717
[laughs] I have to work.

11:16.717 --> 11:19.596
Aw, even the Man Upstairs took
a break on the seventh day.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.555
He earned it.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.641
Well, so have you.
I'll tell you what.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.267
Why don't I come by
after dinner,

11:24.267 --> 11:26.019
take a little walk
around the pond.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.061
Just half an hour.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.313
Give us a chance to catch up.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.566
It doesn't take half an hour
to walk around the pond.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.734
We'll walk slow.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.694
[chuckling]

11:38.990 --> 11:42.243
[♪♪♪]

11:42.243 --> 11:44.496
So, Pastor...

11:44.496 --> 11:46.789
how are you
and Miss Abigail doing?

11:46.789 --> 11:48.041
That's none
of your business.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.292
She got money?

11:49.292 --> 11:50.960
What do you
want, Jesse?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.837
Well, the gang's
back together again.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.255
There's a job coming up.
We'll need you.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.756
You're the best
powder man around.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.841
I'm not interested.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.051
Come on, Matt.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.135
You'd make so much money,

11:59.135 --> 12:00.303
you wouldn't
have to worry about

12:00.303 --> 12:01.513
keeping up this act
any longer.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.764
You could go anywhere,
do anything you want.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.600
I'm happy living right here,
doing just what I'm doing.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.310
Great. When
it's over, come back,

12:07.310 --> 12:08.769
get married,
have nine kids.

12:08.769 --> 12:09.770
You're not listening.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.938
I'm out.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.358
You're never out.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.193
You don't want to disappoint
Jake Garrison, do you?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.403
Is that a threat?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.488
Just saying, people
get hurt sometimes.

12:20.031 --> 12:23.410
Let me apologize about
dinner at the jail.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.453
It's the thought
that counts.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.371
I know.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.955
I want to make it
up to you, though.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.165
How?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.791
A snack
in the stables?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.751
Jack! [laughs]

12:34.170 --> 12:35.547
Even better...

12:35.547 --> 12:37.798
I have a place where
we can have dinner

12:37.798 --> 12:39.050
any time we like.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.678
Well, yeah. Abigail's?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.762
No... Elizabeth's.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.433
The row house?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.767
As of this morning,
it's mine.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.776
So I saved some extra money
from my teaching salary

12:57.776 --> 12:58.819
by living at Abigail's,

12:58.819 --> 13:00.405
and the rent here
isn't very much,

13:00.405 --> 13:02.365
so I thought, why not?

13:02.365 --> 13:03.533
Besides,
with Cody and Clara here,

13:03.533 --> 13:05.201
Abigail could
really use the extra room.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.994
And now that I finally
have some peace and quiet,

13:06.994 --> 13:08.663
I can start writing again.

13:08.663 --> 13:11.124
Old Joe Craddock didn't really
take care of this place

13:11.124 --> 13:12.917
as well as Abigail did,

13:12.917 --> 13:15.712
but it'll make a fine house
one day.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.218
Loose doorknob and all.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.928
But it's my loose doorknob.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.309
Clara!
Are my blueberry muffins ready?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.644
I know I'm early,

13:30.644 --> 13:32.853
but I promised to serve tea
at the mill in an hour.

13:32.853 --> 13:33.938
I'll get them
for you.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.940
Ooh. Cave Junction.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.858
I've heard of that.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.193
That's where the stage
was robbed-- [gasps]

13:39.193 --> 13:42.363
...and Dottie's husband
was killed.

13:42.363 --> 13:44.823
Oh. Such a terrible tragedy.

13:44.823 --> 13:46.284
Are you on the case?

13:46.284 --> 13:48.620
Maybe. And maybe not.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.871
Can I trust you
with that, Rosemary?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.999
You have my word.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.833
I won't say a peep
to anyone.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.795
Bless you.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.798
-Abigail.
-Bill.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.760
Are you aware
the sink is leaking?

14:03.760 --> 14:05.886
[exhales heavily]

14:05.886 --> 14:06.887
Yes.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.516
You'll need to get it fixed.
Immediately.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.268
I've made
a list of improvements.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.438
You'll be expected
to cover half the costs.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.064
There is nothing wrong
with the stove.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.399
It's only a matter of time

14:18.399 --> 14:20.901
until that antique
stops working.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.862
And when it does,
I will get a new one.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.741
You'll get one now.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.414
Before you close
your deal with Mr. Humphries,

14:33.414 --> 14:34.915
I would like to make
a counteroffer.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.376
You've already told me
that you don't have

14:36.376 --> 14:37.794
the funds
to buy me out.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.546
I don't.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.922
But maybe we can come up with
some kind of arrangement,

14:41.922 --> 14:43.924
something that would be
beneficial to you.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.885
I'm listening.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.929
I could make monthly payments,
with interest,

14:48.929 --> 14:50.097
until your share is paid.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.307
That's more than fair.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.394
I'm a businessman,
Mrs. Stanton.

14:54.394 --> 14:58.398
Unfortunately, uh...
you're not an acceptable risk.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.901
[♪♪♪]

15:04.445 --> 15:06.197
I can pick up some varnish
from the mercantile,

15:06.197 --> 15:07.907
if you want to start
on those floors tonight.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.158
Thank you,

15:09.158 --> 15:12.161
but I would like to do
the repairs myself.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.955
At least let me help you
move your things in.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.541
I'll take you up on that.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.210
Thank you.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.503
-Elizabeth--
-Hi.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.880
I just spoke to Cody,

15:21.880 --> 15:24.507
and he said
you held him after class.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.300
I didn't want to,
but he was late again,

15:26.300 --> 15:28.052
for the third time
this week.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.679
He practices baseball
before school.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.180
He just wants
to fit in.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.973
He still needs
to be on time.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.851
Well, boys will be boys.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.686
They still have to
get to school on time.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.522
Well, it's a big
adjustment for him.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.232
Abigail, it's not
just his attendance.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.776
He doesn't pay attention

15:42.776 --> 15:44.861
and he hasn't
turned in his homework.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.363
He's having a hard time
being back in school,

15:47.363 --> 15:49.031
after everything
he's been through.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.950
He needs to try
a little harder.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.495
You think I'm being
too easy on him?

15:54.495 --> 15:57.331
I think you're being
over-protective,

15:57.331 --> 15:59.083
and I understand why.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.210
I just don't think
it's helping him.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.964
Well, thank you
for your opinion.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.967
Abigail, we all want
what's best for Cody,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.469
and you're doing
everything you can.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.011
I'm just trying to help.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.972
I know you are.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.684
[♪♪♪]

16:18.018 --> 16:20.271
It's not that I'm surprised
she moved out on her own,

16:20.271 --> 16:22.398
I-I just didn't think
it would happen so soon.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.024
Mm, and you're not sure
how you feel about it?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.902
[sighs] Look, I like

16:25.902 --> 16:28.279
that she's an independent
woman, but...

16:28.279 --> 16:30.114
This doesn't have
anything to do with

16:30.114 --> 16:31.908
that house you want
to build, does it?

16:31.908 --> 16:32.951
Maybe.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.452
Ah!

16:34.452 --> 16:35.662
Look, I'd take it
as a good sign.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.706
Means she's putting down
roots here in Hope Valley.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.960
Moving away
from Hamilton.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.169
Well, then that's
a very good sign.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.462
You bet it is.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.130
Women like to make
a place their own.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.674
It's called "nesting."

16:47.674 --> 16:49.049
-It's "nesting"?
-Nesting!

16:49.049 --> 16:52.345
You know, today, you know,
Elizabeth moves into her place.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.429
Down the road,

16:53.429 --> 16:55.473
maybe she moves
into yours.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.975
Just be patient,

16:56.975 --> 16:58.893
and buy her a nice
housewarming gift.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.770
Huh?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.730
All right.

17:03.523 --> 17:08.068
[♪♪♪]

17:08.068 --> 17:10.488
So... what do you think?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.949
[♪♪♪]

17:16.076 --> 17:17.996
"Nesting."

17:19.246 --> 17:21.749
[♪♪♪]

17:23.334 --> 17:25.503
[forced chuckle]

17:31.425 --> 17:33.553
My worldly possessions!

17:33.553 --> 17:34.679
[Jack chuckles]

17:34.679 --> 17:37.097
Those who would travel happily,

17:37.097 --> 17:38.140
must travel light.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.769
At least I have
a desk to write on.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.103
Hmm...

17:43.103 --> 17:46.983
Something's missing.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.194
[♪♪♪]

17:50.194 --> 17:52.822
What is this?

17:52.822 --> 17:55.157
It's a housewarming gift.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.119
Is it an ice box?
I could really use an ice box.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.914
Just open it.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.001
Oh, Jack.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.502
It's gorgeous.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.088
Now I just need to
get you some flowers.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.550
It's perfect just as it is.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.052
Just like you.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.099
[♪♪♪]

18:21.141 --> 18:23.143
I've been thinking
about what you said,

18:23.143 --> 18:24.144
about moving here.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.897
And?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.356
I'd have to go
home for a while

18:27.356 --> 18:29.025
and finish up
a few things.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.151
Well, take whatever time
you need.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.152
If everything works out,

18:32.152 --> 18:33.780
I should be back
in a month or so.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.990
Well, I will be here.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.036
Henry, I'm uneasy
about something.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.580
Does it have
to do with Bill?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.582
No. We've signed
the divorce papers.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.166
That's over.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.753
But if I'm going to
make Hope Valley my home,

18:48.753 --> 18:50.838
I need to apologize
to Abigail Stanton.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.799
That wasn't your fault.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.593
It wasn't hers, either.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.514
Frank? I thought
we were going for a walk.

19:00.514 --> 19:02.683
Plan changed.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.477
Oh. Maybe tomorrow?

19:04.477 --> 19:07.063
No, tomorrow's no good.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.230
Sunday?

19:08.230 --> 19:09.523
Sunday won't work.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.984
Frank, I'm confused.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.111
You said you wanted
to catch up.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.155
[sighs heavily]
It'll have to wait.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.825
Oh. Well--

19:18.825 --> 19:21.160
I'm sorry to bother you.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.206
[Elizabeth]
For our science project,

19:26.206 --> 19:29.209
we are going
to plant beans in cans

19:29.209 --> 19:32.212
and learn about photosynthesis.

19:32.212 --> 19:33.840
Now, since this is
a group project,

19:33.840 --> 19:36.216
I'd like
for you all to choose partners.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.760
Go on. Choose partners.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.847
Emily? Would you please
pass out the beans?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.140
Thank you.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.022
-Miss Thatcher?
-Mm?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.815
I don't
have a partner.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.775
Oh. Um...

19:52.775 --> 19:55.486
Well, you can be partners
with Miles and Robert.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.115
[♪♪♪]

19:59.115 --> 20:01.241
Everyone
has friends but me.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.243
You're new.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.579
It takes time to make
friends at a new school.

20:05.579 --> 20:08.290
[sighs] I don't want to
be partners with anyone.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.251
This isn't
a choice, Cody.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.504
Everyone
is going to participate.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.964
Come on.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.266
Find anything
at Cave Junction?

20:26.266 --> 20:27.267
Not much.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.020
A few hoof prints,
some spent casings.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.022
Jake Garrison and his gang
are suspects in the robbery,

20:31.022 --> 20:33.273
but HQ doesn't have enough
evidence for an arrest.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.317
I had a feeling
it was Garrison.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.987
What? You know him?

20:37.987 --> 20:40.073
I've chased him before.

20:40.073 --> 20:43.826
He killed a good friend of mine
in a bank robbery 10 years ago.

20:43.826 --> 20:45.036
Carl Benson.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.747
Left behind a widow
and an eight-year-old daughter.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.166
You never arrested him?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.918
No.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.627
Not enough evidence.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.255
This guy's an expert
at covering his tracks, Jack.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.298
He picks up a gang
when he needs one,

20:58.298 --> 20:59.425
then he lets them go
when he doesn't.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.761
They were spotted
near Albert Hills.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.554
That might mean
they're headed west.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.306
I'll help you on patrols.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.641
Can't be too careful.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.019
This mean you're gonna
turn down the Pinkertons?

21:10.019 --> 21:11.229
No, it means
the Garrison gang

21:11.229 --> 21:12.939
is not gonna get
anywhere near Hope Valley.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.611
Hi, Cody.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.948
I hate school.
I'm never going back.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.783
Tell me what happened.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.368
Nobody likes me.
I don't have any friends.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.328
Cody, you haven't
been here very long.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.289
You have to give it some time.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.331
At least
when we were on our own,

21:31.331 --> 21:32.374
I had Becky.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.335
Sweetheart,
I know you miss your sister,

21:35.335 --> 21:36.879
but, right now,

21:36.879 --> 21:39.339
she needs to be with
the doctors in Union City.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.341
They're helping her get better.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.343
When she gets better,
could I visit her?

21:43.343 --> 21:46.139
Of course you can.

21:46.139 --> 21:47.514
But until then,

21:47.514 --> 21:48.641
there are other ways

21:48.641 --> 21:49.892
to show someone that
you care about them.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.351
How?

21:51.351 --> 21:52.603
You could
write her a letter.

21:52.603 --> 21:55.397
Tell her all the things
that you would say to her

21:55.397 --> 21:57.357
if she was sitting
right next to you.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.734
Will you help me?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.360
[chuckles]

22:00.360 --> 22:02.947
Of course,I will.

22:04.615 --> 22:05.658
Hello.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.867
Dottie!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.536
It's good
to see you out.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.497
Does the Mayor have you
working already?

22:11.497 --> 22:14.041
No. He told me to take
the rest of the week off.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.459
Well, that was
nice of him.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.837
He's not all bad.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.379
You don't know him
the way I do.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.048
I know him all too well.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.050
Well, he could've fired me
when he was out of money,

22:23.050 --> 22:24.384
but he didn't.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.385
Trust me,

22:25.385 --> 22:27.345
there is another
side to Henry Gowen.

22:27.345 --> 22:30.224
Who's that man
he's with?

22:31.391 --> 22:32.726
Alan Humphries.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.313
He's buying Henry's
share of the cafe.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.106
I hadn't heard.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.399
You know anything
about him?

22:39.399 --> 22:41.401
Not very much.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.987
But, um...

22:42.987 --> 22:44.655
I have a feeling

22:44.655 --> 22:47.407
Abigail is going to miss
having Mayor Gowen as a partner.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.334
I have a very fun
writing assignment

22:56.334 --> 22:57.417
for all of you.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.377
I want you to think of a memory.

22:59.377 --> 23:00.713
Something from your past.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.507
It can be happy or sad.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.925
It can be funny or scary...

23:04.925 --> 23:07.803
It can be
any memory that you like.

23:07.803 --> 23:08.679
Yes, Emily?

23:08.679 --> 23:10.764
Can I write about
the fall harvest?

23:10.764 --> 23:12.474
My mom lets me pick
the biggest pumpkin,

23:12.474 --> 23:14.143
and we carve a jack-o'-lantern.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.103
That is a wonderful memory.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.481
Cody? Do you have
a favorite memory?

23:19.481 --> 23:21.359
It's stupid.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.735
No, it isn't!

23:22.735 --> 23:24.153
Well...

23:24.153 --> 23:26.739
my dad would say we were
soldiers in the Light Brigade.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.406
He's right.
That is stupid.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.449
Robert.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.492
Take it back!

23:30.492 --> 23:32.119
Whoa. That's enough, boys.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.622
Now apologize to one other.

23:35.622 --> 23:37.917
[both, overlapping]
Sorry.

23:41.337 --> 23:42.462
That's all for today,
everyone.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.964
I'll collect
your writing assignments

23:43.964 --> 23:45.925
tomorrow morning.
Class dismissed.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.885
Cody?

23:47.885 --> 23:49.845
[♪♪♪]

23:52.265 --> 23:54.516
You're not in trouble.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.895
[students filing out]

23:57.895 --> 23:59.813
Tell me the rest
of the story,

23:59.813 --> 24:01.774
about your dad
and the Light Brigade.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.026
We used to ride horses.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.528
I'm listening.

24:06.528 --> 24:09.031
He would say,

24:09.031 --> 24:12.868
"Honor the charge they made,
honor the Light Brigade."

24:14.536 --> 24:16.205
I was thinking,

24:16.205 --> 24:19.250
since you didn't turn in
your paper about Marco Polo,

24:19.250 --> 24:22.544
maybe you'd like to write about
the Charge of the Light Brigade?

24:22.544 --> 24:24.255
What do you think?

24:25.298 --> 24:26.799
Okay.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.009
Okay.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.304
[♪♪♪]

24:37.726 --> 24:38.769
Oh!

24:38.769 --> 24:39.603
For you.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.648
Oh...
Jesse, they're beautiful.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.692
I'm glad you like them,

24:45.692 --> 24:47.653
because I was actually
gonna ask you a favor.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.071
Oh? What kind of favor?

24:49.071 --> 24:50.656
I'm still trying
to find my way around,

24:50.656 --> 24:52.408
and I was wondering
if you could show me

24:52.408 --> 24:53.491
where the livery is.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.453
Didn't I see you
at the livery yesterday?

24:55.453 --> 24:56.829
Right. Ha.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.414
How about
the blacksmith?

24:58.414 --> 24:59.832
Around the corner
from the livery.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.584
It's a good place for it.
[awkward chuckle]

25:04.086 --> 25:08.007
Oh. Those are lovely.
What's the occasion?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.175
I was
asking Clara

25:09.175 --> 25:11.010
if she'd like to go
for a walk with me.

25:11.969 --> 25:15.181
I really need to
stay and help Abigail.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.556
Doesn't look
so busy.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.767
Can you manage
without her?

25:18.767 --> 25:20.769
I'll only
be gone an hour.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.812
Promise.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.024
Ma'am.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.319
[Lee]
And, most importantly,

25:28.319 --> 25:29.820
the stage.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.947
20 feet,
plenty of room in the wings,

25:31.947 --> 25:34.074
even a catwalk
with electric lighting.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.118
What? Only 20 feet?

25:36.118 --> 25:38.620
That's barely enough room
for Macbeth to die.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.957
But the smaller the stage,
the bigger you shine.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.126
True.

25:44.126 --> 25:45.585
Mm.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.171
I've changed my mind.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.589
This theater is perfect.
It's just the right size.

25:49.589 --> 25:50.716
That's my girl.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.634
I can't wait
for opening night.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.054
I'm going to dedicate
my first performance to you.

25:55.054 --> 25:58.098
Oh, and what have I done
to deserve such an honor?

25:58.098 --> 26:00.600
You're bringing culture
to our little hamlet.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.311
History will remember you

26:02.311 --> 26:03.479
as a great patron
of the arts.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.688
Oh.

26:04.688 --> 26:06.148
"Patron." Hmm.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.316
Just a patron, huh?

26:07.316 --> 26:09.485
Lee...

26:09.485 --> 26:11.611
You're making
my dreams come true.

26:11.611 --> 26:12.612
[chuckles]

26:12.612 --> 26:14.365
No one's ever done
anything like this

26:14.365 --> 26:15.615
for me before.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.495
Because no one's ever
felt for you the way that I do.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.626
You don't see country like this
where I come from.

26:26.626 --> 26:28.045
I don't think

26:28.045 --> 26:29.629
you told me
where you're from.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.631
Uh, small town back east.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.591
Family has a farm there.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.635
There's really not much to tell.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.970
So you came west

26:36.970 --> 26:39.098
in search of
fame and fortune?

26:39.098 --> 26:41.599
You hear that story a lot,
I guess.

26:43.643 --> 26:45.563
I'm going to ask you
a bold question,

26:45.563 --> 26:47.647
before I make a fool
out of myself.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.649
Should I
be worried?

26:49.649 --> 26:50.650
No, no,
nothing like that.

26:50.650 --> 26:52.528
I was just wondering,

26:52.528 --> 26:53.653
are there any other

26:53.653 --> 26:54.780
handsome, charming
gentlemen

26:54.780 --> 26:57.032
bringing you
flowers at work?

26:57.032 --> 27:00.119
You'll be happy to know
that was a first.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.124
[♪♪♪]

27:12.714 --> 27:15.509
[loud thudding]

27:22.682 --> 27:24.017
Ah. You got a good arm.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.769
But you need a better grip.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.069
See?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.695
And now you try it.

27:35.695 --> 27:38.698
There you go.

27:38.698 --> 27:39.825
[thud]

27:40.909 --> 27:42.411
Thanks, Mister!

27:42.411 --> 27:43.954
You keep
throwing like that,

27:43.954 --> 27:45.498
and they'll notice you
soon enough.

27:50.877 --> 27:51.669
[thud]

27:53.713 --> 27:55.508
[hushed exchange]

28:01.054 --> 28:02.722
Hello!
[gasps] Ha!

28:02.722 --> 28:04.141
[laughing]

28:04.141 --> 28:05.767
Don't you
look the part!

28:05.767 --> 28:07.186
Yet I have
somehow managed

28:07.186 --> 28:08.728
to make the creak
in this floorboard

28:08.728 --> 28:09.729
worse than ever.

28:09.729 --> 28:10.730
Impossible.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.358
It's always
been like that.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.775
Gosh, I've missed
this place.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.944
You have a lot of good
memories here, don't you?

28:15.944 --> 28:18.364
I do.
It looks different.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.324
Well, Mr. Craddock
was never one

28:20.324 --> 28:22.201
to concern himself
with appearance, was he?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.743
Apparently not.

28:23.743 --> 28:24.953
What's next
on your list?

28:24.953 --> 28:26.704
Oh, an ice box,

28:26.704 --> 28:27.665
fix the doorknob,

28:27.665 --> 28:29.749
clean the chimney,
a fresh coat of paint.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.585
Yep. I'm practically finished.

28:31.585 --> 28:33.962
Why don't I help you later?
We'll have a painting party.

28:33.962 --> 28:34.963
I would love that.

28:34.963 --> 28:35.964
I'll bring Cody.

28:35.964 --> 28:37.090
How's he doing?

28:37.090 --> 28:38.800
Good. I told him
he had to finish his essay

28:38.800 --> 28:39.968
before he went
out to play.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.428
He'll come around.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.763
Mm. I wish someone else
would come around.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.683
Frank?

28:45.683 --> 28:48.185
I thought something
was starting to happen

28:48.185 --> 28:49.269
between the two of us,

28:49.269 --> 28:50.604
but now nothing.

28:50.604 --> 28:52.105
You're really starting
to care for him, aren't you?

28:52.105 --> 28:54.774
Oh. Maybe more
than I should.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.902
-Muffin?
-Please.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.862
Fresh out
of the oven.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.322
These are so--
yes, they're good.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.781
-Blueberry!
-Mm-hmm.

29:01.781 --> 29:04.243
I've gotta be honest, Lee,
this is, uh...

29:04.243 --> 29:06.328
a little more
than I was expecting.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.872
And that is with
a sizeable discount

29:08.872 --> 29:10.082
because we're friends,

29:10.082 --> 29:11.291
but the house
that you're talking about

29:11.291 --> 29:12.834
isn't exactly a shanty.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.879
Trust me, I promise, it's gonna
be worth every penny.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.214
Okay.

29:17.214 --> 29:19.216
So I hear the architect
finished plans

29:19.216 --> 29:20.300
for Rosemary's
new theater.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.301
Uh, Hope Valley's theater...

29:21.301 --> 29:22.886
just don't tell her.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.304
[laughs] Right. Well,

29:24.304 --> 29:26.223
it seems like a pretty big
project to take on,

29:26.223 --> 29:27.558
right when
you're trying to double

29:27.558 --> 29:28.601
the size of your operation.

29:28.601 --> 29:31.937
Yeah, well, you know me.
I like big projects.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.524
See you, Jack.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.571
[boys]
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:40.571 --> 29:42.406
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

29:42.406 --> 29:45.033
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

29:45.033 --> 29:47.160
Hey! Hey!
What's going on here?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.828
Get up.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.748
What's happening?

29:50.748 --> 29:51.873
He started it!

29:51.873 --> 29:53.333
Liar!
He did!

29:53.333 --> 29:55.168
[boys panting]

29:55.168 --> 29:57.296
Okay. Robert, go home.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.632
Rest of you, too.
Go on now.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.054
You wanna tell me
what happened?

30:06.054 --> 30:07.306
He called me an orphan.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.558
So you hit him?

30:09.558 --> 30:11.059
Are you gonna
tell Mrs. Stanton?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.019
I should.

30:13.019 --> 30:14.854
But I'll tell you what.

30:14.854 --> 30:15.689
You go home,

30:15.689 --> 30:16.774
you go finish
your homework,

30:16.774 --> 30:18.776
no one else needs
to know about it.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.152
You promise
you won't tell?

30:20.152 --> 30:22.821
Yeah, I promise.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.867
Cody?

30:27.867 --> 30:30.287
No more fights.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.169
[footsteps]

30:37.169 --> 30:38.712
Well, Elizabeth Thatcher,
look at you.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.964
You're so...
capable-looking!

30:40.964 --> 30:42.966
Capable,
and a little overwhelmed.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.468
I had no idea
how much work

30:44.468 --> 30:45.636
went into
fixing up a house.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.555
The stove, the floors,
the painting...

30:48.555 --> 30:50.265
I thought you'd just
ask Jack to do all that.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.433
Well, he offered,

30:51.433 --> 30:53.018
but I'm trying to do it
all on my own.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.313
Men are peculiar creatures.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.440
They like to feel needed,
and important.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.899
I get letters about it
all the time.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.318
All right,

31:01.318 --> 31:02.902
but if I let Jack
take care of everything,

31:02.902 --> 31:03.903
what do I learn?

31:03.903 --> 31:04.904
How to hand him tools

31:04.904 --> 31:05.905
while he does
all the work?

31:05.905 --> 31:06.948
Oh, Elizabeth.
It's simple.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.534
Just give him
something else to do.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.743
As I tell my readers,

31:09.743 --> 31:12.788
"Keep your man busy,
so he isn't in a tizzy."

31:12.788 --> 31:13.789
[chuckles]

31:15.040 --> 31:16.916
[laughs]

31:16.916 --> 31:19.211
Frank.
We need to talk.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.046
I can't right now.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.841
Well, fine,
then just listen.

31:23.841 --> 31:26.218
I know you're keeping
something from me,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.428
and whatever it is,
no matter how bad it is,

31:28.428 --> 31:30.138
I've been
through worse.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.849
And one thing
I know...

31:31.849 --> 31:34.142
I couldn't have
made it on my own.

31:34.142 --> 31:36.061
So whenever
you're ready,

31:36.061 --> 31:37.354
I'm here.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.105
You don't have to
go through it alone.

31:39.105 --> 31:42.526
You have someone
you can lean on.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.319
I just hope
you remember that

31:44.319 --> 31:46.279
when the time comes.

31:46.279 --> 31:48.574
[♪♪♪]

31:56.956 --> 32:00.377
You got enough firewood
to last two winters.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.170
Glad to know
I'll stay warm.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.423
[exhales wearily]

32:04.423 --> 32:06.717
Well, there are...

32:06.717 --> 32:08.927
other ways
to stay warm.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.891
Um... a stove?

32:13.891 --> 32:16.602
A campfire, or...

32:16.602 --> 32:18.520
maybe even a blanket?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.564
That's not exactly
what I have in mind.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.316
Well...

32:23.316 --> 32:24.984
should I keep guessing,

32:24.984 --> 32:26.445
or are you going to
get more firewood?

32:26.445 --> 32:29.322
No, no, I stacked
the rest of it out the back.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.157
[both laughing]

32:31.157 --> 32:33.368
Are you sure
I can't give you

32:33.368 --> 32:35.245
a hand with
anything else?

32:35.245 --> 32:37.205
As a matter of fact,

32:37.205 --> 32:38.957
I do have
a small favor to ask.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.542
Well, name it.

32:41.585 --> 32:44.045
There's a big spider,
behind the bed, upstairs.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.130
Do you think
you could catch it

32:45.130 --> 32:46.924
and put it outside?

32:46.924 --> 32:48.759
-Spider?
-Mm-hmm.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.969
Maybe even
a family of spiders.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.971
Two, or-or...

32:52.971 --> 32:54.013
even three.

32:54.013 --> 32:55.974
And-And you know how much
I hate spiders.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.895
I do.

32:59.895 --> 33:02.230
"Keep your man busy
and he won't be in a tizzy."

33:02.230 --> 33:04.441
I read Rosemary's column, too.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.987
[♪♪♪]

33:25.545 --> 33:27.005
Are you looking for this?

33:29.215 --> 33:31.009
[hammer cocks]

33:32.552 --> 33:34.137
[laughs] I'm just--

33:34.137 --> 33:36.055
I'm just messing with you.

33:36.055 --> 33:37.015
[laughing]

33:38.391 --> 33:39.768
What do you want, Sonny?

33:39.768 --> 33:42.437
Well, Jake asked me to stop by,
see how you're doing.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.772
[bullets rattling]

33:43.772 --> 33:45.691
He wants to know if you made
any progress with Matt.

33:45.691 --> 33:49.486
Tell Jake I'm doing
the best I can.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.779
Why don't you tell him?

33:55.200 --> 33:56.201
[takes a breath]

33:56.201 --> 33:57.452
That gold train's

33:57.452 --> 34:00.246
gonna be coming in through
Albert Hills real soon.

34:00.246 --> 34:01.707
Tick-tock.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.252
I'll take care of it.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.588
Yeah. You better.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.049
You promised me Matt Landry.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.134
I don't like it when someone
welches on a promise.

34:13.134 --> 34:15.512
[♪♪♪]

34:20.058 --> 34:22.060
[♪♪♪]

34:23.311 --> 34:25.522
[metal scraping]

34:26.773 --> 34:29.108
Bill, what are
you doing here?

34:29.108 --> 34:31.110
Making breakfast.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.821
With my pans and my eggs?

34:32.821 --> 34:34.113
Actually...

34:34.113 --> 34:36.909
they're "our" pans
and "our" eggs.

34:36.909 --> 34:37.993
Excuse me?

34:37.993 --> 34:39.118
I'm your new partner.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.580
I bought Gowen's share
of the cafe.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.581
You--
You did what?

34:42.581 --> 34:44.374
I'm always looking
for a good investment,

34:44.374 --> 34:45.876
and I heard his half
was up for sale,

34:45.876 --> 34:46.960
so I grabbed it.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.670
Without asking me first?

34:48.670 --> 34:51.214
I'm not here
to cause any trouble, Abigail.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.966
I'm just a smart investor.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.927
I don't know...
This is a bit much.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.135
I need to think about it.

34:56.135 --> 34:59.472
Well, it seems to me
that I'm your best option.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.473
Oh, really?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.641
Well,
I'm not here

35:01.641 --> 35:03.101
to give you a list of things
that you need to fix,

35:03.101 --> 35:04.436
like Humphries did.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.395
Took me

35:05.395 --> 35:06.897
about 10 minutes
to try to figure out

35:06.897 --> 35:08.147
how to light this stove,

35:08.147 --> 35:09.566
so, trust me,
I have no interest

35:09.566 --> 35:12.736
in sticking my nose
into your day-to-day operations.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.404
So you'll be
a silent partner?

35:14.404 --> 35:16.114
In every way.

35:17.657 --> 35:18.992
Well, I think

35:18.992 --> 35:22.203
I'm going to enjoy
owning this place...

35:22.203 --> 35:24.790
as much as I enjoy eating here.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.044
So...

35:33.673 --> 35:36.593
We're good...

35:36.593 --> 35:37.844
partner?

35:49.188 --> 35:51.190
All right,
I have something for you,

35:51.190 --> 35:52.567
before you go.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.778
What's this?

35:56.195 --> 35:58.991
Oh... Henry!

35:58.991 --> 36:00.450
It's beautiful.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.744
Do you remember
what you said to me

36:02.744 --> 36:03.870
the first time
we met?

36:03.870 --> 36:06.539
You were having lunch
with some friends of yours

36:06.539 --> 36:08.541
at the restaurant across
the street from my office.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.044
It was my first day
at the mining company.

36:11.044 --> 36:12.587
And you strolled over

36:12.587 --> 36:14.798
in your new suit
and your shiny, black shoes,

36:14.798 --> 36:16.008
and you asked,

36:16.008 --> 36:17.216
"Do you happen
to have the time?"

36:17.216 --> 36:19.761
Mm-hmm. And you pointed
to the clock tower behind me.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.888
[laughs]
That was mean of me.

36:21.888 --> 36:24.349
Maybe so,
but you, uh...

36:24.349 --> 36:26.225
you know, from here on in,
wherever you go,

36:26.225 --> 36:28.478
you, uh,
you'll always have the time.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.692
Thank you, Henry.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.652
Pleasure.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.498
Hurry back.

36:48.498 --> 36:51.334
[♪♪♪]

36:54.253 --> 36:55.922
Anything else
you need today?

36:55.922 --> 36:57.174
This'll do for now,

36:57.174 --> 36:59.258
just a few supplies
for Mr. Coulter's office.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.259
You can add them

37:00.259 --> 37:01.427
to Lee's
company account.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.555
I wish I could,
but I can't.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.140
Can't? Why not?

37:05.140 --> 37:06.599
Mr. Coulter's account
is overdue.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.935
Overdue?
No, that must be a mistake.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.020
I'm so sorry,

37:10.020 --> 37:11.688
but my father said
no more credit.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.274
How odd.
I wonder why Lee never told me.

37:15.274 --> 37:16.985
It doesn't matter.

37:16.985 --> 37:18.695
I'll just pay cash.

37:18.695 --> 37:19.863
[♪♪♪]

37:19.863 --> 37:20.947
Hello?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.157
Hey!

37:22.157 --> 37:23.241
We brought
new paint for you.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.617
Just in time!

37:24.617 --> 37:26.828
Wow.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.287
Cody?

37:28.287 --> 37:29.748
Would you like
to help us?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.624
No.

37:32.876 --> 37:37.005
Cody, put down the baseball
and help Miss Thatcher, please.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.297
Here, Cody.

37:38.297 --> 37:39.591
You can use this.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.300
No, thanks.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.301
[awkward chuckle]

37:42.301 --> 37:43.344
Once he puts
that glove on,

37:43.344 --> 37:45.222
he's lost
to the world.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.264
Men and sport--

37:46.264 --> 37:47.933
I'll never
understand it.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.726
All right, Cody.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.394
Why don't you tell us
about your essay

37:51.394 --> 37:52.979
on "the Charge
of the Light Brigade"?

37:52.979 --> 37:55.440
Oh, I love that poem.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.943
It's one
of my favorites.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.819
I haven't started.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.613
It's due tomorrow.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.200
Cody, enough of that.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.576
He'll do the essay
when we get home.

38:06.576 --> 38:07.953
I promise.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.412
[Cody]
Hey, Jack!

38:09.412 --> 38:11.330
-Catch!
-Whoa, whoa--

38:11.330 --> 38:12.540
[loud gasping
as shards clatter]

38:14.960 --> 38:16.335
Cody.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.213
What did
I tell you?

38:18.213 --> 38:21.340
Now, please,
get that broom

38:21.340 --> 38:22.968
and clean up this mess.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.343
I don't have to listen to you!

38:24.343 --> 38:26.345
Yes, you do.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.430
Cody, you need to
do as you're told.

38:27.430 --> 38:28.848
You're not my father!

38:28.848 --> 38:29.849
Cody!

38:31.476 --> 38:32.602
Abigail...

38:32.602 --> 38:34.980
I'll get him.

38:39.276 --> 38:41.069
Okay. Hey, hey! Hey!

38:41.069 --> 38:42.028
Let me go!

38:42.028 --> 38:43.196
No.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.363
I hate you!
I hate all of you!

38:44.363 --> 38:45.824
Hey, Cody.
No, you don't.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.617
You don't hate me.
You don't hate any of us.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.535
You're upset
because you miss your dad.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.121
It's why you won't
finish that essay.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.580
It's why you're getting
in fights.

38:52.580 --> 38:55.125
Because it hurts
to think about him,

38:55.125 --> 38:56.293
it hurts to be alone.

38:56.293 --> 38:58.377
It hurts to not have
the people that you love

38:58.377 --> 38:59.462
to tell you
it's gonna be okay.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.047
You don't know anything!

39:01.047 --> 39:02.799
Yeah, I do...

39:02.799 --> 39:04.217
I do.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.344
'Cause I lost my dad, too.

39:10.265 --> 39:11.975
[exhales]

39:11.975 --> 39:15.145
It feels like someone
took something from you...

39:16.395 --> 39:18.523
Like there's a giant hole
inside of you.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.484
But one day,
that-- that feeling

39:21.484 --> 39:23.402
that you're feeling
right now--

39:23.402 --> 39:26.405
that feeling
is gonna go away.

39:26.405 --> 39:28.366
I promise.

39:29.993 --> 39:32.204
It's not fair.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.789
No, it's not fair at all, kid.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.417
But just because your parents
aren't here,

39:38.417 --> 39:40.419
doesn't mean
they're not with you.

39:40.419 --> 39:43.089
You got 'em
right in here...

39:44.423 --> 39:46.718
Every moment

39:46.718 --> 39:48.678
of every day.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.347
Okay?

39:50.347 --> 39:52.431
[♪♪♪]

40:00.982 --> 40:02.483
[Elizabeth]
I can't describe how it feels

40:02.483 --> 40:04.485
to have my own home.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.239
Teaching will always
be first in my heart,

40:07.239 --> 40:08.531
but now that I'm settled in,

40:08.531 --> 40:11.450
I can finally pursue
my passion for writing.

40:11.450 --> 40:14.453
I want to capture the spirit
of this special place,

40:14.453 --> 40:15.454
of the love and the caring,

40:15.454 --> 40:18.457
so that I can share it
with the world.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.086
There's nowhere else on Earth
like Hope Valley,

40:21.086 --> 40:23.462
though I miss you
and Mother very much.

40:23.462 --> 40:25.257
With love and prayers,

40:25.257 --> 40:26.758
your devoted daughter,

40:26.758 --> 40:28.718
Elizabeth.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.722
[Cody]
"Honor the charge they made!"

40:32.722 --> 40:34.933
[both]
"Honor the Light Brigade!"

40:34.933 --> 40:36.475
Oh! [laughing]

40:36.475 --> 40:38.728
Is it too early
to be optimistic?

40:38.728 --> 40:39.771
You know,

40:39.771 --> 40:41.940
there are gonna be
good days and bad days.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.316
You're right,

40:43.316 --> 40:45.735
but I think
this is a good start.

40:46.819 --> 40:49.739
What you're doing
for Cody, Abigail,

40:49.739 --> 40:52.742
it reminds me of the thing
I admire most about you.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.160
What's that?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.494
You don't
give up on people.

40:55.494 --> 40:59.498
Oh, Elizabeth.
You're such a good friend.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.376
I'm gonna miss having
you under my roof.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.211
I will be
just down the street,

41:03.211 --> 41:04.212
and I'll see you
every day.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.213
You promise?

41:05.213 --> 41:06.214
I promise!

41:06.214 --> 41:07.465
