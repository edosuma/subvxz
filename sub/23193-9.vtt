WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.878
- LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.246
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.714
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:13.747 --> 00:15.916
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.985
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.920
VIVA THE REVOLUTION!

00:19.953 --> 00:23.191
[crowd cheering]

00:23.224 --> 00:25.426
[Taser crackling]
AGH!

00:25.459 --> 00:28.429
[triumphant fanfare]

00:28.462 --> 00:32.333
*

00:32.366 --> 00:34.702
WELCOME TO REVIEW.
I'M FORREST MACNEIL.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.004
WITH ME AS ALWAYS IS A.J. GIBBS.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.272
HI, A.J.
- HI, FORREST.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.273
- OKAY, WHAT'S MY NEXT REVIEW?

00:39.307 --> 00:40.874
- OKAY.
[tablet whirs]

00:40.908 --> 00:43.744
THIS COMES FROM CLARK
AT TOPCO INDUSTRIES.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.447
- I'VE WORKED AT MY JOB FOR NINE
YEARS, BUT I HATE MY NEW BOSS.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.183
I JUST WANT TO QUIT
IN HIS BIG, FAT, STUPID FACE.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.619
WHAT WOULD THAT FEEL LIKE?

00:51.652 --> 00:55.423
ALSO, BLUR THIS
IF YOU USE MY QUESTION.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.091
- AHA.
CLARK, YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:57.125 --> 00:59.727
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO QUIT A JOB
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY,

00:59.760 --> 01:03.164
AND THAT IS JUST WHAT I WILL DO.
HERE I GO.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.367
I BEGAN MY EXPERIENCE
BY WRITING THE MOST EPIC

01:06.400 --> 01:08.836
TAKE-THIS-JOB-AND-SHOVE-IT
SPEECH I COULD IMAGINE.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.371
THIS IS SO HARD.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.674
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A BOSS
THAT YOU HATE, YOU KNOW?

01:13.707 --> 01:16.477
- YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR,

01:16.510 --> 01:19.147
YOU NICKEL-AND-DIME
CHICKEN[bleep],

01:19.147 --> 01:22.015
AND I HOPE THIS PLACE BURNS
TO THE GROUND WITH YOU IN IT.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.451
- [whispering]
THAT'S GREAT.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.219
[normal voice]
I WAS NOW READY TO DELIVER

01:25.253 --> 01:27.388
MY BITTER FAREWELL.
[clears throat]

01:27.421 --> 01:29.290
- YOU REALIZE THAT IF YOU QUIT
YOUR JOB AT REVIEW,

01:29.323 --> 01:30.858
THAT MEANS YOU'LL NO LONGER
BE ABLE TO ISSUE

01:30.891 --> 01:32.993
A REVIEW
FOR QUITTING YOUR JOB.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.964
- RIGHT.
GRANT WAS RIGHT.

01:36.997 --> 01:39.500
WITH A BIT OF HELP
FROM OUR H.R. DEPARTMENT,

01:39.533 --> 01:42.035
I WENT TO A LOCAL BUSINESS
AND TOOK A CUSTOMER-SERVICE JOB

01:42.069 --> 01:45.873
IN ORDER TO QUIT IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.309
- HEY, FORREST.
[chuckles]

01:48.342 --> 01:52.480
JUST A LITTLE GIFT
TO SAY WELCOME ABOARD.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.415
HOW'S YOUR FIRST DAY GOING?

01:54.448 --> 01:58.051
- YOU KNOW, RON,
WHEN I STARTED HERE,

01:58.085 --> 02:00.888
I BELIEVED
IN WHAT WE WERE DOING.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.791
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

02:03.824 --> 02:07.295
BUT THERE IS ONE THING I KNOW.

02:07.328 --> 02:11.965
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR,

02:11.999 --> 02:16.437
AND I HOPE THIS PLACE BURNS
TO THE GROUND WITH YOU IN IT

02:16.470 --> 02:18.572
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE,

02:18.606 --> 02:24.578
YOU NICKEL-AND-DIME
CHICKEN[bleep] MOTHER[bleep]!

02:24.612 --> 02:27.481
YOU CALL YOURSELF A MANAGER?

02:27.515 --> 02:30.751
YOU COULDN'T MANAGE
A HAM SANDWICH!

02:30.784 --> 02:32.920
[object clatters]

02:32.953 --> 02:36.757
I AM WALKING OUT THAT DOOR...

02:36.790 --> 02:39.227
AND I WON'T COME BACK,

02:39.227 --> 02:43.231
NOT EVEN IF YOU BEG ME.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.799
WHO'S WITH ME?

02:53.874 --> 02:58.246
WELL, I HAD A JOB, AND I QUIT IT
WITH A FANTASTIC SPEECH,

02:58.246 --> 03:01.048
BUT SOMETHING WASN'T TAKING HOLD
FOR THIS REVIEW.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.716
IT WASN'T MY REAL JOB.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.385
AT NO POINT DID
I EVEN UNDERSTAND

03:04.418 --> 03:06.287
WHAT WORK WAS EXPECTED OF ME.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.389
SO I TOOK THE NEXT JOB
I FOUND--

03:08.422 --> 03:11.259
SERVING COFFEE IN THE LOBBY
OF AN OFFICE BUILDING,

03:11.259 --> 03:15.796
THE KIND OF JOB ANYONE COULD
MASTER AND DESPISE IN NO TIME.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.365
MORNING.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.100
MY BOSS WAS AN INCREDIBLY
OLD MAN NAMED WILLY,

03:20.133 --> 03:23.271
WITH A STRUGGLING BUSINESS
AND A LONG LIST OF INFIRMITIES.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.273
- I WASN'T REALLY LOOKING
TO HIRE SOMEONE.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.075
NOT EVEN SURE
I COULD AFFORD TO, HONESTLY.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.877
I JUST CAN'T TAKE STANDING
ALL DAY.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.713
- AND MY CO-WORKER WAS WENDELL,
WHO WAS DEDICATED,

03:32.746 --> 03:36.083
METICULOUSLY ORGANIZED,
AND, INCIDENTALLY, AUTISTIC.

03:36.116 --> 03:39.287
HE LIKES TO MAKE SURE THE SPOONS
ARE ALL FACING THE SAME WAY.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.589
- OH, YEAH, HE'S GOOD
ON INVENTORY.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.958
- YEAH.
- THERE'S 47 NAPKINS, 58 CUPS.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.728
THERE WERE 59, BUT PAM
FROM THE THIRD FLOOR HAD DECAF.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.564
- WORKING ALONGSIDE WILLY
AND WENDELL BEGAN TO MAKE ME

03:50.598 --> 03:53.301
FEEL LIKE I WAS PART
OF A FAMILY AGAIN.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.835
THEY INSPIRED ME
TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS

03:54.868 --> 03:56.637
AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT COULD BE.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.306
YOU KNOW, WILLY, THERE'S
NO REASON THIS COULDN'T BE

03:58.306 --> 04:00.474
A LOT MORE PROFITABLE.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.975
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.745
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.415
OPEN YOUR EYES!

04:07.448 --> 04:09.383
WELCOME TO LOBBY JAVA.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.152
I HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY
OF BRINGING WILLY'S COFFEE CART

04:12.185 --> 04:13.554
INTO THE MODERN AGE,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.723
COMPLETE WITH FAIR-TRADE,
ORGANIC COFFEE

04:15.756 --> 04:17.190
AND GOURMET PASTRIES,

04:17.224 --> 04:19.226
AS WELL AS THE EXORBITANT
PRICE MARKUPS

04:19.327 --> 04:20.861
THAT GO ALONG WITH THEM.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.996
WENDELL, YOU SEEM OVERWHELMED.
- IT'S FINE.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.598
- BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED
YOU TO FOCUS ON RIGHT NOW.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.534
I NEED TO KNOW HOW MANY PASTRIES
ARE IN THIS CASE.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.436
CAN YOU DO THAT FOR ME?
- SURE.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.340
- IN NO TIME AT ALL, WILLY'S WAS
TRANSFORMED INTO A SENSATION.

04:32.373 --> 04:35.709
THE BUZZ SPREAD QUICKER
THAN THE SMILE ACROSS MY FACE

04:35.743 --> 04:37.511
WHEN I ARRIVED TO WORK
EACH MORNING.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.746
HOW MANY CAPPUCCINOS
CAN I GET FOR YOU?

04:38.779 --> 04:40.748
- JUST THE ONE, PLEASE.
- [laughs] OKAY.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.450
$3.50.
THANK YOU.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.686
THERE WERE NO TWO WAYS
ABOUT IT--I LOVED MY JOB,

04:45.719 --> 04:47.421
TO THE POINT
WHERE I BEGAN TO FORGET

04:47.455 --> 04:49.357
THAT IT WASN'T MY REAL JOB.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.460
[knocks on counter]
- EXCUSE ME.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.429
- OH, WE'RE NOT OPEN YET, SIR--
OH, GRANT.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.464
HI.
- HEY.

04:56.497 --> 04:57.765
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND TO TALK?

04:57.798 --> 04:58.966
- UH...
- JUST FOR A SEC?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.368
- YES.
- YEAH.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.102
- HOW'S THE SHOW GOING?
- WELL...

05:02.135 --> 05:03.871
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.773
'CAUSE WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU
TO QUIT THIS JOB.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.775
- OH, YEAH.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.510
QUIT THIS JOB?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.178
- THAT'S WHY YOU TOOK THIS JOB
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.146
- I WAS THINKING OF--
MAYBE I WOULD CUT DOWN MY HOURS

05:13.180 --> 05:14.515
ONCE I GET THINGS UP TO SPEED,

05:14.548 --> 05:15.883
'CAUSE I HAVE
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT--

05:15.916 --> 05:17.284
- WELL,
YOU'RE REVIEWING QUITTING.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.852
VIEWERS NEED THIS.
- YEAH.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.722
- AMERICA NEEDS THIS,
AND THE WORLD NEEDS THIS.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.657
- SIX MINUTES UNTIL THE PASTRIES
ARRIVE, MR. FORREST.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.393
- DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
OR WHAT?

05:25.393 --> 05:27.395
- [sighs]

05:27.395 --> 05:31.164
- FORREST, GET OUT HERE.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

05:32.600 --> 05:37.905
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
"LOBBY JAVA BY FORREST."

05:37.938 --> 05:40.408
- UH, WILLY...

05:42.075 --> 05:46.414
I'M REALLY SORRY. UH...
[clears throat]

05:46.414 --> 05:49.082
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST STARTED HERE,

05:49.116 --> 05:52.986
I BELIEVED IN WHAT
WE WERE DOING.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.556
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.157
- WHAT?

05:57.190 --> 06:01.462
- BUT THERE IS, UH,
ONE THING I KNOW.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.632
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.233
- FORREST...
- AND I HOPE THIS PLACE--

06:06.266 --> 06:08.436
UGH--

06:08.469 --> 06:11.605
BURNS TO THE GROUND
WITH YOU IN IT,

06:11.639 --> 06:16.477
BECAUSE THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE,

06:16.510 --> 06:21.849
YOU NICKEL-AND-DIME
CHICKEN[bleep] MOTHER[bleep].

06:21.882 --> 06:25.018
OH, BOY.

06:25.052 --> 06:28.456
YOU CALL YOURSELF A MANAGER?

06:28.489 --> 06:32.460
YOU COULDN'T MANAGE
A HAM SANDWICH!

06:32.460 --> 06:36.029
[clears throat]
OKAY, I AM LEAVING HERE,

06:36.063 --> 06:39.600
AND I AM NEVER COMING BACK,

06:39.633 --> 06:42.870
NOT IF YOU BEG ME!

06:42.903 --> 06:45.138
WHO'S WITH ME?

06:47.007 --> 06:50.711
- I AM!
- OH.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.013
- IF MR. FORREST GOES, I GO!

06:53.046 --> 06:54.715
- OH, GOD.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.820
- YOU COULDN'T MANAGE
A HAM SANDWICH!

07:03.824 --> 07:07.761
[screams]

07:07.795 --> 07:10.130
- SINCE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME
AT OUR JOBS,

07:10.163 --> 07:12.500
OUR CO-WORKERS CAN BECOME
LIKE A SECOND FAMILY,

07:12.500 --> 07:15.235
AND OUR WORKPLACE
LIKE A SECOND HOME.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.804
AS EXHILARATING
A RUSH AS IT IS

07:16.837 --> 07:18.105
TO TELL OFF
AN AUTHORITY FIGURE,

07:18.138 --> 07:19.807
WHEN YOU QUIT YOUR JOB,

07:19.840 --> 07:22.510
YOU'RE LEAVING BEHIND MUCH MORE
THAN JUST A PAYCHECK.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.913
QUITTING YOUR JOB--
TWO STARS.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.953
[triumphant fanfare]

07:32.986 --> 07:35.523
- ALL RIGHT, A.J., WHAT LIFE
EXPERIENCE SHALL I REVIEW NEXT?

07:35.523 --> 07:36.890
- OKAY.
[tablet whirs]

07:36.924 --> 07:40.060
AN EMAIL FROM GLORIA
IN NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.095
SHE SAYS...

07:46.667 --> 07:48.135
- WOW.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.538
THAT'S A GREAT ONE
AND A PROFOUND ONE.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.573
- I KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO
IF IT WAS MY LAST DAY ON EARTH.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.775
- YEAH?
- I WOULD ADOPT A BABY.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.546
- YEAH, WELL, YOU--

07:58.546 --> 08:00.147
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GIVE THAT
A LITTLE MORE THOUGHT.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.082
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO AT ALL

08:02.115 --> 08:03.383
ON MY LAST DAY.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.619
I GUESS I'M GOING
TO FIND OUT.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.555
TO LIVE THIS DAY
AS IF IT WERE MY LAST

08:07.588 --> 08:10.057
REQUIRED A SENSE
OF RECKLESS ABANDON.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.124
[tattoo needle buzzing]
OH, [bleep]!

08:11.158 --> 08:13.827
OH, MOTHER[bleep]!
OH, GOD!

08:13.861 --> 08:15.963
I DECIDED TO HAVE "CARPE DIEM,"

08:15.996 --> 08:18.999
LATIN FOR "SEIZE THE DAY,"
TATTOOED ON MY BODY.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.102
[bleep] THIS!
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.236
- WELL, I STILL GOT
TO CHARGE YOU

08:23.270 --> 08:24.672
FOR THE LETTERS I PUT ON YOU.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.074
- I WOULD NOT GET
THE FULL CARPE DIEM,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.241
BUT I WOULD GET...

08:28.275 --> 08:30.343
CA.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.580
CA, YEAH.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.747
CA!
[laughs]

08:33.781 --> 08:37.017
I'M REALLY LIVING!
[laughs]

08:37.050 --> 08:41.021
HEY, BRING US
SOME MORE NACHOS, OKAY?

08:41.054 --> 08:43.824
WITH EXTRA CHEESE.
OH, HELL, IT'S MY LAST DAY.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.959
JUST BRING US A BOWL OF CHEESE!

08:45.993 --> 08:47.260
[laughter]

08:47.294 --> 08:48.829
- HEY, LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.964
IF THIS WERE
YOUR LAST DAY ON EARTH,

08:50.998 --> 08:53.266
I MEAN, IF THERE WERE
NO REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND TODAY,

08:53.300 --> 08:56.704
YOU COULD JUST GO FOR IT,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

08:56.737 --> 09:00.273
- WELL, I-I-I GUESS I--
- NO, NO, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:00.307 --> 09:03.010
DON'T TELL ME.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.613
JUST DO IT.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.815
- OKAY.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.054
EXCUSE ME.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.522
DOES ANYBODY WANT TO LEAVE,

09:15.623 --> 09:18.792
GO BACK TO MY PLACE,
AND [bleep] RIGHT NOW?

09:25.633 --> 09:27.067
- NO.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.468
WHERE ARE YOU--
- OH, MY GOD!

09:28.501 --> 09:30.771
- THAT IS FANTASTIC!
THAT'S THE THING

09:30.804 --> 09:32.806
TO DO ON YOUR LAST DAY.
[laughs]

09:32.840 --> 09:35.643
WELL DONE.
[laughs]

09:35.643 --> 09:37.377
OH--OH, NO. OH, NO.
[laughing]

09:37.410 --> 09:39.412
- HEY, EVERYBODY!

09:41.414 --> 09:44.051
- WHO--WHO WANTS TO GO [bleep]
ME AND MR. MACNEIL RIGHT NOW?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.386
[both laughing]

09:46.419 --> 09:48.822
- YES!
[laughs]

09:52.860 --> 09:56.129
[screaming]

09:56.163 --> 09:57.731
OH!

09:57.765 --> 09:58.832
UNDETERRED
BY THE LACK OF WOMEN

09:58.866 --> 10:00.801
INTERESTED IN HAVING SEX
WITH US,

10:00.834 --> 10:04.437
JOSH AND I ENJOYED A MORE
DEPENDABLE FORM OF MACHISMO.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.973
- COME ON, SHOOT IT!
- BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE,

10:06.006 --> 10:08.141
YOU MESSED WITH THE WRONG MAN!

10:08.175 --> 10:09.176
- [laughs]
- COME ON!

10:09.209 --> 10:10.944
[gunshot]
OH, COME ON.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.746
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH MY--THE WAY I'M STANDING?

10:12.780 --> 10:13.814
WHAT'S GOING ON?
- YOU'RE JUST NOT HITTING IT.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.115
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.684
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!
- YEAH!

10:16.717 --> 10:18.085
- COME ON!
- [laughs]

10:18.118 --> 10:21.188
- COME ON!
- COME ON!

10:21.221 --> 10:24.692
- OH, YOU PISSED OFF
THE WRONG GUY!

10:26.794 --> 10:28.962
[bleep]!
CA!

10:28.996 --> 10:30.998
- CA!

10:38.571 --> 10:40.841
- OH!
[laughs]

10:40.874 --> 10:42.642
- OH, COOL.
- THAT WENT A LONG WAY.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.711
- THAT WAS GOOD.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.445
- TO LIFE.
MMM.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.480
- TO LIFE.

10:47.514 --> 10:50.117
- THERE IS SO MUCH I WILL MISS.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.085
NOW LET'S GO GET SOME WHORES.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.090
[laughter]
- AH!

10:57.124 --> 10:59.459
WHILE RELAPSING ON COCAINE
WITH PROSTITUTES

10:59.492 --> 11:01.729
IS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS
A MAN CAN EVER DO,

11:01.762 --> 11:05.065
REGRETTABLY ON MY LAST DAY, IT
SEEMED LIKE A REASONABLE CHOICE.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.867
[siren wailing]
OH, [bleep].

11:06.900 --> 11:08.168
- COPS.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.536
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!
- OH, OH, OH.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.804
[screaming]
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

11:10.838 --> 11:11.972
[screaming]
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

11:12.005 --> 11:13.240
- NOBODY MOVE!

11:13.273 --> 11:15.008
COME HERE! COME HERE!
COME HERE!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.910
- NO, NO, NO.
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

11:16.944 --> 11:18.378
- GET DOWN!
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

11:18.411 --> 11:20.347
- JOSH!
[all yelling]

11:20.380 --> 11:22.049
- RUN, MR. MACNEIL,
IT'S YOUR LAST DAY!

11:22.082 --> 11:23.583
- COME HERE!

11:23.616 --> 11:25.318
- YOU'VE BEEN
A WONDERFUL UNPAID EMPLOYEE!

11:25.352 --> 11:27.354
- THANK YOU!
I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU,

11:27.387 --> 11:29.489
ABOUT MYSELF
AND ABOUT THE BUSINESS!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.258
UGH! OW!

11:31.291 --> 11:33.761
- THE SETBACKS AND CURVEBALLS
OF LIFE WERE NOTHING TO ME NOW.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.195
CA!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.930
THEY HAD NO POWER TO HURT ME

11:36.964 --> 11:38.932
BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEAR
WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ME NEXT.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.533
[siren wailing]

11:40.567 --> 11:43.603
BUT AS DUSK DESCENDED UPON ME
FOR THE LAST TIME,

11:43.636 --> 11:45.939
I BEGAN TO FEEL
THE INCREDIBLE SADNESS

11:45.973 --> 11:48.842
OF LEAVING EVERYTHING
AND EVERYONE BEHIND.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.843
ALSO, THE COCAINE
WAS WEARING OFF.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.780
[sobbing]
WHY?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.782
[knocks at door]

11:58.485 --> 12:00.387
- OH, MY GOD,
WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.589
- MY CLOTHES
ARE AT A WHOREHOUSE.

12:02.622 --> 12:03.791
- UGH.
OKAY, FORREST.

12:03.824 --> 12:04.958
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.693
I'M HERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE
FOREVER.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.961
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:07.995 --> 12:10.798
- IT'S MY LAST DAY.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.365
SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU

12:12.399 --> 12:14.134
FOR EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME AND...

12:14.167 --> 12:16.870
TO REALLY LIVE THIS DAY
AS IF IT WERE MY LAST,

12:16.904 --> 12:19.973
I NEEDED THE PEOPLE AROUND ME
TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS TOO.

12:20.007 --> 12:22.810
- WAIT.
ARE--ARE YOU SICK?

12:22.843 --> 12:26.113
- BUT LYING SEEMED
OUT OF BOUNDS.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.516
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.184
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T THINK
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.053
THIS TOTALLY MAKES SENSE.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.622
ALICIA'S UNCLE HAD ONE,
AND SHE SAID

12:35.655 --> 12:37.690
IT PUSHED ON PART OF HIS BRAIN.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.627
IT MADE HIM ACT CRAZY.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.162
[sighs]

12:42.195 --> 12:44.531
THAT'S WHY YOU'VE BEEN SUCH
A LUNATIC.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.666
- COCAINE IS AMAZING!
[grunts]

12:46.699 --> 12:48.368
[retches, screams]

12:48.401 --> 12:49.903
OH, GOD, I'M GONNA DIE!

12:49.937 --> 12:51.204
ARR, ARR, ARR!

12:51.238 --> 12:54.307
STINKIEST OF POOPS
THAT I'VE HAD--

12:54.341 --> 12:56.109
MY CLOTHES
ARE AT A WHOREHOUSE.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.415
THE HUMAN BRAIN.
- [sighs]

13:02.449 --> 13:05.853
I AM SO SORRY.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.156
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO DO?

13:09.189 --> 13:11.624
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.063
THAT'S THE DAY
WE WERE MARRIED.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.131
- HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
- OH.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.267
AND THIS WAS--
HOW OLD WAS HE HERE?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.401
DO YOU REMEMBER?

13:21.434 --> 13:23.403
- 2 1/2, I THINK.
- 2 1/2?

13:23.436 --> 13:26.773
- WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD GAMES
OF BANANAGRAMS IN THIS FAMILY.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.309
LIVING THIS DAY AS IF IT WERE
MY LAST WAS INCREDIBLE.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.945
SUZANNE HAD TAKEN ME BACK.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.347
HAD TRUE LOVE PREVAILED,
OR WAS IT JUST

13:34.381 --> 13:36.884
HER MISTAKEN BELIEF
THAT I HAD A MEDICAL EXCUSE

13:36.884 --> 13:39.686
FOR MONTHS OF BIZARRE BEHAVIOR
AND WOULD SOON BE DEAD?

13:39.719 --> 13:43.256
WHATEVER IT WAS, AT LONG LAST
WE WERE HAPPY AGAIN.

13:43.290 --> 13:47.895
- CAN YOU DO ANYTHING,
OR DOES IT HURT TOO MUCH?

13:47.895 --> 13:51.698
- OH.
NO, I CAN DO STUFF.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.433
MM.
- MM.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.669
[both laughing, moaning]

13:58.571 --> 14:01.341
YOU KNOW, WE GET SO CAUGHT UP
IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY STRUGGLES

14:01.374 --> 14:05.578
THAT WE CAN BE BLIND
TO THE REAL TREASURES OF LIFE.

14:05.612 --> 14:10.517
LIVING EACH DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR
LAST JUST MAKES THAT IMPOSSIBLE.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.785
THAT WAS THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.454
FIVE STARS.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.128
- I CAN'T WAIT
FOR MY LAST DAY ON EARTH.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.729
- YEAH.
IT WAS FUN.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.264
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.240
- A.J., DO WE HAVE TIME
FOR ONE LAST REVIEW?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.375
- LET'S GO FOR IT.
- YES.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.045
- CLAP4KIM@YAHOO.COM ASKS...

14:46.719 --> 14:48.421
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.690
WELL, SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IRISH.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.593
NOT SURE HOW I'M GONNA DO THAT.
I'M ONLY HALF IRISH.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.428
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S
ABOUT TO GET HAMMERED AGAIN.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.197
[laughs]
- UH, WELL, NOW, A.J.,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.132
I THINK AN IRISH PERSON
WOULD BE VERY OFFENDED BY THAT,

14:59.166 --> 15:00.467
BUT THEY WOULD ALSO ADMIT

15:00.500 --> 15:02.135
THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE.
HA HA.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.704
[Irish accent]
WELL, I'M OFF TO BECOME IRISH!

15:04.737 --> 15:06.873
HEY, HERLIHY, I TOLD YOU
ABOUT EATING THE GRASS.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.208
[sheep bleating]

15:08.241 --> 15:09.977
YOU SEE WHAT I DID
TO HIM OVER THERE?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.179
SHAUGHNESSY KICKED ME IN
THE FACE, AND I STOLE HIS PANTS,

15:12.212 --> 15:13.880
AND NOW HE LOOKS RIDICULOUS,
DOESN'T HE?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.548
ALL RIGHT.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.817
THANKS TO ME WIFE'S MISTAKEN
BELIEF THAT I WAS DYING

15:17.850 --> 15:19.987
OF BRAIN CANCER,
I WAS NOW BACK IN ME HOME.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.989
- FORREST, WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.823
- OH, I'M MAKING
A SWEATER, LOVE.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.658
WOULD YOU EVER BRING ME
MY KNITTING NEEDLES?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.995
- OH, UM, I WILL
IN JUST ONE SECOND.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.497
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T WE PUT
DOWN THE SHEARS,

15:30.530 --> 15:32.199
AND YOU HAVE
A LITTLE LIE-DOWN.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.666
- WELL, I HAVE WORKED
AWFULLY HARD.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.068
- YEAH, AND I'LL MAKE YOU
SOME OF THAT

15:35.102 --> 15:36.336
O'NEILL'S BLOOD PUDDING

15:36.369 --> 15:37.737
THAT YOU BOUGHT
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.706
- OH, LISTEN, MCGINTY
IS A HOUSE SHEEP.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.174
I HOPE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT
WITH THAT.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.875
- IS HE?
OKAY.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.677
- I FELT SINCERELY GUILTY
ABOUT RETURNING TO ME FAMILY

15:44.711 --> 15:47.180
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,
BUT WE WERE ALL ENJOYING

15:47.214 --> 15:49.349
THE LUCK OF THE IRISH
TOO MUCH TO LET THE TRUTH

15:49.382 --> 15:50.583
STAND IN THE WAY.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.219
HEY, PUT THAT FORK DOWN,
YOUNG FELLA.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.521
WE HAVEN'T SAID GRACE YET.
- OH.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.856
- IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER AND
THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.191
- WHAT?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.359
- YOUR FATHER'S
SAYING GRACE, ERIC.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.693
GET WITH IT, COME ON.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.062
- PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER,
YOUNG MAN.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.663
DEAR LORD IN HEAVEN,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.265
WE THANK YE HUMBLY

16:05.298 --> 16:07.467
FOR THIS BREAD
THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE,

16:07.500 --> 16:10.603
AND WE THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR MAKING US IRISH.

16:10.637 --> 16:14.741
PLEASE NEVER STRIKE US BLIND
OR GIVE US CONSUMPTION.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.043
- IS THIS PART
OF THE BRAIN TUMOR?

16:16.043 --> 16:17.844
- YES, IT IS.
- OH.

16:17.877 --> 16:18.845
- THANK YOU, LORD.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.181
AMEN.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.250

16:23.283 --> 16:25.585

SOME BLOOD SAUSAGE?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.754
[Irish folk music]

16:27.787 --> 16:29.522
WHOO-HOO!

16:29.556 --> 16:33.293
* OH, HE TWISTED HIS WHISKERS
AND SAID WITH A GRIN *

16:33.326 --> 16:35.962
* DON'T MAKE ME MAD,
I'LL LET MYSELF IN *

16:36.063 --> 16:40.367
* AND I SAID TO THE MOUSE
[clapping]

16:40.400 --> 16:44.137
all: STAY OUT OF MY HOUSE!
[laughter]

16:44.171 --> 16:46.339
- I WAS HAVING A MARVELOUS TIME
LIVING LIFE AS AN IRISHMAN

16:46.373 --> 16:47.774
WITH ME FAMILY AT HOME

16:47.807 --> 16:50.210
AND WITH ME NEW IRISH FAMILY
DOWN AT THE PUB.

16:50.243 --> 16:52.445
IT WAS THE KIND OF DAY
THAT MAKES A MAN FEEL

16:52.479 --> 16:54.081
THAT NOTHING
COULD EVER GO WRONG.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.815
YEAH!
AH!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.117
[laughs]
THAT'S GREAT.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.651
I MIGHT DO A LITTLE BIT
OF A JIG--

16:58.685 --> 17:00.887
OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE,
ME WILD IRISH ROSE.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.722
- I SPOKE TO YOUR DOCTOR.
- AH.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.524
- YOU DON'T HAVE A BRAIN TUMOR.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.294
- UM, WELL...

17:07.327 --> 17:10.297
WE IRISH ARE KNOWN
FOR OUR BLARNEY, ARE WE NOT?

17:10.330 --> 17:12.532
[laughs]
- YOUR SON THINKS YOU'RE DYING.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.101
- UH...

17:14.101 --> 17:16.236
- THIS--THIS IS FOR THE SHOW,
ISN'T IT?

17:16.269 --> 17:19.372
IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
- UM...

17:19.406 --> 17:22.109
UM, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T TELL YOU, RIGHT?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.910
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S
FOR THE SHOW. I'M NOT ALLOWED--

17:23.943 --> 17:25.245
- OKAY, I NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH
OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING

17:25.278 --> 17:26.713
IS FOR THE SHOW.
- I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.248
- DID YOU GET ADDICTED
TO COCAINE FOR THE SHOW?

17:28.281 --> 17:29.882
- [sighs]
SWEETHEART--

17:29.916 --> 17:33.653
- DID YOU GET MY DAD KILLED
IN SPACE FOR THE SHOW?

17:33.686 --> 17:36.956
OH, MY GOD.
DID YOU DIVORCE ME FOR THE SHOW?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.732
- EVERYTHING I DO,
I DO FOR IRELAND!

17:45.765 --> 17:47.667
all:
IRELAND!

17:47.700 --> 17:51.003
- OKAY, LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU GET PASSIONATE ABOUT THINGS,

17:51.037 --> 17:53.673
AND YOU LOSE YOURSELF IN THEM.
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU, OKAY?

17:53.706 --> 17:55.975
BUT IF THERE'S ANY WAY WE ARE
EVER GOING TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN,

17:56.008 --> 17:58.278
YOU NEED TO PUT LIMITS
ON WHAT YOU DO FOR THE SHOW.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.447
OUR FAMILY HAS TO COME
FIRST, FORREST.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.215
- DARLING, THE FAMILY ALWAYS
COMES FIRST.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.383
DON'T EVEN DOUBT IT--
- OKAY, WOULD YOU JUST STOP?

18:03.416 --> 18:06.052
STOP DOING THE VOICE.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.254
- 'TIS TRUE,
ME BROGUE IS THICK...

18:07.287 --> 18:09.222
- STOP IT.
- BUT I MEAN WHAT I SAY.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.592
- I NEED YOU
TO STOP THE VOICE.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.433
- UM, IT'S A BIT
OF A PUZZLER.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.868
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA STOP.
ALL RIGHT.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.770
- NO, I MEAN, I--
- OKAY, THIS IS DONE.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.872
- I CAN'T STOP IT--SWEETHEART.
- THIS IS DONE. I'M SORRY.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.374
- I JUST--I CAN'T DO THIS
ANYMORE, OKAY?

18:27.407 --> 18:28.741
WE'RE DONE.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.277
AND, YEAH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.445
THIS MAN IS FROM WISCONSIN!

18:32.479 --> 18:34.547

DON'T--NOW, LOVE--

18:34.581 --> 18:36.183
LOVE, LOVE, COME ON.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.085
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- NO, FORREST, STOP!

18:39.186 --> 18:41.921
- SWEETHEART, DON'T--
AH.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.923
HMM.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.060
- MM.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.596
THAT WAS GREAT.
WE GOT IT.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.364
TERRIFIC.

18:51.398 --> 18:53.300
DO YOU WANT TO WRAP, OR DO
YOU WANT TO PUNCH ANYBODY OUT?

18:53.333 --> 18:55.368
THAT'S PRETTY IRISH.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.471
- DID YOU SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED
WITH MY WIFE?

18:58.505 --> 19:02.074
- YOUR EX-WIFE IS A NUT JOB.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.044
- WHAT?

19:05.077 --> 19:08.047
- LOOK, THE IRISH SUFFER.
IT'S IN THEIR BLOOD, OKAY?

19:08.080 --> 19:11.218
IT'S TRADITION.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.885
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
- HMM?

19:12.919 --> 19:14.387
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
ABOUT THE GUY

19:14.421 --> 19:15.988
WHO WAITED AND WAITED
AND WAITED AND WAITED

19:16.022 --> 19:18.825
UNTIL A LITTLE BIT OF FUNGUS
TURNED INTO PENICILLIN.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.827
- MM.
- AND THIS IRISH SEQUENCE

19:20.860 --> 19:24.497
IS VERY CLOSE
TO BECOMING PENICILLIN...

19:24.531 --> 19:27.534
THANKS TO YOU.
- IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

19:27.567 --> 19:30.002
- WELL, THOSE WERE YOUR WORDS,
AND I THINK THEY SAY A LOT.

19:36.443 --> 19:40.980
- YOU KNOW, GRANT,
WHEN I STARTED HERE,

19:41.013 --> 19:43.750
I BELIEVED IN WHAT
WE WERE DOING,

19:43.783 --> 19:46.018
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.255
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
I DO KNOW.

19:48.255 --> 19:51.258
YOU'RE THE BIGGEST JAG-OFF
I'VE EVER WORKED FOR,

19:51.258 --> 19:54.261
AND I HOPE THIS PLACE BURNS
TO THE GROUND WITH YOU IN IT,

19:54.261 --> 19:56.263
'CAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DESERVE,

19:56.263 --> 19:59.666
YOU NICKEL-AND-DIME
CHICKEN[bleep] MOTHER[bleep]!

19:59.699 --> 20:02.335
[normal voice]
YOU CALL YOURSELF A PRODUCER?

20:02.369 --> 20:04.871
YOU COULDN'T PRODUCE
A HAM SANDWICH!

20:04.904 --> 20:06.273
NOW I AM WALKING OUT
THAT DOOR,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.040
AND I AM NEVER COMING BACK,

20:08.074 --> 20:09.909
NOT IF YOU BEG ME!
I QUIT!

20:09.942 --> 20:11.911
[all cheering]
- YEAH!

20:11.944 --> 20:13.880
- AND ONE MORE THING!

20:15.147 --> 20:18.618
all: OH!
[cheering]

20:18.651 --> 20:20.387
- CATCH HIM.
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY!

20:20.420 --> 20:21.721
FORREST!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.756
DON'T LET HIM GET AWAY.
DO YOU HAVE HIM?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.529
- SUZANNE!

20:29.562 --> 20:32.299
SUZANNE!

20:32.332 --> 20:34.967
SUZANNE!

20:35.001 --> 20:39.539
- OKAY, WEIRDLY ENOUGH, FORREST
HAS ACTUALLY NOT BEEN SEEN

20:39.572 --> 20:42.609
BY ANYONE HERE AT THE SHOW
SINCE THAT NIGHT,

20:42.642 --> 20:45.978
SO IT SEEMS LIKE
HE REALLY DID QUIT FOR REAL,

20:46.012 --> 20:49.549
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY
VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.552
BEING IRISH, HOWEVER,
SEEMED LIKE A TON OF FUN,

20:52.585 --> 20:56.856
SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GIVE
THAT THE OLD FIVE STARS.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.361
THAT'S ALL THE TIME
THAT WE HAVE FOR TONIGHT.

21:01.394 --> 21:05.765
I'M A.J. GIBBS, AMERICA,
AND YOUR LIFE IS MY LIFE.
