WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.280
Let's fucking do this.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.400
Come on.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.800
More pulling.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.280
More getting mortal.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.040
More fights.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.280
What are you fucking on about?

00:27.480 --> 00:29.760
Things are about to go crazy.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.600
Let the chaos begin.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
Why?

00:41.120 --> 00:43.600
It's fucking time Holly
knew the truth.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.600
Tell me fucking what?

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
Bullshit.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.200
Don't you fucking lie!

00:57.280 --> 00:58.560
I need to get out.

01:00.600 --> 01:05.400
He's not tried to explain himself.
I'm obviously not worth fighting for.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.440
(cries hysterically)

01:09.720 --> 01:11.760
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.040
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.000
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.960
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.200
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.360
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.080
I'm preened to perfection.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.160
I'm colourful
and full of mischief.

01:27.240 --> 01:29.160
I'm fake, flirty and got double Fs.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.680
I'm gonna get everyone feisty.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.160
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:50.800 --> 01:54.480
Last night was the worst night
of my entire life.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.760
I've lost the lad who I potentially
saw some kind of future with

01:58.840 --> 02:02.840
and I've lost the girl who's been
there for me through everything.

02:02.920 --> 02:06.040
And I don't know
how I'm gonna get through this.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.400
What the fuck happened last night?

02:11.480 --> 02:15.720
Everyone was absolutely buzzing.
That turned quickly, didn't it?

02:15.800 --> 02:19.280
Last night was wicked until
we got back, then all of a sudden,

02:19.360 --> 02:20.720
World War fucking three.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.440
Last night, Kyle should have told
Holly exactly where she stands.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.520
Instead, he ran away. Dickhead.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.400
I've woke up this morning
and I'm just so scared

02:46.480 --> 02:49.280
because Holly's downstairs
and I'm upstairs

02:49.360 --> 02:53.360
and I really don't think she's ever
gonna forgive us for what happened.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.400
I'm angry at Charlotte.
I'm so angry.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.840
She knew that he'd said those things
behind my back

03:12.920 --> 03:16.800
and to find out like that
was just absolutely heartbreaking.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.520
What I did came from a good place.
I just wanted to make things better.

03:26.600 --> 03:30.080
I wanted to be a good friend.
I didn't mean to break her heart.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.400
(sighs)

03:32.480 --> 03:35.720
He is the one who ran away.
He walked off.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.200
I begged him, I screamed it.
I begged him.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
I can see that Holly's broken
and this is all because of Kyle.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.280
Kyle's left her. I don't know how
we're gonna get the old Holly back.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.760
I just need to know once and for all.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.640
Are we gonna
make a go of this or not?

03:58.720 --> 04:02.120
Because... I can't deal
with this any more.Yeah.

04:02.200 --> 04:07.440
Not once did I pressure Kyle into
doing something he wasn't ready for.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.720
But right now, I am that low that
I couldn't give a fuck what happens.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.040
I just need to know where I stand.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.200
I'm so sorry.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.880
I know that Kyle was the one
to walk out last night.

04:25.960 --> 04:29.440
But I need to know where I stand,
so I'm gonna ring him.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.520
Hiya.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.880
Er, yeah. Where are ya?

04:36.240 --> 04:38.560
OK, well, I think we need to talk.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.320
Kyle's saying that he wants to see me
alone away from the house.

04:47.400 --> 04:51.760
It would be a good idea to talk, but
I'm terrified of what he's gonna say.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.840
"See you in a little while."
Bye."Bye."

04:59.360 --> 05:03.920
(phone rings)

05:04.000 --> 05:06.200
Phone's going,
I know who it's gonna be.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.520
If she's thinking about sending us
to work, she can swivel.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.720
"Hi, Charlotte."
Hiya.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.600
"I've got a very special tash-o-gram
today."Oh, God, right, OK.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.080
Shock, it's work, and yes!
I'm not going.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.560
Do the work wave
when you're not at work.

05:29.640 --> 05:31.440
Booyakasha.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.920
So work today is a tash-o-gram

05:35.000 --> 05:41.440
in a call centre
for a lady's 40th birthday.No.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.400
I can see Gary
and Aaron's faces already

05:44.480 --> 05:48.080
and I've not even told them
that it's then going to work yet.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.760
In... your... face.

05:50.840 --> 05:56.000
I think she's picked the perfect two
people for the job. Gary and Aaron.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.880
(laughter)

05:57.960 --> 06:00.800
A 40th fucking birthday,
at a call centre.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.520
This is my worst nightmare.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.320
Oh, I am fucking dreading this.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.320
Charlotte is clearly loving this

06:07.400 --> 06:10.920
but what she doesn't realise is
giving a MILF a good time on her 40th

06:11.000 --> 06:12.640
is right up my street.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.120
It's a strip-o-gram!

06:16.200 --> 06:17.280
Nah.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.120
Anna hasn't done well at all.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.880
All I can see is a fucking leather
thong. Fucking pervy bitch.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.320
Go and try them on.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.560
We're dressed to impress.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.120
We'll grab the flowers, chocolates
and champagne and head out.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.240
Ooh! Sexy!

06:44.040 --> 06:46.880
Walking through reception
and down the corridor,

06:46.960 --> 06:49.760
I am so nervous.
Hands are starting to shake.

06:49.840 --> 06:51.760
I just want this to go smoothly.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.360
I'm sweating
and I've got not clothes on.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.120
Joanne!

07:00.200 --> 07:03.440
It's your birthday.
(laughter)

07:03.520 --> 07:05.360
We find Joanne and thank fuck.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.800
She looks just as embarrassed
as we are.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.040
Thank you.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.120
Joanne's made the call.
Time to get the pants off.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.800
But we're going commando.
This could go terribly wrong.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
You're pulling me hips in two.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.440
Fuck me. Joanne's keen. She's nearly
ripped me apron and me pants off!

07:25.520 --> 07:28.800
That's not part of the deal.
Keep your hands to yourself.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.200
Joanne wants to spank me
with a massive ruler.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.960
Why did I open me mouth?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.400
Joanne is one kinky MILF.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.200
She's tapping away at Aaron's arse
getting harder, but the last one,

07:46.280 --> 07:48.120
she is winding up like...

07:48.200 --> 07:49.880
Oh!

07:54.400 --> 07:58.520
Joanne's got a bit over-excited. She
hit us so hard the ruler snapped.

07:58.600 --> 08:01.120
Anna better be paying me double
for this!

08:01.200 --> 08:03.800
Happy birthday.Kiss.
Thank you. See you later.

08:03.880 --> 08:07.840
Job done. This is one birthday she
won't forget, neither will my arse.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.160
I'm about to go and meet Kyle

08:22.240 --> 08:25.640
and I've never been more nervous
for anything in my entire life.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.960
I feel as though
this is make or break.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.760
(both) Oh... my... God!

08:32.840 --> 08:36.720
Wow, that is gorgeous.
Wowzer.Do you think?

08:36.800 --> 08:40.160
You look like
you're going to the Oscars.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.360
Holly has literally
took me breath away.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.040
She looks unbelievably stunning.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.520
I'm so worried she's not gonna get
the answer she wants.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.920
If he's gonna break up with us I'm
gonna make... it very damn hard.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.320
I know.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.200
The things is it's like... prepare
for the worst and hope for the best.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.480
If Kyle says he wants to break up,

09:03.560 --> 09:06.360
the only think
I can think of to say is why?

09:06.440 --> 09:08.240
Why have we been fighting so much?

09:08.320 --> 09:11.600
Why the fuck have I put myself
through so much stress?

09:11.680 --> 09:13.480
I've been fighting for nothing.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.920
It's like make or break, innit?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.840
Are you nervous?Never been more
nervous of anything in me life.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.280
I feel so bad cos I feel helpless.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.840
There's nothing we can say to Holly.
It's out of our control.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.520
The ball is in Kyle's court.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.200
Oh, God. (sighs)

09:39.800 --> 09:43.800
She's practically shaking.
I am so scared for her.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.880
Every single hope is pinned
onto this one meeting with Kyle,

09:47.960 --> 09:50.240
I just hope it doesn't go wrong.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.120
I feel physically sick.

09:55.200 --> 09:58.000
My instinct is telling me
we're gonna finish.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.880
I don't know how
I'm gonna deal with it.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.840
I'm really nervous about tonight.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.960
I don't know how I'm gonna feel
when I see Holly.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.920
When I spoke to Kyle on the phone,
he didn't sound good,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.040
which isn't leading me
to be positive about this.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.440
I didn't expect things to go
this far between me and Holly.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.240
I didn't expect to have
to deal with her past.

10:35.800 --> 10:40.520
I've never ever felt like this before
I don't know what way it's gonna go.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.600
All I can feel is my heart beating
inside my chest. I'm just so scared.

10:44.680 --> 10:46.080
Hi.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.880
I walk in and I know
that I look amazing,

10:53.960 --> 10:58.160
and Kyle can't look me in the eye
and that's when I know... it's over.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.400
I didn't.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.680
OK.

11:04.760 --> 11:08.240
I've put Holly through enough.
She deserves to know how I feel.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.040
I'm gonna be honest.
Your past does bother us.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.720
You knew about my past before you
started getting involved with us.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.000
I know, but I didn't think
I'd get in this deep.

11:19.600 --> 11:24.480
It's my fault more than yours.
It's totally my fault. I'm sorry.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.760
I've been through this moment
a million times in me head

11:27.840 --> 11:31.040
but now I'm here I don't know
if I can do it.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.200
I'm gripped onto my chair.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.120
All I want him to do
is put me out of my fucking misery.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.120
Are you gonna finish with me?

11:47.800 --> 11:49.600
Just fucking say it!

11:56.480 --> 11:59.200
All I can think about is Holly.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.080
Fingers crossed.
I just want her to be happy.

12:03.800 --> 12:07.320
I'm always buzzing for a night out,
time to hit the toon.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.120
Tonight's gonna be unreal.
Everyone's gonna get fucking mortal.

12:15.800 --> 12:20.200
My plan is to get as pissed
as possible as soon as possible

12:20.280 --> 12:23.080
just in case it's bad news
for Holly and Kyle.

12:30.160 --> 12:34.200
None of us can concentrate. All we
are thinking about is Holly and Kyle

12:48.080 --> 12:49.520
(sighs)

12:50.560 --> 12:52.280
Just fucking say it!

12:52.360 --> 12:55.400
Something just feels really,
really different tonight.

12:55.480 --> 12:59.600
Kyle can't look at me. I feel sick.
My gut's telling me that it's over.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.400
I'm fucking terrified.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.000
Erm...

13:07.760 --> 13:11.600
I just think to meself,
fuck this house, fuck Anna,...

13:11.680 --> 13:14.920
...fuck my past and fuck your past.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.360
I want you as me girlfriend. I want
ya as me lass. What do you say?

13:21.440 --> 13:23.440
Yes.
(laughs)

13:23.520 --> 13:25.640
Oh, my God.

13:28.560 --> 13:33.680
(screams) I've got a boyfriend,
I've got a boyfriend.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.160
Go Holly, Go Holly.
You got a boyfriend, oh, yeah!

13:37.240 --> 13:40.880
Oh, God, I've never been so scared
in me entire life.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.960
For the first time in me life
I've got a girlfriend.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.400
This has been a big decision for me.

13:47.480 --> 13:52.320
I didn't know if I could deal with
Holly's past but I wanna be with her

13:52.400 --> 13:55.400
I genuinely thought
that you were gonna end it.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.480
I can't begin to describe how I feel.

13:57.560 --> 14:02.480
I can't wait to get to the club and
introduce everyone to my boyfriend.

14:09.280 --> 14:13.280
We're trying to have a good night,
but the atmosphere feels on edge.

14:13.360 --> 14:17.000
We're just worrying to see what's
gonna happen with Holly and Kyle.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.640
Now that me and Kyle are actually
boyfriend and girlfriend,

14:28.720 --> 14:32.640
we think we should play a game on
everybody and pretend he's ended it.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.920
Oh, no, no, no.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.840
Holly's just walked in and she looks
fucking devastated. Kyle's a prick.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.400
He's finished with her.
That's tonight ruined.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.560
What the fuck? Holly's in tears.

14:47.640 --> 14:51.960
Kyle is a dick for finishing with my
friend when she looks that good.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.440
Haha! Just kidding!

14:57.520 --> 14:59.880
You fucking dickhead.
Yes!

14:59.960 --> 15:01.360
You dick!
Yes!

15:01.440 --> 15:05.640
Kyle walks in smiling.
These two are having us on. Pricks.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.840
(screaming)

15:14.920 --> 15:18.280
I can't believe it.
Kyle and Holly are finally together.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.800
They're finally boyfriend
and girlfriend!

15:28.360 --> 15:29.360
(cheering)

15:33.120 --> 15:34.840
I'm pleased we're good,

15:34.920 --> 15:38.520
but there's one more person in
this relationship to make happy.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.560
Oh, God, Kyle's pulled us aside,
this could get awkward.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.400
It's the first time we've spoke
since our argument.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.880
Well, this is good!
Kyle's apologising,

15:59.960 --> 16:03.080
and then I'll apologise
and everything will be fine.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.640
So I was right. It was me
who got Holly and Kyle together.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.360
I am the reason they're so happy.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.320
This is the best night
in Geordie Shore, ever.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.680
I'm glad me and Charlotte are
friends, even without Holly,

16:36.760 --> 16:40.560
I'll always look out for her because
she's like me little sister.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.440
Yes, I do fancy Scott. What's your
problem? You probably do too.

17:14.360 --> 17:17.480
I love taking the piss out of Chloe.
I fucking love her.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.760
Here, Nathan, stop being so cheeky.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.240
When Scott comes back, he's mine.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.080
Love is in the air tonight. I've
been sucked in by Marnie again.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.680
It doesn't really matter
what Aaron tells us.

18:00.760 --> 18:03.160
I still end up kissing him anyway.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.320
I thought I got away with that.

18:15.560 --> 18:19.040
Marnie and Aaron are all over
each other. Get on with it!

18:19.120 --> 18:23.160
I'm sick of seeing them touch each
other's flesh. Just fucking shag!

18:55.720 --> 18:58.720
Gary's smashed. I've
never seen him this drunk before.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.640
He's saying all of his words wrong.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.520
Normally, Gary's quite intelligent.
But I'm the brainy one here.

19:14.600 --> 19:15.760
Winning!

19:20.040 --> 19:22.160
I don't know
what's got into us tonight.

19:22.240 --> 19:26.200
I am missing Scott and I wanna pull.
Marnie, you're looking fit tonight!

19:30.600 --> 19:33.560
Chloe's necking on with us.
I'm gonna go along with it.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.960
She's the only person
I haven't kissed.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.000
I've had a wicked night,
time to head home.

19:51.080 --> 19:55.040
But I'm not sure if I can get there
without a bit of extra attention.

19:55.120 --> 19:59.720
I'm far too scared to even look in
the back to see what they're doing.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.480
I really am.
Shit! Is that a fucking foot?

20:03.560 --> 20:06.320
We're on the way home.
But I just can't wait.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.840
A little bit of foreplay won't hurt,
will it?

20:08.920 --> 20:13.320
No, please, don't do that now.
It's not fair. I'm getting horny.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.280
Yous, not in the taxi!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.760
(screams)

20:21.840 --> 20:26.280
I don't know why they're so shocked.
We're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.920
Oh, my God. I'm gonna start crying.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.080
Oh, my fuck! Shit!

20:34.160 --> 20:37.080
Holly and Kyle are acting
like it's a porno.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.360
There's dicks
and fannies everywhere.

20:39.440 --> 20:43.440
It's the cock! I don't wanna look,
Chloe, cos I get nervous

20:43.520 --> 20:46.760
and then I'll start crying
and when I cry I can't stop.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.240
Shit, I'm jealous!

20:48.320 --> 20:50.120
Why are you saying keep going?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.920
I can hear sloppy noises
and moaning.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.120
Could they not wait
till we get back?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.800
This isn't real. This isn't real.

20:57.880 --> 21:00.120
This is not, definitely real.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.040
I've been scarred for life
in that taxi.

21:05.480 --> 21:09.840
I've just had the worst taxi ride
of my fucking life!

21:09.920 --> 21:13.120
Holly was sucking Kyle off.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.880
Nathan, welcome. Welcome
to the Geordie Shore house, mate.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.880
There is no time to waste.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.400
Me and Kyle will
christen this relationship.

21:26.480 --> 21:30.440
(moaning)

21:34.880 --> 21:36.680
Everyone is absolutely smashed.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.960
I can barely see,
but I know what I want.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.640
Oh, my God!

21:44.040 --> 21:48.000
Can't keep our hands off each other.
It's an Aaron and Marnie night.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.400
Everyone's snoozed-up to the max.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.240
Wakey-fucking-wakey
cos Turbo-dick's back!

22:21.200 --> 22:24.000
Oi-oi!(screaming)
Wakey, wakey!

22:24.080 --> 22:28.560
I was having the best dream ever
and then Scott's bouncing on me bed!

22:28.640 --> 22:30.400
What the fuck is going on?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.160
Oh, you fucking prick.

22:32.240 --> 22:34.800
Chloe, what the fuck is that?

22:34.880 --> 22:37.040
Why have you been gone for so long?

22:37.120 --> 22:41.680
Scott's back with a bang.
I wouldn't expect it any other way.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.800
Proper fight over Aaron.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.880
I've only been away
for a couple of weeks

22:51.960 --> 22:53.920
but it feels like
fucking five years.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.040
What have I missed?
Everything.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.480
It's about time
that Holly and Kyle got together.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.800
Kyle's a twat for making her
wait this long, but he got there.

23:12.240 --> 23:14.240
What's gaaning on here, like?

23:15.240 --> 23:19.080
So I've walked in the lads' bedroom,
and Marnie's in my bed with Aaron.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.160
Maybe she wanted to play with Aaron
while smelling me.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.160
What the fuck?!

23:27.240 --> 23:29.240
Hi.

23:29.320 --> 23:33.320
Fucking hell, Scott's back. The peace
and quiet was nice while it lasted.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.000
Fucking hell,
you're fresh this morning!

23:36.760 --> 23:38.560
I'm fucking buzzing to be back.

23:38.640 --> 23:43.240
I thought I might as well organise
a massive surprise for everyone.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.720
We've got a big day. I've organised
this event for everyone to do.

23:47.800 --> 23:51.200
It's an activity, and you're gonna
fucking love it.

23:51.280 --> 23:54.360
Scott's got a surprise for all.
I wonder what the fuck it is.

23:54.440 --> 23:59.240
I'm nervous. I am nervous.
You should be a little bit.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.480
Pack their shit,
wash their fannies

24:01.560 --> 24:03.760
cos Scotty-T has got
a massive surprise.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.680
And for once, it's not me chod.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.840
Scott's been back two minutes,
and he's got a surprise.

24:11.920 --> 24:13.440
Fuck knows what we're in for.

24:15.920 --> 24:18.960
God knows where we're going.
I'm holding out

24:19.040 --> 24:21.200
for some kind of take-away
drive-thru.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.640
Just fucking tell wuh.

24:24.880 --> 24:29.920
They're gonna be fucking buzzing
their dicks off when they find out.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.520
I thought, "Fuck it! Why don't
I book everyone a fucking skydive?"

24:35.600 --> 24:37.840
Cannot jump out of a plane.
I'm sorry.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.560
Who in their right mind wants
to fling themselves out of a plane?

24:45.600 --> 24:48.200
Before we go,
we need to do training.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.880
But how much training do you need?

24:50.960 --> 24:53.640
Before we start,
is anyone over 15 stone?

24:58.920 --> 25:01.360
Unfortunately,
you won't be able to jump.

25:01.440 --> 25:06.040
I can't fucking believe it.
I am too fat to fly.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.680
I could cry.
Aw.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.400
It looks like someone else
won't be doing the skydive

25:12.480 --> 25:14.680
because Nathan ate all the pies.

25:17.920 --> 25:21.840
I don't want ya to die!
We've only just got together.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.920
I'm absolutely terrified,
but I've got Kyle by my side,

25:26.000 --> 25:28.360
and if he can do it, I can do it.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.160
Once I'm up in that plane,
I could bottle it.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.800
Sometimes I wonder why I fancy
Aaron. He's a little pussy.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.920
The plane's going up.
It feels like I'm going on holiday.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.800
I've got a man strapped to my back
and I'm about to throw meself out

25:50.880 --> 25:52.400
at 10,000 fucking feet.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.560
Fuck man! What am I doing?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.720
Fucking hell.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.640
We've been waiting all day to do
this, I can't wait. I'm buzzing.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.640
Oh, my God!

26:09.720 --> 26:13.600
I'm the first to jump.
This shit just got real.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.840
Doors have opened,
Gary is at the edge.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.080
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!

26:18.160 --> 26:21.320
There's no turning back.
I fucking love this shit.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.880
This is better
than my first ever threesome!

26:30.880 --> 26:34.960
(gasps)
(screaming)

26:35.040 --> 26:37.000
(screams)

26:39.240 --> 26:42.280
This is fucking unbelievable!

26:42.360 --> 26:45.000
Why don't I do this every day?

26:49.840 --> 26:53.520
I'm crying with happiness.
It's like nothing I've felt before.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.160
Let's go!

26:56.280 --> 27:00.160
Is it a bird? Is it a plane?
Nah! It's Scotty fucking T.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.800
I can't describe this feeling.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.520
Feels like I've jumped out
of a plane from mid-air!

27:15.000 --> 27:18.720
It's amazing! Possibly the best
feeling I've ever had in me life.

27:20.160 --> 27:24.080
I'm really glad that my arse
is fucking colossal,

27:24.160 --> 27:26.280
because it's gonna break my fall.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.320
What a first day in a relationship!

27:28.400 --> 27:30.960
I jumped out of a plane
with me girlfriend!

27:33.200 --> 27:36.480
Even though it's one of the
scariest things I've ever done,

27:36.560 --> 27:38.240
Scott's idea was wicked.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.320
I'm so glad that I organised this
for everyone.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.800
I've missed my Geordie Shore family
and what better way to show them?

27:48.280 --> 27:52.880
Even though me and Nathan didn't do
it, I still enjoyed watching yous.

27:52.960 --> 27:55.920
I'm proud of yous all for jumping.
Very proud of you.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.520
Today's been amazing and everyone
could not be in a better mood.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.080
We need to get home,
get ready and get to town.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.920
We are all raring to hit the town for
the last time, and it's gonna go off.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.440
Last night's family night
and there's certain rules.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.120
You're not allowed to pull.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.040
Unless, in the family.

28:20.240 --> 28:23.920
If Scott give me the option tonight,
I might give him a chance.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.640
So do you like him, Chloe?
Like who? Scott. A bit.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.880
Do you think you're gonna go out
with a bang then?Maybe.

28:31.960 --> 28:35.400
I think you might.
I think there's a good possibility.

28:37.720 --> 28:39.680
The girls have finished me make-up.

28:39.760 --> 28:43.560
They've done a canny good job.
Chloe, you look amazing.

28:43.640 --> 28:47.680
Scott won't be able to keep
his mitts off me tits tonight.

28:49.120 --> 28:53.800
Everyone, cheers! The last fucking
night!Come on!(cheering)

29:01.000 --> 29:05.600
Buzzing for our last night as
a family, let's fucking do this.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.960
Going in the house
I was a nervous fucking wreck,

29:28.040 --> 29:30.000
but I couldn't have hoped
for better.

29:37.360 --> 29:40.360
Everyone's dancing, getting smashed,
drinks flowing.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.880
This is how it should be.
It's our last night.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.720
Chloe seems to have started
a dance-off.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.880
Honey, if you wanna be shown
how to move, step aside.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.160
Everyone's giving this
their best shot.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.120
Move aside, I'm coming through.

30:05.240 --> 30:09.480
Gary comes in and does this stupid
fucking shuffle. Anyone can do that!

30:09.560 --> 30:11.520
Try twerking upside down, bitch.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.560
Everyone's dancing ridiculously.
I fucking love these guys.

30:24.240 --> 30:28.000
Maybe because it's family night
and the options are limited,

30:28.080 --> 30:30.000
or that Chloe's looking canny fit,

30:30.080 --> 30:34.920
by the end of the night she'll find
her selfie on the end of my stick.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.720
I don't want to like Scott,
but he's being sweet,

30:40.800 --> 30:42.760
and it's making us like him more.

30:52.320 --> 30:56.720
It wouldn't be a last night without
a champagne spray. Party time!

31:02.560 --> 31:06.960
The time has come to go home,
but the party is gonna continue.

31:16.680 --> 31:22.000
Everybody knows, the best way to end
a night is with a kebab! Cheers.

31:22.080 --> 31:25.120
Everyone raise your kebab
to the family!

31:25.200 --> 31:26.320
Cheers!

31:28.640 --> 31:32.520
It's the first time I've ever done
a toast with kebab, but it's class.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.200
We're having so much fun.
To the hot tub!

31:40.480 --> 31:42.600
(laughter)
Shit!

31:42.680 --> 31:45.720
I've haven't been out here
without falling on me arse.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.280
I stink of kebab so while everyone
goes in the hot tub I'm going to bed.

31:59.040 --> 32:03.440
It's amazing how much we can fall
out, argue and fight in this house,

32:03.520 --> 32:06.320
but we'll still come back together
as a family.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.960
I love these people so much.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.160
After tomorrow it's gonna be so hard
waking up without them.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.760
Chloe,
we've had a lot of fun in here.

32:17.760 --> 32:21.960
I've loved every single moment. I'm
absolutely gutted to be going home.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.480
Slumber party!
We're having so much fun.

32:26.560 --> 32:30.440
So we're going to the boys' room
for a slumber party.

32:37.760 --> 32:41.520
How cute is this?
We're all in the same room,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.960
everyone's getting along.
A great end.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.320
I'm happy.
I've had the best night ever.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.240
Everyone's in the boys' room,
but there's only one way

32:53.320 --> 32:56.400
me and Holly wanna end the night,
in bed together.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.880
I knew there was a reason why me
and Kyle had to be together.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.600
He knows how I like to be woken up.

33:04.560 --> 33:05.840
(moans)

33:07.520 --> 33:10.640
Marnie's left the room,
so me and Gary swap beds.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.560
She is gonna have
the shock of her life.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.680
(laughter)

33:19.760 --> 33:21.240
These boys are arseholes.

33:21.320 --> 33:25.400
I've left the room for two seconds
and they're playing pranks on us.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.920
Everyone's tired
and wants to go to sleep.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.280
I'm sleeping next to Scotty T.

33:34.240 --> 33:38.600
I'm buckled and next thing, me pipe
finds itself in Chloe's mouth.

33:49.960 --> 33:53.560
I wish the lads would shut up.
How's Chloe supposed to talk

33:53.640 --> 33:56.040
and suck me off?
She's not that clever!

33:58.840 --> 34:03.360
I've completed me first BJ, I feel
mint. I go to see if he enjoyed it.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.800
The fucker's asleep.
Better sort meself out.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.040
(whirring)

34:26.440 --> 34:29.160
Have you brought
your vibrator in here? Yeah.

34:29.240 --> 34:33.240
I'm trying to get to sleep
and all I can hear is, mmmmmmmmm.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.680
She's actually not joking,
I can hear it vibrating.

34:36.760 --> 34:39.760
(whirring)

34:45.280 --> 34:48.360
Kyle, what the fuck's in me hair?

34:48.440 --> 34:52.240
I've woken up next to Kyle this
morning and I am absolutely dying.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.120
Last night was amazing.
I can't believe it's the end.

34:55.200 --> 34:57.600
You have a little bit of kebab.
Oh.

34:59.600 --> 35:00.920
Chloe...

35:04.840 --> 35:09.280
Last night you were sucking dick.
No, I wasn't. Yeah, you were.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.200
Chloe's a liar. She likes the D
in her mouth. Scott got lucky.

35:13.280 --> 35:18.000
(all chanting) Chloe sucks dick!
Chloe sucks dick!

35:18.080 --> 35:21.040
Could you tell
it was her first time?

35:22.400 --> 35:24.520
Scott's beefing me blow job tekkers.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.640
That's the last time I'm going near
his German sausage.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.840
You're a liar!

35:37.040 --> 35:40.960
It's always so depressing
and so difficult packing to leave.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.240
I'm gonna hate
not being here tomorrow.

35:49.560 --> 35:53.040
The thing about the house
is some people go and some come,

35:53.120 --> 35:56.600
but one thing remains the same.
We're a family and we're mad.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.360
Yeah.
Yeah.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.920
I feel I've inherited a new family.
I've gained four new brothers

36:03.000 --> 36:05.640
and four new sisters.
And I'm buzzing.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.120
I feel a bit emotional.
Aw.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.480
I was so nervous coming in,
in case yous didn't like us.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.680
But yous have been so welcoming.
Yeah.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.320
I can't believe the time's up.
It's gone so quick.

36:20.400 --> 36:24.400
It's been the best experience
of me life. I'm gonna miss everyone.

36:24.480 --> 36:28.760
These aren't mine!
These aren't my knickers.

36:28.840 --> 36:32.680
Stop lying, they are so yours.
They are not my knickers.

36:35.400 --> 36:39.000
Me and Charlotte, once again,
have been through so much.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.240
I wanna make sure everything is OK.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.760
This time round, it has been
obviously different for us.Yeah.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.720
Telling her I had a girlfriend
was the hardest thing

36:47.800 --> 36:49.800
I've ever had to do in this house.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.080
Do you think Lillie's the one?

36:52.160 --> 36:57.040
I would not be with a girl I didn't
see a future, you know what I mean?

36:57.120 --> 37:00.960
I didn't think I'd ever accept
the fact that Gary had a girlfriend.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.120
But I'm gonna have
to get used to it.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.960
We're all packed. I can't believe
it's that time again.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.680
Do yous feel part of the family?
Yeah. Yeah.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.280
You've both came out of your
shell so quick. You've done amazing.

37:23.800 --> 37:25.440
Been dead nice.
(laughter)

37:25.520 --> 37:28.040
I'm gutted to be leaving
the house first.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.560
It's gonna be weird
not seeing their faces.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.280
I'm gonna get lonely.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.640
Oh. I think I'm gonna cry.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.720
I don't wanna go, despite
the fights and the arguments,

37:37.800 --> 37:40.080
I'm leaving with a group
of best friends.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.360
Give us a kiss, Chlo.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.560
Erm, what about mine?

37:43.640 --> 37:46.560
(laughs) Come 'ere.
Come 'ere.

37:46.640 --> 37:51.440
It's been a rollercoaster. It's a
ride I'd get on over and over again.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.200
I'm gonna get off anyway now, crew.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.680
I'm pure devastated
to be leaving again.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.160
These fuckers are my brothers
and sisters. I'm gonna miss them.

38:00.240 --> 38:01.840
Bye, Scotty T!

38:01.920 --> 38:03.360
Wicked.
Bye, Scott.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.800
Kyle, let's say bye to our bedroom
one last time.

38:09.880 --> 38:14.480
I'm proud of us. I don't think
we've argued that much.Fuck off.

38:14.560 --> 38:18.040
This has been so much fun.
I wouldn't change it for the world.

38:18.120 --> 38:22.960
You never know maybe next time,
yous might even have sex.(laughter)

38:23.040 --> 38:24.480
It's gotta happen one time.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.960
Nah.
No!What?

38:27.040 --> 38:29.920
(laughter)

38:30.000 --> 38:33.400
Marnie's pretending she doesn't
want us, but we know she does.

38:33.480 --> 38:37.160
Stop trying to play cool, you
fucking idiot. Bye. See you later.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.760
Right, fuck off now, both of you.
(laughter)

38:46.840 --> 38:50.200
I'm gutted to be leaving
this mad house

38:50.280 --> 38:53.240
and these idiots that I love so much,
but it's time to go.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.000
Aaron, get your bag. We're off.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.480
See yous later.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.640
(all) Bye.

38:57.720 --> 39:00.400
It's time to leave and I'm gutted.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.320
When I leave, I'm leaving
all me best mates behind.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.680
It's been a journey for us three.
Yeah.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.840
We've all been through a lot.
Three best friends.Oh, God!

39:15.920 --> 39:18.000
Oh, God, now I'm gonna cry.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.280
It's hard because there's been times
I've wanted to leave.

39:21.360 --> 39:25.560
But when we're actually going,
I don't wanna leave at all.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.160
I don't want it all to be over.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.040
We'll all have each other, won't we?
Yeah.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.120
So am I.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.720
I went into that house with Holly
and Kyle being me best friends.

39:39.800 --> 39:43.800
We argued to the point where I
didn't think we'd be close again.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.000
But we're walking out of that house,
closer than ever.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.200
Bye, I love you.
Love you as well. Love yous both.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.800
I'll miss ya.
I'll miss yous.

39:51.880 --> 39:54.640
Me and Holly
have had our ups and downs,

39:54.720 --> 39:56.840
but we've come through
stronger than ever.

39:56.920 --> 40:00.640
We've never been in a relationship,
so who knows what the future holds?

40:00.720 --> 40:02.720
Want us to get your case?
Yeah.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.720
I have had so many ups
and downs in this house.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.160
I left
and thought I'd never come back.

40:08.240 --> 40:11.840
But fucking hell, I've had
the best time of my entire life.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.440
(screaming)

40:18.000 --> 40:19.560
Hello?
What the hell?

40:19.640 --> 40:21.720
Bambi on ice has just arrived!

40:21.800 --> 40:23.680
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.440
Let's get fucking buckled.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.720
Come on, Gaz, get your dick out.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.880
We've been shagging, a lot.
(moaning)

40:44.160 --> 40:46.680
We are gonna meet
Gary Beadle's girlfriend.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.200
Die, Lillie, die!

40:51.080 --> 40:52.080
Fuck it!

41:04.800 --> 41:07.200
What an absolute cake buzz.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.640
I've met someone else.
(sniffs)

41:14.080 --> 41:18.400
This is the one and only time
me heart has been broken by Gary.

41:18.480 --> 41:21.800
I have liked you
more than you have ever liked me.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.480
I've made a decision to leave here.

41:26.720 --> 41:29.120
I fucking love you, right?

41:29.200 --> 41:31.080
Dead fucking silence.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.800
(sobs)

41:41.040 --> 41:44.080
Bye, James. I'll miss ya.
I'll miss you too.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.440
All I've ever known
is Geordie Shore.

41:55.400 --> 41:59.400
I want you as me girlfriend.
I want you as me lass.Oh, my God!

42:05.080 --> 42:07.920
Me fucking fanny
has slipped out me undercrackers.

42:34.360 --> 42:34.560
.
