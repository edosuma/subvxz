That was very good, Kyle.

of Latinos in the arts.

Here is Eric Cartman.

Eric Cartman?!

01:10.988 --> 01:11.655

01:11.781 --> 01:13.699
The Latino culture

Jennifer Lopez?
- No way.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.241
Hey, I spent weeks
preparing, too, Kyle.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.492
No, you didn't, asshole!

02:38.617 --> 02:40.411
What you did was totally stupid
and racist,

02:40.536 --> 02:42.163
and you only did it
to screw me over!

02:42.288 --> 02:44.623
Aw, I don't think Kyle
likes you, Ms. Lopez.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.750
Aw.

Hey, Ms. Lopez has to eat, too.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.740
She's not eating it. It's just
coming out her backside.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.618

out <i>your</i> backside, too, cholo.

younger singer

07:35.831 --> 07:37.040
has come to our attention.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.667
And -- And the truth
of the matter is,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.420
her name happens to be
Jennifer Lopez as well.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.756
And we really can't have two
here at BHI records.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.968
Who the hell is this
other Jennifer Lopez?!

07:48.093 --> 07:49.595
Where is she come from?!

07:49.720 --> 07:51.889
Well, she lives in South Park,
Colorado, now.

07:52.014 --> 07:54.850
But I-I believe she's originally
from Mexico, just like you.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.894
I don't come from no Mexico!

07:57.019 --> 07:58.228
I'm Puerto Rican!

07:58.353 --> 08:00.147
Whatever.
Look, it's nothing personal.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.899
We just think
you need to move on.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.400
And you're a meanspirited bitch

08:03.525 --> 08:05.527
who spits on people
who aren't rich and famous.

08:05.652 --> 08:09.031
And sources say that the
new film will star Ben Affleck.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.450
That's me.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.247
and they want Ms. Lopez
to record an album next week.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.248
Really?
- Wow!

08:59.373 --> 09:00.666
- Really?
- No.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.377
Yeah. Looks like I'm gonna be
rich -- and famous.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.920
Okay, children.
Let's take our seats.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.088
If you'll remember yesterday,

09:06.213 --> 09:07.631
we were discussing
state capitals --

09:07.756 --> 09:11.343
Hey! A big limousine just pulled
up in front of the school!

09:11.468 --> 09:13.011
Butters, will you
pay attention, please?

09:13.136 --> 09:15.681
Holy smokes!
It's Jennifer Lopez!

09:15.806 --> 09:16.848
Jennifer Lopez?

09:16.974 --> 09:17.724
Yes?

09:17.849 --> 09:20.102
Holy geez wow!
There's Ben Affleck, too!

09:20.227 --> 09:21.019
Wow! Cool!

09:21.144 --> 09:22.145
Will you kids shut up?

09:22.271 --> 09:24.147
Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck
are not --

09:24.273 --> 09:26.483
Oh, my God. That's
Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.988
Oh, Jesus.
Will you look at those boots?

09:31.113 --> 09:33.532
Well, what are we waiting for?!
Let's get outside!

09:33.657 --> 09:34.658
Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

09:36.118 --> 09:37.744
Is it true
Jennifer Lopez is here?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.413
Here she comes!
Here she comes!

09:39.538 --> 09:40.539
Okay!

09:40.664 --> 09:42.499
What smart-mouth
little punk-ass bitch

09:42.624 --> 09:45.711
has been saying they're
the new Jennifer Lopez, huh?!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.963
J-Lo, can we get a picture
of you with the kids?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.631
No!
Shut up!

09:49.756 --> 09:53.010
If I find the ho who think
she's taking my career from me,

09:53.135 --> 09:56.054
I'm gonna wring her
pretty little neck.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.724
So, nobody wants to fess up,
huh?

09:58.849 --> 09:59.975
Too scared to talk?

10:00.100 --> 10:03.186
You better remember, bitch,
that I'll come and take you down

10:03.312 --> 10:05.981
if you ever say anything again.

10:06.940 --> 10:10.360
You can suck my <i>culo,</i> chica!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.614
Who was that?!

10:15.407 --> 10:16.742
You got a problem?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.368
Not me!
- Then who?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.081
<i>Hola,</i> bitchola!

10:23.206 --> 10:24.958
What the hell is that?

10:25.083 --> 10:29.212
My name is Hennifer Hlopez,
and I like tacos and burritos.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.757
That?!
That's what replaced me?!

10:31.882 --> 10:32.924
I'm sure it was just a mistake.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.509
The only mistake was
when this ghetto trash

10:34.635 --> 10:35.886
got signed in the first place.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.054
Shut your Goddamn mouth!

10:37.179 --> 10:39.598
You fucking smart-ass!
Who do you think you are?

10:39.723 --> 10:42.100
Nobody!
- I am Hennifer Hlopez!

10:42.225 --> 10:43.894
I eat tacos and burritos!

10:44.019 --> 10:44.895
Fuck you!

10:45.020 --> 10:46.438
Aah!

10:46.563 --> 10:48.398
I'm sorry!
I-I'll stop! I'll stop!

10:48.523 --> 10:50.192
You better stop!
- I will!

10:50.317 --> 10:51.568
Come on, Jenny.
Let's go.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.111
Wow!
Ben Affleck!

10:53.236 --> 10:56.198
We should be getting
back to the...

11:07.542 --> 11:10.003
Don't you forget
what'll happen to you, ho!

11:10.128 --> 11:11.254
Come on, Benny!

11:19.346 --> 11:22.015
Well, there you go, fat ass.
I hope you learned your lesson.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.058
Yeah, I sure did.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.851
I don't think I should record
that album now.

11:24.976 --> 11:25.686
Good.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.521
Or maybe I should!

11:27.646 --> 11:28.730
Aw, God damn it.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.148
Oh, no, no, no, Ms. Lopez.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.650
Oh, <i>sí, sí, sí, señor!</i>

11:31.775 --> 11:32.693
That does it.
I'm out.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.736
Aw, where are you going, Kyle?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.613
Come give me kisses!

11:38.365 --> 11:40.951

Ms. Lopez won't go to sleep!

12:38.925 --> 12:40.969
Yes?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.305
Hey, I was wondering
if I could talk to Ms. Lopez.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.514
She's not here right now.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.558
Ben?
Is that my darling Ben?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.643
Jenny?
Yes, Jenny, I-it's me!

12:48.769 --> 12:49.686
Where are you?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.480
Please.
I have to see her!

12:53.315 --> 12:54.191
Ben!

12:54.316 --> 12:56.651
Oh, you brought me r-r-r-roses!

12:56.777 --> 12:57.694

12:57.819 --> 13:00.489
Oh, Jenny, I just can't stop
thinking about you.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.074
I can't stop thinking
about you either, Ben!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.951
I've been meaning to write
a song or poem,

13:05.076 --> 13:05.994
but I have no talent.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.163
I know, my darling.
That's okay.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.248
Will you just take a ride
with me in my awesome car?

13:10.373 --> 13:11.666
Oh, Ben, I would love to!

13:11.792 --> 13:12.667
No!

13:14.294 --> 13:15.545
Don't you ruin this opportunity
for me.

13:15.670 --> 13:16.588
How can you stand in the way
of this?

13:16.713 --> 13:17.589
I'm not going out in his car.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.799
I'm not gonna let you blow
this one chance I have.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.343
I don't care. I'm supposed to
sit here and do my homework.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.355

- But what?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.315
But what if you still have
feelings for the slut

14:17.440 --> 14:18.733
with the large ass?

14:19.776 --> 14:22.529
I still care for her.
Maybe I always will.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.156
But you just have
so much more going on...

14:25.282 --> 14:26.157
up here.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.547
You cholos can't even keep
a beat!

15:22.672 --> 15:25.592
I deserve better than this!
I am Hennifer Hlopez!

15:25.717 --> 15:27.010
Where is my water?!

15:27.135 --> 15:30.430
Not Evian!
Pellegrino, you stupid bitch!

15:30.555 --> 15:32.098
Uh, that's fine, Ms. Lopez.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.266
Look, it's been a long night.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.893
Why don't we pick it up
in the morning?

15:35.018 --> 15:37.812
Fine, my ass, cholo!
I'll tell you when it's fine!

15:39.272 --> 15:40.148
Stupid idiots!

How am I supposed to make
an album with those cholos?

15:43.652 --> 15:46.237
You little snot nose!

15:46.363 --> 15:49.699
You ruin my career, and now
you're trying to steal my man?

15:49.824 --> 15:51.159
Oh, crap.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.827
You better stay away from him!

15:52.953 --> 15:54.287
Ow! Ow!

15:54.412 --> 15:56.164
Oh, Jesus!
Hey!

15:58.416 --> 16:00.669
Your son's hand
has a hairline fracture

16:00.794 --> 16:02.003
and two dislocated fingers.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.088
Oh, dear!

16:03.213 --> 16:05.256
But I'm more concerned
about his state of mind.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.009
Your son appears to be
completely insane.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.594
Ohh...

16:09.719 --> 16:10.971
Ohh...

16:11.096 --> 16:12.681
I told you this would happen.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.516
Oh, hello, guys.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.851
Cartman, you need to stop
this stupid game you're playing.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.104
Oh, Kyle, why you no like me?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.438
Kyle is right, Ms. Lopez.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.816
From now on, we're staying away
from Ben Affleck.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.192
I hate you.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.235
Come on, sweetie.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.071
Doctor says you need to get home
and get lots of rest.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.037
Aah!

16:37.038 --> 16:38.915
Mom!

16:39.791 --> 16:41.292
What is it, sweetie?

16:41.418 --> 16:43.670
Ben Affleck is naked in my bed!

16:43.795 --> 16:47.465
Ooh, looks like the tooth fairy
was extra happy with you!

16:47.590 --> 16:49.634
<i>Buenos días,</i> my love!

16:49.759 --> 16:51.553
Good morning, baby.
- You have to get out of here!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.430
Jennifer Lopez is gonna
kick my ass again!

16:53.555 --> 16:54.931
He's not going anywhere!

16:55.056 --> 16:57.100
Ben and I were up all night
making love!

16:57.225 --> 16:58.852
What? Aww!

16:58.977 --> 17:00.854
Ben Affleck's spooge!

17:00.979 --> 17:02.856
Should we tell him the news?
- What news?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.607
- think we should tell him.
- It's all right?

17:04.733 --> 17:05.859
'S all right.
- 'S all right.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.527
We're getting married!

17:07.652 --> 17:09.487
Oh, balls.

17:11.489 --> 17:12.866
Come in.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.453
Come in!

17:16.578 --> 17:19.372
Guys, I need to talk to you.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.541
What's the matter?
- I can't handle it anymore --

17:21.666 --> 17:23.293
all the fame
and the Ben Affleck spooge.

17:23.418 --> 17:25.795
I-I just can't go on living
with Ms. Lopez.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.756
So stop doing it.
- Stop doing what?

17:27.881 --> 17:29.674
You know Goddamn well what.
Now, get out of here!

17:29.799 --> 17:30.592
Please, you guys.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.887
It's like I can't even have
a moment to myself anymore. See?

17:35.388 --> 17:37.724
Don't you dare ever do that
to me again!

17:37.849 --> 17:39.851
Oh, stop it, Cartman! Your hand
doesn't need to breathe!

17:39.976 --> 17:41.811
You try being in an oven mitt
for two hours!

17:41.936 --> 17:43.063
I can see your lips moving!

17:43.188 --> 17:44.939
I can see your lips moving,
too, <i>culo!</i>

17:45.065 --> 17:46.357
See?
I just saw your lips move!

17:46.483 --> 17:48.026
Look, I'm just asking
you guys for help.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.944
Will you please help me
with Ms. Lopez?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.029
What's she doing?

17:51.154 --> 17:52.989
Come here!

17:53.114 --> 17:54.866
You're not actually buying
this crap, are you?

17:54.991 --> 17:56.451
I don't know.
M-Maybe he <i>can't</i> help it.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.328
Look, he knows full well
what he's doing.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.038
And he's just waiting for us
to buy into it.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.373
And then he'll laugh and point
in our faces and say, "Ha ha!

18:02.499 --> 18:05.085
I got you guys to believe me!
You guys are stupid!"

18:05.210 --> 18:06.836
You really think
he would go through all this

18:06.961 --> 18:08.338
just to make us look dumb?

18:08.463 --> 18:09.756
Yes, dude!

18:09.881 --> 18:12.008
Cartman, we've decided
that if you can be mature

18:12.133 --> 18:13.343
and admit to everyone

18:13.468 --> 18:15.929
that you've gotten yourself into
this mess, then we'll help you.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.138
Okay, okay.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.557
I know that I control everything
Ms. Lopez does.

18:19.682 --> 18:20.892
Oh, no, you don't!

18:21.017 --> 18:22.143
Quiet, Ms. Lopez!

18:22.268 --> 18:23.186
Out.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.395
Guys!

18:28.983 --> 18:31.069
There you are, Jenny!

18:31.194 --> 18:33.613
I've been looking
all over for you, baby!

18:33.738 --> 18:35.115
Aah!

18:35.240 --> 18:36.866
Jenny?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.410
Ms. Lopez, you were due
in the studio two hours ago.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.703
Come on!

18:43.331 --> 18:45.792
So you're getting married, huh?!

18:46.918 --> 18:48.670
Aah! Aah!

18:48.795 --> 18:50.213
Don't you hurt her!

18:50.338 --> 18:52.090
We'll sue you!

18:52.215 --> 18:53.216
Oh, Jesus.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.929
Aah!

19:00.431 --> 19:02.142
Freeze, leaf blower!

19:03.268 --> 19:04.352
Arrest that woman!

19:04.477 --> 19:06.312
She wants to kill
one of our artists!

19:06.437 --> 19:08.940
All right. You're going
downtown, bean breath.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.317
Jenny! Oh, I thought
I was going to lose you!

19:11.442 --> 19:13.153
Let's run away
and get married tonight!

19:13.278 --> 19:15.780
She can't get married tonight!
She has a recording session.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.657
Our love is like rain!

19:17.782 --> 19:19.659
That's what you said about me,
asshole!

19:19.784 --> 19:21.202
Quiet!
- Get her out of here!

19:21.327 --> 19:24.164
Fuck you!
- Shut up, picante pants!

19:24.289 --> 19:26.416
Everyone be quiet!

19:27.792 --> 19:30.461
I...I'm not who you think I am.

19:31.087 --> 19:31.963
You're not?

19:32.088 --> 19:34.299
No.
It was all a lie.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.551
A lie I cannot continue anymore.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.636
I am not Hennifer Hlopez.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.014
I am...

19:41.139 --> 19:43.349
Mitch Connor.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.603
Who's Mitch Connor?

19:46.728 --> 19:48.188
Just your run-of-the-mill
con man.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.856
I've been moving
from town to town,

19:49.981 --> 19:51.733
scamming people since I was 15.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.318
But I'm tired of runnin'.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.445
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.988
I've been a cheat all my life,

19:57.113 --> 19:58.740
and now I've ruined
a singer's career,

19:58.865 --> 20:00.366
lost a record company millions,

20:00.491 --> 20:02.493
and cost this little boy
his precious time.

20:02.619 --> 20:03.828
Stop. It.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.413
Mostly, I'm sorry to you, Ben.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.041
I'm sorry I played tiddlywinks
with your heart.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.295
But it's over now.

20:12.420 --> 20:15.506
The cyanide pill I took should
be taking effect very soon.

20:15.632 --> 20:16.799
Hm.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.385
Looks like the sun
is going down.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.181
I wonder...will I dream?

20:30.688 --> 20:34.651
Well, looks like Mitch Connor
has cashed in his last chips.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.571
Dude, who the hell
is Mitch Connor?

20:38.696 --> 20:40.198
I don't know, Kyle, all right?

20:40.323 --> 20:42.116
Look, I don't care
what you guys believe.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.202
But with all the crazy stuff
that goes on in this town,

20:44.327 --> 20:46.329
isn't it possible --
just possible --

20:46.454 --> 20:49.040
that something I don't
understand happened here?

20:51.501 --> 20:53.920
All right. All right.
I guess it's possible.

This is where all your cheeses
and lettuce will go on.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.226
Ow!
Look out, muffin head!

21:08.351 --> 21:09.602
Uh, look, Ms. Lopez,

21:09.727 --> 21:12.313
if you're going to be a member
of the La Taco family,

21:12.438 --> 21:14.691
you're gonna have to learn
to get along with people.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.359
Get a what with who?!

21:16.484 --> 21:18.111
Why don't you start chopping
those onions,

21:18.236 --> 21:19.779
and I'll check on you
a little later?

21:22.740 --> 21:23.950
This is bullshit!

21:24.075 --> 21:26.869
How the fuck did I end up
working at a La Taco?

21:26.995 --> 21:28.579
I had six platinum records,

21:28.705 --> 21:31.374
and I starred in five
Hollywood movies!
