I don't think so.

we're gonna get an apology.

half of the story

Not like that's an excuse, but

to throw water at all.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.224
Like, I went to throw it
at Vinny

because he always reneges on
all of the bets that we do.

it's all your fault, though.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.931

- Yeah.

for your part in this.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.236
- Yes.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.838
- The tone of what happened
last night

08:24.838 --> 08:27.808

- Yeah, that's why I didn't
know it even hit you.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.719
And then you were throwing
a water at me.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.021
I just went and
grabbed whatever.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.656
And I didn't even realize
it was, like, wine.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.024
And then I threw it.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.092
I'm so sorry I did that,
by the way. I had no clue.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.628

taking responsibility

for her actions last night.

This doesn't happen often
with her, so I appreciate it.

- Always...

- Mm-hmm.

- Yeah, no.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.046
- Like, I don't want to fight

- The best thing you can do

Nah, things got heated.

I apologize as well
for pouring wine on you.

- Yeah, I apologize.
I apologize to you also.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.959
- Yeah, and I apologize
for my involvement as well.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.494
So let's squash this.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.496
And at the end of the day,
it was Vinny's fault, anyway.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.699
- Yeah, Vinny's a dick.
- [laughs]

09:25.699 --> 09:27.834
- I think all of that happened,

09:27.834 --> 09:30.537
and then all of everything
in my own mind happened

09:30.537 --> 09:31.938
with, like,
me going through a divorce.

09:31.938 --> 09:33.573
So I think, like--
- Oh, dang.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.709
- I think it's been a lot,
all of this, for me.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.644
I also think this trip
has been, like, extra hard

09:37.644 --> 09:39.479
because usually, I'll have,
like, Chris in the room.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.248
So he, like--
you know what I'm saying?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.749
- Mm-hmm.
- I would have my person.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.484
- Mm-hmm.
- But right now, I'm just like,

09:44.484 --> 09:45.719
I feel so lost.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.187
And I think that's
another thing, too.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.555
So.
- Yep.

09:48.555 --> 09:51.057
- I can't wait to forget
about this, and moving on.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.859
- Yeah, we're good to
move on, too.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.328
- I'm going through
a lot of [bleep] in my life.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.764
<i>I keep a lot of stuff inside.</i>

09:57.764 --> 10:01.535
Because I've been [bleep]
over in my life by a lot of
people.

10:01.535 --> 10:04.771
- All right, let's go
check the damage out.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.907
- Like, even my own dad.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.475
<i>We didn't have
a great upbringing,</i>

10:08.475 --> 10:09.576
<i>you know what I'm saying?</i>

10:09.576 --> 10:11.645
So when I had this
defense wall up,

10:11.645 --> 10:13.146
I don't mean it--
harm for other people.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.347
And I don't mean it
towards other people.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.750
I mean it because
I have to do that.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.218
But with this whole--

10:18.218 --> 10:19.920
oh, my God, I'm gonna cry.

10:20.453 --> 10:23.957
Like, I have to defend myself
in this whole situation.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.192
<i>And I've been doing it
for, like, a while.</i>

10:26.192 --> 10:29.529
So I literally have been
having a hard time

10:29.529 --> 10:31.498
being on this trip.

10:31.498 --> 10:32.632
<i>- This--

10:37.504 --> 10:41.274
The whole door is
legitimately broke.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.842
- Looking like somebody
broke in over here.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.012
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.647
<i>There's a doorknob
on the floor.</i>

10:47.647 --> 10:49.015
<i>I mean, it looks like
there's blood</i>

10:49.015 --> 10:50.784
all over the [bleep] wall.
It's like somebody died.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.085
Well, it is what it is.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.820
It is crazy.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.555
So this morning,
I got a text from Deena.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.357
And she's like,
"Ange, was it a prank?"

10:57.357 --> 10:58.658
I'm like, what are you talk--
what is this girl

10:58.658 --> 11:00.026
talking about?
- Oh.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.595
- She was like, "Are you
and Pauly pranking me?"

11:01.595 --> 11:03.730
And I'm like--
- Bro, matter of fact,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.599
let's run with that
a little bit.

11:05.599 --> 11:07.067
And you know
what we can do is--

11:07.067 --> 11:08.134
'cause they probably think

11:08.134 --> 11:09.336
we're talking right now.
- Yeah.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.204
- Let's pretend
the talk went south.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.872
My prank wheels are going.

11:12.872 --> 11:16.076
I'ma go to meet them at lunch
and be like, "Ugh, I'm done.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.344
Like, I can't do it anymore."

11:17.344 --> 11:19.713
Let's prank them and say
the talk didn't go well.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.314
- There's no reasoning
with her, yeah.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.749
- There was no apology
on any end.

11:22.749 --> 11:23.883
"I don't know, this girl
will never change."

11:23.883 --> 11:24.985
This, that,
and the other thing.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.119
I'm gonna make it
real, real big.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.487
I'm gonna make it, like,
a disaster.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.089
- Deena was really into--
like, she was like,

11:29.089 --> 11:30.757
she thinks it's a prank.
- Yeah, they're shook.

11:30.757 --> 11:33.293
- So let's give her her prank.
- Let's do it.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.428
I need to put on
my acting shoes right now

11:35.428 --> 11:36.696
<i>'cause I have to
really pull this off.</i>

11:36.696 --> 11:38.865
They know me so well,
I have to sell it.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.133
- Good luck, good luck.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.301
- Thank you.
- Kill it, kill it, kill it.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.569
- I love pranks
this time of year.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.137
- And then I said,
"Pauly's easy.

11:44.137 --> 11:45.739
"If you apologize and own it,

11:45.739 --> 11:47.674
he'll move on,
and it'll be fine."

11:47.674 --> 11:48.775
- I think if you
want her to own it,

11:48.775 --> 11:50.076
you drive yourself more crazy.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.678
- And there he is!

11:51.678 --> 11:53.580
- Yo.
- Hey, Paul.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.015
- Well--[sighs]

11:55.015 --> 11:57.217
It's one of those vacations.
You were right.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.485
- So you had
a sit-down with her?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.353
- Oh, my God,
this girl is unreasonable.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.288
She came in with the Pedialyte,
blaming it on alcohol.

12:02.288 --> 12:03.423
You had one drink.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.824
She was basically
putting it on him,

12:04.824 --> 12:06.926
saying it was all his fault
because of the "JK."

12:06.926 --> 12:08.094
This is exactly
what we were saying.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.896
It was exactly
what you guys said.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.331
- Told you so.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.699
- And Nikki's pissed,
and I don't know what to do.

12:12.699 --> 12:13.767
She wants to leave.
And I don't want to leave.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.001
- Do you want me
to talk to her?

12:15.001 --> 12:16.169
I've been in it multiple times.
- Please.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.170
In my head, I'm like,
"Don't do that."

12:17.170 --> 12:18.705
<i>- I'll go up right now.</i>

12:18.705 --> 12:20.206
- [quietly]
Holy [bleep]!

12:20.206 --> 12:23.109
- I don't--I don't even know
what to say at this point.

12:23.109 --> 12:24.844
I thought--
I didn't even want an apology.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.479
Just be like,
"Oh, [bleep] got crazy."

12:26.479 --> 12:28.014
No, no, no.
"Oh, [bleep] Vinny."

12:28.014 --> 12:29.816

last night.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.095
<i>I know that it's a prank.</i>

12:42.095 --> 12:43.730
- I don't know
how to handle her.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.298
- By the inflection
in his voice.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.767
- What did she say
to get Nikki upset?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.035
- So--she--

12:49.035 --> 12:52.272
Nikki was just basically
saying that we--we--we--

- I knew it.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.879
- I'm too sick for this.

[bleep] pranks.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.123

13:10.123 --> 13:11.458
How did you break the door?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.659
Was that already broke?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.061
What?
- [laughs]

13:15.061 --> 13:17.130
- Was last night real,
and this is a prank?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.198
Or was the whole thing a prank?

13:18.198 --> 13:19.666
- Deena, come on.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.868
- [laughs]

13:21.868 --> 13:23.000
<i>Prank war champion!</i>

13:25.502 --> 13:27.070

13:27.070 --> 13:28.705

13:28.705 --> 13:31.575
See, but I thought
all of you were in on it.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.110
- Deena still doesn't
understand that last night--

13:33.110 --> 13:34.378
like, she thinks
it wasn't real.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.612
She still won't let up.

13:35.612 --> 13:38.382
- This girl was hysterical
last night.

13:38.382 --> 13:39.516
- [bleep] off.

13:39.516 --> 13:40.650
- How did you break the door?

13:40.650 --> 13:42.152

13:42.152 --> 13:44.721
- [laughs]
- What?

13:44.721 --> 13:45.922
- The only thing
that was a prank

13:45.922 --> 13:47.557
was her and I's
sit-down went well.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.826
I sold it that it
didn't go well.

13:49.826 --> 13:51.795
- Oh.
- That's the only prank.

and be excited about no carbs.

sneak some snacks.
