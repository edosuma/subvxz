It'd only be a matter of time
before she told the wrong person.

12:47.065 --> 12:50.365
Michael, relax.
No one's telling anyone anything.

12:53.571 --> 12:55.630
Come on, Kyle!

- <i>God! Oh!</i>

13:02.647 --> 13:04.672
Aaah! Oh, man!

13:10.422 --> 13:12.413
Oh, no.

13:16.394 --> 13:18.385
No, no.

13:33.678 --> 13:35.612
- New home delivery service?
- Oh. No.

13:35.680 --> 13:38.115
Actually, I was just bringing
a pie over to Kyle's.

13:39.417 --> 13:41.385
- Oh.
- Yeah. I heard that he...

13:41.453 --> 13:43.512
uh, broke his ankle, so-

13:43.588 --> 13:45.647
- That's too bad.
- Yeah. I--

13:45.723 --> 13:47.953
I kind of feel
a bit responsible...

13:48.026 --> 13:50.996
because I distracted him
at the game, and-

13:51.062 --> 13:54.054
Anyway, it's not a big deal.
lt'sjust-

13:54.132 --> 13:56.601
- Pie.
- Right.

13:56.668 --> 13:58.659
Uh, <i>I'll</i> see you.

14:03.074 --> 14:06.374
Nice of you to come by, Sheriff.
I'm much better today.

14:06.444 --> 14:09.573
Good. Thank God
Max was here, huh?

14:09.647 --> 14:11.911
I know.

14:11.983 --> 14:14.543
Max is a nice kid, isn't he?

14:14.619 --> 14:17.247
- Special.
- He is.

14:17.322 --> 14:19.757
I hope he's doing okay.

14:19.824 --> 14:22.418
Seems to have been around
a couple of near misses lately.

14:22.494 --> 14:26.124
- A couple? - Yeah, well, you remember
that whole shooting incident...

14:26.197 --> 14:28.393
at the Crashdown Cafe
back in September?

14:29.868 --> 14:33.668
Yeah, I remember.
What does Max have to do with that?

14:33.738 --> 14:36.673
- He never mentioned that?
- No.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.402
Huh.

14:38.476 --> 14:41.377
Sheriff, was Max
involved in that somehow?

14:41.446 --> 14:43.505
[Exhales]

14:43.581 --> 14:45.743
Just water under the bridge,
I guess.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.878
You seem to have some
sort of interest in my son.

14:48.953 --> 14:51.854
<i>I'd like to know why that is.</i>

14:51.923 --> 14:54.688
If Max was involved in
some sort of crime, Sheriff--

14:54.759 --> 14:56.921
Mrs. Evans, I didn't
come here to alarm you.

14:56.995 --> 15:01.364
I just wanted to make sure that
you're feeling better, and I, uh...

15:01.432 --> 15:05.198
I also want to drop off this pamphlet
on household emergencies.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.898
I highlighted the section
on grease fires for you.

15:07.972 --> 15:09.770
It's helpful information,
that's all.

15:09.841 --> 15:13.368
I'll let myself out.
You have a good day.

- [ Si <i>ghs</i> ]

15:37.134 --> 15:40.297
You're doing it wrong.
You're gripping the wood too tight.

15:40.370 --> 15:43.465
- Look, I know how to grip. Okay?
- Apparently you don't.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.531
Look, I have to
finish this. All right?

15:45.609 --> 15:48.476
I have my final project,
and it's a disaster. So-

15:52.416 --> 15:56.046
- It doesn't look that bad.
- Oh,yeah. I'm a regular Bob Vila.

15:56.119 --> 15:58.053
No, I'm serious.
It's actually pretty good.

15:58.121 --> 16:01.182
Once you put it together,
the shoes can go right there.

16:01.258 --> 16:03.283
What do shoes
have to do with this?

16:04.962 --> 16:08.762
- You're making a shoe tree, right?
- No, I'm making a napkin holder.

16:08.832 --> 16:12.928
Oh. Well- sure it'll be nice
once you put it together.

16:13.003 --> 16:15.472
Look, do you have
something you want?

16:17.975 --> 16:20.637
I just saw you in here,
and I wanted to say hi...

16:20.711 --> 16:24.045
but apparently
it was the wrong move.

16:24.114 --> 16:26.378
- I'll never do it again. Sorry. Good-bye.
- Fine.

16:26.450 --> 16:28.817
Run away. Perfect.

16:28.886 --> 16:31.082
What the hell's
going on with you?

16:31.154 --> 16:33.316
All right?
I mean, what did I do?

16:33.390 --> 16:35.381
Nothing. That's the problem.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.621
- What?
- Michael...

16:39.696 --> 16:41.721
we saved YOLJI' ass.

16:41.798 --> 16:46.065
Okay? You were all flunked-out,
sweating, you know...

16:46.136 --> 16:49.071

and, like, dying.

16:49.139 --> 16:51.631
I could have walked away
and never looked back.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.642
But I didn't.
I did not walk away.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.146
There I was, dragging
your sweaty, gross body...

16:57.214 --> 16:59.148
through the Indian reservation,
you know...

16:59.216 --> 17:02.880

and... worrying.

17:02.953 --> 17:04.978
'Cause, you know,

17:05.055 --> 17:07.547
I thought
you weren't gonna make it.

17:07.624 --> 17:09.718
Look.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.262
I went out on a limb for you...

17:12.329 --> 17:14.888
and you hug Max and Isabel...

17:14.964 --> 17:17.093
and it's all about
the three of you.

gonna thank me?

need them for the midterm.

to talk about it.

doing up so late?

Mom, really.

19:17.454 --> 19:20.822
You're gonna give me a complex
if you don't stop talking about this.

19:20.891 --> 19:24.521
Tell me again, Max.
Tell me how you did it.

- Howl did it?
- Yeah.

19:27.364 --> 19:29.696
You saw the flames,
and then you did what?

19:30.867 --> 19:33.529
Well, I- I ran to the stove...

19:33.603 --> 19:37.665
and I grabbed the pot of water
that was sitting there, and I threw it at the fire.

19:37.741 --> 19:39.675
That's all I did.

19:41.044 --> 19:43.809
It was a grease fire, Max.

Oh, Max! The more time we spend
doing nothing about this...

20:15.378 --> 20:18.109
the more time it gives Valenti
to make her curious about us.

20:18.181 --> 20:20.616
We are dealing with two people
who don't know anything.

20:20.684 --> 20:23.278
We're dealing with two people
who know something isn't right.

20:23.353 --> 20:27.620
We can't just do a Max on this thing. We can't
just sit back and passively watch.

20:27.691 --> 20:29.625
I'm not passively watching.

20:29.693 --> 20:32.094
Snap out of it, okay?
We're in trouble here.

20:32.162 --> 20:34.256
- We have to do something.
- Do what?

20:34.331 --> 20:36.925

Tell her the truth.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.334

- I don't think you do.

Don't you see?

We're not just hiding it
from her now. We're--

21:03.460 --> 21:05.451

Now we're lying to her.

21:07.130 --> 21:10.100
I don't know how much longer
I can do that.

21:10.167 --> 21:12.602
What if Mom found out
it's all been a sham?

21:12.669 --> 21:15.434
If we took her family away from her,
it would destroy her.

21:15.505 --> 21:17.473
Maybe it would
make us all closer.

21:17.541 --> 21:20.010
I don't think so.

21:20.076 --> 21:22.010
What are you saying?

21:22.078 --> 21:25.605
That if we tell Mom the truth about us,
she won't love us anymore?

21:25.682 --> 21:28.743
I'm saying we'll never know
the answer to that question.

21:30.453 --> 21:33.445
Max. This isn't
just your decision.

can you tell me
what you remember?

talked about this much-

22:08.558 --> 22:13.018
about you and your brother before
Daddy and I came into the picture.

22:13.096 --> 22:16.259

remember much, Mom.

22:19.236 --> 22:21.170

seeing you and Daddy...

22:39.656 --> 22:41.590
the day that you came
to adopt us...

22:41.658 --> 22:44.355

this yellow sweater.

Mom, I don't know
if you can understand this...

23:01.478 --> 23:05.506
but the day that you
and Daddy came for us...

23:05.582 --> 23:07.880

to you. What's that really about?

What is it about?

23:34.544 --> 23:38.674
- I'll tell you what it's about. It's a tactic.
- Oh, it's a tactic.

23:38.748 --> 23:43.276
That's right. It's your way of making me
think that I'm indebted to you.

23:43.353 --> 23:45.947
Let me tell you something.
I'm not indebted to anyone.

23:46.022 --> 23:48.423
