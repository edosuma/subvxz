18:11.824 --> 18:13.660
(PANTING)

18:15.328 --> 18:16.496
Welcome back.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.498
(PANTING)

18:29.809 --> 18:31.244
(SHAKY BREATH) I killed them.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.583
All those people.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.453
We were in the cargo hold
of a ship being transported.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.422
Wasn't your fault.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.258
Then whose was it?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.829
The one who takes control.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.133
Your dark self.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.870
Please, you need to eat.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.208
(CHINA SHATTERING)

19:07.214 --> 19:08.781
Why would you make me
remember that?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.250
Because...

19:11.351 --> 19:12.885
You need to know your enemy

19:13.620 --> 19:15.388
before you have any hope
of defeating him.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.360
The next step is to face him.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.531
What, do you mean
go back in there?

19:25.632 --> 19:26.766
This is your gift,

19:27.767 --> 19:28.835
it's not his.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.539
No way.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.943
I'm not going
through that again.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.212
Then you will never
be ready to leave.

19:45.785 --> 19:46.986
Do you really think that door,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.621
or any other,
leads to freedom?

19:50.423 --> 19:54.227
Unless you master your past,
you will always be a slave.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.707
(BIRD CAWING)

20:25.992 --> 20:27.394
QUINN: Loyalty

20:28.561 --> 20:31.831
is more than a virtue,
it, it's a religion.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.967
And every one of you
is an instrument

20:35.001 --> 20:37.337
of its divine retribution.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.406
For all you who remained

20:39.439 --> 20:41.441
by my side after
the Fort was taken,

20:42.375 --> 20:44.844
I promise something
far greater than any reward,

20:44.877 --> 20:47.414
I promise you redemption.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.583
Well, that's quite
the prize, Declan.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.751
Thank you, Baron.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.453
Who made the kill?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.856
-I did.
-Ah, Gabriel.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.258
This your first kill,
wasn't it?

20:59.559 --> 21:00.593
Yes, Baron.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.961
How did it feel?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.031
-Hmm?
-Easy.

21:05.898 --> 21:08.335
Next time you wet your blade,
it'll be with a man's blood.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.343
Carve it up.
Make everything ready.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.044
Tonight, we have much
to celebrate.

21:19.779 --> 21:20.880
(BABY CRYING)

21:34.594 --> 21:36.028
Spider's silk.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.333
Those curtains cost more

21:40.367 --> 21:41.868
than an entire shipment
of opium.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.372
Hello, Ryder.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.040
Well, you look
like your father.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.877
You look like you
survived quite the battle.

21:52.712 --> 21:53.980
Uh, can we bring some food,

21:54.013 --> 21:55.047
some wine from the kitchen?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.383
I'm fine, really.

21:56.583 --> 21:57.684
Please,

21:58.050 --> 21:59.386
I insist.

22:01.588 --> 22:02.955
What brings you
all the way here?

22:04.957 --> 22:08.561
It's the Nomads,
they raided us.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.766
Quinn always kept
my father's people protected.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.067
And now you need
my protection.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.472
You're my mother.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.008
Of course I'll help you.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.747
The gods will
bless you for this.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.516
Oh, you know I'm not
the religious type.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.483
Yeah,
but your Cogs are.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.820
Almost half of them worship
the same gods we do.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.823
Showing you're a friend
to the Totemists

22:36.856 --> 22:38.758
will help pacify
your own workers.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.128
And who says
they're not already?

22:42.829 --> 22:44.897
News travels slower
out in the wilds,

22:44.931 --> 22:46.666
but even I've heard
the stories...

22:48.100 --> 22:49.902
Cogs abandoning
your poppy fields

22:49.936 --> 22:50.970
to go work for The Widow?

22:51.638 --> 22:53.506
I'm handling The Widow.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.442
But that's not
what people think.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.410
Remember what
I taught you,

22:57.444 --> 22:58.578
you have to either
make them

22:58.611 --> 22:59.912
love you, or fear you.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.914
Perhaps I could help.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.816
Teach you to think
more like a Baron.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.418
Well, I am a Baron!

23:07.119 --> 23:09.055
And I am a damn good one.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.425
I don't need anyone's help,

23:14.927 --> 23:16.128
especially yours.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.432
(SIGHS) Such ingratitude

23:19.466 --> 23:21.734
and arrogance.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.035
Arrogance?

23:24.136 --> 23:25.972
Last time
I saw you, Mother,

23:28.608 --> 23:31.744
you told me I wouldn't
last a month without you.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.951
Let's see
if your Totemists

23:39.786 --> 23:41.621
can last that long
without me.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.992
One of my Cogs
will see you out.

Stop pulling!

23:56.068 --> 23:57.470
-Come on.
-All right!

23:58.738 --> 24:00.907
Hey, you did all right
back there.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.043
In fact, I tell you what.
We're a pretty good team,

24:04.877 --> 24:08.080
like thunder and lightning,
hammer and nails.

24:08.648 --> 24:09.916
More like ball and chain.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.752
I'm sorry, is that
Clipper humor?

24:13.986 --> 24:14.821
Very droll.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.889
Maybe you should stick
to punching people.

24:16.923 --> 24:17.957
Do you ever stop talking?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.025

24:58.030 --> 25:01.100
Yeah! Eating it?
Absolutely.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.502
Rub him well with garlic,

25:04.170 --> 25:05.504
roast it
over heather wood...

25:06.238 --> 25:07.273
That is
lip-smacking heaven.

is pregnant. Delicious.

25:49.882 --> 25:53.152
and I've never seen the Master
take on a novice before.

What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

back at you

I'm ready to go back.

were possible.

we both know how dangerous
it is for you out there.

Sunny left behind
so many enemies,

what might happen if one ever
got their hands on his child.

That boy is lucky
to have you, Veil.

31:10.169 --> 31:11.337
We both are.

31:12.338 --> 31:15.975
Some evenings I,
I lie awake, thinking

31:16.008 --> 31:17.309
what might have become of me

31:17.343 --> 31:20.146
if you hadn't found me that
night Sunny abandoned you.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.050
Sunny didn't abandon me.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.386
Then he must be dead.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.424
That's the only explanation.

31:34.526 --> 31:35.661
Please, Veil,

31:36.495 --> 31:38.497
without each other,
we'd both be dead, too.

for sewing me back up.

to return the favor.

is destined for great things.

an honorable man.

Well, it's too bad he'll never
get to meet his grandson.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.076
I'm sure the boy
will live up to his name.

I'll find a way
to bring Henry sunlight.

Oh, you want my help now, huh?

You're welcome.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.108

(INDISTINCT CHANTING)

35:10.842 --> 35:12.411
A hundred years ago,

35:12.444 --> 35:15.281
it was the custom
for every Baron's child

35:15.314 --> 35:17.183
to be baptized in blood.

35:18.284 --> 35:19.885
But we've lost our way
since then.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.554
Forgotten the traditions that

35:22.588 --> 35:25.591
first forged the Badlands
out of chaos.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.296
Why, I myself neglected
this hallowed rite

35:30.329 --> 35:31.830
when my own son was born.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.303
And he repaid my omission

35:37.336 --> 35:40.339
with a lifetime of failure
and betrayals.

Tonight,

fate has offered me
a second chance.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.385
An opportunity
to set things right.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.221
Tonight,

35:55.554 --> 35:57.756
we bless the Badlands'
newest heir.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.255
Isn't he a beautiful child?

36:29.488 --> 36:30.522
Yes, Baron.

36:35.761 --> 36:36.928
And his mother, too?

36:39.398 --> 36:40.399
Hmm?

36:41.633 --> 36:43.469
Now, don't be shy.
I saw you

36:44.270 --> 36:46.305
watching her
as she suckled the child.

Ryder's called all the other

38:29.641 --> 38:30.709
(SIGHS) What's a conclave?

Something weak Barons call for

I knew it was a card

It's a dangerous card for us.

to persuade the other Barons

on the oil fields

Politics? Not really my style.

Politics is war

the other Barons,

39:34.573 --> 39:36.107
they have no stomach
for a battle.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.545
Nah, they'll wanna avoid
bloodshed if at all possible.

Those Barons are the people
responsible for the system

at us together.

and they decide that the best
thing for the Badlands

39:55.761 --> 39:56.928
is to slit my throat...
