00:07.800 --> 00:09.325
Morgan:
Rick?

00:10.840 --> 00:13.446
Rick:
I know this sounds insane,

00:13.600 --> 00:15.762
but this is an insane world.

00:15.920 --> 00:19.129
We have to come for them
before they come for us.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.851
- It's that simple.
- ( walkers snarling )

00:22.040 --> 00:24.964
This is where
it all starts tomorrow.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.441
Tobin gets in the truck,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.841
opens the exit and we're off.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.641
He hops out, catches up
with his team at red

00:33.840 --> 00:36.002
staying on the west side of the road.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.650
Daryl gets on his bike--

00:37.800 --> 00:40.565
-( rumbling )
- You see that?

00:40.720 --> 00:42.643
( Metal groaning )

00:59.560 --> 01:02.882
It's open!
We got to do this now!

01:03.080 --> 01:04.411
We're doing this now!

01:04.560 --> 01:06.642
Tobin's group,
get moving, go!

01:06.800 --> 01:09.121
- No, Rick, we're not ready.
- Sasha! Abraham!

01:09.280 --> 01:10.645
Abraham:
Damn straight, we'll do it live.

01:10.840 --> 01:13.241
You meet Daryl at red.
Let him take them through the gauntlet.

01:13.400 --> 01:15.641
- Yeah, we meet at red.
- Rick: Go!

01:23.560 --> 01:26.166
- Rick, I'll hit the tractor place.
- Okay, who else?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.731
We got to take them out
or they'll distract the horde.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.086
- I'm here, let me help.
- No.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.083
- I'm here! I will.
- Do everything I say.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.561
Rick, this was supposed to be a dry run.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.370
- Rick: Daryl, get ready.
- They're coming.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.403
Rick, we haven't even gone through
the whole plan.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.562
You want to go back, go back.
We're finishing this.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.405
Tobin, you hit it on my signal.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.848
They're heading for home.
We don't have a choice.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.407
Get ready to hit the flares.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.291
NQW!

Tobin, hit the truck!

( Theme music playing )

03:41.360 --> 03:43.727
You were wrong.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.809
Ron.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.369
( Door slams )

04:56.600 --> 05:00.047
- Thank you.
- Of course.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.248
Okay.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.890
(groaning )

05:13.080 --> 05:14.764
Glenn.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.763
Glenn, what happened?
Are you okay?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.291
I'm okay.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.761
You guys look like shit.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.847
She's fine. She's fine.
She's okay.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.444
Tara?

05:29.640 --> 05:31.483
I'm okay.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.762
You just check on them.

05:35.120 --> 05:36.884
- I'm okay.
- What happened?

05:37.040 --> 05:39.202
We were out there.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.324
The walkers and--
we're all right.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.048
Got winged by a ricochet.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.049
( Groans )

05:48.240 --> 05:50.322
It's all right.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.968
Holy shit.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.007
Thank God...

06:00.160 --> 06:02.049
nothing happened
to your hair.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.686
( Chuckles )

06:05.880 --> 06:08.326
Okay, Eugene's
freaking me out.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.290
Somebody want to send Noah in here
to protect me?

06:57.440 --> 07:00.523
You were right.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.409
It wasn't over.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.048
We should talk more tomorrow.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.085
Listen...

07:19.200 --> 07:21.726
I don't take chances anymore.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.403
And you shouldn't.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.882
( Ring clatters )

( snarling )

08:16.800 --> 08:18.484

08:20.800 --> 08:23.007
Rick on radio:
You all have your assignments.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.288
You know where to rendezvous.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.929
Daryl leads them out.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.731
Sasha and Abraham join him
at the bottom of the hill.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.611
( Flares fire )

08:36.799 --> 08:38.325
Rick:
Glenn, you hit us

08:38.480 --> 08:40.847
when you take care of the walkers
at the tractor place.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.486
That's the one thing
we gotta get ahead of.

08:45.400 --> 08:48.961
Everybody keep your heads.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.690
Just keep up.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.766
( Walkers snarling )

09:12.600 --> 09:15.524
( door opens )

09:17.040 --> 09:18.371
So, is he okay with it?

09:18.520 --> 09:20.682
It was pretty much his idea.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.683
He gets it.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.569
It's got a bed and a bath,

09:24.720 --> 09:27.326
but it's still a cage, you know?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.244
He gets it.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.370
He told me what happened out there
with the trucks.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.808
He tell you about
those guys he met?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.041
The Ws.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.443
Like that walker
we saw, yeah.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.325
We need more watch points.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.723
And I'm gonna tell Deanna we don't need
to go looking for people anymore.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.567
You feel different about it?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.402
Yeah, I do.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.127
Well, people out there,

10:02.280 --> 10:05.648
they got to take care of themselves,
just like us.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.247
I'm gonna get him out.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.006
Shouldn't leave him in there
any longer than we have to.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.810
You good?

10:21.960 --> 10:23.769
Yeah.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.241
I'm trying.

10:29.720 --> 10:32.451
Listen, if you're still looking to go
buck wild with the breath impaired...

10:32.600 --> 10:35.729
You already asked the question
and I already answered it.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.484
If you were so worried, why the hell
did you get into the car with me?

10:51.640 --> 10:55.281
Listen, doing something
as big as this...

10:57.240 --> 10:58.765
...that's living.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.450
There it is.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.886
Sasha on radio:
We're at red at the bottom of the hill.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.486
Daryl on radio:
All right, here comes the parade.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.803
Where'd you learn that?

11:45.320 --> 11:47.482
A friend.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.842
Before or after?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.844
I ask, you answer.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.164
It's common courtesy, right?

11:58.360 --> 12:00.567
( Chuckles )

12:00.720 --> 12:02.802
It was after.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.205
After everything.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.681
Look, I'm sorry for this,
for having to do this.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.251
It's all right.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.721
The way I look at it,

12:13.880 --> 12:16.486
sometimes you're safer
when there's no way out.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.641
Got to get to know
each other again.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.844
For the first time...

12:26.000 --> 12:27.889
again.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.922
( Car approaches )

12:35.200 --> 12:39.683
- ( car door opens, closes )
- Man: Hey, it's us.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.047
We're back. You gonna let us
in or what?

12:46.400 --> 12:49.483
I'm technically not authorized,
so I will not be doing so.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.881
- Who the hell are you?
- You first.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.242
I'm Heath.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.882
I live here. My team's been on a run
the last couple weeks.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.928
I'm Eugene.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.481
Aaron brought myself and my group here
directly within that window,

13:08.680 --> 13:11.763
so we haven't had the chance to meet and
I can't exactly confirm your residence.

13:11.920 --> 13:13.888
Open the gate.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.566
If I do, how do I know
you won't attempt to kill me?

13:16.720 --> 13:20.122
( Chuckles ) Okay, look,
I'm not gonna kill you.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.725
But the longer
you make me wait,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.087
the more you motivate me
to beat your ass, so...

13:26.440 --> 13:28.602
( gate unlocks )

13:28.760 --> 13:30.250
Thank you.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.171
So Deanna put you on gate duty?

13:53.320 --> 13:56.881
Oh, no, I'm not proper duty.
This is Holly's shift.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.371
I was just walking by.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.528
She asked if I could
relieve her for a few ticks.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.045
I said, "No, thank you"
and she ignored me,

14:02.200 --> 14:03.770
which is obviously
what I should have done

14:03.920 --> 14:06.764
as it's been at least five ticks
and still no Holly.

14:06.920 --> 14:09.048
( Car door opens )

14:10.480 --> 14:13.370
I'm Scott.
This is Annie.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.284
Hi.
Good to meet you.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.090
How many of you
are there?

14:17.240 --> 14:18.605
13.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.650
I mean, 12.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.609
Annie:
I'm sorry.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.165
I'll close up.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.082
( Gate squeaking )

14:38.120 --> 14:40.122
( engine starts )

14:42.200 --> 14:44.407
Anything big happen
while we were gone?

14:44.560 --> 14:46.961
Well, we had a meeting
last night.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.771
( Lock clangs )

14:49.920 --> 14:53.208
Oh, yeah?
About what?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.169
You might want
to talk to Deanna.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.926
Get it from the horse.
Her mouth.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.804
You know?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.726
Right.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.649
Hey, it's good to see
someone like me.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.491
I fully respect the hair game.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.329
- Who put up the wall?
- They did.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.522
There was a man, Reg.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.923
He drew up plans,
made it happen early on.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.445
A lot of people in here.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.001
They've been inside
from the start.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.562
They had food, energy,
not a whole lot of walkers.

15:31.720 --> 15:33.882
They just lived.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.168
They haven't had to survive.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.687
They figured that out,
brought us in.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.644
Still might be too late.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.689
Too late how?

15:43.840 --> 15:46.207
For them to come around.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.522
We'll see.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.409
You'll have to talk
to Deanna.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.483
She's the woman
in charge.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.921
She was married to Reg.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.764
Was?

15:58.280 --> 16:00.362
Yeah.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.722
What are you doing?

16:17.200 --> 16:19.089
We're--

16:19.240 --> 16:21.368
I wanted to help.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.522
We only need one.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.923
We have two men here.

16:27.080 --> 16:30.243
We're not gonna bury killers
inside these walls.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.363
I understand how you feel.
I do.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.922
But it's not your decision.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.731
Tobin.

16:41.880 --> 16:43.928
Rick's right.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.446
Take it away.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.046
Go west.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.924
Down Branton Road
a few miles.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.964
Just past the bridge.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.447
We don't go out
that way.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.288
Let the trees have him.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.971
I shot him
because he killed Reg.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.288
That was it.
We didn't have a choice.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.682
You do have a cell.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.287
Not for killers.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.961
I'm a killer, Rick.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.891
I am,
and you are, too.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.001
Glenn,
you there yet?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.447
Glenn: Almost. We'll have it handled
before they get here.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.840
And we'll meet you
at yellow.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.401
Copy that.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.525
It'll hold.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.364
Well, that's good.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.682
You know, considering
where we're standing.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.049
Michonne.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.690
Yeah?

18:34.880 --> 18:37.565
Back when you were
in that place...

18:39.120 --> 18:40.963
where I lived...

18:44.040 --> 18:46.566
did you take one
of my protein bars?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.169
No.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.091
See, I could have sworn
there was one more peanut butter left.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.727
( Sighs )
That's how it is, isn't it?

19:00.880 --> 19:04.930
You always think there's one more
peanut butter left.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.568
(walkers growling )

19:14.440 --> 19:17.444
( car approaching )

19:34.440 --> 19:36.204
Morgan.

19:41.200 --> 19:43.328
Maybe we just
leave him here.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.803
That's not who you are.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.965
I know.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.088
<i>He'! '</i>

20:06.960 --> 20:09.122
You don't.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.640
( Distant walkers
growling )

20:34.000 --> 20:35.764
Morgan.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.003
Morgan.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.289
Stop.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.969
Did you hear that?

20:47.120 --> 20:49.771
(wind whistling )

20:52.320 --> 20:54.641
(walkers growling )

21:11.200 --> 21:12.850
( walkers snarling )

21:17.840 --> 21:19.842
(grunts)

21:54.720 --> 21:57.724
( walkers snarling )

23:02.120 --> 23:04.487
What are you doing
out here, Ron?

23:06.120 --> 23:08.805
I wanted to know
where my dad was buried.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.322
Rick:
This is how.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.886
How what?

23:39.040 --> 23:43.284
How the community's still here.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.562
They've had walkers
at their walls,

23:45.720 --> 23:49.361
but a lot of them,
maybe most of them,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.682
they wound up here.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.564
Ron.

24:30.720 --> 24:33.246
- Ron.
- I'm going back.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.209
- Hey.
- I'm fine.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.328
You shouldn't be out here.

24:38.760 --> 24:40.808
I don't care what you think.

24:40.960 --> 24:43.281
It's not what I think,
it's what I know.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.568
You can't protect yourself.
I'll show you how,

24:45.720 --> 24:47.290
but right now you have
no idea what you're doing.

24:47.440 --> 24:51.240
And if you come out here,
you're gonna die.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.926
And it won't be quick
and it won't ever be over

24:54.080 --> 24:58.404
'cause you'll be one of them.
That's what's gonna happen.

24:58.600 --> 25:00.921
You're coming back
with us now.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.608
Don't make it hard.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.007
Rick on radio:
Glenn, you have to hurry.

26:09.160 --> 26:11.686
The noise could distract
the herd right off the road.

26:11.880 --> 26:13.450
- Talk to me.
- Glenn: We're here.

26:13.600 --> 26:16.126
(growling, banging)

26:22.400 --> 26:23.686
Nicholas:
Sounds like a lot.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.002
(growling, banging)

26:26.160 --> 26:28.970
- We need it quiet.
- So what's the plan?

26:30.440 --> 26:33.444
Take 'em out
a few at a time.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.044
Nicholas,
you're at the door.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.282
All right.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.568
You let one or two out
and then you close it.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.927
You keep doing that, that's the trick.
That's how we control it.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.445
- Heath--
- Wait, what if he can't close it?

26:54.600 --> 26:55.681
- I'll be able to.
- Then we take them on.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.370
We take them on?

26:57.520 --> 26:59.602
If we get into trouble,
we go behind the building,

26:59.800 --> 27:01.802
into the woods
and we draw them away.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.691
Hey, you've been out
on runs since he got here.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.922
He knows what he's doing.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.560
Me and Aiden, we didn't.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.565
This was supposed to be
a dress rehearsal.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.563
I'm supposed to be
delivering pizzas, man.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.246
Daryl's leading them this way

27:19.400 --> 27:20.731
and they're closing in.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.644
That noise is gonna pull
the herd right off the road

27:22.800 --> 27:24.165
and then we have
serious trouble.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.084
We have to do this.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.401
Yeah, okay.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.641
- Okay?
- Okay,

27:28.800 --> 27:30.370
<i>- okay -
- Okay -</i>

27:30.520 --> 27:32.568
All right.

27:32.720 --> 27:36.008
Glenn:
On three. Ready?

27:37.840 --> 27:38.921
One...

27:40.400 --> 27:41.731
two...

27:43.200 --> 27:45.009
three!

27:48.720 --> 27:50.131
Shit!

27:50.280 --> 27:52.567
( Banging )

27:56.000 --> 27:58.401
(growling, banging)

28:03.560 --> 28:05.210
Heath:
My team...

28:05.360 --> 28:06.725
we saw it early on,

28:06.880 --> 28:10.123
back when we were on
one of those first scouts,

28:10.280 --> 28:12.203
finding out
what was around here.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.761
There was a camp
at the bottom.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.567
The people, they must have blocked
the exits with one of those trucks

28:18.720 --> 28:21.200
back when everything
started to go bad.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.124
They didn't make it.
They were all roamers.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.725
Maybe a dozen of them.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.451
No one's been back since?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.291
DC,

28:30.440 --> 28:33.489
every town worth scavenging
are all in the other direction.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.803
And I never really felt like having a
picnic next to the camp that ate itself.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.691
So all the while the walkers
have been drawn by the sound

28:39.840 --> 28:41.968
and they're making more sound
and they're drawing more in.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.441
And here we are.

28:46.280 --> 28:50.490
Now what I'm proposing,
I know it sounds risky,

28:50.640 --> 28:53.450
but walkers are already
slipping through the exits.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.080
One of the trucks
keeping the walkers in

28:56.240 --> 28:57.924
could go off the edge
any day now.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.447
Maybe after one more
hard rain.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.126
That exit sends them east.

29:03.280 --> 29:06.409
All of them.
Right at us.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.690
This isn't about
if it gives, it's when.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.330
It's gonna happen.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.522
That's why we have
to do this soon.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.684
This is-- I don't even have
another word for it.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.161
This is terrifying.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.840
All of it.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.766
But it doesn't sound like
there's any other way.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.481
Maybe there is.

29:33.640 --> 29:37.440
I mean, couldn't we just build up
the weak spots?

29:37.600 --> 29:41.685
I could draw up plans.
I worked on the wall with Reg.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.726
Construction crew--
we can try and make it safe.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.042
Even if we could,
the sound of those walkers

29:48.200 --> 29:50.362
is drawing more
and more every day.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.364
Building up the exits
won't change that.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.210
Deanna:
We're gonna do what Rick says,

29:55.360 --> 29:57.488
the plan he's laid out.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.884
I told you all, we're gonna have Daryl
leading them away.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.849
Sasha:
Me, too.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.402
I'll take a car,
ride next to him.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.722
Can't just be him.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.884
I'll keep 'em coming, Daryl keeps 'em
from getting sloppy.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.560
I'll go with her.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.724
It's a long way
to white-knuckle it solo.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.403
We'll have two teams.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.962
One on each side of the forest
helping manage this thing.

30:29.120 --> 30:32.044
We're gonna have a few people on watch
from now on.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.089
Rosita, Spencer, and Holly.

30:34.240 --> 30:37.005
So they're out.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.208
So who's in?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.769
Me.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.570
You should keep
an eye on her.

30:44.720 --> 30:47.291
Keep going with the plans
you talked about.

30:47.440 --> 30:48.930
Maggie:
I know, but this is important.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.447
She's important.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.568
People are scared.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.927
They need to see her
come back.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.283
That's not
the only reason.

31:02.440 --> 31:06.047
Yeah, it isn't.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.885
Okay.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.371
I'm In.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.405
I'd like to help as well.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.284
No. Who else?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.124
We need more.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.487
Carter:
There's got to be another play.

31:19.640 --> 31:23.087
We can't just control
that many.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.811
I said it before,
walkers herd up.

31:25.960 --> 31:27.644
They'll follow a path
if something's drawing them.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.689
That's how we can
get 'em all at once.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.003
So, what? We're supposed to just
take your word for it?

31:33.200 --> 31:36.807
We're all supposed to just fall in line
behind you after...

31:41.320 --> 31:43.163
After what?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.448
After you wave a gun around,

31:45.600 --> 31:47.841
screaming,
pointing it at people.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.048
After you shoot
a man in the face.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.170
- After you--
- Enough!

32:00.160 --> 32:02.925
I'll do it.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.650
Me, too.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.485
Whatever you need,
I'm in.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.881
Deanna:
Now who else?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.605
I'll go.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.767
We have to do this.
I need to help.

32:30.360 --> 32:32.328
You sure you can handle it?

32:33.680 --> 32:35.728
You need people.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.648
We'll make this work.
We'll keep this place safe.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.041
Keep our families safe.
We will.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.602
The plan.
Go through it again.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.921
Man, he just said it.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.607
Every part again.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.206
The exact plan.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.647
(walkers growling )

33:02.240 --> 33:05.403
( engine revving )

33:32.520 --> 33:34.488
Marshall and Redding.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.325
- We force them west here.
- Deanna: How?

33:37.480 --> 33:40.324
We block it off so they
can only go one way, west,

33:40.480 --> 33:42.209
away from the community.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.725
Carter:
Block it off with what?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.370
Cars.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.648
We'll use the RVs,
some of the bigger trucks,

33:47.800 --> 33:49.040
park them end to end.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.123
We'll be drawing them away.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.124
- They're gonna keep moving.
- Carter: Yeah, but that many?

33:54.280 --> 33:57.602
Just bouncing off some sedans?

33:57.800 --> 34:00.963
And then when they start
slipping through

34:01.120 --> 34:03.407
and the ones that walk away
start distracting the rest

34:03.600 --> 34:06.171
and you stop drawing them away?

34:08.280 --> 34:09.645
Man's got a point.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.041
Eugene:
We got plates.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.726
The big-ass metal ones
from the construction site.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.530
We can use them
to fortify the whip wall.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.809
It'd help disperse the force of impact
and direct the walkers clean.

34:19.960 --> 34:21.803
Like a pool table.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.882
That's an army out there.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.406
And what happens
when this doesn't hold?

34:28.560 --> 34:29.641
And they push on through.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.088
The curve in this hillside
is gonna send them right back east.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.686
Right back here.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.326
You seriously want to risk that?

34:38.480 --> 34:41.005
No.

34:41.159 --> 34:44.369
So you need to help us
to make it hold.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.002
These walls, you built them.

34:48.159 --> 34:50.925
So you've already done
the impossible.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.001
Carter.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.924
Please.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.004
- ( Engine roaring )
- ( walkers snarling )

35:30.320 --> 35:32.971
( metal rattling )

35:37.360 --> 35:40.011
( rattling continues )

35:50.600 --> 35:52.284
(snafls)

36:49.640 --> 36:51.722
( chatter)

37:12.840 --> 37:16.287
Hey, what you said before about us
needing to take care of ourselves?

37:17.760 --> 37:22.163
Going out finding more people,
that is taking care of ourselves.

37:26.360 --> 37:28.328
Your call, though.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.650
- Here.
- Thanks.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.683
You know, I can come
with all of you.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.967
You and Daryl have been
teaching me how to shoot.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.090
(sighs ) I think you got
the hang of it.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.571
Rick:
You should stay back,

37:55.720 --> 37:58.724
get a feel for how
people feel now.

37:58.920 --> 38:01.366
We still got a long way
to go with them.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.168
We'll get there.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.687
She's in charge.

38:07.840 --> 38:10.047
But you're in charge now.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.362
( Banging )

38:23.520 --> 38:25.966
- This is a bad idea.
- This is the only idea.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.009
I think there's something
like a dozen in there.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.044
We stay back, we get on opposite ends,
we draw them to each of us.

38:31.240 --> 38:32.685
- Try and take down four each?
- No.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.365
This is just me and Heath.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.409
You get back
and you stay back.

38:36.560 --> 38:38.961
Things go south, you tell Rick
and you draw them away.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.368
Just move back.

38:52.360 --> 38:54.203
He got Noah killed?

38:54.360 --> 38:57.091
He did.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.242
He did more than that.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.050
He lured Glenn into the woods
and tried to kill him.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.168
What the hell?

39:06.360 --> 39:08.124
- Yeah.
- What?

39:08.320 --> 39:10.721
Glenn told me I could tell everyone
if that's what I wanted to do.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.929
Could get Nicholas exiled.

39:14.120 --> 39:16.282
He'd die out there.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.408
Could have done that.

39:19.880 --> 39:21.291
You could do that now.

39:21.440 --> 39:24.284
He got Noah killed
and he tried to kill Glenn?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.882
Glenn saves people.

39:28.040 --> 39:29.963
Even people like that.

39:35.880 --> 39:37.882
I couldn't accept it either.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.089
But then I thought about you.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.290
How we were on different sides of
that fence on the worst day of my life.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.131
And now you're one of the most important
people in the world to me.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.930
Things can get better.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.884
We can make them better.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.644
You tell me
what you want to do.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.484
( Sniffles )

40:03.640 --> 40:08.487
I'm just gonna follow
your lead, okay?

40:08.640 --> 40:11.325
Okay.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.323
I'm sorry.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.685
You ready?

40:22.840 --> 40:26.367
No. But since you're
doing this thing anyway...

40:26.520 --> 40:28.363
All right.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.371
They're still coming.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.681
(gun clicks)

41:12.880 --> 41:15.406
(walker snarling )

41:23.520 --> 41:25.841
Get it.

41:26.040 --> 41:28.202
(grunts)

41:30.240 --> 41:31.571
Glenn: Good.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.370
Let's go.

41:54.520 --> 41:55.885
Here you go.

41:56.040 --> 41:57.610
Oh, thank you.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.524
It's Carol, right?

41:59.680 --> 42:01.284
Yeah.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.920
You been with Rick long?

42:04.120 --> 42:05.963
Since Atlanta.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.770
And were you a cop, too?

42:09.440 --> 42:11.124
Why would you think that?

42:11.280 --> 42:13.806
You're always watching.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.611
You always...

42:16.800 --> 42:19.326
seem ready.

42:19.480 --> 42:20.720
For what?

42:22.400 --> 42:24.528
You know,
to handle things.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.123
Aren't you sweet?

42:30.640 --> 42:32.881
( Snarling )

42:35.920 --> 42:38.400
What is it?

42:38.560 --> 42:42.451
Got some looky-loos taking a little
constitutional off the shoulder.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.167
They starting
a damn walkout.

42:46.320 --> 42:48.641
You want to have Daryl
circle back?

42:48.800 --> 42:50.484
No.

42:50.640 --> 42:52.642
Keep moving.
I'll catch up.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.604
Abraham.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.171
Idiot.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.525
Come on!

43:13.520 --> 43:15.010
Abraham: Come on!

43:17.000 --> 43:19.128
This is my ride,
asshole.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.209
Whoo!

43:31.840 --> 43:34.366
( Chuckles )
Well, look at me.

43:39.520 --> 43:41.841
You didn't see Reg

43:42.000 --> 43:44.048
the night he got it.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.049
That was a mess.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.369
And Pete.

43:52.560 --> 43:55.040
His face just...

43:55.200 --> 43:58.010
blowing up like Pompeii

43:58.160 --> 44:00.731
right when we were
cheek to cheek.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.040
I still think I got some of his brains
in my ear.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.925
( laughs )

44:14.720 --> 44:16.643
Well, look at that.

44:18.440 --> 44:20.442
All right.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.570
Everything is aces again.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.608
What the hell are you doing?

44:32.360 --> 44:35.807
I'm just grabbing
the bull by the nutsack.

44:35.960 --> 44:38.486
I'm living, darling,

44:38.640 --> 44:41.325
just like you.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.484
(laughing)

44:53.760 --> 44:56.127
I haven't had a chance
to say it yet,

44:56.280 --> 44:59.284
but I'm sorry about Reg.

45:00.600 --> 45:05.128
He was smart and kind.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.964
He was a good man.

45:11.280 --> 45:14.921
It was the right call.
We need this.

45:18.720 --> 45:22.281
What else?

45:22.440 --> 45:24.966
You need to tell me.

45:25.120 --> 45:27.805
People need to be armed
inside the walls.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.361
They need to be trained,
everyone.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.330
<i>_</i> ( twigs snap )
-( banging )

45:35.160 --> 45:36.730
Stop.

45:36.920 --> 45:39.685
Here they come.

45:39.880 --> 45:43.123
Carter, heads up.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.601
- Man: Wait, folks.
- Hey.

45:52.200 --> 45:55.010
Use your shovels.
The guns will draw more.

45:55.160 --> 45:57.049
Help us.

45:57.200 --> 46:00.010
You can do this.
You need to, all of you.

46:09.040 --> 46:10.246
Rick:
Morgan, don't!

46:10.400 --> 46:11.401
Shit!

46:33.320 --> 46:35.846
You said you don't
take chances anymore.

46:49.520 --> 46:51.409
Carter:
Time is running out.

46:51.560 --> 46:54.291
He's talking about a dry run tomorrow.
That's it.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.124
Olivia: Rick stopped Pete.
He stopped him.

46:56.280 --> 46:58.203
Carter:
This is not taking out a wife-beater.

46:58.360 --> 47:00.601
Tobin:
He was a murderer, Carter.

47:00.760 --> 47:03.525
Carter:
What Rick wants to do is suicide.

47:03.680 --> 47:08.971
I'm sorry, Spencer,
but Deanna is asleep at the wheel.

47:09.120 --> 47:13.444
So it's on us.
We have got to stop him.

47:13.640 --> 47:16.803
What the priest said about him,
about these people,

47:16.960 --> 47:18.610
he was right.

47:18.760 --> 47:22.321
How many more of us have to die

47:22.520 --> 47:24.124
before we do something?

47:24.280 --> 47:26.487
'Cause pretty soon
it's gonna be too late.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.689
Olivia: Carter, you need to be
really careful here.

47:29.840 --> 47:32.161
You're talking about us going to Deanna
and telling her--

47:32.320 --> 47:35.369
Carter: No, I'm not talking
about talking some more.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.727
About meetings.
I'm not talking about that.

47:37.880 --> 47:40.645
Plain and simple,
we kill him

47:40.800 --> 47:43.121
before he kills us.

47:43.280 --> 47:44.281
( Shatters )

47:47.240 --> 47:49.846
( clatters )

47:56.360 --> 47:58.567
Hello.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.848
Tobin:
Carter.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.685
- He heard.
- I didn't.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.968
- I mean, I didn't--
- Tobin: Carter.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.724
He heard.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.370
( Hammer clicks )

48:13.520 --> 48:16.126
Olivia:
Carter, don't. You can't.

48:16.280 --> 48:17.520
( Door opens )

48:22.840 --> 48:24.922
What the hell is going on?

48:26.720 --> 48:29.041
What are you doing?

48:29.200 --> 48:31.851
I'm taking this place
back from you.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.720
That's what you were
talking about in here?

48:36.880 --> 48:38.882
That's what he
was talking about.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.485
See, I would have--
I would have set up some lookouts.

48:46.640 --> 48:49.530
That would have been
the smart thing.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.409
You know,
if I happened to--

48:51.560 --> 48:54.086
- ( groans )
- ( hammer clicks )

48:54.280 --> 48:58.285
You really think you're gonna take
this community from us?

48:58.440 --> 49:00.681
From Glenn?
From Michonne?

49:00.840 --> 49:04.162
From Daryl?
From me?

49:04.320 --> 49:08.723
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

49:11.080 --> 49:13.048
- It was just me.
- What?

49:13.200 --> 49:14.565
It was--
it was just me.

49:14.760 --> 49:18.401
Just-- just kill me.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.764
Rick.

49:34.160 --> 49:38.210
I'm good.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.206
You can try
to work with us.

49:47.360 --> 49:50.250
You can try
to survive.

49:50.400 --> 49:52.562
Would you do that?

49:58.240 --> 50:00.402
( Snarling )

50:08.800 --> 50:10.802
(whistles )

50:22.320 --> 50:24.448
It's working.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.764
You were right.

50:32.920 --> 50:36.606
Everyone, we need
to finish this.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.088
We have to keep moving and fan out
down that thing front to back.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.810
Like we said,
cops at a parade.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.689
Glenn, you take the back.

50:43.840 --> 50:45.729
- You got the other walkie.
- Got it.

50:45.880 --> 50:47.609
If it gets sloppy,
we fire our weapons,

50:47.760 --> 50:49.808
pull them back on track.

50:49.960 --> 50:53.009
- I'll hit the front.
- Okay, one after the other.

Tobin, they're breaking off.

51:42.720 --> 51:44.131
Tobin:
What do you want us to do?

51:44.280 --> 51:46.362
Fire your guns
and draw them back.

51:52.160 --> 51:53.650
( Judith coughs )

51:53.800 --> 51:55.928
It's nice out.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.242
Yeah.

51:59.400 --> 52:00.811
Hope you don't mind.

52:00.960 --> 52:03.566
I wanted to enjoy the evening a little

52:03.760 --> 52:06.161
and I don't have a porch
over there, so...

52:12.760 --> 52:15.206
Get your stuff.

52:18.080 --> 52:21.129
You should stay
with us over here.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.282
Morgan:
You got room?

52:25.440 --> 52:27.329
Rick:
We'll make it.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.609
We don't need
to do that anymore.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.489
I know you, Morgan.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.888
Even if this is the first time.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.524
You want to hold her?

- This is Morgan.

He's a friend of mine.

53:12.320 --> 53:14.322
Hi.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.968
Okay.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.804
Let me have a look at you.

53:25.960 --> 53:28.611
Hey;
Hey;

53:34.120 --> 53:37.488
You with that man Carter,
in the armory--

53:37.640 --> 53:40.564
that's you.

53:40.720 --> 53:42.370
You're still the same man
I met in King County.

53:42.520 --> 53:44.921
The one that came back
and told me it wasn't over.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.685
That was you.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.889
Same you that's right in front of me
right now.

53:57.040 --> 53:59.247
I wanted to kill him.

54:01.840 --> 54:04.161
So it would be easier.

54:06.280 --> 54:09.170
So I wouldn't have to worry

54:09.320 --> 54:11.687
about how he could screw up

54:11.840 --> 54:15.401
or what stupid thing he'd do next
because that's who he is.

54:15.600 --> 54:19.002
Just somebody who
shouldn't be alive now.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.200
( Sighs )

54:22.400 --> 54:24.971
I wanted to kill him.

54:27.680 --> 54:31.048
But all that hit me and...

54:31.240 --> 54:33.811
I realized
I didn't have to do it.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.087
He doesn't get it.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.368
Somebody like that...

54:51.480 --> 54:53.847
They're gonna die
no matter what.

- Be quiet. Shh.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.967
- Oh, God.
- Carter. Carter, shh.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.407

- You got to be quiet.

It's working.

- Tobin: Copy that.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.687
What was that screaming?

56:00.840 --> 56:02.569
That was Carter.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.802
He got bit right in the face.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.809
I stopped him.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.047
We have a good hour
until we have 'em to green

56:18.200 --> 56:21.727
when we hand them off
to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.

56:21.880 --> 56:24.087
Why don't you head back,
tell everyone what's happening?

56:24.240 --> 56:26.049
- They should know.
- Okay, Rick, I just--

56:26.200 --> 56:27.929
Will you do that for me?

56:33.360 --> 56:35.169
I'll take care of that one.

56:35.320 --> 56:38.483
Michonne, you take point.

56:41.400 --> 56:44.210
I know it's how it is.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.930
I do.

56:47.960 --> 56:50.247
Yeah.

56:50.400 --> 56:52.368
I do, too.

57:07.960 --> 57:10.850

Hey.

57:34.760 --> 57:38.207
I was just getting
more flares for tomorrow.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.002
I know I haven't--

57:54.080 --> 57:55.844
I just-- I just thought
it might be best

57:56.000 --> 57:59.686
if I let things be
for a while.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.447
Ron told me
what happened.

58:03.600 --> 58:05.568
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

58:05.720 --> 58:08.041
- He shouldn't have been out there.
- No, he shouldn't have.

58:08.200 --> 58:11.090
You're right.

58:11.240 --> 58:14.881
But you can't talk
to him like that, Rick.

58:15.040 --> 58:17.042
You can't touch him.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.885
Not you.

58:20.040 --> 58:22.964
Ron needed to hear
every word I said.

58:23.120 --> 58:25.122
That's why I grabbed him.
I wasn't angry.

58:25.280 --> 58:27.009
I was just telling him the truth.

58:28.640 --> 58:32.326
If it's coming from you,
he can't hear it.

58:33.960 --> 58:36.804
You got to understand that.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.689
He needs to know
how to handle himself.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.968
- I can teach him. I can teach you.
- Rick.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.561
- You need to know how.
- Rick.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.844
When I found out
we could have them,

58:48.040 --> 58:50.168
I asked Rosita
to start showing me how.

58:50.320 --> 58:53.483
Okay? She's gonna teach me
and I'm gonna teach Ron

58:53.640 --> 58:55.642
and I'm gonna teach Sam.

58:58.760 --> 59:02.287
I heard what you were saying
to us at the meeting.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.808
And at my house
before... you know.

59:09.200 --> 59:11.931
I am gonna fight, Rick.

59:20.440 --> 59:23.330
( Snarling )

59:39.760 --> 59:41.091
All right,
this is the finish line.

59:41.240 --> 59:43.368
When we make it to green,
we fall back.

59:43.520 --> 59:45.966
The ditches and ridges
will keep them on the road.

59:46.120 --> 59:48.930
We head home,
but Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham

59:49.080 --> 59:51.287
take them the rest of the way,
20 miles more.

59:51.480 --> 59:53.050
All right, let's go.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.768
Got a question for you.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:07.241
Just some intel before
our little road trip tomorrow.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.243
Ask me.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.322
You doing this
'cause you want to die?

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.284
No.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.520
We're gonna take 'em
right past here.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.889
All that noise
could distract them.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.323
We'll clear it on
our way back tonight.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.801
We don't want
any surprises tomorrow.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.606
( Snarling, banging )

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.485
Hey, what you've done,

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.802
you're gonna sit with it a while,

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.371
'cause I don't want you
out here tomorrow.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.170
You're not ready.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.800
You will be.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.691
Some time soon,
I'll make sure of it.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.808
And then you start
to make it right.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.605
Thank you.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.845
( Snarling )

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.841
I know this sounds insane,

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.731
but this is an insane world.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:56.168
We have to come for them
before they come for us.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.971
It's that simple.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.361
( Snarling )

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.921
( horn blaring )

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.210
What the hell is happening?

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.045
It's a horn or something.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.726
It's pulling the back half
off the road.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.405
Oh, God.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.167
Michonne:
Whatever that is, it's far.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:02.324
- It sounds like it's coming from--
- Home.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.971
( Snarling )

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.171
( horn continues blaring )

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.169
( horn continues blaring )

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.124
( theme music playing )
