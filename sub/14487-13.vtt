Of course I would.

Are you?

11:14.931 --> 11:16.000
Certainly not.

to be involved.

way too much lipstick on.

Oh! Ooh! Ow!
Ooh!

20:40.826 --> 20:43.136
Well, Bender, I hope
this has taught you a lesson

20:43.205 --> 20:45.034
about changing your sex
to win five gold medals.

20:45.103 --> 20:47.000
[ soft voice]:
It truly has.

20:47.067 --> 20:50.550
My romance with Calculon
has shown me a lot about myself.

20:50.619 --> 20:51.964
Almost done.

20:52.034 --> 20:54.067
If only somehow, some way...

20:54.136 --> 20:57.309
[ normal voice]:
he and I could drive to Vegas

20:57.378 --> 20:58.931
pick up some floozy-bots

20:59.000 --> 21:03.034
and void their warranties
all night long! Whoo!

21:03.103 --> 21:04.448
Yay, my buddy's home.

21:04.517 --> 21:07.103
And his respect for women
is back to normal.

21:07.172 --> 21:09.240
I kind of hoped
this whole experience

21:09.309 --> 21:11.034
would have left you
a little more open

21:11.103 --> 21:12.309
to your sensitive side.

21:12.378 --> 21:14.275
Yeah, you'd think,
but what ya gonna do?

21:16.413 --> 21:18.654
[ thunder rolling]

21:18.723 --> 21:24.136
Coilette, the skies themselves
weep upon the sweetest flower

21:24.205 --> 21:25.586
of all the field.

21:25.654 --> 21:27.413
[ both sigh]

21:27.481 --> 21:28.931
Ew!Gross!

21:29.000 --> 21:30.481
Sentimental drivel poop.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.000
Come on, Bender,
let's go.

21:32.067 --> 21:34.034
This chick flick
is getting me all barfy.

21:34.103 --> 21:37.448
Yeah, emotions are dumb
and should be hated.

21:40.723 --> 21:42.964
Good night, forever,
my turtle dove.

21:43.034 --> 21:45.172
[ soft voice]:
Good night, Calculon.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.240
What did you say?

21:46.309 --> 21:47.413
[ normal voice]:
I said

21:47.481 --> 21:49.067
you two don't dress
trampy enough.

21:49.136 --> 21:50.689
I still got it.
