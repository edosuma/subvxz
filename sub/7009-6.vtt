WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:16.056
WILL THIS DAY EVER END?

00:16.224 --> 00:17.099
YESTERDAY DID.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.892
BUT TODAY'S FRIDAY, SO...

00:19.060 --> 00:21.145
NO.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.817
OH, GOD,
IT'S DESTROY AND GIVE-BACK.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.235
YEAH, WHY DO THEY
CALL THEM THAT?

00:28.403 --> 00:30.279
YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.573
HEY, FOREPLAY.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.574
OHH!

00:33.742 --> 00:34.616

00:34.784 --> 00:36.493
I BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.745

00:37.912 --> 00:38.662
THAT WAS GREAT!

00:38.830 --> 00:40.122
AND YOU GAVE IT BACK!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.666
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH HORSEPLAY.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.835
PIPE DOWN.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.755
I SAID, PIPE DOWN!

00:47.922 --> 00:51.050
NOW, I'VE GOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT
BEFORE STUDY HALL.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.595
WHOEVER BURNED THEIR INITIALS
IN THE FOOTBALL FIELD

00:54.763 --> 00:58.515
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY
WITH YOURSELF, PUNK.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.436
THERE'LL BE NO FOOTBALL PRACTICE
TODAY UNTIL WE'VE RE-SEEDED.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.105
AND I'VE WATCHED THAT TEAM.
I'M NOT IMPRESSED, BOY.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.815
LET ME TELL YOU.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.485
THEY NEED ALL THE PRACTICE
THEY CAN GET.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.905
ON A HAPPIER NOTE...

01:13.073 --> 01:15.699
ERIC?

01:15.867 --> 01:18.202
DONNA?

01:18.369 --> 01:20.829
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DO?

01:20.997 --> 01:23.457
ACTUALLY,
WE NEED TO BE EXCUSED.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.167
UH, DONNA AND I ARE...

01:25.335 --> 01:26.835

01:28.296 --> 01:30.255
WELL, IF YOU SAY SO, ERIC.

WHY ARE WE MOVING?

01:57.575 --> 01:58.158
MOMMY!

01:58.326 --> 02:04.039

02:06.668 --> 02:09.294
YEAH, RIGHT. SO WHAT WAS THERE,
LIKE A FIRE DRILL OR SOMETHING?

02:09.462 --> 02:11.421
NO. LOOK,
I DO BAD THINGS.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.549
[ALL LAUGH]

02:13.716 --> 02:14.758
I'VE DITCHED CLASS BEFORE.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.511
UH, IS OPIE GETTING ANGRY?

02:17.679 --> 02:20.055
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT CALLING ME OPIE?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.016
OPIE, LOOK OUT FOR THE KEG
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD!

02:35.155 --> 02:36.280
WOW.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.824
IT IS A KEG...

02:38.992 --> 02:40.826
OF BEER.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.245
IT MUST BE A SIGN.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.123
OF BEER.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.251
OH, THAT'S IT.
I'M CUTTING CLASS EVERY DAY.

HELLO, WISCONSIN!

03:27.582 --> 03:30.083
HOW DID YOU FIND IT?

03:30.251 --> 03:35.464
DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD,
MAN, AND THERE SHE WAS.

03:35.632 --> 03:39.468
OH, IT WAS THE BEER
IN THE HEADLIGHTS.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.556
THAT IS MY FIRST
AMERICAN JOKE.

03:44.724 --> 03:48.477
WOW. HOW OFTEN DO YOU FIND
A MYSTERIOUS KEG OF FREE BEER?

03:48.645 --> 03:51.146
ONLY ONCE IN A WHILE.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.105
YOU'RE RIGHT, FORMAN, MAN.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.024
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.068
WHEN GOD GIVES YOU A KEG,
YOU GOTTA...

03:56.236 --> 03:58.737
KILL A VIRGIN.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.785
NO.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.204
THROW A PARTY.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.001
GO FOR IT, ERIC.

04:13.169 --> 04:16.505
YEAH, WE'LL THROW A PARTY.
CHARGE 2 BUCKS A HEAD.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.257
2 BUCKS A HEAD.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.716
A KEG IS EQUIVALENT
TO SEVEN CASES.

04:19.884 --> 04:20.926
THAT'S 168 BEERS.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.344
IF WE EACH DRINK
THREE BEERS APIECE...

04:22.512 --> 04:24.471
NO WAY. SOPHOMORE'S
GONNA DRINK ONE, MAYBE.

04:24.639 --> 04:25.555
TRUE.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.976
AND THE FRESHMAN,
HE'S GONNA DRINK A HALF.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.270
SO THAT AVERAGES OUT
TO 1.5 BEERS PER PERSON,

04:31.437 --> 04:32.729
WHICH MEANS
WE CAN INVITE 112 PEOPLE.

04:32.897 --> 04:35.399
AND THAT'S 224 BUCKS.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.150
CASH.

04:37.318 --> 04:37.985
WHICH IS...

04:38.152 --> 04:41.321
DECENT.
DECENT.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.906
OK, GRAB SOME ICE
OUT OF THE DEEP FREEZE,

04:43.074 --> 04:44.908
I'LL GRAB THE TUB.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.327
OH, THAT IS ONE
SWEET MAMA.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.664
HEY, GANG.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.749
OH, OH, DON'T MIND ME.

04:52.917 --> 04:54.751
JUST CAME DOWN TO DO
AN EMERGENCY PRESOAK

04:54.919 --> 04:57.296
ON MY NURSE'S UNIFORM.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.048
YOU REMEMBER
MR. WILBUR THE FIREMAN?

05:00.216 --> 05:03.719
WELL, HE CAME IN TODAY
WITH A SEBACEOUS CYST,

05:03.886 --> 05:06.221
WHICH IS A, UM,
A POCKET OF FLUID

05:06.389 --> 05:09.725
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE
A PUS-EY BATH OIL BEAD

05:09.892 --> 05:10.934
UNDER THE SKIN.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.728
AND YOU THINK IT'S SOLID,

05:12.895 --> 05:14.271
BUT IF YOU TAKE
AN INSTRUMENT

05:14.439 --> 05:17.065
AND YOU PIERCE THE CORE,

05:17.233 --> 05:20.360
AND THEN YOU APPLY
PRESSURE WITH YOUR THUMB...

05:20.528 --> 05:21.695
WELL, HI, SNICKLEFRITZ.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.905
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE TUB?

05:24.073 --> 05:24.823
OH.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.408

05:26.576 --> 05:28.201
WE WERE JUST...

05:28.369 --> 05:31.246
W-WORKING ON
A CLASS PROJECT.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.666
WE'RE MAKING A VOLCANO.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.586
SNICKLEFRITZ.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.795
OUT OF ICE?

05:38.963 --> 05:42.591
WELL, I THINK
IT MIGHT MELT.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.301
WELL, YOU HEARD HER.
LET'S MOVE IT, GANG.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.012
OK, WELL, HAVE FUN.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.805

05:48.973 --> 05:51.350
WELL, WHERE ARE WE

05:51.517 --> 05:52.809
BEATS ME.
IF YOU GUYS NEED ME,

05:52.977 --> 05:55.312
I'LL BE WITH JACKIE OVER AT
OUR SECRET MAKE-OUT PLACE.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.563
SECRET MAKE-OUT PLACE.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.440
IT'S THIS VACANT HOUSE
OVER ON SHERMAN.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.233
I MEAN,
THIS PLACE IS GREAT.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.651
IT'S TOTALLY PRIVATE.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.945
YOU CAN GET AWAY
WITH ABOUT ANYTHING THERE.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.906
SO IF YOU GUYS FIND
A PLACE FOR THAT KEG,

06:06.074 --> 06:08.241
LET ME KNOW.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.916
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

06:17.502 --> 06:21.296
THAT'S A SYLVANIA,
ISN'T IT, RED?

06:21.464 --> 06:24.049
YOU DIDN'T BUY THAT
IN MY STORE, DID YA?

06:24.217 --> 06:27.427
NO, BOB. I, UH,

06:35.895 --> 06:38.438
WELL, I AM JUST

06:38.606 --> 06:40.524
RICH MAN, POOR MAN.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.234
I MISSED
THE FIRST EPISODE.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.194
HERE'S THE IRONY
OF THE SHOW, KITTY.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.197
THE RICH, SAFE GUY
IS BORING.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.323
IT'S THE POOR,
RUGGED ONE

06:48.491 --> 06:53.453
PLAYED BY THE VERY TALENTED
NICK NOLTE WHO'S SO EXCITING.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.621
WELL, SUPER.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.415
NOW, WHO WOULD
LIKE A DRINK?

06:56.582 --> 07:00.210
OOH! LET'S DO
DAIQUIRIS, HUH?

07:00.378 --> 07:02.504

07:02.672 --> 07:06.049
ERIC TOOK
A WHOLE TUBFUL.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.136
HE TOOK A TUB OF ICE?

07:09.303 --> 07:13.223
OH, THE KIDS ARE
MAKING A VOLCANO.

07:13.391 --> 07:18.311
RIGHT. THAT'S WHY DONNA
LEFT WITH ALL THE PLASTIC CUPS.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.983
PLASTIC CUPS?

07:23.151 --> 07:27.279
SURE. PLASTIC VOLCANO CUPS.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.447
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

07:28.614 --> 07:31.700
I'D SAY THEY WERE
HAVING A KEGGER.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.202
AW, JEEZ.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.745
LET'S GO, BOB.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.957
OOH, RICH MAN, POOR MAN,
I LOVE IT.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.335
I JUST HOPE I DON'T
GET TOO EMOTIONAL.

07:42.503 --> 07:44.713
OH, SO DO I.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.091
THOSE KIDS
COULD BE ANYWHERE.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.594
NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK.

07:50.761 --> 07:54.264
LOOK, THEY LEFT THE HOUSE IN
A WOOD-PANELED OCEAN LINER.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.100
WE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO FIND THEM.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.310
YEP...

07:58.478 --> 08:01.104
IT'S A REAL ASPHALT
JUNGLE OUT HERE.

08:01.272 --> 08:04.191
SUN GOES DOWN,
THE RATS COME OUT.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.444
I LOST MY MAILBOX
LAST YEAR.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.696
OH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

08:09.864 --> 08:14.534
THE EVIL SPILLING OVER
FROM SHEBOYGAN.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.578
OH, HOW MANY STORIES
DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE ARE

08:16.746 --> 08:19.706
IN THIS NAKED BURG?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.833
8, BOB.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.793
THERE ARE 8.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.131
MICHAEL, THIS IS OUR
SECRET MAKE-OUT PLACE.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.967
I DID NOT SWIPE THE KEY FROM
MY MOTHER'S REAL ESTATE OFFICE

08:31.135 --> 08:33.136
SO YOU COULD HAVE A PARTY.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.722
I KNOW,
IT'S LIKE A BONUS.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.099
I'M DOING IT
FOR YOU, BABY.

08:38.267 --> 08:39.518
OH.

08:39.685 --> 08:42.646
WELL, OK.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.691
WHEW.

08:46.859 --> 08:50.820
EMPTY POOL,
EMPTY HOUSE, FULL KEG.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.075

TO SHOW A GIRL A GOOD TIME.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.702
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T COLOR
OUTSIDE THE LINES OFTEN,

08:57.870 --> 09:01.206
BUT WHEN I DO,
JUMP BACK, LORETTA.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.917
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU ATE, FEZ.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.628
GET IN THE POOL NOW!

09:06.796 --> 09:09.756
IF I GET A CRAMP,
IT WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.842
OK.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.345
HURRY UP
AND DRINK YOUR KEG.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.265
HURRY UP

09:18.432 --> 09:19.766
JACKIE, WILL YOU JUST

09:19.934 --> 09:20.892
I MEAN, THIS RULES.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.353
WE GOT A KEG, AND SOON
EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE HERE.

09:23.521 --> 09:24.479
EVERYBODY?

09:24.647 --> 09:27.148
EVERYBODY
WHO MATTERS.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.359
AND FOR THE
FIRST TIME, JACKIE,

09:29.527 --> 09:31.736
THAT INCLUDES YOU.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.322
GET AWAY FROM ME!

09:35.241 --> 09:35.699
HUH!

09:35.866 --> 09:37.617
YOU HEARD HER,
LET'S DRINK BEER.

09:37.785 --> 09:38.326
ME FIRST.

09:38.494 --> 09:39.411
NO WAY.
I SPOTTED IT.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.205
I SAW IT, TOO.
I JUST DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.125
YOU SAW A KEG,
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING?

09:45.293 --> 09:47.877
BACK OF THE LINE!

09:48.045 --> 09:49.629
ALL RIGHT, HOW DO
YOU GET THE BEER OUT?

09:49.797 --> 09:50.922
THROUGH THE TAP.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.133
WHAT TAP?

09:54.051 --> 09:57.137
NOOOOOOOOO!

10:05.855 --> 10:08.940
OK, WE REALLY
NEED A TAP HERE.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.985
I GOT MY SWISS ARMY KNIFE.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.530
OH, GREAT, WE CAN
WHITTLE THE BEER OUT.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.824
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, THEY SELL
TAPS AT THE LIQUOR STORE.

10:17.992 --> 10:24.205
YEAH, AND WHO'S GOT
THE MONEY TO BUY IT, HUH?

10:24.373 --> 10:27.417
WHY WOULD I BRING MONEY TO OUR
SECRET MAKE-OUT PLACE, MICHAEL?

10:27.585 --> 10:28.668
OK, I'VE GOT MY GAS MONEY.

10:28.836 --> 10:32.505
NO, ERIC, WE'RE NOT GONNA
TAKE YOUR GAS MONEY.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.798
HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT,

10:33.966 --> 10:35.383
WE'LL HAVE MADE

10:35.551 --> 10:36.217
YEAH.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.803
MICHAEL, HOW ARE
WE GONNA MAKE $200?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.431
I DON'T KNOW.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.016
HEY, WHO'S
BUYING THE TAP?

10:43.184 --> 10:43.975
YOU BUY, I FLY.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.394
NO, MICHAEL, YOU ARE...
MICHAEL, COME BACK HERE.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.937
MICHAEL,

10:51.651 --> 10:56.905
WELCOME TO THE POOL.
I AM YOUR HOST FEZ.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.242
WHAT IS GOING ON?

11:01.410 --> 11:02.744
