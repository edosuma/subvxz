02:45.254 --> 02:46.778
Come on, boys!

02:47.623 --> 02:51.616
The way you're lollygagging around here
with them picks and them shovels...

02:52.061 --> 02:54.689
...you'd think it was 120°...

02:55.297 --> 02:58.391
It cant' be more than 114.

03:01.604 --> 03:04.971
Dock that Chink a day's pay
for napping on the job.

03:07.710 --> 03:12.409
Now, come on, boys, where's your
spirit? I don't hear no singing.

03:13.115 --> 03:16.448
When you were slaves,
you sang like birds.

03:17.086 --> 03:19.646
Go on. How about a good
old nigger work song?

03:28.530 --> 03:32.796
"I get no kick from champagne.

03:35.771 --> 03:40.470
"Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all.

03:42.344 --> 03:45.905
"So tell me why should it be true...

03:47.983 --> 03:51.976
"... that I get a belt out of you?

03:55.691 --> 03:59.354
"Some get a kick from cocaine. "

04:03.198 --> 04:05.462
What the hell is that shit?

04:07.202 --> 04:11.070
I meant a song. A real song.

04:11.540 --> 04:12.700
Something like...

04:13.208 --> 04:17.838
"Swing low, sweet chariot... "

04:20.949 --> 04:22.780
Swing low? Sweet chariot?

04:23.152 --> 04:24.483
Don't know that one, huh?

04:26.355 --> 04:29.017
How about "De Camp Town Ladies"?

04:30.225 --> 04:32.716
"De Camp Town Ladies"?

04:36.065 --> 04:37.157
Ah, you know.

04:38.334 --> 04:42.964
"De Camp Town Ladies sing this song,
doo-dah, doo-dah.

04:43.739 --> 04:47.505
"De Camp Town race track five
miles long, all the doo-dah day!

04:48.077 --> 04:51.672
"Gonna run all night,
gonna run all day.

04:51.980 --> 04:55.677
"Bet my money on the bobtailed
nag, somebody bet on the bay!"

05:05.361 --> 05:09.195
What in the wide, wide world
of sports is going on here?

05:09.465 --> 05:12.093
I hired you people to try to get
a little track laid...

05:12.434 --> 05:15.528
...not to jump around like a
bunch of Kansas City faggots!

05:16.004 --> 05:18.700
Sorry, Mr. Taggart. I, I guess
we kind of got caught up.

05:19.007 --> 05:22.344
Dummy, the surveyors say they may
have run into some quicksand up ahead.

05:22.444 --> 05:23.706
Better check it out.

05:24.279 --> 05:27.112
Okay, I'll send down a team of
horses to check out the ground.

05:27.449 --> 05:32.113
Horses! We can't afford to lose
any horses, you dummy!

05:32.721 --> 05:34.279
Send over a couple of niggers.

05:38.227 --> 05:39.785
You and you.

05:42.231 --> 05:45.462
Sir, he specifically requested
two niggers...

05:46.668 --> 05:50.764
...but to tell a family secret,
my grandmother was Dutch.

05:51.306 --> 05:54.298
Get on that hand car and take it
down to the end of that line!

05:54.643 --> 05:56.110
Just trying to help you out.

05:58.347 --> 06:00.611
I didn't know your grandma was Dutch!

06:04.486 --> 06:09.150
"Oh, de Camp Town Ladies sing
this song, doo-dah, doo-dah.

06:09.992 --> 06:14.486
"Camp Town race track five
miles long, oh, doo-dah day.

06:15.164 --> 06:18.827
"Going to run all night,
going to run all day.

06:19.168 --> 06:23.002
"I waged my money on the bobtail nag,
somebody bet on the bay!"

06:28.177 --> 06:29.166
Am I wrong...

06:30.546 --> 06:33.674
...or is the world rising?

06:33.982 --> 06:37.349
I don't know, but whatever
it is, I hate it.

06:41.089 --> 06:42.283
Let me ask you something.

06:43.192 --> 06:47.856
What is it that's not exactly water,
and it's not exactly earth?

06:49.031 --> 06:50.396
Quicksand!

06:55.504 --> 06:58.473
Oh, shit, quicksand!

06:59.541 --> 07:01.099
Goddang, now we are in trouble!

07:01.844 --> 07:03.175
They're in trouble!

07:05.881 --> 07:07.246
Get your rope there.
Get over there quick.

07:21.497 --> 07:23.021
Dang, that was lucky.

07:23.499 --> 07:26.491
Doggone near lost a $400 hand cart.

07:33.408 --> 07:38.038
Yeah, we can take it right off to the,
just a little bit to the left of that hill.

07:38.914 --> 07:41.906
But we're going to die, Bart.
They're going to leave us here to die!

07:42.751 --> 07:46.152
Take it easy, Charlie.
My foot is on the rail.

07:52.261 --> 07:55.162
Then maybe down that canyon.
I think it's pretty level off there.

07:55.898 --> 07:58.867
We can't swing back to the right
'cause of that hill there.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.431
That looks like the way
we'll have to go from here.

08:02.371 --> 08:05.431
Yes, we'll put her right down
through there over that ridge.

08:10.779 --> 08:12.576
Well, boys, the break is over.

08:12.915 --> 08:15.179
Don't just lay there getting a suntan.

08:15.551 --> 08:17.542
Won't do you any good, anyhow!

08:19.621 --> 08:21.953
Take that shovel and put
her to some good use!

08:30.732 --> 08:31.391
What?

08:31.567 --> 08:33.034
Don't do that now!

08:36.405 --> 08:37.337
I have to.

08:37.639 --> 08:41.472
Send a wire to the main office
and tell them I said... OW!

08:42.811 --> 08:47.475
Send wire, main office,
tell them I said, "Ow". Gotcha.

08:54.623 --> 08:58.059
And right here, Mr. Lamarr, is
where we ran into quicksand.

08:58.860 --> 09:00.418
Quicksand. Splendid.

09:01.496 --> 09:04.488
And so the railroad has got
to go through Rock Ridge.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.994
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge. Splendid.

09:07.803 --> 09:08.997
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

09:09.371 --> 09:11.430
Rock Ridge. Rock Ridge.

09:11.773 --> 09:13.240
Be still, Taggart. Be still.

09:14.176 --> 09:18.510
My mind is aglow with whirling,
transient nodes of thought...

09:18.847 --> 09:22.010
...careening through a
cosmic vapor of invention.

09:22.351 --> 09:23.010
Ditto!

09:25.787 --> 09:29.780
Ditto? Ditto, you provincial putz!

09:30.626 --> 09:31.615
I'm sorry, sir.

09:32.361 --> 09:34.829
A plan. We need a plan.

09:35.831 --> 09:37.458
What in the hell was that?

09:45.407 --> 09:47.034
We can't hear ourselves think!

09:50.846 --> 09:55.510
Sorry, your Worship, but I've got
two men home sick with the flu...

09:55.851 --> 09:58.120
...and it's utter chaos down here.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.518
I'll try to keep it
as quiet as possible.

10:01.223 --> 10:02.850
But as you can see...

10:05.727 --> 10:07.718
...this one is a doozey.

10:09.931 --> 10:13.298
Yes, the Doctor Gillespie killings.
Well, do your best.

10:18.373 --> 10:19.897
Now, let's see. Where were we?

10:20.242 --> 10:21.209
Rock Ridge.

10:23.145 --> 10:26.512
Yes, when that railroad
goes through Rock Ridge...

10:26.848 --> 10:30.011
...that land will be worth
millions, and I want it!

10:30.886 --> 10:35.152
I want that land so badly,
I can taste it.

10:37.926 --> 10:39.860
There must be a way.

10:41.997 --> 10:43.191
Clumsy fool!

10:44.299 --> 10:47.393
Wait a minute! There might
be a legal precedent.

10:47.836 --> 10:52.207
Of course! Land-snatching!

10:52.307 --> 10:55.470
Land. La-land. "See 'Snatch'."

10:58.513 --> 11:02.472
Haley vs. United States.
Haley, seven. United States, nothing.

11:02.818 --> 11:05.548
You see, it can be done.
It can be done.

11:06.321 --> 11:10.314
Unfortunately, there is one thing that
stands between me and that property.

11:10.659 --> 11:11.990
The rightful owners.

11:12.427 --> 11:15.597
There must be some way of scaring
them off, driving them out.

11:15.697 --> 11:18.257
Getting rid of every human being
alive in that...

11:19.668 --> 11:21.158
It's down the hall and to the left.

11:22.904 --> 11:23.768
I've got it!

11:24.072 --> 11:24.834
What? What?

11:25.340 --> 11:28.070
I know how we can run
everybody out of Rock Ridge.

11:28.577 --> 11:32.013
We'll kill the first-born male
child in every household!

11:33.949 --> 11:35.280
Too Jewish.

11:40.589 --> 11:42.682
We'll work up a Number Six on them!

11:42.791 --> 11:44.486
I'm afraid I'm not familiar
with that one.

11:44.593 --> 11:46.857
That's where we go
riding into town...

11:47.195 --> 11:49.026
...and a-whapping and a-whooping
every living thing...

11:49.131 --> 11:51.861
...that moves within an inch
of its life!

11:52.601 --> 11:54.034
Except the women folks, of course.

11:54.369 --> 11:55.358
You spare the women?

11:55.704 --> 11:59.697
No, we rape the shit out of them
at the Number Six dance later on!

12:00.041 --> 12:02.202
That's marvelous! That's so creative!

12:03.545 --> 12:05.103
Why, Taggart, you've been hurt!

12:05.447 --> 12:08.541
That uppity nigger hit me
on the head with a shovel.

12:10.085 --> 12:13.282
I'd sure appreciate it, sir, if
you could find it in your heart...

12:13.622 --> 12:16.614
...to hang him up by his
neck until he was dead.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.448
Got him locked up downstairs.

12:18.794 --> 12:20.955
Consider it done, stout fellow.

12:29.571 --> 12:31.596
I've got a special.
When can you work him in?

12:31.973 --> 12:36.307
I couldn't possibly fit him in
until Monday, sir. I'm booked solid.

12:36.645 --> 12:38.135
Monday. Splendid.

12:44.186 --> 12:46.848
Thank you, sir.
And don't you worry.

12:47.255 --> 12:50.691
We'll make Rock Ridge
think it's a chicken...

12:50.859 --> 12:53.623
...that got caught in a tractor's nuts!

12:58.433 --> 13:02.301
It's all right, Taggart. Just a man
and a horse being hung out there.

13:09.010 --> 13:12.104
"There was a peaceful town
called Rock Ridge,

13:13.682 --> 13:16.446
"... where people lived in harmony.

13:18.453 --> 13:21.513
"They never had no kind of trouble.

13:23.291 --> 13:26.021
"There was no hint of misery.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.801
"The town saloon was always lively...

13:36.338 --> 13:38.806
"... but never nasty or obscene.

13:40.475 --> 13:42.807
"Behind the bar stood Anal Johnson.

13:44.379 --> 13:46.370
"He always kept things nice and clean!

13:49.818 --> 13:51.581
"And all at once the trouble started.

13:52.754 --> 13:54.745
"A pack of murderers and thieves...

13:55.891 --> 13:57.882
"... like swarms of locusts
they descended...

13:59.027 --> 14:01.018
"... their aim to make
the townsfolk flee. "

14:29.891 --> 14:31.381
Well, that's the end of this suit!

14:39.868 --> 14:42.803
Have you ever seen such cruelty?

14:46.207 --> 14:50.200
"Now is a time of great decision.

14:52.881 --> 14:56.874
"Are we to stay or up and quit?

14:59.754 --> 15:03.747
"There's no avoiding this conclusion.

15:07.228 --> 15:11.221
"Our town is turning into shit!"

15:20.141 --> 15:22.132
Well, I don't have to tell you
good folks...

15:22.911 --> 15:25.744
...what has been happening
here in our beloved town.

15:27.148 --> 15:30.914
Sheriff murdered, crops burned...

15:31.419 --> 15:34.946
...stores looted, people stampeded...

15:35.323 --> 15:37.086
...and cattle raped!

15:39.327 --> 15:43.991
Now the time has come to act.
And act fast!

15:47.335 --> 15:48.427
I'm leaving.

15:49.104 --> 15:53.768
You get back here, you old
pious, candy-ass sidewinder!

15:54.509 --> 15:58.172
There ain't no way that nobody
is going to leave this town!

15:59.981 --> 16:03.610
Hell, I was born here
and I was raised here...

16:03.952 --> 16:06.216
...and goddamn it,
I'm going to die here!

16:06.554 --> 16:10.149
And no sidewinder,
bushwhacking, hornswoggling...

16:10.492 --> 16:14.792
...cracker croaker, is going
to ruin my biscuit-cutter!

16:21.503 --> 16:23.403
Now who can argue with that?

16:27.008 --> 16:29.306
I think we're all indebted
to Gabby Johnson...

16:29.711 --> 16:32.544
...for clearly stating
what needed to be said.

16:33.481 --> 16:35.574
I'm particularly glad that
these lovely children...

16:35.750 --> 16:37.411
...were here today to hear that speech.

16:38.053 --> 16:41.216
Not only was it authentic
frontier gibberish...

16:41.990 --> 16:45.323
...it expressed a courage
little seen in this day and age!

16:47.228 --> 16:48.661
What are we made of?

16:49.898 --> 16:52.196
Our fathers came across the prairie...

16:52.667 --> 16:56.330
...fought Indians, fought drought,
fought locusts, fought Dix!

16:56.671 --> 17:00.334
Remember when Richard Dix came in here
and tried to take over this town?

17:01.342 --> 17:03.003
Well, we didn't give up then...

17:03.411 --> 17:07.608
...and by gum, we're not
going to give up now!

17:13.354 --> 17:14.513
Olson Johnson is right!

17:15.423 --> 17:20.087
What kind of people are we, anyhow?
I say we stay and fight it out!

17:21.628 --> 17:25.895
Dr. Samuel Johnson is right about
Olson Johnson's being right.

17:26.233 --> 17:28.134
And I'm not giving up
my ice cream parlor...

17:28.236 --> 17:30.898
...that I built with these two hands
for nothing or nobody!

17:32.574 --> 17:34.201
Howard Johnson is right!

17:37.912 --> 17:42.576
Well, if we're going to stay, and
I think it's a big mistake...

17:44.152 --> 17:48.054
...we're going to need a new sheriff.
Now, who is it going to be?

17:49.124 --> 17:52.252
Why don't we wire the governor
to send us a sheriff?

17:52.594 --> 17:54.824
Why should we get our own men killed?

17:55.296 --> 17:58.732
Howard Johnson is right.
We'll wire the governor.

18:00.168 --> 18:04.468
Then let us pray for the deliverance
of our new sheriff.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.506
Will the congregation please rise?

18:09.177 --> 18:13.841
I shall now read from the books
of Matthew, Mark, Luke...

18:16.417 --> 18:17.406
...and duck!

18:27.662 --> 18:29.653
We've got to do something at once!

18:32.667 --> 18:34.897
Governor, may I disturb
you for a moment, sir?

18:35.470 --> 18:39.236
If you will just sign this, governor.
Right here.

18:39.641 --> 18:40.972
Yes, what the hell is it?

18:41.309 --> 18:42.644
Well, under the provisions
of this bill...

18:42.744 --> 18:45.975
...we would snatch 200,000 acres
of Indian territory...

18:46.381 --> 18:48.316
...which we have deemed unsafe
for their use at this time.

18:48.416 --> 18:50.384
They're such children.

18:50.685 --> 18:53.221
200,000 acres!
200,000 acres!

18:53.321 --> 18:55.380
What will it cost, man?
What will it cost?

18:57.492 --> 18:59.153
A box of these.

18:59.627 --> 19:02.494
Are you crazy? They'll never go
for it, and then again they might.

19:02.830 --> 19:05.424
The little red devils, they
love toys. May I try one?

19:08.670 --> 19:09.932
These things are defective.

19:13.508 --> 19:14.941
Right as usual, sir.

19:16.010 --> 19:16.942
Show-off!

19:17.278 --> 19:19.337
Just sign this, sir. Right here.

19:19.681 --> 19:21.148
Okay, give us a hand here.

19:22.283 --> 19:23.341
Work, work, work.

19:25.153 --> 19:27.519
Hello, boys, have a good night's rest?
I missed you.

19:27.855 --> 19:30.346
Just one more bill for you to sign, sir.

19:30.692 --> 19:31.681
What is this?

19:31.960 --> 19:34.360
This is the bill that will convert
the State Hospital for the Insane...

19:34.696 --> 19:38.132
...into the William J. Le Petomane
Memorial Gambling Casino for the Insane.

19:38.466 --> 19:39.296
Gentlemen, this...

19:39.634 --> 19:41.903
...this bill will be
a giant step forward...

19:42.003 --> 19:44.301
...in the treatment
of the insane gambler.

19:44.806 --> 19:46.296
Yes, bravo! Beautiful.

19:49.577 --> 19:50.805
Thank you, Hedy. Thank you.

19:51.145 --> 19:54.137
It's not Hedy. It's Hedley.
Hedley Lamarr.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.751
What the hell are you worried about?

19:56.851 --> 19:59.149
This is 1874.
You'll be able to sue her.

20:11.032 --> 20:12.363
All right, help me in with this.

20:13.701 --> 20:15.032
Just, ah, think of your secretary.

20:15.536 --> 20:17.367
Ah, that was a very good suggestion.

20:18.740 --> 20:21.174
Okay, is that it? Anything else?

20:21.576 --> 20:23.737
Just this urgent telegram
from Rock Ridge.

20:24.212 --> 20:25.338
It arrived last Friday.

20:26.781 --> 20:27.839
Read it, read it.

20:29.117 --> 20:33.281
"Sheriff murdered. Church meeting
bombed. Reign of terror must cease.

20:33.755 --> 20:35.222
"Send new sheriff immediately. "

20:35.690 --> 20:37.021
Holy underwear!

20:37.925 --> 20:40.917
Sheriff murdered. Innocent women
and children blown to bits!

20:41.729 --> 20:43.665
We've got to protect our
phony-baloney jobs, gentlemen.

20:43.765 --> 20:47.394
We must do something about this
immediately, immediately, immediately!

20:50.571 --> 20:51.936
I didn't get a "hrumph" out of that guy!

20:52.273 --> 20:53.433
Give the governor a "hrumph. "

20:54.609 --> 20:55.701
You watch your ass.

20:56.311 --> 20:58.279
Gentlemen, please, rest your sphincters.

20:58.613 --> 20:59.443
Well put.

21:00.615 --> 21:02.776
As Attorney General, I can assure you...

21:03.051 --> 21:06.578
...that a suitable sheriff will be found
to restore the peace in Rock Ridge.

21:06.921 --> 21:08.252
Meeting is adjourned.

21:08.589 --> 21:11.956
Oh, I am sorry, sir. I didn't mean
to overstep my bounds. You say that.

21:12.293 --> 21:12.952
What?

21:13.294 --> 21:14.124
- Meeting is adjourned.
- It is?

21:14.829 --> 21:16.160
No. You say that, governor.

21:16.531 --> 21:17.799
- What?
- Meeting is adjourned.

21:17.899 --> 21:18.558
It is?

21:18.800 --> 21:21.792
Here, play around with this for a while.
They are sweeping the country.

21:23.304 --> 21:24.999
Why don't you give these out
to some of the boys...

21:25.273 --> 21:27.036
...in lieu of pay? Here you go.

21:29.444 --> 21:31.969
And one for Miss Stein,
my beloved secretary.

21:32.313 --> 21:35.407
Play with these, boys,
in lieu of the other things.

21:36.951 --> 21:38.475
This friggin' thing is warped.

21:40.555 --> 21:42.420
Why do I always get a warped one?

21:45.593 --> 21:49.996
A sheriff! But law and order
is the last thing I want.

21:51.766 --> 21:56.430
Wait a minute. Maybe I could
turn this thing to my advantage.

21:57.438 --> 22:02.102
If I could find a sheriff who so
offends the citizens of Rock Ridge...

22:02.510 --> 22:05.502
...that his very appearance
would drive them out of town...

22:08.216 --> 22:09.843
But where would I find such a man?

22:11.352 --> 22:12.512
Why am I asking you?

22:22.630 --> 22:26.327
Welcome to Hanging House.
Not to worry...

22:26.868 --> 22:28.995
...everyone is equal in my eye.

22:47.054 --> 22:48.749
Oh, not my ear!

22:52.760 --> 22:53.692
Governor!

22:56.130 --> 22:57.324
Official business, sir.

22:57.698 --> 22:58.858
Is it important?

22:59.333 --> 23:00.664
It's very crucial.

23:02.003 --> 23:02.992
Be with you in a minute.

23:03.905 --> 23:05.896
Throw something on
and stay in that position.

23:08.509 --> 23:12.502
Forgive me, I was just, ah, walking
the parapet, taking a look around.

23:12.847 --> 23:13.711
What can I do for you?

23:14.048 --> 23:15.379
Governor, as per your instructions...

23:15.483 --> 23:18.145
...I'd like you to meet
the new sheriff of Rock Ridge.

23:18.853 --> 23:20.377
I'd be delighted... Wow!

23:21.789 --> 23:23.725
I've got to talk to you. Come here.
Have you gone berserk?

23:23.825 --> 23:26.487
Can't you see that man is a nig...

23:30.264 --> 23:33.062
Wrong person. Forgive me.
No offense intended.

23:34.802 --> 23:38.169
Have you gone berserk?
Can't you see that man is a nig?

23:38.673 --> 23:39.970
Don't worry, sir.

23:40.408 --> 23:42.543
Now, Hedley, I've always
trusted your judgment before...

23:42.643 --> 23:44.873
...but haven't you taken a giant leap
away from your good senses?

23:44.979 --> 23:47.277
Please, don't fly off the handle, sir.

23:47.448 --> 23:49.780
I'm about to make you
an historic figure.

23:50.751 --> 23:53.083
Maybe even get you a cabinet post.

23:53.421 --> 23:54.615
A cabinet post!

23:55.256 --> 23:56.120
Did you say that?

23:56.958 --> 23:57.788
Wonderful!

23:58.125 --> 24:02.323
Yes, the first man ever to appoint
a black sheriff! Just think, sir...

24:02.797 --> 24:03.991
...Washington, Jefferson...

24:04.298 --> 24:04.957
...Lincoln.

24:05.299 --> 24:06.391
Le Petomane!

24:07.502 --> 24:09.732
Sir, you have the seeds
of greatness in you.

24:10.238 --> 24:13.139
Nurse them, caress them,
pour water on them.

24:13.774 --> 24:15.833
Don't short-change yourself, sir.

24:16.577 --> 24:19.740
It will never work.
They'll kill him dead in one day!

24:20.081 --> 24:24.313
One day is all we'll need to secure your
name in the annals of Western history.

24:24.652 --> 24:27.212
And to get for you
a nomination for, dare I say...?

24:27.655 --> 24:28.451
Dare, dare!

24:28.789 --> 24:29.813
The Presidency!

24:30.925 --> 24:33.291
Hail to the Chief!
Hail to the Chief!

24:42.103 --> 24:44.264
"Four score and seven years ago...

24:44.605 --> 24:47.733
"... our forefathers
brought forth on this... "

24:48.175 --> 24:49.164
Are you coming back?

24:49.510 --> 24:50.340
In a moment, dear.

24:51.112 --> 24:55.776
Gentlemen, affairs of state must take
precedent over the affairs of state.

24:56.551 --> 24:58.018
Yes, of course, sir, we understand.

24:58.753 --> 24:59.845
Will you make all the arrangements?

25:00.187 --> 25:01.518
I will make all the arrangements.

25:01.789 --> 25:03.188
Especially the funeral.

25:05.059 --> 25:09.325
Good luck, good luck, boys.
Wonderful working with you. Good luck!

26:14.428 --> 26:17.591
Hurry up, get those flags up.
He'll be here soon.

26:18.966 --> 26:21.400
I just got a telegram from
the governor's office.

26:21.669 --> 26:23.330
The sheriff will be here at noon!

26:24.071 --> 26:27.563
Noon! I'd better rehearse my speech!

26:29.644 --> 26:32.977
"As Honorary Chairman of
the Welcoming Committee...

26:33.347 --> 26:37.977
"... it is my privilege to extend to you
a laurel and hearty handshake!"

26:39.987 --> 26:40.715
Wonderful!

26:41.055 --> 26:41.885
Excellent!

26:42.890 --> 26:44.221
Can you see him yet?

26:49.497 --> 26:50.486
The sheriff is coming!

26:51.966 --> 26:54.059
Ring out the church bell!

27:10.251 --> 27:13.084
Hey, the sheriff is a n...

27:14.288 --> 27:15.152
What did he say?

27:15.489 --> 27:16.956
The sheriff is near!

27:17.591 --> 27:22.028
No, no, dag blame it, gol darn
it, the sheriff is a n...

27:43.617 --> 27:46.415
As Chairman of the
Welcoming Committee...

27:46.721 --> 27:51.420
...it is my privilege to extend a laurel
and hearty handshake to our new...

27:55.796 --> 27:56.524
...nigger.

28:25.793 --> 28:28.284
Excuse me while I whip this out.

28:34.034 --> 28:36.696
"By the power vested in me by...

28:36.971 --> 28:40.304
"... the Honorable
William J. Le Petomane...

28:46.247 --> 28:47.475
"... I hereby assume the duties...

28:47.648 --> 28:50.913
"... of the Office of Sheriff in and for
the Township of Rock Ridge. "

28:51.952 --> 28:54.580
Gentlemen, let us not allow anger
to rule the day.

28:55.055 --> 28:57.546
As your spiritual leader,
I implore you...

28:57.892 --> 29:00.258
...to pay heed to this good
book and what it has to say.

29:03.631 --> 29:06.429
Son, you're on your own!

29:11.405 --> 29:12.133
Hold it!

29:12.973 --> 29:15.635
The next man makes a move,
the nigger gets it!

29:20.281 --> 29:22.943
Hold it, men. He's not bluffing.

29:23.284 --> 29:26.151
Listen to him, men.
He's just crazy enough to do it.

29:26.487 --> 29:29.854
Drop it! Or I swear I'll blow this
nigger's head all over this town!

29:31.525 --> 29:36.224
Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate!
Do what he say! Do what he say!

29:53.447 --> 29:56.007
Isn't anybody going to
help that poor man?

29:56.483 --> 29:58.974
Hush, Harriet. That's a
sure way to get him killed.

30:00.754 --> 30:01.880
Help me, help me...

30:03.190 --> 30:04.555
...somebody help me!

30:07.228 --> 30:07.887
Shut up!

30:12.299 --> 30:16.793
Oh, baby, you are so talented.

30:17.338 --> 30:19.499
And they are so dumb!

30:28.015 --> 30:29.004
Goddamn it!

30:29.350 --> 30:30.578
I said, "Order"!

30:31.919 --> 30:36.583
You know, Nietzsche says,
"Out of chaos comes order. "

30:37.191 --> 30:38.886
Oh, blow it out your ass, Howard!

30:41.829 --> 30:43.820
Now everyone be quiet...

30:44.698 --> 30:49.362
...whilst we listen to Harriet van
Johnson, our esteemed schoolmarm...

30:51.205 --> 30:55.869
...as she reads a telegram that she
herself has composed to the governor...

30:57.511 --> 31:02.175
...expressing our feelings
about the new sheriff.

31:10.257 --> 31:12.248
"To the Honorable William J.
Le Petomane, Governor. "

31:12.593 --> 31:14.083
Louder! Speak up! We can't hear you!

31:16.130 --> 31:17.961
I'm not used to public speaking.

31:20.267 --> 31:24.931
"We, the white, God-fearing
citizens of Rock Ridge...

31:26.273 --> 31:30.141
"... wish to express
our extreme displeasure...

31:30.477 --> 31:32.468
"... with your choice of sheriff.

31:33.147 --> 31:36.082
"Please remove him immediately.

31:38.385 --> 31:41.718
"The fact that you
have sent him here... "

31:42.556 --> 31:47.220
"... just goes to prove that you are
the leading asshole in the state. "

32:11.485 --> 32:13.953
The drunk in number two must be awake.

32:19.693 --> 32:21.126
Are we awake?

32:25.666 --> 32:27.156
We're not sure.

32:28.602 --> 32:30.900
Are we black?

32:31.305 --> 32:32.294
Yes, we are.

32:34.341 --> 32:38.471
Then we're awake.
But we're very puzzled.

32:40.481 --> 32:43.279
I think I better straighten myself out.

32:46.820 --> 32:47.912
Need any help?

32:51.225 --> 32:52.556
All I can get.

33:04.872 --> 33:06.965
That's okay. Sit down over here.

33:18.218 --> 33:20.209
Hey, maybe you should
eat something first.

33:20.754 --> 33:23.552
No, thanks. Food makes me sick.

33:33.200 --> 33:37.466
A man drinks like that and doesn't eat,
he is going to die.

33:40.174 --> 33:40.970
When?

33:44.344 --> 33:45.208
What's your name?

33:45.779 --> 33:49.374
Well, my name is Jim,
but most people call me...

33:52.419 --> 33:53.181
...Jim.

33:55.856 --> 33:59.792
Okay, Jim, since you are my
guest and I am your host...

34:00.127 --> 34:02.891
...what is your pleasure?
What do you like to do?

34:03.697 --> 34:06.359
Oh, I don't know. Play chess...

34:08.435 --> 34:09.493
...screw.

34:10.871 --> 34:12.202
Well, let's play chess.

34:16.243 --> 34:17.005
Checkmate.

34:20.147 --> 34:20.909
Checkmate.

34:21.581 --> 34:24.016
Why, you devious son-of-a-bitch!

34:24.885 --> 34:26.011
Happy days!

34:35.795 --> 34:37.559
Man, why do you do that to yourself?

34:38.899 --> 34:41.060
Oh, you don't really want to know that.

34:41.635 --> 34:42.533
I do, I do!

34:43.070 --> 34:44.661
Well, if you must pry.

34:45.038 --> 34:46.164
I must, I must!

34:47.774 --> 34:50.436
I don't know if you ever
heard of me before, but...

34:51.344 --> 34:55.543
...I used to be called the Waco Kid.

34:57.117 --> 35:00.848
The Waco Kid. He had the
fastest hands in the West!

35:02.623 --> 35:03.851
In the world!

35:04.958 --> 35:07.119
Well, if you're the Kid,
then show me something.

35:08.862 --> 35:13.561
Maybe a couple of years ago I could
have shown you something, but today...

35:16.103 --> 35:17.195
...look at that.

35:17.571 --> 35:18.868
Steady as a rock.

35:19.473 --> 35:21.566
Yes, but I shoot with this hand.

35:22.609 --> 35:26.773
See, I knew you weren't the Waco Kid.
You were just pulling my lariat.

35:42.996 --> 35:43.894
See that king?

35:45.699 --> 35:47.599
Put your hands on both sides of it.

35:51.605 --> 35:55.097
Now when I say, "go,"
you try to grab it first.

35:55.976 --> 35:58.911
Man, that's no contest.
You're a mile away.

36:03.116 --> 36:07.610
Anyway, when you hear the word
"go," you just try to grab it.

36:09.022 --> 36:09.681
Ready?

36:30.744 --> 36:32.075
You looking for this?

36:36.917 --> 36:41.217
Well, raise my rent!
You are the Kid!

36:41.555 --> 36:44.581
Was. Yeah, I was the Kid.

36:47.527 --> 36:48.459
What happened?

36:49.896 --> 36:52.232
Well, it got so that every
piss-ant prairie punk...

36:52.332 --> 36:54.562
...who thought he could
shoot a gun...

36:54.801 --> 36:57.668
...would ride into town
to try out the Waco Kid.

37:00.607 --> 37:03.906
I must have killed more men
than Cecil B. DeMille.

37:05.312 --> 37:06.574
It got pretty gritty.

37:07.447 --> 37:10.109
I started to hear the
word "draw" in my sleep.

37:13.053 --> 37:14.111
Then one day...

37:15.088 --> 37:19.752
...I was just walking down the street
and I heard a voice behind me say...

37:21.795 --> 37:25.492
..."Reach for it, mister!"
I spun around.

37:28.068 --> 37:30.263
And there I was face to face...

37:32.739 --> 37:35.401
...with a 6-year-old kid!

37:39.846 --> 37:43.213
Well, I just threw my guns
down and walked away.

37:46.486 --> 37:49.319
The little bastard shot me in the ass!

37:52.225 --> 37:56.855
So I limped to the nearest saloon,
crawled inside a whiskey bottle...

37:59.466 --> 38:01.161
...and I've been there ever since.

38:05.806 --> 38:06.534
Have a drink.

38:13.714 --> 38:18.378
Anyway, that's all ancient history.
Now you tell me your story.

38:18.752 --> 38:23.018
What's a dazzling urbanite like you
doing in a rustic setting like this?

38:24.324 --> 38:25.655
If you really must pry.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.184
I must, I must!

38:33.033 --> 38:35.695
Well, back in '56...

38:36.169 --> 38:39.832
...my folks and I were part
of this long wagon train...

38:40.407 --> 38:41.396
...moving West.

38:54.888 --> 38:57.220
Well, not exactly part of it.

38:58.191 --> 39:02.287
You might say we were bringing up
the rear, when suddenly,

39:02.696 --> 39:06.257
...from out of the West,
came the entire Sioux Nation!

39:06.600 --> 39:10.536
And let me tell you, baby,
they were open for business!

39:14.641 --> 39:18.441
Naturally, the white folks
didn't let us travel in their circle...

39:18.912 --> 39:19.970
...so we made our own.

39:56.616 --> 39:58.083
Shvartzes?

40:06.259 --> 40:09.023
Luzem gayen!

40:13.800 --> 40:15.631
Cop a walk. It's all right.

40:15.869 --> 40:16.699
Thank you.

40:18.805 --> 40:21.035
Abi gezunt. Take off.

40:29.616 --> 40:31.880
They're darker than us!

40:35.388 --> 40:37.652
And the rest is history.

40:39.493 --> 40:40.653
Impressed?

40:46.166 --> 40:49.033
Always like to keep my audience riveted.

41:42.956 --> 41:44.514
How about some more beans,
Mr. Taggart?

41:44.858 --> 41:46.621
I'd say you've had enough!

41:50.597 --> 41:54.863
I understand there's a new sheriff
in town. Who wants to kill him?

42:01.541 --> 42:04.942
Why don't we give him to Mongo?

42:08.815 --> 42:10.806
Holy shit, that's too cruel!

42:11.918 --> 42:15.081
I'll be danged! That is a unique idea!

42:23.296 --> 42:25.730
Down, boy, down, boy,
down, Mongo!

42:26.499 --> 42:27.659
Hey, it's me. Taggart.

42:28.635 --> 42:29.829
Here, smell. Smell.

42:33.773 --> 42:35.604
That's a good Mongo.

42:36.943 --> 42:41.004
Hey, how about it? How would you
like to mutilate that new sheriff?

42:46.519 --> 42:47.679
Have a cigar.

43:28.561 --> 43:30.688
Oh, by the way,
I got a note this morning.

43:31.064 --> 43:31.894
From who?

43:32.232 --> 43:36.396
Well, I'm not sure.
It was addressed to the Deputy Spade.

43:40.674 --> 43:43.507
Well, once I establish
myself in this town...

43:43.843 --> 43:47.176
...Deputy Spade might turn
out to be a groovy position.

43:57.323 --> 44:00.349
Listen, Bart,
I want you to do me a favor.

44:01.594 --> 44:03.528
I don't want you going
out there this morning.

44:03.897 --> 44:06.161
You can't win these people
over, no matter what you do.

44:06.533 --> 44:08.091
They're just not going to accept you.

44:18.778 --> 44:21.770
I'm glad those fingers ain't loaded!

44:25.452 --> 44:27.079
Just like old times.

44:31.391 --> 44:36.055
Like I told you, once you establish
yourself, they've got to accept you.

44:37.564 --> 44:38.553
Catch you later.

44:43.603 --> 44:44.297
Good luck.

44:52.946 --> 44:53.935
Ah, good morning, ma'am.

44:55.815 --> 44:57.806
And isn't it a lovely morning?

44:58.651 --> 45:00.084
Up yours, nigger!

45:04.758 --> 45:07.818
What did you expect?
"Welcome, sonny. "

45:09.095 --> 45:10.494
"Make yourself at home. "

45:11.998 --> 45:16.662
"Marry my daughter. " You've got to
remember these are just simple farmers.

45:18.004 --> 45:20.336
These are people of the land.

45:21.341 --> 45:24.572
The common clay of the new West.

45:26.312 --> 45:27.336
You know.

45:29.516 --> 45:30.505
Morons!

45:34.988 --> 45:36.319
What the hell is that?

45:51.704 --> 45:54.696
Mongo! Santa María!

45:57.110 --> 45:59.010
I believe in it.
And if any one of you...

45:59.179 --> 46:00.771
...friends and neighbors,
kind of gather around and...

46:01.381 --> 46:03.315
Holy shit!

46:08.488 --> 46:13.187
And they say that now in Paris,
France, even as we speak...

46:14.194 --> 46:17.527
...Louis Pasteur has devised
a new vaccine...

46:17.697 --> 46:20.530
...that will obliterate anthrax
once and for all.

46:26.339 --> 46:28.705
Hey, you can't park
that animal over there!

46:29.075 --> 46:30.167
It's illegal.

46:37.917 --> 46:42.411
Think of it, gentlemen. Hoof-and-
mouth disease a thing of the past!

46:43.223 --> 46:46.659
Never mind that shit,
here comes Mongo!

46:52.932 --> 46:54.263
I don't know what it is.

47:01.407 --> 47:03.343
Sheriff, Mongo's back!
He's breaking up the whole town!

47:03.443 --> 47:05.311
You've got to help us, please!

47:05.411 --> 47:07.709
Did you hear that? Now it's "please. "

47:08.047 --> 47:12.507
This morning I couldn't get the time
of day. Who is this Mongo, anyway?

47:12.852 --> 47:15.878
Well, Mongo ain't exactly a "who. "
He's more of a "what. "

47:16.356 --> 47:17.254
What he said.

47:17.590 --> 47:18.682
Well, I don't know...

47:19.259 --> 47:21.557
Oh, thank you very much!

47:23.796 --> 47:25.024
The fool's going to...

47:25.932 --> 47:27.866
I mean, the sheriff's going to do it.

47:33.873 --> 47:38.139
No, no, don't do that! If you shoot
him, you'll just make him mad.

47:49.589 --> 47:50.920
Candygram for Mongo!

48:04.237 --> 48:04.896
Me, Mongo.

48:05.338 --> 48:06.498
Sign, please.

48:17.450 --> 48:19.077
Mongo like candy.

48:26.259 --> 48:28.250
A little further down, to the right.

48:29.028 --> 48:31.564
I thought sure that Mongo
would mash him up...

48:31.664 --> 48:33.655
...into little bitty sheriff meatballs.

48:34.367 --> 48:35.766
I just don't understand it.

48:36.102 --> 48:37.262
Be still, Taggart.

48:38.304 --> 48:40.932
My mind is a raging torrent...

48:41.274 --> 48:43.174
...flooded with rivulets of thought...

48:43.276 --> 48:46.609
...cascading into a waterfall
of creative alternatives.

48:47.947 --> 48:50.040
Gol darn it, Mr. Lamarr...

48:50.416 --> 48:53.817
...you use your tongue prettier
than a $20 whore.

48:59.092 --> 49:01.754
Wait a minute, that's it!

49:03.896 --> 49:05.193
And it will work!

49:05.565 --> 49:08.056
You bet it will! What will work?

49:08.501 --> 49:09.991
Elementary, cactus-head!

49:10.336 --> 49:11.667
The beast has failed.

49:11.804 --> 49:14.671
And when the beast fails,
it's time to call in beauty.

49:16.976 --> 49:17.635
Beauty?

49:20.079 --> 49:23.310
She's never failed me before.
She'll turn him into jelly!

49:23.649 --> 49:25.640
She'll bring him to his knees!

49:28.187 --> 49:31.122
Where's my froggie?
Where's my froggie?

49:31.457 --> 49:33.584
I don't know.
I didn't see it when I came in.

49:33.926 --> 49:35.450
Damn your eyes, look for it!

49:43.536 --> 49:44.468
Oh, there it is.

49:50.243 --> 49:54.942
That was a close one! Daddy loves
Froggie. Froggie love Daddy?

50:05.124 --> 50:06.682
I don't know how you did it.

50:07.193 --> 50:08.490
He was nothing.

50:08.828 --> 50:11.331
The bitch was inventing
the candygram.

50:11.431 --> 50:13.922
They probably won't give me
credit for it.

50:23.242 --> 50:24.709
Good evening, sheriff.

50:25.044 --> 50:27.478
Sorry about the "Up yours, nigger. "

50:27.780 --> 50:31.546
I hope this apple pie will in some
small way say thank you for your...

50:31.884 --> 50:35.547
...ingenuity and courage in
defeating that horrible Mongo.

50:36.055 --> 50:38.546
Thank you. Much obliged.
Good night.

50:48.734 --> 50:52.795
Of course, you'll have the good taste
not to mention that I spoke to you.

50:58.311 --> 51:02.748
I'm rapidly becoming a big
underground success in this town.

51:03.082 --> 51:06.916
See, in another 25 years you'll be able
to shake their hands in broad daylight.

51:07.286 --> 51:09.754
Well, I'm not going to
hold my breath for it.

51:10.123 --> 51:14.526
Come on, I don't want to be late.
Lili von Shtupp is opening tonight.

51:15.261 --> 51:16.592
Lili von who?

51:31.444 --> 51:35.540
Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome.
Come on in.

51:40.620 --> 51:43.054
It's Hedley. For you, my dear.

51:44.490 --> 51:47.425
Oh, how ordinary.

51:51.264 --> 51:54.131
Oh, Lili, Lili, Lili, legs, Lili, Lili!

51:55.801 --> 51:58.793
I can't find the words to
truly express my joy...

51:59.005 --> 52:01.064
...at the rekindling of our association.

52:01.841 --> 52:04.469
Bullshit, what's the job?

52:06.812 --> 52:08.473
I love it when you talk dirty.

52:21.093 --> 52:23.891
Come on, Lamarr, let's get down to
bwass tacks.

52:24.030 --> 52:26.191
What do you want me to do?

52:27.800 --> 52:31.702
I want you to seduce and abandon
the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

52:32.305 --> 52:33.465
You think you can do it?

52:36.209 --> 52:37.676
Is Bismark a hewwing?

52:38.044 --> 52:41.172
Oh, Lili, you're magnificent! Kiss me!

52:53.426 --> 52:57.988
And now, folks, the gal
you've all been waiting for...

52:58.431 --> 53:03.130
...the Bavarian Bombshell herself!
Let's hear it for Lili von Shtupp!

53:16.215 --> 53:19.548
"Here I stand, the goddess of desire...

53:20.219 --> 53:24.155
"... set men on fire.
I have this power.

53:25.958 --> 53:29.416
"Morning, noon and night,
it's drink and dancing...

53:29.929 --> 53:34.593
"... some quick romancing,
and then a shower.

53:35.735 --> 53:39.227
"Stage door Johnnies
constantly surround me...

53:39.572 --> 53:43.064
"... they always hound
me with one request.

53:45.177 --> 53:48.271
"Who can satisfy their lustful habit?

53:49.181 --> 53:53.845
"I'm not a rabbit. I need some rest.

54:01.794 --> 54:03.386
"I'm tired...

54:04.864 --> 54:08.061
"... sick and tired of love...

54:09.769 --> 54:12.260
"I've had my fill of love...

54:14.140 --> 54:16.938
"... from below and above.

54:20.479 --> 54:25.143
"Tired, tired of being admired...

54:27.286 --> 54:30.278
"... tired of love uninspired.

54:32.258 --> 54:34.488
"Let's face it, I'm tired.

54:36.829 --> 54:41.493
"I've been with thousands
of men again and again.

54:42.668 --> 54:44.829
"They promise the moon.

54:45.738 --> 54:50.402
"They're always coming and
going and going and coming...

54:52.545 --> 54:54.536
"... and always too soon. "

54:55.481 --> 54:56.812
Right, girls?

54:57.249 --> 55:01.913
"I'm tired.
Tired of playing the game.

55:04.256 --> 55:07.555
"Ain't it a crying shame?

55:08.661 --> 55:11.653
"I'm so tired. "

55:12.365 --> 55:14.663
Goddamn it, I'm exhausted!

55:16.936 --> 55:19.336
Hello, cowboy, what's your name?

55:20.473 --> 55:23.374
"Tex ma'am"? Tell me, Tex ma'am...

55:23.709 --> 55:25.142
...are you in show business?

55:25.478 --> 55:26.137
Nope.

55:26.379 --> 55:29.348
Well, then, why don't you get your
friggin' feet off the stage?

55:43.229 --> 55:47.893
Hello, handsome. Is that a 10-gallon
hat, or are you just enjoying the show?

55:56.876 --> 55:59.811
Oh, Miss Lili, oh, my lovely lady!

56:11.724 --> 56:14.625
"Tired of playing the game.

56:16.128 --> 56:19.723
"Ain't it a crying shame...

56:20.399 --> 56:22.390
"... I'm so tired.

56:30.743 --> 56:31.732
"She's tired.

56:32.611 --> 56:35.102
"Sick and tired of love.
Give her a break.

56:35.448 --> 56:38.440
"She's had her fill of love.
She's not a snake!

56:38.751 --> 56:41.743
"From below and above.
Can't you see she's sick?

56:42.922 --> 56:43.911
"She's bushed.

56:44.256 --> 56:46.588
"Tired of being admired.
Let her alone.

"Tired of love uninspired.

"They start with Byron and Shelley...

57:26.065 --> 57:27.396
"I'm so... "

57:28.200 --> 57:32.899
Let's face it. Everything
below the waist is kaput!

58:08.173 --> 58:09.299
What does it say?

58:10.142 --> 58:14.602
"I must see you alone in my dwessing
woom right after the show. "

58:29.762 --> 58:32.094
Wie gehts, meine schatzie?

58:33.065 --> 58:34.123
Faw out!

58:39.271 --> 58:42.604
A wed wose. How womantic!

58:44.043 --> 58:45.704
Have a seat, shewiff.

58:51.717 --> 58:53.275
Won't you excuse me for a moment...

58:53.452 --> 58:56.444
...while I slip into something
a little bit more comfortable?

58:59.792 --> 59:01.225
Bitte, baby.

59:08.734 --> 59:11.794
Why don't you loosen your bullets?

59:18.110 --> 59:20.670
Ahh, I feel wefweshed!

59:21.614 --> 59:23.605
Isn't it bwight in here?

59:30.022 --> 59:32.923
There! Isn't that better?

59:35.260 --> 59:37.353
Pardon me, I'll be back in a moment.

59:41.433 --> 59:42.297
How is it going?

59:42.635 --> 59:47.038
He's like wet sauerkraut in my hands.
By morning he will be my slave.

59:47.373 --> 59:48.135
Splendid.

59:48.674 --> 59:50.164
Oh, just let me have a little feel.

59:51.610 --> 59:53.840
Where were we? Where are you?

59:55.948 --> 59:58.109
Let me sit down next to you.

01:00:00.619 --> 01:00:01.950
Tell me, schatzie...

01:00:02.855 --> 01:00:07.292
...is it, ah, twu what they say
about the way you people are gifted?

01:00:09.828 --> 01:00:12.991
Oh, it's twu, it's twu!

01:00:19.204 --> 01:00:21.297
Vill you care for
another schnitzengruben?

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.701
No, thank you. Fifteen is my
limit on schnitzengruben.

01:00:26.545 --> 01:00:29.139
Well, then, how about a little...?

01:00:32.651 --> 01:00:35.984
Baby, please, I am not from Havana.

01:00:36.922 --> 01:00:38.253
Excuse me, honey...

01:00:38.724 --> 01:00:42.490
...besides, I'm late for work.
I've got some heavy chores to do.

01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:45.757
Vill I, vill I see you later?

01:00:46.699 --> 01:00:51.033
That all depends on how much
Vitamin E I can get my hands on.

01:00:51.336 --> 01:00:52.564
Nein, nein, achtung!

01:00:53.338 --> 01:00:56.068
No, no, you mustn't go! I need you!

01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:59.233
I never met nobody like you!
I can't live without you!

01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:06.074
Please, you're making
a German spectacle of yourself.

01:01:08.587 --> 01:01:10.248
Auf wiedersehen, baby.

01:01:17.529 --> 01:01:19.588
Oh, what a nice guy.

01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:31.106
Oh, deary, dear.
Look what the cat dragged in.

01:01:44.389 --> 01:01:46.220
What's happening in the clean world?

01:01:47.092 --> 01:01:48.059
Bad news.

01:01:48.761 --> 01:01:53.130
I've got a writ here for Mongo's
release signed by Hedley Lamarr himself.

01:01:58.036 --> 01:02:01.233
Why would a dude like
Hedley Lamarr care about Mongo?

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:05.139
It's legal.

01:02:08.013 --> 01:02:11.414
Oh, those schnitzengrubens
can wipe you out!

01:02:18.957 --> 01:02:20.288
Wake up time!

01:02:26.598 --> 01:02:29.260
Okay, Mongo. You're free to go.

01:02:30.969 --> 01:02:32.027
Mongo no go.

01:02:34.873 --> 01:02:38.365
Oh, come on, Mongo.
You're a free man.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:44.843
Mongo stay with Sheriff Bart.
Sheriff first man ever whip Mongo.

01:02:46.652 --> 01:02:50.554
Mongo impressed, have deep
feelings for Sheriff Bart.

01:02:52.724 --> 01:02:54.885
Oh, you better watch out, big fella.

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:58.190
I think Mongo's taken
a little fancy to you.

01:03:02.668 --> 01:03:03.862
Mongo straight.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.009
Maybe you know why a high-roller...

01:03:11.109 --> 01:03:13.407
...like Hedley Lamarr is interested
in Rock Ridge.

01:03:14.246 --> 01:03:18.478
Don't know. Got to do
with where choo-choo go.

01:03:21.987 --> 01:03:26.048
Mongo, why would Hedley Lamarr care
about where the choo-choo goes?

01:03:27.025 --> 01:03:28.151
Don't know.

01:03:30.062 --> 01:03:34.260
Mongo only pawn in game of life.

01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:39.560
I think this might be a good time
to mosey out...

01:03:39.738 --> 01:03:42.070
...to where they're building
the railroad...

01:03:42.341 --> 01:03:44.002
...and maybe do a little snooping.

01:04:23.649 --> 01:04:25.708
Damn, damn, damn!

01:04:32.324 --> 01:04:35.487
Hey, how are you doing Bart?
Get down off that horse!

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.569
Oh, you shifty nigger!
They said you were hung!

01:04:44.903 --> 01:04:45.961
And they were right!

01:04:46.305 --> 01:04:49.240
Look at that star, hoo-ee!
Civil service!

01:04:52.978 --> 01:04:54.468
Wait. Back off, scamp.

01:04:54.646 --> 01:04:57.638
You are addressing the duly appointed
sheriff of Rock Ridge.

01:04:58.583 --> 01:05:01.450
Rock Ridge? Hey, the railroad
is going through there!

01:05:17.469 --> 01:05:20.870
Back up off your brother!
Don't mess up your brother!

01:05:38.457 --> 01:05:40.288
Holy mother of pearl!

01:05:41.159 --> 01:05:44.185
It's that nigger that hit me
on the head with the shovel!

01:05:44.963 --> 01:05:48.364
Now what the hell do you think you're
doing with that tin star, boy?

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:53.364
Watch that "boy" shit, redneck! You're
talking to the sheriff of Rock Ridge.

01:05:55.907 --> 01:05:57.499
Well, now if that don't beat all!

01:05:58.343 --> 01:06:00.612
Here we take the good time
and trouble...

01:06:00.712 --> 01:06:03.044
...to slaughter every last Indian
in the West, and for what?

01:06:04.816 --> 01:06:08.980
So they can appoint a sheriff
that's blacker than any Indian!

01:06:10.155 --> 01:06:11.554
I am depressed.

01:06:12.024 --> 01:06:15.425
Excuse me, Mr. Taggart, sir, but I
sure do hate to see you like this.

01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:18.363
What if me and the boys were to
shoot that nigger dead?

01:06:18.463 --> 01:06:20.499
Would that pep you up some?

01:06:20.599 --> 01:06:21.691
Well, it might help.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.762
All right, boys. On the count of three.

01:06:25.504 --> 01:06:27.836
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.401
Don't pay no attention to that alky.

01:06:30.575 --> 01:06:32.907
He can't even hold a gun,
much less shoot it.

01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:37.844
Like I said. On the count of three.

01:06:40.252 --> 01:06:40.911
One...

01:06:43.221 --> 01:06:43.880
...two...

01:06:44.756 --> 01:06:45.415
...three!

01:06:57.202 --> 01:07:01.866
Well, just don't sit there looking
stupid, grasping your hands in pain.

01:07:02.707 --> 01:07:06.268
How about a little applause
for the Waco Kid?

01:07:17.389 --> 01:07:20.125
All right, I'm through being
Mr. Goodbar!

01:07:20.225 --> 01:07:23.023
The time has come to act
and act quickly!

01:07:23.161 --> 01:07:24.492
All my plans have backfired!

01:07:24.596 --> 01:07:26.928
Instead of the people leaving,
they're staying in droves!

01:07:27.265 --> 01:07:31.292
Vhy don't you admit it?
He's too much of man for you. I know.

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.501
You going to need an army to beat him!

01:07:34.072 --> 01:07:35.562
You're finished.

01:07:35.907 --> 01:07:40.571
Fertig! Fahrblunged! Fahrcocked!

01:07:47.052 --> 01:07:49.714
Shut up! You Teutonic twat!

01:07:51.123 --> 01:07:52.818
I must think.

01:08:01.399 --> 01:08:05.699
Wait a minute. She said army.
Of course!

01:08:06.304 --> 01:08:10.968
An army of the worst dregs ever
to soil the face of the West!

01:08:14.646 --> 01:08:18.979
I've decided to launch an attack that
will reduce Rock Ridge to ashes!

01:08:19.651 --> 01:08:20.982
What do you want me to do, sir?

01:08:21.419 --> 01:08:24.752
I want you to round up every vicious
criminal and gunslinger in the West.

01:08:24.856 --> 01:08:25.845
Take this down.

01:08:27.058 --> 01:08:31.461
I want rustlers, cutthroats,
murderers, bounty hunters...

01:08:31.796 --> 01:08:36.062
...desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs,
nitwits, half-wits, dimwits...

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:40.964
...vipers, snipers, con men,
Indian agents, Mexican bandits...

01:08:41.305 --> 01:08:44.571
...muggers, buggerers,
bushwackers, hornswagglers...

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:48.743
...horse thieves, bull dykes, train
robbers, bank robbers, ass kickers...

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.279
...shit kickers and Methodists!

01:08:53.852 --> 01:08:55.683
Could you repeat that, sir?

01:09:05.497 --> 01:09:06.828
Where's everybody going?

01:09:08.832 --> 01:09:09.595
Read this.

01:09:20.312 --> 01:09:23.872
Well, can't you see that's the
last act of a desperate man?

01:09:24.515 --> 01:09:29.180
We don't care if it's the First Act of
Henry the Fifth! We're leaving!

01:09:30.287 --> 01:09:33.849
Now, wait a minute!
Wait just one doggoned minute!

01:09:35.126 --> 01:09:39.790
Just give me 24 hours to come up
with a brilliant idea to save our town.

01:09:40.365 --> 01:09:43.232
Just 24 hours, that's all I ask.

01:09:43.734 --> 01:09:44.827
No!

01:09:45.904 --> 01:09:47.837
You'd do it for Randolph Scott.

01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:56.446
All right, sheriff. 24 hours.

01:10:57.008 --> 01:10:57.702
Next!

01:10:59.244 --> 01:11:00.211
Qualifications?

01:11:00.745 --> 01:11:03.009
Rape, murder, arson and rape.

01:11:03.715 --> 01:11:05.012
You said rape twice.

01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:06.939
I like rape.

01:11:09.721 --> 01:11:12.121
Charming. Sign right here.

01:11:13.591 --> 01:11:14.922
Take that badge.

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.962
Qualifications?

01:11:20.665 --> 01:11:23.793
Arson, armed robbery, mayhem.

01:11:24.169 --> 01:11:27.661
Wait a moment. What have
you got in your mouth?

01:11:30.775 --> 01:11:32.970
Nothing, eh? Lyle.

01:11:36.247 --> 01:11:37.009
Gum!

01:11:37.749 --> 01:11:40.309
Chewing gum on line, eh?

01:11:40.752 --> 01:11:43.550
I hope you brought enough
for everybody.

01:11:45.457 --> 01:11:47.288
I didn't know there was
going to be so many.

01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:54.822
Boy, is he strict!

01:11:55.333 --> 01:11:58.063
We've got to get in there close
and find out what's happening.

01:11:59.938 --> 01:12:01.064
There's our ticket!

01:12:08.346 --> 01:12:09.438
Hey, boys!

01:12:11.082 --> 01:12:12.515
Look what I've got there!

01:12:14.686 --> 01:12:16.483
Hey, where are the white women at?

01:12:31.069 --> 01:12:32.832
Man, that was pretty! I liked that.

01:12:34.005 --> 01:12:37.805
Be ready to attack Rock Ridge at
noon tomorrow. Here's your badge.

01:12:41.613 --> 01:12:44.411
We don't need no stinkin' badges!

01:12:46.551 --> 01:12:47.210
Next!

01:12:47.886 --> 01:12:48.716
Qualifications?

01:12:49.487 --> 01:12:50.886
Stampeding cattle.

01:12:51.356 --> 01:12:52.846
That's not much of a crime.

01:12:53.191 --> 01:12:54.522
Through the Vatican!

01:12:55.026 --> 01:12:56.015
Kinky!

01:12:59.397 --> 01:13:01.666
Why, Rhett, how many times
have I told you...

01:13:01.766 --> 01:13:04.064
...to wash up after
weekly cross-burning?

01:13:04.702 --> 01:13:05.828
See, it's coming off.

01:13:08.506 --> 01:13:11.998
And now, for my next impression,
Jesse Owens!

01:13:13.778 --> 01:13:15.040
Catch them!

01:13:16.014 --> 01:13:20.417
Hold up, men,
we'll head them off at the pass!

01:13:21.719 --> 01:13:26.053
Head them off at the pass?
I hate that cliché!

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:45.600
Say, "hello. "

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.872
Hello.

01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:49.846
Listen to me, and listen to me good.

01:13:49.981 --> 01:13:52.313
I want you to get
all the brothers together...

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:56.609
...round up all the lumber, canvas, paint
and nails you can lay your hands on...

01:13:56.955 --> 01:14:01.619
...and meet me tonight 3 miles
due east of Rock Ridge at midnight.

01:14:02.427 --> 01:14:03.189
You understand?

01:14:03.895 --> 01:14:04.759
Say, "goodbye. "

01:14:06.564 --> 01:14:07.758
Thanks a lot, brother.

01:14:36.794 --> 01:14:39.864
All right, folks, I know you're a bit
confused wondering what you're doing...

01:14:39.964 --> 01:14:42.194
...out in the middle of the prairie
in the middle of the night.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:43.459
You bet your ass!

01:14:44.702 --> 01:14:45.669
I'm hip.

01:14:46.337 --> 01:14:47.929
Now, before the sun comes up...

01:14:48.239 --> 01:14:54.007
...we're going to build on this sight an
exact replica of the town of Rock Ridge.

01:14:57.015 --> 01:15:00.507
Every building, every storefront,
every rock and every tree...

01:15:00.852 --> 01:15:04.253
...right down to the orange roof
on Howard Johnson's outhouse.

01:15:05.857 --> 01:15:06.846
I get it!

01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:09.921
And tomorrow when Hedley Lamarr
and his men come riding in...

01:15:10.061 --> 01:15:11.255
...to destroy the real Rock Ridge...

01:15:11.396 --> 01:15:13.364
...they'll actually be destroying
the fake Rock Ridge!

01:15:13.464 --> 01:15:15.867
But they'll think
it's the real Rock Ridge!

01:15:15.967 --> 01:15:17.867
But we'll know it's the fake Rock Ridge!

01:15:18.202 --> 01:15:21.535
How're we going to do it? We don't
have the time nor the people.

01:15:21.873 --> 01:15:24.137
Wrong! There's why.

01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:28.911
Who the hell are they?

01:15:32.784 --> 01:15:37.483
Railroad workers. They've agreed
to help us make our dream come true.

01:15:37.989 --> 01:15:40.457
And all they ask in return
is a little plot of land...

01:15:40.592 --> 01:15:42.583
...they can call their own to homestead.

01:15:42.927 --> 01:15:44.053
What do you say?

01:15:51.502 --> 01:15:55.029
We'll give some land to the niggers
and the chinks...

01:15:55.673 --> 01:15:57.868
...but we don't want the Irish!

01:16:03.314 --> 01:16:04.406
No deal.

01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:09.011
Ah, prairie shit! Everybody!

01:16:13.825 --> 01:16:14.792
Oh, Lord...

01:16:16.027 --> 01:16:20.691
...do we have the strength to carry on
this mighty task in one night?

01:16:23.434 --> 01:16:25.766
Or are we just jerking off?

01:16:36.514 --> 01:16:41.178
Okay, okay, we have done it.
Now, let's see what we have done.

01:17:21.459 --> 01:17:26.123
Men, you are about to embark
on a great crusade...

01:17:27.131 --> 01:17:29.622
...to stamp out runaway
decency in the West.

01:17:30.334 --> 01:17:32.564
Now you will only
be risking your lives...

01:17:33.004 --> 01:17:37.566
...whilst I will be risking an almost
certain Academy Award nomination...

01:17:38.743 --> 01:17:40.176
...for Best Supporting Actor.

01:17:41.079 --> 01:17:43.070
Now raise your right
hand for the pledge.

01:17:45.516 --> 01:17:46.414
Right!

01:17:48.252 --> 01:17:51.016
And repeat after me. I...

01:17:52.623 --> 01:17:53.590
...your name...

01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:55.255
...your name...

01:17:55.593 --> 01:17:58.653
Schmucks!
... pledge allegiance...

01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:00.327
...pledge allegiance...

01:18:00.698 --> 01:18:02.256
...to Hedley Lamarr...

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.158
...to Hedy Lamarr...

01:18:04.502 --> 01:18:05.491
That's Hedley!

01:18:05.837 --> 01:18:07.031
...that's Hedley...

01:18:07.472 --> 01:18:09.099
...and to the evil...

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:10.930
...and to the evil...

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:12.936
...for which he stands!

01:18:13.277 --> 01:18:14.676
...for which he stands!

01:18:15.046 --> 01:18:19.710
Now go do that voodoo
that you do so well!

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:35.628
Hold the happiness. We are in trouble.

01:18:37.034 --> 01:18:39.502
Yep! We forgot one little detail.

01:18:39.737 --> 01:18:43.468
Nothing is missing. Everything is here,
down to the last hitching post.

01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:46.202
People. There are no people.

01:18:46.544 --> 01:18:48.978
Now don't panic. Don't panic.

01:18:49.747 --> 01:18:52.545
We just made a perfect copy
of Rock Ridge.

01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:56.308
Now all we've got to do is make
perfect copies of ourselves.

01:18:57.655 --> 01:18:59.816
But they'll be here in half an hour.

01:19:00.158 --> 01:19:02.319
Right, so we've got to
start working fast.

01:19:02.693 --> 01:19:06.424
You men start working on the dummies.
Jim and Mongo, come with me.

01:19:06.998 --> 01:19:10.661
I've got an idea that will
slow them down to a crawl.

01:19:11.002 --> 01:19:11.900
All right, let's go!

01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:22.102
Yeah, that's nice.

01:19:44.268 --> 01:19:48.932
Le Petomane Thruway! Now what
will that asshole think of next?

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:53.533
Has anybody got a dime?

01:19:55.246 --> 01:19:58.409
Somebody's got to go back
and get a shit-load of dimes.

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:11.561
Hurry up. Speed it up or we're
never going to get to Rock Ridge!

01:20:12.129 --> 01:20:14.893
Come on, move them through!

01:20:21.138 --> 01:20:23.072
Well, they're through the tollbooth.

01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:28.067
Look at this, they're buying it!

01:20:38.422 --> 01:20:41.858
All right, here we go.
Hold your ears, folks!

01:20:42.326 --> 01:20:43.918
It's show time!

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:49.496
Nothing!

01:20:49.834 --> 01:20:51.096
What are we going to do?

01:20:51.535 --> 01:20:54.834
Any minute now they're going to discover
the town is fake and pull out!

01:20:57.341 --> 01:20:59.844
You think you could squeeze off
a little shot from here...

01:20:59.944 --> 01:21:01.935
...and set off the dynamite down there?

01:21:03.047 --> 01:21:04.378
I'll give it a try.

01:21:15.026 --> 01:21:18.359
Oh, Lord, keep this man's eye keen...

01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:20.620
...and may God grant...

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.038
It's a fake!

01:21:34.378 --> 01:21:35.970
We've been suckered in!

01:21:53.164 --> 01:21:56.600
Okay, folks, let's wipe them out!

01:22:21.192 --> 01:22:22.625
Forgive me, Lord!

01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:27.758
"Throw out your hands,
stick out your tush.

01:23:27.858 --> 01:23:29.849
"Hands on your hips,
give them a push.

01:23:30.161 --> 01:23:33.494
"You'll be surprised, you're doing
the French Mistake. Voilà!"

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:37.498
All right, cut!

01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:43.595
Wrong!

01:23:46.811 --> 01:23:50.269
Just watch me. It's so simple!

01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:51.945
You sissy Marys!

01:23:52.616 --> 01:23:56.985
Give me the playback.
And watch me, faggots!

01:24:10.367 --> 01:24:11.299
Have you got it?

01:24:11.635 --> 01:24:12.863
Yessssssss.

01:24:13.838 --> 01:24:15.533
Sounds like steam escaping!

01:24:16.073 --> 01:24:19.236
Action! Okay, wait until I get out.

01:24:50.007 --> 01:24:53.943
Cut! What in the hell
do you think you're doing here?

01:24:54.278 --> 01:24:56.178
This is a closed set!

01:24:57.248 --> 01:24:59.910
Piss on you!
I'm working for Mel Brooks.

01:25:00.251 --> 01:25:02.185
Not in the face!

01:25:04.121 --> 01:25:05.053
Thank you.

01:25:05.589 --> 01:25:08.558
They've hit Buddy!
Come on, girls!

01:25:18.269 --> 01:25:19.930
You vulgar shit!

01:25:20.371 --> 01:25:23.033
Why, you miserable pansy!

01:25:27.745 --> 01:25:29.372
I'm parked over by the commissary.

01:25:34.251 --> 01:25:37.743
You brute, you brute,
you vicious brute!

01:25:39.490 --> 01:25:41.481
All right, all right...

01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:58.101
How many days do you have left, Joey?

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:00.943
They lose me right
after the bunker scene.

01:26:03.514 --> 01:26:04.606
What the hell is that?

01:26:10.387 --> 01:26:13.288
Get your pies for the great pie fight!

01:26:17.528 --> 01:26:20.397
This is our Studio commissary
where some Hollywood stars...

01:26:20.497 --> 01:26:22.192
...come to eat. Keep in line.

01:26:29.707 --> 01:26:32.301
And now we'll go to the
Special Effects Department.

01:26:37.214 --> 01:26:40.411
Yankee bean soup, cole slaw
and tuna surprise.

01:27:20.858 --> 01:27:21.847
Taxi!

01:27:27.298 --> 01:27:28.856
Drive me off this picture!

01:27:58.295 --> 01:27:59.387
You dropped your beads.

01:27:59.730 --> 01:28:00.719
One, please.

01:28:02.566 --> 01:28:03.897
Uh, student.

01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:05.390
Are you kidding?

01:28:07.971 --> 01:28:09.131
Pain in the ass.

01:28:09.773 --> 01:28:12.105
Look, Herman,
I'm in Hedy Lamarr's shoes!

01:28:12.409 --> 01:28:13.239
Hedley!

01:28:42.339 --> 01:28:43.169
Freeze it!

01:28:44.174 --> 01:28:46.438
Okay, Lamarr, go for your gun.

01:28:46.777 --> 01:28:49.837
Wait, wait, I'm unarmed.

01:28:50.347 --> 01:28:53.282
All right, we'll settle it like men.

01:28:54.852 --> 01:28:55.819
With our fists.

01:28:57.187 --> 01:29:00.987
Sorry, I just remembered. I am armed.

01:29:08.565 --> 01:29:13.229
How did he do such fantastic stunts
with such little feet?

01:29:19.209 --> 01:29:20.870
You shot the bad guy!

01:29:23.414 --> 01:29:24.881
Well, what do you want to do now?

01:29:25.582 --> 01:29:27.914
Come on, let's check out
the end of the flick.

01:29:28.819 --> 01:29:31.583
I sure hope there's a happy ending.
I love a happy ending.

01:29:37.161 --> 01:29:40.221
Sheriff, you can't go now.
We need you.

01:29:40.931 --> 01:29:44.492
My work here is done.
I'm needed elsewhere now.

01:29:45.269 --> 01:29:48.238
I'm needed wherever
outlaws rule the West.

01:29:48.572 --> 01:29:52.565
Wherever innocent women and children
are afraid to walk the streets.

01:29:53.243 --> 01:29:56.007
Wherever a man cannot
live in simple dignity.

01:29:56.346 --> 01:30:00.077
Wherever people cry out for justice.

01:30:00.918 --> 01:30:02.249
Bullshit!

01:30:05.055 --> 01:30:06.386
All right, you caught me.

01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:09.721
To speak the plain truth, it's getting
pretty damn dull around here.

01:30:10.461 --> 01:30:13.692
Good luck, Bart, and God bless you.

01:30:18.936 --> 01:30:20.267
'Bye, baby brother.

01:30:22.406 --> 01:30:24.101
Keep the faith, brothers!

01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:42.081
Where are you headed, cowboy?

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.720
Nowhere special.

01:30:47.731 --> 01:30:52.395
Nowhere special.
I always wanted to go there.

01:30:54.404 --> 01:30:55.166
Come on!

01:31:26.503 --> 01:31:30.269
"He conquered fear and
he conquered hate. "

01:31:30.607 --> 01:31:33.940
"He turned our night into day. "

01:31:34.305 --> 01:31:40.754
