02:09.170 --> 02:11.170
Great. Another one.

Hey, Liv. Big fan,
probably your biggest.

investing, Sycorax,

Baymax, they get it.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.710
I have noted this
in my database.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.250
Can we please focus?

10:46.250 --> 10:48.120
We don't know anything
about this little--

10:48.120 --> 10:49.750
(sneezes)
Mayoi.

10:49.750 --> 10:53.210
(cooing):
We know it needs a bath.
Yes, it does.

10:53.210 --> 10:56.170
It's dusty.
I'm just being sanitary.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.210
(yawns, chitters)

10:58.210 --> 11:01.120
Aw, I love it so much!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.750
The cuteness is a trap!

11:02.750 --> 11:05.080
-Mayoi.
-Look what you did.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.120
-Baymax: I love him so much.
-(Hiro groans)

11:09.120 --> 11:11.120
Professor Granville
is a total hardcase.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.210
She won't buy
the cute act for a second.

11:13.210 --> 11:14.920
Being cute
can be an act?

11:14.920 --> 11:17.040
Yeah! Sometimes!
This time.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.790
I have noted this
in my database.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.500
-(gasps)
-(Granville coos)

11:22.500 --> 11:25.880
(cooing):
Who's my fuzzy-wuzzy?
You're my fuzzy-wuzzy!

11:27.120 --> 11:28.880
(purring)

11:31.080 --> 11:32.960
(door creaking)

11:35.080 --> 11:37.380
Does nobody care where
these things came from?

11:37.380 --> 11:41.210
Baymax:
Their cuteness seems
to be the primary focus.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.120
Karmi, wait! I was
about to come see you.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.500
-Ew, why?
-Did the Mayoi
come from Sycorax?

11:45.500 --> 11:48.120
-What?
-Right? The Mayoi?
Liv thing?

11:48.120 --> 11:50.500
Stop projecting
your paranoid delusions
on my boss.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.210
Paranoid?
I-I'm not paranoid!

11:53.210 --> 11:54.790
It's so pathetic.

11:54.790 --> 11:56.710
I'm actually starting
to feel bad for you.

11:56.710 --> 11:59.420
Well, I feel worse for you,

11:59.420 --> 12:01.210
because Liv created
these things,

12:01.210 --> 12:03.960
and even if they look cute,
they're monsters.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.330
-Yeah, I'm terrified.
-(purring)

12:08.330 --> 12:10.040
(sighs)

12:10.040 --> 12:11.540
-(camera clicking)
-Mayoi.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.420
(purring)

12:15.210 --> 12:17.250
-Mayoi.
-Mayoi!

12:17.250 --> 12:19.210
(purring)

12:20.710 --> 12:22.960
I never knew how
much of my heart

12:22.960 --> 12:25.120
-I was
not using.
-Mayoi!

12:25.120 --> 12:26.580
(purring)

12:26.580 --> 12:29.170
Aah. Not you, too,
Aunt Cass.

12:29.170 --> 12:32.460
(cooing):
What a good boy!
Yes, I'm talking about you.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.880
-You're a good boy!
-(Mochi meows)

12:34.880 --> 12:37.790
Does being a "good boy"
make one cute?

12:37.790 --> 12:39.670
Well, it doesn't hurt.

12:39.670 --> 12:40.880
Come pet Mario.

12:40.880 --> 12:43.080
No, thanks. I'm good.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.580
I do not understand
why you dislike the Mayoi.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.880
Do you not want
to scratch their chins?

12:47.880 --> 12:51.170
Liv's messing with us.
I-I know it!

12:51.170 --> 12:53.750
(sighs)
Or maybe everyone is right,

12:53.750 --> 12:55.960
and maybe I'm just losing it.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.210
-(alert beeping)
-(Hiro gasps)

12:59.210 --> 13:00.290
We have a problem!

13:00.290 --> 13:02.290
-What's the problem?
-(purring)

13:02.290 --> 13:05.120
-(all grunting)
-Fred: It... grew.

13:05.120 --> 13:06.880
I hate to say
I told you so.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.830
-Mayoi!
-(groans) Then don't.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.670
-But I did warn-- Aah!
-Mayoi!

13:11.670 --> 13:14.540
(groans)
Fred, what did you feed it?

13:14.540 --> 13:16.750
I gave him a bunch
of tofu nuggets.

13:16.750 --> 13:19.750
-Tofu nuggets?
-Heathcliff always said
they're good for growing boys.

13:19.750 --> 13:23.290
And I guess he was right,
because this boy is grown!

13:23.290 --> 13:26.120
If this Mayoi suddenly got big,
what about the others?

13:26.120 --> 13:27.500
Maybe it's just ours?

13:27.500 --> 13:29.080
-Baymax: It is not.
-(news alert beeps)

13:29.080 --> 13:32.000
Breaking news. It looks
like our darling Mayoi are

13:32.000 --> 13:34.210
all grown up
and destroying the city.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.290
But come on. I mean, adorbs.

13:36.290 --> 13:37.620
(gruff voice):
Mayoi! (purrs)

13:37.620 --> 13:39.330
-(clattering)
- Aah! Still cute!

13:39.330 --> 13:44.080
(sighs)
I know who can help us
find out what's going on.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.120
-You're kidding, right?
-Will you just look at it,
please?

13:47.120 --> 13:48.250
(gruff voice):
Mayoi. (purring)

13:48.250 --> 13:49.330
(groans)

13:51.830 --> 13:53.210
Hmm. Interesting.

13:53.210 --> 13:54.790
Is there something
in the fur?

13:54.790 --> 13:58.080
(groans)
It's not fur, genius.
It's fungus.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.500
Ew, I cuddled it.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.380
Karmi:
The Mayoi are more
plantlike than mammalian.

14:03.380 --> 14:06.500
-That's possible?
-Scanning for hybrid
characteristics.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.290
Yes, the Mayoi
are photosynthetic.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.210
Exactly! They get
energy from the Sun,

14:11.210 --> 14:14.120
but they're also processing
regular food, which explains--

14:14.120 --> 14:16.000
(gasps):
The accelerated
growth rate!

14:16.000 --> 14:18.750
Whoa! It's fur is vibrating
on an atomic level.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.670
Nanochemical oscillations,
it's how plants communicate.

14:21.670 --> 14:24.540
I don't know what
they're saying, but
with a little more study...

14:24.540 --> 14:26.380
-Are they done growing?
-(elastic crackling)

14:26.380 --> 14:28.830
(deep voice):
Mayoi! Mayoi!

14:28.830 --> 14:31.250
(grunting):
Does that answer your question?

14:31.250 --> 14:33.000
Baymax:
Yes, it does. Thank you.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.710
Can you reverse this?

14:34.710 --> 14:38.040
Maybe. I need time,
and space!

14:38.040 --> 14:39.790
(muffled):
We might not have either.

14:39.790 --> 14:41.750
(bellows):
Mayoi!

14:41.750 --> 14:44.170
(gurgling)

14:44.170 --> 14:46.710
Baymax:
Is this still considered cute?

14:46.710 --> 14:48.080
(cooing, giggling)

14:49.620 --> 14:51.960
Mayoi. Mayoi.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.250
Mayoi. Mayoi.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.250
-(woman screaming)
-(car alarm blaring)

14:59.250 --> 15:02.120
-Mayoi.
-Remember when
they were small?

15:02.120 --> 15:03.830
-Wasabi: I miss that.
-Fred: Ow! Ow!

15:03.830 --> 15:06.670
Fred (chuckling):
They grow up so fast,
don't-- Ow! Ow!

15:06.670 --> 15:07.790
Literally.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.290
Honey Lemon:
Guys, bring them
towards campus.

15:09.290 --> 15:11.000
-Roger that!
-We'll try!

15:11.880 --> 15:14.420
-Mayoi!
-(Fred sighs)

15:14.420 --> 15:16.290
Mayoi.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.540
Hey, I got an idea.

15:17.540 --> 15:19.210
You wanna play?
You wanna play?

15:19.210 --> 15:21.040
Okay. Go fetch!

15:22.830 --> 15:25.170
Fred:
Oh yeah! Woo!

15:25.170 --> 15:27.790
Hey, they like
shiny things, too?

15:27.790 --> 15:31.170
See the light?
Follow the light!

15:31.170 --> 15:33.710
They're following the light!

15:33.710 --> 15:35.790
Mayoi!

15:47.540 --> 15:50.380
Good job, guys. We just need
to keep them happy and relaxed.

15:50.380 --> 15:52.380
-(warbling)
-What?

15:53.290 --> 15:57.670
All (echoing):
Mayoi. Mayoi. Mayoi...

16:02.420 --> 16:05.170
-(static crackles)
- Hello, San Fransokyo!

16:05.170 --> 16:07.040
(flames whooshing)

16:09.960 --> 16:11.380
Are you enjoying
my adorable little gifts?

16:11.380 --> 16:14.250
Except they're not so little
anymore, are they?

16:14.250 --> 16:17.040
-No, they're really big!
-That was rhetorical.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.120
That's right, San Fransokyo.
I've been cooking up

16:19.120 --> 16:21.250
all sorts of
monstery surprises!

16:21.250 --> 16:23.000
It was me!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.750
Wasabi:
They're not moving!

16:24.750 --> 16:26.750
(grunting)

16:26.750 --> 16:28.750
Whoa. I need a shower.

16:28.750 --> 16:31.040
Liked Orso Knox?
Loved the Hibagon?

16:31.040 --> 16:34.250
Enjoyed Momakase?
Disturbed by High Voltage?

16:34.250 --> 16:36.670
I made eels, people!
Eel people!

16:36.670 --> 16:39.040
Sparkles is behind
the monsters?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.330
All me! I have
a very good brain!

16:41.330 --> 16:44.000
-Why?
- For the notoriety, doi!

16:45.670 --> 16:47.920
(cackling)

16:49.460 --> 16:52.500
(breathes deeply)
Watch me work.

17:00.670 --> 17:02.540
-(gasping)
-Baymax.

17:02.540 --> 17:05.210
(rockets firing)

17:05.210 --> 17:06.790
Mayoi.

17:08.540 --> 17:10.460
The main attraction starts now.

17:10.460 --> 17:11.750
Can you guess what it is?

17:11.750 --> 17:15.460
It's me destroying the city
with my fat fur babies!

17:15.460 --> 17:18.080
May I, Mayoi?
(laughing): Still talking!

17:19.290 --> 17:21.170
(roaring)

17:24.380 --> 17:25.920
Go Go: How is
he doing this?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.420
Wasabi:
It's like he's
controlling them!

17:27.420 --> 17:29.290
(warbling)

17:29.290 --> 17:31.380
(roaring)

17:34.880 --> 17:36.380
Vibrations!

17:36.380 --> 17:38.540
Sparkles is communicating
with the Mayoi.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.500
Using nanochemical
oscillations!

17:40.500 --> 17:43.750
Just for fun,
this time, let's explain it
in comic book terms.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.330
Hiro:
Pseudo-telepathy.

17:45.330 --> 17:46.710
Mind control?
That's number eight

17:46.710 --> 17:48.500
on my top ten list
of superpowers!

17:48.500 --> 17:50.670
And number one
on our list of problems.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.420
How do we stop it?

17:52.420 --> 17:53.500
(grunts)

17:54.540 --> 17:55.830
(disc thuds)

17:55.830 --> 17:58.330
Oh, did I mention that I can
see whatever the Mayoi see?

17:58.330 --> 17:59.380
(growls)

17:59.380 --> 18:01.210
I now have eyes
in the back of my head.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.380
Not literally.
It's an idiom.
Never stop learning!

18:03.380 --> 18:06.040
Say bye-bye to your
big heroes, folks.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.790
-(Sparkles cackling)
-(Mayoi roaring)

18:13.580 --> 18:15.460
-Aah!
-All: Hiro!

18:15.460 --> 18:17.290
Baymax:
Oh, no.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.380
(roaring)

18:23.380 --> 18:25.420
(Mayoi squeaks, purrs)

18:26.460 --> 18:29.670
Mayoi!
(squeaking)

18:29.670 --> 18:31.710
Plot twist. Who's this?

18:31.710 --> 18:34.790
Liv Amara, and I am here
to save this city!

18:34.790 --> 18:36.960
Fred:
What?

18:36.960 --> 18:39.750
I saw the trouble on TV,
so I synthesized a method

18:39.750 --> 18:41.420
to return the Mayoi
to normal.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.420
Sorry I asked.
Crush her!

18:46.420 --> 18:48.500
(roaring)

18:53.250 --> 18:55.460
(Mayoi whimper)

18:55.460 --> 18:57.420
Mayoi. (purring)

18:57.420 --> 18:58.790
I think you need this.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.500
-(engine revs)
-(tires screech)

19:01.210 --> 19:03.880
Hey! Big Hero 6!

19:03.880 --> 19:07.170
-Baymax: It is currently
the only option.
-Thanks.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.880
(Mayoi roaring)

19:31.750 --> 19:34.290
-(Mayoi squeaking)
-It's not over yet!

19:35.170 --> 19:36.620
(roaring)

19:41.540 --> 19:43.380
(Sparkles cackling)

19:44.750 --> 19:46.790
-Uh-oh.
-(roaring)

19:46.790 --> 19:48.670
Baymax, shoulder throw.

19:48.670 --> 19:50.880
(Sparkles shrieks)

19:50.880 --> 19:53.000
(grunting)
Super jump!

19:55.670 --> 19:59.500
-Mayoi.
-Sparkles: This is not
how I saw this going!

19:59.500 --> 20:01.670
-(Sparkles shrieks)
-(Mayoi squeaking)

20:01.670 --> 20:03.330
Baymax:
They are cute again.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.670
Hiro:
Yeah, real cute.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.380
I find your sarcasm hurtful.

20:06.380 --> 20:08.460
(mewing, purring)

20:08.460 --> 20:10.080
Have a great weekend, everybody!

20:10.080 --> 20:12.580
-Non sequitur. Look it up!
-Hiro: Hey!

20:12.580 --> 20:15.830
I'll be back with even more
masterful monster mash-ups.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.290
Alliteration. Try it!

20:17.290 --> 20:19.580
Mayoi. Mayoi. Mayoi.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.710
-(cheering)
-Crowd: Yay, Liv! Liv! Liv!

20:23.710 --> 20:27.080
(chanting):
Liv, Liv, Liv! Liv, Liv, Liv!

20:27.080 --> 20:30.250
Thank you!
Helping, it's what I do.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.210
In conclusion,
we are very lucky

20:35.210 --> 20:37.420
to have Liv Amara
in our fair city.

20:37.420 --> 20:40.880
Since Mr. Sparkles took
credit for the monsters,
everyone thinks Liv is a--

20:40.880 --> 20:43.290
Baymax:
Hiro, you appear agitated.

20:43.290 --> 20:46.580
I have used my data to create
an image of something cute.

20:46.580 --> 20:48.210
Perhaps it will soothe you.

20:48.210 --> 20:50.250
(gasping)

20:50.250 --> 20:53.750
Thanks, Baymax.
That's... very special.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.670
Yes, he is a good boy.
Good boy!

20:56.670 --> 20:59.330
Look at his big eyes,
pudgy waist,

20:59.330 --> 21:01.460
and fuzzy-wuzzy
wittle feet.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.000
There's no way Sparkles
could've been behind this.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.710
Liv showing up
as the "surprise hero"?

21:06.710 --> 21:08.880
Ugh. Typical villain fake-out.

21:08.880 --> 21:09.920
She's good.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.380
Yeah, but what's her endgame?

21:13.380 --> 21:15.380
(buzzing, beeping)
