WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:02.081
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.200 --> 00:03.201
Are you Wesen?

00:03.280 --> 00:04.406
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

00:05.600 --> 00:07.250
Please,
get me out of here.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.050
Eat this.
You have food.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.924
You will
need your strength.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.010
I know where your baby is.

00:15.880 --> 00:17.041
- Shut up!
- Listen to me.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.329
We figured out a way for you
to get your Grimm back.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.601
There is a key
ingredient missing.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.571
What is it?

00:26.520 --> 00:30.605
"A liar will not be believed,
even when he speaks the truth."

00:32.640 --> 00:33.641
Huh?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.126
What do you mean, me?

00:36.720 --> 00:40.327
Elizabeth recreated the potion
that Adalind used on Nick.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.131
Yeah. And in order
to re-Grimm Nick,

00:44.120 --> 00:47.203
you have to, you know,
do what Adalind did.

00:48.120 --> 00:49.929
Do what Adalind did?

00:50.800 --> 00:51.926
Seriously?

00:52.040 --> 00:53.326
Exactly what
Adalind did.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.401
Yeah.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.929
You know, breathe in
the potion, and...

00:57.440 --> 00:58.680
And what?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.441
And make love to you.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.126
Make love to me?

01:02.800 --> 01:03.767
That's it?

01:03.840 --> 01:05.444
See? Not so bad, right?

01:07.120 --> 01:08.884
Why do I get the feeling
there's more to it than that?

01:10.480 --> 01:13.324
When you do it,
you won't exactly be you.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.121
What do you mean?

01:16.200 --> 01:18.521
The potion will
transform you into...

01:20.800 --> 01:22.450
Oh, God, no.
You don't mean...

01:27.280 --> 01:28.691
Adalind.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.884
AUSTRIA

01:34.720 --> 01:36.131
I know where your baby is.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.571
I know where your baby is.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.810
I know where your baby is.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.323
How did I get here?

01:44.440 --> 01:46.283
I told you
not to wake them.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.010
They knew
where my baby was.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.322
You heard what you
want them to say.

01:50.520 --> 01:51.885
Now, hurry!

01:52.000 --> 01:53.365
Don't stop.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.646
There's a baby
back there.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.808
Do not go back!
That's my baby!

02:13.520 --> 02:15.010
Where's my baby?

02:15.480 --> 02:17.244
Wait! Do you know where she is?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.286
Have you checked
the bedrooms?

02:20.360 --> 02:21.361
Of course, dear.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.364
And...
And all the doors?

02:23.520 --> 02:25.045
I've checked everywhere.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.122
You're safe.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.722
Please, promise me
he won't be here.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.251
I promise.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.887
Here, take your pills.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.770
Then we'll get
you into bed.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.922
You've got to get
some sleep.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.323
You'll feel better
in the morning.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.040
So, you're saying I have to
breathe it in through this hat,

03:03.800 --> 03:05.768
and turn into
Adalind, and...

03:06.000 --> 03:09.049
Do everything
Adalind did as you.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.124
And I'm supposed to
sleep with Juliette,

03:13.760 --> 03:15.603
only she's going
to look like Adalind?

03:15.760 --> 03:19.128
To break Adalind's spell, we
need to reverse it exactly.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.130
Every step she took
also needs to be reversed.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.406
No way.

03:23.480 --> 03:24.766
We're not putting
Juliette through that.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.842
The complex nature
of Adalind's spell

03:26.920 --> 03:29.161
may have unintended
effects on Nick.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.290
They could only
grow worse.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.408
Might be just as
dangerous to do nothing.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.210
That's my problem, not hers.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.011
Then there's
nothing more I can do.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.448
Wait.
If I do this,

03:40.920 --> 03:44.766
and I transform
into Adalind,

03:45.920 --> 03:47.081
it's still me, right?

03:47.160 --> 03:48.730
I mean, I would know it's me.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.407
Yes.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.481
And Nick would know it's you.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.050
And presumably, you would know
that Nick knows that it's you.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.925
Yeah, but she wouldn't be
looking like Juliette.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.366
Just sayin'.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.360
Maybe think of it
like wearing a costume.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.087
A costume of a woman
who tried to kill me.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.680
Hey, I don't think it's so much
about the romance, it's really...

04:14.760 --> 04:15.921
It's about getting it done.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.685
Just sayin'.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.522
I would suggest
a very dark room.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.285
Forget it.

04:27.120 --> 04:28.121
No more potions.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.204
Nick, if you wanna be a Grimm
again, this is the only way.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.609
We're gonna need a little
time to think about this.

04:38.680 --> 04:39.647
We get it, Nick.
You...

04:39.720 --> 04:41.210
No, take your time.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.048
If you
do change your mind,

04:49.760 --> 04:51.091
do it quickly.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.646
I won't be here much longer.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.731
I'm gonna go to bed.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.601
A normal life
sounds really good.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.722
Can we really go back to that?

05:11.160 --> 05:13.640
This is our chance
to find out.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.241
Okay.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.363
What are you doing up so late, Ava?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.246
But who am I to talk?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.209
I should be
in bed, too.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.809
Ava, I'm your friend.

06:05.880 --> 06:06.881
You came looking
for me, didn't you?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.041
No. No!

06:08.120 --> 06:09.451
You're not really here.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.290
Ava, I'm your friend.

06:14.560 --> 06:17.211
I know you're having
trouble believing in me,

06:17.400 --> 06:20.085
but I'm here because
you want me to be.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.122
You seem
so nervous.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.645
Why don't you have a drink of this?
It'll calm you.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.169
That's better.
Drink it all.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.806
Ava, now you've
hurt yourself.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.490
Please, come back.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.403
I'm only trying to help you.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.007
Ava!

07:10.720 --> 07:11.881
Ava, stop!

07:13.360 --> 07:14.441
Ava!

07:16.000 --> 07:19.004
Ava, calm down. Running
away is not going to help.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.650
Morning.
Morning.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.481
Everything okay?

08:14.440 --> 08:15.566
Yeah.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.926
You sure?

08:19.320 --> 08:20.845
Uh, sort of.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.201
What's going on?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.011
Look, I've been thinking,

08:25.320 --> 08:27.243
I can understand why you don't
want to be like me anymore,

08:28.680 --> 08:30.648
but I'm not sure I should stay
here if I'm the only Grimm.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.561
Listen, Trubel...

08:33.640 --> 08:35.722
If I stick around, I'll only
be putting you in danger.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.761
You and Juliette
are safer without me.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.962
You can't have a normal
life if I'm here.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.520
You don't have to leave until...

08:51.600 --> 08:52.647
Oh.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.728
Hey, Nick.
How you doin'? Uh...

08:55.280 --> 08:56.884
Hey, sorry, I didn't mean
to bother you so early,

08:56.960 --> 08:58.928
but I really thought
it was important,

08:59.000 --> 09:00.968
you know,
to offer my condolences.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.809
And...
And my wife's, too.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.161
We heard about you losing your, uh...
I mean, not having your...

09:05.920 --> 09:07.649
Well, you know, your whole
Grimm thing being kaput.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.487
I'm so sorry. It's the worst
thing that ever happened.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.087
By the way, is Trubel here?

09:13.360 --> 09:14.646
Uh, yeah, actually.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.486
I'm here.
Oh.

09:16.560 --> 09:18.164
Oh. Oh, good,
good,good.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.969
We haven't
really formally met yet.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.286
I'm Bud.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.407
Uh...

09:22.480 --> 09:24.642
Uh, we sort of ran into each other
when you broke up the wedding.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.689
I don't mean broke up
in a bad way.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.041
Although it was
pretty unnerving.

09:29.480 --> 09:33.087
Uh, anyway, I was really relieved to
hear that you were a friend of Nick's.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.966
As were all my friends who
were there at the wedding.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.289
I mean, wow.  I never thought
I'd meet one Grimm, let alone two.

09:39.480 --> 09:40.686
What do you need?
What do you need?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.728
Uh, I'm glad you asked.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.849
Uh, I was wondering if you'd
be willing to help me.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.849
I mean, uh,
now that you can't.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.490
Not that, that reflects on you
in any negative capacity.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.128
Uh, but I have this
little Wesen-type problem.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.650
Bud, if this is a police
matter I can still help you.

09:58.840 --> 09:59.841
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.921
It's really kinda
small potatoes.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.680
You see, my kid is being bullied
by this Wesen kid at school,

10:04.040 --> 10:05.883
and, uh, I thought maybe
Trubel could talk to him,

10:06.280 --> 10:08.169
you know, smooth things over,
straighten things out.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.566
I mean, if she was willing to.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.206
That is,
if you are willing to.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.606
You got this?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.166
Sure.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.725
Well, I'll leave it
to you then.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.081
I gotta get to
the precinct anyway.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.605
See ya.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.204
I lied. We got a huge problem.

10:28.280 --> 10:29.850
Nick's in trouble!
What?

10:29.960 --> 10:31.485
What are you talking about?
It's all my fault.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.364
I told Monroe
and Rosalee that

10:33.440 --> 10:35.761
I wouldn't tell anybody that
Nick's not a Grimm anymore.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.241
But then I had a few beers
with my buddy Frank,

10:38.640 --> 10:40.324
who said he
wouldn't tell anybody.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.244
But then I heard that
Frank blabbed it to Phil,

10:42.320 --> 10:43.606
and Phil spilled it to Joe,

10:43.680 --> 10:46.081
and Joe leaked it to this
Klaustreich fella named Shaw.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.561
Well, who the hell is Shaw?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.524
Believe me,
you don't wanna know.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.042
But that's why I'm here,
you're gonna have to know.

10:52.520 --> 10:54.170
Shaw is bad news.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.644
He's got some kind
of beef with Nick.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.330
When he heard that Nick's
not a Grimm anymore,

10:58.400 --> 11:01.210
he started tellin' everybody that
he was gonna teach him a lesson.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.488
And by "lesson," I think he
means he's gonna kill him.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.007
And I can't stop him.
And you're the only Grimm now.

11:06.280 --> 11:08.965
So now you know why I'm here, and
why I had to lie to Nick, right?

11:09.160 --> 11:10.605
You know where to find
this Shaw guy?

11:10.680 --> 11:12.045
I got no idea.

11:12.240 --> 11:13.969
But I know Frank,
and Frank knows Phil,

11:14.040 --> 11:15.166
and Joe...
I get it.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.481
We need to talk to Joe.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.607
Yeah.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.920
Your new home must
have cost a small fortune.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.241
Thank God you had one.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.761
Security here

11:29.840 --> 11:31.365
is far better
than what I had before.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.527
Good.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.444
Because I can only
save you that way once.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.123
I know what that
must have cost you.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.124
I'm very grateful.

11:41.520 --> 11:42.681
Did you happen to
meet the young woman

11:42.760 --> 11:43.807
staying with
Nick and Juliette?

11:43.880 --> 11:45.609
I did.
She seemed very capable.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.171
She decapitated a Hundjager.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.281
You think she knew that?

11:50.800 --> 11:52.643
It would explain why
she's staying with Nick.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.606
She has to be a Grimm.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.125
I sensed something
about her.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.289
Just as I sense
something about you.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.961
What?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.003
You want to tell me
who has my granddaughter.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.201
I do, but it won't do any good.
No one knows where she is.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.045
Tell me who has her.

12:11.760 --> 12:12.841
Kelly Burkhardt.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.081
Nick's mother.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.844
Also a Grimm?
Yeah.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.601
A very dangerous one.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.331
You know
I'm going to find her.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.846
I know you're gonna try.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.766
Let me look at you.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.802
I need to make sure
you're okay.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.209
There's no lingering effects
from what I've done.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.090
God, I'm good.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.571
Sooner or later
Wu's gonna figure out

12:49.640 --> 12:51.927
Trubel's got more to her
than what we've told him.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.441
That's going to open up
a big can of Wesen.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.051
What am I supposed
to tell him?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.129
That I used to be a Grimm,
but I'm not anymore

12:58.200 --> 13:01.249
because I slept with a Hexenbiest
who changed into Juliette

13:01.320 --> 13:03.368
because we took her baby
away, and gave it to my mom?

13:03.440 --> 13:04.965
Gotta start somewhere.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.241
What do we got?

13:06.320 --> 13:07.890
Looks like
vehicular manslaughter.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.201
Driver was impaired.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.129
Looks like she lost
control of her vehicle,

13:11.200 --> 13:13.248
hit the victim
who was jogging,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.561
and pirouetted
her way into a wall.

13:17.640 --> 13:19.210
Victim's name
is Jason Landros.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.528
Lives just down the street.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.045
Wrong place,
wrong time.

13:23.200 --> 13:25.726
Happened earlier this morning,
so the street was deserted.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.245
But the driver's husband
was at the scene.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.889
Their house is back there.
Driver's name is Ava Dias.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.764
Her husband was at home
when she got in the car.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.651
He says he ran outside to try and
stop her, but he was too late.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.043
He made the 911 call, rode in the
ambulance with her to Saint Joe's.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.161
Is she injured?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.571
Abrasions from the air bag.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.326
But she was pretty out of it, couldn't
get a clear answer out of her.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.448
Except for the part
about a wolf.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.241
A wolf?

13:49.320 --> 13:51.049
She didn't say if it was
two-legged or four-legged,

13:51.120 --> 13:53.122
but she was pretty adamant
about it talking to her.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.568
I really didn't wanna push it,
considering she was yelling it

13:55.640 --> 13:57.449
while she was being
loaded into an ambulance.

13:57.880 --> 14:01.566
But, you know, I'm ready to believe
anything at this point in my life.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.081
Even wolves?

14:03.560 --> 14:04.721
I don't judge anymore.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.001
Lot of things are just
open to interpretation.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.801
Don't you think?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.204
Depends on how much
you've had to drink.

14:14.040 --> 14:15.166
Secure the house.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.890
We're gonna wanna take a look
at it after we talk to them.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.321
Yeah.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.086
Stop! Where's my baby?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.970
Wait!

14:34.240 --> 14:35.810
Where'd she go?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.285
- Where'd she go?
- Where'd she go?

14:37.360 --> 14:38.930
Where'd she go?

14:43.520 --> 14:44.726
I know.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.884
You just want your baby.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.206
Hey, Joe.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.521
Hey,Bud.
What are you doin' here?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.483
So this is the Joe that can't
keep his mouth shut, huh?

15:01.120 --> 15:02.121
A Grimm?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.009
My God, Bud, you brought
a Grimm to my shop?

15:04.080 --> 15:05.241
Calm down, Joe.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.009
We heard Shaw is
after Nick Burkhardt

15:08.080 --> 15:09.809
because you told him
Nick wasn't a Grimm anymore.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.689
What? No, I didn't.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.002
I mean, well,
not in so many words.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.770
I was at the bar
telling my buddy Wayne

15:15.840 --> 15:17.365
the rumor that's been going on
around the Lodge.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.562
When Shaw heard Burkhardt's
name, he went crazy.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.529
He was all over me, saying he
was gonna pound my face in

15:21.600 --> 15:22.681
if I didn't tell
him everything.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.769
Where do we find Shaw?

15:25.920 --> 15:27.490
Gabriel Martel?

15:28.040 --> 15:29.041
Yes?

15:29.120 --> 15:31.122
Griffin and Burkhardt,
Portland PD.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.489
You're Ava Dias' husband?

15:34.320 --> 15:36.482
I'm sorry,
she can't talk right now.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.531
They had to sedate her when she
found out the man she hit died.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.929
One of our officers
reported to us

15:43.000 --> 15:45.924
that your wife said that she
was being chased by a wolf.

15:48.560 --> 15:52.929
My wife was diagnosed with severe
mental illness about six months ago.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.926
Last night she had
a psychotic episode.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.045
Before I could stop her, she
ran outside, got in her car.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.480
Where were you before that?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.525
Asleep in bed.

16:06.520 --> 16:09.683
I ran downstairs as
soon as I heard her,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.683
but I couldn't
get to her in time.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.762
This is my fault.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.165
Was your wife drinking
last night?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.401
She's not supposed to.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.725
She's on heavy medication.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.689
We're gonna need to
take a look around your house.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.328
I don't want
to leave Ava alone,

16:25.400 --> 16:27.448
unless you need me
to come with you.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.721
Yeah, we do.

16:34.920 --> 16:40.689
I was upstairs asleep in the bedroom
when I heard a glass break.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.127
I realized she
wasn't in the bed,

16:44.200 --> 16:46.441
and I came downstairs
as fast as I could.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.405
Looks like blood.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.323
I think she stepped
on the broken glass.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.761
It's in the kitchen.

16:52.880 --> 16:57.044
When I came in, she was gone.

16:57.920 --> 17:00.446
And then I heard
the car outside.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.806
Your wife has seen
this wolf before?

17:04.960 --> 17:06.121
GABRIEL; Yes.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.127
She describe it to you?

17:09.280 --> 17:11.407
She says that it
looks like a man

17:11.480 --> 17:13.881
with a wolf's head,
and it talks to her.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.681
He says he's trying to help
her, but she's terrified.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.080
I mean, that's
understandable, right?

17:21.800 --> 17:23.882
I can't imagine what
she's going through.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.962
When did she first
tell you about the wolf?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.289
About six months ago.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.044
Right after we moved here. We
were in Sao Paulo before that.

17:33.640 --> 17:38.407
Ava was born here, but she traveled
a lot to Brazil on business.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.005
What kind
of business?

17:40.280 --> 17:42.601
Import-export.
Started by her grandfather.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.041
We met through a charity that
provides medical care to orphans.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.283
One thing led to another,
and we got married.

17:51.120 --> 17:55.284
But after we moved here,
her illness came on rapidly.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.251
Now we're just
trying to survive.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.286
This is a big house.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.286
Just the two of you?

18:02.480 --> 18:04.847
Ava grew up here.
She inherited it.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.051
The housekeeping staff quit
after her problems started.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.929
They couldn't
handle it.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.040
No nurse?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.844
Uh, I'm an MD.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.924
I'm still trying to
establish my practice here.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.729
They don't make it easy
on foreign doctors.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.169
Doesn't matter now anyway.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.720
I spend most of my time
taking care of Ava.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.284
All right, we're gonna
need the contact information

18:27.360 --> 18:28.407
for Ava's psychiatrist.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.041
We think she's
out of her mind?

18:34.120 --> 18:35.121
Maybe.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.084
It could be that's what
we're supposed to think.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.810
I mean, she's rich,
he's pretty smooth.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.530
And she's talking
to a wolf.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.370
I'm thinking Blutbad.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.170
Yeah, I'm thinking
the same thing.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.881
I just wish I could see
it instead of thinking.

18:47.240 --> 18:49.447
Me, too, man. Me, too.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.722
Let's talk to Ava's doctor,
see what she thinks.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.241
We should go.
He's probably not home.

19:01.480 --> 19:02.481
Well, that's his truck.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.686
I don't think he
drives that truck anymore.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.762
I'm pretty sure he got...
Oh, my God, it's him.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.889
Let's not do this.
Let's go.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.402
Oh, no. Oh, no.
What's gonna happen?

19:13.600 --> 19:14.647
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.131
The next time you tell
somebody about something

19:16.200 --> 19:17.486
you shouldn't
tell them about,

19:17.560 --> 19:18.925
you're gonna shut up
before you tell 'em!

19:19.000 --> 19:20.525
He's gonna kill her,
I know it.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.242
You Shaw?
I know you?

19:27.520 --> 19:28.931
I'm a friend of
Nick Burkhardt's.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.929
Is that supposed
to mean something?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.208
I heard you been talkin' about
teachin' him some kind of lesson.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.444
So Burkhardt's sending a little
girl to solve his problems.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.331
You should
listen to her, Shaw.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.526
Bud, I got this.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.489
I know that. I just thought
maybe we could talk this out.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.211
Well, if it ain't Bud
Wurstner, the Grimm-lover.

19:45.360 --> 19:47.089
I'm gonna teach
you a lesson, too,

19:47.160 --> 19:48.810
as soon as I'm through
with this bitch.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.286
You got a big mouth!

19:59.240 --> 20:00.321
You're a Grimm!

20:01.080 --> 20:02.445
That's why I wanted
you to talk.

20:02.680 --> 20:03.886
Forget the talk, Bud.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.766
No,no,no!
Don't kill me!

20:06.840 --> 20:07.921
Why not?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.001
Uh...

20:09.120 --> 20:10.849
Not good enough!

20:13.080 --> 20:16.129
Wait, what if he promises
not to bother Burkhardt ever?

20:16.280 --> 20:17.247
You can do that, right?

20:17.360 --> 20:19.328
Right. Yes, I promise.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.561
I don't believe him.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.641
No,no,no,no,no!
I promise.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.051
He threatened you,
too,Bud.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.491
No, no, I didn't
mean that either.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.561
Yeah, yeah.
It's all right.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.449
I won't bother anybody.
I swear!

20:30.320 --> 20:31.401
Oh, that was close.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.044
Next time it'll be closer.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.245
'Cause if any of your other
friends get the same idea,

20:38.320 --> 20:39.970
they won't be
as lucky as you.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.481
Make sure they know it.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.607
That was great. it couldn't
have gone better, right?

20:49.840 --> 20:51.842
That won't end it.
There will be others.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.845
I should've cut off
his head.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.441
Ava came to me right after she
started having psychotic episodes.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.126
Over the last few weeks, they've
become more and more frequent.

21:01.200 --> 21:02.770
Are all the encounters
the same?

21:02.920 --> 21:06.561
Her descriptions of the wolf
are consistent and detailed.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.563
Do you think that
she sees this wolf?

21:08.840 --> 21:10.001
I have no doubt.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.444
We've tried several combinations
of anti-psychotics.

21:13.680 --> 21:14.841
None proved effective.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.290
Do you intend to charge
Ava with a crime?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.324
We haven't made
that determination.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.041
Well, if you do,

21:22.160 --> 21:24.128
I will testify
that she was mentally

21:24.200 --> 21:26.089
incompetent at the time
of the accident

21:26.160 --> 21:28.640
and, in my judgment,
she should be

21:28.720 --> 21:31.371
institutionalized
rather than incarcerated.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.361
I asked Ava
to draw the wolf.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.407
And I will present her
drawings as evidence.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.922
In any case, I recommend
that she remain hospitalized

21:43.000 --> 21:46.561
until we know that she's no longer
a danger to herself or others.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.484
PHILADELPHIA

22:05.280 --> 22:07.806
Okay, Dad,
you're home.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.602
Oh, my God.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.602
I heard something.
Downstairs.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.571
He's here!

22:37.960 --> 22:39.246
MAN 22 Get him!

22:56.440 --> 22:58.681
These are interesting.
Who drew these?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.611
A woman we think is being
stalked by a Wesen.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.087
Sort of like
a Blutbad, but...

23:03.160 --> 23:04.207
No, no, no.

23:04.720 --> 23:06.006
This is not a Blutbad.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.289
Blutbaden are just one branch
of a pretty huge family tree.

23:09.360 --> 23:10.964
There's all kinds
of Canid Wesen,

23:11.040 --> 23:15.250
from the Russian, what, the
Volkodlak, to the Spanish Lob Hombre.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.808
This particular fellow is a Luison.
South American in origin.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.729
You can tell by the ears.
It's a dead giveaway.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.290
So you think
a Luison is involved?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.600
This woman's very wealthy.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.047
It could be her husband
is trying to drive her mad.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.004
He's doing a really good job. She's
about to be institutionalized.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.724
And you can't
tell her the truth, of course,

23:30.800 --> 23:33.201
because that'd sound even crazier
than what she already thinks.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.851
Are you sure the
husband is the Luison?

23:34.920 --> 23:35.921
No.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.240
And there's no way
I can find out.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.529
And if we don't find out, there's
nothing we can do for her.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.171
You want me to take a look?

23:42.240 --> 23:43.730
I hate to ask...
You didn't.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.122
I'm volunteering.
Griffin.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.490
Got it, thanks.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.282
Ava's doctor. She's awake.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.001
The one who drew those.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.167
Want me to come
with you guys?

23:56.240 --> 23:58.447
No. We should talk to
her first. Thank you.

24:01.680 --> 24:06.288
Ava, these are the
detectives I told you about.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.125
Are you here
to arrest me?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.201
No, ma'am.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.001
We have a few questions.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.242
I don't even remember
hitting that poor man.

24:18.880 --> 24:20.086
I'm so sorry.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.565
What do you remember?

24:23.920 --> 24:28.244
Dr. Bern said she talked
to you about what I see.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.564
- The wolf.
- Yes.

24:31.880 --> 24:35.248
I had one of my episodes.
He was there.

24:35.320 --> 24:36.924
In the house?
Yes.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.448
I tried to get away
from him,

24:42.240 --> 24:43.480
but he made me drink.

24:45.920 --> 24:49.003
And that's when the glass
broke, and then I ran outside,

24:49.880 --> 24:50.961
but he was already there.

24:51.840 --> 24:55.322
Gabriel tried to stop me,
but the wolf was in the car,

24:55.400 --> 24:56.561
and I had to get away.

24:56.680 --> 25:01.129
So one moment the wolf was in your
house, next thing he was in your car?

25:01.280 --> 25:02.930
He's everywhere.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.162
I can't get away
from him.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.603
I know I'm losing my mind.
Ava...

25:08.720 --> 25:09.801
lam.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.562
People don't see wolves,
they don't talk to wolves.

25:13.960 --> 25:14.961
What does he say to you?

25:15.040 --> 25:16.565
Is this really necessary?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.090
I want to tell them.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.726
He pretends to be kind,
but I know he's lying.

25:28.440 --> 25:32.968
Everyone tells me that the wolf isn't
real, that he's all in my head.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.011
But he's real to me.

25:35.520 --> 25:39.969
And I know he's trying to
kill me, and I know he will.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.726
I am not going
to let that happen.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.842
I think this is
enough for now.

25:47.160 --> 25:48.571
Thank you.

25:50.280 --> 25:51.486
Gabriel's record's clean.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.086
He has a medical degree from
the University of Sao Paulo,

25:54.160 --> 25:56.367
ran a private practice
in Rio for 15 years,

25:56.480 --> 25:58.642
and got his green card when he
married Ava eight months ago.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.009
He has no criminal
record in Brazil.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.282
At least not one that
we've been able to find.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.250
Ava's the sole heir to her
family's import-export business,

26:06.320 --> 26:07.481
Esperazar Brazil.

26:08.040 --> 26:11.726
I don't have an exact figure,
but it's worth about 50 mil.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.560
So we're thinking
Gabriel is involved

26:13.640 --> 26:14.880
because he has
the most to gain.

26:14.960 --> 26:18.328
Only problem is, Gabriel tried to
stop her, and when she drove away,

26:18.600 --> 26:19.567
the wolf was in her car.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.331
So either he's innocent,
or he's working with somebody.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.683
There's a
hearing tomorrow

26:24.760 --> 26:27.127
to determine whether Gabriel
gets control of her estate.

26:27.240 --> 26:29.811
So you have to confirm whether
or not Gabriel is a Luison.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.001
Yeah.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.241
You gonna use Theresa?

26:33.080 --> 26:34.206
She's a Grimm, right?

26:35.200 --> 26:36.884
She cut off Weston Steward's
head with a machete,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.327
and according to Sergeant Wu, she
didn't seem too bothered by it.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.445
I've been meaning to
talk to you about her.

26:41.640 --> 26:42.846
Yeah, well, look, Nick,

26:43.000 --> 26:44.968
I know she kept Steward from
putting another bullet in me,

26:45.080 --> 26:47.686
so I'm feeling a little
protective of her myself.

26:48.040 --> 26:52.728
I'm trying not to involve
her too much in what we do.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.042
She's still got
a lot to learn.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.845
I'm using Monroe on this one.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.281
You know, one of these days you're
gonna have to make a decision, Nick.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.442
Or you're gonna have to back
off on these investigations.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.443
Now, I personally think
that would be a mistake,

27:03.520 --> 27:05.727
but I'm not gonna tell you
how to live your life.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.764
You're also gonna have to
deal with Sergeant Wu

27:07.880 --> 27:10.565
because I don't want him getting any
closer to bringing Theresa down.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.290
So, no pressure there.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.811
We're
going to have to deal with Wu

27:18.880 --> 27:19.881
whether you're in or out.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.041
Burkhardt.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.447
Nick, it's Josh
Porter, Rolek's son.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.121
Josh?

27:28.320 --> 27:29.321
Where are you?

27:29.400 --> 27:30.401
Philadelphia.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.290
I just got back
to my dad's house,

27:32.360 --> 27:34.681
and there were people in
there, they chased me.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.444
Take it easy.
I can't take it easy.

27:36.520 --> 27:37.760
My dad's house is torn apart!

27:39.000 --> 27:41.162
I got away, I think.
What do I do?

27:41.840 --> 27:45.242
If this is because my dad...
Because he was a Grimm, right?

27:45.840 --> 27:47.888
Or maybe they are
looking for the key.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.250
Nick, this is a nightmare.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.923
I'm not like you, or my dad, or Trubel.
I'm normal!

27:54.000 --> 27:56.606
What am I supposed to do?

27:56.760 --> 27:58.125
Don't go back to your house.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.484
I should call the police?
No.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.330
It'll look like a robbery.

28:02.760 --> 28:06.560
And if you start
talking about Grimms and keys,

28:06.720 --> 28:08.210
they're just gonna throw you
in the drunk tank.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.169
You need to get out
of there. Now.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.970
My car's parked
at the house.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.326
Oh, God.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.045
They're coming back.

28:18.200 --> 28:20.487
Josh? Josh?

28:23.920 --> 28:25.081
Hello?

28:32.360 --> 28:34.727
I told you
not to go back.

28:37.640 --> 28:42.123
Whatever you do, don't stop
when you enter this room.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.561
Get to the door
on the other side.

28:44.800 --> 28:49.089
Remember, the door on the other
side, and you will be free.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.805
But how do I get
into this door?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.161
There's nowhere to open it.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.681
With me.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.007
I am the key.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.409
What do you mean,
you're the key?

29:42.840 --> 29:44.410
Mama.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.881
Diana?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.370
Oh, my God.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.561
Oh, my God. I've got you back.

29:55.120 --> 29:56.645
I've got you back at last.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.800
Diana.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.207
No!

30:18.400 --> 30:19.811
No!

30:22.400 --> 30:23.890
No!

30:33.400 --> 30:34.447
Sol know
what he looks like,

30:34.560 --> 30:36.005
but how am I supposed
to get into

30:36.080 --> 30:37.764
the judge's chambers
for this hearing?

30:37.840 --> 30:39.683
You don't. We'll be there.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.044
You stand outside.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.246
And when he comes out...

30:43.360 --> 30:44.361
I don't think
that's going to work.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.411
Even though the Luison has a
pretty distinct body odor,

30:47.480 --> 30:48.561
we're talking about
a courthouse here.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.961
That's too many people,
too many scents.

30:51.160 --> 30:54.209
It'd be better if you could get into
the house when he's at the hearing.

30:54.400 --> 30:56.880
Should be easy enough to tell if
a Luison's been there or not.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.287
Ava's at the hospital,
we'll be with Gabriel.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.000
No one will be home.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.321
Yeah?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.526
I'm here.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.928
Nice place.
It is.

31:16.440 --> 31:17.441
We good?

31:17.960 --> 31:20.122
I am looking at
Gabriel right now.

31:21.960 --> 31:23.962
We're good to go.
Copy that.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.484
Oh, yeah.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.531
Definitely.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.930
That is Luison.

32:43.720 --> 32:44.721
Monroe.

32:44.800 --> 32:47.121
You were supposed to tell me
when this guy was coming home!

32:47.200 --> 32:48.201
Yeah, we will.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.288
What do you mean,
you will? He is!

32:50.520 --> 32:52.170
He is what?
Home.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.731
No, he isn't.
He's here.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.325
I am looking
right at him.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.604
Yeah, so am I!

32:58.720 --> 33:00.085
What's going on?
It's Monroe.

33:00.160 --> 33:01.650
He says Gabriel's
already at the house.

33:01.800 --> 33:02.801
What's he
been drinking?

33:02.920 --> 33:03.967
I heard that.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.764
You can't be in two places at once.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.001
I gotta go.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.121
I don't know what to tell you, man.
That's the guy I saw.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.163
Well, then there's
gotta be two of them.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.321
Twins?

34:05.480 --> 34:06.811
Oh, my God.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.482
Of course, twins.

34:09.639 --> 34:10.721
We should have seen
that one coming.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.641
There were no siblings listed
in his immigration file.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.643
We're still waiting on records
from the Brazilian Federal Police.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.848
But now that we know
how they're doing it,

34:18.960 --> 34:22.282
how do we explain it to Ava, or
anyone else for that matter?

34:26.639 --> 34:28.324
- Masks.
- Right.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.641
People think Wesen have
been using masks for years.

34:30.719 --> 34:32.165
Yeah. I mean,
where do you think all

34:32.239 --> 34:33.844
those Halloween
ideas come from anyway?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.241
So we've gotta keep Ava
away from Gabriel.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.005
If she sees this Luison again,
she'll lose her mind for good.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.491
Or kill herself.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.688
So we need to get
masks to show her.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.126
Hopefully she believes this.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.202
Well, it's better
than the alternative.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.005
What if I see him again?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.050
What if he's waiting for me?

34:52.520 --> 34:54.841
The police checked
the entire house.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.844
You're safe.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.364
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm sorry, you're, um...

35:19.920 --> 35:21.251
You're Gabriel's twin, right?

35:27.080 --> 35:28.161
Luison.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.564
Matheus! Javier!

35:36.720 --> 35:38.131
One down, one to go.

35:38.240 --> 35:41.528
Julio?

35:45.560 --> 35:46.721
Julio?

35:49.480 --> 35:50.641
Julio?

35:58.240 --> 36:00.163
Matheus?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.689
What the hell happened?
I don't know.

36:09.240 --> 36:10.765
The idiot must have tripped.

36:10.920 --> 36:13.321
I am not an idiot.

36:13.440 --> 36:15.920
Well, you look like an idiot.
How could you trip out here?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.001
I was hit.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.286
Nobody move.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.723
Holy crap!

36:23.400 --> 36:24.640
That is a litter.

36:24.720 --> 36:25.881
I hope that's
all of them.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.205
Gabriel?

36:52.280 --> 36:54.328
Gabriel, where did you go?

36:59.240 --> 37:01.163
Gabriel, where are you?

37:04.760 --> 37:05.807
Ava?

37:06.680 --> 37:08.011
Where are you?

37:12.800 --> 37:14.165
Ava.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.403
It's not an exact match, but
it's close enough.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.567
We had to go to, what,
three different stores?

37:34.520 --> 37:35.601
Nice Woge.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.886
I don't understand.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.923
Yes, you do.

37:40.680 --> 37:43.684
You're a Luison, your
brothers are in the garage,

37:43.800 --> 37:46.246
and this is so against
the Wesen Council.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.564
You cannot prove anything.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.971
Oh, I think we can.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.487
They did all this for the money?

38:08.800 --> 38:09.847
My God.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.968
For six months they've been
trying to drive you crazy.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.367
You're not, by the way.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.565
They're monsters.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.325
Some people hide it well.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.163
Josh, where are you?
 On a bus.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.410
I don't know
what to do.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.130
I don't know
where to go.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.286
Is this about the key?

38:30.560 --> 38:32.244
I don't know. it could be.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.169
Well, I don't have
the damn key! You do.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.049
Yeah, well,
glad they don't know that.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.886
This Grimm thing
is ruining my life.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.161
You need to find someplace
safe and stay there.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.084
Well, where the hell is that?

38:57.880 --> 38:59.120
No.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.246
No,no,no,no.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.483
No!

39:05.920 --> 39:07.365
No!

39:16.120 --> 39:17.451
Had enough?

39:18.560 --> 39:19.846
I'll do anything.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.086
Just make it stop.

39:22.320 --> 39:23.845
What do you want from me?

39:30.160 --> 39:32.162
I want the same
thing you want.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.122
To get our child back.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.361
So it turned out
to be an actual litter!

39:43.080 --> 39:45.651
I got an awesome Willamette
Valley Pinot for ya.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.291
Haven't heard
a lot of that lately.

39:51.360 --> 39:55.206
Yeah, well, the spell of a
Hexenbiest does tend to

39:55.880 --> 39:57.882
put a damper on the good times.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.051
So does being a Grimm.

40:00.120 --> 40:01.281
Wow.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.161
Okay.

40:04.160 --> 40:06.162
We having a little down time?

40:07.640 --> 40:09.563
Yeah, sorry, I'm just trying
to figure this all out.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.961
Dude, come on,
it's a big decision.

40:12.720 --> 40:13.881
I don't know.

40:15.640 --> 40:19.440
I just don't want Juliette
to constantly have to worry

40:19.560 --> 40:21.005
about something bad
happening to me,

40:21.080 --> 40:23.162
or to her, or to one
of our friends.

40:24.720 --> 40:25.801
And?

40:26.680 --> 40:28.409
And the thought of

40:29.840 --> 40:32.844
just packing it up,
moving someplace new,

40:33.200 --> 40:35.248
starting a family,
that's very appealing.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.841
Hey, man,
if that's what you wanna do,

40:38.680 --> 40:41.081
do it. No regrets.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.521
The problem is,

40:50.400 --> 40:52.402
I liked being a Grimm, Monroe.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.610
Are you serious?

40:57.320 --> 40:58.731
You miss it?

41:00.360 --> 41:01.441
Yeah.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.122
And I'm pissed that it
was taken away from me.

41:06.080 --> 41:08.082
Maybe I didn't
want to admit to it,

41:08.480 --> 41:10.050
but I want it back.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.724
Ta-da!

41:13.160 --> 41:14.605
Wow. That smells so good! Mmm.

41:14.760 --> 41:15.841
I know.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.561
Here's to the chef.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.800
I just wanted to say thank
you to Monroe and Rosalee

41:23.960 --> 41:25.962
for putting aside
their honeymoon.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.926
It means a lot.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.525
Cheers.
Cheers.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.611
What is it?

41:47.720 --> 41:49.165
A Wolfsangel.

41:49.480 --> 41:50.641
It's Wesen.

41:51.320 --> 41:52.401
Why?

41:52.720 --> 41:54.290
It's because
we got married.

41:58.160 --> 41:59.446
You better
get back inside.

42:00.760 --> 42:01.921
I'll check the back.

42:03.240 --> 42:04.605
I'm ready.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.971
Ready for what?

42:08.640 --> 42:10.722
You need to be
a Grimm again.
