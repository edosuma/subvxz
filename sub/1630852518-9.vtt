00:27.277 --> 00:28.653
Hank Anchorman here,

00:28.737 --> 00:31.865
reporting on the monstrous
and mysterious destruction

00:31.948 --> 00:34.993
that happened downtown
in the early morning hours.

00:35.076 --> 00:38.288
Monstrous, because
look at the size of that hole!

00:38.371 --> 00:42.042
And mysterious, because all that was taken
was 4,000 candy bars,

00:42.125 --> 00:44.878
and one of those oversized
bean bag chairs.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.796
Hey, what's going on?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.923
Did you do something
in the lab last night,

00:49.007 --> 00:52.093
then trash the town for candy
and a giant bean bag chair?

00:52.177 --> 00:53.595
I wish!

00:53.678 --> 00:56.181
Huh. I can't believe
the town got destroyed,

00:56.264 --> 00:58.141
and it wasn't our fault.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.517
And the best part is,

00:59.601 --> 01:02.645
I don't have to be the one
to clean up that huge mess.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.855


01:04.481 --> 01:07.275
Hey, we need Johnny
to clean up a huge mess.

01:07.358 --> 01:10.653
And by Johnny, we mean Johnny X.

01:12.572 --> 01:17.285
It all started yesterday, when The General
presented his plans for…

01:17.368 --> 01:21.372
The Soldier of the Future!

01:21.456 --> 01:25.085
Which will be unstoppable,
like you see in the movies,

01:25.168 --> 01:28.505
only it won't be a movie,
it will be real life!

01:28.588 --> 01:30.131
<i> But then our scientists</i>

01:30.215 --> 01:33.218
<i>presented us</i>
<i>with an algorithmic simulation…</i>

01:33.301 --> 01:36.262
Once the Super-Soldier DNA
is released into your body,

01:36.346 --> 01:39.474
the muscle mass in your lower regions
will grow almost immediately,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.268
eventually working its way up to…

01:46.648 --> 01:47.774
Oh, dear.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.570
<i> We urged The General</i>
<i>to scrap the project</i>

01:52.654 --> 01:54.906
<i>after even more simulations failed.</i>

01:54.989 --> 01:57.033
<i>One where you get a huge butt…</i>

01:59.244 --> 02:01.788
<i> One that turns you</i>
<i>into a beast-thing</i>

02:01.871 --> 02:03.748
<i>that wants to take over the world…</i>

02:05.250 --> 02:06.584
<i> And, again…</i>

02:09.295 --> 02:12.382
Oh, come on. That's just a flesh wound!

02:13.424 --> 02:14.968
That's when we told The General

02:15.051 --> 02:19.472
nobody on the base would volunteer
for the Super Soldier program.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.598
Then what happened?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.392
The worst part.

02:22.475 --> 02:26.020
Ha! I'll show them
there's nothing to be afraid of.

02:40.952 --> 02:44.873
So, it was The General
that destroyed the town.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.749
And candy is the only thing

02:46.833 --> 02:50.837
that can provide a massive calorie intake
to power his massive state.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.630
And if we don't stop him soon,

02:52.714 --> 02:57.218
he could become an evil villain beast
that tries to take over the world.

02:57.302 --> 03:01.598
However, he can, technically,
be defeated by doing nothing.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.142
Great! How does that happen?

03:04.225 --> 03:06.394
Well, according to the simulation,

03:06.477 --> 03:09.147
if we don't stop him in four hours, he…

03:13.943 --> 03:15.403
Yeah, we gotta save him.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.531
We've picked up
a large radioactive reading

03:18.615 --> 03:20.283
in the Porkbelly Forest.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.285
We think it might be The General.

03:22.368 --> 03:26.122
So, you need us to crush the biggest
and strongest soldier in history,

03:26.205 --> 03:28.917
but not crush him too much,
'cause it's The General?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.001
Correct.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.669
Come on, we love The General.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.673
And, with our mutant powers,
we can totally crush him just enough.

03:35.757 --> 03:39.052
And he doesn't get super evil
for another three hours.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.305
And he doesn't blow up
until an hour after that.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.389
Right!

03:43.473 --> 03:46.184
There's no way a Super Soldier
can beat a super--

03:46.267 --> 03:49.687


03:50.313 --> 03:52.106
Wait, you can fly.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.983
Oh, right. Hop on, Johnny!

03:56.653 --> 03:59.239
OK, let's just find The General,
and then--

04:00.490 --> 04:02.575
-Found him.
-Nice setup.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.204
Endless chocolate and
a squishy throne in the middle of nature?

04:06.287 --> 04:08.373
Hm. It's perfection.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.750
But now we have to save him
before that bear gets him first.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.048


04:18.758 --> 04:21.386
-OK, that's clearly not a problem.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.723
Sorry, General,
but your life is in danger…

04:26.975 --> 04:30.812
and we have to bring you to Area 51.1
and change you back.

04:30.895 --> 04:34.983
And, don't forget,
nothing can beat our mutant powers!

04:36.818 --> 04:39.654
And if you resist, we will battle you.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.790
Oh, man, I feel bad.

04:50.873 --> 04:54.085
It sounds like The General is getting
his Super Soldier butt kicked.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.800
Uh-oh.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.805
OK… we're clearly going to need
something stronger

05:05.888 --> 05:07.390
to defeat the Beast-General.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.684
What about a wooden stake?

05:09.767 --> 05:11.936
Johnny, he's not a vampire.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.272
Ooh! Something silver.

05:14.355 --> 05:16.024
That's for werewolves.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.651
Well, what about
a mutant power upgrade

05:18.735 --> 05:20.862
like super lightning hands?

05:22.071 --> 05:23.156
That could work.

05:35.209 --> 05:36.419
Uh, General,

05:36.502 --> 05:38.004
we want to stress again

05:38.087 --> 05:40.298
that we mean you no harm.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.842
But come with us now, or else.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.971
Or else what?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.307
Or else… this!

05:57.940 --> 06:00.568
That does not sound fun.

06:00.651 --> 06:05.573
Uh, I hope The General won't be mad at us
when he's the normal General again.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.455
I'll start the plane.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.709
-OK. We're running out of time.

06:17.794 --> 06:22.256
There's got to be some mutant power
that can stop the Beast-General.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.845
What about giant massive arms
that we can summon with a cool phrase?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.680
Ooh, and a pair for me, too!

06:30.681 --> 06:32.475
It's worth a shot.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.279
Thunder Arms… amass!

06:48.658 --> 06:49.617
Huh.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.127
Arms were too big, huh?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.420
Just get us back to the lab.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.342
We've got one more shot.

07:06.425 --> 07:08.302
If you don't stop him this time,

07:08.386 --> 07:11.848
his mutation will reach
"evil villain take over the world" levels!

07:11.931 --> 07:14.267
Then I guess Johnny X has to reach

07:14.350 --> 07:17.437
"super hero save the world" levels.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.651
Look, we get it.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.736
Who would want to leave
this sweet setup?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.239
Frankly, we are super jealous, and--

07:31.451 --> 07:33.286
Uh-oh, his eyes have turned red.

07:33.369 --> 07:36.372
But we can now turn… invisible!

07:39.917 --> 07:43.963
Yes! Sounds like Inviso-Johnny X
and Super Dukey are winning!

07:49.010 --> 07:50.261
Nope.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.602
Wait, where's he going?

07:58.186 --> 08:01.981
Hank Anchorman here
with a newsflash update.

08:02.064 --> 08:07.445
Area 51.1 has just been taken over
by a chocolate-eating Beast-Man Thing!

08:07.528 --> 08:11.491
Yup, he's reached the "evil beast
taking over the world" stage.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.575


08:12.658 --> 08:14.827
Now that I have
Army's arsenal,

08:14.911 --> 08:18.748
all are to swear their allegiance to me.

08:18.831 --> 08:21.959
You have one hour!

08:22.919 --> 08:25.588
Oh, no, he's in the launch room!

08:25.671 --> 08:27.798
But he's not gonna launch anything
in an hour,

08:27.882 --> 08:31.302
'cause again, he blows up in half an hour.

08:31.385 --> 08:34.847
Well, that's reassuring, I guess.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.183
Wait, don't tell me
you're actually considering

08:37.266 --> 08:38.851
just waiting for him to blow up?

08:38.935 --> 08:42.146
Johnny, we've tried everything,
and by we, I mean you.

08:42.230 --> 08:46.234
And he is trying
to take over the world, so…

08:47.276 --> 08:51.155
Actually, we haven't tried everything.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.659
Hurry, before he hears us.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.370
Johnny, even if turning
into a Super Soldier

08:57.453 --> 08:59.372
gives you the power to stop him…

08:59.455 --> 09:01.791
It's you who now becomes evil
in four hours

09:01.874 --> 09:03.793
that we now have to stop.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.088
No, because my sisters
are at the controls this time.

09:07.171 --> 09:10.216
And only his body will become
super like The General,

09:10.299 --> 09:11.968
but not his mind.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.011
We're such geniuses.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.488
Surrender!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.740
Ooh, my voice sounds funny.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.867
But cool! Very cool.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.621
Remember, Johnny, don't hurt him too bad!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.081
Oh, right.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.839
But you now only have 30 seconds
to stop him, or he blows up!

09:52.383 --> 09:53.759
Got it.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.639
You… have to stop,
or you… are going to blow up!

10:00.308 --> 10:04.186
Nothing can stop Super Soldier!

10:04.270 --> 10:07.732
But Johnny, you're a Super Soldier
and Johnny X.

10:07.815 --> 10:08.941
Oh, yeah!

10:11.068 --> 10:12.236
Hurry, Johnny!

10:13.821 --> 10:16.782
Thunder Arms, amass!

10:23.664 --> 10:25.541
I was invisible. Now!

10:33.549 --> 10:38.554
Uh, apologies, everyone,
for me being a Beast-thing,

10:38.638 --> 10:42.892
and, uh, thank you, Johnny,
for saving me by kicking my butt.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.229
OK, little massive brother,
your turn in the dome.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.775
What? But I've still got three hours
before I turn evil.

10:50.858 --> 10:52.735
Yeah, so?

10:54.612 --> 10:58.324
Mm-mm! Oh, this really is a great setup.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.201
Perfection!

11:00.284 --> 11:01.619
How much time I got left?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.871
You have another hour.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.498
Cool.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.504
Uh-uh! Stop roaring,
and I'll give you some.
