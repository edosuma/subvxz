00:14.442 --> 00:18.111
Amethyst?
Pearl?

00:18.113 --> 00:19.612
Garnet!

00:19.614 --> 00:22.215
Where are they?

00:22.217 --> 00:23.283
Whoa.

00:35.130 --> 00:37.297
Ew!

00:37.966 --> 00:39.666
Cool!

00:39.668 --> 00:42.569
Who-o-o-o-oa!

00:44.172 --> 00:46.606
I'm out.
Whoo-hoo!

00:46.608 --> 00:48.975
Okay, where is everybody?

00:48.977 --> 00:50.977
Got to find 'em, got to find
'em, got to find 'em.

00:50.979 --> 00:52.579
Oh!

00:52.581 --> 00:55.048
Uh, hello?
Are you okay?

00:59.688 --> 01:03.556
Great!
This is just perfect!

01:03.558 --> 01:07.193
- Uh... do you need any help?
- No!

01:07.195 --> 01:10.496
I mean... don't look at me!
Just go away.

01:10.498 --> 01:15.201
- Wha...? Hmph.
- Hey, wait! You're out!

01:15.203 --> 01:17.236
How did you get past the field?

01:17.238 --> 01:20.673
- Oh, uh, I just kind of ...
- Wait! No, no, no, no, wait.

01:21.343 --> 01:24.110
That's... okay?

01:26.348 --> 01:29.616
What's going on?

01:32.153 --> 01:35.088
- Somebody's singing.
- Sapphire.

01:35.090 --> 01:38.958
Let me out of here!
Please, I need to find Sapphire.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.461
Is she your friend?
I'm looking for my friends, too.

01:41.463 --> 01:43.463
She's all alone!
I need to find her!

01:43.465 --> 01:45.999
Don't worry.
We'll find our friends.

01:46.968 --> 01:50.737
A-A-And we'll d-do it
together-er-er!

01:50.739 --> 01:52.572
Whoa! Wait for me!

01:53.608 --> 01:56.042
Hey! Uh, my
name's Steven, by the way.

01:56.044 --> 01:58.044
- What's yours?
- Quiet!

01:58.046 --> 02:00.580
I can't see.

02:00.582 --> 02:03.282
- This way!
- A-a-ah!

02:03.284 --> 02:06.719
- How many more gems are trapped here?
- Don't know. Don't care.

02:07.522 --> 02:09.389
She stopped singing.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.025
Sapphire!

02:18.515 --> 02:24.387
- Oh, it's just you.
- Lapis!

02:24.389 --> 02:27.557
- Lapis, I can get you out.
- Stop!

02:27.559 --> 02:31.194
- It's okay. I can ...
- No! I don't want your help.

02:31.196 --> 02:34.831
Things are bad enough as it is.
I've already made too much trouble.

02:34.833 --> 02:38.334
Once we get back to homeworld, they're
going to decide what to do with us.

02:39.370 --> 02:42.138
- I don't have time for this!
- Wait!

02:42.140 --> 02:44.340
Steven, whatever you're
doing, just stop.

02:44.342 --> 02:47.276
If we do everything they say,
they might go easy on us.

02:47.278 --> 02:49.645
But they're... mean.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.348
They hurt my friends.
They hurt my face.

02:52.350 --> 02:56.652
- They've got you here in prison!
- That's why we can't fight them.

02:56.654 --> 03:01.324
That's why
we have to fight them!

03:01.526 --> 03:03.659
I'll come back for you.

03:08.977 --> 03:12.604
We can't leave yet!

03:13.798 --> 03:16.505
The whole point of coming here
was to check on the cluster.

03:16.507 --> 03:20.376
Stop singing!
Rose Quartz takes priority.

03:20.378 --> 03:24.245
Get back to the bridge and
set a course for homeworld.

03:24.280 --> 03:29.202
<i>"Go to Earth," they said.
"It'll be easy," they said.</i>

03:37.362 --> 03:39.528
Hey.
I like your song.

03:39.530 --> 03:42.231
- Are you Sapphire?
- You escaped.

03:42.233 --> 03:45.668
Of course.

03:45.670 --> 03:49.505
Co-Come o-o-on.
It's sa-a-afe.

03:49.507 --> 03:53.242
- Thank you, Steven.
- Yo-o-ou're welcome.

03:53.244 --> 03:54.644
<i>Sapphire!</i>

03:54.646 --> 03:57.413
- Come on!
- Whoa!

04:00.451 --> 04:02.064
Ruby!

04:04.289 --> 04:08.691
- Did they hurt you?
- No, no. I'm okay. Did they hurt you?

04:08.693 --> 04:11.260
- Who cares?
- I do.

04:20.404 --> 04:24.173
- Steven, thank you!
- Garnet!

04:24.175 --> 04:26.742
- You're a fusion?
- Oh, I-I'm sorry.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.278
We didn't want you meeting us
here like this.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.448
Well, did I make
a good first impression?

04:32.450 --> 04:36.585
Oh, Steven.
We already love you.

04:36.587 --> 04:38.120
<i>Where is she?!</i>

04:38.122 --> 04:39.255
It's Jasper.

04:39.257 --> 04:41.657
Steven, find the others and
get to the control bridge.

04:41.659 --> 04:43.326
But I don't know where they are.

04:47.298 --> 04:49.131
Future vision.

04:49.133 --> 04:52.134
Wait. Are you gonna be able
to beat her on your own?

04:52.136 --> 04:55.671
It's okay, Steven.
I'm never alone.

04:55.673 --> 04:57.743
Hmm.

04:58.810 --> 05:01.577
Oh, great.
You're both out?

05:01.579 --> 05:04.420
And you're fused again?
Why?

05:04.455 --> 05:08.517
Fusion is just a cheap tactic
to make weak gems stronger.

05:08.519 --> 05:10.519
<i>Quit embarrassing yourselves!</i>

05:10.521 --> 05:12.455
<i>I've seen what you really are.</i>

a fusion all the time!

08:09.327 --> 08:12.428
- You met Ruby and Sapphire?
- Oh, no!

08:12.430 --> 08:15.664
We were going to introduce you.
Garnet, your plan.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.599
We were waiting for
your birthday.

08:17.601 --> 08:20.905
We can still do it.
I'll just pretend I didn't know.

08:27.422 --> 08:31.513
Don't think you've won.

08:31.515 --> 08:34.482
You only beat me
'cause you're a fusion.

08:34.485 --> 08:36.618
If I had someone to fuse
with, I'd ...

08:36.620 --> 08:38.654
Huh?

08:43.193 --> 08:44.593
Come here, brat!

08:44.595 --> 08:48.330
- Aw, don't fly off so soon.
- Lapis!

08:48.332 --> 08:50.821
Lapis, listen.
Fuse with me!

08:50.856 --> 08:52.634
- What?
- How long did they keep you

08:52.636 --> 08:56.057
trapped here on this miserable
hunk of rock?

08:57.341 --> 09:00.376
<i>These gems ... they're traitors
to their homeworld.</i>

09:00.378 --> 09:03.011
They kept you prisoner.
They used you!

09:03.013 --> 09:06.682
This is your chance to take revenge!

09:06.684 --> 09:10.552
Come on.
Just say "yes."

09:10.554 --> 09:13.634
Lapis, don't do it.

09:24.834 --> 09:26.896
Noooo!

09:54.342 --> 09:57.566
Huh? What?!

10:03.407 --> 10:07.943
- What are you doing?!
- I'm done being everyone's prisoner.

10:07.945 --> 10:09.945
Now you're my prisoner!

10:09.947 --> 10:13.415
<i>And I'm never letting you go!</i>

10:14.852 --> 10:16.819
No!

10:18.856 --> 10:20.088
Lapis!

10:20.090 --> 10:24.860
Let's stay on this miserable
planet together!

10:29.732 --> 10:34.036
Yikes. They are
really bad for each other.

10:39.643 --> 10:41.710
Uh... hello?

10:41.712 --> 10:44.121
<i>Steven, I got your message.
Are you okay?</i>

10:44.156 --> 10:47.714
<i>What's going on?
Steven?</i>
