00:09.385 --> 00:10.598
<i>Previously on "Greenleaf"...</i>

00:10.600 --> 00:11.796
You just stop right there.

00:11.798 --> 00:13.992
We have a search-and-seizure
warrant, ma'am. Please step aside.

00:13.994 --> 00:17.332
Jacob transferred $200,000
of church funds

00:17.334 --> 00:20.065
into what turned out
to be a personal account.

00:20.067 --> 00:22.365
It's Connie. She's talking
with Phillip Demars again

00:22.367 --> 00:24.599
about us joining Harmony and Hope.

00:24.601 --> 00:26.199
I'll see that doesn't happen.

00:26.201 --> 00:28.132
Connie's told me she's
talked to you in the past

00:28.134 --> 00:29.399
about stepping up.

00:29.401 --> 00:31.299
These folks want change, Grace.

00:31.301 --> 00:33.165
You want me to take over the church?

00:33.167 --> 00:34.899
This is an opportunity.

00:34.901 --> 00:38.099
Harmony and Hope is a gigantic deal.

00:38.101 --> 00:40.632
Bob Whitmore, he is one
of the richest men in America.

00:40.634 --> 00:43.765
What we're gonna need
from you this year, Grace,

00:43.767 --> 00:45.199
is your voice,

00:45.201 --> 00:48.699
a voice that can unify this congregation.

00:48.701 --> 00:50.665
Are you ready to be that voice?

00:50.667 --> 00:53.699
You've been beating me down
with your holy superiority.

00:53.701 --> 00:55.399
You are just another sinner.

00:55.401 --> 00:56.632
I know that, James.

00:56.634 --> 00:58.865
Aaron and I took a blood test.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.232
Lionel's my father.

01:00.234 --> 01:03.165
You are my daughter,
and you always will be.

01:03.167 --> 01:06.099
This family, this faith,
and we ask that you let it

01:06.101 --> 01:08.465
give us strength and sustenance

01:08.467 --> 01:10.099
so that we can take back what is ours.

Good morning, Calvary!

02:01.834 --> 02:03.432
Good morning.

02:03.434 --> 02:06.465
Wasn't that a wonderful
performance we just saw, huh?

02:08.267 --> 02:10.650
So much energy, wow!

02:11.234 --> 02:13.099
And what a blessing it is
to be looking down

02:13.101 --> 02:15.932
on all these
beautiful faces this morning...

02:16.442 --> 02:18.332
- Ain't that the truth
- ...And hats!

02:18.334 --> 02:20.965
so many hats!

02:20.967 --> 02:22.465
I don't think I've ever seen

02:22.467 --> 02:25.665
so many beautiful hats in one room.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.737
Yeah!

02:26.739 --> 02:31.999
Anyway, I'm Bob Whitmore,
president of Harmony and Hope,

02:32.001 --> 02:35.999
and I just want to say
welcome to the family.

02:40.401 --> 02:44.065
When Connie Sykes, your amazing
Deacon board president,

02:44.067 --> 02:45.965
first called me and Phil Demars...

02:45.967 --> 02:47.632
that's Phil right there.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.865
He's our southeastern
conference minister.

02:49.867 --> 02:53.265
He's gonna be officing here
for a while, yes.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.567
Well, I got to tell you,

02:57.334 --> 02:59.233
we were over the moon.

02:59.734 --> 03:02.365
We've been hearing
about Calvary for years,

03:02.367 --> 03:05.099
all the great things you're doing.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.965
And it was more than one time
I said to Phil,

03:06.967 --> 03:08.999
"Phil, we got to get in on that, buddy."

03:09.001 --> 03:10.405
you remember that, Phil?

03:11.267 --> 03:12.765
And I bet that's just what he said, too.

03:12.767 --> 03:13.799
Shh.

03:13.801 --> 03:15.332
"We got to get in on that money."

03:15.334 --> 03:16.765
- but then...
- James, please.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.495
- ...You elected...
- Keep your voice down, please.

03:18.497 --> 03:21.699
...To join us, and here we are,

03:21.701 --> 03:23.932
and we are so excited.

03:23.934 --> 03:25.599
But I'm not the one

03:25.601 --> 03:28.132
that you came
to hear jabber this morning.

03:28.134 --> 03:30.865
- You came to hear the word!
- Yeah!

03:30.867 --> 03:32.467
Amen, and so did I.

03:35.467 --> 03:38.632
So let's get God's servant
up here to preach it.

03:38.634 --> 03:39.834
Yes, yes!

03:39.836 --> 03:46.399
You all know her and love her,
your new interim head Pastor,

03:46.401 --> 03:48.404
reverend Grace Greenleaf!

03:48.406 --> 03:49.499
Give it up!

03:56.301 --> 03:57.899
Keep it short.

04:02.912 --> 04:04.165
Harmony and Hope.

04:59.701 --> 05:07.702
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:11.467 --> 05:13.732
We haven't seen you in church
for a while, child.

05:13.734 --> 05:15.299
Where have you been?

05:15.301 --> 05:17.232
Getting ready to leave for school.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.275
But September is so far away.

05:19.867 --> 05:20.932
It's called precollege.

05:20.934 --> 05:23.199
Ah, in a rush to grow up.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.565
And you sounded just like Bishop today.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.199
Well, he is my father, after all.

05:29.201 --> 05:31.865
And a proud one indeed.

05:31.867 --> 05:33.650
Thank you, Daddy.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.499
Would you be a dear and help me
find the coffee and cookies?

05:37.501 --> 05:38.832
They moved it.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.365
Everything's different.

05:40.367 --> 05:42.299
Of course, Ms. Morton. I'll help you.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.832
Crippled, old thing.

05:46.834 --> 05:49.365
She can't even face us
because she voted against us.

05:49.367 --> 05:51.799
James, please don't make a scene.

05:51.801 --> 05:53.650
How you two holding up, huh?

05:54.534 --> 05:57.632
I feel like a ghost
moving unseen in a house

05:57.634 --> 05:59.400
that I lovingly built.

06:01.001 --> 06:02.632
- Mama.
- Mm-hmm?

06:02.634 --> 06:04.192
You look like you have notes.

06:05.634 --> 06:11.265
Well, your sermon was rather concise.

06:11.267 --> 06:12.747
Bob told me to keep it short.

06:12.749 --> 06:15.232
- Hmph.
- And you felt required to obey.

06:15.234 --> 06:17.265
With any luck, they'll be
out of here in a year.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.399
I'm gonna give that
Connie Sykes an earful.

06:19.401 --> 06:20.732
No, Daddy.

06:20.734 --> 06:22.532
We're gonna stick to the plan, remember?

06:22.534 --> 06:24.399
We're gonna play nice
with Harmony and Hope,

06:24.401 --> 06:25.799
and we are gonna win back the hearts

06:25.801 --> 06:27.499
and minds of this congregation,

06:27.501 --> 06:29.332
and then, when Bob makes me

06:29.334 --> 06:32.299
permanent head Pastor
after this interim year,

06:32.301 --> 06:35.165
we'll take a vote to leave H and H,

06:35.167 --> 06:36.499
and I will hand the church over to mama.

06:36.501 --> 06:39.732
If there's a church worthy
of the name to hand over.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.665
How many folks do you think
just keep coming back week

06:41.667 --> 06:44.000
after week for a seance?

06:44.334 --> 06:46.399
Look. There's Connie Sykes now.

06:46.401 --> 06:48.032
- No. James.
- Excuse me.

06:48.034 --> 06:49.332
What? What?

06:49.334 --> 06:51.132
No, James. Listen to me.

06:51.134 --> 06:53.065
Grace is right.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.532
What?

06:56.801 --> 06:59.432
Nothing. I'm just gonna sit here
and watch the two of you

06:59.434 --> 07:01.499
suddenly thick as thieves.

07:01.501 --> 07:03.065
You go stomp over there

07:03.067 --> 07:04.765
the first Sunday of the new regime

07:04.767 --> 07:06.299
demanding your church back?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.275
Well, it'll be churlish.

07:09.801 --> 07:11.165
Fine.

07:11.167 --> 07:14.399
I will submit to your
feminine wisdom this time.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.195
For now, but not happily.

07:17.197 --> 07:19.465
- Okay. I'm gonna go meet with Phil.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.467 --> 07:21.032
Alright. Well, listen.

07:21.034 --> 07:23.432
Uh, don't forget about Charity and Jacob.

07:23.434 --> 07:25.233
I won't, dad. I won't.

07:26.601 --> 07:28.900
Lord, I hope she's up to this.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.999
She's the only one in the family
that the deacons

07:32.001 --> 07:34.465
will sign on for, but I...
I... I share your concern.

07:34.467 --> 07:37.233
Stay here. I'll be right back.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.399
Where are you going?

07:39.401 --> 07:42.233
To pay my respects to the dead.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.399
That woman was on fire.

07:44.401 --> 07:46.599
Yes, she was.

07:46.601 --> 07:49.632
Lady Mae, God is good.

07:49.634 --> 07:51.865
All the time.

07:51.867 --> 07:54.365
Bob was just saying, Mae,
what a wonderful sermon

07:54.367 --> 07:55.799
Grace delivered.

07:55.801 --> 07:57.565
Was that a sermon?

07:57.567 --> 08:01.365
Well, it seemed more like
a minister's minute,

08:01.367 --> 08:03.232
like the ones
I heard on the radio as a child.

08:04.301 --> 08:05.999
I knew you'd think it was short.

08:06.001 --> 08:07.832
Well, I wouldn't say short, Bob.

08:07.834 --> 08:11.432
Uh... Insufficient.

08:11.434 --> 08:14.499
Well, the offering certainly
was sufficient.

08:14.501 --> 08:18.465
Do you know it would never occur
to me to use money

08:18.467 --> 08:21.832
as a metric when measuring
things of the spirit?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.865
It's not just about money.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.953
Grace got the folks out the door on time.

08:25.955 --> 08:28.589
- Yes, she did.
- Oh, so that's the new goal

08:28.614 --> 08:29.965
around here, huh?

08:29.967 --> 08:31.832
To make sure the trains
are running on time?

08:31.834 --> 08:35.567
Well, did anybody ask Jesus about that?

08:35.900 --> 08:37.365
I would like to try

08:37.366 --> 08:39.332
- fitting in a third service.
- Mm.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.932
I think the finance committee
would like that, too.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.965
- Mm.
- The struggle is real.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.532
Plus, on any given Sunday,

08:45.534 --> 08:48.399
we have thousands of members
all over the world

08:48.401 --> 08:51.665
traveling for business
or pleasure who like to know...

08:51.667 --> 08:52.965
they've told us this.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.865
They like to know, no matter
which H and H church

08:55.867 --> 08:57.999
they walk into, what they're gonna get.

08:58.001 --> 08:59.332
Like McDonald's.

08:59.334 --> 09:02.865
Like the Lord himself
who's the same yesterday,

09:02.867 --> 09:04.232
today, and tomorrow.

09:04.234 --> 09:06.665
You know, Bob, I really don't
want to belabor this,

09:06.667 --> 09:08.865
especially since it's Sunday.

09:08.867 --> 09:13.565
You know, when I try to restrain
myself from any full-on warfare,

09:13.567 --> 09:17.132
but there are two things
that human beings do together

09:17.134 --> 09:19.465
that's best done slowly.

09:19.467 --> 09:20.983
Mm-hmm.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.332
Preaching is one of them.

09:24.334 --> 09:25.817
Mae.

09:26.494 --> 09:28.758
I'm all for long sermons.

09:31.280 --> 09:36.245
Made quite a few of them myself,
but I also run a business.

09:36.270 --> 09:39.568
Now, if you two lovely
young ladies will excuse me,

09:39.601 --> 09:41.942
I think I'd better call home.

09:48.053 --> 09:50.018
I don't know what you think
you're doing chatting him up

09:50.020 --> 09:52.651
like that, but make no mistake.

09:52.653 --> 09:56.685
Neither I or any of the other
deacons care a whit

09:56.687 --> 09:59.318
that the Bishop gave you the church.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.385
It wasn't his to give,

10:01.387 --> 10:03.885
and no one wants to see you running it...

10:03.887 --> 10:08.085
not now, not next year, not ever.

10:11.553 --> 10:13.111
Oh, Connie.

10:14.187 --> 10:15.985
What do you want to talk about now?

10:19.253 --> 10:20.851
Nothing.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.442
So, we're good to go?

10:32.087 --> 10:33.385
Almost.

10:33.387 --> 10:36.985
I saw in your proposal, Grace,
one thing... two, really,

10:36.987 --> 10:40.650
that I think Bob might have trouble with.

10:42.987 --> 10:44.442
Okay.

10:44.820 --> 10:46.525
Your brother and sister,

10:47.287 --> 10:50.451
installing them as associate pastors.

10:50.453 --> 10:52.400
Bob's not gonna go for that.

10:52.687 --> 10:54.851
Your brother barely avoided
being charged with fraud

10:54.853 --> 10:56.525
over at Triumph.

10:57.053 --> 10:59.650
He was framed by Basie Skanks.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.518
And as far as your sister, Charity...

11:01.520 --> 11:03.185
40,000 followers on soundcloud...

11:03.187 --> 11:04.551
- Grace...
- ...Th...

11:04.553 --> 11:06.551
...She almost got herself
arrested for kidnapping

11:06.553 --> 11:08.233
in Florida.

11:08.720 --> 11:10.985
Look, it is important to me
to give my brother

11:10.987 --> 11:14.817
and sister a place
in the structure of this church.

11:16.353 --> 11:18.518
Important to you or your parents?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.650
Because it's not important to us,

11:20.987 --> 11:24.185
and no one in the pews is clamoring.

11:26.187 --> 11:28.851
Okay, so maybe they don't
have to be associates.

11:28.853 --> 11:30.651
Maybe we call them
assistants or adjuncts.

11:30.653 --> 11:31.818
I don't care.

11:31.820 --> 11:35.851
Grace, it's never gonna happen.

11:43.253 --> 11:45.518
Ah, so sorry I couldn't be there, Judy,

11:45.520 --> 11:46.818
but you know how important it is

11:46.820 --> 11:47.951
to get a buy-in from...

11:47.953 --> 11:51.418
Oh, Bishop Greenleaf, hey.

11:52.887 --> 11:56.351
Uh, sorry, I... I...
Circulation problem, my feet.

11:56.353 --> 11:57.951
You got a second?

11:57.953 --> 12:00.218
For you, Bishop, of course.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.518
Okay, Judy.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.651
You tell that little man
his grandpa loves him, okay?

12:04.653 --> 12:05.983
Bye-bye.

12:06.853 --> 12:08.585
Sorry I've invaded.

12:08.587 --> 12:09.751
My battery died.

12:09.753 --> 12:12.108
- I needed somewhere to p...
- don't apologize.

12:12.587 --> 12:14.051
What did you want to talk about?

12:14.053 --> 12:16.151
Mike Evans was a friend of mine.

12:16.153 --> 12:19.118
Mike Evans, uh... Sorry.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.551
- I... I don't...
- He was the Pastor

12:20.553 --> 12:23.551
for the Jericho faith fellowship
in Galveston.

12:23.553 --> 12:26.251
Oh, yeah. That's one of our churches.

12:26.253 --> 12:28.151
But it wasn't always.

12:28.153 --> 12:29.885
You and Phil tried for years

12:29.887 --> 12:32.108
to get him to hand that church over,

12:32.453 --> 12:35.385
but he wasn't interested, so you...

12:35.387 --> 12:38.918
you hired a P.I. To look
into his private life,

12:38.920 --> 12:41.451
learned he acquired
an addiction to pain medication

12:41.453 --> 12:44.351
that he was taking for his back
after an injury he sustained

12:44.353 --> 12:47.192
while building houses
for the poor after Katrina.

12:47.653 --> 12:50.818
And then you shared
that information with his board,

12:50.820 --> 12:52.785
and they had him removed.

12:52.787 --> 12:56.618
Within six months,
that church became H and H,

12:56.620 --> 12:58.942
and Mike Evans is dead.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.385
Doesn't sound like H and H.

13:01.387 --> 13:03.851
Oh, it sounds just like H and H.

13:03.853 --> 13:05.851
What it doesn't sound like is God.

13:09.953 --> 13:12.251
Well, I'm glad we were there
to pick up the pieces

13:12.253 --> 13:14.858
after things went south for your friend.

13:15.287 --> 13:17.551
It's not good when congregations suffer

13:17.553 --> 13:19.817
for the sins of their leaders.

13:21.853 --> 13:23.442
Or is it?

13:23.987 --> 13:25.551
Maybe you have a different take on this.

13:25.553 --> 13:26.718
If you do, I'd...

13:26.720 --> 13:28.385
- Bob.
- ...I'd love to... what?

13:29.920 --> 13:32.192
I don't know what you're doing here,

13:32.953 --> 13:36.218
or why Calvary is suddenly
so important to you,

13:36.220 --> 13:40.018
or how you weaseled your way in,
but I'm gonna find out,

13:40.020 --> 13:44.251
and when I do, you're gonna
watch your whole magic carpet

13:44.253 --> 13:47.751
of a denomination dissolve
underneath you like smoke.

13:50.187 --> 13:52.233
And you're gonna fall, boy.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.518
You're gonna fall hard and fast.

13:55.520 --> 13:57.233
You know what, James?

13:58.820 --> 14:00.451
Your days are numbered.

14:02.787 --> 14:05.285
I'm gonna pray the Lord releases you

14:05.287 --> 14:07.385
from this spirit of resentment.

14:07.387 --> 14:09.518
Can't be good for your heart.

14:09.520 --> 14:12.918
Oh, and, uh, your ex-wife
found me after church.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.785
What a spitfire she is.

14:15.787 --> 14:18.233
How did you let her get away?

14:19.587 --> 14:20.885
Thanks for the charge.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.551
Hmm.

14:45.653 --> 14:47.318
<i> Grace.</i>

14:47.320 --> 14:48.918
Aaron, hey. What's going on?

14:48.920 --> 14:49.985
<i>Not much,</i>

14:49.987 --> 14:51.085
just here at the office

14:51.087 --> 14:53.218
getting some work done on a Sunday.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.418
You know, Calvary's technically
open and inclusive

14:55.420 --> 14:57.618
now that we joined H and H.

14:57.620 --> 14:59.317
You and Kevin should come visit.

15:00.120 --> 15:04.251
Boy, they really must've paid
off Connie Sykes big time, huh?

15:04.253 --> 15:06.318
That's just a rumor.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.275
But, yeah.

15:08.987 --> 15:10.608
So, what's up, counselor?

15:11.453 --> 15:12.751
How'd church go?

15:12.753 --> 15:16.218
<i>Phil said no to Jacob and Charity.</i>

15:16.220 --> 15:18.118
Oh. I'm sorry.

15:18.120 --> 15:19.351
Yeah.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.851
<i>You knew he might not say yes.</i>

15:20.853 --> 15:22.285
Yeah, I kn...

15:22.287 --> 15:24.318
I just wanted to be able to
give them something, you know?

15:24.320 --> 15:27.451
Grace, trying to pay them off with jobs

15:27.453 --> 15:28.918
isn't that different from your mother

15:28.920 --> 15:30.518
keeping this all a secret.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.785
What? It's completely different.

15:32.787 --> 15:36.618
No, it's just another way
to smooth things over.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.018
You know, make it seem
like nothing's changed

15:39.020 --> 15:41.650
when really change
might be what has to happen.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.358
<i>Grace.</i>

15:45.020 --> 15:46.985
<i>Grace? You still there?</i>

15:46.987 --> 15:48.351
Yeah.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.318
I'm just dealing with the fact

15:51.320 --> 15:53.718
that my little brother just schooled me.

16:04.787 --> 16:07.518
Mom, I'm trying to go over my monologue,

16:07.520 --> 16:08.846
and winkie won't stop farting.

16:08.848 --> 16:11.885
Sorry. I can't help it.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.685
It's your mother.

16:13.687 --> 16:15.551
How's my mother making your son fart?

16:15.553 --> 16:17.318
Oh, so now he's my son, now?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.285
I'm just saying, how does <i> she</i> do that?

16:19.287 --> 16:21.951
She lets Maricel put butter in everything

16:21.953 --> 16:24.018
when I told her that
winkie can't handle dairy.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.251
Let me move into that cabin,

16:25.253 --> 16:27.285
the one Noah used to live in, please?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.918
I'll talk to Maricel about the butter.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.385
It's not about that.

16:30.387 --> 16:32.914
I am a grown-ass woman, and I'm
about to start going to college.

16:32.916 --> 16:36.108
- Excuse me?
- A grown woman talks like one.

16:37.253 --> 16:38.618
I need my own space.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.118
I need my own place.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.685
If anybody is moving into that
cabin, it's gonna be me.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.285
- Dad.
- So take a number.

16:44.287 --> 16:46.685
Hey, after that foolishness
you pulled with Isaiah,

16:46.687 --> 16:48.451
no way we're letting you
out of our sight.

16:48.453 --> 16:52.618
Yes, and we switched you
over to SCC this year

16:52.620 --> 16:55.185
so that we could keep you close.

16:55.187 --> 16:57.551
Nobody can be this close to that.

17:01.753 --> 17:05.018
Can I just ask grandma myself, please?

17:05.020 --> 17:06.550
Yeah, sure. Ask her.

17:06.553 --> 17:08.151
She's gonna say no, too.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.951
Okay. Well, come on, stink butt.

17:16.252 --> 17:17.751
Who called?

17:17.752 --> 17:19.775
Don't worry. It wasn't Tasha.

17:20.353 --> 17:22.218
Who was it, then?

17:22.220 --> 17:24.385
Doris Saunders.

17:24.387 --> 17:27.550
And who is Doris Saunders, Tasha Skanks?

17:27.553 --> 17:28.851
When you gonna let that go?

17:28.853 --> 17:32.551
It's been a week, Jacob. A week.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.485
Doris Saunders is a member
at Triumph, okay?

17:35.487 --> 17:36.751
Well, what she want with you now?

17:36.753 --> 17:39.151
I mean, I don't know. Who knows?

17:39.153 --> 17:40.551
How... how come I've never met her?

17:40.553 --> 17:43.651
Well, how often were you at Triumph?

17:43.653 --> 17:45.918
You were always so busy at excellence.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.858
No.

17:48.220 --> 17:50.485
For all we know, Basie,
Tasha, and Rochelle

17:50.487 --> 17:53.485
are still out there
somewhere trying to set us up.

17:57.087 --> 17:58.817
Don't call back.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.751
Yes, ma'am.

18:05.487 --> 18:09.018
I want her moved in before I get
back from Fairview tomorrow.

18:09.020 --> 18:11.351
Yeah. I'll make sure it happens.

18:11.353 --> 18:13.485
Every day this office sits vacant

18:13.487 --> 18:15.918
is another day her father
and all his acolytes

18:15.920 --> 18:20.351
can keep nursing hopes
this is all some bad dream.

18:20.353 --> 18:22.185
Can you believe she tried
to hire her brother

18:22.187 --> 18:24.051
and sister as APS?

18:24.053 --> 18:25.285
Yeah.

18:25.287 --> 18:26.385
That didn't surprise me.

18:26.387 --> 18:28.385
Her sister's not even a Pastor.

18:28.387 --> 18:31.485
Phil, I can't fault her for that.

18:31.487 --> 18:32.951
Well, you're not thinking
of letting her do it,

18:32.953 --> 18:34.285
- letting her...
- No.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.985
- ...Hire them, are you?
- No, never,

18:35.987 --> 18:37.618
but I don't blame her.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.285
If I was in her position,

18:41.287 --> 18:43.385
I would've tried to do the same thing,

18:43.387 --> 18:45.775
even if it was just to say I tried.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.751
Hey, why are you, uh, going to Fairview?

18:49.753 --> 18:53.518
Mm, just to look in on Cal.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.885
He's barely hanging on.

18:54.887 --> 18:56.951
You know, I haven't seen
a denominational due check

18:56.953 --> 18:58.551
from that church in three years.

18:58.553 --> 19:00.151
Yeah.

19:00.153 --> 19:02.751
While I'm out that way,
I'm also gonna stop by

19:02.753 --> 19:07.458
Bethel, Sinai, Olive Branch...
do the whole circuit.

19:07.460 --> 19:08.951
Hey, you want me to come with you?

19:08.953 --> 19:11.351
We can do the whole
little good cop, bad cop.

19:11.353 --> 19:13.485
No, no, no. You sure you don't want any?

19:13.487 --> 19:15.585
No, no. I'm good, thanks.

19:27.753 --> 19:29.918
So, you got us dookie?

19:29.920 --> 19:31.651
Charity, I tried.

19:31.653 --> 19:33.051
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.

19:33.053 --> 19:36.685
You tried and got us dookie.

19:36.687 --> 19:38.518
Can you please stop using that foul word?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.651
Your nephew is sitting right here.

19:40.653 --> 19:43.018
I'm glad he's here. He needs to hear it.

19:43.020 --> 19:46.451
Don't expect anything from your sister,

19:46.453 --> 19:48.051
and you won't be disappointed.

19:48.053 --> 19:51.551
Did you tell this Phil
that you wouldn't stay on

19:51.553 --> 19:53.985
as interim without your brother
and sister's support?

19:53.987 --> 19:56.451
Kerissa, we have next to no leverage.

19:56.453 --> 19:58.118
Do either of you two understand that?

19:58.120 --> 20:00.818
If I quit, they will put
Phil Demars in the pulpit,

20:00.820 --> 20:03.118
and then we'll have dookie.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.018
I'm not so sure what we have now.

20:05.020 --> 20:07.818
You have someone who's trying
to get this church back.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.051
Trying.

20:09.053 --> 20:10.385
Yeah, trying.

20:10.387 --> 20:11.685
- What?
- Oh, Grace.

20:11.687 --> 20:14.151
I can still remember
the first night you came home.

20:14.153 --> 20:15.818
You were saying all that nonsense

20:15.820 --> 20:19.051
about how God is the part of us
who tries.

20:19.053 --> 20:21.718
Well, right now,
trying doesn't cut it, G.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.918
You better preach.

20:23.920 --> 20:26.718
Charity, there's no need for that.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.718
Ever since you came home,

20:28.720 --> 20:33.251
this family has been on
a swift slide down,

20:33.253 --> 20:36.085
and I have slid the farthest of all.

20:36.087 --> 20:39.351
And what have you suffered
that even vaguely compares

20:39.353 --> 20:41.118
to what Bishop and I have suffered,

20:41.120 --> 20:43.151
<i>are</i> suffering, Kerissa?

20:43.153 --> 20:45.518
Mm-hmm. See, I'm not getting any argument

20:45.520 --> 20:49.651
on the net effect of your homecoming.

20:49.653 --> 20:50.851
Okay, you made your point.

20:50.853 --> 20:51.985
Well, if she hadn't have come back,

20:51.987 --> 20:53.585
these two would be married and retired.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.985
You would be head Pastor of Calvary.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.618
None of this would've even have happened.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.851
I'm not sure that's entirely true.

20:59.853 --> 21:01.151
Oh, I would've made it happen.

21:01.153 --> 21:03.151
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

21:03.153 --> 21:04.751
Fascinating.

21:04.753 --> 21:08.518
Yeah, so instead of sitting here
saying that you tried, Gigi,

21:08.520 --> 21:11.151
like that's some kind of divine
yellow ribbon,

21:11.153 --> 21:13.085
you need to go back to this Phil

21:13.087 --> 21:15.851
and make something happen
for your brother and sister,

21:15.853 --> 21:18.418
for anybody besides your own damn self!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.525
Excuse me, mama.

21:38.453 --> 21:42.785
You can, uh, side-eye me
all you want, Mae,

21:42.787 --> 21:47.985
but I have earned my place in
this conversation 10 times over,

21:47.987 --> 21:51.585
and my opinion is as good as anybody's.

21:51.587 --> 21:52.885
Not when it is delivered

21:52.887 --> 21:56.618
with the stridency of screeching pride.

21:56.620 --> 21:59.218
You want to talk about foul language?

21:59.220 --> 22:01.551
Do you ever think about
what both your children

22:01.553 --> 22:03.567
might learn from your attitude?

22:04.420 --> 22:07.018
You must know you in the wrong, Kerissa.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.817
What I know...

22:09.587 --> 22:11.025
Come on, baby.

22:12.187 --> 22:14.951
...Is that I can't live here.

22:14.953 --> 22:16.400
Mm.

22:18.153 --> 22:19.985
You need to handle your business,

22:19.987 --> 22:22.150
and keep her out of the wine.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.418
It's been hard moving back.

22:24.420 --> 22:27.485
And what is the hard part, the staff?

22:27.487 --> 22:29.251
The 50 acres, or the rent?

22:29.253 --> 22:32.525
Which, as far as I know, is free?

22:34.053 --> 22:35.351
So, wait.

22:35.353 --> 22:39.285
Is Gigi going to talk to Phil,
or... or who is it?

22:39.287 --> 22:41.185
What... what is happening?

22:41.187 --> 22:43.218
I'll see she talks to Bob.

22:43.220 --> 22:44.733
Good.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.358
'Cause I'm not going back to singing.

22:48.420 --> 22:51.785
You know Satan can take a gift
that God has given you

22:51.787 --> 22:54.442
and use it to hold you in bondage.

22:56.087 --> 22:58.851
You know, that's what I'm-a
preach about when I'm AP...

22:58.853 --> 23:00.651
Satan's ways.

23:00.653 --> 23:02.485
I'm-a do a whole series.

23:02.487 --> 23:03.885
Okay, you know what?

23:03.887 --> 23:05.385
What makes you think you gonna be AP?

23:05.387 --> 23:07.851
'Cause I am. I'm gonna be AP before you.

23:07.853 --> 23:09.718
- Oh, please.
- Why you always try to do a...

23:09.720 --> 23:11.018
- Jacob!
- ...Series on something?

23:11.020 --> 23:12.751
- Whatever.
- Whatever what?

23:12.753 --> 23:16.518
The sins and stupidity
this poor table has seen.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.585
I'm surprised it doesn't
just crash to the floor.

23:24.587 --> 23:27.351
Mm-mm-mm.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.618
- You didn't do anything wrong.
- Tell Charity.

23:43.620 --> 23:47.551
And I know I feel sick knowing
why Bob probably will, too.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.018
Charity shouldn't preach, anyway.

23:49.020 --> 23:51.218
She probably shouldn't even drive,

23:51.220 --> 23:52.851
and does Jacob even want to be AP?

23:52.853 --> 23:54.785
Uh, if Kerissa wants it, that's enough.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.518
Kerissa's worse than Charity.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.817
You're right.

23:59.187 --> 24:02.233
But this is not about them.

24:03.053 --> 24:06.851
This is about what you can do
to keep this family together.

24:06.853 --> 24:09.285
Can we please just tell them
that I'm Lionel's daughter?

24:09.287 --> 24:11.946
I am so tired of having this

24:11.948 --> 24:13.885
secret hanging over my head.

24:13.887 --> 24:16.718
It's my head that it's hanging over.

24:19.167 --> 24:22.298
I'm not talking
about my reputation, mama.

24:22.520 --> 24:26.018
I am talking about who I am,
my identity, my life.

24:30.253 --> 24:31.792
We will tell them

24:33.240 --> 24:36.451
once we have won this church back,

24:36.453 --> 24:41.851
and we're all sitting together
in... in... in victory, unity.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.451
I'll ask Bob about it tomorrow.

24:51.887 --> 24:53.483
Don't ask.

24:54.553 --> 24:55.618
Tell.

25:16.953 --> 25:19.418
That was Doris Saunders
I spoke to earlier.

25:19.420 --> 25:21.551
Why do I even bother talking?

25:21.553 --> 25:24.185
Her son plays for the Red Devils,

25:24.187 --> 25:26.317
has been having some issues lately,

25:26.920 --> 25:29.018
so she's asked me to be his life coach.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.951
- How much does it pay?
- I don't know.

25:30.953 --> 25:32.685
But she wants me to go with her tomorrow

25:32.687 --> 25:34.208
to meet with the GM.

25:35.787 --> 25:37.418
Good.

26:04.487 --> 26:06.692
Yes? May I help you?

26:07.487 --> 26:10.118
I was just in my quarters, and...

26:10.120 --> 26:11.518
Yes?

26:14.820 --> 26:16.451
When do you see me moving back up in here

26:16.453 --> 26:19.733
and us sharing a bed again?

26:20.620 --> 26:23.596
When we're remarried, of course.

26:23.598 --> 26:26.518
when do you think that should be?

26:26.520 --> 26:28.585
Look, I... I don't know.
When we're in love.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.885
Isn't that when people
do that kind of thing?

26:34.987 --> 26:36.618
You're not in love with me?

26:40.053 --> 26:41.118
I love you, James.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.918
I... I've never stopped loving you,

26:42.920 --> 26:46.567
but as far as being in love, I...

26:47.120 --> 26:50.551
What do you want, flowers and a ring?

26:50.553 --> 26:52.285
Yes.

26:52.287 --> 26:54.185
Yes, and more than that, too.

26:56.187 --> 26:59.618
I'm not some country girl who's
never been to the pictures.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.218
You are courting a woman now, James,

27:04.220 --> 27:07.185
who has had literally everything.

27:14.320 --> 27:17.067
So you'll just have to
sweep me off my feet.

27:17.920 --> 27:19.551
How?

27:24.153 --> 27:25.618
In ways.

27:29.020 --> 27:31.318
Ways I can't even imagine.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.385
Good to know.

27:41.387 --> 27:42.985
Hmm.

27:46.787 --> 27:48.385
Good night.

28:17.820 --> 28:20.485
<i>Hello. You have a message from...</i>

28:20.487 --> 28:22.118
<i> Aj Delahay.</i>

28:22.120 --> 28:25.218
<i>...An inmate at the Yuma
federal correctional center.</i>

28:25.220 --> 28:27.718
<i>To retrieve your message,
please press one.</i>

28:27.720 --> 28:30.418
<i>If you feel you have received
this message in error,</i>

28:30.420 --> 28:31.751
<i>please remain on the line,</i>

28:31.753 --> 28:33.485
<i>and a correctional office
representative...</i>

28:45.920 --> 28:47.118
Good morning.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.418
Oh, look at my Bible buddy.

28:53.420 --> 28:57.685
Can I move into Noah's old cabin?

28:57.687 --> 29:00.918
Did your parents give you
permission to ask me that?

29:00.920 --> 29:02.651
Yes.

29:02.653 --> 29:04.285
Hmm.

29:07.020 --> 29:09.218
I tell you what.

29:09.220 --> 29:12.251
If you resume our Bible studies.

29:12.253 --> 29:13.485
That's at 5:00 in the morning.

29:13.487 --> 29:15.218
Zora.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.851
Someday, this church will be ours again,

29:17.853 --> 29:22.451
which means it will be mine
and then maybe auntie Grace's,

29:22.453 --> 29:26.085
and then maybe someday, it will be yours.

29:26.087 --> 29:27.651
God will never call me to preach.

29:27.653 --> 29:30.585
Oh, well, maybe he's
calling you right now.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.785
Okay. Well, how about 5:30?

29:36.787 --> 29:39.285
oh, girl.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.351
The key's in my desk.

29:43.353 --> 29:44.385
Thank you.

29:44.387 --> 29:46.385
Oh, don't thank me.

29:46.387 --> 29:48.485
Thank God, because this is the beginning

29:48.487 --> 29:50.650
of a great adventure.

29:51.587 --> 29:52.918
Thank you so much.

29:57.287 --> 29:59.285
Hey, Grace. You got a second?

29:59.287 --> 30:01.385
So, are you moving
into your new office today?

30:01.387 --> 30:03.751
I'll move in when I'm ready.

30:03.753 --> 30:05.018
Bob just wanted to make sure

30:05.020 --> 30:06.551
you did it before he got back today.

30:40.053 --> 30:43.851
<i>Grace, it's Noah. Call me back.</i>

30:43.853 --> 30:45.817
<i>We really need to talk.</i>

30:46.387 --> 30:48.018
<i>It's important.</i>

30:52.053 --> 30:55.485
And so I feel with all of that behind me,

30:55.487 --> 30:58.951
losing Kevin to the gays
and my baby to Jesus

30:58.953 --> 31:01.618
and shaking off
those bonds of fear with Iayama,

31:01.620 --> 31:04.751
I am ready to preach.

31:04.753 --> 31:08.018
Grace did bring the idea
to us of you being AP,

31:08.020 --> 31:09.218
and passionately.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.375
Oh, whatever.

31:10.377 --> 31:13.651
I'm sure she did not express
everything that I just told you.

31:13.653 --> 31:15.151
Well, that's definitely true.

31:15.153 --> 31:18.525
See, I knew it. Because she hates me.

31:19.053 --> 31:20.118
And I would hate her, too.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.418
If Jesus didn't tell me
I couldn't, I would.

31:22.420 --> 31:24.618
Well, that's a separate issue.

31:24.620 --> 31:25.851
Look, I know.

31:25.853 --> 31:29.318
You don't want too many Greenleafs,

31:29.320 --> 31:30.551
but I'm the good one.

31:32.420 --> 31:34.685
Well, I'm better than Grace, at least.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.085
I tell you what.

31:39.087 --> 31:42.118
Phil, please don't ask me
to be the music minister.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.351
No, no. I hear you.

31:44.353 --> 31:46.385
With that being said,

31:46.387 --> 31:48.985
if you were to be my, say,

31:48.987 --> 31:51.685
eyes and ears among the Greenleafs,

31:51.687 --> 31:53.051
in the service of me making sure

31:53.053 --> 31:54.851
that once this year of transition is over

31:54.853 --> 31:59.692
that I'd be made
head Pastor and not Grace,

32:00.320 --> 32:05.618
I'd definitely make you AP
in exchange for that kindness.

32:08.387 --> 32:10.782
Are... are you asking me to spy?

32:10.784 --> 32:13.551
Oh, no. I didn't say that word,
and I never would.

32:13.553 --> 32:16.285
I'm just saying you scratch my back,

32:16.287 --> 32:18.900
and I'll scratch yours...

32:19.753 --> 32:21.270
Pastor.

32:37.587 --> 32:38.918
Reverend Greenleaf.

32:41.387 --> 32:43.351
Mr. Whitmore.

32:43.353 --> 32:44.951
Ah, you're all moved in.

32:44.953 --> 32:47.275
I was told it was a priority.

32:47.920 --> 32:50.185
Uh, Phil said you wanted to talk.

32:50.187 --> 32:53.067
Yeah, I do. Can you have a seat?

32:53.753 --> 32:55.351
What's on your mind?

33:00.553 --> 33:03.018
Pastor Greenleaf, Ms.
Saunders here speaks very highly of you,

33:03.020 --> 33:05.451
and now that I've had the chance
to sit with you,

33:05.453 --> 33:07.218
I do understand why.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.751
That's great, thanks.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.318
Hey, I'll take it.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.485
You should hear him preach.

33:12.487 --> 33:15.285
Yeah, well, that's kind of
what I was about to bring up.

33:15.287 --> 33:17.085
It's no secret that Dante's a handful.

33:17.087 --> 33:18.851
Even in a game with more
than its share of handfuls,

33:18.853 --> 33:20.985
he stands out as being a real handful.

33:20.987 --> 33:23.318
That's why we really want
someone in this position

33:23.320 --> 33:27.067
he'll respect, someone impeccable.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.385
But you've sown
your own share of wild oats,

33:29.387 --> 33:31.318
if I can trust the papers.

33:31.320 --> 33:32.651
Oh, well, uh, you know,

33:32.653 --> 33:34.618
I've been cleared of all
wrongdoing at Triumph.

33:34.620 --> 33:36.518
Yes, I know, but you're not
even employed by a church

33:36.520 --> 33:38.185
at this point.

33:38.187 --> 33:39.751
Is that correct?

33:39.753 --> 33:41.551
That is correct.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.418
But, uh, I'm hoping to be reinstated

33:44.420 --> 33:46.418
as associate Pastor back at Calvary.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.651
I should hear something
by the end of the day.

33:48.653 --> 33:50.817
You know, we've definitely
been praying on it.

33:51.787 --> 33:54.951
Perry, he's the one. God told me.

33:54.953 --> 33:56.851
This man is the one
that's gonna get my Dante

33:56.853 --> 33:58.358
through this.

33:59.087 --> 34:02.018
Okay, well, uh, it's not like
the owners are,

34:02.020 --> 34:04.418
you know, connoisseurs of decency,

34:04.420 --> 34:06.318
but it sure would help

34:06.320 --> 34:08.018
if your name was on
some church's letterhead,

34:08.020 --> 34:09.585
you know what I'm saying?

34:09.587 --> 34:11.150
I'm clear.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.251
Let me get this straight.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.918
You're ready to walk away from this job

34:18.920 --> 34:21.150
if I don't agree to hire
your brother and sister?

34:21.152 --> 34:22.351
Just walk away?

34:22.353 --> 34:24.983
Yeah, and it's non-negotiable.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.817
And so what would you do?

34:29.353 --> 34:30.618
What would I do if what?

34:30.620 --> 34:33.067
If I say, "no, take a hike"?

34:33.487 --> 34:35.483
You won't say no.

34:35.853 --> 34:37.217
Ever since you showed up here,

34:37.219 --> 34:39.608
you've been telling me
how much <i> you</i> need <i> me.</i>

34:40.387 --> 34:41.585
Are you not worried at all

34:41.587 --> 34:44.858
about overexaggerating your importance?

34:45.187 --> 34:48.067
Are you gonna hire
my brother and sister or not?

34:49.053 --> 34:54.150
Grace, I've been following you
for a long time.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.751
Even back in Phoenix.

35:00.753 --> 35:02.151
Following me how?

35:02.153 --> 35:05.651
On TV. "Grace Greenleaf reports."

35:08.187 --> 35:10.233
I could tell even then,

35:11.087 --> 35:13.285
you have more of
the righteous truth in you

35:13.287 --> 35:16.400
than any TV reporter could hold.

35:16.720 --> 35:20.108
If you can just put
your family drama aside,

35:20.720 --> 35:24.018
this could be the beginning
of a whole new chapter for you

35:24.020 --> 35:27.151
as the religious leader
God has always meant you to be.

35:29.187 --> 35:31.318
I need for you to hire
my brother and sister

35:31.320 --> 35:34.518
as my associate pastors, or I'm out.

35:37.320 --> 35:40.192
Putting family first is a mistake.

35:41.387 --> 35:43.018
It's what I have to do.

35:45.120 --> 35:47.051
Grace.

36:01.053 --> 36:02.585
Excuse me, ma'am.

36:02.587 --> 36:05.051
Is it okay if I take this up
to your suite and put it away?

36:05.053 --> 36:06.485
Yeah. That'd be fine, Maricel.

36:06.487 --> 36:08.085
Thank you.

36:08.087 --> 36:11.692
Oh, Lady Mae told me to tell you.

36:12.220 --> 36:13.567
Yes?

36:14.020 --> 36:15.718
She's fine with me doing your laundry,

36:15.720 --> 36:19.118
but she'd like it if you did it
on Tuesdays and Fridays

36:19.120 --> 36:20.685
with the rest of the house.

36:20.687 --> 36:24.318
I can just do it myself.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.551
She doesn't want anyone but
the staff using the machines.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.551
They're very finicky.

36:29.553 --> 36:30.751
If you could just do it on...

36:30.753 --> 36:33.525
Tuesdays and Fridays, got it.

36:34.287 --> 36:36.718
thank you, ma'am.

36:42.187 --> 36:43.551
Hey, good news.

36:43.553 --> 36:46.585
Oh, please tell me you got that job.

36:46.587 --> 36:48.451
I have got to get out of this house.

36:48.453 --> 36:53.118
Well, hey, if Gigi gets me AP, we're set.

36:54.453 --> 36:55.818
What?

36:55.820 --> 36:58.051
You just told me getting out
from under your mother

36:58.053 --> 37:00.018
depends on Gigi.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.651
That's not good news.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.051
So, who is this guy?

37:17.053 --> 37:18.385
Dante Saunders.

37:18.387 --> 37:20.918
The kid who ran over the
confederate statue with his car?

37:20.920 --> 37:22.651
Mm-hmm.

37:22.653 --> 37:24.918
My dad's gonna be his spiritual advisor,

37:24.920 --> 37:27.185
life coach, whatever.

37:27.187 --> 37:28.718
I'm-a be his love coach.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.085
Did it ever occur to you to pick out

37:30.087 --> 37:32.818
someone who isn't total trouble?

37:32.820 --> 37:34.885
What do you mean? He's a hero.

37:34.887 --> 37:36.718
I heard his blood-alcohol
content when he did it

37:36.720 --> 37:38.118
was off the charts.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.018
Who told you that?

37:41.358 --> 37:42.651
Roberto.

37:42.653 --> 37:45.317
He came by last night to say goodbye.

37:45.953 --> 37:48.518
Why do you have to leave? Just stay.

37:48.520 --> 37:49.685
Be boring with Roberto.

37:49.687 --> 37:51.418
You can live with me.

37:54.853 --> 37:57.051
Look, I wish I could stay, but I can't.

37:57.053 --> 38:00.118
mm-Kay.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.900
I'm gonna miss you.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.218
You are.

38:05.220 --> 38:06.485
You are gonna miss me.

38:06.487 --> 38:08.085
Come here.

38:10.787 --> 38:12.585
I told him if I didn't get what I wanted,

38:12.587 --> 38:14.317
I'm out, full stop.

38:15.020 --> 38:16.483
And?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.485
He said Jacob could be AP.

38:19.487 --> 38:22.018
Yes! See?

38:22.020 --> 38:23.650
See what?

38:23.987 --> 38:26.942
Oh, nothing, just thank you.

38:27.687 --> 38:29.192
What about me?

38:30.287 --> 38:32.483
He wouldn't do it. I'm sorry.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.085
So how come you still have a job?

38:38.387 --> 38:41.418
- Because...
- that was the deal, right?

38:41.420 --> 38:46.018
"Give me Jacob <i> and</i> Charity,
or I'll walk."

38:46.020 --> 38:47.418
well, it seemed like once he said...

38:47.420 --> 38:49.618
how come you not walking, Grace?!

38:49.620 --> 38:51.618
Charity, once he said
yes to the idea of Jacob,

38:51.620 --> 38:53.351
it didn't seem right to just continue...

38:53.353 --> 38:56.025
oh, so you didn't push for me at all?

38:56.553 --> 38:58.285
I pushed as much as I could,

38:58.287 --> 38:59.918
and then when it stopped making sense...

38:59.920 --> 39:01.651
an idea you might not understand...

39:01.653 --> 39:03.451
so why Jacob and not me?

39:03.453 --> 39:05.185
Jacob's led a church, Charity.

39:05.187 --> 39:07.185
Oh, so you on Gigi's side

39:07.187 --> 39:08.551
now that you getting everything you want?

39:08.553 --> 39:10.051
- Oh, my.
- Well, here goes crazy.

39:10.053 --> 39:11.985
You know what? I will whoop
your ass, string bean.

39:11.987 --> 39:13.351
Bring it, butter bean!

39:13.353 --> 39:14.485
- Really?
- Y'all, stop.

39:14.487 --> 39:16.151
Both of y'all, stop.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.651
None of you care about me.

39:21.653 --> 39:25.218
Would you please stop catastrophizing?

39:25.220 --> 39:31.518
Not one of you has walked over
to hug me or to say,

39:31.520 --> 39:35.851
"sorry, Charity. I know this hurts."

39:35.853 --> 39:38.285
if you would just be quiet
and have your feelings

39:38.287 --> 39:41.851
instead of spraying like some
loose fire hose, maybe we could.

39:41.853 --> 39:43.150
Yeah.

39:43.853 --> 39:45.118
Just watch.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.985
Oh, Charity, ple... just sit down, okay?

39:46.987 --> 39:49.951
Why? Why? Because y'all the ones

39:49.953 --> 39:54.585
that's gonna get this church
back, 'cause y'all the A-team?

39:54.587 --> 39:55.951
Well, when it's all said and done,

39:55.953 --> 39:58.118
you want to know who's gonna be preaching

39:58.120 --> 40:02.585
and teaching and reaching
for every possible star

40:02.587 --> 40:04.051
from behind that pulpit?

40:04.053 --> 40:05.608
Me!

40:06.920 --> 40:09.118
Mm-mm.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.718
Go ahead and laugh, Kerissa.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.118
Huh, what?

40:12.120 --> 40:15.192
I'm the one that's bringing
dignity back to Calvary.

40:15.987 --> 40:17.618
Ain't that right, Daddy?

40:17.620 --> 40:18.751
Yes, baby, but don't run...

40:18.753 --> 40:22.451
Pastor Charity Greenleaf.

40:24.687 --> 40:26.275
'Cause God is good...

40:26.887 --> 40:28.442
All the time.

40:30.787 --> 40:32.608
Hallelujah.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.318
He's looking for mama.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.918
Mama's busy.

41:02.187 --> 41:04.351
This is Phil.

41:04.353 --> 41:05.951
I'm in.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.618
Noah, hey.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.900
Grace, why haven't you called me back?

41:35.353 --> 41:39.285
I've been busy. What's up?

41:39.287 --> 41:41.085
I just got a phone call from some inmate

41:41.087 --> 41:43.025
at a prison in Arizona.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.051
<i>He says he's our son.</i>
