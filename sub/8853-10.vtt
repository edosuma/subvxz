WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.940
All right,
I got a serious question.

00:03.530 --> 00:06.800
For $100,000 would
you suck a man's penis?

00:06.870 --> 00:09.140
A man's penis?
I don't know.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.700
Yeah, you get to pick the dude.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.370
- So final dick approval?
- All yours.

00:12.440 --> 00:14.040
Choose any dick I want to?

00:14.110 --> 00:15.580
Whoever's dick,
except for me and Blake's.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.840
- All right.
- Well...

00:16.910 --> 00:18.410
Then yeah, totally.
Definitely.

00:18.480 --> 00:19.850
- Okay.
- Uh-huh, 100 gs?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.580
Yeah, I think so.
Whoo!

00:21.650 --> 00:24.390
Okay, what about $75,000?

00:24.450 --> 00:26.490
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, for sure.

00:26.550 --> 00:28.520
Let's get real.
Five grand?

00:28.590 --> 00:31.060
- Yes.
- Really?

00:31.130 --> 00:32.930
I'd be 30 seconds away
from getting

00:32.990 --> 00:35.130
a pretty sweet used motorcycle.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.700
No, it would take you
way longer than that, dude.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.470
- No, I think--
- Who do you think you are?

00:39.530 --> 00:40.830
Are you kidding me right now?

00:40.900 --> 00:42.540
Have you seen these lips?
I have.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.870
Have you enjoyed the presence
of me eating a kielbasa?

00:45.940 --> 00:47.810
It's ridonk.
Wow.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.710
It's weird. Girls are like,
"I'm impressed by that."

00:49.780 --> 00:51.410
Okay, hold on.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.110
What is the absolute
least amount of money

00:53.180 --> 00:55.080
you could get paid
to blow a guy?

00:55.150 --> 00:57.150
- Now we're talking.
- If I'm honest with myself?

00:57.220 --> 00:59.690
- Yeah.
- I'd have to say...

00:59.750 --> 01:00.920
$900.

01:00.990 --> 01:02.720
Oh, my God!

01:02.790 --> 01:04.890
- Whoa.
- Oh, my God.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.090
- Wait, wait.
- Was that a--

01:06.160 --> 01:08.060
- are you okay?
Are you all right?

01:08.130 --> 01:10.630
Uh...Yeah, yeah.
I think so.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.370
Could you give me a...?
Got you, buddy.

01:12.430 --> 01:13.970
No sweat.
Don't sweat it.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.640
Did you say 900 bucks?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.240
No, I said $9,000.
I said $9,000.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.570
I heard $900.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.370
No, I said "thousand," dude.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.440
I've got standards, I'm
not just blowing everybody.

01:22.510 --> 01:23.740
Grow up.

How much to punch
your mother in the face?

01:39.690 --> 01:42.400
And you really gotta
try and knock her out.

01:42.460 --> 01:45.070
30 grand, I'm laying
that chick out cold.

01:45.130 --> 01:46.900
Lovely woman, but...Pow!

01:46.970 --> 01:48.470
Dude, where is everybody?

01:48.540 --> 01:49.670
It's like
a Saturday or something.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.570
Yeah, really.
Is it a ditch day?

01:51.640 --> 01:53.710
Do we have those here?
Oh, we should start a ditch day.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.010
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, we should.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.010
- Fumble!
- Oh!

01:57.080 --> 01:59.950
Are you
Kidding me right now?

02:00.020 --> 02:02.650
What are you doing?
We're in the conference room.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.490
He's here.
Who's here?

02:04.550 --> 02:07.350
Bruce Benson, Adam.
The CEO of the company.

02:07.420 --> 02:08.820
Never heard of him.

02:08.889 --> 02:10.460
Didn't you
check your work email?

02:10.530 --> 02:12.490
Work em--is that
something that's real?

02:12.560 --> 02:14.360
Work email?
I wouldn't worry about this.

02:14.430 --> 02:17.700
I'm pretty sure we can
charm the CEO's pants off.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.430
Good morning, everyone.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.400
I'm Bruce Benson.
Yes, that Bruce Benson.

02:22.470 --> 02:24.570
The CEO of Telamericorp.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.380
So our annual investors
meeting is tomorrow morning--

02:28.440 --> 02:31.080
- let's go.
- And I have a big announcement

02:31.150 --> 02:32.880
that will affect all
of your futures.

02:32.950 --> 02:38.450
So I think you deserve
to hear first that...

02:38.520 --> 02:39.790
Lunch is on me!

02:41.020 --> 02:42.790
Hardee's for everyone!

02:42.860 --> 02:44.590
Hardee's or Arby's?

02:44.660 --> 02:46.530
I hope it's not Hardee's.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.330
Heard their fries
are just rat tails.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.630
Hey. Bruce Benson.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.200
That's a beautiful watch.

02:51.270 --> 02:53.500
Oh, you know what?
It's yours.

02:53.570 --> 02:56.540
- Oh, thank you, sir!
- Wait, you can't have it.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.170
Not without the shirt too.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.470
What a cool ass boss.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.010
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.480
- Where are you going?
- Our phone is runni--

03:04.550 --> 03:06.050
our car is ring--
egh.

03:06.110 --> 03:08.450
I gotta go.
Work out or something.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.320
Well, whatever.
He wants to meet everybody.

03:10.390 --> 03:12.320
So just smile
and try to act normal.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.920
- Hey.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.420
- Oh, my God.
- Mm.

03:15.490 --> 03:16.960
Mr. Benson,
good to re-meet you.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.830
'Cause we met each other
earlier, do you remember?

03:18.890 --> 03:20.490
- I do remember.
- Oh, good.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.760
So then you don't have
any brain damage--whew!

03:22.830 --> 03:24.630
We were worried.
We were worried about that.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.430
Yeah, what are
we talking about?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.870
We accidentally hit this guy
with our car this morning,

03:28.940 --> 03:30.500
so we're just...
It's hilarious.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.010
So we're laughing.
Our bad.

03:32.070 --> 03:33.810
It's not funny.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.910
These three psychopaths
almost killed me.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.480
Lunch, Maxwell's.

03:39.550 --> 03:42.750
We're gonna discuss
your future at this company.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.690
Cool ass boss.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.530
Mr. Benson, hello.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.060
Hey, how's your food?

03:54.130 --> 03:55.900
- Mm, looking good.
- Finish chewing.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.630
Nice blazer.
Whoa.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.870
Let's just cut to the chase.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.370
Wait, before you say anything,

04:00.440 --> 04:02.370
just wanna let you know
we know we got off

04:02.440 --> 04:03.570
to a rocky start this morning.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.470
- Mm-hm.
- But it is so natural

04:05.540 --> 04:07.370
for people
to hit people in cars.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.040
Yes, it's truly--it's just
something that happens

04:09.110 --> 04:10.910
if you--if you live
in the world.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.850
So you do.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.780
Just sit and listen.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.620
Saying you're
making a mistake here.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.750
Wow, this is so harsh.

04:22.520 --> 04:23.960
I cannot go back
to working at hot topic,

04:24.030 --> 04:25.760
because they said
I have to cut my hair,

04:25.830 --> 04:27.590
and I could've swore
that thing was punk rock.

04:27.660 --> 04:28.700
Hey!
Shh.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.430
I'm not gonna fire you.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.800
- Okay.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.770
Great.
Oh, my gosh!

04:34.840 --> 04:37.000
I thought for sure
he was gonna fire us.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.670
Wow.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.940
I wanna pay you
$10,000 to kill me.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.450
- What?
- Huh?

04:45.510 --> 04:47.480
That's real?

04:47.550 --> 04:49.850
So I'm just
gonna leave this here.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.490
You guys talk it over.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.390
I'll be out back, waiting.

04:53.450 --> 04:56.460
To die, hopefully.

04:56.520 --> 04:57.930
Okay, this guy's insane, right?

04:57.990 --> 05:00.290
I mean, I don't know.
Like suicide, right?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.860
Like, if your mother
was on her death bed,

05:01.930 --> 05:03.400
and she asked you to kill her,

05:03.460 --> 05:05.630
you wouldn't just
take the pillow, and...

05:05.700 --> 05:07.030
Smother her to heaven?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.700
Adam, this guy's
not dying, okay?

05:08.770 --> 05:10.070
He had a bad day at the office.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.640
There's a difference.
Who knows?

05:11.710 --> 05:13.440
No, wait.
I am not done with that.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.410
There are some calimari--
Sorry, it's really good.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.280
He loves this stuff.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.310
I don't think
that I need to say this,

05:19.380 --> 05:20.910
but you guys are you guys,

05:20.980 --> 05:23.520
so we're not going
to kill this person, right?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.750
- Um.
- Are you serious, Adam?

05:25.820 --> 05:27.490
No.
I'm not really serio--

05:27.560 --> 05:29.360
I don't wanna
kill the dude but, like...

05:29.420 --> 05:31.590
We should talk about it
a little bit, right?

05:31.660 --> 05:33.290
10,000 bucks?

05:33.360 --> 05:34.930
That's enough to get us
our own hot air balloon,

05:35.000 --> 05:37.400
or jet skis, or, like,
just a cool riding lawnmower.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.370
For the--you know, whatever.
What are you--

05:40.440 --> 05:41.500
you're doing that right now?

05:41.570 --> 05:42.940
Yes, it's a bathroom.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.610
You're the weird one
for not pissing.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.010
Actually, that's
not a bad idea, Adam,

05:46.070 --> 05:47.540
I do have to tink.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.980
Oh, look, they
got a sports section.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.450
Oh, I want sports.
I got travel.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.510
Pinch and switch.
Okay.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.580
You guys,
there's someone out there

05:57.650 --> 05:59.520
that asked us to murder them.

05:59.590 --> 06:00.990
Are you ready
to kill someone dead?

06:01.060 --> 06:03.360
Yeah, American soldiers kill
people, like, every day.

06:03.420 --> 06:05.260
Are you better than
American soldiers, man?

06:05.330 --> 06:06.790
Like, think about other people.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.660
Oh, that's airtight logic.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.930
Okay, what is this fight in
the middle east all about, dude?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.030
Cash money, right?
And what's this about?

06:14.100 --> 06:16.370
This is about
cash money as well.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.910
- Stop pointing it at me!
- 10,000 little cash money.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.840
Adam, I'm with Ders, man.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.280
I mean, really,
if you wanted, like, 10 gs,

06:23.340 --> 06:25.460
couldn't you just
blow 11 dudes at 9 hundo a pop?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.570
Okay, I said 9,000--

06:27.620 --> 06:30.690
Oh, man!
It's a gun!

06:31.290 --> 06:33.650
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.230
Hey, what's the beef, chief?

06:49.290 --> 06:51.890
All right, boys.
Are you ready to do this?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.860
I know just the place
to drop my body--

06:53.930 --> 06:55.870
or my head at least.
- Stop it.

06:55.930 --> 06:57.300
Why do you want us to kill you?

06:57.370 --> 06:59.270
Because you're
clearly psychopaths.

06:59.340 --> 07:02.670
Wow, I'm kind of the furthest
thing from a psychopath.

07:02.740 --> 07:04.670
So you'd suck
a [Bleep] For $900,

07:04.740 --> 07:06.240
but you won't kill
a stranger for ten grand?

07:06.310 --> 07:07.840
Okay, I said 9,000!
Okay, you wanna

07:07.910 --> 07:09.180
go right now, dude?
Stop it.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.080
Okay, clearly
he is a psychopath.

07:11.150 --> 07:12.620
- I said 9,000.
- Relax.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.520
My question is
why do you wanna die?

07:14.580 --> 07:17.150
Don't you get it?
I'm spineless.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.760
I've mismanaged this
company into the ground,

07:19.820 --> 07:21.620
and I have to tell
the investors tomorrow,

07:21.690 --> 07:23.160
and I can't do it.
H-hell, I tried to jump

07:23.230 --> 07:24.660
in front of
your car this morning,

07:24.730 --> 07:26.000
but at the last minute
I bailed.

07:26.060 --> 07:27.300
I couldn't even do that.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.130
Car dodging?
That's cool.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.970
I did that once after
seeing the movie <i>the program.</i>

07:31.030 --> 07:32.740
So good.
Have you seen it?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.100
Yeah, I actually
co-financed it.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.040
- So good.
- Look at me.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.810
I should've just been
a public school teacher

07:37.870 --> 07:39.540
like my idiot mom.
Shouldn't say that.

07:39.610 --> 07:41.040
I'm about to cry.

07:41.110 --> 07:44.610
I'm really gonna cry here.
You know what?

07:44.680 --> 07:46.220
Get in the car.
What are you doing?

07:46.280 --> 07:47.950
- So you'll do it?
- Huh?

07:48.020 --> 07:49.550
- You'll kill me?
- N--

07:49.620 --> 07:50.990
oh, no!
No.

07:51.050 --> 07:52.220
Okay.

07:52.290 --> 07:54.720
This...Uh-huh?
No! Don't!

07:54.790 --> 07:56.060
- And you know what?
- What?

07:56.130 --> 07:57.690
Now there's
only four bullets left.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.990
And if you
don't get in that car,

07:59.060 --> 08:00.600
I'm throwing two more.
Yep, yep.

08:00.660 --> 08:02.100
Okay, take it easy, buddy.
Take it easy.

08:02.170 --> 08:05.700
I'm gonna get in the car.

08:05.770 --> 08:07.800
- I call shotgun!
- Now we're holding the cards.

08:07.870 --> 08:12.070
Okay, work sucks.
Nobody likes their job.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.680
- Except Jamie Foxx.
- Right, that's true.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.010
But we work for the weekends.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.680
And we know today's Thursday,

08:17.750 --> 08:20.350
but we're gonna party
like it's Friday, dude.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.890
- It's Wednesday.
- Is it?

08:22.950 --> 08:25.120
All right, well, it is settled.

08:25.190 --> 08:27.160
We are gonna throw you
a party that is just

08:27.220 --> 08:29.260
gonna make you wanna
live the rest of your life.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.060
Now get out.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.590
Or what?

08:32.659 --> 08:36.799
Okay, okay, okay!
I'm going.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.940
Yo, boss, can I borrow the
whip and go to the liquor store?

08:42.010 --> 08:43.669
Keep it.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.110
Hopefully I'll be dead
by the time you get back.

08:45.180 --> 08:46.810
Thank you,
but don't joke about that.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.180
I'll get some booze,
some doritos collisions.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.080
Get this party torqued.

08:52.150 --> 08:54.020
I'm gonna get the collisions,
maybe some booze,

08:54.080 --> 08:55.780
but I'm really
gonna go for a joyride.

08:55.850 --> 08:57.850
Wow, Ders.
You're a wild man.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.760
I know.

08:59.820 --> 09:02.790
Whoo-hoo-hooo!

09:02.860 --> 09:06.830
Tonight's party
is gonna be weird.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.760
In a good way.
Yes.

09:08.830 --> 09:10.730
It is gonna be so awesome.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.630
Anything you want, man,
you name it.

09:12.700 --> 09:14.070
It's your credit card.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.800
You know what'd really be cool?

09:15.870 --> 09:17.310
Putting a bullet through
my face.

09:17.370 --> 09:19.010
- Okay.
- You know what?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.580
I would love to
just end your suffering,

09:21.640 --> 09:24.080
I really would.
I would, I'm your guy.

09:24.150 --> 09:26.020
If you would've caught me
without these two,

09:26.080 --> 09:28.120
you would've been dead
in an alley somewhere.

09:28.180 --> 09:30.220
But what would you
wanna do for fun

09:30.290 --> 09:32.120
since I can't murder you?

09:32.190 --> 09:33.890
Do you cut loose?
Do you drink, do you smoke?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.160
Do you like getting wild?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.860
Say bye to the bullets.
Okay, okay!

09:39.930 --> 09:41.330
I like girls.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.700
What type of girls do you like?

09:42.770 --> 09:44.870
I don't know.

09:44.930 --> 09:46.070
I've never really had
a girlfriend.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.670
What?

09:47.740 --> 09:50.010
Whoa, dude.
You're like that movie.

09:50.070 --> 09:52.840
That's weird!
You have an escalade,

09:52.910 --> 09:54.340
and you don't
have a girlfriend, man?

09:54.410 --> 09:56.650
You could just cruise past
ice cream parlors

09:56.710 --> 09:58.350
and pick up chicks
in that thing.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.650
Hey, I know what it's like
not to have a girlfriend.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.590
It's not a big deal,
'cause you know what?

10:03.650 --> 10:06.620
We have our imaginations.
Right?

10:06.690 --> 10:08.220
This is the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

10:08.290 --> 10:11.130
- Who's your dream girl?
- Michelle Obama.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.690
We can work with that.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.960
Somebody get me a phone book.

10:15.030 --> 10:16.670
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

10:16.730 --> 10:18.200
Whoop, there it is.

10:18.270 --> 10:20.440
And I'm just
gonna put this on there,

10:20.500 --> 10:22.500

10:27.740 --> 10:29.380
Open up, man.

10:29.450 --> 10:30.980
Come on, man.
Let me in.

10:31.050 --> 10:34.280
Sorry it took so long.
I was street racing Asian kids.

10:34.350 --> 10:36.250

10:36.320 --> 10:38.320
- What?
- You have to have a password.

10:38.390 --> 10:39.960
- Sorry, you know the rules.
- I got the doritos.

10:40.020 --> 10:41.860
And I got some
Kahlua mudslide mix,

10:41.930 --> 10:43.490
but they didn't double bag it,
so it's about to rip.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.090
You have to know the password.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.700
- Yeah.
- It is ripping now,

10:46.760 --> 10:47.900
just let me in!

Hey, everybody,

11:31.410 --> 11:33.280
- Yeah, I see it now.
- Cool.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.680
What does any of this
have to do with Mr. Benson?

11:35.750 --> 11:38.380
Oh, well, he said that his
dream girl was Michelle Obama,

11:38.450 --> 11:40.950
so we hired her
celebrity look-a-like.

11:41.020 --> 11:43.720
- Looking good.
- That I understand.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.720
So how does Whoopi goldberg
and dog the bounty hunter

11:45.790 --> 11:47.590
fit into the equation?

11:47.660 --> 11:49.790
Okay, I can't believe
you're asking that question.

11:49.860 --> 11:52.290
But you know, celebrities,
they make life worth living.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.560
Do you ever read magazines?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.900
All we have to do
is show Benson a great time.

11:56.970 --> 11:58.800
- That's all we have to do.
- And then get him hooked up

11:58.870 --> 12:00.570
with the first lady.
Yeah, it's all we have to do.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.370
All right, let's do it.
Let's do it.

12:02.440 --> 12:03.640
Where's Mr. Benson?
He's having fun somewhere--

12:15.580 --> 12:16.750
- Hey.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.250
What are you doing with
a gun in here?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.750
What?
They're just blanks.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.220
Uh, who are you
even supposed to be?

12:22.290 --> 12:23.960
Isn't it obvious?

12:24.030 --> 12:25.430
Jason Statham.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.030
No, it's not obvious,

12:27.100 --> 12:28.700
'cause you don't
look anything like him.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.660
Did you even read
the post on Craigslist?

12:30.730 --> 12:33.930
Have some respect for it, man.
I look like Sean Astin.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.670
This is Macaulay Culkin.
Anyway.

12:35.740 --> 12:37.940
I was wondering if I could fire
off the gun during sex.

12:38.010 --> 12:39.640
You see, I can't
climax without it.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.440
No, you can't.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.080
They're just blanks.
In the gun, that is.

12:44.150 --> 12:45.710
My crank works just great.

12:45.780 --> 12:48.280
Okay, you know what?
Give me that.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.620
What is with
all the guns today?

12:50.690 --> 12:52.790
Fine, your house, your rules.

12:52.850 --> 12:56.260
But don't tell me I don't look
exactly like Jason Statham.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.860
You do, actually.
It's the attitude.

12:58.930 --> 13:02.430
The check won't cash
until I'm dead.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.260
And you can kill me
however you want.

13:04.330 --> 13:05.830
Sounds awesome.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.500
But what's the time frame, man?

13:07.570 --> 13:09.340
'Cause I'm going
to Mexico next weekend, so--

13:09.400 --> 13:10.840

Hey, I wouldn't blame you
if you did it, man.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.810
Ease the pain, I get it.
I'd kill my mother.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.810
Carl, I'll give you
$10,000 to kill yourself.

13:18.880 --> 13:24.020
Wow, man. Words hurt, Anders.
They hurt.

13:24.090 --> 13:25.990

taller than me, man.

13:26.050 --> 13:27.960

13:28.020 --> 13:29.860
I hate that person.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.860
But word on the street is
that you're in love

13:31.930 --> 13:33.960
with the first lady.
Uh...

13:34.030 --> 13:36.330
I wouldn't mind
ba-rocking her world.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.970
Whoa!

13:38.030 --> 13:40.370
Whoa, somebody has
had a little bit to drink.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.700
You should go get her, man.

13:42.770 --> 13:44.340
She's way outta my league.

Come on,

16:38.240 --> 16:39.400
That doesn't even make sense,
it's gibberish.

16:39.470 --> 16:41.500
Yeah, very <i>un-bueno,</i> sir.

16:41.570 --> 16:44.010
We give you the gift of life
and this is how you repay us?

16:44.080 --> 16:48.180
Don't you see, I'm freeing
you from this--this prison.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.750
This is my gift to you.
Wow, dude.

16:51.820 --> 16:55.290
You bang one chick who sort of
looks like Michelle Obama--

16:55.350 --> 16:57.950
no offense--and then
you just go totally insane.

16:58.020 --> 16:59.960
No, sweet baby prince.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.830
I've never been more sane.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.960
But seriously, I need
your buddy Carl's phone number,

17:04.030 --> 17:06.200
'cause he might still
think I want him to kill me.

17:06.260 --> 17:07.730
No, not from us.
You brought that on yourself.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.470
- Mm-hmm.
- Screw it.

17:09.530 --> 17:14.339
He's never gonna find me
in Barbados, or Prague, or...

17:14.410 --> 17:15.710
Where do you wanna go,
sweetheart?

17:15.770 --> 17:17.869
- Egypt.
- Egypt it is.

17:17.940 --> 17:19.880
- Egypt it is.
- Off to the airport, boys.

17:19.940 --> 17:21.280
- She's going to Egypt.
- Egypt.

17:21.349 --> 17:23.550
Stall him.
Like, 20 minutes.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.980
I think I might have a plan.

17:27.050 --> 17:28.380
Hey, Bruce, real quick.

17:28.450 --> 17:30.420
Hey, bud, real quick,
one more thing.

17:30.490 --> 17:32.020
Bruce, come on.

17:32.090 --> 17:34.020
Go for Carl?

17:34.090 --> 17:36.490
Hey, remember that gun I took
from Jason Statham last night?

17:36.560 --> 17:38.930
The one with the blanks?
Well, I need it.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.460
You're gonna bust in,
shoot at Bruce,

17:41.530 --> 17:45.370
I'm gonna dive in the way
and pretend to get shot.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.970
He'll owe me forever.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.240
Ha!
Sounds fool-proof, man.

17:49.310 --> 17:50.940
I'm on it.
Just give me 20 minutes.

17:51.010 --> 17:54.610
Before you go off to Egypt,
I want to show you

17:54.680 --> 17:57.310
what you're liquidating here.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.180
Or should I say who?

18:00.750 --> 18:02.950
Well, it went
straight to his voice mail,

18:03.020 --> 18:05.490
so it looks like you
are being hunted as we speak.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.360
- No, Bruce.
- Bruce, Bruce, hang on.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.230
All right, ready?
This is the deal.

18:09.290 --> 18:12.000
You gotta meet
one more person, okay?

18:12.060 --> 18:14.000
This person is the
foundation of Telamericorp...

18:14.060 --> 18:16.000
And a personal
hero of mine, a mentor.

18:16.070 --> 18:18.130
- The big boss.
- An ocean of knowledge

18:18.200 --> 18:20.440
and experience.
Martin Luther King on steroids.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.170
A father figure, yep.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.380
We give you Waymond.
Mm-hmm.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.180
Wow.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.080
Wow, Bruce, you're not
even giving Waymond a shot?

18:32.150 --> 18:35.250
Waymond's a sales machine.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.820
Everybody loves Waymond.

18:37.890 --> 18:40.790
You really care
about these people, huh?

18:40.860 --> 18:43.860
- Yes.
- Yeah.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.760
Nah.

18:46.830 --> 18:47.700
I'm still liquidating
the company.

18:47.770 --> 18:49.700
Sorry.

18:49.770 --> 18:52.440
<i>Sayonara.</i>

18:52.500 --> 18:55.040
What kind of person does that?

18:55.110 --> 18:57.140
He's here.
Come on.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.880
Wait, wait, who's he--
what's the plan?

18:58.940 --> 19:01.680
Carl's gonna fake
assassinate me, duh.

19:01.750 --> 19:04.550
Yes, that's a great plan.

19:15.960 --> 19:17.830
No!

19:17.900 --> 19:19.730
I tried to call!

19:19.800 --> 19:22.730
Mike said he left a message!

19:30.210 --> 19:31.910
Wait, wait!

19:31.980 --> 19:34.280
It's the wrong gun!
It's the wrong gun!

19:43.450 --> 19:47.390
Uh, you shot me,
you dumb idiot!

19:48.930 --> 19:51.490
- What the...?
- See ya.

19:56.030 --> 19:59.500
Somebody call 9-1-1!

19:59.570 --> 20:01.500
You saved my life.

20:01.570 --> 20:03.770
Yes, but...

20:03.840 --> 20:05.780
It's nothing you wouldn't
have done for me, right?

20:05.840 --> 20:08.480
Telamericorp family.

20:08.550 --> 20:10.610
Anything you want, buddy.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.020
You want to come to Egypt?
You want ten grand?

20:13.080 --> 20:15.020
How about you just go upstairs,

20:15.090 --> 20:16.820
and talk to the investors,
and tell them

20:16.890 --> 20:18.890
you're not liquidating
the company, all right?

20:18.960 --> 20:21.090
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I can do that.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.230
Yeah, that's a great idea,
but we also want ten grand.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.590
- And Egypt. Hi--
- Yeah.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.130
And if you could bring
the troops home,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.630
that'd be great as well.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.100
We could just
package deal, right?

20:29.170 --> 20:31.430
You knuckleheads.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.940
- How you doing?
- Ah, gross!

20:35.010 --> 20:36.570
Are you sure
it just grazed him?

20:36.640 --> 20:37.610
It looks like
he's losing a lot of blood.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.240
No, that's just ketchup,

20:39.310 --> 20:40.840
but it's seeping
into my cut and it burns!

20:40.910 --> 20:42.450
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!

20:42.510 --> 20:44.380
I don't have insurance,
how much does this cost?

20:44.450 --> 20:46.320
- About $900.
- $900?

20:46.380 --> 20:48.350
Really?

20:48.420 --> 20:50.890
Looks like it's time to put
your money where your mouth is.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.620
You, guys.
I said $9,000.

20:53.690 --> 20:55.630
- Adam?
- It's for a good cause.
