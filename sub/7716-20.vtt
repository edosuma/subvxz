00:01.419 --> 00:04.047
Hey, Jim, Stanley's back
from the hospital today.

00:04.130 --> 00:05.548
Can you sign his card?
Oh, great.

00:07.592 --> 00:10.762
"Glad they didn't mix up your
tonsillectomy with a mustachectomy."

00:12.681 --> 00:13.682
That's not good.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.059
Oh, because your jokes
are all hilarious.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.435
It's nice.
It's funny.

00:17.519 --> 00:18.937
It mentions his
tonsillectomy and makes

00:19.020 --> 00:20.438
a funny little joke
about his mustache.

00:20.897 --> 00:22.107
Stanley doesn't
have a mustache.

00:24.401 --> 00:25.443
Yeah, he does.

00:25.527 --> 00:28.822
Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley
does not have a mustache.

00:29.989 --> 00:35.453
I misspoke, I'm not sure. I think he has one...
I think he has a mustache.

00:35.662 --> 00:37.539
Okay, Phyllis sits
across from him every day.

00:37.622 --> 00:38.957
Phyllis, does he
have a mustache or not?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.626
Oh, I don't know.
Now I think he doesn't.

00:42.168 --> 00:43.753
Phyllis,
what are you talking...

00:43.837 --> 00:45.797
The whole card
depends on this.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.507
Okay, the man's
worked here for 25 years.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.300
How can none of us
picture his face?

00:49.384 --> 00:50.885
Because we come
here to do our jobs.

00:50.969 --> 00:53.138
We don't stick our noses
in other people's business.

00:53.513 --> 00:56.391
Okay. Which one of these
looks more right?

00:56.474 --> 00:57.767
Neither of those
looks like any person

00:57.851 --> 00:59.394
that has ever
existed or been dreamt of

00:59.477 --> 01:01.020
in the history
of human insanity.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.605
That said,
the one on the left.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.735
Guys, that's the elevator.
What if it's him?

01:06.818 --> 01:08.987
Okay, quick,
who says "mustache"?

01:10.113 --> 01:11.114
Yep.

01:11.656 --> 01:13.158
Who says "no mustache"?

01:20.749 --> 01:21.750
Ah!

01:21.958 --> 01:24.002
Hey!
He does have one.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.086
Yes!

01:26.671 --> 01:28.047
Welcome back, Stanley.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.518
"Good morning, Robert,"
says no one

01:40.602 --> 01:43.062
because our receptionist
is in Florida.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.613
Pam!
Oh!

01:52.405 --> 01:56.951
Is this a video conference you're having
with "Drake featuring Swizz Beatz"?

01:57.494 --> 01:59.704
Um, no, I was just
having a cup of coffee

01:59.788 --> 02:00.997
kind of warming up
for the day.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.833
People, you should come
to work already warm.

02:04.042 --> 02:08.671
9:00 to 10:00 a.m. is the most productive
potential that human beings...

02:08.755 --> 02:10.965
Sorry! Sorry,
everyone, I'm late,

02:11.049 --> 02:14.803
but you are all here, so no harm
done at all by my lateness.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.055
Nellie, really, 9:50.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.307
Oh, here's
what happened.

02:19.390 --> 02:23.645
7:46, my alarm clock goes off,
I hear it, whack the snooze.

02:24.062 --> 02:28.149
Nine minutes. Buzz,
off it goes again, whack.

02:28.233 --> 02:32.612
Seven more times I did that.
Buzz, whack, buzz, whack.

02:33.446 --> 02:35.615
By the time I got up,
it was 10 minutes ago.

02:35.698 --> 02:38.243
No will power.
That is my curse.

02:38.493 --> 02:41.496
I've never believed will power
was very important in a woman.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.543
I don't think you would
have shown up to work

02:46.626 --> 02:48.753
nearly an hour late
for no reason.

02:49.045 --> 02:50.630
Oh, I assure you
I would have done.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.924
I did. And I'll keep doing it.

02:53.258 --> 02:56.302
No, no, there's something going
on, some stress in your life.

02:56.761 --> 03:02.475
Well, yes, there is the whole
moving to Scranton nonsense.

03:02.767 --> 03:07.480
Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from
England and two trunks from Florida.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.691
Then, I have to
move into my apartment

03:09.774 --> 03:12.944
in this dreadful,
God knows where it is,

03:13.111 --> 03:15.071
backwater,
suburb of a suburb,

03:15.488 --> 03:16.739
and I mean, no
offense, but are there

03:16.823 --> 03:19.200
a lot of Irish people
living around here?

03:19.450 --> 03:20.785
- Yes.
- Oh!

03:21.202 --> 03:23.246
I hate that.
No offense.

03:23.496 --> 03:24.539
None taken.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.292
Actually, Nellie, this monologue
you're delivering is very offensive.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.962
Ooh! Ay caramba! The natives
are getting restless.

03:31.296 --> 03:32.589
Who's a native?

03:33.089 --> 03:35.466
Excuse me, the tone here
is getting quite hostile.

03:35.675 --> 03:37.552
I would appreciate it if
you would keep that stuff

03:37.635 --> 03:39.137
on the basketball court.

03:39.470 --> 03:40.972
What does that mean?
Okay, okay.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.850
If you'd let me finish.

03:43.933 --> 03:48.354
Or the squash court or
the supreme court. Hmm?

03:49.606 --> 03:51.482
Nellie?
Yes, Robert.

03:52.317 --> 03:56.362
You're clearly under a lot
of stress with the moving

03:56.446 --> 04:00.158
and the work situation
you've found yourself in.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.284
Yeah.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.952
Let's help her out,
shall we?

04:03.161 --> 04:05.747
Go above and beyond today

04:05.830 --> 04:09.292
to show her some of that
warm Scranton hospitality.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.171
Jim, Dwight, take the day.

04:13.254 --> 04:17.008
Help Nellie move those
boxes into her new place.

04:17.508 --> 04:18.509
Why Jim?
What?

04:18.718 --> 04:22.430
The rest of you, let's throw a
party at the end of the day

04:22.513 --> 04:25.433
to welcome the newest member
of our little community.

04:26.601 --> 04:28.728
I'm sorry, we're throwing
a party for someone

04:28.811 --> 04:30.188
because they're
being horrible?

04:30.271 --> 04:32.148
I'm sorry.
We're taking work time

04:32.231 --> 04:34.442
to move someone's personal
belongings into their new apartment.

04:34.567 --> 04:36.319
I'm still not sure why
this woman is even here!

04:36.444 --> 04:37.695
Why is she here?

04:38.529 --> 04:42.033
Two crazy kids
on the journey of life

04:42.116 --> 04:45.078
Going to Pennsylvania

04:45.244 --> 04:47.664
On the road with
my new girlfriend.

04:48.373 --> 04:52.126
But first, a small pit stop to break
up with my current girlfriend,

04:52.210 --> 04:55.296
who is at her parents' cabin
in southern Pennsylvania.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.631
Oh, that must be nice.

04:56.714 --> 04:57.799
Mmm-hmm.

04:57.882 --> 05:01.552
It's a beautiful place. Great
place to let her down easy.

05:01.636 --> 05:04.389
Oh, no, no, I meant that must
be nice to have parents.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.556
Oh. Hmm.

05:06.808 --> 05:09.435
Time to have a little kiss

05:09.519 --> 05:10.645
No.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.313
Mmm. Sorry, right.

05:12.438 --> 05:14.023
No kisses until the
breakup is official. Yes.

05:14.107 --> 05:15.316
I believe in that.
Yes, so do I.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.569
I think that's important. That is important.
Bummer, but important.

05:18.695 --> 05:20.071
Important.
Mmm-hmm.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.824
I can't believe he's making
us throw a party for her.

05:22.907 --> 05:23.992
I know. Right?

05:24.075 --> 05:25.410
She's always late,
she's always rude.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.620
It kind of makes me want to
throw a really bad party.

05:27.704 --> 05:28.705
Yeah.

05:28.830 --> 05:29.872
On purpose.

05:30.707 --> 05:31.874
Phyllis.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.211
We should do it right
here in the break room.

05:35.461 --> 05:36.629
Ooh!

05:37.213 --> 05:38.506
Order carrot cake.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.386
And Jessica,
just so you know,

05:43.469 --> 05:46.973
this is way more about my love for
Erin than anything wrong with you.

05:47.056 --> 05:51.060
Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did
this in the best way possible,

05:51.144 --> 05:56.482
and I knew you as a lover and
I'll remember you as a gentleman.

05:56.566 --> 05:58.901
Okay. That was one
minute and 10 seconds.

05:58.985 --> 06:00.611
Consider it nailed.

06:02.447 --> 06:03.740
I think we
should try it again.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.324
This time,
worst case scenario.

06:05.575 --> 06:09.245
Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry.
I just need you to know...

06:09.328 --> 06:10.955
What?

06:11.456 --> 06:12.707
I just need
you to know...

06:12.790 --> 06:14.792
What? I didn't
sleep well last night.

06:20.798 --> 06:21.924
Ow!

06:22.425 --> 06:24.635
Nellie, that reminds me, do you
want this chair in the bedroom?

06:24.719 --> 06:26.304
'Cause I don't think it's going
to fit through the door.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.973
Don't listen to Jim. Have you
ever seen him play Tetris?

06:29.057 --> 06:31.726
"Oh, I think I'll just
use this line horizontally.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.437
"Oh, I have no idea
what a gift this line is."

06:34.520 --> 06:35.605
That was one time.

06:35.688 --> 06:38.816
I will get the chair in. Watch the
great "Schrut-ini" work his magic.

06:39.067 --> 06:42.570
Oh, no, really? Magic, no,
no, no, let's not go there.

06:43.154 --> 06:46.949
No, nothing is more
repellent than magicians.

06:47.033 --> 06:49.368
Bunch of grown men,
waving wands,

06:49.452 --> 06:51.454
pulling bunnies
out of body crevices.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.748
Magicians are repulsive.
Next topic.

06:54.916 --> 06:56.000
Excuse me, one second.

06:57.794 --> 06:59.754
- Hi.
- Hey, what's up?

06:59.837 --> 07:02.090
Oh, nothing, just hauling
some cube with Dwight.

07:02.173 --> 07:03.674
Hauling cube!

07:03.758 --> 07:04.842
That's moving boxes.

07:04.926 --> 07:06.886
We just came up with the term
to make it sound cooler.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.679
So, we're planning
this party for Nellie,

07:08.763 --> 07:11.390
and we're going to
make it really bad.

07:11.474 --> 07:12.517
It sounds like
every other party.

07:12.892 --> 07:14.769
No, we're going to
make it like a prank,

07:14.852 --> 07:17.855
like order bad food, give her
this passive-aggressive card.

07:18.064 --> 07:19.941
Oh, hire a magician.

07:20.024 --> 07:21.109
What?

07:21.192 --> 07:23.152
Trust me.
Okay.

07:30.952 --> 07:34.330
Wow, there's a lot of cars here.
This is just weird.

07:36.249 --> 07:39.710
Andy. Hi, what are
you doing here?

07:39.877 --> 07:41.462
Hey, Lauren,
look at you.

07:41.587 --> 07:43.214
I know, look at me.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.216
I'm just on my way back
from this business trip,

07:45.299 --> 07:46.884
thought I'd stop
and say hi to Jessica.

07:47.051 --> 07:48.052
Aw!

07:48.344 --> 07:50.805
Why is Erin with me?
That's a great question.

07:50.888 --> 07:55.560
She is my co-worker and she needed a
ride, because she totaled her car.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.145
Oh, God.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.522
So I'm Erin.
Yeah, this is Erin.

07:59.605 --> 08:00.857
Hi. Nice to meet you.

08:02.191 --> 08:06.445
Well, Jess went out for a run,
but she'll be back soon.

08:06.529 --> 08:07.530
Mmm-hmm.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.907
Hey, ladies,
Andy's here.

08:10.950 --> 08:14.203
Okay, Andy, that is
a bachelorette party.

08:14.287 --> 08:17.832
This is Jessica's friends, and they've
been drinking during the daytime.

08:17.915 --> 08:18.916
Should we go?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.042
Yeah.

08:20.585 --> 08:22.545
You know, we had such a quick
window to make this work.

08:22.628 --> 08:23.671
I think we should
probably just...

08:23.754 --> 08:27.842
Oh, Jess, look who stopped
by after his business trip.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.468
Andy, hey.

08:31.429 --> 08:34.974
I wonder if king-sized sheets are
called presidential-sized in England.

08:36.309 --> 08:37.643
I really should have
a "Tweeter" account.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.854
Yes, you should.

08:41.772 --> 08:42.773
Ooh!

08:46.611 --> 08:47.778
I have to see
these shoes.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.030
I doubt that they're...

08:50.531 --> 08:51.532
Oh.

08:53.284 --> 08:54.744
Who is this guy?

08:56.162 --> 08:58.039
There's the two of them
taking a hike.

08:58.122 --> 08:59.916
I'm guessing he's
some kind of friend.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.667
Boyfriend.

09:01.876 --> 09:03.711
Here's the two of them
kissing at a beach

09:03.794 --> 09:06.172
and kissing at
the Eiffel Tower.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.633
I'm guessing he's some kind
of close, romantic friend.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.092
Like a boyfriend?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.553
You read my mind.
Yeah.

09:13.221 --> 09:15.932
Whoa. Here's one with
his face whited out.

09:16.015 --> 09:17.058
Hmm.

09:17.141 --> 09:18.267
Maybe someone threw
a pie in his face.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.603
New theory, he's a hated
Italian politician.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.271
Better theory,
this is her ex-boyfriend,

09:22.355 --> 09:23.856
and they went through some
kind of painful breakup.

09:25.066 --> 09:26.067
- Oh.
- Nellie,

09:26.859 --> 09:28.736
so sorry,
we were just...

09:29.320 --> 09:31.322
I see you've
discovered Benjamin.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.407
That's what I call my box
full of photos of Henry.

09:34.951 --> 09:36.494
Why not call...
Shh.

09:38.746 --> 09:42.416
God, we owned
this flat together.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.169
Then one morning, just
like that, he was gone.

09:45.253 --> 09:47.088
He ran off with a waitress
at our favorite restaurant.

09:47.672 --> 09:49.298
That's awful.

09:50.841 --> 09:51.926
What kind of restaurant?

09:52.009 --> 09:53.010
Dwight.

09:53.219 --> 09:56.514
I couldn't afford the flat myself.
So I sold it at a loss.

09:57.014 --> 09:59.267
Ah, but what's 10 years
of bliss down the drain

09:59.350 --> 10:03.020
compared with the thrill of starting
over with nothing and no one?

10:03.479 --> 10:06.357
I'm so sorry. These must
be very painful memories.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.276
If it would
help you to forget,

10:08.359 --> 10:11.070
I could hit you in the brain
stem with this candlestick.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.365
Thank you. No.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.788
Look, Jim, Dwight, please,
don't tell anyone about this.

10:20.955 --> 10:22.206
No, no, of course.

10:24.041 --> 10:28.713
Just one quick question,
was this Halloween or...

10:28.796 --> 10:30.715
God, no.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.092
That's the most embarrassing
thing of all of this.

10:33.426 --> 10:36.679
What kind of fool gets her heart
broken by a bloody stage magician?

10:39.181 --> 10:42.226
You know what, Pam? I was thinking
maybe we should change course here.

10:42.310 --> 10:43.394
Let's give up on
all this mean stuff.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.647
What? No. No. I just
had this brilliant idea.

10:46.731 --> 10:47.857
Everyone loved it.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.984
You don't have
a copyright on pranks.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.111
I might be better
at this than you.

10:52.403 --> 10:54.405
No, that's not... Jim,
could you give us a hand?

10:54.488 --> 10:55.698
Absolutely. Yeah.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.867
Call it off, Pam.
Call it off, okay?

10:57.950 --> 10:59.118
It's way more complicated
than you think.

10:59.285 --> 11:00.786
Cancel the magician.
Trust me.

11:00.870 --> 11:03.831
Oh, okay.
Okay, I will.

11:06.584 --> 11:07.710
That's a great idea.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.295
Yeah. Okay.

11:09.420 --> 11:10.588
- Pam, we have a great idea.
- Listen to this.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.590
We're going to have the
fluorescent lights flickering.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.966
It's going to
make everyone sick.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.218
Or what if...
Okay.

11:16.302 --> 11:22.266
...we discuss the idea of doing
the party totally normal.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.602
Like, not mean.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.771
Just a regular party.

11:27.855 --> 11:28.898
Not mean.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.650
I knew she'd crack. I wanted
to leave you out, you know.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.403
We're in far too deep. We can't
change course at this point.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.947
What are you talking about?
Of course we can.

11:37.031 --> 11:38.157
What I mean to say is
we don't want to.

11:38.449 --> 11:40.868
Toots, we're not stopping this
train, so get off the tracks.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.537
Suck it!

11:45.539 --> 11:46.540
Andy.

11:47.041 --> 11:50.378
It'll be fine. Just act natural.
Do you want a gummy penis?

11:50.795 --> 11:52.797
No. I'll just have
some gummy bears.

11:53.005 --> 11:54.048
These are delicious.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.383
But they're penises.

11:55.841 --> 11:57.843
And we come to Matthew,

11:57.927 --> 11:59.595
the guy who was
with his old girlfriend

11:59.678 --> 12:01.555
basically the whole time
we were together.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.015
Oh, no.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.478
Eww! That seems gross
at first blush, right?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.981
But relationships are always
more complicated than you think.

12:11.482 --> 12:13.859
I mean, we don't know Matthew's
history with this other woman.

12:14.819 --> 12:17.947
Maybe she saved his life.
I don't know.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.573
I just...
I don't think we should

12:19.657 --> 12:20.866
rush to judgment
about Matthew.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.159
Maybe we don't
pop that one.

12:22.368 --> 12:24.078
No. Pop it.
Pop it!

12:24.161 --> 12:25.204
LAUREN; Pop it!

12:27.790 --> 12:29.041
HEY
HEY

12:29.125 --> 12:30.626
Sorry. It's kind of a mad house.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.380
Oh, Megan.

12:34.713 --> 12:37.258
You are one of the good
ones, Nard Dog. Aw!

12:37.341 --> 12:39.176
No, really.
Where's my Andy?

12:39.969 --> 12:41.387
He's out there.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.431
Are you going to
sing for us?

12:43.848 --> 12:46.976
Well, you guys are doing a pretty good
job with the scary yelling, so...

12:47.059 --> 12:51.105
That's not like you. That's not like you.
Come on, sing! Sing!

12:51.188 --> 12:57.361
By yon bonnie banks
and by yon bonnie braes

12:57.862 --> 12:59.989
Okay, they're almost here.
What?

13:01.157 --> 13:03.367
Come on! If you guys
are going to be mean,

13:03.451 --> 13:04.743
can't you at least
be subtle?

13:05.703 --> 13:08.581
Oh, in the warehouse,
we'd use code names

13:08.664 --> 13:10.249
for people we
wanted to talk about.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.043
Andy was "Jelly Roll." Mike
was "Dennis the Menace."

13:13.669 --> 13:14.670
Ryan was "Douche Bag."

13:15.004 --> 13:17.756
Hey, that's not a code name.
That's just an insult.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.633
Plus, everyone would know
who you meant. Yeah.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.303
No, that's a great idea.
Yes, let's have a code name.

13:22.386 --> 13:26.098
How about "Mondays"? I hate Mondays.
Mondays are the worst.

13:26.182 --> 13:27.183
Nobody's named Monday.

13:27.391 --> 13:30.436
Hey, how about we go with "Pam"?
Simple, easy to remember.

13:30.895 --> 13:33.147
Because there's someone
already here named Pam.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.231
Shh. Here she comes.

13:34.315 --> 13:35.316
Hey.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.234
Welcome to your party.

13:37.568 --> 13:41.322
Everybody, get comfy now. This first
song's over a half-hour long.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.998
Best gig ever. They asked
me to play only originals.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.834
I said, "Have you heard my originals?
They're terrible."

13:53.918 --> 13:59.089
They said, "Even better." I said, "I get it.
It's an ironic party for Nellie."

13:59.924 --> 14:01.258
Maybe we should just go.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.718
No, I got to do this.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.222
Hey, Jessica,
can I talk to you?

14:06.347 --> 14:07.973
Uh, yeah, sure,
what's up?

14:08.057 --> 14:09.558
Maybe we could
talk in private.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.477
Yeah, what is it?

14:12.394 --> 14:14.230
Well, first,
let me just say that

14:14.313 --> 14:17.900
I hope when I'm done with
the sort of ugly bits,

14:17.983 --> 14:19.777
that we can
stay friends.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.028
You're breaking up
with me?

14:21.445 --> 14:22.530
Uh...

14:22.613 --> 14:24.281
No. No.

14:24.949 --> 14:27.868
You always do this.
You twist my words around.

14:27.952 --> 14:29.954
Part of me thinks we should
just end this right now.

14:30.371 --> 14:34.375
Oh, my God. Are you
leaving me for Erin?

14:34.458 --> 14:37.378
You said she wasn't relationship
material, and she wasn't as good as me.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.712
But it's her, isn't it?

14:38.796 --> 14:39.797
Whoa.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.176
That... No.
Okay, you want honesty?

14:44.385 --> 14:47.930
Super honesty time.
I'm gay.

14:48.556 --> 14:49.557
What?

14:50.474 --> 14:53.102
I am gay and
I prefer men.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.186
I knew it!

14:54.270 --> 14:55.479
You did not, Kenny.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.273
You invited me to
go shopping with you.

14:57.356 --> 15:01.652
I like hanging outwith you.
You're a cool guy.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.779
Which proves my point
that I'm gay.

15:03.988 --> 15:05.990
Andy, you're not gay.

15:06.073 --> 15:11.287
I mean, we were together and
you seemed pretty excitable.

15:11.370 --> 15:15.499
Well, I was faking it.
I had to fake it every time.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.669
I had to imagine that I was in
a steam room with John Stamos.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.840
I can't say it
doesn't make sense.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.385
Well, I mean, I was
good at hiding it...

15:26.468 --> 15:28.304
It's fine, Andy.

15:29.013 --> 15:31.599
I didn't think we were going
to get married or anything.

15:31.682 --> 15:34.810
I just...
I'm just upset for now.

15:35.185 --> 15:40.190
Understandable, and I'm really sorry.
I really am.

15:44.028 --> 15:47.781
So, we should probably go.

15:55.873 --> 15:59.126
This humble
but sincere effort is

15:59.209 --> 16:02.046
all for our valued new colleague.
Excellent.

16:02.755 --> 16:05.382
To Nellie Bertram,
you are a most welcome

16:05.466 --> 16:07.384
and friendly presence
at our company.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.219
Cheers.
Why, thank you.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.349
Pam, on the other hand,
is a most unwelcome,

16:13.474 --> 16:17.061
entitled and unfriendly
presence in our company.

16:17.186 --> 16:18.562
Cheers.

16:20.439 --> 16:24.026
Nellie is terrific,
but to be honest,

16:24.109 --> 16:27.321
every day, I imagine how
happy I'd be if Pam died.

16:29.323 --> 16:35.162
Oh, well, I feel that as
someone who knows Pam,

16:35.245 --> 16:40.125
only a little bit, enough, a good
amount, not the most, though,

16:40.250 --> 16:42.127
I would say that
she is misunderstood,

16:42.670 --> 16:45.130
and that maybe there's
some stuff in her past

16:45.214 --> 16:46.965
that you guys
don't know about

16:47.049 --> 16:48.509
that's a little
messed up and probably

16:48.592 --> 16:50.219
makes her such a
torture to work with.

16:50.594 --> 16:56.058
We hate Pam! We hate Pam!
We hate Pam! We hate Pam!

16:56.392 --> 16:57.643
So we've established...

16:57.726 --> 16:58.686
No.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.771
...that you guys hate Pam.

17:01.522 --> 17:04.942
Do you ever wish she
would just disappear?

17:05.609 --> 17:06.610
Oh!

17:10.447 --> 17:11.740
That was a really
rough scene.

17:11.824 --> 17:13.617
Right? Rough scene.
Yeah.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.996
At least we can kiss now.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.456
Oh, yeah.

17:24.211 --> 17:27.756
You know, that stuff that I said
about you to her, that's just...

17:27.840 --> 17:29.133
I had to say it.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.301
You know, I was dating
her at the time.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.428
Yeah.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.930
Yes, of course.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.099
Ugh.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.225
I feel really tired.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.351
Yeah.

17:39.435 --> 17:40.477
Probably from
seeing that turkey.

17:40.561 --> 17:41.562
Oh, yeah.

17:41.645 --> 17:45.482
When we drove by the farm.
Always does that.

17:52.406 --> 17:55.033
Are you Nellie? I think
you're my volunteer.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.243
Come on
over here, huh?

17:58.162 --> 17:59.955
No, I'll do it.
I will volunteer.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.790
No, Nellie should.
No, I'll do it.

18:01.957 --> 18:08.255
Oh, big guy, huh? How's the air up there?
Watch out for birds.

18:09.923 --> 18:13.427
All right, let's do
some card magic.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.596
Now, what I want
you to do is,

18:15.679 --> 18:18.307
I want you to pick a card
just by looking at it.

18:18.432 --> 18:20.851
Do not say what it is.

18:23.687 --> 18:24.688
It's the four of hearts.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.565
Oh, no, it's...

18:26.648 --> 18:30.110
Looks like we got a guy from
another country here, huh?

18:30.235 --> 18:33.447
No hablo el cardo, seÃ±ior?

18:34.364 --> 18:38.911
All right, the card is picked. Now,
sir, will you please shuffle the deck?

18:45.542 --> 18:47.878
You didn't just do that
on purpose, did you?

18:48.045 --> 18:50.923
Why is Jim treating
the magician poorly?

18:51.048 --> 18:53.759
Little known fact about me,
before I was a magician,

18:53.842 --> 18:56.804
I used to work
at a rope factory.

18:56.887 --> 18:59.056
Not true because
that's not a real place.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.976
But I never could seem to
figure out those knots.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.978
That's not a real knot. When
you pull on it, it disappears.

19:05.062 --> 19:06.063
What the hell?

19:07.231 --> 19:09.608
All right! Where's Phyllis?
Who's Phyllis?

19:10.776 --> 19:15.823
Look, this is really uncool, okay?
I put on a clean show here...

19:15.906 --> 19:17.908
Okay, scram, wizard!
What?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.076
You heard me!

19:19.243 --> 19:21.912
Wow. Nellie, I'm sorry.
If I'd known

19:21.995 --> 19:24.665
Jim and Pam
would use this party

19:24.748 --> 19:26.875
as an excuse to
abuse a magician...

19:27.000 --> 19:29.586
Well, I thought
it was quite fun.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.965
In fact, I think they're brilliant
employees in their own way.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.342
Don't you see
what I see?

19:35.717 --> 19:38.720
Interesting, yes.
No, yes, I see that.

19:39.721 --> 19:43.141
Great work, team.
Great party.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.019
You think this
is a great party?

19:46.103 --> 19:50.566
This cake has vegetables in
it, like a salad bar, Robert.

19:50.649 --> 19:53.235
How do I get this
taste out of my mouth?

19:57.281 --> 19:58.782
What? Why are we...

19:58.866 --> 20:00.325
I just got to do
one thing.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.000
Oh, hello.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.210
Hey, everybody,
look who's here.

20:10.294 --> 20:11.336
What are you doing here?

20:11.670 --> 20:15.716
Hi. Super duper honesty
time, I'm not gay.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.886
In fact, I'm so not gay that
I'm in love with a girl.

20:18.969 --> 20:22.097
Her name is Erin Hannon,
and she is right there.

20:22.180 --> 20:25.058
She's sweet,
funny and beautiful

20:25.142 --> 20:26.894
and total
relationship material.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.521
Why the hell did
you come back here?

20:29.897 --> 20:30.939
Go away.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.024
Get lost.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.400
Get out!
Okay.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.027
You're done! Get out!
Bye, guys. Go. Go.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.153
You ruined my party.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.573
Who does that?
Are you kidding me?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.116
Yeah, run away.
Run away!

20:41.199 --> 20:42.409
You're disgusting!

20:42.492 --> 20:44.369
I can't believe
you're not gay!

20:45.704 --> 20:46.788
Yeah,
get out of here.

20:46.872 --> 20:47.956
Don't come back!

20:50.709 --> 20:51.919
Uh-oh.

20:52.461 --> 20:53.712
You don't even
know how to drive!

20:54.338 --> 20:56.256
Loser! Nice car!

21:03.013 --> 21:04.806
Hey, Hank.
Yes, ma'am.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.852
I thought I was very specific about
you not letting up a magician.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.979
Yes, ma'am,
I got my eyes open.

21:11.355 --> 21:13.357
Well, turns out he
actually made it up there.

21:13.649 --> 21:15.192
What? That ain't right.

21:15.525 --> 21:16.735
Yeah, he came and went.

21:18.362 --> 21:22.032
Wait a minute, you said
it was a magician, right?

21:23.033 --> 21:25.744
You don't think he could have used...
It couldn't have been...
