02:23.936 --> 02:25.354
Yeah.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.523
Her session just ended.

02:28.440 --> 02:30.276
We're heading home now.
Yeah, OK.

02:43.706 --> 02:44.915
Here comes
my handsome son!

Dial 8282

02:46.208 --> 02:47.251
Hi!

02:47.251 --> 02:50.671
I was just wondering what song it is
the jonghwa sings all the time?

02:50.921 --> 02:53.340
It's from a TV commercial in Korea.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.842
OK.
Good bye!

02:54.842 --> 02:56.677
Go... go...

02:57.344 --> 03:01.515
Hurry to Loan Loan King.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.184
There's a car coming.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.533
What is it, Jong-hwa?

03:31.337 --> 03:33.839
I was afraid
you might get hurt.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.470
Mom is sorry, okay?

03:41.639 --> 03:44.308
Mom is sorry.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.018
Yes, sorry.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.812
Mom is sorry.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.024
Mom is sorry.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.945
Mom is sorry.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.505
Kids who went to the camp
said it's great.

04:14.630 --> 04:15.798
You'll have fun.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.010
I'm worried you'll like it so much
you won't come back.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.641
I love you.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.771
Speedy Loan Loan King

05:14.064 --> 05:15.065
Please..

05:15.399 --> 05:18.527
I'm afraid not.
You have to follow our rules.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.572
I'll just watch from a distance.

05:21.739 --> 05:23.115
I won't get in your way

05:23.615 --> 05:26.785
Yes.. But there's no point to this camp,
if parents comes along.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.539
You just have to trust us
and let us take care of him

05:30.748 --> 05:33.417
I promise.
I won't be in your way.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.794
My son needs me with him.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.840
If you're this concerned, then maybe
you should take him home with you

05:41.717 --> 05:42.718
Pardon?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.846
Think about the reason
you came all the way here.

05:47.139 --> 05:51.101
No interest for
first two months

05:51.435 --> 05:53.896
regardless of credit rating...

06:07.910 --> 06:08.952
Excuse me.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.539
Do you have a light?

06:30.391 --> 06:31.475
Thank you

06:34.144 --> 06:35.729
You're from Korea, right?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.483
Yes.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.616
Is the camp far from here?

06:48.826 --> 06:51.745
It's near Tampere.
It'll take 3 to 4 hours.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.679
You're really okay with this?

07:09.763 --> 07:11.014
Yes.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.937
Anyway...

07:16.979 --> 07:18.981
You thanked me already.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.540
Are you sure we're going
in the right direction?

07:38.459 --> 07:39.626
Yes.

07:46.550 --> 07:49.178
You don't talk much.

07:51.221 --> 07:52.973
Not really.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.288
It's over there.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.591
It's dangerous.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.596
No, it's not. You can come.

09:21.979 --> 09:23.772
Let's go to the camp.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.775
Across this lake?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.278
We need to get to the kids.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.992
We can go by car,
but let's try this way.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.084
Just kidding.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.733
Let's go back now.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.361
We're not seeing the kids?

10:11.778 --> 10:13.405
It's okay.
I've seen where they are.

10:30.047 --> 10:31.256
Your coffee.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.759
Only one cup?

10:33.759 --> 10:36.178
I don't drink coffee
because of my stomach.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.181
But all they have to eat
are sandwiches.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.016
Coffee is enough.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.268
I think you should eat
something warm.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.272
That would be nice,
but we'd better hurry.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.691
Shall we?

10:49.775 --> 10:52.361
How about finding
a place to eat first?

10:54.905 --> 10:57.240
My treat.
You drove all this way.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.175
This kind of food
don't suit me.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.135
My tastes are too Korean.

11:17.803 --> 11:20.347
I like soybean paste
and that sort of thing.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.267
So when I go abroad,
I carry around red-pepper paste.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.436
Do you have it with you?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.730
Why?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.774
May I have it?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.216
Is it good?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.968
Yes.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.362
So you've been here two years.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.157
Is life better here?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.161
Well, it's alright.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.496
It took some time
getting used to it.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.332
But life is the same everywhere.

12:34.171 --> 12:35.338
What?

12:37.799 --> 12:40.969
What kind of answer is that?
Vague and thoughtless.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.850
I mean, it's nice.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.351
Quiet and clean.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.355
Lots of snow...

13:06.953 --> 13:09.039
The road's blocked,
we need to wait.

13:10.332 --> 13:11.542
Until when?

13:12.584 --> 13:16.880
It has to stop snowing first,
so they don't know yet.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.508
What shall we do...?

13:20.133 --> 13:24.387
You can probably catch a train
at Tampere.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.972
Let's try that.

13:27.224 --> 13:29.309
And you stay here alone?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.228
I guess.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.438
It's a common thing here.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.942
Then I'll wait with you.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.277
It might take really long.

13:39.277 --> 13:42.072
It's alright,
we're near the camp anyways.

13:43.949 --> 13:47.619
I'll bet the kids
are doing better than we are.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.474
So did your girl get better
living here?

14:10.225 --> 14:13.061
Well, yes and no.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.231
- Another vague answer.
- No, I mean it.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.902
You can't see progress on
the outside.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.281
Depression isn't cured easily.

14:27.075 --> 14:33.039
Oh, I thought she was like my son,
being at the same school.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.961
The condition of my son is...

14:39.379 --> 14:41.548
really quite bad.

14:55.145 --> 14:59.065
Since coming here,
I check the time constantly.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.987
I've lost all sense of
if it's day or night.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.490
I've been there, too.

16:04.047 --> 16:06.675
- You're up.
- Hi...

16:13.056 --> 16:14.641
Why are you up so early?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.727
I thought I'd take a walk.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.265
We walked quite a bit,
are you okay?

17:38.141 --> 17:39.601
I'm fine.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.771
The place I work
is by a mountain.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.148
So every clay I walk
up and down the hill.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.651
Which mountain?

17:50.153 --> 17:51.654
Mt. Namsan.

17:54.324 --> 17:55.825
You can call it a mountain, too.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.882
Look.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.595
I think it's a sauna.

18:22.852 --> 18:24.270
Are you okay?

18:50.672 --> 18:52.674
Is it okay to just come in?

18:53.508 --> 18:54.759
Don't know.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.905
Someone's just been here.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.261
A sauna deep in the forest...

19:38.761 --> 19:41.347
People here love saunas.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.686
They say Finns build themselves
saunas before houses.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.525
Even 100 years ago,
women gave birth in saunas.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.447
They even have a legend

19:57.447 --> 20:01.784
about 'Saunatonttu',
an elf living in the sauna.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.873
If people are naughty here,
the elf gets angry and...

20:54.671 --> 20:56.965
Sorry.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.512
What were you talking about?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.808
About...

21:08.643 --> 21:10.770
the elf in the sauna.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.564
I woke up this morning,

23:19.148 --> 23:21.484
and I was alone.

23:24.195 --> 23:29.075
I thought I'd fall apart
if my son wasn't by my side.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.037
But strangely, I felt calm.

23:34.872 --> 23:37.041
I haven't felt that before...

26:01.102 --> 26:02.937
Take care.

26:03.604 --> 26:04.939
Wait.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.651
I don't even know your name.

27:11.339 --> 27:13.007
It's me.

27:14.884 --> 27:15.718
Hey...

27:15.801 --> 27:18.804
Did I wake you up? Sorry.

27:19.764 --> 27:21.891
Today is Sunday.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.226
Is something wrong?

27:25.144 --> 27:28.689
No, I just called.

27:53.756 --> 27:55.091
Hi.

27:55.424 --> 27:59.095
My feet... ice...
Home...

27:59.095 --> 28:01.430
Your feet are cold?
Yes, let's go home.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.933
- My feet...
- Poor Jong-hwa's feet are cold?

28:09.021 --> 28:12.441
My feet... ice...

28:12.775 --> 28:16.946
No interest for

regardless of credit rating.

28:21.033 --> 28:24.870
Dial 8282

28:25.496 --> 28:28.916
Regardless of credit rating.

28:29.125 --> 28:33.212
Dial 8282

28:33.462 --> 28:36.257
Speedy Loan Loan King.

28:36.298 --> 28:42.054
Hurry to Loan Loan King.

28:49.478 --> 28:52.022
He seems to be calmer.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.110
How was it there?

28:56.444 --> 28:58.446
Okay.

28:58.946 --> 29:01.782
- Heard it's freaking cold.
- Yeah, it is.

29:02.825 --> 29:05.995
But it's nice.
Quiet and clean.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.997
Lots of snow.

29:08.539 --> 29:10.791
We have quite a lot here, too.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.461
It's different, really.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.838
What's so different?

29:19.175 --> 29:20.384
It's just...

29:22.428 --> 29:23.846
different.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.277
<i>8 MONTHS LATER</i>

29:38.360 --> 29:40.863
With this high ceiling,
it feels too big.

29:40.863 --> 29:44.492
It seems that way
because of the glass.

29:44.575 --> 29:47.578
But the mood totally changes
after sunset.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.373
How many guests
were you thinking?

29:51.540 --> 29:54.251
About 200 to 300?

29:55.044 --> 29:56.212
What do you think?

29:56.212 --> 29:59.048
I like the open space,

29:59.048 --> 30:02.802
but with a square shape
the runway and seating

30:02.843 --> 30:04.512
will be hard to arrange
in an interesting way.

30:06.555 --> 30:09.141
Shall we keep looking?
There's not much time.

30:09.308 --> 30:13.103
Finding a place with
glass walls won't be easy.

30:13.103 --> 30:18.192
And if you think about parking,
there wouldn't be

30:18.234 --> 30:20.110
better options in Seoul
for a fashion show venue.

30:20.194 --> 30:21.904
Hello, Teacher.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.114
I want to see how
it looks like in the evening.

30:24.281 --> 30:27.117
- I went to Jong-hwa's school.
- So?

30:27.576 --> 30:29.954
He tore up
his classmates' textbooks.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.290
Thank god
he didn't hit anyone.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.626
Did you pay them?

30:36.210 --> 30:39.046
I sent them the money
and gift certificates.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.881
Called all of them to apologize.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.217
Problem solved then.

30:44.134 --> 30:46.971
How about transferring
out of Gangnam district?

30:47.388 --> 30:51.267
Schools near here are more difficult,
and the parents are picky.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.563
Look, Ms. Lee Sang-min.

30:56.063 --> 30:58.440
You think that's
the real issue here?

30:59.108 --> 31:02.653
Ordinary schools will
all be the same.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.574
But we could at least try.

31:09.410 --> 31:13.122
I told you not to insist
on an ordinary school.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.124
Special schools in Korea
aren't bad.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.379
But special schools...

31:25.634 --> 31:29.680
We need to face reality.

31:31.307 --> 31:35.644
From an objective view,
this is vanity.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.647
Great, you know its name!

31:38.689 --> 31:42.109
Crabs walk sideways
like this...

31:43.027 --> 31:44.570
There are so many!

31:44.653 --> 31:47.573
Which animal is your favorite?

33:07.403 --> 33:11.031
- Hello!
- Yes? Hello.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.785
What brings you here?

33:15.202 --> 33:16.370
Pardon?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.747
What are you doing here?

33:18.747 --> 33:23.085
I was...passing by.
I had business near here.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.431
CEO Lee Sang-min.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.435
I didn't expect that.

33:41.770 --> 33:46.316
You mean the work I do
doesn't suit me?

33:47.109 --> 33:50.404
I just didn't see you
as a CEO type.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.242
What exactly does
a CEO look like?

33:57.244 --> 33:59.288
I didn't mean to...

33:59.288 --> 34:02.791
It's okay.
It's just a title.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.668
I'm hired to manage
the boutique.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.421
The real owner is someone else.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.428
Her...?

34:15.679 --> 34:17.181
Yes.

34:22.603 --> 34:25.688
Are you back for good?

34:29.650 --> 34:33.405
Yes...and no.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.245
Guess you got well.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.248
You said you don't drink coffee
because of your stomach.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.879
You remember that...

34:52.882 --> 34:54.676
The display team is here.

34:54.842 --> 34:56.887
- Shall I tell them to wait?
- Yes.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.732
You must be busy.
Go ahead.

35:13.695 --> 35:15.239
It's not a coincidence, is it?

35:19.201 --> 35:20.410
50/50.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.333
It's nice to see you.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.925
It's a little distracting
because of the reflection.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.264
Then how about taking out
some pendants?

35:40.305 --> 35:42.224
<i>IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.
KIM KI-HONG</i>

35:42.224 --> 35:43.475
What do you think?

35:44.434 --> 35:48.272
Or should we take out
all of them?

35:59.241 --> 36:00.701
This is so heavy...

36:03.245 --> 36:05.414
Where's Yoo-rim? Sleeping?

36:05.873 --> 36:07.207
Yeah.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.252
You working?

36:10.586 --> 36:11.962
Need to change the layout.

36:12.254 --> 36:13.964
Sena's giving you a hard time?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.425
You're friends,
she can go easy on you.

36:16.967 --> 36:18.969
Does she have to play the client?

36:22.264 --> 36:24.516
The wine was on sale.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.768
- You want some?
- Sure.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.777
Did you accept that job?

36:36.945 --> 36:41.283
I met them today
and asked for more time.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.536
Need to think about it.

36:44.953 --> 36:48.373
Anyway I need to finish
Sena's gallery first...

36:52.669 --> 36:54.004
Are you okay?

36:58.508 --> 37:00.802
This opener sucks.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.850
I'll do it. Leave it.

37:09.519 --> 37:13.023
I'll shower first.
Don't drink without me.

37:42.052 --> 37:45.055
<i>Why do we feel stress?</i>

37:45.347 --> 37:49.351
<i>The bottom line is
there's only one reason.</i>

37:49.643 --> 37:53.689
We want something, but because of
inner or outer obstacles,

37:53.772 --> 37:55.065
we can't get it...

37:55.315 --> 37:56.692
and we perceive
a feeling of discomfort.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.444
<i>IT'S KIM KI-HONG.
CAN WE TALK NOW?</i>

38:00.529 --> 38:02.030
Jong-hwa!

38:02.030 --> 38:03.365
No, Jong-hwa!

38:04.533 --> 38:07.077
That's not for drinking!

38:07.369 --> 38:08.578
It's dirty!

38:08.912 --> 38:10.038
Are you okay?

38:10.455 --> 38:11.957
Let me handle it.

38:12.499 --> 38:15.043
Enough, Jong-hwa.
Let's stop it.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.464
My baby will catch a cold.

38:20.382 --> 38:23.885
Let's dry your body.

38:30.475 --> 38:31.977
Oh no, Jong-hwa.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.730
Let's stop. It's dirty.

38:35.564 --> 38:36.898
Jong-hwa!

38:37.357 --> 38:39.359
Stop, Jong-hwa please!

38:55.042 --> 38:57.127
Now my son can outfight me.

39:09.973 --> 39:12.059
<i>I looked through
the pictures you sent.</i>

39:12.059 --> 39:13.894
<i>Is there any place more casual?</i>

39:13.894 --> 39:17.898
I'm on it.
Don't worry.

39:18.065 --> 39:21.109
Mr. Kim from Busan's on hold.
Will you take it?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.571
<i>Oh the second brand?
How's it going?</i>

39:24.613 --> 39:27.616
I'll go to Busan
to present it myself.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.618
<i>Good. Thanks!</i>

39:34.873 --> 39:36.041
Hello.

39:42.798 --> 39:44.049
Hello.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.055
Hello...

39:52.808 --> 39:54.726
Were you waiting for me?

39:56.186 --> 39:58.063
You can say that.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.649
You could've called.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.528
I texted you a few clays ago.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.905
But you didn't reply so...

40:07.072 --> 40:09.074
I'm sorry, I forgot.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.994
- Have you had lunch?
- Not yet.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.498
I know a nice place.
Want to go?

40:22.087 --> 40:25.090
You need to eat anyway.

40:44.734 --> 40:46.153
Lunch is ready.

40:49.906 --> 40:51.658
You said it's
a nice restaurant.

40:53.160 --> 40:54.494
Isn't it nice?

40:55.036 --> 40:57.998
Quiet, nice view.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.542
Why isn't anyone here?

41:01.001 --> 41:04.004
They went out for lunch.
One person needs to stay on site.

41:04.588 --> 41:07.883
Here.
Your favorite, soybean stew.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.555
So this is what you do.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.056
I didn't expect that.

41:16.558 --> 41:19.144
Meaning the work I do
doesn't suit me?

41:20.270 --> 41:21.563
Right.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.151
Just kidding.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.654
Oh, it's good.

41:31.573 --> 41:32.991
Do you like your job?

41:34.075 --> 41:36.077
I chose it because I liked it.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.997
But now, sometimes I do,
sometimes I don't.

41:39.581 --> 41:40.999
It's your habit.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.170
Giving vague answers.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.298
Is it?

41:50.258 --> 41:51.968
It's amazing.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.305
To have a place like this
in a container building.

41:58.934 --> 42:01.770
The containers are narrow.

42:01.978 --> 42:09.653
So we extended the deck here
like a center garden.

42:29.839 --> 42:31.132
Isn't it a little chilly?

42:36.555 --> 42:37.806
You're warmer now.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.661
So what's the progress
of the construction?

43:01.246 --> 43:02.664
About 70% clone.

44:01.014 --> 44:02.349
Did you have lunch, Ki-hong?

44:13.360 --> 44:15.236
When do we pick up the jewelry?

44:15.403 --> 44:18.657
The carving will be clone this week.
I'll go this weekend.

44:18.657 --> 44:21.201
We'd better hurry.
The boss is arriving next week.

44:21.201 --> 44:25.038
Yes, ma'am.
I should've gotten it earlier.

44:25.038 --> 44:28.375
Ran, how's the
presentation file coming?

44:28.375 --> 44:30.335
I'm working on it now.
It'll be clone tomorrow.

44:30.335 --> 44:31.753
Okay.

44:35.006 --> 44:37.342
- I'm going.
- Okay, bye.

44:37.342 --> 44:38.843
I'll wait downstairs.

44:40.261 --> 44:41.930
Are you staying?

44:41.930 --> 44:43.348
I think I should leave too.

44:43.431 --> 44:46.184
It's quite late, right?
I'm sorry.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.104
Jong-hwa fell asleep
in the fitting room again.

44:50.105 --> 44:51.272
Got it.

44:51.481 --> 44:54.025
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

44:59.114 --> 45:02.742
Shall we grab a bite?

45:02.784 --> 45:04.452
- At this hour?
- Why not?

45:37.360 --> 45:41.281
I'm here to shop for clothes.
Am I too late?

45:43.950 --> 45:45.744
We're closed.

45:48.371 --> 45:50.039
I see.

45:51.458 --> 45:53.752
Shall I come another time?

46:11.352 --> 46:15.106
What if you showed up
and I weren't here?

46:15.940 --> 46:17.275
Then I'd go home.

48:26.321 --> 48:28.239
It's true.

48:28.489 --> 48:30.158
It ended at my father.

48:30.533 --> 48:33.328
- It wasn't passed down to me.
- You're stuttering.

48:33.453 --> 48:35.288
I just have a hand tremor.

48:35.705 --> 48:36.998
Hi Mom.

48:38.166 --> 48:40.627
We'll grill the beef and stuff.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.295
You know he can cook.

48:42.337 --> 48:45.173
<i>Why do you always
make him do everything?</i>

48:47.675 --> 48:50.929
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Mom, I'll call you back.

48:52.722 --> 48:54.724
Where's your daughter?

48:55.224 --> 48:56.309
In her room.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.937
Why not have her eat with us?

48:58.937 --> 49:00.647
She's not comfortable
with strangers yet.

49:02.649 --> 49:05.485
She's a shy girl.

49:06.486 --> 49:07.946
Just like you.

49:12.033 --> 49:16.371
Should I walk naked
around the neighborhood?

49:16.371 --> 49:20.333
Stop, I brought my girlfriend!

49:20.708 --> 49:24.170
- This is really pretty.
- Isn't it?

49:24.170 --> 49:26.339
They have great furniture
in Finland.

49:26.339 --> 49:28.967
Like Alvar Aalto.
Why didn't you ship some back?

49:29.509 --> 49:34.305
I wanted to, but I couldn't.
Things were so uncertain.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.641
Why, are you going
back to Finland?

49:37.225 --> 49:38.726
Giving it some thought.

49:39.644 --> 49:42.063
But I thought you'll
join Han's company.

49:42.063 --> 49:45.149
You should decide quick.
My gallery is almost clone.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.151
- I also...
- Right?

49:47.402 --> 49:50.405
That precious gallery's
tied him up for months.

49:52.156 --> 49:56.077
I thought he came back
to Seoul for my sake.

49:57.578 --> 50:00.415
But it turns out
it was for your gallery.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.334
Or was it just an excuse

50:03.751 --> 50:06.337
for something else
between you two?

50:07.672 --> 50:10.341
I suppose that's possible.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.803
That's a bad joke.

50:20.435 --> 50:21.811
How do you say Â¡Â°CheersÂ¡Â± in Finnish?

50:22.437 --> 50:26.274
It's fine. I have a meeting
early tomorrow, that's all.

50:26.607 --> 50:29.819
Don't worry, just keep up
with the gallery work.

50:29.819 --> 50:31.029
Let's

50:31.029 --> 50:32.405
Thank you for the dinner.

50:34.407 --> 50:36.242
- Take care.
- Bye.

50:54.802 --> 50:56.304
That looks dangerous.

50:57.430 --> 50:59.807
Moon-ju!
Come down, you'll get hurt.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.476
You come up, too!

51:03.436 --> 51:04.604
Moon-ju!

51:06.272 --> 51:09.317
Such a coward!

51:09.484 --> 51:10.860
Come down, I said!

51:14.864 --> 51:16.324
Ki-hong.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.671
It's my sweet girl!

51:34.342 --> 51:36.177
Oh...you peed.

51:38.846 --> 51:42.266
Don't go! I'll be right back.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.154
If you want to see a whale

52:36.529 --> 52:39.866
you'll have to
just ignore the roses.

52:40.241 --> 52:43.870
And all their pink
and all their sweet

52:44.370 --> 52:48.541
and all their wild
and all their waving.

52:57.383 --> 52:59.886
<i>I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'RE DOING OK</i>

53:05.266 --> 53:06.350
<i>DELETE</i>

53:35.296 --> 53:36.672
Yoo-rim, what are you doing?

53:48.476 --> 53:50.770
Moon-ju! Moon-ju!

53:59.695 --> 54:02.365
You tired?
You haven't slept at all.

54:03.699 --> 54:04.867
I'm alright.

54:06.035 --> 54:09.705
I'll take her at my house
when she leaves hospital.

54:10.248 --> 54:11.624
Yoo-rim, too.

54:12.667 --> 54:14.794
Since she wants to
stay by her mom.

54:17.964 --> 54:22.510
What should I do?
Got to take care of my girl.

54:25.638 --> 54:28.349
Don't blame yourself,
it's not the first time.

54:32.353 --> 54:34.355
Her mood swings

54:34.605 --> 54:36.440
and victim mentality...

54:38.859 --> 54:41.070
She got married too young,

54:42.363 --> 54:46.867
and depended too much on you.
She could never grow up.

55:35.875 --> 55:37.877
How could you forget this?

55:38.961 --> 55:41.130
That presentation caused us
so much trouble.

55:42.798 --> 55:44.550
Come on.
I'll drive you to the station.

55:59.982 --> 56:01.484
One minute.

56:29.053 --> 56:31.722
What are you doing here?

56:38.646 --> 56:40.147
Did you eat breakfast?

56:42.191 --> 56:43.734
I'm hungry.

56:44.193 --> 56:47.738
Sorry, I don't have time.
I have a train to catch.

56:48.823 --> 56:52.201
- Going where?
- Busan. For work.

56:53.828 --> 56:55.162
I'll give you a ride.

56:55.704 --> 56:57.039
To Busan?

56:59.542 --> 57:03.003
Why not?
I gave you a ride once before.

57:05.506 --> 57:07.174
You don't have to today.

57:08.843 --> 57:10.219
Then just to the station.

57:13.055 --> 57:14.640
Sang-min!

57:20.980 --> 57:23.649
You look terrible.
You didn't even shave.

57:25.443 --> 57:26.902
What's up?

57:27.736 --> 57:28.988
Do I look that bad?

57:31.198 --> 57:32.992
Maybe because
I skipped breakfast.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.050
- Don't skip breakfast.
- Yup.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.722
And shave, too!

58:31.717 --> 58:34.261
<i>KIM KI-HONG</i>

59:16.554 --> 59:17.805
You want something to eat?

59:26.146 --> 59:27.314
Here you go.

59:53.257 --> 59:54.758
So laid-back.

59:56.176 --> 59:57.386
Me?

59:58.762 --> 01:00:01.015
You seem to have nothing
to worry about.

01:00:01.849 --> 01:00:03.934
Do I look that way?

01:00:07.396 --> 01:00:09.356
Do you work at all?

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:13.360
The construction
is almost complete.

01:00:15.362 --> 01:00:17.865
Then you're going back
to Finland?

01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:24.747
I wish I could,

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:27.875
but I don't think I can.

01:00:28.042 --> 01:00:29.376
There you go again.

01:00:30.336 --> 01:00:32.338
I can't go back
because of you.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.871
I wasn't sleeping.

01:01:07.748 --> 01:01:10.250
You even snored.
Go back to sleep.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:16.256
You're too far away.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.344
Don't want to bother you.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:51.166
You'd better go now.

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.758
I want to see you off this time.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.347
Okay then.

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:32.332
What are you drinking for?

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:37.296
Celebrating... we passed
the final building inspection.

01:02:38.839 --> 01:02:40.340
Sorry, I should've taken care of it.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.469
Forget it.
We took care of it anyhow.

01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:45.846
I assumed you couldn't make it.

01:02:47.306 --> 01:02:49.183
You look terrible.

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:55.022
Well, that's to be expected.

01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:03.530
I don't know...

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:10.204
why everything in my life
is so vague.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.832
You realize it now?

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.210
You've been that way
since you were little.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.551
I have a date. Gotta go.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:29.973
Hey...

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.604
something's different about you.

01:03:38.273 --> 01:03:40.442
It's not just because
of your wife, is it?

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:50.452
This is our first big investment
in the fashion business,

01:03:50.452 --> 01:03:54.122
so we're depending on you
for a great result.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:59.628
Money types like us should
support artists, shouldn't we?

01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:04.299
- Ms. Lee will do it great.
- We have to have good results, seriously.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:08.053
Take the call,
a busy person like you.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.227
<i>Busy?</i>

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:16.562
A little.

01:04:18.397 --> 01:04:19.606
Ah...

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:25.445
Hello?

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:28.866
<i>Did you drink?</i>

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.954
Yes... a little.

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:39.042
Get some rest.
You looked really tired.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.298
I just...

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.134
<i>wanted to hear your voice.</i>

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:50.679
<i>Okay, then.</i>

01:10:03.992 --> 01:10:05.368
You're warm.

01:10:06.453 --> 01:10:08.788
I wish I could sleep like this.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.666
Go ahead.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.674
What time is it now?

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:22.677
The watch...

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:24.679
No.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:31.770
It's better not to know.

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:43.365
I like this place.
Excellent choice.

01:10:44.241 --> 01:10:46.243
Thank god you like it.

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:47.953
I had so much trouble finding it.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.625
How's Dad doing?

01:10:53.959 --> 01:10:55.377
The same.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.796
Says he feels anxious
after giving up smoking.

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:00.674
He wants to leave New York
because of terrorism.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.842
He hates everywhere.

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:06.805
LA's too boring, and he's scared
of earthquakes in San Francisco.

01:11:06.805 --> 01:11:08.974
What are we going to do
with him?

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:10.433
He could come here.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:11.935
Seoul?

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:13.853
No way, he's scared of the war.

01:11:14.688 --> 01:11:16.439
That's our Dad...

01:11:18.692 --> 01:11:22.612
Hello! So, they wanna change rehearsal schedule.
Push back in an hour. Is that okay?

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:24.864
OK

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:25.699
You need anything?

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:27.367
No. Everything's fine.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:28.618
- Alright.
- Yeah.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:31.538
Are you two serious?

01:11:31.538 --> 01:11:35.041
My relationships are
always serious, every time.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:40.046
But if you mean marriage,
then... not yet.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.549
I don't think
I could live like you.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:45.051
What do you mean,
live like me?

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:47.887
Happily married. Aren't you?

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:58.106
She talks quite a lot
to the kitty.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:01.609
Do they connect in some way?

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:03.903
Curious.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.074
She looks good, right?
Yoo-rim.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.036
You do, too.

01:12:13.121 --> 01:12:16.041
Still, I'm locked up.

01:12:17.876 --> 01:12:20.545
Why do you think so?
Who's locking you up?

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:27.552
You must think
you know me well,

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:31.598
but you don't.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.539
What do you think, Sang-min?

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.959
Good. A little more
glamour wouldn't hurt.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.047
Hun...gry.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.049
You said 'hungry'?

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.802
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:10.053
OK. I'm sorry.

01:13:10.637 --> 01:13:12.722
Sang-min, let's eat first.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.641
Let's resume after lunch.

01:13:21.189 --> 01:13:24.651
- Keep those outfits.
- Yes.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.737
- Put things in order.
- Yes.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.550
How can I help you?

01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:52.137
I'm looking for
Mr. Kim Ki-hong.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:57.058
He's not here now.
What do you need?

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.562
I'm a friend of his.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:03.148
I was just passing by.

01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:06.901
He won't be in today.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:09.988
I see.

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.449
And your name is...?

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:16.161
I'll call him later.

01:14:26.838 --> 01:14:28.047
Excuse me!

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:35.972
Did you happen to know...that he's going through some trouble lately?

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.646
You didn't.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.901
Well...

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:53.156
His wife is very ill.

01:15:01.998 --> 01:15:03.541
Which clothes go with these?

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.834
These ones.

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:10.798
Or something like this with
a similar tone could work.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:12.091
Your phone is ringing.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:14.761
- These are good.
- Really?

01:15:14.761 --> 01:15:17.263
Then we'll change them all.
What about this?

01:15:17.263 --> 01:15:18.973
That one goes with...

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:31.653
Yes.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:33.530
<i>Can you talk?</i>

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.073
Go ahead, please.

01:15:39.911 --> 01:15:41.162
Hello?

01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:45.542
- It's strange.
- What's strange?

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.546
<i>You sound strange.</i>

01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:53.758
<i>And you look worried.</i>

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.067
Come out for a sec.

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.861
<i>I can't, I'm busy.</i>

01:16:15.989 --> 01:16:19.867
<i>You came to see me earlier.</i>

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:36.259
You won't talk to me?

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.026
Let's just have sex.

01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:55.069
What's this about?

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:58.740
You like me, and I like you too.
That's enough.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.408
Why bother talking?

01:17:05.079 --> 01:17:06.372
Sang-min!

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:15.006
I just want to talk to you.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:18.176
What's there to talk about?

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:20.762
Why are you so angry?

01:17:29.437 --> 01:17:31.356
I need a cigarette.

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:34.359
Can you buy some for me?

01:17:43.743 --> 01:17:46.371
I'm not angry at you.

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.749
At myself...

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.752
I'm angry at myself.

01:18:18.945 --> 01:18:21.865
<i>WE SHOULD END IT HERE.
LET'S END WHEN IT'S BEST.</i>

01:19:07.744 --> 01:19:09.036
Let's go, Jong-hwa!

01:19:11.998 --> 01:19:13.124
Hello.

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:14.125
Be careful!

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:16.335
<i>How could you leave like that?</i>

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:25.178
I'm sorry, but please
don't call me again.

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:29.015
<i>If you're really sorry,
tell me in person.</i>

01:19:30.308 --> 01:19:32.185
<i>I can't end it like this.</i>

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:02.381
It's better to end it now,
before it gets too hard.

01:20:06.052 --> 01:20:07.595
Was it nothing to you?

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:14.101
What can we do?
We don't have a choice.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:18.189
<i>INCOMING CALL: LEE HA-JUNG</i>

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.403
Hello, Ha-jung.

01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:26.864
Hi, are you on your way?

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:28.616
What are you talking about?

01:20:29.575 --> 01:20:31.828
I'm waiting for Jong-hwa.

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.121
He went in a while ago.

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:36.457
<i>I've been waiting
here at the entrance.</i>

01:20:38.626 --> 01:20:42.213
Wait...
You haven't met him yet?

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:46.300
No, did you really see him
come in here?

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:47.969
Just before...

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:54.392
I'm sure he went in.

01:20:54.392 --> 01:20:55.935
<i>Where is he then?</i>

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:58.104
<i>Let me look for him.</i>

01:20:58.271 --> 01:21:01.858
I'll go now.
Call me if you find him.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.660
I'm almost there.
Did you find him?

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:15.371
The instructors and I
searched every floor

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.290
but I don't think
he's in the building.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:21.627
Then...what do...

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.047
He could be outside.

01:21:25.214 --> 01:21:27.049
I'll go out and look for him.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.677
Please do that.
I'll look for him on the way.

01:21:57.163 --> 01:21:59.332
Don't worry, he'll be alright.

01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:20.728
Should we go a bit further...?

01:22:37.328 --> 01:22:38.329
Look!

01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:49.715
Jong-hwa!

01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:56.389
Jong-hwa!

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.312
What are you doing here
in the rain?

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.398
Let's go home.
Come with Mommy.

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:08.234
- Drifting away.
- What?

01:23:09.068 --> 01:23:10.653
Drifting away.

01:23:12.571 --> 01:23:14.240
Drifting away.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.247
Give me his shoe.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:29.672
Sang-min!

01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:36.429
I found your shoe!

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.146
My shoe...

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:48.274
My shoe...

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:51.235
- Mommy found it!
- My shoe...

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:52.820
Let's go home now.

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:10.046
Years ago,
while playing by the sea

01:24:10.046 --> 01:24:12.590
his shoe came off and
was swept away by the waves.

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.258
He must've remembered it.

01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:17.762
A memory hard
for a kid to forget...

01:24:21.474 --> 01:24:24.769
You found it for him.
Now he can forget it.

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.774
Some memories are
better when forgotten.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.736
The sea.

01:24:34.487 --> 01:24:35.654
The sea.

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:37.823
Sea...

01:24:38.491 --> 01:24:39.575
The sea...

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:40.868
You want to go to the sea?

01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:43.788
Let's go again sometime.

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:46.874
The sea... sea...

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:48.751
The sea...

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.258
The sea...

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:31.752
Thank you.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:36.590
I'm glad you were with me.

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:48.686
You're not answering?

01:25:59.864 --> 01:26:01.240
You're not answering?

01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:05.369
They can call back.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.756
It seems whenever we meet,
we're traveling.

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:20.593
It's true.

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.346
Shall we not go back?

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:27.600
Sure.

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:35.357
I'm not kidding.

01:26:40.946 --> 01:26:42.990
We really are in trouble.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:55.669
What did you draw?

01:26:55.961 --> 01:26:57.504
- Shoe.
- Hold on, Jong-hwa.

01:26:57.504 --> 01:26:59.673
Why is a shoe in the sea?

01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:02.009
It drifted away.

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:04.970
I see, it drifted away.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:07.473
But whose shoe is it?

01:27:12.353 --> 01:27:15.856
Despite getting so soaked,
he seems to be fine.

01:27:16.232 --> 01:27:17.608
That's a relief.

01:27:17.691 --> 01:27:19.944
Why go to the sea,
all of a sudden?

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:24.031
He wanted to go.

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:27.785
Well clone.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:32.248
Sometimes you need to be impulsive.

01:27:35.334 --> 01:27:38.254
<i>This is heart-shaped.</i>

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:40.631
<i>Right! How many are there?</i>

01:27:41.966 --> 01:27:44.677
One, two, three...

01:27:44.677 --> 01:27:47.805
Dad is home.

01:27:49.265 --> 01:27:50.432
Here you are.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:53.435
Are you clone eating?

01:27:54.019 --> 01:27:56.438
Really? Then I'll take that.

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:58.357
Did you eat?

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:04.613
I made pasta.
You want some?

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.701
Yoo-rim, brush your teeth.

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:14.790
It's a simple one I made
with the things in the fridge.

01:28:27.094 --> 01:28:28.637
You know...

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.935
I like you a lot.

01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:38.939
Maybe too much.

01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:46.113
I needed a man who
loves me as a woman.

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:48.782
I didn't want a guardian.

01:28:50.617 --> 01:28:53.787
But with you
I feel like a patient.

01:28:55.789 --> 01:28:57.041
I know...

01:28:58.334 --> 01:29:00.044
I'm a bit weird.

01:29:02.046 --> 01:29:04.548
And you, staying by my side...

01:29:06.717 --> 01:29:09.553
The thought just came to me.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:13.349
Have I ever understood
my husband?

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.605
It must've been
so hard on him.

01:29:21.607 --> 01:29:23.942
He must've been so lonely.

01:29:56.809 --> 01:29:59.645
Daddy's fine.

01:30:29.675 --> 01:30:31.552
Check if it's correct.
One, two, three, four.

01:30:34.555 --> 01:30:35.722
That's right.

01:30:38.434 --> 01:30:39.977
Much better, right?

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:42.813
Are the earrings too much?

01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:44.565
We'll change it later.

01:30:46.817 --> 01:30:48.735
Is this the right order?
Doesn't it overlap?

01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:52.990
Make a fierce look!

01:30:54.199 --> 01:30:55.534
Good.

01:30:57.035 --> 01:30:59.204
It's me.
Can we talk?

01:31:00.164 --> 01:31:01.457
<i>Yes.</i>

01:31:03.208 --> 01:31:04.877
<i>You must be busy.</i>

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:08.547
Today's the big clay,
so it's been hectic.

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:10.549
How have you been?

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:14.803
Ma'am.
Your sister's looking for you.

01:31:16.263 --> 01:31:18.891
Sorry. I'll call you later.

01:31:21.226 --> 01:31:22.728
<i>I miss you.</i>

01:31:25.272 --> 01:31:27.232
<i>Let's meet after the show.</i>

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:33.697
It'll be quite late.
Is that okay?

01:31:35.073 --> 01:31:36.658
I'll wait.

01:31:59.306 --> 01:32:02.559
Good job, everyone!

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:08.565
Your sister was tired,
so she went back to the hotel.

01:32:08.565 --> 01:32:09.566
I know.

01:32:10.526 --> 01:32:13.737
Her boyfriend is quite cute.

01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:16.907
Though I'm not really into
foreign guys.

01:32:19.326 --> 01:32:21.078
I'm glad the show went well.

01:32:21.245 --> 01:32:24.331
- Aren't you?
- Yeah, me too.

01:32:26.166 --> 01:32:27.751
Take her stuff.

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.090
I'll drive you home.

01:32:33.549 --> 01:32:37.302
- I'll manage, go ahead.
- Alright then.

01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:39.263
Let's

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.266
Take care. Good job today!

01:32:42.266 --> 01:32:44.643
Thank you, good night!

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:56.071
Shall we call mom?

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:01.994
Look, Jong-hwa.
Mommy's over there!

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.836
Jong-hwa...

01:33:11.753 --> 01:33:13.171
Surprised to see us?

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:15.257
The show finished early?

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:20.137
Jong-hwa, if we were any later,
we would have missed her.

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:22.014
What brings you here?

01:33:22.848 --> 01:33:25.183
Jong-hwa's been
missing you all clay.

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:28.854
So we decided to take a drive
and pick you up.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:31.398
You must be tired.

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:35.736
Let's bring Mommy home.

01:33:44.911 --> 01:33:46.204
You're not coming?

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:55.422
Be careful, son.

01:34:08.018 --> 01:34:10.187
So your busy stretch
is over now?

01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:15.067
Jong-hwa, let's take
a trip with mom, shall we?

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:51.478
<i>I'M SO SORRY, TONIGHT I CANT</i>

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:03.448
What?

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:05.492
You're going out?

01:35:06.952 --> 01:35:08.120
Yes.

01:35:08.495 --> 01:35:10.038
Going where?

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:13.500
I need to see someone.

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:16.461
At this hour?

01:35:18.755 --> 01:35:22.467
I see...
It seems you have a lover?

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.848
Yeah.

01:35:37.023 --> 01:35:39.359
I can't live without him.

01:35:43.196 --> 01:35:45.031
You don't have to forgive me.

01:35:45.991 --> 01:35:49.161
Even I can't forgive myself.

01:35:52.164 --> 01:35:53.498
Lee Sang-min.

01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:57.043
Sit down here for a sec.

01:35:57.836 --> 01:36:00.130
Let's talk it through.
What on earth...

01:36:00.130 --> 01:36:02.340
- I'm sorry, really.
- Lee Sang-min!

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:38.914
<i>ONE YEAR LATER</i>

01:38:38.955 --> 01:38:40.957
You want me to come
for no reason?

01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:43.209
<i>Does it have to be for work?</i>

01:38:43.209 --> 01:38:45.670
<i>Just come and have fun.</i>

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:49.966
New York is too cold.
I'll go when it warms up.

01:38:50.216 --> 01:38:52.344
Dad's worried about you.

01:38:52.552 --> 01:38:54.512
<i>Living all alone.</i>

01:38:59.059 --> 01:39:01.937
<i>You've pulled yourself together?</i>

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:07.400
<i>Alright, let's talk again.</i>

01:39:08.068 --> 01:39:09.486
Bye, sis.

01:39:52.696 --> 01:39:56.616
It would catch more light,
if they touched the traverse.

01:39:57.534 --> 01:40:00.537
Yes, but also disrupt the flow of
light in the room.

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:02.372
That's true

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:10.463
Coffee?

01:40:10.463 --> 01:40:12.757
Yeah, let's get some
pulla as well.

01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:31.026
Watch out.

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:35.840
How are you?
How many people?

01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:39.761
Ah.. Where is the toilet?

01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:41.888
Toilet? Just around
the corner over there.

01:41:48.144 --> 01:41:49.312
Give me a bite.

01:43:43.509 --> 01:43:44.677
Hello.

01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:46.846
<i>It's me.</i>

01:43:48.473 --> 01:43:49.641
Yes.

01:43:50.683 --> 01:43:52.936
<i>Hello? Sang-min?</i>

01:43:53.853 --> 01:43:55.355
I'm listening.

01:43:56.522 --> 01:43:59.359
<i>I can't hear you clearly.
Hello?</i>

01:43:59.859 --> 01:44:01.361
<i>Do you hear me well?</i>

01:44:01.361 --> 01:44:03.613
I do. Don't you?

01:44:04.697 --> 01:44:08.368
<i>Hello?
Is she out of country?</i>

01:44:08.826 --> 01:44:12.580
<i>- Hello? You hear me?
- Hello?</i>

01:44:17.835 --> 01:44:19.337
Jae-seok.

01:44:24.259 --> 01:44:25.677
Do you hear me?

01:44:26.970 --> 01:44:28.346
Hello?

01:44:29.472 --> 01:44:31.432
It's better now.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:34.018
How are you?

01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:38.523
Okay.

01:44:38.523 --> 01:44:39.774
<i>Jong-hwa, wait.</i>

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:41.943
<i>I'll put Jong-hwa on.</i>

01:44:41.943 --> 01:44:43.611
<i>Son, it's Mom.</i>

01:44:44.612 --> 01:44:48.449
<i>No interest for
first two months</i>

01:44:48.449 --> 01:44:51.536

01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:09.637
I love you, too.

01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:18.563
I love you.

01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:33.119
I'm sorry... We can...

01:45:42.545 --> 01:45:44.339
We can go now

01:46:47.068 --> 01:46:48.444
Thank you.

01:46:52.198 --> 01:46:53.658
Huh?

01:46:54.992 --> 01:46:56.452
For what?

01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:03.167
Just saying.

01:48:23.498 --> 01:48:24.874
Do you want one?

01:48:25.249 --> 01:48:26.751
Yes, please.

01:48:44.143 --> 01:48:44.977
Thank you.

01:48:58.241 --> 01:48:59.742
What time is it?

01:49:01.327 --> 01:49:03.996
I don't have a watch...
One moment.

01:49:03.996 --> 01:49:06.165
Oh, no. It's OK.

01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:08.167
I don't need to know.

01:49:16.926 --> 01:49:18.970
It's better not to know.
