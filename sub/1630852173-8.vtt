that Coach Dalton
has been having

08:20.333 --> 08:22.585
an inappropriate
sexual relationship

08:22.668 --> 08:23.753
with a player.

08:23.836 --> 08:24.962
- What?

08:25.046 --> 08:27.173
That's crazy. And gross.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.091
- Well, I have to ask.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.760
I mean, do you know
anything about this, or--

08:30.843 --> 08:32.595
- Me?
No.

08:32.678 --> 08:33.971
I can't even imagine it.

08:34.054 --> 08:35.640
Dalton's so old
he's still on Facebook.

08:35.722 --> 08:38.267
- [laughs]
Okay. Well, look.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.269
If you hear anything,
let me know.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.813
Um, obviously we have to take
this very seriously.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.024
- Of course.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.442
I'll think on it,
and let you know

08:46.525 --> 08:49.612
if anything comes to mind.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.072
Um, I assume
you already talked

08:51.155 --> 08:53.157
to Becky?
Not implying anything,

08:53.241 --> 08:55.534
but I did see them share
a power bar once.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.870
- You are not the first person
to mention that.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.121
Huh. All right, well,

08:59.205 --> 09:00.915
that's very helpful.
Thank you.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.794

09:26.440 --> 09:27.858

I thought it was Jena.

- Did you find out

13:06.702 --> 13:07.953

called her

in his car.
