Cotton Candy did not plagiarize...

00:54.650 --> 01:00.260
"We Rise" is Cotton Candy's song.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.590
What do you mean you can't reach Ji-han?

01:03.590 --> 01:05.060
We had practice this morning, but he didn't come.

01:05.060 --> 01:07.060
He's not picking up. He isn't in his studio.

01:07.060 --> 01:09.830
He's not at home. He won't answer my texts.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.000
Director Yoon.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.940
Did you say anything to Ji-han?

01:13.940 --> 01:14.800
No.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.070
I didn't even see him.

01:17.670 --> 01:20.740
Is there a place or person he goes to?

01:20.740 --> 01:23.810
There's no one close to him in Korea.

01:23.810 --> 01:26.220
He's usually at home, studio or the agency.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.050
So there's no other place.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.620

One Day

01:41.630 --> 01:44.370
"We Rise" is Cotton Candy's song.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.570
Our new song

01:46.570 --> 01:49.509
is an original song that I wrote myself.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.310
Long before Mars' unit started on their song,

01:52.310 --> 01:53.479
I wrote it.

01:53.479 --> 01:57.350
Cotton Candy refuted the plagiarism charges.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.910
Because of a recent article,

01:58.910 --> 02:00.950
Cotton Candy was accused of plagiarizing

02:00.950 --> 02:03.220
Mars's unit's new song "To You"

02:03.220 --> 02:05.790
in their new song.

02:05.790 --> 02:07.960
At this, Cotton Candy released a statement

02:07.960 --> 02:09.759
this morning through their own YouTube channel,

02:09.759 --> 02:12.560
saying, "Cotton Candy's new song that's under

02:12.560 --> 02:15.830
controversy is an original song written by Jenna.

02:15.830 --> 02:19.030
It was made a lot earlier than the day

02:19.030 --> 02:21.600
Mars' unit started working on their song."

02:22.440 --> 02:24.070
This was their claim.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.180
Cotton Candy's leader Jenna

02:27.180 --> 02:29.680
did an interview with News Top Seven,

02:30.350 --> 02:32.910
saying she moved up the release date after

02:32.910 --> 02:35.079
becoming aware of the issue with Mars' unit.

02:35.079 --> 02:37.950
This was so they'd be evaluated by the public

02:38.050 --> 02:40.120
without prejudice or bias.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.520
They stated that their fans will be able to feel

02:41.520 --> 02:44.930
the creative originality contained in their song,

02:44.930 --> 02:48.329
and their fans will become their witnesses,

02:48.329 --> 02:51.230
implying they'll face this head-on.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.240
What's all this?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.270
Is Ji-han okay?

02:58.270 --> 03:00.410
If he was, would he have gone off the grid?

03:00.410 --> 03:03.210
Shouldn't the agency be defending us?

03:03.210 --> 03:05.310
This will get complicated.

03:05.880 --> 03:06.850
Yul.

03:06.850 --> 03:07.580
Huh?

03:07.580 --> 03:09.620
The two songs being similar...

03:10.690 --> 03:11.320
Is that really a coincidence?

03:11.320 --> 03:12.290
Of course.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.160
There's no way Cotton Candy plagiarized.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.320
Unless they're fools.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.590
Sir,

03:17.090 --> 03:19.760
is there another situation we don't know?

03:19.900 --> 03:20.730
What?

03:20.730 --> 03:23.800
CEO Cha asked if you said something to Ji-han...

03:24.329 --> 03:26.540
No. There's no other situation.

03:27.970 --> 03:30.440
Where in the world is Ji-han?

03:31.140 --> 03:33.210
I hope nothing happened to him.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.140
He'll be okay.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.950
A scratch on my face is just an injury.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.920
But a scratch on this artwork...

03:48.520 --> 03:50.990
You think you'll die or not?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.970
You only see yourself.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.470
You think being dignified and just is enough?

04:03.470 --> 04:05.610
You think the world is that simple?

04:07.410 --> 04:09.610
Have you not grown up yet

04:09.910 --> 04:11.510
or are you just refusing to?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.990
You think a scratch won't kill you?

04:16.990 --> 04:18.320
That's true.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.820
Losers can say that.

04:21.390 --> 04:24.260
But you're not losers.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.530
You're a god.

04:27.530 --> 04:30.570
And you said a lot of good things in the past.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.940
I'm not saying you're hypocritical.

04:34.570 --> 04:35.740
I'm saying

04:36.240 --> 04:37.470
there are people

04:37.470 --> 04:40.380
who desperately want you

04:41.340 --> 04:42.640
to be hypocritical.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.210
Why?

04:44.210 --> 04:45.409
Because then

04:46.350 --> 04:49.020
their jealous minds will find peace.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.590
Or they're people who think

04:51.590 --> 04:53.220
it's unfair that they worked harder

04:53.220 --> 04:55.690
but you're more successful.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.190
You didn't even take the college entrance exam.

05:00.630 --> 05:02.760
What do you think will happen if you throw them

05:02.760 --> 05:05.500
a scratch where they can sink their teeth into?

05:05.500 --> 05:08.470
They'll rush at you like brain dead zombies,

05:08.900 --> 05:11.110
and shred you into pieces.

05:11.410 --> 05:11.970
Why?

05:11.970 --> 05:14.640
Because that's their version of justice.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.010
So it's a scratch that can heal with ointment,

05:19.010 --> 05:21.420
but they'll pull it open, take out your intestines,

05:21.420 --> 05:23.550
slice them up and hang them in the market.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.290
Know what's even funnier?

05:25.490 --> 05:26.960
When you get to that point,

05:27.790 --> 05:29.590
even the people who were on your side

05:29.590 --> 05:31.660
will accept that as the truth.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.100
Why?

05:35.330 --> 05:36.530
Because it's tiresome.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.640
It's someone else's business.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.470
You're crazy.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.470
Okay.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.640
Let's say you give up your intestines

05:49.810 --> 05:51.810
to get your justice.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.580
Will it end there?

05:57.590 --> 06:01.160
Are you separate from Mars?

06:02.290 --> 06:04.490
You can at least achieve self-fulfillment.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.830
But what about the others?

06:08.400 --> 06:09.260
Okay.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.870
So Ray is from a rich family.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.370
He can continue to suck his family dry.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.800
But what about Tae-young?

06:15.870 --> 06:17.210
And Yul?

06:18.110 --> 06:20.340
You know better than me how they

06:20.510 --> 06:22.240
made it all the way here.

06:22.440 --> 06:25.610
How long did they suffer as trainees?

06:25.610 --> 06:28.880
How long did they snoop around trashy auditions?

06:29.850 --> 06:30.750
What about Dan?

06:30.750 --> 06:32.690
He just started.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.520
They're now getting their reward.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.590
How dare you disgrace them?

06:38.790 --> 06:39.860
Also...

06:45.700 --> 06:47.270
Who got you this far?

06:49.270 --> 06:50.409
Huh?

06:54.310 --> 06:56.080
You ungrateful bastard.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:20.540 --> 07:21.840
- Take a look.
- What the?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.740
You're late.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.840
Kim Jenna!

07:24.840 --> 07:25.770
Kim Jenna!

07:25.770 --> 07:27.240
Let us in just once.

07:27.240 --> 07:27.840
Hey!

07:27.840 --> 07:28.940
Come out!

07:29.740 --> 07:31.650
Someone's coming out!

07:32.210 --> 07:32.780
Sir!

07:32.780 --> 07:34.150
Who received the food?

07:34.150 --> 07:35.820
A woman? How many people are in there?

07:35.820 --> 07:37.150
What are they doing? How's the vibe?

07:37.150 --> 07:38.750
Is there an air of regret?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.760
I don't know. It's dangerous.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.890
Did you tell them what we said?

07:41.890 --> 07:42.960
What did they say? Will they come out?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.090
I don't know! Move!

07:45.090 --> 07:46.960
Oh, come on!

07:46.960 --> 07:50.430
Sir! What food did you deliver?

07:50.930 --> 07:52.670
Gimbap, tteokbokki, sundae!

07:54.270 --> 07:55.540
Take-out food was just delivered.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.940
It's gimbap, tteokbokki, sundae.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.240
Are you sure?

07:58.240 --> 07:59.840
Someone said jjamppong and jajangmyeon.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.940
They have the audacity to be hungry?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.110
How can they eat?

08:03.110 --> 08:04.950
I don't think they're regretting what they did.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.950
Looks like the interview request was rejected.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.650
We don't see any staff from Starpeace.

08:09.650 --> 08:11.050
Looks like they cut them off.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.890
Kim Jenna's interview is hilarious.

08:12.890 --> 08:15.560
They don't have fans. How can they be witnesses?

08:26.470 --> 08:28.140
Why? Is it brutal?

08:28.140 --> 08:29.140
Huh?

08:30.240 --> 08:31.170
Yeah.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.820
They know what we're eating.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.130
Let me see.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.700
Seriously. They want to talk. Should I go out?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.200
Stop it.

09:00.470 --> 09:02.970
Seok-chun! Come eat!

09:03.610 --> 09:06.340
Troy booked the vocalist studio at night,

09:06.940 --> 09:09.240
thinking they won't be here then.

09:09.240 --> 09:09.940
What about the mixing?

09:09.940 --> 09:12.450
He's adjusting the time with the mixing director.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.950
There's difficulty because we just squeezed in.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.320
But he's the best mixing director in Korea.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.720
We're not in a situation to be picky.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.090
Troy said he'll do it and asked us to trust him.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.760
I envy Mars.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.100
So many people are on their side.

09:28.730 --> 09:29.900
Seok-chun.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.670
Yes?

09:30.670 --> 09:32.370
The tenant down stairs will guard the entrance.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.070
There's no telling how they'll sneak in.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.130
But it's strange.

09:37.740 --> 09:40.040
Why hasn't the agency stated their position?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.080
Yes, Sir.

09:51.320 --> 09:54.620
I must talk to you in person, but I can't get in.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.060
You want me to send some bodyguards?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.730
No.

10:03.230 --> 10:05.030
We're doing well by ourselves.

10:05.030 --> 10:06.030
Well?

10:07.170 --> 10:10.370
So you interviewed without discussing it first?

10:10.370 --> 10:13.110
To my knowledge, I discussed it with you.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.540
The situation has become complicated.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.050
It's become simpler for us.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.110
Kim Jenna.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.920
I think I might believe you.

10:24.020 --> 10:27.660
Then now, we'll be enemies.

10:29.090 --> 10:30.860
Ji-han can't be reached.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.330
Did something happen?

10:32.330 --> 10:34.000
I don't think so.

10:34.630 --> 10:36.500
I have to meet Ji-han first

10:36.870 --> 10:38.930
to decide whether I'll be

10:39.100 --> 10:40.570
a friend or foe.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.010
I'm sorry I can't fully be on your side.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.010
But,

10:47.780 --> 10:49.380
compared to you,

10:50.350 --> 10:52.410
I have a lot more regrets concerning Ji-han.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.620
From now on, I'm not going to do

10:56.220 --> 10:57.820
anything that might make him suffer.

10:59.520 --> 11:00.490
Sir.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.760
We're fine.

11:05.230 --> 11:07.660
When you told us to give up the song up,

11:07.660 --> 11:09.630
you passed the ball to us.

11:10.970 --> 11:14.140
Whether I pass it back or keep it, it was on us.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.140
So I passed the ball. It's the agency's turn.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.380
Pass it back or keep it. Do whatever you want.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.110
Except,

11:23.580 --> 11:25.780
I hope your stance

11:26.110 --> 11:29.180
isn't to pass the ball to Ji-han.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.150
That will be cowardly.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.500
I'm sorry.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.140
we're closed.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.350
Director Yoon!

12:05.820 --> 12:07.560
What is the agency doing?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.820
Cotton Candy

12:08.820 --> 12:11.590
is going around saying nonsense.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.790
Why are you not responding?

12:13.390 --> 12:14.100
Hey...

12:14.100 --> 12:17.330
Does Executive Bong know that you know?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.830
Since he hasn't said anything,

12:19.940 --> 12:21.400
I think he doesn't know.

12:21.400 --> 12:25.340
Then don't tell him anything until I talk to him.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.240
There will be a response soon.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.480
Are you going to let them take our song?

12:30.480 --> 12:31.680
Hey, Bbiyong...

12:32.250 --> 12:34.550
What's CEO Cha doing? Where is he?

12:34.550 --> 12:35.920
I'm here.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.460
Search for Ji-han quickly.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.960
Come in.

12:54.370 --> 12:56.670
Can't you see they're manipulating the media?

12:56.670 --> 12:59.940
If things go wrong, they'd say I copied theirs!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.480
Don't you know how the media works?

13:02.680 --> 13:04.880
They go to the side that'll make them money.

13:04.880 --> 13:08.280
Mars and Cotton, which side will make money?

13:08.450 --> 13:11.150
What if word goes around even carelessly

13:11.150 --> 13:12.820
that Mars plagiarized? Why are you dawdling?

13:12.820 --> 13:14.160
You mean you.

13:15.320 --> 13:15.660
What?

13:15.660 --> 13:17.430
If we do get charged of plagiarism,

13:17.890 --> 13:20.060
it's your fault since you're the songwriter.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.130
That's nonsense.

13:25.670 --> 13:28.470
People won't differentiate.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.640
Since Mars' name is on it, Mars did it!

13:30.640 --> 13:33.980
I'm capable enough to help people differentiate.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.150
Anyway,

13:41.950 --> 13:44.020
don't just look on this situation.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.720
If you keep doing that,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.820
people will think you and Jenna are dating.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.990
Don't cross the line, Executive Bong.

13:58.430 --> 14:00.500
I should listen to what the unit team has to say.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.040
They're directly involved.

14:05.610 --> 14:08.310
You're very democratic, hmm?

14:08.480 --> 14:10.040
Is that the American style?

14:10.550 --> 14:11.780
But, Sir.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.550
Our boys

14:13.850 --> 14:16.420
have never lifted a spoon themselves to eat.

14:16.420 --> 14:17.820
The agency should solve the problem.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.820
That's why you exist.

14:19.820 --> 14:20.990
If you're done, you can leave.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.520
Oh, and Ji-han

14:23.260 --> 14:24.890
already finished talking with me.

14:24.890 --> 14:26.260
Did you meet Ji-han?

14:28.290 --> 14:31.270
He came to me yesterday.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.170
In any situation,

14:33.400 --> 14:37.170
Ji-han puts his team and fans first.

14:37.170 --> 14:39.670
He did that in the past, he does it now,

14:40.480 --> 14:41.610
and he'll keep doing that.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.450
So...

14:49.420 --> 14:51.190
Help me not cross the line.

15:13.310 --> 15:15.080
CEO Ma Jin-woo

15:15.080 --> 15:17.610
CEO Ma Jin-woo

15:22.850 --> 15:26.690

15:27.320 --> 15:28.660
Delete

15:29.060 --> 15:31.090
Will you delete this email?
Delete

15:37.200 --> 15:38.730
Title: Jenna's song / Sent by: CEO Ma Jin-woo /
Sent to: Executive Bong Chung Bong / CC: Starpeace Yoon Se-yeol.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.290
Reporter Choi.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.590
Director Yoon!

15:59.290 --> 16:00.590
Did you get in touch with Ji-han?

16:00.590 --> 16:01.860
No, we're looking for him...

16:01.860 --> 16:03.190
Find him quickly!

16:03.690 --> 16:05.390
Offer a reward or report a missing person!

16:05.390 --> 16:06.430
Got that?

16:08.660 --> 16:10.130
Aunt, I'm busy...

16:52.570 --> 16:54.370
Ji-han expresses agony regarding
the plagiarism of Mars' unit's new song "To You"

16:53.340 --> 16:54.540
What's this?

16:54.880 --> 16:57.550
Ji-han expresses agony...

16:58.110 --> 17:00.450
I don't know for sure if Cotton Candy

17:00.450 --> 17:02.080
plagiarized our song.

17:02.110 --> 17:06.520
But their stance this morning was disappointing.

17:07.119 --> 17:10.859
I feel betrayed because I helped their comeback.

17:10.859 --> 17:12.930
I never thought Mars would get caught up

17:12.930 --> 17:15.460
in this kind of problem, so I'm disconcerted.

17:15.460 --> 17:16.900
There are no other options.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.369
I'll trust my team and fans

17:18.369 --> 17:20.940
and continue to walk on steadfastly.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.099
What's with the rooster?

17:23.099 --> 17:24.339
Did Seo Ji-han say that?

17:24.339 --> 17:25.339
Yes!

17:25.510 --> 17:28.480
He just spoke his thoughts to an agency staff.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.910
Wow, that kind of media manipulation is low.

17:30.910 --> 17:33.210
This isn't even an official interview.

17:33.210 --> 17:34.950
Isn't this a private conversation?

17:35.320 --> 17:37.220
How can he leak this?

17:38.150 --> 17:41.020
I guess CEO Cha's stance is clear now.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.590
He'll make an official statement soon.

17:43.490 --> 17:44.930
It's all knives out.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.330
"We Rise" is Cotton Candy's song

17:45.890 --> 17:47.530
How can you betray good will?

17:47.530 --> 17:49.100
How dare you lie?

17:49.100 --> 17:50.780
Shut down your channel!

17:50.970 --> 17:53.000
How dare you mess with Mars!

17:53.200 --> 17:54.670
A failed idol did a failed thing.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.400
How dare they claim it's their song!

17:56.400 --> 17:58.410
Crazy, Copy Candy!

17:58.410 --> 18:00.510
I knew this would happen.

17:59.140 --> 18:00.840
Crazy, Copy Candy!

18:00.580 --> 18:01.980
Why would he manipulate the media like that?

18:00.840 --> 18:01.940
Why would Mars copy a failed idol's song?

18:01.940 --> 18:03.010
Expel Cotton Candy!

18:01.980 --> 18:03.210
He gave them a way in.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.010
Get lost, Cotton Candy!

18:03.210 --> 18:05.450
Why do they all say we plagiarized?

18:05.810 --> 18:07.450
Don't they know it's ridiculous?

18:08.020 --> 18:11.420
If we did, why'd we send it to Bbiyong?

18:11.490 --> 18:13.050
It's not that they don't know.

18:13.050 --> 18:16.360
They're doing this because it has to be us.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.860
If Ji-han said something, things will clear up.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.360
This isn't something we didn't expect.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.030
Like Troy said, let's just go our way.

18:24.030 --> 18:24.800
Huh?

18:25.300 --> 18:27.030
Troy's interview has been uploaded!

18:28.240 --> 18:30.640
"We Rise" is Cotton Candy's song.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.940
I knew it the moment I heard the melody.

18:32.940 --> 18:36.740
There was a time Cotton Candy and I shared dreams.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.850
Since we knew each other's strengths and faults,

18:38.850 --> 18:40.280
the outline for how to arrange it

18:40.280 --> 18:42.850
and how to produce it

18:42.850 --> 18:44.750
was drawn up instantly.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.660
Please don't confine this chaos to plagiarism

18:47.660 --> 18:49.590
and evaluate the songs as they are.

18:49.590 --> 18:53.060
There is evidence that Jenna wrote the song first.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.100
But I don't want to counterattack with that.

18:55.100 --> 18:57.470
Because it goes against my morals

18:57.470 --> 18:59.670
to rashly accuse a colleague of plagiarism

18:59.670 --> 19:01.970
who I've collaborated with in the past.

19:02.870 --> 19:05.770
Wow, he's so dignified.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.840
Is this subtle bashing?

19:09.740 --> 19:11.810
He was dignified,

19:11.810 --> 19:13.850
but he poured oil on the flame.

19:13.850 --> 19:17.590
Are you saying Ji-han isn't moral?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.520
You're producing for a failed idol group.

19:20.350 --> 19:21.520
Why you...

19:23.320 --> 19:25.790
Where are all our fans?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.260
Seriously!

19:31.950 --> 19:33.170
Cotton Candy Official Fan Website
We're looking for the 26 Candies

19:35.970 --> 19:36.840
Where are they?

19:36.840 --> 19:38.940
Where are you? Why aren't you here?

19:55.790 --> 19:57.690
Chae-ah, what is it?

19:58.590 --> 20:00.530
What's wrong? Is it bad?

20:01.800 --> 20:02.800
What is it?

20:05.370 --> 20:06.330
Huh?

20:16.210 --> 20:17.380
It's Mrs. Homma.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.510
It's Mom!

20:19.550 --> 20:20.510
I mean...

20:22.280 --> 20:23.520
It's Mom...

20:25.750 --> 20:26.790
They're here.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.030
They've come.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.690
They're back!

20:47.880 --> 20:48.980
It's Mom!

20:49.380 --> 20:51.610
I have a nitwit of a son studying for college.

20:51.610 --> 20:53.810
I've been fighting with him day and night,

20:53.810 --> 20:55.850
so I've kept silent,

20:55.850 --> 20:58.990
but I can't stay silent any longer.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.320
How dare they mess with my babies!

21:00.320 --> 21:01.680
They're all dead!

21:01.820 --> 21:03.790
We're Candies that never cry!

21:03.790 --> 21:05.430
They'll have to deal with us!

21:09.730 --> 21:12.230
She hasn't changed.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.530
I'm here, too.

21:13.530 --> 21:14.540
Me, too!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.340
Here!

21:15.340 --> 21:16.340
I've become a fan again!

21:16.340 --> 21:20.010
I made my sisters and friend fans of Cotton.

21:20.010 --> 21:21.210
Sorry I'm late.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.080
I needed someone to take the lead.

21:23.080 --> 21:24.310
I'm such a coward.

21:24.410 --> 21:28.680
I made all of my husband's family fans of Cotton.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.050
I made all of my wife's family fans of Cotton,

21:32.050 --> 21:35.260
even my brother-in-law's son's daycare teacher.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.160
I'm so proud of you, Cotton Candy!

21:37.630 --> 21:40.330
We missed you. We've been waiting for you.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.400
Hyun-ji's still so spirited.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.970
My Cotton Candy has gotten prettier.

21:45.430 --> 21:48.000
My babies! Fight on!

21:48.970 --> 21:51.040
Let's go! Let's fight! Let's win!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.410
I'm going to see my singers become No.1.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.150
I don't believe this.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.150
They're amazing.

22:11.390 --> 22:12.530
You're here.

22:13.060 --> 22:14.360
He's not there.

22:14.930 --> 22:15.860
What?

22:16.030 --> 22:18.030
I applied acupuncture.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.800
He slept for a bit. Now he's on the roof.

22:42.290 --> 22:43.760
Why did you do that then?

22:45.490 --> 22:47.360
I keep thinking about that time.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.800
Why did you hate them getting married?

22:53.800 --> 22:55.900
No matter how hard I try, I can't understand it.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.040
At first,

22:59.740 --> 23:01.180
I thought

23:02.440 --> 23:05.150
there was something wrong with your dad.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.210
'Is that why he's so against it?'

23:09.680 --> 23:11.620
I thought that.

23:14.590 --> 23:16.190
But I realized when we met again a few years later

23:16.190 --> 23:17.220
at Triple Entertainment.

23:17.960 --> 23:18.960
Oh.

23:21.430 --> 23:23.700
You just really don't like me.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.930
So much so that you want to ruin my future.

23:33.970 --> 23:36.410
Why didn't you say that in the first place?

23:38.810 --> 23:40.850
You said we're like family.

23:42.950 --> 23:44.550
You said that first.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.500
When I got beat up by kids in the States,

23:55.830 --> 23:57.930
you learned taekwondo.

23:59.630 --> 24:02.530
You said I was a baby and carried me around.

24:03.170 --> 24:05.440
You taught me English.

24:05.670 --> 24:08.380
You taught me how to count.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.050
You taught me how to use chopsticks

24:11.050 --> 24:13.110
and how to play the guitar.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.920
You were the one who said I had musical talent.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.790
We were lonely since we were both an only child.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.600
You're the one who said we should be brothers.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
Why did you reject us being a real family?

24:37.470 --> 24:38.940
Why?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.670
Why?

24:40.670 --> 24:42.340
Everyone wanted it.

24:44.450 --> 24:47.010
Was there something going on you couldn't say?

24:48.280 --> 24:51.550
Was your dad a psycho serial killer?

25:00.030 --> 25:01.500
I didn't have the courage.

25:02.100 --> 25:02.900
What?

25:03.030 --> 25:03.870
Being a family

25:03.890 --> 25:05.890
and being like a family are different.

25:07.570 --> 25:10.070
If we really became a family,

25:11.740 --> 25:13.530
I felt that I'd be trapped

25:13.550 --> 25:15.550
in the identity of being Korean.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.540
What?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.180
That was it?

25:24.620 --> 25:26.650
That was everything to me then.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.520
You weren't the only one

25:28.540 --> 25:30.160
who was racially discriminated.

25:30.520 --> 25:31.860
You weren't the only one

25:31.860 --> 25:34.190
who suffered unfairness or felt anger and fear.

25:35.460 --> 25:37.060
Was that level of thinking possible

25:37.060 --> 25:39.470
because you were so smart?

25:39.970 --> 25:42.140
How old were you back then?

25:43.240 --> 25:45.170
About your age now.

25:45.470 --> 25:46.750
This is disappointing.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.780
You needed courage to become a family?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.380
I agree it sounds ridiculous.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.500
Are you saying

25:55.250 --> 25:56.620
you regret it?

25:57.850 --> 25:59.320
The great Cha Jae-hyuk has regrets?

26:05.560 --> 26:07.030
Starpeace...

26:08.500 --> 26:10.000
I came here because of you.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.170
What?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.600
Are you trying to be my brother now?

26:17.270 --> 26:19.170
Because of your dad's will?

26:24.380 --> 26:25.750
What did Bbiyong say?

26:27.850 --> 26:29.150
Did he threaten you?

26:29.620 --> 26:30.950
What are you talking about?

26:32.420 --> 26:34.660
If he did, that means he confessed as well.

26:34.920 --> 26:35.960
So?

26:37.390 --> 26:39.630
Did he say Mars will get hurt if you come clean?

26:42.130 --> 26:43.630
He's not wrong.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.400
Even if Bbiyong did this by himself,

26:46.500 --> 26:47.840
not only you,

26:48.540 --> 26:51.270
but also Mars will suffer a huge blow.

26:53.940 --> 26:57.240
I'll also get beaten up by the board.

26:59.450 --> 27:00.980
How did you know?

27:02.580 --> 27:03.620
I mean...

27:06.450 --> 27:07.960
What do I have to do?

27:08.220 --> 27:09.720
What do you want to do?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.400
Do what you want.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.790
Make a decision,

27:16.930 --> 27:19.330
and then tell me if it's go or stop.

27:19.970 --> 27:22.300
Leave the rest to me.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
Ji-han.

27:30.610 --> 27:32.810
You protect what's most important to you.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.950
I'll protect what's most important to me.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.550
What's most important to me

27:44.530 --> 27:46.560
is you not getting hurt again.

27:49.660 --> 27:50.930
One more thing.

27:51.870 --> 27:53.400
Your career right now.

27:55.070 --> 27:56.740
It didn't just happen.

28:01.740 --> 28:04.040
These are TV shows we can appear on

28:04.040 --> 28:05.280
- when our song comes out.
- Okay.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.380
Go to the producers and say hello.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.180
Okay.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.250
I've marked the shows that asked us to appear.

28:10.250 --> 28:10.990
Alright.

28:10.990 --> 28:13.250
These are reporters who are friendly toward us.

28:13.450 --> 28:15.690
We have interviews tomorrow and the day after.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.220
Put it in your schedule and save their numbers.

28:18.220 --> 28:19.830
Okay, I got it.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.500
But Jenna.

28:21.830 --> 28:24.400
Will the producers meet me?

28:25.470 --> 28:27.630
We're gossip material so they'll meet you.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.140
But after that,

28:29.600 --> 28:30.740
it's up to you.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.540
Okay.

28:31.540 --> 28:32.770
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.380
Don't wear clothes with holes in them.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.310
Okay.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.280
Where are they fighting?

28:39.450 --> 28:41.580
They destroyed the enemy's headquarters.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.020
Now they're fighting in an idol community website.

28:44.020 --> 28:48.520
Our Candies have insane combat power.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.600
I reported the Callas who cursed
Why are you criticizing without fact checking?

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
You believe that crap? Are you a Candy?
I am! You still believe everything at face value?

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
Bring it on! I'll knock down anyone messing with Cotton Candy!

28:47.600 --> 28:48.500
We're fully charged! Calla or Curry, bring it on!

28:48.520 --> 28:49.690
A match for a hundred.

28:49.690 --> 28:51.730
I knew it.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.600
Get a sense of what's going on!

28:59.600 --> 29:01.400
You believe that crap? Are you a Candy?

29:19.750 --> 29:20.750
Hyun-ji.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.790
During the break, how about we switch places?

29:24.490 --> 29:26.760
The way going back is smoother on your side.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.100
By the way,

29:34.170 --> 29:36.340
what is Stella doing in her room for so long?

29:46.280 --> 29:48.180
Writer Seong! Hello!

29:48.180 --> 29:49.380
Jenna!

29:50.050 --> 29:51.050
Lia Kim is

29:51.290 --> 29:52.650
coming to your house

29:52.650 --> 29:53.490
What?

29:54.560 --> 29:55.920
I think it's Lia Kim.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.220
Oh, my gosh!

29:57.220 --> 29:59.130
I think it really is Lia Kim.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.430
No way. Why would Lia Kim be here?

30:00.430 --> 30:02.130
- It's her!
- Wow! Awesome!

30:01.660 --> 30:03.160
Lia Kim / Leading Korean female choreographer
CEO of One Million Dance Studio

30:02.130 --> 30:02.760
It's really her!

30:02.760 --> 30:04.000
It's Lia Kim!

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Lia!

30:15.510 --> 30:16.780
Lia Kim...

30:17.380 --> 30:18.850
Is my idol.

30:19.610 --> 30:20.980
Nice to meet you.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.750
She wants to do the choreography for Cotton Candy.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.190
Oh, for free.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.220
We watched the ruckus all day.

30:30.220 --> 30:32.130
We thought this was going too far.

30:32.630 --> 30:35.630
Ever since you said you'll be No.1 then disband,

30:35.630 --> 30:37.900
I've been watching you with interest.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.360
We also started in a basement studio.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.640
I really wanted to meet you.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.910
I think this is the right time.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.040
I quit my radio job.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.110
I couldn't take that guy's hysteria anymore.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.710
You know my name is Seong Ji-hye, right?

30:52.910 --> 30:53.510
Yes.

30:53.510 --> 30:56.180
He knows, but he keeps calling me Writer Jeong.

30:56.180 --> 30:57.580
That moron.

30:57.650 --> 31:00.550
What's wrong about being a Cotton Candy fan?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.820
So I'm going to donate my talents.

31:03.090 --> 31:04.390
Leave the publicity to me.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.060
I have a team, too.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.990
We got together while fangirling over soap operas,

31:07.990 --> 31:09.360
but we're all professionals.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.100
We have a consulting company CEO.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.200
A designer.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.700
An advertising company planner.

31:13.700 --> 31:14.940
And a translator.

31:15.670 --> 31:18.570
Lia and I met on a show as a cast and writer.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.010
Thank you.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.510
This isn't a dream, is it?

31:24.710 --> 31:26.050
Pinch me.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.350
This is real! It's real!

31:30.350 --> 31:31.720
Oh, my gosh!

31:33.590 --> 31:35.020
Whoa...

31:36.120 --> 31:37.290
Since I'm here,

31:37.290 --> 31:38.560
I'll take a look at the choreography.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.560
Do you have choreography notes?

31:40.560 --> 31:41.700
Oh, yes, of course.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.630
Oh! It's here, here.

31:43.630 --> 31:44.700
Wait.

31:45.970 --> 31:48.270
Here. Right here.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.040
Seo Ji-han

31:48.940 --> 31:50.270
My hands are shaking.

31:53.970 --> 31:56.880
You even have the formation. Wow.

31:56.880 --> 31:57.880
Hello?

31:58.010 --> 31:59.150
I'm in front of your house.

31:59.910 --> 32:00.550
Can you come out?

32:00.550 --> 32:01.920
Are you crazy?

32:01.920 --> 32:03.520
I'm in the public parking lot.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.390
I'm at the end.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.740
I read an article about your interview.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.570
I read an article about you, too.

32:25.270 --> 32:26.710
I didn't say those words.

32:28.610 --> 32:29.910
It doesn't matter.

32:30.940 --> 32:32.710
We're going as planned.

32:34.580 --> 32:35.680
I told you

32:36.780 --> 32:39.890
I fell in love with our title song, right?

32:41.120 --> 32:42.760
Just like you said,

32:44.990 --> 32:46.590
we're in a love triangle.

32:47.330 --> 32:50.800
Regardless of you saying it's your song,

32:52.500 --> 32:54.230
I still love my song.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.240
I was happy, working on it.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.610
Just like when I first learned music,

33:08.050 --> 33:10.550
it felt like it woke up everything inside me.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.750
People might ask

33:13.690 --> 33:16.620
why we're making a fuss about one song.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.260
But people like us know.

33:21.090 --> 33:23.060
What it's like to encounter

33:24.330 --> 33:27.170
a hidden spring after wandering a winter forest.

33:29.740 --> 33:30.900
Even if

33:33.510 --> 33:35.050
it's someone else's garden.

33:40.650 --> 33:42.980
What I made there after? It's all mine.

33:44.620 --> 33:46.720
They're my own senses.

33:49.190 --> 33:50.490
I hope you know that.

33:51.020 --> 33:52.230
Seo Ji-han...

33:53.390 --> 33:54.660
Good luck.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.090
Hey!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.100
What happened?

34:31.100 --> 34:32.230
Where were you?

34:32.230 --> 34:33.969
Do you know how much I worried?

34:34.370 --> 34:36.500
If you're going to just take off, erase my number.

34:36.500 --> 34:37.500
I'm sorry.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.070
I had something to think about.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.139
The article...

34:44.639 --> 34:46.050
Do you really mean it?

34:47.409 --> 34:48.620
It's strange.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.120
The method wasn't like you.

34:50.580 --> 34:51.690
Who's the agency staff?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.489
Director Yoon? CEO Cha?

34:54.320 --> 34:55.719
Is it Bbiyong?

34:56.420 --> 34:57.020
I think so.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.530
Why isn't the agency straightening this up?

34:58.530 --> 34:59.330
Ray.

35:03.360 --> 35:04.460
Ji-han,

35:05.470 --> 35:06.500
I think Bbiyong...

35:06.500 --> 35:07.970
Can you call the team together?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.200
I have something to say.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.210
First, I have to talk to you.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.550
Among the groups preparing for a comeback,

35:20.550 --> 35:22.550
KillA is the most threatening.

35:22.550 --> 35:24.580
They started their promotion first,

35:24.580 --> 35:25.690
so if we're not careful,

35:25.690 --> 35:27.890
it'll look like we're imitating them.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.660
We should sort things out today,

35:30.660 --> 35:32.360
and focus on preparing for the first week.

35:32.360 --> 35:34.900
And Executive Kim called.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.860
He wanted a meeting with you,

35:37.430 --> 35:38.030
Seo Ji-han

35:37.860 --> 35:39.270
but I held it off for now.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.900
Did you make up your mind?

35:44.440 --> 35:46.340
Okay.

35:47.670 --> 35:49.240
Leave the rest to me.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.140
Focus on preparing your showcase now.

35:52.180 --> 35:53.380
Let's announce an official statement.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.450
Tell Asst. Manager Park to prepare for a meeting.

35:57.420 --> 35:57.940
Sir,

35:57.960 --> 35:59.960
Ji-han says he's holding a press conference...

36:00.650 --> 36:01.720
Press conference?

36:01.720 --> 36:02.890
What press conference?

36:03.260 --> 36:04.290
Hey, Ji-han!

36:04.290 --> 36:05.990
You don't have to do it yourself...

36:12.400 --> 36:13.570
Is that the best?

36:20.810 --> 36:22.610
It'll be in the conference room.

36:23.410 --> 36:24.510
But,

36:24.710 --> 36:26.310
can the CEO do this?

36:26.680 --> 36:28.180
Why can't he take care of this?

36:28.180 --> 36:29.880
Why make Ji-han do it?

36:30.380 --> 36:31.380
This is why

36:32.120 --> 36:34.520
I told him to sort things out before it got worse.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.860
What about Ji-han?

36:36.660 --> 36:37.820
He's in the lounge.

36:38.590 --> 36:40.160
The lounge?

36:41.330 --> 36:42.960
Be there in ten.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.500
Thirsty?

36:59.050 --> 37:01.750
I didn't think you'd do a press conference.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.820
I just threw it out there.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.020
That was really savage for something

37:08.620 --> 37:10.020
you just threw out there.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.060
That's all in your mind.

37:12.060 --> 37:13.130
You

37:13.330 --> 37:15.400
made me into a villain.

37:16.100 --> 37:19.470
You're the one who forgot the kind of bond

37:20.500 --> 37:21.370
we had.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.370
Let's go.

37:25.770 --> 37:27.170
Know this.

37:29.610 --> 37:30.610
I

37:31.350 --> 37:32.850
will not hurt you.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.060
Starpeace Seo Ji-han Urgent Press Conference

37:52.870 --> 37:54.100
Wow.

37:54.800 --> 37:57.970
You tossed my interview to someone else,

37:57.970 --> 37:58.940
but you're here.

37:58.940 --> 38:00.440
What's the press conference about?

38:00.640 --> 38:01.370
The new song, right?

38:01.370 --> 38:02.780
What else is there?

38:04.180 --> 38:06.080
Why didn't you take my interview?

38:06.780 --> 38:08.550
It would've sold well for a day.

38:08.550 --> 38:10.520
How could I take it?

38:10.620 --> 38:12.290
It was inconsistent.

38:12.450 --> 38:13.350
What?

38:14.320 --> 38:16.960
I published that exclusive,

38:17.120 --> 38:18.390
but it was strange.

38:18.690 --> 38:21.630
If Cotton copied it, why'd they bring it to you?

38:21.630 --> 38:23.660
I heard your side of the story.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.630
What I'm curious about now is Jenna's.

38:26.030 --> 38:26.970
Think about it.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.140
Crawling back to the house

38:29.140 --> 38:31.300
you stole from, and asking them to sell it.

38:31.300 --> 38:32.370
Does that make sense?

38:33.970 --> 38:35.840
It was a plan.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.410
To make an alibi.

38:37.410 --> 38:38.240
See?

38:38.240 --> 38:39.910
Even the great Reporter Mo is like this.

38:40.410 --> 38:43.020
She didn't need my producing in the first place.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.420
You don't know, do you?

38:44.420 --> 38:45.850
How manipulative she is.

38:49.330 --> 38:50.330
Let's start

38:50.840 --> 38:52.520
the press conference.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.720
First of all, I'm sorry for the short notice...

38:59.720 --> 39:02.000
I'll talk to them, Asst. Manager Park.

39:03.630 --> 39:05.170
Oh... Okay.

39:11.070 --> 39:12.350
I'm sorry this was done

39:12.540 --> 39:14.950
without any notice in advance.

39:14.950 --> 39:15.950
But...

39:16.790 --> 39:19.350
There's something I must tell you today,

39:19.350 --> 39:21.620
so I made an unreasonable request.

39:22.410 --> 39:23.340
Recently,

39:23.370 --> 39:25.070
there's been talk that Cotton Candy's

39:25.070 --> 39:26.870
and Mars' songs are similar.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.360
They got into a plagiarism controversy.

39:32.730 --> 39:33.730
Before Cotton Candy

39:34.070 --> 39:36.470
requested an arrangement

39:36.490 --> 39:38.490
to our producer Bbiyong,

39:38.690 --> 39:40.520
Mars Seo Ji-han Urgent Press Conference

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
our song was already finished.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.180
That's why

39:42.280 --> 39:44.880
the argument that it wasn't a coincidence,

39:45.130 --> 39:48.140
and that Cotton Candy plagiarized us gained ground.

39:49.210 --> 39:50.670
Rooster, that bastard!

39:50.670 --> 39:53.750
Before investigating how the song got leaked,

39:54.220 --> 39:57.760
public opinion leaned toward Cotton's plagiarism.

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
Then

40:00.300 --> 40:02.730
Cotton Candy announced their stance yesterday.

40:03.010 --> 40:04.010
They said

40:04.730 --> 40:07.630
this song was Kim Jenna's in the first place.

40:10.930 --> 40:11.930
I...

40:13.620 --> 40:14.770
Believe that.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.220
Our lead producer Bbiyong

40:22.310 --> 40:24.350
plagiarized Cotton Candy's song.

40:24.350 --> 40:25.350
No,

40:25.920 --> 40:27.050
he stole it.

40:43.580 --> 40:44.700
Rats!

40:47.580 --> 40:49.850
Listen to the end, Executive Bong.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.720
I apologize for not telling you

40:55.050 --> 40:56.410
the truth sooner.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.000
I always wondered

41:12.200 --> 41:15.200
if the time came for me to make a hard decision,

41:16.180 --> 41:18.180
what kind of person I would be.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.510
What would I do?

41:23.250 --> 41:24.680
A popular idol singer.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.480
The leader of Mars.

41:27.410 --> 41:29.680
A top star. But what else will define me?

41:31.430 --> 41:32.920
I've always wondered.

41:34.370 --> 41:37.560
I always imagined I'd do the right thing.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.160
But when it became a reality,

41:41.890 --> 41:44.360
I had to think what was advantageous or not.

41:55.440 --> 41:58.310
It would've been easier if it were just me.

41:59.130 --> 42:00.850
That's the excuse I'd like to give.

42:00.920 --> 42:04.220
Starpeace! Tell the truth! The truth!

42:04.220 --> 42:06.280
Starpeace! Tell the truth! The truth!

42:06.280 --> 42:09.420
I was afraid of the damage it would cause my team

42:09.800 --> 42:12.230
and fans, so I couldn't pluck up the courage.

42:13.140 --> 42:14.140
However,

42:15.000 --> 42:18.430
when I go back to the question of who I am...

42:19.180 --> 42:20.180
I had the answer.

42:20.700 --> 42:21.870
It's to be the person

42:22.100 --> 42:23.380
who can face you,

42:23.720 --> 42:26.910
here and now, and tell the truth.

42:28.260 --> 42:29.700
Even if I'm afraid

42:31.390 --> 42:33.070
of what might happen.

42:35.690 --> 42:37.820
I want to apologize to Cotton Candy

42:38.300 --> 42:40.160
who must've suffered greatly

42:40.710 --> 42:42.190
for the past two days.

42:56.850 --> 42:58.470
I'm deeply sorry

42:59.450 --> 43:01.130
toward my fans, Calla,

43:01.300 --> 43:03.380
for disappointing them.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.850
I also apologize to my team who suffered

43:07.850 --> 43:09.620
damage when they did no wrong.

43:12.730 --> 43:13.730
What's more

43:20.450 --> 43:21.960
I think it's only right

43:21.960 --> 43:24.530
that we stop the plans for the unit.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.270
What did he say?

43:34.250 --> 43:35.930
I knew he'd make trouble.

43:36.470 --> 43:37.470
Even if

43:37.640 --> 43:39.320
there is trial and error,

43:39.580 --> 43:41.910
we will always work toward being upright

43:42.450 --> 43:44.640
and do things to make each other proud.

43:45.030 --> 43:46.030
And

43:50.930 --> 43:52.530
I hope that the unit

43:53.240 --> 43:56.600
won't be just best friends singing together.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.730
You're the closest person to me.

44:03.100 --> 44:04.620
Let's do this well.

44:05.070 --> 44:05.420
Okay.

44:05.420 --> 44:06.420
Next year,

44:07.000 --> 44:10.200
I promise I'll gift you with a very special album.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.210
Please send the encouragement you gave us

44:16.400 --> 44:17.680
to Cotton Candy

44:18.660 --> 44:20.710
who's taking their last chance,

44:20.710 --> 44:21.750
and support them

44:22.340 --> 44:23.780
to the end.

44:24.410 --> 44:25.410
That is all.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.390
How did you know about the plagiarism?

44:30.390 --> 44:32.270
Producer Bbiyong told me himself.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.370
- Well...
- Did all

44:36.370 --> 44:37.970
the members agree to the press conference?

44:37.970 --> 44:40.050
Yes. They supported it.

44:40.050 --> 44:42.310
You didn't commit plagiarism yourself.

44:42.310 --> 44:44.410
Is it necessary to stop the unit plans?

44:44.590 --> 44:46.660
Ray will unintentionally be a victim.

44:46.660 --> 44:48.150
I suggested it.

44:49.630 --> 44:50.630
From the start,

44:51.310 --> 44:53.840
Ji-han was against the unit album.

44:54.340 --> 44:56.020
He said we weren't ready.

44:56.120 --> 44:59.060
He opposed getting Bbiyong's song like always.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.160
He felt like we were in a rut.

45:02.790 --> 45:05.330
But CEO Ma and I pushed ahead with it.

45:05.330 --> 45:07.060
Seeing the result of that,

45:07.240 --> 45:08.800
I think Ji-han's judgment is right.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.740
I suggested we postpone it to next year.

45:13.800 --> 45:14.840
No!

45:16.290 --> 45:17.580
It's not true.

45:18.200 --> 45:19.720
I've never plagiarized

45:19.720 --> 45:21.400
and I never said I did.

45:22.020 --> 45:23.700
I wrote the song first.

45:23.900 --> 45:25.340
You all know that.

45:25.860 --> 45:27.600
When CEO Ma was alive,

45:28.580 --> 45:30.640
Kim Jenna sent her song to him.

45:31.580 --> 45:33.300
How would I have known that?

45:33.540 --> 45:35.680
We found evidence that

45:35.700 --> 45:37.830
CEO Ma emailed Executive Bong the song.

45:40.230 --> 45:42.230
So that's why he went berserk.

45:42.440 --> 45:43.730
Trying to cover it up.

45:43.730 --> 45:44.740
No!

45:45.670 --> 45:47.040
This is a ploy.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.810
It's the agency's ploy to slander me.

45:50.310 --> 45:52.140
Why would we slander you?

45:52.360 --> 45:53.530
Ask Producer Bong

45:53.530 --> 45:55.050
for more information if you're interested.

45:55.050 --> 45:56.850
We'll end Ji-han's press conference now.

45:56.850 --> 45:58.130
Say goodbye and end this.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.930
Thank you for coming today.

46:03.550 --> 46:04.690
Wait, wait.

46:04.810 --> 46:05.940
Is it true you plagiarized?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.770
Seo Ji-han! Seo Ji-han!

46:08.200 --> 46:08.860
Please tell us.

46:25.740 --> 46:26.820
Before we send it off,

46:27.170 --> 46:29.020
I want to sing it for one last time.

46:31.770 --> 46:33.040
Is it a funeral again?

46:52.660 --> 46:56.290
I dreamt just the two of us flew the skies

46:56.780 --> 47:00.750
It might not be a dream, Babe

47:00.870 --> 47:04.010
We can fly, stepping on a cloud

47:04.010 --> 47:06.990
Carrying you, I fly far away, Baby

47:06.990 --> 47:09.320
I have no limits

47:09.560 --> 47:12.630
Go high, Go higher

47:12.940 --> 47:14.580
The whole world

47:14.770 --> 47:18.690
Becomes a lighthouse that shines our way

47:18.990 --> 47:20.810
Life is so sweet

47:21.100 --> 47:22.880
Us together

47:22.880 --> 47:25.960
Just being with you

47:25.990 --> 47:27.930
One of a kind on Earth

47:28.050 --> 47:30.760
You're the only one, my treasure

47:30.760 --> 47:34.980
Wherever we go

47:35.000 --> 47:39.090
Past the clouds and into space

47:39.090 --> 47:43.890
Forever I am your little prince

47:49.610 --> 47:52.170
Swim in the universe

47:57.730 --> 48:00.030
Swim in our universe

48:00.050 --> 48:01.920
It's not a momentary feeling

48:02.150 --> 48:03.930
I feel like we'll vow to last forever

48:03.960 --> 48:04.960
I...

48:05.640 --> 48:07.320
Think I'm in love with this song.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.320
This...

48:11.780 --> 48:13.060
This is my song.

48:13.970 --> 48:15.150
I'll protect you

48:15.150 --> 48:18.280
Go high, Go higher

48:18.320 --> 48:20.310
Like you're a star

48:20.310 --> 48:24.470
We'll be satellites circling around each other

48:24.730 --> 48:26.400
I'll surround you

48:24.830 --> 48:25.680
Move to trash can

48:26.540 --> 48:28.450
And you'll surround me

48:27.940 --> 48:29.350
Move to trash can

48:28.470 --> 48:29.820
We'll embrace each other

48:45.560 --> 48:47.450
True Love Oriental Medicine Clinic.

48:52.280 --> 48:54.350
True Love Oriental Medicine Clinic

48:53.540 --> 48:54.980
For the love of...

49:00.520 --> 49:02.640
Aunt

49:00.990 --> 49:03.750
Get his autograph, frame it and give it to me.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.560
"I love you, Aunt."

49:05.680 --> 49:07.910
Tell him to write that.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.910
If I hang it next to the door,

49:09.910 --> 49:11.880
my clinic will be a pilgrimage site in no time.

49:11.930 --> 49:13.330
I'm going to throw it away.

49:17.060 --> 49:18.060
Come here.

49:23.860 --> 49:24.860
Sign this.

49:34.470 --> 49:35.830
- Write.
- Write what?

49:36.070 --> 49:37.070
Aunt...

49:41.650 --> 49:42.590
Aunt...

49:42.590 --> 49:43.590
What?

49:43.990 --> 49:44.990
Jeez.

49:48.600 --> 49:49.990
Read that.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.390
I love you, Aunt

50:05.270 --> 50:07.070
She's touting for business.

50:08.780 --> 50:11.150
I can't believe she's making me do this.

50:12.610 --> 50:16.050
After I made that mess, I realized something.

50:18.070 --> 50:20.840
"It won't happen."

50:22.820 --> 50:24.750
After I took a step back, I could see.

50:26.540 --> 50:29.190
That I lost to a fear that had no substance.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.480
Ji-han.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.890
Actually, it might end up

50:37.490 --> 50:39.710
being less damaging than you think.

50:41.560 --> 50:43.740
You asked me how old I was back then.

50:46.150 --> 50:47.500
It was the best age

50:49.080 --> 50:50.780
to pluck up courage.

50:52.230 --> 50:54.920
There will be more chances to discard courage.

50:55.740 --> 50:57.000
Getting older means

50:58.400 --> 51:01.290
getting more accustomed to being cowardly.

51:02.530 --> 51:03.530
So...

51:05.040 --> 51:07.400
Do what you can now.

51:08.540 --> 51:10.310
That way, you'll have no regrets.

51:13.110 --> 51:14.230
By any chance,

51:15.300 --> 51:16.980
by a chance in a million,

51:19.020 --> 51:21.150
if something you fear happens...

51:25.170 --> 51:26.720
I'll take care of it.

51:31.990 --> 51:32.990
What?

51:33.800 --> 51:35.520
Why look at me in such a cheesy way?

51:35.520 --> 51:36.520
What?

51:41.720 --> 51:42.880
Starpeace...

51:45.800 --> 51:47.360
I came here because of you.

51:47.970 --> 51:49.980
You were so cheesy, you know.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.150
Unbelievable.

51:51.780 --> 51:53.640
I'm sorry,

51:53.800 --> 51:55.710
but I don't look at guys like that.

51:55.710 --> 51:56.710
Me, neither.

52:09.790 --> 52:12.910
He didn't have to stop the unit plans.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.450
I feel bad.

52:14.450 --> 52:15.850
Me, too.

52:15.850 --> 52:18.800
They have no middle ground.

52:20.950 --> 52:22.180
Looks good.

52:28.180 --> 52:29.770
Are the Callas still there?

52:32.440 --> 52:33.440
No.

52:33.830 --> 52:34.870
They're gone.

52:46.890 --> 52:47.890
Who is it?

52:48.490 --> 52:49.680
You're not going to answer?

52:50.300 --> 52:52.980
It's an unknown number.

53:06.950 --> 53:07.950
Yes?

53:13.020 --> 53:14.560
I postponed the vocal practice.

53:17.920 --> 53:20.360
It was a long day. Get some rest.

53:22.770 --> 53:23.770
Did you talk

53:24.600 --> 53:25.600
with Ji-han?

53:30.480 --> 53:32.370
I don't know what to say.

53:34.730 --> 53:36.410
Should I console him?

53:36.910 --> 53:38.540
Should I thank him?

53:41.160 --> 53:42.690
I feel uneasy.

53:42.860 --> 53:43.860
Yeah.

53:47.770 --> 53:49.750
I don't think he should've given up on the unit.

53:49.750 --> 53:51.430
It wasn't his fault.

53:56.130 --> 53:57.490
How's the agency?

53:58.270 --> 53:59.950
What's the vibe over there?

54:00.080 --> 54:01.650
They're calmer than I thought.

54:02.230 --> 54:04.080
I think they prepared for this.

54:14.860 --> 54:18.010
Regardless of you saying it's your song,

54:18.740 --> 54:20.420
I still love my song.

54:21.750 --> 54:23.550
I was happy, working on it.

54:25.750 --> 54:28.550
Just like when I first learned music,

54:30.330 --> 54:32.630
it felt like it woke up everything inside me.

54:33.890 --> 54:34.890
People might ask

54:36.120 --> 54:39.170
why we're making a fuss about one song.

54:39.170 --> 54:40.850
But people like us know.

54:42.750 --> 54:44.550
What it's like to encounter

54:45.970 --> 54:48.940
a hidden spring after wandering a winter forest.

54:51.350 --> 54:52.350
Even if

54:55.040 --> 54:56.720
it's someone else's garden.

54:58.600 --> 55:01.050
What I made there after? It's all mine.

55:01.890 --> 55:03.930
They're my own senses.

55:04.730 --> 55:06.140
I hope you know that.

55:17.150 --> 55:18.150
Thank you.

55:22.490 --> 55:23.790
Can I get your autograph?

55:23.900 --> 55:24.890
Yes, of course.

55:33.630 --> 55:34.630
Thank you.

55:36.090 --> 55:37.370
Have a good day.

55:37.710 --> 55:40.020
Then is this part

55:40.100 --> 55:41.710
Tae-young and Dan's?

55:41.830 --> 55:43.330
No, this is

55:43.430 --> 55:44.880
you and Ji-han's part.

55:44.880 --> 55:45.850
Oh.

55:45.910 --> 55:47.430
I think it's good.

55:47.650 --> 55:48.650
I like it.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.290
The burgers are here.

55:50.420 --> 55:52.100
- Welcome.
- Come on in.

55:52.460 --> 55:54.030
Great timing.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.900
There's fried chicken, too. Right?

55:55.900 --> 55:56.900
Is this it?

55:57.500 --> 55:58.460
Chicken, chicken, chicken.

55:58.510 --> 55:59.740
It's so tasty!

55:59.740 --> 56:02.250
I think if we double between the 2nd and 3rd bars,

56:02.250 --> 56:03.530
it'll be better.

56:03.610 --> 56:04.950
That part is a bit lax.

56:04.950 --> 56:05.950
Yeah.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.050
This is so good.

56:12.170 --> 56:13.780
Hey, this is awesome.

56:13.780 --> 56:15.740
Why do you like fried chicken so much?

56:15.800 --> 56:17.940
You know we have to go on a diet soon.

56:17.940 --> 56:19.960
Diet, my foot. You all look good.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.280
Fried chicken isn't fattening.

56:28.210 --> 56:29.210
What is it?

56:48.350 --> 56:49.350
Hello?

56:50.550 --> 56:51.830
What's going on?

56:52.080 --> 56:55.490
The line is busy. Please leave a message...

56:55.520 --> 56:57.370
You renounced the song?

56:57.470 --> 56:59.400
I didn't step down so you could do this!

57:00.710 --> 57:02.840
What is it that you really want?

57:03.890 --> 57:05.380
Let's meet and talk.

57:11.110 --> 57:12.110
Tell us.

57:12.630 --> 57:14.630
Why did you renounce the song?

57:17.940 --> 57:19.380
Because of Ji-han.

57:22.170 --> 57:23.530
What do you mean?

57:25.300 --> 57:27.410
You said you're in love with the song.

57:27.410 --> 57:28.410
That's...

57:28.600 --> 57:30.590
I put myself in your shoes.

57:30.590 --> 57:33.660
The person I love goes to be with someone else.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.420
That was a bad metaphor.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Anyway.

57:42.670 --> 57:44.430
It felt like the right thing to do.

57:44.430 --> 57:45.450
It isn't the right time

57:45.450 --> 57:47.560
for this baby to come out in this world.

57:47.720 --> 57:49.480
I felt I should consider you

57:49.660 --> 57:51.380
since you had to bury it in your heart.

57:51.400 --> 57:52.170
I'm okay.

57:52.170 --> 57:53.530
I don't think so.

57:54.200 --> 57:55.490
It's my baby.

57:55.830 --> 57:57.430
But it's also yours.

57:57.460 --> 57:58.810
You keep saying "baby."

58:03.690 --> 58:06.330
This metaphor is weird, too.

58:07.610 --> 58:08.610
Anyway.

58:08.810 --> 58:10.670
Wasn't that what you meant?

58:11.530 --> 58:12.860
Don't worry.

58:13.600 --> 58:15.280
It's not the right time,

58:15.580 --> 58:17.760
but I will let it out some day.

58:18.420 --> 58:19.700
Is it this easy?

58:20.060 --> 58:21.270
If it was, why did you...?

58:21.270 --> 58:22.560
Does it look easy to you?

58:25.280 --> 58:26.890
It wasn't easy at all.

58:27.540 --> 58:29.060
How can it be easy?

58:34.960 --> 58:35.960
Kim Jenna.

58:37.450 --> 58:38.750
Is this your team's opinion?

58:38.900 --> 58:39.830
Yes.

58:40.170 --> 58:42.500
Because Ji-han gave up on the unit,

58:42.510 --> 58:44.620
we all feel like sinners.

58:45.740 --> 58:47.840
So what will you do then?

58:48.580 --> 58:50.100
Give up on the album?

58:50.790 --> 58:51.790
No.

58:52.840 --> 58:54.520
We have another song.

58:55.890 --> 58:59.080
I had sent CEO Ma two songs.

59:01.250 --> 59:02.250
And...

59:03.390 --> 59:04.430
To be honest,

59:04.980 --> 59:06.660
the other song is better.

59:07.540 --> 59:09.490
I don't believe that woman.

59:23.390 --> 59:24.390
Okay.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.040
Let me join in.

59:26.870 --> 59:28.440
- What?
- What?

59:29.090 --> 59:31.630
Let me join in on producing it.

59:42.730 --> 59:43.730
What?

59:44.890 --> 59:45.860
Isn't it a good idea?

59:45.860 --> 59:46.680
No, it isn't.

59:46.680 --> 59:47.680
Yes, it is.

59:48.110 --> 59:49.790
Cotton Candy's new song

59:50.010 --> 59:52.610
is jointly produced by Troy and Ji-han.

59:53.750 --> 59:55.030
They'll go wild.

59:55.860 --> 59:57.160
Are you teasing me?

59:57.180 --> 59:58.220
I'm serious.

59:59.350 --> 1:00:00.630
Are you getting revenge?

1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.160
You call this revenge?

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:02.850
Are you kidding?

1:00:02.850 --> 1:00:04.370
You know what you always say.

1:00:05.310 --> 1:00:06.830
"Calla won't stand by and watch."

1:00:07.100 --> 1:00:08.460
"They'll destroy Cotton Candy."

1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:09.240
Hey.

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:12.380
You just insulted my fans.

1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.000
I'm asking you for a favor.

1:00:22.220 --> 1:00:24.690
It's like the last piece of our puzzle.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:27.440
Let's put the puzzle together.

1:00:28.670 --> 1:00:30.100
Remember what you said to me?

1:00:30.940 --> 1:00:33.820
You asked if I thought we can really be one team.

1:00:35.480 --> 1:00:36.980
I believe we can.

1:00:38.230 --> 1:00:39.430
What about you?

1:00:42.950 --> 1:00:44.500
Maybe you forgot.

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:46.250
But us two?

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:47.850
We work

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:49.940
in perfect harmony.

1:01:16.570 --> 1:01:17.940
Mars Ji-han joins in on producing
Cotton Candy's different new song

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.670
Jenna and Ji-han who were caught up
in plagiarism issue are working together

1:01:19.670 --> 1:01:21.260
Cotton Candy and Mars,
will they show their synergy once more?

1:01:35.620 --> 1:01:37.200
Up the ante! Getting cleared from plagiarism,
Cotton Candy gets Mars Ji-han's producing

1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:38.950

1:01:38.950 --> 1:01:40.910
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend!
Supports Cotton Candy as their producer

1:01:42.750 --> 1:01:43.870
Director Yoon!

Mars Ji-han becomes Cotton Candy's producer

1:02:21.390 --> 1:02:22.690
It's game over.

1:02:56.090 --> 1:02:57.090
You're here.

1:03:26.380 --> 1:03:27.580
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.210
Congratulations on your first signing event.

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:30.140
Cotton Candy Fan Signing Event

1:03:29.220 --> 1:03:30.680
Becoming No.1, then disbanding.

1:03:30.680 --> 1:03:31.910
Will you go to the end?

1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:32.730
Yes.

1:03:32.730 --> 1:03:33.580
We will

1:03:33.740 --> 1:03:34.480
disband.

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.480
Hello.

1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:38.290
There's something I didn't tell you.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:39.760
I can't be here.

1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:41.540
Even if we release it now, I bet we'll be No.1.

1:03:41.540 --> 1:03:43.810
We worked really hard.

1:03:43.810 --> 1:03:45.490
Don't tell the others.

1:03:45.590 --> 1:03:47.400
I hate that I'm different from you.

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:49.710
Why do you think you're different from us?

1:03:49.890 --> 1:03:51.170
Let's stop here.

1:03:51.350 --> 1:03:53.300
I called you to see you before I left.

1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:54.500
Let's end this.
