WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:03.629
PREVIOUSLY
ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:03.629 --> 00:06.924
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
AS BAD AS THIS.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.926
CHEF RAMSAY WAS FORCED
INTO BATTLE

00:08.926 --> 00:11.178
WITH ONE OF THE MOST VOCAL
AND DEFIANT OWNERS

00:11.178 --> 00:12.804
HE HAS EVER ENCOUNTERED.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.973
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MAKE ME LASAGNA FOR TONIGHT!

00:14.973 --> 00:17.267
JULIE WATSON BOUGHT
A FAST-FOOD JOINT

00:17.267 --> 00:19.811
AND TRIED TO TURN IT
INTO HER DREAM RESTAURANT...

00:19.811 --> 00:22.022
GO TO THE WINDOW--
THIS HAS TO BE A FIRST.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.107
AND ALTHOUGH SHE CHANGED
THE MENU TO ITALIAN,

00:24.107 --> 00:25.984
HER STANDARDS ARE NO BETTER...

00:25.984 --> 00:27.778
JUST DO WHATEVER YOU GUYS
WANT TO DO. HOW'S THAT?

00:27.778 --> 00:29.071
AND MAYBE WORSE...

00:29.071 --> 00:30.000
WOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.614
WOW, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.033
THAN THE FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT
THAT WAS ONCE THERE.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.410
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING ITALIAN
IN HERE WHATSOEVER.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.246
I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.664
ONLY MOMENTS
AFTER GORDON ARRIVED,

00:38.664 --> 00:40.332
IT BECAME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

00:40.332 --> 00:42.209
THAT THIS BUSINESS
WAS DYSFUNCTIONAL...

00:42.209 --> 00:43.752
YOU TRIED TO PUNCH ME.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.171
AND THAT THE MORALE
WAS EXTREMELY LOW.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.632
NO ONE CARES IF I GET FIRED.
NO ONE CARES ABOUT ME.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.175
THE FOOD WAS DISGUSTING.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.177
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE HORROR.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.220
AND SO WAS THE KITCHEN.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.888
I TOLD YOU NOT TO USE
THAT MICROWAVE.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.515
KISS MY ASS.

00:56.515 --> 00:59.017
AFTER DISCOVERING THAT
ALL THE PASTA WAS PREMADE...

00:59.017 --> 01:00.000
HE'S NEVER MADE 'EM
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.769
HE'S NEVER MADE 'EM
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.730
CHEF RAMSAY ASKED HEAD CHEF,
TREVOR, FOR FRESH PASTA.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.275
IT'S TOO OILY. IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE DOUGH, NOT PASTE.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.151
BUT TREVOR COULDN'T DELIVER.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.028
A CHEF THAT DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE PASTA,

01:10.028 --> 01:11.989
AND YOU'RE THE HEAD CHEF
OF AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT?

01:11.989 --> 01:13.865
ALTHOUGH CHEF RAMSAY
POINTED OUT

01:13.865 --> 01:16.076
HOW DIRE THE SITUATION
REALLY WAS...

01:16.076 --> 01:18.328
MEATBALLS--FROZEN.
SAUCE--WATERY.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.664
LASAGNA--THEY CAN'T EVEN
REHEAT IT PROPERLY.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.249
JULIE REFUSED TO ACCEPT IT.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.001
I THINK OUR FOOD'S GOOD.
OH, COME ON.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.211
I'M STANDING BY MY FOOD.
OH, MY GOD.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.881
AT DINNER SERVICE, THERE WERE
MORE SHOCKING REVELATIONS.

01:29.881 --> 01:30.000
THAT'S THE SPINACH
FROM BEHIND THE LINE.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.966
THAT'S THE SPINACH
FROM BEHIND THE LINE.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.467
IT'S YELLOW AND LIMP.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.011
OUR SPINACH HAS NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER,

01:34.011 --> 01:35.554
NEVER, NEVER LOOKED
LIKE THIS.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.764
OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNTS
OF PRECOOKED PASTA,

01:37.764 --> 01:40.809
ENOUGH TO FEED
A PACKED RESTAURANT FOR WEEKS...

01:40.809 --> 01:42.436
WHAT FRUITCAKE'S
OPERATING THIS?

01:42.436 --> 01:45.856
AND THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY
OF THE FOOD WAS COOKED--

01:45.856 --> 01:48.984
SOMETIMES TWICE--
IN A MICROWAVE.

01:48.984 --> 01:52.821
IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS,
JULIE REMAINED IN DENIAL MODE.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.948
YOU THINK IT'S OKAY
TO SERVE FROZEN MEATBALLS?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.409
THEY'RE NOT FROZEN.
THEY START OUT FROZEN.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.119
WOULDN'T THAT BE FROZEN?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.000
DESPERATELY LOOKING
FOR A WAY

02:00.000 --> 02:00.287
DESPERATELY LOOKING
FOR A WAY

02:00.287 --> 02:01.913
TO GET THROUGH
TO THE STUBBORN OWNER...

02:01.913 --> 02:03.582
JULIE,
YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?

02:03.582 --> 02:06.835
CHEF RAMSAY ASKED THE CUSTOMERS
ONE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.211
WHEN YOU COME OUT
TO DINNER,

02:08.211 --> 02:11.340
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT MENU
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO BE FRESH?

02:11.340 --> 02:13.091
- 90% TO 100%.
- 90% TO 100%,

02:13.091 --> 02:16.053
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT EVEN 5% FRESH.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.138
JULIE COULDN'T HANDLE
THE UGLY TRUTH...

02:18.138 --> 02:20.182
I'M LEAVING.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.600
AND DECIDED SHE HAD ENOUGH.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.268
JULIE.
I'M NOT TAKING
ANY MORE.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.311
I'M WALKING OUT.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.604
YOU'RE WALKING OUT?

02:25.604 --> 02:29.358
I CANNOT DO THAT.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.000
TONIGHT THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION
OF MANGIA MANGIA...

02:30.000 --> 02:32.819
TONIGHT THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION
OF MANGIA MANGIA...

02:32.819 --> 02:35.447
GET A GRIP FAST.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.157
WILL JULIE BAIL
ON HER RESTAURANT?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.117
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.662
IN ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i> EVER...

02:41.662 --> 02:42.746
I'M SO STRESSED OUT.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.956
YOU WILL WITNESS
STUNNING REVELATIONS...

02:44.956 --> 02:45.957
WHO'S ON DRUGS?

02:45.957 --> 02:46.958
BETRAYAL...

02:46.958 --> 02:49.002
YOU ARE  LYING.
WHO INTERROGATES IT?

02:49.002 --> 02:50.003
AND DISAPPOINTMENT...

02:50.003 --> 02:51.004
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.714
AS CHEF RAMSAY IS FORCED

02:52.714 --> 02:55.676
TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING
HE HAS NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.928
THIS IS NOT WORKING
FOR ME ANYMORE.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.765
WHAT IS THAT?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.475
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.601
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

03:04.601 --> 03:07.020
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

03:07.020 --> 03:08.105
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

03:08.105 --> 03:09.022
GET OUT OF HERE!

03:09.022 --> 03:11.024
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:13.151
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

03:13.151 --> 03:16.154
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.161
<i>JUST OUT OF INTEREST,</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:24.788
<i>WHEN YOU DECIDED</i>
<i>TO COME HERE THIS EVENING,</i>

03:24.788 --> 03:26.081
<i>YOU LOOK AT THE MENU.</i>

03:26.081 --> 03:28.959
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT MENU
WOULD YOU EXPECT TO BE FRESH?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.000
<i>LET'S START FROM TABLE</i>
<i>TO TABLE.</i>

03:30.000 --> 03:30.293
<i>LET'S START FROM TABLE</i>
<i>TO TABLE.</i>

03:30.293 --> 03:31.878
LADIES?
90% TO 100%.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.005
90% TO 100%.
90% TO 100%.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.924
90% TO 100%. MADAM?
90% TO 100%.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.176
90% TO 100%.
90% TO 100%.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.469
SIR?
100% ALL THE WAY.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.971
100% ALL THE WAY.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.223
WELL, I AM DEEPLY SORRY,
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.684
IT'S NOT EVEN 5% FRESH.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.479
<i>IT WAS OBVIOUS.</i>

03:49.479 --> 03:52.190
<i>AND 95% OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE</i>
<i>EATEN THIS EVENING IS FROZEN.</i>

03:52.190 --> 03:53.733
AND YOU CAN COOK BETTER
AT HOME, YES?

03:53.733 --> 03:54.860
- YEP.
<i>- YES.</i>

03:54.860 --> 03:58.029
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
IT'S FINE NOW?

03:58.029 --> 03:59.739
- I'M LEAVING.
<i>- YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY?</i>

03:59.739 --> 04:00.000
<i>I'M NOT TAKING ANY MORE.</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:01.158
<i>I'M NOT TAKING ANY MORE.</i>

04:01.158 --> 04:02.659
JULIE.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.827
WALKING OUT.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.163
YOU'RE WALKING OUT?
WOW.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.372
<i>JUST NOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT.</i>

04:07.372 --> 04:10.125
I'M NOT GONNA BE
SCREAMED AT LIKE THAT.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.002
- I CAN'T DO IT.
<i>- JULIE.</i>

04:12.002 --> 04:16.006
I CANNOT DO THAT.
I'M WALKING OUT.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.800
I'M DONE.
YOU DON'T CARE.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.719
YOU'RE SCREAMING AT ME
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.970
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
LISTEN.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.263
I DO LISTEN.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.016
YOU DO NOT LISTEN.
I WAS PROVING A POINT.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.976
I WASN'T SCREAMING AT YOU.
I DON'T--UGH.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.978
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY HERE?

04:29.978 --> 04:30.000
I WANT YOU TO WAKE UP.
YOU'RE BELITTLING ME.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.022
I WANT YOU TO WAKE UP.
YOU'RE BELITTLING ME.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.023
YOU'RE--YOU'RE--
I AM BELITTLING YOU?

04:33.023 --> 04:34.524
YOU'RE TEARING ME APART.

04:34.524 --> 04:37.694
SO YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY?

04:37.694 --> 04:40.113
I DON'T KNOW.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.865
YOU DON'T KNOW?
I-I AM--I-I--

04:41.865 --> 04:45.285
OKAY, 90% TO 95% FRESH.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.996
THAT'S WHAT THEY CAME
TO YOUR RESTAURANT FOR,

04:47.996 --> 04:49.706
AND EVERYTHING
I'VE SHOWED YOU TONIGHT,

04:49.706 --> 04:51.708
YOU'RE BLAMING
YOUR CHEFS.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.461
I AM NOT BLAMING MY CHEFS.
YOU CAN ASK--

04:54.461 --> 04:57.088
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR A LOT OF THE

04:57.088 --> 04:58.882
THAT GOES ON
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.000
<i>HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL HERE.</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:00.675
<i>HONESTLY, I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL HERE.</i>

05:00.675 --> 05:03.470
YOU RUN AND DO WHAT YOU CAN
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

05:03.470 --> 05:04.763
UNTIL YOUR SHIFT'S OVER.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.431
AND THAT'S IT?
<i>THAT'S IT.</i>

05:06.431 --> 05:09.017
YOU GUYS HAVE NEVER SAID
THIS KIND OF STUFF TO ME, EVER.

05:09.017 --> 05:09.976
<i>EVER.</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:11.269
I SAY STUFF ALL THE TIME.

05:11.269 --> 05:13.063
<i>YOU NEVER SAY</i>
<i>ANYTHING, KEVIN!</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:14.481
I'VE ASKED
FOR A CLEANING LIST.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.192
CLEANING LIST FOR THE BACK AREA
TO KEEP  CLEAN.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.195
HOW LONG AGO WAS THIS?
THREE WEEKS AGO?

05:20.195 --> 05:22.364
THANK YOU.
WHERE IS IT?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.866
YOU KNOW, LIKE, COMMON STUFF
TO CLEAN, WHERE IS IT?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.368
HEY, KEVIN, LET'S TALK
ABOUT ALL THE TIMES

05:26.368 --> 05:28.036
YOU HAVEN'T SHOWED UP TO WORK
WITH YOUR TIE.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.079
TWO TIMES.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.000
YOU'RE SO DISRESPECTFUL
TO HER!

05:30.000 --> 05:30.413
YOU'RE SO DISRESPECTFUL
TO HER!

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
YOU NEED TO SHOW
A LITTLE RESPECT!

05:32.040 --> 05:34.292
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO
ANYTHING WE HAVE TO  SAY!

05:34.292 --> 05:36.169
SHE TRIES TO, BUT YOU GUYS
DON'T EVEN GIVE HER A CHANCE!

05:36.169 --> 05:39.422
YOU GUYS, I HAVE TALKED TO YOU
100 TIMES. STOP.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.508
<i>I HAVE TALKED TO YOU</i>
<i>OVER AND OVER AND OVER.</i>

05:41.508 --> 05:44.177
- YOU KNOW I HAVE, TREVOR.
- YOU'RE  LYING. YOU ARE.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.262
WHAT--

05:45.262 --> 05:47.055
I HAVE SAT DOWN AND TALKED
TO YOU SO MANY TIMES AND SAID,

05:47.055 --> 05:48.682
"WHAT CAN WE DO
TO MAKE THIS BETTER?"

05:48.682 --> 05:50.267
AND YOU NEVER
SAY ANYTHING.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.852
SO THAT'S A  LIE.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.979
'CAUSE EVERY TIME I DO
SAY SOMETHING, GET SHUT DOWN!

05:53.979 --> 05:55.647
YOU ARE  LYING.

05:55.647 --> 05:57.065
WHATEVER.

05:57.065 --> 06:00.000
SHE'S GIVEN YOU SO MANY CHANCES,
TREVOR, AND YOU KNOW IT.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.694
SHE'S GIVEN YOU SO MANY CHANCES,
TREVOR, AND YOU KNOW IT.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.196
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR HABITS
FOR A SECOND

06:03.196 --> 06:05.448
AND ALL THE TIMES
YOU COME IN SO HIGH

06:05.448 --> 06:07.450
THAT YOU THROW
AT THE WALLS,

06:07.450 --> 06:09.244
SO HIGH THAT YOU WANT
TO  PUNCH--

06:09.244 --> 06:11.204
WHO INTERROGATES IT?
YOU!

06:11.204 --> 06:13.707
NO, YOU--
<i>YOU GET  OUT</i>
<i>OF THIS RESTAURANT,</i>

06:13.707 --> 06:15.041
AND WE CAN WORK!

06:15.041 --> 06:16.501
<i>NO, I DON'T</i>
<i>YOU ANYTHING!</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:19.921
YOU'RE SO HIGH ALL THE
TIME THAT WHEN YOU GO OFF

06:19.921 --> 06:22.173
DRUGS,
YOU GET SO ANGRY

06:22.173 --> 06:25.135
<i>THAT YOU</i>
<i>DON'T EVEN WANT TO WORK!</i>
DRUGS? WHO'S ON DRUGS?

06:25.135 --> 06:26.219
HE'S A  TWEAKER!

06:27.846 --> 06:29.890
AND YOU  KNOW
YOU'RE A TWEAKER!

06:29.890 --> 06:30.000
<i>YOU'VE BEEN DOING DRUGS</i>
<i>FOR THREE YEARS!</i>

06:30.000 --> 06:31.558
<i>YOU'VE BEEN DOING DRUGS</i>
<i>FOR THREE YEARS!</i>

06:31.558 --> 06:32.893
<i>JANELLE, JANELLE, COME HERE.</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:34.185
JANELLE, COME HERE.
COME HERE, COME HERE, COME HERE.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.229
NO!  HIM!

06:36.229 --> 06:38.607
HE DESERVES TO BE FIRED,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

06:38.607 --> 06:41.276
HE TRIED
TO  PUNCH ME!

06:41.276 --> 06:42.986
<i>AND IF I WERE TO LET HIM</i>
<i>RIGHT NOW, HE'D PROBABLY...</i>

06:42.986 --> 06:44.112
JANELLE, JANELLE--

06:44.112 --> 06:45.113
PUNCH ME AGAIN!

06:45.113 --> 06:48.074
HE'S SUCH A
AND SO DISRESPECTFUL!

06:48.074 --> 06:49.784
OKAY, STAY AWAY
FROM HERE NOW.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.202
DARLING, GO INSIDE
THE RESTAURANT, PLEASE,

06:51.202 --> 06:54.080
AND GET A GLASS OF WATER,
PLEASE.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.918
THAT IS NOT RIGHT.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.424
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN BUILDING UP?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.176
A LONG TIME.

07:10.972 --> 07:16.186
THE WAY YOU'RE RUNNING
THIS PLACE IS INCORRECT.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.689
<i>HOW IN THE HELL</i>
<i>ARE THESE DOORS STILL OPEN?</i>

07:19.689 --> 07:23.318
BECAUSE I FIGHT AND BATTLE
TO KEEP THE RESTAURANT TOGETHER.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.861
FOR WHAT?

07:24.861 --> 07:26.738
BECAUSE I WANT IT
TO SUCCEED.

07:26.738 --> 07:27.989
WHY DO YOU WANT IT
TO SUCCEED?

07:27.989 --> 07:30.000
BECAUSE IT'S
MY RESTAURANT.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.117
BECAUSE IT'S
MY RESTAURANT.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.994
IT'S MY RESTAURANT.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.789
YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES
IT'S GOOD TO STOP COMPLETELY

07:35.789 --> 07:37.666
AND START AGAIN.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.084
YOU'RE JUST CONTINUING.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.044
I'M NOT TRYING TO RUB YOUR FACE
IN IT, BUT WHEN YOU TELL ME--

07:41.044 --> 07:42.796
BUT THAT'S
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.422
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.007
<i>'CAUSE YOU'RE TELLING ME</i>
<i>THAT'S WHAT THE CUSTOMERS WANT.</i>

07:46.007 --> 07:47.967
<i>YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CRITICISM.</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:49.260
<i>I CAN TAKE IT.</i>

07:49.260 --> 07:50.887
<i>NO, YOU CAN'T.</i>
<i>YES, I CAN.</i>

07:50.887 --> 07:52.555
YOU'RE GONNA STAND THERE
AND ARGUE THAT THE

07:52.555 --> 07:54.974
THAT YOU'RE DEFROSTING
AND COOK IN THE MICROWAVE

07:54.974 --> 07:57.227
<i>IS WHAT THE LOCALS WANT.</i>

07:57.227 --> 07:59.729
LUNCHTIME, YOU KEPT ON
TELLING ME, "MY FOOD'S GOOD.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.000
MY FOOD'S GOOD.
MY FOOD'S GOOD."

08:00.000 --> 08:02.148
MY FOOD'S GOOD.
MY FOOD'S GOOD."

08:02.148 --> 08:05.151
AND THEN ALL NIGHT,
EVERY 15 MINUTES,

08:05.151 --> 08:07.195
SOMETHING ELSE CROPS UP,
OR THAT'S BEEN DEFROSTED,

08:07.195 --> 08:10.031
OR THAT'S FROZEN,
OR THAT'S THE--CRAZY.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.826
<i>COOKING VEGETARIAN DISHES</i>
<i>IN THE SAME BREAD CRUMBS</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:14.285
<i>THAT YOU WERE</i>
<i>WITH CHICKEN PARM.</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:17.455
AND YOU HAVE A CATERING COMPANY
THAT PROVIDES FROZEN FOOD.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.707
YOU DEFROST IT.

08:18.707 --> 08:22.419
HE REHEATS IT
AND THROWS IT OUT THERE.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.754
CUSTOMERS
AREN'T THAT STUPID!

08:26.756 --> 08:28.967
I'M SORRY,
BUT THE TRUTH HURTS.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.000
AND I'VE CLOSED
A RESTAURANT BEFORE.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.635
AND I'VE CLOSED
A RESTAURANT BEFORE.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.555
I'VE FAILED IN MY HOMETOWN,
BUT I DON'T STAND THERE

08:33.555 --> 08:36.141
WITH THE ARROGANCE,
THINKING, "IT'S PERFECT."

08:36.141 --> 08:38.059
I NEVER SAID
IT WAS PERFECT.

08:38.059 --> 08:41.020
SO WHY ARE YOU TAKING
THEIR MONEY?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.814
BECAUSE I'M TRYING.

08:42.814 --> 08:46.776
HOW ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE
THEIR EXPERIENCE A BIT BETTER?

08:46.776 --> 08:49.237
OR YOU'RE NOT UP FOR THAT?
I AM UP FOR THAT.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.072
ARE YOU?
YES, I AM.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.699
SO WHERE'S
THAT PASSION, THEN?

08:52.699 --> 08:53.867
I HAVE PASSION.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.077
WHERE? WHAT DISH?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.538
I DON'T KNOW.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.000
I'M JUST...

09:00.000 --> 09:00.498
I'M JUST...

09:00.498 --> 09:02.125
EXHAUSTED.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.962
I'M STRUGGLING TO FIND
ANYTHING POSITIVE.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.131
I'M STRUGGLING
TO TASTE SOMETHING

09:08.131 --> 09:11.926
THAT SHOULD BE SERVED
IN A RESTAURANT.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.679
<i>AND THIS IS NOT</i>
<i>HOW RESTAURANTS RUN.</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:17.307
TRUST ME--
THIS IS NOT NORMAL.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.018
I THOUGHT
IT WAS NORMAL.

09:20.018 --> 09:24.481
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING RIGHT.

09:24.481 --> 09:28.276
I DON'T THINK
THEY EVEN ENJOY

09:28.276 --> 09:29.986
<i>SERVING THAT.</i>

09:29.986 --> 09:30.000
APPARENTLY, I'M DOING IT
ALL  WRONG.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.031
APPARENTLY, I'M DOING IT
ALL  WRONG.

09:33.031 --> 09:36.034
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.955
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M WAITING FOR.

09:40.955 --> 09:44.667
GET A GRIP FAST.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.800
FINISH CIGARETTE
AND CLEAR DOWN.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.114
MY HEAD IS JUST SPINNING.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.076
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING IT RIGHT.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.120
I DID.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.121
I DID.

10:26.835 --> 10:30.000
AND WHEN CHEF RAMSAY SAID THAT
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THIS PLACE,

10:30.000 --> 10:30.213
AND WHEN CHEF RAMSAY SAID THAT
I DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THIS PLACE,

10:30.213 --> 10:32.132
I DO.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.802
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T BE HERE
DOING THIS RIGHT NOW.

10:48.355 --> 10:50.441
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE CHEF RAMSAY HAS SEEN

10:50.441 --> 10:53.944
SO MUCH TENSION BETWEEN AN OWNER
AND A KITCHEN STAFF.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.779
LET'S GO IN THE DINING ROOM
AND HAVE A QUICK CATCH-UP.

10:55.779 --> 10:57.906
BEFORE HE CAN EVEN BEGIN
TO PUSH FORWARD

10:57.906 --> 10:59.825
WITH IMPROVEMENTS
TO THE RESTAURANT,

10:59.825 --> 11:02.286
HE KNOWS HE NEEDS TO HAVE
A HEART-TO-HEART

11:02.286 --> 11:03.746
WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO WORK IN IT.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.706
OKAY, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ALL AS A GROUP.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.750
<i>YESTERDAY WAS A BAD DAY.</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:10.461
THE ATMOSPHERE IN HERE
IS DREADFUL.

11:10.461 --> 11:14.060
<i>THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD.</i>
<i>THIS WAS UGLY.</i>

11:14.060 --> 11:14.089
<i>THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BAD.</i>
<i>THIS WAS UGLY.</i>

11:14.089 --> 11:16.050
<i>I HAVE TO SAY</i>
<i>THAT SOME OF THE THINGS</i>

11:16.050 --> 11:17.801
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY,
I WAS STUNNED.

11:17.801 --> 11:21.722
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TALKED TO
BY MY STAFF, EVER.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.975
<i>LAST NIGHT WHEN KEVIN</i>
<i>TALKED TO ME THE WAY HE DID,</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:26.226
<i>I WAS SHOCKED.</i>

11:26.226 --> 11:29.063
KEVIN HAS NEVER RAISED
HIS VOICE TO ME, EVER.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.439
EVERYTHING WAS
AT A BOILING POINT.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.107
<i>THERE'S A FEAR AROUND HERE.</i>

11:32.107 --> 11:34.026
EVERYBODY'S WALKING
ON EGGSHELLS.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.903
THEY'RE SO AFRAID
THAT THEY THINK

11:35.903 --> 11:37.905
<i>SHE'S GONNA JUMP</i>
<i>OFF THE HANDLE</i>

11:37.905 --> 11:41.408
BECAUSE SHE'S SO FRANTIC
THAT WE'RE ALL ON EDGE.

11:41.408 --> 11:43.160
THAT ISN'T TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.060
I AM VERY FORGIVING.

11:44.060 --> 11:44.578
I AM VERY FORGIVING.

11:44.578 --> 11:45.746
THAT'S A BLATANT LIE.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.039
<i>YOU WERE SO RUDE</i>

11:47.039 --> 11:48.832
<i>AND SO DISRESPECTFUL</i>
<i>TO ME LAST NIGHT.</i>

11:48.832 --> 11:50.209
<i>HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO ACT?</i>

11:50.209 --> 11:51.418
I NEVER SAID A WORD TO YOU.

11:51.418 --> 11:52.836
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I WAS THE COMPUTER.

11:52.836 --> 11:54.963
YOU GONNA TELL ME TO HURRY UP,
GET OUT THE WAY?

11:54.963 --> 11:56.965
JULIE, WHY DID YOU
GO AFTER CHRIS?

11:56.965 --> 11:59.551
I'VE HAD CUSTOMERS
IN THIS LAST WEEK,

11:59.551 --> 12:01.887
TOLD ME THAT CHRIS IS
IN THE RESTAURANT,

12:01.887 --> 12:04.681
TALKING ,
SAYING WHAT A BITCH I AM.

12:04.681 --> 12:06.642
IS THIS LEGIT?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.852
THIS IS LEGIT.

12:08.852 --> 12:10.145
ALL RIGHT, I--
AND I HAVE--

12:10.145 --> 12:12.189
I MEAN, IF SHE'S GONNA SAY THAT,

12:12.189 --> 12:14.060
<i>THEN SHE'S FORCING ME</i>
<i>TO DEFEND MYSELF.</i>

12:14.060 --> 12:14.650
<i>THEN SHE'S FORCING ME</i>
<i>TO DEFEND MYSELF.</i>

12:14.650 --> 12:15.818
SAY WHAT YOU WANT, CHRIS.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.195
SHE HAS PEOPLE CALLING HER
A BITCH ON A DAILY BASIS,

12:18.195 --> 12:22.658
OUT LOUD, IN FRONT OF HER FACE,
AND I HAVE DEFENDED HER.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.701
WELL, I'VE HEARD THAT--
AND IT'S--IT'S--IT'S--

12:24.701 --> 12:25.869
YOU KNOW--

12:25.869 --> 12:27.788
NO, I'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAYING
THAT YOU'RE TALKING

12:27.788 --> 12:29.915
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT YOU THINK
IS WRONG WITH THE RESTAURANT.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.167
HAVE I BEEN TALKING ABOUT
WHAT I THINK THE PROBLEMS IS,

12:32.167 --> 12:34.670
<i>WHAT I THINK THAT COULD HELP</i>
<i>THIS PLACE OUT? ABSOLUTELY.</i>

12:34.670 --> 12:37.548
DID I EVER ONCE BAD-MOUTH HER?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

12:37.548 --> 12:38.841
YES, YOU DID.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.552
I DID NOT ONCE SAY ANYTHING.
IF I'VE SAID ANYTHING,

12:41.552 --> 12:44.060
IT'S THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
AROUND HER ARE INCOMPETENT.

12:44.060 --> 12:44.805
IT'S THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
AROUND HER ARE INCOMPETENT.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.723
AND SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO BE PISSED OFF.

12:46.723 --> 12:48.016
THAT'S WHAT I'VE SAID.

12:48.016 --> 12:49.435
<i>I NEVER SAID ANYTHING...</i>
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.228
<i>ABOUT HER IN</i>
<i>A DISRESPECTFUL WAY.</i>

12:51.228 --> 12:52.646
THAT'S B. S.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.189
<i>SO DON'T TELL ME</i>
<i>THAT I DON'T COME IN HERE</i>

12:54.189 --> 12:55.357
<i>AND DO WHAT</i>
<i>I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.</i>

12:55.357 --> 12:56.817
DON'T TELL ME THAT I DON'T.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.235
I'VE HAD MORE PEOPLE TELL ME,

12:58.235 --> 12:59.611
"THIS IS THE BEST SERVICE
I'VE HAD,

12:59.611 --> 13:00.821
AND I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
SINCE THIS PLACE WAS OPEN."

13:00.821 --> 13:02.781
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

13:02.781 --> 13:03.991
I'M TALKING ABOUT
SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.742
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE PEOP--
CHRIS, I'M TALKING

13:05.742 --> 13:07.744
ABOUT TABLES THAT TELL ME THAT
YOU TALK--

13:07.744 --> 13:10.789
AND I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT THE TABLES ARE TELLING ME.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.666
CHRIS, I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH YOU, BECAUSE--

13:12.666 --> 13:14.060
I'M NOT ARGUING
WITH YOU EITHER.

13:14.060 --> 13:14.251
I'M NOT ARGUING
WITH YOU EITHER.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.836
I KNOW WHAT I SAID, AND I NEVER
SAID NOTHING LIKE THAT.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.213
AND I KNOW WHAT
THE CUSTOMERS HAVE SAID TO ME.
LOTS.

13:18.213 --> 13:20.048
WELL, I DON'T--
I CAN'T DEAL

13:20.048 --> 13:21.175
<i>WITH WHAT PEOPLE</i>
<i>ARE TELLING YOU.</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:22.551
<i>I'M TELLING YOU WHAT I KNOW.</i>

13:22.551 --> 13:24.845
<i>ALL THE STUFF THAT'S WRONG</i>
<i>IN THIS PLACE,</i>

13:24.845 --> 13:27.389
I COULD'VE WENT ON FOR DAYS
ABOUT THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON,

13:27.389 --> 13:29.057
BUT I DIDN'T.
I'M TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.

13:29.057 --> 13:30.184
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.602
I'M TRYING TO PUT YOU
IN A PLACE

13:31.602 --> 13:33.812
<i>WHERE ALL OF US CAN MAKE</i>
<i>A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY,</i>

13:33.812 --> 13:36.648
AND IF SOMEBODY TOOK THAT
AS ME BEING RUDE TO JULIE,

13:36.648 --> 13:38.859
HEY, MAN, THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.777
<i>YOU CRAZY.</i>

13:40.777 --> 13:42.696
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS AROUND HERE?

13:42.696 --> 13:44.060
IT'S BLARING.
IT'S GOT STARS ALL AROUND IT.

13:44.060 --> 13:46.575
IT'S BLARING.
IT'S GOT STARS ALL AROUND IT.

13:47.951 --> 13:50.204
<i>JULIE, THERE SEEMS TO BE</i>
<i>AN AIR OF DISCOMFORT</i>

13:50.204 --> 13:52.915
WITH YOU AROUND THE CUSTOMERS
AND THE STAFF.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.124
WHY ARE YOU SO AGITATED?

13:54.124 --> 13:58.003
I HAVE TO BE IN THE BACK
AND HELPING THE STAFF,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.380
<i>AND IT'S TOO STRESSFUL</i>
<i>TRYING TO DO BOTH.</i>

14:00.380 --> 14:02.257
<i>I JUST THINK YOU SHOULD</i>
<i>FOCUS MORE ON MANAGING.</i>

14:02.257 --> 14:06.428
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
FOCUSING ON WHAT YOU NEED TO--
RIGHT, I'M TOO SCAT--

14:06.428 --> 14:07.846
YEAH, YOU'RE TOO SCATTERED.
I'M TOO SCATTERED.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.181
<i>YEAH.</i>
ORGANIZATION.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.849
<i>YOU'RE RIGHT.</i>
I'M TOO SCATTERED.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.851
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK
WHAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE IS,

14:12.851 --> 14:14.060
YOU HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED
THE LIST OF IMPORTANCE

14:14.060 --> 14:14.228
YOU HAVEN'T PRIORITIZED
THE LIST OF IMPORTANCE

14:14.228 --> 14:16.021
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU NEED
TO ACCOMPLISH...
RIGHT.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.648
BECAUSE YOU SEEM
FAR TOO AGITATED

14:17.648 --> 14:19.233
AND WAY TOO ON EDGE.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.902
I AGREE, BUT SOME OF THE BLAME
IS MY STAFF.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.195
<i>THE WHOLE STAFF?</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:26.323
NO. THE MAJOR ISSUES
IN THE RESTAURANT ARE TREVOR.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.743
TREVOR IS CREATING A LOT
OF STRESS IN THE RESTAURANT

14:29.743 --> 14:31.495
BECAUSE HE HAS A BAD ATTITUDE.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.871
<i>HE DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.</i>

14:32.871 --> 14:34.414
<i>HE WANTS TO STAND</i>
<i>BEHIND THAT LINE</i>

14:34.414 --> 14:35.791
AND ONLY COOK HIS FOOD.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.418
I CANNOT SCHEDULE HIM
IN THE DAY,

14:38.418 --> 14:39.628
OR HE JUST WON'T SHOW UP.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.505
OKAY.
HE JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.423
HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN GOING ON FOR?

14:43.423 --> 14:44.060
IT'S GOTTEN REALLY BAD

14:44.060 --> 14:44.841
IT'S GOTTEN REALLY BAD

14:44.841 --> 14:47.844
IN THE LAST SIX,
EIGHT MONTHS, REALLY BAD.

14:47.844 --> 14:48.845
<i>SO HE'S CHECKED OUT?</i>

14:48.845 --> 14:51.431
YES. HE'S ABSOLUTELY
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME

14:51.431 --> 14:52.808
BECAUSE MY HANDS ARE TIED
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE

14:52.808 --> 14:54.309
ANYBODY ELSE
IN THE RESTAURANT.

14:54.309 --> 14:57.521
AND THE DAYS THAT HE DOESN'T
APPEAR, WHAT ARE THE EXCUSES?

14:57.521 --> 15:00.899
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN EXCUSE.
HE JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.985
<i>TREVOR, YOUR SIDE--</i>
<i>WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

15:02.985 --> 15:04.861
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP?

15:04.861 --> 15:06.863
I HAD THOSE DAYS, YES.

15:06.863 --> 15:08.448
SOME DAYS ARE BETTER
THAN OTHERS.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.742
<i>NOT ONLY ARE YOU IN</i>
<i>WAY OVER YOUR HEAD,</i>

15:10.742 --> 15:11.910
BUT YOU'RE
OUT OF YOUR DEPTH.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.370
YES, CHEF.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.060
<i>ONE MISTAKE HAPPENS, AND YOU</i>
<i>GET ANGRY WITH EVERYBODY.</i>

15:14.060 --> 15:15.747
<i>ONE MISTAKE HAPPENS, AND YOU</i>
<i>GET ANGRY WITH EVERYBODY.</i>

15:15.747 --> 15:19.293
HOW LONG HAVE YOU FELT SO ANGRY
BEHIND THAT LINE?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.628
IT'S GROWN AND BUILT
OVER THIS PAST YEAR.

15:21.628 --> 15:23.088
WHY'D YOU COME IN
WITH THAT ATTITUDE?

15:23.088 --> 15:26.383
I WAS IN OVER MY HEAD
AT THE TIME.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.926
MM-HMM.
I WAS IN MY OWN

15:27.926 --> 15:30.220
PERSONAL PROBLEMS...

15:30.220 --> 15:32.139
AND BROUGHT IT
INTO THE RESTAURANT.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.598
<i>MM-HMM.</i>

15:33.598 --> 15:36.893
AND THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM.
WHEN TREVOR GETS ANGRY

15:36.893 --> 15:39.104
RIGHT.
<i>AND HAS ONE OF HIS FITS,</i>

15:39.104 --> 15:41.523
IT HAPPENS IN THE RESTAURANT
WHILE WE'RE FULL.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.233
<i>ANDIE CALLS ME QUITE</i>
<i>A BIT AND SAYS,</i>

15:43.233 --> 15:44.060
"TREVOR'S REFUSING TO COOK.

15:44.060 --> 15:44.901
"TREVOR'S REFUSING TO COOK.

15:44.901 --> 15:46.903
<i>"HE'S OUT BACK SMOKING.</i>
<i>THERE'S TICKETS ON THE LINE.</i>

15:46.903 --> 15:47.904
YOU NEED TO COME
TO THE RESTAURANT."

15:47.904 --> 15:49.031
<i>RIGHT.</i>
"BECAUSE HE'S ACTING

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
LIKE AN ASS AND SAYING,
'I WON'T COOK.'"

15:51.158 --> 15:53.660
AND NONE OF THIS IS BROUGHT
TO MY ATTENTION AT THE TIME.

15:53.660 --> 15:55.454
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIX
SOMETHING IF IT'S--

15:55.454 --> 15:57.080
BECAUSE WE'RE SCARED OF YOU,
TREVOR.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.373
I'M SCARED OF YOU.

15:58.373 --> 16:02.294
RIGHT, WHEN YOU WENT
FOR JANELLE PERSONALLY,

16:02.294 --> 16:05.589
WHY DOES THE JOB TAKE YOU
THAT FAR IN THE UNKNOWN?

16:05.589 --> 16:06.840
THAT DAY--
YOU GET THAT ANGRY

16:06.840 --> 16:07.966
THAT YOU WANT
TO PUNCH HER?

16:07.966 --> 16:10.802
THAT DAY, WE HAD A NEW COOK,
KIND OF LIPPED OFF TO ME,

16:10.802 --> 16:12.763
AND I WAS SAYING STUFF
UNDER MY BREATH,

16:12.763 --> 16:14.060
AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE,
SHE COMES TO THE BACK AND YELLS,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.432
AND THEN OUT OF NOWHERE,
SHE COMES TO THE BACK AND YELLS,

16:15.432 --> 16:17.642
<i>"NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU.</i>
<i>NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR LIFE."</i>

16:17.642 --> 16:20.729
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE THROWING
THINGS AT THE WALL.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.314
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.067
I HAVE TABLES, TREVOR.
I HAD TABLES SAYING,

16:25.067 --> 16:26.735
"THAT GUY IS HIGH.
THAT GUY--

16:26.735 --> 16:28.612
I'M SCARED TO BE IN HERE
RIGHT NOW."

16:28.612 --> 16:31.323
YOU WERE YELLING ABOUT MY MOM,
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS A BITCH.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.408
SHE IS MY MOTHER.
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE THAT.

16:33.408 --> 16:35.369
<i>SHE IS MY MOTHER. HOW WOULD YOU</i>
<i>LIKE IT IF SOMEONE TALKED</i>

16:35.369 --> 16:36.703
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER LIKE THAT?

16:36.703 --> 16:38.705
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF SOMEONE CALLED YOUR MOM

16:38.705 --> 16:40.457
A BITCH AND STUPID
AND WORTHLESS?

16:40.457 --> 16:41.917
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

16:41.917 --> 16:43.418
I DON'T WORK WITH MY MOM.
I DON'T HAVE

16:43.418 --> 16:44.060
THOSE KIND OF PROBLEMS.
<i>WELL, BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE--</i>

16:44.060 --> 16:44.503
THOSE KIND OF PROBLEMS.
<i>WELL, BUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE--</i>

16:44.503 --> 16:46.213
SHE IS MY MOM!
I KNOW SHE'S IS.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.214
<i>SHE IS MY MOM.</i>

16:47.214 --> 16:48.590
AND I HAVE RESPECT FOR HER.

16:48.590 --> 16:50.884
NO, YOU DO NOT.
YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR HER.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.469
I DON'T HAVE RESPECT FOR YOU.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.638
I DON'T HAVE RESPECT
FOR YOU EITHER.

17:03.688 --> 17:06.357
THERE IS NO QUESTION
THAT MANGIA MANGIA

17:06.357 --> 17:08.276
HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS
WITH THE FOOD,

17:08.276 --> 17:10.570
BUT THE INTERPERSONAL PROBLEMS
OF THIS RESTAURANT

17:10.570 --> 17:13.156
IS CHEF RAMSAY'S BIGGEST HURDLE
TO OVERCOME.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.742
WE'RE SCARED OF YOU, TREVOR.
I'M SCARED OF YOU.

17:15.742 --> 17:18.745
AND THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN JULIE'S DAUGHTER JANELLE

17:18.745 --> 17:22.165
AND CHEF TREVOR
MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.584
YOU WERE THROWING THINGS
AT THE WALL.

17:24.584 --> 17:25.877
IT DOESN'T INVOLVE YOU.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.045
I HAD TABLES SAYING,
"THAT GUY IS HIGH.

17:28.045 --> 17:30.061
THAT GUY--I'M SCARED
TO BE IN HERE RIGHT NOW."

17:30.061 --> 17:31.841
THAT GUY--I'M SCARED
TO BE IN HERE RIGHT NOW."

17:31.841 --> 17:34.302
SO, JANELLE, COULD THE CUSTOMERS
HEAR HIM THROWING THINGS AG--

17:34.302 --> 17:37.972
YES, HE WAS YELLING AND SLAMMING
AND SLAMMING POTS.

17:37.972 --> 17:40.475
<i>HE WAS THROWING KNIVES</i>
<i>AGAINST THE CUTTING BOARDS.</i>

17:40.475 --> 17:42.143
WERE YOU SCARED?
<i>YEAH, I WAS SCARED,</i>

17:42.143 --> 17:44.437
AND MY TABLE WAS SCARED TOO.

17:44.437 --> 17:46.314
<i>HERE WE ARE WITH A BUSINESS</i>

17:46.314 --> 17:48.524
LOSING THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS A WEEK,

17:48.524 --> 17:51.611
AND YOU START SHOUTING
AND SCREAMING IN THE KITCHEN,

17:51.611 --> 17:54.739
PETRIFYING THE CUSTOMERS,
PETRIFYING THE OWNER'S DAUGHTER.

17:54.739 --> 17:55.823
WERE YOU HIGH?

18:10.838 --> 18:14.383
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT..

18:14.383 --> 18:16.552
JULIE.

18:16.552 --> 18:19.263
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

18:19.263 --> 18:22.141
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HE WAS HIGH THAT DAY.

18:22.141 --> 18:26.229
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WAS
MAYBE ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS,

18:26.229 --> 18:28.397
<i>AND I TALKED TO HIM</i>
<i>ABOUT HIS DRUG USE</i>

18:28.397 --> 18:30.061
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,
AND HE SAID, "I'M DONE.

18:30.061 --> 18:30.942
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,
AND HE SAID, "I'M DONE.

18:30.942 --> 18:33.820
<i>I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN."</i>
<i>HE PROMISED FOR ME.</i>

18:33.820 --> 18:36.948
OBVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
ENOUGH ABOUT DRUGS.

18:36.948 --> 18:39.992
AND HOW LONG HAS THIS
BEEN LIKE THIS?

18:39.992 --> 18:42.328
A GOOD TIME.

18:42.328 --> 18:43.788
12 MONTHS?

18:43.788 --> 18:45.832
LONGER THAN THAT.

18:45.832 --> 18:47.667
<i>AND WHAT'S THE SUBSTANCE?</i>

18:47.667 --> 18:49.085
I DIDN'T KNOW.

18:49.085 --> 18:51.671
UH, IT'S AMPHETAMINES.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.714
<i>SO IT'S SERIOUS STUFF?</i>

18:56.008 --> 18:57.844
ARE YOU ATTENDING MEETINGS?

18:57.844 --> 19:00.061
NO, SIR.
<i>YOU'RE NOT?</i>

19:00.061 --> 19:00.471
NO, SIR.
<i>YOU'RE NOT?</i>

19:01.848 --> 19:02.932
THIS IS NOT ABOUT A CHEF

19:02.932 --> 19:05.143
AND THE OWNER'S DAUGHTER
FALLING OUT.

19:05.143 --> 19:07.770
THIS IS TOXIC.

19:07.770 --> 19:10.773
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR,
SOMEONE TO GET HURT?

19:10.773 --> 19:13.192
IT'S--IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOME
CHANGES IN THIS RESTAURANT...

19:13.192 --> 19:14.777
<i>NOW.</i>
AND I'M READY.

19:14.777 --> 19:16.737
TREVOR, THIS IS NOT WORKING
FOR ME ANYMORE.

19:16.737 --> 19:19.866
I HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION
WITH YOU ABOUT YOUR DRUG USE

19:19.866 --> 19:21.159
FOR TOO MANY TIMES.

19:21.159 --> 19:22.660
<i>IT'S BECOME POISON</i>
<i>IN THE RESTAURANT,</i>

19:22.660 --> 19:23.911
<i>AND I CAN'T DO THAT.</i>

19:23.911 --> 19:26.372
AND YOU'RE FIRED.

19:28.332 --> 19:29.917
I'M NOT DOING IT ANYMORE.

19:29.917 --> 19:30.061
<i>I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HAVE</i>
<i>THIS GOING ON.</i>

19:30.061 --> 19:32.420
<i>I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HAVE</i>
<i>THIS GOING ON.</i>

19:32.420 --> 19:33.754
<i>I RESPECT YOUR HONESTY,</i>

19:33.754 --> 19:36.632
BUT YOU CANNOT WALK IN HERE
UNDER THE INFLUENCE...

19:36.632 --> 19:38.176
I UNDERSTAND.

19:38.176 --> 19:42.805
ON YOUR DOWNWARD SPIRAL, START
TURNING THIS PLACE UPSIDE DOWN,

19:42.805 --> 19:46.767
AND YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T COOK
WHILST ON THAT.

19:46.767 --> 19:47.685
YOU NEED HELP.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.939
<i>LISTEN, EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM</i>
<i>HAS MADE MISTAKES,</i>

19:51.939 --> 19:53.900
<i>AND YOU'VE MADE</i>
<i>ONE OF THEM.</i>

19:53.900 --> 19:55.651
YES, CHEF.

19:55.651 --> 19:58.154
TREVOR, LET'S HAVE A WORD
OUTSIDE TOGETHER.

19:58.154 --> 19:59.405
YES, CHEF.

20:03.826 --> 20:06.495
WOW. THAT WAS TOUGH.

20:06.495 --> 20:09.624
<i>I TALKED TO HIM.</i>
<i>HE SAID, "I'M NOT DOING THAT."</i>

20:09.624 --> 20:11.709
I BELIEVED HIM, OBVIOUSLY.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.127
<i>I DIDN'T KNOW.</i>

20:13.127 --> 20:15.004
YOU NEED HELP, BUD.
I KNOW.

20:15.004 --> 20:18.216
AND YOU GOT TO GET
INTO TREATMENT QUICKLY.

20:18.216 --> 20:22.970
I WANT YOU TO GET YOURSELF HOME
AND GET YOURSELF TREATMENT.

20:22.970 --> 20:24.305
I WILL.

20:24.305 --> 20:26.140
OKAY, BUD.
TAKE CARE.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.059
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.685
IT'LL BE BETTER FOR HIM.

20:29.685 --> 20:30.061
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS DOING
DRUGS, AND I-I WOULD'VE--

20:30.061 --> 20:31.812
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS DOING
DRUGS, AND I-I WOULD'VE--

20:31.812 --> 20:33.606
<i>YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW.</i>

20:36.150 --> 20:39.153
I'M EMBARRASSED. I CAN'T BELIEVE
ANY OF THIS WENT ON.

20:39.153 --> 20:41.155
BUT I THINK HAVING TREVOR

20:41.155 --> 20:44.325
BEING SO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED
ON MY LINE

20:44.325 --> 20:46.494
AND ME EXPECTING HIM TO KNOW

20:46.494 --> 20:49.830
HOW TO MOVE THIS RESTAURANT
FORWARD, IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.374
I'M VERY NERVOUS
TO GO FORWARD.

20:51.374 --> 20:54.710
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FROM NOW.

20:54.710 --> 20:55.878
I JUST DON'T KNOW.

21:07.554 --> 21:08.805
AFTER LEARNING

21:08.805 --> 21:10.974
THAT MANGIA MANGIA'S
HEAD CHEF, TREVOR,

21:10.974 --> 21:14.728
HAS BEEN ABUSING DRUGS,
JULIE HAS DECIDED TO LET HIM GO.

21:14.728 --> 21:16.271
NOW CHEF RAMSAY
WANTS TO MAKE SURE

21:16.271 --> 21:19.399
THAT JULIE IS COMMITTED
TO MAKING BIG CHANGES

21:19.399 --> 21:22.444
TO PUTTING HER RESTAURANT
ON A PATH TO SUCCESS.

21:22.444 --> 21:25.322
<i>THE ATMOSPHERE IN HERE</i>
<i>IS DREADFUL.</i>

21:25.322 --> 21:28.492
EVERYBODY IS AT
SUCH A HIGH STRESS LEVEL.

21:28.492 --> 21:29.576
OKAY.

21:29.576 --> 21:30.786
BUT WITH REGARDS TO TREVOR--

21:30.786 --> 21:32.829
I DIDN'T KNOW.
<i>I UNDERSTAND.</i>

21:32.829 --> 21:34.096
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
WITH ADDICTS,

21:34.096 --> 21:34.956
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
WITH ADDICTS,

21:34.956 --> 21:36.917
AND HE IS IN A BAD PLACE
RIGHT NOW.

21:36.917 --> 21:39.169
HE IS NOT FIT TO BE A HEAD COOK
OR A SENIOR COOK

21:39.169 --> 21:41.171
OR A PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY.

21:41.171 --> 21:44.091
I KNEW THAT I NEEDED
TO LET TREVOR GO.

21:44.091 --> 21:45.926
I KNEW THAT HE WAS THE CANCER
IN THE RESTAURANT

21:45.926 --> 21:47.761
THAT WAS CAUSING
A LOT OF BAD ATTITUDES.
<i>YEAH.</i>

21:47.761 --> 21:49.846
OKAY, I RESPECT
YOUR DECISION,

21:49.846 --> 21:53.058
BUT I WOULD SERIOUSLY LIKE YOU
TO CONSIDER,

21:53.058 --> 21:55.560
DOWN THE ROAD,
IF HE GETS HIS ACT TOGETHER,

21:55.560 --> 21:57.521
JUST KEEPING THAT DOOR OPEN.
I WILL.

21:57.521 --> 21:59.356
HE NEEDS TO STEP UP
AND GET CLEAN.

21:59.356 --> 22:00.941
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

22:00.941 --> 22:02.401
BUT HERE'S THE THING--

22:02.401 --> 22:04.096
I NEED TO KNOW NOW THAT YOU,
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

22:04.096 --> 22:06.905
I NEED TO KNOW NOW THAT YOU,
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

22:06.905 --> 22:08.490
ARE SERIOUSLY COMMITTED
TO CHANGE.

22:08.490 --> 22:10.659
I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED
TO CHANGE,

22:10.659 --> 22:12.244
ABSOLUTELY 100%.

22:12.244 --> 22:13.787
YOU NEED TO HAVE
A BETTER VISION,

22:13.787 --> 22:15.163
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO FRAGMENTED.

22:15.163 --> 22:16.206
I AGREE.

22:16.206 --> 22:17.791
AND YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED
ON ANYTHING.

22:17.791 --> 22:19.418
IT'S NOT THE WAY
TO RUN A BUSINESS.

22:19.418 --> 22:20.502
I'M TOO SPREAD OUT.

22:20.502 --> 22:25.090
YOU WEREN'T EVEN COOKING
YOUR FOOD.

22:25.090 --> 22:26.800
NO.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.302
WE'VE GOT TO CHANGE THE FOOD.
THE FOOD HAS GOT TO BE CHANGED.

22:29.302 --> 22:31.054
<i>GOOD.</i>.

22:31.054 --> 22:33.390
WHAT OTHER THINGS
DID YOU THINK ABOUT

22:33.390 --> 22:34.096
THAT YOU WANT TO CHANGE?

22:34.096 --> 22:35.767
THAT YOU WANT TO CHANGE?

22:35.767 --> 22:38.061
I NEED TO QUIT
WAITING TABLES,

22:38.061 --> 22:40.439
AND I NEED TO HAVE BETTER
COMMUNICATION WITH MY STAFF.

22:40.439 --> 22:42.149
THAT'S A HUGE COMMITMENT...
IT IS.

22:42.149 --> 22:43.316
DOING WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
I CAN DO IT.

22:43.316 --> 22:44.276
EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IS--
I CAN DO THIS.

22:44.276 --> 22:46.236
IT'S TRUE.
IT'S TRUE.

22:46.236 --> 22:48.488
I AGREE.
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.

22:48.488 --> 22:50.198
WE'VE GOT A GAP TO FILL
IN THE KITCHEN.

22:50.198 --> 22:53.201
YES, WE DO,
AND I'M TERRIFIED.

22:53.201 --> 22:56.329
THIS PLACE NEEDS A CHEF
THAT CAN HELP RUN THIS BUSINESS

22:56.329 --> 22:58.957
FROM THE ENGINE ROOM
AND TO GET THE BUSINESS AFLOAT

22:58.957 --> 23:00.459
AND UP AND RUNNING
AND MAKING MORE MONEY.

23:00.459 --> 23:03.795
NO, I-I--NO, I AGREE.
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH YOU.

23:03.795 --> 23:04.096
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME CALLS,
AND I'M GONNA GET HELP.

23:04.096 --> 23:06.423
I'M GONNA MAKE SOME CALLS,
AND I'M GONNA GET HELP.

23:06.423 --> 23:08.383
OKAY. I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU.

23:10.385 --> 23:13.555
IT'S TIME TO MAKE SOME SERIOUS
CHANGES IN THIS RESTAURANT.

23:13.555 --> 23:15.307
I KNOW I'VE BEEN
PART OF THE PROBLEM,

23:15.307 --> 23:17.350
BUT I'M READY TO GO FORWARD

23:17.350 --> 23:20.395
AND MAKE THIS RESTAURANT
SUCCESSFUL.

23:20.395 --> 23:22.564
NOW THAT JULIE UNDERSTANDS
THE NECESSITY

23:22.564 --> 23:24.441
OF DRAMATIC CHANGES
TO THE RESTAURANT,

23:24.441 --> 23:26.109
CHEF RAMSAY
WANTS TO SHOW JULIE

23:26.109 --> 23:29.362
THE IMPACT AND IMPORTANCE
OF FRESH INGREDIENTS.

23:29.362 --> 23:30.489
<i>I'M GONNA COOK,</i>
<i>YOU'RE GONNA WATCH.</i>

23:30.489 --> 23:31.490
OKAY.

23:31.490 --> 23:32.949
THERE ARE TWO DISHES
WE'RE GONNA MAKE--

23:32.949 --> 23:34.096
A SIMPLE LASAGNA
AND A SIMPLE ROAST SALMON.

23:34.096 --> 23:34.784
A SIMPLE LASAGNA
AND A SIMPLE ROAST SALMON.

23:34.784 --> 23:37.454
HAVE YOU EVER FUNCTIONED THIS
RESTAURANT WITHOUT A MICROWAVE?

23:37.454 --> 23:39.039
NO.
WOW.

23:39.039 --> 23:40.665
AND HOW MANY RESTAURANTS
DO YOU THINK

23:40.665 --> 23:43.210
FUNCTION MORE WITH A MICROWAVE
THAN THEY DO WITH THEIR OVENS?

23:43.210 --> 23:44.669
THAT I DON'T KNOW.
NO.

23:44.669 --> 23:46.254
NOT MANY AT ALL.
THAT'S ALL CHANGING AS WELL.

23:46.254 --> 23:47.714
OKAY.

23:47.714 --> 23:49.341
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR CHEF RAMSAY TO SHOW ME

23:49.341 --> 23:51.259
HOW A REAL, TRUE KITCHEN
IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUN.

23:51.259 --> 23:53.094
HE'S GONNA TEACH ME
HOW TO COOK

23:53.094 --> 23:54.513
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT
ALL WRONG.

23:54.513 --> 23:56.932
SO THE EXCITING THING
ABOUT LASAGNA IS IN THE LAYERS--

23:56.932 --> 23:59.476
TOMATO, MEAT SAUCE,
MOZZARELLA, PASTA.

23:59.476 --> 24:00.477
HOW DIFFICULT WAS THAT?

24:00.477 --> 24:01.561
LOOKS PRETTY EASY.
TOOK FIVE MINUTES.

24:01.561 --> 24:03.146
PRETTY EASY.
OKAY.

24:03.146 --> 24:04.096
WHAT DO YOU DISLIKE ABOUT BEING
IN THE KITCHEN THE MOST?

24:04.096 --> 24:05.315
WHAT DO YOU DISLIKE ABOUT BEING
IN THE KITCHEN THE MOST?

24:05.315 --> 24:06.942
<i>THE STRESS OF BEING</i>
<i>BEHIND THE LINE.</i>

24:06.942 --> 24:09.611
WHEN YOU'VE GOT A GREAT PREP AND
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF ORGANIZED,

24:09.611 --> 24:10.946
IT BECOMES
THE MOST PLEASURABLE

24:10.946 --> 24:12.989
AND THE MOST DE-STRESSFUL THING
YOU CAN EVER DO.

24:12.989 --> 24:14.407
LITTLE SALT,
LITTLE PEPPER.

24:14.407 --> 24:16.326
NOW, INTO THE MICROWAVE
FOR FOUR MINUTES--

24:16.326 --> 24:17.953
OFF.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

24:19.412 --> 24:21.206
YOU'RE GOOD AT TAKING ORDERS,
BUT YOU'VE GOT A BAKE. USE IT.

24:21.206 --> 24:22.916
OKAY, OPEN THE FRIDGE
AND TAKE THAT OUT, PLEASE.

24:22.916 --> 24:24.834
WHAT IS THAT?
SALMON.

24:24.834 --> 24:25.961
YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "SALMON"?

24:25.961 --> 24:26.962
FRESH SALMON.

24:26.962 --> 24:28.296
HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S FRESH?

24:28.296 --> 24:29.256
BECAUSE I CAN TELL
BY THE LOOK OF IT,

24:29.256 --> 24:30.840
IT'S GOT
THAT DARK PINK COLOR.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.801
RIGHT.
HOW'D YOU COOK SALMON?

24:32.801 --> 24:34.096
THEY COOK IT
ON THE FLAT TOP.
ON THE GRILL.

24:34.096 --> 24:34.970
THEY COOK IT
ON THE FLAT TOP.
ON THE GRILL.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.138
NOW, COOKING SALMON THIS WAY
IS A LOT EASIER

24:37.138 --> 24:38.974
THAN IT IS
ON THAT SOLID TOP.

24:38.974 --> 24:40.517
ONCE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD COLOR
IN SALMON,

24:40.517 --> 24:42.143
TURN IT OVER ONCE.

24:42.143 --> 24:44.896
WOW. THAT LOOKS
SO MUCH BETTER.

24:44.896 --> 24:46.565
THE PRACTICE YOU WERE DOING
BEFOREHAND

24:46.565 --> 24:47.732
WAS SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

24:47.732 --> 24:49.401
YOU CAN DO
ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL DISHES

24:49.401 --> 24:51.611
SO EASY, IN A SHORT AMOUNT
OF TIME, AND MAKE 'EM FRESH.

24:51.611 --> 24:54.573
WE ARE DONE WITH MICROWAVES.
WE ARE DONE WITH FROZEN FOOD.

24:54.573 --> 24:56.449
I AM BUYING EVERYTHING FRESH.

24:56.449 --> 25:00.036
THIS IS JUST A SMALL SAMPLE
OF HOW EXCITING

25:00.036 --> 25:02.747
YOUR ITALIAN FARE COULD BE, AND
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY RESTAURANT

25:02.747 --> 25:04.096
WITHIN A 15- TO 20-MILE RADIUS
SERVING FOOD LIKE THIS,

25:04.096 --> 25:05.542
WITHIN A 15- TO 20-MILE RADIUS
SERVING FOOD LIKE THIS,

25:05.542 --> 25:09.212
TRUST ME--THERE SHOULD BE
A QUEUE UP OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

25:09.212 --> 25:11.923
WE ARE RELAUNCHING
THIS RESTAURANT TOMORROW,

25:11.923 --> 25:14.134
AND WE ALL HAVE TO WORK
AS HARD AS WE EVER HAVE

25:14.134 --> 25:16.344
<i>TO REPOSITION</i>
<i>THIS RESTAURANT.</i>
YES.

25:16.344 --> 25:18.930
I KNOW YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT
AND THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING,

25:18.930 --> 25:20.265
DON'T CRY.
BUT--

25:20.265 --> 25:21.641
I KNOW.
I'M JUST STRESSED.

25:21.641 --> 25:23.101
WHAT ARE YOU
STRESSED ABOUT?

25:23.101 --> 25:25.312
JUST THE--THIS, ALL OF IT.
IT'S STRESSFUL.

25:25.312 --> 25:29.774
HAVING THAT ANXIETY IS NORMAL.
BOTTLING IT UP IS NOT.

25:29.774 --> 25:32.027
YEAH, I'VE HELD IT IN
FOR A LONG TIME.

25:32.027 --> 25:33.695
I CAN SEE THAT.

25:33.695 --> 25:34.096
WE HAVE YOUR BACK,
WE'VE GOT YOU.
I KNOW.

25:34.096 --> 25:35.614
WE HAVE YOUR BACK,
WE'VE GOT YOU.
I KNOW.

25:35.614 --> 25:37.282
NOW YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE A TEAMMATE.

25:37.282 --> 25:38.742
NOW YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE THE WAY

25:38.742 --> 25:40.327
YOU SHOULD BE SUPPORTING
AN OWNER.

25:40.327 --> 25:42.329
GOOD.
NOW THAT TREVOR'S GONE,

25:42.329 --> 25:44.914
I DID MAKE SOME CALLS,
AND I HAVE FOUND A CHEF, OKAY?

25:44.914 --> 25:46.374
OH, THANK GOD.

25:46.374 --> 25:48.418
SOMEONE TO LEAD
YOUR KITCHEN.

25:48.418 --> 25:51.671
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET DON WOLF.
HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY?

25:51.671 --> 25:53.048
- YOU GOOD?
<i>- YEAH, I'M GREAT.</i>

25:53.048 --> 25:54.633
FIRST OF ALL, LOOK AT THAT SMILE
ON THAT FACE.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.260
<i>COLORADO BOY, LOCAL BOY.</i>

25:57.260 --> 25:58.303
OH.

25:58.303 --> 25:59.304
YEAH, IN DENVER.

25:59.304 --> 26:00.305
<i>OH, COOL.</i>

26:00.305 --> 26:01.306
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

26:01.306 --> 26:03.433
HE RAN AS AN EXECUTIVE
SOUS CHEF

26:03.433 --> 26:04.096
AT A VERY REPUTABLE
ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN DENVER.

26:04.096 --> 26:05.644
AT A VERY REPUTABLE
ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN DENVER.

26:05.644 --> 26:08.938
<i>HE HAS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA</i>
<i>OF KNOWLEDGE</i>

26:08.938 --> 26:10.315
<i>IN CONJUNCTION</i>
<i>WITH ITALIAN CUISINE.</i>

26:10.315 --> 26:12.942
I'VE ARRANGED FOR HIM TO STAY
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS,

26:12.942 --> 26:14.486
<i>AND SECURE A NEW CHEF</i>
<i>COMING IN.</i>

26:14.486 --> 26:15.487
OKAY.

26:15.487 --> 26:16.488
LISTEN TO THIS GUY.

26:16.488 --> 26:17.572
I PLAN ON IT.

26:17.572 --> 26:20.075
HE'S GONNA TEACH YOU
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

26:20.075 --> 26:21.326
<i>ABSORB IT LIKE A SPONGE.</i>

26:21.326 --> 26:23.286
IT'S MY PLEASURE.
I'M READY.

26:23.286 --> 26:24.704
GET TO KNOW YOUR NEW TEAM.
I WILL.

26:24.704 --> 26:26.039
HOW'S IT GOING?
I'M KEVIN.
PRETTY GOOD.

26:26.039 --> 26:26.998
KEVIN?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:26.998 --> 26:28.541
GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN.

26:28.541 --> 26:31.753
COOKING IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT
STORY FOR ME NOW.

26:31.753 --> 26:34.096
WE USED TO COOK WITH MICROWAVES.
NOW WE COOK WITH OVENS.

26:34.096 --> 26:35.256
WE USED TO COOK WITH MICROWAVES.
NOW WE COOK WITH OVENS.

26:35.256 --> 26:37.717
I'M GONNA GRASP
AS MUCH AS I CAN RIGHT NOW

26:37.717 --> 26:39.219
AND LEARN FROM CHEF DON.

26:39.219 --> 26:40.428
WE'RE GONNA LEARN
EVERYTHING...

26:40.428 --> 26:42.263
OH, GOOD.
AND IT'S SIMPLE,

26:42.263 --> 26:43.390
AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

26:43.390 --> 26:45.392
IT IS SO AMAZING
THAT CHEF RAMSAY

26:45.392 --> 26:47.644
GOT THIS NEW CHEF FOR ME,
AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:47.644 --> 26:48.812
I'M OVER THE MOON.

26:48.812 --> 26:51.773
MMM.
THAT'S GOOD.

26:51.773 --> 26:55.276
COMING UP, CHEF RAMSAY
RE-LAUNCHES MANGIA MANGIA.

26:55.276 --> 26:57.195
WE'RE COOKING FOOD NOW,
NOT REHEATING IT.

26:57.195 --> 26:59.572
WILL JULIE BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THE NUMEROUS CHANGES?

26:59.572 --> 27:02.242
WE'RE JUST STRAIGHT, EVERYBODY
OFF, RUSHING, RUSHING, RUSHING.

27:02.242 --> 27:03.952
IT'S NEW, IT'S NEW.

27:03.952 --> 27:04.096
OR WILL A CRITICAL MISTAKE
RUIN THE RESTAURANT'S COMEBACK?

27:04.096 --> 27:06.329
OR WILL A CRITICAL MISTAKE
RUIN THE RESTAURANT'S COMEBACK?

27:06.329 --> 27:07.789
SO NOW, YOU'VE JUST
COMPLETELY SCREWED US.

27:15.254 --> 27:16.672
CONFIDENT
IN THE DRAMATIC CHANGES

27:16.672 --> 27:19.091
THAT ARE COMING
FOR MANGIA MANGIA,

27:19.091 --> 27:21.468
CHEF RAMSAY HAS SURPRISED
JULIE AND THE STAFF...

27:21.468 --> 27:22.553
LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO.

27:22.553 --> 27:23.637
WITH A COMMUNITY EVENT

27:25.389 --> 27:28.016
TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
TO RETURN TO THE RESTAURANT.

27:38.318 --> 27:39.862
<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME.</i>

27:39.862 --> 27:42.072
I AM SO GRATEFUL
FOR YOU ALL TO BE HERE.

27:42.072 --> 27:42.089
<i>WE ARE MAKING</i>
<i>DRAMATIC CHANGES</i>

27:42.089 --> 27:44.616
<i>WE ARE MAKING</i>
<i>DRAMATIC CHANGES</i>

27:44.616 --> 27:46.702
TO YOUR LOCAL
ITALIAN RESTAURANT,

27:46.702 --> 27:48.203
AND I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE GONNA LOVE THEM.

27:48.203 --> 27:50.539
HI, MY NAME'S JULIE.
I OWN MANGIA MANGIA.

27:50.539 --> 27:52.749
I AM SO EXCITED
TO SEE YOU ALL HERE.

27:52.749 --> 27:54.751
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

27:59.214 --> 28:01.508
THE WHOLE TOWN'S HERE.
IT'S A GREAT FEELING

28:01.508 --> 28:03.135
THAT THEY'RE HERE
TO SUPPORT US.

28:03.135 --> 28:04.136
WHOA!

28:09.057 --> 28:10.684
IN ADDITION TO THE ACTIVITIES...

28:10.684 --> 28:12.089
WHOA!

28:12.089 --> 28:12.227
WHOA!

28:12.227 --> 28:13.645
AND THE SAMPLING
OF SOME MENU ITEMS...

28:13.645 --> 28:15.606
VERY GOOD.
MMM.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.691
CHEF RAMSAY HAS INVITED
LOCAL DIGNITARIES...

28:17.691 --> 28:19.276
ARE WE READY?

28:19.276 --> 28:21.570
TO PARTICIPATE
IN A PASTA EATING CONTEST.

28:21.570 --> 28:24.239
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!

28:29.077 --> 28:32.206
IT WAS AMAZING.
THE CROWD WAS ALL HAPPY FOR US.

28:32.206 --> 28:33.624
EVERYBODY SEEING THIS?

28:35.125 --> 28:40.047
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE!

28:40.047 --> 28:41.798
STOP!

28:41.798 --> 28:42.089
<i>NOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALIZING</i>
<i>THAT WE'RE TRYING</i>

28:42.089 --> 28:43.800
<i>NOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY REALIZING</i>
<i>THAT WE'RE TRYING</i>

28:43.800 --> 28:46.094
TO CHANGE THINGS,
AND THEY'RE SUPPORTING IT.

28:50.807 --> 28:52.142
FRESH BRUSCHETTA RIGHT HERE,
YEAH.

28:52.142 --> 28:53.352
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

28:53.352 --> 28:55.854
EXCELLENT.
IT IS SO DELICIOUS, I LOVE IT.

28:55.854 --> 28:57.022
IT'S GREAT FLAVOR.

28:57.022 --> 28:58.023
THANKS FOR COMING.

28:58.023 --> 28:59.316
THANK YOU.
THANKS.

28:59.316 --> 29:01.068
I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
TO MANGIA MANGIA

29:01.068 --> 29:02.361
AND TRY THE NEW MENU.

29:02.361 --> 29:04.571
IT LOOKS MUCH BETTER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

29:04.571 --> 29:05.697
THIS IS WONDERFUL.
OH, THANK YOU!

29:05.697 --> 29:06.698
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME
TO YOUR RESTAURANT.

29:06.698 --> 29:08.200
OH, PLEASE COME.

29:08.200 --> 29:10.619
EVERYBODY IS SAYING THEY LOVE
THE FOOD, I AM SO EXCITED.

29:10.619 --> 29:12.089
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO PROVE TO EVERYBODY

29:12.089 --> 29:12.746
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO PROVE TO EVERYBODY

29:12.746 --> 29:14.581
THAT MANGIA MANGIA IS BACK.

29:18.252 --> 29:21.296
WHILE A BIG PART OF YESTERDAY
WAS SPENT SPREADING THE WORD

29:21.296 --> 29:23.548
ABOUT THE NEW MANGIA MANGIA,

29:23.548 --> 29:26.051
LAST NIGHT, CHEF RAMSAY'S TEAM
WORKED AROUND THE CLOCK

29:26.051 --> 29:28.178
AND MADE
A MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION

29:28.178 --> 29:31.598
TO THE DINING ROOM.

29:36.603 --> 29:38.647
ARE YOU READY TO SEE
THE NEW MANGIA MANGIA?

29:38.647 --> 29:39.898
YES.
YES.

29:39.898 --> 29:41.566
<i>WELCOME TO THE NEW</i>
<i>MANGIA MANGIA.</i>

29:41.566 --> 29:42.089

29:42.089 --> 29:42.567
ALL RIGHT.

29:42.567 --> 29:44.486
OH, MY GOSH.

29:44.486 --> 29:45.487
<i>JUMP IN.</i>

29:45.487 --> 29:46.780
<i>OH, WOW.</i>

29:46.780 --> 29:48.573
LOOK AT THE WALL, OH, MY GOSH.
OH, MY GOSH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

29:52.577 --> 29:53.954
OH, MY G--
NO WAY.

29:53.954 --> 29:55.163
- OH, NO.
<i>- JUMP ON IN.</i>

29:55.163 --> 29:56.164
<i>WOW.</i>

29:56.164 --> 29:58.000
IT LOOKS STUNNING.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.001
IT IS, OH... WOW.

29:59.001 --> 30:00.544
<i>RIGHT.</i>

30:00.544 --> 30:02.754
WELCOME
TO YOUR NEW RESTAURANT.

30:02.754 --> 30:04.339
WOW, I'M STUNNED.

30:04.339 --> 30:06.758
<i>GONE IS THAT BLAND,</i>
<i>BEIGE COLOR</i>

30:06.758 --> 30:09.720
<i>AND IN ITS PLACE,</i>
<i>A SPRUCE, VIBRANT GREEN.</i>

30:09.720 --> 30:11.305
<i>WOW.</i>

30:11.305 --> 30:12.089
<i>COOL.</i>

30:12.089 --> 30:12.306
<i>COOL.</i>

30:12.306 --> 30:13.682
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:13.682 --> 30:16.727
<i>GONE ARE THOSE DREADFUL,</i>
<i>DREARY BOOTHS.</i>

30:16.727 --> 30:18.353
<i>WE'VE REPLACED ALL THE SEATING</i>

30:18.353 --> 30:19.688
<i>WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL</i>
<i>WOODEN CHAIRS,</i>

30:19.688 --> 30:21.690
<i>WHICH DRAMATICALLY OPENS UP</i>
<i>THIS BEAUTIFUL ROOM.</i>

30:21.690 --> 30:23.108
<i>WOW.</i>

30:23.108 --> 30:25.569
I LOVE THE CHAIRS.
OH, MY GOSH, THEY'RE GORGEOUS.

30:25.569 --> 30:26.862
IT'S AWESOME.
THIS IS AWESOME.

30:26.862 --> 30:28.739
AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
WITH THOSE BOOTHS GONE,

30:28.739 --> 30:31.658
THE FLOW OF SERVICE
SHOULD FUNCTION SO MUCH BETTER.

30:31.658 --> 30:33.785
WOW, I'M OVERWHELMED.

30:33.785 --> 30:35.787
IT'S A WARM, COMFORT FEELING
IN HERE RIGHT NOW.

30:35.787 --> 30:37.414
DOESN'T IT?
LOOK AT THE WALL.

30:37.414 --> 30:38.623
<i>BEFORE, IT WAS AN EYESORE.</i>

30:38.623 --> 30:41.501
<i>NOW THAT WE HAVE BEAUTIFULLY</i>
<i>MADE IT BLEND RIGHT IN.</i>

30:41.501 --> 30:42.089
<i>THIS IS GREAT.</i>

30:42.089 --> 30:42.502
<i>THIS IS GREAT.</i>

30:42.502 --> 30:43.587
<i>BREATHTAKING.</i>

30:43.587 --> 30:44.671
ISN'T IT BREATHTAKING?
IT REALLY IS.

30:44.671 --> 30:45.756
IT'S GORGEOUS.

30:45.756 --> 30:46.757
<i>LOOK AT THE WINDOWS,</i>

30:46.757 --> 30:48.050
<i>FULL LENGTH WOODEN BLINDS</i>

30:48.050 --> 30:49.926
<i>DRAPED WITH WONDERFUL</i>
<i>TAUPE CURTAINS.</i>

30:49.926 --> 30:52.596
<i>IT IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.</i>

30:52.596 --> 30:53.597
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

30:53.597 --> 30:55.474
AND LET'S BE HONEST,
IT DOES NOT LOOK

30:55.474 --> 30:57.559
ANYTHING LIKE A FAST FOOD
RESTAURANT, RIGHT?

30:57.559 --> 30:59.394
NO.
NO, NOT AT ALL.

30:59.394 --> 31:01.021
I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH.

31:01.021 --> 31:03.273
DID YOU STILL LIKE THE OLD DECOR
THAT YOU SAID WAS BEAUTIFUL?

31:03.273 --> 31:04.316
ONE OF THOSE--
NO, NO.

31:04.316 --> 31:05.692
THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER.

31:05.692 --> 31:06.860
YOU SURE?
YEAH, I'M SURE.

31:08.195 --> 31:10.113
I THOUGHT MY OLD RESTAURANT
REALLY LOOKED GOOD,

31:10.113 --> 31:12.089
BUT AFTER SEEING THIS,
I MUST'VE BEEN CRAZY.

31:12.089 --> 31:12.741
BUT AFTER SEEING THIS,
I MUST'VE BEEN CRAZY.

31:12.741 --> 31:15.285
I'M EXCITED.
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

31:15.285 --> 31:16.745
THE PLACE LOOKS
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

31:16.745 --> 31:19.414
IT'S INVITING,
FEELS LIKE WOODLAND PARK.

31:19.414 --> 31:21.708
PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANT TO COME
IN HERE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES.

31:21.708 --> 31:23.585
THE PICTURES ARE NICE.
THIS IS REALLY COOL TOO.

31:23.585 --> 31:24.544
I LIKE THIS.

31:24.544 --> 31:25.837
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE BEST PRESENT

31:25.837 --> 31:28.048
MY MOM'S EVER GOTTEN
IN HER ENTIRE LIFE.

31:28.048 --> 31:31.635
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
THAT HAPPY BEFORE.

31:31.635 --> 31:34.596
TO GO ALONG WITH THE COMPLETELY
REVAMPED DINING ROOM...

31:34.596 --> 31:37.099
PLEASE TAKE A COPY OF THE MENU
AND HAND IT DOWN.

31:37.099 --> 31:38.642
<i>WOW.</i>

31:38.642 --> 31:41.311
CHEF RAMSAY HAS DONE HIS MAGIC
TO THE MENU AS WELL

31:41.311 --> 31:42.089
WITH FRESH ITALIAN CUISINE

31:42.089 --> 31:42.729
WITH FRESH ITALIAN CUISINE

31:42.729 --> 31:45.524
THAT IS SURE TO BE A HIT
WITH THIS TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY.

31:45.524 --> 31:46.733
VISUALLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:46.733 --> 31:48.860
GORGEOUS.
ABSOLUTELY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

31:48.860 --> 31:50.779
IT SCREAMS "EAT ME," YEAH?

31:50.779 --> 31:52.447
ABSOLUTELY.

31:52.447 --> 31:53.615
<i>LET'S START OFF</i>
<i>WITH THE BRUSCHETTA.</i>

31:53.615 --> 31:55.367
<i>GREAT LITTLE BOARD</i>
<i>FOR SHARING.</i>

31:55.367 --> 31:57.327
<i>SO WHILST THE GUESTS</i>
<i>ARE UNDECIDED</i>

31:57.327 --> 31:58.412
<i>WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE HAVING,</i>

31:58.412 --> 31:59.663
HIT THE TABLE
WITH THE BRUSCHETTA.

31:59.663 --> 32:02.124
LIKEWISE WITH THE CHEF'S
ANTIPASTO MIXTURE

32:02.124 --> 32:04.835
<i>OF SALAMIS, MEAT, CHEESES,</i>
<i>AND SOME PICKLED VEGETABLES.</i>

32:04.835 --> 32:07.587
THOSE TWO SHOULD HIT THE TABLE
IMMEDIATELY.

32:07.587 --> 32:10.757
THE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS
COME WITH A RICH TOMATO SAUCE,

32:10.757 --> 32:12.089
FRESH BASIL,
AND SPICY DELICIOUS MEATBALLS.

32:12.089 --> 32:13.260
FRESH BASIL,
AND SPICY DELICIOUS MEATBALLS.

32:13.260 --> 32:14.636
MMM, YUM.
YUM.

32:14.636 --> 32:15.887
MANGIA MANGIA'S
VERY OWN LASAGNA.

32:15.887 --> 32:18.557
<i>LOOK AT THOSE LAYERS.</i>
<i>AND GUESS WHAT.</i>

32:18.557 --> 32:20.600
BREAKING NEWS.
IT'S COMING FROM THE OVEN.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.601
NOT THE MICROWAVE.

32:21.601 --> 32:22.602
NOT THE MICROWAVE.

32:22.602 --> 32:24.229
<i>YES!</i>

32:24.229 --> 32:25.230
<i>NEXT TO THAT,</i>
<i>ONE OF MY FAVORITES.</i>

32:25.230 --> 32:26.523
PAN-SEARED SALMON.
A BIG HIT.

32:26.523 --> 32:30.735
<i>SERVED WITH A NICE, FRAGRANT</i>
<i>LEMON RISOTTO. SIMPLE.</i>

32:30.735 --> 32:32.362
A CHOCOLATE MOLTEN LAVA CAKE.

32:32.362 --> 32:35.615
<i>DELICIOUS, CREAMY, RICH,</i>
<i>SUMPTUOUS IN THE MIDDLE.</i>

32:35.615 --> 32:37.242
CUT THROUGH,
IT JUST OOZES.

32:37.242 --> 32:38.493
THAT'S PERFECT.

32:38.493 --> 32:39.828
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
WHAT PERCENT

32:39.828 --> 32:40.871
OF THIS SMALL MENU'S FROZEN?

32:40.871 --> 32:42.089
WELL, I'M SURE NOTHING.

32:42.089 --> 32:42.414
WELL, I'M SURE NOTHING.

32:42.414 --> 32:43.582
<i>NOT A FROZEN INGREDIENT</i>
<i>ANYWHERE,</i>

32:43.582 --> 32:45.876
NOT A MICROWAVE "BING"
IN SIGHT.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.044
<i>YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE CHANGE.</i>

32:48.044 --> 32:49.629
EVERYTHING HERE IS FRESH.

32:49.629 --> 32:52.215
<i>NOW, TO GO ALONG</i>
<i>WITH YOUR STUNNING FOOD,</i>

32:52.215 --> 32:56.011
WE HAVE A COMPLETE NEW RANGE
OF FLATWARE AND DINNERWARE

32:56.011 --> 32:57.179
<i>PROVIDED BY ONEIDA.</i>

32:57.179 --> 32:59.347
<i>RIGHT, GET UP TO SPEED.</i>
<i>DIG IN.</i>

32:59.347 --> 33:00.891
MMM, THAT'S GOOD.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.559
ISN'T IT?
IT'S THAT SAUCE.

33:02.559 --> 33:05.061
I'M EXTREMELY EXCITED
TO COOK THIS NEW FOOD.

33:05.061 --> 33:07.397
LIKE, IT FEELS LIKE
I LEFT MANGIA

33:07.397 --> 33:09.524
AND WENT INTO
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KITCHEN.

33:09.524 --> 33:11.193
WOW.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

33:11.193 --> 33:12.089
IT'S SO GOOD.

33:12.089 --> 33:12.652
IT'S SO GOOD.

33:12.652 --> 33:15.030
TASTING THIS NEW FOOD,
COMPARED TO MY OLD FOOD,

33:15.030 --> 33:17.908
IT'S DAYLIGHT AND DARK.
THIS FOOD HAS GREAT FLAVOR.

33:17.908 --> 33:20.785
I NOW REALIZE
THAT MY OTHER FOOD WAS BLAND.

33:20.785 --> 33:22.496
THIS IS DELIGHTFUL.

33:22.496 --> 33:23.788
I CAN'T EVEN PUT A PLATE
IN THE MICROWAVE,

33:23.788 --> 33:24.789
<i>THEY DON'T EVEN FIT.</i>

33:26.041 --> 33:27.042
COMING UP...

33:27.042 --> 33:28.043
STOP.

33:28.043 --> 33:29.211
THE PRESSURE IS ON

33:29.211 --> 33:30.921
AS JULIE IS IN THE CENTER
OF THE ACTION.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.964
WE'RE COOKING FOOD NOW,
NOT REHEATING IT.

33:32.964 --> 33:35.217
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO ADAPT

33:35.217 --> 33:38.011
AND LEAD HER RESTAURANT
TO A SUCCESSFUL RE-LAUNCH...

33:38.011 --> 33:40.555
WE'RE JUST STRAIGHT, EVERYBODY
OFF, RUSHING, RUSHING, RUSHING.

33:40.555 --> 33:42.089
OR WILL SHE COLLAPSE AND
TAKE THE RESTAURANT WITH HER?

33:42.089 --> 33:43.683
OR WILL SHE COLLAPSE AND
TAKE THE RESTAURANT WITH HER?

33:43.683 --> 33:45.685
SO NOW, YOU'VE JUST
COMPLETELY SCREWED US.

33:54.193 --> 33:56.695
IT'S MINUTES
BEFORE THE DOORS OPEN...

33:56.695 --> 33:59.073
COME OVER GUYS, PLEASE. LET'S
GO TO THE DINING ROOM, SHALL WE?

33:59.073 --> 34:01.784
AND THE MORALE IN THE RESTAURANT
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

34:01.784 --> 34:03.619
THAN WHEN CHEF RAMSAY
FIRST ARRIVED.

34:03.619 --> 34:05.621
THE IMPORTANT THING TONIGHT
IS WHAT?

34:05.621 --> 34:07.831
GETTING THE FOOD OUT,
MAKING SURE IT ALL RUNS SMOOTH.

34:07.831 --> 34:09.541
COMMUNICATION.
YES.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.085
YOU DON'T SEND MISTAKES
OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

34:11.085 --> 34:13.545
WE'RE NOT GONNA EVEN ATTEMPT TO
SEND ANYTHING OUT SUBSTANDARD,

34:13.545 --> 34:14.922
AND HEY, GUESS WHAT?

34:14.922 --> 34:16.298
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE PUSHING
ANY NUMBERS TONIGHT.

34:16.298 --> 34:17.383
FOUR MINUTES, TWO MINUTES,

34:17.383 --> 34:18.550
COCKTAIL STICKS.
YOU'LL BE COOKING.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.152
COVERING WITH SARAN WRAP.

34:19.152 --> 34:19.551
COVERING WITH SARAN WRAP.

34:19.551 --> 34:20.552
YEAH.

34:20.552 --> 34:21.762
AND JUST WATCH YOUR SLEEVES.

34:21.762 --> 34:22.971
IT'S A REAL OVEN,
SO IT'S HOT IN THERE.

34:22.971 --> 34:23.972
<i>YEAH?</i>

34:23.972 --> 34:25.724
- ARE WE READY?
- YES.

34:25.724 --> 34:26.725
LET'S GO, GUYS, YEAH?

34:26.725 --> 34:27.518
ALL RIGHT.

34:27.518 --> 34:28.977
LET'S MAKE IT
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.

34:30.646 --> 34:31.939
RIGHT THIS WAY.

34:31.939 --> 34:34.066
HERE'S OUR NEW FRESH MENU.
I'M SURE YOU'LL ENJOY IT.

34:34.066 --> 34:36.944
WHILE CHEF DON WILL BE WORKING
WITH KEVIN BEHIND THE LINE...

34:36.944 --> 34:38.654
YOU'RE THE EXPEDITER.

34:38.654 --> 34:41.448
CHEF RAMSAY WANTS JULIE TO BE
WORKING IN THE KITCHEN AS WELL,

34:41.448 --> 34:42.700
AND HE HAS
A CRITICAL TIP FOR HER

34:42.700 --> 34:44.451
BEFORE THE START OF SERVICE.

34:44.451 --> 34:46.203
YOU'VE GOT THIS DREADFUL HABIT
OF RUSHING THINGS.

34:46.203 --> 34:48.414
I KNOW, I--OKAY.
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN.

34:48.414 --> 34:49.152
RUSHING TAKES PLACE
IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.290
RUSHING TAKES PLACE
IN FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS.

34:50.290 --> 34:51.792
RIGHT.
YOU HAVE SOMETHING UNIQUE NOW.

34:51.792 --> 34:52.918
OKAY.
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT

34:52.918 --> 34:53.961
AND NURSE IT.
OKAY.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.546
ANYONE AROUND AND SAYS,
"WELL, WE WAITED,"

34:55.546 --> 34:57.381
NO, THEY'RE NOT REALLY
WAITING THAT LONG

34:57.381 --> 34:58.966
'CAUSE IT'S COOKED TO ORDER.
OKAY.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.509
GOT TO GET THAT THROUGH
IN THERE, YEAH?

35:00.509 --> 35:01.593
I KNOW, IT'S NEW.

35:01.593 --> 35:03.762
FIRST TICKET'S COMING IN.
HEARD?

35:03.762 --> 35:06.098
WE'RE WORKING ON NINE
CALAMARI AND AN ANTIPASTI SALAD.

35:06.098 --> 35:07.307
FANTASTIC, THANK YOU.

35:07.307 --> 35:08.934
CALAMARI'S GOING DOWN.

35:08.934 --> 35:10.561
CAN YOU FIRE TABLE FOUR,
PLEASE?

35:10.561 --> 35:12.521
YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

35:12.521 --> 35:13.731
YOU HAVE A FRIED ARTICHOKE
GOING, RIGHT?

35:13.731 --> 35:14.982
YES.
<i>AND THEN, THE NEXT APP</i>

35:14.982 --> 35:16.650
IS THE MEATBALLS.
COMING RIGHT UP.

35:16.650 --> 35:17.901
<i>MEATBALLS WORKING HARD.</i>
A MEATBALL APP.

35:17.901 --> 35:19.152
<i>KEVIN, I NEED</i>
<i>TWO FRIED ARTICHOKES</i>

35:19.152 --> 35:20.362
<i>KEVIN, I NEED</i>
<i>TWO FRIED ARTICHOKES</i>

35:20.362 --> 35:21.613
AND ONE CALAMARI.

35:21.613 --> 35:23.490
YOUR FIRST ONE'S GOING DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

35:23.490 --> 35:24.700
DON'T START THE CALAMARI.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.076
HE'S GOT FOUR CAESAR SALADS
ON THERE.

35:26.076 --> 35:27.745
DO YOU HAVE
AN ANTIPASTO SALAD MADE?

35:27.745 --> 35:28.871
YOU'RE DOING TWO AND EIGHT
RIGHT NOW?

35:28.871 --> 35:30.330
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>

35:30.330 --> 35:32.291
KEVIN, YOU HEARD ME
ON THAT FRIED ARTICHOKE?

35:32.291 --> 35:33.292
<i>YEAH, IT'S IN THE OVEN.</i>

35:33.292 --> 35:34.918
YEAH, YOU JUST ASKED
A MINUTE AGO, JULIE.

35:34.918 --> 35:36.211
GIVE HIM TIME.

35:36.211 --> 35:38.630
UNDERSTAND ONE THING,
WE'RE COOKING FOOD NOW...

35:38.630 --> 35:40.090
OKAY.
NOT REHEATING IT.

35:40.090 --> 35:41.467
<i>OKAY.</i>
SO YOU HAVE TO CUT THESE GUYS

35:41.467 --> 35:42.551
SOME SLACK.
ALL RIGHT.

35:42.551 --> 35:44.386
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE,
HOW WE'RE COOKING, RIGHT?

35:44.386 --> 35:45.888
YES, I DO.
THANK YOU.

35:45.888 --> 35:48.098
ALTHOUGH IT IS VERY EARLY
IN SERVICE,

35:48.098 --> 35:49.152
CHEF DON IS PUSHING ORDERS OUT
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

35:49.152 --> 35:51.060
CHEF DON IS PUSHING ORDERS OUT
IN A TIMELY MANNER.

35:51.060 --> 35:52.728
SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS
RIGHT HERE.

35:52.728 --> 35:55.564
AND CUSTOMERS ARE THRILLED
WITH WHAT THEY ARE RECEIVING.

35:55.564 --> 35:57.733
TASTES SO FRESH.
IT'S DELICIOUS.

35:57.733 --> 35:59.735
THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST LASAGNA
I'VE EVER HAD.

35:59.735 --> 36:01.779
BUT ABOUT 40 MINUTES
INTO SERVICE,

36:01.779 --> 36:04.406
JULIE'S FAST FOOD MENTALITY
IS RETURNING.

36:04.406 --> 36:05.741
CAN I TAKE THIS?
NOPE!

36:05.741 --> 36:07.743
SHE HAS LOST A GRIP
ON WHAT HAS BEEN SENT...

36:07.743 --> 36:09.912
HOW WE DOING ON THE CALAMARI
AND THE ARTICHOKE?

36:09.912 --> 36:11.497
ALREADY GONE.

36:11.497 --> 36:13.415
AND HAS FIRED TOO MANY ORDERS
TOO QUICKLY.

36:13.415 --> 36:15.042
APPETIZER IN THE WINDOW, JULIE,
WHAT THEY FOR?

36:15.042 --> 36:16.794
YOU GOT TWO CALAMARI--
I DON'T HAVE A TICKET FOR THESE,

36:16.794 --> 36:18.545
THAT'S WHAT I'M--
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

36:18.545 --> 36:19.152
CREATING CONFUSION
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:19.152 --> 36:21.173
CREATING CONFUSION
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:21.173 --> 36:23.050
KEVIN, I NEED
A CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.760
CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE
GOING DOWN.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.512
DON'T HURRY ON THEM
BECAUSE THEY'RE ONLY,

36:26.512 --> 36:27.721
<i>LIKE, HALFWAY</i>
<i>THROUGH THEIR FOOD.</i>

36:27.721 --> 36:29.598
HEY, WHO HAD THE CAKES?
THEY GOTTA GO OUT.

36:29.598 --> 36:31.892
WHAT'S WRONG?
THEY STILL HAVE THEIR FOOD.

36:31.892 --> 36:33.227
BUT--BUT THEY'RE READY.

36:33.227 --> 36:34.603
I KNOW.

36:34.603 --> 36:36.396
THIS IS CRAZY.
GET--GET YOUR MOTHER.

36:36.396 --> 36:38.107
THIS IS STUPID.

36:38.107 --> 36:40.025
<i>MOM, CHEF NEEDS YOU.</i>

36:40.025 --> 36:41.693
COME ON, JULIE..

36:42.986 --> 36:44.238
YES?
YOU'RE FIRING--

36:44.238 --> 36:45.989
COME HERE.
YOU'RE FIRING DESSERTS ON SEVEN.

36:45.989 --> 36:47.533
THEY'RE STILL EATING,
SO NOW, YOU'VE JUST

36:47.533 --> 36:49.076
COMPLETELY SCREWED US,
AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHY.

36:49.076 --> 36:49.152
OKAY.
LOOK,

36:49.152 --> 36:50.452
OKAY.
LOOK,

36:50.452 --> 36:51.745
THEY'RE READY.
"A," THEY DESERVE A GAP

36:51.745 --> 36:54.540
IN BETWEEN ENTREES,
APPETIZERS, AND DESSERTS.

36:54.540 --> 36:55.916
THIS IS TABLE SEVEN.

36:55.916 --> 36:58.252
YEAH, IT'S THIS ONE.
<i>OKAY?</i>

36:58.252 --> 36:59.837
I'M NOT--I-I--OKAY, I--
WELL, ANYWAY, JUST--

36:59.837 --> 37:00.963
BUT THEY HAVEN'T FINISHED
THEIR ENTREE, THAT'S ALL.

37:00.963 --> 37:02.548
I UNDERSTAND.
OKAY, OKAY. OKAY.

37:02.548 --> 37:03.590
LOOK, A CHOCOLATE MOLTEN LA--
IT'S NOT LIKE

37:03.590 --> 37:04.675
TAKING ICE CREAM
OUT THE FREEZER.

37:04.675 --> 37:05.968
I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S COOKED TO ORDER.

37:05.968 --> 37:07.719
I UNDERSTAND. WE'LL--OKAY.
BUT THEY'RE STILL EATING

37:07.719 --> 37:09.221
THEIR ENTREE...
WE'LL GET IT, OKAY.

37:09.221 --> 37:11.473
AND WE'RE NOT GONNA RAM THEM
AND STUFF THEM LIKE PIGS.

37:11.473 --> 37:13.267
IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR MY MOM
TO FOLLOW THROUGH

37:13.267 --> 37:15.936
WITH WHAT CHEF RAMSAY TOLD HER,
OR THIS PLACE WON'T SURVIVE.

37:17.271 --> 37:18.313
JULIE.

37:18.313 --> 37:19.152
YES?

37:19.152 --> 37:19.773
YES?

37:19.773 --> 37:22.609
THAT'S THE TRANSITION,
UNDERSTANDING THE WAIT.

37:22.609 --> 37:23.610
OKAY.
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE NOW

37:23.610 --> 37:25.112
WITH THIS FOOD,
SO YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND,

37:25.112 --> 37:27.281
JUST THE PACE SLOWS DOWN A BIT.
OKAY.

37:27.281 --> 37:28.657
REMEMBER, WE'RE A DIFFERENT
RESTAURANT THAN WE WERE...

37:28.657 --> 37:29.658
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

37:29.658 --> 37:30.742
HERE AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE WEEK.

37:30.742 --> 37:31.827
I'LL BE VERY CAREFUL.

37:31.827 --> 37:33.954
I ABSOLUTELY GOT THE POINT.
I HAVE TO REMEMBER,

37:33.954 --> 37:35.956
THIS ISN'T
A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT ANYMORE.

37:35.956 --> 37:38.041
WE ARE COOKING EVERYTHING
FRESH TO ORDER,

37:38.041 --> 37:39.793
AND IT TAKES TIME TO GET THERE.

37:39.793 --> 37:42.296
DIFFERENT SERVICE,
WE'RE USED TO SLAMMING FOOD OUT,

37:42.296 --> 37:44.256
SO THIS IS DIFFERENT.
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

37:44.256 --> 37:45.716
WHAT ABOUT TWO?
CAN YOU FIRE IT?

37:45.716 --> 37:46.925
ABSOLUTELY.

37:46.925 --> 37:48.177
TIRAMISU, 19.

37:48.177 --> 37:49.152
<i>ARE YOU READY FOR IT, ANDIE?</i>

37:49.152 --> 37:49.178
<i>ARE YOU READY FOR IT, ANDIE?</i>

37:49.178 --> 37:50.179
<i>YES.</i>
<i>OKAY.</i>

37:50.179 --> 37:51.180
CAN YOU RUN THAT TO FIVE,
PLEASE?

37:51.180 --> 37:52.973
SURE.

37:52.973 --> 37:55.726
CHEF RAMSAY'S WORDS HAVE NOW
CLEARLY REGISTERED WITH JULIE.

37:55.726 --> 37:56.685
<i>SO YOU'RE WORKING ON EIGHT</i>
<i>RIGHT NOW?</i>

37:56.685 --> 37:58.145
I'M DOING EIGHT RIGHT NOW, YES.

37:58.145 --> 38:00.314
YEAH, THEN I'M GONNA NEED 15
AND 1 RIGHT BEHIND IT.

38:00.314 --> 38:02.482
SHE IS NOW MANAGING THE KITCHEN
PROPERLY...

38:02.482 --> 38:03.650
ARTICHOKE HEARTS!

38:03.650 --> 38:05.527
THANK YOU.
I NEED A RUNNER.

38:05.527 --> 38:07.070
AND UNDERSTANDS
THAT THE OPERATION

38:07.070 --> 38:09.573
OF THE NEW MANGIA MANGIA
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

38:09.573 --> 38:10.532
THAN WHAT IT WAS BEFORE....

38:11.742 --> 38:13.327
GLAD IT WASN'T MICROWAVED.

38:13.327 --> 38:16.038
AND SO IS THE APPRECIATION
FOR THE FOOD.

38:16.038 --> 38:17.581
THIS LOOKS REALLY FRESH.

38:17.581 --> 38:19.152
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS
PART OF OUR DATE NIGHT.

38:19.152 --> 38:19.458
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS
PART OF OUR DATE NIGHT.

38:19.458 --> 38:22.336
IT'S BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE SEEN THIS RESTAURANT

38:22.336 --> 38:25.130
WITH SO MUCH ENERGY
AND REPEAT CUSTOMERS.

38:25.130 --> 38:27.174
MANGIA MANGIA
IS DEFINITELY BACK.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.467
CHRIS, HOW WE DOING
OUT THERE?

38:28.467 --> 38:30.636
EVERYTHING IS VERY SMOOTH
SO FAR, CHEF.

38:30.636 --> 38:31.970
GOOD.
THEY LOVE IT.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.513
GREAT, GOOD TO HEAR.
THEY LOVE THE FOOD.

38:33.513 --> 38:35.641
THEY'RE THRILLED, THEY JUST
THINK IT'S SO DELICIOUS.

38:35.641 --> 38:37.100
GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS.

38:37.100 --> 38:39.686
NO, GOOD JOB, YOU.

38:39.686 --> 38:41.647
I SAW A HUGE CHANGE IN JULIE.

38:41.647 --> 38:44.691
SHE WAS ACTUALLY STANDING
ON THE LINE, NOT SCREAMING,

38:44.691 --> 38:46.652
JUST KEEPING EVERYBODY
COMMUNICATING.

38:46.652 --> 38:49.152
IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS REBORN. IT WAS PERFECT.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.072
IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,
SHE WAS REBORN. IT WAS PERFECT.

38:50.072 --> 38:53.575
VERY NICE JOB.
NICE JOB, UP TOP.

38:53.575 --> 38:54.743
IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME

38:54.743 --> 38:56.495
THAT I FINALLY HAVE
A SUCCESSFUL RESTAURANT.

38:56.495 --> 38:58.080
NO MORE MESSING AROUND
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

38:58.080 --> 39:00.791
I'M THE BOSS.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.834
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D BE STANDING HERE

39:02.834 --> 39:04.294
WITH A HUGE SMILE
ON MY FACE.

39:04.294 --> 39:05.545
ME EITHER, HONESTLY.

39:06.672 --> 39:08.465
WELL DONE.
OH, THANK YOU.

39:08.465 --> 39:11.718
ALL OF YOU, A INCREDIBLY
SUCCESSFUL RE-LAUNCH.

39:11.718 --> 39:13.679
<i>HOW DO YOU FEEL?</i>
GREAT.

39:13.679 --> 39:15.889
GOOD, AND SO YOU SHOULD.

39:15.889 --> 39:17.808
<i>AND SO YOU SHOULD.</i>
<i>GOOD JOB.</i>

39:17.808 --> 39:19.152
AS DRAMATIC AS THE CHANGE THIS
RESTAURANT HAS GONE THROUGH,

39:19.152 --> 39:20.519
AS DRAMATIC AS THE CHANGE THIS
RESTAURANT HAS GONE THROUGH,

39:20.519 --> 39:22.729
<i>THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE</i>
<i>THAT WAS EVEN MORE DRAMATIC,</i>

39:22.729 --> 39:25.649
AND THAT WAS JULIE.
MY DARLING, TONIGHT,

39:25.649 --> 39:28.568
YOU TOOK THE REINS
AND YOU WERE IN CHARGE.

39:28.568 --> 39:31.071
YOU SOUNDED AND YOU LOOKED
LIKE A BOSS.

39:31.071 --> 39:32.072
GOOD JOB.

39:32.072 --> 39:33.365
<i>REALLY GOOD JOB.</i>

39:33.365 --> 39:34.408
<i>VERY GOOD JOB.</i>
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

39:34.408 --> 39:35.409
YEAH, TREMENDOUS HELP
BACK THERE.

39:35.409 --> 39:36.535
YEAH, IT WAS.
IT REALLY WAS.

39:36.535 --> 39:37.869
YEAH, SHE DIDN'T SWEAR
EITHER.

39:37.869 --> 39:38.912
YEAH.
NO.

39:38.912 --> 39:40.330
I DIDN'T.

39:40.330 --> 39:42.541
JUST SLOW DOWN
AND YOU'RE GONNA NAIL IT.

39:42.541 --> 39:45.210
THERE WAS A REALLY BIG CHANGE
IN MY MOM TONIGHT.

39:45.210 --> 39:46.712
BEFORE ALL OF THIS STARTED,
YOU COULD TELL

39:46.712 --> 39:48.046
MY MOM DIDN'T REALLY WANT
TO BE HERE.

39:48.046 --> 39:49.152
SHE WOULD CURSE AND SHE WOULD
NOT CARE IF THINGS WENT WRONG,

39:49.152 --> 39:50.674
SHE WOULD CURSE AND SHE WOULD
NOT CARE IF THINGS WENT WRONG,

39:50.674 --> 39:52.384
OR SHE WOULD JUST
GET FRUSTRATED.

39:52.384 --> 39:55.053
MY MOM REALLY STEPPED UP
AND REALLY ACTED LIKE THE OWNER.

39:55.053 --> 39:59.558
I NEED YOU ALL
TO MAKE A PROMISE TO ME.

39:59.558 --> 40:03.645
<i>WE CANNOT GO BACK.</i>
<i>THERE'LL BE NO SHORTCUTS.</i>

40:03.645 --> 40:05.022
NO FREEZING

40:05.022 --> 40:06.940
NO MICROWAVES.
<i>AND NO MICROWAVES.</i>

40:06.940 --> 40:08.608
THANK YOU.
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, YES?

40:08.608 --> 40:09.609
YES.

40:09.609 --> 40:11.111
THERE'S NO GOING BACK.
HANDS UP.

40:11.111 --> 40:12.112
<i>SWEAR.</i>

40:12.112 --> 40:13.238
SWEAR.

40:13.238 --> 40:16.158
THANK YOU.
PLEASE MAINTAIN THESE STANDARDS.

40:16.158 --> 40:17.576
I WILL, I PROMISE.

40:17.576 --> 40:19.152
MAKE IT HAPPEN, GUYS, YEAH?
GOOD JOB.

40:19.152 --> 40:19.661
MAKE IT HAPPEN, GUYS, YEAH?
GOOD JOB.

40:19.661 --> 40:20.662
MWAH. MAKE SURE
YOU LOOK AFTER MOM.

40:20.662 --> 40:21.747
ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

40:21.747 --> 40:22.706
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.

40:22.706 --> 40:23.707
SERIOUSLY, WELL DONE.
THANK YOU.

40:23.707 --> 40:24.708
GOOD JOB, YEAH?
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

40:24.708 --> 40:25.792
I'M ROOTING FOR YOU.

40:25.792 --> 40:27.544
I HOPE SO.
I'M--IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

40:27.544 --> 40:28.962
YOU CAN DO IT, OKAY?
OKAY.

40:28.962 --> 40:30.630
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS. WELL DONE.
THANK YOU, GOOD NIGHT.

40:30.630 --> 40:31.631
<i>WELL DONE.</i>

40:31.631 --> 40:32.841
CHEF RAMSAY DID EVERYTHING.

40:32.841 --> 40:33.925
THERE ARE JUST SIMPLY NO WORDS

40:33.925 --> 40:35.594
THAT CAN DESCRIBE
MY THANKS TO HIM.

40:35.594 --> 40:38.597
I'M GONNA HAVE GOOD FOOD,
THE WORD'S GONNA GET OUT,

40:38.597 --> 40:41.016
AND I CAN COME
INTO MY RESTAURANT AND BE PROUD.

40:41.016 --> 40:42.392
WHEW.

40:42.392 --> 40:44.561
WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE,
MANGIA MANGIA MAY HAVE BEEN

40:44.561 --> 40:47.272
THE ONLY RESTAURANT IN AMERICA
THAT DIDN'T USE AN OVEN.

40:47.272 --> 40:49.152
THAT'S HOW BAD IT GOT.
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

40:49.152 --> 40:49.733
THAT'S HOW BAD IT GOT.
AND ON TOP OF THAT,

40:49.733 --> 40:52.152
THERE WAS SO MUCH ANIMOSITY
BETWEEN THE STAFF MEMBERS,

40:52.152 --> 40:54.071
JULIE WAS COMPLETELY LOST.

40:54.071 --> 40:56.365
THIS HAS TO BE ONE
OF THE BIGGEST TRANSFORMATIONS

40:56.365 --> 40:58.825
EVER ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,

40:58.825 --> 41:00.202
THE TOWN OF WOODLAND PARK

41:00.202 --> 41:01.912
MAY ONLY HAVE
ONE ITALIAN RESTAURANT,

41:01.912 --> 41:04.664
BUT RIGHT NOW,
THEY'VE GOT A GREAT ONE.

41:04.664 --> 41:10.629
- WOW, A DRIVE-THROUGH ITALIAN.
- , THAT'S A FIRST FOR ME.

41:10.629 --> 41:14.549
HE SMELLS REALLY GOOD.
HE REALLY DOES.

41:14.549 --> 41:16.510
ONE MORE THING I HAVE TO DO.

41:17.719 --> 41:19.152
<i>SOMEBODY'S AT THE WINDOW.</i>

41:19.152 --> 41:19.554
<i>SOMEBODY'S AT THE WINDOW.</i>

41:19.554 --> 41:21.264
ONE MICROWAVE TO GO,
PLEASE.

41:21.264 --> 41:22.349
<i>OKAY.</i>
THANK YOU.

41:24.601 --> 41:25.769
OKAY.

41:25.769 --> 41:27.145
CAN YOU MANAGE?

41:27.145 --> 41:28.438
<i>WE'LL SEE.</i>

41:31.858 --> 41:32.859
THAT'S IT.

41:32.859 --> 41:34.986
DOESN'T FIT THAT WAY.

41:34.986 --> 41:36.363
THANK YOU.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.698
<i>HERE, THERE WE GO.</i>
CLOSE YOUR WINDOW.

41:38.698 --> 41:39.950
THERE--HOLD ON.

41:39.950 --> 41:41.451
CLOSE YOUR WINDOW, THANK YOU.
<i>CLOSING.</i>

41:43.870 --> 41:46.915
JANELLE?
JANELLE? JANELLE?

41:46.915 --> 41:48.041
COMING.
HOLD ON THE BOTTOM, DARLING.

41:48.041 --> 41:49.152
<i>OKAY.</i>
THAT'S IT.

41:49.152 --> 41:49.251
<i>OKAY.</i>
THAT'S IT.

41:49.251 --> 41:50.502
AND I'VE GOT THE WEIGHT,
I'VE GOT THE LOAD.

41:50.502 --> 41:51.670
<i>OKAY.</i>
OKAY, JUST SHOVE IT IN THERE.

41:51.670 --> 41:52.504
OKAY.

41:52.504 --> 41:53.505
<i>THANK YOU, DARLING.</i>

41:53.505 --> 41:55.048
<i>YOU'RE WELCOME.</i>

41:56.049 --> 41:57.092
EXCELLENT. BYE-BYE.

41:57.092 --> 41:58.593
BYE.

42:01.096 --> 42:03.223
<i>OH,.</i>

42:03.223 --> 42:05.600
<i>OH, THAT WAS FUNNY.</i>

42:08.228 --> 42:10.856
AFTER CHEF RAMSAY LEFT,
THE POSITIVE MOOD

42:10.856 --> 42:14.484
AND THE POSITIVE FEEDBACK
CONTINUED AT MANGIA MANGIA.

42:14.484 --> 42:17.195
JULIE ENDED UP EXTENDING
CHEF DON'S STAY...

42:17.195 --> 42:19.152
FIRING TABLE TEN, I NEED
A LASAGNA AND A SHORT RIB.

42:19.152 --> 42:20.449
FIRING TABLE TEN, I NEED
A LASAGNA AND A SHORT RIB.

42:20.449 --> 42:22.534
LASAGNA'S GOT FIVE MINUTES.

42:22.534 --> 42:23.952
AND WITH HIS LEADERSHIP,

42:23.952 --> 42:25.745
THE KITCHEN IS MUCH BETTER
ORGANIZED,

42:25.745 --> 42:29.332
AND JULIE IS EVEN NOW
SPENDING TIME BEHIND THE LINE.

42:29.332 --> 42:32.210
WE HAVE A BEET, A CAESAR,
AND A CALAMARI.

42:32.210 --> 42:33.628
CALAMARI'S COMING UP.

42:33.628 --> 42:34.838
YOU GUYS ARE DOING
A GREAT JOB.

42:34.838 --> 42:36.089
THANK YOU.

42:36.089 --> 42:37.757
JULIE IS A CHANGED WOMAN,

42:37.757 --> 42:40.552
AND SHE FINALLY HAS

42:40.552 --> 42:43.221
A QUAINT,
PREMIER ITALIAN RESTAURANT

42:43.221 --> 42:46.391
IN THE PICTURESQUE TOWN
OF WOODLAND PARK, COLORADO.

42:46.391 --> 42:47.559
REALLY GOOD.

42:47.559 --> 42:48.643
THANKS FOR COMING IN.

42:48.643 --> 42:49.152
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.

42:49.152 --> 42:50.187
THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING.

42:50.187 --> 42:52.772
ALL THE CRITICISM
THAT I GOT FROM CHEF RAMSAY

42:52.772 --> 42:55.025
WAS, IN THE LONG RUN,
VERY GOOD.

42:55.025 --> 42:57.611
I HAVE A BETTER RESTAURANT.
BUSINESS IS GREAT.

42:57.611 --> 42:59.988
IT'S GONNA BE A WONDERFUL YEAR.
I KNOW IT.
