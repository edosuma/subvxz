WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:09.509
Oh, hey, Frasier.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.577
Hmm? Ah.

00:10.577 --> 00:12.078
Ooh, catalogues.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.580
Yes, I'm trying to find

00:13.580 --> 00:16.082
the perfect wedding gift
for Daphne and Donny.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.384
Oh, right.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.185
Well, now that
they've set a date,

00:19.185 --> 00:21.521
I guess I'll be getting
my bridesmaid draft notice.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.323
You know, Roz,
she may not even ask you.

00:23.323 --> 00:25.258
Oh, she'll ask me.

00:25.258 --> 00:26.126
They all do.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.427
Ah.

00:27.427 --> 00:28.828
The next thing I know,

00:28.828 --> 00:30.330
I'm wearing some revolting
puffy-sleeved dress

00:30.864 --> 00:32.832
made from the same material
that keeps the space shuttle

00:32.832 --> 00:34.868
from burning up during reentry.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.937
You know, Roz,
Daphne might just surprise you

00:37.937 --> 00:39.239
and pick a dress you like.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.007
Oh, impossible.
They're always ugly.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.542
That's the way
the bride makes sure

00:42.542 --> 00:43.977
she's the prettiest one
at her wedding.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.412
Gee, that's awfully
cynical.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.414
Oh, yeah? When was the last time
you found yourself

00:47.414 --> 00:49.716
staring at a bridesmaid
instead of the bride?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.419
That would've been at
my wedding to Lilith.

00:55.855 --> 00:56.856
Hello, Frasier.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.224
Oh, Niles!

00:58.224 --> 01:00.060
Frasier, do you remember
the time the Kriezel brothers

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
tied me to their Great Dane
and lobbed meatballs

01:02.062 --> 01:04.531
down their gravel driveway?

01:04.531 --> 01:06.966
I've told you, Niles,
I would've helped you,

01:06.966 --> 01:09.469
but their sister
was holding me down.

01:09.469 --> 01:10.403
No, my point is--

01:10.403 --> 01:11.971
a cappuccino, please--

01:11.971 --> 01:13.473
even that experience
was less painful

01:13.473 --> 01:14.974
than the date
I was just on.

01:14.974 --> 01:17.977
She was...

01:17.977 --> 01:20.246
a cat person.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.650
She brought her cat on our date.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.418
Oh, Lord.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.720
Well, she had good reason--
it was Mr. Waggles' birthday.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.222
Oh, dear.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.224
Actually,
his birthday party.

01:31.224 --> 01:32.225
Oh.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.227
Actually, his surprise
birthday party.

01:34.227 --> 01:35.995
Oh, Niles,
I'm sorry.

01:35.995 --> 01:38.565
Where on earth
did you meet this woman?

01:38.565 --> 01:40.867
At Nordstroms. We both reached
for the same cashmere throw.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.368
When she said
she needed something

01:42.368 --> 01:43.870
to keep her waggles warm

01:43.870 --> 01:46.272
I thought it was
a coy euphemism, but...

01:46.272 --> 01:47.674
Thank you.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.175
Yes. Well, Niles,

01:49.175 --> 01:50.677
I certainly understand
your being upset,

01:50.677 --> 01:52.412
but you know you've got
to keep on looking.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.214
Well, trust me,
with Daphne getting married

01:54.214 --> 01:55.715
I have no choice
but to press on.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.217
But I'm going to change
my strategy.

01:57.217 --> 01:59.719
Do you recall the other day
at the health club

01:59.719 --> 02:01.154
Tony Hubner gave me
that phone number?

02:01.154 --> 02:02.922
Dear God, Niles,
not a dating service.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.291
No. It's not a dating service.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.695
It's an introduction network
for busy professionals.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.597
I give them
my vital statistics

02:10.597 --> 02:11.564
and there's an extensive

02:11.564 --> 02:12.565
screening process.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.534
They bill me
at the end of the month.

02:14.534 --> 02:15.935
Niles, please,

02:15.935 --> 02:18.304
they are all
money-grabbing con artists

02:18.304 --> 02:20.707
who prey on the pathetic
and the lonely.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.942
For God's sake, you
sign up with visions

02:22.942 --> 02:25.745
of some PhD candidate
and what do they deliver?

02:25.745 --> 02:27.280
A buck-toothed librarian

02:27.280 --> 02:30.316
who needs help
washing her mother.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.053
Are you really
that desperate?

02:34.053 --> 02:35.421
Half an hour ago,

02:35.421 --> 02:37.390
I had my left leg tethered
to Mr. Waggles' forepaw

02:37.390 --> 02:41.828
and we came in third
in the five-legged race.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.599
Geez, you'd think they'd
let him win on his birthday.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.440
I know, Mum, but
it is my wedding.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.442
I've given in to you
on so many things.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.411
Couldn't this one
thing go my way?

02:58.411 --> 03:01.881
I just don't like
those tiny corns in me salad.

03:01.881 --> 03:05.618
No, I don't hate you.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.388
Well, that's just not true.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.390
I'm glad you're alive.

03:10.890 --> 03:11.891
All right, all right.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.393
Tiny corn it is.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.394
I've got to run now.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.361
Cheery-bye.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.896
(sighs)

03:16.896 --> 03:17.897
That was Mum.

03:17.897 --> 03:18.898
Mmm.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.300
She had a thought
about the salad.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.801
Something told me

03:21.801 --> 03:24.304
yesterday's crouton skirmish
wasn't the end of it.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.073
I suppose she can be
a bit overbearing,

03:27.073 --> 03:28.908
but, as she often
points out,

03:28.908 --> 03:30.910
she is paying
for the wedding,

03:30.910 --> 03:32.345
and I am her
only daughter,

03:32.345 --> 03:34.847
and giving birth to me
was so painful

03:34.847 --> 03:37.684
she did bite through
a kitchen spoon.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.353
Daphne...

03:40.353 --> 03:41.688
just don't let your mother
guilt you

03:41.688 --> 03:43.723
into having the wedding
that she wants

03:43.723 --> 03:44.991
instead of the wedding you want.

03:44.991 --> 03:45.792
Oh, don't worry.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.793
Mum already
promised me

03:47.293 --> 03:48.795
I could have the
wedding I want...

03:48.795 --> 03:51.631
as soon as I have a daughter
who gets engaged.

03:52.465 --> 03:53.933
Oh, hey, Dad.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.435
Oh, Fras...

03:55.435 --> 03:56.936
you're going to
love this stuff

03:56.936 --> 03:58.938
I got from the
farmer's market.

03:58.938 --> 04:01.441
This guy takes the
juiciest cut of filet mignon,

04:01.441 --> 04:03.943
slices it real thin and
makes jerky out of it.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.445
Oh, Dad,
I'm not really in...

04:05.445 --> 04:06.412
Not bad, huh?

04:08.348 --> 04:12.151
Yes, if only I had a nice
powdered cabernet to go with it.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.386
Dad, listen...

04:13.386 --> 04:14.854
have you given any thought

04:14.854 --> 04:15.855
to Daphne's wedding present?

04:15.855 --> 04:18.358
Oh, now, Frasier, not
everybody likes jerky

04:18.358 --> 04:19.858
as much as you and me.

04:19.858 --> 04:20.860
No, Dad...

04:21.293 --> 04:23.263
No, no, I just want to
get her something special.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.665
Especially since her mother
seems to be taking all the joy

04:25.665 --> 04:26.633
out of it for her.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.501
Oh, how about a nice
piece of luggage?

04:28.501 --> 04:30.670
You know,
a good, hard suitcase,

04:30.670 --> 04:32.538
like the kind people
used to put stickers on

04:32.538 --> 04:33.539
to show everybody
where they'd been.

04:33.539 --> 04:34.507
Remember your grandad's?

04:34.507 --> 04:35.541
Mm-hmm.

04:35.541 --> 04:37.043
His whole life
was on it.

04:37.043 --> 04:40.546
Topeka, Sioux Falls,
Biloxi.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.416
It was like a map
of the world.

04:43.416 --> 04:44.784
Yes, what a loss to us all

04:44.784 --> 04:46.753
that he failed
to write his memoirs.

04:46.753 --> 04:49.088
I'm thinking of something
that would matter to Daphne.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.959
(hiccuping): Something that shows
her how we feel-- good Lord.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.927
A little spicy,
wasn't it?

04:54.927 --> 04:58.364
You know, maybe we should get
something for her wedding.

04:58.364 --> 04:59.432
Like what?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.434
I don't know, uh...

05:01.434 --> 05:03.403
the flowers, say.

05:03.403 --> 05:04.437
That's it.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.706
We could offer to pay
for her wedding flowers.

05:06.706 --> 05:07.507
Wow, that's a bit pricey,
isn't it?

05:08.007 --> 05:08.841
Don't worry
about it, Dad.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.677
(hiccuping):
You just donate

05:10.677 --> 05:12.211
what you can,
and I'll pay for the rest.

05:12.211 --> 05:14.180
Good God, what was
in that jerky?

05:14.180 --> 05:15.682
You just ate it too fast.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.116
Next time,
you have to savor it a little.

05:17.116 --> 05:19.085
Trust me, Dad, I'm never going
to taste that vile stuff again.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.854
(hiccuping):
Oop. Spoke too soon.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.589
Mmm...

05:23.589 --> 05:25.591
Daphne, may I have a
word with you, please?

05:25.591 --> 05:27.126
What is it, Dr. Crane?

05:27.126 --> 05:28.127
Well...

05:28.127 --> 05:29.429
it's about your
wedding gift.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.064
Now...

05:31.064 --> 05:33.833
I know it's not traditionally
the role of a friend,

05:33.833 --> 05:35.335
but we consider you family

05:35.335 --> 05:36.836
so please don't say no.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.805
Dad and I would be honored
to pay for your wedding...

05:38.805 --> 05:40.640
(hiccups)

05:40.640 --> 05:41.441
Pay for my wedding?

05:41.441 --> 05:42.742
(hiccups)

05:42.742 --> 05:43.910
How wonderful!

05:43.910 --> 05:47.113
(hiccuping)

05:47.113 --> 05:50.717
That's the most generous gift
I could ever imagine!

05:50.717 --> 05:51.951
What's all
the hubbub?

05:51.951 --> 05:53.353
Dr. Crane just told me

05:53.353 --> 05:54.854
about your incredible
wedding present!

05:54.854 --> 05:56.856
Oh!

05:56.856 --> 05:59.659
You people are heaven-sent.

05:59.659 --> 06:00.960
Well, I'm glad
you like it and...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.462
and you know what?

06:02.462 --> 06:03.796
We're going to throw in

06:03.796 --> 06:05.064
a piece of
luggage, as well.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.033
I'm just so
overwhelmed.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.534
See, I told you.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.535
Everybody loves luggage.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.037
Dad!

06:11.037 --> 06:13.039
She thinks we're paying
for her whole wedding.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.040
What?!

06:14.040 --> 06:16.042
Well, I tried to say
"wedding flowers"

06:16.042 --> 06:17.009
but then I hiccuped.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.945
I'm not paying for a wedding.
Of course not.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.380
I'll just clear this
whole thing right up

06:20.380 --> 06:22.181
right now before it goes
any further. Daphne!

06:22.181 --> 06:24.050
You know what this
means, don't you?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.051
Now that Mum's
not paying,

06:25.051 --> 06:26.886
she can't make me
have it in England.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.088
I can have my wedding
how I want it

06:29.088 --> 06:30.890
and where I want it right here.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.859
You've answered my prayers.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.360
(sobbing)

06:35.361 --> 06:37.730
(doorbell rings)

06:37.730 --> 06:39.565
DAPHNE:
Could someone let Donny in?

06:39.565 --> 06:40.933
Oh, well, look...

06:40.933 --> 06:42.335
Donny's a very
traditional guy.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.270
He's not going to let us
pay for his wedding.

06:44.270 --> 06:45.805
Right.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.840
You saw how he proposed
to her-- on bended knee.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.609
He's nothing if not
a hopeless romantic.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.879
Any idiot knows you got to pay
a hooker in cash.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.881
I'm in a meeting.
I'll call you later. Bye.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.883
Hey, guys.
How you doing? Hi, Donny.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.352
I got this client--
he's in the middle of a divorce, right?

06:59.352 --> 07:00.820
And his wife
finds all these charges

07:00.820 --> 07:02.822
from this place
called Executive Match.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.323
Turns out to be
a call girl service.

07:04.323 --> 07:05.825
Oh, boy,
when she gets through with him,

07:05.825 --> 07:07.326
she'll have
his house, his car...

07:07.827 --> 07:10.329
She'd have his beach house, too,
if I hadn't already taken it.

07:10.329 --> 07:11.164
Women.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.832
DONNY:
Hi, honey.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.133
Hi, sweetie.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.170
Have they
told you yet?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.171
Uh... told me what?

07:18.171 --> 07:19.672
You're not going
to believe this

07:19.672 --> 07:21.174
but Dr. Crane
and his father

07:21.174 --> 07:23.543
have offered to pay
for our entire wedding.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.378
(weak chuckle)

07:25.378 --> 07:26.879
Is this a joke?

07:30.716 --> 07:33.152
It could be.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.554
Just a minute.
Honey, it's one thing

07:34.554 --> 07:35.521
for us
to let your family pay.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.523
They're your parents
and it's traditional,

07:37.523 --> 07:38.825
but this is...

07:38.825 --> 07:40.626
Going too far?
Being presumptuous?

07:40.626 --> 07:41.928
We don't want to
step on any toes.

07:41.928 --> 07:44.063
I didn't think you'd be
uncomfortable with this.

07:44.063 --> 07:45.364
But he clearly is,
Daphne.

07:45.364 --> 07:46.365
Donny's right.
We're not family.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.366
Absolutely.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.868
You know, we've
got that thing....

07:48.868 --> 07:50.870
Wait, wait a minute--
what am I doing?

07:50.870 --> 07:51.838
Here you guys...

07:51.838 --> 07:53.773
you're making
this lovely gesture

07:53.773 --> 07:55.074
and I'm just insulting you.

07:55.074 --> 07:57.243
No, no, no,
I mean, if you guys

07:57.243 --> 07:59.912
are not family to Daphne,
then who is?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.714
Of course you can pay
for the wedding.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.115
Thank you, thank you.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.985
Thank you, family.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.488
I just knew he'd see how
much this meant to you.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.889
Oh, God, I'm
tearing up again.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.290
Don't start
with the waterworks

08:11.290 --> 08:12.758
because you're going
to get me going here.

08:12.758 --> 08:13.793
What is that, jerky?

08:13.793 --> 08:15.294
Could I have
some of that?

08:15.294 --> 08:16.295
Help yourself.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.663
"Made from filet mignon."

08:17.663 --> 08:19.432
How much did this stuff
set you back?

08:19.432 --> 08:21.868
You have no idea.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.877
Now, as far as
the reception goes

08:30.877 --> 08:32.311
I've narrowed it down
to two places.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.246
I'm leaning towards
Captain Jonah's.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.249
The view of the water's lovely

08:36.249 --> 08:39.217
but you have to walk through
a whale's mouth to get inside.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.655
I hesitate to ask
how you exit.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.225
Got to run.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.927
I have a meeting
with the DJ.

08:48.761 --> 08:51.264
(heavy sigh)

08:51.264 --> 08:53.266
I thought she'd
never leave.

08:53.766 --> 08:54.767
Well... good God, Roz.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.269
How long have
you been there?

08:56.269 --> 08:58.771
Since you two walked
in and trapped me.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.273
Aren't you taking this thing
a bit too far

09:00.273 --> 09:02.275
just trying to avoid
an unflattering dress?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.776
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.778
That's why I've been
carrying around this picture

09:05.778 --> 09:07.246
of the last time
I was a bridesmaid.

09:07.246 --> 09:11.017
Good Lord, Roz, you look like
you've been tented for termites.

09:11.017 --> 09:13.686
Exactly.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.591
Well, it sounds like she's
having fun planning her wedding.

09:18.591 --> 09:20.326
Yes, now that she can
have things her way

09:20.326 --> 09:21.227
and not
her mother's.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.562
She's lucky you came along.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.263
Well, yes and no.

09:24.263 --> 09:27.099
You know, I sit here
and let her make...

09:27.099 --> 09:30.102
questionable choices...

09:30.102 --> 09:32.572
and I say nothing because I know
it's going to cost me less.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.106
I'm sorry.
You know what?

09:34.106 --> 09:36.576
I've got to change my thinking
about this whole thing.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.544
I mean, what good is my money

09:38.544 --> 09:41.047
if I'm denying her the best gift
I have to offer--

09:41.047 --> 09:43.549
my taste and expertise.

09:45.051 --> 09:49.055
Frankly, what Daphne really
deserves is the gift of Frasier.

09:52.024 --> 09:54.026
Suddenly that crock pot
I'm giving them

09:54.026 --> 09:55.027
doesn't sound so bad.

09:55.027 --> 09:55.962
Oh, shut up.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.366
Hello, Niles.

10:00.366 --> 10:01.701
You look like a man
who's waiting

10:01.701 --> 10:03.069
to be asked
why he's grinning.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.438
Oh, I was just thinkin'...

10:05.438 --> 10:06.939
about the other day
when you said

10:07.440 --> 10:09.942
how you thought dating services
were all a big con.

10:09.942 --> 10:10.943
Well, I just got conned

10:10.943 --> 10:12.945
into meeting
the most enchanting woman.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.880
Well, I don't know
what to say.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.716
And I owe it all
to Executive Match.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.618
Now I do.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.488
The name of this service
is Executive Match?

10:22.488 --> 10:24.790
That's right. You thought
these women were all beneath me.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.258
Beneath you and
countless others.

10:26.258 --> 10:27.493
Do you have any idea...?

10:27.493 --> 10:28.794
Shh. Here she is.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.795
Sabrina, could...?

10:29.795 --> 10:31.297
Oh, sorry.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.598
She's always
on the phone.

10:35.234 --> 10:36.569
Whatever it is
she does for a living,

10:36.569 --> 10:38.371
she's in great demand.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.073
So you have no idea
what line of work Sabrina's in?

10:41.073 --> 10:43.042
No. I'm guessing
high-priced lawyer.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.044
I heard her quote
her hourly rate on the phone.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.545
Believe me,
you don't want to be

10:46.545 --> 10:48.047
on the receiving end
of that bill.

10:48.047 --> 10:49.548
(chuckling)

10:49.548 --> 10:50.349
Niles...

10:50.349 --> 10:51.684
I feel I must warn you...

10:51.684 --> 10:52.985
oh, now, please

10:52.985 --> 10:54.320
spare me your
condescending advice.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.288
Why can't you simply
say you were wrong?

10:56.288 --> 10:58.057
You have no idea
what you're doing.

10:58.057 --> 11:01.360
I know exactly what I'm doing.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.362
And you could learn
a thing or two from me,

11:03.362 --> 11:05.164
Mr. One-date-and-it's-over.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.468
I am taking it slow
with Sabrina.

11:09.468 --> 11:11.170
You mean you
haven't...? Haven't...?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.338
You know... haven't?
Haven't...?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.706
Oh, please. Are you mad?

11:13.706 --> 11:15.708
You don't proposition
a woman like that

11:15.708 --> 11:17.143
on the first date.

11:17.143 --> 11:18.878
Last night
after dinner

11:18.878 --> 11:20.212
I dropped her home
with nothing more

11:20.212 --> 11:21.681
than a courtly kiss
on the wrist.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.717
Tonight may proceed
to hand-holding.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.218
And if all goes well,
in two weeks,

11:26.218 --> 11:29.221
I shall storm the citadel
of her womanhood.

11:31.057 --> 11:34.126
Mmm... Sabrina...

11:34.126 --> 11:36.362
(chuckling)

11:36.362 --> 11:37.697
This is Frasier.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.964
Hello. Lovely
to meet you.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.466
Nice to meet you.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.702
You really have a great brother.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.503
Oh, he's charming
and witty

11:44.503 --> 11:47.006
and intelligent
and handsome.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.007
(chuckling)

11:48.007 --> 11:50.443
I paid her to say that.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.678
Of course you did.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.453
(doorbell rings)

12:00.453 --> 12:03.355
Ah, finally,
the doves have arrived.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.290
Come in. Come in.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.125
Lazlo, thank you
so much for coming.

12:06.125 --> 12:06.959
Lovely flowers.

12:06.959 --> 12:08.494
I'll let you know.

12:08.494 --> 12:11.464
Dr. Crane, was that
the florist for my wedding?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.966
In his dreams!

12:13.966 --> 12:14.967
Good God.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.470
The man's arrangements
are one big cliche.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.471
Look at this.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.506
His answer to everything
is baby's breath,

12:20.506 --> 12:23.008
baby's breath,
baby's breath.

12:23.008 --> 12:24.510
Does that woman with the harp

12:24.510 --> 12:26.812
have something to do
with my wedding, too?

12:26.812 --> 12:29.048
No, Daphne,
she's selling them door-to-door.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.751
Of course it's
for your wedding.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.585
She's auditioning.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.587
Dr. Crane, I really
don't think...

12:34.587 --> 12:36.555
MARTIN:
Oh, good, Daphne. You're here, too.

12:36.555 --> 12:39.892
Listen, I want to show
you guys a little something

12:39.892 --> 12:41.727
I thought up
for the wedding.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.230
"It is now the time
in the ceremony for the rings.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.998
May I have them,
please?"

12:50.970 --> 12:52.905
'Course, it's
a lot more effective

12:52.905 --> 12:54.807
when he's in his little tux.

12:54.807 --> 12:55.708
Dad, please.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.511
It's all just
a bit much, isn't it?

12:58.511 --> 13:00.813
We don't want to turn
this wedding into a circus.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.314
Now, where's the dove man?

13:02.314 --> 13:03.749
Dr. Crane, about
the doves...

13:03.749 --> 13:05.151
Just picture it, Daphne.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.886
Aren't they
something?

13:06.886 --> 13:08.754
As you and Donny
exit the church,

13:08.754 --> 13:10.256
one dozen white
birds of peace

13:10.756 --> 13:12.258
will be released
and circle above.

13:12.758 --> 13:14.260
Of course, we'll
use 14, actually.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.762
The power lines
always take out a few.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.266
Thank you so much.

13:22.768 --> 13:24.203
Dr. Crane,

13:24.203 --> 13:25.671
about the doves,

13:25.671 --> 13:27.173
it just seems a little grand.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.042
I mean, what's wrong
with throwing a bit of rice?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.444
Oh, well, uh,
if you want rice,

13:32.444 --> 13:34.713
of course,
you'll have rice.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.516
Sometimes it seems
nothing I do is good enough.

13:37.516 --> 13:38.517
No, no, no.

13:38.517 --> 13:40.019
I-I suppose doves
will be fine.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.022
Frasier, is that Reverend
Franklin in the kitchen?

13:43.022 --> 13:44.390
Yes, it is, Dad.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.659
You're auditioning our minister
for the wedding?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.060
Don't you think Donny and I

13:48.060 --> 13:49.995
should have a say
in who marries us?

13:49.995 --> 13:50.963
Of course, Daphne.

13:50.963 --> 13:53.332
I'm just whittling down
the possibilities.

13:53.332 --> 13:55.568
The final choice
is yours.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.403
Who's tasting
the first course?

13:57.403 --> 13:58.370
Oh, that'd be me.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.705
Who's that?

13:59.705 --> 14:02.107
That's Chef Marco
from the Mercer Club, Daphne.

14:02.107 --> 14:04.610
Today we'll be sampling
each of our four courses.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.477
No.

14:05.477 --> 14:07.313
I was planning
on serving a buffet.

14:07.313 --> 14:08.814
That way, people can mingle.

14:08.814 --> 14:09.815
It's more festive.

14:09.815 --> 14:10.783
(doorbell rings)

14:10.783 --> 14:14.720
Daphne, we are talking
about your wedding,

14:15.221 --> 14:16.722
not brunch with all the fixin's

14:16.722 --> 14:19.658
at Billy Bob's
Blackjack Boomtown.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.361
Ah.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.863
Hello, Frasier.
You remember Sabrina.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.364
Yes, of course.
Lovely to see you.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.866
Niles, what are
you doing here?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
Oh, we're out for an afternoon
of bird watching.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.803
It's the start
of mating season, you know.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.008
Just wanted to introduce
my new girlfriend to Dad.

14:36.008 --> 14:36.909
Dad, this is Sabrina.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.878
Hi. Nice to meet you.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.379
Nice to meet you, too.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.881
I should really
call my office.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.383
About how long do you
think we'll be gone?

14:44.383 --> 14:45.384
Uh, about eight hours.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.886
Great.

14:51.690 --> 14:54.126
Ooh, Daphne, I didn't know
you were going to be here.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.128
I just want to drop these off
for Frasier.

14:56.128 --> 14:57.630
Oh, Roz, I'm glad
you dropped by.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.632
I need to talk to you
about my wedding.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.400
Do you mind if we speak
in the hallway?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.135
Actually, I don't
have much time.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.637
Well, then, I'll
get right to it.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.705
Excuse me. Do you know
where Dr. Crane lives?

15:07.206 --> 15:08.207
Right here.
Can I help you?

15:08.207 --> 15:10.676
I'm dropping off
this bridesmaid's dress.

15:10.676 --> 15:11.677
Oh, I'll take that.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.978
I'm the bride.
Thanks.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.747
What I need to ask
you is, how do you

15:14.747 --> 15:17.216
ever get Dr. Crane
to listen to you?

15:17.216 --> 15:18.717
Is that
the bridesmaid dress?

15:18.717 --> 15:20.119
He's driving
me mad.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.820
He doesn't listen
to anything I say.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.690
The women you asked to be
bridesmaids get to wear this?

15:24.690 --> 15:26.191
And the worst
part is...

15:26.191 --> 15:27.559
is that silk?
Well, he's just

15:27.559 --> 15:29.428
like my mother--
controlling and stubborn.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.863
I mean, what am I going to do?

15:30.863 --> 15:32.798
Well, Daphne,
it's your wedding.

15:32.798 --> 15:35.734
Just tell Frasier
how you feel.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.636
Well, that's
a bit difficult for me.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.105
You see, there was
no talking to my mother.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.641
Anytime I so much as tried,
all I'd hear is,

15:42.641 --> 15:43.642
"Just do it my way.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.144
You'll thank me later."

15:45.144 --> 15:48.547
Every time she said that,
I just wanted to explode.

15:48.547 --> 15:50.416
Look, Frasier's
a reasonable guy.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.751
Just go in there
and be direct.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.086
You're right.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.988
I'm going to.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.891
Oh, and Roz...

15:58.891 --> 16:00.392
I was going to ask you

16:00.392 --> 16:03.395
if you wanted to be
one of me bridesmaids.

16:03.395 --> 16:04.897
Oh, my God!

16:04.897 --> 16:05.898
Are you serious?!

16:05.898 --> 16:07.299
Yes.

16:07.299 --> 16:11.103
Oh, this is coming
out of nowhere.

16:11.103 --> 16:12.104
I'd love to!

16:12.104 --> 16:13.505
Oh, great.

16:13.505 --> 16:14.340
And don't worry.

16:14.340 --> 16:17.409
Once I'm in charge,
you won't have to wear

16:17.409 --> 16:19.278
this thing Dr. Crane
picked out.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.680
I mean, he calls this
a bridesmaid's dress.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.549
The sleeves aren't even poofy.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.121
So, how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

16:29.121 --> 16:30.556
Well, let's see,
since we've met,

16:30.556 --> 16:35.561
it's been about, uh, 17...
no, 18 hours.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.563
She actually counts
the minutes

16:37.563 --> 16:39.064
we've been together.

16:39.064 --> 16:39.999
FRASIER:
Niles...

16:39.999 --> 16:41.800
may I see you in the kitchen?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.635
Excuse me.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.105
Dr. Crane, I need
to talk to you.

16:46.105 --> 16:46.839
Not now, Daphne.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.207
All right.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.877
All right, what is it?

16:51.877 --> 16:53.846
Niles, it's
about Sabrina.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.815
She's a prostitute.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.653
Frasier, I don't like lawyers
any more than you do.

17:03.555 --> 17:05.391
But frankly,
a man whose face

17:05.391 --> 17:07.226
is plastered
on every bus in town

17:07.226 --> 17:09.694
should be careful what terms
he bandies about.

17:09.694 --> 17:10.996
Oh, Niles, Niles!

17:10.996 --> 17:14.633
Executive Match
is an escort service.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.435
One of Donny's clients
was caught using them.

17:17.435 --> 17:19.271
I don't believe you.

17:19.271 --> 17:23.575
Niles, does Sabrina laugh

17:23.575 --> 17:25.010
at everything
you say?

17:25.010 --> 17:28.914
Is she fascinated by
everything about you?

17:28.914 --> 17:30.783
Even your collections?

17:31.683 --> 17:34.686
Well, yes... actually.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.189
I even showed her
my rarely seen collection

17:37.189 --> 17:41.093
of 18th century
Portuguese bud vases.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.962
And how did she react?

17:43.962 --> 17:47.966
Well, if you must know,
she was rather aroused.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.969
She said she loved a man
who collected porcelain,

17:50.969 --> 17:52.471
and, oh, my God!

17:52.471 --> 17:54.473
I'm dating a whore.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.949
They have
my credit card number.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.451
I've been running up a tab.

18:05.451 --> 18:08.454
I've got to get her
out of here!

18:08.454 --> 18:09.922
Sabrina, we
should be going.

18:09.922 --> 18:10.856
What's the hurry?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.825
We're having a
nice conversation.

18:12.825 --> 18:13.826
Yeah. I love your dad.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.627
Did he mention
he used to be a police officer.

18:15.627 --> 18:16.929
Maybe we should go.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.034
Surely you can
stay a little while.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.802
I... I haven't
seen Niles in ages.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.571
I used to teach him
in Sunday school.

18:25.571 --> 18:26.405
Oh, you know,
Reverend,

18:26.405 --> 18:28.774
I can still remember
dropping him off

18:28.774 --> 18:29.775
for his first class.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.743
Seems like only yesterday.

18:31.743 --> 18:34.179

18:43.088 --> 18:46.825
Oh, Daphne, I believe
I have chosen your bouquet.

18:46.825 --> 18:50.362
It's handwoven
out of pygmy orchids.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.365
Dr. Crane, I really
need to talk to you.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.366
Well, of course.

18:54.366 --> 18:55.868
First, let's sit

18:55.868 --> 18:57.336
and sample the
porcini mushrooms.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.637
They're exquisite.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.339
But I don't like mushrooms.

19:00.339 --> 19:01.840
Oh, you only think you don't.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.675
You haven't tried these. Here.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.511
Dr. Crane, this is really
difficult for me.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.512
Just try this for me.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.013
Come on. You'll
thank me later.

19:08.013 --> 19:10.516
"You'll thank me later"?

19:10.516 --> 19:12.518
I've heard that my whole life.

19:12.518 --> 19:14.520
Well, no more.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.023
I'm doing my wedding my way,

19:18.023 --> 19:20.893
and if that means
I want rice instead of doves

19:20.893 --> 19:24.129
and a DJ instead of a harp,
then that's what I'll have.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.464
I don't want your advice!

19:25.464 --> 19:27.466
I don't want your money!

19:27.466 --> 19:28.967
And I don't want
your mushrooms!

19:28.967 --> 19:31.270
I'm in charge of
 this wedding now.

19:31.270 --> 19:34.072
And what kind of a git
walks down the aisle

19:34.072 --> 19:37.009
carrying something
called pygmy orchids?!

19:37.009 --> 19:39.711
(gasps)

19:39.711 --> 19:43.515
(harp playing "Wedding March")

19:50.422 --> 19:52.925
Is she all right?

19:52.925 --> 19:54.426
She's fine.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.929
We had a nice talk.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.430
That's good.

19:58.430 --> 19:59.765
Wedding still on track?

19:59.765 --> 20:01.433
Absolutely.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.203
You just got a little
carried away, that's all.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
Oh, I guess so,
yeah.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.172
You know, it suddenly
occurred to me

20:07.172 --> 20:08.707
when I was talking to Daphne
that...

20:08.707 --> 20:11.577
I never really got the wedding
of my dreams, either.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.212
Oh, sure,
you know,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.514
my first one,
some little clandestine affair.

20:16.014 --> 20:17.516
We dashed off to City Hall.

20:17.516 --> 20:21.019
Could hardly imagine a wedding
more lacking in ceremony

20:21.019 --> 20:23.522
till my second wedding...

20:23.522 --> 20:26.858
which was lacking a bride.

20:29.461 --> 20:30.729
And then came Lilith.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.231
If I knew then what I know now,

20:32.231 --> 20:35.234
I would have walked down the
aisle with the ice sculpture,

20:35.234 --> 20:38.537
had her stand by the buffet
table to keep the shrimp cold.

20:39.805 --> 20:44.109
Oh, so you had
a few bad weddings.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.413
Guess I was just taking
my last best shot

20:48.413 --> 20:52.251
at the wedding
I will never have for myself.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.619
Oh, come on.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.120
Oh, let's
face it, Dad--

20:55.120 --> 20:57.022
I'm no
spring chicken.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.391
You really see me
getting married again?

20:59.391 --> 21:02.828
Well... I guess
I've had my doubts,

21:02.828 --> 21:06.331
but right here, right now,

21:06.331 --> 21:09.301
I think yeah, you're going
to meet someone.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.235
You really think so?

21:10.235 --> 21:11.470
Yes, I do.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.738
And I'll tell you why.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.774
If Niles can meet
a great gal like Sabrina,

21:15.774 --> 21:18.577
then there's hope for all of us.
