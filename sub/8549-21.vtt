WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:08.876
SO THE MOTHER SAID TO HER SON,
"I WANT YOU TO BE GOOD."

00:08.942 --> 00:12.946
AND THE KID SAID, "I'LL BE GOOD
IF YOU GIVE ME A DOLLAR."

00:13.013 --> 00:14.682
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

00:14.748 --> 00:18.586
SHE SAID, "WHY CAN'T YOU BE GOOD
FOR NOTHING LIKE YOUR FATHER?"

00:31.031 --> 00:32.866
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

00:32.933 --> 00:34.668
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

00:34.735 --> 00:37.738
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

00:37.805 --> 00:41.175
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

00:41.242 --> 00:45.546
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

00:45.613 --> 00:49.117
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

00:49.183 --> 00:53.454
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

00:53.521 --> 00:56.690
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

00:56.757 --> 01:00.761
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:01.729 --> 01:04.898
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:04.965 --> 01:09.103
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:09.170 --> 01:11.805
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:11.872 --> 01:15.976
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:16.043 --> 01:18.879
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:18.946 --> 01:22.483
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:22.550 --> 01:26.754
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AND OPPORTUNITY *

01:26.820 --> 01:29.790
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:29.857 --> 01:34.562
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY **

01:46.006 --> 01:48.075
HURRY UP AND TRY
THE CAKE, MOM.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.644
WE MADE IT
OURSELVES.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.383
MMM.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.859
OH, MY..

02:05.926 --> 02:07.861
YOU LIKE IT, MOM?

02:07.928 --> 02:10.198
LIKE IT?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.833
LIKE ISN'T
THE WORD, HONEY.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.803
THIS CAKE IS
UNBELIEVABLE.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.905
WELL, THERE'S
SOMETHING...

02:17.971 --> 02:19.106
A UNIQUE TASTE...

02:19.173 --> 02:21.209
HORSERADISH.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.412
THAT'S WHY IT CLEARED
MY SINUSES.

02:26.046 --> 02:29.082
MOM, MAKING THE CAKE
WAS MY IDEA.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.051
RICHIE!

02:31.118 --> 02:32.220
WELL, IT WAS.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.388
SO WHAT?
WE MADE IT TOGETHER.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.424
-BUT I THOUGHT OF IT.
-NO, YOU DIDN'T.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.359
-YES, I DID!
-NO, YOU DIDN'T!

02:38.426 --> 02:42.630
-YES, I DID.
-TIME OUT!

02:42.696 --> 02:46.500
RICHIE! YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU JUST
DID WASN'T VERY NICE.

02:46.567 --> 02:47.901
WHY NOT?

02:47.968 --> 02:51.905
BECAUSE HONEY, THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU SHOULD TAKE THE CREDIT

02:51.972 --> 02:54.875
AND THERE ARE OTHER TIMES
WHEN YOU SHOULD SHARE IT.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.646
LET ME GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT
EXAMPLES OF TAKING CREDIT.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.382
NOW, THE FIRST ONE
STARTED TWO WEEKS AGO...

03:05.253 --> 03:07.255
-YOU THINK WE LOST HIM?
-YUP!

03:07.321 --> 03:09.089
WITH ALL THE TWISTS
AND TURNS WE TOOK,

03:09.156 --> 03:11.959
THERE'S NO WAY STEVE COULD'VE
FOLLOWED US HOME.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.395
AAH!
HI, GUYS!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.698
STEVE, HOW'D
YOU BEAT US?

03:17.765 --> 03:21.168
WELL, I JUST CAME
STRAIGHT HERE.

03:21.235 --> 03:25.706
FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, YOU
GUYS WERE RUNNING ALL OVER TOWN.

03:28.509 --> 03:32.212
OH, SIT DOWN. RELAX.
I MADE SOME SANDWICHES.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.648
SINK YOUR GUMS
INTO A BLLT.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.251
WHAT'S A BLLT?

03:37.318 --> 03:39.553
BACON, LETTUCE,
AND LIVER TARTAR.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.621
UGH!

03:45.158 --> 03:46.760
-HI, KIDS.
-HI, MOM.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.664
YOU...ARE
AN AMAZING WOMAN.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.367
I AM?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.702
ABSOLUTELY.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.004
SOMEHOW, YOU MANAGE
TO KEEP A SPOTLESS HOME,

03:57.070 --> 03:58.539
HOLD DOWN
A TAXING JOB,

03:58.606 --> 04:01.575
AND KEEP YOUR FRIDGE
WELL STOCKED WITH LIVER.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.811
AND YOU DO IT ALL
SO EFFORTLESSLY,

04:03.877 --> 04:06.447
WITH NO VISIBLE STRAIN
OTHER THAN A DROOPY EXPRESSION

04:06.514 --> 04:08.916
AND SLIGHT BAGS
UNDER YOUR EYES.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.723
THANK YOU
EVER SO MUCH.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.159
EDDIE,
LOOK AT THIS.

04:19.226 --> 04:22.663
"ENTER THE CHICAGO CHRONICLE
SHORT STORY CONTEST."

04:22.730 --> 04:24.898
YEAH. NOW LOOK, THEY'RE
GONNA SELECT FIVE WINNERS

04:24.965 --> 04:27.735
IN EACH AGE CATEGORY,
YOU SHOULD ENTER, EDDIE.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.205
WHY?

04:32.272 --> 04:35.809
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
WRITING TALENT.

04:35.876 --> 04:36.944
I DO?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.513
HE DOES?
HE DOES?

04:40.614 --> 04:41.682
YES.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.151
ED,YOU KNOW HOW PROUD
WE ALL WERE OF YOU

04:44.217 --> 04:47.220
WHEN YOU GOT A-PLUS IN ENGLISH
ON YOUR LAST REPORT CARD.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.523
PROUD? HMM.
I WAS DUMFOUNDED.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.560
SO WAS EDDIE'S TEACHER.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.429
SHE CALLED ME TO TELL
ME HOW MUCH YOUR THEME PAPERS

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
HAD IMPROVED.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.832
EDDIE?

05:00.468 --> 05:01.702
EDDIE WINSLOW?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.874
THIS EDDIE WINSLOW?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.543
OH, LORD, I'VE FALLEN INTO
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE,

05:09.610 --> 05:12.546
AND I CAN'T GET UP.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.451
EDDIE, I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.753
I CAN'T WAIT TO READ
YOUR SHORT STORY.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.855
B-B-BUT, MOM...

05:23.290 --> 05:24.925
-STEVE?
-SAY NO MORE, EDDO.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.595
I'LL START WRITING THE PAPER
THIS VERY EVE.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.964
-THANKS, BUDDY.
-WAIT A MINUTE.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.901
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING
EDDIE'S ENGLISH PAPERS?

05:33.967 --> 05:36.203
NOT "DOING," EXACTLY.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.638
MORE LIKE...

05:37.705 --> 05:39.540
HELPING.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.275
EXACTLY HOW MUCH
DID YOU HELP?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.446
WELL, I MERELY CAME
UP WITH AN IDEA,

05:45.513 --> 05:49.216
AND THEN I WROTE DOWN
THE ACTUAL WORDS.

05:49.282 --> 05:52.386
I DID THE REST.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.556
WELL, YOU JUST
MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.190
IS HE PAYING YOU
FOR THIS?

05:57.257 --> 05:59.427
I'M GETTING SOMETHING FAR MORE
PRECIOUS THAN MONEY.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.161
FRIENDSHIP.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.864
YOU SEE, EDDIE AND RODNEY
ARE GOING CAMPING NEXT MONTH.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.934
AND HE SAID IF I HELP THEM OUT,
HE'D TAKE ME ALONG.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.137
WAIT A MINUTE, STEVE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY
EDDIE'S FRIENDSHIP.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.872
NO, I'M NOT.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.976
I'M LEASING WITH
AN OPTION TO BUY.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.817
NOW, LET'S START THE OTHER
EXAMPLE OF TAKING CREDIT.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.253
THAT VERY NIGHT,
YOUR UNCLE CARL
AND HIS BOSS

06:26.319 --> 06:27.688
WERE WORKING
ON A STAKEOUT.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.723
WERE THEY WORKING HARD?

06:29.790 --> 06:31.391
OH, YES.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.494
VERY HARD.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.696
DOUGHNUT, SIR?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.003
-WINSLOW?
-YES, SIR?

06:43.070 --> 06:46.607
WILL YOU FIND A LOCATION A
LITTLE CLOSER TO THE WAREHOUSE?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.213
UH, SIR...

06:53.280 --> 06:55.849
YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH THE WRONG
END OF THE BINOCULARS.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.724
I KNEW THAT.

07:03.791 --> 07:07.094
JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU WERE ON YOUR TOES.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.530
SIR, WHEN DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL MAKE THEIR MOVE?

07:09.597 --> 07:10.998
HARD TO TELL.

07:11.064 --> 07:14.768
SOMETIMES A DOUGHNUT WILL STAY
INSIDE ME FOR A FULL WEEK.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.909
NO, SIR. I WAS REFERRING
TO THE SUSPECTS, SIR.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.477
OH.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.180
HARD TO TELL.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.816
YOU KNOW
THESE SLIMEBALLS

07:28.882 --> 07:30.918
ARE SELLING COMPUTERS
TO OUR NATION'S ENEMIES?

07:35.556 --> 07:39.026
YOU KNOW...

07:39.092 --> 07:40.961
I LIKE YOU, WINSLOW.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.002
YOU DO, SIR?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.804
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.573
STEADY
UNDER PRESSURE.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.543
WELL... THANK YOU, SIR.
I TRY.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.110
I'VE STUDIED
YOUR RECORD.

07:57.177 --> 08:01.649
I KNOW YOU LIKE I KNOW
THE BACK OF MY HAND.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.316
WELL, I'M FLATTERED, SIR.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.753
I'VE MET YOUR LOVELY
WIFE HANNAH...

08:09.056 --> 08:11.024
HARRIETTE, SIR.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.527
YOUR SON, EDMUND...

08:13.594 --> 08:17.264
EDWARD, SIR.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.467
YOUR DAUGHTER, LESLIE.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.269
LAURA.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.708
AND YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW
RACHEL.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.743
-RACHEL, SIR.
-THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.845
OH.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.013
YES, IT IS.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.051
RACHEL'S VERY...

08:38.118 --> 08:40.187
PRETTY.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.760
MAYBE I'LL GIVE HER
A CALL SOMETIME.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.632
HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE FEELS ABOUT ME?

08:57.470 --> 08:59.973
WELL, I--I--I--
I'M SURE

09:00.040 --> 09:03.043
THAT RACHEL FEELS
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY...

09:03.110 --> 09:05.045
THAT I DO, SIR.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.215
EXCELLENT.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.086
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
WE'RE ON DUTY HERE,

09:13.153 --> 09:17.424
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD BE
ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.593
THAT OKAY WITH YOU,
KEVIN?

09:24.031 --> 09:25.332
UH, CARL, SIR.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.902
FINE.

09:34.107 --> 09:37.310
SIR, I DON'T BELIEVE
I KNOW YOUR FIRST NAME.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.979
IT'S LIEUTENANT.

09:41.548 --> 09:42.983
EXCUSE ME?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.952
I HAD MY FIRST NAME
LEGALLY CHANGED

09:45.018 --> 09:47.888
WHEN I ACHIEVED
MY PRESENT RANK.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.990
SIR, WHAT
WAS YOUR NAME BEFORE?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.725
SERGEANT.

09:53.927 --> 09:54.995
GOTCHA.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.737
CAN I COUNT ON YOU
TO BE DISCREET, KEITH?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.743
CARL, SIR.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.278
AND CERTAINLY.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.482
I NEED THIS BUST.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.751
YOU DO? WHY?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.386
CAPTAIN DAVENPORT'S
OUT TO GET ME.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.789
REALLY? BUT SIR, I ALWAYS
THOUGHT CAPTAIN DAVENPORT--

10:21.855 --> 10:23.623
HE'S JEALOUS OF ME.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.660
HE KNOWS I'M BETTER QUALIFIED
FOR HIS JOB THAN HE IS.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.763
AND HE'S TOO INSECURE
TO ADMIT IT.

10:29.830 --> 10:34.768
AND...ONE DAY, HE CAUGHT ME
WEARING HIS UNIFORM.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.006
WHAT?

10:39.072 --> 10:42.876
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW I
LOOKED WITH CAPTAIN'S BARS.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.978
BUT DAVENPORT THREW
A HISSY FIT...

10:45.045 --> 10:49.382
SAID THERE WAS NO ROOM ON THE
FORCE FOR A GUNG-HO LUNATIC.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.752
BUT IF I MAKE
THIS BUST...

10:53.120 --> 10:55.355
I'LL BE
HIGH-PROFILE.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.690
A HERO.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.162
THE COMMISSIONER
WILL TAKE NOTICE.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.997
THEN YOU CAN WEAR
HIS UNIFORM.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.065
WHAT?

11:05.132 --> 11:06.800
NOTHING, SIR.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.808
YOU KNOW, KYLE...

11:18.645 --> 11:20.513
ALL MY LIFE,

11:20.580 --> 11:23.116
ALL I'VE WANTED
IS TO BE A GOOD COP.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.684
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.722
AND A PORSCHE.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.924
I WANT A PORSCHE.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.497
MEANWHILE, STEVE WENT AHEAD
AND WROTE A SHORT STORY

11:37.564 --> 11:38.799
FOR EDDIE.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.233
10 DAYS LATER,
GUESS WHAT.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.804
DO YOU BELIEVE IT?
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

11:43.871 --> 11:46.974
I'M DUMBFOUNDED.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.176
WHAT'S ALL
THE EXCITEMENT?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.745
-EDDIE!
-OH...

11:51.812 --> 11:54.281
YOU DID IT!
YOU DID IT!

11:54.347 --> 11:56.049
DID WHAT?

11:56.116 --> 11:58.485
YOU WON FIRST PLACE IN
THE SHORT STORY CONTEST!

12:11.531 --> 12:15.302
MOM, I THOUGHT UNCLE STEVE
WON THE STORY CONTEST.

12:15.368 --> 12:18.705
OH, HE DID, BUT AT FIRST,
EDDIE TOOK CREDIT FOR IT.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.507
DID HE FESS UP?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.942
WELL, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.944
YOUR MOM AND GRANDMOM
WERE SO EXCITED,

12:24.011 --> 12:26.279
THEY COULD HARDLY
CONTAIN THEMSELVES.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.649
COME ON. LET'S GO SPREAD THE
NEWS. I'M DYING TO BRAG.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.452
ME, TOO.
AND HELEN WINTERS,

12:32.519 --> 12:34.888
ALWAYS FLAPPING HER GUMS
ABOUT HER GRANDDAUGHTER

12:34.955 --> 12:37.224
BEING A TV WRITER.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.892
WAIT TILL I TELL HER

12:38.959 --> 12:41.461
MY GRANDSON
IS A REAL WRITER.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.030
YEAH!

12:49.903 --> 12:53.040
WOW, FIRST PRIZE!

12:53.807 --> 12:55.075
MM-HMM.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.046
HELLO, EDDO.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.149
OH, LAURA, MY LOVE...
THE WIND'S CHAPPED MY LIPS.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.985
WOULD YOU CARE
TO HEAL THEM WITH A KISS?

13:07.687 --> 13:09.823
TELL HIM, EDDIE.
TELL ME WHAT?

13:11.258 --> 13:13.493
YOUR SHORT STORY
WON FIRST PRIZE, STEVE.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.228
GEE, NO KIDDING.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.396
LET ME SEE.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.636
"CONGRATULATIONS,"
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

13:23.703 --> 13:26.974
"YOU'RE EXTREMELY
TALENTED," BLAH, BLAH, BLAH...

13:28.575 --> 13:29.877
OOH, LISTEN
TO THIS PART!

13:29.943 --> 13:32.745
"THE JUDGES UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
YOUR SHORT STORY,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.882
"IN SEARCH
OF A DREAM,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.183
"BECAUSE OF ITS
INSPIRING DEPICTION

13:36.249 --> 13:38.485
OF A YOUNG
PROCTOLOGIST."

13:39.619 --> 13:41.254
NOT BAD!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.190
IT'S FANTASTIC, STEVE.
THE PROBLEM IS,

13:43.256 --> 13:45.192
IT'S YOUR STORY,
NOT EDDIE'S.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.827
WELL, I CAME UP
WITH THE TITLE.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.199
WELL, LAURA, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE GLORY.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.068
BESIDES, THE WHOLE THING
WILL BE GOOD FOR A LAUGH

13:55.135 --> 13:57.670
WHEN US GUYS ARE SITTING
AROUND THE OLD CAMPFIRE

13:57.737 --> 14:00.573
CHEWING OUR BAZOOKA,
RIGHT, EDDIE?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.478
RIGHT, EDDIE?

14:05.545 --> 14:08.115
UH...NOT EXACTLY, STEVE.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.118
YOU SEE,
THERE'S A MINOR SNAFU

14:11.184 --> 14:12.852
REGARDING
THE CAMPING TRIP.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.354
SNAFU?

14:15.855 --> 14:19.659
YEAH. YOU SEE, WHEN I TOLD
RODNEY ABOUT YOU GOING WITH US,

14:19.726 --> 14:22.029
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
A TERRIBLE IDEA.

14:22.095 --> 14:26.233
OH, TYPICAL, BUT YOU STOOD UP
FOR ME. RIGHT BUDDY?

14:28.835 --> 14:30.470
WELL, STEVE, I TRIED.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.806
BUT RODNEY SAID I HAD
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.543
I SEE. AND YOU CHOSE RODNEY.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.582
I'M SORRY, STEVE.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.085
WE'LL GO CAMPING TOGETHER
SOME OTHER TIME...

14:45.152 --> 14:48.221
JUST YOU AND ME.
I PROMISE, OKAY?

14:48.288 --> 14:49.489
OKAY.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.890
ALRIGHT.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.294
NO, IT'S NOT OKAY!

14:58.365 --> 15:01.001
EDDIE WINSLOW,
FRONT AND CENTER!

15:04.504 --> 15:06.506
NEWS FLASH, EDDIE.

15:06.573 --> 15:11.011
I HAVE FEELINGS.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.880
INSIDE
THIS SCRAWNY CHEST,
THERE BEATS A HEART--

15:13.947 --> 15:16.149
A HEART THAT HURTS.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.650
AND THE REASON IT HURTS

15:17.717 --> 15:20.620
IS BECAUSE I'VE TRIED VERY HARD
TO BE YOUR FRIEND,

15:20.687 --> 15:23.256
AND ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.393
WELL, THAT'S GOING
TO STOP RIGHT NOW.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.533
I'M NOT YOUR
PERSONAL DOORMAT.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.535
I'M HER DOORMAT.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.910
-STEVE, LISTEN--
-NO, YOU LISTEN.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.412
EITHER YOU
TAKE ME CAMPING

15:45.478 --> 15:49.182
OR TELL EVERYBODY WHO REALLY
WON THE SHORT STORY CONTEST.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.384
-IS THIS A BLUFF?
-TRY ME.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.822
ALRIGHT. I'M GONNA
GO TELL MY MOM

15:55.888 --> 15:58.658
THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING MY
ENGLISH PAPERS FOR ME.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.828
AND TRUTH IS STEVE, I HAVE
BEEN FEELING GUILTY

16:01.894 --> 16:03.596
ABOUT TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF YOU,

16:03.663 --> 16:05.965
SO I'M GONNA GO CALL
RODNEY RIGHT NOW

16:06.033 --> 16:07.500
AND TELL HIM YOU'RE
GOING CAMPING

16:07.567 --> 16:10.070
WHETHER HE LIKES IT
OR NOT.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.705
-THANKS, EDDIE.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:12.772 --> 16:16.043
EDDIE?
YEAH?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.252
WELL, UM...YEAH.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.655
HOW ABOUT
THOSE BEARS?

16:30.323 --> 16:33.493
AUNT RACHEL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY DAD AND HIS CRAZY BOSS?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.729
WELL, THAT VERY NIGHT,
THEY WERE ON A STAKEOUT

16:36.796 --> 16:39.232
FOR THE 10th NIGHT
IN A ROW.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.339
78. A NEW
PERSONAL BEST.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.776
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:51.711 --> 16:54.081
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO GIVE HER ANOTHER TRY?

16:54.147 --> 16:57.184
NO, THANKS.
MY NOSE STILL HURTS.

16:58.385 --> 17:03.056
-YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?
-A CAREER CHANGE?

17:03.123 --> 17:05.158
NO.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.829
SOME ITALIAN FOOD.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.831
THERE'S A PLACE
DOWN THE STREET.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.067
GREAT EGGPLANT
PARMESAN.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.368
OH...WELL, SIR...

17:15.435 --> 17:17.737
EGGPLANT IS GREAT,
BUT, UM...

17:17.804 --> 17:19.206
ACCORDING TO REGULATIONS,

17:19.272 --> 17:21.074
A STAKEOUT TEAM
SHOULD NEVER SEPARATE.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.575
DON'T QUOTE REGULATIONS
TO ME, WINSLOW.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.345
I HELPED WRITE THE
DAMN REGULATIONS.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.415
IT'S UP TO ME IF I WANT
TO VIOLATE MYSELF.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.660
NO WONDER THE CRIMINALS
ARE WINNING.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.083
BAKER 1, THIS IS
CHARLIE 2! COME IN!

18:04.151 --> 18:07.053
WHAT DO YOU WANT, CARL?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.521
LOU! LOU!
IT'S GOING DOWN NOW!

18:08.588 --> 18:10.723
WHAT? YOU WANT US
TO GRAB THEM?

18:10.790 --> 18:17.197
NO, LET ME GET SOME PICTURES,
AND THEN I'LL GIVE THE WORD.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.866
ALRIGHT.
ALRIGHT.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.171
ALRIGHT.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.373
TRUCK.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
COMPUTERS.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.779
GOTCHA.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.549
HAH. SUSPECTS.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.052
OKAY. OPEN UP
THE BRIEFCASE.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.121
COME ON,
OPEN UP THE BRIEFCASE.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.957
SHOW HIM THE MONEY.
THAT'S IT.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.426
HAH.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.730
TOO BAD I CAN SEE YOU
AND YOU CAN'T SEE ME.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.766
I FORGOT TO ASK YOU ABOUT
DESSERT. YOU WANT A CANNOLI?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.768
LIEUTENANT, KILL THE LIGHTS!

19:03.910 --> 19:07.180
LOU! NOW! GO! GO! GO!

19:09.549 --> 19:10.950
KEN, YOU
COULD'VE WARNED ME!

19:11.017 --> 19:13.353
[SIREN]

19:19.792 --> 19:22.529
-LIEUTENANT MAYTAG--
-THAT'S MURTAGH.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.897
M-U-R...TAGH.

19:27.534 --> 19:31.804
GOT IT. WHAT KIND OF COMPUTERS
WERE THE SUSPECTS SELLING?

19:32.305 --> 19:34.140
COMPUTERS.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.844
WELL...THE COMPUTERS
WERE, UM...

19:38.511 --> 19:40.413
DUH...

19:40.480 --> 19:41.914
UM...

19:41.981 --> 19:44.884
THEY WERE THE HIGH-POWER,
HIGH-CAPACITY COMPUTERS

19:44.951 --> 19:47.387
OF THE TYPE USED BY
THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.489
LIEUTENANT, HAVE YOU
DETERMINED WHAT COUNTRY

19:49.556 --> 19:51.324
THE COMPUTERS
WERE BEING SOLD TO?

19:51.391 --> 19:54.727
OH. WELL,
THE, UM...

19:54.794 --> 19:56.463
OH, UM...

19:58.498 --> 19:59.532
UM...

20:02.335 --> 20:05.171
UH, NOT AS OF YET, BUT WE DO
KNOW THE DESTINATION

20:05.238 --> 20:07.874
WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

20:10.477 --> 20:14.681
SERGEANT WINSLOW, WHY ARE YOU
SUPPLYING ALL THE ANSWERS?

20:14.747 --> 20:17.850
WELL, THE LIEUTENANT HERE
IS A MODEST MAN...

20:17.917 --> 20:20.653
BUT HE PLANNED AND EXECUTED
THIS ENTIRE OPERATION,

20:20.720 --> 20:23.155
AND I AM PROUD
TO WORK UNDER LIEUTENANT

20:23.222 --> 20:25.858
LIEUTENANT MURTAGH.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.860
THANK YOU,
GENTLEMEN.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.135
WELL, IT'S OVER.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.271
GOOD BUST.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.207
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET
A COMMENDATION.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.776
AND I JUST MIGHT GET
MY PROMOTION.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.949
CARL...

20:50.016 --> 20:52.652
YES, SIR?

20:52.719 --> 20:56.923
YOU NOT ONLY COVERED FOR ME,
YOU GAVE ME THE CREDIT.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.425
WHY?

20:58.491 --> 21:01.694
WELL, SIR, IT REALLY DOESN'T
MATTER WHO DID WHAT.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.130
I MEAN, YOU WENT OUT
TO GET US EGGPLANT,

21:04.196 --> 21:05.765
I STAYED HERE
AND DUCKED BULLETS.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.767
IT BALANCES OUT.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.771
NO, IT DOESN'T.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.242
I MESSED UP, BIG TIME.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.478
A LOT OF GUYS WOULD'VE
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT

21:18.545 --> 21:20.447
AND HOGGED
ALL THE GLORY.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.383
INSTEAD...YOU
SHARED IT WITH ME.

21:24.517 --> 21:27.019
WELL, SIR,
THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

21:27.086 --> 21:29.021
WE'RE A TEAM.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.291
THANK YOU.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.293
YOU'RE WELCOME,
SIR.

21:44.837 --> 21:45.972
SO YOU SEE, HONEY

21:46.038 --> 21:48.808
THERE ARE TIMES YOU HAVE
TO STAND UP FOR YOURSELF

21:48.875 --> 21:50.276
LIKE UNCLE STEVE DID.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.644
AND THERE ARE TIMES,

21:51.711 --> 21:54.280
WHEN IT'S REALLY NICE
TO SHARE THE CREDIT.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.816
THE WAY UNCLE CARL DID?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.485
EXACTLY.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.988
JUDY, I'M SORRY THAT
I HOGGED ALL THE CREDIT.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.391
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE YOUNG.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.258
OKAY.
GIVE ME A HUG.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.561
YOU TWO GO ON UPSTAIRS
AND HOP INTO BED.

22:08.628 --> 22:11.163
AND I'LL COME
TUCK YOU IN, IN A MINUTE.

22:11.230 --> 22:12.665
OKAY.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.013
WHOA! NOBODY SHOULD
TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.015
THIS CAKE
COULD KILL YA.
