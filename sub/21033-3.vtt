<i>Are you eating soup?</i>

00:07.000 --> 00:08.124
(SLURPS) No.

00:08.124 --> 00:09.416
<i>That's a new suit,</i>

00:09.416 --> 00:11.582
<i>It hasn't been</i>

(MOCKINGLY)
Egghead!

00:24.416 --> 00:26.499
No, I'm in the middle
of lunch.

00:28.874 --> 00:30.499
(LAUGHING)
So predictable.

00:30.499 --> 00:32.124
Predictable?
I don't even know... Whoa!

00:32.707 --> 00:33.915
Fry him!

(GROWLING)

00:50.124 --> 00:51.208
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

00:51.915 --> 00:52.915

(SIGHS)

01:17.374 --> 01:19.374
<i>Looks like we need to do</i>

01:19.374 --> 01:20.499
<i>You got lucky, Scott.</i>

01:20.499 --> 01:21.915
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

<i>Enjoy your soup time.</i>
