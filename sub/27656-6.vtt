00:04.805 --> 00:06.972
- You don't need to
swing your candy around.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.273
Just keep it low.

00:08.275 --> 00:09.775
Maybe tuck it in your
sweater a little bit.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.143
- Are we not allowed to
bring in our own candy?

00:12.145 --> 00:14.279
- Well, there's
no official rule,

00:14.281 --> 00:15.947
but ya know, they sell
their own candy here.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.417
So, they might not love
us bringing our own in.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.985
- Yeah honey, let Mommy
hold it in her purse.

00:19.987 --> 00:20.952
- That's a good idea.

00:20.954 --> 00:21.820
- [Girl] OK.

00:21.822 --> 00:22.554
- Thank you.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.824
Oh hey, isn't that um,

00:25.826 --> 00:27.393
Elizabeth's husband, Eric?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.228
- [Man] Who's Elizabeth?

00:29.230 --> 00:30.562
- Amelia's teacher's
aid, ya know,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.398
we met em at the book fair.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.632
- Oh yeah.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.766
- And he was applying
to law school.

00:34.768 --> 00:35.367
- Yeah, he was
asking me about oil.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.367
- Exactly.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.369
I wonder if Elizabeth's here.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.476
Uh, no, she is not here.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.879
That is not Elizabeth.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.580
- Are you sure that's Eric?

00:48.582 --> 00:50.616
- Mmhmm, 100%.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.151
OK it's noon and
that man has already

00:53.153 --> 00:54.419
been inside her today, right?

00:54.421 --> 00:55.754
- Yeah, I think a couple times.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.990
- Jesus, OK, bubs, come on.

00:57.992 --> 00:58.824
- [Associate] Tickets.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.092
- Thank you.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.326
- [Associate] Thank you.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.794
- Can I have my candy
in your purse now?

01:02.796 --> 01:05.664
- Just wait until we're further
in the theater, come on.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.398
- Why?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.199
- Just keep walking.

01:08.201 --> 01:10.335
When do they start being cool?

01:10.337 --> 01:11.403
- Unclear.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.906
(upbeat music)

01:28.221 --> 01:29.621
- What am I supposed to do?

01:29.623 --> 01:32.091
Am I supposed to say
something to Elizabeth now?

01:32.093 --> 01:33.558
- I really don't know.

01:33.560 --> 01:37.496
- I mean, it's one thing if
it's one of my best friends,

01:37.498 --> 01:39.431
if it's Jennifer or Kyle,
obviously I'd say something,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.166
but I barely know this woman.

01:41.168 --> 01:44.036
I'm gonna tell her that her
husband is cheating on her?

01:44.038 --> 01:45.337
- If it was me, honestly,

01:45.339 --> 01:47.706
I don't even think I
would say something

01:47.708 --> 01:50.275
'cause you could possibly
be ending their marriage.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.677
- I'm not ending their marriage.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.679
It's Eric's constant
whipped cream on the nipples

01:54.681 --> 01:57.116
level of effing that is
gonna end the marriage.

01:57.118 --> 01:58.751
- Is it her nipples
or her nipples?

01:58.753 --> 02:00.653
- All the nipples
Mike, trust me.

02:00.655 --> 02:03.455
They're all covered in
whipped cream and sweat.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.923
- Chill man, I'm
eating this yogurt.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.658
- You know what, I think I
actually would wanna know

02:06.660 --> 02:08.093
especially if I was her age.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.729
She's ya know, she's young,
she doesn't have kids yet.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.132
She has a career, like she
can do whatever she wants.

02:13.134 --> 02:14.466
She doesn't need this.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.300
- No, you're right, that's true.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.601
She should know now.

02:16.603 --> 02:18.670
- I think I'm just gonna
tell her that I saw Eric

02:18.672 --> 02:20.939
at the movies with
someone and then,

02:20.941 --> 02:24.309
if that peaks her interest,
she can investigate further.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.144
- Question for you.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.078
- [Woman] Yeah?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.346
- Since you're my best friend,

02:27.348 --> 02:29.281
would you tell me if I
was being cheated on?

02:29.283 --> 02:30.716
- No, I would tell Jennifer.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.017
- Why?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.352
- Because she's my best friend.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.086
- I'm not your best friend?

02:35.088 --> 02:37.556
- No, I mean, I love you but,

02:37.558 --> 02:38.824
you're not my best friend.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.326
I'm not really your
best friend, am I?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.626
- Of course.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.830
- Oof, that is
embarrassing for you.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.864
- Often, it is.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.168
- This is why you're
not my best friend.

02:49.170 --> 02:50.436
Stuff like this.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.539
Now I'm not putting
yogurt on your nipples.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.073
Sorry.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.308
(crunching)

02:56.310 --> 02:58.944
Not today, Mike, not today.

02:59.814 --> 03:02.281
(upbeat music)

03:06.754 --> 03:08.253
- Come on.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.355
That's so sweet.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.556
- Is it?

03:10.558 --> 03:12.123
- Yeah.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.459
I don't know why you're so
weird about Mr. Castellotti.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.061
I mean, he's great
with those kids.

03:16.063 --> 03:19.198
- Sure, for a 70s cop who
plays by his own rules.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.966
- Is he a cop who
plays by his own rule

03:20.968 --> 03:23.468
or a cop who does
stuff by the book?

03:23.470 --> 03:25.604
- Eh, actually
probably by the book.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.874
That stache is all about
those Miranda rights,

03:28.876 --> 03:29.808
you know what I'm sayin'?

03:29.810 --> 03:30.675
- Yes.

03:30.677 --> 03:31.543
- You do?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.411
- Yes and no.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.278
- Which part no?

03:33.280 --> 03:34.479
- I don't understand the stache

03:34.481 --> 03:35.347
reading Miranda
rights to somebody.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.015
- So his mustache

03:37.017 --> 03:38.283
has the capac--
(bell ringing)

03:38.285 --> 03:39.150
Oh, my God!

03:39.152 --> 03:40.019
- I understand.

03:40.021 --> 03:41.553
- Oh my God, alright smushy,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.222
don't forget that Grampy's
picking you up today.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.758
You got your big
sleepover tonight!

03:45.760 --> 03:47.760
- Grampy lets me have
ice cream in bed.

03:47.762 --> 03:49.428
- Well sounds like you're
gonna have a pretty good night.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.162
- [Girl] Yeah!

03:50.164 --> 03:50.996
- Bye smooch!

03:52.767 --> 03:54.299
Hey! Elizabeth!

03:54.301 --> 03:55.500
- Oh hey Andrea!

03:55.502 --> 03:56.501
- Oh my God.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.369
- How are you?

03:57.371 --> 03:58.671
- I'm good, I'm good.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.973
You know what, I think
I saw you on Saturday.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.442
Were you at the movies?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.577
- I wish, I was in Santa Barbara

04:05.579 --> 04:09.214
with my mom visiting a TV that
she is considering buying.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.582
I wish that were a joke.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.985
- Huh, 'cause I saw Eric
in the concession stand

04:13.987 --> 04:15.054
standing with a blonde.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.256
Mike and I just
assumed it was you but,

04:17.258 --> 04:22.161
I guess it doesn't matter
because it wasn't you.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.596
- He always does fun
stuff when I'm outta town.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.199
Well, I wish that it had been me

04:27.201 --> 04:29.435
because I would've
loved to have seen you.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.537
- I would have loved
to have seen you too.

04:32.740 --> 04:37.676
But I guess hello
now and um, goodbye.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.410
- Have a great day!

04:38.412 --> 04:39.544
- You too!

04:39.546 --> 04:41.613
And we'll see you soon.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.082
- [Elizabeth] Bye!

04:43.084 --> 04:44.249
(jazzy music)

04:44.251 --> 04:45.550
- I mean, I did my part.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.685
I got the ball rolling.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.552
- You did.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.455
- Oh, this is gonna horrify you.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.956
Elizabeth said, quote,

04:50.958 --> 04:53.826
"He always does fun stuff
when I'm out of town."

04:53.828 --> 04:56.227
Eric is garbage.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.696
- Jesus.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.230
- Just makes me so annoyed
that he is just out there

04:59.232 --> 05:01.700
doing this to her
and she has no clue!

05:01.702 --> 05:03.669
- Did it seem like what
you said registered at all?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.304
- I don't know,
I don't think so,

05:05.306 --> 05:08.107
but at least I did what
I said I was gonna do

05:08.109 --> 05:09.708
and I put the ball in her court.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.676
- Wait, did you get
the ball rolling

05:10.678 --> 05:12.911
or did ya put it in her court?

05:12.913 --> 05:15.714
- Uh actually, ya
know what, I did both.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.851
I gently rolled the
ball onto her court.

05:19.453 --> 05:19.718
- OK, great.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.520
- Yeah.

05:21.522 --> 05:21.620
- What kinda balls do
you roll on a court?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.323
- Whatever balls
you want except two.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.725
I rarely roll your
balls onto any court.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.128
I mean, obviously, there
are special occasions.

05:29.130 --> 05:30.462
- There are?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.798
- My point is, Elizabeth
now has the information.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.999
She can do with
it what she will.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.934
- You're right.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.936
Ya know, with Amelia at
your father's house--

05:37.938 --> 05:39.104
- Yeah?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.506
- We have an opportunity
to do some naked stuff.

05:40.508 --> 05:43.108
- Oh, I like naked stuff.

05:43.110 --> 05:43.942
- Perfect.

05:45.146 --> 05:47.146
- Do you think this is
one of those special

05:47.148 --> 05:49.948
ball rolling occasions
I was referring to?

05:49.950 --> 05:50.816
- I think it might be.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.717
- Yeah?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.084
Get out your tennis racket.

05:53.086 --> 05:53.852
Let's do this.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.755
(phone vibrating)

05:56.757 --> 05:58.223
Oh, that's my dad.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.759
Hey dad, is everything alright?

06:00.761 --> 06:03.495
- Uh yeah, everything's fine.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.899
Amelia might not
wanna spend the night.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.702
- OK, should we come over?

06:09.704 --> 06:11.737
- Um, yeah, I think you should.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.138
- Uh, alright.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.173
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

06:14.175 --> 06:15.907
- [Dad] Make it like 15.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.509
- OK, there's a certain
amount of time it takes

06:17.511 --> 06:18.910
for me to get to your house.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.646
- Understood but just
quickly as you could, k?

06:21.115 --> 06:21.980
- OK.

06:21.982 --> 06:22.848
- [Dad] OK, bye.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.649
- Bye.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.520
Alright well, Amelia
wants to get picked up.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.755
- OK, she alright?

06:29.757 --> 06:32.358
- Yeah, apologize to
your balls for me.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.593
- Sorry, from Andrea.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.161
- Don't say it's from me.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.597
Now they're gonna be weird
the next time I see them.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.866
Just be cool.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.602
(upbeat music)

06:43.604 --> 06:44.536
Bub, it's not a big deal.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.937
We'll just go home, OK?

06:45.939 --> 06:46.872
- OK.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.173
- I'll just get ya in the car.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.741
- Alright, I'll be right out.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.342
OK.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.411
Dad, what happened?

06:52.413 --> 06:53.678
- We had a great time.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.813
She had ice cream in bed.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.681
We went to sleep, no problem.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.752
And then she apparently
woke up at some point

06:59.754 --> 07:02.755
and came in to ask
for a glass of water

07:02.757 --> 07:04.423
and walked in on Bonnie and I--

07:04.425 --> 07:05.356
- Oh God.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.225
- Making love.

07:06.227 --> 07:06.959
(groans)

07:06.961 --> 07:07.959
Yeah, I know, I know.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.360
I know, I know.

07:09.362 --> 07:14.033
- OK, how much of your
love making did she see?

07:14.035 --> 07:15.100
- Not much.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.802
I mean, we stopped immediately.

07:16.804 --> 07:17.969
- Immediately, yeah.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.170
- I would hope so.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.505
- It was very dimly lit.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.307
You could barely see
- Dad!

07:22.309 --> 07:23.174
- your own hand.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.043
- I don't understand.

07:24.045 --> 07:25.244
You knew she was in the house.

07:25.246 --> 07:28.213
You couldn't control
yourself for one night?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.249
- I'm a sexual being.

07:30.251 --> 07:33.652
- OK, OK, OK.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.987
- Andrea, I am so sorry.

07:35.989 --> 07:39.024
- No Bonnie, it's
fine, things happen.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.794
I'm just sorry that I now have
to explain sex to my daughter

07:42.796 --> 07:45.264
because her grandfather
is a sexual being.

07:45.266 --> 07:46.598
- Well why don't you
tell her it's just like

07:46.600 --> 07:48.033
a train going into a tunnel.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.236
- I'm sorry, I thought
you said you stopped.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.639
There was a train to witness?

07:53.641 --> 07:55.641
And also, the tunnel?

07:55.643 --> 07:57.008
- She just saw my back.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.144
She may not have
even known it was me.

08:00.281 --> 08:04.083
- If it wasn't you,
who would it have been?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.017
- An intruder.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.653
- So to be clear,
you want me to say

08:07.655 --> 08:09.354
and intruder broke
into the house

08:09.356 --> 08:11.056
and sexually assaulted Bonnie?

08:11.058 --> 08:12.624
- No, no.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.626
You know, we didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

08:14.628 --> 08:15.894
- Obviously.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.228
- We had no intention of
being intimate tonight

08:17.230 --> 08:18.664
and then Bonnie just
started initiating.

08:18.666 --> 08:22.034
- OK, thank you so much
for watching my daughter.

08:22.036 --> 08:22.901
- Anytime.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.437
- No.

08:25.439 --> 08:26.839
- Hm, well that's fair.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.243
(cheery music)

08:31.245 --> 08:32.845
- Ah, so, how'd it go?

08:32.847 --> 08:36.781
- Well, not surprisingly,
she had a couple questions.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.217
- Oh boy, was she upset?

08:38.219 --> 08:41.586
- No, I just kinda
matter of factly told her

08:41.588 --> 08:42.621
how babies are made.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.822
She seemed to get it.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.123
- OK, that's good.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.324
- Yeah, except now
she wants to know

08:46.326 --> 08:48.793
when Bonnie's having a baby.

08:48.795 --> 08:50.062
- Oh my God.

08:50.064 --> 08:51.664
- I never really
thought about it.

08:51.666 --> 08:54.933
There are two very
distinct sex talks.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.670
One of them is the
aforementioned procreation

08:57.672 --> 09:01.840
and then there's the lesser
discussed recreational sex.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.075
- Oh my God, you're right.

09:03.077 --> 09:04.409
- I mean, we're all
just so focused on

09:04.411 --> 09:06.078
gettin' through that
first conversation,

09:06.080 --> 09:07.479
but if you think about it,

09:07.481 --> 09:09.882
it's the recreational sex
that's gonna be the most

09:09.884 --> 09:12.284
relevant to Amelia
over her lifetime.

09:12.286 --> 09:13.685
- Did you explain both kinds?

09:13.687 --> 09:15.254
- Oh God no, I'm too tired.

09:15.256 --> 09:18.022
This is not the way I
saw this night going.

09:18.024 --> 09:19.425
- Come here.

09:19.427 --> 09:20.693
I know you've been taking
the brunt of this one.

09:20.695 --> 09:21.894
I'm sorry.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.962
- Yeah well, I'm sorry
that my dad ruined

09:23.964 --> 09:25.898
our game of tennis.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.501
For us and frankly for all
fans of the sport really.

09:29.503 --> 09:32.705
- You really aced that metaphor.

09:35.676 --> 09:39.011
- Well now you've
ruined metaphors, so.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.048
I'm just gonna head to my room.

09:46.653 --> 09:49.154
(upbeat music)

09:57.064 --> 09:59.732
- Morning.
(sighs)

09:59.734 --> 10:01.934
- Holy shit.

10:02.703 --> 10:03.569
- What?

10:04.538 --> 10:06.438
- I had a very erotic dream.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.140
- Oh, tell me more.

10:08.142 --> 10:09.675
- OK.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.677
Mr. Castellotti and I were
having sex in a hotel room

10:11.679 --> 10:13.946
in what I think was San Diego.

10:13.948 --> 10:16.148
- Wow, did not see that coming.

10:16.150 --> 10:17.549
- You know who
did see me coming?

10:17.551 --> 10:18.717
Mr. Castellotti.

10:19.954 --> 10:22.821
Oh God, at one point,
I felt his mustache

10:22.823 --> 10:25.958
on the small of my back.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.426
- On the small of your back?

10:27.428 --> 10:28.727
- Yeah (laughs).

10:28.729 --> 10:30.362
- Was he on his
knees behind you?

10:30.364 --> 10:31.663
- Yes!

10:31.665 --> 10:33.732
- How did he put his
mustache on your back?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.035
- I don't know, it was
like he was praying

10:37.204 --> 10:38.404
to my butt.

10:38.406 --> 10:39.871
- Sounds so sexy.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.306
- It's really not.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.275
Maybe I should call cheater
Eric and find out how

10:43.277 --> 10:45.143
he juggles two lovers.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.878
- Always good to get
advice from experts.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.814
- I actually can't
even joke about that.

10:50.284 --> 10:53.118
- I know we discussed it
but should I tell Elizabeth?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.187
- No, I think you did all
you're supposed to do.

10:55.189 --> 10:57.589
- I know but I just can't
stop thinking about it.

10:57.591 --> 10:58.457
- [Mike] I know.

10:58.459 --> 10:59.324
- Oh God.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.592
- [Mike] What?

11:00.594 --> 11:02.260
- I just remembered
Mr. Castellotti had on

11:02.262 --> 11:05.164
a jean jacket and
at a certain point,

11:05.166 --> 11:10.035
I wore the jean jacket
and felt exhilarated.

11:11.005 --> 11:12.171
- This dream has a lot of parts.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.939
- Mr. Castellotti's
got a lot of parts.

11:13.941 --> 11:14.773
- Eww.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.008
- Didn't feel good.

11:16.010 --> 11:19.011
I mean, his parts did,
obviously, in the dream,

11:19.013 --> 11:21.213
but this saying it now didn't.

11:21.215 --> 11:22.147
You got it.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.549
- Unfortunately, I do.

11:23.551 --> 11:25.750
(upbeat music)

11:25.752 --> 11:27.085
- Hey Sophie!

11:27.087 --> 11:28.220
Oh, I like that dress!

11:28.222 --> 11:29.555
You look so pretty!

11:31.826 --> 11:33.993
I also happen to know you
are very good at math.

11:33.995 --> 11:36.795
So, good for you
for all of that.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.330
- Hey Andrea.

11:38.332 --> 11:40.766
- Oh, hi, hey, how are you?

11:40.768 --> 11:41.567
- Good!

11:42.602 --> 11:44.236
Oh, by the way, I spoke to Eric.

11:44.238 --> 11:45.771
- Oh?

11:45.773 --> 11:47.339
- Yeah, he said that he
wasn't even at the movies

11:47.341 --> 11:49.341
this weekend, so that must
have been someone else.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.210
- It must have been.

11:51.212 --> 11:52.511
- Yeah!

11:52.513 --> 11:56.015
- Well please, tell
him that he has got,

11:56.017 --> 11:58.584
I mean, like an
identical twin just--

11:58.586 --> 11:59.584
- Really?

11:59.586 --> 12:00.985
- Lookin' around the movies.

12:00.987 --> 12:02.454
- He'll be so happy.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.321
- Will he?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.389
OK.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.657
My God, no,

12:05.659 --> 12:06.458
let me grab that.
- Thank you so much.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.392
- What is in here?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.261
- I know, it's the glitter glue.

12:09.263 --> 12:10.396
- Glitter glue?

12:10.398 --> 12:11.463
- [Mr. Castellotti] Ms.
Warren, good morning!

12:11.465 --> 12:12.665
- Oh, good morning.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.866
- Here, let me take your box

12:13.868 --> 12:15.300
and put it up against the wall.

12:17.271 --> 12:18.603
- Great.

12:18.605 --> 12:21.073
Please put my box
against the wall.

12:21.075 --> 12:22.141
That would be lovely.

12:23.410 --> 12:24.176
I'm gonna go.

12:26.346 --> 12:27.613
Have a great day to you both.

12:27.615 --> 12:28.447
- You too.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.149
Sorry.

12:32.353 --> 12:34.286
(upbeat music)

12:34.288 --> 12:36.555
- Dad, you really didn't
have to take me out to lunch.

12:36.557 --> 12:39.291
- I know but I like spending
time with my daughter.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.494
I wanted you to know
how really sorry I am

12:42.496 --> 12:44.062
about what happened
the other night.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.064
- Thank you.

12:45.066 --> 12:46.632
It's fine.

12:46.634 --> 12:48.066
We just had to have the how
babies are made conversation

12:48.068 --> 12:49.668
a little sooner
than anticipated.

12:49.670 --> 12:52.037
Oh before I forget,
Amelia's very interested

12:52.039 --> 12:53.972
in when Bonnie's due
date is and also,

12:53.974 --> 12:55.574
if you have any
ultrasounds scheduled,

12:55.576 --> 12:57.242
she'd love to attend.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.444
- What?

12:58.446 --> 13:00.112
- Ya know, because
when you have sex,

13:00.114 --> 13:01.647
it's to make a baby.

13:01.649 --> 13:03.482
- You didn't tell her
that Bonnie is too old

13:03.484 --> 13:04.983
to have a baby?

13:04.985 --> 13:07.452
- You mean, did I explain
menopause to my six year old?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.688
No, I decided to
hold off on that talk

13:09.690 --> 13:12.291
until I walked her through
what a vasectomy is.

13:12.293 --> 13:14.393
- (sighs) I think that
sounds like sarcasm.

13:14.395 --> 13:15.727
- It's just steps.

13:15.729 --> 13:17.062
It's like you have
to go baby steps.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.663
- Hi, welcome to the Sherman.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.466
My name is Jamie, I'll be
taking care of you today.

13:20.468 --> 13:22.735
Now, first off, have you
dined with us before?

13:22.737 --> 13:24.303
- Yes, we have!

13:24.305 --> 13:25.537
- No, I haven't.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.806
- Well, welcome
back and welcome!

13:27.808 --> 13:30.075
Now, we are a farm
to table kitchen

13:30.077 --> 13:31.810
that focuses on family style.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.113
We bring out each dish
as soon as it's ready.

13:34.115 --> 13:35.280
- Great.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.749
- Now, right now, we're
on our winter menu

13:36.751 --> 13:38.016
which means we're
featuring butternut squash,

13:38.018 --> 13:39.151
pears, and root vegetables.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.753
- Yes, good.
- That sounds fabulous.

13:40.755 --> 13:42.287
Alright, I think--

13:42.289 --> 13:43.221
- Well, let me walk
you through the menu

13:43.223 --> 13:44.690
while we're still here.

13:44.692 --> 13:46.491
On the first page, you'll
find our smaller plates

13:46.493 --> 13:48.761
and on the back,
you'll see our larger,

13:48.763 --> 13:50.295
more traditional entrees.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.563
- Huh.

13:51.565 --> 13:52.364
- Any questions?

13:52.366 --> 13:53.565
- No, thank you!

13:53.567 --> 13:56.701
Great, very thorough.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.569
- I'll be right back.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.171
- Great.
- Thank you.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.774
- Dad, never say it's your
first time at a restaurant.

14:01.776 --> 14:03.142
Always lie.

14:03.144 --> 14:05.344
- Actually, I have
eaten here before.

14:06.580 --> 14:07.980
- What?

14:07.982 --> 14:09.315
What is happening?

14:09.317 --> 14:12.184
- Let the man have his
moment in the spotlight.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.586
- Well you are just a
saint, Saint Martin.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.322
You give, give, give, give.

14:16.324 --> 14:18.256
- Thank you and what else
is going on in your life,

14:18.258 --> 14:19.325
by the way?

14:19.327 --> 14:21.160
- Ugh, this is a little crazy.

14:21.162 --> 14:23.996
So, Amelia's got this amazing
teacher's aid, Elizabeth.

14:23.998 --> 14:27.132
I saw her husband at
the movies with a woman

14:27.134 --> 14:30.536
that was not his wife.

14:30.538 --> 14:31.770
- Did you tell her that
he's cheating on her?

14:31.772 --> 14:34.539
- I mean, I tried
to bring it up,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.809
but I'm not getting
more involved.

14:36.811 --> 14:38.977
- No, it's your
responsibility to tell her.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.345
- Why is it my responsibility.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.814
I barely even know this woman.

14:41.816 --> 14:44.149
- It's not OK that this guy
is walking around out there,

14:44.151 --> 14:46.618
you know, cheating on her.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.353
- Dad, I have to say,
I'm a little surprised

14:48.355 --> 14:52.157
that you have such strong,
conservative views on cheating

14:52.159 --> 14:55.561
considering your
current arrangement.

14:55.563 --> 14:59.031
- Honey, an open relationship
doesn't mean no rules.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.298
- [Andrea] Alright.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.567
- Do you have any idea
how much trust it takes

15:01.569 --> 15:03.168
to do what we do?

15:03.170 --> 15:06.005
- Honestly, I try not
to think about it.

15:06.007 --> 15:08.173
- I'm always happy to
answer any questions.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.576
- Dad, let me tell
you right now.

15:10.578 --> 15:13.111
I'm never gonna
have any questions.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.047
- [Waiter] Alright, have we
made some decisions, folks?

15:15.049 --> 15:17.249
- Yes, we are ready to order.

15:17.251 --> 15:20.385
- I'd like to hear about some
of your signature cocktails.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.786
- Oh, of course.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.655
Now, we have our own
version of the old fashion.

15:23.657 --> 15:26.058
But right now, we're serving
it with clove bitters.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.227
- Dad, are you
considering ordering a

15:28.229 --> 15:30.795
clove bittered old fashion?

15:30.797 --> 15:33.465
- I'm weighing my options.

15:33.467 --> 15:34.399
- Oh, just curious?

15:34.401 --> 15:35.668
- Mmhmm, just curious.

15:37.838 --> 15:39.504
(upbeat music)

15:39.506 --> 15:41.440
- So Bonnie's not having a baby?

15:41.442 --> 15:43.508
- No honey, I'm sorry.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.010
- Why not?

15:46.247 --> 15:48.380
- Well, because
sometimes grown ups

15:48.382 --> 15:50.649
do that thing that
we talked about--

15:50.651 --> 15:51.350
- Sex.

15:53.054 --> 15:54.553
- Yep, sex.

15:55.856 --> 15:58.557
Sometimes grown ups have sex

15:59.793 --> 16:02.127
not because they wanna
make a baby but because

16:02.129 --> 16:07.065
it feels good and it makes
them feel close to each other.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.400
- Why does it feel good?

16:09.804 --> 16:14.673
- Well, ya know how
a hug feels so good?

16:14.675 --> 16:18.043
This is like a very long,

16:19.813 --> 16:24.750
sometimes not that long
um, lying down hug.

16:25.886 --> 16:28.420
- Do you and Daddy
do those hugs?

16:28.422 --> 16:31.556
- Ya know what,
sometimes we do actually,

16:31.558 --> 16:33.692
because we love each other.

16:33.694 --> 16:35.294
- That sounds nice.

16:35.296 --> 16:36.561
- Well, it is.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.931
- Next time you do
that, I wanna watch.

16:40.101 --> 16:41.366
- Hearing it back
in my head now,

16:41.368 --> 16:44.103
I can see why that would
maybe be the takeaway.

16:44.105 --> 16:46.071
- Could I do that hug with you?

16:46.907 --> 16:47.740
- No.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.709
You cannot.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.111
That's not a hug we wanna do.

16:52.113 --> 16:55.380
But I will give you
a hug right now.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.317
(smooching)

16:58.319 --> 17:01.987
So, goodnight to you
and to you, Walter.

17:01.989 --> 17:05.657
If you guys wanna
do a hug, I mean,

17:05.659 --> 17:09.895
a different kind of hug, do it!

17:11.298 --> 17:12.698
Great.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.299
(upbeat music)

17:14.301 --> 17:16.101
- So, now she wants
to watch us have sex?

17:16.937 --> 17:17.936
What did you say to her?

17:17.938 --> 17:19.004
- I don't know!

17:19.006 --> 17:21.373
I think I just
oversold the allure of

17:22.075 --> 17:23.475
horizontal hugs.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.611
That was one of the most
uncomfortable conversations

17:26.613 --> 17:28.113
I've ever had in my life

17:28.115 --> 17:31.483
and I have had some
uncomfortable conversations

17:31.485 --> 17:32.318
in my life.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.485
Oh God.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.753
- Great.

17:34.755 --> 17:35.321
It's all 'cause your
dad couldn't keep

17:35.323 --> 17:36.522
his D in his P.

17:36.524 --> 17:38.357
- First of all,
stop coming onto me.

17:38.359 --> 17:40.526
I appreciate it but
now is not the time.

17:40.528 --> 17:41.960
- Sorry.

17:41.962 --> 17:43.529
- Bright side, now at least
we don't have to worry

17:43.531 --> 17:46.431
anymore about what Amelia's
first sexual image is gonna be.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.966
- How is our daughter
seeing your father

17:47.968 --> 17:49.234
having sex a bright side?

17:49.236 --> 17:52.237
- Mike, this could've
been so much worse.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.040
Rachel's nine-year-old was
shown a bunch of internet porn

17:55.042 --> 17:56.375
at a sleepover.

17:56.377 --> 17:58.143
Now her first sexual
image is of a woman

17:58.145 --> 18:02.381
getting splattered in the face.

18:02.383 --> 18:03.749
- What?

18:03.751 --> 18:05.650
- You know, it's like
these first sexual images,

18:05.652 --> 18:07.319
they kind of imprint
on you, right?

18:07.321 --> 18:09.521
I mean, regardless,
even if it's gross,

18:09.523 --> 18:11.357
it gives you your first tingles

18:11.359 --> 18:13.792
and that sets up
connections for life.

18:13.794 --> 18:16.762
What happens when
your first tingles

18:16.764 --> 18:20.399
are from watching a
woman get gangbanged?

18:20.401 --> 18:21.867
- Jesus Christ.

18:21.869 --> 18:24.536
- Yeah, how does that warp
your perspective on sex, right?

18:24.538 --> 18:25.537
- Yeah.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.172
- Images are very powerful.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.007
Look at me and Ted.

18:28.009 --> 18:29.208
- Who's Ted?

18:29.210 --> 18:30.609
- Mr. Castellotti.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.977
- Oh, is that his first name?

18:31.979 --> 18:34.980
- I don't know, but that's
what I was screamin'.

18:34.982 --> 18:35.948
- Cool.

18:35.950 --> 18:36.782
- Mmhmm.

18:37.985 --> 18:39.952
- Why don't you just
get yourself a beer?

18:39.954 --> 18:41.353
- Because I'm drinking water.

18:41.355 --> 18:42.187
- Hmm.

18:43.758 --> 18:46.258
(jazzy music)

18:50.398 --> 18:53.198
- Why are you staring
at Mr. Castellotti?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.367
- It's just good for
me to see him in this

18:55.369 --> 18:56.702
unflattering light.

18:57.705 --> 18:59.238
- Why?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.406
- Don't worry about it.

19:00.408 --> 19:02.641
- Oh no, no, no, now I'm
very worried about it.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.911
- OK, I had a sex dream
of Mr. Castellotti

19:05.913 --> 19:10.049
and it was very erotic
and it felt intensely real

19:10.051 --> 19:12.818
and now I'm experiencing a
lot of emotions towards him,

19:12.820 --> 19:14.720
mostly sexual in nature.

19:14.722 --> 19:16.455
- This is a great day.

19:16.457 --> 19:18.257
- No, don't get
hysterical, alright,

19:18.259 --> 19:20.659
because I think the
muffin crumbs just

19:20.661 --> 19:24.063
embedded in his mustache
got me to the other side.

19:24.065 --> 19:25.397
- Rewind, rewind.

19:25.399 --> 19:26.665
Tell me the dream,
tell me the dream.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.434
- You don't need
to know much, OK?

19:28.436 --> 19:29.601
We were in San Diego.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.869
- Uh huh.

19:30.871 --> 19:34.005
- He was wearing a
satin boxer brief,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.475
which normally would horrify me,

19:36.477 --> 19:39.811
but in the dream, somehow
I needed it against me.

19:39.813 --> 19:41.012
- Not even want it.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.415
- No, I needed it.
(bell ringing)

19:43.417 --> 19:44.616
Bye bubs, have a good day!

19:44.618 --> 19:46.218
- Have a great one, Izzy.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.052
- Good morning!

19:47.054 --> 19:47.886
- Hi Elizabeth.

19:47.888 --> 19:48.721
- See ya Liz.

19:49.824 --> 19:50.889
- I have a question.

19:50.891 --> 19:52.157
- Yeah?

19:52.159 --> 19:52.891
- How well do you
know Elizabeth?

19:52.893 --> 19:54.493
- Very well.

19:54.495 --> 19:55.560
- Very well?

19:55.562 --> 19:56.762
- Yeah.

19:56.764 --> 19:58.497
- Your daughter's not
even in her class!

19:58.499 --> 20:00.766
Why do you know her very well?

20:00.768 --> 20:03.102
- You know I like
to be involved.

20:03.104 --> 20:04.536
- Yes, I am aware.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.541
Well, I saw her husband
Eric at the movies

20:10.577 --> 20:12.577
clearly having an affair.

20:12.579 --> 20:13.912
- Oh shit.

20:13.914 --> 20:14.913
- Yeah.

20:14.915 --> 20:16.315
- Did you say anything?

20:16.317 --> 20:18.717
- I mean, I hinted at it but
it's a little hard to hint

20:18.719 --> 20:21.120
that your husband's sprinkling
his dick all over town.

20:22.056 --> 20:23.688
- Sprinkling his dick?

20:23.690 --> 20:26.091
What did you see
at this theater?

20:26.093 --> 20:28.093
- I saw things, OK?

20:28.095 --> 20:30.195
- Well, maybe she just
doesn't wanna know.

20:31.132 --> 20:32.431
- Maybe, but I don't know.

20:32.433 --> 20:34.266
Maybe she wants to know more.

20:34.268 --> 20:36.335
Why am I having to
suffer because of his

20:36.337 --> 20:38.337
sexual proclivities.

20:38.339 --> 20:39.772
- Man, her folks are
paying for Eric to go

20:39.774 --> 20:40.839
to law school next year.

20:40.841 --> 20:41.840
- Are you serious?

20:41.842 --> 20:43.542
- That's what she said.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.744
- OK, well that is bullshit.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.414
OK, fuck him.

20:49.350 --> 20:51.550
(upbeat music)
(bell ringing)

20:51.552 --> 20:52.718
Alright bubs, why
don't you go play

20:52.720 --> 20:53.752
for a few minutes?

20:53.754 --> 20:54.619
I wanna talk to Ms. Elizabeth.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.521
- Can I play on the slide?

20:55.523 --> 20:57.289
- You don't have to ask me that.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.291
You literally play
on it every day.

20:59.293 --> 21:00.125
- OK.

21:01.829 --> 21:03.028
- Hey Elizabeth.

21:03.030 --> 21:03.929
- [Elizabeth] Hey!

21:03.931 --> 21:04.963
- Can I talk to you for a second

21:04.965 --> 21:06.098
or are you in the middle of--

21:06.100 --> 21:07.366
- [Elizabeth] Of
course, what's up?

21:07.368 --> 21:09.168
- OK, I just wanted
to let you know that

21:09.170 --> 21:12.637
when I saw Eric at the movies,
I remembered that he was

21:12.639 --> 21:16.976
paying with a credit
card when he was there

21:17.712 --> 21:18.811
with someone else.

21:22.249 --> 21:23.849
- Wow.

21:23.851 --> 21:25.384
- Yeah.

21:25.386 --> 21:30.289
I just thought I should
tell you that part.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.124
- Shit.

21:33.561 --> 21:35.527
- I'm OK if you wanna say fuck.

21:37.798 --> 21:38.597
- Fuck?

21:40.967 --> 21:41.700
- Yeah.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.637
(upbeat music)

21:45.639 --> 21:47.705
- Hey Andrea.

21:47.707 --> 21:48.574
- Hey!

21:48.576 --> 21:50.542
Elizabeth hi, how are you?

21:50.544 --> 21:52.044
- I'm OK.

21:52.046 --> 21:53.845
I just wanted to tell
you that I checked

21:53.847 --> 21:54.780
the credit card bill.

21:54.782 --> 21:55.514
- Oh God.

21:55.516 --> 21:56.348
- And you were right.

21:56.350 --> 21:57.583
- Yeah, yeah.

21:57.585 --> 21:58.917
- It's been going
on for over a year.

21:58.919 --> 22:00.386
- Oh my God.

22:00.388 --> 22:02.187
I am so sorry.

22:02.189 --> 22:06.324
OK ya know what, no offense,
but again, fuck him!

22:06.326 --> 22:08.160
- Not anymore.

22:08.162 --> 22:09.595
- Yes obviously, not anymore.

22:09.597 --> 22:10.429
No, no.

22:11.865 --> 22:12.931
I guess there's nothing
really particularly helpful

22:12.933 --> 22:15.334
I can say right now.

22:15.336 --> 22:16.702
- Nope, there is not.

22:17.772 --> 22:18.937
- I will see you at pick up.

22:18.939 --> 22:19.938
- Yes.

22:19.940 --> 22:21.807
You have a great day.

22:21.809 --> 22:23.475
- Thank you, you too.

22:23.477 --> 22:24.376
- Thank you.

22:24.378 --> 22:25.144
- Bye.

22:26.380 --> 22:27.346
- How'd it go?

22:28.382 --> 22:30.349
- Jesus Christ, creeper.

22:30.351 --> 22:32.618
- I'm part Native
American, I sneak up easy.

22:33.788 --> 22:34.820
- You are not part
Native American.

22:34.822 --> 22:35.687
- But I do sneak up easy.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.089
- Alright, I will give you that.

22:37.091 --> 22:37.990
- So, how was that?

22:37.992 --> 22:39.291
- It was fine, it was fine.

22:39.293 --> 22:40.558
She's gonna be fine.

22:40.560 --> 22:41.627
- OK, good.

22:41.629 --> 22:43.629
I'm proud of you.

22:43.631 --> 22:46.031
- OK, I'm not
interested in garnering

22:46.033 --> 22:47.966
your patronizing praise.

22:47.968 --> 22:49.435
This wasn't for you.

22:49.437 --> 22:50.568
- Well, you're a good girl.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.838
- Eww, do not pat me!

22:52.840 --> 22:53.906
- Go ahead, do mine.

22:54.775 --> 22:55.841
That's soothing, thank you.

22:55.843 --> 22:56.575
- Really?

22:56.577 --> 22:57.409
- Yes, thank you.

22:57.411 --> 22:58.510
- This?

22:58.512 --> 22:59.577
- Thank you.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.980
- OK.
- That's friendship.

23:00.982 --> 23:01.647
- Then we'll just do that.
- That's how friendship works.

23:01.649 --> 23:02.781
- OK great.

23:02.783 --> 23:03.581
Look at us.
- May I touch your face?

23:03.583 --> 23:05.017
- No you may not.

23:05.019 --> 23:06.618
- OK, forgive a man for
being really proud of you.

23:06.620 --> 23:07.853
- Ugh saved.

23:07.855 --> 23:08.988
You have everything you need?

23:08.990 --> 23:10.222
- Yep.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.758
Mommy, do I have to have
a baby when I grow up?

23:13.994 --> 23:15.427
- Uh no, not if
you don't want to.

23:15.429 --> 23:17.629
- Good, then I'm only
gonna do it for fun.

23:19.733 --> 23:20.598
- Bye!

23:20.600 --> 23:21.367
- [Amelia] Bye!

23:22.436 --> 23:24.402
- So, what did that mean?

23:24.404 --> 23:25.804
- Nothing.

23:25.806 --> 23:27.605
- Really 'cause it
sounded like she said that

23:27.607 --> 23:29.608
she didn't wanna have a
baby but then she said

23:29.610 --> 23:31.010
she was only gonna
do it for fun.

23:31.012 --> 23:31.977
- Sex, Ryan.

23:31.979 --> 23:33.211
Sex for fun.

23:33.213 --> 23:35.080
My daughter is only
gonna have sex for fun.

23:35.082 --> 23:37.416
That is her mission
in life, alright?

23:37.418 --> 23:40.218
Can we just now move
along with our lives?

23:40.220 --> 23:45.157
- Uh, you never fail to
bring sunshine into my day.

23:46.027 --> 23:47.025
- No, you don't get to walk.

23:47.027 --> 23:47.893
- I'm walkin' away before you.

23:47.895 --> 23:48.894
- [Andrea] No, I am walking.

23:48.896 --> 23:51.497
(upbeat music)

23:51.499 --> 23:52.898
- Hey guys, good morning!

23:52.900 --> 23:53.965
- Hey, good mornin'.

23:53.967 --> 23:55.167
- How'd you sleep last night?

23:55.169 --> 23:56.301
- Good!

23:56.303 --> 23:59.071
- Any restless
tossing and turning?

23:59.073 --> 24:01.306
Filled with desire?

24:01.308 --> 24:02.241
- Seriously?

24:02.243 --> 24:03.475
You told them?

24:03.477 --> 24:05.477
- Andrea, I had
one of two things

24:05.479 --> 24:08.480
that I could've told them.

24:08.482 --> 24:09.715
- Mmhmm, mmhmm.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.852
I had a sexual dream
about Mr. Castellotti

24:13.854 --> 24:15.921
and it was erotic and arousing.

24:15.923 --> 24:19.391
His mustache went up and
down the small of my back.

24:19.393 --> 24:24.363
He entered me many times
and exited a similar amount.

24:25.099 --> 24:26.332
- That's good news.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.467
- Yes, I'm so happy that
we all now know this.

24:28.469 --> 24:30.602
I hope you all have a great day.

24:30.604 --> 24:32.137
I'm going to go kill myself.

24:32.139 --> 24:32.938
Thank you so much.
- OK.
