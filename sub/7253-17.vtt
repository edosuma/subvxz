01:54.865 --> 01:56.867
I THOUGHT

01:54.865 --> 01:56.867
IT WAS JUST DISCUSSED.

WHO IS IT?

01:56.909 --> 01:58.535

YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.097
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK

02:15.385 --> 02:18.097

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

02:26.187 --> 02:27.898

BUT OUT OF RESPECT FOR MY FRIEND

02:27.940 --> 02:30.275

02:30.317 --> 02:32.193
HOWEVER, THE CIRCUMSTANCES

02:30.317 --> 02:32.193

02:32.235 --> 02:34.071
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:32.235 --> 02:34.071
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:34.113 --> 02:34.989
YOU CHEATED ON RORY.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.281
I DID NOT CHEAT ON RORY.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.158
ARE YOU GOING TO DENY IT?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.158
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

02:38.199 --> 02:39.534
WE WERE APART.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.004
YOU OFFER<i> NOTHING</i> TO WOMEN

02:48.043 --> 02:50.004
OR THE WORLD IN GENERAL.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.339
IF YOU WERE TO DISAPPEAR FROM

02:50.045 --> 02:52.339
THE FACE OF THE EARTH TOMORROW,

02:52.380 --> 02:54.549
THE ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD MISS

02:52.380 --> 02:54.549
YOU IS YOUR PORSCHE DEALER.

02:54.591 --> 02:55.801
WANT TO CHIME IN HERE?

02:55.843 --> 02:57.427
NO, I THINK

02:55.843 --> 02:57.427
PARIS HAS GOT IT COVERED.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.929
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.929
WAIT!

02:58.971 --> 03:00.639
RORY, I JUST NEED

02:58.971 --> 03:00.639
60 SECONDS.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.640
GO AWAY, LOGAN.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.224
NO ONE INVITED YOU IN.

GET OUT RIGHT NOW BEFORE I GO

03:03.266 --> 03:05.060
BONADUCE ON YOUR ASS.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.779
I TOLD YOU TO GO.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.156

03:17.196 --> 03:18.532
I LEFT, AND I GOT DRUNK,

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
WHY I LEFT AND GOT DRUNK,

03:19.783 --> 03:21.702
AND I REALIZED

03:19.783 --> 03:21.702
THAT YOU ARE WRONG.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.579
I AM NOT!

03:21.743 --> 03:24.579
AND WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

03:21.743 --> 03:24.579
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT!

03:24.621 --> 03:26.707
CAN WE GO

03:24.621 --> 03:26.707
IN THE OTHER ROOM?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.249
WE'RE SUPPOSED

03:26.748 --> 03:28.249
TO BE TOGETHER, PARIS.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.002
YOU KNOW IT, I KNOW IT,

03:28.291 --> 03:30.002
YOUR LIFE COACH KNOWS IT.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.586
TERRENCE HAS BEEN WRONG

03:30.044 --> 03:31.586
BEFORE.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.338
WHEN I WANTED TO GET

03:31.628 --> 03:33.338
THE PAGEBOY HAIRCUT, REMEMBER?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.798
PARIS, LISTEN TO ME.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.925
I'M THE BEST THING

03:34.840 --> 03:36.925
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.886
WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE,

03:36.967 --> 03:38.886
THEN IT'S ALL UPHILL FROM HERE.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.096
I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK HERE

03:38.927 --> 03:41.096
BEGGING YOU TO TALK TO ME.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.806
I HAVE OPTIONS.

03:41.138 --> 03:42.806

03:42.848 --> 03:45.433
IN FACT, I ALMOST HOOKED UP

03:42.848 --> 03:45.433
WITH A REALLY HOT CHICK TONIGHT.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.187
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GONNA

03:45.475 --> 03:48.187
HELP YOUR CASE, DOYLE, AT ALL.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.271
FINE. LET'S TAKE THIS

03:48.228 --> 03:50.271
OUT INTO THE HALL.

03:50.313 --> 03:52.357
YOU COULD HAVE HOOKED UP

03:50.313 --> 03:52.357
WITH A HOT CHICK?

03:52.399 --> 03:54.317
IN RHINESTONE BUTTONS?

03:54.359 --> 03:55.485
WHO WAS IT -- SHEILA E.?

03:55.527 --> 03:57.863
TWO MINUTES.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.863
GO.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.407
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND

03:57.905 --> 04:00.407
THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

04:00.448 --> 04:02.450
AND I REALLY WISH

04:00.448 --> 04:02.450
YOU HADN'T FOUND OUT LIKE THAT,

04:02.492 --> 04:03.827
BUT I LOVE YOU.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.827
YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.620
WHEN I SAID

04:03.869 --> 04:05.620
THAT I WAS YOUR BOYFRIEND,

04:05.662 --> 04:08.123
I AGREED TO BE FAITHFUL TO YOU,

04:05.662 --> 04:08.123
WHICH WAS A FIRST FOR ME.

04:08.165 --> 04:10.751
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA

04:08.165 --> 04:10.751
BE HARD, BUT IT WASN'T.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.336
THEN I ASKED YOU

04:10.792 --> 04:13.336
TO MOVE IN WITH ME,

04:13.378 --> 04:15.463
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA

04:13.378 --> 04:15.463
BE HARD, BUT IT WASN'T.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.799
I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY FAITHFUL

04:15.505 --> 04:17.799
TO YOU, RORY.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.718
I HAVE NOT BEEN

04:17.841 --> 04:19.718
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.470
I'VE NOT EVEN THOUGHT

04:19.760 --> 04:22.470
ABOUT ANOTHER GIRL.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.264
EXCEPT FOR WALKER,

04:22.512 --> 04:24.264
ALEXANDRA...

04:24.305 --> 04:26.266
WE WERE BROKEN UP, RORY.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.266
NO,<i> YOU</i> WERE.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.851
I THOUGHT

04:26.307 --> 04:27.851
WE WERE BROKEN UP.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.644
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT

04:27.893 --> 04:29.644
THE FIGHT WAS.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.606
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT

04:29.686 --> 04:32.606
THE SEPARATION WAS.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.067
DO YOU BELIEVE

04:32.647 --> 04:35.067
THAT I HONESTLY THOUGHT

04:35.109 --> 04:36.193
WE WEREN'T TOGETHER?

04:36.235 --> 04:38.195
I GUESS.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.487
SO THEN,

04:38.237 --> 04:39.487
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT,

04:39.529 --> 04:40.488
THAT I THOUGHT

04:39.529 --> 04:40.488
WE WEREN'T TOGETHER,

04:40.530 --> 04:41.782
THEN DO YOU BELIEVE THAT,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.826
IN MY MIND,

04:41.823 --> 04:44.826
I WAS NOT CHEATING ON YOU?

04:44.868 --> 04:45.702
I GUESS.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.121
SO THEN IF YOU BELIEVE

04:47.162 --> 04:48.956
THAT, IN MY MIND,

04:47.162 --> 04:48.956
I WAS NOT CHEATING ON YOU,

04:48.997 --> 04:51.041
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FORGET

04:48.997 --> 04:51.041
WHAT THOSE VIPERS SAID TODAY,

04:51.083 --> 04:53.835
PUT IT BEHIND YOU,

16:02.754 --> 16:05.298

16:08.175 --> 16:10.386
WHY ARE YOU STOPPING?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.430
BECAUSE THIS CONTRAPTION,

16:10.428 --> 16:12.430
AS YOU CALL IT,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.432
CAN ONLY BE USED

16:12.472 --> 16:14.432
WHEN THE CAR IS STOPPED.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.893
SO EVERY TIME WE WANT TO ASK

16:14.474 --> 16:16.893
THE MACHINE FOR DIRECTIONS,

16:16.935 --> 16:18.728
WE HAVE TO PULL OVER

16:16.935 --> 16:18.728
TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD?

16:18.770 --> 16:20.020
IT WOULD APPEAR SO.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.940
I THOUGHT THE POINT

16:20.062 --> 16:21.940
OF THE MACHINE

16:22.022 --> 16:24.191
WAS TO AVOID PULLING OVER

16:22.022 --> 16:24.191
TO ASK DIRECTIONS.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.860
IF I TOLD PEOPLE,

16:24.233 --> 16:25.860
THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.787

16:35.829 --> 16:37.914
not to babysit us

16:35.829 --> 16:37.914
and make decisions for us

16:37.956 --> 16:39.290
about how to live our lives.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.334

16:39.332 --> 16:41.334
the radio won't turn on

16:41.375 --> 16:42.251

16:42.293 --> 16:43.711

21:02.011 --> 21:03.470
I MADE YOUR FAVORITES.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.639
BUT MY PARENTS AREN'T

21:03.512 --> 21:05.639
GONNA EAT ANY OF THIS.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.516
YOUR PARENTS?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.516
I THOUGHT THIS WAS FOR YOU.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.435
YOU THOUGHT

21:07.558 --> 21:09.435
I WANTED TO SIT BY MYSELF

21:09.476 --> 21:12.105
AND EAT AN ENTIRE BUFFET OF

21:09.476 --> 21:12.105
THE WORLD'S MOST FATTENING FOOD?

21:12.146 --> 21:14.565
I FIGURED IT WAS JUST

21:12.146 --> 21:14.565
ONE OF YOUR CRAVINGS

21:14.607 --> 21:16.943
OR MAYBE JUST A FUN WAY TO

21:14.607 --> 21:16.943
ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.569
WHAT?

21:18.611 --> 21:21.864
WELL, YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING

21:18.611 --> 21:21.864
ABOUT BEING A SUDDEN PARENT

21:21.906 --> 21:23.657
OR EXPECTING

21:21.906 --> 21:23.657
OR BEING DUE SOON.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.786
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR ANYTHING

21:23.699 --> 21:26.786
OVER THAT DAMN CUISINART

21:26.827 --> 21:28.495
AND ALL

21:26.827 --> 21:28.495
THOSE GOSSIPING BUSBOYS.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.081
SO YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT?

21:30.123 --> 21:33.584
NO, I'M JUST EXPECTING

21:30.123 --> 21:33.584
MY PARENTS OVER ANY MINUTE.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.920
WELL, YEAH,

21:33.626 --> 21:35.920
THAT MAKES SENSE, TOO.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.880
THAT'S OKAY.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.880
WE'LL MAKE DO.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.506
I'M NOT PREGNANT!

21:39.548 --> 21:40.674
OKAY! OKAY!

21:40.716 --> 21:43.594
NOW, THE FOOD...

21:40.716 --> 21:43.594
RIGHT.

21:43.636 --> 21:48.015
OKAY, THE MINI HOT DOGS

21:43.636 --> 21:48.015
CAN BE BRATWURST.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.601
THE MAC AND CHEESE CAN BE

21:48.057 --> 21:50.601
PASTA à LA SOOKIE.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.895
AND, PRESTO,

21:50.643 --> 21:52.895
THE TAQUITOS ARE BLINIS.

21:52.937 --> 21:53.980
AND THE CHILI FRIES?

21:54.021 --> 21:55.189
ARE CHILI FRIES.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.189
RIGHT.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.190
HEY, SOOKIE.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.067
HI, RORY.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.067
BLINI?

21:58.109 --> 22:00.402
YES, PLEASE.

22:00.444 --> 22:03.072
SO, I CLEARED OUT

22:00.444 --> 22:03.072
ALL THE MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS,

22:03.114 --> 22:04.531
AND MOST OF THE BOOKS

22:04.573 --> 22:06.575
AND I HID AWAY ALL

22:04.573 --> 22:06.575
THE THROW PILLOWS AND BLANKETS

22:06.617 --> 22:07.827
AND I LOWERED THE HEAT TO 55

22:07.868 --> 22:09.203
TO ENSURE MINIMAL

22:07.868 --> 22:09.203
POST-MEAL LINGERING.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.412
YALE-EDUCATED.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.623
I'LL GO DO

22:10.454 --> 22:12.623
ONE FINAL WALK-THROUGH.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.001
LAST CHANCE

22:12.665 --> 22:15.001
BEFORE I STASH THEM.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.754
I'M NOT!

22:15.042 --> 22:18.754
OKAY, OKAY.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.173
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA'S JAG

22:18.796 --> 22:20.173
IS HERE.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.133
WHAT?

22:20.214 --> 22:22.133
I DIDN'T HEAR THEM DRIVE UP.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.759
DID YOU?

22:22.175 --> 22:23.759
NO.

22:23.801 --> 22:26.095
WELL, WHERE THE HELL

22:23.801 --> 22:26.095
ARE THEY?

22:23.801 --> 22:26.095
I DON'T KNOW!

22:26.137 --> 22:27.596
MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN.

22:27.638 --> 22:28.722
DON'T TEASE ME.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.850
GO!

22:28.764 --> 22:30.850
I'LL FINISH SETTING UP.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.564
THE ENGINE'S COLD.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.525
[ GASPS ]

22:37.606 --> 22:39.525
MAYBE THEY<i> HAVE</i> BEEN TAKEN!

22:41.359 --> 22:43.612
HELLO, LORELAI,

22:41.359 --> 22:43.612
RORY.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.612
HI, GRANDMA.

22:43.654 --> 22:46.532
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

22:43.654 --> 22:46.532
OH, JUST

22:43.654 --> 22:46.532
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.867
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

22:46.573 --> 22:47.867
YOU WERE PAINTING.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.202
I KNOW.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.202
IT'S PART OF THE REMODEL.

22:49.243 --> 22:51.245
AND IS THAT

22:49.243 --> 22:51.245
THE FINAL COLOR?

22:49.243 --> 22:51.245
YEP.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.413
MUST BE SO NICE

22:51.287 --> 22:53.413
NOT HAVING TO WORRY

22:53.455 --> 22:55.373
ABOUT A HOMEOWNER'S

22:53.455 --> 22:55.373
ASSOCIATION.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.335
THERE'S A BOAT HERE.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.211
DAD!

22:58.252 --> 22:59.545
LORELAI, RORY.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.297
WHEN DID YOU GET

22:59.586 --> 23:01.297
A BOAT, LORELAI?

23:01.339 --> 23:03.381
RICHARD, I'VE SEEN THAT BOAT.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.381
IT'S LUKE'S.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.051
WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK

23:03.423 --> 23:05.051
VERY SEAWORTHY.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.927
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.927
IT WAS HIS FATHER'S.

23:06.969 --> 23:08.888
LUKE KEEPS HIS DEAD FATHER'S

23:06.969 --> 23:08.888
BOAT LOCKED AWAY IN YOUR GARAGE?

23:08.929 --> 23:10.430
MOTHER.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.430
WHAT?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.225
I'M JUST SAYING,

23:10.472 --> 23:12.225
ISN'T THAT KIND OF MORBID?

23:12.266 --> 23:14.101
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S USING IT

23:12.266 --> 23:14.101
TO HOLD HIS BONES.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.771
YOU GUYS MUST BE HUNGRY.

23:14.143 --> 23:17.771
LET'S HEAD INSIDE.

23:23.610 --> 23:24.945
WELL, WELL.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.989
I HAD NO IDEA

23:24.987 --> 23:26.989
YOU'D HAD SO MUCH WORK DONE.

23:27.031 --> 23:30.076
OH, IT'S NOTHING EXTENSIVE --

23:27.031 --> 23:30.076
A NIP HERE, A TUCK THERE.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.119
THIS ROOM'S

23:30.117 --> 23:32.119
BEEN COMPLETELY REDONE.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.205
A NIP, NIP, NIP,

23:32.161 --> 23:34.205
TUCK, TUCK, TUCK.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.749
APPARENTLY YOU HAVEN'T INSTALLED

23:34.247 --> 23:36.749
THE HEAT YET.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.543
WHAT'S THIS?

23:36.790 --> 23:39.543
Rory:

23:36.790 --> 23:39.543
THAT'S PAUL ANKA.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.837
YOU HAVE A DOG?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.837
I JUST GOT HIM.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.297
WHEN?

23:41.879 --> 23:43.297
YESTERDAY.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.216
OH, WELL, FAST LEARNER,

23:43.339 --> 23:45.216
THAT ONE.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.801
YOU SHOULD OPEN AN OBEDIENCE

23:45.258 --> 23:47.801
SCHOOL. YOU'D MAKE A FORTUNE.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.762
OH, MOM, DAD,

23:47.843 --> 23:49.762
YOU REMEMBER SOOKIE.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.472
HELLO, SOOKIE.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.472
WILL YOU BE JOINING US

23:49.803 --> 23:52.472
FOR DINNER?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.974
NO, I'M JUST HELPING.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.102
THE WAINSCOTING HERE

23:54.016 --> 23:56.102
IS SUBSTANDARD.

23:56.143 --> 23:58.604
I COULD HAVE RECOMMENDED

23:56.143 --> 23:58.604
A REAL PROFESSIONAL.

23:58.645 --> 23:59.980
SINCE MINE

23:58.645 --> 23:59.980
WAS A FAKE PROFESSIONAL,

24:00.022 --> 24:01.523
I GOT TO PAY HIM

24:00.022 --> 24:01.523
IN MONOPOLY MONEY.

24:01.565 --> 24:04.277
IS THAT VENEER?

24:01.565 --> 24:04.277
TELL ME THAT'S NOT VENEER.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.403
SO, SOOKIE,

24:04.318 --> 24:05.403
TAPAS IN THE KITCHEN?

24:05.443 --> 24:06.737
RIGHT THIS WAY.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.530
YOU'RE STILL EATING

24:06.779 --> 24:08.530
IN THE KITCHEN?

24:08.572 --> 24:10.616
WE ALWAYS EAT IN THE KITCHEN.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.616
THAT'S WHERE THE FOOD IS.

24:10.657 --> 24:12.201
GRANDPA, COULD I OFFER YOU

24:10.657 --> 24:12.201
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

24:12.243 --> 24:14.828
I SUPPOSE IT'S NOT TOO EARLY

24:12.243 --> 24:14.828
FOR A SCOTCH.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.207
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, GRANDMA?

24:14.870 --> 24:18.207
GRANDMA?

24:18.249 --> 24:21.294
Emily: UP HERE.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.294
RICHARD, COME HAVE A LOOK.

24:21.335 --> 24:22.044
WHERE ARE YOU?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.712
IN THE BEDROOM.

24:23.754 --> 24:25.005
THREE MINUTES GONE,

24:23.754 --> 24:25.005
THEY'RE ALREADY IN MY BEDROOM.

24:25.047 --> 24:26.715
IMPRESSIVE, BY THE WAY,

24:26.757 --> 24:29.260
WITH ALL THE THROW PILLOWS,

24:26.757 --> 24:29.260
BLANKETS, MAGAZINES, AND BOOKS.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.304
PILED UP ON THE BED?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.304
BATHTUB.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.763
THAT'S GONNA TAKE

24:31.345 --> 24:32.763
SOME EXPLAINING.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.640
MM-HMM.

24:37.643 --> 24:40.104
HEY, MRS. KIM.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.688
STILL ON THE FIRST SONG,

24:40.146 --> 24:41.688
HUH?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.732
NO, I'VE LISTENED TO

24:41.730 --> 24:43.732
THE WHOLE THING MANY TIMES.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.025
YEAH? AND?

24:43.774 --> 24:45.025
NOTHING CATCHY.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.610
<i>NOTHING</i> OUT OF

24:45.067 --> 24:46.610
ALL THOSE SONGS?

24:46.652 --> 24:48.237
THERE ARE GOOD BITS

24:46.652 --> 24:48.237
HERE AND THERE,

24:48.279 --> 24:49.655
AND LANE CAN REALLY POUND

24:48.279 --> 24:49.655
THE SKINS,

24:49.696 --> 24:51.031
BUT YOU NEED A HIT.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.616
BUT TONS OF GREAT BANDS

24:51.073 --> 24:52.616
DON'T HAVE HITS.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.118
I DON'T CARE

24:52.658 --> 24:54.118
ABOUT OTHER BANDS.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.828
I CARE ABOUT YOUR BAND --

24:54.160 --> 24:55.828
LANE'S BAND.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.663
DON'T YOU CARE

24:55.869 --> 24:57.663
ABOUT YOUR BAND?

24:55.869 --> 24:57.663
I CARE A BUTTLOAD.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.832
THEN WRITE A HIT.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.832
OKAY, NOT A PROBLEM.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.667
McCARTNEY HASN'T WRITTEN A HIT

24:59.873 --> 25:01.667
IN 20 YEARS,

25:01.708 --> 25:03.210
BUT I'LL JUST SIT DOWN

25:01.708 --> 25:03.210
AND CRANK ONE OUT.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.837
YOU WILL IF YOU WANT

25:03.252 --> 25:04.837
TO MARRY LANE.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.464
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW IT WORKS.

25:06.504 --> 25:07.840
I'LL TELL YOU HOW IT WORKS.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.758
YOU WRITE A HIT.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.758
YOU GET A RECORD CONTRACT.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.551
YOU WRITE A HIT.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.551
YOU GET REPRESENTATION.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.262
YOU WRITE A HIT.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.262
YOU BECOME HUSBAND.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.888
CAN YOU DO IT?

25:13.304 --> 25:14.888
CAN YOU WRITE A HIT?

25:14.930 --> 25:17.099
I DON'T KNOW -- MAYBE.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.099
I CAN TRY.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.477
DON'T TRY -- DO.

25:19.517 --> 25:22.480
3 1/2 MINUTES, TOPS,

25:19.517 --> 25:22.480
AND RADIO-FRIENDLY.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.983
THIS PASTA à LA SOOKIE

25:24.023 --> 25:25.983
IS VERY GOOD, LORELAI.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.443
IT'S A BIG HIT

25:26.025 --> 25:27.443
AROUND THE INN.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.486
THERE'S SOMETHING

25:27.485 --> 25:28.486
VERY FAMILIAR ABOUT IT.

25:28.526 --> 25:30.446
I CAN'T QUITE PLACE IT.

25:30.488 --> 25:33.949
IT'S SIMILAR TO THE PASTA

25:30.488 --> 25:33.949
à LA FROMAGE AT DE L'éTOILE'S.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.285
AH, YES, DE L'éTOILE

25:33.991 --> 25:36.285
SOUNDS LIKE MY KIND OF GUY.

25:36.327 --> 25:38.745
[ CELLPHONE RINGING ]

25:36.327 --> 25:38.745
WHAT'S THAT NOISE

25:36.327 --> 25:38.745
THAT KEEPS HAPPENING?

25:38.787 --> 25:40.831
THAT'S MY CELLPHONE, GRANDMA.

25:38.787 --> 25:40.831
I'LL TURN IT OFF.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.376
OR YOU CAN JUST TAKE IT

25:40.873 --> 25:43.376
IN THE OTHER ROOM, IF YOU WANT.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.751
NOPE, IT'S OFF.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.420
PASS THE BLINIS.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.840
SO, LORELAI, A NEW DOG,

25:46.462 --> 25:49.840
A NEW BEDROOM, A NEW BATHROOM.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.091
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE NEW HOUSE.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.052
EXCEPT THAT IT'S

25:51.133 --> 25:53.052
THE SAME HOUSE.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.637
IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.637
IT'S LUCKY WE HAD YOUR ADDRESS.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.181
WE WOULD HAVE

25:55.679 --> 25:57.181
DRIVEN RIGHT BY.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.766
WELL, I WAS WAITING TILL

25:57.223 --> 25:59.766
IT WAS ALL DONE TO SHOW YOU.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.519
ALL DONE?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.519
THERE'S MORE THAT YOU'RE DOING?

26:01.559 --> 26:02.853
OH, YEAH, THE MAILBOX

26:01.559 --> 26:02.853
IS CROOKED,

26:02.895 --> 26:04.522
AND I WAS GONNA PLANT A BUSH

31:37.646 --> 31:40.190
WELL, TAKE YOUR TRAINING

31:37.646 --> 31:40.190
SOMEWHERE ELSE, OKAY?

31:40.232 --> 31:42.860
YOUR SCARING AWAY ALL

31:40.232 --> 31:42.860
MY CUSTOMERS AND MY STAFF.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.070
UNFORTUNATELY,

31:42.901 --> 31:45.070
THERE IS NOWHERE ELSE.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.446
TRAINEES DON'T GET OFFICES

31:46.488 --> 31:47.989
OR SALARIES

31:46.488 --> 31:47.989
OR JACKETS, ACTUALLY.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.825
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE

31:48.031 --> 31:49.825
HAVING THIS DRY-CLEANED

31:49.867 --> 31:51.243
FOR ONE

31:49.867 --> 31:51.243
OF THE SENIOR BROKERS.

31:51.284 --> 31:53.370
IT SMELLS A LITTLE FUNKY

31:51.284 --> 31:53.370
BUT FITS LIKE A DREAM.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.788
YOU'VE GOT KIRK.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.331
YES, MRS. ZELNOR.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.250
RIGHT, THE DRAGONFLY INN.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.418
SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

31:59.459 --> 32:00.753
WAIT,

31:59.459 --> 32:00.753
YOU'RE MEETING CLIENTS HERE?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.087
ONLY A FEW.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.087
NO.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.672
I PROMISE

32:02.128 --> 32:03.672
I'LL BE OUT OF YOUR HAIR

32:03.714 --> 32:05.131
AS SOON AS I MAKE MY BONES.

32:05.173 --> 32:07.843
I JUST NEED A TEMPORARY PLACE

32:05.173 --> 32:07.843
TO CONDUCT MY BUSINESS

32:07.885 --> 32:10.429
AND POTENTIALLY HAVE SEX

32:07.885 --> 32:10.429
WITH PROSPECTIVE CLIENTS.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.305
WHAT?

32:10.470 --> 32:12.305
THAT'S KIRK'S OTHER THING --

32:12.347 --> 32:14.391
THE YOUNG,

32:12.347 --> 32:14.391
VIRILE EYE CANDY ANGLE

32:14.433 --> 32:16.685
FOR LONELY WIDOWS

32:14.433 --> 32:16.685
AND AGING DIVORCéES.

32:16.727 --> 32:17.977
WORKS LIKE A CHARM.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.438
I PLAN ON RUNNING IT BY LULU,

32:18.019 --> 32:19.438
OF COURSE.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.648
KIRK, GET OUT OF HERE.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.817
TAKE YOUR JACKET AND YOUR DIPPY

32:21.690 --> 32:23.817
"STAR TREK" DEVICE

32:23.859 --> 32:25.652
AND YOUR CREEPY NEW CAREER

32:23.859 --> 32:25.652
AND SCRAM.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.195
FINE,

32:25.694 --> 32:27.195
BUT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED

32:27.237 --> 32:28.947
A LITTLE MORE COOPERATION

32:27.237 --> 32:28.947
FROM YOU,

32:28.988 --> 32:31.032
CONSIDERING WHAT I'M DOING

32:28.988 --> 32:31.032
FOR YOUR PARENTS.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.785
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

32:31.074 --> 32:32.785
FOR MY PARENTS?

32:32.826 --> 32:34.369
SHOOT, I SHOULD

32:32.826 --> 32:34.369
NOT HAVE SAID THAT.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.871
SAID WHAT?

32:34.411 --> 32:35.871
NOTHING.

32:35.913 --> 32:37.664
I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM

32:35.913 --> 32:37.664
NOR DENY

32:37.706 --> 32:39.499
THAT YOUR PARENTS ARE LOOKING

32:37.706 --> 32:39.499
FOR A PLACE IN STARS HOLLOW.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.835
MY PARENTS ARE LOOKING

32:39.541 --> 32:41.835
FOR A PLACE IN STARS HOLLOW?!

32:41.877 --> 32:43.336
I CAN'T SAY.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.464
THE REALTOR-TRAINEE/CLIENT

32:43.378 --> 32:45.464
PRIVILEGE IS SACROSANCT.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.006
THE MANUAL'S VERY CLEAR

32:45.505 --> 32:47.006
ON THAT.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.842
HOW LONG

32:47.048 --> 32:48.842
HAVE THEY BEEN LOOKING?

32:48.884 --> 32:51.094
I'VE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH.

32:48.884 --> 32:51.094
IT ISN'T EVEN MY ACCOUNT.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.805
HOW LONG, KIRK?

32:52.846 --> 32:55.098
ALL I KNOW IS THEY'RE LOOKING,

32:52.846 --> 32:55.098
THEY'RE PRICING,

32:55.140 --> 32:57.893
THEY'VE SEEN THREE GRACIOUS

32:55.140 --> 32:57.893
SINGLE-FAMILY TUDORS THIS WEEK,

32:57.935 --> 33:00.103
AND THEY HAVE A 2:00 P.M.

32:57.935 --> 33:00.103
SHOWING TOMORROW

33:00.145 --> 33:01.730
AT 546 OAK RIDGE LANE.

33:01.772 --> 33:04.691
BUT I CANNOT AND WILL NOT

33:01.772 --> 33:04.691
VIOLATE THEIR CONFIDENCE.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.109
THIS<i> CANNOT</i> BE HAPPENING.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.235
KIRK HERE.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.237
WELL, HELLO, MISS WYATT.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.323
LOVELY TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.951
HAVE I GOT A DUPLEX

33:11.364 --> 33:13.951
FOR YOU.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.036
I AM GETTING THREE HOT DOGS

33:13.992 --> 33:17.036
TONIGHT, AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.956
I HAVE "BUGSY MALONE"

33:17.078 --> 33:18.956
RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD,

33:18.997 --> 33:20.373
ESPECIALLY THE SCENE

33:20.415 --> 33:22.501
WHERE SCOTT BAIO

33:20.415 --> 33:22.501
BUYS FLORRIE DUGGER A HOT DOG

33:22.542 --> 33:25.170
AND HE OFFERS HER MUSTARD

33:22.542 --> 33:25.170
WITH ONIONS OR KETCHUP WITHOUT.

33:25.211 --> 33:27.255
SO I STARTED THINKING,

33:25.211 --> 33:27.255
"WHAT WOULD I LIKE --

33:27.297 --> 33:29.257
MUSTARD WITH ONIONS

33:27.297 --> 33:29.257
OR KETCHUP WITHOUT?"

33:29.299 --> 33:31.969
AND THEN, SUDDENLY, THEY BOTH

33:29.299 --> 33:31.969
STARTED TO SOUND REALLY GOOD.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.471
BUT I USUALLY GET MY HOT DOGS

33:32.010 --> 33:34.471
WITH KETCHUP AND RELISH.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.431
AND YOU DON'T JUST WALK OUT

33:34.513 --> 33:36.431
ON SOMETHING

33:36.473 --> 33:38.141
THAT HAS SERVED YOU SO WELL

33:36.473 --> 33:38.141
FOR SO LONG.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.768
SO THREE HOT DOGS IT IS.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.895
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED

33:39.810 --> 33:41.895
TO FLORRIE DUGGER, ANYWAY?

33:41.937 --> 33:43.271
OH, SHE MOVED TO STARS HOLLOW,

33:43.313 --> 33:45.398
AND HER MOTHER HARPED

33:43.313 --> 33:45.398
ON HER HAIRSTYLE SO MUCH,

33:45.440 --> 33:46.817
SHE JUMPED OFF A BRIDGE.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.817
WHAT?

33:46.859 --> 33:48.485
THE GILMORES

33:46.859 --> 33:48.485
ARE MOVING IN.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.111
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:48.527 --> 33:50.111
KIRK WAS IN HERE TODAY.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.822
NOTHING GOOD STARTS WITH,

33:50.153 --> 33:51.822
"KIRK WAS IN HERE TODAY."

33:51.864 --> 33:54.783
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE'S BEEN

33:51.864 --> 33:54.783
TAKING MY PARENTS AROUND

33:54.825 --> 33:55.993
TO LOOK AT HOUSES.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.536
AROUND HERE?

33:56.034 --> 33:57.536
YES.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.078
BUT WHY?

33:57.577 --> 33:59.078
WHY?!

33:59.120 --> 34:01.331
BECAUSE LUKE AND I

33:59.120 --> 34:01.331
ARE GETTING MARRIED,

34:01.373 --> 34:03.166
AND I GUESS THEY FIGURE

34:01.373 --> 34:03.166
WE'LL BE HAVING KIDS,

34:03.208 --> 34:05.043
AND THEY WANT TO BE NEAR ME

34:03.208 --> 34:05.043
WHEN THAT HAPPENS --

34:05.084 --> 34:07.420
<i>REALLY</i> NEAR, LIKE IN THE ROOM

34:05.084 --> 34:07.420
WEARING BILL BLASS SCRUBS.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
OH, BOY.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

34:09.506 --> 34:12.467
I MOVED 30 MILES AWAY

34:09.506 --> 34:12.467
FROM MY PARENTS FOR A REASON.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.011
THOSE 30 MILES ACT AS BUFFER

34:14.052 --> 34:15.303
SO THAT WHEN MY MOTHER

34:14.052 --> 34:15.303
SAYS SOMETHING

34:15.345 --> 34:16.555
THAT MAKES ME WANT

34:15.345 --> 34:16.555
TO KILL HER,

34:16.596 --> 34:17.806
I HAVE TO DRIVE 30 MILES

34:16.596 --> 34:17.806
TO DO IT.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.892
10 MILES IN,

34:17.848 --> 34:19.892
I USUALLY CALM DOWN

34:19.933 --> 34:21.852
OR I GET HUNGRY

34:19.933 --> 34:21.852
OR I PASS A MALL --

34:21.894 --> 34:24.187
SOMETHING PREVENTS ME

34:21.894 --> 34:24.187
FROM ACTUALLY KILLING HER.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.189
THAT BUFFER IS MY MOTHER'S

34:24.229 --> 34:26.189
BEST FRIEND.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.358
TAKE THE BUFFER AWAY

34:26.231 --> 34:28.358
AND YOU GOT NANCY GRACE

34:28.400 --> 34:30.610
CAMPING OUT ON MISS PATTY'S LAWN

34:28.400 --> 34:30.610
FOR A MONTH.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.654
OKAY, YOU NEED TO GET A GRIP.

34:30.652 --> 34:32.654
MAYBE KIRK IS WRONG.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.239
MAYBE.

34:32.696 --> 34:34.239
WELL, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.782
HERE, LET ME DISTRACT YOU

34:34.280 --> 34:35.782
WITH A PRESENT.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.283
FOR ME?

34:35.824 --> 34:37.283
FOR YOU.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.245
WELL, THE WORLD STOPS

34:37.325 --> 34:40.245
FOR A PRESENT.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.245
MM-HMM.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.163
OH, IT'S SO CUTE.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.163
I LOVE IT!

34:42.205 --> 34:44.708
GOOD. YOU WANT TO KNOW

34:42.205 --> 34:44.708
WHERE I GOT IT?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.043
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

34:46.084 --> 34:47.502
AT ANNA NARDINI'S STORE.

34:47.544 --> 34:49.629
WHAT?

34:47.544 --> 34:49.629
IT WAS GREAT.

34:49.671 --> 34:51.757
I JUST STROLLED RIGHT IN,

34:49.671 --> 34:51.757
LOOKED VERY CASUAL.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.342
I DIDN'T HAVE TO PRETEND

34:51.798 --> 34:54.342
LIKE I NEEDED HELP OR ANYTHING.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.677
SHE JUST CAME

34:54.384 --> 34:55.677
RIGHT UP TO ME.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.679
I TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT

34:55.719 --> 34:57.679
TO GO THERE.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.222
WELL, YOU DIDN'T.

34:57.721 --> 34:59.222
<i>I</i> DID.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.974
I DIDN'T WANT YOU

34:59.264 --> 35:00.974
TO GO THERE, EITHER.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.601
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

35:01.016 --> 35:02.601
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.894
LUKE ASKED ME

35:02.642 --> 35:03.894
TO STAY OUT OF THIS.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.896
HE TOLD ME

35:03.936 --> 35:05.896
THAT HE WOULD DEAL WITH IT.

35:05.938 --> 35:09.190
BUT YOU'RE HIS FIANCéE.

35:05.938 --> 35:09.190
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

35:05.938 --> 35:09.190
TO TRUST YOUR FIANCéE.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.734
OH, RIGHT,

35:09.232 --> 35:10.734
THE WAY HE TRUSTED YOU

35:10.776 --> 35:12.277
WHEN HE FOUND OUT

35:10.776 --> 35:12.277
ABOUT APRIL?

35:12.318 --> 35:13.612
HEY!

35:12.318 --> 35:13.612
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.321
I JUST THINK IT'S CRAZY

35:15.363 --> 35:17.323
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

35:15.363 --> 35:17.323
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS WOMAN.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.242
RORY, THIS CONVERSATION

35:17.365 --> 35:19.242
IS OVER.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.286
SO YOU'RE NOT AT ALL CURIOUS

35:19.284 --> 35:21.286
ABOUT HER?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.286
NO.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.622
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW

35:21.327 --> 35:23.622
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE?

35:21.327 --> 35:23.622
NO.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.249
YOU SERIOUSLY DON'T CARE

35:23.663 --> 35:26.249
WHETHER SHE'S PRETTY OR NOT?

35:23.663 --> 35:26.249
NO!

35:26.291 --> 35:28.043
SO YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN

35:26.291 --> 35:28.043
THE FACT THAT SHE HAS GOOD TASTE

35:28.085 --> 35:30.796
IN CLOTHES OR MUSIC OR --

35:28.085 --> 35:30.796
RORY, STOP! DROP IT!

35:28.085 --> 35:30.796
I MEAN IT!

35:30.837 --> 35:32.798
FINE.

35:32.839 --> 35:35.968
I GUESS YOU DON'T

35:32.839 --> 35:35.968
WANT THE PURSE THEN.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.875

36:17.509 --> 36:20.219

42:30.840 --> 42:32.717
THEY TOLD ME YOU'VE BEEN

42:30.840 --> 42:32.717
E-MAILING STUFF.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.469
SO AT LEAST I KNEW

42:32.758 --> 42:34.469

42:34.511 --> 42:36.804
I'M SO SORRY.

42:34.511 --> 42:36.804
IT JUST BECAME THIS WHOLE THING.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.681
MY GRANDPARENTS

42:36.846 --> 42:38.681

42:38.723 --> 42:39.932

42:39.974 --> 42:41.726
IT'S A LONG STORY.

42:41.767 --> 42:43.853
BUT I PROMISE

42:41.767 --> 42:43.853
IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

42:43.895 --> 42:44.979
I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.189
RORY.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.189

42:47.899 --> 42:49.984
YEAH, IT'S FINE.
