03:17.379 --> 03:18.607
Hey, watch it.

03:34.029 --> 03:36.463
Oh, come on.

03:44.072 --> 03:45.767
Hey, Mike!

03:45.941 --> 03:48.569
- Hey, Larry.
- How you doing?

03:48.744 --> 03:49.938
Have you seen Nicky?

03:50.112 --> 03:52.672
I'm pretty sure he went with Erica.
It was half day today.

03:52.848 --> 03:55.043
Parent Career Day.

04:00.889 --> 04:03.414
- Hey.
- Hey. Come on in.

04:04.593 --> 04:07.619
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

04:08.096 --> 04:10.087
Why didn't anybody tell me
it was Career Day?

04:10.265 --> 04:12.529
What do you mean?
Nicky said he was gonna tell you.

04:13.935 --> 04:16.495
Oh, okay, I guess he forgot.

04:16.672 --> 04:19.004
There he is. How are you, Larry?

04:19.173 --> 04:21.199
Good. How are you doing, Don?

04:22.077 --> 04:23.544
Good.

04:24.579 --> 04:26.376
Can you believe this weather?

04:27.616 --> 04:32.349
Chilly, right? Chilly, chilly,
Chilly Willy the penguin.

04:34.589 --> 04:37.888
Leave me alone. Hey, why don't I go tell
the little corncob you're here.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.257
Great. Great, that's great. Yeah, thanks.

04:42.798 --> 04:46.063
Wow, your fiance really manages
to squeeze a lot onto that belt.

04:46.234 --> 04:47.565
- Stop it.
- What?

04:47.736 --> 04:50.671
What? No, it's like he's...

04:50.839 --> 04:52.500
...the Batman of stockbrokers.

04:52.674 --> 04:55.643
- Bond trader.
- Bond trader. Sorry.

04:55.811 --> 05:00.180
Hey, how's it going with that virtual-reality
driving range that you wanted to open?

05:00.349 --> 05:03.409
Getting there, still waiting for
the technology to catch up.

05:03.585 --> 05:05.815
It's not easy,
there are a lot of moving parts.

05:07.089 --> 05:10.422
Hey, do you think Nick
would like Queens?

05:10.592 --> 05:14.084
Oh, no, Larry. You didn't get evicted again,
did you?

05:14.663 --> 05:16.358
I didn't...

05:16.531 --> 05:19.523
...get evicted. I didn't get evicted, no.
I mean, I didn't...

05:19.701 --> 05:22.727
- No, I didn't get evicted yet. It's like--
- Larry, listen to me.

05:22.904 --> 05:24.769
I don't know how much more
Nicky can take.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.568
Every couple months, it's a new career,
a new apartment.

05:27.743 --> 05:31.008
If it wasn't for Nicky, I wouldn't
say anything, I would stay out of it.

05:31.179 --> 05:33.875
It's just, it's too much instability.
It's not good for him.

05:34.082 --> 05:36.573
I'm trying to figure things out
right now, okay?

05:41.356 --> 05:42.846
You know...

05:43.959 --> 05:46.519
...I don't think that Nicky
should stay with you.

05:46.695 --> 05:50.256
- What?
- Just until you get really settled.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.825
Hey, Dad.

05:53.001 --> 05:56.061
- Hey, ready to carve it up?
- Cool.

06:00.876 --> 06:04.539
All right, good!
Take it, Nicky! Break away!

06:08.750 --> 06:11.275
- What are you doing?
- Hey, Nicky! Are you all right?

06:12.687 --> 06:15.815
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Would you get off the ice?

06:15.991 --> 06:18.425
Listen. Their left defenseman
is a very weak skater.

06:18.593 --> 06:21.426
So you go left side, you got
a clear shot at the goal. Okay?

06:21.596 --> 06:23.757
- Cool, thanks.
- All right, man.

06:24.499 --> 06:29.869
We're good here. We're good.
All right. As you were, skaters.

06:30.405 --> 06:32.168
Game on!

06:33.341 --> 06:34.899
I'm good.

06:35.076 --> 06:37.340
I'm telling you,
you tore it up out there today.

06:37.512 --> 06:40.003
Thinking the NHL is a serious possibility.

06:40.182 --> 06:43.515
I don't really wanna be
a hockey player anymore.

06:45.187 --> 06:48.782
- All right. What do you wanna be?
- A bond trader.

06:49.658 --> 06:50.886
A bond trader?

06:51.059 --> 06:54.995
Yeah, it's what Don does.
He took me to his office last week.

06:55.831 --> 06:57.128
That's cool.

06:57.299 --> 06:59.961
So you wanna dress up
in a monkey suit and tie every day?

07:00.135 --> 07:03.002
Like an automaton robot?

07:03.505 --> 07:06.872
Trust me, you can't play hockey
in a cubicle. Kind of awkward.

07:07.242 --> 07:09.369
Well, he's got a pretty big office.

07:10.011 --> 07:12.445
That's not the point.
Come on, you love hockey.

07:12.614 --> 07:15.742
I still like it,
but bond trading's my fallback.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.680
Your fallback?

07:17.853 --> 07:20.617
Wait a minute. You're too young
to have a fallback, okay?

07:20.789 --> 07:23.724
And also, where did you ever
even hear that word?

07:23.892 --> 07:26.952
Mom was talking to Don
about all your different schemes.

07:27.128 --> 07:28.493
She called them schemes?

07:28.663 --> 07:31.564
She said it was time
you found a fallback.

07:34.936 --> 07:37.234
Are you really moving again?

07:40.342 --> 07:42.606
I don't know. We'll see. I mean...

07:42.777 --> 07:45.211
...there's some pretty cool places
out in Queens.

07:45.380 --> 07:47.974
- Yeah.
- Hey.

07:48.149 --> 07:50.845
Hey, Nicky, look at me.

07:51.219 --> 07:53.517
Look at me, man.
I wanna tell you something.

07:53.688 --> 07:56.919
I know that things have been kind of
up and down for me lately...

07:57.092 --> 07:58.855
...and that's been hard for you.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.957
But I really feel like my moment's coming
and when it does...

08:02.130 --> 08:05.122
...everything's just gonna come together,
you know?

08:05.300 --> 08:06.562
What if you're wrong...

08:06.735 --> 08:10.330
...and you're just an ordinary guy
who should get a job?

08:16.511 --> 08:18.342
All right, well...

08:21.316 --> 08:23.750
You know what,
we'll figure it out, okay?

08:24.619 --> 08:27.884
All right? Come on,
let's get you back to Mom's.

08:35.363 --> 08:38.628
Mr. Daley, I can honestly say,
in 43 years at this agency...

08:38.799 --> 08:41.530
...I've never seen a resume
quite like yours.

08:42.136 --> 08:43.832
All right.

08:45.273 --> 08:47.605
That wasn't a compliment.

08:48.243 --> 08:50.074
It says here you were the CEO...

08:50.245 --> 08:52.770
...of Snaptime lndustries.

08:52.948 --> 08:54.472
Care to elaborate on that?

08:54.649 --> 08:59.586
Sure. Well, that was the umbrella
corporation for my invention, the Snapper.

08:59.754 --> 09:03.281
You know, you snap, the lights come on.
Snap, they come off.

09:03.458 --> 09:06.086
Didn't they already make that?

09:07.362 --> 09:11.025
No, no, that's the Clapper,
which, obviously...

09:11.199 --> 09:12.826
...stole a bit of our thunder.

09:13.001 --> 09:16.402
Personally, I don't really see
what the big difference is, I mean:

09:16.571 --> 09:18.971
You know, whatever, but...

09:19.140 --> 09:24.442
...apparently there is a significant portion
of the population that has trouble actually...

09:24.613 --> 09:27.605
- ...snapping.
- Clapping's easier.

09:28.950 --> 09:30.542
Debatable.

09:30.952 --> 09:32.715
I can't help you.

09:33.488 --> 09:34.682
Debbie?

09:34.856 --> 09:36.619
Can I call you Debbie? Because...

09:36.791 --> 09:39.089
...I felt a connection
when I entered this office...

09:39.260 --> 09:41.626
...and I don't know,
I feel like you did too.

09:42.564 --> 09:44.725
I didn't feel a connection.

09:47.402 --> 09:48.699
Look.

09:49.838 --> 09:53.569
I need a job tomorrow, okay?

09:53.742 --> 09:55.607
If I don't have one...

09:56.311 --> 09:58.575
Well, I just need it, okay?

09:58.847 --> 10:01.111
Well, I don't know.

10:01.383 --> 10:03.681
I might have one thing.

10:04.085 --> 10:08.351
They've turned down everyone
I've sent over there, but--

10:08.523 --> 10:09.990
Great.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.189
-- who knows?

10:13.895 --> 10:15.192
You might get lucky.

10:48.897 --> 10:51.525
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

10:51.700 --> 10:56.364
I'm Larry Daley. I've got a job interview
with Cecil Fredricks.

10:56.871 --> 10:59.965
- Right. He should still be in his office.
- Great.

11:00.141 --> 11:03.599
- I'm Rebecca Hutman. I'm a docent here.
- Hi.

11:03.778 --> 11:07.043
- Let me point you in the right direction.
- Great.

11:09.350 --> 11:10.612
Teddy Roosevelt, right?

11:10.785 --> 11:14.448
- Yes, a great visionary.
- Yes, definitely.

11:14.622 --> 11:16.681
He was our 4th president, right?

11:16.858 --> 11:19.088
- Twenty-sixth.
- Twenty-sixth.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.229
Please don't touch the exhibits!
I mean...

11:22.397 --> 11:23.694
Riffraff.

11:24.132 --> 11:27.158
Miss Hutman.
I cannot tolerate this type of chaos.

11:27.335 --> 11:30.532
I mean, this is a museum, not a...

11:31.973 --> 11:33.838
Do you know what "museum" means?

11:34.776 --> 11:38.507
It doesn't mean,
"Daddy, it's a big Tyrannosaurus thing.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.308
Can I touch its leg? " No!

11:41.583 --> 11:43.414
Work it out, please.

11:43.585 --> 11:46.349
- Will do, sir.
- Thank you.

11:46.855 --> 11:48.982
Dr. McPhee, the museum director.

11:49.157 --> 11:50.954
Seems like a fun guy.

11:51.126 --> 11:54.152
Control your young, please. Can we?

12:05.840 --> 12:09.037
Hello? Just kidding.

12:09.210 --> 12:12.839
Hi. I'm Larry Daley.
Are you Mr. Fredricks?

12:13.014 --> 12:15.175
Mr. Fredricks was my father.

12:15.350 --> 12:18.683
I am Cecil. Good to meet you, Larry.
Nice firm handshake.

12:18.853 --> 12:22.380
I like that. Tells a lot about a man.
Come on in.

12:26.728 --> 12:29.629
Let's talk turkey here.

12:31.566 --> 12:35.161
The museum is losing money,
hand over fist.

12:35.336 --> 12:39.636
I guess kids today don't care about
wax figures or stuffed animals.

12:40.108 --> 12:43.805
So they're downsizing,
which is code for firing...

12:43.978 --> 12:45.946
...myself and the other two night guards.

12:46.314 --> 12:48.407
They want to replace us
with one new guard.

12:48.583 --> 12:52.110
- Oh, sorry.
- Well, what are you gonna do?

12:52.287 --> 12:55.848
I'd like you to meet
my two colleagues here.

12:56.024 --> 12:58.458
Reginald? Gus?

12:58.626 --> 13:01.220
Where is he? I'll beat him with my fist!

13:03.064 --> 13:06.693
Gus, this is Larry Daley, the kid who
wants to be the new night guard.

13:08.369 --> 13:09.358
Night guard?

13:09.537 --> 13:12.700
No, the lady at the agency said
this was a museum position.

13:12.874 --> 13:16.002
Most important position
in the museum, Larry.

13:16.177 --> 13:17.974
He looks like a weirdie.

13:18.746 --> 13:21.146
Wonderful guard, terrible people skills.

13:21.316 --> 13:24.649
Now, listen, lunch box.
Don't try anything funny.

13:24.819 --> 13:28.016
I once went nine rounds
with John L. Sullivan.

13:28.256 --> 13:30.986
You never fought John L. Sullivan
in your life.

13:31.159 --> 13:33.753
Gentlemen, we have
a job candidate here.

13:33.928 --> 13:36.453
He's got an excellent resume,
a winning attitude...

13:36.631 --> 13:38.997
...and I say let's give him a shot.
What do you say?

13:39.167 --> 13:43.228
Hang on a sec. I think I might wanna
have a little time just to think it over.

13:43.404 --> 13:46.669
Do you want the job or not, snack shack?

13:49.043 --> 13:52.945
- No, no, I want the job--
- Welcome to the night guards, Larry.

13:53.882 --> 13:55.941
Larry, meet me up on the second floor.

13:56.117 --> 13:59.883
I'll slip into my orthopedics and
give you a little tour. Arthritic knees.

14:00.288 --> 14:04.054
Not fun getting old, my friend. Go on.

14:09.998 --> 14:12.398
You really think he's the one?

14:13.868 --> 14:15.563
Oh, yes.

14:15.737 --> 14:17.671
He's the one.

14:30.885 --> 14:34.844
Gotta keep it moving, Larry.
I'm pretty spry for an old man.

14:35.023 --> 14:38.186
This is the Diorama Room.

14:38.359 --> 14:40.350
Oh, yeah.

14:40.762 --> 14:45.563
I remember these little guys. Cute.

14:47.902 --> 14:49.836
Cecil!

14:52.640 --> 14:54.767
Hey, Cecil!

15:07.922 --> 15:10.447
- Did I get you good?
- Yeah.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.957
You got me.

15:16.197 --> 15:21.430
Seriously, though, no fooling around
in here. This stuff is really old.

15:21.602 --> 15:26.630
All right, then. As you can see,
it's pretty quiet in here these days.

15:27.008 --> 15:30.535
On the left there is your Attila the Hun.

15:31.879 --> 15:35.042
And here we have our Easter lsland head.

15:36.617 --> 15:38.414
Hey, Cecil.

15:40.455 --> 15:44.983
And this, of course,
is the Hall of African Mammals.

15:45.159 --> 15:47.525
Ah, yes.

15:48.463 --> 15:51.955
Monkeys. I love monkeys.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.129
- Yeah.
- Guy's cute.

15:55.303 --> 15:59.103
Yeah, we call him Dexter.
He's quite a little...

15:59.273 --> 16:02.003
...ball of fun, aren't you, Dexter?

16:04.645 --> 16:06.408
Moving on.

16:08.549 --> 16:13.384
And, finally, this is the temple
of the Pharaoh Ahkmenrah.

16:15.656 --> 16:20.355
And in that tomb right down there,
the pharaoh himself.

16:20.528 --> 16:21.825
Neat.

16:22.030 --> 16:24.191
And hanging on the wall behind him...

16:24.365 --> 16:29.803
...was his most prized possession,
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

16:30.171 --> 16:33.538
Twenty-four-carat gold.
It's worth a fortune.

16:33.708 --> 16:35.437
Very cool.

16:35.610 --> 16:37.237
It is indeed, Larry.

16:38.312 --> 16:40.246
Very cool.

16:44.318 --> 16:48.482
All right. Report here at 5 tomorrow.
We'll walk you through your duties.

16:48.656 --> 16:50.521
Okay, 5. I'll be here.

16:50.691 --> 16:52.591
Moving on.

16:54.062 --> 16:57.156
Hey, it's me. So I got a job.

16:57.331 --> 16:59.663
Larry, that's great. What is it?

16:59.834 --> 17:02.997
It's a job...

17:03.171 --> 17:06.435
...at the Museum of Natural History.

17:06.607 --> 17:09.234
Yeah, so you can tell Nicky
that we won't be moving.

17:09.410 --> 17:10.637
Larry, this is good news.

17:10.811 --> 17:13.473
Yeah, no, definitely.
So I'll see you tomorrow?

17:13.647 --> 17:16.116
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

17:25.460 --> 17:26.858
Larry?

17:27.261 --> 17:29.991
Your keys. Your torch.

17:30.164 --> 17:32.962
- Right.
- You'll wanna strap those to your belt.

17:33.134 --> 17:35.398
It can get a little spooky
around here at night...

17:35.570 --> 17:38.061
...so you might wanna
put a few lights on.

17:39.006 --> 17:42.134
All right, flashlight, keys.
What am I for-- ?

17:44.812 --> 17:46.643
The instruction manual.

17:46.814 --> 17:48.076
Instructions.

17:48.249 --> 17:51.480
You start with one, two, three...

17:51.652 --> 17:52.983
Four?

17:53.154 --> 17:54.951
Are you cracking wise?

17:55.123 --> 17:58.024
I ought to punch you
in the nose, hopscotch.

17:58.192 --> 18:01.184
Leave him alone, Gus.
You got it covered, right, Larry?

18:01.362 --> 18:03.489
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

18:03.664 --> 18:06.064
- You better get it!
- Gus.

18:06.234 --> 18:09.726
Larry, do them in order,
do them all and do them quick.

18:09.904 --> 18:15.103
And the most important thing of all
to remember: Don't let anything in or out.

18:15.276 --> 18:16.504
Out?

18:16.677 --> 18:18.372
Good luck, son.

18:18.546 --> 18:21.447
- Night, Gus.
- Young buck. Cracking wise.

18:21.616 --> 18:23.243
Moving on.

18:58.186 --> 18:59.710
Hello?

18:59.887 --> 19:01.718
Hello!

19:01.923 --> 19:03.618
Check!

19:03.791 --> 19:06.453
Check.

19:06.661 --> 19:10.153
I am Larry.

19:10.331 --> 19:14.324
Check! Larry! Larry.

19:19.674 --> 19:22.108
Monday! Monday! Monday!

19:22.276 --> 19:24.836
Monster Truck Rally.

20:45.793 --> 20:47.590
Cecil?

20:50.431 --> 20:53.525
Okay, very funny, Cecil!

20:54.969 --> 20:57.961
What is this, like a
David Copperfield thing?

21:06.080 --> 21:08.412
This is weird.

21:17.058 --> 21:18.787
Cecil?

22:08.509 --> 22:13.139
Come on. Revolve. Revolve!

22:26.527 --> 22:28.995
- Name, please?
- Cecil...

22:29.597 --> 22:32.998
- ...Fredricks!
- One moment. Connecting.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.226
- Hello.
- Cecil! It's Larry Daley!

22:35.403 --> 22:37.394
Larry. Yes, how can I help you?

22:37.571 --> 22:40.199
The dinosaur-- The dinosaur is alive!

22:40.374 --> 22:42.501
I'm having a little trouble
hearing you, friend.

22:42.676 --> 22:43.973
Tequila.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.942
The dinosaur's alive!

22:46.113 --> 22:47.546
What do I do?
Tell me what to do!

22:47.715 --> 22:50.878
Read the instructions.
It explains everything.

22:52.887 --> 22:54.582
Okay, I got them!

22:55.623 --> 22:57.648
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Wait! What-- ?

23:07.268 --> 23:08.895
What bone?

24:06.727 --> 24:08.490
Fetch?

24:12.032 --> 24:13.795
Play fetch?

24:36.857 --> 24:38.688
No way.

24:49.670 --> 24:51.194
- Dum-dum.
- Yes?

24:51.372 --> 24:54.398
- You give me gum-gum.
- I give you gum-gum?

24:54.575 --> 24:57.567
You new dum-dum.
You give me gum-gum.

24:59.046 --> 25:01.412
Okay, you know what?
I have no gum-gum. Sorry.

25:01.582 --> 25:03.447
And my name isn't dum-dum,
my name's Larry.

25:03.617 --> 25:06.245
No, your name dum-dum.

25:07.588 --> 25:10.523
Oh, you in trouble, dum-dum.

25:10.691 --> 25:13.524
You'd better run-run
from Attila the Hun-Hun.

25:17.631 --> 25:19.360
See you later, dum-dum.

25:55.402 --> 25:57.461
What is happening?

26:37.378 --> 26:38.675
Hey.

26:39.913 --> 26:41.437
How you doing?

26:44.652 --> 26:46.210
Are you...?

26:47.021 --> 26:48.283
You're...

26:49.156 --> 26:51.317
..."Sakagahwahwaya"?

26:51.492 --> 26:52.959
You're "Sakagawaya"?

26:53.160 --> 26:55.958
Oh, Sakagawea. You're Sakagawea?

26:56.563 --> 26:59.225
The glass. I can't...

26:59.400 --> 27:00.958
...hear you.

27:01.168 --> 27:04.695
You can't...? You can't hear me?

27:04.872 --> 27:07.340
Excuse me.
"Who assisted the Lewis and Clark-- "

27:07.641 --> 27:10.838
Right, so that's Lewis and Clark
and you're... Right.

27:11.011 --> 27:13.138
You seem-- I'm Larry.

27:13.847 --> 27:17.214
What's going on? What's-- ?
Do you know what's going on here?

27:19.586 --> 27:21.144
Huns. I gotta--

28:07.134 --> 28:08.965
Hey. Hi.

28:09.136 --> 28:11.536
Tin Man. Hey. Hi. How you doing?

28:11.705 --> 28:14.868
I'm new. It says I'm supposed to
lock up the lions or they'll eat me.

28:16.844 --> 28:19.574
You're Galileo? No?

28:41.468 --> 28:42.901
Okay...

28:43.137 --> 28:44.900
Hey, I'm the...

28:46.607 --> 28:51.010
Hi. I'm the new guy
and I'm just locking up, so...

28:52.946 --> 28:56.438
If it's cool with you
I'm just gonna get my paperwork...

28:57.985 --> 28:59.782
...and be out of your hair, okay?

29:56.009 --> 29:59.809
"Double-check your belt.
The monkey probably stole your keys."

29:59.980 --> 30:01.675
Monkey.

30:04.484 --> 30:08.420
Hey. Hey there. Hi.
What's your name? Your name is...

30:09.189 --> 30:11.419
No, no, no. Come back. Come back.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.560
Dewey? Is that your name, Dewey?

30:13.727 --> 30:17.686
No, no, no. What's-- ? Dewey?
Dexter? Dexter. Dexter, right?

30:17.865 --> 30:20.060
Hey, Dexter,
you wanna give me those keys?

30:20.234 --> 30:22.464
I just want to lock up.

30:22.636 --> 30:24.763
Yes. Oh, good. Come to Papa.

30:24.938 --> 30:29.602
Oh, thank you. Can I have those keys?
Oh, good. What a good boy.

30:29.776 --> 30:31.710
That's okay. Oh, thank you.

30:31.879 --> 30:35.713
Oh, no, no, no. It's okay.
Thank you very, very much.

30:57.771 --> 30:59.602
Bad monkey. Stop that.

30:59.773 --> 31:02.867
That's not right. Are you done?

31:04.111 --> 31:06.705
Do you have an issue with me?
Do you have an issue with me?

31:06.880 --> 31:09.940
Because if I have a problem with somebody,
I don't pee on them, okay?

31:10.117 --> 31:13.416
And also-- Let me tell you something.
These keys?

31:14.421 --> 31:16.719
Hey. Dexter, that's not funny.
Give it back.

31:16.890 --> 31:18.721
Dexter. Give--

31:20.761 --> 31:24.925
Don't. I know what you're thinking.
Don't do it. Not a good idea.

31:25.098 --> 31:26.656
Not-- Dexter, I need those.

31:27.434 --> 31:30.562
Don't encourage him. You think
you're funny for your friends, huh?

31:30.737 --> 31:33.797
You three guys-- What, he's the ringleader,
you're the audience?

31:33.974 --> 31:35.669
Yeah, no. Don't do it, okay?

31:35.842 --> 31:37.469
Lookit-- You!

31:50.590 --> 31:52.490
Oh, this is not happening.

32:01.335 --> 32:03.303
Oh, man.

32:29.529 --> 32:31.292
What are you guys doing?

32:32.165 --> 32:33.860
I can't feel my lip.

32:35.235 --> 32:36.896
Oh, shit.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.299
Man.

33:06.199 --> 33:08.690
Hey. Hey.

33:10.370 --> 33:12.395
Hey, stop that.

33:17.377 --> 33:19.208
Hog-tie him, boys.

33:20.414 --> 33:24.441
- Get him, that big old Bocephus of a man.
- Hey, what are you doing?

33:24.618 --> 33:26.950
Cinch him up good.
You ain't so big now, are you?

33:27.120 --> 33:29.111
Hey. Hey, stop that.

33:32.893 --> 33:35.453
Every night, year after year...

33:35.629 --> 33:39.121
...one of you guards
locks us up in these boxes.

33:39.299 --> 33:42.530
Well, I hereby say, sir, enough!

33:44.204 --> 33:46.434
Fire up the iron horse, boys.

33:54.548 --> 33:57.210
- Hey, blondie?
- Name's Jedediah.

33:57.384 --> 33:59.375
All right, Jedediah. Stop the train, please.

33:59.553 --> 34:03.148
- That's a big no-can-do, Cracker Jack.
- What's going on here, huh?

34:03.323 --> 34:05.553
- Somebody's gotta pay.
- Pay for what?

34:05.725 --> 34:10.560
I don't know. Just pay. Now, stop whining
and just take it like a man.

34:15.135 --> 34:16.762
Seriously, stop the train.

34:16.937 --> 34:19.770
- All right, stop the train.
- Thank you.

34:19.973 --> 34:21.998
Now full speed ahead and ram him!

34:22.175 --> 34:23.972
Split his head like a watermelon!

34:26.179 --> 34:27.840
For crying out loud.

34:28.014 --> 34:29.504
All right, that's enough.

34:29.683 --> 34:32.481
We got a breach.

34:40.560 --> 34:45.554
I got him. I got him. I got him, guys.
I got him--

34:49.302 --> 34:52.760
- Oh, my...
- Prepare the catapults.

34:52.938 --> 34:57.501
Octavius, hold on. This ain't your fight.
This here giant's on our land.

34:57.677 --> 35:00.168
Hey, little guy. Jed? Yeah.

35:00.347 --> 35:03.282
Sorry, look. I just-- I'm not a giant.
I'm just an average-sized--

35:03.450 --> 35:05.145
Don't talk down to me.

35:05.318 --> 35:08.344
I'm not a giant, guys. All right?
You guys are really little.

35:08.622 --> 35:12.820
We may be small,
but our hearts are large...

35:12.993 --> 35:14.984
...metaphorically speaking.

35:15.162 --> 35:17.494
Don't take that wrong.
I'm saying you're miniatures.

35:17.664 --> 35:20.565
Silence! The Roman Empire
knows no boundaries.

35:20.734 --> 35:23.328
- Don't you do it, son.
- Do what?

35:23.503 --> 35:24.902
- Octavius.
- Don't do what?

35:25.071 --> 35:28.529
- Unleash hell!
- Don't--

35:39.352 --> 35:41.081
Climb aboard, boy.

35:41.254 --> 35:43.347
Take the hand, son.

35:45.592 --> 35:46.923
Onboard.

35:48.562 --> 35:52.430
That's right. You better run, boy.
You hear Jedediah?

35:52.599 --> 35:57.059
That mustachioed horseman ain't always
gonna be there to protect you, you hear me?

36:00.040 --> 36:01.598
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

36:01.775 --> 36:03.640
Theodore Roosevelt,
26th president...

36:03.810 --> 36:06.176
...of these United States of America
at your service.

36:06.613 --> 36:11.243
Okay. I'm Larry Daley,
the new night guard.

36:14.054 --> 36:17.251
Pleasure to me you, Lawrence Daley.
You'll have to excuse me, though.

36:18.158 --> 36:19.955
The hunt is afoot.

36:21.428 --> 36:22.793
Hunt's afoot.

36:23.530 --> 36:26.863
Excuse me, Mr. President.
Could I ask you something?

36:27.067 --> 36:29.092
- Yes, but just one question.
- All right.

36:29.269 --> 36:32.466
Okay, why? Is it just some, like,
three-wishes kind of deal, or-- ?

36:34.241 --> 36:37.506
Not at all. Self-reliance
is the key to a vigorous life.

36:37.677 --> 36:41.875
A man must look inward to find
his own answers. How can I be of help?

36:42.048 --> 36:45.575
I don't really know how to put this,
and please don't take it the wrong way...

36:45.852 --> 36:49.310
...but isn't everything in this museum
supposed to be, you know...

36:49.489 --> 36:51.047
- ...dead?
- Dead?

36:52.259 --> 36:55.057
- Yeah.
- Follow me.

36:57.964 --> 36:59.522
Yell all you want, pharaoh.

36:59.699 --> 37:03.658
You've been in there 54 years.
You're not getting out tonight.

37:03.970 --> 37:06.734
There's the source of all this commotion.

37:06.906 --> 37:10.137
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah.

37:10.844 --> 37:14.905
Arrived here in 1952
from the Nile expedition.

37:15.448 --> 37:21.284
On that night,
everything in this museum came to life.

37:21.454 --> 37:23.945
And every night since.

37:28.461 --> 37:31.897
So everything in the museum
comes to life every night?

37:32.065 --> 37:33.555
Exactly.

37:34.100 --> 37:36.762
And I'm supposed to do what?

37:36.936 --> 37:42.033
You're the night watchman, Lawrence.
A venerable position in this institution.

37:43.943 --> 37:47.106
- Come on, lad.
- All right. Okay. This is impossible.

37:47.314 --> 37:50.112
Nothing's impossible.
If it can be dreamed, it can be done.

37:50.283 --> 37:53.275
Hence the 20-foot jackal staring at you.
Don't make eye contact.

37:53.453 --> 37:56.820
Your job is to make sure that everyone
stays inside the museum...

37:56.990 --> 37:59.618
...because if the sun rises
and anyone's on the outside...

37:59.793 --> 38:01.852
...we turn to dust.

38:02.429 --> 38:04.795
- You turn to dust?
- Dust.

38:04.964 --> 38:06.727
- Really?
- Really.

38:07.434 --> 38:10.335
Now, it's almost dawn.
I shall help you restore order tonight.

38:10.503 --> 38:14.064
But mark my words, it's the last time
I shall ever do so. Is that clear?

38:15.408 --> 38:18.673
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, I guess. I don't...

38:18.845 --> 38:21.814
Stop babbling, boy! Yes or no?

38:21.981 --> 38:23.642
- Yes.
- Good.

38:23.817 --> 38:25.808
Let's ride.

38:36.029 --> 38:39.362
All right. So the Hall of Reptiles is secure.

38:47.841 --> 38:49.672
What are you looking at?

38:52.045 --> 38:54.411
I'm tracking, dear boy.

38:55.081 --> 38:58.414
Man's got to track.
Welcome to the family, Lawrence.

38:59.386 --> 39:01.445
See you tomorrow night.

39:01.621 --> 39:04.385
Actually, I gotta be honest.
I don't think I'm coming back.

39:04.557 --> 39:06.821
What? You've only just begun.

39:06.993 --> 39:09.427
Yeah, well, this is not exactly what l--

39:09.596 --> 39:10.790
- Lawrence?
- Yeah?

39:10.964 --> 39:13.091
What did you do
before you took this post?

39:13.266 --> 39:17.362
Well, I've done a lot of different things.
I invented this thing called the Snapper.

39:17.537 --> 39:19.129
Did you give up on that as well?

39:19.305 --> 39:22.536
No, I just hit a few roadblocks.
You might have heard of The Clapper?

39:22.709 --> 39:23.903
- Lawrence.
- Yes, sir?

39:24.077 --> 39:29.515
Some men are born great.
Others have greatness thrust upon them.

39:29.916 --> 39:33.716
For you, this is that very moment.

40:00.780 --> 40:03.078
Bully. Got you, boy.

40:03.249 --> 40:04.682
Yeah. You got me.

40:08.488 --> 40:10.854
Say hello to your little friend.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.355
- What are you doing?
- Put me down.

40:14.527 --> 40:16.688
I don't like to be manhandled.

40:16.863 --> 40:20.060
- Just calm down, Jed.
- lt doesn't feel good.

40:20.233 --> 40:23.828
- lt makes me feel small and powerless.
- You done?

40:24.003 --> 40:28.463
I'm gonna shoot you in your dang eye.
In your dadgum eye.

40:29.142 --> 40:31.508
Yeah, keep shooting.
Nothing's gonna happen.

40:31.678 --> 40:34.146
Now you know my shame.

40:34.314 --> 40:39.809
Jedediah's impotent rage.
His guns don't fire. Take me away.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.547
This ain't over.
You ain't seen the last of me.

40:42.722 --> 40:44.781
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

40:44.958 --> 40:46.516
Duck!

40:50.196 --> 40:52.357
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.

40:52.532 --> 40:54.022
This is not worth 11.50 an hour.

40:54.200 --> 40:58.398
Look, the giant's scared.
There's a bigger giant running around.

41:35.408 --> 41:37.171
Hello.

41:37.343 --> 41:38.901
Larry?

41:40.847 --> 41:42.314
Larry?

41:47.620 --> 41:50.953
Oh, don't do that.
We're too old for surprises.

41:51.124 --> 41:54.093
Really? I thought you liked surprises.
Like how you surprised me...

41:54.260 --> 41:57.161
...with the fact everything in
the museum comes to life at night.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.797
That little sweetheart.

41:58.965 --> 42:01.525
We wanted to tell you.
You never would have believed us.

42:01.701 --> 42:03.862
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- What?

42:04.037 --> 42:08.269
- You have any idea what I've been through?
- Keep a lid on it, butterscotch.

42:08.441 --> 42:12.036
I don't know if what happened last night
was real, but I didn't sign up for this.

42:12.211 --> 42:16.238
I just need a regular job that
is not life-threatening and pays my bills.

42:16.416 --> 42:20.113
So thank you very much
and I left my uniform in the office...

42:20.286 --> 42:22.652
- ...and I will be seeing you.
- Larry!

42:28.561 --> 42:31.029
- Dad?
- Hey.

42:31.197 --> 42:33.495
Hey, buddy.
What are you guys doing here?

42:33.666 --> 42:37.500
Oh, Erica had to be in court early,
so I'm taking Mr. Big Stuff here to school.

42:37.670 --> 42:39.968
But he wanted to swing by,
see you in the new job.

42:41.307 --> 42:43.434
It's so awesome
that you're working here.

42:44.210 --> 42:46.701
Hey, Niko, you wanna take
a little look-a-doo inside?

42:46.879 --> 42:48.847
Maybe your dad will give you a VlP tour.

42:49.015 --> 42:51.449
You know what?
We're pretty slammed this morning.

42:51.618 --> 42:56.146
Yeah, but Nicky, I promise,
I'll show you around soon, okay? Deal?

42:56.322 --> 42:57.983
- Deal.
- All right.

42:58.157 --> 43:00.148
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

43:00.326 --> 43:01.987
- Love you.
- Love you too, buddy.

43:02.161 --> 43:03.958
Bye, now. All right.

43:33.860 --> 43:35.487
Hey, Larry.

43:35.662 --> 43:38.130
So I was thinking
maybe I'll give it one more night.

43:38.297 --> 43:40.288
I'm glad you came around.
Welcome back.

43:40.466 --> 43:43.560
You. New night guard, here, now.

43:51.744 --> 43:53.939
- What's up?
- "What's up? "

43:54.113 --> 43:57.640
Oh, well, take a walk with me
and I'll show you, Mr. "What's up? "

43:57.817 --> 43:59.250
Come on.

44:00.753 --> 44:05.383
So would you kindly do me the favor
of explaining this?

44:09.095 --> 44:11.689
Okay. I'm guessing--

44:11.864 --> 44:16.528
And I'm just spitballing here,
but looks like that Roman dude got cocky...

44:16.703 --> 44:18.534
...and climbed over into the Wild West.

44:18.705 --> 44:21.833
And the cowboy knows Roman dude
wants to take over his territory...

44:22.008 --> 44:24.499
...so he rounded up a posse
and put him in the stockade.

44:26.646 --> 44:28.944
"Let's all laugh at me,
the comedy night guard."

44:29.382 --> 44:31.907
"No" is the answer.

44:32.085 --> 44:35.543
Sarcasm back at you,
with your humor box.

44:36.355 --> 44:38.255
I wasn't laughing. Pretending to laugh...

44:38.424 --> 44:41.860
...if that's what you want,
some sort of battle of humor.

44:42.028 --> 44:43.461
Do you?

44:44.997 --> 44:46.430
No.

44:47.166 --> 44:49.760
I don't want--
No, I don't want a battle of humor.

44:49.936 --> 44:52.871
No, you don't,
because it would be a bloodbath.

44:53.473 --> 44:55.464
Nothing funny about Little Bighorn.

44:58.177 --> 45:02.443
No. I find it about as funny
as a "fancist."

45:03.116 --> 45:08.179
It's not funny. Okay? And I will not
stand for this type of blatant...

45:09.622 --> 45:12.147
If I'm not clear, tell me.

45:14.560 --> 45:15.891
Am I clear?

45:16.796 --> 45:18.559
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

45:22.702 --> 45:24.033
Hey, Cecil?

45:25.304 --> 45:28.068
You got an extra copy
of that instruction manual?

45:28.241 --> 45:32.337
Oh, no. I'm afraid not, Larry.
Listen, I'll tell you what you do.

45:32.512 --> 45:35.072
Read some books.
Brush up on your history.

45:35.248 --> 45:37.512
Helped me a lot when I first started out.

45:39.152 --> 45:42.986
This museum was originally dedicated
to that man on the horse up there...

45:43.156 --> 45:44.680
...President Theodore Roosevelt.

45:44.857 --> 45:48.918
He absolutely loved history and believed
that the more you know about the past...

45:49.095 --> 45:51.996
...the better prepared you are
for the future.

45:53.499 --> 45:57.094
Okay, kids. Who can tell me
what this room's called?

45:57.270 --> 45:59.670
Very good. The Hall of African Mammals.

45:59.839 --> 46:02.672
Right here we have the king of the jungle,
the lion.

46:03.276 --> 46:07.372
Up ahead is one of my favorite creatures
in the whole museum, the capuchin monkey.

46:07.547 --> 46:12.507
A highly intelligent primate
known for its loving and generous nature.

46:16.455 --> 46:17.786
Excuse me?

46:17.957 --> 46:20.949
I just thought that was...

46:21.127 --> 46:23.823
I just was laughing in agreement.

46:26.032 --> 46:27.795
Happy monkey.

46:29.602 --> 46:31.331
All right, kids. This way.

46:36.642 --> 46:38.769
Let me tell you something.
I'm not buying it.

46:38.945 --> 46:42.437
You might have them fooled,
you might have the kids fooled. Not me.

46:42.615 --> 46:46.016
Can't get past me.
There's a storm coming, buddy.

46:46.185 --> 46:47.675
There's a storm coming.

46:50.589 --> 46:53.820
One of the most famous trackers
in history, Sakagawea was the woman...

46:53.992 --> 46:57.257
...who led Lewis and Clark on
their expedition to find the Pacific Ocean.

46:57.429 --> 47:00.694
You guys have heard the saying,
"Actions speak louder than words."

47:00.866 --> 47:02.891
And yet they wrote--

47:03.068 --> 47:05.798
- Yes, Mr. Daley?
- Yes. Was she deaf?

47:07.072 --> 47:10.906
Was she deaf? No. She was not.
But she--

47:11.076 --> 47:16.378
Yeah, because-- Just-- She does seem
a little bit sort of unresponsive.

47:16.548 --> 47:18.175
That's because she's a statue.

47:20.352 --> 47:24.118
Kids, could you give me one sec?
Go check her out. She's really cool.

47:26.158 --> 47:28.592
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna be here every night.

47:28.760 --> 47:31.593
I wanted to learn a little bit more
about what I'm guarding.

47:31.763 --> 47:33.754
Actually, I've got a bunch of questions.

47:33.932 --> 47:36.833
Maybe when you have a break,
could I buy you a cup of coffee?

47:37.002 --> 47:38.333
A cup of coffee?

47:38.503 --> 47:40.733
Yeah, I mean, just purely a, you know...

47:40.906 --> 47:45.400
...colleague-to-colleague,
information-download sort of coffee.

47:46.511 --> 47:48.502
I finish in 20 minutes.
I'll meet you outside.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.170
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

47:50.349 --> 47:53.147
- And have a good rest of your--
- All right. Okay, kids.

47:54.086 --> 47:55.747
It was incredible what she did.

47:55.921 --> 47:59.118
She literally led these men
across rivers, up mountains...

47:59.291 --> 48:02.852
...all with her newborn baby on her back.
She was the ultimate working mother.

48:03.028 --> 48:05.360
Wow, you are quite
the Sakagawean expert.

48:05.530 --> 48:07.589
- Sakagawean.
- Sakagawean?

48:07.766 --> 48:12.032
Yeah. I should be, I've been writing
my dissertation on her for four years.

48:12.204 --> 48:16.140
You've been working on one paper
for four years? That would drive me crazy.

48:16.308 --> 48:20.404
Actually, it's more like a 900-page book.

48:21.013 --> 48:24.972
So, what's your story? Have you
always wanted to be a security guard?

48:25.817 --> 48:29.014
- Oh, I didn't mean to--
- No, no, no.

48:29.187 --> 48:33.021
No, I'm divorced
and I have a 10-year-old son...

48:33.191 --> 48:36.991
...so I needed to find
a more steady situation.

48:37.162 --> 48:40.188
Got it. So, what can I tell you
about the museum?

48:40.365 --> 48:43.391
Okay, Attila the Hun.
What is that guy's problem?

48:43.568 --> 48:46.628
Attila was considered the only
genuine threat to the Roman Empire.

48:47.239 --> 48:50.072
" Known as the 'Scourge of God'...

48:50.242 --> 48:54.838
...Attila and his Huns would often
tear off the limbs of their helpless victims.

48:56.882 --> 48:59.214
Attila was famous
for his superstitious beliefs.

48:59.384 --> 49:03.445
He surrounded himself with a phalanx
of sorcerers and magicians...

49:03.622 --> 49:06.853
...who advised and mystified him
with their dark arts."

49:59.544 --> 50:01.034
Larry?

50:01.346 --> 50:03.007
Just wanted to say good luck, son.

50:03.248 --> 50:05.773
And goodbye.
We're clocking out for the last time.

50:05.951 --> 50:07.543
If you're ever in Boca, look us up.

50:07.719 --> 50:10.916
Wait, you guys are going out of town?
What if this doesn't work out?

50:11.089 --> 50:13.614
Smart fellow like you? You'll be fine.

50:13.792 --> 50:18.320
Yeah. We'll just be a phone call away.
Come on, walk us out.

50:18.497 --> 50:21.364
You fellas go ahead.

50:22.567 --> 50:24.228
I need a moment.

50:24.402 --> 50:29.066
He's very emotional.
A lot of memories in this room.

51:25.297 --> 51:27.424
Go crazy, big guy.

51:32.604 --> 51:34.265
Hey, guys.

51:34.439 --> 51:36.407
Quest for fire...

51:36.908 --> 51:40.105
...over. Knock yourselves out.

51:41.947 --> 51:43.278
Morning, dum-dum.

51:43.448 --> 51:47.145
Me no dum-dum. You dum-dum.
You bring me gum-gum?

51:47.319 --> 51:51.380
Yes, I did, fathead.
Lots and lots of gum-gum.

52:11.176 --> 52:16.307
What's that?
I can't hear you through the glass.

52:18.216 --> 52:19.808
Sorry.

52:20.418 --> 52:22.113
Heave.

52:22.587 --> 52:25.522
Heave. Heave.

52:25.690 --> 52:28.250
Hey, what's going on over here?

52:28.426 --> 52:30.758
We expand or we die.

52:31.062 --> 52:33.223
Heave.

52:33.398 --> 52:34.922
- Heave.
- On the count of three...

52:35.100 --> 52:38.536
...you blow this anthill to kingdom come.

52:39.104 --> 52:42.505
- And a one and a two--
- Hey, Jed. Stop that.

52:42.674 --> 52:46.508
No, no. You blow a hole in your mountain,
all you're gonna hit is a wall.

52:46.678 --> 52:51.012
Step aside, Gigantor. We got us a railroad
to build. We're blowing a hole in that thing.

52:51.182 --> 52:54.515
Okay, first of all, enough with
the Gigantor giant stuff, okay?

52:54.686 --> 52:58.452
- I'm just trying to close up shop.
- We're gonna blow it anyway. And a three!

52:59.925 --> 53:03.520
Yeah. What are you doing?

53:03.828 --> 53:06.956
What's it look like we're doing?
It's manifest destiny.

53:07.132 --> 53:10.932
You can't fight it and neither can l.
Go! More dynamite.

53:11.136 --> 53:13.604
- Yeah, use it all.
- All right. Okay.

53:13.772 --> 53:16.434
Listen, "Octavus"? You gotta stop that.

53:16.608 --> 53:18.542
It's Octavius, mary.

53:18.710 --> 53:22.373
Okay, you know what? Fine. Great.
Here you go. This is what happens.

53:22.547 --> 53:24.777
- You cannot do this. I am a Roman general.
- Sorry.

53:24.950 --> 53:26.212
- I have rights.
- And you.

53:26.384 --> 53:28.875
- Hey, no! Put me down!
- Keep heaving, men.

53:29.054 --> 53:30.351
You can't stop progress!

53:30.522 --> 53:32.717
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

53:33.458 --> 53:35.892
I told you, I don't like to be manhandled.

53:36.061 --> 53:39.656
No, I will manhandle you, Jedediah.
Now, listen, guys.

53:39.831 --> 53:42.391
What is your problem, huh?
Why can't you just get along?

53:42.634 --> 53:44.966
Look, we're men. We fight, okay?
That's what we do.

53:45.136 --> 53:46.728
It's kind of how we pass the time.

53:46.972 --> 53:51.272
You're, like, a giant. A freak, if you will.
We can't expect you to understand that.

53:51.443 --> 53:55.106
You got the whole room to run around in.
You don't have to be near each other.

53:55.714 --> 53:59.411
- What, you mean...?
- You're gonna let us out?

53:59.951 --> 54:02.317
What, and just roam free?

54:03.054 --> 54:05.614
Yeah. Yeah, I might,
if you promise to behave.

54:05.790 --> 54:08.918
That means no fireballs,
no explosions, okay?

54:09.094 --> 54:10.322
You have my word, my liege.

54:10.495 --> 54:13.157
Yeah, no problemo, Gigantor.

54:13.331 --> 54:17.233
My name's Larry, first of all. Okay, Jed?

54:17.402 --> 54:20.132
So I call you Jed.
I don't call you Tiny, right?

54:20.305 --> 54:21.863
What's that supposed to mean?

54:22.040 --> 54:27.637
- "Hey, Teeny." How does that sound?
- I don't like it. It hurts my feelings.

54:27.812 --> 54:30.542
"Gigantor" makes me feel
like some sort of freak, so...

54:30.715 --> 54:33.183
I don't. I just call you Larry.

54:33.351 --> 54:35.342
Don't be a kiss-ass, okay?

54:35.520 --> 54:37.351
Look, I'm trusting you guys, all right?

54:37.522 --> 54:40.958
If you don't do what I say,
you can end up like the Mayan world there.

54:41.159 --> 54:43.218
Locked up. Take a look.

54:43.395 --> 54:46.592
- Do they look happy?
- No.

54:47.832 --> 54:49.197
They look sad.

54:49.367 --> 54:52.427
They can't do what they wanna do.
Now, I'm letting you guys...

54:52.604 --> 54:55.835
...have a little bit of leash here.
Don't choke me with it, okay?

54:56.007 --> 55:00.171
I gotta run. You guys play nice, okay?
Okay. Good. Thanks.

55:01.913 --> 55:04.143
Hey, how's that gum treating you,
dum-dum?

55:04.315 --> 55:05.646
Good.

55:09.054 --> 55:11.852
Oh, hey, Dexter.
I'm just locking up. You want in?

55:13.525 --> 55:15.117
Yeah?

55:16.728 --> 55:18.320
All right.

55:24.302 --> 55:26.202
What's that? You got my keys?

55:28.807 --> 55:30.206
I don't think so.

55:32.143 --> 55:36.637
Looks like Uncle Larry pulled a fast one
on little Dexie.

55:36.815 --> 55:38.806
Those are baby keys for a little baby.

55:38.983 --> 55:41.178
Have fun with your baby keys,
little baby monkey.

55:41.352 --> 55:44.788
Tomorrow I'll bring you a little baby diapy
so you can go poo-poo in it.

55:44.956 --> 55:47.288
I'll give you a tickle
because you're a cute baby.

55:47.459 --> 55:52.260
While you cry all night long
about how Uncle Larry fooled you, huh?

55:52.730 --> 55:54.755
I told you there was a storm coming.

56:02.173 --> 56:04.403
- Hey, Teddy.
- Lawrence.

56:04.576 --> 56:07.170
You impertinent pup.
I knew you'd come back.

56:07.412 --> 56:11.075
- You look like a man on a mission.
- Yeah, I'm gonna give it another shot.

56:18.990 --> 56:21.584
- You...?
- What?

56:21.759 --> 56:25.058
- You checking her out?
- The nerve.

56:25.230 --> 56:28.222
Checking her out.
I've never heard of such a thing.

56:28.399 --> 56:32.335
No, no, no. I'm just-- I mean
because, you know, she's very beautiful.

56:32.504 --> 56:34.233
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

56:38.309 --> 56:40.903
- Rather handsome woman, I suppose.
- Yeah.

56:41.346 --> 56:43.906
I don't know,
maybe you should go talk to her.

56:44.082 --> 56:46.676
- lndeed. Bless you, lad.
- Yeah. All right.

56:46.851 --> 56:49.718
- Carry on.
- Good. See you.

57:06.838 --> 57:08.601
I...

57:56.321 --> 57:57.982
Hey, hi.

57:58.690 --> 58:02.285
No! It's okay!
It's okay. You guys speak English?

58:02.694 --> 58:03.820
No?

58:06.631 --> 58:08.326
Right. I don't know what that means...

58:08.499 --> 58:12.595
...and I know that you and I got off
on the wrong foot last night, but...

58:14.505 --> 58:19.169
...a little birdie told me
that somebody likes...

58:20.011 --> 58:21.239
...magic.

58:21.412 --> 58:24.347
- Magic?
- Magic.

58:25.183 --> 58:26.878
Sorcery.

58:27.185 --> 58:28.584
Ah, sorcer--

58:28.753 --> 58:31.187
Yes. Illusion.

58:31.522 --> 58:33.012
Everybody likes magic.

58:33.191 --> 58:37.150
And flowers. People like flowers.

58:37.328 --> 58:38.852
There you go. Those are for you.

58:39.030 --> 58:41.590
You know what else people like?
Money.

58:41.766 --> 58:46.135
The almighty dollar, right?
But money can sometimes...

58:47.038 --> 58:48.369
...disappear.

58:51.209 --> 58:53.200
At least that's what l...

58:53.911 --> 58:55.139
...hear.

58:56.748 --> 59:00.479
No wonder you can't understand me.
You got a coin in your ear.

59:03.888 --> 59:06.550
Check this out. Anybody need a hanky?

59:06.891 --> 59:11.225
Well, I wouldn't suggest this little
feller because he has a nasty habit...

59:11.729 --> 59:14.061
...of vanishing...

59:16.167 --> 59:18.135
...into thin air!

59:19.070 --> 59:21.402
No, no. Don't. That defeats the-- Don't!

59:39.257 --> 59:43.591
Not the limbs. Guys, please,
do not tear the limbs.

01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:01.942
Cortes, right?

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.190
How?

01:00:21.632 --> 01:00:24.499
You! Don't even think about it.
Don't you--

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:26.837
Dexter!

01:00:37.315 --> 01:00:38.805
Come on, guys!

01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:05.800
Hey, guys!

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:12.505
Hey, guys. Hey, guys!

01:01:14.619 --> 01:01:16.553
Sorry. What's going on?
What happened here?

01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:18.052
I thought we had a deal.

01:01:18.222 --> 01:01:20.452
We will never coexist
with these buffoons.

01:01:20.625 --> 01:01:22.559
We're past words, Laredo.

01:01:22.727 --> 01:01:25.787
Now it's time to let Smith & Wesson
do the talking!

01:01:25.963 --> 01:01:27.260
Those guns don't even work.

01:01:27.432 --> 01:01:29.696
They don't? Take a look at this.

01:01:32.804 --> 01:01:34.032
Dexter!

01:02:23.454 --> 01:02:24.716
Why?

01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:33.689
Ho! Dexter.

01:02:41.239 --> 01:02:43.298
End of the line, cool breeze.

01:02:44.876 --> 01:02:46.309
End of the line.

01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:06.426
I am not playing games here.

01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:12.296
Just hand them over.

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:19.806
Easy. That's it, Dexter.

01:03:19.977 --> 01:03:22.138
Nice and easy, Dex. That's it.

01:03:44.335 --> 01:03:46.895
Good Lord, Lawrence!
Why are you slapping a monkey?

01:03:47.505 --> 01:03:50.804
Teddy, this guy's been pushing me,
and I'm sick of it!

01:03:51.008 --> 01:03:54.034
Poppycock. This little creature is
your primate brother.

01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:56.008
Without him, there's no us.

01:03:56.547 --> 01:03:57.844
Are you rabid?

01:03:58.049 --> 01:03:59.676
Wipe that off.

01:04:00.418 --> 01:04:03.046
You have to deal with this creature
with love and respect.

01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:05.051
May I have the keys, dear friend?

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:08.924
Thank you. Lawrence?

01:04:11.028 --> 01:04:12.222
Well, you know what?

01:04:12.396 --> 01:04:15.490
You seem to know what you're doing,
so I'm gonna let you take over.

01:04:15.666 --> 01:04:18.726
No, no. My dear boy, you can't put up
the white flag now.

01:04:18.903 --> 01:04:20.894
The museum is on the verge
of total anarchy.

01:04:21.072 --> 01:04:22.801
I tried! I came back tonight,
didn't l?

01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:26.341
Tried? That was one night. I didn't build
the Panama Canal in one day.

01:04:26.544 --> 01:04:29.707
That's great, but I'm dealing with
the most ridiculous job in history.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.438
Some men are born great, Lawrence--

01:04:31.616 --> 01:04:34.050
Yeah, I know. Others have
greatness thrust upon them.

01:04:34.318 --> 01:04:36.149
You hit me with that chestnut
last night.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.845
The thing is, not everyone is great.

01:04:39.023 --> 01:04:41.617
That's the problem.
Some of us are just ordinary.

01:04:41.826 --> 01:04:44.454
No, you're not, Lawrence.
Stop wallowing in self-pity.

01:04:44.629 --> 01:04:46.324
Every journey begins with a footstep.

01:04:46.497 --> 01:04:49.762
Teach the inhabitants to get along,
they wouldn't need to be locked up.

01:04:49.934 --> 01:04:52.994
That means a lot coming from a guy
who's spent the last 50 years...

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:55.434
...spying on a girl he's never even
talked to.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.232
I was going to make contact.
Lawrence, please.

01:05:00.077 --> 01:05:01.908
I'm done, all right?

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.481
No, Rexy! No!

01:05:41.118 --> 01:05:43.211
Oh, no.

01:06:46.517 --> 01:06:48.348
All right.

01:06:57.428 --> 01:07:01.228
No one comes here anymore. Besides,
I took this tour in second grade, Daley.

01:07:01.398 --> 01:07:03.798
I'm telling you,
my dad's gonna hook us up.

01:07:04.101 --> 01:07:06.399
- Mr. Daley?
- Yeah?

01:07:07.872 --> 01:07:09.772
- Foam.
- Yes, I know.

01:07:09.974 --> 01:07:11.271
In the Neanderthal display.

01:07:11.442 --> 01:07:14.411
There was an incident last night
with the fire extinguisher.

01:07:14.578 --> 01:07:16.205
I was on my way to go clean it up.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.848
Okay, don't bother. You're fired.

01:07:20.651 --> 01:07:22.846
I don't think we're getting a tour today.

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.045
Your dad just got canned, dude.

01:07:26.557 --> 01:07:28.582
Excuse me?

01:07:28.959 --> 01:07:30.551
Mr. McPhee?

01:07:31.428 --> 01:07:32.861
Excuse me, Mr. McPhee?

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:35.362
Can I talk to you about this, please?

01:07:35.533 --> 01:07:36.659
- Sir?
- What?

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:39.735
I know I screwed up, but I finally
understand how to do this job.

01:07:39.904 --> 01:07:43.032
- You obviously don't.
- No, I didn't, but now I do.

01:07:43.207 --> 01:07:45.971
- Really, Mr. McPhee--
- Doctor.

01:07:46.777 --> 01:07:48.574
Dr. McPhee.

01:07:49.513 --> 01:07:51.413
Can you please give me one more night?

01:07:54.151 --> 01:07:56.346
- One more night.
- Okay, thank you.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.853
And if anything is the tiniest...

01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:02.786
...after your shift:

01:08:04.795 --> 01:08:06.092
Because...

01:08:09.099 --> 01:08:10.794
- Got it.
- Okay?

01:08:10.968 --> 01:08:14.699
Fool me once, shame on you.
Fool me twice...

01:08:19.609 --> 01:08:22.841
Shame on me. Fool me--
Shame on me.

01:08:23.013 --> 01:08:25.481
- You.
- Fool me twice... Got it.

01:08:25.716 --> 01:08:28.412
- Take it or leave it.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:08:33.256 --> 01:08:34.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:34.625 --> 01:08:37.752
- What's wrong?
- Maybe you should ask Nicky.

01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:43.027
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

01:08:43.634 --> 01:08:45.192
You got fired.

01:08:45.636 --> 01:08:47.796
What are you talking about?
I didn't get fired.

01:08:49.206 --> 01:08:53.040
I came to the museum this morning.
I saw your boss yelling at you.

01:08:53.978 --> 01:08:56.674
Why didn't you tell me?
Everything's fine.

01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:58.906
We just had a little misunderstanding.

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:00.482
Why?

01:09:01.852 --> 01:09:04.844
It's hard to explain.
I mean, you wouldn't bel--

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:09.115
You know what? Let me show you.

01:09:09.526 --> 01:09:11.790
- Show me what?
- Come to work with me tonight.

01:09:11.962 --> 01:09:13.292
Larry?

01:09:13.464 --> 01:09:16.160
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:09:19.303 --> 01:09:20.600
Am I in trouble?

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:22.533
Larry, what are you doing?

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:25.072
I just wanna show him what I do.
That's all.

01:09:25.242 --> 01:09:28.268
I love that you wanna share that
with him, but I gotta tell you...

01:09:28.444 --> 01:09:31.971
...I don't think Nicky has any room
in his heart for more disappointment.

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:34.942
He won't be disappointed.

01:09:35.685 --> 01:09:36.983
Larry.

01:09:37.554 --> 01:09:39.522
He won't be disappointed.

01:09:45.662 --> 01:09:48.529
Listen, hang out in the security
office till everyone's gone.

01:09:48.698 --> 01:09:50.428
Then I'm gonna come get you.
All right?

01:10:10.454 --> 01:10:13.651
Hey, miss? I'm gonna have to ask you
to vacate the premises.

01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:15.121
- Hey there.
- Hey.

01:10:16.794 --> 01:10:19.922
- Good place to think, huh?
- Yeah. Definitely.

01:10:21.065 --> 01:10:23.556
So no big plans tonight?

01:10:23.734 --> 01:10:26.567
Yeah, no, I'm not really
a big-plan person.

01:10:26.904 --> 01:10:29.668
I prefer hanging out with people
who are dead for 200 years.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.467
It's the live ones that throw me.

01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:35.476
That's cool. Seriously though,
you do have to leave.

01:10:35.679 --> 01:10:37.738
- Seriously?
- Yeah, sorry. It's museum rules.

01:10:37.915 --> 01:10:40.543
We're sort of locking everything up.

01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:43.915
You're really taking your job seriously.

01:10:44.088 --> 01:10:47.489
You know, once I clip on the tie,
I'm all business.

01:10:47.658 --> 01:10:48.852
- I get it.
- Yeah.

01:10:49.026 --> 01:10:50.857
How's that dissertation coming?

01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:55.528
I've hit a dead end. I mean,
research can only get me so far.

01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:57.599
I'm never gonna know
who she really was.

01:10:58.268 --> 01:11:02.432
So I think it's time that I move on
to another subject.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.735
I'll let you get back to work.

01:11:06.443 --> 01:11:09.970
- Good night, Larry.
- Yeah, okay.

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.011
Night.

01:11:19.123 --> 01:11:20.522
Hey.

01:11:22.126 --> 01:11:23.753
Rebecca!

01:11:26.296 --> 01:11:28.526
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hey.

01:11:28.699 --> 01:11:31.930
Hey. Listen, I don't think you should
give up on your paper.

01:11:32.136 --> 01:11:33.933
Okay. Why?

01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:36.868
All right, look, this is gonna
sound crazy, all right?

01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:39.635
I mean, it's gonna sound, like,
really, really crazy.

01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:42.506
- Okay.
- No, I mean insanely crazy.

01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:44.306
- I can handle it.
- Okay.

01:11:45.315 --> 01:11:49.046
You know how they say in certain
museums, history comes alive?

01:11:49.219 --> 01:11:52.086
- Yeah.
- ln this museum...

01:11:52.956 --> 01:11:54.480
...it actually does.

01:11:56.293 --> 01:11:57.920
What are you talking about?

01:12:02.399 --> 01:12:06.836
Everything in this museum
comes to life at night.

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.468
- Really?
- Yeah, really. I'm not kidding you.

01:12:13.644 --> 01:12:15.771
You know that tablet?
The Tablet of Ahkmenrah?

01:12:15.946 --> 01:12:18.915
It actually brings things to life.
It's like some ancient spell.

01:12:19.083 --> 01:12:21.813
Since the '50s, every night
everything's been coming to life.

01:12:21.985 --> 01:12:27.082
Teddy Roosevelt told me. Seriously.
The monkey, Dexter? The cute little--

01:12:27.257 --> 01:12:28.724
- What is he?
- Capuchin.

01:12:28.892 --> 01:12:32.191
A capuchin. Right. The capuchin.
He urinated on me and bit my nose.

01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:37.066
And Sakagawea is in her case,
alive every night...

01:12:37.234 --> 01:12:39.429
...just listening to Lewis and Clark
argue.

01:12:39.603 --> 01:12:42.037
So if you really wanna get inside
her head...

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.305
...I can hook that up.

01:12:46.844 --> 01:12:48.106
That's cool.

01:12:48.278 --> 01:12:51.406
Yeah, it's cool. It's freaking awesome.

01:12:54.785 --> 01:12:56.719
Make fun of the history geek.

01:12:57.688 --> 01:13:00.555
- No. Rebecca!
- Good night, Larry.

01:13:02.593 --> 01:13:05.391
No, I'm not making fun of you.
Rebecca.

01:13:16.373 --> 01:13:18.841
- Here you go. Best seat in the house.
- What's going on?

01:13:19.009 --> 01:13:21.569
If I told you, you'd think I'm crazy.
I'm gonna show you.

01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:25.272
- What?
- You'll see in about 20 seconds.

01:13:25.449 --> 01:13:27.280
- Okay, you like Tyrannosaurus Rex?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:29.919
Yeah? Well, I call him Rexy.

01:13:30.087 --> 01:13:34.581
And he's about to come to life,
Nicholas, in...

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:41.954
...five, four, three, two...

01:13:49.106 --> 01:13:51.574
- Dad?
- Hang on a sec.

01:13:51.775 --> 01:13:55.142
Say hello to Rexy!

01:13:56.313 --> 01:13:57.405
Dad, are you okay?

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.307
This is weird.

01:14:01.485 --> 01:14:03.612
Guys! Come on!

01:14:04.154 --> 01:14:05.985
Sundown!

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:11.561
Hey, T.R., come on, rise and shine.
Buddy, I need you to wake up.

01:14:11.728 --> 01:14:13.821
Come on, my kid is here.
I need you to wake up.

01:14:13.997 --> 01:14:17.125
Texas? Texas! Come on!
Texas! Come on! Get on, Texas!

01:14:17.467 --> 01:14:19.196
Get on, Texas! Get up.

01:14:19.369 --> 01:14:21.496
Just stop, okay?

01:14:21.672 --> 01:14:25.130
No, Nicky, I'm telling you,
there's this tablet, okay?

01:14:25.309 --> 01:14:27.402
Called the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Every night--

01:14:27.578 --> 01:14:30.240
- Now there's a tablet?
- Yeah, there is.

01:14:30.414 --> 01:14:31.972
Come on, Dad.

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:35.044
Come on.

01:14:39.556 --> 01:14:41.490
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

01:14:41.658 --> 01:14:45.116
The tablet. I think somebody stole it.

01:14:45.495 --> 01:14:47.190
Yeah, right.

01:14:47.497 --> 01:14:49.192
I'm not kidding, Nicky.

01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:54.201
Nicky?

01:14:56.139 --> 01:14:58.107
Hey, Nicky!

01:14:59.543 --> 01:15:02.307
Hey! Hey, Nicky! Where are you going?

01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:05.414
- Home.
- What? Wait a minute.

01:15:09.886 --> 01:15:11.353
Come on.

01:15:20.364 --> 01:15:22.628
You guys shouldn't be here.

01:15:22.799 --> 01:15:24.027
Give us the tablet, son.

01:15:24.201 --> 01:15:26.192
Wait a minute, Nicky.
What are you guys doing?

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:28.600
We're not gonna hurt you.
Give us the tablet.

01:15:28.772 --> 01:15:31.741
I'm sorry to tell you this, son,
but your dad doesn't work here.

01:15:31.908 --> 01:15:34.968
He got fired this morning.
Couldn't hack it.

01:15:35.145 --> 01:15:38.080
Dad? I thought you said
you weren't fired.

01:15:38.248 --> 01:15:40.614
I did. They're lying,
trying to steal that thing.

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:43.446
Turn the middle piece,
you'll see what I was talking about.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:45.485
That is museum property, son.
Give it back.

01:15:45.656 --> 01:15:47.590
Nicky, trust me. Just turn it.

01:15:47.791 --> 01:15:49.918
- Give us the tablet!
- Nicky?

01:15:50.627 --> 01:15:52.060
Trust me.

01:16:14.484 --> 01:16:15.951
Nick? Run. Now.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.020
Get back here, kid!

01:16:21.725 --> 01:16:23.420
Bad idea, Larry.

01:16:23.827 --> 01:16:26.352
You wanna dance, hot dog?
You wanna dance?

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:28.657
Gus, you're an old man.
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:16:31.001 --> 01:16:34.732
You see, Larry, a few years into
the job, the three of us realized that...

01:16:34.905 --> 01:16:39.035
...Iike everything else in this museum,
we got new life at night.

01:16:39.209 --> 01:16:42.440
Sundown to sunrise,
we felt young again.

01:16:44.681 --> 01:16:46.205
Okay. Did not see that coming.

01:16:46.383 --> 01:16:48.044
Gave us an energy boost.

01:16:48.218 --> 01:16:50.482
We love the nightlife, Larry.

01:16:50.654 --> 01:16:52.815
So when we found out
they were gonna fired us...

01:16:52.989 --> 01:16:54.456
...we had to steal the tablet.

01:16:54.624 --> 01:16:56.649
Everyone knows you need the money.

01:16:56.827 --> 01:16:58.692
Add the stuff we planted
in your place...

01:16:58.862 --> 01:17:00.989
...pretty obvious you committed
the crime.

01:17:01.164 --> 01:17:03.064
Take care of that cut.

01:17:03.233 --> 01:17:05.201
Come on, guys, let's go find that kid.

01:17:07.170 --> 01:17:09.195
- Sweet dreams, cupcake!
- No!

01:17:09.373 --> 01:17:10.806
Pile driver!

01:17:11.641 --> 01:17:13.541
Let's get our tablet.

01:17:39.336 --> 01:17:41.668
Thank you very much.
We'll take it from here.

01:17:41.872 --> 01:17:43.396
Nicky!

01:17:45.409 --> 01:17:48.207
Just in time, Larry.
We were just locking up.

01:17:49.713 --> 01:17:51.806
Sleep tight, hotshot.

01:17:53.617 --> 01:17:55.517
Let's grab everything we can fence.

01:17:55.685 --> 01:17:59.985
I don't know about you,
but I'm planning on a long retirement.

01:18:07.964 --> 01:18:11.422
Teddy! Teddy, if you're out there,
I need you, pal!

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:15.164
Someone call my name?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.406
Theodore Roosevelt, at your service.

01:18:19.576 --> 01:18:21.441
Teddy, can you get us out of here?

01:18:21.611 --> 01:18:23.875
Can't do it, man. This is your moment.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:26.571
Will you save the lectures, please?
I'm not you. Okay?

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:30.208
I didn't build the Panama Canal,
I wasn't president of the United States!

01:18:30.387 --> 01:18:31.581
I need some help. Come on.

01:18:31.755 --> 01:18:33.518
Actually...

01:18:35.559 --> 01:18:39.518
...I never did any of those things.
Teddy Roosevelt did.

01:18:39.696 --> 01:18:42.563
I was made in a mannequin factory
in Poughkeepsie.

01:18:42.732 --> 01:18:44.597
I never shot a wild beast.

01:18:44.768 --> 01:18:47.999
I'm not even brave enough to tell
that beautiful woman I love her.

01:18:48.472 --> 01:18:49.803
But you...

01:18:50.574 --> 01:18:54.101
...you gotta finish the job this time.
You can't quit.

01:18:56.913 --> 01:18:58.881
I'm made of wax, Larry.

01:18:59.583 --> 01:19:01.346
What are you made of?

01:19:05.255 --> 01:19:08.588
- Wait! That's all you got for me?
- That's it!

01:19:20.937 --> 01:19:22.928
That's it. Come on.

01:19:23.773 --> 01:19:25.104
Duck!

01:19:26.776 --> 01:19:28.266
Go over there!

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:51.726
Hey. Hi. How you doing?
Sorry to bother you...

01:19:51.902 --> 01:19:54.200
...but your guys there? Your jackal guys?

01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:56.669
Do you think you could ask them
to back off, please?

01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:00.139
We're not trying to hurt you, they think
we are. Could you do it like now?

01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:08.476
Thank you. Nicky.

01:20:09.219 --> 01:20:10.481
Thank you.

01:20:18.428 --> 01:20:19.827
Dad?

01:20:31.174 --> 01:20:33.699
You would not believe how stuffy
it is in there.

01:20:35.779 --> 01:20:38.805
- How come you speak English?
- I went to Cambridge University.

01:20:38.982 --> 01:20:40.074
You went to Cambridge?

01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:42.844
I was on display
in the Egyptology Department.

01:20:43.987 --> 01:20:46.547
I am Ahkmenrah, fourth king
of the fourth king...

01:20:46.723 --> 01:20:49.248
...ruler of the land of my fathers.

01:20:49.859 --> 01:20:52.020
I am Larry...

01:20:53.496 --> 01:20:55.327
...son of Milton...

01:20:55.498 --> 01:20:58.865
...and this is my son, Nick.

01:20:59.035 --> 01:21:01.526
And we hail from Brooklyn.

01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:05.136
Well, I do. I mean, he comes out and
stays with me on Wednesdays...

01:21:05.308 --> 01:21:06.570
...and every other weekend.

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:11.544
That was the custody agreement
that we had.

01:21:12.015 --> 01:21:15.712
Larry, Nick, guardians of Brooklyn...

01:21:15.885 --> 01:21:17.750
...I am forever in your debt.

01:21:17.921 --> 01:21:20.515
Now bestow the tablet upon me...

01:21:20.690 --> 01:21:23.215
...so that I may assume command
of my kingdom.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.029
Oh, yes. Okay, the tablet. I would...

01:21:27.197 --> 01:21:30.564
...Iove to bestow it upon you,
but we don't actually...

01:21:31.101 --> 01:21:32.432
...have it.

01:21:40.577 --> 01:21:43.341
Thanks, guys. Don't worry.
I'll watch out for him!

01:21:43.513 --> 01:21:44.878
Thank you.

01:21:59.896 --> 01:22:01.591
What is that?

01:22:02.966 --> 01:22:04.627
Huns.

01:22:05.602 --> 01:22:07.399
I gotta deal with this guy.

01:22:44.107 --> 01:22:46.337
Pardon me, Larry. I speak Hun.

01:22:54.284 --> 01:22:56.184
He says that he wants to rip you apart.

01:22:56.352 --> 01:22:58.877
All right. Again with the ripping.
Listen, I understand.

01:22:59.055 --> 01:23:02.547
I get it. Ripping for you...
You want to rip things, okay?

01:23:02.726 --> 01:23:06.685
And I think maybe that's because
somebody ripped you a long time ago.

01:23:07.163 --> 01:23:08.653
In here.

01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:11.527
Somebody ripped little...

01:23:11.701 --> 01:23:14.670
...baby Attila a long time ago,
right here.

01:23:15.839 --> 01:23:19.240
They ripped something out,
didn't they?

01:23:21.010 --> 01:23:22.671
They ripped the love.

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:25.812
They ripped the love right out of you,
didn't they?

01:23:26.683 --> 01:23:30.244
A little baby all alone in a tent...

01:23:30.987 --> 01:23:33.319
...whose daddy went off...

01:23:34.157 --> 01:23:37.126
...to pillage some town...

01:23:37.293 --> 01:23:40.023
...or go and plunder somewhere,
just doing his job.

01:23:40.196 --> 01:23:42.323
But who was left alone?

01:23:45.702 --> 01:23:47.567
You.

01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:56.440
Let it out. Let it go. Let it go.

01:24:17.066 --> 01:24:20.661
It's okay. It's okay.

01:24:22.305 --> 01:24:24.500
You're next.

01:24:28.378 --> 01:24:31.245
Good. That's good. Just breathe.

01:24:35.251 --> 01:24:36.616
- Larry Daley.
- Yeah.

01:24:40.256 --> 01:24:42.121
Good. Yes.

01:24:42.692 --> 01:24:44.557
Yeah. Okay. Good, good.

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:49.262
All right!
I need everybody to listen up!

01:24:52.936 --> 01:24:54.403
Guys! Come on!

01:24:58.208 --> 01:25:04.511
Quiet!

01:25:14.290 --> 01:25:15.882
My dum-dum want to speak.

01:25:16.059 --> 01:25:17.856
Thank you.

01:25:18.728 --> 01:25:21.060
Now, this here's King Ahkmenrah.

01:25:21.231 --> 01:25:24.064
His tablet is what brings you to life
every night.

01:25:24.234 --> 01:25:27.032
And those old night watchmen?
They stole it.

01:25:27.437 --> 01:25:30.099
Now, we need to find those guards
and get the tablet back...

01:25:30.273 --> 01:25:32.173
...and we need to do it before morning.

01:25:32.342 --> 01:25:35.505
Civil War guys,
head over to the Planetarium Wing.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:40.513
My explorer friend
whose name escapes me.

01:25:40.683 --> 01:25:44.050
- It's Columbus.
- Right, Columbus! Right, I'm sorry.

01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:47.018
There's no nameplate, so...
Columbus, take the Neanderthals...

01:25:47.190 --> 01:25:50.125
...and do a sweep from lnvertebrates
all the way through Reptiles.

01:25:50.293 --> 01:25:53.285
Jed and Octavius, their van's parked
out back. Go take care of it.

01:25:53.463 --> 01:25:56.557
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no!
No, sir. I ain't working with toga boy.

01:25:56.733 --> 01:25:58.394
Romans work alone.

01:25:59.168 --> 01:26:01.295
- That didn't hurt. Don't be a baby.
- Yes, it did.

01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:02.699
Come on.

01:26:03.273 --> 01:26:04.934
That was much harder!

01:26:05.108 --> 01:26:06.575
Guys, come on!

01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:09.503
Jed, Octavius.

01:26:09.679 --> 01:26:11.977
Take away the fact you were born
2000 years apart...

01:26:12.148 --> 01:26:13.672
...you guys aren't that different.

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:16.445
You're both great leaders.

01:26:16.619 --> 01:26:18.849
You just want what's best
for your people, right?

01:26:19.022 --> 01:26:20.421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:22.114
Civil War dudes.

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:28.661
You guys are brothers, for God's sakes.
You gotta stop fighting.

01:26:29.065 --> 01:26:33.399
North wins. Slavery's bad. Sorry.

01:26:33.569 --> 01:26:39.030
Don't wanna burst your bubble.
But, South, you guys get Allman Brothers...

01:26:39.842 --> 01:26:42.834
...and NASCAR, so just chill!

01:26:44.147 --> 01:26:48.379
Look, without that tablet,
all of this...

01:26:48.551 --> 01:26:52.282
...this whole coming-to-life-at-night thing,
it all goes away.

01:26:52.455 --> 01:26:55.549
Now, I don't wanna let that happen,
but I need your help.

01:26:55.725 --> 01:26:58.057
We can get this done,
but we gotta do it together.

01:26:59.228 --> 01:27:00.422
So who's with me?

01:27:01.831 --> 01:27:03.492
Yeah.

01:27:03.666 --> 01:27:05.600
- Who's with me?
- Yeah!

01:27:05.768 --> 01:27:08.259
- Yeah!
- Charge!

01:27:09.672 --> 01:27:12.573
All right! Now, let's do this, people!

01:27:14.677 --> 01:27:15.974
And animals!

01:27:17.847 --> 01:27:21.578
And weird, faceless puppet creatures.
Come on, let's go! Let's do it!

01:27:44.607 --> 01:27:46.541
Come on! Follow me, boys!

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:48.404
Geronimo!

01:28:00.123 --> 01:28:01.988
Oh, jeez.

01:28:16.039 --> 01:28:20.237
Now, boys, we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

01:28:25.648 --> 01:28:27.912
I guess it's gonna be the hard way.

01:28:31.754 --> 01:28:35.554
Right, men, we're almost there.

01:28:55.912 --> 01:28:58.107
Save yourself!

01:28:58.281 --> 01:29:00.215
I ain't quitting you!

01:29:02.151 --> 01:29:03.709
Gus?

01:29:06.022 --> 01:29:07.216
Reginald?

01:29:07.657 --> 01:29:09.386
Fellas, where are you?

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.393
Guys?

01:29:22.905 --> 01:29:26.397
That's what I'm talking about.
Good job, gentlemen.

01:29:26.576 --> 01:29:28.043
Loving the teamwork!

01:29:48.131 --> 01:29:51.589
They've vanished.
How will we find them?

01:29:52.535 --> 01:29:54.628
I know someone who can help. Come on.

01:29:55.738 --> 01:29:57.569
Watch out!

01:30:04.247 --> 01:30:08.115
Hey, Sakagawea, or wea. Listen,
I need a favor. Somebody stole his tablet.

01:30:08.284 --> 01:30:10.775
You think you can track the guys
who took it?

01:30:11.454 --> 01:30:15.618
He went east
but he lost control and crashed.

01:30:16.225 --> 01:30:19.251
You're amazing. How can you tell that?

01:30:23.399 --> 01:30:25.390
He left the wagon...

01:30:25.568 --> 01:30:27.399
...and went back.

01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:29.401
He went back?

01:30:30.706 --> 01:30:32.139
Why would he go back?

01:30:34.877 --> 01:30:36.310
Get out of the way!

01:30:44.487 --> 01:30:46.011
You saved me.

01:30:46.422 --> 01:30:48.447
You're worth saving, my dear.

01:30:50.893 --> 01:30:53.521
- That's problematic.
- Teddy. Oh, man.

01:30:53.696 --> 01:30:55.891
Larry, relax. I'm wax.

01:30:56.065 --> 01:30:57.930
You gotta do something.
Dawn's approaching.

01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:01.365
- Half the museum's running amuck outside.
- He's got my tablet.

01:31:04.073 --> 01:31:06.166
Come on, Ockie!

01:31:12.215 --> 01:31:14.115
At your service, Gigantor!

01:31:14.283 --> 01:31:16.513
How can we be of assistance, my liege?

01:31:16.686 --> 01:31:18.881
Just give me a second, guys.

01:31:22.992 --> 01:31:24.687
Rexy?

01:31:26.062 --> 01:31:27.324
Here, boy.

01:31:27.496 --> 01:31:29.726
Teddy, I need a horse.

01:31:29.899 --> 01:31:31.560
Do it, man.

01:31:46.682 --> 01:31:50.243
- Come on, boy! Let me hear you yell!
- Yeah!

01:31:50.419 --> 01:31:52.284
Just living the dream, baby!

01:31:52.455 --> 01:31:54.082
I'm loving this!

01:31:57.693 --> 01:31:59.854
Pull the stagecoach over now!

01:32:02.765 --> 01:32:04.357
Can I make this turn up here?

01:32:06.435 --> 01:32:09.598
I'll take that as a yes. Hang on!

01:32:15.945 --> 01:32:17.776
I can't hold it!

01:32:31.294 --> 01:32:32.955
Come on, Tex, let's finish this.

01:32:34.363 --> 01:32:36.058
Come on!

01:32:40.836 --> 01:32:42.565
Give me the tablet, Cecil!

01:32:42.738 --> 01:32:44.228
Can't do it, son.

01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:49.177
Pull over!

01:32:49.345 --> 01:32:52.473
It ain't gonna happen. Moving on.

01:32:53.182 --> 01:32:55.844
Last chance, Cecil.
Stop the horses or I will!

01:32:56.118 --> 01:32:57.983
They can't be stopped, Larry.

01:32:58.154 --> 01:32:59.815
Don't you know your history?

01:32:59.989 --> 01:33:05.017
These are money carriers. They were trained
not to stop for anything but a secret word.

01:33:05.194 --> 01:33:07.094
Really? You mean a word like...

01:33:08.464 --> 01:33:10.091
..." Dakota"?

01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.101
Come on, Tex.

01:33:20.343 --> 01:33:22.675
I read up on my history.
Thanks for the tip.

01:33:23.112 --> 01:33:24.340
Oh, and by the way...

01:33:24.513 --> 01:33:27.004
...don't ever talk to me like that
in front of my son.

01:33:29.285 --> 01:33:30.980
Moving on.

01:33:35.057 --> 01:33:36.991
- Hey, Huns.
- Tell Attila to have his boys...

01:33:37.159 --> 01:33:39.150
...take him back.
Put him with the guards.

01:33:42.331 --> 01:33:45.095
Oh, and no limb ripping, okay?

01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:00.542
Hey, boy. Wait, wait, hold the phone.

01:34:00.716 --> 01:34:04.743
What's makeekaka mean?
Wait. Translation, please.

01:34:06.589 --> 01:34:10.491
The year was 1909. I was going up
the Zambezi River in Africa.

01:34:10.659 --> 01:34:13.719
And our river guide was a brilliant Pygmy
who spoke only by clicking.

01:34:21.804 --> 01:34:23.169
There we are.

01:34:26.876 --> 01:34:28.810
- Oh, boy.
- What is it?

01:34:28.978 --> 01:34:31.105
I gotta get you guys
back to the museum.

01:34:32.782 --> 01:34:34.044
How?

01:34:36.786 --> 01:34:39.186
Ahkmenrah, I'm gonna need your help.

01:34:39.355 --> 01:34:42.586
This is your tablet. You know
the instructions. You get everyone back.

01:35:10.653 --> 01:35:13.588
Come on. There's somebody
who's gotta see this.

01:35:16.025 --> 01:35:19.290
What I'm saying is, for the type of money
that they pay A-Rod...

01:35:19.462 --> 01:35:22.659
...he ought to be bringing home
a World Series trophy every season.

01:35:23.165 --> 01:35:24.894
You know what I mean?

01:35:43.352 --> 01:35:45.912
Now, who they gonna get
to clean up all that doo-doo?

01:35:46.088 --> 01:35:47.282
- lnuit.
- Yeah.

01:35:47.456 --> 01:35:49.151
One terracotta soldier.

01:35:49.325 --> 01:35:50.553
- Vikings.
- Right.

01:35:50.726 --> 01:35:52.717
- Alpaca.
- Welcome back, ladies.

01:35:52.895 --> 01:35:54.487
- Llama.
- Hey.

01:35:54.663 --> 01:35:55.994
Viking guys.

01:35:56.165 --> 01:35:58.633
Do me a favor. Your fellows
made some funeral pyre...

01:35:58.801 --> 01:36:00.928
...in Petrified Wood. Go clean that up.

01:36:01.103 --> 01:36:02.468
Okay? Thank you.

01:36:03.906 --> 01:36:06.568
- He's back.
- All right, I'll deal with this joker.

01:36:06.742 --> 01:36:09.870
Hey, hey, Moose.
It's not gonna happen, buddy. All right?

01:36:10.045 --> 01:36:12.479
I told you, you can't come through
with those antlers.

01:36:12.648 --> 01:36:15.674
So you and your caribou buddy
gotta go around to the loading dock.

01:36:15.851 --> 01:36:18.547
- Lawrence!
- Hey, Teddy.

01:36:19.221 --> 01:36:20.882
Great to see you in one piece.

01:36:21.056 --> 01:36:23.456
Sakagawea, a little hot wax,
and I'm a new man.

01:36:23.626 --> 01:36:25.321
Larry?

01:36:29.798 --> 01:36:32.062
I told you I wasn't making fun of you.

01:36:32.234 --> 01:36:34.896
- I know.
- Teddy?

01:36:36.472 --> 01:36:39.737
Oh, my God.

01:36:40.476 --> 01:36:42.171
Wanna meet her?

01:36:43.946 --> 01:36:45.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:36:45.314 --> 01:36:46.474
Okay, come on.

01:36:46.649 --> 01:36:49.846
Excuse me. President Roosevelt,
this is my friend Rebecca.

01:36:50.019 --> 01:36:51.646
- An honor.
- Hi.

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:53.651
And this is Sakagawea.

01:36:53.822 --> 01:36:55.050
- Wea.
- Wea.

01:36:55.224 --> 01:36:56.714
Wea.

01:36:56.892 --> 01:36:59.827
I think she has a few questions
she wants to ask you.

01:37:01.597 --> 01:37:03.827
You rock. I am a big fan.

01:37:05.301 --> 01:37:06.893
What would you like to know?

01:37:07.736 --> 01:37:10.534
Well, I mean,
I don't know where to start, but...

01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:24.442
- One Buddha.
- Check.

01:37:26.021 --> 01:37:28.353
Two zebras.

01:37:29.024 --> 01:37:32.357
- Right. Check.
- Dexter! Welcome back.

01:37:32.528 --> 01:37:35.395
Hey, Dex, so look.
No hard feelings, all right?

01:37:36.899 --> 01:37:38.457
- Lawrence!
- You saw!

01:37:38.634 --> 01:37:40.898
- You saw what he did just then!
- Who's evolved?

01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:42.867
- I am.
- Who's evolved?

01:37:43.038 --> 01:37:44.403
I am!

01:37:45.441 --> 01:37:46.806
Good.

01:37:47.576 --> 01:37:49.066
Well, they're all here.

01:37:49.244 --> 01:37:50.711
Well done. Everyone's in.

01:37:50.879 --> 01:37:52.540
Yeah, well...

01:37:52.781 --> 01:37:54.510
...not everyone.

01:37:55.684 --> 01:37:58.778
We lost a couple of good, little men
out there tonight.

01:37:59.188 --> 01:38:03.056
With great victory comes great sacrifice.

01:38:04.059 --> 01:38:05.583
Yeah.

01:38:08.564 --> 01:38:10.395
Dad, look.

01:38:16.238 --> 01:38:18.172
Bully!

01:38:39.061 --> 01:38:41.427
You ain't getting rid of us that easy.

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:03.445
Until tomorrow evening, Lawrence?

01:39:04.086 --> 01:39:06.384
Yeah. I don't know about that, Teddy.

01:39:07.122 --> 01:39:09.386
It's gonna be tough
to talk my way out of this one.

01:39:09.558 --> 01:39:11.617
Well, if that's indeed the case...

01:39:11.794 --> 01:39:13.694
...then it's farewell, my friend.

01:39:15.664 --> 01:39:17.325
Nick?

01:39:18.467 --> 01:39:20.367
Your father's a great man.

01:39:20.869 --> 01:39:22.461
I know.

01:39:28.277 --> 01:39:29.904
Told you.

01:39:33.382 --> 01:39:35.350
All right. Good night.

01:39:35.517 --> 01:39:38.418
No, Lawrence. Good day.

01:39:43.492 --> 01:39:45.392
Hey, Teddy?

01:39:58.607 --> 01:40:00.199
Thanks.

01:40:13.856 --> 01:40:17.087
You're watching New York 1.
News all morning.

01:40:18.427 --> 01:40:20.952
Thanks for joining us.
There is a fresh blanket of snow.

01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:23.530
But it's not the snow
that's got New Yorkers talking.

01:40:23.699 --> 01:40:27.931
It's what's in the snow. There are
dinosaur tracks along West 81st Street.

01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:31.903
Here's the remarkable video. These appear
to be Tyrannosaurus Rex tracks...

01:40:32.074 --> 01:40:35.134
...and they lead straight
to the Museum of Natural History.

01:40:35.611 --> 01:40:39.707
Authorities have found what appear to be
cave drawings in the subway.

01:40:39.882 --> 01:40:43.010
Neanderthals atop the museum roof.
Elaborate hoax or publicity stunt?

01:40:44.586 --> 01:40:46.451
You be the judge,
but one thing's for sure:

01:40:46.622 --> 01:40:50.251
The folks at the Natural History Museum
have really outdone them--

01:40:53.529 --> 01:40:54.791
Any explanation at all?

01:40:59.101 --> 01:41:00.762
No. Got nothing.

01:41:00.936 --> 01:41:02.164
Good.

01:41:02.771 --> 01:41:05.433
I'll take your keys and your flashlight.

01:41:23.458 --> 01:41:25.551
Folks, this way.

01:42:23.218 --> 01:42:27.211
My name is Nick Daley.
My Career Day parent is my dad.

01:42:27.389 --> 01:42:30.517
He's the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

01:42:35.564 --> 01:42:37.464
Hey, how's it going? Well, Nicky said it:

01:42:37.633 --> 01:42:40.101
I'm the night watchman
at the Museum of Natural History.

01:42:40.269 --> 01:42:44.228
Let me tell you something:
That's when history comes alive.

01:42:45.507 --> 01:42:48.101
How many of you guys
have been over to the museum?

01:43:09.031 --> 01:43:12.398
Goal!

01:43:39.328 --> 01:43:41.762
Hey, it's getting late.
Are you ready to go home?

01:43:42.297 --> 01:43:43.286
Nope.

01:43:49.805 --> 01:43:51.432
Let's ride.

01:44:28.977 --> 01:44:32.242
It was nice of Larry not to rat us out,
but this is ridiculous.

01:44:32.414 --> 01:44:35.440
We're night watchmen, not janitors!

01:44:35.617 --> 01:44:37.414
Gentlemen, you're doing a terrific job.

01:44:37.586 --> 01:44:39.053
I'll gonna catch a few Z's.

01:44:39.221 --> 01:44:40.688
You ain't going nowhere.

01:44:40.856 --> 01:44:43.518
Start mopping, hot dog.

01:44:47.963 --> 01:44:49.624
Over here.
