00:47.798 --> 00:49.507
Hold the doors, please!

00:51.009 --> 00:52.927
Thank you . Good morning .

00:53.011 --> 00:54.762
Good morning .

00:54.847 --> 00:56.472
Draper has you in early, huh?

00:56.557 --> 00:58.558
- What's he up to?
- I don't know.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.310
I kind of came in for myself.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.770
Okay.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.105
Honestly, I couldn't sleep.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.107
I'm just filled with nerves.

01:06.191 --> 01:07.942
The service elevator is out.

01:08.026 --> 01:09.235
Do you mind?

01:17.035 --> 01:18.619
I'm moving today.

01:18.704 --> 01:22.790
I'm supposed to go by at lunch
and supervise the movers.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.877
Probably lose the rest of the day
watching other people work.

01:25.961 --> 01:28.337
Well, that is a big day.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.256
What do you have
to be nervous about?

01:30.340 --> 01:31.674
Nothing .

01:31.759 --> 01:35.470
Just I think Mr, Rumsen is presenting
my copy today to the Belle Jolie people.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.513
A thing like that.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.729
We really took the local , didn't we?

01:44.813 --> 01:46.564
It's 7 in the morning .

01:46.648 --> 01:48.941
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:49.026 --> 01:50.401
Here we are.

02:04.249 --> 02:05.750
I'm going to hop down for a coffee.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.960
- Would you like some?
- No.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.420
Are you sure?

02:09.505 --> 02:12.089
Come in here, please.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.016
Close the door.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.560
There's no one here.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.104
Close the door.

02:39.409 --> 02:43.996
Peggy. . .do you know how hard it is

02:44.081 --> 02:46.833
to see you walking
around here every day?

03:27.165 --> 03:29.083
Your skirt. It's tight.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.543
Just pull it up.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.758
Be careful.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.326
Listen ,

04:03.410 --> 04:05.286
maybe this isn't
the right time to mention this,

04:05.370 --> 04:07.955
but I want to clear the air.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.125
I know I told you I would read
the copy that you wrote,

04:11.209 --> 04:14.211
but. . . I haven't.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.381
I'm glad .

04:17.466 --> 04:20.176
I thought you just didn't like it.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.641
That's too bad .

04:26.725 --> 04:29.018
Peggy.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.438
I know what you're going to say.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.398
No.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.150
You don't.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.444
You haven't been right once.

04:47.371 --> 04:51.207
I have all these things going on
in my head , and I can't say them .

04:52.793 --> 04:55.002
Do you think about me?

04:57.756 --> 04:59.423
I'll be honest.

05:01.051 --> 05:03.636
A few times.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.263
You're only 20 yards away.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.265
Not right now.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.189
I wake up in the morning
and I look into Trudy's eyes,

05:15.273 --> 05:19.694
and I think, "We're supposed
to be one person."

05:23.115 --> 05:25.658
But whatever I try. . .

05:25.742 --> 05:28.452
I have all these things
going on in my head .

05:30.747 --> 05:33.708
She's just another stranger.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.090
Pete.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.635
You're not alone in this.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.234
I'm sorry I ripped your blouse.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.945
It's okay.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.127
Morning . Sterling Cooper. Please hold .

06:18.211 --> 06:20.129
Look who's off the clock again .

06:28.055 --> 06:30.347
He's speaking Italian to his mother.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.190
Ciao, ciao.

06:39.274 --> 06:40.649
My stars.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.360
Two weeks in , and she's already a goner.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.446
He talks to his mother a lot.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.114
Mr. Crane? I'll connect you .

06:47.199 --> 06:49.283
Because he's not married .

06:49.367 --> 06:50.576
Well, he's in the Art Department?

06:50.660 --> 06:52.161
What does he look like?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.288
Did you see that movie Marty
with Ernest Borgnine?

06:54.372 --> 06:55.706
He lived with his mother.

06:55.791 --> 06:57.291
Stop teasing her.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.667
Yes, right away.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.294
My guess is tall, dark, and handsome,

07:00.378 --> 07:03.005
but I'm a glass-half-full kind of gal.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.299
She is so thoughtful.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.093
- Let me get my purse.
- Forget it.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.262
Mrs, Sterling will be calling
before lunchtime today.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.514
Please put her through directly to me.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.849
- Done.
- Ask her. She'll know.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.561
Salvatore Romano in the Art Department.

07:17.646 --> 07:18.771
Do you know him?

07:18.855 --> 07:22.316
Handsome. Very debonair.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.318
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.028
Something European , maybe.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.446
You're so specific.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.783
You have voices. I have other things.

07:31.868 --> 07:32.993
Thank you so much for holding .

07:35.330 --> 07:37.790
Good morning .

07:37.874 --> 07:40.334
Mr, Cooper wanted
to see you in his office.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.044
Tell M r. Sterling I'll be right there.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.712
No, it's just M r. Cooper.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.300
Thank you , Peggy.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.510
What happened there?

07:49.594 --> 07:51.470
I caught it on something .

07:51.555 --> 07:53.556
I might start keeping a spare.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.487
Come on in.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.789
I'd prefer you didn't
smoke in here right now.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.794
Don , I am appreciative of your talents,

08:23.879 --> 08:26.797
and although that cannot be measured ,

08:26.882 --> 08:30.885
I have made an effort to quantify.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.397
$2,500.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.690
I--

08:44.774 --> 08:47.484
Thank you . That's what you say.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.366
Have you read her?

08:54.451 --> 08:55.534
Rand .

08:55.619 --> 08:58.537
Atlas Shrugged.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.831
That's the one.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.250
Yes. Yes, it is.

09:03.335 --> 09:06.337
See, I know you haven't read it.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.421
When you hit 40,

09:07.505 --> 09:13.510
you realize you've met or seen
every kind of person there is,

09:13.595 --> 09:16.347
and I know what kind you are.

09:17.515 --> 09:22.061
Because I believe we are alike.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.438
I assume that's flattering .

09:24.522 --> 09:28.442
By that I mean you are a productive
and reasonable man ,

09:28.526 --> 09:32.446
and in the end completely self-interested .

09:32.530 --> 09:34.448
It's strength .

09:34.532 --> 09:36.367
We are different--

09:36.451 --> 09:38.744
unsentimental about all the people

09:38.828 --> 09:42.498
who depend on our hard work.

09:42.582 --> 09:50.547
Take $ 1 .99 out of that $2,500
and buy yourself a copy.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.095
I will.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.190
Well, hello, there.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.109
Hello.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.653
Are you Traffic, or are you here for casting?

10:12.737 --> 10:14.405
I'm-- I'm not a model .

10:14.489 --> 10:15.447
I'm new.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.490
Excuse me, Marty,

10:16.574 --> 10:19.076
who's doing the Firestone comps,
you or Frank?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.537
Neither of us. Sal.
We were talking to Miss. . .

10:21.621 --> 10:23.956
Lois. Lois Sadler.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.166
I'm new here. Switchboard .

10:26.251 --> 10:27.584
Marty Faraday.

10:28.670 --> 10:29.920
Why would they hide you?

10:30.005 --> 10:32.673
Hi, Lois. Duane Davis.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.717
Salvatore Romano.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.510
Sorry about the mess.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.720
Oh, no, it's divine.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.430
I work in a closet all day,

10:39.514 --> 10:41.515
so just to come out
and walk around is wonderful.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.018
Is there anything I can do for you?

10:44.102 --> 10:45.894
I'm such a featherhead .

10:45.979 --> 10:48.814
I need to get my paperwork
in to Accounting,

10:48.898 --> 10:50.774
then find my way back
to the switchboard room .

10:50.859 --> 10:52.484
Am I close?

10:52.569 --> 10:55.612
No. You're not even on the right floor.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.947
I'll walk you there.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.532
No. Just point me there. I'm fine.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.992
Go upstairs,

11:00.076 --> 11:01.535
make a left outside of the stairwell ,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.829
follow the wall past the ladies' room .

11:05.623 --> 11:07.624
Well , nice to meet you .

11:12.213 --> 11:13.922
Ciao, ciao.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.053
That ate up some time.

11:19.137 --> 11:20.721
I like when they flirt with me.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.681
She was flirting with him .

11:22.766 --> 11:26.560
You know, I had the salesman
pushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.730
I'd have bought it right away
if I knew it worked .

11:29.814 --> 11:32.441
It's not the ties.
They always talk to you .

11:32.525 --> 11:34.234
They can tell you make money.

11:34.319 --> 11:39.198
I told you , you don't need money
to dress better than you do, Duane.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.661
Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.375
What line?

11:49.459 --> 11:51.627
Light up a line, will you?

11:51.711 --> 11:54.338
No, she's right here, in person .

11:57.842 --> 11:59.676
Send her in .

12:01.930 --> 12:02.888
Hello, my love.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.890
Hello, homeowner.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.225
What are you doing here, lovely?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.227
I thought I'd come get you
and we could go together.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.561
We could even walk.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.729
It's 30 blocks.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.689
It's beautiful outside.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.446
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.867
Well , then let's do this here.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.541
I said I'd meet you there
if my schedule allowed ,

12:30.625 --> 12:33.210
and now it doesn't look so good .

12:33.294 --> 12:35.587
No, you didn't, and I'm here now.

12:35.672 --> 12:36.630
What does it matter?

12:36.714 --> 12:38.549
This is my office.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.553
How do you think it looks?

12:42.637 --> 12:46.098
Like you are beloved by your wife.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.479
You see what happens
when you just show up like this?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.106
We fight.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.483
I came here to celebrate
us having our apartment,

12:56.568 --> 12:59.445
which I for one am happy about.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.071
And you have ruined it.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.574
I'm sorry.

13:03.658 --> 13:07.161
I'm just busier than I thought.

13:07.245 --> 13:09.663
Let's have a glass of champagne.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.960
I'm sorry.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.588
We're going to live there a long time.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.632
There's no point in being superstitious.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.803
It's as simple as E pluribus unum:

13:24.888 --> 13:26.680
"From many, one."

13:26.764 --> 13:30.851
From many shades of lipstick,
one that belongs to her.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.688
From a basket of kisses,
she picks one.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.858
It makes her unique. It colors her kiss.

13:37.942 --> 13:41.695
And her kiss, well, it colors her man .

13:41.779 --> 13:46.283
"Belle Jolie Lipstick. Mark Your Man ."

13:46.367 --> 13:48.702
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.

13:48.786 --> 13:53.665
Women want colors,
lots and lots of colors.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.334
"Mark Your Man ."

13:55.418 --> 13:56.710
It's pretty cute.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.629
Oh, you like this?

13:58.713 --> 14:02.466
Well, maybe we should cut
down to five shades or one.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.969
I'm not telling you to listen to anyone,
but this is a very fresh approach .

14:06.054 --> 14:07.346
It's okay, Kenny.

14:07.430 --> 14:11.475
I don't think there's much else
to do here but call it a day.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.101
Gentlemen , thank you for your time.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.312
Is that all?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.649
You're a nonbeliever.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.734
Why should we waste time on Kabuki?

14:20.818 --> 14:23.445
I don't know what that means.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.364
It means that you've
already tried your plan ,

14:25.448 --> 14:27.574
and you're number 4.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.409
You've enlisted my expertise,

14:29.494 --> 14:31.828
and you've rejected it to go on
the way you've been going .

14:31.913 --> 14:34.790
I'm not interested in that.
You can understand .

14:34.874 --> 14:38.210
I don't think your three months
or however many thousands of dollars

14:38.294 --> 14:41.713
entitles you to refocus
the core of our business.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.882
Listen , I'm not here to tell you about Jesus.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.300
You already know about Jesus.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.345
Either He lives in your heart
or He doesn't.

14:48.429 --> 14:52.224
Every woman wants choices,

14:52.308 --> 14:56.562
but in the end, none wants to be one
of a hundred in a box.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.146
She's unique.

14:58.231 --> 15:01.775
She makes the choices,
and she's chosen him .

15:01.859 --> 15:04.778
She wants to tell the world , "He's mine.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.780
He belongs to me, not you ."

15:06.864 --> 15:10.450
She marks her man with her lips.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.994
He is her possession .

15:12.078 --> 15:14.955
You've given every girl
that wears your lipstick

15:15.039 --> 15:17.874
the gift of total ownership.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.382
Sit down .

15:25.466 --> 15:27.843
No.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.470
Not until I know I'm not wasting my time.

15:30.555 --> 15:32.889
Sit down .

15:34.892 --> 15:37.644
Do you know how to get
back to the Roosevelt?

15:37.729 --> 15:41.690
We could have someone walk you over,
or just meet you , if you're interested .

15:41.774 --> 15:43.483
You're a troublemaker.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.819
Although, it is a place to get into trouble.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.571
They just did this incredible renovation .

15:47.655 --> 15:50.282
It reminds me a little of a steamship.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.617
And the people--

15:51.701 --> 15:52.993
I was in the lounge last night,

15:53.077 --> 15:55.621
and I end up having a drink
with Robert Mitchum .

15:56.789 --> 15:58.290
Actually, many drinks.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.417
Now, you know we wouldn't
steer you wrong .

16:01.919 --> 16:04.463
N ice work.
I think you may be right about this.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.298
Well, we'll never know, will we?

16:06.382 --> 16:07.841
What?

16:07.925 --> 16:09.092
It's not a science, Hugh .

16:09.177 --> 16:10.677
We'll do our best.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.391
That Jesus thing .

16:16.476 --> 16:18.727
I don't know what to say.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.855
Probably better than dangling him
out the window by his ankles.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.440
That's just a story.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.983
Don's never actually done that.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.902
Ken, you will realize in your private life

16:26.986 --> 16:30.864
that at a certain point seduction is over
and force is actually being requested .

16:30.948 --> 16:32.074
Ah , he's a kid .

16:32.158 --> 16:33.950
He thinks it's the other way around .

16:45.296 --> 16:48.215
Peggy, ice! We'll need some.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.221
Should I just put it down?

16:59.977 --> 17:01.311
How much ice?

17:01.396 --> 17:02.979
How do you take it?

17:04.107 --> 17:05.691
Home run , ballerina.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.778
Go ahead , before
Joan Holloway sees.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.367
You call that celebrating?

17:21.416 --> 17:23.917
The meeting was so long , I was worried .

17:24.001 --> 17:25.961
We barely finished the presentation ,
and he bought it.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.130
No, he's being modest.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.006
Donald walked around
the village three times

17:30.091 --> 17:31.883
and then set it on fire.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.678
Oh , my God . Can I see it?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.308
It's marvelous.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.643
I thought it was going to say

17:41.728 --> 17:43.520
"It's the mark
you make on your man ."

17:43.604 --> 17:45.397
Was it, now?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.232
You may be a writer, honey.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.567
Really?

17:48.651 --> 17:50.360
You're arrogant.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.363
You want another drink?

17:53.448 --> 17:54.740
I don't know.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.032
- Not a writer,
- Not a writer.

17:59.036 --> 18:00.704
Can I keep it?

18:00.788 --> 18:02.038
No.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.630
What are you doing?

18:10.715 --> 18:12.340
Don't ever put your name on a list.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.384
They keep track of everything we do here.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.428
Have you never heard
of Joseph McCarthy?

18:16.512 --> 18:18.138
It's the bowling team .

18:18.222 --> 18:19.973
Oh , my God . It happened .

18:20.057 --> 18:21.641
- They loved it.
- What are you talking about?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.101
I'm heading out. Don't look for me.

18:23.186 --> 18:24.978
I have errands to run .

18:25.062 --> 18:26.897
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.

18:26.981 --> 18:27.939
Congratulations!

18:28.024 --> 18:28.982
That's so fascinating!

18:29.066 --> 18:31.485
I'm glad your other work
was suffering for a reason .

18:31.569 --> 18:32.986
They poured me a drink.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.654
- Who?
- Mr. Draper.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.990
M r. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and--

18:37.074 --> 18:38.074
Oh , I'm so jealous.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.285
Don't be. I was just--
I shouldn't be bragging.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.912
They sold Peggy's copy.

18:41.996 --> 18:42.996
My word .

18:43.080 --> 18:44.247
Actually, they changed it a little bit,

18:44.332 --> 18:45.290
but it worked .

18:45.374 --> 18:47.083
- Oh, we're celebrating.
- How about it?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.836
Five minutes to 5,
we head to P.J . Clarke's.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.087
Perfect!

19:00.890 --> 19:03.058
It's going to be a hell of an afternoon
traffic meeting .

19:03.142 --> 19:04.601
Oh, champagne.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.019
When did that happen?

19:06.103 --> 19:08.146
Another grateful client stopped by.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.231
I thought you were moving today.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.858
I was looking forward to seeing you
in a pair of coveralls.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.027
Yes, well, I managed to explain
to the concerned party

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
that I already have a job.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.156
Do they ever stop asking for things?

19:23.329 --> 19:26.039
Hello.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.959
Hildy, um , she must have
gone to lunch already.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.335
Congratulations.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.046
Yes. I hear you're quite the little scribe.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.130
You can trust Ken's opinion here.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.465
He's a published author, you know.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.050
But he can't write copy.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.553
I don't like to limit my words that much .

19:39.637 --> 19:41.304
I also hate puns.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.514
Come on .

19:42.598 --> 19:45.892
"Admiral : the television
that won't go down the tubes."

19:47.144 --> 19:48.144
Shut up.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.064
So you going to celebrate?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.148
Well, yes, actually.

19:52.233 --> 19:56.069
A bunch of us-- just the girls so far--
are going to P. J . Clarke's tonight.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.238
Forget tonight. I heard Cooper, Sterling,
and Draper already left.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.281
Am I wrong?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.074
What about M r. Rumsen?

20:01.158 --> 20:03.201
Freddie Rumsen's at P.J .'s right now,

20:03.286 --> 20:04.578
and he doesn't know there's a party.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.163
3:00, after the traffic meeting .

20:07.248 --> 20:08.456
Joan's a tattletale.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.084
I don't know, Peggy.

20:11.168 --> 20:14.129
I'm kind of senior ranking
when those other men are gone.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.173
Speaker of the House.
He'll be there.

20:18.843 --> 20:23.471
I should probably go home, actually.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.682
Well, if we're starting at 3,
you can go home at 5.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.517
It'll still be after work.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.768
We all work so hard ,

20:28.853 --> 20:30.186
I think we all need it.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.192
Why not?

20:37.695 --> 20:38.778
Toodle-oo.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.001
Hello.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.629
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch,

20:55.713 --> 20:57.505
but I have a phone call for you .

20:57.590 --> 20:59.799
Well, I'm glad I stayed in.

21:02.929 --> 21:05.221
Oh, it's disconnected .

21:07.099 --> 21:09.267
Everybody's talking about the meeting.

21:09.352 --> 21:12.729
M iss Olsen said your artwork
was spectacular.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.230
She did , did she?

21:14.315 --> 21:15.607
Anyway, a bunch of us

21:15.691 --> 21:17.108
are taking her out to drinks.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.151
P.J . Clarke's?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.195
She deserves it.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.489
You have to come.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.950
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.618
I know that.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.621
I'll be there.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.498
Good .

21:44.387 --> 21:45.428
Can I help you?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.891
Can I help you , sir?

21:49.976 --> 21:53.853
It's Don . The ad man .

21:53.938 --> 21:55.230
He's okay.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.565
Excuse me, fellas.

22:03.406 --> 22:07.200
Oh , just because I can't call you
doesn't mean you can't call me.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.284
Hello.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.585
Pack a bag . We're going to Paris.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.921
- What?
- Paris.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.006
Now?

22:24.385 --> 22:25.844
Where'd you get that?

22:25.928 --> 22:27.929
It's a bonus.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.222
I'm not sure what for.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.224
I bet.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.226
What do you say?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.395
I called Idyllwild .

22:35.479 --> 22:37.897
We can have breakfast at Versailles.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.568
I'm sorry.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.237
I have a special night planned .

22:47.074 --> 22:49.242
I thought you didn't make plans.

22:49.326 --> 22:50.702
Is he joining us?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.662
Yes. He has to.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.956
He looks kind of square.

22:55.041 --> 22:58.501
Kibby just came four days straight
from Juarez.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.253
May I?

23:00.337 --> 23:02.547
I've been thinking about this
since Port Authority.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.260
Stay. You'll love it.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.764
We're going to get high and listen to M iles.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.974
That's your plan?

23:13.059 --> 23:16.311
We can do this first and then do that.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.605
It'll be a lot more fun .

23:18.689 --> 23:22.650
Sit down . Relax.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.652
Next to me, Icky.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.740
Where did you find him?

23:28.824 --> 23:31.993
You know you need to leave the Village
for a decent screw.

23:33.788 --> 23:36.915
I'll take care of him .

23:46.842 --> 23:49.385
Do you like it?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.770
I feel like Dorothy.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.147
Everything just turned to color.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.316
The words.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.528
You are good with the words, man .

24:07.696 --> 24:09.697
Well put.

24:09.824 --> 24:16.538
Kibby, why don't you make yourself useful
and get me a glass of water?

24:21.585 --> 24:24.587
My word , I need to get one of those.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.427
No, thanks.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.473
Okay.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.100
Maybe.

24:39.270 --> 24:42.689
We realize there's no music playing .

24:42.773 --> 24:43.815
Just the--

25:24.398 --> 25:25.899
Good afternoon , ma'am .

25:25.983 --> 25:29.402
I'm embarrassed to ask,
seeing as we all have it hard right now,

25:29.486 --> 25:32.071
but is there any way
I can trouble you for a meal?

25:32.156 --> 25:33.406
I'm willing to work for it.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.824
Look around you .

25:34.909 --> 25:36.409
We're not Christians here no more.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.954
That is not true.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.831
Fine, fine.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.458
Work will feed your soul ,

25:43.542 --> 25:45.793
but there's no work left here today.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.545
Come back tomorrow?

25:52.384 --> 25:53.593
Nonsense.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.595
You'll stay with us and eat with us,

25:55.679 --> 25:58.264
and work tomorrow.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.141
I will have to boil those clothes, though,

26:00.226 --> 26:01.976
if you're going to sit at my table.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.102
I'm not offended .

26:03.187 --> 26:05.730
It would be a relief to me as well .

26:05.814 --> 26:10.652
Dick Whitman, stop digging holes.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.112
Build a fire under the cauldron.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.530
Hiya, kid .

26:17.952 --> 26:20.703
What did I say to you?

26:20.788 --> 26:22.705
Reminds me of myself.

26:22.790 --> 26:26.125
That doesn't surprise me at all.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.462
So we thank You , Lord ,

26:29.546 --> 26:31.464
for this bounty we are about to receive

26:31.548 --> 26:33.758
that we may share it with those in need .

26:33.842 --> 26:35.176
Amen .

26:38.347 --> 26:41.182
Thank you again ,
Thank you so much .

26:41.267 --> 26:42.475
This smells delicious.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.477
Where are those manners from?

26:44.561 --> 26:47.689
Let him eat and be on with it.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.357
I'm from just east.

26:49.441 --> 26:52.485
About New York, originally,
some other places.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.654
Ah . New York.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.490
It's how you took to being
on the bum so easy.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.659
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.

27:00.953 --> 27:04.497
I'm just saying I bet he don't know
which end of a weed to pull .

27:04.581 --> 27:07.166
That's the truth, sir.
I only know some farm work,

27:07.251 --> 27:09.502
but I've seen mills and docks and factories.

27:09.586 --> 27:11.170
I've been a worker.

27:11.255 --> 27:12.880
Are you a communist?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.424
No.

27:14.508 --> 27:17.677
Yeah, I imagine they're different, all right.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.513
They take a club to the jaw
like anyone else.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.599
They are souls,
but they can't be saved .

27:24.893 --> 27:26.519
That's true.

27:26.603 --> 27:29.605
My mom always said
that life is like a horseshoe.

27:30.733 --> 27:34.944
It's fat in the middle,
open on both ends,

27:35.029 --> 27:36.612
and hard all the way through .

27:51.712 --> 27:52.879
Tomorrow. . .

27:54.131 --> 27:55.840
when you've finished some work.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.595
Bless you .

28:19.656 --> 28:21.115
I had to see this place for myself.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.158
Good .

28:22.242 --> 28:23.910
It's something , huh?

28:23.994 --> 28:25.620
No Bob Mitchum?

28:25.704 --> 28:26.913
What are you drinking?

28:26.997 --> 28:28.915
Campari with a twist.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.584
You know, when I mentioned
the renovation ,

28:31.668 --> 28:33.586
I didn't know if you heard me.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.172
I've been curious about seeing this place.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.175
I'm actually involved with architects
on this department store.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.843
Signage, mostly.

28:40.928 --> 28:45.056
I like this room,
although I am its prime target:

28:45.140 --> 28:46.474
traveling salesman .

28:46.558 --> 28:49.685
In that suit? I should say not.

28:49.770 --> 28:53.564
No, I'm not one of those boys
who looks forward to a business trip

28:53.649 --> 28:55.108
to escape the wife and kids.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.693
I'm really a homebody.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.070
But New York?

28:59.154 --> 29:00.363
When you arrive,

29:00.447 --> 29:02.073
and that train starts slowing down

29:02.157 --> 29:03.616
and it gets all dark,

29:03.700 --> 29:05.993
my heart pounds, and I think,

29:06.078 --> 29:09.747
"I'm going to climb that staircase
and be in New York."

29:09.832 --> 29:12.208
I take it for granted .

29:12.292 --> 29:14.627
It is a masterpiece of some kind .

29:14.711 --> 29:17.755
Wherever I'm staying,
I always demand a view.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.841
It's building after building .

29:19.925 --> 29:22.760
Little compartments
filled with possibilities.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.554
What's that from?

29:24.638 --> 29:26.013
42nd Street?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.557
What?

29:27.641 --> 29:28.641
Uh , no.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.810
No. I'm just saying it's--

29:30.894 --> 29:33.229
it's like you can do anything .

29:35.732 --> 29:36.858
I'm two ahead of you .

29:36.942 --> 29:38.234
I have to eat something,

29:38.318 --> 29:40.486
or I'm going to continue to rhapsodize.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.739
What time is it?

29:44.950 --> 29:48.453
I bet you don't have an expense account.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.689
I'm not saying Peggy
doesn't have something upstairs.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.149
I'm just saying at Sterling Cooper

30:18.233 --> 30:19.525
things are usually happening downstairs.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.236
I didn't know that.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.822
My God , the whole office is here.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.325
I don't see the Art Department.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.494
What about those two?

30:33.165 --> 30:37.001
U h , I think I had too much to drink.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.754
You are very petite.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.539
Going back to the well . Interested?

32:09.469 --> 32:10.428
Dance with me.

32:14.057 --> 32:16.892
I don't like you like this.

33:10.197 --> 33:13.866
Literally, "With flies."

33:13.950 --> 33:16.285
The espresso beans mean health, wealth ,

33:16.370 --> 33:18.704
and, um , happiness.

33:18.789 --> 33:19.872
Seems redundant,

33:19.956 --> 33:22.249
I mean, if you already
have health and wealth .

33:22.334 --> 33:23.959
So, are you happy?

33:25.379 --> 33:26.796
I'm one of those people

33:26.880 --> 33:29.423
who thinks the minute you ask
that, you're not happy, so. . .

33:30.842 --> 33:32.802
no.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.888
You're loud , but you're shy.

33:35.972 --> 33:38.599
I feel like I'm getting my fortune told .

33:38.684 --> 33:39.725
I'm sorry.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.019
Ah , it's fine.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.107
So what do you want to do?

33:46.191 --> 33:48.901
Uh . . . I don't know.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.612
Maybe break off with one of the writers,

33:51.697 --> 33:53.406
have my own little shop

33:53.490 --> 33:57.368
where copy follows art
and not the other way around .

33:57.452 --> 33:59.245
No, I mean my view.

33:59.329 --> 34:00.871
You have to see it.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.915
It's all the way to the park.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.000
Of course it's dark now.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.963
I don't know.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.551
May I?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.149
I . . .

34:28.233 --> 34:29.942
don't know what to say.

34:30.026 --> 34:31.944
It's Elliot.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.905
And, Salvatore, you don't
have to say anything .

34:34.990 --> 34:36.240
No, I-- I just--

34:38.452 --> 34:39.952
No.

34:40.036 --> 34:44.039
Have another drink. Think about it.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.210
Elliot,

34:48.295 --> 34:50.963
I have thought about it.

34:51.047 --> 34:55.092
I know what I want.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.553
I know what I want to do.

34:58.847 --> 35:02.892
I know what you're thinking .

35:02.976 --> 35:05.269
I'll show you .

35:12.694 --> 35:15.112
What are you afraid of?

35:16.656 --> 35:18.365
Are you joking?

35:24.873 --> 35:28.083
This. . .has been a pleasure.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.938
Don , are you all right?

35:49.022 --> 35:50.981
I don't know.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.531
It's always the same thing !

35:58.615 --> 36:01.826
It's probably the guy in 2F.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.286
He uses his wife like a speed bag .

36:04.371 --> 36:05.955
Oh , man.

36:06.039 --> 36:08.666
I was going to truck down
for some carrot juice.

36:14.756 --> 36:15.840
Wait, wait.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.863
Thank you .

36:38.947 --> 36:39.905
Smoke?

36:39.990 --> 36:40.948
No.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.159
He speaks.

36:44.244 --> 36:47.329
I'm supposed to tell you
to say your prayers.

36:47.414 --> 36:50.082
Praying won't help you from this place, kid .

36:50.166 --> 36:52.084
Best keep your mind on your mother.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.878
She'll probably look after you .

36:53.962 --> 36:56.088
She ain't my momma.

36:56.172 --> 36:59.633
We all wish we were
from someplace else, believe me.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.677
Ain't you heard?

37:01.761 --> 37:04.346
I'm a whore child .

37:04.431 --> 37:09.101
No. I hadn't heard
anything about that.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.104
You don't talk like a bum .

37:12.188 --> 37:15.107
I'm not. I'm a gentleman of the rails.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.693
For me, every day is brand-new.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.321
Every day's a brand-new place,

37:20.405 --> 37:23.115
people, what have you .

37:23.199 --> 37:26.869
So you got no home.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.370
That's sad .

37:28.455 --> 37:29.914
What's at home?

37:29.998 --> 37:31.790
I had a family once:

37:31.875 --> 37:34.835
a wife, a job, a mortgage.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.130
I couldn't sleep at night
tied to all those things.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.424
Then death came to find me.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.177
Did you see him?

37:43.261 --> 37:45.179
Only every night.

37:45.263 --> 37:49.141
So one morning , I freed myself
with the clothes on my back.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.143
Good-bye.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.145
Now I sleep like a stone:

37:53.229 --> 37:56.148
sometimes under the stars, the rain .

37:56.232 --> 37:57.858
the roof of a barn .

37:57.943 --> 37:59.526
But I sleep like a stone.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.154
So where do you go?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.948
Tomorrow I'll be leaving this place,

38:04.032 --> 38:05.532
that's for certain .

38:05.617 --> 38:08.160
If death was coming
anyplace, it's here, kid ,

38:08.244 --> 38:09.787
creeping around every corner.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.791
Here.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.169
You're an honorary.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.172
This is how we talk to each other.

38:20.256 --> 38:24.009
On the front gate of every house,
there's a mark.

38:24.094 --> 38:27.179
It's a code, just like
you heard on the radio.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.263
See. . .

38:31.226 --> 38:32.184
That's a pie.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.103
It means the food here is good .

38:34.187 --> 38:35.187
This one. . .

38:36.731 --> 38:39.817
That means watch out
for the nasty dog .

38:39.901 --> 38:41.110
This one here. . .

38:42.445 --> 38:45.781
That means a dishonest man lives here.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.908
And this one. . .

38:52.914 --> 38:56.000
That means tell a sad story.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.292
Here.

38:59.295 --> 39:01.672
Don't be scared , kid .

39:01.756 --> 39:04.008
You ain't a man yet.

39:33.496 --> 39:34.913
Of course.

39:34.998 --> 39:37.249
What?

39:37.333 --> 39:39.585
You two.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.795
You're in love.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.006
What?

39:44.090 --> 39:46.675
That's ridiculous.

39:47.802 --> 39:52.264
Every day I make pictures
where people appear to be in love.

39:52.348 --> 39:54.349
I know what it looks like.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.272
Looks like a magazine.

40:00.356 --> 40:02.733
Love is bourgeois.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.278
You're breaking my heart.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.281
Dig . Ad man's got a heart.

40:09.365 --> 40:11.867
The grownups are talking.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.286
Don't defend him .

40:14.370 --> 40:17.247
Toothpaste doesn't solve anything .

40:17.332 --> 40:22.294
Dacron sure as hell won't bring back
those ten dead kids in Biloxi.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.463
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine

40:24.547 --> 40:26.673
and leaning up against a wall
in Grand Central

40:26.758 --> 40:28.175
pretending you're a vagrant.

40:28.259 --> 40:32.596
You know what it's like to watch
all you ants go into your hive?

40:34.140 --> 40:37.309
I wipe my ass with the Wall Street Journal.

40:37.393 --> 40:39.228
How come every time we have a party,

40:39.312 --> 40:41.897
the ladies have to sit
and listen to the men talk?

40:41.981 --> 40:42.940
Look at you--

40:43.024 --> 40:44.525
satisfied ,

40:44.609 --> 40:49.321
dreaming up jingles
for soap flakes and spot remover,

40:49.405 --> 40:51.156
telling yourself you're free.

40:51.241 --> 40:55.119
Oh, my God . Stop talking .

40:55.203 --> 40:56.495
Make something of yourself.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.540
Like you?

41:05.839 --> 41:07.589
You make the lie.

41:07.674 --> 41:12.344
You invent want.

41:12.428 --> 41:15.347
You're for them . . .

41:15.431 --> 41:17.724
not us.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.893
Well, I hate to break it to you ,

41:19.978 --> 41:22.479
but there is no big lie.

41:22.564 --> 41:25.107
There is no system .

41:25.191 --> 41:29.236
The universe is indifferent.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.867
Man , why'd you have to say that?

41:42.458 --> 41:43.584
Paris.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.295
Now. Let's go.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.130
Don.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.842
No, I can't.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.609
Buy yourself a car.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.114
Don.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.033
The cops.

42:16.117 --> 42:18.452
You can't go out there.

42:20.121 --> 42:21.496
You can't.

42:32.508 --> 42:33.842
Good evening .

43:06.960 --> 43:08.543
Wake up, Bobby.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.423
Come on, kiddo.

43:15.551 --> 43:16.551
Daddy.

43:18.179 --> 43:20.681
Your sister's sleeping .

43:23.226 --> 43:24.851
Ask me anything .

43:24.936 --> 43:26.478
What?

43:26.562 --> 43:27.854
Anything.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.565
I'm tired .

43:31.567 --> 43:34.486
Ask me.

43:34.570 --> 43:39.574
Uh , why do lightning bugs light up?

43:46.582 --> 43:48.250
I don't know.

43:51.587 --> 43:55.590
But I will never lie to you .

44:11.607 --> 44:14.526
Well, sir, I believe that does it.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.695
I'll be on my way.

44:16.779 --> 44:20.449
Thank you , again ,
for sharing your home.

44:22.035 --> 44:24.077
Good luck to you .

44:39.510 --> 44:41.428
Be on your way already.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.192
Good morning , Peggy.

47:00.276 --> 47:01.776
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
