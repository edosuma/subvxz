WEBVTT

00:09.313 --> 00:11.098
<i>In the criminal justice
system,</i>

00:11.141 --> 00:12.403
<i>the people are represented</i>

00:12.447 --> 00:14.797
<i>by two separate,
yet equally important groups:</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:16.755
<i>the police,
who investigate crime,</i>

00:16.799 --> 00:19.715
<i>and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:19.758 --> 00:21.717
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:23.197 --> 00:25.416
<i>I was there
when this girl died.</i>

00:25.460 --> 00:27.984
Sirenko put two in her chest
right in front of me.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.768
We were meeting
Sirenko's friend.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.944
-  <i>
- Ava had been reporting him.</i>

00:33.642 --> 00:36.601
The old guy starts screaming
she was gonna ruin everything.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.734
Anyone we find
in Sirenko's house

00:38.777 --> 00:40.475
<i>we cuff, along with him.</i>

00:40.518 --> 00:42.216
NYPD!

00:42.259 --> 00:44.087
That's all the makings
of a bomb.

00:44.131 --> 00:46.220
Where you going?
- Gonna find the bomb.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.874
What exactly did
the police say to you?

00:48.918 --> 00:51.268
Stay with me.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.096
Shut the city down now.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.271
I got eyes on the device.

00:54.315 --> 00:56.099
Evacuate.
Get out of there right now.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.582
You want the gun?

01:00.625 --> 01:02.279
I'll give you a chance
like you did my undercover.

01:06.414 --> 01:09.199
We have Sirenko on two counts
of murder, pandering,

01:09.243 --> 01:10.679
sex trafficking,
and, of course,

01:10.722 --> 01:12.376
the bombing
and terrorist charges.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.248
The evidence is strong?

01:14.291 --> 01:15.945
Yeah, we recovered
a handgun in his car

01:15.988 --> 01:17.512
that was used in both murders.

01:17.555 --> 01:20.036
As for the bombing, police
found chemicals and components

01:20.080 --> 01:22.691
in his home,
a schematic of the hotel,

01:22.734 --> 01:24.345
not to mention
he was apprehended

01:24.388 --> 01:25.694
at the site of the attack.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.565
OK, good.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.133
The two murders alone
should put him behind bars

01:30.177 --> 01:31.134
for the rest of his life.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.266
You mean five.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.832
What do you mean five?

01:33.876 --> 01:35.660
Police just found
three bodies in the hotel,

01:35.704 --> 01:37.836
or remnants of the
three bodies, anyway.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.404
They were employees--
two men, one woman.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.885
NYPD sent cadaver dogs
over there this morning.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.105
I thought the
building was evacuated.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.932
So did everyone else.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.543
It's awful.

01:48.586 --> 01:52.199
But the other
546 people survived.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.026
It could have been a lot worse.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.768
OK.

01:56.812 --> 01:59.336
Let's get to work.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.730
I still don't get it.

02:01.773 --> 02:04.254
Why would Sirenko want
to blow up a building

02:04.298 --> 02:06.822
filled with
NATO representatives?

02:06.865 --> 02:10.391
He's from Chechnya,
sympathetic to Russia,

02:10.434 --> 02:11.696
just looking to
make a statement.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.176
Well, that's my point.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.265
Since when did drug-dealing,
sex-trafficking gangsters

02:15.309 --> 02:17.224
make political statements,

02:17.267 --> 02:19.443
international political
statements, at that?

02:19.487 --> 02:22.359
Well, the evidence is strong.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.492
We know Sirenko
killed Ava and Vince,

02:24.535 --> 02:28.148
and we also know he built
and planted the bomb.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.279
But we don't know why?

02:29.323 --> 02:30.759
Does it matter?

02:30.802 --> 02:33.153
It could,
if we're missing something.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.423
The man that you and Ava
were with on the boat,

02:42.466 --> 02:43.772
the man Ava was recording,

02:43.815 --> 02:46.514
do you have any idea
what his name was?

02:46.557 --> 02:47.906
No.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.779
Do you happen to remember
what he looked like?

02:52.128 --> 02:55.000
Sort of, he was old.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.393
What about the way
he spoke,

02:56.437 --> 02:59.396
did he have any kind of accent?

02:59.440 --> 03:01.833
- Yeah.
- OK.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.879
Was that something
you'd ever heard before?

03:03.922 --> 03:09.841
It was Russian, I think,
or Chechnya like--

03:09.885 --> 03:10.842
like all the others.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.453
Good.

03:12.496 --> 03:15.238
Nicole, is there anything else
that you remember

03:15.282 --> 03:19.024
that you think
might be helpful?

03:19.068 --> 03:23.377
Well, he was very neat.

03:23.420 --> 03:26.336
He--he had, um,

03:26.380 --> 03:30.819
darkish, spiky hair.

03:30.862 --> 03:35.040
Anything else about
his appearance,

03:35.084 --> 03:39.393
his clothes, anything unusual?

03:39.436 --> 03:42.961
Well, he actually--
he--he did show us

03:43.005 --> 03:45.660
this like, metal thing,

03:45.703 --> 03:49.054
like he was from
the military or something.

03:49.098 --> 03:53.407
It was shaped like a star.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.061
That's really helpful, Nicole.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.715
Thank you.

04:01.110 --> 04:03.417
Four nights ago on the 5th.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.550
I have no idea--
cocktail party, reception,

04:06.594 --> 04:08.770
any kind of event where
there was a Russian or Chechen

04:08.813 --> 04:13.165
politician wearing
military garb?

04:13.209 --> 04:14.732
Yeah?

04:14.776 --> 04:15.907
OK.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.954
And you're sure
that was on the 5th?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.695
OK, great.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.436
Yes, yes,
the sooner the better.

04:22.479 --> 04:25.265
Thanks a lot.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.919
Hey, I just spoke with somebody
at the State Department.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.399
It turns out there
was a reception

04:29.443 --> 04:30.705
at the Russian Embassy
on the 5th,

04:30.748 --> 04:32.402
the night before
Ava was killed.

04:32.446 --> 04:34.404
Great.
Track down that guest list.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.319
It's on its way.

04:38.669 --> 04:40.367
What am I looking at here?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
Name's Daniel Rublev,

04:42.456 --> 04:45.633
"Senior Liaison
to the President of Russia."

04:45.676 --> 04:47.025
What the hell does that mean?

04:47.069 --> 04:49.593
It means he's friends
with Putin.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.596
State Department said
the same exact thing.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.469
He's the man Ava was recording
on that boat,

04:55.512 --> 04:57.819
same man who raped
and attacked Ava.

04:57.862 --> 05:01.257
So Rublev was on the boat
with the two young girls.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.173
What's that have to do with
Sirenko or the murder trial?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.957
I'm not sure yet.

05:06.001 --> 05:09.309
But Sirenko is a thug,
not a terrorist.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.049
He couldn't care less
about NATO.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.356
You think Rublev
was calling the shots?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.792
Yes.

05:14.836 --> 05:18.492
I think he ordered Sirenko
to blow up that hotel.

05:18.535 --> 05:21.364
And I also think he's sitting
in some lavish townhouse

05:21.408 --> 05:25.325
right now with his feet up
sipping some expensive whiskey,

05:25.368 --> 05:26.935
thinking he got away with it.

05:26.978 --> 05:30.547
Your disdain is well earned,
Nolan, but can we prove it?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.376
Well, like I said
on the phone,

05:33.420 --> 05:34.595
we're just looking
for some evidence

05:34.638 --> 05:36.597
that links Rublev to Sirenko.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.207
We got something.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.297
And you might be right, Rublev
seems to be the shot caller.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.908
Hey.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.084
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am

05:46.128 --> 05:49.174
to hear about your informant.

05:49.218 --> 05:51.176
Thanks.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.526
Pull up the Andre video.

05:52.569 --> 05:53.527
Who's Andre?

05:53.570 --> 05:54.963
Andre Lenkov.

05:55.006 --> 05:57.182
We IDed him as
Sirenko's lieutenant,

05:57.226 --> 05:59.489
and he's the idiot playing
video games on his phone

05:59.533 --> 06:00.969
right there.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.014
That's Sirenko and Rublev
behind Andre.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.016
They're at a social club
Sirenko owns.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.323
We put a wire in there
two months ago.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.803
It's on the other side
of the room,

06:08.846 --> 06:11.109
that's why we can't hear
anything that they're saying.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.416
But five minutes later,
Andre and Sirenko

06:13.460 --> 06:16.071
get close enough
that we get this.

06:16.114 --> 06:20.380
<i>This dude Rublev
scares me, bro.</i>

06:20.423 --> 06:22.382
<i>It is what it is.</i>

06:22.425 --> 06:23.687
<i>Yeah, I guess.</i>

06:23.731 --> 06:26.734
<i>It's just--you seen his eyes?</i>

06:26.777 --> 06:30.520
<i>Cold, it's like
he doesn't even see you.</i>

06:30.564 --> 06:33.871
<i>And the dude's best friend
is Putin.</i>

06:33.915 --> 06:37.397
<i>Man, I don't want to be
messing with any of this.</i>

06:37.440 --> 06:38.876
This is good.

06:38.920 --> 06:43.446
It proves Sirenko knows Rublev,
knows who he is,

06:43.490 --> 06:46.057
knows who his connections are.
- Yeah.

06:46.101 --> 06:49.278
It doesn't necessarily prove
that Rublev is the boss,

06:49.321 --> 06:52.324
or that he was connected
to any of these crimes.

06:52.368 --> 06:54.196
OK.
So we need more.

06:54.239 --> 06:57.112
We need Andre.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.550
- Andre.
- Who are you?

07:00.594 --> 07:03.727
Hey, we need to talk.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.209
Yeah, sure.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.298
But I've got to call my
lawyer first, you know,

07:09.341 --> 07:10.560
make an appointment.
- OK.

07:10.604 --> 07:11.996
Yeah, yeah, I could do that,
or I could just

07:12.040 --> 07:13.911
bust your dumb ass
right here right now

07:13.955 --> 07:16.131
in front of all your friends.

07:18.133 --> 07:21.528
What, are you going
to do something?

07:21.571 --> 07:23.443
You want to punch me?

07:25.662 --> 07:27.229
- Nah.
- Nah.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.709
It's not my style.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.754
It's not your style, right.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.277
You just like beating up
little girls, right,

07:32.321 --> 07:34.236
and then you pimp them out
to rich Russian pedophiles.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.499
Yeah?

07:36.543 --> 07:38.240
Tell you what,
you either go with us

07:38.283 --> 07:40.590
voluntarily right now--hey--

07:40.634 --> 07:42.766
or I go over
in front of your friends

07:42.810 --> 07:45.160
and I tell them I'm a cop,

07:45.203 --> 07:48.119
you and me are friends,
and you've been cooperating.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.078
Yeah, right?
- You trying to get me killed?

07:50.121 --> 07:51.427
You know, I'm just
telling you the way it is.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.733
Yo, guys--

07:52.776 --> 07:55.736
All right, all right,
let's take a ride.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.129
- Walk that way.
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.098
Let's start with Rublev.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.360
Is he your boss?

08:55.404 --> 08:57.624
Maybe, but I'm not sure.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.581
What?

08:58.625 --> 09:00.148
I report to Sirenko.

09:00.191 --> 09:03.586
I got no idea if he
answers to Rublev or not.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.632
OK.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.416
What about the yacht he rents?

09:07.459 --> 09:11.986
Were you on it the morning
Ava was murdered?

09:12.029 --> 09:13.465
OK.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.338
You have to talk for this
to be worth anything.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.950
Yes.
Yes, I was on the boat.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.386
Tell me what happened.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.518
Why did Ava run away?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.259
Why did Sirenko
chase and kill her?

09:24.302 --> 09:26.217
Rublev thought
she was recording him.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.959
I heard him yelling and
screaming, "Give me your phone."

09:29.003 --> 09:31.788
Next thing I know, I see
Ava running off the boat.

09:31.832 --> 09:33.834
Did Rublev tell Sirenko
to kill her?

09:33.877 --> 09:36.445
I don't know.

09:36.488 --> 09:39.448
What about the bombing?
Was that Rublev's idea?

09:39.491 --> 09:40.623
Did he tell Sirenko to do that?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.277
I don't know.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.672
Look, look, I wasn't in
the loop on any of that.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.761
I knew Sirenko was
working on something big.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.284
But I just try to
mind my own business.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.721
Hold on, people who
mind their own business

09:51.765 --> 09:53.593
don't get good deals,
they go to prison

09:53.636 --> 09:55.072
for a very long time.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.596
Now--
- I can't tell you something

09:56.639 --> 09:58.815
I don't know,
and I don't know.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.338
You're under arrest.

10:00.382 --> 10:02.079
Under arrest for what?

10:02.123 --> 10:03.994
Accessory to murder,
aiding and abetting

10:04.038 --> 10:05.692
an act of terror,
sex trafficking--

10:05.735 --> 10:07.041
Hey, hey, hey,
hold on a second.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.826
I didn't say
I was done talking.

10:11.349 --> 10:12.481
I did find something.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.004
What the hell
are you talking about?

10:14.048 --> 10:17.834
I found her phone
near the boat.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
She must have tossed it
when she was running.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.229
Whose phone?

10:21.272 --> 10:23.666
Ava.

10:27.409 --> 10:31.543
<i>You girls will move
to Russia some day,</i>

10:31.587 --> 10:33.328
<i>live with me.</i>

10:33.371 --> 10:35.678
<i>But it's so cold
over there, no?</i>

10:35.722 --> 10:39.203
<i>When it's cold,
we're going to go to my house</i>

10:39.247 --> 10:40.988
<i>and serve dinner.
- A-ha.</i>

10:41.031 --> 10:44.078
<i>It's nice and warm, huh?</i>

10:44.121 --> 10:45.645
<i>So you're rich then?</i>

10:45.688 --> 10:47.777
Ha, and,

10:47.821 --> 10:50.301
powerful, too, eh?

10:50.345 --> 10:54.697
<i>Soon, I'll be even
more powerful.</i>

10:54.741 --> 10:57.178
<i>That's so cool.</i>

10:57.221 --> 11:02.183
The whole world will know
how powerful Russia is.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.228
<i>America will realize.</i>

11:04.272 --> 11:06.578
<i>Why?
What are you going to do?</i>

11:06.622 --> 11:08.058
<i>I can't tell you this,</i>

11:08.102 --> 11:12.541
but it's going to be big.

11:12.584 --> 11:16.458
It's going to be all over
the news and the internet.

11:16.501 --> 11:22.333
And it's going to
be a very loud boom.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.730
Yeah, that's--that's so cool.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.258
Rublev figured out
she was recording him,

11:34.302 --> 11:37.740
went nuts,
started attacking her.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.916
Arrest this son of a bitch.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.668
Daniel Rublev,
you're under arrest.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.931
Hold on. Arrest?

11:56.585 --> 11:57.934
That's ridiculous.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.283
No, no, no, no.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.156
Hey, not a decision
you want to make.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.204
Hey, hey, hey, step back.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.510
All right,
all right, all right,

12:08.553 --> 12:10.991
I'll take a ride with you.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.470
- Like I was saying,

12:12.514 --> 12:15.299
Daniel Rublev,
you're under arrest.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.866
You're under arrest, too,
now, turn around.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.695
Look,
I know you speak English,

12:19.739 --> 12:20.957
so just turn your
ugly ass around.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.835
You know,
it's so much easier

12:28.878 --> 12:30.575
if you just do what you're told.

12:30.619 --> 12:32.099
Click him.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.855
We're sure we want
to try these two together

12:48.898 --> 12:50.204
in the same trial?

12:50.247 --> 12:53.511
They are equally
culpable and despicable,

12:53.555 --> 12:55.513
and part of the same
criminal enterprise.

12:55.557 --> 13:00.083
There's a lot more evidence
against Sirenko than Rublev.

13:00.127 --> 13:03.130
But the video on
Ava's phone helps a lot,

13:03.173 --> 13:05.262
confirms Rublev was,
at a minimum,

13:05.306 --> 13:07.525
aware of the plan
to bomb the hotel.

13:07.569 --> 13:10.746
And that he's a pedophile
and a rapist.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.793
Yeah, that, too.

13:17.144 --> 13:20.800
Rublev's lawyer just
filed a motion to suppress.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.497
Suppress what?

13:25.239 --> 13:27.328
Your Honor, there is no one
to authenticate the veracity

13:27.371 --> 13:29.112
of the video found on
the phone since the person

13:29.156 --> 13:31.114
who recorded that video
is dead.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.463
Right, right,
because your client

13:32.507 --> 13:34.248
ordered his henchmen
to kill her.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.858
That's enough, Mr. Price.

13:35.902 --> 13:38.121
Mr. Braun's argument
is ridiculous.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.515
Rule 9 of the New York
Rules of Evidence,

13:40.558 --> 13:42.386
it states that the person
who records video

13:42.430 --> 13:44.127
is not required to testify...
- Yeah, but--

13:44.171 --> 13:46.129
Meaning that
it is up to the jury

13:46.173 --> 13:47.696
to decide if it's authentic.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.829
But the burden is on
prosecution to provide

13:49.872 --> 13:51.482
evidence of authenticity.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.920
And since the people
allegedly obtained this phone

13:53.963 --> 13:56.444
from some unknown
confidential informant,

13:56.487 --> 13:58.185
whose name they refuse
to reveal,

13:58.228 --> 13:59.882
they have failed
to meet that burden.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.319
Mr. Price, are you
willing to disclose

14:02.363 --> 14:05.105
your informant's identity
and have them testify?

14:05.148 --> 14:06.671
We can't. We've agreed
to keep this person's name

14:06.715 --> 14:08.151
out of the public record.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.849
Which means there's no way
to authenticate the phone

14:09.892 --> 14:11.415
and, therefore, the video.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.896
Well, if that's the case,
and there's no one else

14:13.940 --> 14:17.857
willing to provide context
as to where and how this phone

14:17.900 --> 14:20.990
was recovered, it's out.

14:21.034 --> 14:24.689
Motion granted.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

14:24.733 --> 14:27.344
You sure we can't persuade
Andre to testify?

14:27.388 --> 14:29.651
We can sweeten
the terms of his deal,

14:29.694 --> 14:30.739
downgrade a few of the charges.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.088
I already tried.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.916
His lawyer laughed at me, literally.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.483
OK.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.920
But we don't have a lot
of evidence against Rublev,

14:37.964 --> 14:40.792
and what we do have
is circumstantial--

14:40.836 --> 14:43.186
a few texts, a few emails,

14:43.230 --> 14:44.622
a few wire transfers,

14:44.666 --> 14:47.843
but nothing that
directly implicates Rublev

14:47.887 --> 14:51.020
in the bombing or the murders.

14:51.064 --> 14:54.154
If Andre's out,
there is only one other person

14:54.197 --> 14:55.895
who can testify
to what Rublev

14:55.938 --> 14:58.419
was actually saying
in that video.

15:01.074 --> 15:04.555
I'll set up a meeting
right away.

15:04.599 --> 15:07.254
We're keeping Nicole
at a safe house for now

15:07.297 --> 15:11.736
until the trial is over,
until we can locate someone

15:11.780 --> 15:12.912
who's willing to take her in.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.391
No family?

15:14.435 --> 15:17.394
Not really, not anybody
who's willing to get involved.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.005
She was living with her mother,

15:19.048 --> 15:21.224
and everything seemed
to be going fine.

15:21.268 --> 15:24.010
She was in school,
she got decent grades.

15:24.053 --> 15:26.577
And then two years ago,
her mother died--

15:26.621 --> 15:29.972
COVID, she had
a pre-existing lung condition.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.670
So then she went
to live with an aunt.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.194
It didn't work out.

15:34.237 --> 15:38.633
Then foster family, and then
she decided to run away,

15:38.676 --> 15:41.679
decided that she would be
better off on her own

15:41.723 --> 15:43.333
out on the street.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.813
At 15?

15:44.856 --> 15:47.729
That's why we need
to take care of this girl.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.689
We need to protect her 'cause
God knows nobody ever has.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.996
No, I get that.
I do.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.042
- Good.
- But right now, we--

15:56.085 --> 15:58.000
we need her to testify.

15:58.044 --> 16:01.743
If there was another way, hey,
trust me, I wouldn't be here.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.052
Can you arrange a meeting?

16:06.095 --> 16:08.532
If you can keep her
off the stand.

16:08.576 --> 16:12.710
That's a hard thing
to guarantee.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.016
I will try my best.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.019
You have my word.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
But I can't make any promises.

16:29.858 --> 16:31.512
Yeah, got it.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.643
Hey.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.258
Well, sometimes you should
let the other guy

16:38.301 --> 16:40.521
come to you instead of
always being on the attack.

16:40.564 --> 16:43.132
No, playing it safe
is no fun.

16:43.176 --> 16:45.178
OK, if you say so.

16:45.221 --> 16:46.614
Do you want to play?

16:46.657 --> 16:51.619
No, we actually have
to head back to the city.

16:51.662 --> 16:53.273
Captain Benson
and the prosecutor

16:53.316 --> 16:55.492
want to talk to you again.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.016
OK.

16:57.059 --> 17:02.021
Um, can we go to Delphina after,
the one on 42nd Street?

17:02.064 --> 17:03.718
Sure.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.676
You get your own
personal makeup artist,

17:05.720 --> 17:09.463
and you get to try on as many
lipsticks and beauty samples

17:09.506 --> 17:10.246
as you want.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.900
It's really cool.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.729
It sounds amazing.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.557
I get to play DJ
in the car, right?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.167
That depends.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.560
- Come on, I have to play--
- Well, no more Taylor Swift.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.476
No more Taylor Swift, OK?
- Oh, my God, fine.

17:23.738 --> 17:24.782
Oh.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.045
Down, down, down, down.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.655
Get down. Stay down, OK?

17:27.698 --> 17:30.179
Stay down on the ground,
you understand me?

17:42.496 --> 17:44.193
- You okay?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.673
No, no, no, no, no.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.066
No, Nicole!

17:53.159 --> 17:54.334
No, no, no. Please.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.911
10-13, 10-13.
Shots fired.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.826
Suspects fleeing northbound
in Lancaster Road

18:08.870 --> 18:10.132
in a black Escalade.

18:10.176 --> 18:11.786
Officer down.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.570
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Stay there, sweetie.

18:13.614 --> 18:15.224
Do not move.

18:17.270 --> 18:20.708
Hey, it's OK, it's OK.
All right, look, look.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.319
You're going to be fine.
All right, help is on the way.

18:23.363 --> 18:26.453
Just gotta hang in there.
Just hang in there.

18:30.239 --> 18:34.025
Dawson, how's Amanda?

18:34.069 --> 18:37.290
Tell me.
Tell me that she's alive.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.161
I tried to stop
the bleeding,

18:39.205 --> 18:41.642
but she was alive
when she left, all right?

18:41.685 --> 18:43.992
The EMTs were working on her,
talking to her,

18:44.035 --> 18:46.168
so that's a good sign, right?

18:46.212 --> 18:48.997
Yeah, that's--that's
a very good sign.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.260
That's a very good sign.

18:51.304 --> 18:54.133
Dawson, what happened?

18:54.176 --> 18:55.830
Where were the shooters?

18:55.873 --> 18:57.658
How did they even know
that you were here?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.835
I have no idea,
they were just here.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.316
They were sitting in the car,
I think, over there.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.492
It was about three,
maybe four of them.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.668
I don't know.
I heard gunshots.

19:07.711 --> 19:10.323
Amanda grabbed Nicole,
pulled her behind the car,

19:10.366 --> 19:12.673
and then I saw Amanda get hit.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.196
And then a shooter
ran up on her,

19:14.240 --> 19:16.894
you know, to finish the job.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.026
Then I shot him.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.420
Okay. Yeah.
You did a good thing.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.857
You saved Amanda's life.
- I hope so.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.206
Where's Nicole?

19:24.250 --> 19:26.382
She's inside.

19:29.429 --> 19:31.126
You're sure that
you're not hurt.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.780
They didn't--they
didn't touch you?

19:32.823 --> 19:33.868
No, no.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.522
I--I stayed--

19:35.565 --> 19:37.524
I hid and I stayed
on the ground.

19:37.567 --> 19:42.442
Amanda, she--she pulled me away
and she saved me.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.358
I'm glad she did.

19:45.401 --> 19:47.577
What happened to her?

19:47.621 --> 19:48.883
Is she--

19:48.926 --> 19:53.366
She's on the way
to the hospital and...

19:53.409 --> 19:55.585
she lost a lot of blood.

19:55.629 --> 20:00.024
So we're going to see.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.243
This is all my fault.

20:01.287 --> 20:03.680
- No.
- If she dies--

20:03.724 --> 20:07.162
No, Nicole,
she's not going to die.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.468
She's not going to die.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.513
And this is not your fault.
Whatever happened,

20:10.557 --> 20:12.646
this has nothing to do with you.
- No, I screwed up.

20:12.689 --> 20:14.038
- I--
- Nicole--

20:14.082 --> 20:15.518
I didn't know.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.607
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.741
Somebody Snapchatted me
this morning--

20:20.784 --> 20:23.091
Wait, what?

20:23.134 --> 20:25.485
And I responded.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
But I--

20:30.316 --> 20:32.318
I asked you to give me
all your devices.

20:32.361 --> 20:33.319
I know.

20:33.362 --> 20:36.191
I...

20:36.235 --> 20:38.280
I-I kept one.

20:38.324 --> 20:41.370
I'm so sorry.

20:44.460 --> 20:48.159
It's OK.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.597
Listen to me.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.076
There's a million ways
that these people

20:52.120 --> 20:55.036
could have found out
where you were staying.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.303
She was hiding a cell phone?

21:01.347 --> 21:03.740
Look, she's a kid.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.613
Yeah, well, I'm glad she's OK.

21:06.656 --> 21:09.137
She's fine
physically, anyway.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.444
What about Detective Rollins?

21:11.487 --> 21:14.055
The doctor said that
her surgery went well.

21:14.098 --> 21:19.278
She's in stable condition but...

21:19.321 --> 21:22.672
hoping for the best.

21:22.716 --> 21:25.762
We can still nail
Rublev and Sirenko,

21:25.806 --> 21:28.722
but we need Nicole's help,
all right?

21:28.765 --> 21:31.202
She's the only person who--
she can tie Rublev to Sirenko.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.335
She's been through a lot,
and if there's any way

21:33.379 --> 21:34.380
that we can do this
without her--

21:34.423 --> 21:35.729
But there isn't.

21:35.772 --> 21:38.166
We need Nicole's testimony.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.646
It's too risky.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.692
We'll protect her.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.912
- Is that a joke?
- No.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.130
I know it's a hard thing
to promise--

21:46.174 --> 21:48.176
It's an impossible thing
to promise.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.178
Well, that doesn't mean
we just ignore the fact

21:50.221 --> 21:52.006
that she's a witness,

21:52.049 --> 21:54.138
and Rublev and
Sirenko are monsters.

21:54.182 --> 21:55.575
They have no boundaries.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.359
They sell young girls,
they kill people.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.795
Hell, they blew up
a damn building.

21:58.839 --> 22:00.188
They gunned down--
- OK.

22:00.231 --> 22:01.537
Are you kidding me?

22:01.581 --> 22:04.801
I know very well who these
people are, trust me.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.629
And I want them just
as much as you do.

22:06.673 --> 22:08.022
Well, then for God's sake,

22:08.065 --> 22:10.024
help me put these
two animals in prison

22:10.067 --> 22:13.027
for the rest
of their damn lives.

22:18.380 --> 22:21.165
Did you call my mom's sister?

22:21.209 --> 22:23.037
Her name is Allison.

22:23.080 --> 22:27.346
We did, but she's...

22:27.389 --> 22:30.218
She's not doing so well
right now.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.480
So--

22:31.524 --> 22:34.396
She said no?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.311
Yeah.

22:36.355 --> 22:41.098
But we're going to find you
someplace to live, Nicole,

22:41.142 --> 22:45.451
someplace safe to live,
I promise you that.

22:47.627 --> 22:50.543
But right now,

22:50.586 --> 22:53.241
I need to ask you
about the case.

22:53.284 --> 22:54.851
Mm-hmm.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.941
About Sirenko and Rublev.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.425
The guys who--

23:03.469 --> 23:05.775
Yes.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.698
And if you don't want
to talk about it,

23:15.742 --> 23:19.136
that is OK with me.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.704
Mm.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.067
Where's Nicole?

23:37.111 --> 23:39.330
She's in Toronto.

23:39.374 --> 23:42.464
Excuse me?

23:42.508 --> 23:45.467
I finally found a relative

23:45.511 --> 23:48.122
that was willing to take her in,

23:48.165 --> 23:53.606
somebody who would help her
and care for her.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.129
What are you saying?

23:55.172 --> 23:57.305
I'm saying that she's
not going to testify.

23:57.348 --> 23:58.611
You sent her away?

23:58.654 --> 24:00.177
You put her on a plane
without consulting me?

24:00.221 --> 24:03.790
I did what I thought
was best for her.

24:03.833 --> 24:06.662
Even if that means
letting Rublev walk free?

24:06.706 --> 24:09.491
Right now,
nothing is more important

24:09.535 --> 24:13.060
than giving this little girl
a chance,

24:13.103 --> 24:16.846
of a semblance
of a normal happy life.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.591
I don't care what
Captain Benson thinks.

24:22.635 --> 24:24.463
She doesn't get to play God.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.987
Get a court order and bring
this girl back to New York.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.206
Not that easy,
according to our

24:29.250 --> 24:32.688
extradition treaty
with Canada, anyway.

24:32.732 --> 24:35.517
If a request for extradition
is made under this treaty

24:35.561 --> 24:37.171
for a person under
the age of 18,

24:37.214 --> 24:39.826
and it is determined that
extradition would disrupt

24:39.869 --> 24:43.090
the social readjustment
of that person,

24:43.133 --> 24:46.572
may be recommended that
the request for extradition

24:46.615 --> 24:47.660
be withdrawn.

24:47.703 --> 24:49.400
Still. Worth a shot.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.272
But to what end?

24:51.315 --> 24:53.535
Excuse me?

24:53.579 --> 24:55.624
I think Benson is right.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.844
This girl, Nicole, is--

24:57.887 --> 25:00.542
She's seen too much.
She's endured too much.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.935
We're not social workers.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.806
Exactly, we're prosecutors.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.026
And our job is to provide

25:06.069 --> 25:08.289
the most compelling evidence possible.

25:08.332 --> 25:10.726
And right now, given what
Nicole has been through,

25:10.770 --> 25:12.554
the defense could use
all that trauma

25:12.598 --> 25:14.817
to its advantage on cross.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.253
It doesn't matter
how composed she is,

25:16.297 --> 25:18.386
the jury will view her
as emotionally disturbed

25:18.429 --> 25:19.953
and unreliable.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.912
So what's your solution?

25:24.740 --> 25:26.525
We cut a deal with Sirenko.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.787
What?

25:27.830 --> 25:30.180
He's as big a thug as Rublev.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.141
But he's less shiny.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.668
The Feds just released
a high-profile

25:39.712 --> 25:43.367
political prisoner
so we could try Rublev,

25:43.411 --> 25:48.024
meaning Rublev is a higher
priority than Sirenko.

25:48.068 --> 25:52.420
Jack, Sirenko is just as bad.

25:52.463 --> 25:54.814
He murdered that
young girl, Ava,

25:54.857 --> 25:59.601
he shot her two times at
close range like it was nothing.

25:59.645 --> 26:02.256
I never said
he was a saint, Nolan.

26:02.299 --> 26:05.651
I'm just telling you
the way it is.

26:05.694 --> 26:09.045
The mandate is to
convict Rublev.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.960
That's what you pushed for.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.920
How you convict him,
I don't really care,

26:13.963 --> 26:17.053
that's up to you,
but you need to get this done.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.758
So you want to
know about Rublev.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.716
Correct.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.544
That's simple.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.721
He provides protection,
contacts, and capital.

26:32.765 --> 26:36.507
If I need something, you know,
something big, I call him.

26:36.551 --> 26:39.902
You know, in exchange, we pay--

26:39.946 --> 26:43.210
we pay a royalty, 10%.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.777
So he's your boss?

26:44.820 --> 26:46.561
Partner.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.956
But I can't really say no
to him, you understand.

26:49.999 --> 26:51.958
I do.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.481
What about the murder--

26:53.524 --> 26:56.615
first murder,
I should say, Ava.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.618
Look, I feel bad.
It's--

26:59.661 --> 27:01.445
There's no need for
any of that, Mr. Sirenko.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.622
- Any of what?
- Hollow remorse.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.624
I don't buy it,
and it certainly

27:05.667 --> 27:07.756
won't move the needle
from a legal perspective.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.932
So do us all a favor,
just tell us what happened,

27:09.976 --> 27:11.978
nothing more.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.373
Rublev likes to
tell these girls

27:16.417 --> 27:18.680
how important he is,

27:18.724 --> 27:23.729
how his friends are very
powerful men back in Russia.

27:23.772 --> 27:28.037
So Ava started recording him,
you know, with her phone.

27:28.081 --> 27:31.301
But Rublev found out
what she was doing.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.826
He starts beating on her.

27:33.869 --> 27:37.699
Now, Ava freaks,
was smashing him with a bottle.

27:37.743 --> 27:40.136
She ran off the boat.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.703
Did you see this?

27:41.747 --> 27:44.575
Are you in the same room
as Ava and Rublev?

27:44.619 --> 27:47.927
No, I was upstairs
having a smoke.

27:47.970 --> 27:51.191
Now, when I seen Ava,
you know, running down the dock

27:51.234 --> 27:52.758
and still walking
towards the bow.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.629
That's when Rublev
comes running over

27:54.673 --> 27:56.457
and tells me what happened.

27:56.500 --> 28:00.374
He says, "Ava's got a video.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.246
She's going to the police."

28:03.290 --> 28:05.727
Did he tell you to kill her?

28:05.771 --> 28:07.773
Yeah.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.993
He said she knew too much.

28:11.037 --> 28:14.823
And so I--so I shot her.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.607
What was Rublev
bragging about?

28:16.651 --> 28:18.958
Why was he so upset?
Why'd he want her dead?

28:19.001 --> 28:21.395
Because he told her
about the bomb.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.399
But can you believe that?

28:25.442 --> 28:27.357
You know, big-shot
Russian politician,

28:27.401 --> 28:31.710
and here he is drinking
a mimosa on a Tuesday morning,

28:31.753 --> 28:33.320
you know,
bragging to some hooker.

28:33.363 --> 28:36.845
Don't you dare call
that little girl a hooker.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.415
OK.

28:41.458 --> 28:44.026
Let me try this again.

28:44.070 --> 28:48.335
Now, here he is drinking
a mimosa on a Tuesday morning

28:48.378 --> 28:50.729
telling some little girl

28:50.772 --> 28:54.080
'bout how he's going to
blow up a building.

28:54.123 --> 28:57.083
No, that's why
he wanted her dead.

28:59.085 --> 29:02.479
If you want the jury
to hear any of this,

29:02.523 --> 29:04.655
you'll need to dismiss
the murder one

29:04.699 --> 29:07.397
and terrorism charges, and,

29:07.441 --> 29:10.357
take life without parole
off the table.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.234
We didn't have a choice.

29:18.278 --> 29:19.714
20 years is still a long time.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.498
But life is longer.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.762
World ain't perfect.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.024
Who knows,
maybe we'll get lucky

29:25.067 --> 29:27.940
and he'll get stabbed
in prison.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.463
I'm not joking.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.465
Price.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.686
Cosgrove gave me a call,

29:35.730 --> 29:37.123
said that you had cut
a deal with Sirenko.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.038
Is that true?

29:39.081 --> 29:40.256
That is correct, yes.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.780
Sirenko is pleading guilty
to murder two,

29:41.823 --> 29:43.172
aiding and abetting
an act of terror--

29:43.216 --> 29:45.131
That's a bunch of crap.
That's a bunch of crap.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.524
Yeah, you're right.

29:47.568 --> 29:49.352
But given the complexity
of the case--

29:49.396 --> 29:50.614
Is that what
you tell yourself?

29:50.658 --> 29:52.355
You know what you did?

29:52.399 --> 29:55.271
You baited the hook with
Sirenko to chase a headline.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.490
Oh.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.448
Senior Russian official
gets convicted

29:58.492 --> 30:00.059
of murder, domestic terror.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.365
That make you and all
the frat boys down in DC

30:02.409 --> 30:03.584
feel all warm and fuzzy?

30:03.627 --> 30:04.759
Slow down, detective.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.282
You don't know me.

30:06.326 --> 30:09.808
But that doesn't change
the reality of the situation,

30:09.851 --> 30:11.331
which is that
we're following orders,

30:11.374 --> 30:12.811
you understand that.

30:12.854 --> 30:14.508
Orders that are coming down
from the attorney general

30:14.551 --> 30:16.118
of the United States.

30:16.162 --> 30:17.380
Huh.

30:17.424 --> 30:18.947
Here's the reality.

30:18.991 --> 30:21.863
This case cost me
the life of my undercover,

30:21.907 --> 30:23.996
so tell all this
to his mother.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.476
His name was Vincent,
by the way.

30:26.520 --> 30:29.175
In case you forgot. Vincent.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.792
I've known Daniel Rublev
for six years.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.968
Was he your boss?

30:40.012 --> 30:41.013
I guess so.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.711
What do you mean
you guess so?

30:43.754 --> 30:48.063
I mean, he doesn't
do any of the work,

30:48.107 --> 30:51.066
but he still gets
a piece of the action,

30:51.110 --> 30:53.503
you know, 10% of the money
we bring in.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.505
How come?

30:55.549 --> 30:58.334
'Cause he's Daniel Rublev.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.249
What's that mean?

31:00.293 --> 31:03.078
You know,
he's got a lot of friends,

31:03.122 --> 31:05.037
powerful friends.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.605
So if I need a,
you know, a favor,

31:08.649 --> 31:11.826
you know,
protection or a loan,

31:11.870 --> 31:13.349
you know, I go to him.

31:13.393 --> 31:17.179
Did Daniel Rublev ask you
to kill Ava Marchenko?

31:17.223 --> 31:18.311
Yes.

31:18.354 --> 31:20.879
Did he ask you
to kill Vincent Lowe?

31:20.922 --> 31:23.490
No, no,
that one I did on my own.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.970
And why's that?

31:25.013 --> 31:27.102
Because he was
a pain in the ass.

31:27.146 --> 31:30.323
He made me nervous.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.716
He asked too many questions.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.544
That's why you killed him?

31:34.588 --> 31:36.677
Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.549
What about the bombing
of the Dunlap Hotel?

31:39.593 --> 31:41.638
Did Rublev order you
to do that?

31:41.682 --> 31:43.162
Yeah.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.903
Did you have any choice
in the matter?

31:44.946 --> 31:48.210
Well, yeah, I could say
yes and live,

31:48.254 --> 31:51.126
or no, and have
some Russian assassin

31:51.170 --> 31:55.087
put two shiny ones
in the back of my head.

31:55.130 --> 31:58.090
So I say yes.

31:58.133 --> 32:00.919
Nothing further.

32:05.271 --> 32:09.492
Mr. Sirenko, you've entered
into a cooperation

32:09.536 --> 32:12.234
agreement with the district
attorney's office, correct?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.801
Yes.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.107
They said that they would
reduce your sentence

32:15.150 --> 32:17.979
if you helped convict
Mr. Rublev?

32:18.023 --> 32:19.589
Yeah, something like that.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.461
So your agenda
is to make sure

32:21.504 --> 32:23.289
that Mr. Rublev is convicted.

32:23.332 --> 32:27.423
My agenda is to make sure
I get out of jail before I'm 60.

32:27.467 --> 32:30.252
But to do that, you've got
to deliver for Mr. Price,

32:30.296 --> 32:33.429
and make sure that
Mr. Rublev is convicted.

32:33.473 --> 32:36.041
No, I'm not sure about that.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.826
Nah, he just told me
to tell the truth.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.828
The truth?

32:40.871 --> 32:42.612
Is that possible?

32:42.656 --> 32:43.962
Excuse me?

32:44.005 --> 32:45.702
Well, you've been
charged with a litany

32:45.746 --> 32:48.009
of heinous crimes--

32:48.053 --> 32:51.143
murder, sex trafficking,

32:51.186 --> 32:52.971
domestic terror.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.408
You're a career criminal.

32:55.451 --> 32:59.151
Today alone, you've
admitted to two murders,

32:59.194 --> 33:03.155
and a bombing that killed
three more innocent people.

33:03.198 --> 33:06.810
How can anyone possibly
believe anything that you say?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.860
You know, just because
I kill people

33:12.903 --> 33:15.515
doesn't mean I'm a liar.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.996
Wow.

33:20.520 --> 33:24.480
You know, that may be the
greatest line I've ever heard.

33:24.524 --> 33:28.136
"Just because I've killed people
doesn't mean I'm a liar."

33:30.921 --> 33:33.185
Nothing further.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.679
Rublev is willing to
disclose state secrets

33:49.723 --> 33:52.073
in exchange for leniency?

33:52.117 --> 33:56.904
His lawyer says Rublev
is terrified that he'll tell us

33:56.947 --> 33:59.080
everything he knows about
the Russian oligarchs,

33:59.124 --> 34:01.343
the Russian president,
the way he does business,

34:01.387 --> 34:03.476
his plans to take over
Eastern Europe.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.086
Who cares?

34:05.130 --> 34:06.435
The State Department
already knows

34:06.479 --> 34:08.655
how the Russian president
does business.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.178
That might be true,

34:10.222 --> 34:13.181
but we need to run it
by the State Department.

34:13.225 --> 34:16.445
No, we know what they'll want
to do, Jack, is cut a deal.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.968
I think you're right.

34:18.012 --> 34:21.146
So if we know the answer,
why even ask the question?

34:21.189 --> 34:25.411
We can't let the State
Department drive the train.

34:25.454 --> 34:30.024
They don't care about victims,
about people, about Ava,

34:30.068 --> 34:32.896
about Stabler's CI, who got
two bullets in his brain,

34:32.940 --> 34:34.420
three bodies incinerated--

34:34.463 --> 34:37.031
Don't do that.

34:38.293 --> 34:41.688
Once again,
I agree with you, Nolan.

34:41.731 --> 34:45.518
But if you're asking me
to bury Rublev's offer

34:45.561 --> 34:51.263
to disclose state secrets,
the answer is no.

34:56.006 --> 34:59.009
I know everything
about the man...

35:01.838 --> 35:05.973
The way he thinks,

35:06.016 --> 35:10.804
the way he does business...

35:10.847 --> 35:13.023
the way he kills.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.287
But before we
get into specifics,

35:15.330 --> 35:17.593
we just need to know that
you're willing to immunize

35:17.637 --> 35:19.334
Mr. Rublev.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.597
Immunize?

35:21.641 --> 35:22.859
Are you out of your mind?

35:22.903 --> 35:24.905
He's responsible
for four murders.

35:24.948 --> 35:26.950
He's the single
most important witness

35:26.994 --> 35:28.996
in the history of this country.

35:29.039 --> 35:30.911
Russia is this
country's greatest fear,

35:30.954 --> 35:32.173
its greatest threat.

35:32.217 --> 35:34.567
And my client
sitting right here

35:34.610 --> 35:38.223
knows everything there is
to know about it--everything.

35:38.266 --> 35:42.270
And he's willing to share these
intimate and haunting details

35:42.314 --> 35:45.665
with the State Department.
- Immunity is not an option.

35:45.708 --> 35:46.796
Then we'll go over your head.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.971
We'll call the
Secretary of State.

35:48.015 --> 35:49.321
Well, call him.

35:49.364 --> 35:51.192
Call the president, too.
I don't care.

35:51.236 --> 35:54.891
The DA's office is in charge
of this case, not the Feds,

35:54.935 --> 35:56.197
which means right now,

35:56.241 --> 35:59.331
I am the only person
that matters, no one else.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.160
And immunity is off the table.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.770
I don't care what he knows.

36:03.813 --> 36:08.340
Don't go.

36:08.383 --> 36:11.430
Please.

36:11.473 --> 36:15.173
I need your help.

36:15.216 --> 36:18.741
I need you to help my family.

36:18.785 --> 36:22.571
Keep them safe. Please.

36:28.969 --> 36:31.754
You feel good about yourself?

36:31.798 --> 36:33.713
Couldn't do it, Sam.

36:33.756 --> 36:37.543
Just couldn't bring myself
to roll over for this pig,

36:37.586 --> 36:41.286
regardless of what he knows
or claims to know.

36:41.329 --> 36:44.245
I know,
but the State Department

36:44.289 --> 36:46.334
is going to give this bastard
whatever he asks for.

36:46.378 --> 36:50.033
- It's our case, not theirs.
- For now.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.131
Come on.

37:02.611 --> 37:03.960
- Hey!
- Come on!

37:04.874 --> 37:06.702
Right there!
Let's go!

37:06.746 --> 37:07.964
Call 911.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.749
Jasper has been shot.

37:12.055 --> 37:14.275
Please. Help.

37:16.146 --> 37:18.888
Help. Please.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.282
Please.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.110
All right, just--
just keep breathing.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.895
Just hang on.
Hang on, hang on.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.466
The ambulance
will be here soon.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.903
Hey. Hey.

37:56.317 --> 38:00.234
Daniel Rublev was
pronounced dead at 3:42 PM.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.149
The New York Police Department
and the FBI

38:02.192 --> 38:04.325
are working together
in conjunction with

38:04.369 --> 38:06.022
the Manhattan
District Attorney's Office

38:06.066 --> 38:08.329
to investigate this matter.

38:08.373 --> 38:11.680
Mr. Price, with Rublev dead,
what happens to Mark Sirenko?

38:11.724 --> 38:14.161
You cut a deal with him
in exchange for his testimony

38:14.204 --> 38:17.295
against Rublev,
so now what happens?

38:17.338 --> 38:21.299
Mr. Sirenko pled guilty
to five counts of murder two.

38:21.342 --> 38:24.389
He also informed
on his organization.

38:24.432 --> 38:27.566
So Sirenko still gets to ride
the benefit of the plea deal,

38:27.609 --> 38:31.483
even though Rublev was killed,
is that what you're saying?

38:34.747 --> 38:38.403
What I'm saying is,

38:38.446 --> 38:42.363
though this case
was highly unusual,

38:42.407 --> 38:46.976
in many respects,
and the trial was cut short

38:47.020 --> 38:50.023
due to unforeseen circumstances,

38:50.066 --> 38:54.462
we feel that justice
has been served,

38:54.506 --> 38:57.291
that Daniel Rublev,
Mark Sirenko,

38:57.335 --> 39:00.816
and all of their accomplices,
will be,

39:00.860 --> 39:03.602
<i>or have been punished
for their reprehensible--</i>

39:03.645 --> 39:05.386
- Let me see your hands. <i>
- Actions.</i>

39:05.430 --> 39:08.607
- Against the wall, now!
- Hands up, now.

39:08.650 --> 39:12.437
Hey, ah, it's OK.
It's OK, I'm here to help.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.221
I'm here to save you.

39:25.537 --> 39:28.453
20 years.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.280
20 years is a long time.

39:30.324 --> 39:32.413
Not long enough.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.808
Not for what that man did.

39:35.851 --> 39:39.115
You said he'd pay.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.075
I'm a cop, not a judge.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.686
There has to be some way

39:44.730 --> 39:49.996
to punish these people
so we feel safe.

39:50.039 --> 39:52.607
I wish there was, sweetie.

39:52.651 --> 39:56.219
I wish there was.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.265
<i>But there isn't.</i>

39:58.308 --> 40:00.572
<i>It's impossible.</i>

40:00.615 --> 40:06.273
<i>There's no magic wand I can
wave or speech I can give.</i>

40:06.316 --> 40:10.886
<i>So we do the things we can do,
like rescuing the victims</i>

40:10.930 --> 40:14.847
<i>and helping them
feel safe and whole.</i>

40:14.890 --> 40:18.677
<i>It's not always easy
or possible, but we try.</i>

40:18.720 --> 40:21.462
<i>And we do our best to arrest
the criminals and predators</i>

40:21.506 --> 40:26.598
<i>so they can't hurt
anyone else.</i>

40:26.641 --> 40:29.078
<i>But there's still a lot
of good in this world,</i>

40:29.122 --> 40:31.951
<i>so we need to focus on that.</i>

40:31.994 --> 40:36.782
<i>Although, simple, priceless
moments we seem to overlook,</i>

40:36.825 --> 40:39.741
<i>like right now,
you and me having lunch,</i>

40:39.785 --> 40:44.964
<i>or watching the sunset
or the view of Manhattan</i>

40:45.007 --> 40:48.097
<i>late at night from
the 59th Street Bridge.</i>

40:51.100 --> 40:55.191
<i>The world isn't perfect, Lily,</i>

40:55.235 --> 40:57.846
<i>but it's still beautiful.</i>
