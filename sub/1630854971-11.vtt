00:01.566 --> 00:02.959
<i>Previously on "Superman and Lois"...</i>

00:02.959 --> 00:05.657
I've known about the double
mastectomy since day one.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.616
It just feels like every day
I lose something.

00:07.616 --> 00:09.444
You'll still be you.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.098
You looked annoyed
that I came to talk to you

00:11.098 --> 00:12.447
when you were with him.

00:12.447 --> 00:13.970
Stop making me feel weird
whenever I'm around you.

00:13.970 --> 00:16.407
Sometimes I really wish
I never fell in love with you.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.539
- Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

00:17.539 --> 00:19.715
Go! Go!

00:21.369 --> 00:23.153
<i>We're gonna charge her
with a DUI.</i>

00:23.153 --> 00:24.850
- Somebody saved us.
- Junior.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.200
There's no way we could
have just gotten out.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
Is that Superman?

00:28.071 --> 00:30.030
This Superman is how I found
the cure to save your mom.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.944
<i>Your mother's dying.
She needs you.</i>

00:31.944 --> 00:33.685
The cure, it works.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.689
Come on, Kent.
I know he's got powers.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.778
I know it was him.
- No, it wasn't.

00:39.778 --> 00:42.738
I'll explain it
all to you tomorrow.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.827
She's gone.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.959
<i>- You did it.
- We did it.</i>

00:58.101 --> 00:59.668
Where is it coming from?

00:59.668 --> 01:01.539
Someone get me eyes
on the shooter!

01:07.937 --> 01:09.721
This is Peia.

01:09.721 --> 01:12.594
There are no bullets!

01:15.597 --> 01:17.338
These fake attacks
keep happening.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.122
When's this gonna
stop, Superman?

01:19.122 --> 01:21.037
I'm working on it.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.608
<i>Any sign of Peia?</i>

01:26.608 --> 01:28.088
Seems like she's everywhere.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.741
Whatever cure she
got from Mannheim

01:29.741 --> 01:31.743
must have kicked
her powers up tenfold.

01:31.743 --> 01:33.919
It's throwing me off.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.965
I can't tell where she
and Bruno are hiding.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.488
If you don't
figure it out soon,

01:37.488 --> 01:39.142
I'm worried someone's
gonna get hurt.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.535
We need to stop her!

01:49.196 --> 01:51.546
<i>There will be
a little discomfort.</i>

01:51.546 --> 01:54.331
But once this is done,
you'll be all prepped

01:54.331 --> 01:55.941
for tomorrow's surgery.

01:55.941 --> 02:00.076
Now, once you're numb,
I'll be using ultrasound

02:00.076 --> 02:02.122
to locate the problematic
lymph nodes,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.559
then injecting
a tiny radar reflector.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.822
So you can biopsy it
during surgery

02:06.822 --> 02:09.781
and find out if the chemo's
been working--I got it.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.740
You all set
for your recovery?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.829
Bags are packed.
Boys are prepping the house.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.613
And, uh, tonight we're hosting
some friends

02:15.613 --> 02:18.138
for her last meal
before the surgery.

02:19.748 --> 02:23.578
I know how scary this is--
having a bilateral mastectomy.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.362
But I promise,
I'll do everything I can

02:25.362 --> 02:27.799
to get the surgery done right.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.237
- Thanks.
- So will I.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.992
<i>The subway car
is almost ready...</i>

02:46.992 --> 02:49.343
get us to the plane.

02:49.343 --> 02:53.303
This time tomorrow, we'll
be halfway around the world.

02:56.828 --> 02:59.440
House on the beach...

02:59.440 --> 03:01.920
that was always
your mother's dream.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.228
Sir?
A word.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.494
Yeah.

03:12.757 --> 03:17.109
All I ever wanted was
for you to have a normal life.

03:17.109 --> 03:20.635
Now, because
of what you did for me--

03:20.635 --> 03:23.812
Mom, it's okay.
It was worth the risk.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.466
You gave up
being with Natalie.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.685
But I got you back.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.905
And you're finally
healthy again,

03:29.905 --> 03:33.213
for the first time
in I don't know how long.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.693
That's what matters.
- Mm.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.913
What did I ever do
to deserve you?

03:37.913 --> 03:39.610
You dealt with Dad
for so long.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.659
Matteo,
come give us a hand.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.487
Yes, sir.

04:04.374 --> 04:08.117
It just--wow, you know,
like, you're Superman.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.121
But you were always
such, like, a wiry little kid

04:12.121 --> 04:13.949
in high school, though.
- Yep.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.646
It doesn't make
any sense.

04:15.646 --> 04:18.997
Um, by the way, I-I really
appreciate you not--

04:18.997 --> 04:21.522
not lasering my ass
that time that I, uh...

04:21.522 --> 04:23.306
pantsed you in gym class.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.743
Maybe we just, uh,
don't do it again.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.702
Hey, those days
are long gone.

04:27.702 --> 04:30.313
Okay.

04:30.313 --> 04:33.534
Um, so all I ask
is that you keep

04:33.534 --> 04:35.666
everything
I just told you a secret.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.973
Oh, y-yeah.
Yeah, of course.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.367
Uh, anything you say, Superman.

04:40.367 --> 04:43.500
Ah, let's, uh--let's
just stick with Kent.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.372
Got it.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.288
- Um...
- Yeah.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.553
Crazy, right?

04:52.553 --> 04:54.337
Babe, I went flying.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.513
Oh, my God, it killed me not
to tell you that.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.776
I am so glad
that you finally know

04:58.776 --> 05:00.909
and we can put all this
behind us.

05:00.909 --> 05:03.912
Yeah, except, uh,
I already did know, right?

05:03.912 --> 05:05.783
And when I went to talk
to you about it,

05:05.783 --> 05:07.568
you acted like I was crazy.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.310
Babe, I--
you heard Clark.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
I had to protect
the secret.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.097
Okay, still doesn't change
the fact that you lied to me.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.881
Kyle.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.275
This--this is funny to you?

05:19.275 --> 05:21.190
You made me feel stupid.

05:23.671 --> 05:26.326
I didn't have a choice.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.415
See, I-I've said
those exact words,

05:28.415 --> 05:30.242
you know, several times,

05:30.242 --> 05:32.201
always with the best
of intentions,

05:32.201 --> 05:33.594
and it never ended well.

05:33.594 --> 05:35.813
Kyle, you are overreacting.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.902
Oh, I really
don't think I am.

05:37.902 --> 05:39.600
Oh--

05:47.912 --> 05:49.349
<i>We'll be right down, Lana.</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:51.220
Please,
can I just go home?

05:51.220 --> 05:53.091
No chance.

05:53.091 --> 05:56.878
Until you earn my trust back,
where I go, you go.

05:56.878 --> 05:59.446
Because of me, Dad figured
out Mr. Kent's secret,

05:59.446 --> 06:01.709
and Jordan's so angry,
he won't even answer my texts.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.841
I spoke to Clark.
It's all good.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.844
And if you want to make up with
Jordan, just go talk to him.

06:08.542 --> 06:10.544
- Hey.
- Hey, Lana.

06:11.849 --> 06:15.200
- Hi.
- Good seeing you.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.028
Hey, sweetie.

06:17.028 --> 06:20.510
So Lois told me everything
that's going on.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.382
Are you doing okay?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.862
As long as the Mannheims
are free, no one is safe.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.647
They can't run forever.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.435
Uh, that's for another time.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.219
Tonight is all about Lois.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.700
- Amen.
- Smells great.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.833
Uh, what's on the menu?
- You know, a little, uh...

06:38.833 --> 06:40.878
- Bazoombas?
- Yes.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.532
Lois has
a great sense of humor.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.317
She does.

06:45.317 --> 06:48.320
- I smell Bazoombas.
- Yeah, you do.

06:50.453 --> 06:55.327
<i>♪ Come back to mine,
to mine ♪</i>

06:55.327 --> 06:59.767
<i>♪ I found a list of things
I never told you... ♪</i>

06:59.767 --> 07:03.074
I know what Matteo
did was wrong, but...

07:03.074 --> 07:06.164
now he's just gone.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.039
I really miss him.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.955
That really sucks.
I'm sorry.

07:13.955 --> 07:17.611
You know, even if it's just
to say goodbye,

07:17.611 --> 07:20.483
I just want to talk
to him one more time...

07:20.483 --> 07:22.703
tell him how I feel.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.492
I'll be right back.

07:33.148 --> 07:36.717
Okay.
Why are you being like this?

07:36.717 --> 07:39.371
I said I was sorry.

07:39.371 --> 07:42.549
You're only sorry
because I saved your life.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.812
And that's why you feel bad
about what you said to me.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.248
No, it was a stupid fight,

07:46.248 --> 07:48.729
and we both said things
that we didn't mean.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.687
I meant everything I said.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.951
Oh, come on, Jordan,
that's--

07:53.951 --> 07:56.519
I thought we were friends.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.042
So did I.

08:02.873 --> 08:06.964
Okay, um, well, good luck
at the hospital.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.533
<i>My mouth is on fire.</i>

08:10.533 --> 08:13.754
These Tallahassee hot wings
are not screwing around.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.671
They're actually
not that bad.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.282
See? It's what
they're known for--the wings.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.719
The wings.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.941
This is perfect.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.247
I wasn't sure I was gonna be
able to face tomorrow,

08:29.247 --> 08:31.423
but I feel ready.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.209
Thank you.
- I love you.

08:37.125 --> 08:39.214
Yeah.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.695
Oh, who would have thought
Bazoombas would make me cry?

09:30.395 --> 09:33.268
Phone?

09:33.268 --> 09:35.575
You're enjoying this part
way too much.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.924
Yeah.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.914
How are you feeling,
Miss Lane?

10:10.914 --> 10:12.568
- I'm ready.
- Good.

10:12.568 --> 10:15.702
Dr. Lincoln and the team
are on the way.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.414
- Dishwasher's clean.
- Oh, gosh.

10:32.414 --> 10:34.895
I didn't see you there.

10:34.895 --> 10:37.332
Honey, what are you
doing up so early?

10:37.332 --> 10:40.683
I can't sleep.

10:40.683 --> 10:41.902
Hey.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.863
Hey.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.343
Talk to me.

10:48.343 --> 10:51.389
Jordan hates me.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.609
That is physically
not possible.

10:53.609 --> 10:56.699
He hates me,
and he should, I mean...

10:56.699 --> 10:58.483
because I ruined everything.

10:58.483 --> 11:01.530
I messed up my car,
our friendship,

11:01.530 --> 11:05.316
I mean, my whole life.

11:05.316 --> 11:08.363
A DUI stays on your record
for five years.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.452
How am I gonna apply
to college?

11:10.452 --> 11:12.933
I don't know...

11:12.933 --> 11:16.501
but we will figure
this out together.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.025
There's nothing
to figure out.

11:18.025 --> 11:20.984
I mean, my life is
basically over now.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.943
I'm never getting
out of Smallville.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.382
Um, I am...

11:27.382 --> 11:29.340
gonna reach out
to Dr. Lawrence

11:29.340 --> 11:32.430
and see if she can fit you in.
- I don't want to see her.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.741
It's really important
to talk this through.

11:38.741 --> 11:42.136
Okay, honey?
It'll help.

11:43.964 --> 11:47.228
If you want me
to see the shrink, fine,

11:47.228 --> 11:49.360
but it's not gonna
undo everything

11:49.360 --> 11:51.972
that I just did, Mom.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.757
Sarah...

12:10.991 --> 12:14.342
- What are you doing here?
- You tracked my suit.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.826
Of course you did.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.436
Are you meeting him?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.307
Is he here?
- No.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.703
But I was hoping
he might be.

12:27.703 --> 12:31.707
Matteo is gone.
He made his choice.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.405
But it's not that simple.
He was just helping his mom.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.798
He broke the law.

12:35.798 --> 12:38.496
I mean, what he did
wasn't that bad.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.237
Tell that to the DOD

12:40.237 --> 12:42.152
or the people of Metropolis
who are scared

12:42.152 --> 12:44.807
because of what Matteo
unleashed into this world.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.201
How could you possibly
think that's okay?

12:51.118 --> 12:53.294
You need
to let him go, Nat.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.862
But I still love him.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.168
I can't just turn my back
on someone I love

12:58.168 --> 12:59.474
'cause they made a mistake.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.433
This is not about him.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.870
This is about you.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.049
If they find Matteo,
they're gonna send him away

13:09.049 --> 13:11.181
to a DOD facility
for a long time.

13:11.181 --> 13:13.270
And if they don't find him,

13:13.270 --> 13:16.404
you're gonna be left
waiting around for a ghost.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.844
I know what it's like to
be stuck in the past, Bug.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.369
I don't want that for you.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.681
Maybe you're right.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.552
It happens from time to time.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.034
Come on.

13:38.034 --> 13:40.254
Last one home
makes the pancakes.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.268
Looks like
the whole family's here.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.053
I'm Dr. Lincoln, and I'll be
performing your mom's surgery.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.012
Dr. Brennan
is our anesthesiologist,

13:59.012 --> 14:01.101
and we'll also have
our fellow, Dr. Lee,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.798
and nurse practitioner, Abigail,

14:02.798 --> 14:04.321
with us in the
operating room.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.934
Are we supposed to remember
all their names?

14:07.934 --> 14:09.718
Do you have
any questions for us?

14:09.718 --> 14:11.328
Uh, yeah, I got one.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.592
Um, what's the deal
with, uh, aspiration?

14:14.592 --> 14:16.768
Lois hasn't eaten
since last night,

14:16.768 --> 14:18.379
so it's highly unlikely that--

14:18.379 --> 14:20.598
Her entire diagnosis
was unlikely.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.252
So what will you do

14:22.252 --> 14:23.732
if my daughter starts
choking during surgery?

14:23.732 --> 14:25.168
Dad--

14:25.168 --> 14:27.127
There are risks
with any surgery,

14:27.127 --> 14:30.347
but the greater risk would be
not to perform a mastectomy.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.829
Uh, uh, I-I can't do this.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.836
I got it.

14:45.058 --> 14:46.798
Hey, man.
Are you good?

14:46.798 --> 14:49.366
- I-I can barely breathe.
- Okay, okay.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.586
- That's just a panic attack.
- No, no, this is weird.

14:51.586 --> 14:54.719
Okay, okay, come on, deep
breaths, just like we used to.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.766
Can you breathe in and hold?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.855
And out. Good.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.727
It's not working.
- Okay, try again.

15:02.727 --> 15:05.556
- Hey, is he okay?
- I-I don't--

15:05.556 --> 15:08.255
I-I can't close my eyes.

15:08.255 --> 15:11.258
Dude, they're closed.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.131
Your X-ray
vision's coming in.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.141
How--how do I make it stop?
How do you make it stop?

15:25.141 --> 15:27.883
Okay, Jordan, Jordan,
time to calm down.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.233
Time to calm down, okay?

15:30.233 --> 15:32.844
For Mom.
- Okay. Okay.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.803
We're going to do this
at the same time.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.500
Okay.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.459
I want you to breathe in...

15:38.459 --> 15:41.505
And hold and out.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.638
Good. Again.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.120
And hold.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.950
Okay, we are on our way.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.386
Train's ready.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.176
Thank you for never
giving up on me.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.265
Forever and always.

16:04.224 --> 16:07.357
Ugh. Which one of us is
in high school again?

16:07.357 --> 16:08.968
You.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.232
Get used to it.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.799
There'll be more of that
where we're going.

16:14.799 --> 16:17.237
Mom? Mom?

16:17.237 --> 16:19.935
Mom, it's okay.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.593
Everything okay?

16:25.593 --> 16:27.464
Yeah, all good.

16:31.555 --> 16:32.948
What is that?

16:32.948 --> 16:35.516
Dad, what's happeningto her?

16:36.908 --> 16:38.606
Peia.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.833
Day's off to a great start.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.670
Okay, great,
everything's...

16:59.670 --> 17:01.585
out again.

17:01.585 --> 17:05.198
Entire city's down--
power, phone, internet.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.764
Hospital generators
are shielded

17:06.764 --> 17:08.114
against a surge like that.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.203
Still knocked half
of them offline.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.988
The Mannheims
must be somewhere nearby.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.642
Peia's sound attacks
have stopped.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.384
She's quiet for the first time
since she escaped.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.864
Pumpkin, I'm sorry,
but I got to call John Henry,

17:19.864 --> 17:22.954
meet him at the DOD, try to
get ahead of whatever this is.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.652
Peia knows
today's my surgery.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.654
We talked about it
before she broke out.

17:26.654 --> 17:30.527
What are you thinking,
she's trying to hurt you?

17:30.527 --> 17:33.356
No. If she wanted to kill me,
she could have.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.532
This is something else.

17:35.532 --> 17:39.841
The surge
and now this silence...

17:39.841 --> 17:42.322
So you think
Peia's losing control?

17:45.542 --> 17:49.068
I don't think
Bruno's cure worked.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.419
Dad, what's wrong with her?

17:52.419 --> 17:53.985
It's okay.

17:53.985 --> 17:57.163
She just needs
another dose of the cure.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.775
Where are the vials?
- In cold storage on the train.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.125
- Oh!
- Then get them out!

18:03.125 --> 18:05.258
Don't worry.
You're okay.

18:05.258 --> 18:09.697
Dad's got this.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.576
- We need to talk.
- Not now, Lana.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.796
- Yes, now.
- Hey--

18:21.796 --> 18:25.582
Jeez, did you and Chrissy get
in an argument or something?

18:25.582 --> 18:28.585
Whatever,
it's not my business.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.326
Kyle, Sarah's in trouble.

18:30.326 --> 18:32.023
That tends to happen
when you get a DUI.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.287
What'd you expect?
- Would you just listen to me?

18:34.287 --> 18:36.898
There is something
really wrong with Sarah,

18:36.898 --> 18:39.683
and I need your help.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.381
Okay.

18:41.381 --> 18:44.035
O-o-okay, you just t-tell me
what happened.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.037
She was up all night,

18:46.037 --> 18:48.779
spiraling
about the car, Jordan.

18:48.779 --> 18:51.956
I haven't seen her
like this...

18:51.956 --> 18:55.003
not since...

18:55.003 --> 18:56.831
Okay, we--we should go.

19:03.011 --> 19:04.491
Bro, you're acting

19:04.491 --> 19:06.754
like something terrible
just happened.

19:06.754 --> 19:09.539
'Cause it did.

19:09.539 --> 19:12.281
How are you not stoked?

19:12.281 --> 19:14.153
You have X-ray vision.

19:14.153 --> 19:18.026
Why do my powers always come
out at the worst possible time?

19:18.026 --> 19:19.854
Okay, you know
what happens to me

19:19.854 --> 19:21.638
when I'm in a really bad spot?

19:21.638 --> 19:23.162
Nothing.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.860
I'm just still
in a really bad spot,

19:25.860 --> 19:29.037
and I don't get
some superpower.

19:29.037 --> 19:31.213
You should consider
yourself lucky.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.825
What if it happens
during Mom's surgery

19:34.825 --> 19:36.523
and I can't turn it off
this time?

19:36.523 --> 19:38.133
Bro, you have to chill.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.962
This is why your powers
come up at random times.

19:40.962 --> 19:44.052
You need to try
and relax

19:44.052 --> 19:47.098
and breathe
and just let go.

19:47.098 --> 19:50.406
And I'm--
I'm sure you'll be fine.

19:50.406 --> 19:53.017
Can you do that?

19:53.017 --> 19:55.846
Right.
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.674
Thank you.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.461
Oh, but I'm never looking
over there again.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.463
Some lady just gave birth
to triplets.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.773
<i>The generators are online,</i>

20:09.773 --> 20:11.993
and we're ready to go,
if you still are.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.603
Yes.

20:13.603 --> 20:15.126
Uh, with all that's gone on,

20:15.126 --> 20:18.521
maybe we should consider rescheduling.

20:18.521 --> 20:22.264
It took everything I had
to psych myself up for this.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.005
I don't think
I can do it again.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.398
Right.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.617
But if that sound
happens again--

20:27.617 --> 20:30.838
Clark, you wanted
a perfect day for my surgery?

20:30.838 --> 20:34.450
Well, good or bad,
this is what we have.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.539
Can you make it work?

20:38.541 --> 20:39.977
Of course I can.

20:39.977 --> 20:42.197
Then let's get this
over with, please.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.856
Dad, you have to hurry!

20:53.948 --> 20:55.558
Almost there.

20:59.475 --> 21:01.129
It's all right.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.436
Dr. Hook said you
might need another dose.

21:06.482 --> 21:08.136
Better.

21:08.136 --> 21:11.270
See?
You're gonna be fine.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.588
Dad, she needs a doctor!
The cure isn't working!

21:25.588 --> 21:27.024
It will!

21:27.024 --> 21:29.592
I can fix this.

21:29.592 --> 21:32.073
- Aah!
- Get me another vial!

21:32.073 --> 21:33.683
No!

21:39.341 --> 21:42.170
I'm getting her help.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.433
Dad, I'm getting her help.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.567
Matteo!
Matteo!

21:47.567 --> 21:48.829
Matteo.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.791
- We went too far.
- Peia...

21:54.791 --> 21:57.577
I didn't--
I didn't want any of this.

21:57.577 --> 22:00.188
This is not your fault.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.451
You just need more
of the cure.

22:02.451 --> 22:04.366
It's over.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.978
You have to stop.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.893
Peia!

22:09.893 --> 22:13.201
Bruno, you can't save me.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.942
Peia, no.

22:14.942 --> 22:17.379
No. Wait.

22:45.842 --> 22:47.844
You got this.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.803
So do you.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.720
We love you, Mom.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.026
We'll be here
when you wake up.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.457
Okay, um, I've got
to check in at the DOD.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.328
Are you guys good to stay here?

23:37.328 --> 23:40.288
- Don't worry, Dad.
- We'll make sure Mom's okay.

23:45.206 --> 23:48.383
I still can't get a location
on that last sonic disturbance.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.821
Tell me some good news.

23:51.821 --> 23:54.084
- Lois just went into surgery.
- She what?

23:54.084 --> 23:57.784
It was her choice. I promised
her we could handle this.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.351
We know the Mannheims are
still somewhere in Metropolis.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.136
Or at least Peia is.

24:02.136 --> 24:04.138
What on Earth did
Bruno do to her?

24:04.138 --> 24:06.140
I don't know,
but we need to find them

24:06.140 --> 24:08.925
before it's too late.

24:11.928 --> 24:15.105
Oh, come on.

24:15.105 --> 24:17.717
Come--

24:17.717 --> 24:19.936
Come on, something's
got to be working!

24:19.936 --> 24:22.896
Matteo Mannheim.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.506
Who's there?

24:24.506 --> 24:26.334
<i>Scanning voice print.</i>

24:26.334 --> 24:29.337
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

24:34.385 --> 24:38.564
<i>Natalie Irons will be arriving
in three, two...</i>

24:41.218 --> 24:43.743
Nat?

24:43.743 --> 24:45.353
Are you here to arrest me?

24:45.353 --> 24:47.747
What? No, I've been worried
sick about you.

24:47.747 --> 24:50.750
Are you okay?

24:50.750 --> 24:53.622
It's my mom. Something's
wrong with her, and I--

24:53.622 --> 24:54.797
Was it from the cure
you gave her?

24:54.797 --> 24:56.407
Look, I didn't know, okay?

24:56.407 --> 24:58.279
My dad told me it would work,
and it didn't,

24:58.279 --> 24:59.976
and now he
won't even listen to--

24:59.976 --> 25:01.369
Okay, calm down.
I'm here now.

25:01.369 --> 25:03.545
We'll figure it out.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.767
Get away from my son.

25:13.990 --> 25:17.211
Look, this is
gonna be tough,

25:17.211 --> 25:20.257
but, uh, we need
to have a talk...

25:20.257 --> 25:22.608
as a family.

25:22.608 --> 25:26.394
Your father and I are worried
about you.

25:26.394 --> 25:29.484
Yeah, I'm--I'm worried
about me, too.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.228
Hey, look, I...

25:34.228 --> 25:36.230
I know what it's like
to make a mistake

25:36.230 --> 25:39.276
that feels like
the end of the world.

25:39.276 --> 25:43.237
And he's not just talking
about the affair.

25:43.237 --> 25:48.024
My problems started
back when I was your age...

25:48.024 --> 25:49.722
when I started drinking.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.202
Dad, I'm--
I'm not an alcoholic.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.464
No, I-I know.

25:53.464 --> 25:56.032
That's not what
this is about, okay?

25:56.032 --> 26:00.036
It's--it's
about the sadness.

26:00.036 --> 26:04.040
You know, for a while there,
my--my life felt like, um...

26:04.040 --> 26:07.827
just one bad decision
after another.

26:07.827 --> 26:10.525
I lost your <i>abuelita</i>
when I was young.

26:10.525 --> 26:13.659
And I couldn't keep up
with school.

26:13.659 --> 26:18.533
About the only time I felt
like I wasn't a screwup is...

26:18.533 --> 26:22.015
when I was drinking, ironically.

26:22.015 --> 26:25.975
And then I made
the worst decision of all...

26:25.975 --> 26:29.065
and it cost me dearly.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.633
And that's when I knew
I hit rock bottom.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.635
I knew I had to make a change.

26:33.635 --> 26:35.289
The hardest part is,

26:35.289 --> 26:38.074
I don't even know
if I'm at rock bottom.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.815
It's just really scary

26:39.815 --> 26:43.514
to think about things
getting even worse.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.865
Well, look, the only one
who gets to decide

26:45.865 --> 26:49.172
where you are,
<i>mi'jita,</i> is you.

26:50.696 --> 26:52.654
Truth be told...

26:52.654 --> 26:54.787
sometimes I still feel
like I'm falling.

26:54.787 --> 26:57.659
But I look at the ground
beneath my feet,

26:57.659 --> 27:01.315
and I know why I'm here
on this Earth...

27:01.315 --> 27:05.885
you know, to help my town...

27:05.885 --> 27:08.322
to be your dad.

27:08.322 --> 27:10.672
And that gets me through...

27:10.672 --> 27:12.369
every single time.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.328
Yeah, but...

27:14.328 --> 27:17.505
I don't know
what I want to do.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.289
Well, look, for starters,

27:19.289 --> 27:21.901
you can just put down
whatever it is you don't need--

27:21.901 --> 27:25.339
you know, your--your guilt,
your fears.

27:25.339 --> 27:29.299
Replace all that with something
that gives you purpose,

27:29.299 --> 27:31.562
you know, something...

27:31.562 --> 27:34.957
that gives you a sense
of responsibility...

27:34.957 --> 27:37.307
something like, uh...

27:42.530 --> 27:44.401
Seriously?

27:46.055 --> 27:48.536
- Baby steps.
- Mom.

27:48.536 --> 27:52.932
It's a long journey,
<i>mi'jita...</i>

27:52.932 --> 27:55.282
but you got to start somewhere.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.678
I'll only say it
one more time.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.375
Step away from my son.

28:01.375 --> 28:05.074
No, you don't understand.
I'm here to help.

28:11.602 --> 28:14.127
What are you gonna do--kill me?

28:14.127 --> 28:16.129
Do it.

28:16.129 --> 28:17.957
Show the kind of man
you really are.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.307
- Dad? Dad?
- Look, Mr. Irons.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.396
Mr. Irons, Mr. Irons, wait,
wait, wait, please, please.

28:22.396 --> 28:25.442
It's my mom.
She needs help.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.706
Where is she?

28:29.098 --> 28:33.537
Look, I know how this feels.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.757
You don't have much time,

28:35.757 --> 28:38.891
so stop wasting it
fighting me...

28:38.891 --> 28:41.720
and let us help you.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.510
It's Mom.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.991
Come on.
We got to get to the roof.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.538
Can't stop now.

29:17.538 --> 29:19.540
Do everything you can
to keep the patient stable.

29:19.540 --> 29:21.411
Is Mom okay?

29:24.458 --> 29:26.416
For now.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.244
Somebody get me
a damn reading.

29:28.244 --> 29:29.724
Where the hell is she?

29:31.813 --> 29:32.945
Got her.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.979
Peia!

30:13.986 --> 30:16.466
Stay away from me!

30:16.466 --> 30:19.208
Let me help you!

30:19.208 --> 30:22.168
You can't, Superman.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.824
No one can now.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.132
No!

30:39.925 --> 30:41.535
Peia.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.711
We have to get to her.
We got to do something.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.540
Dad. Dad.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.716
Fly me.
Fly me to her.

30:50.761 --> 30:52.459
Natalie, please.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.591
You can't be near her
right now--you'll die.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.463
I'm sorry.

30:58.508 --> 31:02.686
Dad.
- Come here.

31:04.471 --> 31:08.127
It's okay.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.172
Can Superman do anything?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.480
I don't know.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.140
Keep her steady.

31:29.365 --> 31:30.540
Mom.

31:37.199 --> 31:39.680
- Is she doing okay?
- Yeah.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.082
Superman...

31:50.082 --> 31:51.822
you don't get
her out of there,

31:51.822 --> 31:53.868
she's gonna bring down
the whole block.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.654
Peia!

31:57.654 --> 32:02.355
It hurts! It hurts so much.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.797
Just concentrate
on my voice!

32:09.797 --> 32:12.017
Matteo and Bruno...

32:12.017 --> 32:16.195
I can't leave them,
not like this.

32:24.551 --> 32:27.597
It's okay, Peia!

32:27.597 --> 32:28.947
It's okay!

32:30.905 --> 32:33.864
They wouldn't want
you to suffer.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.826
It's okay to let go.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.078
- Okay, okay.
- Mom, Mom.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.391
Mom.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.829
Please don't...
please don't--

34:08.829 --> 34:11.701
She wanted me to tell you...

34:11.701 --> 34:14.704
she'll love you both...

34:14.704 --> 34:16.619
forever and always.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.799
Mom.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.601
How you feeling?

36:08.601 --> 36:12.474
Like a toy doll that's been
broken and put back together.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.217
But I'm glad it's over.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.266
I'm proud of you.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.747
Dr. Lincoln said there were
major tremors during surgery.

36:24.747 --> 36:28.229
Is everything okay?

36:28.229 --> 36:31.058
You were right about Peia.

36:31.058 --> 36:33.408
The cure didn't work.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.932
She lost control
of her powers.

36:35.932 --> 36:39.849
It was like Metropolis's
version of the big one.

36:39.849 --> 36:42.852
How did you stop her?

36:42.852 --> 36:45.899
I didn't have to.

36:45.899 --> 36:48.510
- What happened?
- Lois--

36:48.510 --> 36:51.296
What happened?

36:51.296 --> 36:55.822
In the end, I was the only
one who could get to her...

36:55.822 --> 36:58.477
so I told her
it was okay to let go.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.261
Tried to make
those last moments

37:00.261 --> 37:01.871
as easy for her as possible.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.660
I'm glad
she had you there.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.146
God, they really need
to update these things.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.800
There's so 1950s.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.541
Yeah, it's a Smallville icon
right there.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.804
Go ahead.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.719
I'll meet you in the car.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.289
Thank you
for doing this.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.160
Yeah, of course.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.555
I mean, if my mistakes can
help her even a little bit,

37:33.555 --> 37:37.429
then I guess something good
came from them.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.039
Hmm.

37:39.039 --> 37:41.737
I think you ought to take
your own advice.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.696
I'm not sure I follow.

37:43.696 --> 37:45.741
Yeah, you do.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.917
Good night, Kyle.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.927
Okay.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.538
Um...

37:59.538 --> 38:01.801
so, look, I-I've, uh...

38:01.801 --> 38:04.760
I've been working on being
a better man, you know?

38:04.760 --> 38:07.328
And--and I-I think I'm making
a lot of progress.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.330
I do.

38:09.330 --> 38:13.116
But sometimes
I'm still a jackass.

38:13.116 --> 38:15.554
And, uh...

38:15.554 --> 38:17.556
you're right.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.253
I overreacted.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.566
Well, I knew you'd figure
it out sooner or later.

38:27.566 --> 38:30.177
And you might be a jackass...

38:32.571 --> 38:34.921
But you're not an idiot.

38:37.358 --> 38:40.753
Now, how about you get
over here and make it up to me?

38:40.753 --> 38:42.581
Yes, ma'am.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.589
I think it's time we talk
about next steps

38:50.589 --> 38:52.025
for you and your son.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.029
I'll tell you everything...

38:56.029 --> 38:58.945
in exchange for Matteo's
charges being dropped.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.208
Dad, what are you doing?

39:02.862 --> 39:06.387
I'm taking responsibility
for my actions

39:06.387 --> 39:09.172
so you can live
the life you deserve.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.353
Promise me my son
will be looked after.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.270
You have my word.

39:20.270 --> 39:23.056
And I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

39:27.843 --> 39:31.543
So do we have a deal?

39:57.482 --> 39:59.484
Real white-glove
service there.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.617
Nothing
but the best for you, babe.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.106
What?

40:13.106 --> 40:15.891
You amaze me.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.851
I was unconscious.

40:18.851 --> 40:22.028
You were the one out
saving Metropolis.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.295
Seeing Peia
at the end,

40:28.295 --> 40:31.298
knowing that's what you've been
fighting this whole time...

40:33.866 --> 40:35.128
It just really hit home.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.700
I couldn't have gone through
this surgery without you.

40:43.702 --> 40:46.748
We do make
a pretty good team.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.490
Ow.

40:49.490 --> 40:52.145
You okay?

40:52.145 --> 40:54.408
Just gonna be
in pain for a while.

40:56.715 --> 40:59.152
Well, until you're better,

40:59.152 --> 41:01.720
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make sure

41:01.720 --> 41:04.549
I take the best careof you.

41:04.549 --> 41:06.464
I know.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.813
I love you.

41:07.813 --> 41:09.902
Love you, too.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.268
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
