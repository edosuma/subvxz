WEBVTT

00:12.638 --> 00:14.557
You know, it's gonna
take more than a toolbox

00:14.557 --> 00:15.808
to rebuild the Boathouse.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.184
It's a gesture, Billie.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.395
It is a
"put the past behind us,

00:19.395 --> 00:21.939
I'm part of
the solution" gesture.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.899
Have you ever even
used a toolbox before?

00:24.692 --> 00:26.110
As props.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.903
I don't know, Justin.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.614
People are really mad.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.534
Like deport you
back to Australia mad.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.952
Like there's a petition.

00:34.952 --> 00:36.620
It was an accident.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.581
It was a terrible,
horrible accident

00:38.581 --> 00:40.291
and I feel bad about it,

00:40.291 --> 00:41.959
but it's not like
I pyro-ed the place.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.627
People are gonna get over it.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.920
Good morning!

00:44.920 --> 00:46.839
Go to hell, Lovejoy!

00:46.839 --> 00:48.215
Somebody hasn't had
their coffee today.

00:53.304 --> 00:55.222
Is your mom texting you
the bus schedule again?

00:55.723 --> 00:58.058
Um, yeah. She's just
worried I'll miss it.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.518
Mm-hm.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.061
Don't think
I haven't seen you texting

01:01.061 --> 01:02.605
that cutie from
the bus all week.

01:02.605 --> 01:05.065
His name's Forrest.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.525
And we're okay with this?

01:06.525 --> 01:07.985
As in Whitaker.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.904
It's not like
his tree-planting name.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.448
All right, allowed. So dish.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.408
Height, weight, girth.
Favourite Housewives franchise.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.660
No, no, no. We are not
talking about my love life

01:16.660 --> 01:18.120
when yours is on fire.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.914
Yes, someone was
supposed to help me with that.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.875
And I tried, but Riley
just hid in his room

01:22.875 --> 01:24.668
listening to
CB radio all week.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.087
Yeah, he's trolling
for accidents.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.048
Really soothes him.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.925
Hey, will you please,

01:30.925 --> 01:33.260
please, please consider
staying an extra week?

01:33.260 --> 01:34.720
I'll even cry for your parents.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.472
Justin, me getting
this internship

01:36.472 --> 01:37.723
was a big deal for them.

01:37.723 --> 01:38.849
I can't just ditch.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.434
Plus, a job like this

01:40.434 --> 01:42.269
could really help
with scholarships next year.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.022
You don't need any help
because you're adorable like me.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.066
Go home, pyro!

01:48.317 --> 01:49.485
That could mean anything.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.370
Riley cannot join us

01:59.370 --> 02:02.581
for obvious
and humiliating reasons,

02:02.581 --> 02:04.041
but we still have enough
for quorum.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.044
So, I call to order

02:07.044 --> 02:09.463
the first Boathouse committee
meeting of the summer.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.972
First order of business,
our insurance claim.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.390
Unfortunately...

02:19.390 --> 02:22.726
I come
bearing the gift of industry.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.237
Probably gonna need
a couple of end tables

02:33.237 --> 02:35.114
to really pull
the space together, huh, guys.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.617
As I was saying, unfortunately,

02:38.617 --> 02:40.953
insurance has denied our claim.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.038
There is no money to rebuild.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.457
Denied?
How? How is that possible?

02:45.457 --> 02:47.293
Because they don't want
to foot the bill

02:47.293 --> 02:49.378
for <i>Run Lola Run</i> here.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.131
I'm sorry.
Are you all blaming me for this?

02:52.131 --> 02:53.966
Yes. Look at the place.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.594
You almost ruined everything.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.512
Fireworks went off
and the place went up.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.014
Okay, but Justin was gone

03:00.014 --> 03:01.473
- before the fire started.
- Thank you.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.267
He bolted from that altar
like he was on fire.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.852
I was in a fugue state.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.938
The Boathouse was built
before building codes.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.025
So even if our policy
wasn't violated,

03:11.025 --> 03:13.319
the payout wouldn't be
enough to rebuild.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.362
Breaks my heart to say

03:15.362 --> 03:17.907
the Boathouse is in Valhalla now

03:17.907 --> 03:20.284
until the end of days
comes again.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.721
- You don't need to do that.
- Yeah, I do.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.433
I learned to swim here, Billie.
Parents bring their kids here.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.478
Parents get hammered watching
their kids learn to swim here.

03:47.478 --> 03:49.521
God, of course
everyone hates me!

03:49.521 --> 03:52.441
Stop being dramatic.
No one hates you.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.485
We hate you, Lovejoy!

03:54.485 --> 03:58.072
And the only mess you need to
clean up, Justin, is with Riley.

03:58.072 --> 04:00.658
How? He's not even
talking to me

04:00.658 --> 04:02.201
'cause I ruined his life.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.621
Okay, now I'm being dramatic.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.539
All right, I know
where you can find him, okay?

04:07.539 --> 04:08.958
I promised
I wouldn't say anything,

04:08.958 --> 04:11.418
but he's self-soothing
at the chip truck.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.339
After carb shaming me
for a year, but no, no,

04:15.339 --> 04:17.299
Lovejoy is always the monster.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.635
- Justin!
- I know, I heard myself.

04:19.635 --> 04:20.761
I can hear myself.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.725
God, I don't even know
what I would say

04:26.725 --> 04:28.936
- even if I saw him.
- Less.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.270
Always less.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.065
Ah, shit. I can't.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.818
I've got Opal's berry picking
jamboree thing today.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.028
You're not going to apologize
to the love of your life

04:38.028 --> 04:39.905
because you have
to pick berries?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.700
Well, I can't ditch. Not if I'm
camping out on Maisy's porch.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.746
- Unless...
- Hard pass.

04:47.746 --> 04:48.998
Oh, come on, man.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.290
You said you'd help me

04:50.290 --> 04:52.876
and Opal's really, really scary.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.714
Fine. Fine.
But you owe me.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.049
Picking berries for fun sends
very confusing messages

04:59.049 --> 05:00.551
to my ancestors.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.302
Got it. Okay.

05:04.763 --> 05:06.432
Okay. I'll just, um...

05:07.683 --> 05:09.518
get a bigger bucket.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.815
- First dibs on her Percocet.
- Jesus.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.150
Why are you
in your mom's purse?

05:16.150 --> 05:18.027
I am looking for her phone.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.446
There's got to be something in
there to prove she's not dying.

05:20.446 --> 05:21.947
Why would she lie about dying?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.615
Same reason she lies
about everything.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.075
Money, attention.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.952
Unresolved
psychological issues.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.912
You always take her side.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.622
Not a word of this to Opal.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.624
I was six the first time
she pretended to have smallpox

05:32.624 --> 05:34.168
to get out of jury duty.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.045
I don't want him
riding the same trauma train.

05:36.045 --> 05:37.671
Good morning, lovelies.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.550
Mom, we're going berry
picking, not to Ascot.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.511
You only live once,
and Givenchy gives life.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.804
Twinning.

05:46.764 --> 05:48.724
<i>You're berry picking?</i>

05:48.724 --> 05:50.976
<i>Is this another protest
for migrant workers?</i>

05:50.976 --> 05:53.729
It's Opal's jamboree today,
so I'm subbing for Justin

05:53.729 --> 05:55.856
so he can patch things up
with Riley and, I don't know,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.691
I just wish there was
something more I could do.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.942
<i>Uh-uh. Justin's relationship</i>

05:58.942 --> 06:00.569
<i>is not your responsibility.</i>

06:00.569 --> 06:03.238
<i>You are the child. You.</i>

06:03.238 --> 06:04.114
<i>Now...</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:08.744
<i>look what I picked out
for your first day.</i>

06:08.744 --> 06:10.746
That's not really my style, Mom.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.999
<i>This internship is about
your future, not your style.</i>

06:13.999 --> 06:16.001
Yeah, but has my future stalled

06:16.001 --> 06:17.836
at mid-level management
and three cats?

06:17.836 --> 06:19.922
<i>I think it's very chic
and it won't wash you out.</i>

06:19.922 --> 06:21.924
<i>Have fun on your last day, baby.</i>

06:21.924 --> 06:23.342
<i>I've resent the bus schedule</i>

06:23.342 --> 06:24.802
<i>because your future
won't wait...</i>

06:26.303 --> 06:27.638
Mom?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.683
Oh, shit.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.066
Where am I?

06:42.236 --> 06:45.572
<i>♪ Clovers ♪</i>

06:45.572 --> 06:48.450
Who ordered this
fine day, huh? Whoo!

06:53.247 --> 06:55.791
Hey, thanks for
letting me tag along.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.585
I got too much time on my hands
when Jaynie's got the kids.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.419
Hm.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.132
Everything okay, bud?

07:03.132 --> 07:05.509
Great. 110%.

07:08.137 --> 07:09.471
What are you doing?

07:09.471 --> 07:11.515
I'm holding some space
for your feelings.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.516
Please stop.

07:12.516 --> 07:14.268
No, I will not.

07:14.268 --> 07:17.229
Tell you what, I'll stop
after you share with me

07:17.229 --> 07:18.772
what's going on inside you.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.066
Not a big deal. I just...

07:21.066 --> 07:23.193
didn't get
a new tattoo this year.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.653
Ah. Nipple piercing?

07:24.653 --> 07:26.989
No, drew a blank.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.826
Wayne, my tats are my yearbook
of how awesome my life's been.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.705
Killian's birth, Opal's
first haiku, seeing the yeti.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.456
Oh, cool. Nice.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.334
But this year,
what's to ink about?

07:39.334 --> 07:42.421
Career's done, Killian's gone.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.923
Opal only wants me
as a chauffeur

07:44.923 --> 07:47.217
and we lost the cottage.

07:47.217 --> 07:51.138
Hey, I felt the same way
after me and Jaynie splitskied.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.057
I had to reconnect with
who I was before marriage,

07:54.057 --> 07:56.560
before the girls and Olive.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.521
- You go into therapy?
- Bingo. Yeah.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.232
Got the Headspace app,
took a few quizzes on BuzzFeed.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.359
Boom.
Brand new Wayner, bud.

08:04.359 --> 08:07.905
So, tell me,
who was little Victor, huh?

08:07.905 --> 08:11.158
Like, before Maisy,
before the kids, you know?

08:11.158 --> 08:14.703
Before your middling career,
what did Victor love?

08:16.330 --> 08:20.751
Ice hockey, ball hockey,
field hockey, air hockey.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.670
Before hockey, okay?
Go way back.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.380
All right,
if we're going to progress,

08:25.380 --> 08:27.257
we must regress, <i>compadre.</i>

08:27.257 --> 08:29.760
And you know, that starts
with a poking stick.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.262
Not where I thought
you were going with that.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.348
We can't wait
for Billie anymore.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.227
People, I'm only going
to say this once.

08:38.227 --> 08:41.521
I want firm, ripe berries
the size of my thumb.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.232
I don't care
if your fingers are bleeding,

08:43.232 --> 08:46.068
colour and viscosity are key
to a proper coulis.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.574
Are you sure
you're up for this?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.284
I don't want you
to push yourself.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.370
I think your feeble
old mother

08:56.370 --> 08:58.080
could manage
a berry on a bush.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.918
Oh, dear. Is this necessary?

09:02.918 --> 09:05.254
How many more hugs
do we have left?

09:05.254 --> 09:08.090
Yes, well,
always leave them wanting more.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.137
But it's sweet of you to worry?

09:14.972 --> 09:17.015
Yes, let's go with that.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.321
Hi.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.490
Hey, you don't have
to accept my apology.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.450
But will you at least give me
a chance to make it?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.082
Two minutes?
I like my curds...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.292
- Squeaky.
- Squeaky.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.294
I know.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.172
Peace offering?

09:56.013 --> 09:57.014
It's cute, right?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.142
For Rile-E Coyote.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.567
I don't work
with animals anymore.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.527
I'm doing a series
on hit and runs.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.571
Why cowards flee the scene.

10:12.571 --> 10:13.613
Topical.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.782
Maybe you could shed some light.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.243
I don't know. I don't know,
Riley. I don't know.

10:18.243 --> 10:22.331
I panicked. It was
the proposal, the wedding.

10:22.331 --> 10:24.666
It was swoony.
It was all so swoony,

10:24.666 --> 10:26.626
but that doesn't mean
that it wasn't crazy.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.129
Wanting to spend my life
with you is crazy.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.882
No, no. We were taking
our wedding vows

10:31.882 --> 10:34.217
in front of Maisy,
my stepmother,

10:34.217 --> 10:35.927
and a bunch
of dead animals, Riley.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.554
Billie was there.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.848
Yes, and so worried,
but trying to play it cool.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.475
And I didn't want
to let her down again

10:41.475 --> 10:43.226
because I just got
my life together.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.730
Some would say getting married
is getting your life together.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.648
And 50% of them
end in bitterness, resentment,

10:48.648 --> 10:50.567
and shared custody
of a Pomeranian,

10:50.567 --> 10:52.611
but at least they have
a Vitamix to show for it.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.238
You ran 'cause you wanted gifts?

10:55.238 --> 10:57.741
Yes, of course I wanted gifts.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.452
That is
the lamest excuse.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.329
Excuse?

11:02.329 --> 11:06.166
The man I love
deserves kitchen appliances,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.584
a 12-piece place setting,

11:07.584 --> 11:10.170
and at least
one cashmere throw.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.756
I'll tell you
what I deserve.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.424
Good.
Tell me what you deserve.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.390
- My truck. Now.
- Okay, I'm right behind you.

11:24.101 --> 11:28.438
What's your passcode, Mother?
Your birthday?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.234
My birthday.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.655
Victor's birthday?

11:37.239 --> 11:38.448
Oh.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.039
Mom.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.916
Why do you have
Nana's phone?

11:48.917 --> 11:50.293
Uh...

11:56.967 --> 11:59.845
Hello? Hello!

12:01.430 --> 12:03.765
Ah. Okay.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.485
Oh, thank God!
Thank God, thank God!

12:15.485 --> 12:17.320
Hi. Hi.
My name is Billie Barnes.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.531
I'm 17 years old
and I've been missing for hours.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.450
And I have no water, no signal.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.702
Please radio my parents
and tell them I'm alive.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.287
You can send a flare
for the helicopter.

12:25.287 --> 12:27.747
Uh, I'm not a forest ranger.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.875
Oh, no.
What are we going to do?

12:29.875 --> 12:32.836
Uh, you're going to sit down
and drink some water.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.713
You're dehydrated.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.465
We don't sit on the grass
in my family.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.008
Okay? Tick, tick, boom.
Lyme disease.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.302
Grass isn't
long enough for ticks.

12:40.886 --> 12:43.221
Okay. There you go.

12:46.641 --> 12:50.061
Uh, I'm Ivy. I was planting
trees nearby when I heard you.

12:50.061 --> 12:54.483
Planting trees? Oh, God.
Did I walk all the way to BC?

12:55.484 --> 12:57.527
Small sips or you'll cramp.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.570
Exactly.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.549
That was the best makeup sex
we've ever had.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
Because that was breakup sex.

13:24.930 --> 13:30.018
What? Hey, Riley,
we can fix this.

13:30.018 --> 13:33.146
Riley, we can fix this.
I can fix this.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.777
You know, shit never works out
between cottagers and townies.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.530
You know, you guys,
you come for a season

13:41.530 --> 13:42.781
and you leave for no reason.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.241
It's called fall.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.117
You're not going
to be the one

13:46.117 --> 13:48.703
who has to deal with, "Your ex
burnt down the Boathouse,"

13:48.703 --> 13:50.372
for the rest of his life.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.124
All right? One,
I didn't torch the Boathouse.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.001
Two, I sublet my apartment.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.462
Riley, I don't have any place
to go until October.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.964
You're not hearing me,
all right?

13:58.964 --> 14:02.008
That Boathouse meant
a lot to people around here.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.094
- My great-grandfather...
- I know!

14:04.094 --> 14:06.304
Your great-grandfather was one
of the original carpenters.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.473
Did he build
that cross you're on too?

14:09.432 --> 14:10.642
Get out.

14:11.643 --> 14:13.353
All right, make me.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.856
Get out.

14:18.733 --> 14:19.776
Make me.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.071
Fine.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.077
Come on!

14:34.958 --> 14:40.046
Those feelings of shame will
blossom into love! You'll see!

14:42.632 --> 14:43.842
Honey.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.095
We always tell each other
the truth, right?

14:47.095 --> 14:49.347
Ever since you came home
with a pixie cut.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.225
Sorry you had to see that.
I want you to know

14:52.225 --> 14:54.019
that the reason that
I took Nana's phone is...

14:54.019 --> 14:55.687
Is because you can't accept
she's dying.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.147
She told you?

14:58.106 --> 15:00.108
That's why this berry cull
is so important.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.069
Berries are rich in antioxidants
and fight free radicals.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.780
Ironic as
Nana's free and radical.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.115
Madness to attack
one of their own.

15:08.408 --> 15:12.454
Nana doesn't always
tell the truth like we do.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.128
I know you miss Killian,
but you can't be mad at Nana

15:20.128 --> 15:21.796
for helping him
find his light.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.840
You both struggle
being in our shadow.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.305
Stop it.

15:31.139 --> 15:32.223
Okay.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.851
Stop it!

15:39.773 --> 15:41.149
You've left me no choice.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.235
Oh, how dare you.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.072
No, no.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.497
Now what?

15:56.289 --> 15:58.124
Poke it again, bud.

16:01.378 --> 16:02.962
Gross.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.966
Huh? How's it feel to step
outside that old coconut, huh?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.051
Feels...

16:09.344 --> 16:11.638
- Feels pretty good.
- Yeah, I bet. Yeah.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.849
So tell me, what does
little Victor love, huh?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.476
Still hockey.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.977
- Still hockey, okay.
- Yeah.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.938
Tell you what.
You keep poking that frog,

16:19.938 --> 16:22.440
I'll keep whipping these rocks
at these pine cones.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.902
Maybe one of them bonk you right
on that sexy noggin of yours.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.238
You'll have a light bulb moment,
just like Sir Fig Newton.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.406
- Wayne.
- What?

16:29.406 --> 16:30.782
That's not a pine cone.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.620
Run.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.414
- Run, Victor!
- Run, Wayne!

16:37.414 --> 16:38.915
Oh, my God.
They're in my shorts.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.875
They're in my shorts!

16:40.875 --> 16:42.711
Don't talk!
They'll go in your mouth!

16:44.546 --> 16:47.257
- How you feeling?
- Better, thanks.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.300
Next time you go wandering alone
in the woods,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.094
- maybe bring a compass.
- Yeah.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.388
You know, I thought that
someone voted most likely

16:53.388 --> 16:55.598
to be the next
Greta Thunberg would have known.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.642
Most people who are
into the environment

16:57.642 --> 16:59.269
don't go into the environment.

16:59.978 --> 17:03.106
Don't sweat it.
But if you do, it's a good sign

17:03.773 --> 17:05.191
because you're dehydrated.

17:05.859 --> 17:09.529
I got it.
Love a dry sense of humor.

17:10.238 --> 17:13.324
- Because I'm dehydrated.
- I got it.

17:13.783 --> 17:16.119
And just so you know,
I'm not like one of those girls

17:16.119 --> 17:18.329
who stages a walk out
over plastic straws

17:18.329 --> 17:19.873
to get out of class.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.332
I'm actually interning at

17:21.332 --> 17:23.001
the National Climate Institute
this summer.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.252
NCI?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.671
That's pretty major.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.214
Writing corporate tweets
for minimum wage

17:28.214 --> 17:29.674
all summer
would drive me nuts,

17:29.674 --> 17:31.551
but I guess
that's why I plant trees.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.012
You make bank
and a real impact.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.930
NCI makes a real impact.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.057
You push the paper,
I'll plant it.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.770
Yeah, and I'll push it
right into the recycling bin

17:41.770 --> 17:43.688
and, uh,
you know, save you some...

17:43.688 --> 17:45.315
- Easy, Thunberg.
- ...trees to plant.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.649
Drink more water.

17:47.859 --> 17:50.153
Oh, shit. Sit tight
while I grab some more.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.238
- My piece isn't far.
- Okay.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.365
Thanks.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.549
- Ulrika!
- Ugh! Holy crap!

18:13.009 --> 18:14.928
Must your pitch be so sharp?

18:14.928 --> 18:16.471
Gay voice. Confuses predators.

18:16.471 --> 18:17.931
I want to help rebuild
the Boathouse.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.432
- Oh.
- I know people blame me.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.683
- Justin
- Ulrika,

18:20.683 --> 18:21.976
I'm a part of this
community too.

18:21.976 --> 18:24.187
Justin.
I wish I could help.

18:24.187 --> 18:27.649
Not true.
But even if it was, it's not,

18:27.649 --> 18:29.734
I am no longer
the Boathouse president.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.277
What do you mean? Why?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.947
Swedes have a tradition. Walpurgis.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.033
A fire is lit to welcome spring
and the changes it brings.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.953
The Boathouse
burning was a sign.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.454
To what? To quit?

18:41.454 --> 18:43.039
What are we going
to do about the Boathouse?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.583
Please ask
the new president about it.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.961
Ulrika, I found your Matterhorn.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.630
That is
a Swedish cow horn.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.923
The Matterhorn is Swiss.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.176
Madam President.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.803
Ooh! Girl's finally
in the driver's seat.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.179
Wow!

18:58.179 --> 19:00.014
She's a little crispy,

19:00.014 --> 19:01.933
but we'll rise from the ashes
like Dumbledore's canary.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.309
All right, listen.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.895
I have got
some great fundraising ideas.

19:05.895 --> 19:08.022
I've got a little bit of savings
and I have this, um,

19:08.022 --> 19:09.482
this new colour palette
I'd love to pitch.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.901
Okay, slow down,
Mrs. Housefire.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.570
Even if we had the money,

19:13.570 --> 19:16.322
you are going nowhere near
a Boathouse rebuild.

19:16.322 --> 19:20.201
Your pyro romantic wedding décor
is why our claim was denied.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.537
I told you to take
the fireworks outside.

19:22.537 --> 19:25.081
Them going off inside
violated the policy.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.375
I did. I did take them outside.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.128
Ooh, well then, why did
they go off inside, bridezilla?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.547
I don't know.
And that's a horrible moniker.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.716
Well, let insurance know
when you do.

19:34.716 --> 19:38.011
In the meantime, all Boathouse
activities will happen at mine.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.555
The Boathouse will
not go down on my watch.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.182
Jayne Payne delivers again.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.103
As long as the beach
stays clothing optional.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.230
We'll revisit that.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.607
Suppose it makes sense.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.442
No, none of this makes sense.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.613
Can you play
"Winner Takes It All"?

19:56.613 --> 19:58.615
Or do you hate
Swiss music, too?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.742
Give me that.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.954
Billie. Billie.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.375
Victor?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.085
Oh...

20:11.085 --> 20:14.339
Easy, sunstroke.
You okay?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.841
Yeah, but did you see a girl

20:16.841 --> 20:18.843
my height,
Black, kind of judgey?

20:18.843 --> 20:22.096
Sun really cooked your noodle.
You just described yourself.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.099
Can I get your advice
on something?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.935
Shouldn't you ask
Justin about that kind of stuff?

20:26.935 --> 20:30.063
- When has that ever helped?
- True dat. Lay it on me.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.230
Okay.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.566
Did you always
want to play hockey?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.443
Or did your parents
just want you to play hockey?

20:35.443 --> 20:37.320
And did you actually like
playing hockey?

20:37.320 --> 20:39.447
Or did you just like that your
parents liked you liking hockey?

20:39.447 --> 20:41.407
Uh, all of the above.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.743
Hey, but I know a frog
we could ask.

20:44.619 --> 20:45.954
Good news.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.163
Hey, it's Wayne-ie the Pooh.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.873
Got away from the wasps.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.667
Bad news, they moved
into my shorts, but...

20:56.673 --> 20:58.091
I'm probably
going to call it a day

20:58.091 --> 20:59.300
because it's getting late.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.136
- Wow.
- Oh.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.066
Sorry about
your berries, honey.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.527
We should have just gone
to the farmers' market.

21:23.658 --> 21:25.827
You really are a monster.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.204
Is this because
Victor's birthday is my password

21:28.204 --> 21:29.998
or you're not
on our group chat?

21:30.748 --> 21:32.750
If you're going to take
someone's phone

21:32.750 --> 21:34.210
for what's
none of your business,

21:34.210 --> 21:35.628
you better be able
to take your lumps

21:35.628 --> 21:36.921
when the answers
aren't to your liking.

21:36.921 --> 21:38.923
I know you are not dying.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.009
You booked a trip
to Bora Bora for next year.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.885
Well, I wasn't going
to die here, was I?

21:42.885 --> 21:45.430
If you really are sick,
then let me talk to your doctor.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.765
No. I will not allow

21:47.765 --> 21:49.976
what's left of my life
to be about my illness.

21:49.976 --> 21:53.021
- But your illness is...
- Is not my identity.

21:53.021 --> 21:53.896
My looks are.

21:53.896 --> 21:54.981
Ugh.

21:57.859 --> 21:59.819
I know that in the past

21:59.819 --> 22:02.822
I have taken certain creative
liberties with my health

22:02.822 --> 22:04.574
to better our situation.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.201
Like pretending your kidneys
were failing in Marrakesh

22:07.201 --> 22:08.870
so you could get bumped up
to first class?

22:08.870 --> 22:10.204
You remember?

22:10.204 --> 22:12.165
I remember
you left me in coach.

22:12.165 --> 22:14.500
You were never going to
experience local culture

22:14.500 --> 22:16.586
if you didn't
travel with the locals.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.423
But my diagnosis is real.

22:20.423 --> 22:22.759
So to prove that,

22:22.759 --> 22:24.719
I will sign over
Derrick's cottage

22:24.719 --> 22:26.095
at the end of this summer.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.766
If you really want to prove it,
then sign it over right now.

22:29.766 --> 22:33.770
No. I need a little leverage
so that you'll stay the summer.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.147
That way I can spend
the strength that I have

22:36.147 --> 22:38.524
on the people I love,
in the place they adore.

22:41.778 --> 22:44.113
Very nice phone lift,
by the way.

22:44.947 --> 22:47.241
Traveling with
the locals pays off.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.913
Don't forget to
clean up for dinner.

22:57.460 --> 23:01.714
I know I put it right here.
Where the hell is it?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.467
- You suck, Lovejoy!
- I'm aware. Thank you.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.142
What the hell?

23:19.357 --> 23:21.567
Who in the hell?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.196
Telling you, Maizers.
Wayne just changed my life.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.697
That makes me nervous.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.366
I've been kind of lost
since hockey's done.

23:28.366 --> 23:29.700
It's just the concussions, hun.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.160
But Wayne got me out of my head.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.620
I've been thinking too much.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.664
- Never been an issue.
- You too, babe.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.415
Your mom
is giving you the cottage.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.584
We don't need to look
for a new one. Let's enjoy it.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.087
She is only giving it back to us
to stop us from figuring out

23:41.087 --> 23:43.089
whatever scam
has got her playing sick.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.091
She only spends time with us
when she wants something.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.843
Maybe she wants
to hang out with us.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.470
Not likely. Unless it's to catch
you coming out of the shower.

23:49.470 --> 23:51.139
If she's going to give us
the cottage back

23:51.139 --> 23:52.306
by the end of the summer,

23:52.306 --> 23:53.933
we have got to make it
a short one.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.227
- You promise not to kill her?
- Which I regret,

23:56.227 --> 23:58.646
but we are still
going to call her bluff.

23:58.646 --> 24:01.065
First, I'm going to get her
to sign over the cottage to us

24:01.065 --> 24:03.234
and then I'm going
to make her summer so awful

24:03.234 --> 24:05.528
she suddenly finds
a miracle cure in the Andes.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.946
I don't think I like this.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.823
I thought you
were done thinking.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.032
Damn it.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.745
Hey, what's going on?
Where are we?

24:14.745 --> 24:16.372
Why are we paddling
all the way out here?

24:16.372 --> 24:18.124
Well, I want
to show you something

24:18.124 --> 24:20.251
because I have
huge news, Justin.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.170
- Like, huge.
- Well, brace yourself

24:22.170 --> 24:24.297
because I have got
even huger news.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.507
- I'll go first.
- Or we could flip for it.

24:26.507 --> 24:27.925
I'm quitting my internship

24:27.925 --> 24:29.427
to be a tree planter
for the summer.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.845
Okay. Tree planting.

24:30.845 --> 24:32.305
Great.
Thrilled that you're staying.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.764
A little concerned,
a little confused.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.475
Many follow up questions,
but first, my thing.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.311
Well, you held out
longer than I thought.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.521
I think someone really
did burn down the Boathouse.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.356
And if I can find out who,

24:42.356 --> 24:44.442
then I can get the insurance
money back to rebuild it.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.403
Then maybe Riley and the rest
of the lake will forgive me.

24:47.403 --> 24:49.655
Okay, confused.

24:49.655 --> 24:52.366
Kind of concerned,
many follow up questions.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.702
But first, my thing.

24:58.831 --> 25:02.168
