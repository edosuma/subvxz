WEBVTT

01:11.000 --> 01:13.389
<i>Late February</i>

01:14.836 --> 01:19.751
What do you think the unconscious is
in a psychological sense?

01:27.136 --> 01:28.285
Well?

01:30.931 --> 01:32.728
Someone unaware of their actions

01:33.015 --> 01:35.893
Not knowing the consequences
of their actions?

01:36.726 --> 01:39.445
I meant in a psychological sense

01:43.439 --> 01:45.395
It's like someone in a coma

01:48.025 --> 01:49.697
You're surpassing yourself

01:51.486 --> 01:52.999
You look tired

01:56.198 --> 01:59.190
Any other ideas? We only have
ten minutes

02:06.454 --> 02:07.807
Miss Tessier

02:08.498 --> 02:12.377
Mathilde. I don't like being called
by my surname

02:12.751 --> 02:14.264
You're 45 minutes late

02:14.543 --> 02:20.220
And If I'm right, you've missed maths.
Still, you're more punctual than usual

02:21.339 --> 02:24.968
When did you last attend my class?

02:36.725 --> 02:40.604
Over two weeks ago. Seventeen days...

02:41.603 --> 02:43.195
...to be precise

02:44.648 --> 02:48.004
You could wait for my permission
to sit down

02:50.151 --> 02:51.630
You don't apologise...

02:51.902 --> 02:53.130
...for being late

02:53.403 --> 02:56.395
You just tell me not to call you
Tessier

02:57.323 --> 03:00.713
What does the unconscious mean to you?
Carpentier?

03:01.367 --> 03:03.244
- She's just arrived
- True

03:03.535 --> 03:08.814
But do you think Miss Te...
Sorry, Mathilde

03:09.997 --> 03:13.148
Do you think Mathilde could answer...

03:13.500 --> 03:15.570
...if she'd been on time?

03:15.877 --> 03:17.435
It's not her fault

03:19.921 --> 03:21.240
So, Mathilde

03:21.506 --> 03:26.182
What terrible disaster justifies your
being late and missing so many classes

03:28.761 --> 03:34.040
Get out. And don't come back
until you know the answer

03:36.683 --> 03:38.082
Write this down...

03:41.895 --> 03:44.728
Before our next class...

03:47.941 --> 03:50.899
...please find out how the classics...

03:52.110 --> 03:56.547
...then Bergson and later Freud...

03:57.697 --> 03:59.494
...defined the unconscious

04:33.596 --> 04:34.995
She's so pale

04:35.849 --> 04:39.080
- What's wrong?
- She was crying and then she fainted

04:39.434 --> 04:42.949
- Shall we call the police?
- No, leave it to me

04:43.603 --> 04:45.480
Are you a teacher?

04:45.772 --> 04:46.761
Don't worry

04:48.023 --> 04:50.173
I'm not worried

04:51.943 --> 04:56.255
- I'll take you back to school
- No, back home

04:57.488 --> 04:59.001
Where's that?

05:00.156 --> 05:02.112
I'll show you

05:03.701 --> 05:05.498
Can you get up?

06:23.422 --> 06:25.219
Do you have a doctor?

06:26.049 --> 06:28.324
I just need some sleep

06:33.304 --> 06:35.101
I can't just leave you

06:42.060 --> 06:44.858
I'll come back later, after the class

06:45.520 --> 06:46.635
Keys...

06:46.896 --> 06:49.171
...in my pocket. Lock the door

06:54.235 --> 06:56.032
Do you need anything?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.506
- So?
- Doctor's appointment

07:19.794 --> 07:23.025
- Where's your certificate?
- I don't have it

07:23.379 --> 07:24.812
Headmaster's office

07:25.048 --> 07:27.198
- How are you?
- And you?

07:27.507 --> 07:30.419
- Do you have Tessier's file?
- More problems?

07:30.760 --> 07:32.352
No, it's my fault

07:41.017 --> 07:43.485
- How old is she?
- 17

07:44.727 --> 07:45.716
Parents?

07:45.979 --> 07:49.688
They live and work in Paris.
She has two brothers

07:50.064 --> 07:53.056
She came to us in January last year

07:54.609 --> 07:59.478
- Didn't her Paris school send her file
- No, I asked them twice

08:01.364 --> 08:02.843
<i>Never attends classes</i>

08:03.115 --> 08:06.824
- Why did she move here?
- She's very secretive

08:08.160 --> 08:10.799
Has she no family here?

08:11.328 --> 08:14.957
- She lives alone?
- Without family anyway

08:16.916 --> 08:20.067
How did she end up in the sixth form
with this file?

08:20.418 --> 08:23.171
Thanks to Fleurier, her French teacher

08:23.671 --> 08:25.866
The others were furious

08:26.172 --> 08:31.644
The students' representatives and
a couple of teachers won the vote

08:32.093 --> 08:37.087
<i>Mathilde is gifted but fragile
Her dad is neglectful her mum suicidal</i>

08:37.513 --> 08:42.906
<i>Her brothers have been in trouble
with the police What can we do?</i>

08:43.350 --> 08:47.821
<i>Her problems are out of our control
Jacques Fleurier</i>

08:48.854 --> 08:50.845
What happened to Fleurier?

08:51.148 --> 08:56.097
A breakdown. The department agreed
to a quick transfer

08:59.696 --> 09:03.484
- What do you think of her?
- She's quite a character

09:04.198 --> 09:07.190
Are you interested in her? Be careful

09:07.534 --> 09:09.331
Why do you say that?

09:09.660 --> 09:13.972
- Can I keep this?
- Yes, but the Head needs it tomorrow

09:35.761 --> 09:37.399
<i>Doctor's surgery</i>

09:37.680 --> 09:40.592
This is Fran�ois Hainaut. Is doctor...

09:44.559 --> 09:47.027
Really, there's no need

09:49.271 --> 09:52.581
Take your coat off and sit down

09:52.940 --> 09:54.453
Are you feeling better?

09:55.066 --> 09:58.581
Thanks for looking after me.
I hadn't slept

10:06.199 --> 10:09.714
I'm sorry I made you cry this morning

10:10.744 --> 10:15.295
It wasn't you. It happens when I think
about my life

10:43.975 --> 10:44.964
Don't go

10:45.225 --> 10:46.374
I'm expected

10:46.644 --> 10:47.838
Please

10:48.978 --> 10:53.972
I'm afraid to be on my own now.
Don't you ever need to talk to someone

10:57.359 --> 10:59.429
You won't go, will you?

11:05.364 --> 11:07.002
That's my file

11:07.658 --> 11:09.376
I'm intrigued by you

11:09.659 --> 11:11.615
That means I exist

11:16.121 --> 11:18.555
Why did you leave Paris?

11:19.749 --> 11:20.943
Well?

11:21.750 --> 11:23.024
My mother...

11:24.336 --> 11:27.169
I was sick of visiting her
in hospital...

11:27.504 --> 11:29.972
...every time her new lover left her

11:30.798 --> 11:32.834
What was wrong with her?

11:33.301 --> 11:35.451
She kept trying to kill herself

11:35.760 --> 11:41.915
My father could either leave me here
in St-Etienne or with mum. So here I am

11:42.389 --> 11:46.382
- Couldn't he find somewhere closer?
- You don't know her

11:48.393 --> 11:50.384
Your father is a doctor?

11:50.687 --> 11:54.805
A psychiatrist. I'm a child
of the failed revolution

11:55.190 --> 11:59.388
In '68, the proletariat disappointed
my parents. So what did they turn to?

11:59.777 --> 12:04.487
Hindu philosophy. The world, life,
everything is but an illusion

12:04.906 --> 12:08.945
As a philosophy teacher,
you must know all about it

12:09.324 --> 12:14.114
So dad stopped caring about everything
that bothered him, like us

12:14.536 --> 12:17.812
My mother became so detached
from things...

12:18.164 --> 12:20.632
...she sees her 'god' every two months

12:21.792 --> 12:26.661
Joking aside, he's OK.
But she's a madwoman and a bitch

12:27.087 --> 12:29.078
That's a contradiction in terms

12:30.172 --> 12:31.764
Not with her

12:33.300 --> 12:34.699
And your brothers?

12:34.967 --> 12:37.561
How many times a month do you screw?

12:38.678 --> 12:40.748
Or should I say a year?

12:44.474 --> 12:46.465
- Forgive me
- Why?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.091
You can ask questions too

12:51.562 --> 12:53.359
What does your wife do?

12:53.647 --> 12:59.165
She manages her own bookshop. She also
writes articles for the regional paper

12:59.609 --> 13:01.201
She loves you?

13:02.361 --> 13:04.317
- Of course
- Don't fib

13:04.613 --> 13:06.046
I know many couples

13:31.381 --> 13:33.451
Let me take you to dinner

13:34.466 --> 13:35.899
I'm expected

13:38.802 --> 13:40.281
Call them

13:46.600 --> 13:49.478
Don't worry. I've no tears left to cry

13:49.810 --> 13:53.405
You've been kind to me.
It's been rare lately

14:02.319 --> 14:07.757
<i>You've reached Catherine and Fran�ois
Hainaut Please leave a message</i>

14:09.240 --> 14:11.515
Catherine, I'll be home late

14:11.825 --> 14:13.543
Don't worry

14:13.827 --> 14:15.101
Love you

14:21.832 --> 14:22.947
Let's go

14:23.917 --> 14:25.236
Why resent...

14:25.501 --> 14:26.570
...your parents?

14:26.918 --> 14:31.355
We're all children and it's hard
when our illusions are shattered

14:31.755 --> 14:34.713
They made me. I didn't ask them

14:36.675 --> 14:39.189
It's not easy having children

14:41.095 --> 14:43.211
Is that why you haven't?

14:43.681 --> 14:47.151
You've ruined your schooling enough

14:47.683 --> 14:50.641
Please try to put your problems
aside...

14:50.977 --> 14:52.410
...and study

14:52.686 --> 14:57.521
What for? You're born, you rush around
and then you die

14:58.106 --> 15:02.896
Culture and diplomas would help you
rush around better and more pleasantly

15:03.318 --> 15:06.116
- You believe that?
- That's why I teach

15:06.613 --> 15:11.084
Life is so much richer
than you could ever expect

15:12.575 --> 15:14.645
Despair is a form of vanity...

15:14.951 --> 15:16.100
...in disguise

15:16.369 --> 15:21.568
I don't know if it's a form of vanity,
but when you catch it, it really hurts

15:29.253 --> 15:30.811
You're young

15:31.547 --> 15:34.823
Learn to approach life
with an open mind

15:38.384 --> 15:40.693
Keep your money. You hardly ate

15:42.262 --> 15:46.221
I've never eaten much
and you intimidate me

16:13.533 --> 16:15.046
I like you

16:16.452 --> 16:19.012
Because you're like me. Alone

16:19.329 --> 16:24.039
Why do you say that? I have a wife,
friends, students...

16:25.458 --> 16:28.734
What about you? Don't you have
a boyfriend?

16:30.754 --> 16:34.144
Why see someone I won't even remember
in ten years' time?

16:34.797 --> 16:38.676
And the spectacle of others' illusions
make me lose my own

16:39.384 --> 16:41.739
What do you mean by that?

16:42.136 --> 16:44.252
Isn't it clear enough?

16:45.681 --> 16:47.717
You're an unusual person

16:49.266 --> 16:54.340
It's rare to see a girl your age
who's so disillusioned

16:55.770 --> 16:57.761
I was going to say so lucid

17:18.161 --> 17:23.394
Please don't miss any more classes,
study and you'll pass your exams

17:23.831 --> 17:25.150
If you like

17:25.416 --> 17:29.568
- It would be silly to ruin your life
- Won't you come in?

17:36.298 --> 17:38.334
Thank you for helping me

17:38.800 --> 17:41.394
Be early. I set some homework

18:10.655 --> 18:12.213
<i>Hi it's Catherine</i>

18:12.490 --> 18:17.405
<i>I've come across some fascinating
books in Tours I'm checking them out</i>

18:17.827 --> 18:22.617
<i>Then I've an article to write
I'll stay in a hotel I love you</i>

19:10.529 --> 19:12.247
I was missing you

19:13.489 --> 19:18.279
- What about your article?
- Wake me up early tomorrow

19:55.226 --> 19:57.456
- Class A3?
- Yes

20:05.066 --> 20:08.581
<i>Meeting at 3pm to discuss
Miss Tessier</i>

20:25.330 --> 20:28.845
Sorry, the maths teacher kept me.
May I stay?

20:40.257 --> 20:42.327
What about the unconscious?

20:43.009 --> 20:45.284
Have you thought about it?

20:48.095 --> 20:51.531
I feel Briseville has something to say

20:52.849 --> 20:54.840
Still in a coma?

20:57.727 --> 20:59.001
Anyone else?

21:06.984 --> 21:11.899
For the classics and Bergson,
the unconscious doesn't exist

21:12.321 --> 21:16.997
It's the sum of buried memories
you can retrieve if you try

21:17.408 --> 21:22.721
I only find Racine interesting. Once
struck by passion, his characters...

21:23.161 --> 21:28.679
...are dominated and manipulated
by forces, as if possessed

21:29.124 --> 21:34.801
These forces come from God, but are
the same as in the Freudian unconscious

21:35.670 --> 21:39.265
Miss Mathilde, take my place

21:46.302 --> 21:49.180
In the late 19th century, there's Freud

21:49.513 --> 21:54.109
He defined the unconscious based on
his medical experience

21:54.516 --> 21:59.306
The unconscious is the sum
of all the subject's repressed memories...

21:59.728 --> 22:02.401
...which sometimes reappear as symptom

22:02.730 --> 22:08.805
We're all ruled by forces we're totally
unaware of, as in 'fate neuroses'

22:09.235 --> 22:10.224
Meaning?

22:10.444 --> 22:12.958
Some people are prisoners
of their fate...

22:13.279 --> 22:18.228
...always blighted by the same dramas.
It's like they're victims of fate

22:18.657 --> 22:22.013
For psychoanalysts, they're prisoners
of their unconscious

22:22.368 --> 22:24.404
What is psychoanalysis?

22:27.038 --> 22:32.158
Freud tried to treat patients suffering
conditions which had no physical cause

22:32.584 --> 22:34.381
They were in fact prisoners...

22:34.668 --> 22:40.698
...of repressed, therefore unconscious
ideas and desires which Freud unlocked

22:41.173 --> 22:45.963
Finally conscious of his traumatic
memories, the patient discusses them...

22:46.385 --> 22:48.182
...and the symptoms vanish

22:48.470 --> 22:50.506
Does it always work?

23:08.900 --> 23:13.769
I'll give you the subject
of your next essay tomorrow

23:17.323 --> 23:18.722
A word, please

23:21.409 --> 23:25.402
You were fantastic. Can you explain
the difference...

23:32.166 --> 23:35.158
- You were outstanding
- My dad is a psychiatrist

23:35.502 --> 23:38.733
Maybe, but you've grasped
the subject perfectly

23:40.505 --> 23:43.019
I need a word with your classmate

23:44.633 --> 23:47.227
We're meeting to discuss your case

23:47.551 --> 23:51.260
- The maths teacher wants me expelled
- Not just her

23:51.930 --> 23:55.047
- I've not seen a single essay
- Are you going?

23:55.391 --> 23:57.268
Yes, at 3 o'clock

23:58.267 --> 24:00.098
Will you still be here?

24:00.394 --> 24:05.468
No, but you can call me to let me know
Come to my place if you like

24:07.399 --> 24:09.913
Will you promise to work hard?

24:10.526 --> 24:12.357
For you, I'll do it

24:14.403 --> 24:16.041
For me?

24:37.503 --> 24:40.893
I'll bring you that file
in half an hour

24:47.175 --> 24:49.735
What shall we do with her?

24:50.511 --> 24:54.902
We have to give this girl
one last chance

24:56.474 --> 24:58.032
I'm counting on you

25:06.689 --> 25:10.238
<i>- Let's give her one more chance
- No way</i>

25:10.609 --> 25:15.205
<i>In English she hasn't said a word
all year</i>

25:16.196 --> 25:21.395
<i>- Same thing for History and Geography
- I never see her either</i>

25:29.412 --> 25:31.801
They give you until Easter

25:33.290 --> 25:36.680
I stuck my neck out. I'll help you

25:38.377 --> 25:43.371
- Are you hopeless at English?
- I've been fluent since I was five

25:43.798 --> 25:46.232
I spent my childhood in London

25:46.925 --> 25:52.443
- Don't you ever speak in class?
- To show off to a useless teacher?

25:53.138 --> 25:54.696
What about maths?

25:55.013 --> 25:56.651
That's a different story

25:56.974 --> 26:02.207
Let's get started then. Your syllabus
is easy. Give me your book

26:02.644 --> 26:04.441
I don't have one

26:05.562 --> 26:07.712
What else are you missing?

26:08.023 --> 26:09.342
I have nothing

26:09.607 --> 26:11.120
Not even a folder?

26:11.441 --> 26:14.239
- Nothing
- And you think it's funny?

26:14.569 --> 26:17.037
If X is between 1.5 and infinity...

26:27.786 --> 26:30.903
Write down the subject
of the next essay

26:31.288 --> 26:36.237
Once the Freudian unconscious becomes
part of modern psychology...

26:36.667 --> 26:39.340
...what happens to human freedom?

26:40.587 --> 26:44.136
And what role can it play?

26:44.840 --> 26:46.990
Not so fast

26:50.844 --> 26:52.402
Listen, Miss

26:54.263 --> 26:56.254
Don't be so formal

27:01.268 --> 27:03.384
- Forget it
- They're calling No�

27:06.229 --> 27:08.140
That's you, I suppose

27:08.439 --> 27:10.907
Yes, my dad calls me No�

27:46.214 --> 27:48.011
Who's that guy?

27:52.177 --> 27:53.929
What did he want?

27:54.596 --> 27:57.588
Money. He's a childhood friend

27:58.182 --> 27:59.820
From Paris?

28:01.267 --> 28:03.258
What does he do?

28:04.644 --> 28:05.872
Nothing

28:06.770 --> 28:10.445
- What does he live on?
- I'm not his mother

28:12.316 --> 28:15.911
Do you have to hide to give him money?

28:18.278 --> 28:20.508
Shall we get back to work?

28:43.337 --> 28:45.328
See you tomorrow

28:55.011 --> 28:57.047
You know what someone wanted today?

28:59.848 --> 29:01.440
Something wrong?

29:01.850 --> 29:03.249
I'm fine

29:05.769 --> 29:08.488
So, what did they want?

29:08.813 --> 29:14.206
Your book: "Simone Weil's Mystical
Philosophy" by Fran�ois Hainaut

29:14.775 --> 29:17.926
Would you sell one of your last copies

29:18.445 --> 29:21.198
- Who wants it?
- A young man

29:42.085 --> 29:45.964
<i>Hello may I speak to Mr Hainaut
please?</i>

29:46.380 --> 29:47.574
Hold on

29:48.131 --> 29:49.530
It's for you

29:59.013 --> 30:01.573
<i>I just called to say good night</i>

30:06.686 --> 30:08.244
You've got my number?

30:08.520 --> 30:13.548
<i>It's in the phonebook I'm going
to bed now Love you lots and lots</i>

30:14.649 --> 30:15.968
Good night

30:28.326 --> 30:29.884
So, your book?

30:35.705 --> 30:36.854
Problems?

30:45.879 --> 30:48.029
What's bothering you?

30:48.840 --> 30:49.989
Nothing

30:50.966 --> 30:53.434
What's special about your student?

30:54.093 --> 30:55.492
Which one?

30:56.803 --> 30:58.794
The one you're so familiar with

31:01.598 --> 31:03.668
There's not much to say

31:09.020 --> 31:10.817
Tell me anyway

31:13.815 --> 31:15.965
She's quite amazing

31:18.067 --> 31:22.185
At first you think she might as well
not be at school

31:23.488 --> 31:26.207
Then you realise she's amazing

31:27.491 --> 31:32.121
Sometimes when you're marking essays
you come across a brilliant passage

31:32.536 --> 31:37.246
So you forget the essay's weaknesses
and give an excellent grade...

31:37.664 --> 31:39.859
...in the excitement of the moment

31:41.834 --> 31:47.830
For the first time in my life, I feel
I've met a truly exceptional person

31:50.966 --> 31:53.241
At only 17...

31:54.134 --> 31:57.763
...she's deeply aware of the futility
of human life

31:59.513 --> 32:02.391
And she cuts through
to what really matters

32:02.724 --> 32:04.794
Is she that brilliant?

32:05.308 --> 32:07.947
She's behind...

32:08.644 --> 32:13.081
...in spelling and maths.
But it's superficial

32:14.481 --> 32:17.314
At first I just helped her to stay
at school

32:17.651 --> 32:20.802
Then your enthusiasm led to familiarity

32:21.736 --> 32:23.806
No, only afterwards

32:27.198 --> 32:29.666
Sometimes I want to push her further...

32:31.785 --> 32:33.776
...on the path to wisdom

32:35.037 --> 32:37.426
You never do that with me now

32:37.747 --> 32:39.658
You don't need it any more

32:42.959 --> 32:45.075
Are you in love with her?

32:45.544 --> 32:47.136
You're so silly

32:48.713 --> 32:50.908
Promise me it won't happen

32:51.507 --> 32:52.986
You're so silly

32:54.509 --> 32:58.502
No need to promise. I've never fancied
young girls

33:00.513 --> 33:02.743
You're the only one for me

33:36.705 --> 33:38.184
Who was it?

33:46.669 --> 33:48.148
You get it

33:56.134 --> 34:00.446
Hello. How are you? Did you sleep well

34:01.846 --> 34:03.598
Do you need anything?

34:03.890 --> 34:07.485
<i>Just to say hello Lots of love
See you in a minute</i>

34:07.850 --> 34:09.249
All right

34:12.520 --> 34:16.354
Your student? Tell her not to hang up
when I pick up

34:16.731 --> 34:18.562
Why do you think it's her?

34:22.735 --> 34:26.887
<i>Essay Can the unconscious
be considered another self?</i>

34:27.280 --> 34:28.838
You still have 90 minutes

34:58.510 --> 35:02.105
It's good, but it's riddled
with spelling mistakes

36:06.307 --> 36:09.777
Honestly! Here, here and here

36:11.519 --> 36:14.192
- Anything for wiping the board?
- There

36:23.985 --> 36:25.464
It was you?

36:26.821 --> 36:29.460
I've started reading it. It's beautiful

36:36.786 --> 36:39.698
"God waits like a beggar
standing still...

36:40.038 --> 36:43.553
"...before someone he hopes
will give him some bread

36:43.957 --> 36:46.835
"Time is God's patience as he begs
for our love

36:47.167 --> 36:49.840
"Modest beggars are in His own image"

36:50.336 --> 36:54.170
The philosopher is a citizen
who couldn't exist...

36:54.548 --> 36:58.905
...without the concept of policing.
Politics is the expression of policing

36:59.301 --> 37:04.739
Man is a man when he belongs to the
city and defines himself as a citizen

37:05.180 --> 37:07.375
Any idea why Miss Tessier isn't here?

37:14.562 --> 37:16.120
May I carry on?

39:31.739 --> 39:33.457
What's going on?

39:37.910 --> 39:41.698
Why weren't you at school?
Don't say you were ill

39:42.079 --> 39:44.593
- Someone will hear
- Let them hear

40:09.556 --> 40:11.990
Who's the guy who's just left?

40:12.766 --> 40:14.324
Are you jealous?

40:15.227 --> 40:16.706
I'm glad

40:18.937 --> 40:20.928
Did they stay the night?

40:22.189 --> 40:24.623
Don't be cross. They often do

40:24.942 --> 40:26.773
Do you take me for a fool?

41:08.555 --> 41:10.625
Come on. Don't be afraid

42:25.565 --> 42:28.602
I hadn't felt like this since childhood

42:51.583 --> 42:57.055
<i>When X is between infinity and 15
and F' of X is negative</i>

43:11.889 --> 43:13.959
See you tomorrow at eight

43:16.850 --> 43:18.761
Won't you stay?

43:19.311 --> 43:21.347
No, I have to go home

44:20.227 --> 44:24.584
- You're here?
- Yes, every night. How are you?

44:25.272 --> 44:27.911
Still looking after your schoolgirl?

44:28.233 --> 44:30.224
What do you mean?

44:30.859 --> 44:34.613
- Are you in love?
- Why do you say that?

45:03.340 --> 45:06.138
<i>FRAN�OIS LO VES ANO THER WOMAN</i>

45:16.558 --> 45:19.595
It'll be a paranoid or resentful
student

45:20.351 --> 45:21.750
<i>we're all delighted...</i>

45:22.020 --> 45:25.569
...with Miss Tessier's spectacular
progress

45:25.938 --> 45:28.577
I wish you all a good holiday

45:38.239 --> 45:42.755
You were right.
Mathilde has hugely improved in English

45:43.159 --> 45:46.435
- Really? Congratulations
- Thank you

45:48.830 --> 45:52.459
We're so happy about what you did
for Mathilde

45:52.832 --> 45:53.981
What's that?

45:54.250 --> 46:00.200
We thought she was going to sink.
But she got a grip on herself thanks to you

46:00.671 --> 46:05.187
- It's really thanks to her
- 'Bye. Are you going away?

46:06.425 --> 46:08.814
Enjoy the break anyway

46:10.469 --> 46:13.586
Are you going away with Catherine?

46:13.930 --> 46:16.205
- You've changed
- For the better?

46:16.515 --> 46:19.632
I don't recognise you.
Do you need some help?

46:19.976 --> 46:24.208
- I'm fine. Do you want a lift?
- I've a call to make first

46:58.127 --> 46:59.560
You're crazy

47:00.253 --> 47:03.848
- What are you doing here?
- I want to make love

47:05.215 --> 47:08.810
- Don't you want to know what they said?
- I don't care

47:11.469 --> 47:14.461
You're crazy. What if they see us?

48:03.254 --> 48:08.123
I'm happy. We're going to be together
for two weeks

48:09.300 --> 48:13.578
If you like we can go to the country.
The weather's nice

48:15.054 --> 48:17.568
I'm starting to need you

48:30.773 --> 48:31.808
<i>Hi No�</i>

48:32.400 --> 48:34.356
Hi, what's up?

48:34.651 --> 48:40.601
<i>Your mum's in hospital again You
must come up at once Promise me</i>

48:42.782 --> 48:44.261
<i>See you tomorrow</i>

48:45.033 --> 48:47.342
<i>- All right
- Love you</i>

48:54.831 --> 48:56.025
What's up?

48:57.917 --> 49:01.148
Mum's tried to kill herself again.
That was dad

49:02.044 --> 49:03.682
Is it serious?

49:04.630 --> 49:07.588
It must be, for dad to have called

49:08.925 --> 49:10.517
Will you go?

49:11.718 --> 49:15.188
I can go with you. I finish work
in two days

49:22.225 --> 49:25.854
- Do your brothers know?
- We can't contact them

49:26.270 --> 49:31.105
They went to Columbia, then India.
Since then, not a word

49:32.816 --> 49:35.250
They were in trouble with the police?

49:40.571 --> 49:42.084
They were 15

49:42.906 --> 49:45.784
They dealt drugs to get their daily fix

49:46.659 --> 49:49.537
They got caught and were forced...

49:49.869 --> 49:51.860
...to go into rehab

49:52.162 --> 49:54.471
Hadn't your father noticed?

49:59.876 --> 50:01.275
What about you?

50:01.544 --> 50:05.503
Me? I was 11 and I was like them

50:06.798 --> 50:08.595
You took drugs too?

50:10.466 --> 50:12.457
They got me started

50:14.136 --> 50:16.570
Weren't you caught by the police?

50:16.970 --> 50:20.167
I was 11. They never suspected

50:22.057 --> 50:26.175
They supplied you? What happened
when they were in rehab?

50:37.318 --> 50:39.354
I went into prostitution

50:42.738 --> 50:46.572
I got into a network.
There were other young girls

50:46.950 --> 50:51.978
There were meetings where men came,
sometimes with their wives

50:53.120 --> 50:56.157
You mustn't think it was tough
or traumatic

50:56.790 --> 50:59.179
We just got on with it

51:12.842 --> 51:15.436
How long did it last?

51:16.804 --> 51:19.193
Two years. No, three

51:20.014 --> 51:22.972
Then I managed to stop by myself

51:24.225 --> 51:26.785
I can be very strong for some things

51:32.564 --> 51:34.361
Don't be angry

51:35.524 --> 51:37.515
I'm telling you because I trust you

51:38.277 --> 51:39.949
Do you understand?

51:42.238 --> 51:45.310
I've heard all drug addicts
become liars

51:45.823 --> 51:49.862
They all say that's it,
they're going to stop

51:50.701 --> 51:52.373
Aren't I right?

51:57.247 --> 51:59.636
Why would you be different?

52:02.459 --> 52:04.529
I swear it to you

52:07.254 --> 52:09.085
I know I don't lie

52:09.923 --> 52:12.676
If you don't believe me, tough

52:15.260 --> 52:17.455
Do you want my number in Paris?

52:37.233 --> 52:39.224
What's the point?

52:49.450 --> 52:50.644
Wait

53:25.933 --> 53:28.925
Stop it. You're too good at this

54:21.805 --> 54:24.194
It hasn't stopped ringing

54:25.640 --> 54:27.676
They hang up when I pick up

54:29.518 --> 54:31.395
Any idea who it is?

54:38.066 --> 54:40.375
Did you ask her about the letter?

54:42.861 --> 54:44.055
Well?

54:46.988 --> 54:49.786
Maybe you wrote it to sound me out

54:51.658 --> 54:53.250
Not the damsel in distress!

54:55.786 --> 54:57.583
Jealous at your age?

56:17.509 --> 56:18.942
I've had it

56:20.511 --> 56:25.505
I need to think. We should spend
a few days apart, just the holidays

56:25.931 --> 56:30.607
I'll go. Do what you like,
but have a good think

56:31.101 --> 56:33.456
I'll stay at the bookshop

56:40.149 --> 56:45.223
These calls will have to stop.
If you won't do anything about it, I will

57:23.179 --> 57:25.056
Have a good holiday

57:26.181 --> 57:28.775
Don't forget the essay

58:17.049 --> 58:19.517
<i>Hello how are you?</i>

58:19.884 --> 58:24.912
It's good to hear your voice. I tried
to call, but it was always engaged

58:25.346 --> 58:27.018
<i>I miss you</i>

58:28.306 --> 58:29.534
How's your mum?

58:29.808 --> 58:34.199
<i>She slit her wrists in the bath
It was serious this time</i>

58:34.602 --> 58:37.435
<i>You know what she said
when she woke up?</i>

58:37.938 --> 58:40.975
<i>"It was beautiful like a huge ocean</i>

58:41.316 --> 58:44.626
<i>"I was melting into it
It was lovely"</i>

58:44.984 --> 58:46.622
Shall I come up?

58:46.903 --> 58:51.499
<i>Bad idea One of my brothers is back
We don't know where the other one is</i>

58:51.906 --> 58:55.182
<i>I'm looking after everyone
especially my dad</i>

58:55.533 --> 58:58.764
I'm sorry about what happened
before you left

58:59.119 --> 59:02.077
<i>- I miss you
- I miss you too</i>

59:03.456 --> 59:06.971
<i>I have to go I'll be back as soon as I can</i>

59:07.417 --> 59:09.408
<i>We'll need to talk</i>

59:10.127 --> 59:12.322
<i>'Bye I love you</i>

59:12.629 --> 59:14.028
Me too

59:14.755 --> 59:16.507
Try to call again

59:17.674 --> 59:19.790
It's good to hear your voice

59:44.651 --> 59:47.165
<i>It's Mathilde Are you alone?</i>

59:48.027 --> 59:50.097
<i>Go to your front door</i>

1:00:18.423 --> 1:00:21.813
I need you so much. How I missed you!

1:01:07.665 --> 1:01:10.941
I was scared suddenly.
Scared you had left

1:01:12.043 --> 1:01:14.796
In Paris I could only think of you

1:01:15.129 --> 1:01:18.121
I was going mad. I kept wanting to call

1:01:18.464 --> 1:01:20.534
I didn't care about anyone

1:01:21.091 --> 1:01:24.322
Not even my mother disfigured by pain

1:01:24.677 --> 1:01:26.872
Not even my father or my brothers

1:01:27.679 --> 1:01:29.874
I can't live without you any more

1:01:32.974 --> 1:01:34.453
Throw your wife out

1:01:35.185 --> 1:01:36.538
I can't

1:01:41.063 --> 1:01:42.291
Then leave her

1:01:43.064 --> 1:01:47.421
Come and live with me.
It's small, but we can move

1:01:49.068 --> 1:01:50.467
We can't

1:01:52.154 --> 1:01:53.872
Because of school?

1:01:56.366 --> 1:01:57.640
You're 17

1:01:57.908 --> 1:01:59.227
So what?

1:02:00.284 --> 1:02:02.844
In ten years I'll be an old man

1:02:03.579 --> 1:02:06.173
You already are when you talk like that

1:02:18.756 --> 1:02:22.112
Do you know many couples who last?

1:02:23.968 --> 1:02:25.879
Look around you

1:02:36.142 --> 1:02:37.416
I love you

1:02:37.977 --> 1:02:42.732
Whether you're old, fat, skinny or sick
it won't change anything

1:02:43.147 --> 1:02:44.819
It's deeply rooted in me

1:02:48.234 --> 1:02:53.911
Who knows where we'll be in ten years?
We might be dead. You might be

1:02:55.448 --> 1:02:56.722
Or me

1:02:58.491 --> 1:03:00.766
I love you like I've never loved before

1:03:05.538 --> 1:03:07.847
You made a woman of me

1:03:12.584 --> 1:03:14.939
Can't you see I'm begging you?

1:03:32.681 --> 1:03:35.753
What would we live on? Love alone?

1:03:37.143 --> 1:03:39.134
It would be romantic

1:03:40.770 --> 1:03:42.647
What do you mean?

1:03:43.397 --> 1:03:48.027
No one will ever condone a teacher
my age seeing his student

1:03:50.318 --> 1:03:52.513
Especially since you're a minor

1:03:55.655 --> 1:03:58.772
Ask to be transferred to another town

1:03:59.116 --> 1:04:02.233
I'll pretend to be your daughter

1:04:03.327 --> 1:04:04.919
Or I'll hide

1:04:05.579 --> 1:04:09.697
So no one can see me,
I'll live like a recluse

1:04:13.250 --> 1:04:15.844
I've no pride left

1:04:16.169 --> 1:04:17.966
So long as I'm with you

1:04:23.299 --> 1:04:25.529
It wouldn't last two months

1:04:29.386 --> 1:04:34.983
One day you told me no one knew
what life had in store for them...

1:04:35.474 --> 1:04:38.864
...and despair was a sign of vanity

1:04:41.645 --> 1:04:46.161
You said we should approach life
with open minds. So?

1:04:49.025 --> 1:04:52.301
People can think what they like.
We're different

1:04:52.653 --> 1:04:54.644
We need to find our own way

1:04:55.862 --> 1:04:58.251
Have faith in me and life

1:05:05.536 --> 1:05:07.731
I've no right to your life

1:05:10.456 --> 1:05:15.450
That means you don't have the courage
to leave your wife and live with me

1:05:20.129 --> 1:05:23.326
We're going to make love one last time

1:05:25.008 --> 1:05:27.158
Then there'll be nothing left...

1:05:27.969 --> 1:05:30.483
...if we still need to see each other

1:06:46.563 --> 1:06:48.554
Are you hurting?

1:06:50.191 --> 1:06:52.580
You've stopped seeing her?

1:06:54.402 --> 1:06:56.677
It's better for you

1:06:56.987 --> 1:06:58.978
What would you know?

1:07:01.657 --> 1:07:03.648
You'll get over it in time

1:07:11.581 --> 1:07:13.537
Won't you talk to me?

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:16.157
She wanted me to leave you

1:07:18.793 --> 1:07:20.863
Why didn't you follow her?

1:07:22.963 --> 1:07:24.954
Because of me?

1:07:28.759 --> 1:07:30.829
Because she was 17?

1:08:13.456 --> 1:08:15.731
Cut the chatter

1:08:16.708 --> 1:08:21.736
I hope you had a good break
and you finished your essays

1:08:23.088 --> 1:08:25.124
Carpentier will collect them

1:08:36.764 --> 1:08:39.676
For Nietzsche, pure thought
doesn't exist

1:08:42.309 --> 1:08:48.020
In the same way, philosophy's claim
to stating pure truth...

1:08:49.231 --> 1:08:50.949
...is a mystification

1:08:52.316 --> 1:08:57.106
For Nietzsche, a metaphysician
is someone who's chosen death

1:08:57.528 --> 1:08:59.678
Someone dedicated to metaphysics...

1:08:59.988 --> 1:09:04.584
...God and perfection,
but who doesn't want to live

1:09:08.118 --> 1:09:10.109
He can't bear life

1:09:13.622 --> 1:09:17.695
So he discards it with great
philosophical elegance

1:09:18.376 --> 1:09:20.446
And he invents a new one...

1:09:20.752 --> 1:09:25.826
...which he calls the other side,
God, the other life...

1:09:26.256 --> 1:09:28.531
...morals with a capital 'M'

1:09:30.967 --> 1:09:36.166
But let's not be fooled. This whole
philosophical construction...

1:09:39.265 --> 1:09:43.338
...only serves to hide
this unconscious notion

1:09:43.726 --> 1:09:47.924
I can't bear it. I can't bear life

1:09:49.105 --> 1:09:52.415
So I invent another one...

1:09:53.233 --> 1:09:57.067
...for very concrete, mundane reasons

1:09:59.529 --> 1:10:02.282
This whole philosophical
construction...

1:10:04.032 --> 1:10:05.909
...only serves...

1:10:06.325 --> 1:10:09.840
...to hide a wretched existence

1:10:12.496 --> 1:10:14.009
The tired life...

1:10:16.082 --> 1:10:17.561
...of the philosopher...

1:10:17.833 --> 1:10:19.744
...who denied his own life

1:10:28.882 --> 1:10:31.112
Sorry, were you talking to me?

1:10:31.426 --> 1:10:33.178
Stand up, please

1:10:38.055 --> 1:10:40.444
Can you repeat what I said?

1:10:43.183 --> 1:10:45.253
Why weren't you listening?

1:10:45.561 --> 1:10:46.550
I was...

1:10:46.811 --> 1:10:49.279
- But I couldn't hear
- See me after the class

1:10:49.604 --> 1:10:51.834
I can't. I'm seeing the counsellor

1:10:52.148 --> 1:10:53.979
I'll make your excuses

1:10:55.442 --> 1:10:57.637
I also have to see the bursar

1:10:57.944 --> 1:11:00.253
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you

1:11:19.125 --> 1:11:21.116
I need a word in private

1:11:22.586 --> 1:11:24.178
I'm sorry, sir

1:11:24.462 --> 1:11:29.377
But we wanted to tell you that Mathild
has a new address

1:11:30.382 --> 1:11:32.418
We're living together at my place

1:11:35.678 --> 1:11:38.750
You can speak. Don't mind him

1:11:39.097 --> 1:11:42.248
He advises me and will always
take care of me

1:11:43.934 --> 1:11:45.287
Get out

1:11:46.352 --> 1:11:48.183
I thought you'd be pleased

1:11:48.478 --> 1:11:50.673
Get out, I said

1:11:53.523 --> 1:11:56.720
For a teacher, you could be more polite

1:14:09.950 --> 1:14:12.100
Who's this one?

1:14:12.952 --> 1:14:14.943
You whore

1:14:16.829 --> 1:14:18.501
Forget it

1:14:21.166 --> 1:14:23.964
You've no right to hit students, sir

1:14:24.418 --> 1:14:29.287
Only to punish them if you can prove
they're in the wrong

1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.036
Who was it?

1:15:27.753 --> 1:15:29.027
Guess

1:15:33.382 --> 1:15:34.576
Impossible

1:15:35.383 --> 1:15:38.739
I got a call after you left
this morning

1:15:40.053 --> 1:15:41.452
It was her

1:15:42.597 --> 1:15:44.713
She called me a bitch

1:15:45.932 --> 1:15:47.923
She promised she'd kill me

1:15:51.977 --> 1:15:54.935
I had a similar message two days ago

1:15:56.105 --> 1:15:59.222
On top of the night calls,
that's too much

1:16:38.968 --> 1:16:42.244
Come here, please. I need you

1:17:27.709 --> 1:17:29.700
Come on, students. Upstairs

1:17:31.921 --> 1:17:34.196
You too, Miss Tessier

1:17:49.642 --> 1:17:51.633
Can I have a word?

1:18:03.442 --> 1:18:04.716
Expel her

1:18:05.528 --> 1:18:07.519
Or put her in another class

1:18:08.529 --> 1:18:10.326
On what pretext?

1:18:10.615 --> 1:18:14.733
There are only a few weeks to go.
You're not a boy

1:18:15.660 --> 1:18:17.252
Sometimes I wonder

1:18:24.290 --> 1:18:27.600
It's your wife. She says it's serious

1:18:33.505 --> 1:18:34.779
Tell me

1:18:53.227 --> 1:18:56.697
<i>The Hainaut woman is an old bitch</i>

1:19:01.482 --> 1:19:02.801
Who did that?

1:19:03.066 --> 1:19:04.897
Two guys on motorbikes

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:15.752
That's not all. When I took the car
earlier, a guy in a van bumped into me

1:19:16.201 --> 1:19:21.514
As if he'd been waiting for me. One
bump wasn't enough, so he did it again

1:19:23.414 --> 1:19:25.530
I thought he was going to kill me

1:19:28.167 --> 1:19:29.486
Any witnesses?

1:19:29.752 --> 1:19:33.984
When people arrived, the driver
ran off, leaving the van behind

1:19:35.006 --> 1:19:36.997
What time was that?

1:19:37.382 --> 1:19:38.610
9.15

1:19:43.719 --> 1:19:44.708
There's more

1:19:46.847 --> 1:19:49.361
My editor has received threats

1:19:51.142 --> 1:19:54.817
- They're telling him to fire me or else
- That's ludicrous

1:19:55.185 --> 1:20:00.942
Maybe, but there have been bomb alerts
so he's delaying publishing my article

1:20:05.943 --> 1:20:06.932
It's her

1:20:09.279 --> 1:20:12.555
- She was at school
- Then she has accomplices

1:20:16.408 --> 1:20:18.478
Things can't go on like this

1:20:20.661 --> 1:20:23.221
I can't take any more

1:20:39.841 --> 1:20:43.629
- Where are the A3?
- English. Room 512

1:20:53.392 --> 1:20:55.269
Miss Tessier, come with me

1:21:00.355 --> 1:21:01.834
Are you coming?

1:21:37.506 --> 1:21:39.861
Is this going to last long?

1:21:54.559 --> 1:21:56.550
I love you

1:23:51.597 --> 1:23:53.269
- What do you want?
- My bag...

1:23:53.556 --> 1:23:58.550
Come back later. The door is locked.
I'll get the key

1:23:59.602 --> 1:24:04.596
Have you seen Hainaut? The head
wants to see him and Miss Tessier

1:24:05.023 --> 1:24:06.820
It's serious

1:24:07.942 --> 1:24:11.776
He must be in the staff room
or in a classroom

1:24:12.737 --> 1:24:15.570
Or maybe outside. Come with me

1:24:32.209 --> 1:24:35.565
Hey, there's a teacher screwing
a naked girl

1:24:44.300 --> 1:24:46.416
<i>Mathilde's mother died the next day</i>

1:24:46.718 --> 1:24:51.075
<i>She went back to Paris after trying
to see Fran�ois again</i>

1:24:51.471 --> 1:24:55.350
<i>He was rebuked by the department</i>

1:24:55.724 --> 1:24:58.557
<i>and quickly transferred to Dunkirk</i>

1:24:58.893 --> 1:25:00.485
<i>Catherine deeply hurt</i>

1:25:00.769 --> 1:25:05.399
<i>didn't forgive him They separated
and he left her the house</i>

1:25:06.773 --> 1:25:09.970
<i>Mathilde vanished from their lives</i>

1:25:11.943 --> 1:25:13.740
<i>Over a year passed</i>

1:26:15.445 --> 1:26:17.720
<i>Mr Fran�ois Hainaut?</i>

1:26:19.073 --> 1:26:24.705
<i>This is police officer Gabaston
Can you come to 6 rue Lombard now?</i>

1:26:25.536 --> 1:26:29.688
<i>We've found the body of a young girl
Miss Tessier</i>

1:26:36.460 --> 1:26:38.769
<i>Hello are you still there?</i>

1:26:39.087 --> 1:26:43.000
<i>- Here? In Dunkirk?
- Yes here in Dunkirk</i>

1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:35.110
Do you recognise her?

1:27:42.172 --> 1:27:44.049
Poor girl

1:27:44.590 --> 1:27:46.740
Can you imagine?

1:27:47.467 --> 1:27:49.617
She let herself die

1:27:52.679 --> 1:27:55.318
She took this room two months ago

1:27:55.722 --> 1:27:59.635
She didn't go out.
She didn't see anyone

1:28:00.017 --> 1:28:03.009
She lived as a recluse

1:28:05.812 --> 1:28:11.250
She used to sit all day...

1:28:14.444 --> 1:28:16.639
...Looking out the window

1:28:22.740 --> 1:28:26.130
I did her shopping every other day

1:28:48.592 --> 1:28:52.301
That's your address and phone number,
right?

1:28:54.387 --> 1:28:57.345
So, you must have seen her sometimes

1:28:59.891 --> 1:29:02.530
You didn't even know she lived here?

1:29:03.060 --> 1:29:04.539
<i>Sorry</i>

1:29:09.898 --> 1:29:12.173
You're Fran�ois, aren't you?

1:29:22.156 --> 1:29:24.875
So, what did she mean?

1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:28.795
THERE'S THE OCEAN, FRAN�OIS
