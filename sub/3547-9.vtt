00:00.083 --> 00:02.083
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.291 --> 00:04.208
<i>Wisteria Lane's new hero...</i>

00:04.291 --> 00:06.917
- Hello?
- Superhero houses are great!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.542
<i>...turned out to be anything but.</i>

00:10.709 --> 00:12.458
<i>Orson's mother took up residence.</i>

00:12.542 --> 00:15.125
I decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.

00:15.208 --> 00:16.250
You wouldn't.

00:16.333 --> 00:17.542
<i>And Mike couldn't remember...</i>

00:17.625 --> 00:19.250
No memory? That's convenient.

00:19.333 --> 00:20.500
<i>...anything at all.</i>

00:20.583 --> 00:23.250
- Here's our search warrant.
- We couldn't find a toolbox.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.041
You might want to wash
that wrench off.

00:26.125 --> 00:28.250
It's got something on it.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.709
Yes.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.750
I'm just saying that we never spend
the night at your house.

00:33.834 --> 00:36.125
Yeah, but your place is
so warm and cosy.

00:36.208 --> 00:40.208
Well, it's also a disaster area.
I didn't get a chance to clean it today.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.500
Oh, here. Let me.

00:43.125 --> 00:46.834
<i>Susan Mayer had never thought</i>
<i>of herself as Cinderella,</i>

00:47.625 --> 00:51.750
<i>but then one day a prince showed up.</i>

00:53.959 --> 00:57.750
Well, we can't have you sleeping in
squalor, can we?

00:57.834 --> 00:59.083
My place it is.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
<i>And Susan realised her life</i>
<i>had become a fairy tale.</i>

01:08.291 --> 01:12.333
<i>And since her prince had welcomed</i>
<i>her into his castle,</i>

01:13.417 --> 01:17.208
<i>she felt the least she could do</i>
<i>was thank him.</i>

01:17.291 --> 01:21.959
<i>Again and again and again.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:27.166
<i>The next morning, however,</i>
<i>Susan discovered castles</i>

01:28.875 --> 01:31.375
<i>don't run themselves.</i>

01:36.250 --> 01:37.875
All right.

01:37.959 --> 01:42.291
But let's make it a quickie
'cause you are wasting water.

01:44.417 --> 01:47.458
Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.

01:48.458 --> 01:51.083
- Who are you?
- I'm Rupert.

01:51.166 --> 01:52.834
I work for Mr Hainsworth.

01:52.917 --> 01:57.667
That would be the man you slept with,
in case names weren't exchanged.

01:57.750 --> 02:00.542
Oh, no. I'm your boss' girlfriend.

02:00.625 --> 02:04.834
- Surely he mentioned me.
- Not that I recollect.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.208
Rupert.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.166
Good morning, boss.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.375
I thought you were off today.
Isn't your sister in town?

02:12.458 --> 02:14.583
That's next weekend, sir.

02:15.625 --> 02:17.166
It's a good thing, too.

02:17.250 --> 02:21.834
Otherwise, I might not have had
the pleasure of meeting your girlfriend.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.166
Susan.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.792
Yes. We met at the hospital.

02:28.625 --> 02:32.000
- Why don't I fetch you a robe?
- Loving that idea.

02:39.500 --> 02:44.000
Would you care for some breakfast?
Omelette, strawberry tart, brioche?

02:44.083 --> 02:45.625
Oh, wow!

02:45.709 --> 02:49.417
Yeah. That sounds great. You pick.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.542
<i>Yes, Susan's life had indeed</i>
<i>become a fairy tale.</i>

02:53.625 --> 02:57.000
You are aware
there is a Mrs Hainsworth?

02:57.667 --> 02:59.250
Well, of course.

02:59.333 --> 03:03.125
<i>- And what's a fairy tale...</i>
- Tart it is.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.375
<i>...without a dragon to slay?</i>

03:50.875 --> 03:54.041
<i>We know dangerous men</i>
<i>walk among us.</i>

03:54.125 --> 03:58.542
<i>What we can't be sure of is</i>
<i>who they are or where they hide.</i>

03:59.041 --> 04:03.417
<i>So the most we can offer any stranger</i>
<i>is reasonable doubt.</i>

04:03.500 --> 04:08.458
<i>But once the doubt is gone,</i>
<i>people are anything but reasonable.</i>

04:08.542 --> 04:11.875
I am telling you,
our neighbour is a paedophile,

04:11.959 --> 04:14.250
and I expect you
to do something about it.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.083
Mrs Scavo, he's not listed
on any sex offender registry.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.917
He's never had
so much as a traffic ticket.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.750
He's a single man
with a basement full of toys!

04:21.834 --> 04:25.875
I understand your concern, but we can't
book a guy on possession of toys.

04:25.959 --> 04:30.875
You don't get it. His house had
this creepy vibe. Tell him, Tom.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.291
I never went down to the actual room...

04:32.375 --> 04:33.959
Okay, he wasn't there,
he doesn't know.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.458
Look, he had a wall full of pictures

04:36.542 --> 04:39.458
of half-naked boys in swimsuits.

04:39.542 --> 04:42.000
Didn't you say he was a swim coach?

04:42.083 --> 04:43.542
What are you, his lawyer?

04:43.625 --> 04:45.917
- You have to admit, it's odd.
- Here's what's odd.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.208
If your neighbour had
something to hide,

04:48.291 --> 04:51.083
why'd he invite you in
to see all of his stuff?

04:57.375 --> 05:01.083
He wasn't technically home
when I went inside.

05:02.125 --> 05:06.041
- So you broke in?
- The door was open.

05:06.125 --> 05:08.625
I was bringing him a cake.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.917
- A cake?
- It was a thank you cake.

05:12.792 --> 05:15.083
He sort of saved my life.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.959
She didn't know
that he was a paedophile

05:18.041 --> 05:19.125
when she baked the actual cake.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.583
- He doesn't care about the cake, Tom.
- Why are you snapping at me?

05:21.667 --> 05:23.291
- I'm not snapping at you.
- You totally snapped.

05:23.375 --> 05:26.834
I am snapping because there is
a monster across the street,

05:26.917 --> 05:30.625
and Barney Fife here is making me
sound like the bad guy!

05:33.333 --> 05:36.834
Look, I'm sorry. She's been under
a lot of stress, hasn't slept well.

05:36.917 --> 05:39.792
You better not be apologising for me!

05:39.875 --> 05:41.458
Gotta go.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.458
So I've got some fabulous news.

05:49.542 --> 05:52.208
Well, I hope it's more fabulous
than this dress.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.834
I look like something
Ike Turner would hit.

05:54.917 --> 05:57.583
You're gonna have to find yourself
another personal shopper.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.667
What, I slam one dress
and you quit on me?

06:00.750 --> 06:02.000
No, that's my news.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.500
I'm leaving the store
and starting my own business.

06:06.208 --> 06:09.875
"Beauty by Vern"?
You're opening up a salon?

06:09.959 --> 06:11.458
God, could you get any gayer?

06:11.542 --> 06:14.542
It's a consulting firm
for beauty pageant contestants.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.959
And the answer's "yes."

06:17.041 --> 06:20.250
This week I'm coaching little girls
for the Miss Snowflake Pageant.

06:20.333 --> 06:23.583
It's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?

06:23.667 --> 06:26.542
If you come down and give a talk.
You know, give the kids some pointers.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.125
Vern, I worked the catwalks
in Milan and Paris.

06:29.208 --> 06:32.208
I'm not gonna give makeup tips
to Little Miss Training Bra.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.333
You have been in rare bitch form.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.667
It's been months now
so don't blame it on your cycle.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.291
Don't call me a bitch.

06:38.375 --> 06:41.500
And stop tracking my cycle.
I told you, that freaks me out.

06:41.583 --> 06:44.709
I'm just saying
you've been very cranky today.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.458
What's going on?

06:49.125 --> 06:51.417
The divorce decree
came through today.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.166
Carlos is officially out of my life.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.333
Oh, honey...

06:57.417 --> 06:59.250
The girls' ages range eight to 12.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.333
We meet every Thursday
in the rec room of the Elks Lodge.

07:02.417 --> 07:05.083
- I'm not doing it.
- You need a project.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.917
That's your problem, you're bored.
And you know what the cure for that is?

07:09.000 --> 07:10.834
Helping others.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.709
Fine. I'll do it.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.917
- But I want this dress for free.
- Evil. You said you hated it.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.917
And I hate helping others, too,
but I'm doing that, aren't I?

07:27.166 --> 07:30.083
Is the coast clear?
I don't want to flash the help again.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.250
Relax. He's making breakfast.

07:32.333 --> 07:35.250
But you're more than welcome
to flash me.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.458
- How long has Rupert worked for you?
- Oh, for years.

07:40.542 --> 07:42.333
He's practically family.

07:42.834 --> 07:45.792
So you're that close
and you never told him about me?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.834
Yes, about that...

07:47.959 --> 07:51.250
Rupert was incredibly devoted to Jane.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.417
He's never seen me
with another woman,

07:53.500 --> 07:56.041
let alone a frisky, naked one.

07:56.125 --> 07:59.583
Well, that explains why he was
a little cold to me this morning.

07:59.667 --> 08:02.875
- Was he? I'll have a talk with him.
- Oh, no. Don't do that.

08:02.959 --> 08:06.208
That'll just make it worse. I get it.
He loved Jane.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.792
He doesn't know me.
You know, I'll just have to charm him.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.500
Warm him up a little.

08:15.709 --> 08:19.625
Well, I'm sure you'll find a way.

08:19.709 --> 08:24.667
Great, 9:00 in the morning and I have
to put on a slinky black cocktail dress.

08:26.542 --> 08:28.208
Hey, here's an idea.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.834
You keep some things
in a drawer at my house.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.333
Would it be okay if I had one here?

08:33.417 --> 08:36.709
A drawer?
Do you think we'll be here that often?

08:37.250 --> 08:41.208
Your shower has six power nozzles.
With or without you, I'll be back.

08:41.291 --> 08:44.667
Well, then, by all means,
let's get you a drawer.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.959
I don't need much. One of those will do.

08:48.041 --> 08:51.917
Actually, that's not a good idea.
Rupert arranges things meticulously.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.291
You'll never win him over
if you mess with his system. Rupert?

08:56.583 --> 08:58.917
Wow. Your timing's perfect.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.417
Not always.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.458
- Susan will be needing a drawer.
- A drawer, sir?

09:05.542 --> 09:07.041
Yes. For her things.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.208
She's going to be spending
more time here.

09:09.291 --> 09:11.709
Yeah, Rupe.
I hope we can be good friends,

09:11.792 --> 09:14.041
'cause you're gonna be
seeing lots more of me.

09:14.125 --> 09:17.291
Oh, madam,
that hardly seems possible.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.625
Mother Hodge, your food will get cold.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.750
Why, please, is there a lock
on the liquor cabinet?

09:28.834 --> 09:32.333
Because your doctor says people
taking your medication shouldn't drink,

09:32.417 --> 09:34.667
a warning you've chosen to ignore

09:34.750 --> 09:38.208
if the lipstick on the vodka bottle
is any indication.

09:38.959 --> 09:43.166
Poached fish again? I don't want this.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.125
I want what you're all having.

09:45.208 --> 09:48.083
Well, your doctor has you on a low-fat,
low-sodium diet.

09:48.166 --> 09:51.875
Eight meals this week, eight times
I've told you the same thing.

09:52.208 --> 09:55.542
- So who would like to say grace?
- Allow me.

09:58.625 --> 10:01.959
Dear Lord, I thank you for this bland,
indifferently-prepared meal,

10:02.041 --> 10:04.875
and beseech you to ignite
some spark of compassion

10:04.959 --> 10:06.417
in my cold-hearted daughter-in-law,

10:06.500 --> 10:11.208
that she might show some shred
of mercy to me, her wretched captive.

10:11.291 --> 10:12.583
Amen.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.041
Mother, may I remind you,
you asked to come here.

10:21.125 --> 10:24.208
I didn't know I'd be trading one gaol
for another.

10:24.291 --> 10:28.542
At least at the home you could bribe
the orderlies to smuggle things in.

10:28.625 --> 10:31.750
But here, nothing gets
past the commandant.

10:32.917 --> 10:37.166
I have done everything I can
to make you happy and comfortable.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.291
- What do you want from us?
- I want my freedom.

10:40.375 --> 10:43.208
I want out of this perky little gulag

10:43.291 --> 10:46.375
and into a house I can call my own.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.083
And you're going to buy it for me.

10:49.166 --> 10:51.625
I can't afford to buy you a house.

10:51.709 --> 10:54.125
You can't afford not to.

10:57.917 --> 11:01.500
I know a house won't be easy to swing,
but how many more of these

11:01.583 --> 11:03.917
Edward Albee dinners
do you want to sit through?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.333
What did she mean by
"you can't afford not to"?

11:06.417 --> 11:08.166
Was she threatening you
or something?

11:08.250 --> 11:11.875
Yes, she's threatening to make us
miserable till we cave.

11:11.959 --> 11:14.542
Look, at least see if Edie has
any cheap listings.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.500
We'll be happier.
My mother will be happier.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.709
Yeah, and she'll take terrible care
of herself and be dead in a year.

11:19.792 --> 11:22.125
You just stole my next argument.

11:26.417 --> 11:28.208
Okay, you've got enough money

11:28.291 --> 11:32.291
to pay either the phone
or the cable bill, but not both.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.166
Hello? Mike?

11:37.625 --> 11:39.542
I'm trying to help you here.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.625
Oh, I'm sorry. Do whatever you want.

11:45.166 --> 11:47.500
Fine. Cable it is.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.834
Nobody calls you, anyway.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.542
What do you want?

12:01.625 --> 12:04.542
My toilet's clogged.
I thought maybe you could fix it.

12:04.625 --> 12:08.750
Oh, wait. You can't, can you?
Because you don't have any tools.

12:08.834 --> 12:12.041
Must be tough being a plumber
without tools.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.041
Why don't you people leave me
the hell alone?

12:14.125 --> 12:17.709
Jeez. You sure are hostile for a guy
who makes his living

12:17.792 --> 12:19.750
in the service industry.

12:34.208 --> 12:37.500
You know, it just occurred to me,
there's no point in paying the cable bill

12:37.583 --> 12:39.917
if you're not gonna have electricity.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.083
So, I'm thinking,
"Pay the electricity up front

12:43.166 --> 12:46.375
"and send a cheque
to the phone company..."

13:01.667 --> 13:03.959
Where have you been?
They're all waiting for you.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.291
I'm here to teach fashion.
So, I'm fashionably late.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.959
Cute. Now remember, these mothers
have refinanced their trailers

13:09.041 --> 13:10.834
in order to pay for this,
so when you make your entrance,

13:10.917 --> 13:12.834
for God sakes, sparkle.

13:15.959 --> 13:19.000
In addition to her three <i>Vogue </i>covers,
you may remember her

13:19.083 --> 13:20.959
as the face of La Roque Cosmetics.

13:21.041 --> 13:23.750
Please welcome
Miss Gabrielle Marquez!

13:36.208 --> 13:38.250
Vern? A moment.

13:43.166 --> 13:44.417
Is there a problem?

13:44.500 --> 13:47.166
Yes! What am I supposed to do
with that petting zoo out there?

13:47.250 --> 13:50.125
Not everyone wins
the genetic lottery like you did.

13:50.208 --> 13:54.000
These girls need help finding
the Promised Land of beauty and style.

13:54.083 --> 13:57.250
Please, Gabrielle, be their Moses.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.834
Good comparison,
because it's gonna take a miracle

14:00.917 --> 14:03.542
to turn these mutts into show dogs.

14:05.917 --> 14:08.834
Hey, girls. Let's talk beauty.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.500
What's up, brother?

14:19.375 --> 14:21.291
I'm sorry. You are?

14:21.375 --> 14:23.709
Carlos, from down the street.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.625
We were only best friends, dude.

14:29.959 --> 14:34.583
Well, things have been a little fuzzy
since the accident.

14:34.667 --> 14:37.417
I'm sorry that I hadn't come by sooner,

14:37.500 --> 14:40.625
but my divorce has been
kicking my ass.

14:40.709 --> 14:43.792
- Sorry to hear that.
- Anyway, I got a new condo,

14:43.875 --> 14:46.166
but it's getting renovated.

14:46.250 --> 14:49.542
So I was thinking,
maybe I could crash here?

14:49.625 --> 14:51.458
- Here?
- Yeah.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.417
I could help you out around the house.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.792
Free you up to focus on job one,
getting better.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.792
Because you're tossing it
to Edie now, right?

15:00.875 --> 15:03.417
That's a real relationship killer,

15:03.500 --> 15:06.291
needing your lady
to hoist you off the can.

15:07.542 --> 15:10.125
- How long we talking?
- Couple of months.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.917
Three at the most.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.041
And of course, I can kick in
for half the utilities and rent.

15:19.291 --> 15:22.250
Well, how can I say no
to my best friend?

15:28.792 --> 15:30.083
Can you do a kick-flip?

15:30.166 --> 15:33.792
What are the Blake kids
doing all the way over here?

15:33.875 --> 15:35.709
Pam needs to keep
a closer eye on them.

15:35.792 --> 15:38.208
Will you please come away
from that window?

15:38.291 --> 15:40.583
You barely slept last night.
Come on, take a nap.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.667
I'm fine. I'm fine.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.792
Hold on.

15:53.792 --> 15:55.667
Hey. What's up?

15:55.750 --> 15:59.500
I've been meaning to get this
back to you. And to thank you.

15:59.583 --> 16:02.583
Rebecca and I really enjoyed the cake.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.333
Oh, good.

16:05.417 --> 16:09.083
So, bye.

16:09.417 --> 16:11.625
So, what'd you think of our place?

16:12.834 --> 16:14.500
Sorry?

16:14.583 --> 16:16.834
I heard you were good friends
with the Young family.

16:16.917 --> 16:20.291
It must've been weird being in there
with all the new furniture.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.333
- I didn't notice.
- Well, how about the kitchen?

16:23.417 --> 16:26.291
Rebecca likes the colour,
but I'm not so sure.

16:26.375 --> 16:29.333
Oh, sorry.
Never made it past the living room.

16:29.417 --> 16:31.083
What? Come on.

16:31.166 --> 16:34.125
You're in an empty house,
curious about your new neighbours,

16:34.208 --> 16:35.709
you look around.

16:35.792 --> 16:38.417
- We all do it.
- Well, I don't.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.417
Well, next time you're over
I'll have to give you the tour.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.291
- Great.
- Mr Protector Man!

16:47.375 --> 16:49.458
Hey, hey. Not now, Parker.

16:49.542 --> 16:53.583
I just wanted to see if I can play
his pinball machine again!

17:00.917 --> 17:03.750
I guess there's no need for that tour.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.542
All right, girls, first things first.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.875
If you can't walk, you can't win.
Hit it, Vern.

17:20.417 --> 17:24.250
Remember, eyes forward,
shoulders back, hips square.

17:24.333 --> 17:27.291
Look left, look right, whip and walk.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.041
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

17:51.041 --> 17:53.500
- Okay, stop, stop.
- What?

17:53.583 --> 17:56.500
My eyes were forward,
my hips were square.

17:56.583 --> 18:00.125
But where's your confidence?
Where's your pride?

18:00.208 --> 18:03.166
Come on.
What do I have to be proud of?

18:14.166 --> 18:16.208
Have you guys ever seen
a runway model

18:16.291 --> 18:18.917
without the hot clothes and makeup?

18:19.750 --> 18:22.291
Well, trust me, they're not that special.

18:22.375 --> 18:26.333
But the one thing that they do have
is attitude.

18:26.417 --> 18:28.417
You have to believe in yourself.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.709
And if not, pretend
to believe in yourself, okay?

18:33.041 --> 18:34.208
All right.

18:34.291 --> 18:37.625
Now I want you to pretend
you're on the runway.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.750
Flashbulbs are popping.

18:39.834 --> 18:42.458
Everyone's looking at you,
envying you,

18:42.542 --> 18:45.959
and they're all thinking the same thing.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.834
Isabel Horowitz is smoking hot!

18:52.375 --> 18:53.959
Go, Isabel! Go!

18:58.625 --> 19:01.041
You're doing it, Isabel, you're doing it!

19:01.125 --> 19:03.000
That's it! Keep going!

19:07.959 --> 19:09.583
I was walking!

19:10.417 --> 19:13.417
You were totally walking! Good job!

19:13.500 --> 19:15.500
All right, Donna, you're next.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.000
Get up there
and make me hate your beauty.

19:20.875 --> 19:23.959
Now, this place is
a real diamond in the rough.

19:24.041 --> 19:29.000
Cosy little two-bedroom plus den
with a highly-motivated seller.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.959
Oh, look, a highly-motivated cockroach.

19:33.875 --> 19:37.208
Let's try to be positive, people.
It's a fabulous location,

19:37.291 --> 19:41.125
just walking distance
to all sorts of fun shops.

19:41.208 --> 19:45.583
Right, from here I can see a bail
bondsman and an adult bookshop.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.333
What do you expect
in your price range? Tara?

19:51.792 --> 19:53.959
Let's go. Thank you.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.458
Wait.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.542
I'm not an impractical woman.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.166
I know that my son's resources are,

20:00.250 --> 20:03.041
like his achievements, rather limited.

20:04.291 --> 20:06.166
I want to see the rest of it.

20:07.333 --> 20:08.583
Okay.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.083
Now, the lighting in the kitchen is
a bit harsh. The previous owner...

20:12.166 --> 20:16.750
Well, let's just say he ran some sort
of home-based medical business.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.041
You cannot let your mother move
into this neighbourhood.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.125
It's filled with junkies and whores!

20:22.208 --> 20:25.250
And we'll owe them all an apology.
But who cares? She likes it.

20:25.333 --> 20:28.583
Of course she likes it. There's
a 24-hour liquor store across the street.

20:28.667 --> 20:29.875
She wants a house.

20:29.959 --> 20:32.417
This is the best we can afford
without bankrupting ourselves.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.625
Orson, what if something
should happen to her?

20:34.709 --> 20:37.625
Stop worrying about her.
Worry about us.

20:37.709 --> 20:40.375
Do you realise how much
we've been fighting since she came?

20:40.458 --> 20:43.250
The woman's ruined every relationship
that's mattered to me,

20:43.333 --> 20:45.000
and she's doing it again!

20:45.083 --> 20:46.875
Oh, my God!

20:49.375 --> 20:50.959
- Are you all right?
- Mother!

20:51.041 --> 20:53.709
Just a little spill.
Her cane hit a loose tile.

20:53.792 --> 20:57.250
- Is anything broken?
- Well, obviously the damn floor!

20:57.333 --> 20:59.125
We'll need that fixed
before she moves in.

20:59.208 --> 21:02.125
Are you insane?
She obviously can't be on her own.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.750
- It's a loose tile.
- I'm perfectly fine.

21:04.834 --> 21:06.250
And what if you weren't?

21:06.333 --> 21:09.250
What if she had broken something
and she was lying here for hours?

21:09.333 --> 21:11.250
- You're coming home with us.
- Bree.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.709
And I will not hear another word
on the subject.

21:16.875 --> 21:20.500
- I can't believe you bought us pizza.
- Well, you guys earned it.

21:20.583 --> 21:23.000
But eat fast because
we only have one hour left,

21:23.083 --> 21:26.583
and I want to introduce you to
your new best friend, Mr Spray Tan.

21:26.667 --> 21:30.583
You know so much cool stuff.
Can't you come back another day?

21:30.667 --> 21:32.083
Oh, I don't know.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.000
- Please!
- You have to!

21:34.917 --> 21:36.625
Well, let me check my book.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.417
I might have to move
some stuff around,

21:38.500 --> 21:42.500
- but I think I can swing it.
- Your life must be so exciting, huh?

21:43.291 --> 21:45.750
Yeah. Every day's a parade.

21:46.583 --> 21:49.709
So, what was it like
being a famous model?

21:49.792 --> 21:53.458
Honestly, it was like any other job,
except the pay was great,

21:53.542 --> 21:55.166
the clothes were couture,

21:55.250 --> 21:57.750
and the parties were
just this side of Gomorrah.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.917
You don't know what Gomorrah means,
do you?

22:04.041 --> 22:05.709
Good.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.542
Did you know Kate Moss?

22:07.625 --> 22:10.458
- I invited her to a party once.
- Did you eat pizza with her?

22:10.542 --> 22:13.000
'Cause if you did, it's almost like
we ate pizza with her.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.083
Honey, most models don't eat pizza.

22:15.166 --> 22:18.083
Well, at least not without having
a finger for dessert.

22:19.041 --> 22:21.083
- Gross!
- Gross!

22:21.166 --> 22:23.208
I know, I never did that.

22:23.291 --> 22:25.667
You would not believe
the horrible things these girls did

22:25.750 --> 22:27.792
- to stay skinny.
- Like what?

22:27.875 --> 22:31.166
Well, some would smoke
those unfiltered French cigarettes.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.166
But cigarettes can kill you.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.625
But before they do,
they kill your appetite.

22:37.417 --> 22:42.375
One time, there was a girl
who took too many laxatives, and...

22:42.458 --> 22:47.250
If you're ever at the Chateau Milan
in Room 238, do not use the Jacuzzi.

22:48.542 --> 22:50.667
Do you have to be skinny
to be a model?

22:50.750 --> 22:53.083
Well, yeah. When's the last time
you saw a fat person

22:53.208 --> 22:54.750
on a magazine cover?

22:54.834 --> 22:57.583
Now, I'm gonna go talk to Vern
about our next session.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.041
You guys finish lunch,
so we can get back to work.

23:12.834 --> 23:15.125
Hi, Rupert. I went to the mall

23:15.208 --> 23:16.834
and bought a change of clothes
for the weekend,

23:16.917 --> 23:20.000
and while I was there
I got something for you.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.667
I thought you could wear it
on your day off.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.083
- Do you like it?
- Very much.

23:27.750 --> 23:32.041
It'll come in handy, should
my nationality ever slip my mind.

23:35.041 --> 23:37.583
That's good. You!

23:37.667 --> 23:39.750
I wanna party with you.

23:41.041 --> 23:43.250
Hey, I was thinking this afternoon

23:43.333 --> 23:44.792
maybe we could go
look for that drawer.

23:44.875 --> 23:46.125
I'm sorry, ma'am.

23:46.208 --> 23:47.917
I'm afraid
I have all this silver to polish.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.291
Well, let me help you and we can talk.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.709
There is so much
I want to know about you.

23:54.792 --> 23:58.667
Who is Rupert Cavanaugh?
What makes him tick?

24:02.166 --> 24:03.542
Tell you what.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.291
Let's go find you that drawer.

24:08.417 --> 24:10.625
Isn't the master bedroom
down that way?

24:10.709 --> 24:12.875
I realise it's a bit of a jaunt,

24:12.959 --> 24:15.792
but I managed to find you
an entire bureau.

24:15.875 --> 24:18.041
Oh, okay. Well...

24:18.125 --> 24:20.041
You certainly didn't have to go
to all that

24:21.375 --> 24:22.458
trouble.

24:22.959 --> 24:24.458
Is there a problem?

24:25.458 --> 24:27.709
No. I just...

24:28.208 --> 24:32.083
Well, all I really needed was
just a little, little drawer,

24:32.166 --> 24:34.625
and this is just so far away, and...

24:34.709 --> 24:38.583
- What is that smell?
- Oh, yes, about that.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.834
The cat passed away in this room.

24:42.917 --> 24:45.500
Did you consider removing the body?

24:45.583 --> 24:49.041
Well, if this isn't acceptable,
I can look elsewhere for a drawer,

24:49.125 --> 24:51.208
when I have the time.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.250
Why do you have to be this way?

24:55.041 --> 24:56.625
And what way is that?

24:56.709 --> 24:58.500
Listen, I know how you feel about Jane.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.667
But if you could just give me a chance.

25:00.750 --> 25:05.291
Come on, you can't possibly
hate me this much. Can you?

25:07.000 --> 25:10.208
- I'm done.
- Oh, fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.250
I don't need you to like me.

25:12.333 --> 25:14.792
But I think you should give me
just a little respect.

25:14.875 --> 25:18.583
- I am Ian's girlfriend.
- He's still married.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.291
At best, you're his mistress.

25:23.041 --> 25:26.333
Okay, you are not allowed
to call me that.

25:26.417 --> 25:29.542
Fine. What term would you prefer?

25:29.625 --> 25:34.041
Concubine? Consort?
Gold-digging whore?

25:35.208 --> 25:37.125
Oh, I'm so sorry.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.125
I shouldn't have done that.

25:39.208 --> 25:42.875
But, Rupert, you have to admit,
it's just a drawer.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.375
Those drawers are filled
with Jane's things.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.875
This is her house.

25:47.959 --> 25:52.375
You are a guest in her house,
and a temporary one at best.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.208
Okay, you know,
that is for Ian to decide.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.291
Oh, he has decided.

25:58.500 --> 26:01.041
Why do you think
he never told me about you?

26:01.125 --> 26:03.750
Why did he wait so long
to bring you here?

26:03.834 --> 26:06.417
He didn't want you in that room,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.625
where he still keeps Jane's things

26:09.709 --> 26:12.417
exactly as she left them.

26:17.208 --> 26:20.333
But I'll keep looking for that drawer.

26:30.125 --> 26:31.875
Hey, I'm going over to Mike's.

26:31.959 --> 26:34.125
I thought you were gonna
mow the lawn.

26:34.208 --> 26:37.166
I know. It's just that I promised
I'd help him install a shower bar.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.750
- And it could take a while.
- Okay.

26:44.959 --> 26:49.917
- T-Rex. How they hanging, brother?
- Low and lazy. Yeah.

26:50.750 --> 26:54.625
Hey, if Lynette asks?
I installed your shower bar today.

26:54.709 --> 26:56.166
You got it.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.709
- Vern, what are you doing here?
- We need to talk.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.083
Is it about the girls' makeup?

27:03.166 --> 27:04.917
'Cause I got them each
their own makeup kit,

27:05.000 --> 27:07.208
custom-tailored to match
their skin tone.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.667
And I got Melina some wax.
I know she's only 11,

27:09.750 --> 27:12.792
but those Greek genes are gonna
kick in any day now.

27:13.917 --> 27:15.083
- What?
- This morning

27:15.166 --> 27:17.291
Mrs Hayes caught Donna
with her finger down her throat

27:17.375 --> 27:19.208
trying to barf up her toaster waffle.

27:19.875 --> 27:21.000
Really?

27:21.083 --> 27:24.083
And Mrs Horowitz found
Isabel behind their garage, smoking.

27:24.166 --> 27:27.041
Apparently, she thought cigarettes
would help her lose a few pounds.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.041
Where do you think she got that idea?

27:30.834 --> 27:33.208
- Those damn tobacco companies.
- Gabby!

27:33.291 --> 27:37.333
Oh, fine, I may have told a few stories
about the old days, but as a warning.

27:37.417 --> 27:39.834
I didn't say anything
inappropriate for kids.

27:39.917 --> 27:43.291
Cassie Warren asked her mother
if she could throw a Gomorrah party.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.875
Okay, look, we have to do
damage control. I get it.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.583
Next session,
I'll apologise to all the moms.

27:49.667 --> 27:52.709
There's not gonna be a next session
for you.

27:52.792 --> 27:56.083
The moms don't want you anywhere
near their daughters.

27:56.166 --> 27:59.542
But I'm helping them! They love me!

27:59.625 --> 28:02.625
Wait, please, Vern, you have to
give me a chance to fix this!

28:02.709 --> 28:06.291
It's too late, Gabby.
You are now officially a bad influence.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.375
Well, see you at spin class.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.250
<i>All right, let's turn out the lights.</i>

28:18.333 --> 28:21.250
<i>They called the race</i>
<i>on account of darkness.</i>

28:22.333 --> 28:24.375
Mom said we couldn't leave.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.625
I'm just going out front.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.291
What the hell is that?

28:33.375 --> 28:36.250
Stop running the ball!

28:37.458 --> 28:39.750
Can I ask you guys something?

28:40.333 --> 28:43.166
What was I like before the accident?

28:43.834 --> 28:46.500
- What do you mean?
- I mean, what kind of guy was I?

28:46.583 --> 28:48.709
Was I happy, was I angry?

28:50.083 --> 28:52.625
Did I ever get violent?

28:55.709 --> 28:57.250
You were fine.

29:01.750 --> 29:04.375
Look, I'm serious.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.166
I really need to know.

29:07.250 --> 29:10.166
You can be honest.
You're my best friend.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.750
Honestly?

29:16.542 --> 29:19.875
You were sort of mysterious.
Kept to yourself.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.792
Nobody really knew you all that well.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.208
Yeah.

29:24.834 --> 29:27.333
And this is coming
from your best friend.

29:34.959 --> 29:37.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah! Yes!

29:43.542 --> 29:46.500
I'm sorry, guys. I just...

29:46.583 --> 29:49.250
I guess I was really tired.

29:49.959 --> 29:52.500
- Where's your brother?
- He went outside.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.875
Yeah.

29:56.041 --> 30:00.208
Okay. Watch her, watch her.
I'll be back. I'll be right back.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.667
Hello! Open up, open the door!

30:04.458 --> 30:06.125
Lynette, what's the matter?

30:06.208 --> 30:08.166
- I want my son.
- He's not here.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.625
He's not in our house,
he's not in our yard.

30:10.709 --> 30:13.667
Do not jerk me around. Parker!

30:13.750 --> 30:16.500
You can't just barge
into my house like this, Lynette.

30:16.583 --> 30:20.625
Don't play dumb with me.
I know exactly what is down here!

30:23.333 --> 30:25.792
Where's the pinball?
Where's all the games?

30:25.875 --> 30:29.834
That was a collection I was taking up
for the children's hospital.

30:30.875 --> 30:33.458
I delivered everything yesterday.

30:35.625 --> 30:38.291
Did you donate the photos, too?

30:41.375 --> 30:43.250
Parker!

30:45.834 --> 30:47.834
What exactly is it
you're accusing me of?

30:47.917 --> 30:50.625
Don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police.

30:50.709 --> 30:53.000
- Parker!
- Is there a problem?

30:53.500 --> 30:57.291
You're damn right there's a problem.
I can't find my son.

30:57.834 --> 30:59.792
Isn't that your son?

31:10.125 --> 31:11.291
Hey! Hey!

31:12.166 --> 31:15.709
- Where have you been?
- We were at Mike's.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.667
He wandered over looking for me.
What's going on?

31:31.125 --> 31:34.959
Well, that was the children's hospital.

31:35.041 --> 31:37.208
Art's story checks out.

31:37.291 --> 31:39.083
He donated all that stuff.

31:40.959 --> 31:42.208
That proves nothing.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.375
He knew I was on to him.
He had to dump it.

31:44.458 --> 31:46.500
Honey, believe me, I am with you.

31:46.583 --> 31:48.375
There is something fishy
about this guy,

31:48.458 --> 31:49.792
but you got to get a grip.

31:49.875 --> 31:52.041
You can't go
barging into people's homes.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.959
- What if Parker had been in there?
- But he wasn't.

31:55.041 --> 32:00.250
And if you keep accusing this guy
without proof, he can sue us.

32:03.625 --> 32:08.667
Listen, I've been thinking that after
everything that you've been through...

32:08.750 --> 32:10.625
Please don't bring up
the supermarket again.

32:10.709 --> 32:12.917
That was a traumatic experience.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.458
I think it's affected you
more than you realise.

32:19.959 --> 32:23.250
And maybe you need to talk
to somebody about it.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.250
Like a therapist.

32:30.333 --> 32:33.375
You're right. I need to talk to someone.

32:35.375 --> 32:37.709
He'd gotten rid of everything.

32:37.792 --> 32:41.500
The toys, the pictures,
everything was gone.

32:43.709 --> 32:46.583
- You can't sit on this, Lynette.
- I know.

32:47.208 --> 32:51.750
If something happened to someone's
kid because I kept my mouth shut...

32:53.000 --> 32:56.083
The thing is,
I promised Tom I'd back off.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.709
Well, I didn't.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.375
Jane has some beautiful things.

33:19.458 --> 33:23.291
Yes, she's always had
impeccable taste.

33:26.542 --> 33:31.458
I know how it must seem to you,
my holding on to them.

33:32.208 --> 33:34.792
But I just couldn't bring myself to...

33:34.875 --> 33:36.166
I get it.

33:37.792 --> 33:42.542
As much as I have tried to pretend
that it's just you and me,

33:43.875 --> 33:46.166
there's three of us in this relationship.

33:46.250 --> 33:50.166
- Susan, you know I adore you.
- No, please listen.

33:51.542 --> 33:53.250
The last couple of months,

33:53.333 --> 33:57.041
I thought we've gotten really close,
and I've been loving that.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.667
I just feel like, lately,

33:59.750 --> 34:03.458
there's this limit
to how far you'll let me in.

34:05.250 --> 34:07.125
Well, I'm trying.

34:07.208 --> 34:10.792
It's just the more
I let you into my heart,

34:10.875 --> 34:13.917
the more I feel
I'm pushing Jane out, and...

34:14.000 --> 34:17.750
You don't have to push Jane out
to let me in.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.542
Of course, you're right.

34:28.291 --> 34:30.959
- Do you know what I think?
- No.

34:31.041 --> 34:33.250
That kind of compassionate wisdom

34:33.333 --> 34:36.333
deserves an obscenely
expensive meal.

34:37.417 --> 34:41.625
Okay, well, give me a minute
and I will change into something nice.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.417
Rupert still hasn't found you a drawer?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.208
No, not just yet.

34:48.375 --> 34:51.000
Well, in that case...

34:55.208 --> 34:57.583
Ian, you don't have to do that.

34:58.583 --> 35:01.000
If I can make room in my heart
for both of you,

35:01.083 --> 35:03.583
I can certainly make room
in my bureau.

35:09.458 --> 35:12.333
It's just not right.
Your mother skipped lunch, too.

35:12.417 --> 35:16.083
She said she wasn't hungry.
Can't we just revel in her absence?

35:16.166 --> 35:19.250
I know she's a handful,
but she deserves some compassion.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.000
The woman watched
a dream die yesterday.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.583
We all did.

35:25.333 --> 35:28.917
- I'm taking her dinner up.
- Oh, it's okay. I'll do it.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.750
No, no, I'd rather do it myself.
I want to talk to her.

35:31.834 --> 35:34.375
Oh, well, I'll let her know
you're coming.

35:38.875 --> 35:42.458
- Mom's coming. Ditch the wine.
- Very well.

35:42.542 --> 35:45.166
You finished the whole bottle already?

35:45.250 --> 35:48.667
- I was thirsty.
- Gloria, I've been thinking, and...

35:48.750 --> 35:51.375
Does no one in this house
ever bother to knock?

35:51.458 --> 35:53.208
Is that alcohol?

35:53.291 --> 35:55.208
Where did you get that?

35:57.166 --> 35:58.458
Andrew!

35:58.917 --> 36:03.125
When my grandma asks me a favour,
with tears in her eyes, how can...

36:03.208 --> 36:05.500
Oh, shut up, you little extortionist.

36:05.583 --> 36:08.959
He charged me 20 bucks,
plus five for the corkscrew!

36:09.041 --> 36:13.583
- I'll deal with you later.
- You can kiss that codeine goodbye.

36:16.625 --> 36:19.792
- Andrew brought her wine.
- Oh, for God's sake.

36:20.458 --> 36:22.041
This is our house.

36:22.125 --> 36:24.208
If you expect to stay here,
you're going to learn

36:24.291 --> 36:26.333
to obey a few rules.

36:26.417 --> 36:30.500
- I don't obey rules. I make them!
- Not any more, Mother.

36:30.583 --> 36:34.166
Just watch yourself, sonny boy!

36:34.250 --> 36:37.458
Okay, look. I know you're upset,
but don't blame Orson.

36:37.542 --> 36:40.792
- It's not his fault.
- It's all his fault!

36:41.500 --> 36:43.709
You think he's so wonderful.

36:43.792 --> 36:46.083
You don't know
the half of what he's done.

36:46.166 --> 36:49.583
Let's go. I can't deal with her
when she's like this.

36:49.667 --> 36:53.792
He doesn't want you to hear the truth.
How he cheated on Alma!

36:54.125 --> 36:57.291
- What?
- She's drunk!

36:57.375 --> 36:59.834
How he broke her heart, and mine!

36:59.917 --> 37:02.250
All for his precious Monique!

37:02.333 --> 37:04.000
You shut up, Mother!

37:04.083 --> 37:07.917
Monique Polier? I thought that was
Harvey Bigsby's mistress.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.208
Oh, she got around, that girl!

37:11.291 --> 37:13.625
See, I told you.
I told you she would do this!

37:13.709 --> 37:15.792
There he was, cheating on Alma,

37:15.875 --> 37:19.500
not knowing all the time
his whore was cheating on him.

37:19.583 --> 37:21.750
Stop it! You shut your evil mouth!

37:21.834 --> 37:23.166
Or what?

37:23.250 --> 37:27.375
What are you gonna do to me
that hasn't already been done?

37:36.583 --> 37:39.875
Bree. Bree. Bree, no.

37:41.166 --> 37:44.208
Bree, wait! Bree!

38:12.583 --> 38:14.959
...had the cutest outfit today!

38:15.041 --> 38:17.291
I know. I saw it. It was so adorable.

38:17.375 --> 38:19.667
- The skirt...
- I know.

38:21.625 --> 38:24.333
- Miss Gabrielle!
- Gabrielle!

38:24.417 --> 38:26.000
What is she doing here?

38:26.083 --> 38:28.792
I have no idea.
I told her she was banned.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.834
Okay, just give me a minute.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.583
I'm sorry about what I said to the girls.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.458
- And it won't happen again.
- Damn right.

38:37.542 --> 38:40.208
You're not going anywhere
near our girls.

38:40.291 --> 38:43.417
- Can't you give me a second chance?
- Why should we?

38:43.500 --> 38:46.250
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here
all clickety-clack,

38:46.333 --> 38:49.959
perfect Little Miss Size Zero,
thinking you're all better than us.

38:50.041 --> 38:53.583
We all saw the look on your face
when you showed up.

38:54.250 --> 38:57.625
I don't think I'm better than you.
Hell, I envy you.

38:57.709 --> 39:00.667
- Please.
- No, it's true.

39:00.750 --> 39:05.458
You have husbands and families and
a reason to wake up in the morning.

39:05.542 --> 39:08.166
What do I have? Him!

39:09.625 --> 39:12.792
Teaching your kids about
confidence and beauty

39:12.875 --> 39:17.083
is the most useful thing I've done
since, I don't know when.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.917
And as much as I've helped them,

39:23.583 --> 39:26.000
they've helped me so much more.

39:28.375 --> 39:30.542
So please, I need this.

39:34.667 --> 39:38.583
And I promise, no more talk about
dodgy weight-loss methods.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.417
Like the highly-effective,
non-FDA-approved diet pill

39:45.500 --> 39:48.291
I can get from my friends in Zurich,

39:49.166 --> 39:50.959
in bulk.

39:54.375 --> 39:57.250
Well, I suppose the Christian thing
would be to forgive her.

40:01.417 --> 40:03.542
Well, why don't you ladies talk it over

40:03.625 --> 40:06.583
and I'm gonna work on posture
with the girls.

40:06.709 --> 40:09.625
- Yeah! Come on.
- Come on, you guys, let's go!

40:09.709 --> 40:11.625
Yes!

40:17.792 --> 40:20.250
Oh, thank God.

40:20.333 --> 40:23.875
I've been driving around all night,
looking for you.

40:24.667 --> 40:27.709
We saw that woman at the morgue

40:28.166 --> 40:30.125
on our wedding night.

40:31.917 --> 40:35.792
- You pretended not to know her.
- Bree, I can explain.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.709
No. I'm done.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.625
You don't understand what happened.

40:41.709 --> 40:43.875
There were two women in your life
before me.

40:43.959 --> 40:47.875
One vanished, and the other was killed.
That's all I need to understand.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.834
I've packed some of your things.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.875
I want you out of the house.

40:57.750 --> 40:58.917
Now.

41:01.834 --> 41:04.709
Bree, please.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.792
I love you.

41:08.542 --> 41:10.041
I know.

41:10.500 --> 41:13.041
But it scares the hell out of me.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.834
<i>Dangerous men walk among us.</i>

41:26.917 --> 41:32.375
<i>And we can't always be sure of who</i>
<i>they are or what secrets they hide.</i>

41:33.709 --> 41:37.125
<i>But once our worst suspicions</i>
<i>are confirmed,</i>

41:38.542 --> 41:40.834
<i>we can take action.</i>

41:43.417 --> 41:46.333
<i>Once their agendas are revealed,</i>

41:47.458 --> 41:51.875
<i>we can take steps to protect ourselves</i>

41:52.542 --> 41:54.959
<i>and those we love.</i>

42:04.542 --> 42:09.458
<i>Yes, dangerous men can cause</i>
