WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.275
[crowd cheering]

00:13.213 --> 00:14.748
[Tiki] It's called the Beast.

00:14.814 --> 00:16.616
[Chris] That was unbelievable!

00:16.683 --> 00:19.486
It's an obstacle course
of mythic proportions.

00:19.552 --> 00:21.488
[Gilles in French] Magnificent.

00:21.554 --> 00:23.423
The most physically demanding...

00:23.490 --> 00:24.691
[Tiki] Oh, no!

00:24.758 --> 00:28.294
[Chris] ...and mentally-challenging test
of all time.

00:32.399 --> 00:38.571
108 athletes from six different countries
have all converged right here.

00:41.941 --> 00:44.711
There is no obstacle
that has ever defeated me.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.347
[Arianna in Italian]
Am I afraid of the Beast?

00:47.414 --> 00:49.149
No. I am the Beast.

00:49.482 --> 00:52.218
[in French] Nothing can stop me.
I'll be here until the very end.

00:52.852 --> 00:54.354
[in Chinese] I'm unstoppable.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.192
[Tiki] We've got five new countries
with their hosts.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.293
[cheering]

01:00.360 --> 01:02.462
[Chris] This 650-ton super predator...

01:03.263 --> 01:04.330
[screams]

01:04.397 --> 01:06.733
has gotten even more aggressive
than before.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.036
To survive, these athletes
are gonna need the perfect combination

01:10.103 --> 01:11.738
of strength...

01:11.805 --> 01:12.772
[in Chinese] Power.

01:13.173 --> 01:14.541
[in French] Endurance...

01:14.941 --> 01:15.842
[in Hindi] Courage.

01:16.509 --> 01:17.610
[in Spanish] Heart.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.648
[in Italian] My question is,
how do you tame this Beast?

01:21.714 --> 01:22.949
[Tiki] Wow.

01:24.050 --> 01:27.887
Get ready for the greatest evolution
in athletic competition.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.556
[Chris and Tiki] USA!

01:29.622 --> 01:31.558
Team USA is gonna win.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.892
[woman whoops]

01:32.959 --> 01:34.761
[in Chinese] The Chinese team will win.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.129
[Paula] Go, Spain!

01:36.196 --> 01:37.997
The Spanish will give it their all.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.567
[both in Italian] It will be Italy!

01:42.168 --> 01:43.703
[in Hindi] Team India will win!

01:43.770 --> 01:44.838
[in French] Well done!

01:44.904 --> 01:46.973
The French athletes are ready.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.541
[all] This is the...

01:48.608 --> 01:51.444
[all] Ultimate Beast--

01:51.511 --> 01:52.946
Ultimate Beastmaster.

[crowd cheering]

02:14.100 --> 02:17.604
[Tiki] Just when you thought
it was safe to go outside,

02:17.670 --> 02:20.440
it's back and badder than ever.

02:20.507 --> 02:24.177
Hello, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber
and with me is Chris Distefano.

02:24.244 --> 02:27.614
Welcome to Season 2
of the Ultimate Beastmaster.

02:27.680 --> 02:30.183
[Chris] This thing,
it's not from around here.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.786
It's like a Transformer and Godzilla
had a baby or something.

02:34.220 --> 02:38.057
[Tiki] Tonight, 108 athletes
from around the world -

02:38.124 --> 02:42.295
we're talking about climbing champions,
parkour stars, professional fighters,

02:42.362 --> 02:43.429
even Olympians,

02:43.496 --> 02:49.102
have come here to take on the nastiest
obstacle course competition ever devised.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.771
We've got five new countries
with their hosts.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.473
Let's quickly introduce them.

02:53.773 --> 02:57.177
-Hello. I'm Sandy Heribert.
-Hi, I'm Gilles Marini.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.945
[both] Go, France!

02:59.846 --> 03:01.681
For Spain are Saúl Craviotto.

03:01.748 --> 03:02.949
[in Spanish] And Paula Vázquez.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.286
The gorgeous Bianca Balti!

03:06.352 --> 03:08.721
And the ever funny
Francesco Facchinetti!

03:08.788 --> 03:10.256
[both chanting] Italy! Italy!

03:10.323 --> 03:13.927
USA! Chris Distefano, Tiki Barber.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.296
Your Chinese host, Bin Gu.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.232
-Hi, everyone. I'm Qinyi Du.
-How is everyone doing?

03:19.599 --> 03:23.069
-I'm Sarah-Jane Dias.
-And I'm Vidyut Jammwal.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.138
[both in English] Go, India!

03:26.372 --> 03:29.008
[Tiki] It's game on!
So let's break it down on how it works.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.512
In each episode, twelve athletes -
two from each country -

03:32.579 --> 03:34.681
will battle it out inside the Beast.

03:34.747 --> 03:38.151
This plays out kind of like
a live-action video game.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.954
There are four levels,
each one harder than the last.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.224
The farther they get,
the more points they earn,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.726
furthering their opportunity to advance.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.061
And at the end of the night,

03:48.127 --> 03:50.463
the person
with the highest number of points

03:50.530 --> 03:55.969
will earn $10,000
and be crowned a Beastmaster.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.806
The winner of each episode will face off
against all the other winners

03:59.872 --> 04:02.675
on the final night of
our big championship round

04:02.742 --> 04:07.614
for a chance to win
the grand prize of $50,000

04:07.680 --> 04:11.618
and the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

04:12.185 --> 04:16.022
[all chanting] Go, go, go! Go, go, go!

04:16.089 --> 04:19.524
[Chris] Let's take a look at both athletes
representing the US tonight.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.629
[Tiki] Here's Jessica Hill,
a single mom and professional acrobat.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.497
Thanks to her insane agility,

04:24.564 --> 04:27.300
she's hoping
to Cirque du Soleil the Beast.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.103
I just spent the last year working
for Le Rêve in Las Vegas.

04:30.169 --> 04:31.037
It's a water show.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.474
I think my background as a gymnast
and acrobat is gonna help me.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.744
For one, I'm strong,
and I'm pretty fearless.

04:38.144 --> 04:42.415
I don't take no for an answer,
and I'm not going to stop until I win.

04:42.482 --> 04:45.084
[Tiki] Felix Chu is a full-time
obstacle course racer

04:45.151 --> 04:47.186
who put his money where his mouth is.

04:47.253 --> 04:50.189
He quit a six-figure job
to focus on racing.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.458
I am dedicated
to training for obstacle courses.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.894
From a fitness standpoint,

04:54.961 --> 04:59.098
my strength, my power, my body awareness
are all at their highest levels ever.

04:59.165 --> 05:00.933
I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.304
[Chris] Our first 12 competitors
are gearing up

05:04.370 --> 05:06.005
and they are about to face Level 1.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.007
Let's look
at what they'll have to conquer,

05:08.074 --> 05:10.343
starting inside the smelly mouth
of the Beast.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.280
First,
the competitors will have to two-step

05:14.347 --> 05:17.183
their way up the steep gangway
of Bite Force,

05:17.250 --> 05:21.988
jump like jackrabbits through the Grinder,
hang on for dear life in the Faceplant

05:22.055 --> 05:24.891
and leap for their lives
on the Energy Coils.

05:24.957 --> 05:27.960
From there, they'll swing their way
through the Dead Bolts.

05:28.027 --> 05:29.862
[Tiki] If they survive,

05:29.929 --> 05:33.633
they'll have to stick it out
past the Mag Wall to the final platform.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.937
[Chris] This season, all obstacles
are worth five points each.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.840
There are three Point Thrusters
scattered across the level,

05:40.907 --> 05:42.608
and they're risky and out of the way.

05:42.675 --> 05:45.545
But if a competitor
successfully touches one,

05:45.611 --> 05:48.748
they will be rewarded
with ten extra points.

05:49.382 --> 05:52.852
-You're ready, man. You're caped out.
-Hell yes. You know it.

05:57.223 --> 06:02.195
[Tiki] Our first competitor tonight,
parkour expert, Dong Li from China.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.730
[Qinyi] You can do it!

06:04.397 --> 06:05.865
-Go!
-[Tiki] They have a panda.

06:05.932 --> 06:07.734
-I want to pet the panda.
-Panda.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.302
[both] Panda, panda, panda.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.839
[Chris] The first obstacle of the Beast
is the Bite Force.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.240
[Tiki] Bite Force is a bit tricky

06:14.307 --> 06:17.110
because that ramp is on a 30-degree angle,
left to right.

06:17.677 --> 06:18.578
There we go.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.879
On to Grinder.

06:19.946 --> 06:21.214
[Qinyi cheering]

06:21.280 --> 06:23.950
-Go, go, go!
-Yeah!

06:24.283 --> 06:26.419
[Tiki] This is a 7.5-foot jump.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.088
Unbelievable! He jumps like a grasshopper!

06:29.155 --> 06:31.391
[Tiki] Dong Li is having zero problems.

06:31.457 --> 06:32.925
-[Chris] Wow.
-[Tiki] Impressive.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.428
-[Bin] He's in good form.
-Let's dance.

06:36.963 --> 06:37.997
Stay focused.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.432
[Tiki] On to the Faceplant.

06:39.499 --> 06:42.468
This is hard. You gotta hold on
with your hands on the side.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.538
Look at his eyes. He's looking down.
You better look forward.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.307
-Looking down ain't gonna help.
-[Chris] Face your fears, my friend.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.209
Okay, here we go.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.181
[Tiki] He's on to the first Energy Coil,
adding five more points.

06:55.248 --> 06:58.184
Now you got a strategy question
that all competitors face.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.854
Do you go for the Thruster?
The Thrusters are an extra ten points.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.190
The distance here is about 12 feet.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.426
[Chris] He's going for the Thruster.
Impressive.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.261
[Tiki] Now, the problem is he's 5'6".

07:08.327 --> 07:10.596
Dong Li, throw your shoe at it.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.465
[both] Throw your shoe.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.133
[Qinyi] Dong Li! Dong Li!

07:14.200 --> 07:15.601
-Throw your shoe!
-[scoffs]

07:16.002 --> 07:18.571
-Your shoe!
-[Bin] Use your shoe!

07:19.539 --> 07:20.373
[Tiki] He got it.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.607
-That was great!
-Nice!

07:21.674 --> 07:22.909
[Tiki] Here's the problem.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.579
He's gotta go back the way he just came
in order to go forward.

07:27.013 --> 07:30.683
-Easy jump. Easy jump back for Dong Li.
-[Chris] Wow.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.752
[Tiki] He's very confident.

07:33.052 --> 07:36.522
[Chris] Dong Li, wasting no time.
Not letting the Beast get into his mind.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.625
[Tiki] He's not thinking.
He's a little exhausted here, though.

07:40.226 --> 07:43.262
He's spending a lot of energy
to go get that Thruster.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.932
Last one. Very easily.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.503
Just using his time. Biding his time.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.271
[Chris] Dong's taking a seat!

07:53.039 --> 07:54.907
[Tiki] He's smiling, man.
He's loving this.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.043
He's enjoying the view. Hey, take it in.

07:57.109 --> 08:00.046
You're inside the belly of the Beast.
You might as well look around.

08:00.112 --> 08:02.048
[Tiki] Let's see how he moves
to the Dead Bolts.

08:02.114 --> 08:06.552
[Chris] When he was younger,
Dong broke his left arm twice in one year,

08:06.619 --> 08:07.687
and almost lost it.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.322
We'll see if it affects him here.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.893
[Tiki] Five points for each obstacle.
Easily to the second Dead Bolt.

08:14.961 --> 08:18.831
He's going to have to decide whether to go
for the Point Thruster using his feet.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.934
Chris] What is he gonna do?
Hang upside down?

08:22.668 --> 08:23.703
Oh, wow.

08:23.769 --> 08:26.005
[Tiki] Impressive.
That's all core strength.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.740
Chinese monkey.

08:27.807 --> 08:29.942
Chinese monkey.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.611
[Tiki] He's gotta turn around
and get his momentum going.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.047
Now, he passed up the Point Thruster.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.750
-Can Dong Li get to the last of the bolts?
-[Chris] Come on, Dong!

08:38.284 --> 08:39.118
Let's see.

08:39.184 --> 08:40.886
[Tiki] This is a long jump
for a short man.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.054
-The longest jump of the Dead Bolts.
-[both exclaim]

08:43.121 --> 08:43.956
Yes!

08:44.023 --> 08:45.925
-Dong!
-That was tight. That was close.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.159
Dong-Dong-Dong-Dong!

08:47.226 --> 08:49.161
[Tiki] I thought
he was gonna lose his grip.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.430
-What? He's--
-Yeah! Oh, no.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.266
[Tiki] He just missed the Mag Wall.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.268
-Just missed the Mag Wall.
-Hey!

08:55.334 --> 08:57.537
You wonder if all of that time hanging

08:58.004 --> 09:01.040
just made his fingers
a little bit too tired.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.442
[Chris] Very impressive by Dong Li.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.978
[in Chinese] I should have grabbed
the highest handhold.

09:06.145 --> 09:09.649
The second one was too slippery for me.

09:09.882 --> 09:14.153
[Tiki] Dong Li scored 80 points.
Remember, points are everything.

09:14.220 --> 09:18.991
The top eight scores move on to Level 2,
and the points are also cumulative,

09:19.058 --> 09:21.894
so as you advance,
you take your points with you.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.132
[Chris] Next up, parkour expert,
Alex Segura from Spain.

09:32.471 --> 09:35.141
[Alex in Spanish] I started practicing
parkour ten years ago.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.945
In 2011, I suffered a very serious injury.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.114
I fractured five metatarsal bones
in my left foot,

09:42.181 --> 09:43.716
four of which were displaced.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.118
So I was unable to practice what I love.

09:46.552 --> 09:48.321
It was really horrible.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.023
But even with the cast on, I trained.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.661
Despite being lame in one foot,
I climbed walls, fences, whatever I could.

09:57.229 --> 10:01.500
I would really love to win
and show the whole world what I've got,

10:01.567 --> 10:03.603
all my training
and the effort I've put in.

10:06.639 --> 10:07.940
[Chris] Okay, here we go.

10:08.007 --> 10:11.911
♪ Alex is so cool!
He deserves a big hurrah! ♪

10:12.345 --> 10:14.013
[Chris] He went up the mouth quick.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.182
[Tiki] Through Bite Force
with no trouble at all.

10:16.649 --> 10:17.783
On to Grinder.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.253
-He is struggling.
-[Chris] He is. I didn't expect this.

10:22.888 --> 10:26.058
He kind of twisted around,
but now he's got it.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.095
[Tiki] All he's got to do
is land these 7.5-foot jumps.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.630
There he goes. And he gets it.

10:30.997 --> 10:34.100
Making his way through the Grinder
in pretty quick time.

10:34.400 --> 10:38.504
Don't know what happened in the beginning,
but he easily moves through to Faceplant.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.044
This is all about core strength.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.413
More importantly, this is confidence.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.583
You've got to hold on to that chain,
but you've gotta grab it high.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.753
-Come on! Come on!
-Come on!

10:53.819 --> 10:54.720
No! No!

10:54.787 --> 10:56.255
-Come on! Please!
-No! No!

10:56.322 --> 10:58.524
Swing! Swing! Swing!

10:58.591 --> 10:59.792
Do the scissor swing!

10:59.859 --> 11:01.827
-That's it!
-Yes!

11:03.162 --> 11:07.099
[Tiki] To the Energy Coils. It looks like
he is going for the Point Thruster.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.437
The Thrusters are an extra ten points.
It's not about time, it's about points.

11:11.971 --> 11:14.040
-Just barely hung on.
-[Chris] Wow.

11:14.106 --> 11:15.408
[Tiki] That was close.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.910
He clung on with his pinkie.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.178
Get those ten points!

11:19.245 --> 11:21.914
-He's brushing it with his fingers.
-Use your foot!

11:21.981 --> 11:23.883
He didn't have to use his foot.

11:23.949 --> 11:25.117
[Tiki] Here's the hard part.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.687
That original Energy Coil
is actually higher.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.555
So to jump back, you have to jump up.

11:29.622 --> 11:32.658
It's not getting there that's the problem.
It's getting back.

11:32.925 --> 11:34.660
Oh, no! [groans]

11:34.727 --> 11:36.295
[Paula] No, no, no, no!

11:38.197 --> 11:39.565
[Paula groans]

11:39.999 --> 11:43.803
[Tiki] The gamble was worth it.
He did get the Thruster for ten points,

11:43.869 --> 11:46.706
-but can't make it back.
-[Chris] Look, he thrusted, right?

11:46.772 --> 11:49.575
[Tiki] You know what? He just missed.
He just missed the landing.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.145
[Chris] And with that,
Alex ends with 50 points.

11:53.913 --> 11:56.482
He's in second place, out of two.

11:56.549 --> 11:57.950
But that's good.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.986
And he's 30 points behind the leader,
Dong Li of China.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.727
[Tiki] Next up, we have an Olympic boxer
from India, Vikas Yadav.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.363
[Vikas] I'm the youngest to get
a gold medal in the Asian Games.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.631
I was 18 at the time.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.335
[in Hindi] My ultimate dream
is to win the gold medal for India

12:16.402 --> 12:17.369
at the Tokyo Olympics.

12:18.637 --> 12:19.472
[Tiki] There he goes.

12:19.538 --> 12:23.843
As he gets onto the Grinder, I'm trying
to think what skill a boxer would have

12:24.210 --> 12:26.912
that's going to aid him against the Beast.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.013
[Chris] Fearlessness.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.715
[Tiki] That might be the one--

12:29.782 --> 12:32.985
[Chris] You've got to be fearless
if your job is to get punched in the face.

12:33.052 --> 12:36.822
[Tiki] That's true.
Easily to the second of the Grinders.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.458
One more short jump.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.896
-Very good. He did very well.
-Yes!

12:44.530 --> 12:45.898
[Tiki] Next up, Faceplant.

12:46.365 --> 12:49.335
He's already got 25 points.
Let's see what he can add here.

12:51.637 --> 12:54.173
The Faceplant has been pretty tame--
[groans]

12:55.708 --> 12:58.244
-Oh, man, he's down!
-[Chris] His face went into the blood.

12:58.310 --> 12:59.378
Oh, no.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.747
I was expecting more from him, Sarah.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.749
With the training they have to do,

13:03.816 --> 13:06.452
I think he could have performed
much better.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.422
[Tiki] Jeez!

13:11.123 --> 13:15.528
Next, three-time French climbing champ,
Bassa Mawem, from France.

13:15.594 --> 13:18.230
His brother Mickaël,
he's competing tonight, too.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.598
[in French] Come on, Bassa! Go!

13:23.969 --> 13:26.472
[in French]
I'm a professional speed climber.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.142
And I'm a professional boulderer.

13:31.977 --> 13:36.182
When we train together,
we always want to beat each other.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.818
It's impossible, but I can dream!

13:38.884 --> 13:40.586
[Bassa] As a family, we help each other,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.855
and we're always there
to support each other.

13:42.922 --> 13:46.559
So if he wins, I win too.
And if I win, he wins too.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.861
[Mickaël] The Mawem brothers
are taking on the Beast.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.462
[Bassa] And we're going to smash it.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.201
[Tiki] Bassa Mawem,
taking on the Faceplant.

13:55.634 --> 13:58.337
Now the thing with the Faceplant,
this thing takes core strength.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.840
This contraption leans forward.

14:01.273 --> 14:04.743
If you don't squat,
you don't tighten your core,

14:04.810 --> 14:06.745
you can easily fall off of this thing.

14:07.613 --> 14:12.618
This is where it gets hard. This jump--
Oh, wow! What a leap!

14:14.553 --> 14:17.323
Now he's up to 35
as he's on the first Energy Coil.

14:17.389 --> 14:19.091
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:19.158 --> 14:20.059
[in English] Just saying...

14:20.125 --> 14:22.628
-Just saying...
-[in English] Hello, there!

14:22.695 --> 14:25.764
There is a French guy, too,
who's busting our balls!

14:25.831 --> 14:29.134
-He's busting our balls!
-It's the same old story...

14:29.201 --> 14:31.303
[Bianca] Italy versus France.

14:33.472 --> 14:35.107
[Tiki] Here we go. Oh! He gets it.

14:36.408 --> 14:37.843
You're doing well!

14:40.346 --> 14:44.216
[Tiki] Oh! He makes it.
Doing it for his family, for his brother.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.685
He is also a brother,
but he's doing it for his brother.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.355
Look at that skill and how focused he is.

14:49.421 --> 14:52.424
He's a professional climber,
so clearly he has an advantage.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.962
[Tiki] He's swinging on the Dead Bolts.
Now, you worry about the Dead Bolts.

14:57.029 --> 15:01.166
He hits the Thruster opportunity there,
so ten extra points for him.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.103
But you worry about the taller guys
on these Dead Bolts

15:04.169 --> 15:08.440
because if they hang too long,
that's a lot of weight going downward.

15:08.507 --> 15:13.212
[Chris] Grip strength, to me, is the most
important part of this competition.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.948
[Tiki] That's not bunk science or BS.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.817
Chris actually has a PhD
in Physical Therapy.

15:18.884 --> 15:22.755
[Chris] True. But my grip is too weak
to hold on to a job, so I became a comic.

15:23.822 --> 15:25.824
-[Tiki and Chris] Oh!
-[Tiki] He makes it.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.162
[French supporter] Go!

15:30.229 --> 15:32.464
[Tiki] Oh, he makes it. Wow!

15:32.798 --> 15:35.501
We've got our first competitor
to the Mag Wall.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.237
Now, those things fall off
every two seconds.

15:38.304 --> 15:42.508
Each one of those orange lines he passes
adds another five points to his total.

15:42.574 --> 15:47.813
He hit another Thruster, but could we
get the first ever to finish Level 1?

15:49.048 --> 15:50.316
Come on, Bassa!

15:51.383 --> 15:54.820
-Bassa easily on to the final platform!
-[Chris] Bassa!

15:54.887 --> 15:56.055
[Tiki] He finishes Level 1.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.224
We're just so excited!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.026
-Good for you!
-Good job, Bassa!

16:01.093 --> 16:03.796
-[in English] Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

16:04.596 --> 16:06.699
Thank you, China!

16:07.333 --> 16:09.201
[crowd cheering]

16:10.069 --> 16:11.070
[man] Bassa!

16:20.813 --> 16:21.947
Great scores.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.649
The day you were born,

16:23.716 --> 16:27.553
God said, "Let's make a boulder,
and let's make Bassa."

16:30.022 --> 16:32.658
[Tiki] Let's look at the highlights
of five more competitors

16:32.725 --> 16:34.727
aiming to bring down the Beast.

16:36.528 --> 16:40.065
Cirque du Soleil acrobat Jessica Hill
from Team USA.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.368
As a shorter person,
you better have some explosion.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.535
[Tiki] Her aerial ability...

16:43.602 --> 16:46.472
-Here we go. She grabs on. Oh!
-[Tiki] ...it wasn't enough.

16:46.538 --> 16:48.841
The seven-foot jump sent her tumbling.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.845
Five-foot-two-inch Spanish
obstacle course racer, Lorena González,

16:52.911 --> 16:56.015
and five-foot-four-inch
Chinese climber, Dan Zeng,

16:56.482 --> 16:57.883
both got to the Grinder

16:58.250 --> 17:00.853
and discovered size matters.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.055
[commentators groan]

17:03.455 --> 17:06.492
They did great.

17:06.558 --> 17:10.329
[Tiki] Indian powerlifter,
Vishwanath Bhaskar,

17:10.396 --> 17:14.599
and Italian Taekwondo champion,
Gianni Guglielmo...

17:14.665 --> 17:16.935
[both chanting] Italy! Italy!

17:17.502 --> 17:20.873
[Tiki] ...flew through the Grinder
and easily made it to the Energy Coils.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.342
[Chris] There he is.
He's got no problem with this.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.743
Right now, his only problem
is his ponytail.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.180
[Tiki] Both were tempted
by the first Point Thruster.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.149
Vishwanath went for it.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.851
[Chris] The Beast may be in the mood
for some Indian right now.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.086
Oh, no! Oh, no!

17:34.153 --> 17:35.554
[Tiki] But it was a slip and dip.

17:35.621 --> 17:36.889
Can you believe that?

17:37.489 --> 17:38.690
[Tiki] And Gianni's jump...

17:40.793 --> 17:44.196
landed him smack-dab
in the belly of the Beast.

17:44.263 --> 17:45.998
Oh no, Gianni! Why?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.503
[Tiki] Now remember, just eight
of tonight's twelve competitors

17:51.570 --> 17:53.439
will advance to Level 2.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.140
Let's check out the leaderboard.

17:55.207 --> 17:59.912
[Tiki] Like a boss, Bassa Mawem of France
leads with 105 points.

17:59.978 --> 18:03.482
[Chris] Which drops Chinese climber,
Dan Zeng, out of the competition.

18:03.549 --> 18:07.953
That means American acrobat Jessica Hill
is on the bubble in eighth place

18:08.020 --> 18:09.455
with just ten points.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.857
[Chris] Setting his sights on the Beast,
from Italy,

18:11.924 --> 18:15.027
it's Luca "the Bazooka" Rinaldi.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.431
[in Italian] My nickname is "Luca Bazooka"

18:19.965 --> 18:21.967
because I am very heavy,

18:22.034 --> 18:25.537
but also tall and strong,

18:26.004 --> 18:29.174
and I like to climb walls
with good, strong holds,

18:29.241 --> 18:31.176
but also quite far apart.

18:31.243 --> 18:34.546
This allows me to have a dynamic,
fast and explosive style,

18:34.613 --> 18:35.981
like a bazooka.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.050
No one can beat the Bazooka.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.989
[Chris] Luca Rinaldi,
going into Faceplant.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.159
When we have an Italian on it,
we call it a "Faceplant Parmesan."

18:47.226 --> 18:49.328
[Tiki chuckles]
This thing takes core strength.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.730
-[Chris] Right.
-[Tiki] The contraption leans forward.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.766
If you don't tighten your core,
you can fall off this thing.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.603
-[Chris] The Bazooka should get through.
-[Tiki] Without a doubt.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.037
[Francesco] Come on, come on!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.374
[Chris] Come on!

19:03.542 --> 19:05.944
[Tiki] Yes, easily on.
To the Energy Coils.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.081
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

19:09.148 --> 19:12.584
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hey, hey! ♪

19:12.651 --> 19:17.022
-[in Italian] Francesco! He is great!
-[in English] Yeah.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.158
I hope... I hope...

19:19.224 --> 19:22.361
The French are jinxing us.
They said he's great!

19:22.895 --> 19:26.865
[in Italian] When the French say
an Italian's good, they do it to jinx us.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.100
Go, Luca!

19:29.801 --> 19:31.336
-[Chris] Oh!
-[Tiki] Wow, he held on.

19:31.403 --> 19:33.972
-[Francesco] Way to go, Luca Bazooka!
-[Bianca] Way to go!

19:34.039 --> 19:35.541
[Tiki] He had to lay out to get that.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.311
This platform is not stable.
It swings back and forth.

19:39.378 --> 19:42.714
-[Chris] You gotta know when to jump.
-[Tiki] Yes. It's a little disconcerting.

19:44.082 --> 19:45.584
Oh, he makes it!

19:45.651 --> 19:48.153
So now he's on, through the Energy Coils.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.155
He's gotta make his way
through the Dead Bolts.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.657
This should be his strength.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.026
Go, Luca Bazooka!

19:54.493 --> 19:56.094
[laughs]

19:56.962 --> 20:00.165
[Chris] He said that it doesn't matter
where you came from,

20:00.232 --> 20:01.567
it matters where you're going.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.135
You're going to the Dead Bolts.

20:04.736 --> 20:07.039
[Tiki] Sitting at 55 points now.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.075
[in English] Point Thruster!

20:10.542 --> 20:12.110
Point Thruster!

20:12.778 --> 20:16.381
[Francesco in Italian] You're
a rock climber! This is easy for you!

20:16.448 --> 20:18.283
Come on, Luca!

20:18.350 --> 20:19.618
[Tiki] Whoa, oh! He makes it.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.253
Is he going to get to the Mag Wall?

20:21.320 --> 20:25.557
The second competitor today
to make it to the Mag Wall... I think so.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.392
-He gets to the Mag Wall.
-[Bianca] Yeah!

20:27.459 --> 20:30.495
[Tiki] Waste no time, because those things
fall off every two seconds.

20:30.562 --> 20:31.530
Luca...

20:31.597 --> 20:33.699
[Francesco] Go, go, go!

20:33.765 --> 20:35.133
Go, Luca!

20:35.200 --> 20:36.301
[Tiki] Another Thruster.

20:36.368 --> 20:39.671
That's the easiest Thruster on the course
if you get to the Mag Wall.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.377
He's gotta swing himself. He's tall,
so he should be able to just jump off.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.912
-[Chris] Just jump!
-[Tiki] Swing.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.481
[Francesco] Swing, bro! Swing!

20:49.548 --> 20:52.384
-[Tiki] One more swing! Luca makes it!
-[Chris] He made it.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.418
[Chris] Luca Bazooka!

20:53.919 --> 20:54.987
Good job, Luca!

20:55.053 --> 20:57.456
-The Bazooka!
-[Tiki chanting] Luca! Luca!

20:57.522 --> 20:59.124
Luca!

20:59.458 --> 21:01.693
-[cheers] Yeah! Let's go!
-[laughing]

21:02.127 --> 21:03.295
[Francesco] Come on!

21:03.695 --> 21:08.300
Yeah, of course Francesco
and Bianca are doing the thing we did.

21:08.367 --> 21:11.270
[in French] Yeah,
are the Italians copying us?

21:11.336 --> 21:12.704
-Yes, they are.
-Yes.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.176
[Bianca] Great, Bazooka!

21:18.944 --> 21:21.480
[Chris] The Bazooka is "through-ca"!

21:22.080 --> 21:24.049
[Francesco] Join your hands, here!

21:24.116 --> 21:26.018
Everybody, put your hands here!

21:26.551 --> 21:29.121
One, two, three!

21:29.187 --> 21:31.189
[all exclaim]

21:32.024 --> 21:33.492
[Bianca] Great!

21:33.558 --> 21:36.361
[Chris] Unfortunately,
Jessica Hill is going back to Vegas.

21:36.428 --> 21:37.829
So thank you, Jessica.

21:38.897 --> 21:42.367
[Tiki] Bassa and Luca are tied
with 105 points.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.237
Remember, time is the tie-breaker.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.974
Because he had a faster time,
Bassa shoots into first,

21:49.041 --> 21:53.945
and Spain's Lorena González
is on life support with just ten points.

21:56.815 --> 22:01.520
[Chris] Up next, from the good ol' USA,
Mr. Felix Chu.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.590
We've got good news, folks. Felix Chu
is chewing through this obstacle course.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.492
USA!

22:07.559 --> 22:10.896
[both chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!

22:10.962 --> 22:12.831
[Tiki] Easily on to the Energy Coils.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.867
This kid had a lot of confidence
when we talked to him before.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.537
-[Chris] Oh, yeah.
-[Tiki] Five foot eight. 140 pounds.

22:18.603 --> 22:22.541
So he should be light enough
to not be affected by fatigue.

22:23.575 --> 22:24.710
Barely makes it on.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.212
He swings around.
He almost fell off the back end.

22:28.380 --> 22:30.015
He's got an interesting technique.

22:30.082 --> 22:34.920
He's actually using the holder
of the Energy Coil to lean back

22:34.986 --> 22:37.222
and use the momentum thrusting forward.

22:37.289 --> 22:38.857
We haven't seen that.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.425
Yes!

22:42.327 --> 22:45.163
-Dead Bolts. Now, these Dead Bolts move.
-[Chris] Yeah.

22:45.230 --> 22:48.633
[Tiki] There's some strategy here.
It's not just strong hands.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.901
It takes some strategy.

22:49.968 --> 22:52.504
He got a Thruster.
That's ten extra points.

22:53.138 --> 22:56.842
He's got 65 points so far,
so comfortably he will move forward.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.378
I'm not sure what he's attempting.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.746
His hands look wary here.

23:02.314 --> 23:04.516
-Those things are not stable.
-[Chris] Uh-huh.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.451
[Tiki] Let's see if this will be an issue.

23:07.753 --> 23:09.121
No problem for him.

23:09.187 --> 23:10.889
But you gotta get momentum going.

23:11.857 --> 23:15.026
-The question now is, can he challenge...
-[Chris] Come on!

23:15.093 --> 23:16.261
[Tiki] ...our two leaders?

23:16.328 --> 23:17.996
-He goes to the last Bolt.
-[Chris] Yes!

23:18.063 --> 23:20.399
-Felix will get to the Mag Wall.
-[Tiki] Confidently.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.334
[Chris] He's gonna get to the Mag Wall.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.668
Come on, Felix.

23:24.536 --> 23:25.971
Come on, Chu.

23:26.037 --> 23:27.406
[Tiki] Oh, no!

23:27.472 --> 23:29.408
-[audience] Oh, no!
-[Chris] Chu!

23:29.474 --> 23:31.209
Wow!

23:31.710 --> 23:33.278
[whines]

23:33.478 --> 23:36.982
You know,
he just didn't swing aggressively enough.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.718
This year's Beast takes aggression.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.253
If you don't have aggression,

23:41.319 --> 23:43.488
you're going to fall
into the blood of the Beast.

23:43.555 --> 23:46.758
You can see he's not aggressive enough
on that swing

23:46.825 --> 23:49.161
to plaster himself onto the Mag Wall.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.863
But, Felix did great.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.965
[in English] But he's not on your team.

23:54.032 --> 23:54.966
[in English] No.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.636
-[Sarah-Jane] Not your team...
-[laughing]

23:57.702 --> 24:01.239
-She...
-She thought he's our contestant.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.175
I feel amazing right now.

24:03.241 --> 24:06.011
To move on to Level 2...
I've been working hard all year.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.414
So to be at the top in the list,
I feel really great.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.884
[Tiki] So with Felix Chu in the top eight,

24:12.951 --> 24:15.220
Lorena González goes down.

24:15.287 --> 24:19.591
And Olympic boxer, Vikas Yadav,
lands on the bubble.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.597
[Chris] Next up, we have Mickaël Mawem.

24:27.098 --> 24:30.602
-[Tiki] His brother "Beasted" this thing.
-[Chris] Finished the whole level.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.137
You've got this.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.206
[Tiki] He'll have to hold on to that chain

24:34.272 --> 24:37.242
to knock out
the Indian prizefighter, Vikas.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.646
[Chris] Mickaël, concentrating
on the Faceplant.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.817
-And he got it.
-[Tiki] Oh, he got it! Vikas, sorry!

24:46.685 --> 24:48.353
[crowd cheering]

24:48.887 --> 24:51.056
[Tiki]
Now for one of these ten-foot jumps.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.025
You can see those Energy Coils moving.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.261
And he hangs on!

24:57.028 --> 24:58.597
[Chris] And he's hugging that. [laughs]

24:58.663 --> 25:01.032
He's hugging that thing
like a tree on Arbor Day.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.535
-Always smiling.
-That's the way!

25:03.602 --> 25:06.805
-That's what confidence looks like!
-Go, Mickaël!

25:07.172 --> 25:10.609
[Tiki] Let's see if this almost
12-foot leap is going to be an issue.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.212
-[Chris] Here we go!
-[Tiki] Just barely makes it.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.180
[French hosts exclaim]

25:15.247 --> 25:17.716
It's all good! It's all good. Come on!

25:17.782 --> 25:19.851
That's right, Mikey!

25:20.352 --> 25:21.987
[Chris] He's on to the Dead Bolts.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.427
[Tiki] He nails the Point Thruster.
That's ten bonus points.

25:29.494 --> 25:30.862
There we go!

25:33.765 --> 25:36.301
The longest jump of the Dead Bolts.
And he gets it.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.671
-[Sandy] Come on, France!
-[Gilles] Come on, Mikey! You can do this!

25:39.738 --> 25:42.641
[Tiki] He's got 75 points right now.
On to the Mag Wall.

25:43.174 --> 25:45.644
[Chris] Are both brothers
gonna be able to complete this level?

25:45.710 --> 25:48.513
There you go! Come on! Go, go, go, go, go!

25:49.614 --> 25:51.049
[Tiki] He hits the last Thruster.

25:51.116 --> 25:55.353
Will he be able to match
his brother's total score of 105 points?

25:55.420 --> 25:56.421
He's got one more swing.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.890
He doesn't even think about it,
he just leaps!

25:58.957 --> 26:00.725
-A confident leap.
-[Chris] Bold.

26:00.792 --> 26:04.763
The Mawem brothers!
France is crushing this competition.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.434
[French team cheering]

26:09.501 --> 26:13.972
Come on, the blues!
Come on, the blues!

26:14.039 --> 26:16.575
The French are celebrating,
but it's only fair.

26:16.641 --> 26:20.879
-There's no need to get upset.
-I know.

26:20.946 --> 26:22.414
Mickaël is first.

26:22.480 --> 26:27.218
Mickaël is in first place. Come here!

26:27.285 --> 26:29.354
[Sandy] Bravo! Well done, Mickaël!

26:29.421 --> 26:33.091
[Tiki] That wraps up Level 1 of the
Beastmaster, and what did we learn?

26:33.158 --> 26:37.262
You cannot mess with the Mawem brothers
from France.

26:37.329 --> 26:38.396
[Chris] Uh-uh!

26:38.463 --> 26:39.698
Those boys can play.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.100
And Luca Bazooka can play, from Italy.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.603
-[Tiki] How about Felix Chu?
-[Chris] Felix Chu-Chu.

26:44.669 --> 26:47.639
Our boy from the USA,
repping San Francisco Bay,

26:47.706 --> 26:48.940
making it to Level 2.

26:49.007 --> 26:50.108
Congrats, Felix.

26:50.475 --> 26:51.509
[Tiki] USA!

26:51.576 --> 26:54.212
[both chanting] USA! USA! USA! USA!

26:54.279 --> 26:57.315
[Chris and Tiki] Chu-SA! Chu-SA!

26:57.382 --> 26:58.917
Chu-SA! Chu-SA!

27:01.853 --> 27:03.254
[Tiki] It's time to get to Level 2.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.991
[Chris] Level 2 raises the bar,

27:06.057 --> 27:09.160
starting with a series of jumps
to the top of Spinal Ascent.

27:09.227 --> 27:12.897
Then down a jumble of cords
in the Vertical Descent.

27:12.964 --> 27:16.067
[Tiki] From there, they will leapfrog
over the spinning podia

27:16.134 --> 27:17.402
of the Stomach Churn,

27:17.469 --> 27:20.271
speed crawl through
the sinking Digestive Track,

27:20.338 --> 27:24.709
and then it's on to the huge set of jumps
over the Dreadmills.

27:25.110 --> 27:29.347
[Chris] After that, they'll have to swing
their way across Chain Reaction,

27:29.414 --> 27:31.549
and finally, through the Vertabrace.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.151
[Tiki] Our eight remaining athletes

27:33.218 --> 27:36.388
have eight minutes to complete
the Beast's second level.

27:36.454 --> 27:39.290
But speed only counts
in the event of a tie.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.426
Really, it's all about points.

27:41.493 --> 27:46.564
There are four Point Thrusters throughout
the level and 155 points up for grabs.

27:46.631 --> 27:49.534
The top five finishers
will advance to Level 3.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.903
It's time for our first athlete.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.172
[Chris] First up, from China, Dong Li.

27:54.239 --> 27:57.976
-[Tiki] Dong Li is sitting with 80 points.
-[Chris] Okay, here we go.

27:58.810 --> 28:01.112
Getting up Spinal Ascent here.

28:01.179 --> 28:06.084
[Tiki] Now, you can see that Spinal Ascent
is moving up and down.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.820
So timing is of utmost importance.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.222
You want to get it at its lowest point.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.224
[Chris] Dong Li's making it look easy.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.193
[in English] So easy!

28:15.260 --> 28:17.796
-[Chris] Dong Li has hops.
-[Tiki] He does have hops.

28:17.862 --> 28:20.498
[in Chinese] Run away, Beast.

28:20.565 --> 28:23.501
[Tiki]
Dong Li now jumps into Spinal Descent.

28:23.568 --> 28:26.371
A bunch of cords that are intertwined,

28:26.438 --> 28:28.573
almost like a spider's web.

28:28.640 --> 28:32.644
If you take one misstep, you fall
into the blood of the Beast below.

28:33.678 --> 28:37.182
Next comes Stomach Churn.
Now, he passed up the Point Thruster.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.317
[Chris] Wow.
Look at the leaping ability on this.

28:39.384 --> 28:42.353
-[Tiki] Dong Li's got some hops.
-[Chris] Dong Li has got major hops.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.222
[Tiki] This is much harder than it looks.

28:44.289 --> 28:45.123
[Qinyi] Go!

28:45.190 --> 28:46.891
-Yeah!
-Nicely done.

28:46.958 --> 28:49.561
[Tiki] You gotta jump and land,
but you're also spinning.

28:49.627 --> 28:53.565
[Chris] You get disoriented here, I bet.
I wonder if his hair blocks his vision.

28:53.631 --> 28:55.467
His hairstyle is cool, right?

28:55.533 --> 28:56.501
Yes.

28:56.601 --> 28:59.471
-He looks like Chen Chang.
-That's right.

28:59.537 --> 29:02.240
[Tiki] Smartly, going sideways.

29:02.307 --> 29:05.110
Now, he passed up
the Point Thruster right there.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.012
And he jumps! Oh, he missed it!

29:08.079 --> 29:11.049
He missed it.
He didn't jump out far enough!

29:12.851 --> 29:16.654
That's too bad. He knew
there was no time left, so he jumped.

29:17.222 --> 29:18.523
He jumped,

29:18.890 --> 29:19.858
and he failed.

29:20.258 --> 29:24.629
-[Chris] He jumped and just couldn't--
-[Tiki] He couldn't land it.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.131
[Chris] Dong Li fought hard.

29:26.531 --> 29:30.401
And with 120 points, Dong Li
leaps to the top of the leaderboard.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.570
He is "Dong-ing" on this competition.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.474
[Tiki] Now the older
of the Mawem brothers,

29:36.775 --> 29:39.110
Bassa, takes on Level 2 of the Beast.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.378
[audience] Bassa!

29:40.445 --> 29:42.847
[Tiki] Okay, here we go. Spinal Ascent.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.984
The average length of this jump
is about 6.5 feet

29:46.050 --> 29:48.319
with three feet apart
between each one of them.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.355
Go!

29:50.421 --> 29:52.257
Go, France!

29:52.323 --> 29:56.261
[Tiki] Bassa holds the French record
for speed climbing 15 meters -

29:56.327 --> 30:00.832
which is almost 49 feet -
in 5.82 seconds.

30:00.899 --> 30:01.866
[Chris] Unbelievable.

30:02.767 --> 30:04.102
Easily...

30:04.169 --> 30:05.603
getting to Spinal Descent.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.740
[Tiki] Down through Spinal Descent
Bassa goes.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.109
That one you could get through, Chris.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.377
-You think?
-[Tiki] Yes.

30:12.443 --> 30:16.447
[Chris] It's just hanging on by the skin
of my teeth. It's just my everyday life.

30:17.315 --> 30:22.353
As you get down to the bottom,
you see those cords get much more sparse

30:22.420 --> 30:25.156
and much harder
to work your way down through.

30:25.623 --> 30:28.059
Bassa through the Spinal Descent.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.931
[Chris] There's a Point Thruster
down there that is so tantalizing.

30:34.599 --> 30:38.369
[Tiki] 10 points he adds! He spins back
around, gets back onto the Stomach Churn.

30:38.436 --> 30:40.605
Four Point Thrusters on this level.

30:41.072 --> 30:42.607
Why is it "Stomach Churn"?

30:43.074 --> 30:44.342
Because they spin.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.477
You have to get your
equilibrium straight.

30:46.544 --> 30:48.413
[Chris] See, look at that. Oh!

30:48.479 --> 30:51.449
[Tiki] He has to decide whether
he's going for the Point Thruster.

30:51.916 --> 30:55.587
Now these wheels are going
at about 12 miles an hour.

30:56.421 --> 30:57.889
Oh! He makes it!

30:57.956 --> 31:01.092
-Ooh, well done, Bassa.
-Come on, Bassa!

31:01.492 --> 31:05.296
They're eating a baguette.
That's the only food in France.

31:05.363 --> 31:08.766
We have pasta, pizza, mozzarella,

31:08.833 --> 31:11.202
salami, the sweet red onion of Tropea...

31:11.269 --> 31:12.804
The French have...

31:12.871 --> 31:14.772
[in English] ...only the baguette.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.908
Let's remind everyone of that!

31:16.975 --> 31:19.143
[Tiki] Now he has to climb up
the Digestive Track.

31:19.210 --> 31:21.846
He's gonna start sinking
into the blood of the Beast.

31:21.913 --> 31:25.450
You have to be really quick
in the Digestive Track.

31:25.516 --> 31:26.351
That's good.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.586
[Tiki] He's got to hustle.
It's all about height.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.989
You've got to jump off
while it's still above...

31:31.356 --> 31:33.892
-[Chris] There he goes.
-[Tiki] He made it just barely.

31:33.958 --> 31:36.895
Those Dreadmills move backwards
against your momentum.

31:36.961 --> 31:40.899
As he climbs up on the second one,
smartly using the edges on the side.

31:41.266 --> 31:42.333
[in English] Yes!

31:43.001 --> 31:44.802
-[in French] Come on!
-[Tiki] Swings up.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.204
Next comes Chain Reaction.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.906
You're doing great, Baz!

31:47.972 --> 31:49.540
[Sandy and Gilles] Come on, the blues!

31:49.607 --> 31:52.677
[Tiki] Obviously Chain Reaction
takes a lot of upper body strength.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.178
And grip strength.

31:54.512 --> 31:57.282
But also timing to grab those chains.

31:57.348 --> 32:00.451
Is he going to go?
And he gets another Point Thruster.

32:00.518 --> 32:04.622
He missed the second one.
He didn't even try it on Stomach Churn.

32:04.689 --> 32:07.659
But he already has gotten
two of the Point Thrusters

32:07.725 --> 32:10.929
as he propels himself
towards the Vertabrace.

32:10.995 --> 32:12.563
One big jump he'll have.

32:12.997 --> 32:16.401
He's smart. He kicked the Vertabrace
so it can come back to him.

32:16.701 --> 32:17.869
Those things are heavy.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.171
He might be stuck here.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.008
He's breathing, collecting himself.

32:24.709 --> 32:27.445
Trying to get as much momentum
as he possibly can.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.514
This is much harder than it looks.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.116
Come on, Bassa!

32:33.518 --> 32:35.153
-[Chris] Wow!
-[Tiki] He's in trouble.

32:35.219 --> 32:37.422
[Chris] A lot of trouble here.
I did not expect this.

32:38.589 --> 32:39.524
Oh!

32:39.590 --> 32:41.893
[Tiki] There he goes, he's finally let go.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.228
-Well done, Bassa!
-Well done, Bassa!

32:45.330 --> 32:50.868
The white witch strikes again!

32:50.935 --> 32:53.604
But you have fallen! [laughs]

32:54.339 --> 32:56.307
[Bassa] It was harder
than I thought it would be.

32:56.607 --> 32:59.844
And I shouldn't have lost my momentum.

33:01.546 --> 33:04.349
Once I lost that, that was it.

33:04.415 --> 33:09.287
[Tiki] With 210 points, Bassa Mawem,
the French climbing champ, now leads.

33:09.354 --> 33:14.759
[Chris] Next up, we have Luca Bazooka
descending down through the Spinal.

33:14.826 --> 33:18.296
-Bazooka!
-Luca Bazooka! Luca Bazooka!

33:18.363 --> 33:20.398
[Tiki] He's thinking
about this Point Thruster.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.100
Let's see... He gets it.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.003
-And he gets back.
-[Chris] And the Bazooka gets back.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.404
[Tiki] Onto the Stomach Churn.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.473
Come on!

33:29.240 --> 33:30.174
[Tiki] And he made it.

33:31.309 --> 33:32.610
This is the hardest jump

33:32.677 --> 33:35.313
because that Stomach Churn
is spinning the fastest.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.782
[Francesco] Come on, Luca!

33:37.849 --> 33:39.250
[Tiki] Scrambling like a spider.

33:39.484 --> 33:40.852
Never getting spun around.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.553
[Francesco] Luca, jump hard!

33:43.554 --> 33:44.756
[TIki] He manages to hang on.

33:44.822 --> 33:46.924
Come on, Luca!

33:46.991 --> 33:49.093
-Great move!
-Way to go, Luca!

33:49.560 --> 33:53.097
[Tiki] The last Stomach Churn
leads into the Digestive Track.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.966
But you have to get up with some speed,

33:55.033 --> 33:58.436
because the lower it gets,
the harder the jump onto the Dreadmills.

33:58.503 --> 34:01.439
Luca scrambling up the Digestive Track.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.874
He's got to emerge quickly,

34:02.940 --> 34:05.309
otherwise, it's gonna be too low
to make the jump.

34:05.376 --> 34:06.744
He's got to jump right away.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.746
-[Bianca] No!
-[Tiki] He doesn't make it!

34:10.415 --> 34:12.183
-Doesn't make it.
-[Chris] The Bazooka.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.485
[Tiki] Into the belly of the Beast!

34:16.320 --> 34:18.755
-Here is this jump. Let's look at it.
-[Chris] Let's see...

34:19.290 --> 34:21.826
-[Chris and Tiki groan]
-[Tiki] Lands really hard.

34:24.996 --> 34:27.398
Next, Mickaël Mawem.

34:27.465 --> 34:28.933
The guy crushed Level One.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.471
Let's see how he attacks Level Two
as he makes his way down Spinal Descent.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.074
-Mickaël's off!
-He's on his way!

34:36.340 --> 34:39.643
[Tiki] He's obviously competing
with his brother, Bassa Mawem.

34:39.710 --> 34:40.978
These two are climbers.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.815
[Chris] Physical climbers,
not like in the business, you know?

34:44.148 --> 34:46.984
[Tiki] Mickaël almost through
the Spinal Descent.

34:47.051 --> 34:49.620
He has to decide
if he's going for the Point Thruster.

34:49.687 --> 34:51.956
[Chris] You know this kid's going for it.

34:53.658 --> 34:57.328
[Tiki] Ten points! Four Point Thrusters
on Level Two of the Beast.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.398
Why are we here?
Should we go watch with the French?

35:00.465 --> 35:03.768
-[Chris] Why not? These kids are so good.
-[Tiki] Let's encourage the French.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.637
-[Sandy] Look...
-[Gilles] The Americans are here.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.773
-That's nice.
-We're support.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.942
-Thanks.
-We've come to offer you support.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.845
[Tiki] There he goes, he makes it.

35:13.911 --> 35:17.582
-[Chris] This kid is good.
-[Tiki] He's good, athletic, long...

35:17.849 --> 35:19.083
[Chris] Oh!

35:20.451 --> 35:22.653
[Tiki] He can't continue
to let himself spin.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.388
Going sideways...

35:24.622 --> 35:26.858
He passed up the Point Thruster
right there.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.092
[Tiki and Chris] Oh!

35:29.393 --> 35:32.830
[Tiki] Very smartly.
Not letting the wheel spin him around.

35:33.764 --> 35:37.001
And now he has to climb up
the Digestive Track very quickly.

35:37.602 --> 35:39.170
There he... Oh, no!

35:39.237 --> 35:41.038
He's gotta hustle. He's gotta move.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.074
Sinking into the blood of the Beast.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.276
[Chris] He's getting through
the Track easily.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.612
[Tiki] He's a climber, this is easy.
A big jump here.

35:48.379 --> 35:49.514
Now he's got to make...

35:49.580 --> 35:50.915
[commentators] Whoa!

35:51.616 --> 35:53.951
[Chris] He hangs on to the Dreadmill
moving backwards.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.853
[Tiki] Those Dreadmills sway
back and forth.

35:56.254 --> 35:57.121
[Sandy] Oh no, no, no!

35:57.188 --> 35:59.223
[Tiki] One more.
He's got a little bit of trouble.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.559
Because those Dreadmills
don't stop moving.

36:01.959 --> 36:03.828
One more leap. One more leap.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.964
-[all] Yes!
-[Sandy shouts]

36:07.465 --> 36:09.400
[Sandy] This guy is amazing!

36:10.535 --> 36:13.337
[Tiki] Now he's on to Chain Reaction.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.841
Got to go back and forth like Tarzan.

36:17.441 --> 36:19.877
[Sandy] A Point Thruster! Ten points.

36:19.944 --> 36:22.313
[Tiki] His brother
is our only competitor so far tonight

36:22.380 --> 36:24.182
to get through to Chain Reaction.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.450
[Chris] You do not want
to be at Thanksgiving

36:26.517 --> 36:27.952
if you let your brother beat you.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.721
Thank God they are from France
and don't know Thanksgiving.

36:31.455 --> 36:35.193
[Tiki] Now he's got to find some momentum
and swing back and forth,

36:35.259 --> 36:39.697
before his hands, arms and shoulders
get too fatigued.

36:39.764 --> 36:43.467
It's a long reach from that last chain.

36:43.534 --> 36:46.938
To get over to the Vertabrace
takes a lot of momentum...

36:47.004 --> 36:48.639
-Oh!
-And he gets it!

36:48.873 --> 36:53.311
He gets it and pulls himself through. One
more hand and he pulls himself through.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.780
[Sandy] 250 points, you guys.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.848
[Tiki] Now he's on to the Vertabraces.

36:57.915 --> 37:00.818
It's about seven feet
between each of these Vertabraces.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.921
So this is not a short jump
for these athletes.

37:03.988 --> 37:06.691
Each one of these jumps is five points.

37:07.191 --> 37:10.027
-[Chris] Here we go, can he do it?
-[Tiki] You've gotta make the leap.

37:10.094 --> 37:11.128
He just hangs on!

37:11.195 --> 37:12.730
Just barely hung on!

37:13.497 --> 37:15.466
[Chris] This is about aiming your jump.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.635
If you jump too high, too low,
you could miss.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.904
You've got to nail that
through the middle.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.374
[Tiki] He is going for the Point Thruster.

37:25.443 --> 37:29.013
Mickaël just hit
the last of the Point Thrusters.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.315
Now he's trying to get the momentum.

37:31.549 --> 37:35.019
Each Vertabrace weighs 200 pounds.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.254
So they're hard to move.

37:37.121 --> 37:38.689
The Indians are here.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.459
[Chris] Everybody's in François. Come on!

37:41.525 --> 37:42.927
And España's coming in!

37:43.361 --> 37:44.695
[Sandy] Come on, the blues!

37:44.762 --> 37:50.268
[in French] ♪ Come on, the blues!
Come on, the blues! ♪

37:50.334 --> 37:52.336
[all cheer]

37:52.837 --> 37:56.274
[Tiki] Now all he's got to do
is leap down.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.809
Flashing the number one sign.

37:58.876 --> 38:00.011
Mickaël!

38:01.078 --> 38:04.215
Our first competitor to complete Level 2!

38:04.548 --> 38:06.183
[Chris] Vive la France!

38:06.751 --> 38:09.420
-[Gilles] Long live France!
-[Sandy] Go, France!

38:09.487 --> 38:11.622
[audience cheering]

38:17.595 --> 38:20.164
Well done.
You're a real champion, you know?

38:20.231 --> 38:21.399
I'm in awe.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.636
-Vive la France!
-Vive la France!

38:27.138 --> 38:28.906
Yes! Onto the next level!

38:28.973 --> 38:32.410
[Chris] Mickaël Mawem
just set the bar sky high.

38:32.476 --> 38:35.046
Gianni Guglielmo has to know
he needs a breakout run

38:35.112 --> 38:37.114
as he makes his way down
Spinal Descent.

38:37.548 --> 38:42.019
[Tiki] He's one of our last qualifiers
from Level One with 35 points.

38:42.086 --> 38:44.722
He's got quite an amount of distance
to make up.

38:45.022 --> 38:47.792
The first of four Point Thrusters
is at the bottom here.

38:47.858 --> 38:50.795
-[Chris] He's gonna do it.
-[Tiki] He will go make a go.

38:50.861 --> 38:53.664
-[yells] Gianni!
-Stay calm.

38:54.198 --> 38:55.366
Stay calm.

38:55.433 --> 38:57.935
[Chris]
Bianca's really screaming loud for Gianni.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.871
[Tiki] Each Point Thruster,
worth 10 points.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.673
It's all cumulative point scoring here.

39:03.140 --> 39:04.075
Oh, he missed it.

39:04.542 --> 39:05.743
He missed it again.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.412
[Chris] Oh!

39:08.479 --> 39:10.014
Gianni!

39:11.649 --> 39:13.784
-[whoops]
-Point Thruster!

39:13.851 --> 39:16.520
[Tiki] The Italians trying to break
their broadcast booth

39:16.587 --> 39:19.223
in celebration of Gianni
getting a Point Thruster.

39:19.290 --> 39:21.625
[Chris] Have you met a guy
with more energy than Francesco?

39:21.692 --> 39:24.995
-[Tiki] No, never.
-He must inject espresso into his veins.

39:25.062 --> 39:26.564
[Tiki] Bianca's got her hands full.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.466
Onto Stomach Churn.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.000
He makes it.

39:31.769 --> 39:33.504
[audience applauds]

39:33.938 --> 39:36.474
-[Tiki] He's got to make this jump now.
-[Chris] Here he goes!

39:36.540 --> 39:40.678
Stay up, Gianni! Don't spin!

39:41.145 --> 39:43.047
[Tiki] He can't continue
to let himself spin.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.548
[Chris] You're disoriented.

39:44.615 --> 39:45.916
[Francesco] Concentrate!

39:45.983 --> 39:47.885
[Bianca] Good! Good! Good! Good!

39:50.287 --> 39:53.324
[Tiki] He thought about
that Thruster but decided against it.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.026
And he makes the jump.

39:58.729 --> 40:00.331
Now he's doing a butt shimmy.

40:00.731 --> 40:03.634
[Chris] Just rubbing his butt
on the Stomach Churn, as you do.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.637
[Bianca] Gianni! Gianni! Gianni! Gianni!

40:08.472 --> 40:12.643
[Tiki] Gianni going up the Digestive
Track. He's having trouble.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.678
All that cockiness may cost him.

40:14.745 --> 40:17.548
Because if you don't get up
this Digestive Track quickly,

40:17.615 --> 40:19.316
you don't have enough altitude...

40:19.383 --> 40:21.318
[Chris] It happens
when you shake your booty.

40:21.385 --> 40:26.757
[Tiki] The rule is all four limbs
have to fall into the blood of the Beast.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.559
There he... oh, no!

40:28.626 --> 40:31.295
Gianni. You know he's going to attempt it.

40:31.362 --> 40:36.667
-He's got to at least attempt it.
-Jump, Gianni! Jump!

40:38.803 --> 40:40.337
Oh, come on!

40:41.372 --> 40:44.175
He's too low, he's too low...

40:44.241 --> 40:46.310
[both] Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

40:47.845 --> 40:50.948
[Gianni] I thought that part
would be my strong point,

40:51.015 --> 40:52.349
but I failed instead.

40:52.416 --> 40:54.185
It's very slippery inside.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.319
You have no grip.

40:56.487 --> 41:00.391
I found a rhythm
by pushing with my back and my legs,

41:00.458 --> 41:01.692
but it was too late.

41:02.026 --> 41:06.630
[Tiki] Gianni Guglielmo's 95 points
are good enough for fifth place.

41:06.697 --> 41:09.700
But not good enough
to keep him safe just yet.

41:09.767 --> 41:10.935
He's on the bubble.

41:11.001 --> 41:14.138
And next up, from India,
Vishwanath Bhaskar.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.139
Bollywood!

41:15.206 --> 41:18.576
-Vishwanath!
-India!

41:20.110 --> 41:21.278
[Tiki] Okay, here we go.

41:21.912 --> 41:23.814
Remember, he is the powerlifter.

41:23.881 --> 41:25.149
Great muscles!

41:25.616 --> 41:29.053
In fact, he was our last qualifier
from Level 1.

41:30.454 --> 41:33.624
[Chris] Come on, Vishwanath!
Vishwanath, you're gonna jump.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.895
He didn't get a good grip.
He's trying, he's trying, he's trying!

41:38.362 --> 41:41.565
[Tiki] He's now using his lower body.
His legs...

41:41.632 --> 41:45.636
-[Sandy] Elbow! Elbow!
-[Vidyut] India! Elbow!

41:45.703 --> 41:49.640
-[commentators] Go, go, go!
-[Vidyut] India! India!

41:49.707 --> 41:51.575
-[Sarah-Jane] Go on!
-[Vidyut] Come on!

41:51.642 --> 41:54.111
[Chris] He's calling
on every God he's ever prayed to

41:54.178 --> 41:56.013
to get up onto this Vertebrae.

41:58.115 --> 42:00.618
Go, go, go, go, go!

42:01.352 --> 42:03.254
[all] No!

42:03.320 --> 42:06.123
[Chris] Vishwanath,
it might be time to go to the deli

42:06.190 --> 42:07.658
and call it a wrap.

42:08.792 --> 42:13.030
[Tiki] That's it. Vishwanath officially
eliminated with only 45 points.

42:14.431 --> 42:17.167
[chanting in Spanish]

42:18.469 --> 42:23.040
[Tiki] Up next, Alex Segura
almost through the Spinal Descent.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.809
He is currently in sixth place.

42:25.876 --> 42:29.380
[Chris] He's gonna need
more than 95 points to knock out Gianni G.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.450
[Tiki] Alex Segura, not even trying
to go for the Point Thruster.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.119
Next comes Stomach Churn.

42:37.154 --> 42:38.889
Okay. Get the pace going.

42:38.956 --> 42:40.424
Go, Spain!

42:43.794 --> 42:45.129
[Tiki] This is the hardest jump,

42:45.195 --> 42:47.765
because that Stomach Churn
is spinning the fastest.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.602
[Chris] And... oh!

42:51.669 --> 42:54.071
We're almost there! Go, Spain!

42:54.405 --> 42:56.206
[Chris] And he's onto the Digestive Track.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.342
[Tiki] Now we know the technique for this.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.345
You've gotta get through quickly
because it starts to sink.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.814
You've got to jump out of it
with some altitude.

43:03.881 --> 43:07.585
[Chris] The only way to knock off
Gianni G, is he's got to get to the top.

43:08.118 --> 43:09.720
[Tiki] He's sliding back a little bit.

43:09.787 --> 43:14.024
That's a very steep climb
up that Digestive Track.

43:14.458 --> 43:17.728
-Come on! You can do it!
-Come on! Jump now!

43:18.562 --> 43:20.664
-Well done! Go, Alex!
-Great!

43:20.731 --> 43:22.666
-Go, Alex!
-Great!

43:22.800 --> 43:27.738
[Tiki] Onto the second of the Dreadmills,
and with that, Gianni has been eliminated.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.607
[Chris] Gianni. Bye-bye, Gianni.

43:29.673 --> 43:32.810
It's okay. Don't worry.
It's a very long race.

43:34.044 --> 43:35.479
[Chris] He's got his footing.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.348
[Paula] He has time. Come on! Come on!

43:37.748 --> 43:39.049
Great! Great!

43:39.116 --> 43:41.719
[chanting in Spanish]

43:41.785 --> 43:45.356
[Tiki] And he'll find himself
preparing for Chain Reaction.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.091
Chris, he's huffing and puffing.

43:47.157 --> 43:48.392
[Chris] Yeah. He looks spent.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.761
I would. I would have thrown up
six times by now.

43:50.828 --> 43:52.763
[Tiki] And this isn't the place
to be spent.

43:52.830 --> 43:55.566
[Chris] Hell no! You've got to swing
on those chains, hermano.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.668
[Tiki] Oh, he's just dead...

43:57.735 --> 44:01.705
-He's done. He has no energy.
-No! No!

44:02.806 --> 44:05.442
[Chris] España!

44:06.877 --> 44:08.612
[Tiki] He never had any confidence

44:09.446 --> 44:11.148
once he got onto Chain Reaction.

44:11.215 --> 44:14.985
But he picks up 130 points

44:15.052 --> 44:17.588
with one more competitor.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.423
Dong Li is on the bubble.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.859
[Chris] Felix Chu from the US is up next,

44:21.925 --> 44:23.460
and he's got a lot of work to do.

44:23.527 --> 44:28.198
He needs to score at least 125 points
to get himself into Level 3.

44:28.732 --> 44:32.436
[Tiki] USA versus China.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.439
You have the option
to go for these Point Thrusters.

44:35.506 --> 44:36.807
Ten bonus points.

44:36.874 --> 44:37.841
[Chris] And...

44:38.175 --> 44:40.644
-Overshot it.
-[Tiki] He overshot, he missed it twice.

44:40.711 --> 44:42.713
-[Chris] Come on.
-[Tiki] He's got to kick it.

44:42.780 --> 44:45.115
-He's getting momentum.
-[Chris] Come on, get some.

44:45.182 --> 44:46.717
-[Tiki] He got it.
-[Chris] There.

44:46.784 --> 44:50.621
[Tiki] He is ten points away
from eliminating Dong Li.

44:55.526 --> 44:58.629
One more leap, and Felix Chu goes-- Oh!

44:59.229 --> 45:02.700
Dong Li has been knocked out
of the competition.

45:03.067 --> 45:05.469
[Chris] Dong Li is saying, "Not me."

45:05.803 --> 45:06.737
But it's you.

45:07.071 --> 45:10.074
[Tiki] As he lands on the last
of the Stomach Churns.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.176
And, again, these points are cumulative,

45:12.242 --> 45:13.577
so he's through.

45:13.644 --> 45:15.479
Those points carry over.

45:15.546 --> 45:19.383
Whoever has the most points
at the end of the round

45:19.450 --> 45:23.954
goes on to the next round, and the chance
to be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

45:24.021 --> 45:24.955
He's got to hustle.

45:25.022 --> 45:28.826
He's got to move very quickly
up this Digestive Track

45:28.892 --> 45:30.427
because it's all about height.

45:31.128 --> 45:33.997
You've got to get through
the Track while it's high

45:34.064 --> 45:35.399
so you can make that leap.

45:38.168 --> 45:40.738
He's moving way too slow
up the Digestive Track!

45:40.804 --> 45:42.372
[Chris] You've got to get through!

45:42.439 --> 45:44.141
Just jump! Just go! Jump!

45:45.008 --> 45:46.076
[Tiki] He makes it!

45:46.143 --> 45:49.513
We've never seen a competitor
jump from that low and make it.

45:49.713 --> 45:51.682
[Chris and Tiki] On the Dreadmill.

45:52.015 --> 45:53.751
[Chris] Felix jumped out of that thing.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.720
Oh, no!

45:56.787 --> 45:58.489
[commentators groan]

45:58.555 --> 46:01.091
[Tiki] He's got to feel so disappointed.

46:02.159 --> 46:04.962
Here comes the replay. Wow, what a jump!
You see that?

46:06.063 --> 46:08.098
The Digestive Track had already sunk

46:08.732 --> 46:11.268
down into the blood of the Beast,
and he still made it.

46:11.335 --> 46:13.737
He didn't take into account the moving.

46:14.204 --> 46:17.674
-Oh, no, he just slipped.
-[Chris] He slipped out.

46:18.208 --> 46:19.710
[Tiki] He did, he did.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.346
[Chris] But he's through.
Chu is through to Level 3.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.182
I felt like I needed
to move as fast as possible

46:25.249 --> 46:29.119
and I think the Dreadmill was swinging
in the wrong direction, so it just got me.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.421
Team USA! USA!

46:32.022 --> 46:33.957
[Tiki] And then there were five.

46:34.158 --> 46:35.759
The Mawem brothers,

46:35.826 --> 46:36.727
Luca,

46:36.794 --> 46:39.730
Felix Chu from the United States
pulling in fourth place,

46:39.797 --> 46:42.399
and Alex Segura from Spain

46:42.833 --> 46:44.501
rounds out the top five.

46:44.768 --> 46:47.037
And they will be advancing to Level 3.

46:48.572 --> 46:50.507
It's time to turn up the heat.

46:50.574 --> 46:54.812
Here's what the remaining five must do
to stay alive in Level 3.

46:54.878 --> 46:57.681
[Chris] On Level 3,
the competitors start on the Ejector,

46:57.748 --> 47:00.284
a monster conveyor
that will rocket them forward

47:00.350 --> 47:04.021
until they jump and grab
the first handhold of Prism Strike.

47:04.087 --> 47:06.590
Then, they fly on a track
around the corner,

47:06.657 --> 47:10.260
hopefully with enough momentum
to jump to a second handhold.

47:10.327 --> 47:13.597
[Tiki] From there, they must shimmy
through the sinking Coil Crawl

47:13.664 --> 47:16.533
then hang tough
as they swing across Hangman,

47:16.600 --> 47:18.202
slide their way up pipeline,

47:18.268 --> 47:20.637
and finally, shimmy up a wall

47:20.704 --> 47:24.241
and on top of the platform
that marks the finish of Level 3.

47:24.308 --> 47:26.877
[Chris] They'll have six minutes
to complete Level 3.

47:26.944 --> 47:31.148
155 points are available,
including the four Point Thrusters.

47:31.215 --> 47:33.150
The top five athletes are here,

47:33.217 --> 47:36.887
and only the best two point scorers
will advance to the final level.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.021
Piece of cake, right?

47:38.088 --> 47:39.890
I was going to say "easy as pie."

47:39.957 --> 47:42.492
But have you ever tried to make pie?
It's not easy.

47:42.559 --> 47:45.162
It's just crust and fruit
and filling in an oven.

47:45.495 --> 47:46.563
You had me at fruit.

47:46.997 --> 47:49.399
All right, let's bring out
our first competitor.

47:49.700 --> 47:53.570
Mickaël Mawem, who is the point leader
going in to Level 3,

47:53.637 --> 47:57.374
with 250 points,
is up first on the Ejector.

47:57.641 --> 48:00.677
[Chris] Mickaël is one of the best
athletes in the entire competition.

48:00.744 --> 48:03.780
[Tiki] Yeah, we've seen that with both
Level 1 and Level 2.

48:04.414 --> 48:08.385
-[Tiki] And he's off!
-[Chris] No problem onto Prism Strike.

48:08.452 --> 48:10.587
[Tiki] Let's see if he goes
for the Point Thruster.

48:10.787 --> 48:12.856
He nails it pretty easily with his hand.

48:13.690 --> 48:17.361
Mickaël holding on as he transfers
to the second handhold.

48:17.427 --> 48:20.163
Another five points.
Currently, with 20 points.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.531
[speaks French]

48:21.598 --> 48:24.601
[Tiki] Mickaël making his way
through the Coil Crawl.

48:24.668 --> 48:28.572
Each one of these Crawls is about
eight feet long. Five points for each one.

48:28.639 --> 48:31.041
But they sink into the fuel
of the Pyramid,

48:31.108 --> 48:33.110
so you have to be quick and efficient.

48:33.176 --> 48:35.245
He is flying through this coil.

48:36.113 --> 48:39.349
-Watch him go!
-Look at that technique he has!

48:40.117 --> 48:41.818
It's unbelievable.

48:42.886 --> 48:45.622
[Tiki] He's onto the third
of the Coil Crawls.

48:45.689 --> 48:48.091
This is the one
where he has to get through quickly

48:48.158 --> 48:50.894
if he wants an opportunity
to jump for Hangman.

48:50.961 --> 48:53.764
[Chris] He's up there quick.
He's on to Hangman.

48:55.699 --> 48:58.402
[Tiki] There's 15
of these Hangman triangles.

48:58.468 --> 49:00.704
Each one of these
is worth five points as well.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.607
[Chris] And as he gets to the next one,
as you can see,

49:03.674 --> 49:08.478
those other Hangman triangles get
shot up and they can no longer be used.

49:11.548 --> 49:12.883
Go, Mike! Go!

49:15.652 --> 49:19.222
[Chris] Here's the climbing technique
that people with climbing experience use

49:19.289 --> 49:23.293
where they loop their leg through and they
put their arm there to give it a rest.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.128
[Tiki] It's called the figure four.

49:25.195 --> 49:26.997
A lot of climbing competitors use it,

49:27.064 --> 49:31.935
but you cannot use your feet or legs
on the Hangman.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.137
[Chris] The ingenuity is unbelievable.

49:34.204 --> 49:37.140
[Tiki] That's right.
The athleticism is unbelievable.

49:37.207 --> 49:40.477
I couldn't get my foot over my arm
if I was sitting down.

49:41.111 --> 49:44.114
This kid is hanging
off a Hangman doing it.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.817
[Tiki] He's going
for one of four Point Thrusters.

49:46.883 --> 49:47.718
[Chris] Kick it!

49:47.784 --> 49:50.153
[Tiki] Remember the Thrusters
are an extra ten points.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.923
-He's got it!
-[Chris] He gets the Thruster in the face.

49:52.990 --> 49:54.491
He's doing well...

49:54.558 --> 49:56.960
His technique's working, it is.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.462
[Chris] This kid is unbelievable!

49:58.528 --> 50:00.931
[Tiki] Upside down in a figure four,

50:00.998 --> 50:03.567
kicking the wall
and getting the Point Thruster.

50:03.633 --> 50:05.669
How can you not root for this kid?

50:05.736 --> 50:06.770
[Chris] Oh, my goodness!

50:08.505 --> 50:11.541
[Tiki] It looks like maybe, Chris,
he wore himself out.

50:12.309 --> 50:15.946
He is stuck. His arms are shaking,
they're so tired.

50:16.013 --> 50:17.948
[Sandy] I'm a little bit scared.

50:18.915 --> 50:20.517
Come on, guys!

50:21.018 --> 50:24.087
[Tiki] The fact that he's hung on
this long is astonishing.

50:24.454 --> 50:28.959
But he's trying to find that last bit
of strength to go up one more rung.

50:29.026 --> 50:30.227
This could be the end.

50:30.527 --> 50:33.196
-[Chris] Yeah, this is...
-[Tiki] He's giving this little...

50:33.563 --> 50:34.564
There it is.

50:35.232 --> 50:38.668
Mickaël. He got really, really far.

50:38.735 --> 50:41.405
Our champion got really far.
Really well done.

50:41.471 --> 50:46.043
It's... It's very tiring,
when you have to keep doing this.

50:47.077 --> 50:49.546
And all of a sudden I froze. My arms...

50:50.047 --> 50:52.349
And once I had frozen like that...

50:52.416 --> 50:54.451
I tried to get my breath back,

50:54.518 --> 50:57.387
get the momentum back,
so I could go forward.

50:57.454 --> 50:58.922
It was my arms, but never mind.

50:59.122 --> 51:00.557
[Chris] Look at this bod, folks.

51:00.957 --> 51:02.292
He doesn't know what fat is.

51:02.692 --> 51:04.327
Why don't you eat a piece of bread?

51:04.961 --> 51:08.198
And now, the Mawem brothers
are in the final. We're in the final.

51:09.199 --> 51:11.668
[Chris] 345 points.

51:11.735 --> 51:12.969
What a performance!

51:13.370 --> 51:16.073
[Tiki] Felix Chu of the United States
is up next.

51:16.139 --> 51:18.975
He comes in with 145 points.

51:19.042 --> 51:23.780
His only hope is that he can get enough
points to pull ahead of Bassa Mawem,

51:23.847 --> 51:26.750
who is currently in second
with 210 points.

51:27.150 --> 51:28.785
A difficult task for sure.

51:28.852 --> 51:30.787
But we are rooting for the American.

51:30.854 --> 51:32.389
[Chris] Come on, Felix!

51:32.456 --> 51:34.691
[horn sounds]

51:35.692 --> 51:37.427
[Tiki] Here he goes, down the Ejector.

51:37.928 --> 51:41.264
Felix Chu deftly gets
from the Ejector to the Prism Strike.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.633
[Chris] Get this Point Thruster, buddy.

51:44.167 --> 51:46.303
-Missed it!
-[Tiki] He missed the Point Thruster!

51:46.703 --> 51:48.338
That could come back to haunt him.

51:48.405 --> 51:51.174
[Chris] Well he tried... Look at this,
Tiki. Now he's in trouble.

51:51.608 --> 51:54.144
Now he's in trouble.
He mis-timed the jump.

51:54.211 --> 51:56.146
And now he's in big, big trouble.

51:56.213 --> 52:00.951
He's got to really work hard to try to get
to the second hand of the Prism Strike.

52:01.017 --> 52:02.185
[Tiki] He's stuck.

52:02.719 --> 52:04.187
He's still hanging,

52:04.254 --> 52:06.189
like a sack of potatoes.

52:06.623 --> 52:10.060
He's thinking
whether he wants to get fried

52:10.127 --> 52:11.294
or not.

52:12.395 --> 52:15.732
[Tiki] There is absolutely
nothing he can do at this point.

52:16.166 --> 52:17.367
[groans] He just...

52:17.834 --> 52:22.272
And finally,
Felix dips into the oil of the Pyramid.

52:23.473 --> 52:26.209
[Chris] 150 points for Felix Chu
of the United States.

52:26.276 --> 52:30.780
But he's a country mile
behind Bassa Mawem, so Felix is finished.

52:33.216 --> 52:36.653
[Tiki] Alex Segura of Spain
is next up in Level 3.

52:36.920 --> 52:38.855
Let's see how he does on the Ejector.

52:38.922 --> 52:41.124
[horn sounds]

52:46.062 --> 52:47.898
[Chris] There he is,
and he has a good start.

52:48.665 --> 52:50.433
[Tiki] Will he get the Point Thruster?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.269
He gets it. Nails it with his foot.

52:54.404 --> 52:55.505
Oh, no!

52:55.572 --> 52:58.141
He got stuck
in the same place as the other one.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.342
[Chris] This is bad.

52:59.409 --> 53:02.312
What do you have to do here, Tiki?
Jerk it forward? I mean--

53:02.379 --> 53:03.680
[Tiki] I don't even know.

53:03.747 --> 53:06.917
Unless you've got
extraordinarily long arms,

53:06.983 --> 53:09.753
I'm not sure
there's anything you can do here, Chris.

53:09.819 --> 53:12.122
You could give it all your core,
all your leg.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.391
-I don't think it's possible.
-[Tiki and Chris groan]

53:14.457 --> 53:16.326
He just cannonballs it. Lets go.

53:16.393 --> 53:20.597
-[Saúl] What a shame.
-It's a shame. [groans]

53:20.764 --> 53:25.035
[Tiki] Alex Segura. 145 points.

53:25.101 --> 53:28.638
Nowhere near enough
to put himself in position for Level 4.

53:29.706 --> 53:33.577
[Chris sighs] All right, well...
Next up is Luca the Bazooka.

53:33.643 --> 53:36.580
[Tiki] Luca Rinaldi, at 165 points,

53:36.646 --> 53:39.516
needs 50 points to pull ahead
of Bassa Mawem

53:39.583 --> 53:41.284
who hasn't even gone yet.

53:41.351 --> 53:42.986
To have any shot in the competition,

53:43.053 --> 53:45.889
Luca needs to reach
the fifth handhold of Hangman,

53:45.956 --> 53:47.791
just to make it to Level 4.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.626
Go, Luca!

53:49.693 --> 53:51.895
Come on, Luca! Go!

53:51.962 --> 53:53.396
[horn sounds]

53:53.463 --> 53:55.966
[Tiki] Luca Rinaldi, down the Ejector,

53:56.032 --> 53:57.834
looking to leap, and he makes it on.

53:57.901 --> 54:01.171
-[Bianca] Go!
-[Francesco] Point Thruster!

54:01.638 --> 54:02.772
[Tiki] He misses!

54:02.839 --> 54:05.609
-[Bianca] He missed it!
-[Chris] Misses the Point Thruster.

54:05.675 --> 54:09.512
But gets on to the second level
of the Prism Strike,

54:09.579 --> 54:10.947
going towards the Coil Crawl.

54:11.014 --> 54:12.048
[Francesco] Coil Crawl.

54:12.115 --> 54:13.984
[Bianca] Great! Luca Bazooka!

54:14.050 --> 54:15.652
[Francesco] Come on, Luca!

54:16.152 --> 54:18.054
[TIki] He's got
to get through these quickly.

54:18.121 --> 54:19.889
Obviously, if they start sinking,

54:20.390 --> 54:24.794
it makes it much more difficult to get
through that eight feet of Coil Crawl.

54:24.861 --> 54:26.730
Five points for each one of these.

54:26.830 --> 54:28.298
Go, go, go!

54:28.365 --> 54:30.033
Quick, quick!

54:30.100 --> 54:31.735
Before it sinks!

54:31.801 --> 54:34.304
Come on! Come on!

54:34.371 --> 54:37.340
[both chanting] Luca! Luca! Luca!

54:37.407 --> 54:39.242
[Tiki] This last Coil Crawl is important.

54:39.309 --> 54:40.644
You've gotta get through quickly

54:40.710 --> 54:43.980
in order to give yourself a chance
to get to the Hangman.

54:46.783 --> 54:48.184
Now he is on one Hangman.

54:48.251 --> 54:52.088
He needs to get at least five of these

54:52.155 --> 54:55.525
to put himself five points
above Bassa Mawem,

54:55.592 --> 54:57.360
who still has yet to go.

54:57.427 --> 55:00.230
[audience cheering]

55:01.364 --> 55:04.200
[Tiki] He seems a little bit
dead in his tracks here.

55:05.001 --> 55:07.804
He's gotta get some swing
so he can give himself a chance.

55:07.871 --> 55:10.874
-He grabbed the Hangman!
-Great job!

55:10.940 --> 55:12.075
He can't fail!

55:12.876 --> 55:15.679
[Tiki] Every time he grabs
a new Hangman ring,

55:15.745 --> 55:17.547
he racks up another five points.

55:17.614 --> 55:20.684
There's a total of 75 points
available here.

55:20.750 --> 55:22.719
Strategy plays a big part in this.

55:22.786 --> 55:25.121
Swing, baby, swing!

55:25.188 --> 55:27.691
Swing, baby, swing!

55:27.991 --> 55:30.694
[Chris] And the Bazooka,
he's about 165 pounds,

55:30.760 --> 55:33.530
so he can really get some movement
going here.

55:33.596 --> 55:35.498
[Tiki] He's swaying back and forth.

55:35.565 --> 55:36.766
And as you see...

55:36.833 --> 55:38.368
[Tiki and Chris] Oh!

55:38.435 --> 55:40.337
No!

55:40.403 --> 55:42.205
[Chris] Bazooka falls into the oil.

55:42.272 --> 55:47.310
[Tiki] He finishes with 205 points.

55:47.377 --> 55:51.848
So without even running,
Bassa Mawem goes on to Level 4.

55:52.115 --> 55:56.820
Now, even though he's guaranteed a spot in
the finals, Bassa needs a good run here,

55:56.886 --> 55:59.222
because remember, points are cumulative.

55:59.289 --> 56:00.423
So tonight's winner

56:00.490 --> 56:03.693
is gonna be the Mawem brother
with the most total points

56:03.760 --> 56:05.428
from all four levels.

56:05.495 --> 56:07.697
[Chris] Bassa Mawem's got 210 points,

56:07.764 --> 56:10.600
which is 135 points
behind his baby brother.

56:10.667 --> 56:11.768
[horn sounds]

56:11.835 --> 56:13.570
[Tiki] All right. And he is off.

56:14.270 --> 56:18.007
Let's see how close Bassa Mawem
can get to his brother, Mickaël.

56:20.243 --> 56:22.345
He nails the Point Thruster.

56:22.412 --> 56:25.382
As he whips around,
he grabs the second handhold

56:25.448 --> 56:27.083
and makes his way into Coil Crawl.

56:27.150 --> 56:29.786
See how quickly he goes through
the Coil Crawl.

56:29.853 --> 56:31.721
[Chris] These kids are unbelievable.

56:31.788 --> 56:34.758
They do it like they know for a fact
they're gonna do it.

56:34.824 --> 56:36.393
[Tiki] Their background is in climbing.

56:36.459 --> 56:40.363
And let's not forget,
Bassa is the older brother.

56:40.430 --> 56:43.133
He doesn't want to be bested
by his younger brother.

56:43.199 --> 56:44.667
[speaking French]

56:44.734 --> 56:48.238
[Tiki] Each one of these Coil Crawls
will give him five points.

56:48.638 --> 56:51.908
He's currently in the third
of the Coil Crawls.

56:56.513 --> 56:59.682
[audience chanting]

57:01.818 --> 57:04.554
[Tiki] He's effectively
and easily onto Hangman.

57:04.621 --> 57:05.789
[Chris] No problem there.

57:05.855 --> 57:07.991
Get some momentum going! Grab it!

57:08.591 --> 57:11.661
One at a time! Now! Don't let go.

57:12.228 --> 57:14.631
[Chris] But he's a little heavier at 168,

57:14.697 --> 57:17.767
so I don't know if that's an advantage
or disadvantage here,

57:17.834 --> 57:21.104
because you're pulling more weight
but you're getting momentum,

57:21.171 --> 57:23.006
so we'll see what the trade-off is.

57:23.072 --> 57:24.574
You've got the pace.

57:24.641 --> 57:26.943
[Tiki] It's very hard, as you see,

57:27.010 --> 57:31.748
to hold your whole body weight
with one or two arms.

57:31.815 --> 57:34.083
Same technique as his brother, of course.

57:34.150 --> 57:38.288
[Tiki] You see him doing the figure four,
just like his brother Mickaël did,

57:38.354 --> 57:40.590
to give his arms some rest.

57:40.957 --> 57:47.263
Interestingly, it actually makes you
closer to the next of the rings

57:47.330 --> 57:49.766
when you get into
that figure four position.

57:49.833 --> 57:52.669
He's gonna have to decide
whether he's gonna go for the Thruster.

57:54.003 --> 57:57.273
He did get that Point Thruster,
so ten extra points

57:57.774 --> 57:59.075
for Bassa Mawem.

58:00.543 --> 58:02.879
He's getting closer
to his brother's score.

58:02.946 --> 58:04.581
It could be an interesting final.

58:04.981 --> 58:07.917
[Tiki] There's a decided advantage
for the climbing techniques

58:07.984 --> 58:11.054
that these Mawem brothers have developed
over the years.

58:11.120 --> 58:12.422
Come on! That's it!

58:12.489 --> 58:14.324
[Chris] His brother's cheering him on,
too.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.126
He got to more Hangmen than his brother.

58:17.193 --> 58:18.461
[Tiki] He got through more.

58:18.528 --> 58:20.430
[Chris] Look at him go!
This is unbelievable.

58:20.497 --> 58:21.898
[Tiki] This is unbelievable,

58:21.965 --> 58:25.068
how effective and efficiently
he's moving through Hangman.

58:26.903 --> 58:28.638
[Chris] He's making it look easy, almost.

58:29.105 --> 58:30.773
[Tiki] Deliberate. No panic.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.675
He's got two more.

58:35.011 --> 58:39.082
It looks like Bassa Mawem
is going to be our first competitor

58:39.148 --> 58:40.650
to get to the Pipeline.

58:40.717 --> 58:42.652
Now, this Pipeline is diabolical.

58:42.719 --> 58:44.220
You gotta slide this forward.

58:44.287 --> 58:47.323
This is forearm strength
like most people don't have.

58:47.390 --> 58:49.225
But he's got determination.

58:51.094 --> 58:55.098
You can see him working.
He's pushing hard to get to the wall.

58:55.899 --> 58:57.700
-[Sandy] Bassa!
-[Gilles] Come on, Bassa!

58:57.767 --> 58:58.902
[Sandy] Go!

59:00.570 --> 59:03.373
[Tiki] Ten points to tie,
but, oh, he can't make it!

59:04.340 --> 59:07.710
335 points for Bassa Mawem.

59:07.777 --> 59:11.114
What a competition we have set up
for Level 4!

59:12.081 --> 59:13.449
Guys, applause!

59:13.516 --> 59:14.817
Applause!

59:14.884 --> 59:16.886
Congratulations to the French!

59:16.953 --> 59:19.989
[both speaking French]

59:21.024 --> 59:24.360
[Tiki] Level 3 is done,
and here's what we have coming up.

59:24.427 --> 59:27.797
Level 4 - Mickaël Mawem
versus Bassa Mawem.

59:27.864 --> 59:32.802
A chance for $10,000,
and the title of Beastmaster is at stake.

59:32.869 --> 59:35.538
And, more importantly,
bragging rights at home

59:35.605 --> 59:36.906
between the brothers.

59:40.176 --> 59:41.544
[laughing]

59:41.611 --> 59:44.013
-[Bassa] Good luck.
-[Mickaël] We're going all the way.

59:44.080 --> 59:47.650
-Yes. Be strong.
-You too.

59:48.217 --> 59:51.154
It's going to be hard.
We climbed all the way to the top!

59:51.220 --> 59:53.923
[French team cheering]

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:03.499
[French team chanting]

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.003
[Tiki] There's a lot of love
between these brothers, for good reason.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:09.906
Together,
they've overcome incredible odds.

01:00:10.506 --> 01:00:13.643
When I was nine, my parents separated.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.712
And my two brothers, my sister and I

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:18.281
found ourselves in a car
heading for Africa.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:23.653
We arrived in Cameroon and,
in order to frighten my mother,

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.221
and us too,

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:29.158
my father burned everything
that proved we were French.

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:32.762
We had nothing left
that linked us to France.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:35.999
He took us to his village.

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:38.067
It was really basic, no electricity.

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:42.038
All the details are exactly
what you would expect

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.606
to see in a documentary

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:46.809
about little, malnourished
African children.

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.779
[Mickaël] My mother came to see us twice,

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:52.315
and the third time,
she came to take us back.

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:58.287
It's something
we've tried to forget about.

01:00:58.354 --> 01:01:00.156
Now, we want
to think about the future

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.824
and keep moving forward.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:08.464
[Bassa] Your life
isn't about what you've done,

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.999
it's about what you're doing.

01:01:12.902 --> 01:01:14.070
[Tiki] This is it!

01:01:14.137 --> 01:01:16.039
We have reached Level 4.

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:21.477
Two athletes, one winner,
$10,000 on the line.

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:23.913
And if you thought
they had to dig deep before,

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.349
get ready for some next-level action,

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.686
because they're gonna do this course
side-by-side.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:34.223
[Chris] First, the two finalists have
to jump back and forth superhero-style

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:36.826
up the 20-foot-high Ricochet,

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.696
summon all their strength
across Full Tilt,

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:43.700
where every handhold drops
and tries to shake them loose.

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:45.435
[Tiki] After that, they hit a wall.

01:01:45.501 --> 01:01:48.838
Not because their muscles are sore.
It's called the Motherboard.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.840
A muscle-burning peg wall.

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:53.976
From there, they'll jab and swing
across Sky Hook.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:58.681
And finally, make the final push
up the 35-foot Ventilator to the finish.

01:01:58.748 --> 01:02:01.818
Dude, I'm seriously going to throw up
just listening to that.

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:06.189
[Tiki] There are four Point Thrusters
on Level 4,

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:10.593
each worth ten points,
except for the last one, on the top.

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:11.894
It's the Motherload.

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.463
200 points!

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:17.333
Now, there is a five minute time limit
on Level 4.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.534
Remember, in the end,

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:22.638
the competitor with the highest number
of points from all four levels combined

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:24.874
will win $10,000

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:27.243
and be crowned tonight's Beastmaster.

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.512
Plus, they'll return on the final night

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:33.015
to face all the other winners
for a shot at the ultimate prize -

01:02:33.483 --> 01:02:36.152
the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:38.087
-Oh, and $50,000.
-There you go.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:42.024
[Tiki] This is an epic battle.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:45.762
France versus France.
Brother versus brother.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:49.899
Mickaël Mawem versus Bassa Mawem.

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:55.004
They come in to Level 4
only ten points apart.

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:57.974
Competitors, ready!

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.875
[horn sounds]

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:01.210
-Go, France!
-Go!

01:03:01.511 --> 01:03:04.313
[Tiki] And there they go, up Ricochet.

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:08.151
It's unbelievable
how effective these athletes are.

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:12.388
They've reached
the five-point boulders.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:13.956
[Tiki] Now as they get to Full Tilt,

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.992
these blocks drop about a foot

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.827
each time weight is put on them.

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:20.797
Five points for each of those six blocks.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.499
This is a race for the Point Thruster.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:27.670
-Bassa actually ignores it.
-[Chris] Wow!

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.740
-And so did his brother.
-[Tiki] And just starts climbing.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:34.944
They are making their way
up the Motherboard with these little pegs.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:37.046
[Chris] This isn't about Point Thrusters.

01:03:37.113 --> 01:03:39.448
This is just you.
They don't care about points.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:43.452
[Tiki] So many different strategies
to take on Level 4.

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.923
Right now it's about
who's more physically capable,

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.257
who's quickest,

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.425
not points.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.660
[Gilles] They're so fast!

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:53.763
Wow.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.532
That's the best moment of the series!

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:59.068
The best moment of the series.

01:03:59.635 --> 01:04:02.238
[Tiki] Mickaël has a slight lead

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.141
over his brother, Bassa.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:11.981
They are both very diligently
going across Sky Hook now.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.151
[Chris] Dangling 60 feet in the air.

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.887
[Tiki] Every one of those hooks
is five more points.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.423
Bassa seems a little bit stuck.

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:22.592
Trying to build some momentum.

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:25.361
They can't fall,
they'll be back at the bottom again.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.663
Or they might be able
to grab on somewhere.

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:30.766
[Tiki] Mickaël has completed the Sky Hook.

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.770
[cheering]

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.206
[Tiki] There are two minutes left

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:39.542
and they've got
the hardest of the obstacles left -

01:04:39.609 --> 01:04:43.145
a tight climb, 35 feet up the Ventilator.

01:04:45.314 --> 01:04:50.019
[Chris] And Mickaël, the younger brother,
getting a slight edge on Bassa.

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:53.789
The big brother, Bassa, is having
trouble getting up the Ventilator

01:04:53.856 --> 01:04:56.525
because he outweighs his little brother
by ten pounds.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:58.661
[Tiki] This is a tight squeeze for sure.

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.664
He hit the Point Thruster.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.433
[Chris] Mickaël - in the lead -

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.637
is a boulderer and Bassa
is actually a speed climber.

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:12.608
So, as you can see, boulderering is the
technique that may win the Ventilator.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:17.647
[Tiki] And Bassa looks a little bit winded
as he's lagging behind.

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:19.882
Who is going to get there first?

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:24.220
It looks like Mickaël
has not lost any of his momentum,

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:27.290
while Bassa has to keep stopping
to catch his breath.

01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:31.193
[Chris] And this is hard. These are two
of the best competitors we have.

01:05:31.794 --> 01:05:33.930
And you can see they're really struggling.

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:40.937
[Tiki] And it looks like Mickaël
is atop the Ventilator.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.605
Go, Mickaël!

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:44.507
[Chris] And he's there!

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.510
[Tiki] What is Mickaël doing?

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:49.979
He isn't hitting the 200 Point Thruster.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.914
Will he give his brother the victory

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.417
by letting him hit
the last Point Thruster?

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.887
What is he waiting for?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.324
-Come on, Bassa.
-Come on, you've got to finish, Bassa!

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.025
[Sandy] This is wonderful!

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:05.594
[Gilles] Everyone's standing up,
30 seconds left.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:07.296
[Chris] Bassa, you've got to move!

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.698
Time is running out!

01:06:10.032 --> 01:06:11.467
[Tiki] He will get to the top!

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.270
[Chris] Maybe he's gonna let Bassa
hit the Point Thruster?

01:06:15.938 --> 01:06:18.107
[Tiki] He does not!

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.209
He hits the mother of all Point Thrusters.

01:06:20.276 --> 01:06:24.347
Wins Level 4,
and the title of Beastmaster!

01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:26.082
Well done, France!

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.717
Well done, France!

01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:31.354
-[exclaims]
-[in English] Not bad. Not bad.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.855
Wow.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:36.092
-Made it. So beautiful.
-It makes me want to cry!

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.461
Great! Great, Mickaël!

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.963
Great competition!

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.366
Wow, that was unbelievable.

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.633
[both cheer]

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.602
-[Sandy] They're cute.
-[Gilles] Wonderful.

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.705
I've got goose bumps, I do.

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:54.977
[Tiki] Both of the Mawem brothers
finish Level 4 of the course.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:59.882
But Mickaël earns the $10,000 prize

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.385
and the title of Beastmaster.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:08.591
He is also now in our final
with the title of Ultimate Beastmaster.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.894
[all cheering]

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.262
[Gilles] What a great story.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:14.730
Mickaël has won.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.066
The French team is delighted
for the brothers.

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:18.734
They all have a great bond.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:24.874
When I got to the top,

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.777
I didn't want to shout out,
I wanted to wait for my brother.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.379
[Bassa] I'm not disappointed
my brother got there first.

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:33.949
He'll be the one
representing us in the final.

01:07:34.016 --> 01:07:36.085
We'll show everyone
they've got no chance.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.086
That's right.

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:39.155
[all cheering]

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:43.092
If you want to find out
who they'll face, stay there.
