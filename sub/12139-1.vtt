[skateboard rolling]

00:50.137 --> 00:54.054
[instrumental music playing]

01:38.881 --> 01:42.189
[alarm clock ringing]

02:30.672 --> 02:32.064
[on TV] Come on!
Three good minutes!

02:32.239 --> 02:33.675
Hustle! Hustle! Let's go!

02:33.849 --> 02:36.808
Come on! Do it!

02:36.982 --> 02:39.811
Watch the pool.
Watch the pool!

02:42.205 --> 02:43.728
CATANA STARKS:
Good morning, ladies!

02:45.817 --> 02:47.689
- Stacey!
- Yes?

02:47.863 --> 02:53.869
2:09:64 at Central Florida
in March 200-meter butterfly.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.045
Hey! Eyes up here!

02:56.219 --> 02:59.831
I can rattle off numbers all
day long for everybody in here.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.355
I watch a lot of film.

03:03.922 --> 03:04.923
Another thing, Stacey.

03:05.097 --> 03:07.404
35, what does that number mean?

03:07.578 --> 03:09.189
- That's my MCAT...
- CATANA: Speak up!

03:09.363 --> 03:11.930
- It's my MCAT score!
- CATANA: That's right!

03:12.104 --> 03:13.889
For those of you
that don't know,

03:14.063 --> 03:18.633
35 means Stacey can go to any
medical school she pleases.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.679
[applause]

03:21.853 --> 03:23.420
Let me tell you how she did it.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.814
Work.

03:25.988 --> 03:29.905
First in the library,
last out every night,

03:30.079 --> 03:32.603
and that deserves
a round of applause.

03:32.777 --> 03:34.649
[cheering]

03:34.823 --> 03:39.784
DEAN WINTERS:
4,550 career-receiving yards,

03:39.958 --> 03:42.570
328 career receptions.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.790
Kendrick Paulsen's name
is already all over

03:45.964 --> 03:47.575
TSU's record books,

03:47.749 --> 03:49.925
and we are proud
to have him back

03:50.099 --> 03:52.884
as our newest
athletic director.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.538
But before I have him speak,

03:54.712 --> 03:56.932
I'd like to acknowledge
the Paulsen family.

03:57.106 --> 04:00.370
Kendrick Paulsen, Sr.
specifically,

04:00.544 --> 04:04.809
and his 20 million dollar
grant to our endowment fund.

04:04.983 --> 04:09.379
But without further adieu,
Kendrick Paulsen, Jr.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.773
[applause]

04:12.861 --> 04:14.123
KENDRICK PAULSEN, JR:
Thank you, Dean Winters.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.994
The first order of business

04:16.168 --> 04:19.998
we have a total
noncompliance issue.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.218
The baseball team
will need to be cut

04:22.392 --> 04:23.959
and replaced with
two smaller teams

04:24.133 --> 04:27.005
to have an equal balance
of male and female athletes.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.833
The women's team
is set at lacrosse,

04:29.007 --> 04:30.748
but we have not decided
what the men's team will be.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.837
How about golf?

04:33.011 --> 04:34.752
- Golf?
- You know what I heard?

04:34.926 --> 04:37.755
They got the name The Masters
from the slave masters,

04:37.929 --> 04:39.104
plantation owners!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.281
- Really?
- That's what I heard.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.848
That's my point exactly.
Now you take a sport like golf

04:44.022 --> 04:46.938
that's so hostile to us
and show 'em what's what.

04:47.112 --> 04:47.809
Like Tiger Woods.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.463
There you go.

04:49.637 --> 04:52.379
Here's...here's
the problem with golf.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.772
There's no access
for most black kids.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.949
There's no such thing as
an inner city country club.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.387
Didn't stop Grambling,
Jackson State,

05:00.561 --> 05:02.258
they got programs.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.129
I mean if Grambling and
Jackson State have programs,

05:04.304 --> 05:06.784
that leaves X number of kids
that won't be coming here.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.438
Why wouldn't they?

05:08.612 --> 05:10.353
We've got tradition.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.573
We produced
59 Olympic athletes.

05:12.747 --> 05:14.705
Now, that's more
than most countries.

05:14.879 --> 05:17.055
I'm just telling you that golf
is not a popular sport

05:17.229 --> 05:20.537
with the kinds of kids that
come here, and it's expensive.

05:20.711 --> 05:24.149
Expensive? Look, every year
I give more and more,

05:24.324 --> 05:26.500
and I see less and less.
I'm done.

05:26.674 --> 05:29.633
We need a better football
program, better basketball,

05:29.807 --> 05:31.461
track and field, and golf.

05:33.245 --> 05:37.989
[instrumental music playing]

05:42.080 --> 05:43.560
ROGER:
Hey, you heading out?

05:43.734 --> 05:45.519
Yeah.

05:45.693 --> 05:48.652
First day on the job
kick your butt, huh?

05:48.826 --> 05:50.175
Who's light is on?

05:50.350 --> 05:52.526
Oh, that's Starks,
ladies swim coach.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.267
Didn't the season just end?

05:55.442 --> 05:57.487
You haven't met
Starks have you?

05:57.661 --> 06:00.142
She wouldn't leave early if
the school is burning down.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.146
Good night, boss.

06:08.193 --> 06:13.024
[cd] The price of success is
and has always been sacrifice.

06:13.198 --> 06:16.724
The truly exceptional
do not work nine to five,

06:16.898 --> 06:18.552
rarely take vacations

06:18.726 --> 06:21.381
and struggle deeply
to maintain pers...

06:23.470 --> 06:25.907
Everyone wants to be
at the top.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.388
If you are willing to do
what it takes to...

06:30.346 --> 06:31.782
I didn't mean to startle you.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.088
I saw the light on.
I figured I'd drop in.

06:33.262 --> 06:34.219
Oh, it's no problem.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.047
Catana Starks, swim coach.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.702
Kendrick Paulsen, Jr.
I'm the new athletic director.

06:38.876 --> 06:40.269
Kendrick Paulsen?

06:40.443 --> 06:42.227
Nice to put a face to the name.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.100
Heard a lot about you.

06:45.274 --> 06:46.623
What have you heard?

06:46.797 --> 06:50.192
Well, 4,500
career-receiving yards.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.976
That was a long time ago.

06:52.150 --> 06:54.762
Yeah,
but it's still impressive.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.851
I can respect what it
takes to be an athlete.

06:57.025 --> 07:00.376
Well, I got out of football
before it got me.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.857
I, uh, didn't need
the injuries,

07:03.031 --> 07:05.163
and I definitely didn't need
the money, so...

07:05.337 --> 07:07.165
Well, yeah,
your dad's pretty loaded.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.124
- He gives a lot of money.
- Thank you.

07:09.298 --> 07:10.995
You...you know, I don't know
how often it gets publicized,

07:11.169 --> 07:14.216
but I left football to
pursue a Master's in business.

07:14.390 --> 07:16.000
I manage portions
of my father's company

07:16.174 --> 07:19.569
so I'm part
of that success too.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.266
Great.

07:22.311 --> 07:23.965
How was your first day?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.836
Unbelievable.

07:26.010 --> 07:29.710
The board wants me to put
together a men's golf team.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.538
Golf?

07:31.712 --> 07:33.365
Yeah, why?

07:33.540 --> 07:36.760
I just...I...I used to play
when I was in college.

07:36.934 --> 07:41.591
I got kind of a sentimental
attachment to the game.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.680
You got any candidates
lined up?

07:43.854 --> 07:46.030
No, not yet.
I'm just getting started.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.385
I'll take it.

07:53.560 --> 07:54.909
Excuse me?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.911
I...I'm just saying
I'm interested.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.347
I'll take it.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
But you've never
coached golf before,

08:00.697 --> 08:02.003
and like I said,
it's our men's team.

08:02.177 --> 08:05.049
I heard you.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.529
Well, if you love the sport
so much,

08:06.703 --> 08:08.226
then why did you stop
playing it?

08:09.967 --> 08:13.231
You know, you got to
devote your life to golf,

08:13.405 --> 08:15.712
and I wasn't gonna half it.

08:15.886 --> 08:19.063
Couldn't find work coaching it,
so I did other things.

08:19.237 --> 08:23.546
Look, I'm just asking
that you consider me, please.

08:28.246 --> 08:29.987
It was a pleasure to meet you.

08:30.161 --> 08:32.555
You too. Welcome.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.165
Thank you.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.474
[instrumental music playing]

08:39.867 --> 08:43.131
Listen...listen, this is a
once in a lifetime opportunity.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.393
You'll start in on the ground
floor and work your way up.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.047
You'll have my support.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.396
You'll have scholarships.
You'll have funding.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.050
You'll have everything
you need.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.617
It's an easy answer.

08:50.791 --> 08:53.315
The question is,
are you in or are you out?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.581
Okay.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.193
Yeah.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.806
All right.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.287
Well, as long as you're out,
you know anyone who coaches
golf?

09:12.464 --> 09:14.379
Just give it to Starks, Ken.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.775
I can't. I don't know if
she can do the job,

09:18.949 --> 09:20.472
and I need someone I feel
comfortable with.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.997
So you're cold calling
country club employees?

09:23.171 --> 09:25.173
I mean, look at her.
She's half my size.

09:25.347 --> 09:28.568
No college athlete's gonna give
her the respect a coach needs.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.787
Starks has been tested
many times.

09:30.961 --> 09:32.484
She has earned it.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.443
With the budget you got,
she's your best option.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.619
She can do more with less.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.800
Night, Roger.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.370
[instrumental music playing]

09:56.117 --> 09:58.336
Thank you.
I can't tell you

09:58.510 --> 10:00.338
how excited
I am to get back to golf.

10:00.512 --> 10:01.905
There's no contract yet.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.125
- We're working out the terms.
- Okay.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.562
I should let you know upfront.
Funding's gonna be tough.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.956
Yeah. Well, funding's always
tough. I'm used to that.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.610
I can't give you scholarships.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
Excuse me?

10:13.743 --> 10:14.744
I'm trying to run
a whole department,

10:14.918 --> 10:16.267
and money's needed elsewhere.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.139
My hands are tied.

10:18.313 --> 10:21.142
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the A.D.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.145
decides how the money gets
spent, and you're the A.D.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.190
so who's hands are tied?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.279
You want the job or not?

10:29.803 --> 10:34.982
Well, since there's no
contract and no funding,

10:35.156 --> 10:38.202
what do you suggest I do next?

10:38.376 --> 10:40.291
Well, there's a desk in the
men's office after you move.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.424
I suggest you hold tryouts.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.949
Right. Thank you.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.777
Uh-huh.

10:53.391 --> 10:58.309
[instrumental music playing]

11:07.014 --> 11:11.671
Uh, Catana Starks,
coach of the TSU golf team.

11:18.547 --> 11:22.159
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.640
I'm with Tennessee State
golf team, and I was just...

11:24.814 --> 11:26.729
I have a full scholarship
at Brantley State.

11:28.296 --> 11:29.732
Okay. Never mind.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.474
No, no.
You can try to pitch to me.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.389
I mean, Brantley's only won
the National Minorities
Championship

11:34.563 --> 11:37.435
five years running. Maybe you
got something to offer too.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
- Who's the coach?
- I am.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.659
[laughing]
You're the coach?

11:46.880 --> 11:50.622
Oh, well tell me
about your school.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.234
The opportunity sounds amazing.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.671
Yes, we are Division One.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.021
We don't have a record yet.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.023
We were just recruiting.
We're starting.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.460
This is something new
we're doing at TSU.

12:06.203 --> 12:07.944
63 strokes?

12:08.118 --> 12:09.032
Yes, ma'am.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.642
When did you shoot that?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.253
Uh, my brother took
me to one of those,

12:12.427 --> 12:15.386
uh, one of the nine
hole courses, and uh,

12:15.560 --> 12:17.301
we were just out there.
Oh, what?

12:17.475 --> 12:20.478
Nine hole?
What about 18?

12:20.652 --> 12:22.480
Well, I mean
there's no problem.
That's just like a what?

12:22.654 --> 12:24.308
A pair of nine holes?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.528
Thank you for your time.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.796
- Morning, sunshine.
- Hey, Roger.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.932
[sighing]
Nobody wants to play here.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.197
Let me tell you something.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.722
I go bowling with a guy
who works at a plant downtown.

12:46.896 --> 12:50.247
Now, he says his kid
back in South Korea

12:50.421 --> 12:51.466
is a golfer.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.295
South Korea? Roger.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.558
I don't even have scholarships.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.908
You know why, don't you?

12:59.082 --> 13:00.475
No. Why?

13:00.649 --> 13:02.912
Don't tell nobody I told you.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.175
Now Winters says to Paulsen,
"Hire Starks.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.699
She's been around,
and she's good with money."

13:07.874 --> 13:09.745
And Paulsen says,
"Well, if she's so good

13:09.919 --> 13:11.747
with money,
she ain't getting any,

13:11.921 --> 13:13.488
and if she wants the job,
she'll deal with it."

13:13.662 --> 13:16.099
You don't say.

13:16.273 --> 13:21.801
[instrumental music playing]

13:24.325 --> 13:26.283
BOB RUSSELL:
That's our guy right there.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.632
[laughing]

13:27.807 --> 13:29.896
Bob, I'm telling you.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.680
You're gonna win some
championships with this kid.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.334
[knocking on door]
Come in.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.902
Kid's on the plane
right now from Dusseldorf.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.425
He's gonna be
our future captain.

13:39.383 --> 13:40.689
He's white.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.691
It's soccer, who cares?

13:42.865 --> 13:45.172
Kid can be neon green
if he plays at TSU

13:45.346 --> 13:47.217
like he does on tape.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.611
Really?

13:49.785 --> 13:51.569
What do you want, Starks?

13:51.743 --> 13:55.182
Oh, well, I was coming over
to let you know where I'm at,

13:55.356 --> 13:57.488
and Bob here is tossing offers
to kids in Europe

13:57.662 --> 14:01.405
for a sport nobody watches,
while I'm begging for bus fare.

14:01.579 --> 14:02.667
Interesting.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.713
Well, it's different.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.454
They've proven they can win.

14:06.628 --> 14:10.240
Really? How? Does he have
lack of funding as well?

14:10.414 --> 14:13.417
Or is his captain on his way
over from Dusseldorf?

14:13.591 --> 14:14.766
Where is he coming from?

14:14.941 --> 14:16.377
[laughing]

14:16.551 --> 14:19.206
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right, bro.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.990
Hey, great job.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.600
Look, Ken.

14:22.774 --> 14:24.994
I'm really trying
to work with you here,

14:25.168 --> 14:29.042
but I cannot do my job if
I don't have the tools, okay?

14:29.216 --> 14:31.522
And like I said,
I don't half anything.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.655
All right, fine, fine, fine.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.138
Scholarships, right?

14:38.312 --> 14:39.966
Yeah.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.490
Now, you'll get
your scholarships.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.535
Thank you.

14:44.709 --> 14:50.454
[instrumental music playing]

14:50.628 --> 14:51.803
You get what you wanted?

14:51.978 --> 14:54.110
- And then some.
- There you go.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.245
- Hey, how's it going?
- Hi.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.465
- What's your name?
- Oh, Craig, Craig. Sorry.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.250
Are those MacGregor's?

15:03.424 --> 15:05.208
Yeah. I know they aren't
brand-new or anything,

15:05.382 --> 15:07.167
but they play great. Yeah.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.604
I take 'em out after
caddying and hit a few
or a lot.

15:09.778 --> 15:10.822
I played a lot.

15:10.997 --> 15:13.260
What's your best stroke count?

15:13.434 --> 15:14.783
67.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.394
On a real course?

15:17.568 --> 15:19.005
Yeah.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.269
Congratulations,
you made the team.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.488
Oh, wow.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.101
CATANA: No, no, no.
Don't ask your best player.

15:28.275 --> 15:31.495
I don't want him
if he doesn't want me.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.454
Look, I know this
may sound crazy,

15:33.628 --> 15:37.458
but who do you have
in terms of black caddies?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.114
No, just caddies.
[knock at door]

15:44.682 --> 15:48.425
Okay.
Thank you...for nothing.

15:48.599 --> 15:52.864
Craig, you might be
the last of a dying breed.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.955
Uh, what do you mean
a dying breed?

15:56.129 --> 15:58.131
Well, ever since
Tiger made golf hot,

15:58.305 --> 15:59.654
all the well-to-do white kids
don't mind taking

15:59.828 --> 16:01.438
all the caddy jobs.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.311
Yeah, definitely. I mean,
I almost didn't get mine

16:04.485 --> 16:05.921
because of all the competition,

16:06.095 --> 16:07.531
and there aren't really
a lot of spots.

16:07.705 --> 16:09.403
I mean, most of the clubs
use golf carts now.

16:09.577 --> 16:10.491
I mean, my high school didn't
exactly have enough money

16:10.665 --> 16:12.406
for a team so...

16:12.580 --> 16:13.755
Excuse me.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.105
- Yes, hello.
- Hi.

16:16.279 --> 16:20.327
Do you know where I can
find Mr. Bob Russell?

16:20.501 --> 16:23.373
Oh, uh, yeah.
He's out by the field.

16:23.547 --> 16:28.117
Look, why don't you take him,
show him to the field.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.554
Yeah, sure.

16:30.728 --> 16:33.731
- Uh, I'm Craig.
- Guttentag.

16:33.905 --> 16:35.820
Right, okay.
Well, come on then.

16:37.257 --> 16:40.695
If Bob's going international,
so am I.

16:40.869 --> 16:45.656
[instrumental music playing]

16:55.971 --> 16:58.887
Yeah, I heard you're one of
the best clubs in the area.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.933
I wish I had a strategy,
but I...I'm just tossing
up a prayer

17:02.108 --> 17:04.110
that you got
somebody I can use.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.373
Name that comes to
mind is Cameron Ward.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.375
He's been a caddy
for six years,

17:08.549 --> 17:10.290
lives paycheck to paycheck
to support his mom,

17:10.464 --> 17:13.293
but uh, she wants
an education for him.

17:13.467 --> 17:15.208
Great. Who else?

17:15.382 --> 17:18.602
Cam's the only one I know.
Hold on a minute.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.170
Former student of mine is
a pro in the London area.

17:21.344 --> 17:23.607
I'll get you a number.
He can help.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.656
No, I can't help.

17:28.830 --> 17:29.744
All of our caddies have offers,

17:29.918 --> 17:31.267
believe it or not.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.706
Good God.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.713
That's what I'm talking about!

17:42.887 --> 17:47.283
Hey, Starks, you tell me
you're looking for anybody?

17:48.937 --> 17:50.765
Uh, yeah.
What's the country code again?

17:50.939 --> 17:55.596
[speaking French]

17:57.554 --> 17:58.947
Scholarship!

17:59.121 --> 18:04.648
Bassam! Bassam! Scholarship!

18:07.173 --> 18:09.175
I apologize
I could not get away.

18:09.349 --> 18:10.611
I do not get
very much time off.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.613
That's okay.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.616
And the noise,
it can get very loud in here.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.835
Oh, no problem.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.142
Man, you should see me
in action.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.798
This is Ji-Kyung.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.452
He's kind of young.

18:25.626 --> 18:26.844
Oh, no.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.455
That's just a very old photo.

18:28.629 --> 18:29.586
He is 18 now.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.022
And he golfs?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.459
Yes.
I get letters all the time.

18:32.633 --> 18:35.636
He wins tournaments,
competitions.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.464
Why would he want to come
all the way from South Korea

18:37.638 --> 18:38.900
to Tennessee State?

18:39.074 --> 18:40.684
No, no.
He's in California now.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.818
His mother brought him
here when he was very small,

18:43.992 --> 18:46.995
but he needs
to be here with me.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.824
He does not know his culture.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.434
He has yellow hair.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.001
Excuse me?

18:53.175 --> 18:55.046
He put bleach on his hair.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.265
[laughing]

18:56.439 --> 18:57.832
He wears earrings.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.921
He does things his own way.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.010
Yeah, I like him already.

19:04.447 --> 19:10.149
[music playing]

19:23.510 --> 19:25.729
Excuse me, love.
Is this Lincoln Hall?

19:25.903 --> 19:27.514
Yeah, this is Lincoln.

19:27.688 --> 19:28.732
Hey, where are you from?

19:28.906 --> 19:30.386
Don't tell me you can't tell

19:30.560 --> 19:32.736
a classy British accent
when you hear one.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.130
I'm looking for my room.
Uh, 102.

19:35.304 --> 19:36.740
Are you sure you
got the right place?

19:36.914 --> 19:38.525
Lincoln's almost all athletes.

19:38.699 --> 19:39.961
What's that supposed to mean?

19:40.135 --> 19:41.702
I don't look like
an athlete to you?

19:41.876 --> 19:43.921
That's rich coming from
you with that book bag.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.706
What are you talking about?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.404
Athletes don't study,

19:48.578 --> 19:50.754
and they definitely aren't
so easy on the eye.

19:52.016 --> 19:55.542
Um, uh, 102's on the right.

19:55.716 --> 19:57.631
- Right here?
- Yeah.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.415
Thank you.

20:02.505 --> 20:07.075
[music playing]

20:19.696 --> 20:22.264
I'm Edward,
the uh, other roommate.

21:17.232 --> 21:19.278
You okay?
You look lost.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.673
Yeah.
I hope I'm not losing the plot,

21:23.847 --> 21:25.240
but the bloke just dropped me
off in the middle of nowhere.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.024
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
I hear an accent.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.548
You must be
one of Starks' guys?

21:28.722 --> 21:30.245
- Yeah.
- What are you doing out here?

21:30.419 --> 21:33.030
You supposed to be at
the International House.

21:33.204 --> 21:34.858
Come on. I'll show you.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.469
Well, that makes sense.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.340
I thought someone
had made a mistake.

21:38.514 --> 21:40.037
Uh, I hope you don't mind
me saying,

21:40.211 --> 21:41.038
but I feel a bit
out of place here.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.866
[laughing] No kidding.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.523
Get up there.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.309
Hello?

21:51.005 --> 21:53.224
Oh, the bloody pom's arrived.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.052
Good day, mate.
I'm Cameron.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.750
You must be Edward, huh?
First to meet ya.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.579
- You're an Aussie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah indeed.

21:59.753 --> 22:02.625
What's, uh,
what's this all about?

22:02.799 --> 22:06.020
Oh, I got
a couple for the house
actually, for all the boys.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.500
You want to hit a few?

22:09.545 --> 22:11.155
Doesn't practice
start tomorrow morning?

22:11.330 --> 22:13.636
Yeah, mate. Ooh, it actually
starts in a few hours.

22:13.810 --> 22:16.509
Gonna get some practice in.
You know what I mean?

22:21.209 --> 22:25.344
[music playing]

22:30.261 --> 22:31.915
What's going on, man?

22:32.089 --> 22:33.090
Oh, sorry mate. I...

22:33.264 --> 22:34.788
Oh, you Edward, right?

22:34.962 --> 22:37.834
Yeah, yeah. I'm, uh, I'm gonna
get some sleep.

22:38.008 --> 22:41.577
All right, then.
I'll hit you up in the morning.

22:41.751 --> 22:46.147
You...you playing on the...
don't worry about it.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.105
I'll see you in the morning.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.020
Yeah, no sweat brother.

22:50.194 --> 22:54.198
[instrumental music playing]

23:00.422 --> 23:02.250
Okay.
Let's get it together folks.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.947
First tournament
is this weekend.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.253
We got a lot
of ground to cover.

23:05.427 --> 23:07.211
I need you over here.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.865
Can you get up, please?

23:09.039 --> 23:10.563
Excuse me.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.565
Hello, Crook and Castles,
whatever.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.523
Turn around, please.
How you doing?

23:14.697 --> 23:16.003
Take that out.

23:17.439 --> 23:19.267
My name is Catana Starks.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.574
I guess you figured
by now I'm the coach.

23:21.748 --> 23:25.752
You are the Tennessee State
men's golf team.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.536
By the way, this is the
last time some of you

23:27.710 --> 23:30.713
will come to practice
dressed like this.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.628
Start with an easy one.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.849
You're on the golf course,
but you're not on the green.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.982
You're in one of two places,
the fairway or the rough.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.507
Or it could be a water hazard.

23:41.681 --> 23:44.118
Fine.
There are three places.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.424
Well, actually
might be a sand trap.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.862
Okay, look.
Let's start over.

23:49.036 --> 23:50.951
You're on a golf course.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.735
You tee off.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.346
You're either in the fairway
or in the rough.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.479
Where would you rather be?

23:58.741 --> 24:00.395
Uh, fairway.

24:00.569 --> 24:03.964
In golf, yes.
In life, no.

24:04.138 --> 24:05.574
Fairways are easy.

24:05.748 --> 24:08.795
If your life is a fairway,
you get soft.

24:08.969 --> 24:12.755
What I love is that none
of you come from fairways,

24:12.929 --> 24:16.237
and that is good by me because
I need toughness on this team.

24:17.891 --> 24:20.197
Start with your name
and where you're from.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.199
Ji-Kyung, South Korea.

24:22.373 --> 24:23.766
I'm sorry.
One more time.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.899
Ji-Kyung.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.510
Y'all can call me Young G.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.686
Young G?

24:30.860 --> 24:31.861
Yeah.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.124
Like Ali, Tupac.

24:37.954 --> 24:41.828
Um, Cameron from
Brisbane Queensland, Australia.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.394
Thank you. Next.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.615
Uh, Craig, Atlanta, Georgia.

24:46.789 --> 24:50.227
Yeah, am I the only
black person on the team?

24:50.401 --> 24:53.579
Well, not unless you count
Young Jeezie, Weezie,
what was it?

24:53.753 --> 24:55.058
Young G.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.234
Not unless you count
Young G here.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.062
Why? Is that an issue?

25:00.107 --> 25:01.848
Uh, no.

25:02.022 --> 25:04.154
Okay. Pass the ball back.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.157
Thank you.

25:10.291 --> 25:13.033
Bassam. I'm Algerian.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.949
You're from Paris, right?

25:16.123 --> 25:18.125
I'm Algerian.

25:21.258 --> 25:24.044
Edward, London.
Look, love. Is this some
sort of punishment?

25:24.218 --> 25:25.915
No, love.
This is the first of

25:26.089 --> 25:29.310
15 exercises that we are doing
to improve core strength

25:29.484 --> 25:30.877
and shoulder flexibility.
Pass it back.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.183
Sorry, you said
the first exercise.

25:33.357 --> 25:34.663
- Yes.
- Of 15?

25:34.837 --> 25:36.404
Correct.

25:41.235 --> 25:45.195
Yeah, I wouldn't do
that if I were you Edward.

25:45.369 --> 25:48.547
Because for every one you don't
do, your teammates do double.

25:52.463 --> 25:57.773
[instrumental music playing]

25:59.470 --> 26:02.082
When's the first time you
picked up your first golf club?

26:02.256 --> 26:03.910
I was about 12.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.215
Where were you?

26:05.389 --> 26:07.696
Wimbledon Park Golf Club.

26:07.870 --> 26:09.393
Who gave 'em to you?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.613
No one.
I nicked them.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.313
You nicked them?
You stole them?

26:18.838 --> 26:20.143
From who?

26:20.317 --> 26:22.232
I don't know.
Some rich prick.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.973
Called me a pikey.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.062
What's a pikey?

26:26.236 --> 26:28.369
Like scum.

26:31.415 --> 26:35.637
Kid calls you scum
so you stole?

26:45.560 --> 26:46.909
Hey.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.476
Oh, hey.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.956
So you didn't move
into 102, huh?

26:50.130 --> 26:51.958
Athlete?

26:52.132 --> 26:53.612
Are you keeping tabs on me now?

26:53.786 --> 26:55.309
No. I just know those guys,
and they said

26:55.483 --> 26:57.572
you showed up and left.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.792
Yeah, yeah.
The golfers... we all got
a house together now.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.577
- Oh.
- Since you know the athletes,

27:02.751 --> 27:04.623
is it normal to have
an hour and a half workout

27:04.797 --> 27:06.581
in your first training session?
I didn't even pick up a club.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.627
I got a medicine ball
straight in my chest.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.629
- Then Coach Starks, she said--
- Starks?

27:10.803 --> 27:12.892
- You know her?
- Yeah, she's my coach.

27:13.066 --> 27:16.156
Oh. You didn't tell me
you're a golfer.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.158
- I'm a swimmer.
- What?

27:18.332 --> 27:19.855
- A swimmer?
- Yeah.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.204
She's a swim coach?
We're being taught golf

27:21.378 --> 27:22.858
by a lady swim coach.

27:23.032 --> 27:24.686
No, I mean...
yeah, she was my swim coach

27:24.860 --> 27:26.906
but she was never
a great swimmer.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.385
Well, that's a relief.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.649
I'm saying it doesn't matter.

27:30.823 --> 27:34.217
She wasn't a swimmer either,
and we won seven conference
titles.

27:34.391 --> 27:39.701
Look, give her a chance,
plus TSU is a good school.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.836
Besides, where would you
be if you weren't here?

27:44.010 --> 27:46.534
I don't know,
routing school, prison.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.970
Where are you going, girl?

27:48.144 --> 27:49.406
Class.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.017
You work way too hard.

27:51.191 --> 27:52.714
Yeah, yeah.

28:03.856 --> 28:06.989
Hang on a sec.
These are our new clubs, right?

28:07.163 --> 28:08.469
Coach, seriously.
You know, I can go and steal us

28:08.643 --> 28:09.992
some nice ones if you want.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.125
[laughing]

28:12.299 --> 28:15.215
I told the guys that the school
would be providing the clubs,

28:15.389 --> 28:16.477
and we get these?

28:16.651 --> 28:18.174
What's the problem Starks?

28:18.348 --> 28:20.089
They're horrible.
That's the problem.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.961
Look, how are we supposed to
compete with other schools

28:22.135 --> 28:25.268
when we have woods that are
actually made of wood?

28:25.442 --> 28:26.879
I gave you scholarships,
didn't I?

28:27.053 --> 28:29.185
- Yes. And thank you.
- Good luck.

28:29.359 --> 28:30.883
We still...

28:35.670 --> 28:37.280
What were you saying
about being Algerian?

28:37.454 --> 28:38.629
What did you mean by that?

28:38.804 --> 28:41.197
- I am.
- You sound French.

28:41.371 --> 28:42.372
Algerian!

28:42.546 --> 28:44.200
Okay. All right. Let's go.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.202
Everybody, let's get started.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.248
Find a stall.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.644
You do not expect
me to use this, huh?

28:53.819 --> 28:54.994
Do you?

28:55.429 --> 28:57.300
For now, I do.

28:57.474 --> 29:00.260
And let's see if you can golf
as well as you mouth off.

29:00.434 --> 29:01.478
You're up first.

29:01.652 --> 29:04.481
No, someone else goes first.

29:04.655 --> 29:05.874
I play when I feel like it.

29:06.048 --> 29:08.616
No, you play
when I feel like it!

29:08.790 --> 29:11.880
Get a club. Here's a ball.
Let's go.

29:32.466 --> 29:36.122
[instrumental music playing]

29:36.296 --> 29:37.210
You're such a French man.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.473
Algerian.

29:39.647 --> 29:42.693
Look, cool it with
the attitude, okay?

29:42.868 --> 29:44.086
Who's next?

29:44.260 --> 29:47.786
[instrumental music playing]

29:50.049 --> 29:52.442
That camera's like
mad old school.

29:53.530 --> 29:56.620
Yeah? It does the job.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.797
Wait. Pull your pants up.

30:00.102 --> 30:02.017
Oh, man. That's my thang.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.933
Yeah? Well, your thang is gonna
get in the way of your swang.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.500
Pull your pants up!

30:06.674 --> 30:07.806
That's why they call
'em undergarments.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.938
They belong under your clothes.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.115
The great thing about golf is

30:13.289 --> 30:15.248
that if you watch the greats,
Nicholas and Hogan

30:15.422 --> 30:16.902
and Sam Snead, Walter Hagen,

30:17.076 --> 30:18.555
Greg Norman...
he's a man who eyes a ball.

30:20.209 --> 30:23.604
That's why you have
to bend your knees!

30:23.778 --> 30:25.824
Where did you learn to play?

30:25.998 --> 30:26.999
On my street.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.478
Well we're gonna get the street

30:28.652 --> 30:29.828
out of your game right now.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.481
Bend your knees.
Bend your knees.

30:31.655 --> 30:32.700
That's harassment.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.093
Oh, shut up and swing already.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.573
Come on, let's go.
Keep it loose.

30:36.747 --> 30:38.271
You see some of the tricks

30:38.445 --> 30:40.012
and then try and incorporate
'em in your game.

30:40.186 --> 30:44.277
Cameron. What is it that you do
besides golf?

30:44.451 --> 30:46.888
Well, I mean...

30:49.325 --> 30:51.893
yeah, uh...

30:55.723 --> 30:58.378
See?
Works every time.

30:58.552 --> 31:00.815
Is that a chain? Give me that
chain out of your pocket.

31:00.989 --> 31:03.862
Give me that.
This ain't no rap video.

31:05.341 --> 31:06.865
Robbing me.

31:15.699 --> 31:19.703
Now, why don't you hit like
that when your teammates
are around?

31:19.878 --> 31:23.316
Craig, you're good. Okay?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.100
Know it.

31:26.362 --> 31:28.408
Go ahead.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.367
[music playing]

31:31.541 --> 31:33.456
[bang]

31:33.630 --> 31:37.417
JI-KYUNG: I need you to stop.
I need you to hear me.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.901
[hits table]

31:43.075 --> 31:46.382
No, look!
This is the way I talk, okay?

31:46.556 --> 31:50.038
This is the way I dress,
how I act. This is me.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.607
No, no, you listen to me.

31:53.781 --> 31:56.262
I don't care about my given
name. This is my culture.

31:56.436 --> 31:57.916
This is me.

32:00.614 --> 32:04.487
Yeah? Well, you weren't there
so I had to, but you know what?

32:04.661 --> 32:06.576
That was fine by me, okay?

32:09.623 --> 32:12.452
[instrumental music playing]

32:12.626 --> 32:17.674
[indiscreet chatter]

32:46.094 --> 32:48.531
Coach Starks?
Tennessee State?

32:48.705 --> 32:50.403
- Yeah.
- Hank Taylor, Vandenberg.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.535
Looks like your boys and mine
are goin' head to head

32:52.709 --> 32:54.624
quite a bit today.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.191
Look, I want you
to meet Spielman,

32:56.365 --> 32:58.454
best All-American
captain in the country.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.630
- Nice to meet you, Coach.
- Nice to meet you.

33:00.804 --> 33:03.894
Now, let me show you
all around, make you
feel comfortable.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.896
You try this new Ping driver?

33:06.071 --> 33:07.855
- What?
- This new Ping driver?

33:08.029 --> 33:10.423
Been hitting the ball 300 yards
every time with this baby.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.033
You know in all my years,

33:12.207 --> 33:14.340
I have never once recruited
internationally.

33:14.514 --> 33:16.342
Of course,
then again I never had to.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.518
Vandenberg just got
this new golf simulator.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.389
Golf simulator?

33:20.563 --> 33:21.782
Yeah, you know, one of
those screens you hit into?

33:21.956 --> 33:23.610
Measures your yard
and accuracy?

33:23.784 --> 33:25.351
You got a screen you hit
balls in to measure your yards?

33:25.525 --> 33:26.961
Do y'all not have one of those?

33:27.135 --> 33:28.484
HANK:
Beautiful day for golf, Coach.

33:28.658 --> 33:30.182
Good luck,
and I'll see you out there.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.359
Vandenberg's got one.
We've had one since...

33:33.533 --> 33:35.752
Sorry, mate,
what's this Vandenberg?

33:35.926 --> 33:37.450
Vandenberg University?

33:37.624 --> 33:39.321
Literally ten minutes
away from your school.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.019
Really?

33:41.193 --> 33:42.716
What a difference
ten minutes makes.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.457
Our clubs are crap.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.024
Well, good luck, buddy.

33:48.722 --> 33:50.028
What a nob head.

33:50.202 --> 33:54.684
[instrumental music playing]

34:29.197 --> 34:32.635
Edward!
The best approach is this.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.769
Yeah, maybe,
but I want to go across.

34:35.943 --> 34:36.770
Get onto green one.

34:36.944 --> 34:37.988
Trust me, Edward.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.381
I scouted this course already.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.383
It's longer than it looks.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.733
Oh yeah? Watch this.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.139
Bugger!

35:20.596 --> 35:22.294
Ugh! Ugh!

35:40.921 --> 35:42.966
Well done.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.449
Make this par and we tie
with Vandenberg, don't we?

35:47.623 --> 35:49.582
Stupid.

35:49.756 --> 35:50.626
If he doesn't make this shot,
we don't tie for last.

35:50.800 --> 35:52.889
Shh!

36:34.888 --> 36:36.933
What happened back there?

36:38.892 --> 36:40.198
- Sorry.
- Craig?

36:40.372 --> 36:42.200
I'll get to you in a minute.

36:44.550 --> 36:45.986
Hello?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.857
Somebody say something?

36:48.031 --> 36:49.772
Spielman,
he's the best in America.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.426
No, he's not.

36:51.600 --> 36:52.819
Well, the coach said
when we turned up,

36:52.993 --> 36:53.950
he said an All-American,
best golfer.

36:54.124 --> 36:55.909
He's the best captain.

36:56.083 --> 36:59.652
Shawn Howard at Brantley State
is the best overall player,

36:59.826 --> 37:02.655
another Tiger Woods.
Picked up a golf club
before he could walk.

37:02.829 --> 37:05.484
But there were no super
stars like that out there!

37:05.658 --> 37:08.965
Just teams of guys
playing together,

37:09.139 --> 37:12.752
and we better learn how to
do that and fast!

37:12.926 --> 37:15.102
Maybe the fact that you're
not actually a golf coach.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.887
You're a ladies swim coach.

37:18.061 --> 37:20.455
- Excuse me?
- I met a girl that said

37:20.629 --> 37:22.196
you coached
ladies swimming last year.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.720
- And?
- WAITRESS: Here you go.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.940
Y'all some kind of sports team?

37:27.114 --> 37:28.071
We thought we were.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.943
Well, you look darling.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.815
And you the bus driver?

37:32.989 --> 37:34.643
I'm the coach.

37:34.817 --> 37:38.386
[laughing] Sure, sugar,
and I own this restaurant.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.845
If I am just a ladies'
swim coach, Edward...

38:03.019 --> 38:04.630
...then you're nothing
but street trash

38:04.804 --> 38:06.893
like that rich kid said.

38:07.067 --> 38:10.592
But I don't say that, because
I don't focus on the past!

38:10.766 --> 38:13.247
I focus on potential!

38:13.421 --> 38:16.337
And I work hard
to realize mine!

38:16.511 --> 38:18.426
And I expect the same of you!

38:21.081 --> 38:24.519
Now whether that ignorant
waitress gets what I'm doing,

38:24.693 --> 38:26.042
doesn't matter.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.697
I'm gonna make you a golfer!

38:28.871 --> 38:30.438
All of you!

38:32.048 --> 38:33.528
And we're gonna win!

38:35.269 --> 38:37.706
You were gonna say something
before all of this nonsense?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.622
Just, uh, sorry.

38:40.796 --> 38:41.928
Speak up!

38:42.102 --> 38:44.017
I'm sorry. I...I choked.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.106
Yeah? And why was that?

38:47.716 --> 38:50.066
I...I don't know.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.894
I don't know.
Look, I'm sorry.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.461
I'll tell you why.

38:53.635 --> 38:56.899
Soft bigotry
of low expectations.

38:57.073 --> 38:59.119
People expecting you to fail

38:59.293 --> 39:01.687
so they lower the bar
to help you over

39:01.861 --> 39:03.906
like you're some dumb,
poor, black kid

39:04.080 --> 39:06.779
who doesn't know the difference
between a driver and a putter!

39:06.953 --> 39:07.867
Yeah, well that's not true.

39:08.041 --> 39:08.998
I know it's not, Craig!

39:09.172 --> 39:10.826
I've seen you hit!

39:11.000 --> 39:12.437
You're incredible!

39:12.611 --> 39:14.047
But you get around
your opponents

39:14.221 --> 39:16.876
and even your own teammates,
and you choke!

39:17.050 --> 39:19.922
'Cause you second-guess
yourself!

39:20.096 --> 39:22.795
Craig, you're no different
than these guys, okay?

39:22.969 --> 39:24.666
Okay?

39:24.840 --> 39:28.104
Cameron here, he has the same
training as you,

39:28.278 --> 39:30.280
and Edward before he got here,

39:30.455 --> 39:33.719
his driving range
was a long alleyway.

39:33.893 --> 39:36.678
And King Bassam over here
has never played in a big time

39:36.852 --> 39:39.768
tournament
despite his big time attitude!

39:39.942 --> 39:41.596
What about me?

39:43.076 --> 39:45.165
I don't know, Young G.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.559
You're something else
all together.

39:47.733 --> 39:50.910
Look! My point is,
there are no excuses!

39:51.084 --> 39:54.522
You don't have any excuses so
get that out your head, okay?

39:54.696 --> 39:58.352
We are all...all of us,
including me...

39:58.526 --> 40:01.399
...somebody else's
table scraps.

40:01.573 --> 40:05.141
But that tournament...
that tournament was bad!

40:05.315 --> 40:07.927
Even by table scrap standards!

40:09.711 --> 40:10.930
Better get your head
in the game!

40:11.104 --> 40:13.193
Get in the van!

40:15.238 --> 40:19.155
[indiscreet chatter]

40:24.160 --> 40:27.294
Let's try something, Craig.
Everybody, pay attention.

40:29.862 --> 40:32.342
Come on, I have to put
looking at Young G's shoes?

40:32.517 --> 40:34.562
You got a problem
with my shoes?

40:36.042 --> 40:40.612
If you're getting distracted,
try closing your eyes.

40:42.309 --> 40:43.919
Okay, now what?

40:44.093 --> 40:45.965
Now putt.

40:46.139 --> 40:47.357
Come on, really?

40:47.532 --> 40:48.881
You know,
Johnny Miller, did it.

40:49.055 --> 40:50.230
He's the last PGA
winner at Pebble Beach.

40:52.014 --> 40:53.929
Look, just give it a try.
It's for a good reason.

40:54.103 --> 40:56.018
I promise.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.458
Slow down.
Line the shot up.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.983
- And no cheating.
- I'm not.

41:04.157 --> 41:06.638
Similar to Luke Skywalker
using the force type stuff.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.989
Ooh, a black kid that
golfs who's also a nerd.

41:10.163 --> 41:12.121
What a surprise?

41:12.295 --> 41:14.036
All right, fair enough.

41:17.213 --> 41:19.128
- All right, focus.
- Okay.

41:25.178 --> 41:26.571
- You missed.
- Yeah, I know.

41:26.745 --> 41:29.138
Hey, look.
Where did the ball end up?

41:29.312 --> 41:30.792
I...I don't know.
My eyes were closed.

41:30.966 --> 41:31.924
- KENDRICK: Starks!
- Keep your eyes shut.

41:32.098 --> 41:32.881
Have you seen today's paper?

41:33.055 --> 41:34.492
Hold on, please.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.058
You saw where it was
supposed to go.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.973
You felt how you hit it.
Is it short or long?

41:38.147 --> 41:40.976
Um, I think long?

41:41.150 --> 41:43.370
How long?

41:43.544 --> 41:45.677
- Maybe about a foot or two.
- Left or right?

41:47.200 --> 41:51.160
Uh, right about a foot.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.077
Open your eyes, Craig.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.080
- I was right?
- Yes.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.255
Remember this.

41:59.429 --> 42:01.388
It's you and the ball, okay?

42:01.562 --> 42:03.042
Don't worry about
who you're playing.

42:03.216 --> 42:04.522
Forget about the score.

42:04.696 --> 42:07.829
It's you, the ball
and the green.

42:08.003 --> 42:09.309
Got it?

42:09.483 --> 42:11.267
- Got it.
- Yes, Coach.

42:11.441 --> 42:13.618
Excuse me.
Just take five, okay?

42:18.405 --> 42:20.102
So nice of you
to come out, Ken.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.801
Your team's all over the
back page of the city paper.

42:22.975 --> 42:25.847
Last place in a field
of 30 teams?

42:26.021 --> 42:27.588
I can't wait for the calls
to start rolling in,

42:27.762 --> 42:29.808
"Why is your team so bad
and why are they so white?"

42:29.982 --> 42:31.113
Oh, come on, Ken.

42:31.287 --> 42:33.115
No one cares about that,
remember?

42:33.289 --> 42:34.856
It's one thing to have a few
white guys on the soccer team,

42:35.030 --> 42:37.119
and they win. It's another
to lose so bad it's news.

42:37.293 --> 42:39.208
You bring in these players
from all over the world,

42:39.382 --> 42:41.036
and they play like that?

42:41.210 --> 42:44.562
Ken, you act like all the good
black golfers in the USA

42:44.736 --> 42:47.260
was knocking down my door,
and I said no.

42:47.434 --> 42:49.697
These guys are the best
I could do. Okay?

42:49.871 --> 42:51.046
I'm sorry if it's
an embarrassment.

42:51.220 --> 42:53.135
It is.

42:53.309 --> 42:55.007
I just sent out the paperwork

42:55.181 --> 42:57.705
for the National Collegiate
Minority Championship.

42:57.879 --> 43:01.274
The PGA sponsors it,
it's important.

43:01.448 --> 43:03.755
Mark it on your calendar now...

43:03.929 --> 43:06.192
...so you don't blow that one,
too.

43:17.246 --> 43:20.902
Good day, love. All right, so
uh, what is on the menu today?

43:21.076 --> 43:22.295
Oh, you'll love the gumbo.

43:22.469 --> 43:23.905
It's got onions,
celery, shellfish.

43:24.079 --> 43:28.475
Oh, sorry.
Yeah, can't eat shellfish.

43:28.649 --> 43:30.695
Maybe try
the clam chowder then.

43:30.869 --> 43:33.001
No. Sorry, no.

43:33.175 --> 43:37.136
I just...I really can't eat
any shellfish whatsoever.

43:37.310 --> 43:38.659
I heard you. Don't worry.

43:38.833 --> 43:39.921
We don't put real
clams in the chowder.

43:40.095 --> 43:41.749
You don't?

43:45.361 --> 43:47.276
What
do you put in it?

43:51.541 --> 43:53.631
I'll just get dessert.

43:55.371 --> 43:56.895
Hey, Bassam, mate, how are you?

43:57.069 --> 43:58.157
Bassam.

43:58.331 --> 44:00.289
Oh, sorry, mate, yeah.

44:00.463 --> 44:02.204
Listen,
I meant to ask you about
what Coach Starks was saying

44:02.378 --> 44:04.293
about your... Cheers.

44:04.467 --> 44:06.295
About you never having played
in any big tournaments before.

44:06.469 --> 44:08.080
- Hey!
- Listen bastard,

44:08.254 --> 44:10.648
I didn't play in a big
tournament because I can't!

44:10.822 --> 44:12.475
My government won't let me!

44:12.650 --> 44:14.695
The French racists that treat
my people like this!

44:16.175 --> 44:18.394
Stop! Bassam, calm down!

44:18.568 --> 44:19.961
What is going on here?

44:20.135 --> 44:21.659
Nothing, I was just...

44:21.833 --> 44:22.660
Listen, I was just trying
to say that I think...

44:22.834 --> 44:24.139
Whatever you were saying,

44:24.313 --> 44:25.793
I probably wouldn't start
saying it again.

44:25.967 --> 44:27.055
I don't think it
was doing the trick, alright?

44:27.229 --> 44:28.666
- Just leave it.
- Forget him!

44:30.145 --> 44:31.843
He'll never understand.

44:38.893 --> 44:40.895
- What is going on?
- I have no idea.

44:41.069 --> 44:42.331
I'm clueless.

44:42.505 --> 44:43.985
Do you need
to go sit with them?

44:44.159 --> 44:46.161
No, no. It'll work out.
It'll be all right.

44:46.335 --> 44:49.077
Sorry. Forget about that.
What's going on tonight?

44:49.251 --> 44:52.341
Um, there's a, um, frat
party tonight Phi Beta Tau.

44:52.515 --> 44:53.952
Ah, okay. Splendid.
Sounds good.

44:54.126 --> 44:55.736
Yeah.

44:55.910 --> 44:58.826
Um, Edward,
can I ask you something?

44:59.000 --> 45:02.047
Of course, anything.
What is it?

45:02.221 --> 45:05.137
What are you
expectations with all this?

45:05.311 --> 45:06.616
Sorry, expectations?

45:06.791 --> 45:08.140
Yeah.

45:08.314 --> 45:10.011
Why do we need to have
expectations?

45:10.185 --> 45:12.971
Why can't we just be,
you know, having a good time?

45:13.145 --> 45:16.844
Well, it depends on what
you consider a good time.

45:17.018 --> 45:18.759
Come on. We're only going
to one little party.

45:18.933 --> 45:20.195
That's it.

45:20.369 --> 45:22.067
All right.

The National Minority
Championship,

45:39.606 --> 45:42.087
the most important invitational
of the year shutting you out.

45:42.261 --> 45:44.132
On what grounds?

45:44.306 --> 45:45.917
On what grounds? You only have
one black player on your team.

45:46.091 --> 45:49.485
Hold on! It's called
the Minority Championship

45:49.659 --> 45:51.400
because of minority schools,
not the players.

45:51.574 --> 45:53.402
The players don't matter!

45:53.576 --> 45:55.883
Well, apparently they do.

45:58.233 --> 46:01.454
Uh. You're telling me that
the president of the PGA

46:01.628 --> 46:03.238
handled it personally?

46:03.412 --> 46:05.763
- That's right.
- Well, may I speak with him?

46:05.937 --> 46:08.461
I'm sorry.
He's not available.

46:08.635 --> 46:10.506
Look, from one lady to another,

46:10.680 --> 46:13.858
my is on the line
if I don't straighten this
out, okay?

46:14.032 --> 46:15.685
Well, he is speaking
at Vandenberg today.

46:15.860 --> 46:17.252
Wait, he's still there?

46:17.426 --> 46:19.646
- That's correct.
- For how long?

46:19.820 --> 46:22.127
I think it's remarkable
to look out

46:22.301 --> 46:24.912
and see so many young people,

46:25.086 --> 46:27.697
any of whom could be
a future winner

46:27.872 --> 46:30.526
of the U.S. Open
or The Masters.

46:32.441 --> 46:36.663
This game of golf
that we share,
builds character.

46:40.058 --> 46:41.581

Tennessee State University.

46:45.628 --> 46:46.934
I was just wondering--

46:47.108 --> 46:49.371
I read your application
personally.

46:49.545 --> 46:50.720
The answer is no!

46:50.895 --> 46:52.766
Why?
What's the reason?

46:52.940 --> 46:55.900
The reason, ESPN's
breathing down my neck

46:56.074 --> 46:57.510
for quotes on a story
they're doing

46:57.684 --> 47:00.121
about the lack of
black golfers in the PGA.

47:00.295 --> 47:02.341
They'd have a field day
if I let your team

47:02.515 --> 47:04.386
into our minority tournament.

47:04.560 --> 47:06.258
I could lose my job.

47:06.432 --> 47:08.216
Don't you find it
interesting that in the 70's,

47:08.390 --> 47:10.305
there were ten African
Americans on the PGA tour.

47:10.479 --> 47:13.482
Today, one, and it's
because of the caddy system.

47:13.656 --> 47:15.267
What do you mean?

47:15.441 --> 47:18.139
Look, there are no
African American caddies.

47:18.313 --> 47:21.621
The field is dead, so I
went with who I could find.

47:21.795 --> 47:23.623
Did you even read
my application

47:23.797 --> 47:25.581
to see where
I got these guys from?

47:25.755 --> 47:27.366
They're not all white,

47:27.540 --> 47:30.586
and these kids did not have
a shot anywhere else.

47:30.760 --> 47:34.373
But if you want to turn your
back on them and shut them out,

47:34.547 --> 47:38.638
and me, the only female head
coach, well then you do that.

47:38.812 --> 47:40.509
But I thought the
goal was diversity.

47:40.683 --> 47:43.730
Don't do that.
It's more complicated
than that.

47:43.904 --> 47:45.427
It doesn't have to be.

47:45.601 --> 47:46.951
You don't get it.

47:47.125 --> 47:48.604
I still have to answer
to the media!

47:48.778 --> 47:51.216
So you tell them the truth,
the full story.

47:51.390 --> 47:54.436
They're always looking
to make it about race anyway.

47:54.610 --> 47:59.311
But we all know that it is way
deeper than that, isn't it?

[instrumental music playing]

48:16.763 --> 48:19.070
[doorbell ringing]

48:24.379 --> 48:26.338
- Stacey?
- Hey, Coach.

48:26.512 --> 48:27.817
Can I talk to you for a second.

48:27.992 --> 48:29.254
Uh, this couldn't
wait for the office?

48:29.428 --> 48:31.299
I'm sorry. I...

48:31.473 --> 48:33.606
You moved your desk, and
I didn't know where you were.

48:33.780 --> 48:36.478
That's fine. It's just that
I normally don't have students

48:36.652 --> 48:38.263
over to my house.

48:38.437 --> 48:39.438
I understand.

48:39.612 --> 48:41.222
What is it?

48:41.396 --> 48:43.050
I wanted to personally come
over and tell you

48:43.224 --> 48:44.399
that I've already had
some great interviews set up,

48:44.573 --> 48:45.923
and they're with
some good schools.

48:46.097 --> 48:47.620
Great.
That's...that's great, Stacey.

48:47.794 --> 48:49.361
They'd be lucky to have you.

48:49.535 --> 48:51.145
Thanks, Coach.

48:51.319 --> 48:52.842
I wanted to talk to you
about something else too.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.410
I haven't had that much
experience with guys.

48:55.584 --> 48:57.108
Oh, Stacey.

48:57.282 --> 48:59.327
Hey look, you're
talking to the wrong woman.

48:59.501 --> 49:03.418
I only mentioned it to
you because of Edward. He...

49:03.592 --> 49:06.073
Edward?
The British guy?

49:06.247 --> 49:09.511
Yeah, Stacey, look.
Uh, I'm gonna say
this one time.

49:09.685 --> 49:11.557
Stay away from him.

49:11.731 --> 49:15.865
You got too much of a future.
He's no good for you, okay?

49:16.040 --> 49:19.608
Focus on med school
and let him focus on golf.

49:19.782 --> 49:21.045
I just thought he was cute.

49:21.219 --> 49:22.698
I wasn't talking
about marrying him.

49:22.872 --> 49:24.613
Stacey!
You're the one that's gonna

49:24.787 --> 49:26.702
end up hurt
if you let this go on.

49:26.876 --> 49:29.009
Good seeing you, okay?

49:37.496 --> 49:39.150
Let's do this.

49:42.631 --> 49:44.111
How you doing?

49:44.285 --> 49:45.983
Hey.

49:47.462 --> 49:50.988
[music playing]

49:58.473 --> 50:00.388
There was this guy,
Ronald Simpson,

50:00.562 --> 50:03.478
a golfer and he had
this trick he'd pull, right?

50:03.652 --> 50:06.568
Now, as his opponent was
coming up to the back swing,

50:06.742 --> 50:08.179
he'd do something.
He'd move.

50:08.353 --> 50:10.616
He'd cough.
He'd say something, right?

50:10.790 --> 50:13.575
The opponent would turn around,
and he'd apologize profusely.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.534
I'm sorry, sorry.
I didn't mean it.

50:15.708 --> 50:17.449
- I won't do it again.
- Right.

50:17.623 --> 50:19.190
And then guess what he'd do?

50:20.669 --> 50:23.629
Go on. What?

50:24.934 --> 50:26.588
Cam, mate,
what's wrong with ya?

50:26.762 --> 50:28.242
What'd he do?

50:28.416 --> 50:32.681
Simpson's statue.
Just what I did then, mate.

50:32.855 --> 50:34.509
He wouldn't move a muscle,

50:34.683 --> 50:36.163
and it was completely
unnerving for his opponents.

50:36.337 --> 50:37.904
They couldn't get
back into the rhythm.

50:38.078 --> 50:39.514
Champagne golf, they called it.

50:39.688 --> 50:41.908
Cam, I love you to death, mate.

50:42.082 --> 50:44.302
I really do,
but we need to talk about
something other than golf

50:44.476 --> 50:45.738
for five minutes.

50:45.912 --> 50:48.741
Oh, yeah of course.
Absolutely.

50:48.915 --> 50:53.572
[music playing]

51:01.014 --> 51:02.450
Hey.

51:02.624 --> 51:04.278
Who is that?

51:04.452 --> 51:07.803
Oh, uh, that's just Bassam,
from the golf team.

51:07.977 --> 51:09.631
Oh, are you in the frat, too?

51:09.805 --> 51:11.720
Too?
What do you mean, too?

51:11.894 --> 51:15.420
No, I was just telling her
how I'm in the fraternity here.

51:15.594 --> 51:17.204
What are you talking about?

51:17.378 --> 51:19.032
Um, okay, if you're
gonna lie to me...

51:19.206 --> 51:21.861
No, no, no. Listen, listen,
I... He's boring, okay?

51:22.035 --> 51:23.993
He doesn't even know
what a fraternity is,

51:24.168 --> 51:26.300
and...and who could blame him?

51:27.823 --> 51:29.782
Stacey? What's up, girl?

51:29.956 --> 51:30.739
I thought you were
gonna stand me up.

51:30.913 --> 51:32.219
What's going on?

51:32.393 --> 51:35.048
- Hey.
- What's up? What's wrong?

51:35.222 --> 51:37.137
I had a talk
with my coach today.

51:37.311 --> 51:39.270
Right.
What's she got to say?

51:39.444 --> 51:41.968
I don't think
this is gonna work.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.448
Stacey,
what are you talking about?

51:43.622 --> 51:44.884
Why are you
even speaking to Coach?

51:45.058 --> 51:46.451
What does she have
to say about it?

51:46.625 --> 51:48.061
She spends more time
with you. She knows you.

51:48.235 --> 51:50.237
She doesn't know me!
She put you off me!

51:50.411 --> 51:51.847
Did she say,
"Stay away from him?"

51:52.021 --> 51:55.416
No, I mean, I don't think
it's gonna work out.

51:56.765 --> 51:58.506
Frankie, does this guy
even live in the house?

51:58.680 --> 52:02.336
Girl, I've never seen this
guy a day in my life!

52:02.510 --> 52:04.425
- All right, get out!
- I'm going. I'm going.

52:04.599 --> 52:06.340
Sorry.

52:06.514 --> 52:07.863
Hey, don't push me, okay?

52:09.561 --> 52:10.779
What's goin' on?

52:15.610 --> 52:18.396
I just don't get why she
has to stick her nose in.

52:18.570 --> 52:20.920
All right, you know,
like teach us golf, fine.

52:21.094 --> 52:22.487
Stacey, won't even
speak to me now, mate.

52:22.661 --> 52:25.142
Go get in her face.
Feels good to fight.

52:26.665 --> 52:28.319
Shut up, man!

52:28.493 --> 52:29.842
I'm sick of you talking like
you're from the hood.

52:30.016 --> 52:32.236
Yo, chill brother.
It's cool.

52:32.410 --> 52:34.499
No. It...it's not chill.
All right, it's not cool.

52:34.673 --> 52:36.457
It's all good, Young G.

52:36.631 --> 52:39.243
Craig's just mad at you
'cause you're blacker than him.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.288
Man, no I'm mad because
he acts black

52:41.462 --> 52:43.421
without knowing what it means
to be black.

52:43.595 --> 52:44.857
All right, the struggle.

52:45.031 --> 52:46.032
Oh, you don't know
the struggle.

52:46.206 --> 52:47.816
What did you just say, bro?

52:47.990 --> 52:49.731
Try to be an Algerian
in France. That's struggle.

52:49.905 --> 52:51.472
People dumber, weaker or lazier
than me get ahead because

52:51.646 --> 52:53.082
they're born to right families,
and I wasn't.

52:53.257 --> 52:55.215
Hey, hey.
Let it go, man.

52:55.389 --> 52:56.521
Just let it go.

52:56.695 --> 52:58.349
Hang on a second!

52:58.523 --> 53:00.873
You cannot be serious
right now! Really?

53:01.047 --> 53:03.310
We might be in huge trouble

53:03.484 --> 53:06.313
because you thought it would be
fun to hit someone!

53:06.487 --> 53:08.837
We could all be kicked off
the team!

53:10.665 --> 53:12.667
Golf is all I have, mate.

53:12.841 --> 53:14.495
It is it.

53:14.669 --> 53:16.323
It is my life.

53:17.716 --> 53:20.458
I don't have too much
to go home to.

53:20.632 --> 53:21.981
And you know what, mate?

53:22.155 --> 53:24.940
By the sounds of it,
neither do you.

53:28.030 --> 53:29.815
Cam, hey you all right, mate?

53:30.685 --> 53:31.730
Walk home!

53:31.904 --> 53:33.340
Come on. Get up.

53:34.298 --> 53:36.038
Get up.

53:40.086 --> 53:42.131
[knocking on door]

53:42.306 --> 53:43.742
Sit down.

53:43.916 --> 53:45.657
- Ken, I really need to--
- Please.

53:45.831 --> 53:47.441
Sit down.

53:50.662 --> 53:53.578
What's this about your
boys at a fraternity?

53:53.752 --> 53:54.927
I don't know.

53:55.101 --> 53:56.494
Don't give me that.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.365
All I know
is there was a fight,

53:58.539 --> 54:00.149
and one of my guys
was involved.

54:00.324 --> 54:01.803
- Is he off the team?
- No!

54:01.977 --> 54:03.588
I don't know anything yet.

54:03.762 --> 54:04.980
Well, I thought you were
a disciplinarian, Starks.

54:05.154 --> 54:07.113
I am a disciplinarian!

54:07.287 --> 54:08.984
But Ken, I can't just
kick him off the team

54:09.158 --> 54:10.812
without having the facts!

54:10.986 --> 54:13.250
Look, I really need to go

54:13.424 --> 54:15.121
'cause that one kid's
got some serious issues.

54:15.295 --> 54:17.341
I need to talk to him, okay?

54:17.515 --> 54:18.646
I'm replacing you.

54:18.820 --> 54:20.431
What?

54:20.605 --> 54:23.782
I'm replacing you
at the end of the year.

54:23.956 --> 54:25.784
I haven't decided whether
or not to let you come back

54:25.958 --> 54:27.481
and coach the swim team,

54:27.655 --> 54:28.743
but you definitely
will not be coaching golf.

54:28.917 --> 54:31.050
Ken, please.

54:31.224 --> 54:33.531
Look,
this team means so much to me.

54:33.705 --> 54:36.534
You're not even
giving me a chance here.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.144
Why?

54:38.318 --> 54:39.624
- The fight for one.
- But--

54:39.798 --> 54:41.713
Poor leadership.

54:41.887 --> 54:45.499
Your recruiting choices,
the way you talk to me,

54:45.673 --> 54:47.806
and your smug attitude
and the way you walk.

54:47.980 --> 54:49.851
My smug attitude?

54:51.592 --> 54:55.161
You're here because of your
daddy, except you're cheap.

54:55.335 --> 54:58.599
We didn't have the money, and
I suggest you be more careful

54:58.773 --> 55:00.035
about how you speak to me.

55:00.209 --> 55:02.168
I won't,
and we did have the money,

55:02.342 --> 55:04.344
but you just wouldn't
give it to me.

55:04.518 --> 55:06.259
But you know what?
None of that matters

55:06.433 --> 55:08.305
'cause you
never liked me since day one.

55:08.479 --> 55:10.785
Because you're smug
and you're arrogant.

55:10.959 --> 55:13.701
I am confident because
I worked my off

55:13.875 --> 55:16.443
to get everything I have
only to work with someone

55:16.617 --> 55:18.663
who's had everything given
to him on a silver platter!

55:18.837 --> 55:20.404
You're done, Starks.

55:21.796 --> 55:24.886
After your last tournament,
you're gone.

55:25.060 --> 55:26.540
I'll do you one better.

55:26.714 --> 55:28.107
I'll pack my stuff up
and be out tonight.

55:28.281 --> 55:30.675
I can't work with you,
not like this.

55:30.849 --> 55:32.372
But I will finish out the year

55:32.546 --> 55:35.506
because I'm dedicated to those
boys and my team!

55:43.122 --> 55:45.820
You ain't leavin' are you?

55:45.994 --> 55:47.518
I can't stay here.

55:48.997 --> 55:50.564
What happened?

55:52.087 --> 55:54.655
Paulsen's firing me, Roger.

55:54.829 --> 55:56.048
He can't do that.

55:56.222 --> 55:57.658
He cannot do that
without a cause.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.486
You...you gonna fight that,
aren't you?

55:59.660 --> 56:02.315
It's not like he
doesn't have grounds.

56:02.489 --> 56:07.929
I screwed up,
so that might be it.

56:08.103 --> 56:10.497
That's my life...gone.

56:12.107 --> 56:13.413
Oh no, Catana.

56:13.587 --> 56:16.329
You just go home
and get you some rest,

56:16.503 --> 56:18.462
and everything
will sort itself out.

56:18.636 --> 56:20.377
You know that.

56:30.125 --> 56:31.344
Edward,
what are you doing here?

56:31.518 --> 56:33.738
Who
do you think you are?

56:33.912 --> 56:36.305
Telling Stacey who she
can and can't be with!

56:36.480 --> 56:38.046
Because I'm white, isn't it!

56:38.220 --> 56:39.700
You're a bloody racist,
you know?!

56:39.874 --> 56:41.528
Edward, I...I really
can't do this with you.

56:41.702 --> 56:42.747
Can't do what?

56:42.921 --> 56:44.139
Argue with you,

56:44.313 --> 56:46.011
but it has nothing
to do with race.

56:46.185 --> 56:48.796
Why did you tell Stacey that
there's no future with me?

56:48.970 --> 56:51.451
She's too scared to go out
there and enjoy her life

56:51.625 --> 56:53.279
'cause of you!

56:53.453 --> 56:56.064
And your work, work, work
and join the rat race!

56:59.111 --> 57:00.982
Look, I was just...

57:01.156 --> 57:02.201
What have you got
to show for it?

57:02.375 --> 57:04.986
After all your hard work, eh?

57:05.160 --> 57:06.771
You ain't never been married!

57:06.945 --> 57:08.337
You ain't got no kids!

57:08.512 --> 57:10.992
Have you even ever had
a boyfriend?

57:12.820 --> 57:15.432
[laughing]

57:15.606 --> 57:17.956
Oh, this...this is how
you choose to live?

57:18.130 --> 57:20.175
If this is your idea of
making something of yourself,

57:20.349 --> 57:23.309
forget it, all right?
I'm out! I quit!

57:30.011 --> 57:32.666
[crying]

57:37.279 --> 57:40.674
[alarm clock ringing]

57:43.024 --> 57:46.637
[music playing]

59:25.866 --> 59:27.215
Hey.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.697
Hey.

59:32.264 --> 59:34.222
Mind if I sit?

59:41.142 --> 59:44.319
You know, I looked up what
your name means in Arabic.

59:47.018 --> 59:51.544
Bassam, you're supposed
to be a person who smiles.

59:57.506 --> 01:00:00.597
Oh, is that a smile?
Huh?

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:04.557
Why can't we have that
more often?

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:10.955
If you understand the Algerian
thing, you know why.

01:00:11.129 --> 01:00:14.349
Your War of Independence
was 200 years ago.

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:16.656
Ours was less than 50 years.

01:00:18.484 --> 01:00:21.052
My mother was made an orphan.

01:00:21.226 --> 01:00:23.097
It's hard to forget.

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:25.143
I can imagine...

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:29.974
...but I still don't understand
how you go from being

01:00:30.148 --> 01:00:35.109
so angry one minute
to being so calm the next.

01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:36.807
In golf?

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:40.027
No, just like now,
laying here in the grass.

01:00:40.201 --> 01:00:44.336
I look at you, and I think,
"Where does he go?"

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:47.208
Where do you go, Bassam?

01:00:47.382 --> 01:00:48.993
When I was a child...

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:53.171
...my mother said I could be
anything I wanted.

01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:56.957
I didn't know it wasn't true.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:01:00.569
It was always something in
the way, some people or rules

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:05.574
or laws saying,
"No, not allowed."

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.751
And instead of looking at
the world and seeing pain,

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:10.405
I look at the sky.

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:15.106
The sky goes on forever,
nothing can hold it.

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.327
In golf, when you aim your
shot, what do you see?

01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:26.247
I get it.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:31.600
When I was growing up, golf
was something that happened...

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:36.170
...behind huge walls,
tall hedges, you know,

01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:40.566
private places we weren't
accepted or allowed.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.525
Funny thing is I think
we all knew those walls
would come down

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.705
sooner or later,
then we'd be left to deal
with our own walls.

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:58.323
Mind if I borrow
the sky sometimes?

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:01.500
Not at all.

01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:07.288
Is Edward around?

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.726
No.
I haven't seen him.

01:02:11.684 --> 01:02:13.338
But I think he's angry at you.

01:02:14.687 --> 01:02:17.559
Yeah, we got some business
to take care of.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:18.865
C'est la vie,huh?

01:02:19.039 --> 01:02:19.953
Yeah.

01:02:22.216 --> 01:02:24.392
- She's my coach.
- Yeah, mine too, all right?

01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:26.873
It doesn't make any
difference to me.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:28.657
Edward! Stacey!

01:02:28.832 --> 01:02:30.572
Look, whatever you're about
to say, let's forget it!

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:32.923
We're well within our rights
to sit here and be together!

01:02:33.097 --> 01:02:34.707
- I'm not being bullied by you!
- Edward.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:36.187
Look,
just because you're my coach,

01:02:36.361 --> 01:02:37.536
doesn't mean you can just swan
in here--

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.887
Edward!
I'm trying to apologize.

01:02:42.323 --> 01:02:43.455
What?

01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:45.500
Look, for better or worse,

01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:48.329
Stacey and I have history,
okay?

01:02:48.503 --> 01:02:51.419
I coached her from the time
she started at TSU

01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.117
through last year.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.466
What? So that gives you
the right to tell her

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.467
who she can be with?

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.251
She asked me my opinion.

01:02:57.425 --> 01:02:59.297
And what, and you said,
"Stay away from Edward.

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:00.777
He's a scumbag."

01:03:00.951 --> 01:03:04.476
Edward, it is not about you.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.173
Then what's it about?

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:08.393
Me.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.223
It's about me.

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:15.574
When I went to college,
I was there to work,

01:03:15.748 --> 01:03:18.882
study and get my degree.
That was it.

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:21.101
I wasn't there to party,
socialize.

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:22.929
Of course.

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:31.372
But, then I met him.

01:03:31.546 --> 01:03:34.941
He was gorgeous,
and he had a car.

01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:37.422
[laughing]

01:03:37.596 --> 01:03:43.558
Yeah, he'd come pick me up and
we'd go out to eat and dance

01:03:43.732 --> 01:03:46.953
and golf.
Yeah, golf was our game.

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:49.477
So what happened?

01:03:49.651 --> 01:03:51.479
Well, he was good.

01:03:51.653 --> 01:03:54.134
He was real good.

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:57.355
So the guys from the
pro tour started calling.

01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:59.531
I was excited for him.

01:03:59.705 --> 01:04:03.448
I was just wondering
what I'd do with myself
when he was gone.

01:04:06.016 --> 01:04:10.498
So, about a week
before he was set to leave,

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:12.544
he took me out to play 18.

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:15.199
I could barely
get through nine.

01:04:15.373 --> 01:04:18.550
I was too worked up
to even focus on a ball

01:04:18.724 --> 01:04:21.335
much less swing a club.

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:27.428
So, we finally get to hole 18,
and he has me pull the flag

01:04:27.602 --> 01:04:29.300
because he needed to putt.

01:04:29.474 --> 01:04:31.780
Wouldn't you know it?
A ring popped out.

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:34.914
He was so corny.
[laughing]

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.403
I said, "What about school?

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:47.840
I got to finish school."

01:04:48.014 --> 01:04:51.496
He said,
"Don't worry about school.

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.194
I'm gonna be a professional
golf player making millions.

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.457
You won't have to work."

01:04:59.765 --> 01:05:01.898
I looked in his eyes...

01:05:05.336 --> 01:05:09.470
...and I said I can't.
I'm sorry.

01:05:09.644 --> 01:05:12.473
Why?
You...you were in love.

01:05:12.647 --> 01:05:14.345
That doesn't make
any sense at all.

01:05:14.519 --> 01:05:16.738
Yeah, just the way I
was raised, you know?

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:21.134
Values I had.
My parents.

01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:25.486
Not being able to stand on your
own two feet wasn't an option.

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:30.013
So I had to let him go.

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:34.104
I just didn't want Stacey
to have to go through

01:05:34.278 --> 01:05:38.673
what I went through.
But that's not how it works.

01:05:41.328 --> 01:05:43.809
And I should've
learned that by now.

01:05:50.642 --> 01:05:51.904
She seems more soft, right?

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:54.385
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly, mate.

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.691
I saw her before she saw you,
and she didn't try to push,

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:58.867
try to be tough.
She was really sweet.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:02.436
Yeah, it was a whole other side
to her we hadn't seen before.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.918
It turns out that golf is the
thing that reminds her

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:08.877
of the one time in her life
that she was truly happy.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:10.444
That's heavy.
[phone ringing]

01:06:10.618 --> 01:06:12.098
Yeah, it was, mate,
knocked me for six.

01:06:12.272 --> 01:06:14.274
- I got it.
- I went from wanting to

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:16.624
bite her head off to wanting
to give her a cuddle

01:06:16.798 --> 01:06:18.104
and saying
it's gonna be all right.

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:21.803
Yeah, Coach. Sure thing.
That was Starks.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.762
She said that practice is off,

01:06:23.936 --> 01:06:25.546
but she wants to have
a team meeting

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:27.766
at her house on Thursday night.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.333
- Dinner...
- At her house?

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:31.552
That's what she said.

01:06:31.726 --> 01:06:33.119
[doorbell ringing]

01:06:34.729 --> 01:06:35.904
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.603
- Hi.
- Come in.

01:06:43.521 --> 01:06:44.739
Wow, Coach.

01:06:44.913 --> 01:06:46.350
Make yourself at home.

01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:47.481
You scrub up all right, Coach.

01:06:47.655 --> 01:06:48.961
Thank you.

01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:51.311
- You look so good.
- Thank you.

01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:55.185
So, um,
I hope you don't mind pasta

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:57.404
'cause I'm not really
much of a cook.

01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:59.406
That's good.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:00.625
That'll be fine.

01:07:00.799 --> 01:07:02.235
I like marinara.

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:05.238
CATANA:
So, is everybody full?

01:07:05.412 --> 01:07:06.587
Yeah.

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.328
Thank you so much.

01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:10.461
You don't have to lie
if it was nasty.

01:07:10.635 --> 01:07:11.940
[laughing]

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:13.507
No, no.
It was really good.

01:07:13.681 --> 01:07:15.335
Brilliant.

01:07:15.509 --> 01:07:17.294
Thank you.

01:07:17.468 --> 01:07:18.817
Hey, guys.

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:21.254
After our conversation, Bassam,

01:07:21.428 --> 01:07:23.517
you got me to thinking about
a lot of things.

01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:26.172
What do you mean?

01:07:26.346 --> 01:07:30.176
Well, you know, about golf,
life, those big walls.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:35.529
Anyway, I've had a lot of time
to think about things lately;

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:37.575
ever since I lost my job.

01:07:37.749 --> 01:07:39.403
You...you what?

01:07:39.577 --> 01:07:40.795
You what?

01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:42.623
Wait, you never told me that.

01:07:44.495 --> 01:07:45.757
Because of the fight?

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:48.281
No...no, let me clarify.

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:52.024
Um, I'm still the coach
for now, but next year...

01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:54.548
Hang on.
You can't be serious.

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:56.550
You can't leave.

01:07:56.724 --> 01:08:01.729
Cameron, if it were up to me,
I wouldn't be.

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:03.775
Believe me.

01:08:03.949 --> 01:08:07.083
I take this job very seriously.

01:08:07.257 --> 01:08:09.389
It's my life.

01:08:09.563 --> 01:08:12.784
I'm so embarrassed to say this,
but up until now,

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:15.569
my job is all I've had.

01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:19.704
There's this idea in this
country that if you aren't

01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:24.970
working or pushing 24/7, well
then you're wasting your time.

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.233
And I don't believe
that anymore.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:30.758
I don't think life should just
be about work, work, work.

01:08:30.932 --> 01:08:35.415
But we can still work there.
I mean, we can still play golf?

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:37.983
Yes, Cameron, yes.

01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.900
But I think it should be fun.

01:08:42.074 --> 01:08:43.858
Yeah, just to clarify.

01:08:44.032 --> 01:08:46.252
Um, we're gonna...we're
gonna play out the year, right?

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:47.906
Oh, Cameron, yes.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.342
We're gonna play out
the rest of the year,

01:08:49.516 --> 01:08:50.822
and this is how we're
gonna do it.

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:54.130
Okay, first we're up early.

01:08:55.435 --> 01:08:57.611
Get all the practice we can...

01:08:57.785 --> 01:09:00.353
Why is that foot back?

01:09:00.527 --> 01:09:02.747
...but focus on
your schoolwork too.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:08.100
You can be great students or
at least pretty good students.

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.581
I want you to meet new people,

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:13.932
and I want you to care for
one another like brothers,

01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:16.282
like a real team.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:18.458
And maybe squeeze in
one more practice

01:09:18.632 --> 01:09:20.765
before bed just because.

01:09:20.939 --> 01:09:23.289
If you ever felt like other
players were more prepared

01:09:23.463 --> 01:09:27.075
than you, throw that excuse
right out the window.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:31.254
And if we can
just keep playing
our game doing our thing,

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.952
you'll give me some good
memories to go out on.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.957
What is the point of this?

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:40.872
I said we were
playing from the rough.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:44.528
You didn't think I was talking
about tall grass, did you?

01:09:44.702 --> 01:09:46.094
What are we doing?

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:49.794
[instrumental music playing]

01:09:57.628 --> 01:09:59.978
Oh!

01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:09.640
And finally,
our men's golf team
has placed in the top three

01:10:09.814 --> 01:10:12.251
in its last two tournaments
and can finish strong

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:14.210
at the
National Minority Championship.

01:10:14.384 --> 01:10:16.212
They got the invitation,
and it's this weekend.

01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:18.214
All right.

01:10:19.606 --> 01:10:21.391
Good.

01:10:21.565 --> 01:10:24.959
That means Starks gets a big
fat raise, doesn't she?

01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:27.919
Roger, don't you ever go home?

01:10:28.093 --> 01:10:30.226
Oh, no,
way too hot in the house.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.836
But you guys don't mind me.

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:33.751
I'll be out you
guys' hair in a second.

01:10:33.925 --> 01:10:35.970
Got to get the trash.

01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:51.899
As for, uh, Starks,
unfortunately,

01:10:52.073 --> 01:10:54.685
I've decided not to retain her
for the coming year.

01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:56.904
- What?
- Why?

01:10:57.078 --> 01:10:59.472
There are many reasons.

01:10:59.646 --> 01:11:01.518
First, despite the cost,

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:02.997
she recruited almost all of her
players out of the country,

01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:04.825
and she kept making
budget demands.

01:11:04.999 --> 01:11:06.697
There were
disciplinary issues...

01:11:06.871 --> 01:11:08.394
...and she didn't work well
with the administration.

01:11:08.568 --> 01:11:11.789
- You, in other words.
- Yes, me.

01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:14.444
I'm the one in charge.

01:11:14.618 --> 01:11:17.969
Paulsen, when I said
our program was a mess,

01:11:18.143 --> 01:11:20.450
I wasn't talking about Starks.

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:24.280
Now, she's our one bright spot,
has been for years.

01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:27.544
Where do you get the nerves
to make a move like that?

01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:29.415
It's complicated.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:31.765
Complicated?
Are you kidding me?
Fire Starks?

01:11:31.939 --> 01:11:36.292
Young man, what in God's
name were you thinking?

01:11:40.818 --> 01:11:42.036
Hey, how'd your meeting go?

01:11:43.255 --> 01:11:44.865
Oh, it's like that?

01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:47.041
Everybody thinks I'm some
rich guy who got this job

01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:48.782
because I had connections!
I didn't!

01:11:48.956 --> 01:11:51.568
I had a career before this!
I've run businesses!

01:11:51.742 --> 01:11:53.483
I managed hundreds
of employees!

01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:55.223
But here, no one will
give me credit for anything!

01:11:55.398 --> 01:11:58.009
It's not about credit, Ken,
it's about respect.

01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:00.185
Respect?
Don't tell me about respect!

01:12:00.359 --> 01:12:03.580
All my life
I've done everything
everybody wanted me to do!

01:12:03.754 --> 01:12:06.191
You try walking a mile
in my shoes!

01:12:07.627 --> 01:12:09.760
I might not have
walked in your shoes,

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:13.546
but I know what you stepped in
'cause it's my job to clean it.

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.332
So if anybody should be
complaining, it's me.

01:12:16.506 --> 01:12:19.596
But if you noticed, I'm not.

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:21.946
Yeah, and I don't
understand that, Roger.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.731
I mean, your stats were better
than mine and here you are.

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:27.038
You could do anything you
wanted to on the field.

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:29.432
The field?
Listen to yourself, Ken!

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.912
We spend most of our time
in this country

01:12:32.086 --> 01:12:33.523
on somebody's field.

01:12:33.697 --> 01:12:36.352
First cotton and tobacco,
now sports.

01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:39.137
At some point, the respect
we seek has to come from us,

01:12:39.311 --> 01:12:41.531
not our performance
on somebody's field.

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:44.838
Nobody gets to tell me
what I'm worth but me.

01:12:45.012 --> 01:12:46.884
Well, it's easy for you, Roger.

01:12:47.058 --> 01:12:50.801
'Cause everybody here likes
you, and they love Starks.

01:12:50.975 --> 01:12:52.498
Of course they do!
Let's look at what she's done.

01:12:52.672 --> 01:12:54.544
She's coaching a
sport nobody wanted,

01:12:54.718 --> 01:12:56.981
players nobody wanted.
Come on, man.

01:12:57.155 --> 01:12:59.157
If you're so wrapped up in your
own thing you can't see it,

01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:00.941
I don't know what to tell you.

01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:03.335
But if you really want respect,

01:13:03.509 --> 01:13:06.164
how about you give some
where it's due?

01:13:18.045 --> 01:13:19.569
[horn honking]

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.745
Come on, fellas!
We want to get there early!

01:13:21.919 --> 01:13:22.702
All right.
Good day, Coach!

01:13:22.876 --> 01:13:23.964
Hey.

01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:26.880
[laughing]

01:13:27.054 --> 01:13:27.925
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:13:28.099 --> 01:13:29.796
- Morning.
- Hello.

01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:31.232
Hey.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.366
Uh, what happened to Young G?

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.890
I'm Ji-Kyung this weekend.
My dad's coming.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.718
You look so handsome.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.894
Oh yeah.

01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:46.291
[music playing]

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:10.620
Cam, is it me mate
or are we the...

01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:12.665
...only white people
at the golf tournament?

01:14:12.839 --> 01:14:14.972
Yeah, mate, apparently.
First time for everything, huh?

01:14:15.146 --> 01:14:17.322
Okay, listen up.

01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:19.063
Black and white striped shirts.

01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:22.022
That's who we're paired with,
Brantley State.

01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:25.199
You see the guy with the
dreads? Well he turned me down.

01:14:25.373 --> 01:14:28.464
He laughed at me.
So did the one beside him

01:14:28.638 --> 01:14:30.988
and that other one
wouldn't even shake my hand.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.383
I want to beat them so bad.
You hear me?

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:37.385
Yeah.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.562
Oh, Shawn Howard
at the top of the steps.

01:14:39.736 --> 01:14:41.999
The one I told you about,
the next Tiger Woods.

01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:44.610
He looks better.

01:14:44.784 --> 01:14:46.351
And we can beat him.
Stop staring.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:49.006
Let's go.
Get your clubs.

01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:54.228
[instrumental music playing]

01:14:58.363 --> 01:15:00.408
You looking for your dad?

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.932
Yeah.

01:15:02.106 --> 01:15:03.586
He'll show up.

01:15:04.369 --> 01:15:06.502
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.994 --> 01:15:23.127
Oh man.

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:54.114
What'd you do to your hair?

01:15:54.288 --> 01:15:56.116
I did this for you.

01:15:57.291 --> 01:15:58.597
I dyed mine black.

01:15:58.771 --> 01:16:01.557
It's a paint.
I'm down for you.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:05.909
- I got to get back to my team.
- Go get 'em.

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:07.258
I'll see you at the next hole.

01:16:07.432 --> 01:16:12.350
[instrumental music playing]

01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:09.799
I bet you 50, he misses.

01:17:21.158 --> 01:17:23.595
Oh.

01:17:23.769 --> 01:17:25.989
At the end of game one,
Shawn Howard has led

01:17:26.163 --> 01:17:27.991
the heavily favored
Brantley State University

01:17:28.165 --> 01:17:30.428
to the top
of the leader board.

01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:39.742
You know,
I can't say that I would've
done anything like this

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:41.787
in the past.

01:17:41.961 --> 01:17:45.748
Probably would've gone
somewhere cheap to talk
strategy.

01:17:45.922 --> 01:17:49.839
But I figured,
a nice meal couldn't hurt.

01:17:50.013 --> 01:17:52.406
- Thanks, Coach.
- You're welcome.

01:17:59.370 --> 01:18:02.939
They only take the top four
scores out of the five

01:18:03.113 --> 01:18:06.159
so, you don't all
have to be perfect,

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:09.772
but I would like to remember
you all playing

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.122
to your full potential
like I said we would.

01:18:12.296 --> 01:18:13.558
Yes, ma'am.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:15.081
- Definitely.
- Yes, Coach.

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:16.692
Okay.

01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:19.695
What do I do?

01:18:19.869 --> 01:18:22.262
I...I sucked again.
I don't know.

01:18:22.436 --> 01:18:24.395
Craig, let's try
to figure this out.

01:18:24.569 --> 01:18:27.964
You talk
yourself out of things.
You're in your own way.

01:18:28.138 --> 01:18:29.835
Talk it through.

01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:31.924
Try this. It's good.

01:18:32.098 --> 01:18:33.578
Oh yeah? What is it?

01:18:33.752 --> 01:18:36.015
I don't know. I'm French.
I'm not Italian.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:39.279
Oh. So now he's French.
Did you hear that everyone?

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:42.718
Eat your food, Edward.

01:18:44.676 --> 01:18:49.725
[indiscreet chatter]

01:18:54.773 --> 01:18:57.341
[choking]

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.475
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:19:01.649 --> 01:19:03.086
He was eating my food,
and then...

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.436
What was he eating?
What were you eating?

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.873
Call 911 somebody! Now!

01:19:15.489 --> 01:19:17.665
- How you feeling, mate?
- Hey, mate.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.145
Ironic all of this, isn't it?

01:19:19.319 --> 01:19:20.843
What's that?

01:19:21.017 --> 01:19:22.932
Australia's nothing
but shellfish.

01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:26.283
What's the, uh...what's it
called, the Great Barrier Reef?

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:28.415
I don't snorkel, mate.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.549
Hey, guys.

01:19:31.723 --> 01:19:33.594
Oh, hey Coach.
So, uh, I'm all good.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.466
I can play tomorrow?

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.424
I'm afraid not, Cameron.

01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:40.906
Oh, no, no, Coach. I'm good.
I'll be able to play.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.516
I'm sorry.

01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:55.878
CATANA: Now, we really have
to bring our best

01:19:56.052 --> 01:19:58.358
since they just can't take
the top scores.

01:19:58.532 --> 01:20:00.578
Every one counts, okay?

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:06.932
- Ooh, look at those shoes.
- You like those?

01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:08.847
Please don't tell
me you stole those?

01:20:09.021 --> 01:20:10.631
Of course not.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.025
My mom sent then to me,
all right? She's proud.

01:20:13.199 --> 01:20:14.418
It's the first big
tournament and everything.

01:20:14.592 --> 01:20:16.246
Oh, wait, your mom?

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.117
I thought you were,
uh, from the streets?

01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:19.597
[laughing]

01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:22.513
We've all got a mom, eh mate?

01:20:22.687 --> 01:20:24.471
That was a good one.

01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:33.176
You Craig?

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.786
Uh, yes.

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.919
I'm Shawn.
You with me today.

01:20:39.747 --> 01:20:42.185
Is that how you shake hands?

01:20:42.359 --> 01:20:44.796
I really hope you grip
your club better than that.

01:20:56.503 --> 01:20:58.766
You good?

01:20:58.941 --> 01:21:01.552
Shawn Howard
just shook my hand.

01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:03.859
I'm facing him?

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:12.476
Get out there and you face him.

01:21:15.305 --> 01:21:16.959
Yeah.

01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:18.438
SHAWN:
So who'd she recruit first?

01:21:18.612 --> 01:21:20.571
I don't...I don't know.

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:21.746
I...uh...I tried out,
made the team

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:24.227
and then she found the rest.

01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:26.403
So there were no good golfers
at your college

01:21:26.577 --> 01:21:28.405
so she went international?

01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:31.843
I see why.

01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:51.558
You know,
I just realized something.

01:21:51.732 --> 01:21:52.995
I looked at your team's
information.

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:55.649
It said you from
just outside of Atlanta.

01:21:57.782 --> 01:21:59.784
You're Craig, right?

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:03.092
Uh, yeah.

01:22:04.658 --> 01:22:09.011
One of my teammates
said he had a great caddy...

01:22:09.185 --> 01:22:10.316
...said the kid
always wanted to be

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:11.448
the first person
from his family

01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:14.103
to go to college.

01:22:14.277 --> 01:22:19.543
So when Tennessee State
accepted him, he was excited.

01:22:22.807 --> 01:22:25.288
It's you, isn't it?

01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:26.898
The caddy?

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:31.163
Yeah, man, yeah.

01:22:31.337 --> 01:22:33.383
Well, at the end of the day,
I hope I can get another
handshake

01:22:33.557 --> 01:22:36.299
from you 'cause I would hate
to have to go to the back

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:38.431
and tell everybody else
that Craig, the caddy,

01:22:38.605 --> 01:22:40.172
has a weak grip.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.742
I'm...I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

01:22:44.916 --> 01:22:46.439
I can't straighten out my game,
and he just keeps talking it.

01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:48.615
Who? Shawn Howard?

01:22:48.789 --> 01:22:50.487
- Yeah, he won't shut up!
- Craig!

01:22:50.661 --> 01:22:52.576
Shawn's been playing golf
since he was three years old.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.057
His family has poured more
money into him playing golf

01:22:55.231 --> 01:22:58.060
than we've all
seen in our entire lives!

01:22:58.234 --> 01:23:00.932
He needs to talk himself up.
He's scared of you.

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:03.195
- He's not.
- Yeah, he is.

01:23:03.369 --> 01:23:05.545
Craig, look at me!
This is the big time.

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.025
I never had the chance before,

01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:08.853
but now I do
because of this team,

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.724
and you're part of this team.
A big part!

01:23:10.898 --> 01:23:12.291
- Yes!
- Come on!

01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.119
Craig, Mate.
Start believing in yourself.

01:23:14.293 --> 01:23:16.121
As soon as you realize that,
the sooner you'll realize

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:18.645
you have got everything inside
you it takes to beat this guy.

01:23:18.819 --> 01:23:21.344
I know it.
We all know it.

01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:23.172
You got this, brother.

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:28.568
You got this.

01:23:29.221 --> 01:23:30.440
Yes.

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:32.659
[laughing]

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:34.226
- Come on.
- He's right, man.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.662
- You got this.
- Come on. You can do it.

01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:38.230
Ready to win this?

01:23:38.578 --> 01:23:40.319
Absolutely.

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:42.234
Let's go.

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:53.550
[music playing]

01:24:17.617 --> 01:24:19.619
What?

01:24:43.817 --> 01:24:46.385
What is that?

01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:49.475
Uh, I don't know.
Just the ones we got.

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:52.652
Look like they got that
out of a shed somewhere.

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:55.090
Right, well they, uh, they did.

01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:09.321
[cheering]

01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:30.342
You're not gonna let us lose
to my caddy, are you?

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.791
Did you close your eyes?

01:27:11.965 --> 01:27:13.315
Just like you taught me.

01:27:13.489 --> 01:27:14.794
Like I taught you to do
in practice.

01:27:14.968 --> 01:27:17.536
Not in a game.
Are you crazy?

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:19.321
Hey, what's the score?

01:27:19.495 --> 01:27:21.497
He gets this, we tie.
We go to a playoff.

01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:23.238
Shh!

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.896
[coughing]

01:27:30.984 --> 01:27:31.898
I'm trying to shoot over here.

01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:33.944
I'm sorry, mate.

01:27:34.118 --> 01:27:35.728
I'm really sorry.
[clears throat]

01:27:35.902 --> 01:27:37.252
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry. [clears throat]

01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:06.193
How about you do me a favor
and stop doing that?

01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:08.979
- Me?
- Yeah, you! Stop doing that!

01:28:09.153 --> 01:28:10.372
I'm not doing anything, mate.

01:28:10.546 --> 01:28:11.851
- Exactly!
- Hold on now, mate.

01:28:12.025 --> 01:28:13.418
- Hey, hey!
- Calm down.

01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:15.420
- Relax!

01:29:12.259 --> 01:29:14.044
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:29:14.218 --> 01:29:17.961
the National Collegiate
Minority Championship winners,

01:29:18.135 --> 01:29:22.269
Catana Starks
and the Tennessee State
men's golf team!

01:29:22.444 --> 01:29:25.185
[cheering]

01:29:34.673 --> 01:29:36.153
What are you doing?

01:29:36.327 --> 01:29:37.546
Just give me a minute.
I need to say something.

01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:43.465
My name is
Kendrick Paulsen, Jr.

01:29:43.639 --> 01:29:47.947
I'm the athletic director
at Tennessee State University,

01:29:48.121 --> 01:29:51.124
and this trophy is something
that we will treasure at TSU

01:29:51.298 --> 01:29:53.300
for a very long time.

01:29:53.475 --> 01:29:59.916
Coach Starks here, has done
some truly amazing things

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:01.918
with this team,

01:30:02.092 --> 01:30:05.138
and I'm honored for having
had the opportunity

01:30:05.312 --> 01:30:06.923
to work with her.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.926
Go Coach!

01:30:14.147 --> 01:30:16.280
My father wanted me
to go to TSU

01:30:16.454 --> 01:30:20.980
because he wanted me to learn
the things that he learned,

01:30:21.154 --> 01:30:23.200
and to be around people
who know what it means

01:30:23.374 --> 01:30:25.594
to roll up their sleeves,

01:30:25.768 --> 01:30:29.815
to work hard
and to never quit.

01:30:29.989 --> 01:30:33.166
I couldn't have asked for
a better example...

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.604
...than Catana Starks.

01:30:40.086 --> 01:30:41.044
Congratulations, Coach.

01:30:41.218 --> 01:30:43.655
Thank you.

01:30:43.829 --> 01:30:45.265
Thank you.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:47.877
- Here.
- No.

01:30:48.051 --> 01:30:49.444
You've earned it.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.495
Hey, congratulations to you.

01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:59.628
