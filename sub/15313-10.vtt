00:33.861 --> 00:35.988
Fire!

00:36.063 --> 00:37.325
You!

00:39.100 --> 00:40.362
We told you to go!

00:40.434 --> 00:42.766
Quickly! Help! Help!

00:44.037 --> 00:47.632
Heretic! Heretic!

01:06.393 --> 01:08.952
Kill the heretic! Kill him!

01:10.997 --> 01:12.760
Put him in!

01:23.142 --> 01:24.837
- It's the devil!
- Stop!

01:24.910 --> 01:26.968
He's come to save his own!

01:27.045 --> 01:28.876
The devil couldn't make it.

01:28.946 --> 01:31.346
You'll have to deal with me instead!

01:31.416 --> 01:34.317
This is no business of yours, Robin.
The stranger' s been killing our livestock.

01:34.385 --> 01:38.286
- Fouling our well!
- What kind of man burns churches?

01:38.356 --> 01:40.118
I'll let you know...

01:40.191 --> 01:41.589
when I've asked him.

01:41.658 --> 01:43.523
He fights like a Crusader.

01:43.593 --> 01:44.993
Soldier! Break!

01:45.062 --> 01:46.553
Battle!

01:46.631 --> 01:48.029
Oh, no...

01:54.171 --> 01:56.536
Bring him back! Heretic!

02:39.981 --> 02:44.576
So. Master, forgive me,
but you found him trying to burn a church

02:44.651 --> 02:46.619
yet you saved him and not the church.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.019
Because I could not fit the church on my horse!

02:51.825 --> 02:53.349
What are they?

02:55.895 --> 02:58.194
These look like Eastern symbols. Djaq?

02:59.565 --> 03:01.500
Do these mean anything to you?

03:05.605 --> 03:07.630
Ah! I don't know.

03:09.342 --> 03:10.707
It could be some sort of code.

03:17.383 --> 03:18.941
It's strange.

03:19.018 --> 03:21.485
He fought like a Crusader back in Locksley.

03:21.553 --> 03:23.646
Yeah, on the wrong side by the looks of him.

03:23.722 --> 03:26.782
No. He definitely went out with King Richard.

03:30.328 --> 03:31.886
He's beyond sides now.

03:33.364 --> 03:34.956
War has turned his mind.

03:35.099 --> 03:36.726
Crusader' s sickness.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.931
And there 'll be thousands more like him
while the war drags on. He needs care.

03:42.006 --> 03:45.305
Much, you need to look after him.

03:45.377 --> 03:47.901
Oh, no. Master.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.378
Master, please.

03:50.447 --> 03:52.745
I mean, look at him. Surely...

03:52.816 --> 03:54.545
Well, you looked after me all these years.

03:54.618 --> 03:57.382
Yeah, but... he's a menace!

03:57.454 --> 04:03.187
Yes! You know, I think that's the first time
we've actually agreed on something.

04:03.259 --> 04:06.422
He's been burning down churches
and fouling wells!

04:22.945 --> 04:24.378
Fine.

04:24.446 --> 04:26.505
I'll look after him.

04:26.582 --> 04:29.106
Just answer me one question.

04:29.183 --> 04:32.641
How are you meant to look after
a deranged heretic?

04:44.999 --> 04:49.561
Meat. The secret
to controlling wild birds.

04:50.771 --> 04:53.603
Not jealous of a horse, are we?

04:53.673 --> 04:56.301
Marian and I have had
a disagreement, that is all.

04:56.376 --> 04:59.505
- I had hoped...
- Hope. I would rather be dead

04:59.579 --> 05:02.605
than spend my life hoping.
"I hope for this. I hope for that."

05:02.682 --> 05:04.513
Buy her something.

05:04.584 --> 05:06.745
A trinket or two.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.845
Marian is not the type to be bought.

05:08.955 --> 05:12.117
Nonsense. All women can be bought.
It's a nesting thing.

05:12.192 --> 05:14.455
They want to make sure their
offspring are provided for.

05:14.526 --> 05:15.823
They're animals, really.

05:18.030 --> 05:21.727
Sir, your Saracen guest has asked
if you're gonna be dining with him.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.665
Already? What have you prepared for him?

05:23.736 --> 05:24.703
Brain of goat.

05:25.737 --> 05:27.899
Mm... Marvelous!

05:27.973 --> 05:29.371
Here, give him this.

05:30.441 --> 05:32.909
I can't believe the Saracens
like that kind of filth.

05:32.977 --> 05:34.911
No, I don't believe so either.

05:34.979 --> 05:39.382
But I think our Saracen friend...
Well, he thinks we're being polite.

05:40.551 --> 05:44.008
We've got to keep him happy, Gisborne,
if we're to get what we want.

05:44.087 --> 05:47.023
Amazing! You've got to see this wagon, boys,
it's completely unique!

05:47.091 --> 05:49.615
I've never seen a set of wheels like it!

05:49.694 --> 05:52.663
Independent suspension,
reinforced chassis...

05:52.729 --> 05:55.095
- It's a fine machine, Robin!
- What is it?

05:55.166 --> 05:58.100
- Rich owner, too.
- Cos this is not English wood.

05:58.168 --> 05:59.726
This is spectacular!

05:59.803 --> 06:03.102
Eastern cedar. My dad got a block of it once
to make dagger handles.

06:03.172 --> 06:06.506
- It's very easy to rout.
- Slides right down...

06:06.576 --> 06:11.103
This must've got caught up in the storm two
weeks ago. This gully must have been a torrent.

06:11.180 --> 06:14.274
- Hey, it looks like some kind of list.
- Is that directions?

06:17.787 --> 06:20.119
It's the castle, I think.

06:20.189 --> 06:23.522
Looks like the Sheriff's got himself a rich visitor.

06:27.196 --> 06:29.027
What's up, John?

06:29.131 --> 06:31.963
There! There!

06:32.033 --> 06:34.695
Eh? Steady up, John...
What's got into you?

06:39.873 --> 06:41.273
It's no joke, Robin!

06:41.343 --> 06:44.334
- It's witchcraft!
- Hardly!

06:46.648 --> 06:49.673
It's a fine piece of work...

06:49.750 --> 06:52.241
for a nasty mind. Robin.

06:52.319 --> 06:55.311
The Sheriff's certainly keeping
some strange company.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.188
Robin! Let it be!

07:00.260 --> 07:02.387
John, it's only a mask.

07:08.067 --> 07:10.399
Oh, come on!

07:13.940 --> 07:15.305
Get a grip!

07:19.978 --> 07:22.606
Really. I do not like surprises.

07:23.749 --> 07:26.513
Well, you'll like this one.

07:29.654 --> 07:31.918
Oh, he's beautiful.

07:35.527 --> 07:38.087
- But I cannot possibly accept him.
- Why not?

07:38.163 --> 07:40.631
- The expense.
- What expense?

07:40.699 --> 07:44.100
- My fortune is secure, I can provide for you.
- Really?

07:44.169 --> 07:46.329
That's what I've been trying to show you.

07:47.371 --> 07:49.499
Humor me.

07:49.573 --> 07:51.564
Just put him through his paces.

07:52.343 --> 07:53.674
OK.

08:08.491 --> 08:10.550
Right! We're going to try some cooking!

08:11.361 --> 08:13.295
Very calming. Understand?

08:15.031 --> 08:16.396
I'll take that as a yes.

08:18.600 --> 08:23.765
Now, we have pork, carrots, onions, parsnips.

08:23.839 --> 08:29.072
Now, most servants would tell you
that this is a stew. But...

08:29.144 --> 08:31.874
Well, this I call the Much Touch.

08:31.947 --> 08:33.607
Take the same ingredients,

08:33.682 --> 08:36.207
chop them up...

08:36.318 --> 08:40.118
skewer them on a broken arrow...

08:40.188 --> 08:41.621
cook it over a fire...

08:41.690 --> 08:44.420
You're left with something far more...

08:44.492 --> 08:46.551
interesting!

08:46.627 --> 08:49.027
Learnt that in Cyprus.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.792
- There, they call it...
- Sish kebabi.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.399
Then you'll know how delicious they are.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.208
Are you sure it's a good idea
to give him the knife?

09:05.111 --> 09:09.172
He does have a name. He's called, er...

09:10.550 --> 09:12.814
He's called Harold.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.020
Maybe this is your true calling.
Your new life.

09:17.089 --> 09:20.082
I've often thought a man could
make a good living doing this.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.289
Get himself a cart and wheel it
up to the alehouse of an evening,

09:24.363 --> 09:29.096
set out his wares -
some of these, a bit of stew, meat pies...

09:29.168 --> 09:30.465
Make a killing!

09:30.536 --> 09:32.163
- Rubbish! It is!
- And another thing...

09:32.238 --> 09:35.365
...my cousin definitely saw a man
turn into a frog!

09:35.441 --> 09:39.069
- He did! Just outside Dorchester!
- You said he was always drunk.

09:39.144 --> 09:41.112
Well, he is. But still...

09:41.179 --> 09:42.807
Another mouth for dinner.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.906
- Waaargh!
- Not you as well!?

09:44.983 --> 09:47.110
- What is that?
- Put it this way.

09:48.185 --> 09:50.949
I would not like to be on
the receiving end of this.

09:51.022 --> 09:55.481
- Looks like it's for torture.
- Whatever it is, that is not Christian!

09:55.560 --> 09:59.962
Don't do that! You might cause plagues
of locusts. Rivers of blood!

10:00.030 --> 10:01.588
What?!

10:01.698 --> 10:05.464
Our friends are convinced
a master of the dark arts is at the castle.

10:05.536 --> 10:08.505
Someone from the east to scare us,
a bogeyman under the bed...

10:08.572 --> 10:10.267
Come on! Look!

10:10.340 --> 10:12.331
It's working already.

10:13.043 --> 10:17.035
Something this grotesque
cannot be for good.

10:19.782 --> 10:22.546
- Saracen evil!
- Nothing to do with me!

10:22.618 --> 10:24.381
- Harold!
- Torturer!

10:24.453 --> 10:28.445
Calm down. She's one of us.
Now, listen to me...

10:28.524 --> 10:30.651
Drop the knife.

10:33.162 --> 10:35.926
- What did you do that for?
- To save Djaq!

10:35.998 --> 10:39.160
He trusted me!
He was gonna drop the knife!

10:40.403 --> 10:42.063
You see?

10:42.137 --> 10:45.504
That's how it works. Fear.

11:00.154 --> 11:02.247
This all looks most... delicious.

11:03.524 --> 11:09.257
In truth, food this exotic in my country
is eaten...

11:09.329 --> 11:11.696
- only occasionally.
- Really!

11:11.765 --> 11:13.698
Well, it's no trouble.

11:14.335 --> 11:16.564
Anything to make you feel more at home.

11:17.537 --> 11:19.164
- Bismallah.
- Indeed.

11:19.939 --> 11:21.930
Bismallah.

11:28.247 --> 11:32.114
- So, when do we start work?
- Oh, I share your impatience,

11:32.184 --> 11:33.550
but we can't start without Prince John.

11:33.620 --> 11:35.917
But it has been two weeks already.

11:35.988 --> 11:39.947
We must act by the next full moon.
Otherwise there is no time.

11:40.025 --> 11:42.926
Please, just a little more patience.

11:42.995 --> 11:47.455
I mean, if there is anything we can do
to make your stay more bearable...

11:47.532 --> 11:49.966
Maybe more eye of toad and so on?

11:50.836 --> 11:52.565
No.

11:52.638 --> 11:55.868
I would like to press on.

11:55.940 --> 11:59.205
Perhaps if Prince John cannot come here,

11:59.276 --> 12:02.540
I could recover my wagon and go to London.

12:02.613 --> 12:04.012
That may be easier.

12:04.081 --> 12:07.880
You are confined for your own protection.

12:07.951 --> 12:10.921
You yourself urged the need for secrecy
in this business.

12:10.988 --> 12:13.182
Then let us start this business.

12:13.256 --> 12:15.656
Prince John or no Prince John.

12:15.725 --> 12:19.058
We have a saying in this country -
all work and no play...

12:19.129 --> 12:20.756
that's what the poor do!

12:29.139 --> 12:32.006
Come on, John! We're off
to drag the wagon out of the mud.

12:32.107 --> 12:33.870
No!

12:34.543 --> 12:37.341
We need something strong to keep Harold in
when he has his turns.

12:38.313 --> 12:40.679
- The wagon's perfect.
- I stay here.

12:41.583 --> 12:42.982
Protected.

12:44.687 --> 12:46.085
You're not serious?

12:47.088 --> 12:49.921
The biggest man in Sherwood,
jumping at shadows?

12:50.491 --> 12:51.982
Not shadows.

12:52.094 --> 12:54.323
The devil!

13:04.705 --> 13:06.071
Will?

13:08.942 --> 13:12.343
Go in to Nottingham,
find out who's really at the castle.

13:12.946 --> 13:15.107
We have got to help Little John.

13:20.921 --> 13:24.447
Don't tell me the Nightwatchman
has been dipping into the profits!

13:24.523 --> 13:27.321
Some men take pleasure
in giving women gifts.

13:27.393 --> 13:30.089
This is a lot of gift.

13:30.162 --> 13:32.995
And tell me, was it a lot of pleasure?

13:34.166 --> 13:36.361
And how are you thinking of reciprocating?

13:36.435 --> 13:38.869
Maybe you'd find out if you gave me a gift.

13:38.938 --> 13:43.931
As it is, you only come out of the woodwork
to ask me for favors. Like now.

13:44.008 --> 13:45.407
So?

13:45.477 --> 13:49.914
Do we have an interesting guest at the castle?
The owner of this was on his way there.

13:49.981 --> 13:53.542
- We think he's from the East.
- You've been eating too many mushrooms.

13:53.618 --> 13:55.643
My men think the Sheriff
has been using a sorcerer.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.584
Well, they've been eating too many mushrooms.

13:57.688 --> 14:01.887
Agreed! But if you could tell us who it is,
I can reassure my men.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.792
- John will not even leave the forest.
- Hmm...

14:04.862 --> 14:08.856
Another one who only comes out
of the woodwork when he has to.

14:10.701 --> 14:13.067
I'll see what I can do.

14:16.540 --> 14:17.939
Hey.

14:18.008 --> 14:21.842
Don't worry, it's for your own protection.

14:21.912 --> 14:23.276
Well, ours really.

14:23.346 --> 14:27.147
- What did I do this time?
- Well, let's just say you ruined the kebabs.

14:27.216 --> 14:28.878
You don't have to lie to me.

14:29.886 --> 14:32.684
You tried to kill Djaq because she is a Saracen,

14:32.755 --> 14:35.120
which, if I may say, is odd

14:35.190 --> 14:38.591
considering five minutes ago you were going
to burn down a Christian church.

14:38.660 --> 14:40.651
I mean, come on, make your mind up.

14:40.730 --> 14:42.321
The Saracen, beware the Saracen!

14:42.397 --> 14:43.660
Harold...

14:43.733 --> 14:45.893
The Saracen destroys everything in your mind.

14:45.967 --> 14:47.059
Listen to me.

14:48.303 --> 14:52.637
Now, apart from being a girl,
Djaq is one of the lads.

14:52.707 --> 14:54.197
All right?

14:59.314 --> 15:02.750
Do you know when it's going to happen?
These turns?

15:04.318 --> 15:06.309
Anything can start it.

15:07.922 --> 15:11.085
I'm watching a child fishing in a stream...

15:12.326 --> 15:15.659
and suddenly I'm looking in the water.

15:15.729 --> 15:17.252
The water is full of bodies.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.459
Drowned, left to rot...

15:21.534 --> 15:23.399
So you know.

15:24.304 --> 15:25.703
Where were you?

15:26.506 --> 15:28.030
Nicea...

15:28.107 --> 15:30.098
Tripoli...

15:31.277 --> 15:32.641
Pelagonia...

15:33.478 --> 15:34.878
We were at Acre.

15:36.783 --> 15:38.181
You must get the dreams?

15:42.121 --> 15:44.111
Of course.

15:44.189 --> 15:45.622
It's our punishment.

15:51.896 --> 15:54.058
All this fuss over a painted mask.

15:55.499 --> 15:57.091
Come on, you're not an animal.

15:57.168 --> 15:59.659
No. It's better this way.

15:59.737 --> 16:01.398
Better for whom?

16:14.118 --> 16:16.848
...one goes in, one goes out.
If anyone asks, I wanna know.

16:18.488 --> 16:21.356
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, Marian.

16:21.425 --> 16:22.823
How thoughtful.

16:22.893 --> 16:25.453
Actually, I heard there was a guest
staying in the castle.

16:25.528 --> 16:28.019
I thought he might enjoy some local fruit.

16:28.098 --> 16:29.690
Oh, no.

16:29.766 --> 16:32.029
He doesn't like this kind of food.

16:32.101 --> 16:35.502
- He sounds intriguing.
- I'm afraid you really can't be here, Marian.

16:35.571 --> 16:37.039
Orders.

16:37.107 --> 16:41.042
Orders, orders.
May I remind you, Guy, we are engaged.

16:41.110 --> 16:45.979
You subjecting me to orders, however
impressive your gifts, is rather inappropriate.

17:15.809 --> 17:18.300
Listen to this!

17:18.377 --> 17:24.146
He hasn't got a bad voice! I haven't heard
this sort of thing since that last battle...

17:24.217 --> 17:26.742
Didn't you inform our Saracen guest
that I was sleeping?

17:26.819 --> 17:30.916
- He wouldn't take no for an answer, sir.
- Please... let them come soon, please!

17:35.895 --> 17:39.797
- You're a morning person, I see!
- Sheriff, I've had an excellent idea.

17:39.865 --> 17:41.025
Really.

17:41.100 --> 17:44.035
If you would lend me some soldiers,
I can go find my carriage.

17:44.103 --> 17:48.233
What, that old wreck? I already said.
I'll get you a new one.

17:48.307 --> 17:51.639
Unless Prince John is arriving today, Sheriff,

17:51.710 --> 17:54.338
it would make me most happy
to find my carriage.

17:54.412 --> 17:57.745
It was specially made for my father.

17:58.717 --> 18:02.652
Well, in that case, how could I refuse?

18:02.720 --> 18:05.087
You are a most gracious host.

18:05.156 --> 18:07.146
Bismallah!

18:10.728 --> 18:12.662
- Wake Gisborne.
- At this hour, sir?

18:12.730 --> 18:14.722
If I can't sleep, neither can he.

18:18.335 --> 18:20.462
Tell him to keep the Saracen happy.

18:21.505 --> 18:24.496
At least give him the illusion of freedom.

18:26.877 --> 18:29.174
I hope you're not leading me
on a wild goose chase, Malik!

18:29.279 --> 18:31.576
I am sure it was around here.

18:31.681 --> 18:34.445
Though it all looks quite similar. Very green.

18:35.318 --> 18:36.683
Stranger on the move!

18:36.753 --> 18:39.779
- Out of the castle!
- What kind of stranger?

18:41.524 --> 18:43.321
- Saracen.
- That's our friend!

18:43.393 --> 18:45.088
We could be attacked by spirits at any moment.

18:45.161 --> 18:47.686
He rode out at dawn
with Gisborne and his troops.

18:47.764 --> 18:51.529
- Which way was he heading?
- This way, into the forest.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.967
We've got to smash that thing up.
It could draw him towards us.

18:55.037 --> 18:57.528
Nothing is going to draw anybody anywhere!

18:57.606 --> 19:01.041
Now, let's go and see who he is, shall we?

19:01.108 --> 19:04.078
Come on, John, come and face your fear.

19:05.814 --> 19:07.907
It's all right, John.

19:09.417 --> 19:12.944
We are taking on the Forces of Darkness
and we'll be all right?

19:13.020 --> 19:14.453
Yes!

19:14.522 --> 19:16.786
It's a Saracen man!

19:16.857 --> 19:20.190
Now, listen to me, this is what
we're going to do.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.838
There she is!
Come, let us see how badly she is damaged.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.476
That wagon's not going anywhere.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.046
She's still in one piece.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.784
That's good Saracen craftsmanship.

19:58.397 --> 20:01.833
Now. We can do this my way,
or you can turn me into a frog.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.458
- What?!
- My way, then.

20:26.056 --> 20:27.319
No!

20:37.099 --> 20:39.261
You're sure it won't cause him any pain?

20:39.336 --> 20:42.737
What choice do we have?
He's much too dangerous.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.137
We need to control him.

20:48.711 --> 20:53.341
- There must be another way.
- Look, we tried your way, he nearly killed me.

21:04.192 --> 21:06.023
She says it tastes of strawberries.

21:06.094 --> 21:08.028
If you want to kill me, use a sword.

21:08.897 --> 21:11.593
No, this is not a poison.
This is to help you sleep.

21:11.666 --> 21:16.500
- You trust her? Saracen?
- Yes.

21:17.505 --> 21:19.496
And you should trust me.

21:27.314 --> 21:30.283
Mmm... It does taste of strawberries!

21:32.486 --> 21:35.284
I like strawberries. They taste of home.

22:04.716 --> 22:06.411
So, tell me, John.

22:07.852 --> 22:10.878
What is so powerful about him?

22:18.362 --> 22:20.455
At least one of you knows how to show respect.

22:20.532 --> 22:23.296
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

22:23.367 --> 22:27.929
This man is Prince Malik al-Ayyubi-n-Shadi!

22:28.973 --> 22:31.406
Nephew of Saladin!

22:31.508 --> 22:33.442
I served under him.

22:33.510 --> 22:35.307
The Saladin?

22:35.945 --> 22:38.039
- Oops.
- He is royalty!

22:38.115 --> 22:39.376
Bow down to him!

22:40.383 --> 22:42.613
Nobody bows down to anybody!

22:42.685 --> 22:45.552
Not in this forest. John?

22:46.589 --> 22:48.056
- Come and say hello to...
- No!

22:48.124 --> 22:50.058
You, I do not like.

22:50.126 --> 22:52.856
My friends would like to know about this mask.

22:52.929 --> 22:54.658
What have you done to it?

22:54.730 --> 22:56.857
I cannot present it now!

22:56.932 --> 22:59.298
- That's a gift?
- It was.

23:00.135 --> 23:02.296
- A peace offering.
- Peace?

23:02.371 --> 23:05.101
Let's stick needles in his head,
see how he likes it.

23:05.907 --> 23:08.535
And this is what happens when cousins marry.

23:09.111 --> 23:11.578
This is a model, for teaching.

23:11.646 --> 23:16.083
Needles placed correctly on parts of the body
can cure all sorts of ailments.

23:17.518 --> 23:22.046
- Sounds like dodgy magic to me.
- This is science, not magic.

23:22.123 --> 23:24.353
What, so you're a physician then?

23:24.424 --> 23:27.451
You see, John? A physician.

23:27.528 --> 23:32.464
- That's all.
- I'm not a physician. I am an ambassador.

23:32.532 --> 23:36.161
This gift for Prince John
is a gift of healing,

23:37.103 --> 23:39.435
to celebrate our new peace treaty.

23:39.506 --> 23:42.942
- Prince John wants peace?
- I want peace.

23:43.009 --> 23:46.001
The Holy Lands are drenched in blood.

23:46.079 --> 23:49.310
Thousands of men die on both sides.

23:50.216 --> 23:53.378
This is not the will of Allah.

23:53.485 --> 23:59.185
It is the duty of all good men
to put an end to this barbarity.

23:59.291 --> 24:04.228
So, I come to negotiate with Prince John
and the Sheriff.

24:04.296 --> 24:07.060
If you really want peace in the Holy Land,

24:07.131 --> 24:11.033
Prince John and the Sheriff
are the last people you should be speaking to.

24:11.103 --> 24:13.332
Whatever they've told you is a lie.

24:13.404 --> 24:15.872
And how can I believe what you say?

24:15.940 --> 24:21.378
You and your band of
superstitious, ignorant outlaws.

24:21.446 --> 24:24.847
Now, I demand you let me go.

24:24.916 --> 24:27.281
I'm not being funny, mate,
we've just caught you!

24:27.351 --> 24:29.251
Let me go.

24:29.319 --> 24:33.278
Or let the blood of thousands
be on your conscience.

24:36.259 --> 24:39.023
- You ordered me to take him into the forest!
- You were supposed to bring him back!

24:39.096 --> 24:42.463
- All right, I will find him somehow.
- A ransom requires a hostage!

24:42.532 --> 24:44.624
What am I supposed to give them, you?

24:44.700 --> 24:47.362
How much do I get for lovestruck
idiots these days?

24:47.470 --> 24:50.303
Well, the Saracens don't seem to be hurrying
to rescue their prince, do they?

24:50.373 --> 24:52.739
They will come!

24:52.808 --> 24:54.174
Open the door!

24:55.912 --> 25:01.280
Well... and who was it who said the sun
only shines on the righteous?

25:01.349 --> 25:02.715
He has returned.

25:02.785 --> 25:06.050
The Saracens must really believe
we're going to speak peace.

25:06.122 --> 25:08.682
Oh, such a brave man.

25:08.758 --> 25:12.625
And yet, such a stupid man.

25:14.095 --> 25:16.256
Stupid man.

25:21.703 --> 25:23.830
Oh, nice legs!

25:23.904 --> 25:25.895
I meant the horse.

25:28.709 --> 25:30.769
There 's definitely something going on.

25:30.878 --> 25:33.676
Somebody is staying in the castle
but nobody is allowed near him.

25:33.747 --> 25:36.443
It's a good job Gisborne's got
the gifts covered, then.

25:36.517 --> 25:38.849
You don't deserve anything from me!

25:38.919 --> 25:41.012
Guy is being unusually extravagant.

25:41.088 --> 25:43.420
- It must be a business deal.
- It's not business.

25:43.490 --> 25:45.650
It's a Saracen Prince come to negotiate peace.

25:45.725 --> 25:48.523
- With the Sheriff?
- And he's expecting Prince John.

25:48.594 --> 25:51.620
Well, no one's preparing for a summit.

25:51.698 --> 25:53.528
You do surprise me, Marian!

25:53.599 --> 25:57.034
So, how is Gisborne making money
out of a Saracen ambassador?

25:57.102 --> 25:59.867
- It doesn't make sense.
- Unless it's...

26:00.539 --> 26:02.098
It's a ransom.

26:02.175 --> 26:04.039
What, he's being held hostage?

26:04.109 --> 26:05.543
But he thinks he's a guest.

26:05.611 --> 26:07.168
More fool him.

26:08.114 --> 26:11.742
I'll bet there 's a fat ransom on its way
even as we speak.

26:11.850 --> 26:17.219
Enjoy the horse while you can.
I've got a feeling it might be repossessed.

26:21.159 --> 26:23.217
There we go.

26:23.294 --> 26:25.695
Just pop your head on there.

26:33.304 --> 26:36.068
Time for another dose.

26:39.943 --> 26:41.935
No more.

26:43.279 --> 26:49.411
Oh, surely you're feeling better. I mean,
that's the first time you've slept peacefully.

26:49.486 --> 26:51.852
It's not sleep.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.286
It's living death.

26:55.191 --> 26:58.490
If I am to be destroyed...

26:58.561 --> 27:00.529
let it be a soldier' s death.

27:00.597 --> 27:02.621
Not an invalid's.

27:10.706 --> 27:13.072
It doesn't have to be either.

27:14.877 --> 27:19.541
Your mind, it can heal... in time.

27:19.648 --> 27:21.581
I saw the horrors...

27:21.649 --> 27:25.017
and sometimes I wake up
in the middle of the night.

27:27.088 --> 27:29.454
- But I'm still...
- You just saw them...

27:31.492 --> 27:33.083
I did them.

27:33.994 --> 27:35.360
See these...

27:50.076 --> 27:52.236
They captured me,

27:52.312 --> 27:55.304
tormented me,

27:55.382 --> 27:57.542
tortured me, until I killed my own.

27:58.284 --> 27:59.912
Killed innocents.

27:59.985 --> 28:03.045
Killing was the only thing that
would numb the pain.

28:03.889 --> 28:05.356
I'm a monster.

28:05.424 --> 28:07.449
I'm going to hell.

28:09.128 --> 28:10.993
Who is "they"?

28:13.532 --> 28:15.591
Who did this to you?

28:16.335 --> 28:19.065
Pray you'll never meet them.

28:36.954 --> 28:38.319
Allan.

28:40.123 --> 28:42.250
That doesn't look like a ransom!

28:42.326 --> 28:44.294
- It is not a ransom.
- Course it's a ransom.

28:44.361 --> 28:47.921
Flags of safe passage,
women to show good faith...

28:55.505 --> 28:57.699
Robin, this is not right.

28:57.773 --> 29:01.265
Muslims are forbidden to worship
human images.

29:01.344 --> 29:02.710
I'm not surprised.

29:02.778 --> 29:04.143
It's hardly a masterpiece, is it?

29:04.814 --> 29:08.044
I think it might be the Al-Shuj'aan.

29:08.116 --> 29:10.584
Saladin's assassination squad.

29:11.786 --> 29:14.084
Only one of them is armed.

29:15.524 --> 29:18.549
And that chest of money
could feed a lot of mouths.

29:18.627 --> 29:20.527
- Let's take it.
- Robin, no!

29:30.938 --> 29:33.634
That's not worship. That's target practice.

29:34.341 --> 29:38.744
You are not listening
to me because I'm a woman.

29:38.812 --> 29:42.077
- Don't make the same mistake with them.
- I'm all ears.

29:42.149 --> 29:46.950
Enough excuses! We must start
the peace negotiations tonight.

29:47.021 --> 29:50.684
Every day that passes
more innocent lives are lost.

29:50.757 --> 29:52.816
Ya-di-ya-di-ya.

29:52.892 --> 29:57.295
I warn you, Sheriff,
I have heard aspersions cast on your honesty.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.361
Aspersions? Surely not.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.727
Now, I insist.

30:02.802 --> 30:08.035
We start the talks today or I travel to London
and find Prince John myself!

30:09.676 --> 30:11.040
You see Gisborne,

30:11.109 --> 30:14.636
this is what you have to look
forward to, already.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.442
He's starting to sound like a wife.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.881
How dare you insult me!

30:20.452 --> 30:21.419
Two words...

30:21.486 --> 30:24.148
Peace? Off.
Throw him in the dungeon.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.553
Sheriff!

30:25.656 --> 30:28.649
Sheriff come back! Sheriff! Sheriff!

30:29.326 --> 30:34.628
The Prince thinks he's here to negotiate peace
and the Sheriff thinks a ransom is on its way.

30:34.699 --> 30:40.262
But neither of them know that Saladin
has sent assassins instead. So...

30:40.337 --> 30:42.635
So, we stay here and do nothing.

30:42.707 --> 30:45.937
Let those Al-Shuj'aanis kill the Sheriff
and rescue the Prince.

30:46.010 --> 30:50.036
- Sounds good to me.
- No! The Al-Shuj'aan do not rescue.

30:51.114 --> 30:53.639
They're killers. That's what they do.

30:53.717 --> 30:56.151
Kill, or die in the attempt.

30:56.252 --> 30:58.686
If they're not going to rescue the Prince,
why are they here?

30:58.754 --> 31:00.120
They're here to kill the Prince.

31:01.091 --> 31:02.854
Why would Saladin want to kill his own nephew?

31:02.926 --> 31:06.293
A nephew that wants peace at any cost.
Saladin wants a fair deal.

31:06.362 --> 31:10.422
- So why send him here in the first place?
- But that's the thing. He didn't.

31:10.499 --> 31:12.763
He came on his own.

31:16.004 --> 31:19.440
- We have to rescue the Prince.
- We tried that. He doesn't want to know!

31:19.508 --> 31:22.568
War in the Holy Land is 2,000 miles away.
It's not our problem.

31:22.678 --> 31:27.138
No, Allan, you're wrong!
War is here! It's right here in the forest.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.846
He was an ordinary Englishman.

31:29.918 --> 31:33.216
He tilled the fields, he loved his wife,
he cared for his children.

31:33.287 --> 31:35.380
- He's not married!
- It's an example.

31:35.456 --> 31:39.721
Then he was forced to go to the Holy Land
to fight. Look at him!

31:40.694 --> 31:44.926
A pitiful shadow of a man.
Every day good men like Harold

31:44.998 --> 31:46.693
are destroyed out there!

31:46.767 --> 31:49.327
Only peace can put a stop to this.

31:50.504 --> 31:52.563
Who are you calling pitiful?

31:53.707 --> 31:55.072
You ran from women.

31:58.077 --> 31:59.443
You know about them?

31:59.513 --> 32:03.916
I know which part of hell
the Al-Shuj'aan come from...

32:03.984 --> 32:05.348
in here.

32:06.285 --> 32:09.255
They're the ones who did this to you?

32:09.322 --> 32:13.257
Does anyone here know
what these two are talking about?

32:32.177 --> 32:33.940
That's what we're talking about.

32:46.691 --> 32:49.625
War is so much more profitable than peace.

32:49.693 --> 32:51.183
Especially after today.

32:51.261 --> 32:54.424
Be careful they don't cheat us.
You know what these Saracens are like.

32:54.498 --> 32:58.059
Well, if they do, we shall give back their Prince
on a pro rata basis.

32:58.902 --> 33:00.835
Chunk by chunk.

33:03.039 --> 33:04.404
Salaam aleikum.

33:04.473 --> 33:07.671
Yes, yes, yes. Salaam aleikum.

33:08.878 --> 33:12.279
My dear ransom.

33:13.349 --> 33:14.714
The, er, the key?

33:15.885 --> 33:17.284
A sample of the treasure.

33:21.890 --> 33:25.054
Oh, yes, it's very good,
but I'd rather have the key.

33:26.294 --> 33:27.852
First we must see our Prince.

33:27.929 --> 33:30.227
Yes, of course.
Gisborne, take him to the dungeons.

33:36.770 --> 33:38.204
What now?

33:38.273 --> 33:41.298
I cannot leave the women undefended.

33:43.878 --> 33:46.676
I was really rather hoping to do
without the hospitality.

33:47.848 --> 33:52.012
All right! Leave your weapons outside.

33:52.686 --> 33:54.677
Bring the Prince to my quarters.

33:58.259 --> 34:00.089
Ha! One prince.

34:05.299 --> 34:08.233
- No!
- Take him to the Great Hall.

34:12.906 --> 34:15.373
But you have not given him to me.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.409
You have not given me my money.

34:17.476 --> 34:19.444
Then you leave me no choice.

34:19.511 --> 34:21.411
Here is your key.

35:26.342 --> 35:27.707
Gisborne, help me.

35:52.065 --> 35:53.862
Guards!

35:56.136 --> 35:58.001
Wait! Please!

35:58.071 --> 35:59.539
Take him!

35:59.606 --> 36:01.005
Take the Prince!

36:04.478 --> 36:07.242
Forget about the ransom.
You can have him for free!

36:07.314 --> 36:09.578
You misunderstand, my friend.

36:09.649 --> 36:13.483
We are not here to rescue the Prince.
We come to bury him.

36:13.552 --> 36:15.713
Along with all talk of peace!

36:26.966 --> 36:28.831
- Where 's the Prince?
- Forget him!

36:28.901 --> 36:30.458
Stay here, protect me!

36:32.671 --> 36:34.069
I'll give you your Prince...

36:34.139 --> 36:37.108
- Where?
- In the hall.

36:40.045 --> 36:41.979
Will, get the horses to the east gate.

36:42.647 --> 36:43.807
We'll get Malik.

36:46.251 --> 36:48.185
Don't leave me!

36:50.121 --> 36:52.213
Guards! Guards!

37:01.497 --> 37:03.056
Get them!

37:03.133 --> 37:05.191
- Stop them!
- Forget us!

37:05.268 --> 37:07.600
- Watch the entrance!
- You heard him!

37:07.670 --> 37:10.902
- Guard the doors!
- The Sheriff's with us?

37:11.674 --> 37:14.473
Did no one ever tell you that fools
do not deserve to be rescued?

37:14.545 --> 37:16.205
This is not a rescue yet, Malik.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.271
La-di-da-di-da!
Will you two just shut up?

37:33.328 --> 37:35.296
Get behind me.

37:36.431 --> 37:37.989
D'you have any ideas?

37:38.066 --> 37:40.795
Much, Djaq, John, over there.

37:40.868 --> 37:42.769
Allan, Vaizey, with me.

37:43.437 --> 37:46.167
- Me?
- Do it, or we die.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.091
Oi!

38:14.200 --> 38:16.565
Come on, then!

38:25.210 --> 38:27.269
Ready?

38:27.346 --> 38:29.314
Now!

39:03.447 --> 39:05.914
I hate this. This isn't much fun at all!

39:40.082 --> 39:42.276
Get Malik out, now!

39:55.095 --> 39:56.461
One.

39:56.531 --> 39:58.396
Two.

40:00.168 --> 40:01.600
Keep behind me, keep behind me.

40:07.441 --> 40:08.840
Three.

40:24.824 --> 40:27.725
Get him, Prince Bismallah...

40:27.793 --> 40:30.227
far away from here.

40:31.230 --> 40:32.788
The feeling is mutual.

40:34.233 --> 40:37.691
And Locksley! Remember...

40:40.239 --> 40:43.230
Business as usual tomorrow.

40:43.308 --> 40:45.208
I'll look forward to it.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.920
And you've never done this before?

41:00.991 --> 41:03.152
I've studied the theory.

41:03.227 --> 41:04.751
Will it work?

41:04.828 --> 41:06.796
Ask him yourself.

41:06.864 --> 41:08.627
How do you feel?

41:08.699 --> 41:12.999
It doesn't feel bad.
It's been a long time since I could say that.

41:13.903 --> 41:16.303
How long will the needles have to stay in?

41:16.406 --> 41:17.806
Of that I am not certain.

41:17.874 --> 41:21.742
I will send more instruction
once I have reached Jerusalem.

41:21.811 --> 41:24.279
No need. I'll come with you.

41:24.347 --> 41:25.745
See you safe.

41:25.815 --> 41:27.543
You're going to go back there?

41:27.616 --> 41:30.415
There 'll be no true peace in here
until there 's peace out there.

41:31.019 --> 41:33.954
I'm afraid your hopes for peace
may be in vain.

41:35.390 --> 41:36.790
Not so.

41:36.859 --> 41:38.622
Think about it, my friend.

41:38.695 --> 41:43.188
Saladin sends his finest soldiers to kill me,
and yet I survive.

41:43.265 --> 41:44.823
It is the will of Allah.

41:44.899 --> 41:46.925
Allah wills peace.

41:47.002 --> 41:51.028
Saladin may be ruthless
but he is also a good Muslim,

41:51.105 --> 41:53.267
and even he must follow the will of Allah.

41:56.811 --> 41:58.803
Good luck.

42:06.220 --> 42:10.246
It's amazing what a few
well-placed needles can do.

42:11.625 --> 42:14.355
I don't think it was just the needles, Much.

42:15.428 --> 42:17.157
You understood him.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.756
You gave him hope.

42:19.833 --> 42:21.562
I didn't do anything.

42:21.634 --> 42:24.124
I just listened to him.

42:24.203 --> 42:26.536
Well, maybe that's the real magic.

42:27.607 --> 42:29.574
Listening.

42:34.813 --> 42:38.681
Why don't you listen to me more, Master?

42:38.784 --> 42:40.752
- Master!
- What?

42:40.819 --> 42:43.151
Sorry, did you say something?

42:43.222 --> 42:46.555
Unbelievable, you talk to me about listening
then you don't listen!

42:46.625 --> 42:47.989
Pardon?

42:48.060 --> 42:51.358
You talk to me about listening...

42:51.429 --> 42:54.125
Very funny! Very funny!

42:55.566 --> 42:58.501
- Seriously, you don't listen.
- I do listen to you!

42:58.569 --> 42:59.968
You don't listen to any of us...
