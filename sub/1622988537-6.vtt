WEBVTT

00:21.313 --> 00:22.898
Are you people serious right now?

00:22.981 --> 00:24.858
We're just having breakfast.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.778
Yeah, just like a family. As one does.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.657
-As we do in our home.
-Yeah, you're insane.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.116
Honey.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.706
Do you live here now?

00:39.790 --> 00:42.042
Oh, my God.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.252
Oh, my God.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.336
Do you?

00:45.963 --> 00:49.424
Actually, I'm just staying here
until my parents sort out their stuff,

00:49.508 --> 00:50.968
which they're going to do today.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.847
So I'd love to take this opportunity
to say thank you so much for--

00:54.930 --> 00:57.641
No, just stop.
Okay, you're being so weird.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.227
-For saying thank you?
-Yeah, come on, Iz.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.478
Let him finish.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.605
Sorry. I just--
Yeah, I don't know how to--

01:04.690 --> 01:06.358
I've just never, with parents--

01:06.441 --> 01:08.193
-Sorry, can I--
-Yeah.

01:09.361 --> 01:11.697
And thank you again
for loaning me the pajamas.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.657
They were very festive.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.910
Yeah, of course. No problem.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.831
Well, I'd love to stick around
and do whatever this is,

01:20.914 --> 01:23.333
but I should get going, so…

01:23.417 --> 01:24.543
Bye.

01:30.465 --> 01:34.219
Breaking news: Your boyfriend
is living in your house with you.

01:34.303 --> 01:35.554
Care to comment?

01:37.472 --> 01:38.473
Come on.

01:38.557 --> 01:39.558
Come on, Iz.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.768
-It was just a joke.
-We're sorry.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.645
I can't write about that.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.107
Dad.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.654
We need to find out what's on that island.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.978
I looked up the island and applied
the coordinates from the flight plan.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.939
I know exactly where Hank was headed.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.650
And Pop-Pop has a boat,
so we could use it to get there.

02:29.733 --> 02:30.984
It won't take that long.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.654
I thought we said no Richie Fife.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.782
Yeah, but that was before
we heard his name on the black box.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.201
Mom, you know how important this lead is.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.787
Are you having nightmares again?

02:41.870 --> 02:42.871
No.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.082
-Not that.
-Okay.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.544
This secret that Richie had,
it's not gonna stay buried.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.338
Whatever he told Sam's dad,
whatever's on that island,

02:51.421 --> 02:53.549
I think that may have been
why he got taken.

02:53.632 --> 02:56.552
You know what?
You've got no evidence to support that.

02:56.635 --> 02:58.971
Yeah, that's why we have to go find some.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.556
Dad, look.

03:00.639 --> 03:04.977
There's something there. I know there is.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.362
You know what?

03:15.445 --> 03:19.199
I promised your mom that I would stay home
and I would watch Pop-Pop and Ginny,

03:19.283 --> 03:21.869
you know,
so that she can go to the office.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.412
-That's only fair.
-Dad,

03:23.495 --> 03:25.789
do you think the reporters
at The Boston Globe said,

03:25.873 --> 03:27.875
"I'm sorry. I can't interview this priest.

03:27.958 --> 03:32.129
I can't crack the story of a generation
because I have to go walk my dog."

03:32.212 --> 03:35.465
Wait, I told you not to watch that movie.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.467
-Did you just compare me to a dog?
-No!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.845
It's just that this is really important.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.640
Is there any way you could
work from home today?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.810
Oh, no. Don't you give me
those Puss-in-Boots eyes.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.395
You're worse than Walter.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.107
Yeah, you know what?
I'm calling it. I'm on team Mom here.

03:52.191 --> 03:56.820
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but it'll have to wait.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.461
All right, fine.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
What?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.673
I will work from home
so you two can chase this lead.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.350
Thanks, Mom. You're the best mom ever.
You're number one.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.310
Did I say you looked beautiful today?

04:28.393 --> 04:29.394
-Astonishing.
-Okay.

04:29.478 --> 04:30.771
You're like a ray of sunshine!

04:49.623 --> 04:52.626
-You got our backpacks back?
-Someone dropped them off.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.254
-That's nice.
-As a message.

04:56.505 --> 05:00.092
But that's not what I came here
to talk to you guys about.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.011
I know that look. So let's skip the part
where I don't want to do it

05:03.095 --> 05:05.430
and go straight to the part
where you convince me to.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.102
How do you guys feel about boats?

05:11.186 --> 05:14.523
-I'm gonna need some Dramamine.
-Sure. Okay.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.762
You only have to be 12 to get
a boating license in Washington state.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.223
I'll be certified on my next birthday.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.735
Guys, there's something out there.
Up ahead.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.779
Something big. Stop the boat now. Stop it.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.578
What is it?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.289
-It looks like some sort of reef.
-A reef?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.751
-On a freshwater lake?
-I knew there'd be sharks.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.587
-Donny, it's not a shark.
-Nah, it can't be a reef.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.756
Hey, good work.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.258
-We could've run aground.
-Boom.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.105
Yeah, looks like
it's a few feet below the surface.

06:37.189 --> 06:41.568
It's been raining a lot lately.
There's so much more water in this lake.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.904
Please don't say
it's because of climate change.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.240
Okay, fine.
It's because of the environment,

06:46.323 --> 06:49.368
and how it's spiraling into
a catastrophic, almost biblical end.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.953
-What?
-All right,

06:51.036 --> 06:53.330
let's drop anchor at that sandy beach.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.489
So this explains it.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.703
Mom, do you want sprinkles
with your ice cream?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.746
Yes, please, I love sprinkles.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.876
Okay, okay.
I thought we were just playing pretend.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.252
Oh, man.

07:40.335 --> 07:43.338
Okay, you go over there.
I got these. Don't worry.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.382
Okay.

07:45.465 --> 07:49.720
Hello?
And you can't just drop it off here, you--

07:49.803 --> 07:51.013
No, no.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.097
Okay.

07:52.681 --> 07:55.934
So you're telling me that a courier
is bringing time-sensitive documents,

07:56.018 --> 07:59.563
on a weekend, to my office,
and you can't reroute them,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.231
and I have to sign for them myself?

08:01.315 --> 08:02.566
With my own hand.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.068
-I'll take sprinkles.
-Izzy.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.072
No. No, I can't reschedule
because I need them by Monday,

08:09.156 --> 08:13.076
and I'm home alone, taking care of
two human beings, and I'm--

08:13.160 --> 08:16.205
No, I don't have a wife
who can take care of them for me.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.539
'Cause I'm my wife.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.000
Please.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.378
Please. I need help.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.380
-No.
-Please!

08:25.464 --> 08:28.467
Mom, please, I'm about to go meet up
with Emma in, like, half an hour.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.093
Can you hold on just a second?

08:33.554 --> 08:34.681
Is that a bribe?

08:34.765 --> 08:37.308
Yeah, take it.
But then remind me to teach you

08:37.392 --> 08:40.102
about how women frequently
lowball their value at work.

08:41.980 --> 08:45.984
Okay, thank you. I will be there as soon
as I can. Just tell them not to leave.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.864
It's for the Wott case and Trip's dad.
It's important or I wouldn't go.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.991
-I know.
-Thank you.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.078
I love you, and just remember
it's not just about Ginny.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.622
Keep an eye on him too, okay?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.123
Yeah.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.229
…bear.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.189
We're glad you're home, honey.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.149
Big bear. Chase.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
-Big bear chase.
-What is he saying?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.653
-What?
-Big bear chase me!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.212
All right, listen up.

09:47.296 --> 09:50.132
Frank and I
are gonna go in a little further,

09:50.215 --> 09:53.177
and I want you guys to stay here.

09:53.844 --> 09:54.845
Wait.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.347
What?

09:57.431 --> 09:59.975
Hilde, I gotta make sure
it's not too dangerous in there.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.895
But no one even knows we're out here.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.689
Yeah, and we don't know
what's in there. All right?

10:05.772 --> 10:10.736
So, until we do,
the three of you are safer out here.

10:11.695 --> 10:14.323
Look, me and Frank
are just gonna take a quick look around,

10:14.406 --> 10:17.534
and if it's all good, if it's safe,
then yeah, we'll come back.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.412
We'll come get you guys.
Until then I want you to stay here.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.955
-Dad--
-We'll take pictures,

10:22.039 --> 10:24.374
and we'll tell you
about everything we see along the way.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.210
This is our story.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.296
Our lead.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.135
Okay, I know you're frustrated.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.347
Okay, I get it.
But look, I'm your dad, all right?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.974
I didn't know how I was gonna feel
until we got out here.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.394
And my gut is just telling me
that I gotta make sure it's safe first.

10:44.478 --> 10:49.483
And besides, I need you to be
my eyes and ears out here, all right?

10:49.566 --> 10:52.277
You see anything, you hear anything,
you gotta let me know.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.154
Yeah, look, check it out.

10:54.238 --> 10:57.950
These are long-range units,
so we can communicate the entire time.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.163
All right? Does that make sense?

11:06.208 --> 11:08.669
-Can I get a yes?
-Yes.

11:08.752 --> 11:10.754
All right. Put it there.

11:12.589 --> 11:16.510
All right, don't worry.
We will be back real soon.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.303
You guys keep an eye on each other.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.930
Tell us what you see.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.183
Don't rush back on my account.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.029
Thanks for coming over.
I'm sorry I couldn't leave.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.156
Dude, I'm so sorry.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.867
What? No, I'm so sorry.

11:39.950 --> 11:42.327
No, Iz, you were right. I was being weird.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.997
-I was avoiding you.
-Okay.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.708
And, look, I know you and Ethan
are together or whatever,

11:47.791 --> 11:50.794
and I don't wanna mess that up
or anything. I just…

11:51.628 --> 11:53.714
I thought maybe if you knew

11:55.132 --> 11:58.177
that I like you.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.307
I really like you.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.644
And until Ethan came back,
I thought that you liked me too.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.731
But now I don't know.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.903
So I guess I'm just
putting it out there to see how you feel.

12:24.203 --> 12:27.873
I should probably go check on my sister,
make sure she's not trying to, like,

12:27.956 --> 12:32.002
boil pasta or stick her finger
in an electrical socket or something.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.357
Ginny?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.109
Pop-Pop?

13:16.171 --> 13:17.923
-Crap.
-What is it?

13:18.006 --> 13:20.634
Ginny and my grandpa.
I think they're gone.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.475
I need some sunscreen and bug spray.

13:28.559 --> 13:30.727
Well, look who overpacked
for this vacation.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.813
Maybe your drone can fight the bugs.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.816
Did you know mosquito-borne
illnesses are on the rise?

13:35.899 --> 13:38.235
You should see what encephalitis
can do to your brain.

13:38.902 --> 13:41.864
I think I'm witnessing
what WebMD does to your brain.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.492
I wish I could see
what they're seeing out there.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.953
-Hilde.
-We can't just sit here.

13:48.829 --> 13:52.124
-We can't even see anything.
-I am not going in there.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.543
Me either.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.216
Maybe we don't have to.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.222
You think this is okay?

14:08.098 --> 14:10.893
I don't know.
I just-- I feel kinda weird about it.

14:10.976 --> 14:13.770
Who do you think
built that barrier in the lake?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.105
Yeah.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.359
Well, there aren't any signs,

14:19.443 --> 14:22.279
so we're not doing anything wrong
by being out here.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.579
All right. Let's just keep moving.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.589
Hello?

14:40.672 --> 14:42.132
Dad, come in.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.345
Dad, can you hear me?

14:46.428 --> 14:50.307
Hey, I'm here. Everything okay? Over.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.391
See anything yet?

14:51.475 --> 14:54.102
No, we got nothing. Nothing to report.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.395
Copy.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.439
You're such a nerd.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.359
I'm the nerd? He brought a drone.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.946
Of course I brought a drone.
Who do you think you're dealing with?

15:04.029 --> 15:06.532
It's my dad's. He taught me how to use it.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.243
We can fly above the trees,
see what we can find.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.630
-How do you fly it?
-Carefully, with no sudden movements.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.639
Let me try. Give it.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.517
No joyrides! This is expensive technology.

15:43.652 --> 15:44.862
Okay, here we go.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.288
It's so pretty.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.582
And empty. Can you go lower?

15:57.583 --> 15:58.792
Or maybe enhance.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.961
There is no enhance.
That's only in movies.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.754
Then this button here.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.007
Are you crazy? I'm driving.

16:06.967 --> 16:10.095
-Wait. Is that a building?
-Where?

16:10.179 --> 16:11.722
-I said don't touch.
-I didn't!

16:12.764 --> 16:14.850
Then why is it doing this?
I'm losing signal.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.227
-Pull up. Up, up!
-Donny, go up.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.146
-It's falling.
-I'm trying!

16:19.229 --> 16:21.899
-Up, up!
-The controller isn't working. No, no!

16:25.152 --> 16:26.153
Oh, my God!

16:26.987 --> 16:28.071
It wasn't me.

16:29.823 --> 16:32.367
Ginny! Mr. Lisko!

16:33.952 --> 16:34.953
Ginny!

16:36.455 --> 16:37.497
Mr. Lisko!

16:39.166 --> 16:41.668
Both my parents are out.
He couldn't have taken one of the cars.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.671
That's good, right? That means
they couldn't have gone too far.

16:51.553 --> 16:55.557
-What happened? Did it go out of range?
-No way.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.476
Did the battery die?

16:58.101 --> 16:59.561
It was at 100%.

17:01.355 --> 17:04.733
I've only seen this happen one time.
I think it might be a geofence.

17:04.816 --> 17:05.817
A what?

17:06.777 --> 17:10.906
A geofence. It's invisible like Wi-Fi,
but it shuts down drones.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.992
I ran into one by the airport once.

17:14.076 --> 17:16.036
The drone just fell right out of the sky.

17:16.662 --> 17:19.039
Sensitive areas like
government buildings, airports

17:19.122 --> 17:22.125
and big sporting events
are no-fly zones for drones.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.545
Wait a sec.
Did they have geofences in the '80s?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.714
Are you crazy?
Drones didn't exist in the '80s.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.675
They barely had real video games.

17:31.343 --> 17:34.221
So that means
it must have been put up recently.

17:34.972 --> 17:37.432
Which means that they know
there's something bad out there.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.352
And they're trying to hide it.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.355
We're on the right track.

17:44.273 --> 17:46.358
-My dad's gonna kill me.
-Yeah.

17:48.777 --> 17:49.778
Where are you going?

17:51.446 --> 17:52.489
You said it.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.410
Your dad's gonna kill you.
So we gotta go get your drone back.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.162
But didn't Frank and your dad
say to stay put?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.708
Frank's an officer of the law.
So basically it's illegal to leave, right?

18:03.584 --> 18:06.503
We saw where it fell.
We'll just go back, find it,

18:06.587 --> 18:08.964
and then come back before
they even know we were gone.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.465
I don't know about this.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.291
I feel like I've seen this before.

18:45.709 --> 18:46.752
Frankie.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.977
Looks like someone
built some serious infrastructure.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.897
But why?

19:09.024 --> 19:12.611
I think I saw a river. If we can
find that, we can track the drone.

19:12.694 --> 19:15.822
Let's make it quick.
I don't wanna be out here long.

19:16.365 --> 19:17.616
Maybe it's this way.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.329
Oh, no!

19:22.996 --> 19:26.625
No, no. That is not good. Not good.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.088
You kids still okay? Over.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.884
Hilde, do you copy?

19:36.468 --> 19:37.845
Answer it.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.639
Roger that.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.058
How's the boat?

19:49.606 --> 19:53.193
It's fine. We're fine.
How are things going out there?

19:53.861 --> 19:55.529
Yeah, looks like we found something.

19:55.612 --> 19:59.283
A pipe running through the woods.
I can't tell where it leads,

19:59.366 --> 20:01.785
but it must mean people
were using this island for something.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.413
-Stop. Did you see that?
-See what?

20:05.622 --> 20:07.332
Dad, what's going on?

20:07.416 --> 20:10.627
Yeah, Frank just thinks
he saw something. Or someone.

20:13.297 --> 20:17.301
Wait,
is there someone else on this island?

20:17.384 --> 20:19.845
I don't know.
Could have been an animal or something.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.848
We're gonna go check it out.
Just stay by the boat.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.908
Hilde, where are we?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.748
Which way do we go to get back?

20:52.169 --> 20:53.587
I don't know.

21:04.515 --> 21:05.516
My Jane,

21:06.808 --> 21:09.937
I always knew she was out of my league,

21:10.020 --> 21:13.440
but for some reason
she thought I was great.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.321
Doesn't that just make me
the luckiest guy in the world?

21:20.572 --> 21:22.366
I remember our first date.

21:22.449 --> 21:25.702
I was so nervous that I spilled red sauce
on my white shirt.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.457
And the waiter felt so bad for me

21:30.541 --> 21:33.794
that when I went in the bathroom,
he loaned me his shirt.

21:35.546 --> 21:38.340
Then the piano player played that song,

21:38.423 --> 21:42.135
and we danced.

21:45.013 --> 21:46.974
And I felt completely at home.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.977
She was such a good dancer.

21:50.978 --> 21:54.231
You'll see. She's gonna love this.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.693
Here comes the bus.

22:01.738 --> 22:03.657
Okay. Yeah.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.051
I remember seeing a clearing
before the drone went down,

22:23.135 --> 22:26.263
so it must be…

22:26.889 --> 22:28.640
this way.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.070
Mountains at my right, water at my left.

22:42.154 --> 22:43.572
Hilde!

22:47.743 --> 22:50.037
-Yeah?
-We should check in with your dad.

22:53.582 --> 22:55.167
Dad, come in. This is Scout.

22:57.669 --> 23:00.088
Dad? Dad, come in.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.842
What if something bad happened to them?

23:03.926 --> 23:06.887
-Dad, come in. It's Scout.
-Or someone bad.

23:06.970 --> 23:08.096
Frank?

23:10.098 --> 23:11.141
Nothing.

23:18.023 --> 23:20.442
Come on. We need to find your dad's drone

23:20.526 --> 23:23.320
and get back to the boat
before the storm hits.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.413
-There.
-Where?

23:38.544 --> 23:40.921
What are you thinking?
Think it could be a hunter?

23:42.422 --> 23:43.423
No way.

23:43.507 --> 23:46.260
If you think that looks like a hunter,
you've been in the city too long.

23:46.343 --> 23:47.427
Wait. There he goes.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.055
He's moving fast,
like he's looking for something.

23:50.138 --> 23:53.350
Yeah, or maybe he knows something.
Maybe he knows what's going on.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.771
Maybe. We should get back to the kids.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.273
Yeah, let's hustle.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.079
This looks familiar.

24:15.247 --> 24:17.249
The drone has to be close by.

24:30.012 --> 24:32.306
Is that an old World War II bunker?

24:32.389 --> 24:35.100
I don't think the Germans
invaded Washington state.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.103
-We should go in.
-What about back to the boat?

24:43.609 --> 24:47.070
"When thunder roars, go indoors."
Girl Scout handbook.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.322
You were in Girl Scouts?

24:48.405 --> 24:50.032
Well, no,

24:50.115 --> 24:51.575
but I did have to read their handbook

24:51.658 --> 24:53.619
for an article I was working on
in Brooklyn.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.330
It was an exposé
on who got to use the cookie profits.

24:57.331 --> 25:01.418
What if whoever's out here went in there?

25:02.711 --> 25:04.171
There's no way I'm going in there.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.300
Actually, I could be persuaded.

25:21.355 --> 25:22.731
This place has bad energy.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.484
Hold on.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.825
-Where's she going?
-I don't know.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.954
-What's she doing?
-I don't know.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.164
-Is she safe?
-You wanna go and find out?

25:39.248 --> 25:41.250
I don't wanna go and find out.
You go find out.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.668
It's dark in there.

25:43.252 --> 25:44.378
What is that?

25:47.714 --> 25:48.966
What's going on in there?

25:49.800 --> 25:51.343
You guys have to come see this.

25:59.351 --> 26:00.978
It's like some sort of lab.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.647
But it's like whoever worked here doing

26:05.148 --> 26:06.567
I don't wanna know what,

26:06.650 --> 26:09.820
it's like they just ran away
and left everything behind.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.135
Were they testing on animals?

26:38.056 --> 26:41.518
Why would someone
just leave everything there like that?

26:45.105 --> 26:47.608
Maybe we should go back outside.

26:55.490 --> 26:56.700
Hilde?

27:09.963 --> 27:11.798
That's not Frank or your dad.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.843
What's he doing?

27:15.427 --> 27:16.512
I don't wanna know.

27:17.012 --> 27:18.263
What were you thinking?

27:18.347 --> 27:20.933
The point of you staying home
was to keep an eye on them.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.601
How could you do that with Emma there?

27:22.684 --> 27:25.437
You're the one that dumps them on me
every time you need to leave.

27:25.521 --> 27:27.981
That is not fair. We're all part
of this family. We need to pitch in.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.151
Yeah, except for Dad and Hilde.
Their job comes before everything else,

27:31.235 --> 27:33.320
including you and me,
and Ginny and Pop-Pop.

27:33.403 --> 27:35.280
God forbid that they have
to go chasing some story

27:35.364 --> 27:37.282
right when I need to do something else.

27:37.366 --> 27:39.284
It's like democracy
is gonna die in darkness

27:39.368 --> 27:41.411
because I wanna hang out with my friends.

27:51.088 --> 27:53.882
-I think he's gone.
-Let's get back to the boat.

27:53.966 --> 27:57.052
But what about the drone?
We've gotta be getting close.

27:57.803 --> 28:00.013
I've seen enough today, Hilde.
Let the forest keep it.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.862
What is that?

28:17.614 --> 28:19.575
Wait. Is that the map?

28:22.786 --> 28:25.747
So you keep telling me that
you're gonna help me find my dad's drone,

28:25.831 --> 28:28.709
but this whole time you've been
looking for the X on that map?

28:29.501 --> 28:31.920
No, that is not okay.

28:33.005 --> 28:34.256
Did you know about this?

28:34.339 --> 28:37.718
I thought we were just gonna see what
we could see while looking for your drone.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.888
I didn't realize
you were straight up lying.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.641
You care more about the story
than you do about us.

28:44.725 --> 28:47.394
No, that's not true.

28:47.477 --> 28:50.772
It's just that what
Sam's dad saw before his plane crashed,

28:50.856 --> 28:52.774
this could be the key to finding Richie,

28:52.858 --> 28:55.903
and if we don't do it, who will?

28:55.986 --> 28:59.573
Literally Frank and your dad.
That's who's supposed to do it, Hilde.

28:59.656 --> 29:01.992
I've seen you do this to everyone else.

29:02.492 --> 29:05.913
Do whatever you gotta do to get the story,
no matter who gets hurt.

29:05.996 --> 29:07.122
But

29:08.707 --> 29:10.792
I didn't actually think you'd do it to me.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.570
Guys.

29:39.363 --> 29:41.740
Wait! You guys!

29:48.830 --> 29:49.831
Donny?

29:51.625 --> 29:52.626
Spoon?

29:55.128 --> 29:56.713
Where are you guys?

30:15.524 --> 30:16.692
Hilde!

30:18.110 --> 30:19.111
Hey, kids!

30:21.280 --> 30:24.283
-You think they're on the boat?
-I don't know. Let me take a look.

30:24.992 --> 30:25.993
Hilde!

30:27.369 --> 30:28.370
Guys?

30:32.416 --> 30:33.750
Hilde!

30:35.335 --> 30:37.546
Hilde, Donny, Spoon!

30:37.629 --> 30:39.298
Hilde, are you there? Copy?

30:42.009 --> 30:44.553
Donny, Spoon, do you hear me? Copy?

30:47.514 --> 30:48.599
I got nothing.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.310
Man, where are they?

30:51.393 --> 30:53.729
Maybe they just decided
to take cover further inland.

30:54.438 --> 30:55.898
No, no, no.

30:56.773 --> 30:59.443
No, if I know Hilde,
there's only one place she could be.

31:29.056 --> 31:32.768
Mountains at my right, water at my left.

31:48.325 --> 31:50.869
That's my babe right here. Right?

31:52.412 --> 31:54.248
Okay, you ready to go?

31:56.875 --> 31:59.920
Did you remember to pick up the flowers?

32:01.129 --> 32:02.923
We can just pick some of these.

32:04.842 --> 32:07.761
You are so smart, Matty.

32:08.428 --> 32:10.389
You know how your mother loves pink.

32:11.765 --> 32:14.935
Oh, my, aren't these pretty?
Let's get some more.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.899
Hilde!

32:22.025 --> 32:23.402
Can you hear me?

32:23.986 --> 32:25.445
Kids?

32:27.739 --> 32:28.740
Hilde!

32:28.824 --> 32:30.868
Are you sure this is where they're headed?

32:31.869 --> 32:33.036
Oh, man.

32:33.120 --> 32:34.329
It has to be.

32:34.746 --> 32:37.916
-Kids!
-Hilde!

32:38.000 --> 32:40.544
-Mr. Lisko!
-Frank!

32:40.627 --> 32:42.212
Thank God. You guys are okay.

32:42.296 --> 32:43.547
Wait. Where's Hilde?

32:44.006 --> 32:46.008
-We kinda--
-Where is she?

32:46.091 --> 32:47.885
We kinda got in a fight.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.887
I thought she was just gonna follow us.

32:50.721 --> 32:52.848
I'm sorry, Mr. Lisko.

32:54.308 --> 32:57.644
-She went after the X on the map.
-Oh, God.

32:57.728 --> 32:59.354
All right, come on. Come on.

33:17.247 --> 33:18.290
Dad?

33:20.375 --> 33:21.543
Is that you?

33:24.630 --> 33:25.797
Frank?

33:49.821 --> 33:51.281
Is anyone out there?

34:23.438 --> 34:24.982
What was that, Hank?

34:25.065 --> 34:27.484
Something's wrong. The engine's stalling.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.071
It's not going, Art.

34:31.154 --> 34:33.114
The engine's starving for fuel.
There's no way.

34:46.628 --> 34:47.920
Yeah, thank you.

34:48.005 --> 34:51.007
Oh, God. Trip is sending deputies
out to look for them.

34:51.091 --> 34:53.302
Emma went by the bike shop.
They're not there.

34:53.385 --> 34:54.553
Where else could they be?

34:54.636 --> 34:57.139
What other places
does Pop-Pop remember in this town?

34:57.222 --> 34:58.473
God, I don't know, Mom, okay?

34:58.557 --> 35:01.393
I don't have some encyclopedic knowledge
of his interests like Hilde does.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.730
I'm not as close with him
as everyone else is.

35:07.232 --> 35:10.110
I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm worried.

35:11.653 --> 35:13.614
Is there something else bothering you?

35:15.032 --> 35:17.701
Ginny and Pop-Pop are missing,
and it's my fault. Isn't that enough?

35:17.784 --> 35:20.162
-God, I always mess things up.
-Honey.

35:24.333 --> 35:25.876
I don't know. It's just…

35:28.629 --> 35:32.883
sometimes I feel like
even in the family, I'm all alone.

35:34.301 --> 35:36.637
Like I don't quite fit anywhere.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.765
I don't fit with anyone.

35:39.848 --> 35:41.475
You always fit with me.

35:44.436 --> 35:45.771
Okay?

35:46.647 --> 35:47.689
Okay.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.734
Hello?

35:51.777 --> 35:54.238
Oh, my God. Let's go.

35:54.321 --> 35:55.405
Yeah.

35:58.659 --> 36:00.953
What are you doing
out here all by yourself?

36:01.328 --> 36:02.788
What are you doing out here?

36:06.750 --> 36:07.918
I'm here because of this.

36:09.545 --> 36:14.007
After my friend at the NTSB
sent us that black box recording,

36:14.091 --> 36:16.343
I kept listening to it over and over.

36:16.426 --> 36:18.846
I used the airspeed
and vectoring information

36:18.929 --> 36:22.641
that Hank Gillis was sending back
to the air traffic controller

36:22.724 --> 36:24.393
to trace his flight pattern

36:25.018 --> 36:26.562
right to this island.

36:29.815 --> 36:32.317
Now, why are you here?

36:36.196 --> 36:37.406
Same reason.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.501
What do the other markings mean?

36:49.585 --> 36:51.795
Those are the areas I covered so far.

36:53.213 --> 36:56.717
I don't understand.
Why would you do all that?

36:58.302 --> 37:00.804
You thought Sam's dad
crashed his plane on purpose.

37:01.471 --> 37:04.600
I know. And I was wrong, Hilde.

37:05.184 --> 37:06.268
And that's why I'm here.

37:24.661 --> 37:27.998
I owe Sam a debt I can never repay,

37:28.081 --> 37:30.918
but at the very least,

37:31.001 --> 37:36.298
I can try to get the truth
as to what happened to his dad.

37:36.965 --> 37:39.134
To help Sam walk where his dad walked.

37:40.802 --> 37:42.846
Sam told me he moved to the reservation

37:42.930 --> 37:46.642
because he wanted to walk
on land his ancestors walked.

37:47.809 --> 37:50.395
-That it made him feel at peace.
-Yeah.

37:55.025 --> 37:57.277
Sam doesn't have to forgive you, you know?

38:00.322 --> 38:01.782
I know.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.536
I don't deserve that.

38:09.039 --> 38:11.750
Hilde! Thank God you're okay.

38:13.502 --> 38:14.503
Dad?

38:19.049 --> 38:20.300
What are you doing here?

38:21.426 --> 38:23.345
Just trying to make things right

38:24.221 --> 38:25.347
with Sam.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.393
Like my son said I should.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.019
Hilde, what are you doing?

38:31.103 --> 38:33.146
Hey, I told you not to leave the boat.

38:34.606 --> 38:38.277
I know. I'm sorry.
I just needed to know what's out there.

38:38.694 --> 38:40.821
What Richie might've been right about.

38:41.405 --> 38:43.115
Yeah, I know, sweetie.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.702
Yeah, I wanna know too. Hey, come here.

38:51.498 --> 38:53.500
-Do you hear that?
-Yeah.

38:56.461 --> 38:57.462
Come on.

39:08.265 --> 39:10.517
-Honey?
-Mommy!

39:10.601 --> 39:12.019
Oh, God.

39:12.978 --> 39:15.564
Thank you so much for calling me.

39:15.647 --> 39:19.109
I saw these two walking around.
They looked a little lost.

39:22.946 --> 39:24.031
Are you okay?

39:24.615 --> 39:25.741
Okay.

39:26.575 --> 39:27.910
It was right here.

39:28.911 --> 39:30.621
What?

39:37.044 --> 39:39.004
Oh, Syl.

40:23.298 --> 40:27.553
Dad, what if that's what Sam's dad saw?

40:41.275 --> 40:42.818
That's why all the birds are dying.

40:43.944 --> 40:47.322
Yeah, they're the only ones that
could reach the water up here, right?

40:47.906 --> 40:49.867
But what about the dead fish?

40:51.535 --> 40:52.953
The pond is miles away.

40:53.871 --> 40:55.414
Let me see the map.

41:01.044 --> 41:03.964
It's flowing directly into the lake
surrounding the island.

41:11.513 --> 41:14.266
The pollution is heading
straight towards our drinking water.

41:27.738 --> 41:29.990
We have to get a sample
of whatever that is.

41:33.243 --> 41:34.244
Yeah, I'll go.

41:35.621 --> 41:38.290
Frank, take the kids back to the boat.
I'll meet you there.

41:38.373 --> 41:41.043
-Yeah, I will.
-I'll be okay.

41:46.632 --> 41:49.635
-Hey, let's take cover.
-Come on. In the trees.

41:52.387 --> 41:55.474
Hurry. They must be patrolling the island.

42:03.148 --> 42:05.651
Come on, Hilde.
We've gotta get outta here.
