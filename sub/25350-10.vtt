WEBVTT

00:11.211 --> 00:14.279
I think he might have been
a stalker.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.880
I feel something worse
is coming,

00:15.882 --> 00:19.150
and I'm doing everything
I can to protect them.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.888
I think he abducted her.
I think he killed her.

00:23.890 --> 00:27.559
He confesses to 44 murders.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.759
"You're not safe.

00:28.761 --> 00:32.296
A bad ghost will come
and get you."

00:32.298 --> 00:37.034
I'm very worried about
anyone being here at all.

00:37.036 --> 00:42.273
This monster could become
abusive toward the living.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.377
And I just feel fear.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.113
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.115 --> 00:51.249
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:51.251 --> 00:52.450
I see dead people.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.719
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.654
I speak to dead people.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.590
She hates them, hates them.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.993
And they speak to me.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.462
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.933
It's a demon.
It's Satan.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.534
I rely on my partner.

01:10.536 --> 01:11.936
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.271
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.739
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:15.741 --> 01:19.410
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.812
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:20.814 --> 01:22.313
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:22.315 --> 01:23.815
It's my job to reveal them.

01:23.817 --> 01:26.351
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.286
But Steve and I never speak...

01:28.288 --> 01:30.355
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.556
...until the very end...

01:31.558 --> 01:33.625
I don't even want
to show you this.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.827
...when we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:35.829 --> 01:38.296
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.831
...or time to get out.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.299
You have to get out.

01:43.000 --> 01:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.179 --> 01:55.313
So I'm up here
in Highland Park, Illinois.

01:55.315 --> 01:57.782
It's about a half hour north
of Chicago.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.851
I got a call from a young mom
named Michelle.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.319
Now, she and her family
recently moved

02:02.321 --> 02:05.056
into what they thought would
have been their dream home,

02:05.058 --> 02:08.258
but after months of
relentless paranormal attacks,

02:08.261 --> 02:10.662
she says living there
is hell on Earth.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.266
Before Amy arrives,

02:15.268 --> 02:18.335
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:18.337 --> 02:22.273
Photographs, toys,
and other personal items

02:22.275 --> 02:25.410
have to be covered or removed.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.478
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

02:27.480 --> 02:29.080
for tonight's walk.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.891
There is a darkness here,

02:39.893 --> 02:43.027
like a complete layer
of darkness

02:43.029 --> 02:46.097
that's trying to get
through my protections,

02:46.099 --> 02:50.100
which is really concerning.

02:50.102 --> 02:53.571
This area -- it collects
the bad from people.

02:53.573 --> 02:56.774
Then I just got
people in misery and memories.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.253
So, Michelle,
I'm glad I'm here

03:08.255 --> 03:10.321
'cause when we spoke
on the phone,

03:10.323 --> 03:13.124
I could hear the emotions
in your voice.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.325
What the hell is going on?

03:14.327 --> 03:16.393
It's been living hell
around here.

03:16.395 --> 03:18.930
I'm in fear for
my children's safety.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.133
They're being attacked
physically, emotionally.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.668
So am I.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.736
Who all lives here
in the house?

03:25.738 --> 03:29.473
Well, here we have...

03:29.475 --> 03:32.076
This is my husband,
Matthew.
Okay.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.279
This is our 11-year-old son,
Teddy,

03:34.281 --> 03:36.281
and our darling
little daughter, Evie.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.748
She's 7.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.617
All right, Michelle, do me
a favor and give me a rundown

03:39.619 --> 03:41.085
of what the hell's
going on here.

03:41.087 --> 03:43.755
We've been hearing
disembodied voices.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.758
We have objects
that move on their own.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.093
We've been having
electrical issues.

03:49.095 --> 03:52.229
We've also been having
shadow figures.

03:52.231 --> 03:55.032
Recently, there have been
physical attacks,

03:55.034 --> 03:57.502
and my daughter's health
is being affected.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.770
In what way?

03:58.772 --> 04:01.773
She keeps getting sick --
nausea, vomiting.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.307
And you believe
it's the paranormal?

04:03.309 --> 04:04.441
I do.

04:04.443 --> 04:05.843
She didn't get sick
like this before.

04:05.845 --> 04:08.579
Taken her to the doctors
several times,

04:08.581 --> 04:11.849
and they say that
there's nothing wrong with her.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.651
How you dealing with it
on a day-to-day basis?

04:13.653 --> 04:17.321
When we're home, the feelings
that you feel are intensified.

04:17.322 --> 04:20.992
Something that would normally,
you know, might annoy you

04:20.994 --> 04:23.527
just piss you off
to high hell.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.997
What do you think is here?

04:25.999 --> 04:29.467
Well, I think my ex-fiancÃ©,
Casey, is here.

04:29.469 --> 04:33.738
He died when he was 21,

04:33.740 --> 04:38.209
and it was very,
very sudden.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.811
Sorry.
No, it's okay.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.345
What were
the circumstances?

04:41.347 --> 04:46.551
The doctor said that it felt
like an asthma attack to him.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.019
This is him.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.758
He died in Chicago,

04:53.760 --> 04:57.695
and he took a very large
part of me with him,

04:57.697 --> 05:00.698
but he has found me
wherever we've gone.

05:00.700 --> 05:04.102
I mean, you don't think Casey
is causing any harm?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.236
No, no.

05:05.238 --> 05:08.640
I think if anything,
he's trying to protect us.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.308
Okay.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.776
What do you think
whatever's here wants?

05:12.778 --> 05:15.813
I think there's something here
that wants to

05:15.815 --> 05:18.849
suck the life out of me
and my children.

05:18.851 --> 05:21.052
It feels like
it's slowly killing me.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.594
So, this is not good.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.995
I'm seeing a lot of dead people.

05:44.077 --> 05:47.411
There's a bunch of people.

05:47.413 --> 05:50.748
It's almost like
they're putting...

05:50.750 --> 05:53.351
dead people on hold in there.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.823
I guess that's what
they were talking about --

05:58.825 --> 06:01.158
this layer of darkness.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.163
There's, like, one dead female
who really wants

06:06.165 --> 06:07.365
the **** out of there.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.440
All right, Michelle, so
obviously this is the kitchen.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.708
What's going on in here?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.710
We're having a lot
of electrical issues.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.447
We have the TV turning
on and off by itself,

06:23.449 --> 06:26.718
speakers connecting
and disconnecting...
Okay.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.921
...and all the lights
in the house have been turned on

06:29.923 --> 06:32.055
when we were all asleep.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.858
So, now, do you have
those motion detectors --

06:33.860 --> 06:35.459
when you walk into the room,
the lights go on?

06:35.461 --> 06:37.528
- We do not.
- Okay, anything else?

06:37.530 --> 06:41.532
I was meditating one day,
and as I'm looking up,

06:41.534 --> 06:46.871
I'm seeing all this black gunk
come out of my mouth

06:46.873 --> 06:49.073
and raise up to the ceiling.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.077
And there's a woman, like,
plastered against the ceiling,

06:53.079 --> 06:56.881
and the black gunk
is encircling her

06:56.883 --> 06:59.483
and going in and out
of her mouth.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.553
So, I know meditation can be
very relaxing, right?

07:02.555 --> 07:04.021
So is it possible
you fell asleep

07:04.023 --> 07:05.356
and this was just
a nightmare?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.757
No chance.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.826
I've meditated plenty of times
to know the difference.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.829
Okay. You got some crazy
**** going on here.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.165
Yes.
I'm terrified.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.766
I think
it wants to kill me.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.839
I'm seeing an elderly woman.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.842
She causes
a lot of **** ruckus,

07:24.844 --> 07:26.511
lots of noise at night.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.112
I do believe she lived here.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.980
You know, she hasn't moved on.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.117
So, I think the living
are hearing, you know,

07:33.119 --> 07:36.988
basically an elderly woman
up at night

07:36.990 --> 07:39.991
and just fussing around
and making stuff and cleaning

07:39.993 --> 07:44.862
and talking to her animals
and mumbling.

07:44.864 --> 07:47.265
I get, like,
the fear factor here.

07:52.939 --> 07:55.139
Okay, so what's
going on up here?

07:55.141 --> 07:58.476
Very often, it will feel
as if someone or something

07:58.478 --> 08:01.412
is sitting on the bed
with me

08:01.414 --> 08:05.816
or crawls onto the bed
or even lays down next to me.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.084
I mean, is it possible

08:07.086 --> 08:08.219
that's your husband
getting into the bed?

08:08.221 --> 08:10.621
It happens whether
he's in the bed or not.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.023
Anything else going on
in this room?

08:12.025 --> 08:15.760
I've been scratched
and had bruises left on me.

08:15.762 --> 08:19.029
I have a couple pictures,

08:19.031 --> 08:25.102
and these are each
when I have been fully awake.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.970
Anything else like this
happen to you?

08:26.972 --> 08:27.905
Yes.

08:27.907 --> 08:32.775
I have been attacked
sexually.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.446
And how often
does this happen?

08:35.448 --> 08:37.847
It happens up to
a few times a month.

08:37.850 --> 08:43.254
I'm able to feel the hand,
like, moving down me.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.788
I'm afraid to even ask you
if there's anything else.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.325
I mean,
are you sleeping at all?

08:47.327 --> 08:48.525
Barely.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.728
I have nightmares
all the time,

08:50.730 --> 08:51.996
every single night.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.000
By far the most jarring
and horrible for me

08:56.002 --> 08:58.269
is the ones about my kids.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.271
I've seen them drown.
I've seen them shot.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.074
I've seen them stabbed
like they're being murdered.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.544
They're killing themselves.
They...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.880
All right.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.547
I feel something worse
is coming,

09:10.549 --> 09:12.950
and I'm doing everything
I can to protect them,

09:12.952 --> 09:14.818
and I can't
protect them.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.219
Yeah. Come here.
Come here.

09:16.221 --> 09:17.488
I'm sorry.

09:26.365 --> 09:29.233
There's a strange-looking
dead guy out here.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.503
You can see him,
but always in a blur.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.906
I call him the blurry man
'cause he literally looks

09:35.908 --> 09:39.843
like a watercolored painting
that was smudged.

09:44.249 --> 09:47.251
So, the blurry guy,
when he's up here,

09:47.253 --> 09:49.186
likes this room.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.125
He likes to watch.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.859
If the lights are off,

09:55.861 --> 10:00.464
they might see him
as a shadow person,

10:00.466 --> 10:02.599
and he can be physical.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.936
Nightmares, nightmares.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.338
I'm gonna say
that he likes this person.

10:07.340 --> 10:10.875
This is an actual living person
in the house.

10:15.882 --> 10:20.884
I think he thinks if he can
completely manifest, like,

10:20.886 --> 10:24.155
he'd kind of be alive again
or something,

10:24.157 --> 10:26.023
and I think that's not good.

10:52.828 --> 10:54.628
So, Teddy,
how old are you?

10:54.630 --> 10:55.696
11.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.831
11. okay.

10:57.833 --> 10:59.099
So, I was talking to Mom,
and she said

10:59.101 --> 11:01.168
there's some scary things
going on in the house.

11:01.170 --> 11:02.369
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.704
Can you tell me about
some of the things

11:03.706 --> 11:05.239
that are bothering you here?

11:05.241 --> 11:09.976
I play with my toys on my desk,
and I go to sleep.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.645
I wake up.
They're on the ground.

11:11.647 --> 11:13.513
Okay, so when you go to sleep
at night,

11:13.515 --> 11:14.714
you keep your toys
up on top?

11:14.716 --> 11:15.915
Yeah, right there.

11:15.917 --> 11:17.116
And you wake up,
they're on...

11:17.118 --> 11:18.518
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.253
You think your little sister
is playing tricks on you?

11:20.255 --> 11:21.588
No.

11:21.590 --> 11:23.323
All right, buddy,
anything else?

11:23.325 --> 11:25.992
Whenever I'm alone,
I feel like I'm being watched.

11:25.994 --> 11:27.661
Do you have any idea
what it might be

11:27.663 --> 11:30.730
that's actually
watching you?

11:30.732 --> 11:33.666
Not really,
but I know that it --

11:33.668 --> 11:36.937
most of the time,
it makes me feel nervous.

11:36.939 --> 11:39.740
You get a sense that whatever's
here is trying to hurt you?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.274
Sometimes, yes.

11:44.279 --> 11:45.546
I don't like this.

11:48.817 --> 11:51.751
Blurry dude
comes up in here.

11:55.024 --> 11:59.092
So he can open and close doors.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.961
He does that sometimes.

12:00.963 --> 12:05.765
If he wants to spy,
or watch like he does,

12:05.767 --> 12:10.370
he has to open the door to see.

12:10.372 --> 12:13.773
I think he has a particular
attachment to this room.

12:19.314 --> 12:20.847
He does kind of give this person

12:20.849 --> 12:23.182
the feeling that they shouldn't
be in here,

12:23.184 --> 12:25.718
feeling like, "Got to go" --

12:25.720 --> 12:29.722
tension, anxiety, nervous.

12:34.863 --> 12:36.596
So, Matt, I was talking
to your wife today,

12:36.598 --> 12:39.800
and she mentioned
that she thinks

12:39.802 --> 12:41.134
whatever's in this house
is dangerous,

12:41.136 --> 12:43.470
and especially dangerous
for the kids.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.205
Do you have any opinions
on that?

12:45.207 --> 12:46.473
I've always been a skeptic

12:46.475 --> 12:49.809
and not really believed
in this sort of thing.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.877
So let me ask you
a question.

12:50.879 --> 12:52.746
Have you had
any experiences at all?

12:52.748 --> 12:54.347
Yeah.

12:54.349 --> 12:56.950
A lot of times,
I will hear voices,

12:56.952 --> 12:59.686
sometimes footsteps.

12:59.688 --> 13:01.154
Okay, anything else?

13:01.156 --> 13:04.091
Sometimes when I'm going
up the stairs in the basement,

13:04.093 --> 13:05.292
I get this feeling
like something's

13:05.294 --> 13:06.493
pulling me back down,

13:06.495 --> 13:09.629
like a magnetic
or, like, an emotional pull.

13:09.631 --> 13:11.031
So you've had a lot
of experiences

13:11.033 --> 13:12.632
for somebody
that's a skeptic so far.

13:12.634 --> 13:14.301
I'm just not 100%.

13:14.303 --> 13:16.636
I'm having a really hard time
with it.

13:16.638 --> 13:17.971
Why do you think that is?

13:17.973 --> 13:20.173
Part of me
kind of feels like

13:20.175 --> 13:23.844
I'm not providing
and protecting,

13:23.846 --> 13:26.312
doing my job as a father.

13:26.314 --> 13:28.581
But what could I do,
you know?

13:33.055 --> 13:34.454
This is weird.

13:37.258 --> 13:40.727
So, I don't know when,
but at some point,

13:40.729 --> 13:42.996
somebody collected --

13:42.998 --> 13:47.467
somehow collected or captured
all these dead people.

13:47.469 --> 13:49.870
It's like a box, in a clear box,

13:49.872 --> 13:52.539
and I can see these dead people
are wanting out.

13:57.079 --> 13:58.812
Really loud.
It hurts.

13:58.814 --> 14:01.281
They're dark.
They're really dark.

14:01.283 --> 14:03.083
Pain and misery.

14:07.823 --> 14:10.023
So, Evelyn, sweetie,
how old are you?

14:10.025 --> 14:11.091
7.

14:11.093 --> 14:13.894
Okay. So I was talking
to Mommy today.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.896
She was telling me about
some of the scary things

14:15.898 --> 14:18.231
that are going on.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.900
Yeah, can you tell me about some
of the stuff that's scaring you?

14:20.902 --> 14:24.771
When I go down
in the basement,

14:24.773 --> 14:28.975
I feel like people are
following me, chasing me.

14:28.977 --> 14:30.243
Like, kind of like ghosts?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.978
So, dead people.

14:33.048 --> 14:34.981
Okay, so anything else,
sweetie?

14:34.983 --> 14:39.585
I kind of feel like there's
people in my head, saying,

14:39.587 --> 14:40.921
"You're not safe.

14:40.923 --> 14:43.990
A bad ghost will come
and get you."

14:43.992 --> 14:45.992
So, you have a voice
that tells you

14:45.994 --> 14:47.661
that you may have
a bad ghost in here?

14:47.663 --> 14:49.195
Okay.

14:49.197 --> 14:51.331
You feel like
it wants to hurt you?

14:51.333 --> 14:52.799
Kay.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.935
Mommy was saying that you've
been getting sick a lot lately.

14:54.937 --> 14:58.204
One minute of cold,
I get sick.

14:58.206 --> 15:00.874
If we can fix this, you want
to stay in this house?

15:06.015 --> 15:07.614
Don't like this room.

15:11.153 --> 15:13.352
Horrible, horrible.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.294
So, I'm seeing this guy,
and he's, like,

15:21.296 --> 15:24.230
dropped to his hands and knees,
and he's, like, trying to pray.

15:24.232 --> 15:26.366
He's like, "Ahhhh."

15:26.368 --> 15:29.302
So I'm thinking maybe
this person is sick.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.906
He's praying for somebody --
whoever's in this bed.

15:36.912 --> 15:39.912
And I see him
falling to his knees

15:39.914 --> 15:42.049
and starting to pray,
and then it's, "Whoomp,"

15:42.051 --> 15:47.987
and then becomes visibly
this thing,

15:47.989 --> 15:50.056
like a monster.

15:50.058 --> 15:54.661
It's, like, got red skin,
like, a reddish-orange skin,

15:54.663 --> 16:01.934
stringy, dark, dirty hair,

16:01.936 --> 16:05.004
long twisted face.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.941
Do you have any idea
what this thing is yet?

16:07.943 --> 16:09.342
I don't know.

16:09.344 --> 16:10.677
There's illness.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.746
Stomach is
very, very, very bad.

16:13.748 --> 16:15.549
So is this thing
dangerous?

16:15.551 --> 16:20.153
Yes. It can interact
with the living,

16:20.155 --> 16:24.091
I think, being abusive,
scaring them.

16:24.093 --> 16:26.560
It's **** insane in here.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.813
Michelle is convinced
all the electrical stuff

16:46.815 --> 16:49.949
happening in her house is
related to the activity there.

16:49.951 --> 16:52.552
I'm heading back there now
to meet an electrical inspector

16:52.554 --> 16:54.953
to find out if there's
a simpler explanation

16:54.955 --> 16:57.823
to the things Michelle and
her family are going through.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.963
Will, thanks for coming out
and meeting me.

17:04.964 --> 17:06.298
I appreciate it.
No problem.
No problem.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.700
So, my clients here
are having all kinds

17:08.702 --> 17:10.368
of electrical problems
in the house.

17:10.371 --> 17:12.505
Stuff's going on and off
on its own.

17:12.507 --> 17:14.307
Can you think of anything
that might cause that?

17:14.309 --> 17:16.909
Well, it could be
some electrical issues.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.777
We're right near
the high-tension lines.

17:18.779 --> 17:21.113
Sometimes you get
interference from that.

17:21.115 --> 17:23.115
Okay, so do me a favor.
Go in there, do your thing.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.383
Inspect this place for me,

17:24.385 --> 17:25.917
and let me know
if there's any problems.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.788
Beautiful.
Okay.

17:28.790 --> 17:31.791
I have no idea what Amy's
gonna find during her walk,

17:31.793 --> 17:33.859
but when you work a case,
you have to rule out

17:33.861 --> 17:37.062
the obvious first,
and that's what I'm doing here.

17:37.064 --> 17:39.365
If there are electrical issues
in the house,

17:39.367 --> 17:40.999
it could explain
some of what Michelle

17:41.001 --> 17:42.668
and her family are dealing with.

17:42.670 --> 17:45.304
We'd get that issue fixed,
and they'd be good to go.

17:47.475 --> 17:48.740
All right.
So, how'd it go?

17:48.742 --> 17:51.477
Pretty good, pretty good.
Nothing really major.

17:51.479 --> 17:53.479
All right,
so as far as devices

17:53.481 --> 17:55.081
turning on and off
by themselves,

17:55.083 --> 17:56.815
nothing you've found
would cause that?

17:56.817 --> 17:58.751
No, nothing electrical.

17:58.753 --> 18:00.052
Okay.

18:03.491 --> 18:06.092
I'm seeing the blurry man again.

18:06.094 --> 18:07.826
How would it
interact with the living?

18:07.828 --> 18:09.228
He does move objects.

18:09.230 --> 18:11.831
He can open and close doors.

18:11.833 --> 18:13.899
He can affect electricity.

18:13.901 --> 18:17.903
Everything will go on
and be crazy.

18:17.905 --> 18:22.108
Is that anything that the living
are in danger from?

18:22.110 --> 18:24.243
It might be
a slight possibility

18:24.245 --> 18:29.382
if he could become enraged
or have a kind of mental break,

18:29.384 --> 18:31.317
and then I don't know
what could happen.

18:33.587 --> 18:35.854
We've done cases
in the Chicago area before,

18:35.856 --> 18:38.057
so I already have
some connections here.

18:38.059 --> 18:39.658
I asked my old buddy
John Schmidt,

18:39.660 --> 18:42.127
who's an historian,
to do some digging for me.

18:42.129 --> 18:43.729
Now, he says
when the original owner

18:43.731 --> 18:45.531
of Michelle's property died,

18:45.533 --> 18:48.267
his wife was so desperate
to keep the property,

18:48.269 --> 18:51.003
she did something
he's never seen before.

18:51.005 --> 18:53.239
It sounds like it's really
gonna help my case.

19:00.281 --> 19:02.281
Well, John, thanks for
meeting me and helping me out.

19:02.283 --> 19:04.549
So, the original owners
of my clients' property --

19:04.551 --> 19:06.285
let's start there
with who they were

19:06.287 --> 19:07.553
and when did they
get there?

19:07.555 --> 19:09.688
That was
John and Elizabeth Corcoran,

19:09.690 --> 19:10.957
and they came from Ireland,

19:10.959 --> 19:13.225
bought your clients' property
in 1846--

19:13.227 --> 19:14.826
a newly married couple.

19:14.828 --> 19:16.828
They lived there.
They had three children.

19:16.830 --> 19:18.764
So, now, I know
the husband dies.

19:18.766 --> 19:20.032
When does that happen?

19:20.034 --> 19:22.768
He starts getting these pains
in his mouth.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.236
It turns out
he's got mouth cancer.

19:24.238 --> 19:25.971
Geez.
And, yeah, he hangs on,

19:25.973 --> 19:30.710
and he dies in July of 1859,
and he's only in his 40s.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.979
We got the death certificate
right here.

19:33.981 --> 19:35.581
So he's, what, 44?

19:35.583 --> 19:37.183
Yeah, yeah, 44.

19:37.185 --> 19:38.583
John, you mentioned
on the phone

19:38.585 --> 19:40.386
that the wife did something
crazy after the husband died.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.854
What's the story
with that?

19:41.856 --> 19:46.192
John Corcoran had left
the house to his wife...
Okay.

19:46.194 --> 19:49.328
...but the property --
your clients' property --

19:49.330 --> 19:50.596
he left
to the three children,

19:50.598 --> 19:52.999
and they were
under 12 years of age,

19:53.001 --> 19:55.601
and, plus, he left this
whole big mountain of debt,

19:55.603 --> 19:58.871
and Elizabeth didn't have
any way to pay this debt.

19:58.873 --> 20:02.141
She actually sues
the kids in court

20:02.143 --> 20:05.477
to try to get control
of your clients' property.

20:05.479 --> 20:06.812
What happens
with the lawsuit?

20:06.814 --> 20:09.081
Well, she won the lawsuit,
but it was only temporary

20:09.083 --> 20:12.418
because she still owed
all of these debts,

20:12.420 --> 20:13.819
and she lost the property
again anyway,

20:13.821 --> 20:15.554
and they had to
sell it at auction.

20:15.556 --> 20:17.356
All right, so John,
she loses the property,

20:17.358 --> 20:18.623
loses the house.

20:18.625 --> 20:20.025
What happens to her?

20:20.027 --> 20:22.227
Well, Elizabeth and kids --
they're left with nothing.

20:22.229 --> 20:23.896
They had to sell this house
at auction,

20:23.898 --> 20:25.898
but then in
the bizarre twist,

20:25.900 --> 20:30.703
she marries the man who bought
the property at auction.

20:30.705 --> 20:32.438
He's several years older
than her.
Okay.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.372
This is
Frederick William Tillman.

20:34.374 --> 20:36.208
All right. So now she's back
on my clients' property.

20:36.210 --> 20:37.176
How's it go for her?

20:37.178 --> 20:41.313
Unfortunately,
a few years later,

20:41.315 --> 20:44.516
Frederick William Tillman
died in 1874.

20:44.518 --> 20:48.253
He's 72 years old,
and for some reason,

20:48.255 --> 20:51.256
he didn't leave a will
with his wife in it,

20:51.258 --> 20:54.794
so once again,
she loses your clients' land.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.794
Okay.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.996
Second time a widow,

20:56.998 --> 20:59.865
second time
losing your clients' land.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.201
Lost it all.
Sad situation.

21:06.207 --> 21:08.541
I'm seeing
the elderly woman again.

21:08.543 --> 21:10.409
Can you tell anything
about her in life?

21:10.411 --> 21:12.344
I do believe she lived here,

21:12.346 --> 21:17.016
but she's in denial about
basically everything.

21:17.018 --> 21:19.885
She was little,
maybe Italian descent.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.087
I'm not sure.

21:21.089 --> 21:23.289
I'm getting, like,
late 70s with her.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.824
So I think that
she died here, I do,

21:25.826 --> 21:27.626
or started
her death process here --

21:27.628 --> 21:29.962
probably heart,
something with the heart.

21:34.701 --> 21:38.037
So it's really not good.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.514
For more information
about the show

21:48.516 --> 21:49.982

21:57.391 --> 21:58.357
and we'll help if we can.

22:13.117 --> 22:15.050
So far, I've got
a mother worried sick

22:15.052 --> 22:17.920
over the safety of her kids
on a property

22:17.922 --> 22:21.123
where one of the original owners
lost her land twice.

22:23.794 --> 22:27.528
But I want to see
if there's anything else.

22:27.530 --> 22:30.165
Searching through old records,
I find a murder that happened

22:30.167 --> 22:32.467
near Michelle's house
back in the '40s.

22:34.872 --> 22:37.271
So I'm headed over to meet
a true-crime author.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.141
He says the perp was one of
the most prolific serial killers

22:40.143 --> 22:41.676
in U.S. history,

22:41.678 --> 22:43.211
and the guy claimed
he put a curse

22:43.213 --> 22:45.680
on everyone involved
in bringing him down.

22:53.090 --> 22:55.289
Well, Rich, I
appreciate you looking
into this case for me.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.825
Now, let's start with
the woman

22:56.827 --> 22:58.293
who was murdered
near my clients' property.

22:58.295 --> 22:59.695
What do we know about her?

22:59.697 --> 23:01.897
Alta Bernice Fulkerson.

23:01.899 --> 23:06.101
She was a 35-year-old
spinster living with her parents

23:06.103 --> 23:08.236
not far from
your clients' property.

23:08.238 --> 23:09.971
Let's talk about the murder.
What happened?

23:09.973 --> 23:12.240
Her parents had gone away
for the weekend.

23:12.242 --> 23:13.775
In the wee hours
of the morning,

23:13.777 --> 23:16.044
a criminal thug entered
the residence,

23:16.046 --> 23:17.512
dragged her from the house,

23:17.514 --> 23:19.982
assaulted her,
and left her for dead.

23:23.686 --> 23:27.322
I see a dead male wearing, like,

23:27.324 --> 23:29.657
a trench coat and a hat.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.725
He's black.

23:30.727 --> 23:32.194
He's in his 40s or 50s,

23:32.196 --> 23:35.797
but always in the shadows.

23:35.799 --> 23:38.533
I think he might have been
a stalker.

23:38.535 --> 23:42.604
He's about dominating
and sexually motivated.

23:42.606 --> 23:45.474
Then I'm seeing this woman.

23:45.476 --> 23:48.276
She was 20 to 35.

23:48.278 --> 23:50.812
I think he abducted her.
I think he killed her.

23:50.814 --> 23:51.880
And I think he buried her

23:51.882 --> 23:56.618
in possibly then
what was a field.

23:56.620 --> 23:58.086
All right, so what's
the official cause of death

23:58.088 --> 24:00.021
on this poor lady?

24:00.023 --> 24:03.491
The official cause
was blunt-force trauma.

24:03.493 --> 24:08.563
It's probable that she was
sexually assaulted.

24:08.565 --> 24:10.431
So, from our conversation
on the phone,

24:10.433 --> 24:12.367
I know this guy was caught.
How'd that happen?

24:12.369 --> 24:16.371
So, five years pass.
The case goes cold.

24:16.373 --> 24:21.242
In 1947, a 46-year-old drifter
named Jake Bird

24:21.244 --> 24:23.578
is apprehended
in Tacoma, Washington,

24:23.580 --> 24:25.113
fleeing the scene
of the crime

24:25.115 --> 24:28.449
where he had murdered
a mother and a daughter.

24:28.451 --> 24:30.919
- This is him?
- That's Jake Bird.

24:30.921 --> 24:34.055
There seems to be a pattern
to his homicides.

24:34.057 --> 24:38.726
He bludgeoned and then
sexually assaulted the victims.

24:42.866 --> 24:48.736
There are some random dead
that come from over here...

24:53.544 --> 24:58.346
...and they're naked,
and it's mostly women.

24:58.348 --> 25:01.415
I see them coming out
of the ground.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.750
They're relatively young, too.

25:02.752 --> 25:06.621
I'd say all of them --
like, 35 and under.

25:06.623 --> 25:12.760
I think that these women were
killed over a 10-year time span.

25:12.762 --> 25:16.764
They were raped and murdered
and dumped.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.099
By separate
different people?

25:18.101 --> 25:20.568
No, same person.

25:20.570 --> 25:22.236
All right,
so now he's pretty much

25:22.238 --> 25:23.972
caught red-handed
in Tacoma.

25:23.974 --> 25:25.373
What happened
with that case?

25:25.375 --> 25:29.511
He's convicted of the murder
of the two Tacoma women,

25:29.513 --> 25:32.180
and he is sentenced to death
on the gallows.

25:32.182 --> 25:33.648
Okay, so they're
gonna hang him.

25:33.650 --> 25:37.585
As the execution date
draws closer, Bird panics.

25:37.587 --> 25:40.855
He confesses to 44 murders
in an effort

25:40.857 --> 25:42.991
to get his sentence
commuted to life.

25:42.993 --> 25:44.326
How's that work out
for him?

25:44.328 --> 25:46.795
Well, it doesn't work out
according to his plan.

25:46.797 --> 25:48.196
He's executed.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.664
Now, Rich, you mentioned
on the phone

25:49.666 --> 25:52.800
that this guy put a curse on
the people that prosecuted him.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.269
What's the story
with that?

25:54.271 --> 25:56.871
Jake Bird vowed that
all the people

25:56.873 --> 26:01.475
involved with his prosecution
were going to die before he did.

26:01.477 --> 26:04.746
Within less than
a year's time,

26:04.748 --> 26:08.950
five individuals die
of a heart attack,

26:08.952 --> 26:12.420
including the deputy sheriff
who he confessed to

26:12.422 --> 26:15.023
and the presiding judge
at the trial.

26:15.025 --> 26:16.024
You're kidding me.

26:16.026 --> 26:17.959
This is all documented.

26:17.961 --> 26:19.561
What are the chances
of that?

26:22.432 --> 26:25.300
These women --
they do go into the house...

26:28.839 --> 26:31.239
...but it's only
when they're called.

26:31.241 --> 26:33.041
You don't know
by whom or what?

26:33.043 --> 26:34.643
I'd say a living person.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.982
The only thing I could, like,
maybe think of

26:40.984 --> 26:45.520
is that somebody's a sensitive,
and they're dreaming this.

26:45.522 --> 26:48.322
Somebody's having dreams
about women,

26:48.324 --> 26:50.792
I mean, who were murdered
or something.

26:50.794 --> 26:52.927
They are seeking whoever's
putting the call out,

26:52.929 --> 26:54.529
seeking that person.

27:02.939 --> 27:05.539
I saw several disturbing things
on my walk,

27:05.541 --> 27:06.941
but two stood out --

27:06.943 --> 27:10.212
first, the monster
in the upstairs bedroom.

27:10.214 --> 27:13.814
There was a younger male

27:13.816 --> 27:19.421
who then transformed
into a monster.

27:19.423 --> 27:24.125
The eyes were just kind of
black, but also kind of twisted.

27:26.429 --> 27:29.163
The top of the eyes
are off.

27:29.165 --> 27:32.367
Okay.

27:32.369 --> 27:36.371
Next, I described the trapped
souls in the basement.

27:36.373 --> 27:39.240
I saw a naked woman

27:39.242 --> 27:43.978
who was trying to get out.

27:43.980 --> 27:46.514
I could actually see her palm
being smushed

27:46.516 --> 27:50.318
against this...
invisible door.

27:52.856 --> 27:55.523
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:55.525 --> 27:57.325
Yes, that's what I saw.

28:23.685 --> 28:26.619
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:26.621 --> 28:28.822
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:28.824 --> 28:32.025
and our clients
for the first time.

28:32.027 --> 28:35.295
So, Amy, I'd like you to meet
Michelle and her husband, Matt.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.031
Now, they moved into this house
about eight months ago

28:38.033 --> 28:41.701
with their two sweet kids.

28:41.703 --> 28:43.437
This is Teddy, who's 11,

28:43.439 --> 28:45.905
and this is Evelyn,
who is 7.

28:45.907 --> 28:47.307
Michelle says
something in the house

28:47.309 --> 28:48.975
is attacking her
and the kids,

28:48.977 --> 28:51.845
and if you can't find a way
to stop it,

28:51.847 --> 28:53.313
someone's gonna die.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.715
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

28:55.717 --> 28:57.784
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

29:00.856 --> 29:05.725
So, when I got here,
I encountered a male,

29:05.727 --> 29:10.464
and he is
<i>really</i> active here.

29:10.466 --> 29:12.732
He's rather thin
and tall.

29:12.734 --> 29:15.268
I know he had light skin
and darker hair.

29:15.270 --> 29:16.736
I called him
the blurry man

29:16.738 --> 29:19.473
because he looks like
blurred watercolor,

29:19.475 --> 29:21.942
you know, so there's
no real definition.

29:21.944 --> 29:25.412
The major thing that he affects
is electricity,

29:25.414 --> 29:27.948
so nothing here really,
you know,

29:27.950 --> 29:30.217
works the way it should.

29:30.219 --> 29:35.155
I was woken up at 4:15 a.m.
one night

29:35.157 --> 29:38.759
by a Bluetooth speaker
blaring,

29:38.761 --> 29:41.962
and the TV channels
will sometimes

29:41.964 --> 29:44.898
switch inputs
all by itself.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.699
I brought in
a certified master inspector --

29:46.701 --> 29:48.568
basically an electrician.

29:49.972 --> 29:52.973
He couldn't find anything
with the stuff going on and off.

29:52.975 --> 29:54.907
Interesting.

29:54.909 --> 29:58.311
The most concerning thing
was that he can

29:58.313 --> 29:59.579
be physical with the living,

29:59.581 --> 30:02.381
so he may be able
to touch you.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.650
I experience that
all the time.

30:04.652 --> 30:06.652
It makes me feel like
I'm going crazy.

30:06.654 --> 30:09.256
And, like,
he specifically...

30:09.258 --> 30:10.924
Like, the master bedroom --

30:10.926 --> 30:14.461
he does like one person
in there in particular.

30:14.463 --> 30:19.265
The tall, thin guy, like,
messing with you.

30:19.267 --> 30:23.203
I mean, it sounds just like
Casey, right?

30:26.008 --> 30:27.941
Who's Casey?

30:27.943 --> 30:30.610
When I met Michelle,
her fiancÃ© had passed away

30:30.612 --> 30:35.415
of a freak-accident
asthma attack.

30:35.417 --> 30:38.618
Casey was 21
when he died.

30:38.620 --> 30:44.290
I've always, you know,
kind of felt him around.

30:44.292 --> 30:46.159
I got a photo of him
right here.

30:51.033 --> 30:55.302
It seems to me that
it could possibly be him.

30:55.304 --> 31:00.574
I feel, like, guilty
that Casey's here.

31:00.576 --> 31:05.311
I feel like it must be,
like, my fault somehow.

31:05.313 --> 31:10.517
The weight of it is almost
like losing him over again.

31:10.519 --> 31:15.221
You've said this blurry guy
can get physical.

31:15.223 --> 31:17.657
We need to talk about some
of the issues you're having.

31:17.659 --> 31:22.862
So, I get touched,
like, sexually.

31:22.864 --> 31:24.664
I can, like, feel the --

31:24.666 --> 31:29.202
his fingers or hand, like,
going down my stomach.

31:29.204 --> 31:30.469
Tell her about
the other stuff --

31:30.471 --> 31:31.871
the scratching,
the bruising.

31:31.873 --> 31:34.340
Yeah. I can be sitting
in my bed,

31:34.342 --> 31:36.142
feel, like, a burn,

31:36.144 --> 31:39.579
and I'd go to the mirror,
and there'll be a scratch.

31:39.581 --> 31:43.617
I got a couple of pictures
she gave me.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.686
Is Casey doing this?

31:46.688 --> 31:49.756
No, it's somebody else.

31:53.094 --> 31:56.129
All right.
So, what else did you see?

31:56.131 --> 31:59.766
So, when I was downstairs
in the basement,

31:59.768 --> 32:05.304
I could see that there were
a lot of dead people,

32:05.306 --> 32:08.041
and they were trapped.

32:08.043 --> 32:11.444
So, I don't know when,
but at some point,

32:11.446 --> 32:13.713
somebody collected --

32:13.715 --> 32:18.184
somehow collected or captured
all these dead people.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.453
It's like a box, in a clear box,

32:20.455 --> 32:24.591
and I can see these dead people
are wanting out.

32:24.593 --> 32:27.260
Now, Matt, you've had a weird
thing going on in the basement.

32:27.262 --> 32:29.328
Yeah.
When I'm going up the stairs,

32:29.330 --> 32:32.666
I feel like I'm, like, getting
pulled back down the stairs.

32:32.668 --> 32:34.000
I don't know what it is.

32:34.002 --> 32:37.537
Now, is that caused by
the dead people downstairs?

32:37.539 --> 32:39.606
Yeah.

32:39.608 --> 32:45.212
I had a sketch done
of what I saw in the basement.

32:51.286 --> 32:52.919
It's pretty creepy.

32:54.623 --> 32:56.289
Holy crap.

32:56.291 --> 32:59.158
I hate that room.

32:59.160 --> 33:01.895
I've always hated
that room.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.631
It feels like
it's a crowded room,

33:04.633 --> 33:06.699
and I thought I was nuts.

33:06.701 --> 33:10.704
I get that feeling, too --
kind of a creeped-out vibe.

33:10.706 --> 33:13.039
Honestly, I'm just kind of
shook right now.

33:16.178 --> 33:20.713
When I went outside,

33:20.715 --> 33:24.584
I encountered
four different women,

33:24.586 --> 33:27.520
and they had
each been murdered.

33:27.522 --> 33:29.122
They were all white.

33:29.124 --> 33:35.661
They all seemed to be
between the ages of 20 and 35.

33:35.663 --> 33:38.998
They were killed by
a stalker

33:39.000 --> 33:42.268
in a very similar manner.

33:42.270 --> 33:45.671
They were all raped
and murdered and dumped,

33:45.673 --> 33:49.943
and all of this happened
over a span

33:49.945 --> 33:53.212
of approximately 10 years.

33:53.214 --> 33:54.681
When I saw these women,

33:54.683 --> 33:56.683
they were coming
out of the ground

33:56.685 --> 33:59.151
to come into the house.

33:59.153 --> 34:00.953
A lot of things she's talking
about reminds me of a guy

34:00.955 --> 34:02.989
I came across in my research.

34:02.991 --> 34:04.757
His name was Jake Bird.

34:04.759 --> 34:07.827
I've got a photo of him
right here.

34:07.829 --> 34:10.163
Now, if Jake did
half of what he claimed,

34:10.165 --> 34:12.899
he was probably one of the most
prolific serial killers

34:12.900 --> 34:14.501
in U.S. history.

34:14.503 --> 34:18.103
He was active in this
neighborhood back in the 1940s.

34:18.106 --> 34:22.375
On June 24, 1942, he murdered a
35-year-old spinster

34:22.377 --> 34:25.779
named Alta Fulkerson
right down the road from here.

34:25.781 --> 34:28.648
Holy ****.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.318
I got a picture
of her here.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.585
Now, Bird's M.O. was exactly
what you described.

34:33.588 --> 34:37.123
He raped Fulkerson,
dragged her out of the house,

34:37.125 --> 34:39.458
and bashed her head in
with a rock.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.726
Now, to try to get out of
the death penalty,

34:41.728 --> 34:44.130
Bird started confessing
to all these other crimes.

34:44.132 --> 34:46.998
Now, he claimed to have killed
44 people.

34:47.001 --> 34:49.268
Cops were able to confirm
12 of them,

34:49.270 --> 34:52.138
including Alta's murder.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.340
Now, here's the crazy part
about the story.

34:54.342 --> 34:58.211
Before Bird went to the gallows,
he put a curse on the people

34:58.213 --> 35:00.613
that were involved
in his conviction.

35:00.615 --> 35:02.749
He said all the people
who were involved in it

35:02.751 --> 35:04.884
would die before he did.

35:04.886 --> 35:07.487
Now, believe it or not,
within two months,

35:07.489 --> 35:11.691
four of the officials
he put the hex on died,

35:11.693 --> 35:13.026
including the prosecutor,

35:13.028 --> 35:15.361
the lieutenant who got
his confession, and the judge.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.963
Holy ****.

35:16.965 --> 35:19.432
All of these guys died
of a heart attack.

35:19.434 --> 35:23.169
Now, is it possible the women
you saw were Bird's victims?

35:23.171 --> 35:25.238
Well, yeah.

35:27.775 --> 35:30.777
Now, you said these women were
trying to get into the house.

35:30.779 --> 35:33.079
Any reason why they would want
to get in the house?

35:33.081 --> 35:36.982
Basically, there's a sensitive
in the house.

35:36.984 --> 35:38.984
That's why they're coming

35:38.986 --> 35:43.122
and trying to communicate.

35:43.124 --> 35:45.424
It could come in dreams,

35:45.426 --> 35:47.994
making connections
with these deceased people.

35:47.996 --> 35:52.398
Well, let's talk
about your dreams.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.201
I see a lot
of horrible things.

35:55.203 --> 35:58.671
I've seen, like, murders.

35:58.673 --> 36:02.675
You had some really horrific
dreams involving your kids.

36:02.677 --> 36:04.877
Yeah, I get really bad
nightmares about them.

36:04.879 --> 36:07.747
I've seen them...

36:07.749 --> 36:10.350
I've seen them drowned.
I've seen them stabbed.

36:10.352 --> 36:12.285
I've seen them
kill themselves.

36:12.287 --> 36:15.821
And...

36:15.823 --> 36:17.424
they're the most important
thing in my life,

36:17.426 --> 36:20.226
and it's just been
torture.

36:20.228 --> 36:21.494
Well, it's a silly question,

36:21.496 --> 36:23.630
but is Michelle possibly
the sensitive

36:23.632 --> 36:25.097
you're talking about?

36:25.099 --> 36:26.966
Yeah.

36:29.971 --> 36:32.171
Am I bringing people
to me?

36:32.173 --> 36:36.175
Yeah, that's kind of
how it goes, you know.

36:36.177 --> 36:37.177
So, like,
you're like this thing

36:37.179 --> 36:39.712
that they can see
and help them.

36:39.714 --> 36:42.315
Okay.
Or that they can
**** with,

36:42.317 --> 36:46.252
especially
when you fit this type.

36:46.254 --> 36:48.921
So you're talking about you
think Jake Bird might be here.

36:48.923 --> 36:50.890
Yes.

36:50.892 --> 36:57.530
I feel like he's the one
who is tormenting you.

36:57.532 --> 36:59.399
The sexual attacks
that she's having --

36:59.401 --> 37:00.933
is that Bird?

37:00.935 --> 37:02.602
Yeah.

37:02.604 --> 37:08.408
So, I would think that
he would torture you,

37:08.410 --> 37:11.211
molest you
until he gets bored,

37:11.213 --> 37:16.082
and then would probably more
than likely try to kill you.

37:16.084 --> 37:17.950
Scary, you know.

37:17.952 --> 37:21.221
Part of me just doesn't
want to believe it.

37:21.223 --> 37:24.290
I'm also concerned about
what I saw him doing

37:24.292 --> 37:26.959
in a child's bedroom
upstairs.

37:26.961 --> 37:29.496
I believe it was the room
to the left.

37:29.498 --> 37:31.030
Evelyn's room.

37:31.032 --> 37:34.500
I walked in there,
and I just felt <i> horrible,</i>

37:34.502 --> 37:37.704
and I got that the living child
was getting sick --

37:37.706 --> 37:41.107
stomach issues
as well as exhaustion.

37:41.109 --> 37:44.110
She gets hit with a draft
and, you know,

37:44.112 --> 37:47.247
high fever
or vomiting all the time.

37:47.249 --> 37:52.418
And her getting sick --
is that because of him?

37:52.420 --> 37:53.786
Yes.

37:56.724 --> 38:00.927
So, I'm watching all of this,
and then I saw a male,

38:00.929 --> 38:03.796
and he was
falling to his knees

38:03.798 --> 38:06.399
and praying
at the side of the bed,

38:06.401 --> 38:10.737
and I see the male, like,
transform into this,

38:10.739 --> 38:13.606
like, monster.

38:13.608 --> 38:19.612
This monster could become
abusive toward the living.

38:20.881 --> 38:23.215
So what exactly does
this monster look like?

38:23.217 --> 38:24.951
I had a sketch done.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.068
Holy ****.

38:43.638 --> 38:46.905
I'm, like, so angry.
I'm, like, shaking.

38:46.907 --> 38:50.909
I'm very worried about
anyone being here at all.

39:20.574 --> 39:23.108
So, Michelle, Matt,
you guys got

39:23.110 --> 39:25.511
a hell of a lot
of information tonight,

39:25.513 --> 39:27.446
and I know it wasn't
easy to hear.

39:27.448 --> 39:30.716
The good news is,
you're not crazy,

39:30.718 --> 39:33.251
and now we know
what's been causing you

39:33.253 --> 39:35.654
and your kids
to live in hell here.

39:35.656 --> 39:38.523
What we don't know yet is
whether or not you can fix it

39:38.525 --> 39:40.592
so that you guys can get
your life back together

39:40.594 --> 39:43.595
and raise your kids here
in a normal manner.

39:43.597 --> 39:46.064
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:48.802 --> 39:52.470
So, the first thing
that I would like

39:52.472 --> 39:56.475
for you to deal with
would be him.

39:56.477 --> 40:02.481
This needs to be done via
a voodoo priest or priestess.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.751
What they're going to do
is suck him up

40:05.753 --> 40:09.354
and take him with them.

40:09.356 --> 40:12.958
So, the second thing
that needs to be done

40:12.960 --> 40:17.429
is a male medium between
the ages of 20 and 30 years old

40:17.431 --> 40:21.032
and specifically
gentle in nature --

40:21.034 --> 40:25.170
he needs to come here
and talk to Casey.

40:25.172 --> 40:27.639
Now, what they're going to
try to do

40:27.641 --> 40:34.380
is connect with other people
that Casey has lost

40:34.382 --> 40:37.015
to come and retrieve him

40:37.017 --> 40:42.587
and then try to guide him
over with them.

40:42.589 --> 40:44.923
The third thing that
I would like you to do

40:44.925 --> 40:50.662
is to connect with
a psychic who's a female

40:50.664 --> 40:53.398
and have her come in
and move on the dead

40:53.400 --> 40:55.868
who are trapped
in the basement.

40:55.870 --> 40:57.736
Now, what about the guy
praying over the bed

40:57.738 --> 40:59.938
who turns into a monster?

40:59.940 --> 41:01.874
That's an aspect
of the killer.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.509
It will go with him.

41:05.946 --> 41:10.482
I can't wait to destroy
this dude.

41:12.820 --> 41:14.819
So, the ultimate question is,

41:14.821 --> 41:19.090
are you gonna listen to what
Amy tells you you got to do?

41:19.092 --> 41:21.359
Hands down.

41:21.361 --> 41:22.761
What about you?

41:22.763 --> 41:26.098
Yeah, 100% down to do

41:26.100 --> 41:29.701
everything
that she suggested.

41:29.703 --> 41:33.171
This is a pretty good scenario
as far as a fix.

41:33.173 --> 41:34.973
It gives me <i> so</i> much hope,

41:34.975 --> 41:37.375
so much more confidence
moving forward.

41:37.377 --> 41:41.713
So grateful for you guys,
absolutely.

41:41.715 --> 41:43.448
So grateful.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.655
I really hope
Michelle and Matt

41:49.657 --> 41:51.990
follow all of my advice.

41:51.992 --> 41:55.861
If they do, they'll be able to
live peacefully in their house,

41:55.863 --> 41:58.797
and most importantly,
so will their children.

42:02.936 --> 42:04.669
We just wanted to
give you guys an update

42:04.671 --> 42:05.938
on all of our progress.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.739
We followed all of
Amy's advice,

42:07.741 --> 42:10.141
and all of the negative activity
in the house

42:10.143 --> 42:12.544
has come to a complete stop.

42:12.546 --> 42:14.813
We had a voodoo priest
and his team come out.

42:14.815 --> 42:16.748
They performed
a pretty amazing ceremony.

42:16.750 --> 42:19.217
Evelyn hasn't been sick once
in the last two months.

42:19.219 --> 42:20.619
Before, it felt like
we were walking into

42:20.621 --> 42:23.955
somebody else's house,
and now it feels like our home.

42:23.957 --> 42:25.624
Thank you guys so much.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.793
We would not be where we are
right now without you.
