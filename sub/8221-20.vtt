WEBVTT

00:00.781 --> 00:02.078
Please don't try anything

00:02.149 --> 00:04.174
that you're about to see us do
at home.

00:04.251 --> 00:05.616
Ever!

00:07.554 --> 00:09.579
NARRATOR: On this episode
of "Mythbusters,"

00:09.656 --> 00:12.124
it's all about you, the viewers.

00:12.192 --> 00:13.818
TORY: This ought to clean out
the pipes.

00:13.894 --> 00:14.724
[Cheering]

00:14.795 --> 00:17.263
NARRATOR:
We take four fan-fueled fables

00:17.331 --> 00:19.993
and apply the blowtorch
of science.

00:20.067 --> 00:21.694
TORY:
Run! It's gonna explode!

00:22.836 --> 00:25.100
NARRATOR: First,
can the fastest-growing plant

00:25.172 --> 00:27.640
on the planet
penetrate a person?

00:27.708 --> 00:31.075
[French accent] Jamie is
imagining himself to be a plant.

00:31.144 --> 00:33.044
NARRATOR:
And will brandy bring you back

00:33.113 --> 00:35.172
from the brink of hypothermia?

00:35.248 --> 00:37.079
I'm going into a delirium.
[Babbles]

00:37.150 --> 00:39.948
NARRATOR: Then, if you mix
alkali metals and water,

00:40.020 --> 00:41.783
will it blow up your bathtub?

00:41.855 --> 00:43.618
[Laughter]

00:43.690 --> 00:46.557
And finally,
will burning a baby grand

00:46.626 --> 00:48.924
- really cause it to explode?
- TORY: Go, go, go, go!

00:48.995 --> 00:52.658
NARRATOR: So, sit back,
drink up, and count backwards...

00:52.733 --> 00:54.462
3, 2, 1!

00:54.534 --> 00:57.867
NARRATOR: Because we're back
to test more of your myths.

00:57.938 --> 00:59.530
[Cheering]

01:02.409 --> 01:04.775
Who are the Mythbusters?

01:05.912 --> 01:07.777
- Adam Savage...
- Hey! Ow!

01:07.848 --> 01:09.440
We will need to bring
some more power.

01:09.516 --> 01:10.778
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:10.851 --> 01:12.978
I'm not so sure
this is a good idea.

01:13.053 --> 01:15.112
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years

01:15.188 --> 01:17.019
of special-effects experience.

01:17.090 --> 01:18.955
Oh!

01:19.025 --> 01:21.721
NARRATOR:
Joining them... Kari Byron...

01:21.795 --> 01:24.127
Whose hair-ball idea is this?

01:24.197 --> 01:26.256
- NARRATOR: Grant lmahara...
- Hwacha!

01:26.333 --> 01:27.857
NARRATOR:
...and Tory Belleci.

01:27.934 --> 01:29.561
This is gonna be a great day!

01:29.636 --> 01:31.194
NARRATOR: They don't just tell
the myths...

01:31.271 --> 01:32.397
If you say so, Junior.

01:32.472 --> 01:35.236
NARRATOR:
...they put them to the test.

01:48.588 --> 01:50.317
JAMIE: If you've got a myth
for us to test,

01:50.390 --> 01:51.482
we'd love to hear about it.

01:51.558 --> 01:53.788
Here, off the icy waters
of San Francisco Bay,

01:53.860 --> 01:55.987
we have a very rare
opportunity...

01:56.062 --> 01:59.088
to be able to view
a very elusive television host

01:59.166 --> 02:01.634
in his natural habitat...
the Hyneman.

02:01.701 --> 02:04.761
Latin name...
Hoosierus televisualus.

02:04.838 --> 02:07.534
And he seems to be communicating
with his viewers,

02:07.607 --> 02:09.734
asking them for ideas.

02:09.810 --> 02:10.834
And who knew?

02:10.911 --> 02:13.004
Not only did you respond
to the call,

02:13.079 --> 02:16.640
you opened the floodgates
and sent us a gazillion myths.

02:16.716 --> 02:19.310
So we selected
a few of the best to test.

02:19.386 --> 02:20.683
What's up first?

02:20.754 --> 02:21.778
Bamboo torture.

02:26.827 --> 02:29.489
- [Breathing heavily]
- You had enough yet?

02:29.563 --> 02:31.895
'Cause I can keep singing
all day long.

02:31.965 --> 02:33.762
I can take
whatever you can throw at me.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.769
JAMIE: All right, then.
Well, how about that, wise guy?

02:36.837 --> 02:38.429
A tiny bamboo plant?

02:38.505 --> 02:40.132
What are you gonna do to me
with that?

02:40.207 --> 02:42.835
I'm gonna plant it and then
grow it right through you.

02:42.909 --> 02:44.433
Really?
Does that work?

02:44.511 --> 02:45.739
I don't know,
but that's the myth,

02:45.812 --> 02:48.645
and I've always
wanted to try it.

02:48.715 --> 02:50.740
NARRATOR:
It's a far-fetched fable

02:50.817 --> 02:52.375
straight from the fan site.

02:52.452 --> 02:54.181
During World War I I,

02:54.254 --> 02:57.951
captured POWs
were supposedly stretched above

02:58.024 --> 03:02.927
and then penetrated by
fast-growing bamboo shoots.

03:02.996 --> 03:04.930
Aah!

03:05.932 --> 03:07.593
So, what's your plan
for this one?

03:07.667 --> 03:09.157
It's pretty straightforward,
I think.

03:09.236 --> 03:11.363
We get some kind
of a human analogue.

03:11.438 --> 03:13.235
We get some fast-growing bamboo,

03:13.306 --> 03:15.536
and we plant the bamboo
under the analogue

03:15.609 --> 03:16.940
and see if it grows through it.

03:17.010 --> 03:18.875
Right. Normally,
I'd say we should use pig.

03:18.945 --> 03:21.072
But given the fact that
this is gonna take a few days,

03:21.147 --> 03:23.012
it's gonna get way too smelly.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.914
Well, I tell you what...
Why don't we measure

03:24.985 --> 03:26.919
how much force it takes
to penetrate pig flesh

03:26.987 --> 03:30.946
and then we create a synthetic
simulant that won't rot?

03:31.024 --> 03:32.582
And then put the bamboo
underneath that.

03:32.659 --> 03:35.150
- Exactly.
- [Gong clangs]

03:35.228 --> 03:36.957
[Eastern music plays]

03:37.030 --> 03:41.967
NARRATOR: And so
crouching Savage, hidden Hyneman

03:42.035 --> 03:44.435
begin their long
and arduous search

03:44.504 --> 03:46.699
for the legendary
torture technique

03:46.773 --> 03:48.968
in the mystical
bamboo groves of...

03:49.943 --> 03:51.001
...Santa Cruz?

03:51.077 --> 03:53.170
Luckily enough,
we live in California,

03:53.246 --> 03:55.441
where bamboo grows beautifully.

03:55.515 --> 03:56.573
NARRATOR:
And the purveyor

03:56.650 --> 03:59.050
of these potentially
penetrating plants...

03:59.119 --> 04:01.144
[Chuckles]
That's the thing right there.

04:01.221 --> 04:02.245
That'll get you talking.

04:02.322 --> 04:03.846
NARRATOR:
...is Larry Gullman.

04:03.924 --> 04:05.152
JAMIE:
Is a bamboo shoot

04:05.225 --> 04:08.251
physically capable of pushing
its way through human flesh?

04:08.328 --> 04:11.320
Bamboo shoots in the ground
have to push through the dirt,

04:11.398 --> 04:13.491
around rocks,
through rotten logs.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.000
I've seen bamboo shoots push up
walkway pavers.

04:16.069 --> 04:18.935
So yes, they do push very hard
when they're in the ground.

04:19.005 --> 04:20.563
If you're strapped down
to this...

04:20.640 --> 04:23.268
Oh, I can already feel it.
[Laughs]

04:23.343 --> 04:25.436
So the early signs
are promising.

04:25.512 --> 04:26.604
JAMIE:
That's what we want.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.375
ADAM: And that's due
to the unusual way

04:28.448 --> 04:30.348
in which bamboo grows.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.978
The canes shoot out from
an underground root system.

04:34.054 --> 04:35.988
And while underground,
the shoot tips

04:36.056 --> 04:38.422
are extremely tough and sharp

04:38.491 --> 04:40.857
in order to push out
through the soil.

04:40.927 --> 04:43.361
So the question is,
do they have enough force

04:43.430 --> 04:45.694
to push through a human body?

04:45.765 --> 04:47.733
Let's say somebody owed you
money.

04:47.801 --> 04:50.065
What kind of bamboo
would you use?

04:50.136 --> 04:51.967
I think you should use
Spectabilis.

04:52.038 --> 04:53.062
It's shooting right now.

04:53.139 --> 04:54.834
It's about an inch in diameter
and very sharp.

04:54.908 --> 04:56.307
NARRATOR: Perfect.

04:56.376 --> 04:59.368
With their potentially
penetrating plants purchased,

04:59.446 --> 05:00.879
there's only one thing left
to do.

05:00.947 --> 05:02.039
Well, we've got our bamboo.

05:02.115 --> 05:05.050
It's time to go back to the shop
and torture some dummies.

05:07.754 --> 05:10.279
Okay, so what's our next myth
for the viewer special?

05:10.357 --> 05:12.325
We're doing a myth about metal,
and not just any metal,

05:12.392 --> 05:14.917
but my second favorite metal...
alkali metal.

05:14.995 --> 05:16.428
You mean like rubidium
and cesium.

05:16.496 --> 05:17.428
Exactly.

05:17.497 --> 05:18.987
There's this Internet video
floating around

05:19.065 --> 05:21.329
where these guys throw cesium
and rubidium into a bathtub,

05:21.401 --> 05:24.063
and they liken the explosion
to a hand grenade.

05:24.137 --> 05:25.536
Fans want to know
if that's actually true.

05:25.605 --> 05:26.572
Okay, that's cool.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.200
But instead of bathtubs,
why don't we do toilets?

05:29.275 --> 05:32.176
Like we used to flush the cherry
bombs down in high school.

05:32.245 --> 05:33.371
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

05:33.446 --> 05:34.879
I was too busy
studying chemistry,

05:34.948 --> 05:37.849
but if you want to do that,
by all means, let's do it.

05:37.917 --> 05:39.817
What is this, Opposite Land?

05:39.886 --> 05:42.719
NARRATOR: Hand grenades
and explosions, you say?

05:43.523 --> 05:46.981
Well, that can only mean a trip
to the team's dream location...

05:47.060 --> 05:50.496
the Alameda County Sheriff's
bomb disposal range.

05:50.563 --> 05:52.360
GRANT:
What are we blowing up today?

05:52.432 --> 05:54.229
TORY:
Toilets, bathtubs.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.961
KARI:
Everything but the kitchen sink.

05:56.036 --> 05:56.968
NARRATOR:
And the reason

05:57.037 --> 05:59.164
the bathroom furniture
is on death row

05:59.239 --> 06:00.797
is the fan furor

06:00.874 --> 06:05.004
over a video clip that looks
a little bit like this.

06:05.078 --> 06:07.273
Anybody got anything to read?

06:07.881 --> 06:09.109
NARRATOR:
After demonstrating

06:09.182 --> 06:12.379
that the reaction between water
and the alkali metals

06:12.452 --> 06:16.252
becomes more violent as you
move down the periodic table,

06:16.322 --> 06:18.290
they get to rubidium.

06:18.358 --> 06:20.952
And with what looks to be
about 2 grams,

06:21.027 --> 06:25.464
they claim to get
a hand-grenade-sized explosion.

06:25.532 --> 06:29.559
So to find out
if this is film fakery or fact,

06:29.636 --> 06:31.536
we're going to need a control.

06:31.604 --> 06:33.128
TORY:
Now, on the Internet video,

06:33.206 --> 06:36.698
they said the reaction was equal
to a hand-grenade explosion.

06:36.776 --> 06:38.334
This ought to clean out
the pipes.

06:38.411 --> 06:40.345
So we need to see
what that looks like

06:40.413 --> 06:42.313
in order to have something
to compare with.

06:42.382 --> 06:44.873
How great is this?
We get to start off with a bang.

06:44.951 --> 06:46.851
We're gonna blow the crap
out of that toilet!

06:46.920 --> 06:48.478
- Get it?
- NARRATOR: Uh, sure.

06:48.555 --> 06:51.683
But Grant and not Tory
will explain

06:51.758 --> 06:56.354
how the team are going to
safely explode the commode.

06:56.429 --> 06:58.488
This is a grenade.

06:58.565 --> 07:00.226
But it's not a live grenade.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.700
In a live grenade,
you'd have TNT in here.

07:02.769 --> 07:04.964
You pull the pin,
the clip pops off,

07:05.038 --> 07:07.063
and this is what would set off
the explosion.

07:07.140 --> 07:10.632
But what we're gonna do today
is fill this with enough C-4

07:10.710 --> 07:13.873
to have the equivalent
blasting power of the TNT.

07:13.947 --> 07:16.745
Then we're gonna set it off
with a blasting cap.

07:16.816 --> 07:19.444
That way, we can control
exactly when it goes off,

07:19.519 --> 07:22.454
and it will be much, much safer.

07:22.522 --> 07:23.955
NARRATOR:
Fire in the bowl!

07:24.023 --> 07:27.686
TORY:
3, 2, 1!

07:27.761 --> 07:30.355
GRANT: Whoa!

07:30.430 --> 07:31.727
The toilet's gone.

07:31.798 --> 07:33.629
NARRATOR:
Yep. Now you see it.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.531
Now you don't.

07:41.441 --> 07:44.308
TORY:
Oh, we blowed it up real good.

07:44.377 --> 07:45.366
GRANT:
That's nice.

07:45.445 --> 07:46.844
[Laughter]

07:46.913 --> 07:48.778
All that's left
is the water tank.

07:48.848 --> 07:51.612
- The bowl just shattered.
- TORY: Yeah.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.481
We destroyed this toilet,
and now I know

07:53.553 --> 07:55.544
what a real grenade looks like
when it goes off.

07:55.622 --> 07:57.453
So now we've got
a great reference

07:57.524 --> 07:59.253
for what it should look like

07:59.325 --> 08:03.455
when we put our alkali metals
in a toilet, in water.

08:06.332 --> 08:09.096
NARRATOR: Used in waterwheels
and weapons...

08:09.169 --> 08:10.033
Aah!

08:10.103 --> 08:12.663
NARRATOR: Construction
and the culinary arts...

08:12.739 --> 08:14.832
as a raw material,

08:14.908 --> 08:18.366
bamboo's versatility
is virtually limitless.

08:18.444 --> 08:19.376
MAN:
In the Philippines,

08:19.445 --> 08:22.710
they call this
the Dance of the Bamboo Pole.

08:22.782 --> 08:23.942
NARRATOR:
But fans want to know

08:24.017 --> 08:26.645
if this flexible,
fast-growing grass

08:26.719 --> 08:30.485
could have been used
as an instrument of torture.

08:30.557 --> 08:32.525
Aah!

08:33.893 --> 08:34.985
NARRATOR:
And to find out,

08:35.061 --> 08:39.121
Adam and Jamie need
a human guinea pig to pierce.

08:39.198 --> 08:42.191
But which one?
Hmm...

08:42.268 --> 08:43.530
The whole point of this test

08:43.602 --> 08:45.571
is to come up
with a human analogue.

08:45.638 --> 08:48.436
We've done this on the show
but usually with ballistics.

08:49.609 --> 08:51.975
[Lisping] I don't see
any subcutaneous damage here.

08:52.045 --> 08:54.639
[Normal voice] And this is
a very well-explored field.

08:54.714 --> 08:56.841
Not the slow penetration

08:56.916 --> 08:59.248
of something sharp
like a bamboo plant.

08:59.319 --> 09:00.718
Nobody's done a lot
of figuring on that,

09:00.787 --> 09:01.913
so we have to do it ourselves.

09:01.988 --> 09:04.183
We've got to go to the butcher,
get a big slab of meat...

09:04.257 --> 09:05.588
[Laughs]

09:05.658 --> 09:08.218
...start pushing spikes into it,
come up with readings.

09:08.294 --> 09:09.488
And when we get those readings

09:09.562 --> 09:12.053
as to how much pressure and
resistance the meat provides...

09:12.131 --> 09:13.393
[Chuckles]

09:13.466 --> 09:16.435
...we've got to imitate it
with synthetic materials.

09:16.502 --> 09:18.197
NARRATOR:
Yep, to make a fake torso

09:18.271 --> 09:20.398
with accurate
flesh-like resistance

09:20.473 --> 09:22.065
to a growing bamboo shoot...

09:22.141 --> 09:24.632
This has got to be the most
gruesome thing I've ever made.

09:24.711 --> 09:25.871
NARRATOR:
...the guys need to know

09:25.945 --> 09:28.379
exactly what that resistance is.

09:28.448 --> 09:29.540
Ah...

09:29.616 --> 09:32.744
[French accent] In pushing
through the meat very slowly,

09:32.819 --> 09:36.880
Jamie is imagining himself
to be a plant.

09:36.956 --> 09:37.980
JAMIE:
What's our peak?

09:38.057 --> 09:39.354
[Normal voice]
8 max.

09:39.425 --> 09:41.120
NARRATOR:
Several tests later,

09:41.194 --> 09:43.492
and the guys have
a decent sample range...

09:43.563 --> 09:44.928
ADAM:
9.5 total.

09:44.998 --> 09:47.796
NARRATOR: And decide to
round up for simplicity's sake.

09:47.867 --> 09:49.835
Well, 10 pounds seems to be
the magic number

09:49.903 --> 09:51.461
with this spike
in penetrating flesh.

09:51.537 --> 09:54.563
So all we got to do is find
a mix of materials around here

09:54.641 --> 09:57.303
that makes a flesh
that doesn't rot and stink.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.313
Our ballistic material.

10:01.381 --> 10:02.814
I think it's perfect.

10:02.882 --> 10:05.112
Let me see what the needle says.

10:05.184 --> 10:06.651
- 10 pounds.
- ADAM: Wow.

10:06.719 --> 10:09.017
That is close enough
for my money. I love that.

10:09.088 --> 10:11.488
- NARRATOR: Next...
- Hello.

10:11.557 --> 10:14.287
NARRATOR: The guys whip up
a rooftop greenhouse...

10:14.928 --> 10:17.658
...and then assemble it,
unsurprisingly...

10:17.730 --> 10:20.528
- Rise, my son!
- NARRATOR: On the rooftop.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.261
Dude, touchdown!
Going in.

10:22.335 --> 10:24.997
JAMIE: This may look nice
and sunny, and it is,

10:25.071 --> 10:28.006
but it's also a torture chamber,
or it will be soon.

10:28.675 --> 10:31.109
NARRATOR: So that's
the greenhouse and bamboo

10:31.177 --> 10:35.011
in position, which leaves
just one component.

10:36.616 --> 10:38.277
Oh, you're mine now.

10:38.351 --> 10:40.444
NARRATOR: And the torso
is carefully positioned

10:40.520 --> 10:41.612
above several shoots

10:41.688 --> 10:44.521
that have yet to fully break
through the soil's surface.

10:45.892 --> 10:47.154
ADAM:
This version of Buster

10:47.226 --> 10:49.456
is our final stage of testing
in the bamboo.

10:49.529 --> 10:51.554
Will it grow through a person?

10:51.631 --> 10:54.657
After experimenting with a bunch
of different flesh analogues...

10:54.734 --> 10:56.759
Those are the two growth points.
They're beautiful.

10:56.836 --> 10:58.736
...this ballistics material,
which is non-water-based...

10:58.805 --> 11:01.035
it won't rot...
is the perfect material

11:01.107 --> 11:02.540
in terms of the amount
of pressure it takes

11:02.608 --> 11:04.235
to push through.

11:04.310 --> 11:07.768
So that if the bamboo grows
through this chest,

11:07.847 --> 11:09.109
we can definitively state

11:09.182 --> 11:11.207
that it would grow through you
as well.

11:12.352 --> 11:13.114
Is that it?

11:13.186 --> 11:14.312
- That ought to do it.
- All right.

11:14.387 --> 11:15.319
Well, let's get out of here

11:15.388 --> 11:17.219
and come back in a couple days
and see how it did.

11:17.290 --> 11:20.418
JAMIE: The way I see it, if
the bamboo shoot works its way

11:20.493 --> 11:22.620
two or three inches
into the back of the dummy,

11:22.695 --> 11:25.323
then it's an effective means
of torture.

11:25.398 --> 11:26.729
All we've got to do is wait.

11:29.235 --> 11:30.827
NARRATOR:
Kari, Grant, and Tory

11:30.903 --> 11:34.031
are taking on
an alkali-metal myth.

11:34.540 --> 11:36.371
A video on the Internet claims

11:36.442 --> 11:40.435
that if you add 2 grams
of rubidium or cesium to water,

11:40.513 --> 11:43.573
it'll blow up
your bathroom furniture...

11:43.649 --> 11:46.618
with a hand-grenade-sized
explosion.

11:46.686 --> 11:48.210
This ought to clean out
the pipes.

11:48.287 --> 11:50.346
NARRATOR: To find out
if it's actually true,

11:50.423 --> 11:52.084
we're doing a direct comparison.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.922
This is the hand grenade.

11:55.661 --> 11:57.686
Bring on the alkali metals.

11:57.764 --> 12:00.028
But first,
here's the science-y bit.

12:00.099 --> 12:01.259
This is cesium.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.665
And this is rubidium.

12:02.735 --> 12:04.726
And they're part
of a special class of elements

12:04.804 --> 12:06.135
called alkali metals.

12:06.205 --> 12:09.538
Now, what makes them special
is they have one electron.

12:09.609 --> 12:13.602
Now, normally, what they want to
do is react with other things

12:13.679 --> 12:15.306
and give up that electron.

12:15.381 --> 12:19.317
Now, what happens when the
alkali metals react with water

12:19.385 --> 12:20.977
is they release a lot of heat,

12:21.054 --> 12:24.512
and the other by-product
is hydrogen gas.

12:24.590 --> 12:27.491
And the heat tends to ignite
the hydrogen gas.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.255
It's a perfect storm

12:29.328 --> 12:32.058
of something that causes
an explosion.

12:32.131 --> 12:34.691
NARRATOR: And to put
these highly reactive metals

12:34.767 --> 12:36.462
in contact with water safely,

12:36.536 --> 12:39.596
the team has a couple
of safety precautions lined up.

12:39.672 --> 12:41.572
Pretty simple.
It's a little guillotine.

12:41.641 --> 12:44.906
The weight drops down
onto small glass vials

12:44.977 --> 12:46.069
which are holding the metals,

12:46.145 --> 12:48.170
releasing it into the toilet,
and we'll see what happens.

12:49.515 --> 12:52.109
TORY: In the video,
they said used 2 grams

12:52.185 --> 12:54.346
and they got an explosion
the size of a hand grenade.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.320
Now, we're gonna use 25 grams.

12:56.389 --> 12:58.118
That's more than
10 times the amount.

12:58.191 --> 12:59.488
So if it's true
what they're saying,

12:59.559 --> 13:01.993
we're gonna have
a huge explosion.

13:02.061 --> 13:03.858
Mayor of Rubidium Town.
Ready?

13:03.930 --> 13:05.022
- TORY: Yep.
- GRANT: Yep.

13:05.098 --> 13:08.795
3, 2, 1.

13:09.402 --> 13:11.302
- TORY: Whoa!
- GRANT: Whoa!

13:11.370 --> 13:12.667
TORY:
That was quick!

13:12.738 --> 13:14.000
Look at that cloud.

13:14.073 --> 13:16.166
NARRATOR: Well, it all went
according to plan.

13:16.242 --> 13:19.473
The string was cut,
and the guillotine fell.

13:19.545 --> 13:22.070
The rubidium was released
into the water,

13:22.148 --> 13:24.878
and cue the chemistry.

13:25.485 --> 13:28.579
The sudden release
of hydrogen gas and heat

13:28.654 --> 13:33.023
combines to give us
a satisfying toilet-bowl geyser.

13:33.092 --> 13:35.890
NARRATOR: But... and here's
the key... it was nothing

13:35.962 --> 13:39.728
like the Internet video
hand-grenade-sized explosion.

13:39.799 --> 13:41.960
Well, we may not have had
hand grenades,

13:42.034 --> 13:44.059
but at least we still have
good chemistry.

13:44.137 --> 13:45.968
NARRATOR:
But we haven't given up yet.

13:46.038 --> 13:49.906
Next up in an attempt
to blow up the bowl is cesium.

13:49.976 --> 13:51.967
GRANT: So this is it.
This is cesium.

13:52.044 --> 13:54.638
This is the most reactive
alkali metal

13:54.714 --> 13:58.241
that we can get our hands on
that's not radioactive.

13:58.317 --> 14:00.444
We're gonna put this
in the toilet bowl

14:00.520 --> 14:03.819
and see if it behaves
when exposed to water,

14:03.890 --> 14:05.084
like a grenade.

14:05.158 --> 14:06.648
Okay.

14:06.726 --> 14:10.389
In 3, 2, 1!

14:11.230 --> 14:14.063
- [All groan]
- Cool.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.101
There was a bit more reaction,
more popping,

14:16.169 --> 14:18.228
but it was just
a big cloud of gas again.

14:18.304 --> 14:20.397
NARRATOR:
More energy, more flame,

14:20.473 --> 14:23.101
but definitely no explosion.

14:23.176 --> 14:25.644
TORY: Now, I feel
like I've been lied to,

14:25.711 --> 14:28.908
because what I saw on that
Internet video was an explosion.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.347
What I saw here
was a cloud of smoke.

14:31.417 --> 14:33.044
Now, a cloud of smoke

14:33.119 --> 14:36.680
is not gonna destroy a toilet
like a hand grenade would.

14:36.756 --> 14:38.690
NARRATOR:
So, Kari, what does that mean?

14:38.758 --> 14:41.192
Which means they faked it,
and this is busted.

14:48.901 --> 14:51.062
NARRATOR: The Mythbusters
are no strangers

14:51.137 --> 14:53.105
to tall tales of torture.

14:53.172 --> 14:55.265
After all,
they've already confirmed

14:55.341 --> 14:58.970
that Chinese water torture
can send you 'round the bend.

14:59.045 --> 15:01.843
[Voice breaking] I don't
want to do this test right now.

15:01.914 --> 15:03.814
NARRATOR:
But now, at your behest,

15:03.883 --> 15:05.976
they're testing
the power of botany

15:06.052 --> 15:07.883
to bring you to the brink.

15:07.954 --> 15:10.354
And with
the ballistics-material dummy

15:10.423 --> 15:13.358
suspended above
the soon-to-shoot bamboo,

15:13.426 --> 15:15.656
the clock is ticking.

15:16.329 --> 15:17.796
JAMIE:
I'd imagine that torture

15:17.863 --> 15:20.024
is a pretty results-driven
business.

15:20.099 --> 15:22.260
And so we're looking
for a couple of things here.

15:22.335 --> 15:24.530
We're looking
as to whether the shoot

15:24.604 --> 15:27.937
can actually grow through
this flesh simulant

15:28.007 --> 15:30.635
and also how much time it takes
for it to do that.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.234
And they're both
really important.

15:32.311 --> 15:34.711
Because if it takes
months to do it,

15:34.780 --> 15:38.341
it's not really
an effective means of torture.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.282
If it does it
in a couple of hours

15:40.353 --> 15:42.617
or a couple of days, though...

15:42.688 --> 15:45.714
that starts to put it
in the realm of possibility.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.351
NARRATOR: And Jamie's prediction
is spot-on.

15:48.427 --> 15:50.156
Because after just three days,

15:50.229 --> 15:53.892
our tortured torso
is surely ready to talk.

15:53.966 --> 15:55.092
ADAM: Dude!

15:55.167 --> 15:58.728
The bamboo is growing
into our poor dude.

15:58.804 --> 16:02.069
The experiment
could not be going better.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.736
We have already gotten exactly
what we came looking for,

16:05.811 --> 16:08.803
which is at the point
at which bamboo meets flesh,

16:08.881 --> 16:11.941
does it make a left-hand turn
or does it just keep on going?

16:12.018 --> 16:14.782
And it's pretty clear
that it just keeps on going.

16:14.854 --> 16:16.822
Well, you know, I said earlier

16:16.889 --> 16:19.585
that if there was
any penetration at all,

16:19.659 --> 16:21.183
then that's torture.

16:21.260 --> 16:22.887
So I say this myth is...

16:22.962 --> 16:25.487
Ho!
Let's not call it just yet.

16:25.564 --> 16:27.191
I want to see
how far we can take it.

16:27.266 --> 16:28.858
Let's let it keep on growing.

16:28.934 --> 16:31.061
- Okay.
- [Chuckles]

16:31.137 --> 16:34.265
NARRATOR: But over two weeks
later, the news isn't good.

16:34.340 --> 16:37.741
Despite several other shoots
making their way into the dummy,

16:37.810 --> 16:43.077
Adam's wish to see complete
penetration comes to naught.

16:43.149 --> 16:44.275
ADAM:
Look at that.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.784
They haven't grown an inch
in two weeks.

16:46.852 --> 16:48.012
Those things are dead.

16:48.087 --> 16:51.488
Yeah, and look at that.
The ballistics gel is melted.

16:51.557 --> 16:54.993
It must have got so hot in here.
That's what killed him.

16:55.795 --> 16:58.525
We did prove that you could
torture somebody with bamboo,

16:58.597 --> 16:59.689
if you were determined.

16:59.765 --> 17:01.562
Yeah, but we didn't see
the bamboo grow

17:01.634 --> 17:03.295
all the way through the guy.

17:03.369 --> 17:06.065
I mean, that was supposed to be
the grand finale.

17:06.137 --> 17:07.570
You know,
we've got one more dummy.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.403
Let's chuck it up there
and see what happens.

17:09.474 --> 17:10.305
Okay.

17:10.376 --> 17:13.310
NARRATOR: So a second
ballistics-material torso...

17:13.378 --> 17:16.371
this time with attractive wig
and facial features...

17:16.449 --> 17:17.939
is taken to the roof,

17:18.017 --> 17:20.884
where the team has set up
a second growing area...

17:20.953 --> 17:23.012
one that's open to the elements.

17:23.089 --> 17:25.421
ADAM: Our dude is set up,
and this is our last chance

17:25.491 --> 17:26.924
to see bamboo
grow through a person.

17:26.992 --> 17:28.016
It's our last mannequin.

17:28.094 --> 17:30.358
It's our last
viable bamboo shoot,

17:30.429 --> 17:32.624
and it's pretty much
the end of the growing season.

17:32.698 --> 17:35.724
So if it's gonna happen,
it's got to happen here.

17:37.303 --> 17:38.668
NARRATOR:
And what do you know?

17:38.738 --> 17:41.263
Adam's desperation
is well rewarded.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.331
Fast-forward a couple of weeks,

17:43.409 --> 17:47.846
and this time, the results are
nothing short of astounding.

17:49.648 --> 17:51.639
JAMIE: That's what I'd call
a through and through.

17:51.717 --> 17:53.241
[Laughs]

17:53.319 --> 17:55.116
We wanted to know
if the bamboo would grow

17:55.187 --> 17:56.279
all the way through you.

17:56.355 --> 18:00.451
It turns out, not only will it,
but it actually thrives!

18:00.526 --> 18:02.858
This is 12 feet of bamboo,

18:02.928 --> 18:04.327
and it's going
right through this guy's chest.

18:04.397 --> 18:06.661
It doesn't get any more
definitive than that.

18:06.732 --> 18:09.166
I feel like someone's almost
playing an April Fools' joke.

18:09.235 --> 18:10.668
That's so perfect.

18:10.736 --> 18:12.829
JAMIE: Obviously, bamboo
can grow right through you,

18:12.905 --> 18:14.031
like it did over here,

18:14.106 --> 18:16.802
but for this to be a reasonable
method of torture...

18:16.876 --> 18:20.277
if you can consider torture
reasonable in any sense...

18:20.346 --> 18:22.576
it needs to do it
fairly quickly.

18:22.648 --> 18:26.277
And our time lapse shows
that this penetrated that body

18:26.352 --> 18:29.219
in a matter
of a couple of days or so.

18:29.288 --> 18:31.415
It's possible,
as gruesome as it is.

18:31.490 --> 18:32.821
ADAM:
That is awesome!

18:32.892 --> 18:35.383
Plausible!
And awesome.

18:35.461 --> 18:36.291
Plausible.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.767
Imagine yourself
on the frozen Arctic tundra.

18:44.837 --> 18:45.963
Your sled dogs
have abandoned you,

18:46.038 --> 18:48.836
you've run out of equipment and
food, and slowly you are dying,

18:48.908 --> 18:51.638
your life ebbing away,
minute by minute.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.439
Yeah, okay.
I remember that.

18:53.512 --> 18:56.709
And then, through tear-soaked
eyes, you see relief...

18:56.782 --> 19:00.013
salvation on the horizon
in the form of a Saint Bernard

19:00.085 --> 19:02.883
trotting towards you
with a barrel around his neck.

19:02.955 --> 19:04.650
That barrel is full of brandy.

19:04.723 --> 19:06.714
You take a couple of snorts
of that brandy.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.192
It warms you up
just enough to keep you alive

19:09.261 --> 19:11.058
until the rescue team arrives.

19:11.130 --> 19:13.690
Or this is like an aperitif
before I eat the dog.

19:13.766 --> 19:15.791
You can't say that.

19:16.535 --> 19:18.935
MAN: This brave lifesaver
is a one-man...

19:19.004 --> 19:21.802
or rather a one-dog...
rescue squad.

19:21.874 --> 19:24.001
In fact, that cask
around his neck

19:24.076 --> 19:27.671
is full of brandy that he's
taking to some lost traveler.

19:28.314 --> 19:31.875
NARRATOR: The Saint Bernard and
its barrel of lifesaving brandy

19:31.951 --> 19:36.547
is a famously warm-and-fuzzy
fable that you want answered.

19:37.389 --> 19:41.223
Will the arrival of a keg
on legs really keep you alive?

19:41.293 --> 19:43.693
Or is it...
you knew this was coming...

19:43.762 --> 19:45.559
just a shaggy-dog story?

19:45.631 --> 19:48.464
I've actually heard that
alcohol has the opposite affect

19:48.534 --> 19:50.968
and it cools you down,
not warms you up.

19:51.036 --> 19:53.163
That's strange, because I swear

19:53.239 --> 19:55.400
it has a warming effect
when I drink it.

19:55.474 --> 19:57.305
Should be pretty straightforward
to try.

19:57.376 --> 19:59.207
I think so.
I think all we need to do

19:59.278 --> 20:00.836
is find ourselves
a nice, big freezer,

20:00.913 --> 20:03.074
a way of monitoring
our body temperature,

20:03.148 --> 20:04.809
drink a few shots
of the hard stuff,

20:04.884 --> 20:06.476
and see what kind of change
occurs.

20:06.552 --> 20:07.541
Works for me.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.178
My ears are starting to sting.

20:09.255 --> 20:12.281
NARRATOR: But before the guys
get to test this frosty fable

20:12.358 --> 20:14.349
- in the freezer...
- I'm going into a delirium

20:14.426 --> 20:16.519
of thinking about what I'll do
once I'm warm.

20:16.595 --> 20:17.619
[Chuckles]

20:17.696 --> 20:19.755
NARRATOR:
...Adam's ensuring accurate info

20:19.832 --> 20:21.959
by ingesting a thermometer.

20:22.034 --> 20:23.968
Since this whole test is about

20:24.036 --> 20:26.402
whether or not there's any
change in our body temperature

20:26.472 --> 20:28.463
from the drinking
of the alcohol,

20:28.541 --> 20:31.533
we need to know exactly
what our body temperature is.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.202
And this isn't a thermometer
under the tongue

20:33.279 --> 20:35.076
or one in the ear
or one on the skin.

20:35.147 --> 20:37.547
We need our core
body temperature measured.

20:37.616 --> 20:38.878
We've done this
on the show before

20:38.951 --> 20:41.044
back when I got painted
with gold paint

20:41.120 --> 20:42.951
and I had a rectal thermometer.

20:43.022 --> 20:44.887
Oh, Sanjay.

20:44.957 --> 20:47.551
Sanjay, will you respect me
tomorrow?

20:47.626 --> 20:48.786
[Laughter]

20:48.861 --> 20:51.659
- [Pop]
- Oh! [Laughs]

20:52.231 --> 20:53.960
Neither of us want to do that
this time.

20:54.033 --> 20:56.501
So we're bringing in
a brand-new piece of technology

20:56.569 --> 20:59.197
called a core-body-temperature
capsule.

20:59.271 --> 21:01.102
Here we go.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.467
[Chuckles]

21:04.076 --> 21:06.840
It's basically a passive radial.

21:06.912 --> 21:08.209
It goes into our stomach,

21:08.280 --> 21:10.248
keeps track
of our core body temperature,

21:10.316 --> 21:12.511
and we check in on it with this.

21:12.585 --> 21:14.280
We hold this up to our bodies,
and boop!

21:14.353 --> 21:16.082
It tells us what
our core body temperature is.

21:16.155 --> 21:18.487
And couple days later,
we pass it.

21:18.557 --> 21:20.024
They're disposable!

21:20.092 --> 21:22.925
I ate a radio for science!

21:22.995 --> 21:24.292
NARRATOR:
But that super-accurate

21:24.363 --> 21:27.264
body-temperature thermometer
is not all they'll be using.

21:27.333 --> 21:30.598
The guys are going
for data overload.

21:30.669 --> 21:32.830
We're gonna be doing
some standardized tests

21:32.905 --> 21:34.634
at regular intervals
throughout the day.

21:34.707 --> 21:37.369
Now, the first one
is the core body temperature.

21:37.443 --> 21:39.502
Go ahead and swallow that puppy.

21:40.179 --> 21:42.443
- Mm.
- I know.

21:42.514 --> 21:43.640
JAMIE:
The second one is,

21:43.716 --> 21:46.549
we're gonna check in
on how we actually feel.

21:46.619 --> 21:49.144
On a coldness scale,
1 being the coldest

21:49.221 --> 21:52.554
and 10 being not cold at all,
where do you stand?

21:52.625 --> 21:54.024
- 8.
- 8.

21:54.093 --> 21:55.856
- You're just a little bit cold?
- Yeah.

21:55.928 --> 21:59.557
The third one is we're gonna be
using a thermal imaging camera

21:59.632 --> 22:03.534
to check our heat signatures
on the exterior of our bodies.

22:03.602 --> 22:04.830
Wow.
You look funny.

22:04.903 --> 22:07.201
[Laughs]
I can see you breathing.

22:07.272 --> 22:10.833
Basic temperature
of your left hand, 94. 1.

22:10.909 --> 22:13.036
NARRATOR:
And so, armed with their battery

22:13.112 --> 22:16.639
of data-gathering equipment
and a warm-weather baseline...

22:16.715 --> 22:19.809
JAMIE:
Tip of the nose, 96 degrees.

22:19.885 --> 22:22.547
NARRATOR: The boys are ready
for the big freeze.

22:22.621 --> 22:24.919
All right. Let's baseline.
Let's get cold.

22:28.894 --> 22:31.454
NARRATOR: Kari, Grant, and Tory
have already busted the myth

22:31.530 --> 22:34.624
that a few grams
of cesium or rubidium

22:34.700 --> 22:37.635
can cause a hand-grenade-sized
explosion.

22:37.703 --> 22:39.102
The Internet is lying again.

22:39.171 --> 22:40.502
NARRATOR:
So now it's time

22:40.572 --> 22:43.564
for the patented
"Mythbusters" ramping up.

22:43.642 --> 22:45.303
We're flushing the toilet.

22:45.377 --> 22:48.210
And to blow up the bathtub,
we're stretching the budget

22:48.280 --> 22:50.908
and moving into the realm
of ridiculous

22:50.983 --> 22:55.443
by using a massive
2.5 kilograms of sodium.

22:55.521 --> 22:56.647
TORY:
You ready to do this, Grant?

22:56.722 --> 22:57.711
GRANT:
I'm ready to do it.

22:57.790 --> 23:03.228
NARRATOR: And to accommodate
the 2.5 kilograms of sodium...

23:03.295 --> 23:04.159
TORY:
Let's run.

23:04.229 --> 23:07.164
NARRATOR: Kari has adapted
her guillotine.

23:07.232 --> 23:09.427
She's added a sledgehammer.

23:09.501 --> 23:12.561
Which means there's
only one thing left to do.

23:12.638 --> 23:14.162
Find out... for the fans...

23:14.239 --> 23:17.697
if supersizing the sodium
will blast the bathtub.

23:17.776 --> 23:19.937
TORY:
All right, this is sodium.

23:20.012 --> 23:23.038
In 3, 2, 1.

23:24.316 --> 23:25.476
- Oh!
- Oh!

23:25.551 --> 23:28.349
[Laughter]

23:28.420 --> 23:30.547
- TORY: Yeah!
- GRANT: Yeah!

23:30.622 --> 23:31.589
KARI:
Wait, wait, wait.

23:31.657 --> 23:33.716
Oh, my God.
Poisonous gas.

23:33.792 --> 23:37.159
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

23:37.229 --> 23:39.527
NARRATOR: Uh,
while the team holds its breath,

23:39.598 --> 23:41.759
let's check out the replay.

23:47.773 --> 23:48.535
[Laughter]

23:48.607 --> 23:50.973
That was incredible.

23:51.844 --> 23:55.678
NARRATOR: Yep, spectacular,
but it only caused a crack.

23:55.748 --> 23:57.841
The tub didn't disintegrate.

23:57.916 --> 24:00.180
So, how about taking it up
a notch?

24:00.252 --> 24:02.083
TORY:
It's like Christmas.

24:02.154 --> 24:03.451
GRANT:
That was amazing.

24:03.522 --> 24:07.049
But up next is potassium,
which is even more reactive,

24:07.126 --> 24:09.492
and, yep, same amount.

24:09.561 --> 24:12.587
NARRATOR: Uh-huh.
2.5 kilograms of potassium.

24:12.664 --> 24:14.188
GRANT:
Take it away.

24:14.266 --> 24:16.393
NARRATOR:
School-lab chemistry

24:16.468 --> 24:18.026
like you've never seen it
before.

24:18.103 --> 24:19.968
Okay. We're good.
Let's go.

24:20.038 --> 24:22.404
NARRATOR:
But will it provide the big boom

24:22.474 --> 24:25.068
we and you
have been waiting for?

24:25.144 --> 24:27.476
GRANT:
...2, 1!

24:29.314 --> 24:31.145
- Wow!
- Whoa!

24:31.216 --> 24:32.649
[Laughter]

24:32.718 --> 24:35.448
That was...
That was like fireworks.

24:36.889 --> 24:38.379
GRANT: Wow!

24:38.457 --> 24:41.688
KARI: Wow. That was
the Fourth of July in there.

24:42.661 --> 24:46.119
NARRATOR: Yes, once again, it's
an exciting chemical reaction,

24:46.198 --> 24:49.065
but it's still not
high explosives.

24:49.134 --> 24:51.193
[Laughter]

24:51.770 --> 24:53.362
So, in conclusion,

24:53.438 --> 24:58.034
you can use ridiculous amounts
of sodium and potassium.

24:58.110 --> 24:59.668
You can use
the more reactive elements

24:59.745 --> 25:01.406
in the alkali-metal family.

25:01.480 --> 25:04.881
But you won't get
a hand-grenade-sized explosion

25:04.950 --> 25:09.785
and blow up a bathtub
unless you use C-4, like this.

25:09.855 --> 25:14.189
All right, J. D.
In 3, 2, 1!

25:14.259 --> 25:15.692
[Cheering]

25:15.761 --> 25:16.853
Whoo! Nice!

25:16.929 --> 25:19.022
- TORY: Whoa!
- Yeah!

25:19.097 --> 25:21.395
Did you see how high
it shot that water?!

25:21.967 --> 25:25.459
NARRATOR: Yes, the shock wave
emanating from a C-4 detonation

25:25.537 --> 25:29.064
is approximately 8,000 meters
per second,

25:29.141 --> 25:33.202
which is in a different league
to alkali metals in water...

25:34.780 --> 25:37.408
...proving that
that Internet video

25:37.482 --> 25:40.508
is nothing but science fiction.

25:41.486 --> 25:44.011
Adam and Jamie
are about to chill out

25:44.089 --> 25:46.580
to find out
if a shot of brandy...

25:46.658 --> 25:47.750
Good boy.

25:47.826 --> 25:50.659
NARRATOR: Will actually
stave off hypothermia.

25:50.729 --> 25:53.562
- [Dog barks]
- Or is it simply a furry fable?

25:53.632 --> 25:56.533
Since we always want to be
authentic on "Mythbusters,"

25:56.602 --> 25:58.729
Bob here, a Saint Bernard,

25:58.804 --> 26:01.136
is going to be delivering
the brandy to us.

26:01.206 --> 26:03.140
Isn't that right, Bob?

26:03.208 --> 26:06.200
ADAM: We are at the very perfect
place to test this myth...

26:06.278 --> 26:08.542
a company called
Dean's Services.

26:08.614 --> 26:11.947
And they've got
125,000 square feet

26:12.017 --> 26:14.417
of freezer-cold rooms
at 0 degrees Fahrenheit,

26:14.486 --> 26:17.250
which is the temperature
we're gonna be working at.

26:17.322 --> 26:19.222
NARRATOR:
Remember, Adam and Jamie,

26:19.291 --> 26:21.486
with their
core-body-temperature capsules

26:21.560 --> 26:23.391
already in their stomachs...

26:23.462 --> 26:25.225
- JAMIE: It's cold.
- ADAM: I know!

26:25.297 --> 26:27.458
NARRATOR: Are literally
walking thermometers.

26:27.532 --> 26:30.524
But they'll also be monitoring
their mood

26:30.602 --> 26:32.433
as well
as the surface temperature

26:32.504 --> 26:34.335
of their extremities.

26:34.406 --> 26:36.601
It's weird having a job
where our only task today

26:36.675 --> 26:39.007
is to get cold and then drunk.

26:39.077 --> 26:42.638
NARRATOR: Yep, stage 1 of the
test is to simulate a situation

26:42.714 --> 26:45.046
in which the guys
will need rescuing

26:45.117 --> 26:47.483
by a brandy-carrying
Saint Bernard.

26:47.552 --> 26:49.213
I'm starting to get
uncomfortable.

26:49.288 --> 26:52.655
NARRATOR: And that means
getting very cold very fast.

26:52.724 --> 26:57.661
Right now, I don't feel so bad,
but it's changing rapidly.

26:57.729 --> 26:58.696
NARRATOR:
Stage 2.

26:58.764 --> 27:00.629
Once they've
completely chilled out...

27:00.699 --> 27:02.166
Ooh, calamari.

27:02.234 --> 27:03.701
Get the brandy off of him.

27:03.769 --> 27:04.531
[Clink]

27:04.603 --> 27:06.662
NARRATOR:
...the drinking commences.

27:06.738 --> 27:07.500
[Laughs]

27:07.572 --> 27:09.665
NARRATOR: But just 10 minutes
into the test

27:09.741 --> 27:12.733
and the guys get the first piece
of relevant information,

27:12.811 --> 27:14.779
and it's not what you'd expect.

27:14.846 --> 27:16.643
My temperature
has been steadily going up.

27:16.715 --> 27:19.980
It's now at 98.56.
What does yours say?

27:20.052 --> 27:22.680
Yeah, I'm going up, too.
I'm at 98.9.

27:22.754 --> 27:24.312
I haven't read up on this,

27:24.389 --> 27:28.189
but the fact that my internal
body temperature is rising

27:28.260 --> 27:30.956
while I'm feeling
like I'm getting colder

27:31.029 --> 27:35.227
says to me something like my
vascular system is clamping down

27:35.300 --> 27:39.031
on my extremities
and keeping the heat inside.

27:39.104 --> 27:42.073
ADAM: Check out the big brain
on Jamie!

27:42.140 --> 27:45.234
Because he's nailed
one of the key responses

27:45.310 --> 27:48.575
of all endothermic animals
to the cold.

27:48.647 --> 27:50.945
The superficial
blood vessels constrict,

27:51.016 --> 27:53.041
preventing heat loss
through the skin

27:53.118 --> 27:56.884
and directing blood
to critical internal organs.

27:56.955 --> 28:00.516
NARRATOR: With such amazing
evolutionary adaptations,

28:00.592 --> 28:03.584
it could take a while
before the guys need rescuing.

28:03.662 --> 28:07.689
So to hurry things along, they
decide on some drastic action.

28:07.766 --> 28:10.633
I don't think we're getting
cold enough fast enough.

28:10.702 --> 28:13.933
I think we should take off
our hats and unzip our coats.

28:16.074 --> 28:21.102
Subjective testing...
coldness scale, 1 to 10?

28:21.179 --> 28:24.444
Mm, I'm saying
I'm at least about a 2.

28:24.516 --> 28:26.711
ADAM: Yeah, I agree
with that assessment.

28:26.785 --> 28:28.650
Uh, extremities?

28:28.720 --> 28:29.982
Extremities are painful.

28:30.055 --> 28:33.081
My hands are hurting,
my head especially.

28:33.158 --> 28:35.092
NARRATOR:
And the thermal camera,

28:35.160 --> 28:37.253
as well as providing Adam
with entertainment...

28:37.329 --> 28:38.819
ADAM:
[Laughs] Wow, man.

28:38.897 --> 28:40.387
I got to tell you,
with your hat off,

28:40.465 --> 28:42.660
you look like a Bond villain
in this shot.

28:42.734 --> 28:45.225
NARRATOR: Seems to confirm
Jamie's earlier theory.

28:45.303 --> 28:48.272
Despite their stable
core body temperature,

28:48.340 --> 28:52.572
their extremities have plummeted
by over 20 degrees.

28:52.644 --> 28:53.872
Oh, my fingers hurt.

28:53.945 --> 28:56.778
JAMIE:
Okay, your face is 65 degrees.

28:56.848 --> 28:58.338
NARRATOR:
With the numbers noted,

28:58.417 --> 29:00.044
there's just one thing left
to do.

29:00.118 --> 29:02.643
- My ears are starting to sting.
- Yeah.

29:02.721 --> 29:04.814
JAMIE:
Help me, Bob. I'm freezing.

29:08.693 --> 29:11.685
[Piano plays ragtime music]

29:12.564 --> 29:13.588
[Gasps]

29:13.665 --> 29:16.634
We've got a really weird myth
for the viewer special.

29:16.701 --> 29:19.829
Have you ever heard that
a piano can explode in a fire?

29:19.905 --> 29:21.964
No, I have not,
but it does make sense,

29:22.040 --> 29:24.133
because the strings
are under a lot of tension.

29:24.209 --> 29:25.301
Who cares if it makes sense?

29:25.377 --> 29:27.902
We might get to see
a piano explode.

29:28.947 --> 29:31.142
NARRATOR:
Ah, the humble piano.

29:31.216 --> 29:33.912
Tickle its ivories,
and you get beautiful music.

29:33.985 --> 29:37.785
But in a fire, could it turn
from innocent keyboard

29:37.856 --> 29:40.950
into an instrument
of mass destruction?

29:42.761 --> 29:44.388
Well, it sounds
pretty straightforward.

29:44.463 --> 29:45.691
All we need to do
is get a piano,

29:45.764 --> 29:47.698
build a fire under it,
and see if it explodes.

29:47.766 --> 29:48.698
Well, hang on.

29:48.767 --> 29:49.927
I think before we do that,

29:50.001 --> 29:52.401
we need to find out how much
tension the strings are under.

29:52.471 --> 29:54.496
Actually, I know
the perfect people for that.

29:55.774 --> 29:58.106
NARRATOR:
And that perfect piano place...

29:58.176 --> 30:00.076
GRANT:
Ready to get your tune on?

30:00.145 --> 30:04.707
NARRATOR: Is owned
by John Callahan, the piano man.

30:06.184 --> 30:08.049
KARI: So, the myth
that we're working on

30:08.120 --> 30:12.181
is that if you put a piano
in a fire, it will explode.

30:12.257 --> 30:15.693
Wow. I've actually heard people
talk about that before.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.352
Having never burned
a piano myself,

30:17.429 --> 30:18.657
I don't know if that's true.

30:18.730 --> 30:20.493
I'm not sure exactly
what's gonna happen.

30:20.565 --> 30:22.999
To me, it sounds
relatively plausible,

30:23.068 --> 30:27.004
because I understand there's
a lot of tension on the strings.

30:27.072 --> 30:29.097
CALLAHAN: Well, there sure is
a lot of tension on the stings.

30:29.174 --> 30:30.732
In a piano, the steel wire

30:30.809 --> 30:33.573
is stretched across
the cast-iron plate,

30:33.645 --> 30:38.378
and there's about 200 pounds of
tension on each wire, average.

30:38.450 --> 30:41.681
We have about 230 wires
in the piano.

30:41.753 --> 30:45.018
So there's a total
of over 20 tons of force

30:45.090 --> 30:46.352
trying to collapse the piano.

30:46.424 --> 30:48.358
NARRATOR:
Now, that sounds promising.

30:48.426 --> 30:51.554
The strings stretched
across the cast-iron plate

30:51.630 --> 30:54.531
hold 40,000 pounds of pressure.

30:54.599 --> 30:57.796
And if the flames cause them
to fail, hey, presto...

30:57.869 --> 31:00.360
exploding piano.

31:00.906 --> 31:02.237
KARI:
It's always a good day

31:02.307 --> 31:04.298
when you start it
at the bomb range.

31:04.376 --> 31:06.469
NARRATOR: Callahans
have kindly given the team

31:06.545 --> 31:08.445
a baby grand to ignite.

31:08.513 --> 31:09.980
Now all they have to do...

31:10.048 --> 31:11.606
[Sour chord plays]

31:11.683 --> 31:13.241
...is get it off the truck...

31:13.318 --> 31:14.842
Moving a piano sucks.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.217
NARRATOR:
...and into position.

31:16.288 --> 31:18.483
I'm just gonna do
a little tension music.

31:18.557 --> 31:21.890
NARRATOR: While Kari does some,
you know, actual work,

31:21.960 --> 31:27.125
Tory and Grant serenade her the
only way they know how... badly.

31:27.199 --> 31:30.896

31:30.969 --> 31:34.632
Grinding organ
all day and night

31:34.706 --> 31:37.231
NARRATOR: With the piano
standing on its own legs,

31:37.309 --> 31:40.335
there's just one thing
left to do... tune it.

31:40.412 --> 31:42.778
All right, John, I know that
tuning a piano at a bomb range

31:42.847 --> 31:45.748
is probably a pretty strange
working condition for you.

31:45.817 --> 31:47.250
But we need to give this myth

31:47.319 --> 31:49.287
the best possible chance
of working.

31:49.354 --> 31:52.414
We need to get each one of these
strings at the proper tension.

31:52.490 --> 31:53.889
I'll do my best.

31:53.959 --> 31:57.451
NARRATOR: And as John brings
the piano to perfect pitch,

31:57.529 --> 32:00.396
the guys pitch in
to build the bonfire.

32:00.465 --> 32:02.865
GRANT: So, to all
the piano aficionados out there,

32:02.934 --> 32:05.903
I just want to let you know,
we love pianos.

32:05.971 --> 32:07.495
Not enjoying this in the least.

32:07.572 --> 32:10.132
Light it on fire

32:10.208 --> 32:12.369
Light it on fire

32:12.444 --> 32:13.877
Okay, just a little bit.

32:13.945 --> 32:16.379
But this piano was destined
for the dump.

32:16.448 --> 32:17.938
It's not salvageable.

32:18.016 --> 32:20.450
Unfortunately,
it's beyond repair,

32:20.518 --> 32:22.509
so somebody had to do it.

32:22.587 --> 32:23.986
Might as well be us.

32:24.055 --> 32:27.183
NARRATOR: So it's this
baby grand's finale.

32:27.259 --> 32:29.727
But will the meltdown
be a letdown?

32:29.794 --> 32:31.159
TORY:
Run! It's gonna explode!

32:31.229 --> 32:34.426
NARRATOR: Or will it be
a musical mushroom cloud?

32:34.499 --> 32:36.364
TORY:
Piano is definitely on fire.

32:36.434 --> 32:38.265

Hey, that is a nice fire.

32:40.639 --> 32:43.631

are chillin' out... literally.

- My ears are starting to sting.
- Yeah.

32:46.444 --> 32:47.308
[Barks]

32:47.379 --> 32:50.109
NARRATOR: And at the limit
of their cold-weather endurance,

32:50.181 --> 32:52.012
they need rescuing.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.516
ADAM:
Get the brandy off of him.

32:53.585 --> 32:56.145
NARRATOR: But is
the mythical shot of brandy

32:56.221 --> 32:57.984
- the right way to go?
- ADAM: There we go.

32:58.056 --> 32:59.751
Cheers.

33:03.895 --> 33:05.385
It's good brandy.

33:05.463 --> 33:08.762
NARRATOR: The immediate signs,
at least on a subjective level,

33:08.833 --> 33:10.095
seem to back up the myth.

33:10.168 --> 33:12.363
Yeah, the brandy sort of helped
a little bit.

33:12.437 --> 33:15.600
There's definitely a feeling,
a distinct feeling,

33:15.674 --> 33:18.905
of a warm glow
happening down here.

33:18.977 --> 33:20.342
NARRATOR:
A few minutes after downing

33:20.412 --> 33:23.176
the supposedly lifesaving shots,

33:23.248 --> 33:25.739
the guys rustle up
another set of data.

33:25.817 --> 33:28.479
And although their body
temperature remains stable...

33:28.553 --> 33:30.748
I'm 99. 15.

33:30.822 --> 33:32.346
Mine's 98.6.

33:32.424 --> 33:34.358
NARRATOR: The numbers
for skin temperature

33:34.426 --> 33:35.450
are very interesting.

33:35.527 --> 33:38.758
JAMIE:
Face is 74 degrees.

33:38.830 --> 33:41.128
NARRATOR: Which is an increase
of 9 degrees

33:41.199 --> 33:43.064
from their pre-brandy
temperatures.

33:43.134 --> 33:46.035
Again, the science backs up
the numbers.

33:46.104 --> 33:49.335
Alcohol does in fact dilate
your blood vessels,

33:49.407 --> 33:53.969
leading to flush cheeks and
more blood flow to your skin.

33:54.045 --> 33:56.946
And to find out if this effect
is really helping

33:57.015 --> 33:58.710
- fight off the cold...
- Cheers.

33:58.783 --> 34:02.617
NARRATOR: Another shot
is called for and duly drunk.

34:04.556 --> 34:06.217
[Spits]
I got a hair.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.225
NARRATOR: And once again,
the immediate signs

34:08.293 --> 34:12.161
are that the alcohol has
a positive subjective effect.

34:12.230 --> 34:15.597
ADAM: I'm picturing big,
steaming pans of warm food

34:15.667 --> 34:18.226
and dunking my hands into them.

34:18.303 --> 34:19.702
[Laughs]

34:19.771 --> 34:20.965
I'm going into a delirium

34:21.039 --> 34:23.303
of thinking about what I'll do
once I'm warm.

34:23.375 --> 34:24.842
[Laughs]

34:24.909 --> 34:27.969
NARRATOR: But assuming this is
a life-or-death situation,

34:28.045 --> 34:31.880
maybe improving your mood
isn't a priority.

34:32.417 --> 34:35.386
I can already tell that my
mental faculties are impaired.

34:35.453 --> 34:37.148
[Laughs]
What were we supposed to do?

34:37.222 --> 34:39.713
Left hand. Oh, I'm getting them
wrong, aren't I?

34:39.791 --> 34:40.688
[Laughs]

34:40.759 --> 34:44.627
I don't think, just
from a subjective point of view,

34:44.696 --> 34:47.358
that I'd want to further impair
them with alcohol,

34:47.431 --> 34:51.300
although caring less about the
cold certainly has its merits.

34:51.369 --> 34:52.666
JAMIE:
Yeah, you might do better

34:52.737 --> 34:56.935
by trying to light a small fire
or something like that.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.202
Get shelter.

34:58.276 --> 34:59.903
NARRATOR:
And with that pearl of wisdom,

34:59.978 --> 35:02.310
it's time to gather
the last set of data.

35:02.380 --> 35:05.110
Okay, face... 72 degrees.

35:05.183 --> 35:06.673
NARRATOR:
Again, the thermal camera

35:06.751 --> 35:08.548
shows the guys' skin temperature

35:08.620 --> 35:12.317
to be higher than
or equal to pre-brandy numbers.

35:12.390 --> 35:14.620
ADAM: [Laughs]
Dude, I just can't get over

35:14.692 --> 35:16.751
how funny-looking you look
on the thermal camera.

35:16.828 --> 35:19.023
NARRATOR: But critically,
the same can't be said

35:19.097 --> 35:20.655
for their core body temperature.

35:20.732 --> 35:23.633
97.37.

35:23.701 --> 35:27.296
NARRATOR: Which is a sudden and
worrying drop of a whole degree.

35:27.372 --> 35:31.433
Although by this point, Adam's
having too much fun to care.

35:31.509 --> 35:33.636
In a few minutes,
I feel like the creature

35:33.711 --> 35:36.373
that's running the Jamie engine
is gonna [Babbles]

35:36.448 --> 35:38.882
And run away
'cause it's too cold.

35:38.950 --> 35:40.474
It's got to find a warmer host.

35:40.552 --> 35:42.179
NARRATOR:
And with that last observation,

35:42.253 --> 35:46.713
it's time to pull the plug, get
warm, and draw some conclusions.

35:46.791 --> 35:49.487
- Can we go now?
- JAMIE: It turns out

35:49.561 --> 35:52.792
that Saint Bernards
carrying brandy is a myth.

35:52.864 --> 35:55.992
Now, If these guys
actually saved anybody's lives,

35:56.067 --> 35:58.160
it would be due
to their body warmth.

35:58.236 --> 36:00.534
'Cause like Bob here,
they're big brutes.

36:00.605 --> 36:03.039
They're really furry, and he's
actually keeping me quite warm.

36:03.107 --> 36:05.098
NARRATOR:
Yep, a shaggy-dog cuddle

36:05.176 --> 36:08.509
is the solution
to this shaggy-dog story.

36:09.247 --> 36:12.648
In summary, alcohol dilates
your vascular system,

36:12.717 --> 36:14.878
which sends blood
to your extremities,

36:14.953 --> 36:16.887
where it loses its warmth.

36:16.955 --> 36:20.914
And as a result, your core
body temperature quickly cools.

36:20.992 --> 36:23.893
You don't mind
if I have a little nip, huh?

36:24.395 --> 36:25.987
[Yelps, barks]

36:26.064 --> 36:28.225
I got to tell you,
right after that second brandy,

36:28.299 --> 36:30.767
I was thinking, "I understand
what this myth is all about,"

36:30.835 --> 36:32.496
'cause I was feeling
pretty fine.

36:32.570 --> 36:35.300
Probably 'cause you didn't care
about the cold so much anymore.

36:35.373 --> 36:37.807
Well, no, alcohol also has
a diluting effect.

36:37.876 --> 36:40.902
My blood was thinning and moving
more towards my extremities,

36:40.979 --> 36:42.276
making me feel more comfortable.

36:42.347 --> 36:44.338
But right after that,
your core body temperature

36:44.415 --> 36:45.939
started to drop like a stone.

36:46.017 --> 36:48.247
Right, which is
precisely the opposite

36:48.319 --> 36:51.152
of what you want to happen
in a freezing-cold situation.

36:51.222 --> 36:53.816
So in the short term,
it might make you feel good,

36:53.892 --> 36:56.952
but ultimately it's
the last thing you want to do.

36:57.028 --> 36:59.360
- Absolutely. This one's busted.
- Busted.

37:02.934 --> 37:07.496
NARRATOR: Kari, Grant, and Tory
love a good, explosive bonfire.

37:08.907 --> 37:10.636
So when viewers suggested

37:10.708 --> 37:13.768
that burning a baby grand
might make it explode...

37:13.845 --> 37:17.576
Kerosene

37:17.649 --> 37:18.741
[Piano plays softly]

37:18.816 --> 37:21.046
NARRATOR: They couldn't wait
to fire up...

37:21.119 --> 37:21.881
TORY: Run!

37:21.953 --> 37:23.580
NARRATOR:
...and find out if it was true.

37:23.655 --> 37:26.453
Oh, my God.
That fire's awesome!

37:28.359 --> 37:31.089
NARRATOR: Remember, if
there's any truth to this myth,

37:31.162 --> 37:33.722
the 20 tons of tension
in the strings

37:33.798 --> 37:37.131
has to be suddenly
and explosively released.

37:37.201 --> 37:38.668
KARI:
Seeing a little caving in.

37:38.736 --> 37:41.398
TORY: Maybe it will collapse
on itself.

37:41.472 --> 37:42.666
NARRATOR:
That's the theory.

37:42.740 --> 37:47.177
But as the baby grand slowly but
surely burns down to the ground,

37:47.245 --> 37:50.612
the myth of the exploding piano
goes up in smoke.

37:50.682 --> 37:52.411
GRANT:
Well, no explosion.

37:52.483 --> 37:54.849
In fact, all we see
that's left of the piano

37:54.919 --> 38:00.357
is a smoking hull with a
skeleton of the cast-iron piece.

38:00.425 --> 38:03.622
You can still see some strings,
which is not what I expected.

38:03.695 --> 38:05.162
I thought in all the heat,

38:05.229 --> 38:08.027
strings, which are very thin
compared to the cast iron,

38:08.099 --> 38:11.034
would have been going
bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!

38:11.102 --> 38:13.263
But we didn't hear anything.

38:13.338 --> 38:15.363
TORY: There's no way this thing
will ever explode.

38:15.440 --> 38:18.341
I'm so confident that that's
why I'm this close to the piano.

38:18.409 --> 38:21.276
No matter how much tension
is put on these wires,

38:21.346 --> 38:23.041
they're never gonna explode
and pop.

38:23.114 --> 38:25.241
Because as the wires heat up,

38:25.316 --> 38:27.011
the metal is just gonna expand.

38:27.085 --> 38:28.017
It's just gonna stretch.

38:28.086 --> 38:31.180
So you're never gonna get
the bing, boing, snapping wires,

38:31.255 --> 38:33.246
and you're not gonna get
the exploding piano.

38:33.324 --> 38:34.951
It's just
not physically possible.

38:35.026 --> 38:36.015
NARRATOR:
And that's the key.

38:36.094 --> 38:39.552
Yes, the tension will be
released, but it happens slowly,

38:39.631 --> 38:42.623
as the metal strings expand
in the fire.

38:42.700 --> 38:43.462
And so...

38:43.534 --> 38:45.058
KARI:
This is definitively busted.

38:45.136 --> 38:46.364
- Busted.
- Busted.

38:46.437 --> 38:47.369
NARRATOR:
But hold on.

38:47.438 --> 38:48.837
Aren't they forgetting
something?

38:48.906 --> 38:51.841
KARI: The myth that a piano
will explode in a fire

38:51.909 --> 38:53.570
is completely busted.

38:53.645 --> 38:56.079
But now we want to replicate
the results.

38:56.147 --> 38:57.944
So we're gonna blow a piano up
anyway.

38:58.016 --> 39:01.110
So, J. D., the regular piano
in the fire kind of sucked.

39:01.185 --> 39:02.209
Didn't explode.

39:02.286 --> 39:05.346
But we do have a backup piano
that we can explode.

39:05.423 --> 39:07.414
- What do you have for us?
- What I think you need

39:07.492 --> 39:10.256
is the "Mythbusters Concerto
in C-4."

39:10.328 --> 39:11.352
[Laughs]

39:11.429 --> 39:13.420
All right, J. D.,
this one's for you.

39:13.498 --> 39:14.624
Go, J. D.

39:14.699 --> 39:15.961
Go, J. D.

39:16.034 --> 39:18.696
Fill this piano
with some TNT

39:18.770 --> 39:20.135
Go, J. D.

39:20.204 --> 39:21.171
Go, J. D.

39:21.239 --> 39:22.297
Everybody, now!
Come on!

39:22.373 --> 39:23.567
Go, J. D.

39:23.641 --> 39:25.006
Go, J. D.

39:25.076 --> 39:27.670
Fill this piano
with some TNT

39:27.745 --> 39:31.203
NARRATOR: It's a catchy tune,
and J. D. Hums along

39:31.282 --> 39:36.049
as he tunes the piano for the
"Mythbusters Concerto in C-4."

39:36.120 --> 39:37.747
- All right. You guys ready?
- I'm ready.

39:37.822 --> 39:38.811
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

39:38.890 --> 39:42.485
This is it.
In 3, 2, 1.

39:42.560 --> 39:47.588
NARRATOR: Invented in Italy in
1698 by Bartolomeo Cristofori,

39:47.665 --> 39:50.463
brought to popularity
by Mozart and Beethoven

39:50.535 --> 39:51.934
in the 18th century,

39:52.003 --> 39:57.134
and now, 2008,
exploded by the Mythbusters.

39:57.208 --> 40:00.939
[Cheering]

40:01.012 --> 40:04.175
Now, that's what I call
an exploding piano!

40:04.248 --> 40:05.146
Nice!

40:16.027 --> 40:19.121
Man, one second it was there.
Next second it was gone.

40:20.965 --> 40:22.796
[Laughing]
Look. It's all over the place.

40:22.867 --> 40:24.801
NARRATOR: And because
it's the viewer special,

40:24.869 --> 40:28.305
especially for you,
here's the high-speed encore

40:28.372 --> 40:31.808
of the "Mythbusters Concerto
in C-4."

40:31.876 --> 40:34.674
[Slow music plays]

40:44.555 --> 40:46.352
Rest in pieces!

40:46.424 --> 40:48.688
We wrecked that piano.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.092
This is my '80s rock band.

40:51.162 --> 40:54.154
We all had these
and did this move.

40:54.966 --> 40:56.934
Now, that was cool,
but the myth is still busted.

40:57.001 --> 40:58.992
If your piano is on fire,
it's not gonna explode.

40:59.070 --> 41:01.971
If it's filled with C-4,
well, that's another story.

41:04.175 --> 41:05.642
Looks like this myth

41:05.710 --> 41:08.406
Of the exploding piano

41:08.479 --> 41:11.642
Is bust-e-ed
