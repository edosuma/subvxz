[door bell jingles]

00:14.884 --> 00:17.321
- Thank you.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.323
- You have any idea
how easy it is

00:19.367 --> 00:21.847
to burn your
fingers on baked goods?

00:21.891 --> 00:24.720
- No.
- It's very easy.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.591
- So, it's going well?
- It is not.

00:26.635 --> 00:29.159
I have baked goods
coming out of my ass.

00:29.203 --> 00:30.378
My jeans are tight.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.815
And Escano has said
two words to me.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.164
- What can I get you?

00:34.208 --> 00:36.427
- Just a iced coffee.

00:39.735 --> 00:41.563
She's sweet.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.304
- Hmm.

00:43.347 --> 00:46.611
- Look, I know I couldn't
go to the dude's bakery like,

00:46.655 --> 00:48.483
"Hey, buddy,
let me sell your drugs."

00:48.526 --> 00:51.094
But if I have
to upsell one more donut,

00:51.138 --> 00:53.053
I am going
to blow my brains out.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.229
- That's why we're here.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.708
- What do you mean?

00:56.752 --> 00:59.146
- It's been enough time.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.062
Escano shouldn't
be suspicious of you.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.368
It's time to build the case.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.327
- Enjoy.

01:08.024 --> 01:11.201
- What the hell does she
think I'm gonna do with this?

01:11.245 --> 01:13.856
Okay, yeah.
How do we do that?

01:13.899 --> 01:17.729
How do we build the case?

01:17.773 --> 01:19.731
- You get closer.

01:22.038 --> 01:26.564
Look, on the surface, Escano
runs a string of bakeries.

01:26.608 --> 01:30.002
We both know
he's also running Los Temidos.

01:30.046 --> 01:33.093
I mean, this man's running
a cartel-plugged DTO

01:33.136 --> 01:34.703
with 70 factions.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.835
He's dealing
mass amounts of dope

01:36.879 --> 01:38.794
and is responsible for
at least ten homicides

01:38.837 --> 01:41.013
that we know of.

01:41.057 --> 01:43.929
And yet, we've got zero
hooking him to any of it.

01:43.973 --> 01:45.757
Escano is smart.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.238
He keeps everyone
at a distance,

01:48.282 --> 01:50.588
keeps himself protected.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.982
I mean, all we've got
on him we could have found

01:53.025 --> 01:54.766
from a Google search.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.726
Wife died ten years ago,
been single since.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.249
No children.

01:59.293 --> 02:02.905
This man doesn't have friends,
no girlfriends.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.516
No one shows up at his home.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.651
Cheap sex is not going
to do it, not with this guy.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.350
We need something more.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.658
So that's what
you're gonna find.

02:19.051 --> 02:22.446
You find some way
to get close to him.

02:22.490 --> 02:25.101
And you treat it like
any other relationship,

02:25.145 --> 02:26.798
any other person.

02:28.409 --> 02:33.370
You get to know him,
let him know you.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.546
It'll take time.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.810
And that's fine. We've got it.

02:38.854 --> 02:43.815
You find whatever it is
that can bond you to Escano,

02:43.859 --> 02:48.603
something to tie you up
together, something real.

02:48.646 --> 02:52.998
So then when Escano needs
someone for Los Temidos...

02:53.042 --> 02:54.696
you're the person he wants.

02:54.739 --> 02:57.525
You're the one he's close to.

03:12.061 --> 03:15.543
- No Adrian or Cherry yet.
- Yeah, no Escano, either.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.941
- Come on, stupid thing.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.860
- I hate to say it, but Anna's
not making any progress.

03:28.904 --> 03:32.037
Escano practically
walked through her yesterday.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.735
- She'll figure it out.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.911
- On Tuesday
he called her Rebecca.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.265
You like her now?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.527
- No.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.703
- Yeah, you do,
you like her now.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.618
We should get Anna a name tag.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.577
Because if Escano calls
her Rebecca one more time--

03:49.620 --> 03:51.274

Try not to move, all right?

look at me. Are you hurt?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.049
- Please, I just
need to know if he's shot.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.355
- Are you hurt?
- Please, is he shot?

04:28.398 --> 04:30.748
- Hey, hey, how can I help?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.707
- You okay?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.317
- Yeah, um,
what do you want me to do?

04:34.361 --> 04:36.276
- I'm detective Hailey Upton,
come here.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.321
Stay with her, check her
for injuries--what's your name?

04:38.365 --> 04:40.715
- I'm Anna Avalos.
I work in the bakery.

04:40.758 --> 04:43.500
- Okay, stay with her,
keep her calm.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.197
All right, you're okay.

04:45.241 --> 04:46.851
- Is she okay?
- She's okay.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.157
- Is the baby okay?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.941
- Everyone's okay. All right,
try not to move.

04:49.985 --> 04:53.641
- I can't feel it.
I can't feel any of it.

04:56.818 --> 04:59.342
- Okay. Help's on the way,
okay?

04:59.386 --> 05:00.822
It's gonna be okay.

05:13.138 --> 05:15.402
- You good?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.360
What the hell happened?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.753
- We had to engage.
We had no choice.

05:18.796 --> 05:21.103
Jumped off right in front of us.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.539
- Okay.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.932
- The offender's in the wind.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.978
He was about 6 foot, 180,
masked, gloved up.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.067
I'm guessing
he had a car nearby.

05:29.111 --> 05:30.373
- Okay, you running PODS?

05:30.417 --> 05:31.635
- Yeah, we got PODS
and cams going already.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.984
- I shot him in his right side,

05:33.028 --> 05:35.073
so he's gonna
need medical attention.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.032
- The offender
had an intended target?

05:37.075 --> 05:40.209
- Yes, it was premeditated.
The offender was lying in wait.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.863
Victim's name is Joshua DeSoto.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.560
He's on his way to Med right now
with his girlfriend.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.040
She seems unharmed,

05:45.083 --> 05:47.695
but the bullet blew out
Joshua's spine.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.046
- Did we just burn
our entire case on Escano?

05:51.089 --> 05:54.571
- No, I don't think so.
Anna was the only one here.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.791
- She came outside to help?
- She did good though.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.880
Kept her cover.
No one else was inside.

05:58.923 --> 06:01.404
- Escano wasn't here.
I think we're good.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.067

let's make sure of that.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.901

06:33.523 --> 06:35.482

Halstead's watching the bakery.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.874
All right,
what do we got on our victim?

06:36.918 --> 06:39.181
- ID as Joshua DeSoto,
ex-banger,

06:39.224 --> 06:40.400
born and raised in Pilsen.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.966
Got out of Menard a year ago.

06:42.010 --> 06:43.490
He was hooked in with
the Latin Players,

06:43.533 --> 06:45.230
got a five-year bid
for possession.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.537
But it looks like he dropped
his flag in prison.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.452
Good behavior, early parole.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.888
Been living with
his girlfriend Emy

on that block today?

07:12.127 --> 07:13.911
Joshua died at Med.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.220
Okay, our aggravated battery

07:18.263 --> 07:20.265
just got upgraded to a homicide.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.180
Joshua didn't make it.

07:22.224 --> 07:24.226
All right, what do you got?

07:24.269 --> 07:25.793
- Not too much yet.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.491
It is looking like Joshua
wasn't affiliated anymore.

07:28.535 --> 07:29.927
Phone, social?

07:29.971 --> 07:31.407
Looks like he cut off
all contact

07:31.451 --> 07:33.104
with the old world
as soon as he got into prison.

07:33.148 --> 07:36.456
- And Sarge? We got
zero links to Escano.

07:36.499 --> 07:40.372
Shooter might not have anything
to do with him, or Los Temidos.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.462
- Just a stroke of bad faith?

07:43.811 --> 07:45.116
So what do we got
on the shooter?

07:45.160 --> 07:46.596
- We got nothing
on the shooter, Sarge.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.119
I mean, the guy
clearly had a car waiting,

07:48.163 --> 07:49.425
but we got no PODs.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.992

07:51.035 --> 07:52.515
Got word out
to all the hospitals.

07:52.559 --> 07:53.777

07:53.821 --> 07:55.213

07:55.257 --> 07:57.651
- All right, keep this quiet,
you understand?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.522
Anytime
you're out on the street,

07:59.566 --> 08:01.132
you say you were

08:01.176 --> 08:03.874
And change your vest plates,
no patches.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.876
I don't want to give
Escano any reason

08:05.920 --> 08:08.400
to know we got a case on him.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.272

to understand who Josh is.

How do you know that?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.873

he got out of prison and he...
