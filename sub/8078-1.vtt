06:49.010 --> 06:51.840
Sousuke, come right back!

06:51.840 --> 06:52.630
Okay.

08:33.360 --> 08:34.490
A goldfish...

08:47.670 --> 08:48.880
It's stuck.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.690
That was weird.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.240
Ow!

09:22.410 --> 09:23.950
Is it dead?

09:28.390 --> 09:30.040
It licked me... It's alive.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.220
Sousuke, we're leaving!

09:36.010 --> 09:39.140
Lisa, I caught a goldfish!

09:49.650 --> 09:51.230
This wind feels strange...

09:51.230 --> 09:54.030
Sousuke, I'm starting the car!

10:03.120 --> 10:04.290
Did you find her?

10:09.960 --> 10:13.000
What? Captured by a human?

10:16.130 --> 10:18.470
This is bad... Very bad.

10:44.950 --> 10:46.660
Are you dead?

10:54.750 --> 10:56.090
You're alive!

11:05.470 --> 11:09.520
Sousuke! I'm going to be late!

11:09.930 --> 11:13.060
Lisa! I caught a goldfish.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.770
A goldfish?

11:14.770 --> 11:16.940
Down by the rocks.

11:42.930 --> 11:46.300
I'm sorry, but you can't use weed killer here.

11:48.890 --> 11:54.850
Heavens, no! This is pure sea water. It keeps me humidified.

11:54.850 --> 11:56.940
As long as it's not weed killer.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.070
Good day!

12:07.370 --> 12:09.410
<i>This is very</i>

12:12.120 --> 12:13.960
What a creepy guy.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.290
<i>But don't youout strangers, Sousuke.</i>

12:17.290 --> 12:18.920
I won't.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.340
Are you taking that to school?

12:22.380 --> 12:23.930
Won't your teacher complain?

12:24.310 --> 12:28.140
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.640
She's cute!

12:36.480 --> 12:38.190
They're using the dry dock.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.320
Here, eat this before we get there.

12:43.650 --> 12:45.610
Maybe she's hungry.

12:46.490 --> 12:47.700
Want some?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.410
Hey, my cut is gone!

12:54.620 --> 12:57.250
Lisa, I'm going to call her Ponyo.

12:58.130 --> 13:01.210
She's really special! She can do magic.

13:01.800 --> 13:04.340
She fixed my cut.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.350
Want some ham?

13:31.660 --> 13:34.120
Lisa, Ponyo likes ham!

13:34.120 --> 13:35.620
That makes two of us.

13:59.140 --> 14:00.690
Oh, no...

14:03.480 --> 14:05.030
Disgusting!

14:05.030 --> 14:07.280
Hurry, Lisa-san!

14:15.990 --> 14:18.410
Such filth! Intolerable!

14:20.750 --> 14:22.380
Good morning!

14:28.840 --> 14:31.510
Look, Ponyo. There's our house.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.310
Morning.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.320
I'll drop you here.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.120
Okay.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.290
Have fun.

14:56.290 --> 14:57.870
See you.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.830
Morning. Sorry I'm late.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.370
Could you get Noriko-san's wheelchair?

15:02.370 --> 15:02.880
Yes.

15:18.270 --> 15:20.060
Good morning, Sou-chan.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.980
I'm busy, Yoshie-san. Talk to you later.

15:22.980 --> 15:24.360
My!

15:24.360 --> 15:25.940
Hello, Sousuke-chan.

15:25.940 --> 15:27.480
Can't talk now, Toki-san.

15:27.480 --> 15:28.400
Oh, my.

15:35.530 --> 15:38.040
Maybe the teacher will get mad.

15:39.750 --> 15:40.790
I know!

15:44.880 --> 15:47.710
Wait here. I'll be back soon.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.380
What if a cat comes?

16:03.020 --> 16:06.730
Stay here. I'll be right back.

16:14.070 --> 16:16.370
See you later. Oh, hi, Toshi-chan.

16:18.450 --> 16:22.080
It's all right. She'll be just fine.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.250
Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

16:24.790 --> 16:26.630
Good morning, Sensei.

16:26.630 --> 16:27.960
Hello, Sou-chan.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.250
How are you?

16:34.630 --> 16:36.010
Sousuke!

16:36.010 --> 16:36.930
Kumiko-chan...

16:36.930 --> 16:40.310
Like my dress? Mommy got it for me.

16:40.310 --> 16:41.600
Oh...

16:41.600 --> 16:43.430
Let's play, Sousuke!

16:43.430 --> 16:45.640
Not now. I'm busy.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.310
How come?

16:47.310 --> 16:49.230
I told you, I'm busy.

16:49.230 --> 16:51.030
You're no fun.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.150
Yeah!

17:13.670 --> 17:14.339
Ponyo!

17:22.390 --> 17:23.890
Sousuke!

17:24.310 --> 17:25.380
Kumiko-chan...

17:25.380 --> 17:26.890
What's that?

17:26.890 --> 17:28.940
You're not supposed to bring stuff.

17:29.360 --> 17:33.530
But these trees aren't on school grounds, so that should be fine.

17:33.530 --> 17:34.780
Show me.

17:36.070 --> 17:37.700
Oh, a goldfish.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.070
It's not a goldfish. It's Ponyo.

17:40.070 --> 17:42.370
Ponyo? I want to see!

17:42.750 --> 17:44.830
Promise not to tell?

17:44.830 --> 17:46.120
I promise.

17:48.170 --> 17:50.130
Isn't she cute?

17:56.380 --> 18:00.300
It looks weird and fat. My goldfish is much cuter.

18:22.700 --> 18:27.040
It's Kumiko-chan's fault. She was mean to you.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.840
I'll give you some more water.

18:55.150 --> 18:56.110
Ponyo!

19:03.240 --> 19:04.120
You scared me.

19:09.460 --> 19:15.130
Why, how odd. That was Sousuke-chan's voice.

19:16.090 --> 19:20.340
But he's supposed to be in school.

19:20.340 --> 19:22.680
I must be hearing things.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.890
I'm here, Yoshie-san.

19:26.350 --> 19:29.980
I knew I heard your voice.

19:31.350 --> 19:33.730
Do I have a secret?

19:33.730 --> 19:34.730
Yes!

19:34.730 --> 19:35.860
Bingo!

19:36.570 --> 19:39.150
Okay, what color is my secret?

19:41.780 --> 19:43.660
Red!

19:44.070 --> 19:45.240
Good guess.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.580
How'd you know?

19:48.580 --> 19:50.080
Show us.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.000
All right.

19:53.920 --> 19:55.640
Oh, how pretty!

19:55.640 --> 19:57.250
Very cute!

19:57.250 --> 19:58.590
Her name is Ponyo.

19:58.590 --> 20:01.720
She loves ham and she can do magic.

20:02.550 --> 20:06.550
I cut my thumb, but she fixed it.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.520
I wonder if she'd fix our legs.

20:12.520 --> 20:16.560
We could run around just like you.

20:17.270 --> 20:20.820
Well, I'd have to ask Ponyo first.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.110
Can I take a look?

20:23.110 --> 20:24.450
Sure, Toki-san.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.620
Heavens, it has a face!

20:30.700 --> 20:35.000
Put it back before it brings a tsunami!

20:35.000 --> 20:38.290
You're so superstitious, Toki-san.

20:38.290 --> 20:41.630
That's what the old stories say.

20:41.630 --> 20:43.720
Fish like that are bad luck.

20:46.260 --> 20:49.260
The tsunami! It's here!

20:50.510 --> 20:52.430
The tsunami is here!

20:53.060 --> 20:54.440
Tsunami...

20:58.020 --> 20:59.690
What's wrong, Toki-san?

20:59.690 --> 21:02.070
Just look at my clothes!

21:09.990 --> 21:11.540
Sousuke!

21:16.330 --> 21:18.420
Sousuke!

21:20.840 --> 21:22.500
Sousuke!

21:24.260 --> 21:26.380
Sousuke!

21:26.380 --> 21:28.970
Come back here and apologize to Toki-san!

21:38.350 --> 21:42.150
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

21:44.110 --> 21:45.400
Sousuke.

21:48.950 --> 21:50.490
Sousuke.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.830
Ponyo!

21:58.290 --> 22:00.630
Ponyo. Sousuke.

22:01.290 --> 22:03.420
Ponyo... loves...

22:04.000 --> 22:04.920
...Sousuke!

22:10.970 --> 22:12.390
I love you too.

22:12.970 --> 22:15.350
Ponyo loves Sousuke!

22:56.220 --> 22:57.810
Ponyo!

22:59.020 --> 23:01.480
Ponyo!

23:02.730 --> 23:03.440
Ponyo!

23:06.190 --> 23:08.110
Ponyo!

23:09.490 --> 23:11.410
Ponyo!

23:09.780 --> 23:11.410
Sousuke!

23:13.160 --> 23:14.950
Ponyo!

23:15.450 --> 23:16.290
Ponyo!

23:16.700 --> 23:18.120
Ponyo!

23:18.420 --> 23:19.460
Ponyo!

23:21.120 --> 23:22.250
Ponyo!

24:16.850 --> 24:20.020
Listen, Sousuke. Maybe it was fate.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.270
It just can't be helped.

24:23.190 --> 24:25.480
Ponyo was born in the sea.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.360
She went back home. That's all.

24:27.900 --> 24:31.320
Anyway, let's hope that creepy guy is gone.

24:32.650 --> 24:33.740
One lick?

24:34.860 --> 24:36.410
Hurry, it's melting!

24:39.660 --> 24:41.040
Not bad!

24:46.170 --> 24:49.500
Cheer up. Koichi will be home tonight.

24:50.630 --> 24:53.880
He'll be disappointed if you're feeling down.

25:19.870 --> 25:22.330
No more ocean today, okay?

25:49.440 --> 25:50.690
Sousuke?

25:51.860 --> 25:53.440
Time to come inside.

25:53.940 --> 25:58.450
Do you think this bucket will help Ponyo find us?

25:58.860 --> 26:01.950
There's only one way to find out.

26:16.050 --> 26:19.680
Can you get that, Sousuke? It must be Koichi.

26:21.970 --> 26:23.350
Hello?

26:23.350 --> 26:25.140
Yes, it's me.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.940
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

26:27.940 --> 26:32.270
I can't get back tonight. I'll signal when I'm offshore.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.730
Okay. Here's Lisa.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.280
Koichi? Yes... What?!

26:39.990 --> 26:42.370
Can't you get out of it?

26:42.370 --> 26:46.200
Fine... Leave your wife and son up on the cliff!

26:46.390 --> 26:47.830
I give up!

26:51.460 --> 26:53.380
Why bother?

26:53.380 --> 26:55.460
C'mon, Sousuke. Let's eat out!

26:56.590 --> 26:58.300
I want to eat here.

27:27.290 --> 27:28.160
There he is!

27:28.160 --> 27:31.000
Turn off the lights, Lisa.

27:54.900 --> 27:59.030
It's Sousuke! He's a genius. Only five years old.

27:59.030 --> 28:00.900
Your wife must be upset.

28:05.490 --> 28:09.040
He says he's sorry.

THANKS

28:58.790 --> 29:01.710
LOVE AND KISSES

29:19.440 --> 29:21.650
Don't cry, Lisa.

29:22.690 --> 29:24.240
I won't cry.

29:25.650 --> 29:29.490
I promised Ponyo, I'd take care of her.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.620
I hope she isn't crying.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.420
Okay, let's cheer up!

29:44.380 --> 29:47.130
<i>"I'm happy as can be..."</i>

29:47.930 --> 29:49.470
Ow!

29:49.470 --> 29:51.100
Don't worry, Sousuke.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.140
I'm sure Ponyo is fine too.

29:57.060 --> 30:01.060
Now, let's eat. We'll eat Koichi's dinner too!

30:10.870 --> 30:12.580
This is all my fault.

30:12.580 --> 30:17.210
Bringing you along to watch me was a mistake.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.290
How often have I warned you about humans?

30:21.470 --> 30:23.800
Their very breath is polluted.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.300
Come, you must eat.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.800
Can't you hear me, Brunhilde?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.300
I want ham!

30:33.910 --> 30:37.810
H-Ham?! What on earth have you been doing?

30:37.810 --> 30:39.850
Answer me, Brunhilde!

30:39.850 --> 30:43.190
My name's not Brunhilde. It's Ponyo.

30:43.530 --> 30:45.190
P- Po- Ponyo?

30:45.190 --> 30:47.990
Ponyo loves Sousuke.

30:47.990 --> 30:50.990
I want to be human!

30:51.490 --> 30:52.950
Human?

30:52.950 --> 30:55.830
How could you love such disgusting creatures?

30:56.620 --> 30:59.410
They rob the sea of life.

31:00.170 --> 31:02.830
I was human myself... once.

31:03.290 --> 31:05.990
I finally escaped that awful heritage...

31:05.990 --> 31:08.170
I want hands!

31:08.720 --> 31:11.180
I don't like this!

31:12.010 --> 31:15.060
I want legs like Sousuke!

31:15.060 --> 31:16.640
Of all the nonsense!

31:35.950 --> 31:39.410
Look at me! Hands and feet!

31:40.000 --> 31:40.850
Look at me!

31:40.850 --> 31:44.750
No... Don't tell me you tasted human blood?!

31:44.750 --> 31:46.390
Wanna see Sousuke!

31:46.390 --> 31:50.340
No! His blood has deranged your DNA!

31:50.340 --> 31:53.510
Revert... Revert...

31:58.770 --> 32:01.730
Go back... Go back!

32:05.610 --> 32:08.030
It's not working. I need more power.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.710
Let me out!

32:22.710 --> 32:26.130
Be still, you evil blood.

32:26.130 --> 32:28.960
Revert, revert!

32:38.220 --> 32:42.020
Just like her mother... So strong.

32:47.230 --> 32:50.440
She should remain innocent and pure forever.

33:11.420 --> 33:14.510
I can't hold her for long.

33:14.510 --> 33:17.050
I need her mother's help.

33:26.350 --> 33:29.150
No! My elixir is too strong for you!

33:29.570 --> 33:31.570
Shoo! Go away!

33:31.800 --> 33:35.070
My crab shields were weakening.

33:35.070 --> 33:37.320
I nearly upset Nature's balance.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.700
I must stay calm.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.540
When I think of meeting her again, I'm starting to get nervous.

33:42.540 --> 33:45.870
This batch should be ready.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.010
No leaks down here.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.350
This door is loose.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.230
I'll fix it later.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.489
If even one creature got in here...

34:43.719 --> 34:45.270
Superb!

34:45.270 --> 34:49.810
I feel the ocean's power in my very DNA.

34:50.440 --> 34:54.860
When this well is full, the Era of the Ocean will begin.

34:54.860 --> 34:58.110
An explosion of life to match the Cambrian Era!

34:58.110 --> 35:00.820
This revolting era of Man will be over.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.500
Better fix this door.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.080
Teeth!

36:41.090 --> 36:43.340
I'm going back to Sousuke!

39:14.650 --> 39:15.740
A waterspout?

39:15.740 --> 39:18.000
Captain, look there!

39:21.210 --> 39:22.810
Tsunami!

39:22.810 --> 39:24.630
Turn her into the waves!

39:26.260 --> 39:27.840
What's that?

39:32.720 --> 39:35.810
Captain! Radio's out, the radar too!

39:39.270 --> 39:42.940
A little girl? She must be Sousuke's age!

39:52.870 --> 39:55.120
Bye-bye. See you tomorrow.

39:56.830 --> 39:59.620
Thanks. Take care.

40:00.710 --> 40:04.040
Sou-chan, do you want to wait here together?

40:04.040 --> 40:05.960
It's okay. I'll take the shortcut.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.460
Goodbye, Sensei.

40:07.460 --> 40:08.840
Goodbye.

40:09.380 --> 40:10.720
Be careful out there.

40:53.430 --> 40:56.890
Sorry, Sousuke. The door wouldn't open, would it?

40:56.890 --> 40:58.390
The power's out.

40:58.390 --> 40:59.850
Was the school okay?

41:00.270 --> 41:03.850
Lisa-san, we'll be fine. Go home.

41:03.850 --> 41:05.230
Are you sure?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.980
Don't worry. We'll be just fine.

41:08.360 --> 41:13.700
We're spending the night anyway. You should go while you can.

41:14.910 --> 41:16.950
Wait for me, Sousuke.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.050
Yoshie-san.

41:30.920 --> 41:35.840
Why, Sou-chan... It's so dark, I didn't see you.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.180
This is for you.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.640
My, what is it?

41:43.640 --> 41:45.440
One for you, Noriko-san.

41:45.440 --> 41:47.150
Thank you.

41:47.150 --> 41:49.520
Can't see a thing.

41:49.710 --> 41:52.530
This is such foolishness!

41:52.530 --> 41:55.490
I don't want to spend the night.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.030
The power's on.

42:00.030 --> 42:00.920
Oh, good.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.790
Certainly is.

42:02.790 --> 42:04.080
It's a goldfish!

42:04.080 --> 42:08.580
Maybe Sou-chan's magic made the lights go on?

42:08.580 --> 42:11.590
<i>Extremely powerful...
Micro typhoon...</i>

42:11.590 --> 42:14.170
<i>Ships should exercise extreme caution...</i>

42:15.380 --> 42:17.300
This TV is useless.

42:17.520 --> 42:22.510
Those idiots couldn't forecast their way out of a paper bag.

42:22.510 --> 42:24.560
You should go home, Sou-chan.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.440
Your goldfish will bring us luck.

42:27.440 --> 42:30.020
We're not afraid now.

42:38.570 --> 42:40.240
Here's yours, Toki-san.

42:44.040 --> 42:47.750
It's all wrinkled.
What is it?

42:47.750 --> 42:48.670
Like this.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.250
I know! It's a grasshopper.

42:53.250 --> 42:55.630
<i>No, the Koganei Maru.</i>

42:55.630 --> 42:59.010
That's your father's ship, right?

42:59.550 --> 43:01.720
Still looks like a grasshopper.

43:02.180 --> 43:06.020
We're leaving, Sousuke.
Say goodbye to everyone.

43:08.190 --> 43:10.770
Goodbye, everybody.

43:10.770 --> 43:12.650
Goodbye.

43:13.320 --> 43:15.780
Don't let the wind blow you away!

43:16.820 --> 43:18.280
Climb over.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.910
The phones are out too.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.520
The sea is puffed up!

43:54.650 --> 43:57.110
Will the ships sink?

43:57.480 --> 44:01.950
They're safe out at sea.
I'm sure that's where Koichi is.

44:13.570 --> 44:17.130
- I see fish, Lisa.
- Your seatbelt!

44:27.890 --> 44:30.310
You've got to turn back!

44:30.310 --> 44:33.190
People are going to the shelters.

44:33.190 --> 44:37.650
But there are people at the senior center!

44:37.930 --> 44:41.740
They'll be all right.
They're on the leeward side.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.370
I've just got to get home.

44:45.370 --> 44:47.830
You'd better go around the mountain.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.750
Here we go, Sousuke.

44:54.120 --> 44:55.790
No! Stop!

44:55.790 --> 44:57.570
Look out for that wave!

45:03.010 --> 45:04.300
Here it comes!

45:04.300 --> 45:06.470
Run for it, Lisa-san!

45:46.590 --> 45:48.100
The fish are following us.

45:48.100 --> 45:49.640
Seatbelt, Sousuke!

46:03.400 --> 46:05.030
Hold on tight!

46:57.330 --> 46:58.960
That wave won't quit!

47:09.520 --> 47:13.350
A little girl fell in.
She was riding a fish.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.690
Where?

47:28.740 --> 47:30.540
The sea keeps rising.

47:30.540 --> 47:32.740
Where did you see her?

47:32.740 --> 47:35.790
Running on top of a fish.

47:35.790 --> 47:36.830
A fish?!

47:41.540 --> 47:42.750
Come on, Sousuke.

47:58.970 --> 48:02.140
Hang on, Sousuke!
We're almost home.

48:56.550 --> 48:58.080
A little girl!

48:58.080 --> 49:01.120
It's dangerous out here. You'd better come with us.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.790
Stay there, Sousuke.

49:29.070 --> 49:31.150
Sousuke, do you know her?

49:52.550 --> 49:53.800
Ponyo?

49:54.720 --> 49:56.970
Yes, it's me!

49:57.260 --> 49:58.390
It's you!

50:00.310 --> 50:04.100
Ponyo's a little girl now, Lisa!

50:15.700 --> 50:17.990
I made it!

50:36.090 --> 50:39.180
Now listen, children.

50:39.180 --> 50:43.020
No matter how strange everything seems...

50:43.020 --> 50:45.230
...we have to stay calm, all right?

50:46.230 --> 50:47.390
Now be good.

50:51.270 --> 50:53.650
Take off your rain coat, Sousuke.

50:53.980 --> 50:56.570
Here, Ponyo, you hold the light.

51:01.280 --> 51:03.530
I'll bring you a towel.

51:20.550 --> 51:21.970
C'mon, Ponyo!

51:24.140 --> 51:26.270
It smells just like you!

51:29.020 --> 51:29.940
Ouch!

51:29.940 --> 51:30.810
Ponyo!

51:35.690 --> 51:39.400
Gotcha! Let's get you dried off.

51:43.490 --> 51:46.040
Such pretty red hair!

51:48.660 --> 51:50.210
But your clothes are dry...

51:50.710 --> 51:54.710
Ponyo was a fish.
Water doesn't make her wet.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.220
I like this!

52:00.220 --> 52:03.720
All right! Who wants a hot drink?

52:03.720 --> 52:06.470
Help me with the light, Ponyo.

52:06.470 --> 52:08.230
Coming!

52:08.230 --> 52:10.350
Think we'll have water?

52:10.570 --> 52:11.600
Sure!

52:11.730 --> 52:12.850
Sure!

52:15.940 --> 52:16.890
Water!

52:16.710 --> 52:17.820
Water!

52:18.990 --> 52:21.610
We have a tank outside.

52:23.320 --> 52:25.740
What about the gas?

52:25.740 --> 52:26.620
Presto!

52:27.240 --> 52:27.950
All right!

52:28.160 --> 52:29.370
All right!

52:29.370 --> 52:31.330
It's propane.

52:33.880 --> 52:35.750
Okay, take your seats.

52:36.550 --> 52:37.880
Okay!

52:37.880 --> 52:39.670
Over here, Ponyo.

52:45.600 --> 52:47.060
Sit down, like this.

52:50.310 --> 52:52.060
Put your stuff down.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.400
You need your hands.

52:56.400 --> 52:57.860
I have feet!

53:00.780 --> 53:02.070
Wow!

53:05.240 --> 53:07.280
What are you two doing?

53:07.280 --> 53:09.990
Her feet are like hands.

53:29.850 --> 53:30.930
There you go.

53:32.770 --> 53:33.640
Here.

53:38.860 --> 53:40.480
This is the best!

54:28.910 --> 54:30.410
That hit the spot.

54:31.370 --> 54:34.330
What shall we do now?

54:34.750 --> 54:36.500
I want ham!

54:36.500 --> 54:38.540
She's crazy about ham.

54:40.170 --> 54:42.460
Then let's eat.

54:42.460 --> 54:45.420
But first let's start the generator.

54:46.760 --> 54:50.090
We need electricity to talk to Koichi.

54:51.010 --> 54:53.720
Koichi is my father.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.520
Is he a bad sorcerer?

54:55.520 --> 54:59.100
No, silly. He's a ship captain.

54:59.650 --> 55:01.610
What about your father, Ponyo?

55:01.920 --> 55:04.940
Fujimoto! He keeps me prisoner.

55:05.900 --> 55:08.200
I ran away.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.240
What about your mother?

55:11.670 --> 55:15.080
I love my mother!

55:15.080 --> 55:17.830
She's really scary.

55:17.830 --> 55:19.120
Sounds like Lisa.

55:24.170 --> 55:25.800
Can you help me, Ponyo?

55:43.150 --> 55:44.860
Maybe the fuel's too old?

55:45.360 --> 55:46.860
Is it clogged?

55:46.860 --> 55:47.990
Clogged.

55:47.990 --> 55:50.360
It's clogged there.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.670
Success!

56:07.090 --> 56:08.550
All bright!

56:10.590 --> 56:12.050
Wow, Ponyo!

56:30.360 --> 56:32.280
Antenna! Antenna!

56:32.280 --> 56:35.280
Did all the ships sink, Lisa?

56:36.620 --> 56:38.540
I can't see a single light.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.810
So loud!

56:58.810 --> 56:59.770
What's wrong?

57:00.850 --> 57:03.520
Even the radio is out of whack.

57:04.520 --> 57:08.770
This is JA4LL... JA4LL.

57:08.940 --> 57:11.030
<i>Come in, Koichi.</i>

57:11.030 --> 57:15.490
<i>It's Lisa, Sousuke and Ponyo.
We're all doing fine.</i>

57:16.700 --> 57:18.950
We're going to have dinner.

57:19.410 --> 57:20.790
Ham!

57:29.590 --> 57:32.760
Ready? Careful, it's hot.

57:48.820 --> 57:50.730
It's not ready yet.

57:50.730 --> 57:52.280
It takes three minutes.

58:07.380 --> 58:09.170
Close your eyes!

58:10.000 --> 58:11.380
Not yet!

58:13.920 --> 58:15.670
No peeking, Ponyo.

58:19.560 --> 58:21.680
Okay, you can look now.

58:22.350 --> 58:24.940
And... presto!

58:30.940 --> 58:32.150
Ham!

58:32.150 --> 58:33.860
Good for you, Ponyo.

58:55.130 --> 58:57.220
Lisa, Ponyo fell asleep.

59:04.430 --> 59:06.890
Is her home far away?

59:06.890 --> 59:08.730
I think it must be.

59:24.580 --> 59:27.410
Look, Sousuke. The sea is calmer.

59:28.370 --> 59:30.040
Because Ponyo's asleep?

59:30.040 --> 59:31.710
Look over there!

59:39.550 --> 59:42.600
It's moving. Someone's up there.

59:42.600 --> 59:44.510
People from the senior center?

59:51.060 --> 59:52.310
It's gone.

59:52.310 --> 59:53.900
That's the peak road.

59:57.740 --> 59:59.700
Sousuke, stay there with Ponyo.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:14.960
Maybe I could get through on the mountain road.

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:20.630
I'm going to the senior center.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:21.840
I'll go too.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.100
Stay here with Ponyo.

01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:28.680
I'm going too.
Let's take Ponyo with us.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:30.850
I'm going with you!

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.980
Sousuke, our house is a lighthouse in the storm.

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:41.160
Everyone out there is depending on us.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.110
Someone has to stay here.

01:00:44.070 --> 01:00:48.870
Lots of things are happening that I don't understand.

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:53.620
But right now I'm worried about
the people at the senior center.

01:00:54.210 --> 01:00:58.380
Just knowing you're here will help me.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.380
Don't worry. I promise to come back.

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:03.880
Promise?

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.810
I promise.

01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:08.310
You promised!

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:10.890
I love you, Sousuke.

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:09.200
I see the lights of the town!

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.200
Finally...

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.580
Now we can navigate.

01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:14.830
I've never seen that town before.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.590
Did the storm blow us to America?

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.690
That's not a mountain. And that's no harbor...

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:46.360
Those are ships!

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.250
The sea is piled up into a mountain!

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.050
It's a ship graveyard.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:04.210
What's going on?

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.930
We lost power!

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:14.060
Heave to! Drop the sea anchor!

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:14.890
Aye-aye!

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.320
Something is coming!

01:03:58.310 --> 01:03:59.900
A sea goddess?!

01:04:10.700 --> 01:04:11.780
The engine!

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.990
We're saved!

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:16.290
The engine started again. It was Her!

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:19.830
Protect us from harm...

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:48.480
Come on, come on.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:07.210
A barrier spell! Where did she learn this?

01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:28.270
Good heavens... she's human!

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:31.820
Hey, watch out! What are you doing?

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.130
Stop! This is unsafe!

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.250
Stop that at once!

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:58.010
I'm simply trying to save your sister.

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:06.310
She's here. She answered my call!

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.480
Fujimoto...

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.600
You came, my beloved.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.310
Such a beautiful ocean.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:58.320
So full of magic, like my ancient Devonian sea.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.320
It's Ponyo! She tasted human blood...

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.410
...and plundered all of my elixir.

01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.250
Ponyo...

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.790
What a lovely name.

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:16.420
It's all my fault.

01:07:17.010 --> 01:07:21.510
She's totally beyond my control.
It's a complete chaos.

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.260
She doesn't understand what she's done.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:30.020
<i>Now she's human, and she's up there with her boyfriend!</i>

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:34.360
If we don't stop her, the planet is doomed!

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:46.210
No! The satellites are falling.

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:48.710
Earth's gravitational field...

01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:51.460
Be still...

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.760
Sousuke... that is his name, yes?

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.980
You love your sister, don't you?

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:17.279
Listen, dear... What if Ponyo really became human?

01:08:18.029 --> 01:08:20.029
Use the old magic.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:24.870
If Sousuke's love is real, she'll lose her powers forever.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.620
But if it's not, she'll turn to sea foam!

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.960
That's where we all came from, dear.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.760
But he's only five. That's impossible!

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:45.720
Sleep well, little children.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:08:59.979
Sousuke!

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:02.870
Sousuke!

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.370
Ow!

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.830
Good morning, Ponyo.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.410
Morning, Sousuke.

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:21.210
We almost got flooded.

01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.660
Where's Lisa?

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.950
She must be stuck someplace.

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.000
I wish we had a boat.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.500
There's a boat!

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.010
We can't fit.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:01.380
Can so.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.570
Awesome!

01:10:21.610 --> 01:10:23.650
The candle's bigger too.

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:24.990
We can fit.

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.530
This is cool.

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:28.020
Cool!

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.240
Grab that end.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.370
Ready?

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.830
Ready!

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.100
She's seaworthy!

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.230
Awesome. No leaks!

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.730
Now we fill the boiler.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:00.400
The water goes in here.

01:11:01.470 --> 01:11:03.780
It goes in the boiler.

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:32.930
It's like a rocket!

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:41.980
Everything's shipshape.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.110
Shipshape...

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.240
Shipshape?

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.240
Shipshape!

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:50.740
Shipshape! Shipshape!

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:13.310
Is it hot?

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.310
Hot!

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.270
Hot!

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:20.690
It's hot.

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:25.440
The candle's burning.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.940
It's burning!

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:30.030
Hot! Hot! Hot!

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:39.540
It's hot.

01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:52.220
Awesome!

01:12:53.890 --> 01:12:56.850
We're shipshape, Sousuke!

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:58.810
This is great.

01:13:06.190 --> 01:13:08.320
This is so much fun.

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.150
It's burning, Sousuke.

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:14.740
It's really hot.

01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:17.540
Keep a lookout in front.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.240
I'll steer the boat.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.580
Okay, I'm the lookout.

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.110
There's a road.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:52.190
That's the road Lisa took.

01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:56.620
I don't see her.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.830
You will. She gave me her promise.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.210
Ancient fish... from the Devonian age!

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.380
There's Bothriolepis.

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.850
That one is...

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:18.070
Dipnorhynchus.

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:19.470
Dipnorhynchus!

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.180
That one's really huge.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.060
That's Devonynchus.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.430
Devonynchus!

01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:34.610
Ahoy!

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.160
A boat!

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.910
Ahoy!

01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.700
They're calling us.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:47.920
Ahoy!

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:50.550
Ow!

01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.550
Pretty good, huh?

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:04.730
Now, Ponyo.

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:12.400
Hello.

01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:13.440
Hello.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.240
That's a wonderful boat you have.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.320
Why, it's Lisa's little boy, Sou-chan.

01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:22.290
It's Sousuke, not Sou-chan!

01:15:22.290 --> 01:15:23.620
This is Ponyo.

01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:26.950
I was a fish before.

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:28.420
A fish?

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.460
Ponyo... that's a nice name.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:35.880
Mister, have you seen Lisa?

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.090
Lisa-san?

01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:39.970
She's not with you?

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.430
She's at the center.

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:42.970
The senior center?

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:44.470
This is my baby.

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.670
Oh, my. What happened?

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.720
Is that for us?

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:40.070
Give me the cup, dear.

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:46.370
Thank you.

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:48.540
Let's try it.

01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:54.080
Delicious soup!

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:56.340
Lisa made it.

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.380
It's for the baby.

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:03.890
Oh, I'm sorry. He can't handle soup yet.

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:08.390
But this will help me make milk for him.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.890
Lisa gave me her milk too.

01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.780
Ponyo, may I have this soup?

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.610
Sure.

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:20.280
Thank you.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.760
People from the town.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.420
It's like a festival.

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.300
You there! Do you need assistance?

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:51.560
Thanks, we're okay right now!

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.860
Then please follow us.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:57.980
We're going to the hotel on the peak.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:00.610
Okay! Will do.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.160
The whole town's here.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.830
I hope everyone's all right.

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:08.360
Let's go, Ponyo.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.370
Hold on a second.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.040
Milk!

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.880
Oh, my...

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:21.670
Milk!

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.340
She ate up all the ham.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.390
Thank you. This will help me make good milk.

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:31.640
Can you use another candle for your boat, Sousuke-kun?

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.350
Yeah. Ponyo will make it bigger.

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:35.640
Thanks.

01:18:36.190 --> 01:18:37.150
Be careful!

01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:38.400
Thank you both!

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.110
What is it, dear?

01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:52.160
Don't cry.

01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:12.810
Ponyo!

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.160
Sou-chan!

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.030
It's Sou-chan!

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:28.610
Amazing!

01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:29.450
Looks cool!

01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:32.490
Where's Lisa-san? Isn't she with you?

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:35.750
I'm going to pick her up.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:39.460
So she survived that wave?

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:42.500
Sousuke, take me with you!

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.590
Later, Kumiko-chan. I'm busy right now.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.430
Everyone from the center evacuated to the park.

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:50.340
Take care!

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.680
You can do it!

01:19:52.180 --> 01:19:55.890
We'll send a boat for them later.

01:19:55.890 --> 01:19:58.150
Good luck, captain!

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.990
Time for a new candle, Ponyo.

01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:56.950
We're okay. I have another one.

01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:58.710
Ow!

01:20:59.330 --> 01:21:00.830
It's still pretty hot.

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.260
Bye-bye.

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:13.010
Can you make this candle bigger?

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:14.220
All right.

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.980
Are you sleepy, Ponyo?

01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:31.110
Ponyo!

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:49.000
Ponyo! Ponyo!

01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:49.310
Good... It's shallow enough to walk.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.140
A road!

01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:31.190
It's shrinking!

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.940
Ponyo!

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:54.920
Ponyo!

01:23:56.130 --> 01:23:58.220
Ponyo, wake up!

01:24:00.850 --> 01:24:02.510
Sousuke...

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.860
I'm relieved.

01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:13.110
I thought you were turning into a fish.

01:24:25.620 --> 01:24:26.580
Lisa's car!

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.000
Ponyo, that's her car!

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.420
Lisa!

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.590
Lisa!

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.170
Lisa!

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.800
Lisa!

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.640
Lisa!

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.600
Lisa!

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:50.980
Lisa!

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.350
Lisa!

01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.030
Lisa!

01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:03.700
Lisa!

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:34.610
Here's your boat.

01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:37.030
Your eyes are wet.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.990
Let's find Lisa.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:34.550
You forgot your wrap!

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:36.500
Who needs it?

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.750
Hurry up!

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:39.550
Look, it's a whale!

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.630
My knees don't hurt anymore!

01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:45.680
What were we so afraid of?

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.720
Is this the Other Side?

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.720
Who cares? It's wonderful.

01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.520
Attention, please! Gather round.

01:26:54.810 --> 01:26:56.230
Coming!

01:26:56.230 --> 01:26:57.980
Shall we?

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.280
It's so nice to run.

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:04.450
Meet you there!

01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.910
The winner!

01:27:11.290 --> 01:27:13.580
You're so fast, Kayo-san.

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.250
Quiet, everyone!

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.370
The moment of truth is at hand.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.210
Sousuke-kun and Ponyo are almost here.

01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:23.840
It's so romantic.

01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.260
Will love triumph?

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.930
I'm so excited!

01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:30.810
Quiet!

01:27:30.810 --> 01:27:33.640
Very soon, you will bear witness to a sacred trial of love.

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.890
I'm asking you to wait patiently.

01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:41.980
Fujimoto-san, you're not up to something, are you?

01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:43.940
I hope not!

01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.110
Nonsense, he's her father.

01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:46.400
They'll be fine...

01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:49.580
...if she doesn't wake up.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.570
Now excuse me!

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:02.000
I'd like to believe him...

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.590
Where's Lisa-san gone to?

01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:09.380
She's been talking with Ponyo's mother for ages.

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:20.110
I hope she's okay.

01:28:20.110 --> 01:28:22.480
What are they talking about?

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:25.770
Let's find out. Lisa-san!

01:28:25.770 --> 01:28:28.900
Lisa-san!

01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:41.540
We're all rooting for Sousuke and Ponyo!

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:56.020
Lisa-san!

01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:57.390
You must be worried.

01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:59.650
Sou-chan will be just fine.

01:28:59.650 --> 01:29:02.360
He's a strong little boy.

01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:06.480
Thanks, everyone. He'll need your support.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.530
Ponyo, it's a tunnel.

01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:28.630
STOP

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:35.390
I've been here before.

01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:37.430
Ponyo?

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.850
I don't like this place.

01:29:44.110 --> 01:29:46.020
Don't let go of my hand.

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020
Ponyo!

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:45.580
Ponyo!

01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:54.920
Ponyo!

01:31:16.890 --> 01:31:19.200
Please don't die!

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.740
Ponyo!

01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:24.580
Wake up, Ponyo!

01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:27.160
Let her sleep.

01:31:28.380 --> 01:31:30.540
I've been waiting for you, Sousuke-kun.

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:33.840
Lisa-san and the old ladies are waiting too.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.840
Lisa?!

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:39.470
Won't you come with me? You and Ponyo.

01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:45.270
Let's not wake her up.

01:31:45.270 --> 01:31:46.890
Sousuke!

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.560
Don't listen to him!

01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:54.440
He tricked everyone into going with him.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:55.610
Toki-san!

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:57.440
But he couldn't fool me!

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.320
There's no time, I tell you.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:03.830
Don't you see what's happening?

01:32:03.830 --> 01:32:07.450
If the Moon comes any closer, we're finished!

01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:10.830
Liar! Is that the best you can do?

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:13.800
Sousuke, come here!

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.930
Listen to me, Sousuke-kun.
You're the planet's last hope.

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:19.420
Don't make me use force.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.840
Ponyo!

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.260
Is this how you treat your father?

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:34.360
Ponyo!

01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:37.190
Run, Sousuke!

01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:38.990
You don't understand!

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.200
You can make it!

01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:49.700
Jump!

01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:30.330
Now what?

01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.350
Lisa!

01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:27.680
Sousuke!

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:28.720
Ponyo!

01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:35.350
Look over there.

01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:37.440
Where are we?

01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:49.780
So you are Sousuke-san.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.290
Hello.

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:53.410
Are you Ponyo's mother?

01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:54.750
Yes.

01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:59.750
I want to thank you for bringing my daughter back to me.

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.800
Sousuke-san...

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.840
Ponyo wanted to be like you, but she unleashed a terrible power.

01:35:06.850 --> 01:35:10.850
To become human, she must be loved...

01:35:10.850 --> 01:35:13.850
...for who she really is.

01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:18.440
Do you know that Ponyo was a fish?

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:19.690
Yes.

01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:23.780
Your blood made her almost human.

01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:24.950
That's right!

01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:28.530
Ponyo licked my cut and made it better.

01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:30.990
So that's why she changed!

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.750
Can you accept her as she is?

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.370
I'll always love Ponyo...

01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:40.960
...whether she's a fish, a human...

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:42.590
...or in between.

01:35:56.690 --> 01:35:59.110
Come, Ponyo.

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:18.200
Ponyo, Sousuke-san has promised to accept you as you are.

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.710
But first, you must give up your powers.

01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:26.380
Can you do that?

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:40.900
Kiss this bubble when you return to land...

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:44.860
...and Ponyo will be a little girl.

01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:50.240
Way to go, Ponyo!

01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:53.530
Thank you, Ponyo's mother!

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:03.250
Now the planet is safe again.

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.510
Splendid, Sou-chan!

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:10.090
Sousuke!

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.350
Sousuke!

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.220
Sousuke!

01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:42.160
I'm grateful, Lisa.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:45.250
Thank you, Gran Mamare.

01:37:56.680 --> 01:37:59.520
Is everyone all right?

01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:06.940
Wait, I'll get the wheelchairs.

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:09.190
Don't bother. We'll walk.

01:38:09.190 --> 01:38:11.480
It's all so exciting.

01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:16.740
I believe this is yours.

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.240
Thanks.

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:22.700
I hope you'll forgive me...

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.750
Um... May I?

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.170
Take good care of her.

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.180
It's Koichi!

01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:42.440
Koichi!

01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:49.440
It's Lisa! And there's Sousuke!

01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:54.440
Look, Ponyo. It's Koichi!
