WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:02.803
-Previously on Outsiders...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.004
-GORDON: If I can't bring you

00:04.038 --> 00:06.407
to see what you're killing,
maybe I'll bring

00:06.440 --> 00:08.509
what you're killing to you.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.578
-HOUGHTON: Goddamn it.
-GUARD: Anybody wants to go past

00:10.611 --> 00:12.280
this point here, I got to clear
it with Mr. Meyers' office.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.415
They're calling all this
private property.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.550
(coughing)

00:16.584 --> 00:19.387
HOUGHTON: It's not too late
to start treatment.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.155
-You can still do that.
-No.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.091
I can't outrun this forever.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.226
HOUGHTON: With things amping up,
I can't protect you.

00:25.259 --> 00:28.362
-So I think it'd be better
if you just disappear. -Okay.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.331
-I look ridiculous.
-SALLY-ANN (laughs): No.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.799
It's just,
I-I look in the mirror,

00:31.832 --> 00:33.534
I just, I don't see myself.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.303
That's kind of the point,
isn't it?

00:36.504 --> 00:38.272
(men clamoring)

00:40.474 --> 00:42.676
MEYERS: Foster Farrell
killed an inmate.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.212
Broke his neck.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.214
-I don't believe you.
-Why not? Is it because

00:46.247 --> 00:48.316
you had a hunch
that he was a good man?

00:48.349 --> 00:49.583
Just tell us what we have to do.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.719
He's being transferred
from a county facility

00:51.752 --> 00:53.854
that's quite near to here
to a state prison

00:53.887 --> 00:55.389
many, many miles away.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.393
(tires screeching)

01:02.496 --> 01:04.865
-Hey, let's go! -MEYERS:
Lucky thing they got ahold

01:04.898 --> 01:06.767
of that
prisoner transfer schedule.

01:06.800 --> 01:07.868
Somehow.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.271
Get your goddamn hands off me.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.211
(people gasping)

01:17.245 --> 01:20.514
When I go,
that Oak will be yours again.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.417
And you have changed.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.686
But the darkness
is still there, too.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.563
*

01:47.941 --> 01:49.743
(man whooping)

01:49.777 --> 01:52.313
*

01:59.287 --> 02:03.424
They got a real love for you,
I must say.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.925
Never had that for me.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.662
-They're just deep
in their drink, is all. -Mm.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.301
(man laughing)

02:13.334 --> 02:16.570
I got blood on my hands.

02:16.604 --> 02:19.873
You sacrificed yourself
to rid us of the Kinnah.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.176
They will forgive you.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.746
We are all worthy
of second chances.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.516
I hope so.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.551
Though it seems
you're on your fifth.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.286
-(helicopter approaching)
-(music stops)

02:32.320 --> 02:34.288
(people screaming, shouting)

02:50.704 --> 02:53.574
Stop. Foster, stop! Stop!

02:53.607 --> 02:55.576
Stop. Stop.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.517
(country blues music playing)

03:05.453 --> 03:08.922
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

03:08.956 --> 03:13.561
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

03:13.594 --> 03:16.664
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

03:16.697 --> 03:19.300
* And they'll go running back

03:19.333 --> 03:22.403
* To the wretched realm
they came *

03:24.872 --> 03:30.811
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

03:30.844 --> 03:33.414
* And the land

03:33.447 --> 03:36.917
* Will suffer those who came.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.958
*

04:01.409 --> 04:04.345
(panting)

04:07.315 --> 04:09.283
Are you all right?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.488
I'm free.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.760
I'm free.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.071
HOUGHTON:
Let's go. Come on.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.940
Out, out.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.509
-(slapping hood) -Let's go.
Come on, kids, let's go.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.511
What are you doing?
What's that about?

04:37.545 --> 04:39.813
-I feel carsick. -I don't care
if you feel carsick.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.916
Your shirt's undone. Do it up.
Let's go. We gotta go to church.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.386
-Hey, Hilda, what you doing?
-I'll wait over here.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.924
Hey, Abby, can you take him in?
And find two seats, okay?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.560
Two spare seats.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.862
Get off your phone.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.464
What's this all about?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.532
Praying is bullshit.
There is no God.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.100
-Hey, watch your mouth.
-It's not like

05:00.133 --> 05:02.035
it's gonna bring back my dad
or cure my mother,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.672
-so what's the point? -I'm
gonna tell you something, okay?

05:04.705 --> 05:06.874
'Cause someday you're gonna
have to tell your kids this

05:06.907 --> 05:09.109
when they're old enough.
Okay, you ready?

05:09.142 --> 05:11.545
Nobody wants to go
to church. Okay?

05:11.579 --> 05:14.982
God and all that stuff,
none of it means anything, okay?

05:15.015 --> 05:16.550
I tried it all
after Andi-Rae died

05:16.584 --> 05:18.085
and when your mom got sick.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.388
I mean, I did crazy things
to try to make her better.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.523
-It didn't do nothing.
-So I don't have to go?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.125
No, you got to go to church.
Do you know what life's about?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.728
It's about making sacrifices
that make other people happy.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.130
And, you know, going to church
makes your mom happy.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.433
So, come on, keep me company.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.067
We'll be miserable together.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.838
-Put your phone away.
-(organ playing)

05:42.042 --> 05:44.011
(wheels squeaking)

05:49.450 --> 05:51.919
(airplane approaching)

05:58.792 --> 06:01.061
(coughing)

06:03.497 --> 06:05.365
(coughing continues)

06:11.839 --> 06:13.373
(coughs)

06:14.942 --> 06:16.410
(groans)

06:16.444 --> 06:18.612
(panting)

06:18.646 --> 06:19.813
(toilet flushes)

06:19.847 --> 06:20.848
(groans)

06:23.183 --> 06:24.685
(groans)

06:28.722 --> 06:30.691
(panting)

06:36.997 --> 06:38.966
*

06:46.173 --> 06:47.808
Hey there.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.547
You a friend of Caleb's?

06:57.551 --> 06:59.520
Are you lost, sweetie?

07:00.888 --> 07:01.789
Oh.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.492
Hey. It's all right.

07:07.595 --> 07:10.130
Everything's gonna be all right.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.639
(Gerralt panting)

07:18.672 --> 07:20.974
Wasn't the only place
to get hit.

07:21.008 --> 07:25.045
Mertha Shay's corn beds, the
alfalfa out by the falls, too.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.214
-Oh, God.
-(G'Win exhales)

07:27.247 --> 07:29.617
That'd take the hide off a colt.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.019
(chuckles) Pretty sure
it's taken mine off.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.255
Soak a rag in goat's milk
and yellowroot,

07:35.288 --> 07:37.190
put it over your eyes;
it should counteract

07:37.224 --> 07:38.892
whatever poison this is.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.260
(Gerralt sniffles)

07:40.293 --> 07:43.130
Been working these fields
for 15 years.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.066
Soil was as fertile as it gets.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.035
Feels like a death.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.005
-What kind of people would do
something like this? -Cowards.

07:52.039 --> 07:54.041
Attack us
from 50 feet in the air

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
so they don't have
to face us directly.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.711
KRAKE:
Bren'in!

07:57.745 --> 08:00.147
Uh, sorry for the intrusion.
Silas Shay's ailing,

08:00.180 --> 08:02.816
and they need your doctoring,
quick as you can.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.221
What the hell's going on
over here?

08:08.255 --> 08:10.658
Geez, get off your phones.
You're at church.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.627
We're not at church, Uncle Wade,
we're outside of church.

08:13.661 --> 08:17.197
-That's close enough.
-Wade? Wade Houghton?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.199
Hello.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.801
Dana. Dana Miller.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.971
Oh. Dana Miller, like,
from Blackburg Elementary?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.974
(laughs) I mean, minus
the braids and braces, but yeah.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.108
-Yeah.
-Okay. Hey, come here.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.843
What are you doing?
Come back here.

08:29.877 --> 08:33.013
You can have one of them.
Go take the rest back.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.716
-Sorry.
-Are all these kids yours?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.250
Uh, no, the...

08:37.284 --> 08:39.987
cookie monster's mine,
and, uh, these two here,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.855
they're Ledda's girls.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.791
-Remember Ledda?
-Course.

08:43.824 --> 08:44.925
She still punching bullies?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.828
-Yeah, pretty much.
-(laughs)

08:47.861 --> 08:50.798
Well, I'm in Ohio these days.

08:50.831 --> 08:54.101
-Okay. -Recently divorced,
so that's fun.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.003
(laughs)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.705
-DANA: Um...
-Uh-huh.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.742
My daddy's sick, so I came home.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.043
I'd actually heard that.
I'm sorry.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.645
Thank you.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.815
-We should get a drink sometime,
catch up. -Oh.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.650
I'm not...
I'm not too sure about that.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.052
Um, it's, um,
it's kind of a bad time for us.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.955
Ledda's been real sick, and, uh,
it's just a bad time all around.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.124
It's just a drink, Wade.
It's not a root canal.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.628
Well...

09:20.661 --> 09:22.863
here, let me...

09:22.896 --> 09:25.666
give you this,
in case things change,

09:25.699 --> 09:28.001
-or... whatever.
-Okay. All right.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.570
-Well, I-I'll give you call.
-Okay. That'd be great. Well...

09:31.872 --> 09:33.741
-Well, it was nice to see you.
-Yep.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.008
Bye.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.013
*

09:43.416 --> 09:45.619
Thank you for coming, Bren'in.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.889
I didn't want to trouble you,
but I never seen Silas so sick.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.759
Nonsense, Eela.
You can always call on me.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.662
He were in fine fiddle
yesterday, hunting frogs,

09:54.695 --> 09:57.898
-and now look at him.
-Hi there, Silas.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.667
Hey, there's nothing
to be frightened about.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.301
I know every cure
on this mountain.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.170
All you have to do is
let me take a look at you.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.673
Can you do that?

10:07.340 --> 10:08.909
That looks nasty.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.213
-When did this start?
-This morning.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.315
Thought he might've gotten
into a poison ivy patch.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.185
No, it's not poison ivy.
It'd be weeping if it was.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.020
Where'd you say
he was hunting frogs?

10:20.053 --> 10:22.622
Sweet Allis Spring.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.733
This is bad, Krake.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.769
Real bad.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.105
*

11:02.896 --> 11:05.365
*

11:18.011 --> 11:20.247
(quiet chatter)

11:26.854 --> 11:30.190
Thank you for coming
to the council.

11:30.223 --> 11:33.060
As you know, the coal company
have poisoned our fields.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.062
Sweet Allis Spring, too.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.298
Those snakes intend
to starve us off the mountain.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.034
I've checked the cisterns,
and if we ration,

11:41.068 --> 11:43.070
we should have enough to get by.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.338
As for our crops, we're
gonna have to clear new fields

11:45.372 --> 11:47.274
and get some cold weather plants
in the ground.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.042
It's gonna be
a tough six months,

11:49.076 --> 11:51.411
-but we're gonna make it.
-SHURN: That's it?

11:51.444 --> 11:52.980
Sounds like
mighty cold soup to me.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.182
I hadn't finished yet.
The way I see it,

11:55.215 --> 11:57.751
the coal company, they have all
these people working for them.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.287
It's their job to get us off the
mountain, but they're doing it

12:00.320 --> 12:02.389
from their buildings
and their helicopters--

12:02.422 --> 12:04.391
they never see the real cost.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.326
So I think
we get one of them up here,

12:06.359 --> 12:07.828
show them the harm
they've caused

12:07.861 --> 12:09.963
and make them face us.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.498
The one in charge.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.533
They ain't gonna come willingly.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.936
I know. And they won't have to.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.370
BIG FOSTER:
Well, I'll go...

12:17.404 --> 12:18.538
Bren'in.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.042
Alone. And that way, no one
catches trouble except me

12:22.075 --> 12:24.812
-if things go belly-up.
-KRAKE: This is pure crazy.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.914
-It'll bring the law back for
sure. -G'WIN: Yeah, it might.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.448
But anything could,
and this clan cannot wait to see

12:28.481 --> 12:30.383
-what they're gonna do next.
-KRAKE: How are we gonna find

12:30.417 --> 12:33.020
one demon in a pack of devils?

12:33.053 --> 12:34.922
Hasil knows her.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.490
He showed Phil'up a wad of paper
once, said it was money from

12:37.524 --> 12:39.827
-the lady in charge. -BIG
FOSTER: Well, that settles it.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.261
I'll take the drop,
I'll get around them guards,

12:41.294 --> 12:45.032
I'll find Hasil,
and I'll go get that she-wolf.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.168
-Drop's a perilous route.
-Well, these are perilous times.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.970
Okay.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.404
All right.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.478
(Barbara giggling)

13:05.452 --> 13:07.087
BARBARA:
Hello, Foster.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.522
-You lost, old man?
-Clan's under attack,

13:09.556 --> 13:12.559
and you shirked
our council meeting for this?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.427
-Sure looks like it.
-I didn't raise you

13:14.461 --> 13:16.396
to hide under the covers.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.931
Yes, you did.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.967
The way I heard it,
when I was born,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.169
my mother was bleeding out--
where were you?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.804
Off warming Callie Shay's bed,
that right?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.207
Your ma and I,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.143
we already lost one child
'fore you.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.345
When her labor pains began,
I drank a jug

13:32.379 --> 13:33.914
of Farrell Wine, I run off.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.249
You really want to be
a fool like me?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.051
You made it look
so damn appealing,

13:38.085 --> 13:40.453
I thought
I'd try it on for size.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.990
Elon would not recognize you
like this.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.193
Well...

13:46.226 --> 13:49.429
then it's a damn good thing
that you got him killed.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.205
Elon...

13:58.238 --> 13:59.839
forgave me.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.282
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.090
Hey, Fa.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.062
-I found it.
-(laughs)

14:23.630 --> 14:25.598
SALLY-ANN:
I don't know about this, Hasil.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.535
-It's not in the budget. -Oh,
come on, it's your birthday.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.537
You said this place
is your favorite.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.540
Now, I want you to just sit down
and don't worry about a thing.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.942
WAITRESS:
Here you go.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.077
You're sweet.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.613
-Sit down.
-Okay.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.290
SALLY-ANN:
Thank you.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.492
What are you looking at?

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
Looks like I got me
a fight club fan.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.469
-(chuckles)
-Who'd you think he was?

15:02.502 --> 15:05.538
Nobody. (clears throat)

15:05.572 --> 15:08.408
Now, that looks... that
toast thing looks delicious.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.710
What do you call that?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.281
So you really aren't
gonna tell me, are you?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.416
Tell you what?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.054
Tried to convince myself that

15:21.088 --> 15:23.090
all this disguise stuff
was about fight club.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.293
You know, it being illegal
and all, but...

15:26.326 --> 15:30.430
that man just recognized you,
and you were fine with it.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.366
So you're hiding
for a different reason.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.268
'Cause you had something to do

15:35.302 --> 15:37.404
-with that prison break,
didn't you? -I... I don't...

15:37.437 --> 15:39.206
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.075
Don't do that.
Not with something this big.

15:42.109 --> 15:45.178
-All right, yeah, I did.
-We need to go.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.181
We need to go right now, because
if some guy in a restaurant

15:48.215 --> 15:50.483
can just recognize you, then it
is just a matter of time before

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
a cop does.
We need to go right now.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.220
Sit down. Sit down.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.755
We ain't going nowhere.
What are we gonna do?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.125
We gonna hide
for the rest of our lives?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.994
We need to keep moving forward
the best we can.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.429
That is, if you still want

16:02.462 --> 16:05.232
to be with me after everything
that I've done.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
You guys know what you want?

16:15.608 --> 16:18.245
(kids chattering)

16:18.278 --> 16:19.779
HOUGHTON:
Hey, Hilda.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.082
-Hey, Hilda. Shh.
-(chatter stops)

16:22.115 --> 16:23.416
Caleb, go upstairs, get changed.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.552
Then you can go outside.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.189
Jesus, Ledda,
what are you doing?

16:29.222 --> 16:31.424
-You're supposed to be in bed.
-I was visited, Wade.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.626
What are you talking about?
Visited by who?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.496
Well, a-a little boy
from the street.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.731
Uh-huh. What, like, like,
a neighborhood kid?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.733
No.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.104
I think it was Breece,
but as a child.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.673
He was on the porch
and we talked.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.080
Don't look at me like that.
I-I know it sounds weird.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.715
Yeah.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.718
Sounds like you ate
a whole bunch of Percocets,

16:58.751 --> 17:00.420
is what it sounds like.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.555
Yeah, you'd know all about that,
wouldn't you?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.158
Sorry.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.360
I know that it was him.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.230
Look! (laughs)

17:10.263 --> 17:12.365
HOUGHTON:
Oh.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.168
-Yeah. -Look, I know
what you're gonna say.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.336
That I'm nuts.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.338
And maybe I am.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.308
But he came back
to comfort me, Wade.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.576
He doesn't want me to be scared.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.711
Okay.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.579
I believe you.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.123
(phone ringing)

17:39.459 --> 17:41.428
-Haylie Grimes speaking.
-WOMAN: Morning, Ms. Grimes.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.530
This is Anna Dutch
with the Lexington Gazette.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.733
-Do you have a minute? -I always
have time for the press, Anna.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.435
Well, I'm calling
regarding an e-mail

17:48.468 --> 17:50.370
sent to us anonymously
this morning

17:50.403 --> 17:52.205
-regarding your company.
-Go on.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.840
It's between Don Foushee
and the governor

17:53.873 --> 17:56.109
confirming that One Planet
would give him

17:56.143 --> 18:00.380
a sizeable campaign contribution
contingent upon the hiring

18:00.413 --> 18:02.315
of Matt Meyers.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.384
Well, I can tell you
with absolute certainty

18:04.417 --> 18:06.553
I have no knowledge
of any such e-mail.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.655
Really?
Well, you were cc'd on it.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.258
-Care to comment?
-I would.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.260
No comment.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.476
Well, it ain't gonna taste
like honey mead,

18:29.509 --> 18:32.212
but this is the strongest
medicine I got for Silas.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.914
-Is that white oak bark ready?
-I sliced it up real thin.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.116
Thank you.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.888
You should take a rest.

18:41.921 --> 18:45.192
-Been at it all morning.
-I'm fine, it's nothing.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.726
Don't be pigheaded, Bren'in.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.861
Doesn't help anyone.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.730
Especially not the baby.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.770
Does everyone know?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.872
Don't imagine so.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.941
Been hiding it real well.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.443
Well, that's a relief.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.516
Do you know whose it is?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.152
I do.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.391
It's mine.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.760
*

19:47.354 --> 19:49.656
*

20:13.946 --> 20:16.383
*

20:32.599 --> 20:33.733
(engine starts)

20:47.614 --> 20:50.850
*

21:01.027 --> 21:02.995
(exhales)

21:10.370 --> 21:12.372
*

21:24.917 --> 21:26.619
Miss?

21:26.653 --> 21:29.389
-Ah! You get away from me!
-Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.623
You don't got no worries,
all right?

21:30.657 --> 21:31.691
I got business with Hasil only.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.626
Hey. You found him.

21:33.660 --> 21:34.894
Oh.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.796
(chuckles):
Oh, my.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.898
(chuckles)
Somebody gonna play dress-up.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.500
You're a dandy now.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.535
Well, I guess that
makes two of us, then.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.103
Oh, you are funny, yes, you are.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.005
Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.441
-No, we're not going anywhere
with you. -Okay.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.711
You may not be, but he is. Go.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.713
It's all right. Come on.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.661
BIG FOSTER:
We need to get her,

22:08.695 --> 22:10.430
so she can see
the damage they've done.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.799
Taking that woman
seems ill-advised.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.101
I mean, it's-it's dangerous
right now.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.369
Exactly.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.370
You want me to deliver
that message

22:17.404 --> 22:18.371
to Silas Shay?

22:18.405 --> 22:21.841
Maybe his mother.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.743
Well?

22:23.776 --> 22:23.976
Look...

22:25.545 --> 22:27.614
we need you, Hasil Farrell.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.115
SALLY-ANN:
That's it! I've heard enough.

22:29.148 --> 22:29.949
I want him gone.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.852
-Okay. Hey, just-just...
-All right.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.120
I'm handling this.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.755
-All right?
-How?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.023
When is all of this craziness
gonna stop?

22:37.056 --> 22:39.025
We have been going
from one crisis to the next,

22:39.058 --> 22:41.428
and now you are talking about
kidnapping somebody!

22:41.461 --> 22:43.029
Ain't no harm gonna come
to that woman.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.598
Just-- (stammers) ain't no harm
gonna come to her.

22:45.632 --> 22:47.600
I need to help, Sally-Ann.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.769
All right? I am a Farrell.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.837
BIG FOSTER:
Ged-gedyah.

22:56.509 --> 22:57.877
I see what it is.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.045
Come on.

23:00.647 --> 23:04.083
No, you don't.
No, you don't.

23:04.116 --> 23:08.054
Listen to me.
I am also your family.

23:08.087 --> 23:10.056
All right,
but there are too many people

23:10.089 --> 23:12.091
who do not want my kin to exist,

23:12.124 --> 23:14.561
and I will not stop
fighting that.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.731
Stop what you're doing
and look at me.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.735
I will always come back to you.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.505
But you got to understand
that this is the way

23:25.538 --> 23:26.839
that my life is gonna be,

23:26.873 --> 23:28.908
and you need to choose
with honest eyes.

23:28.941 --> 23:31.077
Then you need to choose
my complicated life, too.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.012
'Cause you are not the only one
who has to make hard choices.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.847
-I know that...
-Ah, excuse me,

23:34.881 --> 23:37.750
but we got bigger fish to fry
than all this feeling talk.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.085
Can we get a move on?

23:44.724 --> 23:46.493
I'll be back for you.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.097
(door closes)

23:51.130 --> 23:53.766
This is utterly ridiculous,

23:53.800 --> 23:56.836
making you come in on a weekend
for this farce.

23:56.869 --> 24:00.607
There's no way I'm the source
of that e-mail leak.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.576
Our diagnostics show otherwise.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.213
That e-mail definitely
originated from your account.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.649
Well, that is impossible.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.184
(chuckles): Why would I do
something like that?

24:12.218 --> 24:14.220
I was a bridesmaid
at Don Foushee's wedding,

24:14.253 --> 24:15.688
for God's sake.

24:15.722 --> 24:16.923
Did anyone have access
to your computer

24:16.956 --> 24:18.558
other than yourself,
Ms. Grimes?

24:18.591 --> 24:21.160
No, I take cyber-security
extremely seriously.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.062
Did you bring your laptop?

24:32.805 --> 24:35.274
Again, no one had access
to this machine

24:35.307 --> 24:37.076
other than yourself, correct?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.511
No.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.616
Of course not.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.304
(line ringing)

25:05.337 --> 25:08.174
GORDON: Namaste. You've reached
Gordon Jerrod's voice mail.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.977
-You know what to do.
-(line beeps)

25:19.886 --> 25:21.821
Thank you.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.990
(sighs)

25:24.023 --> 25:26.659
Nurse says the doctor will be in
about ten minutes.

25:26.693 --> 25:29.295
He said that ten minutes ago.
I hate hospitals.

25:29.328 --> 25:32.198
I know you do, but, Ledda,
you got to get another CAT scan.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.866
You don't have to
have any treatment;

25:33.900 --> 25:36.302
we just need to know what's
going on so that we can...

25:36.335 --> 25:38.771
-make arrangements.
-I want to be cremated.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.206
Ledda, I'm not saying right now.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.775
I'm saying... in time.

25:42.809 --> 25:45.044
Goddamn.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.847
Hey, Hilda told me
about Dana Miller.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.884
-Said she was real cute.
-Yeah, well,

25:51.918 --> 25:54.621
her dad's sick, so she's here
taking care of him.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.088
-She said you were flirting.
-What?

25:56.122 --> 25:57.256
-Yeah.
-Hilda said

25:57.289 --> 25:59.659
-I was flirting with her?
-Mm-hmm.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.127
What made her say that?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.796
She said that you, uh,
smiled twice

26:03.830 --> 26:05.297
and that you laughed once.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.799
I was just being polite.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.200
Oh, is that it?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.036
Well...

26:10.069 --> 26:13.239
she did, uh, give me her card.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.341
-You gonna take advantage
of that? -You serious?

26:15.374 --> 26:17.376
With everything that's going on?

26:17.409 --> 26:19.979
Wade, pretty soon,
you're gonna be a single man

26:20.012 --> 26:21.280
with three children.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.382
What a catch, huh?

26:23.415 --> 26:25.284
Yeah, that's my point.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.119
You should call her.

26:31.390 --> 26:34.093
(men grunting)

26:46.739 --> 26:48.007
MAN:
(grunts) Just...

26:48.040 --> 26:50.710
I'm gonna grab it. (grunts)

26:50.743 --> 26:51.711
(man laughing)

26:53.112 --> 26:54.246
Barnabis?

26:54.280 --> 26:56.348
You seen Lil Foster?

26:56.382 --> 26:59.351
Uh, no, Bren'in.

26:59.385 --> 27:01.353
Well, anyone laid eyes on him?

27:01.387 --> 27:04.791
Trevor and, uh,
Phil'up said that, uh,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.793
he's been up in his teepee
all day.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.027
Well, he unwell?

27:08.060 --> 27:09.862
No, I don't think so.

27:09.896 --> 27:11.263
He's just--

27:11.297 --> 27:13.065
-he's busy.
-Doing what?

27:13.099 --> 27:15.702
Uh, mm, Barb-Barbara...

27:15.735 --> 27:17.937
Right. I see.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.873
All respect, uh, Bren'in, uh,

27:20.907 --> 27:23.442
he did just get out of prison.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.277
Oh, and you think that's
an excuse to abandon his family

27:25.311 --> 27:26.378
in their greatest time of need?

27:26.412 --> 27:28.014
I guess not.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.415
-You can go.
-All right.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.354
(train bell ringing,
horn blowing)

27:39.826 --> 27:41.327
Hey.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.429
-Hey.
-What are you drinking?

27:43.462 --> 27:44.931
That depends.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.266
You haven't returned my calls
all day.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.301
-Why'd you ask me here?
-To reassure you.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.704
I don't suspect you
of leaking that e-mail.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.940
(sighs) Thank God.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.341
You know,
I've been thinking about it.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.043
-Mm.
-I had to have been hacked.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.912
-It was probably in some
coffee shop with Wi-Fi. -Mm-hmm.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.915
Can I get a pinot noir if
you got it, merlot if you don't.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.017
Other people might think
you had something to do with it,

28:05.051 --> 28:07.053
but I don't want you worrying
about me.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.387
-Other people?
-I just keep thinking

28:08.420 --> 28:10.489
who would do something
like this?

28:10.522 --> 28:13.392
Trust me, Matt, if I knew that,
I'd buy this whole bar a round.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.094
You don't think anybody
in Mountain Witness?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.029
Uh, an escalation
from the parade?

28:17.063 --> 28:18.264
No, I don't think so.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.899
-Have you seen their Web site?
-Mm-mm.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.401
-Makes Craigslist look flashy.
-(both laugh)

28:22.434 --> 28:24.771
No, I don't think
they have the skill set.

28:24.804 --> 28:28.140
Mm, true. But I just,
I have this feeling in my gut...

28:28.174 --> 28:30.242
I wonder who might be
sympathetic to their cause.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.345
I have no idea.
Certainly not me.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.448
Although, you did backdate
Breece Dobbs's paperwork

28:36.482 --> 28:39.118
so Ledda could
get health insurance.

28:39.151 --> 28:44.156
That seems a bit sympathetic,
don't you think?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.793
It's called
having a heart, Matt.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.195
Thanks for letting me know
I'm being watched.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.799
Oh, you don't have to do that.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.266
Oh, I do.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.935
My daddy always said,

28:55.968 --> 28:57.536
if you're gonna drink
with the enemy,

28:57.569 --> 28:59.738
make damn sure
you're the one who's paying.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.113
I gave up motherhood and
my marriage for this company,

29:07.146 --> 29:08.948
and I will crawl over glass

29:08.981 --> 29:11.417
before I let a man like you
play games with me.

29:23.495 --> 29:27.800
Well... (chuckles)
to old friends.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.243
A-Are you waiting
for its permission or...?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.544
I'm not much of a drinker.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.313
Well, you-you certainly aren't.
(laughs)

29:41.347 --> 29:42.982
Well, it's better that way.

29:43.015 --> 29:44.917
At least I know
you're not an alcoholic.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.819
Yeah.

29:46.853 --> 29:48.054
You know, I have to say, I was,

29:48.087 --> 29:49.856
I was really surprised
that you called.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.358
Oh, yeah, my-my sister thought
it'd be a good idea.

29:52.391 --> 29:56.028
Hmm. Just what every woman
wants to hear.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.564
(laughs) Oh, but either way,

29:58.597 --> 30:00.532
I have been going stir-crazy
up at that house,

30:00.566 --> 30:02.902
so it's really nice
to see a familiar face.

30:02.935 --> 30:05.604
I'm surprised that you,
uh, recognized me.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.207
How could I not?

30:08.240 --> 30:10.209
You have the same eyes.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.610
We all have the same eyes,
don't we?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.145
You always this good
at taking a compliment?

30:13.179 --> 30:14.947
-Yeah, pretty much.
-(both laugh)

30:14.981 --> 30:16.482
Yeah, I know.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.150
You know what else I remember?

30:18.184 --> 30:20.519
I remember when you were
a little boy telling me

30:20.552 --> 30:22.521
that you were gonna be
a policeman.

30:22.554 --> 30:25.958
Look at you now, the sheriff.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.260
Seems like you're doing
real well for yourself.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.930
Yeah, I mean,
it might look that way.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.965
You know, uh, I mean, I--
it's funny, isn't it?

30:32.999 --> 30:34.566
I mean, I think

30:34.600 --> 30:38.070
when you're young, you know,
you have these ideas, you know,

30:38.104 --> 30:39.505
like, you got plans
about what you want to do,

30:39.538 --> 30:42.641
then you realize
that life is really just

30:42.674 --> 30:44.443
playing the hand
that you were dealt.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.947
Like, you know, you remember
how my-my dad died?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.181
Yeah, I remember.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.516
And right after that,
my mom died.

30:50.549 --> 30:53.953
And then, you know,
my wife died.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.925
My brother--
my brother-in-law died.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.326
Now my sister's dying.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.593
I'm so sorry, Wade.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.896
I can't even imagine.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.665
It's nobody's fault. It's just
one of those things, you know.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.636
I mean,
I'm the last one standing, so...

31:13.205 --> 31:14.907
...maybe it's mine.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.411
Will you excuse me for a moment?

31:21.948 --> 31:23.916
(panting)

31:27.086 --> 31:28.087
(sighs)

31:33.625 --> 31:35.594
(panting)

31:40.132 --> 31:41.433
(Hasil sighs)

31:41.467 --> 31:43.135
BIG FOSTER:
You sure she's coming?

31:43.169 --> 31:44.636
We been waiting
since the sun set,

31:44.670 --> 31:46.605
and all I've seen
is lard-ass families.

31:46.638 --> 31:50.109
Mm-hmm, this is where she lives.
She's got to come back sometime.

31:52.044 --> 31:55.081
Don't take me wrong,
but you look...

31:55.114 --> 31:57.149
damn ridiculous
dressed like that.

32:00.186 --> 32:03.422
We can just sit here quiet.
Don't need to talk.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.224
You really think you can live
in two worlds?

32:05.257 --> 32:07.960
Well, I have to
if I want to see Sally-Ann.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.728
Well, she's a little something,
but don't tell me

32:09.761 --> 32:11.730
there ain't five Farrell women

32:11.763 --> 32:13.699
just as ready to step out
with you.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.535
Maybe so, but ain't none of 'em
gonna have my baby.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.007
I want this kid
to know both his parents,

32:21.040 --> 32:23.042
so I got to dress the part.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.644
I can't believe it.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.546
You are gonna be a daddy.

32:30.116 --> 32:31.483
What's it like?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.485
Well...

32:35.521 --> 32:37.323
I probably ain't
the best one to ask,

32:37.356 --> 32:40.159
but sometimes it feels like...

32:42.194 --> 32:45.497
...you'll never do
anything better in your life.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.499
That all your good is in them.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.045
HASIL:
That's her.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.047
This ain't gonna take
two shakes.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.534
*

33:31.143 --> 33:32.778
(brakes squeal softly)

33:41.487 --> 33:42.654
Hasil?

33:42.688 --> 33:44.156
Is that you?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.691
Yeah, uh...

33:45.724 --> 33:47.726
sorry.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.128
(muffled screaming)

33:49.161 --> 33:50.562
(Big Foster grunts)

33:50.596 --> 33:51.797
(screaming)

33:57.769 --> 34:00.172
-(muffled screaming)
-(pounding on trunk)

34:00.206 --> 34:01.107
(tires screeching)

34:03.575 --> 34:05.811
HOUGHTON:
I have to apologize to you.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.814
Uh... it's been a long day.

34:08.847 --> 34:11.617
-You do not need to explain.
-No, no, I do.

34:11.650 --> 34:14.420
You know, I met Andi-Rae
when I was still in high school,

34:14.453 --> 34:18.224
so I-I never really been
on a date before, you know,

34:18.257 --> 34:19.758
so I-I didn't know what to do.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.361
Crying's not generally
advised, but...

34:22.394 --> 34:24.663
-I-I heard that. Yeah.
-(laughs)

34:24.696 --> 34:26.532
I understand.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.735
Moving on is hard.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.104
This is my first date
since my divorce,

34:32.138 --> 34:35.407
and I nearly gonna puked driving
over here, I was so nervous.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.443
That's good. I mean, I'm...

34:37.476 --> 34:38.810
I'm glad it wasn't just me.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.712
(chuckles)

34:40.746 --> 34:43.349
Well...

34:43.382 --> 34:45.351
-This your car? Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:45.384 --> 34:47.119
-I got it.
-Oh, thanks.

34:49.355 --> 34:50.722
Well, you should call me.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.391
You know, we could...

34:52.424 --> 34:54.593
-we could have a do-over.
-Okay.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.828
I mean, hell, the way things
are going with my daddy,

34:56.862 --> 34:59.765
it'll probably be my turn
to cry next, so...

34:59.798 --> 35:01.567
Uh...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.302
(quietly):
Well...

35:03.335 --> 35:04.670
-It was nice seeing you.
-You, too.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.305
-Okay.
-Good night.

35:20.586 --> 35:23.689
Well, hello, Wade Houghton.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.856
Mm.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.562
-(Haylie grunts)
-(pounding on trunk)

35:30.596 --> 35:32.198
(muffled screaming)

35:32.231 --> 35:34.566
BIG FOSTER:
God, she don't give up, do she?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.402
Will you shut up back there?!

35:36.435 --> 35:37.669
(screaming continues)

35:39.538 --> 35:41.607
Hey, pull over, over here.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.581
Thank you.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.317
BIG FOSTER: You don't have to
do this, you know.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.186
Come on home. Bring your girl.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.388
I'll make things right
with the elders.

35:56.422 --> 35:58.524
And that'll be my sorry to you.

35:58.557 --> 35:59.758
How's that sound?

35:59.791 --> 36:01.227
Well, it sounds like
you fell down,

36:01.260 --> 36:02.828
hit your head,
and woke up a new man.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.264
Maybe we both did.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.565
Yeah.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.502
Foster Farrell VI.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.341
That's fair.

36:17.443 --> 36:20.312
HAYLIE:
Hello?

36:20.346 --> 36:22.314
-(Haylie screaming)
-(pounding on trunk)

36:31.557 --> 36:34.593
All right, everybody say
"strip sticks" on three.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.794
One, two, three.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.964
-Strip...
-(laughter)

36:40.532 --> 36:41.700
What you got for that one?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.302
Lucky for me, bad for you.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.803
(laughter)

36:44.836 --> 36:47.339
Mm. Mm.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.476
(whistles)

36:50.509 --> 36:52.644
That's you. (chuckles)

36:52.678 --> 36:53.845
Come on! Take it off.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.781
Every time.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.620
(woman giggles)

37:04.356 --> 37:05.757
LIL FOSTER:
Hello, Bren'in.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.659
You care to join us?

37:07.693 --> 37:09.428
Can I talk to you?

37:09.461 --> 37:11.330
Outside?

37:11.363 --> 37:12.831
What are you doing?

37:12.864 --> 37:15.801
Well, up until
a couple of minutes ago,

37:15.834 --> 37:18.537
I guess I was
in this here teepee,

37:18.570 --> 37:20.272
about to get naked with
beau-beautiful women.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.940
I don't even know
who you are right now.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.276
Your kin is suffering.
They need you.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.977
Need me to what?

37:26.011 --> 37:29.014
Need me to farm a bunch of roots
that I wouldn't give to a pig?

37:29.047 --> 37:31.650
Or convince them
that kidnapping a coal devil,

37:31.683 --> 37:34.786
bringing him up here,
that's a great idea.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.822
Okay, well, what in your
humble opinion, Foster,

37:36.855 --> 37:38.390
would be a good idea?

37:38.424 --> 37:41.827
Nothing.

37:41.860 --> 37:45.631
There ain't no point
in fighting.

37:45.664 --> 37:49.568
People down there, they got guns
that they ain't afraid to use.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.703
They got ways of
getting in your head

37:51.737 --> 37:53.505
and twisting up your insides.

37:53.539 --> 37:56.675
So, in the meantime,
I think that us Farrells

37:56.708 --> 38:01.347
should dance, make love

38:01.380 --> 38:06.518
and drink in all this beauty
before it all goes to shit,

38:06.552 --> 38:08.987
and us right along with it,
how about that?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.656
That's what I think.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.859
I heard someone say
you been having nightmares.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.861
I know what that's like.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.866
What happened to you in prison?

38:23.869 --> 38:26.037
I killed a man.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.107
I killed a man.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.477
(chuckles)

38:31.510 --> 38:33.845
We done here?

38:33.879 --> 38:35.914
'Cause I'm done talking to you.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.650
So that's it?

38:38.684 --> 38:40.719
They are poisoning our children,

38:40.752 --> 38:42.388
and you're not gonna
fight for us?

38:42.421 --> 38:45.391
Why should I?

38:45.424 --> 38:48.026
Tell me one reason why I should.

38:49.695 --> 38:54.065
Watching you marry my Fa
taught me one thing:

38:54.099 --> 38:58.069
some things just ain't
worth fighting for.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.511
SALLY-ANN: "Turtles swim,
and moths do fly.

39:05.544 --> 39:08.780
-How many animals can you spy?"
-(door opens)

39:11.550 --> 39:14.085
Bright lizards creep,

39:14.119 --> 39:16.788
and little snails crawl.

39:16.822 --> 39:20.592
Living in harmony,

39:20.626 --> 39:22.594
one and all.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.699
I want to go back to school.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.036
I was studying before I met you,
and I miss it.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.572
All right.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.841
And I want you to stop
hiding things from me.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.609
All right.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.778
Okay.

39:44.983 --> 39:47.118
What are you doing?

39:49.555 --> 39:51.523
I was reading the baby
a bedtime story.

39:51.557 --> 39:52.858
Mm.

39:58.163 --> 40:01.099
Keep going. (chuckles)

40:01.132 --> 40:03.902
I'll start over.

40:03.935 --> 40:07.439
"Turtles swim,
and moths do fly."

40:07.473 --> 40:09.174
Which one is "turtles"?

40:09.207 --> 40:10.809
SALLY-ANN:
It's this word, the "T."

40:10.842 --> 40:12.110
-HASIL: That's the "T"?
-Mm-hmm.

40:12.143 --> 40:13.512
-"T"?
-Mm-hmm.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.913
-There's "T."
-That "T"?

40:14.946 --> 40:16.848
There's another one. (giggles)

40:16.882 --> 40:20.018
HASIL: This reading thing
ain't gonna be so hard.

40:20.051 --> 40:23.421
SALLY-ANN:
Maybe not. (laughs)

40:34.265 --> 40:36.067
Just so you know,

40:36.101 --> 40:38.103
I could've called the police,
but I didn't.

40:38.136 --> 40:39.538
I'm a friend of the Farrells.

40:39.571 --> 40:40.806
Good.

40:40.839 --> 40:43.208
Let's go for a walk.
Huh? Friend?

40:43.241 --> 40:44.209
(Haylie screaming)

40:44.242 --> 40:45.977
Get off!

40:49.014 --> 40:51.917
Ow! Ow! (screaming)

40:51.950 --> 40:53.485
Let go of me!

40:53.519 --> 40:54.686
Help!

40:54.720 --> 40:56.187
Help me!

41:03.629 --> 41:05.697
Ledda, you seen my sunglasses
down there?

41:05.731 --> 41:08.700
(Ledda crying in distance)

41:08.734 --> 41:11.069
Ledda?

41:12.137 --> 41:13.171
Ledda?

41:14.239 --> 41:15.707
Ledda.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.077
(Ledda continues crying)

41:20.846 --> 41:22.814
What is it?

41:22.848 --> 41:24.683
What's the matter?

41:26.718 --> 41:28.687
The hospital called.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.157
Okay.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.959
What they say?

41:39.665 --> 41:41.299
I'm in remission.

41:41.332 --> 41:44.169
What are you talking about?

41:44.202 --> 41:46.271
Are you joking with me?

41:46.304 --> 41:47.806
(laughs):
No.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.975
-How?
-I don't know.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.810
I stopped listening
after they told me

41:51.843 --> 41:54.746
that the cancer was going away.

42:00.786 --> 42:02.087
Goddamn.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.027
-What happened?
-The medicine helped,

42:09.060 --> 42:11.296
but then, in the night,
he took a turn.

42:11.329 --> 42:12.864
(Silas groaning)

42:12.898 --> 42:15.266
I don't understand.

42:24.810 --> 42:26.211
I'm sorry, Eela.

42:26.244 --> 42:32.984
EELA:
* My boy went a-wandering

42:33.018 --> 42:37.155
* Full of hope
and pure of heart *

42:38.690 --> 42:44.696
* He drank from
the sweet spring *

42:44.730 --> 42:49.234
(voice breaks):
* Which forced his spirit

42:49.267 --> 42:51.236
* To depart.

42:58.977 --> 43:02.247
I'm a woman of peace.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.950
But the time for peace is over.

43:04.983 --> 43:07.318
We got that
coal boss coming up here.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.688
And her fate
will be tied to ours.

43:09.721 --> 43:12.390
She will sit at our table.

43:12.423 --> 43:15.126
She will eat our food.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.462
And she will drink our water.

43:21.332 --> 43:23.234
-Go on, go, go, go.
-Ah!

43:25.036 --> 43:26.872
-Come on.
-Ow!

43:26.905 --> 43:28.106
All right, that is it.

43:28.139 --> 43:29.675
I'm not going one more step.

43:29.708 --> 43:31.142
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not,

43:31.176 --> 43:32.711
you pathetic, deranged hippie.

43:32.744 --> 43:34.646
Ow! Ow!

43:34.680 --> 43:36.715
(grunting) Let me go!

43:36.748 --> 43:40.251
(screams)
Let me go!
