in the streets?

30:42.174 --> 30:44.484
That's a marketing nightmare.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.650
And it's probably why all
the other labels have passed.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.296

wanna be entertained.

30:53.952 --> 30:56.057

the lyrics to the song.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.726
But also with people
wanting to be entertained,

30:58.824 --> 31:00.303
there are people
that wanna be heard.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.700
And that's where I come in.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.104

from the streets.

31:03.128 --> 31:04.971

31:05.030 --> 31:06.474
on what's going on out here,
all right?

31:06.498 --> 31:09.502
Do you know
where Brenda came from?

31:10.502 --> 31:11.640
<i>The New York Post.</i>

31:11.903 --> 31:13.644
Every day,
I read about that story,

31:13.705 --> 31:17.152
and every day, that story
got smaller and smaller.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.052
You know why?
'Cause it's the hood

31:19.144 --> 31:21.647
and white America don't give
a shit about the hood.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.159
Now, we understand that there
are issues in the inner-city.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.389
There ain't no inner-city,
Ted. It's the outer-city.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.327
You know why'?

31:27.386 --> 31:29.024
'Cause we're left
out of everything.

31:29.187 --> 31:30.187
When you're born,

31:30.222 --> 31:32.429
you're born into a dynasty
or an empire.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.098
Our family crest is cotton.

31:37.262 --> 31:38.866
We don't have
no family heirlooms.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.440

that we can leave behind
