lost track of time.

21:10.968 --> 21:12.968
Yeah.
Is he parking or something?

21:12.968 --> 21:14.367
No, no. He's, uh--

21:14.367 --> 21:17.334
I talked him into letting us
take you out to dinner.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.901
Just the three of us?

21:19.901 --> 21:21.100
Yeah.
Yup.

21:21.100 --> 21:22.634
And--
And then we were thinking

21:22.634 --> 21:24.701
maybe you'd like to spend
the night at our place.

21:24.701 --> 21:26.200
Yeah.
How does that sound?

21:26.200 --> 21:29.467
Okay. But--

21:29.467 --> 21:31.868
Maybe-- Maybe I should
just check in with Bailey.

21:31.868 --> 21:33.667
You know, make sure he doesn't--

21:33.667 --> 21:36.167
He doesn't feel like
I'm deserting him or something.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.100
Oh,
I wouldn't do that.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.801
No. He was gonna go out.

21:39.801 --> 21:43.400
What's going on?

21:43.400 --> 21:45.434
Why isn't Bailey going with us?

21:45.434 --> 21:47.300
Well, like I said,
sweetie, he's--

21:47.300 --> 21:50.534
Never mind. I know why.

21:50.534 --> 21:53.167
He was drinking again,
wasn't he?

21:54.601 --> 21:55.901
Wasn't he?

21:57.701 --> 21:59.267
Look, it doesn't make it
any easier

21:59.267 --> 22:02.334
when someone doesn't
tell you the truth.

22:02.334 --> 22:05.734
It just makes that sick feeling
in your stomach worse.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.434
He'd been drinking,
yes.

22:11.334 --> 22:13.434
He promised.

22:17.634 --> 22:20.501
Do you realize
how much work this is gonna be?

22:20.501 --> 22:22.734
Uh-huh. But I already
told him that I'd buy it, so...

22:22.734 --> 22:25.267
That is an oral agreement
subject to inspection

22:25.267 --> 22:27.634
and God knows what else.
That is totally non-binding.

22:27.634 --> 22:30.601
You can get out of it.
I don't want to get out of it.

22:30.601 --> 22:32.267
Oh, yeah. Okay.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.868
So why don't you
tell me what his

22:33.868 --> 22:36.400
average monthly net profit is.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.334
He brings in three
or four grand easy.

22:38.334 --> 22:40.467
That's gross.
What's gross about it?

22:40.467 --> 22:42.801
That's good money.
No. Gross income.

22:42.801 --> 22:45.868
Total. You have to subtract
the expenses to get the net.

22:45.868 --> 22:47.100
Net profit, you know?

22:47.100 --> 22:50.167
After payroll, parts, insurance,
mortgage, taxes.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.267
Oh, I don't know.

22:52.267 --> 22:54.200
Griffin,
you're buying a business here,

22:54.200 --> 22:56.801
not deodorant.
Didn't you ask him anything?

22:56.801 --> 22:58.801
Yes. Yeah, sure, I asked him.

22:58.801 --> 23:01.200
I asked him things like, uh,
I don't know--

23:01.200 --> 23:02.367
how much business he gets.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.267
He says that he stays busy
all the time, so...

23:04.267 --> 23:06.200
There was no one in there
the other day.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.067
We were, like, it.
It was, like, 2:00 on a weekday.

23:09.067 --> 23:11.133
On a Saturday you can't even
get near that place.

23:11.133 --> 23:12.734
I know, I've been there.

23:12.734 --> 23:15.167
Okay. Okay.

23:15.167 --> 23:17.367
So does he own
or rent the building?

23:17.367 --> 23:19.868
'Cause if he rents, you need
to know the terms of the lease.

23:19.868 --> 23:22.467
If he owns, you need to know the
market value of the property.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.767
Look, I'm gonna have Arnie
take care of all that stuff.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.868
All right?
What's with you anyway?

23:26.868 --> 23:28.400
You know, this is a good thing.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.801
You should be excited for me.

23:29.801 --> 23:31.567
I am.

23:31.567 --> 23:34.067
I am. It's just--

23:34.067 --> 23:36.300
What do you know
about running a business?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.601
I know that I can do it.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.734
God, I just feel like
a 300-pound weight

23:49.734 --> 23:51.200
has been lifted
off my shoulders.

23:51.200 --> 23:53.000
Yeah. I bet you would.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.434
I mean, Dr. Siegel was right
about the stress

23:56.434 --> 23:57.868
causing a hormonal imbalance.

23:57.868 --> 23:59.801
Of course the test results
were wacky.

23:59.801 --> 24:02.501
I mean,
look at my life right now.

24:02.501 --> 24:04.868
Anyway, what a relief, huh?

24:04.868 --> 24:07.968
Relief? Yeah.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.801
And all I could think about
was what if, you know?

24:10.801 --> 24:13.534
And I kept trying
to put it out of my mind.

24:13.534 --> 24:14.901
But I'm doing these interviews,

24:14.901 --> 24:16.501
and lobbying
with possible donors.

24:16.501 --> 24:19.167
And it was like this thing
hanging over my head

24:19.167 --> 24:21.734
the whole time.
I mean, God, can you imagine?

24:21.734 --> 24:24.367
Oh, and, Charlie,
yesterday at the doctor's,

24:24.367 --> 24:26.834
the fact that you would--
You were great.

24:26.834 --> 24:29.267
You were just great.

24:29.267 --> 24:32.601
I mean it. Thank you.

24:32.601 --> 24:33.901
[SIGHS]

24:33.901 --> 24:36.467
Anyway, thank God it's not
an issue, right?

24:36.467 --> 24:38.601
We should celebrate.

24:38.601 --> 24:41.300
Oh, did I tell you Dr. Siegel's
putting me on the pill?

24:41.300 --> 24:44.033
Some new dosage,
low estrogen or something.

24:44.033 --> 24:46.601
So this will never
happen again.

24:46.601 --> 24:49.367
Yeah, you mentioned that.

24:50.801 --> 24:53.534
Can you just clear away
the coffee and stuff?

24:55.400 --> 24:58.200
Do you need me
to order you some more?

24:58.200 --> 25:00.534
No.

25:00.534 --> 25:02.701
Oh. Wait, wait, wait.

25:02.701 --> 25:05.534
Here is the key
to the minibar.

25:05.534 --> 25:07.801
We-- We won't be needing
it anymore.

25:07.801 --> 25:10.367
And if one of us calls
to get the bar restocked,

25:10.367 --> 25:13.234
can you just make sure
that no one does that?

25:14.133 --> 25:16.300
Uh, sure.

25:22.534 --> 25:24.234
You think you
embarrassed me enough?

25:24.234 --> 25:25.601
No.

25:25.601 --> 25:27.834
Okay. Come on, sweetheart.
You better get ready.

25:27.834 --> 25:30.000
That picture-taking thing
is in less than an hour.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.400
I'm not going.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.667
I canceled.

25:35.667 --> 25:36.767
Claudia.

25:36.767 --> 25:39.033
What?
Like we're really gonna go?

25:39.033 --> 25:40.901
It's a whole reception,
Bailey.

25:40.901 --> 25:44.534
Okay? There'll probably be
beer there. Okay? And wine.

25:44.534 --> 25:46.033
Well, then,
I won't go in with you.

25:46.033 --> 25:47.534
I'll just drop you off.
Oh, right.

25:47.534 --> 25:49.133
That's better.
I'll have a great time

25:49.133 --> 25:51.100
worrying if you're somewhere
getting drunk.

25:51.100 --> 25:53.968
I'm not gonna go get drunk,
Claudia.

25:53.968 --> 25:56.734
Look, I slipped up. Okay?

25:56.734 --> 26:00.667
People slip up,
but it's not like--

26:00.667 --> 26:03.834
At least I'm admitting it.
Right?

26:03.834 --> 26:05.934
And that's the most
important thing right now,

26:05.934 --> 26:09.701
because I'm definitely not
kidding myself anymore.

26:09.701 --> 26:11.000
And you know what?

26:12.634 --> 26:15.868
This is actually--
This is probably the best thing

26:15.868 --> 26:17.334
that could've happened to me.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.167
'Cause here I am
for the past two weeks,

26:19.167 --> 26:22.434
and all I can think about
is I need a drink.

26:22.434 --> 26:24.901
I gotta have a drink.
Because if I have a drink,

26:24.901 --> 26:26.234
then everything that is wrong,

26:26.234 --> 26:30.100
and everything that is making me
feel bad will go away.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.267
Well, I had a drink,

26:32.267 --> 26:35.234
and it wasn't that great.

26:35.234 --> 26:37.067
And it didn't make me
feel better.

26:37.067 --> 26:38.968
So now I know that,

26:38.968 --> 26:42.067
and maybe I needed

26:42.067 --> 26:43.334
to go through that so--

26:43.334 --> 26:44.901
Claudia.

26:53.634 --> 26:56.534
So I-- I was thinking,
there's still, like,

26:56.534 --> 26:59.767
four days left
of spring break.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.434
And I figured it'd be totally
stupid to just stay here

27:02.434 --> 27:05.801
and waste the entire vacation.
You know?

27:07.133 --> 27:09.767
Mm-hm.

27:09.767 --> 27:13.734
So I think--
Well, more like I've--

27:13.734 --> 27:16.267
I've decided I'm--
I'm gonna go.

27:16.267 --> 27:19.000
I'm just gonna get in my car
and drive.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.701
Do it the way we planned, you
know, no reservations, no maps.

27:22.701 --> 27:25.167
Yeah. Okay.

27:26.734 --> 27:28.767
Okay?

27:28.767 --> 27:32.767
So-- So wait.
You don't mind?

27:32.767 --> 27:34.834
Well, no.

27:34.834 --> 27:37.000
I mean, what's the point of you
hanging around here?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.934
I mean, this stuff's gotta be
totally boring to you, right?

27:39.934 --> 27:42.601
You might as well go out
and have some fun.

27:42.601 --> 27:44.200
That's funny.
I kind of thought

27:44.200 --> 27:46.434
I was supposed to be
having fun with you.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.467
It's only one road trip,
Julia.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.200
Is that all?

27:55.167 --> 27:58.434
Griffin, this isn't--

27:58.434 --> 28:01.434
This isn't what I expected.

28:01.434 --> 28:05.400
And-- And I don't
just mean the trip.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.834
I mean, this is--
This is a preview, isn't it?

28:07.834 --> 28:09.434
Of how things
are gonna be for us.

28:09.434 --> 28:11.601
I mean, I--
I thought with you coming back

28:11.601 --> 28:13.300
and me not going to college
we were gonna

28:13.300 --> 28:14.901
do this thing together.
You know?

28:14.901 --> 28:16.801
We are.

28:18.133 --> 28:20.000
Are we?

28:20.000 --> 28:21.667
Are we? 'Cause now--

28:21.667 --> 28:25.100
Now this feels like we're--
We're stuck here.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.667
I never said you had to stay.

28:29.901 --> 28:31.133
Then I won't.

28:32.133 --> 28:35.367
It's not-- Julia--

28:35.367 --> 28:37.767
I-I don't get it.

28:37.767 --> 28:39.767
I don't-- I don't get you.

28:39.767 --> 28:41.133
You're the one
that said that--

28:41.133 --> 28:43.701
That it's not enough
for me just to want you.

28:43.701 --> 28:47.767
Well, now, I want this.

28:54.567 --> 28:58.634
I don't know about you, but I am
gonna sleep like a baby.

29:09.501 --> 29:11.267
Grace.

29:11.267 --> 29:14.000
Yeah?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.868
Look,
I know this is, um--

29:17.868 --> 29:20.133
I wanna ask you
something.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.267
I think I should
probably ask you.

29:24.968 --> 29:28.000
Do you ever
see it happening with us?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.634
Kids, I mean.

29:29.634 --> 29:31.100
What?

29:31.100 --> 29:33.267
Oh, Charlie, God.

29:33.267 --> 29:36.100
I mean,

29:36.100 --> 29:38.467
I totally understand where
you're coming from.

29:38.467 --> 29:41.901
I was-- I was relieved too,
when you told me.

29:41.901 --> 29:44.934
But, I don't know,

29:44.934 --> 29:48.167
I wasn't nearly as relieved
as you were.

29:48.167 --> 29:52.133
Charlie, come on,
why are we talking about this?

29:52.133 --> 29:55.100
It's too soon to be
talking about this.

29:55.100 --> 29:58.000
Yeah. I know it is.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.868
It's not like I'm looking
to have kids right now.

30:00.868 --> 30:04.100
But, I don't know. This--

30:04.100 --> 30:07.334
This thing sort of came up
and-- And now I'm wondering.

30:07.334 --> 30:09.567
You seem so--

30:09.567 --> 30:13.067
Like your mind is made up
about it. Is that--?

30:13.067 --> 30:16.534
Is that a now thing, or is that
more like a forever thing?

30:18.100 --> 30:20.367
Charlie,

30:20.367 --> 30:23.767
I don't wanna have children.

30:23.767 --> 30:26.267
That's just not part
of my game plan.

30:27.834 --> 30:31.801
Well, how do you know that?

30:31.801 --> 30:34.567
I mean, maybe you just haven't
met the right guy.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.801
I mean, until now.

30:39.167 --> 30:42.133
Look,

30:42.133 --> 30:46.300
when I was little
and I used to play with dolls,

30:46.300 --> 30:50.367
sometimes I'd be the teacher
and they'd be my students.

30:50.367 --> 30:53.901
And sometimes I'd be Diana Ross

30:53.901 --> 30:55.033
and they'd be my Supremes.

30:55.033 --> 30:59.100
But they were never my babies,
Charlie.

30:59.100 --> 31:02.601
I just didn't think
that way.

31:02.601 --> 31:06.200
Not then and not now.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.634
But maybe--

31:07.634 --> 31:10.767
Charlie, you asked
and I'm being honest with you.

31:10.767 --> 31:13.501
I'm--

31:13.501 --> 31:15.734
I don't wanna have children.

31:15.734 --> 31:18.334
And that's--

31:18.334 --> 31:21.601
That's just kind of who I am.

31:25.534 --> 31:27.501
[DINGS]

31:29.634 --> 31:33.300
Hey. I know you said
you didn't want me to be here,

31:33.300 --> 31:37.000
but, wow, Claud,
you were incredible.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.601
The couple next to me, they were
clapping so hard for you.

31:39.601 --> 31:40.767
If you didn't do an encore,

31:40.767 --> 31:44.334
I think they would have ended up
in the hospital.

31:44.334 --> 31:45.634
So you wanna
do something?

31:45.634 --> 31:47.467
You wanna get some dessert
and celebrate?

31:47.467 --> 31:50.133
Or we can check out Melrose?
Just-- Just cut it out. Okay?

31:50.133 --> 31:51.734
Cut what out?

31:51.734 --> 31:54.968
Being all nice and concerned
and "what do you want, Claud?"

31:54.968 --> 31:56.934
You're only doing it
'cause you screwed up.

31:56.934 --> 31:58.467
Claudia.

31:58.467 --> 32:00.734
Look, Claudia,
what do you want me to say?

32:00.734 --> 32:02.968
I'm sorry.
You're always sorry,

32:02.968 --> 32:05.300
and I'm just getting sick
of of it. Okay?

32:05.300 --> 32:06.801
Well--
'Cause all I do

32:06.801 --> 32:08.400
is worry about you,
Bailey, and--

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
What--? What happened to you
worrying about me?

32:10.400 --> 32:12.801
Of course I worry about you,
Claud.

32:12.801 --> 32:16.234
Do you? Do you know
what a big deal tonight was?

32:16.234 --> 32:19.000
Do you really know
how scary it is to stand

32:19.000 --> 32:20.501
in front
of a thousand people

32:20.501 --> 32:22.834
who have heard the Bartók
a zillion times, only--

32:22.834 --> 32:25.701
Only played by Itzhak Perlman
or-- Or Isaac Stern?

32:26.901 --> 32:29.434
It's-- It's hard to breathe,
and--

32:29.434 --> 32:33.467
And your fingers, they--
They feel all thick and you--

32:33.467 --> 32:37.367
Y-you feel-- You feel--

32:37.367 --> 32:38.434
What?

32:38.434 --> 32:40.667
Alone.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.100
I felt alone.

32:43.100 --> 32:46.200
I can't count on you anymore,
Bailey.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.501
And I can't go to you to make me
feel better because you're--

32:50.767 --> 32:52.801
All of a sudden
I'm the one taking care of you,

32:52.801 --> 32:54.701
cleaning up after you,
watching out for you,

32:54.701 --> 32:56.000
and it's not fair.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.901
Why not?
Why isn't that fair?

32:58.901 --> 33:00.167
Because I'm older
than you?

33:00.167 --> 33:02.367
Because you need
taking care of and I don't?

33:02.367 --> 33:04.200
Will you stop?

33:04.200 --> 33:07.734
Listen, Claudia,
I wish more than anything

33:07.734 --> 33:10.267
that you didn't have to watch me
fight this the way I am.

33:10.267 --> 33:11.734
But you do.

33:11.734 --> 33:14.501
Now, I am sorry,
but that is just the way it is.

33:14.501 --> 33:16.167
Great.

33:16.167 --> 33:18.000
Hey, you know what?

33:18.000 --> 33:20.601
You know what?
You're not a baby anymore.

33:20.601 --> 33:22.968
And you're not gonna be a kid
for that much longer either.

33:22.968 --> 33:26.534
So maybe--

33:26.534 --> 33:29.767
Maybe you could
come through for me.

33:41.334 --> 33:43.467
Hey.
Hey.

33:43.467 --> 33:45.434
I thought you guys were
heading out of town?

33:45.434 --> 33:48.334
Yeah,
I thought so too.

33:48.334 --> 33:49.734
Is something going on?

33:49.734 --> 33:51.434
Hm?

33:51.434 --> 33:56.200
Oh, no. I was just
in the mood for an early lunch.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.701
Yeah? It's 9:30.

33:58.701 --> 34:00.934
Charlie,

34:00.934 --> 34:03.100
do you think I'm selfish?

34:03.100 --> 34:05.000
Incredibly. Why?

34:06.267 --> 34:09.000
No, I-- I mean it.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.766
Okay. Selfish in what way?

34:11.766 --> 34:16.033
Well, Griffin is buying
a motorcycle shop

34:16.033 --> 34:19.833
with the money he got,
and it's, like,

34:19.833 --> 34:23.300
this really great opportunity
for him. You know?

34:23.300 --> 34:24.967
And that's bad because?

34:24.967 --> 34:26.534
No. No.

34:26.534 --> 34:28.934
It's good.
Good for Griffin.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.868
But not for you?

34:30.868 --> 34:33.634
Well,

34:33.634 --> 34:35.667
yeah.

34:35.667 --> 34:38.400
Yeah. 'Cause now we can't do
any of the stuff

34:38.400 --> 34:41.167
I thought we were
gonna do together, and...

34:42.734 --> 34:45.601
I don't know.

34:45.601 --> 34:49.234
It's just everything
is going great.

34:49.234 --> 34:52.033
And I-- I thought we wanted
the same things.

34:52.033 --> 34:55.601
And now all of a sudden, he
wants something that is, like,

34:55.601 --> 34:57.801
totally different.

34:57.801 --> 35:00.133
And I just--

35:00.133 --> 35:02.834
I don't know
where to put that.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.467
You know what I mean?

35:05.467 --> 35:08.367
Yeah. I sort of do.

35:09.834 --> 35:13.167
I guess the question
you gotta ask yourself is

35:13.167 --> 35:14.968
which is more important?

35:14.968 --> 35:18.567
Griffin or all that stuff
you want.

 <i>Problem solved.</i>

35:41.667 --> 35:44.033
So where'd you guys
disappear to this morning?

35:44.033 --> 35:47.133
Claudia took me backstage
at the Music Center,

35:47.133 --> 35:50.767
and we watched this incredible
string quartet rehearse,

35:50.767 --> 35:53.267
and, um-- And we talked.

35:58.167 --> 36:00.634
I told him about Walter Alcott

36:00.634 --> 36:02.567
and all that stuff.

36:02.567 --> 36:05.133
Oh, yeah?

36:05.133 --> 36:08.367
It just goes from bad to worse,
huh?

36:08.367 --> 36:10.133
Things can turn around.
You never know.

36:10.133 --> 36:11.400
Yeah.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.534
Hey, I'm talking
from experience here.

36:14.534 --> 36:16.868
I mean, you're looking at a guy
whose doctor said to him,

36:16.868 --> 36:19.634
"If you keep doing the one thing
that you really love to do,

36:19.634 --> 36:21.300
"if you keep working
your restaurant,

36:21.300 --> 36:23.033
you're gonna kill yourself."

36:23.033 --> 36:26.634
I was 50 years old.
I had no job, no family.

36:26.634 --> 36:29.601
Do you think I went wandering
around the world for fun?

36:29.601 --> 36:31.234
I was lost.

36:32.367 --> 36:34.334
I was lost.

36:34.334 --> 36:36.400
And then I met this woman.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.868
Yeah, well, that's great.

36:39.868 --> 36:41.434
You're a lucky guy.

36:41.434 --> 36:43.200
It's not luck.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.667
It's not luck.

36:44.667 --> 36:48.033
I don't know. Maybe it's because
I'm getting older,

36:48.033 --> 36:50.968
and I need to start
making sense of this world,

36:50.968 --> 36:55.934
but I kind of like to think that
it was God looking out for me.

36:55.934 --> 36:59.200
It was God saying,
"I'm not gonna let you go."

36:59.200 --> 37:00.567
Okay.

37:00.567 --> 37:02.634
I know what this is about.

37:02.634 --> 37:06.434
This is about me and God and not
wanting to go to AA, right?

37:06.434 --> 37:09.033
Everybody needs something
to believe in, Bailey,

37:09.033 --> 37:10.601
besides themselves.

37:10.601 --> 37:12.234
Not me.

37:12.234 --> 37:14.167
I don't.

37:16.334 --> 37:17.601
I hate to break it to you,
Joe,

37:17.601 --> 37:21.501
but we're all pretty much
on our own here.

37:21.501 --> 37:23.868
And there's nobody
looking out for any of us.

37:23.868 --> 37:25.534
Just cut it out, Bailey.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.501
Don't say stuff like that.

37:27.501 --> 37:29.667
JOE:
Somebody was looking out
for me.

37:29.667 --> 37:31.467
Somebody was looking out
for your father

37:31.467 --> 37:32.634
when he stopped drinking.

37:32.634 --> 37:35.234
Yeah, well, it wasn't God. Okay?

37:38.033 --> 37:41.801
Look, you believe whatever
you want to believe in, Joe.

37:41.801 --> 37:45.133
If you're afraid of dying,
and you need to believe in God,

37:45.133 --> 37:46.567
then that's your business.

37:46.567 --> 37:49.567
I'm just saying
that I don't see him in my life.

37:49.567 --> 37:52.834
How about in the fact that your
father's inside of you?

37:52.834 --> 37:55.934
Come on.
I'm serious.

37:55.934 --> 37:57.701
Your father is in you,

37:57.701 --> 38:00.868
and this is the proof,
and it means nothing to you.

38:00.868 --> 38:03.000
Really?

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
The fact that I got
this disease from him?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.234
It means plenty to me, Joe.

38:07.234 --> 38:10.100
Why do you insist on always
looking at the bad stuff,

38:10.100 --> 38:11.234
Bailey?

38:14.033 --> 38:15.834
You really think
I showed up at your house,

38:15.834 --> 38:17.501
and told you about
your dad's drinking

38:17.501 --> 38:20.534
because I wanted to make things
worse for you?

38:20.534 --> 38:22.267
I told you
because I thought it would

38:22.267 --> 38:23.868
give you a little hope.

38:23.868 --> 38:27.601
Yeah. You got what made
your father start drinking.

38:27.601 --> 38:31.334
But if you just look for it,
you got what made him stop too.

38:31.334 --> 38:33.334
You know what--
CLAUDIA: Why not?

38:33.334 --> 38:35.567
Why isn't it possible?

38:37.234 --> 38:40.200
Maybe you got all the stuff
that made us love him

38:40.200 --> 38:43.968
and made Mom love him.

38:43.968 --> 38:45.901
Maybe you got all of him.

38:45.901 --> 38:48.300
No, I don't.

38:50.501 --> 38:52.767
What does this have to do
with God anyway?

38:52.767 --> 38:55.501
Are you kidding me?

38:55.501 --> 38:57.267
Are you kidding me?

38:58.934 --> 39:03.000
Your father didn't disappear.
He's inside of you.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.067
And that doesn't
just happen.

39:05.067 --> 39:07.901
If the world were random
and mean,

39:07.901 --> 39:11.267
the way you think it is...

39:11.267 --> 39:14.434
I think that it's proof
that there's someone

39:14.434 --> 39:17.567
or something
looking out for us.

39:23.234 --> 39:25.501
I don't know.
It's not a curse, Bailey.

39:25.501 --> 39:27.400
It's a gift.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.234
You just gotta
look at it that way.

39:32.367 --> 39:34.601
Every time you fight
the urge to drink,

39:34.601 --> 39:38.067
every time you beat
the urge to drink,

39:38.067 --> 39:39.667
you feel him.

39:41.834 --> 39:45.734
And you know he didn't really
leave you when he died.

39:45.734 --> 39:48.601
He's still here.
