00:20.833 --> 00:22.916
The Chickering residence.

00:23.625 --> 00:25.166
He's asleep.

00:27.583 --> 00:29.833
Do you realize
the hour, sir?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.500
Hold the wire.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.458
Bertram.

00:38.458 --> 00:39.833
( pounds on door )

00:39.833 --> 00:41.916
Bertram?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.875
- ( pounds )
- Bertie: Yes, what is it?

00:43.875 --> 00:46.791
- Telephone.
- What?

00:50.000 --> 00:54.291
This is Bertie.
Um, Bertram.

00:54.291 --> 00:56.708
Yes.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.916
Yes, Dr. Thackery.

00:57.916 --> 01:01.333
I'll be right there.

01:01.333 --> 01:04.083
And what did your esteemed
chief want so urgently?

01:04.083 --> 01:06.041
- He needs me
at the hospital.
- Now?

01:06.041 --> 01:08.166
It had best
be an emergency.

01:08.166 --> 01:10.583
It's just some
experiments.

01:10.583 --> 01:13.166
What kind of experiment
can't wait until
the sun comes up?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:39.000 --> 01:41.333
- Dr. Thackery.
- Ah, Bertie. Good.

01:41.333 --> 01:43.083
You're finally here.
Scrub in.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.875
We got a lot
of work to do.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.250
Introductions...
this is Lin-Lin

01:48.250 --> 01:52.833
and this wonderful
creature is Delores.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.541
There's no chance
in hell that's her real name,
but it seems to suit her.

01:54.541 --> 01:57.250
Now, I once met a Thai girl
in the profession,

01:57.250 --> 02:00.416
swore her name
was Colette Bonaparte.

02:00.416 --> 02:03.208
I suppose it's all
part of the transaction,
you know?

02:03.208 --> 02:04.916
She pretends,
we pretend.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.375
A good time
is had by all.

02:12.458 --> 02:15.625
How long have you
been working in here?

02:15.625 --> 02:16.791
What day is it?

02:16.791 --> 02:18.958
Strictly speaking,
it's Monday morning.

02:18.958 --> 02:21.291
Two days.

02:21.291 --> 02:23.833
All weekend
without a break?

02:23.833 --> 02:25.333
We took a few
small breaks.

02:30.250 --> 02:34.791
Doctor, I think
you need some sleep.

02:34.791 --> 02:36.875
Nonsense.
If you please.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.208
These ladies work
by the hour

02:38.208 --> 02:39.916
and their rate
is on the high side

02:39.916 --> 02:41.458
due to their cleanliness
and good humor.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.208
So scrub in,
Bertie the Wise,

02:43.208 --> 02:45.166
for I have many new secrets
to reveal to you.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.916
Believe then,
if you please,

02:48.916 --> 02:51.541
that I can do
strange things.

02:51.541 --> 02:54.000
( theme music playing )

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Thackery:
So what did Christiansen
do wrong?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.083
Besides blow
his brains out.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.541
I'm not sure
what you mean.

03:01.541 --> 03:02.791
All of those
placenta previa cases

03:02.791 --> 03:04.916
and the babies that
he endeavored to save.

03:04.916 --> 03:06.375
I pored over those papers

03:06.375 --> 03:09.000
and there was nothing
that he did wrong surgically.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.583
His problem
was conceptual.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.000
He believed
that the one variable
he needed to change

03:12.000 --> 03:13.750
was him getting faster,

03:13.750 --> 03:18.250
but there was a second
variable he never even
considered.

03:18.250 --> 03:20.416
Come on, Bertie,
you've got to think bigger.

03:20.416 --> 03:21.875
You know, widen
your mental scope.

03:21.875 --> 03:24.625
Are you tired?
'Cause I can give
you something for it.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.791
What else could have
changed about the surgery?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.583
The patient dying slower.

03:31.583 --> 03:35.083
Precisely!
Bertie the Wise indeed.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.375
You know,
it is such a shame

03:37.375 --> 03:39.500
that your father
doesn't share your
sort of curiosity.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.083
That man seems to practice
medicine in 1885.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.416
But how could that
be accomplished,

03:44.416 --> 03:46.083
the patient dying
more slowly?

03:46.083 --> 03:47.708
Pressure on the tear
in the womb.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.333
To slow the bleeding.
We tried that.

03:49.333 --> 03:50.833
A wrap around
the woman's abdomen.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.291
Pressing down
on specific sites.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.791
We even tried tight
bandages around the womb.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.791
All attempted from
outside of the organ.

03:55.791 --> 03:59.583
I intend to put pressure
directly on the bleed
in the womb

03:59.583 --> 04:01.166
from the inside.

04:01.166 --> 04:06.166
( Bertie laughs )
Right, but, okay,

04:06.166 --> 04:08.875
short of crawling up
in there, I'm not sure
that could be done.

04:08.875 --> 04:12.250
Lord knows we've
all wanted to try that
at one time or another.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.958
But in this case,
we're just gonna
have to rely

04:14.958 --> 04:16.625
on pneumatics
to do the job for us.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.000
- You know what this is?
- A Champetier de Ribes
balloon.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.500
Correct.
Used in the vaginal canal
to speed dilation.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.416
- But I don't like it.
- Why not?

04:24.416 --> 04:27.750
Because it's French
and I didn't invent it.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.291
And it's also the wrong
shape for our purposes.

04:31.958 --> 04:34.041
Good old American
basketball.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.916
Much more
preferable.

04:38.041 --> 04:39.625
What is that?

04:39.625 --> 04:41.958
This is something that
I invented yesterday...

04:41.958 --> 04:43.333
or the day before.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.708
It's a sheath that
allows the bladder

04:45.708 --> 04:48.000
to keep its correct shape
for insertion.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.125
You know, if a penis
can make the trip one way

04:50.125 --> 04:52.333
and a baby the other...

04:52.333 --> 04:56.125
Look, this is what we do.
We insert the basketball
bladder bullet,

04:56.125 --> 04:59.083
the BBB, up into the vagina,
up into the uterus,

04:59.083 --> 05:01.791
and then we leave
the air tube trailing
and remaining outside.

05:01.791 --> 05:04.166
We then remove the sheath
so that the bladder can open.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.208
We then attach a pump
to the air tube

05:06.208 --> 05:09.041
and we pump up the bladder
inside the woman

05:09.041 --> 05:12.625
so that it expands
and hardens against
the bleed.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.875
We then add a weight
to the tube

05:14.875 --> 05:16.625
so that it puts pressure
on the wound,

05:16.625 --> 05:21.208
slowing the bleeding,
giving ourselves
more time.

05:21.208 --> 05:23.541
( chuckles )

05:23.541 --> 05:25.958
Brilliant.
Does it work?

05:25.958 --> 05:29.291
Well, I've been trying it
on the girls and we need
more study.

05:29.291 --> 05:31.833
That's why we're
gonna spend the rest
of the night in here

05:31.833 --> 05:33.791
inserting these
into our lady friends

05:33.791 --> 05:35.166
and testing
all variables.

05:38.916 --> 05:40.166
Um, right.

05:40.166 --> 05:43.166
Well, they're
not pregnant.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.916
So there's gonna
be a problem

05:45.916 --> 05:48.333
with the difference
of the size of the uterus

05:48.333 --> 05:50.416
- as well as
the lack of di...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:50.416 --> 05:53.125
-... dilation of the cervix.
- That's all true.

05:53.125 --> 05:56.625
But, you know,
our budget won't allow
for pregnant prostitutes.

05:56.625 --> 05:59.208
So we're just gonna
have to make do with
what we see here.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.458
Okay.
( laughs )

06:09.458 --> 06:11.500
( water running )

06:35.750 --> 06:38.125
( crying )

06:39.458 --> 06:43.166
She looks better
this morning,
more robust.

06:43.166 --> 06:46.416
Look at her cheeks.
They're pink.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.916
That's a healthy pink.

06:48.916 --> 06:50.708
Sister Harriet:
Mrs. Gallinger,

06:50.708 --> 06:53.125
I feel it's important
to be candid with you.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.000
Lillian's fever
has gone up.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.916
That's the pink you see.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.791
She's not responding
to light or sound.

06:59.791 --> 07:02.250
Her fontanel's
protruding further,

07:02.250 --> 07:05.583
telling us she's got
enormous brain swelling,
and it's increasing.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.041
She's going
to get better.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.666
Sister Harriet:
We've all been praying
for that

07:08.666 --> 07:11.708
and you can't give up hope
your little girl will recover,

07:11.708 --> 07:14.083
but you also need to know
there's a chance

07:14.083 --> 07:15.916
that the Lord will be
calling Lillian home.

07:15.916 --> 07:18.416
No. No.
Everett will think
of something.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.583
There's really
almost nothing...

07:21.583 --> 07:24.041
You brought this
into our house.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.958
You admitted so
yourself.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.333
You have to fix this.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.416
Do something for her,
Everett.

07:32.416 --> 07:34.500
Our daughter is dying.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.583
Eleanor, please.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.333
You said there was
almost nothing.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.958
That must mean
there's something.

07:44.958 --> 07:46.625
What is it, Everett?

07:47.833 --> 07:50.958
Venesection.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.083
What is that?

07:54.083 --> 07:55.416
Bleeding.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.875
Sister Harriet:
It has very little chance.

07:56.875 --> 07:59.041
I'll take any chance.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.625
( crying )

08:21.625 --> 08:23.500
Chinatown.
Mott Street.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.000
So long.

08:30.291 --> 08:31.208
Thank you, ladies.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.207
You've been
such a great help.

08:35.207 --> 08:38.625
- See you tonight, Johnny?
- Possibly.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.541
Could you tell Wu
that I'll settle my tab
for your services then?

08:41.541 --> 08:43.250
Mm-hmm.

08:51.958 --> 08:53.833
Bertie!

08:57.416 --> 09:01.416
You know, I think
I need to make a few small
modifications to the sheath.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.583
It might be a tad snug.
Did you sense that?

09:03.583 --> 09:05.958
I had to use a little more
force than I expected.

09:05.958 --> 09:07.583
And those ladies
aren't drums.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.708
But the pressure
on those last few
attempts felt correct.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.041
I agree, but it's all
just conjecture until we get
an actual previa patient.

09:12.041 --> 09:15.041
I'm gonna have
Sister Harriet

09:15.041 --> 09:17.083
put out requests
at the other hospitals.

09:17.083 --> 09:20.083
Any chance we can
give them is better than
what they're facing now.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.458
You know,
you might consider

09:22.458 --> 09:25.083
using water instead
of air for the bladders.

09:25.083 --> 09:28.541
It'll add more weight
and might conform better
to the patient's anatomy.

09:30.708 --> 09:33.708
Brilliant.

09:33.708 --> 09:37.125
Bertie,
fine work today.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.416
You're making
great progress.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.958
Speight: Near as we can tell,
the typhoid started at
Elihu Brown's house

09:49.958 --> 09:53.958
eight months ago
and moved to the Cooke
house on 5th a month later.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.833
Next came the nine guests
at the Bedford Hotel.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.458
Then it started taking it
back to your circle again

09:58.458 --> 10:00.750
at the home of Roger
Conaughton's widow.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.250
Two of her grandchildren
went down with it

10:02.250 --> 10:04.750
as well as a garden man
and scullery maid,

10:04.750 --> 10:06.750
who may or may not
have been cavorting.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.708
You saw the look
on her face, Jacob.

10:08.708 --> 10:11.083
Cavorting was the least
those two were doing.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.041
From the Conaughtons'
to the Abbott country home
in Oyster Bay,

10:14.041 --> 10:16.041
getting the young one
and the father.

10:16.041 --> 10:18.541
Next came Cora
and Daniel Hemming.

10:18.541 --> 10:20.000
How's the young
girl doing?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.083
There have
been complications
and another surgery,

10:23.083 --> 10:25.083
but the disease seems
to have run its course.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.625
After the Hemmings?

10:26.625 --> 10:28.500
The Vanderwerfs
up in Riverdale got it.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.625
And now the Selwyn Arms
Restaurant.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.958
That's at least
11 more right there.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.375
So what's the link?

10:33.375 --> 10:34.958
They got only
one thing in common.

10:34.958 --> 10:37.750
Something they all
seem to be enjoying
these warm days.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.833
- The ice cream?
- More like what's
in the ice cream.

10:40.833 --> 10:44.375
A peach.
Or, specifically,
peach melba.

10:44.375 --> 10:45.958
And the woman
who prepared it

10:45.958 --> 10:47.708
for every one
of those people
who got sick...

10:47.708 --> 10:49.375
Cornelia:
Mary Mallon.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.000
A lot of places to work
in such a short time.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.083
Well, families often hire
part-time cooks for a week
here or there

10:56.083 --> 10:58.625
and then on to
the employ of some
other home or restaurant.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.875
In this case,
to infect more people.

11:00.875 --> 11:04.208
She must be a filthy thing
and sick as a cod
in a cesspool.

11:04.208 --> 11:07.125
Believe me, no mistress
would hire her if she looked
the least bit ill.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.958
Well, that's a conundrum
we can solve when we get
our hands on the cow.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.916
We got to find her first.

11:10.916 --> 11:15.625
Families like these
use only two agencies
to find their help.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.125
Mrs. Grover's
for the new money

11:17.125 --> 11:18.791
and Bigsby's
for the old.

11:18.791 --> 11:20.583
If she's working
for the wealthy
in New York City,

11:20.583 --> 11:24.125
she's been through
at least one of those doors.

11:24.125 --> 11:26.958
Then we're gonna have
to go through them, too.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.166
Where are you,
Typhoid Mary?

11:32.625 --> 11:35.833
Barrow:
Where did you say
this machine was originally?

11:35.833 --> 11:37.791
Luff:
The fellas at
Johns Hopkins had it.

11:37.791 --> 11:39.125
They've since found
a better model,

11:39.125 --> 11:40.791
so I took it off
their hands,

11:40.791 --> 11:42.000
which is fortunate
for you.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.041
- And it works fine?
- Like it was new.

11:45.041 --> 11:48.375
My children were taking
dozens of X-rays of themselves
on it the other day.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.041
Had the thing
running for hours.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.041
No trouble at all.

11:52.041 --> 11:54.708
Seem to be some nicks
and dents.

11:54.708 --> 11:57.208
Well, that's to be expected
from a secondhand piece.

11:57.208 --> 12:00.250
If you don't take
my word for it,

12:00.250 --> 12:01.291
try it out
for yourself.

12:05.541 --> 12:06.583
Never had an X-ray made.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.750
Well, what would
you like to see?

12:08.750 --> 12:11.458
Your hand?
Rib cage perhaps?

12:11.458 --> 12:13.583
My head.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.583
Why not?

12:15.583 --> 12:17.875
Step right over here.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.833
There you go.
Just right there.

12:19.833 --> 12:23.583
Now, if you would,
put that plate

12:23.583 --> 12:25.833
up to your face.

12:25.833 --> 12:26.916
Good.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.958
Now, the trick is

12:29.958 --> 12:32.916
to stay as still
as possible

12:32.916 --> 12:34.541
for the best results.

12:34.541 --> 12:37.208
( machine crackling )

12:37.708 --> 12:40.208
There.

12:40.208 --> 12:42.583
This should take
about an hour.

12:45.791 --> 12:48.291
( flash pops )

12:50.500 --> 12:52.250
Very well done.

12:52.250 --> 12:56.958
Now you'll always
have a photo

12:56.958 --> 12:58.958
to remember her by.

13:00.958 --> 13:04.708
My condolences,
ma'am, sir.

13:17.791 --> 13:20.500
( footsteps approaching )

13:20.500 --> 13:23.958
Cornelia: This looks
like a very solitary way
to spend your lunch.

13:23.958 --> 13:27.041
( sighs )
Are you coming
or going?

13:27.041 --> 13:29.333
Going. I'm meeting
Inspector Speight

13:29.333 --> 13:31.500
for some more interviews
about the typhoid cases.

13:31.500 --> 13:34.208
Oh. How's that going?

13:34.208 --> 13:36.875
We think we may have
found the source.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.416
We?

13:39.500 --> 13:40.208
Sounds intimate.

13:40.208 --> 13:42.750
( laughs )
Algie.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.708
I don't blame you.
He's ill-mannered,

13:44.708 --> 13:46.875
his clothes are stained,
and he always seems to have

13:46.875 --> 13:49.250
some food hanging
out of his mouth.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.166
Every woman's dream.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.750
You think Phillip
will understand?

13:53.750 --> 13:56.500
A gentleman knows
when he's been bested
and must step aside.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.250
( laughs )

13:58.250 --> 14:00.041
How's my mother feeling?

14:00.041 --> 14:02.583
You wouldn't have to ask
if you came to the house
more often.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.208
I know. I know.
I've just been
so busy here.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.208
Well, she's fine.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.750
In fact, she looks
better than you.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.625
Are you sleeping at all?

14:11.625 --> 14:14.333
Not enough.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.875
Working at the Knick
all day and...

14:16.875 --> 14:19.250
researching at night.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.416
I don't know
how Thackery does it.

14:21.416 --> 14:24.000
Where does his endless
energy come from?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.541
You know
all about stamina.

14:25.541 --> 14:28.875
All those contests you,
Henry and I used to have.

14:28.875 --> 14:32.666
- ( chuckles )
- That time we tried
to stand on the roof

14:32.666 --> 14:35.666
on one foot the longest,
see who would win.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.958
Ah.
( laughs )

14:37.958 --> 14:39.875
I was out there
for only a minute

14:39.875 --> 14:42.750
before I felt the slightest
breeze and ran in.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.458
Henry quit
right after me,

14:44.458 --> 14:47.666
but you, you stayed
out there for hours.

14:47.666 --> 14:49.791
Mostly in the rain.

14:49.791 --> 14:51.250
The contest was over,
but you wouldn't budge.

14:53.916 --> 14:57.250
I think you're tougher
than you think you are.

14:57.250 --> 15:01.250
Dedicating yourself
to the Knick is no
ladies' tea party.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.083
Perhaps.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.458
I should be going.

15:09.583 --> 15:12.208
It was good talking
with you, Algie.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.500
Anytime.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.208
And say hello
to your secret love.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.583
I feel like I'm looking
into my soul.

15:27.666 --> 15:30.250
Let's talk about
your price.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.458
Well, new, a machine
like this could cost
as much as...

15:33.458 --> 15:35.458
3,000.
I am aware.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.125
But it is not new,

15:37.125 --> 15:39.208
which is precisely
why I called on you.

15:39.208 --> 15:42.958
The hospital
has limited funds.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.416
Well, I could give it
to you for 2,500.

15:45.416 --> 15:48.458
I was thinking more
in the range of 1,500.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.541
It's not just the machine.

15:50.541 --> 15:52.333
It's the upkeep,

15:52.333 --> 15:53.708
it's ordering
the photographic plates.

15:53.708 --> 15:57.708
And who knows how long
the uranium inside
will last.

15:59.666 --> 16:01.416
I'll meet you halfway.

16:01.416 --> 16:03.000
2,000.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.791
Well...

16:09.791 --> 16:12.666
it is still more
than I had hoped.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.041
But we've gone
long enough

16:17.041 --> 16:19.833
without one.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.708
So...

16:21.708 --> 16:24.333
2,000 it is, Mr. Luff.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.583
Wonderful.

16:25.583 --> 16:28.833
- Is this the new machine?
- It is indeed.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.625
Can we have
a turn on it?

16:30.625 --> 16:32.875
Be my guests, ladies.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.541
- How does it work?
- Allow me.

16:34.541 --> 16:37.500
All right, closer.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.875
Closer.
Closer.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.666
- ( giggles )
- Not that close!

16:41.666 --> 16:44.333
- ( laughs )
- All right, here we go.

16:47.666 --> 16:49.291
So it's rest and healing
for several weeks

16:49.291 --> 16:52.000
until the flap
fully attaches.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.708
And no vigorous movement.

16:55.708 --> 16:58.416
Sadly, I haven't
had occasion

16:58.416 --> 17:00.958
for vigorous movement
in quite some time.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.666
Oh, come now, John.

17:03.666 --> 17:07.958
I won't pretend that this
isn't absolutely ridiculous.

17:11.540 --> 17:15.165
So, I'll see you
back here soon

17:15.165 --> 17:16.833
and we'll finish the job.

17:16.833 --> 17:19.250
Let's get you a cab.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.083
I prefer to walk.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.290
- Really?
- Of course.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.458
It's a lovely day.

17:26.458 --> 17:29.166
Well, it was
looking like rain.

17:30.125 --> 17:33.166
It always looks
like rain

17:33.166 --> 17:36.208
if you only look
at the clouds.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.125
Don't look at the clouds
so much, John.

17:54.208 --> 17:56.916
So you will let me
know if you receive
a previa case?

17:56.916 --> 17:59.750
Thank you, Dr. Rasmussen.

17:59.750 --> 18:02.041
That is appreciated.
Good day.

18:02.041 --> 18:06.041
- Dr. Thackery.
- Mr. Luff.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.250
So what will
you be attempting
to sell me today?

18:08.250 --> 18:12.000
I have all the surgical
supplies I need.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.333
( chuckles )
I was actually hoping
to interest you

18:14.333 --> 18:18.333
in doing a little
selling of your own.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.041
Who are the new
heroes in America?
Sousa and Joplin?

18:21.041 --> 18:22.000
President McKinley?
Cap Anson?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
( laughs )
No longer.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.291
People now believe
passionately in the men
who will bring them miracles...

18:27.291 --> 18:30.916
doctors, inventors,
architects.

18:30.916 --> 18:32.958
These are the new
American gods.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.208
Edison, Halsted,
and Roebling.

18:35.208 --> 18:38.541
Technology and innovation
will be the world's salvation

18:38.541 --> 18:39.541
and the people know it.

18:39.541 --> 18:41.000
They crave
what's coming next.

18:41.000 --> 18:44.750
And their faith...
ah, their faith
is bottomless.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.958
And you mean
to exploit that faith.

18:46.958 --> 18:50.166
No, I mean to give
them the solutions
that they're looking for.

18:50.166 --> 18:53.791
We are the supplier
of the finest medical
products in the world.

18:53.791 --> 18:57.541
We want to be the maker
of the best medicines
and elixirs as well.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.833
And with your help,
we think we can be.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.375
You want me to invent
medicines for you?

19:02.375 --> 19:05.791
That's not my field
of expertise.

19:05.791 --> 19:08.208
No need.
The medicine's already
been crafted.

19:08.208 --> 19:11.083
Dr. Thackery's
Rejuvenation Liniment.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.083
Rub it on your trouble
spots thrice daily,

19:13.083 --> 19:14.291
your malady
will disappear.
( laughs )

19:14.291 --> 19:17.916
Look, that's your picture
right there.

19:17.916 --> 19:20.250
We're gonna run articles
and advertising

19:20.250 --> 19:22.291
in newspapers
around the country.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.708
Even send you to the Paris
Exposition this summer.

19:34.458 --> 19:37.375
Dr. Thackery's
Rejuvenation Liniment

19:37.375 --> 19:40.208
treats rheumatism,
neuralgia,

19:40.208 --> 19:42.708
sciatica,
crippled back, lumbago,

19:42.708 --> 19:44.166
contracted muscles,
toothaches, sprains,

19:44.166 --> 19:47.333
kidney pain,
liver troubles,

19:47.333 --> 19:50.958
heart lameness,
leg swellings,
and cataracts.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.000
Is that all?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.083
Those are
very real claims.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.750
Well, then perhaps
you won't mind telling me

19:56.750 --> 20:00.583
the ingredients that make up
this miracle potion.

20:00.583 --> 20:03.750
Let's not be coy
with each other, Doctor.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.666
This is a booming market.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.500
We want our share of it.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.708
Last year Dr. Ayers'
Pectoral Plaster,

20:11.708 --> 20:14.208
Brown's Bronchial Troches,
Dr. Corbett's Brain Food,

20:14.208 --> 20:16.916
and Dr. Wordsley's
Female Pills

20:16.916 --> 20:19.458
accounted for
$5 million in sales.

20:19.458 --> 20:22.750
Dr. Pepper's Brain Tonic
is doing so well,

20:22.750 --> 20:25.000
they're serving it
at fountains all around
the city.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.791
As much a beverage
as it is a remedy.

20:27.791 --> 20:31.500
You are one of the most
respected physicians
in the nation.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.666
And with our help,
we think we can make you
one of the richest as well.

20:36.791 --> 20:39.458
And all I have to do
is loan you my name?

20:39.458 --> 20:43.625
Precisely.
The money will roll in
by the shovelful.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.625
You'll be one of the most
famous men in America.

20:45.625 --> 20:49.875
Nothing, nothing will be
beyond your reach.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.250
Can you give me some time
to think about it?

20:55.250 --> 20:57.916
Absolutely.
How much time
do you need?

20:57.916 --> 21:00.750
Until hell freezes over.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.333
In the meantime,
would you be so kind

21:03.333 --> 21:07.000
as to stick your head
firmly up your ass?

21:07.958 --> 21:10.375
Away, you mouldy rogue.

21:10.375 --> 21:11.125
Away.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.291
( sighs )

21:22.541 --> 21:25.166
( laughs )

21:25.166 --> 21:26.458
- Thank you.
- Man: Thank you, sir.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.500
Thank you.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.875
If you'd like
five or six more,

21:29.875 --> 21:32.125
we can just keep making
circles of the park.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.791
( laughs )

21:33.791 --> 21:35.500
Making believe
we've never met
the vendor

21:35.500 --> 21:37.250
every time
we come 'round.

21:37.250 --> 21:39.166
How much are
your pretzels, sir?

21:39.166 --> 21:41.250
Really?
Well, then I'll try one.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.625
( chuckles )

21:45.250 --> 21:47.250
So, how are you enjoying
the hospital so far?

21:47.250 --> 21:48.875
It's been seven weeks.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.541
You've been counting?

21:51.541 --> 21:55.791
Well, the place
did get a bit rosier
when you arrived.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.208
Do you say that
to all the new nurses?

21:59.208 --> 22:00.916
No, of course not.

22:00.916 --> 22:03.125
I was only teasing.

22:03.125 --> 22:05.166
I know you
wouldn't do that.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.833
Because I wouldn't.

22:10.833 --> 22:14.041
My mother says the first
time you meet someone,

22:14.041 --> 22:15.291
in that moment,
you can know their soul.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.208
I wish I knew that
when we first met.

22:19.208 --> 22:21.375
( laughs )

22:21.375 --> 22:24.458
You were helping
an edema patient
into bed.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.166
Oh.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.208
So you remember
the first time
you saw me?

22:30.208 --> 22:32.625
Don't go getting
full of yourself.

22:32.625 --> 22:36.208
I also remember
the first time I saw
Mr. Pouncey

22:36.208 --> 22:38.000
and he was picking
at his ear with a twig.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.083
( laughs )

22:41.958 --> 22:44.583
I'm not sure it's true
you can know someone
from the first moment,

22:44.583 --> 22:48.416
but maybe you
can get to know them
from some other moment.

22:49.958 --> 22:52.375
Even the hardest people
can surprise you.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.583
That's where
Dr. Thackery lives.

22:58.583 --> 23:01.750
I know.

23:01.750 --> 23:05.166
It's nicer inside
than you might think.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.875
Have you been inside?

23:07.875 --> 23:10.458
When you had me fetch him
for the bowel repair.

23:10.458 --> 23:12.333
Right. Right.

23:12.333 --> 23:16.000
The evening
of Mr. Gentile's
miraculous nerve block.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.166
He had me inside
while he readied himself.

23:19.166 --> 23:21.458
That was quite a day.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.125
It certainly was.

23:26.250 --> 23:27.833
There's no one
like Thackery.

23:27.833 --> 23:31.291
No, there isn't.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.291
I tried to explain it
to my father

23:33.291 --> 23:35.625
and he just scoffs.

23:35.625 --> 23:38.250
He wants me to join
his practice at Columbia.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.541
But why would I do that

23:41.541 --> 23:44.750
when I could be watching
the man invent the future

23:44.750 --> 23:46.916
right in front of me?

23:46.916 --> 23:50.583
To work so closely with
a surgeon of his genius,

23:50.583 --> 23:53.000
- it's...
- Intoxicating?

23:54.708 --> 23:56.583
Yeah.

24:00.333 --> 24:03.000
It means a lot to me
that you understand.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.916
I do.

24:10.708 --> 24:11.583
I just realized
I don't even like pretzels.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.250
( laughs )

24:17.041 --> 24:18.791
I, uh...

24:22.166 --> 24:24.041
I don't know why
I bought that.

24:24.041 --> 24:26.458
( chatter )

24:39.875 --> 24:43.375
Best not fix
on going toe-to-toe
with the Big Nig.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.166
He ain't no free swinger

24:47.166 --> 24:50.166
a fella your size can get
inside and surprise.

24:50.166 --> 24:53.000
The man's trained.
Professional-like.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.500
Knocked out
Jake Kilrain in five.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.583
Floored Mexican
Pete Everett seven times
before they stopped it.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.833
And took Tom Sharkey
all the way

25:00.833 --> 25:02.750
to the bloodiest draw
I ever saw.

25:02.750 --> 25:06.083
The Big Nig will kill
a man like you
in that alley

25:06.083 --> 25:08.708
and never break a sweat.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.208
( coins clatter )

25:18.458 --> 25:21.083
Thursday,
then I might
be too late.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.750
You know?
Hey!

25:23.750 --> 25:25.875
What?

25:38.250 --> 25:40.375
( groans )

25:42.291 --> 25:44.666
( man shouting )

26:13.166 --> 26:16.291
My deepest sympathies
to you both.

26:16.291 --> 26:18.250
Thank you, Sister.

26:20.541 --> 26:24.416
I can only imagine
the tremendous pain
in your hearts right now.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.291
God knows your suffering.

26:27.291 --> 26:29.833
I hope you know
He's here with you.

26:29.833 --> 26:32.500
She's going
to get better.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.041
Who, dear?

26:34.041 --> 26:35.833
Lillian.

26:35.833 --> 26:38.000
God will bring her
back to us.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.958
Eleanor.

26:39.958 --> 26:42.666
You'll say
a prayer, Sister?

26:42.666 --> 26:45.250
A prayer for Lillian's
return to health?

26:45.250 --> 26:47.083
Of course.

26:49.708 --> 26:53.041
Dr. Gallinger,
may I have a word
with you for a moment?

26:53.041 --> 26:54.708
Of course.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.458
Gallinger:
She won't accept it.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.833
She even prepared breakfast
for Lillian this morning.

27:08.833 --> 27:10.833
It's not uncommon.

27:12.208 --> 27:14.500
Once you place Lillian
in the ground,

27:14.500 --> 27:17.291
I don't envy the powerful
wave of melancholia

27:17.291 --> 27:20.125
that will engulf
this house.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.875
Perhaps there might
be a solution

27:21.875 --> 27:23.750
to help ease your loss.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.625
What is it?

27:25.625 --> 27:29.333
Recently a very young
baby, a girl,

27:29.333 --> 27:31.416
was found on the doorstep
of the orphanage.

27:31.416 --> 27:33.875
I understand
my impertinence,

27:33.875 --> 27:37.083
but I've seen many
a grieving mother.

27:37.083 --> 27:40.541
Death takes not only
the soul of the child,

27:40.541 --> 27:44.333
but can destroy the souls
of those left behind.

27:44.333 --> 27:47.958
If Eleanor can hold
a baby, nurture it,

27:47.958 --> 27:50.833
you can begin to find
your way again to heal.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.416
All I ask is that
you consider it.

28:06.625 --> 28:08.708
What are you doing here?

28:08.708 --> 28:10.291
We have business
to tend to.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.083
- May I help you?
- Inspector Speight,
Department of Health.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.500
We were told by Grover's
Domestic Placement Agency

28:26.500 --> 28:28.083
that a cook named Mary Mallon
is currently in your employ.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.750
- That true?
- Oh, I don't know any
of the help by name.

28:31.750 --> 28:35.458
Of course not, but we'd
like to come in ourselves
and meet your staff.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.708
Of course.
The cook is right inside.

28:37.708 --> 28:38.750
We're just sitting down
for lunch.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.500
You're more than welcome
to join us.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.916
I'd feel safer biting
into a bag of horse shit

28:42.916 --> 28:45.125
than eating anything
that twat made.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.875
( chatting, laughing )

28:55.041 --> 28:57.791
Looks like we found her.
Mary Mallon?

28:57.791 --> 29:00.708
- Who's asking?
- Inspector Speight
of the Health Department.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.875
This is Miss Robertson
of the Knickerbocker.

29:02.875 --> 29:05.083
- Officer Phineas Sears.
- Well, this ain't me kitchen.

29:05.083 --> 29:06.458
I was just hired on
in the last days.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.833
You need to speak
with Miss Nisbet.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.125
Actually, we need to speak
with you, Miss Mallon.

29:10.125 --> 29:11.875
Mary:
What's your business?

29:11.875 --> 29:14.375
Are you the Mary Mallon
who was employed at
the Hemming residence?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.083
- Yeah.
- And prior to that,

29:16.083 --> 29:18.458
did you work at
the Abbotts' country
home in Oyster Bay,

29:18.458 --> 29:19.625
Elihu Brown's,
the Haldemans',

29:19.625 --> 29:22.333
the Bedford Hotel,
and the Selwyn Arms?

29:22.333 --> 29:23.833
What of it?

29:23.833 --> 29:26.750
We believe, Miss Mallon,
that you may have infected

29:26.750 --> 29:29.208
those families and others
with typhoid fever.

29:29.208 --> 29:31.916
Typhoid?
( laughs )

29:31.916 --> 29:33.916
Well, you're loony.
Do I look sick to you?

29:33.916 --> 29:36.541
- Cornelia: No, however...
- However we've got at least
a dozen infected,

29:36.541 --> 29:39.791
many of them have already
gone to Abraham's bosom.

29:39.791 --> 29:42.416
The one thing
they got in common:
Your filthy mitts.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.708
Now, we need you to come
with us to the Knick

29:44.708 --> 29:47.250
and give us
your urine, saliva,
and feces for testing.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.208
I ain't going anywhere
with you people.

29:50.208 --> 29:52.416
I'm working
and these boys
need to eat.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.875
Not what you're cooking.
This ain't an invitation.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.791
You don't want to come,
Officer Sears and me

29:56.791 --> 29:58.250
can force you to comply.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.625
Come now, lady.

29:59.625 --> 30:01.375
Let's make this easy
for all of us.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.833
You want me saliva?
( spits )

30:03.833 --> 30:06.000
There!
Now the other two
ain't gonna come so easy.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.625
Speight:
Grab the bitch!

30:08.625 --> 30:11.333
- Get off of me!
Get off of me!
- Speight: Stop her!

30:11.333 --> 30:14.041
- Can't you see I'm not sick,
you stupid woman?
- Shut up!

30:14.041 --> 30:15.333
Get the fuck off of me
for fuck's sake!

30:15.333 --> 30:18.666
- Shut your filthy mouth.
- Get off of me!

30:18.666 --> 30:21.833
- Jesus Christ!
- ( Speight laughs )

30:21.833 --> 30:24.208
I never seen
a society girl join
the fracas that quick.

30:24.208 --> 30:27.500
( laughs )
Definitely a new century.

30:27.500 --> 30:30.416
Huh.

30:56.833 --> 30:58.583
This is quinine.

30:58.583 --> 31:01.208
A teaspoon
every four hours.

31:01.208 --> 31:03.916
If she develops any pain
in her lower region,

31:03.916 --> 31:07.583
have her douche
with creolin solution.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.041
I'll make sure
and check on her
in the next few days.

31:10.625 --> 31:13.583
Bless you.

31:14.583 --> 31:17.208
I don't know
what we would do.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.625
That'll be $8
for today, ma'am.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.291
I can look forward
to a poor night
of rest again.

31:28.291 --> 31:31.625
Perhaps you need
a fella by your side.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.000
Stay out of that habit
for an hour or two longer,

31:34.000 --> 31:34.708
you shall have no delay
in finding him.

31:34.708 --> 31:36.666
( chuckles )

31:36.666 --> 31:40.291
All right, Harry, what's
behind the sleeping trouble?

31:40.291 --> 31:42.583
Half of the time
I lay in bed

31:42.583 --> 31:45.791
convincing myself
that what I'm doing
is right by everyone.

31:45.791 --> 31:48.083
Like that girl
up there just now,

31:48.083 --> 31:52.000
her floor boss
forcing himself on her.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.708
I'm guessing it's
the other half of the time
that's the trouble.

31:54.708 --> 31:57.875
That's when
I lay there wondering
if I'm already dead.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.958
Fate sealed.

31:59.958 --> 32:02.541
And whatever good
I think I might do
won't save me.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.125
See? That.

32:04.125 --> 32:05.458
That's the part that
helps me sleep the best.

32:05.458 --> 32:09.333
If I'm going
to the furnace,
I'm going.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.375
Besides,
can't be worse

32:12.375 --> 32:13.833
than the place
I come from.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.250
Where was that?

32:15.250 --> 32:18.291
St. Joseph's Orphan Home
in Enniskean.

32:18.291 --> 32:22.291
The nuns were
wicked cuntiballs.

32:22.291 --> 32:24.083
Nothing like the house
you run at the Knick.

32:24.083 --> 32:28.250
These sisters,
they were happy to whale
on you all the day long.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.833
What's that say?

32:37.250 --> 32:39.375
It's chicken scratch.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.208
Compliments
of Sister Clarice.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.583
She'd whale
on my left hand

32:43.583 --> 32:45.458
with a three-foot dowel
every time I tried to use it.

32:45.458 --> 32:47.250
Forced me
to use my right.

32:47.250 --> 32:50.416
Taught me left-handed
were wicked, sinister-like.

32:50.416 --> 32:55.291
She'd whack me,
giving it out till
I puked myself.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.750
A couple of years of that
will turn you against

32:57.750 --> 32:59.083
them evil goats, God,
the whole thing.

32:59.083 --> 33:00.875
You can't paint us all
with that brush, Cleary.

33:00.875 --> 33:02.625
I serve God my way.

33:02.625 --> 33:05.916
I do His work
and remain true
to His cause.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.375
Except for
the abortions and all.

33:09.375 --> 33:12.625
- I meant...
- ( Laughs ) I know
what you meant.

33:12.625 --> 33:14.541
And I know
you ain't them.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.666
I don't know much,

33:18.666 --> 33:21.416
but I would wager
that God

33:21.416 --> 33:23.625
will put you far ahead
of Sister Clarice

33:23.625 --> 33:26.833
when it comes to passing
through the pearly gates.

33:29.625 --> 33:31.541
Ah, she'll have one.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.375
- ( groans )
- ( Laughs )

33:35.125 --> 33:36.833
( whimpering )

33:36.833 --> 33:38.666
Doctor:
How long have you
been bleeding?

33:38.666 --> 33:40.333
On and off for
the last few months.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.958
And this didn't occur
with your previous
pregnancies?

33:42.958 --> 33:45.291
Not with any
of the other five.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.166
Is there a problem?

33:47.166 --> 33:50.583
Your lower uterine wall
has thickened.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.416
And that, I'm afraid,
is your placenta
out of place.

33:55.416 --> 33:57.500
Should I call
for the surgeons?

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
Yes. No.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.416
Someone else.

34:18.666 --> 34:21.833
- ( knocks )
- Dr. Thackery.
Bellevue just called.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.250
We got one.
It's coming in right now.

34:34.000 --> 34:35.166
( scrubbing )

34:37.750 --> 34:39.416
Ready?

34:39.416 --> 34:41.416
Equipment is aseptic
and ready for use.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.000
Are you sure
we're ready?

34:46.000 --> 34:47.833
Having doubts?

34:49.083 --> 34:49.708
It's to be expected.

34:49.708 --> 34:53.125
Not from me.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.291
How can you be
so certain?

34:57.875 --> 35:00.416
Perhaps a few more
trials with the...

35:00.416 --> 35:02.833
female subjects.

35:02.833 --> 35:04.875
I could help pay
for their time.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.041
I miss them, too.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.958
They are more proof of God
than anything else

35:08.958 --> 35:10.416
I've ever seen
on this Earth,

35:10.416 --> 35:13.083
but their usefulness to us,
at least medically,

35:13.083 --> 35:15.833
has passed.

35:15.833 --> 35:17.583
What you choose
to do with them

35:17.583 --> 35:19.166
on your own time
is entirely up to you.

35:33.041 --> 35:36.666
Dr. Chickering
is now inserting
the deflated bladder,

35:36.666 --> 35:39.458
which is sheathed
to keep the shape small

35:39.458 --> 35:42.125
while entering
the vaginal canal.

36:06.416 --> 36:09.333
We are now entering
the uterus.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.125
With this new procedure,

36:11.125 --> 36:12.791
there is no danger
of exsanguination,

36:12.791 --> 36:16.333
as our bladder

36:16.333 --> 36:19.375
has slowed the bleeding
to a trickle.

36:20.916 --> 36:22.416
Retractors.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.916
( baby crying )

36:52.250 --> 36:54.291
The baby is alive.

36:54.291 --> 36:58.333
The patient will live
to mother it.

36:58.333 --> 37:00.916
Gentlemen,

37:00.916 --> 37:03.083
I give you
the Christiansen-

37:03.083 --> 37:06.041
Thackery-Chickering.

37:06.041 --> 37:08.250
Placental Repair.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.875
( applause )

37:15.208 --> 37:17.166
( liquid pouring )

37:33.291 --> 37:34.208
Bertie.

37:38.250 --> 37:41.791
To Dr. Jules
Christiansen...

37:42.833 --> 37:44.166
who deserves to be
here with us.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.708
Ah.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.958
Is the paper finished?

37:56.958 --> 37:58.833
Almost.

37:58.833 --> 38:01.208
I left some
of my notes in the lab.

38:02.416 --> 38:05.541
- Should I fetch them?
- No, no, no, I'll go.

38:05.541 --> 38:07.208
You should go home,
get some rest.

38:08.583 --> 38:12.291
Have breakfast
with your father

38:12.291 --> 38:14.125
and tell him all about
how you'll soon be
a published surgeon.

38:16.291 --> 38:20.208
- Good night, Doctor.
- Night, Bertie.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.250
( pencil scratching )

38:49.708 --> 38:53.083
( man coughing )

39:40.000 --> 39:42.750
What the hell is this?

39:44.333 --> 39:46.500
Edwards:
...how long the wax
has been impacted in there.

39:46.500 --> 39:49.958
But that sodium bicarbonate
solution should help loosen...

39:52.083 --> 39:54.458
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

39:54.458 --> 39:57.041
I sincerely hope
I'm in a state of delirium

39:57.041 --> 39:58.416
because this cannot be
what it appears.

39:58.416 --> 40:00.875
- Get them out of here.
- Just let me...

40:00.875 --> 40:03.291
Out, Edwards, now!

40:07.583 --> 40:10.125
This way.

40:34.125 --> 40:37.333
The unbelievable brass
on you to think you
can run a clinic

40:37.333 --> 40:39.791
for Negroes in my
hospital like some goddamn
Underground Railroad.

40:39.791 --> 40:42.458
Full disclosure?

40:42.458 --> 40:47.541
It is much, much more
than just a clinic.

40:47.541 --> 40:49.333
What do you mean?

41:22.166 --> 41:26.250
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

41:26.250 --> 41:29.291
These people needed help
and I needed to do it.

41:29.291 --> 41:33.125
This goes beyond
disobedience into
outright negligence.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.833
I was never
anything of the sort.

41:34.833 --> 41:37.541
Stolen equipment,
unregistered patients,

41:37.541 --> 41:40.250
procedures performed
in unsterile conditions

41:40.250 --> 41:42.250
with unqualified people.

41:44.250 --> 41:46.083
I hope you don't believe
that your association

41:46.083 --> 41:49.791
with the Robertsons will
save you from termination.

41:49.791 --> 41:53.166
What was I supposed to do?

41:53.166 --> 41:55.458
Huh?

41:55.458 --> 41:58.541
Wait around for you
to allow me into your
lily-white theater?

41:59.750 --> 42:01.125
You are a man
of science.

42:01.125 --> 42:03.916
Show me...
show me any proof

42:03.916 --> 42:06.583
that says that
I should not be allowed

42:06.583 --> 42:08.958
to work alongside you
as an equal.

42:08.958 --> 42:10.458
This is not about
a disparity

42:10.458 --> 42:12.541
between the ability
of blacks and whites.

42:12.541 --> 42:15.958
This is about lies.
It's about duplicity.

42:15.958 --> 42:17.875
This is about
your lack of morality.

42:17.875 --> 42:19.041
Morality?

42:19.041 --> 42:21.125
Morality from a man
whose own morality

42:21.125 --> 42:24.416
allows sick
and desperate people
to be turned away

42:24.416 --> 42:26.875
because he believes them
to be less human than he.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.583
Edwards,
you are finished.

42:31.791 --> 42:33.708
These people
cannot stay here.

42:33.708 --> 42:35.708
You find them
another place to go.

42:35.708 --> 42:37.458
Yes, sir.

42:44.500 --> 42:45.291
What is this?

42:47.625 --> 42:48.125
It's for suctioning.

42:52.625 --> 42:54.166
No cranking?

42:54.166 --> 42:56.250
No.
Frees up a hand.

42:59.791 --> 43:01.583
Did you invent this?

43:03.208 --> 43:06.291
Modified it
from an existing product.

43:09.083 --> 43:11.041
( motor humming )

43:15.791 --> 43:17.291
( turns off )

43:19.166 --> 43:21.458
That's not the only
thing I've come up
with down here.

43:33.791 --> 43:34.958
My solution

43:34.958 --> 43:37.875
for the inguinal hernia.

43:46.333 --> 43:48.541
I then separate the cord
from the sac

43:48.541 --> 43:51.583
and continue for one-half
inch around the inside
of the interior ring.

43:51.583 --> 43:53.875
And what happens
if you find

43:53.875 --> 43:55.250
that the hernia
is congenital?

43:55.250 --> 43:58.041
I separate a strip
from the back,

43:58.041 --> 43:59.625
the bottom of the sac
from the rest,

43:59.625 --> 44:01.333
and catch the cord
and the testicle

44:01.333 --> 44:02.708
using a continuous
silver suture.

44:02.708 --> 44:06.666
- Silver?
- It has incredible
holding power.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.791
Where'd you find
silver suture?

44:10.791 --> 44:12.333
Another item
I had modified.

44:18.666 --> 44:22.291
How many hernia patients
have you seen?

44:22.291 --> 44:24.291
They're not hard to find

44:24.291 --> 44:26.958
considering most
of the jobs colored
folks can get

44:26.958 --> 44:29.291
involve heavy lifting.

44:29.291 --> 44:30.708
How many have you lost?

44:30.708 --> 44:33.375
- One.
- One?

44:33.375 --> 44:36.958
Mm-hmm. And solely
because he disregarded
my instructions

44:36.958 --> 44:39.625
to refrain from
strenuous activity.

44:39.625 --> 44:42.708
Did you come up
with the idea for
this booklet as well?

44:42.708 --> 44:44.000
I did.
It was easier
than relying

44:44.000 --> 44:46.125
on my staff down here
to take all my notes.

44:46.125 --> 44:47.500
Where'd you get
the camera?

44:47.500 --> 44:49.875
I bought it, like most
of what you see down here.

44:49.875 --> 44:51.041
One of the reasons
I'm still living
at that hotel.

44:51.041 --> 44:54.916
My salary got diverted.

44:54.916 --> 44:58.416
You endangered
your entire career
with this stunt.

44:58.416 --> 45:00.291
What if it wasn't me
that stumbled across you?

45:00.291 --> 45:02.291
What if it was Barrow
or Gallinger?

45:02.291 --> 45:05.958
Right, because you
were so charitable
when you discovered me.

45:05.958 --> 45:08.375
I never planned on this
going as far as it has.

45:08.375 --> 45:10.291
It started with me wanting
to help one or two people.

45:10.291 --> 45:11.958
And once the discoveries
began, it...

45:11.958 --> 45:14.666
You had to see it
all the way through.
I understand.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.125
You know, this is good.

45:19.583 --> 45:21.083
This is better than good.

45:21.083 --> 45:23.916
So where do we go
from here?

45:23.916 --> 45:25.875
Well, all of this ends.

45:25.875 --> 45:28.625
But not until these people
are fully recovered.

45:28.625 --> 45:31.708
And until then,
I should be able to treat
my other patients as well.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.541
You just make sure
you keep that door locked

45:36.541 --> 45:38.750
so that no one else
stumbles in here.

45:41.916 --> 45:44.791
What about my findings?

45:48.083 --> 45:49.916
Well, I think
we'll be making that

45:49.916 --> 45:52.833
the new standard
hernia procedure.

45:54.166 --> 45:57.541
Well, if it's
the standard here,

45:57.541 --> 45:59.916
shouldn't it be
the standard everywhere?

45:59.916 --> 46:02.791
Meaning you want this
to be published?

46:02.791 --> 46:06.791
Oh, I could never get
published in this country
on my own.

46:06.791 --> 46:09.333
But if I had
a co-author...

46:09.333 --> 46:13.166
Oh, you want me
to co-author with
you on this?

46:13.166 --> 46:15.541
As lead or as equals?

46:15.541 --> 46:17.416
As long as it gets
my name out there,

46:17.416 --> 46:19.291
I don't care what
my accreditation is.

46:19.291 --> 46:21.083
And one more thing.

46:21.083 --> 46:24.291
I think it's time
I be allowed

46:24.291 --> 46:28.250
to work with you
officially in the theater

46:28.250 --> 46:31.916
as your deputy
chief of surgery.

46:31.916 --> 46:34.166
I don't want you
just to get me

46:34.166 --> 46:37.416
when you can't find
someone else.

46:37.416 --> 46:38.666
And if I don't
allow you?

46:38.666 --> 46:41.958
Then I'll take my future
discoveries elsewhere.

46:41.958 --> 46:45.291
And you will miss out
on all the fun.

46:47.958 --> 46:51.625
- Dr. Edwards.
- Hmm?

46:53.375 --> 46:59.000
May I officially
welcome you to the Knick?

47:04.208 --> 47:06.250
August:
Cards.

47:06.250 --> 47:09.875
That's a nice one.
And that is a nice one.

47:09.875 --> 47:11.500
Good evening,
gentlemen.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.375
Neely.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.208
Come to bring your dad
some good luck?

47:15.208 --> 47:16.875
Hobart's taken
all your inheritance.

47:16.875 --> 47:18.333
Is that true,
Mr. Showalter?

47:18.333 --> 47:20.000
Perhaps just
dented it a bit.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.541
You'll get it all back
when you and Phillip
are married.

47:21.541 --> 47:24.916
Is that an incentive
for me to keep
losing to you?

47:24.916 --> 47:27.250
Just look at me
as a conveyer of
your wealth

47:27.250 --> 47:28.958
to my future
daughter-in-law.

47:28.958 --> 47:31.416
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer to cut out
the middleman

47:31.416 --> 47:32.875
for the next
few hands.

47:32.875 --> 47:34.041
And how are you doing?

47:34.041 --> 47:35.833
Will we begin
our marriage penniless?

47:35.833 --> 47:38.125
No, only down a bit,
but to my father
and yours,

47:38.125 --> 47:40.333
so we'll likely
see it again.

47:40.333 --> 47:43.000
How's the Knick?
You still on the hunt?

47:43.000 --> 47:45.041
Oh, Cornelia's
been playing a bit
of detective

47:45.041 --> 47:45.916
alongside
a health inspector.

47:45.916 --> 47:48.625
We got our girl today.

47:48.625 --> 47:51.750
Inspector Speight and I
apprehended the suspect
this afternoon.

47:51.750 --> 47:53.875
Apprehended?
Listen to my girl.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.458
She sounds like
Big Bill Devery down
at police headquarters.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.333
( laughs )
You think she can be
bought as easily?

47:58.333 --> 47:59.875
( laughs )

47:59.875 --> 48:01.250
It was exciting,
Phillip,

48:01.250 --> 48:04.875
to get out
into the street
and do some good.

48:04.875 --> 48:08.500
I don't know.
It was wonderful
to feel so useful.

48:08.500 --> 48:11.625
What's wonderful
is to see such a flush
in your cheeks.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.375
Congratulations, Neely.

48:13.375 --> 48:15.250
An epidemic has been
averted because of you.

48:15.250 --> 48:17.916
- Yes.
- A toast
to my little girl.

48:17.916 --> 48:19.708
I agree.
To you, my love.

48:19.708 --> 48:22.041
Perfect way to wind down
your tenure at the Knick.

48:22.041 --> 48:24.375
My wife will always
have the best stories

48:24.375 --> 48:26.250
to tell her
lady friends at lunch.

48:26.250 --> 48:28.208
( chuckles )

48:29.708 --> 48:31.833
Well, thank you all.

48:31.833 --> 48:33.291
It's been a long day.

48:36.166 --> 48:38.666
- Good evening.
- Sweet dreams, dear.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.791
Phillip,
it's to you.

48:42.791 --> 48:46.000
- 100.
- Ooh!

49:03.958 --> 49:06.208
- ( knock on door )
- Come in, Gertrude.

49:08.083 --> 49:10.125
My dress is ready
to be hung.

49:21.125 --> 49:22.791
Mr. Showalter?

49:22.791 --> 49:25.166
Dear, I've known you
since you were born.

49:25.166 --> 49:27.208
You're going to be
my daughter.

49:27.208 --> 49:29.333
Why don't you start
calling me Dad?

49:29.333 --> 49:31.541
I don't think
your own father would
mind too terribly much,

49:31.541 --> 49:34.083
do you?

49:34.083 --> 49:36.250
Very well.

49:36.250 --> 49:38.166
I always wanted
a daughter.

49:38.166 --> 49:41.958
We lost two
in childbirth.

49:41.958 --> 49:44.166
I'm sorry.

49:44.166 --> 49:46.291
But now I have one
of my very own.

49:48.375 --> 49:50.125
I suppose
that's true.

49:50.125 --> 49:55.208
Phillip has given us
a beautiful,

49:55.208 --> 49:57.416
beautiful daughter in you.

49:57.416 --> 50:02.541
I've invested
a tremendous amount
of money with your father.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.750
I believe in the union
of our two families.

50:05.750 --> 50:07.041
I know he's grateful...

50:07.041 --> 50:09.208
I don't want
his gratitude.

50:09.208 --> 50:12.291
I did it because I believe
our coming together

50:12.291 --> 50:15.458
is a wonderful thing
that will provide

50:15.458 --> 50:18.333
rewards and pleasures
for all of us.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.375
Do you think it's
a wonderful thing, Neely?

50:23.916 --> 50:27.166
Of course,
Mr. Showalter.

50:27.166 --> 50:29.000
Dad.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.583
Open or closed?

50:46.583 --> 50:48.833
What?

50:48.833 --> 50:52.583
The door...
open or closed?

50:52.583 --> 50:54.875
Closed.

50:58.666 --> 51:00.416
Sleep tight.

51:03.833 --> 51:06.125
