WEBVTT

00:28.006 --> 00:30.019
Phil,
we're on the clock.

00:30.021 --> 00:33.023
If I want to hold
my woman's hand, I'm gonna hold
her goddamn hand.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.001
And if Sergeant walks in?

00:37.003 --> 00:38.003
Then he'll see us.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.001
And I'll resign.

00:43.018 --> 00:45.007
Here you are, honey.

00:45.009 --> 00:46.018
One earl grey.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.022
I know it's not
a ring, but...

00:53.005 --> 00:54.021
We're going
to make it there one day.

00:54.023 --> 00:56.007
On our honeymoon.

00:56.009 --> 00:58.011
We'll get out of this
freezing shit hole.

00:58.013 --> 01:01.018
All I want to do is drink
Pina Coladas
on a beach with you.

01:01.020 --> 01:04.022
Well, that's not all...

01:06.005 --> 01:08.006
I am a lucky man.

01:08.008 --> 01:10.004
Yes, you are.

01:12.003 --> 01:13.003
Happy anniversary.

01:38.016 --> 01:39.022
You think it's the chill?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.006
Sounds like the starter.

01:41.008 --> 01:42.012
Pop the hood.

01:57.012 --> 01:58.018
Phil!

02:00.013 --> 02:01.021
Drop your knife!

02:02.023 --> 02:03.022
Drop your knife!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.013
Don't touch anything.

02:55.009 --> 02:59.000
Don't worry, I would never
burn down your home.

02:59.002 --> 03:01.018
It's so quaint.

03:07.011 --> 03:10.004
I said don't
touch anything.

03:10.006 --> 03:11.017
<i>Hey.</i>

03:11.019 --> 03:13.000
You're back.

03:13.018 --> 03:14.016
With company...

03:14.018 --> 03:15.021
Kory's sister.

03:15.023 --> 03:18.010
Her homicidal sister.

03:19.004 --> 03:20.009
In our house.

03:20.011 --> 03:22.000
Koriand'r,

03:22.002 --> 03:24.018
I see you've prepared
a welcome gift.

03:24.020 --> 03:28.005
Have him washed
immediately and returned
to my chamber.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.020
Uh, yeah. What?

03:30.022 --> 03:34.006
Tamaran is a very
different planet.

03:34.008 --> 03:37.022
Clearly the strapping one
is my man servant,
here to attend to my needs.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.012
Sure. I can attend
to your needs.

03:39.014 --> 03:41.000
That's not what
she's talking about.

03:41.002 --> 03:43.022
No, no, we don't
do that here.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.006
Conner is not your chew toy.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.016
He's one of us.

03:47.018 --> 03:49.009
A Titan.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.004
But is the green one not yours?

03:54.015 --> 03:56.008
I'll need someone
to draw me a bath.

03:56.010 --> 03:59.002
-Where would that be?
-No one's gonna
draw you a bath.

03:59.004 --> 04:00.017
Upstairs. Pick a room.

04:10.002 --> 04:14.011
Wherever black fire goes,
chaos always follows.

04:14.013 --> 04:16.014
Sleep with one eye open.

05:30.015 --> 05:32.003
<i>That was
a warning shot.</i>

05:32.005 --> 05:33.011
Drop the vase.

05:35.015 --> 05:36.013
If you wish.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.008
Nope.

05:51.016 --> 05:52.019
Hmm.

06:05.007 --> 06:06.009
You're not running?

06:06.011 --> 06:08.000
Maybe I want to get caught.

06:14.017 --> 06:15.014
Barbara?

06:15.016 --> 06:17.004
Security here's a joke.

06:17.006 --> 06:19.013
It's my way of keeping
my dad on his toes.

06:24.019 --> 06:26.004
Wanna grab a drink?

06:31.023 --> 06:34.022
To being young
and more fun.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.013
Being young
and more fun.

06:37.014 --> 06:38.017
Here we go.

06:49.004 --> 06:50.012
Stronger than it looks.

06:52.008 --> 06:54.009
Mmm, kinda like me.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.001
Hey, can I ask you something?

06:58.017 --> 06:59.016
Anything.

07:01.001 --> 07:02.015
What's with
the Selina Kyle shit?

07:02.017 --> 07:03.023
You could get hurt.

07:05.005 --> 07:06.006
You wouldn't get it.

07:08.014 --> 07:11.003
When you look at me,
what do you see?

07:12.017 --> 07:13.023
Uh...

07:14.001 --> 07:15.023
You see Commissioner
Gordon's daughter.

07:16.001 --> 07:18.004
It's not what I was gonna say.

07:18.006 --> 07:20.011
Why not?
It's all anybody ever sees.

07:20.013 --> 07:23.003
The perfect daughter.

07:23.005 --> 07:25.002
That the test scores,
the pedigree.

07:25.004 --> 07:28.002
I might even take
after my dad one day.
Who knows?

07:29.002 --> 07:30.008
Doesn't sound so bad.

07:30.010 --> 07:33.015
Yeah, well,
I want to be more than that.

07:33.017 --> 07:37.003
I want to do good
in the world.
Actual good.

07:37.005 --> 07:41.019
All he ever does is fill out
incident reports
and dodge red tape.

07:41.021 --> 07:44.008
Fire up the bat signal
when things get dicey.

07:44.010 --> 07:45.020
Why don't you join
me and Bruce?

07:45.022 --> 07:47.016
You're halfway there.
He could teach you.

07:49.015 --> 07:52.002
Batman, Robin and...

07:53.016 --> 07:54.019
Robin girl.

07:58.013 --> 07:59.023
How about Batgirl?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.007
Robin Girl has
a nicer ring to it.

08:06.010 --> 08:10.015
That's sweet, but...
it's not really my thing.

08:10.017 --> 08:13.004
You guys work for my dad.

08:13.006 --> 08:15.005
You follow rules.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.018
I like to break them

08:21.007 --> 08:23.001
So what do you say,
Dick Grayson?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
You ready to break some rules?

08:29.016 --> 08:30.023
<i>In the past two weeks,</i>

08:31.001 --> 08:32.013
<i>a series
of high-tech robberies</i>

08:32.015 --> 08:35.001
<i>have swept across
Gotham's museums and galleries.</i>

08:35.003 --> 08:37.009
<i>Several of the city's
most prized works of art,</i>

08:37.011 --> 08:39.015
<i>artifacts and world-famous jewels</i>

08:39.017 --> 08:41.014
<i>have vanished
under cover of night.</i>

08:41.016 --> 08:44.008
<i>And now last night,
the prized Millennium necklace</i>

08:44.010 --> 08:47.008
<i>has been stolen
from Gotham's
Metropolitan Museum.</i>

08:47.010 --> 08:51.005
<i>It arrived just a week ago
on loan from a private
collection in Vienna.</i>

08:51.007 --> 08:53.017
<i>Commissioner Gordon stated
he was perplexed</i>

08:53.019 --> 08:57.009
<i>as to how so many sophisticated
security systems can be...</i>

08:58.014 --> 09:00.004
What you gonna
do with all this?

09:00.006 --> 09:01.023
<i>...for any
information they might have</i>

09:02.001 --> 09:03.015
<i>pertaining to the robberies.</i>

09:03.017 --> 09:05.008
Maybe we should give it back.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.013
What?

09:07.012 --> 09:08.013
No.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.013
Let's try it on.

09:13.021 --> 09:15.006
Let's see if you wanna
give it back now.

09:16.012 --> 09:17.014
Show me.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.008
It's heavy.

09:26.005 --> 09:27.011
It really suits you.

09:29.018 --> 09:31.010
Here.
Want it tighter?

09:31.012 --> 09:32.018
Yeah.

10:10.011 --> 10:11.010
Oh, my God.

10:12.013 --> 10:13.012
What did I do?

10:17.013 --> 10:18.020
<i>Sorry...</i>

10:29.023 --> 10:31.012
Oh, fuck.

10:55.008 --> 10:57.003
Dude,
that looks horrible.

10:57.005 --> 10:59.020
Five inches over
and we'd be burying
another body.

10:59.022 --> 11:01.016
Barbara's responsible
for this?

11:03.003 --> 11:04.017
One of her snipers is. Yeah.

11:06.010 --> 11:08.015
On her orders, I'm sure.

11:08.017 --> 11:10.017
Maybe I should go
and have a word with her.

11:10.019 --> 11:13.020
I think there's been
enough bloodshed for today.

11:15.009 --> 11:16.019
That was way too close, man.

11:16.021 --> 11:17.018
I almost had him.

11:17.020 --> 11:20.000
You're not listening, Dick!

11:20.002 --> 11:21.006
You scared us.

11:21.008 --> 11:22.020
Going out on your own,
getting shot.

11:22.022 --> 11:23.022
It's not okay.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.001
I didn't want
to put you guys at risk.

11:27.003 --> 11:29.007
-Oh, bullshit, Grayson.
-Excuse me?

11:29.009 --> 11:31.007
Dude, Hank blew up!

11:31.009 --> 11:34.009
Dawn left us forever,
and Jason went dark.

11:34.011 --> 11:38.016
This family is dying
and you go out alone
and get yourself shot?

11:41.014 --> 11:43.022
Do you even hear the words
coming out of your mouth?

11:44.000 --> 11:45.003
Gar!

11:46.005 --> 11:47.009
What?

11:47.023 --> 11:49.005
Take ten.

11:55.017 --> 11:58.006
-Thanks.
-Where are you going?

12:01.005 --> 12:02.008
I'm going to go find him.

12:02.010 --> 12:03.016
You lost a lot of blood.

12:03.018 --> 12:05.000
You need to take it easy.

12:07.004 --> 12:08.022
I'm all right.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Dick, before you go upstairs
there's something
I need to tell you.

12:11.002 --> 12:12.018
Does it involve catching
Red Hood and Scarecrow?

12:12.020 --> 12:15.000
-No.
-Then I'll hear about it later.

12:16.008 --> 12:17.008
Fuck.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.005
Can you hand me a knife?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.022
Are you sure?

12:34.007 --> 12:36.009
Didn't my sister tell you
I'm dangerous?

12:37.009 --> 12:38.022
Pretty sure I can take you.

12:40.022 --> 12:42.012
Let's test that theory.

12:44.009 --> 12:45.006
Nice throw.

12:51.018 --> 12:53.001
Let's eat.

13:02.011 --> 13:04.007
Let's just put the shit
out on the streets.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.008
Who the fuck cares
if it's a perfect dose.

13:06.010 --> 13:07.020
I care. You should, too.

13:07.022 --> 13:09.012
Why? It works.

13:09.014 --> 13:12.002
-I'm Exhibit One.
-Exhibit A.

13:12.004 --> 13:16.000
Something's submitted as
primary evidence in support
of a proposition or argument.

13:16.002 --> 13:17.012
Exactly.

13:17.014 --> 13:20.002
I exhibited the fuck out of it,
so let's step it up.

13:20.004 --> 13:23.010
There's a greater plan at work,
padawan learner.
Mysteries to be revealed.

13:23.012 --> 13:26.004
There's no plan
without my okay.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.004
And I say let's go
and fuck up Dick.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.019
I get you.

13:34.021 --> 13:36.020
You know, you're excited
to see what the next step is.

13:36.022 --> 13:39.004
But before that,
I want you to come with me.

13:39.006 --> 13:41.014
There's something
I want to show you that...

13:41.016 --> 13:43.009
might shed some light
on things.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.019
I used to come here during
lunch when I was a med student.

14:30.021 --> 14:35.000
<i>There's nothing like pairing
an egg salad sandwich
with a Craniotomy.</i>

14:35.002 --> 14:37.010
Cool.
Can we go now?

14:37.012 --> 14:40.021
Now, hang a second,
there's been
a shift in dynamics,

14:40.023 --> 14:44.011
and I blame myself
for not being more transparent.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.018
About what?

14:46.020 --> 14:50.006
Exhibit B, or as a lesser man
may say number two.

15:34.022 --> 15:36.011
You are expendable.

15:37.017 --> 15:39.023
Gotham is an open city now.

15:40.001 --> 15:41.016
So I brought in this
lovely specimen

15:41.018 --> 15:43.011
to help me with a few errands

15:43.013 --> 15:46.004
that are near and dear
to my heart.

15:46.006 --> 15:48.008
If you are unhappy,
there are others

15:48.010 --> 15:50.020
who are more than willing
to take up the cause.

15:51.016 --> 15:52.017
<i>Comprende?</i>

15:55.009 --> 15:56.012
Good talk.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.005
-What are you doing?
-The dishes.

16:11.007 --> 16:12.017
Is that your role here?

16:12.019 --> 16:14.006
We all do the dishes,

16:14.008 --> 16:16.005
and the cooking,
and the laundry,
and everything else.

16:16.007 --> 16:17.021
This is a disgrace.
We are queens.

16:17.023 --> 16:19.020
Twenty four hours ago,
you were a prisoner.

16:19.022 --> 16:22.018
I think this is
a major step up.

16:22.020 --> 16:25.008
Freedom means nothing if you
choose to live like a servant.

16:25.010 --> 16:27.010
Okay, let's get
something straight.

16:29.005 --> 16:31.020
These people are my friends.

16:31.022 --> 16:35.001
You will treat them
and this place with respect.

16:36.018 --> 16:38.008
No more knives.

16:38.010 --> 16:39.017
And if I catch

16:39.019 --> 16:42.003
even a whisper of a scheme
out of your mouth,

16:42.005 --> 16:44.021
I will drop you down the hole
I found you in.

16:47.011 --> 16:48.017
Are we clear...

16:48.019 --> 16:50.009
-...Queen?

16:50.011 --> 16:51.020
There's been
a development in...

16:53.006 --> 16:54.002
Oh.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.005
-Didn't know we had a guest.
Yeah.

16:57.007 --> 16:59.013
That's the thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

16:59.015 --> 17:00.019
Blackfire.

17:02.005 --> 17:03.018
Pleasure's yours.

17:03.020 --> 17:06.006
-Blackfire. You're--
-Yes.

17:06.008 --> 17:08.003
The person who
killed your boyfriend

17:08.022 --> 17:10.000
and your parents.

17:11.008 --> 17:12.008
In our kitchen.

17:15.003 --> 17:16.009
It's a long story.

17:17.006 --> 17:18.005
What were you saying?

17:18.007 --> 17:19.018
Listen, there was an attack.

17:19.020 --> 17:22.005
Thomas and Martha Wayne
Memorial Hospital.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.017
The surgical team was killed,

17:23.019 --> 17:25.006
and a piece of
medical equipment went missing.

17:25.008 --> 17:27.004
They found a drug inhaler
at the crime scene.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.017
Let's go.

17:29.019 --> 17:31.010
You just got shot.

17:33.005 --> 17:35.004
Bruce got shot all the time.
Didn't stop him.

17:35.006 --> 17:37.011
Look how well that went.

17:37.013 --> 17:39.009
Then I guess I'll just have
to do better.

17:40.018 --> 17:41.019
Let's go.

17:42.022 --> 17:44.007
I understand now.

17:44.009 --> 17:46.016
The tiny green one
isn't your man servant.

17:46.018 --> 17:47.022
Clearly, he

17:48.000 --> 17:49.011
-satisfies your urges.

17:54.011 --> 17:56.005
Gar texted
the name of the machine.

17:56.007 --> 17:58.014
A short wave
positron multiplier.

17:58.016 --> 17:59.018
The kid who they were
operating on

17:59.020 --> 18:01.010
needed it for his procedure.

18:01.012 --> 18:02.022
Is he still angry at me?

18:03.000 --> 18:04.002
Gar?

18:04.004 --> 18:06.011
Oh, it's fear
disguised as anger.

18:06.013 --> 18:08.022
He's just worried about you.
He doesn't want you get hurt.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.011
Well, it's part of the job.

18:10.013 --> 18:12.008
Yeah, well, most people
are scared by that.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.017
You're just
not like most people.

18:13.019 --> 18:15.010
I have Bruce Wayne
to thank for that.

18:15.012 --> 18:17.013
And now Crane is doing
the same thing with Jason.

18:17.015 --> 18:19.004
Question is,
what kind of twisted plan

18:19.006 --> 18:20.015
does he have for that machine?

18:20.017 --> 18:22.008
Obviously he's not looking
to save sick kids.

18:22.010 --> 18:23.020
And who is this new accomplice?

18:23.022 --> 18:25.016
Witness I spoke to
said the killer was a woman.

18:25.018 --> 18:27.003
Blond hair, bad attitude.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.007
The only person she spared
was the patient.

18:30.005 --> 18:32.001
You Dick Grayson? Kory Anders?

18:32.003 --> 18:33.007
How did you know?

18:33.009 --> 18:34.018
You're not allowed access.

18:36.006 --> 18:37.008
On whose orders?

18:37.010 --> 18:38.016
Barbara Gordon's.

18:45.004 --> 18:48.000
So that partnership seems to be
off to a great start.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.010
Gunshot wound and a cock block,

18:49.012 --> 18:51.001
and we're
not even at lunch yet.

18:51.003 --> 18:53.008
We don't need her to track down
who's working with Crane.

18:53.010 --> 18:54.016
It wouldn't hurt.

18:54.018 --> 18:56.009
Look, I don't know
all the gory details

18:56.011 --> 18:58.012
between you and Barbara.
I don't want to.

18:58.014 --> 18:59.020
I've got my own problems.

18:59.022 --> 19:02.006
But Crane, Jason,
and now this new killer.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.013
We cannot track them down

19:03.015 --> 19:05.015
with one hand
tied behind our back.

19:05.017 --> 19:06.022
You and Barbara...

19:07.022 --> 19:08.022
Fix it.

19:35.021 --> 19:37.014
Yeah.
I'll take care of it.

19:39.014 --> 19:41.013
You gonna shoot me again?

19:41.015 --> 19:43.000
This is more your range.

19:44.005 --> 19:45.023
How bad?

19:46.001 --> 19:48.008
Looks worse than it is,
went clean through.

19:49.015 --> 19:51.014
-Are you hurt?
-A little.

19:52.011 --> 19:53.011
Good.

19:57.021 --> 20:00.003
You know, I had 'em both,
Crane and Red Hood.

20:00.005 --> 20:01.010
Don't put this on me.

20:01.012 --> 20:04.001
You went off book.
Way off book.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.003
All this would be over if you
had just stayed out of it.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.012
Thanks to you,

20:07.014 --> 20:09.000
I've got a high-value prisoner
on the loose,

20:09.002 --> 20:10.020
and the BOP gunning
for my resignation.

20:10.022 --> 20:12.006
So before you start...

20:12.008 --> 20:13.016
Okay, just...

20:13.018 --> 20:16.001
We both made
some mistakes yesterday.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.023
-Are you apologizing?
-I'm explaining.

20:20.001 --> 20:22.009
I had a strong hunch
about Crane.

20:22.011 --> 20:24.003
I didn't tell you
because the whole plan

20:24.005 --> 20:26.010
would have fallen apart if he
suspected GCPD involvement.

20:26.012 --> 20:28.021
Well, your strong hunch led
to Crane going AWOL

20:28.023 --> 20:30.006
with a known terrorist.

20:30.008 --> 20:33.017
So, maybe trust your
intuition a little less.

20:38.002 --> 20:40.009
I came here because we need
to start working together.

20:40.011 --> 20:42.015
Right,
because history shows

20:42.017 --> 20:44.018
that we've
worked great together.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.017
Oh, come on, Barb, we got to be
on the same side here,

20:46.019 --> 20:48.021
-because if we're not,
this whole city--
-I know!

20:50.008 --> 20:51.012
I get it.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.018
Same team.

21:03.016 --> 21:05.015
I spotted surveillance
at the hospital yesterday.

21:05.017 --> 21:07.002
You got anything on it?

21:07.004 --> 21:09.011
The killer disabled
the OR video feed.

21:09.013 --> 21:11.013
We were only able
to recover the audio,

21:11.015 --> 21:12.022
which is useless.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.020
So, unless you
have any other ideas...

21:15.022 --> 21:17.006
I have one idea.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.010
-Don't say it.
-Oracle.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.023
Is that what this
routine's all been about?

21:23.001 --> 21:24.023
This is Red Hood and Scarecrow.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.019
We can use Oracle's
voice recognition

21:26.021 --> 21:28.012
to tap into Gotham's
phone network.

21:28.014 --> 21:31.012
Oracle has been mothballed
for a reason.

21:31.014 --> 21:33.001
I'm the only one with access,

21:33.003 --> 21:35.000
and I'm not revisiting
that monster.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.023
Not for you. Not ever.

21:38.002 --> 21:39.000
All right.

21:40.011 --> 21:43.020
This is exactly why
I'm against vigilantes.

21:43.022 --> 21:45.008
They think they're
above the law.

21:45.010 --> 21:48.017
Kidnapping prisoners,
using them as bait.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.000
Okay, fair enough.

21:52.018 --> 21:53.020
How can I help?

21:55.017 --> 21:57.010
You really want
to help?

22:03.008 --> 22:04.013
Go home.

22:06.010 --> 22:07.013
Okay.

22:13.017 --> 22:15.005
Why is
a piece of medical equipment

22:15.007 --> 22:16.022
behind a massive
government firewall?

22:17.000 --> 22:18.021
'Cause it's not just
a piece of medical equipment,

22:18.023 --> 22:20.017
it's a shortwave
positron multiplier.

22:20.019 --> 22:22.002
-Which is what?
I don't know,

22:22.004 --> 22:23.014
but it sounds super-impressive.

22:29.010 --> 22:31.001
We need to figure out
what Crane wants with it.

22:31.003 --> 22:32.005
Ugh.

22:33.005 --> 22:34.019
Something to add?

22:35.013 --> 22:37.005
Yes, sister.

22:37.007 --> 22:39.007
Look at the way you're
going about this.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.023
This is clearly
an expensive piece
of machinery.

22:42.001 --> 22:43.019
He may be trying to sell it
on the black market.

22:43.021 --> 22:45.015
Not likely.
Crane isn't motivated by cash.

22:45.017 --> 22:47.004
Then find out
what the rats are up to

22:47.006 --> 22:49.011
on the ground level,
the sources on the street.

22:50.022 --> 22:52.009
Or maybe you're

22:52.011 --> 22:56.001
more comfortable taking orders
from others...

22:56.003 --> 22:59.001
rather than taking
the initiative yourself.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.005
Kory.

23:05.001 --> 23:06.012
-We're in.
-The inventor.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.002
Doctor Christine Vo.

23:09.004 --> 23:11.002
Map says she's deep in Gotham.

23:38.012 --> 23:40.023
Worst taste in music ever.

23:41.001 --> 23:42.019
I see some things never change.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.003
You stay in the car.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.011
Why did you even bring me
to your home

23:45.013 --> 23:47.013
if you don't want my help?

23:47.015 --> 23:48.020
Just because
I didn't let you die

23:48.022 --> 23:50.003
doesn't mean you're part
of the team.

23:50.005 --> 23:51.015
Then what are you even doing
with me?

23:51.017 --> 23:53.023
I have
no fucking idea, Blackfire.

23:54.001 --> 23:56.008
I can't leave you alone
at Wayne Manor.

23:56.010 --> 23:58.002
I can't send you back
to Tamaran,

23:58.004 --> 23:59.023
you blew up my spaceship.

24:00.001 --> 24:01.003
And I can't kill you.

24:01.005 --> 24:02.014
So that leaves us here.

24:04.023 --> 24:07.008
Stay in the car, you watch her.

24:26.010 --> 24:27.012
Hello?

24:33.019 --> 24:35.001
Anybody home?

25:21.021 --> 25:24.005
I thought your idea was good...

25:24.007 --> 25:26.011
about getting intel
from the people on the street.

25:26.013 --> 25:28.004
Why are you sitting next to me?

25:29.012 --> 25:30.019
I could use the company.

25:31.021 --> 25:34.004
I don't like labs.
Bad memories.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.004
Hmm. Ditto.

25:39.020 --> 25:42.018
So, what's Tamaran like?

25:46.004 --> 25:47.021
Not like Earth.

25:47.023 --> 25:50.010
There's no open skies,
no flowing water.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.001
The very air burns your skin.

25:54.022 --> 25:56.012
I miss that burn.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.006
Why would you miss that?

25:58.008 --> 26:01.010
We made life prosper
from nothing but dust.

26:01.012 --> 26:04.000
Kory never appreciated Tamaran
when she had it.

26:05.019 --> 26:07.018
Have you heard stories
of Krypton?

26:08.014 --> 26:11.011
Wait. How did you know?

26:11.013 --> 26:12.020
I can see
the strength of Krypton

26:12.022 --> 26:14.005
running in your blood.

26:15.016 --> 26:17.003
And something else.

26:19.016 --> 26:23.006
I'm, uh, half-Kryptonian

26:23.008 --> 26:24.021
and half-human.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.004
Hmm. Neither here nor there.

26:28.006 --> 26:30.016
I have empathy
for that struggle.

26:30.018 --> 26:34.000
I was an alien,
even on my own home planet.

26:34.002 --> 26:35.013
That must have been lonely.

26:36.008 --> 26:37.020
It was.

26:37.022 --> 26:40.021
All I ever wanted was the power
that Koriand'r wielded.

26:44.001 --> 26:44.022
Fire.

26:47.004 --> 26:49.015
Every royal is born with it
except me.

26:50.010 --> 26:51.016
The cursed child.

26:53.007 --> 26:55.002
I was treated
as less than a worm.

26:56.020 --> 26:57.023
Now I know...

26:58.021 --> 27:00.013
it wasn't power I coveted.

27:03.008 --> 27:04.020
It was acceptance.

27:06.017 --> 27:08.013
The Titans took me in.

27:08.015 --> 27:10.020
Maybe they could
take you in too.

27:10.022 --> 27:12.014
We're a family.

27:12.016 --> 27:15.001
-A family
that doesn't share blood?

27:16.006 --> 27:18.016
They've got my back.
No matter what.

27:19.016 --> 27:20.020
We care for each other,

27:20.022 --> 27:23.018
and when they're happy,
I'm happy.

27:25.020 --> 27:27.007
Even my sister?

27:27.009 --> 27:28.019
Yeah, even Kory.

27:29.019 --> 27:30.016
It's just...

27:32.010 --> 27:34.010
you have to earn
your way into this family.

27:53.015 --> 27:54.016
Are you okay?

27:55.019 --> 27:57.012
The same bomb used on Hank.

27:57.014 --> 27:58.010
Conner!

28:01.001 --> 28:02.005
Thirty-one beats.
What do we do?

28:02.007 --> 28:03.015
Make a deactivator.

28:03.017 --> 28:04.021
No one's gonna die this time.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.013
Status.

28:15.015 --> 28:17.009
80% chance of failure.

28:17.011 --> 28:19.017
-Eighty?
-You'll be fine, okay?

28:19.019 --> 28:21.005
That's Superboy over there.

28:22.016 --> 28:23.021
Forty-five.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.003
Twenty.

28:30.007 --> 28:31.011
Done.

28:36.006 --> 28:37.020
Thank you.

28:37.022 --> 28:38.020
We got it.

28:41.004 --> 28:42.013
Do you have any idea
what Dr. Bell was

28:42.015 --> 28:43.018
talking about in there?

28:43.020 --> 28:45.002
Uh, that stuff about

28:45.004 --> 28:46.022
still being
in love with her ex-husband?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.005
No, the machine Crane stole.

28:49.007 --> 28:50.020
Oh, the SPM, yeah.

28:52.003 --> 28:53.007
Can you elaborate?

28:55.004 --> 28:57.006
Sure. The shortwave
positron multiplier

28:57.008 --> 28:59.010
is used to cure kids with RPPD.

28:59.012 --> 29:01.022
It could multiply almost
any chemical compound

29:02.000 --> 29:03.019
with pulses
of high-energy positrons

29:03.021 --> 29:05.016
resulting in
oxidative reactions

29:05.018 --> 29:07.014
in the pentose
phosphate pathway.

29:07.016 --> 29:10.001
Okay, so what does
Crane want with it?

29:10.003 --> 29:11.015
That's a good question.

29:11.017 --> 29:13.002
Well, if only

29:13.004 --> 29:14.021
we had a criminal mastermind
who could tell us.

29:16.007 --> 29:17.012
Or half of one.

29:19.013 --> 29:21.003
Right. Well,

29:21.005 --> 29:24.002
if I were an evil genius,

29:24.004 --> 29:25.011
I guess I could
alter the machine

29:25.013 --> 29:27.011
to multiply other chemicals.

29:27.013 --> 29:31.002
Whatever I wanted more of,
I could have, and fast.

29:31.004 --> 29:33.012
So whatever Crane was doing
before he went into Arkham,

29:33.014 --> 29:34.019
he's back at it again.

29:34.021 --> 29:36.020
But up to what?
What's he trying to make?

29:36.022 --> 29:40.003
Don't ask me.
I'm not the mastermind-- Fuck!

29:40.005 --> 29:41.010
Ugh. Get in the car.

29:51.013 --> 29:53.016
Okay. How much further
to the evidence room?

29:57.011 --> 29:59.001
Twenty-five meters.

29:59.003 --> 30:00.012
<i>Twenty-five meters.
Do I go left or straight?</i>

30:02.010 --> 30:03.009
Left.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.021
Does Barbara know
you're in there?

30:04.023 --> 30:07.015
We're at
a bit of an impasse.

30:07.017 --> 30:10.013
Once we get the audio tapes
from the hospital, I'll...

30:11.006 --> 30:12.007
I'll let her know.

30:15.005 --> 30:17.002
<i>Are you okay?</i>

30:17.004 --> 30:19.007
<i>If you want to talk
about something, I'm all ears.</i>

30:22.010 --> 30:23.009
Or not.

30:26.022 --> 30:28.007
Dick, I got to ask.

30:29.018 --> 30:30.022
Back at the cabin...

30:32.003 --> 30:33.001
<i>What about it?</i>

30:35.002 --> 30:36.013
Were you going to kill Jason?

30:38.015 --> 30:40.019
What makes you say that?

30:40.021 --> 30:43.015
Batman went off on his own
and killed the Joker.

30:43.017 --> 30:46.008
-You went off on your own and--
<i>Gar,</i>

30:46.010 --> 30:48.014
<i>Gotham got to Bruce.</i>

30:48.016 --> 30:50.003
And it gets to me too.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
No. I don't want
to have to kill Jason.

30:58.010 --> 31:01.000
I just...

31:01.002 --> 31:02.016
I just don't understand.

31:03.007 --> 31:04.011
Why'd he go bad?

31:04.013 --> 31:06.016
<i>He had a tough life.</i>

31:06.018 --> 31:08.021
That's what
Bruce looked for.

31:08.023 --> 31:10.018
Someone with anger.

31:10.020 --> 31:13.009
Someone he could
make into a weapon.

31:13.011 --> 31:15.011
But Crane's manipulating him.

31:16.018 --> 31:18.002
Look, I have to believe that

31:18.004 --> 31:20.010
this dude we
fought alongside, my friend...

31:21.010 --> 31:23.021
That he's not all bad.

31:24.023 --> 31:26.021
What if is this
is not his fault?

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
What if it is?

31:32.002 --> 31:33.016
We don't know.

31:36.016 --> 31:38.008
<i>Okay, where am I at, now?</i>

31:39.014 --> 31:41.014
Above the storage room.

31:41.016 --> 31:43.015
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

31:55.015 --> 31:57.009
Commissioner?

31:57.011 --> 32:01.012
Gotham Gazette, Chanel Five
GNN, all down our throats
about Crane.

32:01.014 --> 32:02.021
What should I tell them?

32:06.021 --> 32:07.016
Gotcha.

32:07.018 --> 32:09.015
No comment.

32:22.013 --> 32:23.021
Holy shit.

32:37.009 --> 32:38.020
<i>Barbara?</i>

32:38.022 --> 32:40.016
<i>-It's me.</i>
-Bruce?

32:40.018 --> 32:44.001
<i>I'll be where it all started.
Come quickly.</i>

32:46.018 --> 32:49.016
<i>And, Barbara.
Don't tell Dick.</i>

33:03.018 --> 33:05.000
I want the drug.

33:07.020 --> 33:09.013
We're not finished yet.

33:09.015 --> 33:11.004
All- All we have
is a skinny batch.

33:11.006 --> 33:13.006
You give me that, then.
All of it.

33:13.008 --> 33:15.007
We've been taking orders
from Crane.

33:15.009 --> 33:16.016
We thought he was the boss.

33:19.001 --> 33:20.012
Who's the boss again?

33:23.010 --> 33:26.000
We have audio
from the murders,
but no visual.

33:26.002 --> 33:29.014
Bruce and I
used to do this together,
part of my training.

33:29.016 --> 33:30.020
Join me.

34:00.023 --> 34:03.012
The killer was 12 feet
north east of the surgeon.

34:04.006 --> 34:05.009
Knife throw.

34:05.011 --> 34:08.017
What? A 12-foot,
precision-targeted throw?

34:09.014 --> 34:10.023
Was that an assassin?

34:14.015 --> 34:16.008
Sliced across the back.

34:16.010 --> 34:18.003
Our killer has the ability
to kill quickly,

34:18.005 --> 34:20.001
but likes to savor
the victim's pain.

34:20.003 --> 34:21.006
Sounds personal.

34:29.019 --> 34:32.020
Okay, take a seven-inch blade,
and do a horizontal slash
from West to East.

34:43.017 --> 34:45.011
Okay, one more time.

34:45.013 --> 34:48.010
Sixteen-inch blade,
reverse quick flash.

34:53.017 --> 34:55.002
I think
it's closer to...

34:57.005 --> 34:58.018
Yeah, that's it.

35:05.013 --> 35:07.001
Severed the Achilles tendon.

35:07.003 --> 35:09.001
Now, pivot,
knees bent, slice. Go

35:13.023 --> 35:15.006
Good work.

35:17.004 --> 35:19.015
Our killer's between
5'6 and 5'8.

35:19.017 --> 35:23.004
Trained in sword fighting
using a 16-inch
wakizashi blade.

35:23.006 --> 35:24.014
And she's right handed.

35:27.005 --> 35:28.016
I know who the killer is.

35:41.014 --> 35:44.013
So, there's two keypads,
on either side
of the hallway.

35:44.015 --> 35:47.009
Both codes have to be entered
simultaneously.

35:51.010 --> 35:53.020
It's a very intricate
security system.

35:53.022 --> 35:55.016
One requiring two people.

35:55.018 --> 35:59.000
Yeah, I have been thinking.

36:00.013 --> 36:03.011
I think we, uh...
We make sense.

36:03.013 --> 36:05.002
You think we make sense.

36:05.004 --> 36:06.010
Yeah.

36:06.012 --> 36:08.007
That's what every girl
wants to hear.

36:08.009 --> 36:11.012
Tell me that you've run
the numbers
and I'll swoon.

36:15.012 --> 36:17.007
Oh, shit,
you gotta be kidding me.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.017
It's him again.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.008
Fuck Batman.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.010
Don't go home now.

36:23.012 --> 36:25.022
You said "two keypads"?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.018
Yeah.

36:40.008 --> 36:41.006
Three...

36:41.008 --> 36:43.013
Two, one.

36:49.022 --> 36:52.008
-I'll be taking that.

37:34.011 --> 37:35.012
No!

37:44.001 --> 37:45.014
Come on, we need to go.

38:08.021 --> 38:10.019
-Pick up. Pick up.

38:17.022 --> 38:19.005
Dick, take a hint.

38:23.008 --> 38:24.010
Bruce?

38:24.012 --> 38:26.011
<i>Barbara, it's me.</i>

38:27.013 --> 38:28.015
Where are you?

38:28.017 --> 38:30.011
<i>I'll be where it all started.</i>

38:33.012 --> 38:34.022
<i>And, Barbara.</i>

38:35.000 --> 38:36.011
<i>Don't tell Dick.</i>

38:38.007 --> 38:39.018
Oh, shit.

38:46.011 --> 38:48.002
Drop your weapon.

38:48.004 --> 38:51.023
How movin'.
The commissioner
who overcame all the odds.

38:52.001 --> 38:53.012
Drop it.

38:53.014 --> 38:56.012
The Joker
should have put you
out of your misery.

39:08.007 --> 39:09.017
This was worth the wait.

39:39.020 --> 39:41.009
Well...

39:41.011 --> 39:42.023
Best laid plans...

40:01.014 --> 40:02.012
Shit.

40:06.009 --> 40:08.007
Check the Bat-Computer
for homicides.

40:08.009 --> 40:10.018
Wait, you don't think
Blackfire has actually
killed people, do you?

40:10.020 --> 40:11.021
I don't know.

40:13.013 --> 40:15.003
Of course, she does.

40:15.005 --> 40:17.018
Do you have any idea
how long we've been
looking for you?

40:21.008 --> 40:25.011
I was on the wrong side
of tracks,
where you should have been.

40:25.013 --> 40:28.002
I went to some bars,
cracked some skulls

40:28.004 --> 40:30.001
and found out
from the rats of Gotham

40:30.003 --> 40:31.019
that Crane is in bed
with the mob.

40:31.021 --> 40:35.011
But, there is one
unhappy mobster.

40:35.013 --> 40:36.020
That's our lead.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.011
See?

40:39.013 --> 40:41.000
Talk to those
who don't belong

40:41.002 --> 40:43.014
and they'll tell you
everything.

40:43.016 --> 40:45.009
Conner, give us the room.

40:48.009 --> 40:51.020
I can't trust
one word that comes
out of your mouth.

40:54.001 --> 40:56.011
You're a liar.
Have been since
we were kids.

40:56.013 --> 40:58.017
And that's worked
just great for you,
hasn't it?

40:58.019 --> 41:00.010
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

41:00.012 --> 41:03.021
Face it. In order for you
to be the good sister,

41:03.023 --> 41:05.009
I have to be the bad one.

41:06.013 --> 41:08.019
You're not mad that I left.

41:08.021 --> 41:10.009
You're mad I came back.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
-You okay?
-Yeah.

41:19.010 --> 41:21.001
For six years,
Lady Vic
leaves you alone,

41:21.003 --> 41:23.020
and now, all of a sudden,
she wants your pound
of flesh?

41:23.022 --> 41:27.004
This is about
you and I working
together again in Gotham.

41:27.006 --> 41:30.000
Or it's just about
Gotham being Gotham.

41:30.002 --> 41:31.021
Don't have anything
to do with us.

41:31.023 --> 41:34.007
But why now?
I mean, Crane has Red Hood
for his dirty work.

41:34.009 --> 41:37.006
Well, maybe Red Hood's lost
his luster

41:37.008 --> 41:39.007
and she's Crane's new toy.

41:39.009 --> 41:42.016
And while she does his bidding,
she just decides to come
after you for kicks?

41:44.023 --> 41:47.003
We'll see.

41:47.005 --> 41:51.003
Your official escort duties
have concluded, thank you.

41:54.015 --> 41:56.010
She wanted you dead, Barbara.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.009
Just let me quickly
check your apartment.

42:02.001 --> 42:03.003
Okay.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.006
<i>It suits you.</i>

42:27.008 --> 42:28.009
<i>Want it tighter?</i>

42:35.019 --> 42:37.016
<i>I have been thinking
about us.</i>

42:40.001 --> 42:41.018
<i>I think we make sense.</i>

42:59.002 --> 43:00.007
All clear.

43:06.017 --> 43:08.013
Maybe, it was just
a one and done.

43:13.017 --> 43:16.005
I guess that's it.
I think you're good.

43:24.013 --> 43:25.018
You okay?

43:26.014 --> 43:28.007
Yeah, I'm good.

43:30.012 --> 43:32.015
I should probably go.

43:34.003 --> 43:36.006
Right.

43:36.008 --> 43:37.011
It's late.

43:38.017 --> 43:39.017
It is.

43:41.021 --> 43:43.000
Yeah.

43:43.002 --> 43:46.010
Well, then,
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:46.012 --> 43:48.007
Mmm-hmm, good night.

43:49.014 --> 43:50.020
Lock up.

43:51.021 --> 43:53.014
Always.

43:53.016 --> 43:55.014
Good night.

44:09.012 --> 44:11.003
Well, is the bitch dead?

44:11.005 --> 44:13.004
The bitch still has moves.

44:13.006 --> 44:14.021
I had to skedaddle.

44:14.023 --> 44:17.001
Well, as long as
you deliver the goods,

44:17.003 --> 44:19.000
then you will get
a another shot
at Barbara Gordon.

44:19.022 --> 44:21.009
Flash photography.

44:22.018 --> 44:24.021
I'll add another skill
to the resume.

44:26.018 --> 44:27.021
Wonderful.

44:29.012 --> 44:30.012
That's all.

44:32.006 --> 44:36.000
Trust me. This is gonna be
the greatest high
you've ever had.

44:36.020 --> 44:39.012
No fear. No limits.

44:42.015 --> 44:44.002
Fuck you, Crane.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.022
Man, your shifted started
an hour ago,
where the hell are you?

44:51.000 --> 44:53.007
<i>Priorities.
My girls parents
are out of town.</i>

44:53.009 --> 44:54.013
<i>I'll be there in a second.</i>

44:54.015 --> 44:56.016
Seriously?
I could have plans.

44:56.018 --> 44:58.014
<i>Yeah, but you don't.</i>

44:58.016 --> 44:59.017
Whatever.

45:19.019 --> 45:22.009
Hey, hold on.
You okay? You okay?

45:24.015 --> 45:25.020
Call 911.

45:25.022 --> 45:27.001
Stevey?
