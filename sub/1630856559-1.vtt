Oh, well, then I guess I'll just have to
drop your brother off by myself,

you should be embarrassed.

Okay, fine. I'll come. Forget it.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.167
No? Oh, are you sure?

03:43.167 --> 03:46.125
You sure? Because I wouldn't want you
to blush in front of your friends.

[security guard] Unfortunately,
the staff gets a lot of threats

06:59.708 --> 07:01.792
since Mrs. Schiavo got here.

07:01.792 --> 07:04.542
[Mom] So you think while I'm dropping
my son off, I'm going to kill someone?

07:04.542 --> 07:06.333
[Doris] Just let her check your bags.

07:06.333 --> 07:10.292
Hi, there. Is everything okay?
I'm Mia, the Director of Nursing.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.833
- You're the Director? How old are you?
- Mom!

07:12.833 --> 07:14.792
- It's okay.
- What? It's just a question.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.750
How old are you?
'Cause you do. You look young.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.542
[Mia] I actually get that a lot.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.000
Don't worry about your bags.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.083
If you both want to follow me,
I can check you in.

Look at this. Look!

07:46.000 --> 07:47.542
Look at this.

07:48.042 --> 07:51.125
I'm so sorry, honey.
I'm going to clean this place up.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.333
This room is way cleaner than our house.

07:53.958 --> 07:55.208
I don't know if this...

07:57.208 --> 07:58.667
Do you think this is
the right place for him?

07:58.667 --> 08:00.333
I just-- I'm not so sure.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.500
You'd say that about any place.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.875
Are you not at all upset about this?

08:06.417 --> 08:08.500
This is it, Doris.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.125
This filthy box is where
your brother's going to die.

08:11.125 --> 08:12.792
Of course I'm upset.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.833
Can we go soon? I'm already really late.

08:15.833 --> 08:20.583
You know, you could just try and think
about someone other than yourself.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.042
You might like it.

08:22.042 --> 08:23.583
Brad and Jen just broke up.

08:23.583 --> 08:24.833
Right now I'm thinking about them.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.458
Oh, they did?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I knew they would.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.875
The second they got married.
What did I say?

08:32.875 --> 08:34.375
- He's too handsome.
-"He's too handsome."

08:34.792 --> 08:36.542
The handsome ones never stay.

08:39.292 --> 08:40.542
Like your brother.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.667
Too handsome for this world.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.333
Can we go now, please?

08:49.500 --> 08:55.958
[gentle music plays]

08:58.583 --> 09:01.333
Welcome back, Doris. Thank you.

09:05.125 --> 09:08.333
[student 1] Dude, she said it was a
one-time thing, like, I don't know.

09:08.333 --> 09:09.625
Oh, my gosh.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.208
You seriously think
Cody's hooking up with Tiffany?

09:12.208 --> 09:15.208
I know for a fact he did
and good riddance.

09:15.208 --> 09:17.417
Let her keep his dirty dick.

09:17.417 --> 09:18.917
[student 2] He is not
hooking up with Tiffany.

09:18.917 --> 09:21.167
[student 1] Bullshit.
Tiffany told me herself.

09:21.167 --> 09:24.000
She showed me a hickey.
It was shaped like Cody's dirty mouth.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.833
[student 2] Okay, well,
y'all should come over later.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.125
Okay, we're gonna grill by the pool
and Cody will be there,

09:28.125 --> 09:29.625
so you can just ask him yourself.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.375
Okay. Cody's going to be there?

09:31.375 --> 09:35.083
Yes, you best believe my ass will be there
'cause I'm done with these rumors.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.750
[teacher] Okay. Sounds like
most of us are done with the assignment.

09:39.667 --> 09:43.042
So let's talk about being naked in public.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.625
Is that an ethics question?

09:47.708 --> 09:48.708
Yes, Adam.

09:48.708 --> 09:51.292
Well, that depends on
the laws of the land.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.458
[teacher] Exactly.

09:52.458 --> 09:57.167
Banning public nudity is a rule
of a particular society, our society,

09:58.000 --> 09:59.250
especially this classroom.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.375
But what about Christian ethics?

10:02.375 --> 10:04.458
How do they differ
from the law of the land?

10:04.458 --> 10:06.375
[school bell rings]

10:06.917 --> 10:10.500
[teacher] Whoa, what's your hurry?
Am I that boring?

10:13.833 --> 10:15.917
Oh, excuse me.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.417
Yeah, okay.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.583

10:19.583 --> 10:23.292
[Mom] Do you hear it? It's like...
[screeches]

10:24.042 --> 10:26.000
It's got to be driving him insane.

10:27.292 --> 10:30.375
Do not worry, honey.
I'm going to fix this.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.625
[Doris] I doubt he hears it.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.625
Here, get up. I need your chair.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.958
[beep continues]

10:35.958 --> 10:38.792
Of course-- I told that robot
at the front desk,

10:38.792 --> 10:40.292
but of course she didn't do anything.

10:40.292 --> 10:42.625
Mia? You seriously don't like her?

10:42.625 --> 10:44.542
She's, like, the nicest person
I've ever met.

10:44.542 --> 10:49.417
Yeah, well, she's a toddler.
She just goes around smiling.

10:49.417 --> 10:52.208
You shouldn't walk around grinning
if your job is watching people die,

10:52.208 --> 10:55.042
and your brother is stuck here
with this horrible noise.

10:55.042 --> 10:56.375
Here.

10:56.875 --> 10:59.875
Help me up,
I'm gonna stick my head up here.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.042
See what the fuck is going on.

11:02.042 --> 11:03.125
Mom!

11:03.125 --> 11:06.958
For the love of God, Doris,
come over here.

11:06.958 --> 11:09.167
- You're going to fall.
- Well, then you make sure I don't.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.125
[Doris] Can you please just hurry up?

11:12.125 --> 11:13.667
[Mom] Quiet. I can't hear it
when you're talking?

11:13.667 --> 11:17.500
- Everything okay in here?
- No, no, it is not okay in here.

11:17.500 --> 11:21.125
My son is a prisoner here
and he's been tortured by that noise.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.917
- There's barely a noise.
- [screeches]

11:24.917 --> 11:26.417
[Mom] You don't hear that?

11:28.292 --> 11:31.083
Whatever. I'm sorry about her.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.958
She's a lunatic.

Oh, I'm so sorry.

and he's blind and he can't walk,

just doesn't really function anymore.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.292
Fun?

29:10.625 --> 29:15.792
[Doris] No, I didn't mean fun.
I didn't have fun because I was alone.

29:15.792 --> 29:20.667
So... There was a blackout,
and I lit some candles.

29:20.667 --> 29:23.625
And... candles are fun.

29:27.792 --> 29:28.917
You're being weird.

29:29.542 --> 29:31.917
What? No, I'm not.

29:41.583 --> 29:44.167
[Mom] It won't kill you to spend
a few hours with your brother.

29:44.167 --> 29:49.042
But I spent six years with him,
and he has nurses taking care of him now.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.208
Get out of the truck.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.042
Excuse me, ma'am.

29:55.042 --> 29:57.667
I'm sorry, but we need to check
the back of your vehicle.

29:58.708 --> 29:59.875
For what?

30:00.500 --> 30:03.375
[officer] Frankly, we received
a bomb threat yesterday,

30:03.375 --> 30:05.458
and we're taking it pretty seriously.

30:06.125 --> 30:09.958
Everyone in there is about to die anyway.
Who would waste a bomb on that place?

30:09.958 --> 30:12.583
Ignore her. Please, just do
whatever you need to do.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.708
It's unbelievable.

30:20.625 --> 30:23.417
What's in the back there, ma'am?

30:28.542 --> 30:34.000
Well, Officer... that is an oxygen tank.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.375
Because my son's cancer
spread to his lungs.

30:39.958 --> 30:41.208
[Mom] Is that illegal?

30:43.083 --> 30:44.083
Get out.

30:45.917 --> 30:48.167
I'm not staying any way,
I've got to get to work.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.333
At the bomb factory...
where I make hospice bombs.

31:01.875 --> 31:06.292
[gentle music]

31:24.333 --> 31:25.625
Can I have one?

31:27.292 --> 31:28.500
How old are you?

31:29.250 --> 31:31.583
Fine. I'll just go buy some.

31:32.333 --> 31:35.375
You're so full of shit
your eyes are turning brown.

31:35.375 --> 31:38.458
- My eyes are brown.
- Exactly.

31:40.708 --> 31:42.792
You go to Clearwater Christian?

31:44.208 --> 31:45.333
How do you know that?

31:46.583 --> 31:48.792
I know everything about you, Doris.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.958
I'm kidding. It's on your shirt.

31:55.750 --> 31:59.417
- Oh.
- Are you Christian?

32:03.167 --> 32:05.458
No, not exactly.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.500
My mom actually thinks
religion is bullshit.

32:07.500 --> 32:08.792
No offense.

32:08.792 --> 32:11.083
She just didn't want me
going to the public school

32:11.083 --> 32:13.292
after some kid shot a math teacher.

32:13.292 --> 32:15.708
So she has to work all the time
to pay my tuition.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.542
She never shuts up about it.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.000
She's a good mom.

32:20.500 --> 32:23.000
Um... no.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.083
To my brother, maybe, but not to me.

32:27.375 --> 32:30.125
[Paul] You know,
Terri went to Catholic school.

32:30.125 --> 32:31.833
[Doris] How do you know?

32:32.667 --> 32:35.167
- [Paul] Just do.
- [Doris] Do you know her?

32:36.750 --> 32:39.917
- Well, no. I don't know her personally.
- What do you mean?

32:41.250 --> 32:43.167
I don't know her.

32:43.167 --> 32:46.958
But when I found out
that her psychotic husband

32:46.958 --> 32:51.667
was trying to murder her,
I had to come here and do something.

32:51.667 --> 32:56.458
Murder her? But...
You know, she's basically already dead.

32:57.625 --> 32:59.625
She's as alive as you are.

33:01.042 --> 33:03.417
And what if it was you
in there instead of her?

33:06.375 --> 33:10.708
Bottom line is, her husband
didn't want to take care of her anymore.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.667
Honestly, I get that.

33:14.917 --> 33:18.208
It's really hard
taking care of sick people.

33:19.375 --> 33:20.667
Sometimes you need a break.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.792
[Paul] Are you enjoying your break?

33:26.875 --> 33:29.375
I mean, this is going to sound horrible,

33:30.208 --> 33:32.458
but... yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.125
Once your brother's gone, he's gone...

33:40.500 --> 33:44.667
and he is never coming back.
And you will miss taking care of him.

33:44.667 --> 33:47.458
- [Doris] No, I won't.
- [Paul] You will.

33:48.042 --> 33:52.000
[Paul] You'll miss everything.
All the good, all the bad...

33:52.708 --> 33:54.333
Hell, especially the bad.

33:55.333 --> 34:01.000
I'd give anything to hear my wife yell
at me for letting the mosquitoes inside.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.750
Just talk to her, you know?

34:08.625 --> 34:11.583
Well, I haven't talked
to my brother in years.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.667
He's not really aware.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.583
[Paul] Well, you should talk to him.

34:16.583 --> 34:22.500
When they go, suddenly you got
all this important shit to say to 'em.

34:23.125 --> 34:26.208
Or not important shit. You just want to...

34:27.583 --> 34:29.875
Just want to tell 'em stuff.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.083
Hi.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.042
[students chattering]

35:30.042 --> 35:32.708
- [Laci] Look at Nate. Such a dork.
- [Megan] Aw, Nate.

35:32.708 --> 35:36.667
[Brittany] Oh, my God. What is that?
Are you dancing?

35:36.667 --> 35:40.708
Hey, don't hate on my moves. Okay?
I was killin' that.

35:40.708 --> 35:42.792
Oh, Doris, come here.

35:45.542 --> 35:46.583
- [Laci] Hey, girl.
- [Doris] Hey.

35:46.583 --> 35:49.958
- These are from your party.
- That shit was off the chain.

35:49.958 --> 35:54.042
Oh, really? Thanks. I had fun too.

35:54.042 --> 35:57.167
Hey, so my birthday is this weekend.

35:57.167 --> 35:59.375
Could we maybe have
another party at your house?

36:00.583 --> 36:03.583
Well, my mom won't be home, so...

36:03.583 --> 36:06.083
- Yeah, definitely.
- Amazing.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.375
Wait, do you smoke weed?

36:07.375 --> 36:08.625
Oh...

36:09.333 --> 36:15.333
Not right now.
But I'm thinking about starting soon.

36:19.083 --> 36:20.208
Yeah, I do.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.292
[Brittany] Cool.

36:21.292 --> 36:22.833
[Brittany] Oh, my God.

36:22.833 --> 36:24.375
[upbeat music]

36:27.458 --> 36:29.042
Oh, my God.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.458
[Megan] Do we need to, like,
take you to the hospital?

36:33.667 --> 36:36.583
Oh, guess who texted me last night?

36:36.583 --> 36:38.167
Oh, my God. Aaron Miller?

36:38.167 --> 36:40.250
- [Brittany] Correct.
- [Doris] Who?

36:40.250 --> 36:41.833
You don't know Aaron Miller?

36:41.833 --> 36:44.167
- No.
- Do you not, like, live in this town?

36:44.625 --> 36:46.125
[Brittany] He's a few years older than us.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.125
He's so hot.

36:48.125 --> 36:50.250
- Ew.
- Ew.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.500
He is, he is.

36:52.500 --> 36:55.042
We dated for almost a year, but...

36:56.083 --> 36:58.917
he broke it off last month
because he said, I'm, like...

37:00.583 --> 37:01.958
like, immature.

37:02.417 --> 37:05.833
Oh, um... I'm sorry.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.958
I feel like only a really immature person
would be callous enough

37:09.958 --> 37:11.458
to call someone else immature.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.750
Holy shit.

37:15.958 --> 37:17.583
You're so right.

37:18.083 --> 37:22.417
Wow. I've, like, never
thought about it like that.

37:23.250 --> 37:26.792
Yeah, that was, like,
some deep shit, Doris.

37:26.792 --> 37:28.750
Ooh, Deep Doris.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.125
Okay. Well, Deep Doris,
you just earned yourself a keg stand.

37:35.125 --> 37:36.292
What?

37:36.292 --> 37:38.625
- You don't know what a keg stand is?
- No.

37:38.625 --> 37:41.083
Oh, my God, you're like an alien.

37:41.083 --> 37:44.583
[Brittany] Dude, you asked me
if cheese was a vegetable

37:44.583 --> 37:46.625
- and you're calling her an alien?
- No!

37:46.625 --> 37:48.792
No, that was, like, five years ago.

37:48.792 --> 37:51.292
- That was not five years ago.
- Yes, it was.

37:51.292 --> 37:53.125
- More like months.
- It was five...

37:57.000 --> 37:59.042
So, this is going to be so much fun.

37:59.042 --> 38:02.583
Just put your hands right here...
and trust them.

38:03.083 --> 38:04.833
It'll be fun, it'll be fun, it'll be fun.

38:05.292 --> 38:06.333
[Doris] Oh, my God!

38:08.250 --> 38:10.958
[all] One, two, three...

38:39.333 --> 38:40.458
[Brittany] What?

38:44.875 --> 38:46.375
What?

38:46.375 --> 38:51.167
What the fuck is he doing?
Run, you dumbass!

38:52.833 --> 38:55.917
- Okay. Guess what I heard?
- What?

38:55.917 --> 38:57.417
Nate has a crush on Doris.

38:57.417 --> 38:59.375
What? Yeah, right.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.625
- No way.
- Wait. Where'd you hear that?

39:01.625 --> 39:04.000
[Brittany] Aw, that's so hot.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.167
The two of you together,
I would die of horniness.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.667
- But who told you that?
- Do you like him?

39:09.667 --> 39:11.542
I don't know.

39:11.542 --> 39:14.292
Oh, if you do, I can, like,
totally make it happen.

39:14.292 --> 39:19.250
Yeah. I mean, he's not all, like,
deep and quiet or whatever like you are,

39:19.250 --> 39:22.083
but he's a little panty melter, right?

39:22.958 --> 39:25.083
I mean, he's sort of cute.

39:25.583 --> 39:26.917
Oh, my God.

39:26.917 --> 39:28.250
- She loves him.
- She loves him.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.792
You love him.

39:31.125 --> 39:34.292
- You should go to prom with him.
- What? Okay, yeah.

39:34.292 --> 39:36.708
Now that that's out there,
you're going with him.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.667
I'm sorry. You're going. You have to.

39:38.667 --> 39:42.875
Yeah, but don't get her hopes up because
he might not, like, actually be into her.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.625
Ew.

39:45.625 --> 39:48.625
You sound really jealous, and it's boring.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.042
So boring.

39:52.042 --> 39:53.917
[Laci] Can I put some gel in your hair?

39:53.917 --> 39:56.958
Oh, I hate my hair.
I don't know what to do with it.

39:56.958 --> 39:58.875
You should straighten that shit.

39:58.875 --> 40:01.208
I would, like, kill myself
if I had curly hair.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.292
Well, I wish you had curly hair.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.667
Where's your gel? I want to mess with it.

40:06.667 --> 40:09.500
My mom might have some
in the bathroom closet.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.583
Okay.

40:15.417 --> 40:16.625
Oh, no, not in there.

40:17.333 --> 40:18.333
Whoa...

40:20.750 --> 40:23.333
Why do you have, like, a hospital in here?

40:23.333 --> 40:25.042
It's for my brother.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.542
He was sick for a long time, so...

40:27.542 --> 40:29.875
That's, like, heavy shit.

40:31.167 --> 40:33.250
[Laci] Did he, like, die?

40:33.250 --> 40:35.875
[Doris] No. But he is at Suncoast Hospice.

40:35.875 --> 40:38.958
[Brittany] Shut up. With Terri Schiavo?

40:38.958 --> 40:41.708
[Megan] That is so cool.
Wait, like, do you, like, know her?

40:41.708 --> 40:43.583
Wait, can you get us on the news?

40:43.583 --> 40:45.625
[Brittany] Can I have one of these?

40:46.333 --> 40:47.333
[Doris] Sure.

40:48.167 --> 40:49.417
Tight.

40:55.625 --> 40:59.292
- [Megan] Guys, this is so sad.
- [Brittany] I know. You want one?

40:59.292 --> 41:00.375
[Megan] Yeah.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.583
All right. I will see you later.

41:03.583 --> 41:05.292
[Doris] Wait. Can you take me home?

41:07.250 --> 41:10.625
- Why?
- 'Cause I want to go home.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.333
You're home alone too much.

41:16.625 --> 41:20.458
[Mom] He needs visitors. He needs family.

41:20.458 --> 41:23.125
And he shouldn't be alone with Mia.

41:23.667 --> 41:26.333
I honestly-- I think she's a sociopath.

41:27.375 --> 41:31.417
I saw her pushing a dead body
down the hallway, whistling showtunes.

41:33.250 --> 41:36.042
Oh, God, don't pout.

41:36.708 --> 41:40.542
Look, I'll...
I'll take you home after my shift.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.167
You really should spend some time
with him while you can.

41:49.042 --> 41:50.750
All right, sweetheart.

41:50.750 --> 41:55.958
I'm going to work, and I'll be back here
as soon as I can, okay?

42:00.083 --> 42:01.208
All right.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.208
[laughing]

42:06.208 --> 42:07.708
I didn't say that.

42:07.708 --> 42:09.792
[kids clamoring]

42:14.375 --> 42:16.208
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.292
All right, never have I ever...

42:19.583 --> 42:21.333
waxed my pubes.

42:21.333 --> 42:24.083
- You're such a freakin' dick.
- Wow.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.125
[Nate] Don't hate me, hate the game.

42:26.125 --> 42:27.792
[Brittany] The game?

42:32.625 --> 42:33.792
Dare.

42:35.125 --> 42:36.667
I dare...

42:37.917 --> 42:40.042
- all the boys to...
- You can't do that.

42:40.042 --> 42:42.042
- It's got to be one person.
- Kyle, Kyle, shut up.

42:42.042 --> 42:44.042
Okay, it's fine.

42:44.042 --> 42:45.875
Thank you. Thank you.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.250
I dare all the boys to...

42:49.708 --> 42:52.042
to take off their clothes.

42:54.292 --> 42:55.833
I just stood up for her too.

42:55.833 --> 42:57.417
That's crazy, that's crazy.

43:00.833 --> 43:03.000
- Ah.
- Evening, ma'am.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.167
Look who it is. My hero.

43:07.542 --> 43:12.458
Listen, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but no visitors are allowed tonight.

43:13.042 --> 43:16.000
[officer] The judge just set a date
to remove her feeding tube. So we're...

43:16.000 --> 43:19.208
I don't give a shit what he did,
I'm going to go to sleep next to my son.

43:19.208 --> 43:22.833
[officer] I can't let you do that.
No one is allowed in until morning.

43:22.833 --> 43:25.292
Why? What is the problem?

43:25.292 --> 43:27.375
What? You think I'm going to
sneak Schiavo a sandwich?

43:27.375 --> 43:28.792
- I'm going.
- Ma'am? Ma'am?

43:28.792 --> 43:32.333
Ma'am, I will have to place you
under arrest if you do not cooperate.

43:34.583 --> 43:36.292
Are you kidding me?

43:42.333 --> 43:43.875
Look, I...

Look, my son, he is by himself
in that place right now.

he can't speak anymore.

44:05.083 --> 44:07.333

44:08.625 --> 44:10.625

44:12.208 --> 44:15.417
Especially at night. He gets scared.

44:16.583 --> 44:18.583
That boy is honestly...

44:20.000 --> 44:22.625
the first person I ever truly loved.

44:23.667 --> 44:26.667

- Do you know why that is?
- No.

51:41.833 --> 51:44.167
That's because there's more birds
in that in that line.

51:47.542 --> 51:50.792
Silly joke. She started laughing.
And I started laughing.

51:50.792 --> 51:53.375
And then I was laughing more
'cause she was laughing more.

the greatest thing in the world, and...

52:00.375 --> 52:03.625
And then we went to sleep and...

52:07.375 --> 52:10.458
And then, you know, I woke up and...

52:13.500 --> 52:15.167

Okay, now turn-- Left, left. Get around.

59:51.167 --> 59:53.875
Okay, no, but you don't have to go.
Watch out for the barrel!

59:53.875 --> 59:55.250
Watch out for the barrel!

59:55.250 --> 59:57.083
[happy music continues]

59:59.542 --> 01:00:02.750
Look, it's not even an expensive car, but...

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:04.333
- I'm sorry.
- You know, it runs.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:08.333
[Paul] Just try to go straight. You don't
have to go to the right or to the left.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:11.417
Good. Good. Nice and slow. Straight.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.833
Bravo.

01:00:15.833 --> 01:00:17.958
This is good driving.

01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.792
- [Paul] Good. Okay, stop, stop.
- [Doris] Which way?

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:22.333
[Paul] Yeah. Toward us.

01:00:24.625 --> 01:00:29.500
Oh, thank you, God. Thank you for letting
me live through this.

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:54.083
[gentle music]

01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:18.250
[birds chirping]

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:24.583
[Sue] Oh, good morning.

01:01:35.333 --> 01:01:36.542
How are you doing?

01:01:41.125 --> 01:01:42.333
I'm okay.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.417
I just...

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:52.583
I keep thinking about
when I was pregnant with my son.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:56.042
There was this anticipation.

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:58.125
I was waiting because he was...

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.667
arriving at any moment, and I wondered...

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.250
what would he be like?

01:02:05.542 --> 01:02:07.542
What would he bring into my life?

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:11.458
But now I'm waiting for him to leave.

01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:17.625
And I wonder,
what is he going to take from my life?

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:23.625
It's kind of funny.

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:26.375
It must be very hard.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.250
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.958
[Mom] Since we're the only people out
here...

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.250
[Sue] Makes sense.

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:51.333
I've been the mom
of a sick kid for so many years,

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:53.875
I don't know
who I'm gonna be when he's gone.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:57.833
Do you have any other children?

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.417
No.

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:07.333
Oh, my God. Yes. Yes. Christ. Yes.

01:03:08.208 --> 01:03:11.375
Of course. Of course,
I have another child.

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:14.750
I don't know,
I don't know why I just said that.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:16.875
No, I have a daughter.

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:22.333
[Sue] Well, she'll still be here
after he's gone.

01:03:24.292 --> 01:03:29.125
Life will still be here after he's gone.
It's just going to look different.

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:35.750
[teacher] Then in 2003,
they were removed again.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.042
[Nate] We're going out tonight, yes?

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:38.958
One billion percent.

01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:41.583
I just pray my mom goes to sleep
so I can sneak out.

01:03:41.583 --> 01:03:44.000
[Brittany] She will.
You gotta think positive.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.292
[teacher] Brittany. What's your opinion?

01:03:47.042 --> 01:03:49.250
A... bout what?

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:52.458
[teacher] Terri Schiavo, the person
we've been discussing all morning?

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:57.542
Right. Yeah.
Full disclosure, I haven't been listening.

01:03:58.792 --> 01:04:04.750
But I will say I just think
the whole Schiavo thing is just gross.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.250
[teacher] And why is that?

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:08.458
Because people should be allowed to die.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:11.375
Like she told her husband to let her die
if she ever ended up like that.

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:14.417
And all these nosy-ass people
just need to respect her wishes.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.833
[teacher] I didn't ask you,
but thank you, Laci.

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:21.458
I mean, you really should be asking Doris.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:24.042
She, like, basically knows Terri Schiavo.

01:04:24.042 --> 01:04:26.875
[Laci] Yeah, her brother's in hospice
with Schiavo right now.

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:28.167
Who's Doris?

01:04:29.292 --> 01:04:30.292
I am.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:34.958
You don't have to talk about this
if you don't want to, Doris.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.208
No, it's okay.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.583
It's just, it's sort of hard
to talk about it like this.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:43.250
Like, the way we talk
about stuff in this class.

01:04:44.083 --> 01:04:45.292
What do you mean?

01:04:45.292 --> 01:04:47.667
Just, like, I don't know...

01:04:47.667 --> 01:04:50.500
We sit here and we talk
about hypothetical situations

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.375
and what the right or wrong action is,

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:55.583
but you can't really answer
those questions 'cause you don't know.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.333
You don't know what's right or wrong
until it's happening to you.

01:04:58.958 --> 01:05:02.292
Like, we can say Terri's husband is
a monster for wanting to let her die,

01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:04.583
or her parents are monsters
for wanting her to live.

01:05:04.583 --> 01:05:06.875
But we don't know, do we?

01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:08.625
Because we're not them.

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:14.500
I guess you don't know
what's ethical... until you know.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:17.667
[school bell rings]

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:19.167
That was so dope.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.583
[Laci] So smart, Doris.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.833
[Brittany] See you, tonight, baby.

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:41.208
- Doris.
- Hmm?

01:05:43.958 --> 01:05:45.500
I just want to say I...

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I know it's hard
sleeping here every night.

01:05:50.542 --> 01:05:52.542
And I know you're a good kid.

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:56.458
I mean, the whole
party thing was partly my fault,

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:59.083
I shouldn't have left you home alone.

01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:04.917
Okay.

01:06:05.917 --> 01:06:06.958
Thank you.

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:08.417
[phone buzzes]

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.500
Man, I'm so tired.

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:23.583
Night, Mom.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.208
You know...

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.417
if you forget how tragic this place is,

01:06:30.417 --> 01:06:33.792
it's... almost like
we're having a slumber party.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:37.583
Yep.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:41.750
Remember when you were little?

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:49.000
We'd build forts in the living room,
and you'd always yell, "Slumber party!"

01:07:00.958 --> 01:07:03.417
We're going to have fun again, you and me,

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:07.167
when this is over, I'll...

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:10.750
I'll learn how to be fun again.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.583
Mom, you should really get some sleep.
You've been working so hard.

01:07:24.292 --> 01:07:25.708
Okay. Okay.

01:07:26.958 --> 01:07:29.375
Jeez. Goodnight.

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.292
[Laci] I believe in psychics.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.875
- [Brittany] What?
- [Laci] I do.

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:08.208
- [Laci] Oh, my God, she made it out.
- [Brittany] Holy crap.

01:08:08.208 --> 01:08:10.500
[Brittany] I am legit scared of your mom.

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.708
I was like, "That bitch is gonna
run out here and stab us."

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:17.042
[Laci] Here, I brought you an outfit,
but one of the boot heels is broken,

01:08:17.042 --> 01:08:20.250
so just, like, don't dance too hard
or you'll fully face plant.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.417
Got it. Thank you.

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:25.000
[Brittany] Okay, so Nate and Megan
are meeting us there.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.917
- Oh, and Cody.
- Oh, have you met him yet?

01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:29.667
- [Doris] No.
- [Brittany] You're going to hate him.

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:30.833
Well, look, he got me this.

01:08:30.833 --> 01:08:33.500
You know, it's like,
a promise to stop being like,

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.500
a liar and an asshole and stuff.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.792
Well, whatever you want to do,
I support you.

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:39.792
I just want you to be happy.

01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:42.708
You see, Brit?
That is what a real friend looks like.

01:08:42.708 --> 01:08:44.833
Whatever. Easy for you to say, Doris.

01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:48.167
You haven't been dealing
with this shit for four years.

01:08:48.167 --> 01:08:49.250
Four years?

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.542
No, it's not four years,
it's actually three.

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:52.792
'Cause the first year,

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:54.542
- he was not an asshole.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:54.542 --> 01:08:57.750
When I first started dating Cody,
he was such a sweetheart.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.417
I would do anything to go back.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.292
[Brittany] You were just brainwashed.

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:07.125
- I'm so nervous.
- No, girl, we're fine.

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.000
But definitely stop whispering.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:10.708
Hi.

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:15.375
Thank you.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:19.292
Hold.

01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.417
Your ID is gonna expire soon.

01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:31.667
Oh, yeah.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.750
Duh.

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:36.708
I gotta go to the DMV
and get a new one 'cause--

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:38.417
'cause that's where I got that one.

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:42.333
But I mean, you knew that obviously,
'cause you work here, so...

[upbeat club music]

01:09:49.083 --> 01:09:51.458
I thought we were gonna
have to bail you out of jail.

01:09:51.458 --> 01:09:53.333
He definitely knew I was lying.
I almost passed out.

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:55.042
Yeah.

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:58.708
Oh. Hi!

01:10:00.625 --> 01:10:03.208
[Laci] Guys, I have mommy's credit card.
So drinks on me.

01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:06.042
No, no, no, I got Doris.

01:10:06.417 --> 01:10:07.417
[Nate] What can I get you to drink?

01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:09.292
What are you having?

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:10.875
Vodka-cranberry, bitch.

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:12.625
Vodka-cranberry, please.

grinding on his next victim.

[Doris] Oh, my God. That's him?
Well, at least they're just dancing.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.042
[Laci] Are you kidding me?

01:10:30.417 --> 01:10:32.542
Excuse me, ladies.

01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:39.208

Are you freakin' serious?

gross guys here.

I know, right? They're so creepy.

01:10:45.083 --> 01:10:48.083
- Yeah.
- I'm like, ew. Like, stop staring at me.

- [Doris] Thank you.

01:13:03.292 --> 01:13:05.708
And after I tell you
what good kid you are,

01:13:05.708 --> 01:13:08.083
you sneak out, you dress like a hooker?

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:10.292
But you said...

01:13:13.917 --> 01:13:15.458
What is wrong with you?

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:19.292
[Mom] What is wrong with me?
Oh, that-that is great, Doris.

01:13:19.292 --> 01:13:21.417
You break all the rules,
and I'm the bad guy.

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:24.583
You're worse than the bad guy.
You're a fucking monster.

01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:28.750
You don't tell someone that.
You don't lie about that.

01:13:28.750 --> 01:13:30.083
Oh, good. Here come the waterworks.

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:33.250
[Doris] Yes. Okay, I snuck out,
but that doesn't mean you can...

01:13:34.792 --> 01:13:37.125
I've always done
everything you asked me to.

01:13:37.125 --> 01:13:39.792
My entire childhood was wasted
taking care of him

01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:41.542
so that you didn't have to have to.

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:42.917
[Mom] Didn't have to?

01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:50.750
Do you think I liked leaving my sick child
so I could go serve food to tourists?

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:52.125
Huh?

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:56.583
You think I wanted to work
instead of be with my boy?

01:13:56.583 --> 01:14:00.375
I had to work so we could eat,
so we could pay rent.

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:04.250
So you, you can go to your private school
with your perverted friends.

01:14:04.917 --> 01:14:07.292
And go to the slut store!

01:14:12.375 --> 01:14:13.417
I'm done.

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.250
I'm done with this.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:27.375
You can live here with your precious son.

01:14:28.917 --> 01:14:31.042
He's basically dead anyway.

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:41.667

01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:43.167

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:50.333
- Did your brother pass away?
- No.

01:14:51.083 --> 01:14:52.917
She told me he was about to
and she lied to me.

01:14:52.917 --> 01:14:54.458

[Paul] Listen, I know you're not going to
want to hear this right now,

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:06.708
but your mom just did you a huge favor.

01:15:06.708 --> 01:15:10.375
I saw you run in the building.
You're not ready for him to go.

01:15:10.375 --> 01:15:12.833
You need to make your peace with him
while you still have the chance.

01:15:12.833 --> 01:15:13.917

'cause you can't get over your dead wife?

Do I look like your wife or something?
Is that why you're always bothering me?

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:34.125
Well, I'm not her,
so just leave me the fuck alone.
