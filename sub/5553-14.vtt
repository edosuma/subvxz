WEBVTT

00:03.530 --> 00:05.539
Here's a fun Postal fact.

00:05.563 --> 00:07.773
Yeah, the inner side
of our mailbox

00:07.797 --> 00:09.545
is under federal jurisdiction.

00:09.568 --> 00:11.615
So, if you broke
my right thumb,

00:11.639 --> 00:13.396
that's Pasadena city police.

00:13.420 --> 00:15.281
But if you broke
my left thumb,

00:15.305 --> 00:16.863
that's the FBI.

00:18.432 --> 00:20.893
If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him,
not breaking his thumb.

00:20.917 --> 00:22.201
No.

00:22.492 --> 00:24.968
Oh, I got a letter
from my Meemaw.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.669
Umm. Smell this.

00:27.741 --> 00:28.459
What is that?

00:28.551 --> 00:31.189
Uh, roses, bengay,
and Dr. Schools' foot powder.

00:32.137 --> 00:34.409
Yeah, "Grandma",
by Calvin Klein.

00:36.525 --> 00:38.456
Yeah, the last time I got
a hand written letter,

00:38.480 --> 00:41.653
it was from someone who told me
I parked like a blind person.

00:41.677 --> 00:43.224
That someone has a name.

00:43.248 --> 00:44.921
Uh, thank you.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.831
Oh, Meemaw got
a new set of teeth.

00:50.081 --> 00:51.825
Oh, but then
she found her old ones.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.441
Oh, so now the new ones are
just gonna be her church teeth.

00:57.487 --> 00:59.413
Fun. Like your
Comic-Con Spock ears

00:59.437 --> 01:01.336
and your around
the house Spock ears.

01:03.702 --> 01:05.591
***

01:08.482 --> 01:10.282
Oh, my goodness,
she's coming to visit!

01:10.284 --> 01:12.718
Oh, it'll be nice
to finally meet her.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.486
Oh, you are going
to love her.

01:14.488 --> 01:17.289
She is the kindest, sweetest
woman you'll ever meet.

01:17.291 --> 01:20.192
Yeah, unless you're a gopher
digging up her vegetable garden.

01:21.362 --> 01:22.595
In that case, you can expect

01:22.597 --> 01:25.931
to have your head bashed in
with a shovel.

01:55.417 --> 01:57.684
That's not her.
That's not her.

01:57.686 --> 02:00.120
That's not her.
That's not her.

02:00.122 --> 02:02.122
That's not her.

02:02.124 --> 02:04.290
That's not her.
That's not her.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.159
That's not her.
Really?

02:06.161 --> 02:08.360
The old Asian man
is not your Meemaw?

02:10.132 --> 02:12.032
And that's not helpful.

02:13.001 --> 02:14.934
You know, I-I got her
an iPhone for Christmas.

02:14.936 --> 02:16.403
I'll see where she is.

02:16.405 --> 02:17.604
Oh, that's nice.

02:17.606 --> 02:19.606
Most people her age
don't embrace technology.

02:19.608 --> 02:21.341
Oh, no, she doesn't
even know she has it.

02:21.343 --> 02:23.443
No, I had my sister
slip it in her bag

02:23.445 --> 02:27.213
so that I can track her
like a sea turtle.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.649
Same as when we lost you
at the zoo.

02:29.651 --> 02:31.518
Uh, for the hundredth time,

02:31.520 --> 02:33.887
I smelled kettle corn
and couldn't find the cart.

02:35.057 --> 02:36.289
Still doesn't explain

02:36.291 --> 02:39.526
how you ended up
on the freeway divider.

02:39.528 --> 02:41.628
Moon Pie!

02:41.630 --> 02:42.829
Meemaw!

02:42.831 --> 02:44.864
I'm so happy to see you!

02:44.866 --> 02:46.166
I'm happy to
see you, too!

02:46.168 --> 02:47.400
Oh.

02:47.402 --> 02:48.668
You got even smaller.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.203
I love it!

02:50.205 --> 02:52.205
Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard.

02:52.207 --> 02:53.206
Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.474
Hi. So nice
to finally meet you.

02:54.476 --> 02:56.042
Let me take this
for you, Meemaw.

02:56.044 --> 02:57.210
Thank you.

02:57.212 --> 02:59.212
No. Oh, no.
Now you call her “Constance.”

02:59.214 --> 03:00.680
I call her “Meemaw.”

03:00.682 --> 03:01.948
You have your own Meemaw.

03:01.950 --> 03:03.917
It's not my fault
she died when you were four.

03:05.020 --> 03:07.987
Is that nice to say
to your friend?

03:07.989 --> 03:09.889
It isn't, Meemaw.

03:09.891 --> 03:12.058
Sorry, Leonard.

03:13.295 --> 03:15.728
Can you please
live with us forever?

03:15.730 --> 03:18.098
Oh. (laughs)

03:19.267 --> 03:20.867
That's ridiculous!
If you had

03:20.869 --> 03:23.336
a superpower,
and spent your whole life

03:23.338 --> 03:25.038
being told to suppress it,

03:25.040 --> 03:27.474
when you finally decide
to embrace that power,

03:27.476 --> 03:29.709
why hide in isolation?!

03:29.711 --> 03:31.144
I'm sorry,

03:31.146 --> 03:34.781
and how much money did
<i>your</i> version of <i> Frozen</i> make?!

03:35.917 --> 03:37.484
I'm just saying,

03:37.486 --> 03:39.152
instead of “Let it Go,”
she should really sing,

03:39.154 --> 03:41.454
“Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer
Like a Dove Bar.”

03:42.390 --> 03:45.024
She built an ice castle,
made a snow monster

03:45.026 --> 03:48.027
and gave herself
a complete makeover in one day.

03:48.029 --> 03:49.729
You know what I saw
<i>you</i> do today?

03:49.731 --> 03:52.198
Eat a block of cream cheese
straight from the foil

03:52.200 --> 03:54.701
and lie about it to your wife!

03:56.404 --> 03:58.138
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but did you know

03:58.140 --> 04:00.773
they actually had
the song “Let It Go” in place

04:00.775 --> 04:02.408
before they finalized the story?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.844
Yeah, that's true. In fact,
they liked the song so much,

04:04.846 --> 04:06.446
they retooled
the whole script around it.

04:06.448 --> 04:08.381
Which is probably
why that movie sucks.

04:08.383 --> 04:10.617
Here we are
talking about <i> Frozen,</i>

04:10.619 --> 04:12.018
and yet, you got burned.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.154
Miss, I'm so sorry.

04:14.156 --> 04:15.622
How can you not like that movie?

04:15.624 --> 04:17.624
I just think it gets more credit
than it deserves.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.125
Oh, that's what I said
an hour ago.

04:19.127 --> 04:22.896
Wow. You've been talking
about <i> Frozen</i> for an hour?

04:23.932 --> 04:27.300
You should've seen us
after <i> The Good Dinosaur.</i>

04:27.302 --> 04:31.137
It was a classic western
set in the post-Jurassic period,

04:31.139 --> 04:33.806
and it changed my life.

04:37.612 --> 04:39.112
Are you comfortable?

04:39.114 --> 04:40.813
Very.

04:40.815 --> 04:41.748
It's nice to rest

04:41.750 --> 04:44.317
after 800 flights of stairs.

04:46.688 --> 04:49.689
You were so cute,
huffin' and puffin'.

04:49.691 --> 04:50.924
(knocking)

04:50.926 --> 04:52.458
(gasps)
There's Amy.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.127
I just know
you're gonna hit it off.

04:54.129 --> 04:56.863
You both have
the same fashion sense.

04:57.832 --> 05:01.534
Hello! Come in,
say hi to my Meemaw.

05:01.536 --> 05:03.002
Hi. Nice to meet you.

05:03.004 --> 05:04.537
Nice to meet you, too.

05:04.539 --> 05:05.538
How was your trip?

05:05.540 --> 05:06.606
Wonderful.

05:06.608 --> 05:08.341
And the pilot did
such a good job,

05:08.343 --> 05:10.043
I gave him a butterscotch.

05:10.045 --> 05:12.011
(laughs)
That's great.

05:12.013 --> 05:14.447
And look at you,
sitting in Sheldon's spot.

05:14.449 --> 05:16.049
You know, I don't
even get to sit there.

05:16.051 --> 05:17.283
Yeah.

05:17.285 --> 05:18.985
And you never will.

05:18.987 --> 05:21.821
Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the
tissue thing.

05:21.823 --> 05:22.989
Do it, ask her.

05:24.192 --> 05:25.325
Can I have a tissue?

05:25.327 --> 05:26.726
Of course.

05:26.728 --> 05:29.529
(laughs)

05:29.531 --> 05:30.730
Isn't that the best?!

05:30.732 --> 05:32.899
She's like Grandma Spider-Man.

05:33.902 --> 05:35.602
He's been saying that

05:35.604 --> 05:36.903
since he was little.

05:36.905 --> 05:39.405
I still don't know
what it means.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.608
Oh, well, you two sit down
and get to know each other.

05:41.610 --> 05:42.875
I'll get your room ready.

05:42.877 --> 05:44.344
Oh, now don't you go
looking through

05:44.346 --> 05:46.179
my suitcase for presents.

05:46.181 --> 05:47.647
If I did, would I find any?

05:47.649 --> 05:48.881
Maybe.

05:48.883 --> 05:52.719
But you also might find
my brassieres and bloomers.

05:53.755 --> 05:56.623
That's a risk
I'm willing to take!

05:56.625 --> 05:58.157
Well, this is so nice.

05:58.159 --> 06:00.093
He's so excited
to have you here and...

06:00.095 --> 06:03.096
Okay, now let's you and me
get something straight.

06:03.098 --> 06:06.899
He may think that I came
to bake him cookies,

06:06.901 --> 06:09.769
but the real reason
is to size you up.

06:09.771 --> 06:11.971
S-S...

06:11.973 --> 06:13.773
Si-Size me up?

06:13.775 --> 06:16.476
Sheldon's mother may be
okay with you,

06:16.478 --> 06:18.244
but I'm not so easy.

06:18.246 --> 06:19.979
Well, I-I'm...

06:19.981 --> 06:23.182
I'm sure you'll like me
once you get to know me.

06:23.184 --> 06:25.385
Oh, you better hope so.

06:26.788 --> 06:29.389
A Texas Special cattle
and calf car train set

06:29.391 --> 06:30.957
with authentic horn and bell!

06:30.959 --> 06:32.258
Thank you, Meemaw!

06:32.260 --> 06:33.760
Oh, you're welcome, Moon Pie.

06:33.762 --> 06:35.028
Amy, why don't you

06:35.030 --> 06:36.129
look excited?

06:36.131 --> 06:38.231
Well, you get
to watch me play with this!

06:42.070 --> 06:44.370
Oh, I see you're reading <i> Saga.</i>

06:44.372 --> 06:46.439
Yeah, I hear it's pretty good.

06:46.441 --> 06:49.342
It is, and not a lot of comics
have a woman with wings

06:49.344 --> 06:51.878
breastfeeding a baby
right on the cover.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.347
I'll take your word for it.

06:54.349 --> 06:55.348
You should.

06:55.350 --> 06:57.717
He's really looked.

06:58.687 --> 07:01.187
I'm Raj, by the way.

07:01.189 --> 07:02.789
This is Howard.
Hi.

07:02.791 --> 07:04.223
Claire.

07:04.225 --> 07:06.159
Well, I've seen you here before,
Claire.

07:06.161 --> 07:07.660
It's my first time.

07:07.662 --> 07:10.296
I'm looking for inspiration
for this movie I'm writing.

07:10.298 --> 07:11.564
You're a screenwriter?

07:11.566 --> 07:14.801
Well, screenwriter,
slash bartender,

07:14.803 --> 07:18.504
slash, a month away
from living in my car.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.040
Yeah, I get that.

07:21.042 --> 07:22.475
I'm a scientist,

07:22.477 --> 07:23.876
slash party planner,

07:23.878 --> 07:25.878
slash small-dog enthusiast,

07:25.880 --> 07:27.680
slash...

07:27.682 --> 07:30.850
guy who probably should have
stopped at “scientist.”

07:30.852 --> 07:32.752
You're really a scientist?

07:32.754 --> 07:33.853
Well, astrophysicist.

07:33.855 --> 07:35.221
That's perfect.

07:35.223 --> 07:37.890
Do you think I could pick your
brain for my movie some time?

07:37.892 --> 07:39.659
It's animated sci-fi for kids.

07:39.661 --> 07:41.661
Sure. I love animated movies.
He does,

07:41.663 --> 07:44.464
and he has the <i> Lilo & Stitch</i>
collector plates to prove it.

07:46.267 --> 07:49.135
Excuse me for wanting
a little magic in my life.

07:50.472 --> 07:51.771
Here's my number.

07:51.773 --> 07:53.072
Give me a call,
we'll get together.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.941
Yeah, great.
See ya.

07:54.943 --> 07:56.843
Yeah, bye.

07:56.845 --> 07:58.144
What are you doing?

07:58.146 --> 07:59.479
You have a girlfriend.

07:59.481 --> 08:01.147
So?
So,

08:01.149 --> 08:02.515
how do you think she'd feel

08:02.517 --> 08:05.451
about you helping a beautiful
girl with her screenplay?

08:05.453 --> 08:06.953
I wouldn't say
she's beautiful.

08:06.955 --> 08:09.288
Really? You don't think
she's attractive?

08:09.290 --> 08:12.125
I do. I just wouldn't
tell my girlfriend.

08:14.896 --> 08:17.530
Constance, are you sure
I can't pour you some wine?

08:17.532 --> 08:19.499
Oh, no wine for me.

08:19.501 --> 08:23.169
Sheldon's bringing me
my whiskey.

08:23.171 --> 08:25.371
Here you go, Meemaw.
I made it

08:25.373 --> 08:26.472
just how you like--

08:26.474 --> 08:28.541
a lot in a glass.

08:28.543 --> 08:31.310
Thank you, Moon Pie.

08:31.312 --> 08:32.511
Um, curious.

08:32.514 --> 08:34.881
Why do you call Sheldon
“Moon Pie?”

08:34.883 --> 08:36.982
'Cause he's so nummy-nummy.

08:36.985 --> 08:38.885
BOTH:
She could just eat him up.

08:39.654 --> 08:42.054
And I call her “Meemaw”"

08:42.056 --> 08:44.056
because, well, just,
well, look at her.

08:45.393 --> 08:47.326
It's interesting that

08:47.328 --> 08:50.163
Leonard and Penny know
about his nickname

08:50.165 --> 08:51.397
and you don't.

08:51.399 --> 08:53.599
Oh, well, you know,

08:53.601 --> 08:56.035
now-now that I'm hearing it,
it does sound familiar.

08:56.037 --> 08:57.236
How could it?

08:57.238 --> 08:59.572
I never told you,
and you never bothered to ask.

08:59.574 --> 09:01.607
Well, now I know.
Yeah.

09:03.812 --> 09:06.245
So, Penny, I understand
you have a new job.

09:06.247 --> 09:07.313
Yes.

09:07.315 --> 09:08.581
I'm a pharmaceutical
sales rep.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.916
Oh.

09:09.918 --> 09:13.453
It's so wonderful that
you modern gals can have it all.

09:14.355 --> 09:16.722
A husband
and a full-time career.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.892
I have a relationship
and a full-time career, too.

09:19.894 --> 09:22.595
That doesn't bode well.

09:25.233 --> 09:28.334
Why not? You-you just said
it's okay for her to work.

09:28.336 --> 09:32.138
Well, Leonard doesn't need as
much tending to as Sheldon does.

09:32.140 --> 09:33.239
And as Moon Pie explained,

09:33.241 --> 09:35.842
Leonard's work

09:35.844 --> 09:38.211
is more of a hobby.

09:39.681 --> 09:41.581
That's my best friend.

09:41.583 --> 09:42.815
Yeah.

09:42.817 --> 09:44.217
AMY:
Look,

09:44.219 --> 09:46.152
I-I get that you're protective
of your grandson,

09:46.154 --> 09:48.187
but he's an adult now.

09:48.189 --> 09:51.824
Maybe I understand what he needs
better than you do.

09:51.826 --> 09:54.327
I appreciate your honesty, dear.

09:54.329 --> 09:56.229
Thank you.
And here's

09:56.231 --> 09:57.563
some more honesty:

09:57.565 --> 10:00.299
I don't like you very much.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.636
Well, maybe I don't
like you either.

10:03.638 --> 10:04.904
No, no, no, no, no,

10:04.906 --> 10:07.173
no, no, no. Y-You have
to like each other.

10:07.175 --> 10:10.142
Well, we have a 4:30 reservation
at Applebee's.

10:12.347 --> 10:14.347
I think I should leave.

10:14.349 --> 10:15.815
But why?

10:15.817 --> 10:17.416
Other than
you two fighting,

10:17.418 --> 10:20.086
we're having such a good time.

10:20.088 --> 10:22.822
The minute you left the room,
your precious meemaw

10:22.824 --> 10:24.724
started giving me
a really hard time.

10:24.726 --> 10:26.092
I don't need this.

10:26.094 --> 10:27.093
Let her go.

10:27.095 --> 10:29.028
And under no circumstance

10:29.030 --> 10:31.831
will you give her
that engagement ring.

10:33.001 --> 10:33.966
What ring?

10:33.968 --> 10:36.669
Maybe we should give
them some privacy.

10:36.671 --> 10:37.737
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:37.739 --> 10:39.705
You go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

10:41.943 --> 10:44.143
You have
an engagement ring?

10:44.145 --> 10:46.178
Yes.

10:47.015 --> 10:49.482
Penny, did you know
about this?

10:49.484 --> 10:51.350
All right, let's go.

10:53.000 --> 10:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:01.300 --> 11:03.834
When did you get
an engagement ring?

11:03.836 --> 11:05.002
My mother gave it to me,

11:05.004 --> 11:07.071
and I had been thinking
about giving it to you,

11:07.073 --> 11:08.539
but then we broke up.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.140
Well, thank goodness
for that.

11:10.142 --> 11:12.276
Sheldon, will you please tell
your grandmother

11:12.278 --> 11:13.677
to stay out of this?

11:13.679 --> 11:16.080
Oh, I don't think
I could do that.

11:16.082 --> 11:17.815
Sheldon, tell this girl

11:17.817 --> 11:20.751
that my ring will never be
on her finger.

11:20.753 --> 11:22.119
(sighs) Y...

11:22.121 --> 11:25.322
I'm gonna opt out
of that one, too.

11:25.324 --> 11:27.925
Who said I even want
to be engaged to him?

11:27.927 --> 11:29.793
And if I do, I-I don't need
your hand-me-downs!

11:29.795 --> 11:30.794
All right, all right!

11:30.796 --> 11:31.996
Look, l-let's all...

11:31.998 --> 11:33.364
let's remain calm

11:33.366 --> 11:34.665
and analyze this situation.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.867
Now, I realize that
you've only known each other

11:36.869 --> 11:38.035
for less than a day,

11:38.037 --> 11:40.838
but is it possible this
crankiness is because

11:40.840 --> 11:42.673
your cycles have synced?

11:42.675 --> 11:44.575
You leave the room

11:44.577 --> 11:46.443
and let the grown-ups talk.

11:46.445 --> 11:47.611
Now.

11:47.613 --> 11:50.547
Don't speak to him
like he's a child.

11:50.549 --> 11:54.018
Thank you. I'm gonna go next
door and play with Leonard.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.657
Okay, so you met this girl,
you exchanged numbers,

11:59.659 --> 12:01.091
and you're gonna
meet up with her.

12:01.093 --> 12:02.726
Just to help her
with her screenplay.

12:02.728 --> 12:04.628
Oh. Well,
I guess that's not so bad.

12:04.630 --> 12:05.663
You weren't there.

12:05.665 --> 12:06.897
He was really flirting.

12:06.899 --> 12:09.833
Hey, it's not my fault
if American women project

12:09.835 --> 12:11.235
their fantasies on foreigners

12:11.237 --> 12:15.039
with the kind of magical voice
that grants wishes.

12:15.041 --> 12:17.174
I'm sure it was harmless.

12:17.176 --> 12:18.542
People flirt. No big deal.

12:18.544 --> 12:20.511
Really? So it's
okay if I fl...

12:20.513 --> 12:22.680
Not you. I own your ass.

12:23.950 --> 12:26.884
The real question is,
where are you with Emily?

12:26.886 --> 12:28.752
Uh, it's hard to say.

12:28.754 --> 12:30.788
I think we're good,
but things like this

12:30.790 --> 12:33.257
make me wonder if Emily's
really the right person for me.

12:33.259 --> 12:35.326
I mean, did you guys ever have
doubts about each other?

12:35.328 --> 12:37.661
No. Never.
Absolutely.

12:37.663 --> 12:38.796
What?

12:38.798 --> 12:39.997
Howie, you forget

12:39.999 --> 12:41.332
how much of our early dates

12:41.334 --> 12:42.466
involved you doing magic

12:42.468 --> 12:44.168
and me doing this.

12:45.905 --> 12:47.471
Fine.

12:47.473 --> 12:49.606
I had reservations
about you, too.

12:49.608 --> 12:50.407
No, you didn't.

12:50.409 --> 12:52.009
No, I didn't.

12:52.011 --> 12:53.911
Well, it doesn't matter now,

12:53.913 --> 12:55.913
'cause I love
how things worked out.

12:55.915 --> 12:57.047
Me, too.

12:57.049 --> 12:58.949
And I think you're
even more beautiful

12:58.951 --> 13:01.151
than this rose.

13:06.425 --> 13:09.393
Wow. The last time
I saw my grandma,

13:09.395 --> 13:10.828
the most exciting thing
was watching the ash

13:10.830 --> 13:12.596
of her cigarette get longer
and wondering

13:12.598 --> 13:15.299
if it was gonna fall
in her pudding.

13:15.301 --> 13:17.034
Did it?

13:17.036 --> 13:18.035
Yeah, right in there.

13:18.037 --> 13:19.770
She ate it and everything.

13:19.772 --> 13:22.006
(knocking)
SHELDON: Leonard and Penny.

13:22.008 --> 13:23.741
Leonard and Penny.
Leonard and Penny.

13:23.743 --> 13:25.109
Come in!

13:25.111 --> 13:26.410
LEONARD:
Hey. What happened?

13:26.412 --> 13:27.611
Is Amy gone?

13:27.613 --> 13:29.346
No. They asked me to leave

13:29.348 --> 13:31.081
so they could speak privately.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.983
Uh-oh.
Yeah, I know. It was quite tense.

13:32.985 --> 13:35.652
So here's
the million dollar question:

13:35.654 --> 13:39.390
uh, who wants to pop over there
and get my trains?

13:42.194 --> 13:44.194
All right.
I've made up my mind.

13:44.196 --> 13:46.030
I'm gonna do the right thing,
call this girl,

13:46.032 --> 13:47.865
and let her know
that I'm in a relationship.

13:47.867 --> 13:48.999
Okay, so far we've heard,

13:49.001 --> 13:50.901
“made up my mind,
I'm dumping Emily.”

13:50.903 --> 13:52.636
“Made up my mind
to date both of them

13:52.638 --> 13:55.572
by pretending
to be twin brothers.”

13:56.442 --> 13:57.441
And “made up my mind,

13:57.443 --> 13:58.609
“I'll ask for a threesome

13:58.611 --> 14:01.311
and if they say no,
play it off as a joke.”

14:01.313 --> 14:02.679
I'm calling her.

14:02.681 --> 14:05.916
And the threesome didn't deserve
the belly laugh it got.

14:05.918 --> 14:07.551
You're right.

14:07.553 --> 14:11.021
(stifled laughter):
It could totally happen.

14:11.023 --> 14:12.089
CLAIRE:
Hello?

14:12.091 --> 14:13.657
Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj.

14:13.659 --> 14:15.592
Rajesh.
We met at the comic book store.

14:15.594 --> 14:17.928
Hey, what's up? Figure out
what time you're free?

14:17.930 --> 14:19.296
Actually,
that's why I'm calling.

14:19.298 --> 14:20.664
I, um... I just...

14:20.666 --> 14:23.333
I need to let you know
that I have a girlfriend.

14:23.335 --> 14:25.269
Okay. Good for you.

14:26.072 --> 14:27.104
Well, no, no.

14:27.106 --> 14:28.272
I-I didn't want to mislead you

14:28.274 --> 14:29.573
after you asked me out.

14:29.575 --> 14:31.208
I didn't ask you out.

14:31.210 --> 14:33.077
I just need help
with my screenplay.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.612
Wait, are you saying
that we didn't have a vibe?

14:35.614 --> 14:37.781
Why do you care if we have
a vibe? You have a girlfriend.

14:37.783 --> 14:39.783
Come on! I just told you
I had a girlfriend.

14:39.785 --> 14:41.705
The least you can do is tell me
if we had a vibe.

14:43.322 --> 14:44.688
Sure, we had a vibe.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.490
I knew it.
Okay, we did have a vibe.

14:46.492 --> 14:47.791
This is exciting.

14:47.793 --> 14:49.960
What's my next move?

14:49.962 --> 14:51.328
You still have a girlfriend.

14:51.330 --> 14:53.497
Right. Good catch.

14:54.467 --> 14:56.133
Anyway, so I'm sorry
to waste your time.

14:56.135 --> 14:57.768
And, uh... and good luck
with your screenplay.

14:57.770 --> 14:59.103
Hang on.

14:59.105 --> 15:00.504
We're both adults.

15:00.506 --> 15:02.706
We can still get together
without it meaning anything.

15:02.708 --> 15:05.075
Not me. Ever since
you admitted we had a vibe,

15:05.077 --> 15:07.010
I've been planning our wedding.

15:08.414 --> 15:11.115
Look, it's just coffee.

15:11.117 --> 15:12.716
I'll ask you some questions
about science,

15:12.718 --> 15:15.552
and if you propose,
I promise to say no.

15:15.554 --> 15:18.789
Okay. That hurts a little,
but okay.

15:19.492 --> 15:21.024
Great. I'll text you.

15:21.026 --> 15:22.626
Bye.

15:22.628 --> 15:23.927
All right.

15:23.929 --> 15:26.864
So, uh, we're meeting
for coffee like two adults.

15:26.866 --> 15:28.765
Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.

15:28.767 --> 15:30.400
Are you gonna tell Emily?

15:30.402 --> 15:31.535
Yeah, of course.

15:31.537 --> 15:33.003
We have no secrets.

15:33.806 --> 15:35.539
When are you gonna tell Emily?

15:36.408 --> 15:38.609
He lied about the cream cheese!

15:38.611 --> 15:40.677
He ate the whole thing!
I saw him!

15:43.516 --> 15:46.016
Look, I know you think
I'm not right for Sheldon,

15:46.018 --> 15:48.018
but trust me,
I'm his best shot.

15:48.020 --> 15:50.521
You have no idea
how much I put up with!

15:50.523 --> 15:52.789
I know more than you think I do.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.925
Really? You know what it's like
to have date night ruined

15:54.927 --> 15:57.661
because Google changed
their font?

15:57.663 --> 15:59.663
Young lady,

15:59.665 --> 16:01.331
if you think I don't know

16:01.333 --> 16:02.566
what it's like to live

16:02.568 --> 16:04.668
with a stubborn,
egotistical man,

16:04.670 --> 16:06.003
then you're wrong.

16:06.005 --> 16:08.038
'Cause that was my husband.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.773
Really?

16:09.775 --> 16:11.008
(sighs)

16:11.010 --> 16:13.744
There were days I wanted to fill
his pockets with corn

16:13.746 --> 16:16.280
and toss him in the pigpen.

16:17.116 --> 16:19.349
Well, if you understand,

16:19.351 --> 16:22.019
then why are you giving me
such a hard time?

16:22.021 --> 16:24.121
Because when you broke up
with Sheldon,

16:24.123 --> 16:25.422
it hurt him deeply,

16:25.424 --> 16:27.858
and I don't want to see
that happen again.

16:27.860 --> 16:29.059
(door opens)

16:29.061 --> 16:31.028
Hi. Sorry.

16:31.030 --> 16:33.263
Sheldon would like
to say something to you.

16:33.265 --> 16:34.331
SHELDON:
No, I wouldn't.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.632
Just get in here.

16:37.036 --> 16:38.068
Hello.

16:38.070 --> 16:39.536
Go ahead.

16:39.538 --> 16:41.104
Meemaw, look,

16:41.106 --> 16:43.073
I'm sorry, but...

16:43.075 --> 16:44.374
I have to defend

16:44.376 --> 16:46.310
my girlfriend to you.

16:46.312 --> 16:48.612
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

16:48.614 --> 16:51.215
Oh, great, now you're gonna
get emotional.

16:55.854 --> 16:59.456
I always looked up
to you and Pop-Pop.

16:59.458 --> 17:01.725
I-I know what
a challenging man he could be,

17:01.727 --> 17:05.061
but I saw you stand
by him and-and make him

17:05.064 --> 17:06.663
into a better person.

17:06.665 --> 17:07.698
I did.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.799
Yeah, well, that is exactly

17:08.800 --> 17:10.767
what I've been doing
the last five years

17:10.769 --> 17:13.002
with this little
work in progress.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.974
He never disappoints,
does he?

17:19.144 --> 17:22.179
I think what Sheldon means
to say is

17:22.181 --> 17:24.381
we've both grown together.

17:24.383 --> 17:25.449
Isn't that right?

17:25.451 --> 17:26.849
Well...

17:26.852 --> 17:27.317
Say yes.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.685
Yes.

17:28.687 --> 17:30.087
MEEMAW:
Fine.

17:30.089 --> 17:33.790
If you feel so strongly,
I won't stand in your way.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.025
Thank you.

17:35.027 --> 17:36.126
So if he wanted

17:36.128 --> 17:38.328
to give me
that engagement ring,

17:38.330 --> 17:40.364
we would have your blessing?

17:40.366 --> 17:42.366
I suppose.

17:47.673 --> 17:49.239
I just gave you
my virginity, woman.

17:49.241 --> 17:50.974
Cool your jets.

18:01.690 --> 18:04.591
Yeah, see, if you
just change the story

18:04.593 --> 18:06.727
to the destruction
of our <i> galaxy,</i>

18:06.729 --> 18:09.229
then a super massive
black hole could work.

18:09.231 --> 18:10.797
This is great.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.066
Thank you so much.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.968
I just got to figure out
a way for everyone

18:14.970 --> 18:17.638
to die that isn't too scary
for children.

18:19.275 --> 18:23.076
And that's how
Mommy and Daddy met.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.847
Hey, did you ever tell Emily
about us?

18:26.849 --> 18:28.315
I will!
