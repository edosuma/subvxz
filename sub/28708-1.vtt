<i>Carl Sagan once said
that human beings</i>

00:43.934 --> 00:46.468
<i>are like butterflies

00:46.470 --> 00:48.239
<i>and think it's forever.</i>

00:52.309 --> 00:54.710
<i>13.8 billion years ago,</i>

00:54.712 --> 00:56.679
<i>the Big Bang

01:10.828 --> 01:14.732
<i>The Big Bang also led
to my home.</i>

01:18.069 --> 01:19.605

01:42.194 --> 01:44.229
<i>The path we choose.</i>

01:48.399 --> 01:51.534
<i>I always believed
it would take a lifetime</i>

01:51.536 --> 01:54.573
<i>to understand the human heart.</i>

01:55.673 --> 01:59.507
<i>In the end, all it took</i>

01:59.509 --> 02:01.679
<i>was a single day.</i>

02:24.101 --> 02:25.668
Dad?

02:25.670 --> 02:27.235
I gotta run.

02:27.237 --> 02:28.538
Accept destiny.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.605
Okay, um,
I have my appointment

02:30.607 --> 02:32.609
at the immigration office
at 8:00.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.145
Don't put yourself
through that, baby girl.

02:35.147 --> 02:36.246
Give it up.

02:36.248 --> 02:37.849
We've been through lawyers.

02:38.315 --> 02:39.981
'Tasha.

02:39.983 --> 02:42.618
We've tried for
too long, Natasha Kingsley.

We leave tomorrow.

02:44.255 --> 02:45.587
We're going home.

02:45.589 --> 02:47.789
But this... This is my home.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.660
New York is my home.

02:50.562 --> 02:51.762

03:59.196 --> 04:01.697
I... I set up
the InfoPass appointment

04:01.699 --> 04:03.064
in order to retry
my parents' case.

04:03.066 --> 04:05.435
Everything's in this file.

04:05.437 --> 04:08.805
Do yourself a favor,
let me read it.

04:08.807 --> 04:10.107
Okay.

04:14.411 --> 04:16.047
Okay, here we go.

04:17.581 --> 04:18.949
Father's name?

04:19.550 --> 04:21.017
Samuel.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.786
Your brother?

04:23.788 --> 04:25.588
Peter.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.956
- Younger?
- Peter's 11.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.559
Was he born in the U.S.?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.060
No. He was born in Jamaica.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.362
- We moved when he was four.
- Any family members

04:32.364 --> 04:34.463
that are U.S. citizens?

04:34.465 --> 04:37.699
No. I've looked.

04:37.701 --> 04:39.836
When are you all set to leave?

04:39.838 --> 04:41.437
Tomorrow.

04:41.439 --> 04:42.740
Tomorrow?

04:43.208 --> 04:44.574
Tomorrow.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.777
Okay.

04:55.987 --> 05:00.689
Your case is no longer
under USCIS jurisdiction.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.458
What does that mean?

05:02.460 --> 05:04.196
Your removal is final.

05:05.129 --> 05:06.397
Sorry.

05:11.970 --> 05:15.204
So, there's nothing
you can do?

05:15.206 --> 05:17.072
You know,
I've been to Jamaica.

05:17.074 --> 05:19.475
It's a beautiful place.

05:19.477 --> 05:21.877
Everything there is <i>irie.</i>

05:21.879 --> 05:24.116
You know,
you're gonna be okay.

05:24.883 --> 05:27.249
Yeah. Forget it.

05:27.251 --> 05:28.783
Hey, hey, hey.

05:28.785 --> 05:30.987
You're going to Jamaica.

05:30.989 --> 05:32.555
Some people are going
to Gaza in here.

05:32.557 --> 05:36.023
Some people are going
to Syria, Afghanistan.

05:36.025 --> 05:38.929
You're gonna be okay.

05:44.569 --> 05:47.802
Everybody tells me
that I'm gonna be okay

05:47.804 --> 05:50.139
and I'm tired of it.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.608
'Cause I've been here
for nine years.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.843
I'm supposed to be
going into senior year,

05:54.845 --> 05:56.678
focusing on AP Chem,

05:56.680 --> 05:58.180
and college and all of that.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.083
But instead I am here.

06:00.085 --> 06:02.351
And this is the last place
I wanted to be.

06:02.353 --> 06:05.021
This is the last place,
'cause this is my home.

06:05.023 --> 06:09.425
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm sorry, all right?

06:09.427 --> 06:10.962
Maybe there's something.

06:19.703 --> 06:21.069
Take this.

06:21.071 --> 06:23.673
That's a friend of mine,
does some pro bono work.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.110
Jeremy Martinez.
He's a lawyer.

06:27.412 --> 06:28.914
Call him.

06:34.117 --> 06:35.317
Hi, I'd like
to set an appointment

06:35.319 --> 06:37.052
with Mr. Martinez
today, please.

06:37.054 --> 06:38.420
My name is Natasha Kingsley.

06:38.422 --> 06:39.590
<i>What is this regarding?</i>

06:41.893 --> 06:43.658
My family is being
deported tomorrow

06:43.660 --> 06:45.394
and we need his help.

06:45.396 --> 06:47.795
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Martinez

06:50.968 --> 06:53.369

06:53.371 --> 06:56.238
Can you please help me out?
Can you? Please.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.939
Just this one time.
I'm begging you.

06:57.941 --> 06:59.242
<i>Please.</i>

06:59.244 --> 07:00.576
<i>All my parents
ever dreamed about</i>

07:00.578 --> 07:02.080
<i>was to bring us here.</i>

07:05.016 --> 07:07.182
Listen, I can give you
15 minutes at noon,

07:07.184 --> 07:08.716
which is his lunch.

07:08.718 --> 07:10.018
<i>But that is it.</i>

07:10.020 --> 07:11.821
Okay, that's all I need.
Thank you.

07:11.823 --> 07:14.092
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

Very good.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.804
- Good morning.
- Mmm.

10:17.775 --> 10:19.041
What?
I don't understand

10:19.043 --> 10:20.245

10:23.079 --> 10:24.379
Hmm.

10:24.381 --> 10:26.881

10:31.421 --> 10:33.054
It's all on you now,
Danny boy.

10:46.337 --> 10:48.673

11:02.118 --> 11:03.786
Then, straight to school.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.220
- No friends.
- I won't.

11:05.222 --> 11:07.092
Do not be late.

12:04.681 --> 12:06.248
Yo, I can't tell
if I'm riffing too much

12:06.250 --> 12:07.381
in this song or not.

12:07.383 --> 12:08.649
The line, it's, uh...

12:08.651 --> 12:10.985

going to Dartmouth.

12:33.776 --> 12:36.344
I'm not in yet.
Depends on today.

Yeah, you got this, dude.

12:38.681 --> 12:39.950

12:53.863 --> 12:56.063
MTA crushing it as always.

<i>We got a train
delay at 68th Street.</i>

12:58.935 --> 13:01.302

13:04.775 --> 13:05.841
<i>Let me just</i>

13:05.843 --> 13:07.809
<i>say a little something
for you.</i>

13:07.811 --> 13:10.245
<i>So, I take my daughter
to school every morning.</i>

13:10.247 --> 13:11.647
<i>Me and my friend, Levi,</i>

13:11.649 --> 13:13.447
<i>we got overly
in a conversation...</i>

13:13.449 --> 13:14.982
We're taking the bus
next time.

13:14.984 --> 13:16.817
<i>...which almost made our kids
late for school.</i>

13:16.819 --> 13:18.653
<i>We get down to the subway
and we miss the train.</i>

13:18.655 --> 13:20.423
Shut up, asshole.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.591
<i>And that
particular morning,</i>

13:22.593 --> 13:24.996
<i>it just happened to be 9/11.</i>

13:26.030 --> 13:27.897
<i>Had Levi made that train,</i>

13:27.899 --> 13:30.097
<i>he would have been the one
that goes into Manhattan</i>

13:30.099 --> 13:32.603
<i>because he worked
at the World Trade Center.</i>

13:33.703 --> 13:35.169
<i>What I'm trying to say is,</i>

13:35.171 --> 13:38.639
<i>don't panic because
of you being late.</i>

13:38.641 --> 13:40.142
<i>You never know why</i>

13:40.144 --> 13:41.946
<i>you were meant to be here
at this time.</i>

13:43.948 --> 13:46.048
<i>Grand Central Station,
next stop,</i>

13:46.050 --> 13:48.048
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

13:48.050 --> 13:52.890
<i>Always remember to open up
your heart to destiny.</i>

13:59.195 --> 14:00.731
That was quite a story.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.764
Made me think,

14:02.766 --> 14:04.899
"Wow, he needs a therapist."

14:04.901 --> 14:06.302
Yo, I got some time
before work.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.872
So, windows, yeah?

14:37.934 --> 14:40.735
His legs are the same size
as the rest of his body.

14:40.737 --> 14:42.037
Shit.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.706
Well, there's your future.
Right there.

14:45.708 --> 14:47.442
What, that guy
dancing right there?

14:47.444 --> 14:48.744
No, you can't dance that well.

14:48.746 --> 14:51.113
Guy that's right there
in the middle.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.116
He looks like everything
was going well in his life

14:55.118 --> 14:57.251
and now, nope. Nothing.

14:57.253 --> 14:58.989
That's too bad. Poor guy.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.857
There's your role model.

15:02.859 --> 15:05.362
- The monk?
- Yeah, the monk.

15:06.897 --> 15:09.466
He looks happier
than everyone else.

15:10.767 --> 15:11.899
Yeah.

15:11.901 --> 15:13.168
I think we're missing
something.

15:13.170 --> 15:14.572
Something's going on.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.042
Whoa.

16:30.314 --> 16:31.779
What?

16:31.781 --> 16:32.949
Her.

16:37.820 --> 16:39.956
It's just a cute girl, Daniel.

16:41.592 --> 16:44.562
I mean, okay.
She's really cute, but...

16:45.694 --> 16:47.296
No one ever does that.

16:47.298 --> 16:48.429
What?

16:48.431 --> 16:50.298
Look up.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.466
Everyone is so busy
looking straight ahead,

16:52.468 --> 16:54.838
they don't bother to look up.

17:03.547 --> 17:04.846
- Holy shit!
- What?

17:04.848 --> 17:07.182
- Wait, where you going?
- Her jacket.

17:07.184 --> 17:08.848
- <i>Deus ex machina.</i>
- So?

17:08.851 --> 17:10.184
I wrote it this morning.

17:10.185 --> 17:12.554
It's Latin for
"God from the machine."

17:12.556 --> 17:13.622
I don't know what that means.

17:13.624 --> 17:15.124
Open up your heart.

17:15.126 --> 17:16.826
What? Sorry,
what are you talking about?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.759
Daniel, where are you going?
Daniel!

17:18.761 --> 17:21.496
Open up your heart
to destiny.

17:31.075 --> 17:32.610
Excuse me.

17:55.331 --> 17:56.965
I can't find her.

17:56.967 --> 17:59.233
Yeah, I don't see her.
Wasn't meant to be.

17:59.235 --> 18:01.071
But, hey, man, you tried.

18:03.639 --> 18:04.838
I think I'm gonna
see her again.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.141
I don't think so, man.

18:06.143 --> 18:07.776
I'll text you
after my shift, okay?

18:07.778 --> 18:09.076
All right. Wish me luck.

18:09.078 --> 18:10.615
With the interview
or the girl?

18:11.147 --> 18:12.448
Daniel.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.184
Text me when you come back
to planet Earth, okay?

18:45.148 --> 18:48.685
<i>The next stop
is East Broadway.</i>

19:36.666 --> 19:38.400
Excuse me.

19:42.473 --> 19:44.772
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:21.805 --> 21:23.441
Hey, he's okay.

21:25.009 --> 21:26.207
Here, take my water.

21:26.209 --> 21:27.942
I'm so sorry.
You okay?

21:27.944 --> 21:30.510
Yeah. Yeah.

21:30.512 --> 21:32.183
That was close.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.192
Can I help you up?

21:43.126 --> 21:44.358
Thanks.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.762
Ow!

21:50.032 --> 21:52.402
Sorry about pulling you down.

21:53.869 --> 21:56.005
Can I ask your name?

21:56.705 --> 21:58.574
Natasha.

21:58.576 --> 22:00.144
I'm Daniel.

22:01.311 --> 22:03.778
You saved my life.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.281
Thank you.

22:09.586 --> 22:11.521
Do you want to sit down?

22:36.746 --> 22:38.212
I normally don't wear a suit.

22:38.214 --> 22:41.452
It's for my alumni interview
for Dartmouth.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.618
No school today?

22:44.620 --> 22:46.887
Uh, no. No school.

22:46.889 --> 22:48.892
What's with the notebook?

22:50.694 --> 22:51.926
Uh...

22:51.928 --> 22:53.296
Just poems.

22:54.431 --> 22:55.497
Poems?

22:55.499 --> 22:57.932
Yeah, I just dabble
in it for fun.

22:57.934 --> 22:59.867
Not a big deal, really.

22:59.869 --> 23:01.202
What are they about?

23:01.204 --> 23:03.404
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, let me guess.

23:03.406 --> 23:05.106
Love.

23:05.108 --> 23:07.811
- Not all of them.
- But most of them?

23:09.578 --> 23:10.644
Yes.

23:10.646 --> 23:12.413
Well, I don't believe in love.

23:12.415 --> 23:14.715
It exists whether you
believe in it or not.

23:14.717 --> 23:16.218
And that's a provable fact?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.353
Yeah. How could thousands
of songs and poems

23:18.355 --> 23:20.087
be about something
that doesn't exist?

23:20.089 --> 23:22.524
Boy, please!
Words on paper.

23:22.526 --> 23:23.892
What would convince you?

23:23.894 --> 23:25.460
If you can't use the
scientific method on it,

23:25.462 --> 23:26.994
then it's not real.

23:26.996 --> 23:28.696
Anything in this world
that's a fact,

23:28.698 --> 23:31.098
it's a fact because we can
either observe it,

23:31.100 --> 23:33.234
measure it,
or experiment with it.

23:33.236 --> 23:34.434
If you can't do
any of those things,

23:34.436 --> 23:37.505
then it's legit,
deadass not real.

23:37.507 --> 23:40.008
But you gotta admit
people are feeling something.

23:40.010 --> 23:42.609
Hormones.
They're feeling hormones.

23:42.611 --> 23:43.912
And we just call it love,

23:43.914 --> 23:46.480
so that we have something
grand to live for.

23:46.482 --> 23:48.516
Otherwise, life seems
really mundane

23:48.518 --> 23:51.118
and just a random
series of events

23:51.120 --> 23:54.591
that you have no control over
until you die.

23:57.994 --> 23:59.861
Depressing, right?

23:59.863 --> 24:02.029
You make it sound depressing.

24:02.031 --> 24:03.567
Because it is.

24:04.868 --> 24:09.205
So, no magic, no fate,
no "meant to be"?

24:10.205 --> 24:11.606
What if I told you
I could get you,

24:11.608 --> 24:16.076
to fall in love with me?
Scientifically.

24:16.078 --> 24:18.212
How is that humanly possible?

24:18.214 --> 24:19.980
Just give me a day.

24:19.982 --> 24:21.682
One day.

24:21.684 --> 24:22.919
Today.

24:24.655 --> 24:27.888
I can't. I don't have a day.

24:27.890 --> 24:29.459
Do you have an hour?

24:39.836 --> 24:41.105
An hour.

24:43.138 --> 24:46.007
I'm not changing
my mind, though.

24:46.009 --> 24:48.542
<i>♪ Life is good, who's askin'? ♪</i>

No. My appointment's at noon

25:19.474 --> 25:21.142
and I'll be home
right after that.

25:21.144 --> 25:22.710
<i>Your mother is worried sick.</i>

25:22.712 --> 25:24.178
<i>You have to come
pack your stuff.</i>

25:24.180 --> 25:26.181
Dad, this lawyer might
be able to help.

25:26.183 --> 25:28.782
Stop being
such a stubborn child.

25:28.784 --> 25:30.218
And get home now.

25:30.220 --> 25:32.119
Please, we have
to do something.

25:32.121 --> 25:34.888
This is honestly
our last chance.

25:34.890 --> 25:36.358
Come pack your stuff.

25:37.424 --> 25:38.259
I'm gonna throw it
all in the trash.

25:38.261 --> 25:41.397
Will you please just listen
to me for once?

26:04.187 --> 26:06.153
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Daniel Bae?</i>

26:06.155 --> 26:07.721
Yes, this is Daniel Bae.

26:07.723 --> 26:09.057
<i>My apologies, but Mr. Martinez</i>

26:09.059 --> 26:10.424
<i>needs to reschedule
our interview.</i>

26:10.426 --> 26:12.193
- Reschedule?
- <i>Tomorrow morning, 8:00.</i>

26:12.195 --> 26:14.695
Yeah! I think
I can make that work.

26:14.697 --> 26:16.029
<i>Okay. Wonderful.
Thank you so much.</i>

26:16.031 --> 26:17.266
Uh-huh. See you then.

26:21.338 --> 26:23.003
Yes!

26:30.079 --> 26:31.878
Hey.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.513
What was that all about?

26:33.515 --> 26:36.219
- Just parents being parents.
- Hmm.

26:39.088 --> 26:40.323
Loosened your tie.

26:40.857 --> 26:42.190
Yeah.

26:42.192 --> 26:44.661
Uh, my interview
got postponed to tomorrow.

26:45.561 --> 26:48.464
But back to love and science.

26:49.132 --> 26:52.400
So, this study

26:52.402 --> 26:56.037
had researchers put a bunch
of couples into a lab

26:56.039 --> 26:57.204
and had them ask each other

26:57.206 --> 26:59.340
a series
of intimate questions.

26:59.342 --> 27:00.842
Sounds ridiculous.

27:00.844 --> 27:02.144
At the end of the study,

27:02.146 --> 27:03.577
they had to stare
into each other's eyes

27:03.579 --> 27:07.382
for four minutes
without saying a word.

27:07.384 --> 27:08.817
So, you think
you're gonna make me

27:08.819 --> 27:11.754
fall in love by asking me
these questions?

27:13.123 --> 27:14.788
Okay, so there
are 36 questions.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.191
Okay, so we're doing this?

27:16.193 --> 27:17.759
But nobody's got time
for all that.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.762
So, how about I pick
ten randomly?

27:20.797 --> 27:23.700
Okay, question number one.

27:25.001 --> 27:26.299
What are the five
key ingredients

27:26.301 --> 27:28.470
to falling in love?

27:28.472 --> 27:30.808
This is so idiotic.
Um...

27:32.108 --> 27:33.240
Fine.

27:33.242 --> 27:35.242
Uh... Mutual self-interest

27:35.244 --> 27:38.247
and socioeconomic
compatibility.

27:39.382 --> 27:40.847
Okay.

27:40.849 --> 27:45.053
Well, my ingredients are
friendship and chemistry.

27:45.055 --> 27:46.453
Mmm. Of course they are.

27:46.455 --> 27:49.391
My last three are some
sort of moral compass...

27:49.393 --> 27:51.224
Common interests are a must.

27:51.226 --> 27:53.196
And let's see,

27:53.996 --> 27:55.195
the X factor.

27:55.197 --> 27:57.832
What in the world
is the X factor?

27:57.834 --> 27:59.603
Don't worry. We've got it.

28:02.239 --> 28:03.305
You know what...

28:03.307 --> 28:04.538
I hate to break this to you,

28:04.540 --> 28:06.074
but taking this little quiz

28:06.076 --> 28:09.877
isn't gonna make me change
my mind, Mr. Plaid Tie.

28:09.879 --> 28:11.746
Did you just call me Pad Thai?

28:11.748 --> 28:12.881
Plaid Tie.

28:12.883 --> 28:15.115
Because not only
is that completely racist,

28:15.117 --> 28:16.518
but also culturally
insensitive

28:16.520 --> 28:18.318
as my family is from Korea,
not Thailand.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.686
Well, that is not what I said,

28:19.688 --> 28:21.789
so you can stop waiting
for an apology.

28:21.791 --> 28:25.228
Oh, I'm waiting for something,
but not for an apology.

28:39.341 --> 28:40.875
Where are you going?

28:40.877 --> 28:42.779
I told you I have a meeting.

28:44.446 --> 28:47.150
Uh, we still have
27 minutes left.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.217
Mmm-hmm.

28:49.219 --> 28:51.255
So, you coming or what?

29:14.877 --> 29:17.578
So, where do you see yourself
in five years?

29:17.580 --> 29:19.380
Is that actually
one of the questions?

29:19.382 --> 29:21.149
I might be improvising.

29:21.151 --> 29:23.751
Well, I want to be
a data scientist.

29:23.753 --> 29:24.751
What's that?

29:24.753 --> 29:27.388
It's a scientist
who analyzes data.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.789
We take large amounts
of information

29:28.791 --> 29:31.926
and strategize on how
to apply it practically.

29:31.928 --> 29:32.993
Like how?

29:32.995 --> 29:34.862
Like traffic flow,

29:34.864 --> 29:37.198
four-day work weeks
for big companies,

29:37.200 --> 29:40.101
personal time
versus productivity.

29:40.103 --> 29:42.369
All that jazz. Come on.

29:42.371 --> 29:44.439
You're passionate
about it, though, right?

29:44.441 --> 29:45.906
Yeah, well,
I'm passionate

29:45.908 --> 29:47.409
about walking on the moon.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.843
But I can't live
off of passion

29:48.845 --> 29:52.278
any more than I can
live off of love.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.647
It's a long life to spend

29:53.649 --> 29:55.849
doing something
you're not really into.

29:55.851 --> 29:59.519
It's a long life
to spend chasing dreams.

29:59.521 --> 30:01.888
You should really kick it
with my dad sometime.

30:01.890 --> 30:05.092
Am I reminding you
of a 50-year-old Korean man?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.861
Without the accent.

30:06.863 --> 30:11.031
So, he's not crazy
about you pursuing poetry?

30:11.033 --> 30:13.634
Oh, no. I'm first-generation.

30:13.636 --> 30:14.836
And?

30:14.838 --> 30:16.770
It means it doesn't matter
what I want.

30:16.772 --> 30:21.041
According to my parents,
I'm meant to be a doctor.

30:21.043 --> 30:24.545
Oh. You know, at least when
you're a doctor making bank,

30:24.547 --> 30:26.079
you can thank them
for not letting you

30:26.081 --> 30:28.149
be a starving artist.

30:28.151 --> 30:31.521
It's hard to be passionate
when you're hungry.

30:32.321 --> 30:34.290
This is me.

30:46.903 --> 30:48.572
You're kidding.

30:51.107 --> 30:53.508
This is where my interview
was supposed to be.

30:53.510 --> 30:55.242
Come on. Honestly?

30:55.244 --> 30:57.112
I'm serious.
What are you doing here?

30:57.114 --> 30:58.913
Personal.

30:58.915 --> 31:00.381
Okay.

31:00.383 --> 31:02.549
But you gotta admit,

31:02.551 --> 31:05.419
this definitely
proves my point.

31:05.421 --> 31:07.321
Fate is real.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.589
Wait, I think
you mean coincidences,

31:09.591 --> 31:11.792
'cause they can happen
without meaning.

31:11.794 --> 31:12.896
Okay.

31:14.897 --> 31:16.329
Okay.

31:16.331 --> 31:17.632
I'll wait here for you

31:17.634 --> 31:18.801
and then we'll finish
the questions.

31:20.136 --> 31:23.807
Daniel, I should really
go home right after this.

31:24.941 --> 31:27.010
Today is a big day.

31:28.110 --> 31:31.314
So, I think this is where
we say goodbye.

31:36.185 --> 31:37.386
Um...

31:40.289 --> 31:42.722
Am I gonna see you again?

31:42.724 --> 31:45.660
The odds aren't in your favor.

31:45.662 --> 31:47.931
I'm guessing 1 in 8 million.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.532
I really think
I could have changed your mind

31:52.534 --> 31:53.936
if I had the whole day.

31:55.371 --> 31:58.541
Too bad you couldn't prove
your hypothesis.

32:00.777 --> 32:04.081
It was nice to save your life,
Natasha.

32:05.348 --> 32:08.383
Nice meeting you, Daniel.

32:08.385 --> 32:11.019
You know, good luck
with everything.

32:11.021 --> 32:14.087
Honestly, I hope
the interview goes well.

32:14.089 --> 32:15.458
Figure all that out.

32:16.459 --> 32:18.058
Thanks.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.495
Thanks again.

32:27.503 --> 32:29.905
You know,
I'm gonna prove my hypothesis!

32:31.007 --> 32:33.473
Love is real.

32:33.475 --> 32:35.978
This isn't the last time
I'm gonna see you.

32:37.579 --> 32:39.445
If I gotta hit up
all the boroughs,

32:39.447 --> 32:41.582
we're gonna see
each other again.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.553
You can't stop
what's meant to be.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.224
<i>The Theory of Multiverse</i>

32:51.226 --> 32:53.461
<i>was set forth originally
by Hugh Everett</i>

32:53.463 --> 32:55.363
<i>in quantum mechanics.</i>

32:55.365 --> 32:57.030
<i>It posited that every version</i>

32:57.032 --> 32:59.866
<i>of our past and future
histories exists,</i>

32:59.868 --> 33:01.937
<i>just in an alternate universe.</i>

33:04.139 --> 33:06.641
<i>This means that for every
choice you make,</i>

33:06.643 --> 33:08.910
<i>an infinite number
of universes exist</i>

33:08.912 --> 33:10.711
<i>where you made
a different choice.</i>

33:10.713 --> 33:14.048
<i>In this way,
we get to live multiple lives.</i>

33:14.050 --> 33:17.620

33:27.128 --> 33:29.195
Perfect. Okay, thank you.

33:30.398 --> 33:32.066
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:32.068 --> 33:33.634
Uh, I'm Natasha Kingsley.

33:33.636 --> 33:35.002
I was just about to call you.

33:35.004 --> 33:38.140
I am so sorry,
but I have some bad news.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.942
Mr. Martinez
was biking in to work

33:41.944 --> 33:43.644
when he got clipped by a car.

33:43.646 --> 33:45.278
But he was lucky.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.213
Just a few bruises.

33:47.215 --> 33:48.482
He'll be back around 4:30.

33:48.484 --> 33:49.951
Can you come back then?

33:49.953 --> 33:51.250
Law offices
of Jeremy Martinez.

33:51.252 --> 33:52.787
Of course. Of course.

33:52.789 --> 33:54.454
Um, I was supposed to help
my mother but I'll be here.

33:54.456 --> 33:56.289
Great. I need you
to fill these out.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.525
I already have my case files.

33:57.527 --> 33:58.792
You still need
to fill these out.

33:58.794 --> 34:00.394
You can take a seat
right over there.

34:00.396 --> 34:01.429
Okay.

34:01.431 --> 34:02.732
How can I help you?

34:12.175 --> 34:14.844
<i>"Have you ever

Flip your hair a little bit.

35:32.021 --> 35:34.120
We've had a lot of cases
like yours recently.

35:34.122 --> 35:35.890
I think Mr. Martinez
may be able

35:35.892 --> 35:37.993
to help you reopen your case.

35:38.627 --> 35:40.127
Honestly?

35:40.129 --> 35:42.296
I can't make any promises,
especially these days.

35:42.298 --> 35:45.267
But be back 4:30 sharp.

36:04.886 --> 36:06.720
- Hey, Tash.
- Oh!

36:06.722 --> 36:09.823
Hey. Doing nicknames now?

36:09.825 --> 36:12.658
Yeah. How'd your thing go?

36:12.660 --> 36:15.595
Uh... I have to come back
at 4:30.

36:15.597 --> 36:17.932
I guess that just
gives you four hours

36:17.934 --> 36:21.234
to just hang out with me or...

36:21.236 --> 36:25.272
I mean,
I should still go home.

36:25.274 --> 36:27.607
Okay, yeah, how long
does that take?

36:27.609 --> 36:30.044
45, 50ish minutes?

36:30.046 --> 36:31.312
One way?

36:31.314 --> 36:32.578
Yeah.

36:32.580 --> 36:34.548
That's like two hours.

36:34.550 --> 36:37.718
Just to be home
then turn around?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.754
Okay, you make
some fair points.

36:39.756 --> 36:41.024
Yeah.

36:41.557 --> 36:43.124
So?

36:43.126 --> 36:48.298
I have, uh, this thing uptown.
My parents.

36:49.631 --> 36:50.997
- Your parents?
- Yeah.

36:50.999 --> 36:52.133
I just gotta
drop something off.

36:52.135 --> 36:55.336
It's not a big deal at all.

I'm sorry this isn't exactly
the sexiest first date.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.598
Never agreed it was a date.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.201
Oh, it is. You'll see.

37:28.203 --> 37:30.872
I wish I could just bottle
your confidence and sell it.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.772
'Cause I'd make
a shit ton of money.

37:32.774 --> 37:34.542
I'm not that confident.

Okay.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.254
This is it.

37:47.256 --> 37:50.258
- This is your family's store?
- Mmm-hmm.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.359
Your family,

37:52.361 --> 37:56.596
the South Korean immigrants,
own a black hair care store?

37:56.598 --> 37:57.932
Yes.

37:57.934 --> 37:59.834
My family
of South Korean immigrants

37:59.836 --> 38:03.270
do own a black hair
care store.

38:03.272 --> 38:05.171
Passion project?

38:05.173 --> 38:08.210
It seems random, but it's not.

38:10.747 --> 38:12.513
<i>See, in the 60s,</i>

38:12.515 --> 38:15.484
<i>wigs made from South Korean
hair were extremely popular.</i>

38:18.486 --> 38:20.220
<i>Around that time,</i>

38:20.222 --> 38:22.756
<i>the South Korean government
banned the export of hair,</i>

38:22.758 --> 38:24.390
<i>making it difficult for anyone</i>

38:24.392 --> 38:27.129
<i>other than Koreans
to make wigs.</i>

38:28.231 --> 38:29.796
<i>Then the U.S. government</i>

38:29.798 --> 38:31.765
<i>banned wigs
made from Chinese hair.</i>

38:31.767 --> 38:36.169
<i>This gave Koreans full control
over the entire wig industry</i>

38:36.171 --> 38:38.571
<i>and the wig business evolved
into the more general</i>

38:38.573 --> 38:40.441
<i>black hair care business.</i>

38:40.443 --> 38:45.479
<i>Which, South Koreans
currently control 60 to 80%.</i>

38:45.481 --> 38:49.283
Aisle one is shampoos,
conditioners, dyes,

38:49.285 --> 38:51.484
a bunch of other things
that I don't understand.

38:51.486 --> 38:55.390
Aisle three is weaves,
uh, wigs...

38:56.292 --> 38:58.024
Wow.

38:58.026 --> 39:00.127
This place is huge.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.964
Uh, can I get you anything?

39:02.966 --> 39:05.265
I think I'm set on gel,
but thanks.

39:05.267 --> 39:06.600
No. No!

39:06.602 --> 39:09.136
Uh, I didn't mean a product.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.736
Uh, my dad's got a fridge
in the back

39:10.738 --> 39:12.339
with like soda and...

39:12.341 --> 39:14.375
Mmm, got it. Okay.

39:14.377 --> 39:15.676
Yeah. Thanks.

39:15.678 --> 39:17.380
- A soda would be great.
- Mmm-hmm.

39:29.258 --> 39:31.390
Pink?

39:31.392 --> 39:32.292
Why not?

39:32.294 --> 39:33.961
Doesn't seem like your style.

39:33.963 --> 39:36.430
You never know
what might work.

39:36.432 --> 39:37.433
Hmm.

39:38.267 --> 39:39.566
Mmm-hmm.

39:39.568 --> 39:42.269
I think you'd look beautiful
with a giant, pink afro.

39:42.271 --> 39:45.571
Well, not the whole
thing, just the ends.

39:45.573 --> 39:48.174
- Cool.
- Yeah.

39:48.176 --> 39:49.843
Your hair looks really soft.

39:49.845 --> 39:51.879
You think it can take
all that dye?

39:51.881 --> 39:55.048
Well, you're the black hair
care expert.

39:55.050 --> 39:57.850
So, why don't you feel it
and tell me?

39:57.852 --> 39:59.120
Really?

39:59.122 --> 40:01.857
It's a one-time-only offer.

40:11.334 --> 40:13.267
Aw! What's going on here?

40:13.269 --> 40:14.571
Uh...

40:15.203 --> 40:16.770
Oh, God.

40:16.772 --> 40:18.772
This is my older brother,
Charlie.

40:18.774 --> 40:20.741
This is my friend, Natasha.

40:20.743 --> 40:23.009
Friend? Oh!

40:23.011 --> 40:24.845
I thought maybe
he just caught a shoplifter.

40:24.847 --> 40:26.446
What did you just say?

40:26.448 --> 40:29.049
Hey, we get a lot of those
in a store like this, right?

40:29.051 --> 40:30.316
- I'm sure you understand.
- Wow.

40:30.318 --> 40:31.685
What the hell is your problem?

40:31.687 --> 40:33.088
What?

40:33.789 --> 40:35.388
What?

40:35.390 --> 40:37.089
- Tough guy in a suit now. Huh?
- Daniel, let's just go.

40:37.091 --> 40:38.191
Don't touch me.

40:38.193 --> 40:39.625
Let's go.

40:39.627 --> 40:40.863
Go.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.332

41:04.787 --> 41:08.424
- Bae.
- Mr. Bae, I'm Natasha.

41:11.327 --> 41:14.227
You're a friend of Daniel's.

41:14.229 --> 41:15.962
Would you like something
before you leave?

41:15.964 --> 41:17.499
What, for free?

41:19.133 --> 41:21.536
Not this aisle.
Come with me.

41:24.606 --> 41:25.607
Ah.

41:27.510 --> 41:30.678
Relaxer for your hair.
Make your hair not so big.

41:32.214 --> 41:35.415
Thank you, Mr. Bae,
but I like my hair big.

41:35.417 --> 41:37.752
Oh, if you like big,
you should get yourself a man,

41:37.754 --> 41:39.153
'cause little Danny here...

41:39.155 --> 41:40.888
Yeah, 'cause my dick
is an inch long,

41:40.890 --> 41:42.154
still twice as big as yours.

41:42.156 --> 41:45.028
I gotta go.

41:46.361 --> 41:49.897
You know, it could not
have gone any worse.

41:49.899 --> 41:51.298
What a combo.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.299
I mean, maybe I should have
gotten the relaxer

41:53.301 --> 41:55.134
just to make him like me more.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.841
I'm glad you find this funny.

42:01.843 --> 42:04.211
Dude, tragedy is funny.

42:04.213 --> 42:07.980
Sometimes you gotta laugh
to keep from crying.

42:07.982 --> 42:10.250
Are we in a tragedy?

42:10.252 --> 42:12.252
That's what life is.

42:12.254 --> 42:15.091
You know,
we all die in the end.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.500
Hey...

42:26.535 --> 42:28.136
I'm sorry.

42:28.805 --> 42:30.506
Daniel...

42:31.307 --> 42:34.374
you're not your dad.

42:34.376 --> 42:39.212
And you're for sure
not your brother.

42:39.214 --> 42:42.917
And they shouldn't be mad
at you because of me.

42:42.919 --> 42:44.484
They should be mad

42:44.486 --> 42:46.919
because you stole all
the good looks in the family.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.268
Thank you.

43:00.401 --> 43:03.106
I still have three hours.

43:04.673 --> 43:06.140
So, where to?

43:06.142 --> 43:08.040
I have one
of my favorite spots.

43:08.042 --> 43:09.509
Okay.

43:09.511 --> 43:11.412
- Soccer.
- Really?

43:11.414 --> 43:14.381
Yeah. All I hear is the ball,
like, thudding on the ground.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.848
It doesn't even
make any sense.

43:15.850 --> 43:16.984
'Cause soccer, isn't the ball

43:16.986 --> 43:18.285
supposed to stay
on the ground?

43:18.287 --> 43:20.790
Yeah, I mean,
unless you kick it.

43:30.798 --> 43:33.000
Wow.

43:33.002 --> 43:35.271
Thank you
for bringing me here.

44:36.731 --> 44:39.232
Makes you feel minuscule
and so important

44:39.234 --> 44:42.403
at the same time.

44:42.405 --> 44:45.841
Passionate about it,
you should be an astronomer.

44:47.510 --> 44:50.146
No, but really, though.

44:52.347 --> 44:54.182
But you love it.

45:29.151 --> 45:30.886
<i>Tugged this way and that.</i>

45:32.854 --> 45:36.525
<i>By the powerful, ever-present
force of gravity.</i>

45:38.993 --> 45:41.329
<i>At times, they even collide.</i>

45:42.464 --> 45:44.863
<i>This may sound alarming,</i>

45:44.865 --> 45:46.768
<i>but collisions
can actually be beneficial...</i>

45:48.069 --> 45:50.573
<i>and sometimes beautiful.</i>

46:30.912 --> 46:32.881
- Okay.
- Next question.

46:35.017 --> 46:37.520
Hmm. Okay.

47:46.555 --> 47:47.790
Perfect timing.

47:51.193 --> 47:53.593
- Where are we going?
- <i>Noraebang.</i>

47:53.595 --> 47:55.761
- Uh, in here?
- Mmm-hmm. Korean karaoke.

47:55.763 --> 47:57.897
No, I'm not doing it,
Daniel Bae.

47:57.899 --> 47:58.901
I'm not doing it.

48:05.441 --> 48:06.939
You know,

48:06.941 --> 48:10.944
in <i>Noraebang</i> you don't
choose the song.

48:10.946 --> 48:13.080
The song chooses you.

48:13.082 --> 48:17.917
There goes that overly
dramatic poet again.

48:17.919 --> 48:21.620
- Glad you recognize.
- Yeah.

48:21.622 --> 48:24.290
Do you know what I recognize?

48:24.292 --> 48:26.258
I recognize that

48:26.260 --> 48:30.462
almost every poem I've read
is about three things.

48:30.464 --> 48:34.100
Love, sex, and the stars.

48:34.102 --> 48:35.468
Stars are important.

48:35.470 --> 48:36.736
Didn't we just learn that

48:36.738 --> 48:38.504
- at the planetarium?
- Sure, but...

48:38.506 --> 48:41.040
I don't know. Why not more
poems about the sun?

48:41.042 --> 48:42.743
The sun is also a star.

48:42.745 --> 48:44.745
Just 'cause it's the most
important star

48:44.747 --> 48:46.846
doesn't make it poetic.

48:46.848 --> 48:50.816
The sun is a benevolent star.

48:50.818 --> 48:52.721
A giver.

48:53.821 --> 48:56.992
It's our greatest symbol
of hope.

48:58.426 --> 49:00.695
That's worth writing about.

49:03.432 --> 49:05.033
Fine.

49:07.669 --> 49:11.537
I'll only write poems about
the sun from now on.

49:11.539 --> 49:13.408
Thank you.

49:14.008 --> 49:15.744
And sex.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.872
Gotta be ready in case
the song calls for it.

50:06.995 --> 50:11.499

53:55.957 --> 53:57.859
Today is not a coincidence.

53:58.693 --> 54:00.696
It led me to you.

54:23.452 --> 54:26.051
- I gotta go right now.
- What's wrong?

54:26.053 --> 54:28.421
These dreams are
screwing up my entire life.

54:28.423 --> 54:29.788
I can't do this.

54:29.790 --> 54:31.490
Natasha!

54:31.492 --> 54:33.294
Natasha, what's wrong?

54:37.698 --> 54:39.531
Natasha!

54:39.533 --> 54:42.236
Natasha! Just wait!

54:42.736 --> 54:44.671
Natasha!

54:44.673 --> 54:47.374
What just happened back there?

54:47.376 --> 54:48.941
Just talk to me.

54:48.943 --> 54:50.676
What are you so afraid of?
Hmm?

54:50.678 --> 54:51.944
What are you so afraid of?

54:51.946 --> 54:54.180
Of being late
to my appointment.

54:54.182 --> 54:56.783
Or are you afraid of this?

54:56.785 --> 54:58.651
I know this is real.

54:58.653 --> 55:01.654
And I know you feel it, too.

55:01.656 --> 55:02.955
Natasha...

55:02.957 --> 55:05.191
Daniel, I know you think
that us meeting

55:05.193 --> 55:07.294
is fate or destiny
or whatever,

55:07.296 --> 55:09.127
but it can't be real,
because I'm probably

55:09.129 --> 55:11.733
never gonna see you again.

55:13.568 --> 55:16.069
What? Why not?

55:16.071 --> 55:18.305
Because I wasn't born here.

55:18.307 --> 55:21.443
Because my family
is being deported tomorrow.

55:23.111 --> 55:25.011
You're leaving tomorrow?

55:25.013 --> 55:27.316
Yeah. For good.

55:29.017 --> 55:30.383
You're just making it harder,
Daniel.

55:30.385 --> 55:31.884
But there's gotta be
something we can do.

55:31.886 --> 55:33.118
Just wait, Natasha, just wait.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.787
There's gotta be
something we can do.

55:34.789 --> 55:36.855
I'm right here.

55:36.857 --> 55:41.530
I'm not a dream. Okay?
I'm right here.

55:43.265 --> 55:45.866
Stay.

55:45.868 --> 55:47.966
- Thank you for saving my life.
- Natasha.

55:47.968 --> 55:50.203
- Natasha. Natasha!
- No. Leave me alone.

55:50.205 --> 55:52.174
I don't even have your number!

57:00.408 --> 57:01.841
Hi.

57:01.843 --> 57:03.410
Perfect timing, Miss Kingsley.

57:03.412 --> 57:05.243
Follow me, please.

57:05.245 --> 57:06.979
He's a little banged up
after the accident,

57:06.981 --> 57:10.017
but extremely dedicated
to his cases.

57:14.756 --> 57:16.055
Yep?

57:16.057 --> 57:18.156
Mr. Martinez,
this is Natasha Kingsley.

57:18.158 --> 57:19.691
Thank you.

57:19.693 --> 57:21.560
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

57:21.562 --> 57:23.361
Nice to meet you, too.

57:23.363 --> 57:25.932
Thanks for squeezing me in.

57:25.934 --> 57:28.035
- Sorry.
- No, it's okay. Please sit.

57:30.238 --> 57:36.075
I've had a chance to
review your file and, uh,

57:36.077 --> 57:39.044
what I'd like to do
is see the judge

57:39.046 --> 57:41.247
who issued
this removal order, okay?

57:41.249 --> 57:44.216
I went to school with him.
He's a good guy.

57:44.218 --> 57:46.551
And he'll be able to stop
the deportation?

57:46.553 --> 57:49.256
Well, he might let me file
a motion to reopen the case

57:49.258 --> 57:53.225
and then we can reverse this
voluntary removal. All right?

57:53.227 --> 57:55.495
And then, at least you won't
have to leave tomorrow.

57:55.497 --> 57:57.596
And I should have an answer
from the judge in the morning.

57:57.598 --> 58:00.098
And then probably
we should meet again.

58:00.100 --> 58:02.133
10 o'clock all right with you?

58:02.135 --> 58:05.437
Okay, uh, well, then what?

58:05.439 --> 58:07.506
Well, then I'll ask
for a new trial

58:07.508 --> 58:11.343
and submit a petition
for permanent resident status.

58:11.345 --> 58:12.578
Okay?

58:12.580 --> 58:14.049
How's that sound to you?

58:15.117 --> 58:17.986
Like somebody finally cares.

58:25.126 --> 58:27.093
Hey,
you're back early.

58:27.095 --> 58:29.428
You finished with
the interview already?

58:29.430 --> 58:30.595
What happened?

58:30.597 --> 58:32.066
You can tell me.
You can tell me anything.

58:32.934 --> 58:34.200
Why the long face, man?

58:34.202 --> 58:36.968
Shut up, Charlie.

58:36.970 --> 58:40.105
So, how did your fancy college
interview go, Doctor Bae? Hmm?

58:40.107 --> 58:42.274
We finally got a doctor
in the house?

58:42.276 --> 58:44.509
Someone to be proud of?

58:44.511 --> 58:47.046
Oh, come on, you really got
nothing to say to me?

58:47.048 --> 58:49.383
No, <i>Hyung.</i> I don't.

58:51.319 --> 58:53.852
Hey. I told you not
to call me that.

58:53.854 --> 58:55.321
Oh, shit, you're right.

58:55.323 --> 58:58.060
Someone might find out
you're actually Korean.

58:59.127 --> 59:00.359
You think
that little black girl

59:00.361 --> 59:02.428
made your balls grow? Huh?

59:02.430 --> 59:04.763
Oh, no,
you're the little bitch

59:04.765 --> 59:07.332
who can't think for himself
without their approval.

59:07.334 --> 59:09.437
Yeah, that's what you are.

59:11.106 --> 59:12.671
Well, I'm sorry.

59:12.673 --> 59:18.877
I'm sorry not everybody can be
as badass or edgy as you.

59:18.879 --> 59:22.948
Staying at home,
eating their food,

59:22.950 --> 59:24.350
breaking Mom's heart.

59:24.352 --> 59:27.586
Fuck you! You think
you're better than me?

59:27.588 --> 59:28.622
Hmm?

59:30.658 --> 59:32.323
- Just let me ask you...
- Yeah.

59:32.325 --> 59:34.495
I'd do her, afro and all!

59:38.566 --> 59:39.765
You...

01:00:12.466 --> 01:00:14.735
Get some ice for your lip.

01:01:22.169 --> 01:01:25.071
Doctor Bae. Doctor Bae.

01:01:25.073 --> 01:01:26.337
Doctor Bae.

01:01:26.339 --> 01:01:28.577
- Doctor Bae.
- Doctor Bae.

01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:40.352
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:01:40.354 --> 01:01:41.921
Forget about Charlie.

01:01:41.923 --> 01:01:43.890
The only thing that matters
is your interview.

01:01:43.892 --> 01:01:45.156
And you go to good college,

01:01:45.158 --> 01:01:47.359
you become doctor,
you be success.

01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:49.028
What if I don't want
the same things

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.430
you and <i>Umma</i> want, <i>Appa?</i>

01:01:50.432 --> 01:01:53.566
Daniel, it is about
the family name.

01:01:53.568 --> 01:01:55.935
It's about honor
for all of us.

01:01:55.937 --> 01:01:57.336
But what about what I need?

01:01:57.338 --> 01:02:00.171
"I, I, I."
America is all about "I."

01:02:00.173 --> 01:02:01.674
You do not throw away
your future.

01:02:01.676 --> 01:02:02.975
<i>Appa!</i>

01:02:02.977 --> 01:02:05.377
If you do not go to college,
you're on your own!

01:02:08.082 --> 01:02:09.917
"Yeah, <i>Appa."</i>

01:02:12.754 --> 01:02:14.489
"Yeah, <i>Appa."</i>

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:24.229
Daniel!

01:03:02.537 --> 01:03:04.002
<i>When my mother, Min Soo,</i>

01:03:04.004 --> 01:03:05.970
<i>fell in love with my father,
Dae Hyun,</i>

01:03:05.972 --> 01:03:07.605
<i>she didn't expect
it would take them</i>

01:03:07.607 --> 01:03:09.810
<i>from South Korea to America.</i>

01:03:10.778 --> 01:03:12.343
<i>When my mom and dad learned</i>

01:03:12.345 --> 01:03:13.779
<i>that they were going
to have a baby,</i>

01:03:13.781 --> 01:03:15.915
<i>they struggled with what
to name it.</i>

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.350
<i>See, in America,</i>

01:03:17.352 --> 01:03:19.986
<i>the family name
is called the last name.</i>

01:03:19.988 --> 01:03:21.319
<i>My father said it showed</i>

01:03:21.321 --> 01:03:22.687
<i>that Americans think
the individual</i>

01:03:22.689 --> 01:03:25.057
<i>is more important
than the family.</i>

01:03:25.059 --> 01:03:27.894
<i>But in Korea,
the family name came first</i>

01:03:27.896 --> 01:03:31.696
<i>and told the entire history
of your ancestry.</i>

01:03:31.698 --> 01:03:33.732
<i>When my brother was born
they picked an American name,</i>

01:03:33.734 --> 01:03:35.667
<i>followed by a Korean
personal name,</i>

01:03:35.669 --> 01:03:37.270
<i>followed by the family name.</i>

01:03:39.006 --> 01:03:41.841
<i>Then a couple of years later,
they named me.</i>

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.178
<i>So, in the end,
they chose both.</i>

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.180
<i>Korean and American.
American and Korean.</i>

01:03:48.182 --> 01:03:50.582
<i>That way, we would know
where we were from</i>

01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:53.252
<i>and where we were going.</i>

01:03:53.254 --> 01:03:54.819
All right. Thank you.

01:03:54.821 --> 01:03:56.087
Thank you.

01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:57.292
Bye.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600
Mmm. You look great.

01:04:07.602 --> 01:04:09.734
Thanks. Your boy's not here.

01:04:09.736 --> 01:04:13.805
Yeah, I know.
I need his number.

01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:15.876
- You need his number?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:04:16.843 --> 01:04:19.410
- From me?
- That's what I just said.

01:04:19.412 --> 01:04:21.180
Danny's number? From me?

01:04:21.182 --> 01:04:23.515
You gonna give it
to me or not?

01:04:23.517 --> 01:04:24.783
What's your deal?

01:04:24.785 --> 01:04:26.319
You have an Asian fetish
or something?

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:28.120
I just have something
really important

01:04:28.122 --> 01:04:29.824
that I need to tell him.

01:04:31.959 --> 01:04:33.895
You really like him, huh?

01:04:35.463 --> 01:04:37.564
Yeah, I do.

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:50.908
Here.

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.310
Thank you.

01:04:52.312 --> 01:04:55.050
Yeah, okay. You're welcome.

01:04:58.252 --> 01:04:59.685
All right. Great. Great.

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.690
Yep, all right. Hey.

01:05:02.388 --> 01:05:04.358
Don't break his heart.

01:05:15.269 --> 01:05:17.169
Hello?

01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:18.707
<i>Hey.</i>

01:05:19.272 --> 01:05:20.406
Natasha?

01:05:20.408 --> 01:05:22.307
Hi.

01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:23.975
<i>How'd you get my...</i>

01:05:23.977 --> 01:05:27.479
Your brother gave me
your number.

01:05:27.481 --> 01:05:29.348
My brother gave you my number?

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:32.283
<i>I have it and it's me.</i>

01:05:33.787 --> 01:05:37.388

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:40.292

- Lightning round.
- Okay.

01:07:58.531 --> 01:08:01.267
What is your most
treasured memory?

01:08:01.269 --> 01:08:03.468
- Oh. When we first got here...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:07.006
...my dad took us to see
the fireworks at Coney Island.

01:08:07.008 --> 01:08:11.544
We ate fried dough,
went on all the rides.

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:15.980
Just kind of magical.
Is that cheesy?

01:08:15.982 --> 01:08:18.984
- He was different then.
- Your dad?

01:08:18.986 --> 01:08:20.419
Yeah.

01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:25.322
He's the reason we're here,
but it's not even his fault.

01:08:25.323 --> 01:08:26.925
No, it's not his fault

01:08:26.926 --> 01:08:29.795
that ICE does
these random raids.

01:08:29.796 --> 01:08:34.032
And he was working
in the kitchen that day.

01:08:34.033 --> 01:08:36.870
Nine years here, then boom.

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:39.840
Man, I'm sorry.

01:08:41.573 --> 01:08:44.243
It's all sorts of complicated.

01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:54.888
God, I love this city.

01:10:43.497 --> 01:10:44.966
Don't fall.

01:10:50.471 --> 01:10:52.839
I got him! I got him!

01:10:57.311 --> 01:11:00.715
Day's sweetest moments
are at dawn.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.861
Good morning.

01:11:15.863 --> 01:11:18.199
I could get used
to waking up like this.

01:11:20.734 --> 01:11:22.803
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

01:11:26.606 --> 01:11:28.939
My bangs
are probably everywhere.

01:11:31.378 --> 01:11:33.481
Any more questions?

01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:36.417
Kiss me?

01:11:39.287 --> 01:11:41.452
What time is it?

01:11:41.454 --> 01:11:42.586
- Uh...
- You don't wanna

01:11:42.588 --> 01:11:44.456
miss your interview.

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:47.526
- Oh, shit. It's 7:15.
- Hmm! Oh, we gotta go.

01:11:47.528 --> 01:11:49.393
- Come on. Come on.
- Yeah.

01:11:49.395 --> 01:11:52.096
Yeah, it's interview time.
Come on.

01:11:52.098 --> 01:11:53.331
You got everything?
Come on, come on.

01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:55.435
Yeah. Careful.
Careful.

01:12:09.816 --> 01:12:11.252
What?

01:12:12.619 --> 01:12:13.921
I don't know.

01:12:15.489 --> 01:12:16.822
You're going in there,

01:12:16.824 --> 01:12:19.224
you're gonna kill
this interview

01:12:19.226 --> 01:12:23.097
and I'll wait here for you
until my appointment.

01:12:23.864 --> 01:12:25.199
You're good.

01:12:30.436 --> 01:12:32.537
Are you okay?

01:12:32.539 --> 01:12:35.139
- What if I have to leave?
- You're not leaving.

01:12:35.141 --> 01:12:37.910
- How do you know that?
- Because I know.

01:12:37.912 --> 01:12:39.879
The universe wants us
to be together.

01:12:39.881 --> 01:12:42.013
You're not leaving, Natasha.

01:12:42.015 --> 01:12:44.282
Don't you see? That's what
this whole thing is.

01:12:44.284 --> 01:12:47.121
Even your jacket,
<i>deus ex machina.</i>

01:12:48.387 --> 01:12:50.156
It's fate.

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.160
So you have nothing
to worry about.

01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:58.363
Okay.

01:12:58.365 --> 01:13:03.104
Come on. You're gonna be late.
Go, go, go.

01:13:04.738 --> 01:13:06.537
I don't want to go.

01:13:06.539 --> 01:13:08.042
Go!

01:13:10.811 --> 01:13:12.643
You promise
you're gonna be here?

01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:14.214
I'll be here.

01:13:18.485 --> 01:13:21.252
We'll finish the questions
when you get back.

01:13:21.254 --> 01:13:25.025
- Go to your interview.
- I'm going. I'm going.

01:13:40.306 --> 01:13:42.340
Hi, Mommy!

01:13:42.342 --> 01:13:43.442
No, I...

01:13:43.444 --> 01:13:45.277
I'm so sorry.

01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:48.712
I should have reached out.
I'm safe, though.

01:13:48.714 --> 01:13:50.115
No, no, no.

01:13:50.117 --> 01:13:51.749
I graduated a long time ago.
Class of '92.

01:13:51.751 --> 01:13:53.151
Are you a Queens boy?

01:13:53.153 --> 01:13:54.853
- Yep.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:13:54.855 --> 01:13:56.020
Your mother's name is Min Soo?

01:13:56.022 --> 01:13:57.154
Yes.

01:13:57.156 --> 01:13:59.157
- Pretty, pretty.
- Thank you.

01:13:59.159 --> 01:14:01.428
Yeah. Soccer team.

01:14:02.262 --> 01:14:04.629
Forward.

01:14:04.631 --> 01:14:05.932
Must be fast.

01:14:07.066 --> 01:14:08.867
Asian Culture Club
vice president?

01:14:08.869 --> 01:14:11.038
Mmm-hmm. Yes, sir.

01:14:13.172 --> 01:14:14.540
Excellent interpersonal

01:14:14.542 --> 01:14:16.340
customer service skills.
What's that?

01:14:16.342 --> 01:14:19.210
Yes, sir. My, uh, father owns
a black hair care store.

01:14:19.212 --> 01:14:21.746
I work there part-time.

01:14:21.748 --> 01:14:24.581
Any community service,
that type of stuff?

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.185
Mmm-hmm. I volunteer
at the children's hospital

01:14:27.187 --> 01:14:29.621
in the Bronx twice a month.

01:14:29.623 --> 01:14:31.089
It's rewarding.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:33.358
I write poems
with the patients.

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.727
Takes their mind off
of being sick.

01:14:35.729 --> 01:14:37.696
Oh, so you like to write, huh?

01:14:37.698 --> 01:14:40.131
I do. I do. As a hobby.

01:14:40.133 --> 01:14:41.399
Yeah, yeah.
No, I feel like doctors

01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:43.001
should all be well-rounded,

01:14:43.003 --> 01:14:44.769
but, you know, it's rare.

01:14:44.771 --> 01:14:46.737
So, um...

01:14:46.739 --> 01:14:50.010
So when did you first know
you wanted to be a doctor?

01:14:56.115 --> 01:15:00.253
Never. Is that an okay answer?

01:15:01.788 --> 01:15:03.921
Yeah, I guess. If it's honest.

01:15:03.923 --> 01:15:05.157
It is.

01:15:05.159 --> 01:15:08.362
All right. Well,
let's go with that then.

01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:20.804
My parents want me
to be a doctor.

01:15:20.806 --> 01:15:23.474
I never wanted that.

01:15:23.476 --> 01:15:25.042
I just...

01:15:25.044 --> 01:15:28.582
I want to be a poet.

01:15:32.586 --> 01:15:35.588
So why the hell
do you wanna go to Dartmouth?

01:15:37.958 --> 01:15:42.493
Uh, my parents are immigrants.

01:15:42.495 --> 01:15:45.830
All they want is to give me
and my brother a better life.

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:47.965
It's all they ever wanted.

01:15:47.967 --> 01:15:49.902
But what about what you want?

01:15:49.904 --> 01:15:52.973
Doesn't that count
for something?

01:15:54.475 --> 01:15:57.242
I don't know.

01:15:57.244 --> 01:15:59.810
Okay. There's still
a chance, Mom.

01:15:59.812 --> 01:16:01.846
Will you please just listen
to me for once?

01:16:01.848 --> 01:16:03.415
All I'm saying is I'm here.

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:04.950
I have this appointment.
Give me an hour.

01:16:04.952 --> 01:16:06.550
- Miss Kingsley, you're early.
- Hi. Is he in there?

01:16:06.552 --> 01:16:08.085
- Yes, he is, but...
- Okay, great.

01:16:08.087 --> 01:16:09.353
- I'll be home in an hour.
- Hey, excuse me.

01:16:09.355 --> 01:16:10.589
I'm hanging up now.
Goodbye, Mom.

01:16:10.591 --> 01:16:12.390
Your appointment's
not until 10.

01:16:12.392 --> 01:16:13.457
Miss Kingsley you can't go
in there. He's in a meeting!

01:16:13.459 --> 01:16:14.792
So sorry for the interruption.

01:16:14.794 --> 01:16:16.594
Excuse me.
We're having a meeting here.

01:16:16.596 --> 01:16:18.565
- Tash?
- Daniel?

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:22.000
Destiny.

01:16:22.002 --> 01:16:25.071
What's going on here?

01:16:25.771 --> 01:16:27.304
This is...

01:16:27.306 --> 01:16:28.907
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

01:16:28.909 --> 01:16:30.943
You're fine. It's fine.
We were just finishing up.

01:16:30.945 --> 01:16:33.810
No, we're not. We're just
getting started right now.

01:16:33.812 --> 01:16:36.180
Can you tell me
what happened with the judge?

01:16:36.182 --> 01:16:37.482
I don't think you wanna
be talking about this

01:16:37.484 --> 01:16:39.017
in front of Mr. Bae
right here.

01:16:39.019 --> 01:16:41.685
You can say anything
in front of him. Just tell me.

01:16:41.687 --> 01:16:43.723
Can my family stay?

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.703
No. I'm sorry.

01:16:58.739 --> 01:17:02.407
So you're saying
I have to leave today?

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:04.309
Natasha, if there was anything
I could have done,

01:17:04.311 --> 01:17:06.143
I'm telling you,
I would have done it.

01:17:06.145 --> 01:17:08.412
You said you could fix it.

01:17:08.414 --> 01:17:12.550
I promised to try and I did.
I really did.

01:17:12.552 --> 01:17:15.319
Oh, your promises
don't mean shit!

01:17:15.321 --> 01:17:17.156
Look,
the current political climate,

01:17:17.158 --> 01:17:19.023
and the way they keep
changing policies...

01:17:19.025 --> 01:17:22.527
- I mean, I did all I could.
- You know what's so messed up?

01:17:22.529 --> 01:17:24.161
I'm so sorry, Tash.
I'm so sorry.

01:17:24.163 --> 01:17:26.096
You said this wasn't
gonna happen!

01:17:26.098 --> 01:17:27.564
You promised me

01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:29.568
- this wasn't gonna happen.
- So sorry. Natasha!

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:32.236
Hey! You didn't finish
your interview.

01:17:32.238 --> 01:17:34.005
Natasha only has
a few hours left.

01:17:34.007 --> 01:17:35.807
I'm not wasting
another second.

01:17:35.809 --> 01:17:37.375
Don't you want
the recommendation?

01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:40.144
Not more than I want the girl.

01:17:50.257 --> 01:17:53.327
Natasha! Natasha!

01:17:54.627 --> 01:17:56.594
Natasha, come on.
Natasha, please.

01:17:56.596 --> 01:17:58.496
- Wait, wait, wait. Just wait.
- I can't wait!

01:17:58.498 --> 01:17:59.930
- Wait.
- I can't wait.

01:17:59.932 --> 01:18:01.265
I have to go home.

01:18:01.267 --> 01:18:03.468
I have to pack.
I have so much to do.

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:04.969
I can help. I can help.

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.603
No, my parents are there.
Go back to your interview.

01:18:06.605 --> 01:18:08.005
- Go back.
- I don't care.

01:18:08.007 --> 01:18:09.441
I don't care about Dartmouth.

01:18:09.443 --> 01:18:11.041
It doesn't matter to me
the way that you do.

01:18:11.043 --> 01:18:12.577
You met me yesterday!

01:18:12.579 --> 01:18:14.879
- Get over it! Get over it.
- I don't wanna get over it.

01:18:14.881 --> 01:18:16.313
But you should!

01:18:16.315 --> 01:18:18.215
- But you should.
- I'm not gonna get over it.

01:18:18.217 --> 01:18:20.417
No, no. Here's what
we're not gonna do.

01:18:20.419 --> 01:18:21.885
We're not gonna act like this

01:18:21.887 --> 01:18:23.688
isn't the worst thing
on earth, 'cause it is.

01:18:23.690 --> 01:18:25.023
Okay?

01:18:25.025 --> 01:18:26.358
But I'm coming home with you.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.260
I'm gonna see where you eat,

01:18:28.262 --> 01:18:30.795
where you sleep,
where you live

01:18:30.797 --> 01:18:32.429
and I wish I could have
done it sooner,

01:18:32.431 --> 01:18:33.799
but now is better than never.

01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.332
Are you okay with that?

01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:37.568
I just don't wanna go.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:40.341
I just don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:45.546
I don't wanna go.

01:18:54.754 --> 01:18:56.690
I don't wanna...

01:19:02.195 --> 01:19:04.398
It's okay.

01:19:45.271 --> 01:19:47.471
I look homeless.

01:19:47.473 --> 01:19:50.441
You don't have to be nervous.

01:19:50.443 --> 01:19:52.643
I'm meeting your parents.

01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:56.147
Well, I mean,
the good thing is,

01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:58.349
you can screw up all you want.

01:19:58.351 --> 01:20:01.085
Never gonna see 'em again.

01:20:10.529 --> 01:20:12.831
Pass me that one there.

01:20:12.833 --> 01:20:14.566
Lord, Natasha!

01:20:14.568 --> 01:20:16.568
Peter, go turn
that damn music off.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:19.036
We didn't know
when you'd come home.

01:20:19.038 --> 01:20:20.738
Uh, mommy, this is Daniel.

01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:23.774
Sorry to meet you under these
circumstances, Mrs. Kingsley.

01:20:23.776 --> 01:20:25.309
Mmm.

01:20:25.311 --> 01:20:26.844
Dad, I'm sorry
that I stayed out.

01:20:26.846 --> 01:20:28.479
He's the reason why
you not come home last night?

01:20:28.481 --> 01:20:30.751
- Mr. Kingsley, it's my fault.
- Not a word, boy.

01:20:33.186 --> 01:20:35.353
We've been up all night.

01:20:35.355 --> 01:20:37.955
Thinking about you,
worried about you.

01:20:37.957 --> 01:20:39.957
And you've come home
with this stranger.

01:20:39.959 --> 01:20:43.060
Daniel's not a stranger.
He's my guest.

01:20:43.062 --> 01:20:44.431
Your guest?

01:20:45.798 --> 01:20:49.300
When you have your own home,
you can have a guest.

01:20:49.302 --> 01:20:51.372
But this here's my home.

01:20:52.705 --> 01:20:55.139
What makes this your home?

01:20:55.141 --> 01:20:57.341
A home is a place
you fight for.

01:20:57.343 --> 01:21:00.879
You don't even wanna stay.

01:21:00.881 --> 01:21:03.215
It's not simple, 'Tasha.

01:21:03.217 --> 01:21:05.452
What is it?

01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:10.658
I just wanted to give you all
so much more than this.

01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:17.064
I love you.

01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:21.401
But we are leaving.

01:21:24.738 --> 01:21:26.073
Okay.

01:22:47.552 --> 01:22:49.155
- Thank you, sir.
- Here's your bag.

01:23:02.401 --> 01:23:05.202
I don't know how
to say goodbye.

01:23:05.204 --> 01:23:06.539
Then don't.

01:23:08.975 --> 01:23:12.044
We still have one more
test to go.

01:23:12.878 --> 01:23:14.147
The stare.

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:22.655
Four minutes.
No talking.

01:23:24.891 --> 01:23:26.426
Ready?

01:23:34.367 --> 01:23:35.532
I'm not sure if we're supposed

01:23:35.534 --> 01:23:38.536
to hold hands
during this part,

01:23:38.538 --> 01:23:41.141
but the hell with it.

01:23:52.351 --> 01:23:53.720
It's all right.

01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.756
I'm right here.

01:24:42.901 --> 01:24:46.170
<i>Carl Sagan once said
that human beings</i>

01:24:46.172 --> 01:24:49.706
<i>are like butterflies
who flutter for a day</i>

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:52.011
<i>and think it's forever.</i>

01:24:56.749 --> 01:25:00.585
<i>Compared to the lifespan
of the universe,</i>

01:25:00.587 --> 01:25:04.191
<i>our lives begin and end
in a single day.</i>

01:25:09.029 --> 01:25:12.299
<i>I've come to understand it
this way.</i>

01:25:14.368 --> 01:25:16.901
<i>The stars aren't just
balls of gas</i>

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:20.106
<i>burning billions
of miles away.</i>

01:25:21.475 --> 01:25:23.241
<i>They are also a reminder</i>

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:27.080
<i>of the brief time
we share on this planet.</i>

01:25:30.182 --> 01:25:34.852
<i>At first, Daniel and I
stayed in touch.</i>

01:25:34.854 --> 01:25:36.220
<i>But time and distance</i>

01:25:36.222 --> 01:25:38.958
<i>are the heart's
natural enemies.</i>

01:25:40.459 --> 01:25:41.693
May each day be today.

01:25:41.695 --> 01:25:43.327
<i>Everyone we meet...</i>

01:25:45.498 --> 01:25:47.568
<i>...everyone we love...</i>

01:25:50.636 --> 01:25:53.006
<i>how we got here...</i>

01:25:57.342 --> 01:25:58.979
<i>what path we choose...</i>

01:26:02.147 --> 01:26:05.718
<i>and who we choose
to remember.</i>

01:26:09.254 --> 01:26:12.792
<i>They are all
a part of our story.</i>

01:26:20.232 --> 01:26:24.738
<i>But we cannot allow the story
to be written for us.</i>

01:26:27.539 --> 01:26:29.876
<i>Because we don't have forever.</i>

01:26:32.345 --> 01:26:33.981
<i>Sometimes...</i>

01:26:34.946 --> 01:26:39.819
<i>all we have is a single day.</i>

01:26:51.097 --> 01:26:52.897
I'm Daniel.

01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:55.499
You saved my life.

01:26:55.501 --> 01:26:56.903
Thank you.

01:27:44.751 --> 01:27:47.454
I love you, Daniel Bae.

01:27:54.461 --> 01:27:57.164
I guess the experiment worked.

01:29:20.579 --> 01:29:21.644
Uh...

01:29:21.646 --> 01:29:22.947
Sorry I'm late.

01:29:22.949 --> 01:29:24.749
No, just...
Thank you for coming.

01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:26.250
Yeah.

01:29:26.252 --> 01:29:28.419
So you found your way back
to New York City, huh?

01:29:28.421 --> 01:29:30.889
Wasn't easy. As you know.

01:29:30.891 --> 01:29:34.691
But my student visa finally
came through for grad school.

01:29:34.693 --> 01:29:36.393
So what are you studying?

01:29:36.395 --> 01:29:37.661
Astronomy.

01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:40.564
Um, I'm actually flying
to San Francisco tomorrow

01:29:40.566 --> 01:29:43.367
to start my PhD at Berkeley.

01:29:43.369 --> 01:29:44.635
Thank you.

01:29:44.637 --> 01:29:46.502
Dr. Natasha Kingsley.
Look at you.

01:29:46.504 --> 01:29:51.309
Thanks. But I need
to ask you a question.

01:29:51.311 --> 01:29:52.410
Yeah, sure.

01:29:52.412 --> 01:29:54.312
So, the day
my family got deported,

01:29:54.314 --> 01:29:56.712
there was a boy, Daniel Bae,

01:29:56.714 --> 01:30:00.119
who came to your office
to interview for Dartmouth.

01:30:00.686 --> 01:30:02.085
Okay.

01:30:02.087 --> 01:30:05.022
I haven't been able
to find him anywhere.

01:30:05.024 --> 01:30:07.457
I mean,
he's not online anymore.

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:09.359
It's literally
like he's vanished.

01:30:09.361 --> 01:30:11.929
And I was wondering
if you have

01:30:11.931 --> 01:30:14.298
any way of contacting him.

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:15.366
No. No.

01:30:15.368 --> 01:30:17.167
When he ran out of my office,

01:30:17.169 --> 01:30:19.370
that was the last time
I ever saw him.

01:30:19.372 --> 01:30:20.373
I'm sorry.

01:30:22.607 --> 01:30:23.807
I'll tell you something.

01:30:23.809 --> 01:30:25.475
You know why I remember
that day?

01:30:25.477 --> 01:30:28.078
- Hmm.
- Well, because I had

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.779
a million things
to do that morning,

01:30:29.781 --> 01:30:31.682
and I had
this accident, right?

01:30:31.684 --> 01:30:33.785
And I actually tried
to convince the EMTs

01:30:33.787 --> 01:30:35.786
not to take me
to the hospital.

01:30:35.788 --> 01:30:38.855
But I was glad they did.

01:30:38.857 --> 01:30:39.924
Why?

01:30:39.926 --> 01:30:41.457
Well, because...

01:30:42.962 --> 01:30:46.162
my doctor became my wife.

01:30:48.267 --> 01:30:49.334
Yeah!

01:30:49.336 --> 01:30:50.233
Oh, my God!

01:30:50.235 --> 01:30:52.638
I know, I know, I know.

01:30:55.141 --> 01:30:57.041
So, you know,

01:30:57.043 --> 01:31:00.377
sometimes you can't
control everything...

01:31:00.379 --> 01:31:02.278
I don't know. I don't know.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:06.653
Maybe just being open to fate,
maybe that's a choice.

01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:08.954
Maybe.

01:31:11.357 --> 01:31:12.590
Uh...

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:14.657
Good luck with everything.
I mean that.

01:31:14.659 --> 01:31:16.162
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:31:30.743 --> 01:31:32.376
That's it for me.

01:31:32.378 --> 01:31:35.015
We've got some more talent
coming out, so just sit tight.

01:32:07.513 --> 01:32:09.548
This is a poem
I wrote about the sun.

01:32:26.998 --> 01:32:28.200
Natasha.

01:32:37.008 --> 01:32:38.610
Wow.

01:32:40.913 --> 01:32:42.348
How?

01:32:44.850 --> 01:32:46.519
I like your glasses.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.455
I like the hair.

01:32:54.726 --> 01:32:56.395
I leave tomorrow.

01:32:59.998 --> 01:33:01.633
I only need a day.

01:33:02.235 --> 01:33:04.233
Mmm. Well...

01:33:04.235 --> 01:33:06.470
I don't really have a day.

01:33:06.472 --> 01:33:08.005
