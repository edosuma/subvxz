WEBVTT

00:09.510 --> 00:11.745
at the hospital
for sick children.
Tracy Hooper was given

00:11.845 --> 00:13.914
the liver of a nine-year-old
accident victim...

00:14.014 --> 00:16.016
( phone ringing )

00:16.117 --> 00:18.219
Hooper is in critical
but stable condition--

00:18.319 --> 00:20.154
such an operation.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.157
Her condition will be
monitored for 72 hours...

00:23.257 --> 00:24.625
( machine beeps )

00:24.725 --> 00:26.327
Paul, it's April.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.862
I-- I got
the test results.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.864
I'd like to come in

00:30.964 --> 00:34.335
for one last session.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.437
I'll see you
this afternoon.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.606
APRIL?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.276
( sighs )

00:43.611 --> 00:44.612
( beeps )

00:44.712 --> 00:46.847
Paul, it's April.

00:46.947 --> 00:50.684
I-- I got
the test results.

00:50.784 --> 00:51.985
I'd like to come in

00:52.086 --> 00:53.354
for one last session.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.223
I'll see you
this afternoon.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.425
( machine beeps )

00:59.160 --> 01:03.131
( theme music playing )

01:21.081 --> 01:23.851
IT'S THE HAT, ISN'T IT?

01:25.919 --> 01:28.622
IT LOOKS NICE.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.225
IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.295
SO YOUR MESSAGE--

01:34.395 --> 01:36.764
YOU GOT THE RESULTS?

01:36.864 --> 01:39.066
AND IT ITCHES LIKE CRAZY.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.602
YOU CAN TAKE IT OFF.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.271
NO.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.273
DANIEL GAVE IT TO ME.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.374
OH.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.442
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT YOU
TOLD HIM ABOUT--

01:48.542 --> 01:52.213
I DIDN'T.
MY MOTHER DID.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.981
I WAS AFRAID TO.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.351
AFRAID OF HOW
HE MIGHT REACT?

01:57.451 --> 02:00.288
I WAS AFRAID
THAT HE WOULDN'T REACT.

02:00.388 --> 02:04.292
I WAS AFRAID
HE WOULD WALK AWAY

02:04.392 --> 02:08.262
RATTLING OFF BASEBALL
STATISTICS OR SOMETHING.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.231
WHEN OUR DOG DIED,

02:10.331 --> 02:12.700
HE DIDN'T SEEM TO NOTICE.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.468
AND HE LOVED THAT DOG.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.371
BUT THEN, LIKE,
THREE MONTHS LATER

02:17.471 --> 02:19.440
HE TURNED INTO THE KID
FROM "THE EXORCIST"

02:19.540 --> 02:21.375
AND STARTED TELLING
EVERYONE HE MET

02:21.475 --> 02:23.377
THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO DIE.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.980
DID SHE TELL HIM BEFORE
OR AFTER THE TESTS CAME BACK?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.116
RIGHT AFTERWARDS.

02:29.217 --> 02:32.786
THEY CAME OVER.
MY MOTHER BROUGHT ME A CAKE

02:32.886 --> 02:36.457
AND DANIEL
GAVE ME THIS HAT.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.659
IT WAS LIKE
MY BIRTHDAY.

02:38.759 --> 02:42.230
SO ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.598
IT'S WORKING.

02:44.698 --> 02:48.168
THE MASS BEHIND MY SPINE
IS SHRINKING.

02:48.269 --> 02:52.206
SO THAT MEANS
THE PROGNOSIS IS GOOD.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.808
YES.
YEAH.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.011
WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

02:58.111 --> 03:02.149
I'M JUST SO RELIEVED.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.851
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

03:05.953 --> 03:07.955
I DON'T KNOW.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.723
YOU DON'T KNOW?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.559
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.094
YEAH, IT'S WEIRD.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.364
WHEN THEY FIRST TOLD YOU,
WERE YOU SURPRISED?

03:16.464 --> 03:18.399
DID YOU BELIEVE THEM?

03:18.499 --> 03:21.869
ARE YOU ALONE HERE?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.804
YES.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.906
BUT DON'T YOU
HAVE CHILDREN?

03:26.006 --> 03:28.075
YOU TOLD ME
YOU HAVE CHILDREN.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.678
I DO.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.313
WHERE ARE THEY?

03:32.413 --> 03:35.683
THEY LIVE
WITH THEIR MOTHER.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.719
SO YOU COULDN'T
MAKE IT WORK EITHER,

03:38.819 --> 03:41.021
AND YOU'RE A THERAPIST.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.324
MAYBE THIS IS WHY
THERAPISTS DON'T TALK

03:43.424 --> 03:45.593
ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL LIVES.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.031
KYLE AND SIENNA BROKE UP.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.900
WHEN?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.835
LAST WEEK, I GUESS.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.371
HE TOOK ME OUT TO DINNER

03:57.471 --> 04:00.941
AND HE GAVE ME
THIS NECKLACE.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.311
IT'S A WISHBONE
OR SOMETHING

04:03.411 --> 04:05.513
ON A SILK CHAIN,

04:05.613 --> 04:08.316
WHICH IS APPARENTLY
SUPPOSED TO BREAK.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.484
AND WHEN IT DOES,

04:10.584 --> 04:12.520
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
MAKE A WISH.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.055
WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO WISH FOR?

04:15.155 --> 04:19.327
WE WENT OUT FOR TWO YEARS
AND HE NEVER GAVE ME
ANY JEWELRY.

04:19.427 --> 04:24.432
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.967
I GUESS
HE FEELS GUILTY.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.202
THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.705
YOU'LL PROBABLY TELL ME
THAT HE CARES ABOUT ME

04:31.805 --> 04:33.907
AND HE'S TRYING
TO EXPRESS HIMSELF.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.944
THAT'S ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.116
IT'S TOO LATE.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.553
WHY?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.988
I'M GONE.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.359
YOU MEAN

04:51.459 --> 04:55.396
YOU'RE GONE BEYOND HIM
EMOTIONALLY.

04:55.496 --> 04:58.432
I MEAN
THE GIRL HE LOVED--

04:58.532 --> 05:03.203
THE GIRL HE THINKS
HE LOVES--

05:03.303 --> 05:05.005
SHE DOESN'T EXIST
ANYMORE.

05:05.105 --> 05:09.677
EVEN IF MY HAIR GROWS BACK
AND I GO INTO REMISSION,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.446
FROM NOW ON
ANYBODY THAT I MEET--

05:12.546 --> 05:14.448
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TELL THEM I HAD CANCER.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.283
WHY?

05:16.384 --> 05:17.785
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.152
SO ARE YOU SAYING

05:19.252 --> 05:21.722
THAT YOUR CANCER HAS ERASED
EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE,

05:21.822 --> 05:24.658
THAT YOUR OLD SELF
IS JUST GONE?

05:26.326 --> 05:30.631
I WAS SITTING ACROSS
THE TABLE FROM KYLE

05:30.731 --> 05:33.501
AND I KNEW I COULD
TAKE HIM HOME WITH ME

05:33.601 --> 05:35.869
EVEN NOW
WITH NO HAIR.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.607
I MISS HIM.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.243
BUT THE IDEA OF GETTING
INTO BED WITH HIM,

05:43.343 --> 05:44.645
TAKING MY CLOTHES OFF

05:44.745 --> 05:46.179
AND LETTING HIM
GET CLOSE TO ME,

05:46.279 --> 05:49.316
LETTING HIM--

05:49.417 --> 05:53.754
IT'S DISGUSTING.
I DON'T WANT IT EVER AGAIN.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.156
THAT'S JUST WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING NOW, APRIL.
THAT WILL CHANGE.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.791
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
DOESN'T WANT SEX?

05:57.891 --> 06:01.028
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?
I'M DEAD. I'M GONE.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.896
YOU'RE NOT GONE, APRIL.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.699
YOU ARE RECOVERING.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.801
AND YOU'VE ONLY GOT
ENOUGH STRENGTH

06:07.901 --> 06:10.504
FOR ONE THING RIGHT NOW,
AND THAT'S TO GET BETTER.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.873
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.510
WHAT?

06:16.610 --> 06:18.446
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
HEARD YOU SAY THAT BEFORE.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.483
CONSIDER IT
A PARTING GIFT.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.318
IS THAT YOUR WAY
OF REMINDING ME

06:25.419 --> 06:27.488
OF WHAT YOU SAID
IN YOUR MESSAGE,

06:27.588 --> 06:30.558
THAT YOU WANT THIS TO BE
YOUR LAST SESSION?

06:30.658 --> 06:33.861
YES.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.297
AND PLEASE DON'T TRY
TO CONVINCE ME TO STAY.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.567
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOUR RECOVERY

06:39.667 --> 06:42.903
TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE
THAT'S GOING ON.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.605
I DON'T WANT TO.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.074
OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO,
BUT ISN'T THAT YOUR PATTERN,
APRIL?

06:47.174 --> 06:49.443
- STOP IT.
- THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN
WORKING ON.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.178
YOU'RE PUSHING ME AWAY.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.380
JUST LET ME HELP YOU.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.382
- I CAN'T.
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.551
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS
I WANT TO SCHEDULE SOME MEETINGS

06:57.651 --> 06:59.319
FOR YOUR PARENTS,
BRING THEM INTO THERAPY.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.622
MAYBE WE COULD
BRING IN DANIEL--

07:01.722 --> 07:03.323
STOP IT.
I SAID NO.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.126
- YOUR MOTHER AND DANI--
- STOP IT, YOU FUCKING ASSHOL.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.881
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:29.583 --> 07:32.052
I HAD TO GO
SCRATCH MY HEAD.

07:35.523 --> 07:36.924
I'M SORRY.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.126
NO APOLOGIES.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.561
WHY DON'T I HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.329
IS IT BECAUSE
I'M SICK?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.364
BECAUSE I'M YOUR THERAPIST.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.834
SO WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
A HUMAN BEING?

07:46.934 --> 07:50.237
SOMEONE CALLS YOU
A FUCKING ASSHOLE
AND YOU DON'T CARE?

07:50.337 --> 07:52.205
I TOLD YOU THE DAY WE MET

07:52.305 --> 07:56.243
THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE
TAKING CARE OF MY FEELINGS.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.812
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THERAPY THEN,

07:58.912 --> 08:00.981
TEACHING PEOPLE TO BE
SELF-OBSESSED?

08:01.081 --> 08:04.251
DO YOU REALLY THINK I NEED
MORE HELP IN THAT DEPARTMENT?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.622
DO YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN?

08:27.608 --> 08:29.877
I UNDERSTAND
THAT MAYBE YOU REACTED

08:29.977 --> 08:32.746
BECAUSE A PART OF YOU
WANTS TO LEAVE,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.748
BUT MAYBE YOU REACTED
SO STRONGLY

08:34.848 --> 08:37.217
BECAUSE WHILE PART OF YOU
WANTS TO LEAVE,

08:37.317 --> 08:39.820
ANOTHER PART OF YOU REALIZES
THAT SOMETHING VALUABLE

08:39.920 --> 08:42.856
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING
IN THIS ROOM.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.426
I COULD BE
A PERFECT PERSON.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.197
I COULD REACH NIRVANA.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.733
AND I COULD WAKE UP TOMORROW
WITH A LUMP IN MY BREAST.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.969
SO YOU'RE SAYING,
WHAT IS THE POINT?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.671
YES.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.040
WHAT'S THE POINT?

09:01.575 --> 09:03.276
( grunting )

09:04.211 --> 09:06.714
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT OFF?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.685
I DON'T WANT TO.

09:11.785 --> 09:15.022
AND I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT WHY NOT,

09:15.122 --> 09:18.826
OR WHY DANIEL GAVE ME
THE WRONG HAT,

09:18.926 --> 09:22.996
OR WHY I CAN'T LET YOU
SEE ME BALD.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.199
- I UNDERSTAND.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.302
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.278
I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.014
WHEN?

09:41.114 --> 09:42.883
LAST WEEK.

09:44.551 --> 09:47.120
IS IT BECAUSE OF THE CHEMO?

09:47.220 --> 09:50.257
BUT YOU ARE ALMOST DONE.
DON'T YOU WANT TO GRADUATE?

09:51.725 --> 09:54.327
I'M NEVER GONNA GET A JOB
AS AN ARCHITECT ANYWAY.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.929
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.530
YOU SAW MY WORK.
IT'S SHIT.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.833
I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.502
IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.
I'M SO FAR BEHIND NOW,

10:02.602 --> 10:04.872
THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD CATCH UP.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.507
ACTUALLY YOU HAVEN'T MISSED
THAT MUCH TIME AT ALL.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.743
I'M SURE THE SCHOOL
WOULD WORK WITH YOU--

10:09.843 --> 10:12.479
I WASN'T EVEN GOING
FOR ME.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.214
I WAS GOING
FOR MY MOTHER.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.917
SHE GOT SO NERVOUS WHEN
I WAS GRADUATING COLLEGE

10:17.017 --> 10:20.187
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
HAVE A PLAN.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.724
SHE WANTED ME TO GET
INTO AN ADVANCED DEGREE

10:23.824 --> 10:25.726
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT ME

10:25.826 --> 10:29.229
BECAUSE I WAS
ON A PATH TO SUCCESS.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.964
SHE USED TO SAY,

10:31.064 --> 10:35.736
"A MOTHER IS ONLY AS HAPPY
AS HER LEAST HAPPY CHILD."

10:35.836 --> 10:39.239
AND THEN SHE'D LOOK OVER
AT DANIEL AND SIGH.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.075
AND I WOULD THINK,

10:42.175 --> 10:45.045
"YOU'RE STARING
AT THE WRONG KID, LADY."

10:45.645 --> 10:47.047
WELL...

10:53.620 --> 10:56.156
OKAY, LET'S SAY

10:56.256 --> 10:57.991
THAT YOU DO WANT
TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.427
WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST
TAKE A LEAVE OF ABSENCE?

11:00.527 --> 11:03.596
I WON'T GO BACK.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.766
SO YOU'RE NOT JUST
CUTTING TIES WITH ME.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.201
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CUTTING TIES
WITH EVERYTHING.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.171
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO,

11:11.271 --> 11:13.707
GO SIT IN A CLASSROOM,
SUCK UP TO MY TEACHERS,

11:13.807 --> 11:16.276
SNORT RITALIN
WITH MY FRIENDS?

11:16.376 --> 11:17.745
REALLY?

11:17.845 --> 11:19.512
I HAVE CANCER.

11:19.612 --> 11:22.916
I'M 23
AND I HAVE CANCER.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.653
HOW THE FUCK AM I
SUPPOSED TO TOP THAT?

11:26.754 --> 11:30.157
WHERE THE HELL
DO I GO FROM HERE?

11:30.257 --> 11:32.459
APRIL, IF YOU COULD GO
ANYWHERE YOU WANTED,

11:32.559 --> 11:34.962
ANYWHERE AT ALL,
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.202
BACK.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.303
YOU MEAN HOME?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.805
YEAH.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.042
BUT ISN'T YOUR HOME

11:49.142 --> 11:51.812
"SO LONG AGO
AND SO FAR AWAY"?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.915
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

11:59.953 --> 12:03.824
THERE ARE THESE ORGANIC FARMS
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.460
AND THEY GIVE YOU FREE ROOM
AND BOARD FOR YOUR LABOR.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.364
I WAS THINKING ABOUT JUST
GOING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.066
FOR HOW LONG?

12:13.166 --> 12:16.036
I DON'T KNOW.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.840
UNTIL I FORGET
MY OWN NAME.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.077
WELL, UNLESS YOU
DEVELOP AMNESIA,

12:24.177 --> 12:25.846
THE CHANCES
OF THAT HAPPENING

12:25.946 --> 12:29.149
ARE SLIM TO NONE.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.885
THERE WAS A GIRL
IN CHEMO WITH ME.

12:31.985 --> 12:35.255
SHE WAS ABOUT MY AGE.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.224
HER NAME WAS LYRIC--

12:37.324 --> 12:39.026
LYRIC MERRIMAN.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.595
IT WAS SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.598
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT?

12:45.698 --> 12:49.136
NO.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.004
SHE DIED.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.941
SORRY.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.543
THE LAST TIME I SAW HER,
WE WERE SITTING
SIDE BY SIDE,

12:56.643 --> 12:58.745
ATTACHED TO OUR DRIPS.

12:58.846 --> 13:02.582
IT LOOKED LIKE SHE WAS
DOODLING IN HER NOTEBOOK,

13:02.682 --> 13:04.184
JUST DOODLING.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.720
AND SO I LEANED OVER
TO LOOK AT IT.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.189
AND...

13:14.895 --> 13:17.330
SHE WAS WRITING
HER NAME

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
OVER AND OVER

13:21.201 --> 13:23.370
IN ALL DIFFERENT SCRIPTS,

13:24.471 --> 13:27.040
JUST HER NAME.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.010
MAYBE SHE WAS AFRAID
OF BEING FORGOTTEN.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.415
IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE
THE ONE WHO SURVIVES.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.587
I DON'T WANT TO.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.355
SURVIVE?

13:44.691 --> 13:49.596
IT JUST SEEMS SO HARD.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.332
LIVING?

13:53.934 --> 13:57.570
DID LIVING SEEM HARD
BEFORE YOU GOT SICK?

13:58.471 --> 14:00.073
NO.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.577
THERE USED TO BE
THIS PATH.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.681
AND IT WAS LIKE--

14:08.781 --> 14:10.583
IT WAS STEEP.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.252
IT WAS TIRING,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.788
BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW,
WELL LIT.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.790
AND IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE.

14:17.891 --> 14:22.062
IT'S COMPLETELY GONE.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.531
DID I JUST
MAKE IT ALL UP?

14:24.631 --> 14:28.101
NO, YOU JUST GOT REROUTED.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.371
YOUR LIFE'S PATH
HAS CHANGED

14:32.472 --> 14:34.441
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.

14:36.977 --> 14:40.380
IT MUST BE
SO HARD TO HANDLE.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.885
APRIL, WHAT YOU'RE
FEELING IS NORMAL.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.888
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

14:48.989 --> 14:52.692
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO
GROW OLDER.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.227
YOU'RE GOING TO
FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.030
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
CHILDREN IF YOU WANT TO.

14:57.130 --> 15:00.400
YOU WILL HAVE ADVENTURES.
YOU WILL KNOW SUCH JOY.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.470
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.238
NO NO, OF COURSE WE DON'T.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.542
BUT SOMETIMES WE JUST HAVE
TO ACT AS IF WE DO.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.245
THAT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.314
LOOK, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
THE WORST OF IT.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.549
YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED
TO CLIMB OUT OF THE HOLE.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.351
YOU CAN'T SEE THAT YET.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.529
ARE YOU OKAY?

15:47.180 --> 15:49.983
I THINK I'M GOING TO BE
ALONE MY WHOLE LIFE.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.685
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.887
IT'S JUST A FEELING I HAVE,

15:54.988 --> 15:56.889
LIKE A PREMONITION.

15:56.990 --> 16:01.194
I CAN'T IMAGINE
LOVING ANYONE EVER AGAIN.

16:01.294 --> 16:06.799
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I DID IT ONCE.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.801
IT LOOKS EXHAUSTING.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.072
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.008
I HAVE CANCER.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.110
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

16:17.210 --> 16:20.547
I'M NO LONGER 23.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.623
I WENT ON YOUR PAGE
AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.159
MY WHAT?

16:32.259 --> 16:35.495
YOUR PAGE--
YOU KNOW, ONLINE,

16:35.595 --> 16:38.231
WHERE PEOPLE CAN COMMENT
ON YOU AS A THERAPIST.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.901
YES, MY SAD,
EMPTY LITTLE WEB DOMAIN.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.971
EXCEPT IT'S NOT
EMPTY ANYMORE.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.841
SOMEONE WROTE A COMMENT--
SOMEONE NAMED SOPHIE.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.044
WAS SHE A PATIENT
OF YOURS?

16:53.113 --> 16:57.850
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T DISCUSS
MY OTHER PATIENTS.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.552
NOT EVEN WITH ME?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.254
NO.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.260
SHE SAYS
YOU SAVED HER LIFE.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.065
YOU SHOULD GO LOOK
AT THE PAGE.

17:12.165 --> 17:16.869
SHE HAS A LOT OF NICE THINGS
TO SAY ABOUT YOU.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.739
SHE'S IN COLLEGE.
SHE SOUNDS HAPPY.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.475
WELL, I WILL.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.145
THANK YOU.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.580
THANKS FOR TELLING ME.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.956
YOU'VE REALLY HELPED ME.

17:37.056 --> 17:40.860
APRIL, I REALLY
DIDN'T DO THAT MUCH.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.331
I TOOK YOU TO CHEMO.
I TOLD YOUR MOTHER.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.167
THE REST YOU DID YOURSELF.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.169
- LET ME THANK YOU.
- YEAH, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT

17:49.269 --> 17:52.839
THAT YOU SEE HOW YOU TOOK
RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF

17:52.939 --> 17:54.574
BY COMING TO SEE ME.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.809
LET ME THANK YOU.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.180
AND THEN LET ME LEAVE.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.151
ARE YOU SURE?

18:04.251 --> 18:07.120
I MEAN, WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED

18:07.220 --> 18:10.089
SO MUCH IN THIS ROOM.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.058
YOU'RE NOT THE SAME PERSON

18:12.159 --> 18:13.793
WHO CAME IN HERE
TWO MONTHS AGO.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.497
I CAME IN WITH CANCER.
I'M LEAVING WITH CANCER.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.332
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT, APRIL.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.702
YOU WERE SO ANGRY
WHEN YOU GOT HERE.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.171
I'M STILL ANGRY.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.072
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT NOW
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.507
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,

18:27.607 --> 18:30.343
YOU COULDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT ANYTHING WOULD HURT YOU.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.745
NOW EVERYTHING HURTS ME.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.914
THE RAIN HURTS ME.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.849
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
NO SKIN.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.653
WELL, THERAPEUTICALLY,

18:40.753 --> 18:43.756
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.761
I MEAN, YOU'VE LEARNED
SO MUCH ABOUT YOURSELF--

18:48.861 --> 18:50.697
ABOUT TRUST AND ACCEPTANCE,

18:50.797 --> 18:53.533
ABOUT NOT NEEDING
TO BE PERFECT ALL THE TIME.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.735
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S HARD
TO SEE THAT NOW,

18:55.835 --> 18:58.238
BUT THE GREAT THING
ABOUT SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS

18:58.338 --> 19:01.308
THAT ONCE YOU HAVE IT,
YOU HAVE IT.

19:01.408 --> 19:05.578
AND YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT PUT IT INTO USE.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.448
OKAY.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.683
YOU STILL HAVE CHALLENGES
AHEAD OF YOU.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.687
THAT'S WHY I THINK
YOU REALLY NEED TO KEEP
TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.023
MAYBE, BUT NOT YOU.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.592
IT CAN'T BE YOU.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.994
'CAUSE I'M THE GUY
WHO TOOK YOU TO CHEMO?

19:22.094 --> 19:24.731
YOU'RE THE GUY
WHO SAVED MY LIFE.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.005
DO YOU WANT ME TO REFER YOU
TO ANOTHER THERAPIST?

19:33.105 --> 19:36.075
MAYBE LATER.
NOT NOW.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.812
RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT
TO BREATHE

19:39.912 --> 19:41.381
AND GET WELL.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.217
I'M SO GLAD
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

19:44.317 --> 19:48.388
PEOPLE DO SURVIVE
WITHOUT THERAPY.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.258
IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME
TO HEAR THAT,

19:53.025 --> 19:54.727
BUT I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
CAN YOU HOLD ON
FOR A SECOND?

20:19.752 --> 20:24.657
THIS MIGHT BE EASIER
ON YOUR HEAD.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.093
IT'S MADE OF LEATHER.

20:27.193 --> 20:28.961
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.464
IT WAS MY FATHER'S.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.032
THEN YOU SHOULD KEEP IT.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.335
NO, IT'S FOR YOU.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.903
ARE YOU SURE?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.439
MM-HMM.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.610
CAN I TRY IT ON?

20:43.710 --> 20:44.877
SURE.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.591
OKAY.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.832
WOW.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.571
MY MOM'S GONNA
LOVE THIS.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.807
SHE REALLY ROCKS THE WHOLE
AMELIA EARHART LOOK.

21:14.907 --> 21:18.611
SILK SCARVES
AND LEATHER JACKETS
ARE KIND OF HER THING.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.813
I THOUGHT CUBA WAS
HER THING.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.649
SHE'S COMPLICATED.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.120
NOT EVERYTHING'S
BLACK-AND-WHITE, PAUL.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.989
I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.932
THANK YOU.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.948
GOODBYE.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.584
GOODBYE.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.008
( music playing )
