01:10.817 --> 01:14.514
<i>Me? I was eight when I discovered
my purpose in life.</i>

01:14.621 --> 01:18.921
<i>I was at the St. Thomas Church next to the
Hyatt Regency in Weehawken, New Jersey.</i>

01:19.025 --> 01:21.391
<i>It was my cousin Lisa's
wedding.</i>

01:21.495 --> 01:24.692
Here, Dad. Let me.

01:24.798 --> 01:27.596
<i>It was our first big
family event since Mom died...</i>

01:27.701 --> 01:30.693
<i>and Dad was not in great shape.</i>

01:30.804 --> 01:34.240

Uh, come on, Tess.
Let's go.

01:49.489 --> 01:53.448
Shit! Oh, shit!

<i>- Oh,Janey, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. We have cable.</i>

02:00.534 --> 02:02.968
What'll I do?
What the f--

02:03.069 --> 02:05.799
The heck am I gonna do?

02:11.111 --> 02:15.480
Thank you so much, sweetie.
You saved the day.

02:15.582 --> 02:19.109
Janey, get my train.

02:21.922 --> 02:26.052
<i>And that was the moment.
That's when I fell in love with weddings.</i>

02:26.159 --> 02:29.151
<i>I knew that I had helped someone
on the most important day of their life.</i>

02:29.262 --> 02:33.665
<i>And I couldn't wait
for my own special day.</i>

02:33.767 --> 02:38.500
<i>Oh,Jane, that's stunning.
It really is. It's the perfect dress.</i>

02:38.605 --> 02:41.540
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.

02:41.641 --> 02:45.236
Really? You really think so?

02:45.345 --> 02:48.007
It's amazing,
like it was made for you.

02:48.114 --> 02:51.447
- It's for you. It's the bride.
- Oh, great.

02:51.551 --> 02:53.451
Thank you. Hi, Suzanne.

02:53.553 --> 02:55.714
-Jane, is it ready?
- Yeah. They just finished hemming it.

02:55.822 --> 02:57.790
- It fits?
- I know. Thank God we're the same size.

02:57.891 --> 03:00.291
- Are you coming now?
- I'm gonna have it over to you in just a minute.

03:00.393 --> 03:02.793
- Don't worry about anything. This is your day.
- Thanks,Jane.

03:12.372 --> 03:15.170
Come on.
Get that out of here.

03:19.179 --> 03:21.147
There you are! You look great.

03:21.248 --> 03:23.239
- Thanks!
- Okay. Let's go. Come on.

03:23.350 --> 03:27.309
Oh. Here.

03:27.420 --> 03:30.287
- What's this?
- I brought you a shawl, Visine, Tylenol...

03:30.390 --> 03:32.381
- a pair of my earrings.
- Ooh.

03:32.492 --> 03:36.724
- About your hair--
- What? The bitch said, "Up." It's up.

03:36.830 --> 03:38.991
Okay. I'll fix it
inside.

03:39.099 --> 03:41.158
What's all this stuff?

03:41.268 --> 03:43.930
Let's just hurry.

03:44.037 --> 03:47.165
Aren't the dresses great?
The best thing about them is...

03:47.274 --> 03:50.175
-you can shorten them and wear them again.
- Definitely. So true.

03:50.277 --> 03:52.711
Give me a smile.

03:52.812 --> 03:56.111
<i>Okay. Excuse me.
On the right-</i>

03:56.216 --> 03:59.413
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union...

03:59.519 --> 04:02.010
<i>of Suzanne and Greg.</i>

04:02.122 --> 04:03.953
<i>This is a time
of great joy...</i>

04:04.057 --> 04:06.582
<i>as we honor two people
who have come together...</i>

04:06.693 --> 04:08.854
<i>to be joined
in holy matrimony.</i>

04:08.962 --> 04:11.931
- Oh, wow.
- Sorry.

04:12.032 --> 04:15.468
Taxi!

04:15.569 --> 04:18.902
Great.

04:19.005 --> 04:22.463
Thanks. 31 Water Street.
Brooklyn.

04:22.576 --> 04:25.443
<i>Okay. I will give you
$300 flat...</i>

04:25.545 --> 04:27.513
- for the whole night on one condition--
- Yeah.

04:27.614 --> 04:29.809
You don't look in the rear view mirror
or I deduct.

04:29.916 --> 04:31.884
- Deal? Great.
- Yeah.

04:37.023 --> 04:38.923
What are you doing?

04:39.025 --> 04:41.152
Hey. You just cost yourself
20 bucks.

04:41.261 --> 04:44.628
I-- No one's looking.

04:50.403 --> 04:52.997
I'll be right back.

04:56.109 --> 04:59.078
<i>Thank God you're here. I'm freakin' out.</i>

04:59.179 --> 05:01.306
- I forgot my thingy.
- Oh! Um--

05:01.414 --> 05:04.349
I brought extra.
No worries.

05:05.385 --> 05:07.285
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

05:07.387 --> 05:09.446
- Hi!
- Hi!

05:09.556 --> 05:13.788
Are these dresses great? And the best thing
is you could shorten it and wear it again.

05:13.893 --> 05:15.793
That is definitely so true.

05:15.895 --> 05:20.059
<i>We gather here today
to join in holy matrimony...</i>

05:20.166 --> 05:24.364
- Shari Rabinowitz--
- And Prakash Maharasti...

05:24.471 --> 05:26.837
known to his friends
as "Woody."

05:26.940 --> 05:32.879
<i>Shari and Prakash are so happy
that so many of you are here today-</i>

05:32.979 --> 05:35.812
What are you doing?
Get in the car! Come on!

05:35.915 --> 05:37.883
Go! Go! Go!

05:37.984 --> 05:39.679
- You in?
- Yeah.

05:45.925 --> 05:49.884
Hey! Hey!
You are down to 260.

05:49.996 --> 05:52.487
Are you sure you wanna
keep this up?

05:52.599 --> 05:55.193
- No!
- Okay, then.

05:57.337 --> 05:59.532
Okay. Which one do you want?
The brunet or the blond?

05:59.639 --> 06:01.630
<i>I kinda want the blond.
I'm not gonna lie.</i>

06:01.741 --> 06:03.800
Casey, can't you keep it
in your pants for one wedding?

06:03.910 --> 06:06.538
Are you kidding? The only reason to wear
this monstrous dress...

06:06.646 --> 06:10.343
is so some drunken groomsman
can rip it to shreds with his teeth.

06:10.450 --> 06:15.478
What time is it now? Well, I'm just gonna be
about two more hours, so--

06:15.588 --> 06:17.647
I'll call you back.

06:24.197 --> 06:26.165
Holy--

06:28.034 --> 06:30.025
Whoo!

06:30.136 --> 06:31.763
Whoo!

06:34.274 --> 06:38.074
Whoo! Whoo!

06:42.282 --> 06:46.378
<i>#Lovely is the feeling now #</i>

06:46.486 --> 06:50.183
Hey! Wrong shoes!
Wait a minute. Wrong shoes.

06:50.290 --> 06:52.349
Ziggy! What?

06:54.360 --> 06:56.419
<i># Temperature's rising now #</i>

06:56.529 --> 07:00.363
<i>- Ha!
- #Power #</i>

07:00.467 --> 07:02.731
Oh! Geez!

07:02.836 --> 07:05.703
<i>Jane, I'm so hungry. Did you eat anything?</i>

07:05.805 --> 07:07.864
- Oh, yeah.
- It looks gorgeous. I haven't eaten anything.

07:07.974 --> 07:10.966
And let me give you some advice,
do not drink Moet on an empty stomach.

07:11.077 --> 07:12.977
<i>I'll tell ya. Whoa. Fall right off.</i>

07:18.118 --> 07:21.417
- Did you meet my grandma?
- Yeah. She was great. I really enjoyed her.

07:21.521 --> 07:23.614
- I think she's having fun.
- Oh, yeah. Lots.

07:23.723 --> 07:26.453
<i>#Don't stop
till you get enough #</i>

07:26.559 --> 07:29.289
<i>- #Keep on with the force #
- Whoo-hoo!</i>

07:29.395 --> 07:32.455
<i>- #Don't stop till you get enough #
- #Keep on, baby #</i>

07:32.565 --> 07:36.797
<i>#Don't stop till you get enough ##</i>

07:36.903 --> 07:40.737
-Jane, what is that thing on your forehead?
- Oh.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.331
I'd like to take a moment
to give a special thank-you to a girl...

07:43.443 --> 07:46.139
<i>who's really gone
above and beyond.</i>

07:46.246 --> 07:49.909
The girl who not only hosted my shower
and helped me design the invitation--

07:50.016 --> 07:54.146
<i>She went with me to the caterer,
the florist, the wedding cake bakery-</i>

07:54.254 --> 07:57.712
And to eight bridal stores...

07:57.824 --> 08:00.190
where she helped me cling
to my self-esteem--

08:00.293 --> 08:02.352
As I tried on dress
after dress.

08:02.462 --> 08:04.930
So thanks,Jane!

08:06.432 --> 08:09.697
Thanks,Jane.

08:09.803 --> 08:12.499
Okay! Everybody ready?

08:31.224 --> 08:35.024
Is she all right?

08:37.563 --> 08:39.554
Is she all right?

08:42.335 --> 08:44.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.Just take it easy.

08:45.004 --> 08:47.564
You don't wanna move around too much.
Okay. This is a serious injury.

08:47.674 --> 08:50.905
I need you to give me some ice.
You, give me a bottle of 100-proof liquor...

08:51.010 --> 08:52.841
and something
she can bite on-- stat!

08:52.946 --> 08:56.382
All right. She's fine,
folks.

08:56.482 --> 08:58.848
Just a little bump
on the head. Carry on.

08:58.952 --> 09:01.011
You a doctor?

09:01.120 --> 09:04.578
No, but Tweedledee and "Tweedledrunk"
were bugging me, so--

09:04.691 --> 09:07.421
- Okay. Do you know your name?
-Jane.

09:07.527 --> 09:09.722
Jane. I'm Kevin.

09:09.829 --> 09:13.196
Hmm. Thank you
for helping me.

09:13.299 --> 09:15.199
- Sure. Got it?
- Uh-huh.

09:15.301 --> 09:17.201
- Okay. You're good?
- I'm fine.

09:17.303 --> 09:20.795
All right.

09:20.907 --> 09:24.399
Whoa, whoa. Okay.
Why don't we get you a cab?

09:24.510 --> 09:27.377
All right. Nice and easy.
Let's walk.

09:27.480 --> 09:31.314
<i># That I'm irresponsibly mad #</i>

09:31.417 --> 09:33.647
<i>#For you ##</i>

09:38.658 --> 09:41.593
I loved your thong,
by the way.

09:41.694 --> 09:44.356
You buzzed past me earlier.
I saw you changing gowns.

09:44.464 --> 09:46.864
<i>You were in two weddings
in one night, weren't you?</i>

09:46.966 --> 09:50.527
- That's a little upsetting, don't you think?
- They're both good friends...

09:50.637 --> 09:54.073
and their weddings happened to be on
the same night, so what was I supposed to do?

09:54.173 --> 09:56.607
Oh, no. That's not the upsetting part.
How do you stand it?

09:56.709 --> 09:59.200
- I mean, isn't one wedding bad enough?
- I love weddings. I always have.

09:59.312 --> 10:00.802
<i>- Really?
- Yeah.</i>

10:00.914 --> 10:04.145
Which part, the forced merriment,
horrible music or bad food?

10:04.250 --> 10:07.549
Actually, it's meeting
upbeat people like yourself.

10:07.654 --> 10:11.784
Love is patient. Love is kind.
Love means slowly losing your mind.

10:11.891 --> 10:13.859
- What is it you do again?
- I'm a writer.

10:13.960 --> 10:15.860
Right.

10:18.331 --> 10:20.822
<i>- This is my building.
- I got it.</i>

10:20.934 --> 10:22.834
- No. I got it.
- Sure?

10:22.936 --> 10:25.097
Yeah.

10:25.204 --> 10:28.571
All right, sweetie. A hundred and forty.
You know what you did.

10:28.675 --> 10:31.439
Hey! What's-- No.
He's gonna be right back. Hold on.

10:31.544 --> 10:34.570
Don't you think it's a whole lot of ritual
for something that--

10:34.681 --> 10:37.844
Let's face it-- It's got about a 50-50 shot
of making it out of the gate.

10:37.951 --> 10:40.078
How very refreshing.
A man who doesn't believe in marriage.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.654
- I'm just trying to point out
the hypocrisy of the spectacle.
- Oh.

10:42.755 --> 10:44.746
That's so noble of you.
Do you also go around...

10:44.857 --> 10:46.757
telling small children
that Santa Claus doesn't exist?

10:46.859 --> 10:48.759
'Cause someone needs
to blow that shit wide open.

10:48.861 --> 10:52.297
So you admit that believing in marriage
is kind of like believing in Santa Claus.

10:52.398 --> 10:54.628
No. I--

10:56.035 --> 10:58.902
I don't know why I'm arguing
this with a perfect stranger.

10:59.005 --> 11:01.769
But, yes, marriage, like everything good
and important, isn't easy.

11:01.874 --> 11:04.604
Cynicism, on the other hand,
always is.

11:04.711 --> 11:07.475
- It was very interesting meeting you.
- Bye.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.810
Yeah.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.941
You gonna be in more
weddings next weekend?

11:12.051 --> 11:14.383
<i>- I have to go.
- How many have you been in, by the way?</i>

11:14.487 --> 11:17.320
<i>- Just, like, ballpark.
- Good night.</i>

11:25.331 --> 11:28.129
<i>- Hey, you know what? Could you--
- Yeah?</i>

11:28.234 --> 11:31.032
<i>- Forget it.
- Yup.</i>

12:14.514 --> 12:17.574
Okay.

12:24.357 --> 12:28.885
Death. Destruction.
Wedding vows. Yea.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.021
Come to mama.

12:37.136 --> 12:39.263
Oh.

12:54.620 --> 12:57.418
<i>Jeter hit a walk-off
in the ninth. Did you see it?</i>

12:57.523 --> 12:59.548
Uh, no. I work
Saturday nights, remember?

12:59.659 --> 13:02.628
- Here. From the happy couple.
- Oh, that's right.

13:02.728 --> 13:07.028
You were eating coconut cake
and doing the Electric Slide.

13:07.133 --> 13:09.124
- So how'd it go?
- Oh, let's see.

13:09.235 --> 13:11.726
The bride wore a gown that sparkled
like the groom's eyes...

13:11.838 --> 13:15.137
as he saw her approaching
through a shower of rose petals.

13:15.241 --> 13:17.471
And you're not
getting laid?

13:17.577 --> 13:19.841
Commitments is the gold standard
of wedding announcements.

13:19.946 --> 13:22.710
Every girl on the planet rips open that page,
first thing Sunday.

13:22.815 --> 13:25.010
Brides kill to get in there.

13:25.118 --> 13:28.144
Do you have any idea
what you can be doin'?

13:28.254 --> 13:30.449
- You mean to women who are
about to get married?
- Yeah.

13:30.556 --> 13:32.456
They won't call you.
They won't bother you.

13:32.558 --> 13:35.459
They will pretend they never even met you.
You can't beat that.

13:35.561 --> 13:37.825
Well, it's not gonna
matter much longer anyway.

13:37.930 --> 13:41.297
- You're looking at my ticket
out of the taffeta ghetto.
- Keep on dreaming.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.427
- Uh, go away.
- Yes. Okay.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.673
What? I wasn't gonna come
to work in my bridesmaid dress.

13:53.779 --> 13:56.043
Two-day walk of shame outfit.
Elegant.

13:58.818 --> 14:01.048
What happened to you
the other night?

14:01.154 --> 14:03.782
You were barely there,
and then you disappeared.

14:03.890 --> 14:06.620
- You meet someone?
- Come on. No.

14:06.726 --> 14:08.694
Oh. Ridiculous question.

14:11.063 --> 14:13.031
- Good morning, Gina.
- Hi.

14:13.132 --> 14:16.829
- You haven't seen my Filofax
anywhere, have you?
- No.

14:16.936 --> 14:18.961
No. Okay.
I'll go look for it.

14:19.071 --> 14:22.905
- Did you get those catalog pages in for George?
- No.

14:23.009 --> 14:25.534
Okay. No worries.
I'll get them from production.

14:26.913 --> 14:28.813
Attagirl.
Show her who's boss.

14:28.915 --> 14:31.349
- I'm not her boss.
- You're the boss's assistant.

14:31.450 --> 14:34.419
Same diff. What's the good of your job
if you can't abuse the power?

14:34.520 --> 14:36.511
- Casey, go to Accounting.
- Now you're bossy.

14:42.728 --> 14:45.322
Where the hell
did I put that thing?

14:45.431 --> 14:48.229
That is a great idea for the front page
of the section.

14:48.334 --> 14:50.859
Oh, come on, Doyle. How many times
have I heard this from you?

14:50.970 --> 14:52.938
<i>- I'm telling you, Maureen. It's a great idea.
- Really?</i>

14:53.039 --> 14:57.373
As great as your last great idea, an expose
on price-fixing at wedding bakeries?

14:57.476 --> 15:00.172
Yes! Yes! They're ripping people off.
Flour costs pennies per ounce.

15:00.279 --> 15:02.645
That's an 8000/0 markup.
It's outrageous.

15:02.748 --> 15:04.909
Yes, it is.
Also, no one cares.

15:05.017 --> 15:08.111
What about the piece I wanted to do on
the exploitation of workers in lace factories?

15:08.221 --> 15:10.121
- That is a killer piece.
- Oh, right.

15:10.223 --> 15:12.691
That's what people really wanna
read about in the Style section.

15:12.792 --> 15:16.853
<i>Kevin, this section practically
pays for the entire paper.</i>

15:16.963 --> 15:20.228
Our advertisers want fun, upbeat,
colorful human-interest stories...

15:20.333 --> 15:23.131
- opposite their products.
- So that's what we're about now? Making money?

15:23.236 --> 15:25.966
- Get out.
- All right. Listen. That was not right.

15:26.072 --> 15:28.131
I get it. But this one is.
Look, this woman...

15:28.241 --> 15:30.334
- has been in seven weddings--
- So?

15:30.443 --> 15:34.209
This year. She was in two
on Saturday alone.

15:34.313 --> 15:36.474
But it won't just be about her.

15:36.582 --> 15:39.608
<i>It'll be an incisive look at how the wedding
industry has transformed something...</i>

15:39.719 --> 15:43.985
that should be an important rite
of passage into nothing more
than a corporate revenue stream.

15:45.858 --> 15:49.259
In a fun, upbeat, you know,
cheerful way.

15:49.362 --> 15:51.887
Look, Maureen, I am dying
back there in Commitments.

15:51.998 --> 15:55.092
If I have to write another sentence about
baby's breath, I'm gonna shoot myself.

15:55.201 --> 15:57.169
This is a real story.
This is what I wanna do.

15:57.270 --> 15:59.932
I need you covering weddings.
That's what you're good at.

16:00.039 --> 16:02.007
And that's what
I need you to do.

16:02.108 --> 16:04.736
If you don't start giving me feature stories,
I'm gonna have to quit.

16:04.844 --> 16:09.281
One chance. If I don't like it, you go back
to Commitments for the rest of your life...

16:09.382 --> 16:12.146
with a big smile on that ridiculously
handsome face of yours.

16:12.251 --> 16:15.084
Deal.

16:16.188 --> 16:18.986
- You think he'll like these?
- Yes, I do.

16:19.091 --> 16:23.084
<i>I think those photos for the fall catalog will
cause George to take you into his office...</i>

16:23.195 --> 16:27.029
- and make sweet love to you for hours and hours.
- Shh! Casey.

16:27.133 --> 16:30.830
Tell me that crazy crush is the reason you
work as hard as you do, 'cause it's upsetting.

16:30.936 --> 16:34.064
-Just like my job. Okay?
- No. You just think that one day...

16:34.173 --> 16:37.506
George is gonna wake up and realize
that he is madly in love with you...

16:37.610 --> 16:40.374
- and he's gonna make some
spectacular gesture of love--
- Flowers for Jane Nichols.

16:40.479 --> 16:43.039
Yeah. That's me.
Thank you.

16:44.717 --> 16:48.153
That's great. I spent two days in bed
with a guy, and you get flowers.

16:48.254 --> 16:50.313
- Nice.
- There's no note.

16:52.158 --> 16:55.650
Oh,Jane. You don't seriously think
they're from your dream guy, do you?

16:55.761 --> 16:58.855
Gina, can you take these
to my desk for me?

16:58.964 --> 17:00.329
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.731
Would you please stop
saying that? Nobody knows.

17:02.835 --> 17:04.859
Everybody knows,Jane,
except George.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.404
It's true.

17:07.506 --> 17:11.875
Gatsby! Hi, buddy. Hi!

17:11.977 --> 17:14.844
Whoa! Come on, Gatsby.
No slobbering on the ladies.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.040
Hi.

17:18.483 --> 17:22.420
- How was it?
- It was phenomenal. Up and back...

17:22.521 --> 17:24.785
in 10 hours--
our best time yet.

17:24.890 --> 17:26.915
Isn't that, like, the eighth time
you climbed Mount Whitney?

17:27.026 --> 17:30.154
- How do you remember that stuff,Jane?
- I don't know.

17:30.262 --> 17:33.754
- So we just got these in. What do you think?
- I think they're too corporate.

17:33.866 --> 17:36.494
<i>That's what I was thinking. They don't
have enough of a feel of being-</i>

17:36.602 --> 17:38.832
Outdoors. Right. I mean,
there's no adventure.

17:38.938 --> 17:41.429
There's no danger. Plus, everyone
looks way too put together.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.770
Yeah. Like models. Got it.
I will talk to Marketing.

17:43.876 --> 17:45.776
See? That's why I keep
you around,Jane.

17:45.878 --> 17:48.176
I mean, who else could finish my sentences?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.180
Your design meeting
is at 11:00.

17:50.282 --> 17:53.251
And the 92nd Street Y called to confirm
that you'll be attending their benefit.

17:53.352 --> 17:55.320
- You wanna go?
- Do I have to make a speech?

17:55.421 --> 17:58.549
Just a few words about ecologically
responsible business practices.

17:58.657 --> 18:00.625
Something light and fun.
You in?

18:00.726 --> 18:02.717
Yeah. Yeah, let's do it.
Put it on the calendar...

18:02.828 --> 18:05.126
but I'm probably gonna need
to dig up a date for that, huh?

18:05.231 --> 18:07.927
- Yeah. Probably.
- At least that's the one thing in my life...

18:08.033 --> 18:10.934
-you don't have to take care of for me, right?
- Yeah.

18:13.539 --> 18:16.201
Oh, my... God!

18:16.308 --> 18:18.367
<i>- Leave me alone.
- Jane!</i>

18:18.477 --> 18:21.378
- Yeah?
- Did you put that breakfast burrito on my desk?

18:21.480 --> 18:23.380
I just thought
you might be hungry.

18:23.482 --> 18:25.575
That's why I love ya.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.650
I love you too.

18:29.755 --> 18:32.952
Oh! Yeah.

18:33.058 --> 18:35.083
Yeah. You're right.
I needed that.

18:39.064 --> 18:41.965
<i>Okay, everybody. I hope to see you all
at my engagement party tonight.</i>

18:42.067 --> 18:45.127
<i>And,Jane, thanks again
for arranging everything.</i>

18:45.237 --> 18:47.467
No problem.

18:48.841 --> 18:52.140
Do you wanna come over
to my place before the party?

18:52.244 --> 18:54.212
Some of the guys from Shipping
are coming...

18:54.313 --> 18:57.180
- and they're bringing tequila and bubble wrap.
- Fun!

18:57.283 --> 18:59.478
I can't. I gotta pick up
Tess from the airport.

18:59.585 --> 19:04.022
God! Wouldn't it be great if there was
a service that you could hire to do that?

19:04.123 --> 19:08.150
Like yellow cars or shiny
black sedans--

19:08.260 --> 19:10.251
I want to pick her up.
She's my baby sister.

19:10.362 --> 19:12.330
Plus, she needs
my help, so--

19:12.431 --> 19:16.959
- See ya.
- Wouldn't wanna be ya.

19:26.045 --> 19:28.275
Hi!

19:28.380 --> 19:31.816
Yea!

19:31.917 --> 19:33.976
Hey! When did you start
traveling so lightly?

19:34.086 --> 19:36.850
Oh.

19:36.956 --> 19:38.890
I always meet the nicest
people on planes.

19:38.991 --> 19:41.892
Hmm. Come on.
Parked in P-9.

19:45.164 --> 19:48.190
Rudolfo said he wanted to come back
to New York with me, of course...

19:48.300 --> 19:50.325
but I told him that
I needed space, you know?

19:50.436 --> 19:53.428
<i>Spazio, Rudolfo!
Spazio.</i>

19:53.539 --> 19:57.771
Oh! This is so tiny
and cute. I love it.

20:00.212 --> 20:02.271
Ah. Feels so good
to be home.

20:02.381 --> 20:04.576
Six months away
feels like forever.

20:08.487 --> 20:10.955
<i>Mom was my age,you know?</i>

20:11.056 --> 20:14.548
<i>- Almost to the day.
- Yeah.</i>

20:14.660 --> 20:16.628
It was the perfect wedding--

20:16.729 --> 20:20.631
The Boathouse, the big band,
ceremony at sunset.

20:20.733 --> 20:22.701
Except that dress.

20:22.801 --> 20:25.736
<i>I mean, the synthetic lace
and the inverted box pleats.</i>

20:25.838 --> 20:28.033
I think it was perfect.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.735
- Well, they really did love each other.
- Yeah.

20:31.844 --> 20:34.677
<i>What are these?
Wedding announcements?</i>

20:34.780 --> 20:36.941
I'm-- No. They're just--
I was--

20:37.049 --> 20:39.017
Excuse me. I was going
to recycle them.

20:39.118 --> 20:41.484
Well, excuse me.
Into what? Wallpaper?

20:41.587 --> 20:43.953
It's just this one guy.

20:44.056 --> 20:47.492
Malcolm Doyle-- I only keep his.
He writes the best ones.

20:47.593 --> 20:51.222
I just-- I love the stories--
The crazy proposals...

20:51.330 --> 20:53.798
<i>the engagements.</i>

20:53.899 --> 20:57.892
Yeah. Never mind. It's not really your thing.
So, um, how long you stayin'?

20:58.003 --> 21:03.202
Um, a week or two 'cause the fall fashion
shows are done, so I don't have much work.

21:03.309 --> 21:07.268
Speaking of work. I am meeting up with some
people from the office tonight for a party.

21:07.379 --> 21:11.281
<i>- You wanna come?
- Actually, I'm having drinks
with some friends from Milan.</i>

21:11.383 --> 21:13.351
All right. So, let me
get this straight.

21:13.452 --> 21:16.148
You would rather go have drinks
with Italian models...

21:16.255 --> 21:18.621
than come to my awesome
work party?

21:18.724 --> 21:21.124
- Weird, huh?
- Yeah.

21:21.226 --> 21:23.126
- But I'll try to make it.
- Well, thanks.

21:23.228 --> 21:25.822
Grey Goose is in the freezer.
Red Bull's on top of the 'fridge.

21:25.931 --> 21:28.661
<i>-In the cupboard there are--
- Strawberry Pop Tarts.Jinx!</i>

21:28.767 --> 21:30.894
<i>I said it first. I beat you.</i>

21:36.175 --> 21:39.144
<i>- St. Marks and A.
- You got it.</i>

21:42.348 --> 21:44.714
<i>- Hi, Gina.
- Hey, George.</i>

21:44.817 --> 21:46.785
<i>- Great party.
- Thanks for comin'.</i>

21:48.887 --> 21:52.983
<i>- You got them champagne glasses
and a bottle of Cristal.
- Good.</i>

21:53.092 --> 21:56.118
All right. Any way she's gonna believe
that it actually came from me?

21:56.228 --> 21:59.220
- Maybe. I wrapped it like a car ran over it.
- Nice. Nice touch.

21:59.331 --> 22:01.925
Ah, look. I'm gonna go to the bar,
get a couple of drinks.

22:02.034 --> 22:04.229
You guys need anything.
A little liquid courage?

22:04.336 --> 22:06.463
Maybe some hair of the dog for you?

22:06.572 --> 22:09.632
I'm good. Thanks.

22:09.742 --> 22:14.975
He asks if you want a drink,
you smile and you say, "Vodka soda."

22:15.080 --> 22:18.811
If you already have a drink, you down it. Then
there's some flirting, some interoffice sex...

22:18.917 --> 22:22.375
an accidental pregnancy,
a shotgun wedding and a life of bliss.

22:22.488 --> 22:24.888
<i>How many times do we
have to go over this?</i>

22:24.990 --> 22:27.288
<i>- I don't want him
to think I'm irresponsible.
- Hey, guys.</i>

22:27.393 --> 22:29.452
Yeah. That's what guys want,
responsible. Mmm!

22:29.561 --> 22:32.189
You're wrong. George appreciates
me for the way I am.

22:32.297 --> 22:34.788
What good is it being
appreciated if no one is naked?

22:34.900 --> 22:37.300
<i>Hey,Jane. Look.
By the way...</i>

22:37.403 --> 22:40.566
did you get that thing
I left on your desk this morning?

22:40.673 --> 22:44.507
- O-On my desk?
- Yeah. Was that okay?

22:44.610 --> 22:48.341
- Okay? It was great.
- Okay. Good. Good.

22:48.447 --> 22:52.144
'Cause, you know, we haven't really
had that kind of relationship before...

22:52.251 --> 22:55.379
so I just wanted to make sure
you were okay with it.

22:55.487 --> 22:58.217
<i>- George!
- All right. Excuse me.</i>

22:59.858 --> 23:03.726
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
He gave me flowers. He gave me flowers.

23:03.829 --> 23:06.127
Okay. Stop it. This is real life.
This is not a fantasy.

23:06.231 --> 23:08.199
You have to go over there
and tell him how you feel.

23:08.300 --> 23:11.997
Okay. It's now or never,
so-- so now.

23:12.104 --> 23:14.902
- Now, now. Go. Now!
- Yeah.

23:25.451 --> 23:28.784
<i>Whoo!</i>

23:48.640 --> 23:51.575
-Jane.
- Sorry.

23:51.677 --> 23:56.944
George, this is my sister, Tess. Tess, this is
my George-- No! I didn't mean it like that.

23:57.049 --> 23:59.210
Jane is my assistant.
Kind of like my right hand.

23:59.318 --> 24:01.718
Lucky her.

24:01.820 --> 24:03.651
Yeah.

24:03.756 --> 24:06.316
It's kind of like whatever I need,
she takes care of.

24:06.425 --> 24:09.417
As if I don't take enough
advantage of her already...

24:09.528 --> 24:12.622
I even dropped my dry cleaning
slip off on her desk today.

24:12.731 --> 24:15.564
Your dry cleaning slip.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.761
- It was an emergency, so--
- Of course.

24:18.871 --> 24:20.839
Good fluff-and-fold
is no joking matter.

24:20.939 --> 24:23.965
Yeah. Especially when you're
down to your last pair of socks.

24:24.076 --> 24:26.271
Right.

24:28.881 --> 24:31.577
- You wanna get a drink?
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.683 --> 24:33.583
Came to have a drink
with my sister.

24:33.685 --> 24:35.949
<i>Janey?</i>

24:37.189 --> 24:39.521
Hi. How are ya?

24:39.625 --> 24:42.389
Were the flowers too much?

24:42.494 --> 24:45.019
- They're from you.
- Uh-huh.

24:45.130 --> 24:48.327
You sent them.
The angry marriage-hater.

24:48.433 --> 24:51.561
Oh, that's--That's such...
good news.

24:51.670 --> 24:54.161
Good news. Hey, Kev,
can you hold this for one sec?

24:54.273 --> 24:57.367
- Uh, sure.
- Thanks.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.105
Motherf--

25:07.319 --> 25:10.311
<i>Why? Why?</i>

25:12.991 --> 25:16.051
Oh.

25:16.161 --> 25:18.823
I'm so sorry.

25:18.931 --> 25:22.958
Congratulations.

25:23.068 --> 25:25.036
Fifty. Wow. That's--

25:32.744 --> 25:35.542
I'm sorry.
You were saying.

25:35.647 --> 25:39.174
Uh, I just asked
if you'd got my flowers.

25:39.284 --> 25:42.515
Oh, and I have
something for you.

25:42.621 --> 25:44.646
<i>I wanted to give you-</i>

25:44.756 --> 25:47.691
- Here you are.
- Oh, my God. Thank God.

25:47.793 --> 25:50.887
Yeah. You left it in the cab.
It was either the engagement party tonight...

25:50.996 --> 25:53.430
or Thursday's bikini wax,
so-- I thought that--

25:53.532 --> 25:56.365
- You read it?
- Yeah. Well, no. I tried to read it.

25:56.468 --> 26:00.199
It was very hard. All your little notes
in the little cramped handwriting.

26:00.305 --> 26:04.036
It's very Unabomber. You know, they do have
these Space Age computer date books now...

26:04.142 --> 26:06.133
- that take care of everything for you.
- Oh, yes.

26:06.245 --> 26:09.408
- I don't need to be taken care of. Thank you.
- Uh, have a drink with me.

26:09.514 --> 26:11.948
- Yeah?
- Uh, you know--

26:12.050 --> 26:15.383
<i>Thank you for bringing back
my Filofax. That was very nice.</i>

26:15.487 --> 26:18.923
It's a drink. It's not a week in Oahu.
Come on. It'll take the edge off.

26:19.024 --> 26:20.924
Come on.Just one drink.

26:21.026 --> 26:24.189
I'm sorry. I'm really not
gonna be very much...

26:24.296 --> 26:26.264
fun tonight.

26:26.365 --> 26:30.165
Got it. Totally got it. So maybe
I'll bump into you on Thursday.

26:30.269 --> 26:32.237
Maybe not. I'll see
you around.

26:34.773 --> 26:37.037
Who was that? And where
can I get one?

26:37.142 --> 26:39.110
Is he coming back?

26:39.211 --> 26:41.771
That's freakin' insane. I could never do that.

26:41.880 --> 26:43.780
- No, no.
- You didn't eat it?

26:46.585 --> 26:49.713
Oh, my God.
I didn't even see it. I promise.

26:49.821 --> 26:53.951
It's late. You must be exhausted.
Let's--You wanna--

26:54.059 --> 26:57.927
- Let's go dancing.
- What? No. I don't-- George, you don't wanna--

26:58.030 --> 27:00.260
Yeah. No. I'll go.
Okay.

27:00.365 --> 27:03.334
- Yeah, but I gotta warn you.
I'm a terrible dancer.
- Come on.

27:03.435 --> 27:06.131
No. It's true. In fact, on several occasions,
they've had to call the paramedics.

27:06.238 --> 27:09.639
- You wanna come too,Jane?
- Um--

27:10.542 --> 27:13.602
No, no. You guys go.

27:13.712 --> 27:16.909
- Have a good time.
- Okay. Let's go.

27:42.140 --> 27:46.133
Go to sleep,Jane.

27:46.244 --> 27:49.839
Go to sleep.
3:00 a.m.?

27:54.953 --> 27:58.787
<i># Well, sometimes
I go out by myself #</i>

27:58.890 --> 28:02.849
<i>#And I look across
the water #</i>

28:04.229 --> 28:07.630
<i>#And I think of all the things
what you're doin'#</i>

28:07.733 --> 28:11.294
<i>#And in my head
I paint a picture #</i>

28:13.171 --> 28:15.298
<i># 'Cause since I come home #</i>

28:15.407 --> 28:17.898
<i># Well, my body's been
a mess #</i>

28:18.010 --> 28:20.035
<i>#And I miss your tender hair #</i>

28:20.145 --> 28:22.739
<i>#And the way
you like to dress #</i>

28:22.848 --> 28:25.214
<i>#Oh, won't you come on over #</i>

28:25.317 --> 28:29.378
<i>#Stop making a fool
out of me #</i>

28:29.488 --> 28:34.357
<i># Why don't you come on over,
Valerie ##</i>

28:34.459 --> 28:37.155
Oh, hi, Tess.
How was your date? Nice? What?

28:37.262 --> 28:39.423
You talked about me
the whole time?

28:39.531 --> 28:42.022
Don't feel bad. I'm a really important
part of his life.

28:42.134 --> 28:44.864
We spend every hour,
every day together.

28:47.172 --> 28:49.936
<i>- Hey! Still up?
- Hi.</i>

28:50.042 --> 28:54.411
<i>Yeah. Yeah,just doin' a little bit of cleaning.
Harnessing my chi.</i>

28:54.513 --> 28:58.108
Janey, I had...

28:58.216 --> 29:00.741
the best night ever.

29:00.852 --> 29:03.446
<i>Oh, that's right!
I totally forgot you went out.</i>

29:03.555 --> 29:05.853
- Ow!
- Is that weird for you?

29:05.957 --> 29:09.620
What? Weird? Why would it be weird?
He's my boss. I don't care. Whatever.

29:09.728 --> 29:12.526
- Okay. Great. 'Cause we're
having lunch tomorrow.
- That's so great!

29:12.631 --> 29:15.600
<i>Yeah. I think so too.
Except not quite at that decibel.</i>

29:17.569 --> 29:20.663
So tell me about George.

29:20.772 --> 29:23.969
Oh. Well. I--

29:25.811 --> 29:27.779
Uh, he, uh--

29:27.879 --> 29:31.872
Well, he dropped
out of college...

29:31.983 --> 29:35.282
<i>and then climbed
every major peak in the world.</i>

29:35.387 --> 29:37.355
And then he started Urban Everest
from his apartment...

29:37.456 --> 29:41.187
and turned it into one of the most eco-friendly
philanthropic businesses in the world--

29:41.293 --> 29:43.261
all before he was 30.

29:43.361 --> 29:45.261
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:45.363 --> 29:48.230
And that's just his resume.
He is an unbelievable boss.
Everybody loves him. Everybody.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.927
And he loves his dog, Gatsby,
more than anyone.

29:51.036 --> 29:53.163
He doesn't eat red meat,
which is kinda cool.

29:53.271 --> 29:57.002
And he would rather spend
all his time outside than anywhere else.

29:57.109 --> 29:59.509
My God.
He sounds amazing.

30:01.680 --> 30:04.274
Yeah. Yeah, but he has flaws.
He does.

30:04.382 --> 30:06.282
He is flawed.

30:06.384 --> 30:10.912
- What do you mean?
- Well, he hates cashews...

30:11.022 --> 30:12.990
which is weird.

30:13.091 --> 30:16.151
And sometimes he doesn't
wear socks with sneakers.

30:16.261 --> 30:18.456
I just think that's gross.

30:18.563 --> 30:21.623
Jane.Jane, those aren't
exactly deal-breakers.

30:21.733 --> 30:24.964
Deal. Wh-What deal?

30:25.070 --> 30:28.870
I mean, nothing happened
between the two of you tonight, did it?

30:28.974 --> 30:31.534
- Did it?
- Well.

30:31.643 --> 30:35.602
<i>Oh. I got ya. Nice.</i>

30:35.714 --> 30:37.909
Mmm. Fun.

30:38.016 --> 30:40.382
Sounds fun.

30:45.323 --> 30:48.850
- Dad?
- Oh, hey, sweetie.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.985
<i>How are you? Oh,
you didn't have to--</i>

30:51.096 --> 30:55.465
Tessie! Oh! Oh!

30:55.567 --> 30:58.001
- Hi.
- Look at you.

30:58.103 --> 31:02.039
Oh, Dad. This place
looks exactly the same.

31:02.140 --> 31:04.040
Now that's not fair.

31:04.142 --> 31:08.135
I got a brand-new awning. I just stripped
and re-varnished all the woodwork. Look.

31:08.246 --> 31:10.544
- New cash register. Digital.
- Oh.

31:10.649 --> 31:13.209
Wow, Dad. I'm sorry.
I don't know how I missed all these...

31:13.318 --> 31:15.218
remarkable improvements.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.880
<i>Give me that. Let's go upstairs.</i>

31:19.191 --> 31:20.681
<i>There we go.</i>

31:20.792 --> 31:23.022
<i>Dad, aren't we a little
old for these?</i>

31:23.128 --> 31:25.358
- No.
- Good, 'cause I love 'em!

31:25.463 --> 31:28.523
So, Tess, how long you here for?

31:30.368 --> 31:32.336
One to two weeks, right?
That's what you said.

31:32.437 --> 31:36.533
Um, actually, it just depends
on how a few things pan out.

31:36.641 --> 31:39.542
What things?

31:39.644 --> 31:42.738
What-What-What few things? What's--

31:46.618 --> 31:50.213
<i>- Hello? Hi!
- Let me guess.</i>

31:50.322 --> 31:52.449
<i>Some new guy is chasing
after her?</i>

31:52.557 --> 31:56.721
I wouldn't call it
"chasing."

31:57.829 --> 32:00.764
<i>- Oh, George. I would love to.
-Jane?</i>

32:00.865 --> 32:03.060
- What?
- You okay?

32:03.168 --> 32:06.729
Yeah! Oh, yeah. Great.
Fine. Everything's fine.

32:09.574 --> 32:13.271
<i>Of course.</i>

32:16.348 --> 32:18.248
I gotta stop.

32:25.490 --> 32:27.390
She's gonna call me.
I guarantee it.

32:27.492 --> 32:30.484
- I got a way of making
the ladies reach out to me.
- Oh, yeah. How?

32:32.030 --> 32:35.329
Oh, God.

32:37.636 --> 32:40.503
Whoo! Ah. "Yello."

32:40.605 --> 32:43.233
You ripped a week out of my planner.
Are you insane?

32:43.341 --> 32:47.175
It's a little experiment. See how you do
without every second of your life mapped out.

32:47.279 --> 32:49.474
By the way,
your life is insane.

32:49.581 --> 32:51.742
What do you do besides
work and help people get married?

32:51.850 --> 32:54.318
You know what? I don't see how
that's any of your business.

32:54.419 --> 32:56.319
How do you afford
these weddings?

32:56.421 --> 32:58.946
I mean, the dresses, the airfares,
the wine of the month clubs?

32:59.057 --> 33:01.082
Hey, people love that gift.
And I'm a frequent member.

33:01.192 --> 33:03.922
So sometimes they throw in
a free gewurztraminer.

33:04.029 --> 33:06.725
Wow. That is terribly sad.
I'm sorry about that.

33:06.831 --> 33:08.696
Ah. Well, look. I wanna
make it up to you.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.860
Okay? How about a new date book
or maybe just a date?

33:11.970 --> 33:14.029
Uh, yeah. Sure.
Let me just pencil you in.

33:14.139 --> 33:17.267
Except, hey! You already did.
Every Saturday for the rest of the year.

33:17.375 --> 33:20.674
You know what? Can you please, please
find someone else to be creepy with?

33:20.779 --> 33:23.577
Nope. Tell you what. Anytime
you wanna hang out with somebody...

33:23.682 --> 33:26.515
who doesn't need you to take them
to a fitting or a cake-tasting...

33:26.618 --> 33:29.109
or a coed mojito and burrito rehearsal dinner,
just give me a call.

33:29.220 --> 33:32.314
Yeah. Okay.

33:32.424 --> 33:34.790
Oh, God.

33:36.928 --> 33:39.328
- Hey!
- Hey!

33:39.431 --> 33:41.524
- Are we getting too old for hugs?
- No.

33:41.633 --> 33:43.601
Thank you.

33:43.702 --> 33:45.670
<i>There he is.</i>

33:45.770 --> 33:48.364
<i>- Pedro. How's it goin'?
- Hey, what's up?</i>

33:48.473 --> 33:52.933
- So Pedro is my, uh--
- I'm his little brother.

33:53.044 --> 33:56.013
From the Big Brother
Program at the Y.

33:56.114 --> 33:59.982
- Oh.
- Pedro, Tess happens to be Jane's sister.

34:00.085 --> 34:03.646
<i>- Oh.
- Hola, Pedro.</i>

34:05.123 --> 34:09.150
Yeah. Um, look,Jane,
Tess and I...

34:09.260 --> 34:11.558
<i>are gonna take Pedro to his baseball game
if you wanna join us.</i>

34:11.663 --> 34:14.063
I can't. I've got so much work to do.
I should stay here.

34:14.165 --> 34:16.395
Are you kidding me,Jane?
Look, your boss is a jerk anyhow.

34:16.501 --> 34:19.368
- Let's go. I don't wanna have to fire you.
- Okay.

34:19.471 --> 34:22.406
<i>All right?
All right. Let's go.</i>

34:26.277 --> 34:28.438
- Hey. How you doin'?
- All right.

34:28.545 --> 34:31.514
Let me get three Diet Pepsis,
three fries and--

34:31.616 --> 34:34.050
- Chili dog. You want a chili dog?
- Uh, no.

34:34.152 --> 34:38.054
- Not unless it's a tofu dog with meatless chili.
- I'm sorry. What?

34:38.156 --> 34:40.920
- You're a vegetarian?
- Uh-huh. It's recent.

34:41.025 --> 34:43.960
- Oh, is it?
- You know, 'cause I'm a vegetarian too.

34:44.062 --> 34:46.553
- Oh.
- I used to be a vegan,
but it was too much of a hassle.

34:46.664 --> 34:49.929
Oh, God. I know. I mean, even being
a vegetarian is a challenge.

34:50.034 --> 34:53.936
I mean, every time I go hiking, I have
to bring my homemade "to furky jerky."

34:54.038 --> 34:56.699
You go hiking?
I mean, no offense...

34:56.808 --> 34:59.868
but you hardly seem like the kind of girl
that hits the trails--

34:59.978 --> 35:01.969
Especially
in those shoes.

35:02.080 --> 35:05.243
Don't be silly. The best "to furky"
is made by publicists in kitten heels.

35:05.350 --> 35:08.046
I can see how you would think that,
but I actually love...

35:08.153 --> 35:10.053
all that outdoorsy
type of stuff--

35:10.155 --> 35:13.921
You know, hiking and biking
and climbing up things.

35:14.025 --> 35:19.725
But, to tell you the truth, I haven't been
hiking since--Well, since my dog died.

35:19.831 --> 35:22.425
See Jane and I had this
dog growing up, Tory.

35:22.534 --> 35:24.434
I just-- I loved him.

35:24.536 --> 35:29.769
He would just go on nature hikes
and climbing adventures.

35:29.874 --> 35:34.106
Not a day goes by that I don't think about
that bag of fleas.

35:34.212 --> 35:37.113
Good ol' Tory.

35:37.215 --> 35:40.309
Jane, how come you never
mentioned Tory?

35:40.418 --> 35:44.855
<i>I don't know. I must have
repressed the memory of Toby.</i>

35:46.524 --> 35:51.291
Yeah. His name was "Toby," but I called him
"Tory" because I had a lisp.

35:51.396 --> 35:54.593
A lisp that turned
your "B's" to "R's"?

35:54.699 --> 35:56.633
You know what?
When I was a kid, I had a stutter.

35:56.734 --> 35:58.702
No way!

35:58.803 --> 36:01.931
- We have more things
in common than I thought.
- Yeah, me too.

36:06.811 --> 36:09.678
I'm gonna go out and shag
some flies with Pedro.

36:09.781 --> 36:13.376
Ooh! I'm jealous. It sounds fun.

36:14.786 --> 36:16.686
- What are "shagging flies"?
- What are you doing?

36:16.788 --> 36:19.382
- What?
- You hate dogs and tofu and being outside.

36:19.491 --> 36:23.427
No. I like yachts. I like flowers.
I like, you know, tanning.

36:23.528 --> 36:26.361
- I mean, it's not exactly the same--
- And you hated Toby.

36:26.464 --> 36:29.490
You hated him. The only animals you ever
cared about are dead ones with sleeves.

36:29.601 --> 36:33.594
You're just saying all this stuff
because George is so... attractive.

36:33.705 --> 36:36.697
- Or some people think he is.
- I did not hate that dog.

36:36.808 --> 36:38.708
I just hated it
when he slobbered on me.

36:38.810 --> 36:43.406
And I could like soy milk
and hiking if I tried it. Maybe.

36:45.183 --> 36:48.175
Hey, Tess. What do you say
you come out here. Let's see that arm.

36:48.286 --> 36:51.687
Ooh. Fun. Are we gonna shag now?

36:54.859 --> 36:57.419
- Ever done this before?
- No. I don't know how to do this.

36:57.529 --> 36:59.156
- Here you go.
- Okay. Like that?

36:59.264 --> 37:01.858
Put this arm down there. All right?
Hold that elbow up.

37:01.966 --> 37:04.764
<i>- Okay.
- All right. Hold it there.</i>

37:04.869 --> 37:06.837
Hi.

37:06.938 --> 37:10.101
Thank you.
Thank you.

37:14.045 --> 37:17.173
<i>- Oh.
- #I'm in like with you #</i>

37:17.282 --> 37:19.182
- "Love, George."
- Ah.

37:19.284 --> 37:22.776
<i>#Not in love with you
quite yet #</i>

37:22.887 --> 37:25.617
<i>- George.
- #My heart's beginning to #</i>

37:25.723 --> 37:27.748
Oh, that's terrific.

37:27.859 --> 37:31.295
<i>#Slightly overrule
my head #</i>

37:31.396 --> 37:35.025
<i>#Oh, no, oh, no
My self-control #</i>

37:35.133 --> 37:40.196
<i>#It won't hold up for very long #</i>

37:40.305 --> 37:42.603
<i>#Oh, no, oh, no #</i>

37:42.707 --> 37:45.005
<i>- # You touch my soul #
- We should all go fishing together sometime.</i>

37:45.109 --> 37:47.543
Wouldn't that be great?

37:54.085 --> 37:56.417
<i># 'Cause I might need
a moment #</i>

37:56.521 --> 37:58.580
<i>#And I wouldn't wanna spoil it
Who knows #</i>

37:58.690 --> 38:02.751
<i>#If I am
ready or not #</i>

38:02.860 --> 38:05.988
<i>- # To date or not #
- #Only time will tell #</i>

38:06.097 --> 38:08.258
<i># Who knows #</i>

38:08.366 --> 38:12.962
<i>#If we are ready
to make this #</i>

38:13.071 --> 38:14.971
<i>#Something #</i>

38:15.073 --> 38:18.065
<i># Who knows #</i>

38:18.176 --> 38:20.508
<i>#Mmm,yeah #</i>

38:24.282 --> 38:28.343
You know that in sign language,
this means "I love you."

38:28.453 --> 38:32.981
<i>- #But I haven't fallen in quite yet #
- I love you too, Tess.</i>

38:33.091 --> 38:34.991
<i>#Oh, no, oh, no #</i>

38:35.093 --> 38:37.823
<i>#My self-control #</i>

38:37.929 --> 38:42.593
<i>#It won't hold up
for very long #</i>

38:42.700 --> 38:44.793
<i>#Oh, no, oh, no #</i>

38:44.902 --> 38:47.200
<i># You touch my soul #</i>

38:47.305 --> 38:49.603
<i>#I can't help falling
too fast for you #</i>

38:49.707 --> 38:52.835
<i>- # Who knows #
-Jane!</i>

38:52.944 --> 38:56.345
<i>#If I am
ready or not ##</i>

38:56.447 --> 38:59.143
- Which one sucks less?
- This one.

38:59.250 --> 39:02.708
- Good. Maybe, uh, would you mind again?
- Nope.

39:02.820 --> 39:05.288
- Thank you.
- I do it for my dad all the time.

39:07.625 --> 39:10.025
You okay? You seem
a little bit nervous.

39:10.128 --> 39:13.791
Yeah. No. I'm cool.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.328
- How's it look?
- Great.

39:19.437 --> 39:21.564
- Here you go. Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

40:03.214 --> 40:06.342
Oh, hey. Guys, guys! Hold it.
She's not the one. She's not the one.

40:06.451 --> 40:11.445
<i>Hey.Jane.</i>

40:11.556 --> 40:16.289
I'm so sorry. I should've called,
but you forgot your wallet.

40:16.394 --> 40:20.023
Oh. Well, thanks.

40:20.131 --> 40:22.463
Sorry I'm late.

40:22.567 --> 40:26.196
Hey, guys. Now, now.

40:26.304 --> 40:30.638
Jane, what's going on?

40:33.778 --> 40:35.905
Come here, boy.

40:36.013 --> 40:38.140
Golly. Here you go.

40:42.820 --> 40:45.755
- Oh!
- Hey, Tess.

40:45.857 --> 40:47.984
- Sorry.
- Um--

40:48.092 --> 40:50.720
Will you do me a favor?
Sit down a second.

40:50.828 --> 40:53.626
Okay.

40:56.234 --> 41:02.104
<i>So, Tess. My parents met playing hopscotch
when they were, like, eight years old...</i>

41:02.206 --> 41:04.800
<i>and they were married
for 42 years.</i>

41:04.909 --> 41:09.346
And I've been waiting my whole life
to feel the way my dad felt about my mom.

41:09.447 --> 41:12.780
<i>And maybe I've been too busy
trying to make something of myself...</i>

41:12.884 --> 41:15.250
<i>- but, I think I...
- Oh!</i>

41:15.353 --> 41:17.412
<i>missed some
of those moments.</i>

41:17.522 --> 41:19.513
<i>- But, Tess, the second that I saw you...
- Okay.</i>

41:19.624 --> 41:22.821
<i>I knew that we could
be great together.</i>

41:22.927 --> 41:25.521
So, um--

41:25.630 --> 41:28.656
Tess, will you marry me?

41:28.766 --> 41:32.202
Yes, of course I will.

41:32.303 --> 41:35.136
George.

41:43.080 --> 41:45.344
So, wait. Does this mean
that you're moving back here?

41:45.449 --> 41:48.213
Yup.

41:48.319 --> 41:51.220
Whoa. Well, I-- I don't know what to say.
You give Jane a job...

41:51.322 --> 41:54.052
<i>then you get Tessie
to move back home.</i>

41:54.158 --> 41:56.922
George, you're my hero.
I mean it.

41:57.028 --> 42:00.361
Oh, thank you. You have a couple
of pretty great girls here.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.631
Wait.Just a second. I wanna get somethin'.
Don't go anywhere.

42:06.804 --> 42:09.568
<i>Who isn't?</i>

42:09.674 --> 42:11.801
<i>I'm so excited
that we did this today.</i>

42:11.909 --> 42:15.037
<i>- He's so happy.
- Tess.</i>

42:15.146 --> 42:18.479
Daddy!

42:18.583 --> 42:22.178
- Your mother would've wanted you to have it.
- Daddy, thank you!

42:22.286 --> 42:24.220
<i>Okay.</i>

42:24.322 --> 42:27.814
<i>- Thank you.
- Okay.</i>

42:27.925 --> 42:31.088
-Jane, you don't mind, right?
- No. No.

42:31.195 --> 42:35.256
- You can have it after me.
- No. That's good. It's right.
Mom would've wanted that.

42:35.366 --> 42:37.800
- Yeah. Mom would've wanted that.
- That's my Jane.

42:37.902 --> 42:39.961
Okay. Yeah.
That's right.

42:40.071 --> 42:43.734
It was my mother's.

42:43.841 --> 42:46.742
- Isn't that amazing?
- That's beautiful.

42:46.844 --> 42:50.507
Dad, I don't even know
what to say.

42:52.116 --> 42:55.210
<i>Uh, so I'm just trying to figure out why
you decided to meet with me.</i>

42:55.319 --> 42:57.287
You've been ducking me
and then, all of a sudden--

42:57.388 --> 42:59.913
My little sister's
getting married.

43:00.024 --> 43:02.117
- Ah, before you.
- That's not what I'm upset about.

43:02.226 --> 43:04.057
Then what are you
upset about?

43:04.161 --> 43:07.824
You don't know Tess.
She's gonna want me to do everything.

43:07.932 --> 43:09.866
I'm not gonna just be
her maid of honor.

43:09.967 --> 43:12.697
I'm gonna be taking care
of everything.

43:12.803 --> 43:15.101
- So why don't you just say, "No"?
- What?

43:15.206 --> 43:17.572
Say, "No."

43:17.675 --> 43:21.634
- You have said, "No," to people before?
- Yes. Of course.

43:21.746 --> 43:25.773
Many, many times.
In this situation, never. Not once.

43:25.883 --> 43:28.511
Ah, but you want
to say, "No."

43:28.619 --> 43:30.780
But I can't.
It's my sister.

43:30.888 --> 43:33.550
But you can say, "No."
Because it's your sister--

43:33.658 --> 43:36.456
All right. You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna practice.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.994
All right? We're gonna practice saying, "No."
You think I'm kidding?

43:39.096 --> 43:41.428
Turn around. We're gonna play this game.
Come on. Humor me.

43:41.532 --> 43:44.057
All right.Jane,
give me 50 bucks.

43:44.168 --> 43:47.569
- No!
-Jane, it's 50 bucks. I'll pay you back.

43:47.672 --> 43:51.267
No.

43:52.410 --> 43:55.243
Jane, I need you...

43:55.346 --> 43:57.337
to give me 50 bucks.

43:59.317 --> 44:02.115
No?

44:02.219 --> 44:04.380
Eh, not bad.

44:04.488 --> 44:06.718
- Can I have your drink?
- Sure.

44:06.824 --> 44:08.724
No!

44:08.826 --> 44:12.387
- Oh, no.
- You were doing so well.

44:12.496 --> 44:14.760
- That's terrible.
- Mm-hmm.

44:14.932 --> 44:18.163
<i>- So you went by the flower shop
and ordered the favors?
- Yup.</i>

44:18.269 --> 44:20.169
- Uh-huh.
- What about the invitation mock-ups?

44:20.271 --> 44:22.262
- Done.
- This is so much fun!

44:24.375 --> 44:26.741
Did I tell you I asked Julie
to be one of the bridesmaids?

44:26.844 --> 44:29.745
- Who?
- Cousin Julie. Second cousin twice removed.

44:31.582 --> 44:33.743
- What about Mimi? Cousin Mimi?
- Oh, no way.

44:33.851 --> 44:37.446
She's so pregnant. It'll just throw
off the aesthetics.

44:37.555 --> 44:39.921
I'm sorry. I know
you don't love Julie.

44:40.024 --> 44:42.515
What's not to love about
a woman who asked me if I chaired...

44:42.626 --> 44:45.459
the Itty Bitty Titty Committee
all through my teen years?

44:45.563 --> 44:50.000
Just don't listen to her. Your boobs came
in eventually. They just missed high school.

44:50.101 --> 44:52.569
As for the third bridesmaid,
I want you to ask your friend...

44:52.670 --> 44:54.661
- that really rude one.
- Casey?

44:54.772 --> 44:57.206
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- My Casey?

44:57.308 --> 44:59.572
She's really pretty.
She can pull off the strapless.

44:59.677 --> 45:02.703
I don't have that many girlfriends.
For some reason, girls just don't like me.

45:02.813 --> 45:05.213
I don't know why.

45:05.316 --> 45:07.978
Okay. Fine. I know why.
Will you just ask her?

45:11.022 --> 45:12.990
Sure. Of course.

45:13.090 --> 45:16.253
So I was also thinking we could
do a slide show for the rehearsal dinner.

45:16.360 --> 45:19.693
You know, put pictures of George
and I together and say funny things.

45:19.797 --> 45:23.062
- Okay.
- Oh, and guess what.
That writer you obsess about...

45:23.167 --> 45:26.000
<i>he wants to do a whole Commitments
column on us in the Journal.</i>

45:26.103 --> 45:28.037
He called me.
Can you believe it?

45:28.139 --> 45:30.130
At this point,
I absolutely can.

45:30.241 --> 45:33.540
Listen, um, I've been thinking a lot about
what you said, and I think you're right.

45:33.644 --> 45:37.478
I think it would be so special if I did
a wedding just like Mom and Dad's.

45:37.581 --> 45:41.381
-Just like?
- You know, especially since
I'm wearing Mom's dress.

45:41.485 --> 45:44.249
So, ta-da!

45:44.355 --> 45:47.791
<i>- The Boathouse?
- Uh-huh.</i>

45:47.892 --> 45:51.293
At first, when I called, they said they had
no availability for 18 months.

45:51.395 --> 45:54.296
But then the ninth time I called,
they said they had a cancellation.

45:54.398 --> 45:57.094
Apparently the bride slept
with the groom's father and brother...

45:57.201 --> 45:59.294
and sister
and all these people.

45:59.403 --> 46:02.531
So, obviously, it got canceled
and they were all devastated.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.608
But which means...

46:04.708 --> 46:06.869
we're getting married
in three weeks.

46:06.977 --> 46:08.968
Three weeks?

46:09.080 --> 46:11.742
Uh-huh. Oh,Jane. I know
you can pull it together quickly.

46:11.849 --> 46:14.545
And I didn't wanna wait
that long anyway, so--

46:19.757 --> 46:21.725
Uh, you could be a little
excited for me.

46:21.826 --> 46:26.126
No, I am. I am.
It's just--

46:26.230 --> 46:29.165
It's just that you wanted to get married
at The Boathouse in Mom's dress too.

46:29.266 --> 46:32.633
I know.

46:32.736 --> 46:35.864
No, I just-- I didn't know that
that's what you wanted...

46:35.973 --> 46:38.737
but if it is, then I just want
you to be happy.

46:38.843 --> 46:40.970
- You know that.
- Great!

46:41.078 --> 46:43.478
Okay. Now can we talk about
more important stuff?

46:43.581 --> 46:47.449
Come on. I really don't like the linens,
and I think we need to rent new ones...

46:47.551 --> 46:50.452
because they do not go with the color
scheme that I picked out.

46:50.554 --> 46:52.988
That selfish whore.

46:54.058 --> 46:56.117
<i>- Namaste.
- Namaste.</i>

46:56.227 --> 46:58.127
I can't believe it.
I cannot believe it.

46:58.229 --> 47:01.255
There is no man that won't fall for her.
Even a do-gooder like George.

47:01.365 --> 47:06.029
<i>Men just become hypnotized by her voodoo
and they lose their minds.</i>

47:06.137 --> 47:09.629
You can't plan your sister's
wedding to the man you love. It's sick.

47:09.740 --> 47:11.867
To be fair, she didn't
know how I felt about him.

47:11.976 --> 47:14.604
And nor should she--
He's my boss.

47:14.712 --> 47:18.079
I'm just gonna have to get over it.
I don't really have a choice.

47:18.182 --> 47:20.150
And neither do you.

47:20.251 --> 47:21.775
She wants you to be
a bridesmaid.

47:21.886 --> 47:24.286
You are shitting me.

47:24.388 --> 47:25.946
- Hello?
- Please.

47:26.056 --> 47:28.991
No. No, I won't do it,
on principle.

47:29.093 --> 47:32.995
I say, "No," on principle.
No. You can count me out.

47:33.097 --> 47:36.191
Please. Please don't
leave me alone in this.

47:36.300 --> 47:38.393
- Please, please, please.
- Fine. Fine.

47:38.502 --> 47:41.801
Because it's you. But if she crosses me,
I'm gonna kick her ass.

47:41.906 --> 47:45.137
And then I will kick your ass.
Then I'm gonna have a couple drinks--

47:48.012 --> 47:52.176
There's no sign
that says, "No talking."

47:56.720 --> 48:00.053
<i>Three weeks?
It cannot be done.</i>

48:00.157 --> 48:03.593
<i>- It is not enough time for one of my creations!
- Okay, um...</i>

48:03.694 --> 48:07.687
Antoine, remember when I
brought you the Schecters...

48:07.798 --> 48:10.995
and they commissioned that six-tiered,
heart-shaped masterpiece?

48:11.101 --> 48:13.763
Then, of course,
the tower of edible gifts...

48:13.871 --> 48:15.862
for the Schifman-Guardino
outdoor fiesta.

48:15.973 --> 48:18.999
You can do anything,
and we both know it.

48:19.109 --> 48:22.010
You're gonna do the cake,
and you're gonna do it in three weeks...

48:22.112 --> 48:24.580
- and I would like a discount, please.
- Three weeks?

48:24.682 --> 48:27.276
- It pleases me.
- Delightful.

48:27.384 --> 48:30.376
<i>We have a cake.</i>

48:31.956 --> 48:34.925
- What are you doing here?
- Hi. I'm Malcolm Doyle.

48:35.025 --> 48:38.893
- What?
- Oh, yes. I didn't wanna
believe it till you were here.

48:38.996 --> 48:42.056
<i>- Um, this is my fiance, George.
- Hi. Congratulations...</i>

48:42.166 --> 48:44.794
<i>- to the both of you.
- Thank you.</i>

48:44.902 --> 48:46.961
Oh. Babe, I gotta
take this. All right?

48:47.071 --> 48:49.096
<i>- Okay.
- If there's a cake emergency...</i>

48:49.206 --> 48:51.367
I'm right over here.

48:51.475 --> 48:53.136
Oh, and this is Jane,
my sister.

48:53.244 --> 48:55.804
She's obsessed with your stories.

48:55.913 --> 48:58.643
- She keeps them, but pretends
she doesn't, but she does.
- Okay.

48:58.749 --> 49:01.047
<i>She's your number one fan.</i>

49:01.151 --> 49:03.051
Not in a creepy way though.

49:03.153 --> 49:07.214
- Right.
- You said your name was "Kevin."

49:07.324 --> 49:09.815
As in "Kevin."

49:09.927 --> 49:12.987
Well, I use "Malcolm" for the byline
so I don't get stalked by crazy brides.

49:13.097 --> 49:15.861
- So how did you meet George?
- You're an asshole.

49:15.966 --> 49:18.400
-Jane.
- What? I'm sorry. He said his name was "Kevin."

49:18.502 --> 49:21.630
- I'm just-- I'm a little bit confused.
- Wait.

49:21.739 --> 49:26.301
- You guys know each other?
- Well, we both work the wedding circuit, so--

49:26.410 --> 49:30.346
Can you just give us one second?
I'm just gonna-- over-- for one second...

49:30.447 --> 49:32.415
talk to-- talk about you.

49:32.516 --> 49:35.349
Antoine.

49:35.452 --> 49:37.352
You lied to me.

49:37.454 --> 49:40.252
No. I told you I was a writer.
I didn't tell you what I wrote.

49:40.357 --> 49:45.021
But-- But you write
the most beautiful things.

49:45.129 --> 49:47.962
Do you actually believe in love
and marriage and pretend to be a cynic...

49:48.065 --> 49:52.365
or are you a cynic who knows how to spin
romantic crap for girls like me?

49:52.469 --> 49:56.371
I didn't follow that at all. But I think
the second one, the spinning crap one.

49:56.473 --> 50:01.638
Oh, my God. I feel like I found out my favorite
love song was written about a sandwich.

50:01.745 --> 50:05.203
<i>Um, can I steal you away
to tell you about George and me?</i>

50:05.316 --> 50:07.307
Of course. Of course.
That's why I'm here.

50:33.077 --> 50:35.944
What? Tess is not here.

50:36.046 --> 50:39.709
- I'm here to see you.
- Why?

50:39.817 --> 50:43.253
<i>Come on. I have to talk
to all of the friends and family.</i>

50:43.354 --> 50:46.687
<i>It'll take five minutes.
Please?</i>

50:46.790 --> 50:50.248
For George and Tess?

50:50.361 --> 50:52.261
Well, okay.

50:53.364 --> 50:56.231
Thank you.

50:56.333 --> 50:58.824
- May I come in?
-Just ask me what you wanna ask me.

50:58.936 --> 51:02.235
- Or would you prefer to lie some more?
- I didn't lie to you.

51:02.339 --> 51:04.364
I don't know why
you keep saying that.

51:04.475 --> 51:07.137
- I may have left out a couple of things.
- Can we just get this over with?

51:07.244 --> 51:11.044
The maid of honor
is a peculiar young woman.

51:11.148 --> 51:15.209
So tell me how you feel
about Tess's whirlwind romance.

51:15.319 --> 51:17.287
I couldn't be happier.
She's my kid sister.

51:17.388 --> 51:19.583
I taught her how to tell time,
how to ride a bike...

51:19.690 --> 51:21.590
how to steam flounder
in the dishwasher.

51:21.692 --> 51:25.287
I mean, I practically raised her--
Oh, please, don't print that.

51:25.396 --> 51:28.627
That would kill my father.

51:28.732 --> 51:31.200
Wait. What are those?

51:32.302 --> 51:34.862
Nothing.

51:34.972 --> 51:36.872
- Are those--
- No!

51:40.911 --> 51:43.539
- Are they bridesmaid dresses?
- This is none of your business.

51:43.647 --> 51:47.014
Oh! Good God.

51:47.117 --> 51:49.950
What? You kept them all?
You have a whole closet full. Why?

51:50.053 --> 51:52.715
I have a lot of friends
and I like to keep them.

51:52.823 --> 51:55.417
Right. Well, that makes
complete sense...

51:55.526 --> 51:58.086
- because they're beautiful.
- Some are not that bad.

51:58.195 --> 52:00.595
"Not that bad"? I'd like to see one of them
that's not that bad.

52:00.697 --> 52:02.631
Fine.

52:02.733 --> 52:05.531
Um, well--
Not that one.

52:05.636 --> 52:09.436
This one--
This one is really--

52:09.540 --> 52:11.508
Horrible. Right?
Was the word you're looking for.

52:11.608 --> 52:13.667
What color is this? Vomit?

52:13.777 --> 52:15.904
No, it's like a-- It's an "olivey" green.
It's very in.

52:16.013 --> 52:17.913
I'm telling you,
it looks great on.

52:18.015 --> 52:21.212
Uh, no. I'm telling you
that this is an instrument of torture...

52:21.318 --> 52:23.582
inflicted on you by a bride
who wants you to look ugly.

52:23.687 --> 52:26.622
No.Jenna picked it
because it looks good on everybody.

52:26.723 --> 52:29.988
Slightly delusional and will believe
anything anyone tells her.

52:30.093 --> 52:33.358
That is not true and I'm going
to show you you are wrong.

52:46.477 --> 52:48.377
See?

52:48.479 --> 52:52.939
It's not so bad.
This sash is really very flat--

52:53.050 --> 52:55.644
Okay. You are totally right
about the dress. It is not that bad.

52:55.752 --> 52:57.720
But, come on.
The color? Please.

52:57.821 --> 53:02.315
Well, it's your flash.
I think it's blowing it out weird...

53:02.426 --> 53:04.553
and if it were just a normal--
Okay, it's not very good.

53:04.661 --> 53:07.289
You kind of look
like a shiny mermaid.

53:09.433 --> 53:12.732
You should be flattered. She didn't want
to stand next to a tall, beautiful woman...

53:12.836 --> 53:15.100
and have you actually
looking decent.

53:15.205 --> 53:19.574
It's really not the worst one.

53:19.676 --> 53:21.837
<i>If I had to pick one--
I got a good one.</i>

53:25.916 --> 53:28.680
- This is my favorite.
- Oh, my God.

53:28.785 --> 53:30.753
- What the hell is that?
- Theme wedding.

53:30.854 --> 53:34.756
What was the theme, "humiliation"? God!

53:34.858 --> 53:37.918
<i>- No, people do not have
Gone With The Wind weddings.
- I have been to three.</i>

53:38.028 --> 53:40.724
<i>- Let's do it.
- All right.</i>

53:40.831 --> 53:42.822
<i>- Y'all say, "Diddly-dee."
- Diddly-dee.</i>

53:42.933 --> 53:44.764
<i>Oh!</i>

53:46.803 --> 53:49.271
I feel sick. All right. What else you got?
Show me some more.

53:50.507 --> 53:53.704
Okay. Okay.

53:53.810 --> 53:56.278
- You have to show me Benihana.
- Give it.

53:59.283 --> 54:01.274
<i># You ain't got the crime
'Cause she ain't got #</i>

54:01.385 --> 54:04.286
<i>#Nothing' on you #</i>

54:06.990 --> 54:09.652
<i>Aha!</i>

54:09.760 --> 54:11.751
Very pretty.
Do you feel pretty?

54:11.862 --> 54:15.025
<i>Adorable.</i>

54:15.999 --> 54:18.934
Every bride loves
her accessories.

54:19.036 --> 54:22.233
Men wore dresses. Women wore suits.

54:27.844 --> 54:31.143
Whoa!

54:35.719 --> 54:37.209
<i>- Kevin?
- Yup.</i>

54:37.321 --> 54:39.448
Oh!

54:39.556 --> 54:41.456
Um--

54:41.558 --> 54:43.719
What was the theme here?

54:43.827 --> 54:46.057
L.A. Wedding.

54:46.163 --> 54:49.257
<i># You gotta party
If you're feeling hearty #</i>

54:49.366 --> 54:52.597
<i>#She's in love now #</i>

54:59.876 --> 55:03.175
<i># Would you rather see #</i>

55:03.280 --> 55:07.478
<i># That you know
Yeah #</i>

55:07.584 --> 55:10.246
<i>#Come on #</i>

55:22.466 --> 55:25.526
Twenty-seven dresses.
You gotta be kidding me.

55:25.636 --> 55:28.833
I don't get it. All right. You--
You do the thing, you have the dress.

55:28.939 --> 55:31.339
Just throw it out.
That's a huge closet.

55:31.441 --> 55:33.534
You live in New York.
You cannot be eating up space like that.

55:33.644 --> 55:36.841
Strange as it sounds, I've had some
really good times in those dresses.

55:36.947 --> 55:38.972
- Weird as that may be.
- I don't believe you.

55:39.082 --> 55:41.482
<i>I don't care if somebody wants me
to wear a funny dress.</i>

55:41.585 --> 55:44.281
- It's their day, not mine.
- God bless you.

55:44.388 --> 55:46.948
<i>And if supporting them
when they get married means...</i>

55:47.057 --> 55:49.355
snowshoeing to a mountaintop
in the Alps or...

55:49.459 --> 55:53.156
<i>- helping to caulk a fountain
for some swans, then-
- You actually did that?</i>

55:53.263 --> 55:57.131
Oh, I'm a really,
very good caulker.

55:59.670 --> 56:02.696
Likes caulk.

56:02.806 --> 56:04.865
All right.
But come on. Seriously.

56:04.975 --> 56:07.569
I mean, how much time do you spend
doing this for other people?

56:07.678 --> 56:09.703
What about--What about you?
You don't have any needs?

56:09.813 --> 56:12.213
No, I don't.
I'm Jesus.

56:14.951 --> 56:18.478
Someday-- God knows when--
But someday...

56:18.588 --> 56:20.488
it'll be my day.

56:20.590 --> 56:23.286
<i>And then all those people
will be there for me. So--</i>

56:23.393 --> 56:25.554
<i>That is if I ever--</i>

56:25.662 --> 56:27.960
Sorry.

56:34.171 --> 56:36.071
You don't get it.

56:36.173 --> 56:38.107
<i>That's fine.
Why would you?</i>

57:07.204 --> 57:09.502
Hey. I need
your registry list.

57:09.606 --> 57:12.040
I thought you were
gonna wait downstairs.

57:15.712 --> 57:17.703
What is that?

57:17.814 --> 57:20.282
- George is in Telluride. Who's in here?
- No one.

57:20.383 --> 57:21.645
- Let's talk in the hall.
- Tess.

57:21.752 --> 57:24.243
Jane--

57:24.354 --> 57:26.413
He was looking for
a part-time job.

57:26.523 --> 57:29.424
He's...
cleaning the apartment.

57:29.526 --> 57:31.460
<i>- # Oh, boy #
- Look, don't tell George.</i>

57:31.561 --> 57:33.461
<i>It's Pedro
and my little secret, okay?</i>

57:33.563 --> 57:36.726
<i>#I don't really know
what I'm doing ##</i>

57:36.833 --> 57:38.494
Kevin!

57:38.602 --> 57:41.230
That bridesmaid story--
what do you have so far?

57:41.338 --> 57:44.102
Uh, it's a little rough.
I'm still workin' on it.

57:44.207 --> 57:46.175
- I want to see it.
- I'm not even--

57:46.276 --> 57:51.578
<i>- Right now. E-mail it.
- It's not-I'm not
finished with it. It's not done.</i>

57:59.556 --> 58:01.786
<i>Can you go away, please?
I did not invite you.</i>

58:01.892 --> 58:06.420
Well, luckily Tess did. When I cover
a wedding, I gotta see every aspect.

58:06.530 --> 58:09.158
You know, your sister wants so many
presents from so many stores...

58:09.266 --> 58:11.496
that she physically cannot register
for them all herself.

58:11.601 --> 58:14.502
She's pressed for time. It's a short engagement.

58:14.604 --> 58:16.663
Good God.
Another one?

58:16.773 --> 58:18.673
To you, it's just
another casserole dish.

58:18.775 --> 58:21.369
To Tess, it's the pot she's gonna
cook my mother's Christmas roast in.

58:21.478 --> 58:23.946
Oh, Tess cooks?

58:24.047 --> 58:26.413
All right. Well, I'm gonna cook it.
But Tess will be there...

58:26.516 --> 58:28.416
with George.

58:28.518 --> 58:30.543
- And this isn't just another "vahze."
- Vase.

58:30.654 --> 58:33.248
This is the "vahze"
that Tess will get out...

58:33.356 --> 58:37.087
when George brings home flowers,
just because he felt like it.

58:37.194 --> 58:39.389
I see. And this--

58:39.496 --> 58:44.297
this is the rooster-shaped umbrella holder
that will hold all of George's umbrellas.

58:44.401 --> 58:46.892
Fine. Be a jerk.

58:47.003 --> 58:49.972
All I'm saying
is that this isn't just stuff.

58:50.073 --> 58:52.303
<i>- These are the things
that make up a life together.
- No.</i>

58:52.409 --> 58:56.140
This is the useless crap that the
70-billion-dollar-a-year wedding industry...

58:56.246 --> 58:59.010
has convinced us all that we have
to have or we won't be happy.

58:59.115 --> 59:02.414
<i>You know what I think?
I think that all your statistics and theories...</i>

59:02.519 --> 59:04.544
are just
a smoke screen.

59:04.654 --> 59:08.055
- Oh, really? For what?
- Your little secret--whatever it is.

59:08.158 --> 59:11.059
Your parents got divorced.
You haven't found the right girl.

59:11.161 --> 59:13.425
- You're afraid you never will.
- Mm-hmm.

59:13.530 --> 59:15.430
And I think
you love weddings so much...

59:15.532 --> 59:19.366
because you'd rather focus on other people's
Kodak moments than make memories of your own.

59:19.469 --> 59:22.870
You're right. Know why? Because weddings are
the perfect place to forget about being single.

59:22.973 --> 59:25.498
I think you want a wedding--
not a marriage, a wedding.

59:25.609 --> 59:28.203
What is your problem?

59:28.311 --> 59:31.439
Did you have your own fancy wedding
and your wife left you or something?

59:32.682 --> 59:34.914
Bingo.

59:35.018 --> 59:36.918
What?

59:37.020 --> 59:38.920
With my roommate from college,
by the way.

59:39.022 --> 59:41.081
So I think you get
an extra bingo for that.

59:43.159 --> 59:46.185
Oh, shit.
Kevin, I'm--

59:46.296 --> 59:48.764
I'm so sorry. It was just--
It was a guess.

59:48.865 --> 59:50.765
<i>It was a good one.</i>

59:50.867 --> 59:53.700
For someone who has
no insight whatsoever into herself...

59:53.803 --> 59:55.703
you nailed me
right on the head.

59:57.474 --> 01:00:00.272
Want to find the ugliest stuff in the store
and register Tess for it?

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.480
Let's do it.

01:00:15.692 --> 01:00:17.592
Wow.

01:00:17.694 --> 01:00:20.322
<i>- I told you I was not done with it yet.
- No, it's good.</i>

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.625
I meant,
"Wow, it's actually decent."

01:00:22.732 --> 01:00:25.428
<i>I have to admit,
I was shocked...</i>

01:00:25.535 --> 01:00:29.301
<i>but, uh, it's smart
and, uh, biting...</i>

01:00:29.406 --> 01:00:31.306
and actually entertaining
as hell.

01:00:31.408 --> 01:00:34.400
<i>- Well, thank you.
- You really nailed this girl.</i>

01:00:34.511 --> 01:00:38.345
<i>We're running it Sunday,
front page of the section.</i>

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:41.781
Um, here is where you jump up
and down with gratitude.

01:00:41.885 --> 01:00:44.945
Oh-- No, no, no, no.
I just--

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:47.853
I just don't think it's perfect yet.
I really want to get this right.

01:00:47.958 --> 01:00:50.791
- We should just hold it a week.
- Wait. You've been begging me for months...

01:00:50.894 --> 01:00:54.091
and now you want me to hold the story
so you can move some commas around?

01:00:54.197 --> 01:00:57.257
I don't know. Now that I'm in it, she's more
than just this perpetual bridesmaid.

01:00:57.367 --> 01:01:00.495
You know, I don't know. There's--
There's a lot more to her than that.

01:01:00.603 --> 01:01:02.901
<i>Huh. If I didn't know you
any better...</i>

01:01:03.006 --> 01:01:05.668
I would say that you'd
developed a little crush.

01:01:05.775 --> 01:01:08.539
Very funny. Look, I know
I can make it better.

01:01:08.645 --> 01:01:12.103
- It's good the way it is.
- Will you just give me a week? Just a week.

01:01:12.215 --> 01:01:15.116
Fine. Get out.

01:01:20.857 --> 01:01:23.724
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:26.625
Oh, it's no problem.
I'm happy to help.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.597
And I have more experience eating
than Tess does, so you're in good hands.

01:01:29.699 --> 01:01:33.191
Now, we've planned your wedding dinner
to your exact specifications.

01:01:42.045 --> 01:01:44.309
-Jane's phone.
- Tess?

01:01:44.414 --> 01:01:47.542
- Hey, it's Kevin.
- Hey! How is the article coming?

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:51.051
Uh, I think it's gonna be a great piece.
I think you'll be very happy.

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:54.590
- I can't wait.
- Hey, listen. Any chance you know where Jane is?

01:01:54.691 --> 01:01:58.457
Yeah, you know, the thing that I like
about Tess is there's no bullshit.

01:01:58.561 --> 01:02:01.257
You know,
she's not afraid to be herself.

01:02:03.199 --> 01:02:06.828
George, about Tess--
There's something that I want to say.

01:02:06.936 --> 01:02:10.667
- Um--
- What?

01:02:13.543 --> 01:02:16.910
I'm just so happy for you,
that you found what you were looking for.

01:02:17.013 --> 01:02:20.073
All right.
So what's your favorite part...

01:02:20.183 --> 01:02:21.514
of a wedding?

01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:23.643
Oh, that's easy.

01:02:23.753 --> 01:02:26.313
You know when the music starts
and the bride makes her big entrance...

01:02:26.423 --> 01:02:27.890
and everybody turns
to look at her?

01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:30.755
That's when I look at the groom.
'Cause his face says it all.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.091
You know,
the pure love there.

01:02:34.197 --> 01:02:36.290
That's why I go.

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:39.266
<i>Okay. So when you get married
and you make your entrance...</i>

01:02:39.369 --> 01:02:41.269
I have full permission
to look at the groom?

01:02:41.371 --> 01:02:46.604
Yes. Please do. Please make sure the poor
sucker is still standing there.

01:02:46.709 --> 01:02:50.167
<i>Are you kidding me?
Some guy would be lucky to have you.</i>

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.148
<i>And the way that you attacked that
tomatillo before-- Who could resist that?</i>

01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.377
Very sexy.

01:03:03.393 --> 01:03:05.554
<i>Doyle?</i>

01:03:08.398 --> 01:03:10.298
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.094
What are you doing here?

01:03:14.204 --> 01:03:17.469
Are you guys picking out
the wedding meal?

01:03:17.574 --> 01:03:21.476
- Where's Tess?
- She's... getting her hair done.

01:03:22.579 --> 01:03:24.672
- I'm just helping out.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:27.716
We're heading up to Rhinebeck to pick out
some linens from an antique store.

01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:30.615
<i>Yeah, we really should go, because Tess
and I have dinner with my parents.</i>

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:34.178
- Well, why don't I just go with you?
- What? No. No. That's okay.

01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:37.987
Um, I can get you back on time.
I got my dad's Volvo, and that thing books.

01:03:38.094 --> 01:03:40.085
All right, look. I really don't mind.
It's totally fine.

01:03:40.196 --> 01:03:42.926
I got a couple more questions
to ask you anyway for the article.

01:03:43.032 --> 01:03:45.626
Which I'd be happy to answer,
by phone or e-mail.

01:03:45.735 --> 01:03:47.999
<i>If you wouldn't mind,
that would be a great help.</i>

01:03:48.104 --> 01:03:50.334
I don't mind at all.
I insist.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:58.870
It was like a lightbulb. The second I saw you
mooning at him over polenta.

01:03:58.982 --> 01:04:01.007
Of course you're upset.
You're planning your sister's wedding...

01:04:01.117 --> 01:04:03.017
to the man
that you're in love with.

01:04:03.119 --> 01:04:05.417
You're stuck in this
creepy little love triangle...

01:04:05.522 --> 01:04:08.719
and all the while, you're about
one monogrammed party favor away
from blowing your brains out.

01:04:08.825 --> 01:04:10.656
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.729
Oh, come on. Course you can't tell him
because you're Nice Jane, you're Sweet Jane.

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:15.855
You don't know
what you're talking about, okay?

01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:20.061
<i>He's my boss. She's my sister.
I am thrilled to be planning
their wedding-- tickled even.</i>

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.900
Like I have been for every wedding
that I've been a part of.

01:04:23.006 --> 01:04:25.907
But you can't understand that
because you're--

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:28.739
you're mean...
and dark and cynical.

01:04:28.845 --> 01:04:31.245
And, well, that's your problem,
pal, not mine.

01:04:31.347 --> 01:04:32.814
<i>- "Pal"? "Pal"?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.</i>

01:04:32.916 --> 01:04:35.817
"Hey, pal. Pal." This is bad.
You're calling me "pal."

01:04:35.919 --> 01:04:37.819
<i>Oh, will you just be quiet?</i>

01:04:39.622 --> 01:04:42.557
Look, I get it. You're mad.
I just ruined the whole afternoon...

01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:44.820
of you pining over somebody
that you'll never, ever have.

01:04:44.928 --> 01:04:47.328
Stop it!
Just stop.

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:52.058
Okay. Would you slow down just a little bit
so I can read this sign?

01:04:53.503 --> 01:04:55.994
Okay. My Spidey vision's
not working so good.

01:04:56.105 --> 01:04:59.336
- Do you think you could
slow down just a little bit?
- Would you leave me alone!

01:05:01.844 --> 01:05:04.176
Seriously. Crazy Lady,
we're gonna hydroplane. Slow down.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:06.009
Come on.
We are not gonna hydroplane.

01:05:06.115 --> 01:05:08.140
Whoa!

01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:10.947
Whoa! We're hydroplaning.
We're hydroplaning!

01:05:14.557 --> 01:05:17.253
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:19.590
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

01:05:25.034 --> 01:05:27.298
Don't say anything.

01:05:43.152 --> 01:05:45.052
- You got anything?
- No.

01:05:49.826 --> 01:05:52.659
- Uh--
- I said don't! Nothing.

01:06:07.744 --> 01:06:10.304
Excuse me.
Uh, your pay phone's dead.

01:06:10.413 --> 01:06:13.075
<i>Nice work. You're like one of those guys
on C.S.I.</i>

01:06:14.417 --> 01:06:16.715
Uh, any chance
we could use your phone?

01:06:16.819 --> 01:06:18.810
Could I get a scotch,
three fingers, no ice, please?

01:06:18.921 --> 01:06:21.185
<i>- What are you doing?
- Well, it's late...</i>

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:25.284
we're not getting a tow,
and we're in East Deliverance, New York.

01:06:25.395 --> 01:06:27.295
I'm gonna have a drink.

01:06:29.599 --> 01:06:31.499
Come on. There's nobody
you can help right now.

01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:35.196
Why don't you just sit down,
relax, have a drink? It's been a long day.

01:06:35.305 --> 01:06:37.102
Here you go.

01:06:38.975 --> 01:06:40.875
Fine.

01:06:42.078 --> 01:06:44.672
Just one!

01:06:45.882 --> 01:06:49.613
- Ah!
- Okay. February 12, 2006.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:54.815
The Keller wedding. You wrote a column
that moved me to tears.

01:06:54.924 --> 01:06:57.518
It was downright, flat-out the most beautiful
thing I have ever read.

01:06:57.627 --> 01:06:59.720
- Oh-- I don't remember it.
- How can you not remember that?

01:06:59.829 --> 01:07:01.729
- I don't remember it.
- How can you not?

01:07:01.831 --> 01:07:04.959
It was the anniversary of the father's death.
The brother flew home from Afghanistan.

01:07:05.068 --> 01:07:07.502
- You cannot fake emotion like that.
- Oh, yes, you can.

01:07:07.603 --> 01:07:11.039
- A good writer can.
- You're not that good.

01:07:12.141 --> 01:07:15.042
Nice!

01:07:17.547 --> 01:07:20.209
There's gotta be one thing
about weddings that you like.

01:07:22.385 --> 01:07:24.285
- Open bar.
- No.

01:07:25.988 --> 01:07:28.320
All right.

01:07:28.424 --> 01:07:32.588
So when the bride comes in
and she makes her giant, grand entrance--

01:07:32.695 --> 01:07:35.255
I like to glance back at the poor bastard
getting married.

01:07:36.366 --> 01:07:38.357
'Cause even though
I think he's an idiot...

01:07:38.468 --> 01:07:42.495
for willingly entering into the last
legal form of slavery...

01:07:44.607 --> 01:07:46.507
he always looks
really, really happy.

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:50.545
And, for some reason, I--

01:07:50.646 --> 01:07:53.547
What the hell are you
looking at me like that for?

01:07:53.649 --> 01:07:56.117
- Are you shitting me right now?
- What?

01:07:56.219 --> 01:07:58.949
<i>That's my favorite part.</i>

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:03.190
Oh, my God.
We have something in common.

01:08:05.161 --> 01:08:07.959
Yes. Well, statistically
that was bound to happen.

01:08:08.064 --> 01:08:10.658
Uh-huh. I think you should just admit
that you're a big softy.

01:08:10.767 --> 01:08:13.964
That this whole cynical thing
is just an act so that you can seem...

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:16.937
wounded and mysterious
and sexy.

01:08:17.038 --> 01:08:19.974
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that last one?
- What?

01:08:20.076 --> 01:08:21.975
- Did you say sexy?
- What?

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:24.569
- Do you think I'm sexy?
- No.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.738
- It's okay if you do. You think I'm sexy?
- I don't.

01:08:26.849 --> 01:08:29.647
<i>No. I think you think you're sexy.
That's the point I'm making.</i>

01:08:29.752 --> 01:08:32.482
<i>- You think I think I'm sexy?
- Yes.</i>

01:08:36.392 --> 01:08:39.384
- Great song.
- I love this song.

01:08:39.495 --> 01:08:42.930
# Hey, kids shake it loose-- a lemon #

01:08:43.032 --> 01:08:46.593
# Gotta make a feather #

01:08:46.702 --> 01:08:49.966
- Those are not the words.
- Those are exactly the words.

01:08:50.072 --> 01:08:52.734
Sorry, lyric police.
What are the words?

01:08:52.841 --> 01:08:55.810
#You're gonna hear
a handsome music #

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:58.243
# So the walrus sounds #

01:08:58.346 --> 01:09:00.247
"Walrus sounds"?

01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:03.910
- # Say, Penny's no longer in a cement jet #
- You're scaring me.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:06.648
# Ooh, but you're so
laced down #

01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:10.817
# Buh, buh, buh, buh
Bennie and the Jets #

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:13.919
# Ooh, in the wind
and the waterfall #

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:17.295
# Oh, baby,
she's a "revocaine" #

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.960
- # She's got electric boobs #
- Boobs?

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:23.698
- #And mohair shoes #
- #You know I read it in a magazine #

01:09:23.805 --> 01:09:25.706
# Oh-ho #

01:09:25.808 --> 01:09:30.541
<i>- I love this song.
- #B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets #</i>

01:09:35.718 --> 01:09:39.313
<i>#She's got electric boots a mohair suit #</i>

01:09:39.421 --> 01:09:42.185
<i># You know I read it
in a magazine #</i>

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.953
<i>#Oh-ho #</i>

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.325
<i>#B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets #</i>

01:09:50.131 --> 01:09:51.962
- # Bennie #
- # Bennie #

01:09:52.068 --> 01:09:53.729

01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:55.531

01:09:55.638 --> 01:09:58.698
# Bennie and the Jets #

01:10:04.347 --> 01:10:07.373
These guys are rockin'!

01:10:09.652 --> 01:10:11.552
That was cool!

01:10:19.128 --> 01:10:21.096
Whoa!

01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:25.433
I cried like a baby
at the Keller wedding.

01:10:34.243 --> 01:10:36.143
Mmm.

01:10:40.483 --> 01:10:42.383
Mmm.

01:11:07.577 --> 01:11:09.477
Morning, sunshine.

01:11:09.579 --> 01:11:11.877
- Hi.
- Here you go.

01:11:11.981 --> 01:11:15.144
- Thank you. Mmm.
- Tow truck's on its way.

01:11:15.251 --> 01:11:17.219
Okay.

01:11:19.422 --> 01:11:22.220
I just want you to know--
Well, you know, I never do this.

01:11:22.325 --> 01:11:26.227
- Oh, I know.
- No, really. Never. I never do this.

01:11:26.329 --> 01:11:29.196
Really, I know. Last night, you kept saying it,
over and over again.

01:11:29.298 --> 01:11:31.664
"I never do this. I never do this.
I never do this.

01:11:31.767 --> 01:11:34.065
- I never do this. I never--"
- Okay.

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:36.730
I just wanted you to know.

01:11:40.176 --> 01:11:43.509
Ah.

01:11:43.613 --> 01:11:46.810
<i>- No.
- No, I do. It's true.</i>

01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:48.816
- Here's your order.
- Thank you.

01:11:48.918 --> 01:11:51.148
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

01:11:51.253 --> 01:11:54.086
H-H-Hey! It's "Bennie and the Jets."

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:57.353
Re--
# B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets #

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.428
<i>#Bennie ##</i>

01:11:59.528 --> 01:12:03.157
- You guys-- Oh. That was awesome.
- Oh, thanks.

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:07.326
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Okay.

01:12:07.436 --> 01:12:10.462
Oh, my God. I sang "Bennie and the Jets"
last night, didn't I?

01:12:10.573 --> 01:12:12.939
Mm-hmm.
Very loudly.

01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:15.033
And, might I say,
you were a little pitchy.

01:12:15.144 --> 01:12:17.135
- I'm sorry. Me? What about you?
- Yes.

01:12:17.246 --> 01:12:19.646
- You hit notes only dogs can hear.
- What?

01:12:19.749 --> 01:12:24.743
- Truly. Truly high-pitched.
- No. I was in key, a-at least though, right?

01:12:24.854 --> 01:12:27.721
My God.
You're that girl.

01:12:27.823 --> 01:12:29.484
Yeah, I'm Bennie.
He's the Jets.

01:12:29.592 --> 01:12:32.561
Hey, it's the girl
from the paper.

01:12:32.662 --> 01:12:34.323
What paper?

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:38.023
Shit.

01:12:38.134 --> 01:12:41.194
<i>"Always, Always, Always
a Bridesmaid by Malcolm Doyle"?</i>

01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:44.471
What is this?

01:12:44.573 --> 01:12:46.837
Jane--

01:12:46.942 --> 01:12:49.410
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Let me--</i>

01:12:49.512 --> 01:12:51.707
<i>- Let me explain.
- Oh, my God.</i>

01:12:51.814 --> 01:12:53.145
Jane--

01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:58.152
Jane!

01:12:58.254 --> 01:13:00.518
Look, I told my editor
not to run it.

01:13:00.623 --> 01:13:02.523
Nobody reads
that section anyway.

01:13:02.625 --> 01:13:04.957
<i>Come on.
Will you please just-</i>

01:13:22.678 --> 01:13:24.873
What the hell happened?
You said you were gonna hold it.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:27.244
Well, you don't
make those decisions. I do.

01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:31.683
Oh, God. I didn't even get a chance to tell her
it was running. She was ambushed.

01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:33.721
Hey, I gave you
24 inches in the Sunday paper.

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:36.815
The only thing you should be saying to me
right now is "I love you."

01:13:46.569 --> 01:13:50.061
<i>- Oh! How could you let this happen to me?
- What?</i>

01:13:50.172 --> 01:13:53.835
"If Jane is the prototypical,
accommodating bridesmaid...

01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:58.607
"then her sister, Tess, is cast as the overbearing,
overindulged bride-to-be...

01:13:58.714 --> 01:14:02.309
"who at any moment, one worries,
might start stomping around Manhattan...

01:14:02.418 --> 01:14:05.751
breathing fire and swatting planes
from the sky."

01:14:05.855 --> 01:14:08.449
I had no idea he was writing
an article about me.

01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:12.994
<i>You? He called me "Bridezilla"
in the New York Frickin' Journal!</i>

01:14:13.095 --> 01:14:16.929
I could tear him apart, I swear.
I could tear him apart limb from limb.

01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:22.400
- What?
- Can I speak to Jane, please?

01:14:22.505 --> 01:14:27.067
The only person that you're
gonna be speaking to is my attorney!

01:14:27.176 --> 01:14:29.736
And I don't even have an attorney,
but I'm sure gonna get one!

01:14:29.845 --> 01:14:32.575
Asshole!

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:36.950
I gotta get outta here.

01:14:37.052 --> 01:14:39.748
Oh, but you better alert
Traffic Control...

01:14:39.855 --> 01:14:41.755
because Bridezilla's
on the loose!

01:14:53.335 --> 01:14:55.394
Kevin-- Kevin--

01:14:55.504 --> 01:14:58.905
Kevin, stop calling me!

01:15:05.214 --> 01:15:09.378
Before you say anything,
can you just not say anything?

01:15:11.153 --> 01:15:13.144
I don't understand.

01:15:13.255 --> 01:15:15.621
To what are you referring?

01:15:16.692 --> 01:15:18.683
<i>Oh, come on.
It's no big deal.</i>

01:15:18.794 --> 01:15:22.127
It's just an article...
on the front page of the section...

01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:24.722
<i>with a million pictures
of you on it.</i>

01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:27.394
<i>- Who's upset?
- Jane.</i>

01:15:36.145 --> 01:15:39.205
Let me just explain.
I had no idea what he was writing.

01:15:39.315 --> 01:15:42.876
- I would--
-Jane, the guy was a jerk.
Okay? He took advantage of you.

01:15:42.985 --> 01:15:46.284
- Don't worry about it.
- I know. I just-- I feel
like I should've seen it coming.

01:15:46.388 --> 01:15:49.653
- I'm so sorry.
- Would you please stop apologizing?

01:15:49.758 --> 01:15:53.751
The only reason I called you in here was
to make sure that you're okay.

01:15:54.897 --> 01:15:58.856
Oh.
Well, I've been better.

01:16:00.269 --> 01:16:02.999
I'm just trying
to get through it.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:05.039
Look. I wouldn't
worry about it, all right?

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.735
- Does anybody read that section anyhow?
- No.

01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:17.010
<i>So after we hem it, I wouldn't--</i>

01:16:17.119 --> 01:16:19.451
<i>-Jane, is that you?
- Yep.</i>

01:16:19.555 --> 01:16:21.887
- We'll talk about it after. Hi.
- Hi.

01:16:21.991 --> 01:16:23.515
- Hi, Sue.
- Hi.

01:16:23.626 --> 01:16:26.618
So, listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the article fiasco...

01:16:26.729 --> 01:16:28.629
and I've decided
to forgive you.

01:16:28.731 --> 01:16:30.756
- Mmm.
- You're just very trusting...

01:16:30.866 --> 01:16:32.993
- and it's not your fault, I guess.
- Mm-kay.

01:16:33.102 --> 01:16:35.036
That's very big of you, Tess.
Thank you.

01:16:35.137 --> 01:16:37.537
Wait. Are you
checking me off your list?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.438
Um, about the slide show,
I know exactly what I want you to say.

01:16:40.542 --> 01:16:43.943
So I wrote out a script. And Dad says
that you have all the family photos.

01:16:44.046 --> 01:16:46.241
- Yep. Mm-hmm.
- So I'm gonna send you George's as well.

01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:51.251
Um, here. Please say this
and only this.

01:16:51.353 --> 01:16:54.948
- 'Cause we don't want to be embarrassed again.
- Okay. You got it.

01:16:55.057 --> 01:16:57.116
Here it is.

01:16:57.226 --> 01:16:59.786
- Step in.
- Okay.

01:16:59.895 --> 01:17:01.795
- Yep.
- There you go.

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:06.468
<i>- It's beautiful.
- You might have to unbutton that back.</i>

01:17:06.568 --> 01:17:09.401
- One second.
- Okay.

01:17:11.006 --> 01:17:13.975
Perfect.
So what do you think?

01:17:15.778 --> 01:17:17.803
I-- I thought
you were wearing Mom's dress.

01:17:17.913 --> 01:17:21.747
It is Mom's dress.
Well, parts of it.

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:26.617
<i>It was just so old-fashioned,you know?
So we could just use a few pieces here and there.</i>

01:17:26.722 --> 01:17:28.917
- Parts?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:31.424
Like this,
and the lace.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.934
You cut up
Mom's wedding dress?

01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:42.697
Well, technically Mary-Ella did.

01:17:44.306 --> 01:17:46.171
But don't worry.
We saved you the rest.

01:17:46.275 --> 01:17:48.766
<i>And, I mean,
if you want,you can wear this...</i>

01:17:48.877 --> 01:17:52.643
<i>as long as a silhouette's
still in fashion.</i>

01:17:52.748 --> 01:17:56.275
<i>Mary-Ella, I think just the bottom
needs to be hemmed a little bit.</i>

01:17:56.385 --> 01:17:58.649
No. No, no, no, no.

01:17:58.754 --> 01:18:01.382
No!

01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:04.186
Okay, fine.
You don't have to wear it.

01:18:04.293 --> 01:18:06.853
God, you don't care. You don't care
about anyone but yourself, do you?

01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:10.295
I have made excuses for you because Mom
died when you were little. But enough is enough!

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:13.334
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:18:13.435 --> 01:18:15.995
I can't undo what you've just done.
But I won't let you hurt George.

01:18:16.105 --> 01:18:19.472
He thinks he knows the truth about you,
but all he knows are the lies you've told him.

01:18:19.575 --> 01:18:22.408
You even had Pedro
keep a secret from George.

01:18:22.511 --> 01:18:24.502
You tell him the truth
right now!

01:18:24.613 --> 01:18:27.741
He is not one of your Eurotrash boyfriends,
Tess. He is a good person.

01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:30.512
And you cannot start a relationship
based on lies.

01:18:30.619 --> 01:18:34.885
Oh, really,Jane? And you know this
because of all your successful relationships?

01:18:36.425 --> 01:18:38.484
You tell him the truth,
or I will.

01:18:38.594 --> 01:18:42.496
No, you won't. You wouldn't hurt a fly.
And you definitely wouldn't hurt me.

01:18:42.598 --> 01:18:45.260
- I'm your sister.
- That was yesterday.

01:18:45.367 --> 01:18:48.825
Today you're just some bitch who broke my
heart and cut up my mother's wedding dress.

01:18:50.506 --> 01:18:52.565
Well, it wouldn't have
fit you anyway.

01:19:12.694 --> 01:19:15.254
Oh,Jane.
You look wonderful.

01:19:15.364 --> 01:19:17.264
Good for you.

01:19:17.366 --> 01:19:21.735
Oh, honey, it must be so hard to watch
your younger sister get married before you.

01:19:21.837 --> 01:19:24.203
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:19:24.306 --> 01:19:27.673
But then I remember that I still get to have
hot hate sex with random strangers...

01:19:27.776 --> 01:19:30.301
and I feel so much better.

01:19:30.412 --> 01:19:32.312
Enjoy the party.

01:19:34.783 --> 01:19:37.616
Whoo! You clean up good.
I might even be into you.

01:19:37.719 --> 01:19:41.655
- Okay. It's on the desktop
under "Tess and George."
- Okay.

01:19:41.757 --> 01:19:43.657
- You okay?
- Yep.

01:19:45.027 --> 01:19:48.121
That's not water.
Okay.

01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:50.130
Okay.

01:19:52.801 --> 01:19:55.463
<i>Hi.</i>

01:19:55.571 --> 01:19:58.631
-Jane, thank you so much for
doing all this. It's great.
- Sure.

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.765
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- Yeah. Oh, look. Pigs in a blanket.

01:20:00.876 --> 01:20:06.314
- Want one, Tess?
- No. I don't eat that stuff,Jane.

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:12.153
Right.
That's right. Got it.

01:20:17.126 --> 01:20:19.959
Well, I'm gonna go
do the slide show.

01:20:20.062 --> 01:20:22.087
-Jane.
- Mmm?

01:20:23.565 --> 01:20:25.658
You're only gonna
say what I wrote, right?

01:20:25.767 --> 01:20:29.259
Of course. The perfect bridesmaid
always does what she's asked.

01:20:38.814 --> 01:20:40.805
Not getting cold feet, are you?

01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:43.043
- What was that?
- With this one? Never.

01:20:45.521 --> 01:20:47.614
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

01:20:47.723 --> 01:20:49.623
<i>In case you haven't
already read...</i>

01:20:49.725 --> 01:20:52.455
I have been to
my fair share of weddings.

01:20:55.297 --> 01:20:57.527
<i>So, to start things off...</i>

01:20:57.633 --> 01:21:00.534
I thought you should all know the truth
about Tess and George.

01:21:07.342 --> 01:21:11.142
<i>"Tess and George
are a perfect couple.</i>

01:21:11.246 --> 01:21:13.441
"No, a divine couple.

01:21:13.549 --> 01:21:15.847
"A couple whose love
is the stuff of myths.

01:21:15.951 --> 01:21:18.511
"Their compatibility
is so exact...

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.750
"that it can only be described
as having been designed by the gods.

01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:26.157
<i>Since a picture is worth a thousand words...</i>

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.196
I put together a slide show
so you can all see for yourselves.

01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:38.369
<i>"From the very beginning, Tess and George
were destined for each other.</i>

01:21:42.678 --> 01:21:46.170
<i>"George and Tess have always shared a love
of God's furry creatures.</i>

01:21:49.818 --> 01:21:54.949
<i>"As they grew up, they both shared the same
level of dedication and commitment...</i>

01:21:55.057 --> 01:21:58.458
"to their education.

01:22:01.396 --> 01:22:04.888
<i>- Nice.
- "And civic responsibility.</i>

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.026
<i>- #So happy together #
- Oh, my.</i>

01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:13.099
<i>"He was interested
in international affairs.</i>

01:22:14.843 --> 01:22:16.242
"And so was she.

01:22:16.345 --> 01:22:19.280
<i>Whoa.</i>

01:22:19.381 --> 01:22:23.442
<i>"And today, Tess and George
still share the same values.</i>

01:22:25.187 --> 01:22:28.554
<i>#Me and you
and you and me #</i>

01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:31.956
<i>"Their love is based
on a deep understanding...</i>

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:36.429
<i>"and acceptance of who
the other person really is.</i>

01:22:36.531 --> 01:22:41.400
<i>#So happy together #</i>

01:22:41.503 --> 01:22:44.301
<i>#Bah, bah, bah, bah #</i>

01:22:47.242 --> 01:22:50.803
<i>"The love of
two true soul mates...</i>

01:22:50.912 --> 01:22:53.380
"Tess and George.

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.613
<i>So here's to the most perfect couple
brought together by destiny.</i>

01:23:02.724 --> 01:23:04.885
I'm so proud of you, Baby Sister.

01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:09.192
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

01:23:09.298 --> 01:23:12.131
All right.
Well, that was--

01:23:12.234 --> 01:23:15.761
<i>Yeah. So, um...</i>

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:20.365
to keep the merriment going,
um, George's "little brother" Pedro...

01:23:20.475 --> 01:23:22.204
<i>wanted to say
a few words.</i>

01:23:22.311 --> 01:23:24.302
<i>Pedro.</i>

01:23:24.413 --> 01:23:27.382
So, safe to say you're not a vegetarian.

01:23:27.482 --> 01:23:30.974
George, that was taken
a really long time ago.

01:23:31.086 --> 01:23:33.884
Why exactly were you wearing
your engagement ring then?

01:23:33.989 --> 01:23:35.889
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:23:35.991 --> 01:23:37.822
As all you know,
George is my big brother.

01:23:37.926 --> 01:23:40.486
But he's more than that.

01:23:40.595 --> 01:23:42.495
<i>He's my best friend.</i>

01:23:42.597 --> 01:23:47.034
<i>And now George has Tess, who's-
who's really-really, really cool...</i>

01:23:47.135 --> 01:23:50.798
'cause she's gonna help me start
my own cleaning business.

01:23:50.906 --> 01:23:54.000
<i>Oh. Tess told me
not to tell you, George.</i>

01:23:54.109 --> 01:23:56.202
<i>But I'm so excited.</i>

01:23:56.311 --> 01:23:58.506
<i>So I'm only doing
George's place right now.</i>

01:23:58.613 --> 01:24:02.140
<i>But if anyone is in the market for
a really good cleaning service...</i>

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:04.878
please see me
in the lobby.

01:24:04.986 --> 01:24:07.045
Thank you.

01:24:07.155 --> 01:24:10.215
- That's great.
- No, it's-- it's not. George.

01:24:12.260 --> 01:24:16.754
<i>George, wait, please.
Let me explain.</i>

01:24:17.866 --> 01:24:20.096
So what happened?

01:24:22.003 --> 01:24:25.871
<i>- He needed to know the truth.
- You could've told him face-to-face.</i>

01:24:25.974 --> 01:24:29.501
I mean, I know that my moral compass
doesn't exactly point due north...

01:24:29.611 --> 01:24:33.945
but if I say something's wrong,
something's wrong.

01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:39.186
You're the one who is always telling me
to stand up for myself.

01:24:39.287 --> 01:24:41.881
<i>Yeah. But that's
not what you did.</i>

01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:45.084
What you did was unleash 20 years
of repressed feelings in one night.

01:24:45.193 --> 01:24:47.093
It was entertaining--
don't get me wrong--

01:24:47.195 --> 01:24:50.858
<i>but if it was the right thing to do,
you'd feel better right now.</i>

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:54.368
Do you feel better
right now?

01:24:57.038 --> 01:25:00.405
The wedding's off.
I hope you're happy.

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:31.596
Oh, God. What?

01:25:31.706 --> 01:25:33.606
Why are you here?

01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:36.233
- You wouldn't return my phone calls.
- What do you want?

01:25:36.344 --> 01:25:38.574
You want another picture
for your paper?

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.174
-Jane, I'm sorry. Believe me.
- Please. You used me to get ahead in your career.

01:25:43.285 --> 01:25:45.651
Be a man and admit it.
Or-- Or don't.

01:25:45.754 --> 01:25:49.121
But please, please don't pretend
that you give a shit.

01:25:49.224 --> 01:25:51.954
- Will you just please let me explain?
- No, it doesn't matter.

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:56.554
I just destroyed my life,
and I didn't need your help to do it.

01:25:56.665 --> 01:25:59.031
Great! Finally.

01:25:59.134 --> 01:26:02.297
I saw what you did in there.
And you know what? I thought it was amazing.

01:26:02.404 --> 01:26:05.635
Was it absolutely, certifiably nuts?
Yes, it was. But you did something,Jane.

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:09.073
<i>- For the first time,you were not
just the perfect bridesmaid.
- Stop.Just please.</i>

01:26:09.177 --> 01:26:12.806
I'm not doing this with you again. I don't even
know why I'm standing here talking to you.

01:26:12.914 --> 01:26:15.815
You know what? Let me tell you. Look.
Come here. Listen to me.

01:26:15.917 --> 01:26:19.284
Do you want to know the real
reason why I came here tonight?

01:26:19.387 --> 01:26:21.412
Because I knew this was
gonna be hard for you.

01:26:21.523 --> 01:26:25.687
And for the first time in a really long time,
I wanted to be there for somebody. Yeah.

01:26:25.794 --> 01:26:29.195
All right. I messed up.
I did. I'm sorry.

01:26:29.297 --> 01:26:31.697
And I'm gonna turn around,
I'm gonna walk away. I'm gonna vanish.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.769
You'll never see me again,
I promise.

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:37.964
But I want you to know
that I think you deserve--

01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:41.372
I think you deserve more
than what you've settled for.

01:26:41.476 --> 01:26:45.810
I do. I think you deserve to be
taken care of for a change.

01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:48.007
I-- I believe that.

01:26:58.693 --> 01:27:00.593
Ah.

01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:03.391
I forgot to give you this.

01:27:03.498 --> 01:27:06.365
<i>It's a gift...</i>

01:27:06.468 --> 01:27:10.063
so you don't have to carry around that
crazy Filofax from 1987.

01:27:10.171 --> 01:27:13.902
This will take care of all
the stuff you need to do.

01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:17.103
Perfect for starting over.

01:27:23.251 --> 01:27:26.516
Okay. Will you take it, please,
so I don't feel like such a jerk?

01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:52.646
<i>#Don't let your mind
get weary and confused #</i>

01:27:52.747 --> 01:27:57.184
<i># Your will be still
Don't try #</i>

01:28:04.192 --> 01:28:09.459
<i>#Don't let your heart
get heavy, child, inside you #</i>

01:28:09.564 --> 01:28:12.795
<i># There's a strength
that lies #</i>

01:28:18.406 --> 01:28:20.966
The story got
a phenomenal response.

01:28:21.076 --> 01:28:24.204
- Looks like you got yourself
bumped from Commitments.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.946
That's great.

01:28:28.049 --> 01:28:30.540
Kevin, be happy.

01:28:30.652 --> 01:28:33.177
You got what you wanted, right?

01:28:33.288 --> 01:28:37.349
<i>#Don't let your soul
get lonely, child #</i>

01:28:37.459 --> 01:28:42.487
<i>#It's only time
it will go by ##</i>

01:28:46.234 --> 01:28:48.759
<i>All I'm saying is
you two are sisters.</i>

01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:51.930
- You have got to work this out.
- I'm telling you, she doesn't want to talk.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.407
No, no. She loves you.
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:57.774
- Okay. If you just--
- Dad?

01:29:02.183 --> 01:29:04.151
What the hell
is she doing here?

01:29:04.252 --> 01:29:06.311
Tess, this is
between you and her.

01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:08.321
I'm out of this.

01:29:08.423 --> 01:29:13.019
You know, Flo, have you seen the new
weed whackers we've got out front?

01:29:13.128 --> 01:29:15.995
<i>The latest model.</i>

01:29:20.135 --> 01:29:22.831
I feel terrible.

01:29:22.937 --> 01:29:26.304
<i>- I'm so sorry for what happened--
- Sorry?</i>

01:29:26.408 --> 01:29:29.605
You humiliated me in front
of every single person that I know...

01:29:29.711 --> 01:29:31.679
and you think
you could just say sorry?

01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:35.216
<i>- I-I know. But--
- Jane,you were always jealous of me.</i>

01:29:35.316 --> 01:29:38.513
- What?
- Always! My clothes! My boyfriends!

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.487
- Stop it!
- You've just been waiting
for the chance to tear me down.

01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:43.022
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is!

01:29:43.124 --> 01:29:46.855
- Ow!
- And you took the one thing
that was finally working out.

01:29:46.961 --> 01:29:48.861
Oh, please!
This is so typical, Tess.

01:29:48.963 --> 01:29:52.330
You're not taking any responsibility
for the fact that you lied to George.

01:29:52.434 --> 01:29:54.334
You manipulated him.
Put down the bug spray.

01:29:54.436 --> 01:29:57.496
Put down the bug spray, Tess!

01:29:57.605 --> 01:30:00.233
Did you even love him?
Or was it just convenient?

01:30:00.341 --> 01:30:03.572
Oh, please,Jane.
Get off your high horse.

01:30:03.678 --> 01:30:05.612
<i>Just admit it.
You resent me...</i>

01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:08.182
because you're the one who
always had to braid my hair...

01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:12.117
and make my Halloween outfits
and go shopping for my prom dress.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.916
- No, I have never resented any of that.
- Yes, you have.

01:30:15.023 --> 01:30:17.856
- You always thought that my life was so easy.
- It was!

01:30:17.959 --> 01:30:20.257
It is! You have never
had a care in the world.

01:30:20.361 --> 01:30:23.455
You're beautiful
and fun and charming.

01:30:23.565 --> 01:30:26.090
- Your life is perfect.
- Perfect? Are you crazy?

01:30:26.201 --> 01:30:28.101
You have no idea.

01:30:28.203 --> 01:30:31.195
You want to know the real reason
why I decided to stay in New York?

01:30:31.306 --> 01:30:34.207
I got fired from my job.

01:30:34.309 --> 01:30:36.209
And to top it off,
Rudolfo dumped me.

01:30:36.311 --> 01:30:39.337
He dumped me.

01:30:39.447 --> 01:30:42.439
And then George came along,
and he was nice to me.

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:45.041
And he treated me well,
you know?

01:30:45.153 --> 01:30:49.556
And I just wanted to be
someone that he wanted.

01:30:49.657 --> 01:30:52.125
<i>I was trying to be someone
who deserved him...</i>

01:30:52.227 --> 01:30:55.560
someone he could respect.

01:30:55.663 --> 01:30:58.325
I was trying to be you.

01:31:00.034 --> 01:31:02.059
Why?

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.139
Why would you want to be me
when you get to be you?

01:31:07.776 --> 01:31:11.974
<i>- This is a mess.
- I know.</i>

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:15.447
Jane, you've been trying to take care of me
ever since Mom died.

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.314
- I had to.
- No, you didn't have to.

01:31:19.754 --> 01:31:22.484
- But-- But if I don't then--
- But if you don't...

01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:26.822
then you'll just be my sister,
which is what it should be.

01:31:26.928 --> 01:31:29.863
Maybe when I was young
you needed to help me out. But now?

01:31:29.964 --> 01:31:31.955
You gotta stop
taking care of me...

01:31:32.066 --> 01:31:34.466
of everybody.

01:32:25.787 --> 01:32:27.812
Hello? Hi.

01:32:29.324 --> 01:32:31.258
Yeah.

01:32:31.359 --> 01:32:33.259
Yeah. It's no problem.
No, of course.

01:32:33.361 --> 01:32:36.489
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Okay. Okay, bye.

01:32:50.345 --> 01:32:52.609
Wow.

01:32:52.714 --> 01:32:55.547
You look--
You look great.

01:32:57.151 --> 01:33:01.019
So I guess you did need to find me a date
for this benefit after all.

01:33:01.122 --> 01:33:03.056
I guess so.

01:33:03.157 --> 01:33:05.785
George, before we go anywhere,
I just want to apologize for last night.

01:33:05.894 --> 01:33:07.794
I shouldn't have done
what I did.

01:33:07.896 --> 01:33:09.989
Look, you did me a favor.

01:33:10.098 --> 01:33:13.124
All right, it's not your fault I was about
to marry someone I barely knew.

01:33:13.234 --> 01:33:15.828
<i>I mean, what the hell
was I thinking, right?</i>

01:33:17.872 --> 01:33:21.569
- So what do you say we forget the whole thing?
- Okay. If you're sure.

01:33:21.676 --> 01:33:24.907
I'm sure. Now, I hate to ask you
for another favor...

01:33:25.013 --> 01:33:28.244
but I need to print up my speech for tonight,
and I cannot find the file.

01:33:28.349 --> 01:33:30.647
Oh, yeah.
I can get it.

01:33:30.752 --> 01:33:34.483
Jane, I am so thankful
that I could call you tonight.

01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:38.286
I can always count on you.
You never say no.

01:33:38.393 --> 01:33:40.827
Which I love.

01:33:42.664 --> 01:33:44.894
What?

01:33:44.999 --> 01:33:47.991
Well, I-- I just meant--

01:33:48.102 --> 01:33:50.002
I'm sorry. Did I--
Did I say something wrong?

01:33:52.807 --> 01:33:55.332
Oh, God.

01:33:55.443 --> 01:33:58.173
George, I quit.

01:33:58.279 --> 01:34:00.179
Yeah.

01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:02.749
<i>- I quit.
- What do you mean, you quit?</i>

01:34:02.850 --> 01:34:06.013
When I came here after college, I was
blown away by this company and by you.

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.749
And I got so caught up in the job
that I never bothered to get my own life.

01:34:09.857 --> 01:34:11.757
I think I got
too comfortable to leave.

01:34:11.859 --> 01:34:15.852
Then I had to be here every day to see you
because I was so madly in love with you.

01:34:18.199 --> 01:34:20.099
Yeah.
Horrible.

01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:23.102
Crazy-- Crazy crush.
Crazy.

01:34:25.006 --> 01:34:27.031
But you'll be fine,
George.

01:34:27.141 --> 01:34:29.371
You will. You'll get somebody
in this position...

01:34:29.477 --> 01:34:33.846
who will stay for two years max,
because that's what's acceptable
and appropriate for this--

01:34:45.393 --> 01:34:47.293
I-- I'm sorry.
Really sorry.

01:34:47.395 --> 01:34:51.058
- I don't know. It just
kind of, like, all of a sudden.
- No. It's okay.

01:34:51.165 --> 01:34:54.225
I've always wanted to know
what that would feel like.

01:34:54.335 --> 01:34:57.133
And?

01:34:57.238 --> 01:34:59.798
- Nothin'. I didn't feel a thing.
- Ouch.

01:34:59.907 --> 01:35:02.432
That hurts.

01:35:02.543 --> 01:35:05.376
- May-Maybe we can give it another try. Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:35:12.854 --> 01:35:14.879
Nope.
Not even a blip. You?

01:35:14.989 --> 01:35:18.356
Mmm. If I'm being honest,
not really.

01:35:18.459 --> 01:35:21.519
Yeah. That's not what it's
supposed to feel like.

01:35:21.629 --> 01:35:23.620
When you're with the person
you're meant to be with...

01:35:23.731 --> 01:35:25.722
<i>it should feel like--</i>

01:35:25.833 --> 01:35:27.801
Wait. What is that?

01:35:34.342 --> 01:35:36.276
I gotta go.

01:35:39.881 --> 01:35:42.873
<i>How many sick days do you think we
can really take without getting in trouble?</i>

01:35:42.984 --> 01:35:47.580
If we took four in a row, we could take a whole
week off and go down to, like, Cancun.

01:35:47.688 --> 01:35:49.588
Excuse me.
Hello?

01:35:49.690 --> 01:35:52.625
Do you know where Kev--
um, Malcolm-- Malcolm Doyle is?

01:35:52.727 --> 01:35:54.627
Yeah. He's covering
his last wedding.

01:35:54.729 --> 01:35:57.562
H-Hey. You're the girl from the article.
You're famous.

01:35:57.665 --> 01:35:59.724
Yeah.

01:35:59.834 --> 01:36:01.734
Taxi?

01:36:09.644 --> 01:36:11.908
Pier 17.

01:36:13.081 --> 01:36:14.981
Oh, my God.

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:17.449
<i>Only got one dress tonight, Ziggy.
So just go.</i>

01:36:17.552 --> 01:36:20.817
<i>- Oh, come on! Oh, c-- Oh.
- Just go!</i>

01:36:29.530 --> 01:36:32.226
- Good luck!
- Thanks, Ziggy.

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:34.426
- Where's the wedding? Okay.
- Straight down to the end.

01:36:38.372 --> 01:36:40.363
Oh, good. Well, I got it.
Thank you very much.

01:36:40.475 --> 01:36:42.375
- Mm-hmm. You're welcome.
- Appreciate it.

01:36:46.347 --> 01:36:48.679
<i>Hey, pull it back!</i>

01:36:48.783 --> 01:36:50.444
All clear!

01:37:03.297 --> 01:37:05.231
Huh.

01:37:09.937 --> 01:37:11.837
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:37:11.939 --> 01:37:14.772
<i>- You okay?
- I'm fine. Really.</i>

01:37:14.876 --> 01:37:16.776
It's all good.

01:37:24.252 --> 01:37:27.551
Oh, my God. No way!
No freaking way!

01:37:27.655 --> 01:37:29.816
You're the girl
from the article.

01:37:29.924 --> 01:37:31.824
What--What are you
doing here?

01:37:31.926 --> 01:37:34.986
Um, well--
Okay.

01:37:35.096 --> 01:37:38.293
Long story short.
There's this guy.

01:37:38.399 --> 01:37:41.630
- Oh! Okay. Tell me more. Tell me more.
- Um--

01:37:43.504 --> 01:37:45.404
<i>Kevin?</i>

01:37:45.506 --> 01:37:49.704
<i>Kevin Doyle?</i>

01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:51.710
Oh, my God.

01:37:51.812 --> 01:37:53.507
There he is.
There he is.

01:37:53.614 --> 01:37:55.912
<i>Um- hi.</i>

01:37:56.017 --> 01:37:59.214
<i>Uh-
Um-</i>

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.254
- Come on. You can do it. Say it.
- Okay.

01:38:01.355 --> 01:38:04.518
Uh, I just wanted to say...

01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:07.025
that you were right about me,
about all of it.

01:38:07.128 --> 01:38:10.529
I just didn't want to hear it,
especially not from you.

01:38:10.631 --> 01:38:12.531
<i>Uh-
Um-</i>

01:38:13.834 --> 01:38:15.734
Can we get
a follow spot?

01:38:17.471 --> 01:38:20.406
<i>Ah.
There you are.</i>

01:38:20.508 --> 01:38:22.408
<i>Um, okay.</i>

01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:25.911
Uh, Kevin, I've been waiting my whole life
for the right guy to come along...

01:38:26.013 --> 01:38:28.243
and then you showed up.

01:38:28.349 --> 01:38:30.510
And you are nothing like
the man I imagined.

01:38:30.618 --> 01:38:32.882
You're cynical...

01:38:32.987 --> 01:38:36.787
and cranky
and impossible.

01:38:36.891 --> 01:38:40.327
<i>But the truth is,
fighting with you...</i>

01:38:40.428 --> 01:38:42.521
<i>is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.</i>

01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:46.862
And I think there's a very good chance
that I'm falling in love with you.

01:38:49.804 --> 01:38:54.434
So... that's it.

01:38:54.542 --> 01:38:58.535
That's all I had to say.
So... I'll go now.

01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:04.316
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:39:08.389 --> 01:39:10.482
Yeah.

01:39:10.591 --> 01:39:13.617
Kevin, I just really, um--

01:39:18.666 --> 01:39:21.328
Get over here.

01:39:34.849 --> 01:39:38.876
<i>#I wonder why it is #</i>

01:39:38.986 --> 01:39:43.286
<i>#I don't argue like this #</i>

01:39:43.391 --> 01:39:48.385
<i># With anyone but you #</i>

01:39:50.464 --> 01:39:54.423
<i>#I wonder why it is #</i>

01:39:54.535 --> 01:39:58.734
<i>#I won't let my guard down #</i>

01:39:58.839 --> 01:40:01.899
<i>#For anyone but you ##</i>

01:40:02.009 --> 01:40:05.069
So-- Tell me, what do you think
makes this wedding special?

01:40:05.179 --> 01:40:08.910
<i>- Who are you?
- I write the Commitments column for the Journal.</i>

01:40:09.016 --> 01:40:11.610
- Maybe I could buy you a drink later.
- It's an open bar.

01:40:11.719 --> 01:40:14.688
<i>- Maybe I'll buy you a drink.
- Yes!</i>

01:40:14.789 --> 01:40:17.314
- Hi.
- Thank you.

01:40:19.627 --> 01:40:21.561
God, look at
how hot Tess looks.

01:40:22.663 --> 01:40:25.689
<i>Think she'd go for me?
I am a year older.</i>

01:40:25.800 --> 01:40:29.258
I don't know. I'll put in the good word
for you, big guy. All right?

01:40:31.806 --> 01:40:34.001
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:40:34.108 --> 01:40:37.737
Um, I'm the maid of honor.

01:40:37.845 --> 01:40:41.144
I, um, live in Williamsburg
with a roommate...

01:40:41.248 --> 01:40:45.207
and I just started designing my own line
of deeply fabulous handbags.

01:40:45.319 --> 01:40:48.652
And I'm completely broke.
But that's okay.

01:40:48.756 --> 01:40:53.693
I eat a hamburger a day,
and my idea of a pet is a rock.

01:40:54.795 --> 01:40:57.423
- Well, it's very nice to meet you.
- Tess.

01:40:57.531 --> 01:41:00.500
Tess. Got it.

01:41:00.601 --> 01:41:03.365
Well, wait until you see the bride.
She looks gorgeous.

01:41:07.108 --> 01:41:09.406
Ready?

01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:11.410
Everything's perfect.

01:41:11.512 --> 01:41:14.811
And this dress-- the best thing is I can
shorten it and wear it again.

01:41:14.915 --> 01:41:16.815
Definitely. So true.

01:41:16.917 --> 01:41:19.181
All right.

01:41:19.286 --> 01:41:21.948
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:41:22.056 --> 01:41:24.251
Okay. Ready?

01:41:24.358 --> 01:41:26.258
Yes.

01:41:52.653 --> 01:41:56.282
<i>That day, I woke up
and put on my 28th dress.</i>

01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:59.450
<i>I went to a wedding where no one asked me
to hold the bouquet...</i>

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.894
<i>fold a place card or hold their dress
while they peed.</i>

01:42:03.998 --> 01:42:06.796
<i>Everything was perfect.
And I didn't care...</i>

01:42:06.901 --> 01:42:10.337
<i>because right then,
the only thing that mattered...</i>

01:42:10.438 --> 01:42:14.067
<i>was the person waiting for me
at the end of the aisle.</i>

01:42:14.175 --> 01:42:16.939
<i>And he was looking at me
the way I'd always hoped.</i>

01:42:32.426 --> 01:42:34.587
So is this moment
everything you hoped for?

01:42:36.297 --> 01:42:37.764
No.

01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:42.633
It's more.
It's much more.

01:42:44.271 --> 01:42:47.172
<i>Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...</i>

01:42:47.274 --> 01:42:51.904
to join Jane Nichols and Kevin Doyle
in holy matrimony.

01:42:52.012 --> 01:42:56.711
Marriage is a cause for celebration.

01:42:56.817 --> 01:42:59.251
<i>It turns out I was right about one thing.</i>

01:43:00.855 --> 01:43:02.755
<i>I knew they'd all
be there for me someday.</i>

01:43:02.857 --> 01:43:05.052
<i>#Now I really see Love #</i>

01:43:07.661 --> 01:43:10.858
<i>#Has fallen on me #</i>

01:43:10.965 --> 01:43:14.765
<i>#Oh, what tender love
you bring #</i>

01:43:14.869 --> 01:43:18.464
<i>- #Love #
- #No, it's not a game #</i>

01:43:18.572 --> 01:43:21.040
<i>#Has fallen on me #</i>

01:43:21.141 --> 01:43:25.578
<i>#Oh, what tender love
you bring #</i>

01:43:25.679 --> 01:43:27.943
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:43:28.048 --> 01:43:29.948
You may kiss the bride.

01:43:31.552 --> 01:43:33.452
<i>#Hey #</i>

01:43:33.554 --> 01:43:36.785
<i># What tender love
you bring #</i>

01:43:36.891 --> 01:43:38.882
<i>#I fell in love with you #</i>

01:43:38.993 --> 01:43:41.723
<i>#Fell in love with you #</i>

01:43:41.829 --> 01:43:43.729
<i>#One day in September #</i>

01:43:43.831 --> 01:43:47.198
<i>#Love came tumbling down
on me #</i>

01:43:47.301 --> 01:43:49.201
<i>#One day in September #</i>

01:43:49.303 --> 01:43:52.534
<i>#Love came tumbling down
on me #</i>

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.608
<i>#One day in September #</i>

01:43:54.708 --> 01:43:57.939
<i>#Love came tumbling down
on me #</i>

01:43:58.045 --> 01:43:59.945
<i>#One day in September #</i>

01:44:00.047 --> 01:44:02.948
<i>#Love came tumbling down
on me #</i>

01:44:09.156 --> 01:44:12.091
<i>#Love is a burning inside #</i>

01:44:12.192 --> 01:44:14.820
<i>#I've never had
this feeling before, no #</i>

01:44:14.929 --> 01:44:18.797
<i>#All I know is that it won't
let me be myself #</i>

01:44:18.899 --> 01:44:20.799
<i>#Hey #</i>

01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:23.165
<i>#Is this really love #</i>

01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:26.603
<i>#Oh, maybe that's the reason
I feel so good #</i>

01:44:26.707 --> 01:44:28.607
<i># When you're around #</i>

01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:33.408
<i>#Feel so good
when you're around #</i>

01:44:34.982 --> 01:44:38.782
<i># Why can't I remember #</i>

01:44:40.287 --> 01:44:44.018
<i># The day I melted
before your charms #</i>

01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:49.494
<i>#Oh, was it way back
in September #</i>

01:44:50.898 --> 01:44:56.131
<i># When you held me
in your arms #</i>

01:44:56.236 --> 01:45:01.674
<i>#Now that I see
that you're the one for me #</i>

01:45:01.775 --> 01:45:04.608
<i>#It's no more a mystery #</i>

01:45:04.712 --> 01:45:07.374
<i>#Love has fallen down on me #</i>

01:45:07.481 --> 01:45:12.441

- #Mmm #</i>
