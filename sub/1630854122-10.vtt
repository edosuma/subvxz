Key up!

00:05.048 --> 00:06.484

00:06.571 --> 00:08.573
Key up!

00:08.660 --> 00:11.315
Make a left! Make a left!

00:11.402 --> 00:13.491
Switch!
- Ooh, come on now.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.015
You better switch up,
old man.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.407
I don't wanna embarrass you.
- Derrin! Derrin!

00:16.494 --> 00:17.278
I think it's time for me
to show you

00:17.365 --> 00:18.801
that European hard foul,
young blood.

00:18.888 --> 00:19.671
Man, you can't foul
what you can't touch.

00:19.758 --> 00:20.933
We'll see about that.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.852
Tonight gon' be my night!

00:26.939 --> 00:28.680
What you got?
Come on, man.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.378
Let's go.

00:37.689 --> 00:39.604
Let's get lit!

00:39.691 --> 00:42.607
Yeah, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

00:42.694 --> 00:44.087
Boys, listen, listen, listen.

00:44.174 --> 00:45.828
I have a better idea,
and you're gonna love it.

00:45.915 --> 00:47.090
Trust me.
- Look at this guy, man.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.700
What you doing?

00:48.787 --> 00:50.441
No! No!

00:50.528 --> 00:51.834
Stand up!
Come on!

00:51.921 --> 00:53.488
No. Come here, boy.

00:53.575 --> 00:54.880
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:57.753 --> 01:00.799
Hey, fun time, huh?

01:00.886 --> 01:02.758
All good in the hood?

01:02.845 --> 01:04.151
Yeah, all good.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.762
Good. Good.

01:06.849 --> 01:10.853
Now listen, brother, if you
want some other party favors,

01:10.940 --> 01:13.334
I can supply those too.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.205
- Don't make that offer again.
- Yeah, of course.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.946
Of course. I'm sorry.
Are you having a good time?

01:17.033 --> 01:18.208
Yes?

01:19.862 --> 01:22.430
OK, OK.
It's getting lit in here.

01:22.517 --> 01:23.735
Hey, look,
it's Derrin Vaughan!

01:23.822 --> 01:26.303
Excuse me.
What's up? I see you.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.045
Boys, let's celebrate.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.700
Down for a good time, man.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.355
Derrin! Derrin Vaughn
in the photo, please!

01:34.442 --> 01:35.573
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:35.660 --> 01:37.184
No photos. No photos.
- Thank you.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.446
I thought we weren't
gonna be hassled here.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.708
I take care of it.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.318
Have fun! Drink!

01:41.405 --> 01:42.363
Come on, man.
Let's party!

01:42.450 --> 01:46.367
- Oh, no. Not now.
- Get your hands off me!

01:46.454 --> 01:47.672
How could you
be out celebrating?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.805
Hey.
It was already paid for, baby.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.023
All right.
Come on, let's go.

01:51.111 --> 01:51.937
Let's go. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:52.024 --> 01:53.113
- Stop.
- Bye.

01:53.200 --> 01:54.940
- Don't touch me!
- Aw, man.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.381
We got to get out of here.
What's the next stop?

02:06.778 --> 02:09.129
- Hey, to the future, baby.
- Slow it down, man.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.565
Slow it down.
- To the future.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.262
all: The future.

02:12.349 --> 02:14.438
Mmm.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.312
Ooh.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.531
Oh, oh, oh, busted.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.359
OK.

02:22.446 --> 02:25.406
You can lock me up.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.582
Bro, are you OK?

02:27.669 --> 02:28.931
- He'll be fine.
- Whoo.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.847
- Yeah, let's go!
- Whoo!

02:31.934 --> 02:34.371
Bye! Bye! Have fun!

02:41.944 --> 02:43.380
What do you need?

02:43.467 --> 02:44.555
I'm just checking
on my friend.

02:44.642 --> 02:46.383
He's been back there
for a while.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.732
You can only go back there
if you're with a dancer

02:47.819 --> 02:49.604
and you pay.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.957
OK, something's up.
I need to talk to her.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.917
Hey, guys!

02:59.004 --> 03:00.702
- You don't know what happened?
- There!

03:00.789 --> 03:02.182
Hey!

03:02.269 --> 03:03.270
Hey!

03:03.357 --> 03:04.880
Get off me, man!

03:06.708 --> 03:07.796
Derrin!

03:10.886 --> 03:11.713
- Let me in!
- Let me go!

03:11.800 --> 03:13.802
All out!

03:13.889 --> 03:16.239
- Derrin! Derrin!
- Hey, let me go!

03:16.326 --> 03:18.110
Call an ambulance!

03:18.198 --> 03:20.374
Derrin! Derrin!
- Hey!

03:30.079 --> 03:31.994
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:32.081 --> 03:35.171
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.042
I know
when something's up with you.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.089
- Oh.
- You get quiet.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.786
And what am I normally?
A chatterbox?

03:41.873 --> 03:42.918
Something's up.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.441
Who's the new agent?

03:44.528 --> 03:46.443
- What are you talking about?
- Vo just texted

03:46.530 --> 03:48.663
there's a new agent upstairs
with Legat Dandridge.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.709
What?

03:51.796 --> 03:53.102
We all got
authorized overtime that day.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.715
Oh, morning.
Come on in.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.851
Zoey McKenna.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.810
She just wrapped a UC narcotics
assignment in Vienna.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.551
I wanted her to get
some casework experience

04:07.638 --> 04:09.640
with you guys, so she'll
be rotating in for a bit.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.772
It's nice to meet you.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.121
Can I talk to you for a second?

04:17.082 --> 04:19.781
Here to help,
whatever you need.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.043
Good to know.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.658
You have no business
bringing in a new agent

04:27.745 --> 04:29.878
without me knowing about it
and me signing off.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.445
What does it matter?
You're leaving anyway.

04:31.532 --> 04:33.708
Well, yeah, about that.
I don't work for you.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.666
While you and your team
are in Hungary,

04:35.753 --> 04:38.103
I'm the senior FBI
special agent in country

04:38.190 --> 04:39.322
and the diplomatically
recognized--

04:39.409 --> 04:41.498
I know the chain of command,

04:41.585 --> 04:44.501
but you have no power
to relocate me.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.764
Scott, this is coming
from the top.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.812
And it is in your best interest
career-wise to grasp that.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.770
Have you not even
told your team yet?

04:56.818 --> 04:58.733
Want me to?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.692
I will when this is official.

05:01.779 --> 05:05.174
It's official.
You have one more week.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.523
Keep this collegial

05:06.610 --> 05:08.090
and I will retain
the rest of the fly team,

05:08.177 --> 05:09.309
regardless of who replaces you.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.746
But if you dig your heels in,

05:11.833 --> 05:13.835
I will have them all
transferred back stateside

05:13.922 --> 05:15.967
and given assignments according
to the needs of the bureau,

05:16.054 --> 05:17.752
which as I'm sure
you are aware,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.710
is a euphemism for accounting.

05:22.626 --> 05:26.717
I need those signed and
returned as soon as possible.

05:26.804 --> 05:29.067
Come on.
We got a case.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.292
Derrin Vaughn, 22.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.947
American playing basketball for
a Lithuanian Euro-league team.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.427
One second.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.515
We're good.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.564
Lots of U.S.

05:47.651 --> 05:49.479
and international press
following this case.

05:49.566 --> 05:50.785
And the ambassador in Belgrade

05:50.872 --> 05:53.527
is expecting your assistance, soon.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.748
Continue.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.881
Other members of his team
were there,

05:59.968 --> 06:01.273
including his agent,
Josh Bing.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.579
There were in Belgrade
for a game

06:02.666 --> 06:04.146
and for Vaughn's
bachelor party.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.540
Now Vaughn went into cardiac
arrest at the strip club,

06:06.627 --> 06:07.845
but other members
of his crew claim

06:07.932 --> 06:09.281
he may have been drugged there.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.806
But he still had
his $10,000 watch on his wrist

06:11.893 --> 06:13.242
when he was transported
to the hospital.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.113
He's still there
in critical condition.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.289
The other American
on the team, Bryan Moncrief,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.204
apparently brandished a knife

06:19.291 --> 06:21.337
and threatened to kill
the manager and bouncer.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.905
He's been charged with assault
with a deadly weapon,

06:23.992 --> 06:25.646
drunk and disorderly,

06:25.733 --> 06:28.605
inciting violence,
and resisting arrest.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.564
He could be looking
at ten years.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.696
Vaughn's fiancÃ©e
is CiCi Pryor.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.394
Now she and Vaughn
had a confrontation

06:34.481 --> 06:35.569
before going to the strip club.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.962
Her real name is
Claudia Praegitzer.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.225
She's
a self-professed influencer.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.662
98,000 followers on Instagram.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.272
In the basketball league
they're in,

06:43.359 --> 06:45.666
each team could have
two American players max.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.233
Vaughn was a big deal
coming out of high school

06:48.320 --> 06:50.322
but flamed out in the G league.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.195
I remember him being a big get
for the Lithuanian team.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.936
Moncrief, I've never heard of.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.894
He played college ball
at Marist.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.940
Never made it to the NBA,
but he's played for nine teams

06:59.027 --> 07:00.985
in nine different countries
in the last ten years.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.771
Belgrade is known
as the Vegas of Eastern Europe.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.642
Not a big mystery
why Vaughn would want

07:05.729 --> 07:07.688
to have his bachelor party
there after the game.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.691
In terms of law enforcement
welcoming our involvement,

07:10.778 --> 07:13.998
there were allegations
of ties from organized crime

07:14.085 --> 07:15.086
to different levels
of government,

07:15.173 --> 07:16.566
including the police.

07:16.653 --> 07:20.788
But Serbia has been trying
to improve on that.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.920
Why are you here?

07:23.007 --> 07:24.400
Legat Dandridge felt it was--

07:24.487 --> 07:26.315
He left.
I'm asking you.

07:28.230 --> 07:30.580
I'm here to learn
and contribute.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.759
Cam, can you stay here
and liaise?

07:35.846 --> 07:37.065
There's no guarantee
what we're gonna be

07:37.152 --> 07:38.632
provided in Belgrade tech-wise.

07:38.719 --> 07:40.155
Yep.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.635
Thank you.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.680
Let's go.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.396
Lieutenant Mirko Obradovic.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.920
Megan Garretson, Europol.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.748
Special Agent Scott Forrester, FBI.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.271
You and your team
can work here.

08:09.358 --> 08:12.317
Computers have a few kilometers
on them, but we have internet.

08:12.404 --> 08:15.364
- Secured internet?
- I don't know.

08:15.451 --> 08:18.149
I'll have Zivko
from tech department come by.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.022
We also have a flat screen
somewhere we can bring in.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.719
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- OK.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.069
And Bryan Moncrief?

08:25.156 --> 08:27.115
Transferred
to detention facility.

08:27.202 --> 08:30.248
He was causing a bit
of a disturbance with,

08:30.335 --> 08:33.730
how shall I say,
the volume of his voice.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.427
So I had to have
a conversation with him.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.691
But we'll bring him back here.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.040
Derrin Vaughn,
he's still in the hospital.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.564
OK, we will keep you posted.
Please do the same.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.523
OK, look,
just because these two know

08:43.610 --> 08:45.307
how to score points
playing basketball

08:45.394 --> 08:47.265
does not mean they're going to
get any special consideration.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.354
There is no celebrity discount
in Serbia.

08:49.441 --> 08:50.355
Got it.

08:53.271 --> 08:55.926
Hey, how about I pair up
with McKenna?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.494
She wants to learn.
I'm a teacher at heart.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.017
Are you?

09:00.104 --> 09:01.366
I'll take that as a yes.

09:12.726 --> 09:16.686
Cardiologist and team doctor
have an update.

09:16.773 --> 09:19.950
He has been going into
dangerously rapid heart rate.

09:20.037 --> 09:22.257
We'll need to perform
an ablation procedure

09:22.344 --> 09:24.781
because the drugs we've
administered aren't working.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.217
And this could be
caused by a roofie

09:26.304 --> 09:28.393
slipped in his drink
at the strip club?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.700
Derrin has
a pre-existing heart condition,

09:30.787 --> 09:32.659
Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,

09:32.746 --> 09:36.140
which puts him at risk for
super ventricular tachycardia.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.142
The team knew this,
and he was cleared to play

09:38.229 --> 09:41.058
because there were
no active symptoms detected.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.844
Regarding what happened
at the club, I don't know.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.454
Ask his agent.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.152
But the roofie drug
would slow his heart down,

09:48.239 --> 09:50.720
not speed it up,
which is what happened.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.983
We are waiting
on the toxicology report

09:53.070 --> 09:55.246
to find out
what he had in his system.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.988
Please wait here. We'll let
you know about the results.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.602
Cops? Americans?

10:02.689 --> 10:04.429
FBI, Europol.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.910
Josh Bing, Derrin's agent.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.259
Must have been something
those vultures

10:08.346 --> 10:09.826
at the strip club
put in his drink.

10:09.913 --> 10:12.524
- You see anyone do that?
- No.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.004
Does anyone
see a roofie coming?

10:14.091 --> 10:16.006
Who knew
about Derrin's heart condition?

10:16.093 --> 10:18.008
Team doctor acted like
it was hush-hush.

10:18.095 --> 10:20.576
Not many people,
per my request.

10:20.663 --> 10:23.535
It got him dinged from some NBA
teams in pre-draft physicals.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.754
That's why he came to play
in Lithuania,

10:24.841 --> 10:26.103
which is why there is no way

10:26.190 --> 10:28.149
he would have
knowingly taken any drugs.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.499
Derrin's dream was
to make it to the NBA.

10:30.586 --> 10:31.500
All right?
He wouldn't jeopardize that.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.982
- You're CiCi.
- Yes.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.505
We understand
there was a confrontation

10:36.592 --> 10:38.159
between you and Derrin
at the nightclub.

10:38.246 --> 10:41.249
What was that about?
- It wasn't a confrontation.

10:41.336 --> 10:42.946
It was a conversation.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.818
- Let's call it that.
- He called off the wedding

10:44.905 --> 10:46.471
because of a lie
someone told him

10:46.558 --> 10:48.430
but still went on
to do his bachelor party.

10:48.517 --> 10:51.041
I went to the club
because he had it all wrong.

10:51.128 --> 10:54.741
I did not cheat on him.

10:54.828 --> 10:58.005
Screw you, Josh.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.790
If this could not get out,
the heart thing,

11:00.877 --> 11:01.835
that would be great.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.401
Great for who?

11:03.488 --> 11:04.533
For Derrin.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.143
For his...

11:06.230 --> 11:07.667
profile.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.023
I'm pretty sure

11:16.110 --> 11:18.112
PR's the least of his concerns
right now.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.333
Did you request
to rotate in with us,

11:22.420 --> 11:23.813
or did Dandridge assign you?

11:23.900 --> 11:24.945
Does it make a difference?

11:25.032 --> 11:26.555
To me, it does.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.079
A little bit of both.
I go back a ways with him.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.777
And is there anything
going on with him

11:30.864 --> 11:32.648
that should concern the team?
Because he's been acting

11:32.735 --> 11:35.042
like a kitten
with a ball of yarn lately.

11:35.129 --> 11:38.523
No, not that I know of.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.787
No.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.092
Before I came
on the team,

11:42.179 --> 11:43.920
I was
with a behavioral analysis unit

11:44.007 --> 11:46.923
in the high-value
interrogation group.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.969
We did a lot of work
determining whether people

11:49.056 --> 11:50.884
are authentically
telling the truth.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.146
You're not.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.330
Hello, ladies.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.680
Amateur Night is Thursdays.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.726
Eh, you won't
need those on stage.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.249
- What did you say?
- Sorry.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.468
What's funny in Belgrade
may be not funny in the U.S.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.122
OK, let's start over.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.820
Were you here last night?

12:13.907 --> 12:16.605
I was.
That big group came in.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.346
The Black one,
the younger one,

12:18.433 --> 12:20.827
he started freaking out because
of whatever drugs he took.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.525
Then the older Black one
started acting like a tough guy

12:23.612 --> 12:24.744
until he was proven wrong.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.223
Bryan Moncrief is his name.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.138
Was trying to help his friend.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.097
His friend who also has a name,
Derrin Vaughn,

12:30.184 --> 12:31.489
is still in the hospital.

12:31.576 --> 12:33.970
Look, these are
their problems, not mine.

12:34.057 --> 12:36.059
Moncrief pulled a knife
and threatened you?

12:36.146 --> 12:38.366
- Yes.
- Where is it?

12:38.453 --> 12:40.977
One of his friends probably
grabbed it off the floor.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.631
Oh.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.981
Security cameras in here?

12:45.068 --> 12:46.200
No.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.419
We respect
our customers' privacy.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.770
And the dancer who was with
Derrin Vaughn, where is she?

12:50.857 --> 12:51.988
On holiday.

12:52.075 --> 12:53.685
We're trying
to be friendly here,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.122
but if you'd rather
we be aggressive,

12:55.209 --> 12:56.297
that can happen too.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.564
Let's save some time.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.653
This place is protected.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.700
- By who?
- Ask around.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.968
Eh, let's find out
who we're dealing with first.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.678
Bryan.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.593
I'm Special Agent
Scott Forrester.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.029
I'm with the FBI.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.510
Can you get me out?

13:35.597 --> 13:37.817
If I can, yeah.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.083
What's the word on Derrin?

13:43.170 --> 13:44.519
He's in surgery.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.347
- For what?
- Something with his heart.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.567
Look, is there anything
that you can tell me

13:49.654 --> 13:52.396
about last night
that is not in the statement

13:52.483 --> 13:54.877
that you gave
Lieutenant Obradovic?

13:54.964 --> 13:57.445
- I did not have a knife on me.
- Mm-hmm.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.707
And I didn't
make any threats.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.013
OK.

14:00.100 --> 14:00.970
They still saying I did that?

14:01.057 --> 14:03.364
Yes, they are.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.323
So this is what a frame job
looks like, I guess.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.195
And why would someone
do that?

14:08.282 --> 14:10.327
Either the club was trying to
roll on us till we fought back,

14:10.414 --> 14:12.634
or someone has some money
on our games coming up

14:12.721 --> 14:15.071
and saw a good way to take out
our top two scorers.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.378
- Hmm.
- Do me a favor.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.206
You tell that lieutenant
he come back in here

14:19.293 --> 14:22.470
and put his hand on my neck,
I'ma fight back.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.603
Now that is the last thing
that you want to do right now.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.910
You're on that side
of the bars, bro.

14:27.997 --> 14:29.303
Keep your survival tips.

14:29.390 --> 14:31.609
Look, me and my whole team,

14:31.696 --> 14:34.917
we are here now,
and we are getting into this.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.745
If you are innocent--
- I am!

14:36.832 --> 14:39.008
How many more times
I gotta say?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.754
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>

14:45.841 --> 14:47.538
<i>I just wanted to call you
with an update.</i>

14:47.625 --> 14:49.192
<i>The doctor
just got back to us.</i>

14:49.279 --> 14:51.151
<i>And... there were complications.</i>

14:51.238 --> 14:53.240
Yeah, OK.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.594
What?

14:59.681 --> 15:02.727
Uh, there were...

15:05.687 --> 15:09.125
Complications.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.561
Derrin didn't make it.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.090
Oh.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.490
I'm sorry, Bryan.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.111
- I just heard.
- Is that strip club protected?

15:38.198 --> 15:40.156
- Probably.
- By who?

15:40.243 --> 15:41.897
By people I have to deal with

15:41.984 --> 15:44.030
long after you're are tucked
away in your beds in Budapest.

15:44.117 --> 15:45.683
- Wow.
- I'll remind you

15:45.770 --> 15:47.859
that Serbia's been negotiating
for years to get into the EU.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.166
So either you can perk up
and help our team

15:50.253 --> 15:52.952
investigate the suspicious
death of an American citizen,

15:53.039 --> 15:55.693
or I can make a call
to the director of Europol.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.956
Call whoever you want.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.696
As you wish.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.574
I got Vo.
I'll patch her in.

16:06.661 --> 16:08.489
Hey.

16:08.576 --> 16:09.707
<i>I found a number
of complaints</i>

16:09.794 --> 16:10.882
<i>against the promoter
who organized</i>

16:10.970 --> 16:12.536
the bachelor party last night.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.538
It's Milos Zoran.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.801
His company dropped
intoxicated customers off

16:16.888 --> 16:19.587
at the end of pub crawls,
and the customers were robbed.

16:19.674 --> 16:22.198
Here's a promo video
I found of his on the web.

16:22.285 --> 16:24.331
<i>Beautiful people.</i>

16:24.418 --> 16:26.855
<i>Beautiful scenery.
Beautiful times.</i>

16:26.942 --> 16:30.380
<i>Buses, limos,
party boats, dancers.</i>

16:30.467 --> 16:32.252
<i>We can provide it all.</i>

16:32.339 --> 16:33.731
<i>No scams.</i>

16:33.818 --> 16:35.864
<i>No extra charges.</i>

16:35.951 --> 16:37.735
<i>No surprises.</i>

16:37.822 --> 16:39.999
<i>Only fun times.</i>

16:40.086 --> 16:41.913
<i>Seems legit.</i>

16:42.001 --> 16:42.784
<i>Thank you, Cam.</i>

16:42.871 --> 16:44.264
Now you two check it out.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.716
Hello.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.807
I'm hearing things.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.635
Regarding?

17:07.722 --> 17:11.552
You, the fly team,
from my Europol contacts.

17:11.639 --> 17:16.687
Ah, well, I hope
it's not anything bad.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.124
Is it true?

17:24.913 --> 17:26.697
I don't know.

17:26.784 --> 17:30.223
But this job's not like
working on grandpa's farm.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.528
We're all
just a phone call away

17:31.615 --> 17:35.489
from moving on
to the next assignment.

17:35.576 --> 17:39.580
Well, that would be a shame
if it is.

17:39.667 --> 17:43.497
I asked for this transfer
and moved to Budapest

17:43.584 --> 17:45.673
so that I could
work with you again.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.198
And not because
you can hold your liquor

17:49.285 --> 17:53.289
but because...

17:53.376 --> 17:55.596
you're the best agent
and boss I've encountered.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.428
So...

18:12.526 --> 18:16.269
I apologize
for any miscommunication.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.836
My department and I will help
in any way that you need.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.229
Cheers.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.809
That was a typical night.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.245
Everyone had fun.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.769
Everyone got
their money's worth.

18:38.856 --> 18:42.686
What they did
at the strip club,

18:42.773 --> 18:45.820
I'm a party promoter,
not a babysitter.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.127
Derrin Vaughn is dead.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.998
Whoa, hey. What?

18:50.085 --> 18:52.870
So if someone was involved,
it's going to get bad for them.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.698
I was in the parking lot
in my party van.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.352
I saw nothing.
- Right.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.528
But you have had numerous
complaints against your company

18:58.615 --> 19:00.226
for dropping people off
at The Pink Diamond.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.576
- I've never had one complaint.
- Don't lie.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.361
Agent Kellett is trained
in lie detection.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.015
And I'll tell you what
I'm pretty sure she's thinking:

19:07.102 --> 19:09.104
"If he'll lie about something
that's in court records,

19:09.191 --> 19:10.932
he'll lie about anything."

19:15.545 --> 19:17.982
These two lady agents
are harassing me.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.202
Tell them
what they want to know.

19:20.289 --> 19:21.334
You know who this involves.

19:21.421 --> 19:22.726
Yes. Mm-hmm.

19:22.813 --> 19:23.901
I do.

19:23.988 --> 19:25.207
But I don't care.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.912
Yes, I do have a deal
in place

19:34.999 --> 19:37.524
with some local men
at that strip club.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.091
Mobsters,
I think you call them.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.572
I drop off drunk tourists,

19:42.659 --> 19:44.748
but though I have
no direct knowledge of this,

19:44.835 --> 19:46.315
those at the club,
they roll them for cash

19:46.402 --> 19:48.056
or credit card charges.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.666
Oftentimes, drugged.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.146
And you get a kickback.

19:51.233 --> 19:53.235
Sounds like
you know how it works.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.718
Police!

19:57.805 --> 19:59.894
Get down!

20:01.809 --> 20:04.551
- Police!
- Get down!

20:23.265 --> 20:25.920
Yes, sir.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.530
Amateur Night.

20:31.534 --> 20:32.622
Sure.
I'll check in later.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.581
OK.

20:34.668 --> 20:35.930
Bye.

20:38.237 --> 20:43.242
Certain tourists have
been taken advantage of, yes,

20:43.329 --> 20:45.418
but not those from last night.

20:45.505 --> 20:47.768
I told all the dancers personally

20:47.855 --> 20:49.900
Vaughn and his crew
were off-limits.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.903
- And why the compassion?
- They're high-profile.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.819
I don't need the hassle
if it goes bad.

20:55.906 --> 20:58.518
Now Australian backpackers,
American military,

20:58.605 --> 21:01.869
all day long,
but not celebrities.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.872
So maybe a bouncer or a
dancer didn't take your advice

21:04.959 --> 21:06.439
and went ahead with it anyway.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.179
Nah, wouldn't happen.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.877
What makes you so sure?

21:09.964 --> 21:11.444
They know who owns that club.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.796
All the same,
we'll need a list.

21:15.883 --> 21:17.580
All the dancers,
all the employees

21:17.667 --> 21:18.842
who were at the club
last night.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.061
Of course.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.280
Did Bryan Moncrief
have a knife?

21:26.110 --> 21:27.982
It was all so crazy
in the moment

21:28.069 --> 21:31.855
that it looked like he did,
but in thinking about it, no.

21:31.942 --> 21:33.944
All right.
Did he threaten to kill anyone?

21:34.031 --> 21:36.295
Eh, the music was so loud,
I thought--

21:36.382 --> 21:39.559
"No" is the short version.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.343
Correct, no.

21:47.001 --> 21:48.437
Free to go.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.917
There's an assistant coach
waiting in the lobby.

21:50.004 --> 21:53.050
He's gonna take you back
to your hotel room.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.313
You find out
who did this to Derrin?

21:54.400 --> 21:55.618
No, not yet.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.141
Did you know
about his heart condition?

21:57.228 --> 21:59.230
No. He have one?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.886
Yeah. Played a factor.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.192
Damn.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.063
But you two were close.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.283
We were getting there.

22:08.370 --> 22:12.200
I was hard on him at first.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.594
It just felt like he wasn't
living up to his potential.

22:14.681 --> 22:16.987
He had a real chance
to get to the NBA.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.338
A real chance.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.427
My window for that went away
a while ago.

22:21.514 --> 22:24.212
And to see him squander it away

22:24.299 --> 22:26.954
partying too much
and chasing women...

22:28.259 --> 22:32.568
Still, had I known last night
was gonna be his last,

22:32.655 --> 22:34.353
I would have chilled out,

22:34.440 --> 22:35.963
had a good time with him.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.677
Something's up with McKenna.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.723
A lot of private phone calls
off to the side.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.813
I'm being transferred.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.076
What?

23:02.163 --> 23:03.991
Yeah.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.558
Your choice?

23:05.645 --> 23:07.821
No, but I have
to roll with it.

23:07.908 --> 23:08.996
Why would Dandridge
want you out?

23:09.083 --> 23:10.650
You've been kicking ass
for him.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.042
I know, but apparently,
I have broken

23:12.129 --> 23:14.654
one of the top three rules
in the bureau:

23:14.741 --> 23:18.266
never make your boss
look irrelevant.

23:18.353 --> 23:20.399
So Dandridge planted McKenna
here for his eyes and ears.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.748
I don't know, maybe.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.489
But she's doing her job,
as far as I can see.

23:23.576 --> 23:27.101
Hey, look, just keep this
under wraps for now, all right?

23:27.188 --> 23:29.712
I'll let the team know
when we get back to Budapest.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.845
Toxicology report came back.

23:31.932 --> 23:33.716
No roofies found
in Vaughn's system.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.023
But they found
30 grams of Adderall,

23:36.110 --> 23:37.677
more than enough
to trigger his heart condition.

23:37.764 --> 23:40.157
He was murdered,
and whoever did it

23:40.244 --> 23:42.551
knew exactly
how to pull it off.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.564
Who in his world knew
about the heart condition?

23:55.651 --> 23:57.740
His ex-fiancÃ©e and his agent.

23:57.827 --> 24:01.135
And as far as we know, just the
head coach and GM of his team.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.050
Vaughn kept the heart thing
pretty buttoned up.

24:03.137 --> 24:04.355
Thought
it would hurt his chances

24:04.443 --> 24:06.009
of making it to the NBA
if it got out.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.055
A hate crime
from someone at the nightclub?

24:08.142 --> 24:09.491
I mean, he easily
could have been drugged there

24:09.578 --> 24:10.361
before
they hit the strip joint.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.754
Not out of the question.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.974
His agent said
Moncrief and Vaughn

24:14.061 --> 24:15.889
were definitely getting looks
when they rolled in there.

24:15.976 --> 24:18.239
Towards that,
I pulled up all social media

24:18.326 --> 24:19.893
from and regarding Vaughn
last night,

24:19.980 --> 24:22.722
including a couple of selfies
taken by fans

24:22.809 --> 24:25.289
at the nightclub
and the strip club.

24:25.376 --> 24:27.640
Also, it looks like
one of Vaughn's teammates

24:27.727 --> 24:31.034
posted live photos from both
clubs and geotagged Vaughn.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.775
So that could open up
the range of suspects

24:32.862 --> 24:34.342
who knew where Vaughn was

24:34.429 --> 24:36.823
and could easily have access
to him and his drink.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.302
I've got Vo again.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.262
Vaughn had a trust in place.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.090
His mom was
the sole beneficiary,

24:43.177 --> 24:45.962
<i>including a life insurance
policy worth about five mil.</i>

24:46.049 --> 24:48.008
<i>He amended the trust
two months ago</i>

24:48.095 --> 24:50.401
to include his fiancÃ©e, CiCi.

24:50.489 --> 24:53.709
She's getting 50%,
for whatever that's worth.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.015
<i>Thanks, Vo.
We're on it.</i>

24:55.102 --> 24:58.758
Scott, while I have you,
the assistant director

24:58.845 --> 25:00.281
at the admin division
in Alabama

25:00.368 --> 25:02.457
has called for you twice.

25:02.544 --> 25:03.893
<i>Not sure what it's about.</i>

25:03.980 --> 25:05.852
<i>Do you want me
to give him your cell?</i>

25:05.939 --> 25:07.767
Text me his number.
I'll give him a call later.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.420
<i>Will do.</i>

25:19.866 --> 25:21.171
Oh, no.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.046
He always wanted
to come here.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.178
To Belgrade?

25:28.265 --> 25:29.745
Eastern Europe.

25:29.832 --> 25:32.052
Did he have a hard time
out here?

25:32.139 --> 25:34.620
Actually, he was loving it.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.189
He was finally
playing ball again

25:39.276 --> 25:41.148
and dominating.

25:41.235 --> 25:45.805
CiCi, we need to bring up
the trust that Derrin had.

25:45.892 --> 25:47.023
OK.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.285
You were co-beneficiary.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.070
That's right.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.986
And there was
an insurance policy in place.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.988
Right.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.773
How long ago
were you made co-beneficiary?

25:57.860 --> 25:59.427
I think you probably know,
since it looks like

25:59.514 --> 26:00.994
you know everything else
about it.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.865
Whose idea was it
to put you on the trust?

26:02.952 --> 26:05.520
Derrin's, since we were
going to get married.

26:05.607 --> 26:06.956
We're not looking at you
as a suspect.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.654
We're trying to eliminate you
as a suspect.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.307
Who do you think
you're talking to?

26:10.394 --> 26:13.441
Don't try and play me,
all right?

26:13.528 --> 26:14.877
Just ask you damn questions,

26:14.964 --> 26:16.096
'cause
that's what you here for.

26:16.183 --> 26:18.577
Let me point out
that since Derrin missed out

26:18.664 --> 26:20.970
on an NBA contract,
that insurance policy

26:21.057 --> 26:23.233
made him worth more dead
than alive.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.887
You really suck.

26:24.974 --> 26:27.063
He broke it off with you.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.892
You made threats,
confronted him at the club.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.677
You were close enough
to drop something in his drink.

26:31.764 --> 26:35.855
I lose Derrin,
and now this?

26:35.942 --> 26:38.205
- We have to ask the question.
- Then ask it!

26:38.292 --> 26:40.250
Did you put anything
in Derrin's drink last night,

26:40.337 --> 26:42.557
or have someone do it for you?

26:42.644 --> 26:43.819
No.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.397
You like her for it?

26:56.484 --> 26:57.964
Not really.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.227
But if she's still
a suspect, I guess.

27:00.314 --> 27:04.144
Um, my recent UC assignment
involved synthetic drugs.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.628
So I took a look at the
toxicology report on Vaughn.

27:09.715 --> 27:11.412
The local medical examiner
was close,

27:11.499 --> 27:13.544
but it wasn't Adderall
in Vaughn's system.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.937
Adderall is equal parts

27:15.024 --> 27:17.244
racemic amphetamine
and dextroamphetamine.

27:17.331 --> 27:18.288
Vaughn only had dextroamphetamine

27:18.375 --> 27:19.855
in his system.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.727
It has similar effects
to Adderall,

27:21.814 --> 27:23.990
only it hits harder and has
a more aggressive comedown.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.079
Prescriptions
for dextroamphetamine

27:26.166 --> 27:27.950
are available
in a handful of countries,

27:28.037 --> 27:30.213
and only one in Europe:
Switzerland.

27:32.781 --> 27:36.176
The team trainer,
Noah Muller...

27:38.482 --> 27:39.788
He's from Switzerland.

27:41.964 --> 27:42.922
Nice work.

27:44.619 --> 27:45.838
Let's hit it.

27:49.929 --> 27:52.322
It's your lead.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.846
Let's go.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.205
Make the intros.
Kick it off.

28:05.292 --> 28:08.077
I'll jump in if I need to.

28:08.164 --> 28:10.601
Very hard to read.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.864
Good.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.915
- Noah Muller?
- Yes.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.787
Agents McKenna
and Forrester, FBI.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.008
You're here
about Derrin Vaughn.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.837
We are.
Do you know anything about it?

28:28.924 --> 28:31.535
In terms of
who might have done this, no.

28:31.622 --> 28:33.233
Did you know
about his heart condition?

28:33.320 --> 28:36.889
No, none of us outside the
gym and the team doctor did.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.412
Everyone's been
talking about it now though.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.761
It's quite a shock.
- Yeah.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.284
Well, he basically
died from an overdose

28:41.371 --> 28:42.198
of dextroamphetamine.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.983
OK.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.027
You're from the only country
in Europe

28:45.114 --> 28:46.507
where you can
get a prescription for it.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.814
OK, I'm not sure
what this has to do with me.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.512
Ah, the service
in here is terrible.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.123
Doctor's offices, huh?

28:54.210 --> 28:55.951
That is a beautiful family.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.170
Thank you.

28:57.257 --> 29:00.129
Do you mind
if I use your telephone?

29:00.216 --> 29:02.088
Zoey, can you call Vo

29:02.175 --> 29:04.394
and get all the records
of Mr. Muller's phone calls,

29:04.481 --> 29:07.615
computer records, and purchases
on the team credit card?

29:07.702 --> 29:10.009
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

29:14.404 --> 29:17.581
Mm-hmm.
Thought so.

29:17.668 --> 29:20.976
You have one chance
to tell me the truth.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.587
A week ago, I was asked
by one of the players

29:23.674 --> 29:25.589
to get 30 milligrams
of dextroamphetamine.

29:25.676 --> 29:26.765
Which player?

29:30.943 --> 29:32.771
Bryan Moncrief.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.918
Not him. Uh-uh.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.181
Just hang back,
all right?

29:52.268 --> 29:55.576
What's the latest?
Fellas, FBI.

29:55.663 --> 29:56.925
Still doing
some follow-up questioning.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.318
It's the stripper

29:58.405 --> 29:59.885
Derrin went back
to the champagne room with.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.451
You guys
haven't proven that yet?

30:01.538 --> 30:02.539
No, we actually
need to follow up

30:02.626 --> 30:03.584
on some things with you.

30:03.671 --> 30:04.977
OK.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.282
Not here.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.023
- Where then?
- Police station.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.373
Nah, nah, nah, we could
talk about anything right here.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.680
Bryan, you can either
be taken out the front

30:12.767 --> 30:15.074
past all the cameras,
or we can go out the back door,

30:15.161 --> 30:17.076
nice and friendly,

30:17.163 --> 30:19.382
but we are going.

30:23.865 --> 30:27.303
Why would I slip drugs
in his drink?

30:27.390 --> 30:31.699
Money, revenge, disrespect.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.310
A girl.

30:34.397 --> 30:36.269
We noticed a lot of calls

30:36.356 --> 30:39.489
between you and CiCi
on your cell.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.361
I was giving her advice.

30:41.448 --> 30:44.364
Was trying to help
keep their relationship afloat.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.061
I could see
that they loved each other.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.672
Or you two hatched a plan
to be together at any cost.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.152
No. No way.

30:50.239 --> 30:53.939
2:00 a.m. for 45 minutes.

30:54.026 --> 30:56.506
10:30 a.m. for a half an hour.

30:56.593 --> 30:58.769
I don't like
to see women cry.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.684
What can I tell you?

31:00.771 --> 31:02.164
You can tell us why
you got the dextroamphetamine.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.210
- Who said I did?
- A very credible source.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.212
Well, they're setting me up,
just like those clowns

31:06.299 --> 31:08.257
at the strip club with
their knives and death threats.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.693
Why set you up?

31:09.780 --> 31:11.870
Take a guess.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.176
Bryan, we need
to start talking

31:14.263 --> 31:15.699
about what really happened.

31:15.786 --> 31:16.700
I told you.

31:20.574 --> 31:23.272
We found this in his gym bag.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.412
- This is a setup!
- Sit down!

31:32.499 --> 31:33.630
- Hey, back up.
- I swear to God!

31:33.717 --> 31:35.110
I swear on my life!
- I got this.

31:35.197 --> 31:36.590
All right?
That ain't mine.

31:36.677 --> 31:38.070
In a million years,
I would never do something

31:38.157 --> 31:39.506
like that to Derrin!

31:50.560 --> 31:53.172
Whoever digs another man's
pit falls into it himself.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.478
He needs to be treated fairly
while he is in your custody.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.002
If I find out that he isn't,

31:57.089 --> 31:58.568
you're gonna have a problem
on your hands.

31:58.655 --> 32:00.657
The international kind.
- Our job is done.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.572
I hand this over
to the prosecutor's office now.

32:02.659 --> 32:04.009
Well, we need more proof.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.488
Can you get that bottle checked
for prints?

32:05.575 --> 32:07.751
I apologize
for not making myself clear.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.798
When I say our job is done,
that means you as well.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.539
Whatever you want to do
back in Budapest,

32:12.626 --> 32:14.584
that's your business,
but you are done here.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.891
And you can call
whoever you like.

32:16.978 --> 32:18.762
No way that bottle's his.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.764
You say you found it
in his gym bag?

32:20.851 --> 32:22.070
No shot.

32:22.157 --> 32:24.246
Moncrief is
from East St. Louis.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.031
If he really
did take out Vaughn,

32:26.118 --> 32:27.597
there's no way he would have
kept the murder weapon around

32:27.684 --> 32:28.685
as a keepsake.

32:28.772 --> 32:30.078
That bottle was planted.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.428
- Careful.
- I'm not saying by you.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.169
I'm just saying by somebody.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.651
Wrap it up here.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.131
Thank you.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.572
OK.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.227
If not Moncrief, then who?

32:48.314 --> 32:49.793
We don't have a lot of time.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.317
Here's a theory.

32:51.404 --> 32:55.190
Who stood to benefit
with Vaughn out of the way?

32:55.277 --> 32:58.280
This guy.
Bogdon Vidmar. Slovenian.

32:58.367 --> 32:59.934
Played the same position
as Vaughn.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.981
Before the team signed Vaughn,
Bogdon was the starter.

33:03.068 --> 33:04.417
Now he's on the bench.

33:04.504 --> 33:07.637
And he had access
to Vaughn's drink that night.

33:07.724 --> 33:10.336
He'd kill his teammate
for more playing time?

33:10.423 --> 33:11.772
Bogdon
and the team trainer, Muller,

33:11.859 --> 33:13.948
played on the same Greek team
two years ago.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.298
Muller went
to Bogdon's wedding.

33:16.385 --> 33:19.432
OK, we need to get Bogdon
and Muller together quickly

33:19.519 --> 33:20.650
without them knowing
we orchestrated it.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.217
See which one spills it first.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.114
So basically,
the investigation is complete,

33:49.201 --> 33:50.854
but we just need
formal statements

33:50.941 --> 33:52.900
to, you know,
put a bow on the whole thing.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.336
Did you know him,
Derrin Vaughn?

33:54.423 --> 33:55.816
Well, yes, I did.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.470
Awful. Just awful.

33:57.557 --> 33:59.167
So I write a statement, or--

34:00.951 --> 34:02.736
Oh, blast it.

34:02.823 --> 34:04.564
Did I forget to bring the form?
- No, I have them.

34:04.651 --> 34:06.305
Ah, thanks, Jamie.

34:06.392 --> 34:08.568
You basically just sign off
on our statement of facts.

34:08.655 --> 34:10.439
We're having each employee
report to the snack room

34:10.526 --> 34:13.138
one at a time,
and then we'll come get you.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.357
- The team bus leaves in--
- Five minutes tops.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.185
Your GM and coach are aware.

34:30.764 --> 34:31.808
Luka.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.874
<i>Here for the statement?</i>

34:53.961 --> 34:55.484
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:55.571 --> 34:56.920
Come on. Come on.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.922
Come on.

35:06.582 --> 35:09.411
- We need to make sure--
- Not here.

35:13.415 --> 35:14.938
No, no.

35:15.025 --> 35:17.637
No, no, no, no.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.334
We lost the audio.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.519
I have the IMEI code
on Muller's phone,

35:30.606 --> 35:32.173
since it was team-issued.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.958
What's the Serbian law
as it relates

35:35.045 --> 35:37.135
to the interception of voice
and telephone communication?

35:37.222 --> 35:38.223
Accommodating.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.795
We need to make sure
our story is the same.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.667
It is.
And clearly it worked.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.538
Just keep blaming Moncrief, OK?

35:49.625 --> 35:52.411
The statements
they want us to give...

35:52.498 --> 35:54.587
<i>You got the prescription
for Moncrief.</i>

35:54.674 --> 35:56.545
<i>He wanted to take out Vaughn.
That's it.</i>

35:56.632 --> 35:57.807
<i>That's all you keep saying,
OK?</i>

35:57.894 --> 36:00.419
<i>Plus, they're not gonna
believe him over you.</i>

36:00.506 --> 36:02.072
<i>- The bottle--
- I put it in his bag.</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:03.552
Don't worry about the bottle.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.860
- And what if--
- We are done talking.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.557
Chill out, man.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.256
Everything's gonna be fine.
Take a deep breath.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.694
Hey.
Why is your phone recording?

36:17.827 --> 36:18.828
What? Oh!

36:23.964 --> 36:26.662
- You're both under arrest.
- Hands behind your back.

36:45.507 --> 36:49.032
If you don't want
to help yourself, help them.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.558
Unless you're OK
with seeing them

36:52.645 --> 36:55.387
behind a set of bars
for the next 20 years.

36:55.474 --> 36:58.390
Because if Bogdon
confesses first,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.261
it's over for you.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.447
Look at them.

37:12.534 --> 37:15.668
Look at your kids.

37:15.755 --> 37:19.672
What do you think they would
tell you to do right now?

37:19.759 --> 37:21.239
OK.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.242
<i>What happened?</i>

37:27.984 --> 37:30.335
<i>Bogdon was worried about
his roster spot on the team.</i>

37:33.163 --> 37:35.209
All players are
given a drug test

37:35.296 --> 37:40.562
once a month since the next
test was scheduled for today.

37:40.649 --> 37:44.044
So he wanted something he could
give Vaughn so Vaughn would

37:44.131 --> 37:48.004
fail the test and get cut.

37:48.091 --> 37:54.446
But he didn't, we didn't know
about his heart condition.

37:54.533 --> 37:55.664
No way he would have
done so had he known.

37:55.751 --> 38:01.017
No way I would have
given him the drugs.

38:01.104 --> 38:07.850
, doesn't it?

38:07.937 --> 38:14.770
Absolutely.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.661
Vaughn's stuff?

38:35.748 --> 38:42.363
Yeah.

38:45.366 --> 38:46.193
- Hey, great work.
- Hey, you too.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.108
Thanks for helping.

38:48.195 --> 38:50.415
I really appreciate
you including me.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.679
I thought for sure you were
gonna freeze me out.

38:53.766 --> 39:00.599
It's not my style.

39:11.740 --> 39:17.529
Got this for him
when he signed.

39:17.616 --> 39:21.837
Thank you for bringing
it back to me.

39:21.924 --> 39:26.146
I noticed B-H-I-T-W
engraved on the back.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.409
What does that mean?

39:28.496 --> 39:32.761
He'd get down sometimes
about his heart condition.

39:32.848 --> 39:38.158
A lot of why me, you know.

39:38.245 --> 39:40.987
I told him it's because he had
the biggest heart in the world

39:41.074 --> 39:46.732
and that one of the seams was
just stretching a little bit.

39:46.819 --> 39:53.478
B-H-I-T-W. The Biggest
Heart in the World.

40:00.267 --> 40:05.707
I can't believe he's gone.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.720
All over a roster spot.

40:18.807 --> 40:20.679
Yep.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.898
Crazy.

40:22.985 --> 40:24.334
They're claiming they
didn't know anything

40:24.422 --> 40:27.381
about the heart condition.

40:27.468 --> 40:33.779
I tend to believe them, but
that's cold comfort, I'm sure.

40:33.866 --> 40:34.736
You know what's crazy?

40:34.823 --> 40:37.217
Hmm?

40:37.304 --> 40:40.176
I do remember
telling him what

40:40.263 --> 40:44.746
I've been dealing with these
nine years I've been out here.

40:44.833 --> 40:47.445
There's always gonna be
someone gunning for your spot.

40:47.532 --> 40:51.144
And you got to have the
same attitude every time.

40:51.231 --> 40:55.278
Which is?

40:55.365 --> 41:02.460
Come and take it.

41:15.385 --> 41:22.044
Scott, come on in.

41:23.219 --> 41:29.661
Thank you.

41:33.621 --> 41:34.840
It's not signed.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.016
Because I'm not leaving.

41:37.103 --> 41:39.453
This is gonna get
acrimonious very quickly.

41:39.540 --> 41:41.063
Let it.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.413
I'm not going without a fight.
