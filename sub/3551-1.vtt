WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.373
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.373 --> 00:05.776
TEN YEARS AGO, CARLOS' MOTHER
DIED AFTER BEING HIT BY A CAR

00:05.776 --> 00:07.378
THAT ANDREW WAS DRIVING.

00:07.378 --> 00:08.779
ORSON PACKED HIS BAGS...

00:08.779 --> 00:11.042
YOU ARE NOT THE WOMAN
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.644
HE'S MY SON.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

00:13.644 --> 00:16.146
AND I NO LONGER CHOOSE
TO BE YOUR HUSBAND.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.189
AND BREE DECIDED TO COME CLEAN.

00:18.189 --> 00:19.650
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU--

00:19.650 --> 00:22.193
IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
COULD END OUR FRIENDSHIP.

00:22.193 --> 00:25.156
A DYING NURSE
MADE A CONFESSION...

00:25.156 --> 00:28.159
THE PEOPLE WHO RUN THIS HOSPITAL
NEED TO KNOW WHAT I DID.

00:28.159 --> 00:31.162
HOW DO YOU TELL PARENTS
THE CHILD THEY'VE BEEN RAISING

00:31.162 --> 00:32.803
ISN'T REALLY THEIRS?

00:32.803 --> 00:36.337
FINANCIAL WORRIES DROVE SUSAN
TO A BIG DECISION...

00:36.337 --> 00:39.140
YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR HOUSE.
 WE'RE NOT SELLING.
WE'RE RENTING.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.672
WHICH LED TO THE RETURN
OF A LONG-LOST NEIGHBOR.

00:41.672 --> 00:43.774
THE TRUTH IS,
I USED TO LIVE HERE.

00:43.774 --> 00:47.178
OH, THEN I GUESS EVERYONE WILL
BE SURPRISED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:47.178 --> 00:48.679
THEY ABSOLUTELY WILL.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.357
(Mary Alice) THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I

00:56.357 --> 00:58.829
WERE VERY HAPPY.

00:58.829 --> 01:02.363
I REMEMBER
WARM SUMMER AFTERNOONS

01:02.363 --> 01:04.694
AND BACKYARD BARBECUES

01:04.694 --> 01:07.498
AND LAUGHTER WITH FRIENDS.

01:07.498 --> 01:12.103
OUR LIFE WAS LIKE SOME KIND
OF SUBURBAN DREAM.

01:12.103 --> 01:16.547
BUT THE DAY COMES
WHEN WE ALL MUST WAKE UP.

01:20.351 --> 01:27.158
FOR ME, THAT DAY CAME
WHEN A LETTER ARRIVED.

01:27.158 --> 01:28.859
AS THREATS GO,

01:28.859 --> 01:32.823
IT WAS CONCISE
AND TO THE POINT.

01:32.823 --> 01:39.200
I DID WHAT I HAD TO
TO PROTECT MY FAMILY.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.635
MY HUSBAND FOUND OUT
WHO WROTE THE LETTER.

01:44.635 --> 01:50.110
HE LET HER KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS UPSET HIM.

01:50.110 --> 01:55.616
HER SISTER FIGURED OUT
WHAT MY HUSBAND HAD DONE.

01:55.616 --> 02:01.552
SO SHE DECIDED TO FRAME HIM
FOR MURDER...

02:01.552 --> 02:06.657
HER MURDER,
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

02:06.657 --> 02:10.731
AND THAT'S WHEN THE DREAM
THAT WAS PAUL YOUNG'S LIFE

02:10.731 --> 02:13.534
BECAME A NIGHTMARE.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.539
YEARS LATER,

02:18.539 --> 02:20.841
A WOMAN WAS PULLED OVER
FOR SPEEDING.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.175
(siren wailing)

02:24.175 --> 02:27.918
THIS WOMAN
HAD NO IDENTIFICATION,

02:27.918 --> 02:29.620
SO SHE WAS ARRESTED.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.352
(clicks)

02:31.352 --> 02:35.186
AND THAT IS HOW PEOPLE LEARNED
THAT FELICIA TILLMAN

02:35.186 --> 02:37.828
WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.234
I SEE YOU GOT THE SUIT
I SENT OVER. YOU LIKE IT?

02:43.234 --> 02:45.496
I LIKE ANYTHING
THAT'S NOT ORANGE.

02:45.496 --> 02:48.299
WELL, GET READY TO DO
ALL SORTS OF SHOPPING.

02:48.299 --> 02:50.301
YOUR SETTLEMENT CHECK
CAME IN.

02:50.301 --> 02:52.503
SO WHERE YOU GOING FIRST?

02:52.503 --> 02:55.175
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IN PRISON,
I BET YOU'RE READY TO PARTY.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.548
ALL I WANT IS TO GO HOME.

02:57.548 --> 02:59.850
WHAT,
TO YOUR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD?

02:59.850 --> 03:01.782
YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.685
WELL, NONE OF YOUR NEIGHBORS
SUPPORTED YOU DURING THE TRIAL.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.957
THEY DIDN'T VISIT
WHILE YOU WERE HERE.

03:06.957 --> 03:10.221
NO ONE WOULD BLAME YOU
IF YOU HATED THEM A LITTLE.

03:10.221 --> 03:13.394
OH, I DON'T HATE THEM...

03:13.394 --> 03:14.865
A LITTLE.

03:14.865 --> 03:16.867
(birds chirping)

03:16.867 --> 03:21.232
AND SO MY HUSBAND RETURNED
TO WISTERIA LANE.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.978
THE NEIGHBORS WERE SURPRISED
TO SEE HIM.

03:27.978 --> 03:32.613
THEY HADN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT PAUL YOUNG IN YEARS.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.746
BUT HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THEM.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.820
AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE SURE

03:39.820 --> 03:43.824
THEY'D NEVER FORGET HIM...
AGAIN.

03:55.005 --> 03:59.239
THE PHONE CALL THAT COMES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...

03:59.239 --> 04:03.474
THE LETTER THAT ARRIVES
BY SPECIAL COURIER...

04:03.474 --> 04:07.848
THE E-MAIL MARKED "URGENT!"...

04:07.848 --> 04:11.582
YES,
THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF WAYS

04:11.582 --> 04:14.425
BAD NEWS CAN BE DELIVERED.

04:14.425 --> 04:17.928
BUT SOME NEWS IS SO BAD...

04:17.928 --> 04:20.630
IT MUST BE DELIVERED IN PERSON.

04:20.630 --> 04:22.633
WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL THEM?

04:22.633 --> 04:25.796
YOU SAID THIS COUPLE
LIVES IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:25.796 --> 04:27.298
TRUSTEES OF THE HOSPITAL

04:27.298 --> 04:29.540
FEEL THAT MAKES YOU
UNIQUELY QUALIFIED.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.542
AND JUST WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?

04:31.542 --> 04:33.003
"GREAT BLOCK PARTY.

04:33.003 --> 04:35.005
"BY THE WAY,
ONE OF OUR NURSES

04:35.005 --> 04:37.678
MAY HAVE SWITCHED YOUR BABY
AT BIRTH. TRY THE DIP."

04:37.678 --> 04:38.979
EVERY MINUTE WE WAIT,

04:38.979 --> 04:40.981
THIS HOSPITAL TAKES ON
MORE LIABILITY.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.414
NOW GET ON OVER TO...
WISTERIA LANE

04:43.414 --> 04:45.686
AND TELL THOSE PEOPLE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.888
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GONNA DO THIS.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.621
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO DELIVER NEWS LIKE THIS--

04:50.621 --> 04:53.324
REMAIN AS CALM AS POSSIBLE.

04:54.765 --> 04:57.868
BREE! GET OUT HERE!

04:57.868 --> 05:00.371
DAMN IT!
WHY IS NOBODY HOME?

05:00.371 --> 05:03.634
LORNA, GWEN...
OH, THANK GOD.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.906
WELL, HI, KAREN.
WHAT'S WRONG?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.038
PAUL YOUNG--HE'S BACK.

05:08.038 --> 05:10.040
(gasps) WHAT?

05:10.040 --> 05:12.312
YOU HEARD ME.
NOW DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.315
WE GOTTA WARN PEOPLE.
COME ON.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.316
(sighs)

05:16.316 --> 05:18.619
BREE, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.920
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.892
I HAVE SOMETHING HORRIBLE
TO TELL YOU,

05:21.892 --> 05:23.924
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SAY IT.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.926
WELL, YOU BETTER THINK
OF SOMETHIN'.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.459
YOU'RE STARTING
TO FREAK ME OUT.

05:28.459 --> 05:30.461
REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
WHEN CARLOS' MOTHER

05:30.461 --> 05:33.904
WAS RUN OVER BY A CAR?

05:33.904 --> 05:36.006
WELL, I KNOW WHO DID IT.

05:36.006 --> 05:38.609
YOU WHAT?

05:38.609 --> 05:40.371
(whispers) IT WAS ANDREW.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.476
OH, GOD!

05:45.476 --> 05:48.779
HE WAS ONLY 16. I WAS AFRAID
HE WAS GONNA GO TO JAIL...

05:48.779 --> 05:51.782
OHH! (exhales deeply)
 SO REX AND I DECIDED
TO COVER IT UP.

05:51.782 --> 05:56.387
OH, THIS IS--THIS IS BAD.
THIS IS REALLY BAD.

05:56.387 --> 05:59.059
I NEED TO GO THROW UP
A LITTLE.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.493
OH, I AM SO SORRY. AND I REALIZE
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU SOONER.

06:02.493 --> 06:05.696
NO! NO, NO, NO, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD ME AT ALL!

06:05.696 --> 06:08.999
WHAT?
 NOW I HAVE TO TELL CARLOS,
AND HE'S GOING TO KILL ANDREW,

06:08.999 --> 06:11.672
AND THEN HE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO GO TO PRISON,

06:11.672 --> 06:14.104
SO THANK YOU FOR SENDING
MY HUSBAND TO PRISON, BREE.

06:14.104 --> 06:17.107
NICE WORK!
 I JUST COULDN'T LIVE
WITH THE SECRET ANY LONGER,

06:17.107 --> 06:19.009
AND WHEN ORSON FOUND OUT,

06:19.009 --> 06:22.012
HE TOLD ME
I WAS A HORRIBLE PERSON.
 THAT'S WHY YOU TOLD ME?

06:22.012 --> 06:24.014
OH, PLEASE,
WE'RE ALL HORRIBLE PEOPLE!

06:24.014 --> 06:25.716
YOU SEE THIS?
IT'S YOURS.

06:25.716 --> 06:27.918
THEY DELIVERED IT HERE.
I KEPT IT. HORRIBLE!

06:27.918 --> 06:30.090
(magazine slams)
 JUST SO YOU KNOW,
ORSON WAS SO DISGUSTED,

06:30.090 --> 06:31.792
HE'S DIVORCING ME.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.794
NORMALLY, I'D GIVE YOU A HUG,

06:33.794 --> 06:36.797
BUT RIGHT NOW
I SORTA DON'T GIVE A CRAP!
 AGAIN, VERY SORRY.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.970
GOD!
HOW AM I GONNA TELL CARLOS?

06:39.970 --> 06:42.102
HE IS GONNA BE SO ANGRY!

06:42.102 --> 06:46.607
AND HE'LL PROBABLY FIND A WAY
TO BLAME ME! (cries)

06:48.709 --> 06:51.041
(knock on door)

06:51.041 --> 06:53.744
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHO'S BACK!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.018
MOM, WE DON'T HAVE
ANY CLEAN PLATES.

06:58.018 --> 07:00.020
DIDN'T YOU RUN THE DISHWASHER?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.993
WE'RE ALSO OUT OF MILK.
YOU GOTTA GO TO THE STORE.

07:02.993 --> 07:05.496
AND THE DRY CLEANERS
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

07:05.496 --> 07:08.098
OKAY, EVERYBODY.
LOOK AT YOUR HANDS.

07:08.098 --> 07:10.531
COME ON. MM-HMM.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.033
ANYONE NOT HOLDING A BABY,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.165
YOU CAN WASH AND SHOP
AND CLEAN FOR YOURSELVES.

07:15.165 --> 07:17.167
MY DAYS OF BEING THE PERFECT MOM
ARE OVER.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.570
(under breath) WHEN WERE
THOSE DAYS, EXACTLY?

07:19.570 --> 07:22.072
IT'S MY UTERUS THAT'S WORN OUT,
NOT MY HEARING.

07:22.072 --> 07:24.074
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP
WITH ANYTHING?

07:24.074 --> 07:27.748
'CAUSE THIS PLACE IS REALLY
STARTING TO GO TO HELL.
 BABY NUMBER FIVE.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.050
AN ENTIRE BASKETBALL TEAM
HAS COME OUT OF ME,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.753
SO I'M OFFICIALLY TOO EXHAUSTED
TO CARE.

07:32.753 --> 07:35.025
(telephone rings)

07:35.025 --> 07:38.989
YOU KNOW, THE GOOD MOMS ENJOY
DOING STUFF FOR THEIR FAMILIES.

07:38.989 --> 07:40.160
HELLO?
 (crying)

07:40.160 --> 07:42.863
THAT'S YOUR BROTHER PRESTON.
HE'S ABOUT TO BE BEATEN.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.865
(baby talk) YES, HE IS.
YES, HE IS.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.166
MOM, IT'S RENEE PERRY.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.770
(gasps) HEY, RENEE!

07:49.770 --> 07:52.703
WHO'S RENEE PERRY?
 OH, SHE'S YOUR MOM'S FRIEND
FROM COLLEGE.

07:52.703 --> 07:55.906
SHE'S MARRIED TO DOUG PERRY,
WHO PLAYS FOR THE YANKEES.

07:55.906 --> 07:58.178
AND SHE'S REALLY RICH.
 HOW RICH?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.851
EVERY FEW YEARS,
RENEE FLIES MOM TO NEW YORK

08:00.851 --> 08:05.015
FOR A BIG, FANCY WEEKEND.
 AND MOM ALWAYS COMES BACK
IN A GREAT MOOD.

08:05.015 --> 08:07.157
SO THIS MIGHT BE
PERFECT TIMING.

08:07.157 --> 08:09.660
DAMN IT TO HELL.
SHE'S COMING HERE.

08:09.660 --> 08:10.661
WH-WHEN?

08:10.661 --> 08:11.722
TOMORROW.

08:11.722 --> 08:12.723
WHY?

08:12.723 --> 08:14.024
I DON'T KNOW,

08:14.024 --> 08:16.026
BUT THAT IS SOMETHING
WE CAN TALK ABOUT

08:16.026 --> 08:18.629
WHILE WE TURN THIS DUMP
INTO AN ACTUAL HOME.

08:18.629 --> 08:21.031
OKAY, PEOPLE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.
LET'S GO!

08:21.031 --> 08:23.834
COME ON. HEY, YOU, TOO, TOM.

08:23.834 --> 08:25.135
I'M HOLDING THE BABY.

08:25.135 --> 08:27.137
WELL, SPRAY HER
WITH SOME GLASS CLEANER

08:27.137 --> 08:29.139
AND RUB HER ON THE WINDOWS.

08:29.139 --> 08:31.842
I DON'T WANT RENEE TO KNOW
I LIVE LIKE THIS.

08:31.842 --> 08:33.844
BUT, MOM,
IF SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

08:33.844 --> 08:37.948
WON'T SHE LIKE YOU
NO MATTER HOW YOU LIVE?
 SHE'S NOT THAT KIND OF FRIEND.

08:39.289 --> 08:42.292
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE
WHO'S BACK.

08:42.292 --> 08:44.154
HERE WE ARE.

08:44.154 --> 08:47.027
HOME SWEET...

08:47.027 --> 08:49.730
HOME.

08:49.730 --> 08:53.033
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK,
BUDDY?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.004
(door closes)

08:54.004 --> 08:56.266
THIS IS WHERE
WE'RE GONNA LIVE?

08:56.266 --> 08:58.208
YEAH.

09:00.811 --> 09:03.043
SO ARE WE POOR?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.045
(under breath)
IF YOU FIELD THIS ONE,

09:05.045 --> 09:08.148
I'LL TELL HIM
WHERE BABIES COME FROM.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.250
(sighs)

09:10.250 --> 09:13.153
NO, HONEY, WE'RE NOT POOR.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.254
WE'RE JUST...

09:14.254 --> 09:17.027
LOWER MIDDLE CLASS.

09:17.027 --> 09:19.559
POOR PEOPLE WISH
 THEY COULD LIVE LIKE THIS.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.892
THEY SHOULDN'T.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.193
OH, SWEETIE.

09:23.193 --> 09:25.736
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
WHAT WE'RE USED TO.

09:25.736 --> 09:27.738
BUDDY, WE'RE NOT
GONNA LIE TO YOU.

09:27.738 --> 09:29.670
MONEY IS A LITTLE TIGHTER
THAN BEFORE,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.672
BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE--

09:31.672 --> 09:34.104
SO WE CAN SAVE UP
AND GET BACK TO OUR HOUSE.

09:34.104 --> 09:36.106
AND IT'S NOT GONNA TAKE
THAT LONG.

09:36.106 --> 09:37.878
YOUR DADDY'S TAKING ON
EXTRA JOBS,

09:37.878 --> 09:40.180
AND I'M STILL TEACHING,
 AND I'M GONNA START SELLING

09:40.180 --> 09:43.153
THAT REALLY COOL JEWELRY
I'VE BEEN MAKING.

09:43.153 --> 09:44.915
OH, GOD.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.717
(cell phone ringing)

09:46.717 --> 09:49.159
SWEETIE,
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

09:49.159 --> 09:53.724
AND AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER,
WE CAN SURVIVE THIS.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.325
(ring, beep)

09:55.325 --> 09:57.167
HELLO?
 (Karen) Susan!

09:57.167 --> 09:59.169
HI, MRS. McCLUSKEY. WHAT'S UP?

09:59.169 --> 10:02.372
You'll never believe this.
Paul Young is back.
 WHAT?!

10:02.372 --> 10:03.373
(tires screech)

10:03.373 --> 10:05.075
(engine turns off)

10:05.075 --> 10:07.077
WHERE IS HE?

10:07.077 --> 10:10.080
WHERE DO YOU THINK? HE'S IN
THE HOUSE YOU RENTED TO HIM.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.013
I DIDN'T KNOW. LEE JUST TOLD ME
IT WAS A GUY.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.815
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK
FOR HIS NAME?

10:14.815 --> 10:17.648
HE PAID IN ADVANCE, AND HE
DIDN'T HAVE PETS. I DIDN'T CARE.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.619
HOW IS PAUL EVEN OUT OF JAIL?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.822
THAT MANIAC WAS SERVING
A LIFE SENTENCE.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.854
(Paul) HELLO, LADIES.

10:23.854 --> 10:26.156
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME IN
FOR A WHILE,

10:26.156 --> 10:28.158
I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.102
COME ON NOW.

10:32.102 --> 10:34.034
IT'S A GOOD ONE.

10:36.066 --> 10:38.068
FELICIA TILLMAN'S ALIVE?

10:38.068 --> 10:40.070
WHY ARE YOU SO SURPRISED?

10:40.070 --> 10:42.813
I SAID THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN
IN MY TRIAL.

10:42.813 --> 10:44.114
OH, WAIT. THAT'S RIGHT.

10:44.114 --> 10:47.317
NONE OF YOU COULD MAKE IT
TO THE COURTHOUSE.

10:47.317 --> 10:48.879
LOOK, PAUL--

10:48.879 --> 10:52.753
IT'S OKAY.
YOU WERE BUSY. I GET IT.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.055
I TOLD MYSELF I'D EXPLAIN
HOW I WAS FRAMED

10:55.055 --> 10:58.158
WHEN YOU CAME TO VISIT ME
IN PRISON. (scoffs) OH, WAIT.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.861
WE'RE SO SORRY.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.736
IN OUR DEFENSE, WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

11:05.736 --> 11:07.337
(chuckles)

11:09.139 --> 11:11.441
WHAT YOU ENDURED
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS--

11:11.441 --> 11:14.044
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IT.

11:14.044 --> 11:17.808
NO, YOU CAN'T.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.810
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I'M BACK.

11:19.810 --> 11:20.951
(pills rattle)

11:22.182 --> 11:26.686
YEAH, ABOUT THAT, UM, WHY DID
YOU WANNA COME BACK HERE?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.719
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK?

11:28.719 --> 11:30.020
I MISSED MY FRIENDS.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.162
(chuckles)

11:32.162 --> 11:35.165
INNOCENT OR NOT, THAT GUY
STILL GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

11:35.165 --> 11:38.168
I CAN'T BELIEVE PAUL YOUNG
IS BACK ON WISTERIA LANE.

11:38.168 --> 11:40.901
AND HE'S USING MY SHOWER.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.805
(women speaking inaudibly)

11:56.216 --> 11:57.447
JACK!

11:59.119 --> 12:02.122
YOU HERE FOR YOUR 9 IRON?
DAMN, I THOUGHT IF I SHAVED,

12:02.122 --> 12:05.225
YOU'D WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE ME
AND I COULD KEEP IT.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.059
ACTUALLY, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU AND YOUR WIFE.

12:09.059 --> 12:11.101
HEY, GABY!

12:11.101 --> 12:13.263
IN A MINUTE!

12:13.263 --> 12:16.106
YOU LOOK A LITTLE PALE, BUDDY.
SOMETHING WRONG?

12:16.106 --> 12:19.039
(sighs) I THINK
WE SHOULD WAIT FOR GABY.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.311
JACK, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,
MAN?

12:21.311 --> 12:23.013
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

12:23.013 --> 12:25.015
LET'S JUST GO INSIDE, HMM?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.148
NO! THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.121
WE STILL HAVE THE BRACELET
THEY PUT AROUND JUANITA'S ANKLE

12:31.121 --> 12:33.123
IN THE HOSPITAL.

12:33.123 --> 12:36.056
THERESA PRUITT WAS THE NURSE
IN CHARGE OF THOSE BRACELETS,

12:36.056 --> 12:38.428
AND ALTHOUGH THE HOSPITAL
DID NOT KNOW THIS AT THE TIME,

12:38.428 --> 12:40.160
SHE HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.863
AND EIGHT YEARS LATER,
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.265
I'VE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
LOVING SOMEONE ELSE'S DAUGHTER!

12:45.265 --> 12:49.099
AGAIN, I WANNA STRESS
THAT THE HOSPITAL

12:49.099 --> 12:50.400
ONLY BELATEDLY BECAME--

12:50.400 --> 12:53.173
JACK, I SWEAR TO GOD,
IF YOU GO LAWYER ON ME,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.375
I WILL PUT YOUR HEAD
THROUGH A WALL!

12:59.149 --> 13:01.211
(speaking inaudibly)
 (sighs)

13:01.211 --> 13:05.355
SO WHERE IS OUR...

13:05.355 --> 13:08.318
BIOLOGI--GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO CALL HER.

13:08.318 --> 13:12.322
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO TRACK
THE FAMILY DOWN YET.
 THEN WE'RE NOT TELLING GABY,

13:12.322 --> 13:14.564
NOT TILL YOU FIND
THIS OTHER GIRL.

13:14.564 --> 13:17.067
CARLOS, I HAVE
A LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY HERE.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.069
SHE HAS TO BE TOLD.

13:19.069 --> 13:21.401
FINE! I'LL DO IT.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.409
(sighs) BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

13:29.409 --> 13:33.113
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY HER.

13:44.054 --> 13:47.157
NOPE. I WAS WRONG. PRESTON,
SWITCH BACK WITH PARKER.

13:47.157 --> 13:50.300
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
 WHEN RENEE PULLS UP
TO THIS HOUSE,

13:50.300 --> 13:53.233
SHE IS GONNA SEE THE ONE THING
I CAN SHOW OFF--

13:53.233 --> 13:56.466
MY BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

13:56.466 --> 14:00.240
WHAT IS THAT, A PIMPLE?
GET IN THE BACK!

14:00.240 --> 14:03.914
HONEY, DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
GETTING A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY?

14:03.914 --> 14:05.916
TOM, THAT WOMAN
LIVES IN A PENTHOUSE.

14:05.916 --> 14:09.179
WE HAD TO GIVE UP MEAT
SO WE COULD BUY A LAPTOP.

14:09.179 --> 14:12.252
LET ME HAVE THIS.
 IS THAT HER?

14:14.154 --> 14:17.387
(scoffs) OF COURSE IT IS.

14:17.387 --> 14:20.260
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
SMILE FOR MOM

14:20.260 --> 14:24.234
AND HER STRANGE
AND TWISTED FRIENDSHIP.

14:30.270 --> 14:31.401
OH! HI!

14:31.401 --> 14:33.103
I'M BACK, RUDOLFO.

14:33.103 --> 14:36.646
PLEASE TELL SIGNOR CIPRIANI
I ALWAYS STAY IN THAT SUITE

14:36.646 --> 14:39.179
WHEN I VISIT VENICE,
AND IF IT'S NOT AVAILABLE,

14:39.179 --> 14:40.480
I'LL BE VERY UNHAPPY.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.313
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
THERE'S SOMEONE MORE IMPORTANT

14:43.313 --> 14:45.485
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.917
HI!

14:46.917 --> 14:48.388
HEY, JOSE.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.660
THANKS FOR HOLDING.
LOOK, I CAN'T DO THURSDAY.

14:50.660 --> 14:51.891
SO--

14:51.891 --> 14:53.663
JOSE, SHE'LL CALL YOU BACK.
 (beep)

14:53.663 --> 14:55.665
LYNETTE,
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

14:55.665 --> 14:58.198
NEITHER HAVE YOU.
(laughs)

14:58.198 --> 14:59.269
HI, SWEETIE.

14:59.269 --> 15:00.570
(gasps)

15:00.570 --> 15:03.203
OH, NO, PLEASE TELL ME

15:03.203 --> 15:07.237
YOU DIDN'T DUMP TOM FOR THIS
HANDSOME, YOUNG TROPHY HUSBAND.

15:07.237 --> 15:10.110
IT'S ME, RENEE. (laughs)

15:10.110 --> 15:13.113
I MEAN, I DO WORK OUT,
LIKE, THREE TIMES A WEEK,

15:13.113 --> 15:15.215
SO MAYBE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE--

15:15.215 --> 15:16.686
OH, OKAY.

15:16.686 --> 15:18.688
ARE THESE YOUR KIDS?
 YEAH.

15:18.688 --> 15:20.690
(gasps)
 YES, AND HERE

15:20.690 --> 15:23.493
IS OUR LATEST ADDITION.

15:23.493 --> 15:26.296
OH, SHE'S PRECIOUS.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.158
(laughs)

15:28.158 --> 15:31.661
LOOK AT YOU ALL--WHAT A PERFECT
LITTLE SUBURBAN PICTURE.

15:31.661 --> 15:35.435
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN BLESSED.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.937
VERY BLESSED.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.171
I'M SORRY I GOTTA RUN, RENEE,
BUT I'M LATE FOR WORK.

15:41.171 --> 15:45.075
WORK? AND I THOUGHT YOU WORE
THAT SEXY TIE JUST FOR ME.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.376
YOU LIKE IT?

15:46.376 --> 15:49.079
THEY--THEY SAY THAT
BOLDER COLORS ARE COMING BACK,

15:49.079 --> 15:51.581
SO I THOUGHT I'D...
OKAY.

15:51.581 --> 15:53.083
BYE.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.084
(Tom) BYE.

15:54.084 --> 15:55.385
LOVE YOU.
 (door closes)

15:55.385 --> 15:57.387
OH, I GOTTA SAY, LYNETTE,

15:57.387 --> 15:59.259
THIS PLACE IS ADORABLE.

15:59.259 --> 16:03.293
IT'S SO... COZY
AND INTIMATE AND...

16:03.293 --> 16:04.964
PAY ATTENTION, KIDS.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.267
YOU'RE LEARNING A LOT
OF NEW WORDS FOR "SMALL."

16:07.267 --> 16:09.269
OH, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.272
I HATE BANGING AROUND
MY LONELY OLD BARN OF A HOUSE.

16:12.272 --> 16:16.246
SOMETIMES WEEKS GO BY WITHOUT
ME RUNNING INTO A SERVANT.

16:16.246 --> 16:18.708
I'M SURE YOU SEE THEM
ON WHIPPING DAY.

16:18.708 --> 16:20.210
LYNETTE, WHY SO MEAN?

16:20.210 --> 16:24.254
I WORKED ON THESE COMPLIMENTS
ALL THE WAY FROM THE AIRPORT.

16:24.254 --> 16:25.755
DRIVE SLOWER NEXT TIME.

16:25.755 --> 16:27.287
MOM.

16:27.287 --> 16:31.121
IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE'RE JUST
OLD FRIENDS RECONNECTING.

16:31.121 --> 16:34.124
AND I'M BEING SINCERE.
THIS IS THE WAY TO GO--

16:34.124 --> 16:35.565
STRIPPED DOWN
TO THE BARE ESSENTIALS.

16:35.565 --> 16:38.168
YOU KNOW, MORE PEOPLE
SHOULD LIVE LIKE THIS.

16:38.168 --> 16:40.730
(chuckles) MOST PEOPLE
 DO LIVE LIKE THIS.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.732
WHEN YOU'RE FLYING
IN YOUR PRIVATE JET,

16:42.732 --> 16:46.336
AND YOU LOOK DOWN AND GO, "WOW,
THEY LOOK LIKE ANTS DOWN THERE,"

16:46.336 --> 16:48.038
WE'RE THE ANTS.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.410
SO YOU HAVE A PRIVATE JET?

16:50.410 --> 16:53.143
WELL, IT'S NOT JUST OURS.
WE SHARE IT WITH THE TEAM.

16:53.143 --> 16:56.186
WAIT. SO YOU GET TO HANG OUT
WITH THE YANKEES?

16:56.186 --> 16:57.647
THAT'S AWESOME.
 HOW IS DOUG, BY THE WAY?

16:57.647 --> 17:00.250
OH, HE'S FINE,
BUT ALL THAT STUFF--

17:00.250 --> 17:03.793
THE TEAM, THE JET, THE MONEY--
IT'S LIKE A FANTASY WORLD.

17:03.793 --> 17:07.696
THIS IS WHAT I YEARN FOR.
THIS IS REAL.

17:07.696 --> 17:12.232
THIS IS... (chuckles)
STICKY.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.534
SO YOU'RE STAYING
IN A REALLY FANCY HOTEL?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
WELL, I CAME STRAIGHT
FROM THE AIRPORT,

17:16.536 --> 17:19.169
SO I HAVEN'T BOOKED
A HOTEL YET.

17:19.169 --> 17:20.540
OH, WHY DON'T YOU STAY
WITH US?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.541
OH, I'M SURE
RENEE WOULDN'T WANT--

17:22.541 --> 17:24.644
I WOULD LOVE TO.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.476
ARE YOU SURE?

17:26.476 --> 17:29.549
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, FIVE KIDS--
IT GETS STICKIER.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.251
OH, I DON'T MIND.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.552
IT'D BE FUN.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.256
I'VE GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP
TO DO WITH MY OLD, OLD FRIEND.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.727
(laughs)

17:37.727 --> 17:40.660
BY THE WAY, I HAVE
A DOCTOR WHO CAN GET RID

17:40.660 --> 17:42.632
OF ONE OF THOSE "OLDs."

17:42.632 --> 17:45.135
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS
I CAN SET YOU UP

17:45.135 --> 17:47.397
ON THE SLEEPER SOFA.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.399
SLEEPER SOFA? OOH.
LOOK AT ME.

17:49.399 --> 17:51.701
I'M ONE OF THE ANTS.

17:51.701 --> 17:54.644
(dog barking in distance)

17:54.644 --> 17:57.277
HI. YOU OWN
THE BUILDING, RIGHT?

17:57.277 --> 18:00.180
I'M SUSAN DELFINO. MY HUSBAND
MIKE AND I ARE IN 1B.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.212
JIGGLE THE HANDLE.
THE TOILET'S FINE.

18:02.212 --> 18:03.713
OH, NO, NO, NO.

18:03.713 --> 18:05.615
I'M JUST DROPPING OFF
THE SECURITY DEPOSIT.

18:05.615 --> 18:08.488
SORRY IT'S LATE. WE'VE BEEN
HAVING SOME MONEY PROBLEMS.

18:08.488 --> 18:12.122
HAVE YOU?

18:12.122 --> 18:13.323
(sighs)

18:13.323 --> 18:16.166
WELL, I'M MAXINE.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.468
COME ON IN.
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME TEA.

18:18.468 --> 18:20.270
THANKS.
 COME ON.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.803
THAT IS SUCH A SHAME
ABOUT MIKE'S BUSINESS.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.805
AND HERE YOU ARE,
WITH NO SKILLS,

18:25.805 --> 18:29.239
TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET.
 MM. OH, I HAVE SKILLS.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.881
I MAKE MY OWN JEWELRY.
I MADE THIS.

18:31.881 --> 18:34.544
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

18:34.544 --> 18:36.646
I REALLY CAN. (chuckles)

18:36.646 --> 18:40.250
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER WHEN
MY HUSBAND SIDNEY PASSED AWAY.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.122
HIS ILLNESS TOOK EVERY DIME
WE HAD.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.425
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS GONNA DO.

18:45.425 --> 18:47.427
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU DID OKAY.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.259
I MEAN,
YOU OWN THE BUILDING.

18:49.259 --> 18:51.261
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I STOPPED POUTING.

18:51.261 --> 18:55.335
I GOT OFF MY TUCHIS,
AND I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS.

18:55.335 --> 18:58.338
AND NOW I'M ABLE TO HELP
OTHER STRUGGLING WOMEN.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.340
YOU KNOW,
THEY SET THEIR OWN HOURS.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.342
THEY WORK
FROM THEIR OWN HOMES.

19:02.342 --> 19:06.576
AND OH, YOY, YOY,
THE MONEY. (laughs)

19:06.576 --> 19:08.748
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A DREAM JOB.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.681
I'LL BET YOU'D BE
REAL GOOD AT IT.

19:11.681 --> 19:13.183
LET ME SHOW YOU.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.684
ARE THERE PHONES INVOLVED?

19:14.684 --> 19:17.187
I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE
AN EXCELLENT PHONE VOICE.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.929
UH, "HELLO.
CAN I INTEREST YOU IN A..."

19:22.192 --> 19:24.294
OH, MY GOD.

19:29.199 --> 19:31.201
IT'S MY WEB SITE!

19:31.201 --> 19:33.743
Va-Va-Va-Broom.com.

19:33.743 --> 19:36.246
I GOT A 10-UNIT MAC PRO
SERVER FARM

19:36.246 --> 19:39.809
AND A 1.5-MEG T1 LINE.

19:39.809 --> 19:42.312
YOU RUN A PORN SITE?

19:42.312 --> 19:45.215
YOU'RE TRYING TO LURE ME
INTO PORNOGRAPHY?

19:45.215 --> 19:47.917
OH, MY GOD! DID YOU SLIP
SOMETHING INTO MY TEA?

19:47.917 --> 19:51.461
HONEY, RELAX.
THIS IS STRICTLY P.G.--

19:51.461 --> 19:53.763
WOMEN DOING HOUSEWORK
IN LINGERIE,

19:53.763 --> 19:55.765
NO NUDITY, NO SEX.

19:55.765 --> 19:57.227
SO?

19:57.227 --> 19:59.229
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

19:59.229 --> 20:01.371
WHAT DO I SAY?

20:01.371 --> 20:03.503
I SAY... SHAME!

20:03.503 --> 20:05.204
SHAME ON YOU!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.206
THESE ARE
NICE, RESPECTABLE GIRLS

20:07.206 --> 20:08.608

20:09.879 --> 20:13.383
DEIRDRE'S GOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL
TO BECOME A NURSE,

20:13.383 --> 20:16.916
AND MARTHA'S TRYING TO
START OVER AFTER A DIVORCE.

20:16.916 --> 20:20.219
DON'T THEY WORRY ABOUT PEOPLE
THEY KNOW SEEING THEM?

20:20.219 --> 20:22.221
MOST OF OUR CLIENTS
ARE OVERSEAS--

20:22.221 --> 20:23.753
YOU KNOW, EUROPE, ASIA.

20:23.753 --> 20:27.657
SO IF YOU GO TO KUALA LUMPUR,
WEAR A HAT.

20:27.657 --> 20:28.998
(chuckles) COME ON.

20:28.998 --> 20:33.363
YOU SAID YOU HAD
MONEY PROBLEMS.

20:33.363 --> 20:36.406
HERE'S WHAT MARTHA MAKES
IN A WEEK.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.538
HMM?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.240
WHOA.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.242
(gasps)

20:43.242 --> 20:44.814
WOE...

20:44.814 --> 20:46.816
UNTO MARTHA
FOR SELLING HER DIGNITY

20:46.816 --> 20:48.948
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.950
I PROMISE,
YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING

20:50.950 --> 20:53.853
I WOULDN'T LET
MY OWN DAUGHTER DO!

20:53.853 --> 20:58.458
LOOK FOR YOURSELF!
SHE'S ON CAMERA THREE!

21:06.896 --> 21:09.739
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

21:09.739 --> 21:13.343
JUST SOME FAMILY PHOTOS.

21:13.343 --> 21:15.945
THAT'S YOU
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

21:15.945 --> 21:18.277
HMM.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.310
DADDY? WHO'S THAT?

21:20.310 --> 21:21.811
THAT'S YOUR GRANDMA.

21:21.811 --> 21:24.514
OH.

21:24.514 --> 21:26.516
I WISH I HAD MET HER.

21:26.516 --> 21:28.518
YOU WOULD'VE LOVED HER.

21:30.660 --> 21:33.393
DO YOU THINK ABOUT HER
A LOT?

21:33.393 --> 21:34.364
EVERY DAY.

21:34.364 --> 21:37.597
SHE WAS THE LIGHT
OF MY LIFE,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.769
AND THAT'S WHY WE NAMED YOU
AFTER HER,

21:39.769 --> 21:41.771
BECAUSE I COULD NOT
IMAGINE A WORLD

21:41.771 --> 21:43.773
WITHOUT A JUANITA SOLIS
IN IT.

21:47.076 --> 21:48.838
HEY.

21:48.838 --> 21:50.980
DO YOU WANT ME TO TUCK HER IN?

21:50.980 --> 21:53.783
NO, I'LL DO IT. COME ON.

22:01.050 --> 22:04.424
AMY AND I WANT TO GO
TO THE MALL TOMORROW.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.556
OH, SORRY, HON.
I HAVE PLANS.

22:06.556 --> 22:08.027
I COULD RIDE MY BIKE.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.360
BY YOURSELF?
I DON'T THINK SO.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.331
WHY NOT?

22:12.331 --> 22:14.404
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.
THAT'S WHY NOT.

22:14.404 --> 22:16.566
YOU'RE MEAN.

22:16.566 --> 22:18.568
WELL,
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO BE MEAN

22:18.568 --> 22:20.370
'CAUSE IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT YOU.

22:20.370 --> 22:22.372
WHAT IF YOU GOT HIT
BY A BUS?

22:22.372 --> 22:23.913
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

22:23.913 --> 22:25.915
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

22:25.915 --> 22:29.078
YOU ARE MY WHOLE WORLD.

22:29.078 --> 22:33.553
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU,
IT WOULD RUIN MY LIFE.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.054
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

22:48.738 --> 22:51.401
(sighs) WELL...

22:51.401 --> 22:53.703
THAT'S THE LAST OF IT.

22:53.703 --> 22:57.777
I'LL PUT THESE BOOKS IN THE CAR.
PLEASURE MEETING YOU, BREE.

22:57.777 --> 23:01.611
NICE OF YOUR PHYSICAL THERAPIST
TO HELP WITH THE MOVE.

23:01.611 --> 23:07.457
SO ARE YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

23:07.457 --> 23:10.820
LET'S SEE.
UH, I'M GETTING A DIVORCE.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.423
I LOST MY BUSINESS,
AND I'M SITTING HERE

23:13.423 --> 23:15.425
TRYING TO REMEMBER WHY
I QUIT DRINKING.

23:15.425 --> 23:18.768
I'VE HAD BETTER MONDAYS.

23:18.768 --> 23:20.800
I'M SORRY.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.432
DON'T BE.

23:23.873 --> 23:25.735
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.140
WE HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY
FOR A LONG TIME.

23:31.140 --> 23:35.945
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

23:35.945 --> 23:37.517
A PROJECT.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.490
NO. (chuckles)
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS DO--

23:40.490 --> 23:42.752
DISTRACT MYSELF
WITH MEANINGLESS BUSYWORK

23:42.752 --> 23:46.896
AS A WAY OF AVOIDING
MY... EMOTIONS.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.102
I THINK
I NEED TO SIT QUIETLY

23:53.102 --> 23:56.435
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT
I'M GONNA DO WITH MY LIFE.

23:56.435 --> 24:01.110
WELL, WHATEVER YOU DO...

24:01.110 --> 24:03.673
I KNOW IT'LL BE SPECTACULAR.

24:14.524 --> 24:16.125
(whispers) GOOD-BYE, BREE.

24:26.095 --> 24:27.597
(door closes)

25:49.548 --> 25:51.681
(telephone rings)

25:51.681 --> 25:53.282
HI, BREE.

25:53.282 --> 25:55.985
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
OUR CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT.

25:55.985 --> 25:58.227
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING.

25:58.227 --> 25:59.859
I'M FINE.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.861
IN FACT, I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

26:01.861 --> 26:06.796
I FOUND MYSELF A PROJECT.

26:15.905 --> 26:18.077
I'M SURPRISED
YOU AGREED TO SEE ME.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.079
I WANTED TO SPIT
IN YOUR FACE.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.581
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE'D BE GLASS.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.353
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT USED
TO PRISON. GIVE YOURSELF TIME.

26:24.353 --> 26:27.056
WHAT IS IT NOW--
TWO TO FIVE YEARS?

26:27.056 --> 26:29.058
18 MONTHS
WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR.

26:29.058 --> 26:31.060
YOU'RE GIVING ME
A LOT OF REASONS

26:31.060 --> 26:33.222
TO BE
EXTREMELY WELL BEHAVED.

26:33.222 --> 26:36.225
MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU
A FEW POINTERS ON PRISON LIFE.

26:36.225 --> 26:39.769
I'VE BECOME A BIT OF AN EXPERT
THANKS TO YOU. HEY, HERE'S ONE.

26:39.769 --> 26:42.601
IT NEVER HURTS TO TIP THE GUARD
WHO DOES YOUR CAVITY SEARCH.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.035
LISTEN TO ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

26:46.035 --> 26:48.638
I DON'T CARE
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

26:48.638 --> 26:53.813
I WILL SEE YOU
BEHIND BARS AGAIN, OR DEAD...

26:53.813 --> 26:57.216
WHICHEVER IS EASIER.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.718
HERE'S ANOTHER POINTER.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.090
THEY ALWAYS RECORD
THE CONVERSATIONS,

27:01.090 --> 27:03.853
SO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
THREATENING THE MAN YOU FRAMED.

27:03.853 --> 27:06.095
YOU MURDERED MY SISTER.

27:06.095 --> 27:09.098
(chuckles) THAT'S A CRAZY,
GROUNDLESS ACCUSATION.

27:09.098 --> 27:11.100
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

27:11.100 --> 27:13.102
I HAVE THINGS TO DO
LIKE SHOPPING

27:13.102 --> 27:15.104
AND WALKING AROUND
IN THE OPEN AIR

27:15.104 --> 27:17.106
WITHOUT A CARE IN THE WORLD.

27:17.106 --> 27:19.869
YOU KNOW YOU DID IT.

27:23.272 --> 27:25.214
(mouths words)

27:29.318 --> 27:32.321
WOW, THEY'RE ALL SO... BIG.

27:32.321 --> 27:34.283
EXACTLY. THANK YOU.

27:34.283 --> 27:36.826
YOU'RE WELCOME?
 OH, I KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULD GET IT,

27:36.826 --> 27:39.658
UNLIKE THOSE IDIOTS THAT WALKED
BY MY CARD TABLE IN THE PARK.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.161
IT'S NOT JEWELRY.
IT'S WEARABLE ART.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.835
SO... WHO WANTS TO TRY
THESE EARRINGS?

27:45.835 --> 27:48.297
OH, UH, I'M NOT SURE
THAT MY DELICATE EARS

27:48.297 --> 27:50.870
CAN SUPPORT SOMETHING SO LARGE.

27:52.241 --> 27:53.973
HOW ABOUT GABY?

27:53.973 --> 27:56.976
SHE HAS
BIG, STRONG, LATINO EARS.

27:59.148 --> 28:01.150
LYNETTE, WHERE IS
THIS FRIEND OF YOURS?

28:01.150 --> 28:03.152
WE'RE ALL DYING
TO MEET HER.

28:03.152 --> 28:05.184
COME ON.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.316
I NEED A VOLUNTEER.
LYNETTE?

28:07.316 --> 28:08.687
YES!

28:08.687 --> 28:10.459
OH.
 I GUESS.

28:12.121 --> 28:14.023
HOW'S IT FEEL?

28:14.023 --> 28:17.396
ABOUT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS,
I'M GUESSING. I'LL TAKE 'EM.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.397
YES!

28:18.397 --> 28:21.270
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GETTING?

28:21.270 --> 28:24.834
I'M GONNA BUY THIS...
FOR BREE

28:24.834 --> 28:27.276
AND HER STRONG,
PROTESTANT NECK.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.211
OH, YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.213
OH, HEY, HERE SHE IS.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.714
OKAY, SUSAN, BREE, GABY,

28:35.714 --> 28:38.788
THIS IS MY OLD COLLEGE ROOMMATE,
RENEE.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.790
HI. IT IS SO NICE
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

28:40.790 --> 28:43.392
LYNETTE HAS TALKED SO MUCH
ABOUT HER FRIEND FROM COLLEGE.

28:43.392 --> 28:45.394
OH, YES, YOU KNOW HOW
IN SCHOOL

28:45.394 --> 28:48.097
THE PRETTY GIRLS
ALWAYS HANG OUT TOGETHER?

28:48.097 --> 28:50.399
WELL, I REFUSED
TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.

28:50.399 --> 28:53.132
(Lynette laughs)

28:53.132 --> 28:55.134
RENEE COMES OFF
A LITTLE STUCK UP

28:55.134 --> 28:57.066
WHEN YOU FIRST MEET HER,
WHICH IS A REAL TIME-SAVER.

28:57.066 --> 28:58.968
SIT DOWN!

28:58.968 --> 29:00.970
SO, RENEE, YOU HAVE TO TELL US.

29:00.970 --> 29:03.973
WHAT WAS LYNETTE LIKE
IN COLLEGE?

29:03.973 --> 29:05.274
UH, ABSOLUTELY FEARLESS.

29:05.274 --> 29:07.276
SHE JUST KEPT WEARING
THOSE PARACHUTE PANTS,

29:07.276 --> 29:10.319
LESBIAN RUMORS BE DAMNED.

29:10.319 --> 29:13.422
(laughs) YES, RENEE WAS ALWAYS
THE ONE WITH THE FASHION SENSE.

29:13.422 --> 29:16.385
BEFORE I MET HER, I'D NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF GUCCI OR PRADA...

29:16.385 --> 29:18.487
OR CHLAMYDIA.

29:18.487 --> 29:21.861
WOW, YOU GUYS PLAY ROUGH.

29:21.861 --> 29:25.264
NO, IT'S JUST WHAT WE DO.
IT'S FUN.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.267
I TEASE HER ABOUT BEING
ALL BOTULISM FROM THE NOSE UP...

29:28.267 --> 29:30.970
AND I TEASE HER ABOUT BEING
ALL COTTAGE CHEESE

29:30.970 --> 29:32.241
FROM THE WAIST DOWN.

29:32.241 --> 29:37.276
(laughs) SO, RENEE, WE HEAR THAT
YOU'RE MARRIED TO DOUG PERRY?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.108
THE BASEBALL PLAYER?

29:39.108 --> 29:40.409
NO SURPRISE THERE.

29:40.409 --> 29:43.412
IN OUR SORORITY, RENEE WAS VOTED
MOST LIKELY TO MARRY WELL.

29:43.412 --> 29:46.515
AND LYNETTE WAS VOTED
MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.

29:46.515 --> 29:48.117
(chuckles)

29:48.117 --> 29:49.288
AW.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.991
SO, BREE, I HEAR
YOU'RE AN AMAZING COOK.

29:51.991 --> 29:55.194
HANG ON A SECOND.
WHAT WAS THAT?

29:55.194 --> 29:56.265
WHAT?

29:56.265 --> 29:58.297
THAT... "AW."

29:58.297 --> 29:59.298
OH, NOTHING.

29:59.298 --> 30:03.002
I JUST DIDN'T WANNA...
MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.333
ABOUT WHAT?

30:04.333 --> 30:06.335
WELL, IT--
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

30:06.335 --> 30:09.038
I THINK OUR COLLEGE FRIENDS
WOULD BE SURPRISED

30:09.038 --> 30:11.410
TO SEE HOW YOU ENDED UP.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.044
(laughs)

30:15.044 --> 30:17.446
OH, I THOUGHT
THEY WERE STILL PLAYING.

30:17.446 --> 30:21.851
YOU KNOW, RENEE, I HAVE HAD
A CAREER AND RAISED A FAMILY.

30:21.851 --> 30:23.352
AND THAT'S GREAT.

30:23.352 --> 30:26.195
IT'S JUST THAT WE HAD
SUCH HIGH HOPES FOR YOU.

30:26.195 --> 30:28.497
AT LEAST I DIDN'T SPEND
THE LAST 15 YEARS

30:28.497 --> 30:32.201
SPONGING OFF A RICH GUY.
 HEY, LET'S STOP
BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

30:32.201 --> 30:34.133
WHATEVER I GOT,
I GOT ON MY OWN.

30:34.133 --> 30:36.135
AND WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

30:36.135 --> 30:38.437
A BLOUSE FROM THE "I'VE STOPPED
TRYING" COLLECTION

30:38.437 --> 30:41.140
AND A PAIR OF EARRINGS
YOUR KID MADE AT CAMP?

30:41.140 --> 30:42.611
AND... SOMEBODY GOT HURT.

30:42.611 --> 30:45.614
THAT'S GREAT. EASY SHOTS.
YOU GOT MORE MONEY THAN ME.

30:45.614 --> 30:47.616
OH, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.

30:47.616 --> 30:50.619
THE LYNETTE I KNEW NEVER
WOULD HAVE SETTLED FOR THIS.

30:50.619 --> 30:52.381
YOU WERE ADVENTUROUS.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.053
YOU BACKPACKED
THROUGH CROATIA.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.456
YOU JUMPED ONSTAGE
AT A SPRINGSTEEN CONCERT.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.189
IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME
TO RECONCILE

31:00.189 --> 31:02.491
THIS SUBURBAN HOUSEWIFE
WITH THE GIRL...
 (door opens)

31:02.491 --> 31:06.295
WHO HAD A THREESOME WITH TWO
OF THE GUYS FROM THE RUGBY TEAM.

31:06.295 --> 31:09.268
(thud)

31:19.078 --> 31:21.080
WHY WOULD SHE DO THIS?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.082
WHY WOULD SHE JUMP
IN A PRIVATE JET

31:23.082 --> 31:25.084
AND FLY ALL THE WAY
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

31:25.084 --> 31:27.086
JUST TO DUMP ON MY LIFE?

31:27.086 --> 31:29.959
TWO GUYS, HUH?
 WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

31:29.959 --> 31:31.961
I MEAN, ISN'T HER LIFE
PERFECT ENOUGH?

31:31.961 --> 31:34.263
DOES SHE REALLY NEED
TO SCORE BONUS POINTS

31:34.263 --> 31:35.965
BY TAKING ME DOWN?

31:35.965 --> 31:38.227
SO WAS IT ONE RUGBY GUY
AND THEN THE OTHER,

31:38.227 --> 31:40.399
OR JUST SORT OF A-A SCRUM?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.900
OH, DROP IT, TOM.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.672
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE SHIELDED YOU

31:43.672 --> 31:46.135
FROM SOME OF THE WILDER THINGS
THAT I'VE DONE,

31:46.135 --> 31:48.137
LIKE THAT TIME
AT THE AMUSEMENT PARK--

31:48.137 --> 31:51.140
LITTLE STORY I LIKE TO CALL
"'D' CUPS ON THE TEACUPS."

31:53.042 --> 31:55.284
OKAY, I'M DROPPING IT NOW.

31:55.284 --> 31:56.245
THANK YOU.

31:56.245 --> 31:58.247
WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO UPSET?

31:58.247 --> 32:01.650
I MEAN, I THOUGHT YOU AND RENEE
LOVED TO ZING EACH OTHER.

32:01.650 --> 32:03.352
(gasps) THOSE WEREN'T ZINGS.

32:03.352 --> 32:05.654
WHEN SHE MADE THAT...
(inhales deeply) "AW,"

32:05.654 --> 32:08.257
SHE MEANT IT. I MEAN,
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

32:08.257 --> 32:11.300
SHE DOESN'T GET TO BE
DISAPPOINTED IN MY LIFE.

32:11.300 --> 32:14.333
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.335
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.538
IN FACT, I AM GOING TO TELL HER
A LOT MORE THAN THAT.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.241
GOOD FOR YOU.
BUT WHEN YOU GET BACK,

32:22.241 --> 32:24.543
I'D LIKE TO REVISIT
A CERTAIN REQUEST I MADE

32:24.543 --> 32:28.047
ON MY 40th BIRTHDAY, WHICH,
IN LIGHT OF RECENT REVELATIONS,

32:28.047 --> 32:30.449
SEEMS A LOT MORE...

32:30.449 --> 32:34.253
OKAY. (sighs)

32:37.156 --> 32:39.328
WHAT'S THIS?

32:39.328 --> 32:40.329
YELLOW PAGES.

32:40.329 --> 32:42.291
HOTEL IS UNDER "H."

32:42.291 --> 32:46.996
YEAH, I HAD A FEELING
I HIT A NERVE THIS AFTERNOON.

32:46.996 --> 32:48.998
IF YOU FIND MY LIFE
THAT PATHETIC,

32:48.998 --> 32:52.371
I'M GOING TO SPARE YOU
THE AGONY OF OBSERVING IT.

32:52.371 --> 32:56.105
AND BY THE WAY,
TAXI IS UNDER "T."

32:57.406 --> 33:00.679
LYNETTE, I DON'T THINK
YOUR LIFE IS PATHETIC.

33:00.679 --> 33:04.283
MAYBE NOT,
BUT YOU CLEARLY THINK

33:04.283 --> 33:06.255
YOURS IS A WHOLE LOT BETTER.

33:06.255 --> 33:11.060
SO IF YOU NEED ME TO SAY IT,
I'LL SAY IT. YOU WIN.

33:11.060 --> 33:14.063
YOU GOT THE FABULOUS CLOTHES,
THE PENTHOUSE APARTMENT,

33:14.063 --> 33:15.364
AND THE RICH HUSBAND.

33:15.364 --> 33:17.296
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:17.296 --> 33:20.369
DOUG IS LEAVING ME.

33:23.072 --> 33:25.734
I FOUND OUT
HE WAS CHEATING...

33:25.734 --> 33:29.108
WITH HIS AGENT'S ASSISTANT.

33:29.108 --> 33:32.111
I CONFRONTED HIM,
TOLD HIM IT WAS HER OR ME,

33:32.111 --> 33:35.144
AND HE CHOSE HER.

33:35.144 --> 33:38.147
I THREW SOME THINGS IN A BAG
AND TOOK OFF.

33:38.147 --> 33:41.590
I DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN. I JUST
NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THERE,

33:41.590 --> 33:45.624
AND I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

33:45.624 --> 33:50.529
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS?

33:50.529 --> 33:54.403
LYNETTE, MY LIFE
IS ABOUT TO FALL APART.

33:54.403 --> 33:56.805
I HAVEN'T EVEN ADMITTED IT
TO MYSELF YET.

33:56.805 --> 34:00.239
HOW COULD I TELL YOU?

34:00.239 --> 34:05.144
WELL, OF COURSE YOU CAN
STAY HERE AS LONG AS YOU WANT.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.415
(whispers) THANKS.

34:08.377 --> 34:10.349
(normal voice) AND TO SHOW
MY APPRECIATION,

34:10.349 --> 34:14.052
I WOULD LIKE TO PAY
FOR YOUR FIRST FACE-LIFT.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.755
THAT IS SO GENEROUS.

34:16.755 --> 34:19.158
ALTHOUGH NOW
YOU'VE HAD NINE,

34:19.158 --> 34:21.290
YOU PROBABLY GET
THE NEXT ONE FREE.

34:27.335 --> 34:29.538
HEY, CARLOS. WHAT CAN I--

34:29.538 --> 34:32.541
I'LL MAKE THIS QUICK.
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO OPTIONS.

34:32.541 --> 34:34.773
OPTION ONE--
I SUE THIS HOSPITAL FOR--

34:34.773 --> 34:36.775
I DON'T KNOW--
$10 MILLION, $20 MILLION,

34:36.775 --> 34:39.507
AND I THINK I'LL GET IT.
 THAT WOULD BANKRUPT US.

34:39.507 --> 34:43.351
THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
WANNA GO FOR OPTION TWO.
 WHICH IS?

34:43.351 --> 34:45.214
YOU MAKE THIS WHOLE THING
GO AWAY--

34:45.214 --> 34:48.387
SHRED THE DOCUMENTS, CALL OFF
THE SEARCH FOR THE OTHER FAMILY,

34:48.387 --> 34:50.659
AND NEVER, EVER LET GABY
FIND OUT ABOUT THIS.

34:50.659 --> 34:54.723
CARLOS, WE'VE SENT OUT LETTERS,
HIRED INVESTIGATORS.

34:54.723 --> 34:58.227
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS PROCESS
CAN BE STOPPED.

34:58.227 --> 35:00.599
TRY.
 AND EVEN IF IT COULD,

35:00.599 --> 35:04.102
THIS IS A HELL OF A THING
YOU'RE TAKING ON,

35:04.102 --> 35:06.535
KEEPING THIS SECRET
BY YOURSELF.

35:06.535 --> 35:08.237
WHAT'S MY CHOICE?

35:08.237 --> 35:12.781
IF GABY KNEW THE TRUTH,
IT WOULD KILL HER.

35:12.781 --> 35:16.885
NO. I CAN'T TELL HER.

35:16.885 --> 35:20.389
I CAN'T TELL HIM.
 ARE YOU SURE?

35:20.389 --> 35:23.392
DOESN'T HE DESERVE TO KNOW
WHAT ANDREW DID TO HIS MOTHER?

35:23.392 --> 35:25.824
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND--

35:25.824 --> 35:28.627
CARLOS IS SO HAPPY
RIGHT NOW.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.330
OUR MARRIAGE IS THE BEST
IT'S EVER BEEN.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.631
HE LOVES HIS JOB.

35:32.631 --> 35:37.336
THE GIRLS ARE TURNING OUT
SO BEAUTIFULLY.

35:37.336 --> 35:43.342
EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE
EASILY IGNORABLE BLIP...

35:43.342 --> 35:45.314
OUR LIFE IS PERFECT.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.649
AND I WON'T LET ANYTHING
CHANGE THAT.

35:52.581 --> 35:54.453
PORK CHOPS FOR DINNER.

35:54.453 --> 35:57.155
I KNOW IT WAS A BIT
OF A SPLURGE,

35:57.155 --> 36:00.429
BUT I MADE UP FOR IT--
1-PLY TOILET PAPER. (laughs)

36:01.760 --> 36:03.832
SOMETHING WRONG?

36:03.832 --> 36:06.335
THE BANK TURNED DOWN
MY LOAN APPLICATION.

36:06.335 --> 36:08.497
WITHOUT THAT MONEY,
I CAN'T HIRE ANY HELP.

36:08.497 --> 36:10.199
AND WITHOUT HELP,

36:10.199 --> 36:12.501
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
ONE DINKY JOB AFTER ANOTHER.

36:12.501 --> 36:14.943
WE'LL NEVER GET OUTTA HERE
LIKE THAT.

36:14.943 --> 36:19.248
(sighs)

36:19.248 --> 36:22.781
OKAY.
WELL, WE'LL SCRIMP AND SAVE.

36:24.413 --> 36:27.556
I WON'T BUY PORK CHOPS ANYMORE.
I'M GONNA RETURN THESE.

36:27.556 --> 36:30.859
I'M THINKING ABOUT
TAKING A JOB IN ALASKA.

36:30.859 --> 36:32.391
WHAT?

36:32.391 --> 36:35.394
A BUDDY TOLD ME ABOUT IT--
SIX MONTHS ON AN OIL RIG.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.626
ONE YEAR AT THE MOST.

36:37.626 --> 36:39.798
I COULD MAKE TRIPLE
WHAT I CAN EARN HERE.

36:39.798 --> 36:42.801
YOU CAN PROBABLY MOVE BACK IN
THE HOUSE BEFORE I'M EVEN DONE.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.833
MIKE, THAT IS
 REALLY DANGEROUS WORK.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.976
M.J. NEEDS YOU HERE.
I NEED YOU HERE.

36:47.976 --> 36:50.239
NO, THERE'S GOTTA BE
ANOTHER WAY.

36:50.239 --> 36:52.241
YOU THINK I WANNA GO?

36:52.241 --> 36:54.313
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY GOOD OPTIONS HERE.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.989
GIVE ME A MONTH
BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION.

37:00.989 --> 37:04.353
I'VE JUST GOT A FEELING THAT
THIS JEWELRY THING OF MINE

37:04.353 --> 37:06.455
COULD START PULLING IN
SOME SERIOUS MONEY.

37:06.455 --> 37:09.798
SWEETHEART, YOU'RE TALENTED,
BUT "SERIOUS MONEY"?

37:09.798 --> 37:11.500
YOU'D BE SURPRISED

37:11.500 --> 37:14.563
WHAT SOME PEOPLE
ARE WILLING TO PAY FOR.

37:14.563 --> 37:17.506
(knocking)

37:19.508 --> 37:22.941
NO NUDITY, NO SEX,
AND NO ONE CAN EVER KNOW.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.745
I AM SO GLAD I CAN HELP.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.687
SO WHAT DID YOU
REMOVE THIS WITH--A PUMA?

37:38.687 --> 37:40.689
I WAS ANXIOUS
TO GET RID OF IT.

37:40.689 --> 37:44.433
MY SOON-TO-BE EX-HUSBAND
PICKED OUT MOST OF THE DECOR,

37:44.433 --> 37:46.735
AND I REALIZED
I NEEDED A FRESH START.

37:46.735 --> 37:50.339
YOU KNOW, WALLPAPER'S NICE,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE...

37:50.339 --> 37:52.441
WELL, IT'S YOUR HOUSE,
NOT MINE.

37:52.441 --> 37:55.574
NO, KEITH, PLEASE. I HIRED YOU.
I WANNA HEAR YOUR IDEAS.

37:55.574 --> 37:58.276
I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT YOU PAINT THIS ROOM

37:58.276 --> 38:00.349
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, BOLD.

38:00.349 --> 38:03.512
OH, I LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

38:03.512 --> 38:06.014
PERHAPS A NICE, DEEP BEIGE.

38:06.014 --> 38:07.516
OR... BOLDER.

38:07.516 --> 38:10.519
I MEAN, WITH THE SIZE
OF THIS ROOM AND THE LIGHT,

38:10.519 --> 38:13.522
YOU COULD GO...

38:13.522 --> 38:14.893
SCARLET RED.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.865
PLEASE DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

38:16.865 --> 38:19.868
BUT I'M GOING TO BE
SERVING DINNER IN THIS ROOM,

38:19.868 --> 38:20.869
NOT SAILORS.

38:20.869 --> 38:23.001
(horn honks, car approaches)

38:23.001 --> 38:26.505
COULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR
A MOMENT? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.514
HERE YOU GO--

38:35.514 --> 38:37.616
THE FINAL DIVISION
OF ASSETS.

38:37.616 --> 38:40.949
JUST NEED A JILL HANCOCK
FROM YOU, AND WE'RE ALL SET.

38:40.949 --> 38:42.691
(pen clicks)

38:42.691 --> 38:44.393
UH, BEFORE I FORGET,

38:44.393 --> 38:46.525
ANDREW'S HAVING
A DINNER PARTY ON THE 10th,

38:46.525 --> 38:48.857
AND HE'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO COME.
 (signing paper)

38:48.857 --> 38:50.859
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEPARATING,

38:50.859 --> 38:53.862
WE BOTH WANT YOU TO FEEL THAT
YOU'RE STILL PART OF THE FAMILY.

38:53.862 --> 38:55.834
I'M TOUCHED. THANK YOU, BREE.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.538
ORSON,
DON'T WE HAVE PLANS?

38:59.538 --> 39:01.540
THE WINE TASTING?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.543
UM...

39:04.543 --> 39:05.974
(clears throat)

39:05.974 --> 39:08.477
WHY DON'T YOU WAIT FOR ME
IN THE VAN?

39:11.550 --> 39:15.524
(clears throat)
AS YOU MAY HAVE GLEANED,

39:15.524 --> 39:19.928
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH JUDY
HAS... EVOLVED.

39:19.928 --> 39:23.462
WAS IT EVOLVING WHILE
YOU AND I WERE STILL TOGETHER?

39:23.462 --> 39:25.093
NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

39:25.093 --> 39:27.095
APPARENTLY,
SHE HAD FEELINGS FOR ME,

39:27.095 --> 39:29.468
BUT SHE WAITED
A RESPECTABLE AMOUNT OF TIME

39:29.468 --> 39:32.140
BEFORE EXPRESSING THEM.
 IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

39:32.140 --> 39:35.103
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION
"THE INK'S NOT EVEN DRY"?

39:35.103 --> 39:37.546
IT'S NOT DRY!

39:38.577 --> 39:41.880
WE HAVE SEPARATED, BREE.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.053
AND THE TWO OF US SPENT
SO MANY YEARS BEING MISERABLE.

39:45.053 --> 39:47.055
I JUST THINK AT OUR AGE,

39:47.055 --> 39:51.089
WE CAN'T LET AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR HAPPINESS PASS US BY.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.700
FORGET THE RED.

40:01.700 --> 40:04.402
I'VE GOT SOMETHING HERE
CALLED MOONSTRUCK YELLOW

40:04.402 --> 40:08.406
THAT WILL KICK
YOUR DINING ROOM'S ASS.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.408
COME ON. I PROMISE.
YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

40:10.408 --> 40:14.182
WITH YOUR RED HAIR, YOU WILL
LOOK SO HOT IN THIS ROOM.

40:14.182 --> 40:16.545
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

40:16.545 --> 40:19.718
CLEARLY YOU HAVE
OTHER OPTIONS.

40:21.890 --> 40:23.722
MAYBE I DO.

40:25.554 --> 40:26.725
(squeaks)

40:30.428 --> 40:33.502
THERE'S MY FAVORITE REALTOR.
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

40:33.502 --> 40:35.003
HOW ARE YA?

40:35.003 --> 40:37.005
BIT OF A PARIAH,
THANKS TO YOU.

40:37.005 --> 40:40.168
DON'T TELL ME THE NEIGHBORS
ARE BLAMING YOU FOR MY RETURN.

40:40.168 --> 40:42.440
OF COURSE THEY ARE.
 (chuckles)

40:42.440 --> 40:45.213
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PETS,

40:45.213 --> 40:46.875
YOU COULD HAVE MENTIONED

40:46.875 --> 40:49.618
IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T
ALLOW THEM IN PRISON.
 NOW, NOW, BE NICE.

40:49.618 --> 40:51.620
I'M ABOUT TO THROW
MORE BUSINESS YOUR WAY.
 OH?

40:51.620 --> 40:54.452
I HEAR THAT MY OLD HOUSE
IS BACK ON THE MARKET.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.154
I'D LIKE TO BUY IT.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.156
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE WONDERFUL MEMORIES?

40:58.156 --> 41:00.158
JUST FIND OUT WHAT
THEY'RE ASKING.

41:00.158 --> 41:03.161
OKAY, BUT YOU JUST SIGNED
A ONE-YEAR LEASE ON THIS PLACE,

41:03.161 --> 41:05.163
AND YOU'RE BUYING A HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.165
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
A VERY GOOD PLAN.

41:07.165 --> 41:11.169
OH, BELIEVE ME. I'VE HAD
TEN YEARS TO WORK ON THIS PLAN.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.071
IT'S A GOOD ONE.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.604
BAD NEWS TRAVELS QUICKLY,

41:15.604 --> 41:20.509
AND WHEN IT ARRIVES, WE HAVE
TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.

41:23.211 --> 41:27.255
IF OUR HUSBANDS TELL US
THEY'VE MOVED ON...

41:27.255 --> 41:31.720
WE LOOK FOR PROJECTS
TO DISTRACT US.

41:31.720 --> 41:35.894
IF THE BILLS START
TO STACK UP...

41:35.894 --> 41:40.228
WE FIND WAYS TO EARN
EXTRA CASH.

41:40.228 --> 41:45.534
IF WE'RE TOLD A SECRET
TOO TERRIBLE TO SHARE...

41:45.534 --> 41:50.238
WE LEARN TO KEEP IT
TO OURSELVES.

41:50.238 --> 41:55.213
BUT WE MUST REMEMBER
THE BAD NEWS THAT'S DELIVERED

41:55.213 --> 41:58.917
CAN SOMETIMES BE GOOD NEWS...

41:58.917 --> 42:01.049
IN DISGUISE.

42:01.049 --> 42:03.521
THAT THE GUY
YOU WERE TALKIN' ABOUT?

42:04.893 --> 42:06.895
THE ONE THAT KILLED
YOUR SISTER?

42:06.895 --> 42:09.598
IT CERTAINLY IS.

42:09.598 --> 42:13.602
HE LOOKS LIKE A KILLER.
IT'S A SHAME THEY LET HIM OUT.

42:13.602 --> 42:17.265
AS IT TURNS OUT,
IT'S ALL FOR THE BEST.

42:17.265 --> 42:21.239
PAUL CAN NOW RECEIVE
THE PUNISHMENT HE'S ENTITLED TO.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.612
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

42:23.612 --> 42:25.744
JUST BETWEEN US GIRLS,

42:25.744 --> 42:29.147
PAUL YOUNG WILL BE DEAD
WITHIN SIX MONTHS.

42:29.147 --> 42:31.149
HOW YOU GONNA
MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

42:31.149 --> 42:33.622
YOU'RE IN HERE
AT LEAST TWO YEARS.

42:33.622 --> 42:38.587
TRUE, BUT YOU SEE,

42:38.587 --> 42:41.760
PAUL YOUNG DOESN'T HAVE
A FRIENDS ON THAT STREET.

42:44.092 --> 42:46.234
I DO.

42:46.234 --> 42:48.336
(chuckles)
