WEBVTT

00:28.829 --> 00:30.429
I meant to get a haircut.

00:35.737 --> 00:38.104
I got a present for ya', Casey.

00:46.112 --> 00:47.481
<i>Casey, sweetie,</i>

00:47.515 --> 00:48.835
<i>you take your
daddy's present now.</i>

00:51.250 --> 00:52.654
Whoa.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.762
<i>I got a picture of you, too.</i>

01:08.536 --> 01:10.069
Maria!

01:11.305 --> 01:13.406
No! No, no! No!

01:13.439 --> 01:15.141
<i>Happy birthday, darlin'.</i>

01:27.387 --> 01:28.421
No!

01:44.771 --> 01:47.709
Whoa!

02:05.859 --> 02:07.861
Thank you.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.305
<i>Obviously, you've seen
mankiewicz's</i> house of strangers.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.740
It's one of my all-time
favorite movies.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.604
That's exactly what your
script reminded me of.

02:12.634 --> 02:13.768
The power struggle,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.502
the fight for
relevance. Yeah. Yeah.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.212
And you're gonna think
this sounds a little crazy,

02:17.236 --> 02:19.338
but in some ways,
it's <i>king lear.</i>

02:19.372 --> 02:20.608
It's <i>king lear.</i> Yeah, exactly.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.241
See, I knew you'd understand

02:22.275 --> 02:23.419
what I'm trying
to do with this film.

02:23.443 --> 02:24.912
Right.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.447
David, I don't know
what to say exactly,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.316
except this is the
role of a lifetime

02:29.348 --> 02:31.718
and I'd really love
to be a part of this.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.530
Cool, man. I'll just give you
a shout in a couple of days.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.689
Oh. If you're worried
about the Boston accent,

02:35.723 --> 02:37.223
I can do the Boston accent.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.468
I've been working
on it all week.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.894
I'm not worried, Nick.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.471
Okay, well, if you have
any other questions

02:41.495 --> 02:43.730
or you just wanna
talk, give me a call.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.968
Or if you'd like me
to, uh... to read...

02:47.001 --> 02:48.367
You don't need to read for me.

02:48.401 --> 02:50.302
Of course not.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.739
And obviously, I'm not going to.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.608
Obviously.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.351
But I bet a part of you would
love to hear me read, right?

02:55.375 --> 02:56.475
I mean, why wouldn't you?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.211
If I were you, i'd
want to hear it.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.885
Seriously, I don't
want you to read. Okay.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.649
Anyway, this is
me, so I'm gonna...

03:01.682 --> 03:04.350
Well, you know
what? I'm gonna read.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.687
"It's a foregone
conclusion, Jimmy."

03:06.721 --> 03:08.990
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

03:09.022 --> 03:10.824
"to send a message to the body."

03:10.858 --> 03:13.661
"So, by the time your bullets
hit me, my cerebral cortex"

03:13.694 --> 03:14.872
"will have transmitted a signal"

03:14.896 --> 03:16.329
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

03:16.362 --> 03:18.699
"that operate
my trigger finger."

03:18.733 --> 03:22.002
"And before your asshole
has had a chance to pucker up,"

03:22.036 --> 03:23.905
"your medulla oblongata"

03:23.937 --> 03:26.873
"will be splattered on a
fucking wall behind ya."

03:26.908 --> 03:28.776
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

03:28.810 --> 03:30.578
"on this beautiful green earth,"

03:30.610 --> 03:34.981
"well, then, ha, I say, ha,
what a way to fucking go."

03:37.685 --> 03:39.252
Holy shit.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.558
I can do another if you want.

03:49.361 --> 03:52.432
Damn, man!

03:52.466 --> 03:54.668
That was good, right? Felt good.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.270
Mankiewicz?
Whoo-hoo! Incredible pull.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.338
I know. It just
popped into my head.

03:59.372 --> 04:01.307
Well, good. I'm happy for you.

04:01.341 --> 04:05.412
Because, honestly,
man, you really need this.

04:05.444 --> 04:07.379
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

04:07.413 --> 04:09.884
You get it. This could
be a game changer.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.929
I don't need a game changer.
If it happens, it happens.

04:11.953 --> 04:13.697
If it doesn't, I'll just keep
working. That's what I do.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.690
I'm just saying, you could
be a little more strategic.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.492
Make more movie star choices.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.459
It's like miles Davis told me...

04:20.494 --> 04:21.538
"Sometimes, it's the notes"

04:21.562 --> 04:22.764
"you don't play."

04:22.797 --> 04:24.331
Miles Davis was a heroin addict.

04:24.363 --> 04:25.608
I mean, I love him,
he was a maestro,

04:25.632 --> 04:27.033
but I'm happy,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.478
I'm healthy when i'm
working. I'm an actor.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.937
No, you're a fucking movie star!

04:29.971 --> 04:31.403
And don't you ever forget that!

04:31.437 --> 04:33.016
Okay, I don't need
this. I don't need this.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.975
Get out of my car.
Nicky, get out of my car.

04:35.009 --> 04:36.644
I don't need this.

04:45.351 --> 04:47.353
I need this.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.355
This could be a game changer.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.067
So, you're not happy with
how your career is going

04:51.091 --> 04:53.728
because you seem to
be working all the time.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.430
Well, I never viewed it
as a career, only as work.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.509
And what's wrong with that?

04:58.533 --> 05:00.100
I mean, in any other job,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.601
hard work is
something to behold,

05:01.636 --> 05:03.004
but with film performance,

05:03.036 --> 05:04.447
"you're making too
many movies, Nick."

05:04.471 --> 05:05.807
"You're working too hard, Nick."

05:05.839 --> 05:07.350
"Have the audience
miss you more, Nick."

05:07.374 --> 05:08.608
I mean, "hello, it's my job."

05:08.643 --> 05:09.911
"I pay my bills."

05:09.944 --> 05:11.612
"I feed my family.
You're annoying."

05:11.646 --> 05:12.913
My gosh!

05:13.915 --> 05:15.783
Yeah.

05:15.817 --> 05:17.584
So, what's the worry here, Nick?

05:17.617 --> 05:19.451
You've lost some
of your ability,

05:19.485 --> 05:21.420
your talent as an actor?

05:22.589 --> 05:23.591
No.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.492
Uh...

05:25.526 --> 05:27.394
No, it's just that
I really want this.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.728
This is the role of a lifetime.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.665
It's a great part.

05:30.697 --> 05:33.567
Well, how do you think your
relationship with your work

05:33.600 --> 05:35.970
affects your relationship
with your daughter?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.004
Let's bring addy
into this, shall we?

05:39.906 --> 05:42.143
What? Oh, you
don't have to do that.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.610
You guys can keep talking.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.946
Well, I'll just finish with,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.454
a role like this doesn't
come along every day.

05:46.478 --> 05:47.648
And now, I'm gonna zip it.

05:47.682 --> 05:48.792
- I zipped it good.
- Addy.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.951
How do you think
your dad's anxiety

05:50.985 --> 05:52.653
over his career
has affected you?

05:52.687 --> 05:54.154
Well, his career is pretty much

05:54.187 --> 05:55.723
the only thing we talk about.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.591
That or he makes
me watch old movies,

05:57.625 --> 05:59.159
and then discuss them.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.728
Which is really just him
lecturing me for two hours.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.497
It's a conversation. It's
more of a conversation.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.466
He made me watch
this bizarre old movie.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.137
What was it called? The
island of Dr. Calamari?

06:10.170 --> 06:13.139
<i>The cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>
And did you like it, addy?

06:13.173 --> 06:15.475
It's one of my favorite
films. Have you seen it?

06:15.509 --> 06:16.677
No, I have not.

06:16.711 --> 06:19.146
It's about this
insane old doctor

06:19.180 --> 06:22.415
who has a sleepwalker
completely under his spell.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.785
This crazy old loon.

06:24.819 --> 06:28.723
Can you imagine how
horrifying that would be?

06:28.755 --> 06:29.932
To be completely
under someone's spell?

06:29.956 --> 06:31.826
And you liked it, right?

06:31.858 --> 06:33.637
I mean, you like the painted
sets, and the makeup...

06:33.661 --> 06:34.928
No, I did not.

06:34.961 --> 06:36.129
Sounds to me like

06:36.163 --> 06:38.098
maybe she didn't
want to see the movie.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.533
Did you think about that, Nick?

06:39.567 --> 06:40.901
About what she wants?

06:40.935 --> 06:42.870
Cheryl, come on. Is
that a real question?

06:42.903 --> 06:45.038
What do you think
he's gonna say?

06:45.072 --> 06:48.942
She has an amazing visual
sensibility. Always has.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.620
We're very close, and
within that closeness,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.545
I was able to ascertain...

06:57.151 --> 06:58.185
Hey, honey. Hi, mom.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.521
Bye, addy. I love you.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.225
Oh, no, what happened?

07:04.257 --> 07:06.226
Oh, she's mad at me
because we watched.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.762
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i>
together and she hated it,

07:08.795 --> 07:11.731
which I find odd, given how
mature her taste normally is.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.533
Wait, you're surprised
your teenage daughter

07:13.567 --> 07:15.735
didn't wanna watch an insane

07:15.769 --> 07:17.605
100-year-old
German film with you?

07:17.637 --> 07:19.673
Yes. Oh, my god. Okay.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.042
Well, it's not just that.

07:21.074 --> 07:22.519
You know, she's never
read Mary shelley,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.678
or Jane Austen, or even twain.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.814
What a little philistine.
Should we disown her?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.951
She thought Humphrey
bogart was a porn star.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.252
Yeah...

07:31.285 --> 07:33.788
What, really? Yeah.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.990
That's disappointing.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.591
Unless there is a porn star
called Humphrey bogart.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.860
That would work, wouldn't
it? Humphrey. Hump.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.531
No?

07:43.564 --> 07:45.031
Look, you're just...

07:45.066 --> 07:46.933
You're at a tricky
stage right now

07:46.968 --> 07:48.235
with her, okay?

07:48.269 --> 07:49.704
And if you don't
learn to connect,

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
it's gonna stay broken for...

07:51.004 --> 07:53.139
What the fuck are
you smiling at? Huh?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.542
Why are you smiling? I'm not.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.909
You are. Okay.

07:55.942 --> 07:56.987
Olivia, I'm up for a
very exciting movie.

07:57.011 --> 07:58.778
And I think it's gonna happen.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.257
Oh, my god. Look, will
you do me a favor? Yes.

08:00.281 --> 08:01.749
Turn up for her birthday party.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.550
Of course. Of course.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.918
Gosh!

08:04.951 --> 08:07.088
Hey, fink, let's meet up.
I have some questions.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.956
I don't know. I just
really want this.

08:08.990 --> 08:11.692
I mean, this is the role of a
lifetime, and as my agent...

08:11.725 --> 08:15.028
Nick, I've got a
good feeling, okay?

08:15.062 --> 08:16.863
Okay. Now, come on.

08:16.896 --> 08:18.899
I know how tense you get.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.101
This is going to help you relax.

08:21.836 --> 08:23.069
Fuck!

08:23.103 --> 08:25.139
Oh, my! Fuck, I
love this so much.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.310
Is this supposed to
hurt this much? Fuck!

08:29.343 --> 08:31.245
It is. The more pain the better.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.846
Fuckin'...

08:32.879 --> 08:35.316
Why? It's good for circulation.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.826
So, Nick, we got another offer.

08:45.860 --> 08:46.900
Just came in this morning.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.763
Excellent. What's it about?

08:48.796 --> 08:51.197
It's about a million bucks.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.768
What is it?

08:53.801 --> 08:55.201
A birthday party, fink?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.104
What are you even talking about?

08:57.138 --> 08:58.605
You go, and I don't know,

08:58.639 --> 08:59.916
tell some stories,
make 'em laugh.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.043
Make 'em laugh? Like...
Like a circus clown?

09:02.076 --> 09:03.576
A trained seal?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.183
Nick, I got a call from your
business manager, Kenny.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.328
You've been living at the
sunset tower for over a year.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.855
And so? They love
having me there.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.625
You owe them $600,000.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.125
They sent the bills to Kenny.

09:20.161 --> 09:21.761
I'll take care of it.

09:21.796 --> 09:24.065
Kenny says you still
have substantial debts.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.801
And now, the divorce,
and your spending habits

09:26.833 --> 09:28.869
and, and, and...
Okay, I'm gonna deal

09:28.903 --> 09:30.671
with all that, fink.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.972
You know I will.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.109
But I'm gonna get this next role

09:35.142 --> 09:38.144
and when I do,
all of that changes.

09:38.913 --> 09:41.315
Then, I'm back.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.618
And, by the way, not
that I went anywhere.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.153
Not that you went anywhere.

09:46.187 --> 09:47.620
You never shit on yourself.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.323
Come on! Never shit on yourself.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.740
Fink, hold on a second.
Let me get somewhere quiet.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.376
Fink, you still there?
I can hear you now.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.154
Did you talk to him?
<i>I talked to David.</i>

10:12.178 --> 10:14.280
Oh, you're here. Great. Hold on.

10:14.315 --> 10:15.883
Right, we're doing cake.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.650
Uh... oh, my
god, you're doing...

10:17.684 --> 10:18.885
I have to finish this call.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.788
Oh, my god! Jesus Christ!

10:21.822 --> 10:22.856
Come on!

10:22.889 --> 10:25.658
Fink, did you talk to him?

10:25.692 --> 10:26.961
<i>Nick, can you hear me?</i>

10:26.994 --> 10:29.697
Yes, I can hear you.
What did he say?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.365
<i>He said he loves you,</i>

10:31.398 --> 10:33.868
<i>but he ultimately went
in a different direction</i>

10:33.900 --> 10:35.369
<i>for the role.</i>

10:35.402 --> 10:36.836
<i>Sorry, dude.</i>

10:58.192 --> 10:59.692
I hate it.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.830
Thank you, mom.

11:07.801 --> 11:08.836
Thank you.

11:12.907 --> 11:14.008
Thank you.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.010
Blow, blow. Make a wish.

11:19.245 --> 11:22.216
Happy birthday, addy!
All right, everybody!

11:22.249 --> 11:26.086
Gather round the piano.
It's showtime, folks.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.297
- What's he doing?
- What?

11:27.321 --> 11:28.923
Nick? Nick?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.691
Uh, step away
from the piano, Nick.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.226
Hi, Lewis.

11:33.259 --> 11:35.261
You're all grown up now.

11:35.296 --> 11:37.096
What, are you...
What, are you 15?

11:37.130 --> 11:38.164
Dad, don't talk to Lewis.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.767
Okay.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.769
When she was nine years old,

11:41.802 --> 11:45.038
my daughter and I took
our first trip together.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.207
We drove overnight,

11:47.240 --> 11:49.943
across the desert,
to the Grand Canyon.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.278
You remember that, sweetheart?

11:51.312 --> 11:52.947
I do remember that.

11:52.980 --> 11:56.149
And when the sun came up,

11:56.182 --> 11:57.784
I pulled over to
the side of the road

11:57.817 --> 12:01.322
as she rested her little
head on my shoulder

12:01.355 --> 12:03.123
and we just watched...

12:05.392 --> 12:07.027
Watched the sun come up.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.899
That was the happiest
moment of my life.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.235
And in that moment,

12:14.268 --> 12:17.337
I composed a little tune
for her 16th birthday.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.807
I've been working
on it ever since.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.077
And, uh, happy birthday,
sweetheart. Here goes.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.231
Oh, fucking Jesus!

12:45.265 --> 12:48.101
I'm so excited to see what
you do with your life, honey.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.538
And I'll support
whatever you choose.

12:50.572 --> 12:53.807
Only, I wouldn't
recommend a life in the arts.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.844
Especially, with how real
talent goes unappreciated

12:56.876 --> 12:58.513
in this shithole town.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
I don't know, Olivia.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.126
I don't know.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.205
Do you remember
when the three of us

13:25.239 --> 13:27.041
used to lie on the
living room floor

13:27.073 --> 13:28.610
in the New York apartment,

13:28.643 --> 13:31.345
and you and I would
watch her for hours on end?

13:31.378 --> 13:32.879
Remember?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.883
It was so much easier then.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.017
Yeah.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.894
Listen.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.096
I'm gonna say something,
and I'm not sure I should.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.397
Say it.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.433
Okay.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.967
I need you.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.403
You need me?

13:56.437 --> 13:59.940
I need you to get
your shit together, Nick.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.176
Okay? She's not two
years old anymore.

14:02.208 --> 14:05.245
She is a smart girl
who needs her dad.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.346
She doesn't need...

14:07.980 --> 14:09.283
She doesn't need this guy.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.427
Yeah.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.561
No, no. Come on.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.283
<i>Nick.</i> fink.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.985
The majorca thing...

15:18.018 --> 15:19.653
<i>What? The birthday
party? So depressing.</i>

15:19.687 --> 15:22.221
<i>I am honestly sorry
for even bringing it up.</i>

15:22.255 --> 15:23.322
I'll take it.

15:23.356 --> 15:24.591
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

15:24.625 --> 15:27.193
It better be because

15:27.226 --> 15:30.496
when it's over, I'm done.

15:30.532 --> 15:33.200
Like hot dogs on a grill.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.469
I'm quitting acting.

15:35.503 --> 15:39.206
So, you can call the
trades, and tell them I said

15:39.239 --> 15:42.442
it was a tremendous...

15:43.644 --> 15:45.513
Honor...

15:46.614 --> 15:50.283
To be a small part

15:50.317 --> 15:53.654
of one of the oldest
of human traditions,

15:55.389 --> 16:00.293
storytelling and mythmaking.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.596
<i>Ah, fuck, man, I'm sorry.</i>

16:01.629 --> 16:03.339
<i>I'm driving through the
hills. One more time.</i>

16:03.363 --> 16:05.499
I said I'm quitting...

16:08.469 --> 16:10.336
<i>Back to our main news story</i>

16:10.370 --> 16:12.172
<i>as catalan's
presidential candidate.</i>

16:12.206 --> 16:13.373
<i>Charles delgado's daughter</i>

16:13.407 --> 16:15.341
<i>was kidnapped on Monday.</i>

16:15.375 --> 16:17.153
<i>The police have confirmed
that they have no information</i>

16:17.177 --> 16:18.412
<i>as to her whereabouts.</i>

16:18.445 --> 16:19.722
<i>They have asked
anyone with any...</i>

16:19.746 --> 16:21.280
<i>What do you say</i>

16:21.315 --> 16:23.283
<i>we cut the chitchat, a-hole?</i>

16:23.317 --> 16:24.751
<i>You almost got me killed twice.</i>

16:24.786 --> 16:26.754
Okay.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.677
I'm in position.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.379
<i>All right, as
soon as I have eyes</i>

16:52.412 --> 16:53.691
<i>on baldassari, you
move in and take him.</i>

16:53.715 --> 16:54.716
Copy that.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.687
Wait, wait, wait.
It's not baldassari.

17:00.721 --> 17:02.422
What the fuck is
happening right now?

17:02.456 --> 17:05.392
Martin, talk to me.
Who's on the plane?

17:05.424 --> 17:08.428
I don't know if
I'm losing my goddamn mind,

17:08.461 --> 17:11.329
but I'm pretty sure that's
the actor Nick cage.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.098
That motherfucker
from <i>moonstruck?</i>

17:13.133 --> 17:14.701
<i>Moonstruck?</i> no. From <i>face/off.</i>

17:14.736 --> 17:16.502
Wait, wait, wait.

17:16.538 --> 17:19.070
Why the fuck is Nick
cage on this plane?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.742
You know what?
We're pulling out.

17:22.777 --> 17:23.820
<i>I don't like this.
Get out of there.</i>

17:23.845 --> 17:25.278
Martin.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.579
<i>No, get out of there. Now.</i>

17:30.116 --> 17:33.252
<i>Vivian, do you copy?
I said, do you copy?</i>

17:33.287 --> 17:34.354
You know what?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.423
No.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.501
What do you mean,
no? No, no, no.

17:37.525 --> 17:39.365
What are you doing?
Vivian, what are you doing?

17:39.527 --> 17:41.695
Thank you.

17:41.729 --> 17:44.463
This is our shot. <i>No, get out.</i>

17:44.498 --> 17:46.365
Vivian, get the fuck
out of there right...

17:46.400 --> 17:50.837
Nicolas cage! Oh, my god!
You're so fucking awesome!

17:50.872 --> 17:52.707
I love you! Oh, thank you.

17:52.740 --> 17:56.375
Oh, me and my nephew
Raymond just watched <i>croods 2.</i>

17:56.410 --> 17:59.278
<i>Dude! Cracked us up.</i>

17:59.313 --> 18:00.815
Can I get a selfie? Sure.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.325
Oh, shit. Oh, my god.
No, I like that movie, too.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.393
You did so good
in that movie, man.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.652
Thank you. My goodness.

18:04.685 --> 18:06.118
I made that movie
with Emma stone.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.555
You did? She's
one of my favorites.

18:07.588 --> 18:08.766
But you were the best.
Well, thank you.

18:08.789 --> 18:10.222
We look good.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.301
Well, say hi to
your nephew for me.

18:11.325 --> 18:12.626
Okay. Yeah. Raymond. Okay.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.561
Thank you. All right, bye.

18:16.395 --> 18:17.898
Dropped that GPS on him.

18:17.932 --> 18:20.400
Are you out of your mind?
He's a fucking civilian.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.803
<i>He's an actor.</i>

18:21.836 --> 18:23.379
Do you remember what
went down in Lisbon?

18:23.403 --> 18:24.739
Fuck Lisbon, man!

18:25.707 --> 18:27.374
That was kind of loud.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.844
But fuck Lisbon.
That wasn't my fault.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.345
And by the way,

18:31.377 --> 18:32.547
have you seen <i>croods 2? No.</i>

18:32.579 --> 18:34.146
I'm 44 years old.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.782
Why the fuck would
I see <i>croods 2?</i>

18:35.817 --> 18:36.884
I'm picking you up.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.635
Yeah, fink, can you hold on?

18:54.669 --> 18:56.580
Excuse me, it's Los Angeles
calling. I need to take this.

18:56.604 --> 18:58.238
Just two minutes. Of course.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.307
Can you hold one second?
I'm getting on a boat.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.342
Thank you. Yeah.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.345
I mean, what do we know
about this guy anyway?

19:05.378 --> 19:10.282
Is he a Spanish Dr. No? Is
he into something strange?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.694
<i>Allan did some
research. Hold on.</i>

19:11.719 --> 19:13.286
<i>Allan, what does this guy do?</i>

19:13.319 --> 19:14.888
<i>He owns olive groves apparently.</i>

19:14.922 --> 19:16.824
Also, he wrote this screenplay,

19:16.857 --> 19:18.726
and he wants Nick to star in it.

19:18.759 --> 19:20.394
Throw that in the fucking trash.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.796
<i>Nick, you're fine.</i>

19:21.828 --> 19:23.507
It's not like he's gonna
want you to suck his dick

19:23.530 --> 19:24.665
or fuck his wife,

19:24.699 --> 19:25.876
or watch you watch
him fuck his wife.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.734
I wouldn't think so. <i>Relax.</i>

19:27.769 --> 19:29.537
<i>Have fun and give me
a call when it's done.</i>

19:29.569 --> 19:30.730
You can tell me all about it.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.346
Nice place.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.415
Maybe I ought to get
into the olive business.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.451
Mr. Cage, I... yeah,
excuse me. Real quick.

19:44.483 --> 19:45.796
The guy that owns this
house, what's his name?

19:45.819 --> 19:48.221
Javi. Yeah, Javi.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.958
Is Javi going to want
me to, uh, you know...

19:52.325 --> 19:53.894
I'm not sure I understand.

19:53.927 --> 19:55.639
Look, if Javi wants me to
suck his dick, or fuck his wife,

19:55.663 --> 19:57.364
or watch me watch
him fuck his wife,

19:57.396 --> 19:58.809
that's a no-go. You
understand? It's <i>no bueno.</i>

19:58.833 --> 20:00.667
I think so. Okay, and if Javi...

20:00.701 --> 20:01.769
I am Javi.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.711
Nick cage.

20:12.913 --> 20:15.516
So, how was it?

20:15.549 --> 20:18.484
It was fine,
normal. No big deal.

20:18.519 --> 20:20.654
Come on. Tell me
the truth. Okay, okay.

20:20.688 --> 20:22.589
He was incredible. Was he?

20:22.623 --> 20:23.990
But also, like, super cool.

20:24.025 --> 20:25.792
He was a little taller
than I had imagined

20:25.826 --> 20:27.705
because you know they
say actors are pretty short.

20:27.729 --> 20:28.762
So, was he short?

20:28.796 --> 20:29.931
No. No?

20:29.963 --> 20:30.964
He was...

20:32.432 --> 20:33.968
Just right.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.040
Okay, but did he say anything
about your screenplay?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.881
No. He didn't bring it
up, I didn't bring it up.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.272
It wasn't the right time.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.642
Just think about
how would it feel

20:41.675 --> 20:43.611
to say in front of
everyone at the party

20:43.644 --> 20:47.781
that Nicolas cage is starring
in a movie that you wrote.

20:47.815 --> 20:48.982
I don't know, Gabriela,

20:49.016 --> 20:50.456
maybe I am living
in a fantasy world.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.417
I mean, look who
we're talking about here.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.653
The man is a legend!

21:03.029 --> 21:04.030
Hi.

21:07.535 --> 21:08.536
Hey.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.044
Cheers.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.488
Huh?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.423
What?

21:30.457 --> 21:31.568
Oh, no, I'm sorry,
I thought that...

21:31.592 --> 21:32.392
Did you say... no, I did...

21:32.424 --> 21:33.994
Oh, never mind.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.510
Yeah, so along those same
lines, I was wondering...

21:39.534 --> 21:40.644
And it's totally
okay if you haven't,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.036
but I was just wondering

21:42.068 --> 21:43.580
if you had a chance
to read my screenplay?

21:43.604 --> 21:45.006
Javi!

21:45.038 --> 21:49.576
Can I come or it's only for vip?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.378
Uh, Mr. Cage, this is
Ms. Gabriela lucchesi. Hi.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.949
She runs all of our
agricultural operations.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.983
And this is my cousin.

21:57.018 --> 21:58.819
Lucas Gutierrez.

21:58.853 --> 22:02.623
Mr. Cage, we obviously are
very excited to have you here.

22:02.656 --> 22:03.891
What are you working on next?

22:03.924 --> 22:06.059
Well, that's a tough question

22:06.093 --> 22:08.428
for an actor to
get, but it's fine.

22:08.461 --> 22:11.431
Oh. 'Cause
I'm no longer an actor.

22:11.463 --> 22:12.799
I've retired.

22:12.834 --> 22:15.936
What? What do you mean, retired?

22:15.970 --> 22:18.673
So, what are you
going to do now?

22:20.775 --> 22:22.943
Live the life of a house cat.

22:22.977 --> 22:25.145
Because it's just
a matter of time

22:25.179 --> 22:28.682
before the great power plant
upstairs turns off the juice

22:28.715 --> 22:32.019
and we retreat to the
black pit of nothingness

22:32.052 --> 22:33.621
from whence we came.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.693
So, tell us about
making <i>the rock.</i>

22:41.127 --> 22:42.963
Bet you wish you
were still making movies

22:42.997 --> 22:44.965
like that, huh, Mr. Cage?

22:47.034 --> 22:49.569
Must have been nice
to have been a star.

22:50.637 --> 22:51.672
And now...

23:17.798 --> 23:19.666
Mr. Cage? Wake up.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.134
Jesus Christ!

23:21.167 --> 23:23.738
So, Mr. Gutierrez has been

23:23.770 --> 23:25.471
waiting all day
for you to get up.

23:25.506 --> 23:26.840
He really wants to show you

23:26.874 --> 23:28.218
one of his favorite
places of all Spain.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.211
It's called the cliffs
of cap de formentor.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.646
Yeah, see, well,
I'm very jet lagged,

23:32.680 --> 23:35.548
so I won't be
attending that, okay?

23:35.583 --> 23:36.616
Thank you.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.588
Oh, my god! Mr. Cage.

23:41.622 --> 23:43.557
If Mr. Gutierrez is asking you

23:43.590 --> 23:44.991
to go with him
and see the cliffs,

23:45.026 --> 23:46.637
you're gonna go with
him and see the cliffs.

23:46.661 --> 23:47.994
And you're gonna
love the cliffs.

23:48.028 --> 23:49.563
Even if you hate the cliffs!

23:50.230 --> 23:51.632
Are we clear?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.569
Gabriela said you are
really excited about the cliffs.

23:56.604 --> 24:00.607
Yeah, very much so. It's just...

24:00.641 --> 24:02.943
I'm not feeling
tip-top right now,

24:02.977 --> 24:04.744
so if you wanna
go out there alone,

24:04.778 --> 24:07.515
I could go back to
the room... oh, shit!

24:07.548 --> 24:08.982
Shit! What?

24:12.019 --> 24:14.154
We must go now.

24:14.188 --> 24:15.623
Hey!

24:17.258 --> 24:18.458
Javi!

24:21.761 --> 24:22.930
Javi!

24:22.963 --> 24:24.531
What is going on?

24:24.565 --> 24:25.700
Faster!

24:25.732 --> 24:27.535
What are we running from?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.836
The general!

24:30.037 --> 24:31.605
Javi!

24:33.641 --> 24:35.241
Hey!

24:35.276 --> 24:37.020
You need to tell me right
now what the hell is going on,

24:37.044 --> 24:38.278
or I'm getting my shit,

24:38.311 --> 24:39.623
and I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.647
The general!

24:42.148 --> 24:45.086
The general forbade me
to see his daughter Matilda.

24:46.287 --> 24:48.788
But we defied his orders!

24:48.823 --> 24:52.993
And now, he
wants to end my life.

24:53.027 --> 24:54.528
Can't you see him?

25:00.067 --> 25:02.036
All right, all right, I get it.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.237
You're making this up?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.805
What is this?

25:04.838 --> 25:08.108
Like a little stanislavski
improv thing?

25:08.142 --> 25:09.609
Well, you can stop.

25:09.643 --> 25:11.578
Stanislavski? Is he
part of the resistance?

25:11.612 --> 25:14.647
Stop! I am your guest!

25:14.682 --> 25:17.084
Gabriela ripped the
bedspread off me this morning.

25:17.117 --> 25:20.121
Now you're sending me
on, like, a wild goose chase!

25:20.153 --> 25:22.655
I'm sorry, but you can't
quit acting! You can't!

25:22.690 --> 25:24.191
That's none of your business.

25:24.224 --> 25:27.595
Whether you like it
or not, you have a gift.

25:27.627 --> 25:32.098
And that gift brings light
and joy to an increasingly

25:33.134 --> 25:35.869
dark and broken world!

25:35.903 --> 25:39.339
And to turn your
back on that gift

25:39.373 --> 25:43.576
is to turn your back on
the entire human race.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.079
The human race?

25:46.113 --> 25:48.182
I'm afraid so.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.151
What am I gonna do?

25:50.183 --> 25:51.652
Oh, wow. If we don't go now,

25:51.684 --> 25:54.121
they will fucking kill us!

25:54.154 --> 25:55.655
These people smell blood

25:55.689 --> 25:56.900
and they come running.
What am I gonna do?

25:56.923 --> 25:58.368
They're almost to
the edge of the forest.

25:58.392 --> 25:59.859
I can hear them.

25:59.894 --> 26:01.828
And Matilda, she is
waiting down the coast.

26:01.862 --> 26:04.565
We have to go now!
We have to jump!

26:13.106 --> 26:15.976
You're in an
untenable situation.

26:16.009 --> 26:17.077
You know that, right?

26:18.813 --> 26:20.114
So tell me one thing.

26:21.816 --> 26:23.317
Do you love her?

26:23.349 --> 26:25.385
I've always loved her.

26:25.419 --> 26:29.690
Then let's get you
out of here alive.

26:36.830 --> 26:39.365
Oh, shit!

26:43.269 --> 26:45.338
Fuck!

26:45.372 --> 26:46.773
Oh, god!

26:46.807 --> 26:48.085
I didn't know there was a cliff!

26:48.108 --> 26:49.809
I didn't know it was that high!

26:49.844 --> 26:51.077
We could have died!

26:54.013 --> 26:55.148
You're a wild man.

26:57.817 --> 26:59.097
I prefer bourbon, but thank you.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.624
God, this place is stunning.

27:04.892 --> 27:06.359
I bet my daughter

27:06.393 --> 27:08.328
would like it out here.
It'd be good for her.

27:08.362 --> 27:09.997
Are you two close?

27:10.029 --> 27:13.067
Well, it's impossible to
be close with a 16-year-old.

27:13.099 --> 27:15.301
But I've tried to be
there for her. It's just...

27:15.336 --> 27:17.770
There's no script for parenting.

27:17.805 --> 27:20.740
Thank god for my ex, Olivia.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.276
How did you meet Olivia?

27:22.308 --> 27:25.679
She was a make-up artist
on <i>captain corelli's mandolin.</i>

27:25.712 --> 27:27.147
Beautiful film. Thank you.

27:27.181 --> 27:28.982
Underrated for sure.

27:29.016 --> 27:30.183
We just hit it off, you know.

27:30.217 --> 27:32.819
She was funny, smart, beautiful.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.087
So, what happened?

27:36.022 --> 27:37.057
What happened?

27:41.194 --> 27:44.030
What about you? Ever
been married? Kids?

27:44.064 --> 27:45.065
No.

27:46.767 --> 27:49.670
There is one woman, but, uh,

27:51.471 --> 27:55.476
sometimes circumstances
get in the way of love

27:55.509 --> 27:57.243
and that's just the way it is.

28:01.347 --> 28:05.185
Anyway, Mr. Cage,

28:05.219 --> 28:07.054
what is your favorite movie?

28:07.086 --> 28:10.490
Oh... favorite movie?

28:10.525 --> 28:15.429
Oh, wow! I mean,
that... that is, uh...

28:15.461 --> 28:18.898
That's one of those questions
that's impossible to answer.

28:18.932 --> 28:23.336
Because, you see,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.205
You can't just limit it to one.

28:25.239 --> 28:28.308
It depends upon your
mood, the seasons.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.911
All right, let's do
top three. You start.

28:30.944 --> 28:33.012
Number one, <i>face/off.</i>

28:33.047 --> 28:34.181
Oh, thank you.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.483
Woo is a maestro. Thank you.

28:39.153 --> 28:40.887
Number two, let me think...

28:41.989 --> 28:43.824
<i>The cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</i>

28:43.856 --> 28:46.192
You love
<i>caligari?</i> I love <i>caligari.</i>

28:46.227 --> 28:49.496
Wow! I was beginning to
think I was the only one.

28:49.530 --> 28:51.397
You gonna run
the table here, jav?

28:51.432 --> 28:55.836
It's hard. It's like you said,
100-plus years of rich cinema.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.905
Thank you.

28:58.939 --> 29:01.375
Look, can you just stop stalling

29:01.407 --> 29:03.042
and answer the question?

29:03.076 --> 29:05.144
What is your third
favorite movie of all time?

29:09.482 --> 29:10.518
<i>Paddington 2.</i>

29:10.551 --> 29:12.819
What?

29:12.853 --> 29:14.556
<i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,
Paddington 2.</i>

29:14.588 --> 29:15.955
Connect those dots.

29:15.990 --> 29:17.367
I mean, I don't wanna
be a snob, but...

29:17.391 --> 29:18.959
I cried through
the entire thing.

29:18.992 --> 29:20.426
It made me want
to be a better man.

29:20.461 --> 29:23.029
Bullshit, man!

29:30.136 --> 29:32.038
<i>Paddington 2</i> is incredible.

29:33.575 --> 29:35.409
I fucking told you.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.348
Truth or dare, Nick?

29:43.217 --> 29:44.285
Truth.

29:49.923 --> 29:53.027
Did you hate my
screenplay? It's okay if you did.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.327
I just need to know.

29:54.361 --> 29:56.195
You wrote a script?

29:56.230 --> 29:58.999
I sent it to your agent.

29:59.032 --> 30:00.277
He was supposed
to give it to you.

30:00.300 --> 30:01.603
Well, he didn't.

30:01.635 --> 30:03.903
I guess I can
understand why he didn't,

30:03.936 --> 30:05.539
but where is it?
I'll read it right now.

30:05.573 --> 30:07.407
Now? Like, right now? Right now.

30:07.441 --> 30:08.442
Send it.

30:19.452 --> 30:21.522
I sent it. Fantastic.

30:21.556 --> 30:25.159
Let's go into town,
have a celebratory drink.

30:25.192 --> 30:27.027
You can watch me read it.

30:27.060 --> 30:28.996
See where it
drags. It'll be fun.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.130
No.

30:31.198 --> 30:33.133
Honestly, I'm too nervous.

30:33.166 --> 30:34.536
My heart is beating so fast.

30:37.605 --> 30:39.239
I think I need to go to bed.

30:40.039 --> 30:44.010
Listen, Javi, truth.

30:44.044 --> 30:46.447
I wasn't that thrilled
about coming out here,

30:46.480 --> 30:49.517
but tonight has
been the most fun

30:49.550 --> 30:52.885
I've had in a long, long time.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.122
So, thank you.

31:12.439 --> 31:14.576
Oh. Hey, Nicky.

31:14.608 --> 31:16.242
So, you're unretired then?

31:16.276 --> 31:18.077
That's the idea.

31:18.112 --> 31:22.415
Javi inspired you, did
he? You like this guy?

31:22.449 --> 31:24.519
He has good taste in movies.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.554
Plus, it could be
good for me to do

31:26.587 --> 31:30.525
some smaller roles
with great directors.

31:30.557 --> 31:32.960
Some challenging character work.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.162
Huh. So, like, um... like what?

31:35.194 --> 31:36.698
The gay uncle

31:36.730 --> 31:39.031
in the next duplass
brothers movie kind of thing?

31:39.066 --> 31:40.334
Exactly.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.970
What the fuck are
you talking about?

31:43.002 --> 31:44.971
We haven't worked
since you were 15...

31:45.005 --> 31:47.441
Forty-one years to
be number seven

31:47.473 --> 31:50.443
on a call sheet of a
goddamn student film.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.045
I think it's a good idea.

31:52.078 --> 31:53.346
You listen to me.

31:53.380 --> 31:56.083
You're Nick fucking...

32:05.759 --> 32:08.461
Cage!

32:08.494 --> 32:10.731
Addy doesn't need a
struggling artist for a father.

32:10.765 --> 32:13.400
She needs you to be a star.

32:13.433 --> 32:16.336
Now you get the next
one, baby, and we're back.

32:16.369 --> 32:17.971
Not that we went anywhere.

32:18.005 --> 32:21.608
Not that we went anywhere.

32:21.643 --> 32:22.942
Come here.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.455
Yeah, Nick cage smooches good.

32:35.489 --> 32:39.425
You tell 'em! Nick
cage smooches good!

32:40.426 --> 32:41.695
I'll have another one.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.276
Jesus!

32:58.177 --> 33:00.113
What do you guys
want? You want money?

33:00.146 --> 33:02.449
Here, take my watch.
It's not a copy, it's real.

33:02.482 --> 33:05.519
Mr. Cage, we're with the U.S.
government. We need your help.

33:05.553 --> 33:07.421
The man you're
staying with is the head

33:07.453 --> 33:09.423
of a violent
international arms cartel.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.692
Wait, wait, wait. Javi?

33:11.726 --> 33:13.560
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

33:13.595 --> 33:15.563
He started small, coastal Spain.

33:15.596 --> 33:17.230
But then, he got greedy.

33:17.263 --> 33:20.233
Trying to expand his
operations east, west.

33:20.267 --> 33:22.102
Trail of dead
bodies in his wake.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.202
Javi Gutierrez?

33:23.237 --> 33:24.705
Yes, Javi.

33:24.739 --> 33:26.349
I don't think we're talking
about the same Javi.

33:26.373 --> 33:27.585
We're definitely talking
about the same fucking Javi.

33:27.608 --> 33:28.619
It's the same fucking guy, man.

33:28.643 --> 33:30.644
Okay, okay. So, you're CIA,

33:30.678 --> 33:32.412
some kind of
intelligence, right?

33:32.445 --> 33:34.314
And your job is to
read people, yeah?

33:34.347 --> 33:36.482
Well, as a thespian,
that is also my job.

33:36.518 --> 33:37.728
To understand
people's characters,

33:37.751 --> 33:39.318
to feel what they're feeling.

33:39.353 --> 33:42.523
Which is how I know that
Javi is not a gun dealer.

33:42.557 --> 33:44.223
You're saying
your acting ability

33:44.258 --> 33:45.826
trumps five years of hard data

33:45.859 --> 33:48.362
collected by the world's
finest intelligence agency?

33:48.394 --> 33:50.731
My nouveau
shamanic acting ability?

33:50.765 --> 33:52.098
You better fucking believe it.

33:52.132 --> 33:54.401
Oh! Hey, guys, this sucks.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.505
Uh, Nicolas cage's nouveau
shamanic acting ability

33:57.538 --> 33:59.574
has determined that
we got the wrong guy.

33:59.606 --> 34:02.142
So, let's pack up our
shit and fucking go home.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.578
Hey, man, don't mind him.
He's all messed up inside.

34:04.612 --> 34:07.114
He just found out his
wife's been fucking his dad.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.817
That's not all the way true.

34:09.851 --> 34:12.219
Look, do you
recognize this girl?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.355
No.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.157
It's Maria delgado.

34:17.190 --> 34:19.293
President of
catalonia's daughter.

34:19.326 --> 34:20.862
Javi's men kidnapped
her two days ago

34:20.893 --> 34:22.405
to force her father
out of the election

34:22.429 --> 34:24.297
and make way for
someone more cartel-friendly.

34:24.331 --> 34:25.766
Yeah, the U.S.
doesn't like that.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.266
Yeah, look, hey.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.603
We need to access
Javi's security cameras.

34:29.637 --> 34:31.114
We can't get anywhere
near that compound

34:31.137 --> 34:32.338
because it's too fortified.

34:33.340 --> 34:34.608
And then, you show up.

34:34.641 --> 34:36.309
So, you want me to, what?

34:36.342 --> 34:37.643
Spy on Javi?

34:37.679 --> 34:39.146
Bingo.

34:39.179 --> 34:40.715
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

34:40.748 --> 34:42.382
You have a daughter
about her age, right?

34:43.717 --> 34:45.318
This came in yesterday.

34:47.889 --> 34:50.456
How do you think
you would feel, huh?

34:50.489 --> 34:52.458
Knowing you could have helped?

34:52.492 --> 34:54.161
<i>But you chose not to.</i>

34:55.630 --> 34:58.565
<i>Be a lot of guilt to
carry, wouldn't it?</i>

34:58.599 --> 35:01.702
<i>Because every time
you look at your daughter,</i>

35:01.735 --> 35:03.302
<i>believe me,</i>

35:03.336 --> 35:05.706
<i>you are gonna
see that little girl</i>

35:05.739 --> 35:08.307
<i>buried in a ditch somewhere.</i>

35:08.342 --> 35:10.376
<i>And that will haunt you</i>

35:10.409 --> 35:13.681
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

35:22.824 --> 35:24.458
<i>All right, here we go, Nick.</i>

35:24.490 --> 35:26.202
<i>We're going to create
a power blip big enough</i>

35:26.226 --> 35:27.929
<i>to reboot all the
security cameras.</i>

35:27.961 --> 35:29.697
<i>Once that happens,</i>

35:29.731 --> 35:31.599
<i>you got exactly four
minutes and ten seconds</i>

35:31.632 --> 35:33.635
<i>to get in and get out before
they come back online.</i>

36:35.829 --> 36:37.565
<i>Don't forget. Set the cameras,</i>

36:37.597 --> 36:39.733
<i>and then grab them
when you leave.</i>

36:48.976 --> 36:50.744
Uh-oh. Oh, shit, we
got a guy coming.

36:50.777 --> 36:52.278
<i>Nick, guard on the way.</i>

36:52.311 --> 36:53.523
<i>All right, Nick, stay calm.</i>

36:53.547 --> 36:55.016
<i>Just like we talked about.</i>

36:55.048 --> 36:57.784
Take the incapacitating
agent out of the pouch.

36:57.818 --> 36:58.920
<i>Put it in your hand.</i>

36:58.952 --> 37:00.554
<i>Remove the outer layer.</i>

37:00.588 --> 37:02.590
<i>The inner layer has
the chemical on it.</i>

37:02.623 --> 37:03.967
<i>Now, if you touch
that to someone's skin,</i>

37:03.990 --> 37:05.525
<i>they'll be out in seconds.</i>

37:07.293 --> 37:08.695
<i>Now, find a place to hide.</i>

37:09.797 --> 37:11.532
There's nowhere to hide in here.

37:12.532 --> 37:13.568
Hold on.

37:17.304 --> 37:19.005
I think I can hide under the...

37:20.007 --> 37:21.641
I touched my forehead.

37:21.675 --> 37:23.043
You touched your forehead?

37:23.077 --> 37:24.746
I think so. I'm not 100% sure.

37:24.778 --> 37:26.278
Did you or didn't you?

37:26.313 --> 37:27.673
You know what?
I don't think I did.

37:31.518 --> 37:33.588
I did. I did.

37:33.621 --> 37:35.422
<i>Nick, listen to me right now.</i>

37:35.454 --> 37:37.067
You have 30 seconds until
you're drooling on the floor.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.927
<i>Go back into the pouch
and get the antidote asap.</i>

37:43.664 --> 37:45.297
It's locked.

37:45.331 --> 37:46.643
<i>Where's the
key that we gave you?</i>

37:46.666 --> 37:48.969
Inside with the antidote.

37:49.003 --> 37:52.304
Oh, fuck this shit!
Okay. Oh, shit. Okay.

37:55.809 --> 37:57.911
<i>Okay, Nick,
there's a window to your left.</i>

37:57.945 --> 37:59.981
Go out that window, get outside,

38:00.014 --> 38:01.481
go across the ledge, okay?

38:01.516 --> 38:03.083
Scoot across the ledge,

38:03.117 --> 38:04.877
<i>and then climb into the
security room window.</i>

38:06.385 --> 38:07.597
What the fuck is wrong with
you? He's three stories up.

38:07.621 --> 38:08.742
He's stoned out of his mind.

38:12.927 --> 38:13.927
<i>Hola.</i>

38:15.762 --> 38:18.498
<i>Do it now, Nick!
Now! He's getting closer.</i>

38:18.532 --> 38:20.432
He's fucking dead. He's dead.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.036
Martin, I can hear you.

38:34.614 --> 38:36.416
Come on, Nick. You
can do this, okay?

38:36.449 --> 38:38.451
Keep moving. Keep moving.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.454
<i>Hola?</i>

38:47.061 --> 38:49.664
I can't feel my legs.

38:49.697 --> 38:51.699
You know, I really
enjoyed working for the CIA.

38:51.731 --> 38:54.101
Can't wait to move back
home and work at fucking Sonic.

38:54.835 --> 38:55.836
Shit!

38:57.403 --> 38:59.405
Like rubber.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.943
Come on, Nick, you got
this. Keep moving, okay?

39:06.813 --> 39:08.815
<i>Hold on. We got a
guard in the room.</i>

39:12.119 --> 39:13.485
<i>Wake up, Nick.</i>

39:15.623 --> 39:17.625
<i>Okay, go, go, go, Nick.</i>

39:17.657 --> 39:19.726
I love you.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.996
<i>Stay with me. Stay awake.</i>

39:22.028 --> 39:24.097
<i>Keep moving. You can do this.</i>

39:24.130 --> 39:25.599
<i>Pull your legs in now.</i>

39:25.632 --> 39:26.934
<i>Pull your legs in.</i>

39:32.606 --> 39:34.108
I can't move.

39:34.141 --> 39:36.043
Then you're gonna die.
Do you wanna die tonight?

39:36.077 --> 39:37.777
This is not how you die.

39:37.811 --> 39:39.579
I think it is.

39:49.190 --> 39:50.657
Come on.

39:50.690 --> 39:52.193
Come on, you did
it. You're in there.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.827
Do it, do it! Stay awake!

39:53.860 --> 39:55.630
<i>Come on! Come on, Nick!</i>

39:56.764 --> 39:58.065
Come on. Come on.

39:58.099 --> 39:59.431
Come on. You got it.

39:59.465 --> 40:00.967
You got it. You got it.

40:01.001 --> 40:02.135
You got it. You got it.

40:04.704 --> 40:06.940
Oh, for fuck's sake,
man! Wake up!

40:06.974 --> 40:08.085
<i>Wake up. Wake up.</i>

40:08.108 --> 40:09.809
<i>Get up, Nick. Get up.</i>

40:09.844 --> 40:10.945
<i>Get up.</i>

40:11.878 --> 40:12.914
Come on, Nick.

40:12.947 --> 40:15.081
Come on! Get up!

40:15.115 --> 40:16.483
<i>Get up, Nick.</i>

40:20.655 --> 40:21.688
Action!

40:26.594 --> 40:27.994
Oh, my god!

40:28.028 --> 40:29.630
Yes!

40:29.664 --> 40:31.699
How is he up? Trained actor.

40:31.731 --> 40:33.233
All right, man, we in.

40:33.266 --> 40:36.871
You know, it didn't feel
great betraying Javi like that.

40:36.903 --> 40:39.840
Especially, since I'm still
not convinced he's your guy.

40:39.873 --> 40:41.708
But the strange thing is...

40:41.742 --> 40:42.885
I can see myself
doing more of this stuff.

40:42.909 --> 40:44.644
You know, spycraft.

40:44.679 --> 40:46.847
Subterfuge. What have you.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.615
I think I might
have a real gift for it.

40:48.648 --> 40:50.583
Good, 'cause we got
another mission for you.

40:50.617 --> 40:53.054
No, no, no! Fuck that!

40:53.086 --> 40:54.822
It was terrifying.

40:54.855 --> 40:56.934
I'm about to leave for the
airport after the party, so...

40:56.958 --> 41:00.527
Nick, our intel suggests that
Javi is holding Maria delgado

41:00.561 --> 41:02.530
on the compound right now.

41:02.563 --> 41:04.030
On the compound? <i>Yeah.</i>

41:04.065 --> 41:05.733
We need you to help us find her.

41:05.766 --> 41:07.034
Which means we need you

41:07.068 --> 41:08.936
to figure out a way
to stay a little longer.

41:08.969 --> 41:12.873
Vivian, I can't do this.

41:12.907 --> 41:14.909
Yes, you can. We
just saw you do it.

41:15.842 --> 41:17.244
That little girl, Nick?

41:17.277 --> 41:18.846
She doesn't have anybody else.

41:20.780 --> 41:21.782
<i>Just you.</i>

41:23.117 --> 41:25.186
<i>And if you leave,</i>

41:25.219 --> 41:27.588
<i>I don't know what's
gonna happen to her.</i>

41:43.204 --> 41:45.940
I just want to thank you
all for coming tonight.

41:45.972 --> 41:48.041
It means more to me
than you can know.

41:48.074 --> 41:50.210
And I would like
to tell a story.

41:51.144 --> 41:53.114
A few years ago,

41:53.146 --> 41:55.048
my relationship with my father

41:55.081 --> 41:57.117
had deteriorated to the point

41:57.150 --> 41:59.987
where we were
no longer speaking.

42:00.021 --> 42:01.164
He could be extremely difficult,

42:01.188 --> 42:02.789
my father.

42:02.822 --> 42:04.692
And to be fair, maybe
I am not much better.

42:07.161 --> 42:08.695
But when he got sick,

42:09.896 --> 42:11.831
I realized

42:11.865 --> 42:13.601
I didn't want to lose him

42:13.634 --> 42:16.771
before we could repair
our broken relationship.

42:17.871 --> 42:19.172
But I didn't know how.

42:20.141 --> 42:21.675
And then, one day,

42:21.708 --> 42:24.844
about a week before
he died, it happened.

42:24.878 --> 42:25.980
A miracle.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.947
I looked up...

42:30.384 --> 42:33.820
And I saw on a tiny
little hospital TV...

42:33.853 --> 42:36.657
<i>Guarding Tess.</i>

42:36.690 --> 42:40.795
We disagreed about literally
everything, my father and I.

42:40.827 --> 42:42.096
Except for this movie.

42:43.396 --> 42:45.266
We both loved it.

42:45.298 --> 42:48.235
We would quote
it back and forth.

42:48.268 --> 42:51.371
In a way, my father was Tess.

42:51.405 --> 42:52.873
The former first lady.

42:52.907 --> 42:55.842
And I was Doug chesnic.

42:55.876 --> 42:57.077
The secret service agent

42:57.110 --> 42:58.746
charged with taking care of him.

43:00.815 --> 43:04.784
That movie brought us together.

43:06.719 --> 43:10.858
So, on behalf of my
late father and myself,

43:12.893 --> 43:14.260
I want to thank you.

43:19.333 --> 43:21.335
I bet you didn't know
Doug chesnic could have

43:21.367 --> 43:23.269
such an impact on someone.

43:23.304 --> 43:26.806
Well, Doug was
a complicated guy.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.275
He had, um,

43:29.409 --> 43:30.945
competing allegiances

43:30.978 --> 43:32.313
and sometimes,

43:32.346 --> 43:35.782
being in the skin of
a character like that

43:36.884 --> 43:38.351
can take its toll.

43:38.385 --> 43:39.887
Well, thank you
for your sacrifice.

43:39.920 --> 43:41.222
It was extraordinary.

43:41.255 --> 43:42.956
Thank you for having me.

43:44.458 --> 43:45.693
And i'm...

43:48.695 --> 43:49.797
I'm...

43:51.097 --> 43:53.400
Excited to announce that

43:53.434 --> 43:58.371
Javi has finally allowed
me to read his screenplay

43:58.405 --> 44:00.708
which is fantastic.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.742
It's truly a masterclass.

44:02.775 --> 44:05.346
It's easily one of the best
things I've read in years.

44:05.378 --> 44:07.347
So, does that mean
that you want to be in it?

44:07.380 --> 44:08.414
I don't.

44:08.449 --> 44:11.885
But what I would like is to

44:11.918 --> 44:14.188
spend a little more time here

44:14.221 --> 44:17.391
on the compound with you.

44:17.423 --> 44:19.360
Coming up with our own...

44:20.293 --> 44:21.427
Movie.

44:22.195 --> 44:23.264
What do you say?

44:26.266 --> 44:27.300
I say yes.

44:29.503 --> 44:30.704
Yes.

44:36.277 --> 44:38.112
<i>I fired Earl.</i>

44:38.144 --> 44:39.322
<i>- This has happened twice now.
- No.</i>

44:39.346 --> 44:40.813
<i>He is a driver</i>

44:40.847 --> 44:43.250
<i>in the employ of
the secret service.</i>

44:43.284 --> 44:44.728
<i>I can't do anything about
the cook or the nurse.</i>

44:44.751 --> 44:46.219
<i>No, they work for you.</i>

44:46.253 --> 44:47.987
<i>But this guy works
for us and he's gone!</i>

44:52.293 --> 44:54.128
<i>Nick.</i>

44:54.161 --> 44:56.338
The security cameras gave
us a probable location for Maria.

44:56.362 --> 44:59.032
I'm sending it to you now.

44:59.065 --> 45:00.701
<i>Find a way to get
into that room, Nick.</i>

45:05.206 --> 45:06.206
Mr. Cage.

45:07.273 --> 45:09.342
Oh, hey, Javi. Nick.

45:09.376 --> 45:11.378
I realized

45:11.411 --> 45:15.416
that if we are going
to create a work of art,

45:15.449 --> 45:17.384
we can't just sit and
stare at a screen.

45:18.318 --> 45:19.521
We have to open our minds

45:19.554 --> 45:21.054
to the infinite possibilities

45:21.088 --> 45:22.489
of what the cosmos has to offer.

45:24.391 --> 45:25.858
What have you got there?

45:25.893 --> 45:27.393
Divine inspiration.

45:35.902 --> 45:37.905
Fuck it!

45:57.224 --> 45:59.326
So, I was thinking
that maybe our movie

45:59.360 --> 46:01.061
would be character-driven.

46:01.094 --> 46:02.862
Yeah.

46:02.896 --> 46:06.467
Something that doesn't
rely on corny special effects.

46:06.501 --> 46:08.969
Right. Or like big explosions.

46:09.003 --> 46:10.505
It has to be nuanced.

46:10.538 --> 46:12.472
And work on multiple levels.

46:12.507 --> 46:15.275
It should be completely
about performance.

46:15.309 --> 46:18.344
And maybe it's just
the drugs talking,

46:18.378 --> 46:21.114
but what if we had
like a big drug scene?

46:21.148 --> 46:24.251
Oh, wow!

46:25.885 --> 46:27.954
It's gonna be so fucking good.

46:30.257 --> 46:31.257
But, like,

46:32.425 --> 46:33.527
what's it about?

46:42.101 --> 46:44.304
<i>In terms of
genre, I like comedies.</i>

46:44.338 --> 46:47.474
But not when it's just two
people sitting around talking.

46:47.509 --> 46:51.210
Oh, man, I can't
stand talkie comedies.

46:51.244 --> 46:53.581
You gotta have some
plot to drive it forward.

47:00.954 --> 47:01.954
It's my daughter.

47:02.356 --> 47:03.389
Oh.

47:18.639 --> 47:19.840
Nick, listen.

47:21.141 --> 47:23.376
You know what I was thinking?

47:23.409 --> 47:26.480
Maybe we could have, like,
a paranoid thriller-y angle.

47:26.514 --> 47:30.117
Ooh. Paranoid angle. Excellent.

47:30.150 --> 47:31.550
Like, see those
two guys over there?

47:33.454 --> 47:34.588
They've been watching us.

47:34.621 --> 47:36.056
Right. Right.

47:38.257 --> 47:40.094
Wait, have they
been watching us?

47:40.126 --> 47:42.096
I don't know. Have they?

47:44.498 --> 47:47.333
Fuck!

47:47.367 --> 47:49.335
Did you see that? They
just looked over at us.

47:49.369 --> 47:51.371
Oh, shit!

47:51.405 --> 47:53.974
Oh, shit! What's going on?

47:54.007 --> 47:55.418
No, no, no. Maybe it
was just a coincidence.

47:55.442 --> 47:56.909
I will look again.
Are you ready?

47:56.943 --> 47:58.144
No! Don't make eye contact.

47:58.177 --> 47:59.614
That's how you spook them.

47:59.646 --> 48:01.682
No, that's how you spook a bear.

48:01.715 --> 48:03.983
That's right. That is
how you spook a bear.

48:04.016 --> 48:05.586
I apologize.

48:05.619 --> 48:08.989
But if you are gonna look,
maybe do like a fake laugh.

48:09.021 --> 48:10.657
A fake laugh? Okay, good. Yeah.

48:18.733 --> 48:20.166
Oh, no.

48:20.199 --> 48:22.969
Okay, okay. Let's...

48:23.003 --> 48:25.371
Let's just get up slowly

48:25.405 --> 48:27.106
on the count of three

48:27.141 --> 48:28.543
and run.

48:28.576 --> 48:30.110
Okay?

48:30.143 --> 48:31.177
One...

48:32.211 --> 48:33.213
Oh, fuck!

48:38.585 --> 48:39.987
Go, go, go!

48:41.054 --> 48:42.155
Faster!

48:43.757 --> 48:45.259
This is fucking crazy.

48:46.460 --> 48:47.561
Oh, shit!

48:47.594 --> 48:48.663
It's too high.

48:48.695 --> 48:50.197
Here.

48:51.465 --> 48:53.467
Use me as a human stool.

48:54.467 --> 48:55.570
Do it!

49:04.277 --> 49:05.278
Grab my hand.

49:06.112 --> 49:07.114
Grab it.

49:11.083 --> 49:12.351
You're heavier than you look.

49:16.422 --> 49:17.625
I have a very big head.

49:17.659 --> 49:20.027
Enormous. An enormous head.

49:22.329 --> 49:24.632
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

49:24.666 --> 49:26.534
Will you tell Gabriela
I will miss her?

49:26.568 --> 49:28.434
You can tell her yourself. No.

49:28.469 --> 49:31.103
It's okay. You
go live a good life.

49:31.137 --> 49:32.483
I'm not going
anywhere without you!

49:32.507 --> 49:35.175
Now, grab my hand, soldier!

49:41.248 --> 49:43.115
But then, we will both die

49:43.150 --> 49:45.085
and I could never live
with myself after that.

49:45.117 --> 49:46.353
So you let go.

49:47.454 --> 49:48.454
You let go!

49:55.630 --> 49:57.130
Goodbye, Nicolas cage.

49:58.800 --> 50:02.034
I'll never forget you, javs.

50:02.068 --> 50:03.505
I'll never forget you.

50:05.172 --> 50:07.340
Now, you get the
hell out of here.

50:09.275 --> 50:11.010
You go!

50:23.090 --> 50:24.224
Mr. Cage?

50:26.193 --> 50:27.193
Javi?

50:28.295 --> 50:29.630
Buddy! Hey.

50:30.532 --> 50:31.798
Where'd you come from?

50:33.099 --> 50:34.101
Oh.

50:35.268 --> 50:36.302
Yeah...

50:38.105 --> 50:39.617
Turns out we could
have just walked around.

50:39.641 --> 50:41.708
Yeah, I guess so, huh? Whatever.

50:43.710 --> 50:44.811
There they are.

50:46.480 --> 50:48.815
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Run!

50:51.150 --> 50:52.519
Do you see 'em?

50:52.554 --> 50:54.722
Oh, fuck! Oh!

50:54.755 --> 50:56.088
Shit!

50:57.356 --> 50:58.358
Ow, ow.

51:01.896 --> 51:04.398
No, no. I can't drive on
acid. I can't drive on acid.

51:04.431 --> 51:05.632
You have to drive on acid.

51:05.666 --> 51:07.199
You are a better driver than me.

51:07.233 --> 51:08.869
How do you know that?

51:08.902 --> 51:10.179
Because I read that you did
all of your own driving stunts

51:10.202 --> 51:11.639
in <i>gone in 60 seconds.</i>

51:11.672 --> 51:14.240
Well, that's true. I popped
some good wheelies, right?

51:14.273 --> 51:16.577
The wheelies are
amazing. Now drive the car!

51:16.610 --> 51:18.478
They're coming! Let's go!

51:31.391 --> 51:33.795
Oh. Holy shit! What?

51:33.827 --> 51:35.228
Holy shit!

51:35.262 --> 51:36.295
What? Do you see 'em?

51:36.329 --> 51:39.166
No, Nick, I have an idea.

51:39.199 --> 51:41.869
Maybe this movie,
maybe it's about this.

51:41.902 --> 51:43.538
About us.

51:43.570 --> 51:45.405
Our relationship.

51:47.507 --> 51:48.576
That's good.

51:50.277 --> 51:51.378
That's good.

52:28.949 --> 52:30.585
Is anyone in there?

52:30.617 --> 52:31.753
<i>Hola?</i>

52:31.786 --> 52:32.786
Hello?

52:34.454 --> 52:35.489
Hello?

52:39.326 --> 52:41.360
You want me to let
you in there, huh?

52:42.864 --> 52:43.864
I do.

52:44.931 --> 52:46.501
I wanna know what's inside.

52:46.534 --> 52:48.702
Regardless of what
the consequences are?

52:58.012 --> 52:59.880
Because once you go in there,

53:01.682 --> 53:03.717
it could change the
way you feel about me.

53:09.956 --> 53:12.793
Our entire relationship
could change, Nick cage.

53:15.394 --> 53:17.264
I need to go in, jav.

53:18.532 --> 53:19.934
Open the door.

53:49.996 --> 53:51.498
Is it too much?

53:52.431 --> 53:53.534
Trippy.

53:54.768 --> 53:56.302
Trippy.

53:56.335 --> 53:58.806
I know. I am
sorry if it is weird.

53:58.840 --> 54:00.807
Well, it's a good collection.

54:02.043 --> 54:04.878
It's very thorough.

54:04.911 --> 54:07.981
"A really elegant string
of pearls configuration."

54:09.050 --> 54:10.317
<i>The rock.</i>

54:10.349 --> 54:12.987
"Put the bunny back in the box."

54:13.019 --> 54:14.454
<i>Con air.</i>

54:16.489 --> 54:19.527
Well, that's just really creepy.

54:19.559 --> 54:21.027
No, it's not creepy.

54:21.061 --> 54:22.496
Oh.

54:22.530 --> 54:23.931
Is that the chainsaw from <i>Mandy?</i>

54:23.965 --> 54:25.032
<i>Mandy</i> is a masterpiece.

54:27.034 --> 54:28.835
You know those
are real guns, right?

54:28.869 --> 54:30.538
Of course they are real.

54:32.974 --> 54:35.909
Custom Springfield armory.

54:35.943 --> 54:38.913
Made specifically for the film.

54:38.945 --> 54:40.815
Is this supposed to be me?

54:41.548 --> 54:42.682
It's...

54:43.349 --> 54:44.585
Grotesque.

54:44.619 --> 54:46.820
Just look at the guns.

54:46.853 --> 54:48.755
If you don't mind me asking,

54:48.789 --> 54:50.992
how much did you pay for this

54:51.893 --> 54:53.827
disturbing statue?

54:53.860 --> 54:56.063
Hmm. About $6,000.

54:57.764 --> 54:59.599
I'll give you $20,000 for it.

55:00.934 --> 55:02.702
I'm sorry, Mr. Cage,

55:04.539 --> 55:05.972
but this is not for sale.

55:13.748 --> 55:15.481
<i>Bad news. Girl's not there.</i>

55:15.516 --> 55:18.585
Good news. Script's cooking.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.887
Feels like cassavetes
meets inarritu

55:20.922 --> 55:22.422
with a dash of Von trier.

55:22.454 --> 55:24.791
Nick, but... I know
what you're gonna say.

55:24.826 --> 55:27.128
Javi has his issues but, my god,

55:27.161 --> 55:30.362
he has an unbelievably
intuitive sense for story.

55:30.396 --> 55:31.998
He kidnapped a young girl.

55:32.032 --> 55:34.534
And every day that passes,
the likelihood goes up

55:34.568 --> 55:37.572
that she's gonna be murdered
by Javi or one of his men.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.472
What do you want me to do now?

55:40.507 --> 55:41.675
I don't know.

55:41.708 --> 55:43.744
I'm still figuring that out.

55:43.777 --> 55:46.614
But for now, why don't you
add a plotline to your movie

55:46.646 --> 55:48.048
where someone gets kidnapped?

55:48.081 --> 55:49.717
That way you can see

55:49.750 --> 55:51.918
where he might,
theoretically, hide a hostage.

55:51.952 --> 55:53.820
I'm working two jobs here.

55:54.621 --> 55:55.655
Okay.

55:57.657 --> 55:59.626
Vivian,

55:59.659 --> 56:02.096
this is a grounded, adult drama

56:02.128 --> 56:04.396
about two tough, sensitive men

56:04.431 --> 56:05.833
and their unlikely friendship.

56:05.867 --> 56:07.577
They're kind of like
dueling Christ figures.

56:07.601 --> 56:11.137
Which is obviously a pretty
revolutionary idea in itself.

56:11.172 --> 56:13.641
But what is not

56:13.673 --> 56:16.643
a revolutionary
idea is a kidnapping.

56:16.677 --> 56:18.512
And if I bring
that into the mix,

56:18.545 --> 56:19.756
Javi's gonna know
something's up.

56:19.780 --> 56:20.947
He's a hardliner for tone,

56:20.981 --> 56:23.050
and this mission
will be blown. Okay?

56:23.083 --> 56:24.818
Jesus fucking Christ!

56:27.755 --> 56:28.789
You know, Nick,

56:28.822 --> 56:30.157
I think a kidnapping

56:30.190 --> 56:32.960
could give this
movie a wider appeal.

56:32.994 --> 56:34.561
I mean, it's pretty hard

56:34.594 --> 56:36.496
to find an audience
these days, right?

56:36.530 --> 56:38.865
Unless you're a marvel movie,
<i>star wars,</i> whatever, yeah.

56:38.900 --> 56:40.210
Yeah, doesn't
sound like this is that.

56:40.233 --> 56:41.702
No, Vivian, it isn't.

56:41.735 --> 56:43.871
This is an intelligent
film for grown-ups.

56:43.905 --> 56:45.539
Now, personally,

56:45.572 --> 56:49.543
I want a smart,
character-driven, adult drama

56:49.577 --> 56:52.112
about real life, real people.

56:52.146 --> 56:53.748
But the reality is,

56:53.780 --> 56:56.516
most people need a bit of a hook

56:56.550 --> 56:57.885
to get 'em into the theater.

56:57.918 --> 56:59.586
Okay, now you're
talking about marketing.

56:59.619 --> 57:01.155
And if you're talking
about marketing,

57:01.188 --> 57:03.925
then, yes, you do need a
hook to get them into the theater.

57:03.958 --> 57:05.992
Well, get 'em into
the theater. Come on.

57:06.027 --> 57:08.427
All you need is
a trailer moment.

57:09.163 --> 57:10.429
Pull!

57:13.833 --> 57:16.570
Hold on, hold on. Your
daughter gets kidnapped?

57:16.603 --> 57:18.005
Yeah, it's a big trailer moment.

57:18.039 --> 57:19.539
Hey, am I doing this right?

57:19.572 --> 57:20.951
'Cause I had that
thing in my sights.

57:20.974 --> 57:22.043
But who kidnaps her?

57:22.076 --> 57:23.543
Uh, maybe the barrel's warped.

57:23.577 --> 57:24.588
The barrel is
definitely not warped.

57:24.612 --> 57:25.612
Who kidnaps her?

57:26.246 --> 57:27.614
Bad guys.

57:28.615 --> 57:29.817
We both put our lives

57:29.849 --> 57:30.961
on the line to save the daughter

57:30.985 --> 57:32.128
and become better men for it.

57:32.152 --> 57:33.721
It's classic.

57:33.753 --> 57:34.798
It feels like a completely
different movie.

57:34.822 --> 57:36.157
Javi, please.

57:36.190 --> 57:37.925
Just walk down the
road with me on this.

57:37.958 --> 57:39.626
And then what?

57:39.659 --> 57:42.730
The finale is about
two men saving the girl?

57:42.762 --> 57:44.097
That's terrible.

57:44.130 --> 57:45.599
Give me the gun.

57:47.702 --> 57:49.469
You know the key
to shooting well?

57:51.005 --> 57:52.539
Controlling your breath.

57:54.208 --> 57:56.143
And you know how to
control your breath, Nick?

57:57.177 --> 57:58.579
Your heart.

57:58.612 --> 58:01.215
Your heart must be still.

58:01.248 --> 58:02.583
At peace.

58:03.918 --> 58:05.619
My heart

58:05.652 --> 58:07.054
is not still.

58:07.088 --> 58:08.856
My heart

58:08.889 --> 58:09.889
is not at peace.

58:13.661 --> 58:14.829
Do you know why?

58:14.862 --> 58:16.197
Hey, Javi.

58:16.230 --> 58:18.733
If you're not gonna shoot,
maybe hand me the gun?

58:18.766 --> 58:20.233
Because you're lying to me.

58:20.266 --> 58:21.302
What?

58:21.335 --> 58:24.804
Don't fucking lie to me.

58:24.838 --> 58:25.905
I'm not!

58:25.940 --> 58:28.641
Don't fucking lie to me!

58:28.675 --> 58:30.277
Oh, my god, I'm not! I swear!

58:30.311 --> 58:32.813
I know why you keep on
talking about this kidnapped girl.

58:34.280 --> 58:35.882
You feel guilty about
your relationship

58:35.916 --> 58:37.050
to your own daughter.

58:39.186 --> 58:41.222
Oh, my god, yes.

58:41.255 --> 58:43.824
A thousand times,
yes. You are blocked.

58:43.858 --> 58:45.760
Creatively.

58:45.793 --> 58:47.128
Because you feel guilty

58:47.161 --> 58:48.963
about what kind of
father you have been.

58:48.996 --> 58:51.065
You're right. Yep.

58:51.097 --> 58:52.132
You're 100% right.

58:52.166 --> 58:53.233
Pull!

59:13.286 --> 59:15.222
Vivian, what's going on?

59:15.255 --> 59:17.625
Nick, you need to get out
of that house immediately.

59:17.657 --> 59:19.626
<i>The agency caught a
wiretap on our phones.</i>

59:19.659 --> 59:21.295
<i>Then I picked up
a guy tailing me.</i>

59:21.327 --> 59:23.898
If they've made me,
they've likely made you.

59:23.931 --> 59:25.331
All right. Shit.

59:25.365 --> 59:27.601
<i>Nick, we can no longer
guarantee your safety.</i>

59:29.670 --> 59:30.704
Jesus Christ!

59:30.737 --> 59:32.005
You scared the hell out of me.

59:32.039 --> 59:33.773
Nick,

59:33.807 --> 59:35.208
I need you to come with me.

59:37.710 --> 59:38.778
Right now?

59:41.815 --> 59:44.318
I'm sorry to have to
take this step, Nick.

59:45.820 --> 59:48.255
You don't,
though. You really don't.

59:48.289 --> 59:49.989
No, it is the only option.

59:51.425 --> 59:54.195
Can I just call
my family quickly?

59:54.228 --> 59:55.762
Tell them I love them.

59:56.297 --> 59:57.731
What?

59:57.764 --> 59:59.733
There's no need to call them.

59:59.766 --> 01:00:00.800
They are here.

01:00:02.068 --> 01:00:03.137
Dad. Nick.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.237
Are you okay? What...

01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:06.039
What the hell is going on?

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:07.173
Your friend called to say

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:09.009
you were so sick
you couldn't talk.

01:00:09.043 --> 01:00:10.911
We're worried about you. Yeah.

01:00:10.945 --> 01:00:12.813
You wanna deal with me,
Javi? You deal with me.

01:00:12.847 --> 01:00:14.248
But I'm begging you, please,

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.815
please leave my
family out of this.

01:00:15.849 --> 01:00:17.059
Unfortunately, I can't do that.

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:18.184
You've left me no choice.

01:00:18.219 --> 01:00:20.387
Are you dying, dad? Yes.

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:21.688
Oh, my god. What?

01:00:21.722 --> 01:00:23.324
Creatively. Oh, come on.

01:00:23.356 --> 01:00:24.925
No, physically,
he is tremendous.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:27.760
I mean, he will
probably outlive us all.

01:00:27.795 --> 01:00:29.396
So, you're not even sick?

01:00:29.429 --> 01:00:30.831
I'm okay, honey.

01:00:30.864 --> 01:00:32.666
I'm fine. I'm okay. Fuck you.

01:00:32.699 --> 01:00:35.335
Look, I have grown to care
very deeply about your father.

01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:36.936
And ex-husband.

01:00:36.971 --> 01:00:38.338
We are working
on a movie together.

01:00:38.371 --> 01:00:42.710
A beautiful
character-driven, adult drama.

01:00:42.742 --> 01:00:46.847
But he has so many
unresolved issues with you

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.983
that it is beginning
to bleed into the work

01:00:49.016 --> 01:00:50.083
in a negative way.

01:00:50.117 --> 01:00:51.284
Isn't that right, Nick?

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:53.853
Are you both out of
your fucking minds?

01:00:53.887 --> 01:00:55.755
Well, you see, he
has so many regrets.

01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:58.391
Yeah. Well, here is
another one to add to the list.

01:00:58.425 --> 01:00:59.960
We've been on a plane.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.996
All day!

01:01:02.028 --> 01:01:03.197
I had to cancel clients.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.898
We were panicking

01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:05.865
because we couldn't find
anyone to feed the cats.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:07.168
You know, they could be dead

01:01:07.201 --> 01:01:08.969
by the time we get
home after this bullshit.

01:01:09.003 --> 01:01:10.971
House smelling like a
dead cat. That's great.

01:01:11.005 --> 01:01:12.373
That's fun.

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.208
Well, I had a cat die
in the kitchen once.

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.809
And my grandmother
was never able

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:18.144
to get rid of the smell.

01:01:18.179 --> 01:01:19.813
I am very sorry for
the inconvenience,

01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:21.315
but this is an emergency.

01:01:21.347 --> 01:01:23.483
Have lunch with us.

01:01:23.518 --> 01:01:25.219
And let him say
what he has to say.

01:01:25.251 --> 01:01:26.987
Don't you think that's
a good idea, Nick?

01:01:30.123 --> 01:01:33.460
Lunch is a wonderful idea, Javi.

01:01:33.494 --> 01:01:36.829
And then, afterwards,
they can go home, right?

01:01:38.965 --> 01:01:40.166
Great.

01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:41.902
Let's have some fucking tapas.

01:01:43.505 --> 01:01:45.005
This is so weird.

01:01:45.039 --> 01:01:46.373
Yeah, well... that's...

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.809
What'd you expect?

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:52.913
I wanna apologize
to both of you.

01:01:54.481 --> 01:01:56.849
I think I should have
been more present

01:01:56.884 --> 01:01:58.985
while I was at home.

01:01:59.018 --> 01:02:03.356
I didn't always need to
be focused on my work.

01:02:03.389 --> 01:02:05.893
My face in a script.

01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.065
But here's what I
keep coming back to.

01:02:11.097 --> 01:02:14.335
Would either of you
have wanted to prevent me

01:02:14.367 --> 01:02:16.070
from living my artistic dreams?

01:02:16.103 --> 01:02:18.838
Because I sure know I
wouldn't have wanted that

01:02:18.871 --> 01:02:20.306
for either of you.

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.179
We flew to majorca for that?

01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:27.815
Wow.

01:02:27.847 --> 01:02:29.382
That was fucking pathetic.

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.085
God, it really was, wasn't it?

01:02:31.117 --> 01:02:32.557
No, no, no. I am
honestly speechless.

01:02:32.586 --> 01:02:35.289
Really? Because this
shit, you get used to it.

01:02:35.322 --> 01:02:37.123
Yeah, that's pretty
much par for the course.

01:02:37.157 --> 01:02:38.192
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:42.429
Can't we just focus

01:02:42.463 --> 01:02:45.266
on the good times
we did have together?

01:02:45.298 --> 01:02:48.802
Addy, that trip we
took across the desert.

01:02:48.835 --> 01:02:50.505
I never showed you this before,

01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:52.507
but I keep this little
photo in my wallet

01:02:52.539 --> 01:02:55.510
to remind me of
all the fun we had.

01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:57.579
And, uh,

01:02:57.612 --> 01:03:00.179
I know it wasn't great,

01:03:00.213 --> 01:03:01.849
but that song...

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:04.552
I meant that moment
that I wrote in that song.

01:03:04.585 --> 01:03:06.019
I meant it.

01:03:06.052 --> 01:03:07.920
You didn't write it.

01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:09.289
You got drunk
and you made it up,

01:03:09.322 --> 01:03:10.592
because you couldn't stand

01:03:10.625 --> 01:03:12.159
not being the
center of attention

01:03:12.192 --> 01:03:13.293
for two fucking seconds.

01:03:13.327 --> 01:03:14.827
Addy.

01:03:14.862 --> 01:03:17.431
Because everything
always has to be about you.

01:03:18.498 --> 01:03:20.166
What you like.

01:03:20.199 --> 01:03:21.434
What books you've read.

01:03:21.467 --> 01:03:23.070
What movies you're into.

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:25.873
It's fucked up, you know?

01:03:26.907 --> 01:03:28.342
Like, I'm your daughter

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:31.344
and I get nervous.

01:03:31.378 --> 01:03:33.581
Like, debilitating
fucking anxiety

01:03:33.614 --> 01:03:35.382
that if I don't
like what you like,

01:03:35.416 --> 01:03:37.483
you won't like me.

01:03:37.518 --> 01:03:41.623
Addy, I was sharing the things
that were meaningful to me.

01:03:41.655 --> 01:03:42.922
That were important to me.

01:03:42.956 --> 01:03:45.125
No, you weren't. You weren't.

01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:46.360
You were trying to mold me

01:03:46.393 --> 01:03:48.027
into this little version of you.

01:03:48.461 --> 01:03:49.963
Mold you?

01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:52.298
Guide you. Addy, I love you.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:55.503
I love you more than
anything in the world.

01:03:55.536 --> 01:03:59.072
And I want you to
know I was trying.

01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:00.940
I know. I know you were trying.

01:04:01.643 --> 01:04:04.077
You're always trying.

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.347
Fuck, that's actually
the saddest part.

01:04:12.485 --> 01:04:14.355
Shit.

01:04:14.387 --> 01:04:16.748
I think we have more work
than I realized, but this is good.

01:04:18.157 --> 01:04:19.561
This is very good.

01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:21.461
This is a good first step.

01:04:23.996 --> 01:04:25.932
Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Gutierrez,

01:04:25.965 --> 01:04:27.635
but you have a visitor.

01:04:27.668 --> 01:04:28.902
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:37.679
Oh! Hollywood Javi. There he is.

01:04:42.282 --> 01:04:44.518
I have some news for you.

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:46.253
Javi Ford coppola.

01:04:46.286 --> 01:04:48.054
Sit.

01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:49.255
Eat with me.

01:05:02.369 --> 01:05:03.903
Froot Loops?

01:05:05.539 --> 01:05:06.574
Delicious.

01:05:08.041 --> 01:05:09.208
Taste it.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.615
I love Froot Loops.

01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:26.326
Sergio baldassari? Huh?

01:05:57.257 --> 01:05:58.257
Hmm.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:10.572
Yeah.

01:06:14.775 --> 01:06:17.545
But I can't do a
deal with the Italians

01:06:18.512 --> 01:06:20.179
if I am being betrayed.

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.054
He flew my wife and daughter

01:06:27.086 --> 01:06:28.131
all the way out to majorca.

01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:29.188
My family!

01:06:29.222 --> 01:06:30.289
Shit!

01:06:30.324 --> 01:06:31.793
No, don't say "shit"!

01:06:31.826 --> 01:06:33.728
You got us into this.
You get us out of this.

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.262
<i>There's no way</i>

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:37.130
we can mobilize
an extraction in time.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:38.699
Then, what am I supposed to do?

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:41.400
If you can get Javi alone,
and then take him out,

01:06:41.434 --> 01:06:43.737
<i>it'll buy the agency time
to get you all out of there.</i>

01:06:43.771 --> 01:06:45.539
Do you have access to a firearm?

01:06:46.773 --> 01:06:48.108
I might.

01:06:48.141 --> 01:06:49.777
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.771
<i>but this is the best way
to safeguard your family.</i>

01:06:56.617 --> 01:06:58.820
Listen, I need you
to be honest with me.

01:06:58.853 --> 01:07:00.119
What the fuck is happening?

01:07:00.152 --> 01:07:01.454
Okay.

01:07:01.487 --> 01:07:03.090
I'm going to tell you something,

01:07:03.123 --> 01:07:04.391
but please don't freak out.

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.061
I'm working for the CIA.

01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:13.811
Are you having a
nervous breakdown?

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:16.402
Probably. But i'm
telling you the truth.

01:07:16.436 --> 01:07:18.516
They wanted some information
on Javi's business dealings

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:20.139
so I've been helping them.

01:07:20.172 --> 01:07:21.619
And the strange thing is,
it does kind of make sense

01:07:21.643 --> 01:07:24.378
given that so much
of acting is like spying.

01:07:24.411 --> 01:07:25.823
Do you have any
idea how this sounds?

01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:28.081
'Cause I mean, it's
not... it's not good.

01:07:28.114 --> 01:07:31.318
Okay, I need an hour to
do one final thing for them

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:32.820
and when I get back,

01:07:32.853 --> 01:07:36.188
the three of us will fly to
Los Angeles together, okay?

01:07:36.222 --> 01:07:38.157
I don't know what to say.

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:40.827
Don't say anything. Just
take addy back to my room.

01:07:40.862 --> 01:07:42.797
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:44.666
I'll be back to get
you. I promise.

01:07:44.699 --> 01:07:45.699
I love you.

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:01.481
Your friend, Nicolas cage,

01:08:01.516 --> 01:08:03.382
the fucking star of Hollywood

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:05.552
is working for the
U.S. government.

01:08:22.368 --> 01:08:23.871
Oh, bullshit!

01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:25.270
Bullshit!

01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:26.541
Bullshit!

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.545
Bullshit!

01:08:30.578 --> 01:08:31.679
Listen.

01:08:34.747 --> 01:08:36.314
<i>I see myself doing more</i>

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.595
<i>of this stuff. You
know, spycraft.</i>

01:08:37.618 --> 01:08:39.819
<i>Subterfuge. What have you.</i>

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.721
<i>I think I might
have a real gift for it.</i>

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:43.823
<i>Good, 'cause we
got another mission for you.</i>

01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:52.832
No.

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:54.332
Lucas, no.

01:09:02.975 --> 01:09:04.176
Lucas.

01:09:17.859 --> 01:09:19.894
No! No, no, no!

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:33.707
I would love to
believe you, <i>primo.</i>

01:09:34.908 --> 01:09:37.645
But either I kill you,

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:40.846
or you kill Nicolas cage.

01:09:46.787 --> 01:09:48.188
Your choice.

01:10:57.524 --> 01:10:58.525
Hi.

01:10:59.493 --> 01:11:00.761
Hey.

01:11:00.795 --> 01:11:03.564
I'm sorry.

01:11:03.597 --> 01:11:06.466
I should have asked you
before bringing them down.

01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:08.903
Yeah.

01:11:08.935 --> 01:11:10.872
And I was thinking

01:11:10.904 --> 01:11:13.640
maybe a kidnapping would work.

01:11:13.673 --> 01:11:16.543
Our movie would start out
as a beautiful character piece

01:11:16.577 --> 01:11:18.880
and then, slowly change
into a more thrilling...

01:11:18.912 --> 01:11:21.047
Hollywood blockbuster.

01:11:21.082 --> 01:11:24.652
Then there's
something for everyone.

01:11:24.685 --> 01:11:26.753
Would you like to
drive out to the cliffs?

01:11:29.055 --> 01:11:31.792
Clear our heads, and
think through the third act?

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.061
Perfect.

01:11:54.047 --> 01:11:55.048
So...

01:11:57.819 --> 01:11:58.853
We should go.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.787
Yeah.

01:12:08.628 --> 01:12:09.831
Are those new shoes?

01:12:09.863 --> 01:12:10.898
These?

01:12:10.931 --> 01:12:12.766
No, I've had these.

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.569
Oh.

01:12:14.601 --> 01:12:16.002
I haven't seen them before.

01:12:16.037 --> 01:12:17.436
I don't wear them very much.

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:18.715
I don't think they're really me.

01:12:18.738 --> 01:12:19.974
What?

01:12:20.006 --> 01:12:22.109
They're great. They
look incredible on you.

01:12:22.143 --> 01:12:24.578
They're totally you. Love 'em.

01:12:24.612 --> 01:12:25.947
Do you wanna try them on?

01:12:25.979 --> 01:12:27.515
I think they would
look amazing on you.

01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:31.118
Oh, wow!

01:12:33.186 --> 01:12:34.855
Those look incredible on you.

01:12:34.889 --> 01:12:36.823
I like how those
look on you. Yeah.

01:12:39.827 --> 01:12:41.394
You wanna trade?

01:12:41.427 --> 01:12:42.429
Like, permanently?

01:12:44.463 --> 01:12:45.465
Okay.

01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:57.110
Cool.

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:04.518
I'm really glad I
got to meet you.

01:13:05.786 --> 01:13:07.822
You're the kind
of friend I could

01:13:09.623 --> 01:13:13.027
not see for years, and
not even really talk to

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:15.427
and just pick up
right where we left off.

01:13:15.462 --> 01:13:16.697
I totally agree.

01:13:17.597 --> 01:13:19.166
It's just...

01:13:19.199 --> 01:13:20.501
Easy.

01:13:33.146 --> 01:13:34.148
Well...

01:13:37.518 --> 01:13:38.819
I guess it's time to figure out

01:13:38.853 --> 01:13:40.121
how this thing ends.

01:13:56.871 --> 01:13:58.872
Nick...

01:13:58.905 --> 01:14:00.875
I meant what I said back there.

01:14:01.809 --> 01:14:02.909
Me, too.

01:14:04.177 --> 01:14:06.079
Which is why this really hurts.

01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:09.783
Javi.

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:12.019
You brought me out
here to kill me, man?

01:14:12.052 --> 01:14:13.119
I'm sorry, Nick.

01:14:13.154 --> 01:14:14.689
So am I.

01:14:14.721 --> 01:14:16.724
'Cause you pull that
trigger and we're both dead.

01:14:16.756 --> 01:14:19.827
Wait. You were gonna kill me?

01:14:19.859 --> 01:14:21.662
And are those my golden guns?

01:14:21.695 --> 01:14:24.265
They're my golden guns.

01:14:24.297 --> 01:14:26.510
And it looks like we both
had a little secret, doesn't it?

01:14:26.533 --> 01:14:27.935
Why the fuck would you kill me?

01:14:27.969 --> 01:14:29.770
You're the head of a
criminal organization.

01:14:29.804 --> 01:14:32.707
My cousin Lucas is the
head of the organization.

01:14:32.739 --> 01:14:34.675
CIA said you ran it.

01:14:34.708 --> 01:14:36.944
The whole world thinks I run it.

01:14:36.978 --> 01:14:39.546
When my father
died, Lucas took over.

01:14:39.579 --> 01:14:41.181
He forced me to
be the figurehead.

01:14:41.215 --> 01:14:42.582
You take his money.

01:14:42.615 --> 01:14:44.851
You don't just leave
this world, Nick.

01:14:44.885 --> 01:14:47.854
You and everyone you care
about is in constant danger.

01:14:47.887 --> 01:14:49.657
Why do you think I
cannot be with Gabriela?

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:52.592
You... you're into Gabriela?

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:53.927
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:55.563
I can't be with Gabriella,

01:14:55.595 --> 01:14:56.840
because that would
put a target on her back.

01:14:56.863 --> 01:14:57.832
Wait, you seriously
didn't realize

01:14:57.864 --> 01:14:58.798
that we liked each other?

01:14:58.832 --> 01:15:00.001
You're in the CIA!

01:15:00.033 --> 01:15:01.301
I'm not in the CIA.

01:15:01.335 --> 01:15:04.738
I'm a goddamn
actor. You know that.

01:15:04.771 --> 01:15:06.172
The only organization
I'm a part of

01:15:06.207 --> 01:15:08.676
is the screen actors
guild of america.

01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:10.220
And aftra. But I don't
even know what that is.

01:15:10.243 --> 01:15:12.189
I think it's a radio thing.
Just put down the gun.

01:15:12.212 --> 01:15:14.081
No way. You go first.

01:15:14.114 --> 01:15:15.692
I'm not going first. You
brought my family out here.

01:15:15.716 --> 01:15:17.327
This is so fucked! I
don't wanna kill you.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:18.853
You're the last
person I wanna kill.

01:15:18.886 --> 01:15:20.854
I fucking love you! I love you!

01:15:26.694 --> 01:15:27.994
It's my cousin.

01:15:28.029 --> 01:15:29.139
He must have known
I wouldn't kill you.

01:15:29.162 --> 01:15:30.597
I thought so.

01:15:30.631 --> 01:15:31.998
Which is why I
should always trust

01:15:32.033 --> 01:15:34.034
my shamanic
instincts as a thespian.

01:15:35.603 --> 01:15:37.738
Fuck!

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:46.212
Faster! I'm trying.

01:15:46.247 --> 01:15:48.149
Your shoes don't
offer any ankle support.

01:15:53.686 --> 01:15:55.189
Ah, fuck!

01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:02.595
Okay. You just run out
there. You get the truck.

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:04.307
You come back and get
me. I will keep a lookout.

01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:07.268
Uh-huh. Love it. Love the plan.

01:16:07.301 --> 01:16:09.036
But given that you've saddled me

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:11.337
with what basically amounts
to fucking penny loafers

01:16:11.372 --> 01:16:13.207
maybe you should
go, and I'll stay here.

01:16:13.239 --> 01:16:14.942
I love that plan, I do.

01:16:14.975 --> 01:16:17.043
But you are a faster
runner than me,

01:16:17.078 --> 01:16:18.746
even with subpar footwear.

01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:20.157
I saw how fast you were
in <i>national treasure.</i>

01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.948
No, that'd be the
stunt department.

01:16:21.981 --> 01:16:23.951
Not according to the
<i>making of</i> featurette.

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:27.755
Fine, I'll go. Wait!

01:16:27.787 --> 01:16:29.689
So, you're gonna
go? I'm going with you.

01:16:39.033 --> 01:16:40.033
There they are!

01:16:53.079 --> 01:16:54.347
Ah, shit!

01:16:57.917 --> 01:16:59.185
He's coming up on us.

01:17:03.756 --> 01:17:04.992
On your left! On your left!

01:17:08.061 --> 01:17:09.697
Holy shit!

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:15.402
Hit the brakes! What?

01:17:15.435 --> 01:17:17.046
Hit the brakes. He will
hit the back of the truck.

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:18.281
That won't work.
Yes, it will. Yes, it will.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:19.773
Just do it. Do it! Do it! Do it!

01:17:24.177 --> 01:17:25.912
Don't worry, he's
totally passed out.

01:17:27.113 --> 01:17:28.815
Fuck!

01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:34.721
I'm okay. Are you okay?

01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:48.801
Liv.

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:50.276
They took addy,
Nick. They took addy?

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:51.915
She went outside to find
you and they just grabbed her.

01:17:51.939 --> 01:17:53.806
There are more soldiers
coming. We have to go.

01:17:54.307 --> 01:17:55.309
Fuck!

01:18:01.448 --> 01:18:03.283
Vivian? Hello.

01:18:03.317 --> 01:18:04.118
<i>Nick, I've sent you the address.</i>

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:05.219
<i>You on the way?</i>

01:18:05.252 --> 01:18:07.121
What? They have my daughter.

01:18:07.154 --> 01:18:08.454
What do they want with her?

01:18:08.488 --> 01:18:09.989
<i>Unfortunately, she's being used</i>

01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:11.792
<i>to put pressure on
the U.S. government</i>

01:18:11.824 --> 01:18:13.403
<i>so they'll back off their
support of delgado.</i>

01:18:13.426 --> 01:18:16.229
<i>And unless delgado
drops out of the election...</i>

01:18:16.262 --> 01:18:17.864
<i>Nick, I'm sorry,</i>

01:18:17.898 --> 01:18:20.067
<i>but they said they're
gonna kill both girls.</i>

01:18:21.068 --> 01:18:22.403
What? What? What?

01:18:22.435 --> 01:18:24.037
You're gonna get
him to drop out, right?

01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:25.506
You're gonna get
him to drop out!

01:18:25.539 --> 01:18:28.007
Just come directly here.

01:19:24.331 --> 01:19:25.832
Oh, fucking...

01:19:29.336 --> 01:19:30.880
His people
could still be in the area.

01:19:30.904 --> 01:19:32.372
We have to go. Where?

01:19:32.405 --> 01:19:34.207
I have a place. Let's go.

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.680
Come, come. Come now.

01:19:38.945 --> 01:19:40.582
So, what's the plan here?

01:19:40.614 --> 01:19:44.318
You gonna be a big
hero? Save addy yourself?

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.487
You'll end up dead like her.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.189
Leave it to the professionals.

01:19:49.222 --> 01:19:51.024
Local police. Whomever.

01:19:51.057 --> 01:19:52.458
There is no one else.

01:19:55.962 --> 01:19:57.297
I love you.

01:19:57.331 --> 01:19:59.332
And I have always
looked out for you.

01:19:59.365 --> 01:20:01.167
Get off of me!

01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:02.569
I have to go in there.

01:20:02.604 --> 01:20:05.104
Because addy has to
know I fought for her.

01:20:07.307 --> 01:20:10.043
I'm trying to help you,
and you won't listen!

01:20:10.077 --> 01:20:11.845
How are you helping me, huh?

01:20:11.878 --> 01:20:13.314
How are you ever helping me?

01:20:15.248 --> 01:20:17.618
You need to know
who you are, Nick.

01:20:17.652 --> 01:20:19.153
This isn't a role.

01:20:19.185 --> 01:20:21.020
You're not a hero.

01:20:21.055 --> 01:20:22.432
<i>You're just some guy
who's about to get us killed.</i>

01:20:22.456 --> 01:20:24.158
<i>You fucking idiot!</i>

01:20:37.572 --> 01:20:39.372
I bought this house 20 years ago

01:20:39.405 --> 01:20:41.609
for a situation just like this.

01:20:41.643 --> 01:20:44.043
It has everything we
need. Food, passports,

01:20:44.078 --> 01:20:45.579
materials for disguise.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.047
We'll be safe for the night.

01:20:52.252 --> 01:20:53.621
Olivia,

01:20:53.654 --> 01:20:55.456
I promise you will get
your daughter back.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.335
The girls are likely being held

01:21:08.368 --> 01:21:09.970
in my cousin's compound.

01:21:10.002 --> 01:21:12.038
It is a monastery that
they use as a cover,

01:21:12.072 --> 01:21:13.574
but it is a fortress.

01:21:13.608 --> 01:21:15.609
It is impenetrable. There
are walls on every side.

01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:16.976
Any escape routes?

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:18.912
Tunnels. But with metal doors

01:21:18.945 --> 01:21:20.515
that only open from the inside.

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:22.024
Even if it weren't for
all of the armed guards,

01:21:22.048 --> 01:21:23.984
it is impossible to get in.

01:21:24.016 --> 01:21:26.386
I mean, this psychopath
is gonna kill our daughter

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.555
in 12 hours.

01:21:27.588 --> 01:21:29.524
So, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

01:21:37.631 --> 01:21:41.100
We are going to walk straight
in through the front gate.

01:21:43.637 --> 01:21:46.073
Okay, cool. Very
dramatic answer.

01:21:46.105 --> 01:21:48.242
How's that supposed to work?

01:21:48.274 --> 01:21:49.352
Lucas is trying
to form an alliance

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:50.677
with Sergio baldassari,

01:21:50.712 --> 01:21:52.546
the head of the
calabero crime family.

01:21:52.579 --> 01:21:55.617
Baldassari, I mean, no one
has seen him for 15 years.

01:21:55.649 --> 01:21:59.485
Exactly. And since
no one has seen him

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.256
no one knows exactly
what he looks like.

01:22:02.288 --> 01:22:03.591
Olivia.

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:04.668
Nick says that you
were an incredible

01:22:04.692 --> 01:22:06.359
makeup artist when you met.

01:22:06.393 --> 01:22:09.395
So, with some prosthetics
and a little makeup...

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:11.364
Then I could play Sergio.

01:22:26.747 --> 01:22:28.314
Lucas Gutierrez!

01:22:33.052 --> 01:22:34.756
I'd like to introduce
my wife Barbara.

01:22:34.788 --> 01:22:38.391
Why for? She was born in
Santa Barbara, California.

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:44.631
You think I'm fucking
stupid, Sergio, hmm?

01:22:44.666 --> 01:22:47.234
You think you're just gonna
walk in here after 15 years

01:22:47.266 --> 01:22:48.703
and kill me,

01:22:48.735 --> 01:22:50.369
you motherfucker, hmm?

01:22:50.404 --> 01:22:51.582
He's cutting my fucking ear off!

01:22:51.605 --> 01:22:53.407
Who are you working
for? Three seconds.

01:22:53.439 --> 01:22:55.208
It's just me! Two!

01:22:55.242 --> 01:22:56.275
I promise!

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.149
You think she can
help you, Sergio, hmm?

01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:06.554
Go ahead.

01:23:06.587 --> 01:23:09.288
You kill him, I'll
still make the deal.

01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:11.024
But I don't think
you're gonna kill him.

01:23:12.726 --> 01:23:14.529
You don't think I'll kill him?

01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:16.039
No, I think if you
were gonna kill him,

01:23:16.063 --> 01:23:17.599
you would have done it by now.

01:23:17.631 --> 01:23:19.332
So, no, I don't
think you'll do it.

01:23:21.536 --> 01:23:23.738
Although, I am wondering

01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:26.372
why the fuck you think
you can intimidate me?

01:23:29.208 --> 01:23:31.110
Okay, Barbara
from Santa Barbara.

01:23:31.144 --> 01:23:32.212
Okay, Barbara.

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.750
It is good to see you, Sergio.

01:23:35.783 --> 01:23:37.283
Been far too long.

01:23:37.317 --> 01:23:38.552
You okay?

01:23:38.586 --> 01:23:40.654
My people will
show you to a room.

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:44.157
Freshen up, and
then, we'll talk.

01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:47.595
God, how does my ear
look? He almost cut off my ear.

01:23:47.628 --> 01:23:49.171
Shit! We've only got
about 15 minutes, Nick.

01:23:49.195 --> 01:23:50.564
We've gotta go find addy.

01:23:50.597 --> 01:23:52.375
I know. I know.
According to Javi's map,

01:23:52.399 --> 01:23:53.801
they're probably holding her

01:23:53.835 --> 01:23:55.515
in the basement of
the building right here.

01:24:05.244 --> 01:24:06.246
You ready?

01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:24.230
What do we do?

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:31.470
Oh, good one.

01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:37.310
Get his gun.

01:24:40.648 --> 01:24:42.349
Drop the gun, Sergio.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.454
Neither of you are
supposed to be here.

01:24:49.422 --> 01:24:50.489
Come with me.

01:24:57.731 --> 01:24:58.733
Lucas.

01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:08.876
A gun?

01:25:08.909 --> 01:25:10.344
Okay, Sergio.

01:25:10.377 --> 01:25:12.279
What's the deal, my man?

01:25:12.311 --> 01:25:13.715
You got a fucking problem

01:25:13.747 --> 01:25:15.917
you'd like to tell
me about or...

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:18.586
I was beginning to think
you don't have the girl

01:25:18.619 --> 01:25:22.724
and since our deal was based
on delgado dropping out...

01:25:22.756 --> 01:25:24.157
- He'll drop out.
- Fuck.

01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:25.492
But he hasn't done it yet.

01:25:25.525 --> 01:25:27.226
Lucas.

01:25:33.701 --> 01:25:35.167
- Lucas!
- Now!

01:25:36.804 --> 01:25:37.805
Okay.

01:25:40.975 --> 01:25:42.777
You know,

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:47.180
if you and I are gonna be
in business together, Sergio,

01:25:47.213 --> 01:25:48.882
you're gonna need to trust me.

01:25:49.516 --> 01:25:50.518
Hmm?

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:57.289
What the fuck?

01:25:57.323 --> 01:25:58.457
What the fuck, what?

01:25:58.492 --> 01:25:59.627
Oh, shit.

01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:01.628
Your face...

01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:04.230
Oh, shit! I'll blow
his fucking head off, man!

01:26:04.264 --> 01:26:06.634
Don't fucking move!

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:07.969
Olivia, take the girls and go.

01:26:08.002 --> 01:26:09.469
What's the plan here, Nick?

01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:11.872
You get the girls
out of here alive!

01:26:11.905 --> 01:26:13.875
No, we can't just
leave him here.

01:26:13.908 --> 01:26:15.375
Addy, go with your mom!

01:26:15.408 --> 01:26:16.443
Hey! Just go. Go!

01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:17.912
Come on.

01:26:17.944 --> 01:26:19.881
Just run, addy.

01:26:21.381 --> 01:26:23.449
You like that? Huh?

01:26:23.483 --> 01:26:24.985
Oh, my god. Nick fucking cage.

01:26:25.019 --> 01:26:26.854
Nick motherfucking cage!

01:26:26.887 --> 01:26:28.722
Don't even think about it!

01:26:32.324 --> 01:26:33.627
Okay, this way. Come on.

01:26:35.295 --> 01:26:36.296
Come on.

01:26:38.966 --> 01:26:40.534
Now, go!

01:26:40.568 --> 01:26:41.836
Wait!

01:26:41.868 --> 01:26:42.904
Where's Nick?

01:26:42.936 --> 01:26:44.971
He's got a gun on Lucas.

01:26:45.006 --> 01:26:46.841
He bought us some
time, but there's others.

01:26:46.873 --> 01:26:48.909
He will never make
it out of there alive.

01:26:53.814 --> 01:26:55.882
Here's what I know, Nick cage.

01:26:55.917 --> 01:27:00.787
I've got four guys with guns
pointed directly at your head.

01:27:00.822 --> 01:27:04.356
Yeah, that's true. But
here's what I know.

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:05.960
My family's safe.

01:27:05.993 --> 01:27:07.194
And that's all that matters.

01:27:10.797 --> 01:27:12.498
Hey!

01:27:12.533 --> 01:27:13.967
There he is.

01:27:14.001 --> 01:27:15.737
There he fucking is!

01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:17.505
The American hero.

01:27:17.904 --> 01:27:19.405
Oh!

01:27:19.439 --> 01:27:22.475
The fucking star
of Hollywood, eh?

01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:26.046
Ooh, whoa. Come
on. What is this?

01:27:26.079 --> 01:27:28.649
And this nose, yeah?

01:27:28.682 --> 01:27:29.984
Don't fucking move!

01:27:30.016 --> 01:27:32.385
Jesus Christ! This
fucking guy again.

01:27:32.418 --> 01:27:33.453
Carlos.

01:27:35.021 --> 01:27:37.057
Carlos, please. You
don't wanna do this to me.

01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:38.760
You don't wanna do this to Javi.

01:27:38.792 --> 01:27:41.561
He's been nothing
but good to you.

01:27:41.595 --> 01:27:42.729
Javi is about to die.

01:27:43.497 --> 01:27:45.465
As are you.

01:27:45.498 --> 01:27:46.967
Shit!

01:27:47.001 --> 01:27:49.537
Anything you'd like
to say before you die?

01:27:51.371 --> 01:27:54.407
"It takes 13 milliseconds
for the human brain"

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.719
"to send a message to the body."

01:27:55.743 --> 01:27:57.744
"So, by the time
your bullets hit me,"

01:27:57.779 --> 01:28:00.680
"my cerebral cortex will
be transmittin' a signal"

01:28:00.715 --> 01:28:02.582
"to the 17 healthy muscles"

01:28:02.617 --> 01:28:05.552
"that operate
my trigger finger."

01:28:05.586 --> 01:28:08.890
"And before your asshole
has a chance to pucker up,"

01:28:08.922 --> 01:28:11.358
"your medulla oblongata
will be splattered"

01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:14.493
"all over the fucking
wall behind ya!"

01:28:14.529 --> 01:28:16.963
"And if that's the last
thing I accomplish"

01:28:16.997 --> 01:28:18.932
"on this beautiful green earth,"

01:28:18.966 --> 01:28:21.903
"well, then, ha, I say, ha..."

01:28:21.935 --> 01:28:24.505
"What a way to fucking go."

01:28:27.574 --> 01:28:28.643
Hey!

01:28:31.578 --> 01:28:33.581
Shit, come on! Nick, go! Go!

01:28:39.086 --> 01:28:40.453
Did we kill him?

01:28:45.626 --> 01:28:47.359
Shit!

01:28:47.394 --> 01:28:49.630
You're dead.

01:28:49.663 --> 01:28:50.997
All of you!

01:29:00.507 --> 01:29:01.943
Nicolas cage?

01:29:04.578 --> 01:29:06.581
That's fucking cool.

01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:13.087
Addy... addy, did
he... did he hurt you?

01:29:13.119 --> 01:29:14.721
Better not have. No.

01:29:14.755 --> 01:29:16.157
Are you hungry? No.

01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:18.826
Javi has apples. You want
a McIntosh? Honeycrisp?

01:29:18.859 --> 01:29:20.426
No apples, Nick.

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:21.427
Dad, just please,
watch the road. Please!

01:29:21.461 --> 01:29:22.729
Oh, shit!

01:29:28.636 --> 01:29:29.970
Oh, shit!

01:29:31.005 --> 01:29:32.006
Oh.

01:29:37.979 --> 01:29:39.790
Olivia, hand me the
guns. They're right in there.

01:29:39.814 --> 01:29:41.047
What are you doing?

01:29:41.748 --> 01:29:43.149
No.

01:29:43.184 --> 01:29:44.460
Okay, stop the truck.
I will slow them down.

01:29:44.484 --> 01:29:45.819
No way! Yes.

01:29:45.853 --> 01:29:47.487
You are two kilometers
from the embassy.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.665
If I slow them down,
then you will all make it.

01:29:48.689 --> 01:29:49.733
- Javi, I can get us there.
- No!

01:29:49.756 --> 01:29:50.917
Just stay in the truck! Javs!

01:29:54.761 --> 01:29:55.796
No!

01:29:55.829 --> 01:29:57.497
Just get in the car, Javi!

01:30:01.101 --> 01:30:02.636
I'm never gonna
have any kind of a life

01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:04.838
unless I stand up to my cousin!

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:07.807
I need this.

01:30:08.975 --> 01:30:10.043
Now, go.

01:30:11.578 --> 01:30:12.579
Go!

01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:22.122
You stayed.

01:30:22.856 --> 01:30:23.990
Of course.

01:31:01.228 --> 01:31:03.596
Don't worry, addy.
Everyone's gonna be okay.

01:31:03.631 --> 01:31:05.065
How's Maria doing? She's okay.

01:31:05.099 --> 01:31:06.266
Dad, please go faster.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.501
Yeah. Take this left here.

01:31:23.617 --> 01:31:24.784
Shit!

01:31:31.993 --> 01:31:34.127
Oh!

01:31:36.863 --> 01:31:38.666
Oh!

01:31:48.341 --> 01:31:51.578
Did we lose 'em?
I think we lost 'em.

01:31:51.612 --> 01:31:53.180
Dad, watch out! Olivia: Oh!

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:01.521
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

01:32:23.778 --> 01:32:26.046
I'm gonna kill you,
Nick fucking cage!

01:32:28.882 --> 01:32:30.618
Get down! Everybody get down!

01:32:35.088 --> 01:32:36.122
Hold on!

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.809
What just happened?

01:32:55.708 --> 01:32:57.144
Addy?

01:32:57.177 --> 01:32:58.345
Come out! Gun!

01:32:58.378 --> 01:32:59.613
Come on!

01:33:04.118 --> 01:33:05.719
Don't you move!

01:33:07.787 --> 01:33:11.125
Get back! Get back!

01:33:11.158 --> 01:33:12.626
Come near me and
I'm gonna kill him.

01:33:12.659 --> 01:33:13.860
Addy?

01:33:16.029 --> 01:33:17.097
Dad!

01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:31.244
We made it, Nick.

01:33:34.814 --> 01:33:36.082
We made it.

01:33:37.818 --> 01:33:38.953
All of us.

01:33:42.122 --> 01:33:43.923
I love you, daddy.

01:34:35.309 --> 01:34:37.444
"I love you, daddy"?

01:34:37.478 --> 01:34:39.113
Javi wrote that. Okay.

01:34:39.913 --> 01:34:41.481
Congratulations.

01:34:41.515 --> 01:34:42.850
Thanks, Olivia.

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:47.453
We're back.

01:34:47.488 --> 01:34:49.088
Not that we went anywhere.

01:34:49.122 --> 01:34:50.390
Not that we went anywhere.

01:35:01.502 --> 01:35:03.103
Thanks. Oh, thanks.

01:35:06.372 --> 01:35:08.042
Nick.

01:35:08.074 --> 01:35:09.475
Javi, I've been looking for you.

01:35:09.511 --> 01:35:11.045
I was wondering where you went.

01:35:11.078 --> 01:35:13.314
Oh, no, I couldn't
watch. I was, uh...

01:35:13.346 --> 01:35:15.216
I was too nervous.

01:35:15.248 --> 01:35:16.417
How did it play?

01:35:16.449 --> 01:35:19.019
They loved it. Congratulations.

01:35:19.052 --> 01:35:20.386
Really? Yeah.

01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:21.921
Oh, wow!

01:35:22.989 --> 01:35:24.324
This is...

01:35:24.358 --> 01:35:25.359
Nick...

01:35:26.226 --> 01:35:27.529
Thank you.

01:35:27.561 --> 01:35:29.963
Javi, we did this
together. Thank you.

01:35:29.997 --> 01:35:31.998
Do you wanna ride
to the party with me?

01:35:32.032 --> 01:35:34.902
They want to interview
us. Uh, <i>vanity fair.</i>

01:35:37.871 --> 01:35:39.974
Yeah, no, I can't
tonight. But you go.

01:35:40.006 --> 01:35:42.376
Have fun. Enjoy this.

01:35:42.408 --> 01:35:44.244
And give Gabriela my love.

01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:51.519
Addy wants to borrow your belt.

01:35:51.552 --> 01:35:53.020
Oh, yeah, I do.

01:35:53.052 --> 01:35:55.055
It looks like it's
got some weight.

01:35:55.088 --> 01:35:57.390
Well, yeah, it's a
big, fat tarantula.

01:35:57.423 --> 01:35:59.059
You know my dresser, Jeff.

01:35:59.092 --> 01:36:00.261
Mr. Neiman Marcus? Yes.

01:36:00.293 --> 01:36:01.929
He wanted me to wear a bee.

01:36:01.962 --> 01:36:03.831
And I said, "Jeff, not
the bees. Not the bees".

01:36:03.863 --> 01:36:05.375
So, he said, "well, how
about a scorpion?" I said,

01:36:05.399 --> 01:36:06.910
"I think a scorpion is a
little aggressive, Jeff."

01:36:06.934 --> 01:36:08.068
"What about a tarantula?"

01:36:08.101 --> 01:36:09.369
He goes, "well, I don't think"

01:36:09.403 --> 01:36:10.581
"that's any less
aggressive, Nick."

01:36:10.604 --> 01:36:11.845
And I say, "well, it is to me."

01:36:11.872 --> 01:36:12.916
They're cute and fuzzy, right?

01:36:12.939 --> 01:36:14.050
Well, addy wants to borrow it.

01:36:14.073 --> 01:36:15.577
Not at all.

01:36:15.609 --> 01:36:17.344
You can have it. It's yours.

01:36:17.377 --> 01:36:19.880
Are you sure you didn't
need to stay at the premiere?

01:36:19.912 --> 01:36:21.981
Hundred percent. Yeah?

01:36:22.015 --> 01:36:23.158
Who chose Demi
Moore to play mom?

01:36:23.182 --> 01:36:24.952
Studio.

01:36:24.984 --> 01:36:27.220
But it doesn't really do
your mother justice, does it?

01:36:27.253 --> 01:36:28.421
Oh, come on.

01:36:28.454 --> 01:36:29.556
She's gorgeous.

01:36:29.591 --> 01:36:30.957
So are you, Olivia.

01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:33.226
Ew, dad, stop hitting on mom.

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:34.927
I'm not hitting on her.

01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:37.363
Oh, gross. I don't wanna
listen to this anymore.

01:36:37.398 --> 01:36:39.432
You know what? What do
you say we watch a movie?

01:36:39.466 --> 01:36:41.435
Yeah, whatever you want, dad.

01:36:41.467 --> 01:36:42.935
No, really. You choose.

01:36:44.238 --> 01:36:45.471
Really?

01:36:45.506 --> 01:36:47.509
Yeah, show us
something you like.

01:36:47.542 --> 01:36:49.143
This is...

01:36:49.176 --> 01:36:51.345
Have you ever seen <i>Paddington 2?</i>

01:37:37.625 --> 01:37:39.059
<i>You're Nick</i>

01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:41.362
<i>fucking...</i>

01:37:47.601 --> 01:37:49.403
<i>Whoa! Cage!</i>
