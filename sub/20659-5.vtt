{\an1}Why are we working
on this so hard?

01:09.402 --> 01:11.112
- Because our boss is coming.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.824
Guys, this is our chance
to get promotions and move on.

But you know what I'm saying.
Come on, guys.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.417

all: Oh, busy's good.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.190
- You gotta stay busy.
- Busy's good.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.567
{\an3}- Of course,
compared to Chet,

02:30.650 --> 02:32.068
I'm basically doing nothing.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.736
- Oh, that's right.
What is this I hear

02:33.820 --> 02:36.698
about them building a statue
of you in a Chinese village?

02:36.781 --> 02:38.199
- It's actually
in northern Laos.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.868
I mean, all I did was go over
there and open

02:39.951 --> 02:41.411
a couple of button factories
with my dad

02:41.494 --> 02:43.329
and now they call me
"fu sen yai."

02:43.413 --> 02:44.706
The savior.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.374

What about you, Jeff?

02:49.335 --> 02:52.547

- Uh, have you heard of

02:52.630 --> 02:54.299
Smoothie Prince?
- Wow!

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
That's your company?

02:55.967 --> 02:58.595
{\an3}- No, no, no.
I--I just sell them.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.264
{\an1}- Oh, so you're the head
of the marketing department.

03:01.347 --> 03:04.267
Hey, still a great gig.
- No, no, I, uh--

03:04.350 --> 03:06.394
I sell them at the mall.

03:06.477 --> 03:07.812
It's so cool.
I can drink

03:07.896 --> 03:09.230
all the free smoothies I want.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.026
Just don't tell my boss.
[laughs]

03:13.109 --> 03:14.277
- Cool.
- Yes.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.112
{\an3}- "Busy's good"?

03:16.195 --> 03:17.906
{\an3}Next time,

03:17.989 --> 03:20.116

03:20.199 --> 03:22.118

03:22.869 --> 03:24.829
They're just being ambitious.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.081
{\an1}I mean, don't you have
any goals for your life?

03:27.165 --> 03:28.750
- Of course I do.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.960
{\an3}I want you to be
my girlfriend again.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.587
{\an1}- I don't know
if you remember this,

03:32.670 --> 03:33.588
but when we were together,

03:33.671 --> 03:34.631
all we did was sit on the couch

03:34.714 --> 03:35.924
and get high all day.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.800
- I know.
Wasn't it amazing?

03:37.884 --> 03:41.095
{\an1}- Yeah, it was fun when we were
kids in our early 20s.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.014
But we're in our mid-20s now.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.099
{\an1}I need to be with somebody
who's mature

03:45.183 --> 03:47.268
{\an1}and pushing himself
to do big things.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.103
{\an3}- Big things?
I can do big things.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.813
But, like, how big?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.649
Are we talking, like,
go to medical school

03:52.732 --> 03:54.317
{\an3}or, like, you know,
smoke a little less weed?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.819
{\an3}Wh-what are
the parameters here?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.821
{\an3}You know what?
Don't worry about it.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.697
I'll figure it out.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.159
{\an3}- Can I have
a blueberry blitz, please?

04:03.242 --> 04:04.202
{\an1}- Absolutely, sir.
Are you interested in

04:04.285 --> 04:06.788
a free protein boost today?

04:06.871 --> 04:08.498
{\an3}- Uh, sure.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.541
{\an1}- Luke, he said yes!
He said yes!

04:10.625 --> 04:12.168

- Okay, okay.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.503
- Okay, quick, quick, quick.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.171
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't play

04:15.254 --> 04:17.673

04:20.927 --> 04:21.844

04:21.928 --> 04:23.304
This is your favorite game ever.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.515
- Yeah, dude.
- You said, and I quote,

04:25.598 --> 04:28.309
{\an1}"Watching a customer
unknowingly drink my [bleep]

04:28.393 --> 04:29.894

04:29.978 --> 04:31.354
Beautiful quote.
- Hey, you know what?

04:31.437 --> 04:33.147
I think I'm gonna
go somewhere else.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.858
- Okay, well, I don't
say things like that anymore.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.152
