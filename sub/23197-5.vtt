WEBVTT

00:06.245 --> 00:07.800
This is outrageous!

00:08.090 --> 00:10.145
We're the best twin gamers in the world.

00:10.855 --> 00:13.276
Did you not see us 
at the Twin Cyber Olympics?

00:13.676 --> 00:14.490
Nah, I did.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.059
The answer's still no.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.169
Mom, checkbook.

00:19.579 --> 00:20.748
And Mr. Calhoun,

00:21.248 --> 00:25.406
I'm sure that a dirty old poor person 
like you making 30 grand a year

00:25.406 --> 00:31.609
could benefit from a little, 
I don't know, check for $900,000?

00:36.968 --> 00:37.906
(ripping)

00:37.906 --> 00:38.850
(gasps)

00:41.613 --> 00:43.631
You're right, mom.
They <i>are</i> bad with money.

00:44.851 --> 00:47.551
At first you weren't getting in
because you're 12

00:47.551 --> 00:48.865
and this is a high school,

00:49.635 --> 00:53.705
but now you're never getting in
'cause you're terrible people.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.667
Terrible? (giggles)

00:55.947 --> 00:59.311
If we're so terrible,
how come we get everything we want?

00:59.311 --> 01:01.427
Exactly what a terrible person would say.

01:01.807 --> 01:02.857
Please leave.

01:02.927 --> 01:05.027
(scoffs) Fine, wanna play hardball?

01:05.387 --> 01:07.682
Mom, buy his school for us.

01:07.682 --> 01:10.518
(Mom) Now, boys, I just bought
you an energy drink company to run.

01:10.518 --> 01:11.835
(both) But mom!

01:11.885 --> 01:12.910
(mom) Tell you what.

01:12.910 --> 01:16.970
Get your stock up to $400 a share
and maybe we'll buy you VGHS.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.291
You hear that, Calhoun?

01:18.491 --> 01:20.881
- Hostile takeover.
- We're gonna buy your dumb school

01:20.881 --> 01:22.168
and throw you out on the street!

01:22.168 --> 01:24.111
You'll rue the day you 
ever said no to Ashton--

01:24.111 --> 01:25.395
And Shane...

01:25.395 --> 01:26.764
(both) Barnstormer!

02:07.244 --> 02:10.270
Move over Napalm, 
'cause Jock Juice has come to town!

02:10.483 --> 02:11.985
This is where your money belongs.

02:12.209 --> 02:14.402
Teenagers are clapping 
hard for Jock Juice.

02:14.472 --> 02:17.525
Well, my win, as with all my wins,
can be attributed

02:17.775 --> 02:20.741
solely to this delicious 
beverage, Jock Juice.

02:20.921 --> 02:22.834
Juice up your jocks with Jock Juice!

02:23.004 --> 02:25.511
Slam it into your underpants 
and feel the surge.

02:25.811 --> 02:26.953
(sipping)

02:28.093 --> 02:29.806
Jock Juice, uh!

02:30.606 --> 02:33.127
Uh...uhhh...

02:33.127 --> 02:35.070
Okay, it's good.
It's good, it's a good beverage.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.955
(school bell rings)

03:26.446 --> 03:27.300
Next.

03:33.794 --> 03:34.571
Name?

03:34.765 --> 03:35.618
Shane.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.211
Shane Pizza.

03:40.424 --> 03:41.530
(bell clatters)

03:41.530 --> 03:42.821
Whoo, lemme hear it ring!

03:42.821 --> 03:45.323
Cool tattoo, nice shoes, up top!

03:46.883 --> 03:48.123

need anything, okay?

04:37.958 --> 04:38.835
Yes, sir.

04:38.835 --> 04:41.136
Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Swan for everything.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.894
Especially Overdrift Rally Rash!

04:43.894 --> 04:45.463
- (laughter)
- You guys are tops.

04:50.603 --> 04:52.678
Sweetie, you take care.
I'm gonna miss you.

04:53.228 --> 04:54.145
Of course.

04:54.945 --> 04:55.961
Goodbye, parents.

05:04.111 --> 05:07.981
All right! The boys 
and Ki are back in town.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.831
Watch out, VGHS.
We're comin' for ya!

05:14.196 --> 05:15.271
Aw, come on, Ki.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.273
The election was, like, forever ago.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.853
No one's gonna remember who you are.

05:19.283 --> 05:22.454
And Brian, dude, come on.

05:22.924 --> 05:25.535
You and Jenny, come on!

05:25.935 --> 05:26.984
Dude!

05:26.984 --> 05:30.085
I know, I know, you're right.
I just...I don't know.

05:30.085 --> 05:33.574
I think I know what I gotta say to her,
and I'm nervous.

05:33.574 --> 05:35.127
I hope she takes me back.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.481
Did this school get bigger,
or did we get smaller?

05:44.587 --> 05:47.751
(chuckles) Looks like 
the same old VGHS to me.

05:53.596 --> 05:56.588
Give it up for The Silver 
Sun Pickups, everybody.

05:58.013 --> 06:00.181
That's why we come 
to school on a Sunday, people.

06:01.211 --> 06:03.388
Now, on to morning announcements.

06:03.808 --> 06:04.893
Good news.

06:05.143 --> 06:07.902
I noticed that the student fund
was getting a little low,

06:08.192 --> 06:14.547
so I dug into my big ol' Pizza pockets
and got some...drum roll please.

06:14.663 --> 06:17.358
(drum roll)

06:17.888 --> 06:20.352
New computers for the social gamers!

06:20.352 --> 06:21.598
Come on down, you guys.

06:21.598 --> 06:22.908
(cheering)

06:24.608 --> 06:27.437
Oh, man.
Don't they look happy?

06:27.437 --> 06:30.538
(cheering)

06:31.658 --> 06:33.488
(Shane) Now, I didn't have to do that.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.027
But I did.

06:35.777 --> 06:37.989
Because we're all one big family.

06:38.849 --> 06:43.700
You are my family.
You are mine!

06:43.700 --> 06:45.838
You my mine, VGHS!

06:45.838 --> 06:47.918
(cheering)

06:49.968 --> 06:53.172
That's hucking those omelettes, gangs.
Smash Mouth is up next.

06:53.172 --> 06:55.004
(cheering)

06:55.734 --> 06:56.559
What?

06:57.709 --> 07:01.481
(girl) Oh, here she comes.
Way to go, Heather.

07:01.561 --> 07:03.278
(gasps) God!

07:18.348 --> 07:20.029
God! No!
What? No running!

07:20.171 --> 07:21.441
Please, no throwing stuff!

07:21.441 --> 07:23.609
I-huh-hey!
Hey, Ki!

07:24.029 --> 07:25.193
- You're back.
- Yes.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.146
- I see they've made you RA.
- Yeah, well, once you left

07:28.146 --> 07:30.645
nobody wanted to take the job,
so I thought, "I'll do it!"

07:30.755 --> 07:32.520
Hey, hey.

07:33.030 --> 07:36.260
Anywhos, so it's been really tough,
but you're back, so that's great.

07:38.450 --> 07:42.941
Um...so...speaking of which,
you have bathroom duty today.

07:48.431 --> 07:51.290
Uh, the girls, they say it's clean,
but they know I won't go in there,

07:51.290 --> 07:53.170
so I think they're lying. (chuckles)

07:53.170 --> 07:55.481
Will you-will you get that 
done by tomorrow, please?

07:56.401 --> 07:57.193
(Ki) Nope.

07:58.222 --> 08:00.151
Oh, come on!
Not you too, Ki.

08:00.151 --> 08:03.450
Why does nobody listen to me?! (whines)

08:06.870 --> 08:08.318
It's because you're weak, Wendell.

08:09.541 --> 08:12.857
- And the world preys on the weak.
- Guh!

08:12.857 --> 08:14.707
God, what's wrong with you?

08:14.707 --> 08:17.282
I thought helping 
people was your thing.

08:18.032 --> 08:19.273
I have a new thing now.

08:19.813 --> 08:20.505
What?!

08:22.388 --> 08:24.433
(Wendell) You're getting 
a frownie sticker, Ki!

08:29.263 --> 08:31.184
Go ahead.
I don't care.

08:31.787 --> 08:33.778
Like crap you don't, Ki Swan!

08:33.928 --> 08:35.886
You invented the sticker system, okay?

08:35.886 --> 08:38.765
You're the only one who cares 
about it and if you don't clean

08:38.765 --> 08:42.022
the bathroom in 24 hours,
your name is getting a frownie sticker!

08:43.292 --> 08:44.711
(Wendell) 24 hours, Ki!

08:46.001 --> 08:47.306
(vrooming)

08:47.306 --> 08:48.701
Brake! (imitates squealing wheels)

08:48.701 --> 08:51.687
What up, Drift people!
Who's ready to get their rally on...?

08:57.944 --> 08:58.914
(DK) Theodore!

08:59.562 --> 09:00.652
Old friend!

09:01.767 --> 09:03.953
You find us at our darkest hour.

09:03.953 --> 09:05.567
Sorry about that whole "dad" thing.

09:07.087 --> 09:08.115
We got you a basket.

09:08.965 --> 09:12.677
Oh, thanks.
What happened to your head?

09:13.597 --> 09:16.976
The Dutchess of Fart and her 
Fart Goons shaved it in my sleep!

09:17.086 --> 09:18.413
What?! Why?

09:18.413 --> 09:21.932
She thinks that if I have no hair
I won't want that coupon for that perm.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.573
They've been pranking us all week.
I think it's time we strike back.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.646
Hide this in your pants.

09:28.996 --> 09:31.592
I was really hoping we could play.

09:31.592 --> 09:34.843
Oh, play later.
First...to war!

09:35.523 --> 09:40.014
(heroic music)

09:40.581 --> 09:41.776
Aw, man!

09:44.980 --> 09:47.552
(explosions)

09:47.552 --> 09:51.030
(gunfire)

09:56.348 --> 09:58.943
Lieutenant, start the engine!

09:59.113 --> 10:03.565
Sir, I can't solve this equation!
Do you know the variable?

10:04.135 --> 10:06.823
I don't.
But maybe you do.

10:09.453 --> 10:13.406
Okay, gang, master chief 
can't fix his warthog

10:13.406 --> 10:15.608
until we find the correct equation.

10:17.508 --> 10:18.473
Anyone?

10:20.721 --> 10:25.230
Uh, is the equation Jenny - 
Brian = "Can I get a taste?"

10:25.230 --> 10:26.429
(laughter)

10:26.429 --> 10:27.620
Get out, Sebastian.

10:28.660 --> 10:30.494
- Worth a shot.
- (teacher) Out!

10:31.304 --> 10:34.012
- It's X - 2.
- (chuckling)

10:34.392 --> 10:35.522
I'm also smart.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.422
(sighs)

10:39.615 --> 10:41.058
Jenny, show us how it's done.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.452
(sighs)

10:51.995 --> 10:53.793
(explosion)

10:54.373 --> 10:56.304
(laughter)

10:56.304 --> 10:57.796
Nice going, <i>craptain</i>.

10:58.456 --> 10:59.722
Can't even hit a variable.

11:00.862 --> 11:02.117
(students "ooh")

11:02.117 --> 11:04.129
Keep missing, Jenny.
It's still funny.

11:04.759 --> 11:06.056
Okay, that's enough.

11:06.056 --> 11:08.234
Yeah, so, I'm ditching.

11:08.824 --> 11:09.641
Peace.

11:10.010 --> 11:11.572
Don't miss the door on your way out!

11:12.032 --> 11:13.971
Ooh!

11:22.980 --> 11:24.940
Oh, hey, Rosie.
I'm taking my break.

11:25.204 --> 11:26.347
Go get her, kid.

11:32.511 --> 11:34.901
Hey, J-Jenny.
What's up, stranger?

11:34.991 --> 11:36.285
Brian, you're back.

11:36.425 --> 11:38.616
Yeah, just hangin' out.

11:39.286 --> 11:40.638
Well, what're you up to?

11:40.948 --> 11:42.293
Just ditching class.

11:42.973 --> 11:45.461
Uh-oh...cool, that's new for you.

11:45.461 --> 11:48.337
Yeah, so is being dumped 
and made fun of by the entire school.

11:50.147 --> 11:51.785
- Oh.
- Did you need something?

11:52.335 --> 11:53.991
Uh, yeah.

11:56.271 --> 11:57.988
I had a whole game plan, but...

11:58.518 --> 12:00.713
but you just said...
I kinda gotta change it.

12:02.073 --> 12:03.717
Um, listen.

12:04.817 --> 12:07.910
I've had some time 
to think about it and I'm sorry.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.888
Okay, no. (sighs)
I'm sorry.

12:13.888 --> 12:16.570
I just think that we should talk about us.

12:16.570 --> 12:19.433
Brian, I don't even know what I 
would say to you about "us" right now.

12:19.455 --> 12:23.250
Uh, well for starters I was hoping 
there could even be an us...

12:23.250 --> 12:24.438
and you're leaving.

12:31.797 --> 12:34.207
Um, so, what're we doing again?

12:34.207 --> 12:35.394
Goddamn it, Ted!

12:35.394 --> 12:37.303
How many times do we 
have to explain this?

12:38.595 --> 12:41.085
The Duchess and I won 
the Trivia Bowl last week,

12:41.085 --> 12:44.463
and the first place prize was one coupon 
for a highlight and perm

12:44.463 --> 12:46.583
at the Beyond Two Souls Beauty Salon.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.669
(chains rattle)

12:47.669 --> 12:48.933
I thought I deserved it.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.216
She thought differently.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.723
We quarreled and Calhoun 
took the coupon away.

12:55.093 --> 12:57.528
He won't give it back until 
we decide on who gets it.

12:58.318 --> 12:59.780
That's when the pranks began.

13:01.650 --> 13:05.158
Um, okay.
So what do you want me to do?

13:09.918 --> 13:11.143
Shoot her in the head.

13:11.143 --> 13:12.695
Ew! Gum in the hair?

13:12.695 --> 13:15.599
Dude, that's way gross and mean.

13:16.019 --> 13:19.874
We tried to take the high road,
but look what she's done to us.

13:19.874 --> 13:22.170
Everything smells like super glue.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.940
What would you have us do, Ted?
Lie down and die?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.785
- Well, no, but--
- Come on, dude.

13:27.785 --> 13:30.099
You're the John Wilkes Booth 
of sling shots.

13:30.099 --> 13:31.587
He's the guy that killed Lincoln.

13:31.847 --> 13:32.887
You got this.

13:32.887 --> 13:35.672
(sighs) Fine, okay, I'll do it.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.429
Well, that's what friends are for, right?

13:37.769 --> 13:39.064
That's the spirit, Ted!

13:40.064 --> 13:40.961
Let's roll.

13:41.381 --> 13:45.946
(heroic music)

13:57.022 --> 13:58.965
Oh, already hard at work, I see. Huh?

13:58.965 --> 14:01.653
If you need more bleach, 
there's...okay, what?

14:01.653 --> 14:03.537
What the heck is that?

14:03.537 --> 14:04.674
Oh, didn't you hear?

14:04.674 --> 14:07.044
I'm hosting a 24 hour 
game design competition.

14:08.154 --> 14:09.397
So much for bathroom duty.

14:09.737 --> 14:12.271
Oh, nice try, Ki!
But if you want to host

14:12.271 --> 14:13.778
a school event, you're gonna need--

14:13.778 --> 14:16.010
Waivers, signed in triplicate by Calhoun.

14:16.330 --> 14:19.923
Okay...um...fine, fine.

14:19.923 --> 14:22.153
Once you're done, just go 
clean the bathroom, okay?

14:22.153 --> 14:24.646
In 24 hours it will be Zoe's turn 
to clean the bathroom.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.640
So...I win.

14:28.180 --> 14:28.935
(typing)

14:28.935 --> 14:30.223
What?

14:30.463 --> 14:34.277
This-This isn't you, Ki!
Why are you being such a jerk?

14:34.277 --> 14:35.806
Because life is meaningless.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.864
- Huh.
- (typing)

14:41.394 --> 14:44.266
I have a game to design,
so if you could just please leave.

14:44.346 --> 14:46.729
Or stay and design a game.
It's a game jam.

14:48.589 --> 14:49.910
(groans)

14:53.630 --> 14:58.144
(sirens wail)

14:58.144 --> 14:59.624
(gunfire)

15:06.051 --> 15:08.116
<i>Sushi_Princess wins.</i>

15:08.596 --> 15:11.776
(man) GTFO, Jenny! 
You suck! (laughs)

15:11.776 --> 15:13.701
You wanna come say that to my face?!

15:14.301 --> 15:15.772
Oh, that's what I thought.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.866
(girl) So, it really is you.

15:24.026 --> 15:24.887
Who's asking?

15:25.237 --> 15:28.396
The number one player 
in that game you just sucked at.

15:30.336 --> 15:31.745
You're Sushi_Princess?

15:31.875 --> 15:34.790
What happened to you, Matrix?
You used to be my hero.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.233
You used to be the best.

15:36.233 --> 15:38.838
Then Brian gave you cooties 
and you've sucked ever since.

15:39.318 --> 15:40.640
Okay, well, that is not fair.

15:40.640 --> 15:41.619
- (spits)
- (gasps)

15:41.619 --> 15:43.409
Life ain't fair!
Grow a pair.

15:43.669 --> 15:44.923
Sushi_Princess.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.871
I really like that kid.

15:51.271 --> 15:53.205
(sarcastically) Yay, mom's here.

15:53.315 --> 15:56.754
Come on, let's get a burger.
Pity party's over.

16:05.328 --> 16:07.074
I've lost her forever, old buddy.

16:12.349 --> 16:24.056
♪ Ooh ♪

16:25.436 --> 16:33.541
♪ Ooh ♪

16:38.307 --> 16:39.658
(ominous music)

16:39.658 --> 16:43.027

16:54.971 --> 16:58.621
(tribal wailing)

17:03.097 --> 17:10.306
(tribal drumming)

17:52.004 --> 17:53.468
Go, crap!
They made us!

17:53.708 --> 17:55.048
Wha-whoa-whoa! (grunts)

17:55.048 --> 17:56.155
Good job, Ted.

17:56.675 --> 17:58.095
Oh, my tail bone!

17:58.095 --> 17:59.456
(Duchess) Well, well, well.

17:59.456 --> 18:01.445
His majesty's loyal lap dog.

18:01.445 --> 18:03.518
Duchess, I'm really sorry
about your hair.

18:06.658 --> 18:07.911
Oh, uh...

18:08.061 --> 18:09.652
Well, in that case I guess 
we're even, huh?

18:09.712 --> 18:11.578
So truce peace?
Oh, please, Duchess, please!

18:11.578 --> 18:14.028
Please, please, I just back to school.
All I want is to play video games.

18:16.378 --> 18:19.000
Oh, Ted.
You're right.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.944
You've had a tough week.

18:23.864 --> 18:26.508
- Oh, that was very nice of you.
- Calhoun!

18:26.948 --> 18:28.271
- Ted did it.
- Wha-?

18:31.571 --> 18:32.617
TED!

18:34.707 --> 18:36.546
- (school bell rings)
- Detention for the rest of the day.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.108
Calhoun, I swear it wasn't me.

18:38.119 --> 18:41.691
Ted, I'm a grown man
with gum in my hair!

18:41.901 --> 18:44.679
Someone's going down.
That someone is you.

18:44.679 --> 18:45.871
- But--
- Spare me.

18:45.871 --> 18:48.372
You and the Drifters have been 
pulling this crap all year.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.458
(sighs) Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

18:55.048 --> 18:58.060
Look, I know it's tough,
what's happened with your dad.

18:58.750 --> 19:01.500
And being a teen is hard, I guess.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.119
But, dammit, grow up!

19:07.164 --> 19:09.979
(fire alarm rings)

19:09.979 --> 19:12.255
This school better be on fire.

19:13.145 --> 19:14.145
Don't move.

19:17.955 --> 19:19.473
Well, what if it is on fire?

19:20.113 --> 19:24.414
(phone rings)

19:25.334 --> 19:27.050
Uh, Calhoun's office.

19:27.050 --> 19:28.914
<i>Ted, this is DK.</i>
<i>Get the coupon.</i>

19:28.914 --> 19:30.487
<i>Bottom left drawer. Go!</i>

19:30.487 --> 19:34.383
- DK, I just got super in trouble!
- <i>Get that coupon!</i>

19:34.383 --> 19:36.271
- (hangs up)
- GOD!

19:37.521 --> 19:38.484
BAH!

19:40.099 --> 19:43.736
Ki Swan!

19:44.716 --> 19:47.470
How do you make, um, video games?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.486
First rule: no talking.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.231
Second rule: sit over there.

19:55.340 --> 19:56.223
Okay.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.587
Hello, knock, knock, knock!

20:00.587 --> 20:01.729
Ding dong!
Hello?

20:01.729 --> 20:02.669
(chuckles)

20:02.669 --> 20:04.509
(sighs) What is this?
What're you doing?

20:04.579 --> 20:07.750
Well, as Head RA, it is my duty
to help students in need.

20:07.950 --> 20:10.882
And, Miss Swan, you need 
to talk about your feels.

20:10.882 --> 20:11.961
Hmm?

20:11.961 --> 20:14.577
So I'm not going to leave
here until you do.

20:14.657 --> 20:16.549
I'm an artist.
I don't talk.

20:17.269 --> 20:18.194
I create.

20:19.294 --> 20:20.340
Hey, what is this?

20:23.200 --> 20:24.371
<i>(owls hoot)</i>

20:25.301 --> 20:27.184
Huh. Hey, this is kinda cool.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.076
How do you jump?

20:37.886 --> 20:39.635
- You can leave now.
- What, that's it?

20:39.967 --> 20:42.295
You just walk until you let go 
and then you die?

20:42.295 --> 20:43.648
Yep, that's the whole game.

20:43.648 --> 20:46.616
But that's stupid!
What's the point of playing?

20:46.986 --> 20:47.991
Exactly.

20:48.181 --> 20:51.031
Oh my god, Ki!
Please be more pretentious.

20:51.031 --> 20:53.220
It's not pretentious, Wendell.
You're just too dumb to get it.

20:53.220 --> 20:56.879
(mumbling) That's right, Wendell.
You're dumb.

20:58.129 --> 21:01.801
(scoffs) Well then, I guess 
dumb old Wendell will just have

21:01.801 --> 21:04.192
to play your dumb old game 
until he figures it out.

21:04.802 --> 21:06.783
(Ki) There's nothing 
to figure out, Wendell.

21:06.783 --> 21:10.607
Well, then it's gonna be 
a loooong 21 hours, Ki.

21:11.507 --> 21:13.483
- I'm outta here.
- (Wendell) Bye.

21:21.873 --> 21:22.944
How about some music?

21:24.640 --> 21:28.435
<i>(DJ) You're listening to NPR,</i>
<i>the Napalm Player Report,</i>

21:28.435 --> 21:30.370
<i>and we're talking with Ashley Barnstormer.</i>

21:32.800 --> 21:34.079
Great timing, mom.

21:36.209 --> 21:38.679
Speaking of timing, I was gonna 
tell you this after class

21:38.679 --> 21:41.354
but the commandos need me 
back earlier than I thought.

21:43.224 --> 21:44.311
When do you leave?

21:44.841 --> 21:46.929
The OTA's are Monday, so tomorrow.

21:49.119 --> 21:51.078
Wow, that's great.

21:51.078 --> 21:53.305
Yeah, the new owners 
have to flex their muscles.

21:53.565 --> 21:56.572
- And since school is wrapping up--
- Mom, it's fine.

21:56.572 --> 21:58.465
You know, you gotta go.
I get it.

21:59.165 --> 21:59.881
Have fun.

22:09.282 --> 22:10.452
Why are you touching me?

22:11.132 --> 22:12.508
I'm...comforting you?

22:13.088 --> 22:14.187
Is that a question?

22:14.977 --> 22:17.342
You know, I'm trying to be a mom here.

22:17.342 --> 22:19.594
Yeah? Well, you're terrible at it.

22:19.594 --> 22:21.730
Yeah? Well...(stammers)

22:21.730 --> 22:23.360
Your boyfriend dumped you.

22:23.360 --> 22:27.619
(laughs) You know, 
I don't even know why we try.

22:28.559 --> 22:29.432
Wow.

22:29.432 --> 22:30.636
- No!
- Yup.

22:32.596 --> 22:34.921
Jenny! Wait!
Come back here.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.041
Jenny!
Get back here!

22:37.041 --> 22:38.350
Stop! Stop!

22:38.983 --> 22:39.999
(shrieks)

22:40.829 --> 22:42.458
- What?!
- You weren't stopping.

22:43.498 --> 22:45.507
Okay, mom.
Here's your chance.

22:45.507 --> 22:47.578
- Parent me.
- Oh, shit.

22:48.008 --> 22:48.977
I don't know.

22:51.517 --> 22:53.717
Listen, you don't need me here, okay?

22:54.327 --> 22:56.540
You're one of the best 
in the league and next year--

22:56.540 --> 22:58.871
Mom, I know, okay?
This isn't even about you.

22:59.281 --> 23:00.627
Oh, thank god.
Wait.

23:01.767 --> 23:03.525
- Then what's the problem?
- (sighs)

23:03.945 --> 23:08.097
The problem is everything else!

23:09.177 --> 23:12.409
All right? I am an angry, unhappy person.

23:12.409 --> 23:15.106
That's probably why I 
punched Ashley in the face,

23:15.106 --> 23:18.975
and why I have no real friends,
and why I just ruined

23:18.975 --> 23:23.046
my relationship with the only person
in my life who's ever really loved me.

23:25.886 --> 23:29.881
Present company sort of excluded, 
I guess, and dad, or...

23:30.711 --> 23:31.486
(groans)

23:35.426 --> 23:36.140
(sighs)

23:36.480 --> 23:39.036
(train whistles)

23:49.549 --> 23:51.221
Brian wants to get back together.

23:53.236 --> 23:58.393
Which means that he hasn't realized 
that I'm a total sociopath

23:58.393 --> 24:00.956
that cares more about 
video games than people.

24:03.496 --> 24:05.606
When he does, he's gonna 
wanna break up again,

24:05.606 --> 24:10.995
which is exactly what I deserve,
'cause I'm a shitty person.

24:14.805 --> 24:16.144
You're not a shitty person.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.660
How would you know that?

24:20.540 --> 24:23.461
A shitty person is a mom 
that walks out on her husband

24:23.461 --> 24:26.709
and her little girl just to get 
another trophy under her belt.

24:29.879 --> 24:32.606
Not a 16 year old girl
with hopes and dreams.

24:36.956 --> 24:40.399
Just the fact that you even care 
about other people's feelings,

24:40.399 --> 24:43.679
that makes you, you know, fine.

24:46.499 --> 24:51.219
(touching music)

24:54.233 --> 24:55.473
I'm gonna miss you, kid.

24:57.723 --> 24:58.801
Me too.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.422
(sighs)

25:14.159 --> 25:16.052
(breathes heavily)

25:20.168 --> 25:22.165
(breathes heavily)

25:25.411 --> 25:26.306
(breathes heavily)

25:26.306 --> 25:28.369
Stop, stop that.
Stop doing that.

25:29.719 --> 25:30.647
Sorry.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.314
Just Brian messing up again like always.

25:34.794 --> 25:37.966
Okay, what is it?
Spit it out.

25:39.216 --> 25:40.117
(sighs)

25:41.607 --> 25:45.435
It's just when Jenny and I broke up.
And I wanna fix it.

25:45.755 --> 25:47.456
Or, I don't know,
maybe I don't.

25:47.456 --> 25:50.526
Maybe I'm meant to be alone. (sighs)

25:51.826 --> 25:53.009
I don't wanna die.

25:53.949 --> 25:56.678
Calhoun, please.
I don't have a dad.

25:57.378 --> 25:59.642
I just danced with my cat.
I need an adult.

26:01.302 --> 26:04.316
- (sighs) Do you like her?
- Yes.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.757
Are you in high school?

26:07.087 --> 26:07.845
(puzzled) Yes.

26:08.335 --> 26:12.832
Welcome to the wonderful world 
of having no problems!

26:12.832 --> 26:13.865
No, no!

26:13.865 --> 26:15.140
Calhoun, the problem is...

26:16.220 --> 26:17.620
even if we get back together...

26:20.130 --> 26:21.150
I don't know.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.088
I'm never gonna be the most 
important thing in her life.

26:25.118 --> 26:29.026
Yeah, that's 'cause she's smarter 
than most teenage girls, all right?

26:29.706 --> 26:31.274
You're her high school boyfriend.

26:31.564 --> 26:33.505
You should be happy she even talks to you.

26:34.045 --> 26:34.933
- But--
- But.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.029
- But.
- But.

26:36.029 --> 26:37.779
But shut up, okay?

26:38.439 --> 26:41.479
This is your first relationship.
It's like your first car.

26:42.269 --> 26:44.589
You're gonna go fast,
way too fast.

26:44.879 --> 26:46.296
You're probably gonna wreck it.

26:46.776 --> 26:49.469
So wear a seat belt and enjoy the ride.

26:52.299 --> 26:53.670
Calhoun, I'm gonna be honest.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.311
I'm trying to open up to you here,
but you're really not helping.

26:59.021 --> 27:01.906
Maybe that's because I'm not the one 
you should be opening up to.

27:04.716 --> 27:06.593
Boom.
Nailed it.

27:38.703 --> 27:40.859
(sighs) Hey, guys, I--

27:41.243 --> 27:43.935
Ah, Theodore.
You return.

27:46.495 --> 27:48.019
And with my coupon, I see.

27:48.269 --> 27:49.468
Well done!

27:52.088 --> 27:53.787
You're playing my game without me.

27:54.277 --> 27:56.131
(DK) Not anymore.
We're out of candy

27:56.131 --> 27:57.839
and we beat all the levels.

28:02.019 --> 28:03.082
Before it expires?

28:04.272 --> 28:05.004
No.

28:05.514 --> 28:06.887
Um, yes.

28:07.337 --> 28:08.157
No!

28:08.157 --> 28:10.066
- I command you--
- I said NO.

28:10.066 --> 28:12.257
- Ted--
- You ate my dead dad candy.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.048
I am the Drift King!

28:14.048 --> 28:15.691
Yeah, well maybe you shouldn't be.

28:16.901 --> 28:19.453
Seriously, we do bad stuff 
for you all the time,

28:19.743 --> 28:21.133
but you don't care.

28:21.733 --> 28:25.107
You only care about yourself.
You're not a king, dude.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.810
You're a senior!
You're going to college next year.

28:28.210 --> 28:30.331
Just grow the hell up!

28:32.371 --> 28:34.444
(sighs) I could be a better king than you.

28:40.654 --> 28:42.534
Is that a challenge, Ted?

28:43.834 --> 28:46.055
Yeah, it is.

28:47.315 --> 28:49.807
I challenge you 
for the title of Drift King.

28:53.187 --> 28:54.285
I accept.

28:56.145 --> 28:57.972
And when you race against king...

28:58.472 --> 28:59.703
(snaps fingers)

29:00.787 --> 29:03.624
..you race against his kingdom.

29:06.572 --> 29:08.045
Let's drift.

29:08.921 --> 29:14.567
(revving engines)

29:23.056 --> 29:29.517
(heavy metal music)

29:41.859 --> 29:44.390
(tires squeal)

29:44.390 --> 29:50.209
(engines rev)

31:11.312 --> 31:15.966
(engine hums distantly)

31:18.152 --> 31:22.089
(engine roars)

31:22.987 --> 31:23.955
(birds whistle)

31:23.955 --> 31:24.841
(engine roars)

31:29.759 --> 31:31.127
(tires squeal)

31:38.937 --> 31:44.607
(clock ticks)

32:02.987 --> 32:08.937
(tires squeal)

32:15.497 --> 32:16.622
Sorry, DK.

32:18.177 --> 32:22.660
(tires squeal)

32:39.648 --> 32:41.727
(tires squeal)

32:51.227 --> 32:52.427
Oh!

33:12.581 --> 33:15.472
(tires squeal)

33:59.286 --> 34:00.589
The kingdom's yours, DK.

34:47.370 --> 34:50.101
(sighs) Okay, Wendell.
I'm only talking to you

34:50.101 --> 34:51.701
because you're sleeping.

34:51.701 --> 34:54.579
And last week I burned my diary
to see what the ashes would look like.

34:55.119 --> 34:58.745
Which was stupid.
I don't know why I did that.

35:00.375 --> 35:02.322
I don't really know 
what's happening to me.

35:12.212 --> 35:13.949
You know I still have all my grandparents?

35:14.778 --> 35:18.068
Ted's father is dead, but I still get 
four sweaters for Christmas every year.

35:19.088 --> 35:21.326
Which just seems really mean to me.

35:22.496 --> 35:26.082
It's callous and random.
And then it's over.

35:28.502 --> 35:30.671
I don't really know why 
I'm playing anymore.

35:32.071 --> 35:35.345
(murmuring in sleep)

35:37.202 --> 35:38.610
It's not your fault though.

35:41.660 --> 35:42.556
(sighs)

35:47.044 --> 35:50.256
(typing)

36:25.327 --> 36:28.117
(computer blips)

36:40.488 --> 36:44.933
(alarm beeps)

36:44.933 --> 36:46.108
(sighs)

36:54.878 --> 36:56.056
(cell phone bloops)

36:57.814 --> 36:58.992
(sighs)

37:08.197 --> 37:09.571
(sighs)

37:15.048 --> 37:17.206
(muttering in sleep)

37:30.818 --> 37:33.912
(birds whistle)

37:34.355 --> 37:35.551
(sighs)

37:51.631 --> 37:52.586
Hey.

37:53.682 --> 37:55.967
Look, let me go first, all right?
I gotta get this out.

37:57.087 --> 37:57.956
Okay.

37:59.138 --> 38:02.215
(sighs) I never really had a dad.

38:03.435 --> 38:07.775
And my mom was an addict,
so I pretty much took care of myself.

38:08.665 --> 38:13.135
And I got used to being alone.
I got pretty good at it.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.984
But then I came here and I met Ted,

38:18.024 --> 38:19.748
and I met Ki, and I met you.

38:22.468 --> 38:24.654
And I fell for you like that.

38:26.371 --> 38:30.643
And for the first time,
I didn't feel alone.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.477
And when I thought you were leaving,

38:38.747 --> 38:41.371
I should've been happy for you.
I should've, but...

38:42.851 --> 38:45.829
I was so scared of losing you
that I lashed out.

38:48.389 --> 38:50.380
And it was selfish, and it was horrible,

38:51.110 --> 38:53.064
and I'm so sorry that I hurt you, Jenny.

38:56.913 --> 38:57.942
(sighs)

39:05.519 --> 39:07.121
I'm glad you went first.

39:08.832 --> 39:10.426
Why, what were you going to say?

39:13.910 --> 39:18.510
(touching music)

39:26.934 --> 39:29.606
(groans) Well, the game jam's 
almost over, Ki.

39:30.136 --> 39:34.337
Okay, I guess you win.
Life really is meaningless, huh?

39:34.568 --> 39:37.675
(victory music)

39:39.755 --> 39:40.517
What?

39:43.657 --> 39:44.998
No!

39:49.637 --> 39:50.721
Wait, huh?

39:51.536 --> 39:52.977
What is that? (gasps)

39:56.810 --> 39:59.962
Oh! Oh my god! (gasps)

40:03.242 --> 40:07.341
Oh my god! (laughs)
Look this--this is awesome!

40:07.415 --> 40:10.565
Oh! I'm flying.
It's me.

40:10.565 --> 40:12.802
I'm flying!
I'm flying!

40:12.802 --> 40:14.168
Ki, it's me.
I'm flying.

40:16.928 --> 40:19.245
Oh my god!
This game rules!

40:19.245 --> 40:20.361
(laughs)

40:20.361 --> 40:21.549
(gasps)

40:36.036 --> 40:38.698
That's the best game <i>ever</i>.

40:40.285 --> 40:41.641
(Wendell gasps)

40:46.421 --> 40:47.925
You're great, RA Wendell.

40:51.975 --> 40:53.005
Thanks, Ki.

40:55.433 --> 40:56.849
Oh! (laughs)

41:00.728 --> 41:02.708
- What was that?
- It's nothing.

41:03.248 --> 41:04.796
Okay, now go clean the bathroom.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.893
(laughs)

41:05.893 --> 41:07.191
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

41:07.611 --> 41:08.649
Okay.

41:09.503 --> 41:10.547
It's this way.

41:11.167 --> 41:13.281
Smash Mouth signed a contract.

41:13.281 --> 41:14.904
If we re-neg, we owe them big.

41:15.214 --> 41:16.028
Fine, whatever.

41:16.028 --> 41:17.356
Just make sure they're 
not in the teacher's lounge.

41:17.356 --> 41:19.402
- Anything else?
- I got something!

41:21.322 --> 41:22.635
Barnstormer!

41:22.635 --> 41:24.203
Hey, Calhoulligan.

41:24.653 --> 41:26.675
Just came by to give you the good news.

41:27.535 --> 41:30.096
Napalm broke 400. Hah!

41:30.626 --> 41:34.140
- [inaudible's] a champion.
- Awesome news, brother.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.756
Shane.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.995
Shane Barnstormer.

41:40.995 --> 41:42.766
Yeah, didn't I tell you?

41:43.266 --> 41:46.627
Oh wait, no.
I faked my own death.

41:46.627 --> 41:49.830
I changed my name to Pizza,
and then I took down

41:49.830 --> 41:51.528
your school from the inside.

41:52.558 --> 41:55.345
Oops. (mad chuckle)

41:58.245 --> 42:00.198
- (camera snaps)
- (laughter)

42:00.198 --> 42:01.476
What a face!

42:01.836 --> 42:04.075
You really should've taken that check.

42:06.440 --> 42:07.474
Fuck!

42:08.648 --> 42:10.386
Hey, guys, mind if we join?

42:10.386 --> 42:12.119
Heck yeah, we don't. 
Sit down.

42:15.366 --> 42:16.515
(sighs)

42:17.553 --> 42:20.285
Well, looks like everything's 
back to normal.

42:20.687 --> 42:23.628
Good morning, VGHS!

42:23.848 --> 42:26.715
I hope you're enjoying 
that cafeteria breakfast

42:27.065 --> 42:32.469
because it's your last!
(mad laughter)

42:34.219 --> 42:37.617
(yelling)

42:46.632 --> 42:49.591
(students murmur)

42:52.728 --> 42:53.879
(student) Oh no!

42:55.765 --> 42:57.685
(screaming)

42:57.894 --> 43:00.987
(cackling)

43:10.814 --> 43:12.871
You cannot win!

43:13.685 --> 43:16.159
(cackling)

43:16.767 --> 43:23.119
(ominous music)
