Oh, baby!

Let me have it.
Let me have all of it.

Oh, baby, let me have it!

01:45.200 --> 01:46.800
Let me have all of it!

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Oh, baby, let me have it.
Let me have all of it.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.600
Oh, you okay?

01:57.400 --> 01:58.500
I don't know.

01:59.200 --> 02:00.400
What were you dreaming?

02:00.900 --> 02:03.900
Huh? I wasn't
dreaming anything.

02:03.935 --> 02:05.200
I was sleeping.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.100
It w nice.

Sorry.

Oh, you're kidding!

02:44.700 --> 02:46.400
BOY:
Help!

02:47.100 --> 02:49.000
Please!

JOE:
Allison?
(gasps)

03:02.600 --> 03:03.600
You okay?

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm fine. I'm just trying
to take a shower.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.000
Well, you got
to turn on the
water first.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.700
Allison, you
doing anything?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.800
Are you familiar with State
Assemblyman Henry Rykoff?

04:14.900 --> 04:16.600
I know he's a
state assemblyman.

04:16.635 --> 04:18.300
I know his first name
is Henry.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.300
Died in his sleep
last night.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.200
Apparently, his widow
is fiercely protective

04:23.235 --> 04:24.900
of her late husband's legacy.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.300
Okay.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.900
After she discovered
the assemblyman had passed,

04:28.935 --> 04:30.600
she called EMS.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.900
I don't know what's
going on over there,

04:31.935 --> 04:33.600
but Emergency Medical
called the police

04:33.635 --> 04:34.700
and everyone's been there

04:34.735 --> 04:36.300
since before 7:00
this morning.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.100
It's past 10:00.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.400
What do you think's
going on?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
I have no idea.

04:40.835 --> 04:42.400
But whatever it is,
the governor asked me

04:42.435 --> 04:44.200
to get over there
and make it go away.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.600
What am I doing?

04:46.000 --> 04:46.800
Oh, I don't know.

04:46.835 --> 04:49.800
The assemblyman died.
Isn't that your area?

04:53.600 --> 04:54.600
Mrs. Rykoff,

04:55.400 --> 04:57.300
I'm District Attorney
Manuel Devalos.

04:57.335 --> 04:58.600
This is Allison Dubois.

04:58.635 --> 05:00.700
She's a bereavement
counselor who works
with my office.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.100
I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.500
The governor asked us
to come by

05:03.535 --> 05:04.800
and see if we could
be of any help

05:04.835 --> 05:07.800
during what he knows must be
a very difficult time for you.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.400
Help? Absolutely,
we could use some help.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.900
Those idiots with the ambulance
called the police,

05:13.935 --> 05:16.200
and the police won't let me
call a funeral home.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.700
My husband is lying dead
in his bed.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.100
He's been there for hours.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.200
I would like to get him
where he belongs,

05:22.235 --> 05:24.100
so we can move on with
the business of his funeral.

05:24.135 --> 05:25.100
I understand.

05:25.135 --> 05:25.900
Mr. District Attorney,

05:25.935 --> 05:27.000
my name is Casey Frank.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.700
I was the assemblyman's chief
of staff, also a family friend.

05:30.735 --> 05:31.600
This is Scott Brittenham,

05:31.635 --> 05:32.800
the family attorney.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.800
Apparently, the maid
discovered the body

05:34.835 --> 05:36.300
and immediately dialed 911

05:36.335 --> 05:38.800
before Mrs. Rykoff here had
a chance to make contact

05:38.835 --> 05:39.900
with the funeral home.

05:40.200 --> 05:40.900
I think you'll see

05:40.935 --> 05:42.900
it's all a big
misunderstanding.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.800
All anyone wants really, is to protect
the assemblyman's dignity.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.900
Of course.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.500
Let us see what we
can find out, please.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.300
Excuse us.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.500
MAN:
Look at his neck.

05:56.600 --> 05:57.300
What do you mean?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.400
All the ambulance
guys wanted to do

05:59.435 --> 06:01.200
was lift him up and
get him out of here.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.900
I don't get a bonus for saying
something smells fishy.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.800
Just go upstairs,
look at his neck.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.100
This man did not die
in his sleep.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.500
I've taken a look at your
late husband, Mrs. Rykoff.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.600
We have a problem.

07:10.300 --> 07:11.600
No, there is no problem.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.900
My husband served
the state for 32 years.

07:15.900 --> 07:18.700
He's entitled to privacy
with regard to his life

07:19.300 --> 07:21.800
and dignity with regard
to his death.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.600
Buhe did not die
in his sleep.

07:24.635 --> 07:27.300
We're not even convinced
he died in that bed.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.900
Is my client being accused of something here,
Mr. District Attorney?

07:31.100 --> 07:32.100
Not yet.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.800
My husband and I
were married for 37 years.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.900
In 37 years, a couple
can grow very close

07:40.800 --> 07:43.100
and very distant
at the same time.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.100
Henry got up in the middle
of the night.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.200
It wasn't unusual.

07:50.235 --> 07:52.300
He liked to use the bathroom
down the hall.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.900
I heard him get up,

07:55.935 --> 07:58.200
make his
way down the hall in the dark.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.100
I even heard him cough
and wheeze through the wall.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.800
He had that cold
that's been going around.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.300
I must have fallen back asleep,
and when I woke up again,

08:08.600 --> 08:11.600
I realized that Henry
still hadn't returned.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.500
Finally,
I came down here.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.600
He had taken the belt
of his robe...

08:21.300 --> 08:24.100
used that beam,

08:24.800 --> 08:26.400
put it around his neck.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.300
I kept screaming his name...

08:33.299 --> 08:35.200
but I think he was already dead.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
Mrs. Rykoff, I will do
everything in my power

08:44.200 --> 08:46.500
to be sure that when a death
certificate is issued...

08:46.535 --> 08:47.900
He did not commit suicide.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.600
Nothing could have been further
from his mind.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.400
And you know this how?

08:56.400 --> 08:59.900
I know this
because Mrs. Rykoff called me

08:59.935 --> 09:01.900
to help her get the body
down from the ceiling.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.400
I know this
because when I came in the room,

09:06.435 --> 09:07.800
his computer was on.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.400
There was a pornographic
Web site on the screen.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.700
His pajama bottoms
were around his ankles

09:12.735 --> 09:15.000
and was clear from the state
of the rest of his body

09:15.800 --> 09:17.300
exactly what he was doing,

09:19.100 --> 09:21.000
exactly what his intention was.

09:21.300 --> 09:24.800
And it had nothing to do
with killing oneself.

09:25.700 --> 09:28.800
And you helped Mrs. Rykoff
move the body?

09:30.000 --> 09:30.900
Yes.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.800
Up the stairs
and down the hall

09:33.835 --> 09:35.100
and into the bedroom.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.800
I beg of you all,

09:37.500 --> 09:40.800
let my husband be remembered
for his great work

09:42.000 --> 09:44.800
and not for some foolishness

09:45.600 --> 09:47.700
no one was ever meant
to know about.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.200
BOY:
Help me!

10:02.900 --> 10:04.000
Do you hear that?

10:19.500 --> 10:21.500
Somebody!

10:23.200 --> 10:25.200
What are you doing?

10:26.200 --> 10:30.000
Put your head
on the pillow,
close your eyes and let's get some sleep.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.200
You didn't hear that either?

10:33.235 --> 10:34.400
Shh.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.700
BOY:
Help me! Please!

11:02.800 --> 11:05.600
Help me!

11:07.600 --> 11:09.500
Please! Somebody!

11:14.600 --> 11:17.500
Look Like he was
in some kind of a hole

11:17.535 --> 11:19.700
or maybe it was a cave
or some kind of a well, or...

11:19.800 --> 11:21.800
Whatever it was, it looked
like it was natural,

11:21.835 --> 11:22.600
not man-made.

11:22.635 --> 11:23.800
That's great, but, Allison,

11:23.835 --> 11:26.200
there are no missing children
of that approximate age

11:26.235 --> 11:28.200
who match anything close
to that description.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.300
What do you mean?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.400
I mean, you may
have dreamt it,

11:31.435 --> 11:32.600
but it doesn't appear
to have happened--

11:32.635 --> 11:34.200
not yet, not
around here anyway.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.600
Well, maybe his parents
haven't reported it yet.

11:36.635 --> 11:38.300
Maybe they don't realize
he's missing.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.100
You said he was dirty,
you said he looked like

11:41.135 --> 11:42.700
he'd been wherever
he was for a while.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.300
I mean, come on,
if your child was missing

11:44.335 --> 11:46.200
for long enough to be beat up
by the elements like that

11:46.235 --> 11:48.200
you'd notice, you'd report it.

11:48.235 --> 11:49.400
What are you saying?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.300
I'm saying there's nothing
more I can do.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.000
I can't mount a search until
I have someone to search for.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.800
And honestly, I've got
about ten other fires

11:55.835 --> 11:57.800
I got to put out
this morning, including...

11:59.200 --> 12:01.100
one that you might
be interested in.

12:02.000 --> 12:02.900
What's this?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.900
The coroner's report
on Assemblyman Rykoff.

12:05.935 --> 12:07.100
What am I looking at?

12:08.700 --> 12:10.800
"High levels
of dexohyphrodan..."

12:10.835 --> 12:12.000
Dexohydrophan.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.200
"were present
in the deceased's system."

12:15.400 --> 12:16.200
What's that?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.200
It's a libido inhibitor.

12:18.235 --> 12:21.000
It's like anti-Viagra.
Kills the sex drive.

12:21.500 --> 12:22.300
I don't get it.

12:22.335 --> 12:23.400
Neither do I.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.100
Dexohydrophan is a drug
usually reserved

12:26.135 --> 12:28.200
for chronic sex offenders.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.500
You're saying Assemblyman Rykoff
was a sex offender?

12:31.535 --> 12:32.300
Of course not.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.600
But I got a better question.

12:33.635 --> 12:35.900
Why's a guy who's loaded to
the gills on libido-inhibitors

12:35.935 --> 12:38.300
hanging from a belt with his
John Thomas in his hand,

12:38.335 --> 12:39.600
looking at Internet porn?

12:45.700 --> 12:47.400
Girls down?

12:49.500 --> 12:51.400
All except Ariel,

12:51.600 --> 12:53.800
who just asked me
what "clubbing" is.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.300
And when will she be
old enough to do it.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.300
I feel like

12:59.335 --> 13:01.400
I looked at a million files,

13:01.435 --> 13:04.100
stared at a billion pictures.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.900
All of those kids.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.000
I just know he's out there,
scared and alone.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.100
If one of our girls...

13:15.135 --> 13:17.000
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

13:17.035 --> 13:18.100
They're fine.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.400
They're in bed.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.400
All except
for Ariel.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.100
She wants to know
what "clubbing" is.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.000
I see you.
I see you up there.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.800
Hey, where are you going?

14:06.200 --> 14:08.700
No, please, you can't leave me.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.900
No! Please don't leave me!

14:16.600 --> 14:18.300
Allison, hey, what
are you doing?

14:18.400 --> 14:20.300
I saw it, the place
where the boy is.

14:20.335 --> 14:22.300
It's this hole, this glowing
hole in the ground.

14:22.335 --> 14:23.800
I've got to call Scanlon.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.800
Hold on a second.
You're not making
any sense.

14:26.900 --> 14:27.700
What...

14:27.900 --> 14:30.500
what do you know today
that you didn't know yesterday?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.100
A hole?

14:32.200 --> 14:35.100
You're going to wake the man up
in the middle of the night

14:35.135 --> 14:39.000
to tell him about
a hole in the ground that glows.

14:39.035 --> 14:41.000
Allison...
I got to do something, Joe.

14:41.035 --> 14:42.400
He's drinking green muck.

14:42.435 --> 14:43.500
He's dying out there.

14:43.900 --> 14:44.900
The whole thing
was green.

14:44.935 --> 14:46.100
It glowed green.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.000
Wait a second. Green?

14:49.600 --> 14:50.900
Like phosphorus?

14:53.100 --> 14:54.800
Have you ever heard
of the Living Caves?

14:55.200 --> 14:56.800
No, the Living Caves--
what are they?

14:57.100 --> 15:00.700
Well, they're these
naturally occurring
holes in the ground

15:00.735 --> 15:01.800
and people say
they're living

15:01.835 --> 15:03.800
because they still
have big pools

15:03.835 --> 15:05.800
of acidic water
at the bottom of them.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.200
So they're still eroding
away the soil,

15:08.235 --> 15:10.600
forming new passages,
growing, living.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
Okay.
Here they are.

15:11.835 --> 15:13.100
Okay, what made you
think of them?

15:13.500 --> 15:15.100
Uh, well, they're
filled with phosphorus,

15:15.135 --> 15:17.100
so at night they glow.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.300
Okay, show me exactly
where they are.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.300
Allison, there's over 200 square
miles of these caves.

15:23.335 --> 15:24.800
There's no way
to narrow it down.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.600
Wait a second. What's this?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.400
Railroad track?

15:31.300 --> 15:32.300
Railroad track...

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Hey, you think you could take the girls
to school?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.500
You're going there?

15:37.700 --> 15:39.000
You're insane.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.700
ALLISON:
Hello?

15:56.700 --> 15:57.900
Hello?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.800
Hello?!

16:07.600 --> 16:08.400
Hello?

16:16.100 --> 16:17.400
Hello?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.900
Is anyone in there?

16:21.100 --> 16:24.400
BOY:
Hello? Is
somebody up there?

16:25.200 --> 16:28.500
I'm down here. Somebody,
anybody, can you hear me?

16:28.535 --> 16:30.600
Yes, someone's here.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.500
Yes, I can hear you.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.300
Keep talking. There's a lot
of holes around here.

16:35.335 --> 16:38.100
Oh, please, get me out!
Get me out! Get me out!

16:38.135 --> 16:40.300
I'm coming.Keep calling out.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.100
???

16:42.500 --> 16:43.700
Can you hear me?

16:43.900 --> 16:45.500
Get me out!
Get me out!

16:45.535 --> 16:47.400
Oh, please, get me out!

16:48.300 --> 16:49.900
Get me out! Get me out!

16:51.100 --> 16:52.300
I am.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.600
Here, let me throw you down
some water.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.100
I have some food.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.099
I need to call people.
What's your name?

17:06.300 --> 17:10.300
Jimmy... James.
Jamison Nessler.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.900
Hi, Jamison Nessler.

17:11.935 --> 17:13.300
I'm Allison.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.099
How bad is your leg?

17:16.599 --> 17:18.800
It hurts. It's hard to climb.

17:18.835 --> 17:20.900
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

17:20.935 --> 17:21.900
I'm going to stay right here

17:21.935 --> 17:23.900
and use my phone
to call for help.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.099
You just eat.
I'll be right here.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.600
He's here. He's in this hole.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.200
Young man...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.900
if you can hear me,
I want you to...

17:51.000 --> 17:52.600
Shine a light down there.

18:02.200 --> 18:03.000
No.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.100
No, I just saw him.
I spoke to him.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.100
???? how much it costs

18:11.135 --> 18:13.600
to land an emergency helicopter

18:13.900 --> 18:17.900
with three Forest Service
Rangers in the Arizona desert?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.900
Hmm, no, no, I don't.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.100
$1,700.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.100
$1,700 to pick up a skeleton.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
He kept saying,
"A skeleton

18:32.735 --> 18:34.500
"is not an emergency, ma'am.

18:34.535 --> 18:36.600
Do you have any idea
how much this is going to cost?"

18:37.400 --> 18:39.000
Of course, now I do.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.800
Aren't you going
to say anything?

18:43.835 --> 18:44.700
What am I going
to say?

18:44.735 --> 18:46.700
It's absurd.
I don't have $1,700.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.400
I mean, I have it,
we have it,

18:48.435 --> 18:52.400
but not to spend on unexpected
emergency skeleton pickups.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.400
I mean, what are they going
to do if we don't pay?

18:55.800 --> 18:56.500
Cut us off?

18:56.535 --> 18:59.100
Not show up the next time we
have bones that need rescuing?

19:00.300 --> 19:01.600
I'm sorry.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.100
WOMAN:
Oh, baby...

19:16.600 --> 19:17.800
Let me have it.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.600
Let me have all of it.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.600
Oh, baby, let me...

19:26.000 --> 19:27.300
ALLISON:
Something
doesn't add up.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.500
I'm talking about the suicide
of Assemblyman Rykoff.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.700
You want to close
that door, please?

19:41.200 --> 19:43.300
That fact that Henry Rykoff
committed suicide

19:43.335 --> 19:45.000
is supposed to be
a closely held secret.

19:45.035 --> 19:46.500
It's not something
we want to talk about

19:46.535 --> 19:47.700
where others can hear.

19:47.735 --> 19:48.900
Of course. I'm sorry.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.300
I'm already pretty far out
on a limb with this thing.

19:52.335 --> 19:54.800
Hiding the material facts
of this man's death,

19:54.835 --> 19:56.900
walking his death certificate
through channels.

19:56.935 --> 19:57.600
For what it's worth,

19:57.635 --> 19:59.700
I don't think he actually did
commit suicide.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.200
You remember Mrs. Dubois
from the other day?

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
And this is
Detective Lee Scanlon

20:09.435 --> 20:11.300
who works with my office
on a regular basis.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.500
I've taken them
into our confidence.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.200
He's someone
you can trust.

20:15.900 --> 20:17.800
Well, I'll have to take
your word for that.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.700
Now, what am I doing here?

20:21.200 --> 20:24.500
Frankly, Mr. District Attorney,
I have a funeral to plan.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.500
I appreciate that this
is a difficult time.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.500
But if I'm going to get you
a death certificate

20:30.535 --> 20:33.800
that indicates your husband died
in his sleep of natural causes,

20:33.835 --> 20:36.400
I'm going to need your help
answering some questions.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.200
Mr Rykoff, did you
know your husband was
taking dexohydrophan?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.400
Do you know what
dexohydrophan is?

20:46.900 --> 20:49.900
Well, you people are
just determined

20:49.935 --> 20:52.700
to wake up every sleeping dog
in the village, aren't you?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.400
Yes, I am familiar
with the drug,

20:55.435 --> 20:58.300
and I was entirely aware
that my husband was taking it.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.000
He had been taking it since...

21:02.035 --> 21:04.000
some time in the early '90s.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.400
Mrs. Rykoff,

21:05.700 --> 21:08.600
it's my unrstanding that
this drug is normally prescribed

21:08.635 --> 21:10.600
to registered sex offenders.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.700
Why would the assembly...?

21:15.800 --> 21:19.800
Years ago, I became aware
that in addition

21:19.900 --> 21:23.400
to Henry's voracious ambition,
he also possessed

21:23.435 --> 21:25.500
a seemingly endless
appetite for...

21:28.500 --> 21:31.800
What's the polite way to say it?
Companionship?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.200
Not that he didn't love me.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.000
I never doubted that.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.900
But, apparently, in addition

21:40.100 --> 21:42.300
he needed something
more dangerous,

21:42.335 --> 21:45.400
something more...
varied.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.900
And you knew about this?

21:47.500 --> 21:48.700
I sensed it.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.800
We had no children.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.400
He was extraordinarily
busy with his career.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.900
I still couldn't account
for all his time.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.600
One night,
he came to me.

22:04.100 --> 22:05.400
He was terrified.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.000
Something had happened.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.000
He never told me what,
and I never asked.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.600
Someone got pregnant, I suspect.

22:16.635 --> 22:20.100
Whatever it was,
whatever he had to do

22:20.135 --> 22:21.700
to clean up after himself...

22:23.500 --> 22:24.800
it changed him.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.100
He confessed to me
that he just had these

22:29.800 --> 22:32.000
compulsions, he called them.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.600
That he hated himself for it.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.900
So he found this place
in Minneapolis.

22:41.700 --> 22:44.800
He spent two weeks,
intense counseling,

22:44.835 --> 22:45.900
medication.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.800
And it seemed
to work for him?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.100
It certainly worked for us.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.600
It became our secret...

22:54.700 --> 22:57.400
our deep, dark secret.

22:59.500 --> 23:00.800
Until today.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.300
Actually bound us together
in a way

23:04.335 --> 23:07.300
that old-fashioned intimacy
never did.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.900
So now you know everything.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.100
I'm sorry.

23:13.135 --> 23:14.000
I still don't understand.

23:14.035 --> 23:15.600
When you found your husband
the other night,

23:15.635 --> 23:17.400
it appears he was trying

23:17.435 --> 23:20.600
to get a kind of a, um,
heightened...

23:20.635 --> 23:23.400
The drug kills the ability
to get aroused,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.700
but not the instinct.

23:26.700 --> 23:27.600
The way you sometimes

23:27.635 --> 23:31.600
see a neutered dog

23:34.600 --> 23:38.200
Oh, I felt so horrible
for him sometimes.

23:41.700 --> 23:42.600
Is there anything else?

23:42.635 --> 23:46.600
I-I really would like
to put him, this,

23:46.635 --> 23:49.100
all of this to rest.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
I'm good.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.400
I think we're
all good.

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
That's him.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.300
That's the boy from my dream.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.400
Ain't modern science amazing?
Just like on TV.

24:03.435 --> 24:04.700
You give those guys
a bag of bones,

24:04.735 --> 24:06.700
a day later, you get
a name and a school picture.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.100
Say hello to Jimmy Nessler.
Jimmy Nessler.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.900
He just turned 12 at the time
of his disappearance,

24:13.935 --> 24:16.700
which his parents first reported
to police in 1991.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.200
1991?

24:18.235 --> 24:22.100
My God, his parents--
I can't imagine their pain.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.700
One of those nightmares
you hear about

24:24.735 --> 24:25.800
from time to time.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.300
Only child.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.200
Kids gets on his bike
to go to school one morning,

24:29.235 --> 24:30.300
never comes home.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.700
Nobody saw him,
never left any clues.

24:34.100 --> 24:35.900
Just, uh, vanished.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.300
It was an exhaustive search.It went on for months.

24:38.335 --> 24:39.300
Has anyone called 'em yet?

24:39.335 --> 24:41.000
I mean, his parents?

24:41.700 --> 24:43.300
Left the state in '94.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200
The father died in a car
accident two years later.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.800
His blood-alcohol level
was through the roof.

24:47.835 --> 24:49.700
Mother had a series
of mental problems.

24:49.735 --> 24:51.800
In and out of homeless shelters
through the late '90s.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.200
After that...

24:53.600 --> 24:54.900
So nothing's different?

24:55.600 --> 24:59.600
If I'd never seen what I saw,
if I never found what I found...

25:00.300 --> 25:02.100
everything would
still be the same?

25:13.200 --> 25:14.800
MAN:
Time to wake up, Jimmy.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.600
You doing all right?

25:21.600 --> 25:24.000
That was quite a little nap
you had for yourself.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.200
Can I get you
more to drink?

25:29.700 --> 25:31.000
Where's my clothes?

25:31.300 --> 25:32.900
You wanted to take a swim.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.300
Do you remember taking a swim?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.400
They're over there.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.800
Did you have a good time?

25:51.600 --> 25:53.100
I hope you had a good time.

25:54.100 --> 25:54.800
And don't worry.

25:54.835 --> 25:57.000
I'm not going to let
anyone know you were here.

25:57.700 --> 25:59.600
I know how much trouble
a kid your age can get into

25:59.635 --> 26:00.800
by skipping school.

26:02.900 --> 26:04.900
Did you put
the dirty magazines back?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
Can't have my wife
finding those.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.300
But if you ever
want to look at 'em again...

26:13.300 --> 26:15.500
I can even make you
one of my special drinks.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.200
Nice meeting you, Jimmy.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.700
Go after him.Make sure he's okay.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.300
He's okay.

26:29.335 --> 26:30.500
He's drunk.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.600
He's young. He's sweet.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.500
You know, I'm only
a couple years older.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.100
It's not about that.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.200
Just go after him.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.800
???

26:56.100 --> 26:57.400
Look at you.

26:58.100 --> 26:59.700
I'm impressed.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.500
There's nothing impressive
about a 55-year-old man

27:03.535 --> 27:06.700
who gets up before dawn
to trudge a mile and a half

27:06.735 --> 27:08.700
just because he's convinced
if he doesn't

27:08.735 --> 27:10.500
he'll die ten years
before his time.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.300
I beg to differ.
I'm impressed.

27:12.700 --> 27:13.600
Duly noted.

27:13.635 --> 27:15.700
What brings you out
at this ridiculous hour?

27:15.735 --> 27:16.700
I called your house

27:16.735 --> 27:18.400
and your wife said
you already left.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.400
Henry Rykoff, the dead
assemblyman,

27:22.435 --> 27:24.000
knew Jimmy Nessler.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.400
Okay.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.600
Allison, Jimmy Nessler's
been dead almost 15 years.

27:34.100 --> 27:35.100
He died from a combination

27:35.135 --> 27:37.600
of starvation,
dehydration and exposure.

27:37.900 --> 27:39.700
Assemblyman Rykoff
died several days ago

27:39.735 --> 27:42.100
and in my opinion,
by his own hand.

27:43.200 --> 27:44.700
What do the two have
to do with each other?

27:44.735 --> 27:46.500
I don't know. Something.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.100
I think when
Mrs. Rykoff was talking about

27:49.135 --> 27:52.400
the assemblyman's... appetites,

27:55.500 --> 27:58.600
And I presume all of this came
to you the way that most things

27:58.635 --> 28:00.000
come to you?

28:00.800 --> 28:04.300
I'm sorry, but I don't see
how any of this is relevant to anything.

28:04.335 --> 28:05.300
The boy is dead.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.900
Rykoff is dead.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.100
Since we can be
reasonably certain

28:09.135 --> 28:11.100
that the dead boy
didn't kill Rykoff...?

28:11.135 --> 28:12.800
What if it's
the other way around?

28:13.400 --> 28:16.600
I just like to confirm, in fact,
the assemblyman knew the boy.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.600
Why?

28:18.300 --> 28:19.500
i'm sorry.I know why.

28:19.535 --> 28:21.300
I guess what
I'm really trying to say is would it be

28:21.335 --> 28:23.400
such a terrible thing to just let sleeping dogs lie?

28:23.435 --> 28:24.400
Yes!

28:25.100 --> 28:27.600
Isn't Jimmy Nessler
entitled to justice?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.300
If someone stole his life,

28:29.335 --> 28:31.400
isn't it our job
to find out who did it?

28:31.435 --> 28:34.700
Of course, it is,
but the victim is long dead

28:34.800 --> 28:36.900
and the man you think might
be responsible is dead, too.

28:36.935 --> 28:39.100
And frankly, I'm dubious
that any of  is true.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.900
And I strongly doubt
that even if it were,we could prove
any of it.

28:41.935 --> 28:44.600
What I am convinced of,given the times in which we live

28:44.635 --> 28:45.700
and the climate
in which we work,

28:45.735 --> 28:47.700
if you go swimming around
in all this muck,

28:47.735 --> 28:49.900
you will definitely stir up
some kind of dirt

28:49.935 --> 28:52.400
and it may reflect badly
on a man who isn't alive

28:52.435 --> 28:53.800
to defend himself.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.000
So where does that leave us?

28:57.035 --> 29:00.000
I'd still like to try
and find out if he knew the boy.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.500
And how do you hope to do that?

29:03.700 --> 29:04.400
Ask!

29:04.435 --> 29:06.900
No, I am not bringing
his widow back here.

29:06.935 --> 29:08.200
She wasn't out the door
ten minutes

29:08.235 --> 29:10.100
and the governor was
on the phone lecturing me

29:10.135 --> 29:11.900
about decency and fairness

29:11.935 --> 29:13.000
and respect
for the grieving.

29:13.035 --> 29:14.100
Can I talk to his attorney?

29:14.135 --> 29:16.100
Or what about that aide of his?

29:16.300 --> 29:18.500
The one that his wife called
to help move the body?

29:20.000 --> 29:20.700
Sir?!

29:20.735 --> 29:21.800
I have to take
a shower.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.300
Just stay away from the widow.

29:24.335 --> 29:26.700
And if the governor calls,
I'm putting him on with you.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.100
I'm sure he knew him
or at least knew of him.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.400
We all did. I did.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.400
It was a big deal
when this kid went missing.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.800
I mean, our school
organized search parties.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.300
I think I was in
the tenth grade

29:39.335 --> 29:41.500
and he was in,
like, seventh.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.300
Yeah, definitely
the assemblyman

29:43.335 --> 29:45.300
was almost certainly
aware of him.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.900
No, I mean,
before he went missing.

29:46.935 --> 29:48.800
Do you think they knew
each other, Mr. Frank?

29:48.835 --> 29:51.000
Casey. Call me Casey.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.200
I don't know-- this
is all before my time.

29:53.235 --> 29:54.800
I didn't start working
for Mr. Rykoff

29:54.835 --> 29:56.100
until I was out of college.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.100
Hmm. But you knew him?

29:59.100 --> 30:01.100
I did yard work
for the Rykoffs.

30:01.135 --> 30:03.300
And Mr. Rykoff was very much
a father figure to me.

30:03.335 --> 30:04.700
Really pushed me
to go to college,

30:04.735 --> 30:05.700
which I was not
inclined to do.

30:05.735 --> 30:07.000
Introduced me to politics,

30:07.035 --> 30:10.000
or "public service,"
which is what

30:10.035 --> 30:10.900
he liked to call it.

30:10.935 --> 30:12.000
But again,
back then,

30:12.035 --> 30:14.300
I was in high school.
I have no idea he knew Jimmy.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
I mean, why would he?

30:17.100 --> 30:18.500
Let me ask you a question.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.200
I read just this morning
that you were being asked to run

30:21.235 --> 30:23.400
to fill the assemblyman's
vacant seat.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.300
You're young.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.900
You're at the beginning
of your career.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.400
You get a call in the middle
of the night

30:30.435 --> 30:31.800
to move a dead body,

30:32.200 --> 30:34.300
to disturb what may be
a crime scene.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.500
At the very least,

30:36.800 --> 30:39.100
you must know you're putting
your future on the line.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.300
Why did you do it?

30:41.500 --> 30:43.300
Same reason you and your
bosses are working

30:43.335 --> 30:45.000
so hard to cover it up.

30:46.300 --> 30:47.600
Because he's earned that.

30:48.900 --> 30:50.300
Because it's the
right thing to do.

30:50.335 --> 30:51.400
Because I was asked.

30:52.800 --> 30:55.400
You make it sound like
a privilege, fudging the truth.

30:56.300 --> 30:59.100
Maybe I've been in politics
too long, but yes,

31:00.300 --> 31:02.200
I consider it an honor

31:02.600 --> 31:04.700
to be asked to help a great man

31:04.735 --> 31:06.500
maintain his dignity at a moment

31:06.535 --> 31:08.600
when he doesn't have the
strength tdo it for himself.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.100
So you really admired him?

31:11.800 --> 31:13.700
I like to think
I understood him.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.600
You know, with all
he accomplished,

31:16.635 --> 31:19.400
Henry Rykoff was actually

31:19.435 --> 31:22.800
a very lonely and
disconnected man.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.400
But I'll tell you something,
when I was a kid,

31:25.900 --> 31:27.500
when I was constantly
being told

31:27.535 --> 31:30.800
that I was not the smartest boy
in the room or the best-looking

31:30.835 --> 31:32.300
or the strongest
or the fastest,

31:32.335 --> 31:34.200
Henry Rykoff--
and I don't know why--

31:34.900 --> 31:36.300
was the first adult to sayto me "Y

31:36.335 --> 31:40.300
"There's a future for you
if you want it,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.600
if you're willing
to work for it."

31:42.635 --> 31:44.300
He wrote letters
of recommendation

31:44.335 --> 31:45.700
to get me into school,

31:46.300 --> 31:47.700
loaned my mom money
for tuition,

31:47.735 --> 31:48.700
and when I graduated,

31:48.735 --> 31:50.700
he immediately took me
under his wing,

31:51.700 --> 31:53.200
made me part of his staff.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.100
Why?

31:57.300 --> 32:01.300
I think he sensed I might
have been a bit lonely,

32:01.335 --> 32:04.100
a bit disconnected, too.

32:36.700 --> 32:37.400
Jim!

32:39.200 --> 32:40.100
Jimmy...

32:41.100 --> 32:42.000
You okay?

32:42.800 --> 32:44.700
No, I'm not okay!

32:45.700 --> 32:47.100
I don't feel good!

32:47.700 --> 32:48.900
I feel sick!

32:49.000 --> 32:51.600
And now I'm going to get in
trouble for skipping school.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.100
And I think you
and that old guy,

32:54.600 --> 32:56.400
I think you're a couple
of pervs.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.500
What are you talking about?

32:57.535 --> 32:59.200
You know what I'm talking about!

33:00.800 --> 33:02.900
How'd my clothes
get off of me?!

33:03.300 --> 33:04.400
You wanted to swim.

33:04.435 --> 33:07.400
No, I didn't!
I don't even know how to swim!

33:09.900 --> 33:11.200
I feel so sick.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.300
I need my mom.

33:13.900 --> 33:16.100
You're a perv and that
other guy's a perv.

33:16.700 --> 33:17.900
And I'm telling my mom.

33:17.935 --> 33:19.800
You put something in my soda.

33:19.835 --> 33:21.700
Nobody's telling
anybody anything.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.100
You understand?

33:24.200 --> 33:26.500
Nobody is telling anybody
anything.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.200
Now you sit back down

33:28.235 --> 33:30.300
and I promise you
you'll feel better soon.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.000
I'm going home.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.000
And I'm telling...
No, you're not!

33:37.600 --> 33:38.800
Now don't be stupid.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.200
You're not going anywhere.

33:41.235 --> 33:42.700
Not until you calm down.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.300
What do you think you're
gonna say to your mother?

33:50.400 --> 33:51.800
Do you know who
that old guy was?

33:52.200 --> 33:53.600
Do you know how important he is?

34:07.800 --> 34:08.699
There!

34:19.100 --> 34:20.000
What are you doing?

34:20.300 --> 34:21.500
I'm getting my bike.

34:21.900 --> 34:22.900
Getting your bike?

34:23.400 --> 34:23.900
What are you, nuts?

34:23.935 --> 34:26.600
You can't even see the bottom of...
Shut up! I'm getting it.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.699
You don't seem to be
making much progress.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.000
This was dumb.
Help me out.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.699
What, so you can
run home to Mommy and tell her all kinds of lies?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.500
Just help me out.
Give me your hand.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.699
What are you going
to tell Mommy?

34:38.900 --> 34:40.300
Just give me your hand!

34:43.199 --> 34:44.300
Swear to...

34:44.335 --> 34:45.500
Oh...

34:45.800 --> 34:47.300
Jimmy!

34:50.800 --> 34:52.100
Jimmy!

34:54.800 --> 34:56.199
He's dead.

34:56.800 --> 34:57.700
What?

34:58.700 --> 34:59.900
These are his books.

35:00.900 --> 35:02.200
They're the only thing left.

35:03.600 --> 35:04.400
He fell.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.300
I mean, he was climbing
because I threw his bike

35:07.335 --> 35:09.600
and he asked me for help,
but I-I couldn't help.

35:09.635 --> 35:10.900
Put those in here.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.100
Casey... my Casey.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.100
Casey.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.000
CASEY:
So, how can I be of help?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.700
As you may or may
not be aware,

35:37.735 --> 35:40.100
when we recovered
Jimmy Nessler's remains

35:40.135 --> 35:40.900
earlier in the week

35:40.935 --> 35:42.400
from the bottom
of that living cave

35:42.435 --> 35:45.200
we also recovered
some other artifacts

35:45.235 --> 35:47.300
that apparently
had been down there

35:47.335 --> 35:49.300
as long as he had.
Okay...

35:49.800 --> 35:52.800
A bicycle, that
apparently was his,

35:52.835 --> 35:55.800
some microscopic
bits of fiber

35:55.835 --> 35:58.600
that we believe is all
that's left of his clothes

35:58.635 --> 36:00.000
after 15 years
in the elements,

36:00.035 --> 36:02.300
and a Saint Christopher's medal.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.300
This is all fascinating, but...

36:06.335 --> 36:08.200
The back of the medal was
engraved with the initials

36:08.235 --> 36:09.500
"C-E-F."

36:09.700 --> 36:11.400
Those are your initials,
aren't they?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.300
Casey Edward Frank.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.800
Also the date,
11-15-74.

36:16.835 --> 36:18.100
That's your birthday.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.000
So you're suggesting...?

36:20.035 --> 36:23.200
That perhaps it might
just be your medal.

36:24.200 --> 36:26.000
Okay, I'll concede that.
It just might be.

36:26.900 --> 36:27.900
What's the point?

36:27.935 --> 36:28.800
No point.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.300
Not a big one anyway.

36:30.335 --> 36:32.500
Just that, you told Mrs. Dubois

36:32.535 --> 36:34.000
only yesterday
that you really didn't know

36:34.035 --> 36:35.900
the Nessler boy,
not personally.

36:35.935 --> 36:38.300
And I didn't. Did I play
near those caves?

36:38.800 --> 36:39.900
Horse around there?

36:40.200 --> 36:41.700
Sure. Everyone did.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.500
Is it possible that I
dropped or lost my medal?

36:45.900 --> 36:48.000
Sure. Where are you
going with this?

36:48.035 --> 36:49.100
Not going anywhere.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.300
Just, now that you're going
to be running for public office,

36:52.335 --> 36:54.600
now that you're going to be

36:54.635 --> 36:56.400
under some scrutiny,
we just want to give you

36:56.435 --> 36:57.900
a chance to revise
your statement

36:58.300 --> 36:59.800
with regard to how
well you knew

36:59.835 --> 37:02.600
the Nessler boy,
if... you chose to.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.700
I don't need
to revise my statement.

37:04.735 --> 37:06.000
I stand by what I said.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.200
Are we through here?

37:09.235 --> 37:11.400
Just one more thing,
uh, as you know I'm...

37:12.200 --> 37:13.900
working to get the coroner

37:13.935 --> 37:16.800
to issue a death certificate
for Assemblyman Rykoff

37:16.835 --> 37:18.600
that would indicate he
died of natural causes,

37:18.635 --> 37:20.200
and I almost had
him there, but...

37:20.900 --> 37:23.200
then he realized that
the trauma to the back

37:23.235 --> 37:24.300
of the assemblyman's neck

37:24.335 --> 37:26.800
was as severe as the trauma
to the front.

37:27.600 --> 37:28.400
I'm sorry.

37:28.435 --> 37:32.400
You're losing me.
If a man wereto hang himself,

37:32.500 --> 37:34.300
even if it
was only a botched attempt

37:34.335 --> 37:35.900
to heighten sexual sensation,

37:36.300 --> 37:38.600
the trauma would only occur
to the front of the neck--

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
the place where the noose
and the throat meet.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.400
It would take someone coming up
from behind the assemblyman,

37:45.100 --> 37:46.600
strangling him with great force,

37:46.635 --> 37:48.700
to create the kind of trauma
apparent at the back

37:48.735 --> 37:49.800
of the neck.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.600
Wh... what are you saying?
We're saying that

37:53.635 --> 37:55.900
it appears that someone
murdered Henry Rykoff,

37:55.935 --> 37:57.500
then staged it to make it
look as though

37:57.535 --> 37:59.400
he accidentally
caused his own death.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.000
And you think
that someone is me.

38:08.035 --> 38:09.100
With any murder case,

38:09.135 --> 38:11.400
we look for means,
motive and opportunity.

38:11.435 --> 38:13.100
You certainly
had the means.

38:13.135 --> 38:15.000
You have the physical
strength to strangle

38:15.035 --> 38:17.400
the assemblyman and lift
him into that noose.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
You had the opportunity.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.900
We're very
aware that you

38:20.935 --> 38:22.600
had a key
to the Rykoff residence

38:22.635 --> 38:25.700
along with their alarm codes,
that you frequently took care

38:25.735 --> 38:27.300
of their home
when they were away.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.200
And as far as the motive,

38:29.500 --> 38:31.300
congratulations
on running unopposed

38:31.335 --> 38:33.100
to fill the assemblyman's seat.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.400
That's absurd. This
whole thing's absurd

38:36.200 --> 38:39.200
Everyone knew I was being
groomed as Henry's successor.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.700
Everyone knew he was
planning to retire

38:40.735 --> 38:43.600
after this term.
Do you honestly believe

38:43.800 --> 38:45.600
I would kill a man
to take something

38:45.635 --> 38:48.000
he was prepared to give me
a year and a half from now?

38:49.200 --> 38:50.400
I'm going to remember
this moment,

38:50.435 --> 38:51.800
Mr. District Attorney.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.500
When I'm sitting in the
state capital building

38:54.535 --> 38:56.000
staring at your budget,

38:56.700 --> 38:58.600
contemplating anything
to do with you

38:58.635 --> 39:01.100
or your office, I will
remember this moment.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.800
I thought you were
a smart man.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.300
I thought you were smart people.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.200
But smart people don't make
absurd allegations.

39:08.235 --> 39:10.500
And they certainly don't
make absurd allegations

39:10.535 --> 39:11.600
they can't prove.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.200
I'll see myself out.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.600
He's right. We can't
prove a damn thing and he knows it.
(sighing)

39:24.300 --> 39:25.400
ALLISON:
I know what happened.

39:25.435 --> 39:27.500
I know who did it.
I just can't prove it.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And I'm never
going to be able to.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.900
Well, you know
what you need?

39:34.200 --> 39:35.600
A good night's sleep.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.300
Trust me. Just
close your eyes,

39:38.600 --> 39:41.300
get some rest and
everything will look better in the morning.
(groaning)

39:41.800 --> 39:43.100
That's easy for you to say.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.400
You're right.
In fact, I think I'll say it again.

39:45.435 --> 39:46.200
Close your eyes...

39:46.235 --> 39:47.800
Shut up.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.300
CASEY:
Hey, you wanted to see me?

39:55.100 --> 39:56.800
Casey, my Casey.

39:57.300 --> 39:58.700
Thanks for coming over, um...

40:06.200 --> 40:08.000
I've been thinking a lot
about the plans we made,

40:08.035 --> 40:08.700
my...

40:09.200 --> 40:11.200
not running this term,
endorsing you.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.100
Truth is, I just don't
think I can do it.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.400
What?

40:19.100 --> 40:20.200
I'm gonna run again.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.400
And I'd very much
like your help.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.300
Are you forgetting
I know things?

40:28.900 --> 40:31.600
I know things that would
make it very difficult

40:31.635 --> 40:33.100
for you to get reelected.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.500
That's a silly threat,
young man.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.700
You know things.

40:38.700 --> 40:41.200
And everything you know about me
involves you, too.

40:42.400 --> 40:43.200
So while you might
be able

40:43.235 --> 40:45.600
to tarnish me at the end
of my career,

40:45.635 --> 40:47.400
you'll destroy your own
in the process.

40:47.435 --> 40:48.900
Well, I might do it anyway.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.800
I don't want to wait
another four years.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.800
I can't.
You can.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.500
And you will.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.700
Now let's not forget
who has what on whom.

41:01.400 --> 41:02.800
You have nothing on me.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.000
I'm the victim in all this.

41:06.300 --> 41:07.700
That's not the way
I see it.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.700
The Nessler boy's book bag.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.600
Covered with your
fingerprints all over it.

41:19.900 --> 41:21.600
Maybe not enough to prove
you killed him,

41:22.800 --> 41:25.400
but you'd certainly have
a lot of questions to answer.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.800
So... let's calm down.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.100
It's only four more years.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.600
And who knows?

41:36.100 --> 41:37.300
Maybe you'll get lucky.

41:37.900 --> 41:39.300
I could die in office.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.100
Everything okay?
Everything's fine.

41:48.900 --> 41:50.000
Everything's great.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
You were right.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.000
I closed my eyes
and suddenly

41:53.035 --> 41:54.100
everything was better.

41:54.600 --> 41:55.600
Who are you calling?

41:55.800 --> 41:57.000
A locksmith I know.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.900
Sorry to wake you,
Mr. District Attorney.

42:01.100 --> 42:01.900
Uh...

42:02.300 --> 42:05.500
there's a safe that you
and I need to crack right now.
