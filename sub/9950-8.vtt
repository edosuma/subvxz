WEBVTT

00:00.299 --> 00:03.578
Look at me, right?
And look at the Queen.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.971
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:07.046 --> 00:08.724
me and Ma'am have in common -

00:08.726 --> 00:11.084
bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:11.086 --> 00:13.284
I know she's not a single parent,

00:13.286 --> 00:15.124
but she might as well be. Plus,

00:15.126 --> 00:17.524
the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:17.526 --> 00:19.044
her literally sometimes,

00:19.046 --> 00:21.284
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:21.286 --> 00:23.764
Admired and despised equally.

00:23.766 --> 00:25.804
Not for never lifting a finger, no,

00:25.806 --> 00:28.964
for setting examples
through extremity.

00:28.966 --> 00:31.364
And whether you're a bigwig
on her end or a bigwig on mine,

00:31.366 --> 00:34.044
you've still got all your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:34.046 --> 00:35.804
snip, snip, snipping
at your benefits.

00:35.806 --> 00:38.724
I mean, she can't not be looking
at me and thinking,

00:38.726 --> 00:40.764
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:40.766 --> 00:43.644
I got shot of my kids yonks back,

00:43.646 --> 00:46.084
whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.086 --> 00:49.004
Fine! I've had to get out of bed
on occasion to make ends meet,

00:49.006 --> 00:53.006
whereas she... she's done
the whole thing from a chair.

00:53.886 --> 00:55.724
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:55.726 --> 00:57.604
Oh, sure, there's perks.

00:57.606 --> 00:58.764
But, look at her lot.

00:58.766 --> 01:01.204
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:01.206 --> 01:07.629
Now, look at my lot... we know how
to throw a proper fucking paaaarty!

01:15.239 --> 01:18.957
It's not that hard being
a parent in the modern world.

01:18.959 --> 01:21.277
It's not like the caveman times.

01:21.279 --> 01:24.759
Back then you'd be protecting
your kids from rampaging tribesmen

01:24.842 --> 01:27.840
and sabre-toothed tigers.

01:27.842 --> 01:31.240
Or the medieval ages, where if
infant mortality didn't snatch the

01:31.242 --> 01:35.242
little buggers off, then the black
death were hammering on the door.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.520
Nah, now it's easier.

01:38.522 --> 01:41.120
Sure you have to make
a few sacrifices,

01:41.122 --> 01:42.722
but it's nothing like the past.

01:42.790 --> 01:46.148
As long as you have a bit of spare
cash to buy them clothes and shit,

01:46.150 --> 01:50.150
make sure there's
food on the table...

01:50.790 --> 01:54.790
..and be there for them
when they need it, you're sorted.

01:55.670 --> 01:59.670
Basically, don't be a knobhead
and yer'll be fine.

02:16.510 --> 02:20.510
It's not some big mystery, is it?

02:20.790 --> 02:24.790
So how come so many
of the twats fuck it up, eh?

02:37.030 --> 02:38.788
Oi! Hands off.

02:38.790 --> 02:40.508
Just looking.

02:40.510 --> 02:41.668
Just touching!

02:41.670 --> 02:43.268
You running away from home?

02:43.270 --> 02:45.588
Overnight excursions
with the Scouts.

02:45.590 --> 02:47.348
Pitch a tent,

02:47.350 --> 02:51.350
build a fire,
underneath that old wandering star.

02:51.790 --> 02:52.828
Can I come?

02:52.830 --> 02:53.948
You're not a Scout.

02:53.950 --> 02:55.988
I could be one.
Never been in a tent.

02:55.990 --> 02:59.990
Or built a fire.
Or seen a wandering star.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.668
I've got Billy doing
the school pics for me.

03:44.670 --> 03:48.670
There's a class set,
individual pics and a family group.

03:49.070 --> 03:51.348
Doesn't matter how bleeding ugly
the kids are,

03:51.350 --> 03:53.108
the parents'll buy the lot.

03:53.110 --> 03:54.948
Pint, please, Karen.

03:54.950 --> 03:58.668
Eh, Gallagher, you'll need a sick
note for skipping work today.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.228
I was mugged.

04:00.230 --> 04:01.308
Who'd mug you?

04:01.310 --> 04:04.828
They took the lot. I didn't even have
the bus fare to get back home.

04:04.830 --> 04:07.908
Don't care. Â£2.50.

04:07.910 --> 04:09.868
Muggers took you for a trip
out, did they?

04:09.870 --> 04:11.268
From the hospital.

04:11.270 --> 04:13.988
Hang on. You left here
last night with fuck all.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.948
You still owe me for six pints
and two Es.

04:15.950 --> 04:19.950
So clear your tab or no more.

04:20.070 --> 04:24.070
Fine. Mimi, payday's not till...
y'know, any chance...?

04:24.190 --> 04:25.228
End of the month.

04:25.230 --> 04:28.988
Oh, fine! Abandoned. An outcast.

04:28.990 --> 04:32.628
Oh, God! Who's going to look
after you in your old age?

04:32.630 --> 04:34.148
I've still got my dignity.

04:34.150 --> 04:38.108
Whoa, pal, that's mine now.
Get off, you baghead, get off!

04:38.110 --> 04:42.110
Get off!

04:42.790 --> 04:46.790
Dignity my arse.

04:56.030 --> 05:00.030
Hiya!

05:00.270 --> 05:02.548
G'us your bag then.
Good day at the office?

05:02.550 --> 05:06.388
Yeah.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.468
Why not...? It's just Scouts.

05:08.470 --> 05:09.788
"It's just Scouts!"

05:09.790 --> 05:10.828
Shut up!

05:10.830 --> 05:14.830
It's sinister! Making you dress all
the same, act the same way.

05:15.230 --> 05:18.908
Little robots with woggles.
You'll thank me one day.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.148
I just want you kids to be,
y'know...

05:21.150 --> 05:22.188
Individuals.

05:22.190 --> 05:23.348
To follow your own path.

05:23.350 --> 05:25.068
Dance to the beat of your drum.

05:25.070 --> 05:28.708
OK. But... I'm still right.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.468
But I know the path
I want to follow,

05:30.470 --> 05:32.788
I want to be a Scout!

05:32.790 --> 05:36.790
"I want to be a Scout!"

05:40.230 --> 05:43.308
But please, Dad!

05:43.310 --> 05:44.468
Lip!

05:44.470 --> 05:45.508
Frank.

05:45.510 --> 05:49.148
Not your neck of the woods.

05:49.150 --> 05:52.548
Call it fate. Kismet.

05:52.550 --> 05:54.908
So you're looking good - suit, tie.

05:54.910 --> 05:56.348
It's called having a job, Frank.

05:56.350 --> 05:59.988
Architect. For the council.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.588
And we're in a bit of a hurry.

06:01.590 --> 06:03.348
Those buildings
won't build themselves.

06:03.350 --> 06:06.268
I've seen you before. On the bus.

06:06.270 --> 06:07.868
I thought you were a boy.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.268
Thank you.

06:09.270 --> 06:11.868
Eh, what'd we say
about talking to strangers?

06:11.870 --> 06:15.108
And there's no-one more strange
than your old grandad, eh, Katie?

06:15.110 --> 06:17.508
No way!

06:17.510 --> 06:19.068
It's a miracle?!

06:19.070 --> 06:21.148
Well... wouldn't go that far.

06:21.150 --> 06:23.988
It is. We thought the Taliban'd
never let you go.

06:23.990 --> 06:25.748
Yes, Grandad.

06:25.750 --> 06:29.750
We didn't know
if you was dead or alive.

06:32.950 --> 06:36.908
Grandad, watch!

06:36.910 --> 06:39.508
Oh, yeah, brilliant, kid, brilliant!

06:39.510 --> 06:42.428
How much?

06:42.430 --> 06:44.548
For you to piss off
and leave us alone.

06:44.550 --> 06:47.348
That's no way to speak
to a war hero.

06:47.350 --> 06:49.068
Go on. Take it.

06:49.070 --> 06:52.508
Piss off back down the Jockey,
go and have yourself some fun.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.028
Don't bother coming back round
these ways ever again.

06:55.030 --> 06:56.948
Oh. You do live round here then?

06:56.950 --> 07:00.950
Just visiting. Work.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.228
I'm not after your money.

07:06.230 --> 07:09.548
What, is it so far-fetched
that I might miss my grandson...

07:09.550 --> 07:10.588
daughter?

07:10.590 --> 07:13.628
About as far-fetched as Liverpool
or Santa Claus winning

07:13.630 --> 07:15.228
the bloody Premier League.

07:15.230 --> 07:19.028
As far-fetched as me being
captured by the Taliban then?

07:19.030 --> 07:23.030
Course, the SAS are dying to recruit
blokes like me, y'know.

07:23.190 --> 07:24.828
Catering staff.

07:24.830 --> 07:26.988
You were Army catering staff.

07:26.990 --> 07:29.108
You got kidnapped by mistake.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.228
The Taliban were
so fucking embarrassed

07:31.230 --> 07:33.708
they didn't know what
to do with you.

07:33.710 --> 07:35.148
You see, Frank?

07:35.150 --> 07:39.150
Even in the silliest little lie,
I told my daughter...

07:39.350 --> 07:43.350
you're still a loser.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.908
Fair enough.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.148
Katie!

07:52.150 --> 07:55.588
Your dad wants to know if you want
to come back to mine, for dinner -

07:55.590 --> 07:56.828
fish and chips!

07:56.830 --> 07:59.068
Brilliant, kid, brilliant!

07:59.070 --> 08:01.628
D'you hear that?! Eh?

08:01.630 --> 08:03.428
Out of the mouths of babes.

08:03.430 --> 08:06.028
You might want to stop
off at the cash machine, y'know,

08:06.030 --> 08:10.030
price of a fish supper
nowadays and all that...

08:12.990 --> 08:16.148
You all right, Frank?

08:16.150 --> 08:20.150
Frank?

08:40.110 --> 08:42.388
Don't just stand there,
place won't clean itself.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.148
God, I've got to do
everything myself.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.908
Didn't know the Social were coming.

08:45.910 --> 08:47.468
They're not. It's Lip.

08:47.470 --> 08:49.308
Lip, like my brother Lip?

08:49.310 --> 08:52.348
Yes. He who never visits.
Him and his kid, Katie.

08:52.350 --> 08:53.588
They'll be here in a minute.

08:53.590 --> 08:54.628
What's up?

08:54.630 --> 08:57.508
And if asked, I've been away,
locked up by the Taliban.

08:57.510 --> 08:59.148
Frank. What have you done now?

08:59.150 --> 09:01.548
Not me. It's Lip, it's his story.

09:01.550 --> 09:04.268
He's had me Terry Waite-d up
in some far-flung land.

09:04.270 --> 09:08.270
Why would he say that?

09:08.630 --> 09:12.630
I dunno. Takes all sorts, I suppose.

09:14.950 --> 09:18.950
Right, go to mine, get coffee,
not a jar, the good Yemeni stuff.

09:20.630 --> 09:24.630
It's the only thing strong enough
to cover up this stench!

09:26.870 --> 09:28.148
Is he nice?

09:28.150 --> 09:31.828
He's got a heart of gold.

09:31.830 --> 09:35.468
I'm sure if you remind him
of all the birthdays

09:35.470 --> 09:38.708
and Christmases that he's missed,
y'know, he might, y'know...

09:38.710 --> 09:42.710
give us... give you... a little
something for your piggy bank.

09:51.310 --> 09:53.588
Hey, Jamie, I'm in training.

09:53.590 --> 09:54.948
Oh, yeah, what for?

09:54.950 --> 09:57.228
Camping. I got in the Scouts.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.428
I have to carry my own tent.

09:59.430 --> 10:02.748
What's your first mission then?

10:02.750 --> 10:05.228
Climbing Everest or
surviving the Sahara?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.268
Remona's taking us to a field.

10:07.270 --> 10:08.668
Ooh, how exciting!

10:08.670 --> 10:11.028
Y'know this bag's dead heavy?

10:11.030 --> 10:12.668
I believe you, mate.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.668
Uncle Jamie,
were you ever in the Scouts?

10:14.670 --> 10:17.868
Me and our Shane chucked fireworks
at the Scout hall once.

10:17.870 --> 10:19.268
About as close as I got.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.868
I don't think they could
handle your Uncle Jamie.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.108
What do you mean?

10:23.110 --> 10:27.110
I'm more of a leader...
than a follower!

10:37.950 --> 10:40.428
What was it like here
when you were little?

10:40.430 --> 10:44.430
It was nice.

10:54.790 --> 10:58.508
Fucking rats!

10:58.510 --> 11:01.428
It's not very nice now.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.268
Places change, sweetheart.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.068
So, why does Grandad stay here?

11:05.070 --> 11:08.588
The country doesn't look after war
veterans as well as it should do.

11:08.590 --> 11:10.028
It's a shame for Grandad.

11:10.030 --> 11:14.030
Yeah, a real shame.

11:18.870 --> 11:22.870
Dad?

11:36.030 --> 11:38.708
Eh, come in!

11:38.710 --> 11:42.710
Welcome home.

11:50.190 --> 11:51.588
Hi, I'm Esther.

11:51.590 --> 11:53.468
Oh. Are you, uh..?

11:53.470 --> 11:56.148
God, no... Next door,
just the neighbour.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.068
And besides,
I'm totally out of his league.

11:58.070 --> 12:02.070
This is... thingy, a stray
we've acquired along the way.

12:02.270 --> 12:06.270
Aiden. Pleased to meet you,
sir. Allow me.

12:08.670 --> 12:12.670
And Stella. Your sister.

12:18.110 --> 12:19.188
Hello.

12:19.190 --> 12:22.548
It's really nice to meet you.
Sorry it's taken so long.

12:22.550 --> 12:24.750
Dad said you'll give me
a little money.

12:26.910 --> 12:29.988
Where do they get this stuff, eh?

12:29.990 --> 12:33.748
Well, it must run in the family.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.628
So, how does it feel to be home?

12:35.630 --> 12:38.468
'I've asked you ten times
before, Gallagher...'

12:38.470 --> 12:39.708
Nana?!

12:39.710 --> 12:41.588
Katie. Wait, please...

12:41.590 --> 12:45.108
..and none
of your half-hearted forgeries!

12:45.110 --> 12:47.228
What are you doing here, sweetheart?

12:47.230 --> 12:51.230
I'm not due to see you till next
week. What's going on, Lip?

12:53.470 --> 12:55.628
Oh, just back for the job, is it?

12:55.630 --> 12:57.908
Dad...

12:57.910 --> 13:01.508
Please. For Katie.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.668
Happy families.
With her, Granny Shankly?

13:03.670 --> 13:04.988
She's better than me?

13:04.990 --> 13:06.028
Don't.

13:06.030 --> 13:08.348
You never told me
you lived near Grandad!

13:08.350 --> 13:09.988
No, I didn't, because...

13:09.990 --> 13:11.268
The Taliban?

13:11.270 --> 13:15.270
Yeah, those fellas.

13:15.310 --> 13:18.108
Well, you know...

13:18.110 --> 13:22.110
Maybe it's time we told the truth.

13:22.670 --> 13:26.670
Gallaghers' name stands
for something, doesn't it? Integrity.

13:26.870 --> 13:30.870
Honesty.

13:31.950 --> 13:33.068
Look, love.

13:33.070 --> 13:34.748
Look.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.988
I was never captured by the Taliban.

13:37.990 --> 13:38.868
But Dad...

13:38.870 --> 13:40.388
No, no, it's not your dad's fault.

13:40.390 --> 13:44.390
Couldn't tell anyone the story.

13:45.350 --> 13:48.068
I was on a mission.

13:48.070 --> 13:52.070
To find a man, a very bad man.

13:52.230 --> 13:56.230
Do you know who Osama bin Laden is?

13:57.190 --> 14:01.190
Grandad!

14:01.310 --> 14:02.457
Yeah.

14:02.556 --> 14:04.296
Bin Laden.

14:04.560 --> 14:05.838
Seriously?

14:05.840 --> 14:08.638
You started it
with your tall tales of the Taliban.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.358
How long do you think she's going
to buy into that hero bullshit?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.800
Dunno. You believed in
the Tooth Fairy till you were 11.

14:13.911 --> 14:14.949
Fuck off.

14:14.951 --> 14:17.709
And you wet the bed. Or shall
I just tell her the real truth?

14:17.711 --> 14:19.109
Her dad's a big fat liar.

14:19.111 --> 14:20.149
One more word...

14:20.151 --> 14:23.189
One more word from either of you,
and I'll be cracking skulls.

14:23.191 --> 14:26.669
You're not ruining this for me.
It's good you're here though-

14:26.671 --> 14:28.069
Yeah. Fantastic.

14:28.071 --> 14:29.309
Cos it's nearly done.

14:29.311 --> 14:32.709
I'll nip next door and get it
while she's still playing.

14:32.711 --> 14:35.789
Cilla, come on, babe.

14:35.791 --> 14:39.791
Pop home.

14:41.431 --> 14:44.549
What treat is Super Gran
looking to spring?

14:44.551 --> 14:48.029
She's altering Mandy's old Communion
dress for Katie's confirmation.

14:48.031 --> 14:49.309
It means a lot to her.

14:49.311 --> 14:51.709
How does she get her trotters
to hold the little needles?

14:51.711 --> 14:55.149
If that's the way she chooses
to grieve, who am I to stop her?

14:55.151 --> 14:59.151
My invitation must have got lost,
so let me RSVP in person.

15:02.231 --> 15:05.629
If you're offering.

15:05.631 --> 15:07.051
But you can't be my auntie.

15:07.084 --> 15:07.922
But I am.

15:07.924 --> 15:09.202
But you're younger than me.

15:09.204 --> 15:13.002
Cilla's your auntie
as well you know. D'you live nearby?

15:13.004 --> 15:16.642
Took us four buses to get here.

15:16.644 --> 15:19.722
Hey, I know the transport system's
fucked but you're only ten minutes away.

15:19.724 --> 15:21.042
I took her the long way round,

15:21.044 --> 15:24.242
so she knows exactly how far
away Grandad lives.

15:24.244 --> 15:25.762
So enjoy it while it lasts.

15:25.764 --> 15:29.764
Because we're a long way from home.

15:46.884 --> 15:50.884
I don't know what this whole
bad ass routine is about, Blanco.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.522
But it doesn't suit you.

15:52.524 --> 15:55.442
Maybe I don't want to be
like everyone else.

15:55.444 --> 15:59.444
Go and get the rest of your uniform!

16:06.844 --> 16:08.642
Did they torture you?

16:08.644 --> 16:12.362
They did unspeakable things.

16:12.364 --> 16:13.522
Like what?

16:13.524 --> 16:15.562
You're a right little tom boy,
aren't you?

16:15.564 --> 16:17.402
No, she's not. It's a phase.

16:17.404 --> 16:19.962
Maybe if her gran was allowed
to spend more time with her,

16:19.964 --> 16:21.962
she wouldn't feel the need
to act up so much.

16:21.964 --> 16:23.002
She's not acting up!

16:23.004 --> 16:25.282
Really? When did she last wear
a dress? Make-up?

16:25.284 --> 16:26.322
Not this again...

16:26.324 --> 16:28.602
For God's sake, she hasn't even got
her ears pierced.

16:28.604 --> 16:30.682
- She's nine, y'know.
- I think we best be getting back.

16:30.684 --> 16:33.802
Sit down, there's no rush.
I'll put the kettle on.

16:33.804 --> 16:35.122
Katie.

16:35.124 --> 16:38.364
Tell your dad how you're glad to
spend a little more time with gran.

16:39.484 --> 16:41.482
And your granddad.

16:41.484 --> 16:45.484
Please, Dad, can we? Please? Please?

16:45.604 --> 16:48.522
Course you can. You can visit
any time you want.

16:48.524 --> 16:52.524
Now that your grandad's home.

16:55.804 --> 16:59.482
Granny Maguire seems pretty
determined to keep you here.

16:59.484 --> 17:00.802
She's got an agenda, that one.

17:00.804 --> 17:02.002
And you don't?

17:02.004 --> 17:04.041
Eh, I'm on your side.

17:04.044 --> 17:05.602
You have never been on my side.

17:05.604 --> 17:07.321
Oh, y'know what,
just go and take a walk,

17:07.324 --> 17:09.882
cool down or you'll blow
a fucking gasket,

17:09.884 --> 17:12.602
and you don't want to do that in
front of your kids. Messes 'em up.

17:12.604 --> 17:15.922
You're giving me parenting advice?

17:15.924 --> 17:18.801
Katie, darling, your dad's going
to have to stretch his legs, love.

17:18.804 --> 17:22.122
You'll be alright here with Stella.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.124
Pick us up forty fags
while you're out.

17:29.364 --> 17:30.962
No broken home to go back to?

17:30.964 --> 17:34.964
Fuck off, paedo.

17:36.044 --> 17:39.002
Bad news, my little Bandita.

17:39.004 --> 17:42.802
Permission for take off's
been denied.

17:42.804 --> 17:46.804
No, I've got the money,
it's my time that's being pillaged.

17:47.804 --> 17:50.762
Me son's coming round,
just invited himself without any

17:50.764 --> 17:52.322
thought how it might disrupt my day.

17:52.324 --> 17:56.324
You know how selfish kids can be.
Yeah. I'll call to reschedule.

17:58.484 --> 18:02.484
Will you two stop that?
Or I'll kick your fucking heads in.

18:07.364 --> 18:11.162
I mean it, Gallagher.
Don't you mess this up for me.

18:11.164 --> 18:15.164
You're the ones built your little
Sylvanian Family on sand.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.442
Whose fault is that?

18:17.444 --> 18:21.444
I only get to see her every few
weeks because Lip can't stand you.

18:21.724 --> 18:24.642
You have poisoned
that boy's mind against me.

18:24.644 --> 18:26.282
We used to be like that.

18:26.284 --> 18:30.042
Really? So you've been sending him
cash, have you?

18:30.044 --> 18:32.762
To help him
take care of his little one,

18:32.764 --> 18:36.764
each week, into a special account?

18:36.924 --> 18:37.962
Thought not.

18:37.964 --> 18:40.602
He should be taking care of me
in my advancing years.

18:40.604 --> 18:44.604
He's got enough problems bringing
Katie up, you selfish fuck.

18:46.404 --> 18:49.042
Come on, Slater,
we're waiting on that water.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.642
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!

18:52.644 --> 18:56.442
Put some elbow grease in it!

18:56.444 --> 18:58.922
This is no holiday camp,
this is the Scouts!

18:58.924 --> 19:02.924
Come on, guys, seriously!
It'll be cool!

19:04.164 --> 19:07.402
Is it ready? We can't eat
till the billy cans are ready.

19:07.404 --> 19:09.162
Get them in, get them in!

19:09.164 --> 19:12.082
Out the way, out the way!

19:12.084 --> 19:16.084
It's all right, don't panic.

19:16.404 --> 19:17.882
You, Blanco!

19:17.884 --> 19:19.202
You!

19:19.204 --> 19:23.204
Oh, shit.

19:33.684 --> 19:35.522
Fuck me.

19:35.524 --> 19:37.602
Is that still
your best chat up line?

19:37.604 --> 19:40.282
Fails every time.
What are you doing here?

19:40.284 --> 19:44.002
Right now,
avoiding my piss-soaked dad.

19:44.004 --> 19:45.402
The rest is a long story.

19:45.404 --> 19:46.202
Coming in?

19:46.204 --> 19:47.922
Nah, you're all right.

19:47.924 --> 19:49.162
Where you going then?

19:49.164 --> 19:50.442
Generally?

19:50.444 --> 19:52.162
Come on.

19:52.164 --> 19:56.164
I'll buy you a pint if you promise
not to share and care.

19:56.284 --> 19:58.002
Come on,

19:58.004 --> 20:00.282
warm beer, shit company,
bad entertainment...

20:00.284 --> 20:03.562
Don't pretend you haven't
missed it, mate.

20:03.564 --> 20:07.564
As long as you're paying.

20:27.564 --> 20:31.564
You seen Coggsy?

20:34.524 --> 20:36.002
I know I'm good looking,

20:36.004 --> 20:38.282
but you shouldn't be staring
at your punters.

20:38.284 --> 20:40.762
Lip Gallagher, all grown up.

20:40.764 --> 20:42.442
Did you start shopping at Next?

20:42.444 --> 20:45.842
You know me,
always was a bit of class.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.162
And always full of it.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.762
So you're doing OK I can see.

20:48.764 --> 20:50.442
It's the spirit of Chatsworth.

20:50.444 --> 20:52.762
It'd take more than a global
recession to stop this lot

20:52.764 --> 20:55.002
having a good time. Pint?

20:55.004 --> 20:59.004
Yeah.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.362
Her husband?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.042
Mimi never said 'owt.

21:06.044 --> 21:08.282
She probably worries
you'd judge her.

21:08.284 --> 21:10.762
Some people do you know,
cos of the age gap.

21:10.764 --> 21:12.162
S'not for me to say.

21:12.164 --> 21:14.202
But, don't you think it's a bit...

21:14.204 --> 21:15.522
oedipal?

21:15.524 --> 21:19.524
Edible?

21:19.884 --> 21:21.642
Come to me.

21:21.644 --> 21:24.722
Easy, Lillian, people'll be...

21:24.724 --> 21:26.002
talking.

21:26.004 --> 21:28.202
Well, you always did have a way
with the ladies.

21:28.204 --> 21:32.204
Never lose it.

21:35.924 --> 21:38.962
There you go,

21:38.964 --> 21:41.162
Isn't she a pretty little girl?

21:41.164 --> 21:42.602
She's fine as she was.

21:42.604 --> 21:43.642
Do you think so?

21:43.644 --> 21:47.644
Your grandad's busy watching
his show right now... Isn't he?

21:49.804 --> 21:53.804
Stop twitching, love.

21:56.724 --> 21:58.922
So you d'you reckon this'll be
a regular thing then?

21:58.924 --> 22:00.442
Like fuck. I left for a reason.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.842
Frank's not changed a bit,
he's cleaned me out twice,

22:02.844 --> 22:04.122
had nearly all of my wages.

22:04.124 --> 22:06.402
And Mimi's just trying to stick her
nails right in me.

22:06.404 --> 22:10.362
A simple no was all I wanted.

22:10.364 --> 22:12.482
This is not a good Scout.

22:12.484 --> 22:13.962
Hey, hands off him!

22:13.964 --> 22:15.242
He ruined the camp!

22:15.244 --> 22:17.042
I'm sure you're exaggerating.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.524
Look at him.
Absolutely no respect for the badge.

22:24.564 --> 22:27.522
What? It's only fucking Scouts.
Sit down, have a drink.

22:27.524 --> 22:28.962
What did you say to him?

22:28.964 --> 22:30.002
Nothing.

22:30.004 --> 22:33.482
You! Ruined the camp.

22:33.484 --> 22:34.602
What you having?

22:34.604 --> 22:35.722
Gin and tonic.

22:35.724 --> 22:37.242
Same. Same.

22:37.244 --> 22:38.442
Shut up you!

22:38.444 --> 22:41.402
Not as easy as we thought, eh?
Being a parent.

22:41.404 --> 22:43.402
Not easy having one, either?

22:43.404 --> 22:45.242
You still turned out OK.

22:45.244 --> 22:47.402
Not because of him. Despite.

22:47.404 --> 22:48.882
He has got a job.

22:48.884 --> 22:50.562
So why's he tapping me up?

22:50.564 --> 22:53.202
He needs it more than you.
He's a janny, for God's sake.

22:53.204 --> 22:57.204
You're a big shot architect.

22:58.964 --> 23:01.402
Surveyor's assistant.

23:01.404 --> 23:04.842
I barely scraped my degree, Karen.

23:04.844 --> 23:06.282
I rent.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.802
I shit myself every time a bill
comes through the door

23:08.804 --> 23:12.802
and my daughter dresses like a boy.
But I'm still fucking there.

23:12.804 --> 23:15.122
And I'm doing my best.

23:15.124 --> 23:16.962
Whatever that is.

23:16.964 --> 23:20.402
So is Frank. He didn't have to take
Aiden on. But he did.

23:20.404 --> 23:22.602
When did you see start seeing
a halo round his head?

23:22.604 --> 23:24.402
Still sulking like you
used to an' all?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.682
We know Frank is a selfish bastard.

23:26.684 --> 23:29.282
But I don't think you should let him
get to you.

23:29.284 --> 23:33.284
Look, you are not that kid anymore.
You're a man!

23:34.484 --> 23:35.882
If you fancy me just say so...

23:35.884 --> 23:38.322
Yeah and still a twat,
Phillip Gallagher.

23:38.324 --> 23:40.202
It's a cig machine.

23:40.204 --> 23:42.642
I'm getting off.

23:42.644 --> 23:44.482
Oh, c'mon, mate,
stay for a few more.

23:44.484 --> 23:46.482
Yeah, pool tournament
starts in an hour.

23:46.484 --> 23:50.282
No, I've got to get back home.
I mean to Dad's.

23:50.284 --> 23:53.322
It's two steps away
from paint stripper but,

23:53.324 --> 23:57.324
but you know what they say -
beware Greeks baring gifts.

23:57.924 --> 24:00.722
I'm just going to dash next door
and put this away.

24:00.724 --> 24:02.642
You be all right with your grandad?

24:02.644 --> 24:03.682
Watch her!

24:03.684 --> 24:07.684
Why, is she going to explode?

24:16.964 --> 24:18.602
I like your hair.

24:18.604 --> 24:22.604
Really?

24:23.084 --> 24:25.842
What matters is if you like it.

24:25.844 --> 24:28.922
Don't live your life trying
to please others.

24:28.924 --> 24:31.042
You'll only end up messing it up
for yourself.

24:31.044 --> 24:32.922
But won't that upset people?

24:32.924 --> 24:34.442
And?

24:34.444 --> 24:38.444
We're Gallaghers. We do it our way.

24:43.044 --> 24:44.762
I'm glad you killed Bin Laden.

24:44.764 --> 24:46.002
Oh yeah, me too,

24:46.004 --> 24:50.004
he was an awful c...

25:02.764 --> 25:06.764
Y'alright?

25:08.724 --> 25:10.242
Look at her, see.

25:10.244 --> 25:14.244
Four of 'em running around trying to
give her the wedding of her dreams -

25:15.124 --> 25:18.762
dress, car, pink meringues,
you name it.

25:18.764 --> 25:21.442
They're all waiting around like
twats to see if she likes it.

25:21.444 --> 25:22.842
And does she? Does she fuck.

25:22.844 --> 25:25.562
She hates it,
she hates everything about it.

25:25.564 --> 25:27.202
And you know what she does?

25:27.204 --> 25:28.842
She tells them.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.642
And fair play to her.

25:30.644 --> 25:32.762
It's the same with you
and this dress -

25:32.764 --> 25:34.642
it's up to you. You choose.

25:34.644 --> 25:36.082
Hi, Dad.

25:36.084 --> 25:39.642
You OK, sweetheart?

25:39.644 --> 25:42.162
Oh. That for me?

25:42.164 --> 25:44.882
No. It's for me.

25:44.884 --> 25:47.682
If you've got a clean glass
though...

25:47.684 --> 25:49.562
Oh, beware Greeks bearing gifts.

25:49.564 --> 25:53.564
Not you as well.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.282
I was thinking about staying
for the weekend.

25:56.284 --> 26:00.284
Well as long as
you're happy to pay board.

26:00.404 --> 26:03.042
'I have brought shame both on myself
and my office.'

26:03.044 --> 26:04.202
Won't they be missing you

26:04.204 --> 26:06.522
in middle class suburbia?

26:06.524 --> 26:08.922
It's not as glamorous
as you've imagined.

26:08.924 --> 26:12.282
'Lord Melrose, who quit his position
on Monday, when it was revealed

26:12.284 --> 26:14.282
'he had used rent boys...'

26:14.284 --> 26:18.042
It's a fucking joke!

26:18.044 --> 26:19.482
Skeletons in the closet.

26:19.484 --> 26:21.402
At least he's out the closet.

26:21.404 --> 26:25.404
Well, well and fucking truly now,
never going to go back in again.

26:25.724 --> 26:27.609
Think he put it on the expenses?

26:36.815 --> 26:38.933
You moved!

26:38.935 --> 26:42.935
Let's have a look.
Hope you made me look handsome.

26:43.335 --> 26:47.335
Yeah. It's really good.

26:49.175 --> 26:53.175
That's my family box.

26:57.335 --> 26:59.813
You look different now.

26:59.815 --> 27:03.815
Shut up, Stella!

27:07.975 --> 27:09.293
'Your tits are ready.'

27:09.295 --> 27:11.735
- 'You can pay for a fuck.'
- 'Do it your fucking self!'

27:11.871 --> 27:13.229
'It's not about me.'

27:13.231 --> 27:16.509
'It was me.'

27:16.511 --> 27:19.631
Stella! Coat on - Stella.

27:19.716 --> 27:21.616
Come here while I get this slide in
your hair.

27:21.698 --> 27:23.092
You look like no-one owns you.

27:24.177 --> 27:26.057
We thought we'd take
the kids to the park.

27:26.258 --> 27:27.416
Give you a break.

27:27.418 --> 27:31.418
At least let me do breakfast.
I'm quite domesticated these days.

27:35.418 --> 27:36.416
Frank up yet?

27:36.418 --> 27:38.896
He goes next door for breakfast.

27:38.898 --> 27:41.176
He said he didn't
want to come with us.

27:41.178 --> 27:42.936
Don't worry. We'll feed them.

27:42.938 --> 27:45.878
Well, I'll stock up whilst you're
out. What's your favourite food?

27:45.911 --> 27:46.869
Chocolate milk.

27:46.871 --> 27:48.189
Yay! Chocolate milk!

27:48.191 --> 27:51.029
Come on, kids!
Last one to the swings.

27:51.031 --> 27:55.031
Don't you be sitting around here all
day, worrying, neither.

28:07.951 --> 28:09.429
Do you think it's weird?

28:09.431 --> 28:10.429
What?

28:10.431 --> 28:12.149
Boy George over there.

28:12.151 --> 28:14.709
Well, no other fucker seems to want
to face up to it.

28:14.711 --> 28:16.309
Probably just a phase.

28:16.311 --> 28:19.949
I work with kids.
I know what I'm talking about.

28:19.951 --> 28:23.951
Just her and him the whole time,
there's no mother figure.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.911
She's unbalanced. If we keep it nice
with Lip and Frank,

28:29.511 --> 28:33.511
I could get more time with her,
be that maternal influence.

28:34.191 --> 28:36.429
Maybe she's just different.

28:36.431 --> 28:37.629
A rug muncher?

28:37.631 --> 28:40.629
Do you mean do I think she's
a lesbian? I don't know.

28:40.631 --> 28:41.869
I couldn't care less

28:41.871 --> 28:45.871
if she grows up to be an Olympic
class muff-diver... just so long

28:46.231 --> 28:50.231
as she isn't doing the full k.d.
lang thing at her first holy
communion.

28:50.831 --> 28:54.831
I think he's struggling.

28:58.391 --> 29:01.469
You always manage to get your feet
under the table somewhere.

29:01.471 --> 29:05.109
And I don't have to dress up,
either. Any idea what you look like?

29:05.111 --> 29:07.469
Yeah. An adult.

29:07.471 --> 29:09.389
Oh, he fills his daughter's
head with lies

29:09.391 --> 29:12.949
but the twat's wearing a tie,
so he's a fucking adult now.

29:12.951 --> 29:16.429
What's Stella's favourite food,
Frank?

29:16.431 --> 29:20.431
Chocolate milk. So you know.

29:20.871 --> 29:24.871
Just trying to help you.

29:28.311 --> 29:32.311
Like I was on my period out me arse,
the blood was gushing...

29:32.871 --> 29:35.229
Oh, here he is.
Got your Chatsworth on.

29:35.231 --> 29:39.109
Yaaaaaay!

29:39.111 --> 29:42.629
I wasn't going to say anything
before but you did look like a right
twat in that suit.

29:42.631 --> 29:43.869
Don't hold back.

29:43.871 --> 29:47.871
I wasn't! Let's go fuck shit up!

29:49.671 --> 29:51.989
Ugh, man!

29:51.991 --> 29:54.629
He's in! Go on, son!

29:54.631 --> 29:56.389
Is it not like this round your way,
then?

29:56.391 --> 29:57.229
How d'you mean?

29:57.231 --> 29:59.349
Like it's posh, innit?
Big swanky apartments.

29:59.351 --> 30:02.389
Nah. It's not that swanky
an apartment.

30:02.391 --> 30:05.029
Come to check out my arse, paedo?

30:05.031 --> 30:07.629
Fuck off. Who'd paedo you?

30:07.631 --> 30:10.709
Give us that. Come on.
He's definitely got something.

30:10.711 --> 30:13.869
Specialised market for goggle eyes
and acne.

30:13.871 --> 30:16.469
Come on, darling,
make love to the camera.

30:16.471 --> 30:19.069
That's it, work it, baby!

30:19.071 --> 30:19.949
Hoi!

30:19.951 --> 30:22.429
Hey, Dad, come check out these
paedos!

30:22.431 --> 30:23.549
Fucking perverts!

30:23.551 --> 30:26.229
Even if I was a
pervert I wouldn't touch him!

30:26.231 --> 30:30.231
That's fucking it!

30:52.871 --> 30:56.871
Having expended all his energy
swimming upstream for no

30:57.311 --> 31:01.311
reason at all, the Chatsworth male
eventually stops fighting it

31:01.911 --> 31:04.069
and goes with the flow,

31:04.071 --> 31:08.071
back to the spawning ground to
occupy his correct place in society.

31:10.711 --> 31:11.829
Order is restored.

31:11.831 --> 31:12.869
..drink.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.989
I need the toilet.

31:13.991 --> 31:17.991
Go on, then,
upstairs to the toilet. Nice look.

31:18.391 --> 31:21.749
Temporary. How was that then,
sweetheart?

31:21.751 --> 31:23.109
Great.

31:23.111 --> 31:27.111
We were thinking, it might be nice
to spend a bit of time together as a
family.

31:27.511 --> 31:29.509
Jockey later?

31:29.511 --> 31:31.069
Yeah, OK.

31:31.071 --> 31:33.389
Granddad, will you come with us?

31:33.391 --> 31:37.069
Well... I'm not feeling too good.

31:37.071 --> 31:41.029
Might have to take a rain check.
Old war wounds.

31:41.031 --> 31:44.389
- Better give your granddad
some peace and quiet.
- Yeah, let's get a cup of tea.

31:44.391 --> 31:47.709
He's all talked out.

31:47.711 --> 31:51.711
Ground control to Major Tom.
We have lift off.

31:54.031 --> 31:55.589
Ah, you!

31:55.591 --> 31:58.229
Listen, mate.
I'm sorry about earlier.

31:58.231 --> 31:59.509
We were just having a laugh.

31:59.511 --> 32:03.511
I was being a dick.
Please accept my apology.

32:05.231 --> 32:07.029
Yeah, sure.

32:07.031 --> 32:09.069
Oh!

32:09.071 --> 32:12.589
Oh! Oh!

32:12.591 --> 32:15.149
Go round picking up fucking kiddies,
do you?

32:15.151 --> 32:16.029
Oh!

32:16.031 --> 32:17.709
Katie! Run now!

32:17.711 --> 32:19.429
Oh!

32:19.431 --> 32:23.431
Oh! Oh! Oh!

32:39.871 --> 32:42.471
Take cover!

32:43.911 --> 32:47.431
Bandits at six o'clock!

32:53.031 --> 32:56.829
Ow, ow!

32:56.831 --> 33:00.589
Fuck's sake. Hold on.

33:00.591 --> 33:01.589
What?

33:01.591 --> 33:05.591
Owww! I think I've got a splinter.

33:07.231 --> 33:11.231
She was terrified. I should never
have brought her here.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.149
Are we really that bad?

33:13.151 --> 33:14.309
I'm messing up.

33:14.311 --> 33:16.589
You're not. She's a great kid.

33:16.591 --> 33:18.749
She came here, met our lot.
And coped.

33:18.751 --> 33:19.509
Like you did.

33:19.511 --> 33:22.869
This is coping?
What if I'm getting it all wrong?

33:22.871 --> 33:26.871
What about the way she dresses?
Is she happy?

33:27.711 --> 33:29.229
How do I know if she's happy?

33:29.231 --> 33:33.231
Are you happy?

33:37.751 --> 33:41.029
Oh, Lip.

33:41.031 --> 33:45.031
Sorry.

33:47.311 --> 33:51.311
Sorry, Frank.
Can't seem to stop crying.

33:51.431 --> 33:54.349
It's Biddy, won't come near me.

33:54.351 --> 33:56.829
Hasn't humped me
or thumped me for days.

33:56.831 --> 33:58.909
Oww!

33:58.911 --> 34:00.389
Got it!

34:00.391 --> 34:02.349
Big bastard that.

34:02.351 --> 34:03.869
Have I lost it, Frank?

34:03.871 --> 34:07.871
Never, my little bandit.

34:08.231 --> 34:10.829
What's the matter with you now?

34:10.831 --> 34:14.831
Sympathy pains.

34:17.591 --> 34:19.668
Katie's fine.

34:19.670 --> 34:23.670
Mam and Shane are regaling her with
stories of... something funny.

34:25.471 --> 34:28.389
Thanks.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.989
Right, better be getting
Katie back home.

34:31.991 --> 34:35.349
Lip. She's got a family here.
You both have.

34:35.351 --> 34:37.389
You are putting all this
pressure on yourself.

34:37.391 --> 34:40.668
This daft lie with Frank.
He's a shit, so what?

34:40.670 --> 34:44.670
You do not let him
cost you all of us.

34:45.591 --> 34:49.591
Thanks.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.389
Coggsy!

34:58.391 --> 35:00.509
He won't come back, will he?

35:00.511 --> 35:04.511
No, sweetheart.
Uncle Jamie chased him away.

35:05.071 --> 35:09.071
I like Jamie. And Karen and Billy.

35:09.271 --> 35:12.509
I like them all.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.469
They like you, too.

35:15.471 --> 35:18.949
Your orders -
if you choose to accept...

35:18.951 --> 35:19.789
Frank!

35:19.791 --> 35:21.709
No talking in line, soldier.

35:21.711 --> 35:23.749
Frank!

35:23.751 --> 35:27.751
What the fuck's going on?

35:28.711 --> 35:29.549
Oh, come on!

35:29.551 --> 35:32.029
No, Frank! No - we've got morals!

35:32.031 --> 35:36.031
He doesn't even live here.

35:38.191 --> 35:39.829
Thank you very fucking much.

35:39.831 --> 35:41.509
Oh, you're angry at us?

35:41.511 --> 35:42.589
A working man

35:42.591 --> 35:46.229
gets one day a week to spend
his hard-earned money as he sees fit

35:46.231 --> 35:50.231
and the disappointing fruit of his
loins comes along and fucks it up.

35:50.271 --> 35:52.509
I need to speak to Katie. Alone.

35:52.511 --> 35:55.909
Well, I'm out of pocket now, so bung
us a tenner, I'll be out your hair.

35:55.911 --> 35:58.029
I haven't got any.
You've had the last of my wages.

35:58.031 --> 36:01.829
Granddad,
why have you got your uniform on?

36:01.831 --> 36:03.309
Do you have to go back?

36:03.311 --> 36:07.311
No, love.
And let's get one thing straight.

36:07.871 --> 36:11.871
I am not, and have never been
part of Her Majesty's armed forces.

36:12.831 --> 36:15.269
Your dad lied to you.

36:15.271 --> 36:17.589
Every night you were praying,
hoping I'd come back?

36:17.591 --> 36:21.349
I was always here.
Only one bus ride away.

36:21.351 --> 36:25.229
Take my advice - don't believe a
word he tells you ever again.

36:25.231 --> 36:28.949
He's full of it.

36:28.951 --> 36:31.069
Is that it, then?
You just drop a bomb and walk off?

36:31.071 --> 36:32.989
Combat references. How appropriate.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.109
You're a cunt.

36:34.111 --> 36:35.869
Hey - you're all still alive.

36:35.871 --> 36:38.909
Her up the road's got three dead.
Go and call her a cunt.

36:38.911 --> 36:41.469
Thought the job was over once you'd
pulled your dick out?

36:41.471 --> 36:44.829
You're repulsive.
You're fucking disgusting.

36:44.831 --> 36:47.069
You gave me nothing.

36:47.071 --> 36:50.149
What the fuck do you want?

36:50.151 --> 36:53.949
Ever since you arrived you've been
sorry for yourself, desperation

36:53.951 --> 36:57.951
oozing out of every insignificant,
under-achieving little pore.

37:02.671 --> 37:04.749
I did give you something.

37:04.751 --> 37:07.869
I gave you fucking freedom
and you can't even use it

37:07.871 --> 37:09.149
because every thing you do,

37:09.151 --> 37:11.789
every decision you make is about me,
isn't it?

37:11.791 --> 37:13.349
You carry me up here.

37:13.351 --> 37:17.381
Yeah, keep fucking walking.
I'm with you every single step.

37:27.854 --> 37:29.254
Oi, Zippy and Bungle.

37:29.284 --> 37:30.962
Nearly did meself an injury there.

37:30.964 --> 37:32.104
Where's your Dad?

37:32.115 --> 37:33.433
Dunno, not here.

37:33.435 --> 37:37.435
Lucky bastard.
I'm off to have me breakfast.

37:44.435 --> 37:47.353
Oh, there you are.

37:47.355 --> 37:51.355
Your breakfast's ready.

37:54.555 --> 37:58.555
All right! Fucking coming!

37:59.835 --> 38:01.153
Can I help you, sir?

38:01.155 --> 38:02.593
You not got a home to go to?

38:02.595 --> 38:06.595
Ha-ha, very funny.

38:06.835 --> 38:08.353
Do us a pint.

38:08.355 --> 38:09.673
Trying it out for size?

38:09.675 --> 38:11.833
I could do without
a lesson in morals from you.

38:11.835 --> 38:13.033
It's been a hard night, OK?

38:13.035 --> 38:16.033
- If it looks like a tramp
and smells like a tramp...
- I don't want to talk about it.

38:16.035 --> 38:18.233
Then why hammer my door down
at the crack of the arse?

38:18.235 --> 38:20.193
You might not talk
but you'll fucking listen.

38:20.195 --> 38:23.113
- Graduate of Mimi Maguire's
School Of Counselling...
- Look at the state of you, Lip!

38:23.115 --> 38:25.393
You've been back 48 hours
and you're a fucking mess!

38:25.395 --> 38:28.193
I am embracing my fine heritage.

38:28.195 --> 38:30.713
You was the one who told me
to go out and have a bit of fun.

38:30.715 --> 38:33.073
Looks like you're laughing it
right up.

38:33.075 --> 38:36.433
Oh, and while you were out last
night embracing your fine heritage,

38:36.435 --> 38:40.435
have you any idea
where your daughter is?

38:44.195 --> 38:45.873
Where's your dad?

38:45.875 --> 38:47.753
Not here. Lucky bastard.

38:47.755 --> 38:49.753
He didn't come home.

38:49.755 --> 38:52.353
OK, sweetheart,
you're coming back with me.

38:52.355 --> 38:55.993
- Shouldn't I wait here with her?
- Come on!

38:55.995 --> 38:58.913
Orphan Annie there ain't my problem.

38:58.915 --> 39:00.553
No granddaughter of mine

39:00.555 --> 39:03.593
is living in this shit tip
like this any longer.

39:03.595 --> 39:07.595
See ya!

39:11.035 --> 39:15.035
If there's a lesson I can give you,
it's that men are thick as fuck.

39:15.595 --> 39:19.595
That's how I know it must be hard,
only having your dad to talk to.

39:21.715 --> 39:25.715
I can see why you've made
the choices you've made.

39:26.155 --> 39:29.753
It's just that carrying on like this
isn't helping anyone.

39:29.755 --> 39:33.755
It's not your fault, love,
having the dad you've got.

39:37.075 --> 39:41.075
I picked this up for you.

39:43.155 --> 39:44.673
Pretty, isn't it.

39:44.675 --> 39:47.233
None of us wants to be a boy.

39:47.235 --> 39:51.153
Imagine going through life being
one of those lanky streaks of piss.

39:51.155 --> 39:53.433
Why don't we try it, eh?

39:53.435 --> 39:57.435
See how it feels?

40:05.395 --> 40:07.633
Do you want something?

40:07.635 --> 40:10.713
Or is acting creepy as fuck
another one of your quirks?

40:10.715 --> 40:13.153
Just watching a leader at work.

40:13.155 --> 40:15.673
More afternoon drinking
with Frank, is it?

40:15.675 --> 40:18.153
You need to deal
with this Scouts business.

40:18.155 --> 40:21.673
I'll talk to Remona,
offer to pay for any cow damage.

40:21.675 --> 40:22.833
I meant with Saul!

40:22.835 --> 40:24.473
He'll get over it, kids do.

40:24.475 --> 40:26.353
He shouldn't have to get over it.

40:26.355 --> 40:28.553
Scouts is something he wanted to do.

40:28.555 --> 40:32.033
Before Uncle Big Balls came along
and wasted it for him.

40:32.035 --> 40:33.553
That wasn't my intention.

40:33.555 --> 40:36.313
You made him feel like a twat
so he acted like one.

40:36.315 --> 40:40.315
So now you and your big swinging
ball sack need to sort it.

40:43.235 --> 40:47.235
Oh, you look gorgeous!

40:51.715 --> 40:53.553
Me and Katie have been having
a great time.

40:53.555 --> 40:55.273
Take it off, love. We're going home.

40:55.275 --> 40:56.393
Stay as you are.

40:56.395 --> 40:58.993
I think your dad here's
a little bit confused.

40:58.995 --> 41:01.393
You can't just
stick her in a dress, Mimi.

41:01.395 --> 41:03.113
She's not bloody Barbie!

41:03.115 --> 41:04.793
No, she thinks she's fucking Ken.

41:04.795 --> 41:08.795
Take... the dress... off!

41:16.315 --> 41:19.313
The prodigal son trick
is to go back the once.

41:19.315 --> 41:21.433
Law of diminishing returns with you.

41:21.435 --> 41:22.953
We're leaving.

41:22.955 --> 41:26.955
Oh, he's come back to tell us
he's going away.

41:27.275 --> 41:30.633
I'm sorry. Again.

41:30.635 --> 41:32.073
It's OK.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.593
Don't worry. He'll be back when the

41:34.595 --> 41:37.113
next existential crisis hits him.
Another failure to hang

41:37.115 --> 41:38.473
on his poor old dad.

41:38.475 --> 41:42.475
It's Katie's communion next week.
I won't stop you coming.

41:42.875 --> 41:46.875
Bear with me while I deal with the
overwhelming emotion of the moment.

41:51.995 --> 41:55.995
Come on, sweetheart.

42:06.315 --> 42:10.033
Sloppy work, Nazir.
I could blow that one down myself.

42:10.035 --> 42:11.753
Cow!

42:11.755 --> 42:15.755
Now then, boys, look.
This is how it should be done.

42:15.915 --> 42:17.633
Well, Baloo helped me.

42:17.635 --> 42:20.073
Well done, Baloo.

42:20.075 --> 42:24.075
# Well done, Baloo!

42:24.275 --> 42:26.993
# Well done to you!

42:26.995 --> 42:28.913
# Well done, Baloo!

42:28.915 --> 42:32.915
# Well done to you! #

42:51.515 --> 42:53.633
Oh, the camera loves you.

42:53.635 --> 42:57.635
State of them. They're supposed
to be marrying the baby Jesus.

43:00.675 --> 43:04.393
Oh, will you look at that?
She's like an angel.

43:04.395 --> 43:07.153
It's not too late to change
your mind, you know.

43:07.155 --> 43:10.233
It makes Nana happy.

43:10.235 --> 43:13.755
That's no reason to do something
if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

43:16.035 --> 43:18.993
Grandad said we're Gallaghers -
we do it our own way.

43:18.995 --> 43:22.995
Yeah.
That's usually the bloody hard way.

43:23.755 --> 43:26.673
Hiya, gorgeous!

43:26.675 --> 43:30.675
Hiya, sweetheart!

43:31.075 --> 43:34.313
You got off lightly -
she were going to make you wear this!

43:34.315 --> 43:36.513
Love your shoes.

43:36.515 --> 43:40.515
Let's get in, let's do it.

43:42.395 --> 43:43.473
Frank?

43:43.475 --> 43:47.475
He knows it's on.

43:59.395 --> 44:03.395
You may enter the boardroom.

44:04.835 --> 44:06.633
Now in the 17th century,

44:06.635 --> 44:09.833
your parents might have handed
you off to a wet nurse.

44:09.835 --> 44:13.553
That's a woman who breast-feeds you
so your ma doesn't have to.

44:13.555 --> 44:15.593
I mean, that's brilliant!

44:15.595 --> 44:19.113
Spend your early years
sucking on a stranger's tits.

44:19.115 --> 44:21.353
And meanwhile,
Dad just stands there,

44:21.355 --> 44:24.713
the spare prick at the wedding,
so to speak.

44:24.715 --> 44:28.433
Because we never have
that same bond that mothers do.

44:28.435 --> 44:31.833
We never carry
the little ones around inside us.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.713
'The job's more or less finished
after you've pulled your dick out.

44:34.715 --> 44:37.673
'Except it's not.
And that's the big secret, isn't it?

44:37.675 --> 44:39.593
'We're terrified of our kids.

44:39.595 --> 44:43.595
'Little strangers
taking over our lives.

44:44.915 --> 44:47.273
'We don't always fuck up
because we're twats...

44:47.275 --> 44:51.275
'It's because we don't know
what else to do.

44:53.475 --> 44:57.033
'So thank fuck
for the extended family.'

44:57.035 --> 45:00.473
Well, most of 'em anyway.

45:00.475 --> 45:01.913
'You know I need to hear it,'

45:01.915 --> 45:03.433
those three little words.

45:03.435 --> 45:04.633
I'm here to see Remona.

45:04.635 --> 45:05.513
Piss off, Dad.

45:05.515 --> 45:07.593
A little secret between you and her?

45:07.595 --> 45:08.993
For fuck's sake!

45:08.995 --> 45:10.033
I am tired

45:10.035 --> 45:12.913
of seeing her buzzing around you
like a fly on shit.

45:12.915 --> 45:15.313
- What are you doing here?
- He's taken me passport.

45:15.315 --> 45:17.753
If I'm going to get her out of here,
I need you

45:17.755 --> 45:20.713
to get him off our backs
while I do it.

45:20.715 --> 45:22.393
He's not doing it for love, is he?

45:22.395 --> 45:24.353
Come on, you've got
a plane to catch.

45:24.355 --> 45:25.963
You're not going anywhere.

45:26.003 --> 46:06.081

# Kumbaya

46:09.041 --> 46:11.519
# Kumbaya, my Lord

46:11.521 --> 46:13.641
# Kumbaya... #

46:15.875 --> 46:19.875
All right, Baloo?
You're not scared, are you?

46:24.635 --> 46:28.635
Touch me
and I'll cut your hands off.

46:30.275 --> 46:33.001
Sleep tight.
