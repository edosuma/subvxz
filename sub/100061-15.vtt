WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.070
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...

00:06.930 --> 00:09.304
Why would a guy come to a bar and order

00:09.329 --> 00:10.496
a club soda?

00:10.528 --> 00:12.562
- Would you like to sit?
- Yeah.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.322
I don't know, if you're
up for it sometime,

00:16.347 --> 00:17.445
maybe I'd like to
take you out to dinner?

00:17.470 --> 00:18.770
I would like that very much.

00:18.795 --> 00:20.829
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm calling a Lyft.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.098
Think I can give you a ride home.

00:23.046 --> 00:24.957
He sees us, right?

00:24.982 --> 00:26.049
Hold on.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:35.023 --> 00:38.012
- What is this?
- I'm sorry, Steve.

00:38.078 --> 00:39.411
Hey! I'm talking to you.

00:39.479 --> 00:41.213
I've had your back from day one.

00:41.238 --> 00:42.371
You deserve the truth.

00:42.525 --> 00:44.226
I can't give you that.

00:44.251 --> 00:45.317
Mr. Noshimuri.

00:45.342 --> 00:47.477
Kenji is not fit to be oyabun.

00:47.629 --> 00:49.397
You feel you are better suited to lead?

00:49.422 --> 00:50.523
Oyabun

00:50.548 --> 00:53.037
- is my birthright.
- I will allow this.

00:53.062 --> 00:56.438
You'll return to your
task force on Hawaii to be

00:56.463 --> 00:59.343
my eyes and ears inside Five-O.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.006
The question remains...

01:01.031 --> 01:03.594
how badly do you want
to fulfill your destiny?

01:03.773 --> 01:05.441
To whom are you loyal?

01:27.191 --> 01:29.259
- Sure this is safe?
- Endo.

01:30.012 --> 01:31.616
Just get out.

01:42.940 --> 01:45.008
You didn't answer my question.

01:46.087 --> 01:48.389
It's a hell of a lot
safer than the last spot.

01:48.499 --> 01:50.066
All right? HPD is gonna be all over

01:50.091 --> 01:51.558
that location tomorrow morning.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.751
Yeah, interesting how that happened.

01:55.497 --> 01:56.974
Are you suggesting I had something to do

01:56.998 --> 01:59.376
with HPD finding out
about the dump site?

02:00.683 --> 02:02.684
It's a theory.

02:06.798 --> 02:09.274
Well, I suggest you keep
your theories to yourself.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.998
Or I'll be burying four
bodies tonight, not three.

03:22.965 --> 03:26.334
Excuse me. Mrs. LaPietra?

03:28.223 --> 03:30.657
Hi, um, I'm-I'm
Detective Danny Williams.

03:30.682 --> 03:32.526
I asked them to... call me when someone

03:32.551 --> 03:34.652
from Joanna's family got here.

03:36.011 --> 03:37.411
So, you're him.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.624
Joanna, um, texted me from the bar.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.615
I guess you got up to
take a work call. Hmm.

03:46.492 --> 03:50.978
She said she met this
funny, good-looking guy.

03:52.056 --> 03:53.690
Yes, that's me.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.954
- Um, I, uh...
- W... Y-You don't...

04:01.065 --> 04:02.999
have to say anything.

04:03.196 --> 04:05.460
Um, I read the accident report.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.781
No, I know what happened.

04:08.573 --> 04:10.046
How, um...

04:12.022 --> 04:13.690
how she died.

04:16.779 --> 04:18.081
It wasn't your fault.

04:18.497 --> 04:20.765
I know you did everything you could.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.913
It means a lot to me that you're here.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.649
You were the last...

04:33.788 --> 04:36.218
You...

04:36.891 --> 04:38.759
You were with her when she died.

04:39.054 --> 04:40.303
I'm sorry.

04:40.328 --> 04:43.311
I'm so sorry. That's it. I just
want to tell you I'm so sorry.

04:43.460 --> 04:46.202
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

05:11.413 --> 05:13.036
You want to talk about it?

05:13.061 --> 05:15.062
No. What am I gonna say?

05:15.087 --> 05:16.187
Let's go.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.774
Look at you, early to class,

05:27.799 --> 05:29.266
head buried in a book...

05:29.291 --> 05:31.592
Sup, Tani? Wait, are
you teaching this class?

05:31.617 --> 05:33.718
I am indeed. Yeah, but
don't get too excited.

05:33.743 --> 05:36.469
It's a one-off. I'm doing
a favor for Captain Keo.

05:36.857 --> 05:39.117
- What is that look?
- Come on, now.

05:39.142 --> 05:42.223
You just couldn't pass up an opportunity
to check on me for Uncle Lou.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.567
I assume he knows you're here?

05:44.592 --> 05:46.008
Mm-hmm.

05:46.033 --> 05:48.962
- Y'all ain't slick.
- Okay. I mean, he... Fine. He did float

05:48.987 --> 05:50.387
the idea of me reporting back,

05:50.412 --> 05:52.075
but to be honest, I
heard you're killing it.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.211
Captain Keo told me you were
practically acing all your classes.

05:54.235 --> 05:57.270
I believe he used the term "prodigy,"

05:57.295 --> 05:59.363
- but don't quote me on that.
- He said that?

05:59.403 --> 06:01.172
His exact words. I kid you not.

06:01.197 --> 06:02.920
So, obviously, I had
to come see for myself.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.179
- Thanks. No pressure.
- Oh, girl, you got this.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.627
Um, okay, I should probably
get this class started.

06:09.651 --> 06:12.519
But, uh, if you're free
later, let's have lunch.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.846
I promise to ask lots of deeply probing,
uncomfortable questions.

06:15.871 --> 06:17.204
- I'd like that.
- Okay, good.

06:19.196 --> 06:22.187
All right. Good morning, recruits.

06:22.212 --> 06:23.946
I'm Officer Tani Rey.

06:23.971 --> 06:26.745
I'm with the Five-O Task Force,
and I'll be your guest instructor

06:26.770 --> 06:30.196
- for today's weapons training.
- Five-O in the building!

06:38.261 --> 06:40.672
Thanks for saving me a seat, babe.

06:41.203 --> 06:43.204
Of course, Endo.

06:47.937 --> 06:51.225
Okay, let's start with some
simple door work.

06:51.751 --> 06:54.217
If your door opens inward...

07:04.141 --> 07:06.580
2.06 seconds.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.547
Nice grouping.

07:09.109 --> 07:11.518
Not bad, Recruit Tanaka.

07:13.146 --> 07:16.468
But on the street, "not bad"

07:16.493 --> 07:18.161
could see you end up in the morgue.

07:18.562 --> 07:21.231
The Failure to Stop drill is designed

07:21.256 --> 07:24.187
to prevent loss of life...
Specifically, your own.

07:25.039 --> 07:27.648
Movies and television have
conditioned us to believe

07:27.673 --> 07:30.039
that shooting someone stops
them dead in their tracks.

07:30.064 --> 07:31.965
It doesn't.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.125
You could miss vital organs,

07:34.150 --> 07:36.585
your perp could be wearing body armor,

07:36.957 --> 07:40.295
or worse, he could be
so strung out on PCP,

07:40.320 --> 07:42.866
he doesn't even realize
that he's been shot.

07:42.891 --> 07:46.547
And every step towards
you narrows the gap,

07:47.047 --> 07:50.258
along with your chances of
putting your suspect down.

07:50.289 --> 07:52.305
You want to go home alive?

07:52.780 --> 07:54.247
You want to go home alive?

07:54.705 --> 07:56.969
Get faster.

07:57.405 --> 08:00.805
All right. Recruit Dayton,
you're up. Let's go.

08:22.810 --> 08:25.312
1.02 seconds.

08:28.016 --> 08:29.853
Just so everyone knows...

08:31.239 --> 08:33.905
"get faster" means this.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.966
Tight center mass grouping.

08:35.991 --> 08:39.773
Headshot directly below the
chin, severing the perp's spine.

08:40.359 --> 08:43.773
That means good guy goes home,
bad guy goes to the morgue.

08:44.519 --> 08:47.221
All this, and more
than one second faster

08:47.246 --> 08:49.114
than the fastest time today.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.967
On the street,

08:50.992 --> 08:52.860
one second could be the difference

08:52.885 --> 08:55.007
between ending up dead or alive.

08:55.231 --> 08:56.656
Well done, recruit.

09:01.136 --> 09:02.986
Teacher's pet.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.407
Recruit Kaholo, you're up.

09:07.422 --> 09:08.689
Let's go!

09:18.722 --> 09:20.123
Hey.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.999
- Morning, Lou.
- Adam.

09:23.024 --> 09:24.591
What do you say, buddy?

09:24.659 --> 09:26.260
- Oh, you know.
- Come on, now.

09:26.285 --> 09:27.686
- Hey.
- My man.

09:28.930 --> 09:30.875
Thanks for the coffee date.
I appreciate it, buddy.

09:30.899 --> 09:31.999
Of course.

09:32.024 --> 09:33.478
Of course.

09:33.884 --> 09:36.790
I'm just... checking in
with you, is all.

09:38.374 --> 09:40.720
I got to be honest, though. Um...

09:40.962 --> 09:42.897
We're all a little worried about you.

09:42.922 --> 09:44.723
Seem to have a lot going on these days.

09:44.748 --> 09:49.859
Yeah. Yeah. You know,
look, I could've been,

09:49.884 --> 09:51.919
uh, a lot better about
keeping you all in the loop.

09:51.944 --> 09:53.463
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, no.

09:53.488 --> 09:55.181
Come on, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

09:55.206 --> 09:57.941
I just want you to know that, uh...

09:58.369 --> 10:00.431
well, if you really do need
help, we're here for you.

10:00.456 --> 10:02.824
You know that. We got you, man.

10:03.215 --> 10:04.548
Thanks, Lou.

10:09.204 --> 10:12.115
You know, I didn't
expect Masuda's death

10:12.140 --> 10:14.704
- to hit me like it did.
- Mm.

10:14.946 --> 10:18.521
It brought back a lot
of... painful memories

10:18.546 --> 10:21.907
- about the way my father died.
- Yeah.

10:21.932 --> 10:23.470
I just needed some time away, you know?

10:23.495 --> 10:25.829
That's why I went to
Tokyo, to clear my head,

10:26.540 --> 10:29.649
- to reconnect with family.
- Yeah, I can see that.

10:31.209 --> 10:34.876
But I mean, if it's
family you're looking for,

10:34.901 --> 10:37.470
you don't have to go
all the way to Japan.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.071
You got that right here on the rock.

10:41.434 --> 10:43.201
I do.

10:43.532 --> 10:44.671
And I really appreciate

10:44.731 --> 10:47.721
- the support, buddy.
- Of course. Anytime.

10:48.970 --> 10:50.493
So, should we get that
coffee now or what?

10:50.518 --> 10:51.678
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

10:51.703 --> 10:54.915
- Well, next time, it's on me.
- Oh, you damn right it's on you.

10:54.940 --> 10:57.501
- Yeah, I know you'll hold me to it.
- You got that right.

11:03.137 --> 11:05.524
Yeah, I'm still here
with Adam, but, um...

11:05.985 --> 11:10.497
- you better start wrapping things up.
- Copy that, thanks.

11:10.522 --> 11:13.324
Well, you heard the man...
It's time to wrap it up.

11:13.349 --> 11:15.127
Not that I wanted to be
here in the first place.

11:15.152 --> 11:18.524
Oh, good... we're gonna to have
that conversation again, huh?

11:18.549 --> 11:20.187
Do you not find it a little bit crazy

11:20.212 --> 11:21.589
that we're doing all
this just because you had

11:21.614 --> 11:23.281
a feeling about Adam?

11:23.554 --> 11:24.487
A feeling?

11:24.512 --> 11:27.555
Okay, you're not
in any way interested in the fact

11:27.743 --> 11:30.184
that Adam resigned from
Five-O, then disappeared,

11:30.209 --> 11:31.962
and now, he just
rejoined the Task Force.

11:31.987 --> 11:34.329
You don't find that sequence
of events suspicious at all?

11:34.354 --> 11:36.622
Maybe I find it a
little suspicious, okay?

11:36.647 --> 11:39.569
Maybe, but the point is
that if I was a human being,

11:39.594 --> 11:41.032
I would sit down, I
would talk to the guy.

11:41.057 --> 11:42.407
I would say, "Hey,
what's going on?" instead

11:42.432 --> 11:43.649
of snooping around in
his underwear drawer,

11:43.674 --> 11:45.175
breaking into his house, you know?

11:49.962 --> 11:51.582
What do you want to do, now, Steve?

11:51.606 --> 11:53.266
Rip up the walls? There's nothing here.

11:53.291 --> 11:56.777
Look, he never explained what his watch
was doing at that crime scene.

11:56.802 --> 11:59.212
I'm telling you there's
something we're not seeing.

11:59.237 --> 12:01.454
Okay, all right, well, I got a question.

12:01.479 --> 12:03.618
Um, if you're so suspicious of the guy,

12:03.643 --> 12:06.111
why'd you welcome him
back to the team so easily?

12:06.276 --> 12:08.611
I want him where I
can keep an eye on him.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.267
Oh, that makes sense.

12:11.805 --> 12:14.165
That was, uh, quite the
show you put on back there.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.224
Really?

12:15.644 --> 12:18.376
Okay, yeah, it kind of was.

12:18.417 --> 12:21.044
- Thank you.
- For?

12:21.069 --> 12:22.436
For checking on me.

12:22.461 --> 12:24.446
I'm starting to really get
what that word 'ohana means.

12:24.471 --> 12:27.340
Between Uncle Lou,
all you guys at Five-O,

12:27.380 --> 12:30.298
I just really feel like...
feel like you guys really got me.

12:30.323 --> 12:31.961
I just want you to know I appreciate it.

12:32.407 --> 12:34.314
Yeah, always.

12:34.876 --> 12:36.492
So...

12:36.774 --> 12:39.553
I kind of need some advice.

12:40.399 --> 12:42.823
Ooh... boys?

12:42.848 --> 12:44.048
Okay.

12:44.201 --> 12:47.240
- What's the tea?
- I'm...

12:47.870 --> 12:50.610
kind of feeling one of the
other students in my class.

12:50.635 --> 12:53.267
Uh-huh. You mean Recruit Tanaka?

12:53.292 --> 12:55.802
Damn! Is it that obvious?

12:55.827 --> 12:57.127
Siobhan.

12:57.281 --> 13:01.180
- Okay, fine. I'll stop fronting.
- Thank you.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.954
Everything's been really cool.

13:03.979 --> 13:05.989
He's... super sweet.

13:06.374 --> 13:09.468
And... I really love
spending time with him.

13:09.493 --> 13:13.777
But... I don't know. I'm worried
he might be seeing someone else.

13:13.802 --> 13:15.851
Like, on the side.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.535
Have you had "the talk" yet?

13:19.567 --> 13:21.468
The boyfriend/girlfriend talk? No.

13:21.785 --> 13:23.572
Not yet, I just...

13:23.597 --> 13:26.335
- I don't know what I should do.
- Well...

13:26.360 --> 13:27.999
it's normal to feel
insecure when you're first

13:28.024 --> 13:31.382
starting to fall for someone.
That's just part of the deal.

13:32.594 --> 13:35.329
You know, it makes you
feel vulnerable and crazy.

13:35.929 --> 13:38.187
And then, sometimes...

13:39.087 --> 13:41.046
sometimes it's the best
feeling in the world.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.267
What?

13:47.798 --> 13:49.933
A few nights ago, I was at his spot,

13:49.958 --> 13:50.958
and...

13:51.509 --> 13:53.603
I noticed he had two cell phones.

13:54.548 --> 13:57.525
Okay, hmm. Bat phone.

13:57.949 --> 13:59.916
All right, this one's easy.

14:00.368 --> 14:02.134
- Run.
- I know, but...

14:02.159 --> 14:03.527
Bat phone.

14:07.300 --> 14:08.728
All right, let... okay.

14:08.786 --> 14:10.754
Let's say that he's
on the up-and-up.

14:11.388 --> 14:12.755
Here's one thing I know for sure...

14:12.780 --> 14:14.478
You have to have a
conversation with him.

14:14.658 --> 14:16.559
Just tell him how you feel.

14:16.584 --> 14:19.275
Tell him that you'd rather
you two not see other people.

14:20.922 --> 14:22.392
Or just ask him about the phone.

14:22.417 --> 14:24.751
'Cause maybe there's some
innocent reason he has it.

14:25.939 --> 14:27.494
The bottom line is...

14:27.519 --> 14:29.086
if you're not on the same page

14:29.267 --> 14:31.702
or he's not giving you the
answer that you're looking for,

14:31.788 --> 14:34.017
then it's early enough
that you can cut bait.

14:35.148 --> 14:37.158
It's better now than a year from now.

14:41.342 --> 14:44.455
One more, guys!
Hurry up, let's go, let's go!

14:52.629 --> 14:56.056
- Hey.
- What's up, quick draw?

14:57.431 --> 15:00.431
Listen... there's kind of something
I need to talk to you about.

15:00.456 --> 15:02.744
Hey, uh, babe, can we
talk about this later?

15:02.769 --> 15:04.680
There's something I need
to take care of right now.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.106
So, we're not gonna study together?

15:06.269 --> 15:09.905
Uh, you sure that was today?

15:09.930 --> 15:12.017
Pretty sure.

15:14.517 --> 15:16.252
Babe, I'm really sorry.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.044
I-I don't know how I
got mixed up about it.

15:18.069 --> 15:20.070
I promise I'll make it up to you, okay?

15:28.897 --> 15:30.131
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:30.156 --> 15:31.569
So, I spoke with Duke.

15:31.594 --> 15:33.866
HPD went out to investigate
that alleged Yakuza

15:33.891 --> 15:35.366
burial site this morning.

15:35.391 --> 15:38.327
They found three freshly
excavated pits, but no bodies.

15:38.352 --> 15:39.886
They moved the bodies overnight?

15:39.911 --> 15:41.345
Intel was accurate.

15:41.385 --> 15:43.557
Right, but clearly somebody
tipped off the Yakuza

15:43.582 --> 15:45.750
that HPD would be digging
up that site this morning.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.461
All right, good work, Quinn.

15:47.486 --> 15:49.253
Stay close to HPD, keep us posted.

15:49.321 --> 15:50.756
Got it.

15:54.748 --> 15:56.203
Say it, what?

15:56.228 --> 15:58.262
Who do we know who had
access to that information,

15:58.287 --> 16:00.888
and who would've known
about an HPD raid in advance?

16:13.292 --> 16:16.256
_

16:20.592 --> 16:22.192
Hey, babe, what's up?

16:22.217 --> 16:24.952
Hey, I'm actually not far from you now.

16:25.177 --> 16:26.491
If you're home, I could swing by.

16:26.516 --> 16:29.092
Aw, man, I'm actually out
with a friend right now.

16:29.117 --> 16:30.692
But, uh, let me hit
you up when I'm back.

16:30.716 --> 16:32.417
Maybe you could come over then?

16:32.442 --> 16:34.389
- Sure.
- Can't wait.

17:03.624 --> 17:05.692
There's been talk of HPD shifting more

17:05.717 --> 17:07.067
resources to the Wahele district.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.388
You may want to let your dealers know.

17:08.414 --> 17:09.796
Understand.

17:11.970 --> 17:13.256
Move!

17:14.236 --> 17:16.237
Siobhan, come back here!

17:26.277 --> 17:28.211
You really shouldn't have done that.

17:35.063 --> 17:36.941
Leave a message, I'll call you back

17:36.966 --> 17:39.211
- Again, straight to voice mail.
- Don't assume the worst, Lou.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.802
She's gonna turn up, you'll see.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.929
Hey, yo, what's going on?

17:42.954 --> 17:44.788
Bonnie didn't come home last night.

17:44.983 --> 17:47.618
And before anybody
says I'm overreacting,

17:47.643 --> 17:49.254
and I need to get my
old ass with the times,

17:49.278 --> 17:52.064
she also didn't show up
at the academy this morning.

17:52.089 --> 17:54.649
Okay, and no-no word from her, nothing?

17:54.674 --> 17:58.142
No phone call, no text, nothing.

17:58.361 --> 18:00.743
Okay? And apparently,

18:00.768 --> 18:03.579
her phone is switched off,
because every time I call that,

18:03.604 --> 18:05.738
it goes right to voice mail.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.545
This ain't like her, man.

18:07.570 --> 18:09.150
Well, have you tried her friends?

18:09.175 --> 18:11.931
Yeah. Again, nothing!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.704
I even got a little crazy this morning,

18:14.729 --> 18:16.563
started calling around
the local hospitals,

18:16.588 --> 18:18.356
which has done nothing for me, except

18:18.381 --> 18:21.993
grow this increasingly large
pit of anxiety in my stomach.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.786
Lou, maybe she just spent
the night with her boyfriend.

18:26.176 --> 18:27.603
"Boyfriend"?

18:29.275 --> 18:32.134
I'm sorry, I didn't... I
just assumed that you knew.

18:32.159 --> 18:33.392
Girl, look at my face!

18:33.417 --> 18:35.685
- Ooh.
- Lou, I just found out yesterday.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.275
Apparently, it's a new thing.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.157
Meaning she hardly knows the guy?!

18:39.182 --> 18:41.501
Who, well, who in the hell is this?!

18:42.025 --> 18:44.431
He's a recruit at the academy.

18:46.217 --> 18:48.085
Endo Tanaka.

18:48.110 --> 18:50.275
Let's run a trace on Siobhan's cell.

18:50.300 --> 18:52.635
See if we can get a GPS location.

18:55.353 --> 18:57.032
All right, looks like
it was powered down

18:57.057 --> 18:59.225
at 8:07 p.m. last night.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.565
Shortly before that,

19:01.590 --> 19:03.392
it pinged at a tower
in the Manoa district.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.919
Wait a minute, pull
that kid's ID back up.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.513
117 Kalawao Avenue... That's in Manoa.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.017
Yeah, that's right where
Siobhan's phone records

19:10.042 --> 19:11.220
place her last night.

19:11.267 --> 19:13.266
Okay, so maybe she visits the boyfriend.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.259
Decides to spend the
night, and, meanwhile,

19:15.284 --> 19:16.951
her-her cell phone runs out of battery.

19:16.976 --> 19:19.244
Yeah, or it was switched off.

19:19.269 --> 19:20.869
Siobhan recently discovered

19:20.894 --> 19:23.062
that Endo had a second cell phone.

19:23.087 --> 19:24.254
A secret one.

19:24.536 --> 19:26.070
She thought he might be cheating.

19:26.138 --> 19:28.249
I suggested she go over there
and talk to him about it.

19:28.273 --> 19:29.704
And you didn't think to tell me

19:29.729 --> 19:31.218
any of this stuff yesterday, Tani?

19:31.243 --> 19:33.577
You know what, fine, fine.

19:33.602 --> 19:35.603
Now this chump can talk to me.

19:36.025 --> 19:37.415
Let's make it happen.

19:40.089 --> 19:42.090
Damn it, Bonnie.

19:52.574 --> 19:54.975
Didn't expect to hear from
you so soon, Noshimuri.

19:55.681 --> 19:57.835
Do you have more information for me?

19:58.501 --> 20:00.404
That kid I was with a
couple of nights ago, Endo,

20:00.429 --> 20:02.163
said he was your godson... Where is he?

20:02.188 --> 20:03.817
I need to talk to him right now.

20:03.842 --> 20:05.219
You really think you're in any position

20:05.243 --> 20:06.911
to call me up, making demands?

20:06.978 --> 20:10.044
- Where is he, Kenji?
- I don't know, but even if I did...

20:10.069 --> 20:11.877
- What about Siobhan?
- Who?

20:11.925 --> 20:14.361
Damn it, Kenji, I don't
have time to play games.

20:14.386 --> 20:16.267
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:16.292 --> 20:18.565
Siobhan is Captain Lou Grover's niece.

20:19.088 --> 20:21.158
Apparently, she and
Endo have been dating.

20:21.268 --> 20:23.069
For now, let's leave aside the fact

20:23.094 --> 20:24.972
that you have a sleeper
enrolled at the academy,

20:24.996 --> 20:26.730
because last night, Siobhan went missing

20:26.755 --> 20:28.775
shortly after paying a
visit to Endo's house.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.402
So, you can see why it's
urgent that I speak to him.

20:31.427 --> 20:32.767
This is all news to me.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.438
Well, I suggest you get up to speed.

20:34.658 --> 20:37.808
Locate Endo as soon as possible
and hope to God Siobhan is okay.

20:37.833 --> 20:40.001
Because if we don't get
her back safe and sound,

20:40.026 --> 20:41.421
this alliance,

20:41.446 --> 20:43.247
this deal I made with Ryo?

20:43.358 --> 20:44.925
Everything is off the table.

20:44.950 --> 20:46.650
And there will be hell to pay for you.

20:46.675 --> 20:47.828
I promise you that!

21:02.385 --> 21:03.343
Hey.

21:03.877 --> 21:05.744
- Hey.
- I'm...

21:05.769 --> 21:08.349
I-I'm really sorry I didn't tell
you about the boyfriend thing.

21:08.373 --> 21:09.907
Oh, Tani, it's not your fault.

21:09.932 --> 21:11.674
I'm sorry, I...

21:13.978 --> 21:15.355
I shouldn't have
spoken to you like that.

21:15.380 --> 21:17.605
I was out of line.
I apologize.

21:20.261 --> 21:22.696
You know, Siobhan's father Mike and I

21:22.721 --> 21:25.728
have been tight since the fifth grade.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.557
And it wasn't easy, but... he finally

21:32.439 --> 21:34.574
started wrapping his
head around the idea

21:34.606 --> 21:37.375
that... this is what Siobhan wants

21:37.435 --> 21:39.455
for her life, you know?

21:40.665 --> 21:43.968
And he's trusting me to look after her.

21:47.448 --> 21:51.649
When I think about the fact
that I may have to call him

21:51.759 --> 21:52.859
a-and tell him

21:52.884 --> 21:55.323
- that his daughter...
- Lou.

21:55.353 --> 21:58.656
- Is...
- Lou, don't ever think that.

21:58.681 --> 22:01.574
Do you hear me? Don't think that.

22:01.769 --> 22:03.670
We're gonna find her.

22:04.046 --> 22:06.047
Lou, Bonnie's coming home.

22:13.071 --> 22:15.539
All right, so Endo is officially MIA.

22:15.607 --> 22:16.874
His phone is switched off.

22:16.899 --> 22:19.000
HPD has confirmed that he's not at home,

22:19.025 --> 22:21.087
and there's no news on Siobhan.

22:21.112 --> 22:22.913
I spoke to the Academy. Uh, he's due

22:22.938 --> 22:24.624
for a class at 11:00 a.m.

22:24.649 --> 22:26.317
Yeah, assuming he shows.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.461
Tani, do us a favor, reach
out to Duke, make sure

22:28.486 --> 22:30.869
he's got HPD officers standing
by to grab Endo as soon as we

22:30.894 --> 22:32.524
- get his location.
- Yeah, you got it.

22:32.591 --> 22:34.860
- HPD just located Siobhan's car.
- Where?

22:34.885 --> 22:37.537
Parked near the Pamalele
Bridge. Her cell phone

22:37.562 --> 22:40.049
and her purse were found
in the passenger footwell.

22:42.233 --> 22:44.535
Car keys were left in the ignition.

22:44.603 --> 22:47.004
CSU's doing a full forensic
search of the car as we speak.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.072
They'll reach out to
us as soon as they have

22:49.097 --> 22:50.264
anything that can help us.

23:20.627 --> 23:22.282
Brought you some food as well.

23:22.307 --> 23:23.711
You should eat something.

23:26.677 --> 23:28.321
I should eat?

23:28.981 --> 23:31.349
You got me tied to a chair.

23:32.846 --> 23:35.486
Stop pretending like you
give a damn about me, Endo.

23:35.553 --> 23:37.254
Siobhan, you don't understand, okay?

23:37.322 --> 23:39.213
After what you saw, I
didn't have a choice.

23:39.238 --> 23:41.940
Endo, you have to believe
me, I didn't see anything.

23:43.112 --> 23:45.252
Endo, this ain't you.

23:46.557 --> 23:48.143
Just let me go.

23:48.940 --> 23:52.609
I promise I won't say
nothing... to nobody.

23:55.873 --> 23:57.374
I can't take that chance.

23:58.877 --> 24:02.305
The cops, my uncle,

24:02.790 --> 24:04.958
they're probably already looking for me.

24:04.983 --> 24:06.350
How long do you think it'll be

24:06.375 --> 24:07.875
before they come asking questions?

24:08.274 --> 24:09.922
Have you thought about that?

24:10.622 --> 24:12.656
Endo, listen to me.

24:12.724 --> 24:14.658
There's only one thing left to do here.

24:14.683 --> 24:17.008
Stop trying to get inside my head!

24:19.635 --> 24:23.282
Why'd you have to go
and ruin everything?

24:24.707 --> 24:26.047
Go on then.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.010
Do what you got to do.

24:44.122 --> 24:46.044
You didn't bring me out here to kill me.

24:47.025 --> 24:48.497
You brought me here
because you're scared

24:48.522 --> 24:50.544
and you're in over your head,

24:50.762 --> 24:52.865
but, Endo, you can trust me.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.634
Whatever it is that you're
wrapped up in, I promise

24:57.659 --> 25:00.005
I've kept my mouth
shut about a lot worse.

25:00.771 --> 25:02.082
Come on, babe,

25:03.419 --> 25:06.411
just untie me and let's figure this out.

25:06.778 --> 25:10.981
Okay, yeah. All right.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.974
Endo.

25:15.227 --> 25:16.727
No.

25:19.505 --> 25:22.493
K-Kenji, hey.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.660
What have you done?

25:23.728 --> 25:25.729
I'm sorry. I was, I
was gonna tell you...

25:25.754 --> 25:27.888
That you're dating the
niece of a member of Five-O?

25:28.255 --> 25:30.310
Or that she's missing right now?

25:30.335 --> 25:31.479
The cops are looking for you.

25:31.503 --> 25:34.705
After everything we
did to get you in HPD,

25:34.730 --> 25:36.163
to protect your identity,

25:36.188 --> 25:38.189
you go and do something
stupid like this.

25:38.966 --> 25:42.371
- Is she still alive?
- Yeah. Yeah, but I-I...

25:42.396 --> 25:44.715
She saw me last night with Haru.

25:44.740 --> 25:46.540
She may have heard things, I don't know.

25:46.565 --> 25:48.166
Where did you take her?

25:50.744 --> 25:53.366
_

25:53.638 --> 25:58.362
- Where is she?
- The cabin in Mokuleia.

25:58.471 --> 26:01.941
I'll take care of this
now, you understand?

26:02.880 --> 26:05.536
- Yeah. I understand.
- Good.

26:05.561 --> 26:07.904
Now here's what I need from you.

26:08.540 --> 26:11.615
Whatever it is you
would normally do today,

26:11.919 --> 26:13.520
do it.

26:13.545 --> 26:17.400
Act like nothing's
changed. Is that clear?

26:17.425 --> 26:18.825
Yes, sir.

26:22.754 --> 26:24.575
Endo,

26:25.990 --> 26:27.291
who was that?

26:27.537 --> 26:29.672
I'm really sorry.

26:32.406 --> 26:33.540
No.

26:33.565 --> 26:35.132
Endo, don't leave me.

26:35.157 --> 26:36.575
Endo!

26:37.402 --> 26:38.602
Hey.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.838
CSU just finished looking
into Siobhan's car.

26:40.863 --> 26:42.358
It's clean for blood and foreign DNA.

26:42.383 --> 26:43.683
What do you guys got?

26:43.708 --> 26:44.808
Uh, yeah, good news.

26:44.876 --> 26:47.130
HPD intercepted Endo
en route to the Academy.

26:49.322 --> 26:51.991
Okay, yeah. That's-that's
good news. Where is he now?

26:52.016 --> 26:54.284
Downstairs. Steve and Lou
are about to question him.

27:09.758 --> 27:12.070
We pinged your phone last night,

27:12.094 --> 27:14.438
a quarter mile from your place.

27:14.538 --> 27:17.040
You already admitted Siobhan
came to see you last night.

27:17.366 --> 27:18.733
You really expect me to believe

27:18.758 --> 27:22.045
you don't know where she
went after she saw you?

27:22.070 --> 27:24.288
I really don't know.

27:24.313 --> 27:26.047
Captain Grover, I know
you're upset, but...

27:26.072 --> 27:27.906
- Oh, do you now? Do you? I'm...
- Lou. Lou.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.151
I'm good.

27:30.617 --> 27:31.766
Why don't you tell us

27:31.791 --> 27:33.789
what happened when Siobhan
came to your place last night?

27:34.477 --> 27:35.948
Siobhan calls me,

27:36.531 --> 27:38.760
says she wants to talk.

27:38.785 --> 27:40.986
Truth is, things haven't
been going really well for us

27:41.054 --> 27:42.154
the last couple weeks.

27:42.844 --> 27:45.124
I put up a front for as long as I could,

27:45.149 --> 27:46.817
but last night,

27:47.117 --> 27:48.603
I ended it.

27:48.628 --> 27:50.914
You know, things, they
just weren't working out.

27:52.008 --> 27:55.210
I did it as gently as I possibly could.

27:55.235 --> 27:59.190
Now, Siobhan, she didn't
take it so well. She cried.

27:59.215 --> 28:01.483
- She Cr...
- A lot.

28:01.508 --> 28:05.229
You know, she was distraught
when she left my place. I...

28:05.254 --> 28:08.390
Obviously, I offered to drive her home,

28:08.657 --> 28:10.391
but she refused.

28:10.459 --> 28:12.427
Yeah, I figured she
just needed some time.

28:13.992 --> 28:16.221
But now I-I'm hearing

28:16.246 --> 28:17.945
she's-she's gone missing?

28:17.970 --> 28:20.271
I'm really worried.

28:22.284 --> 28:25.353
You don't think she
hurt herself, do you?

28:26.365 --> 28:28.359
Over your punk ass?

28:29.661 --> 28:33.070
Boy, choose your next words

28:33.469 --> 28:35.648
- really carefully.
- All right, look,

28:35.673 --> 28:37.078
if everything you're
saying is the truth,

28:37.086 --> 28:39.658
where were you this morning?
Why was your phone off?

28:39.683 --> 28:42.453
I go for a run every morning
along the Manana Ridge Trail.

28:42.478 --> 28:43.522
There's no service up there anyway,

28:43.547 --> 28:46.415
so I turn my off phone to save battery.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.374
Mm-hmm. How about that
second phone, though?

28:48.485 --> 28:50.996
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

28:51.301 --> 28:53.632
That second phone, the
phone Siobhan saw you with

28:53.657 --> 28:55.435
when you thought she wasn't
looking, what about that phone,

28:55.459 --> 28:56.625
you turn that one off, too?

28:56.982 --> 28:59.504
I don't have another phone.

29:00.818 --> 29:01.911
All right.

29:03.568 --> 29:04.910
Just sit tight, Endo.

29:04.935 --> 29:06.202
We're gonna vet your story.

29:06.509 --> 29:09.538
Of course. Yo, all I care
about is Bonnie's safety.

29:09.606 --> 29:11.507
Bonn...  Hey!

29:11.532 --> 29:14.844
You think I'm buying any
of this cock-and-bull story

29:14.911 --> 29:16.645
about you breaking up with my niece

29:16.713 --> 29:18.681
like you were putting
your damn dog to sleep,

29:18.748 --> 29:19.949
you little son of a bitch?

29:20.016 --> 29:22.017
Let me find out you
lying about that phone.

29:22.085 --> 29:23.853
I swear on everything,

29:23.878 --> 29:25.546
I'll bring it back here and stick it

29:25.571 --> 29:28.707
where it don't come out! Lou, hey!

29:29.662 --> 29:31.681
You little son of a bitch.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.543
Lou, so HPD is still canvassing
the area where they found

29:38.568 --> 29:40.870
Siobhan's car. So far,
they've come up empty.

29:40.937 --> 29:43.138
They also sent divers to dredge

29:43.163 --> 29:45.498
the canal, but... Lou, hey, hey,

29:45.523 --> 29:47.300
it's only because of where
the car was found, okay?

29:47.325 --> 29:48.826
It's protocol in these situations.

29:48.851 --> 29:50.731
Good news is they haven't
found anything yet,

29:50.756 --> 29:51.756
and they're not going to.

29:52.395 --> 29:53.182
I don't believe

29:53.250 --> 29:56.780
one word out of that lying
little son of a bitch's mouth.

29:56.805 --> 29:59.321
The location they found Siobhan's car is

29:59.346 --> 30:01.367
all the proof I need that
he's mixed up in this.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.726
Why else would he try to make me think

30:03.751 --> 30:05.219
that Siobhan might've killed herself?

30:05.244 --> 30:08.447
Because he parked her car himself

30:08.641 --> 30:11.343
at that location to give
that exact impression.

30:11.368 --> 30:14.190
All right, Lou, uh,
we also, uh, ran his phone.

30:14.215 --> 30:17.791
He, um, apparently powered
it off last night at 8:05,

30:17.816 --> 30:19.417
which is around the same time

30:19.442 --> 30:21.043
that Siobhan's phone was powered off.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.579
Well, that's interesting
'cause he just told us

30:22.604 --> 30:25.072
he turned his phone off this
morning when he went for a run.

30:25.181 --> 30:27.082
Because he thinks he's smart.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.794
He shut down his phone the same time

30:29.819 --> 30:31.353
he shut Siobhan's phone down

30:31.378 --> 30:34.013
because he didn't want
anybody tracking where

30:34.038 --> 30:35.538
he was taking her.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.627
All right, Lou, look, everything
you're saying makes sense,

30:39.219 --> 30:41.030
but you know as well as
I do we don't have enough

30:41.097 --> 30:42.464
on this kid to charge him with yet.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.309
What about that second phone?

30:44.956 --> 30:46.835
That second phone that Bonnie
saw him with? What're we do...

30:46.903 --> 30:48.737
We doing anything about that at all?

30:48.762 --> 30:51.589
HPD tore the house up. Quinn and
Tani are still looking, though.

30:55.913 --> 30:57.956
Take it that wasn't the
first time you've done that.

30:57.981 --> 31:00.583
Oh, yeah, I used to lock
my keys in the car a lot.

31:04.664 --> 31:06.888
Okay, Endo, let's see what we've got.

31:06.913 --> 31:09.491
You know, I thought having
two cell phones meant

31:09.559 --> 31:11.093
that this guy was just a player.

31:11.118 --> 31:13.119
No idea it could be something darker.

31:13.229 --> 31:15.925
Well, let's hope your
first instinct was right.

31:19.369 --> 31:21.170
I don't know. I mean,
I saw them together,

31:21.195 --> 31:23.497
and they were, like,
totally flirty, you know,

31:23.522 --> 31:25.784
how people are when
they first start dating,

31:25.809 --> 31:27.509
they're super into each other.

31:27.534 --> 31:29.936
So no indication they were on the rocks?

31:30.226 --> 31:31.226
Exactly.

31:34.422 --> 31:35.451
I got nothing.

31:36.101 --> 31:39.355
Well, bad guys tend
to be pretty creative

31:39.380 --> 31:41.539
when they're hiding things in a car.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.277
Oh.

31:51.923 --> 31:53.056
Well, what do you know?

31:58.527 --> 32:00.809
Nice to finally see a friendly face.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.311
Forget prison.

32:02.336 --> 32:04.937
If anything happens to
Siobhan, you're as good as dead.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.359
You're not in a position
to make threats, Noshimuri,

32:07.384 --> 32:10.997
just... keep your mouth shut,
this all goes away soon enough.

32:11.021 --> 32:11.954
What does that mean?

32:11.979 --> 32:13.980
Means it's being taken care of.

32:15.403 --> 32:17.168
You told Kenji where she is?

32:17.849 --> 32:18.886
Listen to me

32:18.911 --> 32:21.463
very carefully, Endo, 'cause
I'm only gonna ask once.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.441
Where's Siobhan?

32:23.466 --> 32:26.058
If I don't tell you, then what?

32:26.083 --> 32:28.613
Are you gonna tell your
friends how we know each other?

32:28.638 --> 32:31.152
How do you think that's
gonna work out for you?

33:05.843 --> 33:08.025
Boss, you're gonna want
to take a look at this.

33:10.413 --> 33:11.535
Tani, what is it?

33:11.965 --> 33:14.934
Just ran Endo's secret burner
and things got interesting fast.

33:15.060 --> 33:18.329
Several of the numbers came back
to individuals in the system.

33:18.354 --> 33:20.973
All of these gentlemen
have one thing in common.

33:21.643 --> 33:23.582
They all have ties to the Yakuza.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.157
Is it taken care of?

35:02.224 --> 35:03.892
You better hope not.

35:03.917 --> 35:06.382
I have your godson in
the trunk of my car.

35:06.407 --> 35:08.674
I'm taking him to a nice,
secluded spot in the jungle

35:08.699 --> 35:10.550
where he's gonna dig himself a hole.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.709
Then I'm gonna put a bullet
in his head and bury him.

35:12.734 --> 35:15.135
That would be a big mistake.

35:15.332 --> 35:17.266
One that you would
pay for with your life.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.445
Yeah, well, in case you haven't
been paying attention, Kenji,

35:19.469 --> 35:21.155
I'm not afraid of much these days.

35:21.180 --> 35:22.414
What do you want?

35:22.439 --> 35:23.706
An exchange.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.541
Endo for Siobhan.

35:25.652 --> 35:28.086
Or your godson's blood
will be on your hands.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.588
Here's good.

36:18.825 --> 36:20.559
Yeah?

36:23.434 --> 36:24.495
Okay.

36:24.879 --> 36:26.312
Change of plans.

36:40.505 --> 36:42.440
What the hell would make him do this?

36:45.876 --> 36:47.313
How do you explain that?

36:48.964 --> 36:50.230
I obviously can't.

36:50.648 --> 36:51.936
It doesn't make sense.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.606
Well, there's got to be
a reason why he did it.

36:53.630 --> 36:54.897
Because he's involved.

36:54.964 --> 36:57.414
- He's working for the Yakuza now.
- I'm calling Adam.

37:02.907 --> 37:03.907
It's him.

37:07.561 --> 37:08.787
What are you doing, man?

37:08.812 --> 37:10.690
Lou, listen to me. I'm
going to get Siobhan back,

37:10.714 --> 37:12.481
but to do that I have to give them Endo.

37:12.549 --> 37:13.934
So you just took him?!

37:13.959 --> 37:15.960
You didn't think to loop
us in on your little plan?

37:15.985 --> 37:17.771
That's my niece's life
you're playing with!

37:17.796 --> 37:18.863
Trust me, I'm aware.

37:18.888 --> 37:20.589
Look, it had to be done this way.

37:20.614 --> 37:21.976
They'll only deal with me.

37:22.001 --> 37:23.902
If they even suspect
Five-O is involved,

37:23.927 --> 37:25.861
they won't hesitate,
Lou... They'll kill her.

37:25.929 --> 37:28.073
But that's not going to happen.

37:28.098 --> 37:29.575
I'm going to text you where to meet me.

37:29.599 --> 37:30.876
By the time you make it out there,

37:30.900 --> 37:32.167
I'll have her back safely.

37:32.344 --> 37:34.343
- You better.
- I know.

37:37.628 --> 37:39.317
Look, you know

37:39.342 --> 37:41.494
I've had my doubts about
Adam for a while now.

37:43.179 --> 37:46.204
But if he says he has a plan,
my gut says he's gonna deliver.

37:47.050 --> 37:49.718
Well, I'm gonna tell
you just like I told him.

37:49.786 --> 37:51.553
He better. 'Cause if he's

37:51.621 --> 37:54.523
mixed up in any of this, or
if Siobhan ends up getting hurt

37:54.591 --> 37:56.258
because of this move he just made,

37:56.326 --> 37:58.761
I'm telling you, hand to God,

37:58.786 --> 38:01.889
he ain't comin' out of them damn woods.

38:13.535 --> 38:14.869
She walks first.

38:15.123 --> 38:17.458
Out to the middle. Then I send him.

38:18.802 --> 38:19.882
Right now!

38:19.949 --> 38:21.750
Siobhan, walk.

38:21.861 --> 38:24.362
You lucked out, kid. She's alive,

38:24.387 --> 38:26.155
so you get to live, too.

38:26.222 --> 38:29.007
Now, walk. And do not stop.

38:46.799 --> 38:49.134
That's right Siobhan, just keep walking.

38:50.113 --> 38:51.280
Come on.

39:11.334 --> 39:13.327
Right around here's
where Adam told me...

39:13.768 --> 39:14.975
to meet him.

39:18.098 --> 39:19.331
Lou.

39:19.909 --> 39:21.276
Bonnie!

39:22.849 --> 39:23.712
Bonnie!

39:23.881 --> 39:25.381
Uncle Lou!

39:27.179 --> 39:28.546
Uncle Lou.

39:30.728 --> 39:32.195
Oh, thank God.

39:33.266 --> 39:34.666
Thank God.

39:34.886 --> 39:36.019
Hey.

39:37.570 --> 39:39.704
You listen to me.

39:39.729 --> 39:41.296
The next time you decide

39:41.321 --> 39:43.923
to go out and get yourself a boyfriend,

39:43.948 --> 39:46.477
you tell me... so I can check him out

39:46.502 --> 39:48.270
and see if he's good enough

39:48.295 --> 39:49.428
for my niece.

39:52.480 --> 39:53.909
I love you so much.

39:54.230 --> 39:56.378
I love you, Uncle Lou.

40:06.030 --> 40:07.237
Let's go.

40:08.316 --> 40:09.374
You all right?

40:37.224 --> 40:39.359
Yeah, good boy.

40:43.559 --> 40:44.760
Yo.

40:44.827 --> 40:46.744
Hey. You want some coffee?

40:47.248 --> 40:50.508
No. I feel like I'm a hundred.
I got to hydrate first.

40:50.799 --> 40:53.278
What, uh, what's going
on with breakfast?

40:53.303 --> 40:55.871
Not much. You're late, so I
gave your breakfast to Eddie.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.384
I'd say that that's funny, but
I don't think you're kidding.

40:59.994 --> 41:01.543
- Do I look like I'm kidding?
- No.

41:01.611 --> 41:04.446
This is not my joking face. I
just got a call from the Duke.

41:04.826 --> 41:07.091
They did a deep dive into
Endo's time at the academy.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.174
That kid, while he
was there, hacked into

41:09.199 --> 41:11.087
HPD's central database.
They're still trying

41:11.112 --> 41:13.192
to figure out how much data
was actually compromised.

41:13.332 --> 41:16.935
Ah. Well, you know, uh,
what this means, right?

41:16.960 --> 41:19.261
Yeah, I do. Endo could be the reason

41:19.286 --> 41:22.221
the Yakuza is up on us knowing
about that burial ground.

41:22.375 --> 41:24.414
Could be. You-you
still think that Adam,

41:24.439 --> 41:26.245
after what he did getting
Siobhan out of there,

41:26.270 --> 41:28.404
you think that he's still
working with those people?

41:30.442 --> 41:33.108
You can grunt once for
yes or twice for no.

41:33.219 --> 41:34.252
What, y-you're quite

41:34.277 --> 41:35.844
the conversationalist this morning.

41:35.912 --> 41:38.324
I'm better off talking
to the dog. No disrespect,

41:38.349 --> 41:40.058
Eddie.

41:40.083 --> 41:41.493
Do me a favor, don't eat my breakfast

41:41.517 --> 41:42.718
- next time, huh?
- Do me a favor,

41:42.784 --> 41:44.395
- don't shame my dog.
- I'm not shaming your dog.

41:44.420 --> 41:45.798
I'm cooking you eggs, all right?

41:45.823 --> 41:47.522
Thank you. You don't have to do that.

41:48.118 --> 41:50.792
But if you're gonna do
it, I'll take scrambled.

41:50.860 --> 41:52.961
- And I'd like...
- And a little burnt, right?

41:53.029 --> 41:54.930
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:54.998 --> 41:58.266
Well, I got a... text
from my contractor.

41:58.291 --> 41:59.925
He, uh, he told me everything's going...

41:59.950 --> 42:01.450
going good over at the house.

42:01.647 --> 42:02.914
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

42:02.939 --> 42:05.393
I got the floorboards
back in, running water.

42:05.418 --> 42:06.351
It's livable.

42:06.376 --> 42:07.909
Mm-hmm. Good.

42:08.411 --> 42:11.789
So I could probably get
out of your space soon if...

42:11.814 --> 42:13.382
They paint it yet?

42:13.407 --> 42:14.541
Any paint?

42:14.566 --> 42:15.726
They didn't paint it yet, no.

42:15.751 --> 42:16.884
No paint? Mmmm.

42:17.053 --> 42:18.153
Furniture?

42:18.221 --> 42:20.088
- Storage.
- Don't be crazy, all right?

42:20.156 --> 42:21.967
You're not gonna live in there
with workmen running around.

42:21.991 --> 42:23.535
Just stay here. Stay for
another couple of weeks.

42:23.559 --> 42:25.827
You can stay here as long you
want, you know that, right?

42:26.009 --> 42:27.605
Thank you. I appreciate that.

42:27.630 --> 42:28.816
You're welcome.

42:28.841 --> 42:31.501
I'll stay, maybe to hang out with Eddie,

42:31.526 --> 42:33.974
so he's not so lonely, 'cause
you're not very good company.

42:34.349 --> 42:35.515
You know, uh,

42:35.540 --> 42:37.605
the eggs, um, you-you could burn 'em

42:37.630 --> 42:39.530
without cremating them,
you know what I mean?

42:39.555 --> 42:41.423
You could keep a little fluff.

42:41.448 --> 42:43.126
You get what you get,
and you don't get upset.

42:43.151 --> 42:44.407
I know, but I'm gonna be
upset if you ruin my eggs.

42:44.432 --> 42:45.309
Why don't you come

42:45.334 --> 42:46.865
- and cook your own eggs?
- No, I want you to cook the eggs

42:46.890 --> 42:48.297
- like you said you were...
- I think I'm regretting

42:48.322 --> 42:49.752
- that decision now.
- The hell's the matter with you?

42:49.777 --> 42:50.952
The matter with me?
What's the matter with you?

42:50.976 --> 42:52.220
- Why are you such a maniac?
- You're a maniac.

42:52.244 --> 42:53.488
- You're a maniac. You're a maniac.
- I'm a maniac?

42:53.512 --> 42:54.512
Can I have bacon?

42:54.546 --> 42:56.147
- No bacon for you.
- Why not?

42:56.172 --> 42:58.388
'Cause I don't... it's not a bacon day.

42:58.413 --> 42:59.833
You really are a maniac.
