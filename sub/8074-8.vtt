00:07.908 --> 00:11.479
Are you sure you want to
go on this parents weekend?

00:11.512 --> 00:13.481
I'll be here all alone.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.615
I'll miss you.

00:14.648 --> 00:18.986
There's a 12-pack
chilling in the fridge.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.556
And you are--

00:22.590 --> 00:24.558
Now, don't you go calling
Darlene and tipping her off

00:24.592 --> 00:26.026
that I'm headed down
there, because I

00:26.060 --> 00:28.196
want to meet this Jimmy
guy she's going with.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.198
And I do not want to
give her time to sober

00:30.231 --> 00:32.766
him up and hide her kids.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.337
Hey, why aren't you
wearing any shoes, boy?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.172
I don't want to wear shoes.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.607
Well you're gonna.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.277
We've been wearing shoes in
this family for two generations.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.912
Well, this big kid
said he'd beat me

00:44.945 --> 00:46.747
up unless I gave him my shoes.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.981
Mark, will you come
to school with me

00:48.015 --> 00:49.417
tomorrow and beat him up?

00:49.450 --> 00:52.520
Nah, it wouldn't be fair for
me to beat up the 12-year-old.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.489
Why don't you ask David?

00:55.523 --> 00:56.657
Don't worry, DJ.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.092
I'll teach you how to fight?

00:58.126 --> 01:00.027
I don't want to learn.

01:00.060 --> 01:07.835
Uh-- Mr. Conner, do you
think you could possibly--

01:07.868 --> 01:09.803
I don't know, is there any
way you could-- you could

01:09.837 --> 01:12.306
teach me how to fight, too?

01:12.340 --> 01:14.375
Maybe.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.844
Sure, David, I could
teach you a few things.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.679
Some of the old patented
Dan Conner moves.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.219
But that would be wrong.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.155
Why?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.190
Well, I-- I have my reasons.

01:29.223 --> 01:38.666
And those reasons are
plentiful and mysterious.

01:38.699 --> 01:39.900
OK, thanks anyway.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.038
Do I get to know my reasons?

01:45.072 --> 01:47.375
OK Darlene's going out
with this boxer, right?

01:47.408 --> 01:50.311
So David thinks if he gets to
be a tough guy, that Darlene

01:50.344 --> 01:53.080
will want him back.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.483
See, David needs to find
somebody that will love him

01:55.516 --> 01:56.917
for just being David, you know.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.920
He shouldn't have to
think about changing.

01:59.953 --> 02:04.758
So while I'm gone, your mission,
should you choose to accept,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.528
is to make David feel
good about being David.

02:07.561 --> 02:12.166
OK, by the way,
can you tell me

02:12.200 --> 02:18.506
some things about being David
that he could feel good about.

02:21.108 --> 02:24.612
Well, you know, there's his
drawing, you know, his art.

02:24.645 --> 02:30.351
And he sits in front of
the TV for a long time.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.887
So he's got a very good,
long attention span.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.558
Groovy, I can work with that.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.660
Goodbye house.

02:39.693 --> 02:40.794
Bye, Mrs. Conner.

02:40.828 --> 02:41.995
Bye.

02:42.029 --> 02:44.532
Dan, I'll be counting the
kids when I come back.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.800
We better not be missing
more than a couple of them

02:46.834 --> 02:48.569
when I come back.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.642
Hey, David,
that's really good.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.543
What is that?

02:55.576 --> 02:57.245
A horse?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.213
Well it's not just
a horse, Mr. Conner.

02:59.247 --> 03:03.116
It's supposed to represent
power and movement and freedom.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.918
See, I'm trying to
show the wild spirit

03:04.952 --> 03:07.455
that's inside of all of us but
we're afraid to acknowledge.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.993
He got a name?

[theme music playing]

04:01.241 --> 04:04.111
You can give into
your fear, or you'll

04:04.144 --> 04:06.614
be afraid your whole life.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.581
I'm not afraid of this guy.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.917
I know just how to handle him.

04:09.950 --> 04:10.818
Show me.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.652
I'm going to cry.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.389
You can't cry.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.790
Sure, I can.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.791
I can cry real good.

04:17.825 --> 04:18.992
And he'll look
pretty stupid hitting

04:19.026 --> 04:22.062
a guy who's already crying.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.700
Now, son, fighting a
bully is just a normal part

04:26.734 --> 04:28.836
of growing up and being a man.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.905
So if I never fight
him, I'll never be a man.

04:31.939 --> 04:32.840
Yeah, you'll be a man.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.643
You'll just be a
man without shoes.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.910
Well I don't want to get hit.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.312
It'll hurt.

Come on, DJ.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.015
I know a little pain
doesn't bother you.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.651
I've seen you go to the
doctor to get shots.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.885
I hate getting shots.

04:44.918 --> 04:48.155
Is it going to hurt as
much as getting a shot?

04:48.188 --> 04:52.926
Damn it, DJ, when everybody
finds out that you're not going

04:52.960 --> 04:55.363
to fight, they're going to
come from all over to start

04:55.396 --> 04:56.430

I'll do something.

- Stop it.
- Make me.

you going to do?

05:54.722 --> 05:57.224
Hey, that's my shirt.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.527
She stole that from me.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.762
I told you that guy was
a bad influence on her.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.565
Now, you don't
know that he's bad.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.266
She hasn't told me
one thing about him.

I had to make up myself.

your mother's dead?

us he was a dancer.

you're ashamed of them.

Darlene I wish I'd

I was wondering,

09:29.603 --> 09:31.805
do you think there's any way
I could get a motorcycle?

09:31.839 --> 09:34.675
I've been thinking about either
a Harley Davidson or a hog.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.544
Hogs are Harleys.

09:37.577 --> 09:42.349
Oh, that's probably why the
guy at the store laughed at me.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.618
David, I know why
you're doing this.

09:44.652 --> 09:47.187
You think having a bike will
make you look all tough.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.088
No.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.757
That's not true, no way.

I mean, unless it had like big
flames painted on the side.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.596
Come on, Dan, you had a
bike when you were his age.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.098
Chicks love a guy on a bike.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.366
David doesn't want
that kind of girl

If you don't believe me, take a
good, long look at Mrs. Conner.

OK, I thought
you'd like the idea.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.714
Ah, I get it.

You don't want him to
get a bike because you

11:14.607 --> 11:15.909
have released his anger at me.

11:15.943 --> 11:20.513
This way, he'll direct it at
the bully where it belongs.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.015
You're amazing.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.250
No.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.217
Just a parent.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.586
A parent who goes
from town to town,

11:26.619 --> 11:28.655
helping out, then moving on.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.625
My only hope, the kids are
raised just a tiny little

11:32.659 --> 11:35.195
better because I was there.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.096
DAVID: Hey.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.967
Hey, DJ, stop it.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.968
Help me.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.435
Somebody get him off me.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.404
DJ, what the
hell are you doing?

11:44.437 --> 11:46.373
God, this feels great.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.341
Now I now why this
kid took my shoes.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.681
DJ, what's the
matter with you?

11:54.714 --> 11:55.883
Man, what happened?

11:55.916 --> 11:56.817
Nothing.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.887
DJ accidentally
knocked him down.

11:59.920 --> 12:00.821
He's lying.

12:00.854 --> 12:01.721
I kicked his but.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.990
Here, I'll show you again--

12:03.023 --> 12:04.724
That's enough.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.026
He caught me off guard.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.060
Oh, what?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.863
Did he hit you while
you were knitting?

12:09.897 --> 12:11.865
Well, I wasn't going to
pick on some little kid.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.467
Well, I wasn't going to
pick on some little kid.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.402
Mark, out.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.904
DJ, upstairs.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.305
Careful, David.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.907
I hear there's a seven-year-old
roaming around the neighborhood

12:19.940 --> 12:20.841
just looking for trouble.

12:25.178 --> 12:25.979
You need some ice?

12:34.988 --> 12:37.024
Boy, David's really upset.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.291
What are you going to do, Dan?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.927
Why do you keep asking
me what I'm going to do.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.095
What is it with you
and all the questions?

12:42.129 --> 12:43.230
Why can't a guy
just do what he's

12:43.263 --> 12:44.264
got to do without being asked?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.736
You don't know what
to do, do you, Dan?

12:55.042 --> 12:57.544
You've just been doing what
Roseanne told you to do,

12:57.577 --> 12:58.378
haven't you?

13:03.216 --> 13:05.785
You're really a very bad
father, aren't you, Dan?

13:05.819 --> 13:08.889
No, I'm not.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.958
I just don't know
what to do with David.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.826
He scares me, Fred.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.062
I mean, he's probably down
there right now crying

13:15.095 --> 13:17.030
or reading or drawing a horse.

13:17.064 --> 13:20.033
Well, why don't you do what
you were trying to do before?

13:20.067 --> 13:22.535
You know, raise his self-esteem.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.504
I don't know how
to give a 17-year-old

13:24.537 --> 13:28.842
who's just been beaten up by
a 12-year-old self-esteem.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.011
I don't even know
how to give him hope.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.645
Well, just tell him
that getting beaten up

13:32.679 --> 13:35.348
by a little kid is not going
to make him any less attractive

13:35.382 --> 13:38.751
to Darlene or any other girl.
- That's good, Fred.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.888
They say it's best
to open with a joke.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.222
I mean it, Dan.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.992
You don't have to be a
big tough guy to be a man.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.593
Sometimes the strongest
guys in the world

13:46.626 --> 13:48.661
are the ones who aren't
afraid to be soft.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.531
Yeah, you're right.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.365
OK.

13:55.802 --> 13:56.937
But you know, if
this doesn't work,

13:56.970 --> 13:58.205
I'm going to have
to come back up here

13:58.238 --> 14:00.240
and kick the crap out of you.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.409
[music playing]

14:05.412 --> 14:07.614
I really liked
that recital, Jimmy.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.216
I had never been
to a ballet before.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.117
Thanks for taking us.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.018
Sure.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.485
Too bad it had to end so soon.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.523
I still have some feeling
in my left buttock.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.792
Now, Roseanne, I
know you enjoyed it.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.694
Well, it is every
mother's dream

14:21.728 --> 14:26.799
to get a good look at her
daughter's boyfriend's package.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.036
Very classy, Mom.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.439
Oh, come on, I wasn't making
fun of his beard or anything.

14:32.472 --> 14:36.809
You know, I didn't realize that
the Amish were aloud to dance.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.678
Would you excuse
us for a second.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.048
We want to buy a knick
knack for the bathroom.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
And we need to see
what the theme is.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.222
You-- you-- you've got
to give Jimmy a chance.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.723
You've been sniping
at him all day.

14:50.757 --> 14:51.624
What's the matter?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.760
Are you feeling left out?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.062
You're not being fair.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.165
You expected some horrible
guy, the opposite of David.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.667
And if anything, he's
a lot like David.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.869
Well, if he's so
much like David,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.838
then why doesn't
she just date David.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.340
Is that what this is about?

15:07.374 --> 15:09.509
You want her to be David
so you don't like anybody.

15:09.542 --> 15:10.777
No.

15:10.810 --> 15:16.049
I don't like anybody,
because I don't like anybody.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.317
You like David?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.285
Well, of course, I do.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.852
He's the nicest
boy in the world.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.321
And I think he was
good for Darlene.

15:21.354 --> 15:24.157
Well, Jimmy might
be good for you.

15:24.191 --> 15:26.693
Yeah, so what if
he's not good for me?

15:26.726 --> 15:29.762
Look, Darlene is going to
bring a lot of different guys

15:29.796 --> 15:31.131
into your life.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.633
You're not going to love them
all the way you love David.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.667
I know that.

15:34.701 --> 15:39.239
But we were just all
so good together.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.507
She's not coming back.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.675
He's not coming back.

15:42.709 --> 15:46.446
You're the only one left
in their relationship.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.548
Give Jimmy a chance.

15:48.581 --> 15:49.382
All right.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.854
I guess a mother just
never really gets

15:54.887 --> 15:58.625
over her daughter's first love.

15:58.658 --> 16:01.361
[flushing sound]

16:01.394 --> 16:03.396
Well, I know what to get
somebody for their bathroom

16:03.430 --> 16:04.364
next time we visit.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.699
Yeah, Renuzit.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.800
That's it.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.036
You know, you've been
taking cracks at me

16:09.069 --> 16:10.303
and Darlene all day.
And I'm get pretty sick of it.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.738
Jimmy, now may
not be the time.

16:11.771 --> 16:12.839
No, no, Jackie.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.774
I'd like to hear what
the lad has to say.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.875
I am not a lad.

16:15.908 --> 16:16.843
I'm a man.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.478
And I'd wish you'd
treat me like one.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.080
Look, you may talk this
way to your own family.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.116
But when you're talking to
me, I demand a little respect.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.184
Now, I think you should leave.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.192
[laughter]

16:32.225 --> 16:34.194
[music playing]

16:34.227 --> 16:35.662
[knocking]

16:35.695 --> 16:38.665
DAN: David?

16:38.698 --> 16:39.532
Hey, David.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.007
So how's it going?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.413
I'm fine.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.682
You got nothing to
be embarrassed about.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.849
So you lost a fight.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.318
It happens to a lot of guys.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.787
It happened to DJ all the time--

17:00.820 --> 17:02.689
before he ran into you.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.957
Thanks a lot.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.726
Oh, look, there's
a lot of girls that

17:06.759 --> 17:08.495
aren't into this macho stuff.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.797
Look at those girls in Playboy.

17:10.830 --> 17:14.634
Their turn ons are always
poets and sensitive guys,

17:14.667 --> 17:17.170
crap like that.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.571
- Just leave me alone.
- I can't.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.472
Why can't you?

17:19.506 --> 17:21.541
Well, I got a good reason.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.975
And that good reason
is barreling right

17:23.009 --> 17:25.478
towards this house right about
now, about 70 miles an hour

17:25.512 --> 17:28.148
in a 55 zone, slurping
in a Big Gulp.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.654
So Mrs. Conner is
why you came down here.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.722
OK, I was wondering.

17:35.755 --> 17:36.756
What's that supposed to mean?

17:36.789 --> 17:38.225
Just get out, Mr. Conner.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.393
There's no way
I'm leaving now.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.195
I can throw you out if
that's what it's going to take.

17:53.940 --> 17:54.807
You done.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.843
Go to hell.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.479
Hey, you don't
talk to me that way.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.047
I came down here
to help you, boy.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.882
Oh, don't pretend
like you give a crap.

18:02.915 --> 18:04.317
You don't respect me
enough to give a crap.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.052
You never have.
- What are you talking--

18:06.085 --> 18:07.320
I don't respect you?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.221
I'm leaving.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.122
No, you're not.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.090
Wait a minute.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.861
Why is this all of a
sudden about me and you?

18:14.894 --> 18:18.565
I thought we were talking
about Darlene and you.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.500
Right?

18:20.533 --> 18:25.272
David, you've got
to help me out here.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.375
Mrs. Conner is real good about
figuring out people's feelings.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.076
But I'm not Mrs. Conner.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.146
I'm a regular person.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.714
Look, I know
it's weird for you

18:34.747 --> 18:36.849
having me living in your house,
especially now that I'm not

18:36.883 --> 18:38.084
going out with Darlene anymore.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.219
So?

18:39.252 --> 18:42.054
So I thought I'd make
things easier for us.

18:42.088 --> 18:45.057
Wait a minute.

18:45.091 --> 18:48.661
Is that what all this talk
about fighting and motorcycles

18:48.695 --> 18:50.530
was to impress me?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.232
I thought it would
make things less weird

18:52.265 --> 18:53.766
if we had stuff in common.

18:53.800 --> 18:57.404
You mean I figured it out?

18:57.437 --> 19:01.073
Hey, David, we don't have to
like the same stuff for me

19:01.107 --> 19:02.074
to respect you.

19:02.108 --> 19:02.975
Forget it.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.744
No, it's true.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.180
I mean, in high school I used
to be jealous of guys like you

19:07.214 --> 19:08.948
all the time,
because I knew deep

19:08.981 --> 19:10.250
down they were better than me.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.484
Oh, you're making that up.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.353
Of course, I am.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.055
But doesn't that prove how
much I like you that I'd

19:16.088 --> 19:19.926
make up such a ridiculous lie?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.294
I just figured you
were only letting

19:21.328 --> 19:23.496
me live here because Mrs.
Conner was making you.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.766
Listen, David, even if Mrs.
Conner wanted to throw you out,

19:26.799 --> 19:28.235
she'd have to
throw me out first.

19:28.268 --> 19:32.405
And I may not look like
much, but I'm wiry.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.306
You mean it?

19:33.340 --> 19:34.907
Absolutely.

19:34.941 --> 19:40.179
Hey, you're one of
the Conners now.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.714
Abandoned all hope.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.916
Sorry I took
that swing at you.

19:43.950 --> 19:44.751
No problem.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.155
You know this is great.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.056
Yeah?

19:50.089 --> 19:51.258
Yeah.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.493
We did something here that
our family rarely does.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.863
We solved a problem
without the cops.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.764
Good.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.466
Good.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.468
I mean, I feel
closer to you now.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.135
Yeah, me too.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.137
Yeah, this is great.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.239
And now that you
know how I feel,

20:06.273 --> 20:07.774
Mrs. Conner doesn't
have to be the only one

20:07.807 --> 20:08.975
you can talk to in this house.

20:09.008 --> 20:09.909
All right.

20:09.942 --> 20:17.884
Yeah

20:17.917 --> 20:18.985
When's Mrs.
Conner coming home?

20:19.018 --> 20:19.986
Soon.

20:20.019 --> 20:24.090
I better go see if
she's almost here.

20:24.123 --> 20:24.991
This is good.

20:25.024 --> 20:25.825
I know.

20:32.832 --> 20:34.334
You know, I got to
hand it to you, Dan.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.568
You've got this
parenting thing down.

20:35.602 --> 20:37.404
You're a great father.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.673
You're kind of like
the Great Dantini.

20:40.707 --> 20:41.608
Come on, Fred.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.242
You going to talk or play ball?

20:43.276 --> 20:45.845
You know, none of us have
ever beaten you in anything.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.716
Not softball, fixing cars,
not parenting, nothing.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.454
Game over.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.923
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.659
Come on, Jocko, you got
to win by two baskets.

20:59.692 --> 21:00.560
You said one.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.629
I changed my mind.

21:02.662 --> 21:03.563
Guard me.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.097
I'm not going
to guard you, Dan.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.999
I won.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.702
Hey, mama's boy.

21:09.736 --> 21:13.039
Mama's boy, you going to cry.

21:13.072 --> 21:16.275
Come on, mama's boy,
squirt me a few.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.278
Come on, let me see you cry.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.349
Come on, little girl,
one, two, three, cry.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.650
You're my favorite
sister-in-law, Fred.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.218
I swear to God, you're
my sweetest little girl.

21:33.159 --> 21:36.563
Fred, I don't you to think
of me as your commander.

21:36.596 --> 21:41.634
I want you to think
of me, as well, god.

21:41.668 --> 21:45.237
ROSEANNE: Dan, kids, I'm home.

21:45.271 --> 21:48.207
[whimpers]
