saying it's the same as Praxil,
well, it's not.

(Chuckles) One careful owner -
my dentist.

(Footsteps again)

05:01.820 --> 05:05.335
Can't be.
You watched me unlock the door.

State of him! lf you weren't a mate,
we'd put it round, ''gutless wimp''.

- Said the gobbets at the back!
- With biceps and up front, skid marks!

05:49.820 --> 05:53.859
You OK, Debs? You're not, are you?

05:56.100 --> 05:59.410
- l went past Katy Mason's party.
- Who's Katy Mason?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.019
Just outside,

06:02.100 --> 06:04.534
walking past.

06:04.620 --> 06:07.532
And her dad, he...

06:10.700 --> 06:12.930
- Her dad did what?
- Nothing.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.616
Debbie...

06:19.860 --> 06:21.896
Just take your time, all right?

06:27.020 --> 06:31.059
He was just laughing with them,
and playing with them.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.416
l couldn't see their faces.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.650
lt's not fair!

06:37.740 --> 06:39.696
Hey, hey! What wasn't fair?

06:40.860 --> 06:42.418
Everything.

06:43.940 --> 06:47.569
- So, l nicked something.
- You...?

06:47.660 --> 06:50.299
(Laughter)

06:50.380 --> 06:52.291
From the party?

06:52.380 --> 06:54.940
Jesus, Debbie!

06:55.020 --> 06:58.171
- Me heart nearly stopped then!
- Debs, we've all done it.

06:58.260 --> 07:00.979
Well done for owning up,
but don't try it again.

07:01.060 --> 07:04.132
Especially if confessions
are your strong point!

07:06.340 --> 07:10.174
- You cheeky monkey!
- (Baby chattering upstairs)

07:13.900 --> 07:15.856
(Liam) Who's that, Debbie?

07:31.820 --> 07:33.458
(Giggling)

07:59.940 --> 08:01.896
(Police siren)

08:02.940 --> 08:04.896
Oh, here we go!

08:08.580 --> 08:11.970
Send in the clowns! What have we done?

08:12.060 --> 08:13.857
Hey, what's anybody done?

08:16.260 --> 08:19.013
Don't pick on people round here.

08:20.820 --> 08:25.052
Tony Blair! You want a set to,
go and nail that twat!

08:27.620 --> 08:30.498
Who's the parents?
Move back! Who are the parents?

08:30.580 --> 08:34.368
- Here they are.
- Now, listen to me. No, listen to me.

08:34.460 --> 08:38.009
The faster we get information...
Come on, what are your names?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.169
- Jackie and Stewart.
- Jackie, Stewart,

08:40.260 --> 08:43.730
the faster we get information,
the faster we know what to do.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.812
There's a team on the way
and we need precise details.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.653
- When did you last see Jody?
- Half twelve.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.571
- Age?
- Three next week.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.173
He was a really good angel.

09:04.780 --> 09:08.659
Kiddie. Up the street. Snatched!

09:09.740 --> 09:11.696
Thin air!

09:11.780 --> 09:13.736
Oh, God help us...

09:18.660 --> 09:20.616
(Giggles)

09:20.980 --> 09:23.653
l'll show you who's best man.

09:25.380 --> 09:27.575
- Hey, Lip, is it true?
- What?

09:27.660 --> 09:30.777
- Unlucky in white, if you're lying.
- What?

09:31.820 --> 09:34.050
''My big day, Robert.''

09:34.140 --> 09:38.656
She only married him cos he paid off
his mortgage out of Disability.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.935
Oof!

09:42.020 --> 09:44.215
- What's your name?
- Jody.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.255
Jody.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.615
'She was outside the gate.'

09:47.700 --> 09:49.577
No-one was watching.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.810
Did she walk up
and you just spotted her?

09:51.900 --> 09:55.688
And you are happy that we found you

09:55.780 --> 09:58.248
when you were looking
for your mam on the street?

09:58.340 --> 10:01.571
You'd no idea where she belongs,
so you brought her here.

10:01.660 --> 10:03.412
So that we could help you.

10:03.500 --> 10:06.014
No. She had a party badge on.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.660
- Why'd you take her?
- She was crying for her mum.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.651
Where was her mum? Nobody cared!

10:10.740 --> 10:15.450
They will now! For fuck's sake, this is all
we need. Are you right in the head?

10:15.540 --> 10:18.452
- Grr!
- Fiona, calm down, all right?

10:18.540 --> 10:20.496
Kids get lost all the time.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.696
We take it back and we say...

10:22.780 --> 10:26.329
(Fiona) We're going to take you home,
aren't we, Jody?

10:26.420 --> 10:27.375
Yeah.

10:34.060 --> 10:36.574
- Hi. What's going on?
- lt's OK, Andrea.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.654
Me and lan, we're just having a laugh.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.891
Aren't prostitutes shy?

10:43.980 --> 10:47.336
- Still doing insurance claims, Lip?
- What are you after?

10:47.420 --> 10:51.493
l'm thinking, high winds, March 18th.
Aerial goes through the roof.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.616
Look, for Christ's sake!

10:53.700 --> 10:58.854
..to two floors down. That's two ceilings,
three carpets, and a NlCAM telly.

10:58.940 --> 11:02.933
Do you know what an aerial weighs?
Let's say the chimney went.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.772
How much do you charge?

11:04.860 --> 11:08.933
Ten for the forms, 20 when the claim's
paid, plus labour for pretend rubble,

11:09.020 --> 11:10.851
cos you don't have a chimney.

11:10.940 --> 11:14.853
(Megaphone) 'Ladies and gentlemen,
please can l have your attention?

11:14.940 --> 11:19.650
'l know emotions are running high.
l appreciate you really want to help...'

11:19.740 --> 11:24.018
How many times does this have
to happen before anybody listens?

11:25.180 --> 11:27.740
Eh? Hey, count the troops!

11:27.820 --> 11:33.497
Count the troops! lf we lived in Chorlton
they'd be all over like fucking crabs.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.696
A kiddie missing, one van, one car!

11:35.780 --> 11:38.977
Six monkeys! You know, makes you sick!

11:40.540 --> 11:43.373
Not the pigs themselves,
you know, thingies...

11:43.460 --> 11:50.059
Policies! The Home Office.
Probably Tony Blair! Again! l say...

11:50.140 --> 11:52.096
Look at everybody.

11:52.180 --> 11:56.537
We haven't got a clue about this.
We found her walking, all right?

11:56.620 --> 12:00.010
- l feel sick.
- You get her out, l'll do the talking.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.056
Oh, Fiona, Steve.

12:02.140 --> 12:05.052
Kiddie, this size. Jody. Little Jody.

12:05.140 --> 12:08.894
- You haven't passed a kiddie?
- Somebody wandered off, Frank?

12:08.980 --> 12:13.576
No! Frank spotted a junkie
looking over the fence at the party.

12:13.660 --> 12:16.333
About ten seconds before
little Jody disappears!

12:16.420 --> 12:19.378
Junkie with dreads.
Ugly bastards. Scummy.

12:19.460 --> 12:22.497
What the fuck are we doing,
standing here? Get him!

12:22.580 --> 12:24.969
Go on, get after him!

12:25.060 --> 12:29.338
- Jody!
- Where do Jody's parents live, Sheila?

12:29.420 --> 12:33.208
Wennon Street. But l think
they're still up there with the police.

12:33.300 --> 12:37.054
The kid was gonna be three
next week. He's not even three, Steve.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.813
We'll get on the street and... He?

12:39.900 --> 12:45.418
l know, it's bad enough if it's a girl, innit?
But your only son!

12:45.500 --> 12:48.856
- l mean, can you imagine?
- We'll hit the road to have a look.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.339
Aye, good lad.

12:50.420 --> 12:53.059
lt's a boy! Great! Get him down!

12:53.140 --> 12:55.096
God be with you.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.929
l know she's not a virgin,
cos l were there when she lost it.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.136
Bouncer. Sean Creed.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.938
Plus...

13:17.420 --> 13:20.298
l were knobbing her
every Friday down school baths.

13:20.380 --> 13:22.610
You were?

13:22.700 --> 13:24.611
God, yeah.

13:25.660 --> 13:27.537
Towel room.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.894
We had to do it in the pump house.

13:31.980 --> 13:36.417
Took me years to work out why
the smell of bleach followed me round.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.809
Are we going up for a kip?

13:45.780 --> 13:47.452
Can't budge.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.736
Do you like me hair this colour?

13:54.540 --> 13:56.496
Suits you.

13:57.860 --> 13:59.816
Me neither. Oh...

14:07.580 --> 14:09.138
(Applause and cheering on TV)

14:12.620 --> 14:14.576
Oh, well played.

14:18.060 --> 14:23.134
- What's the score, Kash?
- Eh? 2-1 . l think.

14:23.220 --> 14:26.849
Give us some baccy
and a packet of razors as well, mate.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.737
How's the baby, then, Pete?

14:28.820 --> 14:33.848
Me and Claire have had 10 hours' kip in a
fortnight. l'm this close to losing my job.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.817
(Cash register beeps)

14:37.420 --> 14:40.810
How was it between you and Yvonne?
You know, sex and that?

14:42.500 --> 14:45.094
- Pretty ordinary.
- No, after the first.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.654
Oh, right, yeah...

14:48.740 --> 14:50.696
About a fortnight.

14:50.780 --> 14:56.298
Fuck all in two months, me. She won't let
me near her. l'm pulling myself stupid.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.019
Yeah, l can imagine.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.739
You can see why l'm skint as well,
can't you?

15:01.820 --> 15:05.449
lf that cat walks past me
one more time with its tail in the air,

15:05.540 --> 15:09.328
it's getting one up the ring,
cos l am ten wanks beyond fussy.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.376
Cheers, mate.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.129
- Eh, good luck!
- l'm gonna need it.

15:17.860 --> 15:19.976
There he is!

15:20.060 --> 15:22.016
Where's the kid?

15:22.100 --> 15:23.852
The kid!

15:23.940 --> 15:25.896
The baby's at home.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.938
Oi! Get off him!

15:30.020 --> 15:32.329
Animals!

15:32.420 --> 15:33.978
Come on, let's search his flat.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.016
Come on, let's go!

15:37.700 --> 15:41.136
- What's all that about?
- Fuck knows.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.378
(Doorbell ringing)

15:45.460 --> 15:47.451
Kev! Door!

15:48.140 --> 15:50.096
(Knocking, doorbell)

15:50.180 --> 15:52.136
Kev!

15:54.500 --> 15:58.698
- Oh...
- l'm desperate. 15 minutes, l promise.

15:58.780 --> 16:00.498
Yeah, all right.

16:00.580 --> 16:03.492
No biscuits, Liam,
but if you help me rinse this lot off

16:03.580 --> 16:05.935
we can nip to the shop later. Come on!

16:11.900 --> 16:13.970
- (Door slams)
- (Fiona) Where is she?

16:15.340 --> 16:17.251
Debbie!

16:17.340 --> 16:19.296
Debbie...

16:19.380 --> 16:21.336
(Toilet flushing)

16:23.780 --> 16:25.736
Debbie, get out here!

16:30.860 --> 16:34.091
- Where's his clothes?
- They were covered in chocolate.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.180
(Washing machine spinning)

16:49.660 --> 16:52.049
She stuck it on a boil wash.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.459
Can you pass us a towel, love?

16:58.540 --> 17:00.496
Right. What time is it?

17:01.860 --> 17:04.010
Kev's back at work at six.

17:04.099 --> 17:06.056
- We'll get started...
- Why?

17:09.619 --> 17:13.214
Who the fuck are you?

17:16.579 --> 17:18.616
Kev, don't!

17:22.579 --> 17:24.536
Age 3-5.

17:24.619 --> 17:27.214
You having a laugh? That looks massive.

17:28.820 --> 17:32.096
Heya. What are you looking at?
ls that for your birthday?

17:32.180 --> 17:33.977
- No.
- When is your birthday?

17:34.060 --> 17:36.016
l'm nearly four.

17:37.580 --> 17:40.572
Yeah. Come on, get in.
Happy birthday, mate.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.850
(Siren)

17:43.940 --> 17:46.773
We are now looking for
a three-year-old lost boy,

17:46.860 --> 17:48.851
with strawberry-blond hair.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.659
- Got the wig off Suzy.
- Who's Suzy?

17:51.740 --> 17:54.300
Dressing Suzy. My hairdressing kit.

17:54.380 --> 17:58.009
Blue leggings, red trunks,
trainers, and a Captain Curtis T-shirt.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.091
- And the dress?
- World Children shop.

18:01.020 --> 18:03.853
- Answering to the name of...
- Jody!

18:03.940 --> 18:07.489
Was Jody inside or outside the gates
when you grabbed her?

18:07.580 --> 18:10.094
- l didn't grab her.
- And it's not her!

18:10.180 --> 18:13.138
l know. lnside.

18:13.220 --> 18:16.974
Please contact us immediately.
We need your help looking for a lost...

18:17.060 --> 18:19.858
- How did you get him?
- l waved some chocolate buttons.

18:19.940 --> 18:23.137
- Who saw you?
- Nobody! We just ran.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.973
Legging it down the street with a baby?

18:26.060 --> 18:27.778
ln a pram.

18:27.860 --> 18:30.579
- What pram?
- Liam's old one.

18:30.660 --> 18:33.970
- l chucked it out.
- l fixed it. For emergencies.

18:34.060 --> 18:38.099
- (Steve) What kind of emergencies?
- l don't know.

18:38.180 --> 18:40.933
- What did you stick him in a dress for?
- l wanted a girl,

18:41.020 --> 18:43.295
but none of the girls wanted a chocolate.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.894
(Knocking on door)

18:47.620 --> 18:50.088
Fiona! Fiona!

18:53.180 --> 18:56.775
Who the hell's this? We're not
bloody childminders, you know!

18:59.140 --> 19:02.212
lt's still damp,
and it still looks brand new to me.

19:02.300 --> 19:05.178
What did l say to you last week?

19:05.260 --> 19:10.698
She put all our forks in the knife drawer.
She's off her fucking cake sometimes.

19:10.780 --> 19:14.170
- Who's screwy for letting her?
- Debbie planned this.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.137
- And thanks, friend!
- Me?

19:16.220 --> 19:19.451
l've had that kid in our house.
l'm involved now!

19:19.540 --> 19:22.213
(Steve) Debbie's a kid herself,
with a problem.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.689
The worst that can happen
is she gets help.

19:24.780 --> 19:26.498
What kind of help?

19:26.580 --> 19:30.095
She nabbed a kid, right?
lf we leave it, it'll get much worse.

19:30.180 --> 19:34.139
- You mean grass her up?
- Lip, you said it was premeditated.

19:34.220 --> 19:37.735
Whoa, posh lad! l don't know what
help means where you come from,

19:37.820 --> 19:41.369
but they'll shred Debbie.
Screwy or not, they don't take prisoners.

19:41.460 --> 19:45.851
She's not screwy, and she didn't steal.
She borrowed him accidentally.

19:45.940 --> 19:49.694
Not if she used fucking chocolate
to get him in a pram, Veronica.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.850
They'll torch our house!

19:51.940 --> 19:54.613
(Megaphone) 'We are looking for
a young boy...

19:54.700 --> 19:57.134
- 'wearing blue trainers...'
- No!

19:57.220 --> 19:59.495
'..and a Captain Curtis T-shirt.'

19:59.580 --> 20:02.333
lf Social Services find out
Dad moved in with Sheila,

20:02.420 --> 20:04.729
they'll have a field day splitting us up.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.095
'You know what happened last time!'

20:10.580 --> 20:12.172
No!

20:12.260 --> 20:14.979
Next suggestion on
a much bigger fucking postcard!

20:16.460 --> 20:20.658
Jo-o-o-o-dyyyy!

20:29.260 --> 20:32.650
(Door opens and slams shut)

20:32.740 --> 20:35.971
- l can't eat, Sheila.
- Well, you should try, sweetheart.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.016
Eh?

20:42.940 --> 20:48.936
lf that kid was one of mine, l'd want that
guy's bollocks in a bag. No two ways!

20:49.020 --> 20:51.295
So we're too lenient with sex offenders?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.416
Say what you like about Saddam,

20:53.500 --> 20:56.651
he'd have had that twisted bastard
melted down.

20:56.740 --> 21:01.939
Tell Tony Blair. That's how you'll get my
vote. Pasty-faced gimp! Write that down!

21:02.020 --> 21:06.650
Hey! She does Cherie Blair.
Do Cherie Blair for us. Do it for us, go on.

21:08.060 --> 21:12.736
(Screeching) l'm just
a normal wife and mother.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.334
She does it better than that, usually.

21:15.420 --> 21:20.414
- (Reporter) Frank, you're a father of six.
- Well, you'd die for your kids.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.253
They so much as get a temperature,
you're there!

21:23.340 --> 21:25.900
lt's eight o'clock. Take me! Give it to me!

21:25.980 --> 21:29.336
So you drum it in to your children
to avoid strangers?

21:29.420 --> 21:32.856
Spot a nonce, deck him first,
go for the eyes, cripple the fuck.

21:32.940 --> 21:34.771
Then fine, and addle.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.657
Will they listen?

21:38.900 --> 21:42.859
- l'll try and nip back later, Frank.
- Hey... (lndistinct)

21:44.220 --> 21:47.132
- What's all that about?
- You missed it all.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.893
lt's awful. Abduction.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.936
Little Jody.

21:59.580 --> 22:03.209
Jo-o-o-dyyyy!

22:07.060 --> 22:11.053
(lmitates Gollum) They've come
to take our precious...

22:11.900 --> 22:15.575
No, the precious is ours for all eternity.

22:16.620 --> 22:20.408
lt's a girly precious,
not a boysy precious.

22:20.500 --> 22:24.334
How can that be, if he's got a penis?

22:24.420 --> 22:27.457
- Oh, no....
- Pack it in, you.

22:27.540 --> 22:31.294
- Don't need you, Carl.
- (Sniggers)

22:31.380 --> 22:33.848
- l only wanted to cheer him up.
- Who wouldn't?

22:33.940 --> 22:37.012
- He needed looking after.
- Yeah, we know that.

22:37.100 --> 22:41.173
But if it's a bloke or a boy taking Jody
home, people think something bad.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.251
Not if you took him.

22:43.340 --> 22:47.618
We can't, cos we've already been
round there saying we know nothing.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.134
We'd sound like we were telling lies!

22:50.220 --> 22:53.098
- You were.
- Yeah, for you!

22:53.180 --> 22:56.172
- Look, it's been three hours since...
- Three and a half!

22:56.260 --> 23:00.936
That's a long time, Debbie. An adult
would have phoned somebody by now.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.096
Well, what would l have to say?

23:12.340 --> 23:16.379
Get on your bike. Corner of Beaker Street
and David's Lane, the phone box.

23:16.460 --> 23:19.497
Ring the police and say this. Exactly this.

23:19.580 --> 23:22.253
- 20 past four. Exactly 20 past four.
- Why should l?

23:22.340 --> 23:24.456
Do you want to go into
a children's home?

23:24.540 --> 23:27.771
The one on Crofton's got
a full-size trampoline.

23:27.860 --> 23:30.374
Just do it!

23:30.460 --> 23:33.179
- l don't own a bike.
- So go and nick one.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.096
Shit!

23:49.700 --> 23:52.453
- (Ringing tone)
- 'Emergency services.'

23:52.540 --> 23:55.259
'l was walking up Beaker Street...'

23:55.340 --> 23:58.218
- Coming from the...?
- Swimming baths.

23:58.300 --> 24:00.052
When l saw Jody.

24:00.140 --> 24:03.257
- You didn't know his name then.
- A little boy.

24:05.220 --> 24:07.973
- On his own.
- On his own.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.291
- Crying. l asked where her mum was.
- Not her.

24:11.380 --> 24:14.178
l asked him where his mum was,

24:14.260 --> 24:17.491
- and he didn't know.
- Good girl, that's great, Debs.

24:17.580 --> 24:20.936
l looked round. l couldn't see any adults.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.976
He was upset.

24:23.060 --> 24:27.133
So l gave him some chocolate,
which he liked.

24:27.220 --> 24:28.255
Good!

24:28.340 --> 24:32.538
You turned left, out of David's Lane,
heading for the park.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.771
- Past Beaker Street, into David's Lane.
- 'When was this?'

24:35.860 --> 24:38.294
''10 minutes, back when l saw him.''

24:39.540 --> 24:42.850
''10 minutes back.
When l saw him, l thought,

24:42.940 --> 24:46.774
- ''lsn't that the kid they're looking for?''
- 'Definitely Captain Curtis?'

24:46.860 --> 24:50.694
l didn't say Captain Curtis,
l said...cape...

24:50.780 --> 24:52.577
- 'Sorry, go on.'
- He was with a girl.

24:52.660 --> 24:54.173
- 'Can you describe her?'

24:54.260 --> 24:57.969
Then you went to a phone box
at Bristol Grove.

24:58.060 --> 25:02.690
l went to a phone box on Bristol Grove.
l thought, ''l'd best phone the police.''

25:02.780 --> 25:05.658
Or somebody. That one was vandalised.

25:08.380 --> 25:11.452
There's a phone box
at Beaker Street and David's Lane.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.496
Why didn't you use that one, Debbie?

25:13.580 --> 25:16.219
- Cos there was someone using it.
- An adult?

25:16.300 --> 25:18.052
- Yeah.
- You didn't tell the adult

25:18.140 --> 25:20.256
that you found a child?

25:20.340 --> 25:23.412
He was using the phone box as a toilet,
so l didn't trust him.

25:23.500 --> 25:26.378
- 'So we ran.'
- 'Good.'

25:26.460 --> 25:29.099
So l decided to walk
towards home and tell youse.

25:29.180 --> 25:32.013
- So we crossed Benson Road...
- At the crossing.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.330
Crossed Benson Road at the pelican,

25:34.420 --> 25:36.888
and Jody caught his cloak
on a bit of fencing,

25:36.980 --> 25:39.130
and it ripped.

25:39.220 --> 25:42.292
- Eh, wow! What do you look like now?
- A girl!

25:42.380 --> 25:44.530
- No, you don't.
- Lipstick.

25:44.620 --> 25:45.939
Not lipstick.

25:46.020 --> 25:48.295
- Where's your socks?
- (Giggles)

25:48.380 --> 25:49.335
Socks!

25:50.300 --> 25:55.499
Fiona will switch the kids. lf anybody
asks, she's been shopping, all right?

25:55.580 --> 25:59.653
We're getting off. l'll see you round
Sheila's in half an hour, all right?

25:59.740 --> 26:02.493
Lip, can you stick the kids
in the car, please?

26:02.580 --> 26:04.889
- Come on, you two, quick!
- l'm coming.

26:04.980 --> 26:07.050
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

26:07.140 --> 26:11.452
- What will they do to her if they find her?
- Don't even think about this.

26:11.540 --> 26:15.818
- She's fine. She's doing great.
- She can't tell lies. She never could.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.460
- She's not even sorry!
- Yeah, l know.

26:19.740 --> 26:22.413
lf this all goes pear-shaped
with the authorities,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.252
should l say l'm living here?

26:24.340 --> 26:27.332
- Why?
- Less risk of the kids getting split up

26:27.420 --> 26:29.411
if they know two wages are coming in.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.570
Yeah.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.616
All right? Come here.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.416
Good luck. All right?

26:40.140 --> 26:43.132
- Bravo Echo, come in.
- 'Receiving, over.'

26:43.220 --> 26:46.610
Unconfirmed sighting, junction
Beaker Street and David's Lane.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.578
Captain Curtis, question mark,
could be Jody.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.094
Accompanied by
a young girl, question mark.

26:52.180 --> 26:56.059
Young girl with handbag, question mark.
Could be girl or small female.

26:56.140 --> 27:00.292
- Proceed to target immediately.
- 'On our way. Over.'

27:05.060 --> 27:06.971
Now.

27:07.060 --> 27:11.099
Come on. Now. Come on, Liam,
go with Debbie. Here, look, chocolate.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.375
Come on. Go with Debbie. Good boy.

27:15.380 --> 27:18.338
- Debbie, do you trust Fiona?
- Yeah.

27:18.420 --> 27:22.891
Do you think she trusts you? l don't
think so. She thinks you're a crap liar.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.414
- But do you know what l think, Debs?
- No.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.094
You could be a brilliant liar
if you wanted to be.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.410
You could be a much better liar.

27:30.500 --> 27:33.572
You know lawyers, doctors and nurses
and all that lot?

27:33.660 --> 27:34.649
(Debbie) Yeah.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.130
Professional liars. They tell lies
to make people's lives better.

27:38.220 --> 27:41.735
Your doctor wouldn't say, ''Tough,
you're dying of cancer,'' would he?

27:41.820 --> 27:42.775
No.

27:42.860 --> 27:45.055
He'd say, ''We're doing all we can.''

27:45.140 --> 27:48.894
- Yeah.
- So, what if today you were a doctor,

27:48.980 --> 27:51.892
telling a doctor's kind of lie,
would you blush?

27:53.060 --> 27:55.210
- No.
- Right. You're a doctor.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.211
Can l be a nurse?

27:57.300 --> 27:59.131
(Steve) Yeah.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.098
Right, be brilliant. Yeah, Debs?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.011
(Jody) l'll be the doctor.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.056
Get my jacket. Come on.

28:06.140 --> 28:08.210
Good luck.

28:08.300 --> 28:11.372
Be a good doctor, yeah?
And l'll be a good nurse.

28:19.580 --> 28:22.014
- Jody!
- Jody!

28:31.100 --> 28:33.056
(ln distance) Jody!

28:35.740 --> 28:37.696
- Boo!
- Boo.

28:39.980 --> 28:41.936
Upsadaisy.

28:45.980 --> 28:50.098
Get in, Liam. ln the pram!
Where are you going?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.933

29:24.780 --> 29:27.772
lt's been a while
since l've seen one of them.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.256

Kid in a Captain Curtis costume.

29:42.020 --> 29:43.976
Child! Blond!

29:50.180 --> 29:52.819
None of you?

29:52.900 --> 29:54.936
- Forget it!
- What did you say, Kev?

29:55.020 --> 29:56.976
- Forget it.
- Captain Curtis, go on.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.369

29:59.460 --> 30:02.099
l haven't seen
a Captain Curtis costume in years,

30:02.180 --> 30:06.810
and l used to have one. l just passed
a kid in one and it reminded me of me.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.095
- Have you told anybody?
- Yeah.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.375
These deaf old twats aren't interested.

30:11.460 --> 30:14.532
Because that's what they are.
Where did you see him?

30:14.620 --> 30:17.612
l just passed him on Benson Road.

30:17.700 --> 30:20.612
That's little Jody.
He vanished this afternoon.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.577
They've been searching for him.

30:22.660 --> 30:25.128
Which l heard nothing about.
l was at a wedding.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.451
- Kev, blond, about three?
- Blond, about three.

30:29.740 --> 30:32.413
- With a junkie?
- No, no, with a young...

30:36.780 --> 30:40.250
l wouldn't say ''a young girl''
if it was Debbie from next door.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.012
What if she was wearing a hat?

30:42.100 --> 30:43.772
- ls she?
- 'No.'

30:55.020 --> 30:57.488

so Kev wouldn't recognise her.'

30:57.580 --> 31:00.174
- But she isn't.
- 'We know that.'

31:00.260 --> 31:01.773

- 'What have you got?'

31:01.860 --> 31:04.772
- But she's in position.
- 'Oh, Jesus...'

31:04.860 --> 31:07.613

Black baseball cap.

That's Benson Road?

31:42.940 --> 31:44.896
Heading in which direction?

31:47.820 --> 31:49.776
They've not found him?

31:49.860 --> 31:52.852

are going through.

Would you like a drink, Fiona?

Oh, uh... A cup of tea
