00:12.200 --> 00:17.720
[pastor in Swedish] Immediately
after the tribulation of those days,

00:17.800 --> 00:20.760
the sun will be darkened,

00:20.840 --> 00:23.800
and the moon will not give its light,

00:23.880 --> 00:29.000
and the powers of the heavens
will be shaken.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.840
Then...

00:31.640 --> 00:36.800
...will appear the sign of my arrival,
which will be seen in heaven.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.040
Time has come, my friends.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.400
[all]
Hallelujah.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.360
Three.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.800
Two.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.600
One.

00:47.680 --> 00:48.960
Zero.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.760
[bird cawing]

01:00.880 --> 01:02.800
I don't understand this.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.320
Do you have the same time as me?

01:08.400 --> 01:13.120
Check on Twitter and Facebook,
see if anything's happened.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.760
- Nothing.
- [pastor] No earthquakes?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.520
Flooding?

01:19.600 --> 01:23.320
Volcanic eruptions?
I can't have miscalculated!

01:23.400 --> 01:25.560
[sobbing] Not this time.
I was so sure.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.720
Judgment day is here.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.120
Come and get me, my Lord!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.520
He's losing it.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.040
I know.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.360
Maybe it's about time
to go home to Norway?

01:40.440 --> 01:42.440
My God.

01:42.520 --> 01:46.280
My God.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.960
[theme music playing]

02:22.160 --> 02:24.600
[in English]
Don't forget to water down the booze.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.760
Them hillbillies from FÃ¥berg
are so full of moonshine,

02:27.880 --> 02:29.800
- they can't tell the difference.
- Got it, boss.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.520
And raise the temperature.
Sweaty broads, thirsty guys,

02:32.600 --> 02:34.240
that's the key to our success.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.080
- Capisce?
- Capisce.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.800
[in Norwegian]
What's going on in Oslo?

02:37.880 --> 02:39.960
[in English]
Ah, it's a personal matter.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.400
You sure you're ready for this?

02:41.480 --> 02:44.600
[yawning]
I was born ready, sir.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.520
Really?

02:46.600 --> 02:49.200
I was up all night
watching a moon eclipse.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.080
Fascinating stuff.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.080
A lunar eclipse?

02:53.160 --> 02:55.160
Now you're really starting to worry me.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.840
[in Norwegian]
Relax, Johnny. I'm here too.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.320
Ready to step in if my brother
is not on top of his game.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.840
That gives me
enormous comfort, my friend.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.920
[black metal music playing loudly]

03:17.000 --> 03:18.120
Hey.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.120
Uh, do you mind?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.200
- [in Norwegian] Sorry.
- [music stops]

03:24.280 --> 03:28.040
I always wind down with some music
when there's stress at work.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.480
Venom, Hellhammer, Mayhem.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.000
[in English] Sounds more like dogshit,
horseshit and mooseshit to me.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.920
[in Norwegian]
No reason to be a smart-ass.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.600
We are on the same side,
you know.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.880
[in English]
Yeah, about that. Uh...

03:41.960 --> 03:44.680
There's something about this
that doesn't quite add up to me.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.080
[in Norwegian]
All right?

03:47.160 --> 03:50.520
[in English] The, uh, files that got lost,
they were, uh, found

03:50.600 --> 03:52.800
- in a regular safety deposit box?
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.520
Don't you have, like, a secret
vault or some shit like that?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.760
[in Norwegian]
The bank box didn't belong to the PST.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.640
It was more of a private arrangement.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.480
Let's say it's my pension fund.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.400
[in English] So you stole my file
from your own people.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.000
[in Norwegian] You know information
about others is valuable stuff.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.960
And who exactly is this guy
we're going to meet?

04:17.040 --> 04:21.440
[Johnny in English] Let's just say he's
in a perfect place at the perfect time.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.280
[in Norwegian]
Really hungry, you.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.440
I was gonna pay, there was
just so much chaos in there.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.320
Too bad you forgot,
now you'll have to come with me.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.520
[woman over radio]
Reception.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.240
[Mette] Hello, could you please put me
through to Human Resources at the PST?

04:39.320 --> 04:42.080
- One moment.
- Hi, Sturle.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.880
- [Sturle]  Hi.
- [Mette] Hi.

04:43.960 --> 04:48.600
That guy we used to call The Bat,
is he still with the Service?

04:48.680 --> 04:51.600
Yes. I believe he works in the archives.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.800
Okay.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.640
[grunts]

04:58.720 --> 05:01.680
Okay, thank you, Sturle.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.920
[in English] Yes.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.440
[sighs]

05:13.520 --> 05:15.880
[in Norwegian]
So this is where your buddy lives.

05:15.960 --> 05:20.240
[in English] Ah, it's more
like a temporary residence.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.120
[guard in Norwegian]
I'll take your jacket.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.640
- [machine beeps]
- You seem to have beeped.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.560
[wand beeping]

05:35.640 --> 05:36.920
Okay.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.200
[beeping]

05:38.280 --> 05:39.960
I have a piercing down there.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.600
That's something I'll have to check,
unfortunately.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.560
[Aadne clears throat]

05:48.640 --> 05:50.560
[belt jingles]

05:55.240 --> 05:56.640
I was young.

05:56.720 --> 06:00.120
We had different ideas
about style in my crowd.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.360
Sure. It looks all right.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.600
[door closes]

06:25.680 --> 06:28.360
- Hello there!
- [chuckles]

06:28.440 --> 06:31.400
Have to admit I was a little
puzzled to hear you were coming.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.080
[in English]
What's the matter?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.720
A guy can't come say hello
to a pal away at college?

06:35.800 --> 06:37.760
[chuckles]

06:37.840 --> 06:41.840
Somehow I doubt this is a social call.
What's up?

06:41.920 --> 06:43.200
I need a favor.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.440
[in Norwegian] Do you remember
how I ended up in here?

06:47.520 --> 06:51.160
Kind of far out for you to show up here
and ask me for a favor.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.560
[in English] What I would recommend
for the remainder of this conversation...

06:58.040 --> 07:01.240
...is a little less focus on the past

07:01.320 --> 07:03.720
and little more on the future.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.760
My friend here,

07:05.840 --> 07:08.640
he's got people in high places.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.160
Get you out of here in a couple of days.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.840
Okay. What can I do for you?

07:21.520 --> 07:24.040
You heard about this Bieber Heist?

07:24.120 --> 07:25.720
Yeah.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.720
Amongst other things,

07:27.800 --> 07:30.480
these individuals purloined

07:30.560 --> 07:34.320
certain objects of value
to me and my friend here.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.520
Well, we would endeavor to have
a conversation

07:36.600 --> 07:39.800
with these same individuals,
if at all possible.

07:39.880 --> 07:44.000
Well, I don't know
who the robbers are...

07:44.080 --> 07:47.120
[in Norwegian] ...but I know someone
who might be able to help.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.720
You heard about "The Orange"?

07:50.800 --> 07:54.160
He's like the banker for robbers.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.400
[in English]
Orange?

07:57.320 --> 07:58.800
Is he from Miami?

07:58.880 --> 08:01.440
[chuckles]

08:01.520 --> 08:03.760
[in English]
No. Not quite.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.640
[in Norwegian] He takes B12 injections
to get a tan. Fucking vain guy.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.360
[in English]
Okay. How do we find this fruit?

08:12.440 --> 08:16.800
[in Norwegian] I'll let you know as soon
as my new date of release is confirmed.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.720
[in English]
Okay?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.600
[Torgeir in Norwegian] You're supposed
to pay the staff price for that beer.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.080
Oh, relax.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.760
You'll have to accept a little shrinkage.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.120
Are you leaving?

08:33.200 --> 08:35.320
Yeah, I have to stop by the asylum center.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.240
Why?

08:37.320 --> 08:38.920
Well...

08:39.000 --> 08:41.120
You're always hanging out
with those asylum people.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.560
Why don't you stay here.
Party with the guys?

08:43.640 --> 08:46.760
Sounds nice,
but I really have to go.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.120
It's kind of a special occasion tonight.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.960
- And what's so special?
- Well,

08:51.040 --> 08:54.720
I think they might've
organized something up there

08:54.800 --> 08:56.880
since it's my birthday.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.840
It's your birthday?
Why haven't you said anything?

08:58.920 --> 09:00.320
It's your birthday today?

09:00.400 --> 09:02.160
- [Roar] Shit! Congratulations.
- [Torgeir] Congratulations.

09:02.240 --> 09:05.240
- Thanks, thanks.
- [whistles] Cindy!

09:05.320 --> 09:07.600
- It is Jan's turn.
- No, no.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.400
- [Roar] It is.
- Stop it.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.320
[men laugh]

09:13.840 --> 09:16.000
Come on.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.640
Put on some music!

09:17.720 --> 09:19.880
[Stagedolls'
"Love Don't Bother Me" playing]

09:19.960 --> 09:22.640
[Jan]
You guys!

09:22.720 --> 09:25.200
Maybe I'll stay a bit longer after all.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.480
[cheering]

09:31.560 --> 09:33.120
[both laughing]

09:35.440 --> 09:37.960
Is it allowed for me
to lick those breasts?

09:41.520 --> 09:43.280
[laughing]

09:44.920 --> 09:46.120
Hello!

09:48.040 --> 09:50.720
Randi. I was just on my way up
to the asylum center.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.840
Looks like you took a little detour?

09:54.400 --> 09:57.640
Oh, that? Just an innocent
boys' game on my birthday.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.520
Stop it. I heard what you said
to that poor girl.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.400
Oh, but that's just our tone

10:04.480 --> 10:07.480
here at the Flamingo,
a kind of tribal language.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.680
Tribal language? Fuck that.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.280
You--
Wait, Randi, I'm coming.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.680
No! You can just forget it.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.680
Am I supposed to say no, then,
when the boys are throwing a party?

10:19.760 --> 10:21.320
Yes.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.360
When you're involved with one woman,
you're not supposed to lick other women.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.200
I didn't know we had such strict rules!

10:32.000 --> 10:33.480
[laughs]

10:35.200 --> 10:39.000
[all singing "Happy Birthday" in English]

10:42.200 --> 10:44.600
[in Norwegian]
He isn't coming. Sit down!

10:44.680 --> 10:46.360
I need some of your herb.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.360
- What's up? I thought you quit.
- You were wrong.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.840
But I have promised Jan not to--

10:50.920 --> 10:53.080
Give me some right away,

10:53.160 --> 10:54.800
or I'll kick that black ass of yours

10:54.880 --> 10:57.240
so fucking far out of this country that...

10:57.320 --> 11:00.360
[piano playing "Happy Birthday"]

11:00.440 --> 11:03.480
Okay, okay.
One hundred percent.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.400
[piano keys thunk]

11:11.000 --> 11:12.320
[door slams]

11:40.240 --> 11:41.960
[in English]
That's gotta be our guy.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.480
Give me your badge.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.080
Huh?

11:47.160 --> 11:48.920
Give me your badge.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.760
Psst.

11:59.960 --> 12:05.120
[in Norwegian] I have a customer now.
You have to order at the desk.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.200
[in English]
Get lost, honey. And don't come back.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.720
[gasps]

12:23.800 --> 12:25.960
[Johnny]
Now, this is how it's gonna go.

12:26.040 --> 12:30.040
I'm gonna ask you a question.
You answer good, no pain.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.680
You answer bad, pain.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.840
- Capisce?
- Let me go.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.880
- Who are you?
- [imitates buzzer] Wrong answer.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.720
[screams]

12:39.800 --> 12:41.840
Okay. Wait, wait.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.600
[Johnny]
Okay, now. Here's the question.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.400
How can we find the guys
who did the Bieber Heist?

12:47.480 --> 12:50.720
I'm just an innocent businessman. Please!

12:52.120 --> 12:53.880
- [rips]
- [screams]

12:53.960 --> 12:56.480
Okay, okay, okay.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.360
I have been laundering
some money for some people.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.600
But I don't know shit about this heist.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.360
I don't know nothing.

13:05.440 --> 13:09.480
Is it me, or are those nipples
looking kind of extra hairy?

13:10.440 --> 13:15.080
Please. Not there.
My nipples are very sensitive.

13:15.160 --> 13:15.960
Mm-hmm.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.840
[screams]

13:29.600 --> 13:31.080
[Torgeir snoring]

13:37.840 --> 13:39.520
[groans]

13:42.480 --> 13:44.160
[in Norwegian]
Momma?

13:44.240 --> 13:46.400
Momma?

13:46.480 --> 13:49.280
Shut up. You're sleep-talking
about Mom again.

13:49.360 --> 13:54.200
[Wenche] Aw, look at my boys.

13:56.760 --> 14:00.040
All grown up!

14:04.080 --> 14:06.920
What the fuck are you doing here?

14:07.000 --> 14:11.320
I stopped by at the farm.
The neighbor said I'd find you here.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.200
My meaning was,
what the fuck are you doing in Norway?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.800
Calm down. My God.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.640
- It is nice to see you.
- Yes, yes.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.960
I am sorry that I haven't gotten
around to visiting you sooner.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.120
- I apologize.
- Relax, Mom. You are here now.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.400
[Wenche]
My big, strong boy--

14:27.480 --> 14:31.400
Would've been even nicer if it didn't take
10 years between each visit.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.520
Do you like chai lattes?

14:48.040 --> 14:50.000
Who doesn't.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.280
Ready for the first day
of the rest of your life, my friend?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.600
[in English] You betcha.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.480
[in Norwegian] So when that cult stuff is
suddenly not so groovy anymore,

15:04.560 --> 15:07.280
we're supposed to be there
for her, is that it?

15:07.360 --> 15:11.160
Let loose, Torgeir.
Do like the rappers say.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.080
[in English]
"Chillax, motherfucker."

15:13.160 --> 15:15.240
[in Norwegian] Don't believe
those rappers ever met our mom.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.600
- [door opens]
- [Wenche laughing]

15:17.680 --> 15:20.640
Here's someone you have to meet.

15:20.720 --> 15:24.120
Stanley, the new rock in my life.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.040
[Stanley]
Hi.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.520
Shit. I didn't know
you were such big shots.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.360
Pow! Pow!

15:33.440 --> 15:35.360
[Stanley laughs]

15:35.440 --> 15:38.120
This is one hell of a nightclub
you've got!

15:38.200 --> 15:39.400
Yeah.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.360
- Yeah. We've got something going here.
- Sure, sure.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.040
Check out that one.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.520
[Stanley laughs]

15:45.600 --> 15:48.400
[in English]
"First lesson free."

15:48.480 --> 15:51.240
[in Norwegian]
This must be Roar.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.000
- That's correct.
- Hi. The funny one.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.880
[Roar]
Exactly.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.240
Belinda! Could we have
some champagne for our guests.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.600
Champagne?
Let's slow down a little.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.360
Stop it.

16:03.440 --> 16:06.800
- Take a cava, at least.
- [Wenche] They've never changed.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.680
Roar so generous

16:09.760 --> 16:12.280
and Torgeir more restrained.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.800
[Wench and Stanley laugh]

16:13.880 --> 16:16.640
Plus and... minus.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.920
- [Stanley laughs]
- [Wenche] Yeah.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.840
I bought you some stuff.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.400
I have apple juice, ecological of course.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.800
And the world's best  pata negra.

16:28.960 --> 16:34.080
This is better service than
in Norwegian prisons, I promise you.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.120
Can I take a shower?

16:37.200 --> 16:39.880
Yeah, sure.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.200
[in English]
Enjoying your freedom, Tommy boy?

16:50.280 --> 16:53.720
I wish we could leave our doors
open like that in Brooklyn.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.640
That orange you tried to sell us,

16:56.720 --> 16:59.040
turned out to be a lemon.

16:59.120 --> 17:03.400
[in Norwegian]
Johnny, don't be gangsterish about that.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.120
I made an honest attempt to help you.
Really. Cross my heart.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.040
[in English] Cross your heart
and hope to die, Tommy boy?

17:10.120 --> 17:11.600
Huh?

17:12.720 --> 17:14.760
[Zlatan in Norwegian] Who the fuck are you
to think you can come in here

17:14.840 --> 17:17.600
- and mess with my friend?
- [Thomas] Easy now, easy boys.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.560
[in English]
You muscle up on your first day out?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.760
[in Norwegian] Nobody has muscled up
anything. This is my New Path mentor.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.440
He's helping me get back on track.

17:25.520 --> 17:28.040
[in English] I'm sure Dirty Harry
will put you on the right path.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.800
[Thomas in Norwegian]
Listen, guys.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.200
In prison, we had these classes called
Coping with Conflict.

17:35.280 --> 17:37.920
When things got rough,
we sat down in a circle...

17:38.000 --> 17:39.680
[in English]
...and we had a cup of chamomile tea,

17:39.760 --> 17:42.800
and everyone just told
what they had on the heart.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.160
[in Norwegian] Sounds like a good idea.
Let's do that!

17:48.720 --> 17:50.240
[slurping]

17:54.160 --> 17:56.920
[in English] Okay, well.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.960
[in Norwegian] Here's the case.
These guys here, they sped up my release.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.800
In return, they expect some information.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.520
What kind of information
are we talking about?

18:09.600 --> 18:13.160
Who's behind the Bieber Heist.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.440
Why didn't you just say so?

18:15.520 --> 18:17.840
[in English]
I can find out those things.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.000
[in Norwegian]
I am straight now,

18:20.080 --> 18:23.880
but I did five years
for armed robbery before that.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.440
But...

18:26.520 --> 18:27.920
Problem is, I'm pretty lazy.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.880
I need strong incentives
to get my ass in gear.

18:30.960 --> 18:34.360
- If you understand my drift.
- [chuckles]

18:34.440 --> 18:36.400
[in English]
Yeah.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.240
Yeah, well, for the right information,

18:40.320 --> 18:42.880
we got a hundred thousand
incentives for you.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.720
[in Norwegian]
You'll hear from us.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.080
[band playing "Girl in Oslo"]

19:31.520 --> 19:35.480
[in Norwegian] Oh! God!
Can someone turn that heat down!

19:35.560 --> 19:38.480
Torry! Torry boy!

19:38.560 --> 19:39.920
Turn down the heat.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.600
[Torgeir]
Sorry, no. And my name is Torgeir.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.920
Listen, boy.
Your mother's almost got heat shock.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.640
It's like a fucking sauna in here.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.600
It's part of our business strategy
to keep it hot.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.360
A good son is considerate to his mom,

20:00.440 --> 20:02.880
especially when she's
going through menopause.

20:03.040 --> 20:07.320
The temperature stays as it is.
And this area's for personnel only.

20:07.400 --> 20:11.280
- Get the temperature down!
- What?

20:11.440 --> 20:13.440
I can't hear you.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.480
[muffled song continuing]

20:19.800 --> 20:21.760
[whistling]

20:21.840 --> 20:23.800
Oh.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.080
What are you doing?

20:25.920 --> 20:30.360
The money is flowing out,
so I had to get some from the safe.

20:30.440 --> 20:33.920
That's the management's safe.
Who gave you the code?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.160
I remember the day
you lost your virginity

20:37.240 --> 20:40.440
to that fat Finnish
ice-skating functionary.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.080
Put the money back, anyway.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.600
- Relax. I'm not using my own money.
- Put the money back!

20:45.680 --> 20:48.560
Hey, I'm not gonna cover expenses
for the club.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.560
Do you think a champagne fountain is free?
It cost ten grand.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.480
I haven't asked for a champagne fountain.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.480
But Mom said--

20:55.560 --> 20:58.840
Mom? So she's the CEO now?

20:58.920 --> 21:01.680
Relax. My God.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.160
When are you going to realize
she only cares about herself?

21:04.240 --> 21:09.360
- That is not true. You are talking piss.
- She is a cunt, an egotistical cunt.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.200
That--

21:11.280 --> 21:14.640
Torgeir, we don't talk like that
about Mom.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.920
Cunt.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.760
[both grunting]

21:34.480 --> 21:38.120
["Girl in Oslo" playing loudly]

21:42.160 --> 21:45.720
[Torgeir]
That's it!

21:45.800 --> 21:48.920
No, no!

21:49.680 --> 21:52.280
[all shouting]

21:57.240 --> 21:58.520
[music stops]

22:23.040 --> 22:24.440
[in English]
What the fuck?

22:29.280 --> 22:30.560
[door opens]

22:33.440 --> 22:34.600
What, are you living here now?

22:34.680 --> 22:37.120
Just been working some overtime.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.760
[Johnny]
Uh-huh.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.440
Oh, that kind of overtime.

22:41.520 --> 22:42.800
[laughs] Yeah.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.320
[Johnny]
Tell me, uh,

22:44.400 --> 22:46.320
what the fuck happened to this place?

22:46.400 --> 22:48.640
It looks like New Jersey
on the Fourth of July.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.640
[in Norwegian] You better talk
to Torgeir about that. Just have to...

22:55.280 --> 22:56.840
[door closes]

23:17.880 --> 23:20.720
[in English] Rise and shine, boys.
Rise and shine.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.560
[in Norwegian]
Oh, my God.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.680
[Johnny in English] I hope we made
boatloads of money last night

23:25.760 --> 23:28.200
because it looks like
the rodeo stopped by.

23:28.280 --> 23:33.600
[in Norwegian]
Um, not that much.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.000
It was more of a private arrangement.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.680
[in English]
Oh, look at this,

23:38.760 --> 23:40.560
you got beat up too, huh?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.280
Who did that?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.040
Oy vey.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.600
We just had a little bit of a quarrel.

23:48.680 --> 23:52.120
Oh, boys.
Okay.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.560
Let me explain.
Let me try and, uh, explain.

23:57.080 --> 24:02.080
Our costs are skyrocketing
since the smuggled booze dried up. Huh?

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
Our profit margins are dick.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.360
If you two don't get it together,

24:08.440 --> 24:11.000
we are fucking doomed.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.760
- Yep.
- We read you, boss. We read you.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.760
And it's totally, uh,

24:15.840 --> 24:17.440
unacceptable.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.360
[in Norwegian] We simply have to pull
ourselves together.

24:25.680 --> 24:27.720
[vacuum humming]

24:34.400 --> 24:35.800
[in English]
Hey, boss. Boss?

24:35.880 --> 24:37.240
The cop lady is here again.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.800
I'm out of town.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.760
[grunts]

24:43.440 --> 24:45.160
Ah, jeez.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.600
No card games today, Officer.

24:50.680 --> 24:53.640
As you can see, we have a new hobby
in housekeeping.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.600
Mm. Lovely.

24:56.680 --> 25:00.200
[in Norwegian] What about intelligence
gathering, is that a hobby of yours too?

25:00.280 --> 25:03.800
[in English]
All right, boys, take a break.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.400
I know that you're
in contact with PST.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.840
PST?

25:08.920 --> 25:10.840
Is that some kind
of new social disease?

25:10.920 --> 25:12.840
Don't act stupid.

25:12.920 --> 25:17.400
Look, Aadne Bryhn, he works
for Norwegian Homeland Security.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.200
And I saw you with him.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
That's what he does for a living.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.360
You know, I always wondered.

25:27.440 --> 25:30.880
We share a fascination
for Norwegian Satan rock.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.560
That's why we hang out.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.680
Really? You don't seem
like the black metal type.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.640
Well, between me and you,

25:39.720 --> 25:42.440
me and Metalluka, like this.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.720
[cell phone buzzing]

25:45.800 --> 25:47.000
Excuse me.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.760
- Yeah, Tommy.
- We found him.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.760
- All right.
- He's down here at Aker Brygge.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.760
- All right, stay there.
- You coming down here?

25:54.840 --> 25:56.160
Yeah, my meeting is over.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.920
[sighs]

26:08.000 --> 26:09.400
Anything?

26:09.480 --> 26:12.040
[Zlatan in Norwegian]
Not yet. But, brother,

26:12.120 --> 26:15.560
my friend has seen one of the guys
shop here every Friday.

26:15.640 --> 26:17.960
[in English]
So they're probably hiding out

26:18.040 --> 26:20.680
in one of those fancy Aker Brygge cribs.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.440
[in Norwegian]
What's going on?

26:24.520 --> 26:26.280
What's up with all the questions?

26:28.160 --> 26:31.120
You know what happened
to the cat that was too curious?

26:31.200 --> 26:32.440
No.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.480
He was paralyzed
from the waist down.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.240
- Just stop asking questions.
- [Zlatan in English] Hey.

26:38.320 --> 26:41.440
- The eagle has landed.
- [Johnny] You sure?

26:43.720 --> 26:45.200
Told you.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.840
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
Is that our guy?

26:46.920 --> 26:48.960
[Zlatan]
Yes, definitely.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.720
[Johhny in English] What's he doing?
What's he doing?

26:53.320 --> 26:56.040
[in Norwegian]
Looks like he is having a taco party.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.480
[Johnny in English]
Come again?

26:57.560 --> 26:59.600
Norwegian tradition.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.400
We eat Mexican food

27:01.480 --> 27:04.880
and watch  Gullrekka,

27:04.960 --> 27:07.120
Goldyrow, on TV.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.240
Don't look at me, man.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.600
[in Norwegian] I've been here for 18 years
and I still don't have a clue.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.160
[Torgeir]
He's going around the corner.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.800
[in English] Can you see
which apartment he's looking at?

27:29.880 --> 27:33.280
[Torgeir in Norwegian] Looks more like
he's going for a swim.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.680
[in English]
Jesus fuck, he's getting into a boat.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.480
[in Norwegian]
Seriously?

27:59.400 --> 28:00.760
[Johnny in English]
Okay.

28:00.840 --> 28:02.760
Anybody know how to hot-wire a boat?

28:02.840 --> 28:04.440
[in Norwegian]
We can't steal a boat in broad daylight

28:04.520 --> 28:06.520
in the middle of Aker Brygge.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.000
[in English]
I'm on parole, for God's sake.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.200
We can't let him get away, can we?

28:11.280 --> 28:14.320
Any ideas you got, uh, now's the time.

28:15.920 --> 28:19.000
[in Norwegian] Well, what about
those kayaks over there?

28:19.080 --> 28:23.360
I'd like to see who voluntarily
goes into this water.

28:29.720 --> 28:30.880
Okay.

28:34.760 --> 28:36.640
Okay.

29:17.400 --> 29:20.880
[Torgeir] I saw them hide the bags
with the stash under the sofa at the hut,

29:20.960 --> 29:23.480
which is situated north,
on the island here.

29:23.560 --> 29:26.880
And the fuse box is on the outside.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.360
[in English] Okay,
so here's the plan, right.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.880
Tommy, you and that Yugoslavian
Clint Eastwood, you stay on the boat.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.480
If you have to move,
be back first in 30 minutes,  capisce?

29:36.560 --> 29:37.800
Okay.

29:37.880 --> 29:41.280
All right,
the four of us come up here,

29:41.360 --> 29:43.880
do a little surveillance on the cabin.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.760
At the right time, Torge?

29:45.840 --> 29:48.000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Johnny] You blow the power.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.920
If it's working,
they come running out,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.760
we sneak around back,

29:52.840 --> 29:55.680
break in, where the stash is.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.200
- Genius.
- [in Norwegian] That's wicked!

29:58.280 --> 29:59.840
[in English]
It's like  Reservoir Dogs.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.560
Yeah.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.120
Let's just hope it ends a little bit
better for us than it did for those guys.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.520
- Maybe we should use code names?
- [cell phone ringing]

30:06.600 --> 30:10.520
You know, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blue,
maybe Mr. Orange?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.840
And why would we do that?

30:12.920 --> 30:14.800
Because they have it in the movie.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.240
Yeah, but they didn't know
each other's names in the movie.

30:18.320 --> 30:21.000
We do. So...

30:21.080 --> 30:23.280
[in Norwegian] It's just that it
would have been kind of cool, that's all.

30:23.360 --> 30:26.880
[Johnny in English] Keep in mind
tomorrow night is not a movie, huh?

30:26.960 --> 30:29.360
[man on radio]
The subject at hand today is birds.

30:29.440 --> 30:32.520
I was at a flea market here in town.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.800
They had a whole bunch
of different kinds of birds

30:34.880 --> 30:38.920
and they were cramped
into these little itty-bitty cages.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.240
[woman]
Horrible.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.480
- [man]  It-- Yeah.
- [woman]  Horrible.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.320
[man]
Yeah, it was--

30:43.400 --> 30:45.600
-  [woman]  Yeah, I know--
-  [man]  It didn't take a genius

30:45.680 --> 30:50.240
to see that they were not in a cage

30:50.320 --> 30:52.440
that was hospitable
to their wellbeing at all, so.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.160
[sobbing]

31:07.440 --> 31:10.680
[guard in Norwegian on PA]
Hey, you, in front of the animal store.

31:10.760 --> 31:14.120
The mall is closed. Please leave the area.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.760
Everyone must leave the area.

31:33.240 --> 31:35.240
[birds chirping]

31:49.320 --> 31:51.240
[Randi in Norwegian]
Hello, little friend.

31:53.080 --> 31:54.880
What have we done to you?

31:54.960 --> 31:56.360
[bird squawking]

31:56.440 --> 31:58.480
Hmm?

31:58.560 --> 32:00.800
You're supposed to fly around
in the rain forest.

32:00.880 --> 32:02.840
[gasps]

32:02.920 --> 32:04.920
[squawking]

32:05.000 --> 32:06.120
Little friend.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.000
[bird squawking]

32:27.840 --> 32:29.280
[squawks]

32:41.880 --> 32:43.280
[door closes]

32:53.520 --> 32:56.160
How could you do this to me?

32:57.520 --> 32:59.680
The contract with the Norwegian
Directorate of Immigration

32:59.760 --> 33:01.240
is in your name.

33:01.320 --> 33:05.160
I am totally dependent
on you to run that center.

33:05.240 --> 33:08.400
Release a bunch of parrots.
What got into you?

33:10.200 --> 33:12.240
[Randi]
Everything is not about you, Jan.

33:12.320 --> 33:17.440
It just pains me to see such exotic
creatures locked up all their lives.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.280
Are we really talking about
parrots now, Randi?

33:21.360 --> 33:23.840
No, I guess we're not.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.160
But we don't put anyone in cages.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.360
We help the refugees
spread their wings--

33:28.440 --> 33:30.240
If you say so.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.840
- Are you back on the khat?
- Yes.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.720
[sighs]

33:40.200 --> 33:41.880
I've talked to the police.
You can go.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.440
- Have you been with someone else tonight?
- Hmm?

33:44.520 --> 33:47.360
No need to deny it.
I recognize the smell of pussy.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.680
You have no idea how it hurts me...

33:51.800 --> 33:54.440
...that you would think something
like that about me.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.040
You're really something, Jan.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.840
[laughs]

33:58.920 --> 34:00.480
Anyway, it doesn't matter now.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.560
I have sent a letter of concern
to the Directorate.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.760
You did what?

34:04.840 --> 34:07.240
I told them everything.
About my khat abuse,

34:07.320 --> 34:09.160
how you've been
feeling up the young girls,

34:09.240 --> 34:11.840
and how we're in the back pocket
of that cynical bar owner.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.560
Guess you'll just have have
to find something else to do.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.920
Bye then, Jan.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.120
Randi.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.320
Maybe you could tell me
what's going on here?

34:31.960 --> 34:34.040
[in English]
Okay.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.480
Criminals have acquired
some information about my past

34:37.560 --> 34:39.280
and I gotta get it back.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.240
Your past?

34:41.320 --> 34:42.840
My past.

34:44.160 --> 34:46.080
Your CIA past?

34:46.160 --> 34:48.320
Jesus fucking Christ.

34:48.400 --> 34:49.960
So no more questions, all right?

34:50.040 --> 34:53.000
- No, my lips--
- Yeah, yeah, keep them glued.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.240
Yeah.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.640
[Zlatan whistling]

35:07.400 --> 35:10.480
[in Norwegian]
Ship ahoy, comrades.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.400
This fisherman is a buddy of yours?

35:15.480 --> 35:18.520
No, he runs a rehab joint
for drug addicts.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.400
They build wooden boats
instead of getting high.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.520
- [Torgeir] Really?
- [Thomas] Everything is tip-top.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.800
Now, this is becoming quite a gathering.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.280
[in English] Yeah, this is
how Australia got started.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.800
[in Norwegian] You wouldn't happen
to have a life jacket?

35:39.880 --> 35:44.360
Yes, I have matching reflectors
and seamen caps in that locker.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.440
Are you stupid?

35:47.520 --> 35:49.120
If something happens,
it's every man for himself.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.880
You know, just like having a wank.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.640
[in English] All right, I'll see
you guys in 30 minutes.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.600
- [TV playing indistinctly]
- [laughing and chattering inside]

36:32.120 --> 36:34.640
Okay, Torge, go do it.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.840
[laughing and chattering inside]

37:04.920 --> 37:06.600
[laughing and chattering]

37:12.720 --> 37:13.800
Okay, boys.

37:19.160 --> 37:20.280
Let's go.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.760
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
Under the sofa.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.080
- [Arne] Nothing here.
- What?

37:52.160 --> 37:53.880
[Arne]
Not one fucking bag here.

37:53.960 --> 37:57.120
What the fuck are you talking about?
I saw them put it here.

37:57.200 --> 37:59.040
[Arne] There's nothing here,
Torgeir, okay!

38:02.680 --> 38:04.160
Come on, hurry up!

38:08.600 --> 38:12.080
[Johnny in English] Explain this
one more time, because I gotta tell you,

38:12.160 --> 38:13.600
I still don't fucking
understand what happened.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.080
[Torgeir in Norwegian]
We looked everywhere--

38:15.160 --> 38:16.560
- [in English] You looked?
- Yeah, it wasn't there.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.040
I saw him put it under the sofa.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.320
Oh, God. They've captured
Thomas and Zlatan.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.520
Hello.

38:29.600 --> 38:31.160
I don't think so.

38:35.120 --> 38:38.120
Tommy boy,
you never fucking learn, do you?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.960
[in Norwegian]
You put it so neatly yourself.

38:42.040 --> 38:46.280
[in English] Let's focus less on the past
and more on the future. Well...

38:46.360 --> 38:50.800
[in Norwegian] I figured my future earning
potential was higher with these guys.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.880
[in English]
I had a look at your file.

38:54.960 --> 38:58.280
[in Norwegian] We obviously didn't know
the value of the information we had.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.120
Now that we do...

39:00.200 --> 39:02.000
[in English]
...we can strike a deal.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.200
Okay, I'm intrigued.

39:08.280 --> 39:13.280
[in Norwegian] One week,
one million kroner in unmarked bills.

39:13.360 --> 39:15.040
[in English]
What's this? Pick a number?

39:15.120 --> 39:16.960
We ain't got that kind of money.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.920
[Bamse] You got one week,
or we sell it to someone else.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.240
You know what that is, boys?

39:59.560 --> 40:02.000
Our entire cash reserve.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.120
Looks a bit thin.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.760
Ah.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.200
Very observational.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.160
Could you explain to me
how it got so thin?

40:12.240 --> 40:13.760
[in Norwegian]
You know the reason.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.440
Getting the booze
from the Vinmonopolet is expensive.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.160
In addition we had some...

40:17.240 --> 40:20.520
[in English] ...unforeseen expenses
when Mom got here.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.760
What's this got to do
with your mom's arrival?

40:26.840 --> 40:30.960
[in Norwegian] That's something
I have to account for.

40:31.040 --> 40:36.360
We'll take an exact account
of all family related expenses.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.440
[in English]
Just withdraw that from our salaries.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.640
- No problem.
- Mm.

40:40.720 --> 40:45.480
And how are your two salaries
gonna pay my bills next week?

40:48.560 --> 40:50.640
That's a hard nut to crack.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.920
Give me a day
and I'll think about it.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.320
- We can crack, uh, the nut.
- Yeah, we can.

41:02.600 --> 41:05.800
Oh, Janny boy.
Am I glad to see you.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.440
Jan, you okay?

41:08.520 --> 41:11.440
[in Norwegian]
Just had to have a couple of beers.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.160
[in English]
Oh, boy.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.200
Yeah, a couple maybe, huh?

41:15.280 --> 41:19.160
A couple too many, maybe.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.040
I hate to break up party night,
but listen,

41:21.120 --> 41:22.800
I've got a cash flow problem.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.720
You gotta siphon
some dough from the refugees.

41:25.800 --> 41:30.360
[in Norwegian] Nothing more to get
from there, I think.

41:30.440 --> 41:33.080
[in English] What are you talking about?
You were doing great over there?

41:33.160 --> 41:34.600
[in Norwegian]
Yeah.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.480
Just had a little setback.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.400
It'll come around next week, I'm sure.

41:39.480 --> 41:40.760
[coughs]

41:40.840 --> 41:42.160
[in English]
Excuse me.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.280
Excuse me.

41:45.840 --> 41:47.560
[coughs]

41:47.640 --> 41:49.640
[retching]

41:49.720 --> 41:52.600
[in Norwegian]
Did Jan have any useful ideas?

41:57.000 --> 41:58.480
[in English]
I guess not.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.960
[Johnny]
What can I do for you, pal?

42:03.040 --> 42:05.240
[in Norwegian]
That's Mom's boyfriend.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.800
Hope I'm not interrupting.

42:10.880 --> 42:13.240
[in English] I got a business opportunity
I want to pitch to you.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.680
[in Norwegian]
You're interrupting big-time.

42:14.760 --> 42:18.040
We are having
an executive meeting here, so...

42:18.120 --> 42:20.160
[in English]
Stanley's just about to leave.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.920
Now, now, let's not be hasty,
Mr. Managing Director.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
After all, he's practically
part of the family.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.720
Let's hear what he has to say.

42:29.640 --> 42:33.520
[in Norwegian] Before I became religious,
I played some music.

42:36.320 --> 42:38.520
Hi, guys.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.320
This is my old band.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.280
[Johhny in English]
How are you doing?

42:42.360 --> 42:46.120
[in Norwegian] We're gonna fit perfectly
with Flamingo's profile.

42:51.520 --> 42:53.840
[in English]
Oh! This is beautiful.

42:53.920 --> 42:55.920
This is music to my eyes.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.280
- I love this.
- [Stanley] Yeah.

42:57.360 --> 42:59.160
I listened when you talk to the boys

42:59.240 --> 43:02.440
and I knew you got some liquor problem.

43:02.520 --> 43:04.320
Huh.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.160
I'm afraid to ask.
What's the deal?

43:07.240 --> 43:09.320
Well, I checked the numbers with Roar.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.400
We are cheaper than the last guy.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.560
[chuckles]

43:15.640 --> 43:17.240
You know,

43:17.320 --> 43:20.040
I've been in a bit
of a dark tunnel lately.

43:20.120 --> 43:23.360
You showed me a little light.
Thank you.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.360
The kids could use
a father figure like you.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.280
[Johnny and Stanley chuckle]

43:27.360 --> 43:29.280
- [Stanley] Yeah.
- [Johnny] Let's have a drink.

43:29.360 --> 43:30.920
[Stanley]
Okay.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.440
[Moby Grapes' "Can't Be So Bad" playing]
