00:29.831 --> 00:32.567
<i>There's a fine line
between poverty and prosperity.</i>

00:33.868 --> 00:38.405
<i>Just look around you.
It's everywhere.</i>

00:38.438 --> 00:41.509
<i>We all get down on our knees and
pray to the same God, don't we?</i>

00:43.243 --> 00:45.780
<i>Block after block of
million-dollar mega churches,</i>

00:45.813 --> 00:47.849
<i>and at the same time
we got millions of people</i>

00:47.882 --> 00:50.117
<i>stuck in the vice-like grip
of poverty.</i>

00:51.519 --> 00:55.523
<i>When I look around,
all I see are the forgotten,</i>

00:55.557 --> 00:57.324
<i>those tossed aside
by the powers that be,</i>

00:57.357 --> 01:01.461
<i>that somehow missed out
on the American dream.</i>

01:01.495 --> 01:04.131
<i>That's why I believe
that if you want something,</i>

01:04.164 --> 01:06.668
<i>you've got to find it,
or take it.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:15.409
<i>I've been scouring these swamps for
buried treasures for my whole life,</i>

01:15.442 --> 01:18.713
<i>and the only thing I've come away
with are lost and discarded souls.</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:23.317
<i>But my love is too strong
to look the other way.</i>

01:23.350 --> 01:27.722
<i>So, I take them in,
teaching the ways of prosperity.</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:30.190
<i>And together we take
what is rightfully ours.</i>

01:31.793 --> 01:35.730
<i>From the earliest Conquistadors
to the Cocaine Cowboys,</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:38.432
<i>these swamps have always
held hidden bounty.</i>

01:40.267 --> 01:42.436
<i>I believe it because
I've dreamed it.</i>

01:44.505 --> 01:46.239
<i>And now I just got
to go find it.</i>

01:59.353 --> 02:00.655
Put your mask on.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.327
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.897
Let me see.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.198
How bad is it?
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

02:45.232 --> 02:46.366
Hey, look at me.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.836
You're good. You're good.
Go to the car. Go to the car.

02:52.607 --> 02:55.475
Kayla, wake up.
Come on, wake up.

02:55.977 --> 02:57.444
Kayla? Kayla?

03:16.363 --> 03:17.699
Go. Go, go, go!

03:24.438 --> 03:27.008
- Let's see how bad is it.
- Fuck.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.776
- Stop. Let me fucking see.
- Fuck!

03:28.810 --> 03:29.844
What happened
back there?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.245
- Go to the hospital.
- No hospitals.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.447
It's just shrapnel, bro.

03:35.550 --> 03:37.417
- What the fuck happened back there?
- Keep driving, bro.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.720
What the...

03:38.753 --> 03:40.621
Cody?

03:40.655 --> 03:41.689
Fuck.

03:43.925 --> 03:45.425
What the fuck?

03:47.829 --> 03:49.329
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

03:50.865 --> 03:52.365
Come on.

03:57.572 --> 04:00.842
Cody, she's roadkill.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.811
I'm not leaving her. Help.

04:03.845 --> 04:05.747
Shit, is she dead?

04:05.780 --> 04:06.781
What the fuck?

04:15.056 --> 04:16.356
Get in the car.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.929
What the fuck!

04:21.963 --> 04:24.999
Go. Go, go!

04:40.648 --> 04:43.316
God damn, brother,
fortune favors the bold,

04:43.350 --> 04:44.685
- am I right?
- You're right.

04:44.719 --> 04:47.688
I mean, fuck, every year you
hear about fossils being found,

04:47.722 --> 04:48.956
Confederate gold...

04:48.990 --> 04:51.692
No one ever believes,
it's always a myth until it happens.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.327
Right? And if it's not us,
it's gonna be someone else.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.730
- That's right.
- Right?

04:55.763 --> 04:58.800
Just fucking indulge me, man.
Would you?

04:58.833 --> 05:00.835
Yeah, I'm in.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.804
That's it.
That's it, you know?

05:02.837 --> 05:04.739
Hey. You guys need something?

05:05.907 --> 05:08.408
- Say it again?
- You guys need something?

05:10.011 --> 05:14.749
- Such as?
- I got Xans, Oxys, Percs.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.584
Just trying to get
some shit off me.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.653
- Why don't you take a seat?
- Yeah, come on.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.988
No, I ain't fucking sitting down, man.
I... I really got to go.

05:21.022 --> 05:22.690
So, you guys want some or not?

05:26.426 --> 05:27.728
We'll buy all of it.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.098
All right, you do that.

05:31.132 --> 05:32.800
On one condition.

05:32.834 --> 05:34.669
What you doing, man?
Get the fuck off me.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.636
Tell me where you got
the drugs from.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.138
No, man, what are you,
a cop or something?

05:37.171 --> 05:38.806
- Do I look like a goddamn cop?
- I don't know, man. Get the fuck off me.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.242
- Not until you tell me where the fuck you got these from.
- All right. Okay, okay.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.979
I got it from the liquor store down
the street. It's called Aroma, okay?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.547
Give me the drugs.

05:46.581 --> 05:49.116
- Put them on the table.
- All right. All right.

05:49.150 --> 05:51.484
- Get.
- Girl, you forgot your money.

05:53.054 --> 05:55.422
That's fucking crazy, man.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.591
It's a goddamn shame.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.660
- It's a shame, man.
- It has lost you.

05:59.694 --> 06:01.428
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

06:03.798 --> 06:04.932
Excuse me.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.701
Yeah.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.071
What happened?

06:10.104 --> 06:11.105
Trey's been shot.

06:12.439 --> 06:13.841
Fucking bang!

06:15.743 --> 06:17.645
Get the fuck out of the car.
I'm driving.

06:24.919 --> 06:26.020
Hang in there, bud.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.793
Cyrus, give me
your flashlight, buddy.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.663
Thank you, son.
Easy now, come on.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.464
You're gonna tell him,
or I will.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.567
- Fuck you.
- It's gonna hurt just a little bit, okay?

06:39.600 --> 06:42.203
I need you to breathe.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.606
Hey, hey, look at me,
it's a flesh wound.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.709
You're gonna be
just fine, okay?

06:50.978 --> 06:52.980
Cyrus, get him
cleaned up, buddy.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.449
He can do it himself.
It's just shrapnel.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.190
Fine.

07:14.769 --> 07:15.836
Cody.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.439
What am I not being told?

07:23.044 --> 07:24.178
Something's not right.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.929
Why is there a bloodied-up little
girl in the back of this truck?

07:42.730 --> 07:43.731
Um...

07:45.166 --> 07:48.202
I asked you a question,
goddamn it. Speak.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.705
We hit her with the truck.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.207
So, you decide
to bring her here?

07:54.642 --> 07:55.643
I didn't.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.647
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.682
Who is she?

08:01.716 --> 08:03.918
I don't know. She just
stepped in front of the truck and...

08:03.951 --> 08:06.821
You boys are going to take this
truck, dump it in the swamp,

08:06.854 --> 08:09.757
put a bullet in her goddamn head
and let the gators do the rest.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.560
You understand me?
I want you back before the sun comes up.

08:17.098 --> 08:19.499
- Stay here, I'll take care of it.
- Shut the fuck up.

08:20.201 --> 08:21.569
I'll drive. Get in.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.680
Hurry up.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.081
This place is creepy as fuck.

08:58.172 --> 08:59.974
She didn't do anything.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.308
Just do it,
I gotta take a piss.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.190
We pulled three bodies
from the rubble,

09:49.223 --> 09:51.959
- two adults, one child.
- Witnesses?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.994
<i>Neighbors heard</i>
<i>gunshots around 1:00 a.m.</i>

09:54.028 --> 09:55.830
- <i>No one saw anything.</i>
- <i>What else?</i>

09:57.298 --> 10:00.768
Well, kind of looks like
the other two meth labs.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.737
<i>Come on, hun,
again with the conspiracy?</i>

10:03.771 --> 10:05.773
<i>Looks like a double
whammy to me.</i>

10:05.806 --> 10:07.208
Just let forensics
do their thing.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.772
<i>You know, you all remind me
of a story my grandfather told me</i>

10:38.806 --> 10:41.709
<i>when I was about
14, 15 years old.</i>

10:41.742 --> 10:44.278
It's about these two bulls
standing on a hillside,

10:44.311 --> 10:49.316
overlooking this pasture
full of cows.

10:49.350 --> 10:53.821
The young bull kind of looks up at the
old bull and says... all cocky and stuff.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.790
He says, "Hey, let's run down there
and fuck us one of them cows."

10:58.292 --> 11:00.461
The old bull looks down
at him and says,

11:00.494 --> 11:04.131
"No... how about we just walk
down there and fuck 'em all?"

11:05.466 --> 11:08.435
I sent you out there to get
information for me, what you got?

11:08.469 --> 11:11.805
These cocksuckers ain't talking yet,
man, but it's only a matter of time.

11:13.407 --> 11:16.076
I got a wrecking crew
ready to go.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.180
If you boys can't handle it,
I'm going to bring them into this thing.

11:19.213 --> 11:21.482
- Fuck that. We got this.
- Then, unass my area,

11:21.516 --> 11:24.051
and go out there and find out
who's fucking up my labs.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.743
<i>The weather
today in Moss County,</i>

11:49.777 --> 11:51.345
<i>a high of 92 degrees...</i>

11:54.181 --> 11:56.817
<i>In other news,
local authorities are investigating</i>

11:56.850 --> 11:58.052
<i>a trailer fire that left...</i>

11:58.085 --> 11:59.453
<i>...two adults and one child dead</i>

11:59.486 --> 12:01.956
<i>after the trailer
burst into flames.</i>

12:01.989 --> 12:04.992
<i>The sheriff's department are labeling
the incident as drug-related,</i>

12:05.025 --> 12:06.760
<i>and it's believed that
the source of the fire</i>

12:06.794 --> 12:09.063
<i>was caused by
a meth lab explosion.</i>

12:09.096 --> 12:11.265
<i>Stay tuned
for more news at 5:00.</i>

12:11.298 --> 12:15.469
<i>Up next is the new track,</i>
Swampy Love <i>by Johnny and the Rockets.</i>

12:15.503 --> 12:18.005
- I gotta go, really.
- Just stay, baby.

12:19.340 --> 12:22.309
Every time you leave,
it just breaks my heart.

12:22.343 --> 12:24.011
You know
I can't do that.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.147
Look around you,
I'll give you everything I got

12:27.181 --> 12:31.252
just to wake up next to this
beautiful body of yours.

12:31.285 --> 12:35.222
- Bye, baby.
- See you soon?

12:35.256 --> 12:36.890
You know where
to find me.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.226
- All good?
- Yeah.

13:21.569 --> 13:22.570
That dude's gross.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.840
You didn't have to fuck him,
why do you care?

13:28.242 --> 13:31.345
He's old, lonely, fucking rich.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.147
How much are you
pooling in, anyways?

14:11.553 --> 14:12.587
Fuck's your problem?

14:13.287 --> 14:14.355
How did it go?

14:14.388 --> 14:17.224
- It's all over the news, you know.
- I heard.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.660
There were kids in the fire.

14:18.693 --> 14:20.394
Those were bad people, son.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.596
- You know that.
- But...

14:21.629 --> 14:23.997
Enough, goddamn it.

14:24.031 --> 14:27.602
I need you to get that out of your
head and fast, you understand me?

14:27.635 --> 14:30.904
The shit that transpired
in that house was God's will,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.073
not our fault, not our problem.

14:33.107 --> 14:34.308
The shit that they
were cooking up

14:34.341 --> 14:35.777
would've ended up
on the streets,

14:35.810 --> 14:38.946
probably in the hands of some
God-fearing people. I can't have that.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.315
And I can't have my fucking
kid getting all bamboozled

14:41.348 --> 14:45.185
every time someone gets robbed or some
tweaker kid gets what he has coming to him.

14:45.219 --> 14:48.122
It's fucking weakness, son.
I need you to be strong.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.928
One day,
when I'm dead and gone...

14:56.997 --> 14:59.466
you're going to reflect back
on what we're doing here,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.468
that it was for the betterment
of the world.

15:05.540 --> 15:06.541
Understand?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.912
Damn, son.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.281
Stubborn kid.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.422
Now...

15:21.455 --> 15:24.358
I want you to go tell your
brothers to get the fuck over here.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.628
We've got some planning to do.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.423
- You're in my seat.
- You said you weren't hungry.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.658
I changed my mind.

16:33.628 --> 16:34.629
Hello,
how are you today?

16:34.662 --> 16:37.599
- Hey, good. How are you?
- I'm good. Uh, the usual?

16:37.632 --> 16:39.299
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.335
- Oh, and Jazz?
- Yeah?

16:41.368 --> 16:44.338
- You're staying out of trouble?
- Yes, I'm trying.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.074
- Can I get a coffee too?
- Yeah, no problem. Be right up.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.209
Just came in.

16:56.684 --> 16:58.285
Only the man was shot?

16:58.318 --> 17:01.021
Yeah, the woman and the kids
were killed by the fire.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.525
We're going homicide?

17:04.526 --> 17:06.326
DA doesn't want it.

17:06.360 --> 17:08.696
- They're pushing to call it a meth lab fire.
- What?

17:10.297 --> 17:12.800
Come on. I don't know,
something's off.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.302
Don't shoot the messenger.

17:18.773 --> 17:20.474
Really?

17:38.626 --> 17:42.129
- Hey, Captain.
- Hey, what's up, Ellis?

17:42.162 --> 17:46.099
Ballistics report from that
burned-out trailer in Inverness.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.435
- I thought that case was already closed.
- Not really.

17:48.468 --> 17:52.172
Ballistics matched a slug we pulled
from a robbery near Lecanto back in May.

17:52.205 --> 17:55.743
- Okay, so?
- So, that means this wasn't random.

17:55.777 --> 17:57.879
- I pulled the other two reports.
- Where you going with this?

17:57.912 --> 18:01.348
The DA's office wants nothing to
do with this, the case is closed.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.384
- Well, if you...
- Look, I'm sure you have other cases,

18:04.418 --> 18:07.254
open cases that you need
to follow up on, right?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.156
Would you look at the report,
please, sir?

18:09.691 --> 18:11.158
Close the damn door.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.799
Sit down.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.373
Ellis, may I remind you
that you're still under review?

18:26.406 --> 18:28.843
- Come on.
- Look, you punched an officer in the face.

18:28.876 --> 18:30.177
You broke his damn nose.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.847
He grabbed my ass.
He's lucky I didn't break something else.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.484
Look, the boys aren't used to working
with a woman in your position.

18:37.518 --> 18:39.687
Well, I'm sure the boys
will get over it.

18:39.721 --> 18:42.690
Ellis, do as you're told,
or I'll assign you to desk duty,

18:42.724 --> 18:44.458
do you understand me?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.259
Now, get the hell
out of my office.

19:02.543 --> 19:03.711
So, how did it go?

19:06.814 --> 19:10.718
Wow, gold star, really?
Who's my little scientist?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.320
That's right.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.290
I'll be home soon, bug.

19:18.059 --> 19:19.761
Um, let me talk
to daddy, okay?

19:21.896 --> 19:23.931
Bye. Hey.

19:26.601 --> 19:30.571
Uh, yeah, not yet.
Just work stuff.

19:30.605 --> 19:32.940
I'm gonna be a little bit
late, but I'll be home soon.

19:40.014 --> 19:41.281
Hello.

19:44.652 --> 19:46.154
Well, hello there, officer.

19:48.022 --> 19:51.191
- Am I in some sort of trouble?
- Come here.

19:52.593 --> 19:54.529
You're no fun.

19:54.562 --> 19:58.966
It's just... I'm in
cop mode all day, every day.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.835
I don't want to do
that right now.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.402
Play along.

20:07.942 --> 20:09.276
Ma'am...

20:11.311 --> 20:12.880
Is there a problem, officer?

20:12.914 --> 20:15.248
Seems there's a 10-70.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.919
- 10-70?
- Fire in progress.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.722
We're gonna need your towel.

20:21.989 --> 20:25.292
Well, then,
your wish is my command.

21:34.128 --> 21:35.395
What's your name?

21:37.364 --> 21:39.466
Hey, can you hear me?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.989
Don't worry, you're safe.

22:02.023 --> 22:04.959
- What was that?
- Daisy.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.995
Hi, Daisy. I'm Cody.

22:11.498 --> 22:12.700
What are you up to later?

22:16.103 --> 22:17.370
What?

22:19.640 --> 22:24.377
You told me you didn't want me to
talk about... what I do out there.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.948
I'm sorry. I know.
Never mind.

22:30.117 --> 22:31.619
What's wrong?

22:32.787 --> 22:35.122
Nothing.

22:37.859 --> 22:40.127
Come on. You can tell me.

22:42.063 --> 22:43.396
Um...

22:48.502 --> 22:49.670
I, uh...

22:52.139 --> 22:54.508
I wish you'd quit.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.844
I wish you'd quit all that shit.

22:58.746 --> 22:59.814
It's not fair.

23:02.650 --> 23:03.885
Yeah, I know.

23:06.020 --> 23:08.022
You're still fucking
married, so...

23:08.055 --> 23:09.790
It's complicated.
I can't. It's...

23:14.461 --> 23:16.964
Babes, life is complicated.
I mean...

23:18.232 --> 23:19.667
What do you want me to say?

23:20.668 --> 23:21.669
Yeah, I know. Nothing.

23:24.672 --> 23:25.840
Forget I said it, okay?

23:29.911 --> 23:31.012
I gotta go.

23:32.113 --> 23:33.480
I know.

23:36.150 --> 23:37.652
Can I get a smile?

23:51.966 --> 23:54.001
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:05.046 --> 24:08.649
Down, boys, on my cadence.

24:09.884 --> 24:12.787
One, two, three, four,

24:12.820 --> 24:15.056
fuck the man for he's a whore.

24:15.089 --> 24:19.794
Five, six, seven, eight,
make them all capitulate.

24:19.827 --> 24:24.532
One, two, three, four.
Gets what daddy has at store.

24:24.565 --> 24:28.903
Five, six, seven, eight,
a pound of love, an ounce of hate.

24:28.936 --> 24:31.906
One, two, three...
Guys, stop!

24:32.807 --> 24:35.743
Don't get up.
Stay down!

24:35.776 --> 24:38.746
The chain is only as strong as the
weakest link. You understand me?

24:38.779 --> 24:40.781
Do you want
to be the weakest link?

24:40.815 --> 24:42.984
- No, sir.
- Good. Fortitude.

24:43.017 --> 24:44.785
Fuck.

24:44.819 --> 24:46.921
Cyrus, give Trey some
of your fortitude.

24:46.954 --> 24:48.155
Again.

24:48.789 --> 24:54.261
One, two, three, four, five.

24:54.295 --> 24:57.264
Up. Trey.

24:57.298 --> 24:59.967
- Damn it, boys.
- Shut the fuck up.

25:01.202 --> 25:02.269
Hey!

25:03.304 --> 25:05.172
Enough. Enough, goddammit.

25:05.206 --> 25:08.109
On the mat, on the mat,
goddammit.

25:08.142 --> 25:11.712
When I say enough, enough.
You know how we do.

25:23.891 --> 25:26.093
Come on, dude.
Show me what you got.

25:41.075 --> 25:42.676
Just tap.

25:42.710 --> 25:43.844
Don't you let go.

25:45.780 --> 25:46.847
Don't let go.

25:46.881 --> 25:49.016
- He's gonna pass out.
- I don't give a shit.

25:49.050 --> 25:50.918
Your whole life is defined
by this moment.

25:50.951 --> 25:52.887
Don't you fucking let go.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.889
- Mack... stop.
- Don't... Get the fuck back.

25:54.922 --> 25:56.857
Hey!

25:56.891 --> 25:59.226
Hey, get the fuck off,
goddamn it!

25:59.260 --> 26:01.028
- Let him fucking do it!
- Get off of me.

26:01.062 --> 26:02.096
Mack.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.148
What the fuck did you do?

26:22.049 --> 26:23.284
I asked you, man.

26:24.351 --> 26:26.954
It's a goddamn order.

26:26.987 --> 26:29.690
It's like I am fucking losing
my fucking mind, man!

26:49.243 --> 26:50.711
What's your name, girl?

26:52.913 --> 26:54.081
Daisy.

26:56.050 --> 26:58.352
Well, Daisy,
you seem like a tough little girl.

27:01.956 --> 27:03.157
Do you know where you are?

27:07.928 --> 27:08.929
Do you know who I am?

27:14.969 --> 27:16.137
Where you from, darling?

27:20.474 --> 27:21.709
Nowhere.

27:23.410 --> 27:26.714
You got a mama?
A daddy?

27:32.119 --> 27:33.154
Sweetheart...

27:36.790 --> 27:40.227
I can't help you out
if you don't talk to me.

27:40.261 --> 27:41.695
Do you understand that?

27:45.499 --> 27:50.070
I'm going to ask you one more fucking time!
Where the fuck are you from?

27:50.104 --> 27:51.939
And I told you, mister.

27:51.972 --> 27:57.011
I ain't from nowhere. I ain't got
no family. Nowhere to go, okay?

28:03.918 --> 28:06.120
Okay. Okay.

28:06.153 --> 28:08.189
Okay. Okay.

28:10.224 --> 28:12.993
Lexy, get her cleaned up.
Maybe get her some clothes, please.

28:32.514 --> 28:33.814
You okay?

28:34.815 --> 28:35.816
Yes, ma'am.

28:42.990 --> 28:44.992
She's kind of pretty
underneath all that dirt.

28:50.364 --> 28:52.933
- What's your story?
- I ain't got one.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.242
My advice to you...

29:03.877 --> 29:05.479
get as far away from here
as possible.

29:08.148 --> 29:10.084
There ain't nothing good
coming from here.

29:16.023 --> 29:17.891
I'll leave some clothes
for you, on my bed.

30:09.476 --> 30:10.978
- Trey.
- Huh?

30:11.011 --> 30:14.348
Go inside, get me something to put
this chicken on. It's burning, quick.

30:24.559 --> 30:25.959
All right, all right,
all right.

30:36.604 --> 30:38.272
Dig in, darling,
don't be shy.

30:45.680 --> 30:49.483
You know... we might not
have much around here...

30:51.185 --> 30:53.053
but we have food on our plates

30:53.087 --> 30:54.888
and we have love in our
hearts for one another.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.259
Look around you.

30:59.293 --> 31:02.096
Everybody here came to me
in a similar fashion as you.

31:03.497 --> 31:06.100
We're all orphans, darling.

31:06.133 --> 31:10.204
But this here, this is a family
born of choice.

31:10.237 --> 31:12.206
And that is a powerful thing.

31:12.239 --> 31:13.374
You understand that?

31:15.342 --> 31:19.581
Sometimes water is thicker
than blood.

31:19.614 --> 31:23.250
And we were thinking,
since you ain't got no place to go...

31:24.719 --> 31:27.388
ain't nobody out here
looking for you, then...

31:27.421 --> 31:29.056
maybe you'd like
to join our family.

31:30.658 --> 31:32.560
- Yeah.
- Good.

31:35.028 --> 31:36.230
Good.

31:52.747 --> 32:00.354
And we have lost our connection to the
sacred nature of these ancient lands.

32:00.387 --> 32:03.591
Long before the white man ever
stepped foot on these shores,

32:03.625 --> 32:06.160
the Timucua Indians ruled
these lands.

32:07.261 --> 32:08.962
They believed in God,
just like we do.

32:10.532 --> 32:12.634
<i>And they believed
the first thing God did</i>

32:12.667 --> 32:15.503
<i>was create the spirit of water.</i>

32:15.537 --> 32:18.640
<i>With sheer force,
it bubbled up from deep within the earth,</i>

32:18.673 --> 32:20.941
<i>creating a homeland for
everything we know.</i>

32:23.076 --> 32:25.412
He then created those
who dwell in these waters.

32:27.114 --> 32:31.351
Some breathed above
and some breathed below.

32:31.385 --> 32:35.289
<i>But it is the bottom dwellers who
were given the most responsibility.</i>

32:35.322 --> 32:38.593
<i>They were tasked with holding
the land and trees in place.</i>

32:40.795 --> 32:43.497
You walk around on this land
and think you're on top of it.

32:44.364 --> 32:46.166
But you ain't.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.103
You're like us, of the bottom.

32:50.137 --> 32:53.641
<i>And it's God who put us here
to keep the balance.</i>

32:53.675 --> 32:58.378
<i>He brought you to me because you've
forgotten who you really are.</i>

32:58.412 --> 33:02.483
<i>All the pain, all the
jealousy, all the envy...</i>

33:03.718 --> 33:07.522
<i>it's clouded your mind
and your heart.</i>

33:07.555 --> 33:12.159
<i>So time and time again,
we come back to these healing waters.</i>

33:12.192 --> 33:14.662
<i>We cleanse our souls
and become born again.</i>

33:17.264 --> 33:19.199
<i>Are you ready
to be reborn, darling?</i>

33:20.200 --> 33:21.503
Heavenly Father,

33:21.536 --> 33:23.805
we thank you that by water
and the Holy Spirit

33:23.838 --> 33:27.241
you have bestowed upon us your
servants, the gift of forgiveness.

33:30.444 --> 33:31.746
<i>Dear Lord...</i>

33:33.447 --> 33:36.350
take this little girl
into your loving arms,

33:36.383 --> 33:41.355
hold and protector, guide her from
harm, and fill her days

33:42.122 --> 33:43.123
with love and joy.

33:44.559 --> 33:45.560
<i>The past is dead.</i>

33:46.828 --> 33:51.533
We stand here free and whole
forever in the kingdom of Heaven.

33:54.602 --> 33:55.770
Amen.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.721
<i>We all have shit
that we need to kill.</i>

34:26.233 --> 34:27.401
Fuck it.

34:28.736 --> 34:30.337
Let's kill some shit.

34:32.272 --> 34:34.374
Cody, Trey, Daisy,
out of the way.

34:35.777 --> 34:37.779
Come on! Get, get, get!

34:45.553 --> 34:47.254
Show us how it's done, Bunton.

35:13.514 --> 35:15.583
Not bad. Cody, you're up.

35:15.617 --> 35:16.851
Can I try?

35:17.885 --> 35:19.286
Of course, darling.

35:20.454 --> 35:21.656
Come on.

35:34.468 --> 35:36.504
Easy now. Easy now.

35:36.537 --> 35:38.806
First off, you hold every gun
like it's a loaded gun.

35:39.172 --> 35:40.775
Understood?

35:40.808 --> 35:44.177
Secondly, you never point
a gun at somebody

35:44.211 --> 35:45.613
unless you plan
on putting them down.

35:46.914 --> 35:48.315
That make sense?

35:48.850 --> 35:51.919
All right. Now...

35:51.953 --> 35:56.223
the key to good shooting is learning
to control your inner demon.

36:01.395 --> 36:02.563
Got it?

36:03.865 --> 36:04.932
Fire when ready.

36:07.702 --> 36:11.806
Again. Inhale. Again.

36:20.014 --> 36:22.349
I got one last thing to do.

36:22.382 --> 36:25.853
A little birdie told me some
miscreant's selling pills to kids.

36:25.887 --> 36:27.454
I think it's time
we paid him a visit.

36:36.430 --> 36:38.231
Well, that will be 42.63.

36:41.368 --> 36:43.604
- Raj, do you mind if I use your pisser?
- Sure, my man.

36:43.638 --> 36:44.872
Here you go. No problem.

36:54.582 --> 36:55.983
Put the money
on the counter.

36:56.017 --> 36:57.685
Put the money on the counter!

36:57.719 --> 36:59.520
- Please.
- Hey!

36:59.554 --> 37:01.522
Look at my fucking eyes.
I am gonna shoot you in the head

37:01.556 --> 37:02.890
if you don't put
the money right now.

37:05.325 --> 37:06.861
There you go.

37:06.894 --> 37:08.361
- All of it! All of it!
- That's all I have.

37:08.395 --> 37:09.496
Where are the pills?

37:09.530 --> 37:11.398
You are one good
looking motherfucker.

37:14.035 --> 37:16.436
Terrence, we fucking tonight.

37:16.470 --> 37:18.740
- Don't fuck with me. Where are the pills?
- No pills.

37:18.773 --> 37:19.741
- Hey.
- No pills.

37:19.774 --> 37:21.042
I'm not fucking with you.
Look at my eyes.

37:21.075 --> 37:22.242
No pills.
Don't have no pills.

37:22.275 --> 37:24.277
- No pills. I have no pills.
- Don't you fucking...

37:27.782 --> 37:29.449
Jump him. Jump him.

37:41.863 --> 37:43.463
- Pills.
- I don't have no pills.

37:43.497 --> 37:45.800
- Where are the fucking pills?
- I don't have no pills.

37:45.833 --> 37:47.501
Don't fuck with me.
Get the pills.

37:47.535 --> 37:48.603
No pills.
I have no pills.

37:54.474 --> 37:55.743
Yeah.

37:57.912 --> 37:59.346
No pill? Huh?

38:00.014 --> 38:01.448
Cyrus.

39:29.804 --> 39:32.840
It is the paradigm of the
American political culture.

39:32.874 --> 39:36.476
It is identity politics and it is just
as arbitrary as rooting for your team.

39:38.045 --> 39:40.781
Miami Dolphins, or insert
your fucking sports team.

39:41.949 --> 39:44.785
Mack, man,
you're a fucking paradigm.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.521
Well, I ain't wrong.

39:48.656 --> 39:49.790
It's for you, darling.

39:50.457 --> 39:51.859
Hey, put that in your pocket.

39:53.227 --> 39:54.662
Mm.

40:09.677 --> 40:10.745
Gentlemen...

40:11.145 --> 40:12.445
You Mack?

40:15.116 --> 40:17.818
- Depends who's asking.
- We're asking, motherfucker.

40:18.719 --> 40:20.054
And who are you?

40:20.087 --> 40:21.689
Norvell's looking for your ass?

40:23.858 --> 40:25.593
I'm afraid that
don't ring familiar.

40:27.161 --> 40:28.162
Ooh.

41:06.267 --> 41:10.004
Mack fucking Monroe.

41:10.037 --> 41:12.807
I hear that you and your
backwoods gang of dipshits

41:12.840 --> 41:14.508
are out there
blowing up my labs.

41:16.110 --> 41:17.244
Did you serve, Mack?

41:19.547 --> 41:20.581
I did.

41:24.085 --> 41:26.020
Two tours. Iraq.

41:26.654 --> 41:28.689
Well...

41:28.723 --> 41:30.758
get that little trophy
from Iraq, too?

41:32.059 --> 41:33.060
It is.

41:34.795 --> 41:35.863
You know who I am?

41:37.965 --> 41:38.966
I do.

41:39.800 --> 41:40.868
You know who I am.

41:40.901 --> 41:43.704
You know what I do.
You know what I'm capable of.

41:45.306 --> 41:48.042
Yet you continuously
fuck with my operation.

41:49.610 --> 41:51.879
You must be one
crazy son of a bitch.

41:51.912 --> 41:53.547
Either that or you got
a death wish.

41:54.482 --> 41:56.550
I guess we'll figure that out
soon enough.

42:00.321 --> 42:01.889
And, you know,
let me tell you something.

42:01.922 --> 42:06.293
If I were you, I'd go home and do a
little bit of thinking about your future.

42:06.327 --> 42:08.162
Now you owe me, motherfucker.

42:08.195 --> 42:10.531
Fifty grand
and I'm coming to collect.

42:11.899 --> 42:14.035
Cody, Clay.

42:14.068 --> 42:16.704
You guys take this piece of
shit back where you found him.

42:17.371 --> 42:18.906
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

42:43.764 --> 42:45.766
Cody. Cody, what's up?

42:45.800 --> 42:47.201
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

42:47.234 --> 42:48.235
Come on.

42:50.337 --> 42:52.273
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

42:52.306 --> 42:53.707
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:53.741 --> 42:55.009
Where you been?

42:55.042 --> 42:58.245
- Oh, you know, just, uh...
- Just where?

42:58.279 --> 43:00.081
- I...
- I mean, I missed you.

43:00.114 --> 43:02.183
You haven't called me
or texted me or anything.

43:02.216 --> 43:03.384
I mean, I haven't
heard from you.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.352
I'm worried about you,
you know.

43:05.386 --> 43:07.888
Oh, you know,
just busy with, um...

43:07.922 --> 43:09.190
- Hey, you guys.
- What? Shut up.

43:09.223 --> 43:10.991
- Get out of here. What the fuck, Cody?
- I'll be right back.

43:11.826 --> 43:12.860
Bye.

43:14.728 --> 43:15.763
You like it here?

43:18.766 --> 43:19.900
Not much of a talker?

43:22.269 --> 43:23.270
Do you smoke?

43:36.884 --> 43:37.885
Want some?

43:38.719 --> 43:39.787
It's just weed.

45:03.003 --> 45:04.305
Hey, darling,
can I get a shot, please?

45:14.048 --> 45:15.049
Thank you.

45:22.957 --> 45:25.359
- We gotta go back for Trey.
- He'll be fine.

45:25.392 --> 45:26.595
Fuck that.

45:26.628 --> 45:29.063
- We gotta go back for him.
- There's too many fucking cops.

45:29.096 --> 45:30.064
- Don't you fucking get it?
- But...

45:30.097 --> 45:31.899
I'm not fucking
going back there, all right?

45:31.932 --> 45:34.201
Trey's a big boy.
He'll find his own way home.

46:05.032 --> 46:06.100
We should really go back.

46:10.137 --> 46:11.138
No.

46:18.312 --> 46:20.080
You know what
we should really do?

46:22.082 --> 46:23.450
Have a drink together.

46:24.084 --> 46:26.453
- I'm good.
- You're good?

46:29.423 --> 46:30.424
You're not good.

46:31.892 --> 46:33.193
Stop being such a pussy.

46:34.061 --> 46:35.863
I'm not a fucking pussy.

46:38.032 --> 46:39.033
Yeah, you are.

46:40.968 --> 46:41.969
I'm not.

46:42.903 --> 46:44.038
You're a weak...

46:46.340 --> 46:47.341
little pussy.

46:49.310 --> 46:51.945
- Fuck this.
- Hey, hey, hey...

46:51.979 --> 46:53.881
Look at me. Come on.
Have a drink with me.

46:54.616 --> 46:55.816
I'm good.

46:58.419 --> 46:59.420
Cody.

47:01.121 --> 47:02.923
- Yo!
- I said I'm good.

47:53.006 --> 47:54.007
Can I help you?

47:54.475 --> 47:55.943
What's going on?

47:55.976 --> 47:57.177
Area's closed.

47:57.211 --> 47:59.079
I'm just
looking for somebody.

47:59.113 --> 48:00.114
Move on.

48:03.651 --> 48:05.953
Did you hear
what I said, boy? Get.

48:07.187 --> 48:08.222
Get.

48:10.491 --> 48:12.459
Jesus. Stupid fucking kids.

48:16.230 --> 48:17.231
Who was that?

48:18.600 --> 48:20.300
Some dumb kid.

48:20.334 --> 48:22.604
- Take a statement?
- Huh?

48:37.552 --> 48:39.019
Mack.

48:39.052 --> 48:41.221
Fuck, Cody.

48:43.123 --> 48:44.692
Trey...

48:44.726 --> 48:46.393
What are you talking about?

48:46.427 --> 48:47.494
What're you thinking?

48:47.529 --> 48:49.731
Looks like the bullet
may have ruptured the aorta.

48:49.764 --> 48:51.999
- Single shot?
- Yep.

48:52.032 --> 48:54.134
Straight shot to the chest.

48:54.168 --> 48:55.469
Definitely was
a straight bullet.

48:56.203 --> 48:58.338
Homicide.

48:58.372 --> 49:00.207
That's a fucking
execution, detective.

49:01.141 --> 49:02.443
- Any ID?
- No.

49:02.476 --> 49:04.077
- Thanks.
- Absolutely.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.145
- Thanks, Russ.
- Thanks.

49:06.079 --> 49:08.015
- Okay.
- Anything else you need from me?

49:08.048 --> 49:09.183
Give that to you.

49:10.050 --> 49:11.485
All right.

49:11.519 --> 49:13.253
Hey, Ellis.
I think the family's here.

49:21.228 --> 49:22.530
Can I help you?

49:22.564 --> 49:23.731
I'm looking for my son.

49:24.566 --> 49:25.600
I'm sorry. You're...

49:26.568 --> 49:27.968
My son Trey.

49:28.435 --> 49:30.237
His name's Trey?

49:30.270 --> 49:31.405
Trey Watkins.

49:32.339 --> 49:34.408
And you're his father?

49:34.441 --> 49:36.711
- We just covered that.
- And your name is?

49:36.744 --> 49:38.111
Do you know where he is?

49:39.446 --> 49:42.483
Sir, I can't give you that information.
I need your name, please.

49:44.519 --> 49:46.754
If you have seen my son,
tell me where he is.

49:46.788 --> 49:50.023
Sir, please, stay calm.
Can you identify this boy?

49:53.260 --> 49:54.261
Is that your son?

50:02.336 --> 50:03.337
It's him.

50:03.370 --> 50:04.873
Okay, so we're classifying
this as a homicide.

50:04.906 --> 50:07.241
- I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions.
- This is a fucking homicide.

50:07.274 --> 50:08.275
What else would it be?

50:08.743 --> 50:10.244
Where is his body?

50:10.277 --> 50:12.079
This is an open investigation.

50:12.112 --> 50:13.781
- I can't give you that kind of information.
- Fuck this.

50:13.815 --> 50:15.315
Sir.

50:15.349 --> 50:19.621
Sir, we're going to need you to identify
him at the coroner's office. Hey!

50:23.691 --> 50:25.392
<i>How the hell
did you get here?</i>

50:25.425 --> 50:26.594
<i>And I want to know
what happened to Trey.</i>

50:27.829 --> 50:29.196
What do you mean?

50:29.229 --> 50:32.399
- Weren't you with him?
- I was. But...

50:32.432 --> 50:36.771
he left with some girls.
I saw cops, so I ran.

50:36.804 --> 50:38.673
Oh, honey, take a look
at me in the eyes...

50:39.841 --> 50:41.174
and say it again.

50:42.844 --> 50:46.748
I was with him
and he left with some girls.

50:46.781 --> 50:49.617
I saw cops, so I ran.

50:54.221 --> 50:55.823
Why? What happened?

50:56.558 --> 50:57.559
He's dead.

51:43.905 --> 51:45.105
Be right back.

51:52.714 --> 51:53.848
Daisy,
you want to come up?

52:12.667 --> 52:14.234
Okay.

52:21.341 --> 52:23.176
- No.
- Shut up!

52:24.812 --> 52:25.913
No!

52:26.814 --> 52:27.849
Shut up.

52:42.462 --> 52:44.398
Give me that ass.

53:18.032 --> 53:20.367
- This is how you break a fucking...
- You piece of shit!

53:24.005 --> 53:25.873
- I got you. Hang on.
- What happened?

53:26.574 --> 53:27.575
You okay?

53:29.977 --> 53:32.880
You all get the fuck out of here
before this piece of shit wakes up.

53:51.866 --> 53:54.434
Yeah. Really?

53:54.468 --> 53:55.803
Yeah. Thanks, Kenny. I owe you.

53:57.572 --> 53:58.673
Okay. Consider it done.

54:09.349 --> 54:11.586
- Detective Ellis.
- Yeah.

54:11.619 --> 54:14.354
Hi. My name is Lisa
from Child Services.

54:15.823 --> 54:16.991
We spoke earlier.

54:17.024 --> 54:18.659
Yeah, I'm really sorry.
I gotta run.

54:18.693 --> 54:20.762
It's really important.
I just have a moment.

54:20.795 --> 54:22.597
- I'm sorry.
- Please.

54:25.867 --> 54:28.301
- What is this?
- It's about the fire.

54:32.573 --> 54:33.574
Ellis.

54:36.110 --> 54:37.310
Where?

54:39.046 --> 54:42.650
Yeah. I think I know where that is.
Um, off of 491, right?

54:43.818 --> 54:44.819
Got it.

56:11.639 --> 56:12.740
What do you want to do?

56:15.543 --> 56:16.611
Goddamn it.

56:20.681 --> 56:21.682
Get him up.

56:22.617 --> 56:23.651
Bring him outside.

56:35.997 --> 56:36.998
Yo!

56:39.233 --> 56:40.433
Yo!

56:47.141 --> 56:48.142
Fuck.

56:50.912 --> 56:54.515
Well, I guess we need to come to some sort
of understanding about this piece of shit.

56:54.548 --> 56:56.884
As far as I'm concerned,
you're doing the world a favor.

56:59.053 --> 57:01.055
What are you thinking?

57:01.088 --> 57:03.456
Thinking I got my truck
parked around back.

57:03.490 --> 57:06.060
Load these horses up on my rig
and get on the road.

57:06.093 --> 57:07.728
Never see or hear
from me again.

57:12.533 --> 57:13.534
Okay, then.

57:24.045 --> 57:26.681
Fuck you!

57:37.658 --> 57:38.960
Damn! Get in here!

58:54.702 --> 58:55.736
Praise Jesus.

58:58.239 --> 58:59.840
You know how
to crack a safe?

59:00.775 --> 59:02.943
Fuck no, I don't know
how to crack a safe.

59:09.116 --> 59:10.918
But I know how to open one.

59:19.393 --> 59:21.162
Goddamn it.

59:23.798 --> 59:26.033
What you got, Mack?

59:30.704 --> 59:31.705
Empty.

59:33.274 --> 59:35.042
Is that one of them
Faberle eggs?

59:36.777 --> 59:38.679
<i>Faberge,</i> you idiot.

59:38.712 --> 59:40.748
<i>Faberge.</i> Faberle...

59:40.781 --> 59:42.349
All I know is they're worth,
like, 80 grand.

59:42.883 --> 59:43.951
What?

59:45.152 --> 59:46.654
The fuck you talking about?

59:57.965 --> 59:58.966
Eighty grand.

1:01:09.036 --> 1:01:10.037
Hey, Captain.

1:01:11.205 --> 1:01:12.773
Don't "Hey, Captain" me.

1:01:12.806 --> 1:01:14.241
What in the hell
are we doing here, Ellis?

1:01:14.275 --> 1:01:15.510
Sir, we have reason to believe

1:01:15.544 --> 1:01:16.944
the owner of this property Mack Monroe...

1:01:16.977 --> 1:01:20.481
...has something to do with the
death of the kid we found in the pit.

1:01:20.515 --> 1:01:22.082
- Also, we think that...
- Mm-hm.

1:01:23.317 --> 1:01:25.152
Okay, got it.

1:01:25.186 --> 1:01:26.320
We've got a deed
on the property,

1:01:26.353 --> 1:01:28.155
it's owned
by Fred and Gloria Worley.

1:01:28.189 --> 1:01:29.723
- Worley?
- Detective Ellis.

1:01:29.757 --> 1:01:31.458
- Yeah.
- We've got a weapon over here.

1:01:52.279 --> 1:01:53.847
This is what
I was talking about.

1:01:55.916 --> 1:01:58.819
This is how
we're supposed to be living.

1:02:01.222 --> 1:02:02.756
Yes, it is.

1:02:07.127 --> 1:02:11.131
Look at this one...
always on her fucking phone.

1:02:14.168 --> 1:02:15.769
You're drunk.

1:02:15.803 --> 1:02:16.904
That's right, I'm drunk.

1:02:19.541 --> 1:02:23.444
I'm drunk on...
upward mobility.

1:02:39.193 --> 1:02:40.995
The Holy Spirit is among us.

1:02:41.596 --> 1:02:42.863
You feel that?

1:02:43.330 --> 1:02:44.398
I do.

1:02:50.137 --> 1:02:51.205
How about you, girl?

1:02:54.375 --> 1:02:55.442
You feel it?

1:02:57.878 --> 1:02:59.480
Yeah, I feel it.

1:03:00.981 --> 1:03:02.049
It feels good.

1:03:08.455 --> 1:03:09.524
Mm.

1:03:10.525 --> 1:03:11.992
Give me the fucking phone.

1:03:14.862 --> 1:03:16.497
I said give me
the fucking phone!

1:03:16.531 --> 1:03:19.266
- Mack! Mack!
- Fucking... You fucking...

1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:21.101
Mack!

1:03:21.135 --> 1:03:22.936
The cops are all
over the property.

1:03:25.172 --> 1:03:26.173
Okay.

1:03:39.621 --> 1:03:40.888
Okay, then.

1:03:42.356 --> 1:03:44.526
I didn't like that
place anyhow.

1:03:44.559 --> 1:03:46.927
Okay, so over
here is the family

1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:48.162
that was killed in that fire.

1:03:48.195 --> 1:03:50.598
Thomas King
was shot prior to the fire

1:03:50.632 --> 1:03:52.066
while his wife and child

1:03:52.099 --> 1:03:53.535
burned alive during
their sleep.

1:03:53.568 --> 1:03:56.470
- The mother of the kid?
- They were foster parents.

1:03:56.503 --> 1:03:58.272
Apparently, they fostered kids
to earn extra money

1:03:58.305 --> 1:04:00.174
and did God knows what else.

1:04:00.207 --> 1:04:02.876
This is Mack Monroe, ex-Marine.

1:04:02.910 --> 1:04:04.111
One hell of a rap sheet.

1:04:06.046 --> 1:04:07.281
Who are these people?

1:04:07.314 --> 1:04:09.216
The Worley's.
Retirees in their 70s.

1:04:09.249 --> 1:04:12.052
They're the ones who bought
the plot of land 12 years ago.

1:04:12.086 --> 1:04:14.488
They haven't been seen or heard
of in over a year and a half.

1:04:14.522 --> 1:04:16.890
Over here
is the entire Monroe gang.

1:04:16.924 --> 1:04:19.460
A bunch of river rats taken
in by Mr. Monroe, I'm told,

1:04:19.493 --> 1:04:20.894
that are living
on the Worley property.

1:04:20.928 --> 1:04:22.530
I have a K9 unit
over there right now.

1:04:25.065 --> 1:04:26.166
Who's this?

1:04:27.368 --> 1:04:28.435
This is one
of the foster kids

1:04:28.469 --> 1:04:29.537
from the house that
burned down.

1:04:29.571 --> 1:04:30.904
<i>She's unaccounted for.</i>

1:06:13.140 --> 1:06:14.341
<i>Jesus Christ...</i>

1:06:17.612 --> 1:06:19.446
our Lord and savior.

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:22.650
We thank you for these gifts
as well as for our family.

1:06:25.052 --> 1:06:30.357
Even though one of our own
is now by your side,

1:06:31.793 --> 1:06:33.761
we trust that
you will protect him.

1:06:33.795 --> 1:06:36.029
Please pardon our sins

1:06:36.063 --> 1:06:39.333
and forgive us our mercy
so that we may use them

1:06:39.366 --> 1:06:42.169
<i>and allow us to eat and drink
in your name. Amen.</i>

1:06:42.202 --> 1:06:45.072
- You mess with guns a lot?
- Yeah.

1:06:47.374 --> 1:06:49.076
Have you killed anyone?

1:06:49.109 --> 1:06:50.612
Yeah. Many a people.

1:06:52.246 --> 1:06:54.314
You know that trailer
that burnt down?

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:58.151
I shot that whole place up.

1:06:58.185 --> 1:06:59.687
I shot it up, burnt it down.

1:07:02.489 --> 1:07:03.558
Like that?

1:07:11.465 --> 1:07:13.233
I'm about to go get us paid.

1:07:16.103 --> 1:07:17.170
Cyrus...

1:07:17.805 --> 1:07:19.072
you're in charge.

1:07:38.826 --> 1:07:40.060
Clean this shit up.

1:07:54.776 --> 1:07:56.109
I didn't stutter, did I?

1:07:59.647 --> 1:08:00.748
Clean the shit up.

1:08:00.782 --> 1:08:02.349
Fuck you!

1:08:03.250 --> 1:08:04.251
Lexy.

1:08:07.254 --> 1:08:08.856
Lexy! I said...

1:08:37.685 --> 1:08:38.853
Ricky!

1:08:40.622 --> 1:08:41.689
Ricky!

1:08:41.723 --> 1:08:42.890
Mack.

1:08:42.924 --> 1:08:45.292
No, no, no, no, no, Mack.

1:08:45.325 --> 1:08:47.762
- No, no, I got something. I got...
- No, no Mack.

1:08:47.795 --> 1:08:49.463
- Buddy, I'm not gonna rob you.
- No, no.

1:08:49.496 --> 1:08:52.466
I'm not going to rob you.
Just look at this, fuck's sake.

1:08:52.499 --> 1:08:54.434
- You've been nothing but trouble.
- All right.

1:08:54.468 --> 1:08:56.638
- Nothing but trouble.
- Well, feast your eyes on that.

1:08:58.906 --> 1:09:00.842
Oh, shit.

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:03.143
- Holy cats.
- Right?

1:09:13.955 --> 1:09:15.389
So?

1:09:15.422 --> 1:09:16.490
One second.

1:09:22.664 --> 1:09:23.731
Ricky.

1:09:30.237 --> 1:09:31.639
What?

1:09:31.673 --> 1:09:33.373
I'm sorry, Mack.

1:09:34.274 --> 1:09:35.409
But why?

1:09:36.410 --> 1:09:37.411
That ain't real.

1:09:38.780 --> 1:09:40.548
Say it again.

1:09:40.581 --> 1:09:42.917
It's just cut glass
and brass.

1:09:43.316 --> 1:09:44.686
It's a fake.

1:09:57.665 --> 1:09:58.733
It's cool.

1:09:59.801 --> 1:10:00.868
It's cool.

1:10:02.335 --> 1:10:03.538
Well, shit, old buddy.

1:10:06.007 --> 1:10:07.575
Guess I am gonna rob you.

1:10:18.285 --> 1:10:19.587
Cody, I need
to tell you something.

1:10:20.521 --> 1:10:22.255
You wanna get out of here?

1:10:22.289 --> 1:10:24.491
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1:10:24.926 --> 1:10:25.993
We all can.

1:10:28.763 --> 1:10:31.331
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

1:10:32.066 --> 1:10:33.601
We'll all just go somewhere.

1:10:34.035 --> 1:10:36.003
You, me...

1:10:36.838 --> 1:10:38.238
Lexy.

1:10:38.740 --> 1:10:39.807
We are the same.

1:10:42.610 --> 1:10:43.745
We're not the same.

1:10:45.046 --> 1:10:46.279
What do you mean?

1:10:46.313 --> 1:10:48.015
The people I was
staying with were.

1:11:03.564 --> 1:11:05.666
You were saying?

1:11:05.700 --> 1:11:08.536
Never mind, I'm tired.
I'm gonna go to bed.

1:12:00.655 --> 1:12:02.723
Look, she's already
been missing for 48 hours.

1:12:02.757 --> 1:12:04.091
We've reached out to
the surrounding counties.

1:12:04.125 --> 1:12:05.827
That's all we can do
at this time.

1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:07.327
We'll ghost the Monroe gang.

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:10.965
We'd put a APB out first thing but I
have a feeling they're already gone.

1:12:10.998 --> 1:12:12.432
- Detective?
- Yeah.

1:12:12.465 --> 1:12:13.901
- Someone's asking for you.
- Who?

1:12:13.935 --> 1:12:16.704
I don't know. Some girl.
She says she knows you.

1:12:16.737 --> 1:12:19.073
Okay. I'll be right back.

1:12:47.568 --> 1:12:48.603
Fallen.

1:12:55.943 --> 1:12:57.545
My joy.

1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:02.049
Take my soul.

1:13:37.251 --> 1:13:40.688
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let me see. Let me see. Hey.

1:13:40.721 --> 1:13:42.422
How bad is it? Hey, hey, hey.

1:14:39.280 --> 1:14:41.248
Cody, now.

1:14:41.282 --> 1:14:43.117
Get the fuck up, we gotta go!

1:15:14.882 --> 1:15:16.283
Cy, what the fuck?

1:15:19.220 --> 1:15:20.855
No, no.

1:15:20.888 --> 1:15:23.624
Help! No! No.

1:15:23.657 --> 1:15:25.126
What the fuck did you do?

1:15:27.361 --> 1:15:29.096
No!

1:15:29.997 --> 1:15:31.132
What the fuck?

1:15:31.932 --> 1:15:33.067
Goddamn it!

1:16:25.853 --> 1:16:26.987
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

1:16:28.489 --> 1:16:33.227
<i>It's funny how quick we are to
praise God when good things happen.</i>

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:35.729
<i>But when the bottom falls out
and the dream dissipates</i>

1:16:35.763 --> 1:16:37.698
<i>to nothing more
than an afterthought...</i>

1:16:39.033 --> 1:16:40.367
<i>we never blame Him.</i>

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:45.206
<i>We don't curse God for all
the misfortune and pain.</i>

1:16:45.239 --> 1:16:47.041
<i>For that, we blame ourselves.</i>

1:16:48.943 --> 1:16:51.846
<i>I always thought the good life
was there for the taking.</i>

1:16:52.780 --> 1:16:54.715
<i>Manifest destiny.</i>

1:16:54.748 --> 1:16:56.083
<i>Rugged individualism.</i>

1:16:57.751 --> 1:17:00.187
<i>But maybe you die
the exact same way you lived...</i>

1:17:01.355 --> 1:17:02.823
<i>inside the margins.</i>

1:17:05.192 --> 1:17:07.094
<i>Most of us will never make it.</i>

1:17:08.329 --> 1:17:10.264
<i>But if you do find
your way out...</i>

1:17:10.297 --> 1:17:14.835
<i>out the muck and marsh,
the mud and the gators...</i>

1:17:14.869 --> 1:17:18.939
<i>and you find you still have a sliver of
hope and any will left inside your body...</i>

1:17:20.841 --> 1:17:22.943
<i>may you rise like a phoenix
from the ashes,</i>

1:17:24.378 --> 1:17:26.180
<i>somewhere far away from them.</i>

1:17:26.213 --> 1:17:27.848
Get down on the ground.

1:17:28.782 --> 1:17:29.950
Drop your weapon.

1:17:31.719 --> 1:17:33.220
Hold your fire,
hold your fire.
