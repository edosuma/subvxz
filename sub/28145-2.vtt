WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:04.860
As you all know, at the beginning
of term, the bishop graciously

00:04.900 --> 00:07.700
bestowed a beautiful
piece of religious art

00:07.740 --> 00:10.540
onto our lady immaculate college

00:10.580 --> 00:13.260
the enchanting child of Prague.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.820
Music: Jazzie's groove
by soul ii soul

00:22.620 --> 00:24.140
there we are.

00:24.180 --> 00:25.940
Sure, isn't he
a great fella altogether?

00:25.980 --> 00:27.900
I still don't get what
it's supposed to be.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.100
It's Jesus as a wain.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.660
Why has he got a big red hat on?

00:31.700 --> 00:32.700
Nobody knows.

00:32.740 --> 00:33.980
It was the bishop's wish that

00:34.020 --> 00:36.500
he be passed around all
the schools in the derry diocese.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.180
Therefore we are joined this morning

00:38.220 --> 00:40.140
by mr Malone,
headmaster of st Benedict's,

00:40.180 --> 00:42.300
so that the handover ceremony
can take place.

00:42.340 --> 00:44.380
You're very welcome, mr Malone.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.500
Though I fear you may have had
a wasted journey.

00:47.540 --> 00:51.140
I've thought about it,
and I'd much rather

00:51.180 --> 00:53.820
just hold on to him, actually.

00:53.860 --> 00:55.700
He brightens up my office.

00:55.740 --> 00:57.780
He doesn't answer back.

00:58.980 --> 01:00.460
I like the fella.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.140
And if the bishop has a problem with
that, he can take it up with me.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.860
Now, what else was there?

01:07.060 --> 01:08.260
Yes.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.500
Sadly, sister Patrick
has decided to leave us.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.660
She's returning to
her missionary work,

01:14.700 --> 01:19.780
educating the heathen inhabitants
of a primitive and savage place.

01:19.820 --> 01:22.340
She's...Taken a teaching
post in belfast, sister.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.580
Precisely.

01:23.620 --> 01:25.260
The board of governors promised me

01:25.300 --> 01:27.300
that her replacement
would arrive today,

01:27.340 --> 01:30.380
but as usual
they were talking out of their...

01:30.420 --> 01:31.007
Door bangs

01:31.740 --> 01:33.940
music: I can't be with you
by the Cranberries

01:35.700 --> 01:37.500
I believe you've been expecting me.

01:40.580 --> 01:41.900
Here we go.

01:44.820 --> 01:47.780
Lying in my bed again

01:47.820 --> 01:50.780
and I cry cos you're not here...

01:54.420 --> 01:55.780
Chalk pings and clatters

01:58.860 --> 01:59.860
she sighs

02:05.860 --> 02:08.740
what is it we should be doing, miss?

02:08.780 --> 02:10.539
"What should you be doing?"

02:12.420 --> 02:14.940
Now, there's the question.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.220
But let me ask you a better one.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.220
What is it you want to do?

02:21.260 --> 02:22.740
Get pished.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.540
I'd quite like some feedback on
the poetry assignment, actually.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.860
Dickhead.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.180
It counts towards our
final grade, people!

02:29.220 --> 02:31.140
This is 12a, right?

02:31.180 --> 02:32.380
That is correct, miss.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.740
And you are? Jenny. Jenny Joyce.

02:36.260 --> 02:37.420
Here we go.

02:37.460 --> 02:39.620
The flower, by Jenny Joyce.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.260
You're not going to read it out,
are you? Of course.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.700
Poetry should always be read aloud.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.740
"Some flowers are tall
some flowers are small

02:49.780 --> 02:51.940
"some flowers barely grow at all."

02:53.460 --> 02:55.100
Ok... that's not the end.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.180
It should be.

02:56.220 --> 02:57.780
Here's a poem about a dog.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.500
Here's another one about a dog.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.460
This one has no name on it.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.980
An English rose among thorns?

03:06.340 --> 03:09.860
Yeah, I can see why you might want
to remain anonymous, all right.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.260
Dog poem.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.180
Poem about a tree.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.260
This one's called boys.

03:15.300 --> 03:16.940
"I think boys are really class

03:16.980 --> 03:20.540
"especially the ones
who have a nice ass."

03:20.580 --> 03:21.940
It's called a haiku.

03:21.980 --> 03:23.860
That's not what I would call it.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.180
Dog poem. Dog poem.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.620
Here someone's just
drawn a picture of a dog.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.300
That is not bad, actually.
Thank you very much.

03:33.340 --> 03:37.260
This person has written about how
much they love their English class,

03:37.300 --> 03:40.340
in an embarrassing attempt
to suck up to the teacher.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.220
Dog poem. Dog poem.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.580
Cat poem.

03:44.620 --> 03:45.740
Yes?

03:45.780 --> 03:47.660
I think a lot of people
in this class,

03:47.700 --> 03:49.380
and I know no-one will
mind me saying this,

03:49.420 --> 03:52.780
well, they have a very basic
grasp of the creative process.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.540
Whereas I've been writing for years,
so I'm really not afraid to

03:55.580 --> 03:57.540
put myself out there,

03:57.580 --> 03:59.900
to be bold, to take risks.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.460
And you are?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.420
That's my cousin. Erin Quinn.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.900
Erin Quinn.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.300
Here we go.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.500
"The bullets fired on
the streets as I lie in my bed

04:11.540 --> 04:15.220
"are nothing to
the bullets being fired...

04:15.260 --> 04:16.540
"In my head."

04:16.579 --> 04:19.579
It's about the troubles
in a political sense,

04:19.620 --> 04:23.260
but also about my own troubles,
in a personal sense.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.540
No, I understand the weak analogy.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.380
This isn't bold, Erin.

04:28.420 --> 04:30.340
It's someone failing to be bold.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.780
Well, I'm sorry if the subtleties

04:31.820 --> 04:33.500
of my work were lost on you,
miss de brun.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.340
Poetry is truth.

04:35.380 --> 04:40.660
And great poetry is raw and real
and messy and glorious and ugly.

04:40.700 --> 04:43.100
It is dragged from
the depths of the soul.

04:43.140 --> 04:46.780
It helps us understand
each other and ourselves.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.060
Do you get what I'm saying?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.540
Yes.

04:50.580 --> 04:52.980
Yes, I think I do, actually.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.540
Not a baldies.

04:54.580 --> 04:57.860
It's not often in life
you're allowed to tear up the page

04:57.900 --> 04:59.020
and start over.

05:00.940 --> 05:03.420
But I am gonna give you that chance.

05:05.540 --> 05:06.860
Impress me.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.980
Music: Return to innocence
by enigma

05:15.420 --> 05:16.900
ach, this is lovely, Gerry.

05:16.940 --> 05:19.100
I thought it'd be nice for us
to do something together,

05:19.140 --> 05:20.300
just the two of us, you know?

05:20.340 --> 05:21.820
Mary! Gerry!

05:21.860 --> 05:25.500
You're not allowed to
smoke in this place.

05:25.540 --> 05:28.100
Can you believe that? It's barbaric.

05:28.140 --> 05:30.220
Sarah, what are you doing here?

05:30.260 --> 05:32.340
Mary said you were having
a wee night to yourselves,

05:32.380 --> 05:34.100
so I thought
you might want some company.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.660
Why? W-why would you think that?

05:35.700 --> 05:36.780
Sarah!

05:36.820 --> 05:39.220
Himself as well, is it? Great(!)

05:39.260 --> 05:40.380
Sweet Jesus.

05:40.420 --> 05:42.220
Hiya, how are ye?

05:42.260 --> 05:44.980
They don't let you smoke in here,
ciaran. Can you credit it?

05:45.020 --> 05:46.820
This is a nice surprise.

05:46.860 --> 05:48.460
When Sarah asked me to the cinema,

05:48.500 --> 05:51.140
I thought, well, I thought
she meant just the two of us.

05:51.180 --> 05:55.660
No, ciaran, because that would be...
What's the word now? Normal.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.580
Double date it is, then, so.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.180
Wonder what's keeping daddy.

06:00.980 --> 06:02.900
Excuse me? I've got the tickets.

06:02.940 --> 06:04.940
We haven't decided
what we want to see yet, da!

06:04.980 --> 06:07.660
Well, I liked the look of that one
with all the lads in the line-up.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.780
It's got your man in it,
the farmer from glenroe.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.260
What, Gabriel byrne?

06:11.300 --> 06:13.500
He's done a fair bit
since glenroe now.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.380
Who are you? His agent?

06:15.420 --> 06:18.180
Da, I don't understand this.
You hate the cinema.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.340
Not since I discovered

06:19.380 --> 06:21.460
it's the only way I can spend time
with our colm.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.300
It's the one place
the boring bastard doesn't talk.

06:24.340 --> 06:25.940
But colm's not here, is he, da?

06:27.740 --> 06:29.220
Da?

06:29.260 --> 06:31.980
..And that's not to say, now,
that in my younger years,

06:32.020 --> 06:34.700
I didn't enjoy a boiled sweet.

06:34.740 --> 06:38.060
But then I heard tell
of a fella from ballynahinch...

06:38.100 --> 06:39.940
What was it his name was, now?

06:39.980 --> 06:41.540
I had it there a minute ago.

06:41.580 --> 06:43.020
Ach, it'll come to me.

06:43.060 --> 06:47.580
Anyway, this ballynahinch lad,
and, as I say, his name escapes me,

06:47.620 --> 06:50.260
but he was mad keen on
the boiled sweets.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.940
Sure, he couldn't get
enough of them.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.780
But in the end, well,
didn't he choke to death on one?

06:56.820 --> 07:00.180
A pear drop, I think it was.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.460
Or a clove rock, maybe.

07:01.500 --> 07:04.420
But either way,
it's not how I'd want to go.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.100
I know, love. I know.

07:11.460 --> 07:13.620
Tense string music

Advertise your product or brand here

07:22.060 --> 07:23.540
well, isn't this romantic?

07:23.580 --> 07:25.620
Thon fella's nothing
but a fly bastard!

07:25.660 --> 07:27.060
don't you be trusting him!

07:27.100 --> 07:30.100
I just want to check, does your
father think that they can hear him?

07:30.140 --> 07:31.780
Ssh.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.220
Doors clatter open

07:33.260 --> 07:34.820
apologies, folks.

07:34.860 --> 07:37.340
We've just had
a wee security alert there.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.420
Grumbling

07:38.460 --> 07:41.620
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to carry out a wee evacuation.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.620
So, if you'll all follow me.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.860
Lovely. Great stuff.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.340
That's the last time
i let you organise a night out.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.620
Ok, then.

07:49.660 --> 07:51.420
What about this keyser soze fella?

07:51.460 --> 07:53.220
Who's keyser soze?

07:53.260 --> 07:54.980
Exactly!

07:55.020 --> 07:58.300
Music: don't give me your life
by Alex party

08:01.580 --> 08:04.980
{an5}god, this whole
writing-from-the-soul carry-on
is a nightmare.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.620
I know. What rhymes with ride?

08:06.660 --> 08:07.660
Bide.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.700
Bide? What the fuck does bide mean?
Bide. That's not a word.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.780
It is a word, Michelle.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.620
Bide? You've pure made that up.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.140
Can we all be quiet? Please.

08:15.180 --> 08:16.740
What do you think, James?

08:16.780 --> 08:19.020
You've got red eyes
cos I ran out of brown.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.220
My eyes are green.

08:20.260 --> 08:21.300
Now you tell me.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.180
Ok. So, I'm trying
not to think too much.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.820
Just to sort of
let it flow through me.

08:25.860 --> 08:27.420
That's minging, Erin.

08:27.460 --> 08:28.900
Here's what I have so far.

08:28.940 --> 08:30.340
"You know we belong together

08:30.380 --> 08:31.740
"you and I forever and ever

08:31.780 --> 08:34.179
"no matter where you are
you're my guiding star."

08:34.220 --> 08:36.419
Isn't that the theme tune
to home and away?

08:36.460 --> 08:37.820
Is it?

08:37.860 --> 08:39.539
Aw, for god's sake!

08:39.580 --> 08:40.780
Door opens

08:40.820 --> 08:41.940
shit!

08:41.980 --> 08:44.059
Gerry: My money's on
Alec Baldwin's brother.

08:44.100 --> 08:45.660
Mary: It's Gabriel byrne.
I'm telling you.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.500
Joe: The fella with the bad leg
said it wasn't, Mary.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.980
The fella with the bad leg's
covering for him, da!

08:51.020 --> 08:53.700
Sweet Jesus.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.260
Mouth full: Mammy, we can explain.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.660
Not the Christmas cupboard?

08:56.700 --> 08:58.700
They've had
the very tunnock's, Mary.

08:58.740 --> 08:59.900
Animals, the lot of you!

08:59.940 --> 09:01.460
We needed energy for our poetry.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.500
I'll give you
energy for your poetry!

09:03.540 --> 09:05.980
We were just gonna take
a handful of chocolate money, Mary.

09:06.020 --> 09:07.420
But then one thing led to another.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.020
What am I supposed to do?

09:09.060 --> 09:10.300
I'll have to start from scratch now.

09:10.340 --> 09:11.980
And December's only round
the corner.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.300
It's eight months away, love.

09:13.340 --> 09:15.780
This suits you, doesn't it?
I'm sorry?

09:15.820 --> 09:17.900
I've seen you eyeing up
that Christmas cupboard.

09:17.940 --> 09:20.180
You hoked about in there
long before the wains did.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.740
I'll stake my life on it.

09:21.780 --> 09:24.820
That is simply not true.

09:24.860 --> 09:26.980
Let's just salvage what we can.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.340
There's only a couple
of snowballs left, Mary.

09:29.380 --> 09:31.340
It's been an absolute free-for-all.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.100
Your mothers will be
hearing about this.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.260
Aw, for... what got into you, girls?

09:35.300 --> 09:37.860
You know you don't touch
the Christmas cupboard.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.140
We're stressed!

09:39.180 --> 09:41.500
Our new English teacher made us
rip up all our poems

09:41.540 --> 09:42.860
and re-do them in one night.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.060
Who is this blow-in?

09:44.100 --> 09:45.300
Here name's miss de brun.

09:45.340 --> 09:47.300
She's a bit of a bitch,
but, cracking eyeliner.

09:47.340 --> 09:48.500
Winged or smudged?

09:48.540 --> 09:49.780
Sort of both.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.100
Interesting.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.620
She ripped up your poems?

09:52.660 --> 09:54.180
She said we weren't
writing from the soul.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.900
Well, why in under god
weren't you writing from the soul?

09:56.940 --> 09:58.020
Seriously?

09:59.060 --> 10:01.740
Miss de brun: It was difficult,
so you've just given up?

10:01.780 --> 10:03.900
You might fail,
so why bother trying?

10:03.940 --> 10:04.980
Exactly.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.060
Told you she'd understand.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.460
Have you ever stopped
to look at these?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.700
These faces from the past.

10:15.820 --> 10:18.140
They're not
so different from you, really.

10:18.180 --> 10:21.020
They had dreams like you do.

10:21.060 --> 10:23.540
They had...Ambitions.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.140
But now, they're gone.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.700
Dead.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.420
Dust.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.900
That's my auntie Anne third
from the left. She's not dead.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.460
Ssh! But she's only 54.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.180
She runs the mobile library
in ballymagroarty. Quiet.

10:37.220 --> 10:41.460
But did they fulfil those dreams,
those ambitions?

10:41.500 --> 10:45.980
One day, girls, you too will just be
an old photograph in a hallway.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.660
You only get one life.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.020
don't be afraid to live it.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.740
Find your voice.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.660
Make your mark.

11:01.140 --> 11:03.180
Sometimes

11:03.220 --> 11:07.980
the river flows
but nothing breathes

11:08.020 --> 11:12.020
a train arrives
but never leaves...

11:12.060 --> 11:16.180
Dig deep, something you hate,
something you despise.

11:16.220 --> 11:18.460
No holding back. Come on!

11:18.500 --> 11:19.740
Get it out!

11:20.780 --> 11:23.180
Injustice! Yes!

11:23.220 --> 11:24.500
Prejudice!

11:24.540 --> 11:26.620
Good! This is good!

11:26.660 --> 11:29.620
Of being rich or being poor

11:29.660 --> 11:32.340
such a shame...

11:32.380 --> 11:34.500
Mass! Come on!

11:34.540 --> 11:36.580
My own socks!

11:36.620 --> 11:38.180
Ok.

11:38.220 --> 11:39.980
Being late for school!

11:40.020 --> 11:41.740
Piano lessons!

11:41.780 --> 11:44.140
The fact that people here
use the word "wee"

11:44.180 --> 11:47.460
to describe things that aren't
even actually that small!

11:47.500 --> 11:50.020
God, but I love that accent, James!

11:50.060 --> 11:52.500
Just seek yourself
and you will shine

11:54.020 --> 11:57.700
you've go to search for
the hero inside yourself

11:59.740 --> 12:02.340
search for the secrets you hide

12:04.340 --> 12:07.260
search for
the hero inside yourself

12:09.020 --> 12:11.900
until you find
the key to your life.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.140
I've got the key
I've got the secret...

12:19.180 --> 12:22.060
Miss de brun's amazing.
I've just never met anyone like her.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.300
She's an inspiration. Absolutely.

12:24.340 --> 12:27.300
She really knows how to grab
things by the balls. Yeah!

12:27.340 --> 12:29.220
She's changed my life,
she really has.

12:29.260 --> 12:30.780
She likes my accent.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.740
I'd die for her.
I think I would too, you know.

12:33.780 --> 12:35.780
Me too. Aye. Fuck it. Why not?

12:35.820 --> 12:38.580
Yeah! I mean, obviously, I totally
agree, I'd die for her as well.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.420
But I'm also conscious of the fact

12:40.460 --> 12:42.940
we've only known her,
like, two days. And?

12:42.980 --> 12:45.420
Is it a wee bit weird she's
invited us to her house at night?

12:45.460 --> 12:47.100
What do you mean?
Well, she's a teacher.

12:47.140 --> 12:48.500
She's much more than a teacher.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.460
Yeah. No. Obviously.
I get that. She's great.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.380
But it's just that I have a feeling
it might be, sort of, frowned upon.

12:53.420 --> 12:56.020
God, Clare. You're so conditioned.
What's that supposed to mean?

12:56.060 --> 12:57.620
It means you need to
loosen the fuck up.

12:57.660 --> 12:59.740
I am loose, thank you very much.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.780
Face it, Clare,
you're a craic killer.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.940
I'm not a craic killer.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.420
I am not a craic killer!

13:07.460 --> 13:09.740
Some wine?
No. Actually, I don't...

13:11.220 --> 13:12.460
Cheers.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.620
Hit me again. Ok.

13:19.860 --> 13:21.620
You don't have much stuff.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.420
Everything I own
can fit into a suitcase.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.580
I've never understood why
people weigh themselves down with

13:27.620 --> 13:29.140
meaningless crap, you know?

13:29.180 --> 13:31.220
Yeah. God, I just hate possessions
so much.

13:31.260 --> 13:34.180
Does that mean I can have
your sylvanian family collection?

13:34.220 --> 13:37.780
Shut up, orla. I don't like
to feel tied down, you know.

13:37.820 --> 13:41.780
Life should be spontaneous, free.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.900
Big time.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.660
Slainte.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.540
This is actually nice.
It tastes a bit like blood.

13:47.580 --> 13:50.820
"Life is no brief candle to me.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.980
"It is a sort of splendid torch,

13:53.020 --> 13:57.260
"which I have got hold of for the
moment, and I want to make it burn

13:57.300 --> 13:59.180
"as brightly as possible."

14:00.260 --> 14:01.420
That's beautiful.

14:01.460 --> 14:03.140
Shaw.

14:03.180 --> 14:04.540
It's my favourite quote.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.460
Take it easy, Oliver Reed.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.580
What's yours?

14:07.620 --> 14:10.740
"Be careful, child,
of the doll made of glass.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.420
"For if you hold her too tightly,
she will break, and you will bleed."

14:14.460 --> 14:17.220
I don't think I'm familiar
with that one. Who's it by?

14:17.260 --> 14:19.460
Me. It's by me. Wow!

14:19.500 --> 14:23.140
This is the rhythm
of the night...

14:23.180 --> 14:25.060
I feel all floaty.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.100
She's absolutely fucking flying.

14:27.140 --> 14:30.380
Well, well, well.
What are you guys up to?

14:30.420 --> 14:31.540
Nothing much.

14:31.580 --> 14:33.700
We've just been hanging out
at miss de brun's place.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.540
You were at her house? At night?

14:35.580 --> 14:37.660
Well, that's a bit inappropriate.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.340
Your ma is a bit inappropriate.

14:39.380 --> 14:42.060
That doesn't even make sense.
Your ma doesn't even make sense.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.620
Is she drunk? Your ma's drunk.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.660
Ok, Clare. I think we get the idea.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.820
Lovely seeing you, Jenny.
Take care now.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.660
Radio chatter

14:57.380 --> 15:00.380
I never slept a wink last night,
you know. Me either.

15:00.420 --> 15:02.020
Keyser soze? Naw.

15:02.060 --> 15:04.580
I went to bed with my rollers in.
Sure, it's always a nightmare.

15:04.620 --> 15:07.260
Then why do you do it?
I've no volume at the root, Mary.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.340
What choice do I have?

15:08.380 --> 15:10.260
I'm leaning towards
Pete postlethwaite now.

15:10.300 --> 15:13.020
It wasn't Pete postlethwaite, da.
It's never Pete postlethwaite.

15:13.060 --> 15:14.740
Look, this is
driving me to distraction.

15:14.780 --> 15:15.980
We'll have to go back tonight.

15:16.020 --> 15:17.780
It's not in the listings any more.
What?

15:17.820 --> 15:19.940
The cinema's stopped showing it.
Well done.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.180
It's not my fault.
Sure, nothing ever is.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.700
What are we meant to do? Wait for
them to release it on video.

15:24.740 --> 15:27.700
I can't, Gerry!
I can't go on like this!

15:27.740 --> 15:28.860
I need to know!

15:28.900 --> 15:30.020
Well, that's us away.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.380
Where's your socks, love?
They're just not for me, mammy.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.500
I'm sorry. You'll be foundered.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.300
I know what I'm doing.
Have a great day, everyone.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.860
What are you in
such a good mood about?

15:39.900 --> 15:42.020
Just, you know, life.

15:42.060 --> 15:45.260
You're up to something.
And I'll get to the bottom of it.

15:45.300 --> 15:49.180
Honest to god, Erin - between you
and keyser soze, my head is turned.

15:49.220 --> 15:50.380
Who's keyser soze?

15:50.420 --> 15:51.740
God almighty!

15:56.460 --> 15:58.220
Take a seat, please, ladies.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.340
Where's miss de brun? Gone.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.500
And she's not coming back. What?

16:03.540 --> 16:05.620
I knew it. When I woke up
this morning, I had a feeling

16:05.660 --> 16:08.340
something terrible was going to
happen and also that essentially

16:08.380 --> 16:09.860
deep down, I'm quite an evil person.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.220
It's called a hangover, Clare.
You'll be grand.

16:12.260 --> 16:15.140
I will be taking this class
for the rest of the term,

16:15.180 --> 16:17.900
which makes me want to pull off
my own face, but needs must.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.420
This was you, wasn't it?

16:19.460 --> 16:21.540
What did you do? What did you say?

16:21.580 --> 16:23.300
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:23.340 --> 16:24.700
Aye, so you don't. Supergrass!

16:24.740 --> 16:27.420
That's quite enough.
You don't understand, sister.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.180
Miss de brun, she touched us.

16:30.220 --> 16:33.180
What? She made us think,
she made us feel.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.300
Thank god.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.300
That would be all I need.
You can't sack her! You just can't!

16:38.340 --> 16:42.780
Miss Quinn, you appear to be
under the misapprehension

16:42.820 --> 16:45.940
that you can address me
as though you are my equal.

16:45.980 --> 16:48.460
I suggest you rein it in
and take a seat.

16:52.180 --> 16:53.900
School bell rings

16:56.900 --> 16:58.060
what if she's in there?

16:58.100 --> 17:00.660
It's Friday. She's at judo.
Relax the kecks, Clare.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.300
Creepy wee fucker, isn't he?

17:10.339 --> 17:12.900
I would just like to just state
once again for the record

17:12.940 --> 17:15.540
that I think this might be
the worst idea we've ever had.

17:15.579 --> 17:17.380
Look, do you want to help
miss de brun or not?

17:17.420 --> 17:18.619
Can we not find a way to help her

17:18.660 --> 17:20.619
that doesn't involve
abducting a holy statue?

17:20.660 --> 17:23.579
We're not abducting him, Clare -
we're kidnapping him.

17:23.619 --> 17:25.819
Is that different?
I don't think that's different.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.300
We'll give him back on the condition

17:27.339 --> 17:29.140
that miss de brun
is rightfully reinstated.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.580
I'm sure sister Michael
will be fully on board with that.

17:31.620 --> 17:33.300
Aye, me too.
Ok, let's do the photograph.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.140
Great. I'll write the ransom note.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.700
We need a copy of today's newspaper.
Why?

17:37.740 --> 17:40.780
It's just the done thing,
kidnapping-wise.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.700
I've got last week's
parish bulletin. That'll do.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.020
I'm going to use my left hand,

17:45.060 --> 17:47.060
just in case she recognises
my handwriting.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.100
Well, this is foolproof!

17:49.140 --> 17:51.900
Should I start,
"dear sister Michael,"

17:51.940 --> 17:54.860
or "to whom it may concern,"
do you think?

17:54.900 --> 17:57.660
I don't know about this one.
I think he looks a bit fat in it.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.180
Yeah, that's not flattering. Aye.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.900
Maybe if we just tilt him
this way a bit...

18:01.940 --> 18:03.780
See, I think he needs to
come forward a bit.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.100
It was fine where it was, dicko.

18:05.140 --> 18:08.060
Look, I'm the one taking the photo.
Fuck off! Just leave it, Michelle.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.740
Smashing

18:09.780 --> 18:12.220
good god.

18:14.420 --> 18:18.460
Ok, so we've gone
a bit off course here.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.180
Let's glue him! Brilliant.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.660
We'll just...
We'll just stick it back on.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.740
We'll stick it back on,
and it'll all be grand.

18:28.060 --> 18:30.260
Excited chatter

18:30.300 --> 18:32.500
Jesus, girls!
What are you still doing here?

18:32.540 --> 18:33.940
I thought we had an intruder.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.900
And I tell you what -
he'd have been a sorry boy,

18:36.940 --> 18:39.420
for I just nailed
some serious moves.

18:42.260 --> 18:45.140
We were just working on
our English project, sister.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.500
Step aside.

18:49.620 --> 18:50.820
She snaps her fingers

19:00.660 --> 19:02.780
what in god's name have you done?

19:02.820 --> 19:03.980
Camera whirs

19:05.340 --> 19:08.100
how could you have glued his head on
upside down, orla?

19:08.140 --> 19:11.180
He's wearing a hat,
for Christ's sake! Quiet!

19:11.220 --> 19:12.940
All right, Mary, Sarah, deidre.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.140
Your girls involved in
this beheading too, then?

19:15.180 --> 19:18.300
It wasn't me, mammy!
Do not speak to me, Clare.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.780
In fact, don't even breathe.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.820
Take a seat, mrs devlin.

19:25.660 --> 19:29.340
The statue was
stolen from this room,

19:29.380 --> 19:31.860
so I've asked miss mooney
to photograph the scene.

19:31.900 --> 19:36.220
Either it is replaced, at your
expense, or the school will sue.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.580
To be honest, sister,

19:37.620 --> 19:40.980
and I'm not just saying this -

19:41.020 --> 19:42.620
I think he looks better.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.700
He looks like
his head's on upside down.

19:45.820 --> 19:48.980
And I'll be suspending them
for a week. Please, god! No!

19:49.020 --> 19:51.460
A week? We're going to be stuck
with them for a week?

19:51.500 --> 19:53.700
Be reasonable, sister!
We didn't behead the fella.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.380
By Christ, you're in for it, Erin.
It was an accident, mammy.

19:56.420 --> 19:58.980
So you accidentally wrote
a ransom note, did you?

19:59.020 --> 20:00.980
Ok, that bit wasn't an accident.

20:01.020 --> 20:04.020
But we were so upset by
what happened to miss de brun.

20:04.060 --> 20:06.220
It was wrong.
She shouldn't have been sacked.

20:06.260 --> 20:07.620
She wasn't. What?

20:07.660 --> 20:09.700
Knock on door

20:09.740 --> 20:10.980
sorry to interrupt, sister.

20:11.020 --> 20:14.700
But if I could just grab the old
p45, then I'll be out of your way.

20:14.740 --> 20:15.980
Excuse me?

20:16.020 --> 20:18.620
Miss de brun has
decided to leave us.

20:18.660 --> 20:21.100
I got offered a post
in st Dominic's girls.

20:21.140 --> 20:24.700
Better wages, holiday pay,
great pension - the works.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.140
I couldn't say no, really.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.700
But what happened to
living for the moment?

20:28.740 --> 20:31.020
What happened to
"life should be spontaneous"?

20:31.060 --> 20:32.900
Yeah, I know,
but I'm buying a house

20:32.940 --> 20:35.500
and the mortgage rates are
absolutely crippling at the minute.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.180
Tell me about it. Desperate.

20:37.220 --> 20:40.460
Part of the reason
i became a nun - free accommodation.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.180
But, miss de brun, you inspired me
to do my greatest work.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.460
I see. Which was?

20:46.500 --> 20:49.260
My poem. My glass doll poem.
She's a doll made of glass.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.300
She's a glass doll.
I read it to you last night.

20:51.340 --> 20:53.940
Yeah. I wasn't really
listening, to be honest.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.740
Cheers.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.700
Carpe diem.

21:00.940 --> 21:02.620
Carpe dickhead.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.060
Well, I guess we never knew
who the real miss de brun was.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.260
A bit like keyser soze.

21:08.300 --> 21:09.900
The fella with the bad leg.

21:09.940 --> 21:11.860
What? Keyser soze.

21:12.860 --> 21:14.620
He was the fella with the bad leg.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.580
He was talking
absolute shite the whole time.

21:16.620 --> 21:20.700
He was one of those...Er, what do
you call it? Unreliable narrators.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.580
That's very clever.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.780
Yeah. I thought so, too.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.380
Look this way, girls.

21:33.140 --> 21:35.540
Here we go again

21:35.580 --> 21:38.260
here we go-go-go
to the temple of consumption

21:38.300 --> 21:39.940
get your gear and start to spend

21:39.980 --> 21:42.540
here we go-go-go
with a total dedication

21:42.580 --> 21:44.620
here we go again

21:44.660 --> 21:47.060
here we go-go-go
to the temple of consumption

21:47.100 --> 21:49.300
get your gear and start to spend

21:49.340 --> 21:52.460
here we go,
here we go, here we go.

21:56.260 --> 21:58.540
As some sort of prototype
i serve to be

21:58.580 --> 22:01.100
you see, tomorrow's dream
has never been part of me...
