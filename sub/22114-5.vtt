WEBVTT

00:09.803 --> 00:11.886
( theme music playing )

00:19.220 --> 00:21.053
Oh, shoot.
Here we go.

00:21.053 --> 00:23.886
- Good morning, Mr. David.
- Good morning, Sal.

00:23.886 --> 00:25.637
- What a great day
for golf, huh?
- Yeah.

00:25.637 --> 00:27.886
And it's happening,
Mr. David.

00:27.886 --> 00:29.803
- Oh, yeah?
- It's happening.

00:29.803 --> 00:32.220
- Oh.
- Right over
at Will Rogers Park.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.220
There's going to be
a reenactment

00:34.220 --> 00:35.720
of the Revolutionary War,

00:35.720 --> 00:37.761
which I partake in
every year.

00:37.761 --> 00:40.345
You would not believe
some of the people they have.

00:40.345 --> 00:42.011
- No kidding, yeah.
- I'm going to be a redcoat.

00:42.011 --> 00:44.220
Interesting.
You're going to be
in the British army?

00:44.220 --> 00:46.011
I don't have
a great British accent,

00:46.011 --> 00:48.137
- but tell me if you think
this one works.
- Yeah. Okay.

00:48.137 --> 00:49.803
I'm thinking
of two different kinds.

00:49.803 --> 00:51.387
Tell me which one
you like better.

00:51.387 --> 00:53.554
"Oi, is that--
move that gun over here.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.595
- And get ready.
We're going."
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:55.595 --> 00:57.595
- That's kind of a-- a Cockney.
- That's Cockney, yeah.

00:57.595 --> 00:59.262
But I don't know
if that's what they do.

00:59.262 --> 01:01.761
I think, more often,
it's a-- they...

01:01.761 --> 01:04.886
"Gentlemen, strike
the flagstaff deep,
Sir Knight."

01:04.886 --> 01:06.595
( stammering )
Well, they're both
pretty good.

01:06.595 --> 01:09.595
They're good,
so I-- it's gonna be
a remarkable day for me.

01:09.595 --> 01:12.761
Get in there
and play some great golf
today, okay, Mr. David?

01:12.761 --> 01:15.095
Oh, sir, you may find
the main lot full.

01:15.095 --> 01:17.303
- Okay.
- Okay?
You may find it full.

01:17.303 --> 01:19.053
- You can--
- I got it, yeah.

01:19.053 --> 01:20.679
( muffled )
You can-- if you like,

01:20.679 --> 01:22.554
you can just take--
make a right over here.

01:22.554 --> 01:24.053
Right turn, got it.

01:24.053 --> 01:25.761
- Okay, yeah.
- Go to the bottom
of the hill.

01:25.761 --> 01:28.845
- I think
you'll find some open.
- Okay, yeah.

01:28.845 --> 01:30.053
Have a great day.

01:30.053 --> 01:32.595
Fairways and greens,
Mr. David. Don't forget.

01:34.387 --> 01:36.137
Larry:
So, every time I come in,

01:36.137 --> 01:38.303
it's a whole conversation.

01:38.303 --> 01:41.512
The worst mistake I ever made
was rolling down that window,
just to be nice!

01:41.512 --> 01:44.303
And it's been going on
for months and months.

01:44.303 --> 01:47.220
And now,
I'm in this cycle
that never ends.

01:47.220 --> 01:50.262
Once the window goes down,
it cannot go back up.

01:50.262 --> 01:51.637
- Richard: That's right.
- You are stuck.

01:51.637 --> 01:53.970
I'm the only one in the club
who talks to this guy.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.637
I guarantee you.
Do you talk to him?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.803
Not for nine months.
He's annoying as hell.

01:57.803 --> 01:59.554
I really would love to reset
the whole relationship

01:59.554 --> 02:02.803
so I could just drive up,
wave, and be on my way.

02:02.803 --> 02:04.387
I think it's a big bowl
of too late.

02:04.387 --> 02:05.803
You're on your own.

02:05.803 --> 02:07.761
Secretly,

02:07.761 --> 02:10.303
I wish ill things on him
so I don't have to
do this anymore.

02:10.303 --> 02:12.220
It's a terrible thought,
but that's what I think.

02:12.220 --> 02:14.720
By the way, where's
my John Adams biography?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.554
I lent it to you
about six weeks ago.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.011
Yeah, so sorry.

02:18.011 --> 02:19.137
For what reason
do you want it back?

02:19.137 --> 02:20.512
Just to what,
to impress people?

02:20.512 --> 02:22.886
Well, I impressed myself first
that I finished it.

02:22.886 --> 02:24.679
- It's a big book.
It's a fat book.
- Did you?

02:24.679 --> 02:26.011
- Yes.
- Did you finish it?

02:26.011 --> 02:27.595
Of course
I finished it.

02:27.595 --> 02:29.637
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:29.637 --> 02:31.761
- It was fantastic.
- It was, huh?

02:31.761 --> 02:34.011
- Who knew about
all this stuff?
- Yeah.

02:34.011 --> 02:36.011
Thomas Jefferson,
and the arguing,

02:36.011 --> 02:39.178
- and the White House, and--
- I'm gonna posit this.

02:39.178 --> 02:40.886
I don't think you read it
in the first place.

02:40.886 --> 02:44.053
- What is this, "Dragnet"?
- I don't think you read it.

02:44.053 --> 02:46.262
- I read the inside flap.
- Okay, you read the flap.

02:46.262 --> 02:49.554
- Good, you read the flap.
- I'll make sure he gets it
back to you.

02:49.554 --> 02:51.220
- Good afternoon,
gentlemen.
- Hi.

02:51.220 --> 02:53.011
I see you've had a chance
to take a look at the menu.

02:53.011 --> 02:54.845
We do have
one addition today.

02:54.845 --> 02:58.720
It is a Dover sole sautéed
in a lemon butter sauce.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.554
- What are you getting?
- I'm gonna get the beet
and goat cheese salad.

03:02.554 --> 03:05.303
- The Vietnamese pho.
- How do they prepare
the Dover sole?

03:05.303 --> 03:08.303
- What did you say, sautéed?
- It's sautéed in a lemon
butter sauce.

03:08.303 --> 03:10.845
- Do you think
they would broil it?
- I could ask.

03:10.845 --> 03:15.053
Okay, look, ask,
but if the chef makes
a face of any kind, okay,

03:15.053 --> 03:17.137
just tell him
to forget it and sauté it.

03:17.137 --> 03:18.845
- I understand.
- Okay, thank you.

03:18.845 --> 03:19.970
Okay.

03:19.970 --> 03:21.220
Richard:
Thanks.

03:21.220 --> 03:22.554
I cannot stay long.

03:22.554 --> 03:26.011
I have to go suit shopping
with my daughter

03:26.011 --> 03:29.595
and my soon-to-be son-in-law
for the wedding.

03:29.595 --> 03:31.845
Yeah, his daughter Sammi's
getting married.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.720
You're kidding me.
Congratulations.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.554
- What kind of guy is he?
- He served in the war
in Afghanistan.

03:37.554 --> 03:39.345
- And, uh...
- Wow.

03:39.345 --> 03:41.011
- Yeah.
- Richard: Is he okay?

03:41.011 --> 03:42.803
No PTSD.
He's one of
the lucky ones.

03:42.803 --> 03:44.886
I asked the chef
to broil the sole,

03:44.886 --> 03:46.761
and he didn't make
much of a face.

03:46.761 --> 03:48.262
Didn't make much
of a face.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.053
What kind of face
is not much of a face?

03:50.053 --> 03:51.720
Well, he can be
a bit inscrutable,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.720
but I wouldn't describe it
as much of a face at all.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.637
Hmm. I'd like
to see that face.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.053
What did--
show it to me.

03:58.053 --> 04:00.512
I asked the chef
if he could broil the sole,

04:00.512 --> 04:02.928
and he went...
( sighs )

04:02.928 --> 04:04.761
( sighs )
Like that?

04:04.761 --> 04:07.761
- ( sighs )
- Well, that's
not much of a face.

04:07.761 --> 04:09.429
- No.
- Okay.

04:09.429 --> 04:12.761
- I'll get it--
I'll get it broiled.
- All right.

04:12.761 --> 04:15.095
- Hey, guys.
- Larry: All right,
thank you so much.

04:15.095 --> 04:17.429
- Hey, Larry.
Hold on.
- Okay.

04:17.429 --> 04:19.095
- How are you, Larry?
- Hey, Ken.

04:19.095 --> 04:20.262
- How you doing?
- Larry: Good.

04:20.262 --> 04:21.303
- Hey, Ken.
- How are you guys?

04:21.303 --> 04:22.470
His wife
just had a baby.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.886
- Oh, the baby!
- Yeah.

04:23.886 --> 04:26.137
- You got a picture?
- Boom. There you go.

04:26.137 --> 04:28.803
Wow! Oh!
Beautiful!

04:28.803 --> 04:30.137
- Ken: Huh?
- Lucky man.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.970
- Thank you so much.
- Ah.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.011
My greatest
treasure.

04:34.011 --> 04:36.387
You know, she looks
a little Asian.

04:39.970 --> 04:41.970
Um, wha-what do you--
what does that mean?

04:41.970 --> 04:45.512
She has a look--
a little Asian look
about her.

04:45.512 --> 04:48.803
That's-- that's weird.
It's a strange thing
to say, Larry.

04:48.803 --> 04:51.470
- Why? What's the big deal?
- What are you getting at,
is all I'm asking.

04:51.470 --> 04:53.886
'Cause most people
would just say, first,
she's beautiful.

04:53.886 --> 04:57.095
I'm saying that,
you know, she just has
a slight Asian look to her.

04:57.095 --> 04:59.470
I feel like you're maybe
saying something's--

04:59.470 --> 05:00.970
something's off
about her.

05:00.970 --> 05:03.053
I'm not saying--
something's on about it.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.303
It's good.
It's a good thing.

05:04.303 --> 05:05.470
- Uh-huh.
- That's a compliment.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.886
- In what way?
- Huge.

05:06.886 --> 05:08.429
- How so?
- She's exotic.

05:08.429 --> 05:10.345
I-- I wish I looked
a little Asian.

05:10.345 --> 05:11.554
Look, I just wanna
walk away.

05:11.554 --> 05:13.178
Can you just--
just take it back

05:13.178 --> 05:15.178
so we can just
put this behind us?

05:15.178 --> 05:17.137
I can apologize
for offending you,

05:17.137 --> 05:18.803
but I can't take back
the remark.

05:18.803 --> 05:23.011
I just want you to say,
"This was my fault.
I apologize."

05:23.011 --> 05:24.178
And then
I can move on.

05:24.178 --> 05:25.720
It's my fault
for offending you.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.178
I apologize.
But she does look
a little Asian.

05:28.178 --> 05:30.011
- Okay, goodbye.
- ( Jeff groans )

05:30.011 --> 05:31.720
- Richard: We all
think she's gorgeous.
- I'm-- I'm sorry, Ken.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.803
I'm sorry.
It's a cute baby,

05:33.803 --> 05:36.011
but she does look a little--
you didn't think she looked
a little Asian?

05:36.011 --> 05:36.928
She looked
a little Asian.

05:39.845 --> 05:41.303
( doorbell rings )

05:44.470 --> 05:47.886
- Who's there?
- Woman: U.S. Postal Service.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.679
( lock clicks )

05:50.679 --> 05:53.262
Mr. David?
I need a signature.

05:53.262 --> 05:56.803
Are you, uh--
are you the new mailman?

05:56.803 --> 05:58.679
- Mailwoman?
- Mail carrier.

05:58.679 --> 06:01.554
- Huh, okay.
Mail carrier.
- Yeah.

06:02.928 --> 06:05.554
Great.
I will take this.

06:05.554 --> 06:08.011
- You will take these.
- All right. Okay.

06:08.011 --> 06:09.637
And I will take
my pen.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.220
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.554
- People, they steal pens a lot.
- They really do, don't they?

06:13.554 --> 06:15.803
- I bet you lose
a lot of those...
- I have a truck full of 'em.

06:15.803 --> 06:18.637
I haven't talked
to a mailman in a long--

06:18.637 --> 06:20.387
mail carrier
in a long time.

06:20.387 --> 06:22.595
I remember in my building
in Brooklyn growing up,

06:22.595 --> 06:24.970
the women,
they used to flirt
with the mailmen.

06:24.970 --> 06:27.095
They'd come down
in the morning with
their shmatas.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.928
- You know, it was--
- What's a shmata?

06:28.928 --> 06:31.345
A shm-- it's a-- like,
a disgusting house dress.

06:31.345 --> 06:32.928
- It's-- they're hideous.
- Oh, boy. Oh.

06:32.928 --> 06:34.512
You know, my mother
used to encourage me

06:34.512 --> 06:36.095
to work in the post office
when I was younger

06:36.095 --> 06:38.679
'cause she didn't think
I could amount to anything.

06:38.679 --> 06:41.387
- And look what happened.
- And that's not to say that you
couldn't amount to anything.

06:41.387 --> 06:44.345
( chuckles )
But, you know,
she felt that way about me

06:44.345 --> 06:47.637
'cause she wanted me to have
the security of a job,
that's all, you know.

06:47.637 --> 06:49.220
And she thought
it would be easy for me.

06:49.220 --> 06:52.429
Not that it's easy,
but she thought it'd
be easy for me,

06:52.429 --> 06:53.679
because it's
not that much doing.

06:53.679 --> 06:54.845
You bring mail,
you drop it off.

06:54.845 --> 06:56.595
She thought
I could do this.

06:56.595 --> 07:01.095
Uh, yeah.
Anyway, you could
do me a big favor.

07:01.095 --> 07:02.554
Not big,
small favor.

07:02.554 --> 07:04.429
I-- I don't wanna
taint the favor.

07:04.429 --> 07:06.095
- It's a small favor.
- Okay.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.512
Is Richard Lewis
on your route?
He must be.

07:10.512 --> 07:13.761
- Richard-- two blocks over?
- Yes. Have you been to
his house yet today?

07:13.761 --> 07:16.053
Not yet. No.

07:16.053 --> 07:17.595
Could you drop
a book off for me?

07:17.595 --> 07:19.345
I absolutely could.

07:19.345 --> 07:21.970
You'd need to package it up
and put on a stamp.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.303
Look,
I could do that.

07:23.303 --> 07:25.095
I mean, the idea is
that you're going there.

07:25.095 --> 07:27.679
Why not just
drop the book off,
do me a little favor?

07:27.679 --> 07:28.970
It's a little favor.
It's nothing.

07:28.970 --> 07:30.470
I'm pretty sure
the U.S. government

07:30.470 --> 07:33.720
would consider that free mail,
which is kind of illegal.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.886
Don't be such a stickler.
Why are you being
such a stickler?

07:35.886 --> 07:38.178
- It's just--
- Do you think that's
a good quality, stickling?

07:38.178 --> 07:41.137
- Don't stickle.
Don't be a stickler.
- Don't be a stickler?

07:41.137 --> 07:43.387
No. You know what,
if you were going on
a computer date,

07:43.387 --> 07:47.137
one of those things,
and you put down "stickler,"
nobody would call you.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.429
Well, it might be
why I'm still single.

07:49.429 --> 07:51.137
Ah.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.095
Susie: Hey, Jeff,
did you tell Lewis
about our new kitchen?

07:55.095 --> 07:57.137
- No, I did not.
- In the new house?

07:57.137 --> 08:00.178
Richie, it is massive,
this new kitchen.

08:00.178 --> 08:03.137
I mean,
it is just magnificent.

08:03.137 --> 08:05.053
You, especially,
are going to appreciate it.

08:05.053 --> 08:08.512
- I can't wait, honey.
- Why are you especially?

08:08.512 --> 08:10.178
- I have no fucking idea.
- Larry: Yeah, I...

08:10.178 --> 08:13.137
Can I just say something?
It was a genius idea
to start with.

08:13.137 --> 08:15.928
- Oh, fantastic.
- You know, for a married man,
a realtor?

08:15.928 --> 08:18.679
- Come on, man. The best.
- Oh, Jeff,

08:18.679 --> 08:21.303
can you go to the basement
and get me a couple
bottles of wine?

08:21.303 --> 08:22.845
A red and a white,
please?

08:22.845 --> 08:25.053
Could I?
Well, I think I could.

08:25.053 --> 08:26.178
I think I could.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.679
Thank you.

08:29.679 --> 08:31.345
Hey, did you get
the book?

08:31.345 --> 08:32.512
Yeah, yeah.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.637
Oh, the mailwoman,
wow!

08:35.637 --> 08:36.720
She's gorgeous.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.220
I'm thinking
of making a move.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.220
- On the mailwoman?
- I don't care what she does.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.595
No profession's
off-limits to me
if a woman's attractive.

08:42.595 --> 08:45.387
All men are like that.
We don't care about
what they do.

08:45.387 --> 08:47.554
We care about
what they look like.
Women are just the opposite.

08:47.554 --> 08:50.053
I think you might be right.
I dated a garbagewoman.

08:50.053 --> 08:52.303
- And we'd shower.
- You dated your
garbagewoman?

08:52.303 --> 08:53.970
We had the shower,
that was the only thing.

08:53.970 --> 08:55.595
Yeah, she was great and smart,
but she needed the money.

08:55.595 --> 08:57.720
- She had a couple of kids.
- I never even saw

08:57.720 --> 08:58.720
a garbagewoman
in my life.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.011
You make up
this story to me

09:00.011 --> 09:01.595
about fucking
a garbagewoman?

09:01.595 --> 09:03.262
- A story would be this--
- That's really odd to me

09:03.262 --> 09:05.303
that you would
make up this story
for what?

09:05.303 --> 09:07.262
- No, here's a fact--
- So I would think

09:07.262 --> 09:09.803
that you fucked a garbagewoman?
Why do you want me
to think that?

09:09.803 --> 09:11.845
- I didn't see her
as a garbagewoman.
- Susie: Hey, Lar?

09:11.845 --> 09:14.303
All right, we're--
we're done. Yeah.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.345
- Hey, Lar,
eat something.
- Hey.

09:17.345 --> 09:18.970
- Are these washed?
- Of course.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.928
What are you--
what kind of question
is that to ask me?

09:20.928 --> 09:23.761
- They look a little sticky.
- They're washed and organic.

09:23.761 --> 09:26.178
Hey, I got
the wedding invite.

09:26.178 --> 09:28.262
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't?

09:28.262 --> 09:30.387
No, that was a save the date.
That was not the invite.

09:30.387 --> 09:31.761
I haven't even had them
printed yet.

09:31.761 --> 09:33.262
- Save the date?
- Yeah.

09:33.262 --> 09:35.262
Are you serious?
That's so stupid.

09:35.262 --> 09:36.679
Larry, everybody
saves dates.

09:36.679 --> 09:37.803
I don't save dates.

09:37.803 --> 09:38.928
The whole system's
screwed up.

09:38.928 --> 09:40.637
You don't need
to send me something

09:40.637 --> 09:42.886
to tell me you're gonna
send me something,
just send it.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.554
If I'm saying
something to you,
I don't say to you,

09:45.554 --> 09:47.595
"I'm gonna say
something to you,"
and then say it.

09:47.595 --> 09:50.761
- I just say it.
- This is the way things
are done, okay, asshole?

09:50.761 --> 09:52.970
You're gonna come,
and you're gonna enjoy it!

09:54.470 --> 09:56.512
All right.
Watch this.

09:58.761 --> 10:00.637
- Terrific.
- Ta-da!

10:00.637 --> 10:03.095
- Unbelievable.
- ( chuckles )
Ta-- come on.

10:03.095 --> 10:06.803
- Ah, look who's here!
The happy couple.
- Hi, everybody.

10:06.803 --> 10:08.470
- Mrs. Greene.
- Oh, my baby.

10:08.470 --> 10:11.220
- Hi, Mom.
- ( kisses )
Victor, my boy.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.637
- How you doing?
How you doing?
- ( kisses )

10:12.637 --> 10:14.803
Okay, so this is
our friend, Richard Lewis.

10:14.803 --> 10:18.053
- Thank you
for your service, bro.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

10:18.053 --> 10:19.928
And our neighbors,
Leslie and John.

10:19.928 --> 10:22.137
What a hero you are.
Thank you for your service.

10:22.137 --> 10:23.970
Oh, thank you.
The real heroes
are still there,

10:23.970 --> 10:25.554
- but I appreciate that.
- Thank you for your service.

10:25.554 --> 10:27.137
- Thank you.
- You have a grateful nation.

10:27.137 --> 10:28.886
And this is
our friend, Larry.

10:28.886 --> 10:29.970
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:29.970 --> 10:30.886
Nice to meet you.

10:40.387 --> 10:44.053
Um, yeah, it's, uh...
( chuckles )

10:44.053 --> 10:47.137
You know what?
Um, I'm gonna excuse myself.

10:47.137 --> 10:49.053
Victor.

10:49.053 --> 10:51.845
- Victor.
- Huh? What-- what's...?

10:51.845 --> 10:54.220
You didn't thank him
for his service, asshole.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.803
They thanked him.
Three people thanked him.
Why do I have to thank him?

10:56.803 --> 10:58.928
Fuck, how hard
would it have been?
"Thank you for your service."

10:58.928 --> 11:01.011
Does everybody
have to thank him
for his service?

11:01.011 --> 11:02.761
Now you've ruined
everything, Larry.

11:02.761 --> 11:04.554
I'm making all this
delicious salmon,

11:04.554 --> 11:06.095
and the whole night
is ruined.

11:06.095 --> 11:07.970
- Are you
sautéing that?
- Yes.

11:07.970 --> 11:09.262
Would you mind
broiling mine?

11:11.011 --> 11:13.803
- That a face?
- Get the fuck out.
Leave.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.303
Hmm. Okay.

11:15.303 --> 11:17.137
- Thank you for serving
the hors d'oeuvres.
- Out!

11:17.137 --> 11:19.845
Um, thank you for being
a very good manager.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.928
Thank you for coming over
in this brisk weather.

11:21.928 --> 11:23.970
Thank you for leaving!

11:23.970 --> 11:26.803
Larry:
Must be a lot of work
carrying the mail bag around.

11:26.803 --> 11:28.095
You know
what you could use?

11:28.095 --> 11:29.803
You could use a caddy
on the route.

11:29.803 --> 11:32.053
- I would love
a mail caddy.
- Right?

11:32.053 --> 11:34.053
- Are you kidding me?
- They carry the mail for you.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.262
- Yes.
- 'Cause you walk as much
as I do on a golf course.

11:36.262 --> 11:37.928
- And you're, you know--
you're carrying--
- Probably more.

11:37.928 --> 11:39.554
- I have a caddy.
- I would love a mail caddy.

11:39.554 --> 11:41.637
They'll give you instructions.
"Okay, go up the path,

11:41.637 --> 11:44.387
make a right, you know,
watch out for the dog."

11:44.387 --> 11:46.011
- Yeah.
- I'll mail caddy for you.

11:46.011 --> 11:47.220
- Would you?
- Yeah.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.470
Just talk to
the U.S. government.

11:48.470 --> 11:50.011
I think your mom
would be so proud.

11:50.011 --> 11:51.387
All right,
so what do you want again?

11:51.387 --> 11:53.095
Do you want the--
did you say Milk Duds?

11:53.095 --> 11:54.387
- Milk Duds,
Reese's Pieces...
- Really?

11:54.387 --> 11:56.387
...Junior Mints,
popcorn-- big popcorn.

11:56.387 --> 11:59.554
- And we'll mix them
all together. It's...
- We'll what?

11:59.554 --> 12:01.845
Oh, it's-- it's like
the perfect bite.

12:01.845 --> 12:03.928
It's, like, a little sweet
and a little salty.

12:03.928 --> 12:05.928
- The textures--
- What are you mixing
sweet and salty for?

12:05.928 --> 12:07.512
They're--
they're in conflict.

12:07.512 --> 12:08.928
No, they're
in cahoots.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.470
I don't want
Reese's Pieces
in my popcorn.

12:12.470 --> 12:15.470
It's the perfect
movie treat, I promise.

12:15.470 --> 12:16.845
Do you have
the tickets?

12:16.845 --> 12:18.053
Oh, yeah.
Here you go.

12:18.053 --> 12:19.595
Oh, hey, thanks.
All right.

12:19.595 --> 12:20.928
- I'll get a seat.
- Eh, get me an aisle.

12:20.928 --> 12:22.470
- Thank you.
- Okay.

12:24.262 --> 12:27.178
( film music playing )

12:27.178 --> 12:28.845
Jean? Jean?

12:35.637 --> 12:36.720
Jean?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.137
- ( horse neighs )
- Jean?

12:38.137 --> 12:40.429
Jean? Jean?

12:40.429 --> 12:42.387
- Jean?
- Man: Shh.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.303
( whispers )
Yeah, okay, okay.

12:44.303 --> 12:45.970
Sorry, sorry.

12:45.970 --> 12:47.886
- Jean?
- Man: Shh.

12:47.886 --> 12:49.970
Jean? Jean? Jean!

12:49.970 --> 12:52.137
I'm right here.
I'm here.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.387
Oh, there you are.
Great.

12:54.387 --> 12:56.595
Excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me.

12:56.595 --> 12:59.303
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

12:59.303 --> 13:01.554
- You're so loud.
- I'm so loud?

13:01.554 --> 13:03.845
I don't understand.
I've been looking for you
for five minutes.

13:03.845 --> 13:06.345
- How come you didn't beckon?
- Why didn't-- why didn't
I beckon?

13:06.345 --> 13:08.928
Yes, you beckon.
You knew I was coming
into the theater.

13:08.928 --> 13:11.137
You gotta wave.
You gotta go like this
so I can see you.

13:11.137 --> 13:12.387
Just look around.
I'm right here.

13:12.387 --> 13:14.137
You-- I can't see
anything from down there.

13:14.137 --> 13:15.761
I'm not gonna
make a scene.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.137
Oh, who's telling you
to make a scene?

13:17.137 --> 13:19.429
Just wave.
Beckon. Beckon.
You gotta beckon.

13:19.429 --> 13:22.137
- That's making a scene.
- Beckoning is not
making a scene.

13:22.137 --> 13:25.095
Making a scene is calling out
the name Jean 10 times.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.470
- Man: Would you shut up?
- You shut up.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.803
Didn't have to
call out my name.

13:28.803 --> 13:30.262
I did because
I couldn't find you.

13:30.262 --> 13:32.637
- All you had to do was look.
- I did look.

13:41.512 --> 13:43.512
What the fuck
is going on here?

13:48.011 --> 13:49.637
( sighs )

13:53.928 --> 13:57.220
Okay, well, guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.720
Yeah, yeah,
you're delivering.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.137
Yeah.

14:02.137 --> 14:04.178
You know what?

14:04.178 --> 14:06.886
I think we ought
to go back

14:06.886 --> 14:10.053
to our previous relationship
of homeowner and mailwoman.

14:10.053 --> 14:14.011
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I have a very difficult time
dating somebody who I'm seeing

14:14.011 --> 14:16.387
on a daily basis-- with you--
like, six times a week.

14:16.387 --> 14:19.387
You know, I've gotta
psych myself up for dates.
It's a big performance.

14:19.387 --> 14:22.429
I gotta shower and shave
and prepare witticisms,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.512
and, you know, it's--
it's a whole thing, and--

14:24.512 --> 14:25.803
Is this what you did
for tonight?

14:25.803 --> 14:27.970
Did you prepare
witticisms for tonight?

14:27.970 --> 14:31.095
Yeah, that whole thing about
the made-up Jewish holiday
"Shecooktus,"

14:31.095 --> 14:33.720
that was all--
that was prepared
beforehand, yeah.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.011
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:35.011 --> 14:36.554
If you-- if you're
working for UPS

14:36.554 --> 14:38.761
and I saw you
maybe two times a week,

14:38.761 --> 14:40.220
that would be--
that would be fine.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.970
But I-- I have to see you
six times a week.

14:42.970 --> 14:46.053
So, I'd love
to hit the reset button
and just, you know,

14:46.053 --> 14:48.303
we go back to, uh,
homeowner-mailwoman.

14:48.303 --> 14:50.262
No.

14:50.262 --> 14:52.387
- Why not-- wha-- no?
- No.

14:52.387 --> 14:55.262
What, you feel
we're beyond resetting?

14:55.262 --> 14:58.053
- Yeah, I think we are.
- Why?

14:58.053 --> 14:59.595
- Why?
- Yeah, you reset.

14:59.595 --> 15:01.303
- Let's hit the button.
- I don't think I can do that.

15:01.303 --> 15:02.845
Yeah, we hit the--
we hit the big button.

15:02.845 --> 15:04.679
You can't
just press a button.

15:04.679 --> 15:06.095
You can't just
press a button.

15:06.095 --> 15:07.387
Why-- why not?

15:10.053 --> 15:11.803
That a face?

15:11.803 --> 15:13.429
- ( sighs )
- What was it?

15:13.429 --> 15:14.886
What did
the face mean?

15:17.137 --> 15:18.512
What?

15:21.928 --> 15:23.637
Good--
good night.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.011
( sighs )

15:31.011 --> 15:32.595
- Mr. David.
- Hey, Sal.

15:32.595 --> 15:34.345
What ever happened
to rabbit ears?

15:34.345 --> 15:36.928
I can't tell you
how many times my cable
has gone down

15:36.928 --> 15:38.679
right in the middle
of one of my favorite shows.

15:38.679 --> 15:40.303
- Really?
- Has that ever
happened to you?

15:40.303 --> 15:41.554
It's one
of those things.

15:41.554 --> 15:42.970
You're sitting,
you're enjoying,

15:42.970 --> 15:44.679
you've got a nice little
cup of coffee made,

15:44.679 --> 15:47.137
you're ready
to enjoy the news,
a little TV show--

15:47.137 --> 15:48.637
boom, what happens?

15:48.637 --> 15:50.303
The cable goes down.

15:50.303 --> 15:51.970
- Sal, Sal.
- Isn't it horrible?

15:51.970 --> 15:55.137
( stammering )
We can't do this anymore.

15:55.137 --> 15:56.512
Do what, sir?

15:56.512 --> 15:59.512
I'd like to hit
the reset button
on our relationship

15:59.512 --> 16:01.345
and-- and go back
to the way it was

16:01.345 --> 16:04.679
before I ever
put the window down
and started talking.

16:04.679 --> 16:08.303
You know, just drive in
with the window up, wave,
and-- and move on.

16:08.303 --> 16:10.970
- You know, like everybody else.
- You don't enjoy our
conversations?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.178
No, I wouldn't say
I don't enjoy them, but...

16:13.178 --> 16:15.262
- I haven't upset you
in any way...
- No, I'm just--

16:15.262 --> 16:17.387
- I'm very anxious to play--
- I don't mean to be
forward, sir.

16:17.387 --> 16:19.429
No, no, no,
it's nothing
like that at all.

16:19.429 --> 16:21.595
- I just like to get
to the golf course.
- Yes, of course.

16:21.595 --> 16:23.345
- You want to play
with your friends.
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:23.345 --> 16:25.470
I understand exactly
what you're saying,
Mr. David.

16:25.470 --> 16:27.554
- I'm excited
to play, and I can't--
- Well, you can be excited.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.512
- You won't have me
to worry about anymore.
- I'm not--

16:29.512 --> 16:31.928
I'm not worried about--
it wasn't that.

16:31.928 --> 16:33.761
Come on,
d-don't be mad.

16:33.761 --> 16:35.679
- I'm not mad, sir.
- I mean, I'll still drive by.

16:35.679 --> 16:37.262
I'll still see you
with the window up,

16:37.262 --> 16:39.970
and-- I'll see you
with the window up
and I'll wave,

16:39.970 --> 16:42.220
you know, the way--
the way it used to be.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.011
Good.
( sniffs )

16:44.011 --> 16:45.512
Good day, mister.

16:47.303 --> 16:49.470
Eh. Ah.

16:49.470 --> 16:51.053
Sorry.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.720
Sorry.

16:52.720 --> 16:53.803
I'm sorry.

16:59.303 --> 17:03.554
Listen, I guess,
I don't wanna keep
harping on it,

17:03.554 --> 17:06.679
but Victor
is so obsessed.

17:06.679 --> 17:10.387
I won't even say hurt.
He's obsessed with you not
thanking him for his service.

17:10.387 --> 17:13.095
- It really makes him nuts.
- There's something about
the expression

17:13.095 --> 17:15.220
that I can't quite
get it out of my mouth.

17:15.220 --> 17:16.720
'Cause remember,
he loves "Seinfeld,"

17:16.720 --> 17:18.803
was so looking forward
to spending time with you.

17:18.803 --> 17:21.637
- He just wanted you to...
- Wow, really? My God.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.637
- Just acknowledge the guy.
- Is there anything I can do?

17:24.637 --> 17:26.720
Should I take him
out to lunch?

17:26.720 --> 17:30.220
( scoffs )
You know that Sal

17:30.220 --> 17:31.845
at the gate,
the security guard?

17:31.845 --> 17:34.512
- Mm-hmm.
- He does this, um,

17:34.512 --> 17:36.761
Revolutionary War
reenactment stuff.

17:36.761 --> 17:40.803
- There's one coming up
right here at Will Rogers.
- Okay.

17:40.803 --> 17:43.429
Do you have any idea
how big that would be
for him?

17:43.429 --> 17:45.095
I've heard him talk
about those things.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.886
- Really?
- Yes. He's never gone.

17:47.886 --> 17:50.928
He will love it!
Oh, my God, would he love it.

17:50.928 --> 17:53.178
W-we'll do--
we'll dress up
as soldiers.

17:53.178 --> 17:55.137
- You dress on up.
- I'd love to.

17:55.137 --> 17:56.928
- So it is a good thing
you lowered your window.
- Yeah.

17:56.928 --> 17:58.845
Sir, Mr. Takahashi
would like a word with you.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.595
Okay.

18:00.595 --> 18:02.095
Well, send him
my best.

18:02.095 --> 18:03.387
This can't be good.

18:07.095 --> 18:08.554
Ah, hey,
Chef Curtis.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.512
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. You got a second?

18:10.512 --> 18:11.637
Uh, sure.

18:11.637 --> 18:13.761
Do you remember
the other day,

18:13.761 --> 18:18.554
uh, a waiter asked
if you would broil
the sole?

18:18.554 --> 18:20.512
- Yeah, that's, um-- yep.
- Remember that?

18:20.512 --> 18:24.095
And I'm wondering
when he asked you
that question,

18:24.095 --> 18:27.178
did you-- did you make
a face, by any chance?

18:27.178 --> 18:31.262
- I may have made
a small face, probably. Sure.
- You made a small face?

18:31.262 --> 18:33.303
Would you mind
showing me that face?

18:33.303 --> 18:35.429
- I'd love to see it.
- It's-- I don't--

18:35.429 --> 18:37.429
- I don't think that's-- mm.
- I'd love-- I'd love
to see the face.

18:37.429 --> 18:39.637
Eh, nobody's watching.
Come on, make a face,
make a face.

18:39.637 --> 18:43.053
( sighs )
It was probably
something like...

18:43.053 --> 18:44.595
( sputters )

18:44.595 --> 18:46.803
- Really?
- Yeah, that's...

18:46.803 --> 18:49.470
( stammering )
You did a semi-horse
whinny?

18:49.470 --> 18:51.761
I-- I mean, if you wanna
call it that, sure.

18:51.761 --> 18:53.387
Wow, that's a pretty
strong reaction.

18:53.387 --> 18:54.470
Well, it was
a strong request.

18:54.470 --> 18:55.720
- Was it?
- Yeah.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.220
You know, I prepare it
the way I prepare it

18:58.220 --> 19:00.761
- because it's better.
- I gotta tell you something.

19:00.761 --> 19:03.554
That's not the face that
the waiter presented to me.

19:03.554 --> 19:05.178
The face that
was presented to me
was more like...

19:05.178 --> 19:08.303
- ( blowing breath )
- I don't...

19:08.303 --> 19:09.845
No, I would never
make that face.

19:09.845 --> 19:12.470
That face doesn't even
communicate anything.

19:12.470 --> 19:13.928
( blowing breath )
What's that?

19:13.928 --> 19:16.178
Well, maybe--
maybe it was more...
( exhales )

19:16.178 --> 19:18.220
( blows breath )
No, that's-- I don't...

19:18.220 --> 19:19.720
It was definitely
an expulsion--

19:19.720 --> 19:22.011
there was an expulsion
of air, I'm sure.
( blows )

19:22.011 --> 19:23.178
- ( blows )
- ( blows )

19:23.178 --> 19:25.845
( blows )

19:25.845 --> 19:28.011
- ( blows )
- That doesn't seem close.

19:28.011 --> 19:29.845
- Not close?
- No, it doesn't seem close.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.845
All right, so, anyway,
I want to apologize.

19:31.845 --> 19:33.845
Had I known that
you made a horse whinny
with an eye roll,

19:33.845 --> 19:35.345
I never would've
told you to broil it.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.011
- I made a face, so...
- Oh, you know what?

19:37.011 --> 19:38.970
Well, yes, look,
there he is right here.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.303
I'm gonna go
talk to him.
Hey.

19:41.303 --> 19:45.303
So, uh, remember
the other day,

19:45.303 --> 19:48.470
you made the face
the, uh-- the chef
made for me?

19:48.470 --> 19:49.387
I remember.

19:49.387 --> 19:50.970
Yeah, well...
( chuckles )

19:50.970 --> 19:55.470
I gotta say,
you weren't even--
not even close.

19:55.470 --> 19:57.262
Massively
undersold it.

19:57.262 --> 19:58.761
What are you
talking about?

19:58.761 --> 20:01.178
The chef said that
he went like this...

20:01.178 --> 20:02.928
( sputters )

20:02.928 --> 20:05.554
- No.
- That's nothing like
what you did.

20:05.554 --> 20:08.053
No, when I went
back to him, I said,
"Can you broil the sole?"

20:08.053 --> 20:10.345
And he said...
( blows breath )

20:10.345 --> 20:13.303
And I came back
and I showed you...
( blows breath )

20:13.303 --> 20:15.303
No, the chef went...
( sputters )

20:15.303 --> 20:17.262
- with an eye roll and--
- I mean, he looked up.

20:17.262 --> 20:19.554
- I don't think
it was an eye roll.
- It was definitely an eye roll.

20:19.554 --> 20:22.095
Shh. He went...
( blows breath )

20:22.095 --> 20:24.928
Not even-- not even that.
He went... ( exhales )

20:24.928 --> 20:26.429
( blowing breath )

20:26.429 --> 20:29.429
No. According to him,
he was... ( sputtering )

20:29.429 --> 20:33.595
No. I went in, and I said,
"Can you broil it?"
He said... ( blows )

20:33.595 --> 20:37.178
I said--
and then I came back to you
and I said... ( blowing )

20:37.178 --> 20:39.137
- ( blows )
- ( blows )

20:39.137 --> 20:40.303
- ( blows )
- ( blows )

20:40.303 --> 20:43.011
- ( blows )
- ( blows )

20:43.011 --> 20:45.679
All right, well,
it's a little confusing,
I must say.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.761
I brought you
exactly what he gave me.

20:47.761 --> 20:49.761
It's a clash
of faces.

20:52.095 --> 20:53.637
- ( knocking on door )
- Enter.

20:55.679 --> 20:57.303
You wanna see me,
Mr. Takahashi?

20:57.303 --> 20:59.011
- Yes.
- Close the door?

20:59.011 --> 20:59.886
Yes.

21:04.387 --> 21:05.262
No.

21:06.303 --> 21:08.512
Um...

21:08.512 --> 21:12.761
so, what is the nature
of the summons?

21:12.761 --> 21:15.470
It has been brought
to my attention

21:15.470 --> 21:20.429
that you have
disgraced Ken Carmen
and his wife, Shelly.

21:20.429 --> 21:21.928
Oh, no.

21:21.928 --> 21:23.637
I made a comment
about their child.

21:23.637 --> 21:25.178
I said it looked
a little Asian,

21:25.178 --> 21:26.761
and it does look
a little Asian.

21:26.761 --> 21:28.679
So what?
It's a compliment--

21:28.679 --> 21:30.512
Stop!

21:30.512 --> 21:33.886
We will decide
what punitive action
to take.

21:33.886 --> 21:35.970
Punitive action?
Why? Wh-why?

21:35.970 --> 21:37.470
Expect a letter soon.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.470
- Soon?
- Yes.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.011
A day? Two days?
Four days?

21:41.011 --> 21:42.429
Everybody know
what "soon" is.

21:42.429 --> 21:43.595
I don't know
what "soon" is.

21:43.595 --> 21:44.803
Soon is soon.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.053
- Soon is not soon.
- Soon is soon.

21:46.053 --> 21:47.011
Soon is not soon.

21:47.011 --> 21:50.011
Soon is when
I say it is.

21:50.011 --> 21:52.429
All right,
I'll expect a letter
in a couple of days

21:52.429 --> 21:53.970
unless you tell me
otherwise right now.

21:53.970 --> 21:54.845
Go!

21:57.970 --> 21:59.053
Go.

22:00.679 --> 22:03.470
Hey, did you get
the mail today?

22:03.470 --> 22:05.679
- Haven't seen any mail.
- Did you check the box?

22:05.679 --> 22:07.178
Twice.
No mail.

22:07.178 --> 22:09.803
- Haven't seen any mail
in three days.
- ( sighs )

22:11.554 --> 22:13.470
( phone ringing )

22:14.845 --> 22:16.387
Hello.
Who is it?

22:16.387 --> 22:19.011
Hey. Did, uh--
did you get mail today?

22:19.011 --> 22:20.512
Of course I got
the mail today.

22:20.512 --> 22:23.011
- Why? What's wrong?
- ( sighs ) Fuck!

22:23.011 --> 22:24.845
All right, thanks.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.137
Damn it!

22:26.137 --> 22:27.387
Mm-hmm.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.053
We're not
getting mail.

22:29.053 --> 22:31.053
The mailwoman
has stopped delivering

22:31.053 --> 22:32.637
since--
since our date.

22:32.637 --> 22:35.387
Had the same situation
with a girl at Burger King.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.429
Haven't had a Whopper
in fucking three years.

22:37.429 --> 22:39.387
Yeah. You can't
go back there, right?

22:39.387 --> 22:41.011
I know, you can't--
you can never go out

22:41.011 --> 22:43.178
with somebody
you have contact with
on a daily basis

22:43.178 --> 22:44.886
or weekly basis
or yearly basis.

22:44.886 --> 22:47.011
You can only date
people you don't know

22:47.011 --> 22:48.637
and you'll never,
ever see.

22:48.637 --> 22:50.886
She has a route to do.
She fucking delivers mail.

22:50.886 --> 22:52.554
She has a fucking route
she gotta fucking hit.

22:52.554 --> 22:55.137
There's also-- there's also
a post office credo.

22:55.137 --> 22:56.554
They should put
"spite" in there.

22:56.554 --> 22:59.637
"Neither rain nor snow
nor heat nor spite

22:59.637 --> 23:01.303
shall keep
these couriers."

23:01.303 --> 23:03.053
That'd be cool,
but that's not how
this shit work.

23:03.053 --> 23:04.637
You hit the fucking
reset button.

23:04.637 --> 23:07.053
I wanted to go back to--
to just her delivering mail

23:07.053 --> 23:08.178
and, uh,
me saying hello.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.803
Now look at us,
no fucking mail.

23:09.803 --> 23:11.928
You know how much shit I got
coming to this house?

23:11.928 --> 23:13.928
- What?
- I got my CD
of the Month Club--

23:13.928 --> 23:15.303
I'm not getting
my fucking CDs--

23:15.303 --> 23:17.178
my DVDs,
all kinds of shit
comes here.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.387
Yeah, you know what I got?
I got a letter from
Mr. Takahashi,

23:19.387 --> 23:22.761
who I'm waiting for, and--
and I'll never get it now.

23:22.761 --> 23:24.803
And now I don't know
if I'm in the club or not.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.429
So, next time
you tap that ass...

23:26.429 --> 23:28.554
I didn't tap--
I didn't tap any ass.

23:28.554 --> 23:30.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Wait a minute.

23:30.928 --> 23:32.220
You didn't tear
that ass up?

23:32.220 --> 23:34.095
No.

23:34.095 --> 23:36.220
- Just a fucking date?
- That's it.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.679
You didn't hit it?

23:37.679 --> 23:39.761
And you going through
the same shit if you had
hit it?

23:39.761 --> 23:42.303
Nope, nope.
I didn't hit it,
I didn't tap it,

23:42.303 --> 23:44.761
I didn't tear into it,
and we still get no mail.

23:44.761 --> 23:45.720
Unbelievable.

23:50.803 --> 23:52.053
Hey, Sal!

24:02.720 --> 24:04.803
Hey, Sal,
put the gate up?

24:04.803 --> 24:06.512
I'm expecting this letter
from the club,

24:06.512 --> 24:08.429
but I had a fight
with my mailwoman,

24:08.429 --> 24:09.761
so I'm not getting
any mail,

24:09.761 --> 24:11.512
and I just wanted
to go find out about,

24:11.512 --> 24:13.554
uh, what-- what the letter
was all about, so.

24:13.554 --> 24:15.137
You're supposed to
get a letter?

24:15.137 --> 24:16.803
Yeah, but
the mailwoman wouldn't--
wouldn't deliver it.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.011
And why is that,
Mr. David?

24:18.011 --> 24:21.803
Uh, I hit the--
the reset button.

24:21.803 --> 24:23.470
- Oh, that button. Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:23.470 --> 24:25.637
You've hit that before,
haven't you, sir?

24:25.637 --> 24:30.387
Unfortunately, Mr. David,
you are at the very top of
the do not admit list.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.679
- You're kidding!
- Mm-hmm.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.387
- Oh, Sal.
- It's the truth.

24:33.387 --> 24:35.595
- Huge misunderstanding here.
- Let me double-check.

24:35.595 --> 24:38.303
No, you're completely forbidden
from entering the premises.

24:38.303 --> 24:39.387
You're not gonna
open the gate?

24:39.387 --> 24:41.803
You're on
our list, sir.

24:41.803 --> 24:44.803
You know what, I was
the only one in this club
who ever spoke to you.

24:44.803 --> 24:47.761
- Sir, please back out.
- I regret every conversation
I had to sit through.

24:47.761 --> 24:53.387
- So unbelievably boring
about your fucking cat...
- Do I need to call security?

24:53.387 --> 24:56.429
I will call security
or I will deal with you
myself, sir.

24:56.429 --> 24:59.053
Not one person
spoke to you except me.

24:59.053 --> 25:00.303
And now I'm being
punished for it?

25:00.303 --> 25:01.595
Sir, you can
back out, please.

25:01.595 --> 25:04.345
10 years I came up here,
I put the window down.

25:04.345 --> 25:07.928
I talked to you,
and I was suffocating

25:07.928 --> 25:10.095
from the bullshit
and drivel

25:10.095 --> 25:11.845
that was coming
out of your mouth...

25:11.845 --> 25:13.220
Back out your car,
please.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.011
And don't bump
into the speaker
on your way out.

25:15.011 --> 25:16.512
- Fine.
- ( tires screech )

25:19.178 --> 25:22.387
( chatter )

25:33.928 --> 25:35.512
Huh? What do you
think, Victor?

25:35.512 --> 25:36.554
( chuckles )
That's a good look.

25:36.554 --> 25:37.720
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.262
Yeah, you look
very honorable.

25:39.262 --> 25:41.387
Hey,
look who's here.

25:41.387 --> 25:43.053
- Hi.
- Good morning,
gentlemen.

25:43.053 --> 25:44.637
Good morning,
Mr. Franklin.

25:44.637 --> 25:46.512
And how are you
this fine day?

25:46.512 --> 25:47.845
I am fine.
And you?

25:47.845 --> 25:49.387
I'm-- I'm well,
thank you.

25:49.387 --> 25:51.595
Now, gentlemen,
make haste slowly.

25:51.595 --> 25:54.178
- Make-- make haste slowly.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.845
- Make haste slowly.
- ( chuckles )

25:55.845 --> 25:57.761
- Huh? You like that?
- Yeah, I like that.

25:57.761 --> 25:59.429
Attention, camp.

25:59.429 --> 26:02.095
His Excellency,
General George Washington.

26:02.095 --> 26:04.387
Thank you, General,
for the kind introduction.

26:04.387 --> 26:07.679
As you were, gentlemen.
And who are these fine
gentlemen here?

26:07.679 --> 26:08.928
General:
Recruits, sir.

26:08.928 --> 26:10.387
Private Chesnik
reporting for duty, sir.

26:10.387 --> 26:12.595
Lieutenant David
reporting for duty, sir!

26:12.595 --> 26:16.345
- Lieutenant?
- I, uh-- I elevated myself
somewhat, yes.

26:16.345 --> 26:18.803
Okay, well, are you ready
to die for your country?

26:18.803 --> 26:21.137
I'm ready to play dead
for my country,

26:21.137 --> 26:24.429
which nobody
could do like I can
if I put my mind to it.

26:24.429 --> 26:28.679
Indeed, well, gentlemen,
I have lots of work to do
to tend to an army,

26:28.679 --> 26:31.262
- so we shall
see you at the end.
- Yes. Go, tend to your army.

26:31.262 --> 26:33.595
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

26:33.595 --> 26:35.637
He's quite
a disappointment.
( chuckles )

26:35.637 --> 26:38.053
( music playing )

26:39.637 --> 26:41.595
General:
Attention!

26:46.345 --> 26:47.720
Battalion!

26:47.720 --> 26:49.595
- Man: Company!
- Men: Ready!

26:49.595 --> 26:52.345
- Forward at
the half step.
- All right!

26:52.345 --> 26:54.803
- March!
- Man: March!

26:54.803 --> 26:56.803
( music playing )

26:58.512 --> 27:00.137
Redcoat:
Ready!

27:00.137 --> 27:03.345
Forward... march!

27:03.345 --> 27:06.303
General:
Battalion halt!

27:06.303 --> 27:08.637
- Man: Halt!
- Men: Halt!

27:08.637 --> 27:10.220
Front rank, ready?

27:10.220 --> 27:11.970
Man:
Make ready!

27:11.970 --> 27:15.095
( men shouting )

27:15.095 --> 27:16.470
Take aim!

27:16.470 --> 27:17.803
Generals:
Fire!

27:20.095 --> 27:21.761
General:
Fire!

27:21.761 --> 27:23.554
( groans )

27:23.554 --> 27:25.262
What are you--
what are you doing?

27:25.262 --> 27:26.928
You got three hours
to go, here.

27:26.928 --> 27:29.429
Are you crazy?
Get up. This is nuts.

27:29.429 --> 27:31.095
General:
By God, sir,
get back in rank.

27:31.095 --> 27:32.512
Larry:
You're not
gonna have any fun.

27:32.512 --> 27:34.970
Come on, he's not
gonna have any fun.

27:34.970 --> 27:37.220
That's not fair.
It's not fair.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.303
Let him live.
Let him live.

27:40.595 --> 27:42.220
Larry come on,
get back in line.

27:42.220 --> 27:43.554
- Fall back, come on.
- No. It's so stupid.

27:45.512 --> 27:48.886
General:
Reload! Reload!

27:48.886 --> 27:50.512
- Victor: Hey, Larry.
- Larry: What the hell was that?

27:50.512 --> 27:52.178
- Victor: What was that?
- Larry: Was that real?

27:52.178 --> 27:53.345
There's a crater
in the ground.

27:53.345 --> 27:55.178
Both:
Oh, my God!

27:55.178 --> 27:57.387
Larry! Larry!
What the hell is this, man?

27:57.387 --> 27:59.345
- This is real!
This is real!
- Oh, my God.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.720
Victor:
Somebody's
shooting at us, man!

28:02.845 --> 28:04.554
Ah! Incoming!

28:04.554 --> 28:06.095
It's live rounds, Larry!

28:06.095 --> 28:08.137
- What the fuck?
- It's Sal!

28:08.137 --> 28:09.886
- Sal? Who's Sal?
- Sal.

28:09.886 --> 28:11.554
Larry:
He's a security guard
from my golf club.

28:11.554 --> 28:13.095
Why is he trying
to kill us, man?

28:13.095 --> 28:14.886
I told him
I didn't wanna say
hello to him anymore.

28:14.886 --> 28:16.595
- What?
- ( gasps )

28:16.595 --> 28:18.512
Hello, Sal!
I'm sorry!

28:18.512 --> 28:20.512
( yells )

28:20.512 --> 28:22.928
- Incoming!
- ( Larry grunts )

28:22.928 --> 28:24.761
Aah!

28:24.761 --> 28:26.761
( high-pitched ringing )

28:26.761 --> 28:29.137
- ( explosions )
- ( machine-gun fire )

28:29.137 --> 28:30.679
( muffled )
Hello!

28:30.679 --> 28:31.970
How's your cat?

28:31.970 --> 28:34.262
( helicopter blades
whirring )

28:34.262 --> 28:36.345
Hello, Sal.
How you doing?

28:36.345 --> 28:41.053
Soldier's voice: Hot.
Hot contact, hot contact.
We need air now.

28:41.053 --> 28:44.512
- ( Larry shouting, muffled )
- Soldier's voice: Man down!
Man down!

28:44.512 --> 28:46.595
Come on!
Come on!

28:46.595 --> 28:48.470
Let's go!
Come on!

28:49.761 --> 28:52.095
( choir singing )

29:01.761 --> 29:03.262
( man shouting )

29:05.053 --> 29:07.886
For Britain
and King George!

29:07.886 --> 29:10.595
( shouting )

29:10.595 --> 29:15.470
- Charge!
- ( all shouting )

29:15.470 --> 29:18.262
( both panting )

29:18.262 --> 29:20.720
Larry!
Larry, get up, get up.
Are you all right?

29:20.720 --> 29:22.803
Yeah.
I'm good, yeah.
( panting )

29:22.803 --> 29:25.220
- What the...?
- Motherfucking redcoats!

29:25.220 --> 29:27.345
God, those
motherfuckers.

29:27.345 --> 29:29.637
- God damn it,
what the hell was that?
- Come on, come on.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.595
Fuck.
God damn it.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.303
Come on.
I have no idea
where we are.

29:34.303 --> 29:35.720
No idea.

29:35.720 --> 29:38.803
You know what?
I think I know
where the car is.

29:38.803 --> 29:41.053
I think it's that way.

29:41.053 --> 29:42.970
Yeah.

29:42.970 --> 29:44.803
"Mister Tee"?

29:44.803 --> 29:47.928
Hey, that's
Mr. Takahashi's car.

29:47.928 --> 29:49.803
Who's Mr. Takahashi?

29:49.803 --> 29:52.011
What the hell
is he doing here?

29:57.761 --> 29:59.637
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my God.

29:59.637 --> 30:01.637
- Ken's wife?
- ( window whirs )

30:01.637 --> 30:04.886
This is interesting,
because I was coming
over to the car

30:04.886 --> 30:06.637
to ask you
about the letter,

30:06.637 --> 30:09.679
but, uh,
I don't think that'll
be necessary anymore.

30:09.679 --> 30:11.345
Do me a favor,

30:11.345 --> 30:12.886
will you call the club
and tell them

30:12.886 --> 30:14.720
I'm coming over
to play some golf?

30:16.137 --> 30:17.928
Okay.

30:17.928 --> 30:19.970
See you at the club.
Take care.

30:19.970 --> 30:22.470
I knew that baby
looked a little Asian.

30:22.470 --> 30:25.262
Hey, let's play
some golf.

30:25.262 --> 30:26.845
I don't know.

30:26.845 --> 30:28.303
What? No, come on.
It'll be fun.

30:28.303 --> 30:31.053
- ( sighs )
- I think the car's that way.

30:37.637 --> 30:39.928
Hello, Mr. David.
Nice to meet you.

30:39.928 --> 30:41.387
I'm Randy.
I'm new here.

30:41.387 --> 30:43.761
How are you?
I was told you'd be
heading over.

30:43.761 --> 30:44.637
Yeah.

30:46.679 --> 30:47.803
( sighs )

30:53.303 --> 30:55.761
That's how you do it.
That's how you do it.

30:55.761 --> 30:57.512
Larry:
All right, look,
you know, I got--

30:57.512 --> 30:59.595
I got clothes
in my locker
we can wear

30:59.595 --> 31:02.387
or we could just
take these jackets off.

31:02.387 --> 31:04.262
Doesn't really matter
what we're playing in.

31:06.137 --> 31:08.637
Victor:
What the fuck is this?

31:12.220 --> 31:13.387
Larry:
You all right?

31:13.387 --> 31:15.637
( muffled explosions )

31:15.637 --> 31:17.220
Victor:
Oh, fuck.
Pull over! Pull over!

31:17.220 --> 31:19.387
- 10:00. Redcoats, man.
- ( tires screech )

31:19.387 --> 31:21.679
Larry, there's
fucking redcoats, man!

31:21.679 --> 31:22.970
- You motherfuckers!
- Larry: Hey.

31:22.970 --> 31:25.095
Don't tread on me,
motherfuckers!

31:25.095 --> 31:26.720
- Come on! Yeah!
- Larry: Hey! No!

31:26.720 --> 31:28.178
It's your last day,
you bitches.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.761
- Get the fuck outta here!
- They're valets!

31:30.761 --> 31:32.928
( shouting )
Come on, man!

31:32.928 --> 31:34.928
Man:
Hey, please!
( screaming )

31:36.761 --> 31:39.011
- ( screaming continues )
- ( sighs )

31:45.220 --> 31:48.053
Hey, asshole!
Here's your mail.

31:53.886 --> 31:56.970
Welcome home, soldier.
Thank you for your service.

31:58.429 --> 32:02.095
( theme music playing )

33:19.720 --> 33:20.679
What is this, tap?

33:20.679 --> 33:21.845
-Yes it is.
-LARRY DAVID: Oh.

33:22.053 --> 33:23.512
Surprised you don't
have a filter.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.845
You have no filter.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.470
I am trying my best
to accommodate you.

33:28.470 --> 33:29.512
LARRY:
It doesn't seem like it.

33:29.512 --> 33:30.470
You're not goin' through
ruling it.

33:31.095 --> 33:32.803
You're not doing unto others
as you would have others
do unto you.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.761
Unfortunately, the golden rule
is not a federal regulation.

33:35.761 --> 33:38.886
Golden rule's on top,
federal law is second!

33:38.886 --> 33:40.387
I have to make a choice.

33:40.387 --> 33:42.178
It's either Larry David
or Marilyn.

33:42.178 --> 33:43.845
-Who'd you pick?
-I took Marilyn.

33:43.845 --> 33:45.178
I would have made
the same decision.

33:45.178 --> 33:46.928
Let's face it, at this point
in our lives, it's...

33:46.928 --> 33:49.053
not so easy to find people
to have sex with us.
