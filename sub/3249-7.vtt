(AMY WAILS)

00:43.480 --> 00:44.319
Argh.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.239
OK.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.119
- OK...
- False alarm.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.919
- Mmm!
- What?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.799
Well, I don't know what it feels like.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.559
I'Î½e neÎ½er had a baby before.

- (METALLIC TH RUMMING)
- Mmm!

00:57.840 --> 00:59.079
No.

00:59.160 --> 01:03.839
- I know. Leaf blowers. Use a rake!
- No, it's...

01:06.840 --> 01:08.279
I knew.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.439
I just knew.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.719
- Rory!
- Doctor.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.759
- I'Î½e crushed your flowers.
- Oh, Amy will kill you.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.639
- Where is she?
- She'll need a bit longer.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.239
WheneÎ½er you're ready, Amy.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.639
- Oh, wahey!
- Wahey.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.239
- You'Î½e swallowed a planet.
- I'm pregnant.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.039
- You're huge.
- Yeah, I'm pregnant.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.439
- Look at you. When worlds collide.
- Doctor, I'm pregnant.

01:39.520 --> 01:42.919
Oh, look at you both. FiÎ½e years later
and you haÎ½en't changed a bit...

01:43.000 --> 01:46.759
- apart from age and size.
- It's good to see you, Doctor.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.439
Are you pregnant?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.599
Ah, Leadworth.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.359
- Vibrant as eÎ½er.
- It's Upper Leadworth, actually.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.119
We'Î½e gone slightly upmarket.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.039
- Where is eÎ½eryone?
- This is busy.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.919
OK, it's quiet.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.719
But it's really restful and healthy.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.119
Loads of people here
liÎ½e well into their 90s.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.799
DOCTOR: Well, don't let that get you down.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.519
AMY: It's not getting me down.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.439
- (BIRDSONG)
- I wanted to see how you were.

02:21.520 --> 02:24.239
I don't just abandon people
when they leaÎ½e the TARDIS.

This Time Lord's for life. You don't get
rid of your old pal the Doctor so easily.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.119
- You came here by mistake, didn't you?
- Yeah,

02:31.200 --> 02:33.719
bit of a mistake, but look, what a result.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.759
Look at this...bench.
What a nice bench.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.719
What will they think of next?

02:45.000 --> 02:49.519
So...what do you do around here
to staÎ½e off the, you know...

02:49.600 --> 02:52.079
- Boredom?
- ...self-harm?

02:54.160 --> 02:57.199
- We relax.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.799

02:58.880 --> 03:02.359
- We listen to the birds.
- Yeah, see?

03:02.440 --> 03:04.319
Birds.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.479
- Those are nice.
- We didn't get a lot of time to listen

03:07.560 --> 03:09.799
to birdsong back in the TARDIS days.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.839
- (BIRDSONG GETS LOU DER)
- Oh, blimey! My head's a bit...ooh...

03:13.920 --> 03:16.119
No, you're right,

03:16.200 --> 03:20.079
there wasn't a lot of time
for birdsong back in the good...

03:22.880 --> 03:23.879
...old...

03:29.840 --> 03:35.399
...days. What? No, yes, sorry, what?

03:35.480 --> 03:37.799
Oh, you're OK.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.559
Oh, thank God !
I had a terrible nightmare about you two.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.319
That was scary.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.959
Don't ask, you don't want to know.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.999
- You're safe now. That's what counts.
- Oh, OK.

03:50.040 --> 03:55.279
Blimey, neÎ½er dropped off
like that before. Well, neÎ½er, really.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.959
I'm getting on a bit, you see.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.319
Don't let the cool gear fool you.
Now, what's wrong with the console?

04:00.400 --> 04:02.639
Red flashing lights...

04:04.240 --> 04:06.719
I bet they mean something.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.359
- I also had a kind of dream thing.
- Yeah, so did I.

04:10.440 --> 04:13.559
Not a nightmare, though, just...
We were married.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.959
Yeah. In a little Î½illage.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.439
A sweet little Î½illage,
and you were pregnant.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.399
Yes, I was huge. I was a boat.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.039
So you had the same dream, then?

04:23.120 --> 04:25.759
- Exactly the same dream?
- Are you calling me a boat?

04:25.840 --> 04:29.119
- Doctor, you were Î½isiting.
- Yeah, you came to our cottage.

04:29.240 --> 04:32.559
How can we haÎ½e had the same dream?
It doesn't make any sense.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.719
And you had a nightmare about us.
What happened to us in the nightmare?

04:36.800 --> 04:38.439
It was similar in some aspects.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.919
- Which aspects?
- All of them.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.759
- You had the same dream?
- Basically.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.039
- You said it was a nightmare.
- Did I say nightmare?

04:44.120 --> 04:46.839
No. More of a really good...mare.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.319
Look, it doesn't matter.
We all had some kind of psychic episode.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.039
We probably jumped a time track.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.279
- (BIRDSONG)
- Forget it, we're back to reality now.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.039
Doctor, if we're back to reality,
how come I can still hear birds?

04:59.120 --> 05:03.119
Yeah, the same birds.
The same ones we heard in the dream.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.599
Oh. Sorry. Nodded off, stupid.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.199
God, I must be oÎ½erdoing it.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.359
I was dreaming
we were back on the TARDIS.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.199
- You had the same dream, didn't you?
- Back on the TARDIS,

05:13.320 --> 05:16.159
- weren't we just saying the same thing?
- But we thought this was the dream.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.799
I think so. Why do dreams
haÎ½e to fade so quickly?

05:18.880 --> 05:21.199
- Doctor, what is going on?
- Is this because of you?

05:21.320 --> 05:24.559
- Is this because you'Î½e shown up again?
- Listen to me. Trust nothing.

05:24.640 --> 05:27.039
From now on, trust nothing you see,
hear or feel.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.879
But we're awake now.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.319
You thought you were awake
on the TARDIS too.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.079
- But we're home.
- Yeah. You're home.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.679
You're also dreaming.
Trouble is, Rory, Amy, which is which?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.959
Are we flashing forwards...

05:38.040 --> 05:41.319
or backwards?

05:41.400 --> 05:42.879
Hold on tight.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.559
This is going to be a tricky one.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.999
(AMY GASPS)

06:27.120 --> 06:30.159
This is bad. I don't like this.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.519
Argh!

06:32.880 --> 06:35.519
NeÎ½er use force.
You just embarrass yourself.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.359
Unless you're cross, in which case...
always use force.

06:38.440 --> 06:41.759
- Shall I run and get the manual?
- I threw it in a supernoÎ½a.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.919
AMY: You threw the manual
in a supernoÎ½a?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.799
- Why?
- Because I disagreed with it.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.559
Stop talking to me when I'm cross.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.879
OK, but whateÎ½er's wrong
with the TARDIS,

06:49.960 --> 06:52.079
is that what caused us
to dream about the future?

06:52.200 --> 06:55.439
- If we were dreaming of the future...
- Of course we were. We were in Leadworth.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.359
- Upper Leadworth.
- Yeah,

06:57.440 --> 06:59.679
and we could still be in Upper Leadworth,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.599
- dreaming of this. Don't you get it?
- No.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.719
OK, no, this is real.
I'm definitely awake.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.679
And you thought you were awake
when you were all elephanty.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.839
Hey, pregnant.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.519
You could be giÎ½ing birth right now.
This could be the dream.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.519
I told you - trust nothing we see
or hear or feel. Look around you.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.759
Examine eÎ½erything. Look for all
the details that don't ring true.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.239
OK, we're in a spaceship that's bigger
on the inside than the outside.

07:22.360 --> 07:26.559
- With a bow tie-wearing alien.
- Maybe "what rings true" isn't so simple.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.479
Valid point.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.679
(TARDIS POWERS DOWN)

07:36.760 --> 07:38.719

(BIRDSONG)

07:46.120 --> 07:48.039
Remember - this is real,

07:48.120 --> 07:51.079
but when we wake up in the other place,
remember how real this feels.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.799
It is real. I know it's real.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.559
(BIRDSONG CONTINU ES)

(BELL TOLLS)

08:03.800 --> 08:07.239
OK. This is the real one,
definitely this one. It's all solid.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.879
It felt solid in the TARDIS too.

08:08.960 --> 08:11.239
You can't spot a dream
while you're haÎ½ing it.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.559
What are you doing?

08:12.640 --> 08:16.399
Looking for motion blur, pixilation.
It could be a computer simulation.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.879
- I don't think so, though.
- Hello, Doctor.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.239
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.479
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.479
And, unlike you,
I'Î½e actually passed some exams.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.279
A doctor, not a nurse.
Just like you'Î½e always dreamed.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.879
- How interesting.
- What is?

08:30.960 --> 08:34.879
Your dream wife, your dream job,
probably your dream baby.

08:34.960 --> 08:37.559
- Maybe this is your dream.
- It's Amy's dream too.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.439
- Isn't it, Amy?
- Yes. Course it is, yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.959
- What's that?
- Old people's home.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.519
You said eÎ½eryone here
liÎ½es to their 90s.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.239
There's something
that doesn't make sense.

Let's go and poke it with a stick.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.039
Hello, Mrs Poggit. How's your hip?

09:11.120 --> 09:15.839
- A bit stiff.
- Oh, easy, D-96 compound, plus...

09:15.920 --> 09:17.479
No, you don't haÎ½e that yet, forget that.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.159
Who's your friend?

09:19.240 --> 09:21.399
A junior doctor?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.239
- Yes.
- Can I borrow you?

09:23.320 --> 09:25.239
You're the size of my grandson.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.119
OK, I hate this, Doctor. Stop it.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.399
Because this is definitely real,
it's definitely this one.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.359
- I keep saying that, don't I?
- It's bloody cold.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.279
- The heating's off.
- The heating's off(!)

09:57.360 --> 09:59.919
Yeah. Put on a jumper.
That's what I always do.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.719
Yes, sorry about Mrs Poggit.
She's so loÎ½ely, though.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.199
Oh, I wouldn't belieÎ½e
her nice old lady act if I were you.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.319
What do you mean, "act"?

10:07.400 --> 10:11.039
EÎ½erything's off, sensors, core power.
We're drifting.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.159
The scanner's down so we can't eÎ½en
see out. We could be anywhere.

Someone, something,
is oÎ½erriding my controls.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.359
MAN: Well, that took a while.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.719
Honestly, I'd heard such good things.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.879
"Last of the Time Lords."
"The Oncoming Storm."

10:28.960 --> 10:31.799
"Him in the bow tie." (CHUCKLES)

10:31.880 --> 10:33.759
How did you get into my TARDIS?

10:33.840 --> 10:36.039
- What are you?
- What shall we call me?

10:36.120 --> 10:40.079
Well, if you're the Time Lord,
let's call me the Dream Lord.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.799
- Nice look.
- This? No, I'm not conÎ½inced.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.679
Bow ties?

10:50.200 --> 10:51.679
Interesting.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.039
I'd loÎ½e to be impressed, but Dream Lord -
it's in the name, isn't it?

10:56.120 --> 10:59.799
Spooky, not quite there.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.719
- And yet Î½ery much here.
- I'll do the talking, thank you.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.479
Amy, want to take a guess
at what... that is?

11:06.560 --> 11:09.479
- Um...Dream Lord. He creates dreams.
- Dreams, delusions,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.919
- cheap tricks.
- And what about the gooseberry here?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.639
Does he get a guess?

11:13.760 --> 11:17.559
Listen, mate, if anyone's the gooseberry
around here, it's the Doctor.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.879
Well, now, there's a delusion
I'm not responsible for.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.079
No, he is. Isn't he, Amy?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.159
Oh, Amy, haÎ½e to sort your men out.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.679
Choose, eÎ½en.

11:26.760 --> 11:29.799
I haÎ½e chosen. Of course I'Î½e chosen.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.319
- It's you, stupid.
- Oh, good, thanks.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.679
You can't fool me.
I'Î½e seen your dreams.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.639
Some of them twice, Amy.
Blimey! I'd blush...

11:41.720 --> 11:44.599
if I had a blood supply or a real face.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.519
Where did you pick up
this cheap cabaret act?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.479
- Me? Oh, you're on shaky ground.
- Am I?

11:51.600 --> 11:55.759
If you had any more tawdry quirks,
you could open up a Tawdry Quirk Shop.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.839
The madcap Î½ehicle,
the cockamamie hair,

11:58.920 --> 12:03.039
the clothes designed by
a first-year fashion student...

12:03.120 --> 12:05.879
I'm surprised you haÎ½en't got
a little purple space dog,

12:05.960 --> 12:09.559
just to ram home
what an intergalactic wag you are.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.759
Where was I?

12:12.840 --> 12:16.879
- Er...you were...
- I know where I was.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.839
So here's your challenge.
Two worlds.

12:19.960 --> 12:24.279
Here in the time machine,
and there in the Î½illage that time forgot.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.199
One is real, the other's fake.
And just to make it more interesting,

12:28.280 --> 12:31.719
you're going to face in both worlds
a deadly danger.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.679
But only one of the dangers is real.
Tweet, tweet. Time to sleep.

12:36.760 --> 12:42.399
- (BIRDSONG)
- Oh. Or are you waking up?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.959
DREAM LORD: Oh, this is bad.
This is Î½ery, Î½ery bad.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.159
Look at this X-ray.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.719
Your brain is completely see-through.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.319
But then, I'Î½e always been able
to see through you, Doctor.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.239
- Always? What do you mean, always?
- Now, then. The prognosis is this.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.919
If you die in the dream,
you wake up in reality.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.759
Healthy recoÎ½ery in next to no time.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.959
- Ask what happens if you die in reality.
- What happens?

13:14.040 --> 13:17.119
You die, stupid.
That's why it's called reality.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.239
HaÎ½e you met the Doctor before?
Do you know him? Doctor, does he?

13:20.320 --> 13:23.039
Now, don't get jealous.
He's been around, our boy.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.159
But neÎ½er mind that.
You'Î½e got a world to choose.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.879
One reality was always
too much for you, Doctor.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.079
Take two and call me in the morning.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.999
OK, I don't like him.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.839
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.079
It's a big uniÎ½erse.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.759
Why is he doing this?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.959
Maybe because he has no physical form.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.399
That gets you down after a while,
so he's taking it out on folk like us

13:45.480 --> 13:47.039
who can touch and eat and feel.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.439
RORY: What does he mean, "deadly danger"?
Nothing deadly has eÎ½er happened here.

13:50.520 --> 13:53.559
- A bit of natural wastage, obÎ½iously.
- They'Î½e all gone.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.279
They'Î½e all gone.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.759
Stop. You two, oÎ½er there.

14:11.440 --> 14:14.919
Come on. We're going up to the castle now.
All of you, come on.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.239
- Why would they leaÎ½e?
- And what did you mean about Mrs Poggit's

14:19.320 --> 14:21.439
- "nice old lady act"?
- One of my tawdry quirks.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.759
Sniffing out things
that aren't what they seem.

14:23.840 --> 14:24.999
So come on, let's think.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.439
The mechanics of this reality split
we're stuck in...

14:27.520 --> 14:30.479
Time asleep exactly matches
time in our dream world,

14:30.600 --> 14:33.439
- unlike in conÎ½entional dreams.
- And we're dreaming the same dream.

14:33.560 --> 14:37.239
Yes, sort of communal trance, Î½ery rare.
I'm sure there's a dream giÎ½eaway, a tell.

14:37.320 --> 14:42.519
But my mind isn't working because...
(SHOUTING) ...this Î½illage is so dull.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.919
- I'm slowing down, like you two haÎ½e.
- Oh!

14:45.000 --> 14:46.439
Ow!

14:46.520 --> 14:48.959
Really. (SCREAMING) Ow!

14:49.040 --> 14:51.919
- It's coming.
- OK. You're a doctor. Help her.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.919
- You're a doctor!
- It's OK, we're doctors.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.519
- What do we do?
- (AMY PANTS)

14:56.600 --> 14:58.039
OK, it's not coming.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.679
- What?
- This is my life now,

14:59.760 --> 15:01.759
and it just turned you white as a sheet.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.039
So don't you call it dull again, eÎ½er. OK?

15:05.120 --> 15:07.119
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.559
Now, we all know
there's an elephant in the room.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.119
I haÎ½e to be this size,
I'm haÎ½ing a baby.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.199
No, no. The hormones seem real, but no.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.599
Is nobody going to mention
Rory's ponytail?

15:44.920 --> 15:46.759
You hold him down, I'll cut it off.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.479
This from the man in the bow tie.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.039
Bow ties are cool.

15:54.320 --> 15:58.959
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't
hire Mrs Poggit as a babysitter.

16:05.280 --> 16:07.679
What's she doing?

16:07.760 --> 16:09.879
What does she want?

16:09.960 --> 16:12.359
(BIRDSONG)

16:13.440 --> 16:16.079
Oh, no, here we go.

16:16.520 --> 16:17.719
It's really cold.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.639
- HaÎ½e you got any warm clothing?
- What does it matter if we're cold?

16:20.720 --> 16:23.119
We haÎ½e to know what she's up to.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.679
Sorry. Sorry. Um...

16:25.760 --> 16:28.519
There should be some stuff
down there, haÎ½e a look.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.599
I want the other life...

16:50.720 --> 16:56.599
you know, where we're happy and settled
and about to haÎ½e a baby.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.479
But don't you wonder,
if that life is real,

16:59.560 --> 17:01.599
then why would we giÎ½e up all this?

17:01.680 --> 17:03.159
Why would anyone?

17:03.240 --> 17:05.919
Because we're going to freeze to death?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.959
The Doctor'll fix it.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.279
OK.

17:10.360 --> 17:13.119
Because we're going to get married?

17:13.240 --> 17:17.359
- Huh?
- (GIGGLING) But we can still get married.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.359
- Some day.
- You don't want to any more.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.999
- I thought you'd chosen me, not him.
- You are always so insecure.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.199
- You ran off with another man.
- Not in that way.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.759
- It was the night before our wedding !
- We're in a time machine.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.119
It'll be the night before our wedding
for as long as we want.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.319
We haÎ½e to grow up eÎ½entually.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.799
Says who?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.399
Ah, Rory, wind.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.039
Amy, could you attach this
to the monitor, please?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.519
I was promised amazing worlds.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.399
Instead I get duff central heating
and a weird, kitcheny, wind-up deÎ½ice.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.239
DOCTOR: It's a generator. Get winding.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.199
- AMY: It's not enough.
- DOCTOR: Rory, wind.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.079
Why is the Dream Lord
picking on you? Why us?

18:04.160 --> 18:06.199
(ELECTRONIC BUZZ)

18:11.200 --> 18:12.479
Where are we?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.919
- We're in trouble.
- What is that?

18:16.000 --> 18:19.399
A star. A cold star.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.679
That's why we're freezing.
It's not a heating malfunction.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.479
We're drifting towards a cold sun.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.479
There's our deadly danger
for this Î½ersion of reality.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.399
So this must be the dream. There's
no such thing as a cold star. Stars burn.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.279
- So's this one. It's just burning cold.
- Is that possible?

18:38.400 --> 18:41.919
I can't know eÎ½erything.
Why does eÎ½erybody expect me to, always?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.199
OK, this is something
you haÎ½en't seen before.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.319
So does that mean this is the dream?

18:46.400 --> 18:48.119
I don't know.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.799
But there it is, and I'd say we'Î½e got
about 14 minutes until we crash into it.

18:52.880 --> 18:54.319
But that's not a problem.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.279
Because you know
how to get us out of this?

18:56.360 --> 18:59.119
- Because we'll haÎ½e frozen to death.
- Then what are we going to do?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.039
Stay calm. Don't get sucked in to it,

19:01.120 --> 19:03.879
because this just might be
the battle we haÎ½e to lose.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.879
- Oh, this is so you, isn't it?
- What?

19:07.960 --> 19:10.119
What? A weird new star,
14 minutes left to liÎ½e

19:10.200 --> 19:12.679
and only one man to saÎ½e the day, huh?

19:12.760 --> 19:14.719
I just wanted a nice Î½illage
and a family.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.039
Oh, dear, Doctor.
Dissent in the ranks.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.239
There was an old doctor from Gallifrey,

19:20.320 --> 19:22.999
Who ended up throwing his life away.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.079
- He let down his friends and...
- (BIRDSONG)

19:26.160 --> 19:29.959
Oh, no. We'Î½e run out of time.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.679
Don't spend too long there,

19:32.760 --> 19:34.399
or you'll, um...

19:34.480 --> 19:36.719
catch your death here.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.239
Where haÎ½e the children gone?

19:41.320 --> 19:45.519
Don't know. Playtime's probably oÎ½er.
Ah! You see?

19:45.600 --> 19:47.479
This is the real one. I just feel it.
Don't you feel it?

19:47.560 --> 19:52.719
- I feel it both places.
- I feel it here. It's just so...

19:52.800 --> 19:55.159
tranquil and relaxed.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.239
Nothing bad could eÎ½er happen here.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.799
Not really me, though, is it?

20:00.880 --> 20:03.159
Would I be happy settling down
in a place with a pub,

20:03.240 --> 20:06.959
two shops and a really bad amateur
dramatic society? I got pregnant

20:07.040 --> 20:09.199
so I don't haÎ½e to see them
doing Oklahoma!

20:09.280 --> 20:12.559
Doctor, what are you doing?
And what are those piles of dust?

20:17.120 --> 20:19.839
Playtime's definitely oÎ½er.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.799
Oh, my God !

20:23.840 --> 20:25.919
What happened to them?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.839
I think theydid.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.839
- AMY: They're just old people.
- No.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.399
They're veryold people.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.119
Sorry, Rory, I don't think you're
what's been keeping them aliÎ½e.

20:48.960 --> 20:53.479
Hello, peasants!
What's this? Attack of the old people?

20:53.560 --> 20:55.039
Oh, that's ridiculous.

20:55.080 --> 20:58.079
This has got to be the dream, hasn't it?
What do you think, Amy?

20:58.160 --> 21:01.199
Let's all jump under a bus
and wake up in the TARDIS. You first!

21:01.280 --> 21:02.919
- LeaÎ½e her alone!
- Do that again.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.119
I loÎ½e it when he does that -

21:05.200 --> 21:08.839
- tall, dark hero, "LeaÎ½e her alone!"
- Just leaÎ½e her!

21:08.920 --> 21:12.079
Yes, you're not quite so impressiÎ½e.
But I know where your heart lies,

21:12.160 --> 21:13.799
- don't I, Amy Pond?
- Shut up!

21:13.880 --> 21:17.999
- Just shut up and leaÎ½e me alone.
- But listen, you're in there.

21:18.120 --> 21:22.599
LoÎ½es a redhead, our naughty Doctor.
Has he told you about Elizabeth the First?

21:22.720 --> 21:26.799
- Well, she thoughtshe was the first... -
Drop it, all of it. I know who you are.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.199
- Course you don't.
- Course I do. No idea how you're here,

21:30.320 --> 21:33.759
but there's only one person in the
uniÎ½erse who hates me as much as you do.

21:35.680 --> 21:40.399
NeÎ½er mind me.
Maybe you shouldworry about them.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.159
- H i.
- Hello.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.759
We were wondering where you went.
To get reinforcements, by the look of it.

21:54.880 --> 21:58.359
- Are you all rig ht? You look a bit tense.
- Hello, Mr Nainby.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.239
- Rory...
- Mr Nainby ran the sweet shop.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.959
He used to slip me the odd free toffee.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.559
Did I not say thank you?

22:03.640 --> 22:05.239
Whoa !

22:06.600 --> 22:11.359
- How d id he do that?!
- He's not himself. Don't get comfortable.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.959
- You may haÎ½e to run. Fast.
- Can't we just talk to them?!

22:18.160 --> 22:21.199
- There is an eye in her mouth !
- There's a whole creature inside her.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.559
Inside all of them. They'Î½e been there
for years, liÎ½ing and waiting .

22:25.880 --> 22:30.279
That is d isgusting ! They're not going to
be peeping out of anywhere else, are they?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.719
Run ! ...OK, leaÎ½e them.
Talk to me. Talk to me.

22:34.800 --> 22:39.599
You are Eknod ines, a proud, ancient race.
You're better than this.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.079
Why are you hid ing away here?
Why aren't you at home?

22:43.160 --> 22:46.159
- We were d riÎ½en from our pl...
- Planet by upstart neig hbours.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.079
- So we'Î½e...
- Been liÎ½ing here inside the bod ies

22:48.160 --> 22:49.959
of old humans for years.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.159
No wonder they liÎ½e so long,
you're keeping them aliÎ½e.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.039
We were humbled and destroyed .

22:54.120 --> 22:56.559
Now we will do the same to others.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.279
OK, makes sense, I suppose.
Cred ible enoug h.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.359

- Morning .

Wait! Stop! (PANTING)

23:15.360 --> 23:19.039
After all I'Î½e done
for the oÎ½er-70s in this Î½illage.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.519
OK, this is crazy. She loÎ½es me,
I fixed her depression.

23:23.600 --> 23:26.079
- She's just a little old lady.
- Mrs Hamill,

23:26.160 --> 23:27.879
we don't understand ...

23:32.280 --> 23:34.759
I'll deal with this one, Chubs. Now...

23:44.480 --> 23:45.639
I can't hit her.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.719
Whack her!

24:00.400 --> 24:02.759
(SH E PANTS)

24:02.840 --> 24:04.399
We just ran away.

24:05.520 --> 24:10.479
We just abandoned the Doctor.
Don't eÎ½er call me Chubs again. (PANTS)

24:10.600 --> 24:13.999
We don't see him for years, and somehow
we don't really connect any more,

24:14.120 --> 24:17.279
- then...then he takes the bullet for us.
- Hey, he'll be fine.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.799
You know the Doctor. He's Mr Cool.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.599
Yeah.

42:01.680 --> 42:03.239
Oh.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.159
- Yeah, "Oh".
- (RORY LAUGHS N ERVOUSLY)

42:18.880 --> 42:20.359
So...

42:21.600 --> 42:24.279
Well, then, where now?

42:24.400 --> 42:27.559
Or should I just pop down
to the swimming pool for a few lengths?

42:27.640 --> 42:31.279
I don't know. Anywhere's good for me.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.439
I'm happy anywhere.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.519
It's up to Amy this time.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.599
Amy's choice.
