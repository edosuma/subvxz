WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.931
Meow.

00:15.056 --> 00:17.475
[Claire panting]

00:17.892 --> 00:18.810
[gasps]

00:19.144 --> 00:21.479
-[Merlin] Hullgar!
-[Claire screams]

00:21.771 --> 00:23.356
-[Claire] Jim!
-[Jim yells]

00:23.440 --> 00:26.025
[Claire panting]

00:26.317 --> 00:27.944
[Jim grunts]

00:28.027 --> 00:30.155
-Jim!
-Why didn't you help me?

00:31.072 --> 00:33.074
[grunting]

00:33.158 --> 00:34.534
[Claire] No, no, no, no, no!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.077
[Morgana screams]

00:37.037 --> 00:38.204
Gotcha!

00:38.955 --> 00:41.583
-[gasps]
-[screams]

00:42.584 --> 00:43.418
[gasps]

00:44.294 --> 00:45.378
It wasn't real.

00:45.545 --> 00:46.796
It wasn't real.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.677
Oh, no!

00:52.761 --> 00:55.013
[Douxie whistling]

00:55.096 --> 00:56.639
[theme music playing]

01:24.667 --> 01:27.087
-[indistinct chatter]
-How will Arthur protect us?

01:27.670 --> 01:30.423
-Excalibur shattered.
-[man 1] I didn't know!

01:32.133 --> 01:33.551
Drink this, my lord.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.012
It will make you feel better.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.265
[grunts] Oh, sister.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.309
You must rally, Your Grace.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.353
The realm needs you.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.771
We all do.

01:49.859 --> 01:50.777
[gasps]

01:50.860 --> 01:54.197
My sword, shattered, like my kingdom.

01:54.739 --> 01:56.616
All is in ruins.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.787
I will repair Excalibur

02:00.870 --> 02:04.833
and perhaps mend our shattered hearts.

02:05.542 --> 02:09.838
Excalibur is busted
and Morgana is... is...

02:10.588 --> 02:12.549
This never was supposed to happen.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.093
[Archie] You did what you thought
was right.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.639
And look where that got us.
History's absolutely botched.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.474
I've led us astray.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.393
Morgana tried to help me save Jim,

02:23.726 --> 02:27.021
but all I saw was anger and darkness.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.065
We share the same magic.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.484
-What does that say about me?
-[Steve whimpers]

02:31.693 --> 02:34.529
-[cries]
-Aw, Steve.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.030
It's okay to cry.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.198
It was a big loss.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.533
[wails]

02:38.616 --> 02:42.579
It's just, the other knights
think I'm lame!

02:43.329 --> 02:45.456
They laughed at me.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.919
Said I hadn't proved my worth
as a knight. [sniffles]

02:50.003 --> 02:52.630
-And Galahad called me a weenie.
-Ugh!

02:52.714 --> 02:55.174
That doesn't sound
like a real problem, Steve.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.218
Camelot is in chaos

02:57.302 --> 03:00.680
and Arthur is without
his blessed weapon to defend it.

03:01.055 --> 03:03.016
See? That's a real problem.

03:03.099 --> 03:05.810
What's the big deal?
Can't he just buy a new one?

03:05.894 --> 03:10.648
Without Excalibur, Arthur cannot lead
Camelot to war against Gunmar.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.152
-Which would mean the end of humanity.
-And our future.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.363
-I'll never get us home.
-And I'll never save Jim.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.489
But we can fix this.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.451
-Right, Douxie?
-There's only one who can.

03:21.534 --> 03:25.204
Make ready. I must bring Excalibur
to the Lady of the Lake.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.122
[Claire] She's real?

03:26.205 --> 03:28.207
So, this plan of yours...

03:28.291 --> 03:29.918
Well, surely you'll need help.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.337
Maybe... Maybe we can fix this together.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.839
-Agreed.
-I promise I can make it righ--

03:34.923 --> 03:35.840
Wait, we are?

03:36.007 --> 03:37.091
Oh, great!

03:37.175 --> 03:39.093
-Well, we won't let you down.
-[groans]

03:39.177 --> 03:40.970
You, mind the workshop.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.431
You, gather up Excalibur.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.476
-We ride.
-Sounds like a quest!

03:46.559 --> 03:49.062
Chance to prove I'm an awesome knight,
get a monster trophy,

03:49.145 --> 03:50.605
save the damsel, I'm in!

03:52.607 --> 03:56.236
-Do you think Merlin's plan will work?
-I messed up the timelines.

03:56.319 --> 04:01.866
We've run out of options, and my choices
haven't exactly worked out lately.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.953
We can't make any more mistakes.

04:05.036 --> 04:08.873
-We'll have to trust Merlin this time.
-I just hope Jim made it out safe.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.001
[Douxie] I'm sure he's nestled safely
in the bosom of friendly Trolls.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.962
[Steve chuckles] Bosom.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.089
Blink? Oh.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.925
-I just had the craziest dream.
-[Blinky] Did you, now?

04:19.008 --> 04:22.887
I was stuck in the past!
And Steve had great hair and a goatee.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.391
Everything smelled bad,
and-- and Gunmar was still alive.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.768
Gunmar the Black is very much alive.

04:28.851 --> 04:30.103
Clearly, he's delusional.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.604
-Snap out of it!
-[grunts] Ow!

04:31.813 --> 04:32.981
[grunting]

04:33.064 --> 04:34.607
Blinky, it's me, Jim!

04:34.691 --> 04:36.818
"Blinky"? For the last time,

04:36.901 --> 04:40.363
that's Blinkous Galadrigal to you,
outsider.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.031
And my nightmare's real.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.908
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.493
Forgive my brother.

04:45.576 --> 04:49.914
Your traveling companion
was a little more hostile upon waking up.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.666
I startle easy. That's on you.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.626
Of course you're here.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.838
Whenever there's calamity,
there's Callista.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.466
[Jim] Whoa. Where am I?

05:00.550 --> 05:03.678
[Dictatious] Dwoza, safe haven
for Trollkind.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.722
[Callista] You mean some of Trollkind.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.224
How do you feel? Can you walk?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.852
We did our best to heal your wounds.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.729
-[Jim] I think so?
-Superb!

05:12.812 --> 05:14.856
-Then you'll be able to leave.
-Hey, hey, watch it!

05:14.939 --> 05:16.524
You have plenty more eyes to punch.

05:16.607 --> 05:20.611
Unfortunately, you outsiders
have a habit of making things, um...

05:21.154 --> 05:22.071
not safe.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.824
Which means we've no room
for troublemakers here!

05:24.907 --> 05:26.326
What happened to "safe haven"?

05:32.206 --> 05:34.542
Ah, if you've learned anything
from Morgana,

05:34.625 --> 05:38.296
it should be that shadow magic
leads only to pain.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.341
I try to avoid water.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.886
Personally, I always pack my swimsuit.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.388
Extra-personally,
it's actually my birthday suit.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.556
Ugh! Oof.

05:48.639 --> 05:52.060
Whoa, it's a ship graveyard.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.353
-[Merlin] We've arrived.
-[Claire] Huh.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.482
The Lady of the Lake is real!
I thought she was just a myth.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.776
[Douxie] Oh, no,
the Lady's very much real.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.154
Though, only Merlin's allowed
to meet with her... till now.

06:03.237 --> 06:07.158
[Merlin] Because her power
is beyond your comprehension.

06:07.241 --> 06:12.622
It was from her mystic waters
I helped Arthur first retrieve Excalibur

06:12.705 --> 06:14.582
and unite the kingdom.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.876
Hisirdoux, the sword please.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.087
Yeah! Quest, quest, quest, quest!

06:19.170 --> 06:21.881
Watch the ship. I shall return shortly.

06:21.964 --> 06:23.633
What? We have to wait in the car?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.927
But I thought we were doing this together.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.678
You should be thanking me.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.305
I got you out of Camelot.

06:29.388 --> 06:32.433
Arthur's unstable
and the people are afraid.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.727
-I thought you trusted me.
-Ugh.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.188
I won't just sit here
without making things right!

06:37.271 --> 06:39.982
And I will not lose another apprentice!

06:40.066 --> 06:42.777
[echoes]

06:43.444 --> 06:45.154
[grumbles]

06:47.865 --> 06:52.578
-Who dares to disturb my slumb--
-It's me, Merlin.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.996
Open up, you idiots.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.582
Oh, it is you! All right, walk in.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.796
[exhales, grunts]

07:03.589 --> 07:04.632
Lake's closed!

07:04.715 --> 07:06.843
None but the master wizard shall pass.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.637
No amateurs. That's you.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.973
<i>Causa crepitoose!</i>

07:14.183 --> 07:16.519
[chuckles] Is that all you got, punk?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.772
Come on, get close
so I can bite your legs off!

07:19.897 --> 07:22.692
-Ugh! Merlin's magic is so annoying.
-[sighs]

07:22.942 --> 07:26.070
The talking door is right.
This sorcery's uncrackable.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.948
Well, at least we don't have to see
Steve's birthday suit.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.408
[Steve] Too late! Whoo!

07:30.491 --> 07:32.368
-[Latch groans]
-[Lock] Oh, no! My eyes!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.745
[Latch] Oh, I can't unsee that now!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.502
[Gunmar] You hold back,
General Aaarrrgghh.

07:41.586 --> 07:46.132
-[Aaarrrgghh roars]
-[Gunmar roars] Show me your strength!

07:46.215 --> 07:49.969
-Show me the nightmare that mankind fear!
-[grunts]

07:50.052 --> 07:52.597
[yells]

07:53.097 --> 07:54.265
-[Aaarrrgghh growls]
-[grunts]

07:55.600 --> 07:58.269
-[grunts]
-[yells]

07:59.353 --> 08:00.480
[Gunmar grunts]

08:02.023 --> 08:03.858
Good spar, Skullcrusher.

08:03.941 --> 08:07.820
Yes, old friend,
but you have yet to take me down.

08:07.904 --> 08:12.200
Gunmar, Arthur and his forces
crossed Killahead.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.869
They're hunting Trolls fleeing to Dwoza.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.454
Bular is missing.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.414
-[Gunmar grunts]
-[screams]

08:20.124 --> 08:22.460
Always killing the messenger.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.129
Then the humans crave war.

08:25.379 --> 08:29.550
General, tell the Dwoza Trolls
it's time to pick a side.

08:29.634 --> 08:32.678
And if it isn't ours, kill them all.

08:32.762 --> 08:34.597
Yes, Skullcrusher.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.265
With pleasure.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.771
Thanks, Archie.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.899
Jeez, how long is Coach Wizard gonna take?

08:45.149 --> 08:47.026
It's been forever!

08:47.109 --> 08:49.111
What if the old man needs our help?

08:49.278 --> 08:51.781
[yells]

08:51.864 --> 08:53.032
[screams]

08:53.282 --> 08:56.118
-Uh...
-Uh, Open Sesame! Abracadabra!

08:56.577 --> 08:58.913
-I'm begging you, man!
-[cackles]

08:58.996 --> 09:03.125
-Hey, door dorks, open up!
-[Latch scoffs] Why don't you open up?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.835
Maybe I will!

09:05.503 --> 09:08.130
So, I'm-- I'm really scared
that I won't be a good knight.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.883
Well, you won't be,
but don't be scared about it.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.221
You know, then you worry about, like,
what is your purpose on this planet?

09:16.597 --> 09:19.517
Merlin doesn't know shadow magic.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.647
Claire! You could make a shadow portal
and slip us right through!

09:27.316 --> 09:28.317
I don't know, Douxie.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.112
-I don't have my staff.
-I've seen you do magic without it.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.989
-But Merlin said--
-Merlin's not here.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.032
I don't wanna become her!

09:35.741 --> 09:36.701
[Claire sighs]

09:42.748 --> 09:44.041
Mm. [sighs]

09:45.501 --> 09:48.921
What if the darkness takes over,
like Morgana?

09:49.005 --> 09:52.550
Claire, look, I know you're scared,
but you're not her.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.677
You can make the magic your own.

09:56.137 --> 10:00.725
I never had the gift for shadowmancy,
but you do.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.977
You can do great and wondrous things.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.604
I've seen it.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.690
[sighs]

10:08.482 --> 10:10.610
Okay, Douxie, I'll try.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.903
But I need you walk me
through the spell book, Teach.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.572
I don't speak Wizard-ese.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.742
You want me to teach?
I'm not even a good student.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.243
-You've got that right.
-The worst!

10:19.327 --> 10:21.037
-Quit it!
-Who asked you, knobhead?

10:21.120 --> 10:23.372
-Why are we yelling?
-[chuckles]

10:23.456 --> 10:24.457
Right.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.214
Put your hands out like this.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.927
Beyond there is your destination,
your emotional anchor.

10:37.011 --> 10:41.057
-Got it.
-Then pull the magic around you.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.893
It will be your door to the Shadow Realm.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.981
-That's it, that's it. Steady.
-[pants]

10:50.775 --> 10:51.901
Claire.

10:53.944 --> 10:54.945
Focus.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.698
Eyes on point, mind on anchor.

10:57.782 --> 10:58.616
You got this.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.537
[exhales]

11:03.746 --> 11:04.997
[pants]

11:05.081 --> 11:06.207
I'm scared.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.709
Magic is emotion.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.879
Don't let fear control you. Use it!

11:11.962 --> 11:13.547
Stay true to yourself.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.966
That will protect you from the shadows.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.303
-Uh, Doux?
-Don't be afraid, Claire.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.473
-This is your magic. You can control it.
-[screams]

11:22.556 --> 11:24.975
-[Douxie] Keep your eyes on point.
-No!

11:25.601 --> 11:26.852
-No!
-[cackling]

11:26.936 --> 11:29.188
[grunts, screams]

11:30.064 --> 11:32.775
-[both] Claire!
-[panting]

11:32.858 --> 11:35.111
Doux, how do we bring her back?

11:35.194 --> 11:37.113
Hold on. I can figure this out.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.697
-It's gonna be fine.
-Fine?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.950
Shadows just ate her alive, man!

11:41.033 --> 11:42.284
What are we gonna do?

11:48.499 --> 11:51.293
Whoa! It actually worked!

11:52.128 --> 11:53.254
Kind of.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.842
Morgana...

11:58.509 --> 11:59.844
I'm so sorry.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.433
[gasps]

12:11.439 --> 12:12.565
[gasps]

12:12.982 --> 12:15.860
[Douxie] I know you're scared,
but you're not her.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.404
Don't let fear control you.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.948
Stay, stay true to yourself.

12:21.031 --> 12:25.911
-Fear won't control me! [grunts]
-[Archie] Are you hurt?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.956
-Claire! Claire, are you all right?
-Give her some space.

12:29.039 --> 12:32.376
I saw her-- a vision of Morgana.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.253
Oh, hot dang.

12:34.336 --> 12:35.296
Was it really her?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.631
Or was it guilt, or fear, or--

12:37.715 --> 12:40.593
The Shadow Realm is a place of mystery.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.596
We understand
if you don't want to go back in.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.639
No, it's okay.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.475
I'll be all right.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.269
Thanks for talking me through it, Teach.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.647
-No way this works, witchy!
-[Lock] True.

12:53.856 --> 12:56.734
-Not your fault your teacher's a dunce.
-[Douxie] There is your anchor.

12:56.817 --> 12:59.111
[Latch and Lock chuckling]

12:59.445 --> 13:02.364
-Let go of the fear.
-[Latch] No, no, don't do that.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.618
Uh, no, no, no! Not good!

13:06.744 --> 13:07.786
[grunts]

13:07.870 --> 13:10.039
[Latch] Bad, bad idea!

13:10.498 --> 13:12.208
[yells]

13:12.291 --> 13:13.417
[Douxie] Yes, yes, yes!

13:13.501 --> 13:15.294
-Claire, you did it!
-Yes!

13:15.377 --> 13:18.005
That's what I'm talking about!
Shadow Magic!

13:18.088 --> 13:21.008
-Whoo-hoo! [chuckles]
-[Latch] Uh, it didn't work.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.885
Wow, she picked that up fast.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.095
She had a stellar teacher.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.597
What are we standing 'round for?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.308
That magical sword won't repair itself.
Let's go!

13:29.391 --> 13:31.519
-To the Lady!
-Gentlemen, after you.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.812
Oh, this will be your doom!

13:33.896 --> 13:35.648
See you later, door dork!

13:35.731 --> 13:38.150
[whimpers] Feels weird, like cold pudding.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.236
That's cheating, fools!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.112
Don't leave us alone.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.490
Oh, shut up! You're not alone!

13:45.366 --> 13:48.953
Blink, Dictatious, we're on the same side!

13:49.036 --> 13:52.039
-I'll show you! See?
-I see nothing.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.583
Why do you keep pretending
we know each other?

13:54.667 --> 13:57.419
Blinkous, do you recognize this youngling?

13:57.503 --> 14:00.130
-Whoa, what's all this?
-[troll] Come on, come on! Hurry!

14:00.214 --> 14:02.383
[Dictatious] Preparations
for the end times.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.218
Once we've gathered enough supplies,

14:04.301 --> 14:08.347
we will bravely and heroically
hide underground

14:08.430 --> 14:10.432
until this dreadful conflict blows over.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.226
-Don't mind-- Ow!
-And you're not invited!

14:12.309 --> 14:14.186
Wait, you're not going to fight?

14:14.478 --> 14:17.147
But you have to!
There's a war coming and you're in it!

14:17.231 --> 14:21.318
Who are you to tell Blinkous Galadrigal
when to skirmish?

14:21.402 --> 14:24.697
You're a master strategist,
the smartest Troll I know!

14:24.780 --> 14:27.908
-Ha! The books are my brother's specialty.
-No, listen!

14:28.117 --> 14:29.952
Gunmar's going to attack Killahead.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.662
You're supposed to help the humans fight!

14:31.745 --> 14:35.875
[chuckles] I didn't realize
he's a court jester, too.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.711
But it's history! It has to happen!

14:38.794 --> 14:40.838
-That's what makes it history!
-Where are you going?

14:40.921 --> 14:43.883
Oh, we won't be long.
Just need to dispose of the rubbish.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.842
Whatever.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.177
You can't keep your heads
in the sand forever.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.638
Sooner or later,
you'll have to pick a side.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.808
Yes, well, we will look forward to that.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.560
We hope you enjoyed your stay in Dwoza.

14:54.643 --> 14:56.437
I've stayed in outhouses that were better!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.981
-[roars]
-[Dictatious whimpers]

14:59.064 --> 15:01.901
The Gumm-Gumms have arrived!
It's the end times!

15:01.984 --> 15:04.194
-Close the gates!
-Whatever.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.822
-Not yet, you idiot!
-[screams] Let me in!

15:06.906 --> 15:11.827
-I'm too young to die! [sobs]
-The Galadrigal line must survive!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.412
Brother, we're doomed.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.956
[Blinky screams]

15:19.168 --> 15:20.711
Aaarrrgghh bring message.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.589
Join Gunmar or die.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.382
[screaming]

15:27.051 --> 15:28.344
-[Steve screams]
-We made it!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.887
Thanks to you.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.764
[grunts, sniffs] Ugh!

15:31.847 --> 15:34.558
This lake stinks like butt thunder!

15:34.767 --> 15:36.685
[echoes]

15:36.769 --> 15:38.062
[sniffs] Ugh.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.105
I'd say we've arrived.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.858
-Yeah, but where's Merlin?
-Gah!

15:44.860 --> 15:46.862
Uh, he can handle himself.

15:47.529 --> 15:51.158
Let's just stick to the plan
and find the Lady.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.536
And everything will be fine.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.833
What the...?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
[screams, whimpers]

16:03.295 --> 16:04.880
[whimpers]

16:09.176 --> 16:11.762
[whispers] Come on, Steve.
Get it together.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.555
Knights don't scare.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.642
[Steve whimpers]

16:22.147 --> 16:24.525
It's... it's her!

16:25.818 --> 16:30.614
I am the Lady, Nimue, Eldest of Oracles.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.658
Why do you seek me?

16:32.866 --> 16:35.119
Okay, everyone,
just be nice to the goddess.

16:35.202 --> 16:36.036
I'll sort this.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.666
[clears throat] Oh, mighty Lake Lady...

16:40.749 --> 16:42.793
we are here to request your aid.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.337
And we're missing an old wizard,
if you've seen one.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.382
[Nimue] I can give you what you seek.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.594
Only you can help us on our quest

16:52.678 --> 16:56.015
to fix Excalibur and save Camelot.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.350
[chuckles]

16:58.434 --> 17:01.687
[Nimue] That is not
which you truly desire.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.941
You seek redemption from a scorned mentor.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.402
Escape from guilt.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.697
-Validation of knighthood.
-What?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.699
And you seek...

17:13.782 --> 17:15.576
roasted salmon?

17:15.659 --> 17:16.535
Guilty.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.162
What? Come on, Arch!

17:18.245 --> 17:22.916
[Nimue] You are not the first
to try and deceive me.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.795
[distorted voice] You are not worthy!

17:26.920 --> 17:29.214
Uh, guys...

17:29.298 --> 17:31.800
Uh, Mr. Magic Man?

17:32.259 --> 17:35.554
-[screams]
-That is no lady!

17:35.763 --> 17:38.807
[Nimue] You seek, you take,

17:38.891 --> 17:43.812
and all receive their final reward.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.898
Time to prove my knightly skills.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.692
I'll protect thou-- thee.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.611
Uh, huzzah!

17:50.861 --> 17:53.864
-Huh? [screaming]
-[Nimue roaring]

17:54.198 --> 17:56.575
-[gasps]
-[screaming continues]

17:56.658 --> 17:57.701
[both] Steve!

17:57.951 --> 18:01.205
[Nimue] Now, onto your rewards.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.122
[screams]

18:02.956 --> 18:05.834
Let me out! Let me out, man! [grunts]

18:05.918 --> 18:08.087
[whimpers] The talking door was right!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.422
[sobs] I'm not-- I'm not a knight!

18:11.131 --> 18:12.424
I'm just...

18:12.508 --> 18:13.592
fish food!

18:13.675 --> 18:16.136
-[Merlin grumbles, grunts]
-[sobbing]

18:16.220 --> 18:22.101
[screaming]

18:22.184 --> 18:23.769
Oh, hey, Merl. Good to see you.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.897
-What are you doing down here?
-I was negotiating!

18:26.980 --> 18:30.067
But if you're here, then... Hisirdoux!

18:30.150 --> 18:35.531
[Nimue] Such puny creatures
make tasty meals.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.698
-[grunting]
-[screams]

18:36.782 --> 18:37.950
[Nimue roars]

18:40.077 --> 18:43.664
I hate to say it, but perhaps
we should've stayed in the ship!

18:44.748 --> 18:45.999
[Nimue yells]

18:48.252 --> 18:51.171
We need to subdue her
so she'll fix Excalibur!

18:51.255 --> 18:54.842
We need to get Steve
out of this seaside freak show!

18:55.259 --> 18:56.760
-[Douxie grunts]
-[Nimue roars]

18:58.137 --> 18:59.429
[grunting]

19:04.226 --> 19:05.185
[Claire and Douxie grunt]

19:05.811 --> 19:08.105
Oh, fuzz buckets.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.650
[roars, screeches]

19:12.151 --> 19:14.695
You've been a very bad Lake Lady!

19:16.947 --> 19:18.907
-[Nimue grunts]
-[Steve screaming]

19:18.991 --> 19:20.325
-[Merlin grunts]
-Oh!

19:20.409 --> 19:22.327
Hey, I-- I did it.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.788
I'm a hero.

19:25.205 --> 19:30.836
My revenge tasted so sweet.

19:30.919 --> 19:33.463
Wait, revenge? What revenge?

19:33.547 --> 19:35.632
You attacked us, lady!

19:35.716 --> 19:39.178
Long ago, I gave him the blade,

19:39.261 --> 19:43.640
but he imprisoned me here in this cave
without hope.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.185
Wait, Merlin trapped you here?

19:46.268 --> 19:49.646
[growls] Now my prison will be your tomb.

19:49.730 --> 19:53.358
Take her down, man,
or we're all gonna get dead!

19:53.525 --> 19:55.736
[Archie] But who'll repair Excalibur,
Douxie?

19:55.819 --> 19:57.321
[Claire] Well, she's not going to!

19:57.821 --> 19:59.323
What do we do, Douxie?

20:02.910 --> 20:06.288
<i>Tenebris exilium!</i>

20:08.415 --> 20:11.752
-Wait, you let that tentacle lady bounce?
-And destroyed Excalibur?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.886
What are you waiting for? Just go!

20:23.388 --> 20:25.682
I may not know how to fix this...

20:26.016 --> 20:29.478
[sighs] but I do know that you shouldn't
be stuck in here.

20:29.853 --> 20:31.355
[Nimue] You are...

20:31.438 --> 20:32.689
different.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.900
You are kind.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.656
This gift must be repaid.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.993
The sword was meant for those worthy.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.578
Do good with it.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.414
I shall return it to its rightful place.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.875
Thank you, Scary Monster Lake Lady.

20:51.959 --> 20:52.834
Good-bye!

20:53.043 --> 20:56.088
Sorry I almost slayed you, Monster Lady!

20:56.255 --> 20:58.966
[coughing] Hisirdoux, what have you done?

20:59.049 --> 21:00.217
Uh... oh.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.301
Is that Excalibur?

21:01.718 --> 21:02.719
Indeed.

21:02.886 --> 21:05.973
I've resecured Camelot's stability,
just as you'd planned.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.266
Ah.

21:07.349 --> 21:12.187
We must return to Camelot, where we will
discuss your blunders later.

21:12.479 --> 21:13.522
Nice work, Teach.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.191
And I got a monster trophy! Whoo!

21:16.275 --> 21:17.234
Quest!

21:25.409 --> 21:26.910
Poor girl.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.335
Rest in peace, young one.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.588
May the spirits guide you home.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.676
[sniffing]

21:44.761 --> 21:47.055
[sniffs] Ugh.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.309
[Bellroc] Death.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.060
Disgusting.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.150
Your time is not done.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.489
[screams]

22:04.948 --> 22:06.325
[screams]

22:08.618 --> 22:09.870
[screams]

22:10.829 --> 22:12.080
[exhales]

22:13.665 --> 22:14.499
Why?

22:14.666 --> 22:19.921
[Bellroc] Because you will be
our champion.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.302
[instrumental music playing]
