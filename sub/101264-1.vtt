01:01.592 --> 01:03.194
Hacker.

01:03.227 --> 01:04.396
Yes, sir?

01:04.429 --> 01:06.232
When you're done
here, we need to talk.

01:07.498 --> 01:09.068
Is a...

01:09.101 --> 01:10.635
Is everything okay?

01:10.668 --> 01:12.537
I said we'll talk
when you're done.

01:39.897 --> 01:41.500
I have it right here, Mr. Tana.

01:44.303 --> 01:46.839
I have one of my best men here
to deliver the case to you.

01:46.872 --> 01:49.875
You should have it very
soon, and once you do,

01:49.908 --> 01:51.210
I'll wait for your reading.

01:54.646 --> 01:56.849
This case in invaluable
to me, Duvall.

01:56.881 --> 02:00.318
You are to deliver it to
Mr. Tana without incident.

02:00.352 --> 02:01.187
Am I understood?

02:02.054 --> 02:02.855
Well, yeah.

02:02.887 --> 02:04.355
This?

02:04.388 --> 02:05.757
This is gonna be the
easiest assignment

02:05.790 --> 02:07.393
you've ever given me, boss.

02:07.426 --> 02:08.961
Consider it done.

02:08.993 --> 02:10.461
It better be.

02:10.495 --> 02:11.763
Now take care of it.

02:49.834 --> 02:51.636
You incompetent idiot!

02:53.105 --> 02:54.506
I gave you a simple assignment

02:54.540 --> 02:57.576
and you fuck it in the
first five minutes!

02:57.608 --> 02:58.444
Unbelievable!

03:03.682 --> 03:04.850
Calm?

03:04.882 --> 03:08.421
I have a very important
assignment for you.

05:03.035 --> 05:04.770
I don't know much about art

05:04.802 --> 05:07.305
but one thing I don't
know is any rich artist.

05:08.407 --> 05:11.210
I'm probably not
gonna be rich doing this

05:11.242 --> 05:13.045
but that's not the point.

05:13.078 --> 05:14.647
What is the point?

05:14.679 --> 05:17.283
For all that hassle, I best
be pulling in some bank.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.519
How're you gonna
get away with it?

05:20.552 --> 05:21.587
Get away with what?

05:21.619 --> 05:23.054
Chet.

05:23.088 --> 05:24.823
I don't see how someone
as superficial as him

05:24.855 --> 05:26.357
could even stand to
be seen in public

05:26.391 --> 05:29.295
with a lowly little art
school chick like yourself.

05:30.429 --> 05:33.198
Chet knows when not
to cross the line.

05:33.230 --> 05:34.499
There's a line?

05:34.533 --> 05:35.600
When did that happen?

05:38.670 --> 05:39.872
So what's Chet gonna be?

05:41.973 --> 05:43.141
An attorney.

05:43.175 --> 05:45.910
Which is something
that turns my stomach.

05:47.312 --> 05:50.014
It's just what this world
needs, another lawyer.

05:50.047 --> 05:51.350
Not all lawyers are bad.

05:52.216 --> 05:53.518
Now you're defending him?

05:53.552 --> 05:54.753
I'm not defending him.

05:54.785 --> 05:57.589
I'm defending the
good name of lawyers.

05:58.989 --> 06:01.492
It doesn't matter what
Chet thinks anymore anyway.

06:01.525 --> 06:03.795
It's not like we're gonna
be together forever.

06:05.629 --> 06:06.831
When's the marriage?

06:06.864 --> 06:08.600
A couple months once
we're out of school.

06:09.768 --> 06:11.470
I may be wrong
but that sounds like

06:11.502 --> 06:13.004
the opposite of breaking up.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.208
You don't have the guts
to tell him, do you?

06:18.143 --> 06:20.012
I don't know how to.

06:20.045 --> 06:22.948
And there is someone else.

06:24.316 --> 06:25.217
Who?

06:25.249 --> 06:26.050
Billy?

06:26.083 --> 06:27.251
Ew, no.

06:27.285 --> 06:28.087
Then who?

06:28.987 --> 06:30.189
I don't know his name!

06:40.198 --> 06:41.567
Let me get this straight.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.502
You don't even now his name?

06:44.535 --> 06:46.037
Where did you meet him?

06:46.071 --> 06:46.905
Yeah.

06:48.372 --> 06:49.173
Funny story.

06:49.206 --> 06:51.177
I haven't, actually.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.412
So you're stalking some guy?

06:53.444 --> 06:54.245
Yes.

06:54.278 --> 06:56.081
No, not stalking.

06:56.114 --> 06:59.952
He's just this guy I've
seen around campus.

06:59.985 --> 07:01.619
Oooh, my girl's
creeping on some dude.

07:01.653 --> 07:04.056
I'm not "creeping
on some dude."

07:04.088 --> 07:05.757
Is the butt nice?

07:05.790 --> 07:07.024
Tell me the butt's nice.

07:07.057 --> 07:08.593
I am not having this
conversation with you.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.196
Just fucking with you, chill.

07:11.328 --> 07:12.530
So how long have
you been side-eyeing

07:12.564 --> 07:14.165
with the intent
to stalk this guy?

07:15.667 --> 07:16.569
Nine months.

07:18.136 --> 07:19.004
Nine months?

07:20.437 --> 07:23.608
You've spent nearly a year
infatuated with some guy

07:23.641 --> 07:25.576
and you haven't even
found out his name yet?

07:25.610 --> 07:27.612
I haven't had the opportunity.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.148
Are you waiting to
have something to do

07:29.180 --> 07:30.281
on your wedding night?

07:31.482 --> 07:33.751
Have you at least
made eye contact?

07:33.785 --> 07:35.687
Well, I did look at him once

07:35.720 --> 07:39.525
and he may or may not
have smiled at me.

07:39.557 --> 07:40.525
Ugh.

07:40.559 --> 07:41.994
You better hurry up and
get the wedding planner

07:42.026 --> 07:42.660
on the phone.

07:43.929 --> 07:45.230
What do I do?

07:45.263 --> 07:47.166
Stop gawking and do something.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.235
It's not as hard as you're
making it out to be.

07:50.268 --> 07:51.403
Just talk to him.

07:51.436 --> 07:53.272
He's probably not your
true love or anything

07:53.304 --> 07:55.773
but you'll never know until
you at least get to know him.

07:55.807 --> 07:56.876
What if he says no?

07:58.576 --> 07:59.944
He's a guy.

07:59.977 --> 08:04.850
What do you think the chances
are of that happening?

10:35.000 --> 10:36.501
Do you think you could tell me

10:36.534 --> 10:38.069
why we were almost just killed?

10:38.102 --> 10:40.137
They had a gun, we didn't.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.806
Who was it that gave
you that thing anyway?

10:41.839 --> 10:42.974
Hacker.

10:43.007 --> 10:44.108
Have me get this bitch open.

10:44.141 --> 10:45.810
I think you need
to get rid of it.

10:45.843 --> 10:47.278
Who knows who's
after that thing.

10:47.311 --> 10:48.312
Are you fucked up?

10:48.346 --> 10:49.815
I don't think so.

10:49.848 --> 10:52.351
I don't think this
is such a good idea.

10:52.383 --> 10:54.752
What else are we gonna
do for the rest of the day?

10:54.785 --> 10:57.856
If this guy's after this,
it could be worth a fortune.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.825
Dead women can't spend money.

10:59.857 --> 11:01.093
I can sure as hell try.

11:02.227 --> 11:03.661
How do you know
there's money in there?

11:03.694 --> 11:05.162
For all you know, it could
be severed body parts.

11:05.195 --> 11:06.030
Ew.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.473
Doesn't smell like body parts.

11:14.506 --> 11:16.675
I can't do this,
I'm going home.

11:16.708 --> 11:17.541
To who?

11:17.574 --> 11:18.410
Chet?

11:19.611 --> 11:22.080
I know you're curious,
Amanda, just admit it.

11:22.112 --> 11:23.348
I'll admit that had I known

11:23.381 --> 11:25.150
that I was gonna
threaten my life today

11:25.183 --> 11:27.019
with this little
reunion of ours,

11:27.051 --> 11:28.686
I would've kept walking.

11:28.719 --> 11:29.920
Come on.

11:29.953 --> 11:31.689
I'm willing to bet you
haven't had this much fun

11:31.723 --> 11:32.757
in a long time.

11:32.790 --> 11:36.294
Our idea of fun
have always differed.

11:36.327 --> 11:37.896
I can't do this.

11:37.929 --> 11:40.399
Don't walk away from
everything, Amanda.

11:40.431 --> 11:42.900
Not unless it's something
you need to walk away from.

11:42.934 --> 11:44.035
And why not?

11:46.771 --> 11:49.274
Because I know
who can open this.

11:49.306 --> 11:50.108
Who?

12:10.694 --> 12:11.963
This is the place.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.565
Well, what if he's not home?

12:14.598 --> 12:15.566
He's home.

12:15.599 --> 12:17.401
All the shades are down.

12:17.434 --> 12:20.638
Foster can have this thing
open in a few seconds.

12:20.671 --> 12:21.572
Foster?

12:21.606 --> 12:23.075
Don't I know him or something?

12:23.107 --> 12:23.842
Probably.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.210
He went to high school with us.

12:25.242 --> 12:27.411
A couple years behind us.

12:27.444 --> 12:28.946
Can you trust him?

12:28.979 --> 12:30.081
Yeah.

12:30.115 --> 12:31.617
There is no place safer.

12:34.919 --> 12:35.953
Do we knock?

12:43.627 --> 12:45.329
Are you sure he's home?

12:45.362 --> 12:47.364
He's just checking
to see if it's safe.

12:47.397 --> 12:48.566
Safe from what?

12:55.039 --> 12:55.973
Who is it?

12:56.006 --> 12:57.476
It's me, Lynese.

12:57.508 --> 12:58.976
Are you sure?

12:59.010 --> 13:01.380
I'm too good
looking to be anybody else.

13:02.914 --> 13:04.082
Who is she?

13:04.115 --> 13:05.317
This is Amanda.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.184
She's a friend of mine.

13:07.218 --> 13:08.453
Is she cool?

13:08.486 --> 13:10.355
No, she's not cool.

13:10.387 --> 13:11.489
But you can trust her.

13:13.424 --> 13:14.226
Come in.

13:14.258 --> 13:15.326
Come on.

13:15.359 --> 13:16.594
You give them
something to look at,

13:16.627 --> 13:17.463
they might see something.

13:22.065 --> 13:23.734
You weren't followed, were you?

13:23.767 --> 13:24.735
By who?

13:24.769 --> 13:25.971
It's whom.

13:26.003 --> 13:27.938
You know?

13:27.972 --> 13:28.874
Them.

13:28.906 --> 13:30.474
Now Foster, we're cool.

13:30.507 --> 13:32.677
Yeah, that's what
they want you to think.

13:33.545 --> 13:34.779
Let's just hope you're right.

13:34.811 --> 13:36.180
We just need your
help with something.

13:36.213 --> 13:37.482
What do you need, wiretap?

13:37.515 --> 13:38.717
Video surveillance?

13:38.750 --> 13:39.952
No, nothing like that.

13:41.519 --> 13:43.455
We just need this open.

13:43.487 --> 13:44.522
That's a nice case.

13:45.522 --> 13:46.324
Can you do it?

13:46.357 --> 13:47.791
What's in it?

13:47.824 --> 13:49.494
I don't know, we found it.

13:50.661 --> 13:51.762
Let's see, shall we?

14:00.070 --> 14:02.406
It's a simple lock, it
shouldn't be too hard.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.284
It's not wired, at least.

14:13.284 --> 14:14.953
You say you found this?

14:14.986 --> 14:17.622
We were thinking that maybe
there was something in it

14:17.655 --> 14:19.891
that could tell us
who it belongs to.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.560
How noble of you.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.465
Are you sure this
wasn't planted?

14:27.497 --> 14:28.867
What do you mean?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.968
I mean, left particularly
for you to find it.

14:31.001 --> 14:32.203
I know what "it" means.

14:32.237 --> 14:34.039
I don't
know why you asked.

14:34.973 --> 14:35.806
Can you do it?

14:38.675 --> 14:39.511
Yeah.

14:40.511 --> 14:41.713
Let me get my tools.

14:41.746 --> 14:42.713
Appreciate it.

14:42.747 --> 14:43.748
I'll be right back.

14:47.785 --> 14:49.721
Don't you think this
guy's a little off?

14:51.389 --> 14:54.859
Isn't that kinda like the
pot calling the kettle quiet?

14:54.891 --> 14:57.295
I'm quiet, I'm not weird.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.664
I'd definitely
call you strange.

14:59.697 --> 15:01.433
Don't be insulted by it.

15:01.466 --> 15:02.667
What would you rather
be called anyway?

15:02.699 --> 15:03.569
Strange or normal?

15:04.501 --> 15:05.370
I don't know.

15:06.503 --> 15:08.272
I'd trust Foster
with anything.

15:08.305 --> 15:11.309
Okay, he's not quite
what you think.

15:11.342 --> 15:13.712
Don't you think he's taking
this whole conspiracy thing

15:13.745 --> 15:15.046
a bit too far?

15:15.078 --> 15:17.048
It's been done to death already.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.515
Chill out about it.

15:18.549 --> 15:20.218
All right, he's gonna
get this case open for us

15:20.251 --> 15:21.886
and we can see what all
the trouble was for.

15:21.919 --> 15:23.188
What if there's
money in there?

15:23.221 --> 15:25.624
What're you gonna do with it?

15:26.556 --> 15:28.158
Buy myself a new man.

15:28.192 --> 15:29.060
I'm serious.

15:29.093 --> 15:29.928
So am I.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.597
Maybe you should do the same.

15:32.630 --> 15:35.634
Well, I'm certainly
not going to do that.

15:35.666 --> 15:37.602
I could always ask
out what's-his-name.

15:39.036 --> 15:40.037
What's his name?

15:40.070 --> 15:41.705
Do you hear yourself right now?

15:41.738 --> 15:43.441
Is that what we're
gonna call him?

15:45.676 --> 15:48.045
Stand back, I'll have this
thing open in just a second.

15:48.078 --> 15:48.914
Let's see.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.216
Yeah.

15:55.453 --> 15:56.288
Okay.

16:12.670 --> 16:13.872
Somebody lose something?

16:14.972 --> 16:16.540
A lottery ticket?

16:16.574 --> 16:18.876
We were almost killed
for a lottery ticket?!

16:18.910 --> 16:21.112
Calm down, Amanda.

16:21.145 --> 16:22.213
Is it worth anything?

16:22.246 --> 16:23.648
Yeah, yeah, it's a winner.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.684
It came up last week, I think.

16:25.717 --> 16:26.851
How do you know?

16:26.883 --> 16:28.152
It has four double
digit numbers.

16:28.185 --> 16:29.853
I remember everything.

16:29.886 --> 16:31.455
What's it worth?

16:31.488 --> 16:32.589
500 thousand.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.792
Or, well, three hundred
and 70 thousand,

16:34.825 --> 16:39.463
two hundred and 53 dollars
and 89 cents, after taxes.

16:41.165 --> 16:42.099
Are you sure?

16:42.132 --> 16:43.167
Barring deductions.

16:47.438 --> 16:48.273
Now,

16:49.940 --> 16:51.108
you say you found this?

16:52.242 --> 16:53.411
Practically.

16:54.846 --> 16:56.381
Practically?

16:56.414 --> 16:58.250
- Hacker gave it to me.
- Hacker?!

17:00.584 --> 17:02.820
Who was that man
that was chasing you?

17:02.853 --> 17:05.455
I don't know, some big
dude in a black Hummer.

17:05.490 --> 17:06.857
Oh my gosh.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.358
That man was Calm.

17:08.393 --> 17:10.228
Calm my ass, all right,
he seemed more like hostile.

17:10.261 --> 17:11.396
His name is Calm.

17:11.428 --> 17:13.030
Who is Calm?!

17:13.063 --> 17:14.865
He's a myth, an urban legend.

17:14.897 --> 17:16.767
Well he seemed
pretty real to me.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.970
That means this
case is your boss's.

17:20.238 --> 17:21.439
Your boss?

17:21.472 --> 17:22.973
I thought you were an
independent contractor.

17:23.007 --> 17:24.976
You don't need to
worry about that right now.

17:25.009 --> 17:26.744
What do we need
to worry about?

17:26.778 --> 17:28.444
We lost this Calm guy already.

17:28.479 --> 17:29.948
What else could happen?

17:29.981 --> 17:32.050
Besides, with a name like
Calm, how tough could he be?

17:32.082 --> 17:34.351
If Calm was after me,

17:34.385 --> 17:36.253
I'd grow eyes in
the back of my head.

17:37.187 --> 17:38.622
That's just a word of advice.

17:39.523 --> 17:41.559
Or, well, a few anyways.

17:41.591 --> 17:43.794
Do you have a
bathroom around here?

17:43.828 --> 17:45.297
Yeah, upstairs to the left.

17:46.563 --> 17:47.398
Be right back.

17:58.608 --> 18:01.213
What have I gotten myself into?

18:03.047 --> 18:04.816
Do you know where
Hacker got the case from?

18:05.683 --> 18:07.285
All he said was it
was worth some money

18:07.318 --> 18:09.119
if I held on to it for awhile.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.655
Look, Calm's the one
who came after us.

18:10.687 --> 18:12.290
Calm.

18:12.322 --> 18:13.524
Well,

18:13.558 --> 18:15.326
Hacker does small jobs
for organized crime.

18:15.358 --> 18:16.395
This could be our in.

18:20.630 --> 18:21.465
I'm so sorry.

18:31.107 --> 18:33.011
You mean this is for him?

18:33.043 --> 18:36.146
Yeah, so I'd keep that
fact quiet around Amanda.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.482
So we finally have
something on Vito.

18:37.514 --> 18:38.883
Well, maybe.

18:40.283 --> 18:42.587
If Calm was after it,
then he must be involved.

18:43.753 --> 18:45.322
I'm not sure where
this leads you.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.092
It's a jumping off point.

18:59.470 --> 19:00.972
What have you been up to?

19:01.004 --> 19:02.473
I think we better get going.

19:02.507 --> 19:03.942
Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

19:03.974 --> 19:06.677
If Calm was after you,
he'd track you here to me.

19:06.711 --> 19:08.346
You're talking to me.

19:08.378 --> 19:09.481
You want in on this?

19:09.513 --> 19:11.348
No, I don't want any
part of a lottery system.

19:11.382 --> 19:12.884
Instead of using that
money for schools,

19:12.916 --> 19:14.051
it could really be used

19:14.085 --> 19:15.353
for secret government
alien research.

19:16.587 --> 19:17.989
I don't believe in aliens.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.224
Why not?

19:20.258 --> 19:23.194
Cause there's no such
thing as a black alien.

19:23.226 --> 19:25.629
I don't buy that the most
highly advanced species

19:25.663 --> 19:27.531
in the entire universe
is just a bunch of

19:27.565 --> 19:31.269
short, skinny, bald white dudes.

19:31.301 --> 19:32.971
They're gray, you know.

19:33.003 --> 19:34.705
Whatever, we're out of here.

19:36.007 --> 19:38.510
Say hi to your brother for me.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.749
Here, take this.

19:44.781 --> 19:46.917
In case you get into trouble,
you'll know how to call me.

19:46.951 --> 19:48.086
Sure thing.

19:48.118 --> 19:49.587
Just remember,

19:49.619 --> 19:51.188
be cool.

19:51.222 --> 19:52.656
This world is an
unhappy playground

19:52.690 --> 19:54.659
full of crazy
cartoon characters.

19:56.327 --> 19:57.496
That's deep.

20:00.830 --> 20:02.199
Watch your backs.

20:18.214 --> 20:19.416
Who's Foster's brother?

20:19.450 --> 20:20.885
Harrison.

20:20.917 --> 20:23.053
That's one fine
pare of bluejeans.

20:23.087 --> 20:25.390
That's the kind of guy you
should be hooking up with.

20:25.423 --> 20:26.424
That's him.

20:26.456 --> 20:27.425
Him who?

20:27.457 --> 20:29.026
That's the guy.

20:30.627 --> 20:32.129
Foster' brother, Harrison?

20:33.196 --> 20:34.866
How do you know it's him?

20:34.898 --> 20:38.435
I saw his picture on the wall.

20:38.469 --> 20:39.404
It's a start.

20:39.436 --> 20:40.871
At least you know his name now.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.308
You shoulda kept
hanging out with me.

20:43.340 --> 20:45.443
You might've hooked
up with him sooner.

20:45.475 --> 20:46.276
Did you ever?

20:46.309 --> 20:48.146
No, not with him.

20:48.178 --> 20:49.379
Harrison's one of the good ones.

20:49.413 --> 20:50.749
I never play 'em like that.

20:51.915 --> 20:53.518
But there is one
thing about Harrison

20:53.550 --> 20:55.619
you should definitely know.

20:55.653 --> 20:58.155
In fact, I don't understand
how you don't already.

20:58.188 --> 20:59.256
And what's that?

21:00.558 --> 21:01.659
Damn it.

21:01.692 --> 21:03.126
What is it now?

21:03.159 --> 21:04.828
I left my sketchbook inside.

21:04.861 --> 21:06.630
Then go back and get it.

21:06.664 --> 21:09.000
Unless you're afraid of
running into bluejeans.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.168
I'll be right back.

21:11.202 --> 21:12.436
Make it quick

21:12.470 --> 21:14.539
or I'll take this
money for myself.

21:14.571 --> 21:16.373
I think you'd be
doing me a favor.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.309
Time's up.

22:26.342 --> 22:28.445
I'm sorry, could
you please excuse us?

22:28.479 --> 22:30.115
I'll see you again next week.

22:31.982 --> 22:34.719
Vito, what can I do for you?

22:34.751 --> 22:36.120
My case has been stolen.

22:38.121 --> 22:40.290
And who would steal from you?

22:40.323 --> 22:42.292
An ex-employee of mine.

22:42.326 --> 22:44.395
I need your help
with this matter.

22:44.427 --> 22:45.929
What are you going
to do about it?

22:45.963 --> 22:47.130
I've got Calm on it.

22:47.164 --> 22:49.467
He should have it back shortly.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.903
I know it's been handed
off to a couple of kids.

22:53.236 --> 22:54.038
Hmmm.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.540
Yes.

22:56.573 --> 22:59.843
I see your man watching
the two artful dodgers.

23:01.278 --> 23:03.748
I'm going to need some more
time meditating on this.

23:05.316 --> 23:07.050
Notify me immediately

23:07.084 --> 23:09.420
if the ticket changes locations.

23:09.453 --> 23:11.388
It is imperative
that you let me know

23:11.422 --> 23:13.191
so we can dispose
of it properly.

23:15.091 --> 23:19.196
Or otherwise, grave things
could be coming your way.

23:19.230 --> 23:22.232
I promise, you'll be the first
to know when I get it back.

23:43.721 --> 23:45.556
I have a job for you.

23:45.588 --> 23:47.291
I need you to do
something for me.

23:49.126 --> 23:50.862
Yes, I love you too.

23:51.861 --> 23:52.730
Now listen to me.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.203
I wanna know who they are!

24:00.271 --> 24:01.806
Sorry.

24:01.838 --> 24:04.274
I can't help you with that.

24:04.308 --> 24:05.477
Yes you can.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.279
Why were they here?

24:08.311 --> 24:09.813
They were Jehovah's Witnesses.

24:09.847 --> 24:12.383
They tried to convince me
into being born again but,

24:12.415 --> 24:14.952
well, I told them I was
born right the first time.

24:14.984 --> 24:16.353
Debatable.

24:16.386 --> 24:18.222
You like lying to me, Foster?

24:18.254 --> 24:21.758
Let's see how you like
lying in a shallow grave.

24:21.791 --> 24:24.529
Not lying, it's sarcasm.

24:25.596 --> 24:27.132
Didn't you notice my smug grin?

24:28.264 --> 24:29.399
Besides, you wouldn't
want to burry them

24:29.433 --> 24:30.568
in a shallow grave aways.

24:30.600 --> 24:31.868
It wouldn't take
long before the earth

24:31.902 --> 24:33.437
would turn up their bones
back up to the surface

24:33.470 --> 24:34.872
and then some kid
who's about to get some

24:34.905 --> 24:37.274
from his girlfriend for
the first time finds them.

24:37.308 --> 24:39.676
She freaks out,
he can't get laid.

24:39.710 --> 24:42.113
She's in the mental institute
from the shock, and well,

24:42.146 --> 24:44.982
he's at home setting the
world masturbation record.

24:45.014 --> 24:46.783
Then, of course, the
police find them,

24:46.817 --> 24:49.020
trace the DNA and they
trace it back to you.

24:50.386 --> 24:51.955
Of course, there wouldn't
be any hair samples

24:51.989 --> 24:53.424
at the scene of the crime.

24:55.960 --> 24:58.261
By the way, did you get
that thing wax or polished?

24:58.294 --> 24:59.396
I mean, it looks good, you know?

24:59.430 --> 25:01.766
Kinda like a Bruce Willis,

25:01.799 --> 25:03.768
you know, a real man's man.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.470
You love to hear yourself
talk, don't you, Foster?

25:06.502 --> 25:09.240
I love the way you put
emphasis on each little grunt.

25:10.607 --> 25:12.376
You talk so much because
I make you nervous.

25:12.408 --> 25:13.543
No, I talk so much

25:13.577 --> 25:15.946
because I know how
much it pisses you off.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.549
I love to see the little veins
on your forehead throbbing.

25:18.581 --> 25:19.916
You know, for a guy
with the name Calm,

25:19.950 --> 25:22.653
you sure have a lot of
pent up anger issues.

25:22.685 --> 25:24.955
You ever thought about seeing
a therapist about that?

25:24.989 --> 25:26.524
Maybe while you're at it,

25:26.557 --> 25:29.827
check why you're still
nothing but Vito's lapdog.

25:29.859 --> 25:33.830
You have any idea how
easily I could kill you?

25:33.864 --> 25:36.434
I'd just come back
as a poltergeist

25:36.466 --> 25:37.968
and at the most
inopportune times,

25:38.001 --> 25:39.337
shove things up your ass.

25:42.338 --> 25:43.808
Anything you have on me,

25:44.974 --> 25:46.877
it's not gonna keep
you alive forever.

25:48.044 --> 25:49.613
It will.

25:49.646 --> 25:50.682
For long enough.

25:52.415 --> 25:53.350
We'll see.

25:55.184 --> 25:57.321
Since when did you take
up drawing, Foster?

25:59.990 --> 26:00.825
It's a pastime.

26:01.892 --> 26:03.694
Who's A. Ross?

26:03.726 --> 26:04.695
That's a pen name.

26:06.696 --> 26:07.964
You know, if you're
gonna get those people,

26:07.998 --> 26:09.467
you should probably get going.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.703
"Those aren't the girls
you're looking for."

26:13.103 --> 26:15.740
You always think you're
so clever, don't you?

26:15.772 --> 26:18.309
I have to admit, sometimes
you do surprise me.

26:18.341 --> 26:20.777
I'm just
full of surprises.

26:20.810 --> 26:21.745
Oh, don't hurt
yourself thinking

26:21.779 --> 26:24.147
with that big brain of yours.

26:24.181 --> 26:25.683
I know one of their names now.

26:27.050 --> 26:27.985
You keep the book.

26:41.197 --> 26:43.066
Do you think
Foster will be okay?

26:43.099 --> 26:45.468
We basically led that
guy right to him.

26:45.501 --> 26:48.873
Believe me, Foster can
take care of himself.

26:48.905 --> 26:50.774
Someday I'll tell
you some stories.

26:50.808 --> 26:54.845
I just remember him being
this weird guy from high school.

26:54.877 --> 26:55.914
You never knew him.

26:57.647 --> 26:58.782
And how did you?

26:59.649 --> 27:01.451
I may have been your
only friend in high school

27:01.484 --> 27:02.986
but I knew everybody.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.622
I had other friends.

27:06.557 --> 27:08.592
You were my best friend though.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.828
Man, we had some crazy times.

27:10.860 --> 27:13.664
Some of the crazy shit
you would put me through.

27:13.696 --> 27:15.232
What happened?

27:15.264 --> 27:16.434
You know what happened.

27:16.466 --> 27:18.134
You just don't want to admit it.

27:18.167 --> 27:21.438
Did you ever think that
maybe it was my decision?

27:21.472 --> 27:23.941
Maybe I didn't want to
see where you'd end up.

27:23.973 --> 27:24.943
I'm right here.

27:26.109 --> 27:27.578
I always hate it when
you would never say

27:27.610 --> 27:28.912
what you actually meant.

27:28.945 --> 27:29.780
Just say it!

27:31.214 --> 27:33.350
Okay, maybe I didn't wanna
be friends with a drug dealer

27:33.384 --> 27:34.585
for the rest of my life, okay?

27:34.617 --> 27:36.386
Things weren't like
this before your mom.

27:36.419 --> 27:37.287
Don't!

27:37.320 --> 27:38.856
You know, you used
to be the one person

27:38.888 --> 27:40.992
I could trust to
tell the truth to.

27:41.024 --> 27:43.093
Now I doubt you'd even listen.

27:45.029 --> 27:46.230
I'm going home.

27:46.262 --> 27:47.865
I'll mail you half
of the ticket.

28:19.896 --> 28:21.499
Agent Julie Franklin?

28:23.399 --> 28:24.934
You must be Foster.

28:24.967 --> 28:27.704
I am, at least,
that's with my mother.

28:27.738 --> 28:30.008
I'd prefer something
more sophisticated.

28:30.973 --> 28:33.109
You can't pick your parents.

28:33.143 --> 28:34.944
Well it's nice to
meet you, Foster.

28:34.978 --> 28:36.714
Thank you for contacting me.

28:36.746 --> 28:38.481
But I am curious,
how did you get my...

28:38.514 --> 28:40.884
You helped investigate
the murder of Dian Watson.

28:40.917 --> 28:41.718
Correct?

28:41.751 --> 28:43.087
I did.

28:43.119 --> 28:45.289
Local law enforcement
asked for our help.

28:45.321 --> 28:46.790
How did you know that?

28:46.823 --> 28:49.526
We kept the FBI's involvement
in that case pretty low key.

28:50.527 --> 28:51.629
I can find anything.

28:52.863 --> 28:54.865
But she was my friend's mother,

28:54.897 --> 28:56.634
so I considered it personal.

28:56.666 --> 28:58.069
I see.

28:58.101 --> 29:00.303
Is this a vendetta then?

29:00.337 --> 29:03.206
I don't believe in
vengeance, Agent Franklin.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.543
I believe in doing what's right.

29:05.576 --> 29:08.011
Sometimes that means stepping
out of your comfort zone.

29:09.046 --> 29:10.148
Which is why I'm here.

29:17.221 --> 29:18.923
Worried about someone, Foster?

29:18.955 --> 29:20.023
We can protect you.

29:21.425 --> 29:23.327
Always worried.

29:23.359 --> 29:24.661
Only the paranoid survive.

29:25.796 --> 29:27.565
Not sure if I can trust
you completely yet.

29:27.598 --> 29:29.000
So I'll take care of myself.

29:31.033 --> 29:32.235
I did hear good things about you

29:32.269 --> 29:34.439
after your investigation
with Dian's murderer.

29:36.039 --> 29:39.977
So I felt like you were the
person to bring this to.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.947
You weren't very specific
with the information

29:43.981 --> 29:45.648
when you contacted me.

29:45.682 --> 29:48.152
But the names you
dropped intrigued me.

29:49.353 --> 29:52.156
That's because this
won't see a computer.

29:52.188 --> 29:53.790
Too easy to get hacked.

29:53.823 --> 29:55.425
Kids these days just
don't understand

29:55.459 --> 29:57.261
that old tricks
work in a new world.

29:59.428 --> 30:00.897
You're my personal research.

30:04.734 --> 30:08.039
You do your review on
this and you'll find them.

30:09.373 --> 30:11.842
You don't hurt for
confidence, do you?

30:11.875 --> 30:13.411
Not confident, just thorough.

30:14.877 --> 30:18.115
I want him to go down almost
as badly as my friend does.

30:18.147 --> 30:20.317
If Dian was your
friend's mother,

30:20.349 --> 30:22.653
you must referring to Lynese.

30:22.685 --> 30:23.753
That's right.

30:25.121 --> 30:26.890
Didn't she become
a drug dealer?

30:29.626 --> 30:31.395
That's just her front.

30:31.427 --> 30:32.562
She's been going after him

30:32.596 --> 30:34.431
ever since her
mother was murdered.

30:34.463 --> 30:35.665
No better hiding place

30:35.698 --> 30:37.167
than in plain sight
of your target, right?

30:37.201 --> 30:39.770
Besides, she's used
her money she's made

30:39.802 --> 30:41.438
to put herself
through law school.

30:42.705 --> 30:43.506
Impressive.

30:43.540 --> 30:45.309
Also very dangerous.

30:45.341 --> 30:47.511
You both should
let us handle this.

30:47.543 --> 30:50.413
No offense but we have
and where's that left us?

30:54.483 --> 30:56.252
Sometimes you have to take
matters into your own hands

30:56.286 --> 30:57.221
to get things done.

30:58.855 --> 31:01.858
No offense taken
but I do my time.

31:01.892 --> 31:03.727
Well that's why I'm here.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.098
I have access to most of
the people in Vito's circle.

31:08.030 --> 31:09.500
Most of them can't stand him.

31:10.733 --> 31:13.203
I think you can use
them to turn on Vito.

31:13.236 --> 31:14.871
Maybe offer immunity.

31:14.905 --> 31:18.008
I'm not offering any
immunity to murders, Foster.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.876
That's where it goes too far.

31:19.909 --> 31:21.111
I understand that.

31:21.912 --> 31:23.614
You have a trio of hit
men that either work

31:23.646 --> 31:25.081
or have worked for Vito.

31:25.115 --> 31:26.849
Let them take each other out.

31:26.883 --> 31:28.452
Then whoever's left standing,

31:28.484 --> 31:29.419
you take them down.

31:30.854 --> 31:34.125
Save these tax payers a lot
of money in the long run.

31:35.291 --> 31:36.926
I take it this is
what you meant by

31:36.960 --> 31:39.530
"step outside your
comfort zone."

31:39.562 --> 31:41.631
I'm glad you're paying
attention, Agent Franklin.

31:42.698 --> 31:43.700
Be in touch.

31:45.135 --> 31:47.504
Time to get things in motion.

32:00.684 --> 32:02.118
Go a little more to the left.

32:03.185 --> 32:08.091
Oh, yeah, that's it.

32:11.161 --> 32:12.596
Duvall.

32:12.628 --> 32:15.632
Well, well, what do I have
the pleasure of your company?

32:15.665 --> 32:18.235
Oh my God, cut the
fake accent already.

32:19.136 --> 32:20.238
I know you're a fraud.

32:21.838 --> 32:23.674
Aren't you so smart.

32:23.706 --> 32:25.642
So what the fuck do you want?

32:25.675 --> 32:28.279
You know, Vito might
buy into all this crap,

32:28.311 --> 32:31.048
but I'm sorry, I just don't.

32:32.115 --> 32:33.349
Listen,

32:33.383 --> 32:34.785
that man will cut
you in an instant.

32:34.818 --> 32:36.787
So, Regina, ask yourself,

32:36.819 --> 32:39.522
is it time to kill
or to be killed?

32:39.556 --> 32:41.459
Sounds like a
business proposal.

32:42.392 --> 32:43.594
Oh my God,

32:43.626 --> 32:45.695
you know, that's
exactly what it is

32:45.729 --> 32:47.431
for you and your boyfriend.

32:48.799 --> 32:50.332
Bradly.

32:50.334 --> 32:51.168
Come join us.

32:56.505 --> 32:57.940
Duvall.

32:57.973 --> 32:58.775
Little brother.

33:00.077 --> 33:01.279
What, you couldn't
afford a room?

33:02.479 --> 33:03.646
I have a client
coming in soon.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.983
Just taking advantage
of the time.

33:06.015 --> 33:07.483
Hey, I'm not a hater.

33:07.517 --> 33:09.586
You get you pickle tickled
whenever you can, okay?

33:09.618 --> 33:10.788
Okay, listen,

33:10.820 --> 33:12.488
I'm sure you two are
aware of a certain case

33:12.521 --> 33:13.723
has been stolen.

33:13.757 --> 33:15.092
Yeah, wasn't the
case stolen form you

33:15.125 --> 33:17.261
and aren't you Vito's best man?

33:17.293 --> 33:18.661
You're right,
you're right, I am.

33:18.694 --> 33:20.063
That's funny, that's funny.

33:22.232 --> 33:24.535
You two have no
room to talk here.

33:25.801 --> 33:27.971
But hey, I'm here
to talk business.

33:28.003 --> 33:30.340
Let's put all that aside, okay?

33:30.374 --> 33:31.842
I know what was in that case.

33:32.842 --> 33:34.577
Color me interested.

33:34.610 --> 33:36.479
Oh, Regina, I'll
color you anything.

33:37.414 --> 33:38.882
Hey.

33:38.915 --> 33:41.184
I wouldn't push from where
you get your honey from.

33:41.217 --> 33:42.652
She makes a good point.

33:42.685 --> 33:44.021
- She makes a good point.
- I know.

33:44.053 --> 33:45.955
So what do you need from us?

33:46.956 --> 33:48.825
I'm gonna get that case back.

33:48.858 --> 33:51.561
I have intel that it was
taken to a couple young ladies

33:51.595 --> 33:53.797
who needed a little bit
of help getting it open.

33:53.829 --> 33:56.899
The help they went to
is a contact of mine.

33:56.933 --> 33:59.869
So I need from you two
is to use no stress

33:59.903 --> 34:03.440
that he has on the both of
you to put him six feet under.

34:03.473 --> 34:05.009
Yeah, I'll do it, yeah.

34:06.143 --> 34:07.144
God, he's adorable.

34:07.176 --> 34:07.944
Isn't he cute?

34:07.978 --> 34:09.279
Isn't he cute?!

34:09.312 --> 34:10.647
That's what I tell
everybody, he's the cute one.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.750
Listen, I love the enthusiasm.

34:12.783 --> 34:14.985
Being a hired killer is just
a little bit more involved

34:15.016 --> 34:16.819
than just pulling a trigger.

34:16.851 --> 34:19.054
Look, I just wanna
be like my big brother.

34:20.422 --> 34:22.658
Our mom and dad
would be so proud.

34:22.690 --> 34:25.396
As much as I love this
little family reunion and all,

34:25.428 --> 34:28.498
how do I know I can trust you
not to run off with the case?

34:28.531 --> 34:29.766
If,

34:29.800 --> 34:31.833
if we do our jobs right,

34:31.868 --> 34:33.636
there's a whole lot more
to be had then just what's

34:33.668 --> 34:35.539
in one stupid, little case.

34:35.571 --> 34:36.806
Think about it.

34:36.839 --> 34:38.775
I'm surprised you hadn't
thought of this already.

34:38.809 --> 34:40.676
You think he kept his
entire fortune in there?

34:40.708 --> 34:42.678
No, he didn't.

34:42.710 --> 34:45.081
It's scattered about and
we can get to it but,

34:45.947 --> 34:47.583
now this is key,

34:47.617 --> 34:49.819
we have to play the
loan game on this one.

34:49.851 --> 34:51.388
This is not a quickie.

34:52.522 --> 34:54.458
Y'all picking up what
I'm putting down?

34:54.489 --> 34:56.458
God, I've never
been that patient.

34:56.493 --> 35:00.097
Well, I guess that's why
you've never had a big payday.

35:00.129 --> 35:01.597
So, listen,

35:01.631 --> 35:06.002
I will get back to letting
you two discuss things,

35:07.136 --> 35:08.839
how you're gonna take
Vito out and all,

35:08.872 --> 35:10.941
I will focus on the aftermath.

35:12.175 --> 35:13.010
Deal?

35:15.345 --> 35:18.482
Sounds like the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

35:18.515 --> 35:19.383
Shut up.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.396
Howdy.

35:32.428 --> 35:33.863
We're not buying
anything you're selling.

35:33.897 --> 35:35.466
You're right, she is sassy.

35:35.499 --> 35:36.600
Lynese, it's okay.

35:36.633 --> 35:37.801
He's with me.

35:39.169 --> 35:40.004
Foster?

35:40.937 --> 35:42.806
What the hell is going on?

35:42.839 --> 35:45.376
Meet us in the alley over
there and I'll explain.

35:59.689 --> 36:02.225
What the hell else could
you possibly be involved with?

36:02.258 --> 36:04.961
Wait, wait, you found
out the George Bush Senior

36:04.995 --> 36:07.097
was actually the second
gunman on the grassy knoll

36:07.129 --> 36:08.798
and you just had
to tell someone.

36:08.832 --> 36:10.834
Well, he was in
Texas at the time

36:10.867 --> 36:12.002
and he did work for the CIA.

36:12.035 --> 36:13.103
Oh my fucking God.

36:14.771 --> 36:16.173
Conspiracy theorists everywhere.

36:16.205 --> 36:17.540
Oswald acted alone.

36:17.573 --> 36:18.408
Moving on.

36:19.809 --> 36:21.477
I don't think we can
work together after this.

36:21.510 --> 36:22.845
Hello!

36:22.879 --> 36:24.515
Can we please get
back to the situation

36:24.548 --> 36:28.185
that has us standing here
with this man we don't know.

36:28.218 --> 36:29.419
My apologies.

36:29.452 --> 36:31.088
Ladies, this is Duvall.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.055
Duvall, Lynese and Amanda.

36:33.089 --> 36:34.992
He used to work as
a hit man for Vito.

36:36.359 --> 36:38.962
Great, perfect, exactly
who we should trust.

36:38.995 --> 36:40.063
My thoughts exactly.

36:40.095 --> 36:41.664
He'll need the ticket.

36:41.698 --> 36:43.232
Uh, no.

36:43.265 --> 36:45.568
We've been through
hell with this ticket.

36:45.602 --> 36:47.404
We're not giving it to you.

36:47.437 --> 36:50.073
We can all appreciate
what you've gone through.

36:50.106 --> 36:52.408
Let's be honest here,
you don't sell drugs

36:52.441 --> 36:56.312
because of the
lifestyle, do you?

36:56.345 --> 36:58.881
What's he talking about?

36:58.914 --> 37:01.184
I didn't want you
to find out this way.

37:03.218 --> 37:04.655
Vito's behind my mom's murder.

37:07.457 --> 37:08.659
She's been peddling drugs

37:08.691 --> 37:10.560
so we can get closer
to his enterprise.

37:10.593 --> 37:12.262
Wasn't getting
any closer than me.

37:14.097 --> 37:16.198
Wait, so all of this
has been happening

37:16.231 --> 37:17.934
in our little town of Syndicate?

37:20.937 --> 37:22.106
Consider my mind blown.

37:23.372 --> 37:25.008
And here I thought you
were just being lazy

37:25.040 --> 37:27.044
but you've really been
trying to take down the man

37:27.077 --> 37:28.145
that killed your mom?

37:29.044 --> 37:30.513
Why didn't you tell me, Lynese?

37:30.546 --> 37:33.516
You would've thought I was
crazy and try to stop me.

37:33.550 --> 37:36.086
Well, damn right,
it's too dangerous!

37:36.118 --> 37:38.088
And look where we're at.

37:38.120 --> 37:41.624
We have one of his former hit
men standing here with us.

37:41.658 --> 37:43.060
He needs to be brought down.

37:44.727 --> 37:46.162
What'd you two have in mind?

37:46.196 --> 37:48.065
Well, I've been gathering
some important research

37:48.097 --> 37:50.499
and I passed it on to an FBI
agent you might remember.

37:50.533 --> 37:52.502
Agent Franklin?

37:52.535 --> 37:53.370
That's the one.

37:54.771 --> 37:56.772
You said FBI.

37:56.805 --> 37:58.608
Sorry, habit.

37:58.642 --> 38:01.211
The point is, she's
working with us.

38:01.243 --> 38:02.613
She's gonna get him
from the outside.

38:02.646 --> 38:04.680
We've got Duvall
working from the inside.

38:04.714 --> 38:06.216
And between what
I've got going on

38:06.249 --> 38:07.317
and what Foster's got going on,

38:07.350 --> 38:08.719
we could actually get this guy

38:08.752 --> 38:11.054
and we can get
him with our guns.

38:11.086 --> 38:13.589
So, what do you
get out of this?

38:13.622 --> 38:15.157
Finally, a good question.

38:15.191 --> 38:16.126
I get immunity,

38:16.158 --> 38:17.861
I get a much needed fresh start.

38:18.761 --> 38:20.196
Listen, I want out of this life.

38:20.229 --> 38:24.700
I cannot do that with
that fucking ticket.

38:24.734 --> 38:27.371
Why don't we hang on to it?

38:27.403 --> 38:28.571
Besides, what do
you need it for?

38:28.604 --> 38:30.807
I don't think
it's just a ticket.

38:30.839 --> 38:32.776
Vito's way too superstitious.

38:32.809 --> 38:35.245
I think the numbers
actually mean something.

38:35.278 --> 38:37.446
Besides, when I give
him back the ticket,

38:37.479 --> 38:38.648
that's when he lowers his guard.

38:38.682 --> 38:40.050
That's when we
can take him down.

38:40.082 --> 38:41.818
I don't know you,
so I don't trust you.

38:41.850 --> 38:44.021
Lynese, I understand.

38:44.053 --> 38:47.657
But he's not just gonna give
away his chance for immunity.

38:47.691 --> 38:48.591
And if he doesn't follow through

38:48.624 --> 38:50.159
with what we want him to do,

38:50.193 --> 38:54.296
he is never getting out of this.

38:54.330 --> 38:55.165
Ooooh.

38:56.365 --> 38:58.367
Please, everyone
just take a breath.

38:58.401 --> 39:00.636
We all want the same thing.

39:00.669 --> 39:02.305
So as far as I'm concerned,

39:02.338 --> 39:04.307
the enemy of my
enemy is my friend.

39:04.339 --> 39:05.175
Good enough?

39:08.944 --> 39:10.680
I'll give it to you.

39:10.714 --> 39:12.982
What you decide to do
with it, I'll trust you.

39:14.883 --> 39:18.021
Other than that,
let's get the fucker.

39:18.053 --> 39:20.089
Now we're talking.

39:26.562 --> 39:27.363
Shit.

39:27.397 --> 39:29.099
What is it now?

39:29.131 --> 39:30.733
Don't let him know
about the ticket.

39:30.767 --> 39:33.270
We're not giving that
back, we earned that shit.

39:33.303 --> 39:34.905
Tell me about it.

39:37.140 --> 39:37.975
Lynese.

39:39.876 --> 39:41.977
I need to talk to you right now.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.079
Let's talk.

40:03.399 --> 40:04.901
What's going on then?

40:04.934 --> 40:06.702
I need the case.

40:06.736 --> 40:07.571
Case?

40:08.972 --> 40:10.140
Where is it?

40:11.274 --> 40:13.109
Oh, that case.

40:14.443 --> 40:15.811
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

40:15.845 --> 40:16.946
What?!

40:16.979 --> 40:18.615
What kind of shit are you
trying to get me into here?

40:18.647 --> 40:19.450
I'm not!

40:23.252 --> 40:25.254
Where is the case, please?

40:25.287 --> 40:26.122
It's gone.

40:28.524 --> 40:29.492
What do you mean, gone?

40:29.526 --> 40:30.993
I mean, gone.

40:31.026 --> 40:33.229
That big son of a bitch
in the black car took it!

40:36.131 --> 40:37.733
Fuck!

40:37.767 --> 40:39.535
Fuck!

40:39.568 --> 40:40.803
Fuck!

40:40.836 --> 40:43.439
What the hell
is going on, Hack?

40:56.051 --> 40:56.852
Who?

40:56.885 --> 40:58.488
Who is gonna kill you?

41:21.510 --> 41:22.845
All right!

41:22.879 --> 41:25.549
I can walk by myself
without you grabbing me!

41:25.582 --> 41:26.817
Your beard is stupid,

41:26.850 --> 41:28.885
your gun is stupid,
your face is stupid.

41:35.758 --> 41:36.993
Just get in.

41:37.026 --> 41:38.761
Asshole!

41:58.881 --> 42:01.483
Come on, pick up
you raging lunatic!

42:01.517 --> 42:02.319
Oh.

42:03.218 --> 42:04.053
Hello?

42:04.086 --> 42:05.287
Yeah, it's me.

42:05.321 --> 42:06.756
Say whatever it is
you need to say.

42:06.789 --> 42:09.559
I scrambled this line for
any wannabe listeners.

42:09.591 --> 42:11.294
Yeah, anyway,

42:11.327 --> 42:12.863
I need some information.

42:14.263 --> 42:16.499
You came to the right
person, I have information.

42:16.531 --> 42:18.501
Did you know that the
moon landing was faked?

42:18.533 --> 42:20.838
I have striking evidence
to support my theory.

42:21.771 --> 42:23.305
Yeah, I'm sure you do

42:23.339 --> 42:26.176
but right now I need to
know where Lynese is.

42:26.209 --> 42:27.477
Where Lynese is?

42:28.845 --> 42:30.580
I thought she was with you.

42:30.613 --> 42:34.417
Listen, Foster, she was
talking to some guy named Hacker

42:34.450 --> 42:36.787
and then some car pulled
up and took them both.

42:39.055 --> 42:41.758
Looks like all this is
finally coming to a head.

42:41.790 --> 42:43.760
I know where they've taken them.

42:43.792 --> 42:45.261
You'll find them at Dominick's.

42:45.294 --> 42:46.829
I'd hurry if I were you.

42:46.863 --> 42:48.397
Dominick's?

42:48.430 --> 42:49.999
That's great.

42:50.033 --> 42:51.635
What is Dominick's?

42:54.037 --> 42:55.071
Great.

42:55.104 --> 42:56.039
Thanks for the help.

42:56.071 --> 42:57.207
I owe you one.

43:08.785 --> 43:10.420
What have you got to tell me?

43:28.805 --> 43:29.606
Members only.

43:30.539 --> 43:32.408
This is my membership card.

43:34.711 --> 43:36.178
I don't see any backup.

43:36.211 --> 43:37.713
It's called technology.

43:37.747 --> 43:38.682
We're always tracked.

43:38.714 --> 43:40.283
So if something happens to me,

43:40.316 --> 43:42.218
you pay the consequences.

43:42.251 --> 43:43.486
Let here through.

43:43.519 --> 43:45.289
Let's see what a waste
of time this will be.

43:47.789 --> 43:49.391
Hello, Agent Franklin.

43:49.425 --> 43:50.292
Would you like a drink?

43:50.325 --> 43:51.827
I don't drink.

43:51.861 --> 43:53.029
Of course you don't.

43:53.062 --> 43:54.397
Straight-laced and clean cut,

43:54.430 --> 43:56.265
just like an FBI
agent should be.

43:57.432 --> 43:59.335
No, I just don't
drink with you.

44:00.635 --> 44:02.137
That hurts.

44:02.171 --> 44:05.408
You can see, I'm very
alert about your feelings.

44:05.441 --> 44:06.843
Let's get to it.

44:06.876 --> 44:08.877
What information are you
going to pretend to have on me

44:08.910 --> 44:10.113
that you really don't,

44:10.146 --> 44:11.747
therefor this is not
going to go anywhere.

44:11.781 --> 44:13.783
You're just wasting your time.

44:13.816 --> 44:15.452
Who said I had any info?

44:15.484 --> 44:17.720
Your greatest fears
are coming true.

44:19.589 --> 44:23.360
You don't know me well enough
to know my greatest fears.

44:23.392 --> 44:25.761
Oh, I know you
better than you think.

44:25.794 --> 44:28.030
Your crew despises you.

44:28.064 --> 44:29.299
Everyone of them
is turning on you

44:29.332 --> 44:32.402
and you're too caught up
in your ego to see it.

44:34.069 --> 44:35.872
What crew do you
speak of, Agent?

44:35.905 --> 44:37.339
You seem to make me out to be

44:37.372 --> 44:38.841
so much more
important than I am.

44:38.874 --> 44:41.110
I'm just a small business owner

44:41.144 --> 44:43.379
trying to make an honest living.

44:43.412 --> 44:45.080
Honest living, right.

44:45.113 --> 44:48.450
Those businesses are just covers
for your money laundering,

44:48.484 --> 44:51.855
drug running and anything
else that will make you buck

44:51.888 --> 44:53.957
no matter who it hurts.

44:53.990 --> 44:55.492
I'm very offended
you have such

44:55.524 --> 44:56.925
a low opinion of me, Agent.

44:56.959 --> 44:59.662
What could I have possibly
done to offend you?

44:59.694 --> 45:02.298
You know, I started
off as a local cop

45:02.330 --> 45:04.267
before I joined the FBI.

45:05.468 --> 45:07.837
So when I see a fellow
officer get murdered,

45:07.870 --> 45:09.105
you could say it hits home.

45:09.138 --> 45:12.142
But you, I came across
you after helping

45:12.175 --> 45:14.778
with an investigation
into Dian Watson's murder.

45:16.546 --> 45:19.415
It was absolutely despicable.

45:19.448 --> 45:21.950
Whoever murdered her was brutal.

45:21.984 --> 45:23.453
Made her suffer.

45:23.486 --> 45:24.788
Almost punishing her

45:24.821 --> 45:27.257
because she was a cop
just doing her job.

45:27.289 --> 45:31.894
No empathy for her as a human
being, a mother, nothing.

45:31.928 --> 45:34.464
Carved her up like a butcher
with a piece of meat.

45:35.798 --> 45:39.269
Whoever did this, whoever
ordered an attack,

45:39.301 --> 45:42.071
they're not human,
they're a monster.

45:42.104 --> 45:45.240
Hunting monsters is exactly
why I joined the FBI.

45:45.274 --> 45:48.344
So I'm back in the sleepy
town of Syndicate, Ohio

45:48.377 --> 45:49.846
to hunt that same monster.

45:56.586 --> 45:58.588
I'll be seeing you soon.

46:08.631 --> 46:10.633
You want me to
take her out, boss?

46:10.665 --> 46:12.434
No, she's harmless.

46:12.468 --> 46:14.636
She has nothing or she
wouldn't have approached me

46:14.669 --> 46:15.938
with that half-assed story.

46:15.972 --> 46:17.140
I don't now, boss.

46:17.173 --> 46:18.809
She sounded pretty
dead on to me.

46:20.109 --> 46:21.411
Don't remind me.

46:21.443 --> 46:23.712
That one definitely
got out of hand.

46:23.745 --> 46:25.180
It was supposed to
look like an accident,

46:25.214 --> 46:27.050
not a goddamned dismemberment.

46:28.350 --> 46:29.919
Nothing we can do about it now.

46:31.187 --> 46:32.022
Let's go.

46:46.334 --> 46:48.737
Hello, Foster, have a seat.

46:48.771 --> 46:51.707
I've got a little
present for you.

46:55.611 --> 46:58.348
Duvall, Dominick,

46:58.381 --> 46:59.848
Foster,

46:59.881 --> 47:02.618
I have brought each of you
here for a specific reason.

47:02.651 --> 47:05.354
As you know, Vito's
days are numbered

47:06.555 --> 47:09.791
and I'm here for
a new beginning.

47:09.825 --> 47:12.729
You'll be getting him
to sell more power to you.

47:12.761 --> 47:15.798
I'm not interested in that.

47:15.830 --> 47:16.832
Foster!

47:16.865 --> 47:17.666
Foster!

47:17.700 --> 47:19.169
I'm not done yet!

47:19.202 --> 47:22.472
I've never disrespected
you and I expect the same!

47:22.504 --> 47:23.972
Sit down!

47:30.879 --> 47:32.247
Thank you.

47:32.281 --> 47:34.050
I want to expand my business

47:34.082 --> 47:37.319
and Syndicate is
prime real estate.

47:37.352 --> 47:39.388
You want us to come
and work for you?

47:39.421 --> 47:42.090
You got a problem
with that, Dominick?

47:42.124 --> 47:43.560
Depends on what you're paying.

47:43.593 --> 47:45.094
I pay very well.

47:45.127 --> 47:46.029
Mr. Judge,

47:46.062 --> 47:48.865
allow me to say that I'm humbled

47:48.897 --> 47:51.867
that you'd ask me to be a
part of your expansion plan.

47:51.901 --> 47:54.703
However, unlike these two,
I'm not from Syndicate,

47:54.736 --> 47:56.972
so where do I fit in?

47:58.173 --> 48:01.543
We know each of you
has a specific talent

48:01.577 --> 48:05.482
which I feel could help
me in my organization.

48:06.781 --> 48:10.319
You know, I'm not
interested in selling drugs,

48:11.754 --> 48:13.423
owning cheap bars,

48:13.455 --> 48:15.258
living separate lives.

48:16.459 --> 48:19.928
Those main things
that government

48:19.961 --> 48:22.431
has good control over,

48:22.464 --> 48:25.234
the religious beliefs,

48:25.267 --> 48:29.972
and the prisons
that has imprisoned

48:30.006 --> 48:31.507
good people.

48:31.539 --> 48:33.943
This all makes me sick.

48:36.278 --> 48:39.481
I want to legalize marijuana,

48:39.515 --> 48:41.685
prostitution and gambling.

48:43.252 --> 48:45.255
I've seen the big picture.

48:45.287 --> 48:46.555
And as for you.

48:48.990 --> 48:51.360
So I'm guessing you're planning
on paying off politicians

48:51.394 --> 48:52.962
to complete these plans.

48:52.995 --> 48:56.132
You know, Foster,
that's exactly right.

48:56.164 --> 48:57.466
It's still corruption.

48:57.499 --> 48:59.301
That's just your version of it.

48:59.334 --> 49:00.269
Sometimes

49:01.470 --> 49:03.740
we have to break the
rules to reset them.

49:04.774 --> 49:07.010
People think the world is bad.

49:07.042 --> 49:07.876
It's not.

49:09.444 --> 49:12.214
But first we have
to deal with Vito.

49:12.247 --> 49:14.850
And I need your help in this.

49:14.883 --> 49:17.686
So I'm gonna let
you think this over.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.562
Okay.

49:28.531 --> 49:31.100
Anyone else notice that he
didn't have a single drink today?

49:31.133 --> 49:32.734
Yeah, I did.

49:32.767 --> 49:34.436
That's a confident
man right there.

49:34.470 --> 49:35.605
Duvall,

49:35.638 --> 49:37.140
we've never had the best
history of working together

49:37.173 --> 49:38.941
but I can let go of the past

49:38.973 --> 49:41.943
and look to a brighter
future if you can.

49:41.977 --> 49:43.078
Vito has to go.

49:44.347 --> 49:45.814
You know what,
I don't blame you.

49:45.847 --> 49:47.449
I've never like that
motherfucker anyway.

49:49.318 --> 49:51.453
Seriously, we need
to make this quicker.

49:51.486 --> 49:53.588
We don't offer him
a lot of details.

49:53.622 --> 49:55.258
That's your job, all right?

49:55.290 --> 49:58.227
We just take our
cut as they come.

49:59.160 --> 50:01.563
Speaking of which, come on.

50:01.597 --> 50:02.799
It's too good to pass up.

50:02.832 --> 50:05.134
Nothing to think
about if you ask me.

50:05.167 --> 50:07.937
Next question is,
how do we do it?

50:07.970 --> 50:09.805
Oh, I have thoughts.

51:08.430 --> 51:10.966
Nice to see you
again, Gilbert.

51:10.999 --> 51:12.434
What's kept you away so long?

51:13.769 --> 51:15.303
What is going on here?

51:18.673 --> 51:19.574
Jesus.

51:19.607 --> 51:20.709
Don't talk out of turn.

51:22.243 --> 51:24.113
That was for just being you.

51:24.146 --> 51:25.680
Who is she and what
is she doing here?

51:25.714 --> 51:28.351
She was with Hacker
when we picked him up.

51:29.885 --> 51:31.988
You seem like an
intelligent young woman.

51:32.021 --> 51:34.524
How did this piece of
shit drag you into this?

51:34.557 --> 51:35.725
You're mostly right.

51:35.758 --> 51:36.926
He is a piece of shit

51:36.959 --> 51:40.997
but I haven't been
dragged into anything.

51:42.531 --> 51:45.101
You sure know how to step
on your dick, don't you?

51:46.234 --> 51:49.070
Am I gonna get
the same treatment?

51:49.104 --> 51:51.006
Would it do any good?

51:51.039 --> 51:52.742
Didn't do Hacker any good.

51:52.774 --> 51:54.543
That's because
Hacker is an idiot.

51:55.778 --> 51:57.814
I got the money.

51:57.847 --> 51:58.781
But it was stolen.

51:58.814 --> 52:00.550
I swear it.

52:00.582 --> 52:02.551
That's right, it was stolen.

52:06.254 --> 52:07.055
Vito?

52:07.089 --> 52:07.924
Do I know you?

52:09.024 --> 52:10.893
Why would you know me?

52:10.926 --> 52:13.529
Is this a friend of yours?

52:13.562 --> 52:14.397
What?

52:15.497 --> 52:16.731
I thought that...

52:16.765 --> 52:18.267
You thought what?

52:18.300 --> 52:20.470
First you lose money
gambling in my club

52:20.502 --> 52:23.439
then you steal from me
to try to pay me back?

52:26.374 --> 52:27.676
This place...

52:27.709 --> 52:28.711
This place?

52:28.743 --> 52:31.713
This place is owned by me.

52:31.747 --> 52:35.218
Didn't you ever wonder who you
were doing computer work for?

52:35.251 --> 52:36.819
You're a dumbass, Hacker.

52:36.852 --> 52:39.254
Where's the briefcase?!

52:39.287 --> 52:41.490
I don't know, okay?

52:42.790 --> 52:44.227
I gave it to her.

52:44.260 --> 52:46.229
So you have the briefcase?

52:47.562 --> 52:50.700
Do I look like I have whatever
case he's talking about?

52:50.732 --> 52:51.700
He's a crack head.

52:52.901 --> 52:54.069
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

52:54.102 --> 52:56.571
He runs up to me
tweeking for some dope

52:56.604 --> 52:58.974
and the next thing I
know, we're being jumped

52:59.008 --> 53:00.443
by a bunch of gorillas.

53:00.475 --> 53:01.676
No offense.

53:01.709 --> 53:03.713
So, nobody knows
anything, huh?

53:05.948 --> 53:06.848
What do you think?

53:06.881 --> 53:08.383
I think you should kill them.

53:08.417 --> 53:09.786
I foresaw this deceit.

53:11.019 --> 53:11.854
Are you sure?

53:12.988 --> 53:15.290
This could be
the chain reaction.

53:18.526 --> 53:19.361
Okay.

53:20.528 --> 53:21.664
Kill them both.

53:21.696 --> 53:22.664
Waste no more time here.

53:22.698 --> 53:23.499
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

53:23.531 --> 53:24.600
What about the case?

53:24.633 --> 53:25.635
What about the case?

53:27.035 --> 53:28.703
I know where it's at.

53:28.736 --> 53:29.805
I can get it for you.

53:31.307 --> 53:33.042
I know the girl who has it.

53:33.075 --> 53:34.477
You need me.

53:34.510 --> 53:35.711
All right.

53:35.743 --> 53:37.079
You bought yourself
five more minutes.

53:39.914 --> 53:41.316
Are you all right?

53:42.785 --> 53:44.420
It's been a very
interesting day.

53:44.452 --> 53:46.187
I'd love to tell
you all about it

53:46.220 --> 53:48.456
but right now I really
need to find Lynese.

53:48.490 --> 53:50.392
Have you seen her
in here tonight?

53:50.426 --> 53:51.594
Actually I have.

53:51.627 --> 53:52.995
Her and a couple guys
came here earlier

53:53.028 --> 53:54.062
and went to the back.

53:54.095 --> 53:54.996
Thanks.

53:55.030 --> 53:56.698
Whoa, where you going?

53:56.731 --> 53:57.999
I have to find her.

53:58.033 --> 53:59.702
You can't just go into the
back without an employee.

53:59.734 --> 54:00.635
I'll go and find her.

54:00.669 --> 54:01.871
Hey, Jill, cover for me.

54:01.903 --> 54:03.572
Yeah, sure.

54:03.606 --> 54:04.774
I can find it for you, okay?

54:04.807 --> 54:06.442
I'll get you your money.

54:06.475 --> 54:07.477
You need me.

54:12.548 --> 54:13.515
Yeah.

54:13.548 --> 54:15.050
The thing is,

54:15.084 --> 54:17.486
I don't really have a lot
of options here, Hacker.

54:19.153 --> 54:20.055
No, you can't kill me.

54:20.089 --> 54:21.591
You can't kill me!

54:33.901 --> 54:35.437
Oh, shit.

54:35.470 --> 54:36.371
Seriously?

54:36.405 --> 54:38.441
Nobody locked the goddamn door?

54:38.473 --> 54:39.675
Amanda?

54:39.707 --> 54:42.377
You
know this one too?

54:44.780 --> 54:45.982
What the fuck was that?

54:46.015 --> 54:47.083
You don't wanna know.

54:47.115 --> 54:48.149
Are you two crazy?

54:48.182 --> 54:50.385
I'll explain later, I promise.

55:06.669 --> 55:08.371
Hey, not the
face, not the face!

55:11.406 --> 55:12.475
Let her go.

55:12.508 --> 55:14.710
Honey, help me!

55:14.743 --> 55:16.245
Those two are in it together.

55:16.278 --> 55:17.913
She's lying.

55:17.946 --> 55:19.248
Her too.

55:19.281 --> 55:20.716
No, Vito.

55:20.749 --> 55:22.919
I've seen bad things for
you if you let this persist.

55:26.354 --> 55:27.823
No more fortunes from you.

55:29.992 --> 55:31.160
Clear everyone out of here.

55:31.193 --> 55:32.729
Make sure those
three stick around.

55:38.499 --> 55:40.235
I need to check available
funds in an account.

55:40.269 --> 55:44.473
Account number is
0-5-3-6-7-8-1-3.

55:45.941 --> 55:47.443
Amount, 100 dollars.

55:51.814 --> 55:52.649
Thank you.

55:54.149 --> 55:55.351
And we were shot at

55:55.383 --> 55:57.786
and this big guy in a black car

55:57.819 --> 55:59.821
has been chasing us ever since.

56:02.591 --> 56:04.326
Sounds like Hacker's
gotten the two of you

56:04.359 --> 56:05.761
into a lot of trouble today.

56:06.995 --> 56:08.197
Where's the case at now?

56:10.064 --> 56:12.834
We threw it at the big guy
when he was running us down.

56:12.868 --> 56:14.636
I guess he has it.

56:16.604 --> 56:17.973
So he has the case.

56:18.874 --> 56:19.709
I would assume.

56:21.042 --> 56:22.343
You're going to have to forget

56:22.377 --> 56:24.280
that any of this ever happened.

56:24.312 --> 56:25.448
I mean that too.

56:25.481 --> 56:27.850
Do not give me a reason
to hunt you down.

56:27.883 --> 56:29.618
I completely understand.

56:29.651 --> 56:30.486
Thank you, Vito.

56:32.254 --> 56:33.856
You're a good kid, Amanda.

56:33.888 --> 56:35.992
Don't worry about Calm,
I'll call him off.

56:37.225 --> 56:39.127
Now the two of you
better get out of here.

56:40.629 --> 56:42.264
Don't worry about them.

56:42.296 --> 56:43.698
Your job is to find the case.

56:43.731 --> 56:47.168
Now just do your job
and bring it back.

56:47.202 --> 56:48.136
I have my reasons.

57:08.122 --> 57:09.557
What are you still doing here?

57:09.591 --> 57:10.726
I wanted some answers.

57:10.758 --> 57:12.293
To what?

57:12.327 --> 57:13.963
Don't give me any of your
bullshit stories, Lynese.

57:13.995 --> 57:15.664
I know you better than that.

57:15.696 --> 57:16.531
Easy boy.

57:17.765 --> 57:19.635
What do the two of you
got going on with Vito?

57:19.667 --> 57:20.736
We aren't involved.

57:22.271 --> 57:24.140
Don't you think you're in
over your head with Vito?

57:24.173 --> 57:27.609
Hustling them is a far cry
from what you're getting into.

57:27.642 --> 57:29.244
Me?

57:29.278 --> 57:30.913
It was all a
big misunderstand.

57:32.247 --> 57:33.082
I'm sure.

57:43.457 --> 57:44.325
It was her idea!

57:44.359 --> 57:46.194
Son of a bitch!

57:49.097 --> 57:51.267
You were supposed to wait
until he had the ticket!

57:51.300 --> 57:52.368
Bring the car around front.

57:52.401 --> 57:54.169
I need to get out of here fast.

57:54.202 --> 57:55.036
Yes, sir.

57:57.506 --> 57:58.841
Make sure the
place is spotless

57:58.874 --> 58:00.309
when you're done with them.

58:24.566 --> 58:27.169
I'm just gonna give
you two a little privacy.

58:37.879 --> 58:39.948
So you work for Vito?

58:39.981 --> 58:42.584
No, I work for Dominick's.

58:42.618 --> 58:44.253
Vito just happens
to own the place.

58:44.285 --> 58:45.653
Not too big of a fan.

58:45.687 --> 58:47.156
But the money I can't beat.

58:47.189 --> 58:48.624
School is just too expensive.

58:48.656 --> 58:50.425
What
are you studying?

58:50.459 --> 58:51.694
Journalism.

58:51.727 --> 58:53.629
Another month of school
and I'm off to New York.

58:53.662 --> 58:55.263
New York?

58:55.296 --> 58:56.865
Why?

58:56.899 --> 58:58.100
Why not?

58:58.133 --> 59:00.236
You plan on staying in
Syndicate after school?

59:00.269 --> 59:02.271
I hadn't really
thought about it.

59:04.805 --> 59:06.641
What do you do again?

59:06.675 --> 59:10.011
I'm an artist, I guess.

59:10.044 --> 59:10.879
Nice.

59:11.747 --> 59:13.616
Thanks for giving us a ride.

59:15.082 --> 59:18.553
So do you think I
can call you sometime?

59:19.553 --> 59:21.490
You mean, like, later?

59:21.522 --> 59:25.026
Yeah, unless you have
a boyfriend or something.

59:25.060 --> 59:25.895
Oh, no.

59:26.761 --> 59:28.964
I mean, yes, well, sort of.

59:30.131 --> 59:33.269
There was something
but it's nothing now.

59:33.301 --> 59:34.736
Yes.

59:34.769 --> 59:37.505
Here, put your number in
my phone and I'll text you.

59:42.377 --> 59:44.346
Talk to you soon?

59:44.379 --> 59:46.348
Yeah.

59:46.381 --> 59:47.450
Text you later.

01:00:03.832 --> 01:00:06.001
Drop them deep in the river
where no one will find them.

01:00:06.033 --> 01:00:06.868
Yes, sir.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.972
Hold on, you two.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:16.178
Those two aren't the only
ones hitting the river.

01:00:17.345 --> 01:00:18.746
You.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:19.982
You're gonna turn on me?

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:21.250
You better kill me.

01:00:21.283 --> 01:00:22.885
I'm gonna lay it
out for you, Vito.

01:00:22.917 --> 01:00:25.687
Your treatment of those loyal
to you is about to cost you.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:28.389
But I'll let you live if you
give me all of your accounts.

01:00:28.423 --> 01:00:30.959
I want it all and
I'll let you live.

01:00:30.993 --> 01:00:32.628
I'll drop you both off
in the middle of nowhere

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.429
because by the time
you return home,

01:00:34.463 --> 01:00:36.031
I'll be long gone.

01:00:36.064 --> 01:00:38.968
You won't have access to
resources to hunt me down anymore.

01:00:39.001 --> 01:00:41.035
You think I'm gonna
turn over all my accounts

01:00:41.068 --> 01:00:43.271
to a lowlife criminal like you?

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:44.606
I'm holding two guns on you

01:00:44.638 --> 01:00:47.408
and your choice of
words is to insult me?

01:00:47.441 --> 01:00:49.043
Not a wise move. You know what?

01:00:49.077 --> 01:00:50.678
I'll find them myself.

01:00:58.153 --> 01:00:58.955
Duvall?

01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:01.122
Howdy, boss.

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:05.194
Where the hell
did you come from?

01:01:06.627 --> 01:01:08.430
Word on the street is that
Dominick and Calm might flip,

01:01:08.463 --> 01:01:11.232
so thought you
could use the help.

01:01:11.265 --> 01:01:13.836
I guess this makes
up for the briefcase.

01:01:13.868 --> 01:01:15.771
Well, almost.

01:01:15.803 --> 01:01:17.606
Put him in the back
with the others.

01:01:22.144 --> 01:01:23.278
Do you believe
this fucking guy?

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.280
No thank you, no welcome
home, no nothing.

01:01:25.312 --> 01:01:26.682
What'd you expect, a hug?

01:01:49.303 --> 01:01:50.838
Foster, what's going on?

01:01:50.872 --> 01:01:52.741
Hey,
Amanda, it's Foster.

01:01:52.774 --> 01:01:54.676
Yes, I know, I have caller ID.

01:01:54.709 --> 01:01:55.743
Of course you do.

01:01:55.776 --> 01:01:57.412
Listen, this is an emergency.

01:01:57.446 --> 01:01:58.747
Calm has Harrison.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:01:59.580
What?

01:01:59.613 --> 01:02:00.816
How? Where?

01:02:00.848 --> 01:02:02.216
I don't
know the details yet.

01:02:02.249 --> 01:02:03.651
He's taking him to Vito's.

01:02:03.685 --> 01:02:05.687
Our plan may have
backfired a little bit.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.455
I think Calm believes
Vito set him up.

01:02:07.488 --> 01:02:09.925
We need to help Harrison.

01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:11.059
I'm going to get Lynese.

01:02:11.093 --> 01:02:12.594
We'll meet you there.

01:02:16.497 --> 01:02:18.300
Calm,
what're you doing here?

01:02:18.332 --> 01:02:19.535
Where's Vito?

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.604
Why are
you doing this, Calm?

01:02:23.004 --> 01:02:23.806
Shit.

01:02:26.073 --> 01:02:27.008
I'm here.

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.911
I thought I was gonna
have to shoot this kid

01:02:28.943 --> 01:02:30.711
to get your attention.

01:02:30.745 --> 01:02:32.013
There's no need for that.

01:02:32.046 --> 01:02:33.881
What do you want with my son?

01:02:33.914 --> 01:02:35.283
I don't want him at all.

01:02:35.316 --> 01:02:36.151
I'm after you

01:02:37.017 --> 01:02:38.786
and the case!

01:02:38.819 --> 01:02:39.655
The case?

01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:43.524
I know what's inside,
so don't play stupid.

01:02:43.557 --> 01:02:45.493
How about you just let him go

01:02:45.526 --> 01:02:46.727
and then we'll talk?

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.297
I've had enough talk
from you over the years.

01:02:51.332 --> 01:02:54.102
Exactly what did
I ever do to you?

01:02:54.135 --> 01:02:56.471
You've been getting
sloppy old man.

01:02:56.504 --> 01:02:59.640
That stupid psychic was one
of your biggest mistakes

01:02:59.673 --> 01:03:02.076
but trying to sell
me out was worse.

01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:03.611
And I hate that fucking jacket!

01:03:24.633 --> 01:03:26.201
Okay.

01:03:26.234 --> 01:03:27.336
I think I have a plan.

01:03:30.705 --> 01:03:32.174
Where the hell did Foster go?

01:03:49.024 --> 01:03:49.925
Fuck.

01:03:49.957 --> 01:03:50.858
Sorry about that.

01:03:50.892 --> 01:03:51.859
Had to make a phone call.

01:03:51.892 --> 01:03:53.394
How are we supposed to get in?

01:03:53.428 --> 01:03:54.830
Relax, I got a key.

01:03:58.066 --> 01:04:00.301
What're you doing here?

01:04:00.334 --> 01:04:01.836
Relax, I'm not here for you.

01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:04.173
I'm here for my brother.

01:04:04.205 --> 01:04:06.575
I see you brought your
little buddy with you, Foster.

01:04:07.908 --> 01:04:09.077
Where's the other one?

01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:10.312
What other one?

01:04:10.345 --> 01:04:11.680
The little blonde girl.

01:04:11.713 --> 01:04:13.515
A. Ross.

01:04:13.548 --> 01:04:14.750
I'm here.

01:04:14.783 --> 01:04:16.151
Are you okay?

01:04:16.184 --> 01:04:17.051
He's fine.

01:04:18.053 --> 01:04:19.455
This is what you're after.

01:04:20.854 --> 01:04:21.656
Lay it down.

01:04:21.689 --> 01:04:23.258
I'm taking it with me.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:25.227
That's what all this is about?

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.696
It's worth 500
thousand dollars.

01:04:27.729 --> 01:04:29.265
It's yours if you let us go.

01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:31.767
You're an idiot.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.401
I am holding a gun on you.

01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:36.070
What the hell is
she doing up there?

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:37.473
Trying not to get killed.

01:05:12.874 --> 01:05:14.276
Couldn't stand you anyway.

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:15.410
Everybody lied to me.

01:05:28.957 --> 01:05:30.359
Do it.

01:05:30.392 --> 01:05:31.227
Do it!

01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:57.218
Oh no.

01:05:57.252 --> 01:05:58.687
Oh no, wrong way.

01:06:02.022 --> 01:06:04.191
Just give me the damn ticket.

01:06:04.225 --> 01:06:07.129
Promise you won't kill us.

01:06:07.162 --> 01:06:10.564
If I wanted you to
be dead, you'd be dead.

01:06:10.597 --> 01:06:12.500
Don't tempt me.

01:06:12.533 --> 01:06:15.970
You want her, you
gotta get through me.

01:06:23.544 --> 01:06:26.648
That's it, kid,
give me the ticket.

01:06:28.415 --> 01:06:29.318
I don't have it.

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:30.484
Hey!

01:06:44.832 --> 01:06:46.334
The ticket!

01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:56.144
What the fuck?

01:06:56.176 --> 01:06:57.345
What the fuck?

01:07:02.484 --> 01:07:03.452
Oh fuck.

01:07:03.484 --> 01:07:04.586
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:07:04.618 --> 01:07:06.153
Fuck, fuck.

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:26.140
Who called the Feds?

01:07:27.142 --> 01:07:27.975
That'll be me.

01:07:33.847 --> 01:07:35.383
Of course it was.

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:36.718
I wasn't about
to let my brother

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.754
in the hands of your
hired goon squad.

01:07:38.787 --> 01:07:40.187
You don't have anything on me,

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.023
just like all the other times.

01:07:43.624 --> 01:07:45.026
That's where you're wrong.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:47.763
How about a secret bank account?

01:07:47.796 --> 01:07:49.964
I'm sure the IRS would love
to hear about that one.

01:07:49.997 --> 01:07:52.633
I did some checking after
Amanda and Lynese left my place.

01:07:52.667 --> 01:07:54.435
Those numbers were more
than just blind luck.

01:07:54.468 --> 01:07:56.905
They are the numbers to
your secret bank account.

01:07:56.937 --> 01:07:59.240
No one knew the lottery ticked
worth 500 thousand dollars

01:07:59.274 --> 01:08:01.609
was really account numbers
with more than 10 million.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:04.278
Once again, Foster,

01:08:04.312 --> 01:08:07.214
I think your imagination's
run way with you.

01:08:07.247 --> 01:08:09.617
What account are
you talking about?

01:08:09.651 --> 01:08:10.486
We'll see.

01:08:11.919 --> 01:08:15.222
I've been looking forward
to this for a very long time.

01:08:15.256 --> 01:08:17.691
And who are you
supposed to be?

01:08:17.725 --> 01:08:19.227
I'm Diana Watson's daughter.

01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:23.464
Vito Martino, you're
under arrest for

01:08:23.497 --> 01:08:25.234
suspicion of tax fraud.

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:28.904
Let's just hope your boss
doesn't find out about this.

01:08:28.935 --> 01:08:30.772
Don't worry, I won't tell.

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:33.542
Try not
to get shot over it.

01:08:34.975 --> 01:08:36.211
Thank you for your help.

01:08:36.243 --> 01:08:37.880
Thanks for the
account numbers.

01:08:52.392 --> 01:08:54.095
You beat up a hired killer.

01:08:54.127 --> 01:08:56.363
I didn't actually beat him up.

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:34.770
Location's disabled.

01:09:35.868 --> 01:09:37.939
Can't have anyone
tracking me, now can we?

01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:41.810
Only the paranoid survive.

01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:47.147
Vito's gone the way of Capone

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.618
but your former rival's
still out there.

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:51.720
Vito got what he deserved.

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:53.421
The information you requested.

01:09:54.622 --> 01:09:56.091
I think this will
complete our deal.

01:09:57.458 --> 01:09:59.060
Nice doing
business with you.

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:00.928
Keep an eye out for Calm.

01:10:00.962 --> 01:10:03.999
I have a feeling he has
some unfinished business.

01:10:04.031 --> 01:10:05.699
It's only a matter of
time before he realized

01:10:05.732 --> 01:10:07.968
it wasn't Vito who set him up.

01:10:08.002 --> 01:10:09.471
Do I look worried?

01:10:09.503 --> 01:10:12.073
I'm not, he has
to find me first.

01:10:12.105 --> 01:10:13.274
See you, Foster.

01:10:13.307 --> 01:10:14.909
Stay out of trouble.

01:11:08.327 --> 01:11:13.327
