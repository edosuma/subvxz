02:36.880 --> 02:40.475
Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour
of muddy puddles.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.869
Her birthmark, the colour of poo.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.000
It was Saturday afternoon
and she was bored.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.959
Mary wished she had a friend
to play piggybacks with.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.351
Mary's mood ring, which she'd found
in a cereal box, was grey

03:21.480 --> 03:23.680
which, according to the chart,

03:23.680 --> 03:30.640
meant she was either pensive,
unconsciously ambitious or hungry.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.600
Her only friends were 'The Noblets'
from her favourite cartoon.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.920
They weren't the real ones
you bought in the shops

03:37.920 --> 03:42.160
but fake ones she had to make herself
from shells, gumnuts, pompoms

03:42.160 --> 03:47.080
and the chicken bones salvaged
from Friday night's takeaway.

03:47.080 --> 03:51.080
She had to make all her own toys,
and her favourites were Shrinkies -

03:51.080 --> 03:55.232
potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.160
Mary's father, Noel Norman Dinkle,

04:02.160 --> 04:05.440
worked in a factory,
attaching the strings to tea bags.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.320
At show and tell, she told the class

04:09.320 --> 04:14.440
he could get as many free tea bags
as he wanted.

04:14.440 --> 04:18.200
Her favourite tea bag was Earl Grey.

04:18.200 --> 04:22.360
She loved saying 'Earl Grey'

04:22.360 --> 04:27.520
and would like one day to marry
someone called Earl Grey.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.951
They would live
in a castle in Scotland,

04:31.080 --> 04:33.560
have 9 babies, 2 ducks...

04:33.560 --> 04:35.360
..and a dog called Kevin.

04:37.760 --> 04:41.480
Noel's hobby was to sit in his shed
and drink Baileys lrish Cream

04:41.480 --> 04:46.480
and stuff birds he'd found
on the side of the freeway.

04:46.480 --> 04:53.080
Mary wished he'd spend more time
with her and less with his dead friends.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.720
She also wished she had
some brothers and sisters.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.110
Her mother had told her
she was 'an accident'.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.000
How could someone be an accident?

05:04.000 --> 05:08.040
Grandpoppy Ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate

05:08.040 --> 05:11.350
and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.480
Grandpoppy Ralph
had smelt like pickled onions

05:16.480 --> 05:21.600
and had been a member of the Frankston
Ice Breakers for 51 years.

05:23.640 --> 05:26.760
They swam in winter to feel alive.

05:26.760 --> 05:32.800
Grandpoppy Ralph had said
it made his nipples erect.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.400
He had died the year before, aged 74,

05:35.400 --> 05:40.720
and his best mate, Ken,
had recited a poem in his honour.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.080
Born in a barn
in the hills of Boronia,

05:44.080 --> 05:45.880
Ralph lived a long life,

05:45.880 --> 05:49.360
then died of pneumonia.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.270
Mary missed him

05:50.360 --> 05:54.880
and often wondered
why he had drunk ammonia.

05:54.880 --> 05:57.760
A lot of things puzzled Mary

05:57.760 --> 06:01.958
especially her mother,
Vera Lorraine Dinkle.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.960
To Mary, Vera always seemed wobbly.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.793
A pretty vicious ball.
And he's out!

06:10.080 --> 06:13.868
Vera liked listening
to the cricket while baking

06:13.960 --> 06:17.920
and her main ingredient
was always sherry.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.000
3/44. And Thompson 2/15...

06:21.000 --> 06:23.880
She told Mary it was a type of tea
for grown-ups

06:23.880 --> 06:26.760
that needed constant testing.

06:26.760 --> 06:30.435
Just out of the reach
of the lead. 6/96 England.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.760
Mary thought her mother tested
the sherry... way too much.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.680
Mary also couldn't understand
why Vera was always 'borrowing'.

06:47.680 --> 06:52.600
Yesterday, she borrowed
some fish fingers from Aisle 6.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.718
She told Mary she put things
up her dress to save on plastic bags.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.838
Vera was indeed a complicated soul.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.114
Mary stopped daydreaming

07:17.200 --> 07:19.873
and went and fetched
her pet rooster from the rain.

07:22.880 --> 07:26.120
Her father had found the rooster
on the side of the freeway

07:26.120 --> 07:30.160
after it had fallen off the back
of a slaughter truck.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.151
She named him Ethel.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.032
It was time to watch 'The Noblets'.
She adored 'The Noblets'

07:40.160 --> 07:43.948
because everyone was brown,
lived in a teapot

07:44.040 --> 07:47.640
and had oodles of friends.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.360
There was nothing nicer,
Mary thought to herself,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.960
than the smell of a wet rooster...

07:52.960 --> 07:54.712
..the sound of rain on the roof

07:54.800 --> 07:59.080
and the taste of sweetened
condensed milk straight from the can

07:59.080 --> 08:03.198
while watching your favourite cartoon.

08:46.600 --> 08:51.116
Meanwhile, a man called Max Horowitz
also watched 'The Noblets'.

08:53.920 --> 08:58.200
Max's small television
had picture but no sound.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.720
His big television, sound but no picture.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.000
He was 44 and liked 'The Noblets'

09:05.000 --> 09:08.760
as they lived in a delineated
and articulated social structure

09:08.760 --> 09:11.960
with constant adherent conformity

09:11.960 --> 09:15.714
and also because they had
oodles of friends.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.678
Max had trouble sleeping

09:19.800 --> 09:25.880
and had spent the night watching
television and catching fish food.

09:25.880 --> 09:30.351
He noted to himself it was the sixth fly
he'd caught this evening.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.760
He wondered if he should go to bed
and count sheep

09:37.760 --> 09:41.440
or have one more chocolate hotdog.

09:41.440 --> 09:45.720
He thought he'd try both
but it didn't work.

09:45.720 --> 09:51.960
It had been 6 hours and 12 minutes since
Henry VIII had passed away.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.200
And Henry's death
had thrown Max's life into disarray.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.240
It had become asymmetrical

09:58.240 --> 10:01.755
and the sooner
he got a new fish, the better.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.315
Tomorrow he would go to the pet store
and get another Henry -

10:08.400 --> 10:10.197
Henry IX.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.600
Next.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.000
It was shopping day

10:30.000 --> 10:36.880
and Mary sat patiently while her mother
'borrowed' some envelopes.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.520
To fill in time, she scanned the room

10:39.520 --> 10:42.400
and counted how many things
were brown.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.760
There was sticky tape, rubber bands

10:44.760 --> 10:49.160
and a phone book with a picture
of a lady standing in a brown lake

10:49.160 --> 10:51.196
with her hand on fire.

10:52.280 --> 10:57.800
People had weird names in America,
Mary Daisy Dinkle thought to herself.

10:57.800 --> 11:02.600
Funny-sounding people called
Rockefeller and Finkelstein.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.840
She wondered what they looked like,
how old they were

11:05.840 --> 11:11.560
and if they were married, wore glasses,
or had found babies in their beer.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.680
Maybe in the USA
they found babies elsewhere.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.280
They drank a lot of cola.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.640
Maybe they found them in cans.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.360
But, no, they wouldn't fit
through the hole.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.720
Mary had an idea.

11:27.720 --> 11:33.640
She would write to one of the Americans
and ask where babies came from.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.349
She chose a Mr M Horowitz.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.960
Aarrgh, Mrs Dinkle!

11:48.960 --> 11:53.238
Come back here, Vera Dinkle!
You come back here!

11:53.760 --> 11:54.954
Aaarghhhh!

11:56.280 --> 11:59.040
Dear Mr M Horowitz,

11:59.040 --> 12:02.960
my name is Mary Daisy Dinkle

12:02.960 --> 12:08.671
and I am 8 years old,
3 months and 9 days.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.240
My favourite colour is brown

12:11.240 --> 12:15.160
and my favourite food
is sweetened condensed milk

12:15.160 --> 12:18.680
followed closely by chocolate.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.480
I have a rooster called Ethel
that looks like this.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.160
He doesn't lay eggs but will one day.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.876
My mother likes smoking,
cricket and sherry

12:30.960 --> 12:36.280
and my father likes playing in his shed
with dead birds.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.000
Where do babies come from
in America?

12:39.000 --> 12:41.040
Do they come from cola cans?

12:41.040 --> 12:45.352
In Australia
they are found in beer glasses.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.960
Here is a drawing of me.

12:46.960 --> 12:50.157
I can't draw ears proper
but I'm good at teeth.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.520
It would be great if you could write back
and be my friend.

12:55.520 --> 12:59.354
Yours 'sincerealy', Mary Daisy Dinkle.

13:00.440 --> 13:05.560
PS. I hope you like the chocolate bar
I'm also sending.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.198
It's called a Cherry Ripe.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.955
Goodbye, letter. Don't forget to write.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.280
Max hated Thursdays -

13:57.280 --> 14:01.159
the day of his weekly
Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.600
And tonight he'd felt
especially unsettled

14:04.600 --> 14:09.080
because he'd eaten two chocolate
hotdogs on his way there.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.240
OK, class...

14:10.240 --> 14:13.630
Eating chocolate was breaking the rules.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.600
He'd found the night
even more unbearable

14:16.600 --> 14:19.400
because of Marjorie Butterworth's
strange glances.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.958
Class dismissed.

14:21.040 --> 14:26.560
Max had trouble understanding
non-verbal signals.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.189
Flirting was as foreign to him
as jogging.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.235
Max found most people very confusing.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.120
But little did Max realise

14:42.120 --> 14:46.511
his night was about to become
even more confusing and cryptic.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.309
Hmm.

14:53.760 --> 15:01.269
He read Mary's letter four times
and then did what he normally did

15:01.360 --> 15:04.750
whenever confronted
with something new and stressful.

15:14.880 --> 15:21.240
Max's fragile existence
had once again become unsettled.

15:21.240 --> 15:25.000
And after staring out of the window
for 18 hours

15:25.000 --> 15:27.080
he finally made a decision.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.760
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

15:50.760 --> 15:54.960
thank you for the letter,
which I opened and read at 9.17 pm

15:54.960 --> 15:59.715
after my Overeaters Anonymous class.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.600
I am trying to lose weight

16:01.600 --> 16:04.880
because my psychiatrist,
Dr Bernard Hazelhof,

16:04.880 --> 16:08.350
says a healthy body
equals a healthy mind.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.440
Ooooh!

16:10.440 --> 16:14.228
He says my mind is not that healthy.

16:14.320 --> 16:19.600
Your drawing is an interesting
visual portrayal of yourself.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.520
I have never met anyone from Australia.

16:22.520 --> 16:25.432
Firstly, I will answer your question.

16:28.280 --> 16:33.360
Unfortunately, in America,
babies are not found in cola cans.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.080
I asked my mother when I was four

16:36.080 --> 16:41.234
and she said they came from eggs
laid by rabbis.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.680
If you aren't Jewish,
they're laid by Catholic nuns.

16:44.680 --> 16:49.480
If you're an atheist,
they're laid by dirty, lonely prostitutes.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.320
So this is where babies come from
in America.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.640
I share my home with a fish,

16:55.640 --> 17:01.240
some snails, whom I have named
after famous scientists...

17:01.240 --> 17:05.720
..a parakeet called Mr Biscuit

17:05.720 --> 17:08.480
and, finally, a cat called Hal.

17:08.480 --> 17:14.920
'Hal' is an abbreviation for halitosis,
from which he suffers.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.359
He followed me home
after a gang of children

17:17.359 --> 17:19.400
shot his eye out with a beebee gun.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.240
Do you have a pet kangaroo?

17:23.240 --> 17:27.280
When I was born, my father
left my mother and me on a kibbutz.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.600
She shot herself with my uncle's gun
when I was six.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.280
Do you like chocolate hotdogs?

17:34.280 --> 17:39.200
I invented the recipe for them
and can send it to you.

17:39.200 --> 17:45.360
When I was young, I invented
an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.440
My psychiatrist says
I don't need him anymore

17:48.440 --> 17:52.035
so he just sits in the corner and reads.

17:56.120 --> 18:01.840
Last week I picked up
128 cigarette butts.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.880
People are always littering in New York.

18:04.880 --> 18:09.440
I do not understand
why people break laws.

18:09.440 --> 18:12.560
Butts are bad
because they wash out to sea

18:12.560 --> 18:17.680
and fish smoke them
and become nicotine dependent.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.080
I am just joking because, of course,

18:21.080 --> 18:25.920
it is impossible for a cigarette
to remain lit underwater.

18:25.920 --> 18:30.391
Also, fish do not have pockets
to keep cigarette lighters in.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.360
I am 44 years old

18:37.360 --> 18:40.840
and have 8 tracksuits
the same colour and size.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.400
I weigh 352 lb...

18:46.400 --> 18:48.400
Ooooh!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.868
..and am as tall as a 6-foot tree.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.400
Welcome to the New York Lottery!

18:53.400 --> 18:55.072
I enjoy entering the lottery

18:55.160 --> 18:58.760
and have chosen the same numbers
for 9 years.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.720
Those numbers are 3... 1

19:01.720 --> 19:03.720
5... 4

19:03.720 --> 19:05.680
6... 25

19:05.680 --> 19:07.240
9... 2

19:07.240 --> 19:08.720
11... 7

19:08.720 --> 19:10.920
And 12... 8

19:13.000 --> 19:15.160
Are you a winner?

19:15.160 --> 19:16.798
Or a loser?

19:16.880 --> 19:20.080
I have had many different jobs
during my life.

19:20.080 --> 19:25.840
My first job was collecting
subway tokens in the subway.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.200
My second job was at Yiddel's
Gourmet Kosher Supplies

19:29.200 --> 19:33.720
where I worked at the machine that made
pre-packaged noodle kugels.

19:33.720 --> 19:37.360
I was born Jewish
and used to believe in God

19:37.360 --> 19:38.873
but I've since read many books

19:38.960 --> 19:43.360
that have proven God
is just a figment of my imagination.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.120
People like to believe in God because
it answers complicated questions

19:47.120 --> 19:50.560
like where did the universe come from,

19:50.560 --> 19:51.760
do worms go to heaven...

19:51.760 --> 19:53.240
do worms go to heaven...

19:53.240 --> 19:56.277
..and why do old ladies have blue hair?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.120
Even though I'm an atheist,

19:58.120 --> 20:02.520
I still wear my yarmulke
as it keeps my brain warm.

20:02.520 --> 20:08.680
My third job was for a company
that printed logos on novelty items.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.990
I worked at the frisbee printing machine.

20:12.080 --> 20:17.360
A frisbee is a circular plastic disc
that people throw at each other.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.032
It is like a boomerang

20:19.840 --> 20:22.912
but it does not come back.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.749
My fourth job was when
I was called up for jury duty.

20:27.840 --> 20:33.280
I didn't get paid much
but got free cookies and coffee.

20:33.280 --> 20:36.716
Jurors are outstanding members
of the community

20:36.800 --> 20:39.520
who haven't murdered anybody.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.160
I made it to the short list

20:41.160 --> 20:44.516
for a trial where a man
killed all his friends

20:44.600 --> 20:47.560
at his own surprise birthday party.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.240
Unfortunately, I didn't get selected
because they found out

20:51.240 --> 20:53.640
I'd been a mental patient at one point.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.480
Have you ever been hang gliding?

20:57.480 --> 21:01.040
My fifth job was as a garbage collector.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.680
I got to clean up after litterbugs
and didn't have to talk to anybody.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.280
Sometimes I used to pretend
I was an intergalactical robot.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.960
This is 911.
Your call has been placed in a queue.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.000
One time the police took me in
for questioning

21:26.000 --> 21:29.560
but let me go when they decided
I wasn't a threat to anybody

21:29.560 --> 21:31.560
except myself.

21:33.720 --> 21:39.280
The sixth job I had
was for the United States Army

21:39.280 --> 21:42.840
in the stationery supply department.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.680
Because I am good with numbers

21:44.680 --> 21:48.880
I had to work out how many
ballpoint pens the Army needed.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.080
One day they did a security check

21:51.080 --> 21:54.840
and asked whether I was a member
of any radical groups.

21:54.840 --> 21:59.160
I told them I was a member of
the New York Science Fiction Fan Club.

21:59.160 --> 22:04.040
They said this didn't count
but dismissed me anyway.

22:04.040 --> 22:09.240
Fortunately, I did not remember
to tell them I was once a communist.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.629
Have you ever been a communist?

22:12.480 --> 22:16.840
Have you ever been attacked by a crow
or similar large bird?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.600
When I was 9, a crow attacked me
on my way to school.

22:24.600 --> 22:28.000
I had to have three stitches

22:28.000 --> 22:32.073
and in spring I now wear a helmet
with eyes I have painted on.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.960
People laugh at me
when I wear my helmet.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.200
I'm not sure why.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.800
People often confuse me
but I try not to let them worry me.

22:44.320 --> 22:47.560
New York is a very busy
and noisy place.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.080
I would prefer to live
somewhere much quieter

22:50.080 --> 22:52.355
Iike the moon.

22:52.440 --> 22:58.400
I don't like crowds, bright lights,
sudden noises or strong smells.

22:58.400 --> 23:01.120
New York has all these

23:01.120 --> 23:02.880
especially the smells.

23:04.080 --> 23:07.600
I often wear nose and ear plugs
when I go outside.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.800
It helps keep me calm.

23:10.800 --> 23:16.320
I find humans interesting but I have
trouble understanding them.

23:16.320 --> 23:21.155
I think, however,
I will understand and trust you.

23:22.680 --> 23:27.320
You appear very happy and I think
you would smell like a shrimp

23:27.320 --> 23:30.551
as I know Australia
has a lot of shrimps.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.280
Can you speed-read?

23:34.280 --> 23:37.560
I have taught myself to read
two pages at once -

23:37.560 --> 23:40.680
one eyeball per page.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.000
I have to go now

23:42.000 --> 23:44.960
even though I have not told you
about my 7th job,

23:44.960 --> 23:47.720
in a condom factory.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.360
Write back soon.

23:49.360 --> 23:55.800
Your American friend,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

23:55.800 --> 24:00.560
PS. Please find enclosed
a photo from one of those booths.

24:00.560 --> 24:04.360
PPS. Thank you for the Cherry Ripe

24:04.360 --> 24:07.800
and I am glad you like chocolate
as much as I do.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.640
I have never eaten
sweetened condensed milk

24:10.640 --> 24:13.760
but I will try some this week.

24:13.760 --> 24:18.231
PPPS. I have never used a condom.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.276
Gey gezunterheyt.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.760
Max hoped Mary would write again.

24:25.760 --> 24:28.680
He'd always wanted a friend.

24:28.680 --> 24:35.360
A friend that wasn't invisible,
a pet or rubber figurine.

24:35.360 --> 24:40.160
He counted the stars and wondered
how many days, hours, minutes

24:40.160 --> 24:44.676
it would take his letter
to reach Australia.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.550
Vera was not impressed...

24:53.880 --> 24:55.520
Aaaarrgh!

24:55.520 --> 24:58.880
..not impressed at all.

24:58.880 --> 25:04.680
This nutcase would not be her daughter's
penfriend, she thought.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.520
There was enough ugliness in the world.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.160
Mary would be home from school
in an hour -

25:10.160 --> 25:14.880
enough time for another cup of tea
and a bit of cricket to soothe the nerves

25:14.880 --> 25:19.200
and dissolve the memory of Max's letter
from her pickled mind.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.716
Yeah, he's out.
Unbelievable. 14. England 7/150.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.520
Stop! Wait!

25:56.520 --> 26:01.320
Hey, fellas, you got room
for one more bag?

26:01.320 --> 26:04.920
Sure, Mrs Dinkle. Hop in!

26:04.920 --> 26:06.911
Good one, Kevin!

26:07.440 --> 26:09.720
Aaaarghhh!

26:14.000 --> 26:17.072
Come on, Vera.
We 've got some other bags to pick up!

26:23.960 --> 26:27.396
Ooh. Hmm.

26:31.680 --> 26:34.040
Mary, is that all the rubbish?

26:34.040 --> 26:35.960
Yep!

26:35.960 --> 26:38.520
See ya, Toots!

26:38.520 --> 26:40.795
Sweet baby Jesus.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.635
Ooooah!

26:54.440 --> 26:59.309
Even though Max's letter smelt
like fish heads and orange peel,

26:59.440 --> 27:03.400
Mary drank his words
like a bowl of alphabet soup

27:03.400 --> 27:05.600
and hadn't been this excited

27:05.600 --> 27:10.799
since Grandpoppy Ralph
had found a coin up her nose.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.440
She wrote back immediately

27:12.440 --> 27:16.880
on some butchers' paper
she'd stolen from some chops.

27:16.880 --> 27:20.800
(Mary): Dear Max,
I'm so excited you've wroted back.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.680
I don't think my parents like you
so from now on

27:24.680 --> 27:27.840
send stuff to my neighbour Len Hislop

27:27.840 --> 27:32.755
at 26 Lamington Drive,
Mt Waverley.

27:32.880 --> 27:35.680
He's old with no legs.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.360
They got chew'd'ed off
in World War II

27:38.360 --> 27:42.160
when some Japanese peoples
kept him in a cage above piranhas.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.311
Piranhas are goldfish that have teeth.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.160
He's scared of outside,
which is a disease called homophobia.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.960
He's started giving me 50 cents a week
to get his mail.

28:01.120 --> 28:07.760
I'm saving to buy a castle in Scotland
and marry a man called Earl Grey.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.160
Do you get 'The Noblets' in America?

28:10.160 --> 28:14.000
Well, my favourite Noblet
is Vanity Noblet.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.640
He wants to be everyone's friend,
even the boys'!

28:19.640 --> 28:23.240
In your letter, you said
you had no friends.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.440
Well, neither do I.

28:25.440 --> 28:28.079
A-ha!

28:28.160 --> 28:31.948
Yesterday at school, Bernie Clifford weed
on my spam sandwich

28:32.040 --> 28:36.040
and called me 'poo face'
'cos of my birthmark.

28:36.040 --> 28:39.080
I wish I could peel it off like a bandaid.

28:39.080 --> 28:42.320
He also laughed
'cos I had no buttons.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.400
Ethel pecked them off

28:44.400 --> 28:48.760
and Mum couldn't thread a needle
'cos she'd been testing the sherry

28:48.760 --> 28:50.193
so she used pegs instead.

28:53.360 --> 28:59.674
When I got home, I climbed into
my secret place till dinner time.

28:59.760 --> 29:02.440
The other kids also laugh at my haircut.

29:02.440 --> 29:05.120
Dad has to cut my hair
because mum says

29:05.120 --> 29:08.120
real hairdressers
sell your hair to Chinamen

29:08.120 --> 29:09.640
who stuff mattresses.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.920
My teacher, Mrs Pendergast,
says I should smile more.

29:15.920 --> 29:20.675
I told my mum
and so she drawed a big smile on me.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.480
I don't think Mrs Pendergast
likes me anymore.

29:31.760 --> 29:36.440
I better go now.
My tears are smudgling my words.

29:36.440 --> 29:41.840
Your friend in Australia,
Mary Daisy Dinkle.

29:41.840 --> 29:48.800
PS. Have you ever been teased?
Can you help me?

29:48.800 --> 29:55.040
PSS. I've never been hang gliding
before or been a 'commune-ist'

29:55.040 --> 30:00.080
but would love a frisbee
and your recipe for chocolate hotdogs.

30:00.080 --> 30:06.960
PSSS. I'm sending you some
Australian chocolate, a pompom I made

30:06.960 --> 30:11.238
and a cake called a lamington,
which I was meant to eat for lunch.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.797
Have you ever been teased?

30:39.640 --> 30:41.870
Ooooooooooaaaahhhh!

30:42.000 --> 30:43.920
Mary's letter triggered memories

30:43.920 --> 30:47.480
Max had buried deep down in his shoes.

30:47.480 --> 30:51.678
We've got him cornered now.
Hey, Jew-boy, you 're gonna pay...

30:52.360 --> 30:56.956
Take this, Jew-boy, Jew-boy, Jew-boy.

30:59.560 --> 31:03.599
And as usual,
he coped in the only way he knew.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.720
And 36 chocolate hotdogs later...

31:17.360 --> 31:20.800
..and after only two hours sleep,

31:20.800 --> 31:27.760
Max's meltdown faded away
and an idea popped into his brain.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.593
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

31:32.680 --> 31:38.400
thank you for your letter, chocolate bar,
lamington and pompom.

31:38.400 --> 31:42.640
The chocolate got crushed, so I blended
the bits with milk and icecream

31:42.640 --> 31:45.154
and now I am drinking it right now.

31:48.120 --> 31:52.320
After much thought, I think I have
a solution to your teasing.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.356
Tell Bernie Clifford
your birthmark is made of chocolate,

31:57.120 --> 31:59.160
which means when you get to heaven

31:59.160 --> 32:02.680
you will be in charge
of all the chocolate.

32:02.680 --> 32:06.320
This of course is a lie -
I do not like lies -

32:06.320 --> 32:10.029
but in this case
I think it will be of benefit.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.880
I wish I could be in charge
of all the chocolate

32:13.880 --> 32:18.351
but, of course, I cannot
because of my atheism.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.040
My neighbour Ivy is also an atheist.

32:23.040 --> 32:29.280
She doesn't talk much but makes me
very good soup on Sunday nights.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.240
She is partly blind

32:31.240 --> 32:35.800
and sometimes I find her hair
in my soup. Eeugh!

32:35.800 --> 32:42.960
I do not tell her as Dr Bernard Hazelhof
says this would be i mpolite.

32:42.960 --> 32:46.480
Here is a list of what I eat
on the other nights.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.760
Mondays - Glicks Potato Knish,

32:48.760 --> 32:51.760
Tuesdays - Yiddels Noodle Kugel,

32:51.760 --> 32:55.000
Wednesdays -
Captain Salty's Fishstix,

32:55.000 --> 32:57.640
Thursdays - Y entls Cheezy Blintz

32:57.640 --> 33:00.916
and Fridays - chicken nuggets.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.400
On Saturday nights
I create my own recipes.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.760
Last week I invented
canned spaghetti hamburgers.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.040
Recipes are like
mathematical equations.

33:12.040 --> 33:18.720
Dr Bernard Hazelhof told me you should
never weigh more than your refrigerator

33:18.720 --> 33:23.440
and to never eat
anything bigger than your head.

33:23.440 --> 33:27.194
I once ate a watermelon
bigger than my head

33:27.320 --> 33:30.118
but not all at once.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.880
Do you have
any weight loss suggestions?

33:33.880 --> 33:36.880
My Overeaters Anonymous meetings
don't seem to be working

33:36.880 --> 33:39.880
and just make me tense.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.320
It would be good
if there was a 'Fat Fairy'.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.511
She would be a bit like the Tooth Fairy
but would suck out your fat.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.840
Ivy says she is only a 'little bit' blind
but I think she is very blind.

34:05.840 --> 34:09.469
She should get a cane
like other vision-impaired people.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.920
She could make the end pointy

34:12.920 --> 34:15.275
and collect rubbish at the same time.

34:16.719 --> 34:20.395
I think I will write a letter to the Mayor
and suggest this.

34:20.480 --> 34:24.040
He will be very impressed.

34:24.040 --> 34:29.120
Ivy says she doesn't need a cane
because she has a good sense of smell.

34:30.920 --> 34:36.000
She says she could find me
with her eyes stapled shut.

34:36.000 --> 34:40.232
She says I smell like liquorice
and old books.

34:44.120 --> 34:49.400
I think she smells like cough medicine
and urine.

34:49.400 --> 34:51.280
I have never told her this

34:51.280 --> 34:56.520
as Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
this would also be impolite.

35:00.480 --> 35:02.914
People often think
I am tactless and rude.

35:06.120 --> 35:12.280
I cannot understand how
being honest can be... improper.

35:12.280 --> 35:17.800
Maybe this is why
I don't have any friends

35:17.800 --> 35:19.518
of course except for you.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.800
A real friend has been
one of my three goals in life.

35:25.760 --> 35:31.835
The other two are to own every Noblet
and a lifetime supply of chocolate.

35:33.880 --> 35:38.200
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
it is good to have goals

35:38.200 --> 35:43.120
but not stupid ones like mine.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.350
I have now run out of things to tell you.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.360
Please, write soon.

35:50.360 --> 35:56.160
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

35:56.160 --> 36:00.440
PS. Do not worry about not smiling.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.880
My mouth hardly ever smiles

36:02.880 --> 36:07.520
but it does not mean
I am not smiling inside my brain.

36:09.440 --> 36:13.680
PPS. Please find enclosed a frisbee,

36:13.680 --> 36:16.880
some Chocolate Pop Rocks,
which you should eat with cola,

36:16.880 --> 36:22.637
and an illustration of a turtle
from one of my National Geographics.

36:22.720 --> 36:27.999
PPPS. Did you know that turtles
can breathe through their anuses?

36:32.200 --> 36:34.000
Dear Max,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.960
when I told Bernie Clifford

36:35.960 --> 36:39.720
I'll be in charge of all the chocolate
in heaven and he wouldn't get any,

36:39.720 --> 36:41.080
he cried.

36:42.720 --> 36:48.040
I also hide'd some dog's poo
in his bit of the sandpit.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.158
Your advice was great and
I've got a job delivering pamphlets

36:52.240 --> 36:55.320
so I can save to come and see you.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.360
I am sad to hear you are fat.

36:57.360 --> 37:01.558
Mum says I am fat too
and I'm growing up to be a heifer,

37:01.640 --> 37:05.280
which I think is a type of cow.

37:05.280 --> 37:09.600
Maybe you should only eat things
beginning with the letter of each day.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.000
On Mondays you could only eat

37:12.000 --> 37:17.520
milkshakes, marshmallows
and... mustard.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.080
Oooh!

37:22.600 --> 37:27.120
For my birthday, my Mum baked a cake
and Dad gave me a camera.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.520
I hope you like the photos I sent.

37:31.520 --> 37:34.840
The first one is of Ethel,
who ate some tinsel.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.360
The next one is one of myself

37:37.360 --> 37:42.320
after I ate the Chocolate Pop Rocks
with the cola, like you said.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.280
Next is Len.

37:44.280 --> 37:50.515
He's still trying hard not to be afraid of
outside and conquer his homophobia.

37:53.840 --> 37:57.400
The next one is of dad in his shed,

37:57.400 --> 38:00.560
and then one of the times
I covered mum

38:00.560 --> 38:04.520
while she was asleep in her stickers
that help her stop smoking.

38:04.520 --> 38:08.720
Next, when I got my slinky
caught in my hair.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.480
Then one of the times Sonny
digged up his wife, Cher.

38:13.480 --> 38:20.000
And, finally, a photo of my other
neighbour Damian Popodopolous.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
He's a Greek and smells like
lemon dishwashing liquid

38:24.000 --> 38:29.240
and his skin is smooth,
like the back of a spoon.

38:29.240 --> 38:35.200
Mum says he's a wog and has a stutter
and can't even say his own surname.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.240
She says you have to hit him
on the back of the head

38:40.240 --> 38:41.559
to get his words out.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.437
P-P-P-P... Popodopolous.

38:43.520 --> 38:47.680
I wish he was my boyfriend
and we can be in love and do sexing

38:47.680 --> 38:50.399
Iike Katherine Ramsay told me
behind the bike shed.

38:50.880 --> 38:53.560
She said it's when two people
go 'nuddy'

38:53.560 --> 38:56.028
and rub on each other to make babies.

38:57.040 --> 39:01.600
I told her she's a liar
and would go to hell and burn like toast

39:01.600 --> 39:04.360
'cos babies really come
from beer glasses

39:04.360 --> 39:08.512
and eggs laid by rabbits
and nuns and 'prosti-tubes'.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.560
She said ladies get knocked up

39:10.560 --> 39:13.600
and bake babies in their stomachs
for 2 years

39:13.600 --> 39:17.195
till they spurt out their 'vag-eye-ners'
with blood and tinned spaghetti.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.480
Have you got a girlfriend, Max,
or some wives?

39:21.480 --> 39:23.920
Have you done sexing?

39:23.920 --> 39:25.240
Valentine's Day is soon

39:25.240 --> 39:30.109
and I want to give Damian a present
so he can love me.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.240
Can you explain love
and how I can be 'lover'd'?

39:35.440 --> 39:38.920
Once again, Mary's letter
had triggered an anxiety attack.

39:40.320 --> 39:42.360
Max knew nothing about love.

39:42.360 --> 39:46.160
It was as foreign to him as scuba diving

39:46.160 --> 39:50.073
and he'd had an appalling history
of getting it all wrong.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.560
One Valentine's Day

39:52.560 --> 39:57.554
he'd given Zelda Glutnik a gift
he was sure was appropriate.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.909
The only companion
that had ever warmed Max's bed

40:07.000 --> 40:08.956
was his hot water bottle.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.680
Romance and love

40:11.680 --> 40:14.752
was a mysterious language
he'd given up on.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.600
If only Mary had asked
how a toaster works

40:18.600 --> 40:22.000
or asked for an explanation
of the Chaos theory.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.278
If only there was
a mathematical equation for love.

40:27.840 --> 40:31.469
He kept eating and thinking.

40:45.920 --> 40:51.720
But love was not like Max's
Rubik's Cube. It could not be solved.

40:51.720 --> 40:55.110
No matter how he analysed it,
the results were negative.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.320
Beat it, creep!

40:57.320 --> 41:00.600
He felt love but couldn't articulate it.

41:00.600 --> 41:04.798
Its logic was as foreign to him as...
as a salad sandwich.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.116
The stars made more sense.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.160
12, have you responded
to the call? Over.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.400
The anxiety and stress were too much.

41:22.400 --> 41:28.236
The inscrutability of love finally won,
and Max's brain gave in.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.520
He was diagnosed
with severe depression and obesity

41:40.520 --> 41:45.878
and spent the next 8 months
institutionalised and bedridden.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.080
They marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs

41:49.080 --> 41:52.595
and performed
the usual 'therapeutic' procedures.

41:57.800 --> 42:01.280
Meanwhile, Mary wondered and waited.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.918
Maybe Max's typewriter
had run out of ink.

42:06.240 --> 42:09.630
Maybe America had run out of ink.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.509
Maybe his pets had eaten him.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.990
Maybe it was her.

42:16.080 --> 42:20.471
Was she too demanding,
too boring, too... ugly?

42:28.280 --> 42:32.068
Filled with anger, confusion
and self-loathing,

42:32.160 --> 42:36.790
Mary tried to erase
the memory of her friend forever.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.394
Max had recovered.

43:25.480 --> 43:30.110
And life was balanced, safe
and symmetrical once again.

43:32.840 --> 43:37.160
But Mary still lingered in his mind.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.840
Half of him wanted to write to her
immediately.

43:39.840 --> 43:44.160
The other half didn't want to end up
a mental patient again.

43:44.160 --> 43:49.040
At least there was always Mr Ravioli
to be friends with.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.918
He was a much safer option.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.674
He wondered what Mary was doing
right now.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.280
But she was far from content

44:00.280 --> 44:06.116
and struggled on by herself,
saving her money for a rainy day.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.480
Life went on as usual for Max

44:15.480 --> 44:19.200
and even though he opted
for order and stability,

44:19.200 --> 44:22.510
misfortune was never far away.

44:50.640 --> 44:54.480
Luckily, his manslaughter charges
were dismissed

44:54.480 --> 44:57.320
because he was labelled
mentally deficient

44:57.320 --> 45:01.360
and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist...

45:01.360 --> 45:02.475
Oop.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.039
..unlike most people.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.280
From then on,
Max cooled himself differently

45:09.280 --> 45:11.680
and things went back to normal

45:11.680 --> 45:17.400
until after his 48th birthday,
when his numbers finally came up.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.720
Welcome to the New York Lottery

45:19.720 --> 45:21.840
and these are tonight's
winning numbers -

45:21.840 --> 45:25.000
3, 5,

45:25.000 --> 45:30.720
6, 9,

45:30.720 --> 45:36.431
11 and 12!

46:16.480 --> 46:18.360
Max was sensible
with his sudden wealth

46:18.360 --> 46:21.480
and had bought a lifetime supply
of chocolate

46:21.480 --> 46:24.440
and the complete Noblet collection.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.756
Two of his life goals had come true.

46:31.840 --> 46:34.680
But he still had a lot of money

46:34.680 --> 46:37.040
so decided to give it to Ivy...

46:38.320 --> 46:41.392
..who was also very sensible...

47:13.760 --> 47:17.639
..until her own numbers came up.

47:25.880 --> 47:29.720
Ivy willed everything
to the local cat shelter,

47:29.720 --> 47:34.640
whose owner relocated
her kind donation to his bank account,

47:34.640 --> 47:40.880
his wife's new breasts, a Ferrari
and enough fuel to get to Mexico.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.240
Despite achieving all his life's goals,

47:52.240 --> 47:56.560
Max still felt incomplete.

47:56.560 --> 47:59.960
Mr Ravioli just wasn't
cutting the mustard anymore

47:59.960 --> 48:04.909
and seemed more interested
in his self-help books.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.280
Mary had given Max
a taste of real friendship

48:08.280 --> 48:11.636
and there was just no comparison.

48:12.280 --> 48:14.360
She missed him too

48:14.360 --> 48:17.158
but no longer saved to see him.

48:18.320 --> 48:22.074
She now saved for a different reason.

48:31.600 --> 48:36.993
One day Mr Ravioli got up,
left and never came back.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.160
Max sought Dr Hazelhof's advice.

48:45.560 --> 48:50.440
He told Max that true friendship
is seen through the heart,

48:50.440 --> 48:52.360
not through the eyes,

48:52.360 --> 49:00.040
and that it was time he wrote to Mary
to reveal his true self, warts and all.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.918
Max understood.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.400
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

49:22.400 --> 49:24.868
there is something I have to tell you

49:24.960 --> 49:28.669
which will explain
why I have not written.

49:28.760 --> 49:34.949
Each time I received one of your letters,
I had a severe anxiety attack.

49:35.040 --> 49:39.520
This is because recently,
while I was in a mental institution,

49:39.520 --> 49:46.160
they diagnosed that I have a new thing
called Asperger's syndrome,

49:46.160 --> 49:53.200
which is a neurobiological,
pervasive, developmental disability.

49:53.200 --> 49:56.800
I prefer 'Aspie' for short.

49:56.800 --> 50:00.600
I will now list some of the traits
of an Aspie.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.760
No.1 - I find the world
very confusing and chaotic

50:07.760 --> 50:12.920
because my mind
is very literal and logical.

50:16.040 --> 50:22.195
2 - I have trouble understanding
the expressions on people's faces.

50:22.280 --> 50:30.278
When I was younger, I made a book
to help me when I was confused.

50:33.040 --> 50:36.350
I still have trouble with some people.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.640
Ivy was hard to understand
because of her wrinkles

50:39.640 --> 50:43.076
and because her eyebrows weren't real.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.600
3 - I have bad handwriting,

50:46.600 --> 50:49.520
am hypersensitive...

50:49.520 --> 50:52.160
..clumsy

50:52.160 --> 50:55.516
and can get very concerned.

50:58.920 --> 51:06.395
4 - I like solving problems.
Ivy said this is a good thing.

51:08.880 --> 51:14.000
And finally No.5 -
I have trouble expressing my emotions.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
Dr Bernard Hazelhof says
my brain is defective

51:19.000 --> 51:24.480
but one day there will be a cure
for my disability.

51:24.480 --> 51:26.880
I do not like it when he says this.

51:26.880 --> 51:31.760
I do not feel disabled, defective
or I need to be cured.

51:31.760 --> 51:34.638
I like being an Aspie.

51:34.720 --> 51:38.793
It would be like trying to change
the colour of my eyes.

51:40.560 --> 51:44.520
There is one thing
I wish I could change, however.

51:46.160 --> 51:48.680
I wish I could cry properly.

51:51.080 --> 51:56.240
I squeeze and squeeze
but nothing... comes out.

51:56.240 --> 51:59.600
I cry when I cut onions
but this does not count.

51:59.600 --> 52:02.400
Anyway, do you like the word 'cumquat'?

52:02.400 --> 52:04.440
It is a type of fruit.

52:04.440 --> 52:07.159
Do you have
a favourite-sounding word?

52:07.240 --> 52:11.000
My top 5 are ointment, bumblebee,

52:11.000 --> 52:14.240
Vladivostok, banana

52:14.240 --> 52:16.117
and testicle.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.753
I have also invented some new words -

52:21.840 --> 52:28.951
'confuzzled', which is being confused
and puzzled at the same time,

52:29.040 --> 52:33.636
'snirt', which is a cross between
snow and dirt,

52:33.720 --> 52:36.040
and 'smushables'...

52:36.040 --> 52:41.520
..which are squashed groceries
you find at the bottom of the bag.

52:41.520 --> 52:45.360
I have sent a letter
to the Oxford Dictionary people

52:45.360 --> 52:48.640
asking them to include my words

52:48.640 --> 52:51.837
but I have not heard back.

52:51.920 --> 52:56.160
It is now time for me to go
to my Overeaters Anonymous meeting.

52:56.160 --> 52:59.640
There is a woman there
called Marjorie Buttersworth

52:59.640 --> 53:01.949
who confuzzles me.

53:02.040 --> 53:05.920
She kisses me without my permission

53:05.920 --> 53:12.519
so tonight I have decided to rub onions
under my armpits to repel her.

53:12.640 --> 53:17.430
Your friend in America,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.120
PS. Please find enclosed

53:24.120 --> 53:27.874
some chocolate-covered ants
I found at the deli.

53:29.080 --> 53:33.080
PPS. Not much has happened
since I last wrote

53:33.080 --> 53:39.428
except for my manslaughter charges,
lotto win and Ivy's death.

53:42.680 --> 53:45.960
Mary was thrilled
Max had finally written

53:45.960 --> 53:48.680
and suddenly had a fabulous idea.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.557
A-ha!

54:22.960 --> 54:26.760
Mary and Max's friendship
was resuscitated

54:26.760 --> 54:31.800
and her tears were the best gift
he'd ever received.

54:31.800 --> 54:35.952
Inside Max's head
his brain was smiling.

54:37.480 --> 54:40.000
Loaded up with bizarre forms
of chocolate,

54:40.000 --> 54:44.360
their letters flew thick and fast
between the continents.

54:44.360 --> 54:47.640
Max learnt to read Mary's letters
with caution

54:47.640 --> 54:51.553
and at the slightest tingle of tension,
he would stop,

54:51.640 --> 54:55.269
take his medication
and soothe his nerves.

54:55.360 --> 55:01.120
Each letter he would iron, laminate
and file in a special place,

55:01.120 --> 55:04.157
which also soothed his nerves.

55:08.360 --> 55:12.751
He enjoyed answering her questions
and solving her puzzles like -

55:12.840 --> 55:15.600
Do sheep shrink when it rains?

55:15.600 --> 55:19.520
Why do old men
wear their pants so high?

55:19.520 --> 55:24.680
Do gooses get goosebumps
and why is bellybutton lint blue?

55:24.680 --> 55:26.320
Are there Noblets in heaven?

55:26.320 --> 55:30.920
And if a taxi goes backwards,
does the driver owe you money?

55:30.920 --> 55:36.680
In turn, Mary simply enjoyed
hearing about Max's fascinating life -

55:36.680 --> 55:39.035
how many people
he'd counted littering...

55:44.320 --> 55:46.560
..how the latest Henry had died...

55:55.720 --> 55:58.871
..and new recipes he'd invented
for chicken.

56:02.320 --> 56:04.320
Each nourished the other

56:04.320 --> 56:07.120
and, as Mary grew taller,

56:07.120 --> 56:09.080
Max grew wider -

56:09.080 --> 56:14.632
their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on Mary's Noblets.

56:18.760 --> 56:21.600
Although Max found solace in Mary,

56:21.600 --> 56:24.840
he still found the rest of the world
bewildering.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.600
And he couldn't understand

56:26.600 --> 56:29.560
why he was seen as the odd one

56:29.560 --> 56:32.438
while everyone else
was considered normal.

56:34.240 --> 56:37.720
Humans were endlessly illogical.

56:37.720 --> 56:42.880
Why did they throw out food when
there were children starving in lndia?

56:42.880 --> 56:47.520
Why did they clear the rainforests
when they needed the oxygen?

56:47.520 --> 56:54.120
And why did they create bus timetables
when they never ran on time?

56:54.120 --> 57:00.640
He agreed with his favourite physicist
that there are only two things infinite -

57:00.640 --> 57:04.520
the universe and man's stupidity.

57:06.080 --> 57:11.720
And for Mary, even though
Max filled her with confidence...

57:11.720 --> 57:12.680
Bullseye!

57:12.680 --> 57:16.160
..her world was far from perfect.

57:16.160 --> 57:19.550
The grip of love had her by the throat.

57:39.360 --> 57:44.720
At 4.59 pm, on the 8th of the 8th 1988...

57:46.640 --> 57:51.200
..Noel Norman Dinkle
attached his last string

57:51.200 --> 57:57.320
and, after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags, he retired.

57:57.320 --> 58:02.240
To celebrate, Noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy

58:02.240 --> 58:05.960
and taking up metal detecting instead.

58:05.960 --> 58:09.509
But, sadly, it was not a hobby
he had for long.

58:45.360 --> 58:48.720
In his will, Noel had left Mary
some money

58:48.720 --> 58:53.555
so she decided to go to university
and study disorders of the mind,

58:53.640 --> 58:57.440
yearning to learn more about her friend.

58:57.440 --> 59:03.320
Mary was as popular at university
as she was at school.

59:03.320 --> 59:06.680
Damian went there too,
aching to be a Thespian.

59:06.680 --> 59:09.560
Hi there, M-M-Mary.

59:09.560 --> 59:13.109
Hi... hello!

59:22.080 --> 59:24.800
That was damn f-f-funny!

59:54.480 --> 01:00:00.120
Hey, Damian,
your mum's roses look fab!

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.600
Oh, th-thanks, Mary.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.040
Um, M-Mary,
can I tell you something?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:06.880
Sure, babe!

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.874
Um, um, you've got d-d-d-d-dog's poo
on your shoe.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.480
Dear Max,

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:27.400
I have been such an idiot.

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.840
I've wasted all my money
on something pointless

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.717
when I should have been saving
to see you.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.680
I know love upsets you
so I won't go on about it.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.000
All I want to say is that love
is obviously not for me.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.280
I hope you are well and enjoy
the chocolate cigarettes I've enclosed.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.599
Love Mary.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.360
Oh, you should be ashamed!

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.590
- Come on, baby. Let's go.
- Oh, Mum...

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.752
I told you never to talk to strangers.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:22.440
Noel's sudden death
had filled Vera with remorse and guilt

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.831
and she coped
in the only way she knew.

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:00.440
Dear Max,

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.920
our wedding day was everything
I have ever dreamt,

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.840
making up for the terrible year I've had.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.720
Although all the guests
were Damian's family and friends,

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.711
I felt very welcome.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.840
Damian is so perfect.
He even made my wedding dress.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.120
And for our honeymoon

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.476
he took me to Mykonos -
his favourite island in Greece.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.240
I got to ride a donkey

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.760
and found the perfect gift for Len.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.720
Poor Len, he's still struggling
with his agoraphobia.

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.440
Aaaaahhhh!

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.160
Damian and I are so similar.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.199
He even has his own penfriend, who lives
on a sheep farm in New Zealand.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.800
Mary... M-M-M-Mary.

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.598
Mary... M-M-M-Mary.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.272
Ohhh.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.552
Mary was bursting with self-esteem

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.520
and her confidence
was almost unbearable.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.040
At university, she shone

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.194
and took it upon herself
to cure the world of mental illness.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.760
She did her thesis
on Asperger's syndrome

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:31.639
and used Max as her case study.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.320
Her professors
were thoroughly impressed

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:38.040
and her writing praised far and wide.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.560
Soon, publishers queued
to print her unique insight

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:48.880
and by her 25th birthday, thousands
of copies were ready to be shipped.

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:50.640
Dear Max,

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.200
I am very proud to give you

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.600
the very first copy of my book
about your disability

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.832
and the hopes that we have
to one day cure it.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:01.760
Even more exciting

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:07.278
is that I am finally coming to meet and
celebrate with you in one week's time.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.480
I'm also going to give you
half the royalties.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.800
Your loving friend, Mary.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:18.157
PS. Please find enclosed
some chocolate-coated Swiss almonds.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.240
Max didn't take the news very well -

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:30.120
not very well at all.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.880
Dear Mary Daisy Dinkle,

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.040
I cannot express myself
very clearly at this moment

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:44.200
and so I will list my emotions
in the order they feel most intense -

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:51.520
hurt, confuzzledness, betrayal,
discomfort, distress and wheeziness.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.680
This last one is not really an emotion

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.240
but I thought you should know about it
anyway.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.629
With her suitcase packed for New York,
Mary said goodbye to Damian.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:40.120
She hadn't been this excited since
she'd found a Noblet in the gutter.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.360
But her excitement
suddenly dribbled away

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.794
Iike a chocolate in the sun.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:00.111
Mary slowly sank
into a puddle of depression, self-loathing

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.440
and cooking sherry.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:07.880
The only colour left in her life
was her beloved Damian,

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.640
only an arm's length away
but as distant as the moon.

01:08:18.439 --> 01:08:23.720
She lost interest in the world
and it lost interest in her

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.600
as a horrible apparition began to haunt.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:32.760
She started to spend her nights
making pompoms

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:36.069
and eating two-minute noodles.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:39.790
Each day, with strength and shame,

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.920
Mary trudged to the letterbox in hope,

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.960
only to swivel, shrivel
and slink back inside.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.760
My dearest Mary,

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.957
by the time you read this,
I will be on a plane to New Zealand

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.235
to begin a new life.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.240
You probably haven 't even noticed
I'd packed my bags.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.680
I have fallen in love
with my penfriend, Desmond,

01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:59.200
and I'm going to live
on his sheep farm.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:05.080
It's been hard to watch you become
a remnant of the person I once loved.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.880
Your research into m-m-mental illness
has been a dmirable

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:13.040
but your i-idealistic pursuit to remedy it
has been misguided.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.077
Mary, you have to realise y-you are not
a magic beauty cream

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.440
you can smooth on the world
to rid it of its wrinkles.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.240
I love you, Mary,

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.400
but I love Desmond more.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.640
I hope one day your heart will heal
and we can be friends.

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.632
Yours compassionately,
Damian.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.360
Aaaarghh!

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.480
Dear Mayor Ridiculani,

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:06.400
on Monday I counted 27 people
illegally dropping cigarette butts.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.960
I would like to recommend
the fine be increased

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.000
to a minimum of $1 million
as a stronger deterrent

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.197
and would be happy...

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.555
Thank you.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.876
Sorry.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.200
Dear Mary,

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.480
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.597
as a sign that I forgive you.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:09.150
When I received your book,
the emotions inside...

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.280
On the way home,
Max sat to count the stars.

01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.800
He felt complete -

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:13.837
the world was back in balance.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:37.560
<i># When I was just a little girl</i>

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.271
<i># I asked my mother, what will I be?</i>

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:50.520
<i># Will I be pretty, will I be rich?</i>

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.720
<i># Here's what she said to me...</i>

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:00.440
<i># Que sera sera</i>

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.880
<i># Whatever will be will be</i>

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:10.800
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:15.316
<i># Que sera sera</i>

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.920
<i># Que sera sera</i>

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:50.640
<i># Whatever will be will be</i>

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.680
<i># The future's not ours to see</i>

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:59.992
<i># Que sera sera</i>

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.238
<i># What will be will be</i>

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.914
<i># Que sera sera</i>

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.673
Ah!

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.673
Len had saved the day
and after 45 years

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.356
he finally conquered his agoraphobia.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.680
Moron!

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.680
Dear Mary,

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.280
please find enclosed
my entire Noblet collection

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.200
as a sign that I forgive you.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.960
When I received your book,
the emotions inside my brain

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.829
felt like they were in a tumble dryer,
smashing into each other.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.280
The hurt felt like when I accidentally
stapled my lips together.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:22.872
Ow!

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.320
The reason I forgive you
is because you are not perfect.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:32.160
You are imperfect, and so am l.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.040
All humans are imperfect,

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.192
even the man outside my apartment
who litters.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.435
When I was young,
I wanted to be anybody but myself.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:49.320
Dr Bernard Hazelhof said
if I was on a desert island

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.920
then I would have to get used
to my own company -

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.992
just me and the coconuts.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:20:02.355
He said I would have to accept myself,
my warts and all,

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:05.280
and that we don't get to choose
our warts.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.750
They are a part of us
and we have to live with them.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.560
We can, however, choose our friends

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:19.680
and I am glad I have chosen you.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.672
Dr Bernard Hazelhof also said

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:27.080
that everyone's lives
are like a very long sidewalk.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.600
Some are well paved.
Others, like mine,

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.960
have cracks, banana skins
and cigarette butts.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:43.638
Your sidewalk is like mine
but probably not as many cracks.

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:47.508
Hopefully, one day
our sidewalks will meet

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:51.070
and we can share
a can of condensed milk.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:21:00.756
You are my best friend.
You are my only friend.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.960
Your American penpal,
Max Jerry Horowitz.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.040
PS. I have recently found the perfect job
with a survey company.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.591
All I have to do is eat things
and tick boxes.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:36.997
Max?

01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:42.751
Max?

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.959
Max?

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.557
Hello?

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:58.429
Max, it's us!

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:00.636
We're here!

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.439
Oh, Max?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:16.160
Max had died peacefully that morning

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.119
after finishing his final can
of condensed milk.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:34.512
You are my best friend.
You are my only friend.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:45.200
He smelt like liquorice
and old books, she thought to herself,

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:48.720
as tears rolled from her eyes

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.474
the colour of muddy puddles.
