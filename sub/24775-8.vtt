00:47.520 --> 00:49.640
<i>- There's something in the rain.
- Mom!</i>

00:51.680 --> 00:52.680
<i>A virus.</i>

00:54.040 --> 00:56.840
<i>Rasmus is the key to it all.</i>

00:58.960 --> 01:00.560
<i>No harm must come to him.</i>

01:03.000 --> 01:05.319
You're responsible
for your little brother.

01:07.840 --> 01:09.400
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
<i>I promise.</i>

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
There it is.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.320
We're approaching.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.120
<i>Good. Bring the subject to us.</i>

01:45.720 --> 01:46.720
Understood.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.760
The left side has been treated.
The trunk too.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.280
Moving on to the hood.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.800
The vehicle is clear.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.160
This way.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.480
You two, that way.
And you go to the bunker.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.120
- Not another bunker.
- No way.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.400
- You have to be kidding.
- There's nothing shifty about it.

02:54.480 --> 02:55.760
You're not prisoners.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.080
If Rasmus carries antibodies
for a vaccine, you can all get out.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.600
You just have to wait, okay?

03:01.320 --> 03:03.920
Simone, there's someone
waiting for you and Rasmus.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.160
Okay.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.760
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
Come.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.640
Simone.

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
Rasmus.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.519
Don't.

04:21.079 --> 04:22.079
Don't.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
It's okay.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.440
It's okay, my darling.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.160
Okay?

04:52.440 --> 04:56.560
- These two need to be checked.
- Yes, in Room 13. I've made preparations.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
Just come when...

04:59.240 --> 05:02.680
- Rasmus! Rasmus?
- Put the patient in isolation.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.080
Check for infection, CRP and leukocytes.

05:05.160 --> 05:08.080
- We'll cultivate his blood.
- What are they doing to him?

05:08.160 --> 05:11.160
- Don't worry. Nothing will happen to him.
- What's going on, Dad?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.800
- Help him. Help Rasmus!
- Come with us.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.840
Go up the stairs, to the left.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.880
Third door on your right,
there's a room. Wait there.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
Stay down.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.200
I'm sick of bunkers.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.320
We're getting out soon.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.640
Out to what?

05:55.040 --> 05:56.760
We have to hope for the best.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.240
You heard him. We're not prisoners.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.800
Right. Where's our rifle?

06:03.560 --> 06:06.880
- So we're not exactly guests either.
- No, we're not.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.800
- Rasmus, you have to take a shower.
- Why?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.960
You're dirty. Come on.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.720
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.320
I don't think so.

06:33.880 --> 06:34.880
Rasmus.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.240
Rasmus.

06:37.920 --> 06:41.080
- You have to take a shower.
- You're not the boss.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.080
- Yes, I am.
- You're not my mother.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.320
- No, I'm not.
- Then don't pretend to be.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.480
- You're not the boss.
- Rasmus, stop it!

06:48.560 --> 06:50.920
I don't want to hear anything about Mom!

06:51.000 --> 06:52.640
She's fucking dead!

06:55.120 --> 06:59.360
I didn't choose to be the grown-up,
but that's just how it is now, okay?

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Sweetie?

07:10.240 --> 07:11.960
Why did you have to say that?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.240
Where is he?

07:45.560 --> 07:47.560
- He's fine.
- Where is he?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.800
Has he been taking a lot of morphine?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.720
You did everything you could
to look after him.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.680
This isn't your fault.

08:01.760 --> 08:03.200
You don't know that.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.760
Simone...

08:04.840 --> 08:07.120
Don't think you know anything
about how it's been.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.200
Whether I did good or bad. You don't know.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.640
- You don't.
- No.

08:14.240 --> 08:15.680
Where the hell were you?

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
Where were you?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.560
Why didn't you come for us?

08:21.560 --> 08:23.520
Well? We waited for six years!

08:28.320 --> 08:29.520
What?

08:30.200 --> 08:31.200
Come here.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.240
- Jean?!
- Lea?!

09:19.400 --> 09:20.640
Hi there.

09:25.680 --> 09:28.760
- I thought you were dead.
- I've just taken a shower.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.080
Jean.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.200
And then what?

09:45.320 --> 09:48.240
I thought they were going to kill me,
but they didn't.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
They didn't?

09:49.400 --> 09:51.200
If they had, I wouldn't be here.

09:51.840 --> 09:55.200
They said they'd found what they were
looking for. And then you showed up.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.360
Amazing.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
I'm sorry.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.160
It's okay.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.120
I understood.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.000
You left Jean behind?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.080
Yeah.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.440
Patrick tried to save us. It was my fault.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.240
By leaving Jean behind?

10:14.800 --> 10:17.400
- We just apologized...
- That's not good enough.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.200
It's good enough for me. It's okay.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.400
We're sorry. Okay? Sorry.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.600
Hey, it's okay.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.240
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:32.320 --> 10:33.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.080
- What's that?
- Nutritional supplements.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.760
- Nutritional supplements?
- Yes.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.320
Your nutrition hasn't exactly been great
these past six years.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.200
We scanned you when you arrived.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.200
- Are there drugs in this?
- Afraid not.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.160
I took it when I got here.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.040
- Know what's in it?
- No. They're nutritional supplements.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.920
- And you just swallowed it?
- Sure.

11:01.000 --> 11:01.840
Shouldn't I have?

11:01.920 --> 11:04.160
Take one. Then we'll take one, too.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.360
- I already did.
- I couldn't care less.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.160
If we take one, you take one.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.160
Just kidding. I'm sorry.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.360
What the hell is going on?

11:34.920 --> 11:37.400
- She did the same thing to me.
- That was tacky.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.320
Cheers.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.600
He's sleeping at the moment.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.160
What are they doing to him?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.040
Making sure he's doing okay.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.320
Is Rasmus immune?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.840
He was the first to get it
in its purest form.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.120
So Rasmus carries the virus?

12:10.440 --> 12:11.880
Yes, it's a part of him.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.320
But it doesn't affect him the same way
it affects everyone else.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.840
The version of the cure that Rasmus got...

12:19.640 --> 12:20.640
it's working.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.120
What does that mean?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.640
That Rasmus is carrying the cure.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.600
Did he always carry it?

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
Yes.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.880
Then why didn't you come get us?

12:37.640 --> 12:38.640
Not now.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.320
- Can you make the virus go away?
- It's complicated.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.280
I want to see him.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.160
You must trust me.
This is all I can tell you right now.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.040
I had to protect you back then,
and I have to protect you now.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.520
Trust me.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.880
- What are you doing?
- They were all dead.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
What?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.880
Are you shutting the bunker down?

14:13.960 --> 14:14.960
Yes.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.400
We don't need it anymore.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.960
Rasmus?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.040
Rasmus?

14:33.560 --> 14:34.600
That looks good.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.160
You're in the operation ward.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.240
Everything looks fine. I just need one
more thing. A quick swab of your mouth.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.360
The swab, please.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.960
Where's my dad?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.720
He's on his way.

14:49.560 --> 14:52.600
Now, open up, then I'll be done.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.920
Rasmus, open your mouth.
It's a very simple procedure.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.200
Well, I'll need to be effective, right?

15:01.720 --> 15:03.520
If you don't want to cooperate, then...

15:03.600 --> 15:05.160
Then... then...

15:05.520 --> 15:06.760
I need help here!

15:08.720 --> 15:10.600
Please. Where's my dad?

15:16.280 --> 15:17.320
Where's Dad?

15:18.120 --> 15:19.160
Let me go!

15:22.560 --> 15:24.360
Let me go! Dad!

15:25.120 --> 15:26.840
Let me go!

15:29.680 --> 15:30.520
Dad!

15:30.600 --> 15:32.800
<i>Dad! Help!</i>

15:35.880 --> 15:37.560
<i>Are there other subjects?</i>

15:38.600 --> 15:41.960
<i>Yes, a girl. Eight years old.</i>

15:42.720 --> 15:44.520
<i>Are there any more shots left?</i>

15:44.840 --> 15:46.520
<i>- Yeah, but...
- Proceed.</i>

16:13.920 --> 16:15.800
<i>- Hi.
- What the hell?</i>

16:16.480 --> 16:17.720
Why are you still up?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.800
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

16:21.960 --> 16:23.080
Is something wrong?

16:25.520 --> 16:26.520
I saw my dad.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.720
What was he like?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.720
<i>I just can't forget that he caused
the deaths of so many people.</i>

16:37.360 --> 16:38.360
<i>No.</i>

16:40.640 --> 16:41.640
I can't...

16:44.680 --> 16:46.560
What if coming here was a mistake?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
<i>Simone, it was a joint decision.</i>

16:50.400 --> 16:52.160
- No, I was the one...
<i>- Yes, it was.</i>

16:54.520 --> 16:56.640
<i>And if everything else fails...</i>

16:59.280 --> 17:00.920
at least I got to meet you.

17:05.210 --> 17:06.650
<i>It was the right thing to do.</i>

17:08.560 --> 17:10.800
<i>- What was...?
- Martin, I've got to go.</i>

17:12.560 --> 17:13.640
Come with me.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.920
- You should never have come here.
- What?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.359
Listen to me now. This is important.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.560
You have to get out of here.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.400
- Why are you...?
- Rasmus...

17:33.400 --> 17:35.840
he shouldn't be here.
It's dangerous for him.

17:35.920 --> 17:40.120
- But you said he was...
- The virus isn't so easy to get at.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.000
It's in his brain.

17:42.680 --> 17:43.840
In his bone marrow.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.800
- If a vaccine is to come of it...
- They'll kill him.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.200
You can't be serious.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.520
That's why I didn't come for you.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.560
I've been searching for six years
for someone who could take his place.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.720
To protect him, to...

18:04.240 --> 18:06.040
prevent him from getting hurt.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.200
You killed all those people.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.320
Didn't you?

18:15.800 --> 18:16.800
Dad?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.560
You killed all those people.

18:28.680 --> 18:29.800
You're my children.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.360
I love you.

18:36.280 --> 18:40.600
That's why I had to do it,
and that's why we have to leave. Okay?

18:47.880 --> 18:48.880
What do we do?

18:49.960 --> 18:52.560
We meet where we met the first time.

18:53.720 --> 18:55.040
Keep an eye on the guards.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.400
I'll go get Rasmus.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.640
We'll meet here as fast as we can.

19:08.760 --> 19:12.800
How come you don't give up? You've lost
your wife, you've lost your children.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.080
Why aren't you mourning?

19:18.400 --> 19:19.520
It has no function.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.760
Where's your son?

19:31.680 --> 19:32.880
I already told you.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.320
They didn't reach safety. They died.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.880
Yes, but how did he die?
He couldn't have been infected.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.680
He was already carrying the virus.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.480
It was a beta version.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.040
It was practically identical
to the one we released.

19:52.280 --> 19:53.920
I'm not sure what you're getting at.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.360
What did you find in the bunker?

19:59.440 --> 20:00.360
Bjørn, I...

20:00.440 --> 20:01.560
Who was down there?

20:03.640 --> 20:04.800
Is he down there?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.320
He's the one we're looking for.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.640
It would kill him.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.080
We have to go get him.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.000
I'll take it from here.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.840
Prepare him for surgery.

21:08.760 --> 21:09.840
I'm relieving you.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.680
What happened here?

21:27.560 --> 21:28.760
What was she doing?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.760
She was trying to take a swab.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.280
Open your mouth, Rasmus.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.720
Go on.

21:54.600 --> 21:55.680
Dad...

22:00.480 --> 22:02.680
I don't understand what's happening.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.440
Dad...

22:11.120 --> 22:13.440
No, it can't be.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.640
Please help me.

22:31.080 --> 22:32.400
I'm not sure I can.

22:35.960 --> 22:36.960
I'm so sorry.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.840
<i>Frederik?</i>

22:46.160 --> 22:47.160
Wait here.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.920
No, don't go, Dad.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.040
Dad?!

22:51.920 --> 22:54.760
Sten, the virus has spread
to headquarters.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.560
We need to initiate a lockdown.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.480
What's going on?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.320
Come, come, come! We have to get out!

23:22.400 --> 23:25.200
- We must find Rasmus and Simone.
- Is it locked?

23:28.920 --> 23:30.720
- Find something! Come on!
- Go!

23:33.840 --> 23:36.680
- Jean, get me something, damn it!
- Coming!

23:47.840 --> 23:50.000
There must be something we can use!

23:50.080 --> 23:51.400
Martin, move!

23:51.680 --> 23:53.280
- Martin!
- Get out of my way!

23:53.520 --> 23:55.600
Yes, try this!

23:55.680 --> 23:56.720
Come on!

23:57.360 --> 24:00.440
I'm on my way. We have to talk via video.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.520
This can't get out.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.840
<i>How does it look?
Can we start making the vaccine?</i>

24:18.320 --> 24:21.320
- He...
<i>- Frederik, this is an easy question.</i>

24:22.520 --> 24:23.520
It's my son.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.880
<i>It would seem we have a lot to talk about.</i>

24:35.240 --> 24:37.320
- I can explain.
<i>- But we won't.</i>

24:38.040 --> 24:39.600
<i>Can we start making the vaccine?</i>

24:39.680 --> 24:40.680
He's contagious.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.400
<i>He's contagious?</i>

24:42.960 --> 24:45.520
He infects others
without getting sick himself.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.200
The virus has mutated.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.080
<i>Frederik, if the virus has mutated,</i>

24:49.160 --> 24:52.160
<i>- he could kill us all.
- He'll kill everybody, I know.</i>

24:52.240 --> 24:53.160
<i>Where is he now?</i>

24:53.240 --> 24:54.560
In quarantine.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.640
<i>Keep him there. I'll send in a team.</i>

24:58.240 --> 24:59.240
<i>Keep him alive.</i>

24:59.760 --> 25:01.640
<i>We need to start operating and run tests.</i>

25:01.720 --> 25:02.880
But we can't do that.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.480
<i>Yes, we can and we must.</i>

25:04.960 --> 25:07.200
<i>I understand that you want
to protect your son,</i>

25:07.280 --> 25:10.480
<i>but you do understand that if
he is contagious, it's the only option?</i>

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Yes.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.440
<i>It's bigger than us now.</i>

25:23.760 --> 25:25.000
Is Rasmus contagious?

25:27.760 --> 25:28.760
Is he?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.080
Yes.

25:31.160 --> 25:34.120
But you have to do something.
You have to save him.

25:34.880 --> 25:37.600
- I can't. Simone...
- You have to do something.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.720
Simone...

25:38.800 --> 25:42.200
But it was you.
Rasmus, the rain, all of it.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.280
It was you!

25:43.880 --> 25:45.360
Dad, you have to do something.

25:45.440 --> 25:49.120
We don't know what the mutation will do.
We don't know how the virus will evolve.

25:49.200 --> 25:53.520
We can't go on the run with him.
He might kill us all. We can't risk it.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.400
- You said there might be a way, right?
- There's no time.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.520
There simply isn't time.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.040
What if we had time?

26:00.120 --> 26:01.880
I can't save him.

26:02.680 --> 26:03.680
Okay?

26:04.480 --> 26:06.160
If you won't do it, I will.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.360
Wait, it's too dangerous.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.520
He's going to kill us all. Simone!

26:19.760 --> 26:20.800
<i>Martin!</i>

26:20.880 --> 26:22.160
- Simone.
- What's going on?

26:22.240 --> 26:24.640
<i>- You need to get out.
- We can't, we're locked inside.</i>

26:24.720 --> 26:27.920
<i>You need to block the air vents.</i>

26:28.000 --> 26:29.400
Yeah, yeah. Come.

26:29.480 --> 26:30.360
- Patrick.
- Yeah?

26:30.440 --> 26:31.560
- Jean, come!
- Yeah.

26:32.680 --> 26:34.680
- Find some blankets and soak them.
- Okay.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.840
Find something we can burn!

26:37.120 --> 26:38.960
Martin! Why?

26:39.040 --> 26:41.680
When the oxygen level drops,
the doors will open.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.120
- Come on now!
- Okay.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.160
I have cardboard boxes!

26:45.720 --> 26:47.160
Great! Come, come, come!

26:47.240 --> 26:48.400
Rasmus?

26:49.880 --> 26:50.880
Rasmus?

27:11.960 --> 27:12.960
Stop!

27:23.480 --> 27:24.880
What's going on?

27:26.200 --> 27:28.360
- I don't understand.
- Rasmus.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.720
Rasmus.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.520
Where's Dad?

27:38.160 --> 27:39.160
Forget about him.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.400
Are you ready?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.120
Come on, Lea!

27:46.240 --> 27:47.240
Okay.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.960
- Ready?
- Yes.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.000
Do you know what you're doing?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.480
No.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.560
- Not even remotely.
- Awesome.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.120
- Get out. Get out! Go!
- Boys!

28:08.440 --> 28:09.440
Run!

28:09.640 --> 28:11.840
Martin, I really hope this works!

28:12.240 --> 28:13.960
Wrap blankets around your heads.

28:24.320 --> 28:25.320
We need to get away.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.000
What about the cure and all that...?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.920
None of it is true. It's all a lie.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.000
Why did you take a step back?

28:37.400 --> 28:38.400
Rasmus...

28:42.480 --> 28:43.760
Am I contagious?

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
Listen.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.920
We just have to get inside
and get you into a suit.

28:48.240 --> 28:51.040
- I want it out of my body.
- Yes, I'll make sure that happens.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.720
You just need a suit right now.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
Rasmus...

28:59.560 --> 29:03.440
Easy, easy, easy!
The doors will open in a second!

29:03.520 --> 29:04.520
Come on!

29:27.680 --> 29:28.680
Martin!

29:29.560 --> 29:31.160
Martin! Lea!

29:37.160 --> 29:39.400
- Jean?
- Yes, I'm not dead.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.800
- Jean, come, let's find a car.
- Patrick?!

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
Patrick!

29:52.280 --> 29:55.080
- Simone, no.
- Dad...

29:56.560 --> 29:57.680
Don't do this.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.320
Don't do this.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.200
If you take him with you, you'll die.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.000
Dad?

30:06.280 --> 30:09.360
- We'll all die.
- You're lying.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.800
Listen... just let us go.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.160
- Okay?
- Yeah.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.480
Rasmus.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.280
Dad.

30:30.840 --> 30:33.360
- I can't let you leave.
- Don't shoot.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.360
- I'm sorry.
- Dad!

30:35.440 --> 30:36.560
What are you doing?

30:38.680 --> 30:39.960
You can't do this.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.760
You don't know what I can do.

30:43.640 --> 30:44.640
Dad.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.480
You don't know what I've done.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.840
Yes, we do.

30:50.320 --> 30:56.080
You have no idea what I have sacrificed.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.920
We were going to save the world.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.080
- Well...
- Martin.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.840
- You did a very good job then.
- Martin!

31:02.920 --> 31:04.040
Now let us go.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.200
Okay? Lower your gun and let us pass.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.640
- No.
- I don't understand.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
I don't understand.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.240
- I'm sorry.
- Dad...

31:23.680 --> 31:25.000
I can't let you out.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.440
I'm sorry.

31:33.360 --> 31:34.360
Get up!

31:34.640 --> 31:35.800
Rasmus, run!

31:40.760 --> 31:42.080
Come on. What happened?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.800
Rasmus! No!

31:57.880 --> 32:01.280
- We have to get to the other side.
- Sure, let's smash through the wall.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.920
The Strangers got through.
There's got to be a gate.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.680
Yeah, there probably is.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.800
- Patrick!
- This is so fucked up!

32:18.880 --> 32:20.320
Just go, damn it!

32:21.400 --> 32:22.400
There it is.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.440
You're not getting through.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.640
If you don't move, we'll run you over.

32:48.920 --> 32:49.920
We'll kill you.

32:51.560 --> 32:53.720
You can't. Not while we have Rasmus.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.160
Get out of the car.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.920
Don't go out there.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.280
Simone.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.360
Simone.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.680
- I want to see my family.
- And I want to save my brother.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.040
Did you know they were gonna kill him?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.880
- They say he's dangerous.
- Dangerous? The boy?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.480
Just let us through.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.160
Does it itch?

33:29.600 --> 33:30.600
Your neck?

33:32.360 --> 33:33.560
Well, does it?

33:34.360 --> 33:35.360
- Yes.
- Yes?

33:37.520 --> 33:39.200
Then you've taken the pill.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.760
What pill? What are you talking about?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.400
None of us is getting out of here.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.480
Your father made sure of that.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.880
What the hell are you talking about?

33:53.560 --> 33:56.560
Thousands of tiny capsules are moving
around our bodies right now.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.520
The rash on your neck
is an allergic reaction.

34:04.640 --> 34:07.640
It'll pass...
but the capsules will still be there.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.080
If we leave the zone...

34:10.920 --> 34:12.080
they're triggered.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.199
I think you can imagine what that means.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
Fuck!

34:17.520 --> 34:18.800
What is he talking about?

34:18.880 --> 34:21.040
So they lied about
the nutritional supplements.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.000
What?

34:23.080 --> 34:24.080
Simone...

34:25.440 --> 34:26.719
did you get a pill?

34:26.800 --> 34:29.000
Did someone give you a pill?
Then you can leave.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.760
You're the only one who can.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.360
- No, you should...
- Don't move!

34:33.440 --> 34:34.600
Yes, you have to.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.840
Look, get out. You shouldn't be here.

34:42.199 --> 34:43.040
Okay?

34:43.120 --> 34:46.360
Get in the car and leave.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.480
- You can do it.
- What about you?

34:49.560 --> 34:50.560
I'm staying.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.800
It's not that bad.

34:58.680 --> 34:59.680
Hey.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
No. You're coming with me, Martin.

35:06.280 --> 35:07.280
No.

35:23.800 --> 35:24.800
Go on.

35:29.120 --> 35:33.680
- You can do it. Simone, you can do it.
- Come on. Go.

35:36.160 --> 35:39.680
You can do this. You can do it. Go.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.480
You can do it, Simone!

35:49.280 --> 35:50.280
Go.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.520
Simone, go!

36:00.640 --> 36:01.640
Go!

36:02.000 --> 36:03.000
Go!

36:04.120 --> 36:05.560
- Go!
- What's going on?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.920
We can't.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.920
Simone.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.280
Simone, go!

36:14.480 --> 36:18.240
- No, I can't.
- Go! You have to go. Go!

36:18.320 --> 36:21.160
- We're a group, we stick together.
- You have to!

36:21.880 --> 36:23.400
I'm not leaving without you.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.720
I'm not leaving without you. Jean, get in.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.480
Patrick!

36:43.960 --> 36:45.840
Back away from the car!

36:50.400 --> 36:51.560
Stand down!

36:56.760 --> 36:58.320
We'll be coming after you.

37:00.160 --> 37:03.240
- Fuckface, man!
- Fuck you, man!

37:27.880 --> 37:29.680
So now what?

37:30.400 --> 37:31.520
Yes, now what?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.360
We'll figure it out.

37:34.440 --> 37:37.280
- Yes, let's go.
- Yes.

38:07.040 --> 38:08.040
Yes?

38:08.320 --> 38:11.000
<i>The subject is gone.
They're inside the zone.</i>

38:11.840 --> 38:12.840
And Frederik?

38:13.640 --> 38:14.640
<i>He's here.</i>

38:15.640 --> 38:16.880
Detain him.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.480
He cannot be trusted.

38:19.640 --> 38:22.640
How does it look for future mutations?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.480
<i>It could go anywhere.</i>

38:25.840 --> 38:27.560
Let's see which are possible.
