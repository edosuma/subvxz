Happy Mother's Day, Ma.
Oh, you look beautiful.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.233
Yeah, yeah.
Talk is cheap.

01:00.300 --> 01:01.967
So is that buffet
you're taking me to,

01:02.033 --> 01:05.700
so let's go before
all the shrimp's gone.

01:06.834 --> 01:10.166
We can't. Charlie Jr. hasn't called
to say happy Mother's Day.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.867
And Michael hasn't called me.

01:11.934 --> 01:14.867
Janet hasn't called me,
although she usually doesn't.

01:14.934 --> 01:18.633
All my children called me,
except Phil.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.233
But he's thinking of me.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.900
He's just short of cash.

01:21.967 --> 01:24.333
(rings)

01:25.533 --> 01:26.300
Hello.

01:28.033 --> 01:31.300
Person-to-person from the Duke
of Windsor to queen Elizabeth?

01:31.367 --> 01:33.100
Oh, that's for me.
That's my Phil.

01:35.367 --> 01:37.600
Hello.
The queen's not here.

01:37.667 --> 01:38.967
She went shopping.

01:39.033 --> 01:40.166
Thanks for calling, Phil.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.600
Send my love to the... damn.

01:44.633 --> 01:46.667
Every year they catch on
quicker and quicker.

01:49.667 --> 01:51.533
I love Phil's calls on Mother's Day.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.333
It's the one time
he doesn't ask for money.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.900
I remember one Mother's Day
I asked for money.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.900
Stan's business
wasn't doing well,

01:59.967 --> 02:04.700
and we had to
ask his mother for a loan.

02:04.767 --> 02:09.533
(retro music playing)

02:18.100 --> 02:21.700
(knocking)

02:21.767 --> 02:23.100
(woman) Go away.

02:23.166 --> 02:25.266
Mama, it's me, Stanley.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.200
-Oh, Stanley.
-Ma.

02:27.266 --> 02:31.033
My pride and joy.
Sunshine of my life.

02:31.100 --> 02:32.900
Hello, mother Zbornak.

02:32.967 --> 02:35.166
Yeah, right.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.433
Here, Mama,
this is for you.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.533
-Happy Mother's Day.
-Oh, thank you, Stanley.

02:43.934 --> 02:46.166
The artwork of Adolph Hitler.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.066
The minute we saw it
we knew it was for you.

02:51.066 --> 02:52.834
Thank you so much, Stanley.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.433
I'm going to put it right here
on the coffee table.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.233
It's from Dorothy too.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.834
If I had to thank her,
I'd choke on the words.

03:00.900 --> 03:02.734
Please risk it.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.467
-So tell me, Stanley--
-What?

03:06.533 --> 03:08.367
How are things at the novelty store?

03:08.433 --> 03:09.934
Oh, just great, Ma.
Couldn't be better.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.600
I was salesman of the month.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.967
And I'm sure
that you'll be proud to know

03:14.033 --> 03:18.734
that the name Zbornak has become
synonymous with plastic vomit.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.333
I would love some tea.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.033
Oh, sure, Stanley.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.133
Anything you want, sweetheart.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.934
Dorothy,
you have to start being nice to her.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.734
-We need that money.
-She wouldn't refuse you.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.600
It would break mama's heart
if she knew I'd failed.

03:40.667 --> 03:43.667
To her, I'm Rockefeller,
Gary Cooper,

03:43.734 --> 03:46.600
-and Cary Grant rolled into one.
-I'm not surprised.

03:46.667 --> 03:50.066
The woman drinks grain alcohol
out of a measuring cup.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.433
Here's the tea.

04:02.433 --> 04:03.900
This is just hot water.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.633
Enjoy.

04:11.567 --> 04:14.800
I just remembered.
I have an important call to make.

04:14.867 --> 04:16.500
You know the
novelty business.

04:16.567 --> 04:19.967
The pay phone's at the end
of the trailer court.

04:24.633 --> 04:27.333
What are you here for, money?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.200
No, absolutely not.
How did you know?

04:30.266 --> 04:33.767
I got the feeling
my yutz son crapped out again.

04:33.834 --> 04:38.166
I've never heard you say anything
bad about Stan.

04:38.233 --> 04:39.700
I don't have to.

04:39.767 --> 04:44.066
The whole world makes fun of him.
Always has.

04:44.133 --> 04:46.600
That's why I make him out
to be more than he is.

04:46.667 --> 04:48.000
You'll give him the money?

04:48.066 --> 04:52.600
No, but I'll give it to you
under one condition.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.033
Don't ever tell Stanley
it came from me.

04:55.100 --> 04:56.433
I don't understand.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.166
Stanley tends to be weak.

04:59.233 --> 05:01.367
If he knew I was a soft touch,

05:01.433 --> 05:04.367
he'd never amount to anything.
How much?

05:04.433 --> 05:05.967
$500.

05:10.166 --> 05:11.500
I'll give you 1,000.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.233
You know, Dorothy,
I'm glad Stanley married you.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.734
You love him, but you're tough
on him, and he needs that.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.000
Why are you mean to me?

05:22.066 --> 05:26.767
If Stanley knew I liked you,
he'd hang around all the time.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.200
Who needs a yutz around here?

05:33.433 --> 05:34.367
Dorothy.

05:34.433 --> 05:36.867
Oh, thank God you're here.

05:36.934 --> 05:39.000
I thought she was
going to strangle me.

05:41.433 --> 05:43.767
-You weren't able to--
-We'll figure something out.

05:43.834 --> 05:45.633
We should get going.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.333
I'll call, Mama.
Happy Mother's Day.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.333
-Goodbye, sweetheart.
-Happy Mother's Day.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.033
Yeah, right.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.100
Stan's mother wasn't
so bad after all.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.967
The woman wasn't human.
I think she ate mice.

06:12.934 --> 06:15.000
(telephone rings)

06:17.233 --> 06:18.667
Hello.

06:18.734 --> 06:20.700
Charlie!

06:20.767 --> 06:23.100
Hey, everyone, it's Charlie Jr.

06:24.100 --> 06:27.934
Oh... guess what.
He says it's cold in Minnesota.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.500
Get out of here.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.333
Is it cold enough

06:32.400 --> 06:36.200
that if you put your tongue
on something metal, it'll stick?

06:36.266 --> 06:37.900
Sure, I'll hold.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.100
This might be the time
to leave for that brunch.

06:49.166 --> 06:52.266
The last Mother's Day
I spent with mama,

06:52.333 --> 06:54.133
I was back in Virginia.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.800
Mama had been ill,

06:55.867 --> 06:58.767
and she was recovering
in a convalescent home.

07:01.033 --> 07:02.900
You stay right there.

07:02.967 --> 07:07.100
I want you watch the proper way
for a lady to make an entrance.

07:07.166 --> 07:10.000
On the arm of a handsome gentleman.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.967
You look just wonderful, Mama.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.000
Happy Mother's Day.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.066
Is today Mother's Day?

07:23.133 --> 07:24.533
Why, yes, ma'am,
don't you remember?

07:24.600 --> 07:26.600
I called you
and told you I'd be here.

07:26.667 --> 07:27.700
Of course.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.100
Of course, Virginia.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.700
No, darling, Virginia couldn't come.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.000
I'm Blanche.

07:33.066 --> 07:34.834
Here. Look.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.467
I brought you a little present.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.834
Lace handkerchiefs. My...

07:41.900 --> 07:44.433
Well, you always used to say that

07:44.500 --> 07:47.867
there were two things a lady
could never have enough of,

07:47.934 --> 07:50.967
lace handkerchiefs
and gentlemen callers.

07:52.633 --> 07:55.934
Maybe next Mother's Day
I'll bring you a gentleman caller.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.133
(bell dings)

07:59.200 --> 08:01.500
You want to go have some tea?

08:01.567 --> 08:03.934
Not right now, darling.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.266
Mama...

08:06.233 --> 08:09.767
do you remember that Mother's Day
that I almost ruined

08:09.834 --> 08:11.767
when I ran off to get married?

08:12.800 --> 08:13.700
No.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.300
Sure you do, honey.

08:17.367 --> 08:22.967
I was a high school senior,
madly in love with Deck Bovinglowe.

08:23.033 --> 08:26.834
We'd been dating a month,
so it seemed logical

08:26.900 --> 08:30.900
when he dropped by cheerleading
practice and asked me to marry him.

08:30.967 --> 08:35.200
I thought he was a wonderful catch
at the time.

08:35.266 --> 08:37.800
He was 40, out of work...

08:39.233 --> 08:42.600
twice-divorced, had three kids.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.467
But the real reason
I wanted to marry him

08:45.533 --> 08:50.166
was because his oldest daughter
was my rival at cheerleading.

08:50.233 --> 08:53.367
I figured if I married Deck,
I'd be her mama.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.033
And I could kick her
off the squad.

08:58.633 --> 09:01.900
I remember next day,
I was in the Rexall

09:01.967 --> 09:06.934
when Deck came in looking more
handsome than I've ever seen him,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.600
black motorcycle boots,
skintight levis,

09:11.667 --> 09:14.033
a match in his mouth,

09:14.100 --> 09:17.767
and a white t-shirt
with the sleeves rolled up

09:17.834 --> 09:21.333
to reveal his brand-new woody
the woodpecker tattoo.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.300
God, I was an idiot.

09:27.266 --> 09:31.166
Anyway, he sauntered over to me
at the soda fountain

09:31.233 --> 09:35.433
and gave me this long,
smoldering look and said...

09:37.133 --> 09:38.266
"so?"

09:38.767 --> 09:41.900
Oh, I nearly fainted
dead away on the spot.

09:41.967 --> 09:45.533
Next thing, I was sitting next to
him in that souped-up Studebaker,

09:45.600 --> 09:49.233
racing toward this justice
of the peace

09:49.300 --> 09:51.800
who specialized in marrying
stupid teenage girls

09:51.867 --> 09:54.467
from well-to-do families.

09:54.533 --> 09:58.100
Lucky for me, old man Montgomery
had been in the Rexall that day

09:58.166 --> 10:01.767
and overheard our plans
and tipped off you and daddy.

10:01.834 --> 10:05.233
I never did learn
how you got there before us.

10:05.300 --> 10:10.166
But when we pulled up
to Bubba's chapel of bliss...

10:12.033 --> 10:13.600
and tackle shop...

10:16.767 --> 10:18.266
there you were.

10:18.333 --> 10:21.700
Well, I was ready for
the fight of my life,

10:21.767 --> 10:23.533
but all you said was,

10:23.600 --> 10:28.166
"Why, darling, I just came to give
you away with my blessing.

10:28.233 --> 10:33.333
Marrying Deck might be the
best thing in the world for you."

10:35.967 --> 10:40.633
Well, at 17, I wasn't about to do
anything you wanted me to do.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.567
And you knew that.

10:45.967 --> 10:48.300
I gave Deck back
his I.D. bracelet...

10:50.266 --> 10:52.533
that had "Deck" on one side

10:52.600 --> 10:55.000
and "allergic to the law"
on the other...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.567
hopped in the car
with you and daddy,

10:59.633 --> 11:00.967
and we took off home.

11:02.734 --> 11:04.600
I asked if you were mad at me.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.266
You said, "Why, no, darling,

11:08.333 --> 11:11.033
this is the best Mother's Day
I've ever had."

11:13.700 --> 11:15.700
Don't you remember that,
Mama?

11:16.767 --> 11:19.500
Well, I thought that
happened to Virginia.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.900
Wasn't Virginia the slut?

11:32.533 --> 11:34.200
No, ma'am, that was me.

11:44.166 --> 11:47.133
Blanche, that didn't
happen on Mother's Day.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.166
That happened Christmas day.

11:50.233 --> 11:51.500
19...

11:52.066 --> 11:54.400
1949.

11:57.066 --> 11:59.000
You're right.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.667
Hey, that was Christmas.

12:01.734 --> 12:03.734
You remembered, Mama.

12:03.800 --> 12:08.934
Blanche, there are days
when I can't remember who I am.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.233
But trust me, I remember every stunt
you ever pulled.

12:15.900 --> 12:21.166
That's how I got half the gray hairs
on this 85-year-old head.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.033
Honey, you're 89.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.767
Darling,
didn't I ever teach you anything?

12:29.433 --> 12:34.967
No true lady ever tells her age.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.700
Happy Mother's Day,
Mama.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.200
(calm music playing)

12:46.200 --> 12:50.967
(mellow music playing)

12:51.467 --> 12:54.500
Bye, Charlie.
Thanks for calling.

12:54.567 --> 12:55.500
Now can we go eat?

12:55.567 --> 12:58.133
No. I haven't heard
from Michael yet.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.934
Wait for your call.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.633
My blood sugar will drop.
I'll have a stroke.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.633
This corsage will live
longer than I will.

13:05.700 --> 13:08.066
You know how much it means

13:08.133 --> 13:10.233
to hear from your child
on Mother's Day.

13:10.300 --> 13:13.800
I remember one Mother's Day I
spent with somebody's else's mother.

13:13.867 --> 13:18.600
I was on my way to St. Olaf. I was
stuck in this little bus station.

13:21.533 --> 13:25.266
You know, I think I'd almost
forgotten what real cold feels like.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.700
I've gotten used to
tropical weather.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.834
-You here from Nebraska?
-Miami.

13:30.900 --> 13:34.867
Miami... that closer
to Omaha or Lincoln?

13:36.333 --> 13:38.200
Gee, it's great to be home.

13:40.900 --> 13:44.133
They said in Minneapolis I could
change buses here for St. Olaf.

13:44.200 --> 13:45.900
-That's right.
-How much?

13:45.967 --> 13:48.233
You want the express or yokel?

13:48.300 --> 13:51.000
-Local?
-No, yokel.

13:51.066 --> 13:53.734
On the yokel, a family of first
cousins plays banjo

13:53.800 --> 13:55.834
as passengers board.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.433
Do they take requests?

13:58.500 --> 14:00.500
-No.
-Give me the express.

14:02.266 --> 14:05.100
-You've got an hour to kill.
-Oh, ok.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.667
Excuse me.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.700
Are you taking the bus
to Northern Falls?

14:14.767 --> 14:16.200
No. St. Olaf.

14:16.266 --> 14:19.667
I've visited there.
Lovely little town.

14:19.734 --> 14:22.400
Oh, yes.
Yes, it is.

14:22.467 --> 14:26.200
Rolling hills...
charming homes...

14:26.266 --> 14:28.667
-Yes.
-Full of idiots.

14:31.533 --> 14:34.667
-Yes... I...
-What?

14:34.734 --> 14:37.166
I never saw anything like it.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.333
Must be the water.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.800
I grew up in St. Olaf.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.567
-My family lives there.
-Oh, no offense, dearie.

14:45.633 --> 14:48.700
I didn't say everyone
there was an idiot.

14:48.767 --> 14:51.133
It just seemed though,
that per capita

14:51.200 --> 14:53.734
they had more than their share.

14:55.233 --> 14:57.734
Oh, well, per capita,
you're probably right.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.300
You live in Northern Falls?

15:02.367 --> 15:05.033
No. I'm visiting my daughter.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.567
For Mother's Day?
Me too.

15:07.633 --> 15:11.000
Oh, not just my daughter.
All my children.

15:11.066 --> 15:14.600
They paid for my trip from Miami.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.066
They figured it would be cheaper
for me to come here

15:17.133 --> 15:19.533
than for them to fly there.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.133
They figured that out?

15:25.433 --> 15:28.967
And they live in St. Olaf?

15:29.033 --> 15:30.533
Yes.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.367
Oh, you must be
very proud of them.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.233
Oh, I am.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.200
When was it you visited St. Olaf?

15:39.266 --> 15:42.400
Lord, it must be
50 years ago now.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.600
I went to a wedding.

15:44.667 --> 15:48.133
A distant cousin of mine
married a St. Olaf girl.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.400
What was her name?

15:49.467 --> 15:51.867
Sonia Jungen...

15:52.367 --> 15:55.300
Jungenfraulichsteinerbrau?

15:56.567 --> 15:58.633
-You know her?
-Know her?

15:58.700 --> 16:02.066
I was flower girl at the wedding.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.266
Of course, there were
no flowers that year

16:04.333 --> 16:08.533
because of what happened
to old man Smith, our town florist.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.100
Also our town's only blacksmith.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.867
Come to think of it,
our town's only black man.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.734
Anyway, when he first moved in,

16:17.800 --> 16:22.467
the town council decided to give him
a traditional Scandinavian welcome,

16:22.533 --> 16:28.000
gathering on his front lawn, singing
songs, and dressing up in bedsheets.

16:33.834 --> 16:37.767
Of course, coming from Chattanooga,
he wasn't familiar with the custom.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.633
He had a heart attack.

16:40.700 --> 16:44.433
He spent most of the summer
in intensive care.

16:45.367 --> 16:47.033
After that,
when somebody new moved in,

16:47.100 --> 16:50.367
the town council
handed out peanut brittle

16:50.433 --> 16:54.900
and free passes to the movie house
they hoped to build.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.700
Are you all right? You seem upset.

16:58.700 --> 17:04.233
I was just thinking I'm sorry
I recently got a hearing aid.

17:04.300 --> 17:08.300
Oh, don't worry.
It hardly shows at all.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.200
Anyway, at Sonia's wedding,
of course, without flowers,

17:12.266 --> 17:13.734
they didn't know what to do...

17:14.133 --> 17:16.533
and discovered she was
actually on the hayride

17:16.600 --> 17:19.500
with little lars, not big lars.

17:19.567 --> 17:22.633
She yelled, "whoa,"
and jumped right off the wagon.

17:25.967 --> 17:29.033
Either that story is actually funny

17:29.100 --> 17:32.300
or the batteries are going
in and out on my hearing aid.

17:35.400 --> 17:41.367
Rose, I want you to know
that I think it's very sweet

17:41.433 --> 17:43.900
that you're keeping an old
lady company like this.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.600
Don't be silly.
I'm enjoying every minute.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.166
Every hour.

17:50.433 --> 17:53.233
I can't believe
the buses are so late.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.633
I should call the kids again.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.467
Shouldn't you call your daughter?

17:58.533 --> 18:00.800
Mother's Day isn't until tomorrow.

18:01.767 --> 18:04.600
She knows I'll be there.
I always am.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.333
-Still, she must be worried by now.
-Rose...

18:09.567 --> 18:10.934
my daughter's dead.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.633
She passed away
some time ago.

18:15.700 --> 18:18.333
I go to the cemetery
on Mother's Day.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.734
It was always such
a special day for us.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.033
I like to pretend it still is.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.633
(vehicle approaching)

18:25.700 --> 18:29.834
This year I don't think
I'm going to make it.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.200
Aren't you feeling well?

18:31.266 --> 18:34.066
I escaped from the home
to come here.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.100
They're catching up with me.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.066
Are you Anna Egerman?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.967
They're worried about you
back at the home.

18:46.033 --> 18:47.834
You'll have to come with me.

18:47.900 --> 18:51.367
Attention!
Express to Cedar Grove,

18:51.433 --> 18:55.400
river junction, Northern Falls,
now boarding!

18:55.467 --> 18:58.100
For crying out loud, Jacob.

18:58.166 --> 19:01.166
There's three people here.

19:01.233 --> 19:02.967
You could have
just pointed to the door.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.233
There's been a mistake.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.567
This woman's my mother.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.567
I have a telex that says--

19:09.633 --> 19:12.667
I don't care.
She's my mother.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.633
We're on our way home.

19:14.700 --> 19:17.467
Excuse us.
We have a bus to catch.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.033
Come on, Mama.

19:23.266 --> 19:24.734
Thank you, Rose.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.100
Happy Mother's Day.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.667
That's a really
sweet story, Rose.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.667
Yeah, right,
so sell it to reader's digest.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.000
Now, let's get out of here.

19:34.066 --> 19:36.967
(ringing)
That must be Michael.

19:38.667 --> 19:39.734
Hello.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.567
Hello, Michael.

19:41.633 --> 19:43.567
That's it.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.533
When she's off,
we're going for lunch.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.834
I'm tired of these lousy
Mother's Day stories.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.967
Don't you have a story?

19:51.033 --> 19:53.700
I said I was tired
of lousy ones.

19:53.767 --> 19:55.300
I wouldn't mind a good one.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.667
Picture
it, Brooklyn, 1957.

19:58.734 --> 20:00.400
The second Sunday in May.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.500
Dorothy picked up my mother.
I got the house ready.

20:03.567 --> 20:07.133
That meant getting Salvadore
into a shirt with sleeves.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.667
Turn that off.
Get up from the couch.

20:11.734 --> 20:14.533
Mama's coming.
You look like a bum.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.367
So, what's the problem?
She already thinks I'm a bum.

20:19.967 --> 20:21.834
-Salvadore.
-What?

20:21.900 --> 20:24.133
Did you get me
a Mother's Day present?

20:24.200 --> 20:25.600
You're not my mother.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.166
I'm your children's mother.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.133
A thousand nights of begging.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.467
Three times you said yes.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.200
For that you want a present?

20:33.266 --> 20:36.300
It's not enough they declared
a national holiday?

20:36.367 --> 20:38.000
(knock on door)

20:38.066 --> 20:39.000
That's mama.

20:39.066 --> 20:41.800
She sees you like this,
she'll never move in.

20:41.867 --> 20:45.266
Get moving. Move! Move!

20:45.333 --> 20:47.567
Today's a dark day in Brooklyn.

20:47.633 --> 20:49.767
The dodgers move out,
your mother moves in!

20:51.333 --> 20:52.767
Ok, grandma.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.066
Here we are.

20:54.133 --> 20:56.033
I'm in a wheelchair.
I'm not blind.

20:56.100 --> 20:57.767
I see where we are.

20:57.834 --> 21:00.633
It needs a good vacuum.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.133
Hi, Dorothy.
Hello, Mama.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.233
Where's Salvadore?
He's hiding from me, isn't he?

21:07.300 --> 21:08.800
The little monkey hates me.

21:08.867 --> 21:11.900
Grandma, don't be silly.
Pop's crazy about you.

21:11.967 --> 21:14.567
Don't lie.
It's a sin.

21:14.633 --> 21:18.433
Maybe he's not crazy about you,
but he's fond of you.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.800
He hates me.

21:19.867 --> 21:22.834
The man repairs complicated
machinery for a living.

21:22.900 --> 21:26.266
He couldn't set the hand brake
on my wheelchair.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.867
That was a coincidence.

21:27.934 --> 21:33.100
It was at the top of the stairs
to the Flatbush subway station.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.667
If Salvadore hates you,

21:35.734 --> 21:38.333
why does he want you
to live with us?

21:38.400 --> 21:41.333
-What?
-We'd like you to move in.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.266
I am not moving in.

21:43.333 --> 21:44.133
Why not?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.066
Let me tell you a story.

21:46.133 --> 21:48.800
Picture it, Sicily, 1881.

21:50.266 --> 21:52.200
A beautiful young peasant girl--

21:52.266 --> 21:53.800
Mama, not another story.

21:53.867 --> 21:55.233
Sophia, come closer.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.867
-Grandma!
-That's it. You're moving in here.

21:59.934 --> 22:02.000
It's best for you.

22:02.066 --> 22:04.533
Best?
You didn't discuss it with me.

22:04.600 --> 22:06.000
Fine. Let's discuss it.

22:06.066 --> 22:09.767
There's nothing to discuss.
I'm not moving in.

22:09.834 --> 22:14.200
Dorothy, if I ever do this to you,
shoot me.

22:14.266 --> 22:18.567
-Could you put that in writing?
-Dorothy, come closer.

22:21.567 --> 22:24.133
I can solve this problem.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.967
You taking me to the top
of the stairs?

22:27.033 --> 22:29.100
You think I don't want you?

22:29.166 --> 22:31.934
A man's home is his castle.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.100
I'm the king here, <i>capisce?</i>

22:34.166 --> 22:38.233
-He's talking nonsense.
-What are you saying?

22:38.300 --> 22:40.066
I'm saying I want you to move in.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.700
-Mean that?
-No.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.900
Too bad. You said it.

22:43.967 --> 22:46.734
Happy Mother's Day, Mama.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.734
Please.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.800
Happy Mother's Day, Ma.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.800
Ok, honey. Just a second.
Ma, he wants to talk to you.

23:02.734 --> 23:04.533
Hello, Michael.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.100
Have you eaten?

23:06.166 --> 23:08.633
Well, I haven't. Goodbye.

23:08.700 --> 23:09.700
Let's roll.

23:09.767 --> 23:11.567
Sophia, we can't.

23:11.633 --> 23:13.066
We haven't all gotten our calls.

23:13.133 --> 23:15.433
Oh, forget it.
She's not going to call.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.200
(rings)

23:22.166 --> 23:24.100
Hello.

23:24.166 --> 23:27.033
Janet, it's so good
to hear your voice.

23:34.066 --> 23:36.667
-Ma, what are you doing?
-Cooking.

23:36.734 --> 23:40.000
If I wait for you,
I'll starve to death.

23:40.066 --> 23:41.700
You're making me feel guilty.

23:41.767 --> 23:43.900
I know. It's Mother's Day.

23:43.967 --> 23:47.700
You celebrate your way,
I'll celebrate mine.

23:53.934 --> 23:58.433
(theme music playing)
