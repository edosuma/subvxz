WEBVTT

01:44.271 --> 01:46.356
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.169
- Looking for something?
- Yeah.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.588
A hardcover
of <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God.</i>

02:10.797 --> 02:13.258
Hardcover? Yeah. I think we have one.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.406
Thanks.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.077
You know, I actually haven't read
much Hurston.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.161
Yeah, she's great.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.956
It's actually a gift for my professor.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.499
Okay. You're a student.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.209
Getting my PhD.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.672
- Columbia? NYU?
- NYU.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.174
Nice. What's your--
What's your thesis topic?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.634
"Redefining Radicalism:

02:55.634 --> 02:57.553
The Rise of Black Feminism
in American Literature."

02:57.553 --> 02:58.929
Oh, wow.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.597
That's a mouthful.

03:01.890 --> 03:05.227
- How's that going?
- Slowly. Very slowly.

03:05.227 --> 03:06.478
Oh, yeah?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.230
- <i>Irma Thomas</i>...
- Well, I'm impressed.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.567
...<i>"Ruler of my Heart" on</i> WNYC.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.985
That'll be 15 even.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.653
- ...<i>New York public radio.</i>
- Thank you.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.321
<i>I'm John Schaefer,</i>

03:16.321 --> 03:19.992
<i>and if the soul queen of New Orleans
couldn't lighten the mood,</i>

03:19.992 --> 03:21.743
<i>maybe Duke Ellington will.</i>

03:21.743 --> 03:23.245
<i>Here's his classic version</i>

03:23.245 --> 03:27.624
of <i>"In a Sentimental Mood,"
featuring John Coltrane.</i>

03:29.877 --> 03:33.088
There's actually this
little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.302
If you're not doing anything later,
dinner's on me.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.804
Sorry.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.807
No. That's--

03:43.807 --> 03:46.518
- You probably have a boyfriend.
- No, I don't. I'm single.

03:48.270 --> 03:52.316
I'm-I'm single,
and I kinda like being single.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.818
Oh, yeah. No, I totally get that.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.071
Your card's not going through.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.698
I must've maxed it out again.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.534
- Let me see if I have enough cash.
- It's fine. It's fine.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.165
You know what?
Actually just take the book.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.792
No, I couldn't.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.545
- What if someone else came in looking--
- They can order it online.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.048
Or whatever. It's fine.
You can come back and pay for it later.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.593
- Thank you. I--
- Yeah.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.803
- I promise I'll be back with the money.
- Yeah.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.598
Thank you.

04:25.098 --> 04:25.974
- Bye.
- See ya.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.360
You probably have a boyfriend.

04:39.238 --> 04:41.156
Idiot. "Probably have a boyfriend."

04:50.582 --> 04:51.959
- Hi. Remember me?
- Hey.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.210
Yeah.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.711
Got your money.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.630
You didn't have to do that today.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.215
I didn't wanna leave you hanging.

05:00.259 --> 05:01.176
Thank you.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.554
Just keep the change.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.223
Okay. Thanks.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.059
Okay. Well. See ya.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.854
- All right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.272
- Have a good one.
- You too.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.406
- Hey.
- Hello.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.118
So, remember this morning
when you asked me out to dinner?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.620
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
- No, no, no.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.582
I-- I actually wanted to say yes.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.667
I was standing there

05:33.667 --> 05:35.460
thinking how nice it would be
if this guy asked me out,

05:35.460 --> 05:37.421
and right as I thought it, you did.
And I--

05:37.921 --> 05:40.048
I don't know. I panicked.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.884
You panicked?

05:41.884 --> 05:43.343
I panicked.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.221
I'm Sandra.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.390
Tom.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.100
Nice to meet you, Tom.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.103
Nice to meet you.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.191
- So, Mott Street?
- Yeah. If that-- Yeah.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.068
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.
- This way.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.155
- You-- After you. Yeah.
- All right.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.865
I have my bag.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.743
No, I do too. It's getting kind of cold.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.620
- That--
- Sorry...

06:09.620 --> 06:10.829
- Backpack buddies.
- Buddies.

06:10.829 --> 06:14.082
Yeah, and, like,
what have I gotten myself into?

06:14.082 --> 06:16.376
You know?
Like, a short story is one thing.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.922
- A novel, that's, like, 300 pages and--
- I know. And sometimes more.

06:19.922 --> 06:22.633
Exactly. And, you know, here they are
offering me real money, you know?

06:22.633 --> 06:24.009
I have to deliver something.

06:24.009 --> 06:28.055
- So, what'd you do?
- I had a year-long panic attack, and I--

06:28.055 --> 06:29.806
I wrote this book that was terrible.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.683
Come on. I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.186
No, no, it was bad. It was-- It was awful.
They wouldn't publish it.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.188
Ouch.

06:36.188 --> 06:37.272
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.816
No, it's fine. You know,
at least I got to keep the advance.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.611
Do you still write?

06:42.611 --> 06:44.530
No. Not really.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.866
You know, all this happened
around the time that my mom died, and--

06:49.826 --> 06:50.661
I don't know, I--

06:50.661 --> 06:54.748
Things got dark for me,
and I kinda just gave up.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.086
My parents died when I was a kid.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.589
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.384
Must've been tough.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.514
Anyway, yeah.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.766
I started managing the bookstore.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.978
That kinda pulled me out
of my depression, or whatever.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.939
And, yeah, it takes up most of my time.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.983
Must be nice being surrounded
by books all day.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.402
It's the best.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.156
After my parents passed,

07:28.156 --> 07:31.827
my brother and I hopped
from one foster family to the next.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.246
One point,
we were staying with this couple

07:34.246 --> 07:36.456
that had this great collection of novels.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.336
And one night, I started reading
<i>Jane Eyre,</i> and here was this character

07:41.336 --> 07:43.589
that was, sort of, going through
everything I was going through.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.550
And I didn't want it to end.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.929
I finished it, went back to page one
and started reading it all over again.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.600
Just loved books ever since.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.227
<i>Jane Eyre,</i> huh?

07:58.896 --> 07:59.897
<i>Jane Eyre.</i>

08:02.941 --> 08:04.026
Can I show you something?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.158
Oh, my God.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.036
Is this a first edition?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.123
Is this real?

09:02.584 --> 09:03.585
This is real.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.424
How can I be sure?

09:29.278 --> 09:31.822
<i>I mean, some of these professors
are so obnoxious.</i>

09:31.822 --> 09:35.951
Actually used the phrase
"the vaginization of German literature."

09:35.951 --> 09:37.411
- The what?
- I mean, I'm pretty sure

09:37.411 --> 09:39.538
"vaginization" isn't even a real word.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.791
Where'd you learn how to cook?

09:42.791 --> 09:44.626
I spent my junior year in Florence.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.461
<i>Do you speak Italian?</i>

09:46.962 --> 09:48.589
<i>I used to speak it well,</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:51.633
- now it's a bit rusty, unfortunately.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.051
- Hello!
- <i>Did you like Italy?</i>

09:55.137 --> 09:56.555
<i>I have great memories.</i>

09:56.555 --> 09:57.931
This is amazing!

09:57.931 --> 10:01.268
But, I had this boyfriend
who was a real jerk.

10:06.732 --> 10:09.318
And what about you?
Where did you learn to speak Italian?

10:09.318 --> 10:11.528
My mom was from Italy.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.823
- And I watch a lot of Fellini movies.
- <i>I love Fellini.</i>

10:15.949 --> 10:18.202
<i>Have you ever had your heart broken?</i>

10:20.829 --> 10:21.872
<i>Yeah, once or twice.</i>

10:46.396 --> 10:47.648
I really like you.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.281
Okay.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.705
I really like you too.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.586
Okay.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.174
- Just hear me out.
- No, just-- No, I can't.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.343
- I need your help.
- I'm not doing this.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.011
- What do you mean you're not doing this?
- I can't.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.013
It's me and you.
It's me and you against the world,

11:20.013 --> 11:21.682
- do you remember that?
- Can you please just go?

11:21.682 --> 11:23.934
- It's me and you against the world.
- Jason, I need you to stop.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.854
Please, I need you. Don't walk out
on me. You are the last thing that I have

11:26.854 --> 11:28.355
- on this earth. You are the last person--
- Jason!

11:28.355 --> 11:30.691
- Sandra!
- Jason, please don't.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.484
Sandra!

11:32.484 --> 11:33.944
- Just go. Just go.
- Please.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.947
Please open the door.
Sandra, Sandra, open the door.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.534
Fuck! Fuck!

11:42.035 --> 11:43.161
Fucking bitch.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.124
Are you okay?

11:50.002 --> 11:51.003
Who was that?

11:53.922 --> 11:55.465
It's my brother. He needs money.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.596
Jason wasn't so lucky.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.932
Some of the homes he was put in were...

12:06.310 --> 12:07.686
a nightmare.

12:08.604 --> 12:09.897
It's not your fault.

12:12.482 --> 12:15.777
I know, but he's the only family I got.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.241
"All happy families are alike."
And all that.

12:24.995 --> 12:28.165
No matter how many times
he screws me over, I can't not help him.

12:29.166 --> 12:32.127
He's my brother. I love him.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.922
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:35.506 --> 12:40.511
<i>Happy birthday, dear Tom</i>

12:41.220 --> 12:45.849
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

12:45.849 --> 12:48.352
Yay. Okay, you gotta blow. Blow here.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.146
You gotta blow harder. Come on.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.564
Harder. Come on.

12:52.564 --> 12:55.484
Yes! Yes! Yes! We got it. We got it.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.611
<i>So, how long have you known Tom?</i>

12:57.611 --> 12:59.696
Just a few weeks.

13:00.739 --> 13:04.952
- Seems like so much longer.
- Yeah, I know. It's been kind of intense.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.121
She's like a sexy librarian or something.

13:09.540 --> 13:14.878
- She's-- She's literally your dream girl.
- I know. She's just incredible.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.964
- Where did you go to undergrad?
- Vassar.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.550
Oh, my God. So did I.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.928
You know, I thought you looked familiar.
When did you graduate?

13:22.928 --> 13:24.012
Class of '14.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.097
Class of '16.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.015
Did you hang out at the Mug a lot?

13:27.808 --> 13:30.769
Honestly, I spent most of my time
at the library.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.691
But don't tell Tom. I'm trying to maintain
the illusion I'm not a total nerd.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.776
Glad to see that you're doing okay.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.863
You were in a bad place there, so...

13:40.863 --> 13:42.197
I was just a little depressed.

13:45.868 --> 13:48.328
Okay. It got bad but, you know, it's like,

13:48.328 --> 13:50.956
who hasn't been borderline suicidal
at some point in their life?

13:51.707 --> 13:53.792
It's not funny.
Not supposed to joke about that stuff.

13:53.792 --> 13:57.087
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, you're right.

13:57.087 --> 14:00.132
But I'm good now.

14:00.132 --> 14:04.011
You know, like, I'm great, actually.

14:06.680 --> 14:10.976
It was pretty great.
Yeah, we actually met in the bookstore.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.232
Hi.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.948
How come we always come back to my place?

14:27.075 --> 14:28.076
What do you mean?

14:30.162 --> 14:31.997
I wanna see where you live.

14:32.581 --> 14:36.084
It's-- It's kind of uncomfortable there.

14:39.171 --> 14:42.382
Well, my place
isn't exactly the Four Seasons.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.176
No, it's not that. It's...

14:46.178 --> 14:48.805
I live with my dad and his new wife, and...

14:50.682 --> 14:52.518
My dad and I don't really get along.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.858
He thinks I'm a disappointment.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.153
"All happy families are alike."

15:04.530 --> 15:05.656
And all that, right?

15:09.493 --> 15:12.371
Anyways, he's really sick, so...

15:15.290 --> 15:16.333
Sorry he's sick.

15:18.252 --> 15:19.253
It's okay.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.757
But you're not a disappointment.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.495
Sandra?

16:02.754 --> 16:03.672
Hey.

16:04.256 --> 16:05.174
Are you okay?

16:05.674 --> 16:09.344
You're not--
You're not returning my texts.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.639
I'm sorry.

16:14.683 --> 16:17.477
My brother's in trouble.
He owes them money,

16:17.477 --> 16:20.063
so they cracked three of his ribs,
broke his cheekbone.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.233
Said if he didn't pay up,
they'd come back and finish the job.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.401
How much does he owe them?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.069
Paying them back is not an option.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.488
- So, what is an option?
- I give him money, and he runs.

16:28.488 --> 16:32.659
Okay. So, say he runs,
and they can't find him.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.912
Who do you think
they're gonna come looking for to collect?

16:34.912 --> 16:37.623
Me? No, they don't even know I exist.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.708
- Are you sure?
- I'm not sure of anything.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.547
- You have to pay them off.
- I told you that's not possible.

16:45.547 --> 16:48.175
- How much do they want?
- $350,000.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.677
And they want it in four days,

16:50.677 --> 16:52.721
so short of robbing a bank,
that's just not gonna happen.

16:54.348 --> 16:55.432
I can give you the money.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.520
- What?
- It's in the bank.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.646
I can just go make a withdrawal.

17:00.646 --> 17:02.940
You wouldn't have to rob it.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.108
I don't understand. You live at home.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.029
- You work in a bookstore.
- No, I own a bookstore.

17:09.530 --> 17:12.324
How do you think I manage to keep it open?
All that place does is lose money.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.867
You're saying you have that money
just sitting in a bank?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.079
Yeah. More. Yeah. My father has money.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.209
Why is this
the first time I'm hearing about this?

17:22.209 --> 17:23.961
Why does that matter?
Maybe I didn't want you to know.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.253
Well, honestly, it's kinda fucked up

17:25.253 --> 17:26.922
- that you didn't say anything.
- Are you kidding me?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.841
- I'm telling you that I can help you.
- I can't take your money.

17:28.841 --> 17:31.635
- Why not?
- Because it's $350,000. That's why.

17:33.470 --> 17:35.305
I appreciate the offer. I really do.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.474
But let's face it,
we're practically strangers.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.774
First of all, it's not my money,
it's my father's money.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.402
And it's not like he earned it
in some noble way.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.653
He has a hedge fund.

17:50.320 --> 17:55.409
And second of all,
fuck you for saying we're strangers.

17:58.704 --> 18:00.372
You are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.005
<i>I'm going to pay you back,
no matter how long it takes.</i>

18:08.005 --> 18:10.382
<i>That's okay. I wish
you'd let me come with you though.</i>

18:10.382 --> 18:12.843
<i>I told you I don't want you
anywhere near these people.</i>

18:12.843 --> 18:14.136
- It's all there.
- Got it.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.306
<i>I'll be fine. What are you doing tonight?</i>

18:18.473 --> 18:21.476
I'm-- I was hoping to hang out
with this pretty girl that I know.

18:22.186 --> 18:25.397
Well, there's this great
little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.608
If you're not doing anything,
dinner's on me.

18:31.195 --> 18:32.196
Hey.

18:39.494 --> 18:40.370
I love you.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.748
I'm so sorry about all this.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.009
All right.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.263
Sandra?

19:41.723 --> 19:43.392
Sandra, are you okay?

19:45.978 --> 19:49.231
Sandra! Sandra!

19:54.528 --> 19:55.529
Sandra!

19:58.949 --> 19:59.950
Sandra!

20:41.491 --> 20:42.576
Shit.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.427
How's Christmas Day? It's not that bad.

21:02.221 --> 21:03.472
Hey, you Larusso?

21:05.974 --> 21:07.017
Over here.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.398
- You're pretty late, Sandy.
- I'm sorry.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.567
There's no cabs.
It's fucking Christmas Eve.

21:16.652 --> 21:17.736
Where's Carl?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.781
Mr. Knutson's wife is sick.
I'll be taking over for him.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.324
Carl usually--

21:22.991 --> 21:25.953
Mr. Knutson usually has us meet
in his office.

21:25.953 --> 21:28.372
Yeah, I thought we'd meet somewhere
a little less formal given the holiday.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.791
But if you'd rather go to my office,
we can do that.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.000
No, it's fine.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.085
Great. Have a seat.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.842
- So, where were you tonight?
- Nowhere.

21:42.553 --> 21:44.054
Just with a friend. Girl I work with.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.806
- A girl you work with at Starbucks?
- Yeah.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.559
Caroline.
I can give you her number if you want.

21:48.559 --> 21:49.810
That won't be necessary.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.520
- Did you do any drugs tonight, Sandy?
- No.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.981
Did you engage in any behavior
that would violate your parole?

21:53.981 --> 21:55.482
Nope. No.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.943
How is that job? You doing good?

21:57.943 --> 21:59.945
Yeah. It's fine.

21:59.945 --> 22:03.657
Yeah. Starbucks is great.
There's lots of opportunity there.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.659
Yeah, I love it.

22:06.577 --> 22:07.870
Yeah.

22:07.870 --> 22:08.829
The thing is, Sandy,

22:08.829 --> 22:11.373
I went to your job and they told me
you haven't been there in a month.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.336
Yeah. I can explain.

22:18.297 --> 22:20.591
- I got into a fight with the manager...
- Yeah.

22:20.591 --> 22:23.218
...'cause he's a real--
he's a real fucking perv, okay?

22:23.218 --> 22:24.803
And I've been looking
for another job, so--

22:24.803 --> 22:26.430
Having a job is
a part of your parole agreement.

22:26.430 --> 22:27.806
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.224
So, you getting fired is strike one.

22:29.224 --> 22:30.851
So, let me ask you a question.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.895
If I give you a drug test right now,
how would that go?

22:33.478 --> 22:35.689
- Negative.
- Negative? Are you sure?

22:36.356 --> 22:38.942
Because if I gotta go to my car
and take the trouble to get a test,

22:38.942 --> 22:41.904
and it comes back positive,
I'm gonna be very goddamn upset.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.198
So, tell me how would that go?

22:47.367 --> 22:50.287
- I smoked some weed the other night.
- That is strike two.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.914
I can bring you in right now.

22:51.914 --> 22:53.040
Your list of priors,

22:53.040 --> 22:55.292
- you aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
- I know, I know, I know.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.793
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

22:56.793 --> 22:59.087
Give me one reason not to bring you in.

23:04.343 --> 23:05.469
I'll give you money.

23:05.469 --> 23:08.263
And that is attempted bribery.
Strike three.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.724
Congratulations, Sandy,
that's the whole fucking ball game.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.018
- So stand up and turn around now.
- I-- Okay. No, no. Come on.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.978
- Look, I can give you a lot of money.
- What is a lot of money?

23:14.978 --> 23:17.064
Whatever you wanted.
Look, I know where to get it,

23:17.064 --> 23:18.649
and you know I ain't lying to you,
Miss Larusso,

23:18.649 --> 23:20.859
- because you're my parole officer and--
- What are you doing?

23:21.860 --> 23:23.987
What do you mean?
Nothing. What the fuck?

23:23.987 --> 23:26.198
- Are you recording me?
- No! No, stop. Look--

23:26.198 --> 23:27.324
Are you trying to entrap me?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.284
- No, it ain't like that.
- What the fuck are you thinking?

23:29.284 --> 23:30.702
- No, no, no. Look--
- Do you think I'm an asshole?

23:30.702 --> 23:32.162
I do. I think you're an asshole.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.915
Sir, I'm a parole officer
and this young lady is my parolee...

23:34.915 --> 23:36.250
- Yeah.
- ...and none of this is your concern.

23:36.250 --> 23:37.334
You're shaking her down.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.169
I've watched you do it
to parolees all night.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.422
What do you want?

23:47.469 --> 23:49.054
How about I pay you to walk away?

23:49.638 --> 23:50.639
How much?

23:51.181 --> 23:52.307
How much do I have?

23:56.728 --> 23:58.355
Let's see.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.024
That's twen--

24:01.024 --> 24:04.152
45, 46, 47.

24:04.152 --> 24:09.157
That's ten, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

24:10.117 --> 24:11.118
Oh, shit.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.663
Two hundred. Three hundred, 400.

24:14.663 --> 24:18.667
That's $447.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.381
You're looking at this?

24:27.759 --> 24:28.760
Okay.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.976
- That's a Rolex Submariner.
- Yeah, I know what a Rolex is.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.187
You must be drunk.

24:42.107 --> 24:44.818
Yeah, maybe I am.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.448
I'm sorry.

24:51.992 --> 24:52.993
Sorry.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.248
Have a good night.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.547
Don't you fucking move.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.389
Wait up.

25:17.476 --> 25:18.393
Let's talk.

25:19.269 --> 25:22.648
I've got a wife and I got two kids,
and I'm just trying to provide.

25:23.232 --> 25:25.817
And this one has it coming
because she is a fuckup.

25:25.817 --> 25:28.737
- Eat shit.
- Keep it up, Sandy. Keep it up.

25:29.905 --> 25:31.615
How much is this gonna cost?

25:31.615 --> 25:33.116
- Five grand.
- Good night.

25:33.116 --> 25:34.409
No, no, no. No, no, no.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.871
I just saw your car
and you are walking around here,

25:37.871 --> 25:41.708
sporting an $8,500 watch,
that you were just gonna give me.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.086
I only have $447.

25:44.086 --> 25:46.713
- I'll take the watch.
- That's 8,500. Like you said.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.758
Eighty-five hundred, new? Correct?

25:49.758 --> 25:52.177
What is it used? Maybe seven?

25:53.178 --> 25:54.429
Maybe.

25:54.429 --> 25:56.515
So, give me the watch
and I'll give you the change.

26:06.900 --> 26:07.901
Thanks.

26:16.410 --> 26:18.120
Happy holidays, motherfucker.

26:48.817 --> 26:49.818
It wasn't real?

26:51.695 --> 26:52.696
Get in.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.326
I gotta give you your cut.

26:59.036 --> 27:00.412
- My cut?
- Your money.

27:11.590 --> 27:12.591
Thousand dollars.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.219
Got a knife on me.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.721
Great.

27:20.182 --> 27:21.558
Come on, it's freezing out.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.017
Have a seat.

29:00.282 --> 29:01.992
You can take your jacket off.

29:06.705 --> 29:07.873
Don't try any shit.

29:14.254 --> 29:16.715
- Now take off your shoes.
- Fuck you.

29:27.059 --> 29:28.060
I need to trust you.

29:44.952 --> 29:46.119
I'm not a junkie.

29:54.419 --> 29:55.504
Roll up your sleeves.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.771
You can sleep there. Or you can leave.

30:17.109 --> 30:18.443
And what happens if I stay?

30:20.237 --> 30:21.321
You work for me.

30:46.388 --> 30:47.347
Morning.

30:53.437 --> 30:54.688
What's your favorite movie?

30:55.522 --> 30:56.565
What's my favorite movie?

30:57.858 --> 30:59.651
Yeah, what's your favorite movie?

31:01.069 --> 31:02.112
<i>Titanic.</i>

31:03.906 --> 31:05.073
That's a classic.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.701
- You like that movie?
- Of course.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.829
DiCaprio was so young in it.

31:11.705 --> 31:13.165
Honestly, he's never been better.

31:13.165 --> 31:14.541
I liked him in <i>The Departed.</i>

31:16.418 --> 31:20.756
He's okay, but <i>Titanic,</i>
that's the movie that made him.

31:21.632 --> 31:23.467
And Kate Winslet was so beautiful.

31:25.552 --> 31:28.847
And the end.
I'll still never get over that.

31:30.557 --> 31:31.725
Can't believe you like <i>Titanic.</i>

31:33.519 --> 31:35.020
I don't. I've never seen it.

31:36.730 --> 31:38.190
- You've never seen <i>Titanic</i>?
- No.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.901
I don't watch movies.
They're a waste of time.

31:41.485 --> 31:45.197
But I gave you the impression that I did,
and that's what we're gonna do with you.

31:45.197 --> 31:48.116
We're gonna give people the impression
that you're somebody that you're not.

31:49.493 --> 31:52.162
And when I'm done with you,
it's gonna be 100% convincing.

31:54.957 --> 31:57.084
We're gonna teach you
a little about everything.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.963
So that you can lie about anything.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.632
Read those cover to cover.

32:03.632 --> 32:05.092
You fucking kidding me?

32:06.343 --> 32:08.178
What did you do
with that $1,000 that I gave you?

32:08.178 --> 32:11.223
In my jacket. Why?

32:12.808 --> 32:14.685
From now on, each time you curse,
I get a hundred.

32:14.685 --> 32:16.228
Fuck that! That's my money.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.814
Now I get 200. You still got 800 left.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.191
Read those.

32:21.775 --> 32:22.734
What's your name?

32:22.734 --> 32:24.152
It's Max.

32:24.152 --> 32:25.237
Merry Christmas, Max.

32:27.030 --> 32:28.365
Merry Christmas, Sandra.

32:28.365 --> 32:29.658
Sandy.

32:30.701 --> 32:32.160
Everybody calls me Sandy.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.162
Not anymore.

33:52.366 --> 33:53.242
Max!

33:54.493 --> 33:57.371
Let me in. I promise
I won't do it anymore. Please!

34:02.000 --> 34:03.001
Max!

34:04.127 --> 34:06.755
Please, please, please!

34:36.577 --> 34:39.329
I need you clean. You understand?

34:42.416 --> 34:44.001
I gotta trust you.

35:09.109 --> 35:12.738
"But each unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way."

35:12.738 --> 35:15.324
- I was gonna say that.

- "It was the worst of times."

35:41.600 --> 35:42.601
- "Call me--"
- "Ishmael."

35:43.185 --> 35:44.978
- <i>Where'd you study?</i>
- <i>Vassar College.</i>

35:44.978 --> 35:47.272
- <i>From when to when?</i>
- 2012 to 2016.

35:47.272 --> 35:50.400
I lived in a dorm, Jewett, for two years,
then moved off campus.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.278
Didn't have much of a social life.
Spent all my time in the library.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.405
- <i>Am I the first?</i>
- <i>First what?</i>

35:55.405 --> 35:56.782
<i>First girl you've done this with?</i>

35:57.824 --> 35:58.825
Yes.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.035
Why did you pick me?

36:00.827 --> 36:02.996
- I saw something in you.
- <i>My brother's coming into town.</i>

36:02.996 --> 36:05.916
Every time I see him though,
he always asks for money.

36:05.916 --> 36:09.628
- Do you give him money?
- Sometimes. He's all I've got.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.422
You know, I'm from Seattle originally.
I've got a mom there.

36:12.422 --> 36:14.591
- She's crazy, but she's all right.
- What did you major in?

36:15.217 --> 36:17.135
At Vassar. What did you major in?

36:17.135 --> 36:19.179
English.
Just trying to make some conversation.

36:19.179 --> 36:21.098
Tell you about my mom.
What? You don't have a mom?

36:21.098 --> 36:22.266
No, I have a mom.

36:23.809 --> 36:24.852
I fucking hate her.

36:25.936 --> 36:27.104
When did you go to Vassar?

36:27.604 --> 36:29.273
2012 to 2016.

36:29.273 --> 36:32.192
- <i>You were there the whole time?</i>
- <i>No. Spent a year abroad.</i>

36:32.192 --> 36:34.027
- <i>Where?</i>
- <i>Florence, Italy.</i>

36:34.027 --> 36:35.529
<i>So you speak Italian?</i>

36:35.529 --> 36:38.031
And what did you think of Italy?

36:38.031 --> 36:40.033
I've got great memories.

36:40.033 --> 36:42.411
But, I had this boyfriend
who was a real jerk.

36:58.177 --> 36:59.219
I'm taking you out.

37:01.805 --> 37:02.806
Where?

37:05.058 --> 37:06.143
You like martinis?

37:09.188 --> 37:10.439
I like martinis.

37:12.733 --> 37:13.734
Good.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.225
<i>Cheers.</i>

38:32.479 --> 38:34.314
So, what exactly are we doing here?

38:36.108 --> 38:37.150
We're celebrating.

38:38.068 --> 38:39.444
What exactly are we celebrating?

38:41.613 --> 38:42.739
My birthday.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.285
It's your birthday?

38:50.873 --> 38:54.209
You've been doing really well.
Better than I expected.

38:55.335 --> 38:56.336
Thank you.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.465
You ready for a test run?

39:01.800 --> 39:03.886
- Test run?
- See that guy at the bar?

39:07.598 --> 39:08.765
Yeah. What about him?

39:11.351 --> 39:13.478
Get him to take you back to his room.

39:22.696 --> 39:24.072
Are you serious?

39:24.072 --> 39:25.616
Got 40 minutes.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.348
And here we were having such a nice time.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.667
- What can I get for you, miss?
- Vodka martini, please.

40:23.882 --> 40:24.716
How do you do?

40:27.803 --> 40:29.054
I'm good. Hi.

40:36.728 --> 40:37.604
Thank you.

40:42.150 --> 40:43.318
Can I buy you a drink?

40:45.863 --> 40:46.864
I hate drinking alone.

40:49.783 --> 40:51.285
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

40:53.287 --> 40:54.288
I'm Sandra.

40:55.539 --> 40:59.543
- I'm William.
- Nice to meet you, William.

41:00.502 --> 41:01.712
It's nice to meet you too.

41:16.268 --> 41:17.895
<i>I have a confession.</i>

41:17.895 --> 41:19.396
<i>Oh, yeah. What's that?</i>

41:19.396 --> 41:20.564
<i>Noticed you at the bar.</i>

41:21.732 --> 41:23.025
<i>I have a thing for older men.</i>

41:23.942 --> 41:25.611
<i>Wow. You got a thing, huh?</i>

41:25.611 --> 41:26.778
A bad thing.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.616
What's the matter?
Daddy didn't love you enough?

41:31.909 --> 41:33.118
Daddy wasn't around much.

41:43.462 --> 41:44.546
You're married, aren't you?

41:46.632 --> 41:48.717
Yeah,
that's what the ring on my finger says.

41:54.932 --> 41:58.268
I wanted to fuck you
since the second you walked in tonight.

42:00.437 --> 42:03.232
I'm going to tell you
what I'm gonna do to you, all night...

42:08.820 --> 42:10.822
- What's that?
- Just ignore it.

42:10.822 --> 42:12.491
It's just turndown service.

42:19.039 --> 42:22.334
- Hold on one second. Don't move.
- Yeah.

42:25.462 --> 42:27.798
Fucking bitch.
Don't you think I fucking knew it?

42:27.798 --> 42:29.007
I knew you were fucking him.

42:29.007 --> 42:31.677
- What are you doing here, huh?
- I'm calling the front desk.

42:31.677 --> 42:33.178
- I love you. Do you understand that?
- Jason!

42:33.178 --> 42:34.221
- Relax!
- Shut up!

42:34.221 --> 42:35.889
- Jason, calm down!
- Are you fucking him?

42:35.889 --> 42:38.183
Are you fucking my girl?
Did you fuck my fucking girl?

42:38.183 --> 42:40.185
- I'll fucking kill you!
- He didn't--

42:40.185 --> 42:42.062
Fucking God! Jesus Christ!

42:42.062 --> 42:43.105
- You fucking bitch!
- Jason, listen to me.

42:43.105 --> 42:44.481
- Hey!
- Fuck!

42:44.982 --> 42:47.234
- Jason, it is over.
- Get the fuck out of here!

42:47.234 --> 42:48.861
- I'm calling security.
- No, okay. Sit down.

42:49.361 --> 42:51.405
- Calm down.
- No, no. No, no, no. Look, he's harmless.

42:51.989 --> 42:54.366
- Do you want me to call security?
- No, no. I'm s--

42:54.366 --> 42:56.994
He's just an old boy--
He's an old boyfriend. I'm-I'm--

42:56.994 --> 42:59.204
He's just hurt. He's completely harmless.

42:59.204 --> 43:01.081
- Are you gonna be okay in here?
- I'm fine. Yeah.

43:01.081 --> 43:03.542
- I promise, just-- Completely.
- Are you sure?

43:03.542 --> 43:05.169
Can you just give us a few minutes?

43:06.211 --> 43:07.921
- Sure. Sure.
- Yeah. I'll-- I'll--

43:07.921 --> 43:10.215
Just-Just go down back to the bar...

43:10.215 --> 43:11.758
You're a fucking liar!

43:11.758 --> 43:13.552
...and I'll meet you in half an hour.

43:13.552 --> 43:14.761
- Okay? Yeah.
- Okay, fine.

43:14.761 --> 43:16.889
- You sure you're gonna be okay?
- Completely.

43:16.889 --> 43:18.682
- Goddamn it. Fine.
- He's calming down.

43:18.682 --> 43:21.685
- Yeah. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Got it. Okay.
- Just-- Keep it down, okay?

43:27.441 --> 43:28.483
Fuck.

43:33.322 --> 43:34.323
Well done.

43:36.074 --> 43:38.702
You figured it out.
You're a natural. Right?

43:38.702 --> 43:41.246
You were quick, you stayed cool.
You improvised. That's what we do.

43:41.246 --> 43:42.539
What the fuck?

43:46.168 --> 43:47.628
Shit.

43:53.217 --> 43:55.093
I'm surprised
people still walk around with cash.

43:59.681 --> 44:03.560
And of course.
Diamond earrings for the poor wife

44:04.102 --> 44:06.980
who sits at home and waits for her husband
while he preys on young women.

44:06.980 --> 44:09.441
I wouldn't say he was preying on me.
We sort of set him up.

44:09.441 --> 44:10.526
Don't do that.

44:11.485 --> 44:13.445
- What?
- Don't feel sorry for him.

44:19.117 --> 44:21.954
You can't cheat an honest man, right?

44:23.956 --> 44:25.999
That's why we never feel sorry
for the mark.

44:48.647 --> 44:49.773
They look good on you.

45:11.503 --> 45:12.671
What are you doing?

45:16.258 --> 45:17.801
Happy birthday, Max.

46:43.387 --> 46:45.973
<i>...against the wall</i>

46:45.973 --> 46:48.767
- <i>Like the drip, drip, drip</i>
- Thank you.

46:48.767 --> 46:51.144
<i>Of the raindrops</i>

46:51.144 --> 46:54.940
<i>When the summer shower is through</i>

46:54.940 --> 46:56.441
Enjoy the evening, sir.

46:56.441 --> 47:01.029
<i>A voice within me keeps repeating</i>

47:01.029 --> 47:04.491
<i>You, you, you</i>

47:04.491 --> 47:08.704
<i>Night and day</i>

47:09.454 --> 47:11.456
<i>You are the one</i>

47:14.376 --> 47:18.046
<i>Only you beneath the moon</i>

47:18.046 --> 47:20.382
<i>And under the sun...</i>

47:20.382 --> 47:22.342
Max. You made it.

47:22.843 --> 47:26.138
Richard, I want you to meet my son, Max.

47:26.138 --> 47:27.306
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

47:28.724 --> 47:30.684
- You look great.
- Heard so much about you.

47:32.603 --> 47:34.354
I wish I could say the same.

47:34.354 --> 47:37.691
Well, maybe if you returned a text
or actually picked up the phone

47:37.691 --> 47:39.735
and called your mother
every once in a while.

47:39.735 --> 47:41.445
I'm very busy, Mom. I'm sorry.

47:43.197 --> 47:45.365
Your mother tells me
you were in St. Barts.

47:45.365 --> 47:48.452
- Yeah, I was.
- Yeah. I had some fun times there myself.

47:49.578 --> 47:50.746
Back in the '70s.

47:52.789 --> 47:54.374
- You're old.
- Max.

47:54.374 --> 47:57.586
That's-- I'm--
Come-- Come with me, I wanna talk.

47:57.586 --> 47:59.213
- Come on. Come on with me. Yeah.
- Really?

47:59.213 --> 48:00.297
I'm so sorry.

48:00.297 --> 48:01.590
Come. Come on.

48:02.424 --> 48:03.467
Let's go.

48:04.051 --> 48:06.553
Excuse me, sir.

48:06.553 --> 48:08.555
- Hi.
- No, stop that. Come on.

48:08.555 --> 48:11.183
- You look great.
- Hey. What is the matter with you?

48:11.183 --> 48:12.601
- What?
- You are so rude.

48:14.102 --> 48:17.231
- What do you know about this guy?
- Honey, he's a public figure.

48:17.231 --> 48:20.234
Anything you wanna know,
you can just Google him.

48:21.568 --> 48:22.945
You can't be alone for two minutes.

48:22.945 --> 48:24.738
You throw yourself
into these relationships.

48:24.738 --> 48:26.865
This is different. It really is.

48:28.242 --> 48:29.201
Sure it is.

48:29.952 --> 48:31.995
Go easy on that, please.
I think you've had enough.

48:33.830 --> 48:35.207
Stop being my mom, Mom.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.377
Sweetheart, what is it?

48:39.211 --> 48:40.337
What's going on?

48:40.921 --> 48:43.215
I thought you were gonna bring
your girlfriend tonight.

48:43.215 --> 48:44.341
Where is she?

48:44.925 --> 48:46.051
Seeing somebody else.

48:46.552 --> 48:47.594
I see.

48:49.096 --> 48:50.097
I'm sorry.

48:51.515 --> 48:54.268
I never liked her.
I think she was a bad influence.

48:55.978 --> 48:57.396
Can I stay here for a little while?

48:58.856 --> 48:59.940
Okay.

49:03.735 --> 49:04.945
Are you using?

49:06.154 --> 49:10.576
No, I'm not using drugs.
I haven't done drugs in a year.

49:10.576 --> 49:12.828
It's just that I can't
go through that again,

49:12.828 --> 49:15.455
- and that can't happen here.
- Mom, I'm clean.

49:15.455 --> 49:16.832
My God. What the fuck is--

49:16.832 --> 49:19.251
What do you want?
You want me to prove it to you?

49:19.251 --> 49:20.377
A fucking piss test?

49:20.377 --> 49:23.005
- Is that what you want?
- Stop. What? What are you doing?

49:23.005 --> 49:26.133
- Here. I'll do it right now! Okay?
- No! No, don't. Stop! Stop!

49:26.133 --> 49:28.635
- You can see for yourself!
- Don't do that. Stop it right now!

49:33.390 --> 49:34.433
Prove it to you.

49:40.022 --> 49:40.939
Go ahead.

49:42.357 --> 49:44.985
- Test it.
- Please don't do this to me.

49:44.985 --> 49:46.069
Test it!

49:47.321 --> 49:51.325
Please. Please. Please.
Please, don't do this to me.

50:02.628 --> 50:03.962
Mom, I'm sorry.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.469
I'm sorry, Mom.

50:10.469 --> 50:14.765
Why do you do this?
Why do you do this to me?

50:15.474 --> 50:17.267
I'm really sorry.

50:19.853 --> 50:23.941
Just-- I still need a place to stay, okay?

50:26.735 --> 50:27.778
Please?

50:27.778 --> 50:30.364
You can stay.
Just not for very long, okay?

50:33.784 --> 50:36.161
Thank you. I love you.

50:38.956 --> 50:39.873
Thank you.

50:50.509 --> 50:51.593
You enjoy the show?

51:07.067 --> 51:09.486
I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

51:09.486 --> 51:12.781
I'm-- I'm so-- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

51:29.548 --> 51:32.134
He spent the last year
putting together a company

51:32.134 --> 51:34.803
to charter boats in the Bahamas,

51:34.803 --> 51:39.266
but then the hurricane wiped that out,
which is too bad because he was so happy.

51:39.266 --> 51:42.186
- He was doing so well--
- Madeline. How does he live?

51:42.186 --> 51:44.313
Well, his father left him some money,
and--

51:46.690 --> 51:48.192
I help him out from time to time.

51:49.860 --> 51:50.861
Of course you do.

51:51.737 --> 51:54.406
I was so young when he was born, you know?

51:54.406 --> 51:58.160
And then his father died,
and I'm suddenly a widow,

51:58.160 --> 52:01.371
and I didn't always know
how to be a mother.

52:01.371 --> 52:04.041
It's up to him to do better.
He-He's an adult.

52:04.041 --> 52:05.959
No, he isn't. And that's my fault.

52:07.044 --> 52:09.880
He's always been my little Max.
And he can't swim without me.

52:11.131 --> 52:12.132
Morning, Mom.

52:13.550 --> 52:16.637
Hi, sweetheart. How'd you sleep?

52:17.721 --> 52:20.974
Great. Room's got an amazing view.

52:22.643 --> 52:23.644
Good.

52:24.811 --> 52:28.148
Well, I--
I actually have an appointment downtown,

52:28.148 --> 52:31.902
but I was thinking if you were free
that maybe we could have lunch together.

52:33.070 --> 52:34.988
At one o'clock. Via Carota?

52:35.656 --> 52:37.783
- Sounds great.
- Okay. Perfect.

52:40.035 --> 52:40.953
See you later.

52:47.960 --> 52:48.961
Bye, honey.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.558
Richard?

53:06.562 --> 53:08.146
I'm sorry about yesterday.

53:08.146 --> 53:12.693
I took a Klonopin,
and I had a lot of drinks.

53:13.944 --> 53:16.989
Max, we're gonna be in each other's lives

53:16.989 --> 53:18.657
for the foreseeable future.

53:19.366 --> 53:21.201
Let's make the best of it, shall we?

53:22.536 --> 53:25.539
You know, your mother and I are attending

53:25.539 --> 53:29.459
a benefit tonight
for the Richard Hobbes Foundation.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.879
My late wife founded it.

53:31.879 --> 53:35.507
We make all sorts
of charitable contributions.

53:36.925 --> 53:38.844
Did you want me to make a donation?

53:38.844 --> 53:40.804
Because, honestly,
I'm a little light right now.

53:40.804 --> 53:44.141
No. No, I figured you might wanna join us.

53:44.933 --> 53:48.979
There's a gonna be a--
a few very hip musical acts.

53:48.979 --> 53:51.231
They tell me they're quite relevant.

53:54.443 --> 53:56.320
<i>There's gonna be
a lot of young people your age.</i>

53:57.946 --> 53:58.947
<i>Lot of young women.</i>

54:00.949 --> 54:04.912
Thank you, but I think
I should just stay in and rest.

54:07.372 --> 54:09.875
Yeah. Fair enough.

54:32.814 --> 54:35.943
Well, you were terrible.
You treated him like a waiter.

54:35.943 --> 54:38.946
I still have no idea who he is.

54:38.946 --> 54:43.408
No, he's-- he's on that TV show.
He plays a spy. He's very famous.

54:43.992 --> 54:46.787
All night, all I could think about
was being alone with you.

54:46.787 --> 54:48.038
You're alone with me now.

54:54.169 --> 54:57.798
I don't care about actors.
You should know that.

55:00.175 --> 55:02.261
I just want you all to myself.

55:08.141 --> 55:09.560
- Sir, calm down.
- I asked you to identify...

55:09.560 --> 55:11.144
Sir, the police are here.

55:12.020 --> 55:15.440
- Police? Hey! What's going on here?
- Fuck does that even fucking mean?

55:15.440 --> 55:17.651
- Sir, excuse me. I'm NYPD.
- Oh, my G--

55:17.651 --> 55:19.528
Detective Collins.
Does this young man live here?

55:19.528 --> 55:21.572
- Well, he's staying here.
- I don't fucking live here.

55:21.572 --> 55:24.491
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I didn't do anything.

55:24.491 --> 55:25.993
He solicited drugs
from an undercover officer.

55:25.993 --> 55:28.203
You came up to me
and tried to sell me fucking cocaine.

55:28.203 --> 55:29.913
- And you said yes.
- Don't put words in my mouth.

55:29.913 --> 55:32.082
- Detective, how bad is this?
- It's not looking good.

55:32.958 --> 55:33.876
He has a few offenses.

55:33.876 --> 55:36.295
We ran his name,
and he's looking at doing some time.

55:36.295 --> 55:37.963
- Oh, my God. Max.
- Wha-- What happens now?

55:37.963 --> 55:40.549
- I'll take him downtown--
- Fuck that, dude. I'm outta here.

55:40.549 --> 55:41.884
Get your fucking hands off of me!

55:41.884 --> 55:44.678
Richard!
Richard, please. Stop him. Stop him!

55:44.678 --> 55:45.846
Calm down!

55:45.846 --> 55:48.682
- Fuck!
- Detective, can we talk about this?

55:50.517 --> 55:51.810
- Fuck.
- Now?

55:58.025 --> 56:01.028
I make large donations
to the NYPD every year.

56:01.028 --> 56:02.404
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

56:02.404 --> 56:04.740
That's the reason for the courtesy call.
It's why I'm here.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.867
I know the commissioner.
Marty is a good friend.

56:06.867 --> 56:10.037
- I can put in a good word for you.
- Richard, you don't have to do that.

56:10.037 --> 56:12.247
My word carries weight in this city.

56:15.250 --> 56:16.668
That can cut both ways.

56:16.668 --> 56:19.755
I really appreciate what you've done,
coming here.

56:19.755 --> 56:20.881
I don't know, sir.

56:20.881 --> 56:22.382
I'm gonna pay you for your time.

56:23.383 --> 56:25.802
I-- I can't do that. No, I'm-- I'm sorry.

56:26.345 --> 56:28.180
Take the fucking money, Detective.

56:33.644 --> 56:36.063
- Stop. He's not a cop.
- What?

56:36.063 --> 56:37.523
- Ma'am, ex--
- Shut up.

56:39.566 --> 56:41.777
This is-- This is what Max does.

56:41.777 --> 56:44.404
He plays these--
these little confidence games.

56:45.697 --> 56:49.201
That's what this is, isn't it? This is--
This is one of your games, right?

56:50.160 --> 56:51.912
- I can assure you that I'm--
- You get out.

56:51.912 --> 56:55.123
Get out or I really will call the police.
I mean it. Get out of here.

57:02.881 --> 57:04.258
Tipsy, I mean, I think--

57:04.258 --> 57:05.926
- Dude, fuck.
- You better-- You better go.

57:05.926 --> 57:07.928
- Do you think this is funny?
- Why'd you fucking break?

57:07.928 --> 57:09.346
Do you think this is funny?

57:09.346 --> 57:10.639
Come on, man.

57:11.431 --> 57:13.267
- You okay?
- Get out of here. Get out of here.

57:13.267 --> 57:15.102
- Okay.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

57:15.102 --> 57:17.104
- I'll call you later. Thank you.
- All right, dude.

57:17.855 --> 57:19.022
Hope I catch you later, bro.

57:19.857 --> 57:21.024
Oh, my God.

57:21.024 --> 57:22.401
Mom, listen.

57:24.611 --> 57:25.904
I gave you everything, you know.

57:25.904 --> 57:28.448
You-- You had every advantage.

57:28.949 --> 57:31.118
You-- You didn't--
You didn't want for anything,

57:31.118 --> 57:32.786
and this is what you do to me?

57:33.370 --> 57:35.581
- You humiliate me in front of him?
- It's just a little--

57:43.714 --> 57:44.798
I want you to leave.

57:48.802 --> 57:50.345
I don't want you here anymore.

58:01.899 --> 58:07.321
All that work for $1,000.

58:07.946 --> 58:10.032
Let me give you a piece of advice, Max.

58:11.200 --> 58:14.244
If you're gonna steal, steal a lot.

58:44.358 --> 58:45.526
I'm sorry I hit you.

58:47.069 --> 58:48.070
Forget it.

58:48.654 --> 58:50.739
No, I took it too far.

58:53.367 --> 58:54.368
Let me see.

59:09.758 --> 59:11.260
Is it too early for a drink?

59:21.478 --> 59:23.188
I don't like the way you look at him.

59:23.188 --> 59:24.314
Come on.

59:28.026 --> 59:29.069
You like him a little bit.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.697
Of course I like him. He's a billionaire.

59:33.073 --> 59:34.491
That's not what I'm talking about.

59:35.492 --> 59:37.828
Look, I feel really good about this.

59:37.828 --> 59:39.371
We're very close.

59:40.330 --> 59:42.791
He wants to meet with you
at his office at one o'clock.

59:49.047 --> 59:52.342
Well, maybe I don't wanna do this anymore.

59:52.342 --> 59:55.053
Why not? Don't be jealous.

59:58.765 --> 1:00:00.475
You know I don't like old men.

1:00:04.605 --> 1:00:05.981
You know what I like.

1:00:13.906 --> 1:00:14.990
Okay.

1:00:17.868 --> 1:00:18.702
No.

1:00:22.623 --> 1:00:23.665
Tell me what I like.

1:00:28.837 --> 1:00:29.880
You like me.

1:00:33.592 --> 1:00:34.593
I like you.

1:00:41.016 --> 1:00:42.267
Why do I like you?

1:00:44.144 --> 1:00:46.355
Because I get you what you want.

1:00:52.611 --> 1:00:53.904
So, get me what I want.

1:00:56.949 --> 1:00:58.283
Get me what I want.

1:00:58.825 --> 1:00:59.910
Okay.

1:01:42.244 --> 1:01:43.954
Max, thanks for coming.

1:01:44.705 --> 1:01:48.000
Hey. Are you okay?

1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:51.211
Yeah, it's just maintenance.
Here, follow me.

1:01:51.712 --> 1:01:54.631
I wanted to apologize about last night.

1:01:54.631 --> 1:01:55.966
It was inappropriate.

1:01:57.050 --> 1:01:58.719
That's a hell of an understatement.

1:01:59.928 --> 1:02:02.639
You know,
when your mother first told me about you,

1:02:03.182 --> 1:02:07.311
she said that you were well-educated,
smart, clever.

1:02:07.895 --> 1:02:12.482
I thought, you know, I'm always
on the lookout for a young man like that.

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:15.360
- Are you offering me a job here?
- No. I doubt if you'd want one.

1:02:17.738 --> 1:02:19.156
What are you doing here?

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:21.366
Did you schedule a meeting?

1:02:21.366 --> 1:02:23.160
No. I didn't know that I needed one.

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:24.244
What is it, Tom?

1:02:25.704 --> 1:02:26.538
I'm back.

1:02:26.538 --> 1:02:29.374
Yeah, I can see that. So, what is it?

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:31.877
Just wanted to say hi,
see how you're feeling...

1:02:31.877 --> 1:02:34.755
- Now is not a good time.
- All right, cool. See you around, Dad.

1:02:36.590 --> 1:02:37.591
Tom.

1:02:42.721 --> 1:02:43.722
Come on, in here.

1:02:44.890 --> 1:02:45.974
That was my son.

1:02:46.517 --> 1:02:49.311
I always assumed
he would inherit all this.

1:02:50.521 --> 1:02:53.315
Then his mother died
and he didn't take it well.

1:02:53.941 --> 1:02:56.735
He doesn't have the fortitude
to work here. He's weak.

1:02:59.321 --> 1:03:04.785
When he turned 21,
I offered him anything he wanted.

1:03:05.911 --> 1:03:08.497
You know what my son asked for?

1:03:09.790 --> 1:03:10.832
I don't know, Richard.

1:03:11.333 --> 1:03:16.129
A signed copy of Charlotte Brontë's
<i>Jane Eyre.</i>

1:03:16.964 --> 1:03:19.132
Now he wants to open a bookstore.

1:03:20.092 --> 1:03:21.802
Not exactly a sound investment.

1:03:22.678 --> 1:03:25.222
No. But I'm gonna give it to him anyway.

1:03:27.307 --> 1:03:28.475
You know why, Max?

1:03:30.644 --> 1:03:32.271
Because we only get one life.

1:03:32.271 --> 1:03:37.025
And I will not be my son's jailer
for his brief time on earth.

1:03:43.282 --> 1:03:45.659
I want you to be honest with yourself, Max.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:51.415
If I were to hire you to work for me,
how do you think it would end?

1:03:52.916 --> 1:03:54.042
Not well.

1:03:55.085 --> 1:03:56.128
I agree.

1:03:58.297 --> 1:04:03.594
Still, I want to offer you a job.
I'm thinking $60,000 a month.

1:04:03.594 --> 1:04:06.221
Sixty grand a month? For what?

1:04:06.722 --> 1:04:11.185
To go out and find opportunity.
Make a mark for yourself.

1:04:12.019 --> 1:04:13.228
You want me gone.

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:19.568
You cause your mother anguish, Max.
And I will not have it.

1:04:21.361 --> 1:04:23.280
So, what am I then? A bad investment?

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:25.365
I didn't get where I am
making bad investments.

1:04:25.365 --> 1:04:29.244
Is that what I'm worth, Richard?
Sixty thousand dollars a month?

1:04:29.244 --> 1:04:31.580
I'm offering you an opportunity.

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:35.709
I want a year's salary up-front.

1:04:37.044 --> 1:04:39.838
That can be arranged.
I'll just transfer the money in--

1:04:39.838 --> 1:04:42.633
Transfer the money?
No. What? So I can pay taxes?

1:04:42.633 --> 1:04:43.926
Hire an accountant? No.

1:04:45.135 --> 1:04:46.678
I want cash up-front.

1:04:50.933 --> 1:04:54.061
Get me the cash
and you get my mom all to yourself.

1:04:54.061 --> 1:04:57.606
I'll be gone. You won't even hear from me.
Not even a fucking postcard.

1:05:02.694 --> 1:05:03.779
Wait here.

1:06:57.518 --> 1:07:00.687
- We did it.
- We did it, baby.

1:07:06.193 --> 1:07:07.653
Where the fuck is my money?

1:07:10.906 --> 1:07:11.865
Y'all look good.

1:07:17.704 --> 1:07:18.789
Let's go.

1:07:23.627 --> 1:07:26.588
- Yeah!
- Let's do it.

1:07:28.215 --> 1:07:29.216
Here we go.

1:07:29.842 --> 1:07:31.426
We got the big Gs, buddy.

1:07:32.761 --> 1:07:35.055
Yo, wait, look.

1:07:35.055 --> 1:07:37.558
There is this new guy named Goldie.

1:07:37.558 --> 1:07:39.226
- He from, like, LA.
- Yeah.

1:07:39.226 --> 1:07:41.603
He started out working as a stuntman
before he was grifting,

1:07:41.603 --> 1:07:42.855
or whatever the fuck we doing.

1:07:42.855 --> 1:07:45.023
He started working as a stuntman. Crazy.

1:07:45.023 --> 1:07:47.401
He comes highly recommended
and he's looking for a score.

1:07:47.401 --> 1:07:48.485
And I need y'all.

1:07:49.570 --> 1:07:50.487
Tipsy...

1:07:53.156 --> 1:07:54.157
We're out.

1:07:55.242 --> 1:07:57.452
Come on, man.
What you-- What, y'all retiring?

1:07:57.452 --> 1:07:59.663
- No. No, no, no. No.
- That's it?

1:07:59.663 --> 1:08:01.456
What y'all gonna do?
Do the whole-- Come on.

1:08:01.456 --> 1:08:02.583
No, we're taking--

1:08:02.583 --> 1:08:05.502
- We're just gonna take a vacation.
- We're-- We're-- Yeah.

1:08:05.502 --> 1:08:07.671
- Taking a vacation.
- Okay. Well, y'all let me know

1:08:07.671 --> 1:08:09.590
- whenever y'all get back. Okay?
- Okay.

1:08:09.590 --> 1:08:11.049
Y'all gonna wanna meet him.

1:08:11.049 --> 1:08:12.134
Big shit, all right?

1:08:17.598 --> 1:08:18.599
Hey.

1:08:19.892 --> 1:08:21.560
You're bullshitting me. Where my money at?

1:08:26.857 --> 1:08:27.733
Come on.

1:08:27.733 --> 1:08:28.649
What?

1:08:30.694 --> 1:08:34.406
- That's it. Tipsy, that's it.
- No.

1:08:35.698 --> 1:08:37.158
We had expenses...

1:08:37.158 --> 1:08:39.661
- We handled some expenses.
- ...that we didn't account for.

1:08:39.661 --> 1:08:43.665
Yeah, okay, but this-- No. No, no.
This isn't what we agreed on, man.

1:08:43.665 --> 1:08:46.376
- I know, but things change.
- Yeah.

1:08:50.005 --> 1:08:53.091
This is becoming a habit with y'all two.
I'm starting to feel like I'm the mark.

1:08:53.716 --> 1:08:55.886
- Now we're laughing about it.
- No. Come on, man. No.

1:08:55.886 --> 1:08:56.803
- No, no, no.
- Uh-uh.

1:08:56.803 --> 1:08:57.888
Absolutely not.

1:09:02.935 --> 1:09:04.728
It was a beautiful con though, right?

1:09:04.728 --> 1:09:06.854
You can thank Madeline--
Madeline for that.

1:09:07.481 --> 1:09:08.857
Stop it. Stop it.

1:09:09.358 --> 1:09:11.276
Thank you, Madeline.

1:09:11.276 --> 1:09:13.278
You're welcome, Tipsy. You're welcome.

1:09:13.278 --> 1:09:15.738
- Thank you, Tipsy.
- Yeah. Thank you for everything, man.

1:09:15.738 --> 1:09:18.158
- I'll ca-- I'll call you.
- Yeah. For sure.

1:09:18.158 --> 1:09:19.993
- Y'all stay warm, all right?
- Bye.

1:09:23.997 --> 1:09:26.917
- Three quarters of a million.
- Not bad.

1:09:33.465 --> 1:09:34.466
Now what?

1:09:35.175 --> 1:09:38.386
I'm gonna go home. I'm gonna get my stuff.

1:09:38.386 --> 1:09:43.225
And I'm gonna tell him
that I have a sick aunt in Jersey.

1:09:43.225 --> 1:09:45.853
And I'm out first thing in the morning.

1:09:47.854 --> 1:09:49.064
You love me?

1:09:51.399 --> 1:09:52.609
Unfortunately.

1:10:19.094 --> 1:10:20.095
Hey.

1:10:20.095 --> 1:10:23.974
<i>Hey. So...</i>

1:10:23.974 --> 1:10:26.768
I have some good news and some bad news.

1:10:27.352 --> 1:10:30.480
<i>The good news is the money is all yours.</i>

1:10:31.523 --> 1:10:33.275
Okay. What's the bad news?

1:10:38.739 --> 1:10:41.992
The bad news is you were right.

1:10:42.784 --> 1:10:43.785
<i>Right about what?</i>

1:10:47.372 --> 1:10:48.749
The old man loves me.

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:53.086
<i>He wants to marry me, so I'm staying.</i>

1:10:53.086 --> 1:10:54.421
What are you talking about?

1:10:55.756 --> 1:10:58.425
<i>Maybe I don't wanna
sit around in a bar all day</i>

1:10:58.425 --> 1:11:00.427
pulling short cons
for the rest of my life.

1:11:00.969 --> 1:11:02.346
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:05.140
Sooner or later the old man
is gonna ask questions.

1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:07.518
<i>No. No, he won't. He's too invested.</i>

1:11:08.018 --> 1:11:10.562
He's got too much on his mind.

1:11:10.562 --> 1:11:12.356
You know, his health and his business.

1:11:12.356 --> 1:11:14.858
And that-- that emotional wreck of a son.

1:11:16.443 --> 1:11:18.904
But I'm the good thing, right?

1:11:19.613 --> 1:11:21.365
<i>I'm the good thing he's got.</i>

1:11:21.365 --> 1:11:22.366
Yeah.

1:11:22.366 --> 1:11:24.785
I know you. You stay, you'll slip.

1:11:25.619 --> 1:11:28.956
No, I won't. I'm too good.

1:11:30.749 --> 1:11:34.711
And if they're not looking for you,
they don't see you.

1:11:36.713 --> 1:11:37.965
<i>Are you really doing this?</i>

1:11:43.804 --> 1:11:44.680
Yeah.

1:11:46.181 --> 1:11:48.016
I don't wanna play the mom anymore.

1:11:50.018 --> 1:11:51.019
It's boring.

1:11:56.066 --> 1:11:57.818
Max Burnett, it's the police.

1:11:57.818 --> 1:12:00.821
We have an outstanding warrant
for your arrest. Open the door.

1:12:00.821 --> 1:12:03.115
I don't believe you. Who's at the door?
Tipsy?

1:12:06.326 --> 1:12:07.578
You better go.

1:12:09.496 --> 1:12:10.789
You're bluffing.

1:12:10.789 --> 1:12:13.625
Yeah, well, then call my bluff
and open the door.

1:12:16.253 --> 1:12:17.254
Open the door.

1:12:19.214 --> 1:12:20.299
So, you used me?

1:12:26.889 --> 1:12:27.890
Max Burnett.

1:12:32.519 --> 1:12:33.979
- Fuck.
- Open the door.

1:13:55.936 --> 1:13:57.020
I'm so sorry.

1:13:57.020 --> 1:14:00.107
<i>I'm gonna need a minute
of your time to go over Richard's will.</i>

1:14:00.107 --> 1:14:02.609
<i>There are documents
that are time-sensitive.</i>

1:14:03.110 --> 1:14:07.155
And also, I think it's best
we do it right away, for Tom's sake.

1:14:08.198 --> 1:14:10.200
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:14:17.583 --> 1:14:20.752
<i>Richard dictated this last draft
of the will to me personally,</i>

1:14:20.752 --> 1:14:21.962
<i>and then he signed it.</i>

1:14:22.504 --> 1:14:24.840
And because he was at the height
of his sickness,

1:14:25.549 --> 1:14:27.718
I feel it's my obligation to assure you

1:14:27.718 --> 1:14:31.305
that he was cogent and of sound mind
when he did so.

1:14:33.098 --> 1:14:36.435
Richard left the bulk of his estate
to Madeline.

1:14:40.147 --> 1:14:42.691
That's ridiculous, this--
It should be Tom's.

1:14:42.691 --> 1:14:47.362
Richard was very clear.
After the past incident with Tom...

1:14:47.362 --> 1:14:51.950
- I had $350,000 stolen from me.
- He had major misgivings...

1:14:51.950 --> 1:14:54.578
- And I had a nervous breakdown.
- ...leaving Tom both the business

1:14:54.578 --> 1:14:55.954
and the estate.

1:14:58.874 --> 1:15:01.376
You'll be taken care of through a trust.

1:15:02.002 --> 1:15:03.003
It's generous.

1:15:03.921 --> 1:15:06.507
And it will allow you
to hold on to your bookstore.

1:15:07.090 --> 1:15:10.093
Tom will also
retain control of the charity,

1:15:10.093 --> 1:15:12.179
the Richard Hobbes Foundation.

1:15:12.179 --> 1:15:15.682
As for everything else,
property, assets, shares, stocks,

1:15:17.142 --> 1:15:19.061
the remaining 9.2 billion...

1:15:20.854 --> 1:15:22.022
It will all go to Madeline.

1:15:24.441 --> 1:15:27.277
Well, at least
he trusted me with the Foundation.

1:15:27.277 --> 1:15:30.405
He did, Tom. You're chairman of the board.

1:15:32.658 --> 1:15:35.160
And Madeline has been named trustee.

1:15:37.454 --> 1:15:38.747
I'm a trustee?

1:15:38.747 --> 1:15:40.374
It's only a formality.

1:15:40.374 --> 1:15:44.211
A piece of insurance in the event
Tom is unable to fulfill his duties

1:15:44.211 --> 1:15:47.089
- and Madeline will--
- Will take over. Yeah, I get it.

1:15:50.551 --> 1:15:53.762
He trusted you
with control of the Foundation.

1:15:53.762 --> 1:15:56.139
I can tell you that
with complete sincerity.

1:15:59.226 --> 1:16:00.936
- He thought the world of you.
- Yeah, okay.

1:16:00.936 --> 1:16:03.856
No offense, but my father's last wishes
tell me exactly what he thought of me.

1:16:05.190 --> 1:16:08.735
David, I'd like to be alone
with Tom for a minute,

1:16:08.735 --> 1:16:10.404
- if that's okay.
- Of course. Of course.

1:16:11.321 --> 1:16:12.948
Thank you. Thank you.

1:16:16.034 --> 1:16:17.327
I am so sorry.

1:16:17.327 --> 1:16:19.496
- Don't be. It's not your fault.
- No, I just--

1:16:19.496 --> 1:16:21.540
I want you to know that I'm your partner.

1:16:22.541 --> 1:16:23.792
And that I'm here for you.

1:16:25.169 --> 1:16:29.131
I'm here for whatever you need.
You don't have to go through this alone.

1:16:29.131 --> 1:16:30.674
Thank you for saying that.

1:16:30.674 --> 1:16:32.759
You can stay with me
for as long as you like.

1:16:32.759 --> 1:16:34.803
You don't have to move out anytime soon.

1:16:36.555 --> 1:16:39.474
But I'm gonna have to sell this apartment
because I can't do it.

1:16:40.517 --> 1:16:44.229
I can't-- I can't stay here alone.
I just can't.

1:16:45.230 --> 1:16:46.315
I can't manage it.

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:50.110
- I don't know why I brought this up.
- Okay.

1:16:50.110 --> 1:16:51.195
I shouldn't-- I shouldn't--

1:16:51.195 --> 1:16:53.030
- No, I get it.
- I shouldn't have brought it up right now.

1:16:53.030 --> 1:16:55.240
We can discuss it some other time.

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:56.992
- I think it's just a lot.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1:16:56.992 --> 1:16:59.286
It's a lot for both of us
to handle right now.

1:17:27.689 --> 1:17:30.025
- Thank you, Patrick.
- You're welcome, Miss Hobbes.

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:35.781
- Good morning, Charlie.
- How are you, Miss Hobbes?

1:17:53.507 --> 1:17:55.342
I'm gonna check on the room.
I'll be right back.

1:17:55.342 --> 1:17:56.510
Thank you so much.

1:17:58.178 --> 1:17:59.096
...Mrs. Hobbes.

1:18:00.055 --> 1:18:01.014
Wow.

1:18:05.435 --> 1:18:08.480
This is so pretty.
May I see the other tray?

1:18:09.189 --> 1:18:10.190
Yes, of course.

1:18:28.750 --> 1:18:30.836
I have to tell you something.
I think I saw...

1:18:39.553 --> 1:18:41.847
Please, come this way.
Tom is expecting you.

1:18:46.268 --> 1:18:49.146
He's gonna be bored out of his mind.
Come talk to me in 20 years.

1:18:49.146 --> 1:18:51.982
I'll be dealing with the exact same thing.
You know what I'm saying?

1:18:52.649 --> 1:18:55.152
Mrs. Hobbes. Good morning.
I'm Pat Braddock.

1:18:55.152 --> 1:18:57.404
We met briefly
at your husband's memorial service.

1:18:58.655 --> 1:19:00.240
Yes, of course. How do you do?

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:01.742
I'm good. Thank you.

1:19:01.742 --> 1:19:04.870
These are my associates,
Mr. McCabe, Mr. Mosely.

1:19:06.246 --> 1:19:08.582
We're here to see Tom.
We're doing a bit of business for him.

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.084
What kind of business?

1:19:11.084 --> 1:19:12.753
Pat, hey.

1:19:13.420 --> 1:19:14.254
It's okay, Madeline.

1:19:14.254 --> 1:19:15.881
- Braddock is an old family friend.
- Hi, Tom.

1:19:15.881 --> 1:19:17.758
Good to see you. He did work for my father

1:19:17.758 --> 1:19:20.385
whenever he had anything sensitive
he needed taken care of.

1:19:20.928 --> 1:19:23.096
Actually, Madeline,
I want you to see this.

1:19:23.764 --> 1:19:26.850
Tom enlisted our help to find
the young woman who committed the theft.

1:19:26.850 --> 1:19:28.685
After running her picture
through the system,

1:19:28.685 --> 1:19:31.563
we landed on this woman.
We think this is her.

1:19:35.484 --> 1:19:36.527
- That's her.
- All right.

1:19:36.527 --> 1:19:37.861
So her name is Sandra Carmichael.

1:19:37.861 --> 1:19:40.364
She was born in Seattle. Rough childhood.

1:19:40.864 --> 1:19:43.700
Talked to the mother, but she
hasn't spoken to her in several years.

1:19:43.700 --> 1:19:46.203
Okay, she drops out of high school at 16,

1:19:46.203 --> 1:19:48.205
starts racking up a number of offenses.

1:19:48.205 --> 1:19:50.666
Shoplifting, possession, assault.

1:19:51.166 --> 1:19:52.501
But then she develops a habit,

1:19:52.501 --> 1:19:55.754
and she crisscrosses the country
until she makes her way to Queens,

1:19:55.754 --> 1:19:57.714
where she's arrested again for possession.

1:19:57.714 --> 1:20:00.634
She gets paroled
and that's where the trail runs cold.

1:20:01.635 --> 1:20:04.137
Okay, so that's it. She's a drug addict.

1:20:04.137 --> 1:20:06.640
Well, frankly, it raises some questions.

1:20:07.182 --> 1:20:08.767
- What kind of questions?
- Yeah, like what?

1:20:08.767 --> 1:20:11.061
What she pulled
required a great deal of sophistication.

1:20:11.061 --> 1:20:13.105
I don't see how this woman did it alone.

1:20:13.105 --> 1:20:15.023
I think we're looking
for more than one person.

1:20:16.441 --> 1:20:18.902
- We'll keep you posted.
- Thank you. I really appreciate this.

1:20:18.902 --> 1:20:21.697
- We're gonna get 'em.
- Okay. No, I trust you.

1:20:23.156 --> 1:20:25.826
- We'll talk to you soon, all right?
- Okay. Yeah.

1:21:11.079 --> 1:21:12.080
Hi!

1:21:13.624 --> 1:21:14.750
Hi!

1:21:18.170 --> 1:21:21.173
- I didn't know you could cook.
- Not bad for a trophy wife, huh?

1:21:23.550 --> 1:21:25.385
I mean, your dad told me
what you said about me.

1:21:25.385 --> 1:21:28.805
- Sorry. I didn't know you then.
- I don't care.

1:21:28.805 --> 1:21:31.141
- It was more about him.
- I honestly-- I really don't care.

1:21:32.059 --> 1:21:33.268
You hungry?

1:21:33.894 --> 1:21:36.313
Yeah. I could eat.
Let me just put my stuff down.

1:21:41.235 --> 1:21:43.403
<i>Did you have any luck finding that girl?</i>

1:21:43.403 --> 1:21:47.157
Not yet. Braddock had a lead
down in Miami but it was a bust.

1:21:48.909 --> 1:21:49.785
Honey, you know,

1:21:49.785 --> 1:21:55.165
what these people did to you was awful
and confusing and unfair.

1:21:55.165 --> 1:22:00.003
But I don't think that finding her
is gonna make you feel any better.

1:22:01.421 --> 1:22:02.422
I disagree.

1:22:03.298 --> 1:22:04.424
Yeah, well--

1:22:05.008 --> 1:22:07.928
Okay. Hang on, I-- I have
something I wanna show you.

1:22:07.928 --> 1:22:09.054
So, I...

1:22:10.806 --> 1:22:14.226
started looking for apartments for you.

1:22:14.226 --> 1:22:16.395
These are all downtown near the bookstore,

1:22:16.395 --> 1:22:18.564
so it wouldn't be much of a commute.

1:22:18.564 --> 1:22:20.107
- What is this?
- Well, I told you.

1:22:20.107 --> 1:22:22.693
I'm gonna have to sell this apartment,
so I want you to find a place.

1:22:22.693 --> 1:22:24.528
I know, but I don't need you
to do this for me.

1:22:24.528 --> 1:22:25.779
But I want to, sweetheart.

1:22:25.779 --> 1:22:28.365
- I wanna help you with this.
- I get that. I'm just saying that

1:22:28.365 --> 1:22:30.993
- I can find my own apartment. Thank you.
- Why are you getting upset?

1:22:30.993 --> 1:22:32.244
- I'm not.
- No, you are.

1:22:32.244 --> 1:22:34.037
- No, I'm not. I'm just--
- You totally are getting upset.

1:22:34.037 --> 1:22:36.290
- You can't come here and do this...
- No, but I want to.

1:22:36.290 --> 1:22:37.666
- ...and expect me not to react.
- I wanna be a part of this.

1:22:37.666 --> 1:22:41.211
- It's not your problem. You're not my mom!
- No, you're right. I'm not.

1:22:41.211 --> 1:22:43.547
'Cause if I were, I'd tell you
to grow the fuck up.

1:22:48.468 --> 1:22:51.263
People get their hearts broken every day.

1:22:51.263 --> 1:22:53.473
It happens to everybody, okay?

1:22:55.309 --> 1:22:56.310
All the time.

1:22:58.103 --> 1:23:02.149
But most kids aren't entitled enough
to hire men to find the girl who did it.

1:23:02.149 --> 1:23:03.317
She stole money from me.

1:23:03.317 --> 1:23:05.819
That's not why you're doing it.
You want to see her again.

1:23:06.737 --> 1:23:07.738
Right?

1:23:10.908 --> 1:23:13.035
You can lie to yourself,
but you can't lie to me.

1:23:20.209 --> 1:23:21.919
I'm sorry. That was harsh.

1:23:21.919 --> 1:23:23.545
- You think I'm a loser.
- No, I don't.

1:23:23.545 --> 1:23:25.464
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't think that you're a loser.

1:23:25.464 --> 1:23:26.632
I think that...

1:23:29.468 --> 1:23:30.802
I think that you're human.

1:23:33.096 --> 1:23:36.475
I think we're all human.

1:23:36.475 --> 1:23:38.101
We're just doing the best we can.

1:23:43.565 --> 1:23:45.150
I'll have Braddock call it off.

1:23:48.946 --> 1:23:52.074
Good for you, sweetheart.
I know it's hard.

1:23:55.369 --> 1:23:58.413
<i>This apartment is unlisted.
You're the first people to see it.</i>

1:23:58.413 --> 1:23:59.456
That's exciting.

1:24:00.123 --> 1:24:01.458
- This is a great neighborhood.
- Hello?

1:24:01.458 --> 1:24:03.252
- There are lots of young people here.
- Yeah?

1:24:03.252 --> 1:24:04.503
Well, Tom has a bookstore

1:24:04.503 --> 1:24:06.004
- on Thompson Street...
- Yeah. Okay.

1:24:06.004 --> 1:24:08.382
- ...so this may be absolutely perfect.
- Bring her to the apartment. Yeah.

1:24:08.382 --> 1:24:10.843
- Honey, what-- what's going on?
- Okay. Thanks.

1:24:11.468 --> 1:24:12.427
They found her.

1:24:12.886 --> 1:24:15.264
I thought you told them
to stop looking for her?

1:24:15.264 --> 1:24:18.809
Well, I did-- I did. But they had
one last lead and they found her.

1:24:19.434 --> 1:24:21.395
- Where is she?
- They're bringing her to the apartment.

1:24:21.395 --> 1:24:23.605
I just wanna talk to her. I have to go.
I'm sorry.

1:24:23.605 --> 1:24:26.608
I'm so sorry. We're gonna have to
do this another time. Thank you so much.

1:24:28.026 --> 1:24:29.695
- We've got her in the guest room.
- Okay.

1:24:29.695 --> 1:24:33.866
She was living in the Lincoln Motel
off the Cross Bronx Expressway.

1:24:34.616 --> 1:24:39.204
And she has a serious heroin addiction.
She's fallen since you've seen her, Tom.

1:24:39.204 --> 1:24:41.415
All right? Hold on. Just wait a second.

1:24:43.375 --> 1:24:45.252
We gave her a sedative to calm her down,

1:24:45.252 --> 1:24:48.589
but she's gonna be experiencing
some pretty heavy withdrawal so--

1:24:48.589 --> 1:24:50.465
- Can I go in and talk to her?
- I'm gonna go with you.

1:24:50.465 --> 1:24:52.134
No. I'm okay.

1:25:03.437 --> 1:25:05.063
Did she say anything else?

1:25:06.773 --> 1:25:07.941
You have any more insight?

1:25:09.943 --> 1:25:11.320
Not yet.

1:25:23.624 --> 1:25:24.708
You all right, sweetheart?

1:25:24.708 --> 1:25:25.792
Yeah.

1:25:28.754 --> 1:25:30.088
Yeah. I'm okay.

1:25:30.797 --> 1:25:33.383
It's weird.
It's like, it's her, but it's not her.

1:25:33.383 --> 1:25:34.676
Did she tell you anything?

1:25:36.220 --> 1:25:37.262
Yeah, you were right.

1:25:37.930 --> 1:25:42.100
She wasn't working alone. There was--
There's this guy who was her accomplice.

1:25:42.100 --> 1:25:45.646
He taught her everything and trained her.

1:25:45.646 --> 1:25:47.064
He planned the whole thing.

1:25:47.064 --> 1:25:51.360
She said that he has
some sort of connection to-- to us.

1:25:51.985 --> 1:25:53.654
What kind of connection?

1:25:53.654 --> 1:25:57.574
She said that he knew all about me.
She said that it seemed personal.

1:25:59.618 --> 1:26:01.453
Did she describe him?

1:26:01.453 --> 1:26:05.040
- Did she say what he looked like at all?
- No, but he cheated her too.

1:26:05.832 --> 1:26:07.000
He left her with nothing.

1:26:09.419 --> 1:26:11.088
I told her she could stay here...

1:26:11.088 --> 1:26:13.966
- No, no, no, no. She can't stay here.
- ...and--

1:26:13.966 --> 1:26:15.050
- She's sick...
- No.

1:26:15.050 --> 1:26:16.593
- ...and she needs a place to detox...
- No.

1:26:16.593 --> 1:26:19.429
- ...and she regrets what she did.
- She's a junkie, you can't trust her.

1:26:19.429 --> 1:26:20.931
- She's gonna do anything to get money.
- I agree.

1:26:20.931 --> 1:26:22.808
- Very easy for me to do.
- No. She's staying here.

1:26:22.808 --> 1:26:25.394
I'll take care of her.
I'll bring doctors or nurses, or whatever.

1:26:25.394 --> 1:26:27.688
- But I wanna do this.
- Mr. Braddock, this isn't safe.

1:26:27.688 --> 1:26:29.690
- I need your help with this.
- Well, I--

1:26:29.690 --> 1:26:33.026
Look, I can put men outside her room.
She'll essentially be under lock and key.

1:26:33.026 --> 1:26:35.487
That's not what I'm worried about.
But, come on.

1:26:35.988 --> 1:26:37.614
I mean, are you ready
for when she sobers up

1:26:37.614 --> 1:26:40.492
- and you have to see the real her?
- I'm dying to see the real her.

1:26:40.492 --> 1:26:43.245
Okay. If she's gonna stay here,
then I need to talk to her.

1:26:43.787 --> 1:26:45.831
- No, wait. She needs to rest.
- No, I should.

1:27:32.503 --> 1:27:33.504
Sandra?

1:27:35.464 --> 1:27:36.465
Sandra?

1:27:41.970 --> 1:27:43.138
Hi, I'm Madeline.

1:27:44.139 --> 1:27:47.601
I was married to Tom's father.
I'm his stepmother.

1:27:50.187 --> 1:27:53.565
Suck my dick, you lying bitch.

1:27:55.609 --> 1:27:57.653
Yeah, I know who you are, Madeline.

1:27:59.613 --> 1:28:01.240
Max told me the whole score.

1:28:02.991 --> 1:28:06.203
That you set the cops on him,
but then had to beg him to come back.

1:28:06.703 --> 1:28:10.958
How there was an old man who was dying
and was gonna leave behind a fortune,

1:28:10.958 --> 1:28:12.501
and all we needed to do was...

1:28:13.919 --> 1:28:15.087
nudge aside the son

1:28:15.087 --> 1:28:17.881
so that his very full of shit widow
could inherit it all.

1:28:19.633 --> 1:28:20.801
So, what do you want?

1:28:20.801 --> 1:28:23.387
I wanna confess. Confess to it all

1:28:24.054 --> 1:28:26.014
and get this off my chest.

1:28:26.014 --> 1:28:27.933
Do me a favor and get Tom. Tom?

1:28:27.933 --> 1:28:29.101
How much?

1:28:31.019 --> 1:28:32.521
I don't want your money, bitch.

1:28:33.272 --> 1:28:34.273
You don't?

1:28:34.773 --> 1:28:36.859
Max and I were supposed to meet
at Penn Station.

1:28:37.568 --> 1:28:38.986
I waited there for three days.

1:28:39.570 --> 1:28:43.198
Because I was so fucking stupid,
I thought something had happened to him.

1:28:44.867 --> 1:28:45.784
Can you believe that?

1:28:48.704 --> 1:28:49.705
He left me.

1:28:53.792 --> 1:28:55.169
Then what can I do for you?

1:29:00.674 --> 1:29:01.884
I want Max.

1:29:03.510 --> 1:29:05.095
I wanna see Max.

1:29:07.097 --> 1:29:10.434
I wanna look into his face,
and I want him to see what he did to me.

1:29:12.811 --> 1:29:14.062
I wanna see Max.

1:29:15.522 --> 1:29:17.941
Honey, I don't know where he is.

1:29:17.941 --> 1:29:19.318
Well, you better find out.

1:29:20.611 --> 1:29:23.906
Or I will tell everyone in the next room
who you really fucking are.

1:29:32.831 --> 1:29:33.916
She can stay.

1:29:35.626 --> 1:29:37.211
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

1:29:37.211 --> 1:29:39.213
<i>to an automated voice message system.</i>

1:29:39.213 --> 1:29:40.672
<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

1:29:40.672 --> 1:29:43.967
<i>you may hang up
or press one for more options.</i>

1:29:45.344 --> 1:29:46.762
So, I have a problem.

1:29:46.762 --> 1:29:51.308
They found your girl getting high
off the Cross Bronx Expressway.

1:29:51.308 --> 1:29:54.811
And now she's in my apartment
pining after you.

1:29:55.729 --> 1:29:58.148
You really did a number on her,
didn't you?

1:29:58.148 --> 1:30:00.484
You-- You didn't have to go that hard.

1:30:00.484 --> 1:30:02.861
I mean, what the fuck did you tell her?

1:30:03.362 --> 1:30:04.363
Call me.

1:30:08.325 --> 1:30:10.494
Where is he? Where is he?

1:30:48.031 --> 1:30:50.659
Did you find him?

1:30:52.286 --> 1:30:54.162
Did you find him?

1:30:54.162 --> 1:30:55.956
<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

1:30:55.956 --> 1:30:58.792
<i>you may hang up

1:30:59.543 --> 1:31:03.922
<i>Max. Hey, it's me again.
Can you give me a call?</i>

1:31:21.773 --> 1:31:23.859
<i>Max told me the whole score.</i>

1:31:23.859 --> 1:31:25.110
<i>And I know who you are.</i>

1:31:25.652 --> 1:31:27.696
<i>Please call me back. I need you.</i>

1:31:27.696 --> 1:31:28.906
<i>I want Max.</i>

1:31:30.824 --> 1:31:33.702
<i>I wanna see Max. I wanna see Max.</i>

1:31:33.702 --> 1:31:35.662
<i>Just please call me back.
Come on, Max. Please.</i>

1:31:35.662 --> 1:31:37.289
<i>Or I will tell everyone in the next room</i>

1:31:37.289 --> 1:31:38.457
<i>who you really fucking are.</i>

1:31:46.673 --> 1:31:48.884
<i>Listen, I came back like you asked.</i>

1:31:48.884 --> 1:31:52.304
<i>I gave Tom a nervous breakdown.
I got my money. Now I'm out.</i>

1:31:53.096 --> 1:31:54.097
Yeah, but I--

1:31:56.058 --> 1:31:57.476
It's just that I...

1:32:00.062 --> 1:32:01.063
I think...

1:32:02.606 --> 1:32:03.607
I want you back.

1:32:07.319 --> 1:32:08.403
<i>You want me back?</i>

1:32:11.573 --> 1:32:12.574
Yeah.

1:32:14.993 --> 1:32:17.913
<i>You want me back to fix this.</i>

1:32:18.997 --> 1:32:19.998
Fuck, yes.

1:32:20.958 --> 1:32:23.085
- Put that down--
- Yeah, I know that's right.

1:32:23.085 --> 1:32:25.337
- Okay. And then I'm gonna--
- You're winning,

1:32:25.337 --> 1:32:28.048
so I don't understand
why you have so many questions.

1:32:28.048 --> 1:32:30.008
Are you cheating me? You hustling me?

1:32:30.008 --> 1:32:32.928
Hi. How's our young patient doing?

1:32:32.928 --> 1:32:35.597
- I'm doing a lot better. Thanks.
- Yeah, last night was rough,

1:32:35.597 --> 1:32:38.016
- but I think we're over the hump.
- That's a relief.

1:32:38.016 --> 1:32:39.142
You look a lot better.

1:32:40.310 --> 1:32:42.062
I was gonna take a walk.
Do you want to join me?

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:45.357
No. You know, she's still not 100%.

1:32:45.357 --> 1:32:47.359
I think the fresh air might do her good.

1:32:48.360 --> 1:32:50.112
- I don't know about that.
- No.

1:32:50.112 --> 1:32:52.531
- A walk would be perfect.
- Good. Brought you a sweater.

1:32:57.411 --> 1:32:58.996
That was fast. Where was he?

1:32:58.996 --> 1:33:00.497
You can ask him yourself.

1:33:02.165 --> 1:33:03.250
We have a deal, right?

1:33:04.293 --> 1:33:06.044
Once you see him, you get out of my life.

1:33:07.129 --> 1:33:09.006
- I don't want anything from you.
- Good.

1:33:15.512 --> 1:33:16.889
How can you do what you do?

1:33:18.223 --> 1:33:19.224
Practice.

1:33:48.295 --> 1:33:49.296
Where are we going?

1:34:28.043 --> 1:34:29.044
This is good.

1:35:00.242 --> 1:35:01.410
You left me!

1:35:01.410 --> 1:35:05.038
You-- I waited for days!
You fucking left me!

1:35:05.622 --> 1:35:06.540
How could you?

1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:08.792
You threw me aside
like I was fucking trash!

1:35:13.338 --> 1:35:16.133
Oh, my God. Please. You done?

1:35:17.718 --> 1:35:19.803
You got taken. That's what we do.

1:35:20.721 --> 1:35:23.432
So now, the question is,
how do we make this right by you?

1:35:24.057 --> 1:35:25.475
I want him to apologize.

1:35:26.435 --> 1:35:28.020
Well, he can't. Because he's not sorry.

1:35:30.230 --> 1:35:31.607
Did you feel anything for me?

1:35:33.984 --> 1:35:34.985
I felt nothing.

1:35:39.656 --> 1:35:41.033
What the fuck is this?

1:35:47.122 --> 1:35:47.998
Shit.

1:35:56.548 --> 1:35:57.966
What did I tell you?

1:35:57.966 --> 1:36:01.428
She's used these two to swipe
your inheritance right out from under you.

1:36:02.804 --> 1:36:04.014
What? You have nothing to say?

1:36:05.891 --> 1:36:07.601
The inheritance belongs to Tom.

1:36:07.601 --> 1:36:10.479
And you're gonna give it back to him.
It's his money.

1:36:10.479 --> 1:36:12.940
If it was Tom's money,
he would have his money.

1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:14.024
But it's my money.

1:36:14.775 --> 1:36:16.485
And you know what I'm gonna do
with my money?

1:36:16.485 --> 1:36:19.321
I'm gonna take a billion dollars
and aim it in your direction.

1:36:19.321 --> 1:36:23.200
Your three-bedroom in Scarsdale
or Lloyd Harbor, or whatever the fuck.

1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:26.370
It's gone. Your Benz. Gone.
Your kids' college fund.

1:36:26.370 --> 1:36:29.289
By the time I'm done with you,
it's all gone.

1:36:29.289 --> 1:36:31.041
'Cause it's
all about the money for you, right?

1:36:31.041 --> 1:36:33.544
That's all any of you care about
is the money.

1:36:34.127 --> 1:36:35.254
Right, Sandra?

1:36:38.465 --> 1:36:42.469
Hey! Say something! Answer me!

1:36:47.182 --> 1:36:48.934
- Hey, hey. Tom. Tom. No.
- Hey! Hey, hey.

1:36:48.934 --> 1:36:50.769
You've been fucking with me
since we first met.

1:36:50.769 --> 1:36:53.021
- Tom...
- Put the gun down. Put it down.

1:36:53.021 --> 1:36:54.273
You took everything.

1:36:55.774 --> 1:36:57.860
- I'm sorry.
- You're a fucking liar. Don't say--

1:36:57.860 --> 1:36:59.695
Tom, put it down. Come on.
Put the gun down.

1:36:59.695 --> 1:37:01.780
- Put the gun down. Tom.
- Put the gun down.

1:37:01.780 --> 1:37:04.867
I meant what I said, Tom.
I meant what I said.

1:37:21.341 --> 1:37:22.634
You're right. You're right. It's not you.

1:37:25.429 --> 1:37:27.431
- Tom, no! What are you doing?
- Hey. No. No, no, no, no. Tom, no.

1:37:27.431 --> 1:37:28.724
You did this. You ruined us.

1:37:28.724 --> 1:37:31.768
Look at me. Look what you did to me.
Look what you did to my dad!

1:37:31.768 --> 1:37:34.188
I took care of your father.
I kept him alive.

1:37:34.188 --> 1:37:36.190
- Bullshit!
- Tom, please don't do this.

1:37:36.190 --> 1:37:37.274
Just shut up.

1:37:37.274 --> 1:37:39.401
Tom, put it do-- Put the gun down, okay?

1:37:41.278 --> 1:37:44.448
Please, just put it down. Put it down.

1:37:48.535 --> 1:37:50.078
Tom, no.

1:37:50.078 --> 1:37:51.580
No!

1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:53.207
- Stay back.
- Put the gun down.

1:37:53.207 --> 1:37:54.166
Stay back.

1:37:54.166 --> 1:37:56.460
- Put the gun down, Madeline.
- You wanna kill me, Madeline?

1:37:56.460 --> 1:37:58.545
- Get back. Tom, no.
- You wanna shoot me? Just do it!

1:37:58.545 --> 1:38:01.006
- Hey! Tom.
- Just do it.

1:38:04.927 --> 1:38:07.304
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- What? What--

1:38:07.304 --> 1:38:08.430
Tom?

1:38:08.430 --> 1:38:10.015
Come on. Stay with me.

1:38:11.808 --> 1:38:13.227
Tom.

1:38:16.188 --> 1:38:17.189
What the fuck?

1:38:20.526 --> 1:38:21.527
Oh, my God.

1:38:24.488 --> 1:38:25.364
You killed him.

1:38:25.989 --> 1:38:29.409
I didn't. He-- He--
He shot himself. You saw it.

1:38:29.409 --> 1:38:30.494
- Call the police.
- I'm on it.

1:38:30.494 --> 1:38:32.246
- No!
- He killed himself.

1:38:32.246 --> 1:38:35.707
I'm sorry, what? Who the fuck are you?
Shut the fuck up. You're a part of this.

1:38:35.707 --> 1:38:38.377
- I need to report a shooting.
- I didn't do it. I-- I--

1:38:38.377 --> 1:38:40.462
- I didn't kill him.
- Yes, there's been a shooting.

1:38:40.462 --> 1:38:43.298
A young man's been shot in the chest.
I'm not sure.

1:38:43.298 --> 1:38:46.176
This-- This kid is dead. This is a--
This is-- This is a tragedy.

1:38:46.176 --> 1:38:49.263
- But I-- I didn't--
- No, she didn't. He killed himself.

1:38:49.263 --> 1:38:51.139
I can make amends. I can--

1:38:51.139 --> 1:38:52.975
- I can make amends.
- I'm sorry, what?

1:38:54.059 --> 1:38:55.185
I'll give the money back.

1:38:55.185 --> 1:38:57.479
- I'll give it to the Foundation.
- What are you talking about?

1:38:57.479 --> 1:38:59.273
- You're just gonna give it up?
- Yes.

1:38:59.982 --> 1:39:02.901
I don't want to go to jail
for something I didn't do!

1:39:02.901 --> 1:39:04.987
No. They're coming. The police are coming.

1:39:04.987 --> 1:39:08.657
You leave us to the police
and that money's not going anywhere.

1:39:08.657 --> 1:39:11.201
- Just think of what it can do.
- Oh, you.

1:39:11.952 --> 1:39:13.620
They'll give the money back!

1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:18.709
Please! Please! I beg you, please!
I don't wanna go to jail!

1:39:22.004 --> 1:39:23.255
What a fucking mess.

1:39:27.467 --> 1:39:30.429
Madeline Hobbes on line one.
She says it's urgent.

1:39:31.180 --> 1:39:32.306
Excuse me a minute.

1:39:34.141 --> 1:39:36.852
Madeline... Hello?

1:39:38.145 --> 1:39:39.146
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1:39:40.230 --> 1:39:42.107
<i>I wanna transfer my inheritance...</i>

1:39:43.066 --> 1:39:44.985
<i>to the Richard Hobbes Foundation.</i>

1:39:46.069 --> 1:39:48.947
<i>It was Richard's wish that you
receive the inheritance, Madeline.</i>

1:39:48.947 --> 1:39:50.032
<i>It's yours.</i>

1:39:50.032 --> 1:39:51.783
But I want it to go to the Foundation.

1:39:53.410 --> 1:39:54.786
And I want it done today.

1:39:56.663 --> 1:39:59.833
I need you to do this, David.
I need you to do this as soon as possible.

1:40:00.584 --> 1:40:02.628
<i>Madeline, what is this?
Are you under duress?</i>

1:40:05.422 --> 1:40:06.507
No.

1:40:07.174 --> 1:40:09.635
<i>You can tell me
if something has happened. I can help.</i>

1:40:11.345 --> 1:40:13.430
Next flight out is to Oklahoma City.

1:40:13.430 --> 1:40:15.766
We have 40 minutes. Keep moving.

1:40:16.350 --> 1:40:20.020
<i>Madeline?
Have you spoken to Tom about this?</i>

1:40:25.234 --> 1:40:26.485
You're my lawyer, right?

1:40:27.861 --> 1:40:29.363
<i>Yes. Of course.</i>

1:40:34.535 --> 1:40:37.371
<i>Then I want you to
do what I say and transfer the money.</i>

1:40:43.043 --> 1:40:44.044
All of it.

1:40:46.213 --> 1:40:47.631
<i>We'll prepare the papers.</i>

1:40:56.974 --> 1:40:58.559
Make it look like a robbery.

1:41:27.337 --> 1:41:29.590
You seem very calm
for someone who lost a lot of money.

1:41:29.590 --> 1:41:30.966
Well, I'm a professional.

1:41:31.675 --> 1:41:33.468
You gave away billions of dollars.

1:41:33.468 --> 1:41:35.012
- Is that what I did?
- Did you?

1:41:35.012 --> 1:41:36.180
I don't know. Did I?

1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:39.600
I mean, I gave the money
to the Foundation.

1:41:40.392 --> 1:41:42.311
The head of the Foundation is Tom.

1:41:42.311 --> 1:41:45.522
Or should I say, was.

1:41:46.356 --> 1:41:47.524
Tom is dead.

1:41:47.524 --> 1:41:50.861
And so, the money
is controlled by the trustee.

1:41:50.861 --> 1:41:52.112
And guess who that is?

1:41:58.076 --> 1:42:00.120
You're still talking about money.

1:42:00.787 --> 1:42:02.581
Yes. Yes, we are.

1:42:03.498 --> 1:42:04.666
Tom is dead.

1:42:06.126 --> 1:42:07.211
We killed him.

1:42:09.421 --> 1:42:10.422
We killed him.

1:42:10.422 --> 1:42:12.591
- Keep it together.
- I'm gonna be sick.

1:42:16.845 --> 1:42:18.180
We gotta get rid of her.

1:42:19.598 --> 1:42:22.518
We can't. She's a witness.
She knows too much.

1:42:23.602 --> 1:42:26.063
What is it? Did she get to you?

1:42:28.190 --> 1:42:29.233
No.

1:42:29.233 --> 1:42:31.318
It's okay. I mean, it happens.

1:42:31.318 --> 1:42:32.653
She didn't get to me.

1:42:33.737 --> 1:42:36.073
I mean, you can do what you want.

1:42:36.990 --> 1:42:37.991
I don't care.

1:42:39.076 --> 1:42:41.537
- She didn't get to me.
- Good.

1:42:42.204 --> 1:42:43.664
Would you like some water?

1:42:45.082 --> 1:42:46.083
Thanks.

1:42:57.594 --> 1:42:59.721
- This isn't blood.
- What?

1:42:59.721 --> 1:43:01.557
Look. It comes out too easily.

1:43:03.183 --> 1:43:04.518
- This isn't blood.
- Let me see.

1:43:06.979 --> 1:43:08.397
If it's not blood, then what is it?

1:43:10.899 --> 1:43:11.900
You tell me.

1:43:13.443 --> 1:43:14.444
What do you mean?

1:43:15.028 --> 1:43:16.029
Are you behind this?

1:43:17.865 --> 1:43:19.950
- Behind what?
- You got me to give away the money.

1:43:21.326 --> 1:43:25.122
- No, I did no such thing.
- No, Tom's alive. You fucked me.

1:43:25.122 --> 1:43:26.623
- What are you talking about?
- You fucked me.

1:43:26.623 --> 1:43:28.041
- I will fucking kill you.
- I didn't have anything--

1:43:28.041 --> 1:43:30.544
- I will fucking end you!
- I didn't have anything to do with this.

1:43:34.047 --> 1:43:35.215
Sandra.

1:43:43.098 --> 1:43:45.601
Sandra! Sandra?

1:44:01.366 --> 1:44:04.369
- <i>Merry Christmas, Max.</i>
- <i>Merry Christmas, Sandra.</i>

1:44:04.369 --> 1:44:06.914
<i>Sandy. Everybody calls me Sandy.</i>

1:44:07.831 --> 1:44:09.291
<i>We're gonna give people the impression</i>

1:44:09.291 --> 1:44:10.751
<i>that you're somebody that you're not.</i>

1:44:11.251 --> 1:44:13.378
<i>And when I'm done with you,
it's gonna be 100% convincing.</i>

1:44:14.546 --> 1:44:15.923
And what happens if I stay?

1:44:16.507 --> 1:44:17.508
<i>You work for me.</i>

1:44:18.133 --> 1:44:19.134
<i>Is this real?</i>

1:44:20.010 --> 1:44:20.886
<i>This is real.</i>

1:44:21.512 --> 1:44:22.846
How can I be sure?

1:44:24.056 --> 1:44:25.557
<i>I really like you.</i>

1:44:26.517 --> 1:44:27.976
<i>I really like you too.</i>

1:44:29.353 --> 1:44:30.896
<i>It's my brother. He needs money.</i>

1:44:30.896 --> 1:44:33.273
- Jason. Keep your voice--
- Listen. Yo, listen to me for two seconds!

1:44:33.273 --> 1:44:35.692
I live with my dad and his new wife.

1:44:36.902 --> 1:44:38.278
He thinks I'm a disappointment.

1:44:40.155 --> 1:44:41.740
<i>But you're not a disappointment.</i>

1:44:43.992 --> 1:44:44.826
<i>I love you.</i>

1:44:47.996 --> 1:44:49.915
<i>You can't cheat an honest man, right?</i>

1:44:50.916 --> 1:44:52.793
<i>That's why we never feel sorry
for the mark.</i>

1:44:57.464 --> 1:44:59.132
<i>Max told me the whole score.</i>

1:45:00.968 --> 1:45:04.847
<i>There was an old man who was dying
and was gonna leave behind a fortune.</i>

1:45:07.724 --> 1:45:09.768
<i>We just needed to nudge aside the son</i>

1:45:09.768 --> 1:45:14.064
<i>so that his very full of shit widow
could inherit it all.</i>

1:45:23.782 --> 1:45:24.867
<i>I wanna confess.</i>

1:45:28.787 --> 1:45:29.913
<i>Confess to it all.</i>

1:45:36.003 --> 1:45:37.504
<i>I'm so sorry for all of this.</i>

1:45:41.300 --> 1:45:42.301
How you doing, Tipsy?

1:45:47.306 --> 1:45:49.558
Richard's dead
and Madeline got all the money.

1:45:49.558 --> 1:45:52.186
<i>What she pulled
required a great deal of sophistication.</i>

1:45:52.186 --> 1:45:54.021
<i>I don't see how this woman did it alone.</i>

1:45:54.021 --> 1:45:55.397
<i>I think we're looking
for more than one person.</i>

1:45:55.397 --> 1:45:56.732
There's a white dude named Goldie.

1:45:56.732 --> 1:45:59.693
We like to call him Goldie
'cause he got-- he got, like red hair.

1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:05.490
We have to take this out of here.

1:46:05.490 --> 1:46:06.658
<i>Yeah, you were right.</i>

1:46:08.118 --> 1:46:11.205
<i>There was-- There was this guy
who was her accomplice.</i>

1:46:12.497 --> 1:46:16.418
<i>He taught her everything and trained her.
He planned the whole thing.</i>

1:46:18.295 --> 1:46:19.421
No. One more time.

1:46:19.922 --> 1:46:22.883
<i>He cheated her too.
He left her with nothing.</i>

1:46:35.354 --> 1:46:36.647
<i>How can you do what you do?</i>

1:46:39.733 --> 1:46:40.776
<i>Practice.</i>

1:47:56.185 --> 1:47:58.353
Hey, excuse me, I got a quick question.

1:47:58.353 --> 1:48:00.063
I need to know where the fuck

1:48:00.063 --> 1:48:03.233
- is my money? Look at y'all.
- There he is.

1:48:03.901 --> 1:48:06.028
- Look like undercover cops. What's up?
- What's up, baby?

1:48:06.028 --> 1:48:07.362
- How you doing?
- Here's your money.

1:48:07.362 --> 1:48:12.034
Okay. Not bad, Sandy.
Max taught you well, I see.

1:48:12.034 --> 1:48:15.704
All right, last chance, huh?
I really could use someone like you.

1:48:15.704 --> 1:48:17.289
Sorry, Goldie. I'm done.

1:48:17.289 --> 1:48:19.875
- Yeah, whatever. I heard that one before.
- I'm done.

1:48:19.875 --> 1:48:21.877
- All right. We gotta bounce.
- Yeah.

1:48:21.877 --> 1:48:23.295
- See you guys later.
- Peace.

1:48:23.295 --> 1:48:24.588
- Take it easy.
- Gonna invest in some real estate, baby.

1:48:24.588 --> 1:48:25.631
- Let's get it!
- Yep!

1:48:29.426 --> 1:48:30.427
Bye, Sandy.

1:48:43.607 --> 1:48:45.067
You got a lot of money, Tom.

1:48:46.610 --> 1:48:48.028
I hope you can do some good with it.

1:48:49.947 --> 1:48:50.948
I will.

1:48:52.282 --> 1:48:54.243
- Thank you.
- You're thanking me?

1:48:54.243 --> 1:48:55.786
I got everything taken from you.

1:48:58.205 --> 1:48:59.498
You also got it back.

1:49:15.389 --> 1:49:18.517
So, there's this great little
Japanese restaurant on Mott Street.

1:49:20.352 --> 1:49:22.020
If you're not doing anything,
dinner's on me.

1:49:29.152 --> 1:49:30.404
Well, I am single.

1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:33.782
And I kinda like being single.
