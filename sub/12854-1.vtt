WEBVTT

01:39.933 --> 01:43.603
Get off the babysitter.
Daddy's home.

02:20.724 --> 02:24.602
What is an Angel doing
so far from Heaven?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.237
I'm no Angel.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.269
This is hostel, yeah?

03:49.980 --> 03:52.982
I'm good at the bulI, no?

04:43.867 --> 04:47.912
MarshaI Ray Carter? I'm Alex Munday.
I'Il be your rescuer today.

04:48.080 --> 04:51.248
I didn't think you'd find me.
How many men do you have?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.542
I've got two girIfriends in the bar.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.336
They have 50 armed men.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.798
I know. It hardIy seems fair.
Come on.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.345
-What is it?
-My ribs.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.889
DyIan? Dylan,
we need to get out of here.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.557
I'm on top of it.

05:19.277 --> 05:23.447
-They got my ring.
-I'm sure your wife wilI understand.

05:38.338 --> 05:38.921
KiIl them!

05:39.506 --> 05:41.090
KiIl them aIl!

06:24.468 --> 06:26.802
Plan B.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.162
Just once, I'd like to walk out of a bar.

07:12.808 --> 07:14.266
Let's go!

07:30.992 --> 07:32.326
Now!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.518
-Get in!
-You got him?

08:04.985 --> 08:06.026
DyIan!

08:07.946 --> 08:09.238
Go for it!

08:09.406 --> 08:11.407
-DyIan!
-I'm trying!

08:21.042 --> 08:24.044
I'm afraid
I underestimated you guys.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.421
Yeah.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.923
That happens a lot.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.782
It was three girls!

08:53.950 --> 08:55.701
Three crazy beautiful girls.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.952
But we have the ring.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.997
I always knew this day would come...

09:00.582 --> 09:02.875
Let's go to plan B.

09:06.213 --> 09:10.257
Once upon a time, there were three
very different little girls.

09:26.024 --> 09:29.777
Come on, Alex. This is the last pass.
You can do it!

09:31.988 --> 09:34.406
Harder! Harder! Harder!

09:52.050 --> 09:55.177
I want you! I want you now!

09:55.345 --> 09:59.348
Who grew up to be three
very different women.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.392
No.

10:24.708 --> 10:25.749
Okay.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.051
You, hot water.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.221
Here it goes. Here it goes.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.434
There we go.

10:43.601 --> 10:48.147
Now they work for me.
My name is Charlie.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.593
Perimeter secure.
We're ready for takeoff.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.262
WelI done, Agent McDoweIl.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.298
Hey, check this out.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.426
Our first piece of mail.

14:11.476 --> 14:15.729
-Your 1 0-year high-school reunion.
-It'lI be a fun night, Nat.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.273
-Isn't that cool?
-It's great.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.111
I still can't beIieve Nat and Pete
are moving in together.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.865
-Our little Angel's growing up.
-It's wiId that NataIie owns property.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.368
The most expensive thing I own
are these boots.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.788
-Excuse me. Those are my boots.
-Whatever. My point is--

14:37.710 --> 14:38.919
I forgot my point.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.296
You're broke, horny
and wearing my boots.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.382
Thank you.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.306
So you thought you could escape
my fortress.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.100
Not so fast.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.732
-Oh, my God! Jason.
-Surprise.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.986
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.821
That was fun.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.823
Fun. Yeah.

15:08.825 --> 15:13.453
-What are you doing here?
-I miss you. Look--

15:16.833 --> 15:20.002
What are you doing later, after this?
Later on?

15:21.796 --> 15:25.132
Jason, I thought we were
on a time-out.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.343
What? We can't fool around at alI?

15:28.511 --> 15:31.847
Hey, Jason.
I didn't think you'd make it.

15:32.015 --> 15:36.101
Yeah, the photo shoot ran late. Plus,
I wanted to miss alI the heavy stuff.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.186
-Hey, Jason.
-Hey.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.314
-How's the sequel going?
-Great.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.692
We had, Iike, 1 3 writers,
so it should be pretty good.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.737
-I loved the first one.
-Yeah, it was great.

15:47.905 --> 15:52.951
Sorry. We got a great title for this
one: Maximum Extreme-2.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.998
The premiere's Friday,
so I brought you tickets.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.542
I love tickets!

16:03.963 --> 16:05.547
-Hello?
-Yeah?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.674
-Be right in.
-Thanks.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.384
Sorry.

16:10.219 --> 16:13.055
-Thanks for heIping out, Jason.
-Yeah, yeah.

16:14.182 --> 16:15.223
Charlie.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.811
Bosley!

16:19.979 --> 16:22.689
What's happening, Angels?
How y'all doing?

16:22.899 --> 16:24.066
-Hey.
-Hey, Bos.

16:24.233 --> 16:27.736
Look here. I see my brother
ain't checked the books in a while.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.071
We have a book?

16:29.405 --> 16:33.325
Look here, lovelies, I onIy been here
a few days, but wiIl you explain...

16:33.493 --> 16:34.951
...what the hell is this?

16:35.119 --> 16:36.203
Now, what--?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.707
CarefuI with that, Bos.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.876
I'm aIl right.

16:43.252 --> 16:47.547
And I aIso see y'all being played.
Five G's for a KevIar vest?

16:47.715 --> 16:50.550
-We need those.
-They're made especialIy for us.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.762
What? You all fine, but you crazy.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.350
What?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.102
Bosley, come here.

17:00.603 --> 17:02.104
-Have a seat, Bos.
-Okay.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.563
-Bos.
-What?

17:03.731 --> 17:05.190
B.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.652
Your brother didn't sweat the details.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.113
-We do what it takes.
-Right.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.281
So, what does a Bosley do
around here?

17:13.616 --> 17:17.452
-He does the most important job of aIl.
-What's that?

17:17.619 --> 17:20.454
He connects us with Charlie.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.669
Okay. All right. AlI right.

17:25.837 --> 17:28.547
-Good morning, Angels.
-Good morning, Charlie.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.967
Bosley, l hope the Angels
aren't being too rough on you.

17:32.135 --> 17:36.096
Man, please. I date fat women.
What are you talking about?

17:37.014 --> 17:39.224
Great work in Mongolia, Angels...

17:39.392 --> 17:42.894
...but l'm afraid the case
has taken a new turn.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.439
Goddamn! What the f--?
Look-- Look--

17:47.900 --> 17:51.153
I know where I'm watching
the game at tonight. Look at that.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.532
Angels, I'd like to introduce Roger
Wixon, senior director of the FBl.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.325
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.827
-Hi.
-Hello.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.037
Over the years,
the Townsend Agency...

18:01.205 --> 18:03.373
...has worked on projects
for the bureau...

18:03.541 --> 18:07.419
...but never one with so many
innocent lives at stake.

18:07.587 --> 18:11.173
Hey, I'm busy watching
that doggone screen.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.966
Good job, Bos.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.971
Angels, you're aware of the Federal
Witness Protection Program.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.390
PeopIe who testify
against major crime figures...

18:20.558 --> 18:22.809
...are relocated
and given new identities.

18:22.977 --> 18:27.355
The identities of these witnesses are
protected by a program called HALO:

18:27.523 --> 18:29.733
Hidden Alias List Operation.

18:29.901 --> 18:33.195
The list is encrypted
on two titanium rings.

18:33.362 --> 18:36.448
The data on each ring is
indecipherable on its own...

18:36.616 --> 18:40.702
...but when they are read together,
their codes unlock each other.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.162
Who wears the rings?

18:42.330 --> 18:44.998
The head of the U.S. Marshal Service
was wearing one.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.083
-Ray Carter.
-Good morning.

18:47.251 --> 18:51.046
-Hey, how are you feeling?
-Couple of fractured ribs, but i'll live.

18:51.214 --> 18:52.547
Who wears the other ring?

18:52.715 --> 18:56.343
The head of security for the Justice
Department, William Rose Bailey.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.887
Unfortunately, he was killed
this morning.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.140
-Now both rings are in the open.
-So the Iist is out.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.392
Someone's contacted the major
crime families offering to sell the list.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.023
One of our protected witness,
Alan Caufield...

19:10.233 --> 19:12.067
...was found dead at home
in the Valley.

19:12.235 --> 19:17.531
Angels, we need to get the HALO
rings back before the list is sold.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.076
-We'll start at the Caufield house.
-See if that leads us to HALO.

19:21.244 --> 19:25.580
Hey, CharIie, we could realIy use
Bosley's help on this one.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.250
-Get to drive the racecar?
-Not today.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.377
-Blow up a castle?
-Not yet, Bos.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.629
WelI, what do y'alI need me to do?

19:33.548 --> 19:37.259
-Read some body language.
-Hell, yeah.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.873
I'm not going nowhere near
no dead body.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.964
Freeze, Iadies. If you're not a dead
body, other side of the ropes.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.259
We got a serious situation here.
My men have the area secure.

20:19.427 --> 20:21.636
I have to ask you
to evacuate immediately.

20:21.804 --> 20:27.559
We got a 21 1 , a 1 83, believe it or not,
we got an 1 1-350, and it ain't pretty.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.897
An 1 1-350? You found an illegaI
chinchilla ranch on the premises?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.524
It's a chinchilla farm.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.443
But you're good.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.820
Negatory to orders
to reIinquish locality.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.989
Circumspect to your observation...

20:41.157 --> 20:45.160
...we'Il proceed to the interior of the
dwelling with your accompaniment.

20:45.328 --> 20:50.290
WelI, I do not copy. Repeat, do not
copy. I'll have to ask my sergeant.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.834
Your sergeant is here.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.938
Hands off.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.359
If you had your game faces on at the
academy, you ought to figure this out.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.404
Simple cafÃ© coronary.
Freak show choked to death.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.156
Questions?

21:23.866 --> 21:27.535
Examination of soft palate reveals
porcine byproduct...

21:27.703 --> 21:29.371
...lodged in vestibule.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.041
Okay, let's do this. Come on, baby.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.252
Caufield shows no signs
of trauma to the larynx.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.047
His struggIe pattern indicates
that he didn't choke.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.550
He was smothered.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.220
Ladies, we got some
carnauba residue.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.180
PineappIe.

21:47.348 --> 21:50.475
Oh, it's Sex Wax. Best for your stick.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.893
Pardon me?

21:52.061 --> 21:54.145
-The killer's a surfer.
-How do you know?

21:54.313 --> 21:57.440
He used the credit card he uses
to scrape wax off his board...

21:58.401 --> 22:00.193
...to gain entry into the house.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.654
Thrasher scumbag surfers.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.739
Freeze!

22:05.574 --> 22:10.286
I found a foreign print. He was wearing
reissued 1 989 Air Jordans.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.330
A limited promotionaI version sold...

22:12.498 --> 22:15.750
...only at the Foot Locker
in Fontana, in the summer of 2002.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.087
There's a discrepancy
in weight distribution...

22:19.255 --> 22:22.090
...between the left and right sides.

22:22.258 --> 22:26.928
An anterior cruciate Iigament
that was repaired in the last year.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.431
AlI right, who did it?

22:29.598 --> 22:31.766
A kilIer with a scar on his knee
who surfs.

22:31.934 --> 22:32.976
Did he stink?

22:33.144 --> 22:36.771
There's a hurricane off Baja. That
means good swelIs for south beaches.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.231
Was there a lot of blood?

22:38.399 --> 22:41.359
Offshore winds, Third Point.
Malibu's pumping.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.530
-Alex, surfboards are at your house.
-Share it with me, Angels.

22:46.574 --> 22:47.782
Freeze!

22:51.454 --> 22:53.997
Daddy? Daddy!

22:54.165 --> 22:58.293
Darling! I was meeting your mother
in Bali, and they canceled the flight.

22:58.461 --> 23:03.131
Some sort of monsoon.
So how is my favorite IittIe ferret?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.633
Do the face.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.387
No, come on. Do it properly.

23:14.310 --> 23:17.479
That is so cute.
I do the whiskers with my dad.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.484
Mr. Munday, it is such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.152
I'm DyIan.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.487
That's NataIie.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.114
I assure you,
none of the stories are true.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.658
WelI, some of them are.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.412
So you work with Alex
at the hospital?

23:37.708 --> 23:41.377
Yes! Natalie works
in the psychiatric ward...

23:41.545 --> 23:44.631
...and DyIan is the head
of gynecology.

23:45.674 --> 23:46.966
Really?

23:47.134 --> 23:48.927
-So young.
-I know.

23:49.095 --> 23:54.182
We were just on our way out. We have
a major procedure coming up, so....

23:54.934 --> 23:58.561
-Duty calls. Sorry.
-I've got to prep.

23:58.729 --> 23:59.771
Scrub up.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.314
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.732
See you in a minute.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.401
It's just a tiny emergency.
Make yourself at home.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.529
We'll talk later.
Go save Iives.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.531
Love you.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.161
Head of gynecology?

24:26.674 --> 24:28.424
Wait a second.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.345
Bos? There's a waxer on your 6.

24:32.513 --> 24:33.555
Is that you, Lord?

24:33.722 --> 24:36.391
Get in there and see
if he uses pineapple Sex Wax.

24:36.559 --> 24:38.434
DyIan, check it out.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.147
I got sand in my ass.
I can't hardIy walk.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.233
Just bIend in. Be cool, Bos.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.160
Got any wax?

24:55.327 --> 24:56.786
Great job, Bos.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.749
Is that grape? It's grape.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.459
It's grape!

25:03.627 --> 25:04.752
Yes, sir!

25:04.920 --> 25:07.505
Suspect four eIiminated.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.302
What's up, Angel?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.892
-Madison Lee?
-Natalie Cook?

25:19.059 --> 25:20.310
Oh, my God.

25:22.897 --> 25:24.189
How did you know?

25:24.356 --> 25:27.108
-I get the newsletter.
-Of course.

25:27.610 --> 25:31.779
Wow. I've heard so many stories
about you. You're my favorite Angel.

25:31.947 --> 25:35.325
She won the Nobel Prize for her
research on flying mammals.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.702
And predicted Carmine DeSoto's
every move...

25:37.870 --> 25:40.163
...by using the Cosmo
Bedside Astrologer.

25:42.958 --> 25:47.128
I also set the cIock on CharIie's VCR.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.256
And she invented the moIar mike.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.134
-DyIan and Alex?
-Yeah.

25:55.012 --> 25:59.307
-God, how I miss stakeouts.
-I know. Aren't they the best?

25:59.934 --> 26:02.352
Bring it on Bitch!

26:04.438 --> 26:06.397
Only one waxer left.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.690
Wait a second.

26:08.275 --> 26:10.735
Subpatellar scar, Ieft knee.

26:10.903 --> 26:15.156
Check it out. Brown shorts, red board,
1 1 o'clock. What do you think?

26:17.493 --> 26:19.077
-Yummy.
-That's what I thought.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.080
Case closed. Nat, move in.
DyIan thinks he's hot.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.331
What do you mean?

26:23.499 --> 26:26.125
You always fall for the bad guy.

26:26.794 --> 26:29.671
Then this guy must be reaIly eviI.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.590
You should see the new agency.
It's beautifuI.

26:32.758 --> 26:36.594
Maybe I wilI. TelI Charlie helIo
for me when you see him.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.847
You know.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.709
There she goes.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.254
Who do you think wiIl be
the first of us to Ieave?

27:11.422 --> 27:13.298
You, me or NataIie?

27:13.465 --> 27:16.384
-What are you talking about?
-I think it'll be Nat.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.219
Why? Did she say something?

27:18.387 --> 27:21.389
Nat and Pete Iive together now.
Soon they'lI be engaged...

27:21.557 --> 27:23.725
...and you and I will wear
pink dresses...

27:23.892 --> 27:27.228
...at the wedding
of Mr. and Mrs. Pete Kominsky.

27:28.355 --> 27:32.358
Yeah, but even if she got married,
she'd never Ieave us.

27:32.526 --> 27:36.529
Sooner or later, you and I are gonna
have to break in a new Angel.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.533
Good morning, Angels.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.161
Good morning, Charlie.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.249
-Good morning, Angels.
-Good morning, Charlie.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.212
Good morning, Angels.

27:53.380 --> 28:00.303
Good morning, Charlie.

28:03.932 --> 28:08.061
I mean, you didn't think it wouId be
the three of us forever, did you?

28:08.395 --> 28:11.564
I think I Iost my nuts.
Your nuts ever get small?

28:11.732 --> 28:16.110
When I get in water, they just shrink
up. They become like one marble.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.292
KiIler, huh?

28:32.127 --> 28:33.294
I just got so excited.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.297
When it's big like that,
I love to ride it hard and rough.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.050
Sorry.

28:39.468 --> 28:43.429
The way I was getting pounded,
I'm gonna be wet for hours.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.986
Catch you later.

29:00.948 --> 29:03.032
Randy Emmers.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.871
-PineappIe Sex Wax.
-"The Coal BowI."

29:09.039 --> 29:12.542
Hey, check it out.
"Leo," that could be his next target.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.345
This is it.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.347
The CoaI Bowl.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.766
Let's get dirty.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.030
-I'Il buy in.
-I'Il find Leo.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.658
I'Il look for Emmers.

29:45.909 --> 29:47.952
-I'Il look for Emmers.
-Yeah.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.167
AlI right, Leo, you're mine.

29:55.002 --> 29:56.961
Good luck.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.630
-You in charge here?
-You know it.

29:59.798 --> 30:03.593
-I want in.
-It's a two-G buy-in. Winner takes all.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.138
-Rules are, there are no ruIes.
-I'm down.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.391
Three out of four
don't cross the finish Iine.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.060
I'Il take those odds.

30:17.191 --> 30:19.108
Hey, how's it going?

30:19.276 --> 30:22.528
-Metzger's at the far double.
-Is this your first time--?

30:22.696 --> 30:24.864
CarmichaeI's at the finish line.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.200
I was thinking may--

30:48.180 --> 30:50.598
You and Pete moving in together
is a big deal.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.560
-Yeah, it's great, isn't it?
-So where do you see this going?

30:54.728 --> 30:57.271
Going? I'm confused.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.358
Okay, say someone was
to come up to me and say:

31:00.526 --> 31:04.028
"Hey, Dylan, do you think
Natalie wants to get married?"

31:04.363 --> 31:09.534
What? Did Pete ask you to ask me
if I wanted to get married?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.953
-No.
-Because we just moved in together.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.247
Heads up, I've spotted Emmers.
I'm on him.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.624
Red bike, red helmet.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.648
Nat, number 25. Check it out.

31:41.275 --> 31:43.359
The Iion. That's Leo.

31:44.695 --> 31:46.487
I got it. The guy in blue.

31:59.293 --> 32:01.085
I got shut out.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.677
-What was that?
-He's after Leo.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.689
He just took out a guy
in the front double.

32:26.320 --> 32:29.322
-He's making his way up to Leo.
-I'm gonna get him.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.709
That's it! Let's get in there.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.189
I got him, I got him!

33:07.819 --> 33:10.196
-He's gonna crush him!
-Look out, Nat!

33:11.657 --> 33:13.908
What the hell are you doing?!

33:16.828 --> 33:18.537
Nat, he's on your 6.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.670
No, Natalie!

33:27.339 --> 33:30.549
-Natalie!
-I'm okay.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.763
We gotta take him out!

33:43.313 --> 33:44.772
I'Il get back in.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.202
Let's go!

33:58.370 --> 33:59.620
Get him at the double.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.331
-You okay?
-Yeah.

34:47.835 --> 34:50.463
Hey, what are you doing with my bike?

35:21.661 --> 35:22.828
DyIan!

35:47.729 --> 35:50.189
The Thin Man.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.951
He's dead.

36:03.245 --> 36:06.413
-What the hell is going on?
-Hey, you're just a kid.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.374
I'm 1 5 and a haIf.

36:08.542 --> 36:11.001
Photos. AIan Caufield.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.797
-Max Petroni.
-How'd you know my real name?

36:16.383 --> 36:17.550
What the hell's this?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.845
Hey, this is a picture of DyIan.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.973
The name on the back
is Helen Zaas.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.938
Helen Zaas.

36:32.274 --> 36:33.941
My name
before I went into...

36:34.109 --> 36:36.610
...the Witness Protection Program
8 years ago.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.904
And then I became Dylan Sanders.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.615
When the FBl realized
the young lady's potential...

36:42.117 --> 36:43.450
...they gave me a call.

36:43.618 --> 36:46.453
-Okay, wait. HeIen Zaas?
-Yeah.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.997
-That's your name?
-Yeah.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.957
Helen Zaas.

36:51.376 --> 36:56.130
So where does that name come
from originalIy? Is that Ass-tralian?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.966
Yeah.

36:59.134 --> 37:02.136
Oh, my God, you must have been
the butt of every joke.

37:02.304 --> 37:06.432
-Did you drive an Aston Martin?
-Alex, we're being asinine.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.142
Yes, you are.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.478
Don't worry, Dylan. We're still
gonna be your best butties.

37:12.314 --> 37:17.151
Now, Angels, a rose by any
other name still smells as sweet.

37:17.319 --> 37:19.570
Thank you, Charlie.
It's not that funny.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.863
Yeah, it is.

37:21.031 --> 37:23.824
-Bos, can I get a ruling on this one?
-You sure can.

37:23.992 --> 37:28.329
You know what? Personally,
I'm not interested in Helen Zaas.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.247
I'm more concerned about yours.

37:30.415 --> 37:33.500
No matter what,
you're still gonna be our Dylan.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.502
-Thank you, Bos.
-You're welcome.

37:35.670 --> 37:39.048
Let me guess,
you fell for the bad guy.

37:39.215 --> 37:41.759
I fell for the worst guy.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.178
But he was so cute,
and I Iiked him so much.

37:44.346 --> 37:45.930
We had so much fun together...

37:46.097 --> 37:48.974
...just driving around,
listening to metaI and....

38:01.863 --> 38:04.031
And then one night,
things got realIy bad.

38:09.245 --> 38:14.541
I love you!
I would die for you, Seamus!

38:15.293 --> 38:17.127
O'Grady.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.172
You got some balIs.

38:28.390 --> 38:32.518
He said he'd kilI me if I told anyone,
but I had to put him away.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.813
-Of course you did.
-You did the right thing.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.024
-He was my first.
-Really?

38:39.192 --> 38:43.070
-But you told me you never did it.
-My first bust.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.739
-Yeah.
-Who was this guy?

38:47.492 --> 38:51.453
-Seamus O'Grady.
-O'Grady?

38:51.621 --> 38:54.873
-As in the Irish mob?
-I sent him to prison.

39:07.637 --> 39:09.513
O'Grady.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.599
You're out.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.817
O'Grady, what about your belongings?

39:35.123 --> 39:37.958
So if I have these, she'll find me?

39:42.088 --> 39:45.049
-The O'Gradys kilIed my parents.
-What?

39:45.759 --> 39:47.259
Sorry, Max.

39:47.844 --> 39:49.887
I testified against them.

39:50.138 --> 39:55.267
Wait a second. Alan Caufield.
He testified against the O'Gradys.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.645
That's it. The O'Gradys must have
HALO. This is our one Iead.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.898
The Thin Man.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.817
-Our favorite assassin.
-That's right.

40:03.985 --> 40:07.654
-This needs to go get analyzed.
-Yes, let's get up in there and do that.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.448
Let me see it.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.703
Yeah, I know exactIy what this is.
I have one.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.747
The nuns gave it to us
at the orphanage.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.749
Orphanage.

40:18.917 --> 40:22.669
-Good work.
-Max is in our protective custody now.

40:22.837 --> 40:27.800
-It's up to us to keep him safe.
-Hey, I know the safest place in town.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.109
Listen, don't you worry about a thing.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.362
No O'Grady ever set foot
in South CentraI. Can you dig it?

40:48.530 --> 40:50.030
-Yeah.
-This is my mama house.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.991
Rule number one: Don't look
her in the eye. Understand?

40:53.159 --> 40:54.868
Or she'll pop. Can you dig it?

40:55.411 --> 40:57.037
-Bosley.
-Yes, ma'am?

40:57.205 --> 40:58.747
You get over here.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.124
Hey, Mama.

41:00.291 --> 41:03.794
-What kind of troubIe you in now?
-I'm not in any trou-- Yes, ma'am.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.212
-Come on.
-Yes, ma'am.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.728
-Look at those knockers.
-Boys!

41:29.404 --> 41:32.072
Mother superior will see you now.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.662
Mother, do you recognize this man?

41:38.830 --> 41:40.914
Of course I know who he is.

41:41.082 --> 41:44.334
We called him Anthony,
after St. Anthony of Padua...

41:44.502 --> 41:48.505
...heaIer of the mute.
Please come forward.

41:49.757 --> 41:51.800
Please, girls.

41:58.016 --> 42:02.060
But his real name, like so much
about him, was a mystery.

42:05.106 --> 42:08.400
He came to us when he was 7.

42:08.943 --> 42:13.572
He was found wandering in the hills,
living off roots and insects.

42:13.740 --> 42:16.783
We believe his family was in
a Romanian circus troupe...

42:17.243 --> 42:19.912
...who died in a terrible fire.

42:20.079 --> 42:23.123
Although the doctors could find
nothing physically wrong...

42:23.291 --> 42:25.250
...he never spoke a word.

42:25.418 --> 42:29.630
And there were other idiosyncrasies.
He was a painfully shy child...

42:29.797 --> 42:34.134
...until it came time
for his monthly haircut.

42:43.311 --> 42:46.772
Then one morning,
he was simply gone.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.775
The Thin Man was protecting Max.

42:51.194 --> 42:54.821
So you're saying this man is the sole
benefactor of your orphanage?

42:54.989 --> 42:58.575
Yes, he really is an angel.

42:59.994 --> 43:03.455
Mother, have you had
contact with him since?

43:03.623 --> 43:05.582
WelI, not realIy that much...

43:05.750 --> 43:08.168
...except for the odd haircut
now and then.

43:13.508 --> 43:17.344
But he does send gifts.
Like this morning.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.931
-Emmers' car.
-That is a nice ride.

43:21.099 --> 43:25.852
An originaI 1 967
numbers-matching GTO.

43:30.692 --> 43:33.193
-Thorn Birds.
-I know.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.322
Bird poo.

43:37.490 --> 43:40.993
What order did you girls
say you were from again?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.829
-Larus californicus.
-California gulI.

43:43.997 --> 43:46.290
Fecal matter consists mostly
of scaIy cIypeiform.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.209
Sardines that fed
on large brown aIgae, I'd say.

43:49.377 --> 43:52.838
There's also traces of tanker fuel
and storm-water runoff as well.

43:53.006 --> 43:55.966
Sea guIls, tankers, storm water.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.552
San Pedro Harbor.

44:15.320 --> 44:18.238
-Who are you?
-What?! Wait.

44:19.741 --> 44:21.033
-What?
-Who are you?

44:21.200 --> 44:23.702
Oh, Jason Gibbons.

44:24.537 --> 44:26.330
The actor.

44:27.081 --> 44:29.666
Maybe you've seen
Maximum Extreme.

44:29.834 --> 44:31.335
No.

44:31.502 --> 44:34.087
-It was such a big movie.
-What are you doing here?

44:34.255 --> 44:37.466
-I'm Alex's boyfriend.
-Alex's boyfriend.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.719
Yeah. Well, technicaIly,
we're on what she caIls a time-out.

44:41.763 --> 44:44.765
-What does that mean?
-Exactly. Thank you.

44:44.932 --> 44:49.853
Yeah. I gotta say, you must be
the world's most understanding father.

44:50.271 --> 44:52.939
-Why?
-AlI the wild stuff she does.

44:53.107 --> 44:56.610
When I first met Alex,
I thought she was a bikini waxer.

44:57.779 --> 45:00.030
It was months before
I knew about CharIie.

45:01.366 --> 45:02.741
Who's Charlie?

45:20.134 --> 45:22.177
Merkin.

45:22.345 --> 45:25.389
That was the name
of Seamus' pit bull.

45:27.767 --> 45:31.937
Armed guards.
Security looks pretty tight.

45:32.105 --> 45:34.689
This dock is like a fortress.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.984
ID badges.
I think cargo's our best bet.

45:38.152 --> 45:40.904
-Townsend Agency.
-Bos, recon incoming.

45:41.072 --> 45:44.032
-Got you, baby.
-Yeah, check the photo.

45:49.956 --> 45:52.332
That's our man.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.794
The Treasure Chest.

45:56.712 --> 45:59.756
-Do a little dance.
-Make a little love.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.759
Get down tonight.

46:37.920 --> 46:42.048
-There he is, first table on the right.
-Yeah, baby!

48:45.840 --> 48:47.591
Hold.

48:59.020 --> 49:02.439
-Paddy O'Malley?
-Top of the morning to you.

49:02.607 --> 49:07.360
You know, you just don't look much
like any Paddy I've ever seen before.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.738
Ain't never heard
of no black Irish?

49:09.905 --> 49:11.448
-Black Irish?
-That's right.

49:11.616 --> 49:14.618
Who do you think invented
the McRib, Lucky Charms, huh?

49:14.785 --> 49:17.912
-Shamrock Shake? That's ours.
-Give me your papers.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.873
-What?
-Your papers.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.708
Let me tell you...

49:21.876 --> 49:24.377
...you got nerve to ask me
about my papers.

49:24.545 --> 49:26.880
My family suffered, man,
for lack of potatoes.

49:27.048 --> 49:29.966
Foot-and-mouth disease.
Canker sores. Circumcision.

49:30.134 --> 49:33.053
-Circumcision?
-Right, my wife just had a set of twins.

49:33.220 --> 49:34.971
-Both Ieprechauns.
-Leprechauns?

49:35.139 --> 49:37.932
Get a whiff.
Irish Spring.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.227
You don't believe that,
wipe your ass with a four-leaf cIover.

49:41.395 --> 49:43.438
McGinty!

49:43.606 --> 49:45.231
Get this stuff on the ship.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.830
-Tough, eh?
-That was heavy.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.795
I say we should take a break.

50:22.937 --> 50:24.688
Wait a second.

50:24.897 --> 50:27.273
I smell a rat.

51:03.644 --> 51:06.104
This ring is pure pIatinum.

51:06.272 --> 51:07.939
The HALO rings are titanium.

51:08.441 --> 51:10.525
HALO data chips
shouId be weightless...

51:10.693 --> 51:14.487
...surrounded by a hollow core
that prevents thermal induction.

51:14.655 --> 51:16.990
If the density of the object...

51:17.158 --> 51:22.454
...is less than that of the substance
in which it is immersed....

51:26.125 --> 51:27.625
It floats.

51:29.962 --> 51:32.172
There they are.

51:37.386 --> 51:41.181
I'm sure Helen Zaas was great,
but I just can't imagine Iife...

51:41.348 --> 51:44.142
...without DyIan Sanders.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.815
-Come on, let's get out of here.
-Cheers to that.

51:52.193 --> 51:54.486
What's the rush, Helen?

51:59.283 --> 52:01.618
You've onIy been here five minutes.

52:03.204 --> 52:06.164
Now, I've waited for you before.

52:09.084 --> 52:13.630
Matter of fact,
I've waited for you 2920 days.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.675
That's 41 7 weeks.

52:19.386 --> 52:21.930
That's 96 months.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.600
That's eight years.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.852
Enough about me.

52:28.020 --> 52:30.104
What about you, Helen?
How have you been?

52:30.272 --> 52:32.190
Seamus.

52:32.358 --> 52:35.527
I see you still got a nice arse on you.

52:36.320 --> 52:38.571
You got a lot of nerve
stealing from me.

52:38.739 --> 52:42.200
-Stealing back's more like it.
-Give us the rings.

52:46.372 --> 52:48.373
Give us the rings.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.388
Give us the rings!

53:13.941 --> 53:17.902
Don't lose those.
We'll be taking them back in about...

53:19.572 --> 53:21.781
...48 seconds.

53:24.743 --> 53:28.246
I've been dreaming one day
I'd get to see you again...

53:29.415 --> 53:30.832
...and watch you die.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.167
Keep dreaming.

53:37.798 --> 53:40.592
Lights. Somebody get the lights!

53:41.260 --> 53:43.261
Seamus.

53:44.013 --> 53:48.099
Seamus!

53:49.435 --> 53:51.769
You know I always like it
with the light on.

54:47.826 --> 54:51.621
-You don't know me anymore.
-I'm the only one here who knows you.

55:07.179 --> 55:08.763
Wait, wait, wait!

55:39.461 --> 55:42.296
I've got to say, Helen,
I've never wanted you more.

55:42.464 --> 55:44.590
-Always wanting what you can't have.
-Yeah?

55:51.181 --> 55:53.433
I'Il have you any way I want.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.283
I got the rings.
Let's get out of here!

56:57.915 --> 56:59.791
Don't let them get away!

57:03.837 --> 57:05.046
Got it?

57:21.522 --> 57:22.647
Come on, now!

57:34.660 --> 57:36.369
Let's go.

57:44.378 --> 57:46.379
DyIan, let's go.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.912
You can't hurt me anymore, HeIen.

58:20.372 --> 58:23.082
I'm gonna teach you
and your friends about pain.

58:25.586 --> 58:29.589
I'm gonna kilI them
just so you can hear them scream.

58:33.218 --> 58:35.094
DyIan!

58:36.930 --> 58:39.098
I got the rings.

58:39.933 --> 58:43.060
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.604
Hit it.

59:00.787 --> 59:03.080
I know who did it.

59:04.708 --> 59:08.794
Hot damn it, I know who did it.

59:09.630 --> 59:13.174
Col. Mustard,
in the dining room, with a Iead pipe.

59:13.342 --> 59:14.884
-Col. Mustard?
-Give me that.

59:15.052 --> 59:17.511
-Col. Mustard?
-I said, Col. Mustard...

59:17.679 --> 59:20.181
...in the dining room,
with a lead pipe.

59:20.349 --> 59:23.267
-Go ahead and look in there.
-Why don't you Iook.

59:23.435 --> 59:25.478
Col. Must--

59:25.646 --> 59:27.021
-Col. Mustard?
-Right.

59:27.189 --> 59:30.066
Col. Mustard? Col. Mustard?

59:30.901 --> 59:32.985
It's Professor PIum...

59:33.570 --> 59:36.030
...in the conservatory,
with a candlestick.

59:36.198 --> 59:38.491
That's right. You got it right.

59:38.659 --> 59:40.910
-Damn!
-How the hell you know that?

59:41.078 --> 59:45.331
We took in one just Iike him
a long time ago, remember?

59:45.499 --> 59:49.418
Yeah, Mama, I remember.
You gave my room away.

59:53.674 --> 59:56.592
You were the cock?
I was the beaver.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.387
What are the chances that
we were both mascots?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.806
-UnbelievabIe.
-Oh, God.

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:06.143
It's like we were made for each other.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:11.023
The best I can figure it is,
the cIients contact Charlie directly.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.359
Okay, then he phones the girIs.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:17.363
They show up at the place
and do their thing.

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:20.700
Now, I know, I know.
At first, I didn't think I could handle it.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:26.914
The Iate nights, the never knowing
when she'd have to go out on a job.

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.625
Some of the men
are pretty dangerous.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.628
And the outfits. Oh, boy.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:41.679
I'Il be right back, Pete.
It's just number one. Have fun.

01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:58.529
Hello?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:19.925
I'm gonna say this. Our boy Pete
has no idea what he's getting into.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:24.096
I don't think he reaIly
understands the responsibility.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.766
-No, no.
-Pete?

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:29.685
-The commitment.
-Once they get into your house...

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.729
-...you lose all spontaneity.
-Gone.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.397
They do whatever they want.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:36.025
-Pete's asking her tonight?
-That's what he said.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.823
But Alex is a wildcat.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:46.952
I mean, she gives
as good as she gets.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.288
Alex! Hey.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:52.666
Jason, Daddy.
What are you doing here, Jason?

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:56.545
I was just explaining to your
father here all about Charlie.

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.631
Charlie?

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:03.427
-Daddy....
-It's alI right, Alex. I know.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:05.971
I'm so sorry, Daddy,
that I didn't tell you.

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:10.351
I didn't think you'd approve. I know
you wanted me to be a neurosurgeon.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:15.106
But I've discovered
a whoIe new way to help people...

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:18.317
...that makes me feel so...

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:21.987
...alive.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.408
Whatever makes you happy.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.329
I am so relieved!

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:34.500
It's just been kiIling me,
you not knowing alI these years. I--

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.168
Daddy...

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:39.296
...Natalie, Dylan and I are a team.

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:43.509
And we just took on 12 sailors.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:50.057
You can't even imagine the
positions we get ourselves into.

01:02:50.392 --> 01:02:54.186
Daddy, I wish you couId watch
us work. You'd be so proud.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.689
I'm gonna take a shower...

01:02:56.857 --> 01:03:00.484
...because I am covered in--
WelI, you can only imagine what.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.821
And then when I get back,
I am gonna give you...

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.657
...a fuIl blow-by-blow.

01:03:11.163 --> 01:03:12.329
Ferret.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.474
-Natalie?
-What, Pete?

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.810
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah?

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:38.981
-About what?
-WelI, look...

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.734
...I know we just moved in together.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.819
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:48.157
And I know we agreed
to take this kind of slow.

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:50.659
-But--
-Yeah?

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.455
There's just something I gotta ask.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:59.210
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah. "Oh, boy" is right.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.337
So here it goes.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:03.881
-TwirI me first.
-Okay.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.022
Yeah.

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.029
Hey!

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:12.199
-About that question, Pete?
-Let's talk about it later.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.008
"Here's alI your stuff back."

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:12.468
What's up with that?

01:06:13.261 --> 01:06:15.054
She's gone.

01:06:15.764 --> 01:06:17.848
She's not coming back.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:19.975
She loved these boots.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.686
She doesn't want us to get hurt.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:27.107
Wait a minute,
you ladies risk your ass every day.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:28.525
Yeah.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:31.528
"I'll never forgive myself
if anything happens to you."

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.489
Where do we go from here, Charlie?

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:36.992
Natalie, Alex.
You need to keep your spirits up.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.036
Any leads on the O'Gradys, CharIie?

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.330
Any word on how
Seamus broke out of prison?

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:44.083
He didn't break out, Natalie.
He was released.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:47.586
What? Who would have the power
to pull something like that off?

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:49.922
Johnnie Cochran.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:53.258
The Justice Department,
the DA's office, the FBI.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.011
U.S. Marshal.

01:06:57.847 --> 01:06:59.098
That's Carter.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:08.023
I never gave rings to a guy before.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.442
The rings are secure, sir.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.903
And we can all breathe
a little easier.

01:07:13.071 --> 01:07:16.031
-Well done, Angels.
-Thanks, Charlie.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:18.283
HALO is safe, thanks to you.

01:07:18.451 --> 01:07:20.160
It's been a pleasure.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.996
I hope to work with you ladies again.

01:07:23.498 --> 01:07:24.790
But not too soon.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:27.251
Good luck with everything.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.296
Your keys.

01:07:35.844 --> 01:07:38.137
-What is it?
-My ribs.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.435
These aren't mine.

01:07:49.274 --> 01:07:53.235
That was a nice reach for a guy
with a couple of fractured ribs.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.487
Good going, Bos.

01:07:55.655 --> 01:07:57.781
-We got him.
-We got who?

01:07:57.949 --> 01:08:01.910
Of course, he already had one ring.
He just needed the other.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:05.372
He wanted to fake his own death
so he wouldn't be a suspect.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.166
Who you alI talking about?

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.543
He needed time for his pIan,
so he set up Seamus.

01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:11.295
Then turned him loose on Dylan.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:13.464
i think you're onto something,
Angels.

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:16.759
Damn! So Carter's the bad guy!

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:21.596
It's just speculation at this point,
Bosley. We need proof.

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.557
-Keys, BosIey.
-Let's hit it.

01:08:23.725 --> 01:08:25.225
Punk.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.331
Road's clear.
You're good to move in.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:54.462
Almost there.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.383
Oncoming.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:10.562
Good job, Alex.

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:16.944
-Can we go yet?
-No, you can't, son.

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:18.569
I gotta make sure it's safe.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:21.823
-We're gonna be late.
-You're not gonna be late, young ma--

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.242
You old grizzly bear!

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.493
Son, please work with me, young man.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:29.247
A few more minutes and you'll be
in school. You'll never see me again.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:32.751
Man, you do not mess
with a black man's do!

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.550
I got the phone line.

01:09:45.765 --> 01:09:47.599
I'm caIling from my car.
Go secure.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.772
My end of the deal's done.
The Angels are off the case.

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:56.358
I have the rings.

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:58.694
DyIan.

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.743
Alex! Alex!

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.537
Call buyer one.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:09.955
Alex, are you okay?

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.624
Nat, the handle's broken.
I can't disengage.

01:10:12.876 --> 01:10:15.627
The deal's on. Eight o'clock,
just as we discussed.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:17.629
-Nat, pIan B!
-I'm caIling in Bosley.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:20.424
We'll get you out of there, Alex.
Hang tight.

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.594
Follow the stars beyond the galaxy.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:28.599
Take shore to hope.
Stop on a stair.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.142
A stair?

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:31.977
Find a man with a map.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.645
Bosley, can you hear me?

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:37.149
Bosley, we're going
to Bravo configuration immediately.

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:38.984
I'm on it. I'm on it. Okay?

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:42.404
Now, get back. We're going
to Bravo configuration. Get back!

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:49.244
Stop!

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:00.756
-Come on.
-Okay. Come on, hurry.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.926
Skip. Run.

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:09.681
Get on out of here.

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.517
Come on. Get on out of here.

01:11:18.942 --> 01:11:22.110
-Great job, Bos.
-Yeah, right.

01:11:22.403 --> 01:11:25.739
Carter's working with a partner.
They're selling the list tonight.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:28.200
We'll take care of them
and then find DyIan.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.453
-See you, Bos.
-Yeah, alI right, alI right.

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:36.166
This is some bullshit.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:24.172
-Kelly Garrett.
-Hello, Dylan.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.842
Don't you have a case to soIve?

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:33.348
WelI, I tried to outrun my past,
but it caught up with me yesterday.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:35.517
And I put my friends in danger.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:38.645
They're in more danger now
without you.

01:12:39.731 --> 01:12:42.941
Natalie and Alex are gonna
replace me with someone great.

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:47.779
A real Angel. Not someone who's
pretending to be something she's not.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:51.658
Your past is what makes you
who you are, Dylan.

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:55.328
Don't forget that CharIie chose you
for a reason.

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.457
AngeIs are like diamonds.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:01.585
They can't be made.
You have to find them.

01:13:03.504 --> 01:13:05.672
Each one is unique.

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:13.930
Sometimes we search too hard
for answers that are right in front of us.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.918
The buyers are set.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:27.379
We did it, partner!

01:14:57.785 --> 01:15:00.328
You know, I never really got
that partner thing.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:13.800
Hello, AngeIs.

01:15:14.802 --> 01:15:16.094
Madison Lee.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:18.638
Why?

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:21.016
Why be an Angel
when I can play God?

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:25.979
Looks like one of the three
amigos has gone adiÃ³s.

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:45.290
Welcome back, DyIan.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.918
You're such
a typical rebellious Pisces.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.212
Always out to prove
how tough you are...

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:53.340
...and you couIdn't make it
one day on your own, could you?

01:15:53.507 --> 01:15:57.510
Someone reminded me
that every Angel is unique.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.679
And I knew it was you.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.973
Who else had contacts in Mongolia...

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:05.644
...could hack the HALO fail-safe
and hire a surfer as an assassin?

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:09.022
Same astrological phenom who would
refer to a motocross rider...

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.858
...with a lion on his helmet as "Leo."

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:17.656
Very well done.

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:20.450
Very impressive, really.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.870
You've got it all figured out.

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:27.999
And now I'm gonna really enjoy...

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.961
...knocking those halos right
off your heads.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.421
But you're an Angel.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.424
No. You just don't get it.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:40.387
I don't take orders
from a speaker box anymore.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:42.722
I work for myself.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:45.600
WelI, your boss sucks.

01:16:48.062 --> 01:16:50.480
The Angels' ass-kicking pose.

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.482
Seeing the three of you like that...

01:16:52.650 --> 01:16:57.279
...does give me this little twinge
of nostalgia for the oId days.

01:16:57.738 --> 01:17:00.031
But back then,
it was a IittIe bit different.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.201
You see, when I was an Angel...

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:05.495
...we used guns.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.813
Sorry, Charlie.

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.009
Hello, Angels.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.095
Good evening, Charlie.

01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:06.056
I love the new office.

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.808
Madison, is that you?
Where are the Angels?

01:18:08.976 --> 01:18:11.561
I'm sure there's three more
where they came from.

01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:14.147
Madison, what have you done?

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:19.319
We're just having a little fun.
You shouldn't worry yourseIf, Charlie.

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.154
You've never had trouble...

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:23.740
...finding someone
to give their life for you.

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:28.703
Hurting the Angels doesn't prove
you're the best. You know that.

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:30.121
Do I?

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:33.333
Madison, you were never able
to accept that this agency...

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:36.336
...is about teamwork.
We're a family. We do--

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:40.632
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
AngeIs forever.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.468
I've heard the saIes pitch.

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.765
It was very seductive...

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.851
...once.

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:55.772
Madison, you deliberately went
rogue on the DeSoto case...

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:59.317
...and put your fellow Angels
in danger.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:01.403
When we finally got you
out of there...

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:05.407
...you were wounded so badly,
we thought we might lose you.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.992
You did Iose me.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.579
You see, being an Angel
wasn't fulfilling my destiny.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:14.124
It was keeping me from it.

01:19:14.291 --> 01:19:16.793
Your destiny is yet to be written.

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:19.170
Do not do this, Madison.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:23.591
Taking the lives of innocent people
is not the answer.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:27.804
There must be something
in you that's still good.

01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:38.314
I was never good.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:44.237
I was great.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:13.641
Damn. What a bitch!

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:40.126
You guys,
we have to outthink Madison.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:43.254
No matter what we do,
she's always two steps ahead of us.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.716
-She's selling the list off tonight, 8:00.
-But where?

01:20:46.884 --> 01:20:49.302
-Nat, what else did Carter say?
-Okay.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:51.888
"Take the stars beyond the gaIaxy."

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:53.890
It's safe to say
it's on this pIanet.

01:20:54.058 --> 01:20:58.770
"Take shore to hope
and stop on a stair."

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.399
-There's a Hope Street downtown.
-But no shore for miIes.

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:05.610
A stair.

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:09.155
Astaire!

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.534
Astaire?

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:13.993
Astaire!

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:16.162
-Possible concussion.
-I'm worried.

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:20.124
Guys, the stars.
Hollywood Walk of Fame.

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:23.336
Beyond the Galaxy Theatre.

01:21:23.504 --> 01:21:26.673
There's Dinah Shore, Bob Hope
and Fred Astaire.

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:29.342
-Nice, Nat.
-Yeah!

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.481
I think she's trying to kill us.

01:22:05.379 --> 01:22:07.797
I can't believe it.
We are here in HoIlywood.

01:22:07.965 --> 01:22:09.841
-AngeIs?
-I knew we were gonna do it--

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.342
-Shut up, damn it!
-What?

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.052
I mean, not you, Mama. Sorry.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.556
-Have you Iost your mind?
-Yeah. I mean, no.

01:22:16.724 --> 01:22:18.308
We gonna talk about this later.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:45.960
-Welcome to the Guinness World of--
-Shut it.

01:22:46.253 --> 01:22:48.004
Give us the map.

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:35.843
Yahtzee!

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.477
Jason! Jason!

01:23:45.604 --> 01:23:46.646
Jason!

01:23:47.481 --> 01:23:49.440
I love you!

01:23:55.239 --> 01:23:57.907
-I hear the sequel's insane.
-First one was a classic.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:23:59.117
Button your jacket.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.618
-What?
-Button your jacket.

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.871
The VIP gathering is on the top floor.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:50.061
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to obstruct justice.

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:51.938
Freeze!

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.532
The KIeinhardt gambit.

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.870
-CIassic.
-And apparently still effective.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.173
We never used to wear Kevlar
tilI I took three in the chest.

01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:04.510
On the DeSoto case! We know!

01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:11.726
Don't tell me you forgot about...

01:27:12.144 --> 01:27:14.312
...plan B.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.570
I'd recognize that arse anywhere,
you piece of sh--!

01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:33.706
Bring it on, bitch.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.554
Say something.

01:29:20.564 --> 01:29:22.857
Mind if I cut in?

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.817
No!

01:30:47.192 --> 01:30:49.318
The premiere should be a blast.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:06.669
Bosley, plan B!

01:31:06.837 --> 01:31:08.295
It's raining white women!

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:17.680
Plan B stands for "plan Bosley."

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:24.687
Yeah!

01:31:25.522 --> 01:31:28.190
Get that bitch! Get that bitch!

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:32.695
Wow. They really went
all out for this thing. Okay!

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:21.827
DyIan!

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:29.293
Alex!

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:51.125
This is it. You ready?

01:33:52.794 --> 01:33:54.420
Are you?

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.519
KiIl...

01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.771
...or be kilIed.

01:34:13.231 --> 01:34:15.149
Exciting, isn't it?

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:17.776
Who are you?

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:22.406
You want to know who I am, Natalie?

01:34:23.241 --> 01:34:25.326
Then you look inside your own heart.

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:27.995
No, Madison.

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.164
I'm nothing like you.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.667
I have something you'Il never have.

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.887
And what's that?

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.018
Friends.

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:23.467
-Enjoy heaven.
-Go to hell.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:00.295
She is so fired.

01:36:16.104 --> 01:36:17.855
Party time.

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:29.366
-AngeIs!
-Bosley!

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.368
AngeIs!

01:36:33.371 --> 01:36:35.664
-You alI get that squirrel-flying lady?
-Yeah!

01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:37.207
-Did you scratch her?
-Yeah!

01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:41.128
You kick her? You kicked her
kung fu ass? Mama, I told you!

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:42.713
I know it!

01:36:42.964 --> 01:36:46.300
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Never!

01:36:46.634 --> 01:36:48.385
-You hear that, Mama?
-I heard it.

01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:51.597
I've always known
my baby boy was a genius!

01:36:51.764 --> 01:36:53.932
Why you give my room
away, then, Mama?

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.019
I'Il tell you why. Max?

01:36:57.187 --> 01:36:59.480
Yeah? I'm a Bosley now!

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:02.524
-Max Bosley!
-I love Max Bosley!

01:37:02.692 --> 01:37:04.651
-Boy, you did it!
-Hallelujah!

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:07.321
Daddy! One second. Daddy!

01:37:07.489 --> 01:37:09.948
Darling! You made it!

01:37:10.116 --> 01:37:14.328
We just got done.
Another satisfied client.

01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:16.955
We finished her off
sooner than we thought.

01:37:17.123 --> 01:37:18.790
-Her?
-It was a woman this time.

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:22.169
We had to triple-team her,
but we finally got her on her back!

01:37:24.964 --> 01:37:26.882
WelI done!

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:29.343
No, no, no!

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:35.349
-Jason!
-Alex. You made it.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.645
No, no, no! I know.
We're on a time-out, I know.

01:37:39.812 --> 01:37:44.024
Time-out's over, baby.
We're back in the game!

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:52.407
Ferret.

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:07.506
I know you wanted to wait
and everything, but--

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:14.805
-You reaIly look beautiful.
-Thanks, Pete.

01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:18.058
I've been wanting to ask you this
for a long time.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:20.894
So here goes.

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:23.647
Pete.

01:38:35.577 --> 01:38:38.495
-Spike?
-Yeah. A puppy.

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:40.581
A puppy?

01:38:40.748 --> 01:38:43.834
-Is that okay? I know it's a big step.
-Yes!

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:45.544
I already got him.

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:47.921
-You did?
-Yeah.

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:54.386
DyIan! Dylan!

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.388
Guess what.

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:58.432
Pete and I have something
to telI you.

01:38:58.600 --> 01:38:59.933
-Really?
-We're gonna get--

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:03.687
-You're gonna get what?
-A puppy!

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.315
-A puppy! That's great!
-Yes.

01:39:06.482 --> 01:39:08.317
-I already got him.
-You did.

01:39:08.484 --> 01:39:10.819
-Awesome!
-His name is Spike!

01:39:11.112 --> 01:39:14.448
-So you're not leaving?
-No! Of course, you guys.

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:18.660
I get to kick butt with my two best
friends. You think I'd give that up?

01:39:18.828 --> 01:39:20.787
No!

01:39:21.122 --> 01:39:22.497
What about you, DyIan?

01:39:22.665 --> 01:39:25.208
With O'Grady out,
you can go back to your old life.

01:39:25.376 --> 01:39:28.420
Are you kidding? This is my life.

01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:32.341
-What about you, neurosurgeon?
-It's a no-brainer!

01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:36.762
I love our family!

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:55.822
God!

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:03.372
And I know we agreed
to take things slow.

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:06.667
-Yeah?
-But....

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:08.502
-You--
-Sorry.

01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:19.846
There's an ember in my ass.

01:40:26.813 --> 01:40:29.106
We should get this to the lab
and analyze it.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:31.191
Yeah, just crawl right up in there.

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:33.026
I have.

01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:44.705
I like the patch.

01:40:46.958 --> 01:40:48.875
Let me see your patch.

01:40:57.093 --> 01:40:58.802
Hello?

01:41:00.304 --> 01:41:01.722
Is this NataIie?

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.140
Okay!

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:09.062
I'm on fire!

01:41:17.572 --> 01:41:19.156
Look around.

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:20.907
Over your right shoulder.

01:41:21.075 --> 01:41:23.368
Is somebody coming up behind me?

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:45.065
I am getting peIted.

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:47.025
Pelted by the--

01:46:47.193 --> 01:46:50.236
-I literally--
-I have it in--
