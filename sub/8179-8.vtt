00:36.368 --> 00:37.501
DOUGHNUT.

00:37.569 --> 00:39.871
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
EATING CARBS.

00:39.939 --> 00:43.391
I'M NOW ALLOWING MYSELF
TO EAT DELICIOUS CARBS.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.527
HEY, YOU GOT A LITTLE JELLY

00:45.594 --> 00:48.462
YEAH. YEAH, THERE'S SOME

YEAH, HOW'D YOU GET JELLY
ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK?

00:53.135 --> 00:55.770
THERE WAS
A BEE IN THE CAR.

01:00.375 --> 01:02.043
WHAT'S THAT?

01:02.110 --> 01:03.578
A KOOSH BALL.
OH.

01:03.646 --> 01:04.712
HEY, HEY,

01:04.780 --> 01:05.813

01:05.881 --> 01:06.881
WHY?

01:06.949 --> 01:07.982
WHY?
GIVE-GIVE IT TO ME.

01:08.050 --> 01:09.751
I SAID GIVE IT TO ME!

01:09.818 --> 01:10.785
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
TAKE IT EASY.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.153
IT'S JUST A BALL.

01:12.220 --> 01:15.924
LOOK, MY KID GAVE THIS TO ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY LAST NIGHT.

01:15.991 --> 01:17.058
IT WAS REALLY AMAZING.

01:17.125 --> 01:19.827
4 YEARS OLD, HE GOT
THE IDEA ALL BY HIMSELF,

01:19.895 --> 01:22.430
EMPTIED OUT HIS PIGGY BANK,
AND BOUGHT DADDY A PRESENT.

01:22.497 --> 01:25.600
YOUR BIRTHDAY. RIGHT.

01:27.536 --> 01:29.837
DID HE MENTION THAT WAS
FROM BOTH OF US OR-

01:29.905 --> 01:32.807
LOOK, I GOTTA
PICK UP MY ROUTE, GUY.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.042
I'M SERIOUS.
DON'T TOUCH MY KOOSH.

01:34.109 --> 01:35.643
OOH.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.481
OH, I'M TOUCHING IT.

01:40.549 --> 01:42.183
I'M TOUCHING IT
ALL OVER.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.184
HEY.

01:43.251 --> 01:44.552
HEY. YES, SIR?
HEFFERNAN.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.254
YOU GOTTA GET ALL THE TRASH
OUT OF YOUR TRUCK BY THURSDAY.

01:47.322 --> 01:48.522
I'M GIVING YOU
A HEAD START NOW,

01:48.591 --> 01:52.293
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN
YOUR TACO BELL GRAVEYARD.

01:52.360 --> 01:53.878
HOO-HOO!

01:53.946 --> 01:56.447
UM, WHAT'S HAPPENING
THURSDAY?

01:56.515 --> 01:59.133
OH, SOME BIG GUY COMING
FROM THE NORTHEAST OFFICE

01:59.201 --> 02:01.369
TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP UP
THE I.P.S. IMAGE,

02:01.437 --> 02:02.938
SUCH AS IT IS.

02:03.005 --> 02:04.389
ANYWAY,
CLEAN OUT YOUR TRUCK,

02:04.456 --> 02:07.208
AND NO MORE DUMB-ASS
STUNTS LIKE LAST MONTH.

02:07.275 --> 02:08.710
DON'T WORRY. YOU WON'T
EVEN KNOW I'M THERE.

02:08.776 --> 02:12.246
IN FACT, IF YOU WANT, I
COULD JUST STAY HOME THAT DAY.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.806
HAA!

02:26.612 --> 02:27.745
OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.

02:27.813 --> 02:31.749
"PROPERTY OF MR. KAPLAN.
DO NOT TOUCH."

02:31.817 --> 02:35.987
DIDN'T THE GUY JUST BUY A $12
MILLION HOUSE IN THE HAMPTONS?

02:36.055 --> 02:39.324
YOU THINK HE CAN THROW THE
SUPPORT STAFF A SQUIRT OF HAZELNUT,

02:39.392 --> 02:42.060
YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING?

02:45.531 --> 02:48.333
HE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME,
ISN'T HE?

02:48.401 --> 02:50.368
SORRY.
WE'RE JUST FREAKED OUT.

02:50.436 --> 02:52.136
IT'S BEEN GOING AROUND

02:52.205 --> 02:54.206
THAT SINCE THE FIRM DIDN'T
DO SO GREAT THIS YEAR,

02:54.273 --> 02:56.241
THERE'S GONNA
BE SOME LAYOFFS.

02:56.309 --> 02:57.275
REALLY?
YEAH.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.143
ELAINE
WHO WORKS UPSTAIRS SAID

02:59.212 --> 03:00.445
SHE HEARD
THE SENIOR PARTNERS TALKING

03:00.513 --> 03:02.614
ABOUT GETTING RID
OF THE DEADWOOD.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.849
SECRETARIES
OR JUST LAWYERS?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.084
WELL,
IF THEY FIRE YOUR BOSS,

03:06.151 --> 03:07.785
WHY WOULD THEY
KEEP YOU AROUND?

03:09.688 --> 03:11.956
WHO LEFT MR. KAPLAN'S
HAZELNUT OUT?

03:15.694 --> 03:17.295
CARRIE.
YEAH?

03:17.363 --> 03:18.430
TYPE THIS UP FOR ME,
WILL YOU?

03:18.497 --> 03:19.864
UH, YES. MR. PRUZAN-

03:19.932 --> 03:23.868
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE FANCY
FOR CASUAL FRIDAY, AREN'T YOU?

03:23.936 --> 03:25.603
OK, A COUPLE THINGS.

03:25.671 --> 03:27.605
UM, THEY CANCELED THAT
A FEW WEEKS AGO,

03:27.673 --> 03:29.674
AND IT'S TUESDAY.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.428
MR. PRUZAN, CAN I
ASK YOU A QUESTION?

03:33.496 --> 03:35.230
I KNOW THE FIRM
IS DOWNSIZING, AND-

03:35.297 --> 03:36.498
WHAT?!

03:36.565 --> 03:37.865
YEAH, SOMETHING ABOUT
GETTING RID OF THE DEADWOOD.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.334
DEADWOOD?!

03:39.402 --> 03:41.903
DID THEY SAY DEADWOOD?

03:41.971 --> 03:43.053
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY SAID EXACTLY.

03:43.121 --> 03:44.039
CARRIE, I SPECIFICALLY
NEED TO KNOW

03:44.106 --> 03:46.424
IF THEY USED THE TERM
"DEADWOOD."

03:46.492 --> 03:49.661
WE'RE IN TROUBLE,
AREN'T WE?

04:05.127 --> 04:08.846
WHY DOES O'BOYLE
HAVE MY KOOSH?

04:08.914 --> 04:10.915
DOES HE?

04:10.983 --> 04:13.884
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT HE WENT
INTO OUR LOCKERS AND TOOK STUFF.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.071
I'M SERIOUS. ONE DAY MY
UNIFORM SMELLED LIKE HE WORE IT.

04:17.139 --> 04:19.624
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
I TOLD YOU TO LAY OFF OF IT!

04:19.690 --> 04:21.625
BUT THEN O'BOYLE WALKED
BY AND SAID, "HOO-HOO!"

04:21.692 --> 04:23.128
AND I HAD TO THROW IT TO HIM. WHY?!

04:23.195 --> 04:24.362
THAT'S CATCH ETIQUETTE.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.363
WHEN SOMEONE GOES,
"HOO-HOO,"

04:25.431 --> 04:26.797
YOU GOTTA THROW THEM
THE BALL.

04:26.865 --> 04:28.733
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. JUST
GO IN THERE AND GET IT BACK!

04:28.800 --> 04:30.401
NOT A GREAT TIME
FOR THAT.

04:30.469 --> 04:31.436
WHY?

04:31.504 --> 04:34.005
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW
LAST MONTH AS A JOKE

04:34.072 --> 04:35.240
I FILLED OUT
THAT TIMECARD

04:35.307 --> 04:38.276
FOR ONE
MR. FOGHORN LEGHORN?

04:38.344 --> 04:40.845
YEAH.
THAT WAS A CLASSIC.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.347
ANYWAY, TURNS OUT
THE GUYS IN ACCOUNTING

04:43.415 --> 04:44.549
CUT HIM
QUITE A FEW PAYCHECKS

04:44.616 --> 04:47.952
BEFORE THEY REALIZED
HE'S A CARTOON ROOSTER.

04:48.137 --> 04:50.905
O'BOYLE FOUND OUT AND MADE
SOME PRETTY SERIOUS THREATS

04:50.973 --> 04:53.374
INVOLVING HIS THERMOS
AND MY ASS.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.931
WHY HE'D WANT TO USE HIS
OWN THERMOS, I DON'T KNOW. I-

05:03.235 --> 05:05.136
YOU'RE GONNA BE
WISHING FOR A THERMOS

05:05.204 --> 05:06.137
WHEN I GET DONE WITH YOU,

05:06.205 --> 05:07.572
NOW GET IN THERE!

05:07.640 --> 05:08.573
ALL RIGHT.

05:12.344 --> 05:13.411
HELLO?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.779
HEY, IT'S ME.
I'M REALLY UPSET.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.781
EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HOW
THERE MIGHT BE SOME LAYOFFS,

05:17.849 --> 05:21.819
AND I THINK
- I THINK PRUZAN'S GONNA BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO GO.

05:21.887 --> 05:23.321
YEAH. UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.423
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO
ANY WORK AT ALL THIS MORNING.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.791
I'M JUST SITTING HERE
FEELING NAUSEOUS. GO!

05:27.859 --> 05:29.027
HE'S COMING!

05:29.094 --> 05:30.995
JUST GONNA HAVE
A WATER/PHONE BREAK.

05:31.063 --> 05:34.865
GONNA GET A LITTLE WATER
AND PHONE.

05:34.933 --> 05:36.934
I GOTTA GO.

05:37.002 --> 05:38.803
OK. LOVE YOU.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.004
HEY, WE'LL GET IT!

05:40.072 --> 05:41.305
COME ON, MAN. DON'T
WORRY. WE'LL GET-

05:41.374 --> 05:42.440
HEY, THAT'S
THE MEAN FINGER.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.809
WELL, I TALKED
TO THE PARTNERS.

05:45.877 --> 05:47.945
WE REALLY
CLEARED THE AIR.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.264
APPARENTLY
I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE ON

05:50.332 --> 05:51.933
AND PURSUE
OTHER INTERESTS.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.268
OH, MY GOD.

05:54.336 --> 05:55.586
NEXT ISSUE...

05:55.755 --> 05:58.256
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE VARIOUS
LEVELS OF GOOD-BYE PARTIES HERE?

05:58.323 --> 06:00.775
THE PEOPLE THEY HATE
GET A CARD.

06:00.926 --> 06:02.794
THE PEOPLE THEY LIKE
GET ICE-CREAM CAKE.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.546
THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE
GET A FULL OMELET BAR.

06:05.613 --> 06:08.082
I WANT TO GO OUT WITH
THE OMELET BAR, CARRIE,

06:08.150 --> 06:10.551
WITH THE MAN
IN THE CHEF'S HAT.

06:10.618 --> 06:12.619
I WANNA SEE THAT HAT.

06:12.687 --> 06:14.972
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

06:26.068 --> 06:28.136
YEAH. MM-HMM.

06:28.203 --> 06:29.803
MR. O'BOYLE,
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

06:29.871 --> 06:33.474
YES. NO, WE'RE ALL SET
FOR YOUR REVIEW.

06:33.541 --> 06:36.060
THINK YOU'RE GONNA LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE, MR. HALLIBURTON.

06:39.164 --> 06:41.866
OK, GREAT.
WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.301
YEAH.

06:43.368 --> 06:47.188
OH, I'LL BE SO GLAD WHEN
THIS DOUCHE IS OUT OF MY LIFE.

06:47.389 --> 06:48.472
WHAT'S UP?

06:48.540 --> 06:50.842
ACTUALLY, I JUST HAD
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

06:50.909 --> 06:52.911
WHAT?
UH, ABOUT THE REVIEW,

06:52.978 --> 06:55.513
UM, SHOULD WE
WEAR SHORTS THAT DAY?

06:55.580 --> 06:57.348
OR GO WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE OF A FORMAL LOOK

06:57.416 --> 06:59.400
WITH THE LONGER-
HOO-HOO!

06:59.467 --> 07:00.852
I DON'T CARE.
EITHER ONE.

07:06.575 --> 07:08.976
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW,
SHORTS IS ONE WAY TO GO,

07:09.044 --> 07:10.812
BUT IF YOU GO WITH THE-
WITCHACATAA!

07:16.551 --> 07:18.602
HELLO.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.905
YEAH, HEY, LOU.

07:20.973 --> 07:24.241
UH-HUH. HMM.

07:24.309 --> 07:25.677
ZIGGATOWW!

07:28.147 --> 07:31.416
WHAT?
BUP-BUP-BUP-BUP!

07:31.483 --> 07:35.570
NO, TELL THE I.R.S. WE'RE NOT
TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM THEM.

07:35.637 --> 07:38.806
THERE IS NO FOGHORN LEGHORN
WHO WORKS HERE.

07:40.559 --> 07:43.744
NO, IT-IT WAS JUST A BAD JOKE
BY ONE OF OUR MORON DRIVERS

07:43.812 --> 07:46.347
WHO HAPPENS TO BE STANDING
RIGHT HERE NOW BOTHERING ME.

07:46.414 --> 07:48.182
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
GOOD-BYE.

07:48.250 --> 07:51.085
WELL, TURNS OUT
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

07:51.153 --> 07:53.905
DIDN'T THINK YOUR PRANK
WAS VERY FUNNY EITHER.

07:53.972 --> 07:57.724
OH, AND THEY'RE
SO HILARIOUS?

07:57.792 --> 07:59.210
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE

07:59.278 --> 08:02.596
FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY FOCUS
ONE DAY HERE ON YOUR JOB

08:02.664 --> 08:06.517
INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE A
MASSIVELY OVERWEIGHT 4- YEAR-OLD?

08:06.585 --> 08:08.887
I CAN CERTAINLY TRY.

08:08.954 --> 08:10.488
HEFFERNAN.
YEAH?

08:10.556 --> 08:12.289
HOO-HOO!

08:12.357 --> 08:14.909
HMM?

08:14.977 --> 08:17.911
HOO HOO.

08:33.144 --> 08:36.280
HEY, BABE.
I JUST PUT IN 8 FISH STICKS,

08:36.347 --> 08:37.581
AND I COULD PUT IN MORE,

08:37.649 --> 08:40.518
SO I'M GONNA NEED TO KNOW
FROM YOU VERY REALISTICALLY

08:40.585 --> 08:42.720
IF YOU'RE GONNA WANT ONE.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.488
'CAUSE THERE
CAN'T BE ANY OF THIS

08:44.556 --> 08:45.489
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE BITE?

08:45.557 --> 08:47.558
NO.

08:47.626 --> 08:50.111
YOU'RE IN,
OR YOU'RE OUT, OK?

08:50.178 --> 08:51.411
DON'T JERK ME AROUND.

08:51.479 --> 08:53.297
I THINK IT'S HAPPENING.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.899
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
SHOULD I BANG IT UP TO 12?

08:54.966 --> 08:56.034
NO.

08:56.101 --> 08:57.951
I'M TALKING ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON AT WORK.

08:59.888 --> 09:04.225
OH, RIGHT.
THE, UH, BIG CASE?

09:04.292 --> 09:05.693
NO, YOU IDIOT!

09:05.761 --> 09:07.862
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THAT I MIGHT GET FIRED!

09:07.929 --> 09:09.397
WHAT?!
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WHAT"?!

09:09.464 --> 09:11.499
I CALLED YOU FROM WORK
IN A PANIC!

09:11.566 --> 09:13.701
YOU KNOW I TUNE YOU OUT!

09:13.768 --> 09:16.037
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU MIGHT GET FIRED?!

09:16.105 --> 09:18.973
WELL, THEY'RE FIRING PRUZAN
BECAUSE THEY REALIZED HE'S AN IDIOT

09:19.041 --> 09:21.309
AND HE ISN'T ANYBODY'S NEPHEW.

09:21.377 --> 09:23.861
AND IF THEY FIRE HIM, I DON'T
THINK THERE'S A PLACE FOR ME.

09:23.929 --> 09:24.929
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:24.996 --> 09:27.998
I TOLD YOU
TO DRESS SLUTTIER!

09:28.066 --> 09:32.186
THANK YOU, DOUG.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

09:32.254 --> 09:32.971
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

09:33.038 --> 09:34.055
I MEAN,
THIS IS YOUR JOB!

09:34.122 --> 09:35.122
I MEAN,
THIS IS HALF OUR INCOME!

09:35.190 --> 09:37.124
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU REALLY SUCK

09:37.192 --> 09:39.093
AT MAKING ME FEEL BETTER,
YOU KNOW THAT?!

09:39.161 --> 09:41.562
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

09:41.630 --> 09:45.033
I WANT YOU TO SAY THAT
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

09:45.100 --> 09:47.235
EVERYTHING'S...

09:47.302 --> 09:49.703
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

09:49.771 --> 09:52.222
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AT
ALL! I DON'T BLAME YOU!

09:53.424 --> 09:57.595
I AM REALLY SCARED
ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

10:08.323 --> 10:12.126
AWKWARD
FISH STICK TIMING.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.794
JUST GET 'EM.
NO.

10:13.861 --> 10:16.047
THEY'RE BETTER
IF THEY SIT ANYWAY.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.182
COME HERE, WOULD YOU? JUST COME HERE.

10:18.249 --> 10:20.151
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
HELL'S GOING ON OVER THERE,

10:20.218 --> 10:23.453
BUT THEY'D BE CRAZY TO
LET SOMEONE LIKE YOU GO.

10:23.521 --> 10:26.824
AND IF FOR SOME REASON
THEY DO, WELL,

10:26.892 --> 10:29.093
WE'LL FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.227
YEAH?
OK?

10:30.295 --> 10:32.629
YES. WOULD YOU PUT DOWN
THE SLURPEE STRAW?

10:32.698 --> 10:34.132
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

10:34.199 --> 10:36.534
WELL, JUST IN CASE,
DON'T DO ANYTHING

10:36.601 --> 10:38.436
TO SCREW UP
YOUR JOB, OK?

10:46.177 --> 10:50.264
YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING TO
SCREW UP YOUR JOB, AREN'T YOU?

10:53.335 --> 10:55.519
HEY, HEY!
SOMEBODY'S DAY

10:55.587 --> 10:58.089
JUST GOT A LITTLE MORE
KOOSHERIFIC.

11:00.108 --> 11:01.809
I DON'T WANT ANY OF THOSE.

11:01.877 --> 11:02.877
LET ME FINISH.

11:02.944 --> 11:05.679
I ALSO GOT YOU
A WATER PISTOL,

11:05.747 --> 11:07.948
AN EGG FULL
OF GLOW-IN-THE-DARK GOO,

11:08.016 --> 11:10.951
AND A TINY
MATT DAMON BOOK.

11:11.019 --> 11:12.586
HOW MANY TIMES
DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

11:12.654 --> 11:14.388
I WANT THE KOOSH
MY SON BOUGHT FOR ME.

11:14.455 --> 11:15.455
OK, WE GET IT!

11:15.523 --> 11:18.125
YOUR KID HAD $1.60 ONCE.
CAN WE MOVE ON?

11:18.193 --> 11:20.528
NO! YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.097
I GOT HOME, AND THE FIRST
THING MY SON SAID TO ME WAS,

11:23.165 --> 11:24.465
"WHERE'S YOUR
KOOSH BALL, DADDY?

11:24.533 --> 11:25.733
DON'T YOU LOVE IT
ANYMORE?"

11:25.800 --> 11:27.768
I TOLD HIM
I WAS HAVING IT CLEANED.

11:27.836 --> 11:29.170
NICE ONE.

11:29.238 --> 11:30.671
THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE

11:30.739 --> 11:32.673
I EVER LIED TO MY CHILD.
I CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

11:32.741 --> 11:34.041
LOOK, O'BOYLE'S
OUT WITH THAT GUY.

11:34.109 --> 11:35.042
WE STOLE THE KEY.

11:35.110 --> 11:37.145
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE
LIKE WE PLANNED.

11:37.212 --> 11:38.446
YEAH,
I- I CAN'T DO THAT.

11:38.514 --> 11:39.647
WHY NOT?!

11:39.714 --> 11:41.449
CARRIE MIGHT BE
LOSING HER JOB.

11:41.517 --> 11:43.083
REALLY?
YEAH. AND...

11:43.152 --> 11:45.119
THAT WOULD LEAVE US
WITH ONLY ONE PAYCHECK,

11:45.187 --> 11:46.220
WHICH IS
TERRIFYING ENOUGH,

11:46.288 --> 11:47.655
BUT IF I
GET CAUGHT IN THERE,

11:47.722 --> 11:48.956
WE'RE DOWN
TO NO PAYCHECKS,

11:49.024 --> 11:50.324
AND I
CAN'T LIVE ON THAT.

11:50.392 --> 11:53.694
BUT-WHAT-
HE'S NOT GONNA FIRE YOU.

11:53.762 --> 11:55.129
HE MIGHT!

11:55.197 --> 11:57.765
HE FIRED MARTINEZ 'CAUSE HE
WOULDN'T SAY, "FREEDOM FRIES."

11:57.832 --> 11:59.066
ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:59.134 --> 12:02.002
JUST-JUST GIVE ME
THE KEY.

12:02.070 --> 12:03.371
GIVE ME THE KEY.
I'LL GO IN THERE.

12:03.438 --> 12:04.539
I CAN'T
DO THAT EITHER.

12:04.606 --> 12:06.040
WHAT?
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE

12:06.107 --> 12:07.875
WHO THREW HIM THE KOOSH
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:07.942 --> 12:08.876
OK, HE'LL KNOW
I'M INVOLVED.

12:08.943 --> 12:10.511
YOU REALLY NEED
TO LET THIS GO.

12:10.579 --> 12:12.012
GIVE ME THE KEY.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.148
NO.
I SAID GIVE IT.

12:14.216 --> 12:16.050
AND I SAID, "NO."

12:16.117 --> 12:19.137
OH, MY GOD!

12:19.204 --> 12:20.270
LEFT POCKET.

12:20.338 --> 12:21.872
THANK YOU.

12:26.411 --> 12:29.279
Hurry up.

12:33.584 --> 12:34.868
IT'S NOT IN HERE.

12:34.936 --> 12:36.103
WHAT?!

12:36.170 --> 12:37.404
IT'S GONE!

12:42.126 --> 12:43.126
YOU THINK
HE WEARS THAT?

12:47.298 --> 12:51.168
THAT'S PRETTY SPARKLY
FOR A DUDE.

13:01.179 --> 13:03.113
BETTY, HI.
HI, CARRIE.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.748
WHAT CAN WE DO
FOR YOU UP HERE?

13:04.816 --> 13:07.084
OH, I JUST HAVE A FED-EX
FOR MR. LEVY.

13:07.152 --> 13:08.852
COME IN.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.204
MR. LEVY, HI.

13:11.273 --> 13:14.241
I'M CARRIE HEFFERNAN. I WORK
FOR MR. PRUZAN DOWNSTAIRS.

13:14.309 --> 13:16.510
I HAVE A-
A FED-EX FOR YOU.

13:16.578 --> 13:18.862
DOESN'T THE MAIL ROOM
USUALLY BRING THOSE AROUND?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.664
YES. YES,
THEY USUALLY DO,

13:20.732 --> 13:22.299
BUT I WAS
JUST PASSING BY,

13:22.367 --> 13:24.101
AND I SAW IT SITTING
THERE ALL BY ITSELF,

13:24.169 --> 13:26.737
AND IT
LOOKED SO SAD.

13:26.804 --> 13:30.641
OOH! WHAT'S THAT PAPER CLIP
DOING THERE? I'LL GET IT.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.309
I GOTCHA.

13:32.377 --> 13:33.761
THANK YOU.

13:33.828 --> 13:35.412
OH, ONE QUICK QUESTION.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.214
HOW'S BETTY
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?

13:37.282 --> 13:38.749
IS SHE-SHE WORKING OUT?

13:38.817 --> 13:39.967
SHE'S DOING FINE.
YEAH?

13:40.034 --> 13:42.753
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD. SHE'S
GOOD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

13:42.820 --> 13:45.322
BUT EVEN WITH ALL THE
VACATIONS? I MEAN, I JUST-

13:45.390 --> 13:48.259
MY PHILOSOPHY FOR THE PEOPLE
I WORK FOR IS "WORK FIRST,"

13:48.326 --> 13:50.361
YOU KNOW? AND I KNOW LAST
MONTH SHE WAS IN FLORIDA,

13:50.429 --> 13:53.931
AND THEN, WHAT, 2 WEEKS AGO SHE
JUST COULDN'T BOTHER TO SHOW UP?

13:53.998 --> 13:56.199
HER GALLBLADDER EXPLODED.

13:56.267 --> 13:58.769
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.438
CARRIE,
I HEARD ABOUT PRUZAN,

14:01.506 --> 14:03.741
AND IF THIS IS YOUR WAY
OF LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB,

14:03.808 --> 14:07.728
I JUST HAVE TO SAY
THIS IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

14:07.796 --> 14:10.281
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

14:10.349 --> 14:14.051
AND, FRANKLY, I WOULD HATE
FOR A CLIENT TO WALK IN

14:14.119 --> 14:17.555
AND SEE YOU...
ON DISPLAY LIKE THAT.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.358
I'LL, UH,
I'LL BUTTON UP.

14:21.426 --> 14:22.693
THANK YOU
FOR THE FED-EX.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.462
ACTUALLY,
THIS ISN'T FOR YOU.

14:34.239 --> 14:36.507
CARRIE, THERE YOU ARE.

14:36.575 --> 14:39.643
SO WHERE ARE WE AT
OMELET-WISE?

14:39.711 --> 14:42.346
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE GETTING A CARD.

14:42.414 --> 14:43.514
A CARD?
YEAH.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.749
WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
I THOUGHT ICE-CREAM CAKE,

14:45.817 --> 14:47.751
BUT THIS IS CHILLING.

14:47.819 --> 14:49.120
YOU GOTTA GET THEM
TO BUMP IT UP.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.055
MR. PRUZAN, I KNOW YOUR
EGG ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT,

14:52.124 --> 14:54.891
BUT I'VE GOT MY OWN GETTING
FIRED THANG GOING ON HERE,

14:54.959 --> 14:55.776
SO I GOTTA DEAL
WITH MY OWN THING-

14:55.844 --> 14:56.860
THERE'S MR. KAPLAN!

14:56.928 --> 14:58.228
YOU CAN TALK TO HIM
RIGHT NOW.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.463
WHAT? NO. HE'S THE HEAD OF THE FIRM.

14:59.530 --> 15:00.597
YES, AND HE'S ALSO THE GUY

15:00.665 --> 15:01.932
WHO CAN GREEN-LIGHT OMELET MAN
IN A HEARTBEAT.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.668
NO! NO! NO! NO!
GO! GO! GO! GO!

15:04.735 --> 15:07.938
MR. KAPLAN, HI.

15:08.006 --> 15:09.373
OH, HELLO, CARRIE.

15:09.441 --> 15:12.209
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

15:12.277 --> 15:14.461
MM, SURE.

15:14.529 --> 15:17.290
WELL, I WAS JUST-
I WAS WONDERING IF, UM-

15:17.325 --> 15:20.051
ACTUALLY, I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT MY JOB.

15:20.118 --> 15:21.685
I KNOW
MR. PRUZAN IS LEAVING,

15:21.752 --> 15:23.336
AND, UM, I'M SURE
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

15:23.405 --> 15:25.105
THAT I'M
A LITTLE CONCERNED,

15:25.172 --> 15:27.608
BECAUSE, UM, YOU KNOW
I'VE WORKED FOR THIS FIRM

15:27.675 --> 15:28.776
FOR A LONG TIME,
AND I'M REALLY-

15:28.843 --> 15:31.678
CARRIE, CARRIE,
YOU'LL BE FINE.

15:31.746 --> 15:32.679
REALLY?

15:32.747 --> 15:34.398
ABSOLUTELY.
DON'T WORRY.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.499
OH.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.402
THAT DEADWOOD BOSS OF YOURS,
HE SHOULD WORRY.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.238
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T BE TELLING YOU THIS,

15:41.306 --> 15:43.324
BUT DO YOU KNOW THAT HE ACTUALLY
CALLS HOME DURING THE DAY

15:43.391 --> 15:44.391
TO TALK
TO HIS ANSWERING MACHINE

15:44.459 --> 15:46.827
SO HIS CAT
WON'T GET LONELY?

15:46.895 --> 15:48.629
SO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY WE'RE LETTING HIM GO.

15:48.696 --> 15:49.996
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.168
OH, MR. KAPLAN,
ONE MORE QUICK THING.

15:55.236 --> 15:57.971
UM, DEADWOOD
WAS ACTUALLY HOPING

15:58.039 --> 16:00.874
FOR, UM, THAT OMELET MAN
THING. I KNOW IT'S SILLY,

16:00.942 --> 16:03.811
BUT IT WOULD REALLY EASE
THE BLOW FOR HIM, YOU KNOW?

16:03.878 --> 16:09.032
CARRIE, THAT MAN
COST THIS FIRM $47 MILLION.

16:09.100 --> 16:11.134
THE ONLY WAY
HE CAN HAVE OMELET MAN

16:11.202 --> 16:13.838
IS IF HE PAYS FOR IT
HIMSELF.

16:13.872 --> 16:16.807
THAT SEEMS FAIR.
OK. BYE-BYE.

16:18.676 --> 16:19.793
HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS:

16:19.861 --> 16:22.413
YOU TELL YOUR KID THE
KOOSH GOT CALLED BACK

16:22.480 --> 16:24.548
TO ITS HOME PLANET
OF KOOSHERON

16:24.616 --> 16:26.784
WHERE KOOSH LIVE,
WORK, AND WORSHIP

16:26.851 --> 16:30.320
AND THROW AROUND
TINY PEOPLE FOR FUN.

16:30.388 --> 16:31.989
THERE IT IS.

16:34.759 --> 16:37.728
OK, EVERYTHING
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

16:37.796 --> 16:40.564
I SHOULD HAVE YOUR REPORT BACK
TO YOU MONDAY AT THE LATEST.

16:40.632 --> 16:43.033
GREAT. THANKS FOR STOPPING
BY OUR LITTLE DEPOT.

16:43.101 --> 16:47.237
WHERE IS MY CAR?

16:47.305 --> 16:49.773
THE DRIVER SAID HE
JUST HAD TO BRING IT AROUND.

16:51.475 --> 16:53.844
WHAT DO
YOU HAVE THERE?

16:53.912 --> 16:55.145
A KOOSH?

16:55.213 --> 16:58.131
THIS? UH, YEAH.

16:58.199 --> 17:00.434
YO YO YO.

17:02.487 --> 17:04.387
I'M GOING IN.

17:12.663 --> 17:13.896
ZIGGATA!

17:13.964 --> 17:15.965
HEY, HEFFERNAN.

17:16.032 --> 17:19.269
THIS IS HEFFERNAN AND PALMER,
A COUPLE OF OUR DRIVERS.

17:19.337 --> 17:20.253
HEY. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.387
HOW YOU DOING?

17:21.455 --> 17:24.642
HOO-HOO!

17:30.014 --> 17:31.031
YO YO!

17:33.284 --> 17:34.501
ZIGGATATOWW!

17:34.569 --> 17:36.203
HOO-HOO.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.942
RRRR! RRRR!

17:46.030 --> 17:47.498
OK, THIS IS ME.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.900
THANKS, PATRICK.

17:50.051 --> 17:51.485
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

17:55.941 --> 17:56.907
HOO-HOO.

17:58.777 --> 18:01.712
SHAMINA-HOMINA.

18:08.152 --> 18:09.420
WHAT HAVE YOU
GOT THERE, PAUL?

18:09.487 --> 18:11.388
BACON CRUMBLES, SWISS?

18:11.456 --> 18:14.391
MY GOD, THEY REALLY
WENT ALL OUT FOR ME.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.360
WHICH CREDIT CARD DID
YOU WANT TO PUT THIS ON?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.362
NOT NOW.

18:20.264 --> 18:22.466
OH, MR. KAPLAN.
THERE YOU GO.

18:22.534 --> 18:24.167
OH, AND DON'T FORGET
YOUR NAPKIN.

18:24.235 --> 18:27.103
DON'T WANT TO GET ANYTHING ON THAT
GORGEOUS LITTLE TIE YOU GOT THERE.

18:27.171 --> 18:28.472
WHAT ARE THOSE? DUCKS?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.842
THEY'RE TINY PICTURES
OF MY SON HARRISON.

18:33.611 --> 18:36.980
OH!

18:37.048 --> 18:39.350
LOOK AT THAT.
HE'S GOT YOUR EYES.

18:42.086 --> 18:44.237
UM, MR. KAPLAN?

18:44.305 --> 18:46.006
I WAS HOPING
THAT WE COULD, UM-

18:46.073 --> 18:49.410
ONE SECOND.
I'LL TAKE, UH...

18:49.477 --> 18:51.812
MUSHROOMS
AND ARTICHOKES AND-

18:51.880 --> 18:53.714
WHAT IS THAT?
WAFER-THIN PROSCIUTTO?

18:53.782 --> 18:57.083
HIT ME.

18:57.151 --> 18:58.652
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS THAT?

18:58.720 --> 19:01.187
OH, I JUST THOUGHT WE COULD
TALK ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION.

19:01.255 --> 19:03.056
WHAT CONVERSATION?

19:03.124 --> 19:06.793
REMEMBER IN THE ELEVATOR?
OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT-

19:06.861 --> 19:09.262
THAT I WOULD
STILL HAVE A JOB HERE.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.698
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU
STILL HAVE A JOB HERE

19:11.766 --> 19:13.266
IF YOUR BOSS IS LEAVING?

19:13.334 --> 19:15.902
WHO YOU
GONNA WORK FOR?

19:15.970 --> 19:19.039
BUT YOU SAID
EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE.

19:19.107 --> 19:20.107
I MEAN, YOU SAID THAT.

19:20.174 --> 19:21.541
WELL, I GUESS I MEANT

19:21.609 --> 19:23.143
THAT EVERYTHING
WOULD BE FINE WITH YOU

19:23.210 --> 19:24.711
OUT THERE
IN THE JOB MARKET.

19:24.779 --> 19:27.547
YOU'RE
A VERY COMPETENT PERSON.

19:27.615 --> 19:30.651
EASY THERE, CHICO. I
LIKE MY EGGS A LITTLE WET.

19:30.718 --> 19:32.853
MR. KAPLAN,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND

19:32.920 --> 19:34.521
THAT I NEED
THIS JOB?

19:34.588 --> 19:37.590
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE
$25 MILLION IN THE BANK

19:37.659 --> 19:39.059
AND A HOUSE
ON THE BEACH, YOU KNOW?

19:39.127 --> 19:41.795
I HAVE ONE HOUSE, AND IT'S
VERY CLOSE TO A GAS STATION.

19:41.863 --> 19:43.396
CARRIE,
CAN WE DO THIS LATER?

19:43.464 --> 19:44.865
NO, WE CAN'T
DO THIS LATER, OK?

19:44.932 --> 19:46.133
WE'RE DOING THIS
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

19:46.200 --> 19:47.333
SO YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND

19:47.401 --> 19:49.169
WHY I TOOK THAT
KIND OF SERIOUSLY,

19:49.236 --> 19:51.371
BUT IF YOU'RE-
IF YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW

19:51.438 --> 19:53.439
THAT YOU'RE
JUST GONNA LET ME GO,

19:53.507 --> 19:56.910
THEN I GUESS I
JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.512
WHERE'S MY OMELET BAR?

19:59.580 --> 20:01.148
HMM?
I HAVE BUSTED MY ASS

20:01.215 --> 20:02.916
FOR THIS COMPANY
FOR 7 YEARS.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.419
I HAVE COME IN EARLY. I HAVE
STAYED LATE FOR NO EXTRA PAY.

20:06.487 --> 20:08.972
I BABYSAT FOR YOUR
FREAK-DUCK-LOOKING BOY HARRISON THERE

20:09.040 --> 20:09.973
AT THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.144
AND I'VE MADE THOUSANDS
OF TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

20:14.212 --> 20:15.980
FOR ALL OF YOU AND THE
HOT LITTLE PARALEGALS

20:16.047 --> 20:19.349
YOU'RE ALL "MENTORING."

20:19.417 --> 20:20.784
SO I GUESS, YEAH.

20:20.852 --> 20:23.353
WHERE'S MY OMELET BAR?!
WHERE IS IT, HUH?!

20:23.421 --> 20:27.056
CARRIE,
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

20:27.124 --> 20:29.526
I WOULD JUST HATE
FOR OUR LAST INTERACTION

20:29.594 --> 20:32.195

CALLING SECURITY ON YOU.

20:32.263 --> 20:33.196
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:33.264 --> 20:34.230
YOU DON'T GOTTA
CALL SECURITY.

ON 48th STREET AND LEX, AND I'M
GONNA SIT DOWN, AND I'M GONNA ORDER

20:41.990 --> 20:44.924
ONE OF THE JUICIEST, CHEESIEST
OMELETS THAT I CAN GET,

20:44.992 --> 20:47.093
AND I'M GONNA SIT THERE

20:47.161 --> 20:48.895
FOR THE GREAT JOB THAT
I'VE DONE FOR THIS FIRM,

20:48.963 --> 20:50.230
AND THEN I'M PROBABLY
GONNA THROW UP,

20:50.297 --> 20:52.198
BECAUSE THE FOOD THERE
IS PRETTY QUESTIONABLE.

20:57.405 --> 20:59.873

21:02.911 --> 21:06.062
FIRED. THAT STINGS.
