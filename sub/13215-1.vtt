00:30.798 --> 00:34.466
<i>¶ We'll be fighting</i>
<i>In the streets ¶</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:38.470
<i>¶ With our children</i>
<i>At our feet ¶</i>

00:38.472 --> 00:42.041
<i>¶ And the morals that</i>
<i>They worship will be gone ¶</i>

00:45.613 --> 00:49.048
<i>¶ And the men</i>
<i>Who spurred us on ¶</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:52.384
<i>¶ Sit in judgment</i>
<i>Of all wrong ¶</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:56.722
<i>¶ They decide and the shotgun</i>
<i>Sings the song ¶</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:03.695
<i>¶ I'll tip my hat</i>
<i>To the new constitution ¶</i>

01:03.697 --> 01:07.332
<i>¶ Take a bow</i>
<i>For the new revolution ¶</i>

01:07.334 --> 01:10.769
<i>¶ Smile and grin</i>
<i>At the change all around ¶</i>

01:10.771 --> 01:14.339
<i>¶ Pick up my guitar and play ¶</i>

01:14.341 --> 01:17.309
<i>¶ Just like yesterday ¶</i>

01:17.311 --> 01:20.546
<i>¶ Then I'll get on my knees</i>
<i>And pray ¶</i>

01:24.518 --> 01:28.087
<i>¶ We don't get fooled again ¶</i>

01:28.089 --> 01:32.524
Hey, Dildo,
get that mangy mutt out of here.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.362
<i>Dildo. That's what</i>
<i>my old man called me,</i>

01:37.364 --> 01:38.831
<i>Dildo Dunphy.</i>

01:43.471 --> 01:46.405
Can you believe
this fucking town?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.573
This blows.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.574
Dunph, give me another beer.

01:48.576 --> 01:51.577
None left. Just lemonade.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.145
All right.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.517
Hey, let's go
to the parking lot.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.385
What for? All guys.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.454
How about the field?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.289
Fuck the field.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.792
Where do the girls go
at night, huh?

02:06.794 --> 02:09.261
You know what?
We should go to the edge.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.263
Sully stinkfingered Bunny Cote
over there.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.432
What?
They were doing bongs and shit.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.534
And he stinkfingered her
in his car.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.836
With his finger, Sully.
How do you know?

02:17.838 --> 02:21.173
His finger stunk. Drugs,

02:21.175 --> 02:23.575
you smelled his finger?

02:24.778 --> 02:27.379
You retard.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.414
<i>That's my brother, Jackie.</i>

02:29.416 --> 02:31.750
<i>He had a freak accident</i>
<i>when he was a kid.</i>

02:31.752 --> 02:33.886
<i>You see,</i>
<i>we were playing touch football,</i>

02:33.888 --> 02:35.521
<i>and, uh,</i>
<i>well, he fell off the roof.</i>

02:35.523 --> 02:37.856
Everybody's hard on Nixon.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.225
- Right, well, why not?
- Guy's a putz.

02:40.227 --> 02:43.362
He didn't do nothing all
those other assholes didn't do.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.364
Yeah, he did. He got pinched.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.432
Please, that was
a fucking witch-hunt.

02:47.434 --> 02:49.668
Those two Jewish bastards gave
a shit about this country,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.203
they'd have kept
their traps shut.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.305
Cavwich,
Woodward ain't Jewish, okay?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.774
Those guys are reporters.
They're just doing their job.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.609
They're stool pigeons.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.478
You don't accuse the president

02:59.480 --> 03:00.879
of the highest office
in the land of stuff

03:00.881 --> 03:02.681
when all you got is
some lousy erased tapes.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.449
It isn't enough.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.852
Especially all the guy's trying
to do is cover his own ass.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.487
Thank you.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.422
What did this clown ever do
for us besides go to China?

03:10.424 --> 03:12.491
- I guarantee...
- Jackie.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.726
...that 20 years from now,
because of Nixon,

03:14.728 --> 03:17.629
that our friends will be
right beside us fighting.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.731
Jackie. What's up?

03:19.733 --> 03:22.401
Go in my room
and get me my bong.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.703
Which one? The big one.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.440
Dildo, what the hell are
you doing out there?

03:28.442 --> 03:29.908
He's getting my jacket.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.378
I didn't want to bug you guys
during your game.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.880
What bug? Who are you bugging?

03:34.882 --> 03:38.250
Now drag your pimply ass in here
and say hi to the guys.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.686
Show some class, for crissakes.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.756
Dunph, I can't go in there.
I'm too fucked up.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.362
Hey, Dildo!

03:50.364 --> 03:52.364
What are you other
dip-shits up to?

03:52.366 --> 03:54.499
Nothing.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.701
Hey, Mousy.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.969
Hmm?

03:56.971 --> 03:58.303
What's this shit?

03:58.305 --> 04:01.240
That's a beard.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.408
What the fuck does someone your
age need a beard for?

04:03.410 --> 04:06.345
You know what they say about
guys with beards, aren't you?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.947
Queers. Queers?

04:08.949 --> 04:10.816
Yeah, every one of them.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.784
What do you think
they're going for?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.786
They're afraid they look
too much like broads.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.488
<i>That's Cavwich.</i>

04:16.490 --> 04:18.923
<i>He's a used-car salesman,</i>
<i>claims he's connected.</i>

04:18.926 --> 04:21.560
What about Abraham Lincoln?

04:21.562 --> 04:24.429
Lincoln? Queer as they come.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.932
You got farts in your head.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.735
I'm telling you, it's true.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.436
It ain't me.
Look it up in the book.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.672
Here, Dunph,
here's your jacket.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.619
What in the world
is this contraption?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.755
It's a horn.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.323
A horn?

04:51.325 --> 04:54.660
Yeah, you know,
like a music horn.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.029
Yeah, it's a horn.

04:57.031 --> 05:00.399
Okay, Satchmo, why don't you
play us a few notes?

05:17.418 --> 05:20.319
All right, ass-bag.
Enough of that nonsense.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.887
Why don't you and those other
ass-bags get out of here

05:21.889 --> 05:24.589
and quit bugging us?

05:24.591 --> 05:26.458
See you later.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.864
<i>¶ I'd like to know where</i>
<i>You got the notion ¶</i>

05:32.866 --> 05:34.032
<i>¶ To rock the boat ¶</i>

05:34.034 --> 05:35.567
<i>¶ Don't rock the boat, baby ¶</i>

05:35.569 --> 05:36.702
<i>¶ Rock the boat ¶</i>

05:36.704 --> 05:37.736
<i>¶ Don't tip the boat over ¶</i>

05:37.738 --> 05:38.837
<i>¶ Rock the boat ¶</i>

05:38.839 --> 05:40.005
<i>¶ Don't rock the boat, baby ¶</i>

05:40.007 --> 05:42.641
<i>¶ Rock the boat ¶</i>

05:46.814 --> 05:51.350
<i>¶ Ever since our voyage</i>
<i>Of love began ¶</i>

05:51.352 --> 05:53.652
¶<i> Your touch has thrilled me</i>
<i>Like the rush of the wind ¶</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:55.787
They look like a bunch of fags.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.490
I know.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.759
I'd be a fag too if
I could get that kind of pussy.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.794
You just said you'd be a fag.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.730
Yeah. Then I could get
that kind of pussy.

06:04.732 --> 06:08.433
No amount of babes in the world
is worth being a homo for.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.716
Hey, there's Bunny Cote.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.509
Let's go talk to her.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.911
No, I'm not talking to her.
You go talk to her.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.914
Hey, Dunph.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.916
Hi, Bunny.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.519
Want to dance?

06:27.521 --> 06:30.655
Nah. I'm not very good
at disco dancing.

06:30.657 --> 06:34.526
So just regular dance. Come on.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.761
<i>¶ Don't rock the boat, baby ¶</i>

06:35.763 --> 06:42.401
<i>¶ Rock the boat ¶</i>

06:42.403 --> 06:46.605

06:55.516 --> 06:57.582
<i>¶ Don't let me drift away</i>
<i>My dear ¶</i>

06:57.584 --> 07:02.120
Cut it out, huh?
You look like an asshole.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.089
Sorry.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.092
<i>¶ Our love is like</i>
<i>A ship on the ocean ¶</i>

07:07.094 --> 07:09.795
Hey.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.664
<i>¶ Mississippi queen ¶</i>

07:12.666 --> 07:16.168
<i>¶ If you know what I mean ¶</i>

07:16.170 --> 07:19.771
<i>¶ Mississippi queen ¶</i>

07:19.773 --> 07:22.073
So how's Sully?

07:22.075 --> 07:25.110
Write the fucking thing, please?
Write the fucking thing.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.213
All gone.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.685
Whoa, That fucking
packs a punch, man.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
Aw, fuck.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.998
Aw, shit.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.801
Oh, fuck me.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.505
Oh, my God.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.824
A horn, huh?

08:15.496 --> 08:17.496
A music horn.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.836
Fuck.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.638
Damn moron.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.913
A prep school?
What's a prep school?

08:34.914 --> 08:36.815
It's to prepare you

08:36.817 --> 08:39.951
for not getting
your neck broke by me.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.953
You're just goddamn lucky
Cavwich had pull with the judge.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.056
Grass, no license.

08:45.058 --> 08:48.260
You hit a parked cop car.

08:48.262 --> 08:51.596
Don't get me started
again, Dildo.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.733
But, Pop,
I'm gonna be a senior.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.135
You can't send me away
my senior year.

08:57.137 --> 09:00.539
Aw, let me go
and get my violin.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.974
One more thing.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.212
Cut that fucking mop
on top of your head

09:07.214 --> 09:10.148
or I will cut it for you.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.290
Just can't believe this shit.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.592
Look at my fucking head.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.595
So, where is this place anyway?

09:23.597 --> 09:26.831
Two and a half hours from here
in Cornwall, Connecticut.

09:26.833 --> 09:29.968
Least you'll be getting out
of this fucking shithole.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.137
You really think the Bucket's
a shithole, mousy?

09:32.139 --> 09:34.906
Should put a toilet seat
on top of this place.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.008
If it sucks so bad, why don't
you move to Providence?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.743
Like that would
change anything.

09:38.745 --> 09:42.647
California. When I graduate
that's where I'm heading.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.317
California. They got babes
like a bastard out there.

09:45.319 --> 09:48.053
It's because they're rich there.

09:48.055 --> 09:50.188
Rich guys marry babes.
It's called breeding.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.959
They got babes, they got weed.
They got cars that don't rust.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.862
Weed and cars that don't rust?
Fucking A, I'm all over that.

09:57.864 --> 10:02.133
You fucking losers go.
I'm staying right here.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.978
So, uh...

10:12.980 --> 10:15.280
You think Bunny goes out
on dates?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.882
Bunny Cote? Yeah.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.250
Drugs, she fucks everybody
in town.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.987
I know. I'm just saying.
I'm just saying, you know.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.789
I'll go to the movies
by myself.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.324
Hey, Drugs,

10:26.326 --> 10:29.260
if you had to say
who was your best friend,

10:29.262 --> 10:30.629
you would say me, right?

10:30.631 --> 10:32.664
No question.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.166
Yeah, if you blow me. Why?

10:35.168 --> 10:37.168
Nah, man. Come on.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.205
I need you to do something
for me.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.773
What?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.908
Well, you got to say yes first.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.191
All right, yes. Now what?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.080
All right.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.016
I know it's a pain in the ass,

10:51.018 --> 10:53.785
but you got to help Jackie with
the paper route while I'm gone.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.421
Just while I'm gone, Drugs.

10:58.225 --> 10:59.891
Is it the morning paper?

10:59.893 --> 11:01.693
<i>That was the difference</i>
<i>between Drugs</i>

11:01.695 --> 11:03.862
<i>and the rest of the guys.</i>
<i>He was more reliable.</i>

11:03.864 --> 11:05.830
<i>If he gave you his word,</i>

11:05.832 --> 11:07.899
<i>there was a fifty-fifty chance</i>
<i>he'd come through.</i>

11:07.901 --> 11:09.934
Here's 30 frog pelts for you.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.771
Oh, and please don't thank me.
It's just a loan.

11:12.773 --> 11:16.207
Don't give me that look, Dildo.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.877
You're one lucky bastard,
and you don't know it.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.179
What I wouldn't give
for an opportunity like this

11:21.181 --> 11:23.348
when I was a kid, and your first
homework assignment

11:23.350 --> 11:24.983
is to write a letter to Cavwich

11:24.985 --> 11:26.786
and thank him for getting you
into this place.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.119
And don't forget
what the judge said.

11:28.121 --> 11:32.090
You don't graduate,
it's one year in Socko.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.326
Heh. Prep school don't sound
so bad now, huh, Dildo?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.832
Take it easy, Dunph.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.935
Yeah, you too, Jackie.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.737
- All right. Come on.
- Let's go.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.372
You're gonna miss the bus.

11:50.444 --> 11:53.445
Hey, Dunph. The Jets game.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.080
Don't forget.

11:55.082 --> 11:56.347
Yeah, all right.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.816
- All right.
- Come on. Come on.

12:03.090 --> 12:06.391
<i>¶ And if it's bad ¶</i>

12:06.393 --> 12:09.427
<i>¶ Don't let it get you down ¶</i>

12:09.429 --> 12:12.931
<i>¶ You can take it ¶</i>

12:12.933 --> 12:14.766
<i>My old man always wondered</i>

12:14.768 --> 12:17.001
<i>if Cavwich really had</i>
<i>the connections he said he did.</i>

12:17.003 --> 12:18.336
<i>I guess there was no doubt</i>

12:18.338 --> 12:20.004
<i>after what happened</i>
<i>with the judge</i>

12:20.006 --> 12:22.440
<i>and me getting into this place.</i>

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
<i>Thanks a lot, Cavwich.</i>

12:24.244 --> 12:27.045
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:27.047 --> 12:29.481
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:29.483 --> 12:32.117
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:32.119 --> 12:35.086
<i>¶ Hold your head high ¶</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:37.789
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:37.791 --> 12:40.391
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:40.393 --> 12:43.228
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

12:43.230 --> 12:46.765
<i>¶ Hold your head high ¶</i>

13:15.862 --> 13:16.828
Mr. Dunphy.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.967
Right this way.

13:22.969 --> 13:26.070
I'm Mr. Funderburk,
your dorm master.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.873
These are the rules.

13:28.875 --> 13:31.876
Listen carefully.

13:31.878 --> 13:35.180
No smoking, no drinking,
no drugs, no sex,

13:35.182 --> 13:38.283
no cheating, no lying,
no gambling, no matches.

13:38.285 --> 13:40.418
No shit?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.987
No swearing.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.256
No showering after dinner.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.959
Be in your room by 10 p.m.,
lights out at 10:30,

13:47.961 --> 13:50.161
and no locks allowed
on the door.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.063
Don't go into town
without written permission.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.965
There are many other rules.

13:53.967 --> 13:57.101
Here's your handbook. Study it.

13:57.103 --> 13:58.904
If you get caught breaking
any of those rules,

13:58.905 --> 14:01.840
you'll be stung with work hours
after class.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.249
Hey.

14:11.251 --> 14:14.152
Fonzie. Where you going?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.223
The assembly.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.505
Like that?

14:27.934 --> 14:30.902
Thanks, man.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.537
Settle down, people.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.306
Settle down. Settle down.
Settle down.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.342
Today,

14:37.344 --> 14:43.214
we commence Cornwall Academy's
82nd year of existence.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.316
Boring.

14:45.318 --> 14:49.287
In the past 10 years,
other institutions of our ilk

14:49.289 --> 14:54.158
have chosen to liberalize
their curriculum.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.195
While these other institutions

14:57.197 --> 15:00.999
have grown to expect less
from their students,

15:01.001 --> 15:04.335
we here at Cornwall
expect more.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.272
Now, you new students
might not fully understand

15:07.274 --> 15:10.041
exactly what
this commitment means.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.410
So I will leave you now

15:12.412 --> 15:16.948
while Mr. Funderburk chooses
a returning student

15:16.950 --> 15:21.619
to rise and recite
our school fight song.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.456
Welcome.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.025
Funderjerk.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.535
Mr. Irving Waltham.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.337
Jizz!

15:39.339 --> 15:43.508
Would you please rise and sing
for us the school fight song?

15:43.510 --> 15:45.576
Go, Jizz!

15:52.052 --> 15:53.613
He looks like he's gonna
piss his pants.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.189
¶ As... ¶

15:58.191 --> 16:01.159
¶ We stand tall ¶

16:01.161 --> 16:04.963
¶ At old Cornwall ¶

16:04.965 --> 16:09.200
¶ Our spirits tried and true ¶

16:09.202 --> 16:13.404
¶ Our minds are strong ¶

16:13.406 --> 16:16.975
"Our spirits tried and true."

16:16.977 --> 16:20.445
¶ Our spirits tried and true ¶

16:23.350 --> 16:26.584
It seems Mr. Waltham
has forgotten the words.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.386
No, I...

16:28.388 --> 16:29.721
¶ Our spirits... ¶

16:29.723 --> 16:32.757
Gentlemen, who here thinks

16:32.759 --> 16:34.692
that we should extend
to Mr. Waltham

16:34.694 --> 16:37.261
the proper motivation

16:37.263 --> 16:41.032
so that he will never again
forget the school fight song?

16:41.034 --> 16:43.601
No, I know the song! Stop!

16:43.603 --> 16:45.444
Put me down. I know the song!

16:48.308 --> 16:50.375
¶ Our minds are strong ¶

16:50.377 --> 16:52.076
¶ Our work days long ¶

16:52.078 --> 16:55.279
¶ Our toils we ere see through ¶

16:55.281 --> 16:58.683
Would you stop that, please?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.618
Would you stop that, please?

17:00.620 --> 17:03.287
I'm trying to study.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.356
Yeah, me too.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.526
And this is the first thing
I want to learn.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.262
I'd take another peek at it
if I was you.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.196
I already told you.
I know that song.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.599
I got nervous. I do that.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.702
I get nervous.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.369
What are you studying
down there anyway?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.039
Class stuff.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.608
Classes don't start
until tomorrow, kid.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.076
You mean
you haven't started studying?

17:25.078 --> 17:27.278
Oh, man.
You're never gonna catch up.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.350
10:30. Lights out.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.386
Oh, okay. Give me five more
minutes with this thing.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.388
No, I already got
three hours tomorrow

17:37.390 --> 17:39.057
for not knowing
that stupid song.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.292
Okay, buddy, calm down.

17:49.803 --> 17:52.403
<i>I've never been apart</i>
<i>from my brother Jackie</i>

17:52.405 --> 17:54.539
<i>in my whole life, and already</i>
<i>I was starting to miss him.</i>

17:54.541 --> 17:56.741
<i>I felt kind of bad</i>

17:56.743 --> 17:59.744
<i>about the way I left things</i>
<i>at the bus station.</i>

17:59.746 --> 18:02.146
<i>I knew I wouldn't sleep</i>
<i>until I talked to him.</i>

18:02.148 --> 18:03.714
Ow.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.249
Sorry.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.285
What are you doing?

18:07.287 --> 18:08.786
I got to make a phone call.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.122
You can't make a phone call
after 10:00.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.624
Lights are out.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.160
That's it, man.

18:16.162 --> 18:20.331
Now you're gonna get stung.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.233
<i>Will you accept</i>
<i>a collect call from Tim?</i>

18:22.235 --> 18:24.202
<i>Tim Dunphy?</i> Yes.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.170
<i>For crissakes,</i>
<i>you just left today.</i>

18:26.172 --> 18:27.572
I gotta talk to Jackie.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.707
<i>Do you accept the call?</i>

18:29.709 --> 18:33.211
<i>- Come on. It's 11:00. You know</i>
<i>- I got to work tomorrow.</i>

18:33.213 --> 18:34.645
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to disconnect you now.</i>

18:34.647 --> 18:36.547
Just tell Jackie
that I'll take him...

18:39.786 --> 18:41.352
...to the game.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.728
I told you you'd get stung.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.864
I hope your phone call
was worth it.

18:52.866 --> 18:54.765
Hey, Jizz. Catch.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.534
Ow! Unh.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.270
Hey! Hey!

18:59.272 --> 19:00.671
That's gonna leave a mark.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.673
My glasses.

19:04.277 --> 19:07.678
I can't... I can't find my...

19:16.756 --> 19:19.490
We got about 10 minutes till
Clusterfuck makes his rounds.

19:21.694 --> 19:26.197
<i>¶ Been 40 days</i>
<i>Since I don't know when ¶</i>

19:26.199 --> 19:29.400
<i>¶ I just saw her</i>
<i>With my best friend ¶</i>

19:29.402 --> 19:31.569
<i>¶ Do you know what I mean? ¶</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:37.475
Dunph, Billy Fu.
He's Middle Eastern.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.746
He's a good shit.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.750
Got the best reefer on campus.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.387
<i>¶ Do you know what I mean? ¶</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:53.257
<i>¶ Lord, do you know</i>
<i>What I mean? ¶</i>

20:06.506 --> 20:08.739
It's a barrel of laughs,
eh, Dunph?

20:08.741 --> 20:10.775
<i>¶ Do you know</i>
<i>Know what I mean? ¶</i>

20:12.478 --> 20:14.612
All righty, class.

20:17.350 --> 20:20.551
Who can tell me what X equals?

20:20.553 --> 20:24.822
Okay. Mr... Mr. Dunphy.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.328
Mr. Dunphy?

20:30.330 --> 20:33.564
Um...

20:33.566 --> 20:35.666
I think I'm in the wrong class.

20:35.668 --> 20:36.212
In 1933,

20:40.607 --> 20:44.609
who launched the New Deal?

20:46.779 --> 20:49.714
Mr. Dunphy.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.916
Mr. Dunphy?

20:51.918 --> 20:55.853
Who launched the New Deal?

20:55.855 --> 20:58.256
Um...

21:02.262 --> 21:04.295
What we're gonna do here today
is I'm gonna go around the room,

21:04.297 --> 21:05.930
and I'd like each of you
to name your favorite author.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.865
Hemingway. Salinger.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.700
Faulkner.

21:09.702 --> 21:10.968
Uh, Hamlet.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.637
Jack London.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.905
So, what are you doing
on Sunday afternoon?

21:14.907 --> 21:17.808
Summarizing the works
of William Shakespeare.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.845
Ohh. You should have gone
with Salinger,

21:20.847 --> 21:22.413
because he only wrote
a couple of books.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.848
Whoa, wait a second.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.683
<i>¶ Goddess on a mountaintop ¶</i>

21:25.685 --> 21:29.553
<i>¶ Burning like a silver flame ¶</i>

21:29.555 --> 21:32.690
<i>¶ The summit</i>
<i>Of beauty and love ¶</i>

21:32.692 --> 21:34.358
<i>¶ And Venus was her name ¶</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:35.893
Who... Who's...

21:35.895 --> 21:37.862
What are you, an owl?

21:37.864 --> 21:39.664
Forget it.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.400
Her name's Jane Weston,

21:42.402 --> 21:43.934
hands down the coolest chick
in school.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.504
Forget it.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.372
<i>¶ I'm your fire ¶</i>

21:48.374 --> 21:49.307
<i>¶ At your desire ¶</i>

21:49.309 --> 21:50.908
Oh.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.079
Little help, please?

21:55.081 --> 21:56.580
Yeah.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.994
Thanks.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.596
Thanks.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.732
Mr. Dunphy,

22:14.734 --> 22:18.469
do you have
a friend called "Drugs"?

22:18.471 --> 22:21.539
Drugs Delaney?

22:21.541 --> 22:24.442
How many individuals
named "Drugs"

22:24.444 --> 22:26.577
could you possibly
associate with?

22:26.579 --> 22:29.914
Just one.

22:29.916 --> 22:33.984
Yesterday, we received a,
uh, a letter addressed simply

22:33.986 --> 22:38.055
to Cornwall Academy,
Cornwall, Connecticut.

22:38.057 --> 22:42.426
So, naturally, we, uh...
We opened it and read it.

22:42.428 --> 22:44.395
And...

22:44.397 --> 22:46.597
You might want to sit down.

22:47.834 --> 22:51.802
It begins, "Greetings, Dunph.

22:51.804 --> 22:53.804
"What's happening?

22:53.806 --> 22:57.742
"I got your letter today.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.112
"Cornhole Academy

23:01.114 --> 23:05.416

<i>sucks the big one.</i>

23:05.418 --> 23:07.918
<i>"I can't believe they make</i>
<i>everyone</i>

23:07.920 --> 23:11.689
<i>"work a lot and not smoke.</i>

23:11.691 --> 23:14.859
<i>"You should tell that</i>
<i>piece of shit Funderturd</i>

23:14.861 --> 23:17.027
"to shove it.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.730
"You didn't want to go there
in the first place.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.032
"Eat shit, man.

23:22.034 --> 23:25.870
"Today, you should have
seen me and Mousy today

23:25.872 --> 23:28.472
at school today."

23:28.474 --> 23:31.509
We got cocked on a pint
of blackberry brandy,

23:31.511 --> 23:34.745
ate some THC on the bus.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.680
"We were fucked.

23:36.682 --> 23:39.450
This teacher, Mr. Rivera,
goes..."

23:39.452 --> 23:42.553
"What's wrong with you,
Delaney?"

23:42.555 --> 23:46.757
I go,
"I'm totally fucked, man!"

23:46.759 --> 23:50.961
"Everybody laughed
like a bastard."

23:50.963 --> 23:54.999
Oh, man. You should see
this song I'm listening to.

23:55.001 --> 23:59.136
"It's called 'Don't Bogart That
Joint, My Friend.'

23:59.138 --> 24:01.439
"I think it's by
a group called...

24:07.013 --> 24:09.713
"This is a couple
of hours later.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.086
Must have nodded out, man."

24:16.088 --> 24:19.056
I got to go 'cause I probably
definitely gonna nod out again.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.157
You want me to send you some...

24:20.159 --> 24:22.159
"...squeef?

24:22.161 --> 24:24.762
"Or you got enough?

24:24.764 --> 24:27.064
"Good luck not getting caught.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.733
Cocked in Rhode Island."

24:29.735 --> 24:32.203
Drugs.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.711
Oh, yes, there's a postscript
you might be interested in.

24:40.713 --> 24:46.016
"Mousy says he stinkfingered
Bunny Cote."

24:47.787 --> 24:50.087
As you might imagine,
Mr. Dunphy,

24:50.089 --> 24:53.090
this is... This is...
This is fairly incriminating.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.926
And, uh, technically,

24:55.928 --> 24:58.729
you have not breached any
of Cornwall Academy's rules.

24:58.731 --> 25:01.866
But you can bet
your bottom dollar, mister,

25:01.868 --> 25:05.069
we're gonna be keeping
an eye on you.

25:17.583 --> 25:21.886
<i>¶ Well, the rain exploded</i>
<i>With a mighty crash ¶</i>

25:21.888 --> 25:25.122

25:40.907 --> 25:42.806
Psst! Jackie!

25:42.808 --> 25:45.609
Don't worry,
the old man's in church.

25:48.681 --> 25:52.149
Where you been? The game's gonna
start pretty soon.

25:52.151 --> 25:55.686
Jackie, I've been thumbing
for two and a half hours.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.154
I'd get booted out
of that place

25:57.156 --> 25:58.656
if they knew I was doing this.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.124
You're giving me shit?

26:00.126 --> 26:02.826
Sorry.

26:02.828 --> 26:05.095
So how you doin'?

26:05.097 --> 26:08.265
Good.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.834
How's the old man treating
old Clapsy here?

26:10.836 --> 26:13.270
Still won't let her
in the house.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.206
How's he treating you?

26:16.208 --> 26:18.909
He's good. A little quiet.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.811
Hmm.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.947
You know what else?
I think he misses you.

26:22.949 --> 26:26.016
Heh. Really?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.085
Yeah, he talks about you
like you're dead or something.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.087
Hmm.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.506
Come on. Let's get out of here.

26:39.098 --> 26:42.900
So does it suck,
this school you're going to?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.935
No, it's all right.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.303
Really?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.608
Actually, it sucks. The big one.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.710
And this guy Funderburk hates me
like a bastard.

26:52.712 --> 26:53.844
I'm like the dumbest kid there

26:53.846 --> 26:56.814
and I gotta take
these retard classes.

26:56.816 --> 26:59.149
Come on.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.085
How come they're not stopping?

27:01.087 --> 27:02.853
Probably because
of the wheelchair, huh?

27:02.855 --> 27:05.322
Probably? No, Jackie,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.324
it's definitely
because of the wheelchair.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.293
Now quit your bitching
and let's move.

27:12.798 --> 27:15.065
<i>I never let Jackie</i>
<i>feel bad for himself</i>

27:15.067 --> 27:17.167
<i>because I wanted him to fit in.</i>

27:17.169 --> 27:20.137
<i>Nobody wants to be around</i>
<i>somebody they feel sorry for,</i>

27:20.139 --> 27:22.840
<i>so I treated him</i>
<i>like any other kid brother.</i>

27:27.880 --> 27:29.847
All right. Quit your clowning.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.148
Come on.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.988
How you doing? What's up?

27:37.990 --> 27:40.057
Listen.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.326
I got my crippled
kid brother over there,

27:42.328 --> 27:43.327
and he's a big Namath fan.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.063
And I was just wondering

27:46.065 --> 27:47.831
if maybe you could get us
onto the field.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.036
Tell you what. I can't
get you out on the field,

27:52.038 --> 27:54.838
but I got standing room only
up on the second level.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.306
Bring him right through here.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.876
Thank you so much.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.711
You ready? Yeah.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.833
All right, ham it up, okay?

28:05.151 --> 28:07.751
Thank you.

28:09.722 --> 28:13.323
<i>¶ Well, I'm a-standin' on</i>
<i>A corner in Winslow, Arizona ¶</i>

28:13.325 --> 28:16.927

28:16.929 --> 28:20.264

28:27.907 --> 28:30.407
Jack, will you be nice?

28:30.409 --> 28:34.712
<i>¶ I gotta know</i>
<i>If your sweet love ¶</i>

28:34.714 --> 28:35.979
I liked the school.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.781
I just don't know
if it's right for me.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.750
The whole way it was presented,
you know?

28:39.752 --> 28:42.920
Well, my vote says you can't
go wrong with Dartmouth.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.289
Who says I can even
get in to Dartmouth?

28:45.291 --> 28:48.258
You get your boards up a little,
you'll get in.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.461
What about you?

28:50.463 --> 28:52.229
Tim.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.997
Where are you going next year?

28:53.999 --> 28:56.467
I'm thinking, like, college.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.271
Any particular college?

29:02.842 --> 29:04.408
Yeah, probably.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.487
I'll be right back.

29:16.489 --> 29:19.356
Fill it up.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.792

you wanted one.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.169
Oh, thanks.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.437
Yeah.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.908
Mmm. What is this?

29:40.246 --> 29:44.148
<i>¶ Don't let the sound</i>

30:01.200 --> 30:03.100
Here we are.

30:08.808 --> 30:10.974
Thanks for the Coke.

30:10.976 --> 30:13.210
Good luck.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.578
- Appreciate the ride.
- No trouble at all.

30:14.580 --> 30:17.347
Nice to meet you, Jane.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.049
You too.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.418
<i>¶ Oh, we got it easy ¶</i>

30:24.056 --> 30:27.991
Billy Fu?
What are you doing up here?

30:27.993 --> 30:30.460
Isn't this Home Ec
with Perkins?

30:30.462 --> 30:32.029
Yeah.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.964
I'm in this class.

30:33.966 --> 30:35.933
I heard we were making
chocolate-chip cookies today.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.068
But, uh,

30:38.070 --> 30:40.871
I'm going to make brownies.

30:42.274 --> 30:44.308
Well, where you been, huh?

30:44.310 --> 30:45.943
Term's half over.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.612
I've been taking it easy,
you know?

30:48.614 --> 30:52.950
You see, my father,
he donate $5 million to school,

30:52.952 --> 30:55.586
and, of course, they don't see
one Yankee dime

30:55.588 --> 30:58.288
until I graduate.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.526
My father's a very sharp
cookie, eh, Dunph?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.027
Very sharp.

31:07.433 --> 31:11.268
My mother thought
you were so funny.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.603
She did?

31:12.605 --> 31:15.572
He said he wants to go
to college in Arizona

31:15.574 --> 31:17.274
because it's on the water.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.911
My father thought
he was dead serious.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.946
Oh, you got them pretty good.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.882
Oh, yeah, they were cracking up

31:24.884 --> 31:26.950
all the way
to the girls' school.

31:26.952 --> 31:30.087
Anyway, I got to get going.
See you around, Wheeler.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.089
Bye, Jim.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.225
Bye, Jane.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.930
I don't get it.

31:39.932 --> 31:44.034
You tell me how Arizona
is not on the water.

31:44.036 --> 31:47.137
Dunph, that gray border
down there,

31:47.139 --> 31:49.659
that's not water.
That's Mexico.

31:50.910 --> 31:53.477
Still?

31:53.479 --> 31:56.179
Well, what the fuck was
the Alamo for?

31:56.181 --> 31:58.415
Look, Dunph,

31:58.417 --> 32:00.651
I went through
the same kind of thing

32:00.653 --> 32:02.586
a couple of summers ago.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.554
There was this girl
at camp I liked.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.256
At first,
she was really nice to me,

32:06.258 --> 32:08.499
then suddenly, she wouldn't even
give me the time of day.

32:12.498 --> 32:13.964
This is her.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.701
Wow.

32:17.703 --> 32:21.672
S-S-She's...
She's something, Irv.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.544
Unfortunately, she knows it.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.660
Hey. Hey.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.302
Do you always do that?

32:52.304 --> 32:53.603
What?

32:53.605 --> 32:56.540
Uh, wash your pillow.

32:59.345 --> 33:01.411
Yeah, sometimes.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.380
When I'm in the mood.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.654
Toms Brook, Virginia. Wow.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.624
That sounds like
a pretty cool place to be from.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.560
Yeah, it is.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.631
It must be beautiful. Oh, yeah.

33:26.372 --> 33:29.773
So, what do people do around
here for fun? On the weekend?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.075
There's not much to do.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.744
You can go up in the woods
and get high.

33:33.746 --> 33:36.013
That's about it.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.021
So tell me about Pawtucket,
Jim.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.689
What do you want to know,
Betty?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.224
Betty?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.192
Tim.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.728
Oh! Heh. I'm sorry.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.266
Heh. Wow.

33:56.268 --> 33:59.536
This is good weed.
Yeah, it's homegrown.

33:59.538 --> 34:02.639
A friend of mine, in Pawtucket,

34:02.641 --> 34:07.577
every day he soaks
the weed in bug spray

34:07.579 --> 34:10.813
so when you smoking it,
you're also getting insecticide,

34:10.815 --> 34:13.056
which is a pretty good buzz
on its own.

34:14.686 --> 34:18.321
Have you smoked
insecticide on its own?

34:18.322 --> 34:20.791
Yeah, right? What am I, stupid?

34:20.793 --> 34:23.353
I'm gonna smoke
a deadly poison?

34:33.705 --> 34:37.206
<i>¶ No matter what you are ¶</i>

34:37.208 --> 34:38.775
Dunph!

34:38.777 --> 34:42.145
One, two...

34:42.147 --> 34:44.147
<i>¶ Doesn't matter what you do ¶</i>

34:44.149 --> 34:46.083
Three!

34:46.085 --> 34:48.418
That was very straight.
Good job.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.757
<i>¶ No matter what you do ¶</i>

34:54.860 --> 34:58.862
<i>¶ I will always be around ¶</i>

34:58.864 --> 35:02.265
<i>¶ Won't you tell me</i>
<i>What you found now ¶</i>

35:03.769 --> 35:06.770
"At your pardon,
I will myself..."

35:10.275 --> 35:12.309
Hey.

35:12.311 --> 35:13.610
Dunph.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.480
<i>¶ Be a part of it all ¶</i>

35:16.482 --> 35:18.849
Aah!

35:18.851 --> 35:20.550
<i>¶ Nothing to see ¶</i>

35:20.552 --> 35:23.653
<i>¶ Nothing would be ¶</i>

35:23.655 --> 35:26.356
<i>¶ No matter where you go ¶</i>

35:35.234 --> 35:36.900
What's this?

35:36.902 --> 35:38.835
Read it.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.144
Brown University?

35:47.146 --> 35:48.778
They got one of these
in Providence, you know.

35:48.780 --> 35:51.648
There's only one, Dunph.
Just read it.

35:54.887 --> 35:58.688
"After reviewing
your application for admission,

35:58.690 --> 36:01.725
I am pleased
to inform you that you..."

36:04.829 --> 36:06.729
"...have been accepted
to the graduating class

36:06.732 --> 36:08.832
of 1979 at Brown University."

36:08.834 --> 36:10.800
Yes.

36:10.802 --> 36:13.904
"Sincerely,
Jonathan S. Rogers Jr."

36:13.906 --> 36:16.640
So am I gonna
like Providence, Dunph?

36:21.747 --> 36:24.181
Yeah, we're gonna love it.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.315
"We're gonna love it"? Yeah.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.597
Okay.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.320
This is... This is great.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.622
Congratulations.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.457
Thank you.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.230
Mr. Dunphy.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.499
A word.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.704
Congratulations, Mr. Dunphy.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.407
You've broken another record
here at Cornwall.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.243
<i>You've got more hours</i>
<i>to work off</i>

36:53.245 --> 36:55.912
<i>than you've got time left</i>
<i>in the semester.</i>

36:55.914 --> 36:58.481
I can't be late to practice.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.283
Yo, wait up.

37:00.285 --> 37:04.521
Okay, ladies, on our feet.
Chop, chop.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.591
Jenkins and Martin,
four more hours each.

37:07.593 --> 37:08.959
How about that?

37:08.961 --> 37:10.927
What, is something funny,
gentlemen?

37:10.929 --> 37:13.363
Let's make it five,
all right? Five hours each.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.699
I do love the fall.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.901
It gives us so much work to do,
doesn't it?

37:17.903 --> 37:20.637
Five hours. Jenkins.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.449
<i>¶ She cried</i>
<i>To the southern wind ¶</i>

37:32.451 --> 37:35.318
<i>¶ About a love</i>
<i>That was sure to end ¶</i>

37:35.320 --> 37:37.988
Thanks very much, gentlemen.

37:37.990 --> 37:40.590
Always nice
doing business with you.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.760
¶<i> Headin' for a showdown ¶</i>

37:45.631 --> 37:47.931
Fire!
Fire in Funderburk's room!

37:47.933 --> 37:49.799
Someone call
the fire department!

37:49.801 --> 37:52.435
<i>¶ Looks like we're ridin'</i>
<i>On the same train ¶</i>

37:54.673 --> 37:56.940
<i>¶ Looks as though</i>
<i>There'll be more pain ¶</i>

37:56.942 --> 37:59.342
Ow! Ow! God!

37:59.344 --> 38:01.745
<i>¶ There's gonna be a showdown ¶</i>

38:03.782 --> 38:05.915
Fire! Fire!

38:05.917 --> 38:10.287
Look at my hand.
Explain how I burnt my hand.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.455
It was hot, Bill.
I'm telling you it was hot.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.458
Well, I...
What was I supposed to do?

38:19.431 --> 38:22.065
<i>Roger. That's a false alarm</i>
<i>at Cornwall...</i>

38:22.067 --> 38:25.435
This was not a false alarm.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.505
¶<i> She came to me like a friend ¶</i>

38:28.507 --> 38:33.310

38:36.315 --> 38:38.948
¶<i> There's gonna be a showdown ¶</i>

39:03.075 --> 39:04.774
Good night.

39:09.614 --> 39:12.515
You should call her, Irv.

39:12.517 --> 39:15.785
What do you mean?

39:15.787 --> 39:18.788
I mean you should go see
her over the holidays.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.358
Maybe she's changed.
Maybe she's nice again.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.893
She hasn't changed.

39:27.933 --> 39:30.533
There was this kid whose cousin
went to Cornwall.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.836
He told her.

39:32.838 --> 39:36.673
You know?
That they call me Jizz.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.509
So? Big whoop.

39:39.511 --> 39:42.512
A friend of mine from Pawtucket,
they call him Dingleberry.

39:42.514 --> 39:45.048
This guy gets more beaver
than the Hoover Dam.

39:48.620 --> 39:52.422
You know, when I first
came here, I did all right.

39:52.424 --> 39:55.992
I almost ran for class treasurer
my freshman year.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.963
Then they asked me
to join a secret club.

39:59.965 --> 40:03.566
Only five freshmen they asked,
and I was one of them.

40:05.537 --> 40:08.705
This year, you five are honored
to be the chosen ones.

40:08.707 --> 40:12.041
This brotherhood was formed
to protect one another,

40:12.043 --> 40:15.945
to aid each other
both academically and socially,

40:15.947 --> 40:21.718
to shield each other from
embarrassment and humiliation.

40:21.720 --> 40:25.655
Are you willing to come with us
into the sacred fold?

40:25.657 --> 40:27.957
Yes.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.894
Therefore,
to bind ourselves together,

40:30.896 --> 40:33.930
we must bear witness
to one another's humiliation.

40:33.932 --> 40:36.065
When I blow out this candle,

40:36.067 --> 40:38.568
we'll all drop trou

40:38.570 --> 40:40.537
and commence to jack off
till each of us hath come.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.540
This should serve as the glue
that binds us together

40:43.542 --> 40:45.942
as right-hand men
from this day forward,

40:45.944 --> 40:51.748
November 13th
in the year of our Lord 1971.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.184
We shall now begin.

41:16.208 --> 41:18.775
<i>Jizz! Jizz! Jizz! Jizz!</i>

41:25.016 --> 41:27.984
- You got tricked.
- Who gives a fuck?

41:27.986 --> 41:30.820
You flogged the dolphin, that
ain't a federal offense.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.156
Around here it is. Bullshit!

41:34.893 --> 41:38.795
You know that 99 percent
of all teenage guys beat off?

41:38.797 --> 41:40.697
Really?

41:40.699 --> 41:42.832
Yeah, 99 percent.
And something like

41:42.834 --> 41:45.735
4 percent of most girls too.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.737
Everyone on this hall beats off.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.240
Like you mean, even you, Dunph?

41:50.242 --> 41:53.276
Well, no, I don't.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.278
Not personally, I don't, but...

41:58.083 --> 42:01.584
I mean, if you read the
research, it's very common.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.661
<i>We didn't have</i>
<i>a White Christmas that year,</i>

42:11.663 --> 42:13.530
<i>but it was good</i>
<i>to be home anyway.</i>

42:13.532 --> 42:15.665
<i>Even my old man and his friends</i>
<i>seemed to be in better spirits</i>

42:15.667 --> 42:17.567
<i>around the holidays.</i>

42:17.569 --> 42:19.168
Unless you're gonna pay
for him,

42:19.170 --> 42:20.837
shut the fuck up
and let him play his own cards.

42:20.839 --> 42:23.106
Just wake up, will you, please?

42:23.108 --> 42:25.108
It's like playing with
fucking Gomer Pyle over here.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.043
He's queer, you know.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.811
Who's queer?

42:28.813 --> 42:31.114
The Gomer Pyle guy, Jim Nabors.

42:31.116 --> 42:34.217
Him and that Rock Hudson,
they're queers together.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.619
Did you go to school
on the short bus?

42:36.621 --> 42:38.855
Rock Hudson is not queer.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.924
Is too, him and that Nabors.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.992
He could be.
He's a good singer, that Nabors.

42:44.563 --> 42:46.963
Hey, hey, hey.

42:46.965 --> 42:50.166
What, you don't tell your
old man what's going on no more?

42:50.168 --> 42:52.101
What are you two
knuckleheads doing?

42:52.103 --> 42:53.703
Going out.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.204
And what are you gonna do?

42:55.206 --> 42:56.272
Hang around.

42:56.274 --> 42:58.074
And when are you coming back?

42:58.076 --> 42:59.609
Later.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.110
There. Was that so hard?

43:03.114 --> 43:06.349
Heh. I like to give it to 'em.
Bastards.

43:06.351 --> 43:09.085
Isn't he dead, that Gomer Pyle?

43:09.087 --> 43:10.653
I don't think so.

43:10.655 --> 43:13.089
Are you sure?
Hoss Cartwright's dead.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.692
Will you shut the fuck up?

43:15.694 --> 43:18.127
Hoss Cartwright's dead?

43:18.129 --> 43:22.932
<i>¶ We get it on</i>
<i>Most every night ¶</i>

43:22.934 --> 43:26.235
<i>¶ When that moon gets big</i>
<i>And bright ¶</i>

43:26.237 --> 43:30.106
So, Dunph, you getting any
up there?

43:30.108 --> 43:33.176
Well, there's this one girl.
She's pretty cool.

43:33.178 --> 43:34.944
How's her helmet?

43:34.946 --> 43:36.679
Incredible.

43:36.681 --> 43:38.181
Prettiest girl in the school.

43:38.183 --> 43:39.215
Her toilet?

43:39.217 --> 43:40.883
Perfect.

43:40.885 --> 43:42.285
Big fun bags?

43:42.287 --> 43:44.320
Nah, but nice ones.

43:44.322 --> 43:45.888
Are you porking her?

43:45.890 --> 43:47.991
No.

43:47.993 --> 43:50.293
I don't even care
if I bang her.

43:50.295 --> 43:52.362
It don't matter.

43:52.364 --> 43:54.263
I like her.

43:54.265 --> 43:57.233
Come on, what do you mean
it don't matter?

43:57.235 --> 43:59.702
I mean... No, I'm just saying,

43:59.704 --> 44:02.872
You can treat her like a guy.

44:02.874 --> 44:06.909
What, you mean, she don't freak
out if you bust her balls?

44:06.911 --> 44:11.014
No, not at all.
She's a good chick.

44:11.016 --> 44:14.083
Huh. She sounds like
a cool mule.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.219
You know, a real classy broad.

44:16.221 --> 44:17.887
Classy broad?

44:17.889 --> 44:19.288
You wouldn't know
a classy broad

44:19.290 --> 44:21.730
if she took a dump
on your head.

44:25.797 --> 44:27.930
Ah, I don't know.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.766
I mean, it just don't figure,
you know?

44:29.768 --> 44:31.768
Guy like Rock Hudson

44:31.770 --> 44:33.436
he could have any broad
in the world he wanted.

44:33.438 --> 44:36.172
Well you know what that is?
It's a sickness.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.908
It's a mental disturbance
caused by his mother.

44:38.910 --> 44:41.344
It's a sin is what it is,
period.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.913
Who gives a shit?
So he's gay. Big deal.

44:43.915 --> 44:47.216
Big deal? What's that mean,
"big deal"?

44:47.218 --> 44:48.951
Why do you give a fuck anyway?

44:48.953 --> 44:51.154
Doesn't affect you.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.189
I mean, I could see
if Raquel Welch was lezzie.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.824
But what do you
give a shit about him?

44:54.826 --> 44:58.327
I just do. Why, you don't?

44:58.329 --> 45:00.863
No, I don't.

45:04.069 --> 45:06.803
Hey, well,
if that don't bother you,

45:06.805 --> 45:08.204
maybe you're a femme too.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.007
All right, already.
Somebody pick a card.

45:11.009 --> 45:13.476
Wait a second.
I gotta hear this now.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.912
I mean, we're laying our cards
on the thing here, right?

45:15.914 --> 45:20.383
Joey, do you or don't you

45:20.385 --> 45:22.785
take it in the jaw?

45:24.422 --> 45:26.889
Shut the fuck up
for fuck's sake!

45:26.891 --> 45:28.491
What? Wait a second!

45:28.493 --> 45:31.227
Guy's never been married.
You ever seen him with a broad?

45:33.732 --> 45:37.100
What if I was?
Would that change something?

45:37.102 --> 45:39.235
You afraid I'd come on to you
all of a sudden,

45:39.237 --> 45:41.270
start playing
grab-ass with you?

45:42.741 --> 45:45.241
Just answer the question, okay?

45:45.243 --> 45:48.745
Are you now,
or have you ever been,

45:48.747 --> 45:50.980
a gay?

46:00.258 --> 46:03.793
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

46:07.365 --> 46:11.868
He's fucking busting our balls.

46:11.870 --> 46:15.104
He means he's gay like,
different.

46:15.106 --> 46:16.906
Right?

46:19.110 --> 46:21.010
Is that it?

46:21.012 --> 46:23.446
I mean, "gay" is that
what you mean?

46:23.448 --> 46:25.448
"Gay," like different?

46:25.450 --> 46:28.551
Or "gay" like:

46:40.465 --> 46:43.166
Oh, I can't help you out there
at all.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.233
You're on your own.

46:48.573 --> 46:51.307
Get the fuck out of here!

46:57.482 --> 46:59.816
Anyone else got
any confessions?

47:11.496 --> 47:13.896
She moves pretty well
for a big woman.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.034
Not in the fucking house
with those things.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.556
How many times
do I got to tell you?

47:21.039 --> 47:22.171
That's what you get.

47:22.173 --> 47:24.207
Thanks for the album, Pop.

47:24.209 --> 47:25.308
I've been wanting this.

47:25.310 --> 47:27.410
That there's a double album,

47:27.412 --> 47:29.545
and it's from me
and Jackie too.

47:29.547 --> 47:32.882
Or Jackie and me, whatever.

47:32.884 --> 47:34.483
You're the student.
Which is it?

47:37.121 --> 47:39.255
Either one,

47:39.257 --> 47:41.297
so long as you're referring
to an object.

47:44.863 --> 47:46.229
Thanks, Jackie.

47:46.231 --> 47:48.631
God, she dropped
the thing there.

47:48.633 --> 47:50.533
You see that?

48:08.052 --> 48:11.387
<i>It was hard to think about</i>
<i>my mother at Christmastime.</i>

48:11.389 --> 48:15.291
<i>But it was even harder</i>
<i>not to think about her.</i>

48:18.396 --> 48:21.964
<i>¶ Well, way up north</i>
<i>Where the air gets cold ¶</i>

48:21.966 --> 48:23.566
<i>¶ There's a tale about</i>
<i>Christmas ¶</i>

48:23.568 --> 48:25.501
<i>That you've all been told ¶</i>

48:25.503 --> 48:28.971
¶<i> And a real famous cat</i>
<i>All dressed up in red ¶</i>

48:28.973 --> 48:32.341
<i>¶ And he spends the whole year</i>
<i>Working out on his sled ¶</i>

48:32.343 --> 48:34.543
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

48:36.347 --> 48:38.547
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

48:40.385 --> 48:43.552
<i>¶ Just a little bobsled</i>
<i>We call it old Saint Nick ¶</i>

48:43.554 --> 48:47.423
<i>¶ But she'll walk a toboggan</i>
<i>With a four-speed stick ¶</i>

48:47.425 --> 48:51.227
<i>¶ She's candy-apple red</i>
<i>With a ski for a wheel ¶</i>

48:51.229 --> 48:54.563
<i>¶ And when Santa gives her gas,</i>
<i>Man, just watch her peel ¶</i>

48:54.565 --> 48:56.432
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

48:58.236 --> 49:00.102
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

49:02.073 --> 49:05.207
Having fun, Dildo?

49:05.209 --> 49:07.944
Yeah. Ah.
I can't do this tie thing.

49:07.946 --> 49:10.079
I feel like a retard at school

49:10.081 --> 49:12.515
wearing a clip-on. Everyone
else, they wear real ties.

49:12.517 --> 49:15.518
I look like a...
Look like a bozo.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.454
Relax. Just relax for a second.

49:18.456 --> 49:21.290
Here. Let me see this here.

49:21.292 --> 49:23.426
Necktie.

49:23.428 --> 49:26.395
Got the wide side,
you got the skinny side.

49:26.397 --> 49:28.698
Wide, left. Skinny, right.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.600
Now, count down
from the collar.

49:31.602 --> 49:35.304
One, two, three, four.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.306
Skinny side, you draw it down

49:37.308 --> 49:40.142
just below that fourth button,
all right?

49:40.144 --> 49:42.979
Now, take the wide side.

49:42.981 --> 49:46.148
You come over once, then under.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.616
Come over twice.

49:49.620 --> 49:51.253
You paying attention here?

49:51.255 --> 49:52.755
Yeah. Ahem.

49:52.756 --> 49:54.256
All right. You throw it over,
then you come through here.

49:54.258 --> 49:56.993
That hole, right?

49:56.995 --> 49:59.595
The worm comes
through the hole,

49:59.597 --> 50:02.298
then right down
into that little fold you made

50:02.300 --> 50:04.000
right there like that.
You see that?

50:04.002 --> 50:06.335
You're always keeping it tight,
all right?

50:06.337 --> 50:08.337
How old was she then?

50:12.643 --> 50:15.378
She was young.
I... I don't remember.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.079
Now pay attention here.

50:17.081 --> 50:18.614
Yeah.

50:18.615 --> 50:20.148
Keeping it tight,
nice and tight.

50:20.151 --> 50:21.450
Now, when you're done,

50:21.452 --> 50:23.452
if you've done
your job properly,

50:23.454 --> 50:25.621
you're gonna have this V
right here like that.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.357
They call that the vicious V.
The broads really love that.

50:28.359 --> 50:29.792
All right? All right.

50:29.794 --> 50:32.728
There you are. It's easy.
You give it a shot.

50:32.730 --> 50:35.064
All right.

50:46.544 --> 50:48.411
Jizz!

50:48.413 --> 50:50.479
Would you relax, man?

50:50.481 --> 50:52.581
Worse than my 80-year-old grand
crack.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.683
You're gonna jinx us all.

50:54.685 --> 50:57.186
Wheeler.

50:57.188 --> 50:59.188
Don't call him Jizz.

51:03.361 --> 51:05.661
I gotta bolt. You guys be cool.

51:07.598 --> 51:09.698
I got you a Christmas present.

51:14.539 --> 51:18.641
Springsteen.<i> Asbury Park.</i>

51:18.643 --> 51:21.377
You know, my friend
saw him live in a bar once.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.312
Really? Mm-hmm.

51:23.314 --> 51:25.748
And this is great.
Thanks a lot.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.149
Sure.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.587
Oh.

51:35.293 --> 51:37.493
Here.

51:46.604 --> 51:49.672
Dunph, it's beautiful.

51:49.674 --> 51:51.340
Double roach clips.

51:51.342 --> 51:52.708
Cool.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.445
Yeah, I got it at the dentist.

51:59.584 --> 52:02.852
<i>¶ All right now ¶</i>

52:02.854 --> 52:05.888
<i>¶ Baby, it's all right now ¶</i>

52:05.890 --> 52:07.840
<i>Greetings, Dunphy.</i>

52:07.841 --> 52:09.791
<i>Did you know that if you</i>
<i>stretched out your intestines,</i>

52:09.794 --> 52:10.860
<i>they'd reach the moon?</i>

52:10.862 --> 52:12.761
<i>It's a fact.</i>

52:12.763 --> 52:15.731
<i>It's exactly 10,000 miles from</i>

52:15.733 --> 52:17.800

52:17.802 --> 52:21.170

<i>because everything's good.</i>

52:25.443 --> 52:27.710
Oh, shit! Whoa!

52:27.712 --> 52:29.645
Aah, Jesus!

52:31.482 --> 52:32.748
Whoa!

52:37.321 --> 52:38.387
You all right, Jack?

52:38.389 --> 52:39.889
Yeah, I'm all right.

52:39.891 --> 52:41.590
Oh, shit.

52:41.592 --> 52:44.627
<i>¶ All right now ¶</i>

52:44.629 --> 52:47.630
<i>¶ Baby, it's all right now ¶</i>

52:49.800 --> 52:51.367
What's up?

52:51.369 --> 52:53.602
Your room got raided.
Fundy got them all.

52:53.604 --> 52:56.172
Wheeler, Irving, Billy Fu,
all of them.

52:56.174 --> 52:58.307
Oh, shit!

52:58.309 --> 53:00.576
Hey, Irv,
Brackett told me what happened.

53:00.578 --> 53:02.878
I can't believe it.
How'd you make out?

53:02.880 --> 53:06.248
Not bad.
Twelve hours plus probation.

53:06.250 --> 53:10.386
My parents are probably getting
a divorce over it.

53:10.388 --> 53:12.321
Could've been worse.

53:12.323 --> 53:14.523
What about the other guys?

53:14.525 --> 53:16.192
Same.

53:17.461 --> 53:20.329
Hey, Dunphy, let's go!

53:20.331 --> 53:22.965
This sucks, Irv. Really sucks.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.642
What are you doing?

53:33.644 --> 53:35.678
Studying.

53:35.680 --> 53:38.681
In case you hadn't noticed,
Funderburk is on the war path.

53:38.683 --> 53:40.516
Besides,
you have a test tomorrow.

53:40.518 --> 53:41.884
So?

53:41.886 --> 53:44.453
So you need to study.
So put that away.

53:44.455 --> 53:46.589
No, this will help us
concentrate.

53:46.591 --> 53:48.958
No, I'm serious.

53:48.960 --> 53:53.295
I always do better at the
studying thing when I'm stoned.

53:53.297 --> 53:55.464
It does something
to the brain cells, really.

53:55.466 --> 53:57.766
I'm... I'm not joking around
here. It like, it makes...

53:57.768 --> 54:01.637
Dunph, you haven't had better
than a D since you've been here.

54:01.639 --> 54:03.439
And that's because
there's no good weed around.

54:03.441 --> 54:06.342
It's terrible.

54:06.344 --> 54:07.676
I don't understand you.

54:07.678 --> 54:10.312
You're already
into this Brown University.

54:10.314 --> 54:13.449
Why don't you just try and relax
and enjoy yourself?

54:13.451 --> 54:15.718
Because it's not
about getting in.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.820
It's about doing well.

54:17.822 --> 54:20.289
You know, I busted my butt
for four years

54:20.291 --> 54:21.657
to get into that place.

54:21.659 --> 54:23.926
And it's not just so I could
say, "I go to Brown."

54:23.928 --> 54:25.761
It's because I want to learn.

54:25.763 --> 54:28.464
I want...
I want to challenge myself.

54:28.466 --> 54:30.833
I like that.

54:33.771 --> 54:36.772
All right.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.675
All right, you win, but if we're
gonna do all this studying,

54:39.677 --> 54:42.845
we got to have, like,
one final, like, thing,

54:42.847 --> 54:44.647
like, big blowout.

54:44.649 --> 54:47.283
And it's got to be
in Pawtucket.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.855
<i>¶ I like to dream ¶</i>

54:52.857 --> 54:55.924
<i>¶ Yes, yes, right between</i>
<i>My sound machine ¶</i>

55:13.444 --> 55:15.010
This stuff's kind of harsh,
right?

55:15.012 --> 55:17.346
I'm all right.

55:17.348 --> 55:19.915
Here. Take one of these.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.650
What is it?

55:21.652 --> 55:23.052
Vitamin Q.

55:23.054 --> 55:24.987
Relaxes your throat.

55:24.989 --> 55:26.989
<i>¶ Close your eyes, girl ¶</i>

55:26.991 --> 55:30.059
<i>¶ Look inside, girl ¶</i>

55:33.898 --> 55:36.699
So, how come you never talk
about your mother?

55:39.370 --> 55:41.770
I don't know.

55:41.772 --> 55:44.006
I guess 'cause she's dead.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.841
Oh! Dunph...

55:45.843 --> 55:48.043
Don't worry about it.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.912
I was little.

55:49.914 --> 55:53.082
You know, Jackie doesn't even
remember her.

55:53.084 --> 55:55.084
But you do?

55:55.086 --> 55:58.620
Well, you know,
bits and pieces.

56:00.758 --> 56:02.658
You know,
I remember the day she died,

56:02.660 --> 56:05.861
she cooked this big
turkey dinner,

56:05.863 --> 56:08.430
you know, with stuffing
and mashed potatoes

56:08.432 --> 56:10.933
and cranberry sauce.

56:13.371 --> 56:15.738
You know,
it wasn't even Thanksgiving.

56:17.575 --> 56:19.441
Was she sick?

56:19.443 --> 56:21.377
Yeah.

56:21.379 --> 56:23.946
You know, just sick of...

56:23.948 --> 56:29.718
of everything.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.788
<i>¶ I miss Alabama once again,</i>
<i>And I think it's a sin, yes ¶</i>

56:32.790 --> 56:36.125
I don't get it.
It don't make sense.

56:36.127 --> 56:39.161
See, there's this guy,

56:39.163 --> 56:41.730
and he's looking back
on his life.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.882
Right.

56:43.883 --> 56:46.033
And he sees these two sets
of footprints in the sand.

56:46.036 --> 56:49.438
Sort of like he had been walking
all along with God.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.906
But then the guy looks,

56:50.908 --> 56:54.009
and he notices
that during the tough times,

56:54.011 --> 56:56.078
there's only one set of prints.

56:56.080 --> 56:58.046
So, the guy says to God,

56:58.048 --> 57:01.183
"why did you desert me
when I needed you most?"

57:01.185 --> 57:03.919
and God says, "no, dummy,

57:03.921 --> 57:05.954
"when you saw
only one set of prints,

57:05.956 --> 57:08.690
that was
when I was carrying you."

57:10.528 --> 57:14.596
Ohh, fucking God, man.

57:14.598 --> 57:16.598
He's all right, you know?

57:27.111 --> 57:29.077
Irving, move.

57:29.079 --> 57:31.680
I got next game.

57:31.682 --> 57:33.482
Okay, fine, you got next game.

57:33.484 --> 57:37.186
No, I called next game
the last game.

57:37.188 --> 57:38.720
It's my turn.

57:38.722 --> 57:41.924
Kid, just move,
you're shit-faced.

57:41.926 --> 57:45.928
<i>I'm</i> shit-faced?!

57:45.930 --> 57:48.897
Hey, pud, you better move
your ass fast

57:48.899 --> 57:51.166
'cause I'm about to throw
this fuckin' dart.

57:51.168 --> 57:54.169
Ohh, is that right?

57:54.171 --> 57:57.706
You're gonna throw
the fuckin' dart!

58:01.212 --> 58:04.179
Dunph? Dunph, take it out.

58:04.181 --> 58:06.715
Take it out! Take it out!

58:06.717 --> 58:08.116
What the hell happened?

58:08.118 --> 58:09.818
I had next game.

58:19.129 --> 58:22.064
So you got any girlfriends,
Jackie?

58:22.066 --> 58:25.200
Oh, yeah. I'm going out with
a couple of Playboy bunnies.

58:25.202 --> 58:28.170
You're a good-looking guy. Why
couldn't you have a girlfriend?

58:28.172 --> 58:29.771
I don't know.

58:29.773 --> 58:31.840
I guess I could.

58:31.842 --> 58:34.576
But I'm just sort of playing
the field right now.

58:36.013 --> 58:37.779
Ew.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.915
Irv, what the fuck?

58:39.917 --> 58:41.683
Funkadelic.

58:42.920 --> 58:44.920
You just yorked on me.

58:44.922 --> 58:48.056
He did?

58:48.058 --> 58:50.559
Your friends from Pawtucket
seemed really nice.

58:50.561 --> 58:52.895
Yeah. Yeah, they're good guys.

58:52.897 --> 58:55.163
Now, remember, Dunph,
we had a deal.

58:55.165 --> 58:56.999
You have to hold up your end
of the bargain.

58:57.001 --> 58:58.734
I know. I know.

58:58.736 --> 59:00.736
<i>¶ Down around the corner ¶</i>

59:00.738 --> 59:02.771
<i>¶ Half a mile from here ¶</i>

59:02.773 --> 59:04.840
<i>¶ See them long trains run ¶</i>

59:04.842 --> 59:06.241
<i>¶ And you watch 'em disappear ¶</i>

59:06.243 --> 59:08.277

59:09.947 --> 59:11.780

59:25.329 --> 59:27.563
<i>¶ Down along the tracks ¶</i>

59:27.565 --> 59:30.566
Yeah, I could hardly believe it
myself, Mr. Dunphy.

59:30.568 --> 59:34.069
Looks like somebody's gonna have
a good spring break.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.573
<i>¶ Where would you be</i>
<i>Right now ¶</i>

59:39.577 --> 59:44.313
¶<i> Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve? ¶</i>

<i>¶ Without love ¶</i>

59:58.829 --> 01:00:01.263
<i>¶ Where would you be now? ¶</i>

01:00:03.801 --> 01:00:08.704
<i>¶ Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve? ¶</i>

01:00:20.217 --> 01:00:24.286
Don't! Dunphy!

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:26.054
Aah!

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.967
<i>¶ Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve ¶</i>

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:44.039
<i>After six glorious days</i>
<i>in the sun,</i>

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.907
<i>we ran out of Jane's money.</i>

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:48.143
<i>So, I dropped her off</i>
<i>in Virginia</i>

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:50.045
<i>and thumbed it back</i>
<i>to Pawtucket.</i>

01:00:50.047 --> 01:00:51.927
<i>I couldn't wait</i>
<i>to tell the guys.</i>

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:59.021
Well, if it ain't
beach-blanket bingo.

01:00:59.023 --> 01:01:01.890
What are you doin' here?

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.326
I ran into that knucklehead,
Tommy the Wire.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:07.663
He told me you were gonna
be here. You're late.

01:01:07.665 --> 01:01:10.999
Shorty, two more of these.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.451
So, what's the story?

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:31.219
I went to Florida.

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:34.990
I know you went to Florida.
Everyone wants to go to Florida.

01:01:34.992 --> 01:01:36.291
You should've told me.

01:01:36.293 --> 01:01:37.926
I didn't think you'd let me go.

01:01:37.928 --> 01:01:41.797
Fuckin' A right,
I wouldn't have let you go.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:49.371
Is this your first martini?

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.174
Yeah... today.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:58.780
All right.

01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:03.018
I'm gonna put the cards
on the table.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:06.154
You always come first with me.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:09.491
Anything I ever done was for you
and your brother.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:11.026
You remember that.

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:18.133
All right.

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:20.001
We're puttin' our cards
on the table here...

01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:22.370
how come you never told me
about Mom?

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.272
You always think
I'm out to screw you.

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:25.974
No, Pop.

01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:27.476
I never said that.

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:29.311
Yeah, but you think it.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.079
And you think it's my fault

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:33.148
your blessed mother
shot herself.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.451
God knows I tried to help her.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.254
She was a young girl
when we got married,

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.257
not much older
than you are now.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.092
What are you, 18, 19?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:45.894
Seventeen.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.765
Seventeen.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:52.501
That's a great age to be.

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.972
You never seen such a beauty.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.840
Not like these broads
you guys run with now

01:02:58.842 --> 01:03:01.003
with all the shit
on their face.

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.446
Your mother.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:06.248
Oh, boy.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.186
All the time
she got depressed, though,

01:03:11.188 --> 01:03:13.321
no matter how happy
she really was.

01:03:13.323 --> 01:03:17.225
Then you come along,

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:19.828
this wriggly, little thing
I couldn't even recognize.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:30.105
I bawled my eyes out
the night you were born.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:32.474
Thought everything
would be good.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.278
You want another one?

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.579
I'll have a beer.

01:03:37.581 --> 01:03:41.483
Shorty, one more for me
and a beer for Dildo.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:43.285
Do me a favor.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:45.420
Don't call me Dildo in public.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:49.825
It's a joke.

01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:53.261
What's the matter? You think
I don't love you no more?

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.429
Come over here
and give me a hug.

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:55.597
Pop...

01:03:58.268 --> 01:03:59.935
What, you're afraid
to hug your old man?

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:02.137
No, it's bullshit. What?

01:04:02.139 --> 01:04:03.605
I said it's bullshit!

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.407
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.209
Then stop lyin' to me.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:09.411
I know you were divorcing Mom
when she shot herself.

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:11.079
You don't know nothin'!

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.355
Hey...

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:22.591
hey!

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:29.965
Your mother loved you
and Jackie.

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:31.433
That's all you got to know.

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:36.938
Life isn't
a fuckin' fairy tale, buddy,

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.074
I got news for you.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:42.944
It isn't easy being Ozzie
when you ain't got a Harriet.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.313
And I loved your mother.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:48.049
But I couldn't live with her
after a while.

01:04:48.051 --> 01:04:50.518
She made me nuts, okay?
Is that what you want to hear?

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:57.626
It was stupid to get married.
We weren't made for each other.

01:04:57.628 --> 01:05:00.262
But I loved her at first sight.

01:05:00.264 --> 01:05:03.164
And I was an idiot about it.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:08.203
I wanted her to be something
that she couldn't be.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:09.971
The woman...

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.376
The woman was mentally ill.

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.979
She was afraid of life.

01:05:17.981 --> 01:05:19.614
She wouldn't even
leave the house.

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:23.251
For God's sake, she never even
learned how to drive a car.

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:25.420
It made me crazy.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:28.490
Almost seven years together,

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:31.927
you know how many times
we went out?

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:35.163
Once, one time. That's it.

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:44.706
And I guess
you'll never forgive me

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.788
till it happens to you, huh?

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.213
Timothy...

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:58.620
well, I hope
you never forgive me.

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:23.071
You gonna eat that whole thing?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:25.240
I'm just pickin'.

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:29.411
You know that was full
this morning.

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:32.247
Good stuff.

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:35.250
Supposed to have all-natural
preservatives or some shit.

01:07:35.252 --> 01:07:36.618
Hmm?

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.521
You should try
this other kind they got.

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.556
Heavenly Hash. Ho ho,<i> marron.</i>

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:44.526
You can't even find it.

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:47.495
I got to bribe the kid down
at Norm's to hide some for me.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:49.297
I'm, uh...

01:07:51.168 --> 01:07:54.169
I'm taking off, Pop.

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:57.539
That little girl
you're running with?

01:07:57.541 --> 01:07:59.541
Yeah, what about her?

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:02.677
You putting the wood to her?

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:03.845
What?

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.514
You think
I don't know what goes on?

01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:08.416
Let me tell you something.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.685
It's just as much
the guy's responsibility

01:08:10.687 --> 01:08:12.420
as it is the girl's.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:14.422
Don't go getting your little
friend there in trouble.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:17.591
I know.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:20.228
One more thing.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:25.600
Makin' sex is
like chinese dinner.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.671
It ain't over until you both
get your cookies, so...

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:32.273
remember I said that.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.642
All right.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.680
How 'bout a ride, huh?

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.499
Take care, Pop.

01:08:59.836 --> 01:09:02.670
Yeah. Be good.

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:06.140
Bottoms up, Tonto.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.509
There you go.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.310
There's the six and the two.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.279
If they don't land on the same
side of the board,

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:13.014
you roll again.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.747
Oh, no. You move six
and then you move two.

01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:16.584
That is the rule.
It's bullshit.

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:19.287
Shh, Jesus Christ, they're gonna
hear up at the girls' school.

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:20.721
Jizz, shut up.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:22.924
Don't call me that.

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:24.591
What, Jizz?

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:28.196
It's your fucking name.

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.665
Hey, come on, come on.
Roll again.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:36.770
What's my name?

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.707
It's Irving...

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:44.578
Jizz.

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:46.247
Are you fucking crazy?

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:50.350
All right, Irv.

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:51.920
Fuck you too, Wheeler.

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:53.488
All right, all right, all right.
All right, fellas.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:55.723
I'm gonna make a phone call.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:58.259
You want some?

01:09:58.261 --> 01:10:00.862
Come on, you crazy American,
you're making everything wet.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:05.633
Dunph! Dunph!

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:08.570
Hey! There you are!

01:10:08.572 --> 01:10:09.771
Yeah, where have you been?

01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:11.673
I've been at the fort
for over an hour.

01:10:24.955 --> 01:10:26.854
I'm sorry.

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.216
I got caught up
with these guys, you know?

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.926
So, come on. Let's go.

01:10:31.928 --> 01:10:33.861
Why don't you come up here?

01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:36.998
Yeah, right.
Just get your butt down here.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.234
Come on, Jane Weston.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:42.237
We'll just have a drink,
and then get out of here.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:46.007
There you go.

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:48.309
<i>¶ Doo doo doo ¶</i>

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:50.645
<i>¶ Doo doo doo-doo ¶</i>

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:55.383
<i>¶ Run, run, run ¶</i>

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:56.851
<i>¶ Doo doo doo-doo ¶</i>

01:10:56.853 --> 01:10:59.721
<i>¶ Run, run, run ¶</i>

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:01.956
<i>¶ You better ride on, baby ¶</i>

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:04.459
<i>¶ You were born outside</i>
<i>Of the... ¶</i>

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:09.297
I think you're in the wrong
building, young lady.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:12.700
Out... now.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.509
It would appear we have
a major situation,

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:23.278
wouldn't you say, gentlemen?

01:11:26.483 --> 01:11:28.283
Uh...

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:32.720
Billy, I was just comin' by to
see if you guys were studying.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.889
Well, I would advise you
to study somewhere else,

01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:36.691
Mr. Wheeler.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.926
Yes, sir.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.601
Well, you've left me no choice.

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:49.404
If I don't turn you in,
I'd be doing you a disservice.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:51.673
At some point later in life,

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:53.975
you'll be faced
with a similar situation.

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.512
And next time, hopefully,
you'll make the right decision.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.781
See, there are
no second chances in life.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.549
That's what you're learning
here today.

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.052
You control your own destiny.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:05.653
You're the one
who made the bed.

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:06.954
You're the one
who's got to sleep in it.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.756
You're the one
who made the boneheaded...

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:11.092
Oh, will you shut the fuck up?

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.064
I beg your pardon?

01:12:16.066 --> 01:12:18.800
You heard me.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:20.968
Ah, you've done it now, mister.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.738
Well, you were already gonna
boot us.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.840
What are you gonna do now?
Eat us?

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.776
Okay, Dunphy, let's go.

01:12:32.115 --> 01:12:34.582
Dunph, cool off, man.

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:37.485
Dunph... Take it easy, Dunph.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:45.059
Who do you think you are,
you insubordinate little twit?

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.862
Listen, Fundy, save the stuff.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.597
I know you can't boot us.

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:53.434
Oh? Please. Illuminate me.

01:12:53.436 --> 01:12:54.736
I know about Billy Fu.

01:12:54.738 --> 01:12:56.838
I know that his father
has committed $5 million

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.174
to this school,

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:01.509
all of which will be received
after Billy Fu graduates.

01:13:01.511 --> 01:13:04.879
Now, you probably figure
you'll let him slide

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.115
and rat the rest of us out.

01:13:07.117 --> 01:13:09.817
But if you do that,
I'll rat him out.

01:13:09.819 --> 01:13:12.887
I won't be blackmailed,
Mr. Dunphy.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.522
Fine.

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:16.758
Then we'll take a walk
down to Dean Mort's right now.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.160
You tell your side of the story,
I'll tell mine.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:20.561
Fair enough.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:23.398
I'll just show him the grass.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.634
Then he can call the cops.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:29.003
It's not like you were
5 miles up in the woods.

01:13:29.005 --> 01:13:31.873
You idiots were doing it
right here under my nose.

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:34.108
Now...

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:36.644
somebody's gonna pay the price.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:42.417
Okay, fine.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:45.720
There's only one person you want
to screw here anyway, right?

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:51.159
The rest of 'em get hours.

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:53.795
Thank you.

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:07.175
Dunph...

01:14:07.177 --> 01:14:10.044
I got nothin'.

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:12.547
That's... That's what we got.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:17.518
I mean, you know,
probation and a bunch of hours.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.153
Oh, man, we all walk.

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:22.123
Oh, good Christ.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:29.831
Jane, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.532
I'm so sorry.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:32.867
I'll go to the D.C.

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.735
I'll tell him the truth,
that you weren't even...

01:14:34.737 --> 01:14:36.938
Dunph, I was caught red-handed

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:40.074
in the boys' dormitory
with booze and pot.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:41.008
It's over.

01:14:42.912 --> 01:14:44.712
I feel so bad, you know.

01:14:44.714 --> 01:14:47.248
They spent so much money,
and now I can't get in anywhere.

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.183
Forget Brown University.

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:52.086
Of course you will.
You got the grades.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:55.656
Even if you got to start
at, like, a junior college.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.125
You don't get it, Dunph.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.497
I'm sorry.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:05.833
Jane...

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.535
I got to go.

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:16.744
It's not all your fault.
I didn't have to listen to you.

01:15:16.746 --> 01:15:19.146
Goodbye.

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:22.083
Janie...

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:46.541
<i>¶ Ahhhhh ¶</i>

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:50.144

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.992
Mr. Dunphy?

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:39.293
Mr. Dunphy!

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.128
Yeah?

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.830
Hey!

01:16:44.834 --> 01:16:48.769
Last night,
there was a car accident,

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:53.674
and your... Your friend
Drugs Delaney...

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:56.310
I'm very sorry.

01:16:59.716 --> 01:17:02.149
Oh, man.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:11.692
<i>¶ If I leave here tomorrow ¶</i>

01:17:14.097 --> 01:17:18.899

<i>Remember me? ¶</i>

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:27.742

<i>¶ 'Cause there's too many</i>

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:36.817
I want to say something
about Drugs.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.754
Drugs was a good shit.

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:44.859
Wire, you got anything to say?

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:49.797
That fucking guy
could party, man.

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:53.834
When everybody took one,
he took two.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.356
Nobody could take
that away from him.

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.973
Decenz,
you've got anything to say?

01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:01.342
Nah.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.110
Tommy said it all.

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:05.746
What the fuck?

01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:08.849
¶ ...bird you cannot change ¶

01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:12.019
¶ Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, oh ¶

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:16.290
¶ And the bird
You cannot change ¶

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.226
<i>I wanted to be alone,</i>

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:23.130
<i>but being alone made me think</i>
<i>about Drugsie...</i>

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:25.332
<i>Crazy bastard.</i>

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.234
<i>I wondered, if there was</i>
<i>a heaven and hell,</i>

01:18:27.236 --> 01:18:28.436
<i>which one he'd go to.</i>

01:18:28.438 --> 01:18:30.838
<i>Eh, I hate to even say it,</i>

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.875
<i>but I couldn't see drugs</i>
<i>up there with all those saints.</i>

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:40.715
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe he'll get lucky.</i>

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:45.052
<i>Maybe after you die,</i>
<i>there's just nothin'.</i>

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:47.888
Huh.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.757
Will you throw
your fucking card?

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:51.025
Oh, it's my turn again?

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:53.828
Yeah, it's a rotation thing,
Einstein. Come on.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:57.331
You're holding trump
again, you cockfucker.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.734
So now it's my fault?

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:17.786
<i>Before going back to Cornwall,</i>

01:19:17.787 --> 01:19:20.221
<i>there was something I knew</i>
<i>I had to take care of.</i>

01:19:23.025 --> 01:19:25.426
- Brown University.
- Dean Rogers' office.

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:28.496
Could I ask you to hold just one
moment, please, sir? Thank you.

01:19:28.498 --> 01:19:30.097
May I help you?

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:34.034
I need to speak
to Mr. Jonathan S. Rogers Jr.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:35.936
Do you have an appointment?

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:37.338
No, but...

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:40.007
you don't understand.
I really need to talk to him.

01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:42.343
You really need
to have an appointment.

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:44.378
But I don't have one.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.280
Would you like to make one?

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.283
Please? This is very important.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:52.086
It could mean the difference
between this girl's whole life.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:54.789
Dean Rogers' schedule
is entirely filled today.

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:56.924
You need an appointment
to see him.

01:19:56.926 --> 01:19:58.859
I'm sorry.

01:19:58.861 --> 01:20:01.328
Thank you for holding, sir.

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.431
What day did you want
to come in?

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:06.934
The 18th should be fine.

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.285
I know I don't have
an appointment,

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:25.986
but you have
to give me a chance.

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:27.555
It's like life or death.
Jane Weston...

01:20:27.557 --> 01:20:29.824
the whole thing,
it wasn't her fault.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:32.193
I'm the one.
It's... It's all me.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:33.994
It's not fair.
You have to believe me.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.564
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:39.500
Cornwall Academy.
Mr. Funderburk.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:43.037
Please, sir, just let me in,

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.371
and I'll...
I'll explain everything.

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:46.240
Please?

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:48.576
One minute. Come on in.

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.380
It was all just
this big mistake, and...

01:20:53.382 --> 01:20:54.448
Good Lord.

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:57.051
...and this Jane Weston,

01:20:57.053 --> 01:20:59.086
she's, like, the smartest girl
in the whole school.

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:00.921
You can't...

01:21:00.923 --> 01:21:02.890
Sir, I know
you're busy and everything

01:21:02.892 --> 01:21:05.159
'cause the lady
out there told me,

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:06.994
but I really appreciate this.

01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:09.496
Yes, I actually meant come in
through the door.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.234
You'd better take a seat.

01:21:16.272 --> 01:21:19.473
Yes, Mr. Dunphy,
Jane Weston was accepted,

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.609
but due to the facts
in Mr. Funderburk's letter,

01:21:21.611 --> 01:21:23.911
we reversed our decision.

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:28.148
Those weren't the facts.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:31.085
I know I'm probably not gonna
say this right,

01:21:31.087 --> 01:21:33.988
but the whole college thing,
to me...

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:37.358
I mean, I'm probably not even
gonna go to college.

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.294
But this girl's whole life
is gonna be ruined.

01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:42.463
Getting into
this Brown University thing,

01:21:42.465 --> 01:21:44.131
it means, like,
everything to her.

01:21:44.133 --> 01:21:47.635
I can see you're concerned about
this young lady's future.

01:21:47.637 --> 01:21:49.503
That's very commendable.

01:21:49.505 --> 01:21:51.639
But don't you think that people
should take responsibility

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:53.173
for their actions?

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:55.676
Yes, sir, they should.
And that's why I'm here.

01:21:55.678 --> 01:21:58.379
They were my actions.
It was my fault.

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:01.282
Someone else is getting blamed
for something I did,

01:22:01.284 --> 01:22:03.250
and it's just not right.

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:05.019
That's very noble, Mr. Dunphy.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.621
But chivalry's a tough sell
to the review board.

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:12.559
Dean Rogers...

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:15.095
is there one time in your life

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.165
when you made a mistake and you
wish you could take it back,

01:22:18.167 --> 01:22:21.201
'cause if you could,
it would change everything?

01:22:21.203 --> 01:22:24.405
Has that ever happened to you?

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:28.609
And if it has,

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:32.613
maybe you could get
the review board to review that.

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:45.092
This is it, boys.
It's almost over.

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:46.660
Hey, Irving.

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:58.672
Mental floss.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:00.674
You need help, man.

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:07.047
So, Fu, you got into Princeton.
What a surprise.

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:09.083
Crane and Keller
got into Ithaca.

01:23:09.085 --> 01:23:10.217
No way.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:12.186
Did you heard about Wheeler?

01:23:12.188 --> 01:23:13.253
He got into Yale.

01:23:13.255 --> 01:23:15.723
Yale?

01:23:15.725 --> 01:23:17.391
How the hell did
he get in there?

01:23:17.393 --> 01:23:18.692
Same way anyone does.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:20.995
Get a great recommendation
from Funderburk.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:22.162
Fundy's a big Yalie.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.064
He's got an in
with the admissions board.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:26.266
What about Calvert?
Did he get in anywhere?

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:28.669
Florida. University of Miami.

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.738
Ouch.

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:34.008
I heard you got into Yale.

01:23:35.745 --> 01:23:37.211
Yeah.

01:23:37.213 --> 01:23:39.313
Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable,
huh?

01:23:39.315 --> 01:23:42.082
Yeah, I guess.

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:44.251
Yeah.

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:47.588
Yeah.

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:50.257
Yeah.

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:54.661
Hey,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:57.698
What the fuck is that?

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:00.134
Lowlife piece of shit.

01:24:00.136 --> 01:24:03.170
Whoa. D-man...

01:24:03.172 --> 01:24:05.272
w-where's this coming from?

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:07.207
You got Jane booted.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.376
What are you talking about?

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.544
You ratted us out so Fundy would
give you a recommendation.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:14.415
That's bull. He gave a lot
of guys good recommendations.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:16.316
He busted you winter term.

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:19.053
In my room, he busted you.

01:24:19.055 --> 01:24:21.588
Why would he give you
a good one?

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:23.190
He gave it to me
before he busted me.

01:24:23.192 --> 01:24:24.458
He would have canceled it...

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:27.561
Called Yale and told them
what a stoner you were.

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:31.165
Maybe he forgot.

01:24:41.744 --> 01:24:43.277
Don't, Dunph.

01:24:43.279 --> 01:24:45.612
You little punk.
You fucked us all, man.

01:24:45.614 --> 01:24:47.581
Fuck, man,
this is totally uncool.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:48.816
You don't have
any fucking proof.

01:24:48.818 --> 01:24:50.584
Oh, proof?

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.486
Proof ain't gonna matter

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:54.387
when your head's cracked open
on the sidewalk down there.

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:55.622
Dunphy. Dunphy, take it easy.

01:24:55.624 --> 01:24:59.159
Take it easy, man. Dunph.

01:24:59.161 --> 01:25:01.862
Unh!

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:15.209
What's the point?

01:25:15.211 --> 01:25:17.744
Your life?

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:19.880
It's gonna suck anyway.

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:32.693
Dunph!

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.197
Huh.

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:40.400
Hey. Hey.

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:41.668
How'd you get here?

01:25:41.670 --> 01:25:44.271
I took my parents' car.

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:45.506
They let you?

01:25:45.508 --> 01:25:47.908
Come on down.

01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:50.177
Don't move.

01:26:01.157 --> 01:26:02.723
Hi.

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:04.791
Hi.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:14.201
J-Jane, I...

01:26:14.203 --> 01:26:17.404
I-I'm so sorry
about everything.

01:26:22.444 --> 01:26:24.411
You... You got back in.

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:36.857
I brought you a present.

01:26:36.859 --> 01:26:38.559
Hm?

01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:45.732
No.

01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:51.738
What? What's the matter?

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.307
Nothing.

01:26:54.476 --> 01:26:56.543
It's just...

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.780
I want to remember this moment.

01:27:01.483 --> 01:27:04.851
I... I don't want it to be hazy
'cause of this.

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:08.755
I want to savor it.

01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:12.259
You know, let it really sink in.

01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:15.295
So it'll always be there.

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:18.899
Okay, I got it.

01:27:18.901 --> 01:27:20.701
You can torch it now.

01:27:25.341 --> 01:27:28.976
<i>We stayed there all night</i>
<i>and it was really beautiful.</i>

01:27:28.978 --> 01:27:32.646
<i>We made plans to see each other</i>
<i>over the summer.</i>

01:27:32.648 --> 01:27:36.583
<i>Around dawn Jane nodded off,</i>
<i>but I couldn't sleep.</i>

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:40.721
<i>I was afraid that if I did,</i>
<i>I'd never feel that good again.</i>

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:54.268
Paul Patrick Baker.

01:27:56.505 --> 01:27:59.640
Patrick Michael Carey.

01:28:01.710 --> 01:28:05.512
Christian Robert Catt.

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:11.285
Gavin Patrick Curren.

01:28:11.287 --> 01:28:12.519
Congratulations.

01:28:12.521 --> 01:28:15.622
Steven Edward Delaney.

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:16.957
Congratulations.

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:20.494
Timothy Michael Dunphy.

01:28:31.674 --> 01:28:36.343
Rocky Wayne Fuller.

01:28:36.345 --> 01:28:37.511
Jonathan Beecher Glad...

01:28:37.513 --> 01:28:40.747
Hey, can you hand me
my luggage?

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:46.620
Peter Edward McNaught...

01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:49.656
Bryan Stewart.

01:28:55.564 --> 01:28:56.963
Hey, Dunph.

01:29:01.737 --> 01:29:03.704
Hey.

01:29:03.706 --> 01:29:06.006
What are you guys doing here?

01:29:06.008 --> 01:29:08.041
What the hell you think
we're doing here?

01:29:08.043 --> 01:29:10.577
You're graduating
from high school, ain't ya?

01:29:13.382 --> 01:29:16.383
Well, yeah, yeah, I guess.
I-it's just no big deal.

01:29:16.385 --> 01:29:17.751
What "no big deal"?

01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:18.953
I suppose you're gonna tell me

01:29:18.954 --> 01:29:21.788
that this is
no big deal, too, huh?

01:29:23.092 --> 01:29:24.591
What's this?

01:29:24.593 --> 01:29:26.660
You got in.

01:29:26.662 --> 01:29:29.529
W-what do you mean?

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:31.932
Don't play dumb with me.

01:29:31.934 --> 01:29:34.868
Rhode Island Junior College.
You got accepted.

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:38.905
Oh, yeah, uh...

01:29:38.907 --> 01:29:42.642
Well, actually...
there is no "accepted."

01:29:42.644 --> 01:29:44.764
You just have to sign up, Pop.

01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:49.082
Well, you filled out the forms.

01:29:49.084 --> 01:29:51.385
You showed
a little initiation there.

01:29:51.387 --> 01:29:56.523
You're gonna be the first Dunphy
to go to college.

01:29:56.525 --> 01:29:57.758
I'm proud of you.

01:30:00.929 --> 01:30:03.096
Shake my hand like a man there.

01:30:03.098 --> 01:30:05.465
What are you, a fucking
flounder? There you go.

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.569
Y-you know, Pop, maybe...

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:10.937
if I do real good here,

01:30:10.939 --> 01:30:12.639
I could get into, like,
a senior college.

01:30:12.641 --> 01:30:14.508
What's that?

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:17.711
Well, you know, like...
Well, like a regular college,

01:30:17.713 --> 01:30:19.579
where people sleep over
and shit.

01:30:19.581 --> 01:30:21.014
Oh.

01:30:21.016 --> 01:30:23.617
Dunph,
if you had done good here,

01:30:23.619 --> 01:30:25.519
you could have gotten
into a regular college.

01:30:25.521 --> 01:30:27.020
Shut up, you little hard-on.

01:30:27.022 --> 01:30:28.989
You're just jealous
because you're not gonna be

01:30:28.991 --> 01:30:30.690
the first Dunphy
to go to college.

01:30:30.692 --> 01:30:33.627
No, but I can still be
the first to graduate.

01:30:35.564 --> 01:30:36.897
You little ball buster.

01:30:38.967 --> 01:30:41.001
All right, you two ass-bags,
let's get the hell out of here.

01:30:41.003 --> 01:30:44.004
Shorty's got a pitcher
of beers waiting for us.

01:30:44.006 --> 01:30:46.873
So, Dildo, what ever happened
to that girlfriend of yours?

01:30:46.875 --> 01:30:48.975
She's going to Brown University
next year.

01:30:48.977 --> 01:30:51.878
Brown? They got one of those
in Providence, you know.

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.713
There's only one, Pop.

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:55.482
You hot shit.

01:30:55.484 --> 01:30:57.551
How do you think she's gonna
like riding around Providence

01:30:57.553 --> 01:30:58.985
in this shit box?

01:30:58.987 --> 01:31:00.854
She's gonna be Mrs. Dildo.

01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:02.722
Shut up, you little hard-on.

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:13.767
