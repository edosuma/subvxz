a polemicist, I'm a prophet,

03:06.882 --> 03:09.450
so drastically reduced,
Mr. Staples?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.147
FELIX:
One simple reason-- Chumhum.
Let's be honest.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.367
Chumhum is punishing me
for my beliefs.

03:13.541 --> 03:15.151
And what form
did this punishment take?

03:15.325 --> 03:17.371
Solomon Waltzer came to
this case late. Find out why.

just playing the ref?

05:28.502 --> 05:30.765
Is that a sports metaphor?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.854
By claiming bias

05:33.028 --> 05:35.726
against your right-wing speech,
aren't you just attempting

05:35.900 --> 05:38.163
to move Chumhum closer
to yet more bias

take long,

05:55.877 --> 05:57.357

some of the specifics. Brad?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.425
You should really have
a passcode on this.

10:00.600 --> 10:05.039
It's my small rebellion
against modern life.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.736
So, what do you want to know?

10:06.910 --> 10:10.435
You're taking all the fun
out of investigating.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.394
Well, we can make it a game.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.963
Why are you representing
an idiot like Felix Staples?

10:16.137 --> 10:18.705
It's a good free-speech case.

10:18.879 --> 10:20.576
Hate speech isn't free speech.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.013
I'm not talking about
Mr. Staples.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.189
I don't understand.

10:25.363 --> 10:28.410
One thing I've learned
in all my years doing this...

10:28.584 --> 10:31.500
the court case is
rarely about the client.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.415
It's about a statement?

10:33.589 --> 10:35.678
That's the game?

10:35.852 --> 10:38.376
You wanted it to be fun.

10:38.550 --> 10:42.206
[sighs] Put these in your ears
and they automatically turn on.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.470
Oh. Thank you.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.648
So, if it's not about
the client, who's it about?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
PM?

11:02.749 --> 11:05.055
You're not gonna tell me
what "PM" means?

11:05.229 --> 11:09.146
Ask Ms. Lamore.
She knows.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.806
They're working!

11:19.766 --> 11:21.115
ADRIAN:
"PM"? Well, what does that--

11:21.289 --> 11:22.682
What does that mean?He wouldn't say.

11:22.856 --> 11:24.858
He said ask Sheryl Lamore.
She would know.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.947
So, you don't throw up
before you go in?

11:27.121 --> 11:29.819
I-- Sorry, what?

11:29.993 --> 11:31.691
You don't throw up
before you go into court.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.258
No. You do?

11:34.432 --> 11:37.087
Yeah. In theater I did.

11:37.261 --> 11:40.569
Oh... Oh, okay.
Hey, wait.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.919
Mm...

11:45.748 --> 11:49.534
Oh, yeah.
This is your good side.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.320
I have a good side?Yeah, everyone does.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.582
Break a leg.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.410
Thanks.

11:57.499 --> 12:00.241
Now DJT, as I like to call him,
because he is my boo,

12:00.415 --> 12:03.113
DJT is trying to get
to the bottom of Crooked Hillary

12:03.287 --> 12:05.333
and Swampy Schumer's
dirty dealings.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.553
Mm-hmm. Dirty, double-crossing,
low-down dealing...

12:08.728 --> 12:11.861
And this weekly video log
of yours had

12:12.035 --> 12:15.430
a significant presence
on Chummy Video.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.475
Is that correct, Ms. Leather?Just Leather, baby.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.260
And Lace.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.914
Uh, can we hold the cross-talk,
please?

12:21.088 --> 12:23.830
You may continue, Le-Leather.Yes.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.571
We had significant presence,
until three months ago.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.443
SOLOMON:
And why is that?

12:28.617 --> 12:29.531
LEATHER:
'Cause she and her company
didn't like

12:29.705 --> 12:30.619
our political views.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.403
Mm-hmm!Uh, can we hold the

12:32.577 --> 12:34.275
"Mm-hmm," too, please?

12:34.449 --> 12:35.580
Billionaires want to keep
black folks

12:35.755 --> 12:37.495
on the Democratic plantation.

12:37.669 --> 12:41.108
Ms. Leather, were you ever told
the reason you were dropped

12:41.282 --> 12:42.892
from Chummy Video?

12:43.066 --> 12:45.286
Oh, they made up some nonsense
about hate speech.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.722
But my sister and me,

12:46.896 --> 12:48.811
we don't have a hating bone
in our bodies.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.987
It was our support of Trump.Objection.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.250
Uh, yes. Sustained.SOLOMON: Nothing
further, Your Honor.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.991
LUCCA: Uh, just a few
questions, Your Honor.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.994
You referred to...

13:02.433 --> 13:04.261
You referred

13:04.435 --> 13:07.047
to the Parkland High School
students as "crybabies."

13:07.221 --> 13:08.265
FARLEY:
Is that a question,

13:08.439 --> 13:09.701
Counselor?LUCCA:
Not yet.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.312
You said that, did you not?

13:11.486 --> 13:13.183
LEATHER:
We said people

13:13.357 --> 13:15.490
who blame everything on
the NRA are crybabies.

13:15.664 --> 13:18.449
Testify! [chuckles]No, Lace. Stop.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.713
Uh... [clears throat]

13:21.888 --> 13:24.325
And, ma'am, uh, when you said,

13:24.499 --> 13:27.197
"If a son of mine decided..."

13:27.371 --> 13:29.547
[stomach rumbling]Uh...

13:30.766 --> 13:32.072
[exhales]

13:32.246 --> 13:33.682
Are you all right, Counselor?

13:33.856 --> 13:35.684
Uh, yeah. I just need a moment,
Your Honor.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.077
FARLEY:
Sure.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.862
Want me to take this cross?

13:40.036 --> 13:42.996
No, I got it. I got it.I...

13:46.390 --> 13:49.176
[panting]

13:49.350 --> 13:51.613
[groans]

13:51.787 --> 13:54.790
Okay. Okay.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.401
What was that about?

13:57.575 --> 14:00.578
He says he throws up
before going on stage.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.190
Suddenly I feel like
th-throwing up.

14:03.364 --> 14:07.672
He talks about my good side,
and I'm all...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.979
Why do I give a shit
what he thinks?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.677
Just... Okay.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.115
Go back to your training.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.857
Your hours in court.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.033
[exhales]

14:21.948 --> 14:24.689
You're not some idiot actor.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.083
You're Lucca Quinn.

14:27.257 --> 14:30.173
You're fuckin' Clarence Darrow.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.045
"As long as the world
shall last,

14:32.219 --> 14:33.655
"there will be wrongs.

14:33.829 --> 14:36.745
"And if no man objected
and no man rebelled,

14:36.919 --> 14:39.966
those wrongs
would last forever."

14:40.140 --> 14:41.881
There you go.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.708
Impervious.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
Omnipotent.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.365
Ready to kill.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.890
This is not pretend.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.066
This is real.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.159
[clears throat]

14:59.333 --> 15:01.161
[door opens]

15:01.335 --> 15:03.163
You all right?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.208
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.515
Hey, do what I do.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.691
Just imagine everyone in there
without their clothes on.

15:09.865 --> 15:12.868
Gary, I-I need
to ask you a favor.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.479
Yeah, sure.Stay out of court.

15:15.653 --> 15:17.003
[clears throat] Why?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.614
I need to focus.Got it.

15:19.788 --> 15:20.920
Got it completely.[both chuckle]

15:21.094 --> 15:22.399
Kick some arse.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.575
[chuckles]

15:26.577 --> 15:28.449
Got it.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.059
Are you all right
now, Counselor?

15:30.233 --> 15:31.539
[clears throat]
I am, Your Honor.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.194
Because we can
delay for a day.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.936
Counselor?

15:43.377 --> 15:46.336
Do you have more questions,
Counselor?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.425
Uh...

15:51.515 --> 15:53.343
I do.

15:53.517 --> 15:56.129
I'm good.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.349
[clears throat] Uh...

16:00.394 --> 16:01.873
Ma'am...

16:04.572 --> 16:07.792
Ma'am, did you also say,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.359
"If a son of mine

16:09.533 --> 16:11.753
decided he was gay,
I would beat his ass"?

16:11.927 --> 16:14.364
[scoffs] That was a joke.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.713
Let's turn to your income,
Ms. Soloway.

16:15.887 --> 16:17.237
Leather.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.542
You know, actually,
your real name is Soloway,

16:18.716 --> 16:19.848
so I think I'll use that.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.328
LEATHER:
Your Honor,

16:21.502 --> 16:23.156
I would like to be referred to
as Leather.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.853
FARLEY: It's not up to you.LACE: Boo!

16:25.027 --> 16:29.075
Ben, would you escort Lace out
of the court, please?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.554
LACE: I'll be good.FARLEY: Oh, you will be good,

16:30.728 --> 16:32.730
but in the hall.LUCCA:
Ms. Soloway,

16:32.904 --> 16:36.604
what happened to your income
after Chumhum took you off

16:36.778 --> 16:38.780
its social media platforms?I have no idea.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.347
Well, you appeared
on Conservative TV

16:40.521 --> 16:43.219
only once before
they kicked you off Chumhum.

16:43.393 --> 16:44.264
How many times after?

16:44.438 --> 16:45.526
I-I don't recall.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.788
Well, is it possible
you've appeared

16:46.962 --> 16:48.833
25 times since being banned?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.922
I suppose so.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.100
Laura Ingraham introduced you
as "two black girls

16:54.274 --> 16:56.972
ground down by the bootheel
of political correctness."

16:57.146 --> 16:59.018
Is that accurate?

16:59.192 --> 17:01.585
That sounds like her.Your website sells

17:01.759 --> 17:03.370
coffee mugs, lawn signs,

17:03.544 --> 17:05.894
Volga River cruises
with Leather 'n' Lace,

17:06.068 --> 17:08.505
and you opened for Ted Nugent
in Branson.

17:08.679 --> 17:09.985
Objection. Relevance.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.639
LUCCA:
The relevance is
that these two women

17:11.813 --> 17:13.597
have suffered
zero negative consequences

17:13.771 --> 17:15.034
from Chumhum's action.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.993
In fact,
they have profited from it.

17:18.167 --> 17:21.170
Isn't that right,
Ms. Soloway?

17:21.344 --> 17:22.824
No further questions,
Your Honor.

17:22.998 --> 17:25.609
She's a star.Amen.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.829
NEWSMAN:
...full confirmation.
The unredacted...

17:28.003 --> 17:29.918
Hello, handsome.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.007
KURT:
How was your day?Ooh.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.357
...insist the report is real
and imminent.Better now.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.185
And might also include
a recording.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.534
NEWSMAN 2:
That's right, Tom.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.058
Sources in Justice
have suggested

17:39.232 --> 17:40.929
that this unconfirmed report

17:41.103 --> 17:43.149
might come in the form
of digital sound recordings,

17:43.323 --> 17:44.846
and some are even suggesting

17:45.020 --> 17:47.153
that this recording
might even include singing.

17:47.327 --> 17:49.198
TOM:
Singing? What kind of singing?

17:49.372 --> 17:51.070
NEWSMAN 2:
That's still unclear.
But many have pointed

17:51.244 --> 17:52.984
to the fact
that Vice President Pence

17:53.159 --> 17:54.943
has been known to hum the songs
from Wicked.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.597
KURT:
Everything all right?

17:56.771 --> 17:58.642
Uh, yes. Good.

17:58.816 --> 18:00.253
What was that?

18:00.427 --> 18:02.472
Oh, nothing.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.475
So, how was your day?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.216
[sighs]

18:07.390 --> 18:08.913
You told me I was
bad at lying.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.307
And it's true.

18:11.481 --> 18:13.048
But you're bad at it, too.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.876
What, this?

18:15.050 --> 18:18.445
[chuckles]: It's just something
I'm-I'm dealing with.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.452
What does "the hack" refer to?

18:26.496 --> 18:29.108
And who's "they"?

18:31.153 --> 18:33.068
Diane, we're not roommates.

18:33.242 --> 18:34.983
That was our agreement.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.116
We're in this together now,

18:37.290 --> 18:40.380
so if you're in danger,
I need to know.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.860
What does the hack refer to?

18:45.907 --> 18:48.779
First I need a drink.

18:48.953 --> 18:50.999
♪ ♪

19:23.945 --> 19:25.990
♪ ♪

19:51.146 --> 19:53.192
♪ ♪

20:41.370 --> 20:43.546
I'm part of a group.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.419
A political group.

20:46.593 --> 20:49.857
16 women.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.947
We are attempting
to undercut support

20:53.121 --> 20:54.992
for Trump in 2020.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.735
And this is someone
who wants to stop you?

20:58.909 --> 21:01.912
I think so.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.263
And the hack?

21:07.657 --> 21:09.485
I can't tell you.

21:09.659 --> 21:13.968
Kurt, there are
certain work things

21:14.142 --> 21:16.710
touching on politics
that you can't tell me.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.931
And there are certain things
touching on politics

21:21.105 --> 21:22.324
that I can't tell you.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.502
We have found a way

21:26.676 --> 21:30.941
to bifurcate our lives
and make it work.

21:31.115 --> 21:33.988
So trust me when I say I-I...

21:34.162 --> 21:36.295
I can't tell you.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.689
Is it dangerous?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.562
[thunder rumbling]

21:42.736 --> 21:45.129
I don't think so.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.349
If it is,

21:47.523 --> 21:49.830
I will overlook
politics to help.

21:55.749 --> 21:58.447
"Stop, Diane. They
know about the hack."

21:59.753 --> 22:01.581
What in the entire fuck?

22:01.755 --> 22:03.191
So someone knows about us?

22:03.365 --> 22:04.497
DIANE:
I don't know.Are we in trouble here?

22:04.671 --> 22:06.325
We don't know that.Could I see it?

22:10.111 --> 22:11.808
POLLY:
Is somebody
gonna say it out loud?

22:11.982 --> 22:13.419
We have a mole.

22:13.593 --> 22:14.724
To what end?
POLLY:
To stop us.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.117
DIANE: Anybody
wanted to stop us,

22:16.291 --> 22:17.466
all they'd have to do
is call the police.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.946
RACHELLE:
Maybe they don't want

22:19.120 --> 22:20.382
to stop us.
Maybe they just want to stop

22:20.556 --> 22:21.731

we've agreed to offer

46:22.780 --> 46:26.044
20 million.
But no more.

46:26.218 --> 46:27.132
[clicks tongue]

46:27.306 --> 46:29.308
No.

46:29.482 --> 46:31.397
That is double
what you wanted, Felix.That's before I heard

46:31.571 --> 46:33.007
about these reeducation camps.

46:33.181 --> 46:34.748
My God. Awful.

46:34.922 --> 46:36.663
You're so full of shit.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.665
Those are hateful words, Diane.

46:38.839 --> 46:40.101
SOLOMON:Mr. Staples and I have
very different ideologies,

46:40.275 --> 46:42.364
but on this we agree:

46:42.538 --> 46:44.627
you've operated unchecked

46:44.802 --> 46:46.934
far too long.

46:47.108 --> 46:48.588
20 million,

46:48.762 --> 46:51.112
and we'll agree to create
an independent tribunal,

46:51.286 --> 46:53.941
a social media Supreme Court,
to guide us toward

46:54.115 --> 46:56.683
greater transparency
and accountability.

46:58.728 --> 47:01.514
Put me on this tribunal,
and we'll consider it.

47:01.688 --> 47:03.908
And 28 million.[Diane laughs over phone]

47:04.082 --> 47:06.911
Sorry.
SOLOMON:
Call us

47:07.085 --> 47:09.174
when you decide.FELIX: Oh, hi,
Mr. Hannity, how are you?

47:09.348 --> 47:13.178
No, I'm wonderful.
I've never been better.

47:13.352 --> 47:16.050
Wonderful![laughs]

47:17.399 --> 47:20.663
Well, Mr. Gross
thinks we should pay him.

47:20.838 --> 47:24.276
Okay, we'll put together
the offer.Okay.

47:24.450 --> 47:26.104
Sheryl, before you go.

47:26.278 --> 47:30.325
Chumhum is our most
important client,

47:30.499 --> 47:32.632
Mm-hmm.and so we wanted
to warn you

47:32.806 --> 47:34.025
about something
that will be appearing

47:34.199 --> 47:35.504
in the news
in the next few weeks.

47:35.678 --> 47:37.332
Is this the #MeToo problem?

47:37.506 --> 47:40.248
ADRIAN: Right.Okay. What is it?

47:40.422 --> 47:43.686
Uh, my father,
over the course of ten years,

47:43.861 --> 47:47.081
forced his secretary
to perform oral sex on him.

47:47.255 --> 47:50.650
Uh, he apparently did
this with other women.

47:50.824 --> 47:53.131
We don't know how many.

47:55.220 --> 47:58.136
This is Carl Reddick,
the civil rights icon?

47:58.310 --> 48:00.051
Yeah.

48:00.225 --> 48:03.750
We'll be laying out all the
details to a friendly journalist

48:03.924 --> 48:06.492
within the week.Were there any attempts
to pay this woman off?

48:06.666 --> 48:08.233
Yes.

48:08.407 --> 48:09.843
That's not good.

48:10.017 --> 48:12.324
We know that.

48:12.498 --> 48:14.761
It's a very sensitive time.
We have a zero tolerance policy

48:14.935 --> 48:17.764
for workplace
sexual impropriety.

48:17.938 --> 48:19.940
We understand,
and we are cleaning house.

48:20.114 --> 48:21.376
Okay.

48:21.550 --> 48:23.204
Let me sit down with Neil Gross.

48:23.378 --> 48:25.119
He may just want to move on.Good.

48:25.293 --> 48:26.860
ADRIAN:
Good.

48:27.034 --> 48:30.690
Oh-- you-- uh... "Move on" as in
put this to the side?

48:30.864 --> 48:32.170
No.

48:32.344 --> 48:34.389
"Move on" as in
"go to another firm."

48:34.563 --> 48:36.914
But I'll get back to you.

48:41.396 --> 48:44.095
[sighs]

48:44.269 --> 48:45.357
RACHELLE:
Where's Liz?

48:45.531 --> 48:47.359
Oh, she's taking a break.

48:47.533 --> 48:48.795
Why?

48:48.969 --> 48:50.449
[sighs]:
I don't know.

48:50.623 --> 48:53.191
Polly, you got something.

48:53.365 --> 48:54.757
POLLY:
Yeah.

48:54.932 --> 48:57.499
I was checking on the status
of our hack.

48:57.673 --> 48:59.762
And?

48:59.937 --> 49:01.677
The voting machines are gone.

49:01.851 --> 49:03.853
They've been decommissioned.ALL:
What?

49:04.028 --> 49:05.594
Look, all I know is the
Election Assistance Committee

49:05.768 --> 49:06.769
took them off-line today.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.336
[groans]Why?

49:08.510 --> 49:10.338
They're replacing
them with new ones.

49:10.512 --> 49:12.340
They found the hack.No. I don't know.

49:12.514 --> 49:14.734
Maybe it's even about
the Republican hack.

49:14.908 --> 49:17.606
So we're back to square one?

49:17.780 --> 49:19.826
[Diane laughs]

49:21.480 --> 49:22.785
Bye.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.352
Where are you going?

49:24.526 --> 49:25.614
Home.

49:25.788 --> 49:27.007
W-We've got
to figure this out.

49:27.181 --> 49:30.837
No. I have to go home.

49:32.752 --> 49:34.536
GARY:
We can still make the
reservation if we leave now.

49:34.710 --> 49:38.888
Uh, yeah, actually, Gary,
do you have a second to talk?

49:39.063 --> 49:40.934
Sure.

49:41.108 --> 49:43.023
What's wrong?[clears throat]

49:43.197 --> 49:45.243
Nothing. It's just, um...
[clears throat]

49:45.417 --> 49:48.376
I saw the interview you gave

49:48.550 --> 49:50.378
to Ted Willoughby.Oh, God, no, not that.

49:50.552 --> 49:51.901
Yeah, that.

49:52.076 --> 49:55.905
And look, Gary, I like you,
I really do.

49:56.080 --> 49:59.866
Uh, but, it's just, you know,
my life is-is complicated.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.956
No, I'm-I'm actually really glad
you saw that, because, uh,

50:03.130 --> 50:05.959
it opens the door
to a conversation.

50:06.133 --> 50:07.830
Oh, I don't think
we need one.I think we do.

50:08.005 --> 50:10.181
No, Gary...No, i-it'll only
take a minute. Please.

50:10.355 --> 50:13.053
Uh... Lucca.
[clearing throat]

50:13.227 --> 50:17.797
Have you ever taken
a personality test?

50:17.971 --> 50:20.669
Excuse me?

50:20.843 --> 50:23.498
A free
personality test.

50:23.672 --> 50:25.370
I know, I know, I-I thought
it sounded stupid, too,

50:25.544 --> 50:27.720
but, uh, it's actually
really opened my eyes

50:27.894 --> 50:29.548
to the reactive mind.
That's what I was talking about,

50:29.722 --> 50:32.159
coming to Chicago,
having my heart opened.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.943
But I thought you said
someone changed your life.

50:34.118 --> 50:36.468
Yes. The Commodore.

50:36.642 --> 50:38.905
