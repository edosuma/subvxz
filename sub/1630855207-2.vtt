WEBVTT

00:41.458 --> 00:43.209
Your landing...

00:43.209 --> 00:44.669
...needs work.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.213
That's my style.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.717
Come. Walk with me.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.218
Practice your English.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.517
W-Why are we here?

01:01.311 --> 01:03.855
I want to know
exactly what it is you're up to.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.566
I'm on a quest

01:07.067 --> 01:10.820
to try and stop Niu Mowang
and his uprising against the Jade Emperor.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.240
And naturally, this quest led you
to a high school on Earth?

01:14.240 --> 01:17.285
I know it seems crazy, but I had a dream.

01:17.786 --> 01:22.290
A crane appeared and told me a guide
will help me find the Fourth Scroll.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.001
All I have to do is take a leap of faith.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.879
You said you heard it from a crane?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.465
- Yes.
- As in, uh, Big Bird?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.092
Pretty big.

01:32.092 --> 01:37.180
And did this crane also tell you
to steal <i>jīn gū bàng</i>, your father's staff?

01:37.180 --> 01:38.973
Uh... no.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.392
That was my idea.

01:41.392 --> 01:43.186
I need it to unlock the scroll.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.021
Are you keeping it safe?

01:45.688 --> 01:46.689
Yeah.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.903
This is not to be taken lightly.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.324
The limit of its powers are unknown
and dark forces will be looking for it.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.700
Trust me.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.914
Mmm. Also, find a better hiding place.

02:02.914 --> 02:07.168
Why is it you and your father always
insist on hiding things in your ears?

02:09.087 --> 02:14.884
Guanyin-<i>púsà</i>, do you think
I'm making a mistake pursuing my dream?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.594
Do you?

02:16.594 --> 02:17.679
No. I don't.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.973
Then I support you.

02:19.973 --> 02:24.519
But I want you to know
it will be difficult and dangerous.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.563
Tell me more about this guide

02:26.563 --> 02:29.566
who will successfully lead you
to the Fourth Scroll.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.025
His name is <i>Wáng Jìn</i>.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.737
But he doesn't know he's my guide yet.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.323
And how do you know he's your guide?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
Just a feeling.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.413
Then you will have to find ways
to gain his trust.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.959
Not many mortals
will follow a monkey on a quest.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.211
How do I gain his trust?

02:50.795 --> 02:52.213
Try becoming his friend.

02:53.631 --> 02:57.844
And remember, the fate of your world
hangs in the balance.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.519
- Guanyin-<i>púsà</i>.
- Hmm?

03:06.519 --> 03:07.812
I'm ready to go back.

03:07.812 --> 03:09.022
Go back?

03:09.689 --> 03:11.441
We never left.

03:13.902 --> 03:17.488
I just needed to make sure
this is what you really wanted.

03:17.488 --> 03:18.740
What is this?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.450
Welcome to your new home.

03:21.075 --> 03:22.202
Ah.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.286
Yay.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.378
Oh, uh, sorry,
it's pizza boat day today actually.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.589
- A boat of pizza?
- No, it's...

03:34.589 --> 03:37.800
Actually, I'm not sure why they
call it that, 'cause it is just pizza.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.386
Okay. Go. Eat your boat.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.513
But tomorrow you eat my food, huh?

03:42.513 --> 03:43.598
Thanks, Mom.

03:44.682 --> 03:46.267
- Morning, Dad.
- Morning.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.437
Jin, about your soccer,
maybe you should try out again.

03:49.437 --> 03:52.982
- See if they will give you another chance.
- That's not really how it works, Mom.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.486
Well, you could at least say something
instead of just accept the decision.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.238
- Go talk to the boss.
- Coach.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.114
Yeah, I meant coach.

04:00.114 --> 04:03.117
If you don't speak up,
nothing's ever gonna change.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.416
Hey, Wei-Chen.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.919
- Hi, Jin.
- How are things?

04:13.419 --> 04:16.381
Yeah, good,
just getting used to my new apartment.

04:16.381 --> 04:19.717
Actually, I just found all those
<i>Kugo Ren</i> comics I told you about.

04:19.717 --> 04:20.802
No way, that's awesome.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.429
Um, actually, speaking of which...

04:24.389 --> 04:26.015
this is a really nice gift, but I just,

04:26.015 --> 04:28.851
I feel kind of weird taking it
'cause I know it's from your dad.

04:28.851 --> 04:31.145
Jin, you're my new friend.
I want you to have it.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.024
You should come over after school.
I can show you all the comics.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.656
Actually, um...

04:42.573 --> 04:44.909
I don't really have much time
for comics and stuff right now.

04:44.909 --> 04:47.412
It's just, I got
a lot of other stuff I gotta focus on.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.830
Oh, okay.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.833
Plus, you know,
last week was kind of rough.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.419
I just gotta make things right.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.962
But we should definitely hang.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.340
Thanks again and that thing's,
like, really cool

04:59.340 --> 05:01.342
with the secret compartment
and everything.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.927
- Catch you later.
- Bye.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.670
Hey.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.177
Is that the, uh, new <i>Swamp Thing</i>?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.595
I read it too.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.514
It's-- I wasn't, like, a super huge fan
of the character design.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.351
You're kidding, right?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.187
Before DC handed over the reins
to Mike Perkins,

05:54.187 --> 05:57.023
Swamp Thing looked like
the Grinch with a bad comb-over.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.776
- Yeah, I knew that would get you.
- Okay, screw you, dude.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.114
Okay, um, I'm really sorry.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.866
Mm-hmm.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.701
Didn't make it on to the team, huh?

06:08.701 --> 06:10.661
Screw you. Ow.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.748
No, no. I did not make it
on to the team, but...

06:15.625 --> 06:17.585
I-I just miss hanging out with you, dude.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.589
I miss talking comics,
having you disagree with all my opinions.

06:23.508 --> 06:25.927
Well, it's easy when you're wrong
about everything.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.393
How you holding up after last week?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.894
I'm fine.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.022
I feel like people are gonna, like,
get over this thing eventually, right?

06:38.022 --> 06:39.690
It depends on a couple of factors.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.109
So, like what?

06:41.109 --> 06:45.113
Apparently, Osito Valley vandalized
one of the hallways over the weekend,

06:45.113 --> 06:47.573
so people might be
talking about that today.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.117
I hope so.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.953
Also, some things just move quicker
through social media than others.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.455
For example, Baby Yoda's still trending.

06:54.455 --> 06:55.915
As he should.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.627
But nobody's talking about
Vin Diesel's dance song "Feel Like I Do."

06:59.627 --> 07:01.003
What?

07:01.003 --> 07:02.255
Exactly.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.092
Okay. Well, I hope I'm frigging Vin Diesel
and not Baby Yoda,

07:06.092 --> 07:08.845
'cause I'm gonna talk to the coach
and try to get him to, like--

07:09.470 --> 07:11.931
I wanna prove to him
that I deserve a spot on the team.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.892
Tell him I'm not gonna be a distraction...

07:14.892 --> 07:16.811
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:16.811 --> 07:18.563
- What do we want?
- Justice!

07:18.563 --> 07:21.232
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:21.232 --> 07:23.025
Yeah, you're Baby Yoda.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.735
Jin, so glad to see you.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.613
Please know that you have the full support
of the Culture Club.

07:27.613 --> 07:31.534
As president, I can assure you we will not
stop until we find out who did this.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.077
Uh, no, that's not necessary.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.079
- What do we want?
- Justice!

07:35.079 --> 07:37.248
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:37.248 --> 07:39.834
This is crazy, right?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.753
Crazy beautiful.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.297
- What do we want?
- Justice!

07:44.297 --> 07:46.466
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:46.466 --> 07:47.884
- What do we want?
- Justice!

07:47.884 --> 07:49.844
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:49.844 --> 07:51.304
- What do we want?
- Justice!

07:51.304 --> 07:53.139
- Who does it start with?
- Just us!

07:56.767 --> 07:58.060
Psst. Yo, Simon.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.437
- Oh, morning, Patrick.
- Yeah.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.147
Why are we whispering?

08:01.981 --> 08:04.692
I don't know, actually.
Just-- Just having fun at work.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.196
So, listen, uh, the boss is
in the break room doing small talk.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.489
We should go.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.200
I have work to do.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.451
Come on, man.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.204
Come on. You said you wanted
more face time with him, right?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.455
Now's your chance.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.416
Plus, you gotta get in there
before Bozo McDingdong does.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.668
- Okay.
- Yeah.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.128
Who's Bozo McDingdong?

08:24.128 --> 08:26.756
Oh, yeah.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.218
I mean, hey, if you're talking meat, boss,
I'm your guy.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.761
Okay, let's hear it.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.263
Two words. Reverse sear.

08:34.263 --> 08:37.099
Slow and low for six minutes,
then blast it for three.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.353
- Bob's your uncle.
- Wow. Maybe I should just hire you.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.315
Anyone watching NFL football?

08:45.483 --> 08:46.484
What?

08:46.484 --> 08:49.028
I am, Simon. I saw the Niners game.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.112
How's your fantasy?

08:52.281 --> 08:55.409
Fantasy football.
He's talking about fantasy football.

08:55.409 --> 08:58.246
Oh, right. It's...

08:58.246 --> 09:01.666
I'm in first place.
Won it last year too.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.336
- Took home 12 hundo. No big deal.
- Wow. That is a big deal.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.463
I'm actually in two leagues this year.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.300
Maybe you can give me some pointers.
My QB might be out for this season.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.302
Okay, don't even worry about that.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.179
Popular players don't always perform.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.890
That's the thing. People like scooping up
the QBs in the beginning...

09:19.225 --> 09:22.103
- Hey, Jin, can I have a word?
- Hey, Suzy, uh, sure. What's up?

09:22.103 --> 09:24.897
So, people are really rallying
around this meme incident.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.148
We're starting a movement.

09:26.148 --> 09:28.609
I even have an in with the editor
of the school paper.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.736
Aren't you the editor of the school paper?

09:30.736 --> 09:33.239
Yes, but I like to go
through the proper channels.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.158
I realized what we truly need
is a statement from you.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.744
Uh... A statement from me?

09:39.328 --> 09:42.248
Look, this is an important issue
to the Culture Club.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.418
But we can't do anything
unless you lead the way.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.549
Uh, I'm sorry, Suzy, I can't.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.761
Hi, Suzy.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.555
It's Wei-Chen from school.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.892
Hey, Jin. How have you been?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.728
Hey, I... Good. What's up?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.104
Not much.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.315
- Did you do anything this weekend?
- Uh, yeah.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.525
Um-- Oh, my dad was gonna teach me
how to drive,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.235
but then he was busy, so he didn't.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.988
So, no, actually.
I'm not sure why I-I said yes.

10:14.572 --> 10:18.951
Well, I, um... I just wanted to apologize.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.036
For what?

10:20.036 --> 10:23.956
Well, you-- you sort of asked to hang out,
and I felt kind of bad.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.959
Like maybe our conversation
distracted you and...

10:26.959 --> 10:28.794
No! No, no. It's fine.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.296
It's fine, and I'm fine,

10:30.296 --> 10:34.133
and I-I don't want you to feel bad
about anything ever.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.720
She totally does, though.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.182
By the way, we think
whoever posted that meme is so messed up.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.684
Also, BTS is, like, my favorite band
in the whole world.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.978
- Ruby. [whispers] Stop.
- What? It's true.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.731
Thank you. Um-- But, guys, it's fine.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.484
I think this whole thing's just gonna
blow over any minute. Right?

10:51.484 --> 10:52.943
Attention, everyone.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.321
Culture Club would like to make
an announcement.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.908
Representation.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.243
"Represent-Asian."

11:01.243 --> 11:05.373
I don't speak for my race.
I speak for my face.

11:05.373 --> 11:09.043
I didn't ask to be Japanese,
but look at me, please.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.545
Time to spare? Time to speak!

11:12.463 --> 11:15.466
Silence is complicity,
shaking my head weak!

11:16.258 --> 11:18.427
Now, I'd like to bring up someone
to make a comment

11:18.427 --> 11:20.971
about the recent online attack.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.056
Wei-Chen Sun!

11:25.851 --> 11:28.688
Fellow students, I'm Wei-Chen.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.817
Today I want to speak to you
about my friend, Jin Wang.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.820
He's a smart and a special boy.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.824
Also, he has good humor
and athletic body for sports.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.535
Like Jin, I am Chinese.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.913
So, an attack on him is an attack on me.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.457
That's why I fight for him.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.335
Now is the time for justice.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.463
And justice starts with just us.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.966
Just us. Just us. Just us.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.092
One more thing.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.886
Not only is Wei-Chen defending his friend,

12:00.886 --> 12:03.180
he has also helped us
identify the perpetrator.

12:03.180 --> 12:04.557
- See for yourselves.
- Oh, God.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.142
Pause the video at six seconds

12:06.142 --> 12:08.769
and zoom in
on the reflection in the trophy case.

12:08.769 --> 12:10.062
It is clear as day.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.939
It's Greg Wallace!

12:11.939 --> 12:13.023
It's Greg!

12:13.023 --> 12:15.192
Just us. Just us. Just us...

12:15.192 --> 12:17.987
This is bullying. It's an attack.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.239
Greg must answer for this.

12:20.239 --> 12:24.326
Just us. Just us. Just us. Just us.

12:43.804 --> 12:44.847
Simon.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.183
Simon!

12:56.108 --> 12:57.359
Uh.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.280
John, hi.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.492
Uh, I normally park over there.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.203
This something you do often?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.955
Uh, I n-- usually work through lunch,

13:09.955 --> 13:12.166
but today I have to do something.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.169
Listening to Bon Jovi at full blast?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.088
Yeah.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.133
Here, I wanna show you something.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.515
I'm sorry for the disturbance, John.

13:29.141 --> 13:31.769
I just found this in an old box of photos.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.942
You look good.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.652
Thank you. I think so too.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.403
My wife begs to differ.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.490
This was the Slippery Tour, '87.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.158
- Wow.
- Ah.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.577
I went three nights in a row.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.081
Three times.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.165
Ooh.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.252
Jeff Beck's solo. Turn it up.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.212
Um, okay.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.472
Uh, hey, Jin.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.182
Hey, Greg.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.977
- Where to?
- Uh, just PE.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.061
Cool.

14:15.145 --> 14:18.399
Look, I just-- I wanna let you know,
you're a good guy.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.109
Thanks.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.986
Yeah, and you know
I'm a good guy too, right?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.571
Yeah, for sure.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.782
It just-- Uh, hey, it really sucks
you didn't make JV this year.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.828
Oh, yeah, uh...
You know, it is what it is, right?

14:30.828 --> 14:34.248
I mean, actually,
I'm pretty close with Coach G,

14:34.248 --> 14:35.583
being team captain and all.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.543
If you want, I could talk to him for you.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.253
Wait, seriously? Would you do that?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.964
Yeah, why not?
Like I said, you're a good guy.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.008
Yeah. Well, that'd be awesome.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.176
- Consider it done.
- Thanks.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.637
- Oh, hey, by the way, um...
- What's up?

14:48.637 --> 14:51.807
Principal Kinney,
she thinks the whole meme thing,

14:51.807 --> 14:54.977
it-it violates the school's
anti-bullying code.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.272
Yeah, I might miss a few games
this season. Can you believe that?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.524
Yeah, uh-- Yeah, that sucks, man.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.484
Yeah. Honestly, I just--

15:02.484 --> 15:05.529
I only did it
to make the other varsity guys laugh.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.116
You should hear
the kind of stuff they say.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.493
It's way worse.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.204
Hey, you know,
I just thought of something.

15:14.204 --> 15:17.833
Since I'm gonna talk to Coach G for you,
what if you talk to the principal for me?

15:18.918 --> 15:22.296
You could just let her know that
we're friends and, uh, I'm a good guy.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.966
All right?

15:26.467 --> 15:27.801
Listen, uh,

15:27.801 --> 15:29.720
- I should probably get to class.
- Yeah.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.306
I don't wanna be late.
So, talk to you later?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.224
Yeah, sure. See you, Jin.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.435
Come in.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.479
Hey, uh, Coach G, do you have a minute?

15:38.479 --> 15:41.523
I heard about the raccoon
in the storage unit. I'm on it.

15:41.523 --> 15:44.485
Uh, no, it's about
the soccer team, actually.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.571
Oh.

15:48.489 --> 15:49.823
Jin, hey, come on in.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.284
Um...

15:53.410 --> 15:56.622
I wanted to apologize
about what happened at tryouts last week.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.667
You mean when you tackled Travis?

15:59.667 --> 16:00.876
Right, yeah, that.

16:00.876 --> 16:05.255
Uh, I think I just wanted it so much
that I kind of lost my cool.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.387
Jin, I'm the coach of the soccer team.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.515
But do you know
who the real coach in life is?

16:16.642 --> 16:18.060
Are you gonna say Jesus?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.062
No. I was gonna say, "our mistakes."

16:20.062 --> 16:21.438
Yeah, right, sorry.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.566
Look, I know you're going through
a tough time right now.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.403
I saw that whole protest thing out there,
and I do feel for you.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.487
My only question is,

16:28.487 --> 16:32.241
can you take that frustration
and turn it into motivation?

16:33.158 --> 16:35.828
Yes. Yes, Coach. Yes, I can. Uh, 100%.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.830
Whatever you need, I can carry the weight.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.667
It's funny you mention weight.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.294
I asked the school board
for a new equipment room,

16:44.294 --> 16:45.879
and I think they misunderstood me.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.425
Because they gave me a new room but
didn't actually buy any new equipment.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.552
You think you can help me
set things up in here?

16:51.552 --> 16:53.971
Yeah. Yes, sir.
Coach, I'll get started right away.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.682
So, what I'm gonna d--
I'm gonna start with the lighter ones

16:56.682 --> 16:58.976
and move my way up to the heavier ones,
and that's my plan.

16:58.976 --> 17:02.479
Great. And if you're motivated enough
to get things done by this afternoon,

17:02.479 --> 17:04.898
maybe we can chat
about the last spot on the team.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.111
Go Cranes.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.920
Pigsy?

17:26.920 --> 17:30.507
He must be here for the Staff.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.222
Favorite album.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.348
<i>Blaze of Glory</i>.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.017
<i>New Jersey</i>.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.227
- Favorite song.
-"Lay Your Hands On Me."

17:42.227 --> 17:43.437
"Santa Fe."

17:44.688 --> 17:46.190
Interesting.

17:46.190 --> 17:49.943
When I was younger,
my friend had a bootleg CD.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.199
That song sounded like America.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.202
How many times have you seen them live?

18:01.246 --> 18:02.706
Simon. Really?

18:03.874 --> 18:06.210
It wasn't so easy where I'm from.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.879
But it's okay. I have my car.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.424
What a shame.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.718
The shows back then were really something.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.179
Young. Alive.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.014
You felt like a god.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.017
Young enough to dream big.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.228
That's right.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.899
Speaking of dreaming big...

18:29.900 --> 18:32.236
As you know, I've been
with this company for ten years--

18:32.236 --> 18:36.907
Before I forget, you have to hear
this cover band I found online.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.284
They're called You Give Love A Band Name.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.702
They're genius.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.204
Yeah, uh, great.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.207
Um, but I've been wanting
to ask you, John--

18:45.207 --> 18:49.670
I'm glad we made this connection, Simon,
before it was too late.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.171
Too late?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.923
I mean, before I'm not around anymore.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.051
You know that I'm retiring
next month, right?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.762
- No, I did not.
- Yep.

18:58.762 --> 19:01.640
Have to admit,
I'm pretty excited about it.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.726
Congratulations.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.145
Thank you.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.117
Jin! Jin! Um, hi.
Uh, I've been looking for you.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.327
Look, if you haven't noticed,
I'm a little busy here.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.037
Yeah, okay,
but I just want you to have this.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.373
What? No, dude, I already told you.
I don't want that.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.584
Jin. Just take it. It's important to me.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.211
- Why are you so upset at me?
- I don't know, dude.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.630
Maybe I'm not into being called out
in front of the entire school.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.715
I don't understand.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.384
The people in Culture Club said
you would like it if I spoke up for you.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.720
Yeah, of course they did,
because they're using you, dude.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.889
Everyone else is laughing at you.
So, if you don't mind,

19:41.889 --> 19:44.308
- I gotta move some weights.
- Jin, let me help you.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.476
No, dude, I think you've helped enough--

19:46.476 --> 19:48.520
H-How are you doing that?

20:07.247 --> 20:09.166
Seriously?

20:33.732 --> 20:35.651
Did you talk to your coach today?

20:36.401 --> 20:37.402
Yeah.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.950
You'll do another tryout next year.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.120
Yeah, I just...

20:47.120 --> 20:49.373
...just thought this year
was gonna be different.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.791
That's all.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.877
You used your voice, Jin.
That's all that matters.

20:54.878 --> 20:58.298
It's how you get what you want.
It's where your power is.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.469
Next year, huh?

21:11.812 --> 21:14.106
I'm ready to make my statement.
That was loud, sorry.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.649
When do you wanna say something?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.359
How about right now?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.528
Clear the table.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.990
Excuse me, everyone.
I'd like to make an announcement.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.535
I'd like to make a statement!

21:29.037 --> 21:30.622
So, uh...

21:31.123 --> 21:33.458
You guys probably already know me, right?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.711
There was that video of me
going around last week,

21:35.711 --> 21:38.797
with me and the meme
from that old TV show <i>Beyond Repair</i>.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.758
I know a lot of people felt
like it was offensive, so...

21:42.718 --> 21:45.095
Wanted to kinda address that.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.180
I don't wanna tell anyone else
how to feel,

21:47.180 --> 21:50.392
but, personally,
I thought it was just a harmless joke.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.935
What the hell is he doing?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.646
- Trying to be Vin Diesel's dance track.
- It didn't really bother me at all...

21:54.646 --> 21:56.106
- What?
- Exactly.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.232
...how to feel.

21:57.232 --> 22:01.028
But I think that we should all
just move on to more important things

22:01.028 --> 22:04.448
like saving the polar bears or
why we only get pizza boat twice a month.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.575
- Together we can overcome.
- Yeah!

22:09.411 --> 22:11.538
Oh, and, uh, one more thing.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.748
Um...

22:14.291 --> 22:16.460
Greg Wallace is a good guy.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.919
He's a friend of mine,

22:17.919 --> 22:22.841
and-- and I honestly don't believe
he was trying to offend anybody, so...

22:25.052 --> 22:27.304
Yeah, that's it. That's all.
Thanks for listening.

22:27.304 --> 22:31.183
Um, go back to your protein shakes
or whatever you kids...

22:32.642 --> 22:34.895
Okay. Uh, excuse me,
I'm gonna just hop down.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.369
- Home early?
- Mmm.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.464
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.846
Guess what happened yesterday at work.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.348
I'd rather not.

23:13.266 --> 23:15.310
I found out my boss, John...

23:17.312 --> 23:19.272
he loves Bon Jovi.

23:20.023 --> 23:21.233
Okay.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.360
All these years...

23:24.486 --> 23:26.655
I finally connected. We talked for hours.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.784
And what about your promotion?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.456
He can't do anything.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.333
He's retiring in a month.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.585
It's too late.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.800
You really don't see it, do you?

23:47.592 --> 23:49.094
See what?

23:49.594 --> 23:51.930
You can be so dumb.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.892
John retiring means
there's a position opening up.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.811
This is what you've been waiting for.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.188
How can you not see it?

24:01.815 --> 24:02.858
Me?

24:04.067 --> 24:05.819
Run the division?

24:05.819 --> 24:06.820
Why not?

24:08.655 --> 24:09.906
I've never even considered that.

24:09.906 --> 24:11.199
Yes, you have.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.952
You just never believed it was possible.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.163
Okay. I'll say it for you.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.664
"I can be the boss.

24:18.206 --> 24:19.624
I'm experienced and qualified.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.001
I can do this."

24:21.001 --> 24:23.086
Hmm?

24:28.842 --> 24:29.843
What's for dinner?

24:29.843 --> 24:30.844
Let me help you.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.435
Hey, uh, Coach.
You wanted to see me?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.187
Uh, look, let me call you back.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.606
Hey, Jin.

24:43.690 --> 24:47.444
So, it turns out the fire extinguisher
was hung in the wrong place,

24:47.444 --> 24:51.448
which the insurance company says
is the district's fault and not ours.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.074
In other words, you lucked out.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.576
But, also, thank you,

24:54.576 --> 24:56.703
because now they have to build me
a new equipment room.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.499
That's amazing. Oh, do you want me
to help set it up? 'Cause I can--

25:00.499 --> 25:02.584
No, no. It's okay. I'll do it myself.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.212
The real reason I wanted to talk to you

25:05.212 --> 25:08.089
is to tell you I appreciated you
coming to me to ask for another shot.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.257
Showed guts.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.550
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.554
Also, one of my varsity captains said
you showed a lot of promise at tryouts.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.264
He seems to really believe in you.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.980
Tomorrow, 3:30. Don't be late.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.608
Yes, sir. You got it.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.867
How's it feel?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.286
What?

25:38.286 --> 25:41.456
To take your whole community
three steps backwards.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.042
Suzy, I did everything you asked, right?

25:44.042 --> 25:47.045
I made my statement,
so what more do you want?

25:47.045 --> 25:50.048
You sure that was a statement?
Or was it a soccer tryout?

25:50.757 --> 25:52.968
Look, Suzy,

25:53.510 --> 25:56.972
I know I'm not the brave, heroic
spokesperson that you want me to be,

25:57.556 --> 26:00.433
but honestly, I just wanna be
a regular guy who does regular things

26:00.433 --> 26:03.228
like hang out with my friends
and play soccer.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.772
Look, it's hard to speak up, Jin.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.482
I know that.

26:07.482 --> 26:08.942
But...

26:08.942 --> 26:12.487
...there are a lot of people out there
who don't have a voice,

26:12.487 --> 26:15.407
so it's up to people like us
to speak for them.

26:16.658 --> 26:21.162
I disagree with your decision today,
but I respect your honesty.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.626
And, by the way,
why would you wanna be a regular guy?

26:33.174 --> 26:34.926
Pigsy.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.013
You little thief.

26:39.222 --> 26:40.724
Someone needs to teach you a lesson.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.896
Look! French fries!

26:55.530 --> 26:57.449
You gotta be kidding me.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.546
Hmm.

27:19.804 --> 27:21.431
Wei-Chen?

27:50.627 --> 27:52.545
You win! You win!

27:58.051 --> 27:59.969
Wei-Chen? What the hell?

28:03.973 --> 28:05.600
If my father couldn't stop me,

28:05.600 --> 28:06.601
you won't either.

28:08.269 --> 28:12.232
I'll come home when my quest is complete.

28:15.443 --> 28:16.444
Jin!
