I'm getting used to it.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.395
So who's here
supporting you tonight?

13:15.395 --> 13:19.298
Oh, my God.
My lovely mother and father.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.502
[cheers and applause]

13:22.502 --> 13:25.638
Hello, Mama and Papa Angeria.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.575
Now, did you always know
you were raising a star?

13:29.575 --> 13:31.744
Well, yes, I really did.

13:31.744 --> 13:34.681
Because I can remember, you
know, her as a kindergartner.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.516
She won her first crown.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.384
And then from one through 12
after that,

13:38.384 --> 13:40.620
every year
she had a crown on her head.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.456
She got a crown
from kindergarten?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.391
Oh, yes, yes.

13:45.391 --> 13:47.060
Yes, she really did.

13:47.060 --> 13:48.661
For doing what?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.764
She was queen--
she was king of kindergarten.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.435
-The queen/king of kindergarten.
-Kindergarten, yes.

13:55.435 --> 13:56.836
Okay.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.705
Yes.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.141
Well, Angeria
turned out so great.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.310
Do you have advice
for other parents

14:04.310 --> 14:08.748
who may be raising a king
or queen of kindergarten?

14:08.748 --> 14:13.553
Well, I would say just love
your kids for who they are

14:13.553 --> 14:15.121
and always, you know,
stand by them

14:15.121 --> 14:17.657
for whatever they wanna be,
and, you know,

14:17.657 --> 14:20.159
just support them
and love them.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.694
Yeah, I love that.
I love that.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.697
Now, Angeria, I've always said
drag doesn't change who you are.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.632
It reveals who you are.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.870
So what have you learned
about yourself through drag?

14:30.870 --> 14:33.306
The one thing that I can
definitely say that I learned

14:33.306 --> 14:36.776
is honestly something
that my mom has been telling me

14:36.776 --> 14:38.010
since I was
about four years old,

14:38.010 --> 14:42.315
and that's I can do anything
I put my mind to.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.584
-I love that.
-Yes.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.253
Yes. Yes.
[cheers and applause]

14:47.253 --> 14:49.922

to being a drag queen,

16:03.129 --> 16:04.864
I would say
my journey on Drag Race

16:04.864 --> 16:07.466
was kind of like this.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.035
We started out pretty strong,

16:09.035 --> 16:10.937
then we shit the bed a little
bit.

16:10.937 --> 16:14.707
I'm known for being
an outfit repeater,

16:14.707 --> 16:18.377
which to the gays
is a cardinal sin. [laughs]

16:18.377 --> 16:22.415
I almost got the chop,
but the drag gods saved me.

16:22.415 --> 16:25.351
I came back and won through
the power of shit-talking.

16:29.121 --> 16:32.358
I have no qualms
about being competitive,

16:32.358 --> 16:35.061
but going through
the competition has taught me

16:35.061 --> 16:37.196
how to roll with the punches

16:37.196 --> 16:40.399
and pull yourself back together

18:52.565 --> 18:56.769

but where I was

18:58.704 --> 19:00.006
for a very long time.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.108
So I kind of started
bringing that

19:02.108 --> 19:03.743
and started dressing up as that.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.478
Always loved villains

I went into this

19:47.153 --> 19:49.321

a lot of friends.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.323
That wasn't my priority,
by any means.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.260
But I've walked away with,
like, not only friends,

19:54.260 --> 19:56.262
but, like, a sisterhood.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.397

in Montana been watching?

20:05.337 --> 20:07.039
This is the first time
they've ever seen me in drag

20:07.039 --> 20:09.008
was for, um, the show,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.811
and I've had some family members
come to some of my shows now,

every angle of my taint.

your relationship

Uh...

20:41.707 --> 20:44.376
it's never boring.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.745

Very well done.

And Lucy, is it true that
you made some of Bosco's looks?

20:55.554 --> 20:57.289
I made some pieces
here or there.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.191
I let her borrow
some things, yeah.

20:59.191 --> 21:03.162

bras, corsets, and panties?

21:04.330 --> 21:06.832

take credit for those,

21:06.832 --> 21:08.901
but, you know, in Seattle,

21:08.901 --> 21:11.270
we support and celebrate
all types of drag,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.372

we really love to celebrate

if they don't like it,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.448
wear less and charge more.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.682

21:23.682 --> 21:25.784

21:27.620 --> 21:30.222
What do you love the most
about drag?

21:30.222 --> 21:32.758
So drag--oh, sorry.

is slappin' right now.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.961

21:35.961 --> 21:39.465
Yeah, drag taught me
who I wanted to be

21:39.465 --> 21:41.100
and, like, taught me
how I want it to be.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.301
I love that.

Wow, Daya Betty.

25:11.443 --> 25:15.214
Well, Daya Betty, you ain't
a fighter, you're a lover.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.448
Oh, thank you.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.550
Now, Daya,
you were sent packing

25:18.550 --> 25:20.352
after your very first episode,

25:20.352 --> 25:23.722
but you earned your way
to this grand finale.

25:23.722 --> 25:26.258
Where does your determination
come from?

25:26.258 --> 25:27.626
Oh, my gosh.
Well, I mean,

25:27.626 --> 25:30.863
I was just, like, raised
in a household of people

25:30.863 --> 25:33.365
that were super strong-willed
and outspoken,

25:33.365 --> 25:35.267
and all of my families are.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.170
Maybe it's just something in
the water in Missouri, you know?

25:38.170 --> 25:42.574
Like, cigarette butts,
dead bugs, and determination.

25:42.574 --> 25:43.776
[all laugh]

25:43.776 --> 25:45.277
Now, this season

25:45.277 --> 25:47.112
you were compared
to your sister Crystal Methyd.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.213
Yes.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.415
Did she have any advice for you?

25:49.415 --> 25:51.016
Well, she told me
to grow a mullet,

25:51.016 --> 25:55.921
but that's not really
possible for me, so...

25:55.921 --> 25:57.990
And if you were
a member of DeBarge,

25:57.990 --> 25:59.591
which member would you be?

25:59.591 --> 26:01.894
[all laugh]

26:01.894 --> 26:03.762
Who's DeBarge?

26:03.762 --> 26:06.365
-[all laugh]
-What?

26:06.365 --> 26:08.534
And what inspired you
to do drag?

26:08.534 --> 26:11.136
Well, I get a lot of
inspiration from, like,

26:11.136 --> 26:15.808
women that don't necessarily
follow the
social norms.

26:15.808 --> 26:19.411
You know, like, I like
that rough around the edges

26:19.411 --> 26:20.913
kind of aesthetic.

26:20.913 --> 26:24.082
And, you know, I'm bald,
so I like putting on a wig

26:24.082 --> 26:25.851
and pretending I have hair
for once.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.453
[laughter]

26:27.453 --> 26:29.655
So who's here
supporting you tonight?

26:29.655 --> 26:32.791
Yeah, I have
my boyfriend Tanner.

26:32.791 --> 26:34.626
-Yay, Tanner!
-Yes, Tanner.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.295
And then my--

26:36.295 --> 26:39.398
the other House of Methyd
member, Lux.

26:39.398 --> 26:42.267
-Oh, wow.
-Yes, yes.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.837
Tanner, what makes you
the most proud of Daya Betty?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.939
I would say
what makes me most proud

26:46.939 --> 26:50.075
is how she's not afraid
to express her emotions

26:50.075 --> 26:51.109
and deal with them.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.212
And as you can tell,

26:53.212 --> 26:54.847
she puts her heart
into everything she does,

26:54.847 --> 26:56.982
and she does it flawlessly.

26:56.982 --> 26:59.184
-Yes, she does.
-Love you.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.487
All right,
final question, Daya.

27:01.487 --> 27:04.490
What's the most important thing
you'll be taking away

27:04.490 --> 27:06.291
from your time at Drag Race?

27:06.291 --> 27:09.194
I just think it's really
important to remember, like,

27:09.194 --> 27:12.064
life is gonna
throw you curveballs,

27:12.064 --> 27:13.866
things are gonna get you down,

27:13.866 --> 27:16.168
things are not gonna go
as you planned.

27:16.168 --> 27:18.604
But what matters
is how you get up from that

27:18.604 --> 27:20.272
and how you stand tall

27:20.272 --> 27:23.475
and you keep fighting
through it.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.245
I love that.
[cheers and applause]

27:26.245 --> 27:29.181
Now, Daya Betty, I say this
as a compliment.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.817
There ain't nothin' safe
about you.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.486
Give it up for the dangerous
and delightful Daya Betty!

of RuPaul's Drag Race
from Las Vegas.

27:56.308 --> 27:59.545
Tonight's showgirl
showdown continues

27:59.545 --> 28:01.680
as I determine
which two queens

28:01.680 --> 28:03.448
will lip sync for the crown.

28:03.448 --> 28:07.653
Up next, she's a queen with
a mix of sugar and spice, girl.

It's Lady Camden!

because luck be a lady tonight,

28:16.061 --> 28:18.063
even though
we all know at this point

28:18.063 --> 28:19.631
she don't need no luck.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.934
Viva Las Vegas, baby!

28:21.934 --> 28:24.503
We love you, Lady Camden!

28:24.503 --> 28:28.040
I'm really proud that
I feel like a rock star now,

28:28.040 --> 28:32.611
after entering the competition
a kind of timid little mouse.

28:32.611 --> 28:35.080
I think the queens
and the judges

28:35.080 --> 28:36.448
were sleeping on me.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.317
I hope she kicks
Daya Betty's ass.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.851
[all laugh]

28:39.851 --> 28:41.086
I just might.

28:41.086 --> 28:43.088
And while it feels like maybe

28:43.088 --> 28:44.923
it was harder for me
to prove myself,

28:44.923 --> 28:47.593
the end result
is a much sweeter taste.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.161
[audience laughs]

28:49.161 --> 28:51.029
When I felt close to a win
and didn't get it,

28:51.029 --> 28:52.664
that kind of
shifted things for me.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.066
It made me feel like,

28:54.066 --> 28:56.902
oh, I need to kind of scream
and shout a little bit more.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.871
Maxine!

28:59.871 --> 29:01.373
People are waiting
for you to succeed.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.508
Some people want you to,
you know, trip and fall.

29:04.810 --> 29:08.513
But a lot of people love it
when you stand back up

29:08.513 --> 29:10.616
and win the challenge.
[cheering]

29:10.616 --> 29:12.217

29:12.217 --> 29:16.688
My highs in this competition

29:16.688 --> 29:22.260
have steadily just been, like,
boom, pow, wow, psh, pew.

29:22.260 --> 29:25.464
I feel like I've slammed
the door open to who I am now.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.367
My family is American
as well as British,

29:28.367 --> 29:30.636
and my American side
of the family,

29:30.636 --> 29:32.738
they just don't
give a fuck as much.

29:32.738 --> 29:34.306
And I think
that's the side of me

29:34.306 --> 29:36.742
that I'm continuing
to embrace more and more.

29:36.742 --> 29:39.077

is an embodiment

29:45.450 --> 29:48.553
of who Max wanted to be
when he was six years old.

29:48.553 --> 29:52.290
It just feels like
I'm giving back

29:52.290 --> 29:55.027
to that little kid
who was so scared

29:55.027 --> 30:00.899
to just, like, be gay
and be feminine and be fierce.

30:00.899 --> 30:02.134

once a theater kid,

31:50.442 --> 31:52.244
always a theater kid.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.512
Yes.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.480
I used to pull stunts
all the time.

31:55.480 --> 31:56.548
I used to run away from home,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.683
pretend I'd,
you know, left forever.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.952
I would pretend
that I was really upset

32:00.952 --> 32:02.287
when people would say
mean things to me,

32:02.287 --> 32:03.622
and then I'd just be like,
"Just kidding."

32:03.622 --> 32:05.590
[RuPaul laughs]

32:05.590 --> 32:09.161
Now, your Freddie Mercury reveal
was epic.

Now, I understand--
yes, it was.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.998

32:12.998 --> 32:16.101
I understand the group Queen
has a special meaning for you.

32:16.101 --> 32:18.770
Yeah, when I was deciding
to quit all of my jobs,

32:18.770 --> 32:21.940
full-time dancing, waiting
as a server at a restaurant,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.309
the day that I left,
I put on my music

32:24.309 --> 32:27.712
and the first song that came on
was Break Free by Queen.

32:27.712 --> 32:30.115
I don't know. It was just
kind of, like, a nice sign.

32:30.115 --> 32:33.051
It felt like something good
was on the horizon.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.319
Now, looking back,

32:34.319 --> 32:36.354
is there anything you'd
do differently this season?

32:36.354 --> 32:39.791
I think I would take your advice
from day one,

32:39.791 --> 32:43.595
which was just to kind of
let go and truly be yourself.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.231
I feel like--it's what I've
learned from this competition

32:46.231 --> 32:48.099
is it's one thing
to be successful,

32:48.099 --> 32:50.135
but it's everything
to be yourself.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.536
Yes, yes.

Can you tell
which one's the real mama?

33:05.050 --> 33:06.218
Well, let me guess.

33:06.218 --> 33:09.087
Let me guess which one
is your drag mother

33:09.087 --> 33:13.491
and which one
is your birth mother.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.693
-Hmm.
-They look the same.

33:14.693 --> 33:15.861
They do.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.462
-Twins.
-They do look the same.

33:17.462 --> 33:21.533
So Mother Camden, did you travel
all the way from England?

33:21.533 --> 33:22.834
Yes, I did.

was a stunt queen?

33:36.348 --> 33:38.049
Mm-hmm.

33:38.049 --> 33:40.151
How early did you know that?

33:40.151 --> 33:42.988
Well...five.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.489
-Five years old? What happened?
-Yeah.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.625
He was running around
in my stilettos,

33:46.625 --> 33:48.360
swinging in the garden.

you wanna say to Lady Camden?

34:03.642 --> 34:06.511
You possess
the super power of drag.

34:06.511 --> 34:09.948
Will you use it
for good or evil?

34:09.948 --> 34:13.818
Um, I would say both, because
Freddie Mercury made me vers.

of RuPaul's Drag Race
from Las Vegas.

34:53.692 --> 34:57.696
Now, we are down to our
final showdown performance.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.030
Since day one,

34:59.030 --> 35:03.268
this next queen has proven
that weird is wonderful.

Willow Pill. Take a look.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.813
Tonight, I feel like a high
roller on top of the world,

35:14.813 --> 35:17.849
and nothing and nobody
can stop me.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.118
When I first
walked in the werkroom,

35:20.118 --> 35:21.419
the queens underestimated me.

35:21.419 --> 35:24.990
But over time, I think
their opinions flip-flopped.

35:24.990 --> 35:27.926
I think I brought something
different every time.

35:27.926 --> 35:31.262
I'm more of a character
than I thought I was,

35:31.262 --> 35:32.564
and I always have
a little smile on my face,

35:32.564 --> 35:35.200
but I'm usually scheming
behind in the brain.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.770
I think what I've done
on the show

35:38.770 --> 35:41.072
has resonated with people
so much

35:41.072 --> 35:44.609
because what I do is just
take dark and painful moments

35:44.609 --> 35:46.111
and take the piss out of it.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.780
I am here to represent people

35:48.780 --> 35:51.383
who are dealing
with disabilities

35:51.383 --> 35:53.318
and physical illness.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.519
It is a big part of my drag.

35:54.519 --> 35:57.322
I've been through
a shit storm and back,

35:57.322 --> 36:01.426
and it's made my drag funnier
and more interesting.

36:04.029 --> 36:07.298
It's just a special sauce
that I bring to my drag,

36:07.298 --> 36:10.135
and it's more than just
mayonnaise and ketchup.

36:10.135 --> 36:13.138
I've been so consistently
in the top.

36:13.138 --> 36:14.906
Lovely weather we're having.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.609
I've barely faltered
in this competition,

36:17.609 --> 36:19.477
and I think I deserve to win.

36:19.477 --> 36:23.782
Tonight, I'm feeling
a lot of emotions.

36:23.782 --> 36:27.819
This is my last little lap,
and I'm so excited for it.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.055
I can't wait
to share this piece of me.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.690
It's so true to who I am.

36:32.690 --> 36:37.395
I wanna give Las Vegas
the full Willow Pill experience.

36:37.395 --> 36:39.230
I wanna leave them
laughing, crying,

her charisma, uniqueness,
