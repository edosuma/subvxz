00:44.457 --> 00:51.097
NARRATOR: Once upon a time,
there was a great warrior.

00:51.163 --> 00:53.498
Though young in years,

00:53.564 --> 00:57.969
his was an old, powerful soul.

00:58.036 --> 01:04.143
And he was all that stood
between his people,

01:04.209 --> 01:06.011
and total destruction.

01:06.078 --> 01:09.814
The village enemies
come from far and wide,

01:09.881 --> 01:14.953
but they don't suspect
the white wolves have returned!

01:15.020 --> 01:18.456
[howls]

01:24.629 --> 01:28.100
[tribal shout]

01:32.204 --> 01:33.804
In olden days,

01:33.871 --> 01:37.042
the forest surrounding our village

01:37.109 --> 01:41.980
was inhabited by great white wolves.

01:58.930 --> 02:01.466
MOTHER: Why are you still awake?

02:01.532 --> 02:04.735
SAVVA: I'm watching the storm.

02:04.802 --> 02:07.939
Why did the white wolves attack man?

02:08.006 --> 02:10.441
MOTHER:
Savva, you know the story.

02:10.508 --> 02:13.744
I've told you a thousand times.

02:13.811 --> 02:17.249
SAVVA: But where did they go,
and why did they all disappear?

02:17.315 --> 02:18.816
MOTHER: No one knows.

02:18.883 --> 02:22.487
The wolves and humans had close ties.

02:22.553 --> 02:24.722
They were our protectors.

02:24.789 --> 02:26.924
Legend says that a great magician

02:26.992 --> 02:28.960
punished them for turning on us

02:29.027 --> 02:31.829
by changing them into horrid beasts,

02:31.896 --> 02:35.234
which they would remain until
the day a knight would come

02:35.300 --> 02:38.204
to save the world entire.

02:42.707 --> 02:44.809
Why do you say it like that?

02:44.875 --> 02:47.578
"Saving the world entire?"

02:47.645 --> 02:48.980
It sounds weird.

02:49.047 --> 02:52.051
The legends are often told in poetry.

02:52.118 --> 02:54.619
But can one knight really do that?

02:54.685 --> 02:56.521
Save the whole world?

02:56.587 --> 02:57.722
Of course he can.

02:57.788 --> 03:00.425
A person can do anything,

03:00.491 --> 03:02.593
but only if you truly wish for it

03:02.660 --> 03:05.064
with all of your heart.

03:05.131 --> 03:06.431
[distant barking]

03:06.497 --> 03:08.466
[barking continues]

03:08.533 --> 03:10.435
Mom, is something wrong?

03:10.501 --> 03:12.204
No. I just thought...

03:12.271 --> 03:15.241
[thunder]

03:15.306 --> 03:16.407
They're here.

03:16.474 --> 03:24.549
[tense music]

03:25.650 --> 03:27.485
Hurry. Down you go.

03:27.552 --> 03:28.919
I want to stay with you!

03:28.986 --> 03:31.556
Do as I say. Now, Savva!

03:47.206 --> 03:48.673
[gasps]

04:01.852 --> 04:06.125
All alone then, sweetie?

04:06.192 --> 04:09.295
Yes, I'm alone.

04:13.232 --> 04:16.934
Everyone is to gather
in the square. Now!

04:23.674 --> 04:26.043
[evil laughter]

04:26.112 --> 04:29.514
After we're done feeding
on your harvest,

04:29.580 --> 04:31.283
we're taking you to Mom!

04:33.384 --> 04:36.654
She'll pay handsomely for new slaves

04:36.721 --> 04:38.956
to toil through the winter.

04:39.023 --> 04:40.558
[laughs]

04:40.625 --> 04:41.892
Bring us the harvest!

04:41.959 --> 04:45.796
Make sure you haven't hidden any away!

04:45.863 --> 04:48.599
Or we'll eat you instead!
[laughs]

05:07.452 --> 05:10.222
[snoring]

05:15.593 --> 05:19.997
[snoring continues]

05:40.518 --> 05:43.354
Hey, where is my mom?

05:45.623 --> 05:47.892
Savva, what are you doing?

05:47.958 --> 05:51.562
I told you to stay hidden.

05:51.629 --> 05:54.432
I'm gonna get you out, Mom.

05:54.499 --> 05:57.535
Go back to the cellar. Please!

05:57.602 --> 06:00.871
This cage must have a weakness.

06:06.577 --> 06:08.413
Hmm...

06:08.479 --> 06:10.014
How could I break it?

06:12.683 --> 06:14.419
No!

06:14.485 --> 06:16.454
[snarling]

06:16.521 --> 06:18.689
I'll get you out, Mom.

06:22.893 --> 06:25.264
Get that boy!

06:29.567 --> 06:31.436
Get him.

06:39.077 --> 06:44.283
[intense music]

07:04.802 --> 07:07.305
[panting]

07:07.372 --> 07:08.373
[gasps]

07:13.611 --> 07:18.449
[sniffing]

07:21.586 --> 07:23.854
I can feel he's close.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.691
Where, where, where, where, where?

07:26.757 --> 07:28.326
There!

07:45.976 --> 07:47.245
[twig snaps]

07:50.715 --> 07:52.050
[screams]

07:54.419 --> 07:55.886
He's there!

08:01.726 --> 08:03.027
Oh, no.

08:43.501 --> 08:45.002
Get him, get him, get him, get him!

08:45.070 --> 08:47.105
No, no, no, no!

09:34.452 --> 09:36.320
[screams]

09:40.591 --> 09:43.661
This isn't happening.

09:43.728 --> 09:45.362
It's a dream.

09:51.301 --> 09:55.273
[horror music]

09:55.339 --> 09:57.341
Hello!

09:57.408 --> 10:01.345
[evil laughter]

10:07.885 --> 10:11.922
You have nowhere to run.

10:16.061 --> 10:18.996
Got you, little bug!

10:19.064 --> 10:20.330
Yeah!

10:20.397 --> 10:21.599
Got you!

10:21.666 --> 10:23.033
Get away from me!

10:23.101 --> 10:24.435
[evil laughter]

10:24.502 --> 10:27.605
[distant howling]

10:27.672 --> 10:28.873
[growling]

10:28.939 --> 10:30.908
Is that...

10:30.975 --> 10:33.644
That's not possible.

10:40.618 --> 10:42.987
[howling]

10:43.054 --> 10:44.289
Is that him?

10:44.354 --> 10:47.492
That's him, is it?

10:47.558 --> 10:50.261
That's him! That's him! That's him!

10:56.967 --> 11:00.205
[screaming]

11:13.584 --> 11:17.555
What are you doing so far away
from the village, boy?

11:19.957 --> 11:23.294
My shoulder... hurts so bad.

11:26.531 --> 11:30.367
[birds chirping]

11:31.569 --> 11:32.970
[groans]

11:33.037 --> 11:34.972
Wow.

11:35.039 --> 11:37.608
That was the weirdest dream.

11:39.110 --> 11:41.079
- Hungry, boy?
- Aah!

11:41.146 --> 11:43.081
You really exist?

11:43.148 --> 11:44.515
I'd like to think so.

11:44.582 --> 11:46.651
I put your shoulder
back in place for you.

11:46.717 --> 11:50.420
But you're a white wolf!
Are you gonna eat me?

11:50.487 --> 11:51.722
Not today.

11:51.789 --> 11:53.490
I can... I can go?

11:53.558 --> 11:56.761
Of course. Where will you go?

11:59.264 --> 12:01.932
I have to save my village
from the hyenas.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.768
Hyenas.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.571
Can I ask you something?

12:06.637 --> 12:09.339
If there's still
white wolves in the forest,

12:09.406 --> 12:11.475
why don't they protect our village?

12:11.542 --> 12:15.813
Because I'm the only one left.

12:17.514 --> 12:20.151
How do you plan to save
your village, boy?

12:21.086 --> 12:23.453
No idea.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.723
All I know is you can do anything

12:25.790 --> 12:28.325
if you wish for it with all your heart.

12:28.392 --> 12:30.561
What's your name?

12:30.628 --> 12:32.029
Savva.

12:32.097 --> 12:33.564
I'm Anggee.

12:33.631 --> 12:36.767
I may know someone who can help you.

12:42.406 --> 12:45.610
I don't get it.
Why can't we just eat them?

12:45.676 --> 12:48.512
Moron! That stinking Monkey queen

12:48.579 --> 12:51.116
has offered us a good deal
for these slaves.

12:51.182 --> 12:53.684
You would eat our profit?

13:00.691 --> 13:02.093
Ah!

13:02.160 --> 13:04.295
[growls]

13:04.361 --> 13:06.731
Are you trying to poison us?

13:06.797 --> 13:11.069
No. I... I didn't see that in my pile.

13:11.136 --> 13:13.403
Really, sweetheart?

13:13.470 --> 13:16.174
Throw her in the hole!

13:22.280 --> 13:24.082
Don't let them do this!

13:24.149 --> 13:26.184
Stand up to them!

13:34.959 --> 13:36.661
[screams]

13:40.798 --> 13:43.201
You see that mountain?

13:43.268 --> 13:46.536
At the very top lives a magician.

13:46.603 --> 13:51.209
I am on my way to see him
for reasons of my own.

13:51.276 --> 13:53.343
I believe there will be a warrior there

13:53.410 --> 13:55.213
who can free your village.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.882
So what are we waiting for? Let's go!

13:57.948 --> 13:59.650
Not so fast.

13:59.717 --> 14:02.253
We'll have to fight our way
through swamps

14:02.319 --> 14:04.021
and treacherous jungle,

14:04.089 --> 14:05.355
and when we reach the mountain,

14:05.422 --> 14:07.624
we will still have
to get past Mom Jozee,

14:07.692 --> 14:10.195
the three-headed Monkey queen.

14:10.261 --> 14:12.629
Three-headed Monkey queen?

14:12.697 --> 14:15.599
Really, you think I'm buying that? Huh!

14:15.666 --> 14:19.237
She was once a normal Monkey.

14:19.303 --> 14:24.008
But she was vain,
power-hungry and foolish.

14:24.075 --> 14:26.244
In order to teach her a lesson,

14:26.310 --> 14:29.280
the Magician split her into three parts,

14:29.346 --> 14:31.849
one head for each weakness,

14:31.916 --> 14:36.721
vanity, greed and stupidity.

14:36.787 --> 14:39.824
She was so angry that she had
her army surround the mountain

14:39.890 --> 14:42.927
and completely cut him off
from the outside world.

14:42.993 --> 14:46.964
She doesn't let anyone see the Magician.

14:47.031 --> 14:48.598
Well, how do we get through?

14:48.665 --> 14:51.736
I guess we'll have to wish for it,

14:51.802 --> 14:54.338
with all of our hearts.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.617
What is that?

15:09.486 --> 15:12.790
Oh, my friends! Are you here to save me?

15:12.857 --> 15:17.862
Are you here to get me
out of this terrible forest?

15:18.996 --> 15:20.497
What are you?

15:20.564 --> 15:22.200
What are you?

15:22.267 --> 15:24.001
I'm a boy.

15:26.603 --> 15:28.973
What's your name, tiny one?

15:34.011 --> 15:35.379
I think he means you.

15:35.445 --> 15:38.648
Oh! My name.

15:38.715 --> 15:40.851
Puffy. So where are we headed?

15:40.918 --> 15:42.053
We?

15:42.120 --> 15:46.057
You have to take me
out of this evil place!

15:46.124 --> 15:48.325
Don't leave me here!

15:48.392 --> 15:51.461
We're going to see the Magician
that lives on the mountain.

15:53.164 --> 15:54.631
We should keep moving.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.934
Well...

15:57.001 --> 15:58.769
good luck, Puffy.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.942
W-W-Wait!

16:05.009 --> 16:07.044
Don't leave me!

16:07.112 --> 16:10.815
You have to take me! I... I...

16:10.881 --> 16:12.983
I am going to see the Magician too!

16:13.051 --> 16:14.219
- You?
- Mm-hmm.

16:14.285 --> 16:15.220
Why?

16:15.286 --> 16:18.089
To break this hideous curse!

16:18.156 --> 16:20.091
To return to my former glory

16:20.158 --> 16:23.894
and shed this gruesome,
terrifying appearance.

16:23.961 --> 16:25.930
What curse? What do you mean?

16:25.996 --> 16:28.933
I am an enchanted prince.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.235
Oh, please!

16:30.300 --> 16:31.969
- It's true!
- Prove it!

16:32.036 --> 16:33.003
[distant screeching]

16:33.071 --> 16:34.972
- Monkeys.
- Monkeys?

16:35.039 --> 16:35.973
Ohh...

16:36.040 --> 16:37.774
[screeching]

16:37.842 --> 16:41.045
I will have each and every one of you

16:41.112 --> 16:43.513
flayed in the royal court!

16:45.950 --> 16:47.885
[growling]

16:55.993 --> 16:59.064
Unhand that man or face my wrath!

17:08.906 --> 17:10.208
What?

17:10.275 --> 17:11.540
[roars]

17:15.444 --> 17:17.646
I'm not going anywhere!

17:17.714 --> 17:20.784
Can't hide from Terminator!

17:23.188 --> 17:25.021
Hi-yah!

17:27.424 --> 17:29.094
Don't you dare touch my coat!

17:34.331 --> 17:37.968
I see I'm going to have to
give you some fighting lessons.

17:38.035 --> 17:40.071
Who are you?

17:41.471 --> 17:44.109
My name is Savva. This is Anggee.

17:44.175 --> 17:47.178
I am Semi-Baron Fafl.

17:47.245 --> 17:50.014
I am no ordinary semi-baron.

17:50.081 --> 17:52.283
I am an enchanted prince.

17:52.349 --> 17:54.085
Of course you are.

17:54.152 --> 17:57.587
Everyone in this forest
is an enchanted prince.

17:57.654 --> 17:59.689
Ah, but I truly am.

17:59.756 --> 18:04.694
Before this wretched curse,
women fought over me.

18:04.761 --> 18:07.431
Literally, they fought in tournaments

18:07.497 --> 18:09.366
with swords and spears.

18:09.433 --> 18:11.401
They would beat each other with cudgels

18:11.468 --> 18:13.938
just for the favor of my glance.

18:14.004 --> 18:15.140
[farts]

18:15.206 --> 18:16.241
Ohh!

18:16.306 --> 18:18.575
Now that was a noble gesture.

18:18.642 --> 18:21.011
Quiet, pink one! That was not me.

18:21.079 --> 18:23.013
Not you? We all heard it.

18:23.081 --> 18:25.815
It's not me!

18:25.882 --> 18:29.486
He's telling the truth.
It was his passenger.

18:29.553 --> 18:33.423
Oh, alas, I can not get rid of him.

18:33.490 --> 18:36.061
The spell was cast upon the both of us

18:36.127 --> 18:38.129
by a vile, angry witch.

18:38.196 --> 18:41.698
She was in love with me,
as most girls are.

18:41.765 --> 18:44.135
The mosquito bit her right on the nose.

18:44.202 --> 18:46.836
It was quite hideous, red and bumpy.

18:46.903 --> 18:49.773
Of course, I had no choice
but to spurn her.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.541
Why, they used to fight over me!

18:51.608 --> 18:53.178
Why can't you get rid of him?

18:53.244 --> 18:55.879
[gasps]
I am doubly cursed.

18:55.946 --> 18:58.482
First, this horrid appearance,

18:58.548 --> 19:00.484
a curse which I do not know
how to break.

19:00.550 --> 19:02.686
[screams]

19:02.752 --> 19:07.424
And second, she doomed us
to be together forever.

19:07.491 --> 19:09.094
The spell is very crafty.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.363
It cannot be broken until...
we agree on something.

19:13.430 --> 19:14.864
Isn't that tragic?

19:14.931 --> 19:18.069
Why don't you just agree
to go your separate ways?

19:18.136 --> 19:20.238
He is a mosquito!

19:20.304 --> 19:22.439
I am a semi-baron!

19:22.506 --> 19:26.876
It would be beneath my dignity
to even speak to him,

19:26.943 --> 19:29.080
let alone agree on anything.

19:29.147 --> 19:31.615
He is below my station.

19:31.681 --> 19:33.650
And below our nostrils.

19:33.717 --> 19:35.652
I am traveling to see the Magician

19:35.719 --> 19:37.654
- who lives on the mountain.
- Savva, don't...

19:37.721 --> 19:40.225
Hey, we're going to see
the Magician too!

19:40.291 --> 19:41.925
Oh, great.

19:41.992 --> 19:44.628
Then I will allow you
to travel by my side

19:44.694 --> 19:47.897
as long as you stay two steps behind me.

19:47.964 --> 19:54.072
And I am not responsible
for that abomination.

19:54.139 --> 19:55.672
Aah!

19:57.273 --> 19:58.373
I wonder if we know him.

20:24.235 --> 20:25.502
Another dart.

20:25.569 --> 20:28.139
Mom, you're the absolute best,
the cat's meow.

20:28.206 --> 20:30.707
Your skills are gonna make us
the toast of the town.

20:30.774 --> 20:33.410
Zee, ain't she marvelous?
[kissing]

20:33.477 --> 20:36.846
Oh, I'm sorry, I was thinking.

20:36.913 --> 20:39.084
I thought I smelled something burning.

20:39.150 --> 20:42.586
What could you possibly
have been thinking about?

20:42.652 --> 20:46.124
If more than one mouse is mice,

20:46.191 --> 20:50.794
and if more than one louse is lice,

20:50.860 --> 20:53.064
is more than one spouse...

20:53.131 --> 20:55.632
Spice?

20:55.699 --> 20:57.334
You're an idiot.

20:57.401 --> 20:58.702
[gasps]
Oh!

20:58.768 --> 21:00.937
And just what are you
staring at, darling?

21:02.073 --> 21:03.640
Well, Ma, it's like this, see.

21:03.707 --> 21:05.076
We built a trap in the woods

21:05.143 --> 21:07.103
and waited for a sucker
to come along and fall in.

21:07.145 --> 21:08.612
Finally this pigeon took the bait.

21:08.678 --> 21:11.014
Bam! Right into the trap
like a blind alley cat.

21:11.082 --> 21:14.017
That sentence needs
at least two more metaphors.

21:14.085 --> 21:15.318
He was a hideous-looking fella,

21:15.319 --> 21:16.886
with a mosquito riding on his shoulder

21:16.953 --> 21:18.189
on a tiny little throne.

21:18.256 --> 21:20.490
A mosquito on a throne?

21:20.557 --> 21:22.992
On the level, Ma. No sooner were
we putting the screws to him

21:23.060 --> 21:25.562
then these three palookas come
out of the woods and took us on.

21:25.629 --> 21:28.698
Oh, I love a good fight story!

21:28.765 --> 21:30.300
But here's the twist.

21:30.367 --> 21:32.736
The first one out of the woods
was a white wolf.

21:32.802 --> 21:34.438
A white wolf?

21:34.504 --> 21:37.242
Have you been playing
in the hemp groves again?

21:37.307 --> 21:39.110
It's the straight dope, Ma.
It's all jake.

21:39.177 --> 21:40.677
He had a little boy with him too,

21:40.744 --> 21:41.811
and a little pink dame.

21:41.878 --> 21:43.613
And why do I care about this?

21:43.680 --> 21:46.251
Because we stuck around the
woods, see, to drop some eaves.

21:46.316 --> 21:48.796
We heard them say they're all on
their way to see the Magician.

21:48.818 --> 21:50.954
What'd I miss?

21:51.020 --> 21:54.824
Torpedoes! To me now!

21:54.891 --> 21:58.995
I need you to do what you do best.

21:59.063 --> 22:01.731
No! I don't mean chasing girls.

22:01.798 --> 22:04.269
Tell us what to do, Mom.

22:04.334 --> 22:06.002
I need you to spy.

22:06.070 --> 22:09.073
I want you to know
every move the invaders make.

22:09.140 --> 22:11.308
Every step they take. Is that clear?

22:15.579 --> 22:17.814
[evil laughter]

22:17.881 --> 22:21.718
Because after we're done
feeding on your harvest,

22:21.785 --> 22:24.088
we're taking you to Mom.

22:24.155 --> 22:27.657
[evil laughter]

22:27.724 --> 22:29.059
[gasps]

22:57.222 --> 22:58.155
[twig snaps]

22:59.656 --> 23:00.824
Hello?

23:09.699 --> 23:11.034
Anggee! I saw...

23:11.101 --> 23:12.102
[fart]

23:12.169 --> 23:16.373
- Oh, not again!
- What do you want?

23:16.440 --> 23:20.009
The next time you feel one of
those coming on, warn us, okay?

23:20.077 --> 23:22.812
Sorry, pal, but when I sleep,
I can't control myself.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.082
Oh, yeah, sometimes I can't either.

23:25.149 --> 23:27.484
Sometimes I swat bugs in my sleep.

23:27.551 --> 23:31.088
My God! Where is the pink powder puff?

23:32.922 --> 23:35.825
SAVVA: Puffy? Puffy!

23:35.892 --> 23:37.061
ANGGEE: He's gone.

23:37.127 --> 23:38.562
FAFL: That's gratitude for you.

23:38.628 --> 23:42.366
You save him from the forest,
and he abandons you.

23:42.432 --> 23:45.302
He didn't run off. Someone took him.

23:45.369 --> 23:46.536
There are tracks. Look.

23:46.603 --> 23:49.573
We have to go find him.
He could be in danger.

23:49.639 --> 23:53.910
I am not going to risk my life
for six ounces of fluff.

23:53.977 --> 23:57.814
We can't just leave him.

23:57.881 --> 23:59.549
The semi-baron is right.

23:59.616 --> 24:02.253
It's too dangerous. We should skedaddle.

24:02.319 --> 24:03.787
Wait, wait.

24:03.853 --> 24:05.021
Um...

24:05.089 --> 24:07.657
No! The bug is wrong.

24:07.724 --> 24:10.295
We must save the furball.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.361
Mm-mm.

24:15.632 --> 24:17.067
Poor Puffy.

24:17.134 --> 24:19.636
He must be terrified.

24:19.703 --> 24:24.208
[tribal music]

24:24.275 --> 24:27.644
What's the racket, hmm? Eh?

24:27.711 --> 24:30.180
Makatunga.

24:30.247 --> 24:32.283
Makatunga.

24:32.349 --> 24:33.483
[cheering]

24:33.550 --> 24:34.851
Guys?

24:34.918 --> 24:37.754
Someone want to tell me what's going on?

24:37.821 --> 24:39.789
[cheering continues]

24:39.856 --> 24:42.359
Oh, wow.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.138
O great Makatunga!

24:54.204 --> 24:59.609
Finally you have
revealed yourself to us!

24:59.676 --> 25:02.779
We can fulfill our destiny now

25:02.846 --> 25:08.152
on this buljoo we call earth.

25:12.389 --> 25:15.925
They think I'm some Makatunga.

25:15.992 --> 25:21.098
[clamoring]

25:26.536 --> 25:28.705
What shall I do?

25:28.772 --> 25:29.739
Ah!

25:29.806 --> 25:31.508
Cloud!

25:33.477 --> 25:34.544
Uh...

25:34.611 --> 25:39.283
Makatunga will speak.

25:43.653 --> 25:46.322
I will make it rain!

25:48.758 --> 25:52.162
[humming]

25:55.599 --> 25:57.801
[humming continues]

25:57.867 --> 26:01.471
Come on, cloud.

26:01.538 --> 26:03.339
[humming]

26:07.043 --> 26:08.712
[humming]

26:08.778 --> 26:11.281
* Pour some rain *

26:11.347 --> 26:13.050
[humming]

26:13.117 --> 26:16.019
* A few drops will do *

26:16.086 --> 26:19.355
[humming]

26:19.423 --> 26:21.991
* Or I'll be their lunch today *

26:23.760 --> 26:28.598
[tribal music]

26:35.839 --> 26:40.777
* The swamp is sticky
and sometimes a little dark *

26:40.844 --> 26:42.212
Thank you, cloud.

26:42.279 --> 26:44.281
* And hard to get around *

26:44.347 --> 26:48.618
* Now we have someone
who can make a paradise *

26:48.685 --> 26:51.955
[yawns]

26:53.523 --> 26:57.161
* Build a sweet, sweet swamp *

26:57.227 --> 26:59.296
* Bring us some climate change *

26:59.362 --> 27:01.698
* And build a spa resort *

27:01.765 --> 27:04.768
[continues music]

27:04.834 --> 27:06.770
It's really creepy out here.

27:06.836 --> 27:07.837
Yeah.

27:07.904 --> 27:11.141
* Swamp, swamp, swamp *

27:11.208 --> 27:15.679
* Swamp, sweet swamp *

27:15.745 --> 27:18.648
* Waaaah *

27:18.715 --> 27:19.983
Aaah!

27:20.050 --> 27:23.587
* Make the sun shine bright *

27:23.653 --> 27:27.757
* O Makatunga Mama Makatunga *

27:27.824 --> 27:32.129
* And turn it off at night *

27:32.196 --> 27:36.066
* O Makatunga Mama Makatunga *

27:36.133 --> 27:37.601
Makatunga!

27:39.769 --> 27:41.838
- [humming]
- Fafl!

27:41.905 --> 27:43.039
- Sorry.
- [farts]

27:43.107 --> 27:45.075
Excuse me.

27:46.243 --> 27:49.479
* Do it all *

27:49.546 --> 27:53.817
* O Makatunga Ma Makatunga *

27:53.883 --> 27:57.154
[continues music]

28:02.592 --> 28:03.760
[ends music]

28:09.866 --> 28:12.435
Anggee, what are those?

28:12.502 --> 28:15.139
I don't like the look of this.

28:15.205 --> 28:18.041
My, it must be Halloween already.

28:18.108 --> 28:21.245
These decorations are simply grand.

28:21.310 --> 28:24.313
I must remember
to congratulate whoever...

28:27.917 --> 28:29.686
What?

28:38.995 --> 28:41.198
I suppose it is too much to hope

28:41.265 --> 28:44.234
that these are just Halloween costumes?

28:52.142 --> 28:53.577
I'll draw them away!

29:11.628 --> 29:13.630
Whoa!

29:15.799 --> 29:17.400
Come on, catch up!

29:23.140 --> 29:25.775
[screams]

29:27.877 --> 29:29.412
[screams]

29:29.478 --> 29:32.282
Will you stop that shaking?
I am trying to have lunch here.

29:32.348 --> 29:33.817
Shut it! I'm busy!

29:41.291 --> 29:43.927
Cheers to you, Fafl.
Hope you don't get cut.

29:43.993 --> 29:47.197
I got you!
[laughs]

30:08.584 --> 30:11.688
What's the holdup, Fafl?
Go save the boy!

30:11.755 --> 30:13.823
Anggee!

30:19.929 --> 30:22.632
[drums beating]

30:22.699 --> 30:23.767
Where are we?

30:23.833 --> 30:27.603
Keep quiet. I've been here before.

30:45.189 --> 30:47.891
[growling]

30:52.862 --> 30:55.364
Savva, are you okay?

30:55.431 --> 30:57.067
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:57.134 --> 31:00.303
O great Makatunga.

31:00.369 --> 31:03.140
We ask your guidance.

31:03.207 --> 31:06.910
Come forward and give your word of law.

31:06.976 --> 31:10.313
Should these trespassers
be allowed to live

31:10.379 --> 31:15.584
or should they be put to a slow,
horrible, painful death?

31:18.288 --> 31:20.290
[cheering]

31:23.727 --> 31:24.928
Puffy?

31:24.994 --> 31:28.232
I do not know this Puffy
of whom you speak.

31:28.298 --> 31:32.802
I am Makatunga!

31:36.806 --> 31:41.111
God of the Swamp People.

31:41.178 --> 31:43.346
God?

31:43.412 --> 31:45.749
You're not a God. You're...

31:46.816 --> 31:48.185
A God. Definitely a God.

31:48.252 --> 31:49.719
Wait, wait. Let me understand.

31:49.786 --> 31:53.723
You people are being ruled
by a talking oven mitt?

31:53.790 --> 31:57.794
O great Makatunga, what is your will?

31:57.861 --> 32:02.498
Shall they live or shall they die?

32:02.565 --> 32:04.801
You really have to think about it?

32:04.868 --> 32:07.003
Kill them!

32:15.711 --> 32:17.313
Just kidding, just kidding.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.916
Let them live.
[laughs]

32:21.785 --> 32:23.652
Stinker!

32:23.719 --> 32:24.653
[gasps]

32:25.755 --> 32:26.923
Rickies.

32:26.990 --> 32:28.657
I hate those guys.

32:28.724 --> 32:31.161
Why are they following our followees?

32:31.228 --> 32:33.462
Somebody better go tell Mom.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.749
Everyone! Be quiet!

32:53.817 --> 32:55.985
I am sad today.

32:56.053 --> 32:58.288
La-la-la...

32:58.354 --> 33:00.323
Are you deaf?

33:08.298 --> 33:09.998
I don't know who these people
that we're following,

33:09.999 --> 33:11.667
but we're not the only ones interested.

33:11.734 --> 33:13.469
The Rickies are following them too.

33:13.536 --> 33:16.305
Rickies? What on earth?

33:16.372 --> 33:17.606
Whatever their reasons are,

33:17.673 --> 33:19.608
those Rickies never mean any good.

33:19.675 --> 33:21.710
They must be as intrigued as we are

33:21.777 --> 33:24.248
by the sudden appearance
of a white wolf.

33:24.313 --> 33:26.883
Mom, you are so smart.

33:26.950 --> 33:29.752
You make us all look like geniuses!

33:29.819 --> 33:33.123
Gorgeous, ravishing geniuses!

33:33.190 --> 33:35.259
Quiet! I need to think.

33:35.324 --> 33:39.328
I've thought it over,
and the answer's no.

33:39.395 --> 33:42.698
I'm definitely not deaf.

33:59.815 --> 34:00.816
[whispers]

34:10.127 --> 34:12.027
Shi-Sha.

34:12.096 --> 34:15.664
Shi-Sha!

34:15.731 --> 34:16.532
No.

34:16.599 --> 34:20.137
Shaman Shi-Sha is my name.

34:22.972 --> 34:24.373
Of course it is.

34:24.440 --> 34:27.277
I was drinking to your health.

34:27.342 --> 34:31.647
This here my granddaughter, Nanty.

34:31.714 --> 34:34.817
Semi-baron Fafl at your service.

34:34.884 --> 34:37.887
My name is Savva. This is Anggee.

34:37.954 --> 34:41.991
Anggee and I old friends,
aren't we, cher?

34:42.059 --> 34:44.327
[chuckles]

34:44.393 --> 34:46.130
It held.

34:46.196 --> 34:50.199
Yes. You still think
you can't do it for the others?

34:50.266 --> 34:53.036
I don't have the strength.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.105
I'm old and weak now.

34:55.172 --> 34:56.338
What are you guys talking about?

34:56.339 --> 34:57.974
Have you been watching us?

34:58.041 --> 35:03.412
My Nanty have been watching
this li'l skinny mullet here.

35:03.479 --> 35:06.250
Watching me? Why?

35:06.315 --> 35:14.158
We are waiting for the one
with the heart of the warrior.

35:14.224 --> 35:16.659
[laughing]

35:16.725 --> 35:19.695
I'm afraid you are a scentless dog

35:19.762 --> 35:22.431
hunting the wrong fox.

35:26.103 --> 35:28.471
No offense.

35:35.945 --> 35:38.747
I just wanted to pay my respects.

35:38.814 --> 35:41.951
I can't hurt him. He's a God.

35:54.131 --> 35:55.299
Hey! Puffy-tunga!

35:55.364 --> 35:56.966
[gasps]
Savva!

35:57.033 --> 36:00.369
I'm so happy! I missed you!

36:00.436 --> 36:03.240
Come on, slip into my shirt.
I can get you out of here.

36:03.306 --> 36:04.873
I don't want to get out of here.

36:04.940 --> 36:05.741
What?

36:05.808 --> 36:08.278
This is the greatest thing ever.

36:08.344 --> 36:10.214
These people think I'm a God.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.216
They wait on me hand and foot.

36:12.282 --> 36:13.948
What do you think's gonna happen
when they find out

36:13.949 --> 36:16.319
you're just an ordinary...
whatever you are?

36:16.385 --> 36:19.788
I'm not going anywhere, Savva.
I want to stay.

36:19.855 --> 36:22.992
What's the worst that could happen?

36:24.061 --> 36:26.130
You're gonna do what to him?

36:28.232 --> 36:31.034
Sit down. You've got to hear this.

36:31.101 --> 36:34.138
Tell him what you told me. Go on.

36:34.204 --> 36:37.141
Our oldest stories tell us

36:37.207 --> 36:40.144
that our God, Makatunga,

36:40.210 --> 36:42.545
has been lost,

36:42.611 --> 36:47.016
wandering in the swamp
for thousands of years.

36:47.084 --> 36:52.821
It is our duty to help him
ascend back to heaven.

36:52.888 --> 36:54.191
You're gonna kill him?

36:54.258 --> 36:57.993
- That's why he came here.
- [laughs]

36:58.062 --> 37:01.464
I wish I could see
the little chew toy's face

37:01.530 --> 37:03.200
when he figures that out.

37:03.267 --> 37:04.633
Grandpa!

37:04.700 --> 37:06.769
My popchock found something.

37:16.345 --> 37:18.481
What is she talking about?

37:18.547 --> 37:20.683
My skull bowl has audio.

37:26.223 --> 37:27.890
It's stop.

37:27.956 --> 37:29.892
Well, the visuals were great,

37:29.958 --> 37:32.296
but there was not much of a plot.

37:32.361 --> 37:35.065
I read lips.

37:35.132 --> 37:37.566
She was talking about y'all.

37:37.633 --> 37:38.867
What about us?

37:38.934 --> 37:41.537
She said she never going
to let you through

37:41.604 --> 37:44.074
to see the Magic Man.

37:44.141 --> 37:47.910
She'll use her whole army
to keep you out.

37:47.976 --> 37:50.346
She gonna kill y'all.

37:50.413 --> 37:53.416
The four of us will never
get through her ranks.

37:53.482 --> 37:56.220
I guess we'll have to find another way.

37:56.286 --> 37:57.753
Okay, let's go.

37:57.820 --> 38:01.291
But I gotta make one quick stop.

38:12.535 --> 38:15.105
Put me down! I command you!

38:15.172 --> 38:19.243
The God of the swamp commands you!

38:25.047 --> 38:27.816
[panting]

38:27.883 --> 38:30.486
I think it's safe
to stop here for the night.

38:30.553 --> 38:32.321
Ah, thank God!

38:40.729 --> 38:43.399
Try not to trip over your tongue.

38:43.466 --> 38:45.033
Why are you following us?

38:45.101 --> 38:49.372
It is obvious. The poor girl
is in the throes of amour.

38:49.438 --> 38:53.177
Deep, torturous, oblivious love.

38:58.847 --> 39:01.650
In the past, girls her age

39:01.717 --> 39:04.353
have fought epic battles over me.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.721
What? You?

39:05.788 --> 39:07.490
You think she's in love with you?

39:07.556 --> 39:09.558
Yes, of course!

39:09.625 --> 39:11.161
Who else? The little boy?

39:11.228 --> 39:13.429
The pink marshmallow? The puppy dog?

39:13.496 --> 39:16.699
My guess is you're
the last one on her list.

39:16.765 --> 39:19.435
Please, I want to come with you
on your journey.

39:19.502 --> 39:22.071
- Why?
- It is obvious, isn't it?

39:22.138 --> 39:24.373
I have reasons of my own.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.542
May I tag along?

39:26.609 --> 39:29.478
Why not? Why should there be
one person in this forest

39:29.545 --> 39:31.747
that doesn't join our trek?

39:31.814 --> 39:32.781
Thank you.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.350
[whining]

39:34.417 --> 39:35.851
Makatunga!

39:35.918 --> 39:37.386
No, Princess. That's just Puffy.

39:37.453 --> 39:38.521
He's not a God.

39:38.587 --> 39:41.724
What? But the prophecy...

39:41.790 --> 39:43.726
It was a mistake. He's just...

39:43.792 --> 39:46.230
He just a... He just a...

39:46.296 --> 39:47.297
That.

40:15.658 --> 40:18.127
[snores]

40:42.118 --> 40:45.388
Now I understand.
Now I understand what you are.

40:45.454 --> 40:47.056
I must warn Savva!

41:18.654 --> 41:19.988
I can't believe it.

41:20.056 --> 41:22.558
ZEE: Mom! Show us how to...

41:22.625 --> 41:28.431
Majesty, you are so lovely,
so wonderful, so ravishing,

41:28.497 --> 41:29.498
so beautiful.

41:29.565 --> 41:31.500
[kissing]

41:36.405 --> 41:37.906
Well?

41:37.973 --> 41:42.111
[gibberish]

41:49.485 --> 41:51.620
On our way to slay the hikers,
per your instructions,

41:51.687 --> 41:54.623
we followed the wolf's track,
and then we saw a Rickie.

41:54.690 --> 41:56.392
- Rickies?
- It's crazy!

41:56.459 --> 41:58.894
He changed into a Rickie,
and then after a moment,

41:58.961 --> 42:01.697
he changed back into a white wolf.

42:01.764 --> 42:05.968
Rickies turned into white wolves?

42:06.034 --> 42:07.603
Of course!

42:07.670 --> 42:09.272
That's it!

42:09.338 --> 42:10.305
Red Brain!

42:10.373 --> 42:12.408
Yes, Madam?

42:12.475 --> 42:14.610
The Rickies are a terrible enemy,

42:14.677 --> 42:17.012
but they are better
than the white wolves.

42:17.080 --> 42:18.447
They protected the humans.

42:18.514 --> 42:20.749
I'll never get my slaves if they return.

42:20.816 --> 42:22.518
We are going to war!

42:22.585 --> 42:25.488
Against the wolves, madam?

42:25.554 --> 42:27.156
But they are extinct.

42:27.223 --> 42:29.858
No! Against the Rickies!

42:29.925 --> 42:31.560
Go to them!

42:31.627 --> 42:34.463
Tell them we are at war!

42:34.530 --> 42:38.067
You want me to go to the Rickies?

42:38.134 --> 42:40.736
Walk right in to their palace?

42:40.803 --> 42:42.337
Yes, Madam.

42:42.405 --> 42:46.308
Shall I take the royal guard
for protection?

42:46.375 --> 42:51.714
I can't afford to lose
any of them before a war.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.416
Take the Crackers.

42:53.482 --> 42:54.850
Crackers!

42:54.917 --> 42:58.187
You wanted to talk to us, Ms. Mom?

42:58.254 --> 43:02.058
You will accompany Red Brain
to the Rickie castle.

43:02.125 --> 43:04.093
Hoo-whee! The Rickie castle!

43:04.160 --> 43:06.495
Well, if that don't beat all!

43:06.562 --> 43:08.064
[laughing]

43:08.131 --> 43:10.633
- Indubitably.
- If we're going to war,

43:10.699 --> 43:14.302
I'm gonna need a whole new
camouflage wardrobe.

43:14.369 --> 43:16.539
Spread the word across the forest,

43:16.605 --> 43:19.575
around the mountains, far and wide.

43:19.642 --> 43:23.846
The Monkeys have declared war
on the Rickies!

43:23.912 --> 43:27.683
[clamoring]

43:27.750 --> 43:28.784
Wait a minute.

43:28.851 --> 43:31.454
What just happened?

43:33.656 --> 43:37.160
Where's Nanty? Where's Anggee?
Did anyone see where they went?

43:37.226 --> 43:39.828
Guys, something's coming.

43:39.895 --> 43:42.831
Something big! Ohh!

43:42.898 --> 43:44.933
Nanty, where have you been?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.635
Are you okay?

43:46.702 --> 43:50.806
Your friend the wolf,
he not so much wolf, cher.

43:50.873 --> 43:54.042
- What do you mean?
- I saw him in the woods.

43:54.110 --> 43:57.045
He got plenty dark magic, Savva.

43:57.113 --> 44:00.149
- I saw him transform.
- Into what?

44:00.216 --> 44:03.018
Your wolf friend, he's a Rickie.

44:03.086 --> 44:05.888
- No.
- I know what I seen, sure.

44:05.954 --> 44:08.356
No, you got confused, and it was dark.

44:08.423 --> 44:11.260
She's telling the truth. I am a Rickie.

44:11.326 --> 44:12.828
Oh!

44:12.895 --> 44:16.364
Sucks! Well, I never!

44:16.431 --> 44:18.867
If you can't trust the family
dog, who can you trust?

44:18.934 --> 44:20.636
I can explain.

44:20.703 --> 44:22.404
Explain?

44:22.471 --> 44:25.074
You've been lying to me this whole time!

44:25.141 --> 44:26.209
- I had to.
- Why?

44:26.275 --> 44:28.111
So you could lure me out here?

44:28.177 --> 44:30.579
So you can feed my soul
to your Rickie friends?

44:30.646 --> 44:32.314
It's not like that. Trust me.

44:32.380 --> 44:34.783
I can't trust you!
I don't know who you are!

44:34.850 --> 44:37.220
I don't even know what species you are!

44:37.286 --> 44:39.188
I'm your friend, like always.

44:39.255 --> 44:41.057
No! You're a liar!

44:41.124 --> 44:42.558
I thought you could really help me!

44:42.625 --> 44:44.560
- Savva, please!
- Leave me alone!

44:49.898 --> 44:52.268
Well, this is awkward.

44:52.334 --> 44:56.304
How could you, wolf?
That boy loved you.

44:56.371 --> 44:57.873
- I'll go after him.
- No!

44:57.940 --> 45:02.611
You get away from us,
and you stay away from him!

45:02.678 --> 45:05.581
- I can still help.
- We don't need your help.

45:05.648 --> 45:06.615
Go away!

45:09.618 --> 45:13.222
Well, I guess I'm in charge now.

45:14.090 --> 45:15.457
Can't trust anyone!

45:15.524 --> 45:17.560
Wish for it with all my heart. Hah!

45:17.626 --> 45:20.028
Everyone is just out for themselves.

45:20.096 --> 45:22.298
[thump]

45:24.600 --> 45:26.135
[thump]

45:29.905 --> 45:32.507
[rumbling]

45:45.487 --> 45:47.022
Anggee!

45:47.090 --> 45:48.691
Savva!

45:50.025 --> 45:50.993
What was that?

45:51.060 --> 45:52.995
A Rickie.

45:53.062 --> 45:54.830
A big Rickie.

45:54.897 --> 45:56.031
Oh!

45:56.099 --> 45:58.234
Well, what do we do, leader?

45:58.300 --> 45:59.602
I'm not a leader.

45:59.668 --> 46:00.568
You just said you were.

46:00.569 --> 46:01.937
That's before you said I was.

46:02.004 --> 46:03.606
Now that you said I am, I am not.

46:03.672 --> 46:06.541
- Oh, come on!
- No, you come on!

46:06.609 --> 46:09.678
Who are you to tell me to come on?

46:09.745 --> 46:10.779
- I...
- Fine.

46:10.846 --> 46:12.115
You're not the leader.

46:12.181 --> 46:14.917
Yes, I am.

46:14.983 --> 46:16.451
Let's go rescue Savva.

46:31.466 --> 46:33.401
Anggee!

46:33.468 --> 46:35.638
Savva!

47:09.105 --> 47:11.306
Why are you doing this?

47:11.373 --> 47:14.542
It's your father's order!

47:22.317 --> 47:24.519
Anggee, help!

47:25.620 --> 47:27.690
I'll save you, Savva!

47:33.996 --> 47:35.397
[grunts]

47:57.953 --> 48:00.488
Anggee!

48:11.033 --> 48:12.334
All right, Father.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.636
I will come.

48:18.241 --> 48:20.809
Hey! Let me out!

48:27.515 --> 48:30.452
How am I gonna save my Mom now?

48:30.518 --> 48:33.455
What's gonna happen to my village?

48:41.429 --> 48:44.300
[evil laughter]

48:46.269 --> 48:48.771
Wherever you are, Savva,

48:48.837 --> 48:52.875
know that I am looking at the same moon.

49:09.058 --> 49:14.263
Now you kneel before me?

49:14.329 --> 49:16.132
I've come to apologize, Father.

49:16.199 --> 49:19.968
I know that I let you down,
but why did you take the boy?

49:20.035 --> 49:25.407
You would have never come
if I had not done it.

49:25.473 --> 49:29.644
What's so special about this boy?

49:29.711 --> 49:32.347
He reminds me of what we really are.

49:32.414 --> 49:35.417
They say that you managed
to lift the curse

49:35.483 --> 49:38.954
and walk as a wolf again.

49:39.021 --> 49:41.389
Maybe I can do it for the rest of us

49:41.456 --> 49:44.459
if Savva and I can get to the Magician.

49:44.526 --> 49:47.329
Father, can your troops help us
get through the Monkeys

49:47.395 --> 49:49.364
to the Magician?

49:49.431 --> 49:52.367
You chose this path.

49:52.434 --> 49:55.804
I am happy as a Rickie.

49:55.871 --> 50:00.308
I don't want to change back.

50:00.375 --> 50:03.511
Then I will take the boy and go.

50:08.416 --> 50:11.187
You may end up alone.

50:11.254 --> 50:15.623
I am always alone.

50:50.993 --> 50:52.961
Come with me if you want to live.

50:53.028 --> 50:56.232
Really? That's a pretty corny line.

50:56.299 --> 50:59.034
Savva, get up now.

51:03.405 --> 51:05.040
Is it really you?

51:05.108 --> 51:07.575
I'll explain later.

51:09.112 --> 51:13.615
And so it is my duty to inform you

51:13.681 --> 51:16.152
that because of your warrantless actions

51:16.219 --> 51:20.256
to help the human boy
get to the Magician,

51:20.322 --> 51:23.992
Her Majesty Mom Jozee,

51:24.060 --> 51:26.394
monarch of Monkeys,

51:26.461 --> 51:28.396
champion of chimps

51:28.463 --> 51:30.966
and Goddess of gorillas,

51:31.033 --> 51:34.536
has declared war upon the Rickies.

51:34.602 --> 51:38.506
How dare she.

51:42.111 --> 51:43.912
War, it is.

51:58.460 --> 52:01.197
Look, nobody is here.

52:05.101 --> 52:08.937
Probably they knew that I was coming.

52:11.806 --> 52:13.575
[gasps]

52:13.641 --> 52:16.632
Ah! Uh-huh.

52:16.644 --> 52:18.313
Hi, guys!

52:18.380 --> 52:19.547
Hello!

52:19.614 --> 52:22.684
Where is the, um...

52:22.750 --> 52:24.652
the washroom here?

52:29.192 --> 52:30.825
Look, what I've got!

52:30.892 --> 52:31.859
Makatunga!

52:31.926 --> 52:34.130
The God of the Swamp People!

52:34.197 --> 52:36.698
I wouldn't mess with me if I were you

52:36.764 --> 52:38.700
unless you want to get yourselves

52:38.766 --> 52:41.270
into a serious trouble!

52:41.336 --> 52:43.938
I am Semi-baron Fafl!

52:44.006 --> 52:49.112
Women have fought epic battles over me!

52:49.178 --> 52:54.949
Well, guess there's no point
to continue this conversation.

52:55.017 --> 52:56.484
Thank you, goodbye,

52:56.551 --> 52:58.753
good luck and so long!

52:59.683 --> 53:01.685
[gasps]

53:04.093 --> 53:05.793
Death dealer!

53:07.929 --> 53:12.434
Death dealer! Death dealer!
Death dealer! Death dealer!

53:12.500 --> 53:16.272
Death dealer! Death dealer!
Death dealer! Death dealer!

53:16.338 --> 53:17.805
Why are they scared of you?

53:17.872 --> 53:21.443
They recognize my natural
physical prowess.

53:21.509 --> 53:25.047
I am Semi-baron Fafl!

53:25.114 --> 53:27.482
Never forget that name!

53:27.549 --> 53:29.451
That was weird.

53:29.517 --> 53:30.552
What next?

53:30.618 --> 53:33.056
Now we need a plan.

53:39.062 --> 53:39.794
NANTY: Savva!

53:39.861 --> 53:41.529
Nanty! Fafl! Puffy!

53:41.596 --> 53:45.733
Thank goodness you're alive.
We went in after you.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.402
What? How did you escape?

53:47.469 --> 53:49.904
It's me. It was me.
They were all afraid of me.

53:49.971 --> 53:52.907
- That was true. Terrified, really.
- It's the truth.

53:52.974 --> 53:55.343
I've never seen anything like it.

53:55.410 --> 53:57.679
They ran from him.

53:57.745 --> 53:59.381
How did you escape?

53:59.447 --> 54:02.317
- Anggee got me out.
- It don't add up, pal.

54:02.384 --> 54:05.154
If he's a Rickie, why would he
save you from his own outfit?

54:06.721 --> 54:08.323
Yeah, why?

54:10.725 --> 54:13.296
Gather around, and I'll tell you.

54:16.431 --> 54:20.034
ANGGEE: You all know the story
of the white wolves.

54:20.103 --> 54:24.140
We had lived in harmony with man
for hundreds of years,

54:24.207 --> 54:26.574
protecting them from their enemies

54:26.641 --> 54:29.677
until, in a time of desperate hunger,

54:29.744 --> 54:32.680
our leader, my father,

54:32.747 --> 54:35.251
- attacked a human.
- [woman screams]

54:35.317 --> 54:38.019
As punishment for attacking humans,

54:38.087 --> 54:41.689
the Magician gave us human form.

54:41.756 --> 54:43.126
The white wolves are the Rickies.

54:43.192 --> 54:44.227
Yes.

54:44.293 --> 54:45.960
Now skip ahead, get to the good part.

54:46.027 --> 54:47.895
Why are the Rickies afraid of me?

54:47.962 --> 54:51.134
It was the cruelest part of the curse.

54:51.200 --> 54:56.538
Because we had come to think of
ourselves as such mighty beasts,

54:56.604 --> 54:58.606
the Magician made us vulnerable

54:58.673 --> 55:01.210
to the tiniest creature in the forest.

55:01.277 --> 55:04.011
- You're kidding. Seriously?
- Yes.

55:04.079 --> 55:08.483
A Rickie can be killed instantly
by a single bite...

55:08.550 --> 55:10.085
From a mosquito.

55:10.153 --> 55:11.086
Me?

55:11.154 --> 55:12.920
Wait a minute...

55:12.987 --> 55:16.891
I'm sorry, Fafl, but it
wasn't you they were afraid of.

55:16.958 --> 55:18.693
Well, what do you know about that?

55:18.760 --> 55:19.761
Impossible!

55:19.827 --> 55:21.963
I mean, I saw them!

55:23.565 --> 55:24.899
They recoiled!

55:24.966 --> 55:26.934
All right then! Answer this.

55:27.001 --> 55:29.804
Why aren't you afraid of him?

55:29.871 --> 55:32.574
ANGGEE:
When Shi-Sha broke my curse,

55:32.640 --> 55:34.277
even though he only half succeeded,

55:34.342 --> 55:37.579
and I continued to change
back and forth,

55:37.645 --> 55:40.283
I lost my vulnerability to mosquitos.

55:40.348 --> 55:43.186
But they were... No.

55:43.252 --> 55:46.088
Now who's a warrior without rival, huh?

55:46.155 --> 55:48.690
Great. Now he'll be insufferable.

55:48.756 --> 55:49.824
[distant clamoring]

55:49.891 --> 55:51.893
What's that?

55:53.561 --> 55:58.466
[Monkey shouting]

55:58.533 --> 56:02.770
[shouting continues]

56:13.348 --> 56:15.184
All of that is for us?

56:15.251 --> 56:17.186
What do we have to be worried about?

56:17.253 --> 56:21.056
After all, we have Mosquito on our side.

56:23.192 --> 56:25.960
Savva, trying to get through
that Monkey army

56:26.027 --> 56:28.630
without the Rickies is impossible.

56:28.696 --> 56:30.865
It's not too late to go back.

56:30.932 --> 56:33.202
He's right.
There's no shame in it, cher.

56:33.269 --> 56:36.904
No. My village is depending on me.

56:36.971 --> 56:39.307
And your people are depending on you.

56:39.374 --> 56:41.809
We'll get through.

56:41.876 --> 56:45.347
I believe it with all my heart.

56:50.452 --> 56:52.120
What are you doing?

56:52.187 --> 56:55.390
Sending a message to my grandpa.

56:55.457 --> 56:58.493
Do you want me to make
your sword strong?

56:58.560 --> 56:59.927
Can you do that?

56:59.994 --> 57:01.863
Simple magic.

57:15.543 --> 57:18.012
That's it.

57:18.080 --> 57:19.214
Amazing.

57:19.282 --> 57:22.016
- It looked so simple.
- It is.

57:22.084 --> 57:24.086
Practice six hours
every day of your life

57:24.152 --> 57:25.887
from the time you are three years old,

57:25.953 --> 57:28.990
and it becomes very simple.

57:29.057 --> 57:34.696
[tender music]

57:34.762 --> 57:39.334
SAVVA: Anggee, is it true
that the sun and the stars

57:39.401 --> 57:41.836
will go out one day?

57:41.903 --> 57:43.671
ANGGEE: Yes.

57:43.738 --> 57:45.473
SAVVA: But why?

57:45.540 --> 57:49.177
Because they are not eternal.

57:49.244 --> 57:52.046
What is eternal?

57:52.114 --> 57:53.515
Nothing.

57:53.581 --> 57:57.319
Nothing is eternal.

57:57.385 --> 58:00.455
What about God?

58:00.522 --> 58:03.858
God is, perhaps,
the only one who is eternal.

58:07.495 --> 58:09.131
What about the heart?

58:09.197 --> 58:13.468
No, the heart is not eternal.

58:18.273 --> 58:22.144
But doesn't God have a heart?

58:24.279 --> 58:25.880
Yes.

58:25.947 --> 58:28.216
Of course He does.

58:30.352 --> 58:35.022
His heart is eternal as God himself.

58:46.768 --> 58:49.337
Who's there? Show yourself.

58:49.404 --> 58:51.639
[footsteps]

58:51.706 --> 58:54.342
Grandpa! You got my message!

58:54.409 --> 58:57.679
Well, we will help you, darling.

58:57.745 --> 59:02.784
Thank you for coming, but we
are still vastly outnumbered.

59:02.850 --> 59:05.187
Angacetus.

59:08.823 --> 59:10.392
What are you doing here?

59:10.458 --> 59:13.128
I have a message from your father.

59:13.195 --> 59:16.131
Rickies will fight on your side.

59:16.198 --> 59:19.967
We will give you support.

59:21.403 --> 59:23.571
Be our leader.

59:29.677 --> 59:32.614
I smell Monkey barbecue.

59:35.817 --> 59:37.452
[chuckles]

59:37.519 --> 59:40.455
[clamoring]

59:45.127 --> 59:47.129
Why are we here?

59:47.195 --> 59:50.865
Are we having a giant picnic?

59:50.932 --> 59:52.567
Here they come.

59:52.634 --> 59:54.669
Here they come!

59:54.736 --> 59:58.606
[clamoring]

01:00:14.321 --> 01:00:16.258
You don't have to join us.

01:00:16.323 --> 01:00:20.995
Sure, I'll go sit over there
and watch like a girl.

01:00:25.167 --> 01:00:26.968
Hello, 911?

01:00:27.034 --> 01:00:28.335
[chuckles]

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.430
I'm sorry, old friend.
I need to wake you up.

01:01:05.507 --> 01:01:08.676
[roars]

01:01:10.078 --> 01:01:11.546
[distant roar]

01:01:11.613 --> 01:01:13.848
What is that noise?

01:01:13.915 --> 01:01:17.652
Oldi has woken up.

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:20.387
- What do you think?
- I don't. I'm dumb.

01:01:20.454 --> 01:01:23.525
Whee-ha!

01:01:23.591 --> 01:01:24.859
Ready?

01:01:24.926 --> 01:01:29.697
Come on, get over here! Hurry over here!

01:01:29.764 --> 01:01:31.599
Steady!

01:01:39.406 --> 01:01:40.708
Shoot!

01:01:44.679 --> 01:01:46.548
Shields up!

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:52.154
Can't hide from Terminator!

01:01:57.759 --> 01:01:59.094
Hold the line!

01:01:59.161 --> 01:02:02.064
Onward to the Monkeys!

01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.570
Where is the restroom here?
I'll be quick.

01:02:08.636 --> 01:02:10.738
Platoon, go!

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.676
March on, troops!

01:02:43.938 --> 01:02:45.372
No problem!

01:02:45.439 --> 01:02:48.110
We're shredding and smashing.

01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:50.411
Shredding and smashing.

01:03:08.596 --> 01:03:10.431
Thank you, kid.

01:03:20.007 --> 01:03:21.542
No more mercy!

01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:24.279
I've got a pink lightsaber!

01:03:39.426 --> 01:03:42.164
Gor, crush monkeys!

01:03:49.871 --> 01:03:52.074
What on earth is that?

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.676
An overgrown bat.

01:03:59.181 --> 01:04:00.514
Father!

01:04:00.581 --> 01:04:03.384
All of you cowards
against my Monkey people?

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:07.021
You'll have it the hard way then!

01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:09.957
You brought me the information.
Go and wake them.

01:04:10.024 --> 01:04:11.859
What if they won't come,
little bloodsuckers?

01:04:11.926 --> 01:04:15.562
They are living in a cave on my land.

01:04:15.629 --> 01:04:19.734
Tell them to come,
or I'll send the Exterminator!

01:04:37.685 --> 01:04:39.821
Mama Jozee needs your help!

01:04:39.887 --> 01:04:43.158
We are under attack by the Rickies!

01:04:43.225 --> 01:04:44.959
I get itchy from mosquito bites,

01:04:45.026 --> 01:04:48.063
but if they help us win the battle,
I guess it's okay.

01:04:48.130 --> 01:04:50.431
[buzzing]

01:04:57.772 --> 01:04:59.640
Death dealers!

01:04:59.707 --> 01:05:02.710
Do something!
You're the king, aren't you?

01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:05.612
I can't stop them! We have to agree!

01:05:05.679 --> 01:05:10.118
Agree with a mere insect?
I can not stop so low!

01:05:10.185 --> 01:05:12.254
Fafl! Semi-baron, look!

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.421
[buzzing]

01:05:14.488 --> 01:05:15.790
That doesn't look good.

01:05:18.359 --> 01:05:20.361
I'm their only hope!

01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:22.496
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:05:22.563 --> 01:05:24.465
I agree! You are the only hope!

01:05:24.531 --> 01:05:26.300
You are completely correct!

01:05:31.438 --> 01:05:34.276
Ah, that was humiliating.

01:05:34.341 --> 01:05:37.311
Okay, bug, show us what you got.

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:40.848
Fafl, you're an idiot!

01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:45.187
Stop!

01:05:45.253 --> 01:05:47.222
The king! It's the king!

01:05:47.289 --> 01:05:50.192
We will not bite a Rickie today!

01:05:50.258 --> 01:05:51.492
Not one!

01:05:51.558 --> 01:05:54.296
Our enemies today are the Monkeys!

01:05:54.361 --> 01:05:55.397
[buzzing]

01:05:55.463 --> 01:05:56.864
You parasites!

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.300
You traitors!

01:06:01.103 --> 01:06:05.173
[buzzing]

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.440
Help!

01:06:06.507 --> 01:06:08.243
Put me down!!

01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:09.343
[howling]

01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:12.413
Look, Ma, no hands!

01:06:12.479 --> 01:06:15.283
I spent three hours on this hairdo!

01:06:15.349 --> 01:06:16.683
This is terrible!

01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:20.922
Well, it certainly seems
as though this might be

01:06:20.988 --> 01:06:23.024
a propitious time to...

01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:24.591
I'm out.

01:06:24.658 --> 01:06:29.363
Perhaps it is a propitious
time to get lost.

01:06:48.382 --> 01:06:50.584
Well, is this it?

01:06:50.651 --> 01:06:52.820
Are we done?

01:06:52.887 --> 01:06:55.090
Yeah, this is it. Goodbye and good luck.

01:07:01.462 --> 01:07:04.331
You're a good man, Semi-baron Fafl.

01:07:04.398 --> 01:07:06.868
Hah! It shows what you know!

01:07:06.934 --> 01:07:08.203
I...

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.537
Oh. Uh, thank you.

01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:15.042
Hey, hey!

01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:22.349
I'm free! I'm free!

01:07:22.416 --> 01:07:24.451
I am so happy.

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:26.988
I never have to hear his voice.

01:07:27.055 --> 01:07:29.057
His stupid stories.

01:07:29.124 --> 01:07:31.226
You never have to smell him.

01:07:31.293 --> 01:07:32.393
Ah.

01:07:32.459 --> 01:07:34.595
Well, I'm free.

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.665
That was really nice of you.

01:07:38.732 --> 01:07:41.368
I have no idea what you mean.

01:07:41.435 --> 01:07:42.937
Okay, fine.

01:07:43.004 --> 01:07:44.605
Anggee, can you walk?

01:07:44.671 --> 01:07:47.142
- I'm fine.
- Then let's move.

01:07:47.209 --> 01:07:50.844
I want to get to the Magician
as soon as possible.

01:08:05.893 --> 01:08:09.897
What kind of magician
lives in a place like this?

01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:15.336
I know this house from old stories.

01:08:15.402 --> 01:08:17.871
It is the house of the Old Witch.

01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:23.544
House, turn your back to the forest,

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.912
your front to me.

01:08:27.848 --> 01:08:30.152
That's what you're supposed to say.

01:08:43.363 --> 01:08:44.398
- Oh!
- Relax.

01:08:44.465 --> 01:08:46.033
It's just a big fat turkey.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:58.212
Who is this Old Witch again?

01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:01.348
- She's a witch who...
- A witch who what?

01:09:01.415 --> 01:09:03.750
Who eats children.

01:09:03.817 --> 01:09:06.121
Of course she does.

01:09:17.497 --> 01:09:19.966
Well, that's a good sign.

01:09:22.703 --> 01:09:24.805
SAVVA: This place is creepy.

01:09:24.871 --> 01:09:27.608
Maybe no one's home.

01:09:29.643 --> 01:09:33.014
Me and my big mouth.

01:09:39.752 --> 01:09:41.089
It's an old shirt.

01:09:41.156 --> 01:09:45.093
You were expecting a magic cloak?

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.996
Honestly, we were expecting a witch.

01:09:49.064 --> 01:09:51.066
Oh, Old Witch.

01:09:51.133 --> 01:09:54.401
No, she hasn't lived
in this house for years.

01:09:54.468 --> 01:09:55.769
What happened to her?

01:09:55.836 --> 01:09:57.004
Let's just say...

01:09:57.072 --> 01:09:59.306
she tried to eat the wrong little girl.

01:09:59.373 --> 01:10:01.675
You're the Magician?

01:10:01.742 --> 01:10:02.876
Let me guess.

01:10:02.943 --> 01:10:05.512
Magicians have to be men and old.

01:10:05.579 --> 01:10:06.847
It's a rule.

01:10:06.913 --> 01:10:10.052
Ah, it's nice to see people again.

01:10:10.118 --> 01:10:11.153
You must want something.

01:10:11.219 --> 01:10:12.519
Go ahead, Savva.

01:10:12.586 --> 01:10:14.955
You know my name?

01:10:15.022 --> 01:10:16.423
Of course I do.

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:17.658
Now out with it.

01:10:17.724 --> 01:10:20.095
I was told that if I made my way to you,

01:10:20.162 --> 01:10:24.698
you might have a warrior here
who could save my village.

01:10:24.765 --> 01:10:26.733
He's right through that door.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.935
He's been waiting for you.

01:10:29.002 --> 01:10:30.937
Go ahead.

01:10:33.607 --> 01:10:35.676
Ah, Fafl.

01:10:35.742 --> 01:10:37.811
Remind me again why you were cursed?

01:10:37.878 --> 01:10:43.350
Uh, because of my pride and arrogance.

01:10:43.417 --> 01:10:44.918
You're kidding!

01:10:44.985 --> 01:10:47.921
Because I believed myself
superior to everyone else, okay?

01:10:47.988 --> 01:10:49.790
Where's the mosquito?

01:10:49.856 --> 01:10:52.127
Gone. He's free.

01:10:52.194 --> 01:10:53.195
We agreed.

01:10:54.961 --> 01:10:56.231
Kneel.

01:10:56.298 --> 01:11:02.204
With this magic wand, I dub thee
full-fledged Baron Fafl,

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:06.241
and I return you to your original state.

01:11:08.008 --> 01:11:13.347
Oh, it's me! I'm back!
I'm really back!

01:11:20.255 --> 01:11:21.289
Hello?

01:11:21.355 --> 01:11:23.857
Is anybody here?

01:11:28.895 --> 01:11:31.865
My name is Savva.
I think I'm looking for you.

01:11:34.368 --> 01:11:36.770
You certainly look powerful.

01:11:36.837 --> 01:11:38.273
Can you save my village?

01:11:40.607 --> 01:11:43.211
Why don't you answer me?

01:11:43.278 --> 01:11:47.881
What my father did was wrong,
but we've paid a heavy price.

01:11:47.948 --> 01:11:51.385
We've seen how dark our souls can be,

01:11:51.452 --> 01:11:53.255
and we're better for it.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.455
I agree.

01:11:54.521 --> 01:11:56.258
Then lift this curse.

01:11:56.323 --> 01:11:57.891
Transform, Anggee!

01:12:01.562 --> 01:12:03.664
The Rickies are no more.

01:12:05.599 --> 01:12:08.402
Nanty, what can I do for you?

01:12:08.469 --> 01:12:10.437
Nothing.

01:12:10.504 --> 01:12:13.141
I have everything I need.

01:12:13.208 --> 01:12:15.409
Are you sure?

01:12:15.476 --> 01:12:19.746
Thank you, but I'm sure.

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:20.981
Come on, we need to go.

01:12:21.047 --> 01:12:23.684
My village is waiting, my people are...

01:12:25.319 --> 01:12:26.320
What?

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:38.399
Really. I got nothing.

01:12:38.465 --> 01:12:41.935
Oh, I thought you were
an enchanted prince?

01:12:42.002 --> 01:12:44.605
Yeah, not so much.

01:12:44.671 --> 01:12:46.174
I wanted friends.

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:49.610
No more loneliness. I got them.

01:12:49.676 --> 01:12:51.011
You came all this way.

01:12:51.078 --> 01:12:53.447
There must be something
I can do for you.

01:12:59.886 --> 01:13:02.956
[chuckles]
Delightful!

01:13:06.427 --> 01:13:08.695
Did you find what you were looking for?

01:13:08.762 --> 01:13:11.233
Yes, thank you.

01:13:13.534 --> 01:13:15.536
Door, please.

01:13:15.602 --> 01:13:17.571
Puzhalsta!

01:13:17.638 --> 01:13:19.340
Ah...

01:13:37.158 --> 01:13:38.125
Wow.

01:13:38.192 --> 01:13:39.560
You, uh...

01:13:39.626 --> 01:13:41.895
You really are... handsome.

01:13:41.962 --> 01:13:48.270
Well, you know,
maybe slightly above average.

01:14:01.582 --> 01:14:04.017
You are our leader now.

01:14:10.191 --> 01:14:13.360
Listen, I can make you rich!

01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:19.333
I can make you the dragon in
charge of all the other dragons!

01:14:21.568 --> 01:14:23.271
I accept.

01:14:23.337 --> 01:14:25.372
[howling]

01:14:25.439 --> 01:14:27.374
Anggee, my village.

01:14:27.441 --> 01:14:29.843
Climb on.
We'll get you there in no time.

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:32.079
Ah, well, thank you!

01:14:32.146 --> 01:14:34.948
This is very nice of you,
very nice indeed,

01:14:35.015 --> 01:14:39.287
because I am no better than you at all!

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.316
GIRL: Is that Savva?

01:15:09.383 --> 01:15:11.552
BOY: They're so gonna eat him.

01:15:12.819 --> 01:15:14.421
Savva!

01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:15.556
It's okay, Mom.

01:15:15.622 --> 01:15:17.458
What are you doing?

01:15:17.524 --> 01:15:19.826
Saving the world entire.

01:15:22.563 --> 01:15:25.266
Wait.

01:15:25.332 --> 01:15:28.502
It's between the two of us.

01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:30.904
[snickering]

01:15:30.971 --> 01:15:32.173
Well, well.

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:34.608
You can't beat me, sweetie.

01:15:47.788 --> 01:15:49.990
Is that all you've got?

01:15:56.663 --> 01:15:57.864
Bad dog!

01:16:21.522 --> 01:16:24.425
We are not your slaves!

01:16:34.668 --> 01:16:36.270
Please.

01:16:36.336 --> 01:16:38.672
Spare me.

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.645
[hyena whimpers]

01:16:44.711 --> 01:16:46.180
[gasps]

01:16:50.851 --> 01:16:53.220
Never come back here again!

01:16:58.592 --> 01:17:00.961
Yeah! You better run!

01:17:01.027 --> 01:17:02.229
[snorts]

01:17:02.296 --> 01:17:04.298
- Oh!
- [hyenas laughing]

01:17:17.343 --> 01:17:18.645
Savva!

01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:24.785
I saw him first!

01:17:24.851 --> 01:17:26.087
He's mine. Back off!

01:17:28.855 --> 01:17:30.724
[screaming]

01:17:38.832 --> 01:17:40.134
So, here you are,

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:43.637
tell me, what did you finally
ask the Magician for?

01:17:43.704 --> 01:17:46.306
Uh...

01:17:46.372 --> 01:17:47.674
[hums]

01:17:47.741 --> 01:17:49.843
[crowd clamoring]

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:51.978
Makatunga!

01:17:52.045 --> 01:17:54.047
Makatunga!

01:17:54.115 --> 01:17:59.186
[cheering]

01:17:59.253 --> 01:18:01.988
Put me down this instant!
That's an order!

01:18:02.056 --> 01:18:04.858
There's gonna be dancing!

01:18:04.925 --> 01:18:10.297
[cheering continues]

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.468
All your dreams have come true.

01:18:15.536 --> 01:18:19.073
You've achieved what you wanted
all by yourself.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:20.541
Now I must go.

01:18:20.607 --> 01:18:24.078
I must hurry and catch up
with the others,

01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:27.447
for I am their leader.

01:18:48.802 --> 01:18:50.436
I'll miss him so much.

01:18:50.503 --> 01:18:52.438
We'll see him again, cher.

01:18:52.806 --> 01:18:59.045
* I saw a magical dream *

01:18:59.113 --> 01:19:08.189
* I had a vision *

01:19:08.255 --> 01:19:09.556
What a surprise!

01:19:09.623 --> 01:19:12.025
What will you do
now that your curse is lifted?

01:19:12.093 --> 01:19:13.994
I thought I would head north.

01:19:14.061 --> 01:19:17.264
I've gotten quite used
to roaming these last few years.

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.865
I could head north.

01:19:18.932 --> 01:19:20.801
Oh, inviting yourself, are you?

01:19:20.867 --> 01:19:23.704
I'm not going to wait
for you to invite me.

01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:25.338
I'll be old and pink.

01:19:25.405 --> 01:19:26.840
Do I look like the kind of man

01:19:26.907 --> 01:19:30.711
who wants to travel
with an oversized cotton swab?

01:19:30.777 --> 01:19:32.813
I'm the one who has to put up
with your stories

01:19:32.879 --> 01:19:36.416
about women fighting over you
all the time.

01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:38.752
They were fighting over me
six minutes ago!

01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:41.588
What a surprise! They fought the duels

01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:46.260
with nothing but chewing gum
and paper clips!

01:19:46.326 --> 01:19:48.028
I suppose you could come in handy

01:19:48.095 --> 01:19:49.663
if I have to clean my ears.

01:19:55.001 --> 01:19:57.804
Why are you so sad, Savva?

01:19:57.871 --> 01:19:59.539
I don't know.

01:19:59.606 --> 01:20:03.077
It's the first time
I found a true friend.

01:20:03.144 --> 01:20:06.280
He is not leaving, cher.

01:20:06.346 --> 01:20:08.882
I'm gonna miss him anyway.

01:20:10.217 --> 01:20:11.618
[distant howling]

01:20:11.685 --> 01:20:15.989
* I believe *

01:20:29.602 --> 01:20:35.876
* I hold your hand to my heart *

01:20:35.942 --> 01:20:44.285
* There's no more fear *

01:20:45.819 --> 01:20:51.758
* I feel so strong in my soul *

01:20:51.825 --> 01:20:59.465
* I want to share it *

01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:04.537
* Now I know what it's like *

01:21:04.604 --> 01:21:11.444
* Wish with all my heart *

01:21:15.381 --> 01:21:18.152
* I believe *

01:21:18.219 --> 01:21:22.089
* The love I feel inside *

01:21:22.156 --> 01:21:25.859
* In truth I want to find *

01:21:25.926 --> 01:21:31.265
* The guidance in my heart *

01:21:31.331 --> 01:21:33.834
* I believe *

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.704
* You're here with me to stay *

01:21:37.771 --> 01:21:41.674
* And all I have to say *

01:21:41.742 --> 01:21:46.880
* Forever I'm your friend *

01:21:51.718 --> 01:21:54.454
* I believe *

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:58.424
* The love I feel inside *

01:21:58.491 --> 01:22:02.196
* In truth I want to find *

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:07.400
* The guidance in my heart *

01:22:07.467 --> 01:22:10.071
* I believe *

01:22:10.137 --> 01:22:14.340
* You're here with me to stay *

01:22:14.407 --> 01:22:16.676
Hey, fellas!

01:22:16.743 --> 01:22:19.980
Fafl, is that what
those women fought for?

01:22:23.483 --> 01:22:26.253
Found a nice country girl for myself.

01:22:26.319 --> 01:22:27.954
Bit of a junk-food addict,

01:22:28.021 --> 01:22:30.556
but she sure knows what a man wants.

01:22:30.623 --> 01:22:34.327
Told her you'd be
the best ride for our honeymoon.

01:22:34.394 --> 01:22:37.931
Hey, pal, I called shotgun first.

01:22:48.209 --> 01:22:50.443
I'm loving it!
