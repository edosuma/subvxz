about his personal life?

No, he kept to himself.

13:41.281 --> 13:43.150

I think I've ever met.

He could hardly look a woman
in the eye.

kept it like this.

He was very exact.

Nothing personal.

14:18.418 --> 14:20.120
What was his job here?

14:20.153 --> 14:22.422
Mr. Farthingale was in
tax evasion.

14:22.455 --> 14:24.391
He'd go after people
who didn't pay their taxes?

14:24.424 --> 14:25.592
Go after? No.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.260
We have field agents for that.

would scan and collate records,

non-taxpaying citizens,

14:31.631 --> 14:33.566

for the field agents.

He never left his cubicle?

He seemed to like it that way.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.281
Well, we'll need a list
of the people

14:38.305 --> 14:40.240

as tax evaders.

killed Mr. Farthingale.

Impossible for one of them
to even know who he was.

The D.A.'s office told me.

22:35.283 --> 22:36.952
They told you
because you're my lawyer?

22:36.985 --> 22:39.020
I'm not your lawyer
anymore, Charlie.

22:39.054 --> 22:41.923
I know.
I know what we said, but...

22:41.957 --> 22:43.992
I.A.D. told me
to get a lawyer.

22:44.025 --> 22:46.227
Who else am I gonna trust
on this, Connie?

22:46.261 --> 22:47.362
[Clears throat]

22:47.395 --> 22:50.098
The D.A.'s office
called me last week.

22:50.131 --> 22:52.133
But Ames died yesterday.

22:53.751 --> 22:55.586
They called me about a job.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.422
You?

22:57.455 --> 22:58.455
Working for the D.A.?

23:00.458 --> 23:01.326
I took it.

23:01.359 --> 23:03.128
[Exhales]

23:03.161 --> 23:04.996
Well, they've been after you
for years.

23:05.030 --> 23:06.097
Why now?

23:06.131 --> 23:07.132
Because.

23:07.165 --> 23:08.266
The Cudahy thing got to me.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.635
Because most of my clients
aren't like you, Charlie.

23:10.668 --> 23:12.403
Most of my clients,
the high-priced ones

23:12.437 --> 23:15.006
the firm assigned me,
they're guilty.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.341
How does your husband feel

23:16.374 --> 23:18.676
about coming back
from New York early?

23:18.709 --> 23:21.546
My husband is gonna
stay there for a while.

23:21.579 --> 23:23.148
He needs it.

23:23.181 --> 23:24.449
We both need it.

23:24.482 --> 23:26.317
Why are you here, Connie?

23:26.351 --> 23:29.320
Because I start with
the D.A.'s office tomorrow.

23:29.354 --> 23:32.123
And the next time I see you,

23:32.157 --> 23:35.493
it'll be on
official business, so...

23:35.526 --> 23:37.662
I need you to listen
to me, Charlie.

23:37.695 --> 23:40.031
Okay?

23:40.065 --> 23:44.469
The D.A.'s office wants you
really bad for Ames' death.

23:44.502 --> 23:46.771
And you just--
you need to watch yourself.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.276
And you really should
lock your door.

23:58.616 --> 24:01.119
What'd she mean,

24:01.152 --> 24:02.487
you need to watch yourself?

24:02.520 --> 24:06.691
A week before Ames died,

24:06.724 --> 24:09.527
the D.A. took my lawyer
from me.

24:12.463 --> 24:15.666
Initial Internal Affairs inquiry

24:15.700 --> 24:18.203
with Charles Crews,
detective, LAPD.

24:18.236 --> 24:20.071
Detective Crews,

24:20.105 --> 24:22.240
what were your feelings
towards Carl Ames?

24:22.273 --> 24:24.175
My feelings toward Ames
were the same

24:24.209 --> 24:25.410
as my feelings toward anyone.

24:25.443 --> 24:26.744
And those would be?

24:26.777 --> 24:28.513
That none of us are alone.

24:28.546 --> 24:31.682
That even as we exhale,
it is inhaled by others.

24:31.716 --> 24:34.252
Is that some kind of joke?

24:34.285 --> 24:37.422
Well, laughter
is the best medicine.

24:39.690 --> 24:42.293
Reader's Digest.

24:42.327 --> 24:44.595
I had a subscription
at Pelican Bay.

24:44.629 --> 24:46.464
Detective Crews,

24:46.497 --> 24:48.399
you were seen arguing
in a bar with Ames.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.368
Would that be connected
to his death?

24:50.401 --> 24:52.170
The light that shines upon me

24:52.203 --> 24:53.571
shines upon my neighbor as well.

24:53.604 --> 24:55.540
What is that supposed to mean?

24:55.573 --> 24:59.410
That in this way,
everything is connected

24:59.444 --> 25:01.379
to everything else.

25:06.317 --> 25:09.787
[Muffled shouting]

25:12.423 --> 25:15.092
Who did he piss off
to get himself killed like that?

25:16.527 --> 25:17.628
Farthingale.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.364
Someone rigged his stove.

25:19.397 --> 25:21.132
Someone wanted him dead bad.

25:21.166 --> 25:23.234
Someone's still out there.

25:23.268 --> 25:25.903
You still got your head
in the Farthingale case?

25:25.936 --> 25:27.238
I do.

25:27.272 --> 25:29.307
Okay.

25:29.340 --> 25:31.442
So, what's your head thinking?

25:31.476 --> 25:34.279
My head is thinking
that we need to know more

25:34.312 --> 25:36.247
about what Farthingale's head
was thinking.

25:36.281 --> 25:37.248
But how do we do that?

25:37.282 --> 25:38.283
No one knew him.

25:38.316 --> 25:39.884
It was just Farthing and Gale.

25:39.917 --> 25:42.153
Farthingale split himself
in two.

25:42.187 --> 25:44.121
Let's put him back together.

25:46.257 --> 25:47.692
We know his wives didn't do it.

25:47.725 --> 25:50.428
Maybe they could tell us
who did.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.563
Okay, so...
What are we looking for?

25:52.597 --> 25:54.365
The points of connection.

25:54.399 --> 25:56.567
And what would those look like?

25:56.601 --> 25:58.369
Gale was here,

25:58.403 --> 25:59.270
Farthing was there.

25:59.304 --> 26:01.272
But Farthingale was also
in both places.

26:01.306 --> 26:02.473
We need to find Farthingale.

26:02.507 --> 26:03.508
So we're not looking

26:03.541 --> 26:04.775
for how they were different.

26:04.809 --> 26:06.411
We're looking
for how they were the same.

26:06.444 --> 26:09.547
We find that,
we find Farthingale.

26:09.580 --> 26:11.416
What kind of music
did Joseph listen to?

26:11.449 --> 26:13.284
Modern jazz.

26:13.318 --> 26:15.520
What kind of music
did Edward like?

26:15.553 --> 26:16.654
Classic rock.

26:16.687 --> 26:18.923
What kind of TV did he watch?

26:18.956 --> 26:20.391
Sports mostly.

26:20.425 --> 26:22.760
Oh, Joseph never watched TV.

26:23.828 --> 26:25.296
Scrambled.

26:25.330 --> 26:26.464
Poached.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.499
Flat.
Sparkling.

26:28.533 --> 26:29.767
Top.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.669
Bottom.

26:31.702 --> 26:33.438
Boxers.
Briefs.

26:33.471 --> 26:34.439
Right side of the bed.

26:34.472 --> 26:35.573
Left side of the bed.

26:35.606 --> 26:37.408
But he was a light sleeper.

26:37.442 --> 26:38.523
But he was a light sleeper.

26:40.478 --> 26:43.414
And what did he used to do
when he couldn't sleep?

26:43.448 --> 26:45.216
He would sit in that chair.

26:45.250 --> 26:47.552
Just sit there and stare.

26:47.585 --> 26:48.786
Almost meditating.

26:48.819 --> 26:50.255
Which chair would he sit in?

26:50.288 --> 26:51.356
That one.

26:51.389 --> 26:52.723
He'd just sit and stare.

26:52.757 --> 26:54.459
Totally zoning out.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.310
What do you see?

27:12.343 --> 27:13.278
Um...

27:13.311 --> 27:14.745
A fireplace.

27:14.779 --> 27:16.347
What else do you see?

27:16.381 --> 27:17.882
Um...

27:17.915 --> 27:21.519
A picture of Farthingale
and Elena.

27:25.790 --> 27:27.625
A model boat.

27:29.427 --> 27:31.028
Uh...

27:31.061 --> 27:32.830
A duck decoy.

27:32.863 --> 27:36.033
A fishing pole.
Um...

27:36.066 --> 27:38.636
Five baseball caps.

27:39.870 --> 27:42.039
Crews:
How many?
How many caps?

27:42.072 --> 27:43.874
Five. Why?

27:43.908 --> 27:45.543
What do you see?

27:47.312 --> 27:49.414
Five bottles of wine.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.521
Anything?

27:58.689 --> 28:00.658
[Sighs]

28:00.691 --> 28:02.627
Reese:
You got two national pastimes.

28:02.660 --> 28:04.795
Baseball and drinking.

28:04.829 --> 28:06.797
Hmm.

28:06.831 --> 28:10.401
This is what he liked to do
when he couldn't sleep.

28:10.435 --> 28:12.337
When you can't sleep,
what do you think about?

28:12.370 --> 28:14.839
I don't have a problem sleeping.

28:14.872 --> 28:16.407
Work.

28:16.441 --> 28:18.409
When I can't sleep,
I think about work.

28:18.443 --> 28:21.011
He worked
for the I.R.S.

28:21.045 --> 28:23.381
Farthingale
worked for the I.R.S.

28:23.414 --> 28:26.751
Farthing and Gale were spies.

28:26.784 --> 28:29.920
And they would sit here
and meditate on these objects.

28:29.954 --> 28:31.722
All right.

28:31.756 --> 28:34.559
Five baseball caps
from minor league teams.

28:34.592 --> 28:36.727
And five bottles of wine.

28:36.761 --> 28:38.095
This is ridiculous.

28:38.128 --> 28:40.331
This is what he did.

28:46.103 --> 28:48.072
You see something, don't you?

28:48.105 --> 28:50.307
No, it's ridiculous.

28:52.710 --> 28:55.413
What are the years
on those bottles?

28:55.446 --> 28:57.081
Um...

28:57.114 --> 28:58.916
'93, '97,

28:58.949 --> 29:01.486
'99, 2002, and 2004.

29:01.519 --> 29:03.388
That's really odd.

29:03.421 --> 29:04.455
1993...

29:06.391 --> 29:08.659
Bakersfield Post Office.

29:08.693 --> 29:12.129
1997...
Lancaster Police Station.

29:12.162 --> 29:14.565
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, 1999...

29:14.599 --> 29:16.467
Modesto--

29:16.501 --> 29:17.635
Courthouse.
Courthouse.

29:17.668 --> 29:18.736
2002,

29:18.769 --> 29:20.070
Stockton Hall of Records.

29:20.104 --> 29:21.406
2004--

29:21.439 --> 29:23.541
Both: Visalia City Hall.

29:23.574 --> 29:24.675
Those are the years

29:24.709 --> 29:25.810
these places were bombed.

29:25.843 --> 29:27.545
Free State bombings.

29:27.578 --> 29:28.746
Free State bombings?

29:28.779 --> 29:29.823
Reese: Oh, you have been away.

29:29.847 --> 29:31.449
Free State.
He's a--

29:31.482 --> 29:33.418
he's an antigovernment
whack job.

29:33.451 --> 29:34.752
He calls himself Free State.

29:34.785 --> 29:36.153
Pulls a bombing every few years

29:36.186 --> 29:37.822
and then he goes back
into hiding.

29:37.855 --> 29:38.989
Never been caught.

29:39.023 --> 29:40.558
Until now.

29:40.591 --> 29:41.959
You think this I.R.S. clerk,

29:41.992 --> 29:43.628
Rudolph Farthingale,
did what hundreds

29:43.661 --> 29:45.596
of federal agents
have failed to do?

29:45.630 --> 29:48.032
Free State was a bomber.

29:48.065 --> 29:50.100
Someone blew up
Farthingale's stove.

30:00.975 --> 30:02.409
Let me have those years, please.

30:02.443 --> 30:04.812
1993, '97,

30:04.846 --> 30:06.213
'99,

30:06.247 --> 30:09.183
2002, and 2004.

30:09.216 --> 30:11.218
Nothing.

30:11.252 --> 30:13.087
There's no entry in
Mr. Farthingale's

30:13.120 --> 30:15.256
tax evasion files that have
those dates as a key.

30:15.289 --> 30:16.557
What did the wives say?

30:16.590 --> 30:19.393
He was not looking for someone
not obeying the law?

30:19.426 --> 30:22.463
He was looking for the guy
not not obeying the law.

30:22.496 --> 30:26.200
He was not looking for the guy
not obeying the law.

30:26.233 --> 30:27.601
Will he...
Just keep saying that?

30:27.634 --> 30:29.370
Not not obeying the law.

30:31.973 --> 30:34.341
Was Farthingale tracking someone
who was paying their taxes?

30:34.375 --> 30:35.609
Well, I can't imagine why

30:35.642 --> 30:37.945
he would track someone
who was paying his taxes.

30:37.979 --> 30:40.414
Could you check anyway for me?

30:40.447 --> 30:44.085
He was not not obeying the law.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.520
He was not not paying his taxes.

30:46.553 --> 30:48.522
Free State lives off the grid,

30:48.555 --> 30:50.257
but he comes back on
every few years.

30:50.291 --> 30:52.526
Pays taxes when he needs
to earn money,

30:52.559 --> 30:54.161
rent cars, buy supplies.

30:54.195 --> 30:56.530
Nothing.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.133
But if you wanted
to establish credit

30:59.166 --> 31:00.610
in a certain year,
you'd have to file taxes

31:00.634 --> 31:01.602
the year before.

31:01.635 --> 31:03.237
So we should check

31:03.270 --> 31:04.972
one year before each attack.

31:05.006 --> 31:07.541
'92, '96, '98,

31:07.574 --> 31:09.476
'01, '03.

31:12.146 --> 31:13.147
Ms. Watkins:
Ah.

31:13.180 --> 31:14.315
Leonard Slatz.

31:14.348 --> 31:17.018
Mr. Slatz is not
a tax evader.

31:17.051 --> 31:18.452
I mean, not consistently so.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.454
He won't pay taxes
for a few years,

31:20.487 --> 31:21.455
and then he'll file,

31:21.488 --> 31:25.492
and then he won't pay again.

31:25.526 --> 31:26.894
That's why he wasn't listed

31:26.928 --> 31:29.130
in Mr. Farthingale's
evasion file.

31:29.163 --> 31:31.098
He was not not paying.

31:31.132 --> 31:33.400
How would Farthingale get hold
of something like this?

31:33.434 --> 31:34.668
Oh, you would have to look

31:34.701 --> 31:37.571
for some kind
of a statistical anomaly

31:37.604 --> 31:40.074
or something that didn't belong

31:40.107 --> 31:43.677
in the tax database,
but the patience to do that,

31:43.710 --> 31:45.679
it's thousands of hours.

31:45.712 --> 31:47.248
Did Slatz pay his taxes
last year?

31:47.281 --> 31:48.582
Yes, he did.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.384
He's preparing
for another attack.

31:50.417 --> 31:53.020
Do you have an address
listed for Mr. Leonard Slatz?

31:53.054 --> 31:55.389
Yes, but it's a Post Office box.

32:00.394 --> 32:02.463
Okay.

32:02.496 --> 32:04.231
P.O. Box was emptied out
two days ago.

32:04.265 --> 32:06.433
Some creepy guy rolls up
in an R.V.,

32:06.467 --> 32:07.668
closes out the account,

32:07.701 --> 32:09.203
no forwarding address.

32:09.236 --> 32:10.938
Farthingale got close.
[Phone rings]

32:10.972 --> 32:11.939
Hello.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.474
Charlie.

32:13.507 --> 32:14.517
Hey, how was your first day
as a D.A.?

32:14.541 --> 32:15.442
Go home.

32:15.476 --> 32:16.443
What?

32:16.477 --> 32:18.145
Go home, Charlie.

32:18.179 --> 32:20.114
Go home now.

32:30.191 --> 32:31.358
Hey!

32:31.392 --> 32:33.527
It's kind of like a party,
except, uh,

32:33.560 --> 32:34.671
this is my house,
and I don't remember

32:34.695 --> 32:35.762
sending out the invites.

32:35.796 --> 32:38.165
Detective Crews, in that you're
a person of interest

32:38.199 --> 32:39.333
in the killing of Carl Ames,

32:39.366 --> 32:42.003
the District Attorney's office
has issued a search warrant

32:42.036 --> 32:44.438
for these premises, as well as
the occupants therein.

32:44.471 --> 32:45.648
Don't you wish
you could talk that way?

32:45.672 --> 32:48.009
They seem pretty serious,
Charlie.

32:48.042 --> 32:49.410
We are serious, detective,

32:49.443 --> 32:50.723
so let's just get this
over with.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.420
Hey!

32:59.453 --> 33:00.621
Hey!

33:14.435 --> 33:15.702
It's locked.

33:15.736 --> 33:17.004
Is it?

33:17.038 --> 33:18.272
Do you have a key?

33:18.305 --> 33:20.274
I had a key.

33:20.307 --> 33:21.275
Do you know where it is?

33:21.308 --> 33:23.010
Do you know what happened?

33:23.044 --> 33:24.378
I left the key in there.

33:24.411 --> 33:25.479
Then I locked the door

33:25.512 --> 33:27.481
with the key inside, so.

33:27.514 --> 33:28.525
In order to unlock the door,
I need to get the key,

33:28.549 --> 33:30.651
but I can't get the key
unless I unlock the door.

33:30.684 --> 33:32.519
It's a, it's a--
it's a puzzle.

33:32.553 --> 33:33.554
It's...

33:33.587 --> 33:35.522

33:58.645 --> 34:00.414
Let's go.

34:21.468 --> 34:22.569
You took it all?

34:22.603 --> 34:26.039
I was looking for porn.

34:27.441 --> 34:28.442
[Exhales]

34:28.475 --> 34:29.510
Your lawyer called.

34:29.543 --> 34:32.413
Said the cops were coming
to serve a search warrant.

34:32.446 --> 34:34.848
If there was anything
you wouldn't want found...

34:34.881 --> 34:36.450
How did you get in the door?

34:38.585 --> 34:40.087
Charlie, you weren't
the only one

34:40.121 --> 34:41.422
to spend time in prison.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.390
I learned some things
in there too.

34:43.424 --> 34:45.459
How did you know
what was in there?

34:45.492 --> 34:48.395
I didn't exactly.

34:48.429 --> 34:51.232
But something else I learned
in prison, Charlie.

34:51.265 --> 34:53.767
You had to have something
hidden away.

35:15.256 --> 35:17.258
Okay, Farthingale.
Let's get to work.

35:49.189 --> 35:51.291
Crews?

35:51.324 --> 35:52.793
Are you okay?

35:56.096 --> 35:57.306
The feds are gonna try
to figure out

35:57.330 --> 35:58.999
where Free State is going next.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.433
But Edward Farthing
and Joseph Gale

36:00.466 --> 36:01.768
already knew that.

36:01.802 --> 36:03.369
They followed him.
They got too close.

36:03.403 --> 36:04.905
And that's what got 'em killed.

36:04.938 --> 36:05.772
No. No.

36:05.806 --> 36:08.308
Crews, that's what got
him killed.

36:08.341 --> 36:09.843
There was no Farthing.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.377
There was no Gale.

36:11.411 --> 36:13.513
It was just one man.
Farthingale.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.850
One person split in two.

36:16.883 --> 36:20.053
Both needing the same thing.

36:20.086 --> 36:21.387
Both needing to be a hero.

36:21.421 --> 36:24.090
Both needing to find Slatz.

36:24.124 --> 36:26.092
And both...

36:26.126 --> 36:27.527
Both an I.R.S. agent.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.230
Both Farthing and Gale

36:30.263 --> 36:31.998
saved all their receipts.

36:32.032 --> 36:35.501
So you find a place
where Farthing and Gale

36:35.535 --> 36:36.502
both went.

36:36.536 --> 36:39.005
"You are what you receipt."

36:41.875 --> 36:43.443
Both Farthing and Gale

36:43.476 --> 36:47.313
ate over and over at this place.

36:47.347 --> 36:50.016
We wanna find Slatz,
we follow Farthing and Gale.

36:51.051 --> 36:53.086

36:53.419 --> 36:55.464
Yeah, I can't seeintellectual Farthing
or health nut Gale

36:55.521 --> 36:57.290
eating at Dandy's Fast Foods

36:57.323 --> 36:58.624
for the food.

36:58.658 --> 37:00.226
So let's go see why they--

37:00.260 --> 37:02.728
why he went there.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.540
Well, we have one thing
Farthingale didn't have

37:04.564 --> 37:05.831
when he went after Slatz.

Yeah, what's that?

box place say?

37:18.411 --> 37:20.446
Some guy closed out
the account yesterday.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.582
And what was he driving?

37:24.684 --> 37:27.453
An R.V.

37:29.755 --> 37:31.357

37:31.391 --> 37:33.393
We're detectives
Reese and Crews.

We're looking for--

37:34.460 --> 37:35.661
Leonard Slatz.

37:35.695 --> 37:37.430
That's right.
Figures.

37:37.463 --> 37:39.165
Yeah? Why's that?

37:39.199 --> 37:40.776

was always going off

a matter of time

37:44.337 --> 37:45.647

to take him away.

37:45.671 --> 37:46.839
Is he here?
Nope.

37:46.872 --> 37:47.873
Took off two days ago.

37:47.907 --> 37:48.907

37:48.908 --> 37:51.211
and a month of unpaid rent
and utility fees.

37:51.244 --> 37:52.778
He did leave a few boxes behind.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.314
You want me to go get 'em?

37:54.347 --> 37:55.415
Uh, no.

37:55.448 --> 37:56.048
No, I think it'd be better

37:56.081 --> 37:57.383
if you let us go get 'em.

37:57.417 --> 37:59.285
Suit yourself.

38:33.419 --> 38:34.659
I think I'm gonna back away now.

38:34.687 --> 38:37.423
Yeah, I think
that'd be a good idea.

an unjust government?

39:01.013 --> 39:03.316
For asserting my naturally given
free will?

39:03.349 --> 39:05.585
No, you're under arrest
for the murder

39:05.618 --> 39:07.720

was half physical,
half intellectual.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.440
And Farthing and Gale,
the field agent, the analyst.
