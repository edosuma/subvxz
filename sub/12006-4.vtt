00:00.285 --> 00:01.863
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...

00:02.098 --> 00:03.065
Hi.

00:03.099 --> 00:05.134
Ty said "I love you"

00:05.168 --> 00:07.036
and I didn't say "I love you" back.

00:07.070 --> 00:09.205
- Is that why he cheated?
- You're gonna be okay.

00:09.239 --> 00:12.341
I'm here for community service.
I'm supposed to ask for Jorge.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.411
I'll be your direct supervisor. Pretty
much the general guy in charge here.

00:15.445 --> 00:18.280
- I'm Campbell.
- You're a volunteer too?

00:18.315 --> 00:21.283
Are you asking, am I a
convicted felon like you?

00:21.318 --> 00:24.186
- Sounds like you looked me up.
- I want to buy K&D.

00:24.221 --> 00:26.355
I cannot think of a
better investment than you.

00:26.389 --> 00:28.491
I just got out of a meeting with
the builder for the restaurant.

00:28.525 --> 00:31.260
- It will be another 350k each.
- Are you kidding?!

00:31.294 --> 00:34.029
I'm smart, I pay well and
I know talent when I see it.

00:34.064 --> 00:35.264
I'd like to find something
for you to work on.

00:35.298 --> 00:38.167
I did see a trailer for this
snowboarding documentary.

00:38.201 --> 00:39.468
We should totally go
see it when it comes out.

00:39.503 --> 00:41.203
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

00:41.238 --> 00:43.239
- What's going on?
- Not much. How are you doing?

00:51.248 --> 00:54.149
Are we bad people for not carpooling?

00:54.184 --> 00:56.151
Oh, I have the clinic after school.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.120
Ooh, community service.

00:58.154 --> 01:00.356
At least one of us is righting the scales.

01:00.390 --> 01:02.258
I wish I didn't have to go.

01:02.292 --> 01:06.095
- That bad, huh?
- I mean, the job's fine.

01:06.129 --> 01:08.030
It's just some of the people...

01:09.199 --> 01:11.033
Campbell's working today.

01:11.067 --> 01:13.102
Ah, Mr. Hot Wheels.

01:13.136 --> 01:15.304
I'm trying so hard not to like him,

01:15.338 --> 01:17.273
but he is smart,

01:17.307 --> 01:21.176
and cool and he has the
most amazing eyelashes...

01:21.211 --> 01:24.146
- Ever.
- Sounds like a complete loser.

01:24.180 --> 01:26.348
He has a girlfriend.

01:26.428 --> 01:29.096
Wow. Did not see that one coming.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.333
Well, as someone who has
been cheated on twice...

01:32.367 --> 01:35.102
maybe three times...

01:35.136 --> 01:36.537
I support your decision.

01:37.572 --> 01:39.406
I just wish he wasn't so hot.

01:42.410 --> 01:45.279
Resist. You'll only get burned.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.514
Resist the hotness? Right.

01:47.549 --> 01:48.549
Oh.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.455
Hey.

01:56.424 --> 01:58.092
What's their problem?

01:58.093 --> 02:04.195
____

02:04.466 --> 02:06.166
That's crazy!

02:06.201 --> 02:08.134
They should be mad at him, not you.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.370
You did the right thing.

02:09.371 --> 02:10.886
____

02:11.139 --> 02:13.107
I don't want you to think I said that

02:13.141 --> 02:15.442
just so I could ask you a favor, but...

02:16.043 --> 02:16.734
____

02:17.145 --> 02:19.346
Okay, so I'm putting together my portfolio

02:19.381 --> 02:21.315
for art school applications,

02:21.349 --> 02:23.484
and I really need pictures of my work.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.152
I could use your help.

02:25.153 --> 02:28.618
____

02:28.619 --> 02:34.350
____

02:34.362 --> 02:37.264
Astronomy, me? You sure you want my help?

02:37.265 --> 02:42.395
____

02:42.404 --> 02:45.072
Like a moon... like falling stars...

02:45.106 --> 02:47.074
Oh, like the lunar meteor shower thing!

02:47.075 --> 02:53.405
____

02:53.414 --> 02:56.150
I don't know, sounds pretty nerdy.

02:56.184 --> 03:02.156
Plus you know that I don't speak Klingon?

03:02.190 --> 03:03.457
Sure, yeah, I'll go.

03:15.203 --> 03:16.437
No, everything's fine.

- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:31.453 --> 03:33.187
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

03:33.221 --> 03:35.189
Okay, I could use an honest opinion.

03:35.223 --> 03:37.524
Does this say professional,
without looking uptight?

03:37.559 --> 03:40.294
It says professional and stylish.

03:40.328 --> 03:42.329
- What's the occasion?
- Oh, new client.

03:42.363 --> 03:44.064
He's very demanding.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.200
And very impressive. Oh here, let me help.

03:46.234 --> 03:48.235
Well, you know what?

03:48.269 --> 03:50.237
You are very impressive too.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.140
He was a multi-millionaire
by the time he was 27.

03:53.174 --> 03:55.509
He owns his own jet.

03:55.543 --> 03:58.078
He could work with anybody that he wants,

03:58.113 --> 03:59.446
but he's taking a chance on me...

03:59.481 --> 04:02.116
despite my best efforts to blow it up.

04:02.150 --> 04:03.417
So you're playing hard to get?

04:05.220 --> 04:07.421
Well, obviously he thinks you're talented.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.324
Yeah, but am I talented enough?

04:10.358 --> 04:12.259
I really need the business.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.294
If it doesn't work out,
it's only one client.

04:14.329 --> 04:16.262
It's not like all your
eggs are in one basket.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.232
Eggs! I'd love some.

04:18.266 --> 04:20.267
On that note, I'm off to finish a freebie

04:20.301 --> 04:22.402
in East Riverside. See you.

04:22.437 --> 04:24.338
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:24.372 --> 04:26.373
Egg whites for you, mister.

04:26.407 --> 04:29.042
I know. A boy can dream, can't he?

04:29.077 --> 04:32.179
Hey, what would you say
about going to Nashville,

04:32.213 --> 04:33.247
just the two of us?

04:34.282 --> 04:35.449
- Nashville?
- Yeah!

04:35.483 --> 04:38.051
I've got this G.O.P. thing
for elected state reps.

04:38.086 --> 04:40.087
It'll only take a couple
of hours and after that

04:40.121 --> 04:42.122
we could enjoy the city, take a tour.

04:42.157 --> 04:45.058
Go see the Grand Ole Opry?

04:45.093 --> 04:47.494
- Whatever you want.
- Well, it sounds like fun.

04:47.529 --> 04:50.230
Great! It's the last
weekend of the month, so...

04:50.265 --> 04:52.332
Wait, this month?

04:52.367 --> 04:54.368
- Shoot.
- What?

04:54.402 --> 04:57.437
That's when Renzo and I are going to go
to New York to pitch my new book idea.

04:57.472 --> 04:59.439
Wait, whoa whoa, wait a second.

04:59.474 --> 05:02.109
You are going to New York with Renzo?

05:02.143 --> 05:04.278
Yeah, I was waiting for Renzo

05:04.312 --> 05:06.213
to confirm the dates before I told you.

05:06.247 --> 05:08.448
He has this friend at a
publishing house, an editor.

05:08.483 --> 05:11.285
Okay fine, fly into
New York, do your pitch,

05:11.319 --> 05:13.387
then come join your husband in Nashville.

05:13.421 --> 05:16.056
But I'll already be there. You
know how much I love New York.

05:16.090 --> 05:18.258
- Wait a second, so this is a vacation now?
- No!

05:18.293 --> 05:21.328
This could jump-start my writing career.

05:21.362 --> 05:25.065
Renzo helped me find a
new angle on an old idea,

05:25.099 --> 05:27.334
and before I knew it he
planned this whole trip.

05:29.070 --> 05:31.471
Please, I'm sorry, honey.
This... this is important to me.

05:31.506 --> 05:34.174
No, I get it. You want to fly solo.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.210
Well, you know what?

05:36.244 --> 05:37.377
I can fly solo too.

05:44.118 --> 05:45.519
Have a seat. It shouldn't be too long.

05:52.427 --> 05:54.261
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.197
How was your weekend?

05:57.232 --> 05:59.399
Good. You?

05:59.434 --> 06:01.168
Good.

06:04.072 --> 06:06.373
Uh, you and your girlfriend

06:06.407 --> 06:09.009
went to some lake, right?

06:09.043 --> 06:10.444
Blue Springs.

06:10.478 --> 06:13.447
Her folks have a place there.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.452
- Sounds fun.
- Hey, sorry to interrupt.

06:18.486 --> 06:22.055
- You're not interrupting.
- Yeah, I need to finish this.

06:24.392 --> 06:26.126
So someone told me

06:26.160 --> 06:28.228
you made those vegan
brownies in the kitchen?

06:28.263 --> 06:32.032
- Oh yeah, help yourself.
- I'm not the vegan type.

06:32.066 --> 06:34.167
But my future
brother-in-law is

06:34.202 --> 06:36.470
and we're having this engagement
party for him and my sister...

06:36.504 --> 06:39.539
tomorrow. Kinda wondering
if I can get the recipe?

06:39.574 --> 06:42.109
Well, I could just make
you a batch, if you want.

06:42.143 --> 06:44.044
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

06:44.078 --> 06:45.512
That'd be a huge help.

06:45.546 --> 06:47.080
- Um...
- Thanks.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.449
You should come.

06:49.484 --> 06:51.485
It'll be super casual.

06:51.519 --> 06:54.488
Kinda figured you haven't had
authentic Mexican food in a while.

06:54.522 --> 06:56.423
- So...
- I'd love to.

06:56.522 --> 06:59.191
Cool. I'll give you the address.

07:03.162 --> 07:04.229
Here.

07:09.335 --> 07:11.236
What I love the most...

07:11.270 --> 07:13.472
the way you split the
living room into two rooms.

07:13.506 --> 07:16.508
Now Harry can watch TV while I read in bed.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.544
You're a genius. It's
going to feel like we moved.

07:19.579 --> 07:22.381
I am so glad you're happy.

07:22.415 --> 07:26.284
Now if you could do something about
that eyesore across the street.

07:26.319 --> 07:28.253
Yeah, I saw the "for sale" sign.

07:28.287 --> 07:29.521
Didn't it use to be an auditorium?

07:29.555 --> 07:31.423
It's been empty going on two years now.

07:31.457 --> 07:33.291
It's such a shame.

07:33.326 --> 07:35.427
Back in the day, it was
such a pretty building.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.363
- Yeah.
- It's a pit.

07:38.398 --> 07:40.332
It's a diamond in the rough.

07:40.366 --> 07:43.435
A forgotten piece of art deco architecture

07:43.469 --> 07:46.338
designed by Kansas City's
own Barrett & Powers.

07:46.372 --> 07:47.506
- Is that true?
- I stopped by

07:47.540 --> 07:50.142
the housing services office
before coming over here.

07:50.176 --> 07:51.443
I figure why go all the way to Denver

07:51.477 --> 07:54.112
when we have potential like
this in our own backyard?

07:54.147 --> 07:56.448
East Riverside is nowhere near my backyard.

07:56.482 --> 07:58.550
I grew up there. It was
a beautiful neighborhood.

07:58.584 --> 08:01.319
People took care of their homes,
had pride in their community.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.388
- What kind of trees are there?
- Trees?

08:03.423 --> 08:05.490
- Uh, sycamores mostly.
- Big ones?

08:05.525 --> 08:07.292
Yeah. Why?

08:07.326 --> 08:10.262
It means the original developers
wanted the neighborhood to be elegant.

08:10.376 --> 08:13.478
Okay, tell me more.

08:15.448 --> 08:16.414
Okay.

08:17.650 --> 08:19.518
You see that?

08:26.076 --> 08:28.320
____

08:28.327 --> 08:30.562
Maybe. I have to get in first.

08:30.563 --> 08:32.770
____

08:32.772 --> 08:35.275
____

08:35.277 --> 08:37.979
____

08:37.980 --> 08:40.674
____

08:41.506 --> 08:42.474
That'd be awesome.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.575
____

08:57.690 --> 09:00.325
You don't need to take a picture of that.

09:05.326 --> 09:07.797
____

09:09.468 --> 09:11.570
I made it for Ty

09:11.604 --> 09:14.406
the first time he went to Afghanistan.

09:16.609 --> 09:20.178
See? This is why I'm so
ready to move to New York.

09:20.213 --> 09:22.447
I won't be reminded of things

09:22.481 --> 09:24.616
that I just don't want to be reminded of.

09:27.210 --> 09:31.460
____

09:31.467 --> 09:32.591
Hmph.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.227
You'd be surprised.
With the Internet, no...

09:40.533 --> 09:42.500
You have a text from Mandy.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.409
With the Internet, no one
is more than a click away.

09:51.444 --> 09:52.544
Wow.

09:52.578 --> 09:54.646
Mandy again.

09:56.215 --> 09:58.350
She must have the world's fastest thumbs.

10:02.462 --> 10:05.495
____

10:06.525 --> 10:09.327
Who's Mandy? Does she go to Carlton?

10:09.328 --> 10:11.602
____

10:11.604 --> 10:12.637
Seattle?

10:12.638 --> 10:17.999
____

10:19.340 --> 10:21.403
____

10:22.515 --> 10:23.681
So are you two like...

10:23.716 --> 10:25.550
together?

10:25.551 --> 10:30.903
____

10:55.090 --> 10:56.157
Aaay!

10:58.360 --> 11:00.028
Yeah.

11:00.029 --> 11:02.862
____

11:02.932 --> 11:05.967
Yes, hot off the lot, my friend.

11:06.001 --> 11:07.869
And they threw in the jacket too.

11:09.592 --> 11:12.572
____

11:13.075 --> 11:14.943
Bad ass. Yes, thank you.

11:14.977 --> 11:17.845
Handles amazing. You should see

11:17.880 --> 11:19.247
the way it carves the corners.

11:19.281 --> 11:22.951
Those tires, they grip the road like claws.

11:35.036 --> 11:36.399
____

11:36.865 --> 11:39.167
No. No, I'm afraid

11:39.201 --> 11:41.169
this would be too much for you to handle.

11:41.203 --> 11:44.238
But I'm getting the hang
of it myself right now.

11:44.273 --> 11:46.307
But you know what? Later, down the road,

11:46.342 --> 11:49.010
you and I, I will put you on the back

11:49.044 --> 11:50.979
and I'll take you out.

11:56.227 --> 12:00.267
____

12:01.924 --> 12:04.158
She is gonna love it!

12:05.194 --> 12:06.961
A motorcycle?!

12:06.996 --> 12:10.832
Do you remember the fuss we made
over Daphne riding with Emmett?

12:10.866 --> 12:12.266
You're gonna look like a hypocrite!

12:12.301 --> 12:15.870
Daphne is a teenager. I am a grown-up.

12:15.904 --> 12:18.172
- A grown-up with a death wish.
- Actually I have never felt

12:18.207 --> 12:20.208
more alive than when I'm riding that thing.

12:20.242 --> 12:23.111
And now I know what tap
dancing must feel like for you.

12:23.145 --> 12:25.813
Tap dancing doesn't kill anyone.

12:27.282 --> 12:31.152
Uh, whose bike is that in the driveway?

12:31.186 --> 12:33.154
Don't tell me it's another
one of Angelo's toys?

12:33.188 --> 12:35.189
No, it's your father's.

12:35.224 --> 12:37.925
Dad!

12:37.960 --> 12:40.028
Hmm, well-played, parental unit.

12:40.062 --> 12:42.063
I didn't know you were into motorcycles.

12:42.097 --> 12:44.132
- Neither did I.
- It's a recent passion.

12:44.166 --> 12:47.035
- Isn't riding awesome?
- Totally.

12:47.069 --> 12:50.004
You should show it to Emmett.
You two could go riding together.

12:50.039 --> 12:51.939
No, he should not.

12:51.974 --> 12:54.909
I am not okay with this, John.

12:54.943 --> 12:56.144
Girls.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.249
I would appreciate you getting rid of it

13:01.283 --> 13:04.252
before Toby sees it and gets
some crazy ideas of his own.

13:04.286 --> 13:06.954
Get rid of it? No way.

13:06.989 --> 13:09.891
Are you doing this because I'm
going to New York with Renzo?

13:09.925 --> 13:12.126
You know what, Kathryn? I am
sorry that you don't like it,

13:12.161 --> 13:16.030
but this is really important to me.

13:16.065 --> 13:17.965
The bike stays.

13:21.303 --> 13:23.905
- Hello?
- We have a problem.

13:23.939 --> 13:25.873
Christy?

13:25.908 --> 13:28.910
- Your check bounced.
- What are you talking about?

13:28.944 --> 13:30.912
For the down payment on the restaurant?

13:30.946 --> 13:34.215
- But that's impossible.
- Oh well, I'm looking right at it.

13:34.249 --> 13:36.084
Obviously there must be a mistake.

13:36.118 --> 13:38.820
Yeah, my mother should've never
gone into business with you.

13:38.854 --> 13:40.922
- Hey, I'm a partner...
- Not if you miss a payment.

13:40.956 --> 13:42.890
Then you're in breach of
contract and you're out.

13:42.925 --> 13:44.125
Look, I have the money.

13:44.159 --> 13:46.060
Let me call the bank and
figure out what happened.

13:46.095 --> 13:49.130
Okay, I get a new check
by end of business today

13:49.164 --> 13:51.199
or the next call will be from my lawyer.

13:52.334 --> 13:54.068
Don't worry,

13:54.103 --> 13:56.237
- I'll fix this.
- Hope so.

14:00.976 --> 14:03.878
Wait, how can you be upset by an
email that you haven't even read?

14:03.912 --> 14:06.981
What if it says something
that I don't want to hear?

14:07.015 --> 14:09.250
I'm not gonna lie: Part of me is hoping

14:09.284 --> 14:12.987
that he will just say he feels
bad for what he did to me.

14:13.021 --> 14:15.156
And then another part of me

14:15.190 --> 14:17.225
is hoping that he'll
ask to get back together.

14:17.259 --> 14:20.128
But if he says neither of those
things, then I'm just gonna feel mad

14:20.162 --> 14:22.797
and sad all over again.

14:22.831 --> 14:25.166
And then what if he's totally
unclear about what he's saying?

14:25.200 --> 14:28.169
Then I'm just gonna reread
the email over and over again

14:28.203 --> 14:30.938
a thousand times until I go crazy.

14:30.973 --> 14:33.875
- Sounds like a lose-lose.
- Exactly!

14:33.909 --> 14:35.810
You know, you're the only
person that I've told.

14:35.844 --> 14:38.112
I tried to tell Emmett, but
then got totally sucker-punched

14:38.147 --> 14:41.149
when he told me about his
new girlfriend... Mandy.

14:41.183 --> 14:43.151
- Why should that matter?
- It doesn't.

14:43.185 --> 14:45.820
I mean, we've been broken
up for a year, so obviously

14:45.854 --> 14:47.922
I have no right to feel
jealous or possessive.

14:47.956 --> 14:49.023
Unless you like him.

14:49.057 --> 14:50.892
Which I don't.

14:50.926 --> 14:53.261
- I'm just curious.
- Is she hot?

14:53.295 --> 14:56.898
I don't know. She lives in
Seattle. They met online.

14:56.932 --> 14:59.800
Ha! Wait a minute, online?

14:59.835 --> 15:02.770
- No no no, that's not dating.
- No, it's serious.

15:02.804 --> 15:05.907
- Trust me, I know Emmett.
- Have they met?

15:05.941 --> 15:09.877
- I don't think so.
- She probably has buckteeth and bad breath.

15:09.912 --> 15:12.980
Or maybe she's a dude, like
what happened to Manti Te'o.

15:13.015 --> 15:15.917
I don't know who that is, but I doubt it.

15:15.951 --> 15:18.119
- Emmett's not stupid.
- Look,

15:18.153 --> 15:20.888
you don't need to sweat
an online girlfriend, okay?

15:20.923 --> 15:23.791
Just trust me, she's
just pixels on a screen.

15:24.993 --> 15:26.160
You're right.

15:45.013 --> 15:47.949
- Hey... hey, you made it okay.
- Hi.

15:47.983 --> 15:50.117
Yeah, used to live six
blocks away, remember?

15:50.152 --> 15:52.853
- You look really nice.
- Thanks.

15:52.888 --> 15:56.991
Hey, everyone, this is Daphne Vasquez.

15:57.025 --> 15:59.994
Um, that's my family. That's Mario,

16:00.028 --> 16:02.863
Angelica, Nadia,

16:02.898 --> 16:04.899
Tia Gema, Alfredo,

16:04.933 --> 16:06.934
Homero, where's Tio Beto at?

16:06.969 --> 16:09.003
Tio Beto! Beto right there.

16:09.037 --> 16:11.072
And oh...

16:11.073 --> 16:14.632
____

16:15.077 --> 16:16.877
Okay, come on.

16:16.912 --> 16:19.880
- So are you all... ?
- Siblings.

16:19.915 --> 16:21.249
And cousins.

16:21.283 --> 16:25.786
Jorge hardly ever brings girls
around. You must be pretty special.

16:25.821 --> 16:27.788
Okay, Tina, please.

16:27.823 --> 16:29.790
I made vegan brownies

16:29.825 --> 16:32.126
and vegan Mexican wedding
cookies. Couldn't resist.

16:32.160 --> 16:35.196
Oh my God, my fiancé is gonna be in heaven.

16:39.268 --> 16:41.102
One...

16:41.136 --> 16:43.804
Oh, mija, what's up? ¿Que Paso?

16:43.839 --> 16:45.239
Does it hurt right here? Yeah?

16:45.274 --> 16:47.842
I'll make it feel better. Okay? You ready?

16:59.121 --> 17:01.222
Better? Okay. Get out of here.

17:01.256 --> 17:03.190
Go play with your friends.

17:07.229 --> 17:08.996
Hungry?

17:09.031 --> 17:10.798
- Definitely.
- Yes!

17:10.832 --> 17:12.133
Come on.

17:13.234 --> 17:15.236
The plumbing is all copper

17:15.270 --> 17:17.204
and the floors are wide-plank walnut.

17:17.239 --> 17:20.174
- They really knew how to build 'em back then.
- A building this old,

17:20.208 --> 17:21.976
the whole thing has to
be brought up to code

17:22.010 --> 17:23.978
and there's nothing cheap about that.

17:24.012 --> 17:26.946
The realtor is an old high
school classmate of mine.

17:26.982 --> 17:29.250
She says that the owner
is very motivated to sell.

17:29.284 --> 17:31.852
- You didn't mention my name, I hope.
- No, of course not.

17:31.887 --> 17:33.854
I just told her I knew a potential buyer.

17:33.889 --> 17:36.891
Good, 'cause prices tend to get
jacked up when people hear my name.

17:36.925 --> 17:38.959
She agrees, East
Riverside is not there yet,

17:38.994 --> 17:41.962
but it's next to Parkville,
which is very up-and-coming.

17:43.832 --> 17:46.167
Okay, if we do this, we need
to be strategic about it.

17:46.201 --> 17:48.235
So you are interested?

17:48.270 --> 17:51.038
Well, I know these
guys... some tech start-up,

17:51.073 --> 17:54.041
some new twist on a dating
app... looking for a headquarters.

17:54.076 --> 17:56.143
If you want I can take you there today.

17:56.178 --> 17:58.079
Okay. Make it happen.

17:58.113 --> 18:00.114
That is so exciting!

18:00.148 --> 18:04.085
- What is?
- Oh, Wes is considering

18:04.119 --> 18:06.887
a restoration project in East Riverside.

18:06.922 --> 18:09.156
This is my husband
Angelo. This is Wes Gable.

18:09.191 --> 18:11.158
- Nice to meet you, West.
- It's Wes.

18:11.193 --> 18:13.227
Sorry, West.

18:13.261 --> 18:15.096
He's Italian.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.931
Well, it was nice to meet you.

18:16.965 --> 18:18.933
- And we'll talk later.
- Yes.

18:21.937 --> 18:24.138
- So what's up?
- Did you take money

18:24.172 --> 18:26.107
out of the joint account to pay Whitney?

18:26.141 --> 18:28.943
- Yeah. Why?
- I also wrote a check for the restaurant.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.078
- Christy just called and said...
- Who's Christy?

18:31.113 --> 18:33.848
Barbara Salz's daughter. The check bounced.

18:33.882 --> 18:35.783
- What? Why?
- I need you...

18:35.817 --> 18:37.785
I need you to get that
money back in the account.

18:37.819 --> 18:40.921
Tell Whitney you'll send her another
check in a week, maybe two, okay?

18:40.956 --> 18:46.026
- I can't do that.
- I need that money for the restaurant... now.

18:46.061 --> 18:48.262
It's only 50 grand. Can't you
just pull it from another account?

18:56.905 --> 18:58.773
No, I cannot.

18:58.807 --> 19:00.040
Why not?

19:01.209 --> 19:04.145
Angelo, what's going on?

19:06.014 --> 19:08.849
What's left of the money is all tied up.

19:08.884 --> 19:11.152
What do you mean "what's left"?

19:11.186 --> 19:14.021
You won $5 million in a
lawsuit. Where did it all go?

19:14.055 --> 19:17.758
A third to my attorney,
another third to taxes,

19:17.793 --> 19:19.894
nearly half a million dollars on the house.

19:19.928 --> 19:21.829
- I mean I...
- All right, all right.

19:24.933 --> 19:26.801
I had no idea.

19:31.907 --> 19:33.174
We're in this together.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.843
You could've told me.

19:35.877 --> 19:38.145
I kept thinking I'd turn it around.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.815
And I will, with this restaurant.

19:40.849 --> 19:43.784
You don't know that.
Restaurants are a huge gamble.

19:43.819 --> 19:45.886
No, these people have opened three already,

19:45.921 --> 19:47.888
and they're all turning huge profits.

19:47.923 --> 19:50.991
I've done my homework. You've
got to trust me on this.

19:51.026 --> 19:52.193
Please.

19:53.228 --> 19:54.995
So where does that leave us?

19:56.832 --> 19:58.132
Well...

19:58.166 --> 20:00.134
we don't have the money for both.

20:03.271 --> 20:05.873
Something has to give.

20:07.142 --> 20:09.143
And that something is me.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.608
"When I look at your photos,

20:20.642 --> 20:24.278
it's like I'm reading a line
from my favorite poem twice."

20:24.312 --> 20:27.348
Wow, Mandy, you are so deep.

20:29.618 --> 20:31.352
Maybe you are a dude.

20:32.387 --> 20:34.655
"Mandy starling, 17, hoping to attend

20:34.689 --> 20:36.523
Gallaudet University... "

20:38.360 --> 20:40.261
"In a relationship."

20:42.364 --> 20:46.233
Look at you, Mandy, thinking
your very deep thoughts.

20:46.268 --> 20:48.602
Definitely not a dude.

20:48.637 --> 20:50.638
Thanks, Sophie. Enjoy Cabo.

20:50.672 --> 20:53.274
Hey, Frank, sorry to keep you hanging.

20:53.308 --> 20:54.608
We lost him.

20:54.643 --> 20:57.311
- So find him.
- Hi.

20:57.345 --> 20:59.647
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, I...

20:59.681 --> 21:02.416
Can we talk? It's personal.

21:02.450 --> 21:04.385
Yeah. Give us a minute, then go find Frank.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.524
I'll get right to the point.

21:10.558 --> 21:13.460
I need to ask for an
advance on my billings.

21:13.495 --> 21:15.496
For how much?

21:15.530 --> 21:18.399
- $50,000.
- What's it for?

21:20.402 --> 21:22.403
I need to buy out the rest of K&D.

21:22.437 --> 21:24.505
You agreed to buy a
business you can't afford?

21:24.539 --> 21:26.407
At the time I thought I could.

21:26.441 --> 21:28.442
Things have changed.

21:28.476 --> 21:31.345
I took a gamble, just like
you're taking a gamble on me.

21:31.379 --> 21:33.681
You're not exactly
shoring up my confidence.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.285
Okay. The money's yours.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.521
Under one condition.

21:40.555 --> 21:43.524
You work for me exclusively.

21:43.558 --> 21:46.660
I need other clients to
keep my business afloat.

21:46.695 --> 21:49.296
That's okay, I'll keep you busy.

21:49.331 --> 21:52.266
- Fine.
- I'll have my accountant cut you a check.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.501
I have Frank on the line.

21:54.536 --> 21:57.237
Frank, dude! Sorry about that.

22:00.241 --> 22:01.575
Okay.

22:01.609 --> 22:04.611
You're right, I have missed this.

22:04.646 --> 22:07.348
And these tamales are so good!

22:07.382 --> 22:10.351
- I made 'em myself.
- Seriously?

22:10.385 --> 22:12.353
I mean, it's my mom's recipe, so.

22:12.387 --> 22:15.189
Oh, did I miss her? Is she here?

22:15.223 --> 22:17.191
No. Uh, she, uh...

22:17.225 --> 22:19.593
she passed away five
years ago. Breast cancer.

22:19.627 --> 22:22.329
Oh. I'm sorry.

22:22.364 --> 22:24.264
I mean...

22:24.299 --> 22:26.266
it's actually what led me to nursing.

22:26.301 --> 22:29.269
'Cause the doctors,
they put her through hell

22:29.304 --> 22:31.338
trying to fix her, but the nurses,

22:31.373 --> 22:33.540
they treated her like a person, you know?

22:33.575 --> 22:35.676
They took care of her... mind, body,

22:35.710 --> 22:39.480
her spirit. It made all the difference.

22:39.514 --> 22:41.615
Well, I've watched you with patients.

22:41.649 --> 22:44.218
You have the same gift.

22:44.252 --> 22:47.388
Oscar loves those cookies.

22:47.422 --> 22:49.590
- Good, I'm glad.
- He deserves them,

22:49.624 --> 22:52.326
for making an honest woman
out of the family republican.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.695
Hey, and you're clearly
not the family comedian.

22:54.729 --> 22:56.663
For what it's worth,

22:56.698 --> 22:58.632
my dad's the republican state senator.

22:58.666 --> 23:01.301
Not a Kansas senator.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.271
- I'd know a Senator Vasquez.
- My dad's John Kennish.

23:04.305 --> 23:06.273
Wait...

23:06.307 --> 23:08.609
Are you the daughter who
blackmailed Chip Coto?

23:08.643 --> 23:11.178
Whoa, hey, Tina, what are you...

23:11.212 --> 23:12.446
what are you talking about?

23:12.480 --> 23:14.381
Coto resigned last summer, remember?

23:14.416 --> 23:17.251
An intern blackmailed him.

23:17.285 --> 23:18.519
Was that you?

23:18.553 --> 23:21.522
- Yeah, it was, but...
- Do you have any idea

23:21.556 --> 23:24.558
how hard it is for a Latino
to get elected in Kansas?

23:24.592 --> 23:26.493
Hey, Tina, right now's not the time.

23:26.528 --> 23:28.662
I campaigned door to door for Chip Coto.

23:28.696 --> 23:31.331
He could've been our first Latino governor.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.467
How could you do that,
bring down one of your own?

23:33.501 --> 23:35.402
Coto brought himself down.

23:35.437 --> 23:37.571
He was cheating on his
wife with an intern and...

23:37.605 --> 23:39.440
And you blackmailed him.

23:39.474 --> 23:41.241
That's a felony!

23:41.276 --> 23:42.509
How could you bring her here?

23:42.544 --> 23:44.311
- I'm gonna go.
- No no no, please.

23:44.345 --> 23:46.680
- Yeah no.
- Come on.

23:46.714 --> 23:50.217
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about my sister, all right?

23:50.251 --> 23:51.652
She can get a little carried away.

23:51.686 --> 23:54.388
- She has a right to her opinion.
- No, look...

23:57.459 --> 23:59.626
it was starting to feel like a date, right?

24:02.597 --> 24:04.465
I'll see you back at the clinic.

24:16.504 --> 24:18.602
____

24:20.743 --> 24:24.174
____

24:30.662 --> 24:32.564
____

24:41.483 --> 24:44.785
So you don't think there's
strings attached to that money?

24:44.819 --> 24:48.389
- It's business.
- I know guys like West.

24:48.423 --> 24:51.558
To him, you're just another piece of ass.

24:51.593 --> 24:53.594
Do you know how insulting that is?

24:53.628 --> 24:55.496
Do you even hear yourself?

24:55.530 --> 24:58.399
You're just jealous because he
can give me what you can't...

24:58.433 --> 25:00.401
the money to fix your mistakes.

25:00.435 --> 25:02.703
I don't want you to work for that man.

25:02.737 --> 25:05.406
I don't get to approve
of your business partners,

25:05.440 --> 25:07.508
why should you get to approve
of mine? For all I know

25:07.542 --> 25:09.643
Christy Salz could be
some 25-year-old floozy.

25:09.678 --> 25:12.413
So now who's jealous?

25:12.447 --> 25:16.617
I want K&D. I need Wes to
make that happen. End of story.

25:33.568 --> 25:36.337
- Off to the gay pride parade?
- Very funny.

25:36.371 --> 25:38.572
I'm going for a ride. Get out of the city,

25:38.606 --> 25:41.608
find a country road where
the leaves are turning.

25:41.643 --> 25:43.444
I'm sorry, who are you again?

25:43.478 --> 25:46.647
Kathryn, care to join me? I
bought you an extra helmet.

25:46.681 --> 25:49.616
Yeah, mom, you could
borrow my leather jacket.

25:49.651 --> 25:52.519
No, thank you. I'd rather
not end up as roadkill.

25:52.554 --> 25:54.355
Suit yourself.

25:55.657 --> 25:58.559
- Hey, be home before dark, honey.
- Yes, mom!

26:00.395 --> 26:03.697
- I should get going too.
- Where are you off to?

26:03.732 --> 26:06.667
Oh, just someplace dark and cold

26:06.701 --> 26:10.704
- to look at stars. Hence the hot chocolate.
- Sounds romantic.

26:10.739 --> 26:13.707
No, not really. It's just a school project.

26:15.543 --> 26:17.478
Wait, would romance be such a bad thing?

26:17.512 --> 26:19.380
You haven't dated anyone since Ty.

26:19.414 --> 26:22.416
Mom, I'm going with Emmett
and he is seeing someone, so...

26:22.450 --> 26:24.752
- Oh. Who?
- Don't know.

26:24.786 --> 26:27.554
Don't care. Her name's Mandy.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.624
Well, I'm glad you two can be friends.

26:30.658 --> 26:34.428
It's really fun to have a male companion
without any romantic complications.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.431
Right. Me and Emmett are just friends.

26:37.465 --> 26:40.734
No romantic complications. I should go.

26:40.769 --> 26:42.636
Have fun.

26:48.810 --> 26:49.990
Why is it red?

26:49.991 --> 26:53.545
____

26:53.546 --> 26:56.014
____

26:56.684 --> 26:58.385
When you said "star party,"

26:58.420 --> 26:59.686
I was kinda picturing, you know, a party.

26:59.687 --> 27:03.517
____

27:07.429 --> 27:11.565
Okay, you are totally earning
your nerd cred right now.

27:11.599 --> 27:15.736
Oh no! You know that I don't dance.

27:20.542 --> 27:22.309
Mandy?

27:25.704 --> 27:28.013
____

27:29.651 --> 27:30.515
You know, I don't mind.

27:30.516 --> 27:34.994
____

27:35.457 --> 27:37.424
So what's that like,

27:37.459 --> 27:39.726
the whole online thing? I mean
have you guys met in person?

27:40.460 --> 27:42.484
____

27:51.639 --> 27:54.441
Oooh... oh.

27:54.476 --> 27:56.510
Hey.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.412
Hey.

27:58.446 --> 28:01.715
- You okay?
- Kind of a crappy day.

28:01.749 --> 28:04.318
Want to talk about it?

28:05.453 --> 28:07.287
Not really.

28:08.556 --> 28:09.690
All right.

28:09.724 --> 28:11.458
Let's play then.

28:11.493 --> 28:14.428
Well, I kind of have an unfair advantage.

28:15.697 --> 28:17.698
Actually...

28:17.732 --> 28:19.299
I do.

28:22.604 --> 28:23.637
Oh, game on.

28:27.575 --> 28:28.542
Come on.

28:34.816 --> 28:36.316
Come on!

28:38.686 --> 28:40.354
No!

28:45.627 --> 28:47.361
You gotta move with your wheels.

28:49.364 --> 28:51.465
Really?

28:51.499 --> 28:53.433
You want it that badly? Here.

28:53.468 --> 28:55.536
Make your shots.

28:55.570 --> 28:58.305
It's a tie game.

28:58.339 --> 29:00.307
Yeah? Not for long.

29:06.681 --> 29:08.415
- What are you doing?
- Hey...

29:08.449 --> 29:10.617
I'm sorry, I...

29:10.652 --> 29:12.553
- You have a girlfriend.
- I know.

29:12.587 --> 29:14.354
I... it's complicated.

29:14.389 --> 29:16.523
- No, it's not.
- Just...

29:16.558 --> 29:17.758
let me explain.

29:20.461 --> 29:23.297
I've been with Gretchen, well,

29:23.331 --> 29:25.399
since before the accident.

29:25.433 --> 29:28.302
I wouldn't have been able
to make it without her.

29:28.336 --> 29:30.370
Then why are you trying to kiss me?

29:31.573 --> 29:34.374
It's not the same between us anymore.

29:35.510 --> 29:37.778
And I can't just break up with her.

29:37.812 --> 29:39.479
I'm not asking you to.

29:40.648 --> 29:42.382
I like you.

29:42.417 --> 29:45.485
I just have to figure some things out.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.455
Everything you do... every single thing...

29:48.489 --> 29:52.326
has a ripple effect. So
you can't just go around

29:52.360 --> 29:55.395
doing what you want to do, because
it will come back to you somehow.

29:55.430 --> 29:57.764
I know. I'm...

29:57.799 --> 30:00.601
I'm just confused.

30:00.635 --> 30:02.669
Well, I'm not.

30:02.704 --> 30:04.504
Not anymore.

30:05.707 --> 30:07.374
I gotta go.

30:18.796 --> 30:20.463
You wanted to see me?

30:22.533 --> 30:24.667
You hungry?

30:24.702 --> 30:26.769
Thanks. I already ate.

30:28.606 --> 30:30.807
It's late. Didn't you say you had kids?

30:30.841 --> 30:32.675
They're with their mother tonight.

30:32.710 --> 30:36.479
Two boys, ten and six.

30:36.514 --> 30:38.815
- That's nice.
- I made an offer on the East Riverside property.

30:38.849 --> 30:41.751
Contingent on inspections, of course.

30:41.785 --> 30:43.887
Wow, that was fast.

30:43.921 --> 30:45.822
When I want something I make it happen.

30:47.525 --> 30:49.425
Come on, have a look.

30:49.460 --> 30:51.528
I ran the metrics on East Riverside.

30:51.562 --> 30:53.763
The area's more promising than I thought.

30:53.797 --> 30:55.698
As you mentioned.

30:55.733 --> 30:57.600
This is our property right here.

30:57.635 --> 31:00.503
Down the street there's an empty lot,
so I'm thinking mixed-use development:

31:00.538 --> 31:02.705
Apartments for the tech
hipsters, organic coffeehouses,

31:02.740 --> 31:05.575
- juice bars.
- That is so cool.

31:05.609 --> 31:07.544
It'll bring back a sense of community,

31:07.578 --> 31:09.579
make it feel like a neighborhood again.

31:09.613 --> 31:12.448
Yeah, we can get rid of these storefronts
right here and put in a green space.

31:12.483 --> 31:14.717
Well, those are
mom-and-pop shops.

31:14.752 --> 31:16.719
A barber and a shoe repair.

31:16.754 --> 31:19.389
Most of those have been there since
I was a kid. Where would they go?

31:19.423 --> 31:21.624
We'll give them first dibs
on the mixed-use space.

31:21.659 --> 31:23.760
At double or triple the
rents they're paying now?

31:23.794 --> 31:27.564
Then I'll buy them out. Don't
worry, they'll be more than okay.

31:34.538 --> 31:36.773
Oh hey, honey.

31:36.807 --> 31:39.742
Yeah, I'm on Route Seven,
just south of Atchison.

31:39.777 --> 31:42.445
Yeah, you know, I just...

31:42.479 --> 31:44.447
time flies on the open road, babe.

31:44.481 --> 31:46.816
Okay well, I'll turn around now.

31:46.850 --> 31:49.419
Uh-huh.

31:49.453 --> 31:50.787
All-righty.
Bye-bye.

31:54.854 --> 31:57.207
____

31:57.394 --> 31:58.795
Yeah.

32:03.814 --> 32:06.540
____

32:06.543 --> 32:08.404
Yeah, I know what you're saying.

32:08.439 --> 32:11.441
Don't go there, just get me home.

32:19.617 --> 32:20.617
Christy?

32:20.651 --> 32:22.518
Angelo Sorrento.

32:22.553 --> 32:24.754
- Of course.
- What?

32:24.788 --> 32:27.657
You are so my mom's type.

32:27.691 --> 32:30.793
- It's nice to finally meet you.
- Drink?

32:30.828 --> 32:33.763
Yes, scotch on the rocks, please.

32:35.566 --> 32:36.532
Oh.

32:37.801 --> 32:39.869
Cashier check, good as gold.

32:39.903 --> 32:42.772
- Smart move.
- Again, I'm so sorry.

32:42.806 --> 32:44.440
It turns out my wife

32:44.475 --> 32:47.510
wrote a check on the same
account and didn't tell me.

32:47.544 --> 32:49.712
Well, the next installment
is due in two weeks.

32:50.881 --> 32:53.416
A mistake was made.

32:53.450 --> 32:55.518
I fixed it, I said I was sorry.

32:55.552 --> 32:58.788
Where I come from, you graciously
accept an apology and move on.

32:58.822 --> 33:01.524
And I don't appreciate being yelled at

33:01.558 --> 33:04.727
or threatened or having
assumptions made about my looks.

33:07.731 --> 33:09.666
I... I'm sorry.

33:09.700 --> 33:12.702
A woman in this world,
sometimes I have to...

33:12.736 --> 33:14.704
Overcompensate.

33:16.573 --> 33:20.476
- So.
- You remind me of Barbara.

33:20.511 --> 33:22.712
In a good way.

33:22.746 --> 33:24.580
Thanks.

33:25.649 --> 33:28.484
Look, we're partners,
we have the same goals.

33:28.519 --> 33:31.721
It's in both our best
interests to get along.

33:31.755 --> 33:34.791
- No?
- The next drink's on you.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.801
Uh, I think it's gonna start pretty soon.

33:45.202 --> 33:46.280
____

33:46.637 --> 33:48.638
Hmmm. Don't worry.

33:48.672 --> 33:50.873
Seattle is two hours behind us,

33:50.908 --> 33:54.410
so you can text Mandy when you get
home and she will still be awake.

33:55.559 --> 33:59.499
____

33:59.750 --> 34:03.453
So do you guys plan on living
together when you go to Gallaudet?

34:03.454 --> 34:04.350
____

34:04.588 --> 34:06.622
What? It's just a question.

34:08.989 --> 34:11.118
____

34:11.395 --> 34:12.695
Well, she's deaf, right?

34:13.779 --> 34:16.085
____

34:18.601 --> 34:21.670
Okay, it's not that hard to
find someone on the Internet.

34:21.705 --> 34:24.507
I just don't understand why
you're keeping it a secret.

34:24.507 --> 34:25.850
____

34:25.851 --> 34:29.534
____

34:29.679 --> 34:31.681
Why? We're just friends, right?

34:31.681 --> 34:34.472
____

34:36.038 --> 34:40.478
____

34:40.623 --> 34:41.858
Okay, that is not the same thing.

34:41.891 --> 34:43.482
This girl lives on the
other side of the country

34:43.483 --> 34:45.828
- ____
- and you haven't even met her yet.

34:45.862 --> 34:49.498
- She's just pixels on a computer screen!
- ____

35:04.448 --> 35:06.682
So you'll cheat on me, but not her?

35:10.048 --> 35:14.476
____

35:14.477 --> 35:17.518
____

35:18.729 --> 35:20.396
I do not.

35:20.397 --> 35:24.458
____

35:26.592 --> 35:29.388
____

35:29.389 --> 35:33.243
____

35:37.190 --> 35:39.511
____

35:43.854 --> 35:45.655
Okay, just wait a second...

35:47.758 --> 35:48.858
oh my God.

35:56.039 --> 35:57.702
____

35:57.734 --> 35:59.335
Emmett, I...

36:00.050 --> 36:05.620
____

36:05.621 --> 36:08.265
____

36:08.266 --> 36:09.766
____

36:27.200 --> 36:28.367
Hey.

36:28.402 --> 36:30.302
How was "the ride"?

36:32.239 --> 36:34.173
Uh...

36:34.207 --> 36:36.242
Not great actually.

36:36.276 --> 36:38.344
I wiped out.

36:38.378 --> 36:41.013
What? Are you okay?

36:41.047 --> 36:44.216
Oh yeah, fine. Travis
came and picked me up.

36:44.251 --> 36:47.019
The bike's ruined.

36:47.053 --> 36:49.989
It's just a bike. Are you
sure you're all right, honey?

36:52.893 --> 36:55.895
I am not running for re-election.

36:57.297 --> 37:00.966
Wait, is that what this is about?

37:01.001 --> 37:03.936
I mean, what a disaster.

37:03.970 --> 37:07.006
So you got off to a rocky start.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.175
- I mean, just give it time.
- Come on, come on.

37:09.209 --> 37:11.110
I am not cut out for politics.

37:11.144 --> 37:14.947
The whole Daphne thing
made that very clear.

37:14.981 --> 37:16.949
I just... it's not a good fit.

37:16.983 --> 37:19.952
I never should have encouraged you to run.

37:19.986 --> 37:21.353
Stop, stop. It's not your fault.

37:21.388 --> 37:25.357
You know, I thought it would
be my new thing, my second act.

37:25.392 --> 37:29.094
My... third act. Ahem.

37:29.129 --> 37:32.031
I'm like a midlife-crisis cliche.

37:32.065 --> 37:34.300
I'm sorry. You'll find something else.

37:38.205 --> 37:39.905
Hi.

37:42.375 --> 37:45.010
Remember that hot chocolate

37:45.045 --> 37:48.147
that we didn't get to
drink at the star party?

37:48.181 --> 37:52.885
Well, I traded it to some astro-nerds

37:52.919 --> 37:57.022
for pictures of the lunar meteor shower.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.893
They're like NASA quality.

38:02.229 --> 38:03.896
They were that nerdy.

38:09.467 --> 38:12.124
____

38:15.125 --> 38:16.202
____

38:18.311 --> 38:22.181
And I'm sorry about
starting a fight with you...

38:24.017 --> 38:26.352
and kissing you. That was wrong.

38:26.353 --> 38:29.789
____

38:33.994 --> 38:34.994
Hey, wait a second. Uh...

38:36.263 --> 38:39.064
You were right about the
Simone cheating thing.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.067
If we're gonna ever have a chance...

38:46.106 --> 38:48.374
I need to let it go and...

38:48.408 --> 38:52.177
I promise not to bring it up again,

38:52.212 --> 38:53.312
ever.

38:58.260 --> 38:59.436
____

39:14.367 --> 39:16.001
Problem?

39:16.036 --> 39:18.037
I can't read Dr. Jackson's handwriting.

39:18.071 --> 39:19.338
What does this say?

39:19.372 --> 39:21.040
"Measles."

39:30.150 --> 39:31.951
Thanks.

39:33.119 --> 39:34.320
No problem.

39:39.025 --> 39:41.994
Hey, Daphne, can I talk to you?

39:43.029 --> 39:44.363
Sure.

39:54.941 --> 39:56.342
I read your blog about Coto.

39:56.376 --> 39:59.144
- Oh God.
- What you wrote was amazing.

39:59.179 --> 40:01.180
- No.
- It was.

40:02.415 --> 40:04.183
It took a lot of courage.

40:04.217 --> 40:07.920
I did do something awful
though. Your sister's right.

40:07.954 --> 40:12.324
Yeah well, we all make mistakes.

40:14.127 --> 40:16.228
And mine yesterday was

40:16.262 --> 40:19.164
not standing up to my sister.
I'm really sorry about that.

40:21.401 --> 40:24.203
- It's okay.
- No.

40:26.106 --> 40:27.373
I should've defended you.

40:30.076 --> 40:31.343
Thanks.

40:54.134 --> 40:56.001
I can definitely do more of that.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.937
- But I kinda have to...
- Right.

40:58.972 --> 41:01.240
Yeah.

41:01.274 --> 41:03.942
Should one of us go out first?

41:10.383 --> 41:12.918
After you.

41:14.354 --> 41:17.289
Hey, I wanted to tell you...

41:18.992 --> 41:20.926
I broke up with Gretchen.
