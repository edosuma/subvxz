-We watched all...
-(snoring)

11:51.080 --> 11:54.080
(sighs)
Good night, Mole.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.080
(yawns)
Rise and shine, Mole!

12:04.080 --> 12:07.750
Mini-Max is gonna
make you one of his
famous breakfast burritos.

12:07.750 --> 12:11.000
Mini-Max:
I substitute a pancake
for the tortilla!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.290
Wakey-wakey!
Who wants a pancakey?

12:13.290 --> 12:15.620
(Fred gasps)
No way!

12:15.620 --> 12:17.670
Richardson has a pillow double?

12:17.670 --> 12:20.500
Mini-Max:
Mini-Maximum
suspicious!

12:20.500 --> 12:24.620
It appears that your
prized undergarments
are missing.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.120
No, they aren't.
They're right...

12:29.000 --> 12:31.500
(shrieks)
Mole!

12:32.620 --> 12:34.380
-(beeps)
-Richardson: Thanks to you,
Frederickson,

12:34.380 --> 12:37.330
-my Captain Fancy collection
just got fancier.
-What?

12:37.330 --> 12:40.290
I set up that Noodle
Burger tasting to lure
you into my trap.

12:40.290 --> 12:44.330
-I thought we were buds!
-I knew you'd think
we were buds! Ha-ha!

12:44.330 --> 12:46.040
You can't get away with this!

12:46.040 --> 12:48.080
And I'm gonna
get away with this.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.460
-But I have evidence.
- Burn.

12:49.460 --> 12:50.790
-(crackles)
-Fred: Ow!

12:50.790 --> 12:52.790
Mini-Max:
I will cool it.

12:54.710 --> 12:56.830
I should not
have used water.

12:56.830 --> 12:59.250
No, probably not.

12:59.250 --> 13:02.250
-What are you going to do?
-There's only one thing
to do, Mini-Max.

13:02.250 --> 13:05.170
-Revenge of--
- Fred, we got a message
from Steamer.

13:05.170 --> 13:06.540
Meet us at school.

13:06.540 --> 13:10.080
Blast! Looks like revenge
will have to be served cold.

13:12.040 --> 13:16.080
Steamer: Big Hero 6,
I'm recording this
while Sue is in the potty.

13:16.080 --> 13:18.330
I don't think
she washes her hands,

13:18.330 --> 13:21.000
-so I have to be quick!
-Not cool, Sue. Not cool.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.830
Steamer:
Take heed, heroes.
Sue's secret skate lair

13:23.830 --> 13:26.080
is in an abandoned
factory near the docks.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.170
I can't believe I used
this precious amount
of time to record

13:29.170 --> 13:31.170
a wax cylinder
instead of escaping.

13:31.170 --> 13:34.250
-Anyway, hurry.
-That is a trap.

13:34.250 --> 13:37.210
-Yeah. She probably
made him record that.
-But we still have to go.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.790
-Right?
-I put my underpants revenge
on hold for this.

13:39.790 --> 13:41.880
I'll explain on the way.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.420
(whooshes)

13:47.540 --> 13:50.750
Oh, no!
The circus is in town!

13:50.750 --> 13:52.170
How did you ever find me?

13:52.920 --> 13:54.880
Steamer:
You fell for our trap!

13:54.880 --> 13:56.710
Just for the record,
I didn't.

13:56.710 --> 14:00.710
Aw, were the "wittle" heroes
outsmarted by maturity?

14:00.710 --> 14:02.170
Why are you
talking like that?

14:02.170 --> 14:04.620
'Cause it's funny.
Lighten up.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.040
(grunts)

14:08.830 --> 14:10.710
Ha-ha-ha!
(yells)

14:13.420 --> 14:14.710
(screams)

14:16.460 --> 14:18.330
Who's ready for
a butt to the gut?

14:18.330 --> 14:20.420
Fred:
Bring it... oh!

14:21.420 --> 14:23.170
(groans)

14:23.170 --> 14:26.710
Goal!
One down, five to go.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.290
(beeping)

14:31.290 --> 14:33.250
(whooshing)

14:33.250 --> 14:34.960
(ice crackling)

14:36.170 --> 14:38.170
Supersonic Sue:
Thanks for the whip, toothpick!

14:38.170 --> 14:39.460
(yelps)

14:39.460 --> 14:42.250
Name-calling is
totally immature!

14:42.250 --> 14:45.830
-Supersonic Sue me,
why don't ya?
-How about this instead?

14:51.380 --> 14:54.170
-(Supersonic Sue laughs)
-(Wasabi grunting)

14:54.170 --> 14:56.040
(panting)

14:56.040 --> 14:57.960
That all you got,
laser paws?

14:57.960 --> 14:59.460
(panting)

14:59.460 --> 15:03.290
-Give me... a second.
-Okay. One.

15:03.290 --> 15:06.880
-(clattering)
-Who else wants
a shoulder sandwich?

15:15.460 --> 15:17.960
-Hiro:
Wasabi, watch out!
-(Wasabi shrieks)

15:19.830 --> 15:20.830
(yells)

15:23.670 --> 15:26.120
(Steamer grunting)

15:26.120 --> 15:29.460
This isn't my first rodeo,
junior!

15:35.120 --> 15:36.250
(grunts)

15:38.750 --> 15:41.080
(crackling)

15:41.080 --> 15:43.500
-(grunting)
-(yelling)

15:43.500 --> 15:44.670
(screams)

15:44.670 --> 15:46.960
Baymax, rocket fist!

15:46.960 --> 15:48.500
(mockingly):
Playmac, rocket fist.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
(grunts)

15:53.620 --> 15:56.380
Well, looks like
it's down to you, fire truck.

15:56.380 --> 15:59.170
(groans) Baymax,
overdrive mode!

15:59.170 --> 16:01.960
Baymax:
Overdrive mode
initiated.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.170
(whirring)

16:08.500 --> 16:11.380
Hey, Steamer.
Can your bug thing
do that?

16:11.380 --> 16:13.880
Oh, please.
It's all flash.

16:14.790 --> 16:16.290
(shrieks)

16:17.330 --> 16:18.830
(thuds)

16:23.080 --> 16:24.210
Steamer:
Ow!

16:24.210 --> 16:27.040
Those were
load-bearing legs!

16:27.040 --> 16:29.580
-Baymax, nice!
-(groans)

16:29.580 --> 16:33.540
Okay, you got the power, Red,
but you got the endurance?

16:33.540 --> 16:34.670
Oh, no.

16:39.380 --> 16:40.710
(thudding)

16:42.380 --> 16:44.500
(beeping)

16:45.460 --> 16:48.210
Baymax:
You're so fast.
Look at you go.

16:51.210 --> 16:53.540
Aw, baby fall down!

16:53.540 --> 16:55.920
Baymax:
Time for nap-nap!

16:55.920 --> 16:58.080
No substitute
for a bad attitude.

16:58.080 --> 17:02.210
We've still got it.
(cackling)

17:02.210 --> 17:05.080
(cackling)

17:05.080 --> 17:07.380
(both cackling)

17:07.380 --> 17:09.380
Are you actually competing
for the last laugh?

17:09.380 --> 17:11.710
-We'll finish this later.
-Agreed.

17:11.710 --> 17:13.080
(cackles)
I win!

17:13.080 --> 17:14.920
I give this trap a C-minus.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.040
Oh, we're not through yet.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.620
This was just the trap's
preamble.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.920
Supersonic Sue:
With Big Hero 6 on the ropes,
Boss Awesome will be forced

17:22.920 --> 17:25.500
to come here
to save you nitwits.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.620
Steamer:
But he won't expect
Supersonic Sue,

17:27.620 --> 17:31.750
and Baron Von Steamer
to be fighting side-by-side!

17:31.750 --> 17:35.120
-And finally...
-Both: We'll have our revenge!

17:35.120 --> 17:38.920
-(both cackle)
-Steamer:
Wait, who's the cowboy?

17:38.920 --> 17:41.250
Fred's Dad:
Hey, this isn't
my first rodeo.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.830
I said that just
five minutes ago!
Didn't I just say that?

17:44.830 --> 17:49.170
But not just like this.
Now the quip has layers.

17:49.170 --> 17:51.170
Both:
Boss Awesome!

17:51.170 --> 17:53.710
-Dad!
-Good to see you,
too, son.

17:53.710 --> 17:57.960
-That is you in there, right?
-Fred: Yeah. Oh, and BT-dubs,
this is a trap.

17:57.960 --> 18:01.120
I knew you couldn't resist
a classic villain team-up.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.330
You know me too well,
Susie.

18:03.330 --> 18:05.500
So you know
I'm not gonna
let you win.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.250
Ha! You'll never beat
the two of us. Mostly
because of me.

18:09.250 --> 18:13.080
But also because you've
been out of the game,
Boss Dinosaur!

18:13.080 --> 18:15.080
She's right, Dad.
It's been a while
since you were in

18:15.080 --> 18:18.210
an over-the-top,
climatic superhero
fight! Be careful!

18:18.210 --> 18:20.290
Thanks, kids,
but I got this.

18:20.290 --> 18:22.290
-Ah!
-Let's tango!

18:23.330 --> 18:24.790
(Supersonic Sue cackles)

18:32.380 --> 18:34.000
(grunting)

18:37.540 --> 18:38.960
(grunts)

18:44.290 --> 18:46.170
(steam hissing)

18:46.170 --> 18:47.880
(grunts)

18:52.170 --> 18:53.750
(shouts)

18:58.500 --> 19:00.880
I call this one
"The Blender."

19:02.960 --> 19:05.000
(Steamer yelling)

19:06.580 --> 19:10.250
Oh, yeah? Well,
I call this one
"The Flying Squirrel!"

19:11.250 --> 19:14.330
-(electricity crackling)
-(exploding)

19:14.330 --> 19:15.880
-(cackling)
-(crackling)

19:15.880 --> 19:19.580
Prepare to be defeated
by your real number-one enemy.

19:20.380 --> 19:23.880
-(steam hissing)
-(yelling)

19:24.620 --> 19:26.670
(yawns)

19:26.670 --> 19:30.500
There's only room for one
Boss Awesome number one enemy,

19:30.500 --> 19:34.170
and that one is me! (cackling)

19:34.170 --> 19:36.500
Fred's Dad:
Hammer Swing.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.790
Fred: Whoa!
Nice one, Dad.

19:38.790 --> 19:42.420
The inverted hammer.
It never fails.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.460
-You know, I gotta
thank you, skater tot.
-Oh, yeah? For what?

19:49.460 --> 19:52.960
Inspiring me to lace up
after all these years.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.080
I saw you tearin' it up
on the news, and I knew
I had some skate left in me.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.420
-Supersonic Sue me,
why don't ya?
-Ha-ha. Nice.

20:00.420 --> 20:04.540
Let's do this again sometime.
Say, 10 to 20 years?

20:04.540 --> 20:06.790
Ha-ha.
Classic.

20:06.790 --> 20:10.580
Settle one thing.
Which of us
is your arch enemy?

20:10.580 --> 20:13.540
My arch enemy?
Cabbage soup.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.920
I love it.
It doesn't love me.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.830
No...!

20:17.830 --> 20:20.120
Baymax (imitating):
No...!

20:20.120 --> 20:21.330
Right?

20:21.330 --> 20:25.040
Well, there's just
one more thing
to wrap up.

20:25.040 --> 20:28.500
Richardson: I know
you guys didn't think
I could pull it off.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.750
Well, get ready
to be amazed.

20:30.750 --> 20:34.170
Meet the newest addition
to my Captain Fancy collection.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.080
Okay, who's hungry for pizza?

20:38.080 --> 20:41.040
Anchovies?
Not again, Christopher.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.460
Oh! Good idea, Hector.
I'll go see if we have
any coupons.

20:44.460 --> 20:48.880
Oh, don't worry, Brittany.
We'll get a gluten-free
option. (giggles)

20:59.290 --> 21:01.170
Mini-Max:
Was vengeance served?

21:01.170 --> 21:04.080
I do not detect
your prized
undergarments.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.170
No, Mini-Max. Mole
needs those underpants
a lot more than I do.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.460
Turns out he collects
to fill a friendship void.

21:11.460 --> 21:15.420
(sighs) I felt bad
for the little jerk,
so I let him keep them.

21:15.420 --> 21:19.920
-Mini-Max:
Your nobility is immense!
-It's like my dad says:

21:19.920 --> 21:23.960
a real hero helps
everyone in need,
even his enemies.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.830
Mini-Max:
Help an enemy?

21:25.830 --> 21:28.290
You have blown
my mind!

21:28.290 --> 21:30.330
(laughing)

21:30.330 --> 21:32.830
I am in need of repair.

21:38.750 --> 21:40.750
(theme music playing)
