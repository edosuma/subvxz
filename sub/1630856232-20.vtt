08:47.360 --> 08:49.696
I've done a lot
of the big, belty songs.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.990
And this one really
strips it all down.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.742
It's my first sad song.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.036
I can't wait to show
that side of me.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.246
* It's a quarter
after one *

08:58.288 --> 08:59.998
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity

09:00.040 --> 09:02.083
to still be here
for playoffs.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.960
Back home,
I produce all my own music,

09:04.002 --> 09:07.505
so I write the songs on
my guitar, record my own vocal.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.382
I'll edit that,
send it for mixing.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.884
It's a lot of steps,

09:10.925 --> 09:13.345
but I love being a part
of every single aspect of it.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.014
* Said I wouldn't call *
To be able to make it to lives

09:16.056 --> 09:18.558
would be a statement
to myself of,

09:18.600 --> 09:20.602
I hustled, I kept grinding.

09:20.643 --> 09:24.314
I really want to prove to John
that I do deserve to be here,

09:24.356 --> 09:27.400
and I want to make him proud
for taking on a country girl.

09:27.442 --> 09:29.277
* I just need you *

09:29.319 --> 09:30.904
John: I know Kristen's
a great vocalist,

09:30.945 --> 09:32.697
and she's proving it
in this rehearsal.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.783
This song crossed over
to all the charts,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.242
and I feel like this
is a great song

09:36.284 --> 09:38.411
for Kristen to make a statement
in the playoffs.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.537
Yes!
Whew!

09:39.579 --> 09:40.872
That was really good.
Thank you.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.123
You kind of dipped back
into your false

09:42.165 --> 09:43.958
once you had gotten big.
At that point,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.126
I don't wanna hear you
really singing the false.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.836
At like the very end?
Yeah. Yeah.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.296
Okay, perfect. Cool.
But I think it's
a good, like,

09:48.338 --> 09:50.173
journey throughout the song,
where it feels like

09:50.215 --> 09:51.883
you're building intensity
and keep going.
Thank you.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.635
If you sing it like what
you're doing now in rehearsal,

09:53.677 --> 09:56.221
you're going to be great.
Thank you so much
for everything.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.139
Alright. My pleasure.
Yay!

09:58.181 --> 10:00.809
She's new on my team,
and this is the last time

10:00.850 --> 10:03.770
when the coaches have
the decision-making power.

10:03.812 --> 10:06.314
After this, the audience
is going to decide.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.483
So, she's going to have to do
something really special

10:08.525 --> 10:12.195
to stand out and compete with
all these Team Legend members.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.114

Niall, what'd you think
of that performance?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.588
That song is absolutely
perfect for you.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.132
Thank you so much.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.967
To hold your breath
and have enough breath control

12:39.009 --> 12:40.719
at that octave
is quite tough.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.971
And you smashed both
of those first opening lines.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.305
Unbelievable job.
Thank you.

in your voice

and just the power
at the end,

12:53.023 --> 12:54.649
everything about
the performance was perfect.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.194

over you right now.

Coach Reba.

You made all the country folks
very proud.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.036
Thank you!
Oh!

13:06.077 --> 13:08.038
You represented
country music so well.

to the top.

Absolutely.

what'd you think?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.715
John:
I stole you for a reason.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.051
And this was just
another level.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.553
Having the finesse
and the breath control

13:23.595 --> 13:26.598
to do what you did early in
the song and be just flawless,

13:26.639 --> 13:29.142
we were all looking
at each other like, "Wow."

13:29.184 --> 13:31.519

perfectly executed.

Kristen, the way she sang
the lower notes,

13:38.735 --> 13:41.863
it was with such skill
and finesse, she nailed it.

13:41.905 --> 13:45.742
Both Kristen and Azán have given
their best performance to date.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.452

tough to decide.

Fantastic.

a heavy contender.

I hope John puts her through.

From what I've seen so far,
Team Legend's incredible.

It's going to be hard
for John to pick three.

I love her.
That was so pretty.
She killed it.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.175
She did little things
with her voice on the high notes

going to go,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.011
Thank you, Reba.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.180
Daly: Niall.
Every time you try
something different,

18:59.222 --> 19:00.682
it's always really good.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.726
And to be 17 years old
and to have,

19:02.767 --> 19:04.936
"Oh, come on, give me any song.
I'll sing it."

19:04.978 --> 19:08.440
[ Laughter ]
Like, you've made
John's decision very difficult.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.817
John, what did you hear
in Kaylee's performance

19:10.859 --> 19:12.861
that stuck out?
John: It really is phenomenal

19:12.902 --> 19:15.030
that you are the age
that you are

19:15.071 --> 19:19.576
and your voice has this much
control and depth and range.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.953
Your low voice
is really gorgeous.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.413
I love the warmth in it.

19:23.455 --> 19:25.623
And then, the fact
that you can do all of that

19:25.665 --> 19:28.585
and then go to those notes
in the stratosphere

19:28.626 --> 19:30.545
that almost no one
on the planet can hit,

19:30.587 --> 19:31.755
you're ready for this.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.423
You're ready to be
a big star.

19:33.465 --> 19:34.758
You're so special,
Kaylee.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.843
Thank you, John.
Thank you.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.386
How about another big hand
for Kaylee Shimizu,

19:38.428 --> 19:39.804
ladies and gentlemen!

19:39.846 --> 19:41.931
Kaylee, you know,
we've all been raving about her

19:41.973 --> 19:42.974
since the beginning.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.351
She just has a supremely

19:44.392 --> 19:45.935
out-of-this-world gift.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.104
She's the kind of talent
that always

19:48.146 --> 19:50.440
does well on "The Voice."

19:50.482 --> 19:51.816
Thank you.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.110
This is going to be
so hard to decide.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.321
We're going to choose
three artists out of six,

19:56.363 --> 19:57.739
and all of them
are so talented.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.866
So, what I'm going
to be looking for

19:59.908 --> 20:02.369
is who really steps up
in these big moments.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.204
Hello, Kaylee.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.331
The anticipation leading up

20:06.373 --> 20:08.625
to his decision
is nerve-racking.

20:08.667 --> 20:13.088
I'm still a little nervous,
'cause you just don't know.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.798
Wow, John.
John:
Tough stuff here.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.550
You got a great team.
Wow.

20:24.182 --> 20:25.308
* This is "The Voice" *

20:25.350 --> 20:28.395
Daly: Welcome back
to the playoffs.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.063
Niall: We've got
our finalists.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.189
John...
Um...

20:31.231 --> 20:32.440
...you're up.
Oh, it's me.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.943
Have you got any idea
where you're leaning?

20:34.984 --> 20:37.445
I'm always allowing myself
to pay attention

20:37.487 --> 20:40.407
to how people deliver
in this high-pressure moment.
Yeah. Fair.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.951
John: Reba, this is
gonna be your first
live shows coming up soon.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.370
Are you ready?
I'm a little nervous
about it.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.914
You don't have to make
any more decisions.
But then,
that's the scary thing

20:47.956 --> 20:50.041
about the lives too.
That is the scary thing
about it.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.251
They're my babies.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.169
Who wants to go and see
Johnny Boy suffer?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.671
Yay!
Come on!

20:54.713 --> 20:55.714
Hey!

20:56.840 --> 20:59.009
John: Taylor,
you're back.
Taylor: Hi.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.262
You were my one and only save
in the knockouts.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.638
[ Speaks indistinctly ]

21:03.680 --> 21:05.682
John: I had to save Taylor.
She's so good.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.183
I've loved her since the blinds.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.102
Taylor brings that sweet,

21:09.144 --> 21:11.021
soulful power in her voice.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.398
I'm excited for you
to sing Oleta Adams now.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.025
Thank you so much.
Yes.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.568
At this point
in the competition,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.862
what else
could you be looking for

21:18.903 --> 21:21.156
in this performance
to help me elevate it?

21:21.197 --> 21:22.866
Everybody can sing
who's in the playoffs.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.410
The real question is,
who can connect to the audience?

21:25.452 --> 21:28.580
We want to feel your passion.
We want to feel your emotion.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.582
We want to feel your connection
to the song.

21:30.623 --> 21:34.044
* You can reach me
by railway *

21:34.085 --> 21:36.921
Mm-hmm.
Taylor: I'm singing "Get Here"
by Oleta Adams.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.591
My boyfriend and I were
in a long-distance relationship.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.760
We would go months
without seeing each other.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.637
When I sing this song,
I can't help but think about

21:44.679 --> 21:47.182
all the heartache and longing
that went into that.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.641
We took that leap of faith,

21:48.683 --> 21:51.478
and it's turned into something
really beautiful.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.938
* Just get here
if you can *

21:53.980 --> 21:56.608
I am so proud of you
for chasing your dreams.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.234
And I want you to know
that I love you so much,

21:58.276 --> 21:59.944
and I miss you so much.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.073
* Can *

22:03.114 --> 22:05.325
Yes. Beautiful.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.160
You sound so good.
Thank you.

22:07.202 --> 22:10.914
There's occasions when
I think you run off of the note

22:10.955 --> 22:14.417
more than holding it out,
and I feel like I prefer,

22:14.459 --> 22:15.835
most of the time,
you hold it out.

22:15.877 --> 22:18.296
Okay.
It just feels more
connected emotionally.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.631
On the...

22:19.673 --> 22:22.133
* You can reach me
with your mind *

22:22.175 --> 22:23.760
...I really think
you should sing that melody

22:23.802 --> 22:25.261
the original way
she sings it,

22:25.303 --> 22:27.180
'cause, right now,
you're doing a run off of that.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.557
Together:
* Reach me with your mind *

I really think that melody is,
like, so special in that moment

22:33.186 --> 22:34.521
that I would like
to hear it.
Okay.

Everything else
sounds so good.

anything to make it to lives.

Working with him
has been incredible,

22:42.320 --> 22:44.114
and I just want to keep going.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.657
Beautiful.
Alright.

22:45.699 --> 22:48.326
I don't have any saves now,
so I can't save her this time.

22:48.368 --> 22:51.246
It's going to be about
who are my top-three artists

22:51.287 --> 22:52.247

a little bit of spice there.

for your voice.

Lila's singing
"Angel From Montgomery,"

27:16.177 --> 27:18.138
right up her alley
as a vocalist.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.016
Lila's voice is subtle.
She doesn't over-sing.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.977

just got to keep going
in that classic lane.

to be singing this song.

It's what I love about music.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.318
It's really a community-
and heart-based song

27:32.360 --> 27:36.489
that makes me feel centered
and grounded.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.825
I feel like my parents
really gave me that

27:38.867 --> 27:40.243
as I was growing up.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.079
They taught me how to be humble
and to work hard,

27:43.121 --> 27:46.708
but also see yourself
being successful.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.209
Making it to the live shows,

27:48.251 --> 27:50.003
it would mean so much to me,
because it would show

27:50.045 --> 27:52.047
that I'm a real contender, so...

I think the goal would be
give it enough drama by the end

27:59.429 --> 28:02.349
that it feels like
a full journey of a performance.

28:02.390 --> 28:04.100
Even though
it's a chill vibe,

28:04.142 --> 28:07.103

too subdued at the end.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.540
Yeah.
The key with this song

28:27.582 --> 28:30.877
is not to try to out-belt
the other artists,

28:30.919 --> 28:32.212
but put your own stamp on it

28:32.253 --> 28:34.047
and show us
some passion as well.

28:34.089 --> 28:36.216
You're killing it.
Thank you.

28:36.257 --> 28:39.386
With "Angel From Montgomery,"
here's Lila Forde.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.680

Let's go, Lila!

30:39.172 --> 30:42.008
Hey!
Oh, yeah. Whoo!

30:42.050 --> 30:45.136
Daly: Give it up for Lila Forde,
ladies and gentlemen!

30:45.178 --> 30:48.515
I love her so much!
Great job. Niall, let's get
some thoughts from you.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.934
Hello, producers. Can I have
another steal, please?

30:50.975 --> 30:52.352
[ Laughter ]

30:52.394 --> 30:56.731
Um, you're incredible.
Your runs were so flavorful.

30:56.773 --> 30:58.483
Your lower register
is really nice.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.485
When you get up there,
it's really pretty.

31:00.527 --> 31:04.155
You are one of my favorite acts
I've seen on "The Voice."

31:04.197 --> 31:05.782
Thank you.
It means a lot.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.534
This is high praise, Niall.

31:07.575 --> 31:10.078
Oh, you know how much
I love Lila Forde.
We love to see it.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.454
We love to see it.
Daly: Coach Gwen.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.039
Gwen: Your style
is sort of reminiscent

31:13.081 --> 31:16.084
of almost like
a '70s vibe,

31:16.126 --> 31:17.669
but it doesn't feel like
you're copying it.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.422
It flows through you
so naturally and authentically

31:20.463 --> 31:25.176
that it's exciting for someone
like me to see a young girl

31:25.218 --> 31:27.512
that feels so authentic
and pure.

31:27.554 --> 31:30.181
I'm a big fan.
Oh, my goodness.
Thank you so much.

31:30.223 --> 31:31.307
Coach Reba,
what'd you think?

31:31.349 --> 31:32.976
You've got
a little category

31:33.018 --> 31:34.477
over here by yourself.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.855
I just love the little
inflections in your voice.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.273
It's the complete package.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.233
You got to pick her.
You see that, John?

31:40.275 --> 31:41.526
What did you think
of the performance?

31:41.568 --> 31:43.486
You just have
a certain light about you

31:43.528 --> 31:47.532
that makes you very individual
with a real sense of identity.

31:47.574 --> 31:51.578
The runs you do make these
classic songs sound more modern,

31:51.619 --> 31:53.872
but they don't take you
out of the spirit of the song.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.540
It's like really fresh...
Yeah, exactly.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.917
...but it's classic
at the same time,

31:57.959 --> 31:59.669
and I'm -- I'm just thrilled
to work with you.

31:59.711 --> 32:02.088
I'm thrilled to work with you.
Thank you, John.

32:02.130 --> 32:04.424
Lila Forde,
ladies and gentlemen!

32:04.466 --> 32:07.218
Lila Forde,
what could have been?

32:07.260 --> 32:08.595
Outside of my team,

32:08.636 --> 32:10.096
the best there is
in this competition.

32:10.138 --> 32:14.476
I am in awe of everything
she brings to this competition.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.394
Oh, my God, she's something
special, huh?
She's so cool.

32:16.436 --> 32:19.647
So good.
Niall's in love.
Oh, my God.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.483
If John moves her forward
to the live shows,

32:21.524 --> 32:24.069
she's definitely
a threat to Team Niall --

32:24.110 --> 32:25.779
a threat that I'm okay with.

32:26.863 --> 32:29.699
John: You were the talk
of the knockouts.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.284
It was incredible.

32:31.326 --> 32:32.952
Daly: Mac, congratulations!

32:32.994 --> 32:36.956
Mac, I was really glad John
stole him in the battle rounds,

32:36.998 --> 32:40.794
because if anybody can take him
on to the top, it is John.

32:40.835 --> 32:44.297
I think Mac could be a huge
contender to win this thing.

32:44.339 --> 32:45.715
Come on home, bro.
Mac: Come on.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.301
John: Mac is one of
my favorite R&B voices.

32:48.343 --> 32:51.971
He has such range,
such character, such texture.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.183
I could see him
actually being an R&B star.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.768
So, we picked
this song...
Yes.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.229
...D'Angelo's "Untitled"...
Yes. Yeah.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.314
...and I could just
see you destroying it.

33:01.356 --> 33:02.774
I'm gonna make it do
what it do, baby.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.359
Make it do what it do.
[ Laughs ]

33:04.401 --> 33:09.572
* How does it feel, baby? *

33:09.614 --> 33:10.740
Yeah!

33:10.782 --> 33:12.784
Mac: I heard this song
for the first time

33:12.826 --> 33:15.578
when I was around
13 or 14 years old,

33:15.620 --> 33:17.539
and it started my love
for R&B.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.375
* How does it feel, baby? *
I grew up in a very
religious household,

33:20.417 --> 33:24.212
so the whole R&B thing
is not a thing at the house.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.047
So I had to kind of,
like, sneak off.

33:26.089 --> 33:27.507
I'm sorry, Mama, but, uh,

33:27.549 --> 33:30.510
I knew for a fact
I needed to sing for a living.

33:30.552 --> 33:34.055
Together: * 'Cause I wanna
take the walls down *

33:34.097 --> 33:36.307
Mac: Just being one step away
from the lives

33:36.349 --> 33:39.644
and having an artist like John
as my coach,

33:39.686 --> 33:41.604
what else could you ask for?

33:41.646 --> 33:44.524
* How does it feel? *
So, I have to make sure

33:44.566 --> 33:46.776
that he's pleased
with the performance.

33:46.818 --> 33:49.738
Yeah. So, I saw you
were ad-libbing on
the first few lines,

33:49.779 --> 33:51.865
which I think works
really well.

33:51.906 --> 33:52.824
On the last couple,

33:52.866 --> 33:54.325
that's when you sing
the lyric...

33:54.367 --> 33:59.122
* How does it feel? *

33:59.164 --> 34:01.166
* Yeah *
I got you.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.543
When you're singing the hook,
it connects you to the song

34:03.585 --> 34:05.545
with more fullness
and authority.
Yeah.

34:05.587 --> 34:08.840
Think about what this song
should feel like.

34:08.882 --> 34:12.052
They were recording this
at Electric Lady Studios.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.928
This is where Jimi Hendrix
used to record.

34:13.970 --> 34:16.639
And D'Angelo has
that church background,

34:16.681 --> 34:18.683
so you want to hear
that gospel energy.
Yeah.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.561
There was also, like,
this rock 'n' roll energy too.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.646
So, if you combine
all that together,

34:23.688 --> 34:24.856
that's when
you'll nail it.

34:24.898 --> 34:26.733
John: This song
is so powerful,

34:26.775 --> 34:28.735
and it's got such edge to it.

34:28.777 --> 34:30.862
It's going to be great.
I want to hear Mac

34:30.904 --> 34:33.031
give a sexy...
I can't wait.

34:33.073 --> 34:37.827
...rock 'n' roll performance
and sing himself into the lives.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.251

Gwen, what did you think?

37:20.615 --> 37:22.659
I'm literally blown away
right now.

37:22.701 --> 37:25.203
That is a star
standing next to you, Carson.

37:25.245 --> 37:26.621
Oh!
Thank you.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.332
I loved everything about
the way you were on stage,

37:29.374 --> 37:31.251
your body language,
the way you're dressed.

37:31.292 --> 37:34.129
It was perfect.
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

Reba: Mac, you have grown
leaps and bounds.

37:37.507 --> 37:40.844
I'm so proud of you. I know
your grandma would be, too.

37:40.885 --> 37:43.722
Oh, man, don't do that
to me, Reba.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.265
Niall, I know you got
a lot to say.

37:45.306 --> 37:48.143
Oh, my God, what just happened?
That was insane.

37:48.184 --> 37:51.730
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Honestly, like,
all of your instincts,

37:51.771 --> 37:53.648
the way you, like,
answered yourself back

37:53.690 --> 37:55.817
in a different tone,
is so tasteful.

37:55.859 --> 37:57.986
I felt like I was watching
the grand finale

37:58.028 --> 38:00.655
and America were just about
to pick up the phone and vote,

38:00.697 --> 38:02.532
'cause, wow, that was
different level, Mac.

38:02.574 --> 38:04.534
Johnny Boy,
he has to go through.

38:04.576 --> 38:05.952
Thank you, thank you.

38:05.994 --> 38:08.288
You know,
I've been making R&B music

38:08.329 --> 38:10.415
for decades now,

38:10.457 --> 38:13.293
and I just put you
right up there with the best

38:13.335 --> 38:14.669
that I've ever been around.

38:14.711 --> 38:16.838
I feel like you are
the complete package

38:16.880 --> 38:18.965
of what R&B music
needs right now.

38:19.007 --> 38:20.550
And when you
came to my team,

38:20.592 --> 38:23.970
I just felt like I understood
you and I believed in you,

38:24.012 --> 38:27.390
and you're just rewarding
that leap of faith that I took,

38:27.432 --> 38:28.850
stealing you back then.

38:28.892 --> 38:31.770
I'm ready to hear a Mac record,
like, right now.

38:31.811 --> 38:33.146
I'm just thrilled
to work with you.

38:33.188 --> 38:34.981

Gwen:
Mac is just incredible.

38:39.235 --> 38:42.238
Why is he not signed?
He reminds me a lot of Usher.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.409
We haven't had an artist in the
world like Mac in a long time.

38:46.451 --> 38:47.619
Yes, sir.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.038
I really hate to say it,
but Team Legend

38:50.080 --> 38:51.289
is stacked up.

38:51.331 --> 38:54.209
The talent on that team
is unbelievable.

38:54.250 --> 38:55.543
It's really diverse.

38:55.585 --> 38:57.629
It's got so many different types
of singers on it.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.714
[ Inhales sharply ] Danger.

38:59.756 --> 39:02.217
This is a tough decision
for John.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.968
I'm glad I don't have
to make it.

39:04.010 --> 39:05.845
I've been deliberating.
Gwen: Did your calculations?

39:05.887 --> 39:07.597
Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop.

from Team Legend.

39:14.396 --> 39:16.898
All six brought it tonight.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.900
You have a really,
really proud coach over there

39:18.942 --> 39:21.403
who's got an absolutely crushing
decision to make here.

39:21.444 --> 39:23.029
John, how are you feeling?

39:23.071 --> 39:27.909
I'm so torn. You're just
so absolutely talented.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.994
And it's been an honor to work
with all six of you.

39:30.036 --> 39:31.955
-Thank you.
-Thank you, John
-Thank you so much.

39:31.996 --> 39:34.416
John, congratulations.
It's the dream team.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.334
Your team's been awesome.
Yeah.

39:36.376 --> 39:37.585
Alright.

Who is the first artist
moving on?

39:39.546 --> 39:44.092

The first artist
moving on...

39:47.053 --> 39:49.431

Mac advancing to the Top 12!

39:54.436 --> 39:55.854
Congratulations!

39:55.895 --> 39:57.188
John: I can't stop
raving about Mac.

39:57.230 --> 39:59.315
I really want
to hear his record.

39:59.357 --> 40:01.609
I want to see him
on the biggest stages.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.945
I feel like R&B needs Mac.

40:03.987 --> 40:06.114
I want him to get signed,
like, yesterday.

40:06.156 --> 40:07.449
I loved it.
I'm proud of you.

40:07.490 --> 40:08.700
And I am so excited

the next artist moving on?

40:17.250 --> 40:22.547

[ Cheers and applause ]
Lila, you are in the Top 12!

40:32.182 --> 40:35.268
John: I chose Lila because she's
been magical every single round.

40:35.310 --> 40:37.020
No one else like her
in the competition.

40:37.062 --> 40:38.146
Yeah.

40:38.188 --> 40:39.939
She's got such confidence
and presence,

40:39.981 --> 40:41.608
and I think that's really rare.

40:41.649 --> 40:45.070
Lila's future is so bright
on "The Voice" and beyond.

40:45.111 --> 40:47.113
Daly: John, four artists left.
God, they're all good.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.990
So cute.
You can only pick one

40:49.032 --> 40:50.825
to complete our entire Top 12.

40:50.867 --> 40:52.702
The rest will be
leaving us tonight.

40:52.744 --> 40:54.662
Who is your last artist
moving on?

All of you
are so deserving,

40:56.873 --> 41:00.251
and each of you
has a future in this business.

41:00.293 --> 41:02.837

the "Voice" Top 12

41:18.853 --> 41:20.980

My super save, Azán,
rose to the occasion

41:23.900 --> 41:25.694
and gave her
best performance yet.

41:25.735 --> 41:27.153
I love you. Thank you.
You earned it.

41:27.195 --> 41:30.990
This performance of "Adorn"
was literally flawless.

41:31.032 --> 41:34.494
I had to reward her
by putting her into the lives.
