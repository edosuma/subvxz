WEBVTT

00:26.750 --> 00:28.875
<i>Hello, good morning, how you doing?</i>

00:28.957 --> 00:31.375
<i>Waking up, shaking yesterday's blues, yeah</i>

00:31.458 --> 00:34.250
<i>Turn the TV off
it's bad news, man</i>

00:34.334 --> 00:37.000
<i>Feeling fresh
like a Ziploc new man</i>

00:37.082 --> 00:39.707
<i>OJ with a champagne tune-up</i>

00:39.790 --> 00:42.334
<i>Mimosa Holy Ghost
running through ya</i>

00:42.417 --> 00:44.375
<i>"Hell yeah"
is the new "hallelujah"</i>

00:44.459 --> 00:46.500
<i>Popping like
the top off a bottle</i>

00:46.582 --> 00:47.707
<i>And I ain't stopping, yeah</i>

00:47.790 --> 00:50.334
<i>Baby, it's a brand-new day</i>

00:50.417 --> 00:52.582
<i>Ain't no clouds
hanging over me</i>

00:52.665 --> 00:55.417
<i>Something doesn't feel the same</i>

00:55.707 --> 00:57.957
<i>The rest of my life
gonna start today</i>

00:58.042 --> 01:00.832
- <i>Good morning</i>
- <i>Na na na na</i>

01:00.917 --> 01:03.292
- <i>Good morning</i>
- <i>Na na na na</i>

01:03.375 --> 01:06.125
- <i>Good morning</i>
- <i>Na na na na</i>

01:06.207 --> 01:08.750
<i>The rest of my life
gonna start today</i>

01:08.832 --> 01:11.334
<i>I've been up
I've been down</i>

01:11.417 --> 01:13.790
<i>But I got
the feeling right now</i>

01:13.875 --> 01:16.832
<i>I've been up
I've been down</i>

01:16.917 --> 01:19.209
<i>Do you got
the feeling right now?</i>

01:20.082 --> 01:22.209
<i>Baby, it's a brand-new day</i>

01:22.292 --> 01:24.125
<i>Ain't no clouds
hanging over me...</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.957
This year's gonna suck.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.750
How do you know that?

01:30.917 --> 01:32.625
Oops. That happened.

01:34.625 --> 01:35.665
Call it a hunch.

01:39.082 --> 01:40.250
Ew.

01:40.957 --> 01:42.540
Last year,
we were kings.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.250
Fifth-graders.
We ruled that school.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.707
This year,
nobody likes us.

01:47.790 --> 01:49.000
That is true.

01:49.082 --> 01:51.000
Speak for yourself.
I'll be fine.

01:51.082 --> 01:52.917
I got a mustache coming in.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.790
- I don't see it.
- Nope.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.956
- Mmm-mmm.
- Nope.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.540
- Uh-uh.
- No one's got it worse than me.

02:01.417 --> 02:02.665
See that girl over there?

02:02.832 --> 02:05.292
She's gonna torture me
every chance she gets.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.209
Wait a sec.
Isn't that your sister?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.539
Yeah.

02:09.875 --> 02:11.707
At least you guys
have your own rooms.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.250
My grandfather stole mine.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.459
Wait. Your grandpa
moved in with you guys?

02:15.540 --> 02:16.625
When did that happen?

02:16.790 --> 02:18.790
Ever since he robbed
that grocery store.

02:32.540 --> 02:33.582
Can I help you, sir?

02:34.209 --> 02:36.792
- You can help me find Maria.
- Oh, Maria's gone.

02:36.875 --> 02:38.540
We're completely
self-checkout now.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.209
Much faster.
Much more efficient.

02:40.292 --> 02:41.417
I think you'll like it.

02:41.707 --> 02:42.957
So, are the prices
gonna be lower

02:43.042 --> 02:44.250
because I'm doing
all the work now?

02:44.334 --> 02:46.250
We have everyday
low prices here, sir.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.875
- Every day.
- Every day?

02:47.957 --> 02:49.707
- Every day.
- Get out of my way. Get out of my way.

02:49.957 --> 02:51.167
Oh, no problem.

02:51.957 --> 02:53.000
Whoa!

02:53.082 --> 02:54.875
<i>Please scan your item.</i>

02:54.957 --> 02:56.457
I'm talking to a robot.

02:56.540 --> 02:58.000
<i>Please scan your item.</i>

02:58.082 --> 02:59.082
I just did.

03:01.292 --> 03:02.457
See if this thing...

03:03.875 --> 03:05.292
<i>Please scan your item.</i>

03:05.375 --> 03:06.417
You're very boring.

03:07.125 --> 03:08.375
<i>Please scan your item.</i>

03:08.457 --> 03:09.500
Yeah, right.

03:15.792 --> 03:17.042
Sir!

03:17.707 --> 03:18.707
Sir?

03:18.792 --> 03:21.457
Sir, I need you to stop. Hey!

03:21.540 --> 03:23.415
Whoa! Oh, hey!

03:24.625 --> 03:26.000
Sir, let me help you.

03:26.084 --> 03:28.415
- You hurt my leg! Get away!
- Come on, sir.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.457
Get out of the way!
I'm a senior citizen!

03:30.540 --> 03:32.375
- Get out of here!
- I know judo.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.125
Leave that
poor man alone!

03:36.167 --> 03:38.209
- Whoa!
- Your pharmacy stinks!

03:41.042 --> 03:42.582
- You're ageist!
- Oh, I see.

03:42.665 --> 03:44.167
Y'all want to bring it on.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.707
You want to bring it on?

03:46.582 --> 03:48.167
- Treat us with respect!
- Oh!

03:49.415 --> 03:51.415
That's all you got?

03:51.500 --> 03:53.250
Now, that hurt.

03:58.167 --> 03:59.625
Hey, there's my girl.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.250
You didn't have to come
all this way.

04:01.334 --> 04:02.334
I told you I was fine.

04:02.415 --> 04:03.832
What happened
to the mailbox?

04:05.082 --> 04:07.167
Oh, that.
Some idiot took it out.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.167
Oh, crap.

04:14.917 --> 04:16.791
Dad, you're driving again,
aren't you?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.665
You lost your license,
remember?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.832
No, I didn't lose it.
I forgot to renew it.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.375
So now I have to
retake the test again, which is idiotic

04:23.457 --> 04:25.292
because I've been driving
for over 50 years.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.292
I mean, what am I supposed to do,
starve to death?

04:27.375 --> 04:28.375
I'm coming in.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.167
This can't keep happening.

04:36.665 --> 04:39.084
Don't worry, I'm never going back
to that damn store again.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.415
No, I mean the part about,

04:40.500 --> 04:42.292
I have to leave
the dealership early,

04:42.375 --> 04:44.625
drive two hours each way
just to check on you.

04:44.707 --> 04:46.042
I didn't ask you to come!

04:46.375 --> 04:48.457
No, you didn't!
The police did.

04:48.707 --> 04:51.084
Dad, I want to come.
I want to be there for you.

04:51.917 --> 04:52.917
But maybe this is

04:53.125 --> 04:55.500
now the time
that we have to consider...

04:55.582 --> 04:57.540
No. I am not moving.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.167
I built this house,

04:59.250 --> 05:01.458
I'm gonna die in this house,
and that's it.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.500
And you're not
putting me in a home.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.750
- What if it were our home?
- What are you talking about?

05:07.833 --> 05:09.833
Fish and relatives
stink after three days.

05:09.916 --> 05:12.166
That's a horrible idea.
We'll kill each other.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.791
It ain't working.
No, sorry.

05:13.875 --> 05:14.875
Dad...

05:21.042 --> 05:22.415
I miss her, too.

05:22.917 --> 05:24.540
And, and that's
not gonna change

05:24.625 --> 05:27.667
by moving me out of my house
and sticking me in yours.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.290
Oh, God.

05:34.707 --> 05:37.500
Well, maybe we could
miss her together.

05:37.582 --> 05:38.917
Yeah, maybe.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.707
But you don't have the room
in your house anyway.

05:40.792 --> 05:42.167
Where would you
even put me?

05:42.375 --> 05:44.415
The attic? No way!

05:44.500 --> 05:47.000
Come on, buddy,
don't make this harder than it already is.

05:47.084 --> 05:48.290
It's the only choice.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.290
Ooh!

05:51.415 --> 05:54.832
Dad, if it's the only choice,
then it isn't a choice at all.

05:55.167 --> 05:58.332
'Cause a choice means you get to pick
between at least two things.

05:58.415 --> 05:59.540
And this is one thing.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.375
Unless the other thing is I get to sleep
in the yard and get eaten by a bear.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.833
Don't be so dramatic, Peter.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.084
Besides, your sisters
already share a room.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.084
Yeah, well,
Sarah told me you said that.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.415
No, I know
she exaggerates, but...

06:10.500 --> 06:12.250
<i>Christmastime is here</i>

06:12.333 --> 06:13.375
<i>Happiness and cheer...</i>

06:13.458 --> 06:14.916
No, you stop.
Hold on. Shh!

06:16.167 --> 06:17.209
Shh!

06:17.582 --> 06:18.917
Shh!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.250
Shh!

06:20.332 --> 06:21.750
- Shh!
- Shh!

06:21.832 --> 06:23.707
- Shh! Shh!
- Shh! Shh!

06:23.792 --> 06:25.000
- Shh!
- Shh!

06:25.625 --> 06:27.250
- Shh!
- Shh!

06:27.332 --> 06:28.959
- Shh!
- Shh! Shh!

06:29.042 --> 06:30.042
Shh!

06:31.167 --> 06:32.167
Hey, what's up?

06:32.457 --> 06:33.540
Shh!

06:33.625 --> 06:35.540
Plus, the attic
doesn't have a bathroom.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.959
<i>And Grandpa
can't do all those stairs.</i>

06:38.415 --> 06:41.540
And the basement...
is the basement.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
What?

06:46.415 --> 06:47.415
My Jordans.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.000
I just put in fresh laces.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.832
Hey, Peter.
Do you need help moving upstairs?

06:51.917 --> 06:53.542
Get out!
It's still my room!

06:54.207 --> 06:55.415
- Hmm.
- Not for long.

06:56.042 --> 06:58.500
Go away!
Go, go, go.

06:59.832 --> 07:02.666
Look, Peter,
I know this is not ideal,

07:02.750 --> 07:04.415
but we're a family,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.750
and you have to make
sacrifices for each other.

07:06.833 --> 07:08.583
Sometimes
very big sacrifices.

07:14.250 --> 07:18.167
Look, sweetheart,
the attic is bigger than this room.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.500
Once you move in,
then that will be your room.

07:20.582 --> 07:21.625
No, it won't.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.375
It'll be the attic,

07:23.457 --> 07:25.207
where you put stuff
and forget it,

07:25.290 --> 07:26.625
just like our old TV,

07:26.832 --> 07:28.834
or the exercise bike
that Dad used once.

07:29.457 --> 07:32.625
- True.
- I exercise. What?

07:33.375 --> 07:35.582
Look, think about it
as a fresh new start.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.667
All right?
We'll dust everything off,

07:37.750 --> 07:39.625
put some new paint up
everywhere.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.457
Give you a chance to...
clean out your turtle tank.

07:42.582 --> 07:44.375
- Huh?
- They like it like that.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.332
Gives them privacy.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.332
Does this still fit you, sweetie?

07:49.125 --> 07:50.125
Yes.

07:53.959 --> 07:55.042
Grandpa!

07:55.959 --> 07:58.084
<i>Grandpa's here, Grandpa's here</i>

07:58.290 --> 07:59.707
<i>Grandpa all the way</i>

07:59.792 --> 08:05.084
<i>Oh, what fun it is to have
a Grandpa come and stay, hey</i>

08:05.333 --> 08:06.875
Hey! Now, remember,

08:06.959 --> 08:08.916
we don't want to overwhelm
Grandpa, okay?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.541
So let's let him
get settled in.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.583
There'll be plenty of time
to talk to him tonight at dinner. Okay?

08:13.666 --> 08:14.750
Oh, I'm not gonna be here.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.000
- What?
- What? I'm studying with Russell.

08:17.084 --> 08:19.332
"Studying" still means studying, right?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.042
It's not slang
for something else?

08:21.125 --> 08:23.082
No, Dad, "studying"
still means studying.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.959
And I already
cleared it with Mom.

08:27.084 --> 08:29.792
- Grandpa!
- Jenny!

08:29.874 --> 08:31.165
Don't body-slam.

08:34.792 --> 08:37.164
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hello, sweetheart.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.207
- Ed.
- Artie.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.582
Where's your brother?

08:46.457 --> 08:47.875
Peter?

08:47.959 --> 08:48.959
Peter!

08:49.457 --> 08:50.500
Peter?

08:52.457 --> 08:54.582
Kids, let's help, uh,
Grandpa get his bags.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.290
- Okay. I got this.
- I got it.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.750
Okay. It just...
It's right over here.

09:04.750 --> 09:06.250
You know,
he called me Artie again.

09:06.332 --> 09:07.917
Please, Arthur.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.582
This isn't easy for him.

09:17.750 --> 09:18.917
Hey, Grandpa.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.207
Hey! There he is!
Look at you.

09:24.082 --> 09:26.875
Look at you.
You're sprouting up like a weed.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.917
Oh. Nice sneakers.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.207
Thanks.
How do you like your room?

09:32.917 --> 09:34.000
It looks nice.

09:34.082 --> 09:35.582
Yeah, that's 'cause it is nice.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.917
Easily the nicest room
in the house.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
Well, I know, kid.

09:39.582 --> 09:41.667
Look, I didn't want it
to be this way, either.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.332
Sometimes you have to make
sacrifices in a family.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.082
That's true.
You're right.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.917
Sometimes you don't even
get a vote.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.582
That makes two of us.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.375
Careful with
these floorboards.

09:54.917 --> 09:55.917
They're not very level.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.625
I'll remember that.
Thanks, kiddo.

10:01.542 --> 10:02.917
Talk to you later,
Grandpa.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.625
Come visit me
in the attic anytime.

10:09.082 --> 10:11.291
It's the creepy place
with all the spiders and mice.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.417
- Peter!
- I wasn't!

10:33.709 --> 10:34.750
Here we are.

10:39.542 --> 10:40.750
You were robbed, bro.

10:40.834 --> 10:42.457
No. I was invaded.

10:42.542 --> 10:45.457
The worst part is
I'm not even allowed to complain about it.

10:45.542 --> 10:47.709
Seems like you've been
complaining an awful lot, P.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.332
I mean at home,
'cause he's old

10:49.417 --> 10:50.792
and we all love him
and stuff.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.625
Dude, come on, you can't allow
the enemy to invade your base.

10:53.709 --> 10:56.165
You got to fight back
and stick up for your rights.

10:56.250 --> 10:57.332
I don't have rights.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.292
Everyone has rights.
They're in, uh...

11:00.375 --> 11:02.292
Uh, alien-something.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.457
They have to allow you
to pursue happiness.

11:04.542 --> 11:05.792
It's in the Constitution.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.457
Yeah. Well, that would
be great if I lived in North America,

11:08.542 --> 11:10.833
but it turns out that
153 Burlington Avenue

11:10.917 --> 11:13.250
- is actually in North Korea.
- Whoa!

11:14.166 --> 11:16.750
Did your parents know that
when they bought the house?

11:20.125 --> 11:21.166
What?

11:22.166 --> 11:23.875
I wouldn't put up
with this, Petes.

11:23.957 --> 11:26.667
I'd demand my room back,
or else it's war.

11:26.750 --> 11:28.582
What do you mean,
"or else it's war"?

11:28.667 --> 11:30.542
You want him
to attack his grandfather?

11:30.917 --> 11:32.500
Sneak attack, Emma.

11:32.582 --> 11:35.000
See, he can't fight him
the normal way,

11:35.082 --> 11:38.207
because his grandfather has
strength, size and experience,

11:38.375 --> 11:41.165
whereas Peter
is just weak, small and dumb.

11:41.709 --> 11:42.915
You're a bad friend.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.207
Hi, Steven.

11:46.417 --> 11:49.875
Mom says don't forget to wear your
sandals when you shower in gym class.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.625
Not cool, Lisa.

11:53.709 --> 11:57.165
My brother has that toe fungus thing.
It's totally gross.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.583
- And contagious.
- Contagious?

12:01.750 --> 12:05.000
- Gross.
- It's only on six of my toes.

12:05.082 --> 12:07.125
That's a lot of toe, bro.

12:10.375 --> 12:13.542
<i>When you leave me</i>

12:13.957 --> 12:17.082
<i>My world's not alive</i>

12:17.957 --> 12:20.833
<i>You'll be in my days
and nights...</i>

12:22.542 --> 12:25.125
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi, sweetheart.

12:25.207 --> 12:26.542
Do you want
to play a game?

12:26.792 --> 12:29.375
I have <i>Reindeer Run.</i>

12:29.457 --> 12:32.584
I have <i>Santa's World.</i>

12:32.667 --> 12:35.542
I have
<i>1-2-3 Christmas Tree.</i>

12:35.625 --> 12:37.500
Well, maybe,
but not right now, okay?

12:43.082 --> 12:44.332
Want to watch a movie?

12:44.417 --> 12:47.207
I have <i>Frosty the Snowman.</i>

12:47.292 --> 12:49.500
I don't think so,
okay, sweetheart?

12:50.082 --> 12:51.792
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Okay.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.957
What's wrong with Grandpa?

13:00.041 --> 13:02.000
Why? What happened?

13:02.417 --> 13:04.041
He doesn't want
to do anything.

13:04.125 --> 13:07.082
He just stares out the window,
but there's nothing there

13:07.167 --> 13:10.041
except that dead tree
that Daddy says he's gonna cut down.

13:10.125 --> 13:12.082
But you won't let him
use the chain saw.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.542
Daddy can use a chain saw
any time he wants, honey. Okay?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.125
He just chooses to wait
until Mommy says it's okay.

13:21.250 --> 13:25.041
Grandpa will be all right.
He's just tired

13:25.125 --> 13:26.708
and thinking a lot
about Grandma.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.957
- He'll be okay.
- Okay.

13:42.332 --> 13:43.957
Get away from me!

13:54.915 --> 13:56.082
I hate my life.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.750
Oh, come on.

14:24.832 --> 14:26.000
Ow!

14:45.500 --> 14:46.957
"Declaration of War.

14:47.417 --> 14:50.250
"When in the course
of human events

14:50.832 --> 14:52.542
<i>"one person steals</i>

14:53.375 --> 14:55.292
<i>"another person's bedroom,</i>

14:55.375 --> 14:57.750
<i>"there is no other choice
but war.</i>

15:00.082 --> 15:03.875
"You have 24 hours
to give me back what is mine

15:03.957 --> 15:05.957
"or face the consequences.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.042
"Secret Warrior."

15:12.707 --> 15:13.750
Nice handwriting.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.707
It's not bad.
It's just...

15:17.791 --> 15:19.791
You know,
it's an adjustment, so...

15:21.583 --> 15:23.207
- Yeah.
- Who are you talking to?

15:23.292 --> 15:25.625
What? It's Jerry.
I'm just... I'm on the phone.

15:26.042 --> 15:27.082
No, I would love to.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.167
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm sort of stuck here. Yeah.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.750
- Hi, Jerry. It's Sally.
- Hey!

15:33.082 --> 15:34.957
- He's not stuck.
- What are you doing?

15:35.042 --> 15:37.832
Yeah, I'll bring him over
on my way to work. See you soon.

15:38.707 --> 15:39.707
Bye, Jerry.

15:39.790 --> 15:42.832
So, now you're setting me up
on playdates?

15:42.915 --> 15:45.332
Gonna pack me a lunch,
maybe put a note in it?

15:45.417 --> 15:47.750
You want a note?
You might not like what it says.

15:47.832 --> 15:50.000
I'll see him another time.
I'm not up to it.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.832
You haven't seen
Jerry in ages.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.665
Now you live close.
It'll be nice.

15:53.750 --> 15:56.207
I can't, I don't want to,
and I've got stuff to do.

15:56.292 --> 15:58.207
I have to take care
of the light switch

15:58.292 --> 16:02.042
in my room now,
'cause Artie put it in backwards. You did.

16:02.791 --> 16:04.500
Eat up.
We leave in 15 minutes.

16:04.707 --> 16:06.082
Yes, Mom.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.666
How's it going, Grandpa?
Sleep okay?

16:08.916 --> 16:10.292
Like a log, Petey.
Thanks.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.957
- Don't you guys get the paper around here?
- Yeah, we do.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.207
- Here it is.
- Oh, I can't read this.

16:19.625 --> 16:23.042
- Just make it bigger, see?
- Oh, yeah.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.707
- Jen...
- How does she survive?

16:26.791 --> 16:28.875
- She doesn't eat anything.
- I don't know.

16:28.957 --> 16:30.500
- Don't be late, Peter.
- Okay.

16:31.417 --> 16:33.500
So, no nightmares?

16:33.584 --> 16:35.292
- Me? No.
- Insomnia?

16:35.375 --> 16:37.292
Now it's like eight words
on the whole screen.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.915
You don't want
to talk about anything?

16:39.000 --> 16:40.500
I just made
the whole thing disappear.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.125
- I don't know what I did just now.
- Peter, let's go!

16:43.207 --> 16:45.000
Okay, well, if you want
to talk about

16:45.082 --> 16:46.750
something later on,
we can do that.

16:52.167 --> 16:53.250
Okay, have a good day.

16:58.832 --> 16:59.999
He didn't react at all?

17:00.082 --> 17:01.791
Not a word.
What's his game?

17:02.167 --> 17:03.457
What's yours, Pete?

17:03.666 --> 17:04.875
I mean, come on,

17:05.207 --> 17:06.958
you don't start a war
with a note.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.790
Maybe he didn't
actually read it.

17:08.958 --> 17:09.958
He read it.

17:10.165 --> 17:11.833
It was on his desk, unfolded.

17:11.915 --> 17:14.415
Maybe he forgot what he read.
Old people do that.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.040
You do that, Steve.

17:23.833 --> 17:24.833
Oops.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.790
That happened.

17:30.541 --> 17:33.459
But the point is you've already
blown the element of surprise.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.125
You've got to attack immediately.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.000
Um, there's chili in your backpack.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.750
- He knows.
- Yeah.

17:40.208 --> 17:42.334
- Hi, Steven.
- Oh, God, no.

17:42.416 --> 17:44.958
You left your retainer
in the back seat of Mom's car.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.375
I think a Snickers
got mashed up in it.

17:48.459 --> 17:51.000
- Ugh.
- At least I hope that's a Snickers.

17:52.875 --> 17:53.875
See you at dinner.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.041
We're good,
it's a Snickers.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.625
- Coming along, Arthur?
- Not bad. If you like big boxes.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.750
Big boxes
built this company.

18:11.540 --> 18:13.209
Yes. Yes, they did.

18:14.209 --> 18:16.125
You sure that's
the Walmart footprint?

18:17.125 --> 18:18.166
"Walmart"?

18:18.625 --> 18:20.166
Thought this was for Kmart.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.500
It's Walmart.

18:21.583 --> 18:24.459
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

18:24.540 --> 18:27.083
I, uh, got a lot
on my mind these days.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.375
My father-in-law
just moved in with us, so...

18:30.750 --> 18:33.875
I don't know.
I feel like he judges me.

18:35.291 --> 18:38.833
He thinks I work for some
soul-sucking corporate firm

18:39.000 --> 18:41.916
that has no interest
in the cares or worries of its...

18:45.750 --> 18:46.790
Its employees.

18:52.540 --> 18:53.958
Have a good time.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.665
So I'm just gonna walk home?

18:56.334 --> 18:57.958
Well, you can if you want.

18:59.334 --> 19:00.459
Or you can use this.

19:03.790 --> 19:05.083
I already have a phone.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.625
That's not a phone.
I don't even know what that is.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.500
Just take it.

19:14.459 --> 19:17.083
Okay, now, this is
a car service called Lyft.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.166
You want to go home,
you just swipe that,

19:19.250 --> 19:21.708
somebody comes to get you.
You don't need any cash.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.375
- You don't even have to talk to anybody.
- Just swipe.

19:24.540 --> 19:25.791
Just swipe it.

19:27.916 --> 19:30.750
- Bye, Dad.
- Oh, okay.

19:30.833 --> 19:32.833
- Say hi to Jerry for me.
- I will.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.875
Holy cow.
This is all yours?

19:42.458 --> 19:44.416
This is like
a college kid's dream room.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.166
Are you kidding?

19:47.250 --> 19:49.375
No college kid could afford this.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.916
The pool table alone
is 6 grand.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.334
And you use all this stuff?

19:55.416 --> 19:56.958
Of course, I do.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.458
What do you want to do first?

19:59.540 --> 20:00.665
Eight ball?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.708
Pump some iron?
I got <i>Madden.</i>

20:03.665 --> 20:04.916
And what the heck is that?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.500
That is a Onewheel.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.084
And they are fun.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.125
And you actually
ride that thing?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.209
Hells yes!

20:14.875 --> 20:15.916
Epic!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.500
Whoa!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.125
You should see me.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.791
- Wow!
- Yo, Jerry!

20:28.875 --> 20:31.291
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know you were <i>ocupado.</i>

20:31.540 --> 20:34.000
- This is my old friend Ed.
- Ed.

20:34.084 --> 20:35.334
- Danny.
- Hey. Danny.

20:35.415 --> 20:36.415
- Hi, Danny.
- Glad to meet you.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.375
So, uh, we walking?

20:38.458 --> 20:39.500
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.291
'Cause my masseuse told me

20:41.375 --> 20:43.250
if I got 10,000 steps
in this week,

20:43.334 --> 20:45.166
she would meet me
for coffee.

20:45.625 --> 20:48.125
- Ooh.
- And by coffee, I mean, you know...

20:48.458 --> 20:51.540
- Coffee?
- Yeah, coffee.

20:54.665 --> 20:56.500
- Morning, ladies.
- Really, dude?

20:57.791 --> 20:59.583
Those yoga pants
are gonna be the death of me.

20:59.665 --> 21:00.833
Why do you do that?

21:00.916 --> 21:02.958
What? They think I'm cute.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.041
Yeah, cute, like,
"Aren't old guys cute

21:05.125 --> 21:07.125
"when they still think
they have a shot?"

21:07.209 --> 21:09.875
Hey, I'm a catch.
You know, I got a full pension.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.125
Two more years,
I can ski free as a senior.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.583
- You ski?
- No, I do not.

21:16.084 --> 21:19.334
Morning.
Beautiful morning. How you doing?

21:19.415 --> 21:22.415
Nice, nice.
Next time bring up the pension.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.333
- Or the free skiing you'll never do.
- Oh.

21:24.415 --> 21:25.916
How's your daughter's place, Ed?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.084
It's okay, I guess.

21:28.084 --> 21:29.291
She gave me
my grandson's room.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.415
He's not too happy about it.

21:31.500 --> 21:32.916
He sent me this last night.

21:39.708 --> 21:40.708
Whoa!

21:41.583 --> 21:43.084
How did you respond?

21:43.708 --> 21:46.084
- I didn't.
- You're just gonna roll over on this?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.625
- You got to respond.
- Come on.

21:47.708 --> 21:50.583
This kind of aggression
shall not stand. <i>Semper Fi.</i>

21:50.666 --> 21:52.250
I didn't know
you were a Marine.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.125
I wasn't.
I'm just saying.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.166
Ah, he's a kid.
He's getting used to it, just like I am.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.375
I'm his grandfather.
So you know...

21:58.458 --> 21:59.875
He's not gonna do anything.

21:59.958 --> 22:02.125
What are you talking about?
You can't...

22:15.540 --> 22:17.875
Cotton candy, sweetie
<i>Go, let me see that Tootsie Roll</i>

22:17.959 --> 22:19.875
- <i>Come on, come on</i>
- <i>Tootsie Roll</i>

22:19.959 --> 22:21.875
<i>Just make that Tootsie Roll</i>

22:21.959 --> 22:23.458
- <i>Yeah, come on</i>
- <i>Tootsie Roll</i>

22:23.540 --> 22:25.333

- <i>Tootsie Roll</i>

22:27.833 --> 22:29.333
<i>Just make that Tootsie Roll</i>

22:29.415 --> 22:30.959

22:31.041 --> 22:32.333
<i>Just make your Tootsie Roll</i>

23:02.209 --> 23:03.791
Peter?

23:03.875 --> 23:04.875
Oh, Peter.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.333
Grandpa.
Is that you?

23:08.415 --> 23:10.415
Yeah, it's me.
You know it's me.

23:10.500 --> 23:11.875
You know what time it is?

23:13.458 --> 23:14.458
Nighttime?

23:14.540 --> 23:17.583
It's the middle of the night.
Come on. It's not funny, Peter.

23:17.666 --> 23:19.250
I don't like people
playing tricks on me,

23:19.333 --> 23:21.166
especially not
my own grandson.

23:21.250 --> 23:25.166
It's not a trick.
It's war.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.750
You don't go to war
against your family.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.959
You have to have an enemy to go to war,
and I'm not your enemy.

23:31.041 --> 23:34.791
You got my declaration.
Why didn't you say anything?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.708
Because I was
kind of hoping it was a joke.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.290
It's not a joke.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.625
You took something of mine,
and I want it back.

23:40.875 --> 23:42.916
Okay.
Go back to sleep.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.458
You made your point,
but this is over now.

23:48.541 --> 23:51.000
We'll see you in the morning,
which is almost here.

23:54.541 --> 23:57.375
Grandpa?
I love you.

23:58.625 --> 23:59.750
I love you, too, kiddo.

24:04.208 --> 24:05.333
But the war's still on.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.666
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hey, Jenny.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.959
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

24:21.208 --> 24:22.208
Why not?

24:22.375 --> 24:23.916
'Cause when
Peter lived here,

24:24.458 --> 24:26.583
I wasn't allowed,
unless I sneaked.

24:26.666 --> 24:27.916
Come on, come on.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.290
- So, what can I do for you?
- Nothing.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.625
I just like to look
at other people's stuff.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.750
You know
it's my birthday coming up.

24:38.834 --> 24:39.834
That I do.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.791
Okay.
Just making sure.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.084
What's this?

24:47.165 --> 24:49.000
Those are marbles.

24:49.084 --> 24:50.084
Can I have one?

24:50.959 --> 24:52.791
Sure, if you promise
to take care of it,

24:52.875 --> 24:54.041
because they're
very special.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.708
They're not magic.

24:56.791 --> 25:00.290
People always think
their things are magic and they never are.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.791
No. I didn't say
that they were magic,

25:02.875 --> 25:04.875
but they are special.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.125
Come here.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.834
You remember how Grandpa
used to build houses?

25:10.916 --> 25:12.666
Yeah,
but I wasn't born.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.165
That's true,
you weren't born.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.041
But when you build a house,

25:16.125 --> 25:18.500
you always start
by doing some digging.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.000
And for some reason,
you almost always find marbles.

25:21.208 --> 25:23.750
I guess because they roll around
and get lost easily.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.666
But pretty much
every foundation I ever dug,

25:26.750 --> 25:28.458
I always found
a marble or two.

25:28.541 --> 25:29.834
So, guess what
I did with them?

25:29.916 --> 25:31.208
- What?
- I kept them.

25:31.541 --> 25:33.250
So, if you count
all those marbles,

25:33.333 --> 25:35.083
you'll know
how many houses I built.

25:35.290 --> 25:37.375
That's a lot of houses.

25:37.458 --> 25:39.500
I worked a long time.

25:39.583 --> 25:40.834
How come
you don't work now?

25:40.916 --> 25:42.959
Because I'm what
you call "retired."

25:43.333 --> 25:44.959
What's "retired"?

25:45.041 --> 25:48.165
It's when you stop working
so you can do other things.

25:48.834 --> 25:51.083
Like your grandmother and I
had big plans,

25:51.165 --> 25:54.625
but sometimes things
just don't work out.

25:56.125 --> 25:57.458
Can I have a marble now?

25:57.541 --> 25:58.541
Sure.

26:04.834 --> 26:05.834
What the...

26:09.250 --> 26:10.708
Careful, sweetheart.
Careful, careful.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.040
Are you okay, Grandpa?

26:25.125 --> 26:27.000
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just gonna rest

26:27.083 --> 26:29.165
down here for a while.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.583
Can I still have a marble?

26:32.666 --> 26:33.875
Take whatever you want.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.666
Oh, no.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.750
No, no.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.709
No.

26:46.416 --> 26:49.500
What's that racket upstairs?

26:49.583 --> 26:51.583
Grandpa lost his marbles.

27:18.208 --> 27:19.333
You wanted to see me?

27:19.416 --> 27:20.959
Yeah, come on in.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.250
Shut the door.

27:26.165 --> 27:27.208
Have a seat.

27:29.541 --> 27:30.875
So...

27:30.959 --> 27:33.625
You know that big jar
of marbles I had?

27:33.709 --> 27:36.040
No. How would I know
about the things you have

27:36.125 --> 27:37.625
in your room...

27:37.709 --> 27:39.165
that used to be mine?

27:39.250 --> 27:40.291
That's good.

27:40.375 --> 27:41.416
That's funny.

27:41.666 --> 27:42.834
That's real funny.

27:42.916 --> 27:44.834
Everybody likes a funny kid.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.416
I thought we were done with this.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.250
All you have to do
is tell Mom and Dad

27:49.333 --> 27:50.791
that you want
to switch rooms with me.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.125
And then it'll be done.

27:52.208 --> 27:54.291
You really want a war?

27:54.375 --> 27:56.040
Because, you know,
I've been in one.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.583
And it's not like video games.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.416
Even if you win,
everybody gets hurt.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.000
I only want what's mine.

28:01.083 --> 28:02.375
By playing hardball, huh?

28:02.583 --> 28:03.875
I'm not playing.

28:03.958 --> 28:05.291
Fair enough.

28:06.834 --> 28:09.083
So, what are the rules of engagement?

28:09.165 --> 28:10.458
The what?

28:10.541 --> 28:12.875
Rules of engagement.

28:12.958 --> 28:15.291
What's allowed
and not allowed.

28:15.375 --> 28:16.875
You don't have rules
in a war.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.416
Oh, yes, you do.

28:20.083 --> 28:21.165
"Rule number one...

28:21.791 --> 28:24.040
"No collateral damage

28:24.125 --> 28:27.333
"to civilians
or their property."

28:27.416 --> 28:30.625
That means it can't affect
your parents or your sisters.

28:30.915 --> 28:32.416
Agreed.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.541
"Rule number two...

28:34.625 --> 28:35.834
"No telling."

28:35.915 --> 28:37.375
This is man-to-man,

28:37.458 --> 28:39.000
just between me and you.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.584
No ratting the other guy out.

28:41.666 --> 28:42.791
Agreed.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.125
Okay. Sign.

28:57.375 --> 28:59.040
Okay.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.458
You got your wish, Secret Warrior.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.000
Okay...

29:03.083 --> 29:04.584
Senior Soldier.

29:09.165 --> 29:10.416
But from now on,

29:10.500 --> 29:11.709
you better watch out.

29:17.165 --> 29:18.915
<i>The jungle...</i>

29:19.000 --> 29:21.458
<i>a place where animals
both big and small,</i>

29:22.125 --> 29:24.208
<i>exotic and bizarre,</i>

29:24.291 --> 29:27.625
<i>coexist with one another
in the same space</i>

29:27.709 --> 29:30.584
<i>and in the same time.</i>

29:30.666 --> 29:33.791
<i>The game... to survive.</i>

29:33.875 --> 29:36.791
<i>The stakes... life and death.</i>

29:37.750 --> 29:41.625
<i>Those who strike first
live to see another day.</i>

29:42.584 --> 29:44.125
<i>Those who sleep</i>

29:44.208 --> 29:45.875
<i>will be eaten alive.</i>

29:54.208 --> 29:58.709
<i>I've heard people whisper</i>

29:58.791 --> 30:03.750
<i>That you aren't being true</i>

30:03.833 --> 30:07.208
<i>I just let them whisper</i>

30:07.291 --> 30:13.375
<i>'Cause all I've got is you</i>

30:13.458 --> 30:16.791
<i>I've gotta believe</i>

30:16.875 --> 30:19.833
<i>In something</i>

30:19.915 --> 30:21.000
<i>I've gotta believe...</i>

30:35.625 --> 30:38.666
Okay. Okay.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.416
What the...

31:03.125 --> 31:04.875
What is this stuff?

31:07.750 --> 31:09.750
Fast-drying foam sealant.

31:10.416 --> 31:12.083
I'm gonna kill this kid.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.584
You don't mess with me,
you little...

31:18.000 --> 31:19.166
You think you're cute?

31:19.250 --> 31:21.666
You've welcomed a world of pain,
my friend.

31:21.958 --> 31:24.416
You'll be sorry.
Mess with me, you little...

31:27.915 --> 31:29.958
Think you're cute?
You're not cute!

31:30.958 --> 31:32.040
Ah!

31:33.915 --> 31:35.790
Oh!

31:37.915 --> 31:39.709
Oh!

31:39.875 --> 31:41.208
Oh!

31:41.459 --> 31:43.375
This will never be spoken of.

31:43.459 --> 31:45.500
No idea what you're talking about.

31:49.416 --> 31:50.584
Oh!

31:51.041 --> 31:53.459
You're doing very well,
Grandpa.

31:53.541 --> 31:54.541
Thank you, sweetheart.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.166
You're a very good teacher.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.915
Why is your face all red?

31:59.000 --> 32:00.416
I don't know.

32:01.166 --> 32:03.833
I may be allergic
to something in this house.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.915
I'm off to shaving cream.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.790
I mean, school.

32:08.875 --> 32:11.750
Uh, Peter, is that your binder?

32:13.500 --> 32:14.915
Yeah. Thanks.

32:17.750 --> 32:19.584
Have a good day at school,
kiddo.

32:19.666 --> 32:20.875
Love you.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.208
Hey, Pete.

32:29.291 --> 32:31.334
How's your super unnecessary
war going?

32:31.416 --> 32:34.041
Not good.
I was up all night.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.250
Couldn't sleep at all.

32:35.541 --> 32:38.083
- Diarrhea?
- What? No.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.000
My grandpa.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.291
Your grandpa had diarrhea?

32:41.375 --> 32:43.958
No. There's no diarrhea
in this story.

32:44.541 --> 32:45.625
Oh.

32:46.125 --> 32:48.083
I did what
you said yesterday,

32:48.166 --> 32:50.000
and I hit him good
multiple times.

32:50.083 --> 32:52.208
I even put hot sauce
in his coffee this morning.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.125
<i>So far, nothing.</i>

33:07.375 --> 33:09.625
Dude, your grandfather's using psyops.

33:09.708 --> 33:11.584
Psychological warfare.

33:11.665 --> 33:14.334
Or maybe he's just
being an adult.

33:14.416 --> 33:17.790
Peter, if you're done talking,
maybe you'd like to read us

33:17.875 --> 33:20.125
your report on what you did
over your summer vacation?

33:20.208 --> 33:21.541
Yeah. Sure.

33:24.541 --> 33:26.790
"My Summer Vacation"
by Peter Decker.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.459
"This summer was one
of the best summer breaks I've ever had.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.584
"I rode my bike a lot
and stopped showering

33:31.665 --> 33:33.915
"until I smelled
like a monkey's butt."

33:37.000 --> 33:39.125
Keep reading, Peter.
Go on.

33:39.208 --> 33:41.125
- I don't want to. This isn't my...
- Read.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.625
"During my vacation,

33:46.708 --> 33:49.833
"I figured out how to freeze
my own farts in a baggie."

33:52.833 --> 33:54.208
I didn't write this!

33:54.291 --> 33:55.416
Have a seat.

33:55.583 --> 33:57.416
And see me after class.

34:02.790 --> 34:03.832
Psyops.

34:21.458 --> 34:22.498
Amateur.

34:42.373 --> 34:44.000
What's going on here?

34:44.081 --> 34:46.625
Nothing. Nothing. We were just, um...

34:46.708 --> 34:49.416
I was just dropping off
some vocabulary drills.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.458
- Really?
- Vocabulary.

34:52.083 --> 34:53.750
Russell, go.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.416
Mia, stay.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.000
Do we not have a policy

34:59.083 --> 35:01.541
about no boys in this house
when no one is here?

35:01.625 --> 35:03.791
Oh, my God, Mom,
don't blow a gasket.

35:03.875 --> 35:05.041
We weren't doing anything.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.708
Don't you think
I was your age once?

35:06.791 --> 35:08.583
- No, I don't.
- Really?

35:08.666 --> 35:10.833
- Yeah, 'cause you are...
- What?

35:10.916 --> 35:13.083
- You are literally... You are...
- Say it.

35:15.125 --> 35:17.875
Those vocabulary drills
are paying off, sweetie.

35:17.958 --> 35:18.958
Ugh!

35:41.750 --> 35:42.875
What the heck?

35:43.791 --> 35:45.166
Whoa!

35:52.375 --> 35:54.708
Don't start nothing,
won't be nothing.

35:56.375 --> 35:57.500
He got me.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.083
I got him good.
Tape on the doorway.

36:04.166 --> 36:06.208
Like I wouldn't
see that coming from a mile away.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.208
- Rookie!
- Tape on the doorway.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.750
Tape on the doorway.

36:10.166 --> 36:11.458
Step back, boys.
Big hitter.

36:11.541 --> 36:13.125
- All right.
- Yep. Stepping back.

36:23.666 --> 36:24.833
We should skip this hole.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.416
- Yeah, good idea. Come on.
- Yeah.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.666
I wonder how my grandpa's
golf game is... going.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.541
My Jordans.

36:38.916 --> 36:42.750
Dude, I think
your grandpa might be a ninja.

36:43.250 --> 36:44.750
My Jordans!

37:03.875 --> 37:04.916
First time?

37:05.000 --> 37:06.750
Unfortunately, no.

37:07.958 --> 37:09.458
What are you,
a spy or something?

37:09.541 --> 37:12.041
No, I'm just trying
to outsmart my grandson.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.541
We're in the middle of
a turf battle over a bedroom.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.666
I just moved into
my daughter's house, so...

37:16.750 --> 37:18.291
No, no, no,
don't say anything else.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.083
That way,
they can't make me testify.

37:20.916 --> 37:22.166
I won't.

37:23.750 --> 37:24.750
You need a hand?

37:24.833 --> 37:26.458
No, let me give it
one more shot.

37:28.541 --> 37:31.416
Oh, come on.
Yeah, I...

37:31.500 --> 37:32.708
All right,
what am I doing wrong now?

37:32.791 --> 37:35.083
Oh! No, I'm not
gonna help you now.

37:35.166 --> 37:37.750
- That way, you'll never learn.
- Making it tough on me, huh?

37:41.375 --> 37:42.791
You're on your way.

37:45.958 --> 37:46.958
<i>Bam!</i>

37:47.041 --> 37:49.833
<i>Cars like this
1974 Volkswagen Bug use...</i>

37:49.916 --> 37:51.208
We had one of those, remember?

37:51.291 --> 37:53.291
- We changed the clutch on it.
- Yeah, how could I forget?

37:53.375 --> 37:54.666
You dropped the flywheel
on my toe.

37:54.750 --> 37:58.625
That was your fault
for mistaking me for your son.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.416
Anybody want to watch
anything else, maybe?

38:00.500 --> 38:02.166
Like, uh, Netflix?

38:03.083 --> 38:04.208
Weather Channel?

38:04.708 --> 38:06.541
C-SPAN?

38:06.625 --> 38:08.041
<i>The Grinch
Who Stole Christmas.</i>

38:08.125 --> 38:09.166
Hey, yeah.

38:09.333 --> 38:10.875
Hey. Going to Skyler's house.

38:11.125 --> 38:12.833
What? Now?

38:13.375 --> 38:14.625
Yeah. I'm studying.

38:15.541 --> 38:17.958
Do you want me to get
into a good college or not?

38:20.541 --> 38:21.666
Okay. Bye.

38:22.916 --> 38:24.833
She's going to see Russell.
I know it.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.375
- What?
- None of my business.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.000
No, come on.
You're gonna say it anyway.

38:31.083 --> 38:32.500
Okay.

38:32.583 --> 38:35.291
My advice about fighting
with her about her boyfriend is don't.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.375
It cost me
two years with you.

38:37.833 --> 38:38.833
Yeah.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.166
When you started
dating Artie here.

38:40.250 --> 38:41.875
That's not true.
I don't remember that.

38:41.958 --> 38:43.333
I do.
It was terrible.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.166
I was over at the house
all the time.

38:45.250 --> 38:46.916
Yeah, you were
over at the house talking to your mother.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.500
You barely talked
to me at all.

38:49.708 --> 38:50.916
Oh.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:52.791 --> 38:54.083
Um... Sorry, Dad.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.541
No, don't be.
It was my fault.

38:55.625 --> 38:56.875
I thought he wasn't
good enough for you,

38:56.958 --> 38:59.125
till I realized
that wasn't the point.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.541
The point was you thought
he was good enough for you.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.750
But you and Arthur
get along great now.

39:04.833 --> 39:06.416
Because I stopped
being an idiot.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.625
But I'll never get
those two years back.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.166
Wow. Uh...

39:11.541 --> 39:12.916
I appreciate that, Ed.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.666
You're welcome, Artie. I mean,
I meant that, sincerely.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.750
But the career,
not so much.

39:19.083 --> 39:20.250
What?

39:20.666 --> 39:21.833
Dad!

39:21.916 --> 39:23.583
Nothing against Artie.
It's just that I think

39:23.666 --> 39:25.833
that people who lose sight
of their dreams

39:25.916 --> 39:27.916
and settle for less
are never very happy.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
That's all.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.791
Really?
I find that those same people

39:31.875 --> 39:33.958
tend to have
secure incomes.

39:34.041 --> 39:37.000
Which then allow them to,
I don't know,

39:37.083 --> 39:39.083
take in an aging senior,
perhaps.

39:39.166 --> 39:40.708
And the name's Arthur.

39:41.958 --> 39:44.500
Come on, honey.
Let's go. It's bedtime.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.583
Here we go.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.166
Night, sweetie.

39:47.250 --> 39:48.500
- Night.
- Good night.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.666
I thought you stopped
being an idiot.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.083
Sorry.

40:04.625 --> 40:06.375
I can't put anything
back together.

40:06.458 --> 40:08.083
He took all of the screws.

40:08.166 --> 40:10.000
So now I'm sleeping
on the floor.

40:10.083 --> 40:11.250
<i>That's hilarious.</i>

40:11.666 --> 40:12.916
Yeah. Ha ha.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.458
<i>Dude, you might have
to face the fact</i>

40:14.541 --> 40:16.041
<i>that your grandfather's
just smarter than you.</i>

40:16.125 --> 40:18.458
- Hey!
- <i>Billy, nice snake.</i>

40:18.541 --> 40:19.541
<i>Thanks.</i>

40:19.625 --> 40:22.708
<i>Steven, I found the dog
chewing your snuggables again.</i>

40:22.916 --> 40:25.166
<i>Those aren't mine.</i>

40:25.541 --> 40:26.583
<i>Really?</i>

40:26.666 --> 40:29.250
<i>It says "Captain Steve"
on the waistband.</i>

40:29.333 --> 40:32.541
- <i>Get out of my room!</i>
- <i>Captain Steve.</i>

40:42.083 --> 40:44.166
- See? Not that hard.
- Yeah.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.541
Thanks, kiddo.

40:45.625 --> 40:47.458
Okay, off you go.

40:47.541 --> 40:48.791
Skedaddle. Thanks.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.250
Yeah. Now you're talking.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.000
<i>I know something
you could do, Peter.</i>

41:01.083 --> 41:02.375
- What?
- <i>You could use</i>

41:02.458 --> 41:04.083
<i>some of the mental energy
you're expending</i>

41:04.166 --> 41:05.666
<i>on thinking up
stupid tricks</i>

41:05.750 --> 41:08.750
<i>to play on your grandfather
to not get a C in math.</i>

41:08.833 --> 41:12.000
Who cares about math?
This is real life.

41:12.083 --> 41:15.166
<i>Said the guy building
a fake castle in a video game.</i>

41:15.250 --> 41:17.666
Petersburg isn't a castle.

41:17.750 --> 41:18.916
<i>It's a palace.</i>

41:19.000 --> 41:22.250
And after three years in the making,
it's almost finished.

41:22.541 --> 41:24.333
Too easy.

41:32.125 --> 41:33.125
No.

41:33.208 --> 41:34.625
Uh-oh.

41:35.875 --> 41:38.250
And then see
if the light comes back on.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.750
No!

41:41.291 --> 41:43.458
Any nimrod knows that.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.208
What the...

42:20.375 --> 42:21.416
Did you bring it?

42:21.500 --> 42:22.666
You got the cash?

42:27.625 --> 42:28.875
Dude, it's all there.

42:28.958 --> 42:31.458
I'm sure it is, Pete.
I'm sure it is.

42:54.500 --> 42:56.041
Not funny, Peter.

42:56.916 --> 42:58.041
Nice snake.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.458
Nice, nice snake.
Nice snake.

42:59.541 --> 43:01.333
Nice. Take all the room
you want.

43:01.416 --> 43:02.416
Do whatever you want.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.958
I'm just gonna go...

43:05.041 --> 43:06.291
Go over here.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.958
Don't mind if I do, Eddie.

43:22.708 --> 43:24.125
You stay there.
You stay there.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.833
You stay there.

44:10.791 --> 44:11.791
What's that?

44:11.875 --> 44:13.791
It's a Vitalert necklace.

44:13.875 --> 44:15.125
A what?

44:15.208 --> 44:16.958
Like those TV commercials?

44:17.041 --> 44:18.833
You expect me to wear that?

44:18.916 --> 44:20.583
Absolutely not.

44:20.666 --> 44:22.666
Absolutely not.
No way.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.541
- Look. You know, you just...
- No.

44:24.625 --> 44:25.791
You wear it
under your shirt,

44:25.875 --> 44:27.833
and, hey, nobody can
even see it.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.041
- You can't see that.
- Right?

44:29.125 --> 44:30.375
If you don't want
to wear it for you,

44:30.458 --> 44:31.875
wear it for me.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.000
But I don't need this.

44:34.083 --> 44:35.541
- Really?
- I don't need this.

44:35.625 --> 44:38.875
Because Arthur says
that you've been acting...

44:39.791 --> 44:41.166
Oddly.

44:41.250 --> 44:43.541
- He has?
- For the record,

44:43.625 --> 44:45.583
I didn't say "oddly."

44:45.666 --> 44:47.333
I said "confused."

44:48.666 --> 44:50.291
- Confused?
- Look, Dad,

44:50.375 --> 44:53.000
is it so hard to believe
that we care about you?

44:53.083 --> 44:54.416
Probably won't even need
to use it.

44:54.500 --> 44:56.833
You got that right,
'cause I'm not wearing it.

44:56.916 --> 44:59.625
Look, it gives me
peace of mind to know

44:59.708 --> 45:01.625
that with just one push
of a button,

45:01.708 --> 45:03.541
you can get help
if you need it.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.166
Please?

45:09.916 --> 45:11.083
Please.

45:25.083 --> 45:26.791
Sweet necklace, Grandpa.

45:26.875 --> 45:29.166
For every action, my friend.

45:44.541 --> 45:45.958
Ugh!

46:20.083 --> 46:21.500
Ugh!

46:24.625 --> 46:26.416
And this is how
you found him?

46:26.500 --> 46:28.166
Yeah.

46:28.250 --> 46:31.083
When I couldn't reach him online,
I got worried.

46:31.916 --> 46:36.000
My life's work...
Ruined!

46:36.083 --> 46:38.583
All I see is a pile of rubble.

46:38.666 --> 46:40.916
He destroyed Petersburg!

46:41.000 --> 46:43.583
I've been building it for more
than a third of my life.

46:43.666 --> 46:46.208
Actually, three over 12
is exactly 25%,

46:46.291 --> 46:48.375
which is less than a third
of your life.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.500
Well, it is.

46:52.916 --> 46:53.916
It's okay, buddy.

47:28.208 --> 47:30.416
Oh. You see, dear?

47:30.500 --> 47:32.708
I was right.
The boy's coming around.

47:32.791 --> 47:35.875
Do you both promise
to use your words?

47:35.958 --> 47:37.666
I promise.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.208
Why are we
doing it this way?

47:39.291 --> 47:41.416
Because,
when you have peace talks,

47:41.500 --> 47:43.416
you need someone neutral
to mediate.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.541
Otherwise,
it just breaks down into yelling.

47:45.625 --> 47:47.375
- This is dumb!
- Well, we're doing it.

47:47.458 --> 47:48.750
Besides, it took me
five minutes

47:48.833 --> 47:50.583
to get in this chair,
and I'm not getting out.

47:51.250 --> 47:54.166
Grandpa promised.
You have to promise.

47:54.625 --> 47:57.333
Okay, fine.
I promise.

47:57.416 --> 48:00.000
Good.
Now, I will admit

48:00.083 --> 48:01.500
that hostilities may have
escalated

48:01.583 --> 48:02.958
more than either of us
anticipated.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.416
You don't touch
another man's computer!

48:05.500 --> 48:06.666
That's not cool!

48:06.750 --> 48:08.500
That's what war
is all about, kiddo.

48:08.583 --> 48:11.208
War. I just want
my room back!

48:11.291 --> 48:14.333
- No yelling.
- I'm not yelling. He's yelling.

48:14.416 --> 48:16.208
Say you're sorry
to Grandpa.

48:16.291 --> 48:17.750
No, it's okay,
sweetheart.

48:17.833 --> 48:18.958
I love you, Grandpa.

48:19.041 --> 48:20.083
I love you, too.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.416
- Stop that!
- Stop what?

48:22.500 --> 48:24.458
- What's going on here?
- Nothing's going on here.

48:24.541 --> 48:25.541
You're supposed to
be neutral!

48:25.625 --> 48:27.541
I don't even know
what that means.

48:27.625 --> 48:30.833
It means you shouldn't
act like you like him better than me.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.750
I do like him
better than you.

48:32.833 --> 48:34.083
He gave me a cookie.

48:35.750 --> 48:37.333
Okay, that sounds worse
than it is.

48:37.416 --> 48:39.750
It is true a cookie was given,
but it was way before

48:39.833 --> 48:41.750
this negotiation
had even been scheduled.

48:42.958 --> 48:45.791
Chocolate chip,
my favorite.

48:46.250 --> 48:47.875
Mine, too.

48:47.958 --> 48:48.958
That's it.

48:49.041 --> 48:50.791
I'm done.
Peace is canceled.

48:50.875 --> 48:53.458
- No yelling.
- Shut up!

48:53.541 --> 48:55.750
- Shut up's a bad word.
- Peter.

48:56.416 --> 48:58.166
Can I have
my second cookie now?

48:58.250 --> 48:59.833
Peter, hold on.
Please.

48:59.916 --> 49:01.125
Come on.
You're right.

49:01.208 --> 49:02.500
A cookie may have
been involved,

49:02.583 --> 49:05.458
which may have been an attempt
to influence the mediator,

49:05.541 --> 49:09.041
which, in retrospect,
may have been inappropriate.

49:09.125 --> 49:11.000
- May have been?
- Okay, to be fair,

49:11.083 --> 49:13.541
you entered negotiations with
a bit of an attitude yourself.

49:13.625 --> 49:15.625
You didn't really give peace
a chance, either.

49:15.708 --> 49:19.125
Why should I?
You demolished Petersburg.

49:19.208 --> 49:21.666
But that's what I've been
trying to tell you when this all started.

49:21.750 --> 49:23.916
War is no game, Peter.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.541
Only kids and fools
and generals think that.

49:26.625 --> 49:27.625
War hurts.

49:27.708 --> 49:31.041
War wounds and kills
and causes misery.

49:31.125 --> 49:33.041
We got to end this somehow.

49:33.125 --> 49:34.916
How?

49:35.000 --> 49:38.250
What if we have one final competition,
winner take all?

49:38.333 --> 49:40.833
- What kind of competition?
- I don't know. You pick.

49:40.916 --> 49:43.083
Whatever you want, I'll do it
and this whole thing will be over.

49:43.625 --> 49:45.333
- Whatever I want?
- Whatever you want.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.583
Okay.

49:51.708 --> 49:52.750
It's not a date.

49:52.958 --> 49:54.666
It's just that
we need a fourth for the team

49:54.750 --> 49:57.458
and it needs to be a woman,
and I don't know anyone else.

49:58.250 --> 49:59.250
So, let me
get this straight.

49:59.333 --> 50:01.041
You want me
to help you and your buddies

50:01.125 --> 50:03.416
to beat up your grandson
and his buddies,

50:03.500 --> 50:04.875
because the two of you
can't figure out

50:04.958 --> 50:06.916
some way to live
in the same house?

50:07.583 --> 50:09.291
Well, when you put it
like that...

50:09.375 --> 50:10.500
I'm in.

50:11.166 --> 50:13.958
My granddaughter can be
a pain in the butt sometimes.

50:22.208 --> 50:23.208
Whoo!

50:26.416 --> 50:28.041
Holy Mary, we're dead.

50:28.291 --> 50:30.208
It's just an intimidation tactic, Danny.

50:30.416 --> 50:32.208
Don't let them see your fear.

50:32.416 --> 50:33.666
They feed off that.

50:33.750 --> 50:35.916
They're like baby velociraptors.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.166
Yeah. We're up.

50:39.875 --> 50:41.916
Do you guys even remember
how to play dodgeball?

50:42.000 --> 50:44.458
Did they
even have dodgeball in the 1800s?

50:44.541 --> 50:46.625
They had wiseass kids,
I know that.

50:46.708 --> 50:48.583
And just remember,
no headsies.

50:48.666 --> 50:49.708
And no nutsies.

50:49.875 --> 50:51.250
No aiming for the junk.

50:51.541 --> 50:52.666
Yeah. What he said.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.166
Hope you brought your Poligrip, old man,

50:54.250 --> 50:55.666
'cause those false teeth
are coming out.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.250
Big words for a little baby.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.750
Sure you don't need
your diaper changed?

51:00.208 --> 51:01.291
Sure you don't?

51:01.375 --> 51:03.166
Ooh!

51:03.250 --> 51:04.958
- Men.
- Tell me about it.

51:05.166 --> 51:07.041
You're gonna love the attic, Grandpa.

51:07.208 --> 51:08.875
We're gonna see about that,
Petey boy.

51:08.958 --> 51:10.583
Let's get it on.

51:10.666 --> 51:11.875
Let's get it on!

51:24.375 --> 51:25.375
Hi.

51:25.458 --> 51:26.791
Run for your lives!

51:27.250 --> 51:28.250
Fire!

51:30.208 --> 51:32.250
I'm already regretting
agreeing to do this.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.541
Man down.

51:38.041 --> 51:39.958
Hey! We said no headsies.

51:40.291 --> 51:42.291
Oops. It slipped.

51:42.375 --> 51:44.166
Punk.

51:44.375 --> 51:45.958
That's game!

51:46.041 --> 51:47.708
Age Appropriate Team, one.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.166
- Whoo!
- Yeah! That's what's up!

51:50.250 --> 51:52.375
AARP Team, none.

51:54.375 --> 51:56.666
My ears are ringing.
This is barbaric.

51:56.750 --> 51:58.250
Man up, Danny.
Get in the game.

51:58.333 --> 52:00.208
- Who's this again?
- Come on, bring it in, guys.

52:00.291 --> 52:01.625
Bring it in.

52:02.208 --> 52:04.458
Obviously, they're way too fast for us.

52:04.541 --> 52:05.666
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:05.750 --> 52:07.250
We're gonna have to
play our game

52:07.333 --> 52:09.000
if we're gonna win this thing.
Am I right?

52:09.083 --> 52:10.291
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

52:10.375 --> 52:11.916
Okay. I have an idea.

52:14.416 --> 52:16.250
Game two.
Positions, people.

52:20.208 --> 52:21.625
Grab 'em!

52:26.500 --> 52:27.625
Fire!

52:35.000 --> 52:36.791
Yeah. Now you're in trouble.

52:39.083 --> 52:40.333
Boom!

52:41.125 --> 52:42.375
Out, out, out.

52:42.458 --> 52:43.791
Two catches and a hit.
You three.

52:43.875 --> 52:46.083
Come on, you old coots,
give me your best shot.

52:46.250 --> 52:48.500
Well, if it isn't Mr. Headsies.

52:49.375 --> 52:50.375
Whoo!

52:50.958 --> 52:51.958
Whoo!

52:57.541 --> 52:58.750
Nutsies.

52:59.958 --> 53:01.375
Oops. Slipped.

53:01.458 --> 53:03.500
That's game two.
We tied, one apiece.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.833
Final match.
Winner takes all.

53:06.375 --> 53:07.791
You okay?

53:08.125 --> 53:09.458
Okay?

53:09.750 --> 53:11.166
Positions, people.

53:16.875 --> 53:18.208
What's he doing?

53:18.291 --> 53:19.291
Danny.

53:21.791 --> 53:22.833
You're an animal.

53:22.916 --> 53:24.125
Hells yeah!

53:24.208 --> 53:25.541
Whose house is this?

53:25.625 --> 53:26.708
- Our house!
- Our house!

53:26.791 --> 53:29.083
- Yeah!
- Let's do this.

53:45.750 --> 53:46.916
Jerry, what happened?

53:47.291 --> 53:48.791
I tore something.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.541
Yeah, I definitely heard a pop.

53:52.416 --> 53:54.333
Dude... I mean, old dude.

53:54.416 --> 53:56.416
- Are you okay?
- Of course he's okay, dummy.

53:59.791 --> 54:01.416
You, you're out.

54:01.625 --> 54:02.750
Cheap.

54:09.875 --> 54:11.791
You can't get me.
I'm on fire!

54:14.708 --> 54:16.000
Sorry, Danny.

54:25.291 --> 54:27.583
Oh! What's up, son?

54:33.875 --> 54:35.083
You two, out.

54:35.500 --> 54:37.625
- What?
- That's not fair!

54:37.708 --> 54:39.166
Yeah, ref, doesn't count.

54:39.250 --> 54:41.541
Kid was already out
and he throws like a girl.

54:41.708 --> 54:42.958
Ooh!

54:43.625 --> 54:45.583
Diane, what's with the friendly fire?

54:45.666 --> 54:47.416
What are you,
a rogue agent now?

54:47.500 --> 54:48.833
You three, out.

54:49.083 --> 54:50.375
- Yes!
- Nice.

54:50.625 --> 54:53.708
Sorry, Peter's grandpa,
but I'm gonna end you.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.833
Hey, what happened to the sisterhood?

54:56.916 --> 54:57.958
Sorry, kid.

55:00.750 --> 55:03.750
- You will not have died in vain.
- This is so dumb.

55:03.833 --> 55:06.458
Yeah, you're out now.
Off you go.

55:09.666 --> 55:11.125
Come on, Peter, you got this!

55:11.208 --> 55:12.791
- End him.
- Get your room back.

55:14.291 --> 55:16.000
Finish him, Ed.

55:17.208 --> 55:19.625
What are y'all waiting for?
End it!

55:20.041 --> 55:22.375
I got an 8-year-old's
birthday party that's next.

55:40.041 --> 55:41.041
- It's a tie.
- What?

55:41.125 --> 55:42.208
- Come on.
- No way!

55:42.291 --> 55:43.625
- What? No way!
- What? A tie?

55:43.708 --> 55:45.083
I totally caught his ball
before he caught mine.

55:45.166 --> 55:46.500
No, I caught the ball first.

55:46.583 --> 55:47.875
- Really?
- Seriously, he caught it before him.

55:47.958 --> 55:49.708
- He bobbled his.
- I didn't bobble anything.

55:49.791 --> 55:50.833
He's got butterfingers.

55:51.708 --> 55:52.875
See? Butter.

55:52.958 --> 55:54.833
He's old...
His fingers don't work.

55:55.041 --> 55:56.416
I got one finger that works.

55:58.083 --> 56:00.166
Okay, that's enough.
Game over.

56:00.250 --> 56:01.833
Go home, all y'all, seriously. Leave.

56:01.916 --> 56:03.000
- I won.
- Yeah, sure.

56:03.083 --> 56:04.625
- I won.
- Are you kidding me?

56:04.708 --> 56:06.000
- You lost. I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

56:06.083 --> 56:07.416
- You know that.
- What are you talking about?

56:07.500 --> 56:09.416
I obviously caught it before you.

56:09.583 --> 56:11.250
This place have a bar?

56:11.333 --> 56:12.333
Hmm.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.000
What's this?

56:20.791 --> 56:22.083
I'm just doodling.

56:22.166 --> 56:24.083
It doesn't look like
one of your usual...

56:24.166 --> 56:25.875
what do you call 'em, boxes.

56:26.208 --> 56:27.666
Yeah.

56:28.208 --> 56:29.500
No, don't get me wrong.
I meant...

56:29.583 --> 56:30.958
It's interesting, really.
I like it.

56:31.291 --> 56:32.541
Is this for work?

56:32.625 --> 56:34.458
No, the... The city's

56:34.541 --> 56:36.416
taking bids for an addition
to the library.

56:36.500 --> 56:39.375
So I thought I would
submit a design.

56:39.708 --> 56:41.416
But you know how it is.
I'm sure they'll

56:41.500 --> 56:43.041
just pick one of the big firms.

56:43.916 --> 56:47.208
Well, you miss 100%
of the shots you don't take.

56:48.083 --> 56:49.666
You know who said that?

56:49.916 --> 56:51.125
Uh...

56:51.833 --> 56:52.916
No.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.041
Wayne Gretzky.

56:55.250 --> 56:57.291
Best hockey player
of all time.

56:57.375 --> 56:59.125
I was gonna say that.

56:59.375 --> 57:00.708
The Great One?

57:00.791 --> 57:02.125
The greatest.

57:02.375 --> 57:03.708
Still not a sports guy.

57:03.791 --> 57:05.291
- Nah.
- Okay.

57:46.750 --> 57:48.666
- Found him.
- Prepare a sedative.

57:48.750 --> 57:50.333
Just lay down, sir.

57:50.416 --> 57:51.583
What is this?

57:51.666 --> 57:52.916
- Relax, sir.
- Hold him. Hold him.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.375
We're trying to save your life, sir.

57:54.458 --> 57:55.541
Get that thing away from me!

57:55.708 --> 57:56.750
Sir, you are not helping us.

57:56.833 --> 57:57.958
I just bought these,
you idiot!

57:58.041 --> 57:59.208
- What are you...
- Don't worry, sir.

57:59.291 --> 58:00.666
You're in good hands.

58:00.958 --> 58:02.625
You touch me with those,
you die!

58:02.708 --> 58:03.833
- Patient appears combative.
- You touch me with those...

58:03.916 --> 58:05.083
We might need restraints.

58:05.166 --> 58:06.625
Restraints!
I don't need restraints!

58:06.708 --> 58:09.208
- Just relax, sir.
- Don't do it!

58:11.458 --> 58:12.958
Dude, I hated that test.

58:13.375 --> 58:15.041
I think I did pretty good.

58:17.375 --> 58:18.875
Get in the car.

58:21.250 --> 58:22.250
Uh...

58:22.541 --> 58:24.375
Thanks,

58:24.458 --> 58:27.500
but I think I'm just gonna
take the bus home with my friends.

58:27.583 --> 58:29.166
Come on, get in the car.

58:32.750 --> 58:34.291
Bye.

58:43.375 --> 58:45.000
Friend of yours?

58:45.208 --> 58:46.666
That's Chuck.

58:46.750 --> 58:48.625
You don't need to know
about Chuck.

58:52.458 --> 58:53.791
Um...

58:54.541 --> 58:55.750
Where are we going?

58:55.833 --> 58:56.958
Clear Lake.

58:57.041 --> 58:58.958
Nice place.
You'll like it.

59:09.416 --> 59:11.375
You know I'm only 12, right?

59:12.583 --> 59:14.583
That's a lot of life
left to live.

59:15.000 --> 59:17.666
I could be president someday.

59:19.416 --> 59:21.958
Be on the first manned
mission to Mars.

59:22.791 --> 59:24.750
Holy heck!

59:26.333 --> 59:27.875
Get out.

59:37.083 --> 59:38.625
You know...

59:38.708 --> 59:40.541
Mom's expecting us
for dinner.

59:40.625 --> 59:42.750
Maybe I should call her,

59:42.833 --> 59:44.375
let her know
where we're at.

59:44.458 --> 59:46.625
Don't bother. We're bringing
dinner home tonight.

59:50.083 --> 59:51.958
I rented it
for a couple hours.

59:52.083 --> 59:54.250
I thought me and you
could do a little fishing.

59:54.333 --> 59:55.500
Together.

59:56.708 --> 59:57.833
How's that sound?

59:57.916 --> 59:59.333
Great!

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.750
I mean,
I'm not gonna have fun.

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.375
You'll have fun.

01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:15.250
I think I caught one.

01:00:16.583 --> 01:00:18.625
That a way.

01:00:19.625 --> 01:00:21.083
It's got to be a big one.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.666
- Hey!
- He's huge!

01:00:24.875 --> 01:00:26.291
Nice going.

01:00:26.541 --> 01:00:27.958
Yeah.

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.750
That's not a fish.
That's a whale.

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:31.166
He really fought, too.

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.541
We're gonna have some good
eating tonight.

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:36.500
Let me bait you up again.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:37.916
Okay.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.041
Okay, cast away.

01:00:44.333 --> 01:00:45.833
Nice cast.

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:47.458
Thanks.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.416
- This is kind of fun.
- Yeah, it is.

01:00:50.791 --> 01:00:53.708
That's what happens when
we put our differences aside, you see?

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:56.208
How are they biting?

01:00:57.125 --> 01:00:58.208
Pretty good.

01:00:58.458 --> 01:00:59.750
Caught a couple of nice ones.

01:00:59.958 --> 01:01:01.166
Good for you.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:02.625
That's probably because

01:01:02.708 --> 01:01:04.416
not too many people fish here,

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:06.625
it being illegal and all.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.416
- What?
- What?

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.875
You could ask the ranger.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.083
Here he comes now.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.833
Dump the fish.

01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:17.791
- But those are our fish!
- Dump the fish!

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.541
- Why?
- Dump them!

01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:23.250
The cooler!

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:24.500
Forget the cooler.

01:01:27.875 --> 01:01:29.958
You are in violation
of the law!

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.500
He's gaining on us.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.583
He's gaining on us.

01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:45.916
What are you doing?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.333
I got to call Chuck
to pick us up.

01:01:47.416 --> 01:01:48.541
He left us?

01:01:48.791 --> 01:01:50.208
What kind of friend is that?

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:52.291
Friend? He's my Lyft driver.
I don't know the guy.

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.000
Pull over or face the consequences!

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:56.916
Brace yourself.
We're coming in hot.

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:02.041
Grandpa, come on!

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.333
Hey, why didn't you tell us
there was no fishing?

01:02:04.708 --> 01:02:06.708
You wouldn't have rented the boat!

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:23.833
Hey! Stop!

01:02:23.916 --> 01:02:25.333
Hold it!

01:02:29.416 --> 01:02:31.750
- That was so cool.
- Yeah, that was.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:35.208
But breaking the law is wrong.
You know that, right?

01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:37.791
Yeah, I know.

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:38.958
Mmm.

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:45.625
Pull over here, Chuck.

01:02:45.791 --> 01:02:48.208
I want to show you something, Pete.

01:02:49.125 --> 01:02:50.500
So, this house...

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:52.458
This house for sale,
I built it.

01:02:52.541 --> 01:02:53.791
They changed the color.
I don't like that.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:54.916
What do you think?

01:02:55.583 --> 01:02:56.875
I like it.

01:02:57.791 --> 01:02:59.416
Maybe it's not so bad.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.916
You know,
over the years,

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:04.208
if I wasn't feeling so good,

01:03:05.083 --> 01:03:07.916
I'd come by, and I'd...
I'd take a look.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:10.958
I'd see people living
in the thing I built,

01:03:11.125 --> 01:03:13.541
raising families,
making lives, and...

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:15.875
I'd feel better.

01:03:16.416 --> 01:03:17.875
You feel better now?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.750
Yeah, I do.

01:03:20.625 --> 01:03:22.458
Hey, do you want to know a secret?

01:03:22.541 --> 01:03:23.708
Yeah.

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:24.916
Come on.

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:31.625
People who build houses
usually sign their work,

01:03:31.708 --> 01:03:33.125
like an artist
signs a painting.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.208
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.791
But it's always hidden.

01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:38.916
Yeah.

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:42.208
Some guys sign their name
on a rafter.

01:03:42.291 --> 01:03:44.083
Others put something
under the floorboards,

01:03:44.166 --> 01:03:46.625
like a newspaper with the date
the house was finished.

01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:48.875
One guy I knew used to
write a poem

01:03:48.958 --> 01:03:51.250
on the bottom of a toilet
before he installed it.

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.041
- What did you do?
- Me?

01:03:55.125 --> 01:03:57.208
Well, I always had
one of my guys

01:03:57.291 --> 01:03:58.833
take a picture of me
and your grandmother,

01:03:58.916 --> 01:04:00.250
and then I would
seal the picture

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:02.583
inside the wall
next to the fireplace.

01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:05.125
So, there are photos of me
and your grandmother

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.791
inside walls
all over this part of the city.

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:09.750
Nobody knows but you.

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:12.416
And now you do.

01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:15.000
That's cool.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:16.208
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:25.833
We'll make an angler
out of you yet, kid.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.750
Maybe next time,
we can actually find a lake

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:28.958
where they let us fish.

01:04:29.041 --> 01:04:30.291
Oh, yeah, there are plenty of lakes

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:31.625
brimming with bass around here, Pete.

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:33.208
Yeah. Fat ones, too.

01:04:33.291 --> 01:04:34.833
Yeah, whoppers.

01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:37.958
- Grandpa?
- Yeah, Pete.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.958
Thank you for
taking me fishing.

01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:41.708
I had a really great time.

01:04:42.041 --> 01:04:44.166
You're welcome.
I had a great time, too.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.666
Let's do it more often.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:47.125
Yeah.

01:04:47.291 --> 01:04:48.750
Sure.

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:52.291
See you at dinner.

01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:57.458
That's good.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:59.541
You got me.
You got me good.

01:04:59.875 --> 01:05:01.125
You're a dead man.

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:08.458
Oops!

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:10.416
- Ow!
- That happened.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.083
Not again.

01:05:21.541 --> 01:05:22.666
Oops.

01:05:23.208 --> 01:05:24.416
That happened.

01:05:33.708 --> 01:05:36.875
Okay, so I'm gonna
put the Santa hat

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:38.583
right here.

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:40.958
Did you put the words
in that one?

01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:42.958
I'm doing that right now.

01:05:43.041 --> 01:05:45.458
"Come celebrate
Jennifer's super fun,

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:48.000
"Christmas-theme
birthday party."

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.333
- Great job.
- Like it?

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:53.291
Love it.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:05.541
Is this seat open?

01:06:09.125 --> 01:06:10.958
Thanks, Ed,
for coming with me.

01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:13.041
These things are never
fun to go to alone.

01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:17.333
Carl was one of my longtime
adventure buddies.

01:06:17.416 --> 01:06:19.541
Gonna miss the old hell-raiser.

01:06:19.708 --> 01:06:21.958
How did he, you know, uh...

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.666
In his sleep.

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:25.875
While skydiving.

01:06:27.541 --> 01:06:28.875
Looking good, bro.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.916
So, did you come here alone?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.708
That's my husband.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.333
Mmm.

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:38.000
Probably need a ride, huh?

01:06:38.416 --> 01:06:40.500
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:42.208
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.166
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:47.083
- <i>Ya like to</i>
- <i>Move it!</i>

01:06:47.166 --> 01:06:48.791
What the...

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.333
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:06:50.416 --> 01:06:52.375
Sorry.

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:53.458
<i>Ya like to...</i>

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.125
Shoot.

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:59.125
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.791
<i>I like to move it, move it</i>

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.833
<i>I like to move it, move it...</i>

01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:06.000
What the...

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:08.250
<i>I like to move it, move it,
I like to move it, move it...</i>

01:07:08.416 --> 01:07:10.250
Sorry about this, Carl.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:17.416
<i>I like to move it, move it...</i>

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:20.041
I don't know this guy.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:22.166
<i>Move it, move it, ya like to</i>

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.166
- <i>Move it!</i>
- <i>I like to...</i>

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:47.125
So, Grandpa,
how was that funeral yesterday?

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.208
Really nice.

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:50.458
Thanks for asking.

01:07:51.083 --> 01:07:53.583
How about you?
Anything exciting happen at school?

01:07:53.666 --> 01:07:54.666
No.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.791
Unless you call
getting punched in the face

01:07:56.875 --> 01:07:58.666
by a giant eighth-grader exciting.

01:07:58.958 --> 01:07:59.958
Really?

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.333
Yep.

01:08:01.416 --> 01:08:03.458
- What happened?
- He was blasted into a giant

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:06.291
orangesicle...
as soon as he opened up my backpack.

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.458
It's so weird, right?

01:08:09.623 --> 01:08:10.666
Hello, boys!

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:12.875
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey...

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:14.500
Let me set this stuff down,
and I'll help you

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:15.833
put the lights on the roof
there, Ed.

01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:17.125
Thanks, Arthur.

01:08:18.663 --> 01:08:19.957
I said "Arthur."

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:23.082
Don't you two make
a nice team.

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:25.750
Jenny's birthday's gonna be
so exciting.

01:08:25.957 --> 01:08:28.207
All that's left to do
is try to find a Santa Claus

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:30.167
in early September,
and we'll be golden.

01:08:30.417 --> 01:08:31.625
Don't you worry yourself.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.372
I know Santa personally.

01:08:33.457 --> 01:08:34.750
Consider it done.

01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:36.250
Aw!

01:08:36.497 --> 01:08:37.957
Thanks, Dad.
That's so sweet.

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:40.125
It's the least I can do for Jenny.

01:08:41.541 --> 01:08:45.000
Mom, before you say no,
hear me out.

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:47.832
Can Russell come
to Jennifer's birthday party?

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:50.000
- No.
- What?

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:52.582
Why? Peter's friends get to go.

01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:54.207
That reminds me,
I invited Jerry

01:08:54.292 --> 01:08:55.457
and the crew,
if that's okay.

01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:57.042
No, that's great.

01:08:57.125 --> 01:08:58.875
And you don't see
how unfair this is?

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:02.125
I hate you!

01:09:04.457 --> 01:09:06.125
I don't want to hear it.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:08.247
Hey, Peter.

01:09:08.332 --> 01:09:09.707
Yeah?

01:09:11.250 --> 01:09:13.207
Listen... You know,

01:09:13.292 --> 01:09:16.457
in World War I,
the Germans and the British

01:09:16.538 --> 01:09:18.292
put down their weapons
on Christmas Eve

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:20.125
in favor of celebrating
rather than fighting

01:09:20.207 --> 01:09:21.497
- during the holiday.
- Hmm.

01:09:21.582 --> 01:09:24.332
Your sister's birthday
is a special occasion

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.917
and should be celebrated.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:27.500
I guess you're right.

01:09:27.582 --> 01:09:29.082
Okay, then let's agree...

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:31.500
Temporary armistice for Jenny.

01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:33.792
Deal?

01:09:35.207 --> 01:09:36.750
Deal.

01:09:45.082 --> 01:09:46.792
Please! Stop it.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:52.457
Ow! Cut it out!

01:09:52.541 --> 01:09:54.541
- You're hurting me.
- "You're hurting me."

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.125
That looks like fun.

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:58.957
Yeah, lots of fun.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.250
We like fun, too.

01:10:03.582 --> 01:10:05.707
Forgot I had detention today.

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.125
Looks like you're on your own.

01:10:08.582 --> 01:10:09.582
I have a question.

01:10:09.666 --> 01:10:11.625
Do you know my grandson
Peter Decker?

01:10:13.457 --> 01:10:14.832
Thought so.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.125
- Dumpster.
- What? Wait, wait.

01:10:20.208 --> 01:10:22.707
Don't make this harder
than it has to be, kid.

01:10:22.792 --> 01:10:25.375
Come on,
take your lumps like a man.

01:10:25.457 --> 01:10:27.208
- Who are you guys?
- Come on.

01:10:27.375 --> 01:10:29.042
Disciplinary board.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:33.125
Leave Peter alone,
understood?

01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:34.792
Whoa! Ripe.

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:36.917
Not your lucky day,
tough guy.

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:38.250
- Get him in there.
- No!

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:39.375
No! Don't...

01:10:39.457 --> 01:10:40.750
No!

01:10:41.625 --> 01:10:43.582
Nasty!

01:10:43.792 --> 01:10:45.208
Get me out of here!

01:10:46.792 --> 01:10:48.125
Hello?

01:10:50.457 --> 01:10:51.457
Wow!

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:56.167
Merry birthday, sweetheart.

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.625
<i>Hey</i>

01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:03.457
<i>Ooh, hoo</i>

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:06.917
<i>Hurry home and come round here</i>

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.208
<i>I really love
this time of year</i>

01:11:10.292 --> 01:11:12.832
<i>Making plans
to get together</i>

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:16.208
<i>Memories that will
last forever</i>

01:11:16.292 --> 01:11:18.957
<i>Sharing laughter and
sharing joy</i>

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.875
<i>Everyone is singing,
all the girls and boys</i>

01:11:22.042 --> 01:11:24.875
<i>Some kind of magic
is in the air</i>

01:11:24.957 --> 01:11:28.416
<i>To make a special moment
we can share</i>

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.457
<i>The snow is falling...</i>

01:11:30.832 --> 01:11:32.500
It's quiet.

01:11:32.582 --> 01:11:33.832
Too quiet.

01:11:33.917 --> 01:11:35.125
Billy, they agreed.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.792
His grandpa's not gonna do anything.

01:11:37.042 --> 01:11:38.917
If my grandpa makes a move,
I'll be ready.

01:11:39.917 --> 01:11:41.208
See that Santa chair?

01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:42.375
Yeah.

01:11:42.582 --> 01:11:43.875
I booby-trapped it.

01:11:44.332 --> 01:11:46.292
Did somebody say "boobies"?

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.000
Go away, Steve.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:51.416
This eggnog tastes funny.

01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:53.792
Let me fix it for you.

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:55.375
Ooh!

01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:01.875
Hey, everybody!

01:12:02.208 --> 01:12:03.832
Guess who's here!

01:12:03.917 --> 01:12:06.083
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas.

01:12:06.167 --> 01:12:07.582
Here comes Santa.

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:10.792
Santa!

01:12:10.875 --> 01:12:12.792
Better watch out,
better not pout.

01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:14.958
I got toys and goodies.
I got everything.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.375
Wait a sec.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:18.083
That's not my grandpa.

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:19.917
Ed?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.083
No, thanks.
Got to stay alert.

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:23.875
Just in case.

01:12:23.958 --> 01:12:26.582
Kid wouldn't have the <i>cojones</i>
to do anything. You shook on it.

01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:28.457
You never know.
You can't trust these kids.

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:30.167
Hey, Grandpa.

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.457
Hey. Nice party, huh, pal?

01:12:32.541 --> 01:12:34.125
Sure is, buddy.

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:36.291
But I thought
you were playing Santa Claus.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:38.792
Me? Oh, no,
I leave that to the professionals.

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:41.332
Jerry's been a mall Santa
ever since he retired.

01:12:41.832 --> 01:12:43.457
That a problem, Pete?

01:12:43.541 --> 01:12:44.750
Why would that be a problem?

01:12:44.832 --> 01:12:46.083
Just asking.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.250
Hey, you want to get me
one of those sodas over there?

01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:55.042
Thanks, kiddo.

01:12:56.582 --> 01:12:58.167
Kid's up to something.
I can feel it.

01:13:02.291 --> 01:13:03.832
Probably just a coincidence.

01:13:07.167 --> 01:13:08.291
Ho, ho, ho!

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.167
And what's your name?

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:11.667
Let me guess.

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:13.750
It wasn't a name
20 years ago.

01:13:13.832 --> 01:13:15.332
- Am I right?
- Peter?

01:13:15.792 --> 01:13:17.707
- Dad, what's up?
- You know where Mia is?

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.375
She's supposed to help me
with the hot dogs.

01:13:19.457 --> 01:13:20.667
Nope.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:22.042
Well, hey, come on.
I could use your help.

01:13:31.167 --> 01:13:32.875
Hey, Grandpa.

01:13:32.958 --> 01:13:34.958
What happened to you?
You're all wet.

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:37.667
Some questions don't have answers, Pete.

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:39.500
Hey, cookie?

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.542
- No, it's okay.
- Oh, they're delicious.

01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:43.875
- No, it's really fine.
- Especially this one.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:45.958
- I'm good.
- You sure?

01:13:46.042 --> 01:13:47.582
I'm sure.

01:13:49.291 --> 01:13:51.042
Want to help me get some
mustard and ketchup on these

01:13:51.125 --> 01:13:53.083
bad boys and get 'em out to
the kids before they get cold?

01:13:53.375 --> 01:13:54.707
Sounds good, Dad.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:56.416
I'll do the front row,
you do the back?

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.332
You're the boss.

01:14:01.457 --> 01:14:03.917
I'm so sorry.
That just slipped.

01:14:05.083 --> 01:14:06.833
I swear,
I didn't mean to do that.

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:09.542
What are you gonna do?

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:13.166
Oh, darn.

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:14.917
Bottles must be overly full.

01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:18.166
Hey, Dad? The Christmas lights
are on the fritz again.

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:21.000
- Could you check on them?
- I'm on it.

01:14:21.083 --> 01:14:24.000
Yeah, and, Peter, check on the air pump
for the bouncy house.

01:14:24.083 --> 01:14:26.291
Could be a little bit... bouncier.

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.375
What the heck
is he up to now?

01:15:02.542 --> 01:15:04.582
Grandpa!

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.792
Dad! Dad!

01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:09.833
Dad?

01:15:09.917 --> 01:15:11.582
Are you all right?

01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:16.375
I'm okay.
Found a quarter in here.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500
Peter, we said no pranks.

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.792
We shook hands on it, man-to-man.
What happened?

01:15:22.875 --> 01:15:24.707
What are you talking about?

01:15:24.792 --> 01:15:26.750
Grandpa, I swear, I didn't do that.

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:28.375
Whoa!

01:15:31.833 --> 01:15:33.667
Santa's dead!

01:15:35.082 --> 01:15:37.166
Okay.
I might have did that.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:38.792
That's not good.

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:45.917
Danny, Ed, did you see that?

01:15:47.207 --> 01:15:48.582
Epic.

01:15:49.582 --> 01:15:50.958
Here comes Santa.

01:15:51.457 --> 01:15:53.250
Ho, ho, ho.

01:15:56.166 --> 01:15:57.875
- My franks.
- Jerry!

01:15:57.958 --> 01:15:59.958
- Jerry, you all right?
- What happened?

01:16:02.417 --> 01:16:03.542
Fire!

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:05.792
Everybody get back!
I got this!

01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:09.375
- Dad, I'll get the hose.
- Okay.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.542
All right, pull the pin.
Got it.

01:16:12.457 --> 01:16:14.708
"Point away from face..."

01:16:15.375 --> 01:16:16.625
I'm blind!

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.667
I'm blind!

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:22.207
I got it.

01:16:23.417 --> 01:16:24.917
Grandpa, get out of the way!

01:16:35.792 --> 01:16:37.207
My Christmas tree.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.582
My Christmas birthday cake.

01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:45.833
Oh! What have we done?

01:17:02.917 --> 01:17:03.958
No, no, no, no!

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:11.457
Peter!

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:19.958
Hi, Mom.

01:17:20.041 --> 01:17:21.542
Mia?

01:17:21.625 --> 01:17:22.958
Russell!

01:17:25.291 --> 01:17:27.000
Don't you run away,
Russell!

01:17:28.625 --> 01:17:29.875
Nothing happened.

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:33.082
Okay, this is not my fault.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.625
Little help? Anybody?

01:17:45.582 --> 01:17:48.166
That's a pretty good scrape there,
Mr. Marino.

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:49.792
Yeah?
You should see the tree.

01:17:50.792 --> 01:17:52.166
Thank you.

01:17:54.667 --> 01:17:57.000
What? What? It's nothing.
I'll be all right.

01:17:57.082 --> 01:17:59.750
Sure, you'll be all right.
Dad's always all right.

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:02.332
Doesn't need anyone's help
or love.

01:18:02.875 --> 01:18:04.125
Oh, Sally, please, come on.

01:18:04.207 --> 01:18:06.417
- You could've been killed, Dad.
- Come on.

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.166
You're overdramatizing.
It was an accident. That's all.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.875
- An accident?
- Yeah.

01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:13.750
What, you think I don't know
about the war, Dad?

01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:16.417
Or should I say
"Senior Soldier"?

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.708
Oh... That.

01:18:17.792 --> 01:18:19.125
What were you two thinking?

01:18:19.207 --> 01:18:21.292
Don't blame the kid, Sally.
Please.

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:23.000
It's all on me.
I'm the grown-up here,

01:18:23.082 --> 01:18:24.792
- and I should know better.
- Yeah, you should've.

01:18:24.875 --> 01:18:26.792
I'm sorry. I just...
It got out of hand, and...

01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:28.792
I have the money
to pay for everything.

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:32.417
And I'll take my crew,
and we'll fix everything the way it was.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.792
It's not about the house
or the money, Dad.

01:18:35.332 --> 01:18:38.250
If you hated living with us so much,
you just should've said it.

01:18:38.332 --> 01:18:40.250
I never said I hated living with you.

01:18:40.332 --> 01:18:41.916
Exactly.
I just said you never said it.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.916
What I'm saying, I never said that.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.082
We clear that up, hopefully?

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:49.332
No. Forget about
what you never said.

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.041
The point is, I just thought

01:18:52.125 --> 01:18:55.000
when you came home with us,
you'd realize that we love you

01:18:55.082 --> 01:18:56.875
and you'd change your mind
about living alone.

01:18:56.957 --> 01:18:59.332
But, of course,
that didn't happen.

01:18:59.417 --> 01:19:01.625
You're just so hell-bent on...

01:19:03.792 --> 01:19:06.375
funning it up.

01:19:06.457 --> 01:19:09.166
- Are you okay, Grandpa?
- Yeah. Grandpa's fine.

01:19:09.250 --> 01:19:11.166
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm really sorry

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.792
about what happened
at your birthday party.

01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:14.000
It's okay.

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:16.125
I brought you something
to make you feel better.

01:19:16.207 --> 01:19:19.750
That's very nice, but I gave
that to you, remember?

01:19:19.833 --> 01:19:21.000
Don't you want it?

01:19:21.082 --> 01:19:23.125
I think you need it more.

01:19:23.207 --> 01:19:25.207
We can call it a loan.

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:28.375
That's very adult of you,
sweetheart.

01:19:29.916 --> 01:19:31.667
You'll be able to
take him home soon.

01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:34.667
The doctor just needs
to review the X-rays.

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.708
We'll be in the waiting room.

01:19:50.957 --> 01:19:52.250
Can I go see him now?

01:19:52.332 --> 01:19:54.916
No. It'll be a long time

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.500
before we leave the two of you
alone together again, ever.

01:19:58.583 --> 01:19:59.832
Is he gonna be okay?

01:19:59.916 --> 01:20:01.625
He'll be fine.
You and Mia, on the other hand,

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.041
that's a different story.

01:20:03.457 --> 01:20:05.292
You're both chor-rounded
for the next six months.

01:20:05.417 --> 01:20:07.667
Chor-rounded?
What does that even mean?

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:10.708
Chores plus grounded,
times six months.

01:20:10.792 --> 01:20:12.167
- What?
- Yeah.

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:14.500
- So, that's a whole lot of both, isn't it?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:20:14.792 --> 01:20:17.000
But I didn't even do half
of the stuff that Peter did.

01:20:17.082 --> 01:20:18.583
This is so not fair.

01:20:18.667 --> 01:20:20.332
Can I be chor-rounded, too?

01:20:20.417 --> 01:20:22.957
No, sweetie,
you don't have to be chor-rounded.

01:20:26.625 --> 01:20:27.625
Russell.

01:20:30.583 --> 01:20:33.125
- Don't you move a muscle.
- Wait.

01:20:34.082 --> 01:20:35.750
- Wait, Mom! Come on!
- Russell!

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.667
Dad, can you think rationally about...

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:39.875
- Russell!
- She said not to move.

01:20:40.167 --> 01:20:42.167
- Russell!
- Get away from me!

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:51.041
Get back here, you coward!

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:53.875
Punk!

01:20:53.957 --> 01:20:56.250
Okay, that's it.
Mom is certifiably insane.

01:20:56.332 --> 01:20:58.542
- I'm going out there.
- Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:01.207
I know your mother.
She can handle this.

01:21:10.375 --> 01:21:12.458
You're not gonna slug me,
are you, Mrs. Decker?

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:16.082
No.

01:21:21.832 --> 01:21:23.250
What's happening right now?

01:21:24.082 --> 01:21:25.625
What's happening right now is

01:21:25.708 --> 01:21:28.292
I'm not gonna lose two years
of my daughter, Russell.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.957
Come on, take it
before I change my mind.

01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:36.332
Come by the house tomorrow.

01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:37.832
- Really?
- Yep.

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.417
And bring some work clothes.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:45.082
I've got this giant hole
in the second floor, needs fixing.

01:21:48.875 --> 01:21:50.250
Okay.

01:21:51.292 --> 01:21:52.500
How'd that go?

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:54.500
Thanks a lot, Mom.

01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:55.957
I didn't hurt him.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:21:57.375
Mmm-hmm.

01:21:57.875 --> 01:22:00.167
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.332
Let's go get Grandpa
and go home.

01:22:06.207 --> 01:22:09.542
Excuse me. Can you check on Mr. Marino,
see if he's ready to go?

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:10.957
Oh, he left already.

01:22:11.583 --> 01:22:12.916
I thought you all left.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.625
He said his brother
was picking him up.

01:22:15.042 --> 01:22:16.542
- Brother?
- Yeah.

01:22:17.417 --> 01:22:18.542
Chuck?

01:22:19.542 --> 01:22:20.832
Chuck.

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:22.332
Who's Chuck?

01:22:27.957 --> 01:22:30.000
- Dad?
- Ed?

01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:33.333
- Grandpa!
- Grandpa!

01:22:34.707 --> 01:22:37.082
- Grandpa?
- Grandpa!

01:22:38.542 --> 01:22:39.666
- Ed?
- Dad?

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:40.875
Grandpa!

01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:45.500
- Dad?
- Mom!

01:22:59.292 --> 01:23:01.625
I just got off the phone with Jerry.
He hasn't seen him.

01:23:01.707 --> 01:23:03.167
I shouldn't have
laid into him so hard.

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:06.583
It's Peter's fault.
He made Grandpa run away.

01:23:06.666 --> 01:23:09.125
Yeah, Peter, but at least
you got your room back.

01:23:09.207 --> 01:23:11.292
Happy now?

01:23:11.375 --> 01:23:13.333
Peter, you still with us?

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.500
I think I know where
Grandpa went.

01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:23.832
I like the fireplace a lot.

01:23:25.042 --> 01:23:27.082
They don't make 'em like this anymore.

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.207
Thanks.

01:23:29.292 --> 01:23:32.207
You know, there are secrets
inside these walls.

01:23:32.542 --> 01:23:34.750
- Oh. Hmm.
- Hmm.

01:23:40.375 --> 01:23:41.791
Wait.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.957
I started this.

01:23:44.666 --> 01:23:46.666
I'd like to be the one to end it.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.750
Hi, Chuck.

01:24:03.375 --> 01:24:04.375
Grandpa.

01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:07.000
- Peter.
- Um... What's going on?

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:11.207
- You moved out of your room.
- It's your room, kiddo.

01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:12.666
It always was.

01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:15.917
I decided...
I want you to have it.

01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:18.832
I don't want you to leave, Grandpa.

01:24:18.917 --> 01:24:22.082
Peter, I think we both know
the room will always be between us.

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:24.791
No, it won't. Besides,
I love the attic.

01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:28.500
I don't know why I got mad about
that old, smelly room in the first place.

01:24:28.582 --> 01:24:29.875
Honest.

01:24:29.957 --> 01:24:32.082
So you've got to come back.

01:24:34.666 --> 01:24:36.250
It's not that easy, kiddo.

01:24:36.333 --> 01:24:38.167
I'll do anything.

01:24:38.250 --> 01:24:41.000
I'll get back every marble
for you. I swear.

01:24:41.832 --> 01:24:43.250
Oh... Pete.

01:24:44.208 --> 01:24:45.625
Grandpa, please.

01:24:45.707 --> 01:24:47.582
I feel so ashamed of how I acted.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:50.208
I just want to curl up
in a ball and die.

01:24:50.917 --> 01:24:52.832
It's all my fault.

01:24:52.917 --> 01:24:56.208
No. Don't you believe that
for one second. It's both our faults.

01:24:56.292 --> 01:24:58.666
You were just defending
what was yours.

01:25:00.082 --> 01:25:03.917
Maybe this is how wars get started
and just go on and on.

01:25:05.666 --> 01:25:10.666
Your enemy does something bad to you,
so you do something worse back to him.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.000
And he gets you back,
and you get him back.

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.417
And the whole thing
just gets worse and worse.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:19.292
And in the end,
somebody just drops a bomb.

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:24.250
- Isn't that how it happens?
- That's how it happens.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.458
I don't ever want to go to war.

01:25:27.541 --> 01:25:31.250
I'm very glad to hear you say that,
and I hope to God you never have to.

01:25:33.582 --> 01:25:35.957
Can I tell you something, though?

01:25:36.042 --> 01:25:39.666
I kind of enjoyed matching wits
with a fellow crazy man.

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:41.375
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:25:42.082 --> 01:25:44.957
It helped me get over
my sadness for your grandmother.

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:48.707
Plus,
you got me pretty good a couple times.

01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:50.750
Not as good as you got me.

01:25:52.125 --> 01:25:53.792
Yeah.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.333
Please come home, Grandpa.

01:25:58.333 --> 01:26:00.125
Come here.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:22.500
All righty, Mr. Decker,
if you'll sign right there.

01:26:22.582 --> 01:26:24.875
You know, I was gonna
cut this tree down myself.

01:26:24.957 --> 01:26:28.125
But my wife,
with the whole chain saw thing.

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:31.125
You know,
I can use a chain saw any time I want.

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:32.625
Yeah.
I believe that, man.

01:26:32.707 --> 01:26:34.125
Here, if you need anything else,

01:26:34.208 --> 01:26:35.582
just give me a call
at the office, all right?

01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:37.875
Yeah. I mean,
I can use it any time I want.

01:26:37.957 --> 01:26:40.333
- Yeah. Have some dignity.
- It's just a chain saw.

01:26:40.416 --> 01:26:42.333
Why? Did she say something?

01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:19.457
Hey, Grandpa.
I'm ready to go fishing.

01:27:20.208 --> 01:27:23.582
Oh, Petey, I guess I forgot to tell you,
I can't take you fishing today.

01:27:23.666 --> 01:27:26.666
Why? It's Saturday.
We always go fishing. It's our thing.

01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:29.292
I know. We do, kiddo,
and I wish I could,

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:31.750
but I made other plans,
but we'll make up for it.

01:27:31.832 --> 01:27:33.208
Like what?

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.125
Little matinee,
maybe hit that new gelato place.

01:27:39.875 --> 01:27:41.957
See? That's for me.
Got to go.

01:27:42.416 --> 01:27:44.042
We'll make up for it.

01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:01.500
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, just Peter.

01:28:08.292 --> 01:28:09.375
We should go.

01:30:27.216 --> 01:30:28.759
Grandpa! Grandpa!

01:30:28.841 --> 01:30:29.841
Hi, Grandpa.

01:30:30.341 --> 01:30:34.216
<i>Uh, huh, oh, oh, oh</i>

01:30:35.966 --> 01:30:38.759
- <i>War</i>
- <i>What is it really good for</i>

01:30:38.841 --> 01:30:39.841
See?

01:30:39.925 --> 01:30:41.132
<i>Show me the point of war</i>

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.591
<i>So many lives were torn apart
because of war</i>

01:30:46.675 --> 01:30:48.634
<i>It doesn't make sense to me</i>

01:30:48.716 --> 01:30:50.925
- <i>It doesn't make sense to</i>
- <i>War</i>

01:30:51.675 --> 01:30:53.634
<i>It doesn't make sense to me</i>

01:30:53.716 --> 01:30:55.675
<i>It doesn't make sense at all</i>

01:30:55.759 --> 01:31:00.507
<i>Life in this world could be
so beautiful</i>

01:31:00.966 --> 01:31:05.716
<i>If it wasn't for some people
acting miserable</i>

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.132
<i>Too many of these countries</i>

01:31:07.216 --> 01:31:08.507
Look at that.

01:31:08.591 --> 01:31:09.841
<i>Are political</i>

01:31:09.925 --> 01:31:11.507
<i>And we're stuck in the middle</i>

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:12.966
- <i>Stuck in the middle</i>
- <i>Oh</i>

01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:14.591
<i>We just need to let go</i>

01:31:16.132 --> 01:31:18.716
<i>All these wars leave a mess</i>

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.466
<i>Everyone's under stress</i>

01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:22.507
<i>Living life with regrets</i>

01:31:24.216 --> 01:31:25.507
- Too much?
- We're good!

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:29.800
Oh!

01:31:30.884 --> 01:31:33.257
<i>And the pain tears us down</i>

01:31:35.634 --> 01:31:38.841
- <i>War</i>
- <i>What is it really good for?</i>

01:31:38.925 --> 01:31:41.382
<i>Show me the point of war</i>

01:31:41.466 --> 01:31:46.050
<i>So many lives were torn apart
because of war</i>

01:31:46.759 --> 01:31:48.675
<i>Doesn't make sense to me</i>

01:31:48.759 --> 01:31:50.800
- <i>Doesn't make sense to</i>
- <i>War</i>

01:31:50.925 --> 01:31:52.050
Another one.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:53.925
<i>Doesn't make sense to me</i>

01:31:55.466 --> 01:31:56.550
I just saw your...

01:31:56.925 --> 01:31:58.466
I like it.
Get the blood flow.

01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:59.550
<i>So uncomfortable...</i>

01:31:59.634 --> 01:32:01.050
My...

01:32:01.132 --> 01:32:03.300
Russell. Russell! Russell.

01:32:03.382 --> 01:32:05.132
I didn't know that made the cut.

01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:15.591
Got something in my throat.

01:32:15.675 --> 01:32:17.425
<i>All these wars leave a mess...</i>

01:32:25.050 --> 01:32:26.966
What, did he move?

01:32:28.591 --> 01:32:30.591
Golly, he's still alive.

01:32:33.257 --> 01:32:34.882
Tune in to the next episode of...

01:32:38.550 --> 01:32:40.425
Let me do that again.

01:32:40.882 --> 01:32:43.509
Hey. How can I help you?

01:32:43.591 --> 01:32:45.966
How can I doobie-do ya?
How can I help you out?

01:32:46.050 --> 01:32:48.175
Doobie, doobie, doobie.
Yeah!

01:32:55.509 --> 01:32:56.634
Oh, come on.

01:32:56.716 --> 01:32:58.050
Crawling up my back.

01:32:59.050 --> 01:33:00.716
And you actually
ride that thing?

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:02.425
Hells yes. Fun.

01:33:02.509 --> 01:33:04.591
F-U-N-N.

01:33:04.675 --> 01:33:06.007
Last time, again.

01:33:06.091 --> 01:33:07.425
What the hell is that?

01:33:07.509 --> 01:33:10.716
- I didn't know you were a Marine.
- I wasn't. I'm just saying.

01:33:11.591 --> 01:33:13.007
Get him in there.

01:33:13.132 --> 01:33:14.716
Come on.
I don't even know you guys.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.382
<i>Doesn't make sense at all</i>

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:17.634
All right.

01:33:17.716 --> 01:33:19.050
We got it.
I think we're good.

01:33:21.466 --> 01:33:23.550
I work for some
soul-sucking corporate firm

01:33:23.634 --> 01:33:26.634
that has no interest in
the cares or worries of its...

01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:29.257
Cutting.

01:33:29.341 --> 01:33:30.550
Good.

01:33:32.382 --> 01:33:33.675
Good talk.
