00:09.083 --> 00:10.272
Did you guys hear

00:10.273 --> 00:11.459
about that alien invasion?

00:13.292 --> 00:14.959
- Yeah, caught me
- by surprise, too.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.709
If we leave now

00:17.710 --> 00:19.042
they may not notice

00:16.375 --> 00:19.042
for at least a month.

00:19.083 --> 00:20.375
I'll race you to Miami!

00:22.751 --> 00:24.355
Ooh, how exciting!

00:24.356 --> 00:25.959
Our school is having

00:22.751 --> 00:25.959
try-outs

00:26.000 --> 00:27.314
for the Walden mascot,

00:27.315 --> 00:28.626
Waldorf the Wasp.

00:28.667 --> 00:29.730
You know, I was

00:29.731 --> 00:30.792

Yes, we know.

00:33.083 --> 00:34.959
Angus the Armadillo.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.209
When threatened,

00:36.210 --> 00:37.417
I'd roll over and play dead

00:35.000 --> 00:37.417
just like the football team.

00:38.709 --> 00:39.814
Perhaps dressing up

00:39.815 --> 00:40.918
like a giant wasp

00:40.959 --> 00:42.542
- and cheering
- for our sports team

and sauerkraut balls.

08:22.375 --> 08:23.418
They were my favorite

08:23.419 --> 08:24.459
snacks when I was

08:22.375 --> 08:24.459
stationed in Germany.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.250
If I eat that,

08:26.251 --> 08:27.500
I'll be stationed

08:25.000 --> 08:27.500
over the toilet.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.042
(TIMER BUZZING)

08:32.082 --> 08:33.500
- Time's up!
- I peeled 15!

08:35.125 --> 08:36.647
I peeled half a potato

08:36.648 --> 08:38.167
and six fingers.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.542
Aw, Zuri.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.917
Maybe a potato

08:42.918 --> 08:44.250
peeling race isn't

08:41.583 --> 08:44.250
a game for civilians.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.042
This was a game?

08:46.083 --> 08:47.523
- I thought we were
- being punished!

08:49.125 --> 08:50.125
I thought you were

08:50.126 --> 08:51.126
helping make dinner.

08:52.918 --> 08:55.083
- Okay! Ready for our next game,
- Clean the Latrine?

08:55.125 --> 08:56.626
Uh, no thanks.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.334
Besides, the latrines

08:58.335 --> 09:00.000
in this place are already

08:56.667 --> 09:00.000
ship-shape.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.772
Did you actually

09:01.773 --> 09:03.167
just compliment

09:00.375 --> 09:03.167
my cleaning skills?

09:03.626 --> 09:05.042
Doesn't everybody?

09:05.083 --> 09:06.375
No!

09:06.417 --> 09:07.417
I never thought

09:07.418 --> 09:08.417
I'd say this

09:06.417 --> 09:08.417
to a kid, but...

09:09.083 --> 09:11.000
- Would you like
- to stay for dinner?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.063
I'd love to,

09:13.064 --> 09:14.125
but I have to

09:12.000 --> 09:14.125
get back home.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.000
- My grandma loves
- mashed potatoes,

09:16.042 --> 09:17.393
- So do you mind
- if I take a few of these?

09:17.417 --> 09:19.209
Sure, but take Jessie's.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.000
They have less

09:17.417 --> 09:21.000
finger shavings.

09:22.500 --> 09:23.959
Bye.

09:24.042 --> 09:25.042
Oh.

09:26.918 --> 09:28.668
Jessie, you gotta stop

09:28.669 --> 09:30.417
recruiting me and Taylor

09:26.918 --> 09:30.417
for your weird military games.

09:30.459 --> 09:31.751
Don't you have

09:31.752 --> 09:33.042
other things to do?

09:30.459 --> 09:33.042
Yes.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.042
- Plan Taylor's
- birthday party!

09:35.083 --> 09:36.126
We're gonna play

09:36.127 --> 09:37.167
Pin the Stars

09:35.083 --> 09:37.167
on the General!

09:38.375 --> 09:39.647
Wait, how did you know

09:39.648 --> 09:40.918
it's Taylor's birthday?

09:40.959 --> 09:42.272
Her Grandma told me.

09:42.273 --> 09:43.584
She also knitted me this...

09:45.459 --> 09:47.042
Snake sweater?

09:47.083 --> 09:48.626
- I was going to say
- snorkel warmer,

09:48.667 --> 09:50.268
- But either way
- she needs a new hobby.

09:54.334 --> 09:55.792
I came up with

09:55.793 --> 09:57.250
a great theme for

09:54.334 --> 09:57.250
Taylor's birthday!

09:57.292 --> 09:58.542
So did I.

09:58.584 --> 09:59.792
Nothing says "birthday"

09:59.793 --> 10:01.000
like an obstacle course.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.167
Or we can do

10:03.168 --> 10:04.250
something fun

10:04.292 --> 10:05.646
that doesn't involve

10:05.647 --> 10:07.000
barbed wire, and mud.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.000
"Taylor's Twangy Tenth"?

10:11.042 --> 10:12.605
Yeah, it'll be a country

10:12.606 --> 10:14.167
music birthday blowout!

10:14.209 --> 10:16.146
Zuri, how are we going

10:16.147 --> 10:18.083
to get a mechanical bull

10:14.209 --> 10:18.083
into the living room?

10:18.125 --> 10:20.042
- Actually,
- it's a real bull.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.042
Since when do I bring

10:22.043 --> 10:24.000
fake giant animals into

10:20.083 --> 10:24.000
the pet house?

10:26.209 --> 10:27.376
Bertram, we need you

10:27.377 --> 10:28.542
to plan a party menu

10:28.584 --> 10:30.334
- for Taylor's first
- birthday in New York.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.709
Sure, anything for her!

10:32.710 --> 10:35.042
She complimented my latrines.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.083
That's what

10:36.084 --> 10:37.083
we call bathrooms.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.083
It's our thing.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.668
Please. You wouldn't know

10:39.669 --> 10:41.042
a latrine from a hole

10:38.292 --> 10:41.042
in the ground,

10:41.083 --> 10:42.125
which sometimes it is.

10:43.792 --> 10:45.643
- Taylor and I know that - because we
were both raised - In the military!

10:45.667 --> 10:46.667
Hey guys, what are

10:46.668 --> 10:47.668
you talking about?

10:47.709 --> 10:48.939
Believe it

10:48.940 --> 10:50.167
or not, toilets.

10:51.083 --> 10:52.126
Don't you mean

10:52.127 --> 10:53.167
latrines?

10:51.083 --> 10:53.167
Thank you!

10:54.459 --> 10:56.042
- Taylor!
- Guess what?

10:56.083 --> 10:57.334
We're throwing

10:57.335 --> 10:58.584
a birthday party

10:56.083 --> 10:58.584
for you!

10:58.626 --> 11:00.209
I wanted to tell her.

11:01.751 --> 11:03.897
Oh... That's nice,

11:03.898 --> 11:06.042
but I really don't want

11:01.751 --> 11:06.042
you to go to any trouble.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.376
No. It's no trouble!

11:07.377 --> 11:08.667
We'll have games,

11:08.709 --> 11:10.188
and decorations,

11:10.189 --> 11:11.667
and Bertram's gonna

11:08.709 --> 11:11.667
make a huge cake.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.460
And when he eats that,

11:13.461 --> 11:15.209
he'll make you another one!

11:16.792 --> 11:18.292
- There goes
- your corner slice.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.000
- And you can invite
- anyone you want.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.751
Doesn't that

11:26.752 --> 11:28.334
sound fun?

11:25.167 --> 11:28.334
No, it doesn't.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.834
I don't want a party.

11:29.835 --> 11:31.292
I don't even want

11:28.375 --> 11:31.292
a birthday!

11:36.417 --> 11:37.522
That was not

11:37.523 --> 11:38.626
the reaction

11:36.417 --> 11:38.626
I expected.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.167
Uh, Tony just called.

11:41.209 --> 11:42.605
Does anyone know

11:42.606 --> 11:44.000
anything about

11:41.209 --> 11:44.000
a bull delivery?

11:51.334 --> 11:52.810
- Then when we mentioned
- her birthday,

11:52.834 --> 11:53.918
Taylor burst into tears,

11:53.919 --> 11:55.000
and ran off.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.813
Taylor just misses

11:57.814 --> 11:59.250
her mother more

11:56.375 --> 11:59.250
than usual lately,

11:59.292 --> 12:00.501
what with her tenth

12:00.502 --> 12:01.709
birthday coming up.

12:01.751 --> 12:03.626
The big one-oh is huge.

12:04.919 --> 12:06.167
when you enter double digits.

12:07.250 --> 12:08.667
Look, I completely

12:08.668 --> 12:10.083
understand how

12:07.250 --> 12:10.083
Taylor feels.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.626
- When my dad was
- stationed overseas

12:11.667 --> 12:13.292
I missed him so much.

12:13.334 --> 12:15.042
- Most of all
- on special occasions.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.438
I know, Jessie.

12:16.439 --> 12:17.792
But this is about Taylor.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.584
So please don't tell

12:19.585 --> 12:21.042
the "Loneliest Snowman" story.

12:21.375 --> 12:22.855
What's that?

12:22.856 --> 12:24.334
No! Don't get

12:21.375 --> 12:24.334
her started!

12:26.083 --> 12:27.126
It was the first

12:27.127 --> 12:28.167
Christmas without Dad.

12:28.209 --> 12:29.251
The snow was high,

12:29.252 --> 12:30.292
the morale was low...

12:30.334 --> 12:32.292
Well, this has been fun...

12:32.334 --> 12:33.481
Okay, okay,

12:33.482 --> 12:34.626
I'll stop.

12:35.417 --> 12:36.896
Will you tell Taylor

12:36.897 --> 12:38.375
we're sorry we upset her,

12:38.417 --> 12:39.480
and anytime she wants,

12:39.481 --> 12:40.542
she can come over

12:40.584 --> 12:41.792
and make fun of Jessie

12:41.793 --> 12:43.000
playing Bugle Hero?

12:44.125 --> 12:46.083
- I sure will, pumpkin,
- and thank you.

12:47.292 --> 12:49.250
Wait a minute.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.250
- I think
- I have an idea.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.585
Zuri, I think it might be

12:54.586 --> 12:56.209
time to call in that big

12:52.959 --> 12:56.209

12:59.542 --> 13:02.292

13:06.752 --> 13:08.334
that you-know-who.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.125
- Who are you
- talking about?

13:11.542 --> 13:12.834
If you know Tom Selleck,

13:12.835 --> 13:14.125

13:31.083 --> 13:33.918
