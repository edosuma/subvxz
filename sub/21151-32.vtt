WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:07.508
>> PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"!
THE DUOS OF JOSH, MAVEN AND

00:07.541 --> 00:12.246
JALEX WERE LEFT IN THE GAME.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.784
AND PAUL WAS SECRETLY
ORCHESTRATING A WAR BETWEEN ALL

00:16.817 --> 00:17.751
THREE.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.189
>> ALEX AND JASON, THEY'RE THE
STRONGEST DUO.

00:21.222 --> 00:24.192
WE NEED TO SEPARATE THAT AS SOON
AS WE CAN FOR SURE.

00:24.225 --> 00:28.096
>> I SAID IT FROM DAY ONE.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.931
>> YOU AND JOSH NEED TO LAY LOW.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.900
>> I LOVE YOU, JASON JAY.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.868
>> WITH THE COWBOY RULING THE
ROOST --

00:34.902 --> 00:40.474
>> CONGRATULATIONS, JASON!
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF

00:40.508 --> 00:41.275
HOUSEHOLD.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.144
>> HE WAS GOING TO DRAW FIRST
BLOOD.

00:43.177 --> 00:47.248
>> I PUT MATT AND RAVEN ON THE
BLOCK.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.484
ALEX AND I HAVE THE DUO THING
COVERED.

00:50.518 --> 00:54.522
>> PAUL MADE MAVEN BELIEVE KEVIN
WAS THE REAL TARGET.

00:54.555 --> 00:58.326
>> WE JUST GOT TO WIN VETO.

00:58.359 --> 01:03.264
>> SO THEY FELT GREAT ABOUT
GOING ON THE BLOCK.

01:03.297 --> 01:10.138
>> I NOMINATE YOU RAVEN AND YOU,
MATT.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.040
>> IT'S NERVE RACKING BEING ON
BLOCK.

01:13.073 --> 01:17.411
I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT ON THE
BLACK WITH MY MAN MATT COME

01:17.445 --> 01:19.046
THURSDAY.
>> AFTER JASON SECURED MORE

01:19.079 --> 01:22.316
POWER --
>> JASON, CONGRATULATIONS.

01:22.350 --> 01:28.656
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF VETO.

01:28.689 --> 01:33.794
>> HE REVEALED HIS TRUE
INTENTIONS TO THE STAR-CROSSED

01:33.827 --> 01:34.728
LOVERS.

01:34.762 --> 01:39.367
>> I DECIDED NOT TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.001
>> AND A ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.071
>> YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO
PULL ONE OF US DOWN.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.206
YOU SAID THAT.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.407
>> I DON'T REMEMBER SAYING THAT.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.476
>> OH, MY GOD.

01:48.509 --> 01:52.313
YOU'RE A PUNK BITCH.
>> AFTER THE DUST SETTLED, KEVIN

01:52.346 --> 01:53.881
WAS CAUGHT CONVERSING WITH MATT.

01:53.914 --> 01:57.017
>> I DIDN'T VOTE AGAINST YOU.

01:57.050 --> 01:57.851
>> I DON'T CARE.

01:57.885 --> 02:04.725
>> SO JOSH TRIED TO CALL HIM
OUT.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.360
>> YOU PLAYED YOURSELF.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.229
I WON'T ANSWER YOUR
CONVERSATION.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.096
>> YOU'RE A LIAR.

02:09.129 --> 02:09.730
>> NO.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.566
YOU BETTER BE COOL.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.202
>> AND KEVIN LOST IT.

02:14.235 --> 02:17.638
>> SWEAR ON YOUR KIDS.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.407
>> DON'T BRING MY  KIDS
NAME IN IT.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.441
>> YOU'RE LYING.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.475
>> IT'S A GAME.

02:21.509 --> 02:25.045
>> KEVIN, COME ON.
>> IT LOOKED LIKE KEVIN COULD

02:25.078 --> 02:26.747
BECOME NEXT WEEK'S TARGET.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.649
>> THEY WANT THE NEXT PERSON TO
GO UP.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.784
THEY DON'T WANT IT THEM.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.188
IF THEY CAN DIVERT THAT
INFORMATION ABOUT ANOTHER HOUSE

02:34.222 --> 02:36.657
GUEST, THAT HOUSE GUEST WENT
AGAINST THEM.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.459
LET'S PUT HIM OR HER UP.

02:38.492 --> 02:41.395
>> BUT CHRISTMAS HAD OTHER
INTENTIONS.

02:41.429 --> 02:45.499
>> WE HAVE TO GET JASON AND ALEX
OUT.

02:45.533 --> 02:51.004
>> AT THE LIVE EVICTION --
>> BY A VOTE OF 6-0, MATT YOU'RE

02:51.038 --> 02:53.474
EVICTED FROM THE BIG BROTHER
HOUSE.

02:53.507 --> 02:57.211
>> THE CEREAL KING HAD TO SAY
CHEERIO TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.079
>> DON'T YELL, OKAY?

02:59.112 --> 03:03.050
>> WITH ONLY SEVEN HOUSE GUESTS
REMAINING, A CRITICAL HEAD OF

03:03.083 --> 03:04.785
HOUSEHOLD IS ON THE LINE.

03:04.818 --> 03:08.088
IT WILL BE UNLIKE ANYTHING
YOU'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.

03:08.121 --> 03:13.193
PLUS, TWO HOUSE GUESTS WILL BE
NOMINATED.

03:13.227 --> 03:20.834
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

04:07.348 --> 04:12.353
>> I KNEW IT!
>> WHAT IS THIS?

04:12.386 --> 04:14.322
>> MATT JUST GOT EVICTED.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.756
SEVEN PEOPLE LEFT IN THE HOUSE.

04:15.789 --> 04:19.627
THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN
HIGHER.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.131
THIS IS CRUCIAL.
>> A TRACK AND FIELD

04:24.164 --> 04:25.499
COMPETITION?

04:25.533 --> 04:26.033
SERIOUSLY.

04:26.066 --> 04:26.900
I HAVE A BROKEN FOOT.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.336
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT.

04:28.369 --> 04:32.906
I'M GOING TO GIVE IT ALL OF MY
ONE GOOD LEG.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.709
>> WE ALL KNEW MATT WAS GETTING
VOTED OUT.

04:35.743 --> 04:39.347
LEADING UP TO THE EVICTION, I
STARTED ORCHESTRATING THIS HOH

04:39.380 --> 04:43.684
COMPETITION TO TAKE A SHOT AT
JASON AND ALEX.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.787
>> OKAY, GANG.

04:46.820 --> 04:53.093
ALEX AND JASON ARE STEAM-ROLLING
EVERY COMPETITION.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.261
THEY'RE BEATING ME.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.363
WE'RE DOWN TO THE WIRE.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.599
IT'S EITHER WE TAKE A SHOT AT
THEM OR WE LOSE.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.968
>> WE HAVE TO TAKE A SHOT AT
THEM.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.235
GET JASON.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.272
>> IF I WIN NEXT WEEK AND I DRAW
THAT LINE, THEY'RE TAKING A SHOT

05:05.305 --> 05:06.206
AT ME.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.208
>> THEY'RE NOT.
>> AND IT'S YOU GUYS ALONE.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.477
>> WE CANNOT WIN.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.713
>> THE PLAY FOR THE WEEKEND IS
TO CONVINCE JASON AND ALEX THAT

05:12.746 --> 05:14.281
KEVIN IS THE TARGET FOR THE
WEEK.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.351
IN REALITY, THEY ARE.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.353
JASON CAN'T COMPETE NEXT WEEK.

05:19.387 --> 05:24.358
BUT IF ALEX FEELS SAFE, SHE
MIGHT NOT CARE ABOUT WINNING THE

05:24.392 --> 05:25.859
HOH COMPETITION.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.061
>> WE NEED TO REALLY SELL THAT
TO THEM.

05:28.095 --> 05:35.168
>> I CAN'T TAKE A SHOT AT JASON
AND ALEX WITHOUT THEM TURNING ON

05:35.202 --> 05:36.136
ME.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.439
I HAVE TO TURN IT OVER TO JOSH
AND CHRISTMAS.

05:38.472 --> 05:41.375
AND THEN ALL THE BLOOD WILL BE
ON THEIR HANDS AND I'LL BE IN

05:41.409 --> 05:44.978
THE SWEET SPOT.
>> IN A PERFECT WORLD, ONE OF

05:45.012 --> 05:50.083
YOU TWO WIN AND YOU TAKE THE
SHOT AND THEN I WIN AND TAKE

05:50.117 --> 05:51.284
ANOTHER SHOT.

05:51.318 --> 05:51.919
THAT'S IT.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.654
>> I WANT TO TAKE THE SHOT.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.157
>> WITH CHRISTMAS AND JOSH ON
BOARD TO TAKE A SHOT AT JASON

05:57.190 --> 06:03.997
AND ALEX, I JUST NEED ALEX ON
BOARD TO THROW THE COMPETITION.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.098
>> WHAT'S THE STRATEGY?

06:05.132 --> 06:08.368
>> ALEX AND I NEED TO COMPETE
NEXT WEEK.

06:08.402 --> 06:14.875
ALL THREE OF US --
>> IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT

06:14.908 --> 06:18.812
CHRISTMAS CAN COMPETE IN, SHOULD
WE GIVE IT TO HER?

06:18.846 --> 06:21.882
WE MIGHT NEED TO DROP OUT.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.918
WHAT WOULD BE THE SMARTER MOVE?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.520
RAVEN OR HIM?

06:26.554 --> 06:31.625
>> BE SMART TO GET KEVIN FIRST.
>> I'M THINKING ABOUT ASKING HIM

06:31.659 --> 06:33.694
TO THROW IT.
>> YEAH.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.930
>> THE PLAN IS TO GET KEVIN OUT
SO SOMEBODY ELSE CAN TAKE CARE

06:36.964 --> 06:39.600
OF GETTING IT 0 OUT AND WE CAN
COMPETE NEXT WEEK.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.469
THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.638
THERE'S NO WAY TO DO IT UNLESS
PAUL CAN GET KEVIN TO THROW IT.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.240
>> HE'S STILL BANKING ON YOU AND
HIM LIKE THIS.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.876
>> MAYBE HE WILL LISTEN TO ME.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.378
IF HE THROWS IT, THEN WE CAN GO
AT HIM.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.915
WE DON'T WANT TO ACCIDENTALLY
WIN.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.852
>> SOUNDS LIKE JASON AND ALEX
ARE BUYING THE IDEA THAT KEVIN

06:58.886 --> 07:02.022
THE TARGET AND ALEX IS OPEN TO
THROWING IT SO.

07:02.055 --> 07:08.328
HAVE TO GET KEVIN TO AGREE TO
THROW IT.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.397
>> SO OFF THE BAT, JUST THROW
IT.

07:10.430 --> 07:10.898
>> DO WHAT?

07:10.931 --> 07:11.398
>> THROW IT.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.132
>> OFF THE BAT?

07:12.165 --> 07:13.066
>> OFF THE BAT.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.538
>> WHAT IF I CAN WIN IT?

07:17.571 --> 07:20.140
>> HAVE I TOLD YOU ANYTHING
WRONG THIS ENTIRE GAME?

07:20.173 --> 07:21.074
>> NO.
>> TRUST ME.

07:21.108 --> 07:28.516
>> WHAT IS ALEX GOING TO THINK
ABOUT THAT?

07:28.549 --> 07:32.786
>> SO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF ME
OR YOU WON IF I THOUGHT I HAD A

07:32.820 --> 07:33.654
GOOD CHANCE.

07:33.687 --> 07:37.825
>> IF YOU STAY ON, NOBODY IS
DROPPING.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.894
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

07:40.928 --> 07:44.331
JUST TRUST ME.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.833
A LITTLE BIT OF FAITH, BUD.

07:45.866 --> 07:50.103
>> SO I'VE GOT ALEX AND JASON
BELIEVING THAT KEVIN IS A TARGET

07:50.137 --> 07:51.304
AND IT'S NOT THEM.

07:51.338 --> 07:55.075
KEVIN SEEMS TO BE ON BOARD TO
THROW THE COMPETITION.

07:55.108 --> 08:06.754
NOW I NEED TO SOLIDIFY ALEX
THROWING TO IT SEAL THE DEAL.

08:06.787 --> 08:10.357
>> YOU GOING TO LET KEVIN WIN?

08:10.390 --> 08:11.725
WE GOING TO LET KEVIN WIN?

08:11.759 --> 08:13.393
>> I TOLD KEVIN TO THROW IT.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.628
>> OKAY.

08:14.662 --> 08:19.199
>> IF KEVIN IS GOING TO THROW
IT, I'M OKAY IN DROPPING IN THIS

08:19.232 --> 08:20.467
COMPETITION.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.372
>> NOW I HAVE TO TELL RAVEN TO
STEP OUT OF THE WAY AND LET JOSH

08:25.405 --> 08:34.682
AND CHRISTMAS TAKE THIS WIN.

08:34.715 --> 08:41.088
>> SHE WANTS TO THROW IT.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.724
I AM POSITIVE.

08:43.757 --> 08:46.226
>> I WANT REVENGE ON JASON.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.730
SO ALEX CANNOT WIN HOH THIS
WEEK.

08:49.763 --> 08:59.807
IF SHE THROWS THIS COMPETITION,
THIS SOUTHERN BELL WILL, TOO.

08:59.807 --> 09:07.748
IF SHE THROWS THIS COMPETITION,
THIS SOUTHERN BELL WILL, TOO.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.251
>> NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS PRETTY
MUCH ON BOARD, I HAVE TO TALK TO

09:11.284 --> 09:14.354
CHRISTMAS, MAKE SURE SHE KNOWS
ALL ABOUT IT AND I CAN STRING UP

09:14.387 --> 09:24.431
MY PUPPETS AND MAKE THEM HAVE A
PUPPET SHOW.

09:24.431 --> 09:30.938
MY PUPPETS AND MAKE THEM HAVE A
PUPPET SHOW.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.505
>> I'M LITERALLY SPEECHLESS.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.941
>> WE'RE THAT GOOD, I GUESS.

09:33.974 --> 09:43.416
>> NOW I HAVE EVERYTHING SET UP,
I HAVE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

09:43.450 --> 09:47.955
>> GOING INTO THIS COMPETITION,
ALEX THINKS THAT KEVIN IS MY

09:47.988 --> 09:49.189
TARGET.

09:49.222 --> 09:51.959
BUT LITTLE DOES SHE KNOW, I'M
TARGETING ALEX AND JASON BECAUSE

09:51.992 --> 09:53.927
THEY'RE A POWER COUPLE.

09:53.961 --> 09:57.497
IN ORDER FOR THIS PLAN TO WORK
OUT, ALEX HAS TO THROW THE

09:57.530 --> 09:58.766
COMPETITION.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.736
I'M HOPING THAT PAUL IS ABLE TO
CONVINCE ALEX AND SHE DOES NOT

10:02.770 --> 10:04.972
GUN FOR IT.

10:05.005 --> 10:13.113
>> THE PLAN IS TO EVICT KEVIN
WITHOUT GOODING BLOOD ON OUR

10:13.146 --> 10:14.381
HANDS.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.349
I WON'T CONSIDER THROWING THIS
COMPETITION UNTIL KEVIN IS OUT

10:16.383 --> 10:17.617
FIRST.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.253
>> NOW THAT MATT IS OUT OF THE
HOUSE, I KNOW WHAT I NEED TO DO.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.690
I NEED TO ALIGN MYSELF WITH
PAUL.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.826
I TRUST HIM 110%.

10:25.859 --> 10:31.298
I HOPE PAUL IS ABLE TO CONVINCE
KELVIN AND ALEX TO DROP.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.900
IF THEY DROP, THIS ONE WILL
DROP.

10:32.933 --> 10:37.137
>> WELCOME TO THE THIRD ANNUAL.

10:37.170 --> 10:42.743
READY, SET, WHOA TRACK MEET!
WITHOUT GOING HOH, I'M NOT

10:42.776 --> 10:44.011
ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE.

10:44.044 --> 10:47.447
OKAY, ATHLETES, THIS COMPETITION
WILL RUN IN FIVE RACES.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.218
EACH RACE, ONE PLAYER WILL BE
ELIMINATED.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.987
AT THE START OF EACH RACE,
YOU'LL GET INTO YOUR STARTING

10:54.021 --> 10:57.357
POSITION AND HOLD DOWN THE TWO
BUTTONS AT THE STARTING LINE

10:57.390 --> 10:59.693
WITH YOUR HANDS.

10:59.727 --> 11:05.766
EACH RACE WILL BEGIN.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.902
WHEN YOU SEE THE WORD GO, YOU
HAVE TO RUN DOWN THE TRACK AND

11:08.936 --> 11:10.971
HIT YOUR FINISH BUTTON.

11:11.004 --> 11:16.443
THE ONE TO HIT THE BUTTON LAST
WILL BE ELIMINATED FROM THIS

11:16.476 --> 11:17.444
COMPETITION.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.846
BE WARNED, THERE'S DECOY WORDS
IN THE MONITOR.

11:18.879 --> 11:22.482
IF YOU RELEASE THE START BUTTONS
BEFORE YOU SEE THE WORD GO, IT'S

11:22.515 --> 11:27.020
A FALSE START AND YOU'LL BE
ELIMINATED AND A NEW RACE WILL

11:27.054 --> 11:28.188
BEGIN.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.489
THE LAST PERSON STANDING WILL BE
THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.793
WHO IS READY TO PLAY?

11:32.826 --> 11:39.132
READY SET, WHOA!
ALL RIGHT.

11:39.166 --> 11:44.571
RUNNERS, TAKE YOUR POSITION.

11:44.604 --> 11:48.175
>> IN THIS COMPETITION, WE GOT
TO GET INTO IT OUR START

11:48.208 --> 11:51.611
POSITION AND HOLD ON TWO
BUTTONS.

11:51.644 --> 11:56.449
WHEN WE SEE THE WORD "GO", WE
HAVE TO RACE AS FAST AS WE CAN

11:56.483 --> 11:59.286
TO HIT THE BUZZER AT THE END OF
THE LINE.

11:59.319 --> 12:03.323
IF YOU LET GO BEFORE YOU SEE GO,
YOU'LL FALSE START AND BE

12:03.356 --> 12:04.491
ELIMINATED.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.726
THE LAST PERSON STANDING WILL BE
THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.663
IF EVERYBODY FOLLOWS THE PLAN
THIS WEEK, THIS HOH WILL BE MINE

12:10.697 --> 12:11.932
OR MY GIRL, CHRISTMAS.

12:11.965 --> 12:22.009
>> GAME IS ON.

12:22.009 --> 12:28.381
>> GAME IS ON.

12:42.729 --> 12:48.768
>> NONE OF THIS PLAN IS GOING TO
WORK IF KEVIN DOESN'T FALL

12:48.802 --> 12:49.970
FIRST.

12:50.003 --> 12:52.305
KEVIN, WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW,
BUDDY, THERE'S A WHOLE WAITING

12:52.339 --> 12:54.541
TO HAPPEN AND IT'S ALL
CONTINGENT ON YOU THROWING IT.

12:54.574 --> 13:03.951
SO THROW IT.

13:14.928 --> 13:18.431
>> OVER THE PAST WEEK, I CRAFTED
A MASTER PLAN TO HAVE EVERYBODY

13:18.465 --> 13:22.602
THROW THIS COMPETITION TO JOSH
OR CHRISTMAS IN ORDER FOR THEM

13:22.635 --> 13:25.672
TO TARGET JASON AND ALEX.

13:25.705 --> 13:28.608
THE WHOLE PLAN PRETTY MUCH
HINGES ON KEVIN TO BE THE FIRST

13:28.641 --> 13:30.810
ONE TO THROW IT.

13:30.844 --> 13:31.778
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.513
MY WHOLE PLAN HINGES ON KEVIN?

13:33.546 --> 13:44.691
I MIGHT HAVE JUST PLAYED MYSELF.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.327
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> LOOK LIKE WE HAVE A FALSE

13:47.360 --> 13:48.295
START.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.563
KEVIN, YOU CAN TAKE YOUR SEAT ON
THE BLEACHERS.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.732
>> EVERYBODY STAND UP AND
STRETCH OUT BEFORE ROUND TWO.

13:52.765 --> 13:57.270
>> NOW THAT KEVIN IS DOWN, I'M
HOPING THAT ALEX FALLS THROUGH

13:57.304 --> 13:59.706
WITH THE DOMINO EFFECT.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.508
SHE GOES NEXT.

14:01.541 --> 14:05.478
IF SHE DOESN'T, THEN ALL MY HARD
WORK GOES TO WASTE.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.679
>> KEVIN FALSE STARTS.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.282
I'M THINKING HOLY CRAP, IT'S
GOING TO WORK.

14:09.316 --> 14:15.622
I'M NOT 100% SOLD YET BECAUSE
ALEX IS STILL IN THE GAME.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.157
>> I COULD HAVE WON THIS.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.494
>> ARE THE BUTTONS THAT SINCIVE,
KEVIN?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.796
>> APPARENTLY.

14:23.830 --> 14:27.901
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT KEVIN
WAS DUMB ENOUGH TO THROW THIS

14:27.935 --> 14:29.302
COMPETITION BECAUSE PAUL ASKED
HIM TO.

14:29.336 --> 14:34.007
HE LITERALLY IS GOING TO GET
HIMSELF OUT OF GAME THIS WEEK

14:34.041 --> 14:35.542
BECAUSE HE TRUSTED PAUL.

14:35.575 --> 14:40.013
>> RUNNERS, TAKE YOUR POSITIONS.

14:40.047 --> 14:50.090
>> THE RACE IS ON.

14:50.090 --> 14:56.896
>> THE RACE IS ON.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.399
>> OOPS.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.902
MY BAD.
>> LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A FALSE

15:02.936 --> 15:05.338
START IN LANE THREE.

15:05.372 --> 15:10.410
>> WHAT THE -- THESE MEATBALLS
BOUGHT INTO IT.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.711
THEY PLAYED THEMSELVES.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.347
>> ALEX, TAKE A SEAT ON THE
BENCH.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.650
>> EVERYBODY CAN STAND UP AND
STRETCH OUT BEFORE ROUND THREE.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.519
>> ALEX IS OUT.

15:19.552 --> 15:23.290
THE PLAN SEEMS TO BE WORKING,
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

15:23.323 --> 15:29.196
NOW I NEED RAVEN TO DROP SO JOSH
AND CHRISTMAS CAN WIN AND BREAK

15:29.229 --> 15:31.231
UP THIS POWER DUO.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.566
>> I NEED A WATER BREAK.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.770
>> IT'S DOWN TO RAVEN, PAUL,
CHRISTMAS AND JOSH.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.939
>> PAUL, LET'S GO.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.074
COME ON, CHRISTMAS.

15:41.108 --> 15:45.145
>> YOU'RE DOING IT FOR TREJO?

15:45.178 --> 15:46.879
>> PETTY AS A PENGUIN.

15:46.913 --> 15:51.084
>> NOW THAT ALEX AND KEVIN ARE
OUT, I FEEL GREAT.

15:51.118 --> 15:55.222
PAUL HAS A PLAN THIS WEEK AND I
TRUST HIM.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.924
SO THIS GIRL IS THROWING THE
COMPETITION.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.295
>> RUNNERS, GET IN YOUR READY
POSITION.

16:02.329 --> 16:12.339
GAME IS ON.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.841
>> LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A FALSE
START.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.243
LANE SIX.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.278
RAVEN, TAKE A SEAT ON THE
BLEACHERS.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.480
>> EVERYONE IS JUMPING OUT.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.682
EVERYONE IS FALLING OUT.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.951
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.553
IT'S A REALLY WEIRD SITUATION.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.522
>> THIS IS GOING BETTER THAN
EXPECTED.

16:29.556 --> 16:35.862
KEVIN, ALEX AND RAVEN ARE
ALREADY OUT.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.365
IT'S DOWN TO ME, PAUL AND JOSH.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.734
HOW THIS SHAKES OUT, MY TEAM IS
IN A GREAT SPOT THIS WEEK.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.537
>> IT'S DOWN TO PAUL, JOSH AND
CHRISTMAS.

16:44.571 --> 16:48.875
>> NOW THAT MY PUPPETS HAVE
DANCED THEIR WAY OUT OF THE

16:48.908 --> 16:53.846
COMPETITION, IT'S TIME FOR THE
PUP MET MASTER TO BOW OUT.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.048
I'M OUT OF HERE.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.251
>> IN YOUR START POSITIONS.

16:58.285 --> 17:06.093
THE RACE IS ON.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.227
FALSE START, LANE FOUR.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.163
PAUL HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.264
>> PAUL GETS OUT.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.399
I'M DISAPPOINTED.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.201
I THOUGHT HE COULD WIN IT.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.035
I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S
DOING.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.071
HE HAS AN IDEA AND A PLAN.

17:18.105 --> 17:23.009
I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERYONE HAS
ONE, SO WE'LL WAIT TO SEE WHAT

17:23.042 --> 17:23.410
HAPPENS.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.111
>> ALL RIGHT.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.346
IT'S DOWN TO CHRISTMAS AND JOSH.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.515
WHO WILL BECOME THE NEXT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.583
>> IT'S DOWN TO ME AND
CHRISTMAS.

17:30.617 --> 17:35.788
EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO WIN,
STRATEGICALLY IT'S MORE FOR LET

17:35.822 --> 17:39.459
TO LET MY GIRL WIN THIS WEEK,
THIS IS A COMPETITION SHE CAN

17:39.492 --> 17:43.196
COMPETE MANY AND GIVE ME AN
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE NEXT WEEK

17:43.230 --> 17:45.031
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.099
>> YOU TAKE IT.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.369
>> IT WON'T BE REALISTIC IF I
BEAT YOU.

17:49.402 --> 17:56.176
>> IF I'M HOPPING AND YOU
WALKING -- I JUST WANT IT TO BE

17:56.209 --> 17:56.976
REALISTIC.

17:57.009 --> 18:04.884
>>
>> ALL OF THESE FALSE STARTS ARE

18:04.917 --> 18:05.985
LOOKING SO OBVIOUS.

18:06.018 --> 18:15.094
PAUL, YOU GOT OUT ON A PAIR OF
GRASPS, BUDDY.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.197
I TRY TO TELL JOSH TO FALL
FORWARD.

18:17.230 --> 18:18.398
TRIP ON HIS FACE.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.399
I DON'T KNOW.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.134
SOMETHING.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.970
RUNNERS TAKE YOUR POSITION.

18:24.003 --> 18:33.746
THE RACE IS ON.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.149
>> WHAT THE HELL?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.917
WHAT?

18:37.950 --> 18:41.888
RUN, RUN, RUN!
>> JOSH, YOU'RE ELIMINATED.

18:41.921 --> 18:52.732
CHRISTMAS IS THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD!

18:52.765 --> 18:57.970
>> EVEN THOUGH JOSH MADE THAT
REALLY OBVIOUS, I'M HOH AND WE

18:58.004 --> 19:00.607
HAVE THE POWER THIS WEEK.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.509
EVERYTHING IS GOING ACCORDING TO
PLAN.

19:02.542 --> 19:08.848
AND I CAN TAKE A SHOT AT THE
LAST KNOWN POWER COUPLE.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.852
>> I LITERALLY CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT I PULLED THAT OFF.

19:12.885 --> 19:17.390
I PRETTY MUCH GOT THE 1-LEGGED
GIRL TO WIN A FOOT RACE.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.827
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO MAKE A
JOKE.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.362
THAT'S HILARIOUS.

19:22.395 --> 19:27.033
SO NOW CHRISTMAS CAN PUT UP
JASON AND ALEX AND I GET TO SIT

19:27.066 --> 19:30.237
BACK AND RELAX ANOTHER WEEK
AVOIDING THE BLOCK.

19:30.270 --> 19:36.042
>> YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LOSERS
EXCEPT FOR CHRISTMAS.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.945
>> GOOD JOB, CHRISTMAS.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.581
GIVE ME A HUG, GIRL.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.884
>> CHRISTMAS WINS AND IT'S LIKE
THE BEST DAY EVER.

19:44.917 --> 19:45.585
I LOVE CHRISTMAS.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.153
I TRUST HER.

19:47.186 --> 19:52.058
I KNOW SHE'S A TRUE HOMEY AND DO
WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND THAT'S

19:52.091 --> 19:55.928
GET KEVIN OUT THIS WEEK.

20:04.103 --> 20:10.377
>> OH, BOY.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.647
>> GOOD JOB, CHRISTMAS.

20:14.681 --> 20:19.686
>> HOH IN THE HOUSE, BABY.

20:19.719 --> 20:23.256
THIS HOH TASTES SWEET AND I'M
GOING TO HAVE FUN WITH IT THIS

20:23.290 --> 20:24.291
WEEK.

20:24.324 --> 20:27.159
JASON IS MY NUMBER 1 TARGET BUT
ALEX IS MY BACKUP.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.228
WE HAVE TO SPLIT THIS SUPER
COUPLE.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.030
TIM LUCKY ONE THAT GETS TO TAKE
THE SHOT.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.400
>> LAST SEASON I WAS ON THE
BLOCK ABOUT SEVEN TIMES.

20:33.433 --> 20:37.169
SO I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO
STRATEGIZE FOR AN END GAME.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.139
THIS SEASON, I HAVEN'T BEEN ON
THE BLOCK ONCE YET.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.475
SO I'M FORCED TO PLAY A
DIFFERENT GAME.

20:42.509 --> 20:47.514
I JUST GOT THE ENTIRE HOUSE TO
THROW A COMPETITION WITHOUT EVEN

20:47.547 --> 20:48.481
PLAYING ONE ROUND.

20:48.515 --> 21:02.128
THIS MIGHT BE MY GREATEST FEAT
OF ALL TIME.

21:02.161 --> 21:06.466
>> EVEN THOUGH MATT IS OUT OF
THE HOUSE, CHRISTMAS IS HOH AND

21:06.499 --> 21:07.934
I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED ABOUT
THIS.

21:07.967 --> 21:12.839
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT JALEX
THIS WEEK, BLINDSIDE.

21:12.872 --> 21:13.673
OH, WAIT.

21:13.706 --> 21:19.779
IS THAT WHAT YOU DID TO MATT AND
I?

21:19.812 --> 21:31.057
KARMA BECOME AS REALITY AND
BITES YOU IN THE --

21:31.090 --> 21:34.293
>> I DON'T NEED ALEX TO GET
SUSPICIOUS AND FREAKING OUT.

21:34.327 --> 21:39.031
SO I'M GOING TO CELEBRATE WITH
HER AS IF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

21:39.065 --> 21:44.471
PLANNING IS WORKING.

21:44.504 --> 21:45.605
>> HOLA.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.406
>> HOLA.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.941
>> WHY IS SHE CELEBRATING?

21:48.975 --> 21:49.709
>> COME HERE.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.578
>> OH, GREAT.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.882
NOW I GOT TO WORRY ABOUT KEVIN
PAIR NOD.

21:55.915 --> 22:00.387
SO I HAVE TO DO SOME DAMAGE
BEFORE HE SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL

22:00.420 --> 22:10.530
AND GOES NUTS.

22:10.530 --> 22:16.035
AND GOES NUTS.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.871
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PLAN
IS, BUT I TRUST PAUL.

22:18.905 --> 22:26.345
I'M HOPING HE'S GOT MY BACK AND
THINGS WILL GOING TO WORK OUT.

22:26.379 --> 22:30.617
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.352
>> I WANT KEVIN TO KEEP HIS
MOUTH CLOSED BECAUSE HE CLEARLY

22:33.386 --> 22:34.921
HAS A HARD TIME DOING THAT.

22:34.954 --> 22:39.426
SO THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS TELL KEVIN MY PLAN SO HE CAN

22:39.459 --> 22:42.562
RUN HIS TRAP TO HIS BOYFRIEND
JASON AND BLOW UP EVERYTHING.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.865
>> AM I BEING NOMINATED?

22:45.898 --> 22:55.942
>> NO.

22:55.942 --> 23:01.313
>> NO.

23:01.347 --> 23:07.754
>> NOW THAT MATTHEW IS GONE,
PAUL IS MY FINAL GUY.

23:07.787 --> 23:08.655
WE'RE TWO SMART PEOPLE.

23:08.688 --> 23:14.861
WE KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME.

23:14.894 --> 23:23.402
>> PAUL IS MY BUDDY BUDDY.

23:23.436 --> 23:28.641
>> WHY IS IT AS SOON AS YOU
BECOME HOH, YOU FEEL --

23:28.675 --> 23:31.878
>> CHRISTMAS!
CHRISTMAS.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.112
>> NOPE.

23:33.145 --> 23:39.051
NOT SURE.

23:39.085 --> 23:42.655
>> OKAY!
DONE.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.623
YOU'RE WELCOME.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.225
I'LL PUSH YOU UP.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.627
RIGHT NEXT TO JASON.

23:47.660 --> 23:52.331
>>
>> KEVIN IS A TARGET THIS WEEK.

23:52.364 --> 23:56.002
I WANT TO BE A PAWN TO MAKE SURE
THAT HE GOES HOME.

23:56.035 --> 24:10.883
NOBODY WILL VOTE AGAINST ME WITH
KEVIN ON THE BLOCK BESIDE ME.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.251
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.452
NO ONE TELLS ME NOTHING AT ALL.

24:13.486 --> 24:16.022
>> EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE TO SAY SOMETHING.

24:16.055 --> 24:16.589
>> ALL RIGHT.

24:16.623 --> 24:20.793
I HONESTLY HAVE NO IDEA.

24:20.827 --> 24:23.663
>> WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD?

24:23.696 --> 24:28.400
>> WHAT I WOULD GUESS IS
HAPPENING IS YOU AND RAVEN GO

24:28.434 --> 24:28.935
UP.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.469
>> ME AND RAVEN?

24:30.503 --> 24:32.304
>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD GUESS.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.140
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.908
>> THEY NEVER TALK TO ABOUT
NOTHING?

24:35.942 --> 24:36.743
>> NOT YET.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.011
>> KEVIN IS MY BUDDY, MY PAL.

24:39.045 --> 24:42.248
I'M TRYING TO BRACE HIM FOR THE
IMPACT.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.519
I'M ALMOST 100% CERTAIN HE WILL
SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE

24:46.553 --> 24:47.887
NOMINATION WALL.

24:47.920 --> 24:48.788
SORRY, KEVIN.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.857
THE PLAN IS FOR YOU TO GO HOME
THIS WEEK?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.391
>> WHO IS GOING HOME?

24:52.424 --> 24:54.861
RAVEN OR ME?

24:54.894 --> 24:55.795
>> ME?

24:55.828 --> 24:59.632
>> YOU AND PAUL AREN'T GOING TO
VOTE ME OUT.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.466
>> YEAH.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.502
>> SO JASON IS TELLING ME TIM
TARGET.

25:03.536 --> 25:07.574
PAUL IS TELLING ME I'M NOT GOING
ON THE BLOCK.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.175
I'M TRUSTING WHAT PAUL SAYS.

25:09.208 --> 25:10.209
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.011
>> GOING TO MAKE THINGS STICKY,
HUH?

25:12.044 --> 25:12.979
>> OH, YEAH.

25:13.012 --> 25:17.016
>> IT'S THE NATURE OF THE GAME
THOUGH, RIGHT?

25:17.049 --> 25:30.897
>> YEAH.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.734
>> WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

25:34.767 --> 25:45.678
>> THIS KNEE NEEDS SURGERY SO --
>> IT'S A KNEECAP SYNDROME.

25:45.712 --> 25:52.318
MY BONE IS DETERIORATING.

25:52.351 --> 25:54.921
>> HOW DID YOU GET NO CARTILAGE?

25:54.954 --> 25:58.958
>> I THOUGHT I HEARD IT ALL
BEFORE.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.428
MENSA, OLYMPIC ATHLETE.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.563
INVERSION OF THE SPINE.

26:04.597 --> 26:08.200
NOW WE HAVE ROUGH KNEECAP
SYNDROME.

26:08.234 --> 26:14.741
>> ROUGH KNEECAPS SPEND A
WEEKEND IN THE RODEO ARENA.

26:14.774 --> 26:21.447
IF ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE ROUGH
KNEECAPS, IT SHOULD BE ME.

26:21.480 --> 26:31.523
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

26:31.523 --> 26:38.164
I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.671
>> DON'T GET PARANOID.

26:44.704 --> 26:48.040
>> I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE
STRATEGY FOR TOMORROW.

26:48.074 --> 26:50.076
>> WE CAN BLINDSIDE OR GO
FORWARD.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.044
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR
GAME.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.279
>> I KNOW.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.082
>> YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYBODY
ELSE'S GAME AND YOU CAN'T LET

26:56.115 --> 26:58.818
ANYBODY INFLUENCE YOUR GAME.

26:58.851 --> 27:02.188
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR GAME.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.124
>> OH, MY GOD.

27:05.157 --> 27:09.561
I DON'T NEED NO HELP.

27:09.595 --> 27:19.638
>>
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

27:19.638 --> 27:25.812
>>
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

27:39.458 --> 27:40.793
ABOUT THIS.

27:40.827 --> 27:44.864
THE BEST STRATEGY IS TO PUT BOTH
JASON AND ALEX ON THE BLOCK.

27:44.897 --> 27:48.801
I'M GUARANTEED THAT ONE OF THEM
IS GOING HOME.

27:48.835 --> 27:59.011
I HOPE THIS TREE OF TEMPTATION
DOES NOT CREW THE PLAN UP.

27:59.045 --> 28:02.715
>> THIS IS CRAZY.

28:12.759 --> 28:17.797
>> I'M TELLING YOU -- ELENA
REMINDS ME OF THREE GIRLS THAT I

28:17.830 --> 28:18.898
DATED.

28:18.931 --> 28:24.203
AS SOON AS I WALKED IN AND I SAW
ELENA, I WAS LIKE --

28:37.950 --> 28:44.924
>> I WANT TO TELL JASON A SECRET
BY THE THING WHEN HE GETS OUT OF

28:44.957 --> 28:48.527
THE BATHROOM.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.565
>> WHAT'S UP?

29:03.609 --> 29:09.181
>> SHE'S TELLING ME ALL STUPID
.

29:09.215 --> 29:19.258
>> DAMMIT!
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:19.258 --> 29:25.597
>> DAMMIT!
>> OH, MY GOD!

29:30.736 --> 29:31.003
REALLY?

29:31.037 --> 29:33.139
I CAN'T.

29:33.172 --> 29:37.009
>> YOU GOT AIR TIME AND DISTANCE
WITH THAT.

29:37.043 --> 29:39.645
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GOT IN
THERE.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.414
>> THAT'S MY BEST YET.

29:42.448 --> 29:55.862
THE BEST YET.

29:55.895 --> 30:00.466
>> THE TREE OF TEMPTATION HAS
SPRUNG TO LIFE FOR THE FINAL

30:00.499 --> 30:06.638
TIME.

30:06.672 --> 30:11.610
>> THERE'S FOUR APPLES ON THE
TREE OF TEMPTATIONS.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.881
TWO PUNISHMENT OR TWO POWERS.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.117
THE TWO PUNISHMENTS ARE BOUNTY
ON YOUR HEAD AND CAN'T PLAY THE

30:18.150 --> 30:19.485
NEXT HOH.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.554
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO GO FOR
THE APPLES THIS WEEK.

30:22.588 --> 30:23.389
EVEN MY TEAM.

30:23.422 --> 30:28.127
IT COULD RUIN THE PLAN I HAVE IN
PLACE.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.430
>> ARE YOU GOING FOR THE TREE?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.099
>> NO.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.667
>> JUSTIN, GRAB AN APPLE.

30:35.701 --> 30:41.507
>> THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SCREW
UP THE PLAN IF SOMEBODY WERE TO

30:41.540 --> 30:45.144
GET THE SECOND VETO AND JASON
AND ALEX WIN BOTH OF THEM AND

30:45.177 --> 30:46.678
PULL THEMSELVES OFF.

30:46.712 --> 30:50.682
THEN TWO PEOPLE HAVE TO GO UP,
MAYBE ME, MAYBE SOMEBODY FROM MY

30:50.716 --> 30:53.719
TEAM AND THE PLAN FALLS THROUGH.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.755
>> I'M JUST MAKING SURE YOU'RE
OKAY.

30:56.788 --> 30:59.025
>> I'M CALM.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.326
GIVE ME A BREAK.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.029
>> SOME OF THOSE APPLES COULD BE
TEMPTING.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.165
THEY CAN BE GOOD, GET YOU IN
TROUBLE.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.433
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO ADAM AND
EVE.

31:07.466 --> 31:08.567
>> I'M FINE.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.668
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.038
>> PAUL GAVE ME HIS WORD.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.739
HE SAID PLAY IT COOL.

31:13.772 --> 31:15.207
DON'T AGGRAVATE NOBODY.

31:15.241 --> 31:18.344
I'M GOING TO STAY AWAY FROM THE
TREE.

31:18.377 --> 31:28.420
>> THANKS, PAL.

31:28.420 --> 31:36.162
>> THANKS, PAL.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.868
>> EVERYONE IS SO SCARED OF THIS
TREE.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.904
BUT NOT ME.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.872
I'M A RISK TAKER.

32:20.906 --> 32:25.811
I KIND OF WANT TO TRY ONE OF
THESE BAD BOYS OUT.

32:25.844 --> 32:29.481
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO TAKE ONE OF
THOSE APPLES, SHAKE EVERYBODY UP

32:29.515 --> 32:33.052
A LITTLE BIT AND SEE WHAT I GET.

32:33.085 --> 32:36.022
>> JASON, DON'T YOU DARE GO FOR
ONE OF THOSE APPLES.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.524
>> JASON, GET AWAY FROM THAT
TREE.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.126
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING AN
APPLE.

32:40.159 --> 32:41.727
>> GOING FOR THE APPLE.

32:41.760 --> 32:49.268
>> NO ONE IS COMING AFTER US IF
YOU DO SOMETHING STUPID, YOU CAN

32:49.301 --> 32:57.243
MAKE US BOTH A TARGET.

33:08.220 --> 33:11.423
>> JASON, DON'T YOU DARE GO FOR
ONE OF THOSE APPLES.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.526
>> GOING FOR THE APPLE.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.065
>> I'M JUST KIDDING.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.234
DO I LOOK LIKE I NEED A BIG
TARGET ON MY BACK?

33:22.268 --> 33:26.972
I MIGHT BE A CLOWN BUT I'M NOT
STUPID.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.641
>> HE COMES OUT AND I WAS IN A
PANIC.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.842
OH, JASON.

33:30.876 --> 33:34.380
YOU SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE
TREE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO

33:34.413 --> 33:45.557
WISH YOU HAD AFTER NOMINATION.

33:45.591 --> 33:53.232
>> WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

33:53.265 --> 33:59.571
>> THE TREE OF TEMPTATION HAS
COME TO AN END.

33:59.605 --> 34:04.343
AND CAN NO LONGER HELP YOU IN
THE GAME.

34:04.376 --> 34:13.285
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES?

34:13.319 --> 34:23.362
>> THAT'S THE THIRD TIME.

34:23.362 --> 34:30.469
>> THAT'S THE THIRD TIME.

34:55.093 --> 35:08.607
>> YOU'RE DOING TO KILL ME ONE
DAY.

35:08.640 --> 35:14.546
>> IT INCREASES THE ENGAGEMENT
IN THE LOWER ABDOMINAL.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.248
>> IT WILL LIGHT YOU UP.

35:16.282 --> 35:23.489
>> I'M A LACROSSE CHAMPION AND
WEIGHT LIFTER AND I LOVE

35:23.522 --> 35:27.125
PHYSICAL FITNESS.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.460
>> HELLO, BODY.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.362
I'VE ABUSED YOU A LOT.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.863
NOT BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

35:31.897 --> 35:39.238
>> AFTER MY SURGERY, I WASN'T
ABLE TO WORK OUT AT ALL.

35:39.271 --> 35:43.809
AS TIME WENT BY, I IMPLEMENTED A
LITTLE BIT MORE EACH TIME.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.612
>> CHRISTMAS IS AMAZING.

35:46.645 --> 35:52.618
SHE HAS A BROKEN FOOT AND A BOOT
ON AND SHE'S HITTING CRUNCHES.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.754
SHE'S THE BIGGEST BAD ASS THAT
I'VE EVER MET.

35:55.787 --> 35:59.090
>> I HAVE TO GET CREATIVE WITH
MY WORKOUTS.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.726
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME.

36:00.759 --> 36:05.831
EVEN WITH MY BROKEN FOOT, I'M
GIVING IT MY ALL.

36:22.514 --> 36:26.685
>> HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING CRAZY
THERE?

36:26.718 --> 36:32.524
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO?

36:32.558 --> 36:35.261
>> YOU DO WANT TO KEEP HIM OUT
OF THE QUESTION?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.162
>> KEVIN IS TARGET.

36:37.195 --> 36:41.667
WE DON'T WANT TO GET HIM FREAKED
OUT.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.035
HE GETS PARANOID WHEN HE'S ON
BLOCK.

36:44.069 --> 36:48.874
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO
PUT UP TWO PAWNS SO HE DOESN'T

36:48.907 --> 36:50.242
SEE THE BACK DOOR COMING.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.444
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE VOTES.

36:52.478 --> 36:55.247
>> I DON'T THINK ANY ONE WILL
FLIP ON IT.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.648
>> NO.

36:56.682 --> 36:58.984
>> THIS IS PSYCHOLOGICAL
WARFARE.

36:59.017 --> 37:00.519
>> AND WE'RE WINNING.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.454
>> I'M WINNING.

37:02.488 --> 37:13.465
YOU'RE LIKE YEAH, YEAH!
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOING?

37:13.499 --> 37:20.872
>> GOING AFTER ME AND KEVIN.

37:30.482 --> 37:37.255
>> I THINK JOSH WOULD BE A GREAT
PAWN AGAINST HIM.

37:37.289 --> 37:41.327
THERE'S NO COMPLICATIONS NO,
DRAMA AND WE CAN BACK DOOR KEVIN

37:41.360 --> 37:42.428
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.

37:42.461 --> 37:44.563
>> OKAY.

37:44.596 --> 37:49.067
I'LL TALK TO HER.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.269
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

37:51.303 --> 37:56.375
YOU WANT TO PUT UP TWO PAWNS AND
HIM OR HOW FAR YOU WANT TO GO

37:56.408 --> 37:57.809
WITH THAT?

37:57.843 --> 37:58.510
>> I DON'T KNOW.

37:58.544 --> 38:01.179
I WANT TO COME UP WITH A MODEL.

38:01.212 --> 38:06.051
>> THE PLAN IS TO PUT UP JASON
AND ALEX NO MATTER WHAT.

38:06.084 --> 38:11.390
NOW THAT ALEX HAS SUGGESTED TWO
PAWNS GO UP, DO I MAKE IT THINK

38:11.423 --> 38:16.762
LIKE THEIR PAWNS AND THE PLAN IS
TO BACK DOOR KEVIN OR JASON IS

38:16.795 --> 38:19.297
MY TARGET AND DRAW A LINE IN THE
SAND.

38:19.331 --> 38:24.470
DO I WANT TO PLAY THE HONEST
GAME OR GO TO THE SNEAKY SNAKE

38:24.503 --> 38:29.274
GAME.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.075
>> OKAY.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.411
HONK TERM, WHAT IS THE BEST
OPTION?

38:32.444 --> 38:37.383
>> IF YOU MAKE JASON THE CLEAR
TARGET AND SAY ALEX, THIS IS

38:37.416 --> 38:45.757
NOTHING AGAINST YOU, BUT IF YOU
WIN -- THEN IT COMES TO ALEX AND

38:45.791 --> 38:46.392
JASON.

38:46.425 --> 38:47.893
IT'S ABOUT TAKING THE HEAT.

38:47.926 --> 38:50.662
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE HEAT.

38:50.696 --> 39:01.272
>> WE CAN ALSO GO THE ROUTE OF
KEEPING IT AMBIGUOUS LIKE WE'RE

39:01.306 --> 39:03.274
GOING TO BACK DOOR KEVIN AND NOT
DO THAT.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.777
>> I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS IS
THE RIGHT MOVE.

39:05.811 --> 39:10.315
OR I CANNOT ONLY SINK MY GAME
AND MY TEAMMATES.

39:10.348 --> 39:10.816
>> GOOD LUCK.

39:10.849 --> 39:15.887
>> CHEERS.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.098
>> HEY, EVERYBODY.

39:27.132 --> 39:32.137
IT'S TIME FOR THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.288
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:50.321 --> 39:53.759
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

39:53.792 --> 39:56.428
TWO HOUSE GUESTS FOR EVICTION.

39:56.462 --> 39:59.565
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSE GUESTS THAT

39:59.598 --> 40:03.101
I'M NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

40:03.134 --> 40:07.305
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS AND THEIR FACES

40:07.338 --> 40:13.378
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

40:13.411 --> 40:24.222
THE FIRST GUEST I HAVE NOMINATED
IS -- THE NEXT HOUSE GUEST I

40:24.255 --> 40:28.126
HAVE NOMINATED IS --

40:46.545 --> 40:49.515
>> I CAN'T TELL IF YOU'RE
KIDDING.

40:49.548 --> 40:59.424
>> I'M NOT GOING TO GET UP AND
LOOK AT HIM.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.960
>> I'M HERE.

41:01.993 --> 41:07.198
>> I NOMINATED YOU, ALEX AND
YOU, JASON.

41:07.232 --> 41:12.938
ALEX I NOMINATED YOU BECAUSE
YOU'RE A PAWN IN THIS POSITION.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.674
JASON --
>> I HOPE THERE'S TWO PAWNS.

41:15.707 --> 41:21.146
>> JASON, I NOMINATED YOU
BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE

41:21.179 --> 41:21.713
COMPETITOR.

41:21.747 --> 41:22.914
YOU'RE A TRIPLE THREAT.

41:22.948 --> 41:28.386
WITH THAT, I NEED TO BE ABLE TO
IN THIS POSITION TAKE OUT A

41:28.419 --> 41:31.089
STRONG MALE FIGURE.

41:31.122 --> 41:35.126
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.600
>> I'M ON THE BLOCK WITH JASON.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.536
I'M STARTING TO PANIC.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.939
CHRISTMAS, WHEN I SAID TWO
PAWNS, I DIDN'T MEAN ME AND

41:47.973 --> 41:49.007
JASON.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.276
AT THE SAME TIME I TRUST
CHRISTMAS AND I TRUST HER

41:51.309 --> 41:52.410
JUDGMENT IN THIS DECISION.

41:52.443 --> 41:54.713
SHE MUST HAVE A PLAN TO BACK
DOOR KEVIN.

41:54.746 --> 41:58.850
>> WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ALEX AND
I UP?

41:58.884 --> 42:05.691
ONE THING IF I WAS UP THERE AND
JOSH OR ALEX AND RAVEN?

42:05.724 --> 42:08.259
THE PLAN IS TO GET KEVIN, NOT
ME.

42:08.293 --> 42:11.997
SO I'M THINKING THERE'S
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE TO IT

42:12.030 --> 42:14.399
THAN THAT GOING ON.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.368
GOOD LUCK PRYING THAT VETO OUT
OF MY HANDS THIS TIME.

42:17.402 --> 42:19.771
>> JASON IS MY NUMBER 1 TARGET.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.306
ALEX IS MY NUMBER 2.

42:21.339 --> 42:25.376
BUT IN ORDER FOR ME TO GET OUT
MY MAIN TARGET, JASON, I HAVE TO

42:25.410 --> 42:27.879
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T WIN THE
VETO.

42:27.913 --> 42:31.482
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU OUT TO
PASTURE SO YOU CAN SPEND YOUR

42:31.516 --> 42:36.187
FINAL DAYS IN THE JURY HOUSE.

42:36.221 --> 42:39.190
YEAH!
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WORKED!

42:39.224 --> 42:42.093
AND MY HANDS ARE SQUEAKY CLEAN.

42:42.127 --> 42:45.196
>> WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF
VETO?

42:45.230 --> 42:49.200
WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE JASON OR
ALEX FROM EVICTION?

42:49.234 --> 42:54.773
FIND OUT WEDNESDAY AT 8/7
