WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:05.473
- You good?

00:05.539 --> 00:06.974
- Just getting
my 10,000 steps in.

00:07.041 --> 00:10.010
- Pete, relax.
It's gonna go our way.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.945
You said yourself,
this case is a lock.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.315
- That was before they started
day two of deliberations.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.949
You both know,
the longer the jury's out,

00:16.016 --> 00:17.185
the less likely it is that--

00:17.251 --> 00:18.252
[phone ringing]

00:18.319 --> 00:20.488
- We have a verdict?

00:20.554 --> 00:23.624
[tense music]

00:23.691 --> 00:26.694
- I had that jury eating
out of the palm of my hand.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.829
- Cheers.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.465
* *

00:31.532 --> 00:34.502
- But listen,
this was a team effort,

00:34.568 --> 00:37.371
which is why
my illustrious second chair

00:37.438 --> 00:38.839
gets the first break.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.574
- Aw, so I can kick
your ass again?

00:40.641 --> 00:43.511
- Please.
You got lucky last time.

00:43.577 --> 00:47.148
- Y'all really are lawyers
through and through.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.084
Gluttons for punishment.

00:50.151 --> 00:51.619
* *

00:51.685 --> 00:55.223
- [laughing]
- Come on.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.824
Johnnie, slow down.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.891
- Walk faster.

00:57.958 --> 01:00.128
- This is fast
as I go in heels.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.463
Hi.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.399
- Uncomfortable workplace.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.067
- We're not at work, Johnnie.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.537
- Very true.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.508
- Hey, Kat.

01:14.575 --> 01:19.547
* *

01:19.613 --> 01:21.515
[rapid gunfire]

01:21.582 --> 01:23.584
[tires squealing]

01:23.651 --> 01:26.787
[dramatic music]

01:26.854 --> 01:33.794
* *

01:35.028 --> 01:37.030
- Your way is
definitely not faster.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.666
- No, wait, look.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.634
The subway steps are
on this side of the street,

01:40.701 --> 01:41.635
so now you don't have
to wait for the light.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.237
- Okay.
- I have rights!

01:43.304 --> 01:45.105
I will get a lawyer!
- Great.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.240
Maybe she knows mine.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.675
- What the hell is this?

01:47.741 --> 01:50.077
- Just some regular
Tuesday drama in New York.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.312
Dude, don't get involved.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.080
- Me and my son.
I don't have the money!

01:53.147 --> 01:54.682
- Get me the money,
and everything will be fine.

01:54.748 --> 01:55.749
- Hey, hey!
- I don't have it!

01:55.816 --> 01:57.418
Is this guy bothering you?

01:57.485 --> 01:58.952
- This guy is her landlord,
all right?

01:59.019 --> 02:02.690
- He is a slumlord,
raising our rent by $2,000.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.326
My son and I have been model
tenants for four years,

02:05.393 --> 02:06.427
and out of nowhere--

02:06.494 --> 02:07.595
- Can you pay the money or not?

02:07.661 --> 02:08.862
- I told you, I don't have it!

02:08.929 --> 02:10.298
- OK, so I show
the apartment then.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.065
- To Barbie and Ken?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.401
Like hell you are.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.702
I still got five days
left on my lease.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.438
- I don't care--
- Hey, hey, hey.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.972
Let's just all take
a deep breath right now.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.608
- Stay out of this,
all right, buddy?

02:20.674 --> 02:21.642
Or I'll call the cops.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.278
- Call the damn cops.

02:24.345 --> 02:25.713
- Ray!

02:25.779 --> 02:27.381
It's Remy.
We got to go.

02:27.448 --> 02:31.419
[soft music]

02:31.485 --> 02:33.153
- I'm sorry.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.922
- Thank you.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.226
- Give me the money or go.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.462
- How many times do I have
to tell you, I don't have it.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.465
- Then get your kid
and get out!

02:45.399 --> 02:46.700
- Don't get too comfortable.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
Jet's gassing up as we speak.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.603
- Ooh, Saint-Tropez?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.971
- Forrest City, Arkansas.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.373
An entire district
attorney's office

02:52.440 --> 02:53.741
was assassinated last night.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.209
- That's a big crime
for a tiny town.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.877
What happened,
overwhelmed sheriff's office

02:56.944 --> 02:58.746
call in overwhelmed
Little Rock SSA?

02:58.812 --> 03:00.147
- Who called Isabel,
who called me.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.115
PD sent these over.
They need help.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.251
- Well, I can see why.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.652
Were these taken
on a flip phone?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.420
- Shooting happened
outside a bar.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.855
Owner says he heard gunfire

03:07.921 --> 03:09.890
just after 3:00 a.m.,
around closing.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.659
- Any witnesses?
- You're looking at 'em.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.627
- Looks like they were
all shot multiple times.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.396
- Yeah.
Look at the bodies.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.764
Clearly not a pro.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.599
- Carnage suggests rage,
meaning that this

03:18.666 --> 03:20.501
wasn't some random drive-by.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.103
Our unsub was targeting
these lawyers.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.472
- Three prosecutors.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.006
Is that the entirety
of the county's DA office?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.641
- Nearly.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.511
Katherine Sloane, age 26,
Peter Hill, age 29,

03:30.578 --> 03:32.280
Johnnie Mow, age 28,

03:32.346 --> 03:34.114
and then there's the district
attorney himself, Skip Hardy.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.283
- He survived?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.517
- He wasn't there
in the first place.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.751
- Where was he?
- I don't know.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.219
- You and I are
gonna go ask him.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.888
Everyone else,
I want boots on the ground

03:40.954 --> 03:42.155
for whatever you can find,
witnesses,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.325
surveillance footage,
victim profiles.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.526
We need to find this unsub

03:45.593 --> 03:46.494
before he takes
someone else out.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.396
Let's roll.

03:48.462 --> 03:51.332
* *

03:51.399 --> 03:53.567
I have to ask,

03:53.634 --> 03:56.069
why weren't you with them
last night?

03:56.737 --> 03:58.205
- I don't drink.

03:58.272 --> 04:02.042
I usually leave the victory
celebrations to my deputies.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.613
I feel terrible.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.348
I should have been
there with them.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.849
- Where were you?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.951
- I was at my Bible study
last night.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.820
A big group of us,
including the mayor.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.655
- We'll need a list
of names to confirm.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.657
I apologize.
We have to be thorough.

04:16.724 --> 04:19.327
- Yeah, I get it.
I've tried the cases.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.529
Mom and kids murdered
while Dad's on vacation.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.097
Chances are, Dad's your guy.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.268
- Is that how you thought
about your office?

04:28.336 --> 04:30.904
Like family?

04:30.971 --> 04:36.810
- My deputies,
they called me their work dad.

04:36.877 --> 04:41.148
Those kids were smart,
driven, relentless.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.752
I may have been their boss,

04:44.818 --> 04:46.820
but they were the ones
teaching me.

04:46.887 --> 04:50.458
- Did any of them have
any enemies that you know of?

04:50.524 --> 04:52.025
- Hundreds.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.461
Your job is
to get the bad guys,

04:53.527 --> 04:55.563
you run the risk of the bad
guys getting you back.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.365
I reckon you both know
what that's like.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.067
- So you think this is revenge
from an aggrieved defendant?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.536
- Forrest City
may be a small town,

05:02.603 --> 05:05.739
but we're the St. Francis
County seat.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.376
We try everything from arson
to aggravated theft

05:08.442 --> 05:09.910
to first-degree murder.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.046
And these are from
the last five years,

05:13.113 --> 05:14.782
all violent offenders,
all with axes

05:14.848 --> 05:17.184
to grind against my office.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.820
Bastard's got to be in here.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.255
- Our team will help you
with these.

05:23.256 --> 05:25.092
- Thank you.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.095
[tense music]

05:28.161 --> 05:31.164
* *

05:31.231 --> 05:32.400
- Was that Remy?

05:32.466 --> 05:33.634
- Yeah, they confirmed
the DA's alibi.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.035
He's cleared.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.604
- Well, I hope you
brought your popcorn.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.605
- Oh, yeah?
What are we watching?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.172
- Hana versus Betamax.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.742
- Yeah, mock the millennial,
not the genius

05:41.809 --> 05:46.013
who decided to install
an analog CCTV system.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.081
OK, finally.

05:50.317 --> 05:57.257
* *

06:00.160 --> 06:01.962
- No, from this angle,
we can kiss any hope

06:02.029 --> 06:03.263
of facial rec goodbye.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.798
Play it again.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.901
* *

06:07.968 --> 06:12.840
- So that's Johnnie,
and there's Kat and Pete.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.476
- Looks like they were
more than just coworkers.

06:15.543 --> 06:19.647
* *

06:19.713 --> 06:22.149
- See how fast
she turns around?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.617
It takes Pete and Johnnie
at least five seconds

06:23.684 --> 06:24.818
to turn and follow.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.754
- Driver must have
called Kat's name.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.088
- Our unsub knew her.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.090
- OK, so the DA's office
wasn't the target.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.892
It was Kat.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.260
So let's pull
all her phone calls,

06:33.326 --> 06:35.663
emails, texts,
both work and personal.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.997
Did she have family
in the area?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.866
- Yeah, her parents
live five minutes away.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.234
- I'll let Remy know.

06:41.301 --> 06:45.405
* *

06:45.473 --> 06:49.076
- The only thing Katherine ever
wanted to be was a lawyer.

06:49.142 --> 06:53.614
She was so smart, so fierce.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.283
- We were so proud.

06:56.349 --> 07:00.588
I just--I can't believe
this is happening.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.856
Arranging
your own child's funeral.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.526
- We are so sorry.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.796
No family should ever have
to go through this.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.132
- Can you tell us
about your daughter's work?

07:12.199 --> 07:14.702
- Kat was on the judge track.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.270
Her first year
with the DA's office,

07:17.337 --> 07:21.041
and she still
hadn't lost a case.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.243
- During that time,
did she receive any threats,

07:23.310 --> 07:27.180
mysterious phone calls,
suspicious cars on the street?

07:27.247 --> 07:30.383
- I don't think so,
but I don't know.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.986
She spent most nights at her
boyfriend's up in Caldwell.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.556
- We'll talk to
Pete Hill's family.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.957
- Kat's coworker?

07:37.024 --> 07:39.159
That's not who she was dating.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.495
- Her boyfriend's name
is Eli Dorflinger.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.263
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.330 --> 07:50.237
* *

07:50.303 --> 07:52.039
- Blood.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.975
- FBI!
Drop the knife, Eli.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.177
- Come out slowly.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.380
Get down on the ground.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.451
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.254
Do you have any weapons on you?
- No.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.925
* *

08:11.992 --> 08:14.461
I was just cleaning this guy.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.196
It's a kindness, really.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.331
Wild hogs wreak havoc
on the ecosystem.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.836
- OK, get up.
Get up.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.841
- You're FBI.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.376
What's going on?

08:29.442 --> 08:31.478
- We need to know
where you were last night.

08:31.545 --> 08:34.081
- On my way to a duck blind.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.617
- Hunting
in the middle of the night?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.552
- Hardy's
almost three hours away.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.021
I had to wake up early
to make it before sunrise.

08:41.088 --> 08:43.724
Please, what's going on?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.125
- Eli, I'm sorry to tell you

08:45.192 --> 08:48.295
that Kat Sloane was murdered
last night.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.163
- She what?

08:50.230 --> 08:53.100
- We understand the two of you
were in a relationship.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.036
- We were together
almost four years.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.338
I don't understand.

08:58.405 --> 09:00.340
How did this happen?
- Well, you tell us.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.575
You must have
been pretty pissed

09:01.642 --> 09:03.276
when you found out
about her and Pete Hill,

09:03.343 --> 09:04.745
maybe enough to grab one
of your rifles and--

09:04.812 --> 09:07.480
- Wait.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.249
Kat was cheating on me?

09:09.316 --> 09:16.456
* *

09:17.024 --> 09:18.692
- Lunch with a client?
- Something like that.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.493
- I hope you're billing
those hours, partner.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.495
- Always, man.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.373
- Hey, Scott.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.276
- You're late.
You have my money?

09:36.343 --> 09:39.112
- Yep,
and a little something extra.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.182
Let's take a drive, amigo.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.387
Get in.

09:47.454 --> 09:52.559
* *

09:59.266 --> 10:00.734
- We can cross Kat's boyfriend,
Eli, off our list of suspects.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.602
He was freezing his ass off
in the woods all night

10:02.670 --> 10:04.037
in a hunting blind.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.505
- How's it going
with the DA's files?

10:05.572 --> 10:06.539
- It's a slog.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.141
If I have to read one more case

10:08.208 --> 10:10.878
about the illegal distribution
of moonshine, I'm gonna barf.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.080
- The sheriff cleared every
single person in this county

10:13.146 --> 10:14.247
with an arrest warrant.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.883
- So we're nowhere on suspects

10:15.949 --> 10:17.918
unless Hana has
any luck with the tip line.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.820
- I got something
on the tip line.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.989
- We got to take this act
on the road.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.191
- An anonymous caller
overheard, quote,

10:24.257 --> 10:27.661
"two Latino gang-looking guys"
boasting about the murder

10:27.728 --> 10:29.963
of the guys
that put their boss in prison.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.732
- Caller didn't leave a name?
- Probably too scared.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.133
Especially if these guys
look like gangbangers.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.534
When did the call come in?

10:34.601 --> 10:37.204
- About 30 minutes ago
from Hal's Sanitary Diner.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.106
- Mmm, sounds yummy.
Close by?

10:39.172 --> 10:41.274
- Everything here is close.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.110
[door bell chimes]

10:45.078 --> 10:46.379
- Agent Scott, FBI.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.781
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.182
- About?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.518
- Three county prosecutors
were murdered last night.

10:51.584 --> 10:54.321
- I know.
Everybody's talking about it.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.256
But I didn't know them,
and I don't know anything

10:56.323 --> 10:57.524
about what happened.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.026
- Got a call
about two potential suspects

10:59.092 --> 11:01.561
who were eating here
about an hour ago.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.063
- I don't want any trouble.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.765
- We're not trying
to get you in trouble.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.300
We just want to talk.
- Hey, Millie.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.302
Is that four-top available?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.104
- Yeah, I just bussed it.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.942
- It's not polite to talk
business on an empty stomach.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.210
Mind if we sit?
- Sure.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.247
- All right.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.818
Mm.
Ah, thank you.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.088
Oh, biscuits and gravy.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.323
Now, these two aren't fans,
but I believe that's

11:30.390 --> 11:32.659
because they haven't had them
the right way, hm?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.161
With a little kick.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.930
- Hal makes ours
with jalapeños and Rotel.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.399
- See, now,
that sounds delicious.

11:39.466 --> 11:40.734
Three orders, please.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.536
- Anything else?
- Coffee.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.705
- I'm good.
- I'm good, thanks.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.211
- Why are we wasting time
on this, man?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.113
- Man, it's not about
the biscuits, all right?

11:53.180 --> 11:55.282
It's about the gravy,
metaphorically speaking.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.884
- I'm not following.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.953
- You got to take it easy
with these folks down here, OK?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.721
You can't just go barging--
thank you.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.023
Appreciate it.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.157
One second.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.492
While we got you,

12:05.558 --> 12:07.560
these two men
that we got a tip about,

12:07.627 --> 12:09.229
Latino men,
the caller said

12:09.296 --> 12:11.098
they might've been
gang members or something.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.866
- Yeah, I waited on them.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.103
They sat over there,
ordered two three-plus-threes,

12:16.169 --> 12:17.537
paid cash, and left.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.272
- You happen to hear
what they were talking about?

12:19.339 --> 12:21.441
- No, I was real busy.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.211
But they weren't from
around here, I don't think.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.645
Never seen them before.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.547
- What did they look like?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.783
- Regular.
Kind of big.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.085
Definitely Hispanic.
- Mm-hmm.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.088
- One of them had a tattoo.
I remember that.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.791
- Perfect.
You know what that looked like?

12:37.858 --> 12:41.228
- Sort of like a snake thing
wrapped around a number?

12:42.729 --> 12:44.131
Here.
Give me that napkin.

12:44.197 --> 12:47.000
Probably easier
just to draw it.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.074
- Just saying, a little
Southern charm goes a long way.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.576
- Yeah, you're
a regular Andy Griffith.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.145
- Which makes you Barney Fife.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.915
Or Aunt Bee if she was younger.
- Rude.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.584
- Let me see
that drawing she made.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.621
This tattoo looks like
a gang call sign.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.091
I'm gonna see if Kristin
knows anything about it.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.061
- What's up with you?
- Nothing.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.595
I've just been thinking
about that argument

13:15.662 --> 13:16.930
we saw this morning.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.166
- The mom and the landlord?
- Yeah.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.268
Landlords like that
piss me off.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.237
They're predators, raising
the rent just because they can.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.974
Look, he's taking advantage of
a hardworking mom and her kid.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.942
- And by hardworking,
you mean attractive, right?

13:29.009 --> 13:32.012
- The two aren't
mutually exclusive, all right?

13:32.079 --> 13:34.814
He's a bully,
and what he's doing is wrong.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.716
So if I stand by
and just watch it happen,

13:36.783 --> 13:37.985
what does that make me?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.853
- You want dirt on him?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.654
- Now, we both know
that's a bureau violation.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.390
- Not from the secure database,

13:43.456 --> 13:45.258
just some open-source
reporting, old-school hacking.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.027
Why do you think the FBI

13:47.094 --> 13:48.561
recruited me
in the first place?

13:48.628 --> 13:49.897
- The guys
our tipster overheard

13:49.963 --> 13:51.164
were members
of the 7th Street Serpents.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.366
It's a gang out
of West Memphis.

13:54.868 --> 13:58.038
Luis Trevino, king
of the 7th Street Serpents,

13:58.105 --> 14:00.874
convicted last month on charges
of federal racketeering.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.609
- I combed the DA files.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.077
There's no mention
of a Luis Trevino

14:04.144 --> 14:05.778
or anyone
from the 7th Street Serpents.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.480
- That's because
it was a federal case.

14:07.547 --> 14:10.217
Here's a quote from a press
conference last Thursday.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.019
"Federal officials
would like to thank

14:12.085 --> 14:13.820
"St. Francis County DA's office

14:13.887 --> 14:15.822
for their ongoing role
in the investigation."

14:15.889 --> 14:17.657
- So our prosecutors'
investigative efforts

14:17.724 --> 14:19.026
helped put Luis away.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.994
- And thanks to the public
shout-out, he knew.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.395
It sounds like a motive to me.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.832
- Luis is awaiting trial
at FDC here in Forrest City.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.367
He's been there
since he got indicted.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.070
- So if he did order a hit
on our prosecutors,

14:30.137 --> 14:31.671
it would have had
to come from a phone.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.773
- How?
All the calls are monitored.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.608
- Not the ones
from his lawyers.

14:35.675 --> 14:38.545
- So you're thinking Luis used
his attorney to order the hit.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.314
- If he did, that's a crime.
Conversation's not protected.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.450
Call Kristin and Barnes.
Tell them to get a warrant.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.851
Head over
to the detention center.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.453
See if there's anything
on their recordings.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.922
* *

14:48.989 --> 14:51.959
- Last call Luis made
to his lawyer was yesterday.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.161
- So the morning
of the shooting.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.864
- The hell's the holdup
with my appeal, man?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.399
- That's Luis.
- You're kidding me, right?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.001
- That's his attorney,
Scott Thomas.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.469
- I already told you,
I'm not filing

15:02.535 --> 15:04.471
another piece of paperwork
until I get paid.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.772
I don't work for free, Luis.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.740
- All right.
All right, chill.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.176
Get my brother-in-law
on the line.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.144
- Have they run this
three-way call game before?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.712
- I don't know,
I couldn't listen

15:12.779 --> 15:14.014
to any
attorney-client recordings

15:14.081 --> 15:15.715
before y'all came
with your warrant.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.717
- You see this
in cartel cases a lot.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.086
Represent your client by day,

15:19.152 --> 15:20.753
run their drug business
from prison by night.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.489
- ¿Bueno?
- Hermano.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.057
My lawyer wants to get paid.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.592
- Tell him to take a number.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.527
- No, we should pay him.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.297
And, Javi, give him
a little something extra.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.799
He earned it.
- Earned it?

15:32.865 --> 15:35.435
He lost Luis' trial.
- No, this is a hit.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.204
Luis isn't telling Javier
to pay his lawyer.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.172
He's telling him to kill him.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.141
Probably arranged
the DA murders the same way.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.910
- Luis orders,
Javier executes.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.313
- That's right.
You know this brother-in-law?

15:46.379 --> 15:49.216
- Yeah.
He's been in here to see Luis.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.985
Should have his info
in the visitor logs.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.488
Javier Perez.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.959
He lives in Madison.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.929
[dramatic music]

16:02.996 --> 16:10.103
* *

16:23.316 --> 16:24.451
- FBI!

16:24.517 --> 16:26.086
- I'll go around the side.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.393
[gunfire]

16:40.067 --> 16:41.634
- FBI! Freeze!

16:41.701 --> 16:42.969
- [grunts]

16:43.036 --> 16:50.143
* *

16:51.278 --> 16:53.313
- Guys, in here.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.217
That's him.

16:57.284 --> 17:00.019
That's Luis' attorney.
- Quiet and quick.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.488
Get a coroner down here.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.123
I'm gonna call the DA,
tell him we got the douchebag

17:03.190 --> 17:04.991
who killed his people.

17:06.659 --> 17:09.462
[keypad beeping]

17:18.471 --> 17:20.807
- Thank you for your help,
Prosecutor.

17:20.873 --> 17:26.679
* *

17:26.746 --> 17:29.882
[phone ringing]

17:38.891 --> 17:40.827
- Hi, this is Dale Torres

17:40.893 --> 17:42.595
at Hawkins and Associates
Law Firm.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.231
Sorry I can't take your call
right now.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.733
Leave your name and number,
and I'll call you back.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.370
- Mr. Torres, this is
Agent Ray Cannon with the FBI.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.938
Look, I have
some urgent information

17:52.004 --> 17:53.573
regarding your partner,
Scott Thomas.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.741
I need you
to give me a call back

17:54.807 --> 17:56.509
at this number
as soon as possible.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.547
I just tried to notify
Thomas' law partner.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.115
Got the voicemail.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.750
- Hey, check this out.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.286
Now, this is from the gun
that Javier was using.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.388
I took a picture of it
and sent it to ballistics.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.656
Now, it doesn't match
the shell casings

18:09.722 --> 18:10.957
that were found
outside the bar.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.492
- Where the three prosecutors
were killed?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.661
- Mm-hmm, which means that
this is not the murder weapon.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.628
- All right,
but it doesn't mean

18:15.695 --> 18:17.096
that Javier didn't kill them.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.699
He could've been smart
and switched out the gun.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.968
- Or somebody else did it
with a different gun.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.770
- Look, Kristin said that
what she heard on the tape

18:23.836 --> 18:26.105
was Luis ordering Javier
to make the hit.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.874
- On his own lawyer, yeah,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.442
but they didn't talk
about the prosecutors,

18:29.509 --> 18:30.977
at least
not in that conversation.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.313
- So you really don't think
that Javier is our fugitive.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.582
- I don't know, but we do have
to go back in that house

18:35.648 --> 18:36.916
and try and find
a different gun.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.218
- All right.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.453
[phone ringing]

18:40.520 --> 18:41.788
Hey, Remy.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.890
Hey.
What did the DA have to say?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.359
- He never answered my calls.
I just found out why.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.660
Somebody killed him.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.396
- You're kidding me. When?

18:49.462 --> 18:50.697
- Not sure yet.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.864
Courthouse bailiff
found him dead

18:51.931 --> 18:53.333
on the floor
of his office.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.001
I'm meeting
Barnes and Kristin there now.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.436
Talk soon.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.871
- Well, this case
just got a lot weirder.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.873
- You're telling me
nobody saw or heard anything?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.509
- Nothing, no,
I found him like this

19:02.575 --> 19:03.843
making my nightly rounds.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.478
- Why hasn't the scene
been processed?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.514
- Why weren't you here sooner?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.882
Four dead lawyers may be
no big deal in New York,

19:09.949 --> 19:12.285
but my town is paralyzed
by this.

19:12.352 --> 19:16.055
A whole courthouse
being picked off, one by one.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.925
- Sheriff, one dead is one too
many, as far as I'm concerned,

19:18.991 --> 19:21.494
but playing the blame game
just gives our perp more time

19:21.561 --> 19:23.095
to plot his next move.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.799
- Why does the DA have a safe?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.301
- Oh, evidence storage.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.270
I put sensitive stuff in there
Skip needs for court.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.971
- Open it.
- Yeah.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.808
[keypad beeping]

19:37.444 --> 19:40.112
Well, that's weird.
- What?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.215
- Skip was in the middle
of a fentanyl possession trial,

19:42.282 --> 19:43.683
and I put a baggie of it
in there yesterday.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.485
And now it's gone.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.153
- Who's on trial in that case?

19:47.220 --> 19:50.357
- A guy named Jimmy Burnett.
I actually arrested him myself.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.824
- We need to see his file,

19:51.891 --> 19:53.393
and I want to talk to
the courthouse security team.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.461
- Well, that'd be me.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.695
- Courthouse has cameras,
correct?

19:55.762 --> 19:56.729
- Not in the offices,

19:56.796 --> 19:58.130
but in all the courtrooms

19:58.197 --> 19:59.766
and the garage entrance.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.468
The surveillance office
is in the basement.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.403
I could show you.
- Yeah, I got it.

20:03.470 --> 20:10.610
* *

20:12.178 --> 20:14.714
- Body's still warm.
He's nowhere near rigor.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.349
This happened
in the last two hours.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.185
- At which point, Javier's body
was on his way to the morgue.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.187
So there's no way
he can be our unsub.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.722
- The killer has to work
in the courthouse, right?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.257
Someone who could
gain entry late at night.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.459
- No one can enter
or exit after hours

20:26.526 --> 20:27.860
without swiping their badge.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.330
- Who was here tonight?
- We can check the logs.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.798
- Let's do it.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.802
- Well, Skip's the only one
who hasn't swiped out.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.604
- Come on, dude.
Besides him.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.071
- It looks like
the last person to leave

20:39.138 --> 20:41.841
was Joanna Orr,
public defender.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.311
- What time?
- 6:03 p.m.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.514
Oh, wait, no, that's the time
of her final swipe out,

20:47.580 --> 20:48.948
but she left once before that,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.418
at 5:15,
and came back 20 minutes later.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.219
- Where does Joanna live?
- Not far.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.288
Over by the Walmart.
- Call Hana and Ray.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.524
Get over there now.
Lock this woman down.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.725
- You don't think
Joanna did this?

20:58.791 --> 20:59.859
There's no way.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.861
- Let's look
at the security footage.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.467
- Only got cameras on the
bottom floor of the garage.

21:07.534 --> 21:09.268
- Luckily,
Joanna Orr parks there.

21:09.336 --> 21:12.372
Her badge swiped in
at the entrance at 5:35 p.m.,

21:12.439 --> 21:15.274
right about now.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.977
- Is that Joanna's car?
- I don't think so.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.012
No, she drives a 2014 Mazda.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.214
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Black SUV.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.283
That look familiar?
- Yeah, from outside the bar.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.485
That's our unsub's vehicle.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.086
- Rewind.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.823
- Stop.
- Zoom in.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.827
- 28K-XQ8.

21:34.894 --> 21:35.928
- Which employee
drives a vehicle

21:35.995 --> 21:37.664
with that plate number?

21:40.867 --> 21:42.902
- Judge Roarke.
- What?

21:42.969 --> 21:44.737
- Circuit judge, division six.
[phone ringing]

21:44.804 --> 21:46.506
His courtroom's upstairs.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.307
- Kristin, hey.
- Remy, listen.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.109
Joanna Orr wasn't
at the courthouse tonight.

21:50.176 --> 21:51.511
She bumped into someone
in the parking garage,

21:51.578 --> 21:53.012
and her badge was stolen.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.715
The guy we're looking for is--
- Howard Roarke, I know.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.917
Our fugitive is
a sitting judge,

21:57.984 --> 21:59.586
and he's murdering prosecutors.

21:59.652 --> 22:02.254
* *

22:08.595 --> 22:10.830
- All right.
BOLO's out on Roarke's SUV.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.732
Find anything interesting
in his background?

22:12.799 --> 22:16.135
- Hardly.
This guy's a total snooze.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.570
Born in Forrest City.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.606
Graduated Georgetown Law
in '94,

22:19.672 --> 22:22.542
then worked in the Baltimore
DA's office until '09.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.377
- OK, and then became a judge.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.045
- Carried a briefcase
for a few years,

22:26.112 --> 22:27.780
then ran his campaign
for criminal court justice

22:27.847 --> 22:30.383
against an incumbent,
which he won,

22:30.450 --> 22:32.919
and has been on the bench
ever since.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.121
- Talk about a career pivot.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.323
Respected judge
turned serial killer

22:37.390 --> 22:38.625
of basically every prosecutor

22:38.691 --> 22:40.026
who's ever had a case
before him.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.595
- The question is, why?

22:42.662 --> 22:44.196
- Guys.

22:44.263 --> 22:45.932
- Find anything?
- Motive, I think.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.535
Now, Kat tried a case six
months ago in front of Roarke.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.802
The defendant was charged

22:49.869 --> 22:51.771
with two counts
of felony sexual assault.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.606
- So she won.
- The trial, yes.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.341
The sentencing was
a different story.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.076
Now, she argued
for ten years in prison,

22:57.143 --> 22:59.646
but Roarke gave the defendant
two years, the minimum.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.614
- To say we're disappointed

23:01.681 --> 23:03.716
in Judge Roarke's
insultingly light sentence

23:03.783 --> 23:05.718
would be an understatement.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.454
The last thing
sexual assault victims

23:07.520 --> 23:09.155
need added to the injury
that they face

23:09.221 --> 23:11.691
in the court of public opinion
is the insult

23:11.758 --> 23:15.361
of being disrespected
by the bench too.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.430
- First year on the job,
speaking truth to power.

23:17.497 --> 23:18.898
I'd say that's courage.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.601
- No wonder
her parents were proud of her.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.170
- No wonder
Roarke was so pissed.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.973
[phone ringing]
- Hello?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.341
- This is
the third time I've called.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.910
I don't like being ignored.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.344
- [whispering]
I'm not--

23:32.411 --> 23:34.213
I'm not ignoring you.
I'm at work.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.148
- You talk to the police
or the FBI?

23:36.215 --> 23:38.384
- No.
- Don't lie to me.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.219
- Judge, I'm not.
I swear.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.654
I didn't even know
the FBI was here.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.189
- Calm down.
- I can't.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.057
- Yes, you can.

23:45.124 --> 23:46.192
You're not finished.

23:46.258 --> 23:47.827
- What?

23:47.894 --> 23:49.762
- I have something else
I need you to do.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.998
- Judge, Judge, please,
I did what you asked.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.265
I don't want to do any more.

23:53.332 --> 23:55.034
- I don't care what you want.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.936
This is my time now.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.438
My terms and my rules.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.574
They thought I would
just sit back and take it,

24:01.641 --> 24:04.110
but they were wrong,
and they're all gonna pay.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.846
- Who is? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.315
- You will soon enough.
They all will.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.650
You have your laptop?

24:10.717 --> 24:13.452
- Yeah, but like I said,
I'm at work.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.687
- Then tell them
you need a break.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.455
Go get it and call me back.

24:16.523 --> 24:19.358
Knowing you,
this won't take long.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.627
- I can't.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.995
- I will make this very clear.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.564
If you don't do what I ask,

24:24.631 --> 24:26.666
it's not just you
I'm gonna find.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.702
It's your mother
and your boyfriend in Brinkley.

24:29.769 --> 24:30.937
Eric, right?

24:31.003 --> 24:33.372
- Oh, my God.
You know about him?

24:33.439 --> 24:36.643
- What's wrong?
You ashamed or something?

24:36.709 --> 24:38.545
I thought your kind
was all about pride

24:38.611 --> 24:39.779
and shouting it
from the rooftops

24:39.846 --> 24:41.147
and making it
so none of the rest of us

24:41.213 --> 24:43.249
can't get a word in edgewise.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.151
You got five minutes.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.219
I'll be waiting.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.421
[phone beeps]

24:50.156 --> 24:52.258
- Mrs. Roarke?

24:52.324 --> 24:53.993
- Call me Cynthia.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.763
I don't want to be associated
with his name anymore.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.631
- I know this is
a lot to take in.

24:58.698 --> 25:03.803
- [scoffs]
It is, and it isn't.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.773
I stopped recognizing the man
I married a long time ago.

25:06.839 --> 25:10.543
He'd become so mean, so angry.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.545
And I'm not trying
to excuse it.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.080
I just want you to
understand that--

25:14.146 --> 25:16.048
- He wasn't always like this.

25:16.115 --> 25:17.483
- Not at all.

25:17.550 --> 25:21.921
When we met, he was kind,
thoughtful, ambitious.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.824
Sure, but in the name
of a selfless cause, the law.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.859
- Was he already a judge
when you met?

25:26.926 --> 25:28.127
- No.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.262
No, we met when he moved
back from Baltimore.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.864
2010.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.933
He'd run for district attorney
there and lost,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.669
so he came back to Forrest City
shortly after.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.404
- Probably thought
he'd had more party support

25:38.470 --> 25:40.239
in his home county.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.241
- Which he got
from marrying me.

25:42.308 --> 25:45.945
My father was chief of police,
and everyone knows my mom.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.315
Her family owns
the largest farm in Stuttgart.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.584
Anyway, that was
all a long time ago,

25:51.651 --> 25:54.320
before his career stalled out.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.022
Lately, all he did was stew.

25:56.088 --> 25:58.725
His law school classmates,
his former colleagues,

25:58.791 --> 26:00.727
they all seemed to be working
their way up to higher office

26:00.793 --> 26:02.795
while he was stuck
on circuit court bench.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.463
- Is that what
made him so angry?

26:04.530 --> 26:05.865
- Big time.

26:05.932 --> 26:08.067
Blamed it on the system
for holding him back,

26:08.134 --> 26:09.736
keeping him stuck.

26:09.802 --> 26:12.605
- All due respect, I'd argue
that men like your husband

26:12.672 --> 26:14.306
created that system.

26:14.373 --> 26:17.576
- You try telling him that,
see what it gets you.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.912
He left me with this.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.884
- He did that to you?

26:24.951 --> 26:28.354
- Five days ago,
he came home from a meeting

26:28.420 --> 26:31.824
furious, screaming,
throwing things.

26:31.891 --> 26:33.626
When he turned on me,
I packed his bags

26:33.693 --> 26:35.527
and told him to get out.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.129
He was gone the next day.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.597
- Who was he meeting with?

26:38.665 --> 26:41.934
- An old friend of his,
Arthur Hobbs.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.136
He's president
of the State Bar.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.575
- Roarke and I clerked
together in D.C.,

26:49.642 --> 26:52.278
so I guess that's why
I hoped our meeting

26:52.344 --> 26:53.512
wouldn't hit him so hard.

26:53.579 --> 26:54.781
- What were you meeting about?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.816
- I'm chair
of the nominating commission

26:56.883 --> 26:58.885
for the Arkansas
Court of Appeals.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.120
Howard had applied
for an open vacancy,

27:01.187 --> 27:03.622
and I had to give him
the bad news.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.991
- He didn't get it.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.325
- No.

27:06.392 --> 27:09.796
He was under serious
consideration at first.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.364
We didn't realize we had
a problem until we started

27:12.431 --> 27:15.601
sending out JNEs,
surveys regarding

27:15.668 --> 27:17.770
the judicial nominees,
basically.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.806
- Sent to people
who know the candidate.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.407
- Right.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.844
Respondents' names and answers
are always kept confidential,

27:24.911 --> 27:26.879
so we know
we're getting the truth.

27:26.946 --> 27:30.416
- Which was what,
exactly, for Roarke?

27:30.482 --> 27:31.951
- Ugly.

27:32.018 --> 27:34.687
Allegations
of sexual harassment,

27:34.754 --> 27:37.023
bribes, improper bias.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.091
Frankly,
temperament unbefitting

27:39.158 --> 27:40.359
a traffic court judge,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.394
much less a justice
of the Court of Appeals.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.863
- Did you tell him
what you found?

27:43.930 --> 27:48.500
- Yeah, and I told him never
to apply again.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.636
As an old friend,
I was doing him a favor

27:50.703 --> 27:53.072
by doing so discreetly.

27:53.139 --> 27:56.308
He'd become something
of an activist judge

27:56.375 --> 27:57.977
the last few years.

27:58.044 --> 28:00.579
- In a save the whales
kind of way?

28:00.646 --> 28:04.416
- More of a save
the marginalized white man

28:04.483 --> 28:05.952
kind of way.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.354
- Well, we know of one
controversial rape case ruling.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.957
Was his issue with people
of color, as well as women?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.559
- Yes.
LGBT community too.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.427
Whatever the opposite
of woke is,

28:15.494 --> 28:16.829
that's what Howard had become.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.430
It wasn't a good look.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.766
- I'd say that look's
gotten worse

28:19.832 --> 28:21.500
since he's wanted
for the murder of four people,

28:21.567 --> 28:23.535
including the St. Francis DA.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.371
- What?
Skip Hardy?

28:25.437 --> 28:26.939
- You knew him?

28:27.006 --> 28:28.775
- We finalized our shortlist
of nominations

28:28.841 --> 28:31.343
for the open vacancy yesterday.

28:31.410 --> 28:32.711
- Let me guess.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.981
Skip Hardy was
on the top of the list.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.484
- So Roarke just had
any chance of career

28:38.550 --> 28:41.087
advancement crushed on year
seven of an eight-year term.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.322
- Meaning he'd be facing
reelection next year

28:43.389 --> 28:45.892
as a divorcee of the most
well-connected woman

28:45.958 --> 28:47.326
in St. Francis County.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.261
- For a guy whose veins pump
with ambition in place

28:49.328 --> 28:51.998
of blood, that's a sentence
worse than death.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.567
So he snaps, kills Kat,
who publicly humiliated him

28:55.634 --> 28:56.702
after his rape case
sentencing.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.537
- Then kills Skip Hardy,
a Black man

28:58.604 --> 29:00.006
who made
the commission's shortlist

29:00.072 --> 29:01.808
for Roarke's beloved appellate
court instead of him.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.709
- But why kill Pete Hill
and Johnnie Mow?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.912
- Are either of them
in the JNE files?

29:05.978 --> 29:08.647
- Yes, both Johnnie
and Pete have JNEs.

29:08.714 --> 29:11.083
They both gave
Roarke bad reviews.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.786
- There it is.
- Those files are confidential.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.988
How'd Roarke get 'em?
- I'm looking into it now.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.990
If someone hacked the server
before me, I'll find them.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.126
- Bottom line,
Roarke's furious the universe

29:20.192 --> 29:23.262
hasn't bestowed upon him the
accolades he feels he's owed.

29:23.329 --> 29:24.897
- So instead of taking
responsibility for it,

29:24.964 --> 29:26.498
he takes his rage out
on the people

29:26.565 --> 29:29.435
he thinks halted his success
because of their own.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.837
- OK, I got it.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.872
The appellate
commission's server

29:32.939 --> 29:36.242
was hacked by an IP address
registered to a Samuel Gray.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.811
He's on probation
after serving time for hacking.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.279
Guess who sentenced him.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.082
- The Honorable
Judge Howard Roarke.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.683
- Looks like he works
at a catfish restaurant

29:44.750 --> 29:45.818
about a half mile from here.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.920
I'm dropping you a pin now.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.721
- Got it.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.691
[dramatic music]

29:52.758 --> 29:59.899
* *

30:02.501 --> 30:05.171
- Oh, hey, Chip.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.374
You know our VIP patient
will be here soon, right?

30:08.440 --> 30:09.741
- I'm ready.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.444
- All right.
Well, I'm off.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.479
Good luck.

30:13.545 --> 30:15.414
- Have a good one.

30:15.481 --> 30:22.388
* *

30:23.355 --> 30:24.823
- I didn't have a choice.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.392
Howard said either hack the
appellate commission server,

30:26.458 --> 30:27.759
or he'd revoke my probation.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.328
So I sent him the JNEs.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.030
- Then what, Sam?
You're deep in here.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.464
Come on.
Keep talking.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.599
- He called me two hours ago,

30:33.665 --> 30:35.134
asked me to hack
into Health Forward Labs

30:35.201 --> 30:36.468
and get him
their employee directory.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.070
- Health Forward Labs, why?
- I don't know.

30:38.137 --> 30:40.572
He didn't say.
- Hey, Remy.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.208
Roarke's SUV
was found abandoned

30:42.274 --> 30:44.443
on a residential street
in Crystal Hill.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.745
When PD went door-to-door
looking for witnesses,

30:46.812 --> 30:48.247
they found a neighbor dead.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.815
His name was Chip Fox.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.350
- Never heard of him.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.352
I don't know anything
about this, I swear.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.486
- Get him out of here.

30:54.553 --> 30:55.888
- I didn't--please.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.789
- Found him.
Chip Fox, 52 years old.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.325
No criminal record.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.127
Works as a scrub tech
at Health Forward Labs.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.494
- What's his connection
to Roarke?

31:02.561 --> 31:03.896
- I don't know.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.297
The only thing that pops up
when I search him online

31:05.364 --> 31:08.067
is this article from the
"Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"

31:08.134 --> 31:10.903
where Chip Fox is quoted
as a front-line worker.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.106
Says he personally COVID
tested governor Nancy Novak

31:14.173 --> 31:15.874
three times
at St. Michael's Hospital

31:15.942 --> 31:17.176
in Little Rock last week.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.710
- I'm just surprised
we didn't find

31:18.777 --> 31:20.379
Governor Novak's face on a
dart board in Roarke's office.

31:20.446 --> 31:23.282
As governor, she's the one
who picks the next justice

31:23.349 --> 31:25.084
for the Court of Appeals.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.653
- He remind you of anyone?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.989
- Early 50s,
hazel eyes, he's bald.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.491
He looks like Roarke.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.061
- Chip has no connections
to the legal system,

31:35.127 --> 31:36.428
so this wasn't revenge.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.730
What if Roarke went to him
for the same reason

31:38.797 --> 31:41.333
he bumped into Joanna Orr,
to steal his ID?

31:41.400 --> 31:43.269
- But why kill him
in the process?

31:43.335 --> 31:45.604
- Because if Chip Fox is dead,
he won't be clocking in

31:45.671 --> 31:47.773
to work today, leaving Roarke
to show up in his place.

31:47.839 --> 31:50.376
- Roarke is impersonating Chip
to get close to the governor

31:50.442 --> 31:51.710
of Arkansas.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.879
He's going after her next.

32:00.052 --> 32:02.955
[tense music]

32:03.022 --> 32:08.760
* *

32:08.827 --> 32:11.630
- Hey, I got the governor
for COVID testing.

32:11.697 --> 32:12.864
Thanks.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.101
Yep, photo ID?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.368
All right.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.570
Looks like I'm going first.
- [chuckles]

32:18.637 --> 32:21.007
- All right.
Head back for me, please.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.709
- [coughing]
- Really?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.045
And they trust you with a gun.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.016
- Head back for me, please.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.318
- Watch and learn, Daniel.

32:34.820 --> 32:35.854
All right.

32:35.921 --> 32:36.922
Let's roll.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.557
I'm serious.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.360
I'll never hear the end of it
if I'm late to this fundraiser.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.829
- [choking]

32:43.895 --> 32:45.164
- Dan?

32:45.231 --> 32:46.865
Oh, my God.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.167
Help!

32:48.234 --> 32:50.469
He needs a doctor!

32:51.903 --> 32:53.772
- Here, brother.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.209
What happened?
- I don't know.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.178
I'm just a tech.
- Get a doctor.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.779
- Something's wrong.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.748
- Governor?

33:02.814 --> 33:04.450
- I don't feel well.
- Governor.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.085
Governor.
Stay with me.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.519
Stay with me.
Governor.

33:07.586 --> 33:09.321
Governor.
Governor.

33:09.388 --> 33:10.822
- Alert hospital security.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.358
Tell them to lock
the whole building down.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.925
- We do not want
to start a panic.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.528
The governor's SUV is
designed to withstand a bomb.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.929
- She's right.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.598
All right, Novak's detail
will put a bullet

33:19.665 --> 33:21.567
inside Roarke's head
before he can get a shot off.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.103
So unless he's learned how
to kill by osmosis...

33:25.971 --> 33:28.040
- How much fentanyl
was in Skip's safe?

33:28.107 --> 33:30.042
- Bailiff said the charge was
for second-degree possession.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.778
That means at least a gram,
and enough to kill someone.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.247
- Crushed up and coated
on a COVID swab,

33:35.314 --> 33:38.350
you'd be dead in minutes.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.685
[police siren wailing]

33:39.751 --> 33:41.287
- Breath is tachy.
- She's not breathing.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.954
- What do you got?
- Low pulse.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.290
- I got no vitals.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.358
- Fentanyl OD.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.160
- Narcan.
Give them Narcan.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.028
- Got it.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.499
Where'd he go?
- Who?

33:53.565 --> 33:55.501
- The guy that tested her.

33:55.567 --> 33:56.635
- I don't know.
He was right here.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.437
- She's alive.
She's breathing.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.472
- Spread out, he can't be far!

34:01.773 --> 34:04.009
FBI! Don't move!
- Got him.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.244
He's getting in his car.
- Hey, get down!

34:05.311 --> 34:07.179
Get down, down!
- Get down, get down!

34:07.246 --> 34:11.083
* *

34:11.150 --> 34:12.584
- Hey, move!
- Move!

34:12.651 --> 34:15.354
Get out of the way!
I don't have a shot.

34:15.421 --> 34:22.428
* *

34:22.494 --> 34:24.696
- I'll cut him off at the exit.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.969
[gunshots]

34:46.852 --> 34:48.620
- 38-2 responding
to shots fired

34:48.687 --> 34:51.723
at COVID testing site
at the hospital.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.393
- This is unit 622.
We are en route.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.229
[police siren wailing]

34:59.030 --> 35:01.467
- Good job.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.735
You did what you had to do.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.273
The governor all right?

35:07.339 --> 35:08.674
- Yeah.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.409
She's gonna make it.

35:10.476 --> 35:13.379
[soft music]

35:13.445 --> 35:20.586
* *

35:24.055 --> 35:26.225
- It's like a silent disco
in here.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.860
- Sorry, I'm just thinking.

35:28.927 --> 35:31.697
- About what, the case?

35:31.763 --> 35:34.866
- About all the hate.
What's it for?

35:34.933 --> 35:37.603
- Look, we got Roarke
before he killed the governor.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.171
He can't hurt anyone else.

35:39.238 --> 35:42.608
- Look, I'm not talking about
the most wanted murderers.

35:42.674 --> 35:45.277
I'm talking about the bigots.

35:45.344 --> 35:48.079
My high school counselor
who would never shut up

35:48.146 --> 35:50.649
about how
"surprisingly articulate" I was

35:50.716 --> 35:53.852
for a kid
from the Lower Ninth Ward.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.887
The crooked cops
my dad tried to put away,

35:55.954 --> 35:58.857
but somehow were set free
because of,

35:58.924 --> 36:02.961
ah, inconsistencies
in the investigation.

36:03.028 --> 36:06.232
That's code for a Black
FBI agent investigating

36:06.298 --> 36:07.533
a white sergeant, by the way.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.000
- Hm.

36:09.067 --> 36:12.137
- I'm talking about the ones
who refused to believe

36:12.204 --> 36:14.840
that I earned my Quantico spot
on my own merit,

36:14.906 --> 36:16.775
the ones who attribute
my success

36:16.842 --> 36:19.911
to the color of my skin.

36:19.978 --> 36:23.782
You know, I had to work twice
as hard to get half as far.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.052
[soft music]

36:27.118 --> 36:29.788
- Roarke really saw himself
as an endangered species,

36:29.855 --> 36:32.758
the victimized white man.

36:32.824 --> 36:35.727
- Oh, man,
I know a thousand Roarkes.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.196
- What about that landlord?
- What about him?

36:38.264 --> 36:40.198
- He's a Roarke.
- Oh, he's definitely a Roarke.

36:40.266 --> 36:42.601
- Yeah.

36:42.668 --> 36:44.636
- And the tenant
he was trying to evict--

36:44.703 --> 36:47.239
- Oh, the future Mrs. Cannon?
- Oh, whoa.

36:47.306 --> 36:51.009
Let's pump the brakes a little.
- [laughs]

36:51.877 --> 36:56.081
Look, it's gonna be her kid
who wears the scar.

36:56.147 --> 37:00.085
Hm?
I was 15 when Katrina hit.

37:00.151 --> 37:02.053
We thought the flood
was gonna be the hard part,

37:02.120 --> 37:04.823
but the real danger came after.

37:04.890 --> 37:09.127
Restructuring,
also known as gentrification.

37:10.462 --> 37:13.231
Restructured my uncle
right out of his home,

37:13.299 --> 37:15.367
my best friends
out of our school.

37:15.434 --> 37:18.704
You know, the folks
that moved in had the audacity

37:18.770 --> 37:21.440
to call my neighbors refugees.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.109
Like we were the interlopers.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.612
* *

37:26.678 --> 37:27.846
It's like watching the water

37:27.913 --> 37:29.648
bust through the levee
all over again.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.650
We couldn't do nothing
to plug it up.

37:34.453 --> 37:38.690
- That landlord's name
is Gunnar Jovanovic.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.126
I found some pretty heavy dirt
on him if you wanna hear it.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.894
- No.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.095
- Ray,
these are public records.

37:44.162 --> 37:45.464
We're not doing anything wrong.

37:45.531 --> 37:48.367
- I just--I don't feel good
digging like this.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.836
- Okay, fine, totally get it.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.905
I know that one person
couldn't change

37:53.972 --> 37:55.707
what happened in your city.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.610
But maybe you could change
what happens

37:58.677 --> 38:00.579
in this woman
and her son's life.

38:00.646 --> 38:07.786
* *

38:14.159 --> 38:16.962
- I didn't get to introduce
myself the other day.

38:17.028 --> 38:20.131
Special Agent Ray Cannon, FBI.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.535
- Hey, look,
this is all legal, OK?

38:23.602 --> 38:25.070
If they can't pay,
they can't stay.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.439
- Yeah, no.
I completely agree.

38:27.506 --> 38:31.076
Speaking of, who's gonna
move into your place?

38:31.142 --> 38:33.479
- What?
- Your apartment.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.347
Yeah, I was wondering
who was gonna move in

38:35.414 --> 38:37.749
when you go to prison
for tax evasion.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.886
See, raising the rent,
that's one thing.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.388
Skimming the difference
off the top,

38:42.454 --> 38:44.122
that's a whole 'nother animal.

38:44.189 --> 38:47.258
Now, by my calculations,
you owe $75,000 in back taxes.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.128
Now, I can call my buddies
down at the IRS

38:50.195 --> 38:52.698
and get this handled,
or you can draw up

38:52.764 --> 38:55.967
another lease
for these nice folks.

38:56.034 --> 38:59.805
I know what it looks like
when a bully games the system,

38:59.871 --> 39:01.840
but we're not gonna
have that today, right?

39:07.746 --> 39:10.416
- Wow, that was--

39:10.482 --> 39:11.483
thank you.

39:11.550 --> 39:12.918
- It's not a big deal.

39:12.984 --> 39:16.187
- Actually, it kind of is.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.691
I'm Cora,
and this is my son, Caleb.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.427
- I'm Ray.

39:21.493 --> 39:22.761
- You're really an FBI agent?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.295
- I sure am.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.764
- Can I see your gun?

39:25.831 --> 39:29.234
- No, I usually don't have it
when I'm not working.

39:29.300 --> 39:30.436
What about you?

39:30.502 --> 39:31.970
What do you want
to be when you grow up?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.171
- NFL quarterback,

39:33.238 --> 39:35.273
like Patrick Mahomes
or Lamar Jackson.

39:35.340 --> 39:37.108
- OK, all right.
Well, you know what?

39:37.175 --> 39:40.011
I look forward
to seeing you play one day.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.147
Can I help you take
these back inside?

39:42.213 --> 39:45.350
- Actually,
I have a better idea.

39:47.619 --> 39:48.954
Would you mind?

39:49.020 --> 39:50.288
I'm not very good.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.123
- Yeah, no worries.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.792
All right,
let's see what you got.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.894
All right?
Come on.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.231
- Ready?
- Yep.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.701
- Oh!

40:02.768 --> 40:04.770
OK.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.338
Yeah, kid's got an arm on him.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.641
- Actually,
he's got two of 'em.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.243
- I see what you did there.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.045
Funny.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.783
All right, young king.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.350
I'm going long, all right?

40:19.417 --> 40:21.620
- Ten hut.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.121
- Oh!
- Oh!

40:23.188 --> 40:24.523
- Let's go!
- Ready?

40:24.590 --> 40:26.892
Let's go.
[both grunting]

40:26.958 --> 40:29.495
- There we go, buddy.
[laughs]

40:29.561 --> 40:34.866

40:41.339 --> 40:44.242
[dramatic music]

40:44.309 --> 40:51.449

41:00.325 --> 41:01.993
