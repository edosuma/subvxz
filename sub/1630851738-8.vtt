01:02.729 --> 01:04.355
Mom says you ought to take a break.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.443
Grab the next.

01:12.947 --> 01:14.616
Agh!

01:19.954 --> 01:21.164
I'm no good at it.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.208
You're not patient.
That's different.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.001
Perhaps your gifts
weren't passed on to me.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.628
-It's true.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.254
War rages all around us,

01:28.338 --> 01:30.632
and all I can contribute
is stacking weapons

01:30.715 --> 01:32.717
made and wielded by better men.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.471
So what purpose do I serve in this world?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.974
You will find your calling, my son.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.186
Now, back to it.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.231
-Father, there's--
-I know!

02:28.314 --> 02:31.693
I need you to sneak out and run into town.
Alert Captain Crais and his--

02:31.776 --> 02:34.237
-There's too many of them. You need--
-Do as I say! Go!

02:36.573 --> 02:37.907
Peter! What is it?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.826
King's soldiers.
Hide in Miranda's room.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.494
Do not come out no matter what.

02:53.047 --> 02:54.299
Open up!

02:56.342 --> 02:57.635
What do you want?

02:57.719 --> 02:59.179
Well, good evening.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.931
You must be Peter Locke.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.433
And you are?

03:04.017 --> 03:07.687
Captain Frederick Gideon
of the Crown's 23rd Infantry.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.607
Rumor has it

03:11.608 --> 03:13.818
that you're manufacturing colonial weapons

03:13.902 --> 03:16.988
and stockpiling terrorist armaments
on your property.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.908
We thought we'd come
and have a look around.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.119
Rumors are ugly things, Captain.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.455
My family's asleep.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.667
So I'm going to ask you to leave.

03:32.170 --> 03:37.091
Shame on you for your bad manners,
not even inviting me in for a cup of tea!

03:38.301 --> 03:41.804
Did you not hear
that I'm an officer of your king?

03:44.641 --> 03:45.683
Search the house!

03:46.267 --> 03:47.602
You heard him. Let's go.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.604
You two, with me.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.190
Spread out over everything.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.571
We're looking for weapons!

04:04.118 --> 04:05.870
Oh God!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.874
Look what we found
along with eight barrels of gunpowder

04:09.958 --> 04:12.085
and stolen British guns in the attic.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.796
You and the men help yourselves
to their belongings.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.715
-No!
-We'll load it in the wagons.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.675
No!

04:18.758 --> 04:23.221
Leave it to one of His Majesty's officers
to steal what's not rightfully his!

04:24.722 --> 04:27.016
-Oh, Peter!
-I take care of my men.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.769
Peter!

04:29.852 --> 04:31.646
And my men take care of me.

04:42.573 --> 04:43.783
Anyone get any rest?

04:47.537 --> 04:48.830
Yeah.

04:49.330 --> 04:50.206
Me either.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.544
Why doesn't Gabe come after us?

04:55.044 --> 04:58.840
'Cause he's probably gonna
build an army first, turn more people.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.593
We need to warn our friends.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.263
All the Savinis,
anyone who knows about the keys,

05:06.014 --> 05:07.223
before they get turned.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.393
Maybe they can help us
get the key away from him.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.564
If Gabe's out there making more demons,
we can't just go over there unprotected.

05:16.399 --> 05:20.028
-I'll wear the Hercules belt.
-I can take the Matchstick Key.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.654
What about me?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.614
-You're going to school.
-What?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.116
Are you kidding me? No way.

05:25.199 --> 05:28.328
Look, we're gonna be armed,
and there isn't another key for you.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.039
-Your school is safest. He won't go there.
-What about Mom?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.206
I'll watch out for her.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.417
-I can't just sit in class!
-Yeah, you can.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.711
-Why can't I come?
-We said no. Stop pushing.

05:36.794 --> 05:40.256
-It's not fair!
-Hey! What's going on?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.259
Oh, just a little spirited
morning conversation.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.097
We're gonna be late. Coming, Kins?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.682
Yeah, just let me grab my stuff.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.652
Okay.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.237
What was that all about?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.741
Normal teenage stuff.
It's nothing to worry about.

06:06.824 --> 06:09.035
Hey, don't blow me off here, Duncan.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.788
Kinsey's having problems
with Gabe.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.998
Bode's upset because he and Gabe are buds,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.834
so Tyler and I,
just running some interference.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.295
Well, is she okay?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.839
I think so. She didn't get too specific.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.842
Teenagers don't like talking to adults
about this kind of stuff.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.887
No, but they do wanna
talk to you about it.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.306
I'm the "funcle." What can I tell you?

06:32.016 --> 06:33.226
It's fine, Nina.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.977
Please don't worry.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.483
Look, I'm waiting
on some parts for the GTO.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.110
I've got nothing to do.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.278
Maybe I can help.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.532
Need an intern at the theater today?

06:48.950 --> 06:51.411
Sure. I mean, if you really want to.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.789
I have always wanted an intern.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.083
Great! How do you take your coffee?

07:59.604 --> 08:01.439
Go ahead, eat.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.995
I guess I missed the invite to brunch.

08:16.787 --> 08:21.250
Luckily, your new errand boy drives a car
that you can see from space.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.712
What are you doing here, Eden?

08:24.795 --> 08:29.008
I'm willing to forgive and forget the fact
that you abandoned me at Keyhouse,

08:29.091 --> 08:31.177
seeing as we are partners.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.221
-We're nothing.
-Are you serious?

08:34.138 --> 08:36.766
You only have that key
because I helped you.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.559
It's basically half mine.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.686
I disagree.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.522
And so do they.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.403
This is your army?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.074
You could have turned
half this town by now.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.201
I'm not gonna waste this gift
on just anyone.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.703
-See all these demons?

08:58.454 --> 09:01.290
They're all helpful,
compliant, and obedient.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.709
Whereas you, Eden,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.712
you're insignificant to me.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.214
Fine.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.801
You do your thing, and I'll do my thing.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.263
And I'll be sure to tell Kinsey
that you say "hi"

09:16.097 --> 09:19.892
right before I snap her neck.

09:22.311 --> 09:25.731
You might wanna think twice
about whether or not you wanna do that.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.822
Run along.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.867
I have real work to do.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.035
Mm-hmm.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.569
Are we gonna be able to pull this off?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.448
If he's already turned a bunch of people…

10:16.741 --> 10:18.117
What choice do we have?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.249
Shit. I didn't do anything.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.210
Pull over.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.268
It's Mutuku.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.733
Hey, Detective Mutuku.

10:51.525 --> 10:55.321
Tyler and Kinsey Locke.
Been a while. How've you been?

10:56.322 --> 10:59.158
We're fine. Did I…
Did I do something wrong?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.078
Well, that depends.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.707
Do you really think you can stop him?

11:08.459 --> 11:09.627
Oh my God.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.671
-He's waiting for you.
-Drive!

11:29.730 --> 11:31.691
Where should
we put the guns, Captain?

11:31.774 --> 11:35.403
-In the wagon. Gunpowder too.
-Aye, Captain.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.949
Careful with that.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.036
No!

11:44.120 --> 11:46.872
-Be careful with that. It's powder.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.790
More rifles.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.584
Stow that away.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.877
That's the lot of it, sir.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.755
Good, just one more thing to do.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.008
No.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.220
-What's he doing? Peter, what's he doing?
-No! No!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.264
-Have you no mercy!

12:03.347 --> 12:04.181
Good.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.393
-I think I'll start with this one.
-No! No!

12:07.476 --> 12:10.187
-No! No!
-No!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.105
No!

12:14.358 --> 12:15.693
Take cover!

12:18.195 --> 12:19.029
Surround them!

12:21.699 --> 12:22.575
Find cover!

12:22.658 --> 12:23.826
Return fire!

12:24.452 --> 12:26.036
All redcoats, move off the line!

12:28.789 --> 12:31.250
Fall back! To the horses! Go!

12:31.333 --> 12:33.753
Move! Move! Fall back! Man down!

12:37.256 --> 12:38.299
Benjamin!

12:39.800 --> 12:41.510
-Well done, son.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.636
Let's go!

12:43.345 --> 12:44.346
Give me your knife.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.015
Behind the bales!

12:46.098 --> 12:47.892
Captain, let's go!

12:51.395 --> 12:52.605
Push harder.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.231
-You can do it.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.778
-You can do it!

12:58.861 --> 13:00.529
-Yah!

13:00.613 --> 13:03.199
-Or perhaps…

13:05.034 --> 13:05.910
you cannot.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.958
And worst of all,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.712
your death will mean nothing.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.427
Captain! There's too many! We need to go!

13:23.511 --> 13:26.263
-Got them on the run!
-Cover the captain.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.016
Peter, no! Peter!

13:30.142 --> 13:31.977
-They're getting away!
-Retreat!

13:37.316 --> 13:39.068
-Father.
-I'm sorry.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.538
Get after them!

13:50.621 --> 13:51.914
We're loaded!

13:52.498 --> 13:54.166
They're heading for the main trail!

14:04.260 --> 14:06.512
-Whoa. Whoa.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.767
-Yah!

14:46.635 --> 14:48.429
We'll get above the tide line,

14:49.471 --> 14:52.641
hide out till they finish their search.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.760
Yah! Yah!

15:30.095 --> 15:31.764
They must've come this way.

15:38.062 --> 15:38.896
Spread out.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.609
You see anything?

15:44.443 --> 15:45.819
Fresh heel prints.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.447
They must be this way. Look.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.366
They can't be far.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.079
Where to now?

15:55.579 --> 15:57.456
-Quiet.
-What is that?

16:27.444 --> 16:29.238
What in God's name?

16:39.415 --> 16:40.708
What is this?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.307
They must have gone this way.

16:57.391 --> 16:58.267
Captain.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.062
-They found us.
-Then we'll make our stand here.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.579
What are we witnessing?

17:29.465 --> 17:31.216
Careful, they're here! Duck!

17:43.228 --> 17:45.355
Howe! Get down!

18:11.924 --> 18:13.759
-Yah!

19:46.810 --> 19:48.145
I'm heading to school.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.940
Oh my God.
I didn't realize how late it was.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.444
-You want me to make you breakfast?
-I had cereal.

19:57.237 --> 19:58.405
What's all this?

19:58.488 --> 20:02.534
Oh, uh, I'm going through
the Keyhouse ledger that Nina gave me,

20:03.410 --> 20:05.662
cross-referencing some things on this map,

20:05.746 --> 20:08.790
trying to understand where things were,
what's still around…

20:08.874 --> 20:10.834
Oh, nerd stuff.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.878
Incredible nerd stuff.

20:14.171 --> 20:15.714
-Love you.
-Love you too.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.341
Have a good day at school.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.433
Bye!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.060
Bye!

20:32.606 --> 20:33.732
So Gabe is Dodge?

20:33.815 --> 20:36.026
Eden being a demon
really is not that surprising.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.197
Try and take this from me.

20:41.114 --> 20:43.242
Demons can't take keys from Lockes.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.757
I can't!

21:00.842 --> 21:02.177
JK. Yoink!

21:02.761 --> 21:03.679
Really?

21:20.821 --> 21:23.323
I knew I wasn't a demon,
but I'm still relieved.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.704
Okay, now that I know
that you're all still you,

21:28.787 --> 21:31.540
we have to find Gabe
and get his Demon Key away from him

21:31.623 --> 21:33.458
before he turns anyone else.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.876
He's already got Javi.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.586
What if a demon comes after us?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.841
You have to take them out.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.759
As in "take them out"?

21:43.844 --> 21:44.678
Pretty much.

21:44.761 --> 21:45.679
But…

21:46.596 --> 21:47.639
What if we know them?

21:47.723 --> 21:50.267
If Gabe turned them,
you don't know them anymore,

21:50.767 --> 21:52.936
and you do not wanna end up like them.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.272
Grab the heaviest thing you can.
Swing it hard.

21:55.355 --> 21:58.150
Okay, this is getting Romero as hell.

21:58.650 --> 22:01.486
Wait, I feel like I've been
training my whole life for this.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.407
I mean, but this is real life.
Not a movie.

22:05.490 --> 22:09.244
This is very real. And these demons
are supernaturally strong.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.454
But they're not invincible.

22:10.537 --> 22:13.832
Wait. So, I mean, if we kill Gabe,
do the rest of them die too?

22:13.915 --> 22:15.375
They're not vampires, Doug.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.711
I understand, but maybe
the same principles apply.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.256
They have to be killed one by one,
and Gabe's an echo.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.841
He can't be killed by force.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.093
Great. So what are we supposed
to do about him?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.263
Let me know if you see him,
but stay far away from him.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.765
Okay, that's a reasonable plan.

22:29.848 --> 22:34.061
If anyone sees Gabe or Eden
or Javi or anything weird,

22:34.144 --> 22:36.938
call me, text me immediately.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.398
All right, let's do this.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.528
Man, I really liked Javi.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.613
Me too.

22:44.696 --> 22:47.282
-Until he tried to kill my family.
-Fair point.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.330
-Morning.
-Morning.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.123
What you got there?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.334
I, uh…

22:58.919 --> 23:02.005
found this weird key in my house.
You wanna… You wanna see it?

23:04.966 --> 23:06.593
Pretty cool.

23:09.971 --> 23:11.640
What's it open?

23:12.265 --> 23:14.309
Maybe someday we'll find out.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.189
Well, I'm gonna stop for coffee on the way
to class. You guys want anything?

23:20.190 --> 23:21.608
-Nah, I'm good.
-Okay.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.533
Can you help me
keep an eye on her today? She, um…

23:30.450 --> 23:32.160
She can't understand any of this.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.328
Of course.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.373
Yo, Jackie! Wait up!

23:46.299 --> 23:47.551
Everything all right?

23:47.634 --> 23:50.762
So far.
No sign of Gabe, but, um…

23:51.596 --> 23:52.681
…he got to Mutuku.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.433
-What?
-Yeah.

23:56.351 --> 23:58.395
Mom still thinks Mutuku's her friend.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.065
If you see him, keep her away.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.046
Phones away.

24:32.095 --> 24:33.013
Hey.

24:35.682 --> 24:36.808
Thanks.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.187
So what happens now?

24:42.814 --> 24:44.941
Tyler and Kinsey
are working on it.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.119
-Hey!
-You can have it back at recess.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.246
Give it back now!

24:58.330 --> 25:00.749
Excuse me? Do you wanna take it up
with the principal?

25:00.832 --> 25:03.627
-No. Don't say anything else.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.546
I'm sorry.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.301
Okay. Everyone,
take out your math worksheets.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.150
"Captain Frederick Gideon

25:28.318 --> 25:31.071
was apprehended by Captain Crais
and his men

25:31.154 --> 25:34.282
after an intense skirmish
in a nearby sea cave."

25:35.033 --> 25:38.203
I've opened a gateway
between the two worlds.

25:38.787 --> 25:43.333
A portal to the beyond
that mere mortals cannot comprehend.

25:44.334 --> 25:47.837
While my fate is likely sealed,

25:48.797 --> 25:50.423
I implore you,

25:51.132 --> 25:52.717
find this place

25:52.801 --> 25:55.971
and let the staggering power
of the other realm

25:56.054 --> 25:59.432
wash over this flawed world.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.668
Frederick Gideon,

26:26.751 --> 26:30.130
for your multitude of crimes
of which you were found guilty,

26:30.213 --> 26:33.466
the people of Massachusetts Bay Colony
have sentenced you to death.

26:34.050 --> 26:36.469
You were a monster
before you went into that cave.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.680
I don't have a word for what you are now.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.684
Well, I am only the beginning, boy.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.520
Others from my world will follow,

26:45.604 --> 26:47.314
then rip your world apart!

26:47.397 --> 26:49.274
-Enough! Drop him.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.989
-Don't look.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.588
"Captain Gideon,

27:11.671 --> 27:14.090
guilty of crimes including assault,

27:14.174 --> 27:15.800
theft, arson,

27:16.301 --> 27:17.886
and the murder of Peter Locke."

27:42.285 --> 27:44.204
Ready for the first coat, boss?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.041
Just about.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.758
Are you okay?

27:58.134 --> 27:59.344
I… I'm just

28:00.720 --> 28:03.014
in a weird place right now.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.561
Things with Josh went south,

28:09.646 --> 28:12.357
and, uh, the kids are pulling away.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.068
I don't think they mean to.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.530
I just know how this goes.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.283
It's a cycle with me.

28:23.368 --> 28:24.411
I feel…

28:26.705 --> 28:28.998
disconnected and… and lonely,

28:30.166 --> 28:32.293
and it just drives me
to wanna take a drink.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.964
What can I do to help?

28:36.047 --> 28:39.050
It's good for me
to focus on something else.

28:39.134 --> 28:42.387
So, uh, yeah,
let's get back to it.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.098
I'll… I'll grab the rollers.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.318
Oh my God!

29:05.869 --> 29:06.703
Hey.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.788
Scot? We just saw Javi.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.791
He's headed through the courtyard
towards the Reynolds building.

29:14.335 --> 29:16.921
-Yeah, I got him. I'll tell Kinsey.
-Okay.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.635
Hey.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.637
He's going
to the Reynolds building.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.389
Headed there now.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.725
What's wrong?

29:29.726 --> 29:32.061
What if something bad happened
to one of us?

29:32.562 --> 29:36.608
My mom can't remember magic,
so she'd blame herself.

29:37.817 --> 29:38.943
It's not fair.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.906
Mrs. Lafferty, you said
I could have my phone back at recess.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.743
No more texting during class, Bode.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.795
Cover for me, okay?

29:57.837 --> 30:00.423
Cover for you? What are you doing?

30:08.264 --> 30:10.475
Javi's on campus. I gotta go.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.602
-Anything I can do?
-Uh…

30:13.561 --> 30:14.604
Stay with her.

30:39.879 --> 30:42.632
Uh… Oh God.
Uh, what do I do? What do I do?

30:42.715 --> 30:43.633
Um…

30:44.300 --> 30:45.134
Okay.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.596
All right, a-hole. Let's do this.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.360
Yeah! You don't want
any part of me, do ya?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.031
Knew those Krav Maga classes
would pay off!

31:17.083 --> 31:19.544
-Are you okay?
-Better now. Whoa, look out!

31:30.805 --> 31:31.931
No!

31:32.015 --> 31:33.725
-Get off me!
-Let her go!

31:36.853 --> 31:37.729
Let's go.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.857
-No!

32:00.001 --> 32:02.003
-Hey, Kins.
-What do you want from me?

32:03.087 --> 32:04.130
Isn't that obvious?

32:06.549 --> 32:07.884
I want you to join me.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.035
Then just get it over with!

32:35.078 --> 32:36.496
No, I want you to choose it.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.541
How could you think
that I would ever choose to be one of you?

32:42.210 --> 32:44.504
It would be so much better
for you to want it.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.090
That will never happen.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.680
Let her go!

32:54.472 --> 32:55.515
Let her go, and…

32:57.308 --> 32:58.726
you can turn me instead.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.188
-Sure, we can turn you next.
-No.

33:02.271 --> 33:04.315
-No! No!
-It's okay.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.400
No! No!

33:06.859 --> 33:08.778
It's not really a negotiation.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.115
Leave him alone! Get off me!

33:12.198 --> 33:14.200
No!

33:14.283 --> 33:15.493
Welcome to the dark side.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.577
No!

33:16.661 --> 33:18.121
No!

33:18.204 --> 33:20.081
No!

33:23.668 --> 33:26.671
-False alarm!

33:31.300 --> 33:32.468
-Run!
-Running!

33:43.771 --> 33:45.565
Bode! What are you doing here?

33:45.648 --> 33:48.526
Uh, I saw that you guys were in trouble,
so I pulled the fire alarm.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.862
-That was you?
-Yeah.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.074
Where's Javi?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.618
With Gabe and some minions.
They're all over the place.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.078
We gotta get out of here.

33:59.162 --> 34:02.999
No, I can't just leave Jackie here.
I'll go get her. I'll meet you at home.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.501
No, no, no. Come on. We gotta go.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.253
Okay, come on.

34:12.216 --> 34:15.720
-All right, what's going on?
-I don't even know where to begin.

34:18.347 --> 34:19.265
Tyler?

34:26.647 --> 34:27.690
Afraid not.

34:29.942 --> 34:31.652
We should check on the kids.

34:36.365 --> 34:40.453
Kinsey just sent a text. Apparently,
it's some sort of prank.

34:40.536 --> 34:41.662
Oh, okay.

34:49.337 --> 34:52.632
I think it's a pretty good excuse
to call it a day, don't you?

34:53.424 --> 34:55.760
-Should we try to find the kids first?
-Uh, no.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.845
She said that
they're gonna meet us at home.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.846
Okay.

35:12.026 --> 35:13.027
Jackie!

35:14.570 --> 35:15.404
Logan!

35:15.488 --> 35:17.532
-Hey!

35:17.615 --> 35:18.533
Hey!

35:19.534 --> 35:21.119
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.876
Clearly, I'm missing something
because you and Logan are acting weird.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.337
Can we please get out of here?

35:32.839 --> 35:33.756
Sure, just, uh…

35:37.301 --> 35:38.386
Can you do me a favor?

35:39.470 --> 35:40.304
Just, uh…

35:42.390 --> 35:43.850
take this key out of my hand.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.978
You already showed me that this morning.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.730
Yeah, just… just take it,
and then we can go.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.569
I don't know what's going on with you,
but you're kind of freaking me out.

35:54.652 --> 35:57.196
Jackie, take the key.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.497
Sorry, lover.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.541
I can't do that.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.586
No.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.966
Tyler, this is gonna happen to you too.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.051
You need to accept that.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.345
Trust me.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.473
It'll be so much easier
if you don't fight this.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.894
And think of how happy we'll be together.

36:34.901 --> 36:35.735
Ty!

36:36.235 --> 36:39.697
Don't listen to her, man.
He turned her into a psycho, demon chick.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.664
Let's get outta here!

36:57.506 --> 36:59.467
I've read
about strange phenomena,

37:00.092 --> 37:01.510
but nothing like this.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.139
We have to find some way to contain it.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.767
We cannot do it through normal means.

37:08.768 --> 37:09.936
It scares me.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.190
Yet I'm drawn to it.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.944
-Careful!

37:32.333 --> 37:35.086
This is what Gideon and one of his men
were struck by.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.801
Do you hear that?

37:42.510 --> 37:43.552
The whispering?

37:44.637 --> 37:45.513
No.

37:49.517 --> 37:53.813
This strange metal is whispering to me.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.357
-What is it saying?
-I don't know.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.401
But it's calling to me.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.083
Late night?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.962
Eden, what are you doing here?
It's past curfew.

38:18.546 --> 38:22.300
You know, I had a feeling
there was something different about you.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.804
You got way too pissed
when someone stole your artifact.

38:30.599 --> 38:34.312
Okay, I'm going home now,
and you should do the same.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.731
But you're so close
to finding out the answer

38:36.814 --> 38:39.066
of where that little metal lump came from.

38:40.151 --> 38:41.319
So close to

38:42.445 --> 38:43.362
this.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.407
This is what you're looking for, right?

38:46.907 --> 38:47.908
This portal?

38:47.992 --> 38:51.120
What could you possibly know about this?

38:51.203 --> 38:53.080
Well, for starters,

38:53.706 --> 38:56.959
I know that the portal is in a sea cave,

38:57.543 --> 39:00.296
and I know where the sea cave is located.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.591
Okay, where is it?

39:04.175 --> 39:05.426
I could take you there.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.930
But first, I need you
to do something for me.

39:10.431 --> 39:12.767
Something that will benefit
both of us, actually.

39:14.143 --> 39:14.977
What?

39:16.228 --> 39:17.271
Your portal,

39:18.731 --> 39:20.399
it's behind a locked door.

39:22.568 --> 39:27.198
I need you to get me the key
that opens it.

39:33.662 --> 39:35.915
Just stay there. I'll keep you posted.

39:38.459 --> 39:41.253
The Savinis are all camped out at Doug's.
They're safe.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.423
Hey, Tyler.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.301
-I need your help.
-What's the matter?

39:48.677 --> 39:49.845
Jackie's been turned.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.693
Gabe got to her.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.946
Ty, I'm so sorry.

40:07.029 --> 40:09.782
-No, no, we can fix this. We can save her.
-How?

40:10.658 --> 40:14.453
The Demon Key, it basically locks a demon
to someone's soul, right?

40:14.537 --> 40:16.205
But a key turns both ways.

40:16.288 --> 40:20.084
So we just need to make a new key
that unlocks a demon from a soul.

40:20.167 --> 40:21.919
You need Whispering Iron to make a key.

40:22.002 --> 40:26.424
Dad loved hiding things
around the house, you know?

40:26.507 --> 40:28.467
Little secret surprises for us to find.

40:28.551 --> 40:32.346
Ty, if he had a "break glass in case
of emergency" stash of Whispering Iron,

40:32.888 --> 40:34.223
I never knew about it.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.475
Say that again.

40:37.726 --> 40:42.064
"Break glass in case of emergency" stash
of Whispering Iron?

40:57.079 --> 40:59.415
Rendell used to wear this all the time.

41:01.333 --> 41:02.418
Seriously, who…

41:03.752 --> 41:06.464
who puts a fishing lure on a baseball cap?

41:07.923 --> 41:09.341
He said he had it there just

41:09.425 --> 41:10.509
in case of emergency.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.394
-What are you doing?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.064
In case of emergency.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.785
-Whoa.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.169
What's wrong?

41:46.587 --> 41:47.713
I don't hear whispering.

41:48.672 --> 41:49.882
You can't hear that?

41:51.383 --> 41:52.510
-Uh-uh.
-No.

41:53.844 --> 41:55.012
Nobody else can?

41:56.805 --> 41:58.390
Making a key is a conversation

41:58.474 --> 42:00.559
between the Whispering Iron
and the key maker.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.604
I heard whispering
when I made the Memory Key

42:03.687 --> 42:06.232
and the other night with Gabe,
but this one…

42:08.359 --> 42:09.860
it's not speaking to me.

42:10.819 --> 42:12.071
It's speaking to you.

42:17.493 --> 42:19.036
What good will a door do?

42:19.662 --> 42:21.288
It will turn evil against itself

42:21.372 --> 42:24.208
by making both lock and key
from this Whispering Iron.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.876
The door will work.

42:27.169 --> 42:28.254
I know it in my heart.

42:43.644 --> 42:44.478
No luck?

42:45.062 --> 42:47.439
I'm missing some element. It's…

42:49.108 --> 42:53.320
In my reading of the rituals of alchemy,
you must have two things.

42:53.404 --> 42:56.031
Intention and sacrifice,

42:56.574 --> 42:59.326
to bind the spell-caster, you,

42:59.410 --> 43:02.162
to the magic source, the Whispering Iron.

43:04.540 --> 43:06.667
What kind of sacrifice?

44:10.314 --> 44:12.566
If only
Father were here to see it.

44:27.289 --> 44:29.458
I wonder what else
we can craft with these.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.171
This is the only shot we get at this.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.258
I'll talk you through every step.

45:25.848 --> 45:26.974
Let's get to work.
