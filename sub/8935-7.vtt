WEBVTT

00:02.268 --> 00:03.837
This is
the Evergreen Forest.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.172
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.643
That is until Bert
Raccoon wakes up!

00:10.643 --> 00:11.478
Yahoo!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.683
Yehaww!

00:16.683 --> 00:18.251
Yipe!

00:18.251 --> 00:22.422
Yahoo!

00:22.422 --> 00:23.656
Yeah!

00:23.656 --> 00:25.792
Luckily,
he has some good friends

00:25.792 --> 00:26.960
to help him out.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.703
Life would be simple in
the forest except for...

00:38.104 --> 00:39.773
Cyril Sneer.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.712
And his life would be
simple except for...

00:46.846 --> 00:46.980
c)

01:02.362 --> 01:04.297
Summer draws to a close

01:04.297 --> 01:07.967
and autumn works its magic
on the Evergreen Forest.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.303
The nights are cooler
and the days are shorter,

01:10.303 --> 01:13.039
but with the Fall
Fair coming up fast,

01:13.039 --> 01:14.707
shorter days are one thing

01:14.707 --> 01:17.544
Bert Raccoon definitely
doesn't need.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.379
Wait'll we set off
these little beauties

01:19.379 --> 01:20.880
at the fair tonight.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.217
You know, in all
modesty, Mr. Willow,

01:24.217 --> 01:26.386
Lady Baden-Baden knew
what she was doing

01:26.386 --> 01:29.189
when she put me in
charge of fireworks.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.829
Make sure you read the
safety manual first, Bert.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.532
I sure hope I can
make it to the fair.

01:39.532 --> 01:41.935
I've got a lot of stacking
and pricing to do.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.605
Well, you're not gonna
miss my fireworks display

01:45.605 --> 01:46.906
if I can help it.

01:46.906 --> 01:47.874
Ha!

01:47.874 --> 01:51.077
Bert Raccoon to the rescue!

01:51.077 --> 01:54.581
Well, that's right
nice of ya, Bert.

01:54.581 --> 01:57.350
Preserving jars, eh,
Schaeffer?

01:57.350 --> 02:00.120
Planning on winning the
blue ribbon this year?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.355
Do ya think my blueberry
preserves will do the trick?

02:02.355 --> 02:04.457
They work great
with peanut butter.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.560
By the way, Bert, where did
you leave the blueberries?

02:07.560 --> 02:09.562
I didn't see them in the fridge.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.832
Oh, well, the thing
is Schaeffer,

02:12.832 --> 02:15.135
I haven't actually
picked them yet.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.872
Yeah, but I'll have buckets
of blueberries for ya

02:18.872 --> 02:20.106
this afternoon.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.976
Okay,
Bert. Thanks. See ya.

02:22.976 --> 02:23.810
Hi Schaeffer.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.644
Hi Bentley.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.912
Hi Mr. Willow.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.181
I'd like a binder and
a geometry set please.

02:28.181 --> 02:29.682
Hiya Bentley.

02:29.682 --> 02:32.719
And oh yeah, a box of
those colored paper clips.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.921
Ah, Bentley?

02:34.921 --> 02:38.124
Gee, that sounds
like Bert Raccoon.

02:38.124 --> 02:41.828
Nah, couldn't be, he's supposed
to be out on his raft today

02:41.828 --> 02:43.663
with his good friend Bentley.

02:43.663 --> 02:44.597
Oh.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.566
Here's your stuff, Bentley.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.434
Thanks Mr. Willow.

02:48.434 --> 02:51.037
Yep, good old Bert and
Bentley are probably out

02:51.037 --> 02:52.705
on Jack Pine Island right now.

02:53.706 --> 02:54.974
Hey! Hey, Bentley! Wait!

02:56.409 --> 02:58.111
Hey! What about the?

03:03.016 --> 03:07.554
Oh great, just great.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.359
It's a sure-fire winner.

03:13.359 --> 03:15.862
Sneer's Old-Time Preserves.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.298
Everybody wants to
buy homemade goodness.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.499
Yes.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.035
We'd use only the
freshest cut rate fruit.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.871
Oh, it's a divine
concept, Cyl.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.639
Darn tootin' right it is.

03:26.639 --> 03:30.009
And the winning recipe of the
Fall Fair Preserves Contest

03:30.009 --> 03:33.246
will have the honor of
going into business with me.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.315
Of course I'll wanna
be in on the judging.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.218
I see absolutely
no problem there.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.520
Welcome aboard.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.288
It's great to be aboard.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.525
Whoops.

03:45.525 --> 03:46.359
Hang on.

03:47.193 --> 03:49.229
Pigs! More tea!

03:50.463 --> 03:52.899
And the doorbell, you
flat-nosed failures!

03:52.899 --> 03:54.367
Get the doorbell!

03:54.367 --> 03:55.935
Ahem.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.637
I'll be right back.

04:06.646 --> 04:10.283
Package for the
pigs. What a treat.

04:10.283 --> 04:12.785
Hey, with this
recipe for preserves,

04:12.785 --> 04:15.154
we're gonna take that
blue ribbon at the fair

04:15.154 --> 04:17.156
no problem.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.760
The instructions say to boil
fruit in the pressure cooker

04:20.760 --> 04:23.863
at 10 pounds for 20 minutes.

04:25.398 --> 04:29.235
So I figure if we make it
200 pounds for one minute,

04:30.136 --> 04:32.805
it'll be twice as good.

04:32.805 --> 04:36.509
You know, your math's getting
better every day, Lloyd.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.910
Boy, first prize.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.014
A week in the Porkanos.

04:41.014 --> 04:46.019
And a major cash prize
just begging to be spent.

04:47.186 --> 04:48.821
Oh! We
just have to win!

04:50.023 --> 04:52.692
I hate to think what
I'll have to resort to

04:52.692 --> 04:57.096
if you three thick heads
ignore that intercom again.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.966
I want tea and I want it!

05:01.401 --> 05:03.102
Oh! No!

05:03.102 --> 05:04.203
Turn it off!

05:10.310 --> 05:13.413
Oh, Cyl. Oh, what
a novel tea trolley.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.752
Darn!

05:19.752 --> 05:21.387
Things would be going a lot
faster if Bert had shown up

05:21.387 --> 05:23.056
like he said he would.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.659
Hi guys. Have
you seen Bentley?

05:26.659 --> 05:27.894
Not lately.

05:27.894 --> 05:30.129
Something wrong, Bert?

05:30.129 --> 05:31.064
Nah.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.598
Glad you could make it, Bert.

05:32.598 --> 05:33.833
Now if you're quite ready

05:33.833 --> 05:35.935
you can start on that
section over there.

05:35.935 --> 05:36.969
Oh!

05:36.969 --> 05:39.505
No problem, Ralphie boy.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.340
Bentley!

05:40.340 --> 05:41.874
Hey, Bentley! Wait up!

05:41.874 --> 05:43.776
Now just hold on, Bert.

05:43.776 --> 05:45.645
You promised you'd
help with the roof.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.380
Huh? Yeah, I did.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.015
Consider it done.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.583
Oh, I gotta talk to Bentley

05:50.583 --> 05:52.418
and then I gotta do
the fireworks thing.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.887
And then...

05:54.887 --> 05:57.323
I'll see ya later
at the fairgrounds.

05:57.323 --> 05:58.157
Hey, Bentley!

05:59.058 --> 06:01.527
Bentley wait up, little buddy!

06:03.396 --> 06:06.699
Say who was that
masked man anyway?

06:06.699 --> 06:11.137
Hi guys. How's the
weather up there?

06:12.238 --> 06:14.774
No, seriously,
have you seen Bert?

06:16.576 --> 06:18.878
Oh, we were supposed
to go to see

06:18.878 --> 06:21.013
a nature film at the museum.

06:21.013 --> 06:22.648
What's on this
week anyway, Cedric?

06:22.648 --> 06:26.953
"The Furbish Lousewort:
A Species In Trouble,"

06:26.953 --> 06:30.223
but it's no fun going alone.

06:30.223 --> 06:34.460
Yeah. Yeah, I wouldn't
wanna see it alone either.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.962
But if you are at loose ends,

06:35.962 --> 06:39.399
there's a roof up here and
a huge pile of shingles.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.668
If you three were
buildings, you'd be condemned.

06:42.668 --> 06:45.271
I want this kitchen
rebuilt perfectly

06:45.271 --> 06:47.607
and it's coming out
of your salary now!

06:47.607 --> 06:49.008
Yes, Boss.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.811
Oh great!

06:51.811 --> 06:53.780
Where are we supposed
to get the cash

06:53.780 --> 06:55.782
for a major renovation?

06:55.782 --> 06:59.252
Hey, the day's
not a total washout.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.355
We got a package from Mom.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.823
Oh!

07:03.823 --> 07:08.494
Dear boys, knowing how
much you love my preserves,

07:08.494 --> 07:09.328
enjoy these.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.434
Another surprise
is arriving soon.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.568
Oh!

07:15.568 --> 07:18.704
Love, Mom.

07:18.704 --> 07:23.509
You know, Mom makes the best
preserves in the universe.

07:25.478 --> 07:26.479
Doesn't she?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.081
Guys!

07:29.081 --> 07:32.518
Take a gander at the prize
winning jar of preserves

07:32.518 --> 07:34.520
in this year's Fall Fair!

07:35.588 --> 07:37.457
What are you
talking about, Lloyd?

07:37.457 --> 07:41.661
The cash prize alone
will pay for this mess

07:41.661 --> 07:45.531
and we'll still get a
trip to the Porkanos.

07:45.531 --> 07:47.166
Get the picture?

07:47.166 --> 07:49.535
Hey, you're not gonna enter

07:49.535 --> 07:52.071
Mom's preserves under our name.

07:53.706 --> 07:54.540
Are you?

07:56.375 --> 07:57.210
Oh.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.114
And here's lunch. Peanut
butter sandwiches supremo!

08:03.616 --> 08:06.519
Ah, thanks for giving me
another chance, Bentley.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.855
Bert, I wish you'd
stop apologizing.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.957
We all forget stuff
once in a while.

08:10.957 --> 08:15.595
Well, in that case, haul
the anchor, me buckle!

08:15.595 --> 08:20.233
We sail with the tide for
Jack Pine Isle!

08:20.233 --> 08:21.133
Hey Bert!

08:22.034 --> 08:23.402
Oh my gosh. The blueberries.

08:23.402 --> 08:26.439
Ah, ah, just hang on
a sec, little buddy.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.741
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Two. Two seconds.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.644
Look Bert, if you just
tell me where I can find

08:31.644 --> 08:33.846
this super duper patch of yours,

08:33.846 --> 08:36.015
I'll get the blueberries myself.

08:36.015 --> 08:40.286
Gee, Schaeffer, you'd never
find it in a million years.

08:40.286 --> 08:42.121
I'll have to show
you where it is.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.658
I'll be back in a couple
of minutes, little buddy.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.159
Bert, I'm drifting out!

08:47.159 --> 08:48.794
That's okay, Bentley.

08:48.794 --> 08:50.429
Just bring her around
and tie her up.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.532
Ah, gee, I'm sorry, Schaeffer.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.635
Like I said, I was
gonna pick them, honest.

08:55.635 --> 08:57.837
Well, just wait till
you see this patch.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.338
Hey Bert! Come back!

08:59.338 --> 09:01.574
I don't know how to
sail this stupid thing.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.408
Bert!

09:03.943 --> 09:04.777
Bert!

09:09.849 --> 09:11.350
Isn't it exciting?

09:11.350 --> 09:14.620
Cyril Sneer will manufacture
the winning recipe.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.155
Oh, wouldn't that be perfect?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.795
The boss producing our preserves.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.330
Next!

09:24.330 --> 09:26.299
Oh, hello boys!

09:26.299 --> 09:30.369
I didn't know you
were interested in
putting up preserves.

09:30.369 --> 09:35.374
Oh, we're interested in
anything that has a cash prize.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.644
And a trip to the Porkanos.

09:38.644 --> 09:41.581
This is our entry.
We made it ourselves.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.483
Without any help
at all from Mom.

09:44.483 --> 09:47.753
Ah, we call it Three
Porkers Preserves.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.757
How very novel.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.459
♪ And add another left ♪

09:53.459 --> 09:54.393
♪ And a do-see-do ♪

09:54.393 --> 09:57.930
Oh honey! I need you.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.198
Oh sweetness!

10:00.132 --> 10:02.301
I need you too.

10:02.301 --> 10:07.306
Uh, no, no, my dearest.
I need y'all outside.

10:08.708 --> 10:12.211
We have five square dance
callers here for an audition.

10:12.211 --> 10:14.947
But I simply can't
deal with it now.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.016
I'm absolutely inundated!

10:18.184 --> 10:21.253
Oh honey bun,
we need more help.

10:21.253 --> 10:24.624
I can't understand why
Bert hasn't shown up.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.760
Ah, perhaps we
might be of service.

10:27.760 --> 10:32.398
Ooh! You boys are
full of surprises today.

10:32.398 --> 10:36.335
Oh, and speaking of which,
I have one for you later on.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.539
Now remember, all
you have to do is,

10:41.641 --> 10:44.543
well, just register them.

10:44.543 --> 10:48.547
This where we cut
down the competition.

10:48.547 --> 10:49.515
Attention!

10:50.750 --> 10:54.220
It seems not all of you
are aware of the rules.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.622
Ah, rule number one,

10:56.622 --> 11:01.394
all those with red labels
on their jars, hands up.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.563
You're disqualified.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.032
Now don't get ugly.

11:06.032 --> 11:08.334
We're just doing our jobs.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.069
Now, rule number two.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.539
Ah, who's wearing green socks?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.208
I'm telling you, Schaeffer,

11:16.208 --> 11:18.778
this fireworks
display I'm working on

11:18.778 --> 11:21.213
it's gonna make
Evergreen Forest history.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.249
Sounds like a big project.

11:23.249 --> 11:24.884
Shouldn't you be down
there working on it?

11:24.884 --> 11:26.819
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

11:26.819 --> 11:29.088
I'll put these in the kitchen.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.723
Hi Schaeffer.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.625
I'll have the blue
plate special.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.427
Coming right up.

11:37.763 --> 11:38.597
Ah, Mr. Willow.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.066
Ah, the store, yeah.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.835
I was gonna help some more.

11:42.835 --> 11:46.005
Great Bert. I
sure could use it.

11:46.005 --> 11:47.573
Here we go, Mr. Willow.

11:47.573 --> 11:49.875
One peanut butter
sandwich and a milk.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.444
Peanut butter sandwich!

11:51.444 --> 11:53.179
Oh no! Bentley!

11:53.179 --> 11:55.247
Bert, hold on!

11:56.582 --> 11:59.385
I don't know what's
got into him today.

11:59.385 --> 12:02.488
Tell you what, I'll help
you with your inventory

12:02.488 --> 12:05.057
if you'll help me
with my preserves.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.560
The best
offer I've had all day.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.097
Hey Bentley, how about
this antique fire engine?

12:11.097 --> 12:12.198
Isn't she a beaut?

12:14.133 --> 12:18.838
Ah, come on Bentley.
I said I was sorry.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.307
Oh, so there you are.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.908
Ah, Lady Baden-Baden.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.412
Ah, the preserves
registration, right?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.447
Nevermind. It's done.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.149
I just hope you've looked after

12:30.149 --> 12:33.018
the fireworks display satisfactorily.

12:33.886 --> 12:35.354
Whew!

12:35.354 --> 12:38.057
Mr. Willow, I was just
heading over to your store.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.625
It's all taken care of, Bert.

12:39.625 --> 12:40.860
Oh.

12:40.860 --> 12:44.230
Ah, how about your
blueberry preserves?

12:44.230 --> 12:45.898
Nope, we did that too.

12:45.898 --> 12:46.699
Oh.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.903
Cedric, old buddy! Hey, Hey!

12:50.903 --> 12:55.908
Oh, no. Weren't we supposed
to go to a movie or something?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.345
Gee, that was hours ago, Bert.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.746
Hi gang! What's up?

13:00.746 --> 13:02.448
The roof's up, Bert.

13:02.448 --> 13:06.585
Oh yes. I was just gonna
check back, but I guess-

13:06.585 --> 13:08.554
It's just as well
you didn't, Bert.

13:08.554 --> 13:11.056
We had to redo your
section of the roof.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.892
It was a complete mess.

13:12.892 --> 13:16.061
We'd still be up there if
Cedric hadn't pitched into help.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.464
So

13:18.464 --> 13:20.900
nobody needs any help?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.002
Not from you Bert. Thanks.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.774
Ah! Hi Boss.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.511
Your entry, I take it.

13:32.511 --> 13:34.480
Yes Sir, Boss.

13:34.480 --> 13:39.485
And speaking modestly, we're
a shoe-in to win the contest.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.654
I guarantee the judges

13:41.654 --> 13:44.156
have never tasted anything
like our preserves.

13:44.156 --> 13:46.492
Just think, Boss, you and us.

13:46.492 --> 13:49.528
We'll make a great
team, right Boss?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.865
I'd rather team up with
a trio of tax collectors.

13:52.865 --> 13:53.966
Why if you ever-

13:53.966 --> 13:54.800
Oh, hello boys.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.305
Apparently there was
some registration trouble

13:59.305 --> 14:01.040
with a few of the entries,

14:01.040 --> 14:02.908
but it's all sorted out.

14:02.908 --> 14:06.679
And now that
surprise I mentioned.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.215
♪ Hello ♪

14:09.215 --> 14:13.519
To our judge for the
preserves contest, boys.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.154
Surprise!

14:15.154 --> 14:16.889
Mom!

14:16.889 --> 14:18.257
Hello boys.

14:18.257 --> 14:21.627
Lady Baden-Baden invited
me to judge last week.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.496
Gee!

14:24.496 --> 14:27.933
We'll have a grand old
visit when the judging's over.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.201
Won't we, boys?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.135
Oh!

14:30.135 --> 14:32.571
We, we sure will, Mom.

14:32.571 --> 14:33.772
Why don't you fellows

14:33.772 --> 14:37.309
go fetch your mother
and me some cider, hmm?

14:39.645 --> 14:42.514
We're in deep this time, guys.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.782
With Mom judging,

14:43.782 --> 14:46.018
she's sure to recognize
her own preserves!

14:46.018 --> 14:48.754
And we'll be in a pickle.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.155
Oh, what a jam!

15:02.067 --> 15:04.003
Are you going to be
finished on time, Bert?

15:04.003 --> 15:04.937
It's almost dark.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.472
I said I'd run the fireworks

15:06.472 --> 15:09.541
and that's just what I'm doing.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.544
Gee, there sure are a
lot of rules for fireworks.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.180
Look Bentley,
I'm a little busy.

15:15.180 --> 15:18.250
Bert, I'm trying to apologize.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.352
I guess I was a
little hard on you.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.855
Huh! You're darn
right ya were.

15:22.855 --> 15:27.126
I mean, there I am knocking
myself out for everybody

15:27.126 --> 15:28.494
and what do I get?

15:28.494 --> 15:31.030
How about a balloon ride?

15:31.030 --> 15:32.498
What do you mean?

15:32.498 --> 15:35.467
You mean in that balloon?

15:35.467 --> 15:38.771
Ah, yeah. I arranged
it with Mr. DeFazio.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.940
I figured it might
be a good spot

15:40.940 --> 15:42.608
to watch the firework show.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.410
No, no.

15:44.410 --> 15:45.911
I better not, Bentley.

15:45.911 --> 15:48.447
I've still got the
prelaunch check to do.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.215
But Bert, you've gotta come.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.752
I mean, I arranged it for you.

15:53.752 --> 15:58.090
Besides Mr. DeFazio says
I'm not allowed up alone.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.292
But if you can't, you can't.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.462
Hey Bentley, hang on a sec.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.134
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah,
yeah, I get that.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.170
Mm-hmm. There!

16:11.170 --> 16:13.706
Let's hit the sky, partner!

16:15.574 --> 16:17.710
And now our esteemed judges,

16:17.710 --> 16:20.879
Cyril Sneer and Mrs. Pig,

16:20.879 --> 16:22.514
will begin the judging.

16:22.514 --> 16:27.086
May the best preserves prevail.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.354
More to the right.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.722
Oh!

16:29.722 --> 16:32.558
We've gotta get Mom's
preserves back before they win!

16:32.558 --> 16:35.194
Easy. You've got it.

16:35.194 --> 16:36.028
Oh!

16:38.330 --> 16:39.598
Oh!

16:39.598 --> 16:43.535
Oh, you know, I think
he might be on to us.

16:43.535 --> 16:45.270
We need a distraction.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.907
Something to get everybody
out of that tent.

16:48.907 --> 16:51.577
We've got to get
those preserves back.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.748
Oh! This is lovely.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.349
What do you think, Cyril?

16:58.784 --> 17:00.452
Not bad. Not bad.

17:01.487 --> 17:04.423
And finally, our last entry.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.225
Thank you.

17:06.225 --> 17:07.059
Mmm!

17:09.328 --> 17:13.665
Mmm! Great gooseberries!
This stuff's fabulous!

17:14.733 --> 17:17.936
Oh no! They can't win.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.805
They just can't.

17:20.639 --> 17:21.774
Whoops! It slipped.

17:23.242 --> 17:27.146
Oh, wow. Talk about your
front row seats.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.248
Oh, you're a real pal, Bentley.

17:29.248 --> 17:30.716
And don't you forget it.

17:30.716 --> 17:34.086
Oh boy, when you
come up with a distraction,

17:34.086 --> 17:35.654
you don't fool around!

17:35.654 --> 17:38.791
Okay, let's have a countdown.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.825
Oh yes.

17:39.825 --> 17:40.659
999.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.461
998.

17:43.328 --> 17:44.363
997.

17:44.363 --> 17:45.898
Good enough!

17:49.835 --> 17:51.603
Wow!

17:51.603 --> 17:54.907
If this doesn't bring
'em running, nothing will.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.710
Come on, boys. Preserve patrol!

17:58.710 --> 18:02.181
Gee, Lady Baden-Baden hit
the switch a little early.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.515
Ah, who cares?

18:04.450 --> 18:06.518
Wow. Look at that, Bentley.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.987
Oh, I told you it
would be a dandy.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.722
Wow!

18:10.722 --> 18:11.690
It worked!

18:11.690 --> 18:13.826
Oh wow!

18:13.826 --> 18:18.097
Who launched these
fireworks without my say so?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.798
I don't know,
Lady Baden-Baden,

18:19.798 --> 18:22.801
but Bert sure did a
swell job on them.

18:22.801 --> 18:24.503
Oh, look at that.

18:24.503 --> 18:25.537
Wow!

18:28.373 --> 18:29.274
Look out!

18:34.113 --> 18:35.514
Something's gone wrong!

18:35.514 --> 18:36.715
Duck!

18:40.018 --> 18:41.353
Oh no!

18:43.188 --> 18:45.157
Oh, it's not here.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.758
Oh, it's not here!

18:46.758 --> 18:48.594
Bert! Bentley! Jump!

18:50.262 --> 18:51.530
Whoa!

18:51.530 --> 18:53.298
You mean from here?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.733
Wah!

18:54.733 --> 18:55.567
Oh!

18:56.468 --> 18:57.369
Look out!

19:01.473 --> 19:03.108
Oh my. Oh dear.

19:03.108 --> 19:05.010
Oh, it's lost. Oh dear.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.779
Mmm! Cheechy Beans.

19:07.779 --> 19:09.014
I assume there's

19:09.014 --> 19:12.184
an explanation for
all this, boys.

19:17.456 --> 19:21.994
Let's face it. I did a
sloppy job on the fireworks.

19:21.994 --> 19:25.364
I shoulda worked
harder on everything.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.333
You just worked too hard
on too many things, Bert.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.768
Yeah.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.337
And I let all my friends down.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.439
Bert, we are your friends

19:34.439 --> 19:37.109
and that's what makes it
all right to say no to us.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.578
We don't expect
you to be a Superman.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.313
We'll understand.

19:41.313 --> 19:44.049
Gee, thanks guys.

19:44.049 --> 19:47.953
So what about the
ho-down? Coming?

19:47.953 --> 19:49.821
Yeah, sure.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.623
If you think I can handle it.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.725
Oh, Bert.

20:16.615 --> 20:19.017
Sometimes trying
to help out our friends,

20:19.017 --> 20:21.420
we make all sorts of promises

20:21.420 --> 20:24.856
but the best promises of all
are the ones we can keep.

20:27.326 --> 20:28.527
Hey, Schaeffer!

20:28.527 --> 20:30.062
Don't suppose you wanna

20:30.062 --> 20:32.598
put a little of that blueberry
preserve on a slice of bread?

20:32.598 --> 20:35.601
You know, spread
the wealth around?

20:37.135 --> 20:39.137
I'd like to admire it for a
bit, if you don't mind, Bert.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.039
We're off to
the Porkanos, Schaeffer.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.408
Now you sure you
won't change your mind?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.143
After all, it is your prize.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.845
You two enjoy yourselves.

20:46.845 --> 20:50.182
I've got all the holiday
I need running the cafe.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.683
Okay, Bert.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.919
I'm counting on you to
look after the newspaper.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.623
Hey, no problem,
Ralphie boy!

20:57.623 --> 21:00.726
I mean, have I ever
let ya down before?

21:00.726 --> 21:02.361
Ah, don't answer that.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.364
Later, Bert. Later.

21:05.364 --> 21:09.234
It's too bad the boys
can't join us on the picnic,

21:09.234 --> 21:10.636
but it's nice to see

21:10.636 --> 21:12.804
they can be conscientious
about their work.

21:12.804 --> 21:15.807
It's just a matter of
motivating them, my dear.

21:15.807 --> 21:18.243
Shall we?

21:18.243 --> 21:19.611
Last stone!

21:19.611 --> 21:20.679
Slip it in.

21:20.679 --> 21:22.314
Careful.

21:22.314 --> 21:23.649
There!

21:23.649 --> 21:25.617
Ah! Glad
that's over with.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.120
Let's hit the showers!

21:28.120 --> 21:30.889
Uh, where's the door?

21:30.889 --> 21:31.690
Oh dear.

21:33.091 --> 21:36.461
I think there's bricks
where the door used to be.

21:36.461 --> 21:40.432
Get serious, Lloyd!
We're not that stupid!

21:40.432 --> 21:41.266
Are we?

21:44.436 --> 21:46.571
