<i>and the whole family can gather,</i>

07:56.776 --> 07:58.144

07:58.211 --> 07:59.912
<i>So, I'll bring in new windows,</i>

07:59.979 --> 08:02.081
<i>new lighting,</i>

08:02.148 --> 08:04.784
<i>This living room needs</i>

<i>So, after we move</i>

08:06.786 --> 08:08.187

08:08.254 --> 08:10.923

<i>I'll bring in more furniture</i>

08:18.731 --> 08:20.566
<i>favorite family photos.</i>

08:20.633 --> 08:21.801
This is the dining room.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.003
KANDI:
This is where the magic happens.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.671
-Yes, it is. (laughs)
-Eating. (laughs)

08:25.738 --> 08:26.706
-Eating.
-We love that.

08:26.772 --> 08:27.740
But there's only enough for,

08:27.807 --> 08:29.542
like, six people here.

08:29.609 --> 08:31.177
KANDI:
Yeah, well, you know,
we would take turns.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.211
We switch out.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.113
Realistically, some people

08:34.180 --> 08:35.915
would be eating over there,
eating on the left, some people

08:35.982 --> 08:37.750
eating over here, some people
are eating standing up.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.752
NISCHELLE:
The bigger the table
that you can

08:39.819 --> 08:41.087
fit in here, the better.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.755
-Okay, so...
-Mm-hmm.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.190
...that and then maybe, Rob,

08:44.257 --> 08:46.025
what's going on
with these walls?

08:46.092 --> 08:47.560
ROB:
We got to look and see.

08:47.627 --> 08:49.729
-Okay.
-Can you open that wall up?

08:49.795 --> 08:51.297
ROB:
Uh... I might be able to.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.200
That's as close to
an automatic yes that I think

08:54.267 --> 08:55.968
I've ever heard from Rob.
(laughs)

08:56.035 --> 08:57.203
Are you okay?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.105
I'm gonna have to
look in there, okay?

08:59.171 --> 09:01.841
Because if it is a main beam,
then the answer would be no.

09:01.908 --> 09:03.709
So then, if this is gonna spill

09:03.776 --> 09:05.211
into this dining room, and

09:05.278 --> 09:07.713
we can open, I'm just gonna
assume that we can...

09:07.780 --> 09:09.749
-Okay.
-...into the kitchen,

09:09.815 --> 09:12.685
we can make some sort of
island situation where people

09:12.752 --> 09:14.754
can eat at the dining table
and/or the island.

09:14.820 --> 09:15.988

-Okay.

-I do notice one problem
directly behind you.
-What?

09:35.207 --> 09:37.743
ROB:
The electrical panel
should not be in the kitchen.

09:37.810 --> 09:38.844
SABRINA:
Okay.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.646
ROB:
We'll address it.

09:40.713 --> 09:41.914
-SABRINA: If this is
gonna be moved...
-ROB: Right.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.316
that means everything
can be moved.

09:43.382 --> 09:44.617
Well, I think we're
gonna do the windows

09:44.684 --> 09:46.152

09:46.218 --> 09:47.787

10:35.434 --> 10:37.036
They can put

10:37.103 --> 10:38.404
I think we need

-So can we use this space

10:59.992 --> 11:02.828
I feel like if we're opening up
this wall here,

11:02.895 --> 11:05.998
Sabrina, like, would you be
opposed to opening this as well?

11:06.799 --> 11:09.135
She's never opposed

-to making something bigger?
-What are you talking about?

-Okay.
-Like, all down, all open.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.311
-All right.
-The only thing is, like,

11:19.378 --> 11:22.081
check out this back ceiling

11:22.148 --> 11:24.116
NISCHELLE:
Oh, yeah, it is.
Yeah, it's super--

11:24.183 --> 11:25.684
It's much lower than in here.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.254
I think we have to see
if we can raise the roof.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.389
-Raise the roof.
-We can raise the roof.

11:30.456 --> 11:32.691
-Literally raise the roof...
-We can raise it

11:32.758 --> 11:35.928
...and-and make it as level

It sure is. And you
just put it in and wedge it in.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.992
So you don't even need nails.
Use a hammer.

16:00.059 --> 16:03.162
There you go. Keep going.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.000
Hold on.
Now we got to get the ladder

16:08.067 --> 16:09.668
and knock the top this way.

16:09.735 --> 16:12.104
And we're sure
this is going to hold?

16:12.171 --> 16:15.507
I'm sure.
It's not my first rodeo.

16:15.574 --> 16:18.377
Tighter. There you go,
there you go.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.546
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>With the supporting wall</i>
<i>in place, we can now</i>

16:20.612 --> 16:23.148
<i>turn our attention to</i>
<i>the ceiling in the living room.</i>

16:23.215 --> 16:25.984
So this is
the old plaster ceiling.

16:26.051 --> 16:27.453
You can see how it's,
like, moving.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.154
-Obviously...
- That's an old ceiling.

16:29.221 --> 16:30.723
...it's just sitting there.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.726
This has all got to come down.
So it's a simple process.

16:33.792 --> 16:36.495
You just peel it right
off with that right there.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.297
-Start in there.
-Okay.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.399
ROB: And then
it'll just come right down.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.168
-KANDI: After you do these
renovations, right?
-ROB: Right.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.203
And you do one room...

16:44.269 --> 16:45.371
Yeah, you're gonna want to do

16:45.437 --> 16:46.705
-more and more and more.
-Yeah.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.407
Yeah. That's
how it goes every time.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.542
KANDI:
Once you get it started,
you got to keep it going.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.711
-ROB: There you go.
There you go.
-Oh, yeah, this is loose.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.247
-That's it. And then just
keep moving it.
-Whoa.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.349
-(laughs)
-Don't fall off the ladder.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.185
With all the cousins we have,
you would think somebody

17:00.252 --> 17:01.387
would have became a contractor.

17:01.453 --> 17:02.488
Yeah.
None of them?

17:02.554 --> 17:04.356
-None of them!
-Oh, man.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.559
You know what? We could use
those cousins right about now.

17:07.626 --> 17:11.663
-KANDI: This is crazy.
-ROB: It's work,
no doubt about it.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.699
<i>KANDI:</i>
<i>It's definitely work.</i>

17:18.337 --> 17:20.439
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>With all the demolition done</i>
<i>outside,</i>

17:20.506 --> 17:23.575
<i>we can turn our attention</i>
<i>to the back room kitchen area.</i>

17:23.642 --> 17:26.245
And this time we'll build
it with much higher ceilings.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.214
<i>We will frame out</i>
<i>the base, the walls</i>

17:29.281 --> 17:33.285
<i>and the roof and add</i>
<i>the insulation and the drywall.</i>

17:34.586 --> 17:36.288
<i>And we're completely</i>
<i>opening up the inside</i>

17:36.355 --> 17:39.057
<i>kitchen area</i>
<i>by removing the old walls</i>

17:39.124 --> 17:42.394
<i>and installing the new</i>
<i>support beam.</i>

17:42.461 --> 17:45.264
<i>I have my entire crew in today.</i>

17:45.330 --> 17:48.233
I mean, everybody's here.
Kandi has been working so hard.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.235
I gave her a pass
for the entire day.

17:50.302 --> 17:51.470
-Hello, friends.
-KANDI: Oh, my gosh.

17:51.537 --> 17:52.638
I-- Oh, hey!

17:52.704 --> 17:54.440
-ROB: And here she is.
-Hi, guys.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.141
Listen, Kandi's got heels
in hand, purse on shoulder.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.376
-Oh...
-(laughter)

17:57.443 --> 17:58.477
I could just take a break
from work.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.412
I am so excited.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.348
I could be cute again.
Put my heels on. Boom.

18:06.852 --> 18:09.555
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>I felt like we couldn't come</i>
<i>here without going over</i>

18:09.621 --> 18:11.123
to Old Lady Gang,
because not only

18:11.190 --> 18:12.658
-is it your restaurant...
-Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

18:12.724 --> 18:13.859
...it's also part

18:13.926 --> 18:16.628
-of Aunt Bertha's legacy.
-Yes.

18:16.695 --> 18:20.132
You know, she's on, you know,
the building when you drive up.

18:20.199 --> 18:23.469
Aunt Bertha is the aunt that
I always would call like, okay,

18:23.535 --> 18:25.404
-now how am I supposed to
make that dressing again?
-Right.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.506
How do I--
Okay, what do I do next?

18:27.573 --> 18:30.242
Like, she would talk me through
and help make those recipes.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.577
It's my history.

18:31.643 --> 18:33.412
So Winnie is going to
meet us there.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.447
<i>-That's Aunt Bertha's daughter.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

18:35.514 --> 18:37.115
<i>She's like my big sister.</i>

18:37.182 --> 18:39.117
<i>And also my friend Carmon.</i>

18:39.184 --> 18:40.752
<i>-She's been my best friend</i>
<i>since I was 11 years old.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

18:40.819 --> 18:41.787
I mean, I watch<i> Housewives</i>
and watch all your shows,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.288
so we've seen Carmon.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.523
We know that she's
been there with you

18:44.590 --> 18:45.657
-through everything.
-Yes.

18:45.724 --> 18:47.259
-Okay. Cool. Good.
-Yes.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.498
<i>-NISCHELLE: I spy OLG.</i>
<i>-Yes, yes, yes.</i>

18:52.564 --> 18:54.600
And we've got a parking space
right out here in front.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.201
<i>KANDI:</i>
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

18:56.268 --> 18:58.570
-Well, I do know the owner.
-(laughter)

19:01.840 --> 19:03.308
NISCHELLE:
I love this place, though.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.677
<i>-You know what I really love?</i>
<i>-What?</i>

19:05.744 --> 19:08.146
-Aunt Bertha's fried chicken.
-Me, too.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.615
If I had the fried chicken
and French toast

19:09.681 --> 19:13.185
that you have here,
I'd be here every single day.

19:13.252 --> 19:14.753
It doesn't work well
on our hips.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.855
We gotta, you know,

19:16.922 --> 19:18.724
pace ourselves.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.827
-Hey!
-NISCHELLE: Hi!

19:21.894 --> 19:23.395
Yes! Both of y'all.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.830
I thought I'd give you
a little legs today.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.164
-How you doing?
-Hi.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.200
Hi, Carmon, how are you?

19:28.267 --> 19:30.168
What's good, y'all?

19:30.235 --> 19:31.503
-Oh, everything.
-Everything!

19:31.570 --> 19:33.405
How long have y'all
been friends?

19:33.472 --> 19:34.907
About 35 years.

19:34.973 --> 19:38.410
-Yeah, we met, um,
in sixth grade.
-Really?

19:38.477 --> 19:39.878
And did you all like
each other immediately?

19:39.945 --> 19:41.713
-No.
-No.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.282
(laughter)

19:45.384 --> 19:47.352
Tell her about that time
when I came home

19:47.419 --> 19:48.887
and you had that boy
in the house.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.257
-Now you're talking too much.
-(laughter)

19:52.324 --> 19:54.760
-You're talking too much.
-Winnie!

19:54.826 --> 19:56.828
She said, "Winnie, I promise
I wasn't doing nothing."

19:56.895 --> 19:58.330
-Girl, I was...
-We was just hanging out.

19:58.397 --> 20:00.198
She wasn't doing nothing
back then.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.200
-WINNIE:
I could've, like, choked her.
-Like, wink.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.835
-She didn't tell on me.
-I didn't. That's right.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.204
And she know it ain't going
nowhere but between me and her.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.607
How did that bond come about?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.475
<i>-KANDI:</i>
<i>She's Aunt Bertha's daughter.</i>
<i>-NISCHELLE: Right.</i>

20:10.542 --> 20:11.777
<i>KANDI: I used to be</i>
<i>at their house all the time.</i>

20:11.843 --> 20:12.878
<i>WINNIE:</i>
<i>Yes. When she was little,</i>

20:12.945 --> 20:14.980
<i>Kandi was her favorite little...</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:17.349
-NISCHELLE:
Kandi was her favorite?
-She just pushed us to the side.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.351
-She pushed us to the side.
-(laughter)

20:19.418 --> 20:21.687
SERVER:
Chicken and French toast.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.889
-This looks so good.
-WINNIE: Yes.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.924
I'm going straight for it.

20:25.991 --> 20:28.961
Mmm. Oh, it's-- Ooh...

20:29.027 --> 20:30.762
All right, we're gonna
finish eating,

20:30.829 --> 20:35.233
and then we gotta get back, but
I might be here for a minute.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.269
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>This is so good.</i>

20:37.336 --> 20:40.606
Coming up. I mean, you know
we're supposed, to be done in
two days, right?

20:40.672 --> 20:42.574
Like, two?

20:42.641 --> 20:43.709
<i>NISCHELLE:</i>
<i>The team is running out of time,</i>

20:43.775 --> 20:45.811
<i>and tensions are running high.</i>

20:45.877 --> 20:49.281
Plumbing, appliances,
flooring, two days...

20:49.348 --> 20:51.383
-ROB:
Days and nights at this point.
-Sounds great.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.851
Days and nights.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.755
<i>-But with each project</i>
<i>completed...</i>
-Yeah!

20:56.822 --> 20:59.424
<i>-...the house is</i>
<i>transforming so much...</i>
-What?!

20:59.491 --> 21:00.692
<i>...Carmon doesn't even</i>
<i>recognize it.</i>

21:00.759 --> 21:02.394
Are you serious?

21:09.067 --> 21:11.536
<i>NISCHELLE: Over the last 46</i>
<i>years, Aunt Bertha has been</i>

21:11.603 --> 21:14.339
<i>both Kandi's advisor</i>
<i>and inspiration.</i>

21:14.406 --> 21:17.409
<i>Now, in what may be our most</i>
<i>dramatic renovation yet...</i>

21:17.476 --> 21:20.812
SABRINA:
This is going to
Completely transform the house.

21:20.879 --> 21:23.382
<i>...Kandi is going to give</i>
<i>Aunt Bertha a new living room</i>

21:23.448 --> 21:26.451
<i>and beautiful</i>
<i>open floor plan kitchen.</i>

21:29.521 --> 21:30.956
<i>SABRINA: This renovation</i>
<i>is a big undertaking,</i>

21:31.023 --> 21:33.492
<i>but Rob's crew has</i>
<i>been making some headway.</i>

21:35.727 --> 21:38.397
<i>The back kitchen area is</i>
<i>really starting to come to life</i>

21:38.463 --> 21:42.300
<i>with a new door,</i>
<i>drywall, and trim work.</i>

21:42.367 --> 21:44.770
<i>And now that the living room</i>
<i>has been painted and the new</i>

21:44.836 --> 21:48.006
<i>flooring has been installed,</i>
<i>I have the perfect little</i>

21:48.073 --> 21:50.375
painting project for Kandi
and I to knock out.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.745
KANDI:
My goodness.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.914
So since this
fireplace is only decorative,

21:55.981 --> 21:58.617
-I'm going to
paint the firebox black.
-Mm-hmm.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.386
And then we'll put
these birch logs in there.

22:01.453 --> 22:04.556
You know, it is so crazy
that you even thought

22:04.623 --> 22:06.558
to do that because
we've been in this house

22:06.625 --> 22:08.927
for so long, we don't even
know how to see it differently.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.596
I totally get that. I mean,
if people ask my advice on how

22:11.663 --> 22:13.331
to change up their house,
I would say get somebody

22:13.398 --> 22:14.800
who hasn't been to your
house in a long time

22:14.866 --> 22:17.769
-to come over with fresh eyes.
-Right.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.638
Because then you have new ideas.

22:19.705 --> 22:21.073
I mean, this house
has been in your family

22:21.139 --> 22:23.375
-for so long.
-My entire life.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.712
I cannot wait for the two weeks

22:26.778 --> 22:28.980
to be up only just
because I can't wait to

22:29.047 --> 22:31.983
-see her face when
she walks into the house.
-Oh, my gosh.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.585
You know, it's just
getting started,

22:33.652 --> 22:34.986
but I don't think,
by the time everything's

22:35.053 --> 22:36.688
finished, I don't think that

22:36.755 --> 22:38.023
-she's going to
recognize the place.
-No.

22:41.893 --> 22:46.765
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>With only a couple days left</i>
<i>on this huge renovation,</i>

22:46.832 --> 22:48.967
I have my entire crew in
to give us a fighting chance

22:49.034 --> 22:50.702
for the big reveal.

22:51.903 --> 22:55.507
<i>Out back, we built a brand-new</i>
<i>little deck for Aunt Bertha</i>

22:55.574 --> 22:58.977
<i>so she had a place to sit</i>
<i>and enjoy her backyard.</i>

22:59.044 --> 23:00.679
<i>And we finished up</i>
<i>the brickwork,</i>

23:00.746 --> 23:03.415
<i>closing off the old</i>
<i>kitchen window.</i>

23:03.482 --> 23:05.083
Most of our time was spent on

23:05.150 --> 23:08.687
<i>the open floor plan kitchen,</i>
<i>which is now a very big space.</i>

23:08.754 --> 23:12.023
<i>New cabinets,</i>
<i>new electric lines,</i>

23:12.090 --> 23:14.826
<i>and the new countertops</i>
<i>and backsplash</i>

23:14.893 --> 23:16.962
<i>that Sabrina picked out.</i>

23:18.964 --> 23:21.166
It's definitely getting there.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.002
I mean, you know we're supposed
to be done in two days, right?

23:24.069 --> 23:27.005
-That's what I keep hearing.
-(Rob sighs)

23:27.072 --> 23:30.075
ROB:
Is the ceiling crooked
or is the cabinet crooked?

23:30.142 --> 23:32.410
Probably a combination of both.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.914
That's no good.
That's got to be addressed.

23:35.981 --> 23:38.083
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>We still have a ton</i>
<i>of stuff to get done.</i>

23:38.150 --> 23:38.917
What about the floor?

23:38.984 --> 23:39.918
<i>The faucet needs</i>

23:39.985 --> 23:41.086
<i>to be installed.</i>

23:41.153 --> 23:42.053
<i>All the appliances</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:43.455
<i>need to be hooked up.</i>

23:43.522 --> 23:44.856
<i>The utilities need to go in,</i>

23:44.923 --> 23:47.759
as well as
all kinds of other fixes.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.861
And all these things take time.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.930
And quite frankly,
we're running out of it.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.032
Is this plumbed in? Oh,
we got to do all the plumbing

23:54.099 --> 23:55.467
in here, too, still.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.669
We still have so much
to get done.

23:57.736 --> 24:00.105
And while we're busy
talking about the schedule,

24:00.172 --> 24:02.440
that clock
is still ticking away.

24:02.507 --> 24:03.575
At this point, we need to just

24:03.642 --> 24:06.711
<i>focus on</i>
<i>keeping forward momentum.</i>

24:06.778 --> 24:08.480
After I put these pieces on,

24:08.547 --> 24:10.782
we got to finish the flooring
in the corner over there,

24:10.849 --> 24:12.884
finish up the plumbing.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.920
Plumbing, appliances, flooring,

24:14.986 --> 24:17.756
-two days...
-Days and nights at this point.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.225
-Sounds great.
-Days and nights.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.227
This is an
all-hands-on-deck race.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.929
So while I
continue in the kitchen,

24:23.995 --> 24:27.632
<i>I asked Sabrina and Kandi</i>
<i>to cut some wood trim that we're</i>

24:28.867 --> 24:30.168

24:32.237 --> 24:34.906
-you don't do it right.
-Obviously.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.608
-I mean, yeah, obviously.
-I got it.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.077
So, I just want a few cuts.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.679
-Mm-hmm.
-Pull it back.

24:40.745 --> 24:44.649
Make sure your left hand
is far away from the saw.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.119
This is my first time

24:48.186 --> 24:50.088

24:59.064 --> 25:00.966
-Yes.
-Ooh!

Not only did Kandi pick it up

<i>The miter saw truly</i>

it's something about it.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.512

25:18.183 --> 25:20.151
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

25:20.218 --> 25:21.253
I don't know.
I can't explain it.

25:21.319 --> 25:22.787
You have to try it yourself.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.190

I'm telling you.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.828
<i>ROB:</i>
<i>Kandi and Sabrina did</i>

25:29.895 --> 25:31.296

25:31.363 --> 25:33.064
to cross projects off the list.

25:33.131 --> 25:35.066

straight, and I'll go from

25:35.133 --> 25:39.204
-underneath and screw it on.
-It doesn't stay up?

25:39.271 --> 25:40.906
It will once it's connected...

25:40.972 --> 25:43.775
-Oh, okay.
-...but it's not connected yet.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.011
Installing a faucet is much
easier with two people.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.245

to hold that square like that.

-KANDI: It's straight.
-ROB: It is?

-Yep.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.280
KANDI:

-Yeah, we're good.

Oh, hello.

26:56.915 --> 26:57.983
Hey.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.319

over to see

27:01.386 --> 27:02.954
the work that we've been doing.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.223
We've been friends since
I was 11 years old,

27:05.290 --> 27:07.959
so she's been to this house
with me plenty of times,

27:08.026 --> 27:10.795
and she didn't even
recognize it.

27:10.862 --> 27:13.965
-What?!
-(laughter)

27:14.032 --> 27:15.700
Are you serious?

27:15.767 --> 27:17.669
<i>Even I--</i>
<i>Now I'm trying to remember</i>

27:17.736 --> 27:21.039
what did the house used to look
like, because it's so different.

27:21.106 --> 27:25.343
They raised the roof,
and look at this,

27:25.410 --> 27:27.912
-and put a back door this way.
-Oh, my God.

27:27.979 --> 27:31.916
And now it's
a little deck on the back.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.920
-See?
-This is so cute. I love it.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.655
<i>KANDI:</i>
<i>Carmon was so excited</i>

27:37.722 --> 27:39.024
and surprised about it,

27:39.090 --> 27:41.926
and really loved
the way everything looks.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.929
<i>I can only imagine the way</i>
<i>that the rest of my family is</i>

27:44.996 --> 27:47.432
going to feel when they see it,
especially Aunt Bertha.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.434
So how do you think
she's going to feel now

27:49.501 --> 27:52.937
about being able to sit out
here on the patio and stuff?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.874
-She is going to love
sitting out here on her porch.
-Mm-hmm.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.043
Every time I used to
come up, she always used to be

27:58.109 --> 28:00.078
-sitting on the patio.
-Yeah.

28:00.145 --> 28:02.981
As people come up the stairs,
they would see them.

28:03.048 --> 28:06.418
(imitating Bertha):
"Hey there. How you doin'?"

28:06.484 --> 28:08.720
(laughter)

28:08.787 --> 28:11.823
So now that everything

of doing the family dinners
every Sunday for years.

28:23.835 --> 28:25.904

over here, and she just

28:25.970 --> 28:27.806
-kept that tradition going.
-Yeah.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.107
-You know, she's 80.
-Wow.

28:29.174 --> 28:32.077
She's 80 years old,
and I don't think

28:32.143 --> 28:34.212
-she would have ever
done anything like this.
-Yeah, yeah.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.281
-Definitely not for herself.
-Right.

be able to do something

28:39.350 --> 28:42.120

see her home differently,

28:42.187 --> 28:44.956

look like my back.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.623
-No.
-No, it's brand-new.

40:59.690 --> 41:00.925
It's a perfect day.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.593
-Yes.
-Yes.

41:02.660 --> 41:03.961
Well, I think that we do need

41:04.028 --> 41:05.196
to have your family see it
a little bit.

41:05.262 --> 41:06.964
-Let's go have a little party.
-Okay.

41:07.031 --> 41:08.766
-You want to go
have a little party?
-Yes.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.534
<i>KANDI: I think the way</i>
<i>that the house was before--</i>

41:10.601 --> 41:13.170
it totally reflected
how old the house was.

41:13.237 --> 41:15.906
<i>Now the house is</i>
<i>so much brighter.</i>

41:15.973 --> 41:18.676
<i>-It feels new again.</i>
<i>-NISCHELLE: And you have</i>

41:18.742 --> 41:21.478
one more Sunday dinner here
now in your new space?

41:21.545 --> 41:24.081
-Yes.
-Okay. So the family can...

41:24.148 --> 41:25.950
Long as they don't drop nothing.

41:26.016 --> 41:27.484
(laughter)

41:27.551 --> 41:30.955
-WINNIE: Hey, Aunt Nora.
-KANDI: Hi, Aunt Nora.

41:31.021 --> 41:33.757
-Come on in!
-(laughter)

41:33.824 --> 41:35.960
<i>KANDI:</i>
<i>Now that the renovation is done,</i>

41:36.026 --> 41:38.162
<i>I know that my family</i>
<i>cannot wait</i>

41:38.229 --> 41:39.230
<i>to come and break this house in</i>

41:39.296 --> 41:40.998
<i>with a good old cookout,</i>

41:41.065 --> 41:42.600
even though she said
we can't eat on the couch.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.901
-(indistinct chatter)
-There they come.

41:43.968 --> 41:45.269
Oh, speak of the devil.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.004
So, what do you think? Yeah?

41:47.071 --> 41:49.540
-(applause and cheering)
-All right! Round of applause!

41:49.607 --> 41:51.642
-First time.
-Yes. Yeah.

41:51.709 --> 41:53.010
Aunt Bertha, tell 'em
how you feel about the house.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.945
I love it.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.847
I'm so glad.
So when's the first meal?

41:56.914 --> 41:58.682
-Uh...
-Listen.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.784
Well, Todd got
to buy some groceries first.

42:00.851 --> 42:01.952
-(laughter)
-I'm on my way.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.287
<i>KANDI:</i>
<i>Aunt Bertha is</i>

42:03.354 --> 42:05.122
the matriarch,
and I love her dearly.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.993
And I am so excited that I could
do something like this for her.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.061
Any of y'all

42:11.128 --> 42:15.966
is more than welcome
to come into my house.

42:16.033 --> 42:20.070
And I'm a terrific... cook.

42:20.137 --> 42:22.606
(laughter and cheering)

42:22.673 --> 42:24.675
-All right.
<i>-BERTHA: I think it's amazing.</i>

42:24.742 --> 42:26.243
-(laughter)
-Hey.

42:26.310 --> 42:29.146
<i>BERTHA:</i>
<i>And I'd just like to thank Kandi</i>

42:29.213 --> 42:31.749
from the bottom of my heart

42:31.815 --> 42:34.818
for everything
she have done for me.
