00:01.436 --> 00:02.611
<i>Last time</i> <i>
on</i> Naomi...

00:05.744 --> 00:09.313
<i>Every superhero has an
origin story and this is mine.</i>

00:09.357 --> 00:11.576
What's going on?

00:11.620 --> 00:13.404
<i>Annabelle says</i> <i>
there's a stunt</i> <i>
happening in the square.</i>

00:13.448 --> 00:15.580
<i>Something happened to me</i> <i>
during the Superman thing.</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.104
<i>Then I went to the woods</i>

00:17.147 --> 00:19.062
<i>and found some kind of disc.</i>

00:19.106 --> 00:21.369
It can be hard once you realize
you're not like everyone else.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.892
Stay back!

00:25.329 --> 00:27.984
You were there
on the day I was adopted.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.726
Who...
Who are you?

00:30.769 --> 00:33.076
Still asking
the wrong question.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.035
What is the question?

00:36.949 --> 00:37.776
Who am I?

00:58.145 --> 00:59.842
I don't know who you are.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.844
Not exactly.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.281
But I know that
it all started

01:04.325 --> 01:06.979
March 14th, 2004,

01:07.023 --> 01:10.026
when I saw the light
in the sky.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.767
That's when I first sensed it.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.203
Sensed what?

01:13.247 --> 01:14.074
You.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.467
What does that mean?

01:16.511 --> 01:20.384
There are invisible
vibrations all around us.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.517
In the air, in the water,

01:22.560 --> 01:23.387
the trees.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.520
People like us

01:26.956 --> 01:30.177
have a unique
vibrational signature.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.309
Think of it like
a, uh, fingerprint.

01:33.789 --> 01:36.705
My wings give me
the ability to sense it.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.228
Your wings,
because you have wings.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.319
They're a part of me,

01:43.320 --> 01:44.887
made from a rare metal

01:44.930 --> 01:46.018
found on...

01:48.064 --> 01:48.891
my home planet.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
Your home planet?

01:54.157 --> 01:55.027
Thanagar.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.378
Thanagar...

01:58.422 --> 02:00.250
Right.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.426
But if you're from
another planet,
that would mean...

02:02.470 --> 02:05.386
I'm not human.

02:05.429 --> 02:09.259
And if your, if your
special wings could sense me,
that would mean...

02:09.303 --> 02:10.478
You're not human either.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.657
Okay.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
This isn't real.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.095
I'm having
a very bad dream
right now

02:19.139 --> 02:20.705
and I just need to wake up.

02:20.749 --> 02:22.707
Just wake up Naomi,
just wake up, just wake up.

02:22.751 --> 02:27.408
Sometimes when
I'm stressed, I, uh...
I do some deep breathing.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.584
I think I'll stick
with the straight-up
panic attack.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.543
I know it's a lot.

02:34.632 --> 02:36.286
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

02:36.330 --> 02:39.768
You don't just blow up
someone's life for no reason.

02:39.811 --> 02:41.161
Your abilities
seemed dormant.

02:42.379 --> 02:43.250
You seemed...

02:44.642 --> 02:46.122
happy.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.823
I think that's enough
for tonight.

02:51.867 --> 02:54.174
You should go home
and get some rest.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.959
I'm pretty sure I'm never
gonna sleep again,

02:57.002 --> 02:59.266
and plus, I have like a
million more questions.

02:59.309 --> 03:00.832
I know,

03:00.876 --> 03:02.486
and I'll do my best
to answer them.

03:03.357 --> 03:04.227
I promise.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.142
Tomorrow.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.709
Please.

03:07.752 --> 03:11.582
You just told me
I'm an alien
from outer space.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.455
No disrespect, but am I really
just supposed to believe you?

03:15.412 --> 03:16.283
No.

03:17.240 --> 03:18.110
I'll prove it.

03:33.996 --> 03:36.259
I know
my birth parents
died in a crash...

03:38.130 --> 03:40.045
but what kind?

03:40.089 --> 03:42.526
Was it a car or a plane
or a bus?

03:44.485 --> 03:46.269
We don't know, pumpkin.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.792
You know we don't know.

03:47.836 --> 03:51.056
We've talked about this
dozens of times.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.362
Baby, what's going on?

03:52.884 --> 03:53.711
Nothing.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.197
I guess I've just been
thinking about it,

04:01.241 --> 04:02.503
lately, that's all.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.331
That's
completely normal.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.942
You're getting older
and it's natural
to want answers.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.640
We wish we had them,
but you know everything
we know.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.557
But is there anything else?

04:13.601 --> 04:16.299
Like what town, or was
anyone else there?

04:16.343 --> 04:19.171
All the agency would tell us is
that it was on the East Coast.
It was a...

04:20.347 --> 04:21.348
It was a closed adoption.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.786
But didn't it bother you?

04:24.829 --> 04:28.050
Not knowing who I really am
or where I actually came from?

04:28.093 --> 04:30.008
None of that mattered to us.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.053
It still doesn't.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.447
We know who you are.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.623
You're our daughter.

04:36.667 --> 04:37.799
Our miracle.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.328
I better...

04:47.025 --> 04:48.505
start getting ready.

04:48.549 --> 04:49.376
Excuse me.

04:54.685 --> 04:55.512
I'm sorry, Dad.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.515
We're your parents.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.431
Keeping you safe
is basically our entire job.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.260
So it's...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.610
hard to accept that we can't
keep you safe from everything.

05:09.787 --> 05:10.788
But what I can promise

05:12.355 --> 05:13.530
is that we love you

05:14.749 --> 05:15.663
and we are here for you.

05:17.621 --> 05:18.840
I know that, Dad.

05:18.883 --> 05:19.710
I really do.

05:21.451 --> 05:22.322
Good.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.413
Better get to school.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.781
Whoa!

06:30.825 --> 06:33.349
Sorry, I thought you might, uh,
want some caffeine

06:33.393 --> 06:34.698
after our
late night expedition.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.831
That's really nice, thanks.

06:36.874 --> 06:38.354
I'm sorry we didn't find
that disc you were looking for
at Zumbado's.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.790
Oh! That's okay.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.575
Uh...
I mean, it was fun though.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.447
Hanging out with you
is always fun, actually, uh,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.667
and, I mean,
it got me thinking.

06:46.710 --> 06:50.192
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to, um, hang out
this weekend? Or...

06:51.323 --> 06:53.456
Maybe without the trespassing.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.458
We could try that new,
uh, pizza place.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.242
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Pizza sounds good.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.461
Really?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.158
Okay, great, okay, wow, okay!

07:00.202 --> 07:01.551
All right, text me later?

07:01.595 --> 07:03.205
Okay, yes,
I'll... I'll text you later.

07:03.248 --> 07:04.119
Thanks for this!

07:05.163 --> 07:06.034
You're welcome.

07:14.999 --> 07:15.826
Dee?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.002
Naomi.

07:18.046 --> 07:18.873
You made it.

07:22.616 --> 07:23.704
I don't really like heights.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.490
Did you know

07:27.534 --> 07:29.797
that the first bridges
were built by the people
of ancient Egypt?

07:31.407 --> 07:32.930
No machinery.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.716
Just chisels and stones
with their own two hands.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.459
Humans have the capacity
to do incredible things.

07:40.764 --> 07:41.809
What are we doing here?

07:43.245 --> 07:44.289
Jumping.

07:48.119 --> 07:49.773
Hold up, you're serious?

07:49.817 --> 07:50.687
You asked for proof.

07:51.514 --> 07:52.472
Here it is.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.995
You'll defy gravity.

07:54.038 --> 07:56.127
You won't even make a splash.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.651
You won't get hurt.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.609
That's easy for you to say.
You have wings.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.524
True.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.094
Have you ever had
a broken bone?

08:07.574 --> 08:08.705
Stitches?

08:08.749 --> 08:10.185
Any injuries at all?

08:10.228 --> 08:11.360
Sure.

08:11.403 --> 08:12.274
When?

08:15.407 --> 08:16.278
You've never been injured...

08:17.845 --> 08:19.411
because you're not like
everyone else.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.372
Besides, if I'm wrong,

08:23.415 --> 08:24.678
what's the worst
that can happen?

08:27.071 --> 08:29.857
You make a big splash,
break your foot.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.380
That sounds pretty bad.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.470
You're afraid.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.472
You just told me
to jump off a bridge.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.387
What happened to you
in the woods,

08:38.430 --> 08:40.041
the lights going out
in my shop,

08:40.781 --> 08:42.565
that was all you.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.525
The sooner you accept that,
the safer you'll be.

08:46.656 --> 08:47.614
Safe from what?

08:49.006 --> 08:50.834
Your world has
fundamentally changed

08:52.401 --> 08:55.056
and I doubt I'm
the only one who's noticed.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.321
We need to get you ready.

09:08.765 --> 09:09.723
It's impossible.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.074
Superman once told me,

09:14.771 --> 09:16.947
impossible is relative.

09:16.991 --> 09:17.818
Superman?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.690
I fought with him in a war

09:20.734 --> 09:21.604
a long time ago.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.607
He is real, Naomi.

09:31.832 --> 09:32.659
No.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.314
I'm sorry, but no.

09:36.358 --> 09:39.056
Superheroes are not real.
Aliens are not real.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.843
Your wings must have been
some kind of harness or machine
or something.

09:42.886 --> 09:48.370
And the light that you saw
in the sky was probably
a meteor or satellite.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.329
I'm gonna find the crash site
and figure out what
really happened that day.

09:57.466 --> 09:58.293
You're not ready.

10:02.036 --> 10:05.430
To accept that I'm an alien
from outer space? No.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.344
No, I'm not.

10:13.221 --> 10:14.091
Dee!

10:20.924 --> 10:23.753
Finding the crash site
won't change the truth, Naomi.

10:24.711 --> 10:25.537
This is real,

10:26.582 --> 10:28.671
whether you believe it or not.

10:35.547 --> 10:38.289
Mrs. M! Hi!
Is that a new top?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.900
Loving that color on you.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.685
Thanks, honey.
I went shopping last week.

10:42.729 --> 10:46.123
You were right,
I can pull off pastels.
Want a smoothie?

10:46.167 --> 10:48.952
You know I do.
Naomi sent me a soft 911.

10:48.996 --> 10:52.173
It's one step down from an
actual medical emergency.

10:52.216 --> 10:55.306
It includes,
but is not limited to,
romantic emergency,

10:55.350 --> 10:58.745
school emergency,
snack emergency,
fashion emergency.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.094
Good to know.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.139
She's working
on a school project.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.141
It's a little...
intense in there.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.754
<i>♪ I'm true to my squad</i>

11:07.797 --> 11:09.233
<i>♪ I'm true to my dead ones</i> <i>
Who walk with me</i> <i>
Know when I'm flawed ♪</i>

11:09.277 --> 11:11.192
<i>♪ I'm true to my squad</i>

11:11.235 --> 11:13.150
<i>♪ True to the people who see me</i> <i>

11:13.194 --> 11:15.675
You know, I always thought
we'd be cute, little
old ladies

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
before we went full
conspiracy theorist.

11:17.764 --> 11:18.982
Good, you're here.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.463
Uh, can you come
help me with this?

11:21.506 --> 11:23.900
What's going on here, babe?

11:23.944 --> 11:26.686
It's a topographic map
of Port Oswego.

11:26.729 --> 11:30.646
It's pretty dope.
It shows water, elevation,
surface features.

11:30.690 --> 11:35.303
No, um, what's going on here?

11:35.346 --> 11:38.698
There was a UFO sighting back
in Port Oswego in 2004.

11:38.741 --> 11:42.136
And we're hunting
aliens because...

11:42.179 --> 11:44.834
We're not.
That's the point.

11:44.878 --> 11:49.752
UFO doesn't mean
aliens. It means
unidentified flying object.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.799
So, I'm trying to identify it.

11:54.975 --> 11:58.935
Right.
Weren't we on a disc mission,
like, five minutes ago?

11:58.979 --> 12:01.068
This is more important.

12:01.111 --> 12:04.201
There've been a lot of
UFO sightings in Port Oswego,
like, a lot.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.681
Did you know that?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.901
Can't say that I did.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.904
A lot of people thought that
the March 14th UFO landed in
Red River Forest.

12:10.947 --> 12:14.385
But I compared
the wind reports to an article
about soil testing

12:14.429 --> 12:17.171
and my theory is that it landed
somewhere around Falls Creek.

12:18.215 --> 12:19.782
I want to go look around.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.044
Mom said that
I can borrow the car.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.439
March 14th, 2004?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.615
As in the day
you were adopted.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.096
I think it was a secret
military drone and that's
why no one came forward.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.968
- Apparently the
government was running this--
- Naomi!

12:32.012 --> 12:34.492
You are telling me,
on the day you were adopted,

12:34.536 --> 12:40.194
way on the others side of
the country, there was a UFO
sighting here in Port Oswego...

12:40.237 --> 12:42.065
where you now live.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.980
Smoothie time.

12:44.024 --> 12:46.504
Fresh fruits and vitamin C
coming your way.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.158
Thanks, Mom.
- You're the best, Mrs. M.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.160
Naomi, I just got
a call from Dad.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.945
He's stuck at work
so you won't be able to use
the car tonight.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.733
Don't worry.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.822
I happen to know
somebody else
who loves UFOs.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.359
No offense, hon,
but will this thing even
make it to Falls Creek?

13:15.403 --> 13:17.535
Shh. You'll hurt her feelings.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.799
Who wants snacks?

13:19.842 --> 13:21.496
Ooh, now it's a road trip.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.324
- You got any
gummy bears in there?
- Ew!

13:25.152 --> 13:26.283
Thank you.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.160
You wanted
to see me, sir?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.336
I did.
Come on in, Major.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.468
Have a seat.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.905
Very impressive
resume, Major.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.647
Counterintelligence analyst
for the DOD,

13:42.691 --> 13:44.867
on-the-ground experience
in several countries.

13:44.911 --> 13:45.737
Thank you, sir.

13:48.871 --> 13:52.135
You're aware of the incident
that happened a few days ago
in the town square.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.268
The Superman publicity stunt?

13:54.311 --> 13:56.531
We're not sure
what it was.

13:56.574 --> 14:00.622
All we know is that it was
an unidentified flying object
near our base.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.972
I thought the owner
of the tattoo shop
admitted to planning it.

14:03.016 --> 14:06.628
He did. But we think that
there is more to the story.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.467
Our team found this
during a sweep of
the Red River Forest

14:19.510 --> 14:21.382
near the alleged
landing site.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.906
Our lab techs have had it
for the last couple of days.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.954
We can't break it,
burn it, blow it up.
It's virtually indestructible.

14:31.261 --> 14:34.221
Sounds like boron carbide
or maybe some other
kind of synthetic.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.744
That's what I thought.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.573
But the technology
is far more advanced.

14:38.616 --> 14:40.967
It's unlike anything
we've ever seen.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.404
And you think it has
something to do with
the Superman incident?

14:43.447 --> 14:44.927
I don't know what to think.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.581
Why would Dee say
he planned it if he didn't?

14:48.713 --> 14:49.758
What does he have
to do with this?

14:53.849 --> 14:55.242
That's what I need you
to find out.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.293
I am definitely not wearing
the right shoes for this.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.427
Speaking of shoes, Naomi,

15:06.470 --> 15:08.777
let's talk about what pair
you're gonna wear
on your date with Anthony.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.518
- What?
- My first thought
is your blue high tops

15:10.561 --> 15:12.476
but your Chucks could be
super cute too. I mean--

15:12.520 --> 15:14.087
No, what do you mean, date?

15:14.130 --> 15:15.479
Was Anthony not supposed
to tell me?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.352
I think he was just excited.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.616
We're having pizza like we do
all the time. It's not a date.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.227
It's not a date!

15:25.576 --> 15:27.274
So much internal cringe, babe.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.493
What's in the suitcase?

15:30.233 --> 15:31.539
My gear.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.324
Every good UFO investigator
has gear.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.325
He thinks aliens are real.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.719
Really?

15:37.762 --> 15:39.025
Definitely.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.417
It's pretty much
a mathematical certainty.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.335
But there's never been
any proof that they exist.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.815
There's never been
any proof that they don't.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.739
What exactly are
we looking for?

15:57.782 --> 16:00.046
I mean, 16 years
is a long time.

16:00.089 --> 16:03.179
Debris or any other
evidence of a crash.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.181
Trees that are broken.
Newer growth.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.661
Scorch marks or burns.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.010
There could also be
trace elements.

16:08.054 --> 16:09.577
Like radiation or chemicals.

16:12.058 --> 16:12.884
I'm good.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.497
Latex isn't really my color.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.194
Let's get started.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.457
<i>♪ You know you wanna</i>

17:11.639 --> 17:14.511
I should have
worn gloves.
This sap is everywhere.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.818
It's bigleaf maple.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.342
Very tasty on pancakes,
but very messy.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.091
[Annabelle, muffled] Naomi?

17:29.135 --> 17:30.049
[Annabelle, muffled] Naomi.

17:31.876 --> 17:32.703
Naomi!

17:33.530 --> 17:34.401
Are you okay?

17:35.576 --> 17:36.707
I could hear it, Annabelle.

17:37.447 --> 17:38.318
Hear what?

17:39.188 --> 17:40.059
Everything.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.239
Okay.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.632
Don't freak out.

17:48.676 --> 17:51.853
See, when someone says that,
it means you definitely
should be freaking out.

17:51.896 --> 17:52.767
Are you moving?

17:55.248 --> 17:58.251
After we broke into Zumbado's,
I went to see Dee and...

17:59.948 --> 18:01.906
things got weird.

18:01.950 --> 18:04.561
He sprouted these, like,
actual metal wings
and then he told me that

18:04.605 --> 18:09.653
he's an alien from outer space
and that he thinks that I too
am an alien from outer space.

18:11.873 --> 18:14.005
Oh, and he also said
that Superman is real.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.099
Annabelle, please
say something.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.885
I am literally speechless.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.714
It's never happened
to me before.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.761
OMG, babe!
Are you a superhero?

18:30.805 --> 18:32.546
No! No.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.939
Suddenly the whole UFO thing
makes so much more sense...

18:34.983 --> 18:39.161
Wait, why are we trying
to prove you're
not a superhero?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.990
Aliens aren't real.
Superheroes aren't real.

18:42.730 --> 18:43.948
Right?

18:43.992 --> 18:46.168
But what if they are?

18:46.212 --> 18:49.824
If you could be
any character from Greek
mythology, who would you be?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.042
What?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.653
It's, uh, one of my questions.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.046
For our project?

18:55.090 --> 18:56.787
Here's my list.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.441
Mine's not done yet.
I'm sorry.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.140
I'd be Zeus.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.621
He has like, a ton of powers,
which make him the coolest.

19:04.665 --> 19:09.060
Maybe having all those powers
wasn't actually that fun.

19:09.104 --> 19:14.327
Or maybe Zeus wished that
he could just be regular god
without all the pressure.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.720
Or maybe he didn't want
to be a god at all.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.246
What is happening right now?

19:21.899 --> 19:23.553
Nothing.

19:23.597 --> 19:24.946
Can you come by after soccer
to work on our project?

19:26.252 --> 19:28.167
Sure.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.820
Do you think your mom
would make me a smoothie?

19:29.864 --> 19:32.127
Totally. Yesterday's had
fresh coconut.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.781
The woman is a visionary.

19:38.786 --> 19:39.700
Thanks for this.

19:40.657 --> 19:41.484
Anytime.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.751
All these trees
look exactly the same.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.798
What are we hoping to see here?

19:50.841 --> 19:53.714
Patterns, markings,
anything we might have
missed at the site.

19:57.892 --> 20:01.374
Wait, is this Falls Creek?

20:01.417 --> 20:03.376
I can't believe you guys
went there.
Because of Steve O'Brien?

20:05.726 --> 20:07.815
Since you are looking
into the 2004 sighting,
I assumed you knew.

20:07.858 --> 20:09.773
It's a Port Oswego
urban legend.

20:09.817 --> 20:13.560
Let's definitely tell
horror stories in
an actual dark room.

20:13.603 --> 20:17.868
So, Steve is this local guy
who is obsessed with UFOs.

20:17.912 --> 20:22.395
And in 2004 he would have
been a junior or senior
in high school.

20:22.438 --> 20:27.008
He and some friends went
into the woods
to look for the crash site.

20:27.051 --> 20:30.925
And apparently some
weird stuff started
to happen at Falls Creek.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.666
What kind of weird stuff?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.494
It depends
on who you ask.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.974
Some people think he saw
the ghosts of dead loggers

20:37.018 --> 20:41.196
and other people claim
he saw Bigfoot.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.547
Lot of people just
think he was high
with his friends. But, uh...

20:44.591 --> 20:48.769
After he came back from
the woods, Steve refused
to talk about it.

20:52.512 --> 20:53.948
Where is he now?

20:53.991 --> 20:55.036
He still lives in Port Oswego.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.567
This is where Steve lives?

21:04.611 --> 21:07.440
Was really expecting more of
a cabin in the woods vibe,

21:07.483 --> 21:10.312
It's a lot less true crime
and more mommy blogger.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.756
Anthony, you got tall.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.367
Thanks for
making the time
to see us, Mr. O'Brien.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.455
Sure, sure.

21:22.498 --> 21:23.804
How's your dad these days?

21:23.847 --> 21:25.022
Ah, my father's good, sir.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.198
Work's just a little slow.

21:27.242 --> 21:30.506
Uh, my dad and Mr. O'Brien
have done some logging jobs
back in the day.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.856
So, what can I do for you?

21:32.900 --> 21:35.424
Anthony said something
about a school project.

21:37.208 --> 21:39.210
It's about the UFO
back in 2004.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.826
I'm not really
into UFOs any more.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.523
Because of what happened
in 2004?

21:48.785 --> 21:50.221
It's less about what happened

21:50.265 --> 21:52.702
and more about what I wanted
for my life.

21:52.746 --> 21:57.577
I realized I could keep
being the strange UFO guy

21:57.620 --> 22:00.449
or I could fit in with
everyone else, be normal.

22:07.630 --> 22:08.979
What happened back then?

22:11.025 --> 22:13.244
I... I don't like
to talk about it.

22:13.288 --> 22:14.550
Please.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.421
It's important.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.076
Um, I can't really explain it.
I just...

22:21.340 --> 22:22.863
I feel like I'm meant
to solve this.

22:26.388 --> 22:28.956
I remember that feeling.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.227
I was skateboarding
in the square

22:39.270 --> 22:40.576
<i>when I saw the light that day.</i>

22:55.635 --> 22:58.333
<i>So me and a couple</i> <i>
of my friends</i>

22:58.377 --> 23:00.509
decided to try
and find the crash site.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.992
We were almost to the mill

23:05.035 --> 23:08.038
when things
started to happen.

23:09.910 --> 23:14.088
The woods
started to feel... alive.

23:14.131 --> 23:17.178
We heard voices.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.443
Lots of...
Lots of voices.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.012
We never saw
anyone else out there.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.844
What happened when
you got to the mill?

23:32.149 --> 23:33.716
We never
made it inside.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.457
We were almost there.

23:35.501 --> 23:36.458
We heard this...

23:37.764 --> 23:38.939
horrible noise.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.944
And then I saw this
really bright light...

23:46.076 --> 23:48.470
and that's all
I can remember before.

23:51.081 --> 23:51.995
Before what?

23:55.434 --> 24:01.483
Um, I was somehow back
at the car and I have no
idea how I got there.

24:08.577 --> 24:11.188
We didn't see a mill
at Falls Creek.

24:11.232 --> 24:14.931
Falls Creek?
- The crash site.

24:14.975 --> 24:20.502
The UFO didn't
land at Falls Creek.
We were a few miles away.

24:24.332 --> 24:25.942
We've been looking
in the wrong place.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.172
We have to find that mill.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.479
No, thank you.

24:40.522 --> 24:43.133
Those voices Steve heard
must have been someone
trying to cover up the crash.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.005
Maybe the military
or someone else.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.836
Jacob, you're with me, right?

24:50.793 --> 24:51.751
Definitely.

24:54.710 --> 24:56.407
Well, not technically.

24:56.451 --> 24:57.408
I'm with you in spirit.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.762
My backlog of homework is
getting pretty serious.

25:02.805 --> 25:03.806
Same.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.112
Me, too.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.722
No, we have to solve this!

25:10.117 --> 25:11.510
I thought we were
just having fun.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.167
You're right.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.780
I'm sorry.

25:20.823 --> 25:23.043
Thanks for all your help.
We should pack this up.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.131
I'll go get some boxes.

25:42.802 --> 25:43.759
Is this a safe space?

25:45.805 --> 25:47.546
I'm sorry for snapping at you.

25:51.288 --> 25:54.030
I know that weird stuff
is happening to me, but,

25:54.074 --> 25:56.642
aliens, superheroes.
It's crazy, right?

25:57.817 --> 25:58.731
I don't know, babe.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.561
I mean, yes,
it seems crazy,

26:02.604 --> 26:03.866
maybe even impossible, but...

26:06.652 --> 26:10.003
I mean, people used to think
the Earth was flat.

26:10.046 --> 26:14.790
Doctors used to not wash
their hands before surgery,
which is very gross.

26:14.834 --> 26:16.313
We didn't even know
gravity was a thing.

26:18.533 --> 26:21.971
Even if you're right,
even if there are...

26:22.015 --> 26:23.582
aliens and superheroes,

26:27.063 --> 26:28.108
why does it have to be me?

26:29.805 --> 26:31.720
What do you mean?

26:31.764 --> 26:36.856
I'm adopted. I was always
moving around because
of my dad's job.

26:36.899 --> 26:42.122
Most of the time I was
the only Black girl in my town
or in my school.

26:42.165 --> 26:45.865
My whole life has been
about being different
and now I'm supposed to...

26:45.908 --> 26:49.390
accept the fact
that I'm literally an alien
from outer space.

26:53.350 --> 26:54.308
I just want to be normal.

26:57.050 --> 27:00.662
You are a lot of things, babe,
but normal is not one of them.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.623
You, Naomi McDuffie,
are exceptional.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.626
I'm pretty sure you're biased.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.803
No, it's a fact.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.547
So you know
the Serenity Prayer?

27:16.591 --> 27:20.377
"May I be granted the serenity
to accept the things
I cannot change,

27:20.421 --> 27:22.118
the courage to change
the things I can,

27:23.467 --> 27:25.121
and the wisdom to know
the difference."

27:27.384 --> 27:29.212
I think what it means is that

27:29.256 --> 27:32.825
there's some things in life we
can't change and that's okay.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.743
I'm scared, Annabelle.

27:39.962 --> 27:40.789
I know.

27:42.922 --> 27:43.792
And that's okay too.

27:46.490 --> 27:51.844
But denying something
doesn't make it any less real.

27:51.887 --> 27:55.978
Maybe accepting it
is the first step towards
making it less scary.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.727
More cheese.

28:07.729 --> 28:08.556
A little more.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.559
A little more.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.041
Perfect. You're a natural.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.957
The secret to Mom's pasta
is ninety percent cheese.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.480
She's right.

28:19.523 --> 28:22.657
Speaking of, I left
a grocery bag in the car.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.311
Naomi, take these bowls
to your friends.

28:27.575 --> 28:28.402
You're still here.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.579
We all are.

28:31.622 --> 28:35.322
If this UFO hunt
is important to you,
it's important to us.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.933
Also, I couldn't say no to
Mrs. McDuffie's pasta, so...

28:43.678 --> 28:45.593
Hope I'm not interrupting.

28:45.636 --> 28:46.899
Nathan, what are you
doing here?

28:46.942 --> 28:48.204
Your mom let me in.

28:48.248 --> 28:49.640
What's he doing here?

28:49.684 --> 28:51.468
You know, I'm standing
right here.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.210
Could you, um,
take these bowls
to Jacob and Annabelle?

29:02.088 --> 29:03.742
What are you doing here?

29:03.785 --> 29:05.265
Seriously?

29:05.308 --> 29:07.658
You told me to come by
after soccer practice.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.443
Oh, our project.

29:09.486 --> 29:11.401
You keep forgetting
about our project.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.968
You forgot I was coming over.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.928
And then when I show up,
all these people are here.

29:15.971 --> 29:16.798
Anthony's here?

29:18.626 --> 29:20.149
That's pretty not cool.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.543
I know.
I'm sorry. I can explain.

29:26.025 --> 29:26.895
All right.

29:31.726 --> 29:34.511
Hey, what's going on
with you, for real?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.644
Nothing.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.515
I just have a lot on my mind,
that's all.

29:39.778 --> 29:40.866
Is this about Dee?

29:40.909 --> 29:42.781
What?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.695
When we went to see him
the other day,
you seemed upset.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.397
I know we're not together,
but...

29:50.440 --> 29:51.311
I'm still your friend.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.575
You can talk to me.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.274
Naomi, you need to
come see this.

30:00.929 --> 30:03.279
Steve said the mill
was close to the creek,

30:03.323 --> 30:06.761
but none of these are
within a ten-mile radius.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.893
Maybe Steve was wrong.

30:10.939 --> 30:15.030
These are the only
operational mills
near Falls Creek.

30:17.554 --> 30:20.514
This is a Pacific Logging map.
It lists all the mills.

30:24.170 --> 30:28.174
Pacific #42
decommissioned in 1989,

30:28.217 --> 30:30.219
three miles away
from the creek.

30:30.263 --> 30:33.744
I feel like I, uh,
missed a lot.

30:33.788 --> 30:34.920
We'll catch you up on the way.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.618
I guess homework
will have to wait.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.627
Is it just me,
or is this car getting
a little crowded?

30:57.551 --> 30:58.465
Uh-oh.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.732
I knew this car was
living on borrowed time.

31:04.775 --> 31:06.603
Time to call AAA?

31:06.647 --> 31:08.040
I have a better idea.

31:13.784 --> 31:15.917
You guys are really
bad at hitchhiking.

31:15.961 --> 31:17.527
Thanks for coming, Lourdes.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.399
You know I'm always happy
to get a text from you.

31:27.711 --> 31:29.365
We have to walk
the rest of the way.

31:29.409 --> 31:31.585
It's about a mile.

31:31.628 --> 31:34.240
This is the beginning of
literally every horror movie.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.264
What the hell is this?

32:43.874 --> 32:45.572
These markings
were on the disc.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.582
Someone's coming.
Guys, we have to go.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.067
I know you're here, Naomi.

33:07.028 --> 33:08.160
And you brought your friends.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.688
Did you know someone
broke into my dealership?

33:16.385 --> 33:18.648
That's called
criminal trespassing.

33:18.692 --> 33:22.217
Police came by, asked if
I had any idea
who might have done it.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.526
I'm still deciding
on what to tell them.

33:28.919 --> 33:32.793
You all must really care
about Naomi to put
yourselves in harm's way.

33:34.795 --> 33:38.668
You can leave now,
except Naomi.

33:38.712 --> 33:40.844
- No way.
Hell no!

33:40.888 --> 33:43.456
If he thinks
we're leaving you here,
he's crazier than we thought.

33:43.499 --> 33:46.720
If I stay,
will my friends be safe?

33:46.763 --> 33:49.201
I give you my word.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.767
That does not
make me feel better.

33:50.811 --> 33:52.508
We are not leaving you
alone with a criminal

33:52.552 --> 33:54.597
who's doing creepy things
inside of a creepy mill.

33:54.641 --> 34:00.038
Annabelle, I'll be fine.
Remember? Zeus.

34:02.562 --> 34:07.045
Fine. If Naomi says to go,
we should go.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.002
We have to trust her.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.704
We'll be right outside.

34:14.748 --> 34:17.098
Aim for his eyes.

34:17.142 --> 34:18.621
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:30.764 --> 34:34.115
What do you want?
Why did you follow me here?

34:35.812 --> 34:39.120
I want you to stay out of this
before you get hurt.

35:11.935 --> 35:18.028
Impressive. Much more focused
than your display in the woods.

35:19.378 --> 35:22.468
Using those will
get you into trouble.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.078
What happened here
on March 14th?

35:27.386 --> 35:28.996
Nothing to do with you.

35:29.039 --> 35:30.476
You're lying.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.738
If you're not gonna
believe me, then why ask?

35:34.697 --> 35:38.179
What is this place?
What are those markings?

35:38.223 --> 35:39.137
Tell me what's--

35:48.972 --> 35:50.974
Stop messing with things
that you don't understand.

35:52.411 --> 35:53.716
Go, and don't ever
come back here.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.254
Anthony, wait up.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.342
Thanks again, Lourdes.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.865
Literally, anytime.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.743
Hey! Are you sure you're okay?

36:20.787 --> 36:23.137
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:23.181 --> 36:26.096
I think Zumbado was just trying
to scare us or something.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.055
Mission accomplished.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.840
What was he even doing there?
Was that payback for the
break-in?

36:31.841 --> 36:32.755
I don't know.

36:35.758 --> 36:38.718
Well...
Hey, about that pizza...

36:40.807 --> 36:41.634
I...

36:43.026 --> 36:44.637
You changed your mind.

36:47.335 --> 36:50.251
I didn't know you wanted
to get pizza like that.

36:51.687 --> 36:52.601
Oh...

36:55.300 --> 36:58.738
This is awkward.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.175
No, no, I don't want it to be.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.569
I just have a lot going on,

37:03.612 --> 37:06.311
so for right now,
could we just stay friends?

37:06.354 --> 37:09.488
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I get it.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.360
No, I don't think you do.

37:12.404 --> 37:18.453
I'm not saying no, Anthony,
I'm just saying not right now.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.241
I can live with that.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.387
What is going on here?

37:39.431 --> 37:42.303
Naomi is doing
a school project.

37:47.395 --> 37:49.876
I tracked down
that actor Dee hired,

37:49.919 --> 37:52.531
but all I got was
a full voice mailbox.

37:52.574 --> 37:53.880
So it's a dead end?

37:55.098 --> 37:57.318
It's feeling like it.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.059
Commander Steel wants
to see me first thing.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.887
He said he has
something to tell me.

38:00.930 --> 38:01.931
Do you agree with him?

38:01.975 --> 38:03.455
Is Dee some kind of threat?

38:03.498 --> 38:04.891
I don't know if he's a threat,

38:06.632 --> 38:07.937
but he's definitely
hiding something.

38:24.954 --> 38:26.216
Why are you helping me?

38:32.397 --> 38:33.876
You didn't have to
tell me the truth.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.099
Wouldn't it have just been
easier for you to stay quiet?

38:40.883 --> 38:45.235
I know what it feels like to
be different and not know why.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.458
I really wanted
you to be wrong.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.245
I know.

38:55.289 --> 39:00.250
I told myself that if I could
just prove that something else
happened on March 14th,

39:00.294 --> 39:02.688
something real,

39:02.731 --> 39:05.299
that things could just go back
to the way that they were,

39:05.343 --> 39:07.606
before Superman,
before all of this.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.261
Now I know I can't.

39:11.305 --> 39:12.959
I don't know
what is happening to me.

39:15.048 --> 39:18.094
All I know is that
it is happening.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.709
And how do you feel?

39:23.752 --> 39:26.538
Scared, confused, excited.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.279
Dee, I think I have powers.

39:32.631 --> 39:36.112
Yes, and they're actually
pretty great,

39:36.156 --> 39:37.375
once you get used to them.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.075
Could you introduce me
to Superman?

39:45.121 --> 39:48.298
Um... Maybe one day.

39:54.174 --> 39:55.436
Thank you for
telling me the truth.

39:58.657 --> 40:00.180
You're welcome.

40:00.223 --> 40:04.445
That energy thing,
it happened again,

40:04.489 --> 40:06.491
like it did in the woods
and in here with the lights.

40:08.057 --> 40:10.799
But this time,
I meant to cause it.

40:10.843 --> 40:11.713
But I couldn't control it.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.634
I think I can help with that.

40:23.551 --> 40:24.552
Welcome to the team, Major.

40:29.296 --> 40:32.212
Sir, what is a UAPTF?

40:32.255 --> 40:35.650
Unidentified Aerial Phenomena
Task Force.

40:35.694 --> 40:38.087
It was developed by
the DOD and Naval Intelligence

40:38.131 --> 40:40.960
to investigate
otherworldly threats.

40:41.003 --> 40:44.572
Otherworldly threats.
Like, uh... Like aliens?

40:44.616 --> 40:47.009
That's right.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.882
The Superman appearance was
just the latest in a long line
of mysterious incidents.

40:52.319 --> 40:54.364
So Superman's an alien?

40:54.408 --> 40:56.541
Yes.
We believe he might be.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.935
You're saying aliens are real?

40:59.979 --> 41:01.546
It's worse
than that, Major.

41:01.589 --> 41:03.504
We believe
they're already here.
