WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.436
Oh, what are you
guys doing together,

00:04.437 --> 00:05.958
Just the two of you?
We're gonna raise money

00:05.959 --> 00:07.552
On the quad to help
with the oil spill.

00:07.553 --> 00:10.481
We're making this display to
show how serious the problem is.

00:10.482 --> 00:12.703
Oh, yeah. Each drop represents

00:12.704 --> 00:15.458
10,000 gallons of oil.

00:17.339 --> 00:18.851
Ooh! Oh...

00:18.852 --> 00:20.843
I'm so glad this tragedy
overshadowed haiti.

00:20.844 --> 00:22.011
I didn't have any ideas for that.

00:22.012 --> 00:23.819
Yay to having fun in pairs!

00:23.820 --> 00:25.445
What up, party people?

00:25.446 --> 00:26.956
Oh, you got a
band-aid on your arm.

00:26.957 --> 00:28.144
You should be more
careful shaving.

00:28.145 --> 00:30.739
I wax, dummy.
This is from a blood test.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.381
Oh, no...I knew it.

00:32.383 --> 00:33.642
Things are going too well for you.

00:33.643 --> 00:35.560
Oh, no, no. Just a physical.

00:35.667 --> 00:37.558
Even a ferrari needs a tune-up.

00:38.015 --> 00:39.320
You guys moonshiners now?

00:39.321 --> 00:40.951
No, just the two of them.

00:40.952 --> 00:42.610
We're raising money
for the oil spill.

00:42.611 --> 00:43.917
Did you even know there was one?

00:43.918 --> 00:46.296
Uh, yeah, I have the
aol home page bookmarked.

00:46.297 --> 00:47.786
Did you even know
about the ostrich

00:47.787 --> 00:49.249
That raised the tiger cub?

00:51.681 --> 00:54.185
- Troy, what's wrong?
- I just saw a dead body.

00:54.833 --> 00:56.771
I told you not to use
the east stairwell.

00:56.772 --> 00:58.474
My pastor said it's meth season.

00:58.501 --> 01:00.400
You know I'm living
with Pierce now, so...

01:00.830 --> 01:02.748
This morning I went to
do laundry in the garage,

01:02.749 --> 01:05.214
And I found his mom... dead.

01:05.215 --> 01:07.832
- oh!
- Troy, that's terrible!

01:07.833 --> 01:10.276
Well, she had been in
bad shape for a while.

01:10.627 --> 01:13.340
So I guess she crawled out
there to die like a cat.

01:15.115 --> 01:16.982
I've never been that close
to a dead body before.

01:16.983 --> 01:18.577
- oh!
- Oh, pumpkin!

01:19.573 --> 01:21.441
She was so cold and gray.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.748
I saw her underwear!

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.818 --> 01:35.986
Jeez... who died?

01:35.987 --> 01:39.021
Pierce, we're so sorry
to hear about your mom.

01:39.022 --> 01:40.454
- why?
- Losing a loved one

01:40.455 --> 01:41.991
Is always difficult.

01:41.992 --> 01:44.277
What? My mom isn't dead.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.711
But when Troy found her,
he said that... 

01:45.712 --> 01:48.123
well, her heart, lungs,
kidneys, and brain

01:48.124 --> 01:49.211
Stopped working.

01:49.212 --> 01:51.694
And another way of
saying that would be...

01:51.695 --> 01:53.343
she's used up her organic body.

01:53.344 --> 01:56.539
By...dying in it.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.232
Wrong. She's alive.

02:00.233 --> 02:02.236
Mom was a part of
my buddhist church.

02:02.683 --> 02:05.020
She's a level five laser lotus,
same as me.

02:05.021 --> 02:07.291
When a level five's
body stops functioning,

02:07.292 --> 02:09.580
It's vaporized in the
temple of renewal

02:09.580 --> 02:11.991
And stored in an energon pod.

02:11.992 --> 02:14.642
In a few years,
when our technology advances,

02:14.643 --> 02:16.099
They'll extract her body vapors

02:16.100 --> 02:17.894
And recondense it
to a solid state.

02:17.895 --> 02:18.959
And before you know it,

02:18.960 --> 02:22.566
Mom'll be back in the kitchen
making Troy and me sandwiches.

02:23.767 --> 02:24.662
Ha.

02:27.365 --> 02:29.769
Pumpkin! It's okay!

02:33.612 --> 02:35.914
Did you guys hear about
that turtle in china?

02:36.521 --> 02:38.125
Two packs a day.

02:39.144 --> 02:42.266
* give me some rope,
time in a tree

02:42.267 --> 02:45.462
Give me the hope
to run out of steam

02:45.541 --> 02:48.860
Somebody said we could be here

02:48.921 --> 02:52.969
We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

02:52.970 --> 02:57.112
I can't count the
reasons I should stay

02:57.948 --> 03:02.472
One by one they all just fade away

03:02.893 --> 03:06.913
Sync by YYeTs.net

03:09.897 --> 03:11.615
look, if you guys just let
me get to the can opener,

03:11.616 --> 03:12.664
I can feed you.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.993
We have to do
something about Pierce.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.090
He really thinks
his mom isn't dead.

03:16.261 --> 03:18.012
He's gone crazy.

03:18.189 --> 03:19.043
-...er?

03:19.044 --> 03:21.296
He won't even let us
have a memorial service.

03:21.552 --> 03:23.149
I was halfway done
with the collage.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.822
He hasn't cried yet,
and from what I've been told,

03:24.823 --> 03:27.279
That's not normal.
Who's normal, Abed?

03:27.280 --> 03:29.299
Well, baptists are,
but that's beside the point.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.635
Everybody has some sort of
service for the departed... 

03:31.636 --> 03:34.067
Eskimos, witch doctors,
jewish people.

03:34.068 --> 03:35.346
Oh, cool. We made the list.

03:35.347 --> 03:38.034
The point being,
death needs to be coped with,

03:38.035 --> 03:40.145
Not ignored, otherwise,
why did mankind

03:40.146 --> 03:41.830
Concoct all these religions?

03:41.831 --> 03:44.863
- you wanna rephrase that?
- Oh, I'm sorry... humankind.

03:44.864 --> 03:45.958
You think you're real smart,
don't you?

03:45.959 --> 03:48.329
Guys, guys, guys.
Did we learn nothing

03:48.330 --> 03:49.566
From last christmas?

03:49.610 --> 03:51.873
I don't see much difference
between Pierce's religion

03:51.874 --> 03:53.029
And anybody else's.

03:53.030 --> 03:54.027
Well, then you're not listening,

03:54.028 --> 03:55.582
Because his has lasers.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.389
Look, you guys make fun of me
for not caring about religion,

03:58.390 --> 04:00.782
But at least I'm dedicated
enough to not caring

04:00.783 --> 04:03.102
To let you have your own beliefs.

04:04.232 --> 04:05.604
Can't Pierce have his?

04:06.464 --> 04:07.926
Can't you be cool like me?

04:09.676 --> 04:10.497
Hello?

04:10.805 --> 04:12.915
He ends so many of
his speeches that way.

04:14.209 --> 04:16.761
- morning, guys.
- Morning, Pierce.

04:17.077 --> 04:18.968
How's mom? - terrific.

04:18.969 --> 04:21.108
Her body's being
vaporized as we speak.

04:21.166 --> 04:22.665
What does that feel like?

04:22.666 --> 04:24.170
They say it's the
greatest feeling ever.

04:24.171 --> 04:27.375
Like the second when the fudge
on your sunday is still hot

04:27.376 --> 04:30.380
Or when you're the first one
to break in a new boob job.

04:30.381 --> 04:33.096
Also, you're free from the
burden of your earthly body.

04:33.097 --> 04:34.155
It is a burden.

04:34.156 --> 04:37.155
Greetings, class! I am dr.
Ian duncan.

04:37.156 --> 04:39.948
Now, I don't normally
teach anthropology,

04:39.949 --> 04:43.283
But apparently professor bauer
tried to strangle mr. Winger

04:43.389 --> 04:45.790
And has been put on
administrative leave with pay.

04:45.791 --> 04:50.161
So...what is anthropology?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.904
Seriously, does anyone know?

04:55.597 --> 04:58.573
- you, in the boobs.
- It's the study of humanity.

04:58.678 --> 04:59.606
Wow!

05:00.259 --> 05:02.866
Wow. I thought
psychology was a racket.

05:03.847 --> 05:05.246
Well, well.

05:06.309 --> 05:08.645
I heard there was a drunk limey

05:08.646 --> 05:09.864
Teachin' this class.

05:09.865 --> 05:11.892
I'm not actually drunk,
and I can prove it.

05:11.893 --> 05:14.362
I blew beneath the legal
limit just this morning.

05:14.363 --> 05:15.404
That's reassuring.

05:15.405 --> 05:17.369
Also, I would like
everyone here to know

05:17.370 --> 05:20.149
That this man assaulted
me last year.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.121
And I have a restraining order

05:22.122 --> 05:24.983
So I can have him expelled
if he comes within...

05:24.984 --> 05:26.562
25...

05:26.633 --> 05:27.675
feet.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.728
- Abed.
- Yep.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.756
Proceed, dr. Teeth.

05:43.055 --> 05:47.678
It is the single largest
disaster in recorded history.

05:47.679 --> 05:51.204
It is worse than 50
exxon valdez spills!

05:51.205 --> 05:52.980
You don't have to yell at us.

05:52.982 --> 05:55.654
Nobody is on the other
side of this issue.

05:56.760 --> 05:59.216
And the pelicans
are covered in oil.

05:59.217 --> 06:01.803
Everyone likes pelicans.
They bring babies.

06:01.922 --> 06:04.140
- that's storks.
- Oh, right.

06:04.153 --> 06:06.533
Well...we still like them!

06:07.432 --> 06:08.691
Yeah, we do. Um...

06:09.012 --> 06:10.244
I'm gonna give you...

06:10.827 --> 06:12.713
Another 20. - oh!

06:12.833 --> 06:14.947
Thank you so much!

06:18.188 --> 06:19.701
I'm here for my test results...

06:19.954 --> 06:21.674
If you haven't framed them yet.

06:22.173 --> 06:23.850
- Hi, gorgeous.
- Jeff.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.076
You have something
very infectious.

06:26.383 --> 06:27.838
What? - charm!

06:28.848 --> 06:30.138
You got me, jackie.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.163
Seriously,
everything looks great.

06:32.164 --> 06:33.672
You're an incredible specimen.

06:33.673 --> 06:36.026
Even your moles look
like little hearts.

06:36.207 --> 06:37.471
The only thing I would suggest... 

06:37.472 --> 06:39.141
Go see a doctor and
get a prescription

06:39.142 --> 06:41.043
For cholesterol medication.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.451
Your cholesterol's
a little high.

06:44.452 --> 06:46.563
It's no big deal.
Eat some egg whites.

06:46.564 --> 06:48.625
But I-I don't understand.

06:48.626 --> 06:51.382
Wait, did I accidentally
tell you you have aids?

06:51.383 --> 06:52.504
'cause I've done that before.

06:52.505 --> 06:53.605
- it doesn't... I mean-
- It doesn't... 

06:53.606 --> 06:55.235
I treat my body like a temple!

06:55.236 --> 06:57.282
Well, I can't be the
first person to tell you

06:57.283 --> 06:59.355
That the temple
doesn't last forever.

06:59.407 --> 07:01.022
I mean, it's made of hamburger.

07:01.023 --> 07:03.291
This is a... this
is a temple of doom.

07:03.430 --> 07:05.439
And you know what?
Like the real temple of doom,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.435
It represents the
inconvenient fact

07:07.436 --> 07:08.720
That all good things... 

07:08.721 --> 07:11.338
Be they people or
movie franchises... 

07:11.339 --> 07:14.446
Eventually collapse
into sagging, sloppy,

07:14.447 --> 07:16.948
Rotten piles of hard
to follow nonsense.

07:17.442 --> 07:18.651
I need to be alone.

07:21.217 --> 07:23.540
Uh...you can do that by leaving.

07:28.159 --> 07:29.539
Whoo. Okay.

07:29.681 --> 07:30.791
Let's get goin'!

07:30.976 --> 07:32.927
Those paps aren't gonna
smear themselves.

07:33.862 --> 07:37.742
There is no god!

07:37.994 --> 07:40.367
Tell us how you really feel.
Am I right?

07:48.662 --> 07:49.602
Morning, Jeff.

07:49.603 --> 07:50.890
Did you get the results
of your blood test?

07:50.891 --> 07:52.908
- I'm fine.
- I figured.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.541
Thank you for wising
us up yesterday.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.867
We were being judgmental
about Pierce's religion.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.032
But the fact is, jesus... 

07:59.033 --> 08:01.131
the fact is, everyone's dying.

08:02.143 --> 08:03.452
And we all have
these little notions

08:03.453 --> 08:04.581
That we're the exception,

08:04.582 --> 08:06.654
But we're as wrong as we are dead.

08:10.867 --> 08:11.995
That's nice.

08:15.089 --> 08:16.958
How's it going with the
little side project

08:16.959 --> 08:18.764
That just the two
of you are doing?

08:18.765 --> 08:21.863
It's great. I made $236,

08:21.864 --> 08:23.038
Plus Britta's makes... 

08:23.039 --> 08:26.383
Well, all totaled,
we're close to 250, right, Britta?

08:27.265 --> 08:29.084
Greendale cares
about this issue.

08:29.085 --> 08:30.749
Yeah. I don't think that's it.

08:30.838 --> 08:32.597
- what do you mean?
- Come on, annie.

08:32.597 --> 08:33.828
You know guys are giving you money

08:33.830 --> 08:36.529
Because of the whole
sexy schoolgirl routine.

08:36.908 --> 08:38.847
- I have a routine?
- Yeah.

08:38.849 --> 08:41.676
You know, the one where you
use posture as an excuse

08:41.677 --> 08:42.903
To stick out your chest

08:42.904 --> 08:45.169
And you laugh at
guys' unfunny jokes,

08:45.170 --> 08:46.298
Pretending not to know

08:46.299 --> 08:48.812
That they have a sock at
home with your name on it.

08:49.603 --> 08:52.297
Um...that's me,

08:52.631 --> 08:54.576
And if a guy wants to
make a puppet of me,

08:54.577 --> 08:56.124
That's hardly your concern.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.991
Well, I just may
be an outsider here

08:57.992 --> 08:59.972
Because I was never
called to participate,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.962
But it seems to me
that Britta's upset

09:01.963 --> 09:04.482
Because she's raising
less money than you.

09:04.483 --> 09:05.669
Yeah, I'm raising less money

09:05.670 --> 09:08.260
Because I'm not
jump-starting date rapists.

09:09.973 --> 09:10.996
Bitter much?

09:10.997 --> 09:12.844
Say "Bitter much" Much?

09:12.845 --> 09:16.558
Say say "Bitter much much" Much?

09:20.737 --> 09:23.145
It's not my fault.
I used to wear a back brace.

09:23.292 --> 09:24.282
That's why.

09:25.868 --> 09:27.274
What's with the lava lamp?

09:28.901 --> 09:31.138
It's not a lava lamp.
It's my mom.

09:31.139 --> 09:32.782
Ha ho ho! Snap!

09:33.170 --> 09:34.172
Wait...what?

09:34.173 --> 09:36.778
The temple finished
vaporizing her.

09:36.933 --> 09:38.813
This is mom's energon pod.

09:39.524 --> 09:41.411
And that's her vapor in
those little bubbles.

09:41.412 --> 09:43.131
I'm sure that thing
was free, right?

09:43.132 --> 09:45.240
Energon doesn't
grow on trees, Jeff.

09:45.241 --> 09:48.275
It's harvested by super bees
in a buddhist meteor crater.

09:48.276 --> 09:49.898
Which is at the
foot of mount sky mall

09:49.899 --> 09:51.498
In the sharper image valley?

09:52.226 --> 09:53.850
Sorry, I overslept.

09:53.851 --> 09:56.630
The sidewalk is more
comfortable than it looks.

09:56.631 --> 09:58.762
Drunk. Glug, glug, glug.

09:58.763 --> 10:01.252
Shut up. So where did
we get to yesterday?

10:01.253 --> 10:02.661
You are drunk and stupid.

10:02.662 --> 10:05.067
Actually, ben, I do have
a wee big of a headache,

10:05.068 --> 10:06.294
So if you could just... 

10:11.735 --> 10:13.790
Isn't that interesting?

10:13.791 --> 10:15.491
I have a right to be here, sir.

10:15.513 --> 10:16.770
Oh, you do, you do,

10:16.771 --> 10:20.384
And I do hope you have
very good hearing.

10:22.234 --> 10:23.347
Bastard!

10:25.243 --> 10:27.480
So, where did we
get to yesterday?

10:27.481 --> 10:29.176
We were talking about humanity,

10:29.177 --> 10:32.872
Which starts with birth
and ends with death.

10:32.873 --> 10:33.734
True.

10:33.735 --> 10:36.409
All life ends in death,
which we, as a species,

10:36.410 --> 10:39.547
Are cursed with knowing,
resulting in...

10:40.929 --> 10:43.193
Something.

10:43.808 --> 10:46.638
Again, this is
really not my field.

10:46.639 --> 10:48.479
Professor, what would you say

10:48.480 --> 10:50.184
Might be the difference between

10:50.185 --> 10:52.826
A religion and...A cult?

10:52.827 --> 10:55.037
Why don't we open that
question to the floor,

10:55.038 --> 10:56.081
Since I don't know

10:56.082 --> 10:58.051
And the book for this
class is expensive?

10:58.052 --> 11:00.720
Well, I would say a cult might,
for instance,

11:00.721 --> 11:03.228
Sell you a tube of jell-o

11:03.415 --> 11:06.196
And tell you your mother is in it.

11:06.197 --> 11:08.517
- Jeffrey!
- I see... are we thinly veiling

11:08.518 --> 11:10.487
A personal conflict and
passing it off as a lesson?

11:10.488 --> 11:12.127
'cause if so, please continue.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.216
Reformed neo-buddhism
is not a cult!

11:15.217 --> 11:17.244
It is a new way of
looking at the world,

11:17.245 --> 11:18.884
Emphasizing empowerment.

11:19.076 --> 11:21.255
- like a video game?
- Yes, Troy.

11:21.256 --> 11:22.656
Very much like a video game.

11:22.738 --> 11:24.768
You gain levels,
and at a certain point,

11:24.769 --> 11:27.310
You actually can eat a ghost.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.184
What? I wanna eat a ghost!

11:29.185 --> 11:31.525
No. No, do not let
him pollute your brain

11:31.526 --> 11:32.635
With this crap, Troy.

11:32.636 --> 11:35.533
- it's okay to ask questions.
- I have a question.

11:35.534 --> 11:37.739
You said your mother went
from a solid to a vapor.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.674
Do people in your religion
ever take liquid form,

11:39.675 --> 11:40.687
Like the creatures in the abyss

11:40.688 --> 11:41.837
Or children's tylenol?

11:42.379 --> 11:43.330
That's a good question.

11:43.331 --> 11:45.895
Actually, when buddha returns,

11:45.896 --> 11:47.400
We all take liquid form

11:47.401 --> 11:50.913
And merge into a shimmering
ocean of knowledge.

11:51.342 --> 11:54.473
Which, according to scripture,
tastes like hawaiian punch.

11:54.474 --> 11:56.691
I do like hawaiian punch.

11:56.692 --> 11:57.705
Hey, if you're really curious,

11:57.706 --> 11:59.861
Come to my church's
open hive tomorrow.

11:59.862 --> 12:02.981
You know, wine, beer,
free credit checks.

12:02.982 --> 12:04.571
How much wine and
beer per person?

12:04.572 --> 12:06.581
- oh, come on!
- We're having a con... what?

12:06.582 --> 12:09.099
Excuse me.
Is this anesthesiology?

12:09.970 --> 12:11.742
Yes. Yes, it is.

12:11.743 --> 12:12.912
Just go with this.

12:13.038 --> 12:15.643
It's really sad. Anything helps.

12:15.644 --> 12:17.640
So just anything you
could give would be... 

12:23.118 --> 12:24.150
hey!

12:24.151 --> 12:27.138
I like need you to
save the pelicans.

12:27.139 --> 12:29.590
They're all feathery and pelicany.

12:29.591 --> 12:31.478
I wuv them.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.679
Thank you!

12:36.628 --> 12:39.381
Wow. It really is
easy to raise money

12:39.382 --> 12:40.942
When you sell out your gender.

12:42.112 --> 12:43.409
I'm sure it's even easier

12:43.410 --> 12:45.263
When you're not
standing next to this.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.593
Hey, jerk! You're stupid!

12:47.594 --> 12:49.230
Gimme money. I know more than you.

12:49.231 --> 12:51.200
Oh, I don't know anything.

12:51.201 --> 12:52.856
I need boys.

12:52.857 --> 12:55.311
Saving the planet
makes my back hurt.

12:55.312 --> 12:57.354
Oh, I obviously don't
need guys for anything.

12:57.355 --> 13:00.041
That's why I wear stripper
boots during the day

13:00.042 --> 13:02.181
And eat only celery
and mustard for lunch!

13:02.182 --> 13:05.154
- oh, I never stop smiling.
- I never start!

13:05.155 --> 13:07.090
My sweaters keep shrinking!

13:07.091 --> 13:10.872
I get up an hour early to
ever-so-slightly curl my hair.

13:16.341 --> 13:18.449
Yeah, you're both so different.

13:18.450 --> 13:19.740
Skinny bitches.

13:19.761 --> 13:21.680
Hello, billionaire boys club.

13:22.639 --> 13:24.584
Mind if I ask what
happened in class today?

13:24.585 --> 13:27.283
You pulled 40 minutes of
anesthesiology out of your ass.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.452
Yeah, I did.

13:28.735 --> 13:31.172
But, uh, I meant
your elderly friend.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.828
Do you know how many times
I haven't eaten a donut?

13:35.829 --> 13:37.567
- I do not.
- How much I got teased

13:37.568 --> 13:40.134
In grade school for dabbing
my pizza with napkins?

13:40.699 --> 13:41.723
I've suffered.

13:42.127 --> 13:43.828
I've denied myself. - mm-hmm.

13:43.829 --> 13:46.064
Because the rules
said if I did that,

13:46.065 --> 13:47.543
I would live longer.

13:47.544 --> 13:49.562
But then, halfway
through the game,

13:49.728 --> 13:53.090
I get this little update that
it doesn't matter what I do.

13:53.156 --> 13:54.765
I could eat powdered
bran every day

13:54.766 --> 13:56.239
While you suck down figgy pudding,

13:56.240 --> 13:58.267
And I still might die first.

13:58.640 --> 14:01.692
It's unfair!
I want my donuts back.

14:01.836 --> 14:05.350
Well, I think you're being
a little childish, and... 

14:06.389 --> 14:08.133
Hold on a sec.
I need to use my force field

14:08.134 --> 14:09.744
To prevent chang
from getting food.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.339
Where were we? Look...

14:42.379 --> 14:45.158
The way I see it, while
claiming to have no religion,

14:45.159 --> 14:47.897
You were actually devoutly
worshipping yourself.

14:47.898 --> 14:50.499
And now that your god
has high cholesterol,

14:50.860 --> 14:53.185
You're trying to kick
Pierce's in the balls.

14:55.950 --> 14:56.909
You're right.

14:57.005 --> 15:00.323
All I've been trying to
do is crush Pierce's faith

15:00.324 --> 15:01.938
To feel better about dying.

15:01.939 --> 15:02.866
And...

15:02.928 --> 15:04.886
and now that I realize
that that was my goal...

15:04.887 --> 15:05.756
mm-hmm?

15:06.263 --> 15:08.567
I can really roll up my sleeves

15:08.568 --> 15:09.530
And get it done.

15:09.531 --> 15:10.809
- there it is.
- Thank you!

15:10.810 --> 15:11.794
You're welcome.

15:12.323 --> 15:15.495
No, that wasn't what I-
actually, I don't care.

15:18.199 --> 15:19.983
He girls,
guess who found buddha.

15:19.984 --> 15:21.011
- hey.
- Hi.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.047
We're on our way to
Pierce's buddhist open hive.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.082
But first I'm taking these
fellows for ice cream

15:26.083 --> 15:28.792
As an apology for
questioning Pierce's faith.

15:28.837 --> 15:31.531
Pierce says there's this
69th flavor I need to try.

15:31.532 --> 15:32.818
I am excited.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.495
Hey, guys, my car's over there.

15:34.739 --> 15:35.539
Cool.

15:36.404 --> 15:37.284
Guess what.

15:37.766 --> 15:39.504
I'm not actually taking
them for ice cream.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.648
I am taking them to
the county morgue

15:41.649 --> 15:43.870
Where I have confirmed
that Pierce's mother's

15:43.871 --> 15:45.698
Very un-vaporized corpse

15:45.699 --> 15:48.079
Will be lying on a
stainless steel slab

15:48.080 --> 15:49.233
For all to see.

15:49.234 --> 15:51.804
Surprise! Welcome to reality.

15:51.805 --> 15:53.048
Welcome to death.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.482
- have fun.
- Good luck.

15:54.925 --> 15:55.904
Wow.

15:56.181 --> 15:57.760
You guys are real downers.

15:57.795 --> 15:59.414
I can't believe I made
out with both of you.

15:59.932 --> 16:00.838
Ugh.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.421
I'll check the basket.

16:04.142 --> 16:05.245
Sorry.

16:05.246 --> 16:07.029
I almost arched my back a little.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.346
I know you hate that.

16:08.347 --> 16:10.980
No, I should count it.
Since I'm a calculating bitch.

16:10.981 --> 16:12.536
No, I should, since I'm the one

16:12.537 --> 16:14.219
Who's whoring out our gender!

16:14.220 --> 16:15.978
Give that back to me.
I'm gonna count it!

16:15.979 --> 16:17.758
Let go! - gimme that!

16:25.633 --> 16:27.190
Oh, yeah? Think this is funny?

16:27.191 --> 16:29.194
You think it's funny?
Get off of me!

16:29.195 --> 16:31.696
You little brat! - oh!

16:33.831 --> 16:34.863
I hate you!

16:35.581 --> 16:38.208
Now, this is why
I came to america.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.276
Maybe we should
listen to some music.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.551
No problem.

16:42.678 --> 16:44.661
I brought the jam book
from the Pierce mobile.

16:44.662 --> 16:46.035
I could play some
of the old stuff,

16:46.036 --> 16:47.575
But you guys would make fun of me.

16:48.613 --> 16:49.393
So...

16:49.590 --> 16:53.036
I'll throw ya...A bone
and put in some loggins.

16:53.037 --> 16:54.740
This ice cream place is far.

16:54.804 --> 16:56.800
Trust me. It's worth it.

16:57.957 --> 16:59.030
What's this?

16:59.031 --> 17:00.535
This is mom's handwriting.

17:00.734 --> 17:03.001
Is that what you were
doing in the garage,

17:03.002 --> 17:04.121
You silly goose?

17:04.122 --> 17:08.579
She spent her last
moments alive making a cd?

17:09.204 --> 17:10.974
That's gangster!

17:11.247 --> 17:14.281
Pierce, you found the CD,

17:14.282 --> 17:16.696
Which means...i'm dead.

17:16.698 --> 17:17.424
Vaporized.

17:17.425 --> 17:20.903
I'm not vaporized.
I'm gone, Pierce.

17:21.284 --> 17:23.057
Gone forever and...

17:23.810 --> 17:25.679
That's how I like it.

17:26.819 --> 17:30.781
Life is only worth a
damn because it's short.

17:31.225 --> 17:34.685
It's designed to
be consumed, used,

17:34.686 --> 17:38.146
spent, lived, felt.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.658
We're supposed to fill
it with every mistake

17:40.659 --> 17:43.244
And miracle we can manage.

17:43.590 --> 17:46.489
And then we're supposed to let go.

17:46.759 --> 17:50.730
I can't force you to do
that for yourself, Pierce.

17:51.077 --> 17:54.364
But you can't force me to stay.

17:54.653 --> 17:58.096
And if you unscrew the
top of that stupid thing,

17:58.097 --> 18:00.628
You'll see it was made in china.

18:01.170 --> 18:02.401
I love you, son.

18:03.275 --> 18:04.410
Good-bye.

18:05.499 --> 18:07.489
I'll play myself out.

18:16.106 --> 18:17.095
Whew.

18:17.217 --> 18:18.596
Well, that proves one thing.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.890
That woman was really
losing her marbles

18:21.948 --> 18:23.100
Toward the end.

18:28.287 --> 18:31.475
You...seriously still
think she's in there?

18:31.476 --> 18:32.569
Why wouldn't I?

18:36.336 --> 18:37.359
No reason.

18:41.489 --> 18:43.641
So...where's this
ice cream place?

18:43.642 --> 18:45.806
- yeah.
- Oh...um...

18:45.998 --> 18:48.267
You know, the... I think I...

18:48.294 --> 18:49.986
Actually saw a better
one back there.

18:49.987 --> 18:53.665
The place I was gonna take you was...
kinda depressing.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.029
Oh, can we get a little more
sawdust on that storm gutter?

18:59.030 --> 19:00.071
Thank you!

19:02.620 --> 19:04.419
I'm sorry... - I'm sorry too.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.110
I just got jealous of you.

19:06.111 --> 19:08.242
No, but you totally called
me on what I was doing,

19:08.243 --> 19:10.475
And... I only kissed Jeff

19:10.476 --> 19:11.765
Because I wanted to
see if I could do it

19:11.766 --> 19:13.983
Because I wanna be
cool and sexy like you.

19:13.984 --> 19:15.464
I can't believe how gross I am.

19:15.465 --> 19:17.917
I only slept with Jeff
because I hate myself,

19:17.918 --> 19:20.029
And that's why I got after
you for raising money.

19:20.030 --> 19:21.513
I'm twice as gross.

19:21.514 --> 19:23.585
And you know the reason

19:23.586 --> 19:26.605
That we raised more money in
five minutes of oil wrestling

19:26.606 --> 19:28.473
Than we did in two
days of fundraising?

19:28.474 --> 19:30.586
Because... men are even grosser?

19:30.587 --> 19:33.394
And when we forget that,
they win.

19:37.598 --> 19:38.775
Yeah. All right.

19:38.776 --> 19:40.008
All right, all right.

19:40.671 --> 19:41.860
Yeah, do it.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.902
Oh, so you got actual ice cream.

19:43.903 --> 19:46.124
Yeah. With peanut
butter and hot fudge.

19:46.404 --> 19:49.108
What the hell,
right? Nobody lives forever.

19:49.707 --> 19:50.718
No offense.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.080
Nah, think what you want.
It's a free country.

19:53.534 --> 19:55.376
I barely saw you this week, Abed.

19:55.377 --> 19:56.622
What have you been up to?

19:57.510 --> 19:58.843
- not much.

I filed against you
