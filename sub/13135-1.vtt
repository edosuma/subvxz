13:20.925 --> 13:22.718
Not for me. I'm losing.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.923
- Put some clothes on.
- Morning? It's 3:30 p.m.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.849
Nice tux, Ed.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.309
It's your mother's idea.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.520
She got me a gig with a wedding band.
That's what my career's down to.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.648
Can I borrow $50?
I need my car fixed.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.900
- Sure.
- That's for food.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.986
This is what I'm talking about.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.613
Richard, how about
working for a living?

13:43.614 --> 13:46.533
- Only coloreds live on welfare.
- Mind your own business.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.453
I gotta sing for $75
and he gets $50? No.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.330
Twenty dollars.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.748
And you should make
him work the game.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.294
All right. But he's not
working. Ritchie, take $20.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.705
- I'm out.
- MAN: Got anything to drink?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.800
Thanks, Ma.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.803
- ED: Ritchie.
- What?

14:06.804 --> 14:09.348
Hear about them kids that
got shot? You know 'em?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.268
- What kids?
- Bad thing. Real bad thing.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.063

MAN: I've been buying The Post
and The Daily News all week.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.799
It would be nice to see some money.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.552
JOE: You got some balls. You
should be paying us to stand here.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.347
- MAN: I've spent a lot of money.
- JOE: Come on.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.388
Shut the fuck up. Listen to this.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.354
"Although police officials
declined to discuss the note,

14:57.355 --> 15:01.316

15:06.030 --> 15:07.114
You look all right, Vin.

15:07.115 --> 15:10.659
- Anthony, do I look pale?
- You look like mozzarella.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.202
Real fucking funny.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.705
Holy shit! Look. They got
a map of the killings.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.582
- There's our neighborhood.
- Layton Avenue.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.036
- We're famous.
- Let me see that.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.589
I'd lay 5-to-1 the
killer's from right here.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.258
You think so?

15:26.259 --> 15:29.010
Don't you think we'd notice
a sicko? Come on.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.012
What do you think makes
them sickos, you idiot?

15:31.013 --> 15:32.514
You don't notice him.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.474
You think this was random?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.268
You think he just
pulled off the highway?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.979
This place is hard to
find. He knew it.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.398
- I need another 'lude.
- You just popped it.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.859
- It's not working for me.
- Give it a minute.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.026
Don't be fucking cheap.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.696
That was heavy shit you saw.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.532
I'd be freaking out if I were you.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.701
Especially since the
killer knows you saw him.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.704
- What do you mean?
- He might think you're a witness.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.706
I saw it on the news.

15:57.707 --> 16:00.417

- See who comes by.

I swear I only saw victims.
Fuck you.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.680

start spreading that shit.

16:13.681 --> 16:16.430

Leave him alone.

That's real funny.
You're fucking funny.

- What's the matter? Can't take a joke?
- No, I can't!

Here, come on.

Go home and get some sleep.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.531
Relax.

One 'lude won't work on him.

and leave him alone.

creature crawling out of the bay.

- What have you got?

Live lobsters. Two dollars each.

They'll shoot you.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.845

You shoot two people?

- These are broke.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.933

16:57.934 --> 16:59.893
They're good lobsters.
Two dollars each.

- Yeah.

What the hell happened to you?
Look at this freak.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.455
Nice outfit. Is it off the dead?

Don't vampires come out at night?

17:23.501 --> 17:26.500

What's happening, guys?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.006
Don't give us that bullshit.

looking like a fucking freak,

17:31.676 --> 17:32.801
sounding like a British fag.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.386
We're supposed to be okay with it?

17:34.387 --> 17:37.430
Fucking right. How's
your wife and kids?

17:37.431 --> 17:39.808
We're divorced. I'm
back with my mother.

- Go and OD. Go fuck yourself.
- Shut up!

whole fucking bag!

17:46.857 --> 17:49.317
All right. Here.

Here's your $5.
Get the fuck out of here.

What do you want? I got nickels.

heard about the killer?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.035
Yeah, I heard.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.670
What's the matter, Vin?
Not gonna say hello?

18:08.671 --> 18:09.872
Hello.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.881
Where the fuck were you last night?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.050
You drove past me outside the club.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.721
Drop that stupid accent
and talk to me for real.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.015
All right.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.517
So why didn't you
come in to say hello?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.477
I wasn't dressed for disco dancing.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.813
"I wasn't dressed
for disco dancing."

18:26.814 --> 18:29.357
Look at this jerk-off. He
was dressed for Halloween.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.692
VINNY: Leave him alone.

18:30.693 --> 18:34.904
Porcupine. Vinny saw the
dead bodies last night.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.733
- You saw the bodies?
- Yeah, I saw the bodies.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.369
I was on my way home
but I didn't see him.

18:41.370 --> 18:45.291
I didn't see him, you numbnuts,
so don't spread that around.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.922
ANTHONY: Here comes Ruby the skank.

18:56.218 --> 19:00.048
Yeah, but I thought you said
your parents were in Hawaii.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.429
First Europe, then Hawaii.

19:05.227 --> 19:08.806
You know, Ron, we've been
dating for three weeks.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.400
All you ever do is
take me to motels.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.614
You wanna see me again, you
introduce me to your parents.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.658
Must you always bring
up my parents?

19:19.659 --> 19:22.203
- You're getting out?
- I gotta go.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.289
What about our weekend
in the Catskills?

19:25.956 --> 19:30.251
- I already paid for the room.
- You can go there and jerk off.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.420
That's what you are,
a real jerk-off!

19:32.421 --> 19:34.255
Fuck you, you dago wop skank.

- This doesn't concern you.

Shut your fucking mouth.

- Go back home, pretty boy!

20:00.282 --> 20:02.701
He ain't showing his
face around here again.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.907
Ruby, come over here. I'm horny.
I mean, lonely. I need a hug.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.832
Then go home to your mother.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.542
Twat you say? I cunt hear.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.711
I have an infucktion in my ear.

20:12.712 --> 20:16.337
Don't you assholes ever grow up?
What the fuck is your problem?

20:16.674 --> 20:17.841
RITCHIE: Ruby!

20:17.842 --> 20:19.801
- Is that Ritchie?
- That freak don't want you.

20:19.802 --> 20:22.470
Shut the fuck up, idiot.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.844
Ritchie how are you?

20:25.683 --> 20:28.306
How you doing? You look good.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.519
Good enough to eat?

20:29.520 --> 20:32.143
I like the new look.
What, it's punk?

20:33.107 --> 20:36.860
You should come to the city
sometime. Check out the band.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.154
They suck really good.
Just like you.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.489
I learned from your mother, dick.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.158
You let your sister talk like that?

20:43.159 --> 20:45.032
Come on. Get lost.

20:47.037 --> 20:50.081
- You live in Manhattan now?
- As of last night.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.374
I got evicted.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.795
- Stop talking like that.
- You been in London, too?

20:55.379 --> 20:58.002
No, but it's all in the attitude.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.835
- All in the attitude.
- In the attitude.

21:01.552 --> 21:05.513
I gotta go. My father's
gonna kill me. See you.

21:05.514 --> 21:09.264
- It was great seeing you.
- Yeah, you too. You look good.

21:09.810 --> 21:12.896
Take care of yourself, Ruby.

21:12.897 --> 21:16.727
Ritchie, I wanna talk to you.
Take it easy on the rebound.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.729
Whoa, whoa.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.732
Trying to knock me down?

21:22.823 --> 21:24.366
RITCHIE: Whoa. Slow down.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.496
VINNY: Don't tell nobody.
It's between you and me.

21:29.497 --> 21:32.120
It's bad enough that I balled her.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.960
But some sick side of me had
to drive Dionna past the spot

21:35.961 --> 21:39.085
where I was sticking it
up her cousin's ass.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.134
That's where I saw the
dead bodies. Right there.

21:43.135 --> 21:47.260
You know what? God spared me.
He spared me, man.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.809
It's a fucking omen. I'm serious.
He let me go, man.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.763
What the fuck could this mean?

21:53.979 --> 21:55.772
What do you think it means?

21:55.773 --> 21:57.357
I don't know. What do
you think it means?

21:57.358 --> 21:58.733
I think God's telling me

21:58.734 --> 22:02.063
I'm gonna burn in hell if
I don't stop cheating.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.444
Didn't I say you weren't
ready to get married?

22:08.118 --> 22:09.369
You don't fucking listen.

22:09.370 --> 22:12.288
I fucking thought I would stop
cheating when I got married.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.459
I'm cheating a lot
more than I ever did.

22:17.211 --> 22:19.546
But I thought the man
up there understood.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.256
VINNY: I thought he'd understand.

22:21.257 --> 22:25.758
- God has got nothing to do with this.
- Come on, Ritchie. Yes, he does.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.179
God is telling me,

22:28.180 --> 22:31.725
"You shouldn't be doing these
things with your wife."

22:31.851 --> 22:34.310
- What things?
- Don't be stupid.

22:34.311 --> 22:39.688
You know butt-fucking,
69, doggy-style.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.027
That's the message from God.
"Cut that shit out.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.947
"You gotta cut it out, or I'm
not gonna spare you next time."

22:45.948 --> 22:48.283
That's what God's telling me.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.988
I'm telling you. I think the
guy saw my license plate.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.038
He's after me.

22:54.039 --> 22:56.124
I'm gonna be number
eight. My life is over.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.292
You don't gotta worry about that.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.587
Don't worry about any omen.

23:00.588 --> 23:03.882
What the fuck am I gonna do?
What if I can't stop?

23:03.883 --> 23:06.467
What if I got some sort of hang-up?

23:06.468 --> 23:08.170
You don't got any hang-ups.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.639
Once you've deviated, you
can't go back. You know that.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.435
Tell Dionna you like these
things and maybe she'll do it.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.896
- You don't do that shit with your wife.
- Why not?

23:17.897 --> 23:19.647
It's a fucking sin.

23:19.648 --> 23:23.484
RITCHIE: "Oh, please, can I put
it up your ass? Just one time?"

23:23.485 --> 23:25.858
Don't fucking make fun of me.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.156
- "I'm gonna put it up your ass."
- Shut up.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.700
"Dionna!"

23:31.744 --> 23:34.413
What do you want me to say?
Get a divorce.

23:34.580 --> 23:37.790
Divorce is evil. You
got some bad advice.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.664
"Evil" spelled backwards is "live."

23:40.169 --> 23:42.872
You're a corny fuck. You know that?

23:43.756 --> 23:46.841
Dionna, I gotta talk to you.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.344
What are you doing here?

23:49.345 --> 23:51.179
I gotta talk to you for a minute.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.553
Now? Honey, we're in trouble.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.643
We got Luigi here and
we're not ready.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.562
Come on. Sit down there.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.023
What's wrong?

36:18.677 --> 36:20.928
I didn't see anybody.
Remember that.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.348
Okay. Thanks for the haircut.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.764
(WHISPERING) Use it.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.891
- See you, Ruby.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.782
Congratulations. You just
realized you're married.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.157
I'm trying.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.985
Does Gloria need a shampoo girl?

36:44.119 --> 36:46.413
Gloria, you need a shampoo girl?

36:46.621 --> 36:47.947
What do you think?

36:49.249 --> 36:52.626
- There you go, see?
- Does Dionna need waitresses?

36:52.627 --> 36:55.421
- She got somebody last week.
- I need a job.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.216
RUBY:
I'm smart. I'm young. I'm pretty.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.715
VINNY:
You got two out of three right.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.389
Oi! If it isn't Warren Beauty.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.093
I get more ass than
he does any day.

37:08.685 --> 37:11.513
- Ritchie.
- Ruby, how you been?

37:11.646 --> 37:14.857
I copped that Who's Next album.
I was thinking about you.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.442
- Great, right?
- Yeah.

37:16.443 --> 37:19.943
Those guys are like the
godfathers of punk.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.655
Know that song Baba O'Riley?

37:21.656 --> 37:23.240
- Uh-huh.
- It's my favorite song.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.366
You know who wrote that?

37:24.367 --> 37:26.990
- Engelbert Humperdinck?
- Uh-uh.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.329
You don't think I know?
Come on, I know.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.497
Pete Townshend.

37:30.498 --> 37:33.333
- How do you know that?
- I read the album credits.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.835
The only thing I don't get is

37:34.836 --> 37:37.838
why those four guys are
pissing on a big rock.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.214
They were drinking...

37:39.215 --> 37:41.884
Are you two getting married
here? Can I get to work?

37:41.885 --> 37:44.508
- Are you jealous?
- Please.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.848
- I need a favor.
- What's going on?

37:47.849 --> 37:50.058
Fucking Eddie moved
me in the garage.

37:50.059 --> 37:51.226
My mother's gone along with it.

37:51.227 --> 37:54.180
- What do you want me to do?
- Lend me $20.

37:54.397 --> 37:56.349
- Get outta here.
- Come on.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.151
Wait. The garage could be cool.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.528
Forget that. Come and stay with me.

38:01.529 --> 38:03.655
- We'll take care of you.
- Seriously, no.

38:03.656 --> 38:06.234
You can fix it up. Have privacy.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.994
I mean, fuck living in the house.

38:08.995 --> 38:12.956
I'll live in the fucking garage.
You stay with my crazy family.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.375
I'd live in my car first
before I'd do that shit.

38:15.376 --> 38:18.003
Here. Shut up and take $50.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.963
Don't ever say I never
gave you nothing.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.673
What, are you loaded these days?

38:21.674 --> 38:23.091
Use it well. All right?

38:23.092 --> 38:24.919
RUBY: 50 bucks?

38:25.345 --> 38:28.924
I can turn it into a
palace for 50 bucks.

38:29.098 --> 38:31.517
I'm not doing anything later.

38:31.684 --> 38:34.512
I'll come by and help
you decorate it.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.564
- You know what that means.
- Shut up.

38:37.565 --> 38:40.985
Might as well use this
psycho killer as an excuse.

You did a good job.
I could dig it, you know?

38:55.291 --> 38:58.665
Maybe I can be an
interior decorator.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.098
You could be whatever
you want, I think.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.377
- Sure.
- Yeah.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.756
- You really mean that?
- Of course I mean that.

39:11.933 --> 39:13.635
I don't know.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.518
I feel you're born
into a slot, you know.

- Come on.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.439
Stop with those negative vibes.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.945
You hang around with
those spirit snipers,

39:24.946 --> 39:26.318
they'll steal your light.

- You're too young for that.
- Uh-huh.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.510
Come on, come on.
You don't got to do that.

got to do that. Don't do it.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.402
Where you going?

40:05.820 --> 40:08.155
- I'm gonna go.
- I didn't say to go.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.365
You didn't exactly say
you wanted me to stay.

In an hour. You know. Come on.

41:30.405 --> 41:33.907
I'm trying to be a good husband.
I don't think we can do it.

only one with feelings?

with you. Absolutely.

Selfish bastard. You're
a selfish bastard.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.929
You started this.
I didn't start this.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.515
- It's my fault.
- Put your fucking clothes on.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.810

heard from me for a while

That's not enough.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:08.320
He lives alone. His wife
left him a year ago.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.319
And he works nights.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.784

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.702
- Father Cadilli.
- The priest?

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:26.004

killer's a mulignan.

01:06:12.218 --> 01:06:13.510
It's why they can't find him.

people at the door.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:47.502
ANTHONY: Come up with something
original. I've heard that before.

01:36:47.719 --> 01:36:49.720
CADILLI: Let your heart
keep my commandments.

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:52.222
Do not let kindness
and truth leave you.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.932
ANTHONY: Thank you, Father.

01:36:53.933 --> 01:36:55.134
(BEEPING)

01:37:11.451 --> 01:37:16.373
Vincent, it's the middle of the night.
What's the matter with you?

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.625
Don't make everybody know your
business. Tomorrow's another day.

01:37:20.626 --> 01:37:22.753
She'll be all right with me.

01:37:22.754 --> 01:37:26.174
- Tell her to come home.
- Tomorrow's another day.

01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:34.515
July 29th, 1977.

01:37:35.224 --> 01:37:39.725
This is a warning to all police
agencies in the tri-state area.

01:37:39.771 --> 01:37:41.271
For your information,

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:45.978
a Satanic cult has been instructed
by their high command, Satan,

01:37:46.486 --> 01:37:48.945
to systematically
kill and slaughter

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:52.070
young girls of good
health and clean blood.

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:55.695
Executioners of the cult...

01:37:56.496 --> 01:37:57.822
SON OF SAM: Hi.

01:37:58.748 --> 01:38:02.077
My name is

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:05.539
Mr. Williams.

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:14.096
And I live

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:19.679
in this hole.

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:24.474
I have several children who
I'm turning into killers.

01:38:24.774 --> 01:38:27.477
Wait till they grow up.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:31.273
No! Shut that dog up!

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:39.622
How can this be? I thought I
killed you, Mr. Black Dog.

01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:43.743
(HYSTERICAL) How did you get
in here? Leave me alone!

01:38:44.502 --> 01:38:46.249
What do you want?

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.923
I want you to go out and kill.

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.884
- Kill. Kill.
- (WHIMPERING)

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:55.262
Kill!

01:38:58.224 --> 01:38:59.975
(TEARY) I will kill.

01:38:59.976 --> 01:39:04.602
I will. I'll do anything you say.
I'll do anything you say.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:07.935
Yes, master. I will kill.

01:39:08.192 --> 01:39:10.269
I will kill!

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:14.278
(SEAGULLS CRY)

01:39:14.699 --> 01:39:16.242
Yeah, if I can.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.237
LOU: Listen, I gotta go.

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:22.703
Gentlemen, good morning. Gentlemen!

01:39:23.916 --> 01:39:27.335
Congratulations. Death day came
and went without an incident.

01:39:27.336 --> 01:39:28.795
I need you to stay sharp.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.749
LOU: Pay attention to every
detail, big or small.

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:34.593
We're close. He knows we are.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:37.179
The sick bastard knows
we're onto him.

01:39:37.180 --> 01:39:40.509
We're close. He knows
we're after him.

01:39:41.017 --> 01:39:42.893
Chickie, give me a fork.

01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:46.897
CHICKIE: Vinny, you're 86'd.
You and your freaky friend.

01:39:46.898 --> 01:39:50.272
We're all friends here.
What are you saying?

01:39:51.027 --> 01:39:52.277
What happened?

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:55.489
You didn't tell them what happened?
That creepy bastard.

01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:57.991
Customers thought he
was the Son of Sam.

01:39:57.992 --> 01:39:59.910
- Who?
- Fucking Ritchie.

01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:02.245
I never seen nothing like it.
Not even in 'Nam.

01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:03.914
He's fucking exaggerating.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:07.083
The kid was looking like
Night of the Living Dead.

01:40:07.084 --> 01:40:10.333
My customers are getting
nervous from looking at him.

01:40:10.546 --> 01:40:12.756
So I go over and ask them nicely...

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:14.758
Come on. It didn't
happen like that.

01:40:14.759 --> 01:40:17.427
- What are you making it up for?
- It didn't?

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:19.130
No, it didn't.

01:40:19.472 --> 01:40:21.640
He didn't jump up on the
table like a madman?

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:23.350
He didn't break a
glass over his head

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:25.894
and start licking the
blood like Bela Lugosi?

01:40:25.895 --> 01:40:28.730
It didn't happen like that?
I never seen nothing like it.

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:31.184
That kid scared the
shit out of everybody.

01:40:32.068 --> 01:40:35.272
You know what? I'll serve you guys.

01:40:35.446 --> 01:40:37.989
But not you or that fucking ghoul.

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:40.825
- He's 86'd for life.
- 86 me, too.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:43.078
You're 86'd 'cause it
didn't happen like that.

01:40:43.079 --> 01:40:46.283
VINNY: You're fucking crazy.
You're fucked up.

01:40:46.999 --> 01:40:49.459
What's the matter with you?
Ritchie does that, you don't tell us?

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.294
Come on. Are you shitting me?

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:54.624
Get out of here. You're not
gonna take that for serious?

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:57.176
What's Chickie gotta lie for?

01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:59.970
- Anything else we should know?
- Are you hiding something?

01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:03.890
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You didn't tell us about this.

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.183
What are you protecting him for?

01:41:05.184 --> 01:41:09.062
- What aren't you telling us?
- Don't touch me.

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:10.313
What the fuck...

01:41:10.314 --> 01:41:12.315
I'm gonna go before
something happens.

01:41:12.316 --> 01:41:14.985
- What's wrong with you?
- Come on!

01:41:14.986 --> 01:41:17.689
What's the matter with you?

01:41:19.323 --> 01:41:20.657
This guy's out of line.

01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:23.326
He's protecting Ritchie.
Fucking Ritchie.

01:41:23.327 --> 01:41:25.996
He's got him brainwashed,
I'm telling you.

01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:30.292
Vinny, come back here. Come on.

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:32.541
ANTHONY: What's with the
attitude on this kid?

01:41:34.547 --> 01:41:36.090
Leave him alone. It ain't him.

01:41:36.632 --> 01:41:39.051
- (DISCO MUSIC)
- (CHEERING)

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:45.095
Where do you know Ritchie from?

01:41:45.683 --> 01:41:48.184
Don't worry. You don't
have to be jealous.

01:41:48.185 --> 01:41:50.763
I knew him long before
I ever met you.

01:41:51.314 --> 01:41:53.858
- I just didn't know he did porno.
- Oh, yeah.

01:41:53.859 --> 01:41:55.059
(KNOCKING)

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:58.570
Play my Dead Boys. Don't
make me dance to this shit.

01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:03.158
Hello, Ritchie. Mr. Macho man, tough
Bronx boy, what are you doing...

01:42:03.159 --> 01:42:06.112
- Don't you say anything.
- Don't hurt me.

01:42:07.121 --> 01:42:09.873
MIDNITE: Don't you touch
Bobby. Get your hands off!

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:13.248
Get your hands off him.
I'll fire your ass.

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:16.581
- (MIDNITE YELLING)
- SON OF SAM: M-U

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:24.760
R-D-E-R.

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.257
Murder.

01:42:26.432 --> 01:42:29.267
ANNOUNCER: Hi, everybody.
Welcome to another big ballgame

01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:32.142
with the Yankees and Orioles
here at Yankee Stadium.

01:42:32.355 --> 01:42:34.481
I know everyone's been
complaining about the heat

01:42:34.482 --> 01:42:38.027
and it's been terrible. The
heat wave has been brutal.

01:42:38.194 --> 01:42:40.487
We've got the perfect
setting for a ballgame.

01:42:40.488 --> 01:42:43.487
It's going to be very
exciting as usual.

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:47.535
Especially with Scotty
McGregor and Ron Guidry.

01:42:47.536 --> 01:42:49.746
Guidry has more stuff
than McGregor,

01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:52.582
but McGregor gives the Yankees a
hard time when he's pitching,

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:54.751
and he's doing it today.

01:42:54.752 --> 01:42:59.130
Coming to the plate, Reggie
Jackson, who's really struggled.

01:42:59.131 --> 01:43:02.384
Reggie steps into the
batter's box, taps the plate.

01:43:02.385 --> 01:43:04.594
And he does look determined.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:08.220
Scotty McGregor steps off
the mound, gets back on.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:11.556
Here's the pitch. Strike
one for number 44.

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:16.106
If you remember, Reggie has had
problems with Billy Martin all year.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.816
He's in Martin's doghouse.

01:43:17.817 --> 01:43:20.777
He yells, but Reggie doesn't look.

01:43:20.778 --> 01:43:23.151
They've had their problems,
but they get over it.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:26.075
- Reggie steps back in the box.
- (DOG BARKING)

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:28.702
Here's the pitch.

01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:30.120
- (DOG BARKING)
- (GIRL SCREAMING)

01:43:30.121 --> 01:43:34.997
Reggie looks for the sign from
third-base coach Dick Howser,

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:38.086
then steps back into the box.

01:43:38.087 --> 01:43:41.131
Number 44 is ready.
McGregor into the wind-up.

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:45.053
Here's the pitch. Reggie swings,
hits a foul ball into the seats.

01:43:45.386 --> 01:43:47.595
Looks like he split that bat.

01:43:47.596 --> 01:43:49.806
He's gotta walk and
get another bat.

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:53.935
While he's doing that, you know
what's happening in New York.

01:43:53.936 --> 01:43:58.687
Abe Beame, who was my accounting
teacher, the mayor of New York,

01:43:58.774 --> 01:44:04.070
is really having his problems
with the Son of Sam murders

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:06.573
that are happening up in the Bronx.

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:10.574
So I want you people to be careful
when you go out spooning.

01:44:11.162 --> 01:44:12.871
Back to the ballgame.

01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:15.416
The Yankees have been
in a slump lately.

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:20.547
Reggie needs one of those long balls
to get them out of it if he can.

01:44:21.422 --> 01:44:24.841
Reggie steps back into the
box. He's got the new bat.

01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:27.969
McGregor checks the
sign from home plate.

01:44:27.970 --> 01:44:29.679
Here's the pitch. Into...

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.183
- (GUNSHOTS, SHATTERING)
- Holy cow, that is gone.

01:44:33.184 --> 01:44:35.477
Deep in the right field bleachers.

01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:38.855
That ties the Orioles in the
bottom of the fifth inning.

01:44:38.856 --> 01:44:43.026
Reggie Jackson gets those
home runs when you need them.

01:44:43.027 --> 01:44:44.527
Sure came through that time.

01:44:44.528 --> 01:44:47.106
Holy cow. Unbelievable.

01:44:47.156 --> 01:44:49.866
Let's go to eyewitness news
reporter John Jeffries,

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:51.659
who's been covering this story.

01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:55.622
Son of Sam struck last night in
Brooklyn for the first time.

01:44:55.623 --> 01:44:59.250
I'm here, John Jeffries, in the
predominantly black neighborhood

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:04.082
of Bedford-Stuyvesant to
get a darker perspective.

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:07.175
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

01:45:07.176 --> 01:45:10.926
I'm just hoping that they get
him quick, and I don't care.

01:45:11.222 --> 01:45:12.799
Thank you.

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:15.767
It's terrible. Bad for
Brooklyn, bad for New York,

01:45:15.768 --> 01:45:18.895
bad for America and for the world.

01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:20.897
Thank you, sir. Your view.

01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:23.942
Son of Sam knows better
than to come into Bed-Stuy,

01:45:23.943 --> 01:45:26.152
do or die with that crap
'cause we don't care.

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:29.989
He's crazy but not that crazy.
I'd love to beat him down.

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.783
He would wish he was dead.

01:45:32.326 --> 01:45:34.699
I'd love to catch him
here in Bed-Stuy.

01:45:35.162 --> 01:45:36.287
Thank you.

01:45:36.288 --> 01:45:39.833
Exactly. Hello, my name
is Cassandra Buchanan.

01:45:39.834 --> 01:45:42.878
I live there at 85 Crown Street.

01:45:43.128 --> 01:45:47.754
And I am going to give you
your darker perspective.

01:45:48.092 --> 01:45:50.886
The darker perspective is...

01:45:51.512 --> 01:45:56.843
I thank God, I thank
God, I thank God

01:45:56.976 --> 01:46:02.307
that it's a white man who kills
all of those white people.

01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:06.067
Because if it were a black man

01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:09.946
who kills all of
those white people,

01:46:09.947 --> 01:46:14.033
there would be the
biggest race riot

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:17.078
right here in New York city.

01:46:17.872 --> 01:46:19.539
I'd like to say one thing.

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:22.834
I'm surprised you are
in the black community.

01:46:22.835 --> 01:46:25.169
I didn't think you
liked black people.

01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:27.168
- (PEOPLE LAUGHING)
- John Jeffries here...

01:46:28.465 --> 01:46:33.177
In the Bedford-Stuyvesant
section of Brooklyn, New York.

01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:34.262
Thank you, John.

01:46:34.263 --> 01:46:35.885
(CHATTERING)

01:46:39.268 --> 01:46:42.103
He's crazy. He had
this look in his eyes.

01:46:42.104 --> 01:46:44.480
He said he'd kill me.
Help me, Joey.

01:46:44.481 --> 01:46:46.941
Bobby, nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:46:46.942 --> 01:46:49.315
It's a good thing you came to me.

01:46:51.322 --> 01:46:54.526
- Vinny, you seen Ritchie?
- No, not me.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.578
He's the only guy on the list we
can't account for last night.

01:46:58.579 --> 01:47:00.452
Where's this club, CBGB's?

01:47:00.664 --> 01:47:02.958
Are you still with that shit?

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:05.209
How do you follow
this clown around?

01:47:05.210 --> 01:47:07.337
It's like the blind
leading the blind.

01:47:07.338 --> 01:47:09.666
Who's blind? They
think for themselves.

01:47:09.715 --> 01:47:11.549
I got my head screwed on straight.

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:13.377
Yeah, exactly.

01:47:14.511 --> 01:47:16.054
I know Ritchie, okay?

01:47:16.055 --> 01:47:17.847
I know him as if he was my brother.

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:20.725
Even though you saw him at the
disco the night of the killings?

01:47:20.726 --> 01:47:21.851
Especially.

01:47:21.852 --> 01:47:24.437
JOE: Even though we don't
know where he was?

01:47:24.438 --> 01:47:28.358
He fits the police profile.
He's got weird religious beliefs.

01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:29.901
That shit he pulled at the diner.

01:47:29.902 --> 01:47:32.195
You know him that well?

01:47:32.196 --> 01:47:34.569
- Yeah, I do.
- Tell him, Bobby.

01:47:34.573 --> 01:47:38.494
Tell him about the fag strip joint.
Tell him who the star attraction was.

01:47:38.619 --> 01:47:40.620
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:47:40.621 --> 01:47:43.456
Ritchie's a dancer at Male World.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:46.661
My friend works there.
He also does porno flicks.

01:47:47.002 --> 01:47:49.045
Did you know that
about your friend?

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.465
What else don't you know
about this pervert?

01:47:52.216 --> 01:47:55.426
It doesn't make him the Son of
Sam 'cause of that. Come on.

01:47:55.427 --> 01:47:58.721
Killer, fag, pimp, punk rocker.

01:47:58.722 --> 01:48:03.098
Queer, pervert, homo, degenerate.
Whatever the fuck it is.

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:06.097
Who wants something like
that around here anyway?

01:48:06.563 --> 01:48:09.399
He's your friend? Don't you
wanna know what's going on?

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:12.274
Soon as he calls, I'm gonna
have a talk with that guy.

01:48:12.486 --> 01:48:15.610
Talk to him? You ain't
thinking straight.

01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:19.323
There are people getting
killed in our neighborhood.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.035
Are you with us or not?

01:48:21.036 --> 01:48:24.661
Vin, it's not your fault.
You didn't know. Nobody did.

01:48:24.748 --> 01:48:27.167
He's a crazy fuck, but he's smart.

01:48:27.376 --> 01:48:29.919
He's eluded the police and
the FBI all this time.

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:31.622
Listen to him.

01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:34.299
Okay, Vin, forget about us.

01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:37.176
But what happens if Dionna's next?

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:38.678
How you gonna live with that?

01:48:38.679 --> 01:48:42.133
Knowing you could have saved
her if you'd had some balls.

01:48:43.475 --> 01:48:45.222
JOE: Come on, Vin.

01:48:48.564 --> 01:48:51.608
All right. I'll help
you guys, okay?

01:48:51.692 --> 01:48:54.569
It's not just you, Vinny.
He fooled the whole world.

01:48:54.570 --> 01:48:57.196
I said all right.
Just leave me alone.

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:58.819
Shut the fuck up.

01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:01.200
JOE: You're doing the right thing.

01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:04.496
Sure I am. I'm a great
fucking friend.

01:49:10.294 --> 01:49:12.792
(PUNK ROCK)

01:49:49.291 --> 01:49:51.164
(ARGUING)

01:49:53.045 --> 01:49:54.670
Is that Vin?

01:49:54.671 --> 01:49:56.498
- Where?
- Right there.

01:49:58.467 --> 01:50:01.260
That's why he didn't make the gig.
Idiot got the dates mixed up.

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:03.213
Give me your shades.

01:50:04.848 --> 01:50:06.971
Watch me fuck with him.

01:50:08.185 --> 01:50:10.387
- What you gonna do?
- Watch this. Watch.

01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:27.829
Man. You're the guy.
You've seen our handiwork.

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:30.123
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Cult's gonna get you.

01:50:30.124 --> 01:50:32.292
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Man.

01:50:33.210 --> 01:50:36.254
Shit, Ritchie. You fucking asshole.

01:50:36.797 --> 01:50:39.591
You almost made me fucking
piss on myself, you fuck.

01:50:41.927 --> 01:50:44.262
What the fuck did you do to
your hair? Shit looks stupid.

01:50:44.263 --> 01:50:47.262
What the fuck are you doing here?
The gig was last week.

01:50:50.394 --> 01:50:53.062
I gotta talk to you.
I gotta be serious.

01:50:53.063 --> 01:50:56.267
We gotta be straight to
each other. Man to man.

01:50:56.567 --> 01:50:58.610
Square business, okay?

01:50:59.069 --> 01:51:02.398
Fucking look at me when I'm talking
to you. Are you in a cult?

01:51:04.408 --> 01:51:07.782
Answer me. Are you in a
fucking cult? Please tell me.

01:51:08.453 --> 01:51:10.326
What kind of cult?

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:13.040
What kind of answer is that?

01:51:13.041 --> 01:51:14.788
Let me tell you something.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:16.252
Joey T's in there.

01:51:16.253 --> 01:51:18.831
He's got them all riled
up looking for you.

01:51:19.423 --> 01:51:24.254
They got this list, they're spying
on people. You're top of the list.

01:51:24.386 --> 01:51:26.429
Now laugh at that shit.

01:51:27.598 --> 01:51:29.971
Wait a minute. What list?

01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.602
You can tell me. Friend to friend.

01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:35.271
I won't go to the cops.
Are you the Son of Sam?

01:51:35.272 --> 01:51:38.816
They think I'm the Son of Sam?
You think I'm the Son of Sam?

01:51:38.817 --> 01:51:41.194
It doesn't matter what I think.

01:51:41.195 --> 01:51:43.863
They're in there right
now looking for you.

01:51:43.864 --> 01:51:45.486
It doesn't matter?

01:51:45.782 --> 01:51:48.701
You must have thought
something. Brought them here.

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:50.036
I didn't do that.

01:51:50.037 --> 01:51:52.788
I wanted things to
be straightened out.

01:51:52.789 --> 01:51:55.708
That's what I'm here for.
I just told them to talk to you.

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:57.627
Why don't you talk
to me like a man?

01:51:57.628 --> 01:52:00.206
Man to man, like we always have.

01:52:00.964 --> 01:52:05.468
Fuck. I wanted to, but
you've been acting strange.

01:52:05.469 --> 01:52:06.636
Me?

01:52:06.637 --> 01:52:09.215
Look at yourself. Look
in the fucking mirror.

01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:12.225
Look at that hair.
What the fuck is that?

01:52:12.226 --> 01:52:14.810
Since when does your
hair make you a killer?

01:52:14.811 --> 01:52:17.480
- It's not your hair.
- What are you talking about?

01:52:17.481 --> 01:52:19.482
Normal people don't
dress the way you do,

01:52:19.483 --> 01:52:22.693
and they aren't in a cult.

01:52:22.694 --> 01:52:26.819
You think I'm the fucking Son of Sam
and you bring a lynch mob down here.

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:31.118
- I'm just trying...
- I thought you were my friend.

01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:35.331
I am your friend. I made
a mistake. I'm sorry.

01:52:35.332 --> 01:52:39.418
Bobby the fairy tells me you're
a nude dancer at a fag club.

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:40.878
What am I supposed to do with that?

01:52:40.879 --> 01:52:44.208
- What?
- He says you're a fag dancer.

01:52:44.258 --> 01:52:48.133
Bobby the fag don't know shit.
'Cause he's a homo, now I'm one?

01:52:49.346 --> 01:52:51.469
I don't know. You tell me.

01:52:53.141 --> 01:52:55.601
Are you sucking dick?

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:59.557
First you think I'm the Son of
Sam, now I'm a fucking homo.

01:53:02.276 --> 01:53:04.478
You lost all faith in me?

01:53:08.156 --> 01:53:10.404
I don't know you, Ritchie.

01:53:11.368 --> 01:53:13.991
I don't know who you fucking are.

01:53:14.955 --> 01:53:18.375
I don't know you, man.
I don't know you, you fuck.

01:53:19.418 --> 01:53:21.712
- Fuck you!
- RUBY: Let's go, Ritchie.

01:53:21.713 --> 01:53:25.212
- You're gonna need me.
- Don't do me any favors.

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:27.341
- VINNY: Ruby! Come here.
- What happened?

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:28.801
RITCHIE: Fucking prick.

01:53:28.802 --> 01:53:30.303
Ruby, can you talk to him?

01:53:30.304 --> 01:53:32.973
- What did you do?
- VINNY: Let me talk to you for a minute.

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:38.728
Go home. You're always
starting fucking trouble.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:40.563
Motherfucker.

01:53:40.564 --> 01:53:43.643
Those are the freakiest people
I've ever seen in my life.

01:53:43.984 --> 01:53:45.151
Fucking filthy.

01:53:45.152 --> 01:53:48.697
I could take ten showers and
I'd still feel fucking dirty.

01:53:50.365 --> 01:53:51.942
We didn't see him.

01:53:54.995 --> 01:53:57.204
Watch where you're going, freak.

01:53:57.205 --> 01:53:59.081
Fuck you, guido.

01:53:59.082 --> 01:54:02.126
- What did you say?
- Fuck you, guido!

01:54:02.586 --> 01:54:04.003
All right, man, you're drunk,

01:54:04.004 --> 01:54:06.502
so we're gonna give
you one more chance.

01:54:06.965 --> 01:54:08.716
Who's your favorite baseball team?

01:54:08.717 --> 01:54:10.544
Boston Red Sox.

01:54:10.927 --> 01:54:12.128
(YELLING)

01:54:12.429 --> 01:54:13.846
Motherfucker.

01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:15.382
(YELLING, STRUGGLING)

01:54:19.061 --> 01:54:20.808
Come here, you son of a bitch!

01:54:24.441 --> 01:54:25.900
Boston Red Sox.

01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:29.355
Go back to Fenway, you
Beantown cocksucker.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.403
- Let's go home.
- I ruined my pants.

01:54:35.118 --> 01:54:38.492
- Who does this look like?
- Like a young Dean Martin.

01:54:39.164 --> 01:54:40.247
Dean Martin.

01:54:40.248 --> 01:54:43.748
This looks like that guy
on the Grand Concourse.

01:54:44.461 --> 01:54:46.834
- You're not serious.
- I am.

01:54:46.963 --> 01:54:48.540
Reno!

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:52.010
That Matty on the Grand
Concourse. Bring him here.

01:54:52.135 --> 01:54:53.678
I'm on my way.

01:54:58.475 --> 01:55:00.476
It doesn't really
look like him at all.

01:55:00.477 --> 01:55:03.180
What do you mean,
it doesn't look like him?

01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:07.351
If you can't see what's happening,
you're as brainwashed as Ruby is.

01:55:07.651 --> 01:55:09.603
What do you mean, brainwashed?

01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:11.563
Look what he's doing to her.

01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:15.780
JOE: He's fucking Ruby while
people stand around filming it.

01:55:17.077 --> 01:55:19.405
JOE: Would you do that to Dionna?

01:55:19.454 --> 01:55:21.497
Would you fuck your
wife in a porn film?

01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:23.200
Your wife, not mine.

01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:28.963
Ruby's going along with it,
but he's got a spell over her.

01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:31.508
He's turning her into
a fucking porn star.

01:55:33.343 --> 01:55:34.715
Come here.

01:55:36.179 --> 01:55:38.723
Now, you tell me...

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:44.642
that doesn't look like Ritchie.

01:55:45.147 --> 01:55:47.850
- Holy shit. Let me see.
- Son of Sam.

01:55:49.693 --> 01:55:51.736
- Wake up, Vinny.
- Shit!

01:56:16.887 --> 01:56:18.387
Where the hell have you been?

01:56:18.388 --> 01:56:21.091
- I'm sorry.
- You're three hours late.

01:56:21.516 --> 01:56:25.060
- You're three hours late.
- Traffic was terrible.

01:56:25.061 --> 01:56:28.356
- Vinny.
- Dee, stay where you are.

01:56:28.732 --> 01:56:31.776
- I gotta cut her hair.
- You'll cut her hair.

01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:35.777
- Come over here.
- Dee, stay where you are.

01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:39.492
Crazy things going on.
I'm almost ready, Gloria.

01:56:39.493 --> 01:56:42.661
What are you shoving me for?
What's the matter?

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:45.706
- See the game last night?
- Pull yourself together.

01:56:45.707 --> 01:56:47.666
Go in the bathroom

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:50.586
and shave, and take some Listerine.

01:56:52.923 --> 01:56:57.259
Take some Listerine and pull yourself
together for these customers.

01:56:57.260 --> 01:57:00.213
This is a business here.
You respect it.

01:57:01.431 --> 01:57:05.352
I'm going through a tough time.
I was hoping you'd help me out.

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:09.314
Pull yourself together and then
we'll deal with the customers.

01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:12.274
Dee, I'm ready.

01:57:12.275 --> 01:57:14.235
- Now, Vinny?
- One minute.

01:57:14.236 --> 01:57:15.694
Did you hear a word I said?

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:19.615
I said pull yourself the
fuck together, and then...

01:57:19.616 --> 01:57:23.866
If it wasn't for me, you
wouldn't have this great place.

01:57:24.579 --> 01:57:27.790
- What does that mean?
- I brought all these customers.

01:57:27.791 --> 01:57:30.626
You came here because
of me, didn't you?

01:57:30.627 --> 01:57:32.875
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't fucking lie.

01:57:33.088 --> 01:57:35.047
If it wasn't for me, none
of you would be here.

01:57:35.048 --> 01:57:38.467
This place was a piece of shit
before I fucking came here.

01:57:38.468 --> 01:57:43.219
Watch your fucking mouth!
This is a business.

01:57:43.348 --> 01:57:47.184
Here, Gloria. Take that.
Fuck you and fuck this place!

01:57:47.185 --> 01:57:50.355
Get the fuck out!
Get out of my shop!

01:57:50.397 --> 01:57:53.601
Fucking shit place. Fuck
you and your customers.

01:57:54.359 --> 01:57:58.109
- Fuck me? I'm gonna fuck you.
- Fucking keys. Come on.

01:58:01.992 --> 01:58:04.536
You forgot to lock the
door, you stupid bitch.

01:58:04.619 --> 01:58:06.821
Talk to yourselves, okay.

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.038
Who took my fucking keys?
There they are.

01:58:11.209 --> 01:58:13.662
My glasses. You sons of bitches.

01:58:19.634 --> 01:58:21.962
VINNY: What the fuck are you doing?

01:58:23.805 --> 01:58:26.348
What you doing, baby? Come on.

01:58:26.349 --> 01:58:29.018

up for you, baby.

02:10:28.404 --> 02:10:31.027
- I gotta talk to you.
- About what?

02:10:32.158 --> 02:10:35.532
Dionna. She left me.

02:10:38.122 --> 02:10:40.582
She's gonna divorce me.
It's all over.

02:10:40.583 --> 02:10:41.875
- No.
- Yeah.

02:10:41.876 --> 02:10:44.670
Come in, man. Come inside.

02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:49.591
I don't wanna go inside.
I don't want her to hear me.

02:10:49.592 --> 02:10:51.051
VINNY: Come over here.

02:10:51.052 --> 02:10:53.926
Talk to me over here.
Please. Come on.

02:10:56.223 --> 02:10:57.595
I'll be right back.

02:11:06.025 --> 02:11:08.023
(MURDEROUS SCREAMING)

02:11:12.198 --> 02:11:14.032
I had this big fight with Gloria.

02:11:14.033 --> 02:11:18.244
She calls Dionna and tells her about
all the women I've been with.

02:11:18.245 --> 02:11:20.121
Dionna flips out and
wants to leave me.

02:11:20.122 --> 02:11:24.372
She wants to divorce me because
I took her to Plato's Retreat.

02:11:24.627 --> 02:11:26.544
I don't know what to say.

02:11:26.545 --> 02:11:29.255
We're leaving tonight.
Maybe you should, too.

02:11:29.256 --> 02:11:30.507
We should get out.

02:11:30.508 --> 02:11:31.925
I'm packing.

02:11:31.926 --> 02:11:34.010
So me and her were like that.

02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:37.597
Run. I'm sorry about everything.
Run, man. Please.

02:11:37.598 --> 02:11:39.641
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

02:11:39.642 --> 02:11:42.812
- Run! Now!
- Get that son of a bitch!

02:11:43.813 --> 02:11:45.981
- JOE: Stay right there.

02:11:47.650 --> 02:11:49.317
- Luigi wants to see you.
- Come on.

02:11:49.318 --> 02:11:51.820
- Come on, man.
- You set me up!

02:11:51.821 --> 02:11:53.864
I told you to run.

02:12:41.412 --> 02:12:44.664
Get off of me! Get off of me!

02:12:44.665 --> 02:12:45.999
Hold her!

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:47.208
JOE: Come on!

02:12:47.209 --> 02:12:49.085
We're gonna see Luigi now.

02:12:49.086 --> 02:12:51.963
Come on, let's go! You ain't
getting out of this one!

02:12:51.964 --> 02:12:53.711
Come on!

02:12:54.884 --> 02:12:56.445
(RUBY, SCREAMING) Leave him alone!

02:13:01.348 --> 02:13:03.767
Get the fuck away from him!

02:13:04.477 --> 02:13:06.394
What the fuck is going on here?

02:13:06.395 --> 02:13:08.646
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus Christ!

02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:11.733
We caught the Son of Sam.
Don't fuck with us!

02:13:11.734 --> 02:13:15.361
He ain't the fucking Son of Sam.
They caught the killer.

02:13:15.362 --> 02:13:19.574
- Got him in Yonkers, idiot!
- Don't fucking lie!

02:13:19.575 --> 02:13:22.619
Tell me my Luger's full of shit.
Fuck with this, hero.

02:13:23.078 --> 02:13:24.951
My Luger says they caught him.

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:28.955
Call an ambulance right
now or I start shooting.

02:13:29.251 --> 02:13:32.955
What happened? Joey, what happened?

02:13:33.422 --> 02:13:36.125
HELEN: Talk to me! What happened?

(WOMEN WAILING)

02:13:50.397 --> 02:13:52.599
Get out of here. Go away.

02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:05.828
Just beat it, kid.

02:14:05.829 --> 02:14:09.374
You fucking traitor. What
the fuck are you doing?

02:14:15.714 --> 02:14:17.336
I'm sorry.

02:14:23.764 --> 02:14:26.012
Did you call an ambulance?

02:14:26.809 --> 02:14:29.143
Yeah. It's coming.
It's coming right now.

02:14:29.144 --> 02:14:30.812
It better be.

02:14:37.486 --> 02:14:39.233
(DOG BARKING)

02:14:39.321 --> 02:14:43.025
Of all the things, a parking
ticket did Son of Sam in.

02:14:43.158 --> 02:14:47.488
On July 31st, 1977, he
shot his last two victims.

02:14:47.663 --> 02:14:51.868
An eyewitness noticed a parking ticket
under his windshield as he left.

02:14:52.126 --> 02:14:54.335
Of the four tickets
issued in that area,

02:14:54.336 --> 02:14:56.629
one bore the name
of David Berkowitz,

02:14:56.630 --> 02:14:58.673
a resident of Yonkers, New York.

02:14:58.674 --> 02:15:01.175
At first, Berkowitz
claimed insanity,

02:15:01.176 --> 02:15:05.305
saying a 2,000-year-old dog
named Harvey told him to do it.

02:15:05.306 --> 02:15:07.258
Eventually he pled guilty.

02:15:07.349 --> 02:15:13.978
That sick fuck is sewing a sentence of six
consecutive terms of 25 years to life.

02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:18.318
The Yankees win their
21st World Series.

02:15:18.319 --> 02:15:22.569
Of course the Yankees won the World
Series against the LA Dodgers.

02:15:23.198 --> 02:15:27.035
Led by Reggie Jackson's
three consecutive home runs

02:15:27.036 --> 02:15:29.034
in the sixth and deciding game.

(CROWD CHEERING)

02:15:39.632 --> 02:15:41.254
Elvis Presley died.

3, 700 were arrested
during the blackout,

02:15:44.428 --> 02:15:47.256
with damage going into the
hundreds of millions.

02:15:47.306 --> 02:15:50.224
To no one's surprise,
most of the destruction

02:15:50.225 --> 02:15:54.228
took place in Brooklyn,
Harlem and the South Bronx.

02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:58.900
'77 was also one of the hottest
summers in memory in New York City.

02:15:58.901 --> 02:16:02.987
New York. The city that I
love and hate equally.

02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:06.074
There are eight million
stories in the naked city,

02:16:06.075 --> 02:16:07.575
and this was one of them.

02:16:07.576 --> 02:16:11.996
If I can make it there

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:16.459

new start of it
