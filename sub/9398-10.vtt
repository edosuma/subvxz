00:00.339 --> 00:03.661
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

00:03.671 --> 00:05.446
Merry Christmas, George!

00:05.580 --> 00:08.452
Merry Christmas, movie house!

00:11.059 --> 00:14.132
Have you ever wondered what
marks our time here...

00:16.043 --> 00:19.394
if one life can really make
an impact on the world...

00:20.031 --> 00:22.793
or if the choices
we make matter?

00:24.929 --> 00:28.444
Sometimes, in order to move forward,
you have to go back.

00:31.819 --> 00:35.747
In this case,
just a few minutes.

00:52.878 --> 00:55.662
So, the doctor said you're fine,
you and the baby?

00:55.678 --> 00:57.850
Yeah. We're fine.

00:58.082 --> 01:00.423
We are all gonna be fine.

01:02.119 --> 01:06.180
Listen... there's a reason that
I played so bad tonight at first.

01:06.347 --> 01:07.803
What do you mean?

01:08.459 --> 01:09.842
Nathan, look out!

01:15.107 --> 01:16.501
Haley!

01:23.285 --> 01:26.082
Haley! Baby! Baby!

01:26.096 --> 01:27.650
Oh, god!

01:28.376 --> 01:30.512
- What happened?!
- They just hit her, man!

01:30.527 --> 01:32.283
I'll call 911!

01:32.505 --> 01:34.011
Lucas, stay with her.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.493
Son of a bitch!

01:43.007 --> 01:44.601
What did you do?!

01:50.536 --> 01:51.701
Nathan!

02:01.146 --> 02:02.192
He's dead.

02:02.507 --> 02:04.012
You killed him, son.

02:09.717 --> 02:10.970
Go on.

02:11.508 --> 02:12.452
Dad?

02:12.467 --> 02:13.880
Haley needs you, Nathan.

02:13.897 --> 02:15.383
Your child needs you.

02:16.187 --> 02:17.491
Go!

02:45.616 --> 02:47.993
She's been hit by a car.
You've got to help her.

02:48.006 --> 02:49.072
She's pregnant.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.101
What's her name?

02:50.118 --> 02:51.680
Uh... Haley.

02:51.697 --> 02:52.861
How long has she been pregnant?

02:52.897 --> 02:55.153
I don't know. A few...

02:55.165 --> 02:56.622
Come on, Haley.

02:57.848 --> 02:59.681
A f-- A f--

03:03.625 --> 03:05.513
He passed out. I got him.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.083
Hold on.

03:08.968 --> 03:10.162
Heart's not beating.

03:10.176 --> 03:12.680
I got a full cardiac arrest.
Requesting backup.

04:07.016 --> 04:08.341
Hey!

04:12.336 --> 04:13.592
Hey!

04:16.197 --> 04:18.851
Excuse me.
Can you tell me what's happening?

04:22.245 --> 04:23.560
Hi, Luke.

04:24.437 --> 04:27.191
Keith, it's you, right?
You're alive.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.291
Not exactly.

04:28.307 --> 04:29.621
What do you mean,
"not exactly"?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.481
All in good time, Luke.
We don't want to be late.

04:31.516 --> 04:32.740
Late for what?

04:36.737 --> 04:38.042
Haley.

04:38.567 --> 04:39.973
What happened to her?

04:40.137 --> 04:41.563
You don't remember?

04:42.268 --> 04:45.472
I... there was an accident.

04:45.606 --> 04:47.002
It was no accident.

04:47.578 --> 04:52.420
I... I was right there with Haley.
I was standing right there.

04:59.028 --> 05:00.223
My heart.

05:00.328 --> 05:03.333
Your heart isn't the only one
that's breaking right now.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.542
Come on.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.543
There's been an accident.

05:15.558 --> 05:17.802
Lucas and Haley are
in the hospital.

05:18.487 --> 05:21.112
It's bad, Peyton,
it's really bad.

05:25.028 --> 05:26.663
Come on. I'll drive.

05:31.235 --> 05:32.673
It's not fair.

05:33.466 --> 05:36.203
Peyton -- all these bad
things keep happening to her.

05:36.217 --> 05:38.682
Good things happen to her,
too, Luke.

05:39.007 --> 05:40.550
Like you.

05:40.915 --> 05:44.120
Okay, look, I don't understand this.
I mean, what are you, Keith?

05:44.138 --> 05:46.701
An angel? A bad dream?

05:46.718 --> 05:49.640
More like a guide.

05:49.657 --> 05:51.293
A guide?

05:51.735 --> 05:53.290
To where?

05:54.006 --> 05:58.472
Luke, you just had a heart attack.
You're not even breathing right now.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.801
So, what -- I'm dead?

06:00.816 --> 06:02.231
Not yet.

06:02.548 --> 06:05.753
- Well, then you --
- No, I'm dead.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.670
Sorry.

06:09.145 --> 06:10.973
And what about Haley?

06:11.397 --> 06:13.263
Haley's not good.

06:13.728 --> 06:14.903
Nathan?

06:18.425 --> 06:19.543
Nathan?

06:20.616 --> 06:22.440
What's happening? How's Haley?

06:22.457 --> 06:24.182
She's being prepped
for surgery.

06:24.197 --> 06:26.693
She has multiple fractures of the legs,
some head trauma,

06:26.708 --> 06:29.213
possible collapsed lung,
broken ribs,

06:29.227 --> 06:31.210
and  a good deal of
internal bleeding.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.063
What about the baby?

06:33.408 --> 06:35.953
With this kind of
severe trauma...

06:36.677 --> 06:39.292
we're gonna do
everything that we can.

06:39.307 --> 06:42.752
But right now,
our priority is saving your wife.

06:49.617 --> 06:53.151
So... is she gonna be okay?

06:53.165 --> 06:54.440
Is she gonna lose the baby?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.711
Well, that hasn't
been written yet.

06:57.616 --> 06:59.510
You know what? This sucks.

06:59.527 --> 07:02.790
All these decent people,
and bad things keep happening to them.

07:02.807 --> 07:06.832
I mean...
you were a good guy, Keith.

07:06.905 --> 07:08.011
So?

07:08.025 --> 07:10.761
So, you got shot for it!

07:10.788 --> 07:13.872
Peyton lost both mothers,
she gets shot and attacked.

07:13.888 --> 07:15.600
Haley's now in surgery.

07:15.618 --> 07:17.752
- Meaning what?
- Meaning...

07:17.786 --> 07:21.710
what's the point of being a good
person if this is how it goes?

07:24.725 --> 07:28.411
So, you're asking if,
by being a good person,

07:28.428 --> 07:30.143
have you changed anything?

07:30.517 --> 07:34.953
You know, considering apparently I'm
lying on my deathbed right now, yes.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.910
Well, let's take a look.

07:51.808 --> 07:53.451
Recognize her?

07:54.356 --> 07:55.682
No.

07:59.786 --> 08:01.183
Is  it Brooke?

08:01.918 --> 08:03.293
What happened to her?

08:03.306 --> 08:05.032
Why don't you go ask her?

08:05.528 --> 08:07.071
It's okay. Go on. 

08:18.558 --> 08:20.122
Hey, Brooke?

08:22.187 --> 08:23.440
What's wrong?

08:24.458 --> 08:26.392
Get away from me.

08:29.488 --> 08:31.000
What's wrong?

08:32.307 --> 08:35.549
I said get away from me!

08:40.056 --> 08:41.990
What is this?

08:42.246 --> 08:45.470
This is the world that would have been
if you had led a different life, Luke.

08:45.488 --> 08:47.322
What about real life, huh?

08:47.337 --> 08:49.243
Real life is still there.

09:12.856 --> 09:16.263
Nathan...  how's Haley?

09:16.548 --> 09:18.250
She's in surgery.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.511
And Lucas?

09:21.405 --> 09:22.840
I don't know.

09:24.727 --> 09:27.510
It should have been me.
It was all my fault.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.423
No, it wasn't. It was an accident --
like the bridge.

09:30.436 --> 09:31.680
No, it wasn't.

09:31.697 --> 09:35.310
And now Haley's in surgery, and even
if she makes it, the baby could --

09:35.327 --> 09:37.171
she could still lose the baby.

09:37.186 --> 09:38.943
And Lucas could die.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.872
My dad's in jail.

09:41.285 --> 09:42.751
Nathan...

09:44.468 --> 09:47.140
I wish I would have
died under that water.

09:48.098 --> 09:50.361
None of this would
have happened.

10:40.718 --> 10:42.370
It's okay, Nathan.

10:45.448 --> 10:48.900
Why'd you have to save me,
Keith? Huh?

10:50.008 --> 10:52.741
If I would have died,
then there's no Daunte,

10:52.756 --> 10:54.513
and there's no accident.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.583
And Haley and the
baby are fine.

11:00.907 --> 11:02.820
Come on, Keith!

11:03.517 --> 11:06.650
You can save me,
but you can't answer me?

11:13.352 --> 11:14.773
Thanks for nothing.

11:20.319 --> 11:21.920
So, it was you.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.193
No, it was him.

11:25.509 --> 11:28.161
Most people are stronger
than they know.

11:28.177 --> 11:32.291
They just...
forget to believe in it sometimes.

11:33.298 --> 11:35.120
It's my fault.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.681
I wanted to win the
state championship.

11:38.955 --> 11:40.573
I could have let
him lose that game.

11:40.586 --> 11:43.002
I should have been more
supportive of him and Haley.

11:43.656 --> 11:45.210
Right.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.443
Well, let's take another
look at that world --

11:48.905 --> 11:51.392
you know,
the one where you're a lesser guy.

11:52.705 --> 11:54.100
Come on.

11:55.098 --> 11:56.472
Come on.

11:58.965 --> 12:01.110
Do you have the new
Haley James album?

12:03.717 --> 12:05.122
On vinyl.

12:05.925 --> 12:10.452
Nice. Yeah,
I got a promo copy right here.

12:10.517 --> 12:12.241
You know she's from Tree Hill?

12:12.257 --> 12:14.862
Yeah, I know.

12:18.558 --> 12:20.751
I take it you're not a fan.

12:24.547 --> 12:26.560
She never went back, Luke.

12:30.208 --> 12:31.850
I don't believe it.

12:33.358 --> 12:35.120
They loved each other.

12:35.508 --> 12:37.073
Yeah, they did.

12:37.088 --> 12:40.202
But you never went to New
York to ask her to come back.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.860
That doesn't mean she didn't love him,
that they weren't meant to be.

12:43.877 --> 12:46.261
But without you,
Haley stayed out on tour,

12:46.276 --> 12:48.403
and by the time she came home,

12:49.956 --> 12:52.701
Nathan's pride was just
too much to overcome.

12:54.358 --> 12:57.912
Pride gets in the way of a lot of
good things in this life, Luke.

13:01.828 --> 13:03.010
"Journey".

13:04.668 --> 13:06.671
Man, I used to love "Journey".

13:07.845 --> 13:09.070
Keith.

13:11.337 --> 13:13.130
Oh, yeah.

13:14.196 --> 13:16.790
You remember when you
went to that beach party

13:16.806 --> 13:19.583
and how you took the time
to go and talk to Nathan?

13:20.137 --> 13:21.871
That mattered, Luke.

13:22.487 --> 13:24.311
It all matters.

13:26.836 --> 13:27.920
Come on.

13:47.915 --> 13:50.591
All right,
step away from The Cure albums.

13:50.735 --> 13:53.120
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, Peyton.

13:53.465 --> 13:56.431
So, I heard about Lucas.
How's he doing?

13:56.445 --> 13:58.371
He's not so good.

13:58.976 --> 14:00.950
Haley's not so good.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.811
Nathan's not good.
Nobody's good.

14:04.336 --> 14:06.980
I guess I should be in
church or something, but...

14:07.285 --> 14:09.341
somehow I ended up here.

14:10.765 --> 14:11.913
Hey.

14:12.466 --> 14:14.242
First time you
ever came in here,

14:14.257 --> 14:16.002
you remember what
you were looking for?

14:16.665 --> 14:18.800
No, and hopefully,
you don't, either.

14:18.815 --> 14:21.172
"Like a Stone" by Audioslave.

14:21.455 --> 14:23.731
At least, that's what you
said you were looking for.

14:23.747 --> 14:26.402
I kind of always thought you
were looking for a little faith.

14:26.836 --> 14:29.462
Most days,
I think you still are.

14:31.075 --> 14:33.590
Then again, I'm 32.
I live with my parents.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.562
What the hell do I know?

14:39.147 --> 14:42.573
I just want to believe
everything will be okay.

14:42.586 --> 14:46.400
Lucas and Haley and the baby --

14:46.416 --> 14:51.081
I just really, really want to
believe it's gonna be okay.

14:54.098 --> 14:55.552
Yeah, I know.

14:56.657 --> 14:58.541
I tell you what.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.062
Middle bin, four albums in --

15:01.077 --> 15:02.771
that's where your answers are.

15:07.447 --> 15:09.562
Latoya Jackson?

15:09.828 --> 15:12.092
All right, five albums in.

15:16.245 --> 15:17.992
La Rocca.

15:18.237 --> 15:19.781
Track 10.

15:19.887 --> 15:21.560
It's on me.

15:28.468 --> 15:29.710
And, Peyton...

15:32.038 --> 15:35.400
you're way too young not to
believe it's gonna be okay.

15:38.085 --> 15:39.572
Thank you.

16:09.838 --> 16:15.180
# Hey, do you take #
# the non believer? #

16:18.747 --> 16:22.370
# 'Cause I'm a non believer #

16:26.157 --> 16:30.273
# Do you take the non believer? #

16:33.956 --> 16:37.561
# 'Cause I'm a non believer #

16:41.225 --> 16:45.271
# Do you take the non believer? #

16:49.065 --> 16:53.563
# 'Cause I'm a non believer #

17:16.065 --> 17:21.060
Seeing your mom still
takes my breath away.

17:23.998 --> 17:26.500
Even though, technically,
you don't have any breath?

17:27.726 --> 17:31.413
I do.
I just saw myself in the hall.

17:31.627 --> 17:33.513
I guess I'm still
breathing for now.

17:33.526 --> 17:36.683
She feels guilty for
letting you play.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.870
It's  my fault.
I didn't take my pills.

17:41.885 --> 17:43.303
Yeah, you know what?

17:43.485 --> 17:46.243
That was a pretty stupid
thing to do, Luke.

17:47.877 --> 17:49.981
I was trying to win
a state championship.

17:49.998 --> 17:52.522
Anyway, are spirits allowed
to call people stupid?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.792
I'm dead.
I can say whatever the hell I want.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.310
Yeah, well,
it wasn't very nice.

17:56.436 --> 17:58.792
Not taking your
pills wasn't, either.

17:58.807 --> 18:01.570
Yes, I know that,
but you don't have to call me stupid.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.972
So...

18:08.036 --> 18:09.871
what if I don't wake up?

18:11.148 --> 18:12.982
I don't know. You tell me.

18:13.216 --> 18:15.043
You don't know.

18:15.058 --> 18:17.680
You know, for a spirit,
you suck at this.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.093
What do you want me to say?

18:19.105 --> 18:20.850
Well, I want to know
if there's a heaven.

18:20.866 --> 18:24.320
I want to know about eternal life
and all that stuff. I want to know...

18:26.127 --> 18:28.271
if we're ever gonna
see each other again.

18:31.338 --> 18:33.762
Well, we're seeing
each other now, right?

18:33.775 --> 18:35.463
Man, you really suck
at this, Keith.

18:35.475 --> 18:36.851
All right, get out.

18:39.957 --> 18:41.861
What are you in
such a hurry for?

18:41.927 --> 18:44.152
- We're running out of time.
- For what?

18:44.277 --> 18:46.080
The reason I came here.

18:53.157 --> 18:54.992
Why are we in the high school?

18:56.037 --> 18:57.251
Keith?

19:03.826 --> 19:06.852
Oh, god. What is this?

19:06.997 --> 19:09.291
I don't want to be seeing this.
Take it away. Take it away.

19:09.325 --> 19:10.761
What is this?

19:11.516 --> 19:14.212
This is where I was murdered, Luke.
You know that.

19:15.067 --> 19:18.101
But why are you showing this to me?
I don't want to see it.

19:19.786 --> 19:22.222
We got to talk about what
happened here, Lucas.

19:22.755 --> 19:25.031
There are things
you need to know.

19:33.538 --> 19:35.952
Do you remember what
you saw that day

19:36.058 --> 19:38.242
when you carried Peyton
out of the school?

19:40.176 --> 19:42.133
I saw Jimmy pointing
a gun at you.

19:42.985 --> 19:44.801
I still can't believe
he killed you.

19:44.815 --> 19:45.931
Then why do you?

19:46.345 --> 19:48.581
I shouldn't have gone
back into that school.

19:48.595 --> 19:51.461
No, you would still be alive
if I'd just stayed away.

19:51.475 --> 19:53.542
No, Luke, I wouldn't.

19:53.555 --> 19:55.091
How can you say that?

19:56.836 --> 19:58.692
You still can't see it,
can you?

20:00.756 --> 20:04.052
It's okay. You will.

20:33.847 --> 20:35.642
Thought I'd find you here.

20:39.908 --> 20:43.360
I remember when I found you
down here after your mom died.

20:43.656 --> 20:45.670
That was 8 years ago.

20:46.515 --> 20:48.922
You know Ellie used to
watch us down here?

20:49.568 --> 20:51.302
She told me that once.

20:56.436 --> 20:59.332
It's not gonna be like
that this time, Peyton.

21:00.795 --> 21:03.390
You're not gonna
lose Lucas and Haley

21:03.406 --> 21:05.960
the way you lost
Ellie and your mom.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.102
Or like I lost you?

21:12.807 --> 21:14.511
I miss you, Brooke.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.820
I'm still here. 

21:20.298 --> 21:23.660
Can we be friends
again? Please?

21:26.657 --> 21:27.920
Sure.

21:29.336 --> 21:30.981
Like before?

21:33.576 --> 21:37.522
I'm sorry, Peyton. I don't think so.
"Like before" is gone.

21:45.277 --> 21:46.322
Okay.

21:55.126 --> 21:57.160
Trust me, life's too short.

21:57.935 --> 22:01.981
Besides, no one ever lost any sleep
from being too kind or forgiving.

22:03.818 --> 22:06.072
That Brooke you showed
me at the school --

22:06.397 --> 22:09.882
she  was... so angry.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.191
What happened to this Brooke?

22:14.808 --> 22:16.593
You happened to her.

22:17.766 --> 22:19.152
What do you mean?

22:27.607 --> 22:30.341
Whose grave is she standing at?

22:30.745 --> 22:33.361
You never went back into
the school that day, Luke.

22:33.377 --> 22:37.333
At least the selfish version
of yourself never went back.

22:38.108 --> 22:40.000
Peyton died that day.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.733
Brooke never forgave herself
for leaving her behind.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.961
So, the next time you think that
being the best version of yourself

22:46.978 --> 22:50.003
doesn't matter,
you look into Peyton's eyes.

22:50.017 --> 22:52.821
And every time you do,
you'll know that it has...

22:52.955 --> 22:54.660
and it does.

22:55.245 --> 22:57.331
I don't like this world, Keith.

22:57.378 --> 22:59.013
I can't be here.

23:08.636 --> 23:10.262
You shouldn't be here, dad.

23:10.276 --> 23:13.102
- It is what it is, Nathan.
- Dad, I know what I did.

23:13.136 --> 23:15.622
Okay, you don't deserve this.
I'll turn myself in.

23:15.636 --> 23:17.612
- Nathan.
- We'll tell them about Daunte.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.920
He tried to run us down.
It was self-defense.

23:19.936 --> 23:21.233
All right, listen.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.142
Most of your life,
I've failed you as a father.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.012
Dad...

23:26.027 --> 23:27.611
I had the best of
intentions for you.

23:27.627 --> 23:30.060
But I haven't always
set the best example.

23:31.267 --> 23:33.403
In many ways,
I'm right where I should be.

23:33.415 --> 23:36.022
No, I don't believe that.

23:36.267 --> 23:39.361
You've made mistakes, dad.
We all have. But you didn't --

23:39.435 --> 23:41.511
you didn't kill anybody.

23:46.377 --> 23:47.420
Dad.

23:47.435 --> 23:48.711
How's Haley?

23:50.256 --> 23:52.002
She's out of surgery.

23:52.857 --> 23:54.171
And the baby?

23:55.498 --> 23:56.942
We don't know.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.112
It's a boy, by the way.

24:02.126 --> 24:04.012
It's supposed to be a boy.

24:04.675 --> 24:06.113
A son.

24:11.436 --> 24:12.982
Go on, son.

24:12.997 --> 24:15.523
Go be with your wife.
I'll be fine.

24:17.928 --> 24:19.130
Dad...

24:20.345 --> 24:21.702
I love you.

24:24.998 --> 24:26.193
Guard.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.571
No place like home.

24:41.025 --> 24:42.981
Man, I miss this old garage.

24:43.076 --> 24:45.170
This place was
pretty good to us.

24:45.847 --> 24:48.101
Seems like another
lifetime ago.

24:48.117 --> 24:51.241
Actually, it was
another lifetime ago.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.200
Peyton's car.

24:55.175 --> 24:56.433
Yeah.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.511
I remember when I sent
you on that service call.

25:00.806 --> 25:05.032
All you had to do was fill the radiator.
Could have done that on site.

25:05.077 --> 25:08.201
Yeah, I know.
I just wanted to see her again.

25:08.988 --> 25:12.332
She caught you looking at her sketches,
scared the hell out of both of us --

25:12.345 --> 25:15.043
all curly hair and venom.

25:18.466 --> 25:20.662
And you told her that
her art mattered,

25:20.755 --> 25:22.543
and she needed that.

25:22.688 --> 25:26.551
She needed the quiet satisfaction of
knowing that someone believed in her.

25:26.847 --> 25:28.643
I did believe in her.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.171
Yeah, but you didn't
have to say it.

25:31.186 --> 25:34.231
And you didn't have to
send her sketches to Thud.

25:34.248 --> 25:35.760
But you did.

25:35.777 --> 25:38.313
And because of that,
Peyton's a better person.

25:40.365 --> 25:43.813
You know, Luke,
it's an easy thing --

25:43.957 --> 25:46.511
saying "I love you"
to people who matter.

25:46.748 --> 25:49.001
You never know when
you might lose them...

25:49.546 --> 25:51.501
or when they might lose you.

26:01.336 --> 26:03.462
You're always saving me.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.821
Please let me find
a way to save you.

26:10.407 --> 26:14.643
# Forever and ever, amen #

26:18.046 --> 26:23.100
# Forever and ever, amen #

26:24.517 --> 26:26.050
Hey, baby.

26:27.398 --> 26:30.782
You know how you're always telling
me that you're not going anywhere?

26:31.628 --> 26:34.733
Well, I need to hold you
to that right now, okay?

26:35.656 --> 26:40.470
I just...
need you to come back to me.

26:43.268 --> 26:48.723
Listen, just move
one of your fingers

26:48.736 --> 26:50.930
if you can hear me, okay? 

26:51.757 --> 26:53.682
Just move one of those
beautiful fingers

26:53.697 --> 26:56.503
and let me know that
you're still here with me.

26:56.907 --> 27:01.020
# Forever and ever, amen #

27:03.808 --> 27:11.851
# Forever and ever amen #

00:00.006 --> 00:00.002
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,597
You picked the wrong
day to haunt me, Keith.

27:23.608 --> 27:25.102
Go away.

27:25.238 --> 27:28.492
Well, I'm afraid I
can't do that, Danny.

27:30.487 --> 27:33.851
Well,  well,
it's about time you showed up.

27:33.987 --> 27:37.190
The kid version of you is
just annoying at this point.

27:40.817 --> 27:43.362
You just gonna stand there,
or are you gonna say something?

27:45.298 --> 27:47.111
Suit yourself.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.430
Well, you know,
it won't go away, Danny.

27:50.105 --> 27:53.420
The guilt that you feel every
second of every day, the shame,

27:53.435 --> 27:55.831
it's just gonna keep
on getting worse.

27:56.768 --> 27:58.802
I made a mistake, okay?

27:59.075 --> 28:02.101
I'm trying to make it
right by protecting Nathan.

28:02.117 --> 28:03.771
From what?

28:05.268 --> 28:07.072
He killed Daunte.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.873
Are you sure about that, Danny?

28:08.886 --> 28:11.751
I was there. I know what I saw.

28:13.725 --> 28:17.421
I don't know, Danny. You've been
seeing a lot of things lately --

28:17.436 --> 28:20.881
painted walls and
strange e-mails.

28:20.897 --> 28:22.403
Dead brothers.

28:23.486 --> 28:26.923
Except you know what? Maybe I'm
not just in your head this time.

28:28.768 --> 28:32.302
You know,
she's never gonna love you, Danny.

28:33.845 --> 28:36.713
Hey, do you remember that
time mom and dad went out

28:36.727 --> 28:38.271
and left us home alone

28:38.286 --> 28:41.091
and you ran out in the back
yard and cut your hand?

28:41.106 --> 28:43.822
And dad beat the crap out of me because
I was supposed to be watching you.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.803
- Do you remember that?
- Stop it.

28:46.576 --> 28:51.442
Or how about the time that
you got Karen pregnant

28:51.457 --> 28:53.823
and you abandoned her?
Do you remember that?

28:53.838 --> 28:55.220
Shut up!

28:55.586 --> 28:59.902
Or how about the time that you
murdered me? Do you remember that?

28:59.916 --> 29:02.412
I said shut up!
What the hell do you want?

29:02.426 --> 29:04.173
Just tell me what you want.

29:05.628 --> 29:08.432
There's something I never
had a chance to tell you.

29:09.207 --> 29:11.013
I forgive you.

29:12.146 --> 29:13.761
Take it back.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.152
Look, I forgive you, Danny.

29:16.377 --> 29:18.760
- You take that back.
- I said I forgive you.

29:18.777 --> 29:21.013
You take that back,
you son of a bitch!

29:21.027 --> 29:23.281
I forgive you, little brother.

29:25.247 --> 29:27.033
I forgive you.

29:31.428 --> 29:33.073
Guard!

29:33.235 --> 29:35.393
But hell won't.

29:45.425 --> 29:47.423
Strange, isn't it?

29:47.465 --> 29:51.071
Each man's life touches
so many other lives.

29:51.087 --> 29:54.193
When he isn't around,
he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

29:54.207 --> 29:55.353
I've heard of things like this.

29:55.387 --> 29:57.020
You've got me in some kind
of a spell or something.

29:57.057 --> 29:59.333
Well, I'm gonna get out of it.
I'll get out of it.

29:59.348 --> 30:01.170
And I know how, too.

30:01.347 --> 30:04.311
The last man I talked to before
all this stuff started happening...

30:05.367 --> 30:07.503
Hey, it's me.

30:15.655 --> 30:17.301
Hey, it's me.

30:19.808 --> 30:22.060
Look, I know you've got
a lot going on right now,

30:22.077 --> 30:26.963
and just so you know,
Karen is a mess.

30:28.147 --> 30:29.943
Nathan's a mess.

30:30.818 --> 30:33.382
But you got to wake up soon.

30:34.537 --> 30:36.851
'Cause I need you to
take care of Brooke.

30:38.156 --> 30:41.942
You've got to wake up soon because
I need you to take care of Peyton.

30:43.507 --> 30:46.373
I just --
I can't do it anymore.

30:48.067 --> 30:51.103
And it's not like we can
leave her with Rachel.

30:52.405 --> 30:54.801
Besides, you're
really good for her.

30:55.445 --> 30:58.593
And I'm not sure she can
find her way without you.

31:00.678 --> 31:02.522
What do you say?

31:02.666 --> 31:05.253
How about you wake
up and help her out?

31:08.036 --> 31:11.420
Oh, and could... you not tell
her we had this conversation?

31:12.825 --> 31:14.373
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

31:26.705 --> 31:28.483
It's okay, Nathan.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.301
Just breathe.

31:30.475 --> 31:32.593
It's gonna be okay.

31:36.897 --> 31:40.193
I know I did a
horrible thing, okay?

31:42.337 --> 31:45.571
But I deserve to be punished for that,
not Haley.

31:45.915 --> 31:48.093
She's a good person.

31:48.165 --> 31:50.533
She'd be a great mother if...

31:55.915 --> 31:59.693
Look, I know it must suck how people
are always asking you for things

31:59.706 --> 32:01.613
and never giving anything back.

32:02.536 --> 32:06.802
And I know that Keith
saved me at that bridge,

32:06.845 --> 32:11.512
but Haley saved me long
before the accident.

32:12.666 --> 32:16.983
There has to be a miracle
left for her. Please.

32:18.988 --> 32:20.563
Please.

32:21.967 --> 32:24.243
Don't take her from me.

32:26.198 --> 32:28.790
Don't take our child from her.

32:32.608 --> 32:36.240
It's okay, Nathan.
Just breathe.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.730
It's gonna be okay.

32:42.478 --> 32:43.952
Nathan.

32:53.878 --> 32:55.610
Hi.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.801
Hi.

33:17.458 --> 33:21.503
Jeez, what's a guy got to do to
get some flowers now and then?

33:21.516 --> 33:22.810
Sorry.

33:22.828 --> 33:26.173
My mom really wants to come,
but it's just hard for her.

33:26.187 --> 33:27.803
What about you?

33:29.337 --> 33:31.670
I just figured it
was a waste of time.

33:35.048 --> 33:39.520
Look, I didn't believe Nathan
when he said that you rescued him

33:39.536 --> 33:42.370
because I didn't
believe in you.

33:44.075 --> 33:47.203
When you died,
I didn't believe in the idea of you.

33:47.855 --> 33:49.651
It's okay, Luke.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.200
I didn't come here to
make you believe in me.

33:52.215 --> 33:54.633
I came here to make
you believe in you.

33:56.757 --> 34:00.233
You know... you got a lot of
good things in this life, Luke.

34:00.248 --> 34:04.153
You got family, friends, love.

34:04.218 --> 34:07.052
Those are the things that
are worth believing in.

34:14.405 --> 34:17.922
Is there a heaven, Keith?

34:19.437 --> 34:21.440
I don't know. Is there?

34:22.588 --> 34:24.742
You know,
you really suck at this.

34:28.277 --> 34:32.751
Because if there is, I was kind of
wondering if I could go with you.

34:33.918 --> 34:35.902
Well, Luke, that's up to you.

34:35.917 --> 34:39.342
The future right
now is unwritten.

34:39.848 --> 34:42.302
But I want you to understand --

34:43.016 --> 34:46.230
if you go back, there are
gonna be tough times, you know?

34:46.335 --> 34:48.560
Some heartache and pain.

34:48.577 --> 34:52.190
But there's also gonna be love, laughter,
and a life full of accomplishment.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.661
It's up to you.

34:58.576 --> 35:01.253
Who's the woman at
Peyton's grave?

35:01.568 --> 35:03.862
Someone who used to know her.

35:04.587 --> 35:06.750
But it's not Peyton's grave.

35:07.298 --> 35:08.743
What do you mean?

35:09.617 --> 35:12.430
Well, Peyton lived because
you saved her that day.

35:13.608 --> 35:16.562
Then whose grave is it?

35:16.998 --> 35:21.460
It's your grave, Luke,
if that's what you choose.

35:33.777 --> 35:35.931
And the woman?

35:44.035 --> 35:45.731
Peyton.

35:46.168 --> 35:48.481
She lived a good life, Luke.

35:49.368 --> 35:51.652
But she could never
let go of you.

36:13.898 --> 36:15.822
I have to go back.

36:19.028 --> 36:20.340
You sure?

36:22.158 --> 36:24.590
I never told Peyton I love her.

36:25.486 --> 36:27.090
I want to go back.

36:28.256 --> 36:29.813
Okay.

36:31.296 --> 36:32.603
Well...

36:34.307 --> 36:36.403
I guess this is the hard part.

36:36.706 --> 36:37.833
Keith...

36:37.847 --> 36:40.220
Luke, you know I love you,

36:40.237 --> 36:41.822
and I always will.

36:42.725 --> 36:44.670
But I'm afraid it's
time for me to go.

36:44.686 --> 36:47.373
- I don't want you to go.
- Luke, it's okay.

36:50.635 --> 36:54.691
God... I am gonna
miss you so much.

36:54.755 --> 36:56.093
Why?

36:56.337 --> 36:57.992
I'm with you every day.

37:02.795 --> 37:04.590
I'm with you every day.

37:11.387 --> 37:15.362
Besides we'll see
each other again.

37:16.005 --> 37:17.500
We will?

37:18.905 --> 37:20.692
You believe that.

37:24.687 --> 37:26.072
Now, uh...

37:27.948 --> 37:29.860
this is gonna hurt
a little bit.

37:31.348 --> 37:33.150
I love you, kid.

37:44.858 --> 37:46.390
I got a heartbeat.

37:49.446 --> 37:52.951
It's okay, Lucas. Just breathe.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.911
It's gonna be okay.

38:04.045 --> 38:07.583
# She belongs somewhere else #

38:07.598 --> 38:11.302
# Away from my side #

38:11.317 --> 38:15.162
# So run with what you've got #

38:15.175 --> 38:18.993
# And chase with what you need #

38:19.088 --> 38:22.450
# I believe the faithful fail #

38:23.748 --> 38:26.472
You understand there are
no guarantees in medicine,

38:26.487 --> 38:29.480
but as long as we can
locate a heartbeat,

38:29.497 --> 38:33.500
there's no reason to expect that this
baby won't be perfectly healthy.

38:33.705 --> 38:37.600
# Is it mine? Is it mine? #

38:41.098 --> 38:45.163
# Is it mine? Is it mine? #

38:50.838 --> 38:54.913
# Do you take the non believer? #

38:58.418 --> 39:02.453
# 'Cause I'm a non believer #

39:08.746 --> 39:11.673
Have you ever wondered what
marks our time here...

39:13.746 --> 39:17.371
...if one life can really make
an impact on the world...

39:20.368 --> 39:23.161
...or if the choices
we make matter?

39:26.088 --> 39:28.242
I believe they do.

39:29.858 --> 39:33.703
And I believe that one
man can change many lives.

39:33.908 --> 39:36.981
For better... or worse.

39:36.997 --> 39:39.643
I still don't believe that
Jimmy killed you, Keith.

39:39.655 --> 39:41.823
Well, then why do you?

39:41.838 --> 39:44.072
Jimmy Edwards was
your friend, Luke.

39:44.087 --> 39:46.772
You knew him.
You were kind to him.

39:46.787 --> 39:51.681
After everything we've seen, don't you
think that that kindness had an impact?

39:51.717 --> 39:53.953
But if it did,
then you would still be alive.

39:53.965 --> 39:55.873
Do you really
believe that, Luke?

39:55.888 --> 39:58.833
Look into your heart, okay?

39:58.847 --> 40:01.492
It may be flawed physically,
but it's a good one,

40:01.507 --> 40:03.811
and it's what makes you you.

40:03.825 --> 40:07.380
Look, you've changed other
people's lives by opening it up.

40:07.395 --> 40:09.881
Don't close that off.

40:10.635 --> 40:13.713
Luke, just look around this hallway.
You were here that day.

40:13.725 --> 40:15.253
What did you see?

40:15.618 --> 40:17.583
I didn't see anything.

40:17.598 --> 40:19.560
Open your eyes, Luke.

40:20.168 --> 40:23.800
Open your eyes the way
you've opened your heart.

40:24.645 --> 40:26.370
Open your eyes, Luke.

40:29.466 --> 40:31.400
Open your eyes, Luke.

40:32.817 --> 40:34.683
Open your eyes.

40:35.108 --> 40:37.261
Open your eyes, Luke.

40:37.608 --> 40:40.170
Open your eyes, Lucas.
