05:15.780 --> 05:19.310
<b>I didn't hear a single word.</b>

05:19.380 --> 05:20.920

05:41.070 --> 05:44.210

<b>- That's all he's known.</b>

05:44.270 --> 05:46.380
<b>Since he was, like, six months,</b>
<b>it's just Luke.</b>

05:46.440 --> 05:49.080

05:49.110 --> 05:51.880

07:47.360 --> 07:49.330

38:55.830 --> 38:58.300
<b>- I have not heard from Stephan</b>
<b>in over a year.</b>

38:58.360 --> 39:01.630
<b>This is the first time.</b>
<b>So I didn't keep Izaiah away.</b>

39:01.700 --> 39:03.840
<b>Stephan made that decision</b>
<b>on his own.</b>

39:08.240 --> 39:10.180
<b>- All right, let me talk to you</b>
<b>a little too.</b>

39:10.240 --> 39:11.510
<b>- Huh?</b>

39:11.580 --> 39:13.280

<b>- What you mean</b>

<b>He ain't been doing [bleep].</b>

39:17.850 --> 39:19.320
<b>He hasn't been talking to her</b>
<b>for over two years, bro.</b>

39:19.390 --> 39:21.050
<b>And then all of a sudden</b>
<b>it's supposed to be okay.</b>

39:21.120 --> 39:22.660
<b>He want her to jump up</b>
<b>10 feet high and start talking.</b>

39:22.720 --> 39:23.820
<b>- Nah, I'm saying, bro,</b>
<b>it ain't that.</b>

39:23.890 --> 39:25.060
<b>I'm saying at least let him</b>

39:26.460 --> 39:29.160

<b>You'll let him know,</b>

39:29.230 --> 39:31.430
