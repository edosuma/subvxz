<i> ( lighthearted music plays )</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:13.278
Woman:<i> Some friendships</i>
<i> are so important,</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:15.213
<i> You'd do anything</i>
<i> to make them last.</i>

00:15.215 --> 00:18.783
<i> That's why ely and I created</i>
<i> the no-kiss list.</i>

00:18.785 --> 00:21.652
<i>What exactly is a no-kiss list,</i>
<i> you ask?</i>

00:21.654 --> 00:23.353
<i> Well, hold on a second.</i>
<i> I'll get there.</i>

00:23.355 --> 00:25.788
<i> ( record scratches,</i>
<i> rock music plays )</i>

00:30.694 --> 00:32.760
Muggies,
late for school.

00:35.631 --> 00:37.097
- No.
- No.

00:37.099 --> 00:38.631
- Switch.
- Yeah, switch.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.499
Mm, much better.

00:43.470 --> 00:48.239
Oh, by the way, student revolt,
classes cancelled.

00:48.241 --> 00:51.342
- That sucks. Oh, well.
- So funny, pinocchio.

00:51.344 --> 00:53.177
Any more,
you're gonna need a nose job.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.179
Woman:<i> One thing</i>
<i> you should know about me...</i>

00:55.181 --> 00:57.381
18 years of apartment living,
and you still believe pressing

00:57.383 --> 01:00.450
- The down button speeds up
the elevator's arrival.
- Implicitly.

01:00.452 --> 01:02.652
<i> ...I lie all the time.</i>

01:02.654 --> 01:04.654
Good morning, mrs. Loy.

01:04.656 --> 01:07.089
<i> I lied to mrs. Loy</i>
<i> that I walked her dog</i>

01:07.091 --> 01:09.391
<i>Three times a day when she went</i>
<i> to atlantic city.</i>

01:09.393 --> 01:12.761
<i> But honestly,</i>
<i> I think that dog hates me.</i>

01:12.763 --> 01:14.529
- Close it. Close it.
- Close it!

01:14.531 --> 01:18.666
Good morning,
mr. Mcallister.

01:23.639 --> 01:27.574
( grunts indistinct words,
laughs )

01:27.576 --> 01:29.075
Bam.

01:34.815 --> 01:36.714
Let's do this.

01:43.756 --> 01:46.323
I like it.

01:46.325 --> 01:50.160
Love it.
Hello.

01:50.162 --> 01:51.728
<i> I lie to myself</i>
<i> that it's meaningless</i>

01:51.730 --> 01:53.696
<i> When I don't tell ely</i>
<i> that gabriel,</i>

01:53.698 --> 01:56.098
<i> The beautiful new doorman,</i>
<i> may occasionally text me.</i>

01:56.100 --> 01:58.567
- Hey, how's it going?
-<i> And I lied to bruce the first</i>

01:58.569 --> 02:01.469
<i> When I let him let him he ever</i>
<i> had a shot at being my first.</i>

02:01.471 --> 02:03.537
I hope the day
continues to be good.

02:03.539 --> 02:06.873
If it hasn't been good
then I hope it changes--

02:06.875 --> 02:08.674
All right.
Step aside, kids.

02:08.676 --> 02:11.643
- Bye, boys. Bye!
- Have a great day.

02:11.645 --> 02:14.746
( laughs )
well, that was fun.

02:14.748 --> 02:16.347
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:16.349 --> 02:19.483
- We're going this way.
- Oh, take me away!

02:23.388 --> 02:25.354
Man:<i> ( german accent )</i>
<i>fraulein, have you ever noticed</i>

02:25.356 --> 02:27.656
That gabriel's left eye
is greener than his right?

02:27.658 --> 02:29.624
( laughs )
ely, you insult me.

02:29.626 --> 02:32.660
What are you taking me for,
some sort of amateur
doorman stalker?

02:32.662 --> 02:35.496
That's only the 37th thing
I love most about him.

02:35.498 --> 02:38.499
Oh, my god, naomi, remind me to
introduce you to this guy.

02:38.501 --> 02:41.435
Freshman film freak,
goes by the name of, uh,

02:41.437 --> 02:42.903
Bruce the second.

02:42.905 --> 02:46.306
- He's your boyfriend.
- Oh. Right. Him,

02:46.308 --> 02:48.408
But gabriel's
just so gaze-worthy.

02:48.410 --> 02:51.376
Okay. Clearly, gabriel belongs
on the no-kiss list.

02:54.848 --> 02:57.281
Fast, fast,
don't get hit by a moped.

02:57.283 --> 03:00.584
- All right, keep up.
- You check the news.
I'll stock up on snacks.

03:00.586 --> 03:02.452
Why discriminate?
You know what I mean?

03:02.454 --> 03:04.754
The no-kiss list is meant
for all truly,

03:04.756 --> 03:08.691
Madly kissable boys,
like robert pattison.

03:08.693 --> 03:11.260
It hurts knowing that person's
lips will never touch yours

03:11.262 --> 03:16.364
Because of our ever-so-sacred
vow of no-kissing lists.

03:16.366 --> 03:17.865
- Bye!
- Bye!

03:17.867 --> 03:19.733
This is a new song, otis?

03:19.735 --> 03:21.201
Sure is, sweet baby.

03:21.203 --> 03:22.368
Oh, I love it.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.472
¶ let me tell you, baby,
what it is I'm looking for ¶

03:27.474 --> 03:28.739
There you go, baby.

03:28.741 --> 03:30.540
¶ ain't more than a little bit ¶

03:30.542 --> 03:33.910
¶ so if you got it, baby,
I'll adore you... ¶

03:33.912 --> 03:36.879
I'll walk you to class if we
can take the scenic route.

03:36.881 --> 03:40.582
<i> And I lied to ely</i>
<i> that I'm okay with gay.</i>

03:40.584 --> 03:42.450
Ely:<i> Do you see</i>
<i> that one on the left?</i>

03:44.554 --> 03:50.190
Naomi:<i> I am.</i>
<i> Just... Not for him.</i>

03:50.192 --> 03:52.258
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.793
Naomi, it's not high school
anymore, okay?

03:54.795 --> 03:56.728
Have you seen the wreckage
of our lives, lately.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.763
Seems psych might
be good for the soul.

03:58.765 --> 04:00.564
Go in there.
Show 'em who's boss.

04:00.566 --> 04:02.566
It's 110% you.

04:02.568 --> 04:03.967
- You're beautiful.
I love you.
- Come with me.

04:03.969 --> 04:06.469
No. I can't. You got this.
It's all on you.

04:06.471 --> 04:10.339
- Go. Go. Go. Git!
- Oh! No!

04:10.341 --> 04:12.874
I don't wanna go!

04:12.876 --> 04:15.676
- Hug me.
- No. No. No. Back.

04:15.678 --> 04:17.844
Come. ( groans )

04:21.482 --> 04:23.248
( both laugh )

04:28.487 --> 04:31.421
<i> Oh, I lied to the nyu</i>
<i> admissions committee</i>

04:31.423 --> 04:34.557
<i> When I told them I had</i>
<i> a vision for my future.</i>

04:34.559 --> 04:39.494
<i> Six weeks in,</i>
<i> and I can barely see straight.</i>

04:39.496 --> 04:41.963
Naomi, over here!
I saved you a seat.

04:41.965 --> 04:43.698
Thanks, robin.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.400
Woman:<i> Good morning,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen.</i>

04:46.402 --> 04:50.437
We will be re-examining
chapter five in our textbook...

04:50.439 --> 04:53.572
Oh, crap.
Ely always gives me a pen.

04:55.275 --> 04:56.474
Thank you.

04:56.476 --> 04:59.510
<i> Access chapter five,</i>
<i> page...</i>

04:59.512 --> 05:01.478
Naomi:
<i> You wanna know why I lie</i>

05:01.480 --> 05:05.348
<i> And what exactly ely meant</i>
<i> by the wreckage of our lives?</i>

05:05.350 --> 05:09.518
<i> There's ely,</i>
<i> already making me feel better.</i>

05:09.520 --> 05:12.954
<i> Ely and I have lived next door</i>
<i> to each other our whole lives.</i>

05:12.956 --> 05:15.990
<i> I was there when his moms</i>
<i> could finally get married.</i>

05:15.992 --> 05:19.526
<i> They may look happy here,</i>
<i>but it became a total shit show</i>

05:19.528 --> 05:23.696
<i> When my dad had an affair</i>
<i> with ely's mom, jenny.</i>

05:23.698 --> 05:26.899
<i> The moms marriage survived...</i>
<i> Somehow,</i>

05:26.901 --> 05:30.035
<i> But my parents' didn't.</i>

05:30.037 --> 05:33.972
<i>So I started lying to my mom to</i>
<i>tell her she'd make it through.</i>

05:33.974 --> 05:35.673
<i> It's not that I don't think</i>
<i> she can.</i>

05:35.675 --> 05:37.708
I just don't think
she wants to wake

05:37.710 --> 05:40.544
<i> From the pharmaceutical haze</i>
<i>she's been ever since dad left.</i>

05:40.546 --> 05:44.047
<i> But ely and I</i>
<i> will always have each other.</i>

05:44.049 --> 05:46.783
<i> We're city kids who never had</i>
<i> big backyards,</i>

05:46.785 --> 05:49.285
<i> So we built our</i>
<i> own urban tree house</i>

05:49.287 --> 05:51.920
<i> On top of the stairwell</i>
<i> in our building.</i>

05:51.922 --> 05:54.522
<i> It's our private</i>
<i> hallowed ground.</i>

05:54.524 --> 05:57.691
Professor:
<i> Miss? Miss? Hello?</i>

06:00.028 --> 06:02.962
Are you finding it difficult
to concentrate

06:02.964 --> 06:05.964
<i> On our discussion of freud</i>
<i> and the unconscious?</i>

06:08.768 --> 06:11.769
Well, it may have appeared
that I was zoning out.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.772
I was actually exploring
the very power

06:14.774 --> 06:19.543
Of my unconscious.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.311
Is that so?

06:21.313 --> 06:23.713
Yes? ( chuckles )

06:23.715 --> 06:27.316
Paper lions:
<i> ¶ she made a move on me</i>
<i> after I let a fire... ¶</i>

06:27.318 --> 06:29.751
-<i> ( telephone line rings ) </i>
- ely:<i> Hey, boo.</i>

06:29.753 --> 06:31.619
Yaffa cafe, stat.

06:31.621 --> 06:33.954
I-I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

06:33.956 --> 06:36.756
Ely, seriously, come on, please,
I need to talk to you.

06:36.758 --> 06:38.858
<i> My professor</i>
<i> just totally chewed me out.</i>

06:38.860 --> 06:41.060
<i> It was humiliating.</i>
<i> Be in there in five.</i>

06:41.062 --> 06:43.095
Fine.
I'll see you in ten.

06:43.097 --> 06:47.932
<i> ¶ peel away</i>
<i> my thickest skin ¶</i>

06:49.869 --> 06:55.538
<i> ¶ I hesitate</i>
<i> and you pull me in ¶</i>

06:55.540 --> 06:57.940
<i> ¶ pull me in ¶</i>

06:57.942 --> 07:01.910
<i> ¶ pull me I-I-n... ¶</i>

07:06.049 --> 07:08.883
Bruce, are you seriously
gonna do that all semester?

07:08.885 --> 07:11.418
What? I'm just trying
to capture your essence.

07:13.622 --> 07:15.989
Oh, did I tell you?

07:15.991 --> 07:19.392
I think I decided on a title
for my student film.

07:19.394 --> 07:22.728
"hot child in the city."

07:22.730 --> 07:24.129
Hot.

07:25.899 --> 07:27.632
Oh, no, that's for ely!

07:27.634 --> 07:29.367
Oh.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.502
That's... Cool.

07:31.504 --> 07:34.705
Uh, I got orson welles.
I'll call you later?

07:34.707 --> 07:36.473
Yeah. Sure.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.079
Hi, bruce.

07:44.081 --> 07:45.580
Bye, bruce.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.583
So glad you're here.

07:49.585 --> 07:51.952
I never noticed b2
had such good teeth.

07:51.954 --> 07:53.753
Huh?

07:53.755 --> 07:55.654
( playing jazz riffs )

07:57.791 --> 07:59.791
Trust me.
Follow me.

07:59.793 --> 08:01.125
Where are we going?

08:01.127 --> 08:04.394
Quit complaining.

08:04.396 --> 08:07.063
I think
we should get married here.

08:07.065 --> 08:09.932
Well, you make me swoon from
the gritty romance of it all,

08:09.934 --> 08:12.701
But what happened to the temple
of dendur at the met?

08:12.703 --> 08:14.936
This time, I don't mean you
and me getting married.

08:14.938 --> 08:18.039
I mean, me and he.

08:18.041 --> 08:20.441
Man:
<i> ¶ I just wanna touch you ¶</i>

08:20.443 --> 08:22.843
<i> ¶ let me sit back... ¶</i>

08:22.845 --> 08:25.178
Naomi:
<i> Mediocre doorman by night...</i>

08:25.180 --> 08:27.446
<i> Superstar baller by day.</i>

08:27.448 --> 08:29.481
- Good god.
- Both:<i> Sigh.</i>

08:29.483 --> 08:32.617
- ( chuckles )
- god, he's great with balls.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.052
Gabriel so belongs
on the no-kiss list,

08:35.054 --> 08:37.587
But bottom standing
will not suffice.

08:37.589 --> 08:38.854
Yeah, but where the hell
do we put him then?

08:38.856 --> 08:40.622
Because obviously
donnie weisberger

08:40.624 --> 08:41.889
Remains a non-negotiable
number one.

08:41.891 --> 08:43.624
- Obv.
- Yeah.

08:43.626 --> 08:46.426
Rumor has it he's doing
habitat for humanity crap

08:46.428 --> 08:48.161
In guatemala dodging
the drug rap

08:48.163 --> 08:50.663
- From the senior skip day
'shroom fiasco.
- Yeah?

08:50.665 --> 08:53.999
- Donnie. Donnie. I miss him.
- Yea, gabriel maybe new,

08:54.001 --> 08:57.802
- But he's hotter
than everyone else.
- Agreed.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.939
<i> Get it in. Come on.</i>
<i> Come on. Oh, yes.</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:03.107
And george says
he's in a band.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.242
Oh, my god.
That's even hotter.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.977
Mm-hmm.

09:06.979 --> 09:10.146
Well, then,
welcome gabriel

09:10.148 --> 09:14.717
To number two on
the no-kiss list. Mwah.

09:14.719 --> 09:17.186
Let us never forget
the importance of declaring

09:17.188 --> 09:19.087
Certain hottie mchot boys
off-limits.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.888
( scoffs ) fine.

09:20.890 --> 09:24.024
It is the official insurance
against naomi and ely breakup.

09:24.026 --> 09:27.093
- I guess.
- Friendship where we never
fight over guys...

09:27.095 --> 09:31.063
- Is a friendship
that lasts forever,
- exactly.

09:31.065 --> 09:35.300
Done.
Gabriel is off-limits.

09:35.302 --> 09:37.601
If only our parents
had a no-kiss list.

09:40.939 --> 09:43.205
Then maybe my dad wouldn't live
not in the building anymore,

09:43.207 --> 09:46.241
Far, far away.

09:46.243 --> 09:48.976
And mom susan wouldn't still
be sleeping on the couch?

09:51.847 --> 09:53.880
<i> ( deluka's</i>
<i> "the only ones" plays )</i>

09:56.718 --> 09:59.085
-<i> ¶ I'm trying hard here ¶ </i>
- got you.

09:59.087 --> 10:01.921
<i> ¶ I give you all that I got ¶</i>

10:01.923 --> 10:05.024
<i> ¶ yeah, yeah,</i>
<i> whoa, whoa ¶</i>

10:05.026 --> 10:07.126
Uh-huh, uh-huh, all you.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.928
Call me. I'll call you.
We'll meet up later.

10:09.930 --> 10:12.030
Oh, no, thank<i> you.</i>

10:13.767 --> 10:15.833
- Smack that ass.
- Oh! Hey!

10:17.803 --> 10:19.803
( speaks indistinctly )

10:19.805 --> 10:22.038
Thank you.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.939
( song continues on stereo )

10:23.941 --> 10:25.173
Ely:<i> Shake that. Shake it.</i>
<i> Shake it.</i>

10:25.175 --> 10:27.942
Swerving on it.
It's hard-core.

10:27.944 --> 10:31.078
( both laughing,
music stops )

10:31.080 --> 10:33.613
Oh, my god.

10:33.615 --> 10:36.048
- Did you like that?
- Oh, I loved that.

10:36.050 --> 10:38.817
- God.
- ( sighs )

10:38.819 --> 10:40.852
Do you know why I love you?

10:40.854 --> 10:44.121
Because of my uncanny ability
to wiggle my eyebrows?

10:44.123 --> 10:46.256
Oh, my god.

10:46.258 --> 10:48.358
That is<i> fascinating.</i>

10:48.360 --> 10:51.294
And also because...

10:51.296 --> 10:53.963
When I feel like sticking
my head in an oven,

10:53.965 --> 10:55.297
You pull it out,

10:55.299 --> 10:57.265
And you put cookies
in there instead.

10:57.267 --> 10:58.366
That was sweet.

10:58.368 --> 11:00.167
Mm, thanks.

11:00.169 --> 11:02.068
Check it.
Check it.

11:02.070 --> 11:04.036
( indie rock plays )

11:04.038 --> 11:06.238
All right, let's see,
what do we got for tonight?

11:06.240 --> 11:08.240
- Um...
-<i> ( cell phone chimes )</i>

11:08.242 --> 11:10.942
Apples to apples,...

11:10.944 --> 11:13.411
Trouble...

11:13.413 --> 11:15.813
What do you wanna do?

11:15.815 --> 11:19.349
( gasps )
let's eat cookie dough.

11:19.351 --> 11:21.050
I got a 911.

11:21.052 --> 11:24.053
Mama g.

11:24.055 --> 11:26.722
Yeah.

11:26.724 --> 11:29.257
Gotta go do damage control.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.158
( sighs deeply )

11:33.428 --> 11:35.227
I love you.

11:35.229 --> 11:36.761
Meeya more.

11:57.316 --> 12:02.885
And you said this was, um,
all locally grown organically?

12:02.887 --> 12:05.220
I'm glad<i> somebody</i> noticed.

12:05.222 --> 12:08.323
Forgive me for having
a deposition in the morning.

12:08.325 --> 12:11.859
I take it couples counseling
went well today?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.160
Hmm.

12:26.341 --> 12:28.240
Hey, mom.

12:28.242 --> 12:31.042
- Hi, baby.
- You hungry?

12:31.044 --> 12:32.843
I was thinking
of ordering chinese.

12:32.845 --> 12:34.411
Look how thin I was there.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.716
Am I in any of these
with you?

12:41.718 --> 12:43.117
These were
before you were born.

12:47.289 --> 12:50.356
Here's some of me.

12:50.358 --> 12:52.224
I look so much like dad here.

12:52.226 --> 12:55.794
The selfish bastard's not even
gonna send money this month.

12:55.796 --> 12:59.764
We'll still be okay,
right?

12:59.766 --> 13:01.065
I don't know.

13:01.067 --> 13:04.368
Maybe I'll start
a jewelry business.

13:04.370 --> 13:07.204
What do you know
about jewelry?

13:07.206 --> 13:11.508
Remember that beading set
you got for christmas?

13:11.510 --> 13:15.111
I played with it
a lot more than you did.

13:23.988 --> 13:25.988
Can't sleep again?

13:28.459 --> 13:31.827
Well, at least you're
working things out.

13:31.829 --> 13:33.328
That's what counts.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.196
<i> Thanks.</i>

13:35.198 --> 13:37.398
- I think he's in his room.
- Okay.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.471
¶

14:21.408 --> 14:26.310
( muttering indistinctly )

14:26.312 --> 14:28.979
- Sats?
- Yes.

14:28.981 --> 14:31.581
Floxinoxinihilipilification.

14:31.583 --> 14:33.349
I don't have that.

14:33.351 --> 14:36.552
The estimation that something
is valueless.

14:36.554 --> 14:39.488
Thank you for that very cheerful
bit of wisdom,

14:39.490 --> 14:40.589
Mr. Mcallister.

14:40.591 --> 14:42.123
Soporific.
Soporific.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.357
Quack.

14:43.359 --> 14:44.891
<i> Excuse me?</i>

14:44.893 --> 14:49.295
It means, like, a poser.
It was on my sats.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.929
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't realize

14:50.931 --> 14:53.298
You had to take the sats
to get into doorman school.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.434
No. It was for--

14:56.436 --> 14:58.969
Forget it.

14:58.971 --> 15:00.537
Why aren't you sleeping?

15:00.539 --> 15:02.572
I tried it all--
ambien,

15:02.574 --> 15:05.975
Counting sheep, weed,
obviously,

15:05.977 --> 15:08.377
- Complete works of dotoevsky
-<i> dostoyevsky.</i>

15:08.379 --> 15:11.146
Don't care.
I jerked off for a while.

15:11.148 --> 15:13.381
Okay.
That's-- that's plenty.

15:13.383 --> 15:15.383
How long has this
been going on for?

15:15.385 --> 15:16.550
A while.

15:16.552 --> 15:18.318
I blame naomi.

15:20.121 --> 15:22.121
I was five.
She was seven.

15:22.123 --> 15:23.889
We were left alone
in the elevator together

15:23.891 --> 15:26.324
Completely unattended,
and she lifts up her skirt

15:26.326 --> 15:28.359
And sticks her tongue
out at me.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.897
And?

15:33.899 --> 15:37.433
And my heart completely
leaped out of my chest.

15:37.435 --> 15:41.403
Naomi has owned it
ever since.

15:41.405 --> 15:44.572
Wasn't that like
ten years ago?

15:44.574 --> 15:46.407
<i> And doesn't she have</i>
<i> a boyfriend now?</i>

15:46.409 --> 15:48.409
If you're referring to bruce 2,
then technically, yes,

15:48.411 --> 15:51.278
But I know that I shall
forever be

15:51.280 --> 15:53.113
Bruce 1 to her
in every way.

15:53.115 --> 15:56.916
Bruce 2,
I laugh at you.

15:56.918 --> 15:59.952
Oh, plus, just last spring,
we're back in our same elevator,

15:59.954 --> 16:02.955
<i> She's eating a snickers bar.</i>

16:02.957 --> 16:04.222
( moans )

16:04.224 --> 16:06.224
<i> She leans into me,</i>
<i> and kisses me,</i>

16:06.226 --> 16:11.061
<i> Completely sucking my soul</i>
<i> out of my body and into hers.</i>

16:11.063 --> 16:14.497
<i> ¶ let me taste your honey ¶</i>

16:14.499 --> 16:17.233
<i> ¶ I need more,</i>
<i> I can't get enough of you ¶</i>

16:17.235 --> 16:20.202
-<i> ¶ let me taste your honey ¶ </i>
-<i> ( elevator dings )</i>

16:20.204 --> 16:22.103
<i> ¶ so hot,</i>
<i> you know just want I need ¶</i>

16:22.105 --> 16:23.537
See ya.

16:23.539 --> 16:25.272
Have a good night.

16:25.274 --> 16:28.575
I love the taste of snickers.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.147
<i> ( door opens )</i>

16:34.149 --> 16:35.181
<i> ( door closes )</i>

16:50.464 --> 16:52.497
( whispers ) naomi.

17:05.478 --> 17:06.577
Ely!

17:06.579 --> 17:08.445
( laughs )

17:08.447 --> 17:10.413
Where the eff were you?

17:10.415 --> 17:12.081
<i> I love that you worry.</i>

17:12.083 --> 17:14.116
I texted you, like,
37,000 times.

17:14.118 --> 17:17.018
Happy hour had a happy ending.

17:17.020 --> 17:20.320
I made out with
the hello hottie.

17:22.390 --> 17:25.190
You're giving me that same look
you gave me when I told you

17:25.192 --> 17:26.690
Whole foods stopped carrying
chocolate-chip bagels.

17:29.327 --> 17:31.627
Fine.

17:31.629 --> 17:34.563
It's just...

17:34.565 --> 17:37.666
Since when do you go around
kissing random guys?

17:37.668 --> 17:41.102
It's not random.
He's from the upper east side.

17:41.104 --> 17:43.604
And he invited me
to his parents' place

17:43.606 --> 17:46.340
- For shabbat on Friday night.
- We never do the east side.

17:46.342 --> 17:48.375
Whoa, since when?

17:48.377 --> 17:50.443
And you're not even jewish.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.044
No.

17:52.046 --> 17:53.645
But I could be.

17:53.647 --> 17:55.680
We're 21st-century new yorkers.

17:55.682 --> 17:58.449
We don't believe in god.
We don't believe in anything.

17:58.451 --> 18:01.985
Whoa, I don't
not believe in anything.

18:01.987 --> 18:05.521
I believe in the no-kiss list

18:05.523 --> 18:06.588
And coconut cupcakes.

18:11.061 --> 18:12.527
And I believe in you.

18:18.034 --> 18:19.333
Snuggle me.

18:25.007 --> 18:28.641
Since when do you actually
go around kissing boys?

18:31.479 --> 18:34.579
Since there's actually some
super cute boys for me to kiss.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.549
But in high school,
you never even--

18:38.551 --> 18:42.119
High school, shmigh school.
Yuck.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.621
Okay. In high school,

18:43.623 --> 18:47.524
My sexuality
was purely hypothetical.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.292
College gay's different.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.161
Now, I can, like...

18:52.163 --> 18:54.630
Actually meet guys.

18:54.632 --> 18:57.199
Lots of guys.

19:00.671 --> 19:03.137
So... Now you're, like...

19:05.341 --> 19:08.909
Totally gay?

19:08.911 --> 19:10.710
I've always been totally gay.

19:15.683 --> 19:17.649
Right.

19:17.651 --> 19:20.885
Of course.
I mean... Obviously.

19:25.891 --> 19:27.490
But nothing has to change,
right?

19:30.761 --> 19:32.694
I mean,
we're still naomi and ely?

19:32.696 --> 19:35.463
Of course
we're still naomi and ely.

19:35.465 --> 19:39.500
Now, we're just naomi
and ely plus boys.

19:39.502 --> 19:41.335
Hmm?

19:44.773 --> 19:46.339
Beddy-bye time.

19:55.449 --> 19:57.916
Naomi:
<i> I lie to everyone.</i>

19:57.918 --> 20:00.451
<i> But mostly...</i>

20:00.453 --> 20:02.553
<i> I think I lie to myself.</i>

20:05.925 --> 20:09.293
¶

20:13.832 --> 20:17.533
Closer. Closer.
And say "carrie".

20:17.535 --> 20:20.302
- Both: Carrie.
- Thanks.

20:20.304 --> 20:23.305
So tell me, are you gonna
do it with bruce 2?

20:23.307 --> 20:24.839
Yet to be determined.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.574
You've been dating for,
like, a month

20:26.576 --> 20:28.909
Which translates to, like,
a year in college time,

20:28.911 --> 20:31.478
And you're still doing things
that end with "alking"

20:31.480 --> 20:34.247
Instead of things
that end in "ucking."

20:34.249 --> 20:36.315
( chuckles )

20:36.317 --> 20:38.417
What are you waiting for?

20:38.419 --> 20:40.452
I don't know.

20:40.454 --> 20:43.254
If I get chocolate,
would you go coconut?

20:43.256 --> 20:45.789
- Mmm, I want it all.
- ( snarls )

20:45.791 --> 20:47.757
But here's a thing--
he's, "a,"

20:47.759 --> 20:49.992
- Kind of obsessed with me.
- Right.

20:49.994 --> 20:51.860
- "b," canadian.
- Yes.

20:51.862 --> 20:54.495
And "c," a bruce,
which is just kind of --

20:54.497 --> 20:56.797
- Redundant.
- I was thinking more vanilla.

20:56.799 --> 20:59.800
- Mm-hmm. Oh, my god.
- Ooh, speaking of.

20:59.802 --> 21:01.635
- But...
- Yeah?

21:01.637 --> 21:03.770
He tells me I'm his muse,
which is interesting, no?

21:03.772 --> 21:07.306
Ooh. That's nice.
That's nice.

21:07.308 --> 21:11.510
Anyways, I told him to pick me
up at the building tonight.

21:11.512 --> 21:14.012
So you, like,
actually like him?

21:14.014 --> 21:17.582
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe I do.

21:17.584 --> 21:19.850
And like you said,
we're in college anyway.

21:19.852 --> 21:24.420
So, I mean, there's no reason
we shouldn't do it.

21:24.422 --> 21:26.021
Right?

21:26.023 --> 21:27.288
Well,
what do you think?

21:33.362 --> 21:35.495
Would you kill me if
I'm too strung out for sugar?

21:39.634 --> 21:41.400
Read my mind much?

21:41.402 --> 21:43.335
Home?

21:43.337 --> 21:45.370
Yeah, home.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.604
Awesome.

21:57.815 --> 22:00.549

22:08.692 --> 22:10.758
Can I help you?

22:10.760 --> 22:12.693
Yeah.
( clears throat )

22:12.695 --> 22:14.928
I'm here to pick up naomi?

22:14.930 --> 22:16.496
<i> ( elevator dings )</i>

22:16.498 --> 22:18.965
You must be bruce 2.

22:18.967 --> 22:22.635
¶ o, canada ¶

22:22.637 --> 22:26.305
That's you, big guy.
Naomi will be right down.

22:26.307 --> 22:29.474
She is just bleaching
her lady beard.

22:29.476 --> 22:31.375
Girl was looking
borderline frida kahlo.

22:31.377 --> 22:32.976
So not pretty.

22:35.080 --> 22:36.813
I like that.
It's nice.

22:40.585 --> 22:42.351
<i> ( elevator dings )</i>

22:44.988 --> 22:47.321
Hello, everyone.
How are we doing?

22:47.323 --> 22:50.624
Bruce 1,
meet bruce 2.

22:50.626 --> 22:53.460
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:00.735 --> 23:03.335
So what are we all doing here?

23:03.337 --> 23:05.470
-<i> ( elevator dings ) </i>
- we're waiting for naomi.

23:05.472 --> 23:09.574
- What about naomi?
- ( wolf whistles )

23:09.576 --> 23:10.975
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:15.781 --> 23:17.981
So, uh, you set?

23:17.983 --> 23:20.650
- Yeppers.
- Let's fly.

23:24.622 --> 23:26.655
He's... Coming, too.

23:31.895 --> 23:35.062
Okay, I know, I know, I know,
I shouldn't love a girl

23:35.064 --> 23:36.830
Who toys so carelessly
with other people's emotions,

23:36.832 --> 23:38.498
Especially mine,
but it's not like my brain

23:38.500 --> 23:40.032
Has the ability
to overrule my heart.

23:40.034 --> 23:41.900
And other parts
of your anatomy.

23:41.902 --> 23:43.835
Oh, my god, george,
that's so funny.

23:43.837 --> 23:45.736
That's so funny.
You're such a good comedian.

23:45.738 --> 23:49.139
You're making a penis joke.
Is that you're closer now?

23:49.141 --> 23:51.908
God, we're talking
about real things here.

23:51.910 --> 23:53.943
Adult feelings.
You wouldn't understand, george.

23:53.945 --> 23:56.645
Okay, the perfect bill murray
binge-watching weekend

23:56.647 --> 23:59.414
Has gotta be "ghostbusters,"
"groundhog day," "rushmore,"

23:59.416 --> 24:00.982
"caddyshack,"
"what about bob,"

24:00.984 --> 24:03.451
And to end in tears,
"lost in translation."

24:03.453 --> 24:04.952
- I love it!
- Amazing.

24:04.954 --> 24:07.421
I'm telling you,
I've seen it a million times.

24:07.423 --> 24:10.891
He says, "I'll always remember
these past few days with you."

24:10.893 --> 24:12.626
Okay. Naomi,
let's set this boy straight.

24:12.628 --> 24:14.127
At the end
of "lost in translation,"

Bill murray pulls scar-jo in
and whispers,

But I won't let

Right?
Come on. Right?

24:22.068 --> 24:24.134
There's this film festival
going on up at lincoln center.

24:24.136 --> 24:28.004
-<i> We could go. </i>
- No, ely and I don't go
above 14th street.

You know what,
I have a better idea.

24:29.974 --> 24:32.841

24:56.529 --> 24:59.563
¶ and I turn back
to myself ¶

24:59.565 --> 25:01.665
Whoo!

25:01.667 --> 25:05.201
¶ shag, bi-level,
bob, dorothy hamill do ¶

25:05.203 --> 25:08.037
¶ sausage curl, chicken wing,
it's all because of you ¶

25:08.039 --> 25:09.171
¶ with your blow-dried,
feather-backed ¶

25:09.173 --> 25:11.640
¶ toni home wave too ¶

25:11.642 --> 25:14.576
¶ flip, for, frizz, flop,
it's all because of you ¶

25:14.578 --> 25:17.679
¶ it's all because of you,
it's all because of you ¶

25:17.681 --> 25:19.113
¶ whoo-hoo ¶

25:19.115 --> 25:22.015
( cheers and applause )

25:22.017 --> 25:23.616
Yeah.

25:25.586 --> 25:27.953
Thank you. Oh!

25:27.955 --> 25:30.155
- Ely:<i> Yeah! That was amazing! </i>
-<i> ( naomi squeals )</i>

25:30.157 --> 25:31.990
Oh, my god,
you were amazing.

25:31.992 --> 25:35.226
I loved that one part
when you were doing the thing.

25:35.228 --> 25:37.027
When you were crawling
across the table.

25:37.029 --> 25:39.029
- Did you like that?
- So sexy.

25:39.031 --> 25:40.797
There's your little buddy?

25:40.799 --> 25:43.232
Oh, my god, I know you.
Can I get your autographs?

25:43.234 --> 25:45.000
( laughs ) no.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.601
That was insane.

25:46.603 --> 25:48.502
( sighs ) I'm beat.

25:48.504 --> 25:50.637
Ely, homeward bound,
darling.

25:50.639 --> 25:53.072
Oh, daddy is hoping
for a hot hook-up

25:53.074 --> 25:56.008
Somewhere
in this big bad city.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.010
Hold up.
Are you ditching me?

25:58.012 --> 26:01.813
Uh, girl, I thought you two
were gonna bump the uglies.

26:05.051 --> 26:07.684
Oh, right, we are.

26:07.686 --> 26:10.853
We so are.

26:10.855 --> 26:14.223
Um, hey, you know,
you could, like,

26:14.225 --> 26:17.859
Definitely come back
to dorm room if you wanted.

26:17.861 --> 26:20.628
Be good, you two.

26:20.630 --> 26:24.264
But not too good, huh?
Get some.

26:24.266 --> 26:25.965
-<i> Bye! </i>
- Bye!

26:41.716 --> 26:43.615
Yeah.

26:43.617 --> 26:46.517
Woman:<i> ¶ something's</i>
<i> happening to me, ooh ¶</i>

26:46.519 --> 26:48.051
<i>¶ something's happening to me ¶</i>

26:48.053 --> 26:49.819
<i> ¶ I feel myself changing ¶</i>

26:55.059 --> 26:57.059
-<i> ¶ face it ¶ </i>
- nice robe.

26:57.061 --> 26:58.827
<i> ¶ what I want,</i>
<i> what I want ¶</i>

26:58.829 --> 27:00.562
<i> ¶ what I want, what I want,</i>
<i> yeah... ¶</i>

27:00.564 --> 27:02.529
<i> ( song continues on stereo )</i>

27:06.034 --> 27:08.000
<i>( couple moaning through wall )</i>

27:12.172 --> 27:14.005
( chuckles )

27:19.078 --> 27:22.913
Do you maybe wanna, like--
I don't know, take your top off?

27:22.915 --> 27:24.948
Um...

27:27.085 --> 27:28.818
Do you want me to?

27:28.820 --> 27:30.753
Um, if you want to?

27:32.857 --> 27:34.990
- Okay. Sure.
-<i> All right.</i>

27:44.801 --> 27:46.933
Ooh. Victory.

27:50.204 --> 27:52.070
Wow. Um...

27:59.945 --> 28:01.945
Is-- is that from choice?

28:05.083 --> 28:06.415
( chuckles )

28:18.929 --> 28:21.396
You gotta see this video
of these ferrets on youtube--

28:21.398 --> 28:22.897
Oh, shit.

28:22.899 --> 28:25.833
Apologies. Proceed.

28:31.707 --> 28:33.273
- You wanna watch a movie?
- Yeah.

28:33.275 --> 28:34.807
Cool.

28:52.293 --> 28:53.425
Naomi.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.860
Oh! Oh, monkeys.

28:55.862 --> 28:57.761
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

28:57.763 --> 29:00.830
This is embarrassing.
Thank you. Tampon.

29:07.805 --> 29:09.504
So, what, your college bruce

29:09.506 --> 29:11.305
Couldn't you help you
carry these?

29:13.909 --> 29:17.110
Gina.
Is that your girlfriend?

29:17.112 --> 29:19.479
She must be really pretty.
Obviously, she's pretty--

29:19.481 --> 29:23.115
Gina was my mother's name.

29:23.117 --> 29:25.884
Was?

29:25.886 --> 29:28.786
I took this gig
when she got sick.

29:28.788 --> 29:31.822
I had to work nights
so I could take care her

29:31.824 --> 29:33.256
When my dad was working.

29:37.395 --> 29:38.927
Package for...

29:38.929 --> 29:40.295
Thank you.

29:40.297 --> 29:42.797
Just a little clumsy today
I guess.

29:45.802 --> 29:47.535
Thanks, yeah,
I'll sign for that.

29:50.406 --> 29:55.776
Ugh.
Bills, bills, boring bills.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.922
What is this?

30:09.924 --> 30:11.089
I have no idea.

30:11.091 --> 30:12.824
I've never seen
anything like it.

30:14.794 --> 30:16.493
Curious george,
did you happened to see

30:16.495 --> 30:19.262
Who put this archaic contraption
in here?

30:24.368 --> 30:27.235
- ( screaming and grunting )
- naomi:<i> Mom?</i>

30:27.237 --> 30:31.239
Mom? Mom!

30:31.241 --> 30:33.040
Mom!
Have you gone non-linear?!

30:33.042 --> 30:35.409
- What are you doing?
- Oh, hi, honey.

30:35.411 --> 30:38.145
What the hell are you doing
with a freaking sledgehammer?

30:38.147 --> 30:39.546
The closet wall--

30:39.548 --> 30:41.581
Well,
he had his and her closets,

30:41.583 --> 30:43.883
- And there's no need
for two anymore.
- Holy shit.

30:43.885 --> 30:47.820
- And that's why I thought
I'd make one giant open space.
- Shit.

30:47.822 --> 30:51.390
I've thinking of pursuing
interior design.

30:51.392 --> 30:53.492
Maybe you should stick
to jewelry.

30:53.494 --> 30:56.928
K. Flay:<i> ¶ little did I know she</i>
<i> would get so crazy so fast ¶</i>

30:56.930 --> 30:59.263
<i> ¶ so maybe I'll get baked</i>
<i> on the daily ¶</i>

31:12.309 --> 31:13.341
( sighs )

31:13.343 --> 31:16.377

31:16.379 --> 31:18.212
<i> ¶ 'cause</i>
<i> it's all downhill... ¶</i>

31:18.214 --> 31:20.414
Hell will freeze over before
we come up with the money

31:20.416 --> 31:22.082
To pay for that wall.

31:22.084 --> 31:26.019
If you need help, I can be
a kind of a... Handyman.

31:26.021 --> 31:27.987
<i> ¶ my folks split up,</i>

31:27.989 --> 31:29.621

31:41.933 --> 31:46.168
Ely, I hate you.
Pick up your phone.

<i> ¶ think I'll stay in bed ¶</i>

31:47.337 --> 31:49.136

I'm here with ely.

31:53.508 --> 31:55.941
Yeah? You and everybody else.

31:57.911 --> 32:00.444
- Really?
- Really.

Not bad.

<i> ( rock music playing )</i>

32:53.189 --> 32:54.988
Ely!

32:54.990 --> 32:57.223
Oh, my god.
Naomi, you're here.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.024
You are the hottest.

32:59.026 --> 33:01.326
Way to go awol on me.

33:01.328 --> 33:03.127
I'm so sorry.

33:03.129 --> 33:05.262
<i> You know I'm always ready</i>
<i> to dance with you.</i>

33:05.264 --> 33:08.064
Come here.
Come on.

33:08.066 --> 33:11.366
Oh, yeah, girl.
You got it.

33:15.038 --> 33:17.438
By the way,
thanks for the retro tape.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.006
What?

33:19.008 --> 33:22.376
The cassette in my mailbox?

33:22.378 --> 33:26.012
( laughs ) where would I
even get a cassette?

33:26.014 --> 33:27.947
If not you, then who?

33:27.949 --> 33:30.516
Bruce 2? Ooh.

33:30.518 --> 33:33.185
Hey, there.
Hey, excuse me.

33:33.187 --> 33:36.254
¶

34:08.020 --> 34:10.020
My night was a total bust.

34:10.022 --> 34:12.622
You know, it's one thing
to pull that ely crap

34:12.624 --> 34:15.424
With someone else,
but with me, seriously?

34:15.426 --> 34:19.161
No, he crossed the line.
( sighs )

34:19.163 --> 34:21.696
You know what I think?
He's just jealous.

34:21.698 --> 34:23.097
Of what?

34:23.099 --> 34:25.466
Of us.
Not that he should be.

34:29.672 --> 34:31.405
- Hey.
- ( groans )

34:31.407 --> 34:33.774
Hey, are you okay?

34:33.776 --> 34:35.642
Yeah.

34:38.513 --> 34:40.012
God, you're beautiful.

34:53.060 --> 34:55.760
Hey, do you think I could crash
here this weekend?

34:55.762 --> 34:57.762
I just definitely don't think
I can deal

34:57.764 --> 34:59.363
With going back
to the building.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.698
- Mmm.
- Please?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.633
Only 'cause you're
so damn cute.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.501
( laughs )

35:11.742 --> 35:14.709
So rumor has it
that you spent the weekend

35:14.711 --> 35:16.744
Shacked up at bruce's.

35:16.746 --> 35:18.579
Things, like,
heating up with you guys?

35:18.581 --> 35:20.447
You kidding me?

35:20.449 --> 35:25.185
We barely made it to second
base, which is fine by me.

35:25.187 --> 35:27.720
Oh, yes, just the robin
I was looking for.

35:27.722 --> 35:30.055
Robin, my name twin.

35:30.057 --> 35:31.823
This place is like a total maze,

35:31.825 --> 35:34.158
And I got this philosophy paper
due mañana.

35:34.160 --> 35:37.194
Well, it's organized
alphabetically by subject.

35:37.196 --> 35:39.596
Hey, robin, maybe since you--
you know,

35:39.598 --> 35:41.497
You work in the library,
you could--

35:41.499 --> 35:44.299
You could robin out
with his research.

35:44.301 --> 35:46.567
Oh, right.

35:46.569 --> 35:51.671
Robin, um, would you, like,
want me to help you?

35:51.673 --> 35:54.473
Uh, yeah.

35:54.475 --> 35:57.709
That would be sweet.
Yeah, major gratitude.

35:57.711 --> 36:00.678
Um, so hit me up
when you get off?

36:00.680 --> 36:02.780
- Okay.
- All right, yeah.

36:02.782 --> 36:05.215
Get you ladies
on the flippity-floppy.

36:05.217 --> 36:08.418
Later, brah.

36:08.420 --> 36:09.652
Dude!

36:09.654 --> 36:11.086
( laughs )

36:11.088 --> 36:15.522
He-robin definitely wants you.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.624
- He does?
- Sure.

36:17.626 --> 36:21.561
He just doesn't know it yet.
First thing's first.

36:21.563 --> 36:24.597
Just because
you work in a library

36:24.599 --> 36:28.200
Does not mean that you have to
dress like a librarian.

36:28.202 --> 36:30.702
When you make plans to help him,
you gotta say something like,

36:30.704 --> 36:33.304
"it's a date,"
and then when you're together,

36:33.306 --> 36:35.673
You gotta make
some physical contact.

36:35.675 --> 36:38.242
- ( clicks tongue )
- physical contact?

36:40.246 --> 36:41.778
Like where?

36:45.416 --> 36:47.349
This is fun.

36:47.351 --> 36:49.617
Okay.
Work study is far from fun.

36:49.619 --> 36:52.519
No, I mean,
like, you and me

36:52.521 --> 36:55.221
Doing girl talk, you know?

36:55.223 --> 36:56.422
Never done it.

37:00.127 --> 37:02.627
<i> All my life,</i>
<i> it's been all ely.</i>

37:02.629 --> 37:04.462
I mean throw in a bruce
or two, but..

37:04.464 --> 37:07.264
The girl quotient's
always been zero.

37:07.266 --> 37:09.332
Well, I'm really glad
to be of service.

37:09.334 --> 37:11.200
Robyn, what's sex like?

37:11.202 --> 37:12.467
What?

37:12.469 --> 37:14.702
You're a virgin?

37:14.704 --> 37:15.903
No way.

37:15.905 --> 37:17.704
Shh!

37:17.706 --> 37:19.405
This is a library.

37:21.509 --> 37:22.841
What about bruce 2?

37:22.843 --> 37:25.543
I don't know, is...

37:26.746 --> 37:28.712
Bruce really the one?

37:28.714 --> 37:33.450
Well, he doesn't have to be
the one to be the first one.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.690
Do you know how much easier
my life would be

37:40.692 --> 37:43.893
If ely noticed my looks
in the "wow,

37:43.895 --> 37:48.031
Naomi's boner hot," way
and not in the,

37:48.033 --> 37:51.267
"those stilettos I picked out
for naomi are great," way?

37:51.269 --> 37:54.603
Ely is gay.

37:54.605 --> 37:56.604
And that's never gonna change.

37:59.275 --> 38:00.507
I know.

38:10.751 --> 38:11.983
Hey, naomi.

38:11.985 --> 38:14.585
Stranger,
what are you doing here?

38:14.587 --> 38:16.320
Bug, where have you been
all my life?

38:16.322 --> 38:17.988
Where have I been?
Where have<i> you</i> been?

38:17.990 --> 38:19.789
We'll catch up.
Magnolia?

38:19.791 --> 38:22.558
Can't, I have to meet
with my advisor.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.860
Worst, but back
at the building later?

38:24.862 --> 38:26.595
- Are you there?
- Oh, I can't.

38:26.597 --> 38:27.963
La paella
with my spanish club.

38:27.965 --> 38:30.665
Since when do we join things?

38:30.667 --> 38:34.435
- Since now, I guess?
- ( cell phone rings )

38:34.437 --> 38:36.437
So suddenly college means
we don't see each other?

38:36.439 --> 38:38.839
Sorry. I gotta catch this.
Hey, yeah,

38:38.841 --> 38:40.974
No, I'll be there in a sec.
I gotta go.

38:40.976 --> 38:42.942
- See you never?
- I love you.

38:42.944 --> 38:44.677
Meeya more.

38:44.679 --> 38:46.945
<i> Don't forget.</i>
<i> Halloween shopping.</i>

38:46.947 --> 38:50.448
Hey, yeah, so I'm on my way
right... Now.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.887
<i> ( ian britt's</i>

39:09.100 --> 39:12.601

39:39.523 --> 39:41.723
- We rolling?
- Yeah.

39:41.725 --> 39:43.958
Action.

39:43.960 --> 39:47.361
Just know, I watched five men
trip over themselves

39:47.363 --> 39:49.363
Checking you out

39:49.365 --> 39:51.798
While you merely
glared at them.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.933
Your beauty,

39:53.935 --> 39:56.902
Do you use it for good
or evil?

39:59.706 --> 40:00.871
Evil.

40:04.409 --> 40:06.842
But don't worry,
you're safe.

40:08.912 --> 40:10.478
People make the mistake

40:10.480 --> 40:12.779
Of letting beauty guide
attraction.

40:15.884 --> 40:18.651
My father fell for my mother
the first time he saw her.

40:20.821 --> 40:24.022
But he eventually tossed aside
the beauty myth

40:24.024 --> 40:26.391
For the very real lesbian
across the hall.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.830
Then the lesbian remembered
she was lesbian.

40:36.068 --> 40:40.437
So dad left, and...

40:40.439 --> 40:43.106
Mom decided to hide her beauty
underneath the bedcovers.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.643
No shit.

40:48.645 --> 40:51.445
No shit.

40:51.447 --> 40:56.082

41:05.459 --> 41:06.925
-<i> Leave a message. </i>
-<i> ( beep )</i>

41:06.927 --> 41:09.928
I cannot be the guy
who leaves three voicemails.

41:14.834 --> 41:19.069
Let me guess, naomi's
either late or she forgot.

41:19.071 --> 41:21.104
Can I offer you a drink?

41:21.106 --> 41:24.807
Um, no, I'm all right.

41:24.809 --> 41:27.976
Good, I hear brandy
can get you into trouble.

41:27.978 --> 41:29.510
Who's brandy?

41:29.512 --> 41:31.512
My mother's brandy.

41:31.514 --> 41:34.147
I didn't think you had
a mom named brandy?

41:34.149 --> 41:37.550
<i> I don't.</i>
<i> She's more jennie.</i>

41:37.552 --> 41:40.753
( laughs ) I'm sorry,
you don't get that joke.

41:40.755 --> 41:43.989
- That's weird, oh, my god.
- I guess.

41:43.991 --> 41:47.025
Wait, do you keep your porn
in mint condition?

41:47.027 --> 41:49.227
¶ busted ¶

41:49.229 --> 41:52.129
But it's a bit more
embarrassing than that.

41:55.968 --> 41:57.968
Oh, x-men?

41:57.970 --> 42:00.603
Yeah, I know I should have
gotten rid of those,

42:00.605 --> 42:02.905
- Like, a long time ago.
- Are you kidding me?

42:02.907 --> 42:04.473
Can I open it?

42:04.475 --> 42:06.741
Yeah, go ahead.
That's cool.

42:06.743 --> 42:09.577
Man, the x-men were, like,
pivotal heroes for me.

42:09.579 --> 42:12.980
The other superheroes, they have
their normal alter egos,

42:12.982 --> 42:15.048
You know, the clark kents
and the bruce waynes

42:15.050 --> 42:16.182
- To hide behind.
- Yeah.

42:16.184 --> 42:17.850
X-men are different.

42:17.852 --> 42:20.686
They're always exactly
who they are.

42:20.688 --> 42:24.489
Yeah, I mean, like,
wolverine can't shave,

42:24.491 --> 42:26.257
Put on a tie and then go to work
at a newspaper the next day.

42:26.259 --> 42:30.527
Yeah, exactly, cyclops
can't take off a cape

42:30.529 --> 42:32.729
And attend
fancy dinner parties.

42:32.731 --> 42:35.164
These mutants
are full-time mutants.

42:35.166 --> 42:38.033
Yeah,
their powers and weaknesses

42:38.035 --> 42:42.070
- Are all out in the open.
- Yeah.

42:42.072 --> 42:46.807
Are you a mutant?
( chuckles )

42:46.809 --> 42:48.809
I can roll my tongue.

42:48.811 --> 42:50.911
Oh, yeah.
( german accent ) that's good.

42:50.913 --> 42:52.078
Thank you.

42:52.080 --> 42:55.548
I have a microscopic
third nipple.

42:55.550 --> 42:58.183
- Oh, where is this we must--
- no!

42:58.185 --> 43:00.084
- Jeez.
- ( both laugh )

43:01.587 --> 43:03.086
I like you.

43:04.856 --> 43:07.756
Don't sound so surprised.

43:07.758 --> 43:11.659
God, I can't even imagine
what you must think of me.

43:11.661 --> 43:13.227
Terror.

43:13.229 --> 43:15.696
Naomi has told me
a lot of stories.

43:15.698 --> 43:16.963
I bet.

43:16.965 --> 43:19.065
- But...
- Oh, man.

43:19.067 --> 43:21.867
I like you better in person.

43:21.869 --> 43:23.935
It's funny.

43:23.937 --> 43:26.170
I think I've always liked
naomi's version of me best.

43:28.140 --> 43:29.772
Maybe you're mistaken.

43:41.952 --> 43:45.253
I shouldn't have done that.
Nope, nope. Okay.

43:45.255 --> 43:48.756
Sorry, no, no, no, no, no,
I should not have done that.

43:48.758 --> 43:49.957
<i> Um...</i>

43:53.262 --> 43:56.196
I mean, I really
shouldn't have done that.

43:56.198 --> 43:58.130
You shouldn't have.

44:01.635 --> 44:02.867
I wanted to.

44:06.105 --> 44:07.304
I did, too.

44:16.014 --> 44:19.715
So, call me carmen san diego,
but I'm beginning to think

44:19.717 --> 44:24.719
That b2 is not the man
behind my mystery mix.

44:24.721 --> 44:26.120
Why?
What do you mean?

44:26.122 --> 44:28.055
Well, I finally got my hands
on a tape player.

44:28.057 --> 44:30.257
Pervy mr. Mcallister
has one of course

44:30.259 --> 44:32.692
Because he's still living
in a different century.

44:32.694 --> 44:37.096
And it turns out my music man's
taste in tunes is pretty epic.

44:37.098 --> 44:39.164
And I can only hope
it's not bruce 1,

44:39.166 --> 44:41.632
Which leaves only one
dark course in the running.

44:43.936 --> 44:45.001
Who?

44:46.838 --> 44:49.238
¶ gabriel ¶

44:49.240 --> 44:51.940
He has access,
and he's in a band.

44:51.942 --> 44:53.675
So he knows good music.

44:53.677 --> 44:55.209
Naomi do you really think
you should be getting

44:55.211 --> 44:58.278
This excited over a guy,
gabriel?

44:58.280 --> 45:00.113
What about bruce 2?

45:00.115 --> 45:02.181
What's with you today?

45:02.183 --> 45:04.383
( clears throat )
nothing. I'm good.

45:04.385 --> 45:06.284
Are we still set
on sid and nancy?

45:06.286 --> 45:08.619
Oh, so set.
I love us on Halloween.

45:08.621 --> 45:10.754
You'll look for me,
I'll look for you?

45:10.756 --> 45:12.055
- Done.
- Awesome.

45:16.194 --> 45:17.960
( gasps ) ooh.

45:22.632 --> 45:23.998
Hey, you.

45:25.901 --> 45:27.800
Yeah, looks great.
Try it on.

45:27.802 --> 45:31.870
Are you snacking on stupid?
I was obviously joking.

45:31.872 --> 45:34.939
Since when do we endorse
camel toe?

45:34.941 --> 45:38.108
Ely what is wrong with you?

45:38.110 --> 45:40.643
I have to tell you something.

45:42.747 --> 45:45.380
- Are you moving
out of the building?
- No, no, I--

45:47.784 --> 45:50.117
I kissed bruce 2.

45:50.119 --> 45:52.185
Yeah.

45:52.187 --> 45:54.020
I'm sure, whatever.

45:54.022 --> 45:56.889
No, I mean, like,
I really did kiss him.

45:56.891 --> 45:58.790
( clears throat )

46:00.827 --> 46:03.160
Well, I hope you enjoyed it
more than I do.

46:03.162 --> 46:06.096
Just thinking...
You know,

46:06.098 --> 46:08.364
You never put him
on the no-kiss list.

46:08.366 --> 46:10.432
- So it was--
- yeah, well, I didn't put
your grandma gertie

46:10.434 --> 46:12.134
On the list either.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.402
Some things are just obvious.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.904
And bruce 2 is not exactly
your type.

46:19.808 --> 46:21.974
Yeah, you're right.
Look it was stupid,

46:21.976 --> 46:24.309
<i> It was-- we were just</i>
<i> in the moment and like--</i>

46:24.311 --> 46:26.010
Ely.

46:26.012 --> 46:27.911
This is amazing.

46:27.913 --> 46:30.813
<i> Prepare to be jealous,</i>
<i> people.</i>

46:30.815 --> 46:32.481
How much for this one?

46:32.483 --> 46:35.016
<i> ( rock music playing )</i>

46:45.127 --> 46:47.393
<i> ( knock on door )</i>

46:47.395 --> 46:49.962
Oh, my god.

46:49.964 --> 46:51.830
Naomi, you picked today
of all days

46:51.832 --> 46:53.531
To be only eight minutes late.

46:56.435 --> 46:58.368
Trick or treat.

46:58.370 --> 47:00.303
I was in the neighborhood.

47:00.305 --> 47:02.004
No, you weren't.

47:02.006 --> 47:03.939
I'm glad you weren't.
Come in.

47:07.911 --> 47:10.978
- I'm-- I'm sorry.
- For?

47:10.980 --> 47:15.282
For coming here so late.
For wanting to see you.

47:15.284 --> 47:17.984
- It's okay.
-<i> ( knock on door )</i>

47:17.986 --> 47:19.585
Naomi:
<i> Ely!</i>

47:19.587 --> 47:21.853
Get in the room.
Go, go, go, go!

47:21.855 --> 47:23.254
This is the first place
she's gonna look.

47:23.256 --> 47:26.824
Uh... Get in the closet.
I'm sorry.

47:26.826 --> 47:29.159
<i> ( knocking on door )</i>

47:29.161 --> 47:30.994
Naomi:
<i> Ely!</i>

47:30.996 --> 47:32.829
This door doesn't close.

47:32.831 --> 47:34.430
Just go to the back and put
something over your face.

47:36.233 --> 47:37.398
<i> Ely!</i>

47:41.337 --> 47:42.502
Ely!

47:42.504 --> 47:44.937
Chill, naomi.

47:44.939 --> 47:46.872
Where the fuck were you?

47:46.874 --> 47:49.975
That belt...

47:49.977 --> 47:51.543
Is offensive on you.

47:51.545 --> 47:54.212
No, no. You're just saying that
because you wanna wear it.

47:54.214 --> 47:56.414
But your outfit's way better
than mine, come on.

47:56.416 --> 47:59.250
Face it, ely, tonight,

47:59.252 --> 48:01.385
That baby's calling
this waist mama.

48:01.387 --> 48:04.287
We share everything, right?

48:08.526 --> 48:11.293
Are you at least ready to go?

48:11.295 --> 48:13.428
<i> Do you mind if bruce</i>
<i> comes up?</i>

48:13.430 --> 48:15.630
He's downstairs.

48:15.632 --> 48:18.432
<i> I ran into him on my way</i>
<i> to the laundry room.</i>

48:20.903 --> 48:23.637
The first, not your cheap-thrill
cheating partner.

48:23.639 --> 48:25.271
All right, naomi,
that's not fair.

48:25.273 --> 48:27.606
Wait a sec.

48:27.608 --> 48:32.577
You make out with my boyfriend,
and I'm not being fair?

48:32.579 --> 48:35.379
You know what, I don't know
what I'm talking about, okay?

48:35.381 --> 48:37.381
Let's just go.

48:37.383 --> 48:39.383
All right.
I guess you're right.

48:39.385 --> 48:41.251
Let's motor.

48:47.091 --> 48:48.390
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Got it!

48:48.392 --> 48:50.258
Shit! You know what?
I forgot something.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.093
- What did you forget?
- My dick.

48:52.095 --> 48:54.061
You can't possibly expect me
to go anywhere

48:54.063 --> 48:56.229
Without my dick,
right, naomi?

48:56.231 --> 48:57.930
Two secs,
meet me in the lobby?

48:57.932 --> 48:59.665
No, not in the lobby.
I'll wait here.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.099
Okay.

49:08.107 --> 49:11.041
Please stay.
I want you to stay.

49:11.043 --> 49:12.409
I don't--

49:12.411 --> 49:16.079
This isn't some cheap thrill,
and it's--

49:16.081 --> 49:18.414
I'm definitely not
screwing with your mind.

49:18.416 --> 49:20.649
I don't know what this is.

49:20.651 --> 49:23.418
But it's not that.

49:23.420 --> 49:25.520
I'll be back soon okay?

49:27.423 --> 49:30.624
Wait, um... Gum.

49:30.626 --> 49:33.526
Say you forgot gum.

49:33.528 --> 49:35.661
( chuckles softly )
thanks.

49:35.663 --> 49:37.262
Yeah.

49:37.264 --> 49:40.064
- Hey.
- Got your dick?

49:40.066 --> 49:41.498
Got<i> your</i> dick, naomi?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.933
If I did, would it get me
anywhere with you?

49:46.437 --> 49:47.669
Gum.

49:51.174 --> 49:52.640
Naomi:
<i> Hold up.</i>

49:52.642 --> 49:54.975
<i> Bruce 2,</i>
<i> the prodigal son of dentists,</i>

49:54.977 --> 49:57.377
<i> Only chews sugar-free gum.</i>

49:57.379 --> 50:00.246
<i> Bruce 2</i>
<i> is an orbit man,</i>

50:00.248 --> 50:03.249
<i> But ely is bubble yum's bitch.</i>

50:04.619 --> 50:06.585
Since when do you chew orbit?

50:06.587 --> 50:09.721
Since gaga replaced madonna.
Why do you care?

50:14.594 --> 50:17.094
Why did you really go back
to the apartment?

50:17.096 --> 50:18.695
Told you, helen keller.

50:18.697 --> 50:22.165
G-u-m.

50:22.167 --> 50:23.266
Gum.

50:37.214 --> 50:39.047
Wait.

50:39.049 --> 50:42.283
Are you sure you didn't leave
anything else upstairs?

50:42.285 --> 50:44.385
Like what?

50:44.387 --> 50:48.288
Like your balls
to go along with your dick.

50:48.290 --> 50:50.456
Language, gene harlow.

50:56.730 --> 50:59.097
Buy your own damn drinks
tonight, ely.

50:59.099 --> 51:01.566
It's time for a changing
of the guard.

51:01.568 --> 51:04.168
Come on, bruce, let's take
cutie patootie for a walk.

51:04.170 --> 51:05.736
Are we going out tonight
or what?

51:05.738 --> 51:08.271
Have fun with whatever it is
you're lying to me about.

51:08.273 --> 51:10.106
Because I've changed
my mind, ely,

51:10.108 --> 51:12.608
I don't wanna go to a stupid
nyu party with you tonight.

51:12.610 --> 51:14.643
Is this about bruce?

51:14.645 --> 51:17.679
- What's about me?
- Not you, the other bruce.

51:17.681 --> 51:20.481
- Oh, is he coming with us, too?
- Why don't you ask ely?

51:20.483 --> 51:24.485
I just thought he was with you
when he went upstairs earlier.

51:29.124 --> 51:32.291
Looks like colonel bastard's
upstairs in ely's bedroom

51:32.293 --> 51:34.059
With a candlestick.

51:34.061 --> 51:38.063
Listen, I was always
gonna go with you okay?

51:38.065 --> 51:39.631
<i> You are my top priority.</i>

51:39.633 --> 51:42.367
( laughs ) oh.
That's brilliant, ely.

51:42.369 --> 51:45.103
I am so flattered to know
that you put my needs

51:45.105 --> 51:47.171
Over the needs
of my boyfriend!

51:47.173 --> 51:49.506
Well, I think it's safe to say
he's not your boyfriend anymore.

51:51.276 --> 51:53.276
No, let go of me!

51:53.278 --> 51:54.443
Fine.

51:57.548 --> 52:00.749
I like him.
I really do.

52:00.751 --> 52:03.551
Is that why you're hiding him?
Because you like him so much?

52:03.553 --> 52:05.519
Do you really wanna know
why I'm hiding him?

52:06.755 --> 52:08.588
Because I'm afraid of you.

52:08.590 --> 52:12.358
Let's just take a chill pill.
Let's breathe in--

52:12.360 --> 52:13.726
Both:
<i> Shut up, george!</i>

52:13.728 --> 52:15.327
I need your jacket.

52:15.329 --> 52:16.428
Go.

52:18.665 --> 52:22.099
Come on, bruce, I wanna dance
with somebody who loves me.

52:22.101 --> 52:23.767
- Cutie patootie!
- It's cutie pie--

52:23.769 --> 52:25.235
Shut up.

52:25.237 --> 52:27.237
Have fun!

52:36.280 --> 52:38.346
Hey, uh, naomi?

52:38.348 --> 52:40.347
Uh,
I think I lost cutie pie.

52:42.818 --> 52:44.517
Wanna play candyland?

52:44.519 --> 52:47.586
Wow, life in the big city.
Whoa, look at that navel.

52:47.588 --> 52:49.554
Well, where's your other half?

52:49.556 --> 52:51.289
Isn't it like some law
that if you're out

52:51.291 --> 52:53.491
In the middle of the night,
the ely appendage is with you?

52:53.493 --> 52:55.326
It's kind of a touchy subject.

52:55.328 --> 52:57.394
A quick recap--
what happened is naomi

52:57.396 --> 53:00.797
And bruce 2 are over,
and now bruce 2 is with ely.

53:00.799 --> 53:02.598
With?

53:02.600 --> 53:04.399
Wait, bruce and ely are --

53:04.401 --> 53:08.136
Yeah, it's pretty crazy,
you know, ely and bruce 2.

53:08.138 --> 53:10.238
She was just too good
for him anyway, though.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.706
Everyone in the building's
been saying that for weeks--

53:11.708 --> 53:14.175
Bruce,
could you just leave us?

53:14.177 --> 53:15.543
I'll call you.

53:15.545 --> 53:17.411
Or you call me
when you're done with--

53:17.413 --> 53:19.746
Yeah, have your girl time.
Just call me.

53:22.650 --> 53:24.382
<i> Whoa, ely and--</i>

53:27.353 --> 53:29.152
I mean, are you okay?

53:32.357 --> 53:34.323
You know, I don't even care
if I was bruce 2's

53:34.325 --> 53:36.525
Gay learning curve,

53:36.527 --> 53:39.294
That we're so indifferent
that we're not even bothering

53:39.296 --> 53:42.263
With an official breakup.

53:42.265 --> 53:45.532
But I do care that my
best friend is the reason.

53:51.672 --> 53:53.772
I know it's
a big bad world out there

53:53.774 --> 53:57.575
With war and injustice
and global warming

53:57.577 --> 54:00.177
And people clubbing baby seals.

54:00.179 --> 54:02.679
I'm sorry.

54:02.681 --> 54:05.481
I care most about
the naomi and ely bubble.

54:16.226 --> 54:19.227
I love him.

54:19.229 --> 54:23.197
Friend or brother or...

54:23.199 --> 54:25.165
Whatever shade of ely.

54:28.937 --> 54:31.604
You must think
I'm so totally pathetic.

54:34.809 --> 54:37.242
I guess I just thought
that...

54:37.244 --> 54:38.643
( chuckles softly )

54:38.645 --> 54:41.946
That someone as beautiful
and confident as you

54:41.948 --> 54:45.749
Would never feel
as crappy as the rest of us.

54:45.751 --> 54:47.317
No offense.

54:47.319 --> 54:49.318
None taken.

54:51.889 --> 54:53.788
- Sorry to disappoint.
- No.

54:56.026 --> 54:57.992
It makes you...

54:57.994 --> 54:59.693
Human.

54:59.695 --> 55:01.694
It's a good thing.

55:04.632 --> 55:07.332
Whoa, naomi.

55:07.334 --> 55:09.367
What's got you
all "girl interrupted"?

55:09.369 --> 55:12.403
Nice costume, robin.

55:12.405 --> 55:14.037
Yeah, thanks.

55:14.039 --> 55:15.872
Same to you, robin.

55:17.876 --> 55:19.041
<i> ( cell phone beeps )</i>

55:23.514 --> 55:26.815
Gabriel's shift just ended.

55:26.817 --> 55:32.753
His band is playing
in the west village in 30.

55:32.755 --> 55:34.688
Let's look him up, robins.

55:34.690 --> 55:37.957
But-- oh, god,
what am I gonna wear?

55:37.959 --> 55:40.693
- This isn't a costume.
- Let's go.

55:40.695 --> 55:43.028
- I feel like a blueberry.
- I love blueberries.

55:43.030 --> 55:44.629
¶ upside down ¶

55:46.666 --> 55:50.367

56:39.844 --> 56:41.877
Are you sure
you don't wanna stay?

56:41.879 --> 56:43.478
I kind of want to meet him.

56:43.480 --> 56:45.112
Not tonight.
Let's just go.

56:45.114 --> 56:48.115
Hey, naomi!
Hey, you came.

56:48.117 --> 56:51.118
Thank you so much.
That's so awesome.

56:51.120 --> 56:54.488
It's last call.
Do you want a drink?

56:54.490 --> 56:57.924
You want to get out of here?
Let me buy you breakfast.

56:59.928 --> 57:02.461
Come on.
Eggs, bacon.

57:02.463 --> 57:04.596
My treat.

57:04.598 --> 57:07.799
I don't really
believe in bacon.

57:07.801 --> 57:09.433
Cereal.

57:09.435 --> 57:12.636
Oh, well,
I'm a mueslix man myself.

57:12.638 --> 57:13.903
- ( chuckles )
- so...

57:16.741 --> 57:19.408
You know, I'm just not
really feeling well.

57:19.410 --> 57:21.610
I think I'm just
gonna go home.

57:21.612 --> 57:22.777
Come on.

57:25.581 --> 57:26.780
See you later.

57:28.517 --> 57:29.849
Hey, gabriel.

57:37.558 --> 57:40.191
Otis:
<i> ¶ let me tell you, baby ¶</i>

57:40.193 --> 57:44.695
<i> ¶ what it is I'm looking for ¶</i>

57:44.697 --> 57:47.464

58:32.703 --> 58:34.836
<i> ( door opens )</i>

58:34.838 --> 58:36.537
Hi.

58:36.539 --> 58:38.939
So gabriel, george,
mr. Mcallister and I

58:38.941 --> 58:41.808
Have all decided that we're
team naomi, obviously.

58:41.810 --> 58:44.811
But we kindly allowed you
to keep mrs. Loi.

58:44.813 --> 58:46.479
- What?
- But not the dog.

58:49.550 --> 58:54.819
Okay, "naomi and ely's
new york custody agreement.

58:54.821 --> 58:56.720
- Oh, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

58:56.722 --> 59:00.690
"thou shall not use
the laundry room on sundays."

59:12.937 --> 59:16.104
<i> "thou shalt avoid</i>
<i> yaffa cafe completely."</i>

59:16.106 --> 59:19.740
<i> Instead try starbucks</i>
<i> on astor place.</i>

59:19.742 --> 59:23.844
Thou shalt not go to magnolia,
ever."

59:30.819 --> 59:32.952
"thou shalt look through
your peephole and make sure

59:32.954 --> 59:35.888
That I am not in a foyer when
you were going to the elevator.

59:35.890 --> 59:37.289
Thou shalt go
and check your mail

59:37.291 --> 59:39.124
If you see me waiting
at the elevator lobby.

59:39.126 --> 59:40.692
Thou shalt go straight
to the elevator

59:40.694 --> 59:42.126
If you see me checking
my mail."

59:42.128 --> 59:44.528
Okay.
You need to leave.

59:44.530 --> 59:46.062
- I'll leave
when you close the door.
- I'm twice your size.

59:46.064 --> 59:48.230
- Leave now.
- Just close the door.

59:48.232 --> 59:50.632
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

59:50.634 --> 59:54.902
Amazing.
Give me your hand.

59:54.904 --> 59:58.038
Okay, so maybe it wasn't phrased
like freaking ten commandments

59:58.040 --> 1:00:00.073
But it was like, "if you see me
going to the elevator,

1:00:00.075 --> 1:00:01.707
Go check your mail.

1:00:01.709 --> 1:00:03.742
If you go check your mail,
go to the elevator."

1:00:03.744 --> 1:00:06.010
- Can I get a pretzel?
- Like it's just--

1:00:06.012 --> 1:00:08.078
I'm sorry,
I'm stuck on incomprehension

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:10.580
And just, I don't understand
how something

1:00:10.582 --> 1:00:12.281
Could last so long
and be so strong

1:00:12.283 --> 1:00:14.650
And just end over nothing,
you know what I mean?

1:00:16.620 --> 1:00:20.021
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
Not nothing, okay?

1:00:20.023 --> 1:00:24.658
That came out entirely wrong.
No more naomi talk, all right?

1:00:24.660 --> 1:00:28.228
Okay? Promise.
Come on.

1:00:28.230 --> 1:00:30.063
And you know that pretzel's
mine, right?

1:00:30.065 --> 1:00:31.564
Oh, really?

1:00:31.566 --> 1:00:35.601
( laughs )
aren't toes funny?

1:00:35.603 --> 1:00:36.902
<i> ( laughs )</i>

1:00:39.773 --> 1:00:42.907
Really, naomi?
I know what you're doing.

1:00:42.909 --> 1:00:47.011
And that skirt
hasn't fit since 2010.

1:00:47.013 --> 1:00:48.679
Hater!

1:00:53.352 --> 1:00:56.953
It's 5:00 am.
Maybe you should go to bed.

1:00:56.955 --> 1:00:59.889
Fighting with ely
is so exhausting.

1:00:59.891 --> 1:01:04.360
It is against the co-op board
rules to nap on the lobby sofa.

1:01:04.362 --> 1:01:07.863
Ugh, co-op board,
shmo-op board.

1:01:07.865 --> 1:01:11.666
Come on, please,
just let me sleep out here.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:13.668
Mmm.

1:01:13.670 --> 1:01:15.836
( chuckles )
what kind of trouble

1:01:15.838 --> 1:01:17.671
Did you get yourself
into last night?

1:01:17.673 --> 1:01:20.206
( sighs )
my backup friend robin and I --

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:22.274
What is that,
backup friend?

1:01:22.276 --> 1:01:27.145
She's in my psych class,
and we got all dressed up

1:01:27.147 --> 1:01:30.715
To try and get into this party
with these awful girls.

1:01:30.717 --> 1:01:33.150
Ugh,
you would have hated them.

1:01:33.152 --> 1:01:36.386
And the rest is kind of...

1:01:36.388 --> 1:01:39.188
Blurry from there.

1:01:39.190 --> 1:01:41.156
Yeah.

1:01:41.158 --> 1:01:42.857
- ( chuckles )
- mm-hmm.

1:01:42.859 --> 1:01:47.628
When is the room
gonna stop spinning?

1:01:47.630 --> 1:01:50.864
( laughs ) you'll feel better
in the morning.

1:01:50.866 --> 1:01:54.133
Actually, no, that's not true.
You're gonna feel worse.

1:01:54.135 --> 1:01:57.002
- What?
- Yeah, you'll feel better
in the afternoon, though.

1:01:57.004 --> 1:02:00.238
- Okay, good.
- Actually, I don't know
that for sure, though.

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.273
You can't even
be honest with me!

1:02:02.275 --> 1:02:04.408
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a doorman.

1:02:04.410 --> 1:02:08.912
Listen, I know you think
all this crap with ely

1:02:08.914 --> 1:02:12.181
Is like the worst thing
that ever happened.

1:02:12.183 --> 1:02:15.016
But there's a lot more out there
for you than you realize.

1:02:17.086 --> 1:02:19.019
If you're ready for it.

1:02:24.759 --> 1:02:28.927
By the way, um,
what was your favorite song?

1:02:30.764 --> 1:02:33.765
The mix tape.
Did you like it?

1:02:35.869 --> 1:02:37.702
That was you.

1:02:37.704 --> 1:02:40.771
Oh, I hoped it was you.

1:02:40.773 --> 1:02:43.840
All right, okay,
get out of here, come on.

1:02:43.842 --> 1:02:45.274
( groans )

1:02:51.848 --> 1:02:53.714
Good night, gabriel.

1:02:53.716 --> 1:02:56.349
- Good night.
- You know what?

1:02:56.351 --> 1:02:59.185
You're not a bad face
to see first thing.

1:03:01.889 --> 1:03:03.755
Good night.

1:03:25.344 --> 1:03:26.776
What are you doing here?

1:03:26.778 --> 1:03:29.278
Checking my mail.

1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:32.781
I told you not to do this.

1:03:32.783 --> 1:03:35.416
No, naomi, see,
you didn't tell me anything.

1:03:35.418 --> 1:03:37.985
Telling requires
actual vocal contact.

1:03:37.987 --> 1:03:41.221
What you did is you wrote a list
and said I shouldn't do this.

1:03:41.223 --> 1:03:43.990
<i> Come on, naomi,</i>
<i> this is so silly.</i>

1:03:43.992 --> 1:03:46.759
Yeah.
It's a shit storm of giggles.

1:03:46.761 --> 1:03:49.328
You know what?
No, look, look, look--

1:03:49.330 --> 1:03:51.730
No,<i> you</i> look!
You blew it!

1:03:51.732 --> 1:03:54.866
You totally blew it!
You had me-- you really had me--

1:03:54.868 --> 1:03:56.934
Buying into this whole
cult of ely you created.

1:03:56.936 --> 1:03:59.303
My god,
stop lying to yourself, naomi.

1:03:59.305 --> 1:04:02.906
You never cared about bruce.
You just like the attention.

1:04:02.908 --> 1:04:07.176
I'll plead guilty if I have to,
but I don't feel guilty.

1:04:07.178 --> 1:04:09.945
That's right, ely,
'cause life's a musical, right?

1:04:09.947 --> 1:04:12.013
You're the star of the show,
the life of the party.

1:04:12.015 --> 1:04:14.248
God forbid you should
actually feel anything

1:04:14.250 --> 1:04:16.284
Or realize that
there are consequences

1:04:16.286 --> 1:04:19.287
To your shittiest actions!

1:04:19.289 --> 1:04:22.156
You know what?
You're exactly like my dad.

1:04:22.158 --> 1:04:23.457
No, naomi.

1:04:23.459 --> 1:04:26.893
I am nothing like your dad.

1:04:26.895 --> 1:04:30.463
I can't help the fact
that you can't handle change.

1:04:30.465 --> 1:04:32.865
It's not always gonna
be the same forever, naomi.

1:04:32.867 --> 1:04:35.234
It's not always
gonna be you and me.

1:04:35.236 --> 1:04:38.337
That doesn't change the way
that I feel about you.

1:04:38.339 --> 1:04:41.006
Please, ely, that is so cheap.

1:04:41.008 --> 1:04:43.875
Grow up, naomi!

1:04:43.877 --> 1:04:45.877
If you can't start
facing reality,

1:04:45.879 --> 1:04:47.879
You might as well crawl into bed
and pull the covers up tight

1:04:47.881 --> 1:04:49.614
Because you know what?

1:04:49.616 --> 1:04:54.418
You are on the express train to
becoming exactly like your mom.

1:04:56.989 --> 1:04:59.622
You're no good for me, ely.

1:04:59.624 --> 1:05:03.359
I am tattooing you at the top
of my no-kiss list.

1:05:03.361 --> 1:05:06.528
I should have<i> always </i>
been tattooed

1:05:06.530 --> 1:05:08.963
At the top of your
no-kiss list, naomi.

1:05:08.965 --> 1:05:11.098
God, give me a break.

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:13.133
I'll give you a break.

1:05:13.135 --> 1:05:15.034
A clean one.

1:05:15.036 --> 1:05:17.603
Let's just do this
once and for all.

1:05:17.605 --> 1:05:21.506
Yaffa cafe, Sunday,
be there.

1:05:23.476 --> 1:05:26.376
( pressing button repeatedly )

1:05:35.153 --> 1:05:36.418
<i> ( door bell jingles )</i>

1:05:45.395 --> 1:05:48.295
Did you not get my--
my texts?

1:05:48.297 --> 1:05:51.197
You're so passive-aggressive now
that you won't even answer me.

1:05:55.569 --> 1:05:58.369
Not gonna talk to me?

1:05:58.371 --> 1:06:01.071
Naomi:<i> If I say now</i>
<i> what I really feel,</i>

1:06:01.073 --> 1:06:05.408
<i> Naomi and ely really never</i>
<i> will be naomi and ely again.</i>

1:06:05.410 --> 1:06:09.211
Let's get this over with.
This is your shit.

1:06:13.083 --> 1:06:14.215
Your turn.

1:06:27.963 --> 1:06:30.697
<i> Don't take back the belt.</i>

1:06:30.699 --> 1:06:33.733
That's the red glitter belt.
Hmm?

1:06:33.735 --> 1:06:37.069
<i> If I keep it...</i>
<i> If you offer it...</i>

1:06:37.071 --> 1:06:39.971
Why don't you keep that?

1:06:39.973 --> 1:06:41.639
<i> ...Then maybe there's hope.</i>

1:06:41.641 --> 1:06:45.042
You know, why don't you--
why don't you just keep it all?

1:06:45.044 --> 1:06:47.177
You can--
you can have all of it.

1:06:57.488 --> 1:07:00.355
You really have
nothing to say?

1:07:00.357 --> 1:07:02.590
<i> I miss you, ely.</i>

1:07:02.592 --> 1:07:06.193
I just, uh--
I don't wanna believe

1:07:06.195 --> 1:07:09.728
That you would give this...
All up over a guy.

1:07:13.166 --> 1:07:15.032
Man:
<i> ¶ I'd talk to you ¶</i>

1:07:15.034 --> 1:07:19.536
<i> ¶ if you weren't proud ¶</i>

1:07:19.538 --> 1:07:26.008
<i> ¶ and I'd run to you</i>
<i> if you weren't running away ¶</i>

1:07:36.285 --> 1:07:39.386
<i> ¶ or did you change... ¶</i>

1:07:39.388 --> 1:07:41.454
Morning, baby.

1:07:41.456 --> 1:07:43.622
Mom, it's 4:00 pm.

1:07:43.624 --> 1:07:45.357
I got you a latte.

1:07:49.629 --> 1:07:51.595
We're still $200 short.

1:07:51.597 --> 1:07:53.763
So they won't put
the electricity back on.

1:08:02.807 --> 1:08:06.608
I really need to talk to you.
Dad, where are you?!

1:08:33.669 --> 1:08:35.635
Hey.

1:08:38.673 --> 1:08:40.271
Is everything
all right in here?

1:08:43.109 --> 1:08:44.575
Yo, dude.

1:08:44.577 --> 1:08:46.443
You're bleeding.

1:08:49.848 --> 1:08:51.180
Hand.

1:08:54.318 --> 1:08:56.184
So what are you doing here?

1:08:56.186 --> 1:08:58.553
Escape the residents.

1:08:58.555 --> 1:09:01.588
Sometimes I, uh,
sneak a smoke.

1:09:03.358 --> 1:09:04.857
<i> Okay, okay.</i>

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:14.565
That's the best I can do.

1:09:14.567 --> 1:09:17.367
You're really sweet,
you know that?

1:09:17.369 --> 1:09:19.168
No, I'm not that sweet.

1:09:19.170 --> 1:09:21.403
You are to me.

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:24.772
- I don't think this is--
- no, it's okay.

1:09:26.742 --> 1:09:29.476
If ely doesn't believe
in the no-kiss list,

1:09:29.478 --> 1:09:32.645
- Neither do I.
- Naomi, you're upset.

1:09:32.647 --> 1:09:34.780
And I think this is
one of these things--

1:09:34.782 --> 1:09:38.617
Don't tell me.
Doorman's code of conduct?

1:09:38.619 --> 1:09:41.553
No, it's the gentleman's
code of conduct.

1:09:41.555 --> 1:09:44.455
Maybe we should have, like,
dinner and a movie?

1:09:50.795 --> 1:09:53.328
You really are
a crappy doorman.

1:10:02.739 --> 1:10:04.772
( whispers )
we'll get there.

1:10:04.774 --> 1:10:07.808
<i> ( pop music plays )</i>

"hedonist."

1:11:09.463 --> 1:11:11.262
A person who sins.

1:11:11.264 --> 1:11:13.697
No. It's a person
who pursues pleasure.

1:11:13.699 --> 1:11:15.699
That's the same thing.
That's the same thing.

1:11:15.701 --> 1:11:17.734
A person who pursues pleasure
is a sinner.

1:11:17.736 --> 1:11:20.303
Why would they also be pursuing
pleasure if not to sin?

1:11:20.305 --> 1:11:22.605
- I get the point.
- "capricious."

1:11:22.607 --> 1:11:25.441
- Capricious means--
- so long, capricious.

1:11:25.443 --> 1:11:28.744
"capricious" means
picking up shit, conveniently.

1:11:28.746 --> 1:11:30.345
I'm never gonna know
the meaning of that word now.

1:11:30.347 --> 1:11:32.714

Busted what, though?
I'm tuning a guitar.

1:12:35.802 --> 1:12:37.701
Is that what you were doing?

1:12:37.703 --> 1:12:39.436
Yeah, I don't play the guitar.
I'm not a songwriter.

1:12:39.438 --> 1:12:40.770
That's weird,
I thought I heard my name.

1:12:40.772 --> 1:12:42.538
- No.
- Being sung. By you.

1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:43.872
- Don't think so.
- That didn't happen?

Well, I made a feast.

1:12:50.746 --> 1:12:52.979
Wanna partake?

1:12:52.981 --> 1:12:54.780
I have a better idea.

1:13:08.928 --> 1:13:10.560
What are we doing?

1:13:10.562 --> 1:13:12.795
Something
you've never done before.

<i> This is amazing.</i>

1:13:35.648 --> 1:13:37.447
And this is a park.

1:13:37.449 --> 1:13:40.049
It's like
in the middle of manhattan.

1:13:40.051 --> 1:13:42.017
- Is it, like, central?
- Central?

1:13:42.019 --> 1:13:44.319
- Yes, it is, it's central.
- Wow!

1:13:44.321 --> 1:13:46.054
- Why would I hate it?
- I don't know.

1:13:46.056 --> 1:13:49.490
Maybe you've been to a million
castles, I don't know.

1:13:49.492 --> 1:13:51.024
I actually have never been
to a castle in my life.

1:13:51.026 --> 1:13:53.026
- I'm beyond excited.
- Okay.

1:13:53.028 --> 1:13:55.061
Is there a princess
living here?

1:13:55.063 --> 1:13:57.029
Soon, in a few seconds.

- Okay! All right!

1:13:58.799 --> 1:14:00.665

- Stop.

Look at that.

- Where?
- Right over here.

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:10.739
A gazebo!

1:14:12.008 --> 1:14:14.108

Somewhere
kind of hidden away.

1:14:20.149 --> 1:14:22.482
Yeah?
Why, you wanna make out?

1:14:22.484 --> 1:14:25.551
Ew, gross.
Why would I wanna do that?

1:14:25.553 --> 1:14:28.153
( chuckles ) no way.

1:14:28.155 --> 1:14:30.622
Oh, no,
this isn't looking good.

1:14:30.624 --> 1:14:31.923
No, it's really good.

- Lies!
- It's not lies.

1:14:34.494 --> 1:14:35.993
You hate it!
You're washing it down.

1:14:35.995 --> 1:14:38.061
I'm not washing it.

my first night on the job

1:14:48.238 --> 1:14:49.770
Was your graduation day?

1:14:49.772 --> 1:14:51.905
( sighs ) I do.

1:14:51.907 --> 1:14:55.508
I watched you and ely
cuddle up on the lobby sofa

1:14:55.510 --> 1:14:57.543
In your gowns until dawn.

1:14:59.513 --> 1:15:02.881
Yeah, that seems
like a long time ago.

1:15:02.883 --> 1:15:05.984
That first night...

1:15:05.986 --> 1:15:08.619
Felt like the first day...

Of the end of my life.

1:15:11.724 --> 1:15:17.060

of your dimpled smile,

1:15:17.062 --> 1:15:18.528
That laugh...

1:15:18.530 --> 1:15:19.795
Oh, god.

1:15:19.797 --> 1:15:23.231
...Gave me the smallest
glimmer of hope.

1:15:23.233 --> 1:15:25.032
And that was all I needed.

1:15:25.034 --> 1:15:27.267
<i> ¶ love is beginning now ¶</i>

1:15:27.269 --> 1:15:28.935
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

1:15:28.937 --> 1:15:35.640
<i> ¶ love is beginning now ¶</i>

1:15:35.642 --> 1:15:37.742
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

1:15:37.744 --> 1:15:40.244
<i> ¶ love is beginning now ¶</i>

1:15:40.246 --> 1:15:41.912
<i> ¶ oh, oh, oh ¶</i>

1:15:41.914 --> 1:15:45.248
<i> ¶ love is beginning now ¶¶</i>

1:15:48.519 --> 1:15:50.218
There he is.

1:15:50.220 --> 1:15:53.754
( chuckles ) I, uh...

1:15:53.756 --> 1:15:56.556
I think I came out
to my mother.

1:15:56.558 --> 1:15:57.657
Oh, bruce.

1:16:00.028 --> 1:16:02.294
What happened?

1:16:02.296 --> 1:16:04.629
I don't know,
we were having breakfast,

1:16:04.631 --> 1:16:09.967
And she asked me what was
going on with that naomi girl.

1:16:09.969 --> 1:16:13.971
I said,
it was kind of over,

1:16:13.973 --> 1:16:17.541
And, god, I could have
just left it at that.

1:16:17.543 --> 1:16:20.210
Only I didn't wanna lie.

1:16:20.212 --> 1:16:24.080
So I said, I've been
spending a lot of time

1:16:24.082 --> 1:16:26.749
With this guy ely.

1:16:26.751 --> 1:16:31.954
And then I added,
"he's my kind of boyfriend."

1:16:37.127 --> 1:16:39.627
What did she say?

1:16:39.629 --> 1:16:41.829
She said, um,
( chuckles )

1:16:41.831 --> 1:16:45.098
"does this mean you're gay?"

1:16:45.100 --> 1:16:47.934
And I said, "no.

1:16:47.936 --> 1:16:50.803
It just means
I'm not straight."

1:16:50.805 --> 1:16:53.638
And then the morning
just continued.

1:16:56.943 --> 1:16:59.677
She didn't say "I love you."

1:16:59.679 --> 1:17:01.845
And she didn't say
"I hate you."

1:17:14.325 --> 1:17:16.792
Is that your, uh--
is that your documentary?

1:17:16.794 --> 1:17:19.027
Um, yeah.

1:17:21.231 --> 1:17:24.031
<i> I lied to ely when I told him</i>
<i> I forgive his mom</i>

1:17:24.033 --> 1:17:26.299
<i> For what happened</i>
<i> between our parents.</i>

1:17:26.301 --> 1:17:30.002
<i> But I'm happy for him that</i>
<i> they're working things out.</i>

1:17:32.306 --> 1:17:34.606
<i> Even though mine aren't.</i>

1:17:34.608 --> 1:17:38.009
<i> I don't think it was dad</i>
<i> choosing a lesbian over mom</i>

1:17:38.011 --> 1:17:40.945
<i> That most damaged her sense</i>
<i> of her...</i>

1:17:40.947 --> 1:17:44.782
<i> Own... Femininity.</i>

1:17:44.784 --> 1:17:46.650
<i> I think it was--</i>

1:17:49.121 --> 1:17:52.055
<i> Losing her marriage to a woman</i>
<i> she called friend.</i>

1:17:58.796 --> 1:18:00.162
<i> Next question.</i>

1:18:02.199 --> 1:18:04.265
I am such an asshole.

1:18:08.371 --> 1:18:11.138
Today, we will be
exploring the theory

1:18:11.140 --> 1:18:14.841
Of the unfulfillable
female desire for a phallus

1:18:14.843 --> 1:18:17.142
<i> As envisioned by freud.</i>

1:18:20.313 --> 1:18:23.814
( both laugh )

1:18:23.816 --> 1:18:26.249
Is there something funny
you'd like to share

1:18:26.251 --> 1:18:28.951
With the entire class?

1:18:28.953 --> 1:18:30.185
I'm sorry.

1:18:30.187 --> 1:18:33.188
( snickers )

1:18:33.190 --> 1:18:38.026
<i>The theory of the unfulfillable</i>
<i>female desire for a phallus...</i>

1:18:38.028 --> 1:18:41.729
I've been broken up
with ely for 36 days,

1:18:41.731 --> 1:18:44.231
Nine hours,
and seven minutes.

1:18:44.233 --> 1:18:46.199
I'm actually okay.

1:18:46.201 --> 1:18:50.669
But still sometimes--

1:18:50.671 --> 1:18:52.837
All the time...

1:18:52.839 --> 1:18:54.205
I miss him.

1:18:56.442 --> 1:19:00.243
Look, I know that
I think that culottes are neat

1:19:00.245 --> 1:19:04.747
And that I say "neat."

1:19:04.749 --> 1:19:07.750
Remind me again why you and ely
are still fighting.

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:12.453
Are you gonna hold onto
this forever?

1:19:17.059 --> 1:19:19.359
Naomi:<i> How could I be in college</i>
<i> and be so dumb?</i>

1:19:21.363 --> 1:19:23.763
<i> I've been holding on</i>
<i> to the naomi and ely fantasy,</i>

1:19:23.765 --> 1:19:26.732
<i> But that's just it.</i>

1:19:26.734 --> 1:19:28.433
<i> It was a fantasy.</i>

1:19:28.435 --> 1:19:31.469
<i> Ely was just being who he is.</i>

1:19:31.471 --> 1:19:33.737
<i> And I love who ely is.</i>

1:19:33.739 --> 1:19:36.372

1:20:00.164 --> 1:20:03.231

1:20:03.233 --> 1:20:05.166
Wake up! Wake up!

1:20:05.168 --> 1:20:07.902
Naomi, what the--
what the--

1:20:07.904 --> 1:20:10.271
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

1:20:10.273 --> 1:20:12.239
He's not coming back!

1:20:14.276 --> 1:20:16.743
I know.

1:20:16.745 --> 1:20:19.479
( laughs )

1:20:19.481 --> 1:20:20.947
I know.

1:20:27.354 --> 1:20:32.323
I can't keep avoiding my former
best friend across the hall.

1:20:32.325 --> 1:20:36.126
And you can't keep clinging on
to the memories of dad.

1:20:40.031 --> 1:20:44.299
At some point...
We have to let go.

1:20:46.770 --> 1:20:48.870
I was afraid of that.

1:20:48.872 --> 1:20:50.104
Me too.

1:21:03.352 --> 1:21:06.286
Naomi:<i> There's no way for me</i>
<i>to know if he can find me here.</i>

1:21:06.288 --> 1:21:09.856
<i> I didn't call.</i>
<i> I didn't text.</i>

1:21:09.858 --> 1:21:12.358
<i> I left it up</i>
<i> to that old connection,</i>

1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:15.461
<i> That old friendship sense.</i>

1:21:15.463 --> 1:21:18.931
<i> That and I left the red</i>
<i>glitter belt on his front door.</i>

1:21:23.537 --> 1:21:25.803
You found me.

1:21:25.805 --> 1:21:27.905
Hi.

1:21:38.516 --> 1:21:41.149
You think, uh,
we still add up?

1:21:45.855 --> 1:21:48.088
( sighs )

1:21:48.090 --> 1:21:52.525
I think that we should
get married right here.

1:21:54.428 --> 1:21:55.994
Ely?

1:21:58.064 --> 1:21:59.829
We're never getting married.

1:22:03.034 --> 1:22:04.400
I'm sorry.

1:22:04.402 --> 1:22:06.402
I'm sorry, too.

1:22:08.305 --> 1:22:09.370
For everything.

1:22:11.374 --> 1:22:13.440
So...

1:22:13.442 --> 1:22:16.042
Bruce, huh?
( laughs )

1:22:16.044 --> 1:22:18.210
( chuckles )

1:22:18.212 --> 1:22:20.011
( sniffles )

1:22:20.013 --> 1:22:21.345
Yeah.

1:22:21.347 --> 1:22:24.514
Wouldn't it figure
that the first time

1:22:24.516 --> 1:22:28.484
That you're in love and in
a monogamous relationship,

1:22:28.486 --> 1:22:32.154
It would be with my boyfriend.
( laughs )

1:22:36.460 --> 1:22:40.161
You know, it was gabriel
who made me the mix tape.

1:22:40.163 --> 1:22:42.263
He makes me these amazing mixes

1:22:42.265 --> 1:22:45.532
And I'm so supposed to find
the hidden meaning

1:22:45.534 --> 1:22:48.067
And make him one back.

1:22:48.069 --> 1:22:50.335
Which I'm not very good at.

1:22:53.206 --> 1:22:54.438
Yeah.

1:22:57.876 --> 1:23:00.443
Are we okay?

1:23:00.445 --> 1:23:02.878
Yeah, we're okay.

1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:05.046
We're where we need to be.

1:23:20.463 --> 1:23:22.563
I really love you.

1:23:26.435 --> 1:23:27.967
Meeya more.

1:23:39.347 --> 1:23:41.647
- It's a playlist.
- Flash drive?

1:23:41.649 --> 1:23:44.582
Um, I have really bad taste
in music.

1:23:46.452 --> 1:23:48.518
Like me anyway?

1:23:48.520 --> 1:23:51.120
'cause I really think
I could like you, too.

1:23:51.122 --> 1:23:54.223
All right, well,
let's see here.

1:23:54.225 --> 1:23:56.425
Bon jovi...

1:23:56.427 --> 1:23:58.427
And britney spears.

1:23:58.429 --> 1:23:59.761
I tried to warn you.

1:24:02.499 --> 1:24:04.765
Oh, boy.

1:24:04.767 --> 1:24:06.466
I'm coming for you.

- What's with you?
- Just aced my sats.

1:24:24.316 --> 1:24:26.215
So you might want
to take these.

1:24:26.217 --> 1:24:28.350
Start studying now.
That's my suggestion.

1:24:28.352 --> 1:24:31.186
Hey, jealous
about naomi and gabriel?

1:24:31.188 --> 1:24:32.720
Nope!
I do not care.

1:24:32.722 --> 1:24:34.087
Oh, you're jealous.

1:25:03.147 --> 1:25:05.180
"breakfast at tiffany's."

1:25:05.182 --> 1:25:06.514
Come on.

1:25:06.516 --> 1:25:09.149

Naomi:<i> It's bullshit</i>

<i> And romance</i>
<i> as being different.</i>

1:25:27.233 --> 1:25:29.199
<i> They're not.</i>

1:25:29.201 --> 1:25:31.367
<i> They're just variations</i>
<i> of the same love,</i>

1:25:31.369 --> 1:25:34.570
<i> Variations of the same desire</i>
<i> to be close.</i>

1:25:34.572 --> 1:25:38.740
<i> And like any love,</i>
<i> it's difficult, awesome,</i>

1:25:38.742 --> 1:25:41.843
<i> Treacherous, exhilarating,</i>

1:25:41.845 --> 1:25:45.146
<i> Confusing,</i>
<i> and... Precious.</i>

1:25:45.148 --> 1:25:46.647
So what are you up to later?

1:25:46.649 --> 1:25:48.749
Dinner with bruce.

1:25:48.751 --> 1:25:51.151
It's our four-month
anniversary.

1:25:56.657 --> 1:25:59.424
Gabriel scored a sweet new gig

Yeah, guess that makes me
a groupie.

1:26:03.662 --> 1:26:05.461
Want any hard advice?

1:26:05.463 --> 1:26:09.797

this one out...

1:26:09.799 --> 1:26:11.331

Tell me.

1:26:19.139 --> 1:26:21.706
