WEBVTT

00:09.625 --> 00:11.616
That's it for today, Seattle.

00:11.877 --> 00:16.393
This is Doctor Frasier Crane wishing you
good day and good mental health.

00:17.507 --> 00:20.419
Move it.
Person waiting for the booth here.

00:20.719 --> 00:24.075
That is not amusing in the men's room.
It's not amusing now.

00:24.389 --> 00:27.142
- All ready then, Bulldog?
- What are you two doing?

00:27.434 --> 00:30.267
We're recording an ad for a new sponsor.

00:30.562 --> 00:34.032
By the way, Roz, baby or no baby,
your ass has never looked better.

00:34.358 --> 00:35.347
Shut up.

00:37.194 --> 00:39.708
- How sick is that?
- He's just being Bulldog.

00:39.988 --> 00:41.979
No, that I liked hearing it.

00:42.950 --> 00:46.465
- Hi, I'm Bulldog Brisco.
- And I'm Gil Chesterton.

00:46.787 --> 00:49.096
When Bulldog and I are out together...

00:49.373 --> 00:53.161
- Whether it's at the opera.
- Or rooting our Mariners to victory.

00:53.502 --> 00:55.493
We always round out the evening

00:55.754 --> 00:58.314
with a nice, relaxing cup
of Happy Dreams Tea.

00:58.590 --> 01:02.185
We're making some right now.
How many lumps do you like, Gil?

01:02.511 --> 01:03.500
One, please.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.870
Ouch! Gets me every time.

01:06.974 --> 01:12.207
Happy Dreams Tea. One cup, you'll have
happy dreams the whole night through.

01:12.604 --> 01:14.196
Yes. Perfect. One take.

01:14.439 --> 01:16.999
My "ouch"
could be a bit more convincing.

01:17.568 --> 01:19.604
We'll splice that in later.

01:21.572 --> 01:24.609
- What was that?
- It's the new station manager's idea.

01:24.908 --> 01:27.900
He's getting on-air talent
to record commercials for sponsors.

01:28.203 --> 01:31.240
Are you disappointed
he didn't ask you to do it?

01:31.540 --> 01:35.294
About as disappointed as when
that hypnotist picked them to come up

01:35.627 --> 01:37.936
and groom each other like monkeys.

01:38.213 --> 01:43.287
Yeah, you really lucked out. He didn't
make you do anything silly. No, sir.

01:43.677 --> 01:44.951
Roz.

01:45.804 --> 01:47.840
Daphne, what're you doing here?

01:48.098 --> 01:50.976
Dr Crane's car's in the shop,
so I'm a chauffeur.

01:51.268 --> 01:55.022
- There's a rally on Pike Street.
- What sort of rally?

01:55.355 --> 01:58.427
They're trying to save a bookstore
from being torn down.

01:58.734 --> 02:00.565
Not Hirsch and Sons?

02:00.819 --> 02:05.335
- They want to build a strip mall.
- That's a Seattle landmark.

02:05.699 --> 02:08.133
My God, Mark Twain gave a reading there.

02:08.410 --> 02:13.438
I know that place. I had a boyfriend who
liked to make out in the occult section.

02:15.209 --> 02:19.248
I'm terribly upset about this.
We'll go down there and join that rally.

02:19.588 --> 02:20.703
Good for you.

02:20.923 --> 02:25.439
I refuse to stand by while some bully
rides roughshod over the little people.

02:25.802 --> 02:29.477
- I don't want to go to a rally.
- Tough luck. You're the chauffeur.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.195 --> 02:47.234
This is rather exciting. I never
thought you to be the protest kind.

02:47.574 --> 02:50.691
I was quite the activist
in my college days.

02:50.994 --> 02:53.827
Nothing like throwing in
with a band of young rebels

02:54.122 --> 02:56.192
thumbing their noses at convention.

02:56.458 --> 02:59.609
Did you go for the whole package?
Long hair, beads?

02:59.920 --> 03:04.357
No, I did have a pair of psychedelic
suspenders that raised an eyebrow.

03:04.716 --> 03:07.150
This seems good, don't you think?

03:09.012 --> 03:13.483
Hey, this is great. Hey, look,
everybody, it's Dr Frasier Crane.

03:15.936 --> 03:17.574
Hello. Good to see you.

03:17.813 --> 03:22.443
- Would you like to say a few words?
- Well, all right. I'll keep it simple.

03:22.818 --> 03:27.096
Be strong, people.
Our cause is just. To the barricades.

03:29.283 --> 03:31.433
This is sort of fun, isn't it?

03:31.702 --> 03:34.091
People, this is your final warning.

03:34.371 --> 03:36.726
- What's that?
- It's the police.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.991
Disperse now, or we will take action.

03:40.294 --> 03:44.173
- What do you they mean by that?
- We're not going anywhere, are we?

03:44.506 --> 03:48.704
- Are they talking about a jail thing?
- Who knows? Exciting, isn't it?

03:49.052 --> 03:51.725
They'll have to drag us out of here.

03:52.014 --> 03:55.086
They don't actually
drag people away anymore, do they?

03:55.392 --> 03:58.748
Cos they're too afraid to arrest us,
aren't they?

03:59.062 --> 04:01.656
Now you're just provoking them.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.534
All right, people, you had your warning.

04:06.820 --> 04:09.288
They weren't kidding.

04:09.573 --> 04:13.009
There go
the first lucky martyrs to our cause.

04:15.204 --> 04:17.764
At the rate
they're dragging people away,

04:18.040 --> 04:21.714
there'll be nobody left to protest.
I better get reinforcements.

04:22.043 --> 04:24.717
Dr Crane, where are you going?

04:25.005 --> 04:26.996
Solidarity, brothers.

04:41.647 --> 04:44.036
- Hello, Niles.
- I hope you're free tonight.

04:44.316 --> 04:48.150
I just secured a table at the most
exclusive new restaurant in Seattle.

04:48.487 --> 04:50.876
- I'm not in the mood.
- At least hear me out.

04:51.156 --> 04:54.034
This place is the hottest new thing
in fusion cuisine.

04:54.326 --> 04:56.601
What cuisines are being fused?

04:56.870 --> 05:02.740
Polynesian and Scandinavian.
It's called Mahalo Valhalla.

05:05.629 --> 05:09.622
Perhaps there's a reason God
put those two countries so far apart.

05:10.008 --> 05:15.162
My gourmet newsletter gave three and
a half whisks to their coconut herring.

05:17.766 --> 05:21.236
I'm sorry, Niles.
Tonight's just a bad night.

05:21.562 --> 05:25.919
Daphne's been hauled down to jail.
Dad's down there trying to bail her out.

05:26.275 --> 05:29.506
- What?
- They should be home any minute.

05:29.820 --> 05:34.177
It's just that she was down at that
rally for Hirsch and Sons bookstore.

05:34.533 --> 05:37.127
The worst part of it
is I convinced her to go.

05:37.411 --> 05:42.280
When they started hauling people away,
I chickened out and ran.

05:43.166 --> 05:47.398
- You left her there?
- It was a shameful performance.

05:48.338 --> 05:51.569
But I did clear that hedge
in front of Emerson's Funeral Home

05:51.884 --> 05:54.398
like a Kentucky show horse, but...

05:57.097 --> 05:59.736
What has happened to me, Niles?

06:00.017 --> 06:04.135
I used to be so courageous,
to fight for things.

06:06.023 --> 06:09.618
When did I become so middle-aged,
so timid?

06:09.943 --> 06:14.459
Don't be so hard on yourself. We all
get a bit more cautious as we get older.

06:14.823 --> 06:18.941
Not me. God, it was only five years ago
I packed up my whole life in Boston,

06:19.286 --> 06:23.484
moved across the country to start over.
That took real courage.

06:23.832 --> 06:26.392
Now, the biggest risk I take
is saying to Dad,

06:26.668 --> 06:29.865
"Let's go out to dinner.
You pick the restaurant."

06:32.174 --> 06:35.211
Daphne, it's so good
to have you home safe and sound.

06:35.510 --> 06:36.943
Sod off.

06:37.179 --> 06:40.933
- She's a little mad at you.
- Yes, thank you, Dad.

06:41.266 --> 06:42.665
Daphne,

06:42.893 --> 06:46.488
I am so sorry. I feel just terrible.

06:46.813 --> 06:49.646
As you should.
You left me handcuffed and helpless.

06:49.942 --> 06:53.901
If you're ever in that position again,
be sure to call on me.

06:58.951 --> 07:01.146
For help.

07:01.411 --> 07:04.483
Thank you, Dr Crane.
Shame on you, Dr Crane.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.862
Why can't you be more like Dr Crane?

07:08.168 --> 07:10.762
It took me six hours to get her out.

07:11.046 --> 07:13.844
In my days
cops could count on a few perks.

07:14.132 --> 07:18.330
No speeding tickets. Get your friends
out of jail fast. It's all gone to hell.

07:18.679 --> 07:20.829
Let's hope they never do away with that

07:21.098 --> 07:24.488
"all jewellery up for grabs
in the morgue" policy.

07:26.937 --> 07:30.896
I'm not letting this dinner reservation
go to waste. Frasier?

07:31.233 --> 07:36.353
- Thanks anyway, Niles.
- Very well. Dad, what about you?

07:37.990 --> 07:40.299
Maybe I will come
and get a bite with you.

07:40.576 --> 07:44.774
Sitting around six hours in that
station house, I could eat anything.

07:45.122 --> 07:47.192
- Let's go, then.
- I can't wait.

07:48.292 --> 07:50.248
Where are we going, anyway?

07:51.461 --> 07:55.420
Hello? Yes, I'd like
to order a large pizza.

07:55.757 --> 07:58.191
What toppings? Just a second.

07:59.511 --> 08:01.502
Dad, what do you want on your pizza?

08:02.848 --> 08:04.964
- Pepperoni.
- Pepperoni, please.

08:06.310 --> 08:10.223
<i>We've been fighting a lot
and she's never in the mood for sex.</i>

08:10.564 --> 08:12.555
<i>I think she's having an affair.</i>

08:12.816 --> 08:15.091
Let's not give in to paranoia.

08:15.360 --> 08:20.434
Just because your wife is avoiding sex
doesn't mean she's being unfaithful.

08:20.824 --> 08:23.384
You said
you haven't been talking lately.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.175
Why don't you try re-opening
the lines of communication tonight

08:27.497 --> 08:30.773
by surprising her with a nice,
romantic dinner?

08:31.084 --> 08:34.554
<i>Tonight's no good. She's working late
on her boss' boat again.</i>

08:38.008 --> 08:40.522
<i>But tomorrow's OK.
Thanks, Dr Crane.</i>

08:44.640 --> 08:47.837
Roz, what do you say we turn things over
to our eye on the sky,

08:48.143 --> 08:50.338
Chopper Dave, with the traffic report?

08:51.980 --> 08:55.495
I want to introduce you
to our new station manager, Kenny Daly.

08:55.817 --> 08:56.966
It's a pleasure.

08:57.194 --> 09:01.267
No, it's my pleasure.
I have to say, I'm just a huge fan.

09:02.950 --> 09:06.943
I only had this reaction once before.
You ever hear of Norman Mailer?

09:07.287 --> 09:08.606
Of course, the author.

09:08.830 --> 09:12.584
No, I'm talking about
the drive-time guy, worked out of Tampa?

09:12.918 --> 09:17.275
"Norman in the Mornin"'.
So funny you'd pray for traffic.

09:17.631 --> 09:23.422
I'll try to catch him the next time
I'm in Tampa. In the mornin'.

09:24.471 --> 09:27.224
- It's been great meeting you.
- You, too.

09:28.559 --> 09:31.437
I got a call
from the Happy Dreams Tea people.

09:31.728 --> 09:36.085
They had spots scheduled for your
first hour and you forgot to read them.

09:36.441 --> 09:39.797
I didn't forget. I looked at the copy
and I couldn't read it.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.864
Why not?

09:42.114 --> 09:44.753
Well, just listen to this.

09:45.033 --> 09:48.662
"One cup of Happy Dreams Tea and
you'll have happy dreams all night."

09:48.996 --> 09:52.306
Dreams are a by-product
of unresolved emotion.

09:52.624 --> 09:55.297
No tea can promise happy dreams.

09:56.461 --> 09:58.656
I totally get that.

09:59.214 --> 10:02.604
Our ad revenues are down
and they're a major new sponsor.

10:02.926 --> 10:05.884
I promised them that you'd read
the ads this hour.

10:06.179 --> 10:09.649
As a psychiatrist, I can't.
They promise something impossible.

10:09.975 --> 10:14.924
Now I understand. What if
we just think of it more as a slogan?

10:15.314 --> 10:18.067
But it's not a slogan.
If I, as a doctor, read it,

10:18.358 --> 10:23.751
- it sounds like medical advice.
- OK. Now, totally get it.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.556
Instead of saying Dr Frasier Crane,
don't say "doctor".

10:29.870 --> 10:35.069
I'm not making myself clear here. Let's
try this. I will never read this copy.

10:36.418 --> 10:40.570
This is the part of my job I hate.
You take a stand like that

10:40.923 --> 10:44.836
and I totally respect it, by the way,
and you force my hand.

10:45.177 --> 10:50.376
That's our biggest sponsor. Unless
you go on the air and read that ad,

10:50.766 --> 10:53.155
I have to fire you.

10:54.394 --> 10:55.793
Ten seconds, Frasier.

10:59.233 --> 11:03.624
I didn't realise you felt so strongly
about it. I guess I have no choice.

11:03.987 --> 11:06.581
Thanks, Dr Crane. What a relief.

11:15.040 --> 11:16.359
Hello, Seattle.

11:16.583 --> 11:21.213
The people who know me best will not be
surprised by what I'm about to tell you.

11:21.588 --> 11:24.466
I am not a man

11:24.758 --> 11:27.226
who betrays his principles.

11:27.511 --> 11:29.820
I am not a man
who misleads his listeners

11:30.097 --> 11:33.373
and I am not a man
who will shrink from a fight.

11:33.684 --> 11:37.199
Today, I find myself in a fight
over the content of my show.

11:37.521 --> 11:40.593
But rather than truckle to the forces
of commercialism,

11:40.899 --> 11:44.687
I've decided to take a stand
on principle, even it means...

11:46.321 --> 11:49.757
- I'm not on the air, am I?
- No. He put on the <i>Best of Crane.</i>

11:50.659 --> 11:53.890
- How much did I get out?
- Well, let's see.

11:54.204 --> 11:58.322
<i>People who know me best will not be
surprised by what I'm about to tell you.</i>

11:58.667 --> 12:00.976
<i>I am not a man...</i>

12:09.052 --> 12:10.041
Perfect.

12:15.183 --> 12:16.901
So they fired you?

12:17.144 --> 12:22.013
Yes. And I must say it feels good
to take a stand like this.

12:22.399 --> 12:26.358
I feel like my old self again. I'll tell
you one thing, I don't envy Kenny.

12:26.695 --> 12:29.334
Feeling the cold stares
of the other employees

12:29.615 --> 12:32.812
because he's fired
the station's most popular personality.

12:33.118 --> 12:36.155
He fired Tooty the Story Lady, too?

12:36.997 --> 12:38.635
Very funny, Niles.

12:38.874 --> 12:42.867
Who would have thought that getting
fired can make one feel so alive?

12:45.672 --> 12:49.870
What do you want?
Another staring contest, I suppose?

12:50.219 --> 12:53.370
Well, you picked the wrong day for that.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.266
Take that.

13:01.188 --> 13:05.306
- Frasier, what are you doing home?
- Dad, brace yourself.

13:05.651 --> 13:09.405
The station fired me. So you'll
be seeing me this time every day.

13:09.738 --> 13:12.491
That's terrible.

13:12.783 --> 13:16.492
- I assume you mean the firing part.
- Well, yeah.

13:16.828 --> 13:18.420
So what happened?

13:18.664 --> 13:23.454
They asked me to violate a principle
I believe in and I refused.

13:23.835 --> 13:26.349
I'm proud of you.
What did they want you to do?

13:26.630 --> 13:30.782
There's this product and they wanted me
to say it gives people happy dreams.

13:31.134 --> 13:32.328
And?

13:33.262 --> 13:36.015
I couldn't make a claim like that.

13:36.306 --> 13:39.218
All commercials promise things
they can't deliver.

13:39.518 --> 13:40.507
That may be...

13:40.727 --> 13:42.718
Like cologne driving women wild.

13:42.980 --> 13:46.370
I used it all my life and never
had a single woman come on to me.

13:46.692 --> 13:50.924
- Except that year I worked in Vice.
- Yes, I understand.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.955
- But that wasn't about cologne.
- Yes, I understand.

13:55.284 --> 13:57.923
- They were hookers.
- I realise that!

14:04.251 --> 14:08.130
Frasier, don't be angry with me,
but I do have one theory.

14:08.463 --> 14:12.172
I was wondering when you'd get around
to that so, allow me.

14:12.509 --> 14:16.468
I was so ashamed of my chickening out
at the rally

14:16.805 --> 14:20.115
that I grabbed at the first fight
that came my way.

14:20.434 --> 14:23.392
It turned out to be the wrong fight
and I lost my job.

14:23.687 --> 14:26.360
So if you follow that theory
through to the end,

14:26.648 --> 14:29.879
this heady feeling of euphoria
I'm experiencing right now

14:30.194 --> 14:33.266
is nothing more
than a deep-seated denial.

14:33.572 --> 14:36.245
- So have you considered it?
- Not for a second.

14:41.872 --> 14:42.861
Hello.

14:43.081 --> 14:45.390
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

14:45.667 --> 14:49.103
but since I fired you,
I haven't been able to eat or sleep.

14:49.421 --> 14:51.616
Kenny, it's only been
an hour and a half.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.789
Well, I'm a napper.

14:59.181 --> 15:00.773
I was wrong.

15:01.016 --> 15:05.885
I just fired a man who was willing
to go to the mat for his principles.

15:06.271 --> 15:10.059
What does that say about mine? Before
I go on, have you had any job offers?

15:10.400 --> 15:12.834
He's had four. Shut up.

15:13.111 --> 15:15.102
I'm still technically available.

15:15.364 --> 15:19.403
I'd like you to come back to work.
I'm calling the Happy Dreams people

15:19.743 --> 15:22.576
and telling them
you're uncomfortable with their ads.

15:22.871 --> 15:25.465
At KACL, the talent comes first.

15:25.749 --> 15:29.298
Well, what can I say but...
see you tomorrow.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.664
This is so great. I'm so relieved.

15:31.922 --> 15:35.073
Can I buy you a beer
just to show we have no hard feelings?

15:35.384 --> 15:39.900
I would love that. As long as
I don't have to endorse it afterwards.

15:40.264 --> 15:43.654
I guess I had that one coming.
Nice meeting you.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.777
Good afternoon, Seattle,
this is Dr Frasier Crane

15:50.065 --> 15:52.625
and I would like to begin today
by apologising

15:52.901 --> 15:55.893
for my abrupt departure
from the airwaves yesterday.

15:56.196 --> 16:01.111
You see, I was embroiled
in a conflict with the management.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.768
I'm happy to report it's been resolved,

16:04.037 --> 16:06.676
thanks to the efforts
of our new station manager,

16:06.957 --> 16:09.676
a courageous and principled
young man, Ken Daly.

16:09.960 --> 16:15.876
I won't bore you with all the details,
but he took on the big guys and won.

16:17.885 --> 16:21.924
Anyway, I apologise
for our brief interruption yesterday

16:22.264 --> 16:25.859
and I assure you that today's
will be even briefer.

16:26.184 --> 16:28.618
Roz, let's go to commercial.

16:30.188 --> 16:34.864
- Kenny, what's going on?
- It's the darndest thing. I got fired.

16:35.235 --> 16:37.465
What? Well, how did that happen?

16:37.738 --> 16:40.536
I told the sponsors
you wouldn't be reading their ads.

16:40.824 --> 16:44.260
Then I'm called into Mr Martin's office
in the Black Tower.

16:44.578 --> 16:47.456
I said sponsors
are easier to replace than talent.

16:47.748 --> 16:50.387
He said I was easier to replace
than anybody.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.784
Then he called me
a pinhead and took my Coke away.

16:56.131 --> 16:57.803
That's terrible.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.759
Kenny, I can't help feeling
that this is all my fault.

17:02.095 --> 17:05.609
These things happen. If I've got
to get fired sticking up for someone,

17:05.933 --> 17:07.924
I'm honoured it was for you.

17:08.185 --> 17:12.416
At least now I'll have time to finish
building that nursery. We're expecting.

17:13.190 --> 17:16.704
There's my wife now. She'll
get a kick out of this coincidence.

17:17.027 --> 17:19.540
Me and her getting fired
in the same week.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.811
- May I?
- Of course.

17:25.285 --> 17:29.403
- We have got to get Kenny's job back.
- How are we supposed to do that?

17:29.748 --> 17:32.626
We'll just round up all the talent,
go down to Mr Martin

17:32.918 --> 17:34.954
and demand that he rehire Kenny.

17:35.212 --> 17:38.204
He owns the station.
We can't give him an ultimatum.

17:38.507 --> 17:41.783
It's not an ultimatum.
We'll appeal to his sense of decency.

17:42.094 --> 17:44.085
Kenny went to bat for me.

17:44.346 --> 17:48.134
Kenny hasn't asked for our help.
For all we know, he'll be fine.

17:48.475 --> 17:50.989
How do you like that?
She's having twins.

17:52.938 --> 17:55.975
Heck of a time
for me to lose my insurance.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.266
Well, you guys take care.

18:09.246 --> 18:14.604
Together we can do this. The important
thing is to present a united front.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.118
What is the matter with you people?

18:17.379 --> 18:18.778
We're frightened.

18:19.006 --> 18:20.997
- Of what?
- Of everything.

18:21.258 --> 18:26.127
We're in the Black Tower. Those lobby
guards must have been seven feet tall.

18:26.513 --> 18:29.630
And that metal detector
we had to go through was scary.

18:29.933 --> 18:33.323
It was even scarier
finding out Gil wears an anklet.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.840
Get off the elevator, all of you!

18:36.106 --> 18:39.496
I'm ashamed of you.
Intimidated by a building.

18:40.569 --> 18:45.404
We're here for Kenny, the man who wants
to start KACL daycare, Roz.

18:45.782 --> 18:50.060
The man who approved the airbrushing
charges on your publicity photos, Gil.

18:50.412 --> 18:54.291
And, Tooty, who was it that just
doubled the <i>Story Time</i> puppet budget?

18:54.625 --> 18:58.413
I know Kenny's a great guy
but I met Joe Martin once.

18:58.754 --> 19:04.590
He was a very scary man
with eyes as cold as a winter night...

19:05.010 --> 19:07.001
All right, Tooty.

19:08.639 --> 19:11.073
Mr Martin. Hello.

19:11.350 --> 19:14.820
- Do you have an appointment?
- My name is Dr Frasier Crane.

19:15.145 --> 19:17.215
I am here with some talent from KACL.

19:17.481 --> 19:20.439
My producer, Roz Doyle.
Gil Chesterton, food critic.

19:20.734 --> 19:23.567
Bob Brisco, sports.
Tooty Feingold, the Story Lady.

19:23.862 --> 19:28.174
Ray Schmidt, the Green Grocer
and Miss Judy, arts and crafts.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.764
Sorry, Judy,
I don't know your last name.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.106
I'm in the middle of a board meeting.

19:33.372 --> 19:38.207
This will only take a moment.
This morning you fired Kenny Daly,

19:38.585 --> 19:41.497
a wonderful station manager
and a man of integrity.

19:41.797 --> 19:44.709
That is a very rare quality
in this industry.

19:45.008 --> 19:47.602
You fire all the Kenny Dalys,
what are you left with?

19:47.886 --> 19:51.037
A bunch of sycophants and yes-men.
Am I right?

19:53.850 --> 19:58.560
Now it would be a great risk
to hire Kenny back.

19:58.939 --> 20:04.809
But a man that stops taking risks
in life pays a very dear price indeed.

20:05.237 --> 20:09.753
I know whereof I speak. And I can see
that I'm getting through to you,

20:10.117 --> 20:14.872
so let me just leave you
with one last question.

20:15.247 --> 20:19.684
What kind of radio station do you want?

20:20.043 --> 20:25.834
Dr Crane, that is the exact question
I've been asking myself

20:26.258 --> 20:30.217
all through that board meeting.
As you know, our ratings are down,

20:30.554 --> 20:33.626
and the number crunchers in there
think they can fix it

20:33.932 --> 20:38.005
by sucking up to our sponsors.
Well, that's not what I think.

20:38.353 --> 20:41.868
Thanks to you,
I'm going with my gut on this one.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.658
- You bet you are.
- I'm going to go in there

20:44.943 --> 20:47.980
and tell them we're doing it my way.
No more talk.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.508
Exactly. Action.

20:49.740 --> 20:55.610
No, no more talk radio. From this moment
on, the station is all Latino music,

20:56.038 --> 20:58.188
all the time.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.652
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you, Dr Crane.

21:00.918 --> 21:03.432
I'm going back to my roots.

21:03.712 --> 21:07.591
I may have walked out of that meeting
Joe Martin, corporate sell-out,

21:07.925 --> 21:12.999
but I'm walking back in José Martinez,
risk taker.

21:19.603 --> 21:22.356
- What just happened?
- You just got us all fired.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.367
- What did you say?
- All right, don't panic!
