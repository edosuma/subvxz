WEBVTT

00:02.516 --> 00:03.600
Keep moving.

00:03.601 --> 00:04.906
Where the hell
were you guys last week?

00:06.590 --> 00:08.458
We're getting a foster kid.
It's lots of work.

00:08.492 --> 00:09.959
$384 a month.

00:09.994 --> 00:11.394
A lot of those foster kids
are messed up.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.029
That's why they need
a positive influence.

00:14.064 --> 00:15.732
That's for screwing my husband.

00:22.106 --> 00:24.440
Kiss me and I'll cut
your fucking tongue out.

00:24.475 --> 00:27.310
I'm taking the PSATs for some
Polish kid over at Ridgedale.

00:28.913 --> 00:31.748
I'm an investigator for the
Educational Evaluation Service.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.917
What's the punishment?
I'm at the University of Chicago.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.018
Come to my office.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.946
Going to the store today!

02:45.082 --> 02:46.849
Toilet paper.

02:46.884 --> 02:49.352
I'm starting to chafe
from the streamers.

02:50.387 --> 02:51.487
Toothpaste.

02:58.162 --> 02:59.529
Why are Steve's clothes
down here?

02:59.563 --> 03:02.899
Somebody couldn't wait to
get upstairs last night.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.534
We out of diapers?
Yeah, but I put

03:04.568 --> 03:06.035
a plug up his butt.

03:06.070 --> 03:07.704
Didn't I, buddy?
Oh, it's okay.

03:07.738 --> 03:09.205
That towel's gonna leak.

03:09.239 --> 03:10.373
Yeah, I'm on it.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.742
So, my SAT gig's
a bust, but, uh,

03:12.776 --> 03:14.911
I can scrape up some money another
way if you need the help.

03:14.945 --> 03:17.146
It's cool.
I got 35 bucks.

03:17.181 --> 03:18.981
Plus, I'm picking up
that temp check later.

03:19.016 --> 03:19.916
Okay.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.351
Is that a Taser?

03:21.385 --> 03:22.418
Where'd you get that?

03:22.453 --> 03:24.220
I let him borrow it.
Hey, help me out.

03:24.254 --> 03:25.822
Carl finally got

03:25.856 --> 03:27.256
invited someplace
by normal kids.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.425
Robbie Rebello's
having a paintball party.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.427
- Towel?
- Yeah, but he's not going,

03:31.462 --> 03:32.428
so I gave him

03:32.463 --> 03:33.529
the Taser to play with.

03:34.531 --> 03:36.366
Don't worry. It doesn't work.

03:40.371 --> 03:42.271
Who's Candace?

03:42.306 --> 03:44.173
No idea. You aren't going, Carl?

03:44.208 --> 03:45.441
No.

03:45.476 --> 03:47.276
It costs $27.

03:50.247 --> 03:51.481
Here.

03:51.515 --> 03:52.749
Awesome!

03:55.052 --> 03:56.085
Thanks.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.187
What?

03:58.222 --> 04:01.290
Well, he really wanted to
go, he knows we're strapped.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.960
This should hold
him for a few hours.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.261
You're gonna need new diapers.

04:08.065 --> 04:09.932
Steve got a text from Candace.

04:09.967 --> 04:11.634
"Sweetie, call me.
It's important."

04:11.668 --> 04:15.204
Hey, you don't read
other people's messages.

04:15.239 --> 04:18.241
Is he dating someone else?

04:18.274 --> 04:20.142
Go! You're gonna be late
for school.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.677
Latey school.

04:21.712 --> 04:22.645
School.

04:25.816 --> 04:27.784
Mommy?

04:29.653 --> 04:32.855
Mommy, I'm hungry, Mommy.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.524
I want some food, Mommy.

04:34.558 --> 04:36.392
Wake up.

04:36.427 --> 04:38.995
Mommy? Kev, we're only taking in

04:39.029 --> 04:41.330
a foster kid for a
week to get the money

04:41.365 --> 04:42.999
to pay for my stupid
parking tickets.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.767
That's it. We're
like a hotel.

04:44.802 --> 04:46.002
Yeah, I know, but...

04:46.036 --> 04:48.337
I'm secretly hoping
you like it,

04:48.372 --> 04:50.473
so we get
to keep the kid longer,

04:50.507 --> 04:52.275
'cause I want to do dad things.

04:52.309 --> 04:53.743
Not a secret anymore.

04:53.777 --> 04:56.078
And it's gonna change
our lives too much.

04:56.113 --> 04:59.081
No, it won't.

04:59.116 --> 05:01.751
Come on. We walk around the
house naked half the time,

05:01.785 --> 05:04.320
shoot tequila for breakfast
and swear up a storm.

05:04.354 --> 05:06.989
You think we're gonna be able
to do that with a kid around?

05:07.024 --> 05:08.825
Yeah, but who cares?
You know what?

05:08.859 --> 05:10.960
I lived with some crazy ass
foster parents,

05:10.994 --> 05:13.830
but it's better than being
brought up in a group home.

05:13.864 --> 05:15.498
Well, just don't
get too excited.

05:15.532 --> 05:16.799
We're gonna get our money

05:16.834 --> 05:19.335
and kick the little
brat to the curb.

05:19.369 --> 05:20.770
All right, fine.

05:20.804 --> 05:23.339
Now come here and let me suckle
your little teat, Mommy.

05:23.373 --> 05:24.507
Uh-uh.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.442
Come on, let me suckle yo' teat.
Uh-uh!

05:26.477 --> 05:27.710
I need some milk.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.145
I need some breakfast.

05:41.425 --> 05:43.726
Which do you like better?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.628
One?

05:45.662 --> 05:46.963
Mmm.

05:46.997 --> 05:48.931
Or two?

05:48.966 --> 05:51.100
Mmm. One.

05:51.134 --> 05:52.935
What about one?

05:52.970 --> 05:54.737
Mm-hmm.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.906
Or two?

05:56.940 --> 05:59.375
Mm, definitely two.

05:59.409 --> 06:01.711
Okay, one?

06:01.745 --> 06:03.579
Oh, God, one. One.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.548
One, one.
I'm not finished yet.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.250
One?

06:07.284 --> 06:09.051
Mmm. Mmm.

06:09.086 --> 06:11.654
Or two?
Oh, God, one!

06:11.688 --> 06:13.689
Who the fuck is Candace? Who?!

06:13.724 --> 06:15.858
Yeah, that's what I'm asking you.
How do you know about Candace?

06:15.893 --> 06:16.993
Oh, so there's
something to know?

06:17.027 --> 06:19.262
We... She... We work together.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.830
Uh-huh. Why is she texting you?

06:20.864 --> 06:22.431
"Hey, sweetie, it's
important. Call me."

06:22.466 --> 06:24.567
Uh, she's a little
high maintenance.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.136
That happens when
you fuck someone.

06:29.072 --> 06:31.607
Believe me, I
didn't fuck Candace.

06:31.642 --> 06:32.942
We work together.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.977
That's all.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.917
I don't care if you
screw someone else.

06:40.951 --> 06:43.352
Just don't lie
about it. Ever.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.475
I'll turn it off.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.311
Shit.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.613
What?
I got to leave.

07:11.615 --> 07:13.082
Are you kidding me?

07:13.116 --> 07:14.483
It's-It's a work thing.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.519
Um, I'll make it up to you.

07:16.553 --> 07:18.888
Sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, ok?

07:18.922 --> 07:20.890
I'll make it up to you tonight.

07:24.761 --> 07:26.696
I don't think
he's gonna wake up.

07:28.165 --> 07:29.599
Mr. Gallagher?

07:29.633 --> 07:32.568
Mr. Gallagher?

07:33.637 --> 07:35.237
What the bejeezus?!

07:35.272 --> 07:37.306
Sorry. We tried
smelling salts,

07:37.341 --> 07:39.075
caffeine injections, ice baths.

07:39.109 --> 07:40.209
Where am I?

07:40.243 --> 07:41.644
In the hospital.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.613
You've been unconscious
for two days

07:43.647 --> 07:44.780
with alcohol poisoning.

07:44.815 --> 07:45.982
Oh, that's-that's nothing.

07:46.016 --> 07:48.084
Back in '95,
I was out for eight days.

07:49.319 --> 07:50.920
Wait, wait.
Hold on on second.

07:50.954 --> 07:53.956
I'm Dr. Seery.
These are my residents.

07:53.991 --> 07:56.425
We have a proposition for you.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.961
Well, you're hot, but it's been
a while since I've been

07:58.996 --> 08:00.763
with a dude, never mind two.

08:00.797 --> 08:03.265
Oh, you've-you've misunderstood.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.901
Uh, we'd like you to participate
in our medical study.

08:05.936 --> 08:07.103
Your what?

08:07.137 --> 08:08.971
In my whole career,
I've never seen

08:09.006 --> 08:11.474
such a spectacular display
of alcoholism.

08:11.508 --> 08:13.242
Thank you.

08:13.276 --> 08:15.378
Would you be able to abstain
from alcohol for two weeks?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.412
No.

08:16.446 --> 08:18.047
We could offer you $3,000.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.416
- Yes.
- <i>I was like, "Girl,</i>

08:20.450 --> 08:23.919
you are not using my eyeliner
if you have pinkeye."

08:23.954 --> 08:26.722
And she was, like, "Well, then,
you're not my friend anymore."

08:26.757 --> 08:28.758
Hmm?

08:28.792 --> 08:30.593
You're not listening, are you?

08:30.627 --> 08:32.561
No. Sorry.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.996
What's wrong with you?

08:35.032 --> 08:37.299
I slept with someone, not Kash.

08:37.333 --> 08:38.868
What?!
Yeah.

08:38.902 --> 08:41.070
Well, deets, please. Who?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.972
I can't tell you.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.109
He's on the down low, you know?

08:47.144 --> 08:48.577
Wow.

08:48.612 --> 08:50.613
Yeah.

08:57.521 --> 08:59.288
What are you doing?

08:59.322 --> 09:01.757
Hiding our silver,
in case they send us a thief.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.993
We have three settings,
none of 'em even match.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.494
They were my Aunt Elva's.
Hey, check this out.

09:05.529 --> 09:08.164
Found my old football one
of my foster dads left me.

09:08.198 --> 09:09.532
What if it's a girl?

09:09.566 --> 09:11.534
Then she's gonna learn
some kick ass moves.

09:11.568 --> 09:14.437
Kev Ball fakes left, spins
right. He's at the 30.

09:14.471 --> 09:18.140
The 20. The ten. Touchdown!

09:18.175 --> 09:21.110
Hello. I'm sorry.

09:22.512 --> 09:24.213
I'm Mrs. Martini
from the DCFS.

09:24.247 --> 09:25.548
Oh.

09:25.582 --> 09:27.183
I'm Veronica.
This is my husband Kevin.

09:27.217 --> 09:29.385
Hey. Hi. Nice to meet you.

09:29.419 --> 09:32.088
Thank you for being available
on such short notice.

09:32.122 --> 09:33.656
Uh, this is Ethel.

09:39.563 --> 09:42.231
Wow. Okay. Hi.

09:42.265 --> 09:44.300
Ethel and 70 other children were

09:44.334 --> 09:45.201
removed from

09:45.235 --> 09:46.669
a religious sect.

09:46.703 --> 09:48.137
Religious sect?

09:48.171 --> 09:49.572
You mean, like a cult?

09:51.742 --> 09:53.809
Say hello to your new
foster family, Ethel.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.111
Hello.

09:58.381 --> 10:00.816
You'll come back every three
days for a drug screening

10:00.851 --> 10:02.084
and brain scan.

10:02.119 --> 10:04.153
In addition,
you'll be wearing my RAM.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.655
Remote Alcohol Monitor.
Designed it myself.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.992
This fine piece of jewelry will
alert us to any alcohol use.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.994
Make it the whole two weeks,
you get the cash.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.263
Can I get an advance?

10:14.297 --> 10:17.066
This green light is connected
to your bracelet.

10:17.100 --> 10:18.567
Drink one sip of
booze, light turns red.

10:18.602 --> 10:21.337
Attempt to take the bracelet
off, light turns red.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.906
Spill rubbing alcohol on it,
light turns red.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.441
Red light equals no cash.

10:25.475 --> 10:29.578
Get ready to say good-bye
to three grand.

10:31.748 --> 10:34.016
I'm a sober man!

10:35.285 --> 10:36.786
Usual, Frank?

10:36.820 --> 10:38.087
Didn't you hear me, Jess?

10:38.121 --> 10:39.588
I'm sober now.

10:39.623 --> 10:41.257
Here you go.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.092
JB and an Old Style.
Whoa. Whoa.

10:43.126 --> 10:46.061
I'm sober as a seven-year-old.
Haven't had a drink in two days.

10:47.464 --> 10:48.864
Well, granted,
I've been unconscious

10:48.899 --> 10:50.699
for most of it, but I figure,

10:50.734 --> 10:52.501
if I can abstain from alcohol
when I'm out,

10:52.536 --> 10:54.570
how hard can it be to do
when I'm awake?

10:54.604 --> 10:55.704
What are you talking about?

10:55.739 --> 10:56.906
Medical study.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.375
For the next two weeks,
my body is a temple.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.709
No alcohol for this fella.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.945
And I got this little guy
to keep my honest.

11:02.979 --> 11:04.980
Hey, Lindsay Lohan,
how much are they paying you?

11:05.015 --> 11:06.816
Well, who says I'm getting paid?

11:06.850 --> 11:07.983
No, seriously, how much?

11:08.018 --> 11:09.652
Never you mind what I'm making.

11:09.686 --> 11:12.721
You should spend some time
taking a personal inventory

11:12.756 --> 11:14.824
of what you're doing
for the betterment of society.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.392
Why are you in a bar,

11:16.426 --> 11:17.493
Frank, if you're not drinking?

11:17.527 --> 11:20.129
Came in for some support.

11:20.163 --> 11:21.964
The way I see it,
I've done a lot

11:21.998 --> 11:24.166
for the folks around here
over the past couple of years,

11:24.201 --> 11:28.137
and I could use a little help
from you all now.

11:28.171 --> 11:30.739
I might hit some rough patches
over the next few weeks,

11:30.774 --> 11:35.477
so I'd like you all
to commit to not drinking, too,

11:35.512 --> 11:36.612
in solidarity.

11:36.646 --> 11:37.947
Like schoolchildren,

11:37.981 --> 11:40.182
when they shave their head
for the cancer kid.

11:40.217 --> 11:41.350
So what say you all?

11:41.384 --> 11:43.986
Who's ready to put down
the booze with me

11:44.020 --> 11:46.355
for the next two weeks?!

12:01.071 --> 12:02.504
Fine.

12:04.841 --> 12:07.209
Hope you all get AIDS.

12:13.683 --> 12:14.950
Thanks.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.218
Hi, girl.

12:16.253 --> 12:18.087
Here for your check?
Yeah.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.855
Hi, Liam. Thanks, Gisela.

12:19.890 --> 12:23.726
Fiona... I can't find it.
What job did you do?

12:23.760 --> 12:24.860
Auto show last week.

12:24.895 --> 12:26.528
Ah, shit.
What?

12:26.563 --> 12:28.330
Jackasses at
McCormick Place handed in

12:28.365 --> 12:29.398
the time cards late.

12:29.432 --> 12:32.167
Checks won't be in
till next Friday.

12:32.202 --> 12:34.069
Are you serious?
Sorry about that.

12:34.104 --> 12:35.504
Can I go pick it up?

12:35.538 --> 12:37.339
Payroll doesn't
release funds early.

12:37.374 --> 12:39.975
I won't make it till next week.

12:40.010 --> 12:40.976
Sticks and Skates Sports Bar

12:41.011 --> 12:42.344
may need someone
for this weekend.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.346
They still make you
wear those uniforms?

12:44.381 --> 12:45.414
Yeah.

12:45.448 --> 12:46.849
Might as well put
a mirrored stage

12:46.883 --> 12:48.550
and a stripper pole
in that place.

12:48.585 --> 12:50.319
I'm teaching a free
PowerPoint class

12:50.353 --> 12:52.354
for the next four Saturdays.

12:52.389 --> 12:54.723
Could get you an office job
once you're certified.

12:54.758 --> 12:56.992
Starting pay is $20 an hour.

13:00.430 --> 13:03.265
Hey, Sheila, Karen already
leave for school?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.000
No. Have you seen Frank?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.502
What, he hasn't been here?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.804
Not in a few days.
I'm rather worried about him.

13:08.838 --> 13:10.472
I'm sure he's just on a bender.

13:10.507 --> 13:11.974
He'll surface.
Yeah.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.842
What are you doing here?

13:13.877 --> 13:15.878
The SAT guy that popped me...

13:15.912 --> 13:18.247
dragging my ass out
to the University of Chicago.

13:18.281 --> 13:20.649
You're planning on
going to college?

13:20.684 --> 13:23.085
Fuck, no. I thought
we'd check it out though,

13:23.119 --> 13:26.322
you know, maybe steal some
sweatshirts from the bookstore.

13:26.356 --> 13:28.557
Okay.

13:31.828 --> 13:35.564
Hey, Ethel, Veronica's setting up a
space for you in the living room.

13:35.598 --> 13:37.599
In the meantime,
pick your poison.

13:37.634 --> 13:39.234
Parcheesi?
Monopoly?

13:39.269 --> 13:40.669
Clue? No? Yes? Maybe?

13:40.704 --> 13:42.404
You want to go over
to the park?

13:42.439 --> 13:43.739
Throw the old pigskin around?

13:43.773 --> 13:45.741
I haven't done my chores today.

13:45.775 --> 13:46.875
<i>Como se</i> huh?

13:46.910 --> 13:49.278
My chores. Don't you have
any for me to do?

13:49.312 --> 13:50.512
No. Like what?

13:50.547 --> 13:53.382
Scrubbing floors.
Washing dishes.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.218
Hemming. Pickling.
Canning.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.187
Laundry.

13:58.221 --> 14:00.022
Let's go grab a burger.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.091
There's a new kids' place
where all the waiters

14:02.125 --> 14:03.525
dress like famous
Chicago gangsters.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.895
Although I have no idea what
that has to do with kids

14:06.930 --> 14:07.997
or burgers.

14:08.031 --> 14:09.098
What?

14:09.132 --> 14:13.569
The Bible says that chores
keep the soul pure.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.636
It does?

14:15.905 --> 14:20.209
All right, let's go find
you some chores to do.

14:26.316 --> 14:27.816
Sorry we can't fool around.

14:27.851 --> 14:31.320
It's cool. I get it.

14:31.354 --> 14:33.255
A woman's fertile
for five days.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.224
Linda looked it up online.

14:35.258 --> 14:36.992
Oh, yeah?

14:37.027 --> 14:38.927
Is everything okay with you?

14:40.430 --> 14:41.497
Totally.

14:44.401 --> 14:46.101
It's her.

14:49.672 --> 14:50.773
She's ripe.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.008
I got to go.

14:53.043 --> 14:56.111
I guess I'll see you later?

14:56.146 --> 14:57.679
Yeah.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.095
Mother!

15:14.864 --> 15:16.165
Frank!

15:16.199 --> 15:17.466
Oh!

15:17.500 --> 15:18.634
Frank!

15:18.668 --> 15:20.335
Frank!

15:20.370 --> 15:22.805
Oh, I am worried about you.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.840
Where have you been?
Are you all right?

15:24.874 --> 15:25.974
No, I'm not all right.
No?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.509
I've got to stay sober
for two weeks.

15:27.544 --> 15:28.811
I'm not gonna make it.

15:28.845 --> 15:31.647
Do we have cigarettes?
I really need a cigarette.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.783
Frank, I'm...
I'm so proud of you.

15:34.818 --> 15:36.485
Don't be proud.
It's only been an hour.

15:36.519 --> 15:37.653
Oh!
You gotta help me.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.555
Keep me busy. Entertain me.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.384
Professor.
Oh.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.952
SAT's a side gig.

16:43.987 --> 16:45.187
Pays for my boat.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.222
Which gets you laid,
I'm guessing.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.958
No, the beard gets me laid.
Chicks dig a beard.

16:49.993 --> 16:51.760
I'll keep that in mind.

16:51.794 --> 16:53.462
You planning on
going to college?

16:55.265 --> 16:58.500
You know, Professor Hurst
thinks Lip's a genius.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.569
I think he is, too.

17:00.603 --> 17:04.006
That's cute.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.308
I'd like you to attend the
university next semester.

17:06.342 --> 17:09.211
I can't. I still have a year
and a half of high school left.

17:09.244 --> 17:11.780
Well, test out.
You know you're capable.

17:11.814 --> 17:13.348
And pay for it with what?

17:13.383 --> 17:14.750
Beard get me money, too?

17:14.784 --> 17:16.551
There's grants
you can apply for.

17:16.586 --> 17:18.319
There's loans that will
pay for the school

17:18.354 --> 17:20.088
and the dorm
and your meal card.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.558
And then I end up owing like
a half million bucks, right?

17:22.592 --> 17:24.259
Well, you're a clever kid.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.295
You'll figure out a way
to stiff Uncle Sam.

17:26.329 --> 17:28.997
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of trouble to me.

17:29.032 --> 17:31.266
Well, it's better
than the alternative.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.136
And what's that?
Well...

17:34.170 --> 17:36.238
That girl that you're with...

17:36.272 --> 17:37.639
Uh-huh.

17:37.674 --> 17:40.342
...you'll knock her up,
or someone like her.

17:40.376 --> 17:42.044
And she'll say it
happened accidentally.

17:42.078 --> 17:45.113
But you'll always wonder if it
happened accidentally on purpose.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.051
You'll get a job at Best Buy.

17:49.085 --> 17:50.419
And with luck,

17:50.453 --> 17:53.322
you'll make assistant manager
by the time you're 30.

17:53.356 --> 17:55.557
Unless, of course, the
anger that you've suppressed

17:55.592 --> 17:58.193
finally bubbles over and you
mouth off to the wrong person

17:58.228 --> 17:59.895
and you get your ass fired.

17:59.929 --> 18:02.731
And from that point on, you won't
be able to hold a job very long

18:02.765 --> 18:04.066
because you'll know the truth.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.400
And what's that?

18:05.435 --> 18:09.838
That you never lived
up to your potential.

18:09.872 --> 18:12.574
And the only way to numb
the pain of underachieving

18:12.609 --> 18:15.410
is with booze and with meth.

18:15.445 --> 18:18.146
The old philosophical-professor...

18:18.181 --> 18:21.049
who's-gonna-set-the-troubled-
teen-on-the-right-track?

18:21.084 --> 18:23.285
It's a little trite,
don't you think?

18:23.319 --> 18:25.220
Oh...

18:25.255 --> 18:28.390
I mean, how many of us has
that actually worked on?

18:28.424 --> 18:29.992
Not enough.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.727
There's no shortage of brilliant
kids just like yourself

18:31.761 --> 18:33.595
who are too stupid to
get out of the 'hood.

18:33.630 --> 18:36.298
And how do we usually respond?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.399
You tell me to fuck off.

18:37.433 --> 18:41.169
Well, I guess you
saved me the trouble.

18:41.204 --> 18:42.771
Actually, no. Fuck off.

18:42.805 --> 18:44.306
Listen, I've got a class.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.074
Why don't you take a
peek inside here

18:46.109 --> 18:48.210
before you go?

18:48.244 --> 18:49.811
This is the robotics lab.

18:49.846 --> 18:51.647
It is the best in the country.

18:51.681 --> 18:56.218
Just, uh, poke around.
Come by anytime.

18:56.252 --> 18:58.620
Wear a condom, Phillip.

19:12.702 --> 19:14.436
Got any 8's?

19:14.470 --> 19:17.439
Go fish.

19:19.275 --> 19:21.643
How about 4's?
Got any 4's?

19:22.679 --> 19:24.246
Shit,

19:24.280 --> 19:26.515
it's only been 90 minutes.

19:26.549 --> 19:27.783
You want some more coffee?

19:27.817 --> 19:28.817
Uh-uh.

19:28.851 --> 19:30.952
I'm crawling out of my skin.

19:30.987 --> 19:34.156
Well, I know another
thing that might

19:34.190 --> 19:35.390
kill some time.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.458
No.

19:36.492 --> 19:38.060
No. Have mercy on me.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.495
I can't handle anything
up my ass without alcohol.

19:40.530 --> 19:45.100
Listen, we'll make it
all be about you, okay?

19:46.302 --> 19:47.736
Come on.

19:51.407 --> 19:54.543
Come on, sweetie.

19:59.215 --> 20:02.150
Got any Slim Js
in this shit hole?

20:09.425 --> 20:11.493
Yeah, in the back room.

20:19.202 --> 20:20.802
Sure we can't help, Ethel?

20:20.837 --> 20:22.337
Hey, don't kick me

20:22.372 --> 20:24.039
'cause you don't want to clean.

20:24.073 --> 20:26.541
The carpet is fine. I swiffered last week.
I just feel icky about this.

20:26.576 --> 20:28.510
I mean, we're supposed to be
taking care of her.

20:28.544 --> 20:30.245
Not taking advantage of her.

20:30.279 --> 20:32.714
You said it makes her happy when she cleans.
She's not our slave, V.

20:32.749 --> 20:34.015
Do you see her picking cotton?

20:34.050 --> 20:35.484
All finished.

20:35.518 --> 20:37.619
Can I help you with
your chores now, Veronica?

20:38.788 --> 20:40.689
At my house, all
the wives split the chores.

20:42.892 --> 20:44.493
All the wives?

20:44.527 --> 20:45.994
You're one of five wives?

20:46.028 --> 20:47.562
Married to a dude named Clyde?

20:47.597 --> 20:49.030
Who's 65 years old?

20:49.065 --> 20:50.365
And how old are you?

20:50.400 --> 20:51.767
13.

20:51.801 --> 20:54.302
Oh, my...

20:54.337 --> 20:56.271
I'm gonna bust your ass.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.343
What's the total right now?

21:01.377 --> 21:03.612
Um, $7.56.

21:04.747 --> 21:05.747
Okay.

21:05.782 --> 21:06.782
Okay keep going,

21:06.816 --> 21:08.083

21:09.719 --> 21:11.119

21:12.922 --> 21:15.290
Excuse me.
Where's the bathroom?

21:15.324 --> 21:18.427
Uh, door to the left of the butcher.
Thanks.

21:18.461 --> 21:19.394
Okay, baby, we're going.

21:19.429 --> 21:22.397
Okay, your total
is $18.72.

21:22.432 --> 21:25.434
Don't worry, honey, Mama's gonna
change your diaper now.

21:25.468 --> 21:27.602

21:32.408 --> 21:35.076
Oh, damn, did
I forget your diapers?

21:35.111 --> 21:36.978

Sheils?

22:28.798 --> 22:31.132
You're not putting an IV in it.

22:36.405 --> 22:38.340
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

22:39.976 --> 22:41.443
It looks like a gummy worm.

22:41.477 --> 22:44.045
I'm going for a jog.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.115
Well, that's a nice idea, too.

22:48.484 --> 22:50.752
Doing great, Frank.
Doing great.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.554
Everything's fine.
You're gonna make it.

22:52.588 --> 22:55.957
Oh! Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

22:55.992 --> 23:00.662
It's been, uh, oh, 37 years
since my last confession.

23:00.696 --> 23:06.134
♪ America, America,
God shed his grace on thee. ♪

23:06.168 --> 23:10.138
Mars, Venus, Earth, Mercury,

23:10.172 --> 23:13.341
Jupiter... Martians...

23:13.376 --> 23:14.976
Pluto, Pluto... Pluto?

23:15.011 --> 23:17.779
It's not even
a goddamn planet anymore!

23:17.813 --> 23:18.813
It got demoted...

23:18.848 --> 23:20.382
just like St. Christopher.

23:20.416 --> 23:23.718
Oh, God!

23:23.753 --> 23:25.554
Daddy?

23:25.588 --> 23:27.489
Debbie, what are you doing here?

23:27.523 --> 23:30.025
This is where
I play after school.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.229
It is?

23:34.263 --> 23:35.363
You okay, Daddy?

23:35.398 --> 23:37.332
Gave up the booze.
Not feeling too good.

23:37.366 --> 23:39.501
Want some Hawaiian Punch?

23:44.707 --> 23:46.374
Mmm... Mmm!

23:46.409 --> 23:48.143
So good.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.744
Why's it so good?

23:49.779 --> 23:52.080
It's all sugar.

23:53.382 --> 23:55.984
Can we get more of this?

23:56.018 --> 23:58.019
Mmm...

24:05.861 --> 24:07.495
This is nice, isn't it, Deb,

24:07.530 --> 24:09.097
the two of just hanging out,

24:09.131 --> 24:11.433
getting to know each other?
Yeah.

24:11.467 --> 24:14.202
Why don't we do this more often?

24:14.236 --> 24:15.837
We should do this more often.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.772
Want to snort the next batch?

24:17.807 --> 24:18.840
No.

24:22.812 --> 24:25.213
What are we doing here?

24:25.247 --> 24:27.215
Seriously?
From, uh, my vantage point,

24:27.249 --> 24:29.584
it looks like we're on
the verge of fucking.

24:29.619 --> 24:31.386
No, I mean, you and me.
What are we?

24:31.420 --> 24:33.288
What we've always been; friends.

24:33.322 --> 24:34.856
Just friends?

24:34.890 --> 24:37.892
Yeah, you know...

24:37.927 --> 24:39.894
friends who like to do this.

24:39.929 --> 24:40.929
Right?

24:40.963 --> 24:42.497
Right. I knew that.

24:43.532 --> 24:45.533
I was just checking.

24:45.568 --> 24:46.968
Oh, fuck.

24:48.337 --> 24:50.338
You have a bedroom, Lip.

24:50.373 --> 24:52.040
Yeah, says the girl
who had sex on

24:52.074 --> 24:53.108
the stairs last night.

24:53.142 --> 24:54.075
Hallway.

24:54.110 --> 24:55.443
I stand corrected.

24:55.478 --> 24:58.313
Kev and V are on their way over
with meat sauce.

24:58.347 --> 24:59.881
Is that a euphemism?

24:59.915 --> 25:01.049
I bought pasta.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.951
They're bringing
their foster kid over

25:02.985 --> 25:04.085
to play with Debs.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.620
Paintball rocks!

25:05.655 --> 25:08.657
I had the best day of my life.

25:08.691 --> 25:09.824
Did you wear a face guard?

25:09.859 --> 25:11.326
Nope.

25:11.360 --> 25:15.330
Hey, hey! I want you guys
to meet our new daughter.

25:15.364 --> 25:16.931
Foster daughter.

25:16.966 --> 25:18.199
Why you got to do that?

25:18.234 --> 25:20.035
Let me help you with that.

25:20.069 --> 25:21.736
You weren't kidding about her.

25:21.771 --> 25:22.804
I know.

25:22.838 --> 25:24.806
Hi, I'm Karen.
Nice to meet you.

25:24.840 --> 25:27.509
Oh, right, 'cause it's
18th-century England.

25:27.543 --> 25:29.544
Frankie's home!

25:33.182 --> 25:34.916
Oh, my God, I am so wired.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.951
Debs, what's going on?

25:36.986 --> 25:39.120
We got high on sugar,
because Daddy quit drinking.

25:39.155 --> 25:40.288
Whose daddy?

25:40.322 --> 25:42.691
Me daddy. Me, me, me-me-me-me.

25:43.826 --> 25:44.826
Shit.

25:44.860 --> 25:45.994
What?

25:46.028 --> 25:47.362
He's done this once before.

25:47.396 --> 25:49.497
We gotta help Daddy
stay busy and keep

25:49.532 --> 25:52.500
his mind off of drinking,
so he can make $3,000.

25:52.535 --> 25:55.103
Hey, everybody,
come here. Gather round.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.172
I've got something
I want to say.

25:57.206 --> 25:58.273
Um, I know

25:58.307 --> 26:01.876
I haven't been the most
exemplary father

26:01.911 --> 26:04.779
for the past three or 15 years.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.315
But now I'm gonna need
your help to get through this.

26:07.349 --> 26:09.417
From this point forward,

26:09.452 --> 26:11.653
we're going
to be a family again.

26:11.687 --> 26:13.288
What the hell is that?

26:14.990 --> 26:17.158
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

26:32.908 --> 26:36.144
Spin, Ethel, two times!

26:36.178 --> 26:40.148
You only spun... you only
spun her two times!

26:40.182 --> 26:41.316
Here comes Carl!

26:43.052 --> 26:45.320

27:23.859 --> 27:25.026
What difference does it make?

27:25.060 --> 27:26.327
He'll be drinking again
by tomorrow, anyway.

27:26.362 --> 27:30.565
No, not when money's involved.

27:30.599 --> 27:32.534
Dang, what's wrong with
cranky pants tonight?

27:36.172 --> 27:38.473
"Got caught up with something.
Check in with you tomorrow."

27:38.507 --> 27:39.507
That from Steve?

27:39.542 --> 27:41.176
Yeah. He was
acting weird

27:41.210 --> 27:43.311
this morning
after "Candace" texted him.

27:43.345 --> 27:44.579
Said he works with her.

27:44.613 --> 27:47.382
Don't know if I believe him.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.287
Okay, any requests?

27:52.321 --> 27:55.190
"Carry Me Home on the Cross?"

27:59.762 --> 28:01.396
Thanks for bringing dinner.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.463
You supplied the spaghetti.

28:02.498 --> 28:03.464
Yeah, with no sauce.

28:03.499 --> 28:05.133
I'm hanging by a thread.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.635
You're talking to someone
who's renting a kid for money.

28:07.670 --> 28:09.838
I gotta find something
more permanent.

28:09.872 --> 28:11.940
Like what?

28:11.974 --> 28:14.375
Could take a PowerPoint class.

28:14.410 --> 28:16.211
Or Sticks and Skates
may be hiring.

28:16.245 --> 28:17.946
You mean, Dicks and Dates?

28:17.980 --> 28:21.916
Maybe Frank will stay
sober and get the cash.

28:21.951 --> 28:25.053
Maybe I'll win the lottery.

28:25.087 --> 28:26.621
Hey, you think Steve's lying?

28:26.655 --> 28:28.156
Probably.

28:28.190 --> 28:31.226
If I find out he is,
I'm done with him.

28:31.260 --> 28:32.727
Done with who?

28:32.761 --> 28:33.995
Steve. He's getting text
messages

28:34.029 --> 28:35.129
from some bitch named Candace.

28:35.164 --> 28:36.464
Candace?

28:36.498 --> 28:38.399
Uh-oh, that sounds like a woman
you have an affair with.

28:38.434 --> 28:39.868
It does?
It does?

28:39.902 --> 28:42.270
No! Please, that fool doesn't
have enough game to cheat.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.272
Did you ask him if he was?

28:44.306 --> 28:45.874
Yeah. He said he wasn't.

28:45.908 --> 28:48.176
Well, then you have two
choices: believe him or don't.

28:48.210 --> 28:50.111
Or you could let
your suspicions grow

28:50.145 --> 28:51.512
until you turn into

28:51.547 --> 28:54.682
the ice queen and act
like he's invisible

28:54.717 --> 28:56.484
until he starts sending
anonymous threatening notes,

28:56.518 --> 28:59.087
and you have
to report his ass to the po-po.

28:59.121 --> 29:01.289
Who was that? Brian?

29:01.323 --> 29:03.458
Brian, Joey, Michael.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.093
You know, Fi, every guy
you've been with,

29:05.127 --> 29:06.294
you cut and run.

29:06.328 --> 29:07.795
Maybe it's time you tried
something new.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.932
Damn, baby, that was good!

29:10.966 --> 29:13.401
Being a dad brings out the best in me.
You're not a dad.

29:13.435 --> 29:15.937
We got a football game
starting out on the street.

29:15.971 --> 29:16.571
Shirts against skins.

29:16.605 --> 29:17.772
Sweet.

29:17.806 --> 29:19.908
Uh, you two are skins.

29:21.911 --> 29:24.646
I have no idea what PowerPoint
is, but you're smart.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.815
I know you're gonna
be great at it.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.544
Hello?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.318
Anybody here?

30:03.352 --> 30:05.553
I'm home.

30:05.587 --> 30:07.422
Hey, there he is.

30:07.456 --> 30:08.823
Little brother!

30:08.857 --> 30:10.124
Flight from Detroit okay?

30:10.159 --> 30:12.460
Yeah, yeah, fine.
Yeah?

30:12.494 --> 30:14.095
How's school?
Ah, piece of cake so far.

30:14.129 --> 30:16.197
Well, that's what you get for going
to Michigan instead of Harvard.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.966
Oh! You set me up
for that, huh?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.635
Huh? Huh? You didn't
see that coming.

30:20.669 --> 30:22.804
Sorry to drag you back
to Chicago for all this.

30:22.838 --> 30:24.572
Nah. How's the practice?
Busy.

30:24.606 --> 30:26.607
Thank God for fast food
and stress.

30:26.642 --> 30:29.177
It's like a platinum Amex
for cardiologists.

30:29.211 --> 30:30.912
Hey, you.
Hey.

30:30.946 --> 30:32.480
I missed you.

30:32.514 --> 30:33.715
Mmm. Thanks!

30:33.749 --> 30:35.917
We're all in
the kitchen having tea.

30:35.951 --> 30:38.152
Yeah, I'll be right there.

30:38.187 --> 30:40.221
I'll tell your mother.

30:45.227 --> 30:46.594
I mean, I got three
fucking kids at home,

30:46.628 --> 30:48.529
and you're going
balls-deep in that?

30:48.564 --> 30:51.466
Fucking killing me, Jimmy.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.134
Welcome home.

30:55.137 --> 30:57.939
First pub crawl I did was
when I was 16.

30:57.973 --> 31:00.842
Hit 22 pubs before I hurled.

31:00.876 --> 31:02.477
Got right back on the horse.

31:02.511 --> 31:03.911
Hit ten more. Hurled again.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.381
That's how I got the nickname
"Boot and Rally."

31:06.415 --> 31:07.615
Cool!

31:07.649 --> 31:09.250
Anyone seen the laptop?

31:09.284 --> 31:11.386
What's going on in here?

31:11.420 --> 31:13.254
Daddy made us
Mickey Mouse pancakes.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.455
Are you serious?
Mm-hmm.

31:14.490 --> 31:15.623
What'd I tell you?

31:15.657 --> 31:17.792
Still not drinking
till he gets his money.

31:17.826 --> 31:19.127
If I ever drink again.

31:19.161 --> 31:20.228
Right.

31:20.262 --> 31:21.596
Java's my vice now.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.531
Yeah, well, drunk or sober,
you're still an asshole.

31:23.565 --> 31:24.966
Lip!

31:25.000 --> 31:26.801
It's okay, Deb.
Everybody's got a right to

31:26.835 --> 31:29.771
his opinion. That's what makes
this country of ours so great.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.105
You want orange juice?
Ooh, yeah, yum.

31:31.140 --> 31:33.474
Where'd you get all this stuff
to make breakfast?

31:33.509 --> 31:36.244
Traded some old <i>Hustler</i>
magazines with Rusty the Drunk.

31:36.278 --> 31:37.612
He's working as a dishwasher

31:37.646 --> 31:39.213
at the Denny's over on
West 95th Street.

31:39.248 --> 31:41.916
You want some OJ?
No.

31:41.950 --> 31:43.584
Oh! Found it.
I'm taking this

31:43.619 --> 31:45.086
to the job center
for a few hours.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.287
Yeah, come on, Debs, Carl.
Grab your coats.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.588
Told Kev we'd be over there
in five minutes.

31:47.623 --> 31:49.323
Does that weird girl
have to come with us?

31:49.358 --> 31:51.325
Where you going?
Bowling. Lip knows

31:51.360 --> 31:53.261
a kid who can get us in
for free.

31:53.295 --> 31:55.263
Wanna come?
No, Debs, I don't think he can...

31:55.297 --> 31:58.866
Hey, I'd love to come! Just let
me clean this place up first.

31:58.901 --> 32:00.635
Okay? Excuse me? What?

32:00.669 --> 32:01.803
Clear the table.

32:07.509 --> 32:10.378
Hey, the Gallaghers invited us
to go bowling.

32:10.412 --> 32:11.679
What are you doing?

32:11.713 --> 32:13.281
Veronica asked me
to do her chores.

32:13.315 --> 32:16.050
Said she would help me
with mine next week. No.

32:16.085 --> 32:17.051
What?

32:17.086 --> 32:19.253
Put that down.
Put that down. Look,

32:19.288 --> 32:21.689
I know the Bible says you get
closer to God and crap

32:21.723 --> 32:23.224
if you sew
the holes in my socks,

32:23.258 --> 32:25.760
but this is just wrong.
It's Saturday!

32:25.794 --> 32:27.662
And in my house,
the way to get closer

32:27.696 --> 32:29.097
to God on Saturday is to play.

32:29.131 --> 32:30.765
Is that in Ezekiel?

32:30.799 --> 32:33.401
Yeah, the updated version.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.103
Now go change out
of that Laura Ingalls dress.

32:35.137 --> 32:36.571
Oh, yes, sir.

32:36.605 --> 32:38.973
And don't call me "sir."

32:39.007 --> 32:42.610
We are gonna have <i>so</i> much fun!

32:44.246 --> 32:45.847
Yeah, it's open!

32:47.015 --> 32:49.217
Hey, Ethel, let's
get a move on, huh?

32:49.251 --> 32:50.818
Holy fuck!

32:50.853 --> 32:52.453
I'm ready for you, sir.

32:52.488 --> 32:54.522
What are you doing?
Clyde usually had me on Tuesdays,

32:54.556 --> 32:55.857
but if you want me
on Saturdays...

32:55.891 --> 32:57.125
No, I don't want you
on Saturdays,

32:57.159 --> 32:58.626
I don't want you, ever.

32:58.660 --> 33:00.661
- Hey, Kev, we're all ready to...
- Whoa.

33:01.897 --> 33:03.030
Uh...

33:03.065 --> 33:04.432
No, Lip. Lip, wait!

33:04.466 --> 33:05.967
No, you use "me"

33:06.001 --> 33:08.169
because it's the object
of the preposition.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.872
So it's
"with Max and me?"

33:10.906 --> 33:12.773
Yep.
Sounds weird.

33:12.808 --> 33:14.208
I'm telling you, it's right.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.778
Douchebags.

33:17.813 --> 33:19.080
Assface.

33:25.287 --> 33:27.522
Gotta go to the bathroom.

33:27.556 --> 33:29.190
Hold the handle down
when you flush.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.625
Okay.

33:30.659 --> 33:32.393
Hey.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.362
You want a pizza bagel?

33:34.396 --> 33:36.998
Sure.

33:42.871 --> 33:46.040
Show of hands:
how many of you know Word?

33:47.042 --> 33:50.244
Okay. Microsoft Excel?

33:50.279 --> 33:53.147
All right, let's get started.
Gladys, can you get the lights?

33:53.182 --> 33:56.050
Open up the PowerPoint template,

33:56.084 --> 33:58.219
which can be found
in your Microsoft Suite.

33:58.253 --> 34:02.223
In the dialogue box, enter the
title of your presentation.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.759
Take a moment now to use the
toolbar and experiment

34:04.793 --> 34:08.329
with color, font
and size of your text...

34:10.199 --> 34:13.234
I must warn you,
I have bowled before.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.402
Hey, you want to put
some money on it?

34:15.437 --> 34:17.405
Just for fun.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.581
That's what
I'm talking about, yes!

34:26.614 --> 34:28.416
For you! For you!
I love you! Yeah!

34:28.449 --> 34:30.918
Did you see that? Yeah! Go, Dad!

34:30.953 --> 34:34.522
Ho, I'm hot, ho, ho.
Look out.

34:34.556 --> 34:37.592
Guys, don't... get too
used to this, okay?

34:37.626 --> 34:38.926
What?

34:38.960 --> 34:41.429
Well, Dad's not always
going to be so nice.

34:41.463 --> 34:42.929
Yes, he will.

34:42.965 --> 34:45.433
No. Not when he starts
drinking again, okay?

34:45.467 --> 34:46.967
He'll go back to his old ways

34:47.002 --> 34:48.536
and I don't want
you two getting hurt.

34:48.570 --> 34:50.071
Hurt?

34:50.105 --> 34:51.606
All right, Deb,
here's the spare!

34:51.639 --> 34:53.206
Yeah!

34:53.242 --> 34:55.743
Um, remember that turtle
you had last summer?

34:55.777 --> 34:57.078
Walter?

34:57.112 --> 34:58.713
Yeah, yeah.
Walter.

34:58.747 --> 35:01.415
And you guys were really, really
into him for like, two weeks.

35:01.450 --> 35:02.984
And you talked to him,

35:03.018 --> 35:05.219
and you fed him.

35:05.254 --> 35:07.755
And you took him
everywhere with you, right?

35:07.789 --> 35:10.324
But after a while,

35:10.359 --> 35:13.894
you know, you guys got busy
with other things.

35:13.929 --> 35:16.163
So... Walter's water
never got changed,

35:16.198 --> 35:18.332
and nobody fed him.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.801
And like two months later,

35:20.836 --> 35:25.072
Debs, you wanted to show off
Walter to your friend Susie.

35:25.107 --> 35:27.642
And you guys started looking
for him, and when you found him,

35:27.676 --> 35:30.478
he was all dried up and dead.

35:30.512 --> 35:32.480
Now...

35:32.514 --> 35:35.516
see, you guys
are that turtle, okay?

35:35.550 --> 35:37.585
And Dad's you.

35:37.619 --> 35:40.321
You get what I'm saying?

35:42.024 --> 35:44.058
Dad's buying us another turtle?

35:44.092 --> 35:47.094
No.

35:47.129 --> 35:51.198
Uh, no, forget it.
Never mind.

35:52.834 --> 35:55.536
Don't worry, Lip.
I get it.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.971
Daddy's going to
forget all about us

35:57.005 --> 35:58.072
when he starts drinking again.

35:58.106 --> 35:59.640
It's okay.
I don't mind.

35:59.675 --> 36:02.476
I'm going to enjoy this
while it lasts,

36:02.511 --> 36:04.178
if that's okay.

36:04.212 --> 36:07.548
Yeah, sure, Debs.
That's, um...

36:07.582 --> 36:10.551
that's a good plan.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.766
Took you long enough.

36:25.801 --> 36:28.536
Yeah. Your dad was
in there forever.

36:32.274 --> 36:35.943
Shove over, faggots.

36:35.977 --> 36:38.946
Watch and learn.

36:51.593 --> 36:56.030
"No worries."

37:06.908 --> 37:10.244
Okay. That's, uh, 36 bucks.

37:10.278 --> 37:11.412
I got it.

37:18.854 --> 37:20.554
Keep the change, darling.

37:20.589 --> 37:22.623
Thanks.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.126
Whoo!

37:39.641 --> 37:42.109
Hey. Sorry
I'm late.

37:42.144 --> 37:43.611
No biggie.

37:46.948 --> 37:47.948
Good news.

37:47.983 --> 37:50.718
Linda's done with
me this month.

37:50.752 --> 37:52.753
Oh, yeah?

37:54.222 --> 37:55.523
Maybe we could, um...

37:55.557 --> 37:59.460
adjust the cameras,
for old time's sake.

38:09.237 --> 38:10.538
<i>"Then I hear it...</i>

38:10.572 --> 38:12.506
"several pairs of feet
breaking into a run.

38:12.541 --> 38:13.908
"The firestarter
must've dozed off.

38:13.942 --> 38:15.976
"They're on her before
she can escape, and I know..."

38:16.011 --> 38:18.245
Any chance of you getting a job,
now that you're sober?

38:18.280 --> 38:19.513
Shh!

38:19.548 --> 38:21.215
We're getting to
the part where Katniss

38:21.249 --> 38:23.551
releases the tracker jackers
that kill Glimmer.

38:23.585 --> 38:25.519
Dinner in the kitchen,
if you want.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.887
"Then there's laughter,

38:26.922 --> 38:28.823
"and congratulations
from several voices.

38:28.857 --> 38:31.058
'Twelve down! Eleven to go!'"

38:52.647 --> 38:54.014
He I'm going out.

38:57.519 --> 38:58.519
What's up?

38:58.553 --> 39:02.056
Hard day.

39:05.527 --> 39:07.995
Why are you so upset with Dad?

39:08.029 --> 39:11.632
Fiona, we, uh... we've been
through this before, remember?

39:11.666 --> 39:14.502
Last time Dad was sober?

39:14.536 --> 39:16.871
Yeah? So?

39:16.905 --> 39:21.408
He, uh, he had a bet
with some guy at the bar,

39:21.443 --> 39:23.077
and became the perfect dad.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.346
I mean, it was the
first time he ever came to

39:25.380 --> 39:26.747
one of my Little League games.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.483
And uh, I hit a double.

39:29.518 --> 39:33.587
I fucking never
saw him so proud.

39:35.190 --> 39:37.825
You knew he was going to go back
to his regular shitty self.

39:37.859 --> 39:41.328
No, that's, uh,
that's the thing.

39:41.363 --> 39:43.697
I didn't know.

40:16.598 --> 40:19.266
Hi.
What are you doing?

40:19.301 --> 40:20.901
Well, I was, uh,
I was going to go back,

40:20.936 --> 40:22.202
check out that lab.
You want to come?

40:22.237 --> 40:25.406
Okay.

40:25.440 --> 40:27.274
Why didn't you just
go to the front door?

40:27.309 --> 40:30.477
This seemed more romantic.

40:30.512 --> 40:32.379
Plus, I didn't know if you were
up there with someone.

40:32.414 --> 40:34.582
Jason snuck out an hour ago.

40:34.616 --> 40:35.816
Jason Pierce?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.718
Maybe.

40:39.788 --> 40:41.722
He just showed me
a Web site to steal music.

40:41.756 --> 40:43.057
I'll be right down.

40:43.091 --> 40:44.725
All right.

40:52.667 --> 40:55.002
I'm not even in the mood, V.

40:55.036 --> 40:56.070
What's up?

40:56.104 --> 40:57.404
You know what's up.

40:57.439 --> 40:58.806
Is this about the kid?

40:58.840 --> 40:59.773
Yeah.

40:59.808 --> 41:00.774
What now?

41:00.809 --> 41:02.476
You've made her do your chores.

41:02.510 --> 41:04.411
And then you promised
to do hers next week?

41:04.446 --> 41:05.846
So?
You lied to her.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.481
She's not even going
to be here next week.

41:07.515 --> 41:09.650
What's the big deal?
She's a freak.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.085
V, that girl needs us.

41:11.119 --> 41:13.020
I mean, you heard
that messed-up story of hers.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.688
Not to mention,
she thought I wanted

41:14.723 --> 41:16.657
to have sex with her today.
What?

41:16.691 --> 41:18.359
Yeah. Sex.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.227
A 13-year-old girl.

41:20.261 --> 41:22.463
Who knows what crazy family
she's going to get

41:22.497 --> 41:23.998
if we give her back?

41:24.032 --> 41:26.000
Kevin, we're not keeping her.

41:26.034 --> 41:28.502
I think we should, until
she gets a permanent home.

41:28.536 --> 41:31.372
We can help her live
like a normal child.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.007
This is none of our business.

41:33.041 --> 41:34.942
We signed on for it.
No. You signed on for it.

41:34.976 --> 41:36.443
I signed on for the money.

41:39.014 --> 41:40.147
Where are you going?

41:40.181 --> 41:42.149
I'm sleeping on the couch.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.856
Mom?

41:48.890 --> 41:50.791
What's wrong?

41:50.825 --> 41:52.526
Frank left.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.861
No, he didn't.

41:53.895 --> 41:55.496
He's at the Gallaghers'.

41:55.530 --> 41:57.865
Because he's lost
interest in me.

41:57.899 --> 42:00.334
Lip says he'll
be back to normal

42:00.368 --> 42:02.102
as soon as he
starts drinking again.

42:05.473 --> 42:06.874
Do you think so?

42:06.908 --> 42:08.676
I do.

42:26.394 --> 42:28.362
What the hell is that?

42:36.071 --> 42:37.671
Dad, what the hell
are you doing?

42:37.706 --> 42:39.206
Are you fucking kidding me?!

42:39.240 --> 42:41.075
Remodeling.
Son, grab that copper wire.

42:41.109 --> 42:42.276
It's worth a lot
of money these days.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.344
No! Dad, stop!

42:44.379 --> 42:46.146
Why the fuck
is our couch on the wall?

42:46.181 --> 42:47.481
We need a fresh start.

42:47.515 --> 42:49.950
There's a gas line right there.
Oh.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.652
All right. Fine.

42:51.686 --> 42:53.287
We'll start the demolition
in the bathroom, kids.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.789
Yeah!

43:02.530 --> 43:04.398
Last time, he ripped up
the floorboards, remember?

43:04.432 --> 43:05.532
Shit.

43:07.368 --> 43:09.670
Said he was gonna put in
Saltillo tiles. Of course,

43:09.704 --> 43:11.004
he never did.

43:11.039 --> 43:12.172
Yeah, and I had to date

43:12.207 --> 43:13.607
that flooring guy for a month

43:13.641 --> 43:15.342
to get him to finish the work.

43:15.376 --> 43:17.211
What are we gonna do?

43:17.245 --> 43:19.680
We have to kill the turtle.

43:19.714 --> 43:21.882
Daddy and Carl
are up in the attic

43:21.916 --> 43:23.617
getting ready
to cut a hole in the roof

43:23.651 --> 43:25.419
for a skylight.

43:25.453 --> 43:26.787
It's time to kill the turtle.

43:26.821 --> 43:28.388
Now, Debs, you know

43:28.423 --> 43:31.058
that you guys were the
turtle in my story, right?

43:31.092 --> 43:33.026
Oh.

43:33.061 --> 43:34.461
Right.

43:34.496 --> 43:35.996
That's okay. I get what
you're saying, though.

43:36.030 --> 43:37.965
Thanks.

43:37.999 --> 43:39.566
You sure about this?

43:39.601 --> 43:42.603
It'll hurt less now
than if we wait two more weeks.

43:42.637 --> 43:43.837
Okay.

43:43.872 --> 43:45.405
What's up with the turtle?

43:45.440 --> 43:47.908
You wouldn't understand.

43:55.283 --> 43:57.184
Daddy, help!
I think I see a mouse!

43:57.218 --> 43:58.352
A mouse?

43:58.386 --> 44:00.854
Hold on.
I'll be right down.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.791
Where is the little...

44:09.964 --> 44:12.566
I thought the
Taser didn't work.

44:12.600 --> 44:13.967
Yeah. I just told Carl that.

44:14.002 --> 44:16.236
I took the batteries out.

44:17.272 --> 44:19.072
All right.
Open his mouth.

44:22.110 --> 44:25.813
No. No! No. No.

44:43.865 --> 44:45.966
What happened?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.202
It's better this way, Carl.

44:55.543 --> 44:56.777
You seen Kev?

44:56.811 --> 44:58.212
He went to play basketball.

44:58.246 --> 45:00.247
Oh.

45:02.417 --> 45:04.284
How about some breakfast?

45:04.319 --> 45:06.553
I make a mean French toast.

45:06.588 --> 45:08.121
Come on.

45:08.156 --> 45:10.157
Put the Brillo down.

45:11.192 --> 45:13.660
Sit.

45:13.695 --> 45:16.230
When I was a kid, my mother
would make me and my brother

45:16.264 --> 45:17.631
anything we wanted for
dinner on our birthday.

45:17.665 --> 45:19.800
I always asked
for French toast.

45:19.834 --> 45:21.235
Hey.

45:21.269 --> 45:22.970
Hey.

45:24.205 --> 45:26.240
We're having French toast.

45:28.409 --> 45:29.977
Cool.

45:31.512 --> 45:32.579
I'm gonna go take
a quick shower.

45:32.614 --> 45:33.680
I'll be right back.

45:33.715 --> 45:34.815
Could I ask a favor, please?

45:34.849 --> 45:35.983
Sure, sweetie.

45:36.017 --> 45:38.485
If I'm going to be
staying here for a while,

45:38.519 --> 45:41.154
would it be all right if
my son Jonah came to visit?

45:44.192 --> 45:45.425
It is absolutely critical

45:45.460 --> 45:47.794
that as we move
to get recovery back on track,

45:47.829 --> 45:49.997
that we commit
to the American people

45:50.031 --> 45:52.165
that we're willing to get
on a path to sustainability...

45:52.200 --> 45:55.335
Just bracelet.
No bone.

45:55.370 --> 45:58.038
Now, again, we propose
to do that beginning...

45:58.072 --> 46:01.375
I'm so sorry I've been MIA.
I just had to...

46:01.409 --> 46:04.444
I didn't even notice.
Come on.

46:04.479 --> 46:07.047
Tim Geithner's telling us
how everything's okay.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.584
Frank.

46:10.618 --> 46:11.952
Fuck off.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.126
And you're absolutely right.

46:19.160 --> 46:22.496
We need to look very carefully
at the impact of the overall

46:22.530 --> 46:24.064
tax burden
on the American economy,

46:24.098 --> 46:27.000
and the effect that has
on incentives

46:27.035 --> 46:28.936
for investment
and savings and growth.

46:28.970 --> 46:30.270
And that basic approach
underpins

46:30.305 --> 46:32.773
the proposals we've made...

46:53.061 --> 47:03.408

47:22.824 --> 47:24.658
Are you drunk?

47:24.692 --> 47:26.426
That I am.
