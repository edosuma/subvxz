00:47.480 --> 00:52.349
Have you ever felt like
you were a little bit different?

00:52.519 --> 00:55.386
Like you had something unique
to offer the world...

00:55.555 --> 00:58.683
...if you could just get people
to see it.

00:59.893 --> 01:04.159
Then you know exactly how it felt...

01:04.330 --> 01:06.389
...to be me.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.760
Go ahead, Flint.

01:09.536 --> 01:14.303
What is the number one problem
facing our community today?

01:14.774 --> 01:16.298
Untied shoelaces.

01:17.477 --> 01:21.880
Which is why I've invented
a laceless alternative foot covering.

01:22.048 --> 01:24.312
Spray-On Shoes.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.122
- Voilà.
- They're so nifty.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.016
How you gonna get them off, nerd?

01:36.996 --> 01:40.898
What a freak.
He wants to be smart, but that's lame.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.467
I wanted to run away that day.

01:49.809 --> 01:53.506
But you can't run away
from your own feet.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.220
Not every sardine is meant
to swim, son.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.752
I don't understand
fishing metaphors.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.193
- What did I say?
- Don't worry.

02:14.033 --> 02:18.163
Honey, I think your shoes
are wonderful.

02:18.338 --> 02:20.636
Everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.172
So?

02:22.342 --> 02:25.311
People probably thought
that these guys were weirdoes too.

02:26.679 --> 02:28.544
But that never stopped them.

02:28.715 --> 02:33.152
I was saving this
for your birthday, but here.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.117
A professional-grade lab coat.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.189
Just like the real guys wear.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.893
It fits perfect.

02:42.061 --> 02:45.030
The world needs
your originality, Flint.

02:45.899 --> 02:48.891
You just have to grow into it.

02:49.068 --> 02:52.697
And I know that you're gonna do
big things someday.

03:16.262 --> 03:17.786
From that moment on...

03:17.964 --> 03:21.263
...I was determined
to invent something great.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.267
Remote Control Television.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.130
And, the pitch is in.

03:29.242 --> 03:30.266
Eventually.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.604
Hair Un-Balder.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.475
Flying Car.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.047
Monkey Thought Translator.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.949
- Hungry. Hungry. Hungry.
- How wise.

03:42.121 --> 03:46.558
No, Steve. No, no, no, no, no!
No, please! Leave it-

03:47.126 --> 03:48.616
Ratbirds.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.888
Hey, what's going on, little guy?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.055
Flint Lockwood.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.829
My dream was to help
my hometown...

03:57.003 --> 04:00.632
...a tiny island hidden under
the "A " in "Atlantic"...

04:01.074 --> 04:03.736
...called Swallow Falls.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.574
We were famous for sardines...

04:07.413 --> 04:11.076
...until the day the Baby Brent
Sardine Cannery closed for good.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.846
Right after everyone in the world
realized that sardines...

04:15.021 --> 04:16.214
...are super gross.

04:17.656 --> 04:23.687
Soon, all of us were stuck eating
the sardines that no one else wanted.

04:23.863 --> 04:30.200
Poached, fried, boiled, dried,
candied and juiced.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.735
Life became gray and flavorless.

04:33.906 --> 04:38.104
But when all seemed lost,
I stared at defeat...

04:39.012 --> 04:40.343
...and found hope.

05:08.587 --> 05:11.055
My name is Flint Lockwood.

05:11.590 --> 05:14.491
And I was about to invent
a machine...

05:14.659 --> 05:16.490
...that turns water...

05:16.661 --> 05:18.822
...into food.

05:19.731 --> 05:23.724
Steve, my best friend
and trusted colleague.

05:24.135 --> 05:25.159
Steve.

05:25.337 --> 05:28.067
Can I count on your help?

05:30.475 --> 05:31.499
Can.

05:32.844 --> 05:34.436
I knew I could.

05:34.613 --> 05:37.173
Button, on.
Memory, activate.

05:37.349 --> 05:41.217
Blueprints, awesome.
Begin nano-mutation.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.981
Radiation matrix, secure.

05:44.556 --> 05:46.148
Computer, boot.

05:47.826 --> 05:49.987
Coolness enhancement, complete.

05:50.161 --> 05:51.992
Engage coffee break.

05:55.700 --> 05:57.361
Networking power grid.

06:05.377 --> 06:08.369
Beginning conversion of water...

06:08.546 --> 06:10.207
...into food.

06:10.382 --> 06:12.441
Hydrating protein matrix.

06:12.917 --> 06:15.545
Calibrating flavor panel.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.553
Priming chow plopper.

06:19.157 --> 06:22.217
Uploading cool machine voice.

06:23.595 --> 06:25.153
Cheeseburger.

06:26.097 --> 06:30.090
Everyone is going to love this.

06:55.894 --> 06:57.122
Flint!

06:57.295 --> 06:58.762
Sorry, Dad.

06:59.230 --> 07:01.198
Steve, keep working.

07:04.602 --> 07:06.934
Scanning hand.

07:24.422 --> 07:27.016
That's a really weird dude.

07:31.496 --> 07:34.158
Re-energizing tower unit.

07:39.304 --> 07:41.363
Jeez. See you, Dad.

07:43.074 --> 07:44.598
Flint.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.876
Don't you think it's time to give up
this inventing thing, get a real job?

07:54.052 --> 07:55.542
No, why?

07:55.720 --> 08:00.157
Well, all your technology stuff,
it just ends in disaster.

08:00.325 --> 08:03.192
The ratbirds, yes, they escaped
and bred at a surprising rate.

08:03.361 --> 08:06.023
But I took care of that problem
and disposed of them.

08:06.197 --> 08:08.028
Billy, just play dead.

08:08.199 --> 08:12.431
Flint, you don't keep throwing your net
where there aren't any fish.

08:12.604 --> 08:14.367
- What?
- I want you to work full-time...

08:14.539 --> 08:17.235
-... at the tackle shop.
- The tackle shop? Dad, no.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.000
Tackle is a good career.

08:19.177 --> 08:20.804
Please, I'm so close with this one.

08:20.979 --> 08:25.109
I just have to hook it up to the power
station and give it power and it'll work.

08:25.283 --> 08:27.308
And then you could sell food
in the shop...

08:27.485 --> 08:30.249
...and then everyone won't have to eat
sardines anymore.

08:30.421 --> 08:34.015
It is going to be so awesome.

08:34.726 --> 08:36.784
I'm sorry, son.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.087
No more inventing.

08:38.263 --> 08:41.390
Dad, I know I can do this.

08:41.566 --> 08:42.760
And Mom did too.

08:44.969 --> 08:48.564
It had been almost 10 years
since Mom died...

08:48.740 --> 08:52.073
...and Dad still didn't understand me
like she did.

08:52.243 --> 08:55.701
Come on. Let's open the shop.

08:58.483 --> 09:01.350
Tim and Son
Sardine Bait and Tackle.

09:02.821 --> 09:04.618
You feeling it?

09:08.059 --> 09:10.960
Look out, Baby Brent!

09:12.897 --> 09:14.421
Baby Brent Sardines.

09:14.599 --> 09:17.227
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.

09:17.402 --> 09:22.203
As your mayor, I know it's time to put
our sardine-canning past behind us...

09:22.373 --> 09:24.671
...and look to the future.

09:24.843 --> 09:26.902
Sardine tourism!

09:28.313 --> 09:30.338
That's why,
without consulting anyone...

09:30.515 --> 09:34.144
...I spent the entire town budget
on the thing that is under this tarp...

09:34.319 --> 09:36.787
...which I will be unveiling today...

09:36.955 --> 09:38.786
...at noon.

09:38.957 --> 09:43.587
Featuring a live appearance
by Baby Brent himself.

09:43.761 --> 09:47.060
What is up, everybody?

09:47.232 --> 09:49.166
- Hey.
- Hey, it's Baby Brent.

09:49.334 --> 09:53.395
What you doing? Stacking cans
with me on them as a baby?

09:55.940 --> 09:58.272
Anyways, who wants to watch me
cut the ribbon...

09:58.443 --> 10:00.035
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?

10:00.211 --> 10:03.942
I'll be using these bad boys
to help save the town.

10:06.517 --> 10:09.350
All right, you guys.
Sardines, yeah.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.354
- Swallow Falls forever!
- What a delight.

10:13.524 --> 10:17.358
Listen, you- Maybe you wanna go
to that unveiling?

10:17.528 --> 10:21.487
You know, Dad, why don't you
go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.

10:21.666 --> 10:24.567
Really? You sure you can handle it?

10:24.736 --> 10:27.068
Yeah, Dad,
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.

10:27.639 --> 10:28.799
All right, then.

10:28.973 --> 10:31.908
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.

10:32.076 --> 10:34.271
Okay. Bye.

10:42.086 --> 10:44.987
This hellhole is too small
for me, Brent.

10:45.156 --> 10:47.056
I wanna be big.

10:47.225 --> 10:51.685
I want people to look at me and say,
"That is one big mayor. "

10:51.863 --> 10:53.728
And that's why this has to work.

10:53.898 --> 10:55.559
It has to work.

10:55.733 --> 10:58.896
Otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor
of a tiny town...

10:59.070 --> 11:02.437
...full of tiny sardine-sucking
knuckle-scrapers.

11:02.607 --> 11:04.074
But not me, right?

11:04.242 --> 11:08.736
Oh, not you, Brent. No.
You've always been like a son to me.

11:11.349 --> 11:13.579
Hey, everybody.

11:15.420 --> 11:20.551
Under this tarp is the greatest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

11:20.725 --> 11:23.319
We just need 17,000 more gigajoules.

11:23.494 --> 11:26.395
- An attraction so...
- Go, go, go.

11:27.832 --> 11:29.595
What are you doing, Flint Lockwood?

11:29.767 --> 11:32.292
Just holding my hands
behind my back respectfully, sir.

11:32.470 --> 11:34.404
- You know what you are, Lockwood?
- No.

11:34.572 --> 11:36.403
A shenaniganizer.

11:36.574 --> 11:37.939
A tomfool.

11:38.109 --> 11:40.373
- You see my beautiful angel son Cal?
- What's up?

11:40.545 --> 11:43.036
I love him so much.
This is my only son.

11:43.214 --> 11:44.841
I want him to have a bright future.

11:45.016 --> 11:47.280
A future in which you don't ruin
our town's day...

11:47.452 --> 11:49.682
...with one of your
crazy science thingies.

11:49.854 --> 11:53.017
- Well, that's all behind me-
- You see this contact lens, Lockwood?

11:53.191 --> 11:55.250
- This contact lens represent you.
- All right.

11:55.426 --> 11:57.656
- And my eye represents my eye.
- Okay.

11:57.829 --> 12:02.562
I got my eye on you.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.999
- Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker.
- Hey.

12:06.671 --> 12:10.607
And I've arranged for live coverage
from a major network...

12:10.775 --> 12:14.336
...and their most experienced
professional reporter.

12:15.713 --> 12:18.546
Oh, just send the intern.
She's cute, and she's super perky.

12:18.716 --> 12:22.948
Well, those are the only things we look
for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.

12:23.121 --> 12:26.318
How would you like to do a weather
report from a rinky-dink island...

12:26.491 --> 12:28.982
...in the middle of the ocean
as a favor to my cousin?

12:29.160 --> 12:30.218
Really?

12:30.862 --> 12:32.261
Can you believe it, Manny?

12:32.430 --> 12:35.991
Temporary
professional meteorologist.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.725
Okay, Manny, what about this?

12:37.902 --> 12:39.733
Welcome, America,
I'm Sam Sparks.

12:39.904 --> 12:42.270
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.499
America, hi. I didn't see you there.

12:44.675 --> 12:46.040
It's me, Sam Sparks.

12:46.210 --> 12:50.579
On my way across the ocean.

12:51.082 --> 12:55.712
Now, when she gets here,
I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.

12:55.887 --> 12:57.548
Act like, "Hey, whoa. "

12:58.256 --> 13:01.555
This is a great idea.

13:02.226 --> 13:03.750
Weather News Network.

13:03.928 --> 13:05.555
Weather news happens...

13:05.730 --> 13:07.061
...or not.

13:07.231 --> 13:08.823
Now we're over to Swallow Falls...

13:09.000 --> 13:11.332
...where our intern
is on her first day on the job.

13:11.502 --> 13:14.164
Or should I say, first gray on the job.

13:14.338 --> 13:15.930
Looks pretty cloudy there, intern.

13:16.107 --> 13:18.041
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.

13:18.576 --> 13:23.479
It's Swallow Falls degrees and-
Well, let's just go to the mayor.

13:23.648 --> 13:27.948
Thank you and welcome,
national television audience.

13:28.119 --> 13:32.715
You are about to witness
an historic event, undoubtedly...

13:36.127 --> 13:39.460
And now, here to cut
the ceremonial ribbon...

13:39.630 --> 13:44.829
...Swallow Falls' favorite son,
Baby Brent!

13:45.002 --> 13:46.367
He's still got it, folks.

13:46.537 --> 13:47.663
Yeah.

13:49.240 --> 13:53.336
I'm the best person
in the whole town.

13:58.683 --> 14:01.618
Food synthesis, go.

14:03.721 --> 14:07.623
My chest hairs are tingling.
Something's wrong.

14:08.392 --> 14:13.659
Well, here it is. The attraction
the whole world has been waiting for:

14:13.831 --> 14:15.958
Sardine Land.

14:18.202 --> 14:20.329
With rides and exhibits.

14:20.505 --> 14:24.566
And featuring Shamo,
the world's largest sardine...

14:24.742 --> 14:27.973
...and his flaming hoop of glory.

14:28.846 --> 14:31.838
Those of you in the splash zone,
look out.

14:32.016 --> 14:33.142
Yeah.

14:40.191 --> 14:42.022
Cheeseburger.

14:42.193 --> 14:43.251
Flint Lockwood.

14:43.427 --> 14:46.658
Just a second.
I'm in the middle of a-

14:55.239 --> 15:01.371
Well, looks like things in Swallow Falls
are sardine to get better. For-

15:01.546 --> 15:03.309
What just happened to me?

15:03.481 --> 15:04.641
Sorry.

15:26.204 --> 15:28.035
No.

15:28.973 --> 15:30.668
You're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.

15:30.841 --> 15:35.278
Thank goodness you only caused
minimal damage to Sardine Land.

15:41.185 --> 15:42.209
Come on.

15:51.762 --> 15:54.253
I really shouldn't be running
with these.

15:57.702 --> 16:00.364
Jump, jump, jump, run, run,
jump, jump, run.

16:22.059 --> 16:24.653
- It's a good thing no one got hurt!
- Flint Lockwood!

16:24.829 --> 16:29.027
I didn't get hurt, but that does
not mean that I'm not still mad at you.

17:34.298 --> 17:36.528
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.
Are you okay?

17:36.701 --> 17:39.693
- I didn't get a chance to-
- It's okay, it's just pain.

17:39.870 --> 17:41.462
Sorry, I'm not myself today.

17:41.639 --> 17:46.576
My whole career was ruined by some
crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.

17:47.678 --> 17:49.339
Wait a minute.

17:49.513 --> 17:51.981
What is going on with your feet?

17:52.149 --> 17:54.879
Spray-On Shoes.
They don't come off.

17:55.052 --> 17:56.417
Cool.

17:57.288 --> 17:59.313
This could solve
the untied shoes epidemic.

17:59.490 --> 18:02.550
What are they made of, some kind of
elastic biopolymer adhesive?

18:02.727 --> 18:04.160
Yeah.

18:04.328 --> 18:05.352
Exactly.

18:05.529 --> 18:07.258
I mean...

18:07.698 --> 18:11.065
Wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.

18:12.002 --> 18:13.230
- Flint.
- Steve.

18:13.838 --> 18:16.398
- Is that a Monkey Thought Translator?
- Steve.

18:17.775 --> 18:22.109
Incredible.
Did you make all of this stuff?

18:22.513 --> 18:25.243
- You hit me with a rocket.
- You kicked me in the face.

18:25.416 --> 18:27.509
I said I was sorry.

18:28.319 --> 18:31.686
Do you know how hard it is
to break into the weather game?

18:31.856 --> 18:35.553
I spent my entire life building up
to that moment.

18:36.327 --> 18:38.454
You get one shot at the show.

18:38.629 --> 18:40.722
And if you don't make it...

18:40.898 --> 18:44.390
...it's back to cleaning
the barometers.

18:51.475 --> 18:53.136
Cheese?

18:57.581 --> 19:01.312
But that could only mean...

19:48.432 --> 19:51.333
Excited. Excited.

20:01.745 --> 20:03.110
My machine works.

20:04.982 --> 20:09.146
It really works!

20:12.189 --> 20:13.679
Your machine?

20:13.858 --> 20:15.553
Is that what that rocket was?

20:17.061 --> 20:18.688
Do you like it?

20:19.096 --> 20:20.120
I love it!

20:20.598 --> 20:23.032
This is just amazing.
Look at this.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.998
This is the greatest weather
phenomenon in history.

20:26.170 --> 20:28.138
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?

20:31.041 --> 20:33.009
Manny, get your camera.

20:48.592 --> 20:53.029
This just in: Our humiliated weather
intern is apparently back for more.

20:53.197 --> 20:56.496
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody,
you are not gonna believe this one...

20:56.667 --> 21:01.104
...but I am standing
in the middle of a burger rain.

21:01.272 --> 21:02.899
You may have seen
a meteor shower...

21:03.073 --> 21:06.873
...but you've never seen a shower
meatier than this.

21:07.044 --> 21:11.174
For a town stuck eating sardines,
this is totally manna from heaven.

21:11.348 --> 21:14.340
This tastes significantly better
than sardines.

21:21.358 --> 21:24.020
This is going to be big.

21:24.194 --> 21:26.287
This food weather
was created intentionally...

21:26.463 --> 21:29.660
...by meek-ish backyard tinkerer
Flint Lockwood.

21:29.833 --> 21:31.824
Flint Lockwood?

21:32.002 --> 21:33.026
Hi.

21:33.203 --> 21:35.262
You're under arrest
for ruining Sardine Land.

21:35.439 --> 21:37.031
Flint, those burgers were awesome.

21:37.207 --> 21:40.574
The producer called and he was like,
"Everybody loves that food weather. "

21:40.744 --> 21:41.938
- Food weather.
- What?

21:42.112 --> 21:43.909
This could be bigger
than Sardine Land.

21:44.081 --> 21:45.844
- Can you make it rain food again?
- No.

21:46.016 --> 21:48.211
- I don't know if I-
- You're gonna do it again?

21:48.385 --> 21:49.716
You gotta be kidding.

21:49.887 --> 21:52.082
Please, please, please.

21:54.992 --> 21:56.789
- Yes.
- No.

21:56.961 --> 21:59.657
- Give me one more chance.
- We know this was an accident.

21:59.830 --> 22:01.957
- I know.
- Cheeseburgers from the sky...

22:02.132 --> 22:03.724
...that's not natural.

22:03.901 --> 22:06.563
My invention could save
the whole town.

22:06.737 --> 22:09.331
You will be so proud of me, Dad.

22:09.506 --> 22:11.303
Plus...

22:11.475 --> 22:12.840
...there's a girl here.

22:15.145 --> 22:19.104
Can you look me in the eye and
tell me you've got this under control...

22:19.283 --> 22:21.308
...and it's not gonna end up
in a disaster?

22:22.186 --> 22:23.448
Yes.

22:38.035 --> 22:41.129
I've got this under control,
and it's not gonna end in disaster.

22:43.407 --> 22:45.466
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad.

22:45.643 --> 22:48.874
- Oh, sure.
- Okay. So, Sam...

22:49.046 --> 22:53.142
...this is where the magic happens.

22:54.451 --> 22:57.818
Lick. Lick. Lick.

22:57.988 --> 23:01.219
Lick. Lick. Lick.

23:02.693 --> 23:04.126
Welcome, Flint.

23:06.497 --> 23:09.057
You seriously spend
a lot of time alone.

23:09.233 --> 23:10.666
What?

23:13.270 --> 23:14.567
So here's how it works.

23:14.738 --> 23:18.731
Water goes in the top,
and food comes out the bottom.

23:18.909 --> 23:20.774
When you shot it
into the stratosphere...

23:20.944 --> 23:24.675
...you figured it would induce a phase
change from the cumulonimbus layer?

23:24.848 --> 23:27.840
That's actually
a really smart observation.

23:28.018 --> 23:29.713
I mean...

23:30.521 --> 23:32.955
The clouds probably have water
in them...

23:33.123 --> 23:36.524
...which, I guess, is why
you shot it up there in the first place.

23:36.694 --> 23:38.821
Right, right. That's why I did that.

23:38.996 --> 23:40.987
- On purpose.
- Right. Yeah.

23:41.165 --> 23:42.894
- Right.
- Of course.

23:44.435 --> 23:45.993
Okay.

23:46.170 --> 23:49.264
The machine uses a principle
of hydro-genetic mutation.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.432
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation...

23:52.609 --> 23:56.067
...which mutates their genetic recipe
into any kind of food you want.

23:56.246 --> 23:57.406
So...

23:57.581 --> 23:58.605
- Pizza?
- Yes.

23:58.782 --> 23:59.908
- Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

24:00.084 --> 24:01.551
- Peas?
- Yes, that's also a food.

24:01.719 --> 24:02.947
- Steak? Apples?
- Yes.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.553
- Apple sauce? BLT?
- Yes.

24:04.722 --> 24:06.883
- I said any kind of food.
- Chicken wings?

24:07.057 --> 24:09.719
Think about what you're saying,
and if it's a food, yes.

24:09.893 --> 24:12.191
- Baloney.
- Baloney. That is a food.

24:12.362 --> 24:14.626
- How about Jell-O?
- Do you like Jell-O?

24:14.798 --> 24:16.265
I love Jell-O.

24:16.433 --> 24:18.833
I love Jell-O too.
Oh, and peanut butter, right?

24:19.002 --> 24:21.402
Oh, no, no, no,
I am severely allergic to peanuts.

24:21.572 --> 24:22.596
Hey, me too.

24:22.773 --> 24:24.365
- What's it called?
- Peanut allergy.

24:24.541 --> 24:25.599
- No, the machine.
- Of course.

24:26.176 --> 24:28.974
It's called the Flint Lockwood
Diatonic Super-Mutating...

24:29.146 --> 24:31.273
...Dynamic Food Replicator.

24:31.448 --> 24:33.109
Or, for short:

24:33.283 --> 24:35.046
The FLDSMDFR.

24:35.552 --> 24:36.644
Fliminadifiser?

24:36.820 --> 24:38.151
FLDSMDFR.

24:38.322 --> 24:39.721
Fliminubahdibferer?

24:39.890 --> 24:41.517
Fli.

24:41.692 --> 24:43.455
Suh.

24:43.727 --> 24:44.989
Fdiferf.

24:46.330 --> 24:49.231
Manny, make sure you get this.
He's gonna make the food now.

24:49.399 --> 24:50.423
Now?

24:50.601 --> 24:54.332
Well, the thing is, I can't...

24:54.505 --> 24:57.565
...wait to show you
this hilarious Internet video.

24:58.675 --> 24:59.699
What?

24:59.877 --> 25:01.105
Fight the power!

25:01.278 --> 25:03.246
What is this?

25:07.718 --> 25:09.015
It's so cute.

25:09.186 --> 25:11.017
Pushing. Folding. Connecting.

25:11.188 --> 25:13.986
Taping. Turning.
Painting. Switching.

25:14.158 --> 25:15.284
Staring.

25:15.459 --> 25:16.824
Motivating.

25:16.994 --> 25:19.519
- Placing button.
- I can't believe I've been watching this...

25:19.696 --> 25:21.755
-... for three hours.
- I know.

25:31.008 --> 25:32.202
It's working.

25:32.376 --> 25:34.367
What do you guys want for breakfast?

25:34.545 --> 25:36.536
- Gummi Bears.
- Whoa, Steve, no.

25:36.713 --> 25:38.874
We both know how you get
around Gummi Bears.

25:39.049 --> 25:40.448
How about...

25:40.617 --> 25:42.175
-... eggs.
- And toast.

25:42.352 --> 25:43.649
Orange juice.

25:43.821 --> 25:45.516
- And bacon.
- Bacon.

25:46.523 --> 25:47.854
What are you doing?

25:48.025 --> 25:49.458
Nothing.

25:49.626 --> 25:50.650
To the computer.

25:55.599 --> 25:58.033
So you're sure this is safe?

25:58.569 --> 26:01.060
Don't worry. I have a Dangeometer
that lets us know...

26:01.238 --> 26:03.001
...if the food is going
to over-mutate.

26:03.173 --> 26:05.073
What happens
if the food over-mutates?

26:05.242 --> 26:07.642
I don't know.
But that'll never happen.

26:07.811 --> 26:10.177
All right, this probably
won't explode.

26:10.347 --> 26:11.371
What?

26:18.088 --> 26:19.749
Bacon.

26:26.330 --> 26:28.423
Those cheeseburgers
were only the beginning...

26:28.599 --> 26:31.363
...because a breakfast system
is on its way to Swallow Falls.

26:31.535 --> 26:32.729
My forecast?

26:32.903 --> 26:34.837
Sunny side up.

26:42.212 --> 26:44.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:53.190 --> 26:56.591
Flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?

26:56.760 --> 26:58.091
All right, here's the skinny:

26:58.262 --> 27:01.129
You keep making it rain
the snackadoos...

27:01.298 --> 27:03.266
...weathergirl provides
free advertising...

27:03.433 --> 27:05.628
...I have taken out
a very high-interest loan...

27:05.802 --> 27:08.862
...to convert this Podunk town
into a tourist food-topia.

27:09.039 --> 27:12.440
All you have to do is make it rain food
three meals a day...

27:12.609 --> 27:14.577
...every day
for the foreseeable future...

27:14.745 --> 27:17.509
...and in 30 days we hold a grand
reopening of the island...

27:17.681 --> 27:20.479
...as a must-see cruise destination.

27:20.651 --> 27:23.279
And everyone, everywhere...

27:23.453 --> 27:27.787
...is going to love your invention.

27:28.158 --> 27:29.455
Do you think so?

27:29.626 --> 27:32.060
I know so.

27:36.433 --> 27:39.425
Now that's what I call
poultry in motion.

27:49.346 --> 27:51.906
Mr. Lockwood,
may I please have waffles?

27:52.082 --> 27:53.413
- Falafels?
- Jellybeans.

27:53.583 --> 27:54.948
- Avocado.
- Coming right up.

27:57.821 --> 27:59.015
Leftovers?

27:59.189 --> 28:02.556
Not a problem with Flint Lockwood's
latest invention, the Outtasighter...

28:02.726 --> 28:05.627
...so-named because it catapults
uneaten food out of sight...

28:05.796 --> 28:08.287
...and therefore, out of mind.

28:16.974 --> 28:18.669
Jellybeans!

28:18.842 --> 28:19.866
Awesome.

28:20.043 --> 28:22.341
- BLT.
- Doughnuts.

28:23.180 --> 28:24.545
Pie.

28:24.715 --> 28:25.739
Gummi bears.

28:25.949 --> 28:28.213
- Fish.
- Crème brûlée!

28:30.620 --> 28:32.554
A pizza stuffed inside a turkey...

28:32.723 --> 28:35.521
...the whole thing deep-fried
and dipped in chocolate.

28:36.226 --> 28:38.091
It's me, the mayor.

28:38.695 --> 28:40.060
You look different.

28:40.230 --> 28:41.993
Did you get a new haircut?

28:42.165 --> 28:44.190
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.

28:53.010 --> 28:54.800
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
- I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.

28:54.978 --> 28:56.741
I love spending time with you, Dad.

29:01.018 --> 29:03.646
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back
to the lab.

29:03.820 --> 29:07.654
If you wanna come,
I could show you how I make the food.

29:08.158 --> 29:09.648
No, thanks.

29:09.826 --> 29:14.957
That techno-food, it's too complicated
for an old fisherman.

29:15.132 --> 29:16.997
Got it.

29:17.934 --> 29:21.335
Could still use your help around here,
though, you know.

29:21.505 --> 29:24.167
I'm working
with the mayor now, Dad.

29:24.341 --> 29:27.504
I mean, the town's grand reopening
is in, like, a week.

29:27.677 --> 29:29.941
Right. Got it.

29:36.653 --> 29:38.985
Flint Lockwood?

29:39.623 --> 29:41.250
Yeah?

29:42.726 --> 29:44.990
It's my son Cal's birthday
tomorrow...

29:45.162 --> 29:48.563
...and I was just wondering if you
could make it rain something special.

29:48.732 --> 29:51.132
Well, I'm pretty backed up
on requests.

29:51.301 --> 29:52.962
Plus, you're always mean to me.

29:53.136 --> 29:54.967
It'll be just one time...

29:55.138 --> 29:57.606
...for my special angel's special day.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.240
I don't know.

30:00.410 --> 30:03.709
You know, I don't wanna
overwork the machine, so...

30:03.880 --> 30:07.372
Okay. I knew it was a long shot.

30:07.551 --> 30:10.281
I just wanted Cal to see how much
his father loves him.

30:10.454 --> 30:12.217
I thought you would understand.

30:15.192 --> 30:17.387
You know how fathers always trying
to express...

30:17.561 --> 30:21.224
...their love and appreciation
for their sons.

30:25.068 --> 30:26.126
Earl, wait.

30:37.614 --> 30:39.775
Touch. Touch. Touch.

30:41.918 --> 30:43.146
I've got an idea.

31:01.238 --> 31:03.138
Happy birthday, son.

31:03.306 --> 31:04.466
Dad?

31:04.641 --> 31:06.973
This is your day. Go have fun.

31:07.144 --> 31:10.705
- I love you guys. You're awesome.
- I love you too, son.

31:10.881 --> 31:14.476
- Have a good time, baby.
- Ice cream!

31:15.352 --> 31:18.446
Yeah! Cool.

31:20.590 --> 31:22.785
Strawberry's my favorite.

31:35.038 --> 31:36.062
Come on, Dad.

31:36.239 --> 31:37.729
I don't know, Cal.

31:37.908 --> 31:40.274
This doesn't look safe!

31:48.185 --> 31:49.311
I love you, son.

31:49.486 --> 31:52.649
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.523
Flint, this is amazing.

31:58.695 --> 32:01.289
And designing the ice cream
to accumulate into scoops...

32:01.464 --> 32:03.364
...I don't know how
you're gonna top this.

32:03.533 --> 32:06.400
Maybe with hot fudge.

32:08.572 --> 32:09.664
Hey, Flint.

32:09.839 --> 32:11.864
You wanna be in a snowball fight
with us?

32:13.410 --> 32:15.002
Flint, what's the problem?

32:15.178 --> 32:17.373
I've never actually been
in a snowball fight.

32:17.547 --> 32:19.777
- Really?
- I don't even know the rules.

32:19.950 --> 32:23.579
Is there like a point system or is it...

32:23.753 --> 32:25.618
-... to the death?
- No-

32:25.789 --> 32:30.817
You've nev-? I mean, look, even
Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.

32:35.532 --> 32:38.968
So like this?

32:39.502 --> 32:41.697
No, harder than that.

32:44.107 --> 32:46.701
Snowball.
Snowball, snowball, snowball.

32:47.711 --> 32:50.202
Snowball. Snowball.

32:50.380 --> 32:53.372
Well, something to be said
for enthusiasm.

32:53.950 --> 32:55.542
Snowball!

32:56.052 --> 32:57.644
Snowball!

33:00.857 --> 33:02.757
Snowball and snowball.

33:02.926 --> 33:03.984
Kids? What's going on?

33:04.160 --> 33:06.253
Snowball.

33:07.497 --> 33:09.328
- Snowball.
- Snowball. Snowball.

33:09.499 --> 33:10.830
I scream, you scream...

33:11.001 --> 33:15.301
...we all scream for Flint Lockwood's
latest tasty town-wide treat...

33:15.472 --> 33:18.532
...with flurries of frozen fun
on what the mayor declared to be...

33:18.708 --> 33:20.141
...an ice cream snow day.

33:20.310 --> 33:23.837
He'd also like to invite everyone
in the world to catch a cruise liner...

33:24.014 --> 33:25.641
...and come on down
this Saturday...

33:25.815 --> 33:28.306
...for the grand opening
of Chew And Swallow...

33:28.485 --> 33:31.648
...a town that is truly à la mode.

33:39.362 --> 33:42.422
A town that is truly
topped with ice cream.

33:42.599 --> 33:45.534
With today's scoop
for the Weather News Network...

33:45.702 --> 33:48.068
...I'm Sam Sparks.

33:48.238 --> 33:51.969
Flint, this is the best breakfast ever.

33:58.515 --> 33:59.539
That's it!

33:59.716 --> 34:01.445
Researching. Role-playing.

34:01.618 --> 34:03.017
Dialing.

34:03.186 --> 34:04.813
Waiting.

34:07.057 --> 34:08.956
- Sam Sparks.
- Hanging up.

34:09.125 --> 34:11.355
Regretting. Re-psyching.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.393
Saying what I'm doing.

34:13.563 --> 34:15.588
- Flint?
- "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice.

34:15.764 --> 34:18.029
I was wondering if you would like
to go on a da-"

34:18.201 --> 34:19.532
Activity with me tomorrow.

34:21.603 --> 34:24.038
- Okay.
- Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.

34:24.206 --> 34:26.641
Nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.

34:26.810 --> 34:29.870
Keep an eye on the lab for me.

34:31.414 --> 34:33.780
Steve.

34:34.217 --> 34:35.911
Foster still at the plate.

34:36.085 --> 34:38.020
And nobody out.

34:38.188 --> 34:39.655
Where are we going?

34:39.822 --> 34:42.053
Oh, nowhere.
I just thought it'd be nice...

34:42.225 --> 34:46.286
...for the two of us
to go on a walk together.

34:46.463 --> 34:49.489
Like you do as friends.

34:49.933 --> 34:52.993
Oh, my, what's that?

35:02.078 --> 35:03.739
Jell-O's my favorite.

35:04.414 --> 35:06.712
You never made a request, so...

35:06.883 --> 35:08.714
...I made one for you.

35:11.554 --> 35:13.385
Flint?

35:13.556 --> 35:14.921
Flint?

35:15.325 --> 35:16.952
Join me.

35:30.673 --> 35:31.799
But how did you-?

35:31.975 --> 35:35.172
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered
it up with the Outtasighter...

35:35.345 --> 35:37.472
...and then I brought it here
and pressed it...

35:37.647 --> 35:41.208
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic
Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.

35:43.119 --> 35:45.417
Everything's made of Jell-O.

35:45.588 --> 35:47.078
This piano, those sconces...

35:47.257 --> 35:49.725
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O,
that aquarium...

35:49.893 --> 35:51.986
...that Venus de Milo
with your face on it...

35:52.162 --> 35:55.097
...next to a Michelangelo's David
that also has your face.

35:55.899 --> 35:59.096
Come on, Sam,
what are you waiting for?

36:01.271 --> 36:02.568
Nothing!

36:05.308 --> 36:06.332
Yeah.

36:19.355 --> 36:21.084
Cannonball.

36:22.492 --> 36:23.959
Belly flop.

36:27.597 --> 36:29.588
Why did I do that?

36:37.640 --> 36:40.074
- So Jell-O.
- Right. Right, right.

36:40.243 --> 36:41.710
It's a solid, it's a liquid...

36:41.878 --> 36:46.372
...it's a visco-elastic polymer made of
polypeptide chains, but you eat it.

36:46.549 --> 36:48.210
I mean...

36:48.384 --> 36:50.443
...it tastes good.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.554
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

36:52.722 --> 36:56.852
Say something super smart
and then bail from it.

36:58.595 --> 36:59.653
Can you keep a secret?

36:59.829 --> 37:01.592
No.

37:02.565 --> 37:05.056
But this time, sure, yeah.

37:06.202 --> 37:12.163
Okay. Well, it was a really
long time ago, but I, too, was...

37:14.010 --> 37:15.068
...a nerd.

37:15.678 --> 37:16.702
Too?

37:16.880 --> 37:19.246
When I was a little girl...

37:19.415 --> 37:22.009
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...

37:22.185 --> 37:25.882
...and I was totally obsessed
with the science of weather.

37:28.291 --> 37:30.282
Other girls wanted a Barbie.

37:30.460 --> 37:34.328
I wanted a Doppler Weather
Radar 2000 Turbo.

37:34.497 --> 37:37.466
But all the kids used to taunt me
with this lame song.

37:37.634 --> 37:38.658
It wasn't even clever.

37:38.835 --> 37:40.769
Four-eyes, four-eyes

37:40.937 --> 37:42.996
You need glasses to see

37:45.909 --> 37:47.399
Go on.

37:48.244 --> 37:49.609
So I got a new look...

37:49.779 --> 37:52.270
...gave up the science-y
smart stuff...

37:52.448 --> 37:54.575
...and I was never
made fun of again.

37:54.751 --> 37:58.778
And I still need these glasses,
but I never wear them.

37:58.955 --> 38:01.446
- I'll bet you look great with glasses on.
- I'm not-

38:01.624 --> 38:03.114
And on they go.

38:07.096 --> 38:08.120
- What?
- Nothing.

38:08.298 --> 38:09.788
Wait.

38:13.836 --> 38:16.134
It's a Jell-O scrunchie.

38:19.175 --> 38:22.008
And now, the reveal.

38:25.515 --> 38:26.539
Wow.

38:27.784 --> 38:30.412
I mean, you were okay before...

38:30.587 --> 38:32.487
...but now...

38:32.956 --> 38:35.117
...you're beautiful.

38:35.291 --> 38:37.987
No, I'm not. I can't go out in public
like this.

38:38.161 --> 38:40.994
Well, why not?

38:41.164 --> 38:44.224
I mean, this is the real you, right?

38:45.702 --> 38:47.260
Smart.

38:47.437 --> 38:49.405
Bespectacled.

38:50.006 --> 38:51.974
Who wouldn't wanna see that?

38:52.141 --> 38:56.737
You know, I've never met anyone
like you, Flint Lockwood.

38:56.913 --> 38:58.676
Me either.

38:58.848 --> 39:00.975
But about you.

39:17.967 --> 39:19.696
Flint, you have a call

39:19.869 --> 39:21.769
Flint, you have a call

39:21.938 --> 39:23.701
Is your phone ringing?

39:23.873 --> 39:26.899
That's weird.
Someone must've changed my ring.

39:27.076 --> 39:29.203
Oh, it's the mayor.
Do you mind if I take this?

39:29.379 --> 39:30.403
No, no, no.

39:30.580 --> 39:33.344
- Go ahead, take it. That's fine.
- I'm sorry. It's important.

39:33.516 --> 39:36.917
- I should be going too. It's getting late.
- I'm just gonna step outside.

39:47.296 --> 39:49.423
Dad, you came.
I have so much to tell you.

39:49.599 --> 39:52.625
- Do I look all right?
- You look great. Come on, let's go.

39:54.003 --> 39:55.300
Dad, I almost kissed a girl.

39:55.471 --> 39:58.167
- It's Baby Brent, you know?
- It was the coolest thing- Hi.

39:59.008 --> 40:01.841
- I should be on the list.
- Hey, Brian.

40:02.011 --> 40:07.142
What? You're letting that guy in?
That guy's a nerd.

40:09.218 --> 40:11.049
Hey, how's it going?

40:11.688 --> 40:14.122
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

40:14.290 --> 40:17.589
A toast.
To Flint and his delicious steaks.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.695
- Oh, thanks. Thank you.
- Very nice place.

40:20.863 --> 40:22.763
Oh, wow. Thank you.

40:22.932 --> 40:25.833
- Flint Lockwood.
- Earl.

40:31.274 --> 40:32.605
So no roof.

40:32.775 --> 40:35.073
Yep. You just hold out your plate.

40:35.244 --> 40:37.235
And I even made it rain
your favorite:

40:37.413 --> 40:38.437
Meat.

40:45.855 --> 40:46.879
Okay.

40:47.557 --> 40:51.015
So you know how the grand reopening
of the town is tomorrow?

40:51.194 --> 40:56.427
Well, the mayor has asked me
to cut the ribbon.

40:56.599 --> 40:58.965
He said my invention
saved the town.

40:59.402 --> 41:01.734
Aren't you proud of me?

41:09.712 --> 41:11.339
Well...

41:12.115 --> 41:14.413
...doesn't this steak look
a little big to you?

41:16.519 --> 41:21.752
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every
steak is not exactly the same size.

41:21.924 --> 41:24.415
Did you even hear what I just said?

41:25.795 --> 41:27.626
Son, look around.

41:27.797 --> 41:30.322
I'm not sure this is good for people.

41:31.901 --> 41:34.301
Maybe you should think about
turning this thing off.

41:34.470 --> 41:37.234
It's making everybody happy.

41:37.473 --> 41:39.338
Everybody except you.

41:40.009 --> 41:42.273
When are you gonna accept
that this is who I am...

41:42.445 --> 41:46.541
...instead of trying to get me to work
in some boring tackle shop?

41:48.151 --> 41:49.743
Well...

41:50.319 --> 41:52.787
...you seem like you know
what you're doing, then.

41:54.757 --> 41:57.351
I guess I'll just get out of your way.

42:25.421 --> 42:26.649
Get with the times, man.

42:26.823 --> 42:29.485
I mean, there's no pleasing
that guy.

42:29.659 --> 42:33.755
He just wants to take anything good
I do and just smoosh it.

42:43.539 --> 42:45.973
These are big hot dogs.

42:56.319 --> 42:57.843
Man.

42:58.454 --> 43:00.888
I mean, this isn't that bad.

43:01.057 --> 43:02.854
- Is it, Steve?
- Yellow.

43:03.025 --> 43:04.151
You're right, Steve.

43:04.760 --> 43:07.126
The Dangeometer is in the yellow.

43:07.296 --> 43:08.661
I don't know what to do.

43:08.831 --> 43:10.423
I do...

43:11.167 --> 43:13.727
...declare these hot dogs
to be delicious!

43:14.837 --> 43:16.498
Oh, no.

43:17.440 --> 43:18.771
How did you get in here?

43:18.941 --> 43:20.772
Tomorrow's the big day, Flint.

43:21.310 --> 43:24.711
The entire town's fate is resting
on your food weather.

43:24.881 --> 43:26.007
I'm thinking pasta.

43:26.449 --> 43:30.909
Some light apps.
I know you won't let us down.

43:33.022 --> 43:35.923
Well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's
something you should see.

43:36.092 --> 43:37.354
What?

43:37.760 --> 43:41.696
This is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell last week.

43:42.265 --> 43:46.725
And this is the molecular structure
of a hot dog that fell today.

43:47.136 --> 43:48.899
The machine uses
microwave radiation...

43:49.071 --> 43:51.301
...to mutate the genetic recipe
of the food.

43:51.474 --> 43:54.136
The more we ask it to make,
the more clouds it takes in...

43:54.310 --> 43:58.303
...the more radiation it emits, the more
these molecules could over-mutate.

43:59.315 --> 44:01.715
I think that's why the food
is getting bigger.

44:02.752 --> 44:04.549
Here's what I heard:

44:04.720 --> 44:06.915
"Science, science, science, bigger. "

44:07.089 --> 44:08.750
And bigger is better.

44:08.925 --> 44:12.520
Everyone's gonna love
these new portion sizes.

44:13.562 --> 44:14.927
I know I do.

44:17.767 --> 44:19.598
My dad thinks I should turn it off.

44:19.769 --> 44:24.001
Geniuses like us are never understood
by their fathers, Flint.

44:24.173 --> 44:25.265
But what if things go-

44:25.441 --> 44:27.671
Who needs the approval
of one family member...

44:27.843 --> 44:30.710
...when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances?

44:30.880 --> 44:34.407
Not to mention that little cutlet,
Sam Sparks.

44:34.583 --> 44:36.141
And me.

44:36.319 --> 44:40.380
I've always felt that you were
like a son to me, Flint.

44:40.556 --> 44:45.516
And I'm gonna be so proud of you
tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...

44:45.695 --> 44:47.185
...save the town...

44:47.363 --> 44:51.959
...and prove to everybody
what a great inventor you are.

44:52.134 --> 44:54.659
So here's the cheese:

44:54.837 --> 44:56.805
You can keep it going...

44:56.973 --> 44:58.941
...get everything
you've ever wanted...

44:59.108 --> 45:02.407
...and be the great man
I know you can be.

45:02.578 --> 45:05.342
Or you can turn it off...

45:05.514 --> 45:07.277
...ruin everything...

45:07.450 --> 45:11.113
...and no one will ever like you.

45:11.787 --> 45:13.618
It's your choice.

45:13.789 --> 45:15.086
Choice.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.690
Choice.

45:16.859 --> 45:17.883
Choice.

45:18.060 --> 45:19.357
Choice.

45:19.528 --> 45:21.428
Choice.

45:24.166 --> 45:25.190
Okay.

45:36.379 --> 45:39.075
I mean, bigger is better...

45:39.248 --> 45:40.272
...right?

45:40.449 --> 45:42.542
Oh, yeah.

45:46.455 --> 45:50.255
Spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery.
Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.

46:03.672 --> 46:05.970
- Looks safe to me.
- And sanitary too.

46:39.708 --> 46:42.871
Who's hungry?

46:43.045 --> 46:47.607
Welcome, tourists,
to Chew And Swallow.

46:47.783 --> 46:49.307
That is one big mayor.

46:49.485 --> 46:52.943
Delight in our nacho-cheese
hot springs.

46:54.156 --> 46:57.182
Allow your kids to eat
all the junk food they want...

46:57.359 --> 47:00.089
...in our completely
unsupervised Kid Zone!

47:00.262 --> 47:02.287
I've got jellybeans for teeth.

47:02.465 --> 47:04.330
And when the fun is done...

47:04.500 --> 47:08.436
...gaze upon the sunset
cresting over Mount Leftovers.

47:08.604 --> 47:12.404
From which we're protected
by a presumably indestructible dam.

47:12.842 --> 47:16.642
We've got people here today
from all around the world...

47:16.812 --> 47:19.042
...from as far as China
to West Virginia.

47:19.215 --> 47:21.080
Also I think there's
some Canadians here.

47:21.250 --> 47:23.514
- You need to look at this.
- Why aren't you on TV?

47:23.686 --> 47:25.551
You're supposed
to be broadcasting this.

47:25.721 --> 47:28.053
There's a problem.
The food's getting bigger.

47:28.224 --> 47:31.193
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes.
Everyone loves it.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.692
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing here.

47:33.863 --> 47:36.263
What if we've bitten off more
than we can chew?

47:36.432 --> 47:40.368
For the first time in my life, everybody
loves something that I've done.

47:40.536 --> 47:42.731
Why can't you just be
happy for me...

47:42.905 --> 47:45.430
...and go say the weather
or something. Jeez.

47:45.608 --> 47:46.973
And without further ado...

47:47.143 --> 47:51.079
...our town's hero
and my metaphorical son...

47:51.247 --> 47:53.647
...Flint Lockwood.

47:53.816 --> 47:55.147
Yeah, Flint.

47:55.317 --> 47:57.342
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

47:57.520 --> 47:59.147
- Sign my shrimp.
- Thank you.

47:59.321 --> 48:01.221
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I love you.

48:01.724 --> 48:03.885
I admire your quirkiness, dude.

48:04.059 --> 48:07.688
Brent, we're gonna need you
to hand over the ceremonial scissors.

48:08.297 --> 48:09.764
But-

48:09.999 --> 48:11.023
No.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.328
- You can't. You can't take them. No.
- Here you go.

48:15.070 --> 48:17.402
I'm Baby Brent.

48:19.475 --> 48:22.273
Put your clothes back on.

48:22.878 --> 48:25.244
Who am I?

48:27.016 --> 48:29.143
Go ahead, Flint.

48:29.318 --> 48:31.718
Everybody loves you.

48:31.887 --> 48:34.583
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

48:34.757 --> 48:37.692
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!

49:10.793 --> 49:13.853
Danger. Danger. Danger.

49:17.533 --> 49:20.229
Salt-and-pepper wind?

49:22.004 --> 49:23.562
Oregano.

49:40.155 --> 49:43.215
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.

49:48.564 --> 49:50.156
I can turn it off.

50:03.245 --> 50:05.770
All right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.

50:08.484 --> 50:10.475
Oh, no.

50:12.821 --> 50:15.449
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

50:16.191 --> 50:18.716
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

50:22.398 --> 50:24.025
No.

50:31.473 --> 50:33.805
- Gummi Bears.
- Not now, Steve.

50:40.282 --> 50:43.251
Condiments? Salt? Pepper?

50:45.654 --> 50:47.349
Flint.

50:51.393 --> 50:53.725
This is Sam Sparks,
live from Chew And Swallow...

50:53.896 --> 50:55.363
...where a spaghetti twister-

50:55.531 --> 50:59.729
Sam, hey, we love a good storm
over here, but you look like a nerd.

50:59.902 --> 51:04.134
Patrick, several children are stranded
in the path of this tomato tornado.

51:04.440 --> 51:05.964
My tummy hurts.

51:07.843 --> 51:09.140
Cal.

51:10.412 --> 51:13.472
What is that, a scrunchie? I haven't
seen one of those since 1995.

51:13.649 --> 51:17.278
What? We have
an actual weather emergency.

51:17.453 --> 51:19.421
Well, we'll get right back
to that storm...

51:19.588 --> 51:22.352
...and hopefully Sam'll look
a little more appealing.

51:30.032 --> 51:33.593
Steve, we just have to upload the kill
code and then we'll shut down the-

51:33.769 --> 51:34.997
What are you doing here?

51:35.170 --> 51:37.434
I've been ordering dinner
for the last 10 minutes.

51:37.606 --> 51:40.040
- Is something going on?
- I've gotta stop the machine.

51:40.209 --> 51:42.404
Everyone's in danger
because of me.

51:42.578 --> 51:45.445
Oh, it can't be that bad.

51:45.781 --> 51:48.443
- No.
- Well, I'm out of here.

51:48.617 --> 51:51.085
I can still stop the order
with the kill code.

51:54.089 --> 51:56.785
- Sending kill code.
- I'm back.

51:56.959 --> 51:59.018
Got to get the button.

52:00.629 --> 52:01.721
Play. Fun. Fun. Play.

52:01.897 --> 52:06.527
Hey, Flint. It's been nice
to beet you.

52:07.336 --> 52:09.861
That's a radish.

52:31.493 --> 52:35.862
That was the only way
to communicate with the machine.

52:36.265 --> 52:37.994
What exactly did you order?

52:38.167 --> 52:42.160
A Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.

52:44.239 --> 52:47.731
Jellybean. Watermelon.
Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.

52:47.910 --> 52:53.974
Cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad.
Strawberry. Marshmallow.

52:55.918 --> 52:57.112
Strawberry.

53:02.090 --> 53:04.581
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

53:11.266 --> 53:13.427
Help, somebody.

53:13.735 --> 53:15.669
Help me, please.

53:15.838 --> 53:17.601
It's my son.

53:18.240 --> 53:19.605
We need a doctor.

53:19.775 --> 53:22.608
Is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?

53:22.778 --> 53:24.678
I am a doctor.

53:24.847 --> 53:25.871
You are?

53:26.048 --> 53:28.710
I was, back in Guatemala.

53:28.884 --> 53:30.818
I came here for a better life.

53:30.986 --> 53:32.180
Pretty great decision, eh?

53:37.359 --> 53:38.690
How is he, doc?

53:40.762 --> 53:42.059
He's in a food coma.

53:43.599 --> 53:45.123
Too much junk food.

53:45.300 --> 53:46.631
I need a celery, stat.

53:46.802 --> 53:48.531
Here you go.

53:51.940 --> 53:55.273
- Daddy?
- Oh, Cal. Cal.

53:55.444 --> 53:57.912
I love you, son.

54:01.483 --> 54:03.542
Looks like everything
turned out okay.

54:03.719 --> 54:04.845
Not yet, it hasn't.

54:05.020 --> 54:08.387
That twister was an amuse-bouche
compared to what's on the way.

54:08.557 --> 54:11.082
- What's an amuse-bouche?
- Manny, patch us through.

54:17.332 --> 54:18.492
Go.

54:18.667 --> 54:21.534
Cute report, Nancy.
Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.

54:21.703 --> 54:22.829
Can it, Patrick.

54:23.005 --> 54:26.338
We are about to be in the epicenter
of a perfect food storm.

54:26.508 --> 54:28.669
It's going to spread
across the globe.

54:29.144 --> 54:32.511
I've calculated the Coriolis
acceleration of the storm system.

54:32.681 --> 54:34.740
First, it'll hit New York...

54:34.917 --> 54:36.942
...then Paris...

54:37.119 --> 54:40.020
...then the Jiayuguan Pass
in eastern China.

54:40.188 --> 54:45.990
And in four hours the entire northern
hemisphere will be one big potluck.

55:11.219 --> 55:12.686
Flint?

55:20.896 --> 55:22.227
Flint?

55:22.397 --> 55:23.455
Hey, Dad.

55:24.166 --> 55:25.758
What are you doing?

55:25.934 --> 55:28.596
Well, I tried to help everybody...

55:28.770 --> 55:32.729
...but instead I ruined everything.

55:33.308 --> 55:35.333
I'm just a piece of junk.

55:35.510 --> 55:39.446
So I threw myself away.

55:39.881 --> 55:43.282
Along with all these
dumb inventions.

55:43.452 --> 55:45.317
This is junk.

55:46.054 --> 55:48.147
This is junk.

55:50.559 --> 55:52.151
This is junk.

55:53.028 --> 55:56.862
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is,
when it's listing...

55:57.032 --> 55:59.500
...and if it's not running,
you know-

55:59.668 --> 56:01.898
Don't worry, Dad, I get it.

56:02.070 --> 56:04.538
Mom was wrong about me.

56:05.607 --> 56:07.598
I'm not an inventor.

56:08.744 --> 56:11.178
I should've just quit when you said.

56:18.820 --> 56:20.253
Well...

56:21.156 --> 56:24.887
...when it rains, you put on a coat.

56:25.293 --> 56:29.923
Dad, you know I don't understand
fishing metapho-

56:32.000 --> 56:33.024
What?

56:37.139 --> 56:38.197
My coat.

56:48.717 --> 56:53.017
Come on, Steve.
We've got diem to carpe.

56:59.761 --> 57:01.023
Kill code downloading.

57:03.532 --> 57:05.898
Redesigning. Virtualizing.

57:06.068 --> 57:07.660
Cutting.

57:08.336 --> 57:10.827
Welding. Forging.

57:11.006 --> 57:12.906
- Wiring.
- Helping.

57:13.075 --> 57:14.702
Testing.

57:15.911 --> 57:17.845
Yes.

57:21.283 --> 57:23.513
Flying Car 2.

57:23.685 --> 57:26.381
Now with wings.

57:36.932 --> 57:39.958
Hey, I had a weird dream
like this once.

57:40.402 --> 57:42.962
I have a macaroni
on my head.

57:44.306 --> 57:45.830
Run.

57:51.179 --> 57:52.305
No school!

57:57.385 --> 58:01.549
Still nothing, nothing in the bottom of
the third inning.

58:09.464 --> 58:10.658
Everyone.

58:12.734 --> 58:14.759
I want to apologize.

58:16.238 --> 58:18.263
Especially to you, Sam.

58:18.440 --> 58:20.567
But I have a plan.

58:20.742 --> 58:23.176
This flash drive contains a kill code.

58:23.345 --> 58:26.678
I will fly up into that food storm,
plug it into the machine...

58:26.848 --> 58:28.782
...and shut it down forever...

58:28.950 --> 58:31.316
...while you guys evacuate
the island, using brea-

58:31.486 --> 58:33.283
This is all his fault. Get him.

58:33.455 --> 58:34.479
There he is! Get him!

58:34.656 --> 58:35.680
Get Flint.

58:35.857 --> 58:38.951
Let's rock his car back and forth.

58:43.832 --> 58:45.800
Hey!

58:46.334 --> 58:49.235
This mess we're in
is all our faults.

58:50.705 --> 58:53.572
Me, I didn't even protect
my own son.

58:53.742 --> 58:56.210
Look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.

58:56.378 --> 59:00.712
In fact, when he gets out of that car,
I'm gonna slap him in the face.

59:00.882 --> 59:04.978
I know Flint Lockwood made the food,
but it was made-to-order.

59:05.153 --> 59:08.020
And now it's time for all of us
to pay the bill.

59:18.633 --> 59:20.464
Thank you, Earl.

59:21.670 --> 59:23.331
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

59:23.505 --> 59:27.498
- Let's go build some boats.
- Yeah.

59:28.043 --> 59:29.840
I'm gonna go build a boat.

59:31.446 --> 59:32.470
I'm coming with you.

59:33.415 --> 59:36.748
You're gonna need someone
to navigate you through that storm.

59:37.719 --> 59:39.152
I can't let you do this alone.

59:39.321 --> 59:42.051
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
- Are you kidding?

59:42.224 --> 59:44.055
- Well, I just thought that we-
- No.

59:44.226 --> 59:45.250
Okay.

59:45.427 --> 59:48.191
- You are going to need a copilot.
- You're a pilot too?

59:48.630 --> 59:51.064
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.

59:51.233 --> 59:53.292
- Really?
- No, that was a joke.

59:53.468 --> 59:54.492
I am also a comedian.

59:57.005 --> 59:59.872
- Let's do this thing.
- I'm coming too.

01:00:00.041 --> 01:00:02.134
Brent, that's okay.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:05.404
No, it's not okay.

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.209
I've been coasting on my fame
since I was a baby.

01:00:09.384 --> 01:00:12.285
But it was all just an illusion.

01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:16.550
Maybe up there
I'll find out who I really am.

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:19.920
The car's pretty full, so...

01:00:21.062 --> 01:00:22.495
Yeah.

01:00:22.664 --> 01:00:23.790
Brent.

01:00:23.965 --> 01:00:25.694
Okay.

01:00:38.246 --> 01:00:40.077
Good luck, son.

01:00:47.522 --> 01:00:49.922
Steve.

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:52.624
Pea-soup fog.

01:00:52.794 --> 01:00:55.354
Manny, hit the wipers.

01:00:58.199 --> 01:01:01.635
There's massive gastro-precipitation
accumulated around the machine.

01:01:03.004 --> 01:01:04.869
It's almost as if it's...

01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:08.505
Inside a giant meatball.

01:01:12.614 --> 01:01:14.741
Water goes in the top...

01:01:14.916 --> 01:01:18.818
...a food hurricane
comes out the bottom.

01:01:19.254 --> 01:01:21.119
Glad I'm wearing a diaper.

01:01:37.839 --> 01:01:40.034
Anybody order pizza?

01:01:40.475 --> 01:01:42.500
Hold on.

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:44.611
The pizza's chasing us?

01:01:44.779 --> 01:01:46.679
Sentient food? That's impossible.

01:01:46.848 --> 01:01:49.783
Unless its molecular structure's
mutated into super food!

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:53.352
That's been genetically engineered
to protect the FLDSMDFR.

01:01:53.521 --> 01:01:55.216
Pizza.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:57.620
Pizza. Pizza. Pizza.

01:02:00.695 --> 01:02:05.029
That was close. I mean, can you
imagine if we lost this kill code?

01:02:11.639 --> 01:02:12.901
- Tim's Tackle Shop.
- Dad.

01:02:13.074 --> 01:02:14.735
You're okay, great.

01:02:14.909 --> 01:02:17.434
I need a favor. The fate of the world
depends on it!

01:02:17.612 --> 01:02:19.671
Okay, then, skipper.
What do you need?

01:02:19.848 --> 01:02:24.080
Go into my lab, get on my computer
and e-mail a file to my cell phone.

01:02:31.659 --> 01:02:32.683
All right.

01:02:38.066 --> 01:02:40.057
- Want me to drive?
- Yeah, okay.

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:54.949
You're a lot better than me.

01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:02.215
Okay, here's the plan:

01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:05.188
Sam and I will enter the meateroid
through the intake here...

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.692
...which should lead us straight
to the FLDSMDFR.

01:03:07.862 --> 01:03:10.592
Manny, you and Steve stay on the
plane. Don't spray that.

01:03:10.765 --> 01:03:13.825
Once my dad e-mails me the kill code,
we'll destroy the machine...

01:03:14.002 --> 01:03:16.300
...and rendezvous
at the western blowhole in-

01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:18.996
- How long until the world's destroyed?
- Twenty minutes.

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:20.198
Just before then.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:23.208
What about me, Brent?
What do I do?

01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:27.578
You can be president
of the back seat.

01:03:29.384 --> 01:03:30.442
Deploy hatch.

01:03:30.618 --> 01:03:33.815
Car upside down, go.

01:03:35.256 --> 01:03:37.087
Ladies first?

01:03:37.559 --> 01:03:39.049
No?

01:03:39.227 --> 01:03:40.660
All right.

01:03:41.763 --> 01:03:43.890
Wait for me.

01:03:44.065 --> 01:03:46.090
Great. Okay, I'm good.

01:03:48.436 --> 01:03:52.338
As long as we stay on course,
it should be a straight shot to the-

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:56.271
Yeah!

01:03:59.647 --> 01:04:01.672
We're a team.

01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:16.797
We've landed here
in some kind of exhaust vent.

01:04:16.965 --> 01:04:20.867
If we go this way, the Flamidabager
should be right down this air shaft.

01:04:21.035 --> 01:04:22.764
Brent, get out of that pie.

01:04:22.937 --> 01:04:24.165
What's that?

01:04:37.352 --> 01:04:39.115
Oh, boy.

01:04:46.161 --> 01:04:48.493
Welcome, Flint.

01:04:57.672 --> 01:04:59.697
That's fry oil.

01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:07.780
Flint, you have a call.

01:05:07.949 --> 01:05:09.177
Flint, you have a-

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:10.874
Dad. Oh, okay, great.

01:05:11.052 --> 01:05:13.816
On the screen there's a file
marked "kill code. "

01:05:13.988 --> 01:05:16.650
- Wha-?
- Move that into my e-mail window...

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:19.889
...type in my name, and press send.

01:05:22.363 --> 01:05:23.387
- Window?
- Okay, Dad...

01:05:23.565 --> 01:05:26.557
...you see the thing that looks like
a little piece of paper?

01:05:26.734 --> 01:05:28.224
Use the mouse to drag it.

01:05:28.436 --> 01:05:30.404
- Drag it? Drag it.
- Drag it. Drag it.

01:05:30.605 --> 01:05:33.096
Right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.

01:05:33.274 --> 01:05:34.673
It's not dragging.

01:05:34.842 --> 01:05:36.867
Drag it across the desktop.

01:05:39.814 --> 01:05:42.942
- That didn't do anything.
- Of course it didn't! You know what?

01:05:47.088 --> 01:05:48.112
Go, go, go.

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:50.553
Hoist those sails. Toast that bread.

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:52.756
We are running out of time.

01:05:56.431 --> 01:05:58.490
Let's move out. Go, go, go.

01:05:58.666 --> 01:06:00.497
We can do it.
Come on, move it, move it.

01:06:00.668 --> 01:06:04.001
Good job. That's what I'm talking
about. Everybody head to the docks.

01:06:10.945 --> 01:06:12.276
Wait, wait.

01:06:12.447 --> 01:06:14.915
I have an important announcement.

01:06:16.484 --> 01:06:17.781
See you, suckers.

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:19.985
Bon voyage.

01:06:20.855 --> 01:06:23.653
And bon appétit.

01:06:31.633 --> 01:06:34.067
- Cal.
- Calvin.

01:06:43.544 --> 01:06:45.171
Cal, get back here.

01:06:51.519 --> 01:06:54.147
- Foodalanche.
- Cal.

01:06:54.322 --> 01:06:55.983
I'm not gonna lose you again.

01:06:56.157 --> 01:06:57.886
Baby.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.525
Hold on tight, Calvin.

01:07:37.198 --> 01:07:41.225
Everybody head south.
We gotta stay ahead of that storm.

01:07:44.305 --> 01:07:45.897
- Now what?
- Just click "send. "

01:07:46.074 --> 01:07:48.508
Flint, the Fliminadifiserser's
right down there!

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:52.009
- Dad, hurry.
- Send. Send.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.545
Oh, wait.

01:07:56.751 --> 01:07:58.719
Dad? Dad? Can you hear me?

01:07:59.287 --> 01:08:00.948
Dad?

01:08:01.489 --> 01:08:02.683
Hey, guys?

01:08:07.929 --> 01:08:10.762
Holy crap balls.

01:08:11.199 --> 01:08:12.962
Go, go, go.

01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:21.608
I don't know.
I think they're kind of cute.

01:08:21.776 --> 01:08:24.040
I mean, this one just walked
right up to me and-

01:08:24.212 --> 01:08:25.736
He's got me!

01:08:27.682 --> 01:08:29.343
- They ate Brent.
- They ate Brent.

01:08:30.484 --> 01:08:34.421
Dad, I'm surrounded
by man-eating chickens right now.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:36.787
So if this is goodbye...

01:08:38.225 --> 01:08:40.591
...thanks for trying
to set me straight.

01:08:41.129 --> 01:08:43.723
Figured it out a little late, I guess.

01:08:44.732 --> 01:08:46.323
Okay, bye.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:06.111
Dad.

01:09:07.822 --> 01:09:10.551
Hey, give me that phone back.

01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:29.903
Baby Brent?

01:09:30.077 --> 01:09:33.103
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.

01:09:33.281 --> 01:09:36.078
I'm Chicken Brent.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.185
And I'm finally contributing
to society.

01:09:40.354 --> 01:09:42.185
Crotch kick.

01:09:48.261 --> 01:09:52.493
Now go, you crazy kids,
and save the world.

01:09:52.667 --> 01:09:55.329
You did it, Chicken Brent.
You really did it.

01:09:55.503 --> 01:09:57.471
Go, go, go.

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.631
It should be right down this hole.

01:10:04.111 --> 01:10:05.135
That's peanut brittle.

01:10:06.948 --> 01:10:10.384
If either one of us touches it,
we'll go into anaphylactic shock.

01:10:10.852 --> 01:10:13.286
Actually, I'm not entirely allergic
to peanuts.

01:10:13.454 --> 01:10:17.151
I might have just said that
to get you to like me.

01:10:17.325 --> 01:10:21.489
So you really thought having allergies
would make you more attractive?

01:10:25.032 --> 01:10:26.897
Mustache.

01:10:27.068 --> 01:10:28.695
Mus-

01:10:37.144 --> 01:10:39.635
- Sesame bagel.
- Hey, taxi.

01:10:39.814 --> 01:10:41.645
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:44.478
I asked for extra mustard.

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:52.926
I was right.

01:11:02.270 --> 01:11:03.498
Hot tea?

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:05.696
Did he say hot tea?

01:11:07.008 --> 01:11:10.637
"You are about to be crushed
by a giant corn. "

01:11:10.811 --> 01:11:12.472
Run.

01:11:14.615 --> 01:11:17.516
It looks like the food storm
is following an unusual pattern...

01:11:17.685 --> 01:11:20.017
...of hitting the world's
famous landmarks first...

01:11:20.187 --> 01:11:23.315
...and is now spreading
to the rest of the globe.

01:11:24.959 --> 01:11:26.051
What the what?

01:11:26.227 --> 01:11:28.752
Hurry up, guys.

01:11:28.963 --> 01:11:31.761
After I plug my phone into
the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...

01:11:31.933 --> 01:11:35.699
...I'll tug on the licorice twice
and you'll pull me back up, okay?

01:11:36.103 --> 01:11:37.798
Sounds great.

01:11:48.282 --> 01:11:49.544
Oh, no.

01:11:54.589 --> 01:11:55.954
You got cut, didn't you?

01:11:57.325 --> 01:11:59.088
It's just a scratch.

01:12:00.261 --> 01:12:03.958
Brent, you need to take Sam back to
the plane to get her an allergy shot.

01:12:04.131 --> 01:12:05.291
Just a second.

01:12:05.466 --> 01:12:06.728
What? No.

01:12:07.201 --> 01:12:10.261
- Let go, Sam.
- I'm not gonna let you go.

01:12:10.438 --> 01:12:13.305
Flint, you'll be stuck down there.

01:12:13.474 --> 01:12:15.635
It's not ideal, no.

01:12:16.243 --> 01:12:18.643
Come with us. We'll start over.

01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:22.249
We'll live underground.
Use bacon for clothes.

01:12:22.416 --> 01:12:24.179
Sam, that's not a very good plan.

01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:26.980
It is if it means
I don't have to lose you.

01:12:27.755 --> 01:12:30.087
Look, I like you, okay?

01:12:31.559 --> 01:12:34.289
Like- Like, as a friend?

01:12:34.462 --> 01:12:36.259
No.

01:12:36.464 --> 01:12:39.126
Like, "like you" like you.

01:12:41.836 --> 01:12:43.531
Me too.

01:12:45.206 --> 01:12:47.197
But about you.

01:12:52.613 --> 01:12:53.671
Goodbye, Sam.

01:12:53.848 --> 01:12:56.373
Flint. No.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:57.812
Hang on, Sam.

01:12:57.985 --> 01:13:00.886
Dr. Manny's got the medicine
for your face.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.021
Pickles.

01:13:09.497 --> 01:13:10.691
Beets.

01:13:10.865 --> 01:13:13.265
Banana.

01:13:13.434 --> 01:13:16.130
Strawberry.

01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:30.384
- Manny, we're on our way. Hurry.
- Hang on, Sam.

01:13:30.551 --> 01:13:32.917
I'm circling the blowhole.

01:13:36.824 --> 01:13:37.848
Scared.

01:13:49.003 --> 01:13:50.027
Gummi Bears.

01:13:50.204 --> 01:13:52.695
Play with us, play with us.
Eat us, eat us.

01:13:53.841 --> 01:13:55.206
Hungry.

01:13:55.976 --> 01:13:59.173
Hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears.
Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.

01:13:59.346 --> 01:14:01.405
Steve starving. Hungry.
Hungry. Starving.

01:14:08.122 --> 01:14:10.283
Manny. Where are you?

01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:36.308
- She touched a peanut or something.
- Oh, boy.

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:48.118
Corn.

01:15:22.730 --> 01:15:23.754
Grabbing.

01:15:24.298 --> 01:15:26.266
Tying. Throwing.

01:15:29.236 --> 01:15:31.033
Waiting.

01:15:33.107 --> 01:15:34.131
Swinging.

01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:46.217
Sorry, old friend.
The kitchen's closed.

01:15:50.925 --> 01:15:51.949
Fight the power!

01:15:52.359 --> 01:15:53.451
Dad.

01:15:53.627 --> 01:15:54.821
No.

01:16:35.836 --> 01:16:40.205
When it rains, you put on a coat...

01:16:40.374 --> 01:16:42.399
...of Spray-On Shoes.

01:16:44.745 --> 01:16:47.407
Yeah.

01:17:02.263 --> 01:17:04.925
Just- There were chickens-

01:17:05.099 --> 01:17:06.191
Where's Flint?

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:11.497
No!

01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:13.834
I know, kid.

01:17:14.008 --> 01:17:15.270
I know.

01:17:24.485 --> 01:17:26.749
- Cool.
- Yeah. All right.

01:18:04.525 --> 01:18:05.856
Flint?

01:18:09.029 --> 01:18:10.428
I'm sorry.

01:18:28.849 --> 01:18:31.579
Your son was a great man.

01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:59.574
- Steve.
- Steve.

01:18:59.747 --> 01:19:01.408
- Flint.
- Brent.

01:19:01.582 --> 01:19:03.140
- Flint.
- Cal.

01:19:03.317 --> 01:19:04.409
- Steve.
- Flint.

01:19:04.585 --> 01:19:05.813
- Earl.
- Flint.

01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:08.318
- You guy.
- Steve.

01:19:10.691 --> 01:19:11.919
Sam.

01:19:12.092 --> 01:19:13.252
Flint.

01:19:14.228 --> 01:19:15.320
Sam.

01:19:15.496 --> 01:19:17.191
- Flint.
- Flint.

01:19:17.364 --> 01:19:18.695
- Dad.
- Steve.

01:19:18.866 --> 01:19:20.663
Flint.

01:19:24.505 --> 01:19:28.464
Look, when you-
When you cast your line...

01:19:28.642 --> 01:19:32.442
...if it's not straight-

01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:35.375
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:19:39.219 --> 01:19:41.084
I'm proud of you, Flint.

01:19:41.655 --> 01:19:44.283
I'm amazed that someone
as ordinary as me...

01:19:44.458 --> 01:19:48.519
...could be the father of someone
as extraordinary as you.

01:19:48.695 --> 01:19:51.994
You're talented,
you're a total original.

01:19:52.166 --> 01:19:54.999
And your lab is breathtaking.

01:19:55.169 --> 01:19:58.161
Your mom, she always knew
you were going to be special.

01:19:58.338 --> 01:20:01.432
And if she were alive today,
she'd tell us both:

01:20:01.608 --> 01:20:03.769
"I told you so. "

01:20:04.711 --> 01:20:07.805
Now, look,
when I take this thing off...

01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:11.439
...and you hear me
make a fishing metaphor...

01:20:12.219 --> 01:20:15.120
...just know
that fishing metaphor means:

01:20:15.289 --> 01:20:17.120
I love my son.

01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:19.589
I love you too, Dad.

01:20:30.671 --> 01:20:32.536
So where were we?

01:20:32.706 --> 01:20:34.503
You were about to kiss me.

01:20:34.675 --> 01:20:36.700
Were you gonna kiss me back?

01:20:36.877 --> 01:20:38.367
Why don't you find out?

01:20:38.545 --> 01:20:41.446
Because I don't want to go for it and
then get shut down again.

01:20:41.615 --> 01:20:43.378
- Just kiss me.
- You know-

01:20:53.327 --> 01:20:56.524
Yeah. I'm a chicken.

01:21:14.481 --> 01:21:18.281
This was not well thought out.
