00:02.417 --> 00:04.959
Are you guys opening
another bar?

00:04.959 --> 00:05.876
-Yeah.
-Yes.

00:05.876 --> 00:07.042
What's the name?

00:07.042 --> 00:07.959
We're still working on the name.

00:07.959 --> 00:09.083
Schwartz and Sandy's.

00:09.083 --> 00:10.459
-You're weak.
-Now hold on a second.

00:10.459 --> 00:11.375
-I'm weak.
-If he--If he--

00:11.375 --> 00:12.667
-You are, you weak man.
-If he wants to--

00:12.667 --> 00:14.042
-You see this?
-That is rude.

00:14.042 --> 00:15.709
-He's being weak, Lisa.
-I'm being weak?

00:15.709 --> 00:16.792
No, no, he's not just weak.
He's drawing the line--

00:16.792 --> 00:19.167
I can feel his wussy energy
spewing off of him.

00:19.167 --> 00:20.417
You might not be
a drunken asshole,

00:20.417 --> 00:22.417
but you're still acting
like an asshole.

00:22.417 --> 00:24.125
My son was born when I was 20.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.417
-Oh, wow.
-Wow.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.459
Me and my ex--
we had two beautiful kids.

00:27.459 --> 00:29.000
When is the last time
you've seen 'em?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.209
Well, what, four years back?

00:31.209 --> 00:32.459
He did pull me aside

00:32.459 --> 00:34.876
and talk to me about
some pretty intense things.

00:34.876 --> 00:36.959
What did he tell you?

00:36.959 --> 00:40.209
She slammed him with
a domestic violence charge.

-Diva baby.
-No.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.000
Little princess.

Our little baby.

She, like, really fights
the eyes closing.

01:29.042 --> 01:32.542
Ocean's little personality
is all Randall.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.334
Can I tell you sometimes
what I do?

01:34.334 --> 01:36.626
-Yeah.
-I take her out into the sun.

01:36.626 --> 01:40.000
And I put the sun right in
her eyes, and then she's like...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.209
What do you mean, you just take
her out there and let the sun...

01:42.209 --> 01:44.209
Yeah, because then
she realizes, like,

01:44.209 --> 01:46.000
"Oh, it feels nice
to close my eyes."

01:46.000 --> 01:50.667
She feels like she's missing out
on things, and she's not.

01:50.667 --> 01:54.000
That's exactly how Randall is.
It's like, go to sleep.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.584
Nothing cool is happening.
I promise.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.918
So I missed boys' night
this weekend

01:58.918 --> 02:00.417
'cause I was working.
-Yeah. Yeah.

02:00.417 --> 02:01.918
So I decided to put together

02:01.918 --> 02:03.501
a little poker night
for everybody.

02:03.501 --> 02:06.000
Unlimited re-entry
'cause you know my nickname.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.626
-"Rebuy" Randall.
-Exactly.

02:08.626 --> 02:10.959
So I'm thinking of inviting
Brock because, you know,

02:10.959 --> 02:12.209
I don't wanna--
-To the poker game?

02:12.209 --> 02:13.501
Yeah, I don't wanna
leave him out.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.042
-[Ocean crying]
-Oh, my God. Look at this.

02:16.042 --> 02:19.000
And we're dancing. This is what
I have to do with her, Randall.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.667
You know, obviously, I had
a conversation at Belmont

02:21.667 --> 02:24.542
when you dipped out early.
-Mm.

02:24.542 --> 02:28.167
Brock sat down next to me,
and he was just kind of, like,

02:28.167 --> 02:31.417
a, like, spew of all
of these things.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.417
Like, what is it called
when someone--

02:33.417 --> 02:35.042
a restraining order.

02:35.042 --> 02:38.834
The baby mama put
a restraining order on him.

02:38.834 --> 02:41.000
I'm sorry. Why are we just
shrugging off

02:41.000 --> 02:42.751
the domestic violence thing,
but, like...

02:42.751 --> 02:44.042
-But Scheana--Scheana--Scheana--
-Why are we shrugging that off?

02:44.042 --> 02:45.125
-Yeah, I know, but she--Yeah.
-That's a kind of big deal.

02:45.125 --> 02:46.042
-Why are we--it feels like
a red herring fallacy.

02:46.042 --> 02:48.167
But isn't that between
Scheana and Brock?

02:48.167 --> 02:49.292
And they've communicated this
to each other.

02:49.292 --> 02:50.876
-She's aware of it.
-Yeah, but, like, the main thing

02:50.876 --> 02:52.042
is Lala heard that.
That freaked her out

02:52.042 --> 02:53.751
as it would anybody.
-Yeah.

02:53.751 --> 02:54.918
You think she might have just
brushed over it

02:54.918 --> 02:58.167
'cause she's so happily in love
and just had a kid?

02:58.167 --> 03:00.209
Yeah, that's kind of how
she does.

03:00.209 --> 03:03.083
You know, he literally flipped,

03:03.083 --> 03:08.083
crying, like, "Don't you talk
about my family! My kids!"

03:08.083 --> 03:10.083
[crying] The one thing--
it's my ----ing family.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.459
-Yeah.
-I know, dude.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.667
-I know, man.
-Come at them, I'll kill ya.

03:12.667 --> 03:13.459
I don't know how
young Brock was either,

03:13.459 --> 03:14.918
when he had the kids, too,

03:14.918 --> 03:17.876
but he probably was younger
than he is now.

03:17.876 --> 03:19.459
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

03:19.459 --> 03:22.167
You know how close
Scheana and I have gotten.

03:22.167 --> 03:26.292
Clearly, life isn't everything
she portrays on her vlog.

03:30.918 --> 03:33.709
Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to my channel.

03:33.709 --> 03:38.167
We are doing a cooking
with Brock vlog today.

03:38.167 --> 03:40.000
By popular demand.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.209
I'm making an apple pie,

03:41.209 --> 03:43.042
and we're making an apple pie
with crumble on top, too,

03:43.042 --> 03:44.542
'cause that's what makes it
over 2 pounds.

03:44.542 --> 03:45.834
So it's like a French apple
or a Dutch apple.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.209
I don't know the difference.
Comment below

03:48.209 --> 03:49.292
and let me know if you know
the difference

03:49.292 --> 03:52.542
between a French apple pie
and a Dutch apple pie.

03:52.542 --> 03:56.167
My track record doesn't help
my current situation,

03:56.167 --> 03:59.918
and it's frustrating because
Brock is the real deal.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.959
Your man is back here
to teach you guys

04:01.959 --> 04:03.751
how to bake a cake
for everybody.

04:03.751 --> 04:05.626
-It's a pie.
-It's a pie.

04:05.626 --> 04:09.876
So I'm using YouTube and vlogs
to show a deeper insight

04:09.876 --> 04:12.042
into our relationship.

04:12.042 --> 04:14.375
Let's get cookin'!

04:14.375 --> 04:16.042
I just wanna be able
to show people

04:16.042 --> 04:19.626
the true, authentic version of
myself, completely unedited...

04:19.626 --> 04:21.959
-Over here, honey. So, first--
-But that's my bad side.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.292
Oh.

04:23.292 --> 04:25.876
...except by me.

04:25.876 --> 04:28.417
One cup of cubed butter,
all-purpose flour,

04:28.417 --> 04:30.417
nothing too crazy here.
Thin, little slices.

04:30.417 --> 04:33.959
Make the pie crust by combining
the flour, salt

04:33.959 --> 04:35.209
into a large bowl.

04:35.209 --> 04:36.667
So this is our rolling pin

04:36.667 --> 04:39.250
because our rolling pin
is in San Diego.

04:39.250 --> 04:42.459
-Here's the apples, baby.
-Ohh, okay. That's it.

04:42.459 --> 04:45.042
Mom's gonna exist stage left.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.000
I turned the camera off,

04:46.000 --> 04:47.167
so you're just talking
to yourself now.

04:47.167 --> 04:50.501
Perfect. Sounds--Sounds normal.

04:50.501 --> 04:52.751
I go over to Lisa's,
and Scheana's there.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.626
Lisa said, "What are you
concerned about?"

04:55.626 --> 04:57.834
And I said, "Well, originally,
it was the two children

04:57.834 --> 05:01.792
that were left behind, but now
domestic violence charges."

05:01.792 --> 05:05.792
I would hope that if I were
in Scheana's shoes,

05:05.792 --> 05:08.000
that she would come to me
and just say, like,

05:08.000 --> 05:09.751
"I-I want you to be smart."

05:09.751 --> 05:12.751
Unfortunately, you have
some explaining to do

05:12.751 --> 05:16.083
because of the way
Lala presented the situation.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.834
It was like Lisa felt like
I was hiding something.

05:19.834 --> 05:20.959
But you look up to Lisa.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.000
I don't want her to think less
of our relationship

05:23.000 --> 05:25.459
because Lala wants to throw that
over the table.

05:25.459 --> 05:28.042
So are you going to explain
what the order is?

Yeah, I'll--I will,
because you know what?

05:30.000 --> 05:33.042
I feel like if people wanna
know me and are into me,

05:33.042 --> 05:38.083

not gonna get working with Lisa.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.209
It might get washed out
every time you open up the door.

06:42.209 --> 06:45.042
It's gonna shed light in here,
then it's gonna wash it out.

06:45.042 --> 06:47.292
What we do is we put
a light strip in there.

06:47.292 --> 06:51.000
It's just gonna barely hit
that side right there.

I want light, drama on corners.

I think...it's gonna be...

-Schwartz and Sandy's.
-No, I want him to say it

'cause he can't even get it
out of his mouth.

07:30.292 --> 07:32.250

I'm falling in love with it.

Since James is sober,

25:33.417 --> 25:35.000
and he's never really
played poker,

25:35.000 --> 25:36.626
to level the playing field,

25:36.626 --> 25:38.417
we should all have to take
one shot, maybe two.

25:38.417 --> 25:40.083
-Or is that too much?
-That's too much.

James, here's my pro tip.

28:07.876 --> 28:10.542
If you have any decent cards
right now,

28:10.542 --> 28:13.334
you should definitely go
all in, too,

28:13.334 --> 28:15.584
because Randall hasn't even seen
his cards.

28:15.584 --> 28:18.167

28:18.167 --> 28:19.626

What? You guys are crazy

-I got it. I got it. I got it.

Okay, but why? Because, well,
he couldn't see his kids,

29:28.918 --> 29:30.209
so he just wasn't gonna pay
child support.

29:30.209 --> 29:31.167

I was gonna give it to Brock,

but he was already gone.
-Oh. Yeah.

31:07.834 --> 31:09.751
-I heard he was--
-Well, 'cause I texted him,

31:09.751 --> 31:13.209
and I was just like, "Why did
you..." Again, no offense.

31:13.209 --> 31:15.250
I'm not offended.
I thought it was strange, too.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.709
I was just like, "Why the
[bleep] would you say that?"

31:16.709 --> 31:18.209
I also was confused.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.042
Because he didn't explain
the whole situation.

31:20.042 --> 31:23.459
He just gave a highlight
of something that you then

31:23.459 --> 31:26.042
took as he probably beat up
his wife.

31:26.042 --> 31:28.375
I stand by the fact
I am not coming for you.

31:28.375 --> 31:31.584
And I understand,
but I just wish that

31:31.584 --> 31:34.626
you would trust my judgment
and know that I'm not going to

31:34.626 --> 31:38.959
have a baby with someone who I
think is a terrible person.

31:38.959 --> 31:42.000
But what's more frustrating
for me, honestly, Lala,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.167
is why wasn't this
a concern of yours

31:45.167 --> 31:47.083
the first year
Brock and I were together?

31:47.083 --> 31:48.626
I didn't know about it

31:48.626 --> 31:50.083
the first year you and Brock
were together.

31:50.083 --> 31:52.167
You didn't know that he had
two kids?

31:52.167 --> 31:54.459
When I hear someone
has two kids, fine.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.334
Randall has two kids.
I thought, great.

31:56.334 --> 31:59.667
I finally have a friend that
knows what it's gonna be like

31:59.667 --> 32:01.417
to step up as
a ----ing stepmother.

32:01.417 --> 32:04.209
That's what I thought,
and then you drop it

32:04.209 --> 32:06.209
that "I haven't seen my kids
in four years,"

32:06.209 --> 32:09.334
and you just want that to be
like, "Oh. No big deal."

32:09.334 --> 32:11.709
But Ariana, Raquel, and Charli
all know that.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.042

42:12.042 --> 42:13.542
-I know.
-And they try to, like, make me

42:13.542 --> 42:15.876
like this villain,
and it's, like, enough already.

42:15.876 --> 42:18.167
Like, how is this happening?

42:18.167 --> 42:21.834
♪♪♪

42:21.834 --> 42:23.876
Well, that was fun.

42:23.876 --> 42:30.542
♪♪♪

42:30.542 --> 42:33.417
Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:33.417 --> 42:35.542
We're miners.
We're mining for gold,

42:35.542 --> 42:37.125
our little nuggets of wisdom
and inspiration.

42:37.125 --> 42:40.125
-[muttering]
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:40.125 --> 42:42.459
You know what I mean?
"Schwartz and Sandy's offers

42:42.459 --> 42:45.250
a seat on a flight
of the imagination."

42:45.250 --> 42:47.792
[laughs] Ha!
My dick's getting hard.

42:47.792 --> 42:49.209
Tom started the yelling.

42:49.209 --> 42:53.167
That behavior was
completely unacceptable.

42:53.167 --> 42:55.125
That's one of the things
I like about him is that he--

42:55.125 --> 42:58.334
He has a thing with kind of
attacking women verbally.

42:58.334 --> 43:01.626
It felt a little
double standard-ish.

43:01.626 --> 43:05.626
Guess who ----ing had a problem
with that. Me.
