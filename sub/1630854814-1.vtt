02:37.157 --> 02:38.636
Hi!

02:38.680 --> 02:39.985
Hey!ALICE: Sorry I'm late.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.944
No!ALICE: Rude.

02:41.987 --> 02:43.946
I'm so sorry.No, it's fine.

02:43.989 --> 02:45.817
It's fine.WAITER: Ladies.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.080
Hey.Hey.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.473
Um, we'll have

02:49.517 --> 02:51.475
a bottle of the chardonnay

02:51.519 --> 02:52.911
and three glasses,
please.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.739
Sure.ALICE: Oh, no. Actually,

02:54.783 --> 02:55.914
a vodka soda for me,
thank you.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.268
Uh, the waiter's
in love with you.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.488
I mean, I really feel like
he does not know

03:04.532 --> 03:06.621
the definition
of the word "boundaries."

03:06.664 --> 03:09.014
Yeah, because he sent you,
like, 14 dick pics.

03:09.058 --> 03:12.496
Oh, and... he waxes.

03:12.540 --> 03:13.932
Wow.SOPHIE: Yeah.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.847
No!Like, the whole...

03:15.891 --> 03:18.110
Really? But why?

03:18.154 --> 03:19.460
I don't know.

03:20.678 --> 03:23.377
Oh. Alice's guy
from the swim team?

03:23.420 --> 03:25.117
Okay, we don't have
to talk about Dolphin Dave.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.816
I want to have a nice night,
thank you very much.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.818
Like, I don't think
that shaving
his body hair was

03:29.861 --> 03:31.472
gonna make the difference
between Olympic trials

03:31.515 --> 03:32.473
or not.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.605
Oh, God.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.694
Sorry.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.262
Okay.Thank you.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.221
Oh, thank you!You're very welcome.

03:41.830 --> 03:42.874
Sophie.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.180
The bottle.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.098
And vodka soda.

03:49.403 --> 03:50.665
Oh.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.797
Yeah, you're
welcome.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.495
He's obsessed
with you.Sophie, stop.

03:54.538 --> 03:55.931
You don't see it?
Don't tell me
you don't see it.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.498
I have a boyfriend.

03:57.541 --> 03:58.977
Sophie, leave her alone.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.675
Yes, thank you.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.504
Sorry, it's
just Simon.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.897
Um, actually, he has
a gallery opening on Friday,

04:05.941 --> 04:08.335
he wanted me to invite
both of you guys.Oh!

04:08.378 --> 04:09.858
That'd be great.
That... Yeah. Yeah?

04:09.901 --> 04:10.902
Yeah?

04:11.729 --> 04:12.817
Yeah, definitely.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.254
I just know there's, like...

04:14.297 --> 04:16.604
collectors coming
and so he was saying

04:16.647 --> 04:18.258
how much he would love
to introduce you.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.870
Well, I'm not really working
in traditional media anymore.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.959
Oh. That's amazing,
that's awesome.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.439
It's new, we'll see.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.832
Yeah. Uh...

04:27.876 --> 04:29.356
Well, cheers.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.879
Cheers.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.794
Good to see you.You too.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.993
Okay, so,
for my birthday...Yes.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.952
No. No, no.
Your 30th.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.911
We were
thinking the three
of us could go

05:02.954 --> 05:04.216
to my parents' house
up north.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.394
Don't worry,
Don and Sylvie
are in Florida,

05:07.437 --> 05:09.570
so they will not be
gate-crashing the party.

05:09.613 --> 05:11.659
Okay.You're gonna come, right?

05:11.702 --> 05:14.226
You gotta come,
it's gonna be fun.
And I demand it.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.619
I will
definitely see.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.535
Oh.I should just go soon.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.508
Hello?

06:26.647 --> 06:28.257
Oh, my God!

06:28.300 --> 06:29.345
Oh, my God!

06:29.389 --> 06:30.520
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.479
I didn't think
you'd be
so jumpy.

06:35.786 --> 06:36.918
How was
your night?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.139
I liked your picture.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.579
Just one, huh?We were at dinner!

06:53.151 --> 06:54.457
Well, we're home now.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.290
Oh, you must be
feeling bad this morning.

07:49.425 --> 07:50.992
Feeling bad?

07:51.035 --> 07:52.994
I'm
feeling good,
but I didn't

07:53.037 --> 07:54.125
go hard
on the cocktails
last night.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.736
I did not go...

07:55.779 --> 07:57.955
Never just a quiet
night with them two,
is it?

07:57.999 --> 07:59.479
No.

07:59.522 --> 08:01.655
Do you want
a cardamom bun

08:01.698 --> 08:03.700
or a Danish?

08:03.744 --> 08:05.963
I thought
we were cutting
back on sugar.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.312
Well, we are,
but, you know,

08:07.356 --> 08:08.618
we're good
all through
the week,

08:08.662 --> 08:09.706
we can treat
ourselves every
once in a while,

08:09.750 --> 08:10.838
can't we?

08:10.881 --> 08:12.230
Okay, whatever
looks good.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.067
Excuse me,
can I just get
two coffees...

08:28.464 --> 08:29.770
Yeah, it just came up.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.076
Just came up.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.208
Just came up.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.646
Do you remember
that sales thing?

08:36.690 --> 08:38.343
Well, I think
it'd be bad
if I missed it.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.042
Oh, so Colleen texted me.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.785
Okay. Good to see you,
take care, bye!

08:44.828 --> 08:46.047
Yeah, it just
came up.

08:47.265 --> 08:48.397
They never
remember me
in there.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.616
Like, I come
in here
every week,

08:49.659 --> 08:51.139
it wouldn't
kill them
to say hello.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.532
They're so
weird in there.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.404
Okay, what do
you want?

08:55.447 --> 08:57.275
Danish looks
all right.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.581
It looks like
fresh out
of the oven.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.629
Oh, so Colleen
texted me

09:02.672 --> 09:04.065
this morning
about that
sales thing,

09:04.108 --> 09:06.328
Do you remember
this thing I told
you about?

09:06.371 --> 09:08.809
Well, anyway, it turns out
now they do need me to go.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.375
Why?

09:10.419 --> 09:12.203
Just, I came up,
I guess.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.206
I mean, it's
gonna be boring,
you know?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.425
A trip to Minneapolis,

09:16.468 --> 09:18.079
but I think it'd be bad
if I missed it.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.908
I guess you just
give me the impression

09:20.951 --> 09:22.518
that you didn't
really care
about that job.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.390
I think you can do
better than that.

09:36.401 --> 09:38.316
A blank canvas
can be intimidating.

09:38.360 --> 09:39.491
How do you
get started?

09:39.535 --> 09:41.624
Uh,
experimentation,
you know.

09:41.668 --> 09:42.886
Well, you know,
I try to be free
with it.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.932
I just... I'm
boring myself.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.369
I show everything
to Alice at a very
early stage.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.198
Oh, I'll be
right back.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.116
Hi!Oh, my God.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.033
Oh, God,
I feel like
a potato.

09:59.076 --> 10:00.121
You couldn't
be a potato.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.252
You look nice,
though.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.950
Oh, yeah.
Simon got
it for me.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.125
It's expensive.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.258
Uh, where's Tess,
I thought you were
gonna come together?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.565
Um, so, she's...

10:09.609 --> 10:10.958
Okay, she's
not coming.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.700
It's just... yeah,
she said she would,

10:13.743 --> 10:14.918
so I put her
on the list, and I...I know.

10:14.962 --> 10:16.267
Please don't
be mad at her.No, I'm...

10:16.311 --> 10:17.834
It's fine, it's fine.You know what she's like

10:17.878 --> 10:19.357
when it comes
to work stuff.I know.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.272
She gets all in
her head and...

10:21.316 --> 10:22.534
you know. I'm sorry.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.014
It's fine.Hey!

10:24.058 --> 10:25.755
Hi, Sophie.Hi!

10:25.799 --> 10:27.670
Thank you!
Oh, my God,
I need this.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.280
You learn
pretty quick

10:29.324 --> 10:30.804
that the
non-profit world,

10:30.847 --> 10:33.545
it attracts nearly as many
narcissists and sociopaths

10:33.589 --> 10:36.287
as, like, the corporate
sector does, so...

10:36.331 --> 10:38.594
Well, I think
that what you do
is amazing.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.856
I do, I do.
I think it's
incredible.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.597
It's like
a million times
more important

10:41.641 --> 10:42.946
than any
of this, but...Oh, my God.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.034
Thanks for
coming anyway.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.993
Stop it,
this is
amazing.

10:46.036 --> 10:47.777
Congratulations.Thank you.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.127
Thank you for
inviting me.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.607
I hope it's a
huge success.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.739
I'm so glad you
could make it,

10:52.782 --> 10:53.957
it's great
to see you.

11:00.834 --> 11:01.791
Thank you.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.464
Hey!

11:22.507 --> 11:23.595
Mmm.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.425
Mini pork bun?Oh, I'm fine.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.818
You sure?I'm fine.

11:28.862 --> 11:29.906
Alice, Uber's here.I'm sorry we didn't

11:29.950 --> 11:31.255
get to hang out
all night.It's okay.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.300
It's a big night
for him.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.694
So,

11:34.737 --> 11:36.043
you are gonna come
to the cottage, right?I promise, I promise.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.740
Alice!I'll see you tomorrow,

11:37.784 --> 11:38.915
good night.
I love you.Come on.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.700
Let's go!Goodnight. Love you, too.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.143
It was a complete
fucking train wreck.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.405
No one even showed up.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.019
There were, like,
a hundred people there.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.760
I'm talking about
important people.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.286
You still
don't understand
this business.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.635
it's cutthroat.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.636
If people
aren't coming
to your shows,

12:04.680 --> 12:05.899
it's because
you're washed up.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.424
You have
to be the best

12:10.599 --> 12:11.600
or you're nothing.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.863
You are the best.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.650
You are to me.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.092
Oh, my love.
I wish you could
see what I see.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.445
My perfectionist.

12:32.142 --> 12:33.491
You're so
brilliant.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.146
You're amazing.

12:38.627 --> 12:39.759
Hey.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.378
SIMON:
Hmm.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.848
Hey! Thank you.

13:56.357 --> 13:59.490
♪ You're like a bomb

13:59.534 --> 14:03.364

Sophie, um,
can you pull over?

14:49.105 --> 14:50.150
You okay?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.287
Fuck. Sorry, guys.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.593
SOPHIE:
You okay?Yeah.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.075
SOPHIE:
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.207
I shouldn't
have looked at
my phone, it's my bad.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.905
You're
all right.

15:11.649 --> 15:12.694
All right.TESS: I want birthday pancakes

15:12.737 --> 15:13.782
with real syrup.SOPHIE: Okay.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.523
Then leave the fake stuff.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.307
We got maple syrup right here.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.569
All right.SOPHIE: Okay.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.093
You want
chocolate chip
pancakes?

15:20.136 --> 15:21.921
Of course
you do. Okay.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.185
Two. And s'mores.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.491
Ooh,
S'mores!
Good idea.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.797
Okay.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.760
I think
it's just crazy.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.632
You can't let
a girl like that
wander around

15:37.675 --> 15:39.199
doing whatever
she wants.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.853
I mean,
of course, she's
gone missing.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.855
Parents have
no rules
anymore.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.857
My kids know exactly

15:45.901 --> 15:47.207
what kind of hell
there'd be to pay

15:47.250 --> 15:49.383
if I caught them
sneaking around
like that.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.081
I mean, why
would she put herself
in that situation?

16:06.269 --> 16:07.401
Shotgun.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.956
What's a yoga bro?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.307
You know, it's those
super muscular guys

16:44.351 --> 16:46.396
that have to grunt
their way into every pose.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.833
It's totally performative.SOPHIE: Right.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.009
And they have
to fight their way

16:50.052 --> 16:51.184
to the front
of the class

16:51.227 --> 16:53.447
so everybody can see
their balls hanging.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.368
SOPHIE:
All right.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.025
Thank you.

17:07.983 --> 17:10.290
Oh, your dad finally
fixed the screen door.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.727
Yeah,
he did it when
he opened up.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.555
Got it.SOPHIE: Thank you.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.426
Okay.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.341
All right.
You can put
that there.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.605
And then
through here.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.131
Okay, Tess,
you're in my
brother's room.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.220
Alice, you're
in my room
at the end.

17:27.263 --> 17:28.569
Great.SOPHIE: Yeah.

17:31.485 --> 17:34.009
Hmm.SOPHIE: Remember these?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.663
I love how
your mom never changes

17:35.706 --> 17:38.448
anything about
this place.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.968
All right.

18:20.490 --> 18:21.622
Thank you.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.390
You're right.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.348
Why... Why...
Why have
I stopped

18:52.392 --> 18:53.915
having sleep orgasms?

18:53.958 --> 18:55.090
That's
normal for you?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.352
In your sleep to...

18:56.396 --> 18:58.485
I like a free orgasm.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.097
Me, too. Oh, my God.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.533
Wouldn't have to
put in any work.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.190
I had a sex dream
the other night.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.322
Oh?

19:09.365 --> 19:11.280
No. I mean,
it was bad.

19:11.324 --> 19:12.586
Oh.It was...

19:12.629 --> 19:14.892
It was with the, um...

19:14.936 --> 19:16.981
the waiter from
the wine bar.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.766
He's hot.Ugh.

19:18.809 --> 19:20.507
Like, I shouldn't
be having

19:20.550 --> 19:23.074
sex dreams about
someone else
when I'm with Simon.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.034
Oof. Who
told you that?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.820
No one,
that's just
how I feel.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.831
Um, I'll clear...

19:52.016 --> 19:53.322
Alice.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.370
Alice.

19:59.937 --> 20:00.938
Alice!

20:02.810 --> 20:03.854
Look at me.

20:05.726 --> 20:06.814
You don't want me?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.557
I'm just tired.
Listen.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.472
If you don't want
to fuck me, you don't
want to fuck me.

20:12.515 --> 20:13.908
Alice.

20:13.951 --> 20:14.952
SOPHIE:
Alice?

20:16.650 --> 20:17.607
Will you come
join us?

20:19.566 --> 20:20.654
Sure.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.753
I don't know, I mean... I don't...

22:19.076 --> 22:21.905
Hey, everyone,
you are listening toHurdle.

22:21.949 --> 22:25.256
I am so, so excited
to bring you today's episode

22:25.300 --> 22:28.825
because I am chatting
with my dear friend...

22:28.869 --> 22:30.610
...core values,
and we're living

22:30.653 --> 22:32.829
and breathing them
every day in our lives.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.397
That's what makes us
feel most fulfilled.
Right.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.964
So if you can
begin your day like that,

22:37.007 --> 22:38.444
so it's not own your morning,

22:38.487 --> 22:41.011
a.k.a., like, do as much
as possible within,

22:41.055 --> 22:42.578
like, a three-hour time span

22:42.622 --> 22:44.580
starting at 4:00 a.m.
Correct.

22:44.624 --> 22:45.929
But they're
owning your morning

22:45.973 --> 22:47.583
by giving you and yourself,

22:47.627 --> 22:49.455
and your mental health,
and your soul what it needs.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.617
Hi there.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.232
Have you seen
this girl?
Andrea Evans.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.452
No, uh,
we just got here
yesterday.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.411
I'm sorry
I can't be
more helpful.

23:32.454 --> 23:33.977
You keep that,

23:34.021 --> 23:35.892
there's a hotline
you can call if
you've seen anything.

23:35.936 --> 23:38.199
Search parties leave
at 8:00 every morning
from the church,

23:38.242 --> 23:39.679
if you could
spare the time.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.159
Yeah, okay.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.684
Uh, thank you.
Or, good luck.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.555
Take care.

23:53.127 --> 23:54.824
Double
word score.

23:54.868 --> 23:58.349
Wow. "Door."
Wow, well done.

24:00.351 --> 24:02.571
You are making this
too easy.

24:02.615 --> 24:04.355
My turn. All right.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.400
All right.
That was rude.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.490
You really did it.

24:09.535 --> 24:10.971
SOPHIE:
Don't be mad.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.191
What? No.SOPHIE: Yes!

24:14.235 --> 24:16.019
Hey, Gossip Girl,
we need
a second opinion.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.153
Uh, what is it?

24:19.196 --> 24:20.459
"Quakey."

24:22.069 --> 24:24.637
Uh, maybe.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.291
We'll take that
as a yes,
so that is

24:27.335 --> 24:28.989
twenty-one,
double word score.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.730
Wait, why Gossip Girl?

24:30.773 --> 24:32.949
I don't know,
the phone, the hair.

24:36.997 --> 24:40.261
You are aware
that popular culture
has evolved

24:40.304 --> 24:42.437
over the
last decade.TESS: And?

24:42.481 --> 24:45.832
Maybe your
references are getting
a little bit stale.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.616
Yeah?TESS: Mm-hmm.

24:47.660 --> 24:48.922
A reboot?
With who?

25:42.453 --> 25:43.846
Hey.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.508
Um...

25:53.552 --> 25:55.728
so I think I'm gonna
have to leave early.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.078
I know,
it's just,
work is

25:58.121 --> 25:59.470
really intense
right now.

25:59.514 --> 26:02.343
Seriously?
We're here
for my birthday.

26:02.386 --> 26:05.041
I... Yeah,
I... Sorry, I...

26:06.477 --> 26:08.044
I don't really
expect you
to understand.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.611
You're right,
I don't understand.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.004
I was under
the impressionthat
we took the week off

26:11.047 --> 26:12.353
so that we could
spend it together.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.659
What are you taking
the week off from?

26:17.445 --> 26:19.012
I'm sorry,
does my work
not count

26:19.055 --> 26:20.361
because I don't
get paid for it?

26:20.404 --> 26:22.406
SOPHIE:
Of course, your
work counts, Tess.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.060
Your work is
amazing.

26:24.104 --> 26:26.846
Sophie, that's not

26:26.889 --> 26:28.238
what we're talking
about right now.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.047
Hey.Hello.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.006
Guess what
I brought?

26:57.616 --> 26:58.660
What?

26:58.704 --> 27:00.531
Fireworks for
Tess' birthday.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.621
It's a surprise
so don't say anything.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.318
Why are you doing
all this for her?

27:05.754 --> 27:07.974
I think you should
cut her some slack.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.803
This is a...

27:10.846 --> 27:13.327
It's a milestone
of a birthday,

27:13.370 --> 27:15.808
and I think that
she is a little nervous

27:15.851 --> 27:19.420
'cause... she thinks
that she should
be further along.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.685
I think
she would expect

27:23.729 --> 27:25.295
to be at Simon's
level right now,

27:25.339 --> 27:26.601
not that
she would admit that.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.649
Anyway,

27:31.693 --> 27:33.303
I thought we could
have a picnic

27:33.347 --> 27:35.262
at that little island
across the lake.

27:36.698 --> 27:38.657
Yeah, I don't want to be
in a boat with her right now.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.136
Stop it,
it'll be fun.

27:40.180 --> 27:41.921
Sophie, I'm serious.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.575
Maybe this is

27:44.619 --> 27:45.838
just about
our friendship
not being

27:45.881 --> 27:47.709
what it
used to be.Whose friendship?

27:48.797 --> 27:50.103
Mine and Tess'.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.326
I don't think
you're being fair.

27:59.112 --> 28:01.418
Anyway,

28:01.462 --> 28:04.683
we all think
our worst thoughts
at night.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.642
You will not
think this way
in the morning.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.701
Andrea!

28:25.312 --> 28:26.835
Andrea!

28:30.621 --> 28:32.362
Andrea!

28:32.406 --> 28:35.322
I haven't
let the girls leave
the house in days.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.889
They're on
the verge
of mutiny.

28:38.934 --> 28:42.068
If she's hurt,
it's probably someone
she knows.

28:49.423 --> 28:50.729
Andrea!

28:52.861 --> 28:55.168
Andrea!

28:55.211 --> 28:57.910
Listen,
forget about the history.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.607
We talked about this
over and over.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.262
You've told me you can't be
your real self around them.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.307
When you've seen them,
do you have a good time
or not?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.093
Why do you
put yourself through this?

29:07.136 --> 29:08.747
Do you feel better or worse?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.792
And I think you already know
what you have to do.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.576
And there is
a really easy solution,

29:12.620 --> 29:15.666
you don't need them
in your life anymore.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.320
It's tough, I know it's tough.

29:17.364 --> 29:20.106
Part of growing up is
knowing when to let go.

29:25.285 --> 29:28.375
Hey, you missed
a really fun day.

29:28.418 --> 29:29.985
Hey, where were you?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.595
I went out with
one of the search parties.

29:31.639 --> 29:33.510
Hmm. Did
you find her?

29:35.034 --> 29:36.775
No.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.865
So, definitely worth
missing spending
the day with us, then.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.214
All right, I need
some help
at the wood shed,

29:41.257 --> 29:42.563
can you help me out?Mm-hmm.

29:42.606 --> 29:43.782
SOPHIE:
Thank you.

29:48.308 --> 29:49.788
Fuck me!

29:52.181 --> 29:54.357
Okay, lesson
number one.

29:54.401 --> 29:55.837
This is
a maul.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.883
I never want
to hear you call it
an ax, okay?

29:59.232 --> 30:01.582
So look for the
natural splits
in the wood,

30:01.625 --> 30:03.236
get your distance.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.195
Feet like so.Okay.

30:07.283 --> 30:08.371
And when
you swing,

30:08.415 --> 30:09.677
you want this hand
to fall in line

30:09.720 --> 30:11.461
with this hand.
So, like...

30:13.115 --> 30:14.334
Okay.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.683
Got it?Yeah.

30:18.425 --> 30:19.730
Wow. You're good.Well,

30:19.774 --> 30:21.341
that was
hardly anything.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.429
Okay.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.520
Nice.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.401
Shit.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.491
Alice? I think
we have enough.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.797
No, it's fine.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.851
Yeah.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.026
Thanks.

31:08.823 --> 31:11.521
You just pretend to be
this meek little victim.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.349
You sit there with this
placid look on your face.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.003
I'm here
trying to get through to you,

31:15.047 --> 31:18.441
I'm actually asking you
to do something.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.443
This is exactly what you do.
This is exactly what you do.

31:21.096 --> 31:22.402
I'm tired...

31:23.011 --> 31:24.099
of carrying you.

32:03.791 --> 32:05.532
♪ You say

32:08.578 --> 32:11.451

Come on.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.332
Come on.No, I don't want to.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.206
All right.

33:15.906 --> 33:16.995
Okay.

33:20.563 --> 33:21.825
Hey.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.741
I want you.

33:33.576 --> 33:37.624
Whoo!
All right!
Come on, Sophie!

33:37.667 --> 33:39.278
Tess!TESS:

33:39.321 --> 33:41.802
Good morning!SOPHIE: Tess.

33:41.845 --> 33:43.412
And then what
happens to your body,

33:43.456 --> 33:44.761
it goes into starvation mode

33:44.805 --> 33:47.112
and you feel
compelled to eat...

33:47.155 --> 33:49.114
But, like...
like, a super a lot.

33:49.157 --> 33:50.245
Super a lot, got it.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.923
You're gonna
give us diabetes.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.099
I'm making
cinnamon rolls,

34:18.143 --> 34:19.883
I can't do it
without sugar.

34:19.927 --> 34:21.624
You know it's
more addictive
than cocaine, right?

34:21.668 --> 34:23.496
Yeah, obviously.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.280
Cocaine isn't
even that good.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.416
You know,
I remember a time

34:30.459 --> 34:32.809
when you used
to like sugar.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.115
Yeah.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.638
There's just
all this research now

34:35.682 --> 34:37.814
on how it, like, corrodes
your organs and stuff, so.

34:38.815 --> 34:39.816
Hmm.

34:41.296 --> 34:42.254
What?

34:44.778 --> 34:47.172
I...

34:47.215 --> 34:49.870
I just know what
disordered eating
looks like.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.666
Is this better?Alice, what are you doing?

35:03.710 --> 35:06.234
I mean, if you think
I should have more,
I can just keep going.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.975
Stop! Alice, stop!Is something wrong?

35:08.018 --> 35:09.846
I'm fine!
I'm fine!Stop, Alice!

35:21.641 --> 35:22.729
Hey, baby.

35:24.861 --> 35:26.559
Yeah, no, I can hear you.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.126
What's going on?

35:28.169 --> 35:30.563
I have no idea.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.522
...your friends,

35:33.566 --> 35:36.090
and that you're actually
at a cottage.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.136
So you... you lied to me.

35:38.832 --> 35:39.920
Yeah.

35:42.662 --> 35:43.750
No, I know.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.144
This is just classic bullshit.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.189
Like, why would you tell me

35:48.233 --> 35:49.582
that you're going on
a road trip when you...

35:49.625 --> 35:51.932
I don't know why. I know.

35:59.069 --> 36:00.070
Yeah.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.769
Yeah, okay.

36:03.683 --> 36:05.337
Yeah,
I love you.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.254
Who was that?

36:09.297 --> 36:12.474
Uh, just Simon.
He needs me.

36:12.518 --> 36:14.128
What? Why?You're kidding.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.956
No.What, he can't figure out

36:15.999 --> 36:17.566
how to turn the dishwasher on?

36:17.610 --> 36:19.742
When did he become
more important
to you than us?

36:19.786 --> 36:21.091
Jesus Christ, Tess!

36:21.135 --> 36:22.745
Not everything's
about you.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.443
Me? Are you serious?

36:30.710 --> 36:32.668
I can't believe
she's talking
about leaving.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.017
Yeah.

36:34.061 --> 36:35.715
She could
have stayed
for my birthday.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.760
It's...
frustrating.

36:37.804 --> 36:39.371
We're having
a good time, right?

36:41.373 --> 36:42.983
When did she
become such a flake.

36:45.681 --> 36:46.856
I love you, Alice.

37:37.777 --> 37:39.082
Did you take my stuff?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.782
Cinnamon bun?Tess.

37:43.304 --> 37:44.740
What stuff?

37:44.784 --> 37:46.089
My phone and my wallet.
I know you have them, come on.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.874
Why would I take
your phone and your wallet?

37:47.917 --> 37:50.093
You know why.I want to hear you say it.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.836
Sophie went
to the store
and...

37:53.880 --> 37:55.882
hm, you and I need
some alone time.

37:55.925 --> 37:58.145
That's the last thing
that we need, man.

38:04.151 --> 38:05.370
Okay, come on.
You know me
better than that.

38:10.679 --> 38:11.985
I'll never
forgive you, just
so you know.

38:13.465 --> 38:14.596
I'll tell you
where they are

38:14.640 --> 38:17.207
if you come out
on the paddle board.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.948
Oh, my God.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.489
Should we
play a game?ALICE: Like what?

38:37.532 --> 38:39.447
Stand up.Why?

38:39.491 --> 38:40.840
Come on, it'll be fun.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.895
Come on,
fight back.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.246
Come on!

38:57.465 --> 38:58.727
Christ, Tess.

39:09.390 --> 39:10.913
Ugh!

39:10.957 --> 39:12.219
What is wrong with you?

39:12.262 --> 39:13.481
I didn't think
you were gonna fall in.

39:13.525 --> 39:14.917
You were sitting down.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.356
Can you help?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.013
Yeah, it's freezing!

39:36.678 --> 39:37.853
What?

39:40.247 --> 39:41.727
What?My earring!

39:42.554 --> 39:44.294
Fuck!Well, it's gone now.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.948
Simon gave me
those earrings.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.226
What are
you doing?

40:03.270 --> 40:05.359
It's like
30 feet deep here.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.752
You can't
see shit
down there.

40:09.537 --> 40:10.495
Alice!

40:11.060 --> 40:12.061
Stop it.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.543
Alice!

40:17.806 --> 40:19.025
Alice!

40:21.070 --> 40:23.072
What are
you doing?

40:24.552 --> 40:27.120
I can't... I can't...

40:27.163 --> 40:28.251
I can't...Can't what?

40:28.295 --> 40:29.818
I can't do
another thing wrong.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.690
Fuck.Alice.

40:31.733 --> 40:33.169
I can't do
another thing wrong.

40:33.213 --> 40:35.737
Alice, what does
that even mean?

40:35.781 --> 40:38.392
No, I lied to him.
He doesn't even know
that I'm here.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.742
What?I mean, he does now.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.744
He called.

40:42.788 --> 40:44.442
Well, why did
you lie to him?

40:46.226 --> 40:48.446
Because I'm
bad.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.664
What?

40:55.627 --> 40:57.759
He wouldn't love
me if he knew
how bad I am.

41:01.807 --> 41:03.765
Jesus, is that something
that he tells you?

41:10.380 --> 41:12.295
You're such
a fucking cunt
sometimes.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.473
TESS:
Alice?

41:16.474 --> 41:17.649
Alice?

41:20.739 --> 41:22.915
Alice, is it?No! Just... no.

41:35.405 --> 41:36.537
Hey.

41:38.713 --> 41:40.759
Why do
you let him pull
this shit with you?

41:40.802 --> 41:43.849
He's not...
He's not
pulling anything.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.720
I lied to him, he has
every right to be angry.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.287
You lied?
About what?

41:47.330 --> 41:50.203
Just... about being here.

41:50.246 --> 41:51.900
Alice,
you can't tell

41:51.944 --> 41:53.598
your supposed life partner

41:53.641 --> 41:55.164
that you're going
to go on a trip with
your best friends

41:55.208 --> 41:57.297
and somehow
that's your fault.

41:57.340 --> 41:59.821
I can't think of a bigger
red flag than that.ALICE: It's not...

41:59.865 --> 42:01.431
Hey, can we
just approach this

42:01.475 --> 42:02.824
without
judgment?

42:02.868 --> 42:04.304
Are you seriously
telling me
that you have

42:04.347 --> 42:05.697
no opinions about this?

42:05.740 --> 42:07.873
Of course I do,
but Alice is
a grown woman.

42:07.916 --> 42:09.439
Yes! And I don't know
how any of this is

42:09.483 --> 42:10.876
your business.When you're friends

42:10.919 --> 42:12.094
with somebody,
it means you care

42:12.138 --> 42:13.269
about the other person.

42:13.313 --> 42:15.054
But I guess
that's a concept

42:15.097 --> 42:16.708
Simon managed
to erase from
your brain

42:16.751 --> 42:18.623
along with the rest
of your personality.Tess, stop it.

42:18.666 --> 42:20.059
Maybe this
is my personality

42:20.102 --> 42:21.495
and I'm changing,

42:21.539 --> 42:23.192
and you're the
shitty friend
for not, like,

42:23.236 --> 42:25.238
letting me
change. We're
not all content

42:25.281 --> 42:27.675
to, like, flip
between projects.

42:27.719 --> 42:29.459
Some of us have
real adult lives.

42:29.503 --> 42:31.853
Fucking a 40-year-old
does not make you an adult.

42:31.897 --> 42:33.028
He's 37.

42:33.072 --> 42:34.813
Yeah, he's a fucking clown.

42:34.856 --> 42:37.032
And he's got this stupid,
smarmy accent

42:37.076 --> 42:38.468
and his art is...

42:39.600 --> 42:42.429
self-indulgent,
derivative garbage.

42:42.472 --> 42:45.171
You're just jealous
because he's
successful and you're...

42:51.307 --> 42:52.526
I'm what?

42:53.745 --> 42:56.095
Simon loves me.
I'm happy.

42:58.532 --> 42:59.838
Is this what
you think love is?

42:59.881 --> 43:01.448
What would you know?
You've never been

43:01.491 --> 43:03.319
in a serious
relationship.

43:03.363 --> 43:06.148
Romantic love isn't
the only kind of love.

43:06.192 --> 43:07.889
Only boring people
think that.

43:07.933 --> 43:10.457
Okay, cool.
I guess I'm boring then.

43:10.500 --> 43:11.850
Well, I mean,
if the shoe fits.
I didn't say it.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.155
God, I can't
stand you
right now!

43:13.199 --> 43:14.156
I can't stand
you right now!

43:46.275 --> 43:52.412
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

44:10.778 --> 44:12.345
Alice?

44:12.388 --> 44:14.216
Please, please go away.
Please go away.
Please go away.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.218
Please go.

44:17.698 --> 44:19.439
Please go.

44:19.482 --> 44:21.571
Alice?Please go away, please!

45:32.251 --> 45:33.731
Andrea!

45:36.734 --> 45:38.257
Andrea!

46:46.499 --> 46:47.805
Hello?

46:58.119 --> 46:59.338
Andrea?

49:22.176 --> 49:24.309
I'm assuming
you don't care
that I was worried.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.406
Can I come in?

49:36.147 --> 49:37.322
I guess.

49:53.816 --> 49:55.601
I made you a sandwich
in case you're hungry

49:55.644 --> 49:56.994
but don't want
to admit it.

50:01.650 --> 50:02.869
Thank you.

50:15.229 --> 50:17.014
Sophie's gone
looking for you.

50:17.057 --> 50:18.537
I think she's
pissed at us.

50:24.412 --> 50:25.892
I'm sorry
that I made you worry.

50:28.764 --> 50:29.896
You good?

50:35.336 --> 50:36.729
I don't want
to go home.

50:41.255 --> 50:42.387
Then we'll stay.

51:21.861 --> 51:23.123
Sophie back yet?

51:24.168 --> 51:25.125
No.

51:27.519 --> 51:29.086
This ax is a
piece of shit.

51:30.130 --> 51:31.523
That's
actually
a maul.

51:31.566 --> 51:32.654
Ugh, great.

51:34.352 --> 51:35.440
Thank you for that.

51:38.312 --> 51:39.618
"She felt very young,

51:39.661 --> 51:42.229
"and at the same time
unspeakably aged.

51:42.273 --> 51:44.971
"She sliced like a knife
through everything.

51:45.014 --> 51:48.453
"She had a perpetual sense
of being out, out,

51:48.496 --> 51:50.368
"far out to sea and alone.

51:51.630 --> 51:53.153
"She always had
the feeling that it was

51:53.197 --> 51:56.330
"very, very dangerous
to live even one day."

51:58.245 --> 52:00.465
I like you
reading me to sleep.

52:20.789 --> 52:22.487
You were gone a while.

52:22.530 --> 52:23.966
I needed some space.

52:24.489 --> 52:25.707
You know,

52:25.751 --> 52:28.188
this trip isn't
just about you,
Tess.

52:28.232 --> 52:29.711
You make me sound
like a bully.

52:30.103 --> 52:31.191
Well...

52:36.631 --> 52:37.632
I'm not a bully!

52:39.765 --> 52:41.636
Oh, my God, stop!

52:42.855 --> 52:44.422
Wow. Now that
is cleared up,

52:44.465 --> 52:45.901
who would
like a donut?

52:49.340 --> 52:50.384
Hot Chocolate?

52:50.428 --> 52:51.603
Yes, please.Yeah.

52:58.218 --> 53:00.655
How did Simon
know you were here?

53:00.699 --> 53:02.614
He looked at my email.

53:02.657 --> 53:04.181
He never would have
let me come.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.139
What?

53:06.183 --> 53:08.359
Yeah, he checks
things sometimes.

53:08.402 --> 53:09.925
Alice.

53:09.969 --> 53:12.101
I know.

53:12.145 --> 53:14.800
He always has a reason.

53:14.843 --> 53:16.715
I take my phone
into the bathroom
with me

53:16.758 --> 53:17.846
now when I shower.

53:17.890 --> 53:19.152
Andrea!

53:22.329 --> 53:24.113
Andrea!

53:31.730 --> 53:32.861
Andrea!

54:12.814 --> 54:14.903
I know
this sounds crazy,
but sometimes it feels like...

54:16.557 --> 54:18.255
like he can read my mind,

54:18.864 --> 54:20.648
and, like...

54:20.692 --> 54:22.128
if he can do that, then...

54:24.304 --> 54:26.915
there's nowhere left
that I can actually be alone.

54:29.875 --> 54:31.920
I never know what's
going to make him angry,

54:31.964 --> 54:34.575
so I spend all this time

54:34.619 --> 54:37.056
trying to be good,
trying to think of ways
to be better.

54:37.099 --> 54:39.754
Like if I could just
purify my thoughts.

54:44.672 --> 54:45.934
But you can't.
I mean...

54:48.546 --> 54:49.721
it's never good enough.

54:51.288 --> 54:52.941
I... I don't
know.

54:55.640 --> 54:57.859
But he doesn't hurt me
or anything, you know?

54:57.903 --> 54:59.731
He doesn't hurt you?

55:03.735 --> 55:05.911
I really wish
you would have
told us this sooner.

55:07.956 --> 55:09.218
I didn't know
what to say.

55:23.842 --> 55:26.932
♪ Happy birthday to you

55:29.064 --> 55:30.631
Happy birthday!

55:30.675 --> 55:31.850
Wow!

55:31.893 --> 55:33.852
Oh, you're
a wise old lady now.

55:33.895 --> 55:35.984
Uh, I have
always been
a wise old lady.

55:36.594 --> 55:37.769
In spirit, at least.

55:37.812 --> 55:40.554
Now you are
in body, too.Mm-hmm.

55:40.598 --> 55:42.687
I'm just gonna
go for it.

55:42.730 --> 55:44.819
Uh, I'm sorry,
but I don't think

55:44.863 --> 55:46.691
this is enough
chocolate chips.

55:46.734 --> 55:49.171
Whoa.Excuse me?

55:49.215 --> 55:50.825
Is this how you
treat people
on their birthday?

55:50.869 --> 55:53.654
That's a good
chip-to-pancake ratio.

55:53.698 --> 55:55.264
Oh, my God.

55:58.311 --> 55:59.573
We should go out tonight.

55:59.617 --> 56:01.445
Is there even
anything around here?

56:01.488 --> 56:03.403
Maybe the place
near the food mart.

56:03.447 --> 56:06.145
I just don't know if it's open
this early in the season.

56:07.233 --> 56:08.626
I could check
if I had my phone.

56:14.849 --> 56:15.981
Do you want it back?

56:18.200 --> 56:19.506
No.

56:19.550 --> 56:20.768
Not yet.

56:25.556 --> 56:27.253
What will he do
if he doesn't
hear from you?

56:30.517 --> 56:31.605
I'm not sure.

56:38.264 --> 56:39.613
I could text him

56:39.657 --> 56:41.528
and tell him
that you got
hit by a bus.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.663
Oh, my God, Tess.

57:18.130 --> 57:19.827
Oh, happy birthday!Happy birthday!

57:19.871 --> 57:21.046
Happy
Birthday!To me.

57:21.089 --> 57:22.221
To you!

57:27.444 --> 57:28.488
Oh, Jesus.

57:31.273 --> 57:32.361
Ugh!

58:47.175 --> 58:50.004
No, I...
I feel like I got one.

58:50.048 --> 58:51.310
Don't say that!

58:51.353 --> 58:53.834
No, in sympathy.
In sympathy.

58:53.878 --> 58:55.227
I don't really have one,

58:55.270 --> 58:57.403
but I just need to pee
all the fucking time.

58:57.446 --> 58:59.884
Needing to pee
and having a UTI is not
the same thing.

58:59.927 --> 59:02.843
Yeah, it is!
It's like Cystitis and, like...

59:02.887 --> 59:05.106
Cystitis?ALICE: Oh, she's smart.

59:05.150 --> 59:06.455
I need to pee.

59:07.631 --> 59:08.893
So, you know.

59:10.111 --> 59:11.243
I...ALICE: Ugh.

59:12.940 --> 59:14.115
Do you guys know what?SOPHIE: What?

59:14.159 --> 59:15.769
Hey.SOPHIE: What?

59:15.813 --> 59:16.857
♪ You say

59:19.207 --> 59:21.601
♪ I only hear

Hmm. Simon thinks
chips are disgusting.

1:00:40.419 --> 1:00:42.551
Nobody actually
thinks that.ALICE: He does.

1:00:43.248 --> 1:00:44.641
"Alice, that's enough...

1:00:44.684 --> 1:00:47.339
"that's enough
saturated fats to...

1:00:47.382 --> 1:00:50.168
"Alice,
that's enough saturated fat
to kill a horse.

1:00:51.865 --> 1:00:55.477
"Alice.
Alice...

1:00:55.521 --> 1:00:59.090
"You'll regret that
when you get on
the scale in the morning.

1:00:59.133 --> 1:01:01.092
"You are going to get fat
if you keep eating like that."

1:01:25.725 --> 1:01:27.335
What, do I just
light it?

1:01:27.379 --> 1:01:28.510
This was your idea.

1:01:28.554 --> 1:01:29.947
That doesn't mean
I know how to do it.

1:01:29.990 --> 1:01:31.775
Just,
I don't know, light
the string thing.

1:01:31.818 --> 1:01:33.037
This thing?ALICE: Yeah.

1:01:34.386 --> 1:01:36.431
Gosh.

1:01:38.738 --> 1:01:40.174
Oh, my God.

1:02:34.925 --> 1:02:37.405
I feel like garbage.

1:02:37.449 --> 1:02:40.234
You asked
the waitress
for birthday shots.

1:02:40.278 --> 1:02:42.454
Remember that drink
you used to make us?

1:02:42.497 --> 1:02:45.718
Which one?Gin and Smirnoff Ice.

1:02:46.371 --> 1:02:48.199
Ugh.

1:02:52.899 --> 1:02:54.945
Oh, that must
be egg guy.

1:02:54.988 --> 1:02:56.207
Egg guy?

1:02:56.250 --> 1:02:58.165
Oh, you should come.
He's guaranteed to have,

1:02:58.209 --> 1:03:00.385
like, a duck
or a kitten with him.

1:03:01.081 --> 1:03:02.561
I like cats.

1:03:06.695 --> 1:03:08.654
Oh.

1:03:20.753 --> 1:03:21.972
There's my girl.

1:03:29.109 --> 1:03:30.284
Missed you.

1:03:32.243 --> 1:03:33.853
I didn't know
you were coming.

1:03:33.897 --> 1:03:35.724
I've been calling
and calling.

1:03:35.768 --> 1:03:38.205
Well, the service
is pretty bad up here.

1:03:38.249 --> 1:03:39.859
Your Instagram feed
says otherwise.

1:03:42.906 --> 1:03:45.038
Well, I'm sure
Alice will explain
it all to me later.

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:54.308
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:03:56.528 --> 1:03:58.269
Alice, will you
stop fussing?

1:03:58.312 --> 1:03:59.531
I can...

1:04:02.447 --> 1:04:03.752
It's...
It's fine.

1:04:07.234 --> 1:04:08.670
I guess I got too much, eh.

1:04:09.802 --> 1:04:11.586
I hope no one was
desperate for olives.

1:04:34.522 --> 1:04:37.351
This is kind
of a girls trip, Simon.

1:04:37.395 --> 1:04:39.832
We weren't
expecting you.

1:04:39.876 --> 1:04:43.749
What, are we telling
ghost stories?

1:04:43.792 --> 1:04:46.360
Alice was missing
me, so I thought
I'd swing by.

1:04:49.581 --> 1:04:50.582
Tess.

1:04:52.671 --> 1:04:54.281
And Sophie.Thanks.

1:04:58.807 --> 1:05:00.244
Your favorite,
my love.

1:05:00.287 --> 1:05:01.419
Thank you.

1:05:09.993 --> 1:05:11.168
Jeez, are you sure
you're not trying

1:05:11.211 --> 1:05:13.170
to give us
mad cow disease,
Simon?

1:05:15.389 --> 1:05:16.695
Would you like me
to put yours back on,

1:05:16.738 --> 1:05:18.001
Tess?It's fine.

1:05:18.044 --> 1:05:19.002
It's really
not a problem.It's fine.

1:05:25.312 --> 1:05:26.270
Sorry.

1:05:27.619 --> 1:05:28.968
Well, cheers.

1:05:34.713 --> 1:05:35.801
Cheers.

1:05:55.516 --> 1:05:57.127
I was pretty worried
about you

1:05:57.170 --> 1:05:58.563
when I didn't
hear back from you.

1:06:00.478 --> 1:06:02.393
You know, I heard about
the girl who went missing.

1:06:03.263 --> 1:06:04.656
Yeah.

1:06:04.699 --> 1:06:06.353
They didn't
find the guy
who killed her yet.

1:06:06.397 --> 1:06:08.355
Why would you
just assume
that she's dead?

1:06:09.400 --> 1:06:10.749
I'm not assuming.

1:06:19.714 --> 1:06:21.890
The checkout clerk
couldn't stop going
on about it.

1:06:47.438 --> 1:06:49.353
Um, I found...

1:06:49.396 --> 1:06:51.485
this thing
out of that cottage.

1:06:56.577 --> 1:06:57.752
It's just weird.

1:07:00.625 --> 1:07:02.888
It might be hers,
it might mean something.

1:07:02.931 --> 1:07:03.976
What, this?

1:07:05.804 --> 1:07:07.414
Alice, darling, I...

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:09.068
I really don't think
anyone's gonna
care about this.

1:07:14.813 --> 1:07:16.032
No, probably not.

1:07:20.732 --> 1:07:21.733
You look different.

1:07:26.912 --> 1:07:29.306
She looks like herself.Mm-hmm.

1:07:29.349 --> 1:07:30.307
No, it's
the hair, I think.

1:07:35.399 --> 1:07:36.661
Yeah, it's very...

1:07:38.010 --> 1:07:39.098
bohemian.

1:07:45.104 --> 1:07:46.366
My beautiful girl.

1:08:20.357 --> 1:08:21.401
Hmm.

1:08:23.142 --> 1:08:25.623
You didn't tell me
you were living
in the lap of luxury.

1:08:31.150 --> 1:08:32.891
But then there's lots
of things you didn't
tell me.

1:08:34.458 --> 1:08:37.939
I mean, how are
we supposed to be
happy together

1:08:37.983 --> 1:08:39.376
if we can't trust
each other?

1:08:42.814 --> 1:08:45.121
Are you sorry
for what you did?

1:08:47.949 --> 1:08:51.214
It's completely
destabilizing

1:08:51.257 --> 1:08:52.737
when you do
shit like this.

1:08:52.780 --> 1:08:54.304
It derails my work.

1:08:54.347 --> 1:08:55.870
I know, I'm sorry.

1:08:55.914 --> 1:08:57.481
I just...
I...

1:08:57.524 --> 1:08:58.699
I'm trying to work out

1:08:58.743 --> 1:09:00.701
why you would choose

1:09:00.745 --> 1:09:02.355
to hurt me
so deliberately.I just... No.

1:09:02.399 --> 1:09:03.835
I...

1:09:03.878 --> 1:09:05.010
I mean, I just wanted

1:09:05.053 --> 1:09:06.490
to hang out
with my friends.Right.

1:09:06.533 --> 1:09:07.578
I wasn't...So you wanted to be here

1:09:07.621 --> 1:09:09.057
with them at my expense.

1:09:10.755 --> 1:09:12.235
You're incredibly
selfish.

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:26.771
Come here.

1:09:31.515 --> 1:09:32.690
Come on.

1:09:42.961 --> 1:09:44.615
I haven't even
got to properly
kiss you yet.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:55.060
Just let me
brush my teeth.

1:11:41.732 --> 1:11:42.907
Should...

1:14:25.548 --> 1:14:26.810
Actually I need
to get up as soon

1:14:26.853 --> 1:14:27.941
as possible
in the morning

1:14:27.985 --> 1:14:29.160
so we can get
out of here.

1:14:31.510 --> 1:14:33.164
I can't wait
to get home.

1:15:07.764 --> 1:15:08.808
You're leaving?

1:15:08.852 --> 1:15:10.680
Uh, I have to. Yeah.

1:15:10.723 --> 1:15:11.811
You know that.

1:15:36.227 --> 1:15:37.533
Be home soon.

1:15:39.143 --> 1:15:40.231
Ah...

1:15:47.847 --> 1:15:49.588
God, they
take themselves so
fucking seriously,

1:15:49.632 --> 1:15:50.894
don't they?

1:15:50.937 --> 1:15:52.199
Look at this guy.

1:15:53.070 --> 1:15:55.289
Come on, man.

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:57.161
Maybe I should
get out and push.

1:16:02.427 --> 1:16:03.559
Sophie!

1:16:05.735 --> 1:16:06.779
SIMON:
What the fuck.

1:16:08.389 --> 1:16:09.434
What the fuck are you doing?

1:16:12.132 --> 1:16:13.873
Look what you've done
to my fucking car!

1:16:16.223 --> 1:16:18.312
What...

1:16:18.356 --> 1:16:19.705
What the...
What is wrong
with you?

1:16:24.841 --> 1:16:25.842
Alice.

1:16:27.234 --> 1:16:28.192
Alice, come on.
Get in the car.

1:16:31.369 --> 1:16:32.631
Alice.

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:34.981
Alice.

1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:36.592
No.

1:16:43.686 --> 1:16:44.904
SIMON:
Jesus Christ.

1:16:47.428 --> 1:16:48.647
Come on. Mm.

1:16:49.561 --> 1:16:50.649
We should
get going.

1:16:51.607 --> 1:16:52.825
Let's just...

1:16:52.869 --> 1:16:54.740
Come on, put
the fucking ax down.

1:16:54.784 --> 1:16:56.568
It's a fucking
maul, Simon.

1:16:58.091 --> 1:17:00.790
Can you put
the maul down?

1:17:02.879 --> 1:17:03.923
Alice?

1:17:05.316 --> 1:17:06.839
I know
you're very
emotional.

1:17:07.884 --> 1:17:09.929
In fact,
I came
out here

1:17:09.973 --> 1:17:11.104
because I
was worried.

1:17:11.583 --> 1:17:12.802
She said no.

1:17:20.026 --> 1:17:21.027
Alice?

1:17:22.638 --> 1:17:23.813
Just... Hey.

1:17:24.988 --> 1:17:25.989
Hey.

1:17:27.904 --> 1:17:30.602
Alice, let's
just, uh...

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:32.256
just take a breath.

1:17:32.299 --> 1:17:33.518
Just get in the car.

1:17:33.910 --> 1:17:35.041
Come home.

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:38.915
You've
always said

1:17:38.958 --> 1:17:40.351
they don't really know you.

1:17:40.394 --> 1:17:41.657
You're so full
of shit.

1:17:45.399 --> 1:17:46.400
Alice.

1:17:47.967 --> 1:17:49.229
It's just...

1:17:50.970 --> 1:17:52.929
It's you and me,
come on.
It's just us.

1:17:54.234 --> 1:17:55.671
Let's go home.

1:17:55.714 --> 1:17:57.585
We can work
through this.

1:17:57.629 --> 1:17:59.631
I'm trying
to prove
I'm someone

1:17:59.675 --> 1:18:00.763
who really loves you.

1:18:02.547 --> 1:18:04.549
Let's just forget
about all of this,
it doesn't matter.

1:18:04.592 --> 1:18:06.072
She said no.

1:18:06.116 --> 1:18:08.553
Why don't you shut
your fucking mouth?

1:18:08.596 --> 1:18:10.947
And stay the fuck
out of this!

1:18:12.078 --> 1:18:13.210
Back off!

1:18:33.926 --> 1:18:34.927
It's okay.

1:19:15.446 --> 1:19:16.752
Fuck this.

1:19:24.629 --> 1:19:25.891
I give it a week.

1:19:54.398 --> 1:19:57.096
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

1:20:27.387 --> 1:20:29.259
Sometimes I get a...

1:20:29.302 --> 1:20:31.565
a word or a saying
stuck in my head.

1:20:32.088 --> 1:20:33.263
Like a...

1:20:35.004 --> 1:20:37.093
phrase that keeps surfacing,

1:20:37.136 --> 1:20:39.225
and it will just repeat itself
again and again and again

1:20:39.269 --> 1:20:40.618
until it's all I can hear.

1:20:43.839 --> 1:20:46.842
And for a while,
it was this voice asking me...

1:20:49.018 --> 1:20:51.368
"What are the chances?

1:20:51.411 --> 1:20:53.239
"What are the chances?
What are the chances?"

1:20:54.762 --> 1:20:56.242
What are
the chances of what?

1:20:58.418 --> 1:21:00.116
Um, I don't
know. Maybe...

1:21:04.816 --> 1:21:07.210
what are the chances
I don't come out
on the other side?

1:21:08.951 --> 1:21:10.256
What are the chances
I don't want to?

1:21:17.785 --> 1:21:19.962
And lately,
it's, um...

1:21:23.269 --> 1:21:24.575
someone asking me,

1:21:24.618 --> 1:21:25.881
"Where will you
put your shame?

1:21:25.924 --> 1:21:27.186
"Where will you
put your shame?"

1:21:27.230 --> 1:21:28.753
And it's my voice,
but it isn't.

1:21:33.801 --> 1:21:35.194
You can
give it
to us.

1:21:37.022 --> 1:21:38.241
Here.

1:22:05.094 --> 1:22:06.356
Did it work?
