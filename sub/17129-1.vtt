10:46.980 --> 10:48.248
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.583
I AM DR. VIC PALMERO,
CARDIOLOGIST.

10:50.583 --> 10:51.819
THE HOTEL
SENT ME UP HERE.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.220
SOMEBODY'S HAVING
HEART PAINS.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.254
OKAY, SO WHO'S HE?

10:54.254 --> 10:57.057
THIS IS MY NURSE,
GEORGE.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.028
NURSE PRACTITIONER.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.329
LET ME CHECK.
HOLD ON.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.998
CARMEN!

11:04.998 --> 11:08.335
HEY, CHINGY, I'M SORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.471
RELAX, MAN,
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.741
THAT'S YOUR POPS?

11:13.741 --> 11:16.209
YEAH.

11:17.610 --> 11:18.946
YOU WANT HIM OUT OF HERE?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.347
GET YOUR STUFF.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.982
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.350
I'M STAYING WITH
MY FRIENDS.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.919
FRIENDS? HOW DO YOU EVEN
KNOW THESE PEOPLE?

11:25.919 --> 11:27.354
ZACK BROKE UP WITH ME
AT A CLUB,

11:27.354 --> 11:29.056
AND I WAS CRYING IN
THE BATHROOM.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.191
ONE OF CHINGY'S DANCERS
WAS THERE TO CHEER ME UP,

11:31.191 --> 11:33.794
SO WE JUST STARTED
HANGING.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.897
WHO'S CHINGY?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.966
WHO'S CHINGY?!
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!

11:38.966 --> 11:41.201
HIS VIDEOS ARE ON
ALL THE TIME!

11:41.201 --> 11:44.137
"BALLER BABY."

11:44.137 --> 11:46.840
"HOLIDAY INN."

11:46.840 --> 11:48.041
IS SHE OKAY, GEORGE?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.377
HEY, WHAT IS CHINGY
DOING HERE?

11:51.912 --> 11:53.981
GET YOUR STUFF.
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.849
NO! GOD, NO!
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

11:55.849 --> 11:58.786
THESE ARE MY NEW FAMILY.
THEY'RE GOING TO PROTECT ME.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.756
LADY DOESN'T WANT TO GO,
LADY DOESN'T GO.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.624
THE LADY'S 15.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.993
I'M OUT.

12:29.716 --> 12:34.121
HEY, THERE SHE IS!

12:34.121 --> 12:38.425
LOOK, LOOK, I MADE ALL
YOUR FAVORITES.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.860
YOU MUST BE HUNGRY.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.294
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.164
BEFORE WE GET TO
THE ANGEL FOOD CAKE...

12:45.565 --> 12:48.235
...I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I DIDN'T LOSE MY COOL

12:48.235 --> 12:51.905
OR CONFRONT CARMEN THE WHOLE
SIX-HOUR RIDE HOME.

12:53.673 --> 12:57.010
BUT CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED...

12:57.010 --> 12:59.712
I THINK WE GOT SOME THINGS
TO TALK ABOUT.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.449
YEAH, LIKE A PUNISHMENT.

13:02.449 --> 13:06.119
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TALK
ABOUT PUNISHMENT NOW.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.821
WE'RE JUST GLAD
SHE'S HOME.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.023
WHAT?!

13:10.023 --> 13:11.758
WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT PUNISHMENT.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.426
I THINK I SHOULD GET
HER CELLPHONE.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.362
MAX!

13:15.362 --> 13:16.396
HEY, I WAS HERE!

13:16.396 --> 13:17.865
I'M THE GOOD ONE!

13:17.865 --> 13:19.232
I DID ALL HER CHORES!

13:19.232 --> 13:21.568
I THINK I SHOULD AT LEAST
GET HER LAPTOP!

13:21.568 --> 13:23.436
MAX!

13:23.436 --> 13:26.306
GO TO BED NOW.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.241
YEAH, THIS IS A REAL GOOD
LESSON FOR ME.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.343
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
IN THE MORNING!

13:32.512 --> 13:34.948
MAYBE!

13:38.952 --> 13:41.421
ALL RIGHT, WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED UP THERE?

13:41.421 --> 13:43.924
NOW'S NOT THE TIME,
GEORGE.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.492
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
ANYWAY.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.427
EVERYTHING YOU DO
IS MY BUSINESS.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.963
YOU HAVE ISSUES.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.600
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I HAVE ISSUES.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.602
I TRY TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING
I NEVER HAD,

13:55.602 --> 13:56.736
AND YOU RUN AWAY FROM IT.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.738
OH, YEAH,
I HAVE EVERYTHING.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.274
I HAVE A FATHER AND A MOTHER
WHO TREAT ME LIKE A BABY

14:01.274 --> 14:02.976
AND CONTROL EVERYTHING I DO.

14:02.976 --> 14:06.346
CARMEN, YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU HAVE PARENTS WHO CARE.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.680
LOOK,
I DIDN'T HAVE A DAD.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.050
I WOULD PRAY THAT MY MOM
WOULD COME HOME AT 6:00

14:10.050 --> 14:11.718
SO I COULD SEE HER
BEFORE BEDTIME.

14:11.718 --> 14:14.187
IF I WAS LUCKY, SHE CAME HOME
DRUNK WITH THE SPINS

14:14.187 --> 14:17.057
SO SHE'D HAVE TO
HOLD ONTO ME.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.291
THAT WAS MY HUG!

14:18.291 --> 14:20.160
GEORGE!

14:20.160 --> 14:22.229
REMEMBER THE LITERATURE?

14:22.229 --> 14:24.197
SHE'S HOME SAFE
AND SOUND.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.765
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY NOW.

14:25.765 --> 14:28.335
ANGIE, DON'T TRY TO PRETEND
EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.904
IT WASN'T ALL RIGHT LAST NIGHT
WHEN YOU WERE CRYING.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.940
MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE
THOUGHT OF THAT

14:32.940 --> 14:34.041
WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO LEAVE.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.208
STOP IT!

14:36.409 --> 14:40.347
WE ALL NEED TO GIVE
EACH OTHER TIME TO ACCEPT...

14:43.416 --> 14:47.354
...TO ACCEPT
THE REUNIFICATION PROCESS.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.570
I'M SORRY, MOM.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.173
WELL, IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.608
YOU'RE HOME, HUH?

15:08.608 --> 15:12.645
I AM NOT GOING TO HAMMER YOU
WITH QUESTIONS.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.382
YOU WANT SOME TEA,
HONEY?

15:15.382 --> 15:16.316
SUGAR, CREAM?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.152
ARE YOU A WOMAN NOW?
COOKIE?

15:21.921 --> 15:24.057
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO DO THAT.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.028
I'M SORRY.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.563
SO WHAT GRADE IS CHINGY IN?

15:35.035 --> 15:38.605
Man: NEXT ON "INSIDE THE MUSIC,"
WE'LL LOOK AT RAP GROUPIES.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.807
IF YOU THINK IT'S WILD
BACKSTAGE AT THE SHOW,

15:40.807 --> 15:44.677
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS
AT THE HOTEL WITH THE HO'S!

15:46.779 --> 15:48.982
Man #2: UNFORTUNATELY,
THE WIDE-EYED FAWN

15:48.982 --> 15:51.418
HAS WANDERED TOO FAR
FROM THE HERD.

15:51.418 --> 15:56.689
NOTICE HOW SHE SEEMS UNPREPARED
WHEN THE LARGE STAG MOUNTS HER.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.894
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

16:01.894 --> 16:03.263
OUT.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.931
IT'S YOUR FIRST NIGHT HOME.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.099
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING OUT?

16:06.099 --> 16:07.367
WHY SHOULDN'T I?

16:07.367 --> 16:09.169
I'VE BEEN GOING OUT
EVERY NIGHT.

16:09.169 --> 16:12.639
SO YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH
IN SAN FRANCISCO?

16:15.608 --> 16:17.010
ENOUGH?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.245
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:18.245 --> 16:20.180
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
NO, I DON'T.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.415
YOU WERE IN A HOTEL ROOM
ALONE WITH ZACK.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.051
I THINK
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.120
YOU THINK I HAD SEX
WITH ZACK?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.522
WELL, I DIDN'T!

16:29.522 --> 16:31.758
HE TRIED TO GET ME TO,
BUT I WOULDN'T.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.892
YEAH, RIGHT.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.694
HOW STUPID
DO YOU THINK I AM?

16:34.694 --> 16:36.563
IT'S SAN FRANCISCO.

16:36.563 --> 16:37.464
YOU GOT MEN AND WOMEN,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.599
WOMEN AND WOMEN,
MEN AND MEN...

16:39.599 --> 16:40.900
FREE FOR ALL UP THERE!

16:40.900 --> 16:42.935
NOTHING HAPPENED!

16:42.935 --> 16:44.137
HE TRIED TO GET ME DRUNK.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.305
I WOULDN'T DO THAT,
EITHER.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.739
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

16:46.739 --> 16:48.908
YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
TO A DOCTOR AND TEST ME?

16:48.908 --> 16:49.976
I'M STILL A VIRGIN.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.311
THEY HAVE A TEST?

16:52.945 --> 16:54.314
WE'LL GO RIGHT NOW.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.515
WHAT TIME IS IT, 9:00?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.350
WE'LL GO TO
THE URGENT CARE.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.885
DAD!

16:58.885 --> 17:00.153
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.088
DON'T LIE TO ME!

17:01.088 --> 17:02.255
I DIDN'T!

17:02.255 --> 17:04.757
YOU RAISED ME BETTER
THAN THAT!

17:04.757 --> 17:07.760
NO, I DIDN'T.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.900
I WASN'T THERE ENOUGH...

17:13.900 --> 17:15.234
WORKED TOO HARD.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.770
I LOST MY TEMPER.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.406
I WAS WAY TOO TOUGH ON YOU.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.583
YEAH, YOU WERE.

17:30.583 --> 17:34.554
BUT WHENEVER ZACK
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING,

17:34.554 --> 17:36.756
I KEPT HEARING
YOUR VOICE.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.791
"DON'T DO ANYTHING
YOU'D BE ASHAMED

17:38.791 --> 17:41.128
TO TELL ME OR MOM ABOUT."

17:41.128 --> 17:43.196
IT WORKED, OKAY?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.675
I'M PRETTY SURE YOUR MOM
TOLD YOU THAT,

17:55.675 --> 17:57.577
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.858
WELL, SINCE WE'RE
ADMITTING STUFF...

18:11.858 --> 18:13.025
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT ZACK.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.927
HE WAS ONLY AFTER
ONE THING.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.364
I WISH I COULD SAY IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN,

18:17.364 --> 18:20.767
BUT...I'M ALWAYS
GOING TO BE RIGHT.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.805
SO...

18:25.805 --> 18:27.974
ARE WE OKAY HERE?

18:27.974 --> 18:29.842
YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.713
GET SOME SLEEP.
YOU'VE HAD A LONG DAY.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.514
I WILL.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.048
RIGHT AFTER I GO OUT.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.351
YOU'RE GOING OUT?

18:38.351 --> 18:40.220
BUT YOU JUST GOT BACK.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.758
YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.862
OKAY.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.799
I GET IT.
IT'S TOO SOON.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.334
I'LL JUST GO TO BED.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.802
THANK YOU.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.741
BUT THINGS
ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.176
I'M DIFFERENT.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.577
I PARTIED WITH CHINGY,

19:04.577 --> 19:07.814
AND I SHARED A SANDWICH
WITH A HOMELESS GUY.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.282
I'VE DONE IT ALL.

19:11.551 --> 19:15.288
NO MORE CURFEWS
AND NO MORE RULES.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.257
I'M AN ADULT.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.595
GEORGE, ANGIE...

19:22.595 --> 19:25.598
TOMORROW NIGHT,
I'M GOING OUT.

19:32.239 --> 19:35.642
DID SHE JUST CALL ME
ANGIE?

19:35.642 --> 19:37.109
SHE'S RIGHT.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.878
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.580
THEY'RE WORSE.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.316
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO
DO WITH HER?

19:43.316 --> 19:44.717
SHE'S IN HER OWN BED NOW.

19:44.717 --> 19:49.389
LET'S JUST TRY TO HAVE
ONE NIGHT OF PEACE.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.090
Man: AND IN A FINAL ACT
OF DOMINANCE,

19:51.090 --> 19:53.560
THE PARENT CHIMP BASHES
THE ADOLESCENT CHIMP

19:53.560 --> 19:55.628
WITH A ROCK IN THE HEAD,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.730
ENDING HIS BRIEF LIFE.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.866
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
DON'T CHANGE IT.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.234
I LIKE THIS SHOW.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.839
YOU KNOW,
IF I'D HAVE REALIZED

20:06.839 --> 20:08.641
HOW MUCH IT WORRIED
MY PARENTS,

20:08.641 --> 20:10.743
I NEVER WOULD HAVE RUN AWAY
WHEN I WAS A KID.

20:10.743 --> 20:15.815
CHASING THE ICE-CREAM MAN,
ERNIE, IS NOT RUNNING AWAY.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.084
I RAN AWAY ONCE.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.253
I WAS GONE FOR THREE WEEKS.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.121
WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE
TO COME HOME?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.656
OH, I FINALLY FIGURED OUT

20:23.656 --> 20:26.526
HOW TO GET OUT
OF THAT TRUCKER'S CAB.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.996
I BET HE LEFT
THE DOOR OPEN.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.364
EVEN A SERIAL KILLER KNOWS

20:31.364 --> 20:33.766
WHEN HE'S BITTEN OFF
MORE THAN HE CAN CHEW.

20:33.766 --> 20:36.903
OH, NO, HE FELL ASLEEP
AT A REST STOP,

20:36.903 --> 20:40.907
AND I HIT HIM
WITH HIS OWN THERMOS...

20:40.907 --> 20:42.775
47 TIMES.

20:44.844 --> 20:49.282
THERE'S SOME LETTUCE THAT NEVER
MADE IT TO BAKERSFIELD.

20:49.282 --> 20:53.820
I HAVE THE GREATEST
RUNNING-AWAY STORY OF ALL,

20:53.820 --> 20:57.824
BUT I WAS RUNNING
TO SOMETHING.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.626
I LEFT MOTHER CUBA...

21:01.294 --> 21:04.731
...FOR FATHER FREEDOM.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.065
IT WAS 1961...

21:06.065 --> 21:07.066
FOLD.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.735
FOLD.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.070
WHERE IS MY THERMOS?
