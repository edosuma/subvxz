01:17.102 --> 01:20.837
Ten centuries ago,
before the Age of Obedience,

01:20.839 --> 01:24.776
free dogs roamed at liberty,
marking their territory.

01:24.778 --> 01:27.010
Seeking to extend
its dominion,

01:27.012 --> 01:30.280
<i>the cat-loving
Kobayashi Dynasty declared war</i>

01:30.282 --> 01:31.715
<i>and descended in force</i>

01:31.717 --> 01:34.084
<i>upon the unwary
four-legged beasts.</i>

01:34.086 --> 01:37.388
<i>On the eve
of total canine annihilation,</i>

01:37.390 --> 01:39.892
<i>a child warrior
sympathetic to the plight</i>

01:39.894 --> 01:41.758
<i>of the besieged underdog dogs</i>

01:41.760 --> 01:43.460
<i>betrayed his species,</i>

01:43.462 --> 01:46.230
<i>beheaded the head of the head
of the Kobayashi clan</i>

01:46.233 --> 01:47.532
and pledged his sword

01:47.534 --> 01:49.935
with the following
battle-cry haiku.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.204
I turn my back

01:53.206 --> 01:54.837
On man-kind!

01:54.839 --> 01:56.707
Frost on window-pane.

01:56.709 --> 01:58.076
He would later be known

01:58.078 --> 02:01.611
as the Boy Samurai
of Legend, RIP.

02:01.614 --> 02:03.748
At the end
of the bloody dog wars,

02:03.750 --> 02:07.552
the vanquished mongrels
became powerless house-pets:

02:07.554 --> 02:11.788
<i>tamed, mastered, scorned.</i>

02:11.790 --> 02:14.561
<i>But they survived
and multiplied.</i>

02:15.661 --> 02:18.998
<i>The Kobayashis, however,</i>

02:19.000 --> 02:21.234
<i>never forgave
their conquered foe.</i>

03:41.815 --> 03:43.914
<i>The Japanese archipelago,</i>

03:43.916 --> 03:45.819
<i>20 years in the future.</i>

04:13.979 --> 04:15.379
<i>Canine Saturation</i>

04:15.381 --> 04:17.613
<i>has reached
epidemic proportions.</i>

04:17.616 --> 04:19.016
<i>An outbreak of Snout-fever</i>

04:19.017 --> 04:20.784
<i>rips through
the City of Megasaki.</i>

04:20.786 --> 04:24.021
<i>Blizzards of infected fleas,
worms, ticks and lice</i>

04:24.023 --> 04:25.688
<i>menace the citizenship.</i>

04:25.690 --> 04:28.660
<i>Dog-Flu threatens to cross
the species threshold</i>

04:28.662 --> 04:30.460
<i>and enter
the human disease-pool.</i>

04:33.232 --> 04:34.830
<i>In a special midnight-session</i>

04:34.832 --> 04:36.235
<i>at the Municipal Dome,</i>

04:36.237 --> 04:37.934
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
of Uni Prefecture</i>

04:37.937 --> 04:39.504
<i>issues emergency orders</i>

04:39.506 --> 04:41.570
<i>calling for
a hasty quarantine:</i>

04:41.572 --> 04:43.707
<i>the expulsion and containment
of all breeds,</i>

04:43.709 --> 04:45.677
<i>both stray and domesticated.</i>

04:45.679 --> 04:47.111
<i>By official decree,</i>

04:47.113 --> 04:49.282
<i>Trash Island
becomes an exile colony.</i>

04:49.284 --> 04:50.584
BANISH ALL DOGS.

04:51.008 --> 04:53.908
Save Megasaki City of Uni Prefecture!

04:56.455 --> 04:58.858
<i>The Isle of Dogs.</i>

05:08.034 --> 05:09.968
Respect-o.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.318
<i>It's not fair to the dogs.</i>

05:27.587 --> 05:29.753
<i>The path favored
by Mayor Kobayashi</i>

05:29.755 --> 05:32.090
<i>is cruel and unscientific.</i>

05:32.092 --> 05:33.390
<i>For a thousand years,</i>

05:33.392 --> 05:34.958
<i>these resilient animals
have loved,</i>

05:34.960 --> 05:36.461
<i>served and protected us.</i>

05:36.463 --> 05:38.428
<i>Now, in their time
of greatest need,</i>

05:38.430 --> 05:39.997
<i>we forsake them again?</i>

05:39.999 --> 05:42.265
<i>A tidal-wave
of Anti-Dog hysteria</i>

05:42.268 --> 05:44.569
<i>has crippled
our moral judgment.</i>

05:44.571 --> 05:46.904
<i>Give me six months,
and I will deliver a serum.</i>

05:46.907 --> 05:48.705
<i>I'm this close, dammit.</i>

05:48.707 --> 05:52.510
<i>Dog-Flu will be eradicated.
Snout-fever will be defeated.</i>

05:52.512 --> 05:53.876
<i>Canine Saturation
will be returned</i>

05:53.878 --> 05:55.178
<i>to sustainable levels</i>

05:55.180 --> 05:56.983
<i>and without mass-neutering!</i>

06:04.391 --> 06:07.894
Whatever happened
to man's best friend?

06:19.872 --> 06:21.406
No, no, no!

06:21.408 --> 06:22.940
The crowd is calling
for the immediate ratification

06:22.943 --> 06:24.941
and approval
of the mayor's proposal.

06:29.783 --> 06:32.050
<i>As a
gesture of public solidarity,</i>

06:32.052 --> 06:33.617
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
is calling upon</i>

06:33.619 --> 06:35.420
<i>his Assistant Hatchet-Man,
Major-Domo,</i>

06:35.422 --> 06:37.554
<i>to furnish
the personal bodyguard-dog</i>

06:37.556 --> 06:38.722
<i>of the mayoral-household,</i>

06:38.724 --> 06:40.158
<i>Spots Kobayashi,</i>

06:40.160 --> 06:41.292
<i>into the possession
of the Committee</i>

06:41.294 --> 06:43.863
<i>for Canine Desaturation.</i>

06:44.863 --> 06:46.364
<i>Spots will be the first dog</i>

06:46.366 --> 06:48.368
<i>to be officially deported
from the city.</i>

08:34.139 --> 08:36.342
<i>Six months later.</i>

08:55.362 --> 08:57.761
<i>Nomadic packs
of once-domesticated</i>

08:57.763 --> 08:59.329
<i>house-pets, sick and hungry,</i>

08:59.331 --> 09:01.598
<i>rove the garbage canyons
and filthy ravines,</i>

09:01.600 --> 09:03.434
<i>scrounging for scraps.</i>

09:03.436 --> 09:05.369
<i>One hundred per cent
test positive</i>

09:05.371 --> 09:07.170
<i>for the Dog-Flu germ.</i>

09:07.172 --> 09:11.407
<i>Symptoms:
weight-loss, dizziness,</i>

09:11.409 --> 09:14.177
<i>narcolepsy, insomnia,</i>

09:14.179 --> 09:16.515
<i>and extreme/aggressive
behavior.</i>

09:19.684 --> 09:23.286
<i>Three-quarters display signs
of early-onset Snout-fever:</i>

09:23.289 --> 09:26.023
<i>high-temperature,
low blood-pressure,</i>

09:26.025 --> 09:27.423
<i>acute moodiness</i>

09:27.425 --> 09:30.327
<i>and spasmodic
nasal expiration.</i>

09:30.329 --> 09:34.501
<i>The exiled dog-population
grows weaker, sadder, angrier.</i>

09:37.837 --> 09:39.371
<i>Desperate.</i>

10:17.875 --> 10:19.375
Hey, wait a second.

10:19.377 --> 10:21.178
Before we attack each other
and tear ourselves to shreds

10:21.180 --> 10:22.879
like a pack of maniacs,

10:22.881 --> 10:25.382
let's just open the sack first
and see what's actually in it.

10:25.384 --> 10:28.384
It might not even
be worth the trouble.

10:28.386 --> 10:30.620
What do you say?
I'm not sure.

10:30.623 --> 10:32.122
Maybe.

10:32.124 --> 10:33.693
Alright.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.029
A rancid apple core;
two worm-eaten banana peels;

10:39.031 --> 10:40.431
a moldy rice cake;
a dried-up pickle;

10:40.433 --> 10:42.299
tin of sardine bones;
a pile of broken egg-shells;

10:42.301 --> 10:43.399
an old, smushed-up,
rotten gizzard

10:43.401 --> 10:44.801
with maggots all over it...

10:44.803 --> 10:46.706
Okay, it's worth it.

10:54.481 --> 10:57.484
Get out of here
and don't come back.

11:01.654 --> 11:05.225
Sheesh, Igor. I think
he chewed your ear off.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.761
Hmm... Hmm.

11:38.390 --> 11:41.191
I don't think I can stomach
any more of this garbage.

11:41.193 --> 11:43.427
Same here.
Words out of my mouth.

11:43.429 --> 11:45.461
I used to sleep
on a lamb's-wool bean-bag

11:45.463 --> 11:46.797
next to
an electric space-heater.

11:46.799 --> 11:49.398
That's my territory.
I'm an indoor dog.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.935
I starred in 22 consecutive
Doggy-Chop commercials.

11:51.937 --> 11:54.470
Look at me now.
I couldn't land an audition.

11:54.472 --> 11:56.073
I was the lead mascot

11:56.075 --> 11:58.407
for an undefeated high-school
baseball team.

11:58.409 --> 12:00.711
I lost all my spirit.
I'm depressing.

12:00.713 --> 12:02.646
I only ask
for what I've always had:

12:02.648 --> 12:04.681
a balanced diet,
regular grooming,

12:04.683 --> 12:07.349
and a general physical
once a year.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.688
I think I might give up.

12:10.556 --> 12:13.859
What, right now?
Right now.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.828
There's no future
on Trash Island.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.897
You heard the rumor,
right? About Buster.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.230
Not sure.
Can you remind me?

12:21.232 --> 12:22.366
Who's Buster?

12:22.368 --> 12:23.734
Uh, my brother
from another litter.

12:23.736 --> 12:26.235
What happened to him?
Suicided.

12:26.237 --> 12:28.973
Hanged himself
by his own leash.

12:28.975 --> 12:30.776
- Hmm.
- Oh, boy.

12:32.276 --> 12:34.344
I want my master.

12:34.346 --> 12:37.918
Ah...

12:39.050 --> 12:41.587
You make me sick.

12:43.756 --> 12:48.225
I've seen cats
with more balls than you dogs.

12:48.227 --> 12:50.297
Stop licking your wounds!

12:52.231 --> 12:54.498
You hungry?
Kill something and eat it.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.500
You sick? Take a long nap.

12:56.502 --> 12:58.402
You cold?
Dig a hole in the ground,

12:58.404 --> 12:59.835
crawl into it,
and bury yourself.

12:59.837 --> 13:02.272
But nobody's giving up
around here,

13:02.274 --> 13:04.241
and don't you forget it, ever.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.709
You're Rex!

13:05.711 --> 13:06.778
You're King!

13:06.780 --> 13:07.945
You're Duke!

13:07.948 --> 13:09.079
You're Boss!

13:09.081 --> 13:10.748
I'm Chief.

13:10.750 --> 13:14.418
We're a pack of scary,
indestructible Alpha Dogs.

13:14.420 --> 13:19.822
You're talking like a bunch
of house-broken... pets.

13:19.824 --> 13:23.796
You don't understand.
Uh, how could you? You're a...

13:25.899 --> 13:30.270
Go ahead, say it.
I'm a stray, yeah.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.731
How does she keep
her fur so clean?

14:01.733 --> 14:04.533
There's no shampoo
on Trash Island.

14:04.535 --> 14:07.437
You heard the rumor, right?
About her and Felix.

14:07.439 --> 14:08.705
What'd they say?
Felix? No.

14:08.707 --> 14:10.974
What happened to them?
They mated.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.809
Ooh.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.545
Who is Felix again?

14:14.548 --> 14:17.046
All the ones I like:
they're never in heat.

14:17.048 --> 14:20.551
Hey, now, that puddle-jumper's
flying crooked.

14:20.554 --> 14:21.852
- Oh, you're right.
- Ease up.

14:21.854 --> 14:23.822
Pull up.
He's gonna lose a wing.

14:39.071 --> 14:41.007
Wow.

15:06.899 --> 15:09.302
<i>Part One:
The Little Pilot."</i>

15:11.370 --> 15:12.868
Small guy.
Not much meat on him.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.037
Yeah, is he dead?

15:14.039 --> 15:15.504
He looks dead.
I have a question.

15:15.506 --> 15:17.542
Are we eating him,
or is this a rescue?

15:17.544 --> 15:18.808
We don't know yet.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.476
Nobody's eating
the little pilot.

15:20.478 --> 15:22.311
Not even the dead body of him.
Dogs don't eat masters.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.747
You're not our leader.
We all are. Let's take a vote.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.517
All in favor of not eating
the little pilot, say "Aye".

15:27.519 --> 15:29.286
- Aye.
- Nay.

15:40.366 --> 15:41.631
First-things-first:

15:41.634 --> 15:43.032
let's open his helmet

15:43.034 --> 15:44.201
so he can breathe
some air if he's alive,

15:44.203 --> 15:45.435
then see if we can pull that

15:45.437 --> 15:47.004
hunk of
broken propeller-clutch

15:47.006 --> 15:48.739
out of the side of his head
if it doesn't kill him.

15:48.741 --> 15:50.474
- Does that sound right?
- Yeah, that's right.

15:50.476 --> 15:51.811
Mmm-hmm.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.639
Spots-u! Spots-u! Spots-u!

16:22.107 --> 16:23.572
We get the idea.

16:23.574 --> 16:25.575
You're looking
for your lost dog, Spots.

16:25.577 --> 16:28.046
- Does anybody know him?
- Hmm. No.

16:28.048 --> 16:29.149
Uh-uh.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.689
Wow.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.854
In response to questions

17:10.856 --> 17:12.221
regarding the purported
disappearance

17:12.223 --> 17:13.557
of his ward Atari,

17:13.559 --> 17:15.826
Mayor Kobayashi offers
no comment

17:15.828 --> 17:17.560
<i>and urges reporters to respect</i>

17:17.563 --> 17:19.296
<i>the privacy of
the mayoral-household.</i>

17:19.298 --> 17:22.199
<i>Atari, aged 12, was last seen
early yesterday morning</i>

17:22.201 --> 17:24.567
<i>rolling a small airplane
onto a runway</i>

17:24.569 --> 17:26.702
<i>at Megasaki Executive Airport.</i>

17:29.340 --> 17:31.406
<i>24 hours later.</i>

17:53.264 --> 17:54.867
I bite.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.366
I beg your pardon.
Ignore that dog.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.469
He's got Snout-fever.

17:59.471 --> 18:01.674
Just please follow us.

18:08.047 --> 18:09.711
Now, I never met him,
but I asked around.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.079
I understand
he made a lot of friends.

18:11.081 --> 18:12.915
He had a very good-natured
temperament, I'm told.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.251
Of course,
you would know best.

18:14.253 --> 18:16.987
It's just a bit further
up here on the left.

18:16.989 --> 18:18.622
Anyway, as I say,
he seemed to have been

18:18.624 --> 18:20.088
an extremely pleasant animal.

18:20.090 --> 18:23.259
Unfortunately, nobody could
figure out

18:23.261 --> 18:24.897
how to open his dog-cage.

18:31.604 --> 18:33.937
<i>Three years earlier.</i>

18:33.939 --> 18:35.505
<i>The sole survivor
of last week's</i>

18:35.507 --> 18:36.873
<i>colossal
bullet-train disaster,</i>

18:36.875 --> 18:38.607
<i>a young boy named Atari,</i>

18:38.609 --> 18:40.143
<i>awoke from a deep-coma
early this morning</i>

18:40.145 --> 18:42.478
<i>to learn
of his parents' tragic deaths</i>

18:42.480 --> 18:43.946
<i>and also the intention</i>

18:43.948 --> 18:45.715
<i>of his distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,</i>

18:45.717 --> 18:47.116
<i>to personally adopt him</i>

18:47.118 --> 18:49.619
<i>as ward
to the mayoral-household.</i>

18:49.622 --> 18:51.254
<i>Upon his release
from Megasaki General,</i>

18:51.257 --> 18:53.723
<i>Atari who suffered the loss
of his right kidney</i>

18:53.725 --> 18:55.959
<i>and numerous broken bones
in the crash</i>

18:55.961 --> 18:57.427
<i>will live
in sequestered quarters</i>

18:57.429 --> 18:59.197
<i>within the confines
of Brick Mansion,</i>

18:59.199 --> 19:02.998
<i>where he will be educated
in solitude by private tutors.</i>

19:03.001 --> 19:04.799
<i>Atari has also been assigned
a security-detail</i>

19:04.801 --> 19:06.268
<i>for his own protection</i>

19:06.270 --> 19:08.237
<i>in the form of a highly
trained bodyguard-dog</i>

19:08.239 --> 19:11.274
<i>named Spots Kobayashi.</i>

19:26.125 --> 19:28.759
Um, you're my new master.

19:28.761 --> 19:31.229
My name is Spots.
I'm at your service.

19:31.231 --> 19:33.529
I'll be protecting
your welfare and safety

19:33.531 --> 19:35.065
on an ongoing-basis.

19:35.067 --> 19:38.170
In other words: I'm your dog.

19:57.257 --> 20:01.193
Bodyguard-dog! Not pet!

20:29.188 --> 20:31.922
I can hear you,
Master Atari.

20:38.395 --> 20:38.662
I can hear you.

20:38.664 --> 20:41.100
I can hear you.
I can hear you.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.016
Oh, no.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.218
You need a key.

23:52.691 --> 23:55.828
Where'd you get that?
What? I always had this.

23:57.296 --> 23:59.563
I stole it
off the dead skeleton.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.867
Oh, no.

24:04.736 --> 24:08.006
Hey! The wrong dog died!

24:09.773 --> 24:11.578
The wrong dog died!

24:28.160 --> 24:31.030
The wrong...
The wrong dog died.

24:34.531 --> 24:35.533
He's not Spots.

24:40.039 --> 24:42.242
Who is that?

24:52.417 --> 24:54.884
I can't smell him.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.546
This is child abuse.

27:03.548 --> 27:04.815
Chief, you fight
the robot-dog.

27:04.817 --> 27:06.248
Wait. What?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.550
King, Duke, Boss? You attack
the three dog-catchers.

27:07.552 --> 27:08.950
On it.
I'll guard the little pilot.

27:08.952 --> 27:10.287
On my command. Ready?

27:10.289 --> 27:11.386
Wait a second!

27:11.388 --> 27:12.755
I am not gonna fight
this robot!

27:12.757 --> 27:14.825
I'm against the little pilot,
remember?

27:14.827 --> 27:16.125
I don't even believe
in masters.

27:16.127 --> 27:17.427
You're the best in a scrap.

27:17.429 --> 27:18.960
We all know that.
You like to fight.

27:18.962 --> 27:20.062
Well, let's take a vote.

27:20.064 --> 27:21.329
All in favor of Chief

27:21.331 --> 27:22.398
fighting the robot-dog,
say "Aye".

27:22.400 --> 27:23.699
- Aye.
- Nay.

27:23.701 --> 27:24.702
Sic 'em.

28:55.527 --> 28:56.992
<i>My ward, Atari,</i>

28:56.995 --> 28:58.494
<i>has been kidnapped
against his will</i>

28:58.496 --> 29:02.230
<i>by a pack of disobedient,
contagious, infected animals.</i>

29:02.232 --> 29:04.600
<i>He will be rescued promptly,
returned to safety,</i>

29:04.602 --> 29:07.769
<i>and grounded for the duration
of his childhood years.</i>

29:07.771 --> 29:09.071
<i>His five dog-abductors</i>

29:09.073 --> 29:10.439
<i>have been identified
through the use</i>

29:10.441 --> 29:13.977
<i>of advanced Tooth-and-Tail
Recognition Software:</i>

29:13.979 --> 29:15.810
<i>They will, of course,
be captured</i>

29:15.812 --> 29:17.448
<i>and violently destroyed.</i>

29:34.531 --> 29:36.833
Chief ought to
get a check-up, too.

29:36.835 --> 29:38.837
He looks worse than anybody.

29:53.684 --> 29:56.117
I wish somebody
spoke his language.

30:01.558 --> 30:02.691
Sit-o!

30:02.694 --> 30:04.863
Well, I understood that.
Sit down.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.998
Sit-o!

30:09.000 --> 30:10.903
Chief! Sit!

30:12.136 --> 30:14.306
I don't sit.

30:15.174 --> 30:17.542
You're disobedient! Sit!

30:19.010 --> 30:20.546
No.

30:49.273 --> 30:52.578
I wouldn't drink that,
if I were you.

30:53.778 --> 30:56.712
It's full of toxic chemicals.

30:56.714 --> 30:58.547
How do you know?

30:58.549 --> 31:00.483
Because my sister-in-law
drank it,

31:00.485 --> 31:01.986
and her tongue turned black.

31:03.321 --> 31:05.354
Oh.

31:05.356 --> 31:07.725
You're Felix's mate.

31:09.059 --> 31:10.525
I beg your pardon?

31:10.527 --> 31:12.762
I mean, I think you mated

31:12.764 --> 31:14.666
with Felix,
if I heard it right?

31:16.334 --> 31:18.134
That's none of your business.

31:18.136 --> 31:20.303
No, no, I don't suggest

31:20.306 --> 31:21.605
whether it actually
happened or not.

31:21.607 --> 31:24.105
I'm just saying
that I recognize you

31:24.107 --> 31:26.577
from when I heard that rumor.

31:29.514 --> 31:31.247
I think I'm going
to say good-night.

31:31.249 --> 31:32.781
Wait, wait, wait. No.

31:32.783 --> 31:35.152
Wait. Start over.
Who cares about Felix?

31:35.154 --> 31:38.823
I'm Chief.
That's my name.

31:39.791 --> 31:42.358
I see.

31:42.360 --> 31:45.630
I'm introducing myself.
Who are you?

31:47.598 --> 31:48.964
I thought you knew
all about me.

31:48.967 --> 31:51.535
No, I don't know anything.

31:51.537 --> 31:52.803
I should've kept
my mouth shut.

31:52.805 --> 31:53.701
It's all hearsay.

31:53.704 --> 31:56.809
Anyway, you're Nutmeg.

31:58.241 --> 32:00.577
So you do know me, after all.

32:01.412 --> 32:03.748
After all? Yes.

32:05.249 --> 32:07.318
You a show-dog, Nutmeg?

32:08.353 --> 32:09.652
I was bred as a show-dog.

32:09.654 --> 32:11.420
I was groomed
for that purpose.

32:11.422 --> 32:12.655
It wasn't my choice.

32:12.657 --> 32:14.523
I don't consider it
my identity.

32:14.525 --> 32:17.393
Anyway, look around.

32:17.395 --> 32:19.698
What difference
does it make now?

32:20.366 --> 32:22.665
So that's a yes.

32:22.667 --> 32:26.472
So that's a:
yes, I used to be.

32:28.373 --> 32:29.642
May I join you?

32:36.180 --> 32:38.145
You've been attacked.

32:38.147 --> 32:41.149
Hmm. What else is new?
You should see the other dog.

32:41.151 --> 32:42.518
Actually,

32:42.520 --> 32:43.885
I think he was made
of stainless-steel.

32:43.887 --> 32:45.688
I couldn't get my teeth
into him.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.758
Who is the little pilot?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.794
What'd he do?
Why are they after him?

32:51.029 --> 32:53.431
Nobody knows.

32:58.604 --> 33:01.337
You're a stray, aren't you?

33:01.339 --> 33:03.572
Yes, I'm a stray.

33:03.574 --> 33:06.946
But aren't we all?
In the last analysis, I mean?

33:08.445 --> 33:11.347
Were you trained?
For competition.

33:11.349 --> 33:12.914
I was a show-dog.

33:12.916 --> 33:16.018
You know a few tricks, then.
A few.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.920
Can I see one?

33:17.922 --> 33:20.323
Maybe if I get to
know you better.

33:20.326 --> 33:23.291
Fair enough.

33:23.293 --> 33:24.995
It's not true, by the way.

33:24.997 --> 33:27.031
About me and Felix.
For the record.

33:28.434 --> 33:30.970
I wouldn't bring puppies
into this world.

33:32.003 --> 33:34.538
I don't believe in masters.
I never did.

33:34.540 --> 33:35.837
It's against my principles.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.673
But this is no place
for a dog like you.

33:38.675 --> 33:42.447
You belong somewhere.
You've got papers.

33:43.481 --> 33:44.947
Oh, I'm full-grown,
sweetheart.

33:44.949 --> 33:47.152
You don't have to worry
about me.

33:48.019 --> 33:49.555
Good-night.

33:52.624 --> 33:54.125
I hope I'll see you again.

33:57.795 --> 34:00.064
- Here's one.
- One what?

34:04.969 --> 34:06.802
I'm supposed to be spinning
a nine-pound bowling-ball

34:06.804 --> 34:08.002
over my head at this point,

34:08.005 --> 34:10.174
but you just have to
imagine that part.

34:11.876 --> 34:13.175
Oh.

34:13.177 --> 34:15.911
I can picture it.

34:15.913 --> 34:19.081
Will you help him?
The little pilot?

34:20.118 --> 34:21.614
Why should I?

34:21.617 --> 34:24.253
Because he's
a 12-year-old boy.

34:24.255 --> 34:26.458
Dogs love those.

34:29.793 --> 34:31.257
<i>Spots, whoever he is,</i>

34:31.260 --> 34:32.827
<i>might be alive,
and he might be dead,</i>

34:32.829 --> 34:34.496
<i>but one thing's for sure:</i>

34:34.498 --> 34:35.966
he's nowhere around here.

34:35.967 --> 34:37.967
He's not in the dog-community.

34:37.969 --> 34:40.302
There's probably another
500 Japanese hectares

34:40.304 --> 34:41.635
of unmapped waste-land

34:41.637 --> 34:43.639
on Trash Island at least.

34:43.641 --> 34:45.172
Where do we start?

34:45.175 --> 34:47.609
Also,
the mental health question:

34:47.610 --> 34:49.077
maybe it's because of that

34:49.079 --> 34:50.346
propeller-clutch stuck
in the side of his head

34:50.348 --> 34:51.847
I can't say, I'm not a doctor,

34:51.849 --> 34:55.150
but I think the little pilot's
got a screw loose.

34:55.152 --> 34:56.784
Those are the cons.

34:56.786 --> 34:58.888
You heard the rumor, right?
About the little pilot.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.454
Which rumor?
What is that?

35:00.456 --> 35:03.060
Kobayashi is
his distant uncle.

35:03.062 --> 35:04.528
He's the mayor's ward.

35:04.530 --> 35:06.762
- What?
- Whoa.

35:06.764 --> 35:08.797
Be that as it may,
let's look at the pros.

35:08.799 --> 35:10.066
That boy flew here, all alone,

35:10.068 --> 35:11.565
and crash-landed
onto this island

35:11.567 --> 35:13.735
for one reason;
one reason only:

35:13.737 --> 35:15.538
to find his dog.

35:15.540 --> 35:17.239
To the best of my knowledge,
no other master,

35:17.241 --> 35:19.008
not one single human master,

35:19.010 --> 35:20.976
has made any effort
to do that.

35:20.979 --> 35:23.845
They've forgotten
all about us.

35:23.847 --> 35:27.148
I propose we start tomorrow,
first-light.

35:27.150 --> 35:28.917
<i>We'll cross
the Middle Fingers.</i>

35:28.919 --> 35:30.952
<i>We'll find the tugboat
on the Dune.</i>

35:30.954 --> 35:32.555
<i>We'll go see Jupiter
and Oracle.</i>

35:32.557 --> 35:34.058
<i>They'll know what to do.</i>

35:35.660 --> 35:37.560
Let's take a vote.
All in favor say "Aye".

35:37.562 --> 35:39.061
- Aye.
- Nay.

35:39.063 --> 35:40.029
Who's the nay-sayer?

35:40.031 --> 35:42.464
- Him.
- Me.

35:42.466 --> 35:47.702
That kid is gonna get us all
put to sleep. Euthanized.

35:47.704 --> 35:49.908
We won't find the dog,

35:50.808 --> 35:53.011
but we will die trying.

35:54.646 --> 35:57.882
Not a bad way to go.
You're out-voted, anyway.

36:03.454 --> 36:04.754
<i>Science-Party Candidate</i>

36:04.756 --> 36:06.255

36:36.286 --> 36:38.421
Thank you, Editor-Hiroshi.

36:38.423 --> 36:40.156
You all know me.
I speak my mind,

36:40.158 --> 36:41.856
and sometimes
that ruffles some feathers.

36:41.858 --> 36:43.758
Please, forgive my bluntness.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.195
Mayor Kobayashi is a crook,
and I hate him.

36:46.197 --> 36:48.095
Right now,
he faces a divided congress

36:48.097 --> 36:50.366
during a hotly-contested
re-election year.

36:50.368 --> 36:53.369
Dogs are dying
on a miserable island.

36:53.371 --> 36:55.972
Gullible masters
have been brainwashed.

36:55.975 --> 36:58.642
The Science-Party Candidate
is being held against his will

36:58.644 --> 37:01.943
with no recourse
to legal counsel.

37:01.945 --> 37:04.746
Somebody is up to something.

37:08.318 --> 37:11.121
You have
a conspiracy theory?

37:12.856 --> 37:15.093
I have a hunch.

37:16.425 --> 37:18.492
I don't print hunch.

37:20.963 --> 37:22.166
Huh?

37:22.900 --> 37:24.999
I'll spell it out.

37:25.002 --> 37:27.203
I believe
Municipal Dome propaganda

37:27.205 --> 37:30.338
has deliberately stoked
irrational, Anti-Dog fear

37:30.340 --> 37:33.175
and suppressed a medically
proven Dog-Flu treatment

37:33.177 --> 37:35.242
in order to promote
a secret campaign

37:35.244 --> 37:39.280
to turn the country against
its innocent house-pets.

37:39.282 --> 37:41.418
There. I said it.

37:44.222 --> 37:46.157
Can you prove it?

37:54.499 --> 37:56.197
I don't know.

37:56.199 --> 37:58.403
To tell you the truth:
I don't know.

38:13.483 --> 38:16.352
<i>Part Two:

39:26.623 --> 39:30.125
Okay, I got a question.
What's your favorite food?

39:30.127 --> 39:32.027
A double-portion
of Doggy-Chop from the can

39:32.030 --> 39:33.829
mixed into a bowl
of broken Puppy-Snaps

39:33.831 --> 39:35.295
with a vitamin
crushed up into it.

39:35.297 --> 39:37.398
King's the spokes-dog
for that.

39:37.401 --> 39:38.868
He's the Doggy-Chop dog.

39:38.870 --> 39:40.034
Mmm. Used to be.

39:40.037 --> 39:41.536
Was that
your daily meal?

39:41.538 --> 39:43.037
Not always. My master
was a school-teacher.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.973
We weren't rich,
you know. You?

39:44.975 --> 39:47.208
A center-cut Kobe
rib-eye, seared,

39:47.210 --> 39:48.742
on the bone,
with salt and pepper.

39:48.744 --> 39:50.046
Wow.

39:50.048 --> 39:51.881
It was my birthday
supper. Every year.

39:51.883 --> 39:54.350
Mine's hot-sausage,
yakitori-style.

39:54.352 --> 39:57.485
The snack vendor always
saved me one on game-days.

39:57.487 --> 39:59.721
- Hmm. Duke?
- Ah, green-tea ice cream.

39:59.723 --> 40:01.123
My master had a sweet-tooth.

40:01.125 --> 40:02.757
I probably inherited it
from her.

40:04.094 --> 40:06.095
You heard the rumor, right?
About Doggy-Chop.

40:06.097 --> 40:07.829
Remind us again.
What rumor?

40:07.831 --> 40:10.699
Oh, they folded.
Oh, no.

40:10.702 --> 40:13.402
Doggy... Doggy-Chop folded?

40:13.404 --> 40:16.805
How about you, Chief?
What was your favorite food?

40:16.807 --> 40:19.208
Me? Oh, I don't care.

40:19.210 --> 40:21.777
Garbage, trash,
scraps of rubbish.

40:21.779 --> 40:24.446
- I'm used to left-overs.
- Hmm.

40:24.448 --> 40:25.514
Yeah, yeah.

40:25.516 --> 40:28.048
Of course,
I wasn't always a stray.

40:28.050 --> 40:29.784
Wait. What'd you say?

40:29.786 --> 40:32.054
I said I wasn't always
a stray.

40:32.056 --> 40:34.258
- Really? Since when?
- Tell us about that.

40:42.367 --> 40:45.233
I've been hunted by
dog-catchers all my life.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.601
I'm not easy to trap.

40:46.603 --> 40:49.104
I've only got three captures
on my record

40:49.106 --> 40:51.107
where I actually got sent
to the pound, I mean,

40:51.109 --> 40:54.141
and the first two times,
I escaped within 24 hours,

40:54.143 --> 40:56.679
but the third time...

40:56.681 --> 40:58.214
I got adopted before I could

40:58.216 --> 41:00.582
finish digging
the break-out-tunnel.

41:00.584 --> 41:01.850
It was a big family.

41:01.852 --> 41:04.120
Five kids.
Two other dogs, already.

41:04.122 --> 41:05.987
They stuck me
in the back of a station-wagon

41:05.989 --> 41:08.389
and drove me out
to the middle of the sticks.

41:08.392 --> 41:12.161
Grass, trees, swimming pool.
Cartoons on TV.

41:12.163 --> 41:15.230
Anyway, one morning
a week later,

41:15.232 --> 41:17.133
the youngest boy,
his name was Toshiro,

41:17.135 --> 41:20.936
woke me up at 6:15,
bright-eyed, wide-awake,

41:20.938 --> 41:25.341
and he tried to pet me.

41:25.343 --> 41:29.345
He didn't mean anything by it.
He was just being friendly.

41:29.347 --> 41:36.519
Apparently, I bit him so hard,
I nearly chewed his hand off.

41:36.521 --> 41:38.988
Blood all over
the kitchen floor.

41:38.990 --> 41:40.790
They rushed him
to the emergency room

41:40.792 --> 41:42.090
and I got pad-locked out

41:42.092 --> 41:43.858
in the tool-shed
with the lights out.

41:43.860 --> 41:46.226
It gave me some time to think.

41:46.228 --> 41:49.865
What happened?
Why did I do that?

41:49.867 --> 41:53.101
To this day, I have no idea.

41:53.103 --> 41:55.606
I guess he scared me.

41:57.642 --> 41:59.912
I bite.

42:00.744 --> 42:02.844
That night, an old woman,

42:02.846 --> 42:04.446
she must've been
the grandmother

42:04.448 --> 42:07.249
brought me out a bowl of some
homemade hibachi-chili.

42:07.251 --> 42:08.383
I like to think she cooked it

42:08.385 --> 42:10.052
for me,
personally -but who knows?

42:10.054 --> 42:11.987
Maybe it was just
more left-overs. But...

42:11.990 --> 42:14.257
You've got a tick.

42:17.126 --> 42:20.262
Anyway, that's my favorite
food I ever ate.

42:20.264 --> 42:22.967
The old woman made
a great bowl of chili.

42:24.001 --> 42:25.766
What happened after that?

42:25.768 --> 42:27.203
I dug my way out by morning,

42:27.205 --> 42:28.837
jumped on the back
of a dump-truck,

42:28.839 --> 42:31.039
and hitched back to Megasaki.

42:31.041 --> 42:34.074
I was always a street-dog,
let's face it.

42:45.621 --> 42:47.625
Somebody's stalking us.

43:03.907 --> 43:06.907
<i>As you know, we all hate dogs.</i>

43:06.909 --> 43:08.376
<i>Chairman Fujimoto-san,</i>

43:08.378 --> 43:10.012
<i>President of
Kobayashi Pharmaceutical.</i>

43:10.014 --> 43:11.412
<i>You secretly introduced</i>

43:11.415 --> 43:12.947
<i>mega-quantities
of infected fleas</i>

43:12.949 --> 43:14.350
<i>and contagious tick-larvae</i>

43:14.352 --> 43:16.050
<i>into a metropolitan
city center,</i>

43:16.053 --> 43:19.254
<i>creating an unprecedented
animal-disease out-break.</i>

43:19.256 --> 43:20.355
<i>Thank you.</i>

43:20.357 --> 43:21.991
<i>General Yamatachi-san,</i>

43:21.993 --> 43:23.993
<i>Commander of the Megasaki
Municipal Task force.</i>

43:23.995 --> 43:27.929
<i>You oversaw the deportation
of over 750,000 caged-animals</i>

43:27.931 --> 43:31.267
<i>to a nearly uninhabitable
off-shore refuse-center.</i>

43:31.269 --> 43:32.435
<i>Good work.</i>

43:32.437 --> 43:34.068
<i>Supervisor Kitano-san,</i>

43:34.071 --> 43:35.771
<i>Director
of Kobayashi Robotics.</i>

43:35.773 --> 43:37.805
<i>You developed the most
promising artificial life-form</i>

43:37.807 --> 43:39.709
<i>in the history
of corporate-technology-</i>

43:39.711 --> 43:42.078
<i>and a powerful new weapon,
to boot.</i>

43:42.080 --> 43:43.345
<i>Well done.</i>

43:43.348 --> 43:44.714
<i>Yakuza Nakamura-san,</i>

43:44.716 --> 43:46.347
<i>Head of
the Clenched-Fist Gang.</i>

43:46.350 --> 43:48.249
<i>You eliminated
all Pro-Dog opposition</i>

43:48.251 --> 43:49.784
<i>through the use of bribery,</i>

43:49.786 --> 43:52.387
<i>extortion, intimidation,
and violent force.</i>

43:52.389 --> 43:55.791
<i>My compliments.</i>

43:55.793 --> 43:59.161
<i>Brains have been washed.
Wheels have been greased.</i>

43:59.163 --> 44:00.595
<i>Fear has been mongered.</i>

44:00.597 --> 44:02.098
<i>Now we prepare
for the final stage</i>

44:02.100 --> 44:03.665
<i>of our conspiracy-theory:</i>

44:03.667 --> 44:04.834
<i>the permanent end</i>

44:04.836 --> 44:07.237
<i>to the Canine
Saturation-crisis.</i>

44:16.813 --> 44:19.981
<i>We believe we've
recovered a viable DNA sample</i>

44:19.983 --> 44:23.450
<i>from this article
of damaged aviation equipment.</i>

44:23.452 --> 44:24.786
<i>We're going to check it
right now</i>

44:24.788 --> 44:26.658
<i>if you care to observe.</i>

44:49.311 --> 44:51.247
We call upon
dog-lovers everywhere

44:51.249 --> 44:53.548
to harken
to this transmission:

44:55.419 --> 44:56.918
May-day! May-day!

44:56.920 --> 44:58.686
Unscheduled Junior Turbo-Prop

44:58.689 --> 45:00.787
in severe distress
over Sapporo River.

45:00.790 --> 45:02.456
Engine-failure, and-

45:02.458 --> 45:04.025
-detachment of left wing.

45:04.027 --> 45:07.095
Will attempt emergency-landing
on Trash Island coast.

45:07.097 --> 45:08.929
Please, make note
of the following:

45:08.931 --> 45:10.865
<i>to my security-detail /
bodyguard-dog,</i>

45:10.867 --> 45:12.833
<i>Spots Kobayashi,
if still living,</i>

45:12.835 --> 45:16.004
<i>I leave
all my worldly possessions.</i>

45:16.006 --> 45:18.505
<i>If Spots has preceded me
into the next life,</i>

45:18.507 --> 45:20.208
<i>I ask that everything,</i>

45:20.210 --> 45:22.744
<i>including my own bones
and Spots' carcass,</i>

45:22.746 --> 45:25.612
<i>be burned
in a crematory furnace,</i>

45:25.614 --> 45:28.115
<i>with our ashes scattered
to the four-winds.</i>

45:28.117 --> 45:31.485
<i>It will not amount to much
pollution in this sad land.</i>

45:31.487 --> 45:35.257
<i>If I survive,
ignore this message.</i>

45:35.259 --> 45:38.260
<i>I've gone to find my dog.</i>

45:38.262 --> 45:41.765
Young masters
of Megasaki: unite!

45:52.342 --> 45:53.976
Turpentine brandy.

45:53.978 --> 45:57.780
It cools the head
and warms the dog-bones.

46:00.017 --> 46:02.118
It may snow tonight.

46:02.120 --> 46:05.253
Really? Thank you
very much. Wow.

46:05.255 --> 46:07.756
To whom it may concern.

46:07.758 --> 46:11.726
- She sees the future.
- No.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.596
She understands T.V.

46:18.401 --> 46:21.705
You seek a dog named Spots.

46:25.909 --> 46:28.645
- Dog-Zero.
- Dog-Zero.

46:30.813 --> 46:33.481
As you know, most of
the animals on this island

46:33.483 --> 46:35.151
come from human homes

46:35.153 --> 46:36.952
with domesticated
back-grounds.

46:36.954 --> 46:40.787
However, a small population
of savage, aboriginal dogs

46:40.790 --> 46:42.090
have been scavenging

46:42.092 --> 46:43.357
the Metropolitan
Dumping-Grounds

46:43.359 --> 46:44.860
for nearly a decade.

46:44.862 --> 46:47.695
The graffiti on this wall
depicts the story.

46:47.698 --> 46:50.298
They were born into captivity
on the ends of the fringes

46:50.300 --> 46:52.032
of the most distant reaches
of the island.

46:52.034 --> 46:55.270
They endured
great suffering and cruelty

46:55.272 --> 46:57.638
at the hands
of their former masters.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.842
Finally, in the wake of
an Act of God, they escaped-

47:00.844 --> 47:03.645
to a harsh
and desperate freedom.

47:03.647 --> 47:06.481
<i>Some say they died away
over the subsequent years,</i>

47:06.483 --> 47:08.050
<i>starving and forgotten.</i>

47:08.052 --> 47:09.851
<i>Some say they swam
to the mainland,</i>

47:09.853 --> 47:13.720
<i>but this seems unlikely.
Too far to dog-paddle.</i>

47:13.723 --> 47:15.624
<i>Some say
they're still with us,</i>

47:15.627 --> 47:19.628
<i>in the Far-away Cuticles,
beyond the Middle Fingers.</i>

47:19.631 --> 47:22.665
We know the animal you seek.

47:22.667 --> 47:25.233
<i>He has appeared
in Oracle's visions.</i>

47:27.369 --> 47:29.906
A prophecy suggests itself:

47:31.507 --> 47:34.443
Spots, if he's alive,
may very well be living,

47:34.445 --> 47:37.110
even at this moment,
as a captive prisoner

47:37.113 --> 47:41.019
abducted into the company
of these wild, savage dogs.

47:42.051 --> 47:43.655
Oracle, what do you think?

47:45.957 --> 47:47.759
What?

47:49.493 --> 47:53.260
Continue your journey.
Have faith in your cause.

47:53.262 --> 47:55.798
Luck and good fortune
be unto you.

47:59.101 --> 48:02.570
You heard the rumor, right?
About these aboriginal dogs.

48:02.572 --> 48:05.106
- Remind me again.
- What's the rumor?

48:05.108 --> 48:07.007
Uh, they're cannibals.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.545
So you're telling me they're
going to want to eat us?

48:10.547 --> 48:12.750
Well, they're cannibals.

50:51.608 --> 50:53.408
We're approaching
the end of Old Trash Island.

50:53.410 --> 50:56.610
To the west: the Sapporo River
and Megasaki City.

50:56.612 --> 50:58.314
To the east: the open-sea.

50:58.316 --> 50:59.880
To the north: a long, rickety

50:59.882 --> 51:01.650
cause-way
over a noxious sludge-marsh

51:01.653 --> 51:03.486
leading to
a radio-active land-fill

51:03.488 --> 51:05.120
polluted by toxic
chemical-garbage.

51:05.122 --> 51:06.687
- That's our destination.
- Great.

51:06.689 --> 51:08.122
Got it.
Get ready to jump.

51:08.124 --> 51:09.791
Atari, I'm going to drag you
overboard with my teeth,

51:09.793 --> 51:11.025
since you can't understand
the plan.

51:11.028 --> 51:12.659
After that,
we're back on foot.

51:12.661 --> 51:14.028
The next stage...

51:14.031 --> 51:15.028
Where'd they...

51:15.030 --> 51:16.463
Where'd they go?

51:16.465 --> 51:17.530
What are they doing
over there?

51:17.532 --> 51:18.868
How did this happen?

51:18.870 --> 51:20.735
What's going on
with this contraption?

51:20.737 --> 51:22.769
If we get separated,
which we are:

51:22.772 --> 51:25.740
rendez-vous at the cause-way!

51:25.742 --> 51:28.476
You're not our leader!
What?

51:28.478 --> 51:30.677
You're not our leader!
We all are!

51:30.679 --> 51:32.446
Let's take a vote!

51:34.251 --> 51:35.949
All in favor of my plan,

51:35.951 --> 51:38.052
which is to rendez-vous
at the cause-way...

52:14.926 --> 52:16.928
Let's go.

52:26.802 --> 52:28.869
No, you can't ride
the Pagoda-Slide.

52:28.871 --> 52:31.808
You're below the safety-limit,
anyway. Let's go.

52:35.678 --> 52:37.212
We made an emergency plan,

52:37.214 --> 52:39.380
even if we didn't get to vote
and agree to it yet:

52:39.383 --> 52:41.882
rendez-vous at the cause-way
to the Far-away Cuticles,

52:41.884 --> 52:43.083
and go find your dog.

52:43.085 --> 52:44.918
Maybe everybody else
just got crushed,

52:44.920 --> 52:46.653
compacted, and incinerated-

52:46.655 --> 52:48.859
but we're going to be there.
Let's go.

52:56.199 --> 52:57.733
Don't.

52:59.034 --> 53:00.570
Repeat:

53:02.204 --> 53:04.173
don't.

53:07.711 --> 53:09.943
I am not your pet.
I never liked you.

53:09.945 --> 53:12.646
I don't care about you.
I won't wait for you.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.851
I bite.

53:17.522 --> 53:19.057
Good luck.

54:01.999 --> 54:05.065
Jerks. Come here.
Oh, do this. Do that.

54:05.067 --> 54:07.468
Our Masters. I'll do what I...

54:09.473 --> 54:10.974
Hmm...

54:52.783 --> 54:54.548
I suppose
if it was working right,

54:54.550 --> 54:56.019
we'd be dead already.

55:13.737 --> 55:16.006
Don't ask me
to fetch that stick.

55:20.576 --> 55:22.044
Fetch-i!

55:27.684 --> 55:29.183
Fetch-i!

55:29.185 --> 55:32.989
I'm telling you:
I don't fetch.

55:38.394 --> 55:41.228
Fetch-i!

55:41.230 --> 55:44.566
I'm not doing this
because you commanded me to.

55:44.568 --> 55:48.137
I'm doing it-
because I feel sorry for you.

56:01.516 --> 56:03.520
Good boy.

56:41.923 --> 56:43.289
Where'd you get that dog?

56:43.291 --> 56:45.825
He looks like me
with a pink nose.

56:45.827 --> 56:50.597
I come from a nine-dog litter,
but they drowned the sisters.

56:50.599 --> 56:51.901
We're not a rare breed:

56:51.903 --> 56:53.636
short-haired-Oceanic-
speckled-ear/

56:53.638 --> 56:54.936
sport-hound-mix.

56:54.938 --> 56:57.372
I'm getting confused now.

56:57.374 --> 56:59.543
My belly feels funny.

57:12.923 --> 57:14.926
Biscuit-o.

57:16.392 --> 57:21.429
I can't accept that.
It's for your dog.

57:25.534 --> 57:28.001
I've never been offered
a Puppy-Snap in my life.

57:28.003 --> 57:30.438
I don't even know
what they taste like.

57:30.440 --> 57:31.843
Okay, I'll try it.

57:33.776 --> 57:37.443
Crunchy. Salty.

57:37.445 --> 57:39.850
Supposedly, it cleans
your teeth.

57:41.184 --> 57:43.387
This is my new favorite food.

57:44.920 --> 57:46.456
Thank you.

58:36.006 --> 58:38.208
Cold up here tonight.

58:40.842 --> 58:42.377
We'll find him.

58:42.379 --> 58:47.581
Wherever he is, if he's alive:
we'll find your dog.

59:08.070 --> 59:09.336
Mayor Kobayashi,

59:09.338 --> 59:11.305
elected leader
of Megasaki City.

59:11.307 --> 59:14.074
For 150 years,
you and your ancestors,

59:14.076 --> 59:16.244
known as
the Kobayashi Dynasty,

59:16.246 --> 59:18.144
a procession of
dog-hating thugs,

59:18.146 --> 59:20.614
stooges, felons,
and their criminal underlings,

59:20.616 --> 59:22.715
have betrayed and deceived
the citizens

59:22.717 --> 59:24.885
of Uni Prefecture.

59:24.887 --> 59:27.423
You make me so mad!

59:28.657 --> 59:30.058
Professor Watanabe,

59:30.060 --> 59:32.393
Science-Party Candidate,
deceased.

59:32.396 --> 59:34.394
The wasabi in your blood
showed poison-levels

59:34.397 --> 59:37.064
in excess of ten times
the maximum dosage required

59:37.066 --> 59:39.133
to stop the heart of a whale.

59:39.135 --> 59:42.936
Why'd you do it?

59:42.938 --> 59:47.108
Atari Kobayashi, adopted ward
to the mayoral-household.

59:47.110 --> 59:51.644
You heroically hi-jacked
a Junior Turbo-Prop XJ750

59:51.646 --> 59:54.417
and flew it to the island...

01:00:12.101 --> 01:00:13.535
Atari.

01:00:13.537 --> 01:00:15.302
You heroically,
as I was saying,

01:00:15.304 --> 01:00:19.340
stole the little airplane,
because of your dog and...

01:00:19.343 --> 01:00:22.412
I lost my train of thought.

01:00:23.546 --> 01:00:25.747
Dammit!

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:27.751
I've got a crush on you.

01:00:29.952 --> 01:00:32.356
<i>Part Three:
"The Rendez-Vous."</i>

01:00:58.179 --> 01:01:02.182
Rex! King! Duke! Boss!
You made it!

01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:05.786
What happened to you?
I took a bath.

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:09.092
What? He's got soap?
Just a little.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.191
You're too fluffy.

01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:13.393
- We played fetch.
- With a stick?

01:01:13.396 --> 01:01:15.497
With a hunk
of rubber radiator-tubing.

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:17.630
And you brought it back
to him?

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:19.266
Yeah.

01:01:19.268 --> 01:01:20.604
He's a good boy.

01:01:23.005 --> 01:01:24.438
Don't you tell me that!

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.140
I'm the one
that tried to make you

01:01:26.142 --> 01:01:27.675
be loyal to him,
in the first place.

01:01:27.678 --> 01:01:29.611
Stop. Stop!
This is the rendezvous.

01:01:29.613 --> 01:01:31.579
Where's that trash-tram
taking you?

01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:33.515
You think we booked this ride
through a travel agent?

01:01:33.517 --> 01:01:34.783
We were fighting for our lives

01:01:34.785 --> 01:01:36.416
in a high-velocity
trash-processor

01:01:36.419 --> 01:01:37.851
while you were getting
scrubbed and brushed.

01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:39.554
- Jump!
- Where?

01:01:39.556 --> 01:01:41.822
- Here!
- When?

01:01:41.824 --> 01:01:43.923
- Now!
- Why?

01:01:43.925 --> 01:01:46.093
What?
Let's take a vote.

01:01:46.095 --> 01:01:48.297
All in favor of jump...

01:01:55.805 --> 01:01:57.606
Who's that?

01:02:05.381 --> 01:02:07.416
I can't smell him.

01:02:49.659 --> 01:02:51.225
<i>Come in.</i>

01:02:51.227 --> 01:02:52.258
<i>Master Atari...
Can you hear me?</i>

01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:53.497
Huh?

01:03:15.718 --> 01:03:17.787
That dog's real.

01:03:24.627 --> 01:03:26.160
What's that thing
in your ear for?

01:03:26.162 --> 01:03:27.529
Are you hard of hearing?

01:03:27.531 --> 01:03:28.929
You can't be. Um...

01:03:28.931 --> 01:03:31.231
Bodyguard-dogs have to have
20/30-Auditory

01:03:31.233 --> 01:03:32.599
just to be certified.

01:03:32.601 --> 01:03:34.267
No, the ear-piece
is how I receive

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.869
my commands and instructions
and so on.

01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:38.704
Obviously, I'm privy to
certain sensitive information

01:03:38.706 --> 01:03:40.307
due to my position
in the mayoral-household

01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:41.908
at Brick Mansion.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:43.377
Oh, so you mean

01:03:43.379 --> 01:03:45.279
somebody could be talking
to you right now?

01:03:45.281 --> 01:03:49.349
Well, the range is only about
75 feet or so, I guess, so...

01:03:49.351 --> 01:03:50.583
Battery's probably dead,
anyway.

01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:52.020
I got a question for you.

01:03:52.022 --> 01:03:54.189
How much money
do you think the mayor makes?

01:03:54.191 --> 01:03:55.557
I can't tell you that.

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:57.691
That's highly confidential.

01:03:57.693 --> 01:04:00.126
Um, anyway, I'm not
the mayor's accountant's dog.

01:04:00.128 --> 01:04:01.260
That's Butterscotch,

01:04:01.262 --> 01:04:02.595
and she got crushed

01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:04.164
in a glass compactor
the day before yesterday.

01:04:04.166 --> 01:04:07.401
No, my duties
are, uh, focused entirely

01:04:07.403 --> 01:04:09.837
on the protection
of the mayor's ward, Atari.

01:04:09.839 --> 01:04:11.571
I'm not supposed
to be his friend,

01:04:11.573 --> 01:04:13.308
but I love him very much,

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.376
but that's a private matter.

01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:16.944
Um, the only reason
I even said that

01:04:16.946 --> 01:04:19.612
was because we're all probably
going to die out here

01:04:19.614 --> 01:04:23.083
and I'll never see him again.

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:28.589
That's a tough break.

01:04:28.591 --> 01:04:30.491
Well, good luck to you

01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:32.561
and watch out
for the cannibal-dogs.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:35.596
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

01:04:35.598 --> 01:04:37.831
- What?
- What?

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:41.166
Watch out for the...?
The cannibal-dogs.

01:04:41.168 --> 01:04:44.705
They are dogs that eat dogs.
Start over and repeat again.

01:04:44.707 --> 01:04:47.041
You know what?
Don't even worry about that.

01:04:47.044 --> 01:04:48.343
I just heard there might be

01:04:48.345 --> 01:04:50.043
some wild, aboriginal,
cannibal-dogs

01:04:50.046 --> 01:04:51.177
in the area, you know,

01:04:51.179 --> 01:04:52.378
but I wouldn't worry
because you're

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.280
in an extra-security
lock cell.

01:04:54.282 --> 01:04:55.517
Look at it that way.

01:04:55.519 --> 01:04:57.618
You're probably safer
than I am.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.822
Except from thirst
and starvation.

01:05:35.523 --> 01:05:37.624
It's got an extra-security
lock on it.

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:39.429
You'll never get it open.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:16.667
Are you going to eat me now?

01:06:17.968 --> 01:06:19.632
What did you say?

01:06:19.634 --> 01:06:21.435
Are you going to eat me now?

01:06:21.437 --> 01:06:22.903
I heard
you were cannibal-dogs.

01:06:22.905 --> 01:06:25.405
Be notified: I'll be compelled
to defend myself

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:27.978
with all means at my disposal.

01:06:33.783 --> 01:06:36.151
Hmm.

01:06:36.153 --> 01:06:39.423
Who told you that dirty lie?

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:48.162
We resorted to cannibalism
on one occasion,

01:06:48.164 --> 01:06:49.396
many months ago,

01:06:49.398 --> 01:06:51.130
as a desperate
survival instinct.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:53.766
We ate one single dog.

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.437
His name was Fuzzball,

01:06:55.439 --> 01:06:56.936
and he was the leader
of our pack,

01:06:56.938 --> 01:06:59.139
and he was already in a coma
from starvation,

01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:05.015
- so we put him out of his...
- his...

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:11.154
His misery and...

01:07:12.989 --> 01:07:14.523
and...

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:18.828
consumed him.

01:07:28.603 --> 01:07:30.503
We would have dropped dead
in a week or less

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:31.871
without that nourishment.

01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:34.944
We were dying.
Do you judge us for that?

01:07:35.543 --> 01:07:37.110
Shame on you!

01:07:37.113 --> 01:07:38.345
We only brought you here

01:07:38.347 --> 01:07:40.117
in the first place
to help you.

01:07:46.722 --> 01:07:48.689
We've got a Master Pass-Key!

01:07:48.691 --> 01:07:50.893
Open his cage.

01:08:04.975 --> 01:08:07.243
Fuzzball was his best friend.

01:08:16.419 --> 01:08:18.818
Oh, dear.
Uh, I think I offended him.

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:22.956
I'm truly sorry.
I had no idea.

01:08:22.957 --> 01:08:26.225
What is this place?
How long have you been here?

01:08:26.227 --> 01:08:29.029
I can see
you've been mistreated.

01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:35.171
Are you okay?

01:08:36.839 --> 01:08:41.006
My name is Spots.
Spots Kobayashi.

01:08:41.009 --> 01:08:43.813
How can I be of service
to you?

01:08:46.048 --> 01:08:48.649
Master Atari-san,
can you hear me?

01:08:48.652 --> 01:08:50.417
Can you hear me, Master Atari?

01:08:50.419 --> 01:08:51.716
Spots-u?

01:08:51.719 --> 01:08:52.919
You're not safe here!

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:54.154
You shouldn't have
come for me!

01:08:54.156 --> 01:08:55.854
I can't
protect you efficiently

01:08:55.857 --> 01:08:57.158
under these conditions!

01:09:07.902 --> 01:09:09.237
Spots-u!

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.274
<i>Here I come.</i>

01:09:29.058 --> 01:09:30.060
Sic-'em!

01:09:33.696 --> 01:09:35.232
<i>Follow me!</i>

01:09:47.442 --> 01:09:49.008
All in favor of kicking
Chief out of the pack

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:51.345
and never speaking
to him again, say "Aye".

01:09:51.348 --> 01:09:53.179
Aye!

01:09:55.217 --> 01:09:58.685
How did you do that?
Secret tooth! Military issue!

01:09:58.687 --> 01:10:00.752
Technically, I could do it
37 more times,

01:10:00.754 --> 01:10:03.422
but I wouldn't be able
to chew my meat!

01:10:03.425 --> 01:10:06.526
I assume you're Spots!
We've been looking for you.

01:10:14.636 --> 01:10:16.169
Master Atari-san,

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.305
I swore an oath when I assumed
the responsibilities

01:10:18.307 --> 01:10:21.007
of official bodyguard-dog
to the mayoral-household!

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:22.876
I could never be persuaded
to break that vow

01:10:22.878 --> 01:10:24.444
for any reason whatsoever!

01:10:24.447 --> 01:10:25.745
I'll always be loyal to you

01:10:25.747 --> 01:10:27.346
as my only
and unconditional master!

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.949
But circumstances
have radically changed for me

01:10:29.951 --> 01:10:32.219
and all the pets
of Megasaki City!

01:10:32.221 --> 01:10:34.520
I have new obligations
which I never anticipated!

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.824
I've become the leader
of a tribe of outcasts

01:10:36.826 --> 01:10:38.591
who depend on me
for their survival,

01:10:38.593 --> 01:10:41.928
and I'm going to be a father!

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:44.199
With deepest sadness
and humility:

01:10:44.201 --> 01:10:47.367
I must ask you to relieve me
of the duties of my position,

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:49.302
effective immediately.

01:10:49.304 --> 01:10:51.438
You son of a bitch.

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.940
If we don't drown, I'm going
to strangle you myself.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:55.975
I don't care
how many exploding teeth

01:10:55.977 --> 01:10:57.476
you try to spit-out at me.

01:10:57.479 --> 01:10:59.413
Do you have any idea

01:10:59.415 --> 01:11:00.948
what that little pilot
just went through

01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.515
to try to rescue you?

01:11:02.517 --> 01:11:03.786
How dare you?

01:11:05.986 --> 01:11:09.423
- You're a stray.
- Yeah, so what?

01:11:09.425 --> 01:11:10.857
What's your name?

01:11:10.859 --> 01:11:12.359
Who cares?

01:11:12.361 --> 01:11:15.229
You're from central Megasaki.
I can tell by the accent.

01:11:15.231 --> 01:11:18.398
You're a short-haired-Oceanic-
speckle-ear/sport-hound-mix.

01:11:18.401 --> 01:11:19.868
You were born in a storm-sewer

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:22.769
on Bamboo-shoot Holiday
six years ago today.

01:11:22.772 --> 01:11:24.136
Do you know me?

01:11:24.139 --> 01:11:27.373
I... I don't... I don't know.

01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:30.010
I'm your older brother
by five minutes.

01:11:30.012 --> 01:11:32.281
It's been a long time, Chief.

01:11:33.848 --> 01:11:36.886
Was... Was I the runt?

01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:40.089
Not anymore.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:51.165
<i>Security-camera footage</i>

01:11:51.167 --> 01:11:52.765
<i>confirms initial-reports</i>

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:55.200
<i>of the deaths of mayoral-ward
Atari Kobayashi</i>

01:11:55.202 --> 01:11:57.503
and his five dog-abductors
this afternoon

01:11:57.505 --> 01:11:58.872
in a sluice channel

01:11:58.874 --> 01:12:01.008
at the threshold
of the Far-Away Cuticles.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:03.777
A statement from Major-Domo,
live at Brick Mansion:

01:12:06.348 --> 01:12:08.881
The life
of a promising young orphan

01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:10.850
has been cut short
before its prime.

01:12:10.852 --> 01:12:13.287
This is a distant-uncle's
worst nightmare.

01:12:13.289 --> 01:12:16.923
Mayor Kobayashi asks for your
prayers, your condolences

01:12:16.925 --> 01:12:18.524
and your support
for the diligent men and women

01:12:18.526 --> 01:12:21.261
of the Municipal Task Force
Dog-Catchers Division:

01:12:21.263 --> 01:12:24.131
we salute you for your bravery
and your ongoing commitment

01:12:24.133 --> 01:12:27.369
to the continuing punishment
of all bad-dogs.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:36.142
Originally,
before the volcano erupted

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:37.644
and an earthquake
triggered the tsunami

01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:38.877
which obliterated
the facility,

01:12:38.879 --> 01:12:40.247
there were over 250

01:12:40.249 --> 01:12:42.048
incarcerated animals
here on the premises

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:44.383
being experimented on
against their will.

01:12:44.385 --> 01:12:46.320
If you look closely, you may
notice some of these dogs

01:12:46.322 --> 01:12:49.925
still bear scars and markings
from the research and abuse.

01:12:51.227 --> 01:12:53.793
Actually, it's pretty obvious.

01:12:53.795 --> 01:12:55.261
This is my mate, Peppermint.

01:12:55.263 --> 01:12:56.930
She's pregnant
with our first litter.

01:12:56.932 --> 01:12:58.699
She was due a week ago.

01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:03.403
Anyway,

01:13:03.406 --> 01:13:04.904
the survivors of the disaster
learned to cultiv...

01:13:04.906 --> 01:13:06.806
What's he got there?
What's he got there?

01:13:06.808 --> 01:13:10.610
Biscuit-o. Biscuit-o.
Biscuit-o.

01:13:10.612 --> 01:13:12.779
Puppy-Snaps.

01:13:12.782 --> 01:13:15.582
I heard they don't even
make them anymore.

01:13:15.584 --> 01:13:16.984
You heard the rumor, right?

01:13:16.986 --> 01:13:18.184
About Kobayashi
Pharmaceutical.

01:13:18.186 --> 01:13:19.887
I never heard it.
What rumor?

01:13:19.889 --> 01:13:21.888
They invented Dog-Flu.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.525
- No.
- Of course.

01:13:24.527 --> 01:13:25.825
That makes sense.

01:13:25.827 --> 01:13:27.193
Where do you get
all these rumors?

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:28.761
I mean,
who tells them to you?

01:13:28.763 --> 01:13:29.929
I don't know. Anybody.

01:13:29.931 --> 01:13:31.998
Dogs talk, and I listen.
Always have.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.900
I, uh, love gossip.

01:13:33.902 --> 01:13:35.171
Spots!

01:13:36.639 --> 01:13:39.605
The black owl has a message.

01:13:44.513 --> 01:13:46.512
He's come from all the way
across the island.

01:13:46.514 --> 01:13:48.581
Get him a cup
of sewer-water, Chico.

01:13:48.583 --> 01:13:50.551
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:50.553 --> 01:13:52.085
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:52.088 --> 01:13:53.619
Yes. We understand.

01:13:53.621 --> 01:13:55.756
He has news from the
Metropolitan Dumping-Grounds.

01:13:55.758 --> 01:13:59.492
Metropolitan...
Shh! Quiet, please.

01:13:59.494 --> 01:14:03.331
We're listening, owl.
Tell us your message.

01:14:08.003 --> 01:14:10.069
He's going to poison us.

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.571
Re-election Night:

01:14:11.573 --> 01:14:14.073
at the moment Mayor Kobayashi
is re-inaugurated,

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.476
he'll give the order,

01:14:15.478 --> 01:14:17.578
and the extermination-process
will begin.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.980
<i>Oracle saw the plan
in her visions.</i>

01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:23.716
<i>If the voters choose me again</i>

01:14:23.718 --> 01:14:25.151
<i>on Re-Election Night,</i>

01:14:25.153 --> 01:14:27.053
<i>I promise:
a final and permanent end</i>

01:14:27.055 --> 01:14:30.356
<i>to the Canine
Saturation-crisis.</i>

01:14:30.358 --> 01:14:34.292
<i>Every pet in the
Trash Island Camp will die.</i>

01:14:34.294 --> 01:14:35.696
<i>It may be too late, already;</i>

01:14:35.698 --> 01:14:37.297
<i>but, if the black owl
reaches you</i>

01:14:37.299 --> 01:14:38.901
<i>with this message in time:</i>

01:14:40.468 --> 01:14:43.971
Go to Megasaki City.
Find our masters.

01:14:43.973 --> 01:14:47.708
Appeal to the people.
Stop the mayor.

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.378
Save us.

01:14:55.049 --> 01:14:56.984
We're crossing
the river tonight.

01:14:56.986 --> 01:14:59.121
Begin preparations
immediately.

01:15:07.862 --> 01:15:10.128
You'll meet a bitch
named Nutmeg.

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:14.301
Tell her Chief says:
I'll see you in Megasaki.

01:16:44.692 --> 01:16:45.825
Hmm.

01:16:45.827 --> 01:16:48.493
Beautiful night.

01:16:48.495 --> 01:16:51.400
Peppermint's in labor.
Oh.

01:16:52.634 --> 01:16:55.101
Come sit beside me.

01:16:55.103 --> 01:16:58.770
It's okay.

01:16:58.772 --> 01:17:01.807
Master Atari, are you willing
to accept my brother Chief

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.342
as new bodyguard-dog
in personal service to you,

01:17:04.344 --> 01:17:06.682
former ward
to the mayoral-household?

01:17:27.103 --> 01:17:29.302
Chief, are you willing
to accept

01:17:29.304 --> 01:17:31.171
Atari as your direct master,

01:17:31.173 --> 01:17:33.873
to serve and protect
his safety and welfare

01:17:33.875 --> 01:17:36.712
with all courage, loyalty
and friendship?

01:17:41.116 --> 01:17:43.318
I can do that.

01:17:43.818 --> 01:17:45.353
Good.

01:18:50.317 --> 01:18:52.521
Chocolate milk, cold.

01:18:57.090 --> 01:19:00.194
Tracy Walker, Megasaki
Senior High, Daily-Manifesto.

01:19:00.196 --> 01:19:01.762
Are you Professor Watanabe's

01:19:01.764 --> 01:19:04.533
former Assistant-Scientist,
Yoko-ono-san?

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.883
Do I have it?

01:19:25.018 --> 01:19:27.223
Too late.

01:19:31.825 --> 01:19:33.726
Do I have it?

01:19:33.728 --> 01:19:35.127
Too late.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.601
Nobody care.

01:19:41.437 --> 01:19:43.469
Do I have it?
Do I have the story?

01:19:43.471 --> 01:19:45.171
Yes or no? On the record!

01:19:45.173 --> 01:19:46.672
I am sorry for your loss,

01:19:46.674 --> 01:19:49.342
but we both know:
that was no suicide!

01:19:49.344 --> 01:19:53.247
I need to prove
my conspiracy-theory!

01:19:53.249 --> 01:19:57.949
Ben is dead.
No future on Trash Island.

01:19:57.951 --> 01:19:59.954
I am failure.

01:20:02.524 --> 01:20:05.227
Pull yourself together
and act like a scientist!

01:20:09.496 --> 01:20:12.668
Professor Watanabe
never gave up.

01:20:24.245 --> 01:20:26.613
Is this... Is this the serum?

01:20:26.615 --> 01:20:29.382
The Dog-Flu cure?
The Snout-fever treatment?

01:20:29.384 --> 01:20:32.284
The end of the Canine
Saturation-crisis?

01:20:32.286 --> 01:20:34.489
Last dose.

01:20:37.858 --> 01:20:38.860
Tracy:

01:20:39.995 --> 01:20:41.330
be careful.

01:20:43.398 --> 01:20:45.864
<i>Part Four:
"Atari's Lantern."</i>

01:20:45.866 --> 01:20:47.065
<i>Not fair!</i>

01:20:47.067 --> 01:20:48.266
To dogs!

01:20:48.268 --> 01:20:50.469
- Not fair!
- To dogs!

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:53.342
- Not fair!
- To dogs!

01:21:01.516 --> 01:21:04.418
There will never be a place
for Dog-Flu in Megasaki City.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.717
There will never be room

01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:07.988
for Snout-fever
in Uni Prefecture.

01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:10.622
<i>The time has come to put
the violent, intimidating,</i>

01:21:10.624 --> 01:21:12.925
<i>unsanitary bad-dogs
of Trash Island</i>

01:21:12.927 --> 01:21:14.160
<i>humanely to sleep.</i>

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:17.896
<i>For their own good;
and also: ours.</i>

01:21:17.898 --> 01:21:21.303
<i>General Yamatachi?
Bring out the replacement-pet.</i>

01:21:26.107 --> 01:21:27.643
Sit-o!

01:21:30.311 --> 01:21:31.712
The results are in!

01:21:31.714 --> 01:21:35.113
Stand by for the incoming
Re-Election Night tally!

01:21:42.656 --> 01:21:44.357
<i>That crook!
He's stealing</i>

01:21:44.359 --> 01:21:46.728
<i>the re-election again!
Let's go!</i>

01:21:59.075 --> 01:22:01.774
<i>This landslide re-election
is a massive fraud,</i>

01:22:01.776 --> 01:22:04.346
<i>and we demand a re-count!</i>

01:22:09.751 --> 01:22:11.651
Respect-o.

01:22:11.653 --> 01:22:12.918
The mayor is allowing

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.122
the unauthorized
Pro-Dog student-protestors

01:22:15.124 --> 01:22:17.623
a platform to voice
their dissenting beliefs!

01:22:17.625 --> 01:22:19.591
<i>Mayor Kobayashi
has dog's-blood</i>

01:22:19.593 --> 01:22:21.763
<i>on his hands! You all do!</i>

01:22:22.596 --> 01:22:24.630
<i>Atari was a hero.</i>

01:22:24.632 --> 01:22:27.200
<i>Professor Watanabe
was murdered.</i>

01:22:27.202 --> 01:22:28.937
The serum works!

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:33.741
<i>The mayor is a crook,
and I hate him.</i>

01:22:38.947 --> 01:22:40.681
This small minority
of dog-lovers

01:22:40.683 --> 01:22:42.914
has been sent by overseas
special-interest groups

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.785
to agitate disorder
and incite anarchy.

01:22:45.787 --> 01:22:47.819
I hereby cancel and nullify

01:22:47.821 --> 01:22:49.288
Foreign-exchange
student Walker's

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:50.655
<i>senior high school study-visa.</i>

01:22:50.657 --> 01:22:53.091
<i>She will be expelled
from class,</i>

01:22:53.093 --> 01:22:54.926
<i>stripped of
her course-credits,</i>

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:56.563
<i>and formally deported
on the next direct-flight</i>

01:22:56.565 --> 01:22:58.134
<i>back to Cincinnati, Ohio.</i>
Oh. Hmm.

01:23:04.506 --> 01:23:06.572
Mayor Kobayashi
has directed Major-Domo

01:23:06.574 --> 01:23:08.643
to bring him the red button.

01:23:24.025 --> 01:23:25.827
Nutmeg!

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:22.814
Holy smokes!
My lungs feel clear.

01:24:22.816 --> 01:24:25.151
My equilibrium feels balanced.

01:24:25.153 --> 01:24:29.089
My vision is sharp as a tack
for the first time in months.

01:24:32.392 --> 01:24:36.127
Wow, that's a great serum!

01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:38.065
Master Atari, whose death,
I think we can say,

01:24:38.067 --> 01:24:41.033
appears to have been
inaccurately reported,

01:24:41.035 --> 01:24:42.802
has asked to read a statement
to the General Assembly.

01:24:42.804 --> 01:24:44.569
He will then withdraw
from the debate

01:24:44.571 --> 01:24:46.941
and respond
to no further questions.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.311
Dear Editor-Hiroshi

01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:55.714
of the Megasaki Senior High
Daily-Manifesto:

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.149
in a series
of first-rate articles

01:24:57.152 --> 01:25:01.186
by an attractive cub-reporter
on your staff,

01:25:01.188 --> 01:25:02.422
you shine a spot-light

01:25:02.425 --> 01:25:03.588
on the great injustice
that has occurred

01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:05.757
under the Kobayashi
Administration.

01:25:05.759 --> 01:25:07.760
I have spent much of my time
in recent weeks

01:25:07.762 --> 01:25:10.128
traveling in the company
of the very kind of animals

01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:12.530
our mayor refers to
as "bad-dogs."

01:25:12.533 --> 01:25:13.599
They are the finest
living-beings

01:25:13.601 --> 01:25:15.002
I have ever come to know

01:25:15.004 --> 01:25:16.668
in all my dozen years
on this earth.

01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:19.172
To your readers,
the good people of Megasaki,

01:25:19.174 --> 01:25:21.073
I say: the cycle of life

01:25:21.075 --> 01:25:23.009
always hangs
in a delicate balance.

01:25:23.011 --> 01:25:26.212
Who are we,
and who do we want to be?

01:25:26.214 --> 01:25:28.447
Who are we?

01:25:32.188 --> 01:25:34.587
I wrote a haiku
to try to express my feelings

01:25:34.589 --> 01:25:36.822
about the suffering dogs
of Trash Island.

01:25:36.825 --> 01:25:39.125
It is also about nature, love,

01:25:39.127 --> 01:25:42.029
friendship, eternity,
and a black owl.

01:25:42.031 --> 01:25:44.934
I call it: Atari's Lantern.

01:26:26.808 --> 01:26:28.874
He said a haiku.

01:26:28.876 --> 01:26:31.981
I'll tell you later.

01:26:34.013 --> 01:26:35.213
I dedicate this poem

01:26:35.215 --> 01:26:37.483
to my distant-uncle,
Mayor Kobayashi,

01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:40.619
who took me in
when I myself was a stray-dog

01:26:40.621 --> 01:26:42.355
with nowhere else to turn.

01:26:42.357 --> 01:26:44.390
Editor-Hiroshi,
please extend my subscription

01:26:44.392 --> 01:26:45.957
for an additional year.

01:26:45.959 --> 01:26:48.360
I enclose a check in the
amount of one thousand yen.

01:26:48.362 --> 01:26:50.662
Signed, Atari Kobayashi,

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:53.002
former ward
to the mayoral-household.

01:26:55.236 --> 01:26:56.972
Hmm.

01:27:11.719 --> 01:27:13.188
Not-fair-to-the-boy.

01:27:16.624 --> 01:27:18.194
Not-fair-to-the-dog.

01:27:20.662 --> 01:27:23.697
He says: "I-have-no-honor."

01:27:31.406 --> 01:27:32.675
Hmm?

01:27:42.549 --> 01:27:44.217
Holy Moses!

01:27:44.219 --> 01:27:45.551
The mayor
has just officially

01:27:45.553 --> 01:27:47.752
unstamped
the Trash Island Decree!

01:27:47.754 --> 01:27:49.922
No kidding!

01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:59.164
Major-Domo
is accusing the mayor

01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:00.765
of breaking
his campaign promise!

01:28:00.767 --> 01:28:02.466
He's steaming mad!

01:28:09.611 --> 01:28:11.414
It's gonna be a fight!

01:28:17.152 --> 01:28:19.451
Spit him with a tooth!
I can't get a clean shot.

01:28:19.453 --> 01:28:23.057
Too many innocent protesters.
I'll be right back.

01:29:20.682 --> 01:29:22.681
Escape!

01:29:22.683 --> 01:29:23.882
Escape! Escape!

01:29:23.884 --> 01:29:25.487
Escape!

01:29:58.186 --> 01:30:00.051
Well, the brain surgery
was a complete success.

01:30:00.053 --> 01:30:01.286
But his left kidney failed

01:30:01.288 --> 01:30:03.122
due to the stress
of the operation.

01:30:03.124 --> 01:30:04.555
But, what about
the right one?

01:30:04.557 --> 01:30:07.059
He lost it in a train-crash
three years ago.

01:30:10.165 --> 01:30:13.466
Take my left kidney...

01:30:13.468 --> 01:30:17.205
give it to Atari-kun.

01:31:03.816 --> 01:31:05.717
<i>According
to a long-standing statute</i>

01:31:05.719 --> 01:31:07.052
<i>unique to Uni Prefecture,</i>

01:31:07.054 --> 01:31:08.487
<i>in the event of the death,</i>

01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:09.654
<i>disappearance,
or felony-prosecution</i>

01:31:09.656 --> 01:31:11.023
<i>of the chosen candidate</i>

01:31:11.025 --> 01:31:12.457
<i>on, while, during,
or concurrent</i>

01:31:12.459 --> 01:31:13.860
<i>with the Re-Election-Night
ceremony,</i>

01:31:13.862 --> 01:31:15.328
<i>all powers and authorities</i>

01:31:15.330 --> 01:31:16.695
<i>vested in his or her
designated office</i>

01:31:16.697 --> 01:31:18.297
<i>transfer forthwith
to his or her</i>

01:31:18.299 --> 01:31:20.065
<i>next-of-kin and/or
appointed heir.</i>

01:31:20.067 --> 01:31:21.667
<i>In other words,</i>

01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:25.404
Atari Kobayashi is the new
mayor of Megasaki City!

01:31:25.406 --> 01:31:27.372
<i>You heard me right:
Atari Kobayashi</i>

01:31:27.374 --> 01:31:29.941
<i>is the new mayor
of Megasaki City!</i>

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:32.147
<i>Let's hope
that new kidney works.</i>

01:31:33.045 --> 01:31:35.916
Boy, what a night!

01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.386
<i>Life in Uni Prefecture</i>

01:31:41.388 --> 01:31:43.756
<i>returned to a comfortable
tranquility.</i>

01:31:43.758 --> 01:31:46.691
<i>The Megasaki Dragons
ended their winning streak</i>

01:31:46.693 --> 01:31:49.264
<i>with a staggering loss
to the Honda Goblins.</i>

01:31:50.565 --> 01:31:52.064
<i>Doggy-Chop re-opened</i>

01:31:52.066 --> 01:31:54.132
<i>all 11
of its domestic factories-</i>

01:31:54.134 --> 01:31:55.834
<i>and Puppy-Snaps
resumed production</i>

01:31:55.836 --> 01:31:57.605
<i>with an improved product.</i>

01:32:02.075 --> 01:32:03.676
<i>Graft and political corruption</i>

01:32:03.678 --> 01:32:07.048
<i>were reduced to sustainable,
acceptable levels.</i>

01:32:08.949 --> 01:32:10.482
<i>The Dog-Flu serum</i>

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:12.954
<i>cured every breathing-animal
in the region.</i>

01:32:17.759 --> 01:32:19.292
<i>Some say
a few lost-dogs</i>

01:32:19.294 --> 01:32:21.394
<i>continue to roam and scavenge</i>

01:32:21.396 --> 01:32:22.895
<i>on Trash Island.</i>

01:32:22.897 --> 01:32:27.235
<i>However, these
rumors remain unconfirmed.</i>

01:32:34.142 --> 01:32:35.507
<i>Mayor Atari,</i>

01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:37.209
<i>we all agree
it should be a crime</i>

01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:38.778
<i>to abuse, beat, murder</i>

01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:41.012
<i>or yell at any dog
in Megasaki City.</i>

01:32:41.014 --> 01:32:42.747
<i>That is not the question.</i>

01:32:42.749 --> 01:32:44.150
<i>The question is:</i>

01:32:44.152 --> 01:32:46.551
<i>what is the appropriate
punishment?</i>

01:32:46.553 --> 01:32:50.624
<i>Exactly. And the answer is:
Death Penalty.</i>

01:32:52.227 --> 01:32:54.859
<i>That seems excessive to us.</i>

01:32:54.862 --> 01:32:56.662
<i>Possibly. Anyway,
we should make it</i>

01:32:56.664 --> 01:32:58.498
<i>at least 30 days
community-service</i>

01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:01.265
<i>and a fine
of no less than 250,000 yen.</i>

01:33:01.267 --> 01:33:02.636
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

01:33:15.115 --> 01:33:18.018
I'm standing-by, Master Atari.

01:33:21.121 --> 01:33:23.488
So how does it feel
to be a former stray?

01:33:23.490 --> 01:33:26.225
Hmm. I take it
one day at a time.

01:33:26.227 --> 01:33:27.758
Last week, I nearly be-handed

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.061
an industrial lobbyist
from West Suzuki.

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:32.097
They had to give him
a blood transfusion.

01:33:32.099 --> 01:33:34.766
He probably had it coming.

01:33:34.768 --> 01:33:37.736
Maybe. Learned any new tricks?

01:33:37.738 --> 01:33:39.871
Actually, yes. Just one.

01:33:39.873 --> 01:33:41.709
Can I see it?

01:33:44.344 --> 01:33:45.609
I'm supposed to be juggling

01:33:45.611 --> 01:33:46.878
ten bowling-pins
engulfed in flames

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.145
over my tail at this point,

01:33:48.147 --> 01:33:50.582
but you just have to imagine
that part.

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.153
I can picture it.

01:33:54.155 --> 01:33:59.324
You still against bringing
puppies into this world?

01:33:59.326 --> 01:34:01.761
I'll tell you
when I get to know you better.

01:34:01.763 --> 01:34:03.729
Fair enough.

01:34:03.731 --> 01:34:06.465
My friends think
I like to fight,

01:34:06.468 --> 01:34:08.432
but it's just not true.

01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:11.037
Sometimes I lose my temper
and blow off a little steam,

01:34:11.039 --> 01:34:13.704
but I've never enjoyed it.

01:34:13.706 --> 01:34:15.709
I'm not a violent dog.

01:34:17.112 --> 01:34:19.280
I don't know why I bite.

01:34:20.682 --> 01:34:23.218
I'm not attracted
to tame animals.

01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:28.322
Thank you.
