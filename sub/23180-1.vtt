01:23.750 --> 01:25.286
It's called "Sun-In".

01:25.502 --> 01:27.288
You spray it on,
lay out in the sun,

01:27.504 --> 01:28.731
and it makes
your blonde come out.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.586
I heard
it makes your hair orange.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.837
No, not really.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.336
Maybe sometimes,
but not really.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.669
Forget "Sun-In",
I'm gonna use lemons.

01:36.972 --> 01:39.429
This is loads better
than some damn lemons!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.681
I paid good money for it!

01:48.150 --> 01:49.731
Who the hell are you?

02:03.874 --> 02:04.874
Mom?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.119
Mom?

02:09.086 --> 02:10.122
Mom.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.837
- Ow!
- Can I get a permanent?

02:14.551 --> 02:16.212
You mean a body wave?

02:16.762 --> 02:17.762
No.

02:17.888 --> 02:18.627
Why not?

02:18.722 --> 02:20.553
'Cause I bet
it's a big waste of money.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.264
And you're stuck
taking care of it every day.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.350
I went to a beauty salon once.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.063
The lady said,
"Jeanne, you want split ends?"

02:29.608 --> 02:31.064
That's because your hair's thin.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.276
Mine's thick.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.438
A permanent
makes you hair hold curls.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.235
- And you can feather it.
- Really?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.405
I don't know why you spend
so much time

02:38.533 --> 02:39.693
trying to be beautiful!

02:39.868 --> 02:41.074
Just be realistic.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.901
You'll probably
turn out just cute.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.491
What kind of mother says that?

02:45.582 --> 02:46.367
That's not normal.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.991
You want me to tell you the truth,
or you want me to lie?

02:49.127 --> 02:50.617
I didn't say you were ugly.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.077
I said you were cute.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.130
Cute is very high on the scale!

02:55.300 --> 02:56.506
Just cute?

02:56.927 --> 02:58.463
You're supposed to encourage me.

02:58.637 --> 03:01.925
You don't need encouragement
in the vanity area.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.846
Beauty is a lot of work!

03:04.017 --> 03:07.305
I was always just cute
and it worked out just fine for me.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.261
It's less pressure,

03:09.690 --> 03:11.226
and loads better!

03:48.895 --> 03:49.975
You like that picture?

03:50.355 --> 03:52.846
- You've got a great smile.
- Ah, thanks.

03:53.984 --> 03:54.984
Yeah...

03:55.152 --> 03:56.813
Not bad for your old dad.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.902
Hey, did you ever see this pen?

04:00.490 --> 04:02.902
It's got
Gerald Ford's signature on it.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.900
He gave it to me himself.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.656
I'm gonna hold on to this
until you turn 18.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.751
You know what's another
part of your inheritance?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.781
Something I picked up in Brazil.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.245
You know what
I do sometimes

04:13.336 --> 04:15.201
when I've got a little
extra pocket change?

04:15.297 --> 04:17.913
- Put it in the pig?
- Put it in the pig. Exactly.

04:18.175 --> 04:18.959
That way,

04:19.050 --> 04:21.462
when you go off to college,
you'll break it open...

04:21.595 --> 04:23.051
You get to keep all the money.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.141
Dad...

04:27.392 --> 04:28.472
Can I get a permanent?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.680
What?
Why do you want one of those?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.845
Because I'm ugly and
I feel bad about myself.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.767
- Come on.
- I have to be the new girl,

04:34.858 --> 04:36.814
and everyone else
looks like Farrah Fawcett.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.308
Farrah Fawcett?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.026
Who names
their daughter "Farrah"?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.424
Unless, of course,
you're Egyptian.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.860
Dad, haven't you heard
of "Charlie's Angels"?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.941
- They're on TV.
- No kidding, they're on TV.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.651
Yes, one is blonde,
one is brunette,

04:47.829 --> 04:48.693
they go on missions.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.371
What does that have to do with you?
And you're not ugly.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.657
You're a very attractive
young lady.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.075
Can I get one anyway?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.159
Please?

04:56.296 --> 04:58.127
- Don't you want me to be...?
- Eh!

04:58.215 --> 04:59.876
- Don't you want me...?
- Eh!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.008
- Gorgeous?
- Eh!

05:01.676 --> 05:03.041
You may or may not know,

05:03.136 --> 05:04.896
I'm very good friends
with Miss Dolly Parton.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.844
What people don't know
about Miss Dolly Parton

05:06.932 --> 05:08.797
is she's plagued
by combination skin.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.928
And Miss Dolly Parton also has

05:11.061 --> 05:13.473
what I like to call
the "sub T-zone ".

05:13.688 --> 05:14.973
And that's acne with pimples

05:15.065 --> 05:16.896
that occurs
in the bosom region.

05:17.108 --> 05:18.348
Is this a salon?

05:18.652 --> 05:19.652
It's the same thing.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.151
The whiteheads
and the blackheads

05:22.280 --> 05:23.690
are just running wild
up here

05:23.824 --> 05:25.234
in what we call "the T-zone."

05:25.700 --> 05:26.985
This is your T-zone right here.

05:27.285 --> 05:30.652
Wait, it says "Beauty School".
They're students!

05:30.789 --> 05:33.656
We can't waste $40
on some fancy place.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.581
We can't afford a beauty salon.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.117
We all have to tighten
our belts.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.793
Damn it, Jeanne,
why even bring it up?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.791
Jim! You said
you'd talk nice to me!

05:40.924 --> 05:42.630
- Keep your word!
- I am keeping my word!

05:42.759 --> 05:44.420
- Then don't say, "Damn it"!
- Okay.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.006
...and gently press
from either side like so,

05:47.097 --> 05:49.133
and you might even
prick it with a hot needle.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.661
Do you want to go home,
or do you want to get your hair done?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.496
If all you're gonna do is complain
then we can just forget about it.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.081
If you ask me
she doesn't need a permanent.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.391
She hasn't been
very good this week. She's sassed.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.515
- What?
- Come on, please.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.066
- Jeanne...
- Well?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.195
Okay.

06:03.613 --> 06:04.728
Come on.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.146
Just pull it,
pinch it, pop it,

06:06.283 --> 06:07.773
and let me show you why.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.566
Here you'll notice
that the whitehead

06:09.703 --> 06:11.159
is just filled with oozy puss.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.286
That oozy puss is...

06:12.330 --> 06:14.912
- Hey, Come on in.
- ...you just pull

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
and pop.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.953
Or squeeze and pop.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.166
But be sure...

06:19.296 --> 06:20.815
- What are looking to get done?
- A permanent.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.454
Have you done
one of those before?

06:22.549 --> 06:23.709
Lord, yes.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.290
Absolutely, yes, ma'am!

06:25.677 --> 06:28.043
I have done several perms
and they turned out just fine.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.086
That's great!
See, Aurelie?

06:30.307 --> 06:31.763
Are you a professional?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.969
Five more weeks.
Yes, I am.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.761
O-ray-lie?
That's your name?

06:38.148 --> 06:38.933
It's French.

06:39.149 --> 06:39.888
Really?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.306
So, do ya'll speak French?

06:41.568 --> 06:43.183
No, just English.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.477
Well, her name was
supposed to be Angie.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.687
Then, right when
I was about to have her,

06:47.782 --> 06:52.776
I ran into this French nurse.
She talked me into Aurelie...

06:53.622 --> 06:54.862
At the time,

06:55.040 --> 06:57.326
I liked that it wasn't
just the same old thing.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.413
Yeah, well,
that's real interesting.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.691
So, do ya'll want small ones?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.376
- Um...
- Small equals a tighter curl.

07:05.467 --> 07:09.380
I want ringlets, really soft
and natural looking.

07:09.638 --> 07:13.881
The kind I can blow dry
and brush through, to wings.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.215
Yeah, right!

07:15.310 --> 07:16.595
We wanna get our money's worth.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.768
We don't want to spend
20 whole dollars,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.062
and have it all
just fall out right away.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.693
Hmm.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.904
You need help
with anything, hon?

07:39.042 --> 07:40.042
Nope.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.662
Nope, I'm good.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.915
Just looking,
my wife likes these.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.712
Just checking out the styles?

07:47.092 --> 07:48.172
- Yeah.
- Sure.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.921
My name's Maylene.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.218
You just give a holler
if you need anything.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.595
How much you sell them for?

07:53.723 --> 07:54.723
Which one?

07:54.766 --> 07:55.766
Your cheapest model?

07:55.976 --> 07:58.763
That little blondie in the
corner's just 38 bucks.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.020
You wanna see it?

08:00.188 --> 08:01.598
You sell just the heads?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.058
The heads?

08:03.274 --> 08:06.641
You mean you just wanna
buy the form? The head part?

08:06.736 --> 08:08.416
The wig form,
I think it's called.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.856
That's what I'm saying. Right.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.356
Gosh, I don't know!

08:12.826 --> 08:14.407
Let me go and check.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.825
That's really not necessary...

08:16.204 --> 08:18.307
...that beauty is
on the inside, and I say that is

08:18.331 --> 08:20.037
a load of horseshit. However,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.332
what you put into your body
is just as important...

08:22.460 --> 08:23.666
I'm so sorry.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.957
That man over there
wants to buy a wig form.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.705
What's he want to buy
a wig form for?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.165
I don't know,
what should I do?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.006
Sell him the damn wig form,
Maylene.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.467
$6.99, that's a 100% mark-up.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.836
- $6.99.
- Give him a bag for it.

08:35.890 --> 08:36.890
Okay.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.445
...the T-zone is like

08:53.533 --> 08:55.194
the Bermuda Triangle
of skin care,

08:55.326 --> 08:56.736
good skin
just disappears up there

08:56.828 --> 08:58.443
to never be seen
or heard from again.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.008
Came out
good and curly, didn't it?

09:08.923 --> 09:10.754
What do you think, Aurelie?
Do you like it?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.082
Sure she does!

09:12.302 --> 09:14.509
Yep, in a few days,
it's gonna relax.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.212
Perm's gonna relax on you,
whether you want it to or not.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.180
I thought you wanted it curly.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.685
It's dramatic.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.895
Yeah, but...

09:23.021 --> 09:24.932
She's just startled
by the change.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.439
Sometimes it's a shock
when we make a big, bold move.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.879
- Hey, Barry!
- What?

09:29.903 --> 09:31.814
Come check out this permanent
I just done did.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.112
Study your final exam
material, I'll be right back.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.192
Ah, that looks good!

09:39.370 --> 09:40.370
That's good!

09:40.789 --> 09:42.120
That looks real, real good.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.573
- It does, doesn't it?
- You did a good job...

09:44.709 --> 09:45.994
Come here just one second...

09:46.169 --> 09:47.688
How long did you
leave that on her for?

09:47.712 --> 09:49.794
45, I think.
My doggone timer broke.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.400
Her hair looks like
it's having a stroke.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.960
Did it come out too strong?

09:53.051 --> 09:56.043
No, not at all. Heavens, no!
That looks real good.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.673
Besides, that's gonna relax.

09:57.806 --> 10:00.263
- Honey, it's good.
- What do you think, Jim?

10:00.600 --> 10:02.340
Don't you think it looks nice?

10:02.519 --> 10:03.884
Do you like it?

10:06.773 --> 10:10.607
Yes, I do.
It looks very attractive...

10:11.111 --> 10:13.944
And probably practical,
very easy to take care of.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.647
Know what, if you ask me,
she looks like a movie star!

10:17.992 --> 10:19.232
Wait, ah...

10:19.452 --> 10:20.452
Barbara...

10:20.578 --> 10:21.363
Treeland.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.694
You know? Streeland!

10:23.081 --> 10:24.867
- Streisand.
- Like Sonny and Cher.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.244
Or like Captain & Tennille.
Like a captain.

10:27.502 --> 10:30.209
When exactly
is it going to relax?

10:30.505 --> 10:32.962
This could be...

10:33.174 --> 10:34.209
soon.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.419
Real, real soon.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.008
Dad, why are you going so fast?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.382
You're young and healthy.
What's the problem?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.094
Why'd we have to park
so far away?

10:43.309 --> 10:45.391
I don't need to park
where everyone else parks.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.390
Exercise is good for you.
That was standard military pace.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.346
I'm not in the military!

10:50.525 --> 10:51.525
Why are you so uptight?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.437
I've already had
a hard enough day.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.481
I'm not uptight.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.982
And why have you had a hard day?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.730
I think people
are looking at me.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.983
People?
What people?

11:01.536 --> 11:02.901
Maybe they're jealous.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.532
Oh, hey, you see there?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.496
She wishes she had your hair.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.077
Did you see her eyes?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.955
You really thinks
she wants my hair?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.293
Definitely.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.001
Listen, they said
it was gonna relax. It just...

11:15.508 --> 11:19.421
Well, it hasn't relaxed yet,
hon. So, you can't judge.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.343
And I am also relaxed.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.138
Very, extremely relaxed.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.143
So...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.180
What's Reagan like?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.891
Oh, great sense of humor.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.101
Doesn't always
remember your name though.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.028
Um...

11:36.154 --> 11:37.154
And Nancy?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.238
Oh...

11:40.950 --> 11:42.281
No, she's fine.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.448
It was time to wrap up
that career and follow my dream.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.622
So, I am very grateful
for your financial assistance.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.208
Your scholarship
means a great deal to me.

11:52.629 --> 11:53.994
Now, I noticed here

11:54.214 --> 11:57.422
that it says I'm required to do
two quarters of "natation"?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.541
Um, that's swimming.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.011
Correct.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.013
Yeah.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.928
And what does that
have to do with pre-med?

12:05.141 --> 12:06.881
Oh, it's just
one of those old rules.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.096
We started as a religious college,
and...

12:10.063 --> 12:11.644
we're still
quite a bit Methodist.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.058
What about jogging?

12:13.316 --> 12:15.602
I'm much better at jogging
than I am at swimming.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.147
Well, a quarter of jogging
is also required.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.277
We are very strict about it.

12:20.531 --> 12:22.067
But have no fear,

12:22.283 --> 12:23.773
everyone can learn to float.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.153
After that, you just swim.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.159
Breast stroke,
back stroke, butterfly,

12:27.372 --> 12:28.987
and dive off the high board.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.329
Sure.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.078
I already know how to float.
I swim like a seal.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.875
Well, good.
So, then I don't think

12:34.963 --> 12:36.954
you have anything
to worry about...

12:40.718 --> 12:41.833
Dad!

12:44.555 --> 12:46.170
You're gonna swim, right?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.464
Is it your hair?

12:47.809 --> 12:49.549
Is it that you're afraid
it'll fall off?

12:49.644 --> 12:50.644
No.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.020
It's not.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.346
Well, I liked seeing you
on campus.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.482
You looked really smart.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.608
Really?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.562
Well, I guess that's better
than thinking,

12:58.653 --> 13:00.439
"My dad was too dumb
to get into college.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.486
He just sat around on
his ass, picking his nose,

13:02.573 --> 13:03.813
and was a total imbecile."

13:05.535 --> 13:07.196
We're both turning over
a new leaf.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.538
Dolphins communicate

13:12.667 --> 13:14.828
with members
of their family pod

13:15.003 --> 13:16.914
through a variety of
individualized

13:17.005 --> 13:18.586
whistles and clicks,

13:18.673 --> 13:20.914
using nasal air sacs located

13:21.009 --> 13:23.295
in the lower left
of the blowhole.

13:23.511 --> 13:27.299
Surprisingly, Dolphins breathe
through their blowhole,

13:27.515 --> 13:29.972
located at the top
of their head.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.392
I love dolphins so much.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.641
I don't feel like this
about any other animal.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.643
Except maybe gorillas.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.698
I don't know
why I feel so drawn to them.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.155
Hard to say.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.157
Oh...

13:57.587 --> 13:59.248
I'd love to touch one.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.589
I bet it's all
slick and slickery!

14:02.800 --> 14:04.165
I wonder if I'd be scared?

14:05.386 --> 14:06.967
Not if you practiced.

14:07.388 --> 14:09.504
How do I practice
touching a dolphin?

14:09.724 --> 14:11.180
You could use Jell-O.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.469
Stroke the Jell-O.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.766
- Well?
- You...

14:19.150 --> 14:21.186
Come on, I'm not
overly interested in dolphins,

14:21.277 --> 14:22.062
is that a crime?

14:22.153 --> 14:24.394
Aurelie, did you take
my butter dish?

14:24.739 --> 14:26.354
I'll bring it right back!

14:27.658 --> 14:30.274
- I want my dish back!
- I need it!

14:30.453 --> 14:32.068
Jim, do something!

14:32.455 --> 14:33.455
She took my butter dish!

14:33.664 --> 14:35.780
This is adding stress
to my evening.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.707
How would you feel
if she took your comb?

14:39.462 --> 14:40.793
Aurelie, open up!

14:45.551 --> 14:47.337
My butter dish
stays in the kitchen,

14:47.428 --> 14:48.964
so I can eat corn!

14:49.097 --> 14:50.507
We already ate corn!

14:51.849 --> 14:55.307
Hey, just don't take
your mother's butter, hon.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.768
We can buy you
your own butter, okay?

14:57.939 --> 14:59.291
Why did you put butter
in your hair?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.681
That beauty student needs
to go work in a damn kennel!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.850
She made me look
like a damn dog!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.977
And now I have to go
make friends like this!

15:06.114 --> 15:08.901
No cursing!
The lady said it's temporary.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.358
I told you.
"Damn it" is contagious.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.652
Putting Land O'Lakes in
your hair is not a good idea.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.112
It's not smart.
The stuff's going to curdle.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.952
- I can't even comb it!
- Okay, okay...

15:19.585 --> 15:22.748
All right, what are we gonna do?
Let's put our heads together.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.876
She's just nervous cause tomorrow's
her first day of school.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.536
We've got to get
a comb through it.

15:28.719 --> 15:29.719
We need a...

15:29.804 --> 15:30.884
What's it called?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.088
A pick!
A pick would be great!

15:33.182 --> 15:34.388
A pick would get through it.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.841
- A pick. You want a pick, hon?
- What's a pick?

15:36.936 --> 15:38.301
You're gonna love it!

15:49.449 --> 15:51.189
You're weird.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.988
You are so weird.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.497
Are you new?
What's wrong with your head?

16:01.002 --> 16:02.002
I got a permanent.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.293
You did it that way on purpose?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.000
Yeah, I like it.

16:07.258 --> 16:10.546
Plus, it's really easy
to take care of.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.878
And I like being over dramatic.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.013
Hey, hurry up!
Bus is leaving!

16:30.490 --> 16:32.230
Hey, that girl's got an afro!

16:33.868 --> 16:34.778
What you do?

16:34.869 --> 16:37.201
Stick your finger
in the light socket?

16:43.294 --> 16:44.909
Ronald McDonald head!

16:47.215 --> 16:49.422
- What's your name?
- Don't sit too close!

16:54.555 --> 16:57.171
She's part black!
Blacks sit together!

16:58.226 --> 17:00.512
- Hey, black dog!
- Who you calling black dog?

17:00.686 --> 17:03.428
Not you, Lydia. Her!
I was calling her a black dog!

17:04.773 --> 17:06.480
I just call her a giant.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.683
Her name's Lydia.
She's retarded.

17:08.903 --> 17:09.903
She flunks school!

17:10.070 --> 17:11.607
I don't even think
she takes a bath.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.313
I take a bath! I'll kick
your ass, stink cracker!

17:18.204 --> 17:19.614
Why do they hate us so much?

17:19.704 --> 17:22.320
What do you mean, "us"?
I'm gonna kill those honkies!

17:22.833 --> 17:25.199
They hate our hair,
right? Because it's different.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.375
I don't care about your hair,
you dumbass!

17:27.588 --> 17:29.249
Don't talk to me
about your stupid head

17:29.340 --> 17:30.830
that has nothing to do with me!

17:32.343 --> 17:33.708
If you want,
I'll be your friend.

17:33.803 --> 17:34.803
Hell, no!

17:34.845 --> 17:36.865
You didn't come over here
cause you wanted to sit by me.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.129
You're just desperate!

17:43.729 --> 17:46.220
- Let me see your bag.
- What are you doing?

17:46.315 --> 17:47.918
- Looky, looky.
- Give it back!

17:47.942 --> 17:50.308
Come and get it
you curly-haired dog!

17:53.239 --> 17:54.239
Aura...

17:54.407 --> 17:55.442
Aurel...

17:55.658 --> 17:56.693
Oral, Oral...

17:56.909 --> 17:58.740
Aurahlee Dixon?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.161
Oral sex?

18:00.329 --> 18:01.819
Excuse me, Ray!

18:02.081 --> 18:05.164
We do not say dirty expressions
in this classroom.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.770
Would you like it
if your parents heard

18:06.794 --> 18:08.000
what you just said?

18:08.629 --> 18:10.119
Now, how do you
pronounce your name?

18:10.298 --> 18:11.162
Aurelie.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.755
Auralie, Auralie...

18:12.967 --> 18:13.967
That was oral.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.250
Sexy dog dong.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.545
That's not funny, Kelly!

18:19.765 --> 18:22.222
It wasn't me.
I had something in my throat.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.804
Well, I hope you all notice
that you should be

18:24.895 --> 18:26.806
especially courteous to me
this year in class

18:26.897 --> 18:28.979
because I am pregnant.

18:29.567 --> 18:30.852
Very pregnant.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.817
And I am focused
on the pink and the blue,

18:33.904 --> 18:35.485
like those cute little booties.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.147
And I am in no mood
for sassers!

18:39.452 --> 18:40.892
Your family
just moved here, Aurelie?

18:41.037 --> 18:43.153
Yes, we used to live in
Washington, D.C.

18:43.331 --> 18:44.446
on an Air Force base.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.122
Really?
Your father a pilot?

18:47.668 --> 18:49.659
Sort of. He was called
a flight steward.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.290
Now he's going to college
to be a doctor!

18:52.381 --> 18:54.246
Probably a brain specialist.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.462
You don't say?
That is fascinating!

18:58.387 --> 18:59.387
Stop it!

18:59.513 --> 19:01.925
I'm watching you!
I don't like your attitude!

19:02.892 --> 19:04.428
Stop it with that gum chewing.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.593
I can hear you
from out in the hallway.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.638
My baby can hear you,
and it's driving my baby crazy.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.927
Well, she's off to school.

19:45.601 --> 19:46.681
Sink or swim.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.355
Hi.

19:51.982 --> 19:52.982
Hi there.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.394
What are you looking at?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.229
You. Only in a good way.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.611
You know, Jim...

20:02.785 --> 20:05.447
You might be over 40,
but you're still good-looking.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.532
Oh, really?
Thanks a bucket.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.615
It's true, a lot of men
go over the hill, but not you.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.375
Don't you wanna kiss me?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.338
Well...

20:15.464 --> 20:17.295
Hon, I'm just getting ready
to start my day.

20:18.259 --> 20:21.251
Let's not forget that
I'm taking college-level algebra

20:21.345 --> 20:22.905
when my last class
was high school math.

20:22.972 --> 20:24.803
Needless to say,
I've got some studying to do.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.093
Jim, I think you have
a low sex drive.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.765
No, I have excellent sex drive.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.208
Then there's
something wrong with me

20:33.232 --> 20:34.847
because you have
a low level of interest.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.141
Maybe your level is too high,
ever think of that?

20:37.403 --> 20:38.518
No!

20:38.863 --> 20:40.273
I'm normal!

20:40.531 --> 20:43.022
You're too uptight
to ever have any fun.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.527
I have fun!

20:44.785 --> 20:46.275
Lots and lots of fun events.

20:46.787 --> 20:47.993
Endless amounts.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.495
Maybe it's just that
you've got lousy timing...

20:50.583 --> 20:51.868
When you have nothing to do,

20:52.042 --> 20:54.374
and I have extra time
before work!

20:56.172 --> 20:57.662
Sex is free!

20:57.882 --> 21:00.123
Jeanne, I just put on
my hairpiece.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.166
The glue irritates my scalp,

21:02.303 --> 21:03.918
I don't wanna have
to take it off.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.093
Just lay down with it on!

21:05.181 --> 21:07.968
No, I'm not going to ruin it
because of your urges.

21:08.225 --> 21:10.136
This is
a very expensive hairpiece.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.011
Okay, and it's hot.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.225
So, my head is probably
too sweaty for the adhesive

21:15.316 --> 21:16.351
to work properly again.

21:17.318 --> 21:18.728
But fine.
You want me to do it?

21:18.903 --> 21:20.859
Okay, here we go.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.899
Come and get me.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.030
Now is your chance.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.688
You're not making this
appetizing.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.869
See? Even now,
all you do is complain.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.038
I am sitting down
in the appropriate position.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.786
The equipment is available.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.584
My treasures are on display,
as you can see.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.337
I'm not gonna just come up
and grab it and snatch it!

21:40.424 --> 21:41.755
I'm not a dog.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.666
You treat me
like a dirty old woman.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.547
You're calling
yourself that, not me...

21:45.638 --> 21:46.638
A pervert!

21:46.806 --> 21:50.970
When anyone else would think
I have normal, sexual desires!

21:53.604 --> 21:56.562
George Washington, John Adams,
Thomas Jefferson,

21:56.690 --> 21:59.727
James Madison, James Monroe,
and John Quincy Adams...

21:59.985 --> 22:01.985
I memorized them all one night
when it was raining.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.568
Well, good!

22:03.697 --> 22:05.312
That is real good.

22:07.910 --> 22:09.571
Now, who can tell me

22:09.662 --> 22:13.246
the three most important
systems of the human body?

22:13.999 --> 22:14.999
Aurelie.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.242
Um, skeletal, muscular
and circulatory.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.169
Well, that is right.
That is absolutely right,

22:21.298 --> 22:23.459
I can tell your daddy
is in medical school.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.341
And who knows what
the word "onomatopoeia" is?

22:26.554 --> 22:29.045
For example, the word "plop"?

22:29.932 --> 22:32.924
It looks like Aurelie
is the only one...

22:33.143 --> 22:34.143
Again.

22:40.901 --> 22:41.901
Shut up.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.525
Maybe I should go
to a different school.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.946
Everybody hates me.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.986
Sure, if you wanna be a quitter.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.069
In my opinion, you should be
proud of your intelligence!

22:54.081 --> 22:56.197
You try and please
all the dipshits of the world,

22:56.333 --> 22:59.075
you'll end up
on an escalator going down.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.624
Who knows, you might be
the first woman president.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.000
Those jackasses

23:04.216 --> 23:07.174
would be glad to have you
in the Back-of-the-Class Club.

23:07.678 --> 23:08.678
Dad, you're hilarious.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.922
"Back-of-the-Class" Club?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.962
There is
no Back-of-the-Class Club!

23:12.182 --> 23:14.298
I'm trying to talk to you
like an adult.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.518
Back-of-the-Class Club,
Smoking-Dope Club,

23:17.688 --> 23:19.394
Running-Around-No-Good Gang...

23:19.607 --> 23:20.767
It's all the same!

23:20.983 --> 23:23.941
Hey, you don't think
I'd rather be 18 or 19,

23:24.153 --> 23:26.144
and just starting college, huh?

23:26.447 --> 23:30.736
I had the intelligence,
but I did not have good advice.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.192
Is that why you became
a flight steward

23:33.370 --> 23:34.576
instead of a pilot?

23:35.372 --> 23:37.738
Who said I wanted
to be a pilot, huh?

23:37.958 --> 23:39.243
Pilots don't have it so good.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.200
They're stuck in the cockpit
the whole time.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.376
Who gets to talk
to the diplomats?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.212
Now, what do you think?

23:46.717 --> 23:48.548
- Think of what?
- My swimming.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.669
- Your head's above water.
- Lots of people swim like this.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.007
Bad swimmers, for example.

23:53.307 --> 23:54.638
Bad swimmers?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.808
Dad, you have to be a good
swimmer, this is college.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.017
You're gonna get an F.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.016
I know what I'm doing.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.805
It's called the breast stroke.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.140
Your head's still above water.

24:07.905 --> 24:11.739
My feet are killing me.
Who wants to give me a massage?

24:11.825 --> 24:12.825
How much will you pay?

24:12.910 --> 24:15.572
Do I ask you to pay me every time
I do something nice for you?

24:15.663 --> 24:16.493
How about nothing?

24:16.622 --> 24:17.933
When do you do
nice things for me?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.072
All the time.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.291
Food.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.120
Ah, great!

24:24.004 --> 24:25.244
You ever heard of this?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.150
"How to Make Friends
and Influence People."

24:27.174 --> 24:28.038
No.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.000
Very popular book.
Very successful.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.551
She's not gonna like
that book.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.638
Yes, she is!

24:33.722 --> 24:35.838
- It looks 100 years old.
- It's from the 1950s,

24:35.933 --> 24:38.015
and it's very popular
because it works.

24:38.268 --> 24:40.600
You read this, and those bullies
will leave you alone.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.298
It teaches you
how to flatter them.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.563
Flatter them?
You think that's gonna work?

24:44.650 --> 24:46.311
It's worked
for millions of other people.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.559
It worked for people
who are starving,

24:48.696 --> 24:50.937
people who have to sell
products on one leg.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.156
Why not you?

24:53.742 --> 24:55.607
- Is that our doorbell?
- Get that.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.319
- Why do I have to get it?
- I smell like chicken.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.494
And I'm tired.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.448
- I'm tired, too.
- I'll get it, I'll get it.

25:03.127 --> 25:03.991
Welcome!

25:04.086 --> 25:06.168
Dad, I think
it's the Welcome Wagon.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.335
Should I open?

25:08.590 --> 25:09.590
Nah.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.748
Who needs their coupons?

25:11.093 --> 25:13.175
What coupons?
They have a gift basket!

25:13.262 --> 25:14.752
I think I saw free jelly!

25:14.847 --> 25:16.587
You're so naive.

25:16.724 --> 25:18.204
There's no such thing
as "free jelly."

25:18.308 --> 25:19.423
I love coupons!

25:19.518 --> 25:21.850
What's wrong with us
that no one answers the door?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.269
I wanted to open the door.
But Dad's too weird.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.356
Oh, I'm the weird one?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.681
Maybe I'm the normal one,

25:26.775 --> 25:28.766
and they're strung-out
drug-pushers!

25:28.902 --> 25:30.797
- Ever think of that?
- You're a clown, Dad.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.937
Oh I'm the clown?
Look at you, clown.

25:33.115 --> 25:33.979
You're the clown,

25:34.074 --> 25:37.032
or are you trying
to mess with the best?

25:37.119 --> 25:39.485
Ooh, you trying to start a war
you might lose?

25:39.621 --> 25:41.612
- Ooohh...
- Ooohh...

25:41.749 --> 25:43.455
Look strong, look alive!

25:45.294 --> 25:46.294
No!

25:46.336 --> 25:48.327
All great warriors
use the element of surprise!

25:48.464 --> 25:50.705
Dad, I'm gonna get Alzheimer's!

25:50.799 --> 25:52.710
I like to wrestle, too...

25:52.801 --> 25:54.883
Oooh, pile-driver, hah-hah!

25:55.596 --> 25:57.257
What do you mean?
Do I talk Swahili?

25:57.347 --> 25:59.804
You have fun
with Aurelie, but not with me!

26:00.017 --> 26:02.884
You think it's easy for me
to work all day,

26:03.103 --> 26:05.640
sweating in that stinky
chicken factory,

26:05.814 --> 26:08.851
working at Captain Chicken,
while you go to college?

26:09.026 --> 26:11.062
You don't even ask me
how was my day!

26:11.153 --> 26:15.271
Okay, okay. How is that
big boil on your rear?

26:15.449 --> 26:18.065
On your hip? Did it ever
turn out to be infected?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.275
What? That's it!

26:26.502 --> 26:27.582
Get out!

26:35.886 --> 26:38.502
What? You said you thought
that thing might be a boil.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.049
And as you recall, I said,

26:40.182 --> 26:42.298
"Don't worry, it's probably
just a simple pimple."

26:42.434 --> 26:44.095
I'm concerned about you, hon.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.009
I had no idea if you'd popped
it or not...

26:46.105 --> 26:48.938
Jim! Do I make fun
of your physical defects?

26:49.024 --> 26:50.104
Physical defects?

26:50.192 --> 26:52.023
Like your toupee,
for example?

26:53.737 --> 26:54.737
What's going on?

26:54.822 --> 26:56.904
Nothing, I'm the
Elephant Man now I guess.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.192
That's right, nothing!

26:58.408 --> 27:00.820
I go to work and I come home
to a big nothing!

27:01.036 --> 27:02.776
Come inside,
we'll figure this out.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.866
It's not healthy
to sleep on the grass.

27:05.082 --> 27:06.082
Go to hell!

27:11.171 --> 27:14.834
Mom, would you like
an apricot orange cheese ball?

27:15.050 --> 27:16.540
No, thank you, Aurelie.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.138
How about I give you
a foot massage?

27:25.894 --> 27:26.929
Thank you.

27:46.123 --> 27:47.329
Are you God?

27:49.251 --> 27:50.251
No...

27:50.419 --> 27:51.704
I'm Jerry.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.395
Pubic hair!

28:12.983 --> 28:14.314
So, what did you do?

28:14.526 --> 28:16.062
If he tells me
he wants to get laid,

28:16.153 --> 28:17.939
I say put that pecker
back in that pocket

28:18.030 --> 28:19.770
for at least two weeks!

28:21.575 --> 28:22.610
Who's in here?

28:28.874 --> 28:30.660
I bet you don't even know
what that means.

28:30.751 --> 28:31.991
What? Virginity?

28:32.920 --> 28:34.410
Somebody should leave
this bathroom.

28:34.588 --> 28:35.919
It's a free country.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.333
Bullshit!

28:37.549 --> 28:41.007
Smells like stinky in here!
Somebody's stinky!

28:41.136 --> 28:43.001
It was like that
when I got in here.

28:43.847 --> 28:47.305
Hey, have you noticed
she has long legs like a model?

28:49.353 --> 28:50.513
It's a compliment.

28:50.854 --> 28:51.934
A what?

28:52.522 --> 28:55.013
How'd you get
the name Oral, anyway?

28:55.567 --> 28:58.980
Damn, was your momma on drugs
when she popped you out?

28:59.196 --> 29:00.196
Let me see,

29:00.322 --> 29:02.438
I'll name my baby Oral,

29:02.658 --> 29:04.194
Oral dirty licky lick!

29:04.368 --> 29:06.029
'Cause that's how
I got talked into

29:06.161 --> 29:08.243
having this damn baby anyway!

29:08.580 --> 29:10.100
What's wrong
with your hair, Butt Lick?

29:10.207 --> 29:11.413
She said she got a permanent.

29:11.625 --> 29:13.957
Yeah, I never seen
no permanent like that!

29:14.461 --> 29:15.701
Cut it out!

29:20.592 --> 29:21.707
Oh, my God!

29:21.885 --> 29:24.251
What in the name of Hades
is that thing?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.302
Haven't you ever heard
of a pick before?

29:26.473 --> 29:28.555
They're popular
all over the United States.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.009
They're for the blacks.
I think it's for pubic hairs!

29:32.229 --> 29:33.969
Maybe that's your new name!

29:34.064 --> 29:34.974
Pubic!

29:35.065 --> 29:37.556
I'm gonna kick your pubic ass
every time I see you!

29:37.693 --> 29:39.058
- Oral!
- Get away from me!

29:39.152 --> 29:41.518
Give me that hair spray?
Pubic needs some.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.111
Get off of me!

29:43.323 --> 29:45.279
Pubic hair!

29:47.619 --> 29:49.280
What am I supposed to do?

29:49.496 --> 29:50.576
Confront Jack?

29:50.664 --> 29:52.495
Or play the good wife
and pretend

29:52.582 --> 29:55.449
I never found
those porno magazines?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.208
Which ones?
And bless your heart.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.833
I don't know
how I'm ever gonna forget?

29:59.923 --> 30:01.163
I don't know how you could!

30:01.258 --> 30:03.294
Don't put me in the mood
to give birth either!

30:03.385 --> 30:05.751
- I wouldn't imagine...
- Mrs. Tripp?

30:05.846 --> 30:08.087
I was in the bathroom
and these girls beat me up.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.471
Honest? Who?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.430
I think
one of their names is Kelly.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.429
You had a disagreement
with Kelly?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.761
She is not being
a nice girl today!

30:15.939 --> 30:17.099
She really is not.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.646
And they pulled my hair,

30:18.734 --> 30:21.350
and they sprayed
hairspray in my face!

30:21.528 --> 30:22.608
That is not allowed!

30:22.821 --> 30:25.312
If that happens again,
you come and you tell me.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.033
Again?

30:28.035 --> 30:29.650
Lydia! Lydia!

30:29.786 --> 30:31.572
Am I seeing you throw pasta?

30:31.705 --> 30:33.570
Don't make me get up
out of my chair!

30:33.707 --> 30:34.867
Help me up out of this chair.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.036
Lydia! What are you doing?

30:37.961 --> 30:39.792
Pasta everywhere.
Stop it!

30:40.005 --> 30:41.961
Why are you not controlling
these students?

30:42.966 --> 30:44.297
She could slip and fall,

30:44.426 --> 30:47.509
and she is a pregnant woman.
This is not acceptable.

30:47.721 --> 30:49.461
Bad on you, everyone!

31:21.755 --> 31:23.916
I just don't think
you tried hard enough.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.711
Compliments and flattery
are a very effective,

31:26.968 --> 31:28.378
time-tested method.

31:29.429 --> 31:32.262
Okay, hold on a second here.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.764
- Have you ever found anything?
- Doesn't matter...

31:34.935 --> 31:36.015
It's relaxing.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.082
You just got to
give it a chance,

31:39.106 --> 31:40.767
kind of like you
and Dale Carnegie.

31:40.857 --> 31:44.020
Dad, you're not listening!
I need something else!

31:44.611 --> 31:45.611
Like what?

31:45.737 --> 31:46.737
Brass knuckles.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.773
Brass knuckles?
Isn't that a little bit extreme?

31:50.992 --> 31:52.232
Oh, look at this?

31:53.203 --> 31:54.443
Oh! Look at that!

31:55.705 --> 31:56.785
A glass bottle.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.907
Probably used to store medicine
over 100 years ago.

32:01.336 --> 32:02.701
My gift to you.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.288
I don't want a bottle.
I wanna protect myself.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.498
- Ma'am?
- Oh!

33:24.127 --> 33:25.583
Sorry...
I'm so sorry.

33:26.630 --> 33:27.710
Do you know what...?

33:27.797 --> 33:30.288
What are these sounds?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.707
Oh, that's whales.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.339
Is my sound system too loud?

33:35.555 --> 33:36.761
Oh, no!

33:37.182 --> 33:38.672
I love mammals.

33:38.892 --> 33:39.892
Sea mammals!

33:40.352 --> 33:42.308
That's my thing too.

33:43.813 --> 33:44.973
The mating call...

33:45.232 --> 33:46.893
It gets real intense.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.273
Right there.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.859
Real sexual, right?

33:55.283 --> 33:57.490
- Sexual?
- Don't you think?

33:58.620 --> 33:59.951
Oh, I don't know about that.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.911
That's not why
I'm attracted to...

34:02.666 --> 34:04.327
Mammals, sea mammals.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.995
Well, maybe it is.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.751
Sexual is everywhere.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.130
Did you ever think about

34:11.174 --> 34:12.880
how much fornicating
is going on...

34:13.510 --> 34:16.217
in that little patch of grass
you're standing on right now?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.300
- Grass?
- Uh-huh.

34:19.641 --> 34:23.007
Oh, you saw me sleeping
on the lawn the other night?

34:23.603 --> 34:25.092
I don't usually do that.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.772
I'm normal.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.476
Oh, that's okay.

34:28.817 --> 34:29.897
It's okay.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.313
You know, for a second,
I thought you were God.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.235
You kind of have that look.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.607
Are you an artist?

34:38.994 --> 34:40.574
I give art lessons.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.241
I have no talent.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.119
You don't need talent.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.456
You just need to feel it.

34:49.379 --> 34:50.379
Yearning.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.915
Yeah.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.462
That was good.
Good job!

35:00.682 --> 35:03.389
Now, the nabia, which is
right here below the nose,

35:03.602 --> 35:05.467
is the weakest bone
in the whole body.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.053
If you control
somebody's personal nabia,

35:08.398 --> 35:09.558
you control them.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.388
Volunteer?

35:10.525 --> 35:12.061
- Take me.
- Over here.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.350
Roger, come on up.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.617
Okay.

35:20.952 --> 35:21.952
Be a mugger.

35:26.416 --> 35:27.416
Good.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.667
You see that?

35:28.877 --> 35:31.584
I won that there fight
with this!

35:31.796 --> 35:32.956
Anybody can do it.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.122
I didn't know
there was a personal nabia.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.748
Hmm, me neither.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.459
Think of how that knowledge
could come in handy.

35:39.679 --> 35:40.885
Did you know that?

35:41.056 --> 35:42.056
No.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.592
Where are all the girls?

35:43.725 --> 35:44.725
Not here.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.219
They're not tough like you.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.060
Now, Roger, I'm gonna have you
mug somebody else.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.478
Oh, hi, Dixon family!

35:50.607 --> 35:51.687
How you guys doing?

35:52.442 --> 35:53.442
Good!

35:53.485 --> 35:55.692
You guys called earlier?
Little girl getting bullied?

35:55.904 --> 35:56.904
This one.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.113
That's her?

35:58.198 --> 36:00.359
Come on up, Aurala!
Why don't you give it a try!

36:00.492 --> 36:01.948
I'm just a visitor.

36:02.035 --> 36:04.117
There's no such thing as
visitors here in the dojo.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.994
Okay? Now you come on up,
and you push on Roger's nabia.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.827
- Go, go, go!
- Go on...

36:10.126 --> 36:11.126
Come on!

36:13.088 --> 36:14.624
Right. Stand right here.

36:14.964 --> 36:15.964
Hands up.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.456
Don't be afraid.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.047
Okay, Roger.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.381
Charge at her in slow motion.

36:22.597 --> 36:24.337
Get your finger up.
Yeah, good.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.052
Okay, here we go, ready?

36:26.851 --> 36:27.966
Go for his nabia!

36:42.617 --> 36:45.359
Way to go! Nice!
Get on back in there, Roger.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.116
He got snot all over my finger.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.738
Wipe it on your shorts.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.081
This place smells like feet.

36:57.674 --> 36:58.914
That's how men smell.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.965
Should we talk about
how women smell?

37:01.177 --> 37:02.713
It's not always potpourri.

37:03.596 --> 37:06.429
You know,
I think karate is great.

37:06.599 --> 37:08.305
You can take
the first week for free.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.925
Why quit before you start?

37:10.103 --> 37:11.388
Yeah, hon, where's your courage?

37:11.479 --> 37:13.119
I've got plenty of courage.
Where's yours?

37:13.148 --> 37:15.013
Me? Courage is my middle name.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.690
Oh wait, stop!

37:19.446 --> 37:21.311
Isn't that a real salon?

37:22.282 --> 37:23.442
Right back there?

37:25.535 --> 37:26.695
In this alley?

37:30.665 --> 37:31.665
Wow!

37:37.922 --> 37:40.254
"Permanent repair
and straightening"...

37:40.467 --> 37:41.502
$60?

37:41.718 --> 37:44.334
Ah, forget it!
It costs an arm and a leg!

37:44.721 --> 37:47.053
- Dad, can I borrow 60 bucks?
- Yeah, sure.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.472
As soon as you show me
where the money tree is.

37:50.185 --> 37:52.426
Well, I don't know
where the money tree is!

37:52.604 --> 37:53.468
Neither do we!

37:53.563 --> 37:55.929
- Let's look for it.
- I wonder where it could be.

37:57.484 --> 37:58.484
Oh, Aurelie...

37:58.568 --> 38:00.399
I'd even take a money shrub
at this point.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.813
Okay, everybody!

38:02.864 --> 38:05.355
Round one of Scooter board
hockey is about to begin!

38:05.575 --> 38:07.566
I want you to come up
and grab a bandana,

38:07.660 --> 38:09.776
and tie it around your head!

38:09.996 --> 38:12.032
Okay, if you were red last year,
grab a red.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.996
If you were blue,
keep grabbing blue.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.074
Boys, you up first, let's go.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.497
Settle down!
One at a time!

38:18.713 --> 38:20.544
One at a time, one at a time!

38:30.016 --> 38:32.297
If you're gonna sit by me,
you've got to give me a dollar.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.842
What? I can't!

38:33.937 --> 38:36.519
I've got to save up my money.
I need to raise 60 bucks.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.722
So? You're using me,
so I can use you.

38:42.111 --> 38:43.021
You think you'd sit here

38:43.112 --> 38:44.632
if kids thought
your hair looked white?

38:44.781 --> 38:45.781
Yes.

38:46.241 --> 38:47.822
You think my hair's pretty?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.326
Yes.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.203
You lie.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.452
Well, guess what?
It is pretty!

38:53.581 --> 38:55.341
Maybe just not on you,
ever think about that?

38:55.458 --> 38:58.370
By the way, that's not a afro,
you don't have a afro.

38:58.962 --> 39:02.170
I swear these dummies don't know
their ass from a hole in the ground!

39:06.052 --> 39:08.088
Why don't you take
your hair out of the braids?

39:08.304 --> 39:09.304
What?

39:09.889 --> 39:12.346
Because maybe
I don't want to, that's why.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.302
Hi, curly-haired dog!

39:15.019 --> 39:17.431
What be up,
Ronald McDonald head?

39:19.899 --> 39:22.044
That guy told me he wanted
to touch you with his finger.

39:22.068 --> 39:23.478
What? What finger?

39:23.570 --> 39:25.151
Why don't you grow some brains?

39:25.405 --> 39:28.397
Brett wants to stick his finger
in your poo-tang!

39:29.617 --> 39:32.108
- My tang?
- Down there, jackass!

39:33.079 --> 39:35.536
- But I don't even know him.
- That doesn't matter!

39:37.667 --> 39:39.645
I got a stomach ache.
I don't wanna play this game.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.660
Yes, you do!
This is our chance!

39:41.754 --> 39:44.416
We can finally beat
those girls asses!

39:47.719 --> 39:48.925
All right, let's go!

40:02.859 --> 40:04.099
All right, all right!

40:04.319 --> 40:05.684
Get your hands up!

40:07.030 --> 40:08.190
Over here!

40:09.699 --> 40:11.655
- Give me the ball, Oral!
- No!

40:11.910 --> 40:13.901
Aurelie, come on,
that's not our goal!

40:15.830 --> 40:17.683
- Let's go!
- That's not our goal!

40:17.707 --> 40:19.618
That's not our goal,
not our goal!

40:20.043 --> 40:21.829
Wrong way, Space case!

40:26.132 --> 40:28.123
Aurelie, don't give up!
Come on!

40:28.343 --> 40:29.503
I'm open!

40:32.889 --> 40:34.595
Come on! Come on!

40:38.353 --> 40:39.353
Come on!

40:42.357 --> 40:43.767
Give me the ball!

40:43.983 --> 40:44.983
Ow!

40:58.331 --> 41:00.663
Her!
She is so rude!

41:00.792 --> 41:02.783
My nose is about to bleed!

41:03.211 --> 41:04.997
She's dangerous!

41:06.798 --> 41:07.958
Out, now!

41:08.174 --> 41:09.835
You too.
Up, let's go!

41:12.428 --> 41:13.884
Keep your head high, Aurelie!

41:14.389 --> 41:15.595
You all right?

41:15.723 --> 41:17.588
She nearly hit me
with that there ball,

41:17.684 --> 41:19.015
could've hurt somebody.

41:19.852 --> 41:21.558
Park it right there
on that step.

41:23.356 --> 41:25.768
At this school,
we do not accept fighting.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.829
Fighters are sent
to the principal's office,

41:28.027 --> 41:29.688
and usually suspended.

41:30.154 --> 41:33.021
Fighting is low-class,
redneck behavior.

41:33.366 --> 41:35.027
Is it true
you started first, Aureola?

41:35.243 --> 41:36.243
What? No!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.613
That's right,
I didn't do anything to her!

41:38.830 --> 41:40.270
She stuck her damn finger
up my nose,

41:40.373 --> 41:42.204
trying to touch my boogers!

41:42.583 --> 41:44.244
You may try
that booger trick again.

41:44.419 --> 41:45.784
Go ahead and make my day!

41:46.462 --> 41:47.372
Girls!

41:47.463 --> 41:50.045
Have you not noticed
that I am pregnant?

41:50.508 --> 41:52.794
I am pregnant!
This is pregnant!

41:52.969 --> 41:54.630
And I do not have
time for this.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.969
You are disturbing
my unborn child.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.171
So, what I'm trying to say is

41:59.350 --> 42:01.386
that if you two do not learn
to get along,

42:01.477 --> 42:03.388
you are both headed
for suspension!

42:03.479 --> 42:05.561
Don't let yourself
overheat, Georgia.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.025
All right.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.937
You two girls need to give
the other person

42:11.154 --> 42:12.394
a good long look.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.819
Right now!

42:14.574 --> 42:17.065
How is this situation
your fault?

42:17.452 --> 42:19.989
What can you do to turn
this sinking ship around?

42:20.204 --> 42:22.365
I want to hear ideas
from the both of you!

42:22.874 --> 42:24.580
I try!
Oral's a bully!

42:24.834 --> 42:26.199
Well, that's it?

42:26.586 --> 42:29.874
That's it, I'm just gonna walk
on down to Mr. Toxin's office,

42:30.006 --> 42:32.292
and have him
process two suspensions.

42:32.467 --> 42:33.467
And guess what?

42:33.634 --> 42:35.374
It goes on your college record.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.470
Wait, what?

42:36.679 --> 42:37.509
Wait!

42:37.597 --> 42:39.258
I brought Kelly a present.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.055
I heard her birthday
was coming up.

42:41.893 --> 42:44.430
How'd you know?
It's in three months.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.680
Well, isn't that thoughtful.

42:45.813 --> 42:47.929
It's an antique.
It can be a knick-knack.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.274
A knick-knack?

42:50.818 --> 42:53.059
Thank you.
I don't have one of these.

42:53.446 --> 42:54.606
Well, now you do.

42:54.989 --> 42:56.274
I wish I did.

42:56.532 --> 42:57.772
Are you touched?

42:58.034 --> 42:59.365
You should be touched.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.992
- Why don't you two hug?
- Hug it out.

43:04.123 --> 43:05.909
Now we're cooking with gas!

43:13.466 --> 43:18.051
♪ I been on the high road
I been on the low road ♪

43:18.262 --> 43:22.722
♪ I been on the wrong path
more than I've cared for ♪

43:22.809 --> 43:25.095
♪ I've been on the wrong path ♪

43:28.981 --> 43:30.016
Okay.

43:30.775 --> 43:31.890
Here you are.

43:33.694 --> 43:34.900
Thank you.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.073
Okay.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.371
- Hi!
- Oh!

43:48.417 --> 43:51.079
Oh, I seem to jump
every time I see you.

43:51.295 --> 43:52.330
I'm unexpected.

43:52.505 --> 43:53.290
Yeah...

43:53.381 --> 43:55.713
I guess God is everywhere, huh?

43:55.800 --> 43:57.165
You know...

43:58.219 --> 44:00.926
I was writing a poem about that.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.713
God, I'm like a little orphan,

44:04.350 --> 44:06.966
fast asleep on the grass.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.933
I can't read any more.
It's embarrassing.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.697
You didn't happen
to think it was good, did you?

44:14.902 --> 44:15.687
What?

44:15.820 --> 44:16.900
My poem!

44:16.988 --> 44:18.148
Jeannie...

44:18.322 --> 44:19.903
Not everybody's a poet.

44:20.366 --> 44:21.902
You should try watercolors.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.774
And then graduate to oils.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.410
You don't have
original recipe here, do you?

44:26.831 --> 44:29.038
Oh, no, no, this isn't
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.865
This is different.

44:31.252 --> 44:33.584
Here it only comes fried.
Or under-fried.

44:33.754 --> 44:35.335
Some people want it more fried.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.501
This isn't the place for you.

44:37.925 --> 44:39.381
It has no imagination.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.131
Then why are you wasting
your time working here?

44:43.097 --> 44:44.257
Because...

44:45.808 --> 44:47.344
I'm the breadwinner.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.234
Get away from my family's yard!

45:11.167 --> 45:12.782
I heard your daddy wears a wig.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.200
What? No!

45:14.754 --> 45:16.585
I heard you've got a dirty mind.

45:16.756 --> 45:18.997
You told Lydia you wanted
to use your finger on me?

45:19.091 --> 45:20.931
You're gonna get finger action
sooner or later.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.052
I will not!

45:24.222 --> 45:26.008
If you knock off
the finger stuff,

45:26.224 --> 45:28.761
maybe we could play something,
like Olympics.

45:28.893 --> 45:30.633
What crazy-ass game is that?

45:31.103 --> 45:32.343
I wanna play masks.

45:32.563 --> 45:33.598
It's easy...

45:33.981 --> 45:37.098
We just have to put on masks
and talk dirty, sexy talk.

45:39.153 --> 45:41.360
If you do it,
I'll give you five whole bucks.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.275
Aurelie, come here, please!

45:45.660 --> 45:47.400
Faster, please, young lady.

45:50.331 --> 45:51.331
Who is that boy?

45:51.499 --> 45:53.459
Tell him to go home.
I don't like the look of him.

45:53.501 --> 45:54.866
Dad, I don't have any friends.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.438
It's not like I can
pick and choose.

45:56.462 --> 45:57.998
Your mom needs help
with the laundry.

45:58.089 --> 46:00.455
Why don't you go do it?
I've got homework.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.001
You see this?

46:02.426 --> 46:05.133
That's the tiniest record-player
in the world playing,

46:05.221 --> 46:06.882
"My Heart Bleeds for You".

46:09.350 --> 46:10.350
Get on.

46:11.143 --> 46:14.351
You know, we should use
this time to talk to each other.

46:14.480 --> 46:16.095
Get to know each other better.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.315
Okay.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.474
I've got to get Dad
to give me that 60 bucks.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.775
I've got to ask him when
he's in a really good mood.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.069
Aurelie, you don't get it.

46:24.365 --> 46:25.901
It's not gonna help,
we're poor.

46:26.242 --> 46:28.358
No, we're not.
We're upper middle class.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.151
Dad was an Air Force officer!

46:30.454 --> 46:31.454
He was enlisted.

46:31.747 --> 46:34.113
And his scholarship doesn't
kick in if he doesn't swim!

46:34.208 --> 46:36.699
So, don't tell me
we have all this extra money!

46:37.837 --> 46:39.418
Here, hang up these underwear.

46:41.674 --> 46:42.834
It's got holes!

46:43.801 --> 46:45.712
- You should throw these out!
- Aurelie!

46:45.845 --> 46:48.257
Underwear
does not grow on trees!

46:48.681 --> 46:51.593
Sure, I'd buy new underwear
if I could...

46:51.934 --> 46:53.014
But I can't.

46:53.185 --> 46:57.519
All over the world, there are
millions of working class poor.

46:57.732 --> 46:59.393
And that's what we are, poor!

46:59.525 --> 47:00.856
And I'm proud of it!

47:01.610 --> 47:03.942
Now, pick up
that poor woman's underwear!

47:04.030 --> 47:04.860
Pick them up.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.154
Why can't you pick up
your own horrible underwear?

47:07.616 --> 47:11.200
Jim, your daughter just said
that my underwear are horrible.

47:11.954 --> 47:14.036
That is not good
for my self-esteem!

47:14.373 --> 47:16.143
Since when is she my daughter
all of a sudden?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.998
Dad, Mom is a nightmare!

47:18.210 --> 47:20.417
A horrible,
low-class nightmare!

47:20.504 --> 47:22.210
Why can't you be loyal to me.

47:22.423 --> 47:24.288
She's gonna go off to college!

47:24.967 --> 47:27.299
I will be the one here
when you're old and feeble.

47:27.511 --> 47:30.298
I just wanna eat some meat.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.672
The meat is ready.

47:33.726 --> 47:35.591
Dinner is served.

47:37.355 --> 47:38.936
I was watching
World Wide Wrestling

47:39.231 --> 47:41.142
very peacefully just moments ago.

47:46.197 --> 47:47.232
Here.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.281
This dinner does not give me
a warm feeling.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.783
Do you think
it gives me a warm feeling?

48:00.920 --> 48:02.285
Jim, we need help.

48:02.505 --> 48:05.542
I saw an ad on the bulletin
board at work, it said,

48:05.716 --> 48:07.923
"Free therapy
for troubled families."

48:08.052 --> 48:09.292
From an ad on a board?

48:09.512 --> 48:11.093
We'll end up
with a serial killer.

48:11.305 --> 48:14.092
Jim, serial killers
don't live around here.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.511
Plus, it's free.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.344
Are you gonna pay me a dollar?

48:20.439 --> 48:22.159
I've got bigger fish
to fry, Lydia.

48:22.316 --> 48:23.931
I need 60 bucks
to fix my hair.

48:24.068 --> 48:26.275
You think my mama
would just hand me 60 bucks?

48:26.487 --> 48:29.274
Why don't you do some work?
Like collect aluminum cans!

48:29.365 --> 48:31.526
What?
Where would I get the cans?

48:31.617 --> 48:32.481
Use your head.

48:32.576 --> 48:34.696
Wherever people drink soda pop
and throw away the can.

48:35.496 --> 48:37.282
You mean I have to go dig
in the trash cans?

48:37.415 --> 48:39.701
- Have you ever done it?
- Hell no! I don't do cans.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.234
You're the one who needs some cash.

48:53.264 --> 48:54.549
Damn it, Lina...

48:54.765 --> 48:56.221
Could you chew
with your mouth shut?

48:56.434 --> 48:59.426
You look like a damn camel.
This is why we never go nowhere,

48:59.520 --> 49:01.351
'cause you don't know
how to act in public,

49:01.439 --> 49:02.724
you act like you never been

49:02.857 --> 49:04.722
out of a damn house before.

49:05.651 --> 49:07.171
That's why
I never take you anywhere...

49:07.361 --> 49:10.353
- There you are.
- Oh, the bathroom is no good.

49:11.240 --> 49:14.107
I'm gonna go set down my purse.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.653
Oh!

49:19.790 --> 49:21.630
Hello, are you here
for family therapy?

49:21.709 --> 49:23.199
I thought you were single.

49:23.502 --> 49:24.582
I am single.

49:24.795 --> 49:25.830
It's my group.

49:26.255 --> 49:28.746
- Excuse me?
- I'm the group leader.

49:29.633 --> 49:30.913
You mean, the therapist?

49:30.968 --> 49:31.968
Mm-hmm.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.925
Ya'll can come on down now.

49:40.436 --> 49:41.471
Aurelie, here.

49:45.483 --> 49:46.483
Welcome.

49:47.818 --> 49:48.818
So...

49:49.778 --> 49:54.488
What comes to mind when we think
of this funny word, "Family"?

49:55.534 --> 49:56.534
Anybody?

49:59.205 --> 50:00.285
Anybody?

50:03.209 --> 50:05.325
I think a family is like a car.

50:05.503 --> 50:07.664
- What model car?
- Any model.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.037
A Chevrolet, for example.

50:10.549 --> 50:13.291
You can wax it,
or you can let it stay dirty.

50:14.803 --> 50:17.795
To me, a family is like a plant.

50:18.182 --> 50:20.594
You give it water, and you hope
you didn't get a weed.

50:20.684 --> 50:22.174
Good. Very good.

50:22.269 --> 50:25.477
Now, who here is afraid
of their family?

50:26.398 --> 50:27.638
Don't be afraid.

50:28.108 --> 50:28.893
Anybody?

50:28.984 --> 50:30.940
I'm afraid
my wife's gonna get drunk

50:31.070 --> 50:33.277
and embarrass me
in public again.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.318
- If that's what you mean.
- That is.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.156
That's exactly what I mean.

50:38.244 --> 50:39.404
I'm afraid!

50:39.954 --> 50:42.286
We used to live
on a very nice Air Force base.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.329
Jim wore an attractive uniform.

50:44.458 --> 50:45.823
I used to shop
at the commissary,

50:45.918 --> 50:48.330
got 15% off of everything!

50:48.963 --> 50:50.169
Now we're broke!

50:50.422 --> 50:53.004
And he's terrified
to just go swimming!

50:53.133 --> 50:55.875
- You're exaggerating.
- Okay, he's scared.

50:56.178 --> 50:57.213
And his insecurities

50:57.304 --> 50:59.670
are going to get him
kicked out of college!

51:00.391 --> 51:01.597
Aurelie hates me!

51:01.892 --> 51:04.133
It's not my fault
that you have split ends!

51:04.270 --> 51:05.476
It's more than split ends!

51:05.688 --> 51:09.180
Is it true, Ariole, that you
blame your mother for your hair?

51:10.985 --> 51:13.567
Whose idea was it to go to
Barry's Beauty School?

51:13.779 --> 51:17.271
I want to share with you
a saying I came across recently.

51:18.951 --> 51:19.951
Quote...

51:20.035 --> 51:24.574
"No family is normal
like every other family."

51:28.502 --> 51:31.118
See there?
We're just like everybody else.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.170
Attention!

52:12.630 --> 52:14.712
This is your school librarian!

52:14.965 --> 52:17.923
Now, what I have here
in my hand is an announcement

52:18.010 --> 52:21.878
about a upcoming Halley's Comet
Poetry Reading Contest.

52:22.181 --> 52:23.181
I'll read it out...

52:24.475 --> 52:26.807
Calling all young people
with a poetic spirit!

52:27.269 --> 52:30.102
This contest
was initiated in our town

52:30.189 --> 52:31.224
ten years ago

52:31.315 --> 52:32.805
under Mrs. Florence Jacks,

52:32.900 --> 52:35.733
a local Mark Twain scholar
and aficionado.

52:36.236 --> 52:40.445
As in past years, the cash prize
will be 75 dollars.

52:40.616 --> 52:42.607
The same age
as Mark Twain when he died

52:42.701 --> 52:44.532
upon the passing
of Halley's Comet.

52:44.787 --> 52:46.743
All students eligible
to compete,

52:46.914 --> 52:49.951
and parents are encouraged
to attend.

52:51.126 --> 52:52.286
Thank you.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.872
This is the end
of the daily annou ncements!

52:55.589 --> 52:56.624
Did you all hear that?

52:57.299 --> 52:59.915
$75 for reading a poem?

53:00.094 --> 53:01.300
Like my husband would say,

53:01.428 --> 53:02.614
"It's better than
a poke in the eye."

53:02.638 --> 53:03.638
Am I right?

53:03.806 --> 53:06.764
I'm gonna put
a sign-up sheet later.

53:07.810 --> 53:08.925
Outside.

53:09.311 --> 53:10.767
But by a show of hands...

53:11.313 --> 53:14.020
Can you tell me in here,
who would be interested?

53:15.359 --> 53:16.359
Two?

53:16.694 --> 53:18.230
Two, three...?

53:18.737 --> 53:21.399
That's it, I am...
Put your hands down.

53:21.573 --> 53:23.109
75 dollars.

53:23.867 --> 53:25.152
For reading a poem?

53:26.412 --> 53:27.447
No.

53:31.542 --> 53:32.577
Kelly's gonna be in it.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.701
Her sister won last year,
now it's her turn.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.160
I thought it was a competition.

53:36.463 --> 53:38.249
It's competition,
but she's gonna win.

53:38.966 --> 53:40.957
If you want to be her friend,
don't sign up.

53:41.093 --> 53:42.093
I'm not her friend.

53:42.261 --> 53:44.377
You wanna lose your chance?
You could be one day.

53:44.596 --> 53:46.382
Okay, I won't do it.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.008
Aurelie.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.885
Do you wanna know
what's wrong with you?

53:53.856 --> 53:55.096
You're chicken-shit.

53:56.191 --> 53:57.601
75 dollars?

53:58.152 --> 53:59.152
So...

53:59.319 --> 54:00.354

55:26.865 --> 55:28.605
Are we gonna talk about sex?

55:28.951 --> 55:30.942
How do I know
you'll give me five bucks?

55:31.036 --> 55:32.151
I'm good for it.

55:33.539 --> 55:34.949
You know...

55:35.165 --> 55:37.121
if you lost your poodle head...

55:39.002 --> 55:40.833
I like you for your personality.

55:41.380 --> 55:42.380
Thanks.

55:44.091 --> 55:46.628
Okay, I'll kiss you
with the masks on.

55:47.219 --> 55:48.504
Okay.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.684
Wanna see my wiener?

55:57.813 --> 56:00.054
Absolutely not! Yuck!

56:00.357 --> 56:02.313
Why not?
He looks like E.T.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.224
Everybody loves E.T.

56:04.444 --> 56:05.604
E.T. is scary.

56:05.821 --> 56:07.686
No, he's not, E.T.'s friendly.

56:07.906 --> 56:10.238
He just wants to make friends
and phone calls.

56:10.492 --> 56:12.608
Do you always
call your wiener, "He"?

56:12.828 --> 56:14.034
A lot of guys do it.

56:14.246 --> 56:17.079
My brother calls
his "The Big Meatloaf."

56:17.291 --> 56:18.576
I don't believe you.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.710
Jeanne...

56:28.135 --> 56:30.672
Just follow through,
keep your eye on the birdie.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.637
- Ah!
- Hey!

56:34.975 --> 56:36.761
No slamming allowed!

56:36.894 --> 56:38.179
According to what rule book?

56:38.312 --> 56:40.849
According to the
"If You Want Me to Play" book.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.812
Jim,
did you ever think about using

56:42.941 --> 56:45.148
the step-by-step method
for swimming?

56:45.736 --> 56:48.694
This girl at my work,
her grandfather was in WW II.

56:48.780 --> 56:49.940
He had big problems back then

56:50.032 --> 56:51.843
because the Gazpacho
kept trying to kill him...

56:51.867 --> 56:52.982
Gestapo, not Gazpacho.

56:53.076 --> 56:55.192
- Stop correcting me!
- Gazpacho's a soup.

56:55.287 --> 56:57.152
A Spanish soup,
we had it on Air Force One.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.029
Anyway, try to follow me.

56:59.625 --> 57:00.740
It's delicious.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.207
The war taught him
how to fight back.

57:03.754 --> 57:04.914
Up here.

57:05.130 --> 57:07.371
When he was 104 years old,
the doctors told him

57:07.507 --> 57:08.917
he would never walk again.

57:09.009 --> 57:09.919
He went out,

57:10.010 --> 57:11.921
he got a little chair.

57:12.137 --> 57:15.846
He took one step,
he got tired, he rested.

57:16.016 --> 57:18.302
He took another step,
maybe two this time.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.509
He sat and rested.

57:21.438 --> 57:24.054
He walked great like that
until he was 108!

57:24.232 --> 57:26.063
And that's when he died.

57:26.360 --> 57:27.360
Poor him.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.059
I fail to see the point.

57:29.404 --> 57:30.735
Are you even listening?

57:31.156 --> 57:35.365
I'm trying to encourage to use
your will power!

57:35.744 --> 57:38.861
Maybe that story will inspire
you to conquer your fears!

57:40.207 --> 57:41.322
You know what?

57:41.750 --> 57:44.457
If I want Einstein,
I'll call him on the phone.

57:44.711 --> 57:46.076
Why is it a bad idea?

57:46.755 --> 57:47.619
Do it...

57:47.756 --> 57:49.417
step by step.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.757
I'll go to the pool with you!
I'll be your moral support!

57:52.886 --> 57:53.921
Absolutely not!

57:54.096 --> 57:56.382
I don't need anyone
to hold my hand!

58:00.227 --> 58:01.933
All right, that's good.

58:03.438 --> 58:04.848
Let's pick up the pace.

58:05.691 --> 58:07.602
All right. Good form. Good form.

58:08.860 --> 58:09.860
Okay.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.352
You wait and watch up there.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.979
You're gonna see a lot more
than just breast stroke.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.611
You want me to just sit
and watch your lesson?

58:16.702 --> 58:17.908
Yeah, why not?

58:18.120 --> 58:20.486
Haven't you ever heard
of moral support?

58:21.123 --> 58:22.613
You could be my number one fan.

58:22.916 --> 58:23.996
My mascot.

59:58.512 --> 59:59.672
Damn it!

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.254
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:08.722
Hey!

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.137
You can't beat on lockers!

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:12.894
It causes dents,
and dents look like crap!

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:28.201
The Equal Rights
Amendment died this year

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.707
has marked the end
of a 10-year battle...

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:33.626
- Did he take his hair off?
- Not that I saw.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:37.460
I can't figure out
why he didn't take me along.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:44.756
Aurelie, you never buy
lemonade at a restaurant, right?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:48.767
You just ask for extra lemon
wedges and sugar packets.

01:00:50.438 --> 01:00:52.895
I don't appreciate
you talking about me.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.310
I have excellent hearing.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:00:59.882
Am I the only one
in this house who knows

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.362
how to put away dishes?

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.565
Dad, why don't you be a lawyer?

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.068
Then you could go
to a different college,

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:07.910
and get your degree faster.

01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:08.998
Why?

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:10.529
Medicine doesn't take that long.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:12.206
What about residency?

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:13.454
Residency?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.702
Residency is a

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.626
four-year, post-graduate
program that is optional.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:20.457
It's mostly for foreigners.

01:01:20.635 --> 01:01:22.796
Last time I checked,
I speak English.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.091
I am not on the slow bus!

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.220
Oh, no. I benefit
from the American rules!

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.643
Jim, just because
you have a bad day,

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:35.184
don't take it out
on these beautiful cabinets!

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.356
I plan on stenciling them.

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:38.941
I'm not bothering
your stenciling.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.986
And don't blame it on my day.
I didn't have a bad day.

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:44.322
Yes, you did!
I was there, remember?

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:46.534
When we left the pool,
you were in a horrible mood!

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:47.525
You, enough!

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:48.656
Enough!

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.412
I am a child,
and you are the adult.

01:01:53.168 --> 01:01:54.578
I am the adult!

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:55.617
I am the adult,

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.607
and you are the child,
so, just shut the hell up!

01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.292
See, Aurelie?
He can't control himself!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.122
You are a donkey's ass!

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.671
And I'm not putting up
with it anymore!

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:08.217
You're always finding a reason
to quit because you...

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.803
You don't have the mind of a winner!

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:12.801
Or the hair of a winner!

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:14.188
What?

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:15.512
I am too a winner!

01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:17.097
I'm a winner!

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.104
You and the Methodists
can kiss my rosy red!

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.403
Hey!

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.900
We wasted 20 years of our life,

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.988
and he never even
got a promotion!

01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:28.904
All you can do is...

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:31.027
slam cabinets!

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.826
If you don't wanna love me,
I'll find another man who will!

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:34.997
Hah, hah!

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:38.414
And I get free art classes!

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:41.022
I wanna be an artist!

01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:42.456
I wanna be an artist!

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.249
- I wanna be an artist!
- Yes, yes!

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:47.882
- I wanna be an artist.
- Yes, yes...

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:52.632
- Stop!
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:53.811
You are!

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.223
Mom, wait,
what are you doing? Mom!

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:57.564
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.397
Okay, you're free! You're free!

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.016
Free!

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.067
- Wonderful!
- Art, art!

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.524
It's my pig!

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.277
I don't care
if my dad gets mad!

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:16.709
How much is it?

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.079
Looks about 10 bucks.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:20.414
Maybe 12.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.496
Twelve bucks?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:27.209
My dad put twelve bucks
in the pig for my college fund?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.387
Hey, wait!

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.505
Come on! Wait up!

01:03:31.725 --> 01:03:34.341
I got your twelve bucks,
it's better than nothing!

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.601
Hey!

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:39.562
At least he don't beat you
with a bat.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.268
You should see my daddy.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.733
Your dad beats you with a bat?

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:45.477
He does my brother.

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.030
Sure, when he's got a few
Buds in him, he's a maniac!

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:51.368
Oh, no.

01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:53.284
Is that Kelly Keester?

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:54.788
Oh, crap!

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:57.239
Hey baby, what's up?

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.499
Are you cheating on me
with that stupid,

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:01.042
pubic-hair turd face?

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.707
Huh?

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.795
That's nuckin' futs!
I don't even know her.

01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:06.610
I've never even
talked to that girl before!

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:07.999
You're a damn liar!

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.126
Shouldn't you calm Chunky down?

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.462
He's feeling my feelings!
You said you loved me!

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:13.964
I do, baby...

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:18.014
Kelly, I'm so sorry, I had
no idea he was your boyfriend.

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:21.437
I had no idea.
I'm gonna go home now, okay?

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.014
Bye!

01:04:57.602 --> 01:05:00.560
- How do you feel?
- I tried to open my blowhole.

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:03.392
I think you may have succeeded!

01:05:06.027 --> 01:05:09.736
Oh, you have no idea
how happy I am!

01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.106
- How much this means to me.
- Really?

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:13.656
You make me feel
like a teenager!

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:14.743
Me too!

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.277
I think you should just
move in over here.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.538
You're lonely.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.581
I'm lonely, too.

01:05:23.086 --> 01:05:25.247
Why do you think I do family
therapy?

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.665
Maybe you're right.

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:30.336
I never really thought of myself
as a radical woman...

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.427
Yes!

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.677
You have a definite radical
aspect to your personality.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:36.006
- That's for sure.
- Thank you!

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:37.680
And very nice breasts!

01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:40.509
Excuse me?

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.473
I...

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:49.647
If you'd like, I could just
say that to myself silently.

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:51.694
I think that might be best.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.656
I have a present for you.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.994
These are real
sperm whale teeth.

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:07.494
Oh, he has a cavity!

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:10.651
I'm gonna make earrings
out of them.

01:06:10.675 --> 01:06:11.755
That's great.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.466
Did you ask Mom
to come back yet?

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:14.678
Hell, no.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.089
Why not?

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:18.720
She should know
how to do the right thing.

01:06:20.852 --> 01:06:22.763
You know what
your mother's problem is?

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:26.020
She doesn't know jack-all
about how the world works.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.060
You wanna
know how things go down?

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:30.569
I'll tell you.

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:33.069
We were flying back
from the ranch in California...

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:37.156
Reagan asks for a steak.
Medium rare.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:39.864
So, I go to the back,
I look in the freezer.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:42.950
No steaks.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.997
What I thought was a steak...

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:47.374
was a pork chop.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.960
Somebody screwed up, not me.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:53.088
It's not my job
to stock the freezer.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.629
But it's my job...

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.052
to double-check.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.597
People say there's
no such thing as bad luck.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.516
It's not true.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.933
Snap your fingers,
and you're screwed.

01:07:09.817 --> 01:07:10.602
Yeah, but...

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.396
I wish you'd ask her
to come back.

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.650
We're a family.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.195
- Don't just give up.
- Aren't you giving up?

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.862
Should I go back
to karate class?

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:22.152
I think adolescence
is like an old western.

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.453
Sometimes you realize
you're surrounded...

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.081
and you just got to
shoot your way out.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.081
I thought
you were scared of Kelly.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.208
I am,
but I'm doing it anyway.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:38.843
- What about you?
- Nope.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:42.135
Black kids don't win contests.
Not when the judges are white.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:45.759
Well, you wanna come
watch me compete?

01:07:45.979 --> 01:07:47.935
- It's Monday, 5th period.
- Can't.

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:49.953
That's when they stick me
with the retards.

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.306
But you're not retarded.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.240
Jeanne...

01:08:06.666 --> 01:08:08.657
You want chicken?
Take it "to go."

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.328
I'm sorry.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:12.998
You're sorry?

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.375
Don't move in
with that guy next door.

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.675
I have my flaws,
but I am a real man.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:22.344
You can't resent me
'cause I don't like whale calls.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:24.764
I highly respect
your love of whales...

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.841
and dolphins and gorillas.

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.388
It's not the whales.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.269
He's an artist.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:32.270
Maybe I'm an artist.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.935
But I'm the one who loves you.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.602
Doesn't feel like you love me.

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.321
All I feel is like I'm ignored.

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:45.234
Listen, I've been thinking...

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.242
Aurelie's going back to karate.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.622
What if it something that
we all did together?

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.535
You know, a together thing.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.831
You think karate
is a together thing?

01:08:58.259 --> 01:08:59.795
I absolutely do.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:02.794
Great block!

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.841
Great form!

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.010
Come on,
it's not that great.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:08.765
Yes, it's beautiful.

01:09:08.935 --> 01:09:10.721
You're laying it on
a little thick.

01:09:11.397 --> 01:09:13.729
You said you didn't feel loved,
and I want you to feel

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.022
like I love you.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:20.273
I'll do whatever you want.
You name it.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.229
I want to go back to therapy!

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.837
Thank you for meeting us
on short notice.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:41.051
That's fine.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.384
I often invite
troubled individuals

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.712
to come to
these impromptu sessions.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.755
Hey, who you calling
"troubled", man?

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.886
Jim! We're here for help!

01:09:49.977 --> 01:09:51.933
This is a couples
counseling session!

01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.303
It is?

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.731
I'm here to talk about
Ty-ty's pill-popping.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.479
That's fine, too.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:04.235
And in these smaller groups,
I like to create a space.

01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:06.824
A space to have sex
with my wife?

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:09.152
Jim, you're starting
to make me angry!

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:10.953
You're not even trying!

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:12.872
Fine. Fine.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.625
Ty-ty is mean when he's high!

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.877
I just had to get that
off my chest.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:19.965
Good, good.

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:22.415
And since this is
a space where people

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.500
say what they need to say
to each other,

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.007
and you seem to be
pretty agitated, Jeannie...

01:10:27.432 --> 01:10:28.922
Maybe you should
get the ball rolling.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:30.016
Okay.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.554
Jerry, you're very nice.

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:36.145
And I love that
you see me as an artist.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:41.309
But when you suddenly
start talking about...

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.610
somebody's breasts...

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:48.984
they might start thinking
you're a dirty old man.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.327
Jeannie,
I'm your therapist here.

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.659
We can discuss this in private.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.835
I don't care
to be together privately.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.162
And Jim...

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.794
What I want to say to you is...

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.546
I'm a free spirit.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:08.128
My spirit wants to be free,

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.632
and creative!

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.178
Jim, if you want
to stay married to me...

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:15.475
you need to see me as I am.

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:17.520
I'm a little bit...

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:21.941
outside of everything.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:25.441
I don't want to be
outside with you too.

01:11:25.698 --> 01:11:28.235
I wanted you to be
interested in me!

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:30.946
Genuinely interested.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.327
But you never were.

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:36.034
Jeanne...

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:38.032
If you were a magazine...

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.451
I would buy a subscription.

01:11:41.672 --> 01:11:42.832
What does that mean?

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:45.290
It means that I did not
always buy a subscription

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.212
in the past, Jerry.

01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.504
I would go to the newsstand.

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:52.346
Sometimes I would buy an issue.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:54.765
But sometimes...

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.388
I would not.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:12:00.059
And by God,
I wanna be a subscriber!

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:06.068
I almost lost
this wonderful magazine

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:08.984
and I realize now...

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:11.532
that I love it!

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.702
And I wanna read
every article, Jerry!

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.205
Every article!

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:20.954
Cover to cover!

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:29.300
Think about the bullies!
Think about them!

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.293
Isn't it a little early
for her to spar?

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:33.721
No, you're supposed to do that,
even on the first day.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.764
Does that mean
you and me could do it?

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.685
If you wanted to.
Absolutely, we could.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.353
Cat stance!
Don't forget your cat stance.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.482
Cat stance!

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:44.561
All right, Orala, here we go.

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:46.797
Show him it's not just
a little girl he's messing with.

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:47.981
Okay, go in there and kick.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:49.562
- Good!
- Nice!

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:51.189
Oh, good kick, yeah!

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:53.278
Block it, block it!

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:55.158
That's it.
Kick, Orala, kick!

01:12:57.290 --> 01:12:58.575
Match goes to Sam.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.574
Orala, next time
you just got to kick more!

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:04.038
You don't show what
you're made of, you know?

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.162
- Mm-Hmm.
- Are you feeling ok?

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:08.126
You just got to kick
a little more, okay?

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.582
Kick like a cat!

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:12.843
Are all of you here?

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:15.216
And did you all get your numbers
from your home room?

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:16.218
Here, let's see one.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:18.550
Six, five, eight, nine, ten...

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.138
Where's 14?

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.432
I thought I had 14 kids,
where's Lydia Johnson?

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:23.603
She's coming.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:24.848
Oh, good, good...

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.483
Now, that is the order
in which we'll be calling you.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.144
So, when it's your turn,
I will find you here,

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:32.689
and then I'm gonna
lead you to the "go" position,

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.983
where you all need
to listen carefully...

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.360
for your chime, all right?

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.780
Also, I want to point out to you
that our judge and patron,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.456
Mrs. Florence Jacks,

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.125
she's sitting right out there
in the very front row!

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:48.003
So, smile big and do
your very best, all right?

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.960
Isn't that wonderful!

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:54.260
Do you remember
what the SH sound is?

01:13:54.555 --> 01:13:56.045
What sound does that make?

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.757
Sh...

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:00.133
Shit.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:03.060
Let's not curse.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:05.398
Okay.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.233
Remember like
when we want to be quiet?

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:13.988
What nice words start with SH?

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:18.284
Sh...

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:19.746
Shit!

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:24.282
You don't want to be
held back again, do you?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:28.919
What sound does a teapot make?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:32.669
Excuse me?

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.589
Lydia Johnson is needed
in the principal's office.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:36.721
For what?

01:14:37.056 --> 01:14:38.592
You're in trouble, I guess.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.472
- Who wrote this?
- Beats me.

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:43.263
I'm supposed to take Lydia
to the principal's office.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:48.138
What the hell? What did I do?

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.602
Nothing.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:51.437
Here, I brought you a folder.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:54.149
It's for the poetry competition.
I signed you up.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:55.949
What?

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:57.075
Well, unsign me up!

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.762
I'm not doing
that damn poetry competition!

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:01.448
Look, all you have to do
is read the poem!

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:03.578
Don't you wanna do that
instead of going back

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.073
to the retard class?

01:15:05.292 --> 01:15:06.292
Maybe you'll win!

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.961
You think I could win?

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:13.046
How am I gonna win?

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:14.965
Just read the poem.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:16.883
You might be really good at it.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.841
Come on,
we have no time.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.800
Come on.

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:26.310
How'd you choose this poem?

01:15:26.522 --> 01:15:28.729
"I am a woman,
sick for passion."

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.435
You think I'm gonna read this?

01:15:30.735 --> 01:15:32.726
Yes, my lady. No, my lady...

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:33.942
This is ridiculous!

01:15:34.155 --> 01:15:35.395
I thought it was romantic.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:36.938
Where's one and two?

01:15:37.074 --> 01:15:39.611
Oh, Kelly, you're gonna be
number one, all right?

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.326
Now, in exactly five minutes,
we are gonna start!

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:45.367
So, anybody has to pee,
you better do it now!

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:47.289
I didn't have to pee
until she said that.

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:48.658
You're nervous, just hold it!

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:50.284
I can't! Here...

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:52.244
Take my bag
and my folder.

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.414
And I'll be back.

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.648
We done told you not to enter
this poetry competition!

01:16:13.819 --> 01:16:14.979
You're not the boss of me.

01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:17.153
Oh, yeah? Come on out,
and we'll see who's boss.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:20.902
Come on, Kelly!

01:16:23.662 --> 01:16:26.119
I just wanna say,
I love Mark Twain!

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.410
He's my favorite famous person.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.916
I think he was such a genius.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:32.789
So, I chose a poem by him...

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:34.624
Isn't that the bully girl?

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.091
I think so.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:38.587
...did young Stephen sicken,
and did young Stephen die?

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:41.635
And did the sad hearts thicken,
and did the mourners cry?

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:44.384
- Isn't she doing good?
- She is doing so good.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.840
She's precious...

01:16:45.976 --> 01:16:49.184
...impaired the sacred name
Of Stephen Dowling Botes...

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.431
Bots.

01:16:52.733 --> 01:16:53.733
Thank you.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.772
Come on, Oral,
you chicken or something?

01:16:57.988 --> 01:16:58.773
Mary John!

01:16:58.989 --> 01:16:59.989
Excuse me!

01:17:00.074 --> 01:17:01.484
Why are you not
at the assembly?

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.573
I was using the bathroom.

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:05.279
I'm on my way, Mrs. Tripp!

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:08.112
Hey, Mary John,
did you forget your brush?

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:09.367
Get to the assembly!

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.823
Mary John, you stay right here,

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.996
I need to talk to you
about your mathematics grade.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:15.453
I thought you knew your math
better than that.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.206
Have you been working
with your tutor?

01:17:19.677 --> 01:17:21.404
Your mother told me
you were working with the tutor,

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:22.508
Mary John!

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:32.056
If I run real fast,
I probably can make it.

01:17:32.273 --> 01:17:34.184
Go ahead and try, Oral.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:36.474
Do you want
to fight me instead?

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:38.855
- You wanna fight me?
- No.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.361
But I'm not gonna run anymore.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:43.485
You wanna fight, go ahead.

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.529
"Stopping by Woods
on a Snowy Evening"

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:51.405
by Robert Frost

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:54.576
Whose woods these are
I think I know

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.086
His house is in
the village though...

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:58.666
He will not see me...

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:00.437
You're lucky
I don't wanna mess my hair up.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.716
Or I'd beat you up
some more right now.

01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:05.305
Wait!

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.600
What the hell
is that crazy thing?

01:18:13.147 --> 01:18:14.262
I dare you.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:17.227
He gives
his harness bells a shake

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:18.933
To ask if there...

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.311
I bet Aurelie
can beat these girls.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.654
I can't believe it.
You never hold my hand.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:26.399
That was the old me.

01:18:26.619 --> 01:18:27.904
This is the new.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.496
"Casey at the Bat"
by Ernest L. Thayer.

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:40.417
The outlook wasn't brilliant
for the Mudville nine that day,

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.339
The score stood four to two,

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.166
but with one inning
more to play.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:46.009
And then when Cooney
died at first,

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.632
and Barrows did the same...

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:49.262
Where's 13 and 14?

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.215
13 and 14, we're ready for you!

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.891
Where...?
Where's Orila?

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.122
I think she went
to the bathroom,

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.226
I'll just go get her...

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:56.956
No, Greta,
we have an audience out there,

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:58.188
somebody has to go on!

01:18:58.317 --> 01:18:59.227
But I'm scared!

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:01.900
You'll be okay, Lydia.
You're gonna be lucky number 13!

01:19:02.112 --> 01:19:02.942
Lucky number!

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:04.903
I'm gonna go
raise the mike for you.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.446
Come on, Lydia, you can do this.

01:19:06.659 --> 01:19:08.365
Just show Mrs. Jacks
what you got.

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:10.617
It's almost over,
where's Aurelie?

01:19:51.453 --> 01:19:52.453
Birds...

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.330
flying high...

01:20:03.674 --> 01:20:06.040
You know how I feel...

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:10.469
Sun...

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.088
in the sky...

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:19.178
You know how I feel...

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:24.771
It's a new dawn...

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.062
It is a new day...

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.028
It's a new life for me...

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.365
Fish...

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.038
in the sea...

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.750
You know how I feel...

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:45.538
Rivers running free...

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.624
You know how I feel...

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.343
Blossoms...

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:54.262
on the trees...

01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.599
You know how I feel...

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:01.644
It's a new dawn.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.893
It's a new day.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.437
It's a new life for me.

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.272
And I'm feeling good.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.616
And this old world

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.699
is a new world,

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:21.790
and a bold world for me.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:56.442
And now Mrs. Florence Jacks...

01:21:57.371 --> 01:22:00.238
I shall now read the winners.

01:22:00.457 --> 01:22:03.073
My decision is irrevocable.

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:07.335
You're lucky I don't wanna
mess up my hair right now.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:08.754
Or I'd beat you up some more.

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:10.172
Third place...

01:22:10.676 --> 01:22:13.884
Petey McMichaels, 25 dollars!

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:17.429
Second place...

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.467
Kelly Keester, 50 dollars!

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:27.477
Miss Kelly Keester,

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:31.269
50 dollars,
United States Savings Bond!

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.272
Kelly Keester!

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.278
Second place is very good.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:49.161
First place with
complete originality

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:51.170
like Mark Twain...

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.800
Lydia Johnson!

01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:59.429
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

01:23:02.352 --> 01:23:04.468
75 dollars!

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:07.305
Yeah, louder! Come on!

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:10.940
Yes, yes, yes, Lydia!

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:16.655
Yes, Lydia!

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:18.781
Thank you!

01:23:19.077 --> 01:23:21.409
This is the end of our assembly!

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:23.453
Yes!

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:26.164
Lydia, you did it!

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.583
I can't believe it's 75 bucks!

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.369
You think
I'm gonna give you my money?

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.580
- No.
- See, you don't know me.

01:23:33.258 --> 01:23:34.418
I'll let you have some.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:36.115
Go fix your hair
if you hate yourself,

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:37.384
and you're so desperate.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:38.803
But I think it looks okay.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.546
I don't care
about my hair anymore.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.631
You keep it.
You earned it!

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:54.768
What are you doing?

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:57.320
What are you doing?

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.121
I don't care
what the honkies are gonna say!

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:11.584
Yeah!

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.954
Those honkies can kiss my ass!

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:16.214
You look beautiful.

01:24:39.199 --> 01:24:40.530
You don't have
hair like that.

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.992
You'll never have
hair like that.

01:24:45.872 --> 01:24:47.908
Maybe you're good-looking...

01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:50.040
and maybe you're not.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:53.160
But you're still alive.

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:24.775
You can do it!

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.452
Yes! Come on!

01:25:30.667 --> 01:25:31.827
You can do it, Jim!

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:34.456
- Come on, Dad, jump!
- Yes, yes!

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.928
Come on, Dad, dump it!

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.839
Throw it away!

01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:48.765
Come on, Dad!

01:26:27.974 --> 01:26:29.134
You did it!

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:36.430
Look at your beautiful
bald head!

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.265
You look like a dolphin.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:40.688
Oh!

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.945
Come on, flipper.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:56.704
We did it!

01:27:21.862 --> 01:27:23.102
I love you guys.
