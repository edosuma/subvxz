that could ID
the team members.

41:36.287 --> 41:38.331
So it looks like
whoever tortured Greene

41:38.373 --> 41:39.916
wants revenge
for that raid,

41:39.958 --> 41:43.670
and he's willing to go
to great lengths to get it.

41:43.712 --> 41:45.380
Greene died
protecting us.

41:45.422 --> 41:47.924
It's because of him
our identities are safe.

41:47.966 --> 41:51.428
Yeah, but we have to assume
that whoever killed Greene

41:51.469 --> 41:53.138
is gonna keep after it
until they figure out

41:53.179 --> 41:54.389
who was on that op.

41:54.431 --> 41:55.682
So it's only
a matter of time

41:55.724 --> 41:57.892
before we all have targets
on our backs.

41:57.934 --> 42:03.314
**

42:06.026 --> 42:15.827
**

42:15.869 --> 42:25.628
**

42:25.670 --> 42:35.513
**
