 Red meat and high explosives!

00:23.523 --> 00:24.723
 NARRATOR:
 They're testing the myth

00:24.724 --> 00:27.526
 that blasting the heck
 out of low-grade steak

00:27.527 --> 00:30.527
 with high explosives
 makes it so much softer.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.665
 [ Normal voice ] That's awesome!
 I love results!

00:33.666 --> 00:36.666
 NARRATOR: Then Kari gets
 to torture Grant and Tory...

00:37.404 --> 00:39.304
 KARI: I knew that
 we were gonna make him angry,

00:39.305 --> 00:41.940
 but I didn't realize
 he'd be this angry.

00:41.941 --> 00:44.143
 NARRATOR:... to see
 if stressed-out drivers

 Adam, I thought we talked

01:40.667 --> 01:42.334
 about doing that
 while you're at work.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.436
 [ French accent ] Ha ha!
 Oh, Jamie, mon frÃƒÂ¨re,

01:44.437 --> 01:47.437
 you know, many fans have written
 to us over the years and said,

01:47.440 --> 01:50.440
 "Mythbusters, is a hammer the
 best way to tenderize my steak?"

01:52.212 --> 01:54.780
 Now thanks
 to a viewer submission,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.448
 we may have a new technique,

01:56.449 --> 01:58.684
 for we might replace this...

01:58.685 --> 02:00.853
 avec this.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.955
 The question
 we'll be answering is --

02:02.956 --> 02:05.956
 Can you tenderize a steak
 with explosives?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.261
 [ Laughs evilly ]

02:09.262 --> 02:11.964
 Oh, it went out.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.965
 NARRATOR: Over the years,
 we've used explosives...

02:16.536 --> 02:19.505
...to answer all sorts
 of vital questions.

02:19.506 --> 02:22.506
 Can they clear
 a clogged-up cement truck?

02:23.977 --> 02:26.977
 Can they help cushion a fall?

02:27.180 --> 02:30.180
 And can they make
 a surfable wave?

02:32.085 --> 02:35.085
 Now it's time to open the fridge
 on combustible condiments.

02:37.056 --> 02:40.056
 So, Adam, if we were
 using explosives on steaks,

02:40.226 --> 02:42.227
 wouldn't it just
 blow up the steak?

02:42.228 --> 02:43.896
 I'm going to go without
 the accent now, okay?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.097
 -lt's too hard.
 -Okay.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.533
 [ Normal voice ] No, it won't.
 The technique we'll be testing

02:47.534 --> 02:50.035
 involves putting the meat
 into a vacuum-sealed bag,

02:50.036 --> 02:52.771
 putting that
 into a barrel of water,

02:52.772 --> 02:54.706
 and then detonating
 a small amount of explosives

02:54.707 --> 02:55.774
 in the water.

02:55.775 --> 02:58.775
 The theory is that the shock
 wave created by the explosive

02:59.078 --> 03:00.512
 will actually tear apart

03:00.513 --> 03:02.381
 microtissue fibers
 within the meat,

03:02.382 --> 03:04.383
 rendering it
 a heck of a lot more tender.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.751
 NARRATOR:
 A steak's tenderness

03:05.752 --> 03:08.752
 depends very much
 on where it's cut from the cow.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.590
 Meat from the short ribs
 is super soft.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.591
 Meat from the neck
 and the rump -- not so squishy.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.095
 It's all due to the strength

03:17.096 --> 03:19.965
 of the connective tissue
 between muscle fibers.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.601
 The weaker the tissue,
 the softer the meat.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.602
 Two common ways
 to break those bonds

03:25.772 --> 03:28.772
 are powdered-pineapple enzymes
 and a sound thrashing.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.344
 But the fans want to see

03:32.345 --> 03:35.280
 this third method
 thoroughly investigated.

03:35.281 --> 03:38.281
 If you're gonna tenderize meat
 with explosives,

03:38.284 --> 03:39.818
 it's not like
 you're just gonna throw

03:39.819 --> 03:42.588
 a stick of dynamite on the steak
 and expect it to work.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.389
 You've got to put it in water

03:44.390 --> 03:46.692
 because the water
 is actually gonna transmit

03:46.693 --> 03:49.693
 the pressure of the blast wave
 a lot more effectively.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.564
 And you also don't want
 to contaminate the meat.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.333
 You've got to seal it
 in something.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.568
 So we're gonna
 vacuum-bag this meat

03:56.569 --> 03:58.537
 in some really tough plastic.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.372
 NARRATOR:
 These crash-test steaks

04:00.373 --> 04:03.373
 are all relatively
 low-grade select cuts.

04:03.643 --> 04:06.178
 So there's plenty of room
 for improvement.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.547
 They're sealed and delivered --

04:08.548 --> 04:11.548
 not to the kitchen,
 but the bomb range.

04:12.018 --> 04:13.485
 [ French accent ]
 By popular demand,

04:13.486 --> 04:16.486
 today we are joining
 two of my favorite things --

04:17.156 --> 04:20.156
 red meat and high explosives!

04:21.127 --> 04:23.528
 [ Laughs ]

04:23.529 --> 04:24.863
 JAMIE:
 What we're creating here

04:24.864 --> 04:27.864
 is a shock wave that is
 traveling at supersonic speeds,

04:28.167 --> 04:31.167
 and it is just ripping apart
 all those little fibers

04:31.904 --> 04:34.904
 that make up the muscle of
 the meat -- Hence, it's tender.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.210
 NARRATOR: As to how much
 explosive they need --

04:38.211 --> 04:40.812
 well, they'll find that out
 by trial and error.

04:40.813 --> 04:43.813
 Tenderizing steak
 with explosives in 3...

04:44.584 --> 04:46.285
 2... 1...

04:46.286 --> 04:48.220
 ADAM: Whoa!

04:48.221 --> 04:49.554
 JAMIE:
 [ Laughs ]

04:49.555 --> 04:52.555
 Jamie, I think
 that was too much explosives.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.360
 NARRATOR:
 Some chefs add too much salt.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.265
 Some go nuts with the garlic.

05:00.266 --> 05:03.266
 But Frank's added
 way too much C-4.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.037
 What can you say?
 This recipe is just plain wrong.

05:08.574 --> 05:11.574
 Everything else is gone,
 but the steak is here...

05:11.811 --> 05:14.446
 Sort of.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.382
 NARRATOR: So, while Adam
 and Jamie recalibrate,

05:17.383 --> 05:20.383
 let's jump-start
 our second myth.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.361
 [ Growls ]

05:29.362 --> 05:31.663
 Aah!
 Okay, I'm relaxed!

05:31.664 --> 05:34.664
 What does a shoulder massage
 have to do with fuel efficiency?

05:35.201 --> 05:36.835
 Well, according to this myth,

05:36.836 --> 05:39.271
 the idea is that if you're
 driving and you're relaxed

05:39.272 --> 05:41.006
 and you're happy,
 you'll save a lot more fuel

05:41.007 --> 05:42.841
 than if you're angry
 and stressed out.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.842
 So, if you want save fuel,
 don't drive angry.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.547
 Precisely.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.548
 NARRATOR: It's a widely accepted
 fact that bad driving habits

05:51.951 --> 05:54.353
 like stopping
 and starting abruptly

05:54.354 --> 05:57.354
 result in less fuel efficiency.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.523
 But could the simple act
 of driving stressed

06:01.027 --> 06:04.027
 turn an otherwise careful
 motorist into a gas-guzzler?

06:05.998 --> 06:07.766
 You know, I really like
 the sound of this myth.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.767
 We get to relax, kick back,
 and then take a little drive.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.171
 You know, it's not gonna be
 all easy, though.

06:13.172 --> 06:15.073
 It sounds like we're gonna
 have to get stressed out, too.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.908
 In fact,
 I think it's gonna be dangerous.

06:16.909 --> 06:18.276
 So we're not gonna do this
 on the road.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.711
 We're gonna go
 to an abandoned neighborhood,

06:19.712 --> 06:21.546
 and I'm gonna set up a course.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.082
 NARRATOR:
 And this is the test track --

06:24.083 --> 06:26.818
 a once-thriving
 California suburb

06:26.819 --> 06:29.154
 that someone pulled the plug on.

06:29.155 --> 06:30.489
 TORY:
 This is Cypress Knolls.

06:30.490 --> 06:32.924
 It's an abandoned
 military-housing neighborhood,

06:32.925 --> 06:35.227
 and the city of Marina
 has agreed to let us use it.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.095
 And there are plenty
 of neighborhood streets.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.297
 And we are gonna be
 tearing around these streets

06:39.298 --> 06:42.298
 to see if you use more fuel
 when you drive stressed.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.802
 NARRATOR: These streets haven't
 seen traffic for 15 years.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.072
 So for the test car,
 we've gone retro-rusty.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.643
 This is the car that
 we're gonna use for our test.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.179
 Now, it's pretty old and it
 doesn't get great gas mileage,

06:54.180 --> 06:55.280
 but that doesn't matter.

06:55.281 --> 06:56.748
 What we're trying to test here

06:56.749 --> 06:59.749
 is whether or not driving
 stressed out or driving calm

07:00.553 --> 07:02.521
 has a difference on whether
 or not you use more fuel.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.522
 NARRATOR: And to get
 a precise reading on fuel usage,

07:05.691 --> 07:08.691
 they'll bypass the car's
 gas tank for a gas bag.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.530
 GRANT:
 What we're doing is measuring

07:11.531 --> 07:14.531
 the fuel before and after,
 but not by volume,

07:15.034 --> 07:17.769
 but actually by weight
 so that it's more precise.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.838
 NARRATOR:
 Now for a few practice laps,

07:19.839 --> 07:22.839
 just to get a feel for the car
 and the old neighborhood.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.111
 All right, who goes first?

07:26.112 --> 07:29.112
 -BOTH: Rochambeau.
 -All right.

 Dynamite.

 [ Laughing ]
 There's no dynamite!

07:32.652 --> 07:35.652
 You're pointing at me.
 That means I go first.

07:36.889 --> 07:39.157
 NARRATOR: Kari's marked out
 a four-mile course that,

07:39.158 --> 07:40.859
 like most racetracks,

07:40.860 --> 07:43.495
 finally brings you back
 to where you started.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.496
 Grant's the first
 to try a test lap.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.632

 then turn left.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.040
 [ Engine turns over ]

07:55.041 --> 07:58.041
 NARRATOR: Then Tory
 tries cruising the cul-de-sacs.

08:00.546 --> 08:03.415
 It's like
 a modern-day ghost town.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.550
 Turn left on Lindsay Street,

08:05.551 --> 08:07.752
 then arrive
 at smashed computers.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.988
 All right,
 looking for smashed computers.

08:09.989 --> 08:12.989
 Does this GPS sound
 condescending, or is it just me?

08:13.693 --> 08:15.660
 Am I the only one
 that feels this way?

08:15.661 --> 08:16.962
 Turn right on 4th Avenue.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.630
 And I'm the sole survivor,

08:18.631 --> 08:21.631
 searching --
 searching for a lone survivor.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.301
 Hopefully, it's a female
 so I can start procreating.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.305
 NARRATOR:
 That's enough of that,

08:27.306 --> 08:28.740
 though it might surprise Tory

08:28.741 --> 08:31.376
 to learn that
 a rather more wholesome fantasy

 awaits him
 just around the corner.

 are testing a viewer myth

08:42.087 --> 08:45.088
 that low-grade steaks can be
 tenderized with high explosives.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.826
 So far, it's a total bust.

08:49.896 --> 08:52.497
 ADAM: Now we're gonna pull it
 back in the other direction

08:52.498 --> 08:55.498
 and detonate what is essentially
 an extra-large firecracker

08:56.035 --> 08:57.736
 full of aluminized black powder,

08:57.737 --> 08:59.771
 which is
 a fairly low-speed explosive,

08:59.772 --> 09:01.273
 as opposed to what we just used.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.974
 It requires a fuse to light it.

09:02.975 --> 09:05.143
 Now, getting a fuse
 to light into water

09:05.144 --> 09:08.144
 is not undoable,
 but it's a little finicky.

09:08.814 --> 09:11.583
 NARRATOR:
 Finicky for some, but for Jamie,

09:11.584 --> 09:14.584
 it's just like
 shooting fish in a barrel.

09:14.921 --> 09:17.921
 That was a nice, little blast.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.291

 It sure was.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.026
 The bucket's destroyed.

 But more importantly,
 how's the steak?

09:23.863 --> 09:25.730
 Well, that went perfect --
 The explosion went off,

09:25.731 --> 09:28.366
 and we didn't ruin
 our bag of meat.

09:28.367 --> 09:29.935
 Now, I can't tell
 anything specific

09:29.936 --> 09:32.003

09:32.004 --> 09:33.972
 The proof in any improvement

 who says he knows how
 to blast a steak to perfection.

 And they say that we've got to
 put a steel plate

09:52.091 --> 09:53.325
 at the bottom of the barrel,

09:53.326 --> 09:56.261

 in the air,

 And just for the record,

10:08.207 --> 10:11.207
 this one goes back
 to using high explosives.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.012
 So, we've done Baby Bear,
 and we've done Papa Bear.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.047
 This is Goldilocks, right?

10:16.048 --> 10:18.249
 This is the recommended recipe

10:18.250 --> 10:21.250
 in 3.. .2... 1...

10:23.522 --> 10:24.923
 JAMIE:
 Oh, look at that.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.924
 NARRATOR: Boom time
 for fans of exploding meat.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.663
 And just like last time,
 the steak is...

10:31.664 --> 10:33.531
 ADAM:
 Not breached!

10:33.532 --> 10:36.401
 NARRATOR: And that means
 it's time to get cooking.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.402
 As the sun goes down,
 the barbie fires up.

10:40.272 --> 10:42.741
 So, let's meet the meat.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.509
 Now, the first one
 is a low-grade steak.

10:44.510 --> 10:47.012
 It's not been altered
 or tenderized in any way.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.214
 The second one is
 that same low-grade steak,

10:49.215 --> 10:51.449
 but we tenderized it
 with a low explosive.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.450
 The third one we've tenderized
 with a high explosive.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.022
 And the fourth one
 we've tenderized

10:57.023 --> 11:00.023
 with a pineapple-enzyme
 commercial preparation.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.092
 Now, the last one is a prime
 steak that's been aged 28 days.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.164
 We're gonna test all of these

11:06.165 --> 11:07.966
 and see which one
 is the most tender.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.335
 NARRATOR: And so as not
 to influence the results,

11:10.336 --> 11:13.238
 Adam adds a touch of color.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.907
 We have five different
 cuts of meat to cook and test.

11:15.908 --> 11:18.309
 Each of those cuts of meat
 has been assigned a color,

11:18.310 --> 11:19.778
 which matches to these pans

11:19.779 --> 11:21.980
 and our little
 taste-test bowls here.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.582
 NARRATOR: To ensure there's
 no bias from the barbie,

11:24.583 --> 11:27.583
 steak chef Joe Kohn cooks
 all five cuts just the same.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.191
 And another celebrity chef

11:33.192 --> 11:36.192
 has been invited to dine
 in the dirt.

11:36.395 --> 11:37.662
 ADAM:
 We're bringing in Ron Siegel,

11:37.663 --> 11:39.831

 at the Ritz-Carlton,

 Thank you.

 Let the chewing commence.

12:09.995 --> 12:10.829

12:10.830 --> 12:13.830
 Three different tasters and
 three totally different results.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.201
 For this myth to be true,
 the order should be

12:18.571 --> 12:21.571
 red, yellow, blue, pink,
 then green.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.176
 But no one agreed on anything,

12:25.177 --> 12:28.046
 and that's got Adam worried.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.814
 Even though we had
 five different samples here,

12:29.815 --> 12:32.815
 the main thing we wanted to see
 was that the green --

12:32.918 --> 12:34.753
 the high-explosive
 tenderized meat --

12:34.754 --> 12:37.754
 would be rated higher
 than the red, our control.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.424
 And even though I did that,

12:39.425 --> 12:41.559
 neither Ron nor Jamie
 felt like that.

12:41.560 --> 12:44.129
 So, right now, it's not
 looking that good for this myth.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.965
 Let's get back to the shop and
 crunch the numbers. I'm cold.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.066

12:58.744 --> 13:01.744
 Don't do it drunk,
 distracted, or stressed.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.182
 Aside from the danger,

13:04.183 --> 13:07.183
 driving under duress
 might add to your fuel bill.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.686
 And that's today's
 motoring myth.

13:12.925 --> 13:15.925
 Later on, we'll try to redline
 Grant and Tory's stress levels.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.498
 Oh, you suck!

13:20.499 --> 13:23.499

 a nice, calm comparison test.

 And Kari knows just how to put
 the boys into a mellow mood.

 Tory slips next door

17:41.093 --> 17:42.960
 We clearly have
 too many variables in the mix

17:42.961 --> 17:45.696
 because we could run this test
 a dozen more times,

17:48.834 --> 17:51.834
 Yeah, I think having humans
 involved is the problem.

 We need to have a mechanical,

17:55.674 --> 17:58.409
 And, for that matter,
 I was thinking about it,

 the hardware,

18:14.159 --> 18:15.526
 and the real estate

18:15.527 --> 18:18.527
 to build a cannon as long as
 a four-story building is high.

18:20.432 --> 18:23.432
 As a tenderizer,
 it's total overkill,

18:24.236 --> 18:27.171
 and that's why we're doing it.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.172
 Today's target is simply meant
 to stop the steak cold.

 all over the room.

 between unmodified meat
 and "cannon con carne,"

18:56.435 --> 18:58.803
 Adam's cut each steak in two.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.571
 One half gets blasted,

19:00.572 --> 19:03.572
 and the other control cut
 doesn't.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.676
 So, your very rational question
 might be,

19:05.677 --> 19:07.912
 why go through all the trouble
 to make every steak

19:07.913 --> 19:09.881

19:12.684 --> 19:14.652
 That's fat
 and connective tissue.

 Now, while a good portion of
 this makes the steak delicious,

19:17.489 --> 19:19.056
 it also makes it inconsistent.

 There are several simple ways

22:40.692 --> 22:43.527

22:59.611 --> 23:02.611
 So, the first thing
 I thought of was a dryer

23:02.647 --> 23:05.483
 because, you know,
 it's that kind of motion,

23:05.484 --> 23:08.085
 and if you put a steak

23:08.086 --> 23:09.687
 or anything you want
 to tenderize in there,

23:09.688 --> 23:12.256
 sooner or later, it's got to
 loosen all those fibers up

23:12.257 --> 23:14.158
 and make it nice and tender.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.459
 NARRATOR:
 Sounds straightforward.

23:15.460 --> 23:18.460
 But to make it work, the dryer
 needs some, uh, modifications.

 that's the slit right there.

 into our dryer

 Above the blade
 is a pressure gauge,

 which, as the blade
 pushes through the meat,

 that meat.
