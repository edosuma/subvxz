Shivani.
Yeah?

09:47.935 --> 09:49.327
what are you doing here?

09:49.371 --> 09:51.025
I bought this place out.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.472
Why would you buy this place?
It's derelict.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.343
Her company delves
into scientific anomalies

10:05.387 --> 10:07.215
to stay
cutting edge.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.695
They were in town to take
a look at the St. Elmo's fire.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.784
She must've
tapped into something.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.655
Making whatever evidence
we might find

10:12.699 --> 10:15.092
about to disappear into the
hands of a private tech company.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.792
Okay, but maybe not, all right?
I have a relationship with her.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.315
You know, I c--
I could go in there.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.578
I could suss it out
and then slip away

10:22.622 --> 10:23.797
and take off
after whatever we need.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.668
Okay?

10:25.712 --> 10:27.496
Okay.

10:27.539 --> 10:30.934
If you need backup,
call me, okay?

10:30.978 --> 10:32.588
Yes.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.158
All right. [knocking on door]

10:37.201 --> 10:38.289
Hey.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.900
Missed you
at Max's earlier.

10:39.943 --> 10:43.468
Well, I do still have a day job.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.905
Are you sure it doesn't
have anything to do

10:44.948 --> 10:46.602
with a certain
blonde alien

10:46.646 --> 10:48.082
with a mean
left hook?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.736
Actually, I have a date.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.781
Oh.
You need something?

10:51.825 --> 10:55.437
Yeah, I, uh, just wanted to talk
to you about some side effects.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.265
Something wrong?

10:57.308 --> 10:59.789
I can call Liz. I'm sure
she'll drop everything.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.748
We can do a full workup and
make sure that everything is...

11:01.791 --> 11:03.967
Oh, no, thank you, that's
exactly what I don't want.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.973
I'm just feeling a little...

11:10.017 --> 11:11.627
sore, achy.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.063
Okay.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.978
Um... Let me
give you something.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.460
Let's see...

11:20.331 --> 11:23.334
Yeah, here we go.
Okay, uh...

11:23.378 --> 11:26.294
So take two of these
and drink plenty of water.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.122
Great. All right.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.732
Thanks, doc.

11:29.776 --> 11:34.824
Our government's priority
is to suppress the truth.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.174
MICHAEL:
For the record,
this is gonna be pointless.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.524
DALLAS:
Watch and learn.

11:39.568 --> 11:41.222
So you'll forgive my reticence
to meet with you

11:41.265 --> 11:43.790
given your friend at the FBI.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.226
No, I get it, I get it. Fair.

11:45.269 --> 11:47.228
But, I mean,
it ain't a bad thing

11:47.271 --> 11:50.535
to have an in at the FBI for,
you know, believers like us.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.799
Mm-hmm.
I mean,
for all we know,

11:52.842 --> 11:54.583
the feds are behind
the conception

11:54.626 --> 11:56.193
of some of the more outlandish
conspiracy theories.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.936
Yes. That way, anyone
questioning the official story

11:59.980 --> 12:02.504
seems like a, you know,
paranoid wack job

12:02.547 --> 12:03.853
by association.
Yeah, exactly.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.637
Like, one secret about, uh,

12:05.681 --> 12:08.162
bio government weapon
gone wrong gets out, right?

12:08.205 --> 12:11.208
Suddenly that becomes
a lunatic on Reddit

12:11.252 --> 12:13.733
talking about an army
of lizard people. Come on.

12:13.776 --> 12:15.647
It's all calculated.Yeah.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.214
You know, they have, uh,

12:17.258 --> 12:18.781
secret underground bases
all over the world...

12:18.825 --> 12:20.696
All over the world....tracking this stuff.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.567
Don't even get me
started on the...BOTH: Denver Airport.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.395
MICHAEL:
Glad you made
a geek buddy, but...

12:24.439 --> 12:26.049
DALLAS:
Just winding up for the pitch.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.095
Hey, I, um,

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
I think...

12:30.314 --> 12:32.752
I might have something
that you might be interested in.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.015
You know, as a fellow believer.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.408
MICHAEL:
What are you... Are you insane?

12:37.452 --> 12:39.323
DALLAS:
I seem to recall you agreeing

12:39.367 --> 12:41.761
to no backseat driving, Guerin.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.507
Wow.

12:49.551 --> 12:50.944
That's clearly a fake.

12:50.987 --> 12:52.510
[both laugh]

12:52.554 --> 12:55.383
Oh. All right.
So you're the, uh, expert?

12:55.426 --> 12:58.473
MICHAEL:
Ah, insulting him. That'll help.

12:58.516 --> 13:02.607
DALLAS:
Just seconds away from
the two of us becoming boys.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.435
Um...

13:04.479 --> 13:06.742
That sigil...

13:06.786 --> 13:08.831
in your newspaper, come on,

13:08.875 --> 13:10.528
obviously clip art.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.574
"Trusted government
source," my ass.

13:12.617 --> 13:14.794
[laughs]

13:14.837 --> 13:17.013
You're right about one thing.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.407
It wasn't a government source.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.191
Come on.

13:21.235 --> 13:22.671
All right, all right.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.848
Between you, me,
and us Ewoks, that source

13:25.892 --> 13:27.545
was my great-grandpa.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.026
Yup. Old Gareth

13:30.070 --> 13:32.333
was a bank security guard
back then.

13:32.376 --> 13:33.856
He saw that sigil

13:33.900 --> 13:37.120
on a case that was put
in a-a safety-deposit box.

13:37.164 --> 13:39.993
He didn't see what was in it,
but swears

13:40.036 --> 13:41.995
the case glowed.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.041
And he worked at the bank

13:45.085 --> 13:47.914
on West Pecos Bank and Trust
that got robbed?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.741
That's the
best part.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.352
It was a different branch.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.919
My gut tells me
whatever

13:52.962 --> 13:55.922
was in that box was alien.Hmm.

13:55.965 --> 13:59.490
Who knows, it could still
be there to this very day.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.061
Okay, if Bonnie mind controlled
that out of Graham,

14:05.105 --> 14:07.281
it's only a matter of time
before they hit up that bank.Yup.

14:07.324 --> 14:10.806
And Max will just intercept them

14:10.850 --> 14:12.025
and throw them in Jones's cage.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.635
All right, I take it

14:13.678 --> 14:15.028
you still think that's
the wrong way to go.

14:15.071 --> 14:16.638
One thousand percent.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.466
Okay, well, then
stick up for yourself.
No.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.296
There's no point.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.646
I am the screwup.
Max is the cop.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.256
Yeah, Max is a cop,

14:26.300 --> 14:28.215
but he's not the one
with the inside information.

14:28.258 --> 14:30.957
All right? You talked
to Bonnie, not Max.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.395
And if she is teetering
on the edge,

14:34.438 --> 14:37.224
I'd be you're the one that can

14:37.267 --> 14:39.443
tip her back to our side.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.620
Look, I'm with you.

14:42.664 --> 14:44.971
Locking her up,
it's only gonna radicalize her.

don't you?

14:59.681 --> 15:01.161
No. No, no, no, no.
Let's go.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.032
We can do
something else.
I love it.

15:03.076 --> 15:05.165
And I'm secretly
a fan of Moscato.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.515
Wow.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.299
Though it looks

15:12.128 --> 15:14.261
You know what?

15:14.304 --> 15:17.438
Why don't we break
Starfleet's prime directive

15:17.481 --> 15:19.701
and go mingle

15:19.744 --> 15:21.442
with an unknown civilization?

15:21.485 --> 15:22.747
Hm?
Hm.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.360
It's got a funny name,
but this pinot isn't half bad.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.970
Well...
[clears throat]

15:28.014 --> 15:29.885
I, for one, think Pinot Picard
is a great name,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.366
and I'm happy to be here
sipping it with you.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.804
ISOBEL: Resistance
is futile.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.414

You know what? Uh, gosh,

15:58.392 --> 16:00.002
we would love to stay,
but Kira and I were

16:00.046 --> 16:01.569
just headed to the VIP section,

16:01.612 --> 16:03.136
so it was really good
to see you.No way,

16:03.179 --> 16:05.486
so are we.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.140
Should we double date?

16:09.577 --> 16:12.014

You know, uh,

16:21.154 --> 16:23.243
I'll go search
for those weather balloons.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.593
Hey, everyone,

16:25.636 --> 16:27.160
early lunch.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.339
I know why you're here, Liz.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.254
Yeah, for the weather balloons

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
that were crushed
by the St. Elmo's fire.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.520
Oh, come on, St. Elmo's fire?
Let's talk locusts.

16:39.563 --> 16:42.653
Nothing on this earth can
explain what happened to them.

16:42.697 --> 16:45.134
You know what I think?

16:45.178 --> 16:47.441
I don't.

16:47.484 --> 16:50.922
I think something alien
brought you back to Roswell.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.323
Want to just skip the part
where you deny all of this,

17:00.367 --> 17:03.065
and I can just
tell you why I'm right?

17:04.414 --> 17:06.329
What brought me
to Roswell

17:06.373 --> 17:09.898
was the very same thing that
drew Allie and me to Careyes.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.295
We found something
not of this planet.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.906
Something that possessed
unique healing properties.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.039
Healing properties?
Mm-hmm.

17:21.953 --> 17:25.000
Is there someone personal
you needed to help?

17:27.655 --> 17:30.875
Our daughter was in
desperate need of help.

17:32.181 --> 17:33.835
And this was the first
glimmer of hope

17:33.878 --> 17:35.271
that we'd seen in a long time.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.620
I'm sorry.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.364
Was Allie able to help her?

17:41.408 --> 17:43.279
I haven't seen her in months,

17:43.323 --> 17:45.151
but I know she's
still working on it.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.109
So I have

17:47.153 --> 17:50.243
both her research
and my-my best

17:50.286 --> 17:53.202
and brightest,
my people working on it,

17:53.246 --> 17:55.117
and they are making
great strides.

17:55.161 --> 17:57.772
But, you know, the point
that matters to you...

18:00.035 --> 18:02.037
I'm already versed
in alien science.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.692
So you have
a choice to make:

18:04.735 --> 18:06.650
let me help you,

18:06.694 --> 18:09.653
or keep pretending there's
no elephant at the oil field.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.271
Taking the uncomfortable path
is never easy.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.192
The sample that brought me here

18:26.235 --> 18:28.150
had chemical markers
similar to the anomalies

18:28.194 --> 18:29.673
of the St. Elmo's fire.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.240
That's what I got,

18:31.284 --> 18:32.633
and I don't know
where to start.

18:32.676 --> 18:36.115
Well, you're in luck

18:36.158 --> 18:37.681
because I have got
the autoclaves

18:37.725 --> 18:39.640
and the centrifuges
and the jurisdiction.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.686
So you just share that
incredible mind of yours,

18:42.730 --> 18:44.384
throw in a couple
of milkshakes...

18:44.427 --> 18:48.127
My people will find
what you're looking for.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.349
[exhales]
Okay, come on, come on.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.397
Ah.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.660
[moans]

18:59.703 --> 19:02.489
Whew, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.577
Come on.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.448
Show me what Patricia hid.

19:07.494 --> 19:08.538
God, I'm an idiot.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.585
[shouts]

19:15.066 --> 19:17.156
[sighs]
Oh...

19:17.199 --> 19:19.027
So close.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.898
[sighs]

19:20.942 --> 19:22.770
What's going on with you?

19:22.813 --> 19:25.338
[inhales sharply, exhales]

19:25.381 --> 19:28.384
I did something stupid, okay?

19:31.082 --> 19:34.521
Sure, well, when it's not wine,
painting really relaxes me.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.000
I taught myself.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.263
KYLE: Wow.
That's impressive.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.221
You know, I love
going to galleries.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.440
Oh.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.486
Our flights are up.Kira,

19:43.530 --> 19:45.445
what do you say we go
grab them?
Sure.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.099
Okay. [chuckles]

19:49.579 --> 19:51.102
[mocking]:
I love going to galleries.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.180
the reason I want
this triad behind bars

is because, uh,

30:18.904 --> 30:21.732
Success.
Bonnie left a calling card.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.607
You okay?

30:26.650 --> 30:28.696
Yeah, I just hope
this was all worth it.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.569
You know, we should, uh...

30:32.613 --> 30:35.311
probably patch this wall up
pretty quick.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.489
Okay, you need to get your
blabbermouth date under control.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.708
Nice, Iz.

30:40.751 --> 30:41.709
It's not Kira's fault your date

30:41.752 --> 30:42.971
is going all Nancy Drew.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.712
My date is good
at her job.

30:44.755 --> 30:46.192
Maybe next time she should, um,

30:46.235 --> 30:47.758
hold a press conference,
you know,

30:47.802 --> 30:49.456
get the whole town
in on the hot gossip

30:49.499 --> 30:51.153
that could ruin
my brother's life.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.416
I wasn't the one who
suggested the double date.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.897
Her and I could've been
sipping Cosmoscato, alone.

30:55.941 --> 30:57.551
Yeah, well, maybe
I don't want to be alone,

30:57.594 --> 30:59.074
did you ever think about that?

30:59.118 --> 31:01.337
Wait, you...

31:01.381 --> 31:04.079
didn't want to be alone
with your own girlfriend?

31:06.168 --> 31:08.605
No, I really do want
to be alone with her.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.129
She's perfect.

31:10.172 --> 31:11.870
I want to be...

31:11.913 --> 31:14.873
sweet to her.
I want to be silly with her.

31:14.916 --> 31:18.441
I want to just wrap her up
in love, and I can't.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.052
Iz.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.314
[sobs]

31:21.357 --> 31:22.793
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, Iz.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.491
What's going on?

31:24.534 --> 31:26.885
[inhales, exhales]

31:29.278 --> 31:30.845
I mindscaped her, Kyle,

31:30.889 --> 31:32.499
to keep her
from the truth.

31:32.542 --> 31:35.676
After I told her
that I loved her,

31:35.719 --> 31:38.200
and now every time she looks
at me, all I can think is,

31:38.244 --> 31:41.247
"What if I'm
a terrible monster?

31:41.290 --> 31:42.291
What if I'm Noah?"

31:42.335 --> 31:44.076
You know,

31:44.119 --> 31:45.512
because if that's the case,
then she should just...

31:45.555 --> 31:47.601
she should run
as fast as she can.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.255
No. No.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.866
That's not true, okay?
You are not Noah.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.955
We both know that.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.217
It's okay.

31:57.176 --> 31:59.743
It's really not.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.529
It can be.

32:02.572 --> 32:05.097
Look, you're operating
from a place of fear.

32:05.140 --> 32:08.709
Okay? That makes you
act out of character.

32:08.752 --> 32:09.928
I've been there.

32:09.971 --> 32:14.367
So terrified of the unknown

32:14.410 --> 32:16.021
that I hurt people
really close to me.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.851
Transparency takes courage,

32:20.895 --> 32:23.028
but you're gonna have
to be honest with her.

32:24.899 --> 32:27.075
Or you're just
gonna keep

32:27.119 --> 32:28.947
sabotaging your relationships

32:28.990 --> 32:31.906
with painfully awkward
double dates.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.777
[laughs]

32:35.475 --> 32:37.433
I ruined your date, didn't I?

32:37.477 --> 32:40.262
Just a little.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.965
Thank you.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.752
I know you're right.

32:53.058 --> 32:55.756
I know I have to come clean.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.238
[sighs]

33:03.111 --> 33:05.896
I am glad we
got those keys

33:05.940 --> 33:07.768
and got to this
before they did.

33:09.944 --> 33:12.120
If only I still
had my powers,

33:12.164 --> 33:14.253
I could figure out
what it is.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.692
Talk to me.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.303
It's... [sighs]
It's just,

33:21.347 --> 33:24.524
as soon as I started to feel
connected to my family,

33:24.567 --> 33:26.830
poof, magic was gone.

33:27.831 --> 33:31.052
But, you know, most people
only have five senses,

33:31.096 --> 33:34.012
my sixth sense almost
killed me, so, you know,

33:34.055 --> 33:35.752
who am I to grieve
something that,

33:35.796 --> 33:38.668
not only was I lucky enough
to have, but...

33:38.712 --> 33:40.757
was lucky to survive?Okay.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.933
Um, so everyone else gets

33:42.977 --> 33:46.154
five stages of grief,

33:46.198 --> 33:48.504
but Maria DeLuca
only gets half a stage?

33:50.071 --> 33:51.464
Come on, I mean,

33:51.507 --> 33:53.988
why don't you, I don't know,

33:54.032 --> 33:55.903
allow yourself,
like, a heartbeat

33:55.946 --> 33:57.818
to process
all this?

33:57.861 --> 34:00.690
Yeah. I don't know.
I guess, you know,

34:00.734 --> 34:02.214
I'm a little hard
on myself sometimes.

34:02.257 --> 34:03.998
[laugh] You guess?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.130
You're literally
hard on yourself

34:05.173 --> 34:06.348
about being hard on yourself.

34:06.392 --> 34:07.958
Okay. All right.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.786
I don't walk around
knocking your hobbies.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.137
[laughs]

34:14.269 --> 34:16.402
I feel less alone now.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.578
I appreciate that, and you.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.406
You've known us for

34:20.449 --> 34:22.103
barely six months

34:22.147 --> 34:24.584
and somehow you manage
to be there for everyone.

34:24.627 --> 34:26.673
That's, um...

34:26.716 --> 34:29.284
That's really kind of you,
but, uh,

34:29.328 --> 34:31.112
it's not completely selfless.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.071
You know, you,

34:33.114 --> 34:34.768
Max, Michael,Isobel,

34:34.811 --> 34:37.292
being a SETI fanboy,
honestly, all of it,

34:37.336 --> 34:39.947
I'm just...

34:39.990 --> 34:42.732
I'm just soaking it
all up 'cause, um,

34:42.776 --> 34:46.040
it's all I have to help me
understand my past.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.216
If I still had my visions,
I would...

34:48.260 --> 34:51.306
[laughs] Maria,
Maria, come on.

34:51.350 --> 34:53.961
All right, peace
to that, okay?

34:55.441 --> 34:58.183
Because, you know,
being with you,

34:58.226 --> 35:00.141
that's what helps.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.970
Yeah. The closer
I get to...

35:03.013 --> 35:05.146
to all of you,

35:05.190 --> 35:08.193
the closer I feel to my father.

35:08.236 --> 35:10.804
And, uh, the closer the better,
you know?

35:10.847 --> 35:12.675
Yeah.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.418
[car approaching]

35:16.462 --> 35:18.464
Oh. Guess they're back.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.513

35:24.557 --> 35:26.167
How'd it go?

35:26.211 --> 35:29.518
Great. I mean,
getting the artifact

35:29.562 --> 35:32.260
before they showed up,
that was checkmate. Thank you.

35:32.304 --> 35:33.653
Well, we're happyto help.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.350
Um, here it is.

35:35.394 --> 35:36.525
All right.Keep it safe.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.179
Yeah, I will.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.659
I mean, we're still in the dark
about what they stole

35:39.702 --> 35:41.748
from the
Las Cruces bank,

35:41.791 --> 35:44.838
but, uh, maybe you saw something
in one of your visions?

35:44.881 --> 35:48.363
Nothing just yet, but, uh,
you know, she's working on it.

35:48.407 --> 35:50.191
Okay.
Okay.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.801
Well, we know it's
a delicate process.

35:51.845 --> 35:55.109
We're just trying
to dot every "I"

35:55.153 --> 35:57.285
'cause that third alien
is still out there.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.601
I'm so sorry! I didn't see you.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.087
Are you okay?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.485
[high-pitched ringing]

36:31.058 --> 36:33.930
[truck door opens,

36:35.802 --> 36:39.022
How'd you know we were
gonna hit that bank?

36:39.066 --> 36:40.241
I didn't.

36:40.285 --> 36:41.895
I just knew Max
would be there.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.984
We disagree on things.

36:48.336 --> 36:49.772
You could
let your partner know

36:49.816 --> 36:51.034
there's more tips
where that came from.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.604
You're Oasian.

36:55.648 --> 36:59.042
Part of the reason
I've never really fit in here.

36:59.086 --> 37:01.915
Yeah, well, I don't...

37:01.958 --> 37:03.525
I don't always know
where I fit in, either.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.702

37:13.796 --> 37:16.538
You know what quiets
the chaos in my head?

37:16.582 --> 37:18.932
Music.
Uh-huh.

37:18.975 --> 37:22.588
I could really use
some music right now.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.807
What if I taught you
how to make your own?

37:24.851 --> 37:27.854
And you'd have it
all to yourself.

keep your powers being gone

37:41.868 --> 37:44.740
No. I'm gonna have
to tell her at some point.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.612
You're, uh,

37:46.655 --> 37:48.527
you're hardwired to protect
the ones you love,

37:48.570 --> 37:50.224
and you always put others first.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.313
What am I,
St. Maria or something?

37:52.357 --> 37:53.923
[laughs]Brother, please.

37:53.967 --> 37:55.360
I have done bad things, okay?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.971
Okay, so, um,
why don't you tell me

37:58.014 --> 37:59.973
about one of those bad things
that you've done?

38:02.367 --> 38:03.890

going on there?

You're just willing to share
important things with him,

38:53.679 --> 38:54.941
but not me.

38:57.204 --> 38:59.032
That's not true.It is.

39:00.468 --> 39:03.297
Ever since I told you
I love you,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.038

everything,
