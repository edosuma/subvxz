You're wrong about Cyclops.

We're about restoring balance

00:26.589 --> 00:28.422
when our country forgets
the principles...

00:29.089 --> 00:31.881

to be a white man in America.

I am recording this message

How could I predict that you
would be elected president

02:28.089 --> 02:30.881
Fortunately,
I've planned for this, too.

02:32.214 --> 02:35.673
And the only way to stave off
mankind's extinction

02:35.756 --> 02:39.547
is with a weapon more powerful
than any atomic device.

02:40.130 --> 02:42.547

it to New York City.

06:24.798 --> 06:26.798

07:31.172 --> 07:32.547

where to drop them?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.214
I don't decide.

07:41.714 --> 07:43.589
I wrote a randomizing
algorithm

Excuse me?

08:00.673 --> 08:02.547

08:02.631 --> 08:04.589
You had a genius idea
20 years ago,

08:04.673 --> 08:07.673

08:07.756 --> 08:09.381

08:10.297 --> 08:12.255
Great, you stopped the clock,

08:12.339 --> 08:15.339
but what happens if

08:15.422 --> 08:17.172
you let it start up again?

08:17.881 --> 08:22.130
What happens
is we're right back
where we left off.

08:22.881 --> 08:26.381
Without a constant reminder
of otherworldly threat,

08:26.464 --> 08:28.673
the world's
superpowers would start

08:28.756 --> 08:31.631
pointing their arsenals
at each other again.

08:31.714 --> 08:35.297
What if I could make
every nuclear weapon
on the planet disappear?

08:35.381 --> 08:36.547
(scoffs):
Please!

08:36.631 --> 08:39.172
If that could be done,
I'd have already done it.

08:39.255 --> 08:42.381
Ah, but you're
just a man, Mr. Veidt.

08:42.464 --> 08:44.130
You have limitations.

08:44.214 --> 08:47.172
And I suppose
a woman doesn't?

08:47.255 --> 08:49.506
Of course I do.

08:49.589 --> 08:51.297
But...

08:51.381 --> 08:53.673
there is someone with...

08:53.756 --> 08:55.673
no limitations.

08:55.756 --> 08:59.506
So, you've come here

08:59.589 --> 09:02.589
'cause you think I can get
in touch with him on Mars,

09:02.673 --> 09:05.923
that I've got some
kind of... hotline.

09:06.005 --> 09:08.339
He's not on Mars.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.339
That's just a decoy,

09:10.422 --> 09:13.589
going through a series
of predetermined motions to...

09:13.673 --> 09:17.422
deter amateur sleuths
looking for any kind of pattern.

09:17.798 --> 09:19.172
I believe the actual
Dr. Manhattan

09:19.255 --> 09:21.881
is hiding out
on a moon of Jupiter.

09:21.964 --> 09:24.381
And what, dear girl,

09:24.464 --> 09:27.506
is that belief based upon?

09:27.881 --> 09:29.881
Manhattan emits a very specific

09:29.964 --> 09:32.089
radioactive frequency.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.798
I built a subspace antenna
to scan the galaxy and...

09:36.422 --> 09:39.839
lo and behold,
I got a ping.

09:39.923 --> 09:43.255
-A ping?

09:43.339 --> 09:44.547

09:44.631 --> 09:47.381

I launched a probe,

09:47.464 --> 09:50.547
and in exactly
five years, 72 days,

09:50.631 --> 09:52.673
nine hours, and...

09:52.756 --> 09:54.839
17 minutes, that probe

09:54.923 --> 09:56.339
will be
orbiting Europa,

09:56.422 --> 09:59.381
taking photo images of
the Big Blue Cheese himself

09:59.464 --> 10:01.297

back here to me.

10:01.381 --> 10:03.881

It seems like a lot
of effort just to be

10:03.964 --> 10:06.089
an intergalactic paparazza.

10:06.172 --> 10:10.005
So, what do you do when you got
your candid shot of Manhattan?

10:10.673 --> 10:12.839
Sell it to the tabloids?

10:13.714 --> 10:16.673
No. I just need
to confirm where he is

10:16.756 --> 10:19.422
before I destroy him
and take his power.

10:19.881 --> 10:23.839
-What?
-If I can take his power,

10:24.756 --> 10:26.589
I can fix the world.

10:26.673 --> 10:29.005
Disappear the nukes,
end starvation,

10:29.089 --> 10:30.339
clean the air.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.381
All the things
he should have done.

10:33.714 --> 10:36.130
I've already designed
a quantum centrifuge

10:36.214 --> 10:38.381
capable of absorbing
his energy,

10:38.464 --> 10:41.005
so I can transfer
it into me.

10:41.089 --> 10:43.130
I just can't afford
to build the thing.

10:43.214 --> 10:44.881
Veidt:
Ah.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.464
So, I was hoping

10:48.547 --> 10:51.923
you would stake me
$42 billion.

10:56.214 --> 10:59.506
And why would you hope that?

11:02.089 --> 11:04.214
Because I'm your daughter.

11:11.214 --> 11:12.589
That's impossible.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.506
-Why?
-For one,

11:15.964 --> 11:18.673
because I've never
given myself to a woman.

11:18.756 --> 11:20.172

12:01.547 --> 12:04.422
She shot herself up
with some of your legacy,

12:04.506 --> 12:06.547
and slipped out
into the night.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.339
And you didn't even
notice she was gone

12:08.422 --> 12:10.631

12:12.506 --> 12:15.506
She was not just
a cleaning woman.

12:16.297 --> 12:17.964
She was a thief.

12:18.047 --> 12:20.506

12:20.589 --> 12:23.047

12:23.130 --> 12:26.673
You have the audacity
to come here for a handout?

12:26.756 --> 12:29.172
When my parents died,

12:29.255 --> 12:32.005
I inherited wealth
beyond imagining,

12:32.089 --> 12:33.506
and I gave it away

to demonstrate

12:36.756 --> 12:39.673

-(Warden groans)

16:04.172 --> 16:05.798
(gasps)

16:12.464 --> 16:14.756
(gasps, pants)

16:17.255 --> 16:18.673
Warden: Aah!

16:21.214 --> 16:22.172
Shh, shh, shh!

16:22.255 --> 16:25.881
-(groaning)
-(shushing)

16:29.172 --> 16:31.047
It's almost over.

16:31.714 --> 16:33.547
(groaning)

16:33.631 --> 16:35.214
Master.

16:35.839 --> 16:38.547
-May I ask you something?
-Of course.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.172
The mask...

16:43.172 --> 16:45.589
Why did you make me wear a mask?

16:46.964 --> 16:49.297
-Because masks...
-(groans)

16:49.381 --> 16:51.047
...make men cruel.

16:51.130 --> 16:54.297
("Clair de Lune" playing)

16:55.255 --> 16:57.422
That's what you wanted?

16:57.881 --> 16:59.631
For me to be cruel?

17:01.255 --> 17:03.589
I had eight years to kill.

17:04.339 --> 17:07.547
Having a worthy adversary...

17:08.422 --> 17:10.422
helped keep me sane.

17:10.506 --> 17:13.089
(panting)

17:13.839 --> 17:15.923
Was I, Master?

17:17.547 --> 17:20.631
Was I a worthy adversary?

17:21.923 --> 17:23.631
No.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.798
But you put on a hell of a show.

17:35.923 --> 17:39.631
All:
Bye, Master. Bye, Master.
Bye, Master. Bye, Master...

17:39.714 --> 17:42.464
(voices murmuring)

17:43.756 --> 17:46.005
-Bye, Master.
-Goodbye, Master...

17:46.089 --> 17:47.798
Bye, Master. Bye, Master...

17:49.756 --> 17:52.297
(voices murmuring)

17:52.381 --> 17:54.005
Goodbye,
Master.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.047
Godspeed.

18:28.172 --> 18:30.339
Female (computerized voice):
Hello, Adrian.

18:30.422 --> 18:32.589
Welcome aboard.

18:32.673 --> 18:35.422
Please prepare
for launch in five,

18:35.506 --> 18:37.673
four, three,

18:37.756 --> 18:40.089
two, one.

18:40.172 --> 18:42.798
(rockets rumbling)

18:46.839 --> 18:49.005
(rumbling)

18:53.172 --> 18:55.839
Artificial gravity, enabled.

18:56.881 --> 18:59.047
Leaving atmosphere.

19:11.422 --> 19:12.881
Launch successful.

19:16.381 --> 19:20.631
Adrian, your return journey
to Earth has begun.

19:20.714 --> 19:22.964
To prevent dehydration,
starvation,

19:23.047 --> 19:25.172
and potential insanity,

19:25.255 --> 19:28.547
please step into the chamber
for preservation.

19:34.756 --> 19:38.089
Would you place your hands
on your hips, please?

19:42.923 --> 19:45.464
Excellent. Good night.

19:46.297 --> 19:49.339
(gases hissing)

19:49.422 --> 19:51.589
(spritzing)

20:19.631 --> 20:21.464
(clicking)

20:22.798 --> 20:24.297
(whirring)

20:24.798 --> 20:26.798
(hissing)

20:37.005 --> 20:38.714
My love,

20:38.798 --> 20:41.839
I know the timing
of this is not ideal,

20:41.923 --> 20:44.381
but I need to do this now

20:44.464 --> 20:47.297
because it's possible
he might say something.

20:49.297 --> 20:50.839
I'm your mother.

20:54.923 --> 20:57.172
(dings, whirring)

21:15.839 --> 21:18.005
You must be thirsty.

21:20.130 --> 21:21.964
(groans)

21:23.005 --> 21:24.923
I have to admit,

21:25.005 --> 21:26.923
I was pretty surprised

21:27.005 --> 21:29.923
when the images
from the probe came back,

21:30.005 --> 21:32.130
and I saw you,

21:33.005 --> 21:35.089
and your message.

21:35.172 --> 21:38.506
Were those bodies that
you made the letters with?

21:41.839 --> 21:46.130
Wow. There must be
a cool story behind that.

21:46.214 --> 21:49.506
-(grunts)
-But the fact that
you took the time

21:49.589 --> 21:52.297
to spell out "daughter..."

21:52.381 --> 21:55.255
it meant a lot
to be acknowledged.

21:55.339 --> 21:57.756
Especially since you
said you never would.

21:58.673 --> 21:59.756
(grunts)

21:59.839 --> 22:02.422
It must've been hard
to completely cave,

22:02.506 --> 22:05.089
to humble yourself like that,

22:05.964 --> 22:07.172
Dad.

22:09.381 --> 22:11.547
(weakly):
Manhattan...

22:12.422 --> 22:14.255
sent me there.

22:14.339 --> 22:16.506
He's here on Earth...

22:17.464 --> 22:20.339
passing as a human.

22:21.005 --> 22:23.547
Oh, I've known about
that for a while now.

22:24.255 --> 22:26.881
I'm going to destroy him
and absorb his power

22:26.964 --> 22:29.047
in about an hour.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.756
What?

22:31.214 --> 22:32.589
Manhattan.

22:32.673 --> 22:34.631
He's here in Tulsa,
right now.

22:34.714 --> 22:37.756
I brought you back so you
could be here in person

22:37.839 --> 22:40.297
to watch me achieve anything,

22:40.381 --> 22:42.798
having started from nothing.

22:44.255 --> 22:45.631
Hmm.

22:45.714 --> 22:47.964
Lady Trieu:
You should change
before we go.

22:49.422 --> 22:51.464
What's wrong
with what I'm wearing?

22:51.547 --> 22:55.130
I thought these were more
appropriate for a man your age.

22:57.464 --> 23:00.381
Hello, Mr. Veidt.
I'm Bian.

23:08.172 --> 23:10.631
You cloned your mother?

23:11.381 --> 23:14.381
I told you
he might say something.

23:14.464 --> 23:17.255
Woman (over PA):
The Millennium Clock
is now activated.

23:17.339 --> 23:19.297
All blue team personnel,
please report

23:19.381 --> 23:22.130
to the transport bay
for deployment.

23:23.464 --> 23:25.464
Veidt:
My God.

23:27.464 --> 23:30.130
You actually built it.

23:34.631 --> 23:37.297
(whirring)

23:44.339 --> 23:46.464
It's beautiful.

23:48.881 --> 23:50.339
Thank you.

23:51.506 --> 23:54.172
Now, we have
a god to kill.

23:56.673 --> 23:59.839
Let's roll out, shall we?

24:40.214 --> 24:43.130
Lady Trieu:
Hi. I'm here
to pick up my papers.

24:43.214 --> 24:45.923
Lady Trieu.
(chuckles)

24:46.005 --> 24:47.631
Never thought
I'd see you in the flesh.

24:47.714 --> 24:49.214
Well, take a good look.

24:49.297 --> 24:51.881
This is the last
time I'll be in it.

24:53.047 --> 24:54.422
The time capsule.

24:55.714 --> 24:58.255
-You have a good night, sir.
-Oh, you too, young lady.

24:58.339 --> 25:00.381
That's a great hat.

25:01.714 --> 25:03.881
Veidt:
Good God!

25:04.506 --> 25:06.506
Robert Redford is
still president?

25:06.589 --> 25:08.547
(chuckling):
Yeah, tell me about it.

25:12.798 --> 25:14.422
Hey...

25:15.089 --> 25:16.422
(chuckles)

25:16.506 --> 25:18.172
You know who you look like?

25:18.255 --> 25:20.547
-No, tell me.
-Adrian Veidt.

25:20.631 --> 25:22.964
-Huh.
-Ozymandias, huh?

25:23.047 --> 25:25.130
(chuckling)

25:25.839 --> 25:28.172
Not exactly, I mean, but...

25:28.255 --> 25:30.589
well, you could do
birthday parties and shit.

25:30.673 --> 25:32.756
(laughing)

25:33.756 --> 25:35.339
May I ask you

25:35.422 --> 25:37.464
what everybody thinks
happened to him?

25:37.547 --> 25:39.839
Oh, nobody cares.

25:39.923 --> 25:42.464
He ghosted 10 years ago.
Man's old news.

25:42.547 --> 25:44.839
But I heard...

25:44.923 --> 25:48.005
that one day, he just
walked into the jungle

25:48.089 --> 25:50.255
and never came back.

25:51.005 --> 25:54.839
He's living
with the animals,
like Tarzan or some shit.

25:54.923 --> 25:57.631
-That's absurd.
-Oh, yeah?

25:58.172 --> 25:59.839
So, what do you think
happened to him?

25:59.923 --> 26:03.047
He was stranded
on a moon of Jupiter,

26:03.130 --> 26:05.673
quietly going insane.

26:09.339 --> 26:12.464
(nearby warbling)

26:17.964 --> 26:19.881
Jesus Christ.

26:19.964 --> 26:22.130
(warbling continuing)

26:43.130 --> 26:45.214
(warbling)

26:49.339 --> 26:52.005
"Israel is desolate,

26:52.756 --> 26:55.881
"and her seed is no more.

26:56.255 --> 26:59.631
"And Palestine has
become a widow

26:59.714 --> 27:01.673
for Egypt."

27:01.756 --> 27:03.839
What?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.964
It's the end,
my friend.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.214
The end is nigh.

27:47.255 --> 27:49.214
Get the fuck off of me!

27:52.297 --> 27:54.673
(panting)

27:55.422 --> 27:57.964
(murmuring)

28:07.714 --> 28:11.756
Blake:
Jesus. That's Senator
Keene Sr., isn't it?

28:12.339 --> 28:15.172
Never would've had him
pegged as a secret racist.

28:15.255 --> 28:16.881
Shut up.

28:18.339 --> 28:20.464
Looks like you're getting
ready for quite a show.

28:20.547 --> 28:23.339
-You wanna tell me
what we're all waiting for?
-Man (over radio): Come in!

28:23.422 --> 28:25.798
-(rapid gunfire over radio)
-Fuck, are you there?

28:25.881 --> 28:27.506
Come in!

28:27.589 --> 28:29.214
Yeah. What's up?

28:29.297 --> 28:31.881
Abar just came
out of the house.
She's shooting at us!

28:31.964 --> 28:34.422
-(rapid gunfire
over radio)
-Shit.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.422
We got a situation.

28:37.506 --> 28:39.798
What do you mean,
we got a situation?

28:41.839 --> 28:45.130
Wade (quietly):
Stay cool.
Don't look at me.

28:47.130 --> 28:49.506
I said don't look at me.

28:49.589 --> 28:51.881
-Keene:
What the hell's going on?
-Wade: Sit tight.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.714
-Keene: Talk to me, goddammit!
-Wade: Soon as I get a chance,

28:54.798 --> 28:56.881
I'll get us
outta here.

28:56.964 --> 29:00.339
-Keene: Who's fucking shooting?
-Blake (mutters): Mirror Guy?

29:01.130 --> 29:02.881
It's Looking Glass.

29:02.964 --> 29:04.506
I don't give a fuck
if she's shooting back.

29:04.589 --> 29:05.839
You take the shot.

29:05.923 --> 29:08.881
These fuckers brought me
here to flip on Angela,

29:08.964 --> 29:11.964
then showed up at my house
to try and kill me.

29:12.047 --> 29:13.756
I came back to get something.

29:13.839 --> 29:17.381
-What the fuck's going on here?
-Keene: Fucking answer!

29:17.464 --> 29:20.839
-Who's the cage for?
-Wade: Damned if I know.

29:21.839 --> 29:23.381
Take the shot, goddammit.

29:23.464 --> 29:26.047
(whirring)

29:26.673 --> 29:28.005
(zaps)

29:31.673 --> 29:32.964
(gasping)

29:33.047 --> 29:35.047
-(murmuring)
-Man: Yeah!

29:44.214 --> 29:45.839
Jon...

29:47.005 --> 29:49.172
Holy shit.

29:49.673 --> 29:51.673
It worked.

29:53.130 --> 29:55.130
It worked.

29:56.923 --> 29:59.255
I got you!

29:59.339 --> 30:01.381
You blue fuck!

30:02.130 --> 30:04.214
I got you.

30:05.381 --> 30:06.923
(man grunts)

30:07.881 --> 30:09.214
Where is he?

30:09.297 --> 30:11.798
You can't stop it.
We've got him.

30:11.881 --> 30:13.881
-(bones crack)
-(man groans)

30:14.547 --> 30:16.631
-(man laughs)
-Where is he?

30:16.714 --> 30:18.589
He had all the power
in the world.

30:18.673 --> 30:22.422
Still too lazy or too stupid
to do anything with it.

30:22.506 --> 30:24.297
-(bones crack)
-(man screams)

30:24.381 --> 30:26.172
You got seven more left,

30:26.255 --> 30:28.297
then I'm gonna start
on your motherfucking teeth.

30:28.381 --> 30:29.297
Now...

30:29.381 --> 30:31.798
-(bones cracks)
-(man screams)

30:31.881 --> 30:33.214
...where is he?!

30:37.589 --> 30:40.798
Thirty-four years ago,

30:40.881 --> 30:45.130
Adrian Veidt unleashed
his monster on the world.

30:45.214 --> 30:49.297
No, not his giant
one-eyed octopus,

30:50.214 --> 30:52.339
but his puppet president.

30:52.422 --> 30:55.589
First, he took our guns.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.172
And then, he made us say sorry.

30:59.255 --> 31:01.214
Over and over again.

31:01.297 --> 31:02.673
Sorry.

31:02.756 --> 31:06.172
Sorry for
the alleged sins

31:06.255 --> 31:09.172
of those who died decades
before we were born.

31:09.255 --> 31:11.923
Sorry for the color
of our skin.

31:13.005 --> 31:17.005
All we wanted was
to get cops in masks,

31:17.089 --> 31:20.506
take some power back,
start ourselves a little
culture war.

31:20.589 --> 31:23.047
And if we control
both sides of it,

31:23.130 --> 31:24.714
then I could come riding up

31:24.798 --> 31:27.631
on a white horse,
right into the White House.

31:28.297 --> 31:31.631
Yeah, I'll admit,
it was a little half-baked.

31:32.339 --> 31:35.047
But then, three years ago,

31:35.130 --> 31:37.172
the White Night.

31:37.255 --> 31:40.547
We sent out a bunch of our
guys to get the war rolling,

31:40.631 --> 31:43.673
and it goes exactly as planned,

31:43.756 --> 31:45.756
until my phone rings.

31:45.839 --> 31:48.464
It's Mike over there,
and he's all fucked up.

31:48.547 --> 31:51.881
He tells me
he's calling from a payphone

31:51.964 --> 31:54.255
in Gila Flats, New Mexico.

31:54.339 --> 31:56.964
And that makes no sense
at all 'cause I just saw Mike,

31:57.047 --> 32:00.255
half-hour before
he drove off to shoot
some cops here in Tulsa.

32:00.339 --> 32:03.673
So, I said,
"Mike, how the fuck

32:03.756 --> 32:07.005
are you in Gila Flats,
New Mexico?"

32:10.547 --> 32:14.339
-Mike: I got teleported.
-He got teleported.

32:14.881 --> 32:17.422
Now, there's only one fella

32:17.506 --> 32:19.381
who can zap people
wherever he wants,

32:19.464 --> 32:23.172
and it just so happens
he was born in Gila Flats.

32:23.631 --> 32:26.881
Ladies and gentlemen,
our guest of honor,

32:27.339 --> 32:29.881
Dr. Manhattan.

32:29.964 --> 32:33.297
The most powerful
being in the world,

32:33.381 --> 32:36.089
incognito,
delivered unto us

32:36.172 --> 32:38.047
right here in Oklahoma!

32:38.130 --> 32:40.297
How can that be a coincidence?

32:40.381 --> 32:43.381
(quietly):
A thermodynamic miracle.

32:45.839 --> 32:49.422
Judd, Jane Crawford
got close to the family,

32:49.506 --> 32:53.005
while we spent
the next three years

32:53.089 --> 32:55.422
trying to figure out how
to catch little boy blue

32:55.506 --> 32:58.381
and get his brain
hopping around in time.

32:59.923 --> 33:02.089
When are you now, Doc?

33:06.464 --> 33:09.631
It's... 1985.

33:09.714 --> 33:12.631
All we ever see of stars are

33:12.714 --> 33:15.005
their old photographs.

33:15.631 --> 33:17.798
The bars are made
of synthetic lithium.

33:17.881 --> 33:19.839
Only way to get it is
from old watch batteries.

33:19.923 --> 33:21.381
We had to melt down
a zillion of them

33:21.464 --> 33:23.881
to make a cage this fucker
couldn't get out of,

33:23.964 --> 33:26.047
and now...

33:26.547 --> 33:28.839
it is time to melt him down.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.756
(cheering)

33:36.756 --> 33:39.255
When Judd got killed,
I couldn't resist

33:39.339 --> 33:40.964
inviting Agent Blake down here.

33:41.047 --> 33:45.297
See, she actually used to be
the Doc here's girlfriend.

33:47.297 --> 33:49.005
Seems only fair
someone who cares

33:49.089 --> 33:52.381
about him should be
here when he dies.

33:53.589 --> 33:55.714
You look stupid
in those panties.

33:56.172 --> 33:59.464
I'm about to become the most
powerful man alive, Laurie.

34:00.589 --> 34:04.255
Waving my dick in people's
faces is just overkill.

34:05.422 --> 34:07.506
Yee-haw!

34:07.589 --> 34:09.339
Let's get blue.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.547
(applauding, whooping)

34:11.631 --> 34:13.631
(panting)

34:13.714 --> 34:16.089
-Angela: Stop!
-(guns cocking)

34:19.464 --> 34:22.506
-Do not get in there.
-Blake: Angela.

34:24.464 --> 34:27.297
-What are you doing here?
-Just getting kidnapped,

34:27.381 --> 34:29.297
held against my will.
How about you?

34:30.631 --> 34:33.297
Listen to me. Whatever
you think is gonna happen

34:33.381 --> 34:35.381
when you turn this thing on,

34:35.464 --> 34:38.798
-it's not gonna happen.
-And how do you even know
what we're doing here?

34:38.881 --> 34:41.422
Because Lady Trieu knows.

34:41.506 --> 34:43.839
However long you've
been planning your shit,

34:43.923 --> 34:47.422
-she's been
planning hers longer.
-Keene: Come on, Angela.

34:47.506 --> 34:51.047
You're gonna say
whatever it takes
to save your husband here.

34:54.297 --> 34:55.464
Uh...

34:55.547 --> 34:57.714
I'm putting my gun down

34:58.339 --> 35:00.756
'cause I need you
to fucking listen.

35:00.839 --> 35:04.881
Trieu just told me an hour ago
that you were gonna try this,

35:04.964 --> 35:07.339
and that she was gonna stop you.

35:08.047 --> 35:10.506
If she wants to stop me,

35:10.589 --> 35:12.673
then where the hell is she?

35:15.381 --> 35:16.923
She's all over
your power source.

35:17.005 --> 35:19.422
-These batteries--
-We stole those
from her work site--

35:19.506 --> 35:21.589
Because she let you.

35:21.673 --> 35:24.297
You flip that switch,
it's only because she wants you

35:24.381 --> 35:27.047
-to flip it.
-Angela...

35:28.172 --> 35:32.005
I am gonna squeeze
your man like a grape

35:32.756 --> 35:34.714
and drink him all up.

35:35.589 --> 35:37.255
You can either watch me do it,

35:37.339 --> 35:38.839
or I can have
my guys put you down

35:38.923 --> 35:41.881
like the black bitch you are
and spare you the misery.

35:44.339 --> 35:46.464
(whispering):
Shoot this motherfucker now.

35:46.547 --> 35:48.214
Wade (whispers):
And then what?

35:53.422 --> 35:55.214
Don't do this!

36:00.214 --> 36:01.756
(mutters)

36:03.089 --> 36:05.714
(machine whirring)

36:08.798 --> 36:11.756
(whirring)

36:16.005 --> 36:18.339
(blasting)

36:18.422 --> 36:20.923
(high-pitched ringing)

36:21.005 --> 36:23.631
(muted groans)

36:31.255 --> 36:34.422
(muffled chattering)

36:35.631 --> 36:38.881
(high-pitched ringing
continuing)

36:40.005 --> 36:42.631
(muffled warbling)

36:47.172 --> 36:48.214
(vomits)

36:48.589 --> 36:51.297
-(magnet humming)
-(guns clanging)

36:52.673 --> 36:54.923
-(magnets humming)
-(guns clanging)

36:57.464 --> 36:59.506
Lady Trieu (echoes):
Detective Abar?

37:00.631 --> 37:02.798
I wasn't
expecting you.

37:03.839 --> 37:06.881
-I'm so sorry you
have to see this.
-What's happening?

37:06.964 --> 37:10.589
I'm fulfilling my promise
to your grandfather.

37:10.673 --> 37:14.255
He gave me your husband,
and I'm giving him justice.

37:16.798 --> 37:20.339
(warbling)

37:33.923 --> 37:36.005
(buzzing)

37:37.506 --> 37:39.339
Adrian?

37:40.839 --> 37:43.172
Ms. Juspeczyk,

37:43.255 --> 37:45.214
what a pleasant surprise.

37:45.673 --> 37:47.756
Aw shit.

37:47.839 --> 37:49.130
Am I dead?

37:49.214 --> 37:51.047
No.

37:54.422 --> 37:56.005
(grunts)

37:57.172 --> 38:01.172
But the night is young.

38:01.255 --> 38:04.339
(clapping)

38:05.881 --> 38:09.047
May I have your
attention, please.

38:09.506 --> 38:12.255
Your ears are probably
still ringing,

38:12.339 --> 38:15.130
and you may be
a little nauseated.

38:15.214 --> 38:18.547
It's a side effect
of the teleportation.

38:24.005 --> 38:27.047
Hey, where's
Senator Keene?

38:32.381 --> 38:36.881
Wait a second.
Is he... in there?

38:39.756 --> 38:42.297
(chuckles)
Let's let him out, shall we?

38:42.381 --> 38:45.089
He's not gonna wanna miss this.

38:48.214 --> 38:50.422
(wheel creaking)

38:51.839 --> 38:53.673
(gasping)

38:55.547 --> 38:56.923
Jesus! (grunts)

39:00.381 --> 39:02.047
Well...

39:05.506 --> 39:09.381
Thanks for catching
Dr. Manhattan.

39:11.089 --> 39:14.339
That's the only way
he wouldn't see me coming.

39:15.089 --> 39:19.673
But absorbing atomic energy
without filtering it first,

39:19.756 --> 39:23.798
it's gonna pop you
like a water balloon every time.

39:23.881 --> 39:28.339
-What do you want from us?
-Great question. Bian.

39:28.422 --> 39:31.714
Do you have that paper
Mr. Reeves gave me?

39:41.047 --> 39:45.589
"You represent the senior
leadership of Cyclops,

39:46.589 --> 39:49.214
"an organization
that has terrorized

39:49.297 --> 39:51.547
"and victimized men,

39:51.631 --> 39:54.923
"women, and children
of color for a century,

39:55.964 --> 39:59.047
"including this very place,

39:59.130 --> 40:03.005
"the site of the Greenwood
Massacre of 1921.

40:03.631 --> 40:06.881
"You have plundered,
and pillaged,

40:06.964 --> 40:09.798
"and murdered in the name
of white supremacy.

40:10.547 --> 40:13.297
-Your crimes--"
-Jane: Just do it.

40:14.631 --> 40:15.714
Excuse me?

40:15.798 --> 40:18.714
We don't wanna hear
your little speech.

40:18.798 --> 40:20.589
Just fucking do it.

40:21.339 --> 40:24.130
Do... what?

40:24.214 --> 40:27.422
You're gonna kill us, right?

40:27.506 --> 40:31.422
(scoffs) Oh yeah.
Of course I am.

40:31.506 --> 40:34.506
(panicked murmuring)

40:39.255 --> 40:41.339
(chattering indistinctly)

40:46.673 --> 40:49.631
(high-pitched whirring)

40:49.714 --> 40:50.923
(zaps)

40:51.005 --> 40:54.506
(gasps) Jesus fuck!

41:04.089 --> 41:06.881
(warbling)

41:10.798 --> 41:12.881
(zapping)

41:13.881 --> 41:15.964
(vomits)

41:16.047 --> 41:17.506
(panting)

41:17.589 --> 41:19.214
(Blake scoffs)

41:21.089 --> 41:22.714
Where are we?

41:23.422 --> 41:26.172
Karnak.
This is my office.

41:26.255 --> 41:29.255
Why the fuck would
he send us to your office?

41:31.047 --> 41:33.214
To save the day, of course.

41:34.923 --> 41:36.422
(clears throat)

41:36.923 --> 41:39.172
Where did you send them?!

41:39.923 --> 41:42.381
-Away.
-Away where?!

41:42.798 --> 41:44.714
Janey?

41:45.547 --> 41:48.089
What's up? Are you cold?
I can raise the temperature--

41:48.172 --> 41:50.255
Lady Trieu:
My father!

41:50.339 --> 41:53.089
Do you have any idea

41:53.172 --> 41:56.339
what it took for me
to bring him here for this?

41:56.714 --> 41:59.464
As far as I know, there is
no situation in Afghanistan

41:59.547 --> 42:02.464
currently requiring
my attention.

42:03.047 --> 42:06.339
Oh, you think I need
an audience for this?

42:06.422 --> 42:08.047
I don't.

42:15.547 --> 42:17.172
(beeping)

42:17.255 --> 42:19.422
(whirring)

42:21.464 --> 42:24.756
Jon, what's going on?

42:25.464 --> 42:28.339
The... cage is affecting me.

42:28.422 --> 42:31.297
It's hard to be present.

42:31.964 --> 42:33.798
Blake and the others,

42:33.881 --> 42:36.589
you sent them somewhere to help?

42:38.631 --> 42:40.005
Yes.

42:40.089 --> 42:42.464
Then, why didn't you send me?

42:45.673 --> 42:49.464
Because I don't wanna
be alone when I die.

42:54.923 --> 42:58.255
Don't touch the light, Angela.

42:59.964 --> 43:01.130
What light?

43:01.214 --> 43:03.589
(beeping, humming)

43:03.673 --> 43:05.589
(zaps)

43:05.673 --> 43:07.005
(yells)

43:10.964 --> 43:13.381
(screaming)

43:15.589 --> 43:16.756
(beeping)

43:16.839 --> 43:18.839
Tulsa, Oklahoma,
is that where we just were?

43:18.923 --> 43:20.506
-Blake: Yeah.
-When's the last time there was

43:20.589 --> 43:22.839
an extra-dimensional
incursion there?

43:23.255 --> 43:24.589
What?

43:24.673 --> 43:27.506
Baby squids falling
out of the sky--
when's the last time?

43:27.589 --> 43:29.255
Three weeks ago.

43:29.339 --> 43:32.130
-(keyboard clacking)
-(computer beeping)

43:33.839 --> 43:35.047
-(thwacks)
-Damn it.

43:37.673 --> 43:40.422
So, this is where
you sent it from?

43:40.506 --> 43:41.881
The big one,

43:42.547 --> 43:45.005
back in '85?

43:45.089 --> 43:47.547
-You told him?
-I didn't say shit.

43:47.631 --> 43:50.047
You knew?

43:50.130 --> 43:52.422
Did they tell
everybody in the FBI?

43:52.506 --> 43:54.297
You work for the FBI?

43:54.381 --> 43:56.714
I'm their top
vigilante hunter.

43:56.798 --> 43:59.005
You slaughtered
half of New York,

43:59.089 --> 44:00.339
single-handedly.

44:00.422 --> 44:02.631
-Unassisted mass
murder on a scale...
-Oh, God.

44:02.714 --> 44:04.547
...not seen in human history.

44:04.631 --> 44:07.756
I saved humanity,
you ignorant hayseed.

44:07.839 --> 44:09.798
Now, if you'd kindly
stop distracting me,

44:09.881 --> 44:13.172
I would very much
like to save it again.

44:15.506 --> 44:18.547
Tulsa, Oklahoma,
locked and loaded.

44:19.381 --> 44:22.631
(whirring)

44:22.714 --> 44:24.923
Dr. Manhattan:
Pay attention.

44:25.005 --> 44:27.798
You will all return
to your homes.

44:27.881 --> 44:30.547
Jon, tell me what to do.

44:30.631 --> 44:33.214
Angela, it's almost time.

44:34.381 --> 44:36.381
You need to go now.

44:36.464 --> 44:38.798
No, you have to fight.

44:39.881 --> 44:41.172
I can't hold myself together.

44:41.255 --> 44:43.381
You have to try!

44:43.881 --> 44:46.130
(beeping rapidly)

44:46.214 --> 44:48.798
(groans)

44:49.506 --> 44:53.089
You need to move away.
It's not safe.

44:53.756 --> 44:55.673
I'm not moving away.

44:55.756 --> 44:59.089
I'm here. I'm staying.

44:59.172 --> 45:01.297
You have to stay.

45:03.422 --> 45:05.547
(panting)

45:07.964 --> 45:09.381
Angela:
Jon!

45:09.839 --> 45:12.255
Jon, come back.

45:12.964 --> 45:14.631
Where are you?

45:23.839 --> 45:25.756
I'm in every moment...

45:26.964 --> 45:29.297
we were together,

45:31.130 --> 45:33.839
all at once.

45:34.422 --> 45:36.005
(sighs)

45:47.130 --> 45:49.964
I love you, Angela.

45:51.923 --> 45:53.964
(sobs)

45:55.255 --> 45:58.798
(exploding)

46:09.631 --> 46:12.172
-(levers clacking)
-Reruns.

46:12.631 --> 46:15.047
I'll show her
a goddamned rerun!

46:15.130 --> 46:16.881
You, there's a temperature
gauge in that corner.

46:16.964 --> 46:18.506
What's the current reading?

46:19.381 --> 46:21.756
-Forty-eight degrees.
-(machines whirring)

46:21.839 --> 46:25.089
Veidt:
Turn it down to 22,
exactly 22.

46:25.172 --> 46:26.506
(hissing)

46:26.589 --> 46:28.297
What the fuck
are you doing?

46:28.381 --> 46:31.506
Baby squids,
I designed them to be harmless,

46:31.589 --> 46:33.923
to dissolve shortly
after impact.

46:34.005 --> 46:37.297
No reason to incur damage
and casualties, but...

46:37.381 --> 46:40.381
if I freeze them
before transport,

46:40.464 --> 46:43.547
it'll be like firing
a Gatling gun from the heavens.

46:43.923 --> 46:46.297
Do you think we'll really
be able to save Jon?

46:46.381 --> 46:49.047
Oh, I'm sure Jon's dead already.

46:49.130 --> 46:52.381
But we have a window
of opportunity...

46:53.798 --> 46:57.297
while her precious
quantum centrifuge

46:57.381 --> 46:59.881
prepares his energy
for transfer.

46:59.964 --> 47:01.547
Transfer into what?

47:01.631 --> 47:03.214
Into...

47:04.047 --> 47:07.756
a most worthy adversary.

47:07.839 --> 47:10.839
Blake:
What's she going to do with
his power once she's got it?

47:10.923 --> 47:14.673
Veidt:
She claims she's
gonna fix the world.

47:14.756 --> 47:18.464
-Wade: How do you
know she won't?
-Veidt: Because she is clearly

47:18.547 --> 47:21.547
a raging narcissist
whose ambition

47:21.631 --> 47:23.714
knows no limits.

47:23.798 --> 47:26.673
It's hubris, literal hubris.

47:26.756 --> 47:30.130
Anyone who seeks to attain
the power of a god

47:30.214 --> 47:33.089
must be prevented at all
costs from attaining it.

47:33.172 --> 47:34.839
But, believe me, that girl

47:34.923 --> 47:39.673
will not rest until she has
us all prostrate before her,

47:39.756 --> 47:42.798
kissing her tiny blue feet.

47:45.714 --> 47:47.506
Raging
narcissist, huh?

47:47.589 --> 47:54.047
Opus esse uno,
unum cognoscendi.

47:55.798 --> 47:57.589
It takes one to know one.

48:00.756 --> 48:02.756
Everyone and everything

48:02.839 --> 48:07.089
within five square blocks
is about to be obliterated.

48:08.964 --> 48:11.631
I hope there's no one
down there you care about.

48:17.130 --> 48:19.756
Bian (echoing):
Detective Abar?

48:24.673 --> 48:26.047
Detective Abar?

48:26.130 --> 48:28.464
-(sirens approaching)
-Are you okay?

48:30.714 --> 48:32.964
You need to tell
your friends to leave.

48:33.047 --> 48:36.214
They have to go
or they'll get hurt.

48:36.297 --> 48:39.798
(sirens wailing)

48:46.089 --> 48:47.839
(tires screech)

48:48.506 --> 48:50.631
(guns cocking)

48:55.839 --> 48:58.506
(phone ringing)

49:01.422 --> 49:03.673
-(groans)
-(ringing continues)

49:07.839 --> 49:10.005
(phone ringing)

49:12.589 --> 49:16.339
-Hello?
-Blake (over phone): You need
to take cover. Where's Angela?

49:18.422 --> 49:20.047
Where's Angela?!

49:26.005 --> 49:27.798
(warbling)

49:30.381 --> 49:32.547
It's for you.

49:40.089 --> 49:41.714
-Hello?
-(on phone): It's Blake.

49:41.798 --> 49:43.964
You need to run,
right now! Get inside!

49:44.047 --> 49:45.923
They're coming any second!

49:46.005 --> 49:47.631
Oh. Where are you?

49:47.714 --> 49:50.422
They're coming from the sky!

49:53.214 --> 49:56.339
(warbling)

50:12.214 --> 50:14.255
-(frozen squid whizzes)
-(gasps)

50:14.589 --> 50:16.798
(squids whizzing, splattering)

50:26.255 --> 50:30.297
(splattering continuing)

50:32.506 --> 50:34.422
(yelling): No!

50:34.506 --> 50:37.798
(cracking)

50:37.881 --> 50:40.172
(panicked shouting)

50:40.255 --> 50:42.589
(screaming)

50:42.673 --> 50:46.255
(shouting)

50:50.130 --> 50:52.464
Blake (over phone):
Run, Angela! Fucking run!

50:53.506 --> 50:56.589
(squid clattering)

50:57.923 --> 51:00.923
(warbles)

51:05.422 --> 51:07.756
(rattling, warbling)

51:10.839 --> 51:13.964
(clattering)

51:15.631 --> 51:17.381

51:17.464 --> 51:20.464

51:26.297 --> 51:28.422
(grunting)

51:40.005 --> 51:43.130
(panting)

51:43.714 --> 51:45.339
(gasps)

51:56.714 --> 51:58.339
(sighs)

52:39.381 --> 52:42.714
They got the wind knocked outta
them when he zapped them here.

52:43.589 --> 52:45.214
But they're okay.

52:46.214 --> 52:48.381
They been
sleeping a while.

52:51.964 --> 52:54.839
-What do they know?
-Oh, not much.

52:54.923 --> 52:59.089
I told them you was on the way
and that I was family.

53:03.255 --> 53:05.214
Is he gone?

53:07.005 --> 53:08.589
Yes.

53:09.714 --> 53:11.297
He's gone.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.756
I'm sorry.

53:16.047 --> 53:19.547
How about her? Is she gone, too?

53:20.381 --> 53:22.255
Her, too.

53:23.422 --> 53:25.255
Not nearly as sorry about that.

53:25.339 --> 53:29.130
-(sighs)
-Making the deal
with her was his idea.

53:31.005 --> 53:33.714
He knew he was going to die.

53:36.839 --> 53:38.756
And you helped him.

53:42.172 --> 53:44.255
Well, we helped each other.

53:44.339 --> 53:47.631
He came to me right
after he met you.

53:50.339 --> 53:51.631
You take my pills?

53:58.297 --> 54:00.089
I did.

54:00.172 --> 54:02.130
Ah.

54:04.255 --> 54:06.464
Now, you know everything.

54:09.798 --> 54:12.464
My origin story.

54:14.381 --> 54:18.005
I was sitting in this
exact spot almost...

54:18.089 --> 54:20.130
a hundred years ago.

54:20.589 --> 54:23.964
This was a silent movie house
before they built it back up.

54:25.506 --> 54:28.214
My mama played the piano
right over there.

54:30.172 --> 54:31.798
It burnt, too.

54:33.381 --> 54:36.881
Last thing I saw
before my world ended

54:36.964 --> 54:40.214
was Bass Reeves,
the Black Marshal of Oklahoma.

54:40.964 --> 54:44.422
Fifteen feet tall in flickering
black and white.

54:44.506 --> 54:46.881
"Trust in the law," he said.

54:47.339 --> 54:49.422
And I did.

54:49.839 --> 54:52.547
So, I took his name
after Tulsa burned.

54:54.047 --> 54:56.172
He was my hero.

54:57.422 --> 54:59.631
That's why I became a cop.

55:00.005 --> 55:02.422
Then, I realized,

55:02.506 --> 55:05.964
there was a reason
Bass Reeves hid his face.

55:06.047 --> 55:09.214
So, I hid mine, too.

55:12.422 --> 55:14.464
Hooded Justice.

55:14.547 --> 55:16.464
Will:
Mm. The hood.

55:16.547 --> 55:19.047
When I put it on,

55:19.714 --> 55:21.089
you felt what I felt?

55:22.172 --> 55:23.255
Anger.

55:23.339 --> 55:25.547
Yeah, that's what
I thought, too.

55:27.047 --> 55:29.214
But it wasn't.

55:31.089 --> 55:35.255
It was fear... and hurt.

55:40.214 --> 55:42.964
You can't heal
under a mask, Angela.

55:46.589 --> 55:48.964
Wounds need air.

55:50.964 --> 55:53.506
He wanted me to give him up.

55:53.589 --> 55:55.964
He told me you'd
try to save him,

55:56.047 --> 55:58.756
but this was the way
it had to be.

55:59.589 --> 56:03.214
You can't make an omelet
without breaking
a couple of eggs.

56:06.339 --> 56:08.798
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

56:08.881 --> 56:10.964
That's just something he said,

56:11.047 --> 56:13.422
when we met way back then.

56:13.506 --> 56:16.923
He said you would understand
when the time was right.

56:18.422 --> 56:20.589
(sighs) Well, I don't.

56:21.339 --> 56:22.422
(sighs)

56:22.506 --> 56:24.881
Then the time ain't right.

56:25.464 --> 56:27.339
(scoffs)

56:31.589 --> 56:32.673
(sighs)

56:33.798 --> 56:36.047
Where are you staying?

56:36.130 --> 56:40.172
A motel down the block.
If it's still there.

56:44.673 --> 56:46.839
We have a guest room.

56:48.631 --> 56:52.130
You can come home
and stay if you want.

56:52.214 --> 56:55.464
Just for a couple of nights.

56:58.130 --> 57:00.089
Just for a couple of nights.

57:09.673 --> 57:12.047
(wind blowing)

57:12.130 --> 57:14.631
Veidt:
She was buried in the ice.

57:14.714 --> 57:17.839
I had to tinker a bit
to get her up and running,

57:17.923 --> 57:21.881
but she should get you
back to civilization.

57:21.964 --> 57:23.547
(doors shut)

57:28.339 --> 57:30.005
(softly):
Archie.

57:30.089 --> 57:33.255
Now, it's my understanding
the police use Dreiberg's design

57:33.339 --> 57:35.089
for their own airships,

57:35.172 --> 57:37.005
so I assume you
know how to fly it?

57:37.089 --> 57:39.714
-Indeed, I do.
-Veidt: Well, then...

57:42.798 --> 57:44.422
It's been a hoot.

57:44.506 --> 57:47.589
-Blake: Are you coming with us.
-Excuse me?

57:47.673 --> 57:51.047
You killed three million people,
Adrian. You're under arrest.

57:51.547 --> 57:54.589
Ha! That's funny.

57:54.673 --> 57:56.089
You got me for a moment.

57:56.172 --> 57:57.547
I'm not joking.

57:57.631 --> 57:59.339
Oh, Laurie, please.

57:59.422 --> 58:02.172
-You have no proof.
-Wade: I do.

58:03.506 --> 58:05.631
This is your confession,

58:05.714 --> 58:08.923
explaining to Redford what
you did and how you did it.

58:09.005 --> 58:12.714
So, I suppose the FBI is gonna
arrest the president, too?

58:12.798 --> 58:14.756
Sure. Why not?

58:15.214 --> 58:18.089
Because the world...

58:18.172 --> 58:19.798
will end.

58:19.881 --> 58:21.673
(sighs) Yeah.

58:21.756 --> 58:25.172
People keep saying that,
but it never seems to happen.

58:26.297 --> 58:30.089
You kept this secret
all this time,

58:31.339 --> 58:34.214
and now,
you're having misgivings.

58:35.464 --> 58:37.631
People change, Adrian.

58:38.297 --> 58:40.631
At least, some of us do.

58:44.464 --> 58:47.422
Who do you think you are
to hold judgment over me, huh?

58:48.089 --> 58:50.673
I saved mankind.

58:50.756 --> 58:52.130
Again!

58:52.214 --> 58:54.673
And you have the audacity to--

58:54.756 --> 58:56.923
-(clangs)
-Ooh!

58:58.881 --> 59:01.047
That guy talks to much.

59:01.422 --> 59:02.839
He surely fucking does.

I'm sorry he's gone.

1:02:45.798 --> 1:02:49.339
But, uh... considering

what he could do...

1:02:53.506 --> 1:02:55.673
he could've done more.

Angela:
So, you could put
them in this egg,

1:04:18.089 --> 1:04:21.130
and if I ate it,
I could walk on water?
