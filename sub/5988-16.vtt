WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.601
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
Your generals. Who did this?

00:02.603 --> 00:04.136
It was the Red Knights.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.338
They left a calling card
in my chambers.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.474
I'm bringing the ships in for
maintenance at the end of month.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.476
I can have them back on the
North Sea in a week's time.

00:10.478 --> 00:11.643
I suppose a week is
a small price to pay

00:11.645 --> 00:13.245
to maintain our fleet.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.280
I received a message
this morning from Lola.

00:15.282 --> 00:17.149
Then I realized this was
not a letter to me,

00:17.151 --> 00:18.801
but a coded message for you.

00:18.802 --> 00:20.452
She's saying there's a week
when I can have safe passage

00:20.454 --> 00:22.254
across the North Sea.
I'm going home.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.056
BASH:<i> Before he died,</i>
<i> Francis asked me</i>

00:24.058 --> 00:26.725
<i> to give this to you</i>
<i> the day you left for Scotland.</i>

00:27.762 --> 00:29.261
You had my sister beaten

00:29.263 --> 00:31.063
so you could reclaim
the regency.

00:31.065 --> 00:33.298
You deceived and betrayed me.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.633
Claude, please...
Go to hell!

00:34.635 --> 00:35.768
You may be regent,

00:35.770 --> 00:37.536
but I am king,
and you will pay

00:37.538 --> 00:38.637
for what you've done.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.205
(panting, gasping)

00:40.775 --> 00:43.575
(screams)

00:47.348 --> 00:49.581
¶ ¶

00:56.390 --> 00:59.358
(indistinct conversations)

01:01.429 --> 01:03.395
¶ They all need ¶

01:03.397 --> 01:05.597
¶ Something to hold onto ¶

01:05.599 --> 01:06.532
¶ They all ¶

01:06.534 --> 01:09.601
¶ Mean well... ¶

01:09.603 --> 01:11.570
There's another one
alive here!

01:11.572 --> 01:14.573
¶ I will not fold ¶

01:14.575 --> 01:16.408
¶ She's in control ¶

01:16.410 --> 01:19.445
(coughing):
Help me.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.679
¶ I will not fold ¶

01:24.385 --> 01:26.085
(panting, gasping)

01:26.087 --> 01:28.320
¶ I will not fold ¶

01:28.322 --> 01:31.557
¶ She's in control ¶

01:31.559 --> 01:33.459
(panting, gasping)

01:33.461 --> 01:35.260
(muffled squealing)

01:35.262 --> 01:36.795
Keep quiet,

01:36.797 --> 01:38.597
or we're next.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.600
¶ ¶

01:41.602 --> 01:43.102
MAN: Put them all
to the sword.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.473
Where is Bash?
Did you see him on the beach?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.408
No.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.509
MAN: Look over there.

01:50.511 --> 01:51.810
How did you get ashore?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.580
Two crewmen and I clung
to the mast.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.582
We washed ashore
about 1000 strides from here.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.284
I found a dozen
or so mercenaries.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.487
When the pillagers arrived, they
chose to save their own lives.

02:01.489 --> 02:04.189
The few soldiers
I had left deserted.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.425
And I don't blame them.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.393
They're vulnerable and
unarmed on foreign soil.

02:08.395 --> 02:10.395
Foreign soil for them,

02:10.397 --> 02:13.265
for me it's home.
Scotland.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.536
Mary, we have to go.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.539
Found one more.

02:20.541 --> 02:21.907
Still breathing.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.375
MARY: It's Bash.
He's alive.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.409
We have to stop them.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.611
NARCISSE: Give me your sword.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.879
It's gone.

02:26.881 --> 02:27.913
Then we have no choice.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.449
Look away.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.153
(horses whinnying)

02:45.499 --> 02:48.534
They're taking him,
the Druids.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.504
What the hell kind of country
do you have here?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.306
We have to follow them.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.808
I couldn't save anyone else,
but I won't leave Bash behind.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.517
I brought my best chef
back from London.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.618
We'll sample his menu later.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.719
You're really going all out

03:07.721 --> 03:10.255
to impress
the prince of Denmark.

03:10.257 --> 03:13.425
Yes, our correspondence
has been warm, encouraging.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.360
And he knows
I'm seeking a husband.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.628
Denmark's quite
a small nation.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.631
Are you really considering
such a union?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.400
Sweet Lord, no.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.368
Denmark's main export is oxen.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.370
England suffered an outbreak

03:25.372 --> 03:26.538
of hoof-and-mouth disease
that nearly wiped out

03:26.540 --> 03:28.540
our livestock.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.976
We need beasts of burden to plow
our fields before the harvest,

03:30.978 --> 03:32.511
or we'll all starve.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.213
The romantic life of a queen.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.548
Don't you wish
you were still unwed?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.883
Speaking of,

03:37.885 --> 03:41.553
I didn't mention
you were married.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.255
Prince Magnus' companion
is also seeking a bride.

03:43.257 --> 03:46.525
But what's the harm
in a little flirting?

03:46.527 --> 03:48.560
Especially when you care
for your husband so little.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.630
I didn't say
I don't care for him.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.898
That's right,
the words you used were,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.533
"morally corrosive
and very sexy."

03:54.535 --> 03:56.301
(laughs)
Remember,

03:56.303 --> 03:58.670
be charming, even if
his friend is boring

03:58.672 --> 04:00.239
and hideous.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.308
What makes you think
he'll be either?

04:03.310 --> 04:06.011
So they shine in comparison,
royals often surround themselves

04:06.013 --> 04:08.013
with the less attractive.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.948
I don't mean you, Lola.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.684
GUARD: Your majesty,
the prince of Denmark.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.457
Your majesty.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.359
Prince Magnus.
Yes.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.995
May I present
Prince Magnus of Denmark.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.666
Oh.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.635
CLAUDE:
<i> Do you really think</i>

04:29.637 --> 04:30.669
you can bribe your way

04:30.671 --> 04:31.870
back into my good graces?

04:31.872 --> 04:33.639
You paid a man to marry me,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.641
and then assault me
on my wedding night.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.576
Claude, your ordeal
with Duke Bionel,

04:37.578 --> 04:39.678
it was abhorrent, but can't
you take comfort in knowing

04:39.680 --> 04:40.779
it was for the greater good?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.881
What good?
You becoming queen regent?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.016
Charles and I both know

04:44.018 --> 04:46.018
you tricked Lord Narcisse

04:46.020 --> 04:48.620
into accepting the duke's
proposal on my behalf,

04:48.622 --> 04:50.689
then had me beaten.
To discredit Narcisse,

04:50.691 --> 04:53.659
and have him removed as regent,
yes, I did that.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.527
You didn't just
have him removed,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.663
you manipulated Charles
into doing it for you.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.797
I will split hairs with you

04:58.799 --> 04:59.798
no longer.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.033
Narcisse had to go.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.468
You may loathe me in private,

05:03.470 --> 05:05.504
but you will keep
your disdain a secret.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.938
The Red Knights
would like nothing more

05:06.940 --> 05:08.940
than to see
this family fractured.

05:11.045 --> 05:13.912
And what exactly are your plans
to apprehend those knights?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.714
This is an enemy unlike
any we have faced.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.083
We don't know their numbers,
nor their leader.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.551
Only their agenda,

05:19.553 --> 05:22.421
which is to discredit
and destroy the Valois.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.323
My response is

05:24.325 --> 05:25.924
to quietly gather intelligence,
determine their next move,

05:25.926 --> 05:27.492
and catch them in the act.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.628
Sitting and waiting
is not a strategy.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.929
We need a plan of action.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.899
My plan will not
be questioned further.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.368
I'm the one in power,
and you will listen to me.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.636
You are hereby ordered

05:37.638 --> 05:39.071
to stay safely

05:39.073 --> 05:40.839
within the walls of this castle

05:40.841 --> 05:42.874
until the Red Knights
are brought to justice.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.945
Can't you just lock her up?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.347
Unfortunately, no.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.614
She deceived the king.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.717
We have Christophe's letter
as proof.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.685
We can show it
to the privy council.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.455
You told her there
would be consequences.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.091
One of which would be me
exposed as a gullible fool.

05:59.093 --> 06:01.426
I pressured the council
to remove Lord Narcisse

06:01.428 --> 06:04.529
as regent and install
Mother in his place.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.631
My nobles can't know
how she tricked me.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.600
It's maddening how
she constantly gets her way.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.802
Not for much longer.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.938
The moment I learned of Mother's
treachery, I hatched a plot

06:12.940 --> 06:14.840
that will not only
remove the queen regent,

06:14.842 --> 06:17.909
but get rid of the regency
all together,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.811
leaving me to rule on my own.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.446
By law, you can't
until you're of age.

06:21.448 --> 06:25.384
Privy council has the power to
declare me of age early,

06:25.386 --> 06:26.785
if I can prove, through merit,

06:26.787 --> 06:27.819
that I am fit.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.858
I plan to bring down
the Red Knights by myself.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.693
And when I do, the council
will have no choice

06:34.695 --> 06:37.429
but to see
me as a legitimate leader.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.170
The captain told me we would
land in Edinburgh around dawn.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.574
Considering the storm hit us
from behind and raged all night,

06:49.576 --> 06:52.110
I would say we've landed
somewhere north of there.

06:52.112 --> 06:55.447
It's isolated
and sparsely populated.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.416
If we run into any locals,
what are the chances

06:57.418 --> 06:58.617
that they'll be happy
to see you?

06:58.619 --> 07:02.154
MARY: In this region,
it would be an equal mix

07:02.156 --> 07:04.423
of Scots who support me,
and those that want me ousted.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.827
The only reason that
I'm on this godforsaken rock

07:08.829 --> 07:10.629
is to get to Lola in England.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.198
The only reason I am
with you, my constant foe,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.633
is to rescue Bash.

07:14.635 --> 07:15.834
I read about these people, look.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.869
That is a wicker man.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.538
They burn people inside it

07:19.540 --> 07:21.173
as human sacrifice.
That's not true.

07:21.175 --> 07:23.508
My Scottish nannies told me
that they are a peaceful

07:23.510 --> 07:24.943
and misunderstood people.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.479
You think you know your
country and your subjects,

07:27.481 --> 07:29.514
but you don't.

07:29.516 --> 07:30.615
This is a broken land.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.883
It's devastated

07:31.885 --> 07:33.518
and ripped apart
by England and France.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.053
You saw what happened
on the beach.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.656
They kill foreigners,
they don't reason with them.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.491
I am not a foreigner,
I am a Scot.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.059
Raised in French court.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.061
Scotland may have
been on your mind

07:43.063 --> 07:45.130
all these years,
but it's not in your soul.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.032
It's like that
scabbard you carry,

07:47.034 --> 07:48.967
you may wish it held the blade
that Francis made for you,

07:48.969 --> 07:51.536
but it is still empty.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.605
(thunder rumbling)

07:55.809 --> 07:58.844
I understand that you hate me
for driving a wedge

07:58.846 --> 08:00.579
between you and your wife...

08:00.581 --> 08:02.647
One brick in a very long wall.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.549
But I didn't have to
bring you with me.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.084
You promised protection

08:06.086 --> 08:08.954
and tactical knowledge
on this journey, so provide it!

08:08.956 --> 08:11.056
Save Bash and then we will
go our separate ways,

08:11.058 --> 08:13.692
you to England
to return Lola home,

08:13.694 --> 08:14.926
and me to Edinburgh,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.928
to meet my regent
and half-brother James,

08:16.930 --> 08:19.998
who will restore me
as Scotland's queen.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.936
Well, if the locals in
these parts are hostile to you,

08:24.938 --> 08:26.938
it is better that
your identity remain secret.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.575
From the shipwreck, I took
papers from the bodies

08:30.577 --> 08:32.277
of your chambermaid
and her brother.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.979
So, congratulations,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.981
we're siblings.

08:35.983 --> 08:38.884
(dog barks)

08:40.554 --> 08:42.587
MARY:
They're going hunting.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.623
We should go now.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.924
If they are unfriendly,

08:45.925 --> 08:47.224
at least their numbers
will be diminished.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.796
I see most of your
rooms face south.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.632
To embrace the light.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.835
In Denmark, in the summertime,
the sun never sets.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.703
Isn't it quite dark
this time of year?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.539
A minor concession.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.541
There's so much wonderful
literature and theater,

09:02.543 --> 09:03.575
we barely notice.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.943
Yes, you mentioned that.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.546
Oh, and if you
tasted our cuisine,

09:07.548 --> 09:10.015
you'd never eat bland
English food again.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.851
Have you considered
hiring a Danish chef?

09:12.853 --> 09:14.719
Oh, no,
what would be the point?

09:14.721 --> 09:18.056
You could never achieve
the same richness of flavor,

09:18.058 --> 09:21.026
not with fish caught
in your part of the sea.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.595
You think our part
of the sea is worse?

09:23.597 --> 09:26.631
It might be why your air
has a certain odor.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.300
(sniffs) It lingers.

09:28.302 --> 09:29.901
In Demark the air is...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.304
Superior? Am I right?

09:32.306 --> 09:34.606
You are, you are indeed.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
You don't miss French court?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.642
I do,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.912
but it's rather fascinating
getting to know another queen.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.614
So you're like
an informal emissary.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.749
How intriguing.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.052
But even more intriguing is how
a woman as lovely as you

09:47.054 --> 09:48.620
has yet to wed.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.624
Uh, actually, I have wed.

09:52.626 --> 09:56.061
I had a husband, but he...

09:56.063 --> 09:58.797
There was a fire,
and he was gone.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.100
I'm so sorry.
Any children?

10:02.102 --> 10:04.102
A son. He's here,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.237
under the supervision
of a very kind nanny

10:06.239 --> 10:07.906
thanks to
Elizabeth's generosity.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.941
So you're free to spend
your day with me?

10:09.943 --> 10:11.643
Absolutely.
Wonderful.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.778
As is this castle, Your Majesty.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.647
Eh, if only they
could re-orient it

10:15.649 --> 10:18.850
so the landscape
looked less... flat.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.186
In Denmark...
Please.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.754
I... (clears throat)

10:22.756 --> 10:25.790
meant I would like
to show you something.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.059
(sighs)

10:33.200 --> 10:35.934
(whispering):
Prince Magnus.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.003
(scoffs)
Why it sounds as though

10:38.005 --> 10:39.270
you are standing
right beside me.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.806
Welcome to the Whisper Gallery.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.008
LOLA:
It's an architectural feat.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.209
The acoustics are designed

10:44.211 --> 10:45.677
to carry one's voice
a great distance,

10:45.679 --> 10:47.145
but if you were to stand
over there,

10:47.147 --> 10:49.114
you'd hardly hear her.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.849
How magical.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.785
My father designed it so he
could secretly woo women,

10:53.787 --> 10:56.755
even as he stood next
to their husbands.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.289
But the surprises
don't end here.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.959
Come.
I got you something.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.794
MAGNUS:
As we arrived,

11:02.796 --> 11:05.030
we saw nothing but the
dullest greens and browns.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.264
When did it snow?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.767
It didn't, I had it
brought in for you.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.735
And your favorite winter game:

11:10.737 --> 11:12.404
Fange Flage.
I love it!

11:12.406 --> 11:17.442
Keep it up, I might even give
you a deal on those oxen.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.980
(Bash coughing)

11:21.982 --> 11:23.448
DRUID:
Tesei trin druh

11:23.450 --> 11:25.383
<i> fram bre swaq ped.</i>

11:25.385 --> 11:27.285
<i> Tesei trin druh</i>

11:27.287 --> 11:28.987
<i> fram bre swaq ped.</i>

11:28.989 --> 11:30.922
<i>Du ghoil breen truv kol.</i>

11:30.924 --> 11:32.824
(Bash gasping)

11:32.826 --> 11:34.059
<i> Du ghoil breen truv kol.</i>

11:34.061 --> 11:38.296
<i>Treh gom knowl,</i>
<i>treh gom knowl.</i>

11:38.298 --> 11:40.065
<i> Seq druven begnan si.</i>

11:40.067 --> 11:41.399
NARCISSE: Stop!
MARY: Those snakes poisonous?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.300
He'll die.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.402
Unhand our friend, you savage.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.437
Stand your ground.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.471
He has drawn Sea Breathe.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.190
It will kill him,

11:48.191 --> 11:49.908
but this ritual could help.
If he is fated to live,

11:49.910 --> 11:51.976
the snakes will not strike.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.979
(labored breathing)

11:58.285 --> 12:00.085
(hissing)

12:02.756 --> 12:04.255
The Druid's Egg,

12:04.257 --> 12:06.758
secreted by the serpents
and marked by their tongues,

12:06.760 --> 12:09.260
restores all.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.162
(labored breathing continues)

12:15.902 --> 12:17.869
(coughs)

12:17.871 --> 12:20.939
(gasping, coughing)

12:20.941 --> 12:22.440
He will survive.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.245
My newly created spy network,
"The Phantom Brigade,"

12:27.247 --> 12:29.147
is an exclusive group.
I chose you,

12:29.149 --> 12:30.415
not just because
of our years of friendship,

12:30.417 --> 12:32.117
but because
you come from France's

12:32.119 --> 12:33.218
most influential families.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.803
Through your connections,

12:34.804 --> 12:36.387
we will root out this nation's
most insidious enemy.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.889
She's coming.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.297
Oh, God, that vase

12:46.299 --> 12:48.266
was a gift for my 18th birthday

12:48.268 --> 12:49.501
from Pope Paul III.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.104
It's fine.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.073
I always hated
the hideous thing.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.475
You boys have fun.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.816
Your mother's in a rare mood.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.084
She wants me to like her again.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.469
DANIEL:
I'm still confused.

13:07.470 --> 13:08.853
Why are we playing battledore
and shuttlecock in public

13:08.855 --> 13:10.255
if our meetings
are supposed to be secret?

13:10.257 --> 13:12.290
Our meetings are secret,

13:12.292 --> 13:13.925
but when the queen regent
sees us together,

13:13.927 --> 13:16.327
I want her to think I'm
entertaining feckless youths,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.897
not my agents of espionage.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.331
Which brings us back
to our mission.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.367
Now, tell me,
who has dug up information

13:22.369 --> 13:25.003
on the Red Knights?

13:25.005 --> 13:27.372
No one has anything?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.908
Well, keep at it.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.843
Let me know as soon
as there's news.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.144
Now let's eat.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.851
You have something to share,
don't you Felix?

13:39.853 --> 13:41.252
It's likely nothing,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.354
but I didn't want to mention it
in front of the others

13:43.356 --> 13:46.024
to avoid ridicule.

13:48.228 --> 13:51.029
(whispering)

13:51.031 --> 13:52.130
(scoffs)
That's not nothing.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.531
That may just be
the information I need

13:53.533 --> 13:55.099
to vanquish the Red Knights

13:55.101 --> 13:57.268
and force my mother
from the throne.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.110
The goal is to capture
the other nation's flag

14:06.112 --> 14:07.478
from atop its fort.
If you are tagged,

14:07.480 --> 14:09.948
you must freeze...

14:09.950 --> 14:12.083
until one of
your teammates tags you.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.251
Shall we play with snowballs

14:13.253 --> 14:14.385
counting the same as a touch?

14:14.387 --> 14:16.154
Why not?
What fun.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.156
Oh yes, we Danes used to raid

14:18.158 --> 14:19.524
your country
all the time, you know.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.560
At one point we'd even taken
over your people completely.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.429
That was 600 years ago.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.098
The glory days
of the Vikings are over.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.399
We shall see.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.437
Elizabeth,

14:32.439 --> 14:35.173
men in general like to win.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.507
Prince Magnus seems
a very proud man.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.577
Denmark has things
that England needs.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.079
Plus, you want him

14:41.081 --> 14:42.580
to want to marry you, don't you?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.482
So let him win.

14:44.484 --> 14:48.386
¶ There's no right
or wrong way to go ¶

14:48.388 --> 14:50.355
(all laughing playfully)

14:50.357 --> 14:51.389
¶ 'Cause you never know ¶

14:51.391 --> 14:54.025
¶ You never know ¶

14:54.027 --> 14:56.494
¶ It's better to say yes or no ¶

14:56.496 --> 14:58.930
¶ 'Cause you never know ¶

14:58.932 --> 15:01.599
¶ You never know ¶

15:01.601 --> 15:05.303
(both grunting,
giggling)

15:05.305 --> 15:08.506
¶ Oh, oh, oh ¶

15:08.508 --> 15:09.440
(Elizabeth giggling)

15:09.442 --> 15:11.643
(grunts)

15:11.645 --> 15:12.410
(laughs)

15:12.412 --> 15:13.444
(scoffs)

15:13.446 --> 15:14.612
(grunts)

15:14.614 --> 15:15.647
(laughs)

15:15.649 --> 15:18.349
I was frozen!
You hit me already.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.318
Denmark is the best!
(laughs)

15:20.320 --> 15:21.486
Denmark is the best!

15:21.488 --> 15:24.289
Oh, yes!
(laughs)

15:24.291 --> 15:25.189
I've done it!
I've won.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.591
Denmark is the best.
Hello.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.393
(groans)
Denmark is the best.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.397
Weapons are being secretly
amassed in Orsay.

15:32.399 --> 15:33.498
My spy told me.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.133
You have a spy?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.534
Several, actually.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.671
I took a page out
of Mother's book.

15:39.673 --> 15:43.174
She has courtesans gathering
information for her.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.476
I've recruited my highborn
friends to do the same for me.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.980
Daniel's father is a general
in the elite gendarmerie.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.316
Thierry's is a rector
at the University of Paris.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.483
I've heard universities
can be hotbeds

15:52.485 --> 15:54.085
of anti-monarchist movements.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.321
Did Thierry tell you
of the munitions stockpile?

15:56.323 --> 15:57.689
No, that was Felix,

15:57.691 --> 16:00.325
the son of Duke Jean-Dubois,
whose duchy includes...

16:00.327 --> 16:01.426
The Port of La Rochelle?

16:01.428 --> 16:02.727
Precisely.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.429
Felix went to his
father's office

16:04.431 --> 16:06.264
and snuck a look through
the shipping logs.

16:06.266 --> 16:09.233
He noticed crates of weapons
being moved through the port,

16:09.235 --> 16:10.368
then on to Orsay.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.337
And what's so odd about that?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.072
Orsay is a farming town.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.240
They don't need those armaments.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.443
What if the Red Knights
are headquartered there?

16:18.445 --> 16:21.179
It's a hunch worth looking into
and I plan on doing it myself.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.513
It's too risky.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.253
Claude, I must take personal
credit for this triumph.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.622
But you're hated in Orsay.
The last time you were there,

16:31.624 --> 16:34.492
the villagers pelted your
carriage with rocks and rubbish.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.295
Narcisse imposed a tax
on them and I was blamed.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.529
Regardless,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.365
I am going.
I just need protection.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.433
The only problem is
the Red Knights

16:42.435 --> 16:43.468
have infiltrated
the kingsguard.

16:43.470 --> 16:44.769
I don't know who I can trust.

16:44.771 --> 16:48.439
In the kingsguard? I do.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.575
It's the man I'm going to marry.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.777
(giggling)
Hello.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.479
Are we dancing?

16:54.481 --> 16:56.481
Tonight and forever, my darling.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.483
I told you I'd use
my connections

16:58.485 --> 17:00.018
to help you rise in station.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.353
And I did. You are now working

17:02.355 --> 17:03.721
as the right-hand man
to the king.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.556
Together you'll expose
the Red Knights,

17:05.558 --> 17:07.458
and topple the regent.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.559
Our regent?

17:08.561 --> 17:10.428
Your mother,
Catherine de Medici?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.497
No.
Yes.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.265
And once my brother is declared
sole ruler of France,

17:14.267 --> 17:15.433
he has promised to
make you a duke,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.602
the highest title
in French nobility.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.303
High enough to marry me.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.705
(glasses clink)

17:20.707 --> 17:23.741
Oh, dear, but this,
Charles' idea, it's, it's...

17:23.743 --> 17:26.277
Difficult? Daring?

17:26.279 --> 17:27.512
Dangerous?

17:27.514 --> 17:29.280
Of course it is.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.316
But Charles is smart,
and you are brilliant.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.085
No more brilliant
than Catherine.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.754
I don't know who to fear more,
the Red Knights or her.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.556
My mother's a genius,

17:38.558 --> 17:43.428
but she's also selfish, corrupt,
and not worthy to rule.

17:43.430 --> 17:46.531
Charles is like Francis.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.133
Fair and kind.
He represents

17:49.135 --> 17:50.435
the France of tomorrow.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.536
The France you and I
will flourish in.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.571
You speak of
the fates of royals.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.573
My life doesn't merit
being lumped in with theirs.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.175
It does.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.144
You are a good man,
deserving of this opportunity.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.714
All right.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.550
I will report
to Charles at once.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.256
Booked passage with mercenaries?

18:14.561 --> 18:15.626
It's all we could afford.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.095
We're from this...

18:17.097 --> 18:18.729
humble town near Paris,

18:18.731 --> 18:20.364
where the money
was running low.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.868
Found a rich Scot to
marry my sister Pauline.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.837
We were heading to, um...

18:25.839 --> 18:27.672
Falkirk.

18:28.675 --> 18:29.924
Near Edinburgh.

18:29.925 --> 18:31.174
After the shipwreck,
we followed you

18:31.177 --> 18:33.211
to ensure Bash's safety.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.645
He is a loyal servant
of ours.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.115
Thank you
for your hospitality, Senneck.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.684
It's a virtue we adhere to.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.519
Along with honor, loyalty,

18:41.521 --> 18:43.721
justice.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.556
Then how do you explain
the wicker man?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.525
Pierre.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.660
He's not the first
to think we're savages.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.863
Most of our countrymen
fear and hate us.

18:51.865 --> 18:54.565
We're not nomads by choice,
we're driven to be so.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.902
When we first came upon
this oak grove,

18:57.904 --> 18:59.904
there was mistletoe
clinging to the branches.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.606
The sign of a sacred place.

19:01.608 --> 19:02.740
So we made camp

19:02.742 --> 19:04.642
and built the effigy.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.545
For protection,
not human sacrifice.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.482
If it keeps us from harm,
we'll burn it

19:11.484 --> 19:13.184
to thank the gods.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.353
Hopefully, we're safe
until spring.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.754
Who's there to
threaten you out here?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.789
There's not a village
for miles.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.625
The Wulvers are
always in pursuit.

19:20.627 --> 19:21.926
They live by

19:21.928 --> 19:23.361
feeding off others.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.730
They pillaged your ship.
Murdered the survivors.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.331
These Wulvers, that's not
a clan name, is it?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.267
It's our term for them.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.202
Named after a beast
that's half-man, half-wolf.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.737
They're our most deadly foe.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.240
Surely Scotland's ruler can help
you with your plight.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.408
Have you taken this
affair to the regent?

19:37.410 --> 19:39.510
We want nothing to do
with politics.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.346
It's never aided us before.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.181
The Wulvers are anti-government
revolutionaries.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.715
They detest the current regime.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.484
You'll soon marry
into this country

19:46.486 --> 19:48.219
and learn that it's
a fractured place of hate

19:48.221 --> 19:49.887
and distrust.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.857
Maybe if a
great unifier appeared.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.926
A leader we could all
put our faith in.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.429
But who is up to that task?

19:58.431 --> 20:00.665
I don't know.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.635
(birds cooing)

20:04.637 --> 20:06.771
Let's get started.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.240
We still have two barns
to search down the road.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.341
Orsay doesn't have
many buildings

20:10.343 --> 20:11.742
large enough to house

20:11.744 --> 20:12.843
the number of weapons
we're looking for.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.779
We're running low on options.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.713
Have hope, Your Majesty.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.588
Gun powder.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.722
There's loads of it.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.763
Whoever stockpiled this
could start a war.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.837
The Red Knights' emblem.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.772
I have a plan,

20:41.774 --> 20:43.908
but it will require
additional men who can fight.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.376
Back at the castle,

20:45.378 --> 20:46.644
I can handpick a team
of kingsguards.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.613
Ones that I can
personally vouch for.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.715
Perfect, then we return here

20:50.717 --> 20:53.317
and use this gunpowder to blow
this silo to the heavens.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.386
The explosion will
draw out the Red Knights.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.887
They'll come running to save
what's left of their weapons

20:56.889 --> 20:59.390
and when they do...
We'll be waiting.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.492
It's going to be
a stunning victory.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.527
One the privy council
can't ignore.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.997
Long live King Charles.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.339
Will you be visiting

21:15.341 --> 21:17.875
Elizabeth's palace
in London as well?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.543
I'm afraid we're heading back
to Denmark tomorrow,

21:19.545 --> 21:21.946
which is why I'm keen to spend
every remaining moment with you.

21:21.948 --> 21:22.947
I'm quite smitten.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.515
I get the sense,

21:24.517 --> 21:25.816
though you are widowed,

21:25.818 --> 21:26.784
that you're not
necessarily interested

21:26.786 --> 21:28.319
in marriage, am I right?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.521
Uh, you are, I'm afraid.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.723
Then forgive me for being
so bold as to ask,

21:32.725 --> 21:35.359
would you be interested
in anything else?

21:35.361 --> 21:37.762
In my chambers tonight,
for example.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.829
(chuckles)

21:38.831 --> 21:40.665
There's the smile
I was hoping for.

21:40.667 --> 21:41.966
I didn't say yes.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.401
Allow me to charm you some more

21:43.403 --> 21:44.802
and we'll work on
that next part.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.971
We'll talk of livestock
soon enough.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.541
Now, the thing you'll love
about the Baltic Sea...

21:50.543 --> 21:52.910
If we could stay on topic of
trade for just a moment more.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.346
The oxen are yours, Elizabeth.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.714
(sighs)
Draft your statement

21:56.716 --> 22:00.051
thanking Denmark for saving
England from famine-- no,

22:00.053 --> 22:01.952
ruin--
and you'll have your deal.

22:01.954 --> 22:05.456
Saving England?

22:05.458 --> 22:06.791
This is hardly charity,

22:06.793 --> 22:08.859
you're charging us a fortune
for those bovines.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.661
They are magnificent animals.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.096
Better than you ever had here.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.965
And, I'm sorry, I must insist
on the public statement.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.635
You can help us spread
the news of Denmark's glory.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.804
You'll feel the same way.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.672
You'll love Copenhagen.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.743
You think I'll abandon my
country and move to Denmark?

22:25.745 --> 22:27.778
(gulps) Oh, no, I was thinking
of it more as,

22:27.780 --> 22:29.013
"Even Elizabeth,

22:29.015 --> 22:32.950
ruler of England,
chose Denmark."

22:32.952 --> 22:36.454
(clears throat)
Excuse me, please.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.622
(sighs)

22:38.624 --> 22:40.124
Elizabeth.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.360
<i> I</i> am saving England
from famine,

22:42.362 --> 22:45.129
<i> I</i> am the more important
play on the world stage.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.931
Do the Danes brainwash
their royals,

22:46.933 --> 22:48.566
or are they too sheltered
to recognize

22:48.568 --> 22:50.701
how puny and
insignificant they are?

22:50.703 --> 22:51.769
England should invade Denmark.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.004
It would take barely any effort

22:54.006 --> 22:55.539
to crush their people
and their arrogance.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.941
(clears throat)

23:01.848 --> 23:03.013
Magnus, I...

23:03.015 --> 23:05.916
Did you just declare war
on my nation?

23:05.918 --> 23:07.952
I think you misheard.
I know what I heard,

23:07.954 --> 23:10.388
thanks to your father's
Whisper Gallery.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.423
Now you hear this.

23:12.425 --> 23:15.793
You can kiss your oxen
and me good-bye.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.897
(huffs) We are leaving. Now.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.400
You mustn't go.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.668
Seeing how upset you were
when you left the table,

23:24.670 --> 23:25.970
I came to apologize.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.838
I may have bragged a bit
about my country,

23:27.840 --> 23:31.609
but that's only because you
and England have a reputation

23:31.611 --> 23:33.911
for believing no other
nation or ruler compares.

23:33.913 --> 23:37.848
You're reacting to words
said in frustration, words...

23:37.850 --> 23:40.484
Words Queen Elizabeth
didn't even say.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.919
It was me, I said it.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.487
I felt you were
insulting the queen,

23:43.489 --> 23:45.623
my host and my dear friend.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.825
There will be consequences.

23:47.827 --> 23:48.759
Grave consequences.

23:48.761 --> 23:49.994
I'm sorry to do this,

23:49.996 --> 23:51.429
I truly am.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.697
You are hereby

23:53.699 --> 23:55.533
banned from Denmark.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.035
For life.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.043
It's a fate worse
than death apparently.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.012
Oh.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.181
I've come to tell you that
Bash's condition has improved.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.016
He'll be on his feet
by tomorrow.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.952
You're packing?

24:14.954 --> 24:17.021
Were you planning
to say good-bye,

24:17.023 --> 24:18.689
or were you just going
to scurry off like a rat

24:18.691 --> 24:20.691
with a mouth full of cheese?

24:20.693 --> 24:23.694
I made it abundantly clear
my only goal is to find Lola.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.596
And lest you continue

24:25.598 --> 24:27.565
to think of me as rodent-like,

24:27.567 --> 24:29.900
I checked with Senneck on
Bash's progress earlier

24:29.902 --> 24:33.037
to make sure you had someone
by your side before I left.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.206
So, you don't
need me any longer.
I do.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.774
You were right.

24:36.776 --> 24:38.776
I don't know this land,
I don't know these people.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.078
And, while I've been trying
to appear confident,

24:41.080 --> 24:44.915
what if I'm not fit to reign
over Scotland?

24:44.917 --> 24:48.052
If you're worried
about the Wulvers

24:48.054 --> 24:50.654
and the Druids, some rogue clan

24:50.656 --> 24:52.656
and a bizarre tribe in white,

24:52.658 --> 24:54.124
are not your country.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.827
No, they are one brick

24:56.829 --> 24:58.662
in a very long wall.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.731
What about the Protestants
and Catholics?

25:00.733 --> 25:03.701
What about me and John Knox,
a religious zealot

25:03.703 --> 25:06.003
who despises
female monarchs?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.805
Accompany me to Edinburgh.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.139
When I am on the throne,

25:09.141 --> 25:12.910
I promise I will obtain
Lola's release.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.646
Please!

25:15.648 --> 25:18.048
I cannot help you be queen!

25:18.050 --> 25:20.551
Or Scottish.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.653
Time and again, you have shown
an uncanny ability

25:22.655 --> 25:25.523
to emerge from adversity
unscathed and on top.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.057
You did it in France--

25:27.059 --> 25:30.194
much to my great annoyance--
and you will do it here.

25:35.167 --> 25:39.537
I can spend no more time
on your journey, I have my own.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.773
You care for Lola.

25:42.775 --> 25:43.908
I see that.

25:46.245 --> 25:50.080
Give the identification papers I
was using to Bash.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.282
He's your brother now.

25:53.085 --> 25:55.152
Good-bye, Mary.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.565
My team of
trusted Guards is ready.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.599
We'll meet them in the woods
beyond the village

26:08.601 --> 26:09.733
and then head to Orsay.

26:09.735 --> 26:10.801
Ah.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.303
My escape team.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.572
The secret passageways
are clear.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.073
There's a humble horse
and carriage waiting below
as you requested.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.710
Your Majesty, may I have a word?

26:19.712 --> 26:23.013
I've been thinking,
and it would be most prudent

26:23.015 --> 26:24.582
if...

26:24.584 --> 26:26.250
we completed the mission
while you stayed here.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.468
What?

26:27.469 --> 26:28.685
But Charles has to be there

26:28.688 --> 26:30.588
in order to be credited
for the win.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.723
We will make it abundantly
clear, especially to the nobles,

26:32.725 --> 26:34.592
who is responsible.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.193
Claude, I took a vow

26:36.195 --> 26:37.361
to protect the king's life.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.596
I ask you to consider
another vow.

26:38.598 --> 26:39.697
That of marriage.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.799
Do you wish to wed
my sister or not?

26:44.937 --> 26:47.805
Please do not die, Your Majesty.

26:47.807 --> 26:51.175
The only death dealt today
will be to the Red Knights.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.777
Our mission is to blow up

26:53.779 --> 26:55.713
their munitions stockpile
in Orsay.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.147
I'm going to someone
to run ahead,

26:57.149 --> 26:59.216
scout the target and
make sure no one's there.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.317
I'll go.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.686
I'm the fastest rider.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.288
I'll also need a decoy in my bed

27:04.290 --> 27:06.290
pretending to sleep off
a hangover.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.625
Got it.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.159
Felix, you and I
will rendezvous

27:09.161 --> 27:10.361
with Leith and travel
with him.

27:11.664 --> 27:12.696
Godspeed, brother.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.833
Charles will be fine.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.801
There's something more
on my mind.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.405
Have you ever wanted
something so much

27:21.407 --> 27:23.641
that the fear of not getting it
makes you wonder

27:23.643 --> 27:25.643
if you ever should've
wanted it at all?

27:25.645 --> 27:27.845
It's how I feel about you.

27:27.847 --> 27:32.383
Something we both want so deeply
warrants a bit of fear,

27:32.385 --> 27:34.318
because I don't want
to live without you.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
And after this, I won't have to.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.422
No one will ever
keep us apart again.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.694
(door opens)

27:43.696 --> 27:44.962
Lola.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.365
Something occurred to me.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.734
How ludicrous
my Danish punishment is?

27:52.805 --> 27:55.873
You were awfully quick to take
the blame for my harsh words.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.708
Well, you were awfully quick
to benefit from it.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.943
I'm serious.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.211
Why did you do it?

28:01.213 --> 28:03.781
I suppose I wasn't thinking.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.417
I'm not sure I believe that.

28:06.419 --> 28:10.821
I think back on your kindnesses.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.690
Ways in which you
extended yourself to me

28:12.692 --> 28:16.360
through words and council
designed to help me

28:16.362 --> 28:18.862
and to get me to like you.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.464
Why is that so odd?

28:20.466 --> 28:25.202
No, it is wise to be kind
to your captor,

28:25.204 --> 28:26.870
but I think you took a risk,

28:26.872 --> 28:28.372
hoping I would
take risks around you.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.475
Maybe tell you something
I wouldn't otherwise.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.945
Information you could
share with Mary.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.316
I have shared no information
with Mary.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.151
I don't have
any information<i> to</i> share.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.020
I've been here for months,

28:43.022 --> 28:44.288
and in your company enough

28:44.290 --> 28:46.490
to see how complicated
your position is.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.892
My position on Mary,
your friend,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.360
is simple.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.130
I'm a threat to her life
and your nation.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.399
Because England
and Scotland share borders.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.202
Because radical Protestants
and Catholics hate each other.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.471
Because the blood
in your veins divides people

29:00.473 --> 29:03.107
into camps, encouraging
battle for a single throne.

29:03.109 --> 29:05.743
You're a good person.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.845
And so is she.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.748
Both in untenable situations.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.151
I feel Mary's is worse.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.787
Scotland is now Protestant.

29:16.789 --> 29:18.922
What will she do?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.958
She can't stay
in France permanently.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.092
Well, why not?

29:22.094 --> 29:24.061
She's loved
by the French people,

29:24.063 --> 29:26.230
hated by so many of her own.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.098
I can't see
her rushing back to a country

29:28.100 --> 29:29.500
she's never really known.

29:29.502 --> 29:31.802
Not without a strong ally
to help her

29:31.804 --> 29:34.338
take her nation in hand.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.273
So you're saying
you think she'll wait

29:36.275 --> 29:38.809
for a powerful Catholic king
to be by her side.

29:40.513 --> 29:42.212
That she won't return
until she's wed.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.914
I don't know.

29:43.916 --> 29:47.084
But I do wish that
you could see Mary

29:47.086 --> 29:48.852
as something other
than an evil foe.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.255
And believe that I might
actually be a friend.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.193
I will try.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.364
That's what you said
about Magnus of Denmark.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.999
You didn't manage it.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.002
Well, I didn't take him out
with a snowball.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.304
That's progress, isn't it?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.145
Once I'm settled, I assure you,

30:15.147 --> 30:17.581
I will repay you
for these horses three-fold.

30:17.583 --> 30:19.416
I'm certain you'll make good
on that promise,

30:19.418 --> 30:21.151
Mary, Queen of Scots.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.355
I know I speak the truth.

30:25.357 --> 30:29.326
How? Have you seen my portrait?

30:29.328 --> 30:31.929
No one in this region has been
to Edinburgh Castle,

30:31.931 --> 30:34.231
let alone the portrait gallery.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.934
Rest assured, your identity
is a secret here.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.502
And one I intend to keep.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.937
I don't understand how you knew.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.305
I didn't at first.

30:41.307 --> 30:44.074
The tales of our far-off queen
have been told so long.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.209
I pictured you older,

30:45.211 --> 30:48.545
but here you are, so young.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.048
The fact that you might be
Scotland's monarch

30:51.050 --> 30:53.050
washed ashore wasn't
even a possibility,

30:53.052 --> 30:54.418
until I looked in your eyes.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.119
And what did you see?

30:56.121 --> 30:58.121
The human soul is immortal.

30:58.123 --> 31:00.357
When we die,
we live again in another.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.260
Inside you, I recognize
your father, King James,

31:03.262 --> 31:04.294
and his father before him.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.563
Do not fear what is to come.

31:06.565 --> 31:09.166
All you need to bring
this country together

31:09.168 --> 31:11.268
you already possess.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.303
The spirit of Scotland

31:13.305 --> 31:15.973
is in every beating
of your heart.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.441
Welcome home, Your Majesty.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.344
Your kindness
will not be forgotten.

31:20.346 --> 31:23.013
BASH: They've given us
more supplies

31:23.015 --> 31:25.315
than we can carry.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.184
Thank you, Senneck.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.252
I owe you my life.

31:28.254 --> 31:30.187
I know you don't
subscribe to our ways,

31:30.189 --> 31:32.422
but everyone can use
a blessing for the road.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.391
We'd be honored to have yours.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.928
Grant, oh, gods, thy protection.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.196
and in protection, reason.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.898
And in reason, light.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.366
And in light, truth.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.167
(horse whinnying)

31:44.169 --> 31:45.569
(choking)
It's the clansmen.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.670
If they see you,
they'll kill you.

31:46.672 --> 31:47.471
I can fight.

31:47.473 --> 31:49.206
You're still too weak.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.308
In here, quickly.

31:51.310 --> 31:53.410
(men yelling)

31:57.082 --> 31:58.916
(swords clashing, men grunting)

32:10.596 --> 32:11.695
(groans)

32:13.098 --> 32:15.933
(yells)

32:15.935 --> 32:18.235
(groans)

32:19.438 --> 32:20.671
We can't escape.
They've surrounded the camp.

32:20.673 --> 32:22.406
We have to hide
and I know where.

32:22.408 --> 32:24.141
What are those for?
You heard Senneck,

32:24.143 --> 32:26.143
If the Wulvers find us,
we won't have a chance.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.011
Unless we can get them
to take mercy on us.

32:28.013 --> 32:29.346
These could help.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.489
Can you heal that, Healer?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.028
See anyone else alive, boys?

33:02.147 --> 33:03.931
Who are you?

33:03.932 --> 33:05.716
I'm Pierre.
This is my sister, Pauline.

33:05.718 --> 33:08.151
We were sailing here
from France when our ship sank.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.287
And the men in white caught us.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.222
They were going
to burn us alive at sundown.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.690
Thank God you saved us
from those heathens.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.492
Indeed.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.494
A pretty lass like yourself
should be loved,

33:17.496 --> 33:19.196
not sacrificed.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.066
Are you war with the Druids?

33:23.068 --> 33:24.167
War? No.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.003
Just clearing our lands
of garbage.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.671
They've plundered our hunting
grounds and our fields.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.473
They're a threat.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.641
As you might assume we are,
if you survived that shipwreck.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.777
You saw men like me kill your
fellow travelers, didn't you?

33:33.779 --> 33:36.013
I wasn't there,

33:36.015 --> 33:37.280
but I was told the injuries
your companions suffered.

33:37.282 --> 33:39.032
It was beyond hope.

33:39.033 --> 33:40.783
They have a saying here,
"Dead men are free men."

33:40.786 --> 33:44.121
For us, it was an act of mercy,
not murder.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.255
We understand.

33:45.257 --> 33:46.790
Now, with your consent,

33:46.792 --> 33:48.725
My sister and I
must go to Falkirk.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.193
We're on our way to meet

33:50.194 --> 33:51.660
her husband-to-be
for the first time.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.130
We're heading that way,
you'll travel with our caravan.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.065
Oh, no, we can't trouble you.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.434
Would you like to die?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.668
Clearly, you're new to Scotland

33:58.670 --> 34:00.887
or you'd know that these roads
are treacherous.

34:00.888 --> 34:03.105
Bands of filthy Druids
still lurking about.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.408
But you're safe with us.

34:06.345 --> 34:07.577
I think his generosity
is an act.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.446
He must have some use for us.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.182
Yes, as hostages.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.355
Lady Lola.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.091
You look uneasy.

34:21.093 --> 34:22.626
Just surprised, that's all.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.561
Have the Danes gone?

34:24.563 --> 34:28.465
Gone, just as others arrived
on this island's shores.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.534
Survivors from
a French merchant ship

34:30.536 --> 34:32.202
that sank off
the coast of Scotland.

34:32.204 --> 34:36.573
The captain
of Magnus' Danish ship told me.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.476
What is odd is that
no cargo washed ashore.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.780
The bodies that did, however,
were loaded with weapons.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.316
They weren't sailors,

34:46.318 --> 34:48.452
they were soldiers.

34:48.454 --> 34:51.655
Mercenaries crossing from France

34:51.657 --> 34:53.423
through the North Sea,

34:53.425 --> 34:55.559
which, conveniently,

34:55.561 --> 34:59.563
was unguarded as my fleet
was in for service.

34:59.565 --> 35:02.866
It's quite a coincidence,
don't you think?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.134
I'm not sure what you mean.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.136
Ask what you
really want to know.

35:06.138 --> 35:09.139
Whether your queen is dead.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.108
I believe she is.

35:12.845 --> 35:14.811
You told Mary where to cross.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.181
Somehow you learned my fleet
would be out of commission

35:18.183 --> 35:20.183
and you told her.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.618
And I want you
to know something.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.387
I don't blame you.

35:24.389 --> 35:25.889
What?

35:25.891 --> 35:27.491
You can't blame yourself either.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.860
Do you have proof
that she was aboard?

35:29.862 --> 35:31.528
Proof that she's dead?

35:31.530 --> 35:33.730
It's her ship, Lola.
I know it in my bones.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.398
If she'd landed safely days ago,

35:35.400 --> 35:37.501
why hasn't
she reclaimed her throne?

35:37.503 --> 35:39.769
I would prefer a body,

35:39.771 --> 35:41.204
but the ship sank
beyond the rocks,

35:41.206 --> 35:42.372
and many of the corpses
will never be found.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.674
This can't be.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.611
If Mary is gone,
Scotland will fall into chaos

35:47.613 --> 35:49.546
and you will not
be safe there.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.182
You yourself said you didn't
want to return to France,

35:52.184 --> 35:54.417
to your husband.

35:54.419 --> 35:55.852
You lied to me,

35:55.854 --> 35:58.188
but<i> that,</i> I believe, was truth.

35:58.190 --> 36:00.924
I don't understand,
why aren't you angry with me?

36:00.926 --> 36:04.427
Because you were loyal
to your friend--

36:04.429 --> 36:05.529
your queen--

36:05.531 --> 36:08.231
till the end.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.933
I could use a friend like that,

36:09.935 --> 36:12.602
which is why I'm
inviting you to stay

36:12.604 --> 36:14.938
here in England,
with your son.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.841
Not as prisoners,
but as English subjects.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.710
Think about it.

36:20.712 --> 36:23.780
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.883
(sobbing)

36:30.956 --> 36:32.856
The door's locked.
No one's come or gone

36:32.858 --> 36:34.858
in the hour I've been waiting.
The Red Knights aren't there.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.626
They'll come as soon
as the first starts.

36:36.628 --> 36:38.962
Is the kingsguard ready?
In position,

36:38.964 --> 36:40.330
hiding in the narrows.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.699
All right then.
Here we go.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.411
LEITH:
Good shot, Charles.

37:08.927 --> 37:10.994
THIERRY: If there's
so much gunpowder in there,

37:10.996 --> 37:13.296
why won't it go off?
Give it a moment.

37:13.298 --> 37:15.432
Something's wrong.
We need to drop back.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.834
Not yet, let me see
what's happening.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.270
Felix, no.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.480
(groans)
Help!

37:38.290 --> 37:40.624
(both coughing)

37:40.626 --> 37:43.293
(gasping, coughing)

37:43.295 --> 37:45.295
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:45.297 --> 37:46.529
The weapons are gone.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.999
There's just grain inside,
burning grain.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.768
VILLAGERS:
Fire! Fire! Fire!

37:51.770 --> 37:52.669
Save the silo or we'll starve.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.472
(villagers shouting)

37:55.474 --> 37:56.439
It's the kingsguard.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.907
Stay back.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.344
Protect the king!
MAN: The king is under attack!

38:01.346 --> 38:02.445
Kingsguard, no not attack!
Do not attack!

38:02.447 --> 38:03.947
CHARLES:
There's been a terrible mistake,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.782
we're in search of enemies
of the crown.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.617
The king is here to punish us.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.953
They think you're burning
their food for revenge.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.955
Retribution for refusing
your tax.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.023
No, we're after the Red Knights!

38:13.025 --> 38:14.591
(indistinct shouting continues)

38:14.593 --> 38:16.026
Get the king back to the castle!

38:16.028 --> 38:18.962
Stay back!
(grunts)

38:18.964 --> 38:20.597
Do not attack!

38:20.599 --> 38:21.965
(grunting)

38:32.311 --> 38:33.943
CHARLES: The Red Knights
caught on to us, but how?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.378
I took precautions.

38:35.380 --> 38:38.315
Are they launching
a counter-attack as we speak?

38:38.317 --> 38:40.550
Is the castle in danger?
What have I done?

38:40.552 --> 38:42.085
(horse whinnying)

38:43.355 --> 38:44.821
It's the Red Knights.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.588
Thierry, run!

38:45.590 --> 38:47.857
(grunts)

38:49.528 --> 38:50.694
I told them to move the weapons.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.629
But thanks for sharing
your plan

38:52.631 --> 38:53.930
and giving me a head start
to the location.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.031
Gave us loads of time.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.633
You're a traitor.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.068
No, Charles, I'm a patriot.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.576
(indistinct conversations)

39:13.085 --> 39:14.617
(man groaning)

39:16.922 --> 39:19.356
(groaning continues)

39:37.442 --> 39:40.377
(gasps)
(panting)

39:40.379 --> 39:41.611
You...

39:41.613 --> 39:43.413
I'm so sorry.

39:43.415 --> 39:44.647
(moans)
Here.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.983
Drink this.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.820
You have magic in you.

39:51.923 --> 39:54.090
Mount up.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.125
If we leave her here,

39:55.127 --> 39:57.060
she won't survive.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.062
Good, she won't survive anyway,
let's go.

40:00.432 --> 40:01.498
(clears throat)

40:03.769 --> 40:05.902
(sighs)

40:10.742 --> 40:12.575
Allow me.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.110
Oh, thank you, Duncan.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.913
Is something wrong?

40:20.519 --> 40:21.851
I'm just nervous.

40:21.853 --> 40:25.054
It's been quite
a dangerous journey so far.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.689
We'll take good care of you.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.066
Are you all right?

40:37.068 --> 40:38.802
The Druids called them Wulvers,

40:38.804 --> 40:40.937
but I saw a pin
on Duncan's cloak

40:40.939 --> 40:42.772
that bears the insignia
of the Clan MacFie.

40:42.774 --> 40:45.175
These men don't just
hate my regime,

40:45.177 --> 40:46.676
these are the ones
who tried to assassinate me

40:46.678 --> 40:48.011
and killed Francis instead.

40:51.183 --> 40:53.149
We need to escape.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.150
When you're safely
on your throne,

40:54.152 --> 40:55.018
we'll rain hell down on them.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.786
I can't wait until then.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.122
The head of the clan,
a man named Munro,

40:59.124 --> 41:00.790
ordered my murder.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.158
Senneck said the chief
of the Wulvers

41:02.160 --> 41:04.027
has pillaged so many
of his own countrymen,

41:04.029 --> 41:05.628
that he has to remain
in hiding.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.964
We won't find him unless
we trick his followers

41:07.966 --> 41:10.033
into thinking we're such
valuable prisoners,

41:10.035 --> 41:11.534
they must take us
to their leader.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.772
Mary, if they learn
the queen of Scotland,

41:15.774 --> 41:18.141
a woman they want dead,
is travelling in their midst...

41:18.143 --> 41:20.076
I've been assured
no one in this region

41:20.078 --> 41:21.578
has seen my portrait.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.079
We will continue
with our cover story,

41:23.081 --> 41:24.581
they will escort us to Munro,

41:24.583 --> 41:28.785
and I will rip out
his heart as he did mine.
