04:57.240 --> 04:59.196
Tom, it's Robert.

04:59.280 --> 05:03.831
I need you to fill in for me. Kate's gone
into labor and there are complications.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.031
Mr. Thorn.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.918
- Is she all right?
- She's resting.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.116
And the child?

05:27.720 --> 05:29.631
The child is dead.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.513
She does not know.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.838
It was everything to her.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.717
A child.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.439
Mr. Thorn, your wife...

05:58.520 --> 06:02.638
There was damage to the womb.
She might not be able to...

06:02.720 --> 06:05.154
She might not be able to what?

06:21.600 --> 06:23.955
You love her very much.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.278
Then you must accept God's plan.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.189
He is quite beautiful.

06:40.280 --> 06:44.273
I knew the mother well.
Healthy in every way.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.313
- And the family?
- No family.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.116
The mother died, as your own child...

06:56.200 --> 06:58.236
in the same hour.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.160
And our child...

07:12.560 --> 07:15.279
May I see the body?

07:17.320 --> 07:21.552
What's to be gained?
Give your love to the living.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.358
For the sake of your wife, Mr. Thorn.

07:26.440 --> 07:30.194
God will forgive this little deception.

07:30.280 --> 07:33.352
And for the sake of this child.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.837
On this night, Mr. Thorn,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.474
God has given you a son.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.400
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.231
Who's that?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.310
That's our son.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.231
He's perfect.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.791
I love you.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.070
I love you too.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.359
No, it's good, it really is.

09:09.320 --> 09:11.311
What is it?

09:18.480 --> 09:20.471
Come on. Big blow.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.835
Thank you so much.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.029
Hi, Mike.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.395
Afternoon, Mrs. Thorn.
How's young Damien?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.948
He's fine.
Is my husband around?

09:46.040 --> 09:48.110
Yes, ma'am. He's expecting you.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.998
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Troy.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.593
Hi, Steven.

09:55.680 --> 09:58.148
- Hi, Kathy. It's great to see you.
- You too.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.118
I've gotta run.
I'll let Robert tell you the good news.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.918
- OK. Bye.
- Bye, Kathy.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.036
What good news?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.994
How was your Italian lesson?

10:12.960 --> 10:17.750
That's very good. I'll have to remember that
next time my watch is stolen on a sailing trip.

10:17.840 --> 10:19.910
All right. I'm on book one.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.155
Well, the good news is that
you might not have to open book two.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.354
Steven's been made
ambassador to Great Britain.

10:32.440 --> 10:34.078
Wow.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.230
That's great.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.199
We're going with him, Kate.
He's made me deputy.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.230
Oh, my God.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.639
Robert...

10:44.720 --> 10:47.109
London... That's wonderful.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.636
I'm number two now.
I couldn't wait to tell you.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.954
It's gonna be great, Kate.

11:18.680 --> 11:20.671
What's going on up there?

11:22.040 --> 11:24.349
Traffic.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.669
Well? Do you like it?

13:10.440 --> 13:12.317
It's big.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.436
Big. Bad big?

13:17.600 --> 13:19.875
Big big.

13:19.960 --> 13:23.589
It reminds me of Steven's place in Italy.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.630
What's that mean?

13:37.600 --> 13:39.318
Nothing.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.434
I thought you would like it.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.510
Sorry.

13:48.600 --> 13:53.515
Sometimes it feels
as if I'm stepping over Steven's corpse.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.554
You got this job because you earned it.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.437
Really?

14:00.520 --> 14:04.752
Nothing to do with the fact
that I'm the president's godson?

14:06.520 --> 14:12.436
Two senators and the president's sister
wanted that job, but he gave it to you.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.909
What does that tell you?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.070
That I love you.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.835
- So we'll take it.
- Do I have a choice?

14:26.920 --> 14:29.229
- No.
- Didn't think so.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.075
It is big.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.037
A little bit.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.837
Hello?

15:09.560 --> 15:10.709
Hello?

15:21.200 --> 15:22.952
Damien?

15:24.480 --> 15:25.629
Damien?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.033
Damien?

15:41.280 --> 15:43.032
No...

15:45.560 --> 15:47.676
Damien... Damien.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.589
Boo.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.388
Don't... don't ever do that again.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.948
Did I scare you, Mommy?

16:04.040 --> 16:06.235
I didn't mean to.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.355
I know.

16:12.440 --> 16:16.319
I know. I'm sorry.
I was just worried about you.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.875
- Ready? Come on, Damien, big breath...
- Three, two, one...

16:56.480 --> 16:58.471
Great.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.359
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.635
- I can take him.
- OK.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.631
Thanks.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.519
Damien.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.154
Damien.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.356
Look at me, Damien.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.150
It's all for you, Damien.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.349
It's all for you.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.391
It's OK, pal.

18:55.080 --> 18:57.310
It's OK.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.596
Here he is.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.068
- Have you read the papers today, Mr. Thorn?
- No, I'm afraid I haven't.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.233
- There's an article about the suicide.
- I'm here to welcome the Saudi ambassador...

19:46.320 --> 19:48.754
- Was she on drugs?
- Excuse me.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.196
Will the suicide affect
your performance as ambassador?

19:52.280 --> 19:55.192
Gentlemen, this way, please.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.838
It's all right.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.671
Are you OK?

20:07.480 --> 20:12.679
I'm very sorry. Please, send me the bill.
I'll cover the charges.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.957
It's all right, sir.
Let's just say that you owe me one.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.757
Robert?

20:26.840 --> 20:28.990
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.231
The tabloids are having a field day
with the nanny situation.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.710
I know. Let it go.
It'll all blow over.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.669
- I think we should issue a statement at least.
- Tom, please. Let it go this time, OK?

20:41.400 --> 20:45.279
Excuse me, sir. A Father Brennan
is waiting downstairs at reception.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.397
- Who?
- Father Brennan. The priest from Rome.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.152
Did he say what it was about?

20:54.240 --> 20:58.677
He called several times yesterday.
He said it was personal and urgent.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.716
Want me to handle this?

21:01.800 --> 21:04.951
No. No, I got this.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.555
Father Brennan.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.196
Robert Thorn.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.753
What can I do for you?

21:21.840 --> 21:24.559
We haven't much time, Mr. Thorn.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.079
Time for what?

21:27.160 --> 21:30.994
We must accept the Lord Jesus Christ
as our savior.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.592
Accept him now.
Ask for his forgiveness.

21:34.680 --> 21:39.231
Take Holy Communion, Mr. Thorn.
Drink of his blood, eat of his flesh.

21:39.320 --> 21:44.713
For only when he is within you
can you defeat the devil's son.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.351
I'm sorry, Father, I...

21:47.440 --> 21:50.557
Accept responsibility, Mr. Thorn.
You did it.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.870
You let them do it.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.514
I think there's been some mistake...

21:57.600 --> 22:00.273
He's killed before. He'll kill again.

22:00.360 --> 22:04.148
He'll kill
until everything that's yours is his.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.631
Forgive me, Father,
but I really should get back to work. Sorry.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.068
I was at the hospital, Mr. Thorn.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.750
The night your son was born.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.478
I...

22:31.080 --> 22:33.116
I participated.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.752
I witnessed the birth.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.597
I beg of you, please, Mr. Thorn.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.240
What do you want?

22:45.320 --> 22:48.232
I want to save you, Mr. Thorn.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.550
So Christ will save me

22:50.640 --> 22:53.837
and rescue me from eternal damnation.

22:53.920 --> 22:56.036
What do you know about my son?

22:56.640 --> 22:58.631
Everything.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.510
I saw its mother.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.834
- You saw my wife.
- No. I saw its mother.

23:06.920 --> 23:08.911
You're referring to my wife.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.072
Its mother, Mr. Thorn. Its mother.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.357
- OK, that's enough. Sergeant...
- His mother is a jackal.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.829
Yes, sir.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.832
Everything all right, Mr. Ambassador?

23:22.760 --> 23:26.469
Yes, Travis. Please escort
this gentleman out of the building.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.549
Yes, sir.

23:27.640 --> 23:33.556
You must accept the Lord Jesus each
and every day, Mr. Thorn. Drink his blood.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.108
It is the only way, Mr. Thorn.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.869
- How's the nanny search coming?
- Frustrating.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.713
- No one you like?
- Not really.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.759
- Well, maybe we don't need one.
- What does that mean?

24:13.840 --> 24:17.549
Nothing. Just maybe we don't need a nanny.
You're not working...

24:17.640 --> 24:20.598
I'm trying to raise our child. That's work.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.797
I'm here with him every minute. You're not.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.148
All I'm saying
is maybe we don't need a nanny.

24:27.240 --> 24:30.312
Give you and Damien a chance to bond.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.710
Now Damien and I don't bond.

24:33.800 --> 24:36.553
That's not what I meant, Kate.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.514
Can we start over, please?

24:47.520 --> 24:49.954
I'm sorry you had a bad day.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.030
Mine wasn't exactly uneventful either.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.680
Can we call it a draw?

24:58.760 --> 25:00.751
I'm sorry.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.991
Come here.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.671
- Hon?
- Yeah?

25:16.360 --> 25:19.830
- There's something that I think I...
- Excuse me.

25:21.840 --> 25:26.118
- Yes, Mrs. Horton?
- Mrs. Baylock is here.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.154
I thought I was done for the day.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.038
- Shall I show her in?
- Yes, please.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.193
Good afternoon, Mr. Thorn.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.111
- Hello.
- Pleasure to meet you.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.589
- This is my wife Katherine.
- Mrs. Thorn.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.114
- Please.
- Thank you.

25:48.320 --> 25:53.553
If I may say, I realize
this must be a difficult time for you.

25:53.640 --> 25:56.313
I'm genuinely sorry for your loss.

25:57.040 --> 26:02.990
You know, sometimes the younger girls,
away from their families...

26:03.080 --> 26:06.152
Well, the job can be hard on them.

26:06.960 --> 26:12.114
But, you know, for me
caring for children has been the joy of my life.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.239
I've really been so lucky.
I love my job.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.555
I don't think I have your résumé.

26:22.600 --> 26:26.991
The agency sometimes forgets,
with all the girls they send out.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.389
This isn't the first time.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.119
Here it is.
I sometimes bring an extra copy.

26:32.200 --> 26:36.159
I've been raising children
for almost 40 years now, Mrs. Thorn.

26:36.240 --> 26:40.119
I helped my own mother raise
my brothers and sisters - I was the eldest -

26:40.200 --> 26:43.192
and I guess the habit sort of stuck.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.512
I'm not the parent, and I never forget that.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.114
But I am an extra pair of hands

26:50.200 --> 26:55.513
and a responsible substitute
when you're out of the house.

26:55.960 --> 26:58.599
May I see the boy?

27:07.800 --> 27:10.268
He's beautiful.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.319
I'll just be right back.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.750
Hello, Damien.

27:28.840 --> 27:31.115
I'm Mrs. Baylock.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.030
Don't be afraid.
I'm here to protect you.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.788
- Kate.
- I'm coming.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.076
Mrs. Baylock?

29:05.200 --> 29:08.272
Where's Damien? I asked you
to have him dressed and ready.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.158
I'm afraid he's a bit under the weather.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.150
He was fine a minute ago.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.510
I was concerned about him last night.
He didn't sleep well.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.353
I think he might
be coming down with something.

29:21.440 --> 29:26.309
And it's such a long ceremony.
I really don't think it's a good idea.

29:27.760 --> 29:32.276
Mrs. Baylock, have my son
dressed and in the car in five minutes.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.717
What's wrong, sweetie?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.355
It's just a church, that's all.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.310
I know how you feel, kiddo.

30:09.800 --> 30:10.789
Robert...

30:12.120 --> 30:14.714
You OK, tiger?

30:20.160 --> 30:22.390
Is he sick?

30:24.200 --> 30:26.236
Damien, what's wrong?

30:27.960 --> 30:29.359
Damien?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.757
Damien, stop it.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.357
Damien, stop it now.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.112
No.

30:46.360 --> 30:48.237
Damien, stop it.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.595
Go. Drive the car. Go, now.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.717
Home, please, David.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.790
Hold still.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.194
Maybe we should call a doctor.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.396
No, it's not that bad.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.709
No, I mean for Damien.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.268
He's fine, Kate.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.955
That boy has never been sick
a day in his life.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.109
I know.

31:49.200 --> 31:51.395
It's strange, isn't it?

31:51.480 --> 31:53.710
What, that he's healthy?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.590
It's unusual, Robert.

31:59.200 --> 32:04.149
Other kids get colds, runny noses, the flu...

32:05.680 --> 32:07.796
But Damien...

32:07.880 --> 32:10.474
Nothing. Not once.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.672
It's not just my imagination.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.755
He's strange.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.715
- It's...
- What?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.271
It's different.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.992
He's different.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.238
Now why would you think
something like that?

32:42.520 --> 32:45.432
He's just a little boy, Kate.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.590
He got scared, that's all.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.471
I'm gonna go to bed.

32:54.560 --> 32:55.595
OK.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.551
Easy.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.318
Easy, boy.

34:39.280 --> 34:41.235
Quiet down.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.989
This is the master of the house.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.431
Mrs. Baylock, what is this?

34:48.520 --> 34:51.751
- Sir?
- This dog.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.353
We found him outside.

34:55.320 --> 35:01.350
- Who said you could bring a dog in here?
- I'm sorry, sir. Did he scare you?

35:01.440 --> 35:04.989
- That's not the point...
- He'll be a good watchdog, sir.

35:05.080 --> 35:09.232
Believe me, you'll be grateful
on those long trips away.

35:10.240 --> 35:16.679
Mrs. Baylock, when and if we need a dog,
I'll pick one out myself.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.751
Thank you.

35:18.840 --> 35:21.912
Damien has grown quite fond of him, sir.

35:27.040 --> 35:31.556
Tomorrow morning you'll call the RSPCA
and have him removed.

35:31.640 --> 35:33.517
Do you understand?

35:34.960 --> 35:36.598
Come on.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.110
Good night, Mr. Thorn.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.713
So, how's the new nanny working out?

36:23.800 --> 36:27.110
She seems good.
But so did the last one.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.676
I know the two of you were there
when the other girl...

36:35.760 --> 36:40.072
With your kids. I hope they're OK.

36:40.160 --> 36:43.197
- They're fine. Really.
- Yeah, they're fine.

36:43.280 --> 36:47.273
Come along, children.
Stay close together.

36:47.360 --> 36:48.634
Damien.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.278
Damien.

36:59.280 --> 37:00.599
Damien?

37:07.480 --> 37:08.959
Hey.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.711
Damien?

37:12.480 --> 37:17.235
What's the matter? Those other kids
didn't wanna play with you?

37:20.040 --> 37:22.349
They're afraid.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.195
Let's go look at the birds.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.838
Let's do that.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.558
Hi.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.790
Everything all right?

38:29.120 --> 38:30.553
Yeah.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.034
How's Damien?

38:50.760 --> 38:53.149
What's wrong?

38:57.040 --> 38:59.918
Did something happen today, Kate?

39:06.760 --> 39:09.115
We went to the zoo...

39:10.800 --> 39:13.268
with all the other children.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.913
There's something about Damien.

39:21.160 --> 39:24.436
He's so far away.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.709
Something's not right.

39:37.800 --> 39:41.793
I must be a terrible person
for even thinking such things.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.757
No. No.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.910
Kate...

39:48.520 --> 39:50.556
I need to talk to someone.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.119
OK. OK.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.155
What can I do, baby?

40:08.560 --> 40:10.949
I need to talk to someone.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.712
OK.

40:57.920 --> 41:02.391
Tomorrow, Mr. Thorn. One o'clock.
Bishop's Park, by the bridge.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.438
Just five minutes
and you'll never see me again.

41:05.520 --> 41:09.274
Your wife's in grave danger.
She'll die if you don't come.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.798
Damien?

43:30.480 --> 43:32.835
Are you OK?

43:40.640 --> 43:42.278
Damien?

44:41.960 --> 44:47.273
All right, you've got your five minutes.
Now tell me why I'm here.

44:47.360 --> 44:51.592
"When the Jews return to Zion
And a comet rips the sky,

44:51.680 --> 44:56.834
When the Holy Roman Empire rises,
Then you and I must die.

44:56.920 --> 45:01.550
From the eternal sea he rises,
Creating armies on either shore,

45:01.640 --> 45:06.156
Turning man against his brother,
Till man exists no more."

45:06.240 --> 45:08.834
You said my wife was in danger.

45:09.400 --> 45:13.678
Go to the town of Megiddo
in the walled city of Jezreel.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.194
There lives a man named Bugenhagen.

45:16.280 --> 45:20.796
He alone can describe
how the child must die.

45:22.760 --> 45:26.196
What child?
What are you talking about?

45:27.840 --> 45:32.356
Your son, Mr. Thorn.
The son of the devil.

45:33.080 --> 45:36.356
I came here
because you said my wife was in danger.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.629
She's pregnant.

45:43.320 --> 45:47.199
- That's impossible.
- That's what they told you, Mr. Thorn.

45:47.280 --> 45:52.957
He will not allow the child to be born.
He'll kill it while it slumbers in the womb.

45:53.040 --> 45:56.316
He'll kill the unborn child
and then he'll kill your wife.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.631
And then, when he's certain
to inherit all that you have,

45:59.720 --> 46:03.918
then, Mr. Thorn, then he'll kill you.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.638
- That's enough.
- He has to die, Mr. Thorn.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.439
You must act now, or all will be lost.

46:10.520 --> 46:15.878
Go to the town of Megiddo.
See Bugenhagen, before it's all too late.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.917
Now you listen to me.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.835
I don't know who you are or what you want,
but stay away from my family. Understand?

46:24.920 --> 46:28.469
I don't want to see
or hear from you ever again.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.477
You'll see me in hell, Mr. Thorn.

46:38.080 --> 46:40.799
We'll spend eternity together.

48:51.600 --> 48:54.398
Damien, could you please stop that?

48:57.960 --> 48:59.552
Damien.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.071
Mrs. Baylock.

49:05.040 --> 49:08.396
- What's wrong?
- That noise is driving me crazy.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.789
Mrs. Baylock.

49:11.480 --> 49:12.549
Yes, ma'am?

49:12.640 --> 49:15.234
Could you please take him out of here?

49:15.320 --> 49:17.709
He's playing quietly, Kate.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.473
I said take him out of here.

49:20.560 --> 49:21.629
Yes, ma'am.

49:22.800 --> 49:26.998
Come along, Damien.
Mummy's not feeling well.

49:27.080 --> 49:29.071
We'll go take a walk.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.510
How's the therapy coming?

49:43.200 --> 49:45.031
Can't you tell?

49:45.680 --> 49:48.035
Dr. Greer wants to speak with you.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.111
About what?

49:50.760 --> 49:52.034
Kate?

49:58.200 --> 50:00.839
We have a problem, Robert.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.110
I'm pregnant.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.592
What?

50:06.680 --> 50:08.796
I'm having an abortion.

50:12.560 --> 50:15.552
- Kate, listen, we should talk about this.
- No.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.272
I am not having any more children.

50:19.360 --> 50:21.396
I want it out of me.

51:03.280 --> 51:07.637
Look, Mr. Thorn,
this session was Katherine's idea,

51:07.720 --> 51:10.678
so I encourage you to speak freely.

51:15.520 --> 51:22.437
Well, Kate's been under a lot of pressure
recently with our son Damien.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.431
Things have been...

51:29.520 --> 51:30.999
difficult.

51:31.920 --> 51:35.959
I suppose that's why she doesn't like
the idea of having another child.

51:36.040 --> 51:39.430
She's certainly having a hard time coping.

51:39.520 --> 51:44.230
So much so that she's developed
what I call delusional rationalizations.

51:45.040 --> 51:46.712
Like what?

51:48.000 --> 51:52.790
Well, she fantasizes that Damien is evil,
for instance.

51:55.120 --> 51:57.190
What do you mean, evil?

51:57.280 --> 52:00.397
Forget about that, Mr. Thorn.
It's just a fantasy.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.438
She also fantasizes
that he's not really hers.

52:04.080 --> 52:08.358
- She told you that?
- It's just inside her head.

52:11.240 --> 52:14.915
Do you believe in God, Dr. Greer?

52:15.000 --> 52:16.831
Excuse me?

52:17.320 --> 52:19.311
God.

52:20.600 --> 52:22.591
Do you believe?

52:22.680 --> 52:26.992
Mr. Thorn, my beliefs
really don't have anything to do with this.

52:28.560 --> 52:33.076
Look, Mr. Thorn,
if you want to help your wife,

52:33.160 --> 52:35.469
you really must consider an abortion.

52:35.560 --> 52:38.120
We're not having an abortion.

52:39.960 --> 52:42.428
We need this child.

54:33.760 --> 54:35.034
Damien.

54:46.400 --> 54:47.594
Damien...

54:48.440 --> 54:50.829
please help.

55:11.880 --> 55:14.075
- Ambassador Thorn.
- How is she?

55:14.160 --> 55:18.790
She'll recover, but she has a concussion,
broken collarbone and internal bleeding.

55:18.880 --> 55:22.429
- Internal bleeding?
- That's our biggest worry at the moment.

55:22.520 --> 55:24.556
She's pregnant.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.995
I'm afraid not.

55:27.520 --> 55:30.273
She lost the child?

55:30.360 --> 55:32.351
Yes.

55:57.360 --> 55:58.952
Robert.

55:59.040 --> 56:00.837
What is it, babe?

56:00.920 --> 56:03.718
Please don't let him kill me.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.510
What?

56:12.600 --> 56:16.354
Don't let him kill me.

57:12.680 --> 57:13.999
Hello?

57:14.080 --> 57:17.197
Mr. Ambassador? My name's Keith Jennings.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.750
- Who?
- I'm a photographer. You broke my camera.

57:21.280 --> 57:24.909
- How did you get this number?
- No, no, please don't hang up.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.675
This is not about the camera,
it's about you. And a priest.

57:28.760 --> 57:31.149
A Brennan, a Father Brennan.

57:32.040 --> 57:36.591
You were seen with him
moments before he was killed.

57:37.840 --> 57:40.673
You see anything unusual?

57:43.040 --> 57:46.032
- No.
- Look, here. Look. See?

57:46.120 --> 57:47.838
There.

57:49.080 --> 57:54.154
I know, I know. I didn't think much of it either
at first. Thought it was just a bad roll of film.

57:54.240 --> 57:58.233
But then it happened again.
Here. You see?

57:58.320 --> 58:00.390
That's on another roll.

58:00.480 --> 58:04.519
And then again on the digital files.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.751
There. That's digital.
That's another camera.

58:15.240 --> 58:17.310
Here we go.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.073
Our friend Father Brennan.

58:20.680 --> 58:23.319
Look at this. Here.

58:24.040 --> 58:26.634
And here's one I snapped ten days later.

58:31.640 --> 58:33.517
- Same thing.
- Yeah.

58:33.600 --> 58:38.628
Only much more pronounced on this one,
actually making contact with the body.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.191
The rest...

58:46.080 --> 58:48.275
of course, is history.

58:51.640 --> 58:53.471
I know.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.558
I didn't get it either.

58:57.640 --> 59:00.916
Which is why I started digging.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.629
The coroner's report showed
that Brennan was riddled with cancer.

59:04.720 --> 59:11.114
He was high on morphine most of the time,
injecting himself two or three times a day.

59:11.200 --> 59:13.760
- He knew he was dying.
- Apparently.

59:13.840 --> 59:17.958
He said he wanted to be forgiven by Christ.

59:19.480 --> 59:22.392
No atheists in foxholes, eh?

59:25.040 --> 59:27.474
Here we go.

59:27.560 --> 59:31.758
Now, externally
his body was completely normal -

59:31.840 --> 59:36.470
apart from one small item
on the inside of the left thigh.

59:36.560 --> 59:38.312
Here.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.992
What is it?

59:41.080 --> 59:43.548
That's three sixes.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.200
Six hundred and sixty-six.

59:47.040 --> 59:49.474
- A tattoo?
- No.

59:51.040 --> 59:54.828
The biopsy showed that
that was a birthmark.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.279
Come with me.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.633
The best is yet to come.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.192
He lived here?

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.313
Yes.

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.236
If you can call it living.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:26.029
These are all pages from the Bible.
Thousands of them.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.192
Every inch of wall space is covered.

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:33.559
And crucifixes...

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:36.200
Hundreds of crucifixes.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.116
I'd say he was trying to keep something out,
wouldn't you?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.636
He was obviously out of his mind.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.790
Was he?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.953
The first thing I found was his diary.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:57.397
Only it's not so much about him
as about you.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.118
And it's a little obsessive.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.112
Notes on whenever you left the house,

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.875
where you went, where you ate,
your speaking engagements...

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.633
- Can I see that?
- Yes, certainly.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.311
You'll see that the last entry says you were
scheduled to meet him in Bishop's Park...

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.956
the same day that he died.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.430
However, the really interesting items are here.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.308
If we're ever gonna get to the bottom of this,
this is where we begin.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:38.279
The first is a clipping
from some astrology magazine,

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.749
a report of an unusual phenomenon.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.149
It's a comet
in the shape of a glowing star,

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.959
much like the Star of Bethlehem
2,000 years ago -

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.797
only this one happened a little closer
to home, on the European continent,

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.030
just five years ago.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.155
June 6, to be exact.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.717
I assume that date rings a bell.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.359
Yes.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.191
Yeah.
Then you'll recognize the second clipping,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.068
which is a birth announcement
from a newspaper in Rome -

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.551
again, five years ago,
sixth day, sixth month.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.794
Was your son born at 6 A.M.?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.070
My son is dead.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.758
I don't know whose son I'm raising.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:53.152
Well, if you don't mind, Mr. Thorn,
I'd like to try and help you find that out.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:57.638
No.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.636
It's my problem.

01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:07.195
No. No, no, no, please, please.
You're wrong.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.510
You see, it's also my problem.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.638
See, when I first came into this room
with the police, I took a number of photos

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.033
and I happened to catch a reflection of myself
in this mirror here.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.076
Take a look.

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.394
That's rather an unusual effect, isn't it?

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.991
All right.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:48.113
Let's go. Get your stuff.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.514
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.439
I'm sorry, I have to.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.238
No.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.794
I'm so scared.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.713
Kate, there's nothing to be scared of.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.911
Nothing.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.916
I promise.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:45.311
That's not it.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.558
It's the right address.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.672
Apparently there was a terrible fire.
The old hospital burned down.

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.190
Five years ago.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.159
<i>Molti morti-</i> many dead.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.869
The fire started in the hall of records
in the basement.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:46.750
It went up like a torch.
Shot up the stairwells.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:50.917
The third floor became an inferno.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.275
The third floor.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.828
The maternity ward.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:01.716
There was a priest.
A very tall man. He was in charge.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.075
- Spiletto.
- Yes.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.230
That's his name. That's him.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.515
Do you know where he is now?

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.716
A monastery...

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.438
in Subiaco.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.995
Subiaco.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:05.198
I haven't found this poem you talked about,
but I have a good idea where it's from.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:10.149
It seems to be a composite of prophesies
from the Bible, from Daniel, from Revelation,

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:16.554
whereby the time of the Antichrist
is heralded by the Jews returning to Israel.

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.676
That's the poem.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.752
"When the Jews return to Zion",

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.116
and something about a comet.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.270
That's here.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.395
"A great star blazing like a torch
fell from the sky."

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:35.553
Now, these are signs,
together with the rise of the Roman Empire,

01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:38.518
which signify the birth of the Antichrist.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:41.591
As we know, the Jews have returned to Zion.

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:45.593
We've seen evidence of a comet.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.910
The rise of the Roman Empire is...

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:54.916
The Treaty of Rome.
The European Union.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.712
Revelation 13:
"And I stood upon the sand of the sea

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.268
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea."

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:07.478
That's the poem: "From the eternal sea
he rises, creating armies on either shore."

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.471
Now, the sea - bear with me -
the sea in this context

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.279
has been interpreted
as representing politics -

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:18.593
the sea which eternally rages with conflict,
with turmoil, with revolution.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.875
Politics.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:27.911
"From the eternal sea he rises" - the devil's
child shall rise from the world of politics.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.348
They chose you, Robert.

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.357
Father Spiletto.

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.114
My name is Robert Thorn.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.111
We met in Rome.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.839
You remember me?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.311
There was a child.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.720
I need to know where he's from.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.591
I'm afraid it's no use.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.391
You said you knew his mother.
Where is she now?

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.954
- Please, sir.
- Where is she?

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.474
I must insist.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.120
You confessed to them.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:37.040
Now confess to me.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.315
Where is she now?

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.351
Cervet...

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.592
- What does it mean?
- Cerveteri.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.311
It's an old cemetery
from the Etruscan time.

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.229
Where is this place?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.116
Where is it?

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.760
You'll find it on a map.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.594
It is perhaps 50 kilometers north of Rome.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.153
Robert.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.231
Here.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.391
Look at the date.

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:33.519
June 6, five years ago.
Mother and child.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.794
"Maria Avedici Santoya."

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:53.351
Damien's mother.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:58.592
But if that's her, then who's the child?

01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:02.313
Hand me that iron.

01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.989
Try to free up those edges.

01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.511
It's coming.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.272
What the fuck is this?

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:58.031
The priest...

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.596
He said its mother was a...

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.234
Was a what?

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:13.795
- The other one.
- What for? There's nothing there.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.839
What if there is?
Maybe he's alive somewhere.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:23.277
- Who?
- My son.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.111
Oh, God...

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.311
They killed him.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.118
They took him from her...

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:50.191
and they killed him.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.035
Come on.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.950
Let's go. Go.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.631
Excuse me.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:31.235
I'm the family nanny.
Here to spread a bit of cheer.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.551
I just gave her her night-time meds.
She's barely awake.

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.189
I understand. I wonder if I could see her,
just for a few minutes?

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.430
No, I'm sorry, but I can't.

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.719
Her son picked these out himself.
He'd be heartbroken if she didn't get them.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.950
I promised him.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.713
I'm not sure if he should see her like this.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.917
OK. I'll park him over here.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.431
There you go.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:01.795
I'll be back in a minute, sweetie.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:20.191
Pretty.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.951
Hi.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.589
It's only me. Don't be afraid.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.432
We have to find the town
Father Brennan mentioned.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.115
- Megiddo.
- Right. I'll get hold of some maps.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.670
Come on.
Come on, pick up the goddamn phone.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.318
No...

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:47.113
No...

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:51.838
- No... No...
- Good girl.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.190
Almost there.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.752
Come along, sweetie. All done.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.759
Hello?

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.229
Tom. Listen, I just tried...

01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.956
Are you with Kate?

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.752
But I just...

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:34.198
No, she...

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.437
Look at his little hands.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.558
Drink his blood.

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:48.269
What the hell happened to you?

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.834
Did you fall asleep?

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.194
Yeah.

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:58.797
No wonder you've been staying awake.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.869
I found out about the town of Megiddo.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.192
It's derived from the word "Armageddon" -
the end of the world.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.239
It's underground,
just south of Jerusalem.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.515
There's an excavation going on there -
some American university.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.956
I don't suppose you remember that name?

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:23.590
Bugenhagen.

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:25.432
Bugenhagen?

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.270
That was his name.

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:33.668
I remember the poem, too.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:40.550
"When the Jews return to Zion

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.791
And a comet fills the sky,

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:48.670
And the Holy Roman Empire rises,
Then you and I must die.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.473
From the eternal sea he rises,
Creating armies on either shore,

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:58.313
Turning man against his brother...

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.272
Till man exists no more."

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:10.518
Kate's dead.

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.879
I want Damien dead as well.

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.952
Bugenhagen?

01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.479
That little priest, Brennan.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.070
Is he dead yet?

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.039
Yes.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.036
Then we have work to do. Come.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.877
It must be done on hallowed ground.
In the grounds of a church.

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:38.997
The blood must be spilled
on the altar of God.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:43.870
Each knife must be buried up to the hilt,

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.033
and then set
so as to form the sign of a cross.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.955
The first knife is the most important,

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.318
for it extinguishes physical life
and sets the center of the cross.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:02.997
The subsequent knives extinguish
spiritual life and radiate outwards.

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:06.752
This is a child we're talking about.

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.229
A small boy
who I've raised as my own son.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.791
He's not your son. He's a beast.
He's evil incarnate. Don't you forget that.

01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:17.429
- What if you're wrong? What if he isn't?
- I'm not wrong.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.080
- How do I know that?
- God, look...

01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.799
He bears a birthmark.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:26.670
A sequence of sixes.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:30.833
So says the Bible.
As do all the apostles of Satan.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:36.793
- No. He doesn't have it.
- He must have it.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:41.715
I bathe him.
I know every inch of his body.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.756
He doesn't have it.

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.356
If the sign isn't visible,
then it must be hidden beneath the hair.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.796
Remove that, you'll find the number.

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.519
What about the woman, the nanny?

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:58.513
She's an apostate of hell.
She'll die before permitting this.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.316
Kill him.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.912
No.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.039
No.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:17.268
It's insane. All of you. You... Oh, my God.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.673
Don't lose your nerve now, man.
We'll all be in the cesspool if you do.

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.595
Stop.

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.399
Thorn, stop.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.074
You can’t just walk away from this.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:50.153
What the fuck did you think he was gonna
say? Why else have we come here?

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:52.993
He's a drunk.
An insane, delusional drunk,

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.232
who, like every religious fanatic,
thinks arcane scripture justifies killing.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.392
What about me?
What about the photographs?

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:03.392
What if I'm next?

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:10.756
Listen to yourself.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:18.680
You're asking me to stab a child.
A little boy.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:22.719
Can't you see how insane that is?

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.917
It's not real, Keith.
There is no devil, there is no God.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.276
There is only here and now, and life.

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:35.513
And that's something I would never take away
from any man, certainly not my own son.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.038
Well, if you won't, I will.

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.310
No.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.795
No.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.199
No.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:58.839
No. No. No.

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.472
No. No. No.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:09.358
No. No. No. No.

01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.556
No. No.

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.192
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.998
hallowed be thy name.

01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.479
No. No. No.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.199
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.669
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:30.869
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.758
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.751
And lead us not into temptation...

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.479
Please, Daddy, don't.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.150
Stop.

01:41:05.320 --> 01:41:08.596
Mr. President, your car is ready, sir.
