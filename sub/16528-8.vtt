WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:03.068
    ADULT ADAM:
   <i> In high school in the '80s,</i>
   <i> you had to get creative</i>

00:03.070 --> 00:04.703
       <i> when it came to finding</i>
       <i> your place at school,</i>

00:04.705 --> 00:08.106
     <i> and I knew exactly</i>
     <i> where I wanted to belong.</i>

00:08.109 --> 00:10.743
              (VOCALIZING)

00:10.745 --> 00:11.877
      Oh! (LAUGHS)

00:11.879 --> 00:15.447
 You are the greatest Tin Boy
 the world has ever seen!

00:15.449 --> 00:17.716
 (GASPS) Oh, I'm sorry.
 Tin Man.

00:17.718 --> 00:18.817
   My delicious,
   little Tin Man!

00:18.819 --> 00:22.087
   You don't think auditioning
   in full costume is too much?

00:22.089 --> 00:23.622
 You're too much!
 (SQUEALS)

00:23.624 --> 00:28.360
   ADULT ADAM: <i> Unfortunately,</i>
  <i> not everyone shared</i>
  <i> my mom's enthusiasm.</i>

00:29.296 --> 00:30.896
                   Hey, bro!

00:31.098 --> 00:32.430
         Yeah?

00:33.267 --> 00:35.000
          Ow! Why?

00:35.002 --> 00:37.102
      I have a well-established
      rep at school

00:37.104 --> 00:39.238
       as basically the coolest
       human of all time.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.242
        And you'll embarrass me
        and yourself
        if you do the musical.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.476
      Sure,
      I'm no Ben Vereen,

00:44.478 --> 00:45.544
    but I'm really growing
    as a performer.

00:45.546 --> 00:49.681
 I don't care if you act better
 than Jean-Claude Van Damme!

00:49.683 --> 00:50.616
     You're in high school now.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.952
       The last thing you want
       is to be branded
       a lame-ass theater geek.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.488
 You're saying
 my popularity hinges solely

00:56.490 --> 00:58.190
    on me not doing
    the musical?

00:58.192 --> 01:00.125
      This is high school, bro.

01:00.127 --> 01:02.394
          Theater is the lowest
          of the low,

01:02.396 --> 01:03.962
            and nothing's gonna
            change that.

01:03.964 --> 01:04.962
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> Well, nothing except</i>

01:04.965 --> 01:07.366
 <i> the biggest musical sensation</i>
 <i> of the '80s.</i>

01:07.368 --> 01:10.069
                  One word...
                 <i> "Phantom."</i>

01:10.071 --> 01:10.536
         No way!
              Sweet!

01:10.538 --> 01:13.705
 ADULT ADAM: <i> Before</i> "Hamilton,"
 "Phantom"<i> was king of</i>
<i> all musicals.</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:14.740
    <i> Even non-theater geeks</i>
    <i> loved it.</i>

01:14.742 --> 01:18.043
 That show made me cry,
 and I don't care who knows it.

01:18.045 --> 01:22.614
  After an exhilarating weekend
  in New York City,

01:22.616 --> 01:23.949
        I stayed in a hostel.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.584
          I have decided
          to change the musical

01:25.586 --> 01:28.754
           from that that sappy
           schlock fest that is
          <i> The Wizard of Oz,</i>

01:28.756 --> 01:32.324
        and tackle the greatest
        musical sensation
        of our generation.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.959
     But don't we, like,
     need permission

01:33.961 --> 01:35.994
 from Andrew Lloyd Webber
 to do his show?

01:35.996 --> 01:38.497
     We do,
     and he's granted it to us.

01:38.499 --> 01:39.064
         What?
                   In spirit.

01:39.066 --> 01:42.634
     Look, do you want to be a
     giant wussbag for the rest
     of your life or be a star?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.136
     Well, you are the adult,
     so...

01:44.138 --> 01:45.838
       We're doing the greatest
       musical ever written!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.873
 Wait. Won't your brother kick
 your ass if you do the play?

01:47.875 --> 01:51.510
         I'll just play it cool
         around Barry.
         He won't even notice.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.746
 Well, I'm off to school.
 Have a nice day.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.348
              Thanks.

01:56.851 --> 01:58.117
    <i> � I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:58.119 --> 02:02.788
     <i> � But nonetheless,</i>
     <i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:04.492 --> 02:05.624
   <i> � I don't know the future</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:09.228
 <i> � But the past keeps getting</i>
 <i> clearer every day �</i>

02:09.229 --> 02:11.997
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was November 30,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:11.999 --> 02:14.466
<i> and Erica was planning</i>
<i> her winter-semester schedule.</i>

02:14.468 --> 02:18.203
   Okay, Pops.
   I just finished the ultimate
   slacker schedule.

02:18.205 --> 02:19.538
           Now that my college
           applications are in,

02:19.540 --> 02:22.841
      I can finally, completely
      give in to my senioritis.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.309
  A lot of my friends
  have that.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.644
 I-It's not as joyful
 with them.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.413
              First period,
              I kick things off
              with study hall,

02:28.415 --> 02:29.248
              ease into my day.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.883
            And then it's on
            to second period,

02:30.885 --> 02:31.783
             another study hall
             for naps,

02:31.785 --> 02:34.987
          and then typing class
          and then an easy "A"
          in home EC,

02:34.989 --> 02:37.289
      and then ceramics,
      and then intro to summer.

02:37.291 --> 02:37.956
    That's a class?

02:37.958 --> 02:39.458
      It's an independent study
      I created.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.094
 You know, there's a science
 to getting a good base tan.

02:42.096 --> 02:43.862
 Well,
 you outdid yourself.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.532
 This schedule really does
 spit in the face

02:46.534 --> 02:47.799
 of education
 as we know it.

02:47.801 --> 02:51.036
 Got to admit,
 all this prepping
 and planning,

02:51.038 --> 02:52.137
 very mature of you.

02:52.139 --> 02:53.605
       You approve of all this?

02:53.607 --> 02:56.175
 She's gonna be going
 to college soon.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.910
 My job here is done.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.845
         Your job? As a parent?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.914
 Yep. Gonna be
 phoning it in from now on.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.082
          And this has been you
          not phoning it in.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.684
   I've been working
   my ass off.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.053
         Hey, Boopie.
         What's with the board?

03:08.055 --> 03:10.055
       It's a year of maxing
       and relaxing

03:10.057 --> 03:11.557
 with nonstop blow-off classes.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.926
   Well, at least you're taking
   one real class.

03:13.928 --> 03:15.093
                    Which is...
           Home ec.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.229
 Running a house is the hardest
 job in the world.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.331
      You know, some people put
      a man on the moon,

03:19.333 --> 03:20.499
            and others put parm
            on a chicken.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.968
 Uh, you sound insane
 right now.

03:22.970 --> 03:23.769
 Home economics

03:23.771 --> 03:25.871
 is the cornerstone
 of civilization.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.174
       Or it's a class football
       players take to make
       drop cookies.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.576
          That's what
          they're teaching you?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.844
 How to drop a hunk of batter
 on a sheet?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.947
 When did you get
 so anti-drop cookie?

03:34.949 --> 03:37.382
    They're not gonna teach you
    how to darn a sock,

03:37.384 --> 03:39.952
 pepper a ham
 or bleach an undie?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.186
 I'm in the mood
 for drop cookies.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.555
         It's important for you
         to have the knowledge

03:43.557 --> 03:44.957
 that your grandmother had

03:44.959 --> 03:46.592
 and her grandmother had
 before her.

03:46.594 --> 03:49.228
   Yeah, well, I'll hire a maid
   who has that knowledge.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.931
 Until then, I have some maxing
 and relaxing to do.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.333
     Will you make me
     some drop cookies?

03:54.335 --> 03:58.704
  ADULT ADAM:
 <i> Unfortunately for Erica,</i>
 <i> the maxing was short-lived.</i>

03:58.706 --> 04:00.439
 Oh, sweet mother of mercy.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.307
    Welcome to home economics.
 What are you...

04:02.309 --> 04:04.476
      I'll be your, your sub
      for the day and week.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.079
    How are...
          Possibly month.
          Only time will tell.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.614
 What did you do
 to Ms. Horokawa?

04:08.616 --> 04:10.382
         Oh, you mean
         Mrs. Silverstein?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.918
      I introduced her
      to the man of her dreams.
      They eloped.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.587
     Now they're in Belize
     on the trip of a lifetime.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.822
     You monster.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.289
         Buckle up, angel.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.591
     You're about to embark
     on a journey
     through the domestic arts.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.828
  Mrs. Goldberg?
           Chef Goldberg.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.364
 All due respect, Chef,
 but the team and I

04:25.366 --> 04:27.332
 kind of took this class
 for an easy "A."

04:27.334 --> 04:30.068
     Well, the only easy thing
     about this class

04:30.070 --> 04:33.138
        is the eggs over.
        (LAUGHS)

04:34.008 --> 04:37.042
    All right, the fact that
    none of you are cracking up
    right now

04:37.044 --> 04:38.243
     just shows your ignorance.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.879
 First assignment, lasagna.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.116
 This will be the greatest
 challenge of your young lives.

04:44.118 --> 04:46.451
 But my mom makes lasagna
 all the time.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.586
 Is it really that hard?

04:47.588 --> 04:49.721
         Uh, I don't know,
         Ruben Amaro Jr.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.790
        Does four layers
        of hand-rolled noodles,

04:51.792 --> 04:55.093
      freshly stewed tomatoes,
      and six imported cheeses
      sound hard to you?

04:55.095 --> 04:58.797
 But I only know two
 different types of cheese,
 string and whiz.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.233
          Goat, Gruyere, gouda.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.902
        Those are just the G's.
        You want me to go on?

05:03.904 --> 05:04.903
      Mom, you can't do this.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.640
       Oh, I just did.
       You're in my house now.

05:08.642 --> 05:12.577
        In addition
        to our regular house,
        which is also my house.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.914
  ADULT ADAM: <i> As Erica's plans</i>
<i> for senior year were</i>
<i> crumbling,</i>

05:15.916 --> 05:17.683
 <i> my year was shaping up</i>
 <i> to be epic.</i>

05:17.685 --> 05:19.685
 Dude. Ms. Cinoman
 just posted the cast list.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.888
 I'm The Phantom!
 The lead. Was there any doubt?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.656
       No one likes a diva,
       Dave Kim.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.191
      Oh,
      did you see what I got?

05:26.193 --> 05:27.459
            A lifetime of pain.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.761
         Give it up now
         or be a loser forever.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.430
   Oh, my God!
   I got Christine!

05:31.432 --> 05:32.698
            Whoa, whoa.
            Hold up!

05:32.700 --> 05:34.132
     Since when do you do
     the school musical?

05:34.134 --> 05:35.734
  Since it became
<i> Phantom of the Opera.</i>

05:35.736 --> 05:38.670
       But I thought
       we shared the same
       beliefs and core values,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.305
           mainly that theater
           was super lame.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.908
 It is, except <i> Phantom</i>
 being the one exception

05:42.910 --> 05:45.977
 because it's romantic
 and full of candelabras.

05:45.979 --> 05:46.778
    And guess what?
    You're Raoul.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.716
    Wait, are you sure it's not
    the other Adam Goldberg?
    He's an actor, too.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.050
    There's an "F."
    It's Adam F!

05:52.052 --> 05:55.153
  My first big part!
  Suck it, other Adam Goldberg!

05:55.155 --> 05:57.756
    Don't tell him I said that.
    I fear him. But yes!

05:57.758 --> 05:59.591
 Yeah, we're like
 the power couple of the show.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.660
                   What?
    It's acting.
    Don't make this weird.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.662
   Yay,<i> Phantom!</i>
   (SQUEALS LIGHTLY)

06:04.732 --> 06:06.565
       (SIGHS) She was supposed
       to come over

06:06.567 --> 06:07.899
       and watch me provoke
       those hornets!

06:07.901 --> 06:09.067
 Can you believe this?
                      Kind of.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.535
     It's Andrew Lloyd Webber's
     opus.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.203
 What are
 you talking about?

06:11.205 --> 06:14.206
 Haven't you heard the original
 West End cast recording?

06:14.208 --> 06:14.773
                  Dude.
                          Dude.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.609
    The Phantom loved Christine
    so much, he let her go.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.610
                You know,
                if I were you,

06:18.612 --> 06:20.011
          I'd be worried
          about a showmance.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.646
                  Oh, for sure.
                No doubt.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.647
 What's a showmance?

06:22.649 --> 06:24.116
           It's when people
           play lovers onstage,

06:24.118 --> 06:25.951
      and it leads to chemistry
      offstage, too.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.120

       We saw the musical <i> Hair.</i>
       We went for the nudity,

          Yeah you're literally
          sweating it.

06:41.135 --> 06:41.433
       You are!

06:41.435 --> 06:45.637
 Anyhow, I'm gonna go change
 my shirt and pop by rehearsal
 for the fun of it.

 Yeah, it's like a gland issue.

  I hate to do this,

      to karate kick your face.
      You get it.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.940
      It's cool.
      He's not show folk.

07:21.942 --> 07:22.874
  He doesn't understand
  our ways.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.545
 You see, the massage circle
 is a staple of
 high school drama.

         and girlfriend kissing

              Throw this thing
              in the trash?
              For sure.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.407
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> With that, Erica blew off</i>
  <i> her blow-off year</i>

19:36.409 --> 19:37.208
<i> to start learning from my mom.</i>

19:37.210 --> 19:40.845
   <i> But she wasn't</i>
   <i> the only one who learned</i>
   <i> something that day.</i>

19:40.847 --> 19:41.445
             Hey.

19:41.447 --> 19:44.248
 I'm Donkey Konging.
 Go away.

19:44.250 --> 19:44.649
                      I get it.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.584
  You're mad 'cause I basically
  ruined everything.

19:46.586 --> 19:50.054
 I'm mad 'cause my brother
 is a jealous lunatic.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.691
        Thing is, I'm not just
        jealous about Lainey.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.826
          It's like you're part
          of this cool world,

19:55.828 --> 19:57.428
        and I'm not good at it.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.663
               Wait.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.164
 You're jealous of me?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.532
           I guess it was
           kind of weird to see

20:01.534 --> 20:04.602
 my little nerd brother succeed
 in a place where I can't.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.237
      I could teach you
      zip, zap, zop

20:06.239 --> 20:07.905
     and maybe get you
     into the chorus.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.307
         No. That's your world.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.709
           I don't get it,
           and I don't want to.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.278
     But I got to say,
     I think it's kind of cool.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.014
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> So maybe I didn't get</i>
<i> my starring role in a musical,</i>

20:17.016 --> 20:19.917
     <i> but that night,</i>
     <i> we all came together</i>
     <i> for a meal</i>

20:19.919 --> 20:22.720
      <i> free of drama</i>
      <i> and full of love.</i>

20:22.722 --> 20:24.488
                Mmm. So cheesy.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.757
 Bevy, you've
 outdone yourself.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.959
          I had a little help.

20:27.961 --> 20:30.795
 <i> � Flowers fade</i>
 <i> The fruits of summer fade �</i>

20:30.797 --> 20:31.829
  Boopie, how's the play going?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.031
         Oh, you didn't hear?
         They canceled <i> Phantom.</i>

20:34.033 --> 20:37.101
    The school was doing
   <i> Phantom of the Opera?</i>

20:37.103 --> 20:39.904
     Stupid blow-off year
     made me miss out!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.405
  ADULT ADAM:
<i> That's the thing about family.</i>

20:41.407 --> 20:43.641
 <i> Even though you think</i>
 <i> you have nothing in common,</i>

20:43.643 --> 20:46.177
   <i> they're the people</i>
   <i> who teach you the most.</i>

20:46.179 --> 20:48.246
 Well, maybe
 they can do <i> Les Mis.</i>

20:48.248 --> 20:50.982
 I hear that's
 an amazing show.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.952
 Come on, Dan!
 Really dig in there!

20:54.954 --> 20:57.688
 I'm mostly muscle!
 How are you not getting this?

20:57.690 --> 20:58.789
   Oh, I am loving mine.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.092
 Naked Rob is really
 working out those knots.

21:01.094 --> 21:05.062
              Shh, shh, shh.
              Just let your day
              fall away, bro.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.065
        Ooh, a massage circle.
        Can I get in on this?

21:08.067 --> 21:10.134
    No one touches
    my girlfriend!

21:10.136 --> 21:13.204
 Everyone form a line,
 not a circle.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.705
      Lainey's first.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.008
 I got to be
 the masseuse
 caboose?

21:17.010 --> 21:17.642
         Screw this.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.077
 I'm telling Miss. Cinoman
 on you guys.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.749
           (APPLAUSE)
