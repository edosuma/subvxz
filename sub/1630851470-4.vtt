WEBVTT

00:18.875 --> 00:21.500
I have the Power!

01:06.666 --> 01:08.083
Get on with it.

01:10.416 --> 01:12.333
-Quiet.

01:13.750 --> 01:17.000
It's time to take back the kingdom I'm owed.

01:17.041 --> 01:22.750
Which one of them will force your hand, I wonder?

01:22.791 --> 01:23.666
Leave her alone.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.291
Use the power to heal me,

01:25.333 --> 01:27.625
or you'll need to use it to heal this one too.

01:37.958 --> 01:40.375
He-Man, don't do it!

01:40.416 --> 01:41.375
Silence!

01:42.875 --> 01:44.166
"He-Man"?

01:44.208 --> 01:46.750
Is that what you're calling yourself now?

01:46.791 --> 01:48.041
What about it?

01:48.083 --> 01:49.875
Let me guess the rest, hmm?

01:49.916 --> 01:52.333
Of course, there's Helmet Girl...

01:52.375 --> 01:53.625
Skeleton Hand.

01:53.666 --> 01:55.375
Wrench Boy.

01:56.833 --> 01:57.708
Oh, you hear that?

01:57.750 --> 01:59.583
Wow.

01:59.625 --> 02:01.708
I-I've got a cold, so you might not want my energy or whatever.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.291
Street Rat.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.708
What? No witty comeback?

02:08.750 --> 02:10.375
Trust me.

02:10.416 --> 02:13.083
Nobody wants to hear the words I'd like to say right now.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.166
And, last but not least...

02:15.208 --> 02:17.250
"Last but not least" what?

02:17.291 --> 02:18.833
Nothing.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.000
You're a talking tiger. That's--well, that's amazing.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.041
Maybe I'll just infect you all.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

02:26.416 --> 02:27.791
Please don't hurt him.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.041
I'll do it.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.500
I'll reactivate the chamber.

02:31.541 --> 02:33.125
Wise decision.

02:33.166 --> 02:37.125
Place the sword and unlock the power of Grayskull, now!

02:42.666 --> 02:44.000
So how does this work?

02:44.041 --> 02:47.125
I just hold the sword over the pit, or...

02:47.166 --> 02:48.208
Yes.

02:51.708 --> 02:56.416
And then, boom, the power turns on, we're--and we're all good?

02:56.458 --> 02:58.916
And you let my friends go, right?

02:58.958 --> 03:01.250
Yes, whatever. Just do it already.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.375
So this sword, for sure.

03:09.416 --> 03:14.458
I hold their lives in my hands, and you're toying with me right now?

03:14.500 --> 03:15.916
Absolutely not.

03:15.958 --> 03:17.958
She just needed enough time to pick the lock.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.875
Never use the same trick twice on a magician.

03:31.875 --> 03:32.666
No!

03:36.208 --> 03:37.458
I'll keep them busy.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.791
You guys get the heck out of here.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.458
The sword must be talking to the castle.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.750
Okay, sword, let's see what else this castle can do.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.833
Castle, we need a distraction!

03:56.208 --> 03:58.708
Bring the children back.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.000
Sicus ventus!

04:08.291 --> 04:10.083
Foolish child.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.000
No respect for the power he wields.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.708
Always was a bit of a spoiled brat.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.125
Any other tricks up your sleeves?

04:18.166 --> 04:20.000
I'm not wearing any!

04:21.416 --> 04:23.291
Ahh!

04:23.916 --> 04:25.375
See?

04:25.416 --> 04:27.041
Me and the Power of Grayskull have this covered.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.500
What does that even mean?

04:28.541 --> 04:32.208
You know, lightning and punches and muscles.

04:32.250 --> 04:36.708
The Power will be mine, boy, one way or another.

04:38.083 --> 04:40.083
The Power will be ours, Keldor.

04:40.125 --> 04:44.125
This isn't the kind of thing one shares.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.166
That wasn't the deal.

04:46.208 --> 04:48.458
What if it is the kind of thing you share?

04:48.500 --> 04:51.000
Remember what you guys were trying to do by the campfire?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.416
Why would that work now?

04:54.041 --> 04:56.041
You promised if we helped you--

04:56.083 --> 04:58.000
You never learn.

04:58.041 --> 04:59.208
It's sad, really.

05:00.625 --> 05:02.625
All will be well.

05:02.666 --> 05:05.583
It'll work. Trust me.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.666
Enough!

05:13.583 --> 05:17.500
I'll just take the Power through you, nephew.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.125
Back to the big room where the energy lives?

05:21.166 --> 05:23.166
Back to the big room where the energy lives.

05:47.583 --> 05:48.875
What?

05:50.916 --> 05:53.250
Grayskull wakes.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.791
Glorious!

05:56.458 --> 05:58.833
By the Power of Grayskull...

06:16.416 --> 06:19.000
I have the Power!

06:38.166 --> 06:40.458
I have the Power!

07:01.166 --> 07:03.416
I have the Power!

07:19.833 --> 07:22.708
I have the Power!

07:28.041 --> 07:30.875
Now, that's what I call a claw.

07:30.916 --> 07:33.708
Whoa!

07:36.166 --> 07:37.875
Yeah. Still fits.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.458
Look what mine does! Look!

07:44.500 --> 07:46.166
Cool.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.583
We have the Power.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.958
"We" have the Power. I like that!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.458
Thanks, I thought of it while you guys were transforming.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.166
-No!

08:03.208 --> 08:05.416
Wha--ah! Ahh!

08:05.458 --> 08:06.333
He-Man!

08:10.875 --> 08:13.916
Finally, I can free myself of this affliction

08:13.958 --> 08:16.583
and claim my rightful...

08:19.625 --> 08:23.833
Evelyn, Kronis, deal with the children.

08:23.875 --> 08:28.583
I'd like a word with my nephew alone.

08:28.625 --> 08:31.458
Oh, you're gonna pay for that.

08:40.291 --> 08:42.250
I'm a Ram Ball?

08:42.291 --> 08:44.166
I'm an actual Ram Ball!

08:45.708 --> 08:47.375
Ah!

08:53.083 --> 08:55.083
She mean to do that?

08:55.125 --> 08:57.875
Of--of course she meant to do that.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.083
Yeah!

09:00.333 --> 09:02.250
You are still somewhat outnumbered.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.083
Not for long.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.708
Animatum obumbratio!

09:11.791 --> 09:13.250
--Ahh!

09:13.291 --> 09:14.541
Oh, great.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.083
Two giant cats.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.375
-What is this witchcraft? -

09:29.666 --> 09:31.083
Ah!

09:32.625 --> 09:34.000
Do something!

09:34.041 --> 09:36.833
Use your new space-hair powers or something!

09:36.875 --> 09:38.583
-You do something! -Ahh.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.375
This one's mine.

09:41.416 --> 09:43.458
Oh, thank goodness.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.458
Get him, Talky!

09:52.916 --> 09:54.000
Ahh!

09:55.958 --> 09:57.458
Whoa.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.916
I have wings?

09:58.958 --> 10:01.041
I'm flying! Okay.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.791
I got this. Oh...

10:03.833 --> 10:06.125
F-f-f-flap your wings.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.291
Have fun, Kronis, dear.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.750
Ad caelum!

10:17.250 --> 10:20.916
Think I forgot to teach you something, apprentice.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.166
Wha--what--what--what's what?

10:23.208 --> 10:25.166
How to stay down.

10:35.541 --> 10:36.708
Nephew.

10:36.750 --> 10:38.458
Where are you?

10:45.166 --> 10:49.291
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.125
You never were good at Hide and Seek.

11:14.583 --> 11:18.541
It's only a matter of time before I find you.

11:18.583 --> 11:20.250
Then what?

11:29.250 --> 11:35.416
We have a long heart-to-heart about the nature of family and forgiveness.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.166
Ha!

11:38.666 --> 11:40.708
-Let's just hug it out instead! -

12:00.458 --> 12:02.875
Amazing.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.916
Never thought chasing my own shadow could be so much fun!

12:15.208 --> 12:17.583
Ram Ma'am needs some help!

12:17.625 --> 12:19.125
"Ram Ma'am"?

12:19.166 --> 12:21.916
Grayskull juice makes me feel all classy, I guess!

12:27.625 --> 12:29.291
Battle Cat is on the way!

12:41.625 --> 12:42.958
"Battle Cat"?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.291
Grayskull juice makes me feel less classy.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.666
Nice claws.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.250
Nice helmet.

13:00.458 --> 13:02.375
You can't hide from me forever.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.375
Not hiding.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.500
Just watching.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.500
Hmm. You seem... upset?

13:14.125 --> 13:15.791
Sacrifice. Discipline.

13:15.833 --> 13:19.250
My entire life has been dedicated to finding this castle

13:19.291 --> 13:23.666
to harness the power within, and you--you luck into it?

13:23.708 --> 13:28.791
This castle, that woman with the staff, they called out to me.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.541
They chose me,

13:30.583 --> 13:34.291
and that isn't something you can change with words, Witch.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.958
Magicis ignis!

13:45.833 --> 13:47.208
Impossible!

13:47.250 --> 13:50.833
You didn't use your hands or even words.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.416
That would make you...

13:53.958 --> 13:55.291
A Sorceress.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.916
Whoa! Whoa!

14:14.833 --> 14:16.666
Ahh!

14:16.708 --> 14:18.458
There's nowhere to run.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.125
You're all alone now.

14:20.166 --> 14:22.291
You should've stuck with me, kid.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.708
I can teach you the important stuff.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.166
Hammer twirling?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.416
Like how to fight dirty.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.416
So long, apprentice.

14:45.208 --> 14:47.166
Wha...

14:54.875 --> 14:58.333
-You can't beat me, apprentice! -

14:58.375 --> 15:00.583
Maybe, maybe not...

15:01.916 --> 15:03.750
Huh?

15:03.791 --> 15:06.958
But at least now I have a tool that works as fast as my mind does.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.166
I was a Royal Weapons Master to the King!

15:10.208 --> 15:12.791
A Man-At-Arms to all Eternos!

15:12.833 --> 15:14.916
-Yeah? Well... -

15:17.041 --> 15:20.291
I think I just got promoted to Man-At-Arms for Castle Grayskull.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.666
So...

15:25.750 --> 15:27.583
I quit!

15:29.041 --> 15:30.125
You guys good?

15:31.541 --> 15:34.041
Any bright ideas, Battle Cat?

15:35.666 --> 15:39.416
-Release it. -Then it'll come back after you.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.583
I'm counting on it.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.000
Yep. Yeah. You're good.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.083
I'm good, too, so... no worries.

16:05.166 --> 16:09.250
The Power in these walls will be mine to command!

16:09.291 --> 16:11.041
Grayskull doesn't want you.

16:12.666 --> 16:17.083
And so it chose to--to ruin me out of spite?

16:20.791 --> 16:23.750
-You did that to yourself. -

16:23.791 --> 16:26.500
You know how Grayskull brought out the best in my friends?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.666
I think it brought out the worst in you!

16:45.666 --> 16:46.958
--Ahh!

16:49.666 --> 16:52.333
You think you know how everything works.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.166
You're just as arrogant as your father!

16:56.791 --> 16:59.083
I'll have to take your word for it.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.000
Ahh!

17:15.416 --> 17:16.791
Did I miss anything cool?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.458
So much cool.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.916
We all did quite well.

17:20.958 --> 17:23.958
What do we do with these three?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Do you think this place has a dungeon?

17:26.041 --> 17:28.541
I bet it's really big or really weird.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.416
Probably big and weird.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.500
-Yeah. -You were wrong.

17:33.916 --> 17:36.833
Grayskull brought out the best in me.

17:36.875 --> 17:41.500
My best is just a little different than yours, nephew.

17:41.541 --> 17:42.708
Ah!

17:51.708 --> 17:54.541
I think the kid broke my jaw.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.166
I recommend a hasty exit before you lose anything else.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.333
No, stop!

18:00.375 --> 18:01.333
Adam, no!

18:01.375 --> 18:02.750
You can't save him.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.583
No!

18:29.125 --> 18:30.958
Ah! What a world!

18:45.125 --> 18:46.208
Hmm.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.041
What just happened to them?

18:49.083 --> 18:52.625
I think... we won.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.833
Then why doesn't it feel like it?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.666
Aww.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.333
How are we... alive?

19:15.375 --> 19:19.416
I used the Havoc to save you.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.000
We should get you back into one of those stasis shells

19:22.041 --> 19:24.833
before that... leaves a mark.

19:24.875 --> 19:30.333
As you recover, I'm sure I can discern some way to reverse your affliction.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.458
Thanks, but no.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.958
My curse is a blessing in disguise.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.166
I've been looking at everything wrong for so very long.

19:42.208 --> 19:46.375
Grayskull, the light I once sought to wield,

19:46.416 --> 19:50.875
is the tool of a soldier, one who fights at the behest of others.

19:50.916 --> 19:54.083
Havoc, on the other hand...

19:56.500 --> 19:59.750
From the ruins of this fallen kingdom,

19:59.791 --> 20:03.875
from where the Snakes failed to bring Ancient Eternia to its knees,

20:03.916 --> 20:08.500
I will usher in an era of brimstone and blight

20:08.541 --> 20:13.541
that will bless the modern age and all ages yet to come

20:13.583 --> 20:18.041
with the purity... of... Havoc!

20:19.500 --> 20:23.125
The time of Grayskull has passed.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.416
Welcome...

20:27.458 --> 20:33.375
to the age of Skeletor!

20:44.666 --> 20:46.958
Adam?

20:47.000 --> 20:51.416
We just wanted to make sure you were... okay after--

20:51.458 --> 20:54.416
After watching the first living relative I've ever known

20:54.458 --> 20:57.833
vaporize himself and his minions?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.875
Yes, exactly that.

21:04.750 --> 21:08.583
I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about any of this.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.250
We all have this Power now.

21:13.291 --> 21:15.541
What are we supposed to do with it?

21:15.583 --> 21:18.583
A question for the ages, Champions.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.666
Told ya this place was haunted.

21:20.708 --> 21:23.166
You're the woman from the statues.

21:23.208 --> 21:25.083
The voice in my head.

21:25.125 --> 21:28.625
What you do with it is for you to decide and discover.

21:28.666 --> 21:33.500
To know oneself is to truly become...

21:33.541 --> 21:36.083
a master of the universe.

21:41.250 --> 21:42.958
A master of the what, now?
