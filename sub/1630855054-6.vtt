[device vibrating]
[woman moaning]

00:15.849 --> 00:17.100
- [vibrator sputters]
- Ow!

00:18.393 --> 00:20.229
[coughs]

00:20.229 --> 00:21.355
What the fuck?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.608
Ow! Bitch!

00:24.608 --> 00:26.109
[vibrator sputters, stops]

00:40.999 --> 00:41.959
Are you kidding me?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.506
[sighs] Oh, my God.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.762
Ow! Uh-- Uh-- Ah.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.806
[sighs in relief]

00:57.516 --> 00:58.517
Why're you being weird?

00:58.517 --> 01:01.812
I'm not. I'm not being weird.
I'm just not being.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.647
[mouths] Ow!

01:05.774 --> 01:06.775
Um...

01:07.609 --> 01:12.447
I got a call last night inviting me back
to the land of the employed, so.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.367
Oh, is that why you brushed your hair?

01:15.367 --> 01:16.493
What? I always brush my hair.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.581
[woman moaning over speakers]

01:21.415 --> 01:22.416
Wait, who is that?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.667
[moaning over speakers continues]

01:23.667 --> 01:27.754
Wait, what is happening right now?
What is that?

01:28.714 --> 01:30.215
- God, Dad is watching porn...
- What is that?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.758
...and he doesn't know
it's on Bluetooth.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.178
What?
[moaning over speakers continues]

01:34.178 --> 01:36.263
RAE: Oh, my God.
How are you my parents?

01:37.389 --> 01:38.390
[Clare grunts]
[door shuts]

01:39.099 --> 01:40.100
Danny!

01:40.809 --> 01:42.019
- [Clare gasps]
- Shit!

01:42.019 --> 01:43.353
What are you doing?
DANNY: I'm--

01:43.937 --> 01:47.441
- What are you doing?
- [sputtering] About to get in the shower.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.734
Uh, no, you're not!

01:48.734 --> 01:50.527
I just heard what you were doing.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.071
We-- Your daughter heard
what you were doing!

01:53.071 --> 01:55.616
- What? How?
- The Bluetooth! The speakers!

01:56.909 --> 01:57.951
Oh--
CLARE: No!

01:59.244 --> 02:00.621
This is a Home Depot.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.372
You're watching
people fuck in a Home Depot?

02:02.372 --> 02:04.541
Okay, just-- Can you get out, please?
[woman moaning on video]

02:04.541 --> 02:06.293
CLARE: Do you know
that we could've been doing this?

02:06.293 --> 02:10.088
We could've been, just you and me,
this whole time, in person.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.632
I was just, like, 20 feet away.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.176
I'm just saying.

02:17.888 --> 02:18.889
GIRL:
Hey, girl.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.725
Want a ride?

02:21.725 --> 02:22.935
From you? No.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.687
Can you get in the car?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.148
Please?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.276
What?

02:31.777 --> 02:32.778
I like your jacket.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.114
Rae, what are you--

02:38.075 --> 02:39.076
Rae!

02:40.786 --> 02:43.330
Hey, what's up, Kev?
Come on in, man. Good to see you.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.584
- Hey. Kevin, right?
- Yeah.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.710
Uh, have a good one.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.337
Oh, we have therapy later.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.881
Oh, hey.
Yeah, um, about that, can we not...

02:53.882 --> 02:55.300
Can we not mention,
you know, what happened?

02:55.300 --> 02:57.553
Oh! I'm gonna lead with that,

02:57.553 --> 03:00.347
'cause every week it's about
something terrible that I have done, so...

03:00.347 --> 03:03.058
Okay, just-- I didn't do
anything terrible or wrong or--

03:03.058 --> 03:04.268
Okay.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.687
I don't like
this whole telling-the-teacher vibe
that you got going on.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.231
I'm not-- There's-- I don't have any--
[vibrator buzzing]

03:09.231 --> 03:10.941
- Excuse me.
- What is that?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.651
Is something buzzing?
[vibrator continues buzzing]

03:12.651 --> 03:15.362
No. That's not--
No, it's just the bag. There's garbage.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.531
- Wha-- Hold on.
- You're gonna go through trash right now?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.032
[vibrator continues buzzing]

03:19.032 --> 03:20.158
- [vibrator sputters, stops]
- Ooh!

03:20.993 --> 03:21.994
Died in the battlefield.

03:25.622 --> 03:26.957
CLARE: Thank you.
WOMAN: Thanks.

03:38.635 --> 03:39.928
Oh-- I'm sorry.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.606
[woman moaning on video]

03:50.606 --> 03:51.690
[thuds loudly]

03:51.690 --> 03:53.066
Are you watching porn?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
What? No. No.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.652
No, uh-huh.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.821
Oh, uh--
SHAN: Wow.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.741
So, uh, gotta take care of these.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.536
A-- A turtle just flew out of your...

04:05.287 --> 04:07.164
- something.
- Oh, that's weird.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.957
Oh, right.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.792
Uh, that was-- I bruised my--

04:10.792 --> 04:14.963
SHAN:
Um, so, were you watching porn?

04:14.963 --> 04:15.964
Uh...

04:21.053 --> 04:22.763
What can I help you with?

04:22.763 --> 04:26.308
These applicants need
their health insurance info filled out.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.018
They need a callback.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.521
Added bonus:
some of them don't have a callback number.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.607
That's great. Okay.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.984
Glad to be back?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.236
No.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.447
But, I mean, I am to a paycheck,

04:40.447 --> 04:43.075
to not lying in bed at night
worrying about mortgage payments

04:43.075 --> 04:44.785
and losing my health insurance, so--

04:44.785 --> 04:47.037
That's what
you Boomers think about in bed?

04:47.037 --> 04:48.330
Sad.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.291
I'm fucking Gen X.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.544
SHAN:
No one wants to hear who you're fucking.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.091
[car engine rumbling]

05:21.238 --> 05:22.489
Fish dumped me.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.287
And the senior guys put me fourth
on the most fuckable girls' list.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.956
Fucking fourth!

05:30.956 --> 05:32.332
Sorry for your loss.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.044
Damn.
You don't have to be so harsh about it.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.214
Your mom already went apeshit on me.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.885
God.

05:42.885 --> 05:43.886
Um...

05:44.511 --> 05:46.680
Yeah, she's, um, just going--

05:46.680 --> 05:48.182
A total psycho?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.225
Yeah.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.397
Look, by your feet.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.404
What is this?

06:03.197 --> 06:06.575
THC in a can. My mom swears by it.

06:20.964 --> 06:21.965
[sighs]

06:34.102 --> 06:35.103
WOMAN:
<i>Dear Sugar,</i>

06:35.729 --> 06:37.648
<i>I wrote to you a while ago.</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:42.569
<i>And, uh, there's this situation
that happened recently.</i>

06:42.569 --> 06:45.280
Um, I have this boyfriend.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.200
We've been seeing each other
for a while, like a year.

06:48.951 --> 06:53.080
And, uh, I don't know,
he-- he usually tells me everything,

06:53.080 --> 06:56.500
but one day, I got off of work early

06:56.500 --> 07:00.045
and, uh, I opened my bedroom door,

07:01.338 --> 07:03.257
and I saw him wearing my underwear.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.468
And now I-- I don't know what to say.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.220
Do I say something?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.055
Or ignore it?

07:11.723 --> 07:12.891
I really love him.

07:15.394 --> 07:17.187
But I don't think I like him right now.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.398
Actually, I really fucking hate him.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.900
I fucking hate you.

07:28.991 --> 07:29.992
Hey.

07:30.826 --> 07:31.827
You ready?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.915
MEL:
<i>How are you both?</i>

07:36.915 --> 07:38.792
DANNY: Great. Good.
CLARE: Fine.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.877
Good. Great.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.296
MEL:
So better than last week?

07:43.046 --> 07:44.756
- Definitely.
- Uh... I mean, it's been--

07:47.634 --> 07:49.636
Danny blasted porn
on the Bluetooth speakers this morning--

07:49.636 --> 07:52.431
Clare's vibrator
literally melted from overuse.

07:52.431 --> 07:53.599
Have you ever had a patient

07:53.599 --> 07:56.018
that's into just, like, watching

07:56.018 --> 07:58.353
average people
fuck each other's brains out...
- Wow.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.731
- ...in a hardware store?
- Uh... [scoffs]

08:00.731 --> 08:02.608
- I mean, I know it sounds niche but--
- Let's-- Okay--

08:02.608 --> 08:05.986
CLARE: What-- When you--
When you think about it, it's just like...

08:06.945 --> 08:08.697
- power tools and...
- Clare.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.407
- ...hard hats.
- Okay, I--

08:10.407 --> 08:12.242
Screws, Makitas--

08:12.242 --> 08:14.036
Okay, would you stop? Jesus!

08:14.536 --> 08:15.579
What the fuck?
MEL: Danny.

08:16.121 --> 08:16.955
I'm just--
MEL: Danny.

08:16.955 --> 08:17.956
In here?

08:18.457 --> 08:20.042
MEL: There is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.710
Stay in the room, please.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.379
[exhales deeply]

08:26.632 --> 08:27.633
[softly] Okay.

08:31.428 --> 08:32.429
MEL:
So...

08:33.722 --> 08:37.142
it seems like you're both having
individual experiences.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.810
[both chuckle]

08:38.810 --> 08:39.811
Guess so.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.772
MEL:
Mm. I know it's hard,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.483
but maybe we should
just dive right into the discussion

08:44.483 --> 08:49.238
of, like, why is it... that you two
aren't having sex with each other?

08:53.116 --> 08:56.495
I mean, we have a lot
of life stressors going on at the moment,

08:56.495 --> 08:57.496
so that kinda...

08:58.747 --> 09:00.415
saps the juice.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.042
MEL:
Like what?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.711
Um, I-- I'm back at my job.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.297
You know, the thing that, um...

09:08.757 --> 09:11.760
gives us health insurance and a 401(k).

09:11.760 --> 09:13.512
[chuckles]
Well, no word from your brother

09:13.512 --> 09:15.556
on when he's gonna pay us back. Shocker.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.057
You want to go down that road again?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.976
Have that fight again and again and again?

09:18.976 --> 09:20.769
Is that interesting?
DANNY: You know what? I'm sorry.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.523
I'm sorry that my-- my--
my endless stream of weddings

09:24.523 --> 09:27.317
and-- and teaching kids
how to play the fucking trombone

09:27.317 --> 09:28.819
doesn't come with a 401(k).

09:28.819 --> 09:30.654
I'm sorry, but it is money.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.574
And it is money that I made
that you just gave away.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.492
MEL: Clare, do you resent
having to go to the job

09:35.492 --> 09:39.162
that gives you
the health insurance, the 401(k)?

09:39.162 --> 09:42.708
Or maybe you resent Danny
for making less money than you do.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.627
No. We, um,
we made those decisions together,

09:46.712 --> 09:47.713
you know, a long time ago.

09:47.713 --> 09:50.424
- It's not like I forced her to take--
- But I still did it.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.052
I still did it.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.346
I did it so you could keep doing
what you loved.

09:58.557 --> 10:00.184
Okay, so-- so-- so what? So--

10:01.768 --> 10:02.853
[scoffs]

10:02.853 --> 10:04.146
So because you make more money than me,

10:04.146 --> 10:06.565
you just get to do whatever you want
or give it to your brother?

10:07.107 --> 10:11.945
My mom...
built that house as a fucking sanctuary

10:12.863 --> 10:14.156
against our dad.

10:14.990 --> 10:15.949
That's where she's--

10:20.287 --> 10:21.955
He knows what it means to me.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.042
You know.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.044
<i>You</i> know.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.215
You know what?
I'm gonna give you an assignment.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.427
You two need to have sex.

10:39.765 --> 10:40.766
With...

10:41.934 --> 10:42.935
Each other.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.562
Just-- Just go find a place.

10:45.562 --> 10:48.899
Just... somewhere that's not your home.

10:51.610 --> 10:52.611
[softly] Depot.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.370
[Rae chuckles]

11:03.789 --> 11:06.834
My dad's porn blasted
all over Bluetooth this morning.

11:07.793 --> 11:08.794
Gross.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.421
Mm.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.883
I literally walked in
on my dad jerking off once.

11:15.717 --> 11:19.388
He looked like a sad gorilla
wearing headphones.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.266
Yeah.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.478
Guys are so gross.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.654
Tell me something...

11:36.572 --> 11:37.656
no one knows about you.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.243
- Pass.
- Come on!

11:41.243 --> 11:43.954
Why? You wanna
humiliate me on Instagram again?

11:44.663 --> 11:45.664
No, thanks.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.795
Tell me something no one knows about you.

11:53.297 --> 11:54.298
I'm a virgin.

11:55.007 --> 11:57.593
What?
Wha-- What about Fish?

11:57.593 --> 11:59.511
MONTANA:
We talked about doing it,

11:59.511 --> 12:01.722
and... we did other stuff.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.433
And then he dumped me.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.351
[chuckling] I'm sorry, but I just--

12:06.351 --> 12:07.895
You do not act like a virgin.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.398
Hm. You mean I don't act like you?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.234
Oh. Oh, no.

12:14.985 --> 12:15.986
I'm not a virgin.

12:16.528 --> 12:17.529
MONTANA: [chuckling] Shut up!

12:18.906 --> 12:20.282
Who have you slept with?

12:20.616 --> 12:22.409
Stef Johnson.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.286
The goalie with the blue hair?

12:24.286 --> 12:25.287
Mm-hm.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.208
And, uh, Sofia Serrano.
