WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:03.875
<i>"Hey Ya"]</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:22.792
Sweetheart?

00:23.750 --> 00:24.917
Oh!

00:25.000 --> 00:28.875
Ah. I was just, uh
fixin' my hair, pop.

00:28.959 --> 00:32.291
You look different tonight.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.667
Nice, I mean.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.750
Ah, you sure Dirk's gonna be
at this party, sweetie?

00:37.834 --> 00:40.333
He's pledging the
fraternity,
pop. Course he'll be there.

00:40.417 --> 00:42.291
He hasn't been coming around
like he used to.

00:42.375 --> 00:43.583
You sure everything's
okay with him?

00:43.667 --> 00:45.291
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.625
Look, I gotta go.

00:46.709 --> 00:50.875
Oh, uh, I wanted you
to, uh, have this.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.834
It...was your mom's.

00:56.208 --> 00:59.875
You...are a young
lady now, sweetie.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.208
Okay.

01:02.291 --> 01:03.458
Um..

01:03.542 --> 01:06.959
- ...say "cheese"!
- Cheese.

01:07.041 --> 01:11.291
- It's beautiful, pop.
- Just like you.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.417
Really?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.917
You look just
like your mom.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.291
She would be so proud
of you, sweetie.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.375
(female #1)
'Help! Get me out!

02:11.500 --> 02:14.333
(Mr. Dunne)
'Laurie was in her
first year of college.'

02:14.417 --> 02:16.208
She always dreamed
of going to state.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.083
Her and her friend from
the neighborhood, Dirk

02:18.166 --> 02:20.458
that's all they
ever talked about.

02:22.041 --> 02:24.125
And this friend was
at the fraternity
party

02:24.208 --> 02:25.375
when the fire broke out?

02:25.458 --> 02:27.583
Nah, he was back at his
dorm. He'd passed out.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.500
Tied on one too many.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.208
Said Laurie was having
a real blast.

02:32.291 --> 02:34.458
She wanted to stay.

02:34.542 --> 02:36.375
It was her first party.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.417
She was so excited.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.667
Is that right?

02:39.750 --> 02:42.542
Laurie's mom died
when she was 12.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.458
Cancer.

02:45.542 --> 02:47.125
'She liked to stay
home, mostly.'

02:47.208 --> 02:50.417
Watch reruns
with her ol' pop.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.959
This fire was an
accident, Mr. Dunne. You..

02:53.041 --> 02:55.041
You know we work
homicides, right?

02:55.125 --> 02:57.375
I thought it was
an accident, too.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.375
Till I found this.

03:04.709 --> 03:06.875
It's from Laurie's e-mail.

03:06.959 --> 03:08.750
From the night of the party.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.083
It says right there
the phone it came
from.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.875
Laurie's cell phone.
She had a, uh..

03:13.959 --> 03:15.291
camera thing
a majig on it.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.333
So, she sent this
photo to herself?

03:17.417 --> 03:19.166
Yeah, mm-hm.

03:20.834 --> 03:27.083
(Rush)
'The time and date was October
23, 2004, 11:25 p.m.'

03:27.166 --> 03:28.834
'And 40 minutes later..'

03:30.083 --> 03:31.667
...my daughter was dead.

04:06.959 --> 04:08.125
(Rush)
'The fire marshal said
the blaze probably started'

04:08.208 --> 04:09.166
from a stray cigarette.

04:09.250 --> 04:10.875
No accelerants found.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.583
Cause of death was
smoke inhalation.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.959
Blood alcohol level
point-two-two.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.000
Thought dad said Laurie
wasn't a partier.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.917
She wasn't.
Straight-A
student.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.875
Latin major, a city
council summer
intern.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.500
Straight-up nerd.

04:23.583 --> 04:27.166
That amount of booze would've
knocked her flat on her back.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.000
Everyone else
gets out but
her.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.208
Heading out?

04:30.291 --> 04:32.250
Early bird
catches
the slime bag.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.625
Who you starting with?

04:33.709 --> 04:35.959
Dirk Bryant, fellow freshman,
gamma rho pledge.

04:36.041 --> 04:38.834
Claims he left the house
an hour before the fire
started.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.875
Dad said he and this
Laurie were friends.

04:40.959 --> 04:42.375
Since childhood.
Best buddies.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.709
We'll check in with av.

04:43.792 --> 04:45.417
See how they're doing
on our laptop photo.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.834
Who's coming
to first
Thursdays?

04:46.917 --> 04:48.625
- I'm in.
- Ditto.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.375
What's first
Thursdays?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.041
We taking your
ride or mine?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.583
Mine. Catch you later.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.208
Think he's warming
up to me.

05:06.709 --> 05:09.834
Looks like you got
a crush on the new girl.

05:09.917 --> 05:13.333
Yeah, cupid
pierced
my heart.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.709
- Oh, this our guy?
- Yeah.

05:19.125 --> 05:20.458
Dirk Bryant?

05:21.750 --> 05:22.875
Yeah?

05:22.959 --> 05:26.208
Philly homicide.
Detective Rush,
Vera.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.208
Homicide?

05:28.291 --> 05:29.625
You're kidding, right?

05:29.709 --> 05:31.375
You know anything
about this, Dirk?

05:32.792 --> 05:35.166
Picture sent from Laurie
Dunne's
cell phone night she died.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.750
From inside
your fraternity house.

05:36.834 --> 05:39.417
We're wondering who might
have done this. Any ideas?

05:39.500 --> 05:41.583
- No way.
- Sure about that?

05:41.667 --> 05:44.417
Look, I was bombed out
of my skull that night.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.250
I went back to my
dorm room, passed out.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.542
My roommate can
back that up.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.291
When's the last time
you saw Laurie?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.417
At the party.
She wanted to stay.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.750
She was drinking,
having a ball.

05:53.834 --> 05:56.083
- Yeah. Sure looks like it.
- Listen.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.417
I didn't even invite her to
that party in the first
place.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.792
What do you mean?

06:00.959 --> 06:03.333
Laurie basically
invited herself.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.125
You want to be a
gamma rho brother.

06:07.208 --> 06:10.250
You talk, walk,
blink and
breathe

06:10.333 --> 06:12.542
when we say you do.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.458
- You get me, pledges?
- Sir, yes, sir.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.500
'You.'

06:18.583 --> 06:19.709
'Sit down.'

06:24.625 --> 06:25.834
Eat.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.834
No hands.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.792
Hiya, Dirk.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.458
'What are you doing?'

06:39.542 --> 06:42.458
Aren't you going to introduce
your friend, Dirk?

06:42.542 --> 06:45.917
Um, this is Laurie.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.917
- And that's, uh...
- My friend, Deidre.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.166
- We met in foreign film
club.
- Hi.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.583
I'm gonna go
sit over
there.

06:55.667 --> 06:58.166
Um, so anyway,
this Saturday night

06:58.250 --> 07:00.875
the film club's showing
a Bergman double feature

07:00.959 --> 07:04.041
<i>Autumn sonata</i>
<i>Cries and whispers.</i>

07:04.125 --> 07:05.625
Be there or be square.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.375
Wanna come?
Old time's sake?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.917
Unfortunately, Dirk is
committed that night.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.417
It's alum weekend and the house
is throwing a party.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.166
Everyone's invited.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.583
Dirk didn't invite you?

07:23.291 --> 07:24.834
Um..

07:24.917 --> 07:26.417
I guess I forgot.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.750
I accept the invitation.

07:28.834 --> 07:30.917
Film club, what film club?

07:33.250 --> 07:35.166
It's gonna be
mad fun, Laurie.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.375
Bring your cute friend, too.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.500
Laurie kinda jumped the gun.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.709
So this friend of Laurie's
was at the party, too?

07:47.792 --> 07:48.834
Yeah.

07:48.917 --> 07:51.375
Know where we
can find her?

07:51.458 --> 07:54.542
Uh, Laurie and I
kinda drifted apart here.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.917
I didn't know her
friends,
she didn't know mine.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.458
How'd Laurie take it,
your drifting apart.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.583
Things change.
What're you gonna do?

08:02.667 --> 08:04.542
You mean you changed.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.625
That a crime?

08:06.709 --> 08:09.750
Wanting the highlight of my
Saturday night to be more than

08:09.834 --> 08:12.333
reading foreign
film subtitles?

08:16.375 --> 08:19.166
So, um..

08:19.250 --> 08:20.834
you're pretty young
to make homicide.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.000
I'm 28.

08:22.083 --> 08:25.542
Yeah, but you got
your family connection.

08:25.625 --> 08:27.583
How old were you?

08:27.667 --> 08:31.125
I was practically 29.

08:32.959 --> 08:35.750
Sure, I remember
those bozo frat boys.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.500
Real jerks.

08:41.834 --> 08:44.834
You see anything at
the party you want to share?

08:44.917 --> 08:46.750
Anything like what?

08:49.250 --> 08:50.625
Like this.

08:50.709 --> 08:53.750
Could be what happened
to Laurie wasn't an accident.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.875
Anything you want to share now?

08:55.959 --> 08:58.583
She was your friend,
Deidre. Help us out here.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.583
They blindfolded us.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.208
What?

09:06.291 --> 09:08.083
The minute we went in

09:08.166 --> 09:10.041
they said we couldn't see

09:10.125 --> 09:12.917
where their stupid
secret room was.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.291
Where the real party
would take place.

09:16.291 --> 09:17.959
'Only brothers could.'

09:18.041 --> 09:20.291
And you went along
with this.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.792
I bought a new
dress
for this party.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.834
What happened after they
blindfolded you?

09:25.917 --> 09:28.291
The fun and games began.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.000
["Ska8er boi"

09:51.125 --> 09:53.208
- Why they gotta be
blindfolded?
- You know the rules.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.834
<i>The Pen</i>
is.
- The pen?

09:55.917 --> 09:57.875
That's what we call
our party room, darlin'.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.667
It's okay, Dirk.
It's kind of fun.

10:00.750 --> 10:03.000
- You sure you're okay,
Laurie?
- Yeah.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
The

10:08.750 --> 10:10.333
Can I take off
my blindfold now?

10:10.417 --> 10:11.750
Oh, no, no.
Not just yet, hon.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.583
We got to introduce you
formally first.

10:13.667 --> 10:17.041
- Think cotillion.
- Cotillion? What's that?

10:17.125 --> 10:19.250
Shh! May I present..

10:19.333 --> 10:22.709
Miss Deidre Miller, gentlemen!

10:23.792 --> 10:25.166
Come on, step up,
honey.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.834
Just got a little platform
for your presentation.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.583
- Whoopsie daisy!
- Manny, this isn't right.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.792
Alright.

10:37.166 --> 10:41.083
And last, but not least,
may I present...

10:41.166 --> 10:43.458
Miss Laurie Dunne!

10:47.166 --> 10:49.250
Step up again.

10:54.125 --> 10:57.000
You can take the blindfolds
off now, ladies.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.041
Oink! Oink!

11:06.375 --> 11:09.959
Damn, girl!
You tipped the scale!

11:11.667 --> 11:15.458
Gamma rho dubs you,
Miss Laurie Dunne

11:15.542 --> 11:17.000
Queen of the porkers!

11:17.083 --> 11:19.417
[everyone]
Hog, hooray! Whoo!

11:19.500 --> 11:22.041
Welcome to
the pig pen, porkies!

11:24.500 --> 11:27.750
Get your fat asses back in
here.
The party's just started.

11:28.625 --> 11:29.583
(Dirk)
'I didn't know.'

11:29.667 --> 11:32.250
Laurie, I didn't.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.792
Whoa. We're not done with you
yet little piggy.

11:34.875 --> 11:36.458
No! Stop it!

11:38.375 --> 11:41.333
- We all got out of there.
- Except for Laurie.

11:42.583 --> 11:45.375
So why the big secret,
Deidre?

11:45.458 --> 11:49.583
Would you want the world
to know what they did to you?

11:49.667 --> 11:53.000
I'm sorry about
what
happened to Laurie

11:53.083 --> 11:54.542
but it was an accident.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.000
Some accident.

12:06.125 --> 12:07.166
So, our prince charming's
put those poor girls

12:07.250 --> 12:08.625
on display for laughs.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.709
Laurie's friend, Dirk, he was
a part of this ruse, too?

12:10.792 --> 12:12.125
The kid was a lowly pledge.

12:12.208 --> 12:13.500
Seemed clueless to
what was going down.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.667
He's Gamma rho, faithful
to the brotherhood

12:15.750 --> 12:17.083
so let's go back
for round two.

12:17.166 --> 12:19.083
Meantime, what do you know
about this Manny?

12:19.166 --> 12:23.291
College boy. Did six months in
county for aggravated assault.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.417
Beating on some townies.
On probation now.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.959
Vera and Valens
are having a talk.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.125
Lieutenant?

12:29.208 --> 12:31.458
You find anything
on that laptop, Naya?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.041
We blew up your
victim's photo.

12:33.125 --> 12:34.917
Guy with the bottle's got
a fraternity ring.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.083
- Gamma rho insignia.
- Graduation year 1973.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.375
Making our boy
what, mid-50s?

12:40.458 --> 12:42.458
Middle aged and
partying
with college kids?

12:42.542 --> 12:44.000
That's aging graceful.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.208
What's with the gemstones?

12:45.291 --> 12:46.583
Well, maybe he's
a varsity athlete.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.750
Gamma rho's known
for its crew types.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.000
'93 grad myself.

12:50.083 --> 12:52.333
So one stone for
every varsity year?

12:52.417 --> 12:54.000
I'll give the athletic
department a call.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.500
Match a '73 grad who had
three years of varsity

12:56.583 --> 12:58.667
with our Gamma rho
alum lists.

12:58.750 --> 13:02.333
Maybe we find
our party boy.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.750
- This Gamma rho?
- Sir, yes, sir!

13:16.083 --> 13:18.291
We're looking
for a Herman Jones.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.125
Please step inside, sirs!

13:24.417 --> 13:27.834
Sir? Guests for you, sir!

13:27.917 --> 13:29.250
(Valens)
'Herman Jones?'

13:31.166 --> 13:33.709
What's it to you?

13:33.792 --> 13:36.709
- And it's Manny.
- Yeah, whatever.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.333
Philly PD.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.750
Quit gawking, Pledge.
Get out of here.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.166
He's cute.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.083
French maids do it
for me, too.

13:48.166 --> 13:52.542
How we discipline the newbies,
break 'em down.

13:52.625 --> 13:56.125
- And you are?
- Detective Valens, Vera.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.250
Got some questions about
the night Laurie Dunne died.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.792
Well, fire away.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.500
So to speak.

14:03.583 --> 14:06.959
Heard about your hogscale
party.
Class act there, Herman.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.250
Not my fault
the heifer had dreams.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.417
Dreams?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.625
Of being a Gamma rho
booty call.

14:16.709 --> 14:18.417
Hey, Scotty, you know
Jimmy Davis?

14:18.500 --> 14:20.917
(Valens)
'It's a probation officer.
Sure.'

14:21.000 --> 14:22.166
He and I went
to the academy together.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.417
We're kind of like brothers.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.083
Davis knows I been
dotting my "I"s.

14:25.166 --> 14:26.875
Maybe Jimmy finds out
you missed a "t"

14:26.959 --> 14:28.625
tosses your ass in county.

14:28.709 --> 14:31.291
You get to play
French maid for the cons.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.291
So, what happened
after you dragged Laurie

14:38.375 --> 14:39.750
<i>The Pen?</i>

14:41.375 --> 14:44.291
It was a joke, okay?

14:44.375 --> 14:46.625
I didn't do anything
to that pork pie.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.417
Tell us about it.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.083
Girlfriend went ballistic.

14:51.959 --> 14:54.875
Whoa, whoa, we're not done
with you yet, little piggy!

15:02.041 --> 15:04.333
You four-eyed loser!

15:04.417 --> 15:06.750
That's what the jocks used
to call you in high school!

15:06.834 --> 15:09.792
- Or don't you remember?
- For real?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.417
I'm not talking to you,
so shut the hell up!

15:12.500 --> 15:14.000
(frat boys)
Whoa!

15:16.125 --> 15:20.417
You think getting contacts
changes who you were?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.083
Makes you their friend now?

15:23.166 --> 15:25.667
Their brother?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.542
You used to hate
guys like this.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.625
Guys who beat you up
in gym class every day.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.667
You were better than them.

15:35.750 --> 15:39.500
'Cause you didn't need
to make others feel small.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.083
To feel real.

15:42.458 --> 15:44.667
But you know what?

15:44.750 --> 15:47.041
You're that guy now, Dirk.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.250
You're that guy.

16:06.291 --> 16:08.041
I know who you are.

16:11.208 --> 16:13.291
(Laurie)
'Deidre?'

16:13.375 --> 16:15.583
'What happened?'

16:15.667 --> 16:17.375
Let's get out of here.

16:27.959 --> 16:30.750
Like I said,
fatty got emotional.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.166
So, Deidre was
still in the house?

16:33.250 --> 16:35.709
Whatever.
Yes. So what?

16:35.792 --> 16:37.291
What did Laurie mean by

16:37.375 --> 16:39.500
"I know who you are"
to the older guy?

16:39.583 --> 16:41.458
Who the hell knows?
It was alum weekend.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.333
Lot of people were there.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.625
I don't know who
the old warthog
was.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.583
(Josie)
'Why'd you lie, Deidre?'

16:51.667 --> 16:55.041
And say you left when you
were still in the house?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.417
Tell 'em, Deidre.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.542
Someone should know
what happened to you.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.875
I bought
that new
dress..

17:06.291 --> 17:07.750
...and he ripped it.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.166
Who did?

17:13.208 --> 17:14.917
I need to make a call.

17:17.458 --> 17:19.709
Who hurt you, Deidre?

17:19.792 --> 17:21.417
It was dark.

17:23.667 --> 17:27.583
I was trying to find
my way out of that house.

17:27.667 --> 17:32.250
But there were
so many rooms.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.041
'And then someone
just grabs me'

17:34.125 --> 17:38.417
'from out of nowhere
and rips my dress.'

17:38.500 --> 17:41.458
It was over before
I could even scream.

17:42.959 --> 17:46.291
I tried to find my way
out of
that house but I
couldn't.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.792
And that's when Laurie
found you in that hallway.

17:48.875 --> 17:52.417
Laurie got me
out of that house.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.291
But then she turned traitor.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.917
- Are you okay, Deidre?
- No. She's not okay.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.583
(Dirk)
'Laurie?'

18:04.667 --> 18:06.917
Can I talk to you, please?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.291
Get away from
us,
you jerk!

18:08.375 --> 18:10.166
I didn't know they were
gonna do that! I swear!

18:10.250 --> 18:13.667
(Deidre)
'You're pathetic. If you
listen
to one word he says.'

18:13.750 --> 18:15.166
How could you
not know, Dirk?

18:15.250 --> 18:17.166
- They don't tell pledges.
- Yeah, right!

18:17.250 --> 18:18.959
I'd never let you come
if I knew!

18:19.041 --> 18:21.875
- You're a lying piece of crap!
- Give me two minutes, Laurie.

18:21.959 --> 18:23.542
Please, I have
to talk to you!

18:23.625 --> 18:25.125
(Deidre)
She doesn't care
what you have to say!

18:25.208 --> 18:29.500
- Deidre, he's my friend.
- Don't you get it?

18:29.583 --> 18:32.709
You're nothing to him!

18:32.792 --> 18:35.542
I want to hear
what he has to say.

18:49.542 --> 18:50.959
What did you do?

18:52.625 --> 18:54.542
(Shirley)
We went straight home.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.000
We tried to pretend
it never happened.

18:57.917 --> 18:59.375
Jo?

18:59.458 --> 19:00.959
Got something.

19:06.417 --> 19:07.834
Just talked
to Stillman.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.041
I.D'd the guy in the
picture
shoving the tequila

19:10.125 --> 19:11.458
bottle down
Laurie's
throat.

19:11.542 --> 19:14.375
- The Gamma rho alum?
- Mm-hmm. Class of '73.

19:14.458 --> 19:16.250
Three years varsity crew.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.625
One guy makes the grade.

19:17.709 --> 19:18.917
You're not going to
believe who it is.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.542
Don't keep me hanging.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.709
The name John Avery
ring a bell?

19:23.792 --> 19:26.333
City councilman,
John Avery?

19:26.417 --> 19:27.709
Bingo.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.959
A rumor has it, this
councilman
Avery's a real hound dog.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.083
Can't keep his paws off
the female interns.

19:40.166 --> 19:42.250
That's how Laurie knew him,
her summer internship.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.083
And in October of 2004

19:44.166 --> 19:46.750
Avery was in the middle
of a re-election
campaign.

19:46.834 --> 19:49.250
If his joining in the Gamma
rho
activities ever came to light

19:49.333 --> 19:50.959
he'd be kissing
his career bye-bye.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.917
So, maybe Laurie's death
wasn't accidental.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.542
Maybe the fire
was a cover-up.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.083
Lot of maybes, too many
for us to make that sort of

19:57.166 --> 19:58.417
accusation against
a councilman.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.333
What if Dirk gave us
a positive I.D on him?

20:01.417 --> 20:02.917
Good luck
getting
any cooperation

20:03.000 --> 20:04.333
from your frat boys.

20:04.417 --> 20:05.250
Why?

20:05.333 --> 20:07.333
Gamma rho's closing ranks.

20:07.417 --> 20:08.709
Slimebag lawyer
just got involved.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.417
- Oh.
- That was quick.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.125
Apparently that psycho kid,
Manny, me and Scotty talked to

20:13.208 --> 20:15.000
went squealing to
his brothers right after.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.125
Great.

20:16.208 --> 20:17.792
Laurie's dad mentioned
some kind of letter

20:17.875 --> 20:20.834
the councilman sent him,
right after she died.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.667
Could be Doer's
remorse?

20:27.917 --> 20:29.417
What's councilman
Avery's
letter got to do

20:29.500 --> 20:30.500
with what happened
to Laurie?

20:30.583 --> 20:31.917
We need to look
at everything.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.500
Part of the job,
Mr. Dunne.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.041
Avery ever reach out to you
again, after sending the
letter?

20:36.125 --> 20:38.875
No. I-I don't know,
not that I can recall.

20:38.959 --> 20:40.375
What about Dirk?

20:40.458 --> 20:42.542
Dirk? What about him?

20:42.625 --> 20:44.792
He keep in touch?

20:44.875 --> 20:47.083
Comes over for a meal
once a week.

20:47.166 --> 20:51.583
We, uh, watch some TV,
talk. It's nice.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.250
'Him come over
like that, it's..'

20:54.333 --> 20:55.542
Keeps my mind off things.

20:55.625 --> 20:56.750
(Jeffries)
'Admirable.'

20:56.834 --> 20:59.542
Especially from someone
as young as he.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.834
He's a special kid.

21:02.917 --> 21:05.041
Why are you asking
about him?

21:05.125 --> 21:08.125
Dirk and Laurie, you knew they
were growing apart at college.

21:08.208 --> 21:09.542
What's your meaning?

21:09.625 --> 21:13.125
He had a whole other crowd
he was trying to get in with.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.083
No. You
don't
know him.

21:18.750 --> 21:22.667
The day I told Laurie that..

21:22.750 --> 21:25.959
...her mom wasn't coming
back from the hospital..

21:26.041 --> 21:28.000
...not one tear.

21:28.083 --> 21:31.166
Not that day. Not ever.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.834
Brave girl.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.166
12 years old.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.417
Only thing holding me
down to earth.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.834
Is that right?

21:38.917 --> 21:40.500
One night, I can't sleep.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.750
I come down here..

21:43.834 --> 21:46.500
...and I hear
my daughter crying.

21:46.583 --> 21:50.041
'That's when I see Dirk.
Just a kid, too.'

21:50.125 --> 21:52.208
Got Laurie in his arms.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.667
And that's when I knew..

21:54.750 --> 21:57.083
...he was the only thing..

21:57.166 --> 21:59.542
...holding her down to earth.

22:03.083 --> 22:06.041
So...you want tell me

22:06.125 --> 22:09.125
what happened to my girl now?

22:09.208 --> 22:12.125
What makes you ask
me about Dirk?

22:18.709 --> 22:20.208
Nice kid.

22:20.291 --> 22:22.417
Spending time with
the dead friend's father.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.500
- That's commitment.
- Or guilt.

22:25.583 --> 22:27.041
My lawyer said you
can't talk to me.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.166
From the minute your, uh,
brother Manny knows

22:29.250 --> 22:31.500
we're opening this case,
he tells everyone.

22:31.583 --> 22:34.792
You knew way before Manny did,
and you never told a soul.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.834
Why'd you bring Laurie
back into that house?

22:37.917 --> 22:40.333
'Cause she bitch-slapped you
in front of your boys?

22:40.417 --> 22:42.083
Maybe you were looking
to settle the score.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.250
Or maybe you were
following orders.

22:44.333 --> 22:47.458
Laurie recognizes councilman
Avery, leaves him no choice.

22:47.542 --> 22:50.458
He sends his errand boy
to bring her back.

22:50.542 --> 22:52.750
Nobody made me do
anything that
night.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.375
No one but me.

22:59.875 --> 23:04.000
So, what's so important
you want talk to me about?

23:04.083 --> 23:08.125
- I'm sorry.
- That's it?

23:08.208 --> 23:11.792
That's all you have
to say for yourself?

23:11.875 --> 23:13.667
That's not good enough.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.750
In your kitchen..

23:18.750 --> 23:22.500
...after your mom died.

23:22.583 --> 23:23.834
What?

23:25.709 --> 23:28.875
I remember watching
you cry.

23:28.959 --> 23:31.166
Why are you telling me this?

23:31.250 --> 23:33.291
And I remember..

23:33.375 --> 23:36.583
...thinking we were just 12.
You know?

23:38.458 --> 23:42.959
But that was over,
being kids.

23:43.875 --> 23:46.291
'Cause that night..

23:46.375 --> 23:51.000
...I knew I had to be the
one
person you could always..

23:51.083 --> 23:52.667
...count on.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.500
You always were.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.583
Not tonight.

24:04.709 --> 24:07.458
<i>["Here without you"</i>
"3 doors down"

24:26.959 --> 24:29.041
What the hell's going on?

24:34.291 --> 24:36.375
You boinking the oink, Dirk?

24:36.458 --> 24:38.834
- Let's get of here.
- Dudes!

24:40.083 --> 24:41.709
Dirk's rounded up
our little porker!

24:41.792 --> 24:45.583
- Hey, don't call her that.
- Shut up, dork boy.

24:45.667 --> 24:46.834
- Come on.
- Stop that.

24:46.917 --> 24:49.208
Hey! You leave her alone!

24:49.291 --> 24:50.542
Dirk!

24:52.458 --> 24:54.041
<i>The Pen.</i>

24:54.125 --> 24:55.875
Time for the greased
pig contest.

24:55.959 --> 24:59.166
No! Stop it!
Dirk!

25:00.000 --> 25:01.208
(Dirk)
'Laurie!'

25:16.583 --> 25:19.417
And you call these
guys your brothers?

25:19.500 --> 25:20.875
They're not
always
like that.

25:20.959 --> 25:24.375
So, Councilman Avery's
in the house.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.709
So what'd you do,
after that?

25:29.792 --> 25:31.375
Like I said,
I went back to my
dorm.

25:31.458 --> 25:35.542
Didn't occur to you to call
the cops, go for help?

25:35.625 --> 25:38.917
I was out of it.
Didn't know what to do.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.750
Friend like you..

25:40.834 --> 25:42.917
...who needs enemies.

25:52.083 --> 25:55.667
(Stillman)
'The meet with Avery's set
for tomorrow morning.'

25:55.750 --> 25:58.333
The guy has no idea how
you're
going to rock his world.

25:58.417 --> 26:01.208
I'd pay good money to be
a fly on that wall.

26:01.291 --> 26:03.375
Good work today,
guys. Good night.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.834
'Good night, boss.'

26:05.917 --> 26:09.041
Older, powerful men like
Avery, they can be a bitch.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.417
What do you mean?

26:12.500 --> 26:14.500
Nothing.

26:14.583 --> 26:16.792
So what's first Thursdays?

26:16.875 --> 26:19.709
Uh, Jones Tavern, first
Thursday of the month.

26:19.792 --> 26:24.083
Homicide detectives boozing
it up, swapping war stories.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.166
- You want to join?
- Nah.

26:26.250 --> 26:30.000
I'm not one for mixing
work
with the personal myself.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.625
Oh, me neither.

26:32.709 --> 26:35.000
Did that once before.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.166
It was a big mistake.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.291
Yeah?

26:38.375 --> 26:41.709
Meaning, I'd understand if..

26:41.792 --> 26:44.709
...you found yourself
in a similar situation.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.667
Your old boss,
Sergeant White--

26:46.750 --> 26:48.458
Anyway, this is me.

26:50.583 --> 26:53.125
- Nice ride.
- Yeah.

26:53.208 --> 26:55.375
It has four doors.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.000
Good night, Scotty.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.375
Laurie Dunne was a summer
intern in my office.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.583
Sweet girl.

27:12.625 --> 27:15.250
A terrible accident,
that fire.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.208
The thing is, councilman

27:19.291 --> 27:23.208
we're not convinced
it was an accident.

27:23.291 --> 27:26.250
And we know that you were
there the night she died.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.709
You're not serious, are you?

27:29.792 --> 27:31.083
We have a witness.

27:33.166 --> 27:34.542
One phone call from me, pal

27:34.625 --> 27:37.542
and you'll be running
the auto pound tomorrow.

27:42.917 --> 27:45.500
And you'll be
headline news, pal.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.500
What do you want?

27:57.583 --> 28:02.041
What'd your Gamma rho brothers
do to Laurie that night?

28:02.125 --> 28:05.583
Boys, booze and bravado,
a lethal combination.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.458
That poor girl got
caught in the
vortex.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.333
And you were just
the wide-eyed innocent

28:09.417 --> 28:10.291
watching it all go down.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.500
I had a few drinks, I admit

28:12.583 --> 28:15.834
but I knew when
enough was enough.

28:15.917 --> 28:18.417
[chanting]
Swill! Swill! Swill!

28:21.333 --> 28:24.542
Oh! Piggy got you
good, Manny!

28:24.625 --> 28:27.291
(Manny)
I'll show you
a real man, porky!

28:32.709 --> 28:33.959
She's taking pictures, dude!

28:34.041 --> 28:36.291
- Get away from me!
- She took a picture.

28:36.375 --> 28:38.792
Get away from me!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

28:38.875 --> 28:40.834
Give it back, you jerk!

28:43.083 --> 28:45.834
- She's taking pictures?
- So what?! I took care of
it!

28:45.917 --> 28:48.625
And I e-mailed it.

28:48.709 --> 28:52.041
- You stupid!
- Leave her alone, Manny!

28:52.125 --> 28:54.625
'Party's over, as of now.'

28:54.709 --> 28:57.667
Get out of here!
All of you!

28:58.417 --> 28:59.667
Go!

29:02.959 --> 29:04.333
What about her?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.083
Get her home.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.750
I don't care how.

29:21.083 --> 29:24.125
That girl was alive
when I left.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.000
She could have blackmailed
you, councilman.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.375
And you just walked away?

29:29.458 --> 29:32.083
What do you honestly
think I'd do?

29:32.166 --> 29:34.500
- Kill the girl?
- Someone did.

29:34.583 --> 29:37.166
There were witnesses
that saw me leave that house.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.834
Your fraternity
brothers, councilman?

29:38.917 --> 29:42.166
- A jury would love that.
- I'm not talking about them.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.583
Then who?

29:46.250 --> 29:47.792
Those girls.

29:48.834 --> 29:52.500
From...earlier that night.

29:52.583 --> 29:56.250
- What girls?
- From the...you know?

29:56.333 --> 29:58.000
The contest.

29:59.417 --> 30:02.417
Wait a minute. Those girls
were still in the house?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.208
In the backyard.

30:04.291 --> 30:06.542
And what were they
doing there?

30:06.625 --> 30:09.166
They were setting the fire.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.709
You and your friends
set that fire, Shirley.

30:15.792 --> 30:18.208
- That's crazy.
- We have a witness.

30:18.291 --> 30:19.750
Saw it all go down.

30:21.041 --> 30:22.875
I got your buddy, Deidre,
in the next room.

30:22.959 --> 30:25.208
She's blamin' it all on you.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.834
You're lying. She would
never do that.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.709
Oh, People do all
sorts of things

30:28.792 --> 30:30.792
lookin' at life
for murder one.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.834
Laurie stood up for you.

30:37.166 --> 30:39.667
Do the same
for her, Shirley.

30:44.291 --> 30:46.250
Those boys..

30:46.333 --> 30:47.792
...had no right..

30:47.875 --> 30:50.333
...to do what
they did to
us.

30:50.417 --> 30:53.500
- It made you mad.
- 'No.'

30:55.208 --> 30:56.333
It just..

30:58.667 --> 31:01.291
It kinda
broke
my heart.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.667
Then why burn down the house?

31:05.583 --> 31:08.000
To break theirs.

31:10.166 --> 31:11.667
(Deidre)
'I can't believe those
guy's.'

31:11.750 --> 31:14.583
- Let's go home.
- And do what?

31:14.667 --> 31:17.667
Cry ourselves to sleep
like we always do?

31:19.083 --> 31:22.291
Not after what
they did to us.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.667
- What they did to Deidre.
- So what do you suggest?

31:24.750 --> 31:28.500
Tell the whole world, so
we'll be a laughingstock?

31:28.583 --> 31:30.583
We're not gonna tell anybody.

31:30.667 --> 31:34.625
We're just going to even.

31:34.709 --> 31:37.625
Break up their stupid party.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.250
Burn the house down!

31:43.291 --> 31:44.750
I'm in.

31:51.333 --> 31:52.792
Shirley?

32:04.000 --> 32:07.041
Burn it down!

32:07.125 --> 32:09.500
Are you okay, Deidre?

32:09.583 --> 32:12.834
No, she's not okay.

32:12.917 --> 32:14.500
(Dirk)
'Laurie?'

32:14.583 --> 32:16.959
Can I talk to you please?

32:19.083 --> 32:21.500
You know the rest
of the story.

32:21.583 --> 32:25.083
Laurie went back
in the house with him.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.750
So..

32:29.041 --> 32:30.834
...maybe you figured..

32:30.917 --> 32:33.083
...the traitor
deserved
to burn up, too?

32:33.166 --> 32:34.667
No.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.750
We didn't know
what to do.

32:36.834 --> 32:38.375
We were gonna go home,
but then--

32:38.458 --> 32:39.625
Then what?

32:41.458 --> 32:43.959
You have no idea
what it's like

32:44.041 --> 32:49.375
being the punch line
to every joke, do you?

32:50.792 --> 32:54.041
Someone had to pay.

32:55.834 --> 32:59.458
Come on. We're gonna burn
this place to the ground!

32:59.542 --> 33:01.542
Not with Laurie
still in there!

33:01.625 --> 33:05.000
Who cares?
She's a traitor!

33:05.083 --> 33:07.041
They've gotta pay!

33:07.125 --> 33:09.250
For what they did to us!

33:09.959 --> 33:11.500
To me.

33:15.792 --> 33:17.750
Let's go home.

33:23.375 --> 33:25.208
Oh, my god.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.875
That's him.

33:28.959 --> 33:30.500
Oink. Oink.

33:42.792 --> 33:44.583
Deidre?

33:48.667 --> 33:50.125
Someone's..

33:51.250 --> 33:52.834
...gotta pay.

34:00.417 --> 34:01.792
Run!

34:13.750 --> 34:16.959
It spread so fast.

34:17.041 --> 34:19.959
And then everyone
was running.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.709
Screaming.

34:22.792 --> 34:25.792
All I could do was
stand there..

34:25.875 --> 34:27.166
...and watch.

34:29.542 --> 34:32.333
Why couldn't Laurie
get out?!

34:33.583 --> 34:34.625
I don't know.

34:34.709 --> 34:37.333
Everyone else got out

34:37.417 --> 34:39.834
even her friend.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.959
Her friend?

34:42.041 --> 34:43.500
Dirk.

34:44.875 --> 34:48.000
Dirk was in
the house?

34:48.083 --> 34:50.834
He was the last one out.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.333
Passed out in
your dorm room.

35:05.709 --> 35:09.000
- It's a nice story.
- Leave me alone.

35:09.083 --> 35:11.333
You were the last one
out of the house

35:11.417 --> 35:13.041
when the fire broke out.

35:14.375 --> 35:15.500
That's a lie.

35:15.583 --> 35:19.000
Ever seen an animal
trapped in a fire, Dirk?

35:19.083 --> 35:20.542
- What?
- They panic.

35:20.625 --> 35:23.166
Run in circles, scream.

35:23.250 --> 35:27.000
Horrible way to die,
horrible thing to watch.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.000
- I don't have to listen
to--
- Hey.

35:32.625 --> 35:34.542
Laurie's father saw you..

35:34.625 --> 35:37.375
...that night
in her kitchen.

35:37.458 --> 35:39.917
After her mom died.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.208
- Please stop doing this.
- He said you were her rock.

35:43.291 --> 35:45.792
The one person she could
always depend on.

35:45.875 --> 35:47.583
(Valens)
'You'd never leave Laurie.'

35:47.667 --> 35:49.417
You stayed that night.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.333
Tried to save her.

35:51.417 --> 35:53.417
(Rush)
'But you couldn't'.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.000
Could you?

35:58.041 --> 35:59.917
She made me promise.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.542
Promise what?

36:03.625 --> 36:05.500
That's why I
could
never tell.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.625
Her pop..

36:09.709 --> 36:12.667
He thinks
Laurie died..

36:12.750 --> 36:14.083
...happy.

36:15.917 --> 36:18.083
And the truth would
break his heart.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.959
Tell us the truth now.

36:28.834 --> 36:30.208
He was wrong.

36:31.667 --> 36:35.375
I wasn't Laurie's rock.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.041
She was mine.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.083
This is all
your fault, Pledge.

36:44.208 --> 36:45.458
She took pictures!

36:45.542 --> 36:47.917
They're gonna close
us down now for sure!

36:49.667 --> 36:51.125
It's over, Manny.

36:55.291 --> 36:56.792
Hey, don't touch her!

36:56.875 --> 36:58.917
You can't blink
the oink, dirk.

37:01.208 --> 37:03.333
Then I will.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.583
What's goin' on?!

37:08.667 --> 37:09.750
Dirk!

37:11.333 --> 37:13.208
Dirk.

37:13.291 --> 37:15.542
No! No!

37:15.625 --> 37:17.041
She's still in there!

37:21.542 --> 37:24.291
You a brother?
Or you a bitch?

37:24.375 --> 37:25.917
Give me the key, Manny!

37:27.375 --> 37:29.792
[Laurie screaming]
'Dirk, help me!'

37:29.875 --> 37:32.000
Get away from the door!

37:37.667 --> 37:40.166
(Laurie)
'Help me! Help me!'

37:40.250 --> 37:41.542
Get to the window!

37:41.625 --> 37:43.458
You can climb out!

37:53.917 --> 37:55.625
Get to the window!

37:56.750 --> 38:00.417
Dirk! I can't breathe!

38:06.166 --> 38:07.542
No!

38:10.333 --> 38:12.500
Keep your face
where there's air.

38:12.583 --> 38:17.667
Help! Somebody help!
Help us!

38:19.583 --> 38:21.417
Don't you let go of me.

38:25.625 --> 38:27.709
Promise.

38:27.792 --> 38:31.625
- What?
- You'll take care of my pop.

38:31.709 --> 38:34.875
Don't talk like that. They're
gonna get you outta here.

38:34.959 --> 38:38.959
Dirk, you listen to
me
and you listen
good.

38:40.166 --> 38:41.875
Don't you let him be..

38:43.834 --> 38:45.208
...alone.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.208
Promise, Dirk.

38:49.291 --> 38:50.959
Promise.

38:52.959 --> 38:54.750
I promise.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.208
Hey, hey! I won't let
you go. Do you hear me?

39:00.291 --> 39:03.875
I won't let you go!
Won't let you go.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.792
I know you won't.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.333
Laurie.

39:10.417 --> 39:11.583
Laurie!

39:12.750 --> 39:14.166
Laurie!

39:14.875 --> 39:17.041
Laurie!
