WEBVTT

00:00.047 --> 00:02.674
Who's that? Who is that?

00:02.700 --> 00:04.902
Just a patient. Road traffic accident.

00:05.206 --> 00:07.131
We're only holding two cards, Stella.

00:07.251 --> 00:10.998
One, we have him two, we
have her and she's alive,

00:11.006 --> 00:13.349
the rest is a disaster.

00:13.349 --> 00:16.109
- Do you have a friend called Daisy?
- Why?

00:16.109 --> 00:17.942
There's something about her online,

00:18.149 --> 00:19.909
how she met Daddy one time.

00:19.909 --> 00:21.709
Am I being interviewed under caution?

00:21.829 --> 00:24.669
- Yes, you are.
- I knew that Rose was in that boot

00:24.789 --> 00:26.288
and I needed to get to her.

00:26.323 --> 00:28.341
And what about Mr Spector's life?

00:28.549 --> 00:30.829
Did you not have a duty to protect that?

00:32.988 --> 00:34.541
I need some help in here!

00:34.794 --> 00:35.953
Rose, what are you doing?

00:35.957 --> 00:37.333
- I want to go home.
- You can't.

00:37.364 --> 00:38.647
I want to go home!

00:38.722 --> 00:40.254
A man has come forward

00:40.272 --> 00:42.777
having seen Spector's
photograph on the news.

00:42.827 --> 00:44.725
He says Spector looks
like a man who rents

00:44.741 --> 00:46.756
a lock-up from him in East Belfast,

00:47.050 --> 00:48.909
under the name Baldwin.

00:49.029 --> 00:51.950
We've just landed a not
uninteresting little case.

00:52.117 --> 00:53.521
The Belfast Strangler.

00:53.641 --> 00:54.692
You stay away from him!

00:54.726 --> 00:56.568
I haven't been near him!
You need to get a grip!

00:56.579 --> 00:58.427
You're obsessed, it's pathetic!

00:58.793 --> 01:00.922
Who's pathetic now?!

01:00.955 --> 01:02.154
Ma'am.

01:03.763 --> 01:04.956
Hello, Daddy.

01:05.016 --> 01:06.498
It's me, Olivia.

01:06.726 --> 01:07.991
Why are you so big?

01:08.391 --> 01:11.387
And you, you look different, older.

01:11.712 --> 01:13.232
What's happening to me?

01:14.706 --> 01:15.982
More victims?

Are you in pain?

03:48.446 --> 03:49.662
Here.

04:26.314 --> 04:28.154
We've seen fragments before,

04:28.154 --> 04:30.622
bits of pages that
didn't burn in the car.

04:30.650 --> 04:32.891
Enough to confirm that
he kept journals, but

04:33.252 --> 04:34.795
nothing like this.

04:35.474 --> 04:38.412
Nothing so extensive,
nothing so detailed.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.763
I'd put it to Spector that between

04:42.786 --> 04:45.305
the strangulation of Rose and the

04:45.372 --> 04:46.875
murder of Fiona Gallagher,

04:46.903 --> 04:49.074
that there must have been other attacks.

04:49.838 --> 04:51.609
He said that there
were no other attacks,

04:51.659 --> 04:53.914
that Fiona Gallagher
was his first murder.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.030
During that gap in time, he

04:57.402 --> 05:01.148
suggested that he always
had a "project" to work on.

05:02.524 --> 05:04.314
Are these those "projects"?

05:05.354 --> 05:06.614
A.S.

05:09.461 --> 05:11.874
Might live in the Holylands area,

05:12.302 --> 05:14.172
who might be a journalist...

05:14.882 --> 05:17.413
... who seems to wake up late every day

05:17.533 --> 05:19.095
and skip breakfast.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.979
Who wears a cream robe after her bath

05:23.545 --> 05:27.080
and sometimes doesn't completely
close her bedroom curtains.

05:29.143 --> 05:32.057
Or, R.W...

05:32.514 --> 05:34.992
who cycles to the
university most days off,

05:35.004 --> 05:36.851
somewhere in the Lisburn Road.

05:37.573 --> 05:41.029
Always brings her lunch with her
and eats in the botanic gardens.

05:42.012 --> 05:44.076
Who has clear, pale skin,

05:44.381 --> 05:45.824
wears close-fitting clothes

05:45.857 --> 05:49.392
and walks with a short
stride that Spector likes.

05:51.684 --> 05:56.550
Where on the continuum of his
violence do these journals fit?

05:58.198 --> 06:00.850
Are they just fantasies
that sustain him,

06:00.923 --> 06:02.526
feed his appetites?

06:03.237 --> 06:04.885
Or are they a record...

06:07.050 --> 06:08.842
... of nine more murders?

06:10.474 --> 06:12.010
What time of day is it?

06:12.274 --> 06:14.096
Morning, afternoon, night?

06:15.778 --> 06:17.059
Morning.

06:17.394 --> 06:18.591
Where are we?

06:21.194 --> 06:22.953
Belfast General Hospital.

06:24.394 --> 06:26.421
Can you remember the name of your nurse?

06:31.050 --> 06:32.226
Kiera.

06:34.354 --> 06:36.560
Are you married, or
do you have a partner?

06:36.680 --> 06:37.794
I'm married.

06:39.354 --> 06:41.721
Can you remember any
other family members?

06:44.746 --> 06:47.925
Sally Ann has a father, John,

06:48.935 --> 06:51.074
and a mother, Carol.

06:51.307 --> 06:53.354
We call her Cici.

06:53.354 --> 06:54.808
And what about you?

06:58.104 --> 06:59.181
Me?

06:59.394 --> 07:00.884
Do you have any family?

07:02.394 --> 07:03.625
No.

07:03.936 --> 07:05.114
Why is that?

07:07.098 --> 07:08.447
My mother died.

07:09.374 --> 07:11.011
And what about your father?

07:13.596 --> 07:15.472
When I was growing up, he was known as

07:15.505 --> 07:16.804
Peter Baldwin.

07:17.874 --> 07:21.870
I thought that man was my father,

07:22.441 --> 07:24.039
till he left us.

07:25.277 --> 07:27.013
My mother told me that

07:27.429 --> 07:29.410
he wasn't my real father, he was...

07:30.581 --> 07:32.013
just a man.

07:34.466 --> 07:36.547
When did you become Paul Spector?

07:38.954 --> 07:40.270
Erm...

07:40.764 --> 07:42.956
just before I met Sally Ann.

07:44.471 --> 07:46.052
And why did you change?

07:49.055 --> 07:50.370
Wanted a...

07:50.674 --> 07:52.073
clean start.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.770
- New life.
- Why's that?

07:56.663 --> 07:57.795
Not sure.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.246
Has that new life worked for you?

08:12.501 --> 08:16.196
The sheer volume of garments
suggests there were very many

08:16.224 --> 08:18.360
fetish burglaries at that time.

08:18.914 --> 08:20.563
His journals talk of...

08:21.551 --> 08:23.314
... climbing scaffolding,

08:23.434 --> 08:26.145
finding windows open, doors unlocked,

08:26.201 --> 08:27.749
alarms not set.

08:29.314 --> 08:32.033
I took this photograph to be of a woman.

08:33.073 --> 08:34.863
On closer inspection...

08:35.712 --> 08:37.488
it's clear it's a mannequin.

08:39.114 --> 08:40.745
And these pictures of him.

08:43.794 --> 08:45.079
The bondage,

08:45.967 --> 08:47.810
the auto asphyxiation...

08:49.569 --> 08:51.217
... introduce a new

08:51.738 --> 08:55.046
element to our understanding
of his sexual behaviour.

08:56.354 --> 08:59.087
Has any information returned to you

08:59.098 --> 09:01.617
over the last 12 hours voluntarily?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.847
I don't think so.

09:07.234 --> 09:08.587
Hold this in your hand.

09:10.194 --> 09:11.523
Keep it safe.

09:11.914 --> 09:14.319
Can you give it back to
me in 15 minutes' time?

09:14.863 --> 09:16.006
Yes.

09:17.171 --> 09:19.152
Who's the British Prime Minister?

09:21.089 --> 09:22.359
Tony Blair.

09:24.757 --> 09:26.449
Have you heard of Facebook?

09:28.164 --> 09:29.989
- Yes.
- What is it?

09:31.394 --> 09:32.686
It's...

09:33.285 --> 09:35.377
a social networking site.

09:36.226 --> 09:37.896
And what about Twitter?

09:41.714 --> 09:43.179
I don't know what that is.

09:43.299 --> 09:46.114
So you don't know what
a tweet is, or tweeting?

09:49.514 --> 09:51.321
The sound a bird makes.

09:54.034 --> 09:55.583
What's a hashtag?

09:58.957 --> 10:00.128
No idea.

10:02.108 --> 10:03.479
Presumably,

10:03.673 --> 10:05.771
I'm supposed to know
what these things are?

10:07.358 --> 10:08.474
Maybe.

10:11.597 --> 10:13.195
The main thing

10:13.251 --> 10:15.731
is that we identify
and find these women.

10:17.354 --> 10:18.972
Use the initials,

10:19.522 --> 10:21.070
look at solved or unsolved

10:21.092 --> 10:23.955
sexually motivated murders,
or attempted murders,

10:24.138 --> 10:27.629
particularly strangulations
occurring in homes and apartments,

10:28.600 --> 10:30.758
check Missing Persons for

10:31.196 --> 10:32.878
suspected foul play.

10:34.954 --> 10:37.554
We need to know if these
women are alive or dead.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.635
I think that's all, unless
there's anything else?

10:43.857 --> 10:45.283
We've confirmed the list of

10:45.294 --> 10:47.519
children's homes Spector was in,

10:47.541 --> 10:49.356
following the death of his mother.

10:49.612 --> 10:52.081
We have lists of all his fellow pupils,

10:52.086 --> 10:54.023
including those at Gortnacull.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.474
Any news on the Benedetto girl?

10:56.594 --> 10:59.674
Uniforms called at her
house this morning, Ma'am.

10:59.674 --> 11:01.175
She didn't come home last night,

11:01.192 --> 11:03.314
her mother has no idea where she is.

11:03.567 --> 11:05.742
A warrant's been issued for her arrest.

11:08.154 --> 11:09.504
Thank you all.

11:11.554 --> 11:13.849
What's the last full day you remember?

11:17.479 --> 11:19.016
It was with Olivia.

11:19.904 --> 11:20.994
Go on.

11:23.674 --> 11:24.881
Erm...

11:25.714 --> 11:27.145
I took her to a playgroup,

11:27.716 --> 11:29.564
a musical playgroup.

11:31.063 --> 11:32.793
She loves dancing.

11:34.074 --> 11:35.351
And, erm...

11:35.834 --> 11:37.311
they all sing songs,

11:38.049 --> 11:39.602
The Wheels On The Bus.

11:41.024 --> 11:43.770
She touches all the right places when

11:43.793 --> 11:46.267
she does Head,
Shoulders, Knees And Toes.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.410
Then we went for lunch in the park.

11:54.914 --> 11:58.154
She was pedalling on her tricycle.

12:00.434 --> 12:03.920
There's a pair of swans
on the water there,

12:04.342 --> 12:05.954
nine or ten babies.

12:06.339 --> 12:07.837
Ugly ducklings.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.517
She was talking loads.

12:12.238 --> 12:13.659
She's always getting me to

12:14.175 --> 12:15.867
play make believe with her.

12:16.634 --> 12:19.364
It sounds to me like Olivia
is about two years old.

12:19.597 --> 12:20.879
Yes.

12:21.606 --> 12:23.082
But she isn't, is she?

13:59.415 --> 14:02.239
Can you describe what the
memory loss feels like to you?

14:08.874 --> 14:09.954
Well...

14:12.114 --> 14:14.829
it feels like it's night-time and...

14:16.594 --> 14:18.248
there's a thunderstorm and

14:18.864 --> 14:20.812
I'm standing on a hillside...

14:22.154 --> 14:23.487
and I've been asked to

14:23.964 --> 14:26.605
draw a map of the valley below.

14:28.874 --> 14:30.434
There's lightning flashes.

14:31.411 --> 14:32.950
They light up the land,

14:33.070 --> 14:34.946
but only for a few seconds,

14:35.194 --> 14:37.034
not long enough to draw the map.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.394
Can you recall who you are?

14:48.514 --> 14:49.823
In the sense of what

14:49.835 --> 14:51.705
you were like and what you're like now?

14:52.121 --> 14:54.297
Your trait characteristics?

14:56.554 --> 14:58.148
Erm...

15:00.218 --> 15:01.866
I'm told I have a son.

15:04.914 --> 15:06.256
I've no reason to

15:06.650 --> 15:08.642
think that people are
lying to me, but...

15:09.634 --> 15:11.250
... I don't feel it.

15:13.794 --> 15:16.262
I'm told I'm in trouble with the police.

15:17.794 --> 15:19.434
I don't know what I've done.

15:23.274 --> 15:26.118
I think that I might be different

15:26.429 --> 15:29.092
but I don't know why.

15:31.285 --> 15:32.517
I feel like

15:33.144 --> 15:34.814
I'm an all-right person?

16:01.728 --> 16:03.415
It will all come back to me, won't it?

16:05.408 --> 16:08.094
Your anterograde memory is working well.

16:10.668 --> 16:12.539
Anything else you've forgotten,

16:12.739 --> 16:13.987
you can relearn.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.281
But the ownership has gone.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.626
Gibson?

17:02.665 --> 17:06.298
Patrick Spencer, ICU Consultant,
Belfast General Hospital.

17:06.874 --> 17:08.800
Thank you for calling me back, Doctor.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.276
- I understand he's conscious?
- He is.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.482
His physiology is normalising.

17:13.877 --> 17:16.041
He's cardiovascularly stable...

17:16.162 --> 17:17.693
and has made good progress given the

17:17.734 --> 17:20.772
massive insult and blood
loss from the bullet wounds...

17:21.258 --> 17:22.674
But?

17:22.971 --> 17:25.406
But there is an issue.

17:25.718 --> 17:27.383
Although his short-term memory

17:27.417 --> 17:29.610
seems to be functioning adequately...

17:30.354 --> 17:32.308
... it seems Mr Spector has suffered

17:32.343 --> 17:34.874
quite extensive long-term memory loss.

17:44.698 --> 17:46.286
OK.

17:48.395 --> 17:50.254
I'm just going to move your legs

17:50.268 --> 17:53.458
to the edge of the bed, here. OK...

17:53.506 --> 17:55.310
I'm now going to take your arm now.

17:57.981 --> 17:59.514
OK, here we go...

18:05.645 --> 18:06.797
Keep going.

18:07.282 --> 18:09.127
Over here...

18:10.514 --> 18:11.804
Here.

18:16.646 --> 18:19.483
OK, that's good. Well done.

18:21.307 --> 18:23.783
Apparently, he's docile,

18:23.903 --> 18:27.256
well oriented in time
and space and has...

18:27.443 --> 18:30.624
established good relations
with his doctors and nurses.

18:30.624 --> 18:32.250
(For pity's sake!)

18:32.854 --> 18:35.531
It seems he can acquire new information

18:35.545 --> 18:38.446
and keep track of his medical
procedures, but that he has

18:38.701 --> 18:41.121
almost no recollection of the events

18:41.137 --> 18:43.807
that have taken place over
the last six years or so.

18:43.868 --> 18:46.000
Are we supposed to be
taking this seriously?

18:47.570 --> 18:48.944
I think we have to.

18:49.884 --> 18:51.504
Are they linking this...

18:52.165 --> 18:54.689
... this impairment
directly to the shooting?

18:55.464 --> 18:58.744
The nature of the amnesia
has not been established yet.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.729
It... It might be organic, an

19:02.757 --> 19:04.849
injury to the brain
because of blood loss

19:04.865 --> 19:06.985
or a resultant lack of oxygen,

19:07.384 --> 19:09.704
or it could be psychogenic,

19:10.053 --> 19:12.201
a result, perhaps, of trauma.

19:13.332 --> 19:16.462
But until they do an MRI
scan, they can't really say.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.819
So, perform the MRI scan.

19:20.429 --> 19:22.777
Spector has retained metal fragments

19:22.782 --> 19:24.314
from the bullet in his body.

19:25.551 --> 19:27.310
If they contain iron,

19:27.316 --> 19:28.908
the fragments can be heated up

19:28.919 --> 19:31.325
and the magnet can drag
them through the body and

19:31.328 --> 19:33.320
cause more organ damage.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.761
Are they conducting
psychological tests yet?

19:35.978 --> 19:37.348
Yes, they are.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.446
The Consultant Neuropsychologist

19:39.463 --> 19:41.588
- is an Alison Walden.
- But Jim's right.

19:41.777 --> 19:44.850
He must be feigning,
surely? Or at the very least,

19:44.889 --> 19:47.591
- exaggerating his symptoms?
- To what end?

19:48.701 --> 19:50.205
The law does not concern itself

19:50.222 --> 19:52.197
with the present state of
mind of the criminal defendant,

19:52.236 --> 19:53.950
only with the state of mind

19:54.070 --> 19:55.682
at the time the crime was committed.

19:55.715 --> 19:58.273
And Spector's was clearly conveyed

19:58.301 --> 20:00.160
in his confession. He clearly understood

20:00.171 --> 20:01.802
the difference between right

20:02.024 --> 20:04.265
and wrong at the time of the crimes,

20:04.298 --> 20:06.435
and, therefore, he will
be held accountable.

20:07.084 --> 20:09.784
But it is founded on
memory-based evidence.

20:11.024 --> 20:13.560
And he's saying that he can't
remember any of the crimes.

20:13.572 --> 20:16.185
It poses all sorts of
problems for the courts.

20:16.696 --> 20:19.664
It's almost like he's
claiming that he's innocent.

20:20.064 --> 20:22.454
It seems there's more
than usual pressure

20:22.471 --> 20:24.784
to build the evidential
case against him.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.202
That's precisely what we're doing, sir.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.047
What will happen to him
if the defence does ask

20:34.058 --> 20:35.545
for a mental health assessment?

20:35.595 --> 20:39.541
His potential dangerousness
suggests a forensic unit

20:39.763 --> 20:41.683
rather than a hospital ward.

20:41.744 --> 20:43.098
And where would that be?

20:43.218 --> 20:45.556
The Foyle Clinic in East Belfast.

20:45.676 --> 20:47.032
Who will assess him?

20:47.525 --> 20:49.179
August Larson.

20:49.395 --> 20:52.220
He's the Consultant
Forensic Psychiatrist.

20:52.254 --> 20:53.785
Very experienced,

20:53.963 --> 20:56.521
very used to giving
expert testimony in court.

20:58.285 --> 21:00.388
The sooner we get him out
of the hands of the medics,

21:00.416 --> 21:02.757
and back into the justice
system, the better.

21:19.106 --> 21:20.443
Thanks, Alison.

21:34.384 --> 21:37.170
Kiera Sheridan. Mr
Spector's dedicated nurse.

21:37.203 --> 21:38.885
She provides him with one-to-one care.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.278
She will limit your visit

21:40.333 --> 21:42.653
- if patient status warrants it.
- Thank you.

21:42.773 --> 21:44.068
She'll show you in.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.386
What about the wife?

21:54.679 --> 21:56.344
I'm worried about her.

21:57.436 --> 21:58.990
It's obviously been a

21:59.110 --> 22:00.521
devastating blow to her

22:00.527 --> 22:02.799
as it would be to anyone
who seems to have had

22:02.919 --> 22:04.739
no real suspicions.

22:05.255 --> 22:07.369
But there's no possibility of her

22:07.625 --> 22:09.234
repeating the offence.

22:10.043 --> 22:11.680
She's admitted her guilt,

22:11.691 --> 22:13.464
she's corrected the facts.

22:13.584 --> 22:14.816
She might even end up being

22:14.833 --> 22:16.342
a witness for the prosecution.

22:18.101 --> 22:19.977
I think we should drop the charges.

22:20.097 --> 22:21.386
If she'd told the truth,

22:21.414 --> 22:23.911
in the first place, about
Spector's whereabouts,

22:24.255 --> 22:26.519
then we could have
investigated him more closely

22:27.035 --> 22:29.122
and, perhaps, Rose Stagg
would not have been put

22:29.122 --> 22:30.842
through the ordeal that she has.

22:33.062 --> 22:34.588
I just feel

22:35.004 --> 22:36.996
that pursuing her through the courts

22:37.013 --> 22:38.704
will likely have a very bad effect

22:38.727 --> 22:40.658
on her mental and physical health.

22:42.312 --> 22:43.988
Is prosecution

22:44.315 --> 22:46.446
really in the public interest?

22:46.646 --> 22:48.904
As Director of Public Prosecutions,

22:48.916 --> 22:50.625
I have to say, I think it is.

22:50.908 --> 22:53.184
How things will unfold
with Spector is unclear.

22:53.184 --> 22:56.041
Prosecuting his wife
sends a clear signal:

22:56.946 --> 22:58.256
we mean business

22:58.376 --> 23:00.959
and no-one involved will
be getting off lightly.

23:04.127 --> 23:06.292
Sally Ann Spector miscarried

23:06.303 --> 23:07.712
in police custody.

23:09.482 --> 23:12.229
That's a devastating thing
to happen to any woman,

23:12.978 --> 23:14.177
but particularly her.

23:14.188 --> 23:16.368
Her identity is wrapped up

23:16.385 --> 23:18.594
in her children and
those that she cares for.

23:18.854 --> 23:21.351
She's perceived as an angel

23:21.373 --> 23:22.849
by the parents of the babies

23:22.849 --> 23:24.819
she looks after in the NICU.

23:25.291 --> 23:26.928
Now, it appears as if

23:27.111 --> 23:29.374
she's lost everything, her marriage, her

23:30.023 --> 23:32.304
work, her unborn child.

23:34.484 --> 23:37.247
She's paid a very high
price for her naivety.

23:37.303 --> 23:39.144
I can't believe that, of all people,

23:39.162 --> 23:42.758
you are suggesting that we treat
Sally Ann paternalistically.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.815
I say we move ahead with the charges

23:47.115 --> 23:49.618
and we can use them as
leverage against Spector.

23:49.679 --> 23:51.516
I do think we need to bear in mind

23:51.521 --> 23:53.907
the seriousness of the offence.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.296
We accepted instructions

23:59.346 --> 24:00.782
on your behalf from your wife

24:00.784 --> 24:02.231
when you were unconscious.

24:02.297 --> 24:05.449
Today is an opportunity
for you to say if you are

24:05.569 --> 24:07.721
happy for us to be representing you.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.512
I believe that the nature

24:10.584 --> 24:12.881
of your injuries has
been explained to you?

24:13.670 --> 24:14.852
Yes.

24:15.384 --> 24:17.532
And you understand that
you were in police custody

24:17.538 --> 24:18.770
when you were shot?

24:19.352 --> 24:21.624
Yes, but I still don't know why.

24:21.644 --> 24:23.144
No-one will tell me.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.332
An individual called James Tyler

24:27.338 --> 24:28.564
was responsible.

24:36.294 --> 24:37.720
I don't know who that is.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.417
Why did he shoot me?

24:40.800 --> 24:42.476
I need to get more
information from the police

24:42.481 --> 24:43.880
before I can explain that.

24:44.785 --> 24:47.104
The more pressing issue, Mr Spector,

24:47.909 --> 24:49.557
is that the police have charged you

24:49.568 --> 24:51.965
with a number of very
serious crimes. I mean,

24:52.620 --> 24:54.944
the most serious crimes
on the Statute Book.

24:56.299 --> 24:57.592
What crimes?

24:57.712 --> 24:59.024
A series of murders.

25:04.978 --> 25:06.426
What sort of murders?

25:07.237 --> 25:08.846
With your permission,

25:08.966 --> 25:11.260
let me take you through
the police charge sheet.

25:13.391 --> 25:15.767
All the, er... alleged crimes

25:15.822 --> 25:17.354
took place in Belfast.

25:19.135 --> 25:22.631
The police claim that on the
10th day of December, 2011,

25:22.664 --> 25:25.144
you murdered University
lecturer Fiona Gallagher

25:25.172 --> 25:27.697
in her home before fleeing the scene.

25:28.330 --> 25:30.188
Death by strangulation.

25:31.548 --> 25:35.854
That on the 15th of March, 2012,

25:36.381 --> 25:39.833
you murdered architect
Alice Monroe in her home,

25:40.024 --> 25:41.665
strangling her with a ligature.

25:43.058 --> 25:46.127
They allege that you then
washed and dried her body,

25:46.471 --> 25:48.346
before putting her back to bed

25:48.568 --> 25:50.144
and posing her body.

25:50.704 --> 25:54.616
That on the 16th of April, 2012,

25:54.860 --> 25:58.096
you murdered solicitor
Sarah Kay in her home,

25:58.135 --> 25:59.904
strangling her with a ligature.

26:01.675 --> 26:04.622
They allege that you washed

26:04.672 --> 26:06.744
and dried Sarah's body,

26:07.080 --> 26:09.138
washed and dried her bedclothes...

26:10.264 --> 26:12.966
... painted her finger nails red,

26:13.005 --> 26:15.102
before posing her in her bed

26:15.222 --> 26:16.723
and taking photographs.

26:17.904 --> 26:20.879
Sarah Kay was pregnant
at the time of her death.

26:23.904 --> 26:25.530
That four days later,

26:25.596 --> 26:28.210
on the 20th of April, 2012...

26:30.290 --> 26:32.122
... you attacked and strangled

26:32.194 --> 26:35.024
accountant Annie Brawley in her home.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.864
They claim that you...

26:39.984 --> 26:42.659
also murdered her brother Joseph Brawley

26:42.984 --> 26:44.862
when he tried to defend his sister,

26:45.144 --> 26:46.765
stabbing him three times

26:46.792 --> 26:49.217
with some decorating shears.

26:49.478 --> 26:51.187
You, then, fled the scene.

26:51.725 --> 26:54.272
Annie Brawley survived the attack.

26:58.867 --> 27:00.881
I don't recognise any of these people.

27:01.514 --> 27:03.501
I've never seen these people before.

27:04.334 --> 27:05.784
There's more.

27:07.507 --> 27:10.144
They allege that on May the 3rd,

27:10.449 --> 27:13.601
you abducted Rose Stagg from her home,

27:14.694 --> 27:16.852
imprisoned her unlawfully

27:16.972 --> 27:19.033
and detained her against her will.

27:25.475 --> 27:26.744
I know her.

27:29.504 --> 27:32.619
- Rose what, who did you say?
- Stagg.

27:33.418 --> 27:36.398
Perhaps you know Mrs Stagg
better as Rose McGill?

27:39.278 --> 27:40.543
Yes.

27:42.984 --> 27:44.915
But I haven't seen her

27:45.359 --> 27:46.980
in the last four years or so.

27:48.051 --> 27:50.232
When did you last see her, do you think?

27:52.989 --> 27:54.499
Early summer.

27:55.237 --> 27:56.624
2002.

27:58.206 --> 28:00.984
2002 is ten years ago, not four.

28:01.452 --> 28:04.116
Have you been listening
to the charges, Mr Spector?

28:04.464 --> 28:05.904
It's May 2012.

28:09.904 --> 28:10.904
I'm sorry.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.427
I'm sorry.

28:17.206 --> 28:18.744
What happened to Rose?

28:20.104 --> 28:21.344
She's alive.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.070
The police say you led them to her.

28:25.902 --> 28:27.933
She was found in the
boot of her own car.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.813
The police suggest you left her trapped.

28:31.146 --> 28:32.683
Left her to die.

28:38.344 --> 28:40.104
Why would I do that to Rose?

29:05.144 --> 29:07.294
The police say they have a confession.

29:07.824 --> 29:09.924
That you made a number of admissions.

29:12.072 --> 29:13.384
I've, um...

29:13.384 --> 29:14.818
no memory of that.

29:15.264 --> 29:17.515
We think it makes sense for
your first appearance in court

29:17.531 --> 29:18.586
to be as soon as possible

29:18.625 --> 29:21.438
because it will initiate the
evidential disclosure process.

29:21.744 --> 29:23.285
Will you be strong enough?

29:25.250 --> 29:26.881
Once we are in receipt
of those documents,

29:26.892 --> 29:28.824
we will look at the
detail of that confession

29:28.944 --> 29:31.569
and take you through every
bit of evidence against you,

29:31.689 --> 29:32.912
every witness statement,

29:32.934 --> 29:34.904
page by page, line by line.

29:36.158 --> 29:37.418
Is that all clear?

29:40.664 --> 29:41.940
Yes.

29:42.667 --> 29:43.904
Any questions?

29:50.281 --> 29:52.504
I just need some time
for it all to sink in.

29:52.861 --> 29:54.065
Of course.

29:57.104 --> 29:58.904
Do you know who that is?

30:04.014 --> 30:05.104
No.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.538
Should I?

30:07.777 --> 30:10.612
If any memories relevant
to the case return to you,

30:10.684 --> 30:12.715
please contact Louise here.

30:14.985 --> 30:17.083
We're here to help you, Mr Spector.

30:18.509 --> 30:20.490
We will guide you through this.

30:21.184 --> 30:22.438
Thank you.

31:12.584 --> 31:15.055
Sorry, ma'am. Rose
Stagg is here to see you.

31:17.702 --> 31:19.561
Set up an interview room, Dani.

31:20.038 --> 31:21.481
I'd like you to sit in.

31:22.258 --> 31:23.544
Of course.

31:29.904 --> 31:32.214
I woke to find him in bed with me.

31:37.264 --> 31:38.911
He took me downstairs,

31:39.216 --> 31:40.920
his hand over my mouth,

31:41.530 --> 31:43.101
took me into the kitchen.

31:45.864 --> 31:47.102
Go on.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.809
He used my name.

31:51.903 --> 31:53.504
He called me Rose.

31:59.464 --> 32:02.041
I thought, perhaps, I
recognised the voice.

32:05.476 --> 32:08.664
He said he didn't want to
hurt me or my lovely family...

32:10.028 --> 32:11.992
... but that he would if I cried out.

32:15.749 --> 32:17.530
And then he released me.

32:21.043 --> 32:23.984
And when I turned
round, I recognised him.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.824
What did you think in that moment?

32:35.405 --> 32:36.824
Just for a moment...

32:38.130 --> 32:40.511
... I thought that maybe
it would be all right.

32:41.754 --> 32:43.713
That maybe it was a joke,

32:44.462 --> 32:45.788
a game.

33:00.089 --> 33:01.498
What did you say?

33:03.580 --> 33:06.393
I just said, "Peter?"

33:14.023 --> 33:15.189
He...

33:15.384 --> 33:17.020
made me dress from clothes

33:17.026 --> 33:18.940
that were hanging in the utility room.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.303
He made me write a note.

33:22.364 --> 33:24.079
He told me what to put.

33:27.087 --> 33:29.144
The house seemed so silent.

33:31.544 --> 33:33.918
The sound of the pen on the paper

33:33.929 --> 33:36.143
seemed really loud in my head.

33:37.164 --> 33:38.624
Like a whooshing.

33:41.242 --> 33:44.078
All I could think about was
getting him out of there,

33:44.198 --> 33:45.944
away from Nancy.

33:48.105 --> 33:49.744
Did you resist him at all?

33:52.744 --> 33:54.584
Er... I was numb.

33:57.213 --> 33:58.944
I didn't really struggle

33:58.983 --> 34:02.024
until he was walking me
towards that awful building.

34:05.952 --> 34:08.304
I thought, "If he takes me in there...

34:10.203 --> 34:12.045
... I'm gonna die.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.944
I'm going to be the next victim."

34:19.409 --> 34:21.324
That's when I tried to run.

34:24.464 --> 34:26.196
But he was too strong.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.474
He made tapes of you.

34:38.178 --> 34:41.295
We found edited versions
of those tapes on his phone.

34:44.038 --> 34:45.725
You've seen them?

34:53.242 --> 34:55.511
He tied me to a chair.

34:55.949 --> 34:58.224
It was fixed to the ground.

35:00.095 --> 35:01.599
And he sat behind the camera,

35:01.605 --> 35:03.192
so that when I looked at him,

35:03.663 --> 35:06.064
I was looking directly into the lens.

35:08.504 --> 35:10.361
He hardly spoke, he...

35:11.824 --> 35:13.374
He just stared at me.

35:19.295 --> 35:22.264
I tried everything I could
to get through to him.

35:23.513 --> 35:26.703
I begged him, I flattered him,

35:26.823 --> 35:29.594
I insulted him. I tried
to provoke him, even.

35:32.069 --> 35:33.904
He didn't respond.

35:35.948 --> 35:37.158
His eyes were open,

35:37.164 --> 35:39.100
but it was like he was in a trance.

35:40.815 --> 35:42.740
Did he sexually assault you?

35:45.304 --> 35:46.304
No.

35:47.285 --> 35:48.684
I don't think so.

35:51.014 --> 35:53.389
Did he perform sex acts on himself?

35:54.011 --> 35:55.664
Did he masturbate in front of you?

35:56.542 --> 35:58.523
No. Just the filming.

36:04.889 --> 36:06.582
Are those healing all right?

36:09.957 --> 36:11.864
I'm told I did it to myself.

36:14.224 --> 36:16.043
I have no memory of that.

36:16.864 --> 36:20.155
We found the broken lens
from a pair of sunglasses

36:20.184 --> 36:21.775
in the boot of your car.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.446
Your blood was on them.

36:23.468 --> 36:24.967
There were no other fingerprints.

36:29.584 --> 36:32.104
I can't work out if it's just marks...

36:33.857 --> 36:35.566
... or if it's a message.

36:37.614 --> 36:39.304
When I first saw it...

36:40.477 --> 36:42.575
... it looked like an attempt to write

36:43.308 --> 36:44.567
"I love you".

36:54.789 --> 36:56.224
Breathe.

37:06.584 --> 37:09.069
I always thought that I wanted...

37:10.567 --> 37:12.736
... love and security.

37:14.544 --> 37:16.172
Now I just

37:16.805 --> 37:19.064
feel like I'm floating free...

37:20.950 --> 37:22.464
... in a void.

37:26.859 --> 37:28.491
Oh...

37:31.948 --> 37:34.789
You have such a strong sense of purpose.

37:36.824 --> 37:38.180
I feel like...

37:38.744 --> 37:41.624
there's nothing beneath
my feet right now, like...

37:43.134 --> 37:45.104
... nothing to steady them.

37:49.655 --> 37:52.168
It's as if I'm slightly drunk... !

37:53.104 --> 37:55.292
Rose. Rose...

37:57.833 --> 37:59.148
Remember...

38:00.330 --> 38:01.704
... you survived.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.144
You got through it.

38:09.824 --> 38:11.384
It's in the past.

38:27.407 --> 38:30.736
Paul Spector, a 32-year-old
bereavement counsellor

38:30.759 --> 38:34.184
from South Belfast charged
with four counts of murder

38:34.216 --> 38:37.301
is due to make his first
appearance in court today.

38:37.504 --> 38:38.971
The four female victims,

38:38.993 --> 38:41.463
all young professional
women in their 30s,

38:41.583 --> 38:43.899
were attacked in their homes at night.

38:44.019 --> 38:48.016
Three of those women died of
manual or ligature strangulation.

38:48.815 --> 38:51.344
Spector, a married man
and a father of two,

38:51.356 --> 38:55.384
is also charged with the attempted
murder of accountant Annie Brawley

38:55.504 --> 38:57.954
and the abduction and
unlawful imprisonment

38:58.074 --> 39:00.704
of Belfast radiologist Rose Stagg...

39:31.658 --> 39:33.944
I worry this is all too soon for you.

39:35.515 --> 39:36.881
I'll be fine.

39:59.702 --> 40:01.069
Are you getting this?

40:01.702 --> 40:03.067
The victims' families...

40:03.104 --> 40:04.664
Detective Superintendent Gibson!

40:04.664 --> 40:06.119
The man you have in custody,

40:06.163 --> 40:07.773
- will he be appearing in court today?
- Will you be making a statement

40:07.784 --> 40:08.950
any time soon?

40:09.527 --> 40:12.651
Chief Superintendent, is Spector
appearing in person today?

40:12.704 --> 40:14.172
Give us an update on the condition

40:14.177 --> 40:15.598
of Rose Stagg...

40:36.748 --> 40:38.224
Are you ready for this?

40:38.224 --> 40:39.824
I'm a bit nervous, but, yeah.

40:40.449 --> 40:42.264
Yeah, shall we head up, then?

40:42.680 --> 40:44.977
- How are you?
- Not too bad...

41:20.005 --> 41:21.226
Stand there.

41:31.858 --> 41:33.567
Look straight into that camera.

41:33.617 --> 41:36.696
You will be able to see the
judge and the legal teams.

41:36.890 --> 41:38.417
Answer any questions clearly.

41:57.590 --> 41:59.637
The prosecution has suggested

41:59.643 --> 42:01.446
we read the shortened
version of the charge.

42:01.468 --> 42:03.710
- Are you happy enough with that?
- Yeah, that's fine.

42:08.944 --> 42:10.384
All rise.

42:16.824 --> 42:18.804
Thank you. Please sit.

42:24.082 --> 42:25.824
Are you ready to proceed, ma'am?

42:27.784 --> 42:29.015
I am.

42:32.860 --> 42:36.274
Mr Spector, can you see
and hear the proceedings?

42:36.512 --> 42:37.894
Yes.

42:38.488 --> 42:40.397
The charges against the accused

42:40.425 --> 42:42.544
are stated as four counts of murder,

42:42.966 --> 42:44.708
one of attempted murder

42:45.030 --> 42:48.204
and one of abduction and
unlawful imprisonment.

42:48.637 --> 42:49.952
Can you confirm for the court

42:49.952 --> 42:51.716
that you are Peter Paul Spector?

42:52.676 --> 42:53.940
Yes.

42:53.968 --> 42:57.624
That your date of birth
is the 25th May, 1979.

42:57.744 --> 42:59.144
That's correct.

42:59.522 --> 43:03.146
And that you live at 64,
Tiberias Drive, Belfast,

43:03.168 --> 43:05.624
BT6 7KM?

43:06.437 --> 43:07.784
So I've been told.

43:12.275 --> 43:14.264
Why is he answering in that manner?

43:14.578 --> 43:16.403
Ma'am, if I may.

43:17.075 --> 43:19.428
My client has to answer in that manner

43:19.445 --> 43:21.784
because he has suffered
significant memory loss.

43:22.042 --> 43:23.357
As you no doubt know,

43:23.385 --> 43:26.509
Mr Spector was shot
while in police custody.

43:26.770 --> 43:30.638
He lost his spleen as a result
and was in a coma for some time.

43:30.758 --> 43:32.908
The reason he is appearing from hospital

43:32.941 --> 43:35.610
is that he is still being
held there in intensive care.

43:36.024 --> 43:37.503
I have written reports

43:37.509 --> 43:40.094
from the ICU Consultant, Dr Spencer,

43:40.104 --> 43:44.157
and from the Consultant
Neuropsychologist Dr Alison Walden,

43:44.277 --> 43:46.232
that explain the nature and degree

43:46.237 --> 43:48.685
of my client's disability.

43:49.224 --> 43:51.648
Dr Walden is approved under Part

43:51.654 --> 43:54.264
of the Mental Health Order 1986.

43:54.384 --> 43:55.822
There's information there about

43:55.839 --> 43:58.080
the treatment Mr Spector has undergone

43:58.091 --> 44:01.424
and an account of his
behaviour in hospital.

44:01.471 --> 44:03.064
The memory loss, you will see,

44:03.064 --> 44:05.239
covers a period of
approximately six years

44:05.272 --> 44:06.637
up to and including

44:06.757 --> 44:08.719
the recent shooting.

44:09.340 --> 44:12.692
One of the primary
foundations of criminal law

44:12.725 --> 44:14.567
is that all defendants

44:14.590 --> 44:18.390
are capable of actively
participating in their defence.

44:18.818 --> 44:22.569
Mr Spector's amnesia
prevents him from so doing.

44:23.529 --> 44:26.514
Whilst Mr Spector understands
that he is in court

44:26.544 --> 44:28.994
and charged with a number
of criminal offences

44:29.033 --> 44:31.147
and understands the nature and object

44:31.267 --> 44:33.345
and the possible consequences
of the proceedings,

44:33.664 --> 44:35.224
he cannot enter a plea,

44:35.436 --> 44:38.045
he cannot consult with
or assist his lawyer,

44:38.244 --> 44:40.584
he cannot give evidence
in his own defence.

44:40.584 --> 44:43.894
On that basis, I feel I need
to raise the issue of competence

44:44.014 --> 44:47.239
as to whether Mr Spector
is fit to stand trial.

44:47.256 --> 44:49.131
Mr Healy, let me stop you there.

44:49.176 --> 44:52.028
The concerns you have raised are noted,

44:52.327 --> 44:53.787
but you know as well as I do

44:53.797 --> 44:56.527
that it's not a matter on
which this court can adjudicate.

45:00.824 --> 45:02.056
Mr Spector,

45:02.328 --> 45:04.669
do you understand that your case

45:04.686 --> 45:06.734
must be sent to Crown Court?

45:07.538 --> 45:08.715
Yes.

45:09.880 --> 45:12.383
Then you will be held
on remand in hospital

45:12.444 --> 45:14.197
until arrangements can be made

45:14.214 --> 45:17.704
to transfer you to a
secure psychiatric clinic

45:17.948 --> 45:20.184
where more tests can be done

45:20.212 --> 45:23.520
to determine the nature
of your mental disability.

45:43.275 --> 45:45.156
That's the guy who's
defending the murderer!

45:45.173 --> 45:47.992
Mr Healy, how does it feel to be
defending the Belfast Strangler?

45:48.003 --> 45:50.734
The ALLEGED Belfast Strangler.

45:55.226 --> 45:58.024
Dressed in a blue sweatshirt
and tracksuit bottoms,

45:58.024 --> 46:00.012
Mr Spector spoke only
to confirm his name

46:00.023 --> 46:02.259
and date of birth during
the ten-minute hearing,

46:02.379 --> 46:04.664
at that point proceedings
took a bizarre twist

46:04.664 --> 46:07.182
as it became apparent that
the alleged serial killer

46:07.226 --> 46:09.657
is suffering from
significant memory loss.

46:10.046 --> 46:13.009
Mr Spector was remanded in
custody to undergo further medical

46:13.053 --> 46:14.624
and psychiatric assessment.

46:14.624 --> 46:17.448
Following the hearing, the
public prosecution service

46:17.448 --> 46:19.384
confirmed that Sally Ann Spector

46:19.384 --> 46:22.636
will appear in the Crown
Court on Monday 2nd July

46:22.756 --> 46:25.089
to face charges of perverting
the course of justice.

46:25.139 --> 46:27.637
The prosecution claims
that Mr Spector's wife,

46:27.681 --> 46:30.184
provided her husband with false alibis.

46:50.264 --> 46:51.455
Gibson?

46:51.766 --> 46:53.725
Superintendent Gibson?

46:54.504 --> 46:55.792
Yes.

46:55.997 --> 46:57.901
I'm August Larson.

46:58.755 --> 47:00.587
I'm the consultant psychiatrist

47:00.603 --> 47:02.944
who has been asked to
assess Paul Spector.

47:05.658 --> 47:08.133
It's an odd time to be calling, Doctor.

47:10.503 --> 47:12.184
Are you still working?

47:12.956 --> 47:14.255
Yes.

47:14.438 --> 47:15.944
Well, there you are.

47:17.251 --> 47:19.310
Before he's moved here,

47:19.360 --> 47:21.819
I need to determine the risk of violence

47:21.825 --> 47:23.722
towards himself and others

47:24.049 --> 47:25.742
and plan his management.

47:27.219 --> 47:30.110
Have you seen the list of
crimes he's been charged with?

47:31.430 --> 47:34.399
I received that information
from the court, yes.

47:37.729 --> 47:39.361
In my experience,

47:39.433 --> 47:42.907
a history of previous violence
is the best predictor for

47:42.985 --> 47:45.354
future violence for
someone whether they are

47:45.409 --> 47:47.546
mentally disordered or not.

47:48.372 --> 47:50.038
And Paul Spector

47:50.426 --> 47:53.067
is a violent sexual sadist.

48:00.470 --> 48:02.104
Why are you so kind to me?

48:05.984 --> 48:07.739
If I've done the things that the...

48:08.555 --> 48:11.119
police say I've done,
then I'm a monster.

48:13.033 --> 48:14.504
It's my job.

48:20.647 --> 48:21.784
What?

48:25.041 --> 48:26.884
It says in your notes
that there were tears

48:26.917 --> 48:28.784
in your eyes during your surgery.

48:29.708 --> 48:31.201
That you were crying.

48:35.504 --> 48:36.904
Was I?

48:39.692 --> 48:41.617
Does that mean anything to you?

48:46.357 --> 48:47.504
Perhaps...

48:49.624 --> 48:50.864
I just...

48:51.746 --> 48:54.587
- ... can't believe the memory loss is real.
- _

48:56.202 --> 48:58.505
He's just the sort of
person who would feign

48:59.035 --> 49:01.934
amnesia if he felt that there was
something to be gained from it.

49:02.255 --> 49:05.081
Even just for the sheer
delight of duping people,

49:05.602 --> 49:08.071
particularly experts.

49:08.798 --> 49:11.062
Someone like me, for example?

49:11.824 --> 49:13.293
I'm just saying that,

49:13.327 --> 49:14.842
from my conversations with him,

49:14.875 --> 49:17.582
it seems to me that he
exhibits, if anything, a

49:18.060 --> 49:20.645
superior memory for his violence.

49:21.261 --> 49:23.043
It's clear to me

49:23.277 --> 49:26.989
that he rehearsed the crimes
in his mind over and over.

49:27.754 --> 49:29.980
They were heavily scripted.

49:30.100 --> 49:33.642
And so, the crimes
themselves were memorable

49:33.762 --> 49:36.384
both in the way that
they match the script

49:36.406 --> 49:38.384
and in the way that they differ.

49:39.730 --> 49:41.904
So, in my view, it's...

49:42.843 --> 49:45.504
... extremely unlikely that he has...

49:45.728 --> 49:47.404
forgotten anything.

49:47.584 --> 49:49.302
Faced with memory loss,

49:49.346 --> 49:52.304
there is only one way a clinician can go

49:52.543 --> 49:54.424
and that is to investigate.

49:56.167 --> 49:57.984
If we take him here,

49:57.984 --> 50:00.435
then that is what I intend to do.

50:01.111 --> 50:02.249
If you have the time,

50:02.264 --> 50:05.101
I'd really appreciate
getting a premorbid appraisal

50:05.144 --> 50:06.666
of Mr Spector from you.

50:06.705 --> 50:10.373
As someone who has had
extensive dealings with him.

50:11.260 --> 50:13.386
Anything at all you
can tell me about him

50:13.391 --> 50:15.533
would be extremely useful.

50:18.521 --> 50:20.344
I'll help in any way I can.

50:21.711 --> 50:23.087
Thank you.

50:23.875 --> 50:25.390
Good night.

50:27.071 --> 50:28.459
Good night.

50:41.467 --> 50:43.215
Everything went dark.

50:44.319 --> 50:47.038
And did time seem to
speed up or slow down?

50:49.196 --> 50:50.511
It sped up.

50:52.384 --> 50:54.823
I was rushing through a tunnel.

50:56.555 --> 51:00.306
And did you see or feel
surrounded by a brilliant light?

51:01.443 --> 51:02.658
There was a light.

51:02.686 --> 51:04.018
Can you describe it?

51:06.848 --> 51:08.374
Incredibly bright.

51:08.763 --> 51:10.499
- Blinding.
- And hot?

51:11.442 --> 51:13.144
No, not hot.

51:15.144 --> 51:16.785
Did you come to a border or a

51:16.791 --> 51:18.333
point of no return?

51:22.344 --> 51:23.937
There was a point. Um...

51:24.292 --> 51:26.024
I felt I could have gone on.

51:27.177 --> 51:30.079
But there were voices calling me back.

51:30.501 --> 51:31.864
What voices?

51:32.984 --> 51:34.241
My daughter.

51:34.774 --> 51:36.033
Olivia.

52:03.767 --> 52:06.430
And was there anyone
else there known to you,

52:06.935 --> 52:08.224
living or dead?

52:10.064 --> 52:11.264
Yes.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.051
Who?

52:18.064 --> 52:19.464
I think my mother.

52:21.314 --> 52:22.704
And what happened?

52:24.993 --> 52:27.285
How did you feel in her presence?

52:35.531 --> 52:36.864
Afraid.

52:38.301 --> 52:39.888
Did she speak to you?

52:43.517 --> 52:44.921
She was calling me.

52:45.631 --> 52:47.035
I think she wanted me to

52:47.551 --> 52:48.966
come to her.

52:49.566 --> 52:50.986
Towards the light.

52:52.468 --> 52:54.283
But there was other voices.

52:55.064 --> 52:56.984
My daughter calling me back.

53:00.593 --> 53:02.185
And did you want to come back

53:02.202 --> 53:03.379
to your body?

53:03.664 --> 53:05.260
Come back to life?

53:10.050 --> 53:11.304
No.

53:13.884 --> 53:16.059
But I couldn't just abandon her.

53:18.079 --> 53:19.624
Is that when you cried?

53:25.024 --> 53:26.304
Hey.

53:35.816 --> 53:37.169
Drink it all up.

53:42.464 --> 53:43.718
Good girl.

54:20.489 --> 54:22.424
You came close with dying.

54:25.011 --> 54:27.752
What do you now understand death to be?

54:27.941 --> 54:29.989
What does death mean to you now?

54:33.719 --> 54:35.273
I know that life

54:35.611 --> 54:37.548
is our only true possession.

54:39.824 --> 54:41.064
And death?

54:50.269 --> 54:52.383
I've found a murder
that looks promising.

54:52.588 --> 54:54.753
Really? The right initials?

54:54.764 --> 54:56.423
That's not the connection.

54:56.490 --> 54:59.087
A law student. Susan Harper.

54:59.537 --> 55:01.362
Do you think she looks right?

55:02.284 --> 55:03.798
Yes, absolutely.

55:03.854 --> 55:05.785
- Just a bit younger.
- 21.

55:05.905 --> 55:08.827
The only problem is there
is someone doing time for it.

55:09.248 --> 55:11.606
It's an individual called David Alvarez.

55:11.634 --> 55:14.369
I remembered I saw his name yesterday

55:14.386 --> 55:16.332
on the list of children
who were in Gortnacull

55:16.334 --> 55:17.799
at the same time as Spector.

55:17.919 --> 55:19.384
So, I've done some digging.

55:19.613 --> 55:21.178
And they are one and the same.

55:22.104 --> 55:24.547
The David Alvarez who's
doing time for the murder

55:24.591 --> 55:25.922
is the same David Alvarez

55:25.945 --> 55:27.942
who was a fellow pupil
of Spector's at the home.

55:28.786 --> 55:30.544
Why was Alvarez convicted?

55:30.950 --> 55:33.344
His DNA on her body.

55:33.708 --> 55:35.572
A subsequent confession.

55:35.866 --> 55:37.584
That's pretty conclusive.

55:38.984 --> 55:40.384
What year is this?

55:40.856 --> 55:43.231
August 2002.

55:44.724 --> 55:46.024
In London.

55:47.544 --> 55:50.189
Now, there's a gap in
Spector's time-line.

55:51.394 --> 55:53.158
We don't know where he was

55:53.435 --> 55:55.033
or what he was doing.

55:56.432 --> 55:58.502
No, we don't.

57:25.274 --> 57:26.866
I'll see you in the morning.

57:27.498 --> 57:28.904
Try and get some sleep.

57:39.184 --> 57:40.564
I'll pray for you.
