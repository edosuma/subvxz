00:01.375 --> 00:03.792
(J.D.) <i>Being a great doctor isn't just</i>
<i>about medical knowledge.</i>

00:03.875 --> 00:05.834
<i>It's also about people skills.</i>

00:05.917 --> 00:08.792
Wow. That is the worst broken nose
I have ever seen.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.834
I'm here because I stepped on a nail.

00:10.917 --> 00:12.166
Of course.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.250
(J.D.) <i>Or you walking on your nose.</i>

00:14.333 --> 00:16.917
Unfortunately, you're gonna have
to wait a little bit longer, ok?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.417
'Cause we admit people
by severity of condition.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.709
That was mortifying.

00:26.792 --> 00:29.000
Aah! My face!

00:29.083 --> 00:32.166
You know, with the face burns,
we could probably admit you now.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.583
Laverne?

00:33.667 --> 00:38.291
(screaming, crying)

00:38.375 --> 00:39.375
Aah!

00:39.458 --> 00:40.667
(J.D.)
<i>My me time hand.</i>

00:40.750 --> 00:42.583
And, too, you know,
Friday night,

00:42.667 --> 00:44.917
there's a chamber orchestra playing
in the courtyard of the museum.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.208
-I would love that.
-You wanna go?

00:46.291 --> 00:47.500
My God, I love Pachelbel.

00:47.583 --> 00:49.500
(J.D.) <i>Carla and Elliot</i>
<i>were going through their weekly ritual</i>

00:49.583 --> 00:51.458
<i>of making plans they were</i>
<i>never going to keep.</i>

00:51.542 --> 00:53.750
-We should have dinner beforehand.
-Perfect.

00:53.834 --> 00:55.709
(J.D.) <i>And since Turk</i>
<i>knew these were fake plans,</i>

00:55.792 --> 00:58.959
<i>he used the opportunity</i>
<i>to score bonus points with his wife.</i>

00:59.041 --> 01:00.291
<i>Classic husbanding.</i>

01:00.375 --> 01:02.500
Hey, baby. You know what?
Forget dinner.

01:02.583 --> 01:04.125
I'll make you
a homemade picnic basket.

01:04.208 --> 01:06.709
-Oh.
-I married an amazing man.

01:06.792 --> 01:10.083
You sure did. You know what?
I've got an even better idea.

01:10.166 --> 01:12.375
Maybe J.D. and I
could both come, right?

01:12.458 --> 01:16.709
We'll wear sport coats and you guys,
beautiful dresses.

01:16.792 --> 01:19.458
-Oh, my God, I love that idea.
-I love it. I love it.

01:19.542 --> 01:22.041
-It's awesome. It's awesome.
-(whooping)

01:22.125 --> 01:24.250
(J.D.)
<i>To be perfectly honest, so did I.</i>

01:24.333 --> 01:27.250
<i>I never get an opportunity to wear</i>
<i>my hounds-tooth sports coat.</i>

01:28.375 --> 01:31.917
<i>Unlike Elliot and Carla, when</i>
<i>Turk and I made plans, we kept them.</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:33.667
It's 10:00. You ready?

01:33.750 --> 01:34.750
Let's do it.

01:34.834 --> 01:38.542
(J.D.) <i>But lately for us, our plans rarely</i>
<i>involved leaving the apartment.</i>

01:42.792 --> 01:44.709
I wasn't too excited
about taking over this spot

01:44.792 --> 01:46.250
after you sat in it for 20 minutes.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.583
But I gotta tell ya,
it's warm in all the right places.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.667
(J.D.) <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:50.750 --> 01:52.291
How do you like what
I left you over there?

01:52.375 --> 01:55.291
Aw, man, your ass
indentation is so deep.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.583
It's like I'm sitting
in a giant inner tube.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.166
(J.D.) <i>As Turk and I recuperated</i>
<i>from our big chair swap,</i>

02:00.250 --> 02:02.583
<i>I wondered what other</i>
<i>couples were doing tonight.</i>

02:02.667 --> 02:04.792
<i>Did I just refer</i>
<i>to Turk and I as a couple?</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:07.750
<i>My point is, I'm sure other</i>
<i>couples were out having fun.</i>

02:10.333 --> 02:11.792
You look so hot.

02:11.875 --> 02:13.667
When's the last time we kissed?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.041
About a month ago.

02:15.125 --> 02:16.709
When was the last time
we had sex?

02:16.792 --> 02:17.834
Yesterday.

02:17.917 --> 02:20.083
What do you say we head
into the bathroom of this place

02:20.166 --> 02:23.250
and lower the health code rating
from an "A" to a "B"?

02:23.333 --> 02:24.583
What do you say?

02:24.667 --> 02:27.834
(J.D.) <i>I guess some people figure,</i>
<i>what's the worst that can happen?</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:31.333
Well?

02:31.417 --> 02:32.709
It's blue.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.583
-I'm not pregnant.
-Oh...

02:35.250 --> 02:37.625
You know what's weird?
I'm relieved.

02:37.709 --> 02:41.875
I just feel kind of sad because I think
about how beautiful our son is,

02:41.959 --> 02:44.417
and I kind of wish it
had gone the other way.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.792
You know?

02:47.041 --> 02:48.709
Sweetie?

02:48.792 --> 02:50.875
She's not pregnant!

02:50.959 --> 02:55.208
It came out blue! It's blue!

02:55.291 --> 02:57.667
She's not pregnant!

02:57.750 --> 03:01.208
It's blue! It came out blue!

03:01.291 --> 03:04.750
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

03:04.834 --> 03:08.667
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:11.500 --> 03:13.166
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

03:14.959 --> 03:17.542
The EPI isn't working.
I still don't have a rhythm.

03:17.625 --> 03:19.750
Transcutaneous pacer
isn't capturing.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.375
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
I'm calling it.

03:24.458 --> 03:27.041
Time of death, 9:17.

03:27.125 --> 03:31.208
I always thought that when I died, I'd see
a bright light or float above the ground.

03:31.291 --> 03:33.709
It turns out death
is pretty mundane.

03:33.792 --> 03:36.458
I guess sometimes
the end is just the end.

03:36.542 --> 03:39.333
For the last time, Jerry,
you're not dead, ok?

03:39.417 --> 03:41.000
Now, go back to your room.

03:43.083 --> 03:46.458
Jerry has Cotard's,
or walking corpse syndrome.

03:46.542 --> 03:49.125
The guy thinks he's dead
even though he's walking around.

03:49.792 --> 03:52.667
(J.D.) <i>I think I'll try to ask Turk</i>
<i>something telepathically.</i>

03:52.750 --> 03:54.125
<i>Hey, man, you wanna do</i>
<i>something tonight?</i>

03:54.208 --> 03:56.500
Dude, yeah. Let's hang out
and watch some TV.

03:56.583 --> 03:57.625
We got any beer?

03:57.709 --> 04:00.458
I think I used the last of it
to make our special party ice.

04:00.542 --> 04:03.542
Hey, if I accidentally put beer
cubes in my orange juice again,

04:03.625 --> 04:06.125
there's gonna be trouble. I almost
got a D.U.I. because of you guys.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.750
Dr. Mickhead was wondering
if you would cover his patient in 310.

04:09.834 --> 04:13.125
The guy was in some bar fight and
has been unconscious since he got there.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.917
He was brought in by some brother
from Ireland.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.333
You mean an Irish brother
or an Irish brother?

04:27.041 --> 04:29.458
Top of the mizzle to you,
me lizzles.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.750
I mean his sibling.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.417
Aw, man.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.792
And you must be
the Irish brother.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.792
No, sir. Ron Peterson,
Ohio born and bred.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.500
Yep. Red-Stater
and proud of it.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.083
Oh, sorry. We--

04:52.166 --> 04:54.166
Oh, only taking
the piss out of ya, lads.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.458
Name's Billy Callahan.

04:55.542 --> 04:57.709
Had you going with the American accent,
though, didn't I?

04:57.792 --> 04:59.500
I'll just put it out there.
Do us a favor.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.709
Is there any chance I could get one
of these filled with Guinness?

05:02.792 --> 05:04.583
I have an awful hangover.
Me-head is splitting.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.208
We had a late night
last night as you can see.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.041
And I'm a bit shaky.
Is there any chance?

05:08.125 --> 05:10.375
Probably not.
We don't usually do that.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.917
No? Ok.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.333
Carla, I'm so bummed.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.917
I can't go see
the chamber orchestra tonight.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.208
I totally forgot
I have my Cantonese class.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.417
And I would totally call
and cancel,

05:21.500 --> 05:23.709
but the only thing I know how to say is,
"I'm allergic to peanuts."

05:23.792 --> 05:27.041
Oh, Elliot, I was really
looking forward to this.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.125
Really?
About 5 seconds ago,

05:29.208 --> 05:31.625
you were all giddy about going home
and taking a bath tonight.

05:32.542 --> 05:33.834
Why would you do that to me?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.750
New thing. I'm busting chops.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.208
So, you just forgot
we even had plans?

05:40.291 --> 05:42.625
What's the big deal?
You were flaking on them anyway.

05:42.709 --> 05:46.125
I wasn't.
I have my Cantonese class.

05:46.208 --> 05:48.834
But do you?
Do you really?

05:49.834 --> 05:51.083
Busting chops.

05:53.625 --> 05:57.000
Fine! At least I remembered the plans
well enough to flake on them!

05:57.083 --> 06:00.000
Oh, yeah? Well, if I knew
you were going to flake on them,

06:00.083 --> 06:03.333
I would've never made plans to forget
in the first place, 'cause you--

06:03.417 --> 06:05.792
She's gone, Carla. It's over.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.750
Where the hell have you been
for the last few days?

06:08.834 --> 06:10.583
-Deep sea fishing.
-You hate fishing.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.583
-Went with my buddies.
-You don't have any buddies.

06:12.667 --> 06:16.250
Oh, yeah? Well, we landed a 200-pound
White Marlin off the coast of San Diego.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.250
Interesting. Because that's 3,000 miles

06:18.333 --> 06:20.667
from the natural habitat
of the White Marlin.

06:20.750 --> 06:23.166
Well, perhaps it hopped
a train from Cape Cod.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.291
Why?

06:24.375 --> 06:25.875
I'm busting chops today.
You can ask anybody.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.500
-It's true.
-See?

06:28.709 --> 06:30.917
So, what did you really do,
and why are you limping?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.333
Hey, Perry.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.000
I got a vasectomy.
Do not tell Jordan.

06:34.083 --> 06:38.792
-Welcome back, fisherman!
-Oh, honey, how I missed you.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.458
-Mwah! Hi!
-Ha-ha, hi!

06:42.000 --> 06:43.208
Come on, Billy, just say it.

06:43.291 --> 06:44.792
For the last time, lads, no.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.250
Oh, then perhaps
you're not really Irish.

06:46.333 --> 06:48.125
Fine!

06:48.208 --> 06:52.667
Pink hearts, yellow moons,
orange stars, green clovers.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.375
(J.D.) See, I told you.

06:54.458 --> 06:57.542
-Yeah, he's Irish.
-Yeah, he is. Yeah, he is.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.625
How long you two seeing each other?
You're a great couple.

06:59.709 --> 07:01.834
Oh, no, man,
we're just living together.

07:01.917 --> 07:05.458
Not like living together.
I mean like living together.

07:06.625 --> 07:08.875
Hey, that is a cool tattoo,
my brother.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.875
Oh, yeah, got this when
I snuck onto a plane.

07:10.959 --> 07:12.542
Thought I was going to Belgium,
ended up in Kenya.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.875
Long story short, I
hung out with this tribe.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.834
When the males go through
adolescence they get this tattoo.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.583
It means "alias."

07:19.667 --> 07:21.333
Oh. Why "alias"?

07:21.417 --> 07:22.625
It's their favorite show.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.917
-Oh.
-Oh.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.792
I'm only kidding.
I don't know what it means.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.834
-Jennifer garner.
-Oh, yeah. Obviously.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.041
Enough about me.
What about you lads?

07:29.125 --> 07:31.166
You know, saving lives
here all day every day.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.542
Out at night, giving it a lash,
tearing it up.

07:33.625 --> 07:35.291
You do go out at night,
don't you?

07:37.417 --> 07:39.125
Do you have any 7's?

07:42.792 --> 07:43.959
Turk.

07:51.667 --> 07:53.333
We tear it.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.250
And sometimes lash.
But the hours we work, it's...

07:56.333 --> 07:58.083
It's less tearing and more folding.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.208
-Right.
-Gently folding.

08:00.291 --> 08:02.333
Lads, you'll sleep enough
when you're dead and buried.

08:02.417 --> 08:05.041
You have to get out in the streets.
You have to talk to a stranger.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.458
Drink a beer with breakfast.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.083
Take the ugliest girl home at the party.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.625
Done it! Done that.
That one I've done.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.333
Go traveling to Texas,
you know.

08:13.417 --> 08:15.458
Go line dancing with some married women
that wish they weren't married.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.041
You never know what life
will put in your lap

08:17.125 --> 08:18.709
when you open your arms
and embrace it.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.458
Be surprised what will fall in your lap
when you open up and embrace life.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.333
-Dude.
-Elliot!

08:24.875 --> 08:28.375
He said my eyes looked like the
Irish countryside after a soft rain.

08:28.458 --> 08:30.000
Ahem.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.583
I should go.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.000
That happened very quickly.

08:33.083 --> 08:36.750
Don't even sweat it.
It's Elliot. She's desperate.

08:36.834 --> 08:37.750
Dude.

08:38.959 --> 08:40.125
-Baby!
-What?!

08:40.208 --> 08:41.667
What?
I wasn't gonna do anything.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.208
-He said my hair was curly.
-Your hair is curly.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.583
-(both) Baby!
-Ok.

08:49.375 --> 08:52.959
What did you do around
the apartment while I was gone?

08:53.041 --> 08:55.917
Oh, I turned your little office
into my pajama closet.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.333
I threw out everything
in the refrigerator

08:57.417 --> 08:59.333
that had the word "jerky"
or "whiz" on it.

08:59.417 --> 09:02.750
I got rid of all your clothes that make
you look like you're 20 years old.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.166
Don't worry, I saved
your hockey jerseys,

09:05.250 --> 09:08.542
although I did move them
into my new pajama closet.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.625
And for some reason none of the
remotes work anymore.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.917
-And why are you limping?
-Fishing.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.291
I'm limping from fishing.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.625
I know that limp.

09:19.709 --> 09:21.250
No, Bob. Bob, no.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.709
You just got a vasectomy.

09:22.792 --> 09:25.250
I had mine done back in '68.

09:25.333 --> 09:28.250
Ironically, that was the same year
that Enid discovered pasta

09:28.333 --> 09:30.583
and I discovered I'm not attracted
to enormous women.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.875
I didn't just get a vasectomy.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.959
Come on, soldier.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.917
If I have to force you
to drop your pants, I will.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.375
So tell bobbo,

09:39.458 --> 09:42.000
was it a hard decision
for the two of you to make?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.667
Snip it, doc.
Snip it hard.

09:49.667 --> 09:54.834
Yeah, we really struggled with it.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.792
I don't really care.

10:02.917 --> 10:04.375
All right, love.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.125
(sighs)

10:06.208 --> 10:07.917
Why are you waving?
You're married.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.125
So, what, married people
can't wave now?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.625
They can wave like this...

10:11.917 --> 10:14.291
but you can't wave like this...

10:14.375 --> 10:16.208
I didn't know you were a waving expert.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.208
What plans of ours did you flake on
to go to that waving seminar?

10:19.291 --> 10:22.917
Oh, why are you asking me? Did you forget?
You big plan-forgetter.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.792
Besides, I don't need to
go to a waving seminar

10:24.875 --> 10:27.500
to know that this wave
is internationally known

10:27.583 --> 10:29.917
as "I am a married woman
whose self-esteem has plummeted

10:30.000 --> 10:32.041
because nobody looks
at me anymore,

10:32.125 --> 10:34.709
so I'm acting like
a desperate hussy."

10:34.792 --> 10:36.375
Oh, snap.

10:36.458 --> 10:39.458
-Did you just call me a hussy?
-Desperate hussy.

10:42.709 --> 10:44.250
-Aah!
-Aah!

10:44.333 --> 10:46.166
-Ow! Oh!
-Oh!

10:46.250 --> 10:47.583
-Aah!
-(speaking Spanish)

10:47.667 --> 10:50.250
Whoa, whoa, ladies! Ladies, stop!

10:51.375 --> 10:52.333
Continue.

10:52.417 --> 10:55.583
-Aah!
-Aah!

10:59.542 --> 11:02.375
So, Billy, we're gonna need to get
your brother's insurance information.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.750
Oh, he's not me brother.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.959
I only met the fella last night,
God bless him.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.000
(J.D.) <i>In life, we often make assumptions</i>
<i>that aren't true.</i>

11:10.458 --> 11:13.083
<i>Whether it's assuming you know</i>
<i>how someone's going to react...</i>

11:13.166 --> 11:16.166
Ok... let me have it.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.041
Whatever makes
you happy, sweetie.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.417
I'll see you at home.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.875
-Ow! Oh!
-Oh! Aah!

11:26.959 --> 11:30.041
(J.D.) <i>Or assuming that a little girl from</i>
<i>Connecticut would never fight dirty.</i>

11:30.125 --> 11:31.917
(both screaming)

11:32.000 --> 11:34.041
I'm going in!

11:34.125 --> 11:34.959
Aah! Oh!

11:35.041 --> 11:37.208
(J.D.) <i>The crazy thing is,</i>
<i>most assumptions could be avoided</i>

11:37.291 --> 11:39.542
<i>if you just asked a simple question</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

11:39.625 --> 11:41.417
Well, if you're not his brother,
then who are you?

11:41.500 --> 11:44.834
Me? I'm the bloke that hit him.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.792
Billy, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.792
Lads, it was an accident.
He threw the first punch.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.834
Then I hit him, he slipped,
hit his head on the bar.

12:01.917 --> 12:04.834
Now, listen, where I come from,
you knock someone unconscious,

12:04.917 --> 12:07.125
you stay around,
you make sure they're ok.

12:07.208 --> 12:10.709
Right? So guess what?
I won't be leaving.

12:10.792 --> 12:13.041
Well, then you're gonna have to deal
with me and my partner.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.959
I mean, like my partner,
not like my partner.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.875
Can I talk to you
outside for a second?

12:22.542 --> 12:23.667
How you doing?

12:23.750 --> 12:26.709
Not great, actually.
I'm dead.

12:26.792 --> 12:29.208
Bummer. How long?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.667
4 years next month.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.834
Jeez, that's a nightmare.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.500
I was dead once
for about 10 minutes.

12:35.583 --> 12:37.291
Then me mate Danny
peed on me head.

12:37.375 --> 12:40.000
-Really?
-It's quite a sight to wake up to though.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.625
-Heard you guys were fighting.
-We made up.

12:47.709 --> 12:49.458
No, they didn't.

12:49.542 --> 12:50.667
Chop-busting...

12:51.250 --> 12:53.709
and doc-dusting.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.417
Well, Elliot, you don't look too
banged up about it.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.792
You got your arm around Carla.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.417
My hand is stuck in this rat's nest
that she calls hair.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.166
-Dye-job.
-Got it.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.417
But, chopstick, you gonna
have to buy a new watch.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.375
And, Carla, you may want to borrow
some of my spray-on hair.

13:08.709 --> 13:10.750
-Baby!
-No, dude, forget them.

13:10.834 --> 13:11.667
We have to deal with Billy.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.959
Now, should we call the cops
on this guy or what?

13:14.041 --> 13:15.750
I don't know, man.
He seems cool.

13:15.834 --> 13:18.000
He put a guy in the hospital.
That's a felony.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.000
And as doctors,
we're supposed to report him.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.959
Are you trying to convince me to do
something that you already did?

13:22.041 --> 13:23.709
-'Cause you know that drives me crazy.
-No.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.625
This is a decision
we both need to make,

13:26.709 --> 13:28.750
together, as a team, as a unit.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.291
All right, fine, let's call the cops.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.333
Thank God.

13:32.417 --> 13:34.083
Hello, gentlemen.

13:34.166 --> 13:37.709
We got a call about a felony
from a Dr. Turk.

13:37.792 --> 13:40.333
"Turk" is easier to hear
over the phone.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.542
(J.D.) <i>"Dorian" isn't hard</i>
<i>to hear over the phone,</i>

13:42.625 --> 13:44.792
<i>but I didn't really want</i>
<i>to talk about it with Turk.</i>

13:44.875 --> 13:46.041
<i>When you have a problem</i>
<i>with someone,</i>

13:46.125 --> 13:48.166
<i>you tend to talk</i>
<i>to everyone except them.</i>

13:48.250 --> 13:51.166
I went behind Jordan's back
and got my junk rewired.

13:52.542 --> 13:56.125
She was sweet to me.
Sweet, bobbo.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.750
What the hell
do you make of that?

14:01.500 --> 14:04.375
Carla thinks she's so tough.
You know, she's been around the block.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.625
She's from the block.
Enough about the block!

14:06.709 --> 14:09.500
It's not my fault
my family had an orchard.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.667
For 4 years I've had to listen to Elliot
complain about her problems.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.583
"My parents are too rich."
"I slept with J.D. again."

14:15.667 --> 14:17.250
"Why can't I gain any weight?"

14:17.333 --> 14:19.500
Well, I got problems of my own.
I'm from the block.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.959
I wanted to help her.
I just wish she could've heard me.

14:22.041 --> 14:23.583
Ok, Jerry, you're out.

14:23.667 --> 14:24.875
-Laverne?
-Mm-hmm?

14:24.959 --> 14:25.792
Can I talk to you?

14:25.875 --> 14:28.625
Perry, believe me
when I say I'm proud to welcome you

14:28.709 --> 14:31.750
to what I like to call
the seedless grapes club. But still...

14:31.834 --> 14:36.208
I have just one obvious, and hopefully
chop-busting question...

14:36.291 --> 14:38.542
Why the hell are you talking
to me about this?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.625
(all)
I guess I should be talking to her.

14:47.208 --> 14:49.834
Jordan, Jordan, why aren't
you more upset about this?

14:49.917 --> 14:51.417
Honest to God, I don't get it.

14:51.500 --> 14:54.000
I mean, normally you'd go to your mother's
for a bitch refresher course

14:54.083 --> 14:56.917
and then you'd come right back here,
just swinging for the fences.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.959
You know what?
I'd love to stay and chat,

14:59.041 --> 15:01.667
but if we're late for ballet, Jack won't
get a spot by the bathroom

15:01.750 --> 15:02.875
and then he'll pee in his tights.

15:02.959 --> 15:07.125
I'm sorry, my son is taking ballet?

15:07.709 --> 15:09.709
Come on, Jordan, he's already got
an overbearing mother

15:09.792 --> 15:11.417
and a fairly prominent lisp.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.208
If we stick him in the tights, we might as
well just go ahead

15:14.291 --> 15:16.250
and get him a time share
on fire island.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.834
Oh, I haven't even decided
if I'm gonna make him gay yet.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.166
Oh, I see what this is.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.583
This is the payback, huh?

15:23.667 --> 15:25.750
Perry, I didn't freak out
because you and I

15:25.834 --> 15:27.583
are 2 very independent people
in a relationship

15:27.667 --> 15:29.834
and we don't always
share our feelings.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.709
I didn't get angry
because I'm not surprised.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.500
Let's go ballet.

15:37.041 --> 15:40.041
Do I wish it were different?
Sometimes.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.834
But whatever you and I
have is working,

15:42.917 --> 15:45.208
so I guess I just
have to live with it.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.458
Bye, daddy.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.917
-So how you feeling down there?
-Oh, great. Great.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.125
Reverse it.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.417
See ya, lads.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.000
Oh, man.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.458
I know we feel guilty,
ok, but it's over.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.458
It's not like there's gonna
be any ramifications.

16:14.458 --> 16:18.542
You have one day to come up
with another gorgeous Irishman.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.000
-One day.
-What?

16:21.083 --> 16:24.083
The Todd appreciates hot,
regardless of gender.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.125
I'm glad Billy's gone.
He was such a jerk.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.750
He kept calling me Bonnie.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.125
Bonnie means pretty.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.208
Oh, my God,
I will never love like that again.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.458
You know I wasn't really mad about
Billy or the whole flaking thing.

16:44.542 --> 16:46.709
I remember hugging you
the day of my wedding

16:46.792 --> 16:49.667
and thinking to myself, even though
the other 2 bridesmaids were my sisters,

16:49.750 --> 16:51.750
I felt closer to you.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.291
When did we stop
being best friends?

16:55.375 --> 16:57.333
It feels like it took us so long
to get to that point

16:57.417 --> 16:59.542
and then it's gone away
so quickly, you know?

16:59.625 --> 17:01.125
Well, it's my fault.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.417
I've been burying myself
in being married.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.959
Oh, please, it is your first year.

17:05.041 --> 17:07.959
I should've been the one
to make the extra effort.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.375
So, what now?

17:10.542 --> 17:12.667
-We try harder.
-All right.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.583
Yo, who taught you
how to fight like that?

17:16.291 --> 17:18.667
When you grow up on an Orchard,
you don't have much choice.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.750
-Apple thieves.
-Ah.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.500
What the hell happened to you?

17:31.583 --> 17:34.083
I got them to reverse
the vasectomy.

17:34.166 --> 17:37.000
What an incredibly
normal thing to do.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.125
Jordan, let me talk for a second.

17:39.208 --> 17:43.542
I've been trained for many years
to take any emotion I feel,

17:43.625 --> 17:47.458
push it down, and then let it out
by drinking way too much

17:47.542 --> 17:50.208
and by yelling at the football players
on my TV screen.

17:50.291 --> 17:53.125
And I really thought
I hit the jackpot

17:53.208 --> 17:57.542
when I finally met a woman who was
as disturbed and closed off as I am.

17:57.625 --> 17:58.792
Thank you.

17:58.875 --> 18:03.208
You're welcome.
Still, now I want more. I really do.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.750
I want to talk about things.
Not everything. Not everything.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.709
I definitely don't want
to talk about everything.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.417
For instance, I don't need to know
when you beat up a woman in the park

18:10.500 --> 18:15.333
because her purse is the same color
as yours, but things that matter.

18:15.417 --> 18:18.458
Things that are important
to us as a family.

18:18.542 --> 18:22.583
And I know that there are guys
who bring flowers

18:22.667 --> 18:24.667
and there are guys
who write love songs.

18:26.166 --> 18:27.750
But, Jordan, I'm a guy
sitting in front of you here

18:27.834 --> 18:29.333
with a twice-operated-on penis

18:29.417 --> 18:33.291
that says I want to be a couple
that communicates more openly.

18:33.375 --> 18:36.041
What kind of guy writes love songs?

18:36.125 --> 18:38.625
Guys whose mothers make
them go to ballet class.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.125
Fair enough.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.041
You know how much
I love you.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.458
I love you too.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.083
Ok, now that we're being
all open and honest...

18:52.166 --> 18:54.458
-Yeah.
-I do not want to have any more kids.

18:54.542 --> 18:57.959
-I think you should get the vasectomy.
-Fantastic.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.875
-I warned you!
-What the hell happened?

19:08.959 --> 19:11.125
He woke up and said something snarky,
so I popped him again.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.083
Are you serious?!

19:13.166 --> 19:14.875
-Boo!
-Ah!

19:16.583 --> 19:17.417
Nah.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.542
Oh, you think
scaring people's funny?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.083
Well, good, 'cause you're dying.

19:21.166 --> 19:22.625
John Dorian, you are a doctor.

19:22.709 --> 19:23.667
Well, he started it.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.000
Sorry about your face, man.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.250
Oh, please, I threw the first punch.
It was my fault.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.583
Right, then, I'm off.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.250
Supposed to be
in Florence by midnight.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.542
How the hell are you
gonna do that?

19:34.458 --> 19:37.250
Her apartment's 2 blocks away.
Should be no problem at all.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.667
Hey, we're sorry about the whole
incarceration thing.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.083
No worries.
Life's too short to hold a grudge.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.542
But still, you 2 boys
might want to ask yourselves

19:45.625 --> 19:46.709
why you contacted the authorities

19:46.792 --> 19:48.917
and didn't have the decency
to come and talk to me first.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.291
But I shall let you two partners
figure that out.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.166
By the way,
you're a gorgeous couple.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.417
Good luck to you.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.750
See you, lads!

20:01.083 --> 20:03.333
When I was alive,
I wish I had lived one day

20:03.417 --> 20:05.208
like he lives every day of his life.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.834
Dead people don't talk, Jerry.

(J.D.)
<i>We weren't really mad at Jerry.</i>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.625
<i>What we realized was</i>
<i>that we were jealous of Billy</i>

20:11.709 --> 20:14.667
<i>because he was out living life</i>
<i>and Turk and I weren't.</i>

20:14.750 --> 20:18.000
<i>I guess it's important</i>
<i>not to take life for granted.</i>

20:18.083 --> 20:19.667
<i>Whether it's appreciating</i>
<i>your relationships...</i>

20:19.750 --> 20:22.125
All righty, let's go for
the hat trick there, doc.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.083
-Are you sure?
-Hey, doc, zip it, grip it, and snip it!

20:27.250 --> 20:28.709
(both laughing)

20:28.792 --> 20:30.375
(J.D.)
<i>Or renewing your friendships.</i>

20:31.709 --> 20:32.834
-(snorts)
-I almost peed.

20:32.917 --> 20:34.458
(coughing and laughing)

20:34.542 --> 20:36.250
(J.D.) <i>For Turk and I,</i>
<i>it was important to just get out</i>

20:36.333 --> 20:38.667
<i>and start living life, period.</i>

20:38.750 --> 20:42.250
Buddy, it is almost 1:00 in the morning,
and we have to be at work at 5:00.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.250
I know, but how often do we do this?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.000
You're absolutely right.
Come on.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.959
Do you have any 2's?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.625
Ah, no. Go fish, please.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.125
Do you have any K's?

20:55.208 --> 20:57.667
Please go fish.
