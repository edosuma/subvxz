00:00.420 --> 00:03.620
♪♪

00:08.170 --> 00:10.580
Check me out!

00:12.170 --> 00:13.960
The new uniforms
just came in.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.210
Alan made me
join the team
to work out,

00:16.210 --> 00:18.210
but I am working it.

00:20.210 --> 00:23.120
I still can't believe
you're playing on
a softball team.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.920
Don't you play
with enough soft
white balls at home?

00:28.620 --> 00:30.880
A, never.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.380
B, we're not
playing this afternoon.

00:34.380 --> 00:36.710
We're a man short.
Josh was gonna fill in,

00:36.710 --> 00:38.750
but stupid Gabi
took Josh and his dad out

00:38.750 --> 00:41.080
for a picnic to apologize for
running over his dad's feet.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.210
Do you realize
how selfish you sound?

00:43.210 --> 00:46.420
This is the first time
Josh is spending time
with his dad.

00:46.420 --> 00:48.790
I'm selfish?
What about Josh?

00:48.790 --> 00:50.620
Josh promised
to play in my game

00:50.620 --> 00:53.120
and abandoned me
to spend time with his dad.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.170
Like father
like son.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.960
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.920
How was Josh
gonna play anyway?

00:58.920 --> 01:00.290
Isn't it a gay league?

01:00.290 --> 01:02.750
Yeah, but you don't
have to be gay to play.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.670
We have a don't ask,
don't tell policy.

01:06.170 --> 01:08.620
Hey, you look like
a barrel-chested

01:08.620 --> 01:10.330
aging athlete.
Can you play?

01:12.210 --> 01:14.500
A, thank you.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.500
B, I can't.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.920
I gotta sell
Squirrel Ranger cookies

01:19.920 --> 01:21.580
with my group from church,

01:21.580 --> 01:24.880
but if you buy 20 boxes,
we can talk.

01:24.880 --> 01:27.960
Done.
I'll get you a uniform.

01:27.960 --> 01:30.040
How many "X"s are there
in front of you "L"?

01:33.960 --> 01:37.120
I can't believe this.
I can't believe you are
actually mad at me.

01:37.120 --> 01:40.620
-I am speechless!
-Well, that's a first.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.000
I had one chance
to bond with my father
and you ruined it.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.620
You didn't stop talking
the entire picnic.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.620
Yeah, I only talked
because I was trying
to protect you

01:46.620 --> 01:48.620
from sounding so show-offy.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.670
(scoffing laughs)
Show-offy.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.040
-How was I show-offy?
-How? Oh, okay, let me see.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.670
Uh, blah, blah, blah,
my helicopter.

01:57.670 --> 01:59.040
Blah, blah, blah,
my vineyard.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.330
Blah, blah,
my helicopter to my vineyard.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.920
We get it.
You're rich.

02:04.920 --> 02:07.000
Well, excuse me
for trying to make
my dad proud.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.710
Stop it!
Now, you two need to focus
on what's important.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.080
It's Squirrel Ranger
cookie season!

02:15.830 --> 02:17.000
All right, who wants in?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.250
I got Coco-nutties
and Little Diddles.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.460
-What is going on out here?
-I'll tell you what's going on.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.960
Thanks to her
incessant yammering,

02:24.960 --> 02:26.710
my dad had
a crappy time
at the picnic.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.080
He conveniently remembered
he had a business meeting

02:29.080 --> 02:30.790
and he had
to leave town early.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.620
Yay!

02:32.620 --> 02:35.250
Now you can play
in my game.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.000
Was that selfish?
I don't care.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.830
Yay!

02:38.830 --> 02:41.250

02:46.120 --> 02:48.080

03:00.920 --> 03:03.000
You know, you try
to be a good person--

03:03.000 --> 03:04.960
you try to bring
a father and son together

03:04.960 --> 03:06.670
and then the whole thing
blows up in your face

03:06.670 --> 03:08.040
and you get blamed for it.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.960
-So you're done butting in?
-Yes, I am.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.580
Right after
I trick Josh's dad
into staying in town

03:13.580 --> 03:16.670
and then take him
to Josh's softball game.

03:16.670 --> 03:18.620
We're gonna watch the game.
We'll go out for drinks after,

03:18.620 --> 03:19.960
and then I'll
sneak out the back

03:19.960 --> 03:21.580
and let them have
their father-son moment.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.460
Sounds like a good idea.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.960
What?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.620
Well, obviously the picnic
didn't go well

03:27.620 --> 03:28.880
so you want to give
Josh and his dad

03:28.880 --> 03:30.830
a chance to try again.
I think it's a good move.

03:30.830 --> 03:31.960
W-- wait a minute.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.880
You are never on board
with my plans,

03:33.880 --> 03:35.880
which makes me feel
like I shouldn't do it.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.790
So I'm not gonna do it.
I'm staying home.

03:37.790 --> 03:40.920
Okay, whatever
you think is best.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.250
Whatever I think is--
Oh, no, uh-huh.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.250
I'm on to you, Sofia.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.960
You're just using
reverse psychology on me

03:46.960 --> 03:49.500
so I'm gonna use reverse,
reverse psychology on you,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.830
which means I am
going to pick up Josh's dad.

03:51.830 --> 03:54.830
Or should I say I'm not
not going to pick him up?

03:55.750 --> 03:57.750
-I said it was a good--
-Oh my God, shut up!

03:57.750 --> 03:59.880
I am sick of your negativity!

04:01.330 --> 04:04.120
Can I interest you in some
Squirrel Ranger cookies?

04:04.120 --> 04:05.750
Nope, I'm good,

04:05.750 --> 04:08.080
but if you ask Sofia,
she'll say she doesn't want any,

04:08.080 --> 04:09.580
which means she does.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.790
Ooh, you got
any snickerdoodles?

04:12.790 --> 04:15.880
Snicker, please.
You know I do.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.620
All right.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.250
Since when are you
a pack leader for
the Squirrel Rangers?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.830
Uh, since I found out
that the pack leader

04:22.830 --> 04:26.710
who sells the most cookies
wins a cruise to Bora Bora.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.960
Wow, what do the girls get?

04:28.960 --> 04:30.290
Who cares?

04:30.290 --> 04:32.920
I'll be on my cruise,

04:32.920 --> 04:35.750
but not if I don't
sell 800 more boxes
by this weekend.

04:36.920 --> 04:38.790
Too bad I'm
not in your group.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.750
You were a Squirrel Ranger?

04:40.750 --> 04:43.960
Oh, I wasn't
"a" Squirrel Ranger.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.500
I was the best Squirrel Ranger
in all of Miami.

04:47.710 --> 04:49.790
If a girl tried to
sell cookies on my turf,

04:49.790 --> 04:51.750
Lil' So-So would
go Scarface on her ass.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.920
I was the cookie
kingpin, chica.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.710
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

05:00.710 --> 05:02.880
When you're nine,
cute, and me,

05:02.880 --> 05:05.040
you can sell anything
to anybody.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.000
Mm-hmm.

05:11.830 --> 05:14.000
You have any interest
in going to Bora Bora?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.420
Hell, yeah, I do.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.880
(crowd cheers, applauds)

05:29.330 --> 05:31.580
Okay, here we are.

05:31.580 --> 05:34.790
Nothing better
for a father-son bonding
softball game

05:34.790 --> 05:36.120
than an ice cold beer

05:36.120 --> 05:37.790
in a carefully
concealed sippy cup.

05:39.710 --> 05:42.040
Bases aren't the only thing
that are about to get loaded.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.500
I just don't get
why Josh wanted me

05:44.500 --> 05:45.750
to come to
his softball game?

05:45.750 --> 05:47.000
All he talked about
at the picnic

05:47.000 --> 05:48.880
was how great he's done
in life without me.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.920
Clearly, he's trying
to send me a message.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.000
That's why I left early.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.620
I knew it wasn't me.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.170
Look, Gabi,
I'm just gonna say it.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.420
I keep having
this feeling that Josh
knows nothing about this

05:59.420 --> 06:02.250
-and bringing me here
was your idea.
-W-- what?

06:02.250 --> 06:05.290
You think I would
risk my relationship with Josh

06:05.290 --> 06:09.170
by interfering in
this very fragile
father-son relationship?

06:09.170 --> 06:11.880
Well, you did it before
when you picked me
up at the airport.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.380
Exactly, yes.
So what, you think
I'd do it again?

06:14.380 --> 06:16.540
What am I? A fool?

06:16.540 --> 06:19.290
Matt, Josh felt so bad
about what happened before

06:19.290 --> 06:21.500
and he wanted a second chance
to connect with you.

06:21.500 --> 06:22.750
So that's why
he brought you here.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.670
He wanted you
to see the real him.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.540
Okay, maybe this
was a good idea.

06:29.540 --> 06:31.170
Thank you.

06:31.170 --> 06:33.620
I mean, you know,
thank Josh

06:33.620 --> 06:35.830
'cause he's the one
who came up with it.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.290
Josh, you're up.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.710
Oh, stop, quick,
turn around.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.120
Why?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.620
Just 'cause.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.960
-Looking good.
-Why, thank you.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.000
I had the jersey tapered
to accentuate my "V."

06:58.000 --> 07:00.290
No, I don't want
to see your "V."

07:02.620 --> 07:05.170
-Good luck, new guy.
-I don't need luck.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.880
I'm gonna drive
this so deep.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.580
(chuckles)
From your lips.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.040
All right, play ball.

07:18.830 --> 07:22.750
(cheering)

07:25.750 --> 07:29.380
-This is amazing.
-I know.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.540
It's all so clear now.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.330
Now I know why Josh
wanted me to be here.

07:32.330 --> 07:34.960
It's like you said.
He wanted me to see
the real him.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.670
-Yes!
-I am so proud of him.

07:37.670 --> 07:41.290
-Yes!
-He was afraid to
tell me he was gay.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.670
Yes! Yes!

07:44.420 --> 07:45.580
Wait, what?

07:48.620 --> 07:50.460
All right, that's enough
of the butt slaps.

07:50.460 --> 07:51.830
Sorry, boss.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.500
(chanting)
Josh! Josh! Josh! Josh!

07:54.500 --> 07:56.750
Josh! Josh! Josh!
Josh! Josh!

07:56.750 --> 07:58.000
Josh! Josh! Josh!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.750
Josh, Josh, Josh!

07:59.750 --> 08:01.670
Hey, I need
to talk to you.

08:01.670 --> 08:03.710
-Gabi, what are you doing here?
-Well, before I answer that,

08:03.710 --> 08:06.710
I need you to know
I only did it because
I care about you.

08:08.080 --> 08:09.500
What did you do?

08:09.500 --> 08:11.500
Well, I felt really bad
about the picnic,

08:11.500 --> 08:13.580
-so I stopped your
dad from leaving...
-What?

08:13.580 --> 08:14.830
-...and then
I brought him here.
-What?

08:14.830 --> 08:16.540
Will you stop
interrupting me?

08:16.540 --> 08:17.920
When you hit
that home run,
your dad--

08:17.920 --> 08:19.620
-Josh!
-Damn it.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.710
I'm so proud of you.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.460
You are?

08:24.460 --> 08:27.420
-Josh, Josh, Josh--
-Not now, Gabi.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.120
My dad's proud of me.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.380
-You were saying, Matt?
-Seeing you out here today,

08:31.380 --> 08:33.790
buddy, what can I say?
I'm blown away.

08:33.790 --> 08:36.380
Oh, it's nothing really.

08:36.380 --> 08:38.080
I've been hitting dingers
since seventh grade.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.000
I want you to know, pal,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.040
you are so darn courageous.

08:44.710 --> 08:45.580
Bring it in.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.330
We got so much to talk about.
I'm gonna call my office

08:50.330 --> 08:51.540
and cancel all my meetings

08:51.540 --> 08:53.460
because I want
to hang out with my son

08:53.460 --> 08:55.330
and hear his whole story.

08:58.710 --> 09:00.670
My dad's proud of me.

09:02.830 --> 09:05.000
All it took
was a home run, Gabi.
Who knew?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.290
-Uh-huh.
-Thank you for brining him.

09:07.290 --> 09:09.210
Yeah.

09:10.620 --> 09:11.920
Your dad thinks your gay.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.500
What?

09:17.210 --> 09:18.790
Why does my dad
think I'm gay?

09:18.790 --> 09:20.580
Well, the whole crowd is,

09:20.580 --> 09:22.670
and the teams are
the San Fransisco Bears

09:22.670 --> 09:24.500
versus the Field of Queens.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.210
So...

09:26.210 --> 09:28.580
Naturally, he just
kind of assumed you were

09:28.580 --> 09:30.790
and then I agreed with him
and didn't tell him you weren't.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.460
What?
Why would you do that?

09:32.460 --> 09:34.540
Because I knew how much
you wanted to connect with him

09:34.540 --> 09:36.540
and then he finally
felt connected to you,

09:36.540 --> 09:37.580
and I didn't want
to ruin that.

09:37.580 --> 09:40.080
-I mean, what was
I supposed to do?
-Well, not say that.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.620
Now you've made things
more uncomfortable

09:41.620 --> 09:43.710
between me and him
because now I got to
tell him the truth.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.040
-Do you?
-Josh.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.710
I changed my flight.

09:47.710 --> 09:49.330
Now that this wall
is down between us,

09:49.330 --> 09:51.250
I can't wait
to spend time with you,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.710
so I got us two tickets
to Wicked.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.670
Look, Matt, I got
to be honest with you.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.790
Wicked's my favorite musical.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.670
That's so good.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.750
Oh, my damn, Sofia,
you look amazing.

10:13.750 --> 10:17.040
I look exactly like I did
when I was nine.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.380
Told you I was cute.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.500
It's time to turn
that cute into loot.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
Yeah.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.080
Hey, buddy,
it looks like you
got the munchies.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.460
You buy ten boxes,
you get one free.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.420
And if I sell enough cookies,
I win a trip to science camp.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.960
Bible camp?
Torah camp.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.580
Shalom.

10:53.580 --> 10:56.710
Hey, buddy,
who's never seen
me before,

10:56.710 --> 10:59.540
you look like
you have the munchies.

10:59.540 --> 11:01.380
You buy ten boxes,
you get one free.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.460
Now go find
your mama's purse

11:11.460 --> 11:14.540
and bring little So-So
some crisp hundies.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.500
Comprende?

11:18.540 --> 11:21.120
Buy ten boxes,
get one free.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.500
It's in your back pocket.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.620
Why are you
still wearing that?

11:34.620 --> 11:36.880
I can't take it off.

11:36.880 --> 11:40.330
I walk down the street.
People point. People stare.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.960
It's like I'm a celebrity.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.420
People probably think you're
the Pillsbury Dough Girl.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.500
Hee-hee!

11:50.000 --> 11:52.750
The point is,
people are digging me

11:52.750 --> 11:54.290
and I am loving it.

11:54.290 --> 11:57.710
I am never going
to get it dirty
so I can wear it forever.

11:57.710 --> 12:00.080
Uh, but what about
when you're playing softball?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.170
Oh, I never play.

12:02.170 --> 12:05.000
I sit on the bench
and I look sexy,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.540
and when it
gets close to my turn,
I got to the bathroom.

12:10.040 --> 12:15.250
No! My softball costume!

12:15.250 --> 12:17.380
Oh.

12:17.380 --> 12:20.420
Come on, take it off.
I got some vodka in
the laundry room.

12:20.420 --> 12:22.210
Does vodka get out stains?

12:22.210 --> 12:23.500
No, but I'm gonna need some

12:23.500 --> 12:25.710
if I'm gonna see you
without that shirt.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.960
Hey, guys, did you
have fun at Wicked?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.500
Oh, you know it.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.830
That song "Defying Gravity"
defies gravity.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.120
It's sad you have
to leave so soon.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.960
I know, but I'm gonna
see you on the Fourth of July.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.580
-Right, buddy?
-You bet. I'll bring
the sparkles.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.330
I don't know how,
but that actually worked.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.710
I'm not gonna say you owe
your entire relationship

12:55.710 --> 12:58.250
with your father to me,
so you can say it.

12:58.250 --> 13:01.080
Gabi, you are a genius.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.880
You know, a week ago,
I didn't even know my dad,

13:02.880 --> 13:04.420
and now he's
part of my life.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.330
I get to see him on the fourth,
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

13:07.330 --> 13:10.250
So you just have
to be holiday gay.

13:10.250 --> 13:12.250
Holli-gay, if you will.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.120
But, Gabi,
I got to be straight with you.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.290
-What's wrong?
-No, no.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.040
I got to be straight with you.
Take off our clothes.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.920
I'm using the punch card.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.330
Welcome back,
straight Josh.

13:23.330 --> 13:25.500
I'm sorry,
I forgot my--

13:26.540 --> 13:28.500
Oh my God.

13:28.500 --> 13:31.750
Matt, it's not
what it looks like.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.620
I can't believe it.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.500
Gabi's a man?

13:45.080 --> 13:47.620
-I am obviously not a man!
-Okay, I didn't know.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.330
I was trying to be open-minded.

13:49.330 --> 13:51.250
I watch Transparent.

13:52.210 --> 13:54.290
You probably want to know
what's going on.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.500
Gabi?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.290
Josh?

14:00.290 --> 14:01.960
Gabi!

14:01.960 --> 14:04.250
-Josh.
-Will one of you please
tell me what's going on?

14:04.250 --> 14:07.540
Okay, look, Matt, I-- I haven't
been completely honest with you.

14:10.330 --> 14:11.380
(clears throat)

14:11.380 --> 14:13.620
I was just so happy
that we were bonding,

14:13.620 --> 14:15.290
I didn't want anything
to mess it up,

14:15.290 --> 14:17.380
but the truth is...

14:17.380 --> 14:19.210
(breathes deeply)

14:19.210 --> 14:20.620
I'm straight.

14:22.250 --> 14:23.420
What?

14:24.880 --> 14:27.120
Why would you lie to me?

14:28.500 --> 14:31.500
-Gabi?
-Um, well.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.250
At first you guys
didn't connect,

14:33.250 --> 14:35.330
but when you found out
he was gay, you did.

14:35.330 --> 14:37.460
And so that made it
incredibly difficult

14:37.460 --> 14:40.670
for him to tell you that he is,
in fact, an openly straight
heterosexual man.

14:42.250 --> 14:44.040
I can't believe this.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.540
Do you know
how hard it was

14:46.540 --> 14:48.120
for me to come out
here and meet you?

14:48.120 --> 14:51.830
Uh, probably as hard as it was
for me to meet you.

14:51.830 --> 14:53.830
I come out here
to get to know my son

14:53.830 --> 14:55.920
and you lie to me
and disrespect our relationship

14:55.920 --> 14:57.920
-like it means nothing.
-Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.580
You want to
talk about a relationship
that means nothing?

15:00.580 --> 15:03.040
How about you abandoning me
30 years ago,

15:03.040 --> 15:04.420
and not once trying
to contact me?

15:04.420 --> 15:06.330
-Josh.
-No, how about the fact
that all of my other friends

15:06.330 --> 15:07.540
had dads and I didn't.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.170
You never taught me
how to fish or how to drive

15:10.170 --> 15:11.830
or how to unhook bras.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.080
I don't think dads do that.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.330
Well, I wouldn't know
because I never had a dad.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.670
God-- I-- I--
I think I'd just--
I'd better leave.

15:22.670 --> 15:25.040
Of course you do
because that's what
you do best, leave.

15:30.290 --> 15:32.920
Josh, I'm so sorry.
Do you want me to
go talk to him?

15:32.920 --> 15:34.250
No, I don't want
you to talk to him.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.710
I don't want
you to talk to me.
Just butt out, Gabi.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.750
I miss gay Josh.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.880
Baby, we did it.
We won.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.540
(cheers)

15:56.540 --> 15:58.460
Bora Bora, here we come.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.210
Ooh, yes.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.120
Sorry about the ceremony
taking so long.

16:02.120 --> 16:05.120
All those Squirrel Rangers
speeches and songs,

16:05.120 --> 16:07.040
so bora-boring.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.000
Ooh, I can't wait to have
a big old pina colada.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.420
I can't wait to have
a big ol' pina in Yolanda.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.920
I'm gonna get us
some champagne.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.670
Oh, don't bother.
I have something stronger
in my room.

16:17.670 --> 16:20.040
-(knocking)
-Ms. Perkins?

16:20.040 --> 16:23.460
Yolanda, you left
the ceremony without
your cruise tickets.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.040
(laughing)
I did.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.880
I was just so caught up with
all those songs and speeches.

16:30.250 --> 16:34.080
Can I just say you make
me proud to be a part
of this organization?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.080
Your hard work
is an inspiration
to those girls.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.170
Sofia:
Who's ready
for some tequila?

16:43.080 --> 16:45.540
Is that Squirrel Ranger
drinking alcohol?

16:46.540 --> 16:48.880
Sofia, this is Ms. Perkins,

16:48.880 --> 16:51.040
the regional director
for the Squirrel Rangers.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.420
Um, you know what,
this is actually okay

16:53.420 --> 16:55.460
because I look young,
but I'm actually 24.

16:55.460 --> 16:58.460
So you're impersonating
a Squirrel Ranger?

16:59.540 --> 17:02.000
Uh, what's worse?
Impersonating a Squirrel Ranger

17:02.000 --> 17:04.080
or being a drunk
nine-year-old?

17:06.120 --> 17:09.120
Sofia,
I can't believe this.
You tricked me.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.670
Sandy,
I had no knowledge
of this.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.170
And given the situation,

17:16.170 --> 17:18.460
I think that you and I
should go on this cruise.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.500
I don't think so.

17:20.500 --> 17:23.040
You've disgraced
the Squirrel Rangers.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.920
Now hand over your sash.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.040
-Damn it.
-Sash!

17:27.040 --> 17:28.170
She said sash!

17:30.710 --> 17:32.620
Thank God.
You can have this.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.380
Oh, my damn.

17:42.920 --> 17:43.920
(sighs)

17:43.920 --> 17:46.000
Want to smoke some of that
and eat a bunch of cookies?

17:47.540 --> 17:51.000
When they go low,
we get high.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.330
What's all this?

18:02.170 --> 18:05.120
I wanted to extend
an olive brunch.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.040
You get it?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.830
It'll hit you later.

18:11.830 --> 18:14.460
Listen, I just--
I wanted to apologize

18:14.460 --> 18:16.250
about everything
that happened with your dad.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.620
Look, it wasn't
all your fault.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.170
I mean,
I went along
with the plan.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.040
Yeah, but I started it.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.750
I want you to know
that I'm done butting in.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.710
You know, after thinking
of everything you did

18:24.710 --> 18:26.080
to get you and
your dad together,

18:26.080 --> 18:28.290
I realized that you can't
force people to connect.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.540
(knocking)

18:30.540 --> 18:33.120
You know,
not every relationship
has a happy ending.

18:35.380 --> 18:37.210
You better be here
to give Josh a happy ending!

18:39.210 --> 18:41.620
No-- no-- not like that.
I didn't do this.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.120
I couldn't leave
things like that.

18:47.120 --> 18:50.540
Josh, I just want to
say that you were right
about everything

18:50.540 --> 18:52.120
and I am really sorry.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.380
I have no excuse
for abandoning you
and your mom.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.380
You were young
and terrified
and confused.

18:56.380 --> 18:58.080
-Both: Gabi.
-Okay.

18:58.080 --> 18:59.750
When Gabi told me
you were gay,

18:59.750 --> 19:02.540
I thought I could
swoop in and be the cool
accepting dad you never had.

19:02.540 --> 19:04.210
That way, it'd make up
for a little of the time

19:04.210 --> 19:06.170
-I wasn't there for you.
-Yeah.

19:06.170 --> 19:09.080
I think maybe we just
put a little too much
pressure on ourselves too,

19:09.080 --> 19:11.290
trying to make up for
30 years in two days.

19:11.290 --> 19:13.830
Maybe we did.
What if I stuck around
for an extra day?

19:13.830 --> 19:15.620
We could go fishing,
catch a game.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.880
Actually, and I kid you not,

19:18.880 --> 19:20.960
you know what
I'd like to do?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.830
See Wicked again.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.710
So would I!

19:25.750 --> 19:27.540
-It was surprisingly great.
-Right?!

19:27.540 --> 19:29.210
Such a fresh twist
on a classic tale.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.250
Tell you what.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.880
Why don't we go
enjoy Gabi's brunch?

19:33.880 --> 19:35.830
-I'll get us tickets.
-That'd be great.

19:35.830 --> 19:37.880
See if you can
get us house seats.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.330
Come on, you're rich.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.080
Looks like everything
worked out,

19:42.080 --> 19:43.830
which means butting in
does work.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.290
Not every time...

19:46.290 --> 19:47.960
but most times.

19:54.830 --> 19:56.750
Argh! Oh.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.920
Oh, my back!

19:58.920 --> 20:01.580
Whew, I can't play.

20:01.580 --> 20:03.080
Who's left on the bench?

20:04.960 --> 20:06.120
Elliot!

20:06.120 --> 20:08.920
Uh, I have to go
to the bathroom.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.880
No, no, no, Elliot,
we need you.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.580
For what?
A fro-yo run?

20:13.670 --> 20:15.460
It's the bottom of the ninth,
two outs.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.830
We're down a run
and the bases are loaded.

20:17.830 --> 20:20.420
I don't know what
any of that means.

20:20.420 --> 20:24.210
Just go stand there
and get hit by a pitch.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.420
But then my softball costume
will get dirty,

20:28.420 --> 20:30.620
and it's so beautiful.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.460
Look, it's whiter than
a Mumford & Sons concert.

20:34.710 --> 20:36.620
Just take one for the team.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.170
I can't!

20:48.670 --> 20:52.540
(triumphant music playing)
