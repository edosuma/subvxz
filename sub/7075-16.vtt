WEBVTT

00:02.007 --> 00:03.945
It`s H, O... H, A, W, T...

00:03.945 --> 00:05.839
Guys! What happened?

00:05.874 --> 00:07.330
Apparently they found him unconscious

00:07.331 --> 00:08.593
on a park bench.

00:08.851 --> 00:10.023
Oh, Meu Deus!

00:10.042 --> 00:10.846
Is he okay?

00:10.847 --> 00:12.666
We don't know. We just got here.

00:12.862 --> 00:14.546
He's ready for visitors now.

00:14.547 --> 00:16.018
He's in 1023.

00:18.637 --> 00:19.633
Hi.

00:19.912 --> 00:22.338
Oh, welcome, my old friends.

00:23.246 --> 00:24.933
- Welcome.
- Pierce, what happened?

00:24.934 --> 00:26.659
We were all so worried.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.573
It was the pills.

00:27.574 --> 00:28.865
They just took me over.

00:28.866 --> 00:33.346
I saw awful, horrible things,
demons, aliens,

00:33.347 --> 00:37.399
critters 3, something called
Bruce Willis surrogates.

00:38.575 --> 00:39.821
Abed, what are you guys doing?

00:42.044 --> 00:43.346
Pierce asked me to document his life

00:43.347 --> 00:44.999
for historical purposes.

00:45.092 --> 00:46.890
At first, I said, "no," because at the risk

00:46.891 --> 00:48.684
of sounding overly sensitive,
I feel intensely bored

00:48.685 --> 00:50.318
by Pierce as a subject.

00:50.604 --> 00:52.309
But I'm excited about
the narrative facility

00:52.310 --> 00:53.642
of the documentary format.

00:53.643 --> 00:54.793
It's easier to tell a complex story

00:54.794 --> 00:55.574
when you can just cut to people

00:55.575 --> 00:57.081
explaining things to the camera.

00:57.082 --> 00:58.946
I've called everyone here so that I could

00:58.947 --> 01:00.386
put my house in order,

01:00.387 --> 01:04.790
bequeath parting gifts, say my final words

01:04.791 --> 01:05.972
to each of you.

01:05.973 --> 01:07.386
Final words?

01:07.623 --> 01:09.388
- You're gonna kill us?
- No, dummy.

01:09.389 --> 01:11.161
The pills wiped me out.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.488
I'm dying.

01:14.421 --> 01:15.421
Oh.

01:15.764 --> 01:17.191
I'm not really dying.

01:17.892 --> 01:19.884
Over the last few weeks,
it's become apparent

01:19.885 --> 01:22.483
how little respect this group has for me.

01:23.182 --> 01:27.105
So I've summoned them
here to exact my revenge.

01:27.319 --> 01:29.569
See? Fish in a barrel.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:57.069 --> 01:59.010
I'm so sad. I don't know what to do.

01:59.011 --> 02:00.194
Usually, if I need to cheer up,

02:00.195 --> 02:02.104
I just make fun of Pierce, but now...

02:02.633 --> 02:04.041
It'd just make me sadder.

02:04.397 --> 02:06.124
It's Gregory Hines all over again.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.571
Look, I'm sure he'll be fine.

02:07.572 --> 02:09.695
You know how dramatic Pierce gets.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.491
Remember when he had the hiccups

02:10.491 --> 02:12.049
and pulled the fire alarm?

02:12.050 --> 02:13.075
Let's just try to relax.

02:13.076 --> 02:14.632
He's here because we relaxed.

02:14.633 --> 02:16.371
No, he's here because he relaxed,

02:16.372 --> 02:18.150
a handful of pills at a time.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.144
That's all over now.

02:20.145 --> 02:21.758
We're here for him, so there's no point

02:21.759 --> 02:22.949
in feeling bad.

02:22.998 --> 02:24.206
We know there's no point, Jeff.

02:24.207 --> 02:25.815
We kind of just felt like feeling it.

02:25.816 --> 02:27.723
Yeah, Jeff. What are you? Abed?

02:27.724 --> 02:28.723
Oh, sorry, Abed.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.166
No problem. Doesn't bother me.

02:30.167 --> 02:33.168
Mr. Hawthorne is ready
to commence his bequeathings.

02:34.418 --> 02:36.374
Shouldn't you be telling that
to an orderly?

02:36.453 --> 02:38.054
He's gonna give us gifts.

02:38.055 --> 02:39.203
Oh, cool!

02:40.165 --> 02:41.145
I mean...

02:42.550 --> 02:43.561
Cool.

02:43.694 --> 02:45.154
I don't want Pierce to die.

02:45.302 --> 02:48.142
But if I'm gonna get bequeathed upon,

02:48.143 --> 02:50.459
I'd like to be bequeathed a drum kit

02:50.734 --> 02:53.074
or a signed photo of actor Levar Burton.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.815
Those would be my top two wishes.

02:54.816 --> 02:57.299
My third wish would be a million wishes.

02:58.097 --> 02:59.558
But I'd just use 'em all on

02:59.559 --> 03:01.817
a million signed photos
of actor Levar Burton.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.353
Hello, Pierce.

03:04.896 --> 03:05.629
Hi.

03:05.630 --> 03:07.761
I got you some things from the gift shop

03:07.762 --> 03:08.534
to cheer you up.

03:08.535 --> 03:10.301
I got you a John Grisham novel

03:10.302 --> 03:12.232
and a funny little coffee mug.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.491
You see how the flea's door mat
says "Dog, sweet dog"?

03:14.492 --> 03:16.644
Yeah. Shirley, we both know

03:16.645 --> 03:18.761
that you and I are the most hated
in the group.

03:18.762 --> 03:19.689
We do?

03:19.690 --> 03:22.761
And since, in my absence,
you'll be the new black sheep...

03:22.921 --> 03:24.948
I'm sorry. That's offensive.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.309
Black swan.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.128
I want you to have this.

03:28.129 --> 03:30.474
It's a compact record and it

03:30.962 --> 03:33.302
contains an audio file of your study group

03:33.303 --> 03:35.588
talking about you while
you're out of the room.

03:35.646 --> 03:38.007
It's all here, burnt into this diskette

03:38.008 --> 03:39.247
by optical lasers.

03:39.248 --> 03:40.087
I don't believe you.

03:40.088 --> 03:41.964
I know it sounds like science fiction.

03:41.965 --> 03:44.094
No, I don't believe
there's anything on that.

03:44.413 --> 03:47.706
Then I guess this is good-bye...Forever.

03:48.732 --> 03:50.306
Good... good-bye, Pierce.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.351
Smell you later.

03:57.637 --> 03:58.959
He said it's a recording of you all

03:58.960 --> 04:00.388
talking behind my back.

04:00.389 --> 04:01.378
That's ridiculous.

04:01.379 --> 04:02.252
That's what I told him,

04:02.253 --> 04:03.939
because you all don't do that.

04:03.998 --> 04:05.049
Right?

04:10.775 --> 04:13.777
Mr. Hawthorne is requesting "sour face."

04:17.918 --> 04:18.560
Knock, knock.

04:18.562 --> 04:19.973
Is that you, Death?

04:19.974 --> 04:21.539
- It's Britta.
- Oh.

04:21.540 --> 04:23.204
Before you speak, I just want to tell you

04:23.205 --> 04:24.764
that you don't have to give me anything.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.207
I am happy to just spend time with you.

04:27.564 --> 04:29.185
You know what Dylan Thomas
said about death?

04:29.186 --> 04:30.303
No, tell me.

04:30.568 --> 04:31.653
Okay, bluff called.

04:31.866 --> 04:34.331
Britta, you're the selfless one
in the group, right?

04:34.332 --> 04:36.330
I wouldn't know.
I haven't thought about myself in years.

04:36.331 --> 04:38.488
That's what makes you
the perfect recipient

04:38.489 --> 04:39.516
of this bequeathment.

04:39.517 --> 04:41.415
It's a check for $10,000

04:41.741 --> 04:43.487
with the payee line blank,

04:43.581 --> 04:46.478
so that you can give it
to the charity of your choice.

04:46.479 --> 04:47.406
Wow.

04:47.727 --> 04:51.749
Pierce, this is... surprising.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.623
After what you gave Shirley,

04:53.624 --> 04:55.373
we thought you were playing mind games.

04:55.374 --> 04:56.365
Thank you.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.738
Of course, if you are so inclined,

05:01.739 --> 05:03.687
you could always write
your own name in there.

05:07.545 --> 05:08.560
Toodles.

05:09.085 --> 05:10.879
I don't want to die in a place like this.

05:11.124 --> 05:12.196
People shouldn't die in the same place

05:12.197 --> 05:13.321
as People magazines do.

05:13.322 --> 05:15.315
I hope to die surrounded by my family.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.556
That's the only way I agreed to be

05:16.557 --> 05:17.579
surrounded by my family.

05:17.580 --> 05:18.919
Me and Abed have an agreement.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.331
If one of us dies, we stage it to look

05:20.332 --> 05:22.359
like a suicide caused
by the unjust cancellation

05:22.360 --> 05:23.548
of Firefly.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.732
We're gonna get that show back
on the air, buddy.

05:27.793 --> 05:28.807
How'd it go?

05:29.142 --> 05:30.116
Huh?

05:30.208 --> 05:31.144
Oh, fine.

05:31.145 --> 05:32.642
He gave me a check for $10,000

05:32.643 --> 05:34.773
to give to the charity of my choice.

05:35.057 --> 05:36.727
See? He's not messing with us.

05:36.728 --> 05:38.952
- Maybe he just hates Shirley.
- What?

05:38.953 --> 05:40.365
Yeah, maybe.

05:41.168 --> 05:42.788
I just need to research a few charities,

05:42.789 --> 05:44.721
because some take a lot off the top

05:44.722 --> 05:46.320
and you think you're giving money to people

05:46.321 --> 05:47.944
that really need it,
and you're really giving it

05:47.945 --> 05:51.785
to some middle man
who's gonna pay off their parking tickets,

05:51.786 --> 05:53.843
credit cards, and keep
from getting kicked out

05:53.844 --> 05:56.988
of her place in... April.

05:57.209 --> 05:58.226
Ah!

05:58.611 --> 06:00.316
He'd like to see Annie next.

06:00.317 --> 06:01.790
You know what? No.

06:02.097 --> 06:03.042
He'll see Jeff next.

06:03.043 --> 06:04.311
No, but you're not supposed to go...

06:04.312 --> 06:06.237
Or what? You'll do twice
as much work as a doctor

06:06.238 --> 06:07.564
for half the pay?

06:08.012 --> 06:09.034
Thank you?

06:09.172 --> 06:10.082
It's called a complisult.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.650
Part compliment, part insult.

06:11.651 --> 06:14.418
He invented them. I coined the term.

06:14.692 --> 06:16.005
See what I just did there?

06:16.006 --> 06:17.585
That was an explanabrag.

06:18.854 --> 06:19.519
Hello, Jeffrey.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.517
Pierce.

06:24.089 --> 06:25.954
I've thought about this day many times,

06:25.955 --> 06:28.563
but I've always imagined it differently.

06:28.564 --> 06:30.139
For starters, I thought
you'd be the one in bed

06:30.140 --> 06:31.951
and I'd be a hologram.

06:32.411 --> 06:33.134
What?

06:33.135 --> 06:35.774
Ah, never mind.
There's no time for that now.

06:39.727 --> 06:41.300
Pierce, it's starting to seem,

06:41.301 --> 06:42.883
from observing the others,
that you're using

06:42.884 --> 06:45.940
the social leverage afforded you
by your alleged deathbed

06:45.941 --> 06:48.627
to exact complicated acts
of psychological vengeance

06:48.628 --> 06:49.650
on those closest to you.

06:49.651 --> 06:51.159
Vengeance? Oh, no.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.270
I was never one to hold a grudge, Jeffrey.

06:53.756 --> 06:55.260
My father held grudges.

06:55.586 --> 06:57.079
I'll always hate him for that.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.637
Did you get along with your father?

06:58.638 --> 06:59.842
I got along without him.

06:59.843 --> 07:01.513
Oh, that's no good, Jeffrey.

07:01.514 --> 07:02.480
You don't want your dad to die

07:02.481 --> 07:04.111
before you tell him how you feel.

07:04.112 --> 07:04.842
I'm sure you're right.

07:04.843 --> 07:06.466
Look, let's nip this in the bud.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.099
Pierce, we're sorry we didn't respond

07:09.100 --> 07:11.149
quickly enough to your pill addiction.

07:11.150 --> 07:14.401
Is there any chance that apology is enough?

07:14.603 --> 07:17.288
Are you ready to be
bequeathed upon, Jeff?

07:17.919 --> 07:18.880
Yeah.

07:18.973 --> 07:20.105
Blow my mind.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.983
I found your father.

07:23.309 --> 07:24.359
Did you now?

07:24.412 --> 07:27.840
William Winger, born Oklahoma City, 1945.

07:28.214 --> 07:30.513
1974, married Doreen Fitzgerald.

07:30.514 --> 07:32.445
Divorced in 1983.

07:32.446 --> 07:34.341
Most recently residing in Dorchester.

07:34.342 --> 07:37.566
Currently sitting in a town car on its way

07:37.567 --> 07:39.419
to this very hospital.

07:39.487 --> 07:41.527
Should be here in an hour or so,

07:41.528 --> 07:43.020
give or take a father.

07:44.670 --> 07:45.581
That it?

07:45.582 --> 07:46.381
Yep.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.275
All right.

07:47.276 --> 07:48.730
See you at the funeral.

07:51.447 --> 07:53.992
And so it is bequeathed.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.937
What are you gonna say to your dad?

08:06.189 --> 08:08.326
I'm not gonna say anything
because I won't have to,

08:08.327 --> 08:10.303
because Pierce is playing
head games with us.

08:10.304 --> 08:11.926
I've decided not to listen to it.

08:11.927 --> 08:12.725
What?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.204
I'm not gonna listen to the CD

08:15.205 --> 08:17.353
of you guys talking about me.

08:18.933 --> 08:19.888
Because I forgive you.

08:19.889 --> 08:22.298
But how do we know
what we're being forgiven for?

08:22.299 --> 08:23.792
We don't even know what's on there.

08:23.793 --> 08:25.390
And you never have to.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.172
Hmm.

08:30.097 --> 08:31.334
But what if he is coming, though?

08:31.335 --> 08:32.900
What are you gonna say to him?

08:33.030 --> 08:35.172
Here. I'll be him. I'll be him.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.910
Hi. Hey.

08:37.912 --> 08:39.732
Hi, I'm Jeff's dad. Hi.

08:39.732 --> 08:41.101
Hi. Hi, Jeff's dad.

08:41.102 --> 08:42.063
I'm Britta's dad.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.568
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

08:43.568 --> 08:45.061
Got drunk, didn't have a condom,

08:45.062 --> 08:47.016
and her mom gets freaky
when she hears oingo boingo.

08:47.017 --> 08:48.360
Oh, God, I wish I could relate,

08:48.361 --> 08:50.516
but much like my son,
I'm a closet homosexual.

08:50.517 --> 08:51.773
Don't apologize for that.

08:51.774 --> 08:54.031
You're talking to the guy
that banged Britta's mom.

08:54.032 --> 08:55.340
I have no standards.

08:55.341 --> 08:56.622
Well, what do you say we take a tumble?

08:56.623 --> 08:57.442
I'll put on a wig.

08:57.443 --> 08:58.761
That's it. You're under arrest.

08:58.762 --> 08:59.624
I'm an undercover cop.

08:59.625 --> 09:00.954
It's not illegal to be gay.

09:00.955 --> 09:02.263
It is here in Iran.

09:02.264 --> 09:03.366
Not when we're in the green zone.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.543
That's Iraq, stupid.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.275
Well, what do I know?

09:05.276 --> 09:07.560
I'm Jeff Winger's dumb, gay dad.

09:09.845 --> 09:11.822
My father was a two-bit con man

09:11.823 --> 09:14.203
of so little substance
he couldn't leave a trail

09:14.204 --> 09:15.575
if he wanted to.

09:15.659 --> 09:17.745
And I don't care if Pierce
hired Scotland Yard.

09:17.746 --> 09:20.319
He isn't gonna track him down
from a hospital bed.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.533
I mean, money can't just
make people appear.

09:23.392 --> 09:24.389
Excuse me.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.884
I'm looking for Troy Barnes.

09:27.088 --> 09:28.676
Pierce Hawthorne sent me.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.060
Hey, Troy?

09:38.063 --> 09:39.028
Hi.

09:39.172 --> 09:40.381
I'm Levar Burton.

09:43.378 --> 09:45.989
Pierce got Levar Burton
to come here for Troy?

09:46.304 --> 09:48.453
Is there anyone he can't produce?

09:48.503 --> 09:50.124
Now I'm really getting mad.

09:50.161 --> 09:52.536
Why am I the only one
he decided to torture?

09:59.590 --> 10:02.191
I told Pierce a thousand times

10:02.192 --> 10:05.318
I never wanted to meet Levar in person!

10:05.319 --> 10:07.596
I just wanted a picture!

10:07.631 --> 10:10.324
You can't disappoint a picture!

10:10.609 --> 10:12.643
I hate you, Pierce!

10:13.816 --> 10:16.197
I hate you so much!

10:16.198 --> 10:17.773
Ahem.

10:20.936 --> 10:22.763
Annie, I forgive you.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.884
Annie Edison.

10:25.444 --> 10:27.181
Your bequeathal is at hand.

10:28.945 --> 10:30.951
Do you have a regular job here?

10:34.254 --> 10:37.108
Annie, I know you're being strong for me.

10:37.489 --> 10:39.323
I give you permission to weep.

10:40.008 --> 10:41.772
I'm crying on the inside.

10:42.293 --> 10:42.939
Gross.

10:42.940 --> 10:44.360
Well, in any case,

10:44.361 --> 10:45.742
I want to give you this.

10:45.743 --> 10:48.957
It's been in my family for six generations.

10:49.521 --> 10:50.666
Now it's yours.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.179
Thank you.

11:11.022 --> 11:12.991
Jeff, do you want to see your dad?

11:12.992 --> 11:15.125
- He's not coming.
- But do you want to see him?

11:15.126 --> 11:16.091
No.

11:16.528 --> 11:17.955
Then why aren't you leaving?

11:18.784 --> 11:20.346
Because I don't care and I'm not

11:20.347 --> 11:21.983
gonna let him think that I care.

11:22.220 --> 11:23.239
Your dad or Pierce?

11:23.240 --> 11:24.379
There is no dad.

11:24.380 --> 11:26.074
And get this thing out of my face!

11:26.518 --> 11:27.601
And don't you dare intercut this

11:27.602 --> 11:29.227
with footage of me freaking out.

11:33.960 --> 11:34.896
Oh!

11:35.268 --> 11:36.721
Is there footage of you freaking out?

11:37.421 --> 11:39.445
Abed, I'm gonna kill you

11:39.446 --> 11:40.974
and Pierce and Britta

11:40.975 --> 11:42.366
and anyone else who thinks I care

11:42.367 --> 11:43.884
about any of this!

11:44.441 --> 11:46.805
So do you go to school nearby?

11:48.932 --> 11:51.247
Well, are you more familiar with me

11:51.248 --> 11:53.507
from Star Trek or Reading Rainbow?

11:53.791 --> 11:55.368
Reading Rainbow was a show
I hosted and produced

11:55.369 --> 11:57.108
for 25 years on PBS.

11:57.713 --> 11:58.813
Ever seen it?

12:20.762 --> 12:21.939

12:22.098 --> 12:23.169
What do you mean "what does it mean"?

12:23.170 --> 12:24.199
No riddles.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.977
You're screwing around with everyone.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.029
You gave me a tiara. What does it mean?

12:28.030 --> 12:31.327
Are these... are these blood diamonds?

12:31.934 --> 12:34.312
Are they holocaust diamonds?

12:34.313 --> 12:35.144
No!

12:35.145 --> 12:36.700
Well, what does it mean?

12:37.384 --> 12:39.780
It means you're my favorite.

12:40.224 --> 12:41.838
What does that mean?

12:42.270 --> 12:43.206
I did it.

12:43.207 --> 12:44.617
I gave away the money.

12:45.975 --> 12:47.290
The red cross.

12:47.831 --> 12:49.357
You know what that makes me?

12:49.422 --> 12:50.768
A terrible person.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.545
Because if that camera wasn't on me,

12:52.546 --> 12:53.845
I would have taken that money

12:53.846 --> 12:55.544
right out of the mouths of crippled,

12:55.545 --> 12:58.568
starving, malaria-ridden refugee kids

12:58.569 --> 13:01.134
and now I know that forever.

13:01.510 --> 13:02.616
Thanks, Pierce.

13:04.547 --> 13:07.719
Britta, you've got to forgive yourself.

13:07.914 --> 13:08.455
Look at me.

13:08.456 --> 13:10.299
I've forgiven all of you
for the horrible things...

13:10.300 --> 13:12.333
Oh, for crying out loud, Shirley,
give me that CD.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.462
- Oh!
- We're gonna listen to it.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.954
I don't want to listen to it.

13:14.955 --> 13:16.666
Britta, please. Britta.

13:16.667 --> 13:17.928
Britta, wait.

13:17.929 --> 13:18.837
Britta!

13:22.673 --> 13:23.651
I'll be right back.

13:23.652 --> 13:25.650
Don't learn anything without me.

13:26.358 --> 13:29.089
So how much do we all hate Shirley?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.247
Pierce, knock it off.

13:30.248 --> 13:32.254
Hey, James Bond, stop trying to record us

13:32.255 --> 13:34.208
with that stupid spy pen.

13:34.537 --> 13:36.012
We can see the blinking light.

13:36.169 --> 13:37.438
Why do you keep trying to record us

13:37.439 --> 13:38.650
bad-mouthing each other?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.597
Because he thinks friendship
is a competition

13:40.598 --> 13:42.245
and he's always trying
to get the upper hand.

13:42.246 --> 13:44.077
Think Shirley's any different?

13:44.078 --> 13:45.600
- Yes.
- Moron.

13:45.601 --> 13:46.631
Hello!

13:47.224 --> 13:48.948
Guess we do owe you an apology, Shirley.

13:48.949 --> 13:51.129
We shouldn't have said
those things about you.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.633
I guess the lesson here is

13:58.634 --> 14:01.482
that I sometimes use guilt as a weapon.

14:02.469 --> 14:03.457
What are you doing?

14:03.486 --> 14:05.837
Oh, just shooting a talking head

14:05.838 --> 14:08.292
or did you want me to be the only one

14:08.293 --> 14:09.915
who didn't have one?

14:10.855 --> 14:11.954
No, go ahead.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.980
I think it stems from when I was...

14:20.119 --> 14:21.522
So you found my father?

14:21.783 --> 14:23.451
Yes, he's on his way.

14:23.758 --> 14:25.694
I mean, if this is too much to handle,

14:25.695 --> 14:28.214
I completely understand
and I can call it off.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.918
Actually, I think I'm ready to see him.

14:29.919 --> 14:32.388
Good. Good for you.

14:34.982 --> 14:36.993
Oh, I should probably tell you...

14:37.466 --> 14:40.117
If you're lying to me,
if my father isn't coming,

14:40.118 --> 14:42.532
if a car pulls up and
anyone other than my father

14:42.533 --> 14:45.180
steps out...
say, an actor or you in a wig...

14:45.265 --> 14:46.852
If you try to pull any Ferris Bueller,

14:46.853 --> 14:49.308
Parent Trap, Three's Company, F/X,

14:49.309 --> 14:51.256
The Deadly Art of Illusion Bull,

14:51.818 --> 14:52.936
I will beat you...

14:53.670 --> 14:56.123
And there will be nothing
madcap or wacky about it.

14:57.116 --> 14:58.104
Understood?

14:58.311 --> 14:59.305
Crystal.

15:17.043 --> 15:18.869
- I'm Levar.
- Oh, I know.

15:18.870 --> 15:20.435
I was a huge fan of Rebop.

15:20.436 --> 15:21.760
It was cancelled before I was born,

15:21.761 --> 15:24.308
but I scored some VHS copies.

15:24.889 --> 15:27.427
I was nostalgic from a very early age.

15:27.428 --> 15:28.388
Cool.

15:28.888 --> 15:31.460
Hey, you know, I assumed
that Troy was a fan,

15:31.461 --> 15:33.452
but he hasn't said a word
to me since I got here

15:33.453 --> 15:35.464
and now I've got to catch this flight.

15:35.465 --> 15:36.863
No! No! You can't go.

15:37.101 --> 15:37.602
He loves you.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.119
He talks about you all the time.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.288
How much would it cost
to change your flight till tomorrow?

15:42.289 --> 15:45.355
Is, um, $261 enough?

15:45.356 --> 15:46.631
'Cause that's all I've got.

15:46.632 --> 15:48.868
- That's all you've got?
- Yeah.

15:49.337 --> 15:51.831
No, you... you keep your money.

15:51.843 --> 15:54.464
I'll... I'll reschedule.

15:54.730 --> 15:55.459
Oh, my God. Thank you.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.161
He's gonna be so happy.

15:57.363 --> 15:59.911
You know, you are a very generous friend,

16:00.347 --> 16:02.215
but you're really stupid with your money.

16:05.716 --> 16:06.979
It's not that I'm selfish.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.679
It's just that I'm really stupid
with my money,

16:09.680 --> 16:11.950
which is why I'll never have a lot of it

16:11.951 --> 16:14.425
and because I'm a really generous friend.

16:14.646 --> 16:15.818
Problem solved.

16:15.831 --> 16:17.301
Dilemma deleted.

16:17.302 --> 16:18.923
Britta for the win!

16:21.015 --> 16:22.965
Oh, thank God he didn't take it.

16:22.966 --> 16:26.099
Could you imagine bouncing
a check to Kunta Kinte?

16:51.471 --> 16:52.345
Hello?

16:52.764 --> 16:55.104
Jeffrey, this is your father.

16:56.293 --> 16:57.345
Uh-huh?

16:57.372 --> 16:59.400
It's me here in this sedan.

17:00.084 --> 17:01.912
See? I'm waving.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.646
I'm sorry I can't come any closer, my boy.

17:05.655 --> 17:07.567
This is too difficult.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.771
You look too much like your mother.

17:10.193 --> 17:11.786
No, no. Don't come any closer.

17:11.787 --> 17:12.862
As you were.

17:13.228 --> 17:15.089
Well, have to catch a flight to Katmandu,

17:15.089 --> 17:16.992
but I just wanted to say
cherish the new friends

17:16.993 --> 17:18.037
that you've made.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.693
They're your true family now!

17:23.593 --> 17:24.444
No! Don't open it!

17:24.445 --> 17:25.910
It'll be too hard for both of us!

17:26.363 --> 17:27.480
- Oh, Jeff!
- Jeff!

17:27.481 --> 17:29.332
- Son of a...!
- Oh, no!

17:30.912 --> 17:32.084
- Oh!
- Jeff!

17:32.254 --> 17:33.338
No, no, no!

17:33.373 --> 17:35.137
When you improvise a plan,

17:35.655 --> 17:37.106
sometimes you hit a speed bump.

17:37.107 --> 17:40.183
And sometimes you hit it so hard

17:40.300 --> 17:42.464
that you soar through the air,

17:42.589 --> 17:45.169
far beyond your initial expectations.

17:45.588 --> 17:47.440
I set out to take revenge on Jeff Winger,

17:48.149 --> 17:50.498
to scare him with the ghost of his father.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.968
Instead, I took over
the role of his father,

17:54.485 --> 17:56.346
and helped make him a better man.

17:56.868 --> 17:59.342
It'll be a long time before Jeff Winger

17:59.343 --> 18:01.323
underestimates me again.

18:03.701 --> 18:04.498
Jeff, no!

18:04.499 --> 18:06.470
Why would you do something like this?

18:06.471 --> 18:08.130
Jeff! Come on, Jeff!

18:09.423 --> 18:12.379
Because I'm sick of you people

18:12.380 --> 18:14.483
not taking me seriously!

18:14.735 --> 18:16.535
You forget my birthday!

18:16.562 --> 18:19.430
You don't invite me
to your Dungeons and Dragons games

18:19.431 --> 18:21.639
or your secret trampoline!

18:22.488 --> 18:24.676
You guys think I'm some kind of a joke!

18:24.826 --> 18:27.132
This isn't disproving the theory!

18:29.519 --> 18:30.406
Good point.

18:30.407 --> 18:32.028
What'd you say? What'd you say?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.193
What did you say?

18:33.300 --> 18:36.657
Apparently I need to say
some things to my father.

18:36.981 --> 18:40.921
Things that I may have screamed
at Pierce instead.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.658
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it.

18:44.877 --> 18:46.689
But my father deserves it too.

18:48.669 --> 18:49.674
Pierce?

18:51.152 --> 18:52.605
I figured out your test.

18:52.903 --> 18:57.113
Crowns, presents, punishments, favorites.

18:57.729 --> 18:58.941
You're trying to show me the dangers

18:58.942 --> 19:00.441
of my own elitism.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.968
My constant striving to be the best.

19:03.484 --> 19:06.937
So I'm requeathing this tiara.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.303
Because if I become the kind of person

19:09.304 --> 19:11.362
who thinks it's their place
to pick favorites

19:11.363 --> 19:15.749
and torture the rest,
I'll die sad and alone.

19:16.084 --> 19:18.882
And that's what you were trying
to teach me.

19:19.653 --> 19:20.888
Very good, Annie.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.596
You pass.

19:28.492 --> 19:30.689
She's actually just my favorite.

19:35.229 --> 19:36.826
So I thought the documentary format

19:36.827 --> 19:38.351
would be like fish in a barrel,

19:38.352 --> 19:41.036
but as is the case
with a real barrel of fish,

19:41.037 --> 19:42.432
after a while, it can become cramped,

19:42.433 --> 19:43.927
chaotic, and stinky.

19:44.274 --> 19:46.031
In their floor and bats...

19:46.032 --> 19:47.926
Fortunately, if in the end,
your documentary is turning out

19:47.927 --> 19:49.621
just as messy as real life,

19:50.024 --> 19:51.305
you can always wrap it up with a series

19:51.306 --> 19:52.605
of random shots, which when cut together

19:52.606 --> 19:54.422
under a generic voice-over,

19:55.199 --> 19:57.148
suggest a profound thematic connection.

19:58.702 --> 20:00.041
I'm not knocking it.

20:00.274 --> 20:01.306
It works.

20:02.174 --> 20:03.147
Guys.

20:09.023 --> 20:09.993
Oh.

20:10.478 --> 20:11.601
Aww.

20:14.997 --> 20:16.594
Jeff and I became...

20:17.167 --> 20:19.340
Kind of like father and son today.

20:20.318 --> 20:21.690
No, we did not.

20:27.475 --> 20:28.583
Troy, I am telling you, man,

20:28.584 --> 20:30.237
this salmon is really good.

20:33.929 --> 20:35.733
Would you mind passing me the pepper?

20:41.986 --> 20:44.470
♪ Butterfly in the sky ♪

20:46.962 --> 20:49.854
♪ I can go twice as high ♪

20:50.251 --> 20:52.009

20:52.258 --> 20:53.895

20:54.448 --> 20:57.284

21:02.968 --> 21:06.110
Well, more fish for Kunta.
