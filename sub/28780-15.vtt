08:51.797 --> 08:54.200
- Today's a tattoo party.
- Yeah, right, man.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.636
Glad to help.
<i>I designed this tattoo</i>

{\an8}<i>to be difficult to do,</i>

08:57.970 --> 08:59.605
{\an8}and it's turning out
that it's even difficult

08:59.672 --> 09:01.207
{\an8}<i>for myself to do</i>
<i>in 90 minutes.</i>

09:01.274 --> 09:03.242
- Finish that outline yet?
- Almost.

09:05.978 --> 09:07.413
- Sorry I'm not talking more,

09:07.480 --> 09:09.015
'cause I don't have
enough time to talk.

09:09.081 --> 09:12.084
Jason's ink bottle is just a
lot to try to do in 90 minutes.

09:12.151 --> 09:13.552
<i>So I'm just gonna try</i>
<i>to make sure</i>

09:13.619 --> 09:15.187
<i>it's got solid blacks</i>
<i>to bold color.</i>

09:15.254 --> 09:17.590
{\an8}I'm not really gonna worry
about too many fancy tricks

09:17.657 --> 09:19.058
{\an8}because we don't have time
for that.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.427
This is one of those
I potentially might not finish.

09:22.762 --> 09:26.265

09:26.332 --> 09:29.235
Jesus. Dude, if I'm the only
one struggling right now,

09:29.302 --> 09:30.703

12:49.668 --> 12:51.837

- We're gonna judge
these things blind.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.640
Let's see how they did.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.075
{\an3}- I feel like I'm
about to [bleep] throw up.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.810
- First up is Dani's
illustrative

12:57.877 --> 12:59.145
black and gray design.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.314
Very simple. You got circles,
you got lines.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.083
- It's a sad face.
- Let's take a look

13:04.150 --> 13:05.985
at the first tattoo.
- That's mine.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.653
- There's problems
on this thing.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.755
It's not a perfect
circle at the top.

13:09.822 --> 13:11.824
The exterior line goes flat.

13:11.891 --> 13:14.393
- The soft shading
looks really nice.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.663
but the solid black areas
don't look super solid.

13:17.730 --> 13:18.864
- I'm willing to say that

13:18.931 --> 13:21.033
I don't think Dani
tattooed this.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.401
- This is technically

13:22.468 --> 13:23.869
{\an3}the most difficult
one to pull off.

13:23.936 --> 13:25.938
- Let's look at the next one.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.606
- That was mine.
- I like the way

13:27.673 --> 13:30.376
the top of the key's shaded.
- And the areas that're circles

13:30.442 --> 13:31.877
appear more circular.

13:31.944 --> 13:34.413
- But the way they leave
the pupil of the eye white,

13:34.480 --> 13:35.514
very strange.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.449
- That was an artistic
choice.

13:37.516 --> 13:38.450
- Let's move on

13:38.517 --> 13:39.885
to the third tattoo.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.153
- That's mine.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.488
- This is the best one
we've seen so far.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.523
Look at the way
the eye's shaded way better

13:44.590 --> 13:45.724
than the last one.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.126
The shading in
the top of the key--

13:47.193 --> 13:49.195
it's way smoother.
I think this is Dani's.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.597
- We'll see.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.699
- Let's move on
to the fourth one.

13:53.766 --> 13:55.768
- This perfect hollow,
round negative space

13:55.834 --> 13:57.937
all the way around
the circle of the key

13:58.003 --> 13:59.638
doesn't give any dimension.
- It's just a bunch of

13:59.705 --> 14:02.208
light gray that doesn't
get super smooth.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.275
- Ooh.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.443
- Let's look at all four

14:04.510 --> 14:05.811
{\an5}of the same tattoo together.

14:05.878 --> 14:08.547
{\an5}- Number three is the best
one, I would say.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.015
- Yeah, number three.

14:10.082 --> 14:12.585
- Now I'm ready to be
the bottom of all the rest.

14:12.651 --> 14:13.819
- If you're gonna win
any of 'em,

14:13.886 --> 14:15.154
it's best to win in your own.
- Yeah.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.655
I think so too.

14:16.722 --> 14:18.757
- Next up is Jason's
new school design.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.060
- It leaves a lot open
to see what people do.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.829
- Oh, yeah--you could tattoo
this a bunch of different ways.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.898
<i>- Let's get into the first</i>
<i>tattoo.</i>

14:25.965 --> 14:26.966
- Oh, that's mine.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.667
- I mean, good application,

14:28.734 --> 14:30.069
but if you're gonna
hit new school,

14:30.135 --> 14:31.770
you can't just have green
and light green.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.072
You gotta have
a contrasting color.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.740
- 'Cause I had plenty
of time to do that.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.243
- Let's move on to
the second tattoo.

14:37.309 --> 14:39.545
- Oh, it's mine.
- What happened to this one?

14:39.612 --> 14:40.946
This thing just looks dirty.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.414
- Why does that yellow stop

14:42.481 --> 14:43.682
and go to open skin
in the mouth

14:43.749 --> 14:44.984
when the eyes
are solid green inside?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.352
- I didn't have
enough time.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.654
- Moving along.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.456
- That one's mine.
- From a distance,

14:50.522 --> 14:52.258
the color glow looks cool,

14:52.324 --> 14:55.127
but that mouth--not clean
saturation at all.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.528
{\an3}- You think this is
a time issue?

14:56.595 --> 14:57.863
Like they spent
all their time

14:57.930 --> 14:59.231
{\an3}trying to outline
these things

14:59.298 --> 15:00.833
and then couldn't
finish the color?

15:00.899 --> 15:02.334
- Talk about dropping the
[bleep] ball

15:02.401 --> 15:04.136
on that one, Jason.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.804
- Let's look at the fourth one.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.539
Let's see if there's
a redeeming one in here.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.675
- Good luck, dude.
Here we go.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.577
{\an8}- The outline on this one
is rough

15:11.644 --> 15:13.279
{\an8}everywhere in the teeth.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.381
The mouth of this thing
got away from everybody.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.449
- That's crazy.
- Nothing connects anywhere.

15:17.516 --> 15:18.450
- Not good.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.219
- That's a lot of work to do

15:20.286 --> 15:22.221
in that amount of time.
- Sorry, everybody.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.722
- Let's take a look at all four

15:23.789 --> 15:25.658
{\an8}of these tattoos together.
- Tattoo number one's

15:25.724 --> 15:27.626
{\an8}looking better all of a sudden.
- That thing looks amazing

15:27.693 --> 15:29.094
{\an8}right now.
Two, three, and four--

15:29.161 --> 15:30.629
{\an8}To me, they're all
in the same boat.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.665
This whole round right here
are not good.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.467
- Damn, my design
[bleep] everybody up.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.469
- Let's take a look at
Laura's new school design.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.072
{\an8}- Definitely leaves some
interpretation to be done

15:40.139 --> 15:41.807
{\an8}with this line drawing,
for sure.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.809
- Let's take a look
at the first tattoo.

15:43.876 --> 15:44.810
- Oh, that's mine!

15:44.877 --> 15:46.512
{\an8}- If you look at the outlines

15:46.578 --> 15:47.846
{\an8}on the tips of the Mohawk--

15:47.913 --> 15:49.982
{\an8}look at the points,
look at the wobbly lines.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.684
{\an8}Somebody was in a hurry.

15:51.750 --> 15:52.685
- Ya [bleep] think?

15:52.751 --> 15:54.653
- Let's look at the next one.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.322
- Oh, that's mine.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.357
{\an8}- Everything has a nice
balance between the green,

15:58.424 --> 15:59.658
{\an8}the magenta, the purple.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.393
{\an8}I like the light source
on the brow,

16:01.460 --> 16:03.262
{\an8}This is a well-executed tattoo.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.997
{\an1}- Night and day
from what we just saw.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.533
<i>- Third tattoo.</i>

16:07.599 --> 16:09.468
{\an8}- There's a lot of line
discrepancies

16:09.535 --> 16:11.804
{\an8}in this big, bold outline
on the Mohawk.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.173
{\an8}There's not really a lot
of saturated black

16:14.239 --> 16:15.841
{\an8}inside the divots
or the darker areas

16:15.908 --> 16:17.509
{\an8}on the side of the skull.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.611
{\an8}The blue's not really
standing out properly.

16:19.678 --> 16:20.913
- I still like my tattoo.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.215
- Let's move on
to the fourth tattoo.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.951
- There's a lot of problems
connecting the tips

16:26.018 --> 16:28.220
of all of the points
to the Mohawk.

16:28.287 --> 16:30.723
This Mohawk detail on this
thing is killing everybody.

16:30.789 --> 16:32.524
They needed to paint the Mohawk
one solid color

16:32.591 --> 16:34.593
instead of trying to do fades
and do all this stuff

16:34.660 --> 16:37.029
that eats the clock.
- Let's look at all four

16:37.096 --> 16:38.597
{\an8}of the same tattoos.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.667
{\an8}- Number one is the bottom.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.269
{\an8}- Number two, for me,
all around is the top.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.473
- You won over my design again!

16:47.539 --> 16:50.909
- Next up is Jake's
color neotraditional design.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.544
Lucky dragon's foot, Chris?

16:52.611 --> 16:54.213
- I like the posture
of the claws.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.648
- Let's look at the first
tattoo.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.952
- Simple color palette is nice.
The line work looks smooth.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.554
Make it clean and simple--
I think that's a smart move.

17:02.621 --> 17:03.889
Overall, pretty sharp.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.391
- Let's move on
to the second tattoo.

17:05.457 --> 17:06.759
- Oh, that's mine.

17:06.825 --> 17:07.760
- I don't like this one
too much.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.461
It gets a little muddy.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.930
There's also a lotta
outline problems on this thing.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.133
- Opted to not put in
those rope lines.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.335
- It woulda helped,
because the unparallel lines

17:16.402 --> 17:18.771
stand out like a sore thumb.

17:18.837 --> 17:20.071
- Let's take a look
at the third one.

17:20.138 --> 17:21.140
- Here we go.

17:21.205 --> 17:22.775
- It's a smart color play

17:22.840 --> 17:24.742
to have a contrasting color
from the top to the bottom

17:24.810 --> 17:26.878
and then a different color
for the rope that intertwines

17:26.944 --> 17:28.180
so nothing gets lost.

17:28.247 --> 17:31.083
- It is more legible
than the one we just saw.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.018
- Let's look at the fourth one.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.454
- In that fitting where
the claw's going into,

17:35.521 --> 17:37.656
that black with that yellow
pounded over it

17:37.723 --> 17:40.092
with then that white
looks messy.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.860
That does not look clean.

17:41.927 --> 17:43.529
That isn't doing anybody
any favors here.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.964
- Jason does not
feel good right now.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.866
{\an5}- Let's compare
all four of these.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.902
{\an5}- The ones with the right color
palette look the strongest,

17:49.968 --> 17:51.770
{\an5}like number one.
- I'm gonna say

17:51.837 --> 17:54.006
{\an5}that Jake did the first one,
just because--

17:54.072 --> 17:55.340
- That's the one that
looks like the person

17:55.407 --> 17:57.142
knew what they were doing?
- Exactly.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.777
- I...don't know.

17:58.844 --> 18:00.312
- Every single critique
went different

18:00.379 --> 18:01.713
than I thought
was gonna happen.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.850
- I'm...not...
surprised...at all.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.385
I knew that those tattoos
were gonna be hard to do

18:06.452 --> 18:08.353
in that amount of time,
and I knew the tattoos I did

18:08.420 --> 18:09.521
were not great.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.290
- If everybody has a top

18:11.356 --> 18:13.725
{\an1}and everybody's got a stinker,
what happens?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.895
{\an3}- Hope I'm middle of the road,
not the [bleep] bottom.

Jake and Jason,
one of you will earn

one of you will earn

32:42.393 --> 32:44.962

32:45.029 --> 32:47.332
and one of you will pack
your machines.

32:47.398 --> 32:49.200
- For me,
there's highs and lows in both.

32:49.267 --> 32:52.136
{\an8}Jason gets a little
wavery in his outline.

32:52.203 --> 32:53.805
{\an8}If you look around the knee,
it wavers.

32:53.871 --> 32:56.341
{\an8}Also, I'm missing sculpting
in the facial features.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.277
{\an8}That outside bold line's there,
but then you get into

32:59.344 --> 33:01.679
{\an8}the eyebrow and the
lids and everything,

33:01.746 --> 33:03.614
that's why nothing's
differentiated here.

33:03.681 --> 33:07.185
More of the shortcomings for
Jake are gonna be in shading.

33:07.251 --> 33:09.620
For this to not be a debate,
the crack in the top of

33:09.687 --> 33:11.389

see how black that is?

33:11.456 --> 33:13.858
That's how black your cloak
needed to be.

33:13.925 --> 33:15.393
- Mine's obviously a witch.

33:15.460 --> 33:17.061
I can always go through and
put a little bit more black.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.063
I think with Jason's, the
eye's hard to tell what it is.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.431
Just like overall,
like especially

33:20.498 --> 33:22.633
when my shit heals,
it'll be solid and bright.

33:22.700 --> 33:24.902
{\an3}- My [bleep] tattoo
is definitely solid and bright.

33:24.969 --> 33:26.771
{\an3}My shit is drawn free
from scratch.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.639
{\an1}- But, you know,
I'm replicating a witch.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.174
It has to look like something.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.309
{\an1}His looks like
a weird gummy bear.

33:31.376 --> 33:32.710
- This is a tough choice.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.513
{\an8}Legibility on Jake's tattoo,
even the silhouette

33:35.580 --> 33:37.482
{\an8}you know is a witch,
just because all the highlights

33:37.548 --> 33:39.016
{\an8}that are in
the cheekbones stand out.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.786
But the creativity and the
drawing that Jason pulls off,

33:41.853 --> 33:44.589
I mean, I love that.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.157
- Final decision,
last spot in the finale.

Jason's creativity

33:56.267 --> 33:58.636

And Jake's tattoo,

33:58.703 --> 34:00.605
the shading that has
in the skull of this

34:00.671 --> 34:02.106

34:27.264 --> 34:29.534
and I feel like your tattooing
is gonna take off.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.668
- This was probably one of the
best experiences of my life,

34:31.735 --> 34:33.838
and I feel like I learned
a lot.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.774
- Please pack your machines
and close shop.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.112
<i>- I had my ups and downs</i>
<i>through this competition,</i>

34:41.179 --> 34:42.547
<i>but I feel like</i>
<i>I turned it around</i>

34:42.612 --> 34:45.349
and proved something to myself
and everybody here.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.150
<i>You know, I might not have</i>
<i>made a top three,</i>

34:47.217 --> 34:48.820
<i>but I'm not stuck in my ways,</i>

34:48.886 --> 34:50.755
and I still remember the shit
that my dad taught me.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.824
<i>If anything, it's gonna</i>
<i>make me a better artist,</i>

34:52.889 --> 34:54.926
and I couldn't be happier.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.299
- Whoo!
- We [bleep] did it!

35:01.365 --> 35:04.068
{\an1}Oh, my God.
Ooh, yes!

35:04.135 --> 35:06.337
- Going to the finale!
Ah!

35:07.805 --> 35:09.240
{\an1}- I know, different teams,
but it doesn't matter,

35:09.307 --> 35:11.976
'cause we're all here!
- This is nuts.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.744
{\an3}- That worked out
just the way I planned.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.079
{\an3}Excellent.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.682
- I cannot wait
to tattoo against you guys.

35:17.748 --> 35:18.850
- Let's [bleep] do this.

35:18.916 --> 35:21.586
- Yes, yes!

35:21.652 --> 35:25.523
<i>[epic music]</i>

35:25.590 --> 35:32.163
<i>♪ ♪</i>

35:32.230 --> 35:33.531
- Welcome.

35:33.598 --> 35:35.199
Throughout the competition,

35:35.266 --> 35:38.135
you had to wage war
against the opposite sex.

35:39.237 --> 35:42.306
{\an8}And the three of you
are the last artists standing.

35:42.373 --> 35:45.042
However, man or woman,
only one of you

35:45.109 --> 35:48.412
will earn $100,000,
a feature in "Inked" magazine,

35:48.479 --> 35:50.882
and the title of Ink Master.

35:52.016 --> 35:53.551
For your final tattoo,

35:53.618 --> 35:55.753
each of you will be
assigned a master canvas,

35:55.820 --> 35:59.891
and have a total of 35 hours
over the next several months

35:59.957 --> 36:03.628
to tattoo a back piece.

36:03.694 --> 36:05.897
- Dope.
- Yeah, okay.

36:05.963 --> 36:07.865
This will be
the biggest tattoo

36:07.932 --> 36:10.368
I've ever done and completed
in this amount of time.

36:10.434 --> 36:13.905
- The subject of your back
piece is completely up to you.

36:13.971 --> 36:16.140
- Okay.
- Ooh.

36:16.207 --> 36:18.109
- But the style is not.

36:18.175 --> 36:20.177
- Oh.
- Interesting.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.446
- The style of your
back piece will be determined

36:22.513 --> 36:23.447
by your opponents.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.484
- No way.
- Oh, snap.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.953
Team opponent,
group opponents?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.222
- Laura and Creepy Jason,
you'll choose the style

36:31.289 --> 36:32.390
for Dani.

36:32.456 --> 36:35.026
- Oh,
I see what's going on here.

36:35.092 --> 36:37.328
- Dani and Creepy Jason,
you'll choose the style

36:37.395 --> 36:39.230
for Laura.
And finally,

36:39.297 --> 36:41.465
Dani and Laura,
you'll choose the style

36:41.532 --> 36:42.967
for Creepy Jason.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.171
- At this point,
Dani and Laura have spent

36:47.238 --> 36:49.307
<i>so long in a team together</i>

36:49.373 --> 36:51.909
that it feels like it's gonna
be two against one.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.411
- Everybody here
is your competitor.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.546
You need to assign a style
to the other artist

36:55.613 --> 36:57.481
that is something that
is gonna challenge them.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.917
I would make them prove beyond
a shadow of a doubt

36:59.984 --> 37:01.352
they deserve to win
this [bleep] thing.

37:02.420 --> 37:04.822
- Mm-hmm.
- Laura and Creepy Jason,

37:04.889 --> 37:09.026
take a minute to discuss what
style you want to assign Dani.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.928
- Let's go.
- Okay.

37:10.995 --> 37:12.496
<i>I've been friendly</i>
<i>with Jason and Dani</i>

37:12.563 --> 37:13.864
<i>this entire competition,</i>
<i>but at this point,</i>

37:13.931 --> 37:15.866
it's every artist
for themselves.

37:15.933 --> 37:17.635
{\an1}If you want to play it evil,
I'll play it evil.

37:17.702 --> 37:20.137
{\an3}- We need to hit
her with something color.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.639
{\an3}She's also really
[bleep] slow,

37:21.706 --> 37:23.641
{\an3}and that's something that
we can capitalize on.

37:23.708 --> 37:24.742
{\an1}- Biomech.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.447
- That's [bleep] brilliant.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.549
- Okay.
- Done.

37:31.616 --> 37:33.651
<i>- Because Laura and Jason</i>
<i>have been really tight,</i>

37:33.718 --> 37:35.753
<i>I imagine I'm gonna</i>
<i>get a tough tattoo.</i>

37:35.820 --> 37:37.655
As long as it's not Japanese,
I'm okay.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.359
- Dani, Creepy Jason,

37:41.425 --> 37:42.793
take a minute and discuss
what style.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.695
you want to assign Laura.

37:45.863 --> 37:48.032
- All right.
I don't think anything

37:48.099 --> 37:49.333
{\an1}we give her is
going to stump her.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.168
{\an3}- I agree.
I couldn't agree more.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.371
Japanese?
- Like a straight traditional

37:53.437 --> 37:54.939
Japanese.
- Straight up traditional,

37:55.006 --> 37:56.474
{\an3}that definitely has a lot
more rules to it

37:56.540 --> 37:58.075
than really [bleep] any other.

37:58.142 --> 38:00.044
- I know that Jason and Dani
are gonna throw me

38:00.111 --> 38:01.812
some kind of
crazy-ass curve ball,

38:01.879 --> 38:03.214
<i>but I am ready.</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:05.449
<i>Give me neotraditional,</i>
<i>give me trash polka,</i>

38:05.516 --> 38:07.852
give me realism.
I've [bleep] got you.

38:07.918 --> 38:10.187
- Dani and Laura,
take a minute and discuss

38:10.254 --> 38:12.990
what style you want
to assign Creepy Jason.

38:14.625 --> 38:18.095
{\an1}- We're definitely
doing black and gray realism,

38:18.162 --> 38:21.932
{\an1}okay? Because that's
like technical for days.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.601
- I have no complaints.
- You have no complaints?

38:23.668 --> 38:25.102
- No.
- Awesome.

38:25.169 --> 38:26.237
All right.

38:27.605 --> 38:30.374
- Okay.
What style must Dani tattoo?

38:33.110 --> 38:35.446
- Color biomech.

38:35.513 --> 38:37.448
- Wow!
- Sweet.

38:37.515 --> 38:39.083
- That is a challenge.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.319
- I was hoping for something
that I've literally never done,

38:42.386 --> 38:43.788
so let's do it.

38:43.854 --> 38:48.693
- Dani, Creepy Jason,
what style must Laura tattoo?

38:48.759 --> 38:50.895
- Traditional color Japanese.

38:50.961 --> 38:52.296
<i>- Are you guys serious?</i>

38:52.363 --> 38:53.731
You're seriously
gonna give me

38:53.798 --> 38:56.300
something that you've seen me
draw from day one?

38:56.367 --> 38:57.635
I actually
feel pretty good about it.

38:57.702 --> 38:59.103
- We figured you would.
- Well, we figured

38:59.170 --> 39:00.271
{\an1}we're just gonna
give you something

39:00.337 --> 39:01.706
{\an1}that's got a lot of
rules to it

39:01.772 --> 39:02.873
{\an1}and see if you can follow
all of 'em.

39:02.940 --> 39:04.308
- I'm ready.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.576
- And finally,
Dani and Laura,

39:05.643 --> 39:09.447
what style
must Creepy Jason tattoo?

39:09.513 --> 39:10.648
- Realistic black and gray.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.217
- Oh, I can live with that.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.952
That's not so bad.
- Go ahead, live with it.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.554
- Why did you choose
that style for Jason?

39:16.620 --> 39:18.522
- Oh, just take away everything
he loves doing in a tattoo,

39:18.589 --> 39:19.924
pretty much.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.993
- And that is it.
The finale is set.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.463
Your master canvases
are completely open.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.498
Your first session will be
in your hometown

39:27.565 --> 39:28.799
in just a few weeks.

39:28.866 --> 39:33.270
This tattoo alone stands
between you and $100,000.

39:36.240 --> 39:40.111
- The time has come
to end the battle of the sexes.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.679
Safe travels,
and we'll see you

39:41.746 --> 39:44.148
at the finale in Las Vegas.
Good luck.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.516
- All right.

39:48.018 --> 39:50.154
<i>I came here as</i>
<i>an underdog my entire life,</i>

39:50.221 --> 39:52.656
and I came here to prove
to everyone else

39:52.723 --> 39:55.359
<i>that I can do</i>
<i>what I set out to do.</i>

39:55.426 --> 39:56.727
It's [bleep] done, son.

39:58.329 --> 40:00.197
- There is no doubt that
I was underestimated

40:00.264 --> 40:01.866
throughout
this whole entire thing.

40:01.932 --> 40:03.501
<i>And I have proven</i>
<i>that I can do anything</i>

40:03.567 --> 40:05.102
<i>that's thrown at me.</i>

40:05.169 --> 40:07.638
I just know that I'm gonna work
as hard as humanly possible

40:07.705 --> 40:10.141
and make this thing
look so frickin' cool

40:10.207 --> 40:12.109
<i>that I'm gonna blow myself</i>
<i>out of the water.</i>

40:12.176 --> 40:13.511
- Okay.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.646
<i>The only way that</i>
<i>I am going to beat</i>

40:15.713 --> 40:19.884
these other two artists
is strictly just my creativity.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.787
<i>I'm going to put everything</i>
<i>I have into this tattoo.</i>

40:22.853 --> 40:26.357
I have to make sure that the
next Ink Master is a woman.

40:26.423 --> 40:28.759
- Oh, shit.
- All right, girls.

40:28.826 --> 40:31.395
ready to [bleep] go?
- [laughs] I'm ready.

40:31.462 --> 40:33.297
- Oh, you have no idea.
- We're going to Vegas,

40:33.364 --> 40:34.832
and if I was you,
I'd put money on me,

40:34.899 --> 40:36.066
Because I'm taking it home.
- Okay.

40:36.133 --> 40:37.668
May the best woman win.
Sorry, Jason.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.804
- Creep it real!

40:56.654 --> 40:57.688

41:02.059 --> 41:03.027
I don't think they have
a chance.

41:03.093 --> 41:04.395
- Can't go back now.

41:04.461 --> 41:05.696
I made it to this point,

41:05.763 --> 41:07.097
<i>so clearly I was doing</i>
