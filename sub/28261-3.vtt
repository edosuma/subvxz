00:00.534 --> 00:02.903
(female narrator)
Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars, The Perfectionists.."

00:02.903 --> 00:05.706
Nolan Hotchkiss,
what do you think of the book?

00:05.706 --> 00:07.641
Characters got
what they deserved.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.776
Oh, Dylan,
same arrangement as last year

00:09.776 --> 00:11.645
you'll do the papers
for Ava and me.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.513
Uh, I can..

00:13.513 --> 00:15.716
I can cover yours
but I can't do Ava's work.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.719
You are the smartest guy
I know.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.787
Figure it out.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.656
(Dylan)
Until they find out who
really killed Nolan

00:22.656 --> 00:24.491
everybody at BHU's a suspect.

00:24.491 --> 00:25.826
(Caitlin)
And even though we didn't
do it, we all have

00:25.826 --> 00:27.728
secrets that make us
look guilty.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.596
If there was someone
here with us that night..

00:29.596 --> 00:30.898
(Dylan)
They heard us
talking about him.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.599
About how we wished he was dead.

00:32.599 --> 00:34.735
And they killed him
just like we imagined it.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.905
Turns out there was partial
Beacon Guard blackout

00:37.905 --> 00:39.973
about the time
of Nolan's murder.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.042
Anyone who says they were
at your house that night

00:42.042 --> 00:43.777
is safe for now.

00:43.777 --> 00:44.978
I never thanked you guys
for staying late

00:44.978 --> 00:46.647
at my house last Thursday.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.248
They were with you
the night of the murder.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.717
(Alison)
'I mean, you can ask
the three of them.'

00:50.717 --> 00:52.619
I can talk for hours.

00:52.619 --> 00:54.988
[instrumental music]

00:54.988 --> 00:56.757
Bring it on, bitch.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.427
[instrumental music]

01:03.096 --> 01:06.533
(Dylan)
'Is it cool to do that?'

01:06.533 --> 01:09.469
Not according to the emails that
the university keeps sending me.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.605
But that's not your problem.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.808
So we drank coffee
and we ate pie.

01:16.543 --> 01:18.946
Pie's a little too specific,
uh, stick with coffee.

01:18.946 --> 01:21.548
- Ms. DiLaurentis..
- Alison.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.083
You all call me Alison.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.718
I'm a TA, not a professor.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.720
Little bit of informality
will help.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.156
[clears throat]
Ms. Di.. Alison.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.091
Why did you say we were
here with you

01:31.091 --> 01:32.626
that night Nolan
was killed?

01:32.626 --> 01:34.561
Why did you lie for us?

01:34.561 --> 01:36.630
The Beacon Guard cameras
in this area were down

01:36.630 --> 01:37.864
when Nolan was killed.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.866
So for now,
this is a solid alibi.

01:39.866 --> 01:43.003
Well, that's the answer to
how we might get away with it.

01:43.003 --> 01:45.138
It's not why you did it.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.908
Because I have terrible
impulse control.

01:47.908 --> 01:50.877
And authority figures who are
prone to abusing the system

01:50.877 --> 01:52.212
are a trigger for me.

01:52.212 --> 01:54.781
Well, that's Dana Booker
for sure.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.218
Just so that this doesn't
all blow up in our faces..

01:58.218 --> 02:01.421
...where were you really
when Nolan was killed?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.624
Walking home.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.594
- Yeah. Me too.
- Yeah.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.130
So, you didn't do anything?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.467
No one saw you, that could prove
that this was a lie.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.434
No.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.005
[sighs]

02:19.506 --> 02:20.474
Okay.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.243
Got any questions?

02:23.243 --> 02:26.246
- So what do you want us to do?
- Nothing.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.016
I want you to act like
nothing is out of the ordinary.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.717
I don't know if I can
do that.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.186
Oh, I think you can do anything
you set your mind to.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.654
And when the stakes
are this high

02:34.654 --> 02:36.189
you have to stick together.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.125
And what are you gonna do?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.162
Nothing I haven't done before.

02:45.599 --> 02:49.036
This was recorded 12 minutes
before Nolan's murder.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.537
As you can see,
they're gathered

02:50.537 --> 02:52.005
together at Thorn Hall.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.807
Well, it doesn't prove
that they did it.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.877
Is it proof? No. But they look
and are acting suspicious.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.046
Why would they want
my son dead?

02:59.046 --> 03:01.214
You know Nolan wasn't perfect,
right?

03:01.214 --> 03:04.551
He had a way of getting
them to do what he wanted

03:04.551 --> 03:06.153
and it wasn't always pretty.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.689
Well, it wasn't, Caitlin.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.126
With all due respect,
Mrs. Hotchkiss

03:13.126 --> 03:15.695
she lied about
where they were that night.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.030
She said she was
with the others

03:17.030 --> 03:19.599
at Alison DiLaurentis' house.
She wasn't.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.102
Well, is it possible they went
there after they separated

03:22.102 --> 03:25.238
and they were at Alison's
when Nolan was killed?

03:25.238 --> 03:28.241
It's possible but
I know a liar when I see one.

03:28.241 --> 03:29.876
And they're all covering
for each other.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.179
Well, you better find out why.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.783
'Use what you have
to get them to talk.'

03:36.783 --> 03:39.119
And when Caitlin
comes to me for help

03:39.119 --> 03:41.154
I'll be the person
that she turns to

03:41.154 --> 03:43.657
the person that she trusts.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.793
You really think
she'll tell you the truth?

03:46.793 --> 03:48.762
Well, she's not gonna risk
her family's future

03:48.762 --> 03:51.465
to protect Dylan or Ava.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.868
It's not in her DNA.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.673
♪ If I show you
then I know you ♪

03:59.673 --> 04:02.209
♪ Won't tell what I said ♪

04:02.209 --> 04:05.545
♪ 'Cause two can keep a secret ♪

04:05.545 --> 04:08.448
♪ If one of them is dead ♪♪

04:10.684 --> 04:13.987
(Ava)
How do you act normal when
nothing in your life is normal?

04:13.987 --> 04:16.022
When you're forced to trust
people you hardly know

04:16.022 --> 04:17.991
and just hope they
don't let you down

04:17.991 --> 04:19.860
because if they do

04:19.860 --> 04:22.863
everything you've ever
worked for falls apart.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.631
Hey, she threw us a lifeline
when she didn't have to.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.567
- I think we should trust her.
- Forget Alison.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.836
We barely know each other.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.706
I mean, how do we know
we can trust us?

04:32.706 --> 04:36.843
It's not like Nolan's death
made us instant best friends.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.579
Hey, do you guys just
want to sit for a second?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.716
I've got a few minutes.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.717
Okay.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.987
So how're you two holdin' up?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.788
- It sucks.
- Yeah.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.257
It's, like, there's
so much going on

04:50.257 --> 04:53.927
I need to make a list
to prioritize my anxiety.

04:53.927 --> 04:57.731
Well, is priority number one
on your list Nolan's stash?

04:57.731 --> 04:58.999
Because that's number one
on mine.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.068
Yeah, if what he was
holding over me gets out

05:02.068 --> 05:04.704
it doesn't just ruin me,
it ruins my entire family.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.674
Guys, our secrets
are out there..

05:07.674 --> 05:10.744
- And they make us look guilty.
- What do we do?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.181
Till we figure out who has them

05:14.181 --> 05:15.982
just get back to business
as usual.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.617
Speaking of which,
you guys are meeting me

05:17.617 --> 05:18.785
at the student union
at 3:00, right?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.720
To kick off
the care package drive?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.724
Number two on my list of things
to worry about today

05:24.724 --> 05:27.527
getting 1500 care packages
out to service people

05:27.527 --> 05:29.162
for a volunteer day.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.998
You guys both agreed
to help me.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.934
Yeah, because
no one forced me to.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.669
Yeah, I kind of assumed
those drills were off now.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.137
No, no, no,
if I don't get these boxes

05:37.137 --> 05:38.805
out tonight,
they won't make it to the ship.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.540
I'm sorry,
I have my Vogue application

05:40.540 --> 05:42.142
video that's due and..

05:42.142 --> 05:43.677
Ugh!

05:43.677 --> 05:44.744
What time is it?

05:44.744 --> 05:46.880
This is so personal for me.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.749
My mom's retired military.

05:49.749 --> 05:51.751
I'm sorry, alright, I got the

05:51.751 --> 05:55.889
art history paper
in designing to start and..

05:55.889 --> 05:59.492
[sighs]
I have something more important
than school to do too.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.161
Like what?

06:01.161 --> 06:05.432
Andrew's out of town for
the week, he's in Seattle, and..

06:05.432 --> 06:06.566
...our anniversary is coming up

06:06.566 --> 06:08.735
so I'm composing a piece
for him.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.705
That's very sweet,
but are we still supposed

06:11.705 --> 06:13.974
to be Nolan's perfect posse?

06:13.974 --> 06:17.711
[sighs]
Caitlin, one pass.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.713
Alright, plus,
we gotta get to class.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.181
- You're kidding.
- Well..

06:21.181 --> 06:23.450
I wish you would've
reminded us.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.886
- Ava!
- I'm sorry.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.854
I just can't squeeze it in.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.661
What the hell are you
talking about, Ali? God!

06:34.661 --> 06:38.131
I said that alibi was good
for you, not half your class.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.633
Didn't we decide
you were gonna drop the whole

06:39.633 --> 06:41.134
role model routine
and go back to being

06:41.134 --> 06:42.435
the old Ali
that we know and love?

06:42.435 --> 06:44.638
What? Lying,
conniving, duplicitous..

06:44.638 --> 06:47.107
Your words, not mine.

06:47.107 --> 06:50.243
I told you. I'm trying to do
what's right for these guys.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.679
I need your help, Mona.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.514
[sighs]

06:54.514 --> 06:57.017
Alright, what do you
need from me?

06:57.017 --> 06:59.719
I have to imagine that
Dana Booker is doing a deep dive

06:59.719 --> 07:01.321
on Ava, Caitlin and Dylan,
and me too.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.490
Why not? I mean,
she's got all of Beacon Guard

07:03.490 --> 07:05.091
at her fingertips.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.926
Well, I was hoping
that you have some tricks

07:06.926 --> 07:08.495
so that we can see
what she's up to.

07:08.495 --> 07:11.197
Under normal circumstances,
good idea.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.932
Today? No can do.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.401
I'm locked out of BHU's network.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.469
All of my records and my code..

07:16.469 --> 07:19.939
- Everything's been walled off.
- What? Why?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.208
Suspicious activity
on my account.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.378
'They must know I've been trying
to figure out who killed Nolan.'

07:25.378 --> 07:28.081
But we need to do
our own suspicious activity.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.416
Well, right now,
there's only one database

07:29.416 --> 07:31.351
I still have access to.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.621
[mellow music]

07:36.222 --> 07:37.490
BHU's yearbook?

07:37.490 --> 07:39.092
Dana Booker's gonna throw

07:39.092 --> 07:41.094
all of Beacon Guard
that she's got at this.

07:41.094 --> 07:44.397
And she's gonna find out that
you lied for your Ali buddies.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.366
The only question is when.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.640
Good morning.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.243
I know this isn't
an easy time for any of us

07:57.243 --> 08:00.180
to return to classwork,
but it could also be

08:00.180 --> 08:02.082
the best thing for all of us.

08:07.253 --> 08:10.256
Get out of his seat.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.526
- W-what're you talking about?
- Get out of his seat.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.062
The-the seat is up
for grabs now, right?

08:16.062 --> 08:17.263
- I mean..
- Mason.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.399
Get out of his seat, Mason!

08:19.399 --> 08:21.201
[indistinct chatter]

08:21.201 --> 08:23.103
Calm down. Calm down.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.206
Excuse me.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.110
[door closes]

08:31.077 --> 08:34.013
[indistinct chatter]

08:39.986 --> 08:41.521
Let's get started.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.258
[intense music]

08:49.529 --> 08:50.530
Ava.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.734
Ava.

08:54.734 --> 08:58.004
Shouldn't you be in class?
Is something wrong?

08:59.572 --> 09:01.541
N-no, I just, uh,
I forgot a book.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.543
Well, you might be checking
on your friend Ava

09:03.543 --> 09:06.679
she seems upset
about something.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.148
There are a lot of people here

09:08.148 --> 09:10.216
who could have had issues
with Nolan, okay?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.252
So why are you
so focused on us?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.954
'Cause I've been watching you,
and thanks to Beacon Guard

09:14.954 --> 09:17.157
I can see all the way back
to when you first came to BHU.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.691
You know
what's interesting?

09:18.691 --> 09:21.161
You three never spent
any time together

09:21.161 --> 09:23.363
unless you were
around Nolan.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.098
[scoffs]
Alright.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.399
I gotta go to class.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.501
Was he holding
something on you?

09:29.502 --> 09:31.304
No.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.373
Are you sure?

09:33.373 --> 09:38.044
Because something that would
destroy your family got out.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.454
Nothing stays secret forever.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.396
What is this?

09:56.396 --> 09:58.331
It looks like your mom,
the senator

09:58.331 --> 10:00.700
and an unidentified male
doing something your other--

10:00.700 --> 10:03.169
I know. I know. I know
what it is. I've seen it before.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.271
I'm asking you
why you're showing it to me.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.706
I thought it was
worth discussing.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.609
Well, it's not.
Where did you get it?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.678
Off your boyfriend,
Nolan's phone.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.413
Is he the one
who showed it to you?

10:13.413 --> 10:16.749
I mean, we both knew it was fake
and he wanted to warn me.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.718
Some people will believe
anything they see.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.620
That's what interests me,
the fact that some people

10:20.620 --> 10:24.157
would believe this
is what makes it dangerous.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.492
'If Nolan showed it to you'

10:25.492 --> 10:28.094
how many other people
did he show it to?

10:28.094 --> 10:29.429
Nolan wouldn't.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.367
I imagine you'd be
willing to do anything

10:34.367 --> 10:36.569
to make sure that was true.

10:36.569 --> 10:40.473
You know where I was that night,
so stop harassing me.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.077
Now, I really have to go.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.581
[intense music]

10:53.453 --> 10:55.588
I know why you asked to see me.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.490
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.996
Do you think that I should,
uh, report Ava's behavior?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.265
Now, I-I don't wanna
get her into trouble.

11:05.265 --> 11:08.902
But, uh, she seemed a little
aggressive, don't you think?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.540
While I know that Ava's actions
have no place in the classroom

11:13.540 --> 11:16.409
I think you sitting in Nolan's
seat was a little insensitive.

11:16.409 --> 11:19.178
Well, that's exactly
what he would've done.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.551
You and Nolan were friends?

11:24.551 --> 11:26.419
Seemed like you did
everything together.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.756
Sports, classes, clubs..

11:29.756 --> 11:34.160
He was always number one,
and you were right behind him.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.729
Guess you'd called it
a good-natured rivalry.

11:36.729 --> 11:39.766
- You're happy with that?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

11:39.766 --> 11:42.735
Membership in, uh, Nolan's
circle came with benefits.

11:42.735 --> 11:45.572
Parties were great.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.641
- And then what happened?
- He came here.

11:48.641 --> 11:52.078
- So thing's changed.
- He changed.

11:52.078 --> 11:54.447
I guess having your name
on half the buildings on campus

11:54.447 --> 11:57.183
will do that to you.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.085
You know, pretty soon
all those benefits..

11:59.085 --> 12:01.387
Well, he took 'em away.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.156
Along with Caitlin.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.424
He took her too.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.062
So today in class...was what?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.565
Tryin' to get back at him?

12:12.565 --> 12:15.068
I told you, it's what
Nolan would've expected.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.738
Hell, it's what he would
want me to do.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.239
And that's not a secret.

And you're wearing my coat.

Which is something I've seen you
do a lot of before this week.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.274
Oh, wow. How did that happen?

Didn't your dad
give this to you?

If you're being serious,
you must be wasted.

Well, I won't tell him
if you won't.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.230
Isn't it like sorority rush
or something tonight?

14:24.230 --> 14:26.966
BHU doesn't have sororities.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.368
And it's volunteer day,
remember?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.436
Great.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.238
So go do that.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.040
And leave me alone.

Oh, um, I was gonna
call you because

16:50.109 --> 16:52.278
I was looking through
Nolan's room

from Nolan's phone.

she's looking into three people

of Nolan's murder.

to do with it.

Yeah, I think so.

Did he have something on them?

you have to ask Dylan and Ava.

No, I..

18:24.203 --> 18:26.105
I want you to find out.

and that probably ended

19:10.182 --> 19:12.184

dating his girlfriend.

- Plus he's model cute. Why?
- Just following a hunch.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.057
He was all weepy at the funeral

19:18.057 --> 19:20.459
and Nolan 2.0 in class today.

19:20.459 --> 19:22.228

something up.

- Nope.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.201

19:29.201 --> 19:32.605
that the suspicious activity
came from a single source.

find out who killed Nolan.

on the right track, right?

It does, which is good
because if I don't find out

19:42.682 --> 19:44.517
I'm gonna spend the
rest of my life knowing that

19:44.517 --> 19:46.385
I'm the one
who got him killed.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.120
None of us
got him killed, Mona.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.557
Maybe. But whoever did this
is smart, Ali.

on anyone they want.

36:50.608 --> 36:53.511
I'm just glad that...we're not
alone, right?

36:53.511 --> 36:55.880
That we're in this together.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.616
Yeah, I mean,
are we together?

36:58.616 --> 37:00.518
We did make
a good team out there.

37:04.355 --> 37:09.327
Well, I've got my Vogue
application video to..

37:09.327 --> 37:11.696
suck less on.. So..

37:11.696 --> 37:14.432
Yeah, I've got my congressional
interview to prep for

37:14.432 --> 37:16.701
and moms have been
bugging me for days.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.603
I've got everything.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.706
So, goodnight.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.441
Okay.

37:25.777 --> 37:28.446
- Guys?
- Yeah?

37:28.446 --> 37:31.883
Can I borrow you for, like,
ten minutes?

37:36.721 --> 37:39.657
[violin music]

38:06.684 --> 38:09.621
[music continues]

38:14.692 --> 38:16.694
Let's get something straight..

38:16.694 --> 38:18.863
[violin music]

38:18.863 --> 38:22.834
I am not a perfect choice
for the Vogue internship.

38:25.570 --> 38:29.908
Actually, I'm not a perfect
choice for anything, really

38:29.908 --> 38:32.777
but...that's kinda my point.

38:35.613 --> 38:40.385
Spending your whole life
chasing perfection

38:40.385 --> 38:43.354
and surrounded by people
with that same

38:43.354 --> 38:45.890
impossible goal..

38:45.890 --> 38:47.892
...it makes it seem as if

38:47.892 --> 38:51.029
every setback is a defeat.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.797
And every roadblock is a sign

38:52.797 --> 38:56.534
that you've chosen
the wrong path..

38:56.534 --> 38:57.669
...that you're inadequate..

38:59.804 --> 39:00.772
...a failure.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.877
But sometimes we overcome

39:05.877 --> 39:08.346
and we realize that
we're not alone

39:08.346 --> 39:10.415
that you can rely on others
to lift you up

39:10.415 --> 39:12.483
and that it's okay
to ask for help

39:12.483 --> 39:15.320
because even in our darkest
moments of grief

39:15.320 --> 39:19.691
and loss, we persevere,
and we make connections.

39:21.326 --> 39:24.429
Look, I'm a work in progress.

39:24.429 --> 39:26.698
But I'm realizing
that success isn't about

39:26.698 --> 39:28.700
never making mistakes

39:28.700 --> 39:30.868
it's about learning
from your mistakes.

39:30.868 --> 39:31.836
So, no..

39:33.705 --> 39:35.807
I am not a perfect choice
for anything

39:35.807 --> 39:37.675
but I am the right choice
for this

39:37.675 --> 39:40.612
because my mission statement
is in line with yours..

39:40.612 --> 39:42.247
To lead and inspire.

39:43.414 --> 39:44.882
Ali?

39:44.882 --> 39:45.817
Come in.

39:48.620 --> 39:49.554
[door closes]

39:51.389 --> 39:53.024
Do you know why
I faked my own death?

39:53.024 --> 39:55.393
Because everyone in Rosewood
wanted to kill you?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.494
Not everyone.

39:57.762 --> 39:58.897
But that's not the point.

39:59.964 --> 40:02.400
This campus, this town..

40:02.400 --> 40:03.568
Something's wrong here.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.771
Something worse than
we've been thinking.

40:06.771 --> 40:07.572
What?

40:10.041 --> 40:12.243
I think Taylor Hotchkiss
might be alive.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.546
[sighs]

40:17.382 --> 40:20.385
[indistinct chattering]

40:20.385 --> 40:23.588
- At the end of the day..
- Hey.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.323
You want us to walk you home?

40:25.323 --> 40:27.659
I mean, there's a killer
on the loose after all.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.594
Ugh. No, I'm-I'm good.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.928
Alright, suit yourself.

40:33.831 --> 40:36.801
[instrumental music]

40:54.419 --> 40:57.355
[indistinct chatter]

41:00.725 --> 41:01.626
[phone beeps]

41:07.498 --> 41:10.968
Hey, I think I know who was
in the woods that night.

41:13.538 --> 41:14.772
It was Mason.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.446
[instrumental music]
