WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.072
I CAN'T STAND
LIVING WITH GINA ANYMORE.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.739
SHE IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.242
LAST NIGHT, SHE CAME HOME
DRUNK WITH A GUY,

00:08.242 --> 00:11.212
AND THEY STARTED
GETTING BUSY ON THE COUCH.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.582
SHE KEPT YOU UP?

00:14.582 --> 00:16.450
NO.

00:16.450 --> 00:19.187
I WAS DOING THE SAME THING.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.590
IT JUST, YOU KNOW,

00:22.590 --> 00:27.061
IT TURNED INTO THIS
FREAKY KIND OF COMPETITION.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.929
YOU KNOW,
THE POLICE FOUND TWO BODIES

00:28.929 --> 00:31.299
BY THE RAIL YARD THIS MORNING.

00:31.299 --> 00:33.567
SAID THE MEN PULLED OUT
THEIR OWN EYES.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.370
YOU DIDN'T TURN ON THE LIGHTS,
DID YOU?

00:36.370 --> 00:41.242
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS
I NEED MY OWN APARTMENT.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.910
GO GET ONE.
YOU GOT MONEY SAVED.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.512
YEAH, BUT I DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH YET.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.081
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE THROWING ME
A PARTY AT THE FACTORY

00:47.081 --> 00:48.916
FOR WORKING THERE 40 YEARS.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.985
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST CANCEL IT
AND GIVE ME THE CASH?

00:51.985 --> 00:54.188
OKAY.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.592
HERE YOU GO, SIR.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.697
I WORK LIKE A DOG
MY WHOLE LIFE,

01:03.697 --> 01:06.534
AND ALL YOU'RE GONNA GIVE ME
IS A $40 PARTY?

01:06.534 --> 01:09.570
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
GIVE ME $20 BACK.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.607
I'LL JUST TAKE MY GIFT
AND GO.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.277
WHOA, WHOA, HANDS OFF, BAT.
THAT'S ANGIE'S BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.911
AND YOU DON'T NEED
A CASHMERE SWEATER.

01:17.911 --> 01:22.450
NATURE ALREADY GAVE YOU
A FURRY COAT AND MATCHING PANTS.

01:22.450 --> 01:27.020
HEY, WHY ARE YOU
GIVING ANGIE HER PRESENT NOW?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.989
HER BIRTHDAY'S
NOT TILL NEXT WEEK.

01:28.989 --> 01:32.260
WHAT? TODAY'S HER BIRTHDAY.
YOU'RE MESSING WITH ME.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.094
I'M JUST TRYING TO
HELP YOU OUT.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.230
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S YOUR CALL.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.168
MAN, IF I DON'T
GET THIS RIGHT,

01:40.168 --> 01:42.936
I'M GONNA GET THE STINKFACE
FOR A WEEK.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.838
YOU BETTER THINK FAST.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.607
HIDE THIS.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.778
MORNING, HONEY.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.446
MORNING, BABY.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I AM GONNA

01:54.448 --> 01:56.717
TAKE YOU SOMEPLACE VERY SPECIAL
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY...

01:56.717 --> 01:58.186
NEXT WEEK.

01:58.186 --> 02:01.655
MY BIRTHDAY IS TODAY.

02:03.824 --> 02:06.194
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ANGIE.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.833
ANGIE, THAT'S MY GIFT!
I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE YOU THAT!

02:12.833 --> 02:14.202
YEAH, RIGHT.

02:14.202 --> 02:17.571
ANGIE, SHE STOLE MY GIFT!

02:17.571 --> 02:20.974
DON'T GIVE ME THE STINKFACE!
SHE DESERVES THE STINKFACE!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.644
STINKFACE?

02:23.644 --> 02:27.748
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T KNOW I CALL IT THAT.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.818
JUST FORGET IT.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.986
THANK YOU, BENNY.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.788
YOU'RE WELCOME.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.826
THIS ISN'T OVER, MOM.
I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.629
OH, COME ON, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER A BIRTHDAY.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.998
YES, IT IS, BECAUSE WE NEVER
CELEBRATED ANY OF MY BIRTHDAYS.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.667
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
WHAT ABOUT THAT TIME
YOU WERE LITTLE,

02:48.502 --> 02:50.538
AND I GAVE YOU THAT BIG PARTY
AT THE PARK?

02:50.538 --> 02:54.408
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A BARBECUE
AND FIREWORKS AND EVERYTHING.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.777
THAT WAS THE 4th OF JULY!

03:00.581 --> 03:02.550
SO WHO WANTS TO
GET THE BALL ROLLING, HUH?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.785
WHO'S GOT A STORY
ABOUT MY MOM?

03:06.153 --> 03:07.855
I'LL GO FIRST.

03:07.855 --> 03:11.091
HEY, ANGIE, THIS IS A ROAST.
IT'S KIND OF NOT YOUR THING.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.126
OH, YEAH? WATCH THIS.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.628
(clears throat)

03:14.628 --> 03:18.932
WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT BENNY?
SHE'S A PISTOL.

03:18.932 --> 03:23.136
EVERY YEAR, SHE GIVES ME
THE SAME PRESENT FOR CHRISTMAS--

03:23.136 --> 03:24.805
NOTHING!

03:29.610 --> 03:32.380
YOUR ONLY WAY OUT OF THIS
IS TO DANCE OFFSTAGE.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.747
THAT'S JUVENILE.

03:33.747 --> 03:37.285
IS YOUR NEXT JOKE
FUNNIER THAN THAT ONE?

03:37.285 --> 03:39.853
THANK YOU! WHOO-HOO!

03:39.853 --> 03:41.855
PARTY!

03:41.855 --> 03:44.525
ERNIE, YOU'RE UP.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.428
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

03:47.428 --> 03:50.531
BENNY'S SO OLD,
SHE ALMOST GOT ON NOAH'S ARK,

03:50.531 --> 03:53.767
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND
THE FEMALE OF HER SPECIES!

03:55.669 --> 04:00.073
I GUESS IF ANYONE WOULD KNOW
ABOUT NOT FINDING A FEMALE,

04:00.073 --> 04:01.942
IT'D BE YOU.

04:01.942 --> 04:06.914
HEY, THIS IS YOUR ROAST.
YOU DON'T DO ME.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.750
NO ONE DOES.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.819
THANK YOU!

04:11.819 --> 04:15.823
WHOO! PARTY!

04:15.823 --> 04:18.659
I'D LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS
ABOUT MY NEW ROOMMATE.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.694
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS,

04:20.694 --> 04:23.831
BUT BENNY IS
A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON.

04:23.831 --> 04:28.436
WHY ELSE WOULD SHE TAKE OFF
FOR CHRISTMAS, HANUKKAH,

04:28.436 --> 04:32.072
RAMADAN... KWANZAA?

04:32.072 --> 04:36.043
THESE ARE THE JOKES, PEOPLE.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.881
OKAY, MOVING ON.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.453
ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE
A REAL SPECIAL TREAT.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.154
WE'RE GONNA GO BACK
IN TIME.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.624
WAY BACK--IT'S 1965.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.994
AND A NEW WORKER HAS JUST JOINED
THE POWERS BROTHERS--

04:53.994 --> 04:58.399
BENITA LOPEZ!

05:08.342 --> 05:10.778
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:10.778 --> 05:14.582
I NEED A SMOKE AND A BEER.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.686
HEY, NOW LET'S FAST-FORWARD
TO THE '80s!

05:25.859 --> 05:30.631
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEED A SMOKE AND A BEER.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.902
NOW IT'S THE '90s!

05:37.104 --> 05:41.875
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEED A SMOKE AND A BEER.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.381
AND THIS IS BENNY DURING
LAST WEEK'S EARTHQUAKE!

05:51.419 --> 05:53.387
YOU KNOW WHAT?!

05:53.387 --> 05:56.790
(All) I NEED A SMOKE
AND A BEER!

05:58.792 --> 06:01.929
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

06:04.965 --> 06:08.101
* ALL MY FRIENDS

06:08.101 --> 06:09.670
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER *

06:20.180 --> 06:21.014
HEY.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.082
HEY.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.685
WHOO! YOU MIGHT AS WELL
FLAG ME NOW.

06:24.685 --> 06:27.455
THERE'S ABOUT TO BE
AN ILLEGAL USE OF HANDS.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.558
YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.594
I'M GUESSING YOUR MOM
WASN'T AT WORK AGAIN TODAY?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.263
NOPE. FIVE DAYS IN A ROW.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.833
AND THE FACTORY FLOOR'S LIKE OZ
AFTER THEY KILL THE WITCH.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.636
PEOPLE ARE SINGING.
THEY'RE HAPPY.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.605
I GOT COURAGE.

06:44.605 --> 06:48.408
AREN'T YOU WORRIED
ABOUT HER?

06:48.408 --> 06:51.445
NO, SHE'S TAKING PERSONAL DAYS
TO LOOK FOR AN APARTMENT.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.714
WELL, I THINK THAT STUNT
YOU PULLED AT THE FACTORY

06:53.714 --> 06:55.415
REALLY HURT HER FEELINGS.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.417
HEY, I WAS JUST
GETTING BACK AT HER

06:57.417 --> 06:59.052
FOR MAKING ME MISS
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.622
I ACTUALLY REMEMBERED
THIS YEAR.
EVEN IF SHE DID TRICK YOU,

07:01.622 --> 07:03.624
WHAT YOU DID TO HER
WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.626
SOMETIMES YOU CAN BE
SO INSENSITIVE.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.495
YOU'RE JUST TOO SENSITIVE

07:07.495 --> 07:09.597
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
GROW UP LOPEZ.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.998
WE'RE HARD.
WE CAN TAKE ANYTHING.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.900
YEAH, RIGHT.

07:14.468 --> 07:17.170
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
WATCH THIS.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.607
HEY, MAX, THE OWLS CALLED.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.743
THEY'RE DONE NESTING.
VATO, YOU CAN CUT YOUR HAIR.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.548
CINDY PORTER SAID
I HAVE BIG EARS.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.851
IF I CUT MY HAIR,
SHE'LL NEVER LOVE ME!

07:32.620 --> 07:35.756
LITTLE PIG-NOSED
CINDY PORTER?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.892
GET YOUR HAIR OUT OF YOUR EYES!
SHE'S NASTY!

07:43.497 --> 07:46.033
I LIKE NASTY.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.239
(telephone rings)

07:54.975 --> 07:56.109
HELLO?

07:56.109 --> 07:59.547
OH, HEY, BENNY,
YOU WANT TO TALK TO GEORGE?

08:01.248 --> 08:05.452
UH, OKAY,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.020
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.355
WHAT'D SHE WANT?

08:08.355 --> 08:11.959
SHE WANTS ME TO PICK HER UP
SOME EXTRA STRENGTH ASPIRIN.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.862
IS SHE SICK?
I DON'T KNOW.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.865
SHE KEPT SAYING
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

08:17.865 --> 08:22.135
HONEY, YOU REALLY
HURT HER FEELINGS.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.471
YOU NEED TO GO OVER THERE
AND APOLOGIZE TO YOUR MOM.

08:24.471 --> 08:27.174
WHAT? YOU THINK SHE'S STILL
THAT UPSET ABOUT WHAT I DID?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.709
YES!

08:28.709 --> 08:30.978
JUST IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE AN AGING WOMAN

08:30.978 --> 08:33.814
IN A SOCIETY
OBSESSED WITH BEAUTY,

08:33.814 --> 08:35.783
ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT GAINING WEIGHT,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.350
NOTICING EVERY WRINKLE,

08:37.350 --> 08:41.154
FINDING HAIRS IN PLACES
THAT THEY JUST DON'T BELONG!

08:43.691 --> 08:46.827
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I'M NOT AS TURNED ON

08:46.827 --> 08:49.563
AS I WAS WHEN
I FIRST WALKED IN HERE.

08:49.563 --> 08:52.199
ARE YOU GOING OR WHAT?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.202
YES, I'M GOING, BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

08:55.202 --> 08:56.704
IT'S NOT EASY BEING
AN AGING MALE

08:56.704 --> 08:58.338
IN THIS SOCIETY, EITHER.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.740
I GOTTA WORRY ABOUT

08:59.740 --> 09:02.643
BECOMING MORE AND MORE
DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.011
WATCH OUT. HELLO.

09:05.378 --> 09:09.282
SO, UM, IS THAT WHAT THOSE LINES
ARE AROUND YOUR MOUTH?

09:09.282 --> 09:10.718
DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING?

09:10.718 --> 09:14.054
WHAT? WHAT LINES?
I MOISTURIZE EVERY MORNING.

09:24.164 --> 09:28.168
WELL, WELL, WELL.

09:28.168 --> 09:31.371
MR. GEORGE LOPEZ.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.574
I CAN'T SAY
I DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING.

09:36.309 --> 09:39.112
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE AWKWARD.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.616
YOUR MOM'S HERE.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.485
GINA,
I'M HERE TO SEE MY MOM.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.688
OH, I GET IT.

09:47.688 --> 09:52.693
THE CAT AND MOUSE GAME
CONTINUES.

09:52.693 --> 09:53.927
BENNY.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.163
MEOW.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.401
GEORGE?

10:01.401 --> 10:03.871
I TOLD ANGIE
I WANTED HER TO COME OVER.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.472
HEY, DID YOU
BRING THE ASPIRIN?

10:05.472 --> 10:08.642
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, ANYWAY?

10:08.642 --> 10:11.845
I HAD A MINOR PROCEDURE DONE.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.014
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:14.014 --> 10:17.718
TELL ME IF YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.834
MY GOD, MOM,
YOU SWALLOWED A BOUNCY HOUSE!

10:38.571 --> 10:40.708
OH...

10:50.417 --> 10:52.385
DID YOU SEE YOUR MOM?

10:55.588 --> 10:58.792
OH, YEAH.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.895
WHAT DID SHE NEED
THE ASPIRIN FOR?

11:04.464 --> 11:07.167
SHE HAD SOME SWELLING.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.306
SHE'S GONNA NEED
ABOUT 200 MORE BOTTLES.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.574
WHAT?

11:14.574 --> 11:16.877
LOOK, I GOTTA WARN YOU.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.747
MY MOM'S GOT
A NEW SET OF CHI-CHIS.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.818
YOU'RE GONNA SEE THEM WALK
THROUGH THAT DOOR ANY SECOND

11:24.818 --> 11:26.787
AND MY MOM
ABOUT A MINUTE LATER.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.123
SHE GOT BREAST IMPLANTS?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.325
NO, THESE ARE
MORE THAN IMPLANTS.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.426
THE CAST OF "LOST"

11:33.426 --> 11:37.130
IS TRYING TO FIND THEIR WAY
OFF THE RIGHT ONE.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.533
THE LEFT ONE IS HOSTING
THE WINTER OLYMPICS!

11:40.533 --> 11:43.003
CARMEN, MAX, LISTEN.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.005
YOUR GRANDMA'S GONNA BE

11:45.005 --> 11:47.007
WALKING THROUGH THAT DOOR
ANY SECOND, OKAY?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.009
SHE'S GONNA LOOK
A LITTLE DIFFERENT,

11:49.009 --> 11:52.245
SO DON'T STARE,
AND DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.713
HEY.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.887
DAMN, GRANDMA,
YOUR BOOBS ARE HUGE!

12:03.390 --> 12:04.391
MAX!

12:04.391 --> 12:06.827
NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.362
THE KIDS ARE OLD ENOUGH
TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

12:09.362 --> 12:13.066
KIDS, THERE COMES A TIME
IN EVERY WOMAN'S LIFE

12:13.066 --> 12:14.734
WHEN HER BODY
STARTS TO CHANGE.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.404
THAT'S NATURAL,
AND IT'S GOOD.

12:17.404 --> 12:21.909
UNLESS YOUR SON POINTS IT OUT
TO EVERYONE AT WORK.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.046
THEN YOU CAN CRY,

12:26.046 --> 12:28.348
OR YOU CAN GO OUT
AND BUY YOURSELF

12:28.348 --> 12:31.919
ANOTHER SET
OF SWEATER PUPPIES.

12:34.121 --> 12:38.391
YOUR PUPPIES ARE CRUSHING
THE GARLIC BREAD.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.434
I'M SORRY.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.543
THEY'RE STILL A LITTLE NUMB.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.512
GRANDMA, YOU'RE JUST
OBJECTIFYING YOURSELF

12:59.512 --> 13:00.814
TO PLEASE MEN.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.550
EXACTLY.
THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.453
HELLO, EVERYONE.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.488
ANGIE, GOT THE WINE.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.058
AY, DIOS MÃ­O!

13:11.058 --> 13:13.426
BOMBAS ATÃ³MICAS!

13:13.426 --> 13:18.465
NO, NO, I MEAN I LOVE WHAT
YOU'VE DONE WITH YOUR HAIR.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.335
HAVE YOU NOTICED HER BREASTS?

13:24.204 --> 13:25.939
KIDS, GIVE US A MINUTE.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.441
WE NEED TO TALK
TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.514
MOM, DID YOU DO THIS BECAUSE OF
WHAT I SAID AT THE FACTORY?

13:34.514 --> 13:35.916
YEAH, I DID.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.251
YOU MADE A FOOL
OUT OF ME, GEORGE.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.189
BUT NO ONE IS EVER GONNA
MAKE FUN OF MY BODY AGAIN.

13:44.424 --> 13:48.328
BENNY, HOW COULD
YOU AFFORD THOSE?

13:48.328 --> 13:51.932
WELL, I SPENT THE MONEY I WAS
SAVING UP FOR MY NEW APARTMENT.

13:51.932 --> 13:56.103
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
GET A PLACE OF MY OWN,

13:56.103 --> 13:59.572
BUT AT LEAST I'LL LOOK HOT.

13:59.572 --> 14:04.677
SO YOU THINK THOSE
ARE WHAT MEN REALLY WANT?

14:04.677 --> 14:07.247
WHY DON'T YOU ASK YOUR DAD?

14:07.247 --> 14:10.317
HE HASN'T TAKEN HIS EYES
OFF THEM SINCE HE GOT HERE.

14:10.317 --> 14:14.454
I'M ONLY VIEWING THEM
AS A DOCTOR.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.559
AND WHAT IS
THE GOOD DOCTOR'S OPINION?

14:19.559 --> 14:22.095
OH, THEY'RE YUMMY.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.968
DADDY!

14:27.968 --> 14:32.572
I'M OLDER NOW,
AND I SAY WHAT I LIKE.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.909
AND I LIKE!

14:39.446 --> 14:43.116
GEORGE, YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.452
NOW THAT YOU HAD TIME
TO GET USED TO THESE,

14:45.452 --> 14:48.922
WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK
OF MY BREASTS?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.093
THEY LOOK NICE.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.128
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

15:00.033 --> 15:03.703
WHY DID YOU LIE TO HER?

15:03.703 --> 15:05.205
SHE LOOKS RIDICULOUS!

15:05.205 --> 15:07.040
YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR MOM
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.042
LOOK, ANGIE, I'M THE REASON

15:09.042 --> 15:10.510
SHE MADE THE MISTAKE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.246
I CAN'T OPEN MY MOUTH
AND HURT HER FEELINGS AGAIN.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.315
WELL, WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW
WHEN SHE GOES TO WORK?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.084
YOU KNOW PEOPLE
ARE GONNA MAKE FUN OF HER.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.486
NO, THEY'RE NOT,
BECAUSE I'M-A PROTECT HER.

15:19.486 --> 15:24.024
I'M GONNA KEEP HER SAFE
AND AWAY FROM ANY SHARP OBJECTS.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.129
I'D HATE TO HAVE
THOSE THINGS POP

15:29.129 --> 15:31.698
AND HAVE HER FLY AROUND THE ROOM
LIKE A CARTOON.

15:35.368 --> 15:39.139
SO TO RECAP--JOKES ABOUT
SOMEONE'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

15:39.139 --> 15:40.807
COULD BE CONSIDERED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT,

15:40.807 --> 15:44.577
NO MATTER HOW LARGE THEY ARE--
YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.779
MORNING, EVERYONE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.082
I COULDN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO WATCH ON TV--

15:49.082 --> 15:53.720
HBO, CINEMAX OR... SHOWTIME!

15:55.322 --> 15:58.725
GOLLY!
GOLLY TO THAT ONE, TOO!

15:58.725 --> 16:00.793
ALL RIGHT.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.762
I'VE HEARD FROM ERNIE.

16:02.762 --> 16:06.199
WHAT DO THE REAL MEN THINK?

16:06.199 --> 16:08.535
THEY LOVE 'EM!
BUT THEY CAN'T SAY ANYTHING

16:08.535 --> 16:10.737
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.541
NOW EVERYONE BACK TO WORK.
YOU HEARD ME. BACK TO WORK.

16:14.541 --> 16:18.545
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU
WHEN YOU BARK ORDERS.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.247
UNWELCOME.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.486
OH, WAIT A SECOND,
GEORGE.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.022
I WANNA HEAR WHAT THE GUYS
ARE SAYING.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.592
MAN, CAN YOU BELIEVE SHE
ACTUALLY THINKS SHE LOOKS GOOD?
I KNOW. IT'S SAD.

16:32.592 --> 16:35.362
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF PUTTING NEW HEADLIGHTS

16:35.362 --> 16:37.764
ON A CAR
THAT'S ALREADY TOTALED?

16:41.734 --> 16:43.670
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MOM.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.239
DO THESE REALLY LOOK
THAT RIDICULOUS?

16:46.239 --> 16:49.476
YEAH, THEY DO.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.478
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING BEFORE?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.680
YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME
AT THE HOUSE!

16:53.680 --> 16:56.349
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU LET ME
WALK IN HERE LOOKING LIKE THIS!

16:56.349 --> 16:58.318
I DIDN'T WANT TO
HURT YOUR FEELINGS AGAIN.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.820
YEAH, GREAT JOB WITH THAT.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.756
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET SOMETHING
MORE NATURAL-LOOKING

17:03.756 --> 17:04.924
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.359
OH, I WANTED TO.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.828
BUT THAT DOCTOR WAS WORSE
THAN A CAR SALESMAN.

17:08.828 --> 17:13.266
I'M SURPRISED THERE ISN'T
A CD CHANGER IN ME SOMEWHERE.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.402
CAN'T YOU GET THEM
TAKEN OUT OR REDUCED?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.237
NO, I CAN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING, GEORGE.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.072
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE MONEY!

17:19.072 --> 17:21.074
I AM STUCK
LOOKING LIKE THIS!

17:21.074 --> 17:23.576
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT.
THANKS A LOT.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.378
MOM, WHAT CAN I DO?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.713
NOTHING.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.582
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
THE MONEY TO CHANGE THESE,

17:29.582 --> 17:31.384
WHICH YOU WON'T.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.586
ALL RIGHT, WHAT IF I DID?
YEAH, RIGHT.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.089
MOM, LOOK,
IT'S MY FAULT, ALL RIGHT?

17:36.089 --> 17:39.359
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE MONEY.

17:39.359 --> 17:42.529
WELL, IT'S THE LEAST
YOU CAN DO.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.165
AND I'M-A GIVE YOU A RIDE
TO THE DOCTOR'S TOMORROW, OKAY?

17:45.165 --> 17:47.300
DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.169
I'LL DRIVE SLOW
OVER THE SPEED BUMPS.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.504
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.412
HEY, WHAT DID
THE DOCTOR SAY?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.281
WELL, WE AGREED ON THE SIZE,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.416
AND I'M HAVING
THE BREAST REDUCTION NEXT WEEK.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.718
(lisping)
YEAH, IT'S ALL GOOD.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.320
I'LL BE IN THE GARAGE.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.756
WHAT? WHY DO YOU
SOUND LIKE THAT?

18:09.756 --> 18:13.460
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOW HER
SOONER OR LATER, PRINCESS.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.273
OH, NO.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.242
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.845
WELL, THAT DOCTOR
WAS PRETTY CONVINCING.

18:32.845 --> 18:36.316
HE TALKED GEORGE
INTO GETTING A BOTOX SHOT

18:36.316 --> 18:40.353
TO GET RID OF THE WRINKLES
AROUND HIS MOUTH.

18:40.353 --> 18:43.290
IS THAT TRUE?

18:43.290 --> 18:45.592
HE SAID I'D LOOK YOUNGER!

18:45.592 --> 18:47.760
PLEASE TELL ME
THIS ISN'T PERMANENT.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.997
NO, THE NERVES ARE PARALYZED
JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.466
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT
FOR POINTING OUT MY WRINKLES

18:53.466 --> 18:56.803
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

18:56.803 --> 18:58.505
WHAT?

18:58.505 --> 19:01.308
I SAID THIS IS
ALL YOUR FAULT...

19:01.308 --> 19:03.610
FORGET IT!
YOU NEVER LISTEN!

19:06.213 --> 19:09.516
OH, GEORGE, NOW THAT
I'VE GOT YOUR CASH,

19:09.516 --> 19:13.486
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT YOU TO SEE.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.121
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:15.121 --> 19:18.491
OH... YEAH!

19:18.491 --> 19:22.462
FINALLY, THE REAL TWINS
CAN BREATHE.

19:24.631 --> 19:28.167
NO MAN NEEDS MORE
THAN WHAT I GOT, ANYWAY.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.836
WHAT? YOU FAKED IT?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.638
YES, ELEPHANT MAN.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.676
I FAKED THE WHOLE THING.

19:36.676 --> 19:42.882
YOU DON'TEVER, EVER
HUMILIATE ME AT WORK AGAIN.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.618
BUT YOU ACTUALLY
WENT TO THE DOCTOR.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.520
YEAH, AND I WENT
LAST WEEK, TOO.

19:47.520 --> 19:51.424
THAT'S WHEN HE GAVE ME
THOSE BABIES TO TEST DRIVE.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.827
DID YOU TELL HIM
TO GIVE ME A BAD BOTOX SHOT?

19:58.665 --> 20:01.734
NO, GEORGE,
THAT WAS ICING ON THE CAKE.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.038
WAIT A MINUTE--THE MONEY
I GAVE YOU FOR THE SURGERY.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.708
MOM, I WANT THAT BACK!
OH, THAT'S THE BEST PART.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.810
I ALREADY SPENT IT
ON MY NEW APARTMENT.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.513
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET
FOR MAKING FUN OF ME.

20:13.513 --> 20:17.083
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:17.083 --> 20:21.588
I NEED A SMOKE AND A BEER.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.563
HOW YOU DOING?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.466
IT'S GETTING BETTER.
I CAN FEEL MY LIP.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.942
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

20:42.942 --> 20:44.611
BUT CAN YOU
SKIP OUR MEETING TOMORROW

20:44.611 --> 20:46.479
WITH MAX'S SPECIAL ED TEACHER?

20:46.479 --> 20:49.282
YOU EMBARRASSED OF ME?

20:49.282 --> 20:51.451
NO.

20:51.451 --> 20:55.254
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST KISS ME.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
NO.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.426
KISS ME!

20:59.426 --> 21:02.929
I'M NOT A MONSTER.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.731
OKAY.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.967
BUT IF I'M GONNA DO THIS,
YOU HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.803
MMM.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.877
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THAT'S BETTER THAN USUAL.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.080
THE STINKFACE!

21:21.080 --> 21:24.384
NEVER DO NOTHING!
