He recently bought
a pair of leather cuffs
here at your shop.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.510
We sell an array of restraints.
You'll have to be more specific.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.929
Black leather
wrist and ankle restraints.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.181
Silver spiked collar
connected by chains.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.434
-Uh-huh.
-Ring a bell?

14:53.434 --> 14:56.937
Those could be our
Beast-Master cuffs.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.950
Right.
Those are the ones.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.079
Do you recognize him?

15:14.079 --> 15:16.874
-Do I legally have to say?
-What's your name?

15:16.874 --> 15:20.294
-Lori Gittman.
-We're investigating
a felony, Lori.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.964
You withhold information,
you're obstructing,
which is a felony too.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.843
Okay.
So I recognize him.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.929
What about people he'd
frequent the shop with?

15:29.929 --> 15:33.307
-Got any pictures?
-No.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.560
There's this heavy woman,
um, with dark red hair.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.522
Usually came in with him.
Bought a lot of
dominatrix stuff.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.984
And some pretty ballsy
lingerie for a woman of
her proportion.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.904
-Did she die?
-No.

15:46.904 --> 15:50.908
-He's not with us anymore.
-Uh-oh.

15:50.908 --> 15:54.328
Do you remember anyone
other than the heavyset
woman being with him?

15:54.328 --> 15:57.122
He'd come in by himself
sometimes, but when
he was with someone else,

15:57.122 --> 16:00.042
it was always
with her.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.126
-Okay. Thanks a lot.
-Okay.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.671
I think her name was Geri.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.007
Great.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.431
♪♪

16:16.141 --> 16:18.686
Have a seat, Mr. Fernandez.

16:26.568 --> 16:30.322
This here's a $1,200 suit.
You want me to sit in
someone's coffee cake crumbs?

16:30.322 --> 16:32.574
Maid's day off.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.952
Hold my men, keep us all
from a day's pay.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.579
Look at it
like a mourning period
for Emilio Lopez.

16:37.579 --> 16:39.748
Emilio was solid
with the coalition.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.792
Would've wanted us
we kept keeping on.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.962
Both coalition officers,
you and him
must've been tight?

16:44.962 --> 16:47.006
-Sure.
-Or not.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.174
Don't speak bad of the dead.

16:49.174 --> 16:53.637
-Suppose he was still around?
-Then probably be running
his mouth, preaching.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.056
Aren't the coalitions for
the workers to speak up?

16:56.056 --> 17:00.227
That's the political side,
what Lopez did.
I did the business part--

17:00.227 --> 17:02.187
getting people work,
food on the table.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.482
-You tell me what's better.
-How about the no-show jobs
and shakedowns?

17:05.482 --> 17:08.193
-How'd Lopez feel
about those?
-Don't take your meaning.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.988
Site bosses tighten you up
to keep trouble out.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.408
Emilio want a piece
of that money, Joe?

17:14.408 --> 17:16.201
I wasn't even
at the site, all right?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.370
Is that a yes on wanting
some of your action, Joe?

17:18.370 --> 17:22.291
Emilio wasn't down
for lining his pockets.
Big man of the people.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.210
Lopez mention to you
he was starting
his own coalition?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.421
I heard some of that talk.
Then from there...

17:27.421 --> 17:30.257
he was gonna stand up
for the community,
then city politics.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.259
Then next,
Herman Badillo.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.262
Nothing worse than a guy
with dreams, huh, Joe?

17:35.262 --> 17:37.681
Didn't like him,
and I didn't kill him.

17:37.681 --> 17:41.060
Wasn't at the site.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.686
-(sighs)
-Maybe you two got
a hard-on for me...

17:42.686 --> 17:45.939
'cause I make six figures
and don't even have
a high school diploma.

17:45.939 --> 17:48.442
That it?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.569
Bye, Fernandez.
Let's go.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.749
There.
Uh, the shooting
was at 7:20, right?

18:03.749 --> 18:06.043
Yeah.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.337
You need some batteries
in here, Lieu.

18:16.178 --> 18:20.099
Uh-huh. That's the tube steak's
head of the None Forgotten.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.937
-Bluestone.
-Yeah. Puts a bat
in his hand, but no gun.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.607
Main fighting's on the right.
This guy's coming from
the opposite direction.

18:28.607 --> 18:32.694
Isn't that that Ray Harvey guy
that Greg and James were
talking to here in the squad?

18:33.487 --> 18:35.948
Ready to make arrests?

18:38.075 --> 18:41.912
Maybe behind Bluestone
showing no piece,
you rule him out as a suspect.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.498
Look to him for a push
who he thinks did it.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.501
Sister Sun Ray--
says she's got something
for you on this.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.919
Yeah. What kind of
trouble is she in?

18:48.919 --> 18:51.797
-Took a policy collar.
-Yeah, let's chat
with her first.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.092
I always prefer getting
lied to by professionals.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.976
-Boss.
-What'd you get?

19:03.976 --> 19:05.894
Geri's way into this
Bleecker Street hanging.

19:05.894 --> 19:09.898
-She took the guy out?
-Guy croaked behind some kind
of autoerotic asphyxia,

19:09.898 --> 19:12.526
but she was
definitely involved.

19:12.526 --> 19:14.528
He's, uh--
He's hanging from a hook,

19:14.528 --> 19:17.531
cross-dressed in women's
underwear, bound at
the ankles and wrist.

19:17.531 --> 19:21.618
Minimum, he had to have
a wardrobe assistant, probably
a spotter to hang him up.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.121
Geri's got
a key to his place.
Landlady says, uh,

19:24.121 --> 19:26.748
-she stays there
a couple times a week.
-Salesgirl at the sex store...

19:26.748 --> 19:30.335
this guys scores his toys at
puts him shopping with
Geri three or four times.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.755
-Oh, brother.
-She give anything up
after we left?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.424
She went upstairs to work.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.428
All right, I'll call her
to come down.

19:40.804 --> 19:41.763
Great.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.357
So how'd you wind up with
this policy collar, Sister?

19:52.357 --> 19:56.945
Young man going past
a speed limit,
'legedly holding some slips.

19:56.945 --> 19:59.114
-And he said they
belonged to you?
-There's a numbers runner...

19:59.114 --> 20:02.242
-with an enormous future.
-How about he's my grandnephew.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.536
Drop him from the will.

20:04.536 --> 20:08.457
So, our boss says you may be
able to help us on this
construction site homicide.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.627
I'll tell you what
I believe, which is...

20:11.627 --> 20:14.588
Ray Harvey put out
a high-risk investment,

20:14.588 --> 20:17.090
then lost his patience
and judgment,

20:17.090 --> 20:19.176
wound up shooting
this Spanish Lopez
to death.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.220
What kind of investments
we talking about here?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.597
Ray loaned money to
Joe Fernandez.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.976
Joe about to get his
ass kicked out of bossing
that workingman's coalition...

20:27.976 --> 20:31.104
or this Spanish Lopez
was gonna split it up.

20:31.104 --> 20:35.234
So, Ray got worried
he wasn't gonna get
his money back.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.153
Which you come to know
all about, how?

20:38.153 --> 20:42.199
Ray made a score off me.
He hit $18 on
the Brooklyn number.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.285
Then he come to ask,
how should he invest that money.

20:45.285 --> 20:49.706
'Cause the Sister,
she don't just book policy,
she's an investment adviser too.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.793
Come for guidance.
"Who's worth credit, Sister?"

20:52.793 --> 20:54.795
"What juice
they gonna stand?"

20:54.795 --> 20:57.422
And you gave him Joe Fernandez
to loan money to?

20:57.422 --> 21:00.050
No. I give him
Sam Bluestone,

21:00.050 --> 21:04.554
which is creditworthy,
steady play and pay.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.974
But Sam give Ray
Joe,

21:06.974 --> 21:09.726
which behind all that
trouble Joe had,

21:09.726 --> 21:11.770
Spanish Lopez raising
that rebellion.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.774
-That's how this
all come off.
-Ray kills Lopez.

21:15.774 --> 21:20.362
-Now you on it, baby.
-No. We're not so sure
we're on it yet.

21:20.362 --> 21:23.907
Last night, Sam Bluestone
come to hear...

21:23.907 --> 21:27.536
that Spanish Lopez
is coming down to
a None Forgotten site.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.872
Sam Bluestone heard
that Bronx United was coming
to a None Forgotten site,

21:30.872 --> 21:34.751
-and he told
this to Ray Harvey.
-At my house.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.588
And Bluestone, he heard
this from Joe Fernandez,
that Bronx United was coming?

21:38.588 --> 21:40.799
I guess you'd be right.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.135
So even though their bossin'
from rival coalitions,

21:43.135 --> 21:45.220
these two guys,
they're tight, Sam and Joe?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.764
Behind Sam vouching
for Joe's credit,

21:47.764 --> 21:49.933
onliest way I'd take
a stand on that.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.977
Which your stand would be
they are tight.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.771
So, Ray is at your place
when Bluestone tells him...

21:54.771 --> 21:58.567
that Bronx United is coming
on a bus and Emilio Lopez
is the one that's in charge?

21:58.567 --> 22:01.820
Ray comes up in arms,
talking about,

22:01.820 --> 22:04.781
"Don't pay his debt,
now he gonna take
jobs away too?"

22:04.781 --> 22:07.951
But w-w-wait.
It's Joe Fernandez
that owes Ray money.

22:07.951 --> 22:12.748
But in Ray's mind,
it's Spanish Lopez
keeps him from paying.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.084
Ray said he got something
in his car for Lopez.

22:16.084 --> 22:20.255
He gonna
take him down. .38.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.008
I guess he
told the truth.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.385
You see Ray afterwards?
He tell you what happened?

22:25.385 --> 22:29.473
No. I see Sam
in the hall though
just now.

22:29.473 --> 22:33.143
He took me aside,
said Ray did what he said.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.731
Sam Bluestone says that
Ray killed Emilio Lopez?

22:37.731 --> 22:40.275
Said he saw him do it.

22:42.944 --> 22:44.029
So--

22:44.029 --> 22:47.741
This beef my grandnephew
put me in,

22:47.741 --> 22:49.618
who's gonna
make that go away?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.705
You stood a policy collar
before, haven't you, Sister?

22:53.705 --> 22:55.707
I did when I had to.

22:55.707 --> 23:00.337
'Cause giving up Ray Harvey,
that's a lot of cooperation
to beat a misdemeanor.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.255
What makes the country go?

23:11.640 --> 23:14.935
Believe a word she said,
the passing of Emilio Lopez...

23:14.935 --> 23:17.437
got nothing to do
with coalitions fighting
over jobs...

23:17.437 --> 23:21.066
or blacks versus
Puerto Ricans or none of
the other great issues.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.610
A half-assed shylock
worried over his loan...

23:23.610 --> 23:26.780
murders the poor slob
who isn't even the one
who owes him the money?

23:26.780 --> 23:30.742
Returns us to the large
uncertainty, did that
big blimp tell us the truth?

23:30.742 --> 23:34.037
You think Bluestone's
gonna be of any help,
being that he knows the Sister?

23:34.037 --> 23:37.290
He's got credibility
with me fitting in
the same room with her.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.462
Yeah, we might as well
reach out to Bluestone,

23:42.462 --> 23:44.714
see how he's gonna
try to move us around.

23:47.968 --> 23:51.138
Let's... take another
minute quiet time.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.392
-(knocking)
-Yeah?

23:55.392 --> 23:58.770
-Can I ask a favor, boss?
-Yeah, sure.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.314
Gina's getting her stitches
out at 2:00. She asked
if I'd go with her.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.734
All right,
um, give me a 28,
take a few hours lost time.

24:04.734 --> 24:09.531
-Hey, I really appreciate it.
-So, um, how's Gina doing?

24:09.531 --> 24:12.659
Oh, she has some
emotional concerns.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.579
She's concerned no one's
gonna want to look at her.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.747
Well, her asking you
to be with her...

24:17.747 --> 24:20.417
gives you a good opportunity
to be supportive about that.

24:20.417 --> 24:23.336
Absolutely. Uh, I'm worried
if I don't react well--

24:23.336 --> 24:25.630
-I don't wanna
wince or pull back.
-Yeah.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.757
I'm sure your being there
is gonna be a help.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.886
Yeah, just concentrate
on her. Uh, that's how
I'm thinking about it.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.805
Yeah. So, you'll be
leaving around 1:00?

24:33.805 --> 24:36.808
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay,
that's fine.

24:36.808 --> 24:39.519
-Okay. Thanks.
-Hey, um,

24:40.812 --> 24:43.231
-tell Gina we're all
thinking about her.
-All right.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.781
Gotta go.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.537
-Hi, Geri.
-Hi.

24:57.537 --> 24:59.539
Let's go into
the coffee room.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.334
All right, if you think
that's appropriate.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.008
(clears throat)
We found Tom.

25:10.008 --> 25:13.470
-Was he hanging the way
I described him?
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

25:13.470 --> 25:18.934
Geri, uh, Tom was bound by
his wrists and ankles.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.852
Was it you tied him up?

25:20.852 --> 25:23.980
-Why are you asking me that?
-Because we wanna
know the answer.

25:23.980 --> 25:27.400
-Well, I'm not sure
I want to give it.
-Have we given you any reason...

25:27.400 --> 25:29.528
to feel this has to be
us against you, Geri?

25:29.528 --> 25:32.614
We're trying to establish
as much information as we can.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.075
Oh, please.
Oh, sure.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.372
Geri, since we found
Tom dead, hanging the way
you described,

25:40.372 --> 25:43.333
and I think Diane
mentioned bound at
the wrist and ankles--

25:43.333 --> 25:46.461
You're really having
a good time, aren't you?

25:46.461 --> 25:50.298
And I mentioned
the landlady telling us about
your friendship with Tom,

25:50.298 --> 25:53.009
and that you had
your own key.

25:53.009 --> 25:56.054
Also, we traced some of
the sexual paraphernalia
from that room,

25:56.054 --> 25:58.098
and the clerk at Mother's
identified you...

25:58.098 --> 26:00.559
as having bought
the leather cuffs
we found on Tom.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.562
I'm telling you all
that because I think you
should be more candid.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.356
-No.
-Geri.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.400
Geri, you don't want
embarrassment or confusion...

26:08.400 --> 26:10.485
to wind up creating
an appearance of guilt.

26:10.485 --> 26:12.779

-but you didn't
put him on that hook?
-Because I was in the bathroom.

I was crying, and I guess
I was in there a long time.

You're in the bathroom crying
while he gets on the hook?

He'd done that before?

I'd always thought maybe
we'd had crushes on each other.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.790

and he was really shy.

34:04.417 --> 34:08.588
Turned out we did have crushes.
He said so when we started
talking.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.467

friends here,

34:12.467 --> 34:14.469

past sex restraints...

as I could, 'cause
I'm not pretty.

34:27.648 --> 34:32.111

'cause he was really shy.

34:34.238 --> 34:37.658

into it so much that he
didn't even look at me.

34:37.658 --> 34:43.539

blindfolded and have,
like, private orgasms.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.958

more and more.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.158

six weeks ago...

35:22.411 --> 35:27.083

having other people in

35:29.502 --> 35:33.131
I started

no more. I'm saying what
really went down here."

get jacked up too.

-Were they in on this
with you, Ray?

38:48.909 --> 38:53.706

Sister and Sam okay this guy
for me making the loan.

38:53.706 --> 38:56.917

he ain't paying dick.
-This is Joe Fernandez.

39:12.767 --> 39:16.187
Sam come by saying Lopez
be at the site tomorrow
shaping for jobs.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.522
-Did they tell you to kill him?
-I was drunk!

39:18.522 --> 39:21.317
They had me half-crazy.

39:21.317 --> 39:24.862
Wound him up like
the Energizer Bunny.

39:25.946 --> 39:30.951
Ray, did Bluestone
give you the gun?
Or the Sister?

39:30.951 --> 39:34.330
'Cause they tied you
like a Christmas package.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.457
You ought to
return the favor.

39:39.960 --> 39:43.214
-My gun.
-You sure you don't
wanna lie about that?

39:43.214 --> 39:47.218
I swear to God I wish
I'd never won that money.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.055
Brought me nothing
but worry and misery.

40:00.147 --> 40:04.777
The perfect frame.
Makes me sick.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.987
You think there was
some other reason they
wanted this Lopez dead...

40:06.987 --> 40:09.365
past him queering
their union hustles?

40:09.365 --> 40:14.578
Who knows? Maybe they
break out in hives being
around an honest man.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.581
Such an easy patsy, though,
this poor dope Harvey.

40:17.581 --> 40:20.793
I knew this bookmaker,
John Riley.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.587
When somebody won big,
John'd make a big fuss
paying 'em off.

40:23.587 --> 40:27.842
Give him a good cigar,
next day's racing form.
He'd say to me afterwards,

40:27.842 --> 40:30.052
"I'm just letting 'em
hold the money a while."

40:30.052 --> 40:32.054
Yeah, that's
the Sister and Ray.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.849
It really used to
piss me off. It's like
it wasn't a fair fight.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.184
Not like how it
is usually, huh?

40:37.184 --> 40:38.185
Yeah.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.813
I'll tell you,
I'm in for justice here.
So, you just trust me.

40:40.813 --> 40:44.233
-It's one of them.
-Well, look who's a little
more speechifyin'.

40:44.233 --> 40:46.235
You got a None Forgotten
in custody?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.821
Who told you, Joe?
Your bed pals,
Sam and the Sister?

40:48.821 --> 40:51.824
People gonna know how Emilio
died at a black man's hand.

40:51.824 --> 40:55.035
There's gonna be employment
for boricuas or blood
will run at the sites.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.830
Joe's gonna go to
the papers with this
phony race homicide,

40:57.830 --> 41:00.040
try to scare up
some more no-show jobs.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.626
Hypocrite bastard.
You're like
Monday Night Wrestling.

41:02.626 --> 41:07.673
Let me tell you something, Joe.
When you take this to the
papers, you know what you're
gonna do?

41:07.673 --> 41:10.676
-You're gonna be pledging
some money to Lopez's widow.
-That's already in the works.

41:10.676 --> 41:14.221
Well, that's good 'cause
you're gonna draw a contract up
with one of our D.A.'s here,

41:14.221 --> 41:16.974
-a trust for his
widow and children.
-Already in the works.

41:16.974 --> 41:21.103
You're gonna write it
here, Joe. So it's all nice
and legal and binding...

41:21.103 --> 41:23.063
before you walk out,
or this whole thing
is going...

41:23.063 --> 41:26.108
to the D.A.'s office
on a conspiracy charge.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.655
I'm happy to make
that commitment.

41:31.655 --> 41:35.451
-Great.
-Let me hunt up a wonderful
attorney acquaintance of ours.

41:35.451 --> 41:41.165
A Leo Cohen. Why don't you
sit down there, Joe.
Go on. Have a seat.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.547
How's it going with you?

41:50.424 --> 41:54.720
I was, um--
I was wondering about
your after work plans.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.722
There's nothing on my calendar.

41:56.722 --> 42:02.728
Hmm. And, uh,
would that be for
the foreseeable future?

42:02.728 --> 42:07.691
How is that
they say in your program?
One day at a time.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.902
I can do it that way.

42:09.902 --> 42:13.322
Leo?
Andy Sipowicz. Yeah.

42:13.322 --> 42:16.909
Could you, uh, just trot on
upstairs here for a moment?

42:16.909 --> 42:19.703
Yeah. Thank you.
(handset settles in cradle)

42:19.703 --> 42:21.664

42:34.552 --> 42:37.179
-Boy, that was
just great.
-Thanks, James.

42:37.179 --> 42:40.558
Really. Yeah. Your mom
teach you your cooking?

42:40.558 --> 42:42.393
My mom and my aunt.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.937
I really enjoy spending
this time with you, Gina.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.565
I could get into being
a man of leisure.

42:51.068 --> 42:55.281
I really appreciated it.
Just as far as, um--

42:57.366 --> 43:00.536
You know, she changed
her commitment.
She's not coming back.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.955
This is your roommate?

43:02.955 --> 43:06.917
Said she made
another arrangement
for the new semester.

43:07.126 --> 43:10.379
She's gonna be
picking up her stuff.

43:10.379 --> 43:14.008
-I've been upset on that.
-Financially?

43:14.008 --> 43:16.010
Financially and--

43:16.010 --> 43:20.222
I know she was upset
about my appearance.
It disturbed her.

43:20.222 --> 43:23.809
-That's baloney.
-No, she said so, James.

43:23.809 --> 43:26.562
Well, the heck with her!
That's nonsense.

43:26.562 --> 43:28.772
And financially,
you're coming back
to work.

43:28.772 --> 43:31.567
If you need some tiding over,
that's no problem at all.

43:31.567 --> 43:35.571
That's not necessary.
I got my confirmation savings.

43:35.571 --> 43:38.782
It's mostly you being here.
It's helped me a lot.

43:38.782 --> 43:40.868
It's my pleasure.

43:43.662 --> 43:47.625
Anyways, I know you got
an 8:00-to-4:00.

43:50.878 --> 43:53.255
Don't take this
as being forward,

43:53.255 --> 43:56.842
but if you wanted some
company tonight, I could stay up
in your roommate's loft there.

43:56.842 --> 43:59.637
If you'd like to stay,
I'd be happy for you to.

43:59.637 --> 44:02.640
I'd like to.
Sure.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.059
But if you
sleep up in her loft,
I'd worry all night...

44:05.059 --> 44:07.853
that you'd sit up
in a strange place
and smash your head.

44:07.853 --> 44:11.190
Yeah. I suppose that
could occur. Sure.

44:13.525 --> 44:16.028
And as far as me
sleeping up there,

44:16.028 --> 44:19.448
I could always fib and say
I'm afraid of heights.

44:19.448 --> 44:22.242
You don't gotta fib.

44:22.242 --> 44:25.037
We could both stay in there.

44:26.038 --> 44:29.166
That's where I was
hoping we'd come out.
