A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:08.800 --> 00:12.012
INTERNATIONAL TEXTILE DESIGN

00:18.768 --> 00:20.395
<i>Antonia has a lot of talent.</i>

00:20.478 --> 00:23.273
<i>She can start this week.</i>
<i>Every day after school.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:32.907
Do you like it?

00:35.493 --> 00:36.327
It's yours.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.206
Welcome to the Royal.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.589
Perfect. Thanks very much. Bye.

00:55.847 --> 00:56.848
I accept.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.690
<i>Hi, Mom. Here's what</i>
<i>we've been preparing for months.</i>

01:05.774 --> 01:08.234
<i>Today's the last rehearsal</i>
<i>before the presentation.</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:11.321
I'm the lead.
Juliet from <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

01:12.030 --> 01:14.741
<i>Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?</i>

01:14.824 --> 01:16.910
This is my Romeo.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.537
His name is Vicente. He's awesome.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.082
Hey! What's this?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.417
-You can't film here.
-Who says?

01:24.501 --> 01:27.128
-We all know it.
-You can't film here, guys.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.089
<i>Sorry. I asked him to film,</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:31.674
but they've explained
very nicely that we can't.

01:32.175 --> 01:36.429
I don't want any more distractions.
This is our last chance. Understand?

01:37.097 --> 01:37.931
Agreed.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.850
There are no more chances.

01:41.684 --> 01:42.936
How are you, Miranda?

01:45.313 --> 01:47.023
Karina, I'm sorry.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.485
I've decided Antonia will be the lead.

01:52.862 --> 01:53.696
Excuse me?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.118
I can delete the video.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.121
-The decision is made.
-I think there's a mistake.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.705
-Let's talk in private.
-No.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.833
There's nothing to talk about.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.335
I was wrong.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.796
But I'm fixing the mistake.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.759
Guys, I want to apologize.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.845
For disrespecting you.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.348
For not having valued your history.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.269
Your sacrifice all these years.

02:24.936 --> 02:25.937
I'm sorry.

02:28.022 --> 02:28.898
Karina,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.152
you don't belong at the Royal.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.738
This is too big for you.

02:37.448 --> 02:40.201
-I've made a huge effort--
-It's not enough.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.288
You come from the street.
They've been studying for years.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.831
Don't you understand, little girl?

02:45.832 --> 02:46.833
You're just

02:47.709 --> 02:49.043
one of Jacobo's fancies.

02:51.671 --> 02:52.505
Just that.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.431
You've made a big mistake.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.731
Guys, to your positions.
There's a lot of work to do.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.573
Aren't you going to do anything?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.033
What can I do?

03:22.285 --> 03:23.912
Have you forgotten where we are?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.497
Where we come from?

03:27.332 --> 03:29.709
No, but this isn't fair to you.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.130
It's not fair. That fucking bitch
is going to pay for this.

03:34.797 --> 03:39.010
You've sweated and struggled, Karina.
That bitch has to pay.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.137
-Karina, let's talk.
-About what?

03:42.472 --> 03:45.850
About what?
How they just fucking humiliated us?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.602
-I understand.
-No, you don't.

03:48.561 --> 03:49.771
This was my fault.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.775
For trusting you and all of these people.

04:25.431 --> 04:28.142
MIRANDA
INCOMING CALL

04:39.862 --> 04:40.863
Hello?

04:52.834 --> 04:53.668
Again.

04:54.335 --> 04:58.172
Five, six, seven, and… Harder.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.142
Very good.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.146
Let's start again.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.107
Five, six, seven, and…

05:20.820 --> 05:21.654
And…

05:27.493 --> 05:28.494
Listen to this.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.417
Vicente will hate me for this.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.594
And? How are you doing?

05:47.263 --> 05:49.057
I'm used to being plan B.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.561
Vis, I had nothing to do
with those decisions.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.980
About you or Karina.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.650
Miranda sought me out, and…

06:01.986 --> 06:03.321
I'm sorry.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.198
Guys, circle.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.367
It's all good.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.828
I want you to put your hearts into it.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.206
There's a lot at stake today.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.792
Thanks for coming back.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.922
Family, let's give it our all!

06:22.715 --> 06:24.759
Royal!

06:26.427 --> 06:28.679
To your positions.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.713
Dude, what's happening?

07:04.882 --> 07:06.175
There are roadworks.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.971
What do we do?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.328
The sidewalk is empty.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.455
Go that way.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.664
What about the car?

07:36.747 --> 07:39.292
Go on. When I have money,
I'll buy you three.

07:39.959 --> 07:40.793
Who's scared?

07:40.877 --> 07:41.919
Go for it!

07:57.852 --> 08:01.105
-Fucking asshole!
-Son of a bitch!

08:32.136 --> 08:33.763
<i>You don't belong at the Royal.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:35.640
<i>This is too big for you.</i>

08:36.933 --> 08:39.936
<i>It's not enough. You come from the street.</i>

08:42.146 --> 08:43.940
<i>You don't belong at the Royal.</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:47.151
<i>You come from the street.</i>

08:49.445 --> 08:51.739
<i>You, you, you come from the street.</i>

08:54.408 --> 08:56.744
<i>You, you, you come from the street.</i>

08:56.827 --> 08:59.580
<i>You don't belong at the Royal.</i>
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:03.292
<i>-You, you come from the street.</i>
<i>-</i> Hey, the music's ready, isn't it?

09:05.962 --> 09:08.005
What's happening? Booth?

09:09.924 --> 09:10.925
What's happening?

10:02.643 --> 10:05.354
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:10.651
<i>For security reasons,</i>
<i>the event has been suspended.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:05.915
How the fuck did they get past security?

11:11.671 --> 11:12.630
Hi, guys.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.346
Did they decide to continue tomorrow?

11:20.429 --> 11:21.263
No…

11:22.473 --> 11:23.849
We won't get another chance.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.688
We're out of the Iberoamericano.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
They're accusing me of discrimination.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.190
-Cheers, motherfucker. We killed it, dude.
-That's right!

12:13.774 --> 12:15.860
Now they know if they mess with a Kaye,

12:15.943 --> 12:18.070
they mess with
the whole hood, motherfucker.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.071
That's right.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.784
They were shitting themselves,
those preppies. We should've filmed them.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.035
There's no point.

12:26.078 --> 12:26.912
Why not?

12:26.996 --> 12:27.830
What for?

12:28.330 --> 12:30.040
Karina.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.336
Dude, Xime, we went there already.
We screwed up their show.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.297
We took revenge. Done!

12:36.380 --> 12:38.549
Now let's concentrate on our stuff.

12:39.341 --> 12:43.095
What's our stuff?
That preppie's still there, remember?

12:43.679 --> 12:46.056
-What are we going to do?
-Girl.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.851
Out, like the rats.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.438
-That video exists thanks to her.
-So we leave her?

12:52.521 --> 12:53.731
Let's leave her, then.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.193
But remember she betrayed Karina
from the get-go. She's not a Kaye.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.029
She betrayed Karina
because you shagged Checho.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.658
Are you defending her?

13:04.742 --> 13:06.285
No, I'm telling the truth.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.079
So am I to blame
for your brother's libido?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.750
You know you shagged Checho
to fuck Antonia over.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.585
So what if I want to fuck her over?

13:15.503 --> 13:18.214
Get a grip.
Decide which side you're on, dude.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.674
-What's up with her?
-Joy messaged.

13:20.758 --> 13:23.344
-We sign the contracts tomorrow.
-Great.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.596
What about me, Karina?

13:29.016 --> 13:30.392
It's okay, all good.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.312
The group won't split up again.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.690
My loves. Punky called me.
He needs the car. Let's go.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.318
Hey ho, let's go.

13:54.166 --> 13:57.837
-Where does it say it is?
-Here it says it's in the spa, but…

14:06.428 --> 14:08.222
Joy's waiting for you to sign.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.685
See you at the rehearsal.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.938
Oh, and there's one too many of you.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.358
Hey, it's all good. Stay calm.

14:19.984 --> 14:20.985
Let's go.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.560
<i>Here's what we'll do.</i>

14:54.643 --> 14:56.145
Tell me, Karina.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.438
Leave me out.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.025
I came to replace my friend.
She has to be in it.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.569
Listen to her. You hear her, Bicho?

15:03.652 --> 15:06.488
You think I have time to waste
on this nonsense?

15:07.489 --> 15:09.074
We have to be professional.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.785
The artist chose
the four who went to the audition.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.704
And those four will be in the video.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.874
We have to be professional.
The artist chose you.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.376
Get the contracts ready.
Give them to those two.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
-It's a change--
-See you at the rehearsal.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.182
-Joy, let me explain.
-Go.

15:39.897 --> 15:40.731
Ximena, no.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.108
This isn't over.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.321
I lost everything in one moment.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.074
They took Dembow away.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.872
Apart from that, I'm homeless, dude.
Fucking hell.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.916
You've still got us.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.505
I fucked up, didn't I?

16:07.675 --> 16:09.760
I fucked it up for myself…

16:13.347 --> 16:15.099
but also with you girls.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.772
The only thing that saves me is dance.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.357
You will dance.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.485
We're going to dance together.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.237
Like always.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.657
Antonia isn't part of this group.

16:35.911 --> 16:36.912
She has to go.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.790
Good. Very good, all of you.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.043
-What do you think of them?
-I think it's really good.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.379
Antonia and Karina to the front, please.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.550
-Have you prepared?
-Yes.

16:51.051 --> 16:52.052
Okay, positions.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.595
Music.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.976
Five, six, seven, eight.

17:07.651 --> 17:08.569
Stop the music.

17:10.154 --> 17:10.988
Antonia.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.948
Your arms are wrong.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.909
-All good?
-Yes, all good.

17:15.993 --> 17:16.994
Correct them.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.955
-Yes.
-Come on. It's okay. Let's start again.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.415
-One more time. Correct them.
-Yes.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.833
-Okay girls, positions.
-Okay.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.210
One more. Music.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.716
Five, six, seven, eight.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.097
-Again, she needs to fix it. Stop.
-Yes, again.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.724
Stop the music.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.976
Antonia, your arms again.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.147
I'm sorry. I'll fix it.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.442
Take a break, girls.
Antonia, correct it, please.

17:48.525 --> 17:49.526
Sorry.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.622
Do you think
I don't realize what you're doing?

18:01.705 --> 18:04.541
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Grow up.

18:41.120 --> 18:48.085
CHAMA
THE PLAN IS WORKING, GIRL.

18:52.339 --> 18:55.259
Grandma, if anything happens,
I'm with Bombita, okay?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.681
I didn't know if I should knock.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.016
What are you doing here?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.269
I'd like to talk to you.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.062
Is that possible?

19:13.193 --> 19:14.111
Not here, though.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.947
No.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.242
I don't feel proud of what I did.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.329
But sometimes
you get carried away with feelings.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.123
It wasn't your fault, Karina.

19:27.249 --> 19:31.712
It wasn't your fault. It was Miranda and I
who pushed you into that situation.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.133
It was an enormous opportunity
to develop in my career,

19:37.217 --> 19:39.094
and I wanted to do something different.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.805
Why did you choose me?

19:42.931 --> 19:46.268
You had Antonia.
Majo was there, who's good too.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.770
Passion overpowered reason.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.400
I wanted to take a risk with you.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.112
Why have you come here?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.203
To ask you to forgive me.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.208
And invite you
to a crazy thing I'm getting into.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.962
I've been hired to do the staging
for an intercollegiate festival.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.757
-I'd love to do it with you.
-And you said yes?

20:18.592 --> 20:19.718
It's work.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.762
What do you say?

20:23.305 --> 20:24.306
I'll pass this time.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.809
I want to focus on my group.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.271
But thank you.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.735
You were the first person
outside of my area to believe in me.

20:38.695 --> 20:42.282
You're smart. You got me to do things

20:43.951 --> 20:45.827
I never imagined I could do.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.539
I feel grateful for that.

20:53.502 --> 20:57.798
Well, I think I'm going to go
because I have things to do.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.724
I hope everything goes well for you.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.554
What are you doing here?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.724
I've called so many times.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.852
I didn't answer
because I didn't want to talk to you.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.271
-Go away, okay?
-No.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.064
I need to talk to you, okay?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.651
If you want, I'll never come back.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.070
But listen to me.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.743
Look, if you came
to say sorry, you'd better go.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.330
-I have a lot to rehearse.
-I was drunk.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.457
Ximena came into my room.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.170
Do you think that's an excuse?

22:20.464 --> 22:23.425
You knew Ximena had it in for me
from the moment she met me.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.260
You let it happen.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.637
You didn't stop.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.015
She won.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.017
She didn't win anything.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.937
Ximena is living her life
while I try to live mine, okay?

22:38.732 --> 22:39.691
She separated us.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.904
Anyway, that's not the point.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.199
I trusted you.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.208
Look, I have a lot to rehearse.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.085
-Please go. Seriously.
-Blondie.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.923
I love you.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.220
I really love you.

23:18.855 --> 23:19.856
Look.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.736
I understand perfectly
why you feel like this.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.740
I fucked up.

23:30.659 --> 23:31.827
Forgive me.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.662
I made a mistake.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.502
But I came here
to tell you I'm not giving up.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.006
I want to make things right with you.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.311
I've had this
since before all this shit happened.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.857
I wanted to give it to you.

24:04.067 --> 24:04.901
Take it.

24:11.199 --> 24:13.994
I wanted them to be
the ones you were wearing that day.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.374
But when I went to get them,
they'd been sold.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.546
So I got these made.

24:27.048 --> 24:30.760
I don't know if they're exactly the same,
but they're like this in my head.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.354
Weren't they like this?

25:11.676 --> 25:12.761
Tell me something.

25:14.304 --> 25:17.307
Do you think your friends
can get rid of the preppie?

25:17.974 --> 25:18.808
Eh?

25:20.769 --> 25:22.229
We're a pack.

25:23.855 --> 25:24.856
A pack of what?

25:26.983 --> 25:28.485
A pack of beasts.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.153
How scary.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.491
A beast never abandons their pack.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.537
Know why I'm asking?

25:40.497 --> 25:43.500
If you want to be in the video,
you have to go straight to it.

25:45.168 --> 25:46.711
And your friends aren't.

25:48.755 --> 25:50.382
Understand what I'm saying?

25:52.676 --> 25:55.011
If you need me to do something for you,

25:56.888 --> 25:59.432
whatever it is, you only have to say it.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.603
Understand?

26:07.065 --> 26:10.443
My people, what's up?
I have some really excellent news.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.739
The first 200 people
to arrive at the set of my music video

26:14.823 --> 26:16.908
<i>will be dancing with me all night.</i>

26:16.992 --> 26:19.911
<i>It's going to be awesome.</i>
<i>The information's below.</i>

26:32.757 --> 26:35.927
-Ximena, what's up?
-<i>Friend, Curro made me an offer.</i>

26:36.011 --> 26:38.597
Girl, I told you,
not with that kind of rash guy.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.182
<i>He can help us with that preppie, though.</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:44.936
That guy is too dangerous. Leave it to me.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.528
Hi, guys.

27:09.169 --> 27:11.087
Let's see you all. Everyone up.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.757
Positions. Second choreography.

27:18.553 --> 27:20.597
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.317
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.363
Stop the music.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.327
-Don't touch me. It hurts.
-I need to look, Antonia.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.411
Easy.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.541
Dude, why?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.586
Me? You came too close.
It was an accident.

27:52.253 --> 27:55.048
-You crossed a line.
-Bombita, get me some ice.

27:55.882 --> 27:56.925
How is she, Bando?

27:57.008 --> 27:59.928
-We should call someone.
-No, I'm fine.

28:00.553 --> 28:02.722
-I swear, I'll be fine.
-Bicho.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.558
Call a paramedic.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.019
No, I'm fine. It's not necessary.

28:08.103 --> 28:10.855
Look, Antonia, I need you at 100%.

28:10.939 --> 28:14.901
Let's wait and see what the doctor says.
Bicho, are you calling?

28:21.866 --> 28:23.493
I don't think it's fractured.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.372
I recommend you get some X-rays
and complete rest.

28:28.998 --> 28:31.042
But I need to dance.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.757
Joy, I'm fine, honestly. I can dance.

28:37.841 --> 28:41.469
I'm going to check something,
and then we'll talk, Antonia.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.679
No, Joy, please.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.432
-Careful.
-Ouch!

28:49.894 --> 28:51.438
That wasn't the way to do it.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.190
You know that wasn't the way.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.067
I told you it was an accident.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.450
Are you gonna lie to me?

29:05.160 --> 29:07.078
-You're gonna lie to me?
-Hey!

29:07.162 --> 29:09.372
We all knew what was happening.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.875
You agreed, Karina. Don't pick on Chama.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.168
I meant by dancing.

29:15.336 --> 29:16.337
Not like this.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.760
What did the paramedic say?

29:22.886 --> 29:24.095
Antonia can't dance.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.475
I explained what happened.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.851
Oh, yes, an accident.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.311
-Of course.
-Was it?

29:35.356 --> 29:38.067
My respects to you, ladies. Hey.

30:01.257 --> 30:02.258
I need a favor.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.929
But don't say no.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.599
One, two, three.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.310
Okay.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.021
-Done?
-Done.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.779
-How does it feel?
-Let's see.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.280
Move it.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.283
There it is.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.835
Do it again.

30:36.918 --> 30:37.919
Girl…

30:38.753 --> 30:40.213
What if you fuck yourself up?

30:41.506 --> 30:42.590
Then I fuck myself up.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.834
-Hey! Hi.
-Hi.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.669
-You're Antonia's replacement.
-Yes.

31:19.752 --> 31:21.796
Let's rehearse.
I want to go over some things.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.881
Okay.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.174
What's up, bro?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.594
-Girl…
-Let's turn it on.

31:27.677 --> 31:30.013
This is very important for me. Thank you.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.850
<i>Because we're dynamite</i>

31:33.933 --> 31:35.894
<i>We're dynamite</i>

31:44.861 --> 31:48.114
One, two, three, four, and five…

31:48.197 --> 31:50.241
-Za, za, za.
-Ready.

31:50.825 --> 31:51.659
I can dance.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.207
Shouldn't you be resting?

32:00.752 --> 32:02.462
They injected me. I'm fine now.

32:03.379 --> 32:04.380
So I can dance.

32:06.466 --> 32:07.425
Okay, show us.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.388
Five, six, seven, eight.

32:21.147 --> 32:22.148
See?

32:23.566 --> 32:24.901
See? I can dance.

32:27.278 --> 32:28.321
I'm fine now.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.577
And you said the ones
the artist approved had to dance.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.789
What do you say?

32:39.707 --> 32:41.834
She should dance. She can dance.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.630
Aren't you going to say anything?

32:45.713 --> 32:47.256
Yes, give her the hat.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.521
It's all good.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.733
All good is all bad.

33:08.820 --> 33:09.821
Thanks.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.493
Hey, where are you?

34:13.301 --> 34:14.427
How's your foot?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.556
Why? Are you going to break the other one?

34:19.390 --> 34:21.392
The idea was never to hurt you, Antonia.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.895
No. What, then?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.065
Kick me out of the group? Very subtle.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.820
Isn't it better
that we each stay in our own world?

34:33.571 --> 34:34.822
What world, Karina?

34:36.199 --> 34:37.867
You turned mine to shit.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.457
-Can I help you?
-So kind.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.668
A bit late
to ease your conscience, isn't it?

34:47.752 --> 34:49.962
I didn't come to fight with you.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.174
Don't play the victim. We were both wrong.

34:53.257 --> 34:57.595
I'm helping you because if it goes badly,
it's not only you who loses. We all lose.

35:02.100 --> 35:02.975
Know what I think?

35:04.018 --> 35:05.812
You and I got off on the wrong foot.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.939
Why?

35:09.232 --> 35:12.610
I should have accepted my place at
the Royal and not put you in the middle.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.446
Then at least I'd have a show to be in.

35:16.572 --> 35:17.573
I fucked it up.

35:21.744 --> 35:23.079
I never should have

35:23.663 --> 35:25.164
left my group.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.961
But we learn from everything, right?

35:32.088 --> 35:34.090
See if the bandage is on properly.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.473
Yes, it's better.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.309
Thanks for everything, Karina.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.603
I've learned a lot from you.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.856
You've always been really good.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.859
And if Pura Kaye is here today…

35:54.777 --> 35:56.028
it's thanks to you.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.160
This is an awesome opportunity.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.622
We're going to give it our all.
Do it well.

36:08.708 --> 36:09.709
Of course.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.880
Girls, to the dressing room. It's time.

37:02.887 --> 37:03.763
Cut!

37:03.846 --> 37:05.932
Girls, let's touch up, please.

37:06.515 --> 37:10.228
Everyone, first positions.
Crowd, come up to the stage.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.274
Camera C.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.193
Okay, guys.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.447
Ready.

37:22.531 --> 37:24.158
Attractions.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.370
Come on, girls, bring it up!

41:41.582 --> 41:46.587
