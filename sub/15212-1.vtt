00:33.000 --> 00:36.700
I can't find the translation
for any of these hieroglyphs.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
That's because you're focusing
on the Fourth Dynasty...

00:42.600 --> 00:48.100
...while these particular glyphs are derived
from Third Dynasty regional variants.

00:49.800 --> 00:54.000
"And so through these stones,
we summon down the powers of the gods. "

00:54.100 --> 00:55.800
Slow down. Slow down.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.300
A square on every level.

00:59.000 --> 01:03.331
No more than. 01 percent error
in any of these walls.

01:03.331 --> 01:06.968
As Napoleon himself exclaimed:

01:09.359 --> 01:12.454
And for 4000 years,
until just 100 years ago...

01:12.846 --> 01:15.567
...it stood as the tallest
structure on Earth.

01:20.738 --> 01:23.703
Look at those support stones
along the edge.

01:24.057 --> 01:27.630
If even one of these stones
was but an inch out of alignment...

01:28.468 --> 01:31.727
...the entire Great Pyramid
would come crashing down.

01:36.244 --> 01:38.466
How did they do it?

01:38.883 --> 01:42.360
How did these primitives...

01:42.748 --> 01:44.440
...unlock the majesty...

01:44.957 --> 01:47.091
...the mystery of trigonometry...

01:47.685 --> 01:50.075
...and calculus...

01:51.151 --> 01:54.253
...engineering centuries ahead
of their time?

01:59.323 --> 02:01.152
The answer?

02:02.327 --> 02:04.755
They reached past themselves...

02:05.791 --> 02:07.762
...and they touched the divine.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.399
Summoned the muse.

02:11.237 --> 02:13.701
Forged what is indeed
the greatest...

02:14.052 --> 02:16.659
...of the original
Seven Wonders of the World!

02:21.044 --> 02:23.905
Sorry. Somebody spill a mochaccino?

02:24.569 --> 02:26.615
Yeah, right over there.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.203
Thanks.

02:34.731 --> 02:38.196
Hey, Flynn, you wanna stop fricking posing
and join the rest of the students?

02:49.801 --> 02:51.052
Bravo!

02:51.836 --> 02:53.027
Well done!

02:55.927 --> 02:57.298
I want to thank...

02:57.645 --> 03:00.836
I want to thank you all
for a great semester.

03:04.377 --> 03:09.996
And despite what the naysayers
have been spouting...

03:10.499 --> 03:13.600
Yes. We will show, for the first time...

03:14.009 --> 03:17.271
...at perfect one-twentieth scale,
using real pyramid stones...

03:17.677 --> 03:19.451
...exactly what
the Great Pyramid looked like...

03:19.897 --> 03:22.185
...complete with its missing capstone.

03:22.887 --> 03:24.804
Right. Right.

03:25.286 --> 03:27.595
Let's go back to work, shall we?
Well done.

03:32.136 --> 03:33.727
- Professor.
- Yes?

03:34.020 --> 03:35.466
I've been doing some thinking.

03:35.789 --> 03:38.787
I think I might be more useful
managing the translation team.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.821
- Yes.
- They don't seem to grasp...

03:40.821 --> 03:42.294
Alas, Flynn...

03:42.700 --> 03:45.076
...you won't be continuing on
with the pyramid project.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.858
Sorry.

03:47.205 --> 03:48.583
But I'm your best student.

03:48.858 --> 03:52.309
That's the problem.
You are my best student.

03:52.638 --> 03:54.132
You are everyone's best student.

03:54.432 --> 03:56.392
You've never been anything
but the best student.

03:56.643 --> 03:59.253
Honestly, Flynn, I'd be doing you
a disservice to let you continue.

03:59.590 --> 04:01.246
Well, that's unfair and confusing...

04:01.532 --> 04:04.733
How many degrees
do you have in total, Flynn?

04:04.733 --> 04:07.223
- Not that many.
- I checked your transcript.

04:07.611 --> 04:09.370
You have 22.

04:09.741 --> 04:12.061
Professor, school is what I know.
It's what I'm good at.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.998
It's where I feel most like myself.

04:15.329 --> 04:18.211
You've been in this class
with these kids for three months now.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.964
Do you even know their names?

04:20.401 --> 04:22.214
- Of course I do.
- Oh, come on.

04:22.214 --> 04:24.470
That's insulting.
Okay, I don't know anybody's name.

04:24.470 --> 04:26.082
The reason is because
we all use nicknames.

04:26.082 --> 04:27.436
Yes.

04:27.875 --> 04:28.977
Hey.

04:29.293 --> 04:30.931
Sweater guy.

04:31.255 --> 04:33.211
Freak.

04:34.287 --> 04:36.533
Right back at you.

04:37.504 --> 04:39.499
You're a professional student, Flynn.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.548
You're avoiding life.

04:41.923 --> 04:44.926
This is a serious problem
that I will no longer enable.

04:45.257 --> 04:48.339
Professor, I have a very full life...

04:48.668 --> 04:50.109
Oh, come on, don't give me that.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.574
Have you ever been out of the city?

04:51.574 --> 04:54.024
When was the last time
you went dancing or to a ball game?

04:54.024 --> 04:55.805
Okay, wait a second now!

04:56.118 --> 04:59.503
- What is it exactly that you're doing...?
- You need to find a job, Flynn!

04:59.836 --> 05:01.931
To get some real-life experiences.

05:02.337 --> 05:05.548
Flynn, I've already spoken
with the administration.

05:05.924 --> 05:07.817
- And I have signed off on your degree here.
- No, no.

05:08.121 --> 05:09.765
Congratulations.

05:10.117 --> 05:12.585
- It's the middle of the semester!
- Yes, it is.

05:12.899 --> 05:15.279
- I can't sign up for a program for months.
- Exactly.

05:15.585 --> 05:17.638
No, no. Please, no. Don't.

05:17.945 --> 05:20.136
All I wanna do is learn.

05:20.468 --> 05:22.885
We never stop learning, Flynn. Never.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.424
It's only where we learn that changes.

05:25.724 --> 05:30.590
And it's about time you started doing it
in the big, bad real world.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.277
- Professor...
- Sink or swim, Flynn.

05:34.651 --> 05:36.866
- Professor...
- No, no, look ahead, that way.

05:37.342 --> 05:38.689
Come on.

05:38.985 --> 05:40.450
Good luck.

05:40.748 --> 05:42.412
Off you go.

06:14.230 --> 06:18.297
My brilliant boy has returned
from a long day of getting more brilliant.

06:18.653 --> 06:20.106
Mom, please.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.793
Not today.

06:27.947 --> 06:29.030
Come in.

06:32.519 --> 06:33.898
More books?

06:35.060 --> 06:37.016
These aren't just books.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.092
This is Aristotle. Voltaire. Jung.

06:43.325 --> 06:46.798
These books are slices
of the ultimate truth...

06:47.822 --> 06:50.304
...from the greatest thinkers of all time.

06:52.534 --> 06:54.303
And they speak to me.

06:54.687 --> 06:56.649
They speak to you?

06:57.421 --> 06:59.147
Like nothing else.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.814
Do they tell you to do bad things?

07:04.454 --> 07:07.754
- I'm going out.
- Do they tell you to set fires?

07:08.248 --> 07:10.728
Don't listen to the books
if they tell you to set fires...

07:11.165 --> 07:13.694
...or to hurt small animals.

07:14.084 --> 07:17.138
Wait. Wait.

07:17.598 --> 07:18.924
Where are you going?

07:19.284 --> 07:20.705
I'm going to the bookstore.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.576
Oh, good, she's here.

07:22.881 --> 07:25.055
- Who?
- She's a nice girl. You'll just say hello.

07:25.424 --> 07:28.854
And one more thing,
don't do what you always do.

07:30.577 --> 07:32.214
Come in. Come in.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.880
Debra, Flynn.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.764
Flynn, Debra.

07:39.052 --> 07:40.602
You two look great together.

07:43.752 --> 07:45.671
I'll leave you two kids alone.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.084
Would you like to sit down?

08:01.619 --> 08:04.095
- No, thanks. Carbs.
- No?

08:04.888 --> 08:07.931
- How did my mom...?
- Friends with my mom.

08:08.884 --> 08:11.678
They're so obsessed with
getting us into relationships.

08:12.186 --> 08:13.409
Yes, exactly.

08:13.719 --> 08:17.094
You'd think that we were just sitting
in our houses, locked in our rooms.

08:18.948 --> 08:21.405
I know, right? It's...

08:23.382 --> 08:25.423
So tell me, Debra, what do you do?

08:25.752 --> 08:27.341
I'm a social worker.

08:27.829 --> 08:29.296
Really?

08:29.650 --> 08:31.155
Oh, well, that's great.

08:31.546 --> 08:33.852
Do you work with kids
or old people or...?

08:34.190 --> 08:36.054
No, no. Convicted felons.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.938
Killers, mainly. What do you do?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.143
Actually...

08:41.551 --> 08:43.075
...I'm a student.

08:43.471 --> 08:46.818
You've been a college student
your entire...?

08:47.180 --> 08:49.133
- I like to learn. Is that a crime?
- No.

08:49.472 --> 08:52.502
I mean, so what? I've spent most,
if not all, of my adult life in school.

08:52.828 --> 08:55.207
Maybe I've missed out on
some "extracurricular" activities.

08:55.549 --> 08:57.979
- That doesn't make me a freak, does it?
- Of course not.

08:58.315 --> 09:00.398
- I understand.
- You do?

09:00.778 --> 09:02.794
Sure. You like to learn.

09:03.297 --> 09:06.403
- Yes.
- And you're in your 30s and still in school.

09:06.721 --> 09:08.363
- Exactly.
- And you live with your mother...

09:08.363 --> 09:10.117
...and you're okay with that.
- Yes.

09:10.469 --> 09:11.965
No. No.

09:12.324 --> 09:13.646
Wait.

09:14.905 --> 09:16.384
I have to change my life.

09:16.738 --> 09:19.115
- I would.
- Anyone thirsty?

09:19.466 --> 09:23.410
Yeah, I wish I could stay,
but I really have to get back to work.

09:23.723 --> 09:25.144
You're going?

09:25.697 --> 09:27.056
So soon?

09:27.344 --> 09:30.853
It was nice meeting you all.
I hope things work out for you.

09:30.853 --> 09:32.697
Thank you.

09:35.847 --> 09:39.856
Mom, can you please
not do that anymore?

09:40.209 --> 09:43.005
I just want my boy to find love.
Is that so terrible?

09:43.388 --> 09:44.691
I will.

09:45.406 --> 09:46.919
One day.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.816
When it's right.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.166
The things that make life worth living...

09:51.882 --> 09:55.566
...you know, they can't be thought here.

09:57.009 --> 10:00.406
They must be felt here.

10:04.660 --> 10:06.942
Maybe you don't know so much.

11:08.970 --> 11:13.085
<i>You have been selected to interview
for a prestigious position... </i>

11:13.415 --> 11:15.859
<i>... with the Metropolitan Public Library. </i>

11:17.924 --> 11:19.882
Now, how did you do that?

11:46.796 --> 11:48.849
How may I help you, sir?

12:07.217 --> 12:08.749
Next!

12:13.818 --> 12:15.265
Next!

12:28.529 --> 12:31.153
Next!

12:31.373 --> 12:33.567
I'm not... I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna...

12:35.206 --> 12:37.436
Where do you think you're going?

12:38.170 --> 12:40.146
Yes, you. Get in here.

13:17.505 --> 13:21.955
What makes you think
you could be the Librarian?

13:23.799 --> 13:25.592
Well, I've read a lot of books.

13:26.623 --> 13:28.092
Don't try to be funny.

13:28.430 --> 13:29.747
I don't do funny.

13:30.207 --> 13:31.635
I'm sorry.

13:35.365 --> 13:39.763
What makes you think
you could be the Librarian?

13:40.164 --> 13:42.485
I know the Dewey decimal system,
Library of Congress...

13:42.801 --> 13:45.767
...research paper orthodoxy, web searching.
I can set up an RSS feed.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.634
Everybody knows that.

13:47.929 --> 13:49.683
They're librarians.

13:50.015 --> 13:54.646
What makes you think
you're the Librarian?

13:56.265 --> 13:59.611
I know other stuff?

13:59.961 --> 14:01.441
Mr...

14:03.283 --> 14:04.946
..."Flynn Carsen"...

14:05.305 --> 14:07.130
...stop wasting my time.

14:07.464 --> 14:11.968
Tell me something you know that nobody
else who has walked in here could tell me.

14:22.364 --> 14:24.258
You have mononucleosis.

14:24.686 --> 14:27.482
Your marriage broke up two months ago,
you broke your nose when you were 4...

14:27.837 --> 14:29.825
...and you live with three cats.

14:30.489 --> 14:33.356
Is that what you had in mind?

14:34.292 --> 14:38.270
Swollen parajugular lymph nodes
and distended eyelids are clearly mono.

14:38.601 --> 14:42.075
It takes three months for an indentation
on the ring finger to completely disappear.

14:42.075 --> 14:43.970
Yours is approximately two-thirds gone.

14:44.279 --> 14:46.619
Your surgeon gave you
a terminus paralateral scar...

14:46.619 --> 14:49.175
...which is given to children
under the age of 6.

14:49.175 --> 14:51.775
And I can clearly see three
distinct types of cat hair.

14:51.775 --> 14:56.791
A white Himalayan, a tortoiseshell
and an orange-striped tabby.

14:58.849 --> 15:01.915
I didn't break my nose till I was 5.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.821
<i>What's more important than knowledge?</i>

15:07.929 --> 15:11.664
- Where did that come from?
- Just answer the question.

15:11.541 --> 15:13.616
More important than...

15:18.050 --> 15:22.968
The things that make life worth living
can't be thought here...

15:23.345 --> 15:26.524
...they must be felt here?

15:30.148 --> 15:32.885
The interviews are over.
Send everyone home.

15:36.582 --> 15:38.361
Not you.

15:38.720 --> 15:42.420
There will be a six-month trial period.
If you don't screw up...

15:42.811 --> 15:46.269
...then you will officially be the Librarian.

15:46.662 --> 15:50.391
Until then, if you are one minute late,
I will dock your pay.

15:50.807 --> 15:52.990
If you break anything,
I will dock your pay.

15:53.478 --> 15:56.088
- Got it?
- Yeah. Tell me what I said...

15:56.451 --> 15:59.548
...that was good so that I know
for the next time.

15:59.883 --> 16:01.364
<i>Mr. Carsen. </i>

16:01.665 --> 16:05.301
There isn't going to be a next time,
Mr. Carsen.

16:05.644 --> 16:09.182
You are about to begin a wondrous
adventure, from which...

16:09.504 --> 16:11.791
...you will never be the same.

16:13.134 --> 16:15.334
Welcome to the Library.

16:16.204 --> 16:18.635
I'll show you where you'll be working.

16:28.257 --> 16:32.525
I've never worked in a library before, but
isn't this a lot of security for some books?

16:33.014 --> 16:35.650
This is the most secure place in the world.

16:36.050 --> 16:38.052
Soon you'll see why.

16:44.989 --> 16:46.909
If we shadows have offended...

16:47.267 --> 16:48.704
...think but this...

16:49.077 --> 16:50.616
...and all is mended.

16:50.979 --> 16:52.883
That we have but slumber'd here...

16:53.249 --> 16:55.047
...whilst these visions did appear.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.732
- Very good.
- Shakespeare.

17:08.020 --> 17:10.023
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream. </i>

17:25.339 --> 17:28.337
Isn't that what the Army does
with nuclear weapons?

17:28.695 --> 17:30.601
Where do you think
the Army got the idea?

18:12.492 --> 18:17.208
You're about to see something that
few men in the world have ever seen.

18:53.959 --> 18:57.266
It's 2 and a half cubits in length.
Setim wood. Gold overlay.

18:59.883 --> 19:02.378
That is an exact replica
of the Ark of the Covenant.

19:02.759 --> 19:04.971
It's not a replica.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.617
Don't touch it or you'll be electrocuted.

19:10.985 --> 19:13.892
Or as they used to say, "smote down. "

19:17.528 --> 19:19.651
Am I on TV?

19:20.052 --> 19:23.092
Is this one of those
hidden-camera shows?

19:23.656 --> 19:26.704
Trust me, Flynn, this...
This is your destiny.

19:27.257 --> 19:30.535
You are now the guardian
of all these great treasures.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.927
We are very careful...

19:32.307 --> 19:34.716
...about who we allow
to be the Librarian.

19:56.619 --> 20:00.463
This box once belonged to a girl
named Pandora.

20:00.973 --> 20:02.840
She opened it one day...

20:03.715 --> 20:07.825
...and evil controlled the land
for 1000 years.

20:09.002 --> 20:13.055
So I think it's best not...
Not to repeat her mistake.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.895
This cannot actually be Excalibur.

20:23.283 --> 20:26.647
Only the worthy can release
the sword from the stone.

20:27.044 --> 20:29.311
- Try it.
- No, no, no.

20:29.789 --> 20:31.695
Not worthy, trust me.

20:32.088 --> 20:33.940
How do you know if you don't try it?

20:34.282 --> 20:37.737
Because I'm still not exactly sure
why it is that you chose me.

20:38.705 --> 20:42.320
We scour the educational system,
both public and private...

20:42.320 --> 20:43.955
...from a hundred countries.

20:43.955 --> 20:45.498
So there's a system.

20:45.498 --> 20:49.340
Oh, there's a system
for finding candidates.

20:49.754 --> 20:52.424
When it comes to choosing the Librarian...

20:52.928 --> 20:56.798
...well, that has an odd kind of way
of working itself out.

20:58.108 --> 21:00.780
Flynn, you've been studying all your life.

21:01.324 --> 21:03.110
This is why.

21:03.524 --> 21:05.887
Oh, I cannot wait to 
tell my mom about this.

21:05.887 --> 21:08.330
I mean, she is going to...

21:09.109 --> 21:11.783
You are now part
of a very special community.

21:12.167 --> 21:15.644
The secret of the Library has been kept
for thousands of years.

21:16.091 --> 21:19.387
The sword is floating.

21:19.769 --> 21:21.347
Neck.

21:21.668 --> 21:23.056
Help.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.602
You cannot tell anyone
anything about this.

21:26.960 --> 21:30.571
The Librarians are the only ones
who know that this even exists.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.994
Give Flynn some time.

21:35.405 --> 21:37.442
You'll like him.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.412
I got it, I got it, I got it!

22:32.766 --> 22:34.489
I believe in you, Flynn.

22:34.885 --> 22:38.367
I think there's a possibility
that you could be a great Librarian.

22:38.716 --> 22:43.361
As great as the...
As Eldred the Truly Wonderful.

22:46.332 --> 22:48.370
Eldred the Truly Wonderful.

22:49.014 --> 22:53.299
Well, I would settle for
Flynn the Not So Embarrassing.

22:54.031 --> 22:56.419
Flynn the Rather Pleasant at Parties.

22:59.431 --> 23:01.344
Edward Wilde.

23:01.653 --> 23:03.758
He... Oh, he must've been
the last Librarian.

23:04.084 --> 23:05.718
Yes. Yes, he was.

23:06.215 --> 23:08.014
God rest his soul.

23:47.131 --> 23:49.560
Everything went exactly as you said.

24:07.607 --> 24:08.782
7:01.

24:09.109 --> 24:11.390
You're late. You're gonna have to
dock your own pay.

24:14.116 --> 24:15.721
Coffee?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.798
Oh, I hate a kiss-ass.

24:24.323 --> 24:25.820
Why is this door open?

24:30.115 --> 24:31.462
Oh, my...

24:35.811 --> 24:37.469
I think he's up.

24:40.887 --> 24:42.430
The surveillance tape.

24:56.725 --> 24:58.913
They knew about the fail-safe.

24:59.451 --> 25:02.646
They only had time to take one item.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.003
They...

25:11.348 --> 25:13.173
...took the Spear of Destiny.

25:14.193 --> 25:16.491
Do you know about the Spear of Destiny?

25:18.087 --> 25:19.622
It's the spear that...

25:19.899 --> 25:22.647
...supposedly pierced the side
of Jesus on the cross.

25:23.811 --> 25:25.846
An ancient talisman reported
to have mystical powers.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.541
Whoever controls the Spear,
controls the fate of the...

25:29.408 --> 25:32.094
...world.
- For thousands of years...

25:32.428 --> 25:35.068
...whoever had the Spear,
from Charlemagne to Napoleon...

25:35.503 --> 25:38.804
...became the greatest conqueror
in the world.

25:40.261 --> 25:42.691
Well, that's just a fragment of the Spear.

25:45.812 --> 25:49.017
The Spear was too powerful
to remain intact.

25:49.419 --> 25:52.029
But since you can never
completely destroy the Spear...

25:52.437 --> 25:55.483
...the Librarian hundreds of years ago
broke it into three pieces...

25:55.826 --> 25:59.106
...and scattered the three pieces
in secret places around the world.

25:59.567 --> 26:02.305
Well, with the Spear all broken up...

26:02.653 --> 26:04.797
...it can't still be a threat, can it?

26:05.131 --> 26:07.305
Hitler had only one piece.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.752
One can only imagine how powerful
all three are.

26:20.408 --> 26:22.112
The Serpent Brotherhood.

26:22.578 --> 26:23.902
Serpent Brotherhood?

26:24.512 --> 26:27.436
They incited the riot that led
to the destruction of the first Library.

26:27.837 --> 26:29.809
Well, then we better call the police.

26:30.336 --> 26:32.852
Oh, yeah, call the police.

26:33.280 --> 26:38.127
Tell them about the Spear of Destiny,
the golden goose, the lost Ark.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.487
Enjoy your stay in the psych ward.

26:40.803 --> 26:42.495
I understand Thorazine
comes in vanilla now.

26:42.495 --> 26:43.555
Right.

26:43.927 --> 26:48.752
Nobody can understand the mysteries of the
Library tradition unless they experience it.

26:49.132 --> 26:52.838
You are the only one who can
bring the Spear piece back.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.596
No. No, no.

26:59.247 --> 27:01.085
There's gotta be somebody
more qualified.

27:01.561 --> 27:03.738
Flynn, you are the only one for the task.

27:04.296 --> 27:08.062
You are the only one on Earth
for the task.

27:08.589 --> 27:10.117
Look at it this way...

27:10.407 --> 27:12.838
...if you come back, you'll be a hero.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.391
Well, that sounds very...

27:16.001 --> 27:18.275
- If I come back?
- Things aren't as bad as they look.

27:18.611 --> 27:21.348
When she says, if I come back,
I'm hearing I'm not coming back.

27:21.716 --> 27:23.837
I don't wanna go if I can't come back.

27:24.215 --> 27:26.038
They didn't take the book.

27:26.333 --> 27:29.023
If you ever wanna hide something,
hide it in plain sight.

27:29.408 --> 27:33.854
This book contains all the clues you'll need
to locate the other two pieces of the Spear.

27:34.617 --> 27:36.893
The only thing that I know
for certain is that...

27:37.254 --> 27:41.714
...the second piece is somewhere
in the Amazon jungle.

27:42.058 --> 27:46.805
Well, good, that narrows it down
to about 3 million square miles.

27:47.258 --> 27:48.335
Okay.

27:48.688 --> 27:50.887
Time is money. Come on.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.838
- Is this the Language of the Birds?
- Yes.

27:55.223 --> 27:57.927
Mankind's universal language.

27:58.315 --> 28:02.244
That is, before God decided that man
should speak many tongues...

28:02.542 --> 28:04.927
...after the Tower of Babel.

28:05.342 --> 28:07.543
This has been a dead language
for thousands of years.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.350
There's nobody alive that
knows how to read it.

28:11.201 --> 28:13.554
So you better get cracking.

28:14.911 --> 28:19.437
Even with the Rosetta stone, it took
hundreds of Egyptologists 17 years...

28:19.783 --> 28:21.693
...to decipher the Egyptian hieroglyphics.

28:22.252 --> 28:24.585
Well, you have considerably less time.

28:25.127 --> 28:27.992
You know this is my first day,
and I don't even have a parking place.

28:28.422 --> 28:31.731
You should have a parking place before
you get assigned to fight an evil conspiracy.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.871
But just remember one thing,
the most valuable object in the world...

28:35.303 --> 28:37.559
...is not here in the Library.

28:38.253 --> 28:40.287
It's right here.

28:53.528 --> 28:56.824
The fate of the world is in my hands?

28:58.428 --> 29:00.406
That is just so...

29:02.046 --> 29:03.879
...sad.

29:10.568 --> 29:12.460
Oh, God, help us all.

29:32.424 --> 29:35.689
...and Indian and Hebrew.

29:36.390 --> 29:39.730
The genders are Sanskrit,
the phonemes are Etruscan, with certain...

29:40.110 --> 29:42.208
Certain semantic features of Víteliú.

29:42.941 --> 29:44.965
Sorry, I was just...

29:45.241 --> 29:47.553
...thinking out loud.

29:59.758 --> 30:04.099
It was sweet of you to let me watch from
the cockpit, but I think I should take my...

30:04.526 --> 30:07.819
I was hoping to have the aisle seat.

30:11.714 --> 30:13.356
One sec.

30:16.274 --> 30:18.508
I'll come visit later. I promise.

30:18.508 --> 30:19.970
Any time.

30:28.857 --> 30:32.686
Believe it or not,
this is actually my first plane flight.

30:33.092 --> 30:36.042
Let's stop for a moment and consider.

30:36.379 --> 30:39.790
I am way out of your league. Way out.

30:40.134 --> 30:42.312
If your league were to explode...

30:42.641 --> 30:45.488
...I wouldn't hear the sound
for another three days.

30:45.952 --> 30:49.628
So for everybody's sakes,
let's just enjoy a companionable silence.

31:32.745 --> 31:33.860
I did it.

31:34.167 --> 31:37.544
I did it. I just learned the...
I just learned the Language of the Birds.

31:38.765 --> 31:41.002
Didn't even have a Rosetta stone.
I just did it in...

31:41.561 --> 31:44.141
...seven hours and 26 minutes.

31:46.084 --> 31:49.464
Sorry, sorry.
Go back to being radiant.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.650
I'd love for you to join us in the cabin,
see the sunrise over the Amazon.

31:54.670 --> 31:56.570
Of course you would.

31:56.845 --> 31:58.789
I would...

32:01.965 --> 32:03.591
"Of course you would. "

32:04.656 --> 32:06.294
"Of course you would. "

32:06.979 --> 32:09.712
<i>We're at 11,000 feet
and starting our descent. </i>

32:12.314 --> 32:16.183
Excuse me. We have a problem.
Are you the air marshal?

32:16.805 --> 32:18.118
Yes, I am.

32:27.485 --> 32:29.050
That's the Librarian?

32:29.565 --> 32:31.235
Don't underestimate him.

32:36.952 --> 32:39.089
Sorry. I just need to get past you.
I need to use the bathroom.

32:40.227 --> 32:41.649
Hey.

32:42.132 --> 32:43.839
Hey.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.255
Again, not impressed.

32:57.889 --> 32:59.716
- Who are you?
- Would love to talk...

33:00.903 --> 33:03.668
...but really don't have the time.

33:08.442 --> 33:11.127
- Who are you?
- The woman who's trying to save your life.

33:12.043 --> 33:13.663
Get him! Get him!

33:15.561 --> 33:16.938
What are you doing?

33:18.060 --> 33:19.488
We're going out.

33:24.297 --> 33:26.425
Don't tell me you're afraid of heights!

33:26.839 --> 33:29.636
It's just that I know that the odds...

33:30.100 --> 33:35.399
...of an untrained guy like me
surviving a jump from 11,000 feet...

33:35.723 --> 33:38.696
...is 7-2 against.

33:40.257 --> 33:42.163
What are your odds now?

33:57.346 --> 34:01.538
He brilliantly lowers our expectations
and then jumps without a chute.

34:01.887 --> 34:03.710
Remarkable!

34:10.402 --> 34:11.708
Don't look down.

34:12.043 --> 34:13.579
I think I'm gonna be sick.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.856
Who in the hell are you?

34:21.190 --> 34:24.697
Don't get your knickers in a twist, Carsen.
Judson told me to look out for you.

34:25.984 --> 34:28.121
Well, Judson told me to trust no one.

34:28.501 --> 34:29.545
Oh, yeah?

34:30.004 --> 34:31.775
Well, I'm Nicole Noone.

34:32.514 --> 34:34.197
No one.

34:35.878 --> 34:37.511
Didn't they tell you to expect me?

34:37.882 --> 34:40.277
No. Nobody told me anything.

34:41.469 --> 34:43.366
I have no idea what I'm doing.

34:43.804 --> 34:45.317
Really?

34:45.645 --> 34:48.797
No, no calls. They'll use the signal
to triangulate our location.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.011
Well, that's against the law.

34:51.438 --> 34:55.141
They tried to kill you. You think they care
about breaking phone-tapping regulations?

34:55.297 --> 34:56.904
They didn't just try to kill me.

34:57.253 --> 35:00.232
They just wanted to inject me with sodium
pentothal so I'd tell them where I hid...

35:01.197 --> 35:03.577
...the book.
- Who'd have thunk it?

35:04.669 --> 35:06.956
You know, if you really wanna
hide something...

35:07.320 --> 35:09.114
...you do it in plain sight.

35:10.009 --> 35:11.882
How did you get that on the airplane?

35:12.166 --> 35:14.127
Where the hell are we?

35:15.413 --> 35:16.847
I have no idea.

35:17.404 --> 35:19.749
Well, you're the brains
of the operation. Figure it out.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.970
Oh, you think I can't?

35:22.648 --> 35:24.546
I could just climb that tree right there.

35:24.851 --> 35:27.428
In a matter of seconds, I can
tell us exactly where we are.

35:27.769 --> 35:30.324
Well, I'm not stopping you.

35:32.533 --> 35:34.189
That tree.

36:03.519 --> 36:05.177
Do you need a hand?

36:07.174 --> 36:08.328
I'm fine.

36:15.621 --> 36:17.425
You go get them, monkey boy.

36:44.101 --> 36:45.869
Let's hear it, genius.

36:48.582 --> 36:49.973
All right.

36:53.379 --> 36:54.676
Okay.

36:55.055 --> 36:56.558
Well...

36:59.686 --> 37:01.085
That...

37:01.445 --> 37:03.464
...is an extremely rare blue condor.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.871
Found only within a 100-mile radius
of the Amazon's Purus tributary.

37:08.772 --> 37:11.089
The only mountain tall enough
to have a snowcap...

37:11.409 --> 37:13.749
...this time of year in that radius
is Mount Pôrto Velho.

37:14.205 --> 37:19.691
We are at minus 5.2 degrees latitude
and minus 64.6 degrees longitude.

37:20.083 --> 37:21.482
English?

37:21.801 --> 37:23.660
We need to go 24.7 miles...

37:23.987 --> 37:25.930
...that way.

37:30.305 --> 37:31.744
Isn't this...?

37:39.682 --> 37:42.488
- You always travel with a machete?
- I'm well-prepared.

37:42.919 --> 37:46.485
- That, or maybe you're a violent sociopath.
- You say the sweetest things.

37:46.871 --> 37:50.564
How many miles have we walked anyway?
Five? Ten?

37:50.935 --> 37:52.882
- Maybe one.
- Hello.

37:53.378 --> 37:57.105
Another person here.
A little consideration, please.

38:01.107 --> 38:02.850
Hey.

38:03.235 --> 38:05.508
Unknown plant phylum.

38:07.436 --> 38:08.648
I can't believe it.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.235
If you're nice, I'll name it after you.

38:11.657 --> 38:14.163
Be still, my heart.

38:14.505 --> 38:16.566
<i>Ficus narcissus.</i>

38:18.159 --> 38:19.558
Hey.

38:20.007 --> 38:22.792
You're supposed to be
the best tracker in the Amazon.

38:23.297 --> 38:25.132
Get tracking.

38:37.533 --> 38:40.528
See, anything is possible
in the world of books.

38:40.887 --> 38:42.768
I guess that makes me a dreamer.

38:43.102 --> 38:45.313
My mother said that my father
was a dreamer.

38:46.479 --> 38:48.563
He died when I was little.

38:48.927 --> 38:53.172
I guess I've subconsciously tried
to make up for his absence by...

38:53.866 --> 38:55.066
Hey.

38:55.481 --> 38:58.144
By behaving like him as
much as I possibly could.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.489
I can't believe I never made
that realization before.

39:02.959 --> 39:05.177
Sorry, did you say something, cupcake?

39:05.467 --> 39:09.511
I figure that since we're gonna be spending
so much time together, we might as well...

39:10.043 --> 39:12.195
...get to know each other a little bit.

39:12.589 --> 39:14.352
You seem like the observant type.

39:14.677 --> 39:16.051
I like to think so.

39:16.419 --> 39:20.249
Then you must've observed that I'm not the
type who's suddenly gonna open up to you.

39:20.561 --> 39:22.911
How long have you worked
for the Library?

39:23.208 --> 39:25.292
And yet you keep trying.

39:25.569 --> 39:28.342
I just want to get to know the Nicole
below the surface arrogance.

39:28.636 --> 39:30.816
Peel back the layers.

39:31.317 --> 39:33.814
What do you think's below
the surface arrogance?

39:34.228 --> 39:35.530
More arrogance.

39:35.837 --> 39:38.876
And then perhaps a few
delicious layers of flaky disdain...

39:39.153 --> 39:42.330
...all around a creamy sweet
center of homicidal rage.

39:42.641 --> 39:45.737
What do I have to do
to get you to shut up?

39:46.046 --> 39:48.570
Okay, I won't ask you
any more questions.

39:51.907 --> 39:53.923
So how long have you
worked for the Library?

39:55.625 --> 39:57.789
- Five years.
- Well, do these...

39:58.084 --> 40:01.524
...jumping-out-of-airplane-jungle-adventure
things happen to you often?

40:01.886 --> 40:05.159
What happened to the last Librarian?

40:05.600 --> 40:08.806
You don't need to know about me.
I don't need to know about you.

40:09.077 --> 40:11.642
We just need to work together.

40:11.918 --> 40:13.893
So...

40:14.227 --> 40:16.131
...nothing good, then.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.646
It's the only way across.

40:39.625 --> 40:41.214
There is no way.

40:41.762 --> 40:43.355
Look.

40:43.725 --> 40:46.269
The support beams, they're decomposed.
This wood is completely rotted.

40:46.608 --> 40:49.204
There is no way that this bridge
can structurally support our weight.

40:53.020 --> 40:54.383
Nicole.

40:55.289 --> 40:57.076
Nicole!

40:58.300 --> 40:59.988
Take a chance, big boy.

41:12.758 --> 41:14.438
Don't look down.

41:17.647 --> 41:18.930
Why?

41:19.284 --> 41:20.728
Why do I always do that?

41:21.019 --> 41:23.511
Focus on something else.
You must have a girlfriend, right?

41:23.862 --> 41:28.691
Big glasses, dirndl skirt? Makes you
watch a lot of subtitled documentaries.

41:30.830 --> 41:33.710
- I'm between girlfriends at the moment.
- I had the feeling.

41:36.039 --> 41:38.837
Have you figured out exactly
where the second piece is yet?

41:40.143 --> 41:42.926
You know, most of the clues
are pretty self-explanatory.

41:44.356 --> 41:46.113
Except for this one.

41:46.580 --> 41:48.173
To get inside...

41:50.193 --> 41:54.685
...you must know the time it takes
a bird to become a bird again.

41:55.100 --> 41:56.843
Any idea what that means?

41:57.259 --> 41:59.694
You, brains. Me, brawn.

42:00.692 --> 42:03.366
I cannot believe that I was wrong
about this bridge.

42:03.715 --> 42:05.905
I really didn't think that this
would support our...

42:06.550 --> 42:08.121
Flynn!

42:09.145 --> 42:11.177
Flynn! Flynn!

42:12.052 --> 42:13.677
Take my hand!

42:14.007 --> 42:16.596
Reach. Reach for my hand!

42:17.245 --> 42:18.744
Come on, that's it.

42:19.409 --> 42:21.138
Keep coming.

42:21.439 --> 42:22.876
That's it, come on.

42:23.167 --> 42:25.315
Keep reaching. There you go.

42:25.651 --> 42:27.236
Well, I hope you're having fun.

42:27.574 --> 42:29.111
Actually, I am.

42:33.297 --> 42:34.709
That wasn't so bad, was it?

42:39.875 --> 42:41.368
- Run!
- I told you!

42:41.712 --> 42:43.672
I told you this bridge couldn't
support our weight!

42:44.511 --> 42:46.380
Less talk! More running!

42:46.788 --> 42:48.417
Jump!

43:01.764 --> 43:03.431
So, what do you do for fun?

43:04.892 --> 43:08.050
I can kill a man 57 different ways.

43:08.436 --> 43:13.127
That's good. Let that out, that sensitive
soul inside of you that's yearning to be free.

43:13.506 --> 43:18.210
You may know everything in the world, but
you have no idea what sets my soul free.

43:19.122 --> 43:20.733
Really?

43:42.647 --> 43:44.584
To get inside...

43:44.996 --> 43:48.236
...you must know the time it takes
a bird to become a bird again.

43:50.812 --> 43:54.144
Time it takes a bird to become a bird again.
Bird, bird, bird.

43:54.539 --> 43:57.205
That's gotta be some kind of metaphor.

43:57.945 --> 44:02.307
Usually the bird stands for reaching
some sort of unattainable height...

44:02.633 --> 44:04.306
...like a mountain or...

44:06.603 --> 44:11.684
I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was.

44:12.163 --> 44:16.468
Nobody talks about the Librarian like that.
Not even the Librarian.

44:21.134 --> 44:23.050
Okay.

44:24.120 --> 44:28.176
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any toilet paper anywhere...

44:28.533 --> 44:31.816
...on your body, would you?

44:32.270 --> 44:35.475
Knock yourself out.

44:43.834 --> 44:46.273
Nicole. Come here.

44:49.783 --> 44:52.378
- Serpent Brotherhood.
- Do you think they saw us?

44:52.813 --> 44:56.057
- No, but just to be safe...
- Should we go, or are we staying?

44:56.431 --> 44:59.318
They wouldn't dare make
that climb till morning.

44:59.734 --> 45:02.153
You can go to the bathroom.

45:02.452 --> 45:04.569
Lost the urge.

45:11.631 --> 45:13.864
Chilly without that fire.

45:14.812 --> 45:17.315
Wind-chill factor.

45:19.693 --> 45:21.063
Yeah.

45:21.426 --> 45:24.591
We're gonna have to do something
pretty desperate to keep warm.

45:24.908 --> 45:29.510
This is where you tell me the only way we'll
survive is if we huddle together for warmth.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.381
Well, if you insist.

45:31.786 --> 45:35.547
- Body warmth only. Got it?
- Got it.

45:40.736 --> 45:43.209
That's Sheliak...

45:44.012 --> 45:47.390
...and Terebellum, Cassiopeia.

45:47.751 --> 45:50.321
Don't tell me you memorized
the universe.

45:50.642 --> 45:53.224
Well, the known universe.

45:57.223 --> 45:58.387
Nicole.

46:00.509 --> 46:03.486
What happened to the last Librarian?

46:05.441 --> 46:07.352
He died.

46:07.828 --> 46:09.339
End of story.

46:09.654 --> 46:13.067
- I'm no good at remembering details.
- You're the type that remembers everything.

46:13.402 --> 46:14.684
You don't know anything about me.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.682
You're the youngest of three siblings
and the only girl.

46:18.031 --> 46:21.700
Your mother's English, your father's South
American, Argentinean, but you never...

46:22.578 --> 46:25.364
You never bothered to learn Spanish.

46:26.327 --> 46:28.192
You never had any pets.

46:28.554 --> 46:31.228
Your favorite stone is jade.

46:33.803 --> 46:39.756
And you wish more than anything that
you could forget half of what you've seen.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.925
But you can't.

46:47.579 --> 46:50.712
- Well, I could do the same thing about you.
- Be my guest.

46:54.261 --> 46:56.349
Nerd.

47:03.657 --> 47:05.790
Fair enough.

47:09.926 --> 47:12.082
The last Librarian...

47:13.550 --> 47:15.698
...Edward Wilde.

47:17.745 --> 47:21.614
Edward was charming.

47:22.283 --> 47:23.973
Handsome.

47:24.310 --> 47:26.631
Absolutely brilliant.

47:27.043 --> 47:29.615
We spent two years working together.

47:30.003 --> 47:33.119
Two incredible years.

47:34.905 --> 47:37.620
But he wasn't just smart.

47:37.965 --> 47:41.636
He was generous, kind.

47:42.087 --> 47:44.446
He could look into your eyes...

47:44.760 --> 47:47.886
...and see right into your soul.

47:48.685 --> 47:53.480
And I did the one thing I'm
not supposed to do on this job.

47:55.019 --> 47:57.475
I fell in love with him.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.866
And because of that, he's dead.

48:01.198 --> 48:03.508
We were in the Antarctic.

48:03.808 --> 48:06.156
We were sleeping in an igloo
that he built.

48:06.456 --> 48:08.436
When I woke up in the morning,
he wasn't there.

48:08.714 --> 48:12.379
And I ran outside just in time to
see the Serpent Brotherhood...

48:12.649 --> 48:14.884
...cutting off his head.

48:15.188 --> 48:17.104
I had one job...

48:17.414 --> 48:20.280
...protect the Librarian, and I failed.

48:27.271 --> 48:29.356
We're surrounded.

48:29.845 --> 48:32.261
I don't see anybody.

48:32.718 --> 48:35.114
Oh, them.

48:37.530 --> 48:40.845
- Talk to them. What are they speaking?
- I can't quite make out their dialect.

48:41.260 --> 48:43.394
It has elements of Kugapakori...

48:43.722 --> 48:46.321
...the syntax of the Yanomamis,
maybe even the Amahuacas.

48:47.046 --> 48:48.980
You push me one more time with that...

48:49.373 --> 48:51.383
Don't piss them off.
That's not a good idea.

49:29.519 --> 49:32.408
It was just Portuguese.
I was overthinking it.

49:44.345 --> 49:46.803
Oh, they're doing a mongo dance.

49:47.166 --> 49:50.448
I did a master's thesis
on native mating rituals.

49:50.758 --> 49:53.084
This is a huge honor for us.

50:17.010 --> 50:18.689
Flynn?

50:20.614 --> 50:23.324
Where's the funny guy I was with?

50:43.418 --> 50:46.083
They are here.

50:56.427 --> 50:57.925
Flynn!

51:00.237 --> 51:02.023
Move. Come on.

51:06.441 --> 51:09.037
Move! This way, through the hut.
The book!

51:09.597 --> 51:11.544
I know, I know. I got it, I got it.

51:12.883 --> 51:14.729
They're right behind us. Move.

51:23.007 --> 51:25.292
Flynn, run.

51:29.932 --> 51:31.393
They're right behind us.

51:35.068 --> 51:38.108
- Flynn, come on, stop looking back. Move.
- Nicole, wait.

51:38.486 --> 51:41.466
Bad guys chasing behind us.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.797
Don't ever leave my sight again,
understand?

51:51.138 --> 51:53.719
What is this, Slap the Librarian Day?

51:54.272 --> 51:58.368
Oh, I get it, you're just being professional.
It isn't as if you genuinely care for me.

51:58.817 --> 52:00.497
Shut up.

52:00.851 --> 52:03.622
Why are you smiling?
I don't like it when you smile.

52:03.622 --> 52:05.815
That means you're about
to do something dangerous.

52:06.157 --> 52:08.945
Oh, you know me so well.
Don't look down.

52:16.221 --> 52:17.851
Did you see that?

52:18.175 --> 52:20.057
That Librarian is incredible.

52:23.152 --> 52:24.170
Flynn.

52:25.363 --> 52:27.159
Flynn, take my hand.

52:31.066 --> 52:32.927
- Nicole!
- Come on!

52:33.361 --> 52:34.838
Flynn!

52:42.043 --> 52:43.359
Flynn!

52:46.222 --> 52:48.807
- Nicole. Nicole.
- I got you.

52:54.185 --> 52:57.908
According to the book, we take this river
and follow the sun until it ends.

53:05.269 --> 53:08.377
And I do believe the sun has ended.

53:26.068 --> 53:28.132
All right. Now we're close.

53:28.557 --> 53:30.271
All we have to do...

53:31.454 --> 53:33.670
...is walk the circumference
of the Earth...

53:33.989 --> 53:36.799
...divided by the length
of the Fortress of Ollantaytambo.

53:37.155 --> 53:40.732
Oh, yeah? And how the hell
are we gonna figure that out?

53:41.048 --> 53:43.286
Seven hundred and ninety-two yards.

53:43.578 --> 53:44.979
That way.

53:45.452 --> 53:49.882
One, two, three, four.

53:50.794 --> 53:52.193
Five, six.

53:53.102 --> 53:56.712
Seven hundred and ninety, 791, 792.

53:59.792 --> 54:02.564
Well, there's nothing.
You must have got something wrong.

54:03.366 --> 54:05.562
I don't get facts wrong.

54:06.771 --> 54:09.270
It's everything else I screw up.

54:15.484 --> 54:17.618
When the Toltecs invaded Chichén Itzá...

54:17.944 --> 54:20.610
...it was rumored
that a group of Mayan priests...

54:20.928 --> 54:23.473
...fled Mexico with their entire treasury.

54:23.805 --> 54:25.583
As the story goes...

54:25.926 --> 54:30.029
...they built a Mayan temple deep
in the Amazon jungle to hide the treasure...

54:32.034 --> 54:35.177
...never to be heard from again.

54:41.142 --> 54:44.221
So how do we get inside, genius?

54:44.736 --> 54:47.258
Those are Mayan numbers.

54:49.593 --> 54:51.830
Mayan priests were obsessed
with numbers.

54:51.830 --> 54:55.781
- Oh, you'd fit right in.
- The time it takes a bird to become a bird.

54:56.106 --> 54:59.813
To get inside you must know the time
it takes a bird to become a bird again.

55:01.444 --> 55:05.060
- The procession.
- Yay! What is that?

55:05.439 --> 55:08.855
The time it takes the constellations,
what Mayans called "birds of heaven"...

55:09.152 --> 55:13.070
...to make a complete revolution
around the galaxy, 25,765 years.

55:13.459 --> 55:16.189
The Mayans were the first to discover it.

55:17.009 --> 55:18.759
All right.

55:19.543 --> 55:21.449
Twenty-five thousand.

55:26.472 --> 55:28.454
Seven hundred.

55:31.583 --> 55:33.431
Sixty-five.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.300
Watch out!

56:09.008 --> 56:10.735
Where are we?

56:11.692 --> 56:13.773
I am not sure.

56:22.339 --> 56:24.869
We are in a Mayan death chamber.

56:25.300 --> 56:29.046
Escape is granted only to those
who can solve the secret of the room.

56:30.452 --> 56:32.383
Yep.

56:32.895 --> 56:35.120
The only way out...

56:35.401 --> 56:37.843
...is that doorway on the other side.

56:38.182 --> 56:42.283
Okay, so how do we get to that door?

56:43.186 --> 56:45.611
That's the secret.

56:55.512 --> 56:57.300
That's not good.

56:57.659 --> 57:00.242
We have to find a way to get
to that doorway on the other side...

57:00.242 --> 57:02.332
...before the wall pushes us
into the abyss.

57:02.332 --> 57:03.983
- Oh, really?
- Yep.

57:03.983 --> 57:07.094
- Any clues in that book of yours?
- No, no.

57:07.915 --> 57:10.566
- Okay, we're on our own.
- So now what?

57:11.127 --> 57:12.606
I'm not sure.

57:13.001 --> 57:15.629
Now would be a damn good time
to come up with something brilliant.

57:15.970 --> 57:18.421
"Sure, Flynn, just figure it out.
That's why you're on the mission. "

57:18.747 --> 57:21.488
Focus. Big mission. Fate of the world.

57:23.973 --> 57:27.523
- Nothing's coming to me.
- Great. Choking, just like I knew you would.

57:27.956 --> 57:30.844
Hey. Oh, I get it, reverse psychology.

57:31.191 --> 57:32.852
- Good.
- No, not reverse psychology.

57:33.108 --> 57:34.952
- Anger, annoyance.
- Okay, I got it.

57:35.266 --> 57:37.784
This is an exact replica
of their Great Temple of Teotihuacán.

57:38.095 --> 57:40.554
<i>Three hundred quahuitls by 20 quahuitls.</i>

57:40.821 --> 57:43.437
There is a place in this chamber
where all priests...

57:43.744 --> 57:47.490
...could receive salvation no matter what,
and that place would be...

57:49.230 --> 57:50.831
...there?

57:51.250 --> 57:52.936
That's midair, Sherlock.

57:54.351 --> 57:55.894
You trust me?

57:59.298 --> 58:00.670
You only live once.

58:01.019 --> 58:03.191
- Unless you believe in Buddhism or Sikhism.
- I hate you.

58:04.328 --> 58:05.363
Well...

58:15.777 --> 58:18.076
Optical illusion. Mirrors.

58:18.417 --> 58:22.930
The Mayans were the first tribe
in the Americas to use them.

58:23.840 --> 58:25.088
Good.

58:54.873 --> 58:56.443
There it is.

58:56.887 --> 58:58.897
- There's the second piece.
- No.

59:07.685 --> 59:10.027
Well, it's an exact rhythm.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.104
One, two, three. One, two, three.

59:14.669 --> 59:18.189
- Why does that sound so familiar?
- It's called a waltz.

59:18.896 --> 59:21.103
We have to dance our way
to the treasure.

59:23.254 --> 59:27.092
I broke every toe of every girl
that I danced with at my high school prom.

59:27.495 --> 59:29.665
Even my mother wouldn't dance with me.

59:29.946 --> 59:32.939
- You took your mother to the high school...?
- All right, all right. Don't start.

59:33.291 --> 59:37.176
Come on, we'll do it together.
It's easy. It's all in the hips and the butt.

59:38.346 --> 59:41.526
One, two, three. One, two, three.
One, two, three.

59:41.795 --> 59:42.940
- No, no.
- What?

59:43.241 --> 59:46.077
- Not yet. Not ready yet.
- One, two, three. One, two, three.

59:47.241 --> 59:49.671
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

59:49.984 --> 59:52.549
- One, two, three. One, two, three.
- One, two, three. One, two, three.

01:00:06.386 --> 01:00:09.189
- Shouldn't I be the one dipping you?
- Technically.

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:39.097
You better have a damn good reason
for doing that.

01:00:39.514 --> 01:00:42.189
Yeah, well, these things
are always booby-trapped.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:22.180
This means that all biblical history
has to be reevaluated.

01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:25.433
Why don't you get
the last piece of the Spear...

01:01:25.763 --> 01:01:29.231
...and then you and Judson can have
a lovely long chat in Aramaic...

01:01:29.697 --> 01:01:32.381
...about all the history stuff
while I take a shower.

01:01:32.711 --> 01:01:35.051
I believe the phrase is "hands up. "

01:01:37.347 --> 01:01:39.188
Up.

01:01:46.683 --> 01:01:49.687
I really admire your work.

01:02:11.507 --> 01:02:13.954
I knew you'd bring me the piece, Nicole.

01:02:15.867 --> 01:02:18.509
- Edward?
- You're the last Librarian.

01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:21.053
Wait a minute.

01:02:21.444 --> 01:02:24.571
- You're dead.
- And yet, here I stand.

01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:28.943
- I saw you die.
- You saw an elaborate special effect.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:32.784
Your tears were perfect.
I couldn't have planned it better myself.

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:36.591
So they really didn't cut off your head.

01:02:37.118 --> 01:02:39.255
You're the Librarian?

01:02:39.818 --> 01:02:41.628
But why?

01:02:41.953 --> 01:02:45.188
Absolute power
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

01:02:45.749 --> 01:02:49.761
You remember how I loved
a good aphrodisiac.

01:02:50.417 --> 01:02:52.825
I'll kill you, you bastard.

01:02:57.123 --> 01:03:00.777
Goodbye, Nicole.
It really was nice to see you again.

01:03:05.176 --> 01:03:07.053
- You can't kill her.
- Why not?

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.233
Because you need me
to find the last piece.

01:03:10.581 --> 01:03:13.822
And I won't do it without her.

01:03:16.739 --> 01:03:18.761
I don't need you.

01:03:19.645 --> 01:03:22.396
I have this.

01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:32.343
The Language of the Birds.

01:03:33.498 --> 01:03:35.600
Nobody can read this.

01:03:35.949 --> 01:03:38.729
Nobody except a real Librarian.

01:03:44.473 --> 01:03:47.415
In the Language of the Birds,
that means you're up the creek...

01:03:47.745 --> 01:03:50.133
...and I've got the only paddle.

01:03:51.524 --> 01:03:54.038
Tell me where the piece is,
and I'll let her live.

01:03:54.386 --> 01:03:56.543
- Don't tell him.
- It's in Shangri-la.

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.804
Don't screw with me. That's a legend.

01:03:59.123 --> 01:04:02.204
Shangri-la is in Mount Kailas.

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.884
- In the Himalayas.
- Idiot.

01:04:05.166 --> 01:04:07.176
Excuse me for trying
to save your life again.

01:04:07.524 --> 01:04:10.160
The Spear is more important than my life.

01:04:10.482 --> 01:04:13.713
He's not gonna get
anywhere near that spear.

01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:18.136
Unless I interpret the clues in that book.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:44.304
That's Mount Kailas.

01:04:44.778 --> 01:04:46.718
Where's your Shangri-la?

01:04:47.038 --> 01:04:50.125
We can't find it from the air.
All the clues are on the ground.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:58.020
Lars, we're gonna have to climb.
Get ready to take her down.

01:04:59.474 --> 01:05:01.906
At least you didn't fail at your job.

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:04.870
He's still alive.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:08.853
No, he just faked his own death...

01:05:09.177 --> 01:05:12.180
...and became head of the very
evil organization we've been fighting.

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:14.675
That's much better.

01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:08.423
It's this way.

01:06:17.584 --> 01:06:19.962
Flynn! No!

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:24.386
I got you.

01:06:26.555 --> 01:06:27.799
Hold on.

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.498
Nicole.

01:06:33.963 --> 01:06:35.347
Come on.

01:06:44.423 --> 01:06:46.356
Not on my watch.

01:06:57.974 --> 01:07:00.912
You're leading me on a wild-goose chase.

01:07:07.362 --> 01:07:09.711
I should kill you myself.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:15.909
Welcome.

01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:18.969
It's been long prophesied
that you would come today.

01:08:20.573 --> 01:08:22.688
We want the Spear piece.

01:08:36.442 --> 01:08:38.161
It is hidden inside.

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:40.304
Open it.

01:08:40.662 --> 01:08:42.573
We are the mere keepers.

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:45.502
We have no idea how to open it.

01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:49.277
Well, fortunately, he does.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.761
Get the Spear piece,
or I blow her brains out.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:16.716
- Oh, this can't be right.
- What?

01:09:17.124 --> 01:09:20.207
Well, it says that this
can only be opened...

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:22.662
...with the name of God.
- So?

01:09:22.983 --> 01:09:26.035
So the name of God
is only the biggest secret in the world.

01:09:26.372 --> 01:09:29.984
For 4000 years people have tried to find it.
You want me to do it in 15 seconds?

01:09:48.911 --> 01:09:50.926
M- E.

01:10:01.514 --> 01:10:03.208
Me.

01:10:05.078 --> 01:10:06.945
God is within us all.

01:10:20.833 --> 01:10:23.455
Go ahead, take it.

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:33.205
No.

01:10:34.922 --> 01:10:36.196
No.

01:10:36.615 --> 01:10:38.451
You take it.

01:10:50.432 --> 01:10:52.334
Problem?

01:10:53.725 --> 01:10:55.226
No.

01:11:07.145 --> 01:11:08.722
Lars, fly up here now.

01:11:09.094 --> 01:11:11.052
Track my signal.

01:11:12.162 --> 01:11:13.959
It's about time.

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:31.016
I want the Spear piece, Nicole.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:34.343
A man in hell wants ice water.
Doesn't mean he's gonna get it.

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:36.486
No.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.629
Wait. Get back. Get the Spear.
Get the Spear.

01:11:42.266 --> 01:11:44.183
Hold on. We have to get the Spear piece.

01:11:44.869 --> 01:11:46.926
Wanna hide something,
do it in plain sight.

01:11:48.259 --> 01:11:51.743
Guard it well. The Spear opens a door
that must be kept closed.

01:12:05.269 --> 01:12:07.454
<i>- Mr. Carsen. 
- Hey.</i>

01:12:07.825 --> 01:12:08.984
Judson.

01:12:09.343 --> 01:12:11.784
You and everyone at the Library
can completely relax.

01:12:12.101 --> 01:12:15.089
We have the third piece of the Spear,
and it is right...

01:12:19.644 --> 01:12:21.492
Right here. Completely safe.

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:26.194
<i>Good work. I still can't believe
that Wilde joined the Serpent Brotherhood. </i>

01:12:26.585 --> 01:12:28.490
<i>He was a fine Librarian. </i>

01:12:28.808 --> 01:12:30.841
<i>Thank goodness we have a... </i>

01:12:31.564 --> 01:12:33.418
<i>A better one now. </i>

01:12:33.691 --> 01:12:35.968
<i>You better get the door. </i>

01:12:39.362 --> 01:12:42.453
Someday he's gonna have to tell me
how he does that.

01:12:53.405 --> 01:12:58.002
Excuse me, but I didn't
order any champagne.

01:13:02.135 --> 01:13:04.038
But I did.

01:13:55.407 --> 01:13:58.869
What's the matter? Haven't you guys
seen a naked guy in a sheet before?

01:13:59.256 --> 01:14:01.590
<i>Is something wrong, Flynn?</i>

01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:04.202
Nicole is missing,
and so is the Spear.

01:14:04.538 --> 01:14:06.388
Serpent Brotherhood
may have taken her, or...

01:14:06.703 --> 01:14:07.687
<i>Or... </i>

01:14:07.989 --> 01:14:10.647
She may have been in cahoots
with Wilde all along.

01:14:10.922 --> 01:14:12.765
Cahoots.

01:14:13.035 --> 01:14:14.719
I've been cahooted.

01:14:15.027 --> 01:14:16.682
<i>All right, all right, all is not lost. </i>

01:14:16.983 --> 01:14:19.651
<i>It took a great power
to sunder the Spear. </i>

01:14:19.943 --> 01:14:22.790
<i>It'll take even more
to fuse the pieces together again. </i>

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.562
How much?

01:14:24.862 --> 01:14:27.428
<i>Strip the mysticism aside,
and you'll need a...</i>

01:14:27.749 --> 01:14:32.656
<i>A local electromagnetic field
registering over 15 on the... </i>

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.901
<i>On the Schumm scale. </i>

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.569
Okay. Good.

01:14:37.889 --> 01:14:40.304
Only time energy like that's
been registered...

01:14:40.616 --> 01:14:43.617
...was during a peak full moon at
the Great Pyramid when it had its capstone.

01:14:43.899 --> 01:14:46.525
And the Egyptian government
refuses to replace...

01:14:47.299 --> 01:14:50.135
...the capstone.

01:14:51.411 --> 01:14:53.985
The next peak full moon
is tomorrow night.

01:14:54.279 --> 01:14:56.405
Call the Marines, Judson.

01:14:56.735 --> 01:14:58.970
I'm coming home.

01:15:04.537 --> 01:15:06.865
Clothes. I need the clothes.

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:25.307
Flynn.

01:15:25.678 --> 01:15:28.227
We can get in
through the ventilation system.

01:15:30.463 --> 01:15:32.285
Where are the Marines?

01:15:32.719 --> 01:15:35.063
Semper fi.

01:15:35.937 --> 01:15:38.115
You were a Marine?

01:15:38.436 --> 01:15:40.050
Good. Wonderful.

01:15:40.407 --> 01:15:43.049
Well, now, let's...
Let's get that spear back.

01:16:00.003 --> 01:16:01.463
Well, well.

01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:03.878
Professor Harris.

01:16:04.211 --> 01:16:06.052
I should've known he was evil.

01:16:06.389 --> 01:16:08.850
He gave me an A-minus.

01:16:19.672 --> 01:16:23.902
Serpent Brothers,
our dream comes true tonight.

01:16:26.893 --> 01:16:29.048
Doesn't that guy ever die?

01:16:31.604 --> 01:16:33.611
There doesn't seem
to be much...

01:16:33.983 --> 01:16:36.432
...cahooting going on now.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:39.428
We call down the power
of the gods.

01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:41.870
The ancient ones.

01:17:06.191 --> 01:17:08.366
<i>Snake! Snake!</i>

01:17:08.954 --> 01:17:10.895
<i>Snake! Snake!</i>

01:17:11.234 --> 01:17:12.775
Come on.

01:17:24.767 --> 01:17:26.156
This house...

01:17:26.499 --> 01:17:28.855
...a gateway to eternal life.

01:17:29.259 --> 01:17:30.950
This weapon...

01:17:31.276 --> 01:17:34.035
...with the blood of one
who defied death.

01:17:34.527 --> 01:17:39.040
I claim power of life and death.

01:18:02.523 --> 01:18:03.802
I can't do this alone.

01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:05.923
Well, you got me, you know?

01:18:06.258 --> 01:18:08.528
Well, no offense, Judson, but you're...

01:18:09.756 --> 01:18:11.476
A bad mother.

01:18:11.811 --> 01:18:13.900
Well, I was a Librarian too, you know.

01:18:29.027 --> 01:18:30.425
Oh, yes.

01:18:31.466 --> 01:18:33.548
I feel the power.

01:18:34.766 --> 01:18:36.776
The power of life.

01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:39.979
And the power of death!

01:19:27.616 --> 01:19:29.579
At last, Nicole...

01:19:29.956 --> 01:19:31.934
...we can be one.

01:19:43.264 --> 01:19:45.300
Kill them.

01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:55.023
Houdini, Prague, 1926.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.713
We have to get the Spear
back to the Library.

01:20:09.788 --> 01:20:11.282
Get the Spear away from Wilde.

01:20:11.646 --> 01:20:13.535
Before he gets too powerful.

01:20:21.186 --> 01:20:22.885
There's no way I'm going
to let you...

01:20:25.182 --> 01:20:27.290
You broke my nose.
How dare you, Flynn.

01:20:27.732 --> 01:20:31.515
Yeah, I did what you said, learned a few
things in the big, bad real world.

01:20:41.386 --> 01:20:43.504
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:20:43.871 --> 01:20:45.680
We're gonna rule the world.

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.764
We could be together.

01:20:51.127 --> 01:20:53.041
Get your own geek.

01:21:17.984 --> 01:21:19.761
Too late, Flynn.

01:21:20.099 --> 01:21:22.231
The power of the Spear is mine.

01:21:27.175 --> 01:21:30.033
You're the best
they could come up with?

01:21:31.366 --> 01:21:33.481
You're pathetic.

01:21:54.305 --> 01:21:56.525
You're too clumsy to even die properly.

01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:58.981
You say that now,
but I danced with your girl.

01:22:24.678 --> 01:22:28.158
Die assured that the Librarian
will be in far more capable hands.

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:30.368
Mine.

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:49.222
You keep your grubby hands to yourself.

01:22:53.031 --> 01:22:55.099
Anyone else want a piece of me?

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.612
Goodbye, Librarian.

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:25.708
If even one of the support stones
are off even by an inch...

01:23:26.498 --> 01:23:29.354
...the whole pyramid collapses.

01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:33.367
- I'd say this was out of alignment.
- I will destroy you.

01:23:33.701 --> 01:23:35.115
You never will.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:36.925
Know why?

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:41.005
Because the things that make life
worth living can't be thought here.

01:23:41.315 --> 01:23:43.406
They must be felt here.

01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:17.995
I believe...

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.185
...this belongs to the Library.

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.912
Left, left, left.

01:25:26.305 --> 01:25:28.745
Small steps. Small steps.

01:25:28.978 --> 01:25:30.836
What are you guys doing?

01:25:34.893 --> 01:25:36.846
Okay. Okay.

01:25:56.422 --> 01:25:58.535
I hope you saved receipts.

01:26:23.731 --> 01:26:28.421
Flynn is a librarian now,
but he's capable of so much more.

01:26:28.912 --> 01:26:32.980
He just needs the right woman
to push him.

01:26:33.487 --> 01:26:34.579
Mom.

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:38.225
You don't understand. Being a Librarian
is actually a pretty cool job.

01:26:39.048 --> 01:26:41.689
And you don't need to keep trying
to fix me up.

01:26:42.015 --> 01:26:43.668
I told you that.

01:26:43.939 --> 01:26:46.370
The mysterious Nicole.

01:26:46.747 --> 01:26:49.918
She's never quite around
to meet the mother.

01:26:50.303 --> 01:26:53.353
Well, it's complicated.

01:27:07.198 --> 01:27:08.985
Hey, handsome.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.108
Nicole, this is my mother.

01:27:16.561 --> 01:27:18.430
A pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Carsen.

01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:22.060
No, no, the pleasure is mine.

01:27:23.015 --> 01:27:25.840
The Deadly Scorpion League
has found H.G. Wells' time machine.

01:27:26.133 --> 01:27:28.782
- Only we can get it back.
- Deadly Scorpion League.

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:31.915
What is it with bad guys
and insect names for their cults?

01:27:32.505 --> 01:27:35.001
Mom, I gotta get going.

01:27:35.325 --> 01:27:37.923
See you soon.

01:27:38.573 --> 01:27:41.704
You're smiling. Why are you smiling?

01:27:42.046 --> 01:27:45.077
There's a dozen time-traveling ninjas
out to kill us.

01:27:45.369 --> 01:27:47.954
- Psychopath.
- Nerd.

01:27:48.285 --> 01:27:49.683
Hey, hey.
