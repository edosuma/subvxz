- [Steve] Yeah.

04:46.318 --> 04:48.686
[Dennis] Fuck, shit.

04:49.254 --> 04:51.857
Tom!

04:51.890 --> 04:54.658
I swear to God, Tom's the
worst driver we've ever had.

04:55.293 --> 04:56.827
[Dennis chuckles]

04:56.862 --> 04:59.131
You usually hide your
hangovers better.

04:59.164 --> 05:02.934
My mouth tastes like
nasty cinnamon whiskey.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.668
[Steve chuckles]

05:04.702 --> 05:06.770
The glitter won't come off.

05:06.804 --> 05:09.673
Yeah, uniform got glitter on it?

05:09.707 --> 05:10.976
Oh, no, the room was dark.

05:11.009 --> 05:13.812
I couldn't tell which one
was mine, so pretty sure

05:13.846 --> 05:16.082
this is her uniform
from the athletic store.

05:19.485 --> 05:23.356
Fine, all right, I get it

05:24.991 --> 05:26.392
It's unprofessional.

05:28.727 --> 05:30.729
It's cold as fuck out
here, man, thank you

05:30.762 --> 05:32.465
[chuckles]

05:32.498 --> 05:34.300

05:34.333 --> 05:36.302
[eerie music]

05:38.104 --> 05:39.804
I think they need help.

05:49.748 --> 05:52.385
[suspenseful music]

05:54.954 --> 05:57.123
I hope she wakes up.

05:57.156 --> 05:59.258
I think she's got
school in the morning.

06:01.761 --> 06:03.463
I'll take the kid.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.134
What happened?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.802
I was sleeping in the bedroom,

06:09.836 --> 06:14.074
and I heard French and,
and the wind.

06:17.311 --> 06:19.146
[Dennis] Sir, can you hear me?

06:21.448 --> 06:22.849
[Dennis] Okay, I've got a
chest wound.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.386
[suspenseful music]

06:26.420 --> 06:28.355
What'd you take, kid?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.091
[suspenseful music]

06:38.465 --> 06:40.133
[Dennis] How's it going
in there, Steve?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.337
OD, figurin' it out

06:44.404 --> 06:46.473
Miss, what'd the kid take?

06:46.506 --> 06:48.209
What you got in your pockets?

06:48.243 --> 06:50.144
Miss... fuck!

06:50.178 --> 06:51.212
[crack girlfriend] Heroin.

06:51.246 --> 06:52.280

06:58.819 --> 06:59.921

06:59.954 --> 07:02.223
That Narcan? Can I have some?

07:04.859 --> 07:06.494
[Jacobs] Hands,
where I can see them

07:08.396 --> 07:09.397
[Jacobs] Keep 'em up.

07:11.132 --> 07:12.867
[Jacobs] Drop your weapon.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.002
[Beaumont] He don't look good,
do he?

07:14.035 --> 07:16.237
[police radio chatter]

07:16.271 --> 07:17.405
[Dennis] How's it goin'
in there, man?

07:19.040 --> 07:21.209
Dispatch fucked up,
said assault.

07:21.242 --> 07:24.045
You show up to work dressed like
Tupac, the fuck you expect?

07:24.078 --> 07:25.847

07:34.122 --> 07:35.156
[Steve] How 'bout in there?

07:37.393 --> 07:42.097
[Dennis] We've got a penetrating
trauma in the torso,

07:42.131 --> 07:45.868
applying occlusive dressing

07:45.901 --> 07:47.536
to a sucking chest wound.

07:47.569 --> 07:49.905
[police radio chatter]

07:49.938 --> 07:52.941
And, hold on...
what's that sound?

07:54.276 --> 07:55.544
[Dennis] Knife wound
in his front.

07:57.112 --> 07:58.347
[Dennis] Exit out his back.

07:59.448 --> 08:00.582
[Steve] A what?

08:02.184 --> 08:04.153
[Dennis] We'll make an airway
en route.

08:04.186 --> 08:07.623
The fuck you lovebirds do
to these nice people?

08:07.656 --> 08:11.260
Heroin overdose in the back.
Knife wound.

08:11.293 --> 08:13.195
[police radio chatter]

08:13.228 --> 08:14.396
[Jacobs] He shoot H, too?

08:15.097 --> 08:16.432
You do this?

08:17.366 --> 08:19.401
Probably did it to himself.

08:19.435 --> 08:22.271
Designer drug been makin'
junkie monkeys go nuts.

08:22.304 --> 08:24.574
Ain't illegal though,
so the fuck you gonna do, son?

08:25.241 --> 08:26.476
Back me up.

08:26.509 --> 08:28.311
Yeah, heroin possession
is though.

08:29.913 --> 08:32.015
You want to tell us where you
hid the weapon,

08:32.048 --> 08:35.485
the, um, the what, the uh?

08:35.518 --> 08:36.885
[Dennis] Three foot long knife.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.355
[police radio chatter]

08:38.388 --> 08:39.923
But isn't that a...

08:44.059 --> 08:46.496
Wanna save yourself some trouble
and tell us where the sword is?

08:46.529 --> 08:48.965
[suspenseful music]

08:50.066 --> 08:51.534
Still waters run deep.

08:53.436 --> 08:58.041
<i>Habla Ingl√©s, por favor?</i>

08:59.342 --> 09:00.977
[sniffs]

09:10.253 --> 09:12.323
[suspenseful music]

09:12.356 --> 09:14.925
- [radio chatter]
- Let's get him outta here.

09:14.959 --> 09:16.026
[Dennis] Yeah.

09:17.395 --> 09:19.630
[suspenseful music]

09:31.308 --> 09:33.377
[siren wails]

09:42.987 --> 09:45.923

[thunder rumbling]

10:00.605 --> 10:02.140
[clanks]

10:06.378 --> 10:09.080
[Dennis] Don't have kids
18 years apart, dude.

10:09.114 --> 10:11.650
Well, you can't,
'cause we're old as fuck,

10:11.683 --> 10:15.120
but gotta keep that window slim.

10:15.153 --> 10:16.588
At least you can get
a free babysitter.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.391
[clanks]

10:19.424 --> 10:22.360
And even though Brianna's 18,
and I love my daughter to death,

10:22.394 --> 10:24.095
she's a fuckin' awful
babysitter.

10:27.599 --> 10:29.568
[Nurse Hall] The pills will help
against HIV.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.338
It'll take about six weeks
to know for sure,

10:33.371 --> 10:35.640
but I've never had a positive
from a needle stick.

10:37.409 --> 10:40.645
I sent it to the fast lab,
so give you a call tomorrow

10:40.679 --> 10:42.547
about everything else.

10:42.581 --> 10:44.583
Is there any reason we
shouldn't do a full workup?

10:44.616 --> 10:48.120
Ignorance is bliss,
that's about it.

10:48.154 --> 10:51.290
Hangovers worse than usual, but
that's probably from the drinkin

10:51.324 --> 10:52.992
and recreational drug use.

10:54.293 --> 10:56.229
We'll ignore the ganja
and booger sugar markers

10:56.262 --> 10:57.630
Thank you.

11:03.503 --> 11:05.671
Hey, what'd you get my baby
daughter?

11:05.705 --> 11:08.307
[Steve] Uh, some condoms,
magnums.

11:08.341 --> 11:09.575
[Dennis] Ah, Christ.

11:09.609 --> 11:12.144
[Steve] Nah, they're earrings,
man.

11:12.178 --> 11:14.380
She's one, man,
nothing's pierced.

11:14.413 --> 11:16.582
It's strategy. So when you
give her the earrings,

11:16.616 --> 11:19.185
she'll be old enough to know
that I got 'em for her.

11:19.218 --> 11:20.386
Okay.

11:20.419 --> 11:22.088
A tiny dress would be
a waste of money.

11:22.121 --> 11:25.525
Look, babe, Uncle Steve's
sittin' all the way over here,

11:25.558 --> 11:27.593
because he went and slept
with all mommy's friends

11:27.627 --> 11:29.795
before they married all
those men over there.

11:29.829 --> 11:30.898
- [Steve] That's not true.
- [Tara] Yes...

11:30.931 --> 11:33.332
- [Dennis] Oh, it's kinda true.
- [Tara] Yes, it is.

11:33.366 --> 11:35.268
[Steve] Let me hold the baby,
come on, let the girls see

11:35.301 --> 11:37.204
- what they're missin'.
- Oh, that's a terrible idea.

11:37.237 --> 11:38.472
[Steve] Come on,
I'd be a great dad, come on.

11:38.505 --> 11:40.274
- Oh boy, okay.
- [Dennis] No, no.

11:40.307 --> 11:41.375
- [Steve] look at that.
- [Dennis] Oh no, oh God.

11:41.408 --> 11:43.510
- [Steve] Hey, ladies. Oh no.
- [Tara] Oh, the baby.

11:43.544 --> 11:45.312
- [Dennis] Bad idea, bad idea.
- [baby cries]

11:45.345 --> 11:46.613
[Steve] Oh, wait,
why's your baby...

11:46.647 --> 11:48.081
And there we go!
What did you do?

11:48.115 --> 11:49.349
- [Steve] No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, give her back.

11:49.383 --> 11:52.819
[Tara] I think you busted her.
Give her back, give her back.

11:52.854 --> 11:55.289
- Racist baby.
- [Dennis chuckles]

11:55.322 --> 11:57.457
- [Steve laughs]
- [Tara] No.

11:59.861 --> 12:01.528
She seems happy.

12:04.831 --> 12:07.200
Yeah, no.

12:10.470 --> 12:11.838
Give her a break, man.

12:11.873 --> 12:14.107
She work during the day
with lawyers,

12:15.509 --> 12:17.177
stay up all night with the kids,

12:17.210 --> 12:18.512
then have to deal with
your ugly mug.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.360
I'm gonna go say what's up
to Brianna

12:33.528 --> 12:35.663
She's bein' a little emo,

12:35.697 --> 12:37.866
incorrectly thinks you're cooler
than me, 'cause I'm her dad

12:37.900 --> 12:40.401
and you're just some asshole
who pops up from time to time.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.343
Yo, B.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.811
Hey, what up?

12:49.845 --> 12:51.479
- I got somethin' for you.
- Yeah.

12:58.921 --> 13:01.556
You poured me a cheap one.

13:01.589 --> 13:04.325
You're not old enough to know
what cheap beer is yet.

13:04.359 --> 13:07.695
I'm 18, and I know this is some
cheap-ass lager.

13:07.729 --> 13:10.264
Fuck, stop sayin' your age.
I don't want to think

13:10.298 --> 13:11.800
about 18 years goin' by
that fast.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.606
Why you sittin' over here
by yourself on this shitty rock?

13:17.640 --> 13:22.778
There's cake and barbecue and
old, fat people over there.

13:22.811 --> 13:23.847
There's something wrong with me.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.381
[chuckles]

13:25.414 --> 13:28.550
Uh, no, no one died or anything,
I just, uh, I, uh...

13:28.584 --> 13:30.419
[phone vibrates]
Oh, excuse me for one second.

13:32.488 --> 13:33.722
Hello?

13:33.756 --> 13:35.324
[tense music]

13:42.531 --> 13:45.668
Yeah, I'll be there on Tuesday,
Doctor, thank you.

- [phone rings]

14:01.251 --> 14:03.453
[groans]

14:03.486 --> 14:07.357
[park girl] Fuck, firemen
have to get up early.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.259
[Steve] Yeah.

14:10.995 --> 14:12.696
[splashes]

14:14.564 --> 14:16.332
[Steve] What time
you go to work?

14:16.366 --> 14:17.467
[park girl] I'm between jobs,

14:17.500 --> 14:19.669
so I thought it'd be a good time
to visit with friends,

14:19.703 --> 14:22.572
but I'm thinkin' about makin'
an app for power crystals,

14:22.605 --> 14:25.709
or astrology, or both,
I don't know.

14:25.742 --> 14:29.245
[Steve] That sounds like
a really bad idea.

14:29.279 --> 14:31.916
[Steve] Look,
I have to run to work, so, um.

14:31.949 --> 14:35.452
Uh, oh, it was nice to meet you.

14:39.522 --> 14:41.691
[Steve] It was nice
to meet you, too.

14:41.725 --> 14:43.593
[Steve] Be sure to lock the door
on your way out, okay?

14:50.434 --> 14:52.803
[somber music]

15:02.613 --> 15:04.448
[sobbing]

15:13.624 --> 15:16.761
Brianna wants to move onto
campus, a room opened up.

15:21.032 --> 15:22.466
That's what she wants?

15:24.735 --> 15:25.770
Yeah.

15:33.344 --> 15:36.215
I'll, uh, I'll miss her.

15:40.086 --> 15:41.486
[wood scratches]

15:48.493 --> 15:50.930
Gonna go with seven milligrams
of morphine, in case the burn's

15:50.963 --> 15:52.764
second degree.
You think of anything else?

15:52.798 --> 15:54.800
Uh, dry wraps.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.735
Hey, can you reach me
a codeine, please?

15:59.071 --> 16:00.472
- [tires screeching]
- [grunts]

16:00.505 --> 16:02.374
Shit, fuckin' Tom!

16:03.775 --> 16:05.677
Well, at least it's not you
driving.

16:05.710 --> 16:06.645
[Steve] What the fuck are you
talking about?

16:06.678 --> 16:07.546
- [Steve] I'm a great driver.
- No, you're not.

16:07.579 --> 16:08.780
[Steve] I'm the best driver
you know.

16:08.814 --> 16:12.551
Nope, and a black man drivin'
through the Garden District,

16:12.584 --> 16:14.053
we'd be pulled over so much,
there'd be people dyin'

16:14.086 --> 16:15.554
- all over New Orleans.
- [pills clatter]

16:16.521 --> 16:20.425

16:29.635 --> 16:32.638
[suspenseful music]

16:47.087 --> 16:48.721
Where's the victim?

16:48.754 --> 16:50.991
Why'd y'all tell dispatch
there was a burn victim?

16:52.159 --> 16:53.726
[Jacobs] There he is.

16:56.629 --> 17:00.067
Yeah, uh, that's a body,
not a burn victim.

17:00.901 --> 17:02.501
New kid called it in.

17:02.535 --> 17:03.669
What happened to him?

17:03.703 --> 17:07.740
Passed out with a cigarette
in his mouth or, you know.

17:10.042 --> 17:11.612
What?

17:11.645 --> 17:13.948
Beaumont, what'd you call this?

17:13.982 --> 17:16.483
[Beaumont] Spontaneous
human combustion.

17:16.516 --> 17:18.785
- [police radio chatter]
- He's way into that shit.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.721
Yeah, how do we put that
in a report?

17:20.753 --> 17:24.959
Anyways, somethin' to be aware
of, honey bears.

17:24.992 --> 17:26.425
Passed out smoking, easy enough.

17:28.997 --> 17:31.565
It's evidence or whatever,
so maybe don't touch it.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.077
- [bird squawks]
- [dog barks]

17:43.111 --> 17:45.679

18:01.163 --> 18:02.664

18:20.215 --> 18:21.816
[sighs]

18:33.896 --> 18:36.899
[siren wailing]

18:47.177 --> 18:50.846
[radio chatter]

18:50.880 --> 18:52.614
- [Bob] It's a snake bite.
- [Steve] Yeah, no shit.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.555
Miss, you happen to know
what kind of snake bit you?

18:59.990 --> 19:01.657
Travis.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.860
We need to figure out what kind
of poison this is.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.661
[Bob] A Venom.

19:05.694 --> 19:08.064
It's not poison, it's venom.

19:08.098 --> 19:09.832
- That's what I said.
- That's not what you said.

19:09.866 --> 19:11.001
That's exactly what I said.

19:11.034 --> 19:12.969
My ears be working and shit,
that ain't what you said...

19:13.003 --> 19:14.536
So you gonna tell me what I said
two seconds ago?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.106
That's okay, okay, okay.

19:16.139 --> 19:17.740
Well, he's gotta be here
somewhere.

19:17.773 --> 19:20.076
We've searched through
everything, man. It's not here.

19:20.110 --> 19:21.244
Travis.
[cries]

19:21.277 --> 19:23.279
Oh, she checked in with
her boyfriend.

19:24.314 --> 19:28.018
- Travis.
- [Steve] Dennis, look.

19:28.051 --> 19:31.221
Dispatch, unit 101 requesting
back up to the 9th Street Hotel.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.957
We got a snakebite and
an unknown possible O.D.

19:36.793 --> 19:40.830
A snake on the second
floor of a fucking hotel.

19:40.865 --> 19:42.299
[Steve] You remember that
snakebite we ran out on

19:42.333 --> 19:44.135
in the boonies near Chalmette?

19:45.668 --> 19:48.973
Hey, Miss, are you in
a Pentecostal religion?

19:49.006 --> 19:50.840
- [breathes heavily]
- [radio chatter]

19:50.875 --> 19:52.809
Some dude walkin' around
with a fucking copperhead,

19:52.842 --> 19:54.544
- he thinks God's gonna save him.
- It ain't no fuckin' copperhead.

19:55.346 --> 19:56.414
Well, what is it, bruh?

19:56.447 --> 19:59.682
I mean, the punctures,
they're not the right size,

19:59.716 --> 20:02.119
and her response to the... venom

20:02.153 --> 20:08.325
it could only be a fuckin'..
Eastern Diamondback Rattler?

20:10.027 --> 20:11.728
There hasn't been an Eastern
Diamondback

20:11.761 --> 20:14.865
seen in Louisiana in decades

20:14.899 --> 20:16.800
[Leah breathes shakily]

20:20.237 --> 20:22.705
All right, want to help me
find it?

20:22.739 --> 20:24.276
I know I can grab that
motherfucker.

20:24.309 --> 20:25.877
[Dennis] Okay.

20:25.911 --> 20:28.813
Miss, I'm gonna find your friend

20:28.846 --> 20:30.748
Steve here's gonna mark the rate
of swelling,

20:30.781 --> 20:32.984
so the ER know how much
anti-venom to use, okay?

20:34.718 --> 20:36.888
This is fucking pointless,
okay, let's go.

20:37.856 --> 20:39.024
All right, y'all be safe.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.994
[shuddering]

20:43.862 --> 20:46.331
[suspenseful music]

20:51.903 --> 20:53.905
[car approaching]

20:53.939 --> 20:55.907
- [siren wailing]
- [knocks]

20:57.842 --> 20:58.843
Is it broken?

20:59.677 --> 21:01.246
There was a loud crash

21:01.279 --> 21:03.115
Something might have
hit the sensor.

21:08.954 --> 21:11.357
[clanks]

21:12.892 --> 21:15.228
[suspenseful music]

21:26.873 --> 21:29.375
[siren wailing]

21:55.935 --> 21:59.873
[Doctor] It's, um,
it's an odd one.

21:59.907 --> 22:02.276
[Doctor] You see here?
That's your pineal gland.

22:02.309 --> 22:05.345
Now usually when there's a tumor
in this area, it's inside,

22:05.379 --> 22:09.116
but yours is at the top,
here, like a soda cap.

22:09.149 --> 22:10.816
[Doctor] I've never quite
seen that.

22:10.850 --> 22:12.186
So what are you saying?

22:12.219 --> 22:13.987
[Doctor] Usually,
an adult pineal gland

22:14.021 --> 22:15.821
is calcified to some extent,

22:15.856 --> 22:18.824
basically hardening with age,
but yours is like a teenager's.

22:21.761 --> 22:24.764
My boyfriend's New Agey friend
thinks it's a third eye seat of

22:24.797 --> 22:28.268
the soul or whatever, so maybe
your unique endocrine gland

22:28.302 --> 22:30.736
makes you more enlightened.

22:30.770 --> 22:32.272
So how does that affect
the cancer?

22:32.306 --> 22:34.274
[Doctor] It suggests to me
it's been there a while,

22:34.308 --> 22:36.910
but it also looks like a
glioblastoma,

22:36.944 --> 22:38.345
which are extremely
aggressive so...

22:38.378 --> 22:40.080
So it won't be a slow death?

22:44.850 --> 22:45.986
I gave you the good news first.

22:47.188 --> 22:49.057
[door opens]

22:52.393 --> 22:54.929
[approaching footsteps]

22:55.396 --> 22:57.031
Hello.

22:57.065 --> 22:59.434
[Tara] Hey listen, I know you're
like a grown-ass lady

22:59.467 --> 23:01.035
about to move out of my house,

23:01.069 --> 23:03.171
but if you're gonna stay out
all night,

23:03.204 --> 23:05.206
can you at least text us,
please?

23:06.874 --> 23:08.176
All right.

23:08.209 --> 23:09.510
[Tara] All right?

23:11.112 --> 23:12.180
Good morning.

23:12.213 --> 23:13.448
- Good morning
- [Tara] I love you.

23:13.481 --> 23:14.848
I love you, too.

23:23.224 --> 23:24.959
The bad news is it's inoperable,

23:24.993 --> 23:27.428
and we'll have to begin
treatment no matter what.

23:27.462 --> 23:29.264
[Doctor] We'll have to track it.

23:29.297 --> 23:30.865
Truthfully,
you could have six weeks

23:30.898 --> 23:32.867
or you could have 60 years

23:32.900 --> 23:35.871
There's a degree of chance,
but closer to six weeks

23:35.904 --> 23:37.473
if we don't start you on
radiation immediately.

23:41.010 --> 23:42.444
I, uh...

23:52.854 --> 23:55.357
In the meantime, here's some
support groups

23:55.391 --> 23:57.559
and supplementary
alternative therapies

23:57.593 --> 24:01.964
that patients have found helpful
and ways of telling your family.

24:05.234 --> 24:06.834
[sighs]

24:11.140 --> 24:13.442
[ball bouncing]

24:13.475 --> 24:15.277
- [Dennis] Whoa!
- [Brianna] Ah.

24:21.650 --> 24:27.590
All right, what's up with your
grades? Are you depressed?

24:28.258 --> 24:31.094
What? No.

24:31.127 --> 24:34.497
Just, um, I don't know
what I wanna do.

24:35.565 --> 24:37.133
About what?

24:37.167 --> 24:39.302
My pregnancy.

24:39.336 --> 24:41.571
Yeah, the father, he's being
really weird about it.

24:43.373 --> 24:46.209
No, like,

24:46.242 --> 24:49.612
like for work, like a job, you
know, when college is done.

24:49.646 --> 24:52.148
Oh, so you have a,
you have a C average

24:52.182 --> 24:54.050
because you don't know what you
wanna be when you grow up?

24:54.084 --> 24:56.286
Well, now you're making it sound
ridiculous, but,

24:56.319 --> 24:59.622
seriously, it's a lot of like
crazy hard work

24:59.656 --> 25:03.126
for not knowing where it's going
or if I can even do it.

25:06.363 --> 25:10.033
[clanks]
Of course you can do it.

25:10.066 --> 25:12.503
All right, let's think about
this. What do you like?

25:15.539 --> 25:16.640
When you were a kid,
you used to love watching

25:16.674 --> 25:17.908
the X-Files with me.

25:19.443 --> 25:21.045
You should be an FBI agent.

25:21.078 --> 25:23.013
[ball bounces]

25:28.319 --> 25:30.187
[dramatic music]

25:30.221 --> 25:33.090
All right.
Let's play Horse without the E

25:35.292 --> 25:38.396
Look, I'm gonna say
what I always say,

25:40.164 --> 25:41.932
but just listen this time.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.374
[ominous music]

26:00.318 --> 26:02.687
- [coin jingles]
- [sighs]

26:16.768 --> 26:19.671
You remember this song from
high school?

26:19.704 --> 26:23.542
Redman sampled Claude Debussy.

26:23.575 --> 26:25.377
Funny I can remember that,
but I can't remember

26:25.410 --> 26:26.913
four years of AP French.

26:28.647 --> 26:29.714
Life's not fair.
[woman laughing]

26:31.249 --> 26:32.317
Hey.

26:34.486 --> 26:36.154
Happy birthday.

26:36.188 --> 26:37.589
[indistinct chatter]

26:37.622 --> 26:38.925
[chuckles]

26:42.794 --> 26:44.029
Boom.

26:49.602 --> 26:55.608
Uh, it's real science-y.

26:55.641 --> 26:58.578
[Dennis chuckles]
Yeah. Thanks, man.

26:58.611 --> 27:00.246
You know, when you think
about it,

27:00.279 --> 27:02.748
strip clubs are like the one
place you really can't have sex.

27:03.816 --> 27:05.218
Highlights certain things.

27:05.251 --> 27:07.620
[indistinct chatter]

27:09.589 --> 27:12.358
Doubts, man, they never go away.

27:12.391 --> 27:14.627
You know, you think the wedding
day is gonna dissolve that,

27:14.660 --> 27:17.096
and it is profound, but,
you know, the doubts,

27:17.129 --> 27:18.364
- they never go.
- I get it, bro.

27:18.397 --> 27:19.565
You're a guy in a relationship.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.435
You want this?

27:23.669 --> 27:24.670
No.

27:28.307 --> 27:30.676
But there's these few hours
on a Sunday morning,

27:30.710 --> 27:33.179
after breakfast,
the kids are there,

27:33.212 --> 27:34.280
we're having coffee together,

27:34.313 --> 27:37.184
listening to music,
and I feel like

27:37.217 --> 27:38.785
I'm supposed to feel, you know?

27:38.819 --> 27:40.687
I haven't felt anything but

27:40.721 --> 27:43.290
whiskey and a hard dick
in a decade.

27:44.658 --> 27:45.792
[Dennis] You're a blessed man.

27:46.793 --> 27:49.096
[indistinct chatter]

27:50.564 --> 27:53.267
All right, as your humble,

27:53.300 --> 27:54.735
hypocritical, idiot,

27:54.768 --> 27:57.504
drunken, birthday celebratin'
best friend,

27:58.839 --> 28:00.574
what's goin' on
with all the pain killers?

28:01.341 --> 28:02.376
It's fine, man.

28:02.409 --> 28:05.345
I know, I know, just promise
me you won't become

28:05.379 --> 28:06.713
a junkie-paramedic-cliche.

28:09.182 --> 28:12.219
I promise I won't become
a junkie-paramedic-cliche.

28:13.587 --> 28:15.722

29:01.904 --> 29:03.504
Upstairs balcony!

29:08.643 --> 29:10.211
Miss, can you hear me?

29:11.313 --> 29:12.414
Can you hear me?

29:12.448 --> 29:13.515
W-W-What?

29:15.284 --> 29:16.352
Do you know your name?

29:21.457 --> 29:22.758
I'm not the police.

29:27.229 --> 29:29.732
You, you need to help Tim.
He has a heart condition,

29:29.765 --> 29:32.234
and I think he took
too much coke.

29:32.267 --> 29:33.903
Before I passed out,

29:33.937 --> 29:35.437
his chest was hurting.

29:35.471 --> 29:36.940
Okay, okay, I'll get to Tim.

29:36.973 --> 29:38.707
I just need to know if there's
somebody else

29:38.741 --> 29:39.742
that might need some help.

29:41.677 --> 29:43.212
Brianna.

29:47.884 --> 29:50.352
Okay, where's Brianna,
and what did she take?

29:50.386 --> 29:52.721
She took the fake Ayahuasca
from the store

29:52.755 --> 29:54.790
when she was sitting
right there.

29:56.492 --> 29:58.728

Just go and check her room?

30:17.347 --> 30:19.716
Yeah, I know, just please,
just please do it.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.834
How can I help you, sir?

31:43.903 --> 31:45.737
You have Synchronic?

31:45.771 --> 31:46.873
Uh.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.610
- How many?
- [Steve] All of 'em.

31:58.383 --> 31:59.451
You have any more in the back?

32:01.453 --> 32:03.388
- Where?
- The back, back inventory

32:03.421 --> 32:05.824
Oh we don't, we don't have that.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.325
So when do you get more?

32:09.361 --> 32:10.862
[chimes]

32:12.965 --> 32:15.467
No, we don't, it's discontinued.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.435
This happens a lot
with that stuff back there.

32:19.504 --> 32:20.672
How much?

32:22.408 --> 32:24.211
- [calculator clacks]
- $105.14.

32:28.081 --> 32:30.483
You have good people dying

32:41.561 --> 32:43.030
I'm so sorry.

32:43.063 --> 32:45.132
I'm sorry, I didn't even know
I was bothering you.

32:45.165 --> 32:47.400
- I just, like, apologize...
- [door closes]

32:48.601 --> 32:50.436
[dog barks]

32:51.404 --> 32:52.906
[honks]

32:54.141 --> 32:56.442
- [Kermani] Excuse me, sir.
- What?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.644
[Kermani] I know this sounds
strange, but, uh,

32:58.678 --> 33:00.646
could I buy that Synchronic
off of you

33:00.680 --> 33:02.883
- for triple what you just paid?
- No!

33:02.916 --> 33:05.451
Go home to your wife or
your girlfriend, whoever.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.087
Be glad you didn't ingest
this shit.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.422
- I'll give you $2,000.
- Go home.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.491
[engine revs]

33:11.525 --> 33:14.561
[suspenseful music]

33:15.796 --> 33:18.665
[machine whirrs]

33:21.635 --> 33:23.837
[Tara] The cell phone company
said her cell is still inactive,

33:23.872 --> 33:26.673
but I got a hold of one of
her friends from class

33:26.707 --> 33:28.408
who thinks that maybe
she saw her

33:28.442 --> 33:31.545
at a party earlier that night
and so I think if we just,

33:31.578 --> 33:33.847
we just keep posting on
her social media.

33:36.850 --> 33:37.952
[Dennis] What?

33:39.921 --> 33:41.022
What are you doing?

33:41.055 --> 33:45.159
I'm printing these out,
and then I'm gonna put 'em up.

33:45.193 --> 33:49.429
[Tara] Can't you do something
else while they're printing?

33:49.463 --> 33:51.632
Like call every hospital
and jail in Louisiana

33:51.665 --> 33:54.568
and call the credit card company
and ask the police to

33:54.601 --> 33:56.436
search the Mississippi
while you were asleep?

33:56.470 --> 34:00.541
[printer clicks]

34:04.812 --> 34:07.149
Why would you search
the Mississippi?

34:07.182 --> 34:08.449
[Dennis] You know what I mean.

34:08.483 --> 34:10.585
She's not, she's not dead,

34:10.618 --> 34:12.453
so why would you search
the Mississippi?

34:12.487 --> 34:14.956
We have to be realistic.

34:14.989 --> 34:17.859
I'm gonna, I'm gonna hire
a private investigator.

34:17.893 --> 34:20.996
- The entire police department...
- What are you doing?

34:27.768 --> 34:29.804
[dramatic music]

34:29.837 --> 34:31.839
- [baby cries]
- [Tara sighs]

34:46.688 --> 34:48.190
[clattering]

34:54.097 --> 34:56.565
[light switch clicks]

34:56.598 --> 34:59.002
Shh, shh, shh, lay down boy,
lay down, lay down.

35:02.272 --> 35:04.540
Stay, stay.

35:15.784 --> 35:16.852
[light switch clicks]

35:25.128 --> 35:26.196
[light switch clicks]

35:28.298 --> 35:29.565
Who's there?

35:31.334 --> 35:32.936
[rattling]

35:32.969 --> 35:35.805
[panting]

35:48.185 --> 35:49.753
[door open and closes]

35:51.055 --> 35:52.189
[door open and closes]

35:57.361 --> 35:58.929
- Oh, oh shit!
- [Kermani] Hey!

35:58.963 --> 35:59.997
Come, come the fuck outta there!

36:00.031 --> 36:00.864
- [Kermani] Wait, wait, wait!
- Get outta my house!

36:00.898 --> 36:02.033
- Wait!
- You motherfucker, what the fuck

36:02.066 --> 36:03.067
- are you doin' in my closet.
- I'm not here to hurt you!

36:03.100 --> 36:05.036
- Get outta my house!
- My name is Dr. Kermani.

36:05.069 --> 36:05.903
What the fuck are you doin'?
I don't care.

36:05.936 --> 36:07.637
I'm the chemist
who created Synchronic

36:07.670 --> 36:09.173
- What are you..
- [Kermani pants]

36:09.206 --> 36:10.241
You're what?

36:10.274 --> 36:11.976
My name is Dr. Kermani.

36:12.009 --> 36:14.111
I'm the chemist who created
Synchronic.

36:14.145 --> 36:16.713
[both panting]

36:18.382 --> 36:19.649
Come outta there.

36:19.682 --> 36:20.750
Okay.

36:23.621 --> 36:25.257
- Take your jacket off.
- Okay.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.825
Turn around.

36:32.164 --> 36:34.732
[Kermani] Wait, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

36:34.765 --> 36:36.600
[Kermani] No, no, no.

36:36.634 --> 36:38.136
Hello, yes, I have an intruder

36:38.170 --> 36:39.670
- in my house.
- [Kermani] No, no, wait, wait.

36:39.703 --> 36:40.771
- [Kermani] I'm here to help!
- Yes, ma'am.

36:40.805 --> 36:42.807
- Cause I heard you in the store.
- My address is 1827

36:42.840 --> 36:43.909
- You've seen what it does!
- Alexandria Avenue.

36:43.942 --> 36:45.310
- Help, man!
- Thank you.

36:45.343 --> 36:48.914
All right, you have until
they get here, all right?

36:48.947 --> 36:50.048
Now, lucky for you this
neighborhood,

36:50.082 --> 36:52.084
has a shitty response time.

36:52.117 --> 36:55.153
Can I, okay, all right.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.225
I make synthetic drugs.

37:03.295 --> 37:06.898
What I would do is create
new drugs

37:06.932 --> 37:10.236
very similar to illegal drugs,
but the molecules just

37:10.269 --> 37:12.305
different enough to be legal.

37:12.338 --> 37:13.839
I know what designer drugs are.

37:13.872 --> 37:15.975
The FDA finally cracked
down on every variant

37:16.008 --> 37:18.277
we could come up with so
we rushed out to market

37:18.311 --> 37:22.048
with what was meant to be
a DMT-like drug

37:22.081 --> 37:25.151
that we synthesized from a
red flower that only grows

37:25.184 --> 37:29.188
in a very isolated region
of the California desert...

37:29.222 --> 37:31.224
Can I use the back of this?

37:37.897 --> 37:41.400
My mother recently passed away,
I know how hard it is.

37:41.434 --> 37:44.003
- [Kermani] Condolences.
- It's me.

37:44.036 --> 37:47.739
I have a tumor on
my pineal gland.

37:49.175 --> 37:50.243
Sorry to hear that.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.947
But actually, um,

37:56.715 --> 37:59.887
Synchronic messes
with the pineal,

37:59.920 --> 38:03.924
so you experience time as it
actually is

38:03.957 --> 38:07.361
rather than the linear,
one-event-after-another way

38:07.394 --> 38:08.996
that we normally experience it.

38:12.032 --> 38:13.400
Okay, um...

38:14.268 --> 38:15.435
uh, here

38:17.304 --> 38:19.439
You drop the needle on the song
you wanna play,

38:19.473 --> 38:22.910
but they're all always there

38:22.943 --> 38:26.880
These tracks are like time,
right?

38:26.914 --> 38:30.050
Synchronic is the needle.

38:37.823 --> 38:42.362
Adults partially go, appearing
like ghosts in the past,

38:42.396 --> 38:48.036
but kids, since their pineal
gland hasn't calcified,

38:48.069 --> 38:50.771
they physically go to another
time entirely,

38:51.940 --> 38:53.308
[Kermani]
Sometimes not returning.

38:58.179 --> 39:00.148
You expect me to believe
that you came here

39:00.181 --> 39:04.018
to atone for your evils, and
I'm just gonna give you back

39:04.052 --> 39:05.153
your drug that's killing kids?

39:05.186 --> 39:07.821
I mean, I only had a few
accounts at some gas stations,

39:07.854 --> 39:10.024
smoke shops throughout
Louisiana, some other states.

39:10.058 --> 39:11.993
I've been driving around
buying them out.

39:13.261 --> 39:14.262
This was my last stop,

39:20.001 --> 39:22.370
Well, too bad, I flushed it all.

39:23.804 --> 39:24.805
So get out.

39:25.806 --> 39:26.873
It's all gone?

39:28.343 --> 39:29.377
Yeah.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.844
All of it, all of it's gone.

39:32.947 --> 39:34.083
Get the fuck out of my house.

39:44.526 --> 39:45.860
When Kyle recruited me

39:45.894 --> 39:48.163
I was working in a
generics lab in China.

39:50.065 --> 39:51.833
Would've done anything
to get back home,

39:54.103 --> 39:56.338
but I left a good teaching job
for that money, so...

40:07.316 --> 40:09.318
There's just one more sample
to eliminate.

40:15.357 --> 40:16.824
[door closes]

40:16.858 --> 40:18.994
[panting]

40:26.102 --> 40:28.505
[suspenseful music]

40:36.112 --> 40:39.149
[machine whirring]

40:45.088 --> 40:47.223
You know they say we see
everything once in this gig?

40:47.257 --> 40:49.059
[siren wailing]

40:49.092 --> 40:51.928
Pretty sure we've just seen
our first junkie sword fight.

40:54.631 --> 40:57.267
[indistinct chatter]

41:03.673 --> 41:06.142
- You all right?
- Yeah.

41:06.176 --> 41:08.844
It's just a little
tequila headache, I'm fine.

41:09.312 --> 41:11.415
[siren wailing]

41:22.593 --> 41:25.629
[Dennis] Time for your, uh,
your sermon again.

41:32.503 --> 41:33.537
[Steve] Sir,

41:36.974 --> 41:40.344
there was a time when Dennis
here and I were

41:40.378 --> 41:41.545
gonna go to med school,

41:43.948 --> 41:47.017
takin' a whole mess of science
pre-reqs.

41:49.420 --> 41:52.056
Dennis here hated a lot of it,

41:52.089 --> 41:57.128
but I sort of became a
armchair physicist.

41:57.161 --> 42:02.334
No equations or anything,
just fun theories and history.

42:03.702 --> 42:08.140
Like, do you know the letter
Einstein wrote

42:08.173 --> 42:11.109
to his dear friend
Michele Besso's wife

42:12.444 --> 42:13.945
after he passed away?

42:15.514 --> 42:17.115
That's all right.

42:18.116 --> 42:20.185
He said,

42:20.218 --> 42:22.654
"Now he has departed this
strange world

42:22.687 --> 42:24.222
a little ahead of me.

42:25.190 --> 42:26.525
This means nothing.

42:28.660 --> 42:30.162
People like us,

42:31.730 --> 42:34.065
who believe in physics,

42:35.534 --> 42:38.437
know that the distinction
between

42:38.470 --> 42:40.439
the past, present, and future

42:42.007 --> 42:44.276
is only a stubbornly...

42:45.745 --> 42:47.580
<i>persistent illusion."</i>

42:51.150 --> 42:52.985
- [groans]
- [vomits]

42:56.222 --> 42:57.256
[thwacks]

42:59.091 --> 43:00.493
[phone vibrates]

43:02.161 --> 43:03.529
- Hey, Captain.
- [captain] <i>Hey, Dennis,</i>

43:03.563 --> 43:05.064
<i>do you have a minute?</i>

43:05.097 --> 43:06.399
Yeah, what's up.

43:06.432 --> 43:07.633
[captain] <i>I have a discrepancy
between the morphine</i>

43:07.667 --> 43:10.736

pharmacy says we logged.</i>

43:10.770 --> 43:12.271
<i>I know you guys are clean,</i>

43:12.305 --> 43:14.173
<i>but keep an eye on other shifts,
would ya?</i>

43:15.308 --> 43:17.009
Yeah.

43:17.043 --> 43:18.478
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

43:19.579 --> 43:21.214
You know, you don't have to
be here.

43:21.247 --> 43:23.749
We can get another paramedic
to come in.

43:23.783 --> 43:26.018
I don't wanna go home,
I wanna fuckin' work.

43:26.052 --> 43:29.222
Yeah, but you and Tara
should be together.

43:29.255 --> 43:31.624

we have and open fracture</i>

43:31.657 --> 43:33.092

[tense music]

43:47.107 --> 43:48.709
[suspenseful music]

44:06.493 --> 44:08.228
Sir, can you tell me
what caused the injury?

44:08.262 --> 44:10.631
[babbling, laughing]

44:12.232 --> 44:13.367
Hey, do y'all know
what happened to him?

44:13.834 --> 44:15.469
[babbling]

44:16.703 --> 44:17.939
Did he fall from something?

44:17.972 --> 44:21.409
Sir, we can get you out of here
as soon as possible, all right,

44:21.442 --> 44:22.677
we just want to stabilize
the injury.

44:22.710 --> 44:24.379
and we'll take you to the ER,
all right?

44:24.412 --> 44:27.282
[speaking Creole]

44:27.315 --> 44:30.151
Use saline to remove any large
contaminants.

44:30.184 --> 44:31.486
I know.

44:31.519 --> 44:33.221
[man speaking Creole]

44:33.254 --> 44:35.790
Apply the splint.
Use some pressure.

44:35.823 --> 44:37.725
Stop tellin' me how to do
my job, all right?

44:37.759 --> 44:40.194
- Someone has to.
- What's that supposed to mean?

44:40.228 --> 44:41.829
Sir, do not smoke that now.

44:41.863 --> 44:44.299
[yelling in Creole]

44:44.332 --> 44:45.633
You show up to work fucked up,

44:45.667 --> 44:47.502
it's not gonna be on me
if you kill someone.

44:49.203 --> 44:51.272
[skeleton man laughing]

44:51.306 --> 44:53.474
[speaking Creole]

44:56.144 --> 44:58.279
[Steve vomits]

44:58.313 --> 45:00.415
We need to get a line
of morphine in him.

45:00.448 --> 45:02.517
You sure we have morphine?

45:02.550 --> 45:04.319
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

45:07.689 --> 45:09.458
You can't deal with reality,

45:09.491 --> 45:11.560
so you pop pills and get wasted
every night.

45:11.594 --> 45:12.661
The reality you can't deal with

45:12.695 --> 45:14.630
is you're a forty-something
child, and I've wasted

45:14.663 --> 45:16.231
half my life
on bullshit loyalty.

45:16.265 --> 45:18.467
Shut the fuck up!

45:18.500 --> 45:20.436
I'm so fuckin' tired of you
complainin'.

45:20.469 --> 45:22.671
You're disappointed in everybody
around you.

45:22.705 --> 45:24.740
All you do is complain about
your fucking wife,

45:24.773 --> 45:27.276
who's obviously too good
for you, and you don't give

45:27.309 --> 45:29.278
a shit about your family!

45:29.311 --> 45:30.479
I don't give a shit about
my family?

45:30.512 --> 45:32.748
Yeah, 'cause you're a selfish
ass who only cares about...

- Fuck you, D!
- [Dennis] Yeah.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.368
Fuck you.

45:52.401 --> 45:55.371
Fuck you, get back
in the ambulance

45:55.404 --> 45:57.440
Shut the fuck up!
Tom, no, I need you,

45:57.474 --> 45:58.909
come back, help me
for fuck's sake.

[Steve] Uh...

51:40.024 --> 51:41.926
[sighs]

51:41.959 --> 51:43.928
If you're watching this,
I'm probably trying to

51:43.961 --> 51:48.832
convince you of somethin' that's
pretty unbelievable or I'm dead.

51:49.200 --> 51:50.234
Uh...

51:53.137 --> 51:54.604
This...

51:54.637 --> 51:58.541
This is a time travel pill.

51:58.575 --> 52:01.078
It allows you to go back in time
for about seven minutes.

52:01.112 --> 52:02.645
I know it sounds...

52:04.281 --> 52:06.850
brain-damaged orangutan
fucking crazy, but I was...

52:06.883 --> 52:08.718
[sighs]

52:14.591 --> 52:16.093
I was just back in time.

52:17.694 --> 52:21.565
In this exact geographical
location,

52:21.599 --> 52:24.169
before it was all pumped out,
and it was still swampland.

52:26.604 --> 52:27.939
Now, another observation,

52:30.042 --> 52:33.778
things that touch you while
on the drug

52:33.811 --> 52:35.213
seem to be a little distorted.

52:36.847 --> 52:38.984
My best friend,

52:39.017 --> 52:44.289
Dennis Dannelly, who's probably
watchin' this if I'm dead,

52:44.322 --> 52:46.857
his daughter Brianna took it,
and she disappeared.

52:48.692 --> 52:50.162
So hopefully with these
experiments,

52:51.363 --> 52:53.131
I'll learn a way
to bring her back.

52:54.966 --> 52:56.134
[sighs]

52:57.903 --> 53:02.606
Or be stabbed by an early

Observation one.

54:02.002 --> 54:05.038
I'm not exactly sure why

54:05.072 --> 54:08.674
I went to a different time
than the first pill.

54:08.708 --> 54:12.745
The only difference is exactly
where I was in the room

54:13.713 --> 54:14.881
when the pill kicked in.

54:14.915 --> 54:16.883

56:56.079 --> 56:58.281
The past fucking sucks, man!

56:59.482 --> 57:02.919
And, observation two,

57:02.952 --> 57:05.188
the exact place where you are
when the drug kicks in

57:05.221 --> 57:07.890
determines the time
you go back to.

57:08.358 --> 57:09.360
For example,

57:12.530 --> 57:15.333
this spot took me to
the Ice Age twice.

57:17.435 --> 57:21.572
This spot took me to the swamp,
dick-ass conquistador.

57:23.341 --> 57:25.242
And also leaves the question,

57:27.611 --> 57:29.846
if this door works both ways,

57:31.916 --> 57:34.051
how did Brianna get stuck
back in time?

58:29.674 --> 58:31.042
That looks bad to you?

Just gross because it's them and
boring, 'cause they're boring.

58:39.384 --> 58:40.619
Tell you a story.

58:42.320 --> 58:45.158
There was a time your dad
was goin' through a drought,

58:45.191 --> 58:46.259
major drought.

58:48.261 --> 58:49.662
Girl wouldn't talk to him
to save her life.

58:49.695 --> 58:53.032
She would drown in a river
before talkin' to him.

58:53.065 --> 58:55.568
I met your mom in a bar
one night.

58:55.601 --> 58:59.105
She was really nice, but I was
tryin' to thin out my herd,

58:59.138 --> 59:01.707
too much goin' on.
So I set him up.

59:03.743 --> 59:05.711
Then you came along.

59:05.745 --> 59:09.615
Luckily, not ugly like your dad,
thanks to your mom.

59:09.649 --> 59:13.653
So I say all that to say,

59:13.686 --> 59:16.322
you're not gonna have the same
problems that your dad did.

You wanna go out? Let's go out.

01:00:02.402 --> 01:00:04.571
Yeah, I've got time
before my shift.

01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:06.240
No, you should sleep

01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:09.576
You're slow and clumsy when
you're well rested, so...

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.579
There's only so many ambulance
protein bars and IV hydration

01:00:12.613 --> 01:00:16.483

01:06:05.773 --> 01:06:07.142
[timer beeps]

01:06:10.578 --> 01:06:13.414
[dramatic music]

01:06:15.683 --> 01:06:17.485
Hawking!

01:06:19.454 --> 01:06:21.056
[hawking cries]

01:06:32.533 --> 01:06:33.868
Observation three.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:36.905
Don't...

01:06:39.607 --> 01:06:41.743
Don't be... shit!

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:43.979
Don't be late.

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:48.417
Obs...

01:06:50.086 --> 01:06:51.187
- Ooh.
- [dramatic music]

01:06:52.688 --> 01:06:54.124
So it seems you have to be
touching

01:06:54.157 --> 01:06:55.724
whatever you bring back,

01:06:55.758 --> 01:07:00.196
like quantum...
mixing or something.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:02.498
Hawking had on his collar, so...

01:07:06.835 --> 01:07:10.073
It's chaotic how much of
anything comes back safely.

01:07:10.739 --> 01:07:13.143
[dramatic music]

01:07:13.176 --> 01:07:18.814
Either way, there aren't enough
pills for me to go back and...

01:07:20.183 --> 01:07:21.617
find Hawking.

01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:25.654
And if you're late...

01:07:32.762 --> 01:07:34.131
[leash clanks]

01:07:41.571 --> 01:07:44.108
[bells playing]

01:07:44.141 --> 01:07:46.576
[Tara] You said that they
sounded like

01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:50.147
Rain Man on cocaine.
That is exactly what you said,

01:07:50.181 --> 01:07:51.848
it's a direct quote.

01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:53.850
- It's not very, very nice.
- Yeah, they do.

01:07:53.883 --> 01:07:54.784
Come on, babe.

01:07:54.818 --> 01:07:56.187
- They do.
- [Tara] Please, please, please,

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.620
Steve has other friends.

01:07:58.722 --> 01:07:59.856
Look, um,

01:08:01.959 --> 01:08:03.660
there's something
I never told you.

01:08:07.664 --> 01:08:09.566
During the Katrina cleanup,

01:08:10.234 --> 01:08:12.802
Steve got this call,

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:18.309
and a few coffins had been
ripped out of Lafayette Cemetery

01:08:18.341 --> 01:08:21.679
[Dennis] and ended up in some
Garden District yard.

01:08:21.712 --> 01:08:25.951
And a cleanup worker traced some
of the serial numbers

01:08:26.684 --> 01:08:28.086
back to Steve.

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.322
[birds chirping]

01:08:30.354 --> 01:08:31.889
[Dennis] Two of them were
his parents,

01:08:31.923 --> 01:08:34.059
and one was his
little sister Dana.

01:08:36.594 --> 01:08:39.897
And Dana was just a kid
when she died.

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:41.832
And when we came across
her coffin,

01:08:41.866 --> 01:08:43.135
it had been opened by looters,

01:08:44.902 --> 01:08:47.205
and seeing her tiny remains,

01:08:47.238 --> 01:08:48.906
all I could think about was
Brianna,

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:51.309
and I literally passed out.

01:08:54.145 --> 01:08:57.715
Pfft. And when I came to
on the porch,

01:08:57.747 --> 01:08:59.884
Steve was asking if I was okay.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:02.287
I mean, if I was okay.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.024
And I got up, and I was leaning
against one of those

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:08.928
rich assholes'
Roman columns while

01:09:08.961 --> 01:09:12.298
Steve watched his little sister

01:09:13.799 --> 01:09:16.667
being dragged out in her coffin
to the truck

01:09:16.701 --> 01:09:17.937
to join his parents.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.575
And that was his 30th birthday.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.710
Hello.

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:30.881
[clock chimes]

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:36.122

01:09:44.964 --> 01:09:47.100
The past was hell.

01:09:47.133 --> 01:09:49.368
They tryin' to make it all look
cozy and shit.

01:09:49.402 --> 01:09:51.002
Best part about the past

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:53.772
was the music, which,

01:09:53.805 --> 01:09:56.843
with your boy and them.

01:09:56.876 --> 01:09:58.778
he tryin' to rock out
to Chuck Berry.

01:10:00.214 --> 01:10:04.351
I try that, they'd put me
in jail or, or worse.

01:10:04.384 --> 01:10:06.987
[TV chatter]

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.388

[Steve] Three pills left.
Time to find Brianna.

01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.319

Aah!

01:11:25.033 --> 01:11:26.733
Brianna!

01:11:26.767 --> 01:11:30.171
[breathing heavily]

01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:16.518
[Steve] Have you seen a girl?

01:12:18.454 --> 01:12:19.990
[fire crackles]

01:12:22.359 --> 01:12:24.961
A young woman, a young lady?

01:12:35.405 --> 01:12:38.541
You, uh, what you, wait
a minute, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:12:38.575 --> 01:12:42.479
Hey, whoa, wow, what are you,
no, no! Wait, wait, no!

01:12:42.512 --> 01:12:46.983
Wait, wait, wait, no, no,
no, no, wait!

01:12:47.017 --> 01:12:48.518

01:14:27.552 --> 01:14:29.020
Oh, shit.

01:14:37.462 --> 01:14:39.164
Apparently,

01:14:40.265 --> 01:14:41.666
the present can anchor you.

01:14:45.271 --> 01:14:47.073

What are you doing on my roof?

01:14:54.347 --> 01:14:55.715
Are you sure this is where
Brianna was

01:14:55.748 --> 01:14:57.183
when she disappeared?

01:14:59.051 --> 01:15:00.186
No.

01:15:00.219 --> 01:15:02.622
She wandered off somewhere.

01:15:02.655 --> 01:15:04.724
Why the fuck didn't you
say that? I almost...

01:15:04.757 --> 01:15:06.959
[grunts]

01:15:06.993 --> 01:15:09.095
Go back inside,
you high as fuck!

[hip-hop music]

01:15:13.065 --> 01:15:15.368
[background chatter]

01:15:42.129 --> 01:15:43.230
[Dennis] With Brianna gone,

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:47.601
I think my marriage is, um...

01:15:49.236 --> 01:15:51.004
I think I'm getting a divorce.

01:15:51.038 --> 01:15:53.640
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Dennis sighs]

01:15:55.108 --> 01:15:56.210
She hates me.

01:15:57.578 --> 01:16:00.080
She knows me better than anyone,
and she hates me.

01:16:02.115 --> 01:16:04.418
And she's right.

01:16:04.451 --> 01:16:08.088
She made an oath to love me
unconditionally and she has.

01:16:09.056 --> 01:16:10.757
I made that same promise,

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.627
and every day I wish

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.630
I didn't hate half the music
she listens to,

01:16:16.663 --> 01:16:20.168
or that she wore sexier
underwear,

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:21.636
that her tits were bigger,

01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:25.306
that she didn't sound
so happy all the time,

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:27.675
because I think that
conspicuously happy people

01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:29.544
- are dumb.
- [chuckles]

01:16:32.447 --> 01:16:34.749
So I get frustrated and I,

01:16:36.484 --> 01:16:39.220
I start these ridiculous
arguments,

01:16:39.254 --> 01:16:41.456
secretly hoping that
she ends it, as if that wouldn't

01:16:41.489 --> 01:16:44.125
fucking destroy me.

01:16:44.158 --> 01:16:46.394
Brianna was the one thing
that was keeping us together,

01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:50.365
and now she's gone, so, uh...

01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:55.370
[Dennis sighs]

01:16:58.573 --> 01:17:02.610
Remember that trip we took to
Thailand and I...

01:17:02.644 --> 01:17:05.446
I got malaria and I was
in that shitty hospital

01:17:06.648 --> 01:17:08.384
and all I could think about
was her,

01:17:10.152 --> 01:17:11.420
getting home to her.

01:17:11.453 --> 01:17:14.256
[hip-hop music]

01:17:16.525 --> 01:17:17.793
That's how I feel now.

01:17:22.197 --> 01:17:23.566
She won't even look at me,

01:17:23.599 --> 01:17:25.067
because I'm such a fucking
asshole.

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:30.606
And I miss Brianna
so fucking much.

01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:36.211
[Dennis sobbing]

01:17:39.648 --> 01:17:42.184
[Dennis cries]

01:17:42.217 --> 01:17:44.720
This is about you, Tara,
and Brianna.

01:17:45.554 --> 01:17:46.689
Nothing else matters.

01:17:48.157 --> 01:17:49.758
And just so you know,
my life sucks.

01:17:49.792 --> 01:17:51.260
- [Dennis chuckles]
- Come on.

01:17:51.293 --> 01:17:53.462
I'm serious, man.

01:17:53.495 --> 01:17:56.866
It's no fun. You might see
James Bond,

01:17:56.900 --> 01:17:59.336
but I experience
Charlie Sheen, all right?

01:17:59.369 --> 01:18:00.804
[chuckles]

01:18:00.837 --> 01:18:02.772
What you and Tara have,

01:18:02.806 --> 01:18:06.343
even with all the fights,
the ups and downs, the doubts,

01:18:06.376 --> 01:18:07.777
I'd take that shit
in a heartbeat.

01:18:09.312 --> 01:18:11.481
I sleep around by default

01:18:11.514 --> 01:18:15.418
and then mourn the aspect
of myself that used to feel

01:18:15.452 --> 01:18:17.587
something above... fuckin'.

01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:23.126
But then I found out
I was dyin'.

01:18:29.466 --> 01:18:30.800
My brain...

01:18:32.268 --> 01:18:33.536
has a tumor.

01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:38.642
And all those things
just seem trivial.

01:18:40.276 --> 01:18:42.912
That there's meanin'
in the things I do have,

01:18:42.947 --> 01:18:46.150
and I want to spend the time
I have preservin' 'em.

01:18:47.818 --> 01:18:51.622
I've been in treatment and
I found out it's workin', but...

01:18:53.624 --> 01:18:54.792
when you're starin' down
at the end,

01:18:57.361 --> 01:19:01.699
you realize there are things
that are far worse than death.

01:19:03.834 --> 01:19:06.871
And none of those things are
what you were upset about.

01:19:06.904 --> 01:19:08.406
How long have you known?

01:19:10.775 --> 01:19:12.209
Couple of weeks.

01:19:12.243 --> 01:19:14.545
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't tell you. It's just...

01:19:14.578 --> 01:19:16.213
You know what, fuck you!

01:19:16.247 --> 01:19:18.215
Look, you have a right
to be mad, all right?

01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:20.818
But you understand why it hasn't
been a good time

01:19:20.851 --> 01:19:23.354
to tell you, right?

01:19:23.387 --> 01:19:24.922
Look, I'm tryin' to do my best,
man.

01:19:27.858 --> 01:19:29.794
[sighs]

01:19:33.398 --> 01:19:35.834
I was so close to making a bad
haircut joke earlier.

01:19:35.867 --> 01:19:37.269
[chuckles]

01:19:41.606 --> 01:19:42.741
[sniffs]

01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:51.750
You know, it turned out
it was Tom.

01:19:53.285 --> 01:19:55.620
[Dennis] Fuckin' driver
who took the morphine.

01:19:55.654 --> 01:19:57.789
You probably drove him to it.

01:19:57.823 --> 01:20:00.792
Hey, it's not misplaced rage
if the guy's a fuckin' idiot.

01:20:00.826 --> 01:20:01.893
[chuckles]

01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:04.863
[grunts]

01:20:04.896 --> 01:20:07.466
[crickets chirping]

01:20:14.974 --> 01:20:16.976
Ah!

01:20:17.009 --> 01:20:19.846
So you've really been lookin'
for the one this whole time?

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:33.626
You know the real tragedy of
meeting the love of your life?

01:20:36.096 --> 01:20:38.798
If it's happened,
it's behind you.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.935
It's not gonna happen again.

01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:46.372
And although it's wonderful,

01:20:46.405 --> 01:20:49.642
what's ahead of you,
it's really, really hard.

01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:59.318
You know, about that
treatment thing,

01:21:01.754 --> 01:21:04.590
I decided to put it on pause.

01:21:04.624 --> 01:21:05.825
- There's somethin' that came up,
- What are you talking about?

01:21:05.858 --> 01:21:06.893
- You're going to fucking chemo.
- Something, look, something

01:21:06.926 --> 01:21:09.329
came up that's really important
that I have to do.

01:21:09.363 --> 01:21:11.498
Then do it in chemo, bitch!

01:21:11.532 --> 01:21:14.334
You know the difference between
your life and mine?

01:21:14.368 --> 01:21:16.336
Do you wanna know what
the difference really is?

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:17.504
What?

01:21:18.672 --> 01:21:22.843
Random events, chance, and luck

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.880
Now, some people might think
it's God or the universe

01:21:26.914 --> 01:21:29.783
or what the fuck ever,

01:21:31.585 --> 01:21:33.021
but that's what it is.

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:36.423
[crickets chirps]

01:21:39.726 --> 01:21:41.695
Let's go see my family.

01:21:42.863 --> 01:21:44.631
I wanna show y'all somethin'

01:21:52.073 --> 01:21:55.343
[suspenseful music]

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.723
[Steve] There are things
worse than death.

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.028
[gasping and grunting]

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.102
[whimpers]

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.072
Shit.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.306
Right.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:27.943
Listen, I would do anything
to get her back, but this is...

01:22:27.977 --> 01:22:31.412
I know it's kangaroo shit loony,
I know, but we gotta try.

01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:33.882
I'm not saying we shouldn't but,

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:37.886
but you made it back last time,
okay, maybe not next time.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:40.488
And who knows what else
it's doing to you, I mean,

01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:42.423
the next dose could kill you.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:43.692
It should be me.

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:44.793
It's gotta be me.

01:22:45.861 --> 01:22:47.496
Look, I have the youth tumor.

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.832
Your pineal gland is
old as shit.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:52.835
It's literally impossible
for you.

01:22:57.173 --> 01:22:59.508
[sighs]

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:04.580
Now, if you were lost in time,

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:09.551
and considering you raised her
and you guys share the same DNA,

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:12.055
let's assume that you would make
the same decision.

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:15.724
What would you do?

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:23.133
[suspenseful music]

01:23:23.166 --> 01:23:25.101
[Dennis sighs]

01:23:28.804 --> 01:23:30.739
I'd leave a message somewhere
permanent.

01:23:34.946 --> 01:23:36.213
[clanks]

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:41.651
[suspenseful music]

01:23:51.162 --> 01:23:53.130
[Steve] Uh, Hawking,

01:23:54.898 --> 01:23:56.167
he, uh...

01:23:58.535 --> 01:24:00.004
What?

01:24:00.037 --> 01:24:02.706
Uh.
[sniffs]

01:24:04.108 --> 01:24:06.609
It's just been... oh man,

01:24:08.212 --> 01:24:10.181
if all this works out, I'll,

01:24:10.214 --> 01:24:12.016
I'll tell you about it someday.

01:24:15.286 --> 01:24:17.887
[exhales]

01:24:20.993 --> 01:24:22.493
This is delicious.

01:24:26.098 --> 01:24:29.633
This dirty, shitty river,

01:24:30.102 --> 01:24:31.203
this beer,

01:24:33.105 --> 01:24:34.272
this time,

01:24:36.241 --> 01:24:37.742
wouldn't change it.

01:24:41.579 --> 01:24:43.982
The clock just...

01:24:44.016 --> 01:24:46.617
keeps tickin' down and
the lower that number gets,

01:24:46.650 --> 01:24:50.588
you realize how fucking amazing
now is.

01:24:54.993 --> 01:24:57.095
The present is a miracle, bruh.

01:24:59.597 --> 01:25:01.233
[sighs]

01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.568
[chuckles]

01:25:06.204 --> 01:25:09.275
That's a pretty shitty,
misspelled,

01:25:09.308 --> 01:25:11.810
unspecific message, huh?

01:25:11.843 --> 01:25:12.979
[Steve] "Allways"?

01:25:16.949 --> 01:25:20.652
Remember that home hospice
call we had a few years back,

01:25:20.685 --> 01:25:22.055
100-year-old woman,

01:25:22.088 --> 01:25:24.923
she had end-stage
kidney disease,

01:25:24.957 --> 01:25:28.094
all those pictures with like
Louis Armstrong and Nina Simone?

01:25:29.895 --> 01:25:31.596
Yeah, I remember that.

01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:33.765
Well, she had this book
on her nightstand.

01:25:35.634 --> 01:25:39.038
Can't remember what it was
called but something like,

01:25:39.072 --> 01:25:42.241
<i>Facing Death with a Smile,</i>
or some bullshit.

01:25:44.977 --> 01:25:47.346
While we were waiting for the
coroner, I thumbed through it,

01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.082
and there's this passage about

01:25:49.115 --> 01:25:51.350
how we're all most likely
to die.

01:25:51.384 --> 01:25:53.618
[Denis] Brianna, she asked me
about that,

01:25:53.652 --> 01:25:56.023
and it's like a third of
us will be prolonged in a bed,

01:25:56.056 --> 01:25:58.825
a third of us will be a sharp
decline in a bed,

01:25:58.858 --> 01:26:01.894
and a third of us will be a
roller coaster of organ failure,

01:26:01.928 --> 01:26:06.766
again, in a bed, being treated,
and the tiniest percentage...

01:26:06.799 --> 01:26:07.968
is sudden death.

01:26:09.203 --> 01:26:11.138
And that's our business, man.
We...

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.640
We're seeing
the exceptional ones.

01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:19.113
That's what you told
your daughter?

01:26:19.146 --> 01:26:20.847
That's the most fucked up...

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.116
- [Steve chuckles]
- [Dennis] No, man, no, no, no.

01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:23.250
[laughs]

01:26:23.283 --> 01:26:26.652
What it made me realize is
that we know how it ends.

01:26:28.422 --> 01:26:30.923
Mystery solved.

01:26:30.958 --> 01:26:32.792
And in death,
the wild cards of fate

01:26:32.825 --> 01:26:35.761
are the exceptional ones.
But in life, all that

01:26:35.795 --> 01:26:38.664
crazy shit that happens before
you die, there's always

01:26:38.698 --> 01:26:40.167
infinite possibilities.

01:26:48.243 --> 01:26:49.910
So, yeah,

01:26:51.845 --> 01:26:54.215
the last thing I ever said
to her as her father

01:26:54.249 --> 01:26:55.984
- was alway...
- [glass shatters]

01:26:58.419 --> 01:27:00.754

- [grunting and gasping]

01:27:29.017 --> 01:27:30.385
Shit, shit!

- Brianna!

01:28:29.012 --> 01:28:33.149

Brianna!

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:38.455
Brianna!

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.796
[explosion]

01:29:08.152 --> 01:29:09.886
Brianna.

01:29:09.919 --> 01:29:12.456
- Brianna.

[dramatic music]

01:29:32.209 --> 01:29:33.277
I need you.

01:29:38.082 --> 01:29:40.384
- [bell chimes]
- [dramatic music]

01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:42.019
Really fucking need you.

- [Brianna] Hello?
- [whimpers]

01:29:58.470 --> 01:29:59.571
[Brianna] Hello?

[groans]

01:30:14.052 --> 01:30:17.189
How did, how did you find me?

01:30:17.222 --> 01:30:19.491
- The message.
- [both panting]

01:30:19.524 --> 01:30:21.593
What? What message?

01:30:25.063 --> 01:30:28.933
Don't worry about it.
Here, take this.

01:30:31.103 --> 01:30:33.305
It's time to go home,
just take it.

01:30:33.338 --> 01:30:35.574
[Steve panting]

01:30:37.609 --> 01:30:40.045

01:30:40.078 --> 01:30:41.480
Where's yours?

01:30:45.551 --> 01:30:47.019
I'm good.

01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:48.988
Come on.

01:30:50.356 --> 01:30:51.657

01:30:54.527 --> 01:30:55.927
Okay.

01:30:56.963 --> 01:30:58.197
Any minute now,

01:30:58.231 --> 01:31:02.402
something from the present is
gonna appear nearby, all right?

01:31:02.435 --> 01:31:04.637
Now, if we're not back
at the boulder

01:31:04.670 --> 01:31:08.508
by the time it disappears,
we'll be stuck here forever.

01:31:09.609 --> 01:31:10.909
Okay?

01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:13.546
Aah!

01:31:13.579 --> 01:31:15.948
- I'll help you across.
- No!

01:31:15.982 --> 01:31:18.718
