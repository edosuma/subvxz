DIARY OF AN EXORCIST

01:45.417 --> 01:48.167
Please, this way, come with me.

02:26.042 --> 02:27.542
Did you feel that, my brother?

02:27.875 --> 02:30.542
I've never felt such strong
and so obscure energy.

02:30.875 --> 02:33.333
- It is happening.
- What is going on?

02:33.583 --> 02:35.708
He was able to cross into our world.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.333
Who are you talking about?

02:39.833 --> 02:42.500
Quick, Father Fabio, take us to her.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.375
Yes, this way.

CHAPTER ONE - THE CASE OF MARIA LÚCIA

02:55.917 --> 02:58.458
From now on it's up to you,
I cannot go on.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.083
Sorry, I cannot!

03:00.625 --> 03:04.042
Look, this is the door that leads
to the tower staircase.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.583
She's up there.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.417
Now, can I go?

03:07.583 --> 03:09.167
- You can.
- Thank you!

03:13.208 --> 03:15.667
- Are you ready?
- Always.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.583
In the name of Jesus,
I command you to leave!

04:25.625 --> 04:28.083
I was waiting for you.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.125
In the name of Jesus,
I command you to leave.

05:32.292 --> 05:34.042
Get out of this body now!

<i>For God's sake, father, help me!</i>

06:00.375 --> 06:03.292
<i>It's him! It's him! It's him...</i>

06:07.125 --> 06:09.250

<i>I have been a priest
specialized in exorcism for 35 years.</i>

06:14.250 --> 06:17.708

Father Lucas?

06:33.750 --> 06:34.958
Hi.

06:35.333 --> 06:39.583
Two young boys are at the gate
and want to talk to you,

06:39.708 --> 06:40.917
they are producing a movie.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.583
You can have them come in, please.

06:42.667 --> 06:45.167
- Of course. One moment, please.
- Please.

06:55.792 --> 06:56.958
<i>Father Lucas!</i>

06:58.667 --> 07:00.292
Father Lucas?

07:01.417 --> 07:04.333
Look, here are the boys I told you about.

07:04.583 --> 07:08.250
I'm sorry, I was kind
of distracted, miles away.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.083
- How are you?
- Are you alright?

07:10.167 --> 07:11.958
Excuse me, please.

07:12.042 --> 07:14.042
Thank you so much for seeing us, Father.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.042
How may I address you?

07:17.167 --> 07:18.458
Your name?

07:18.542 --> 07:21.792
- Sorry, mine is Renan and his is Bruno.
- Bruno.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.292
- Let's sit down, please!
- Excuse me.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.833
Would you like some water, some coffee?

07:30.958 --> 07:32.918
- Yes, I'll have some coffee.
- I want some water.

07:33.042 --> 07:34.458
And you, Priest?

07:34.708 --> 07:36.750
For me nothing, thanks, sister.
Thank you very much.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.125
Then, excuse me.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.625
Yesterday, on the phone,
you told me that you are

07:41.708 --> 07:43.792
producing a film about exorcism.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.375
That's right, Father.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.958
How can I help?

07:47.042 --> 07:49.458
Well, as you already know,

07:49.542 --> 07:51.625
Bruno and I just graduated.

07:51.792 --> 07:53.708
And we're producing a feature film...

07:53.875 --> 07:56.708
But we want to produce something
different, out of the ordinary,

07:56.792 --> 07:59.667
that causes fear in people, a scare!

07:59.833 --> 08:01.268
And that's why we chose the exorcism...

08:01.292 --> 08:04.333
The fact is that we don't want
to do something conventional,

08:04.500 --> 08:08.458
something that has already been done,
we want a real story.

08:08.542 --> 08:12.292
And I believe that such a small
film can turn into a great movie.

08:14.458 --> 08:16.708
So Father, what do you think?

08:16.958 --> 08:18.000
Let's get to work!

08:18.083 --> 08:19.333
- Get to work!
- Of course.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.833
Father, it's very simple, all right?

08:28.292 --> 08:31.750
When you hear "action", you begin
to tell your story, your family,

08:31.833 --> 08:32.832
where you were born.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.167
It's very simple, stay calm!

08:34.375 --> 08:35.417
Perfect.

08:35.542 --> 08:36.542
Action!

08:37.542 --> 08:42.375
I was born in a small town,
called Santa Bárbara das Graças

08:43.417 --> 08:46.750
and it was there that it all began.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.792
<i>Listen, what do you think of,</i>

08:56.917 --> 08:59.250
after breakfast,
riding a bike there in the park?

08:59.375 --> 09:00.500
I'm in, dad.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.309
No, Dad, today I would like
to buy a sweater.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.333
Ah! Daughter!

09:03.417 --> 09:05.417
It was already scheduled, mother!
Let's go, please!

09:05.458 --> 09:07.375
Yes, Paulinha, I'll take you.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.708
Let's do this, kid, before we leave,

09:09.792 --> 09:12.583
- let's check the tire of your bike, okay?
- Okay.

09:12.667 --> 09:17.000
- Mother, put some for me.
- Just a little? It's warm. Is this enough?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.000
Lucas! Son!

09:34.083 --> 09:37.417
Sorry, he did not see you. Are you okay?

09:37.583 --> 09:38.750
- Get away!
- What?

09:38.833 --> 09:40.309
Get away from him.
Get away from this man.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.250
- But he's my father.
- It's not anymore!

09:42.333 --> 09:43.917
- Get away!
- You're crazy!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.750
He's my son, are you crazy?

09:45.875 --> 09:47.515
Do yourself a favor, get out of here, go!

09:47.625 --> 09:49.792
You are crazy, you need help!

09:49.875 --> 09:52.333
Lady, please go, you're crazy!

09:52.500 --> 09:55.875
You've killed your family
since the day you went on that ritual.

09:56.042 --> 09:57.417
What are you talking about?

09:57.708 --> 09:59.292
Who told you that?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.958
Who are you? Huh?

10:01.042 --> 10:02.500
Dad, let's go!
Let's go, dad!

10:02.583 --> 10:05.417
Get out of here, you crazy one!
Come on, son.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.958
But, Julia, no one knows how to
handle that machine like I do,

10:19.125 --> 10:21.333
besides, Jurandir asked me for a favor.

10:21.458 --> 10:22.542
Jurandir!

10:23.208 --> 10:24.542
Why he does not ask Carlos?

10:24.625 --> 10:27.375
I am the supervisor,
I have to meet goals,

10:27.500 --> 10:31.250
besides, I live closer to the factory
and it is easier for me.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.667
Is that what you want? Go.

10:34.042 --> 10:35.750
- My love, I'll arrive...
- Go, Jonas!

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
Damn!

10:49.208 --> 10:52.375
Mom, I'm going to Pedrinho's house
to get a wrench, okay?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.042
- Okay, but don't be late.
- Okay.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.500
The dinner is almost ready.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.417
- Alright, kiss, bye!
- Good bye, son.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.583
Father Jaime, Father Jaime!

11:25.917 --> 11:28.875
Father Jaime. Please, Father Jaime!

11:31.417 --> 11:35.292
Father, Father. For God's sake, help me.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.625
Come on!

11:37.958 --> 11:40.333
Calm! Come on!

11:42.042 --> 11:43.042
Let's go!

11:45.625 --> 11:49.667
Quickly, hurry up to the chapel
and bring my book of rituals, quickly!

12:20.625 --> 12:23.708
<i>He wants to save
every human being.</i>

12:25.375 --> 12:31.625
<i>The God who for the salvation of mankind,
anointed water to the greatest sacraments.</i>

12:31.917 --> 12:36.708
<i>Answer me, my Holy Father,
the groaning of the pleading church</i>

12:36.917 --> 12:40.792
<i>and don't let this son be possessed
by the clutches of the father of lies</i>

12:41.208 --> 12:44.750
<i>and that your servant, redeemed
by the price of the blood of Christ,</i>

12:44.917 --> 12:47.292
<i>be caught in the devil's clutches.</i>

12:47.417 --> 12:52.833
<i>Don't let the temple of your spirit
be inhabited by an unclean spirit.</i>

12:52.917 --> 12:54.625
<i>Oh God! Help me!</i>

13:02.167 --> 13:03.375
Father, is that you?

13:24.958 --> 13:28.250
It looks good,
doesn't it? I wish...

13:29.292 --> 13:32.458
It was about time, boy!

13:33.208 --> 13:34.500
What is wrong, son?

13:36.958 --> 13:39.250
What's wrong? What's that face?

13:39.333 --> 13:40.875
Nothing, I was running.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.833
Well, let's eat.

13:42.917 --> 13:45.917
But before this, let's pray, right?

13:46.125 --> 13:48.333
Let's start.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.208
Thank you, Lord, for this food,

13:53.500 --> 13:57.750
may the Lord keep us
always united and in good health.

13:58.250 --> 14:01.500
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed...

14:03.083 --> 14:05.208
Hey, stay calm!

14:05.292 --> 14:09.000
I'm here, it's okay. Stay calm.

14:09.083 --> 14:12.042
Calm daughter, calm Lucas.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.292
What a scare, man!

14:15.667 --> 14:17.125
It was about time!

14:17.542 --> 14:21.125
Next time sleep outside,
because if you have no regard for me,

14:21.250 --> 14:23.000
have at least to your children.

14:23.500 --> 14:26.417
My love, forgive me.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.542
But I need to protect you.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.583
Protect? What do you mean, Jonas?
Are you drunk, man?

14:33.667 --> 14:37.833
Son, no matter where the soul goes,

14:39.083 --> 14:42.333
the important thing is how it returns.

14:42.917 --> 14:45.250
What is it, man?
What are you talking about?

14:45.958 --> 14:47.000
Jonas, what are you doing?

14:47.083 --> 14:48.292
- Jonas!
- Dad!

14:48.375 --> 14:50.542
Jonas! Jonas, what is this?

14:50.625 --> 14:53.292
Jonas, my love! Don't do it!

14:53.375 --> 14:55.542
Jonas!

16:55.792 --> 16:58.792
- Father Lucas!
- Hi, Eduardo, how are you?

16:58.875 --> 17:00.518
You were in there
and I did not even see you...

17:00.542 --> 17:02.458
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank God!

17:02.542 --> 17:04.643
- What about the seminar?
- Well, it's going very well.

17:04.666 --> 17:08.958
Sorry I came this way in this rush,
but remember your old teacher?

17:09.041 --> 17:10.416
- Father José?
- Yes of course!

17:10.500 --> 17:12.458
He asked me to give you a message.

17:12.708 --> 17:15.500
Wow! Father José, I haven't spoken
with him for two years,

17:15.583 --> 17:16.916
I'm curious, I want to hear.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.791
He did not tell me much, Father Lucas,

17:18.875 --> 17:22.041
just asked me to deliver
this letter to you.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.375
And he said the matter is one
of extreme urgency.

17:24.916 --> 17:26.750
I'll read it and I'll get
in touch with him.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.500
So that's fine, now I need to go.
I'm sorry, I'm late for class.

17:29.583 --> 17:30.684
Go there, I don't want to disturb you.

17:30.708 --> 17:31.828
- God be with you!
- You too.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.167
- May God be with you!
- Goodbye.

17:37.458 --> 17:41.417
SÃO PAULO
NOSSA SENHORA DO Ó DISTRICT

18:05.000 --> 18:06.917
DEAR LUCAS,
BE AT MY HOME TODAY AT 8:00 PM.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.375
FATHER JOSÉ

18:19.958 --> 18:22.292
Look what I booked for us.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.542
You always had good wine.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.542
- I open it and you serve.
- What an honor!

18:28.625 --> 18:31.875
It isn't an honor. These old hands,
I don't trust them too much.

18:32.625 --> 18:35.917
Old man, stop being foolish, Father José!

18:36.458 --> 18:39.458
It's enough for me. It's enough for me.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.750
Father José,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
I know that look.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.333
What look, boy?

18:47.708 --> 18:48.875
I know that look.

18:48.958 --> 18:52.500
Tell me, have you heard
about the Biaggio brothers?

18:52.917 --> 18:54.250
- Biaggio brothers!
- Yeah.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.000
For God's sake, everyone has heard of it.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.417
They are the greatest
exorcist priests still alive.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.500
Exactly!

18:59.542 --> 19:01.458
They have released more than 20 books

19:01.542 --> 19:04.083
about demonic possession,
devilish influence.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.833
Modesty part, I've read all,

19:05.958 --> 19:08.292
and they are very good, excellent.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.208
Father Thomas Biaggio
and Father Pedro Biaggio

19:12.292 --> 19:14.875
they are legends.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.708
Nice this word, legends.

19:17.417 --> 19:20.500
Well, since you know so much
about the Biaggio brothers,

19:20.750 --> 19:24.917
you must know that
the two are considered crazy

19:25.000 --> 19:27.917
- by some and visionaries by others.
- But look...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.958
People within our own church find that.

19:31.042 --> 19:35.000
Yes, but this counterpoint
of opinions came after

19:35.083 --> 19:37.167
- the case of Maria Lúcia.
- Right.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.083
And they had to use the ritual
of the cross, you know...

19:40.167 --> 19:42.875
abolished in the Middle Ages
by the church itself.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.625
- Of course!
- Wait! Wait!

19:44.708 --> 19:47.750
What does this have to do with me,
with my future, with my life?

19:47.875 --> 19:51.167
Everything, everything, Lucas.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.167
Father Pedro Biaggio,

19:54.833 --> 19:59.292
he came to find an apprentice
to replace him, Lucas.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.708
And have they found this apprentice yet?

20:03.167 --> 20:05.667
- I told him about you.
- I see...

20:05.875 --> 20:08.000
And what did he think,
did he say anything?

20:08.125 --> 20:10.750
This morning he was here in my house

20:10.833 --> 20:13.750
to say that he will give
that chance to you, Lucas.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.125
God in heaven! Wait a second!

20:16.458 --> 20:17.458
I...

20:18.458 --> 20:22.458
I always dreamed of meeting the Biaggios
and now I'm going to be

20:22.958 --> 20:25.292
his student, his apprentice,
my God in heaven!

20:25.375 --> 20:28.250
- So, Lucas.
- Wow!

20:29.458 --> 20:31.875
Father José, did he make an appointment?

20:31.958 --> 20:33.318
Is this meeting already scheduled?

20:33.375 --> 20:36.500
- Because I need to prepare myself.
- Calm down, calm down!

20:37.125 --> 20:41.583
He said that as soon as everything
is ready, that is, at the right time,

20:41.667 --> 20:43.333
he will call you himself.

20:43.417 --> 20:44.417
Look...

20:45.250 --> 20:46.750
I don't even know how to thank you.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.708
- No, no!
- I don't know, really.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.792
You don't need to thank me, not me.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.625
Thank God, Lucas.

20:54.750 --> 20:58.458
Always with wise words, my friend, always.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.542
Well, I'll be going.

21:00.625 --> 21:04.917
I think I'm going to let you go,
because I'm tired.

21:06.125 --> 21:08.208
- Good rest.
- Give me a hug.

21:08.292 --> 21:12.208
It was a great pleasure to see you again.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.667
Our talk, our conversations.

21:15.042 --> 21:17.417
Lucas, go with God!

21:33.500 --> 21:34.500
Good evening.

21:38.292 --> 21:39.792
Lady, lady!

21:41.500 --> 21:43.250
Lady, lady, lady. Sorry, sorry! Sorry!

21:43.333 --> 21:47.125
I'm sorry I approached you like this,
but I'm not a thief, okay?

21:47.792 --> 21:50.583
It's just that I don't know
if you'll remember me.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.125
I know who you are.

21:53.708 --> 21:54.833
No, of course!

21:54.917 --> 21:57.500
I am Father Lucas, of the parish...

21:57.583 --> 21:59.292
You are that child...

21:59.917 --> 22:03.333
who bumped into me that day
and that were with that man.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.750
Yes, that man was my father.

22:05.917 --> 22:09.708
- Are you still looking for answers?
- Yes I am, of course!

22:10.000 --> 22:11.958
And if you can help me find them,

22:12.042 --> 22:14.167
I'll be eternally grateful.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.875
I'm glad you became a priest,

22:17.000 --> 22:18.583
clung to God,

22:18.667 --> 22:22.083
because, in the end,
he is the only salvation.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.000
As for your father, I cannot say the same.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.792
But that's just it, my father.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.625
After the day I bumped
into you in the square,

22:30.042 --> 22:32.042
my father came home...

22:33.708 --> 22:36.500
He shot himself in the head
in front of the whole family.

22:36.917 --> 22:37.917
And until today,

22:38.083 --> 22:41.458
I've been looking for answers,
I don't know why he did it.

22:41.542 --> 22:44.333
Father Jaime, already deceased,

22:44.500 --> 22:46.250
without the help of the Vatican,

22:46.375 --> 22:50.292
suspected that he was
possessed by a demon,

22:50.375 --> 22:52.750
called Alus Mabus.

22:53.333 --> 22:55.208
And your father, of course,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.208
in the last act of faith,

22:58.000 --> 22:59.333
did what he did

23:00.292 --> 23:03.875
to save you, not him.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.542
But how do you know all this?

23:05.625 --> 23:06.750
I'm Lúcia,

23:07.250 --> 23:11.625
I worked with Father Jaime for 15 years,
that is the reason.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.542
Oh, I knew!

23:13.958 --> 23:18.125
Look, Mrs. Lúcia, you removed
a gigantic weight off my back.

23:18.208 --> 23:20.500
And I thank you for that.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.500
Deep down, I already knew,

23:23.917 --> 23:25.250
I just needed to listen.

23:26.333 --> 23:28.708
Good, excuse me now.

23:28.792 --> 23:30.833
Mrs. Lúcia, do you live near here?

23:30.917 --> 23:34.542
I live on the other side of the street
with my son, Alberto.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.250
- He's the one who takes care of me.
- Not long ago, right?

23:37.333 --> 23:39.833
Yes, yes, recently.

23:40.208 --> 23:42.667
- Excuse me.
- I make a point of accompanying you.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.500
So let's go.

23:53.750 --> 23:54.750
May God be with you!

23:55.458 --> 23:56.583
With you too.

23:57.417 --> 23:58.542
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.292
Hi! Can I help you?

24:06.042 --> 24:07.875
- Do you live here?
- Yes, I live.

24:08.292 --> 24:10.125
Alberto, son of Mrs. Lúcia?

24:10.208 --> 24:12.000
Alberto, son of Mrs. Lúcia.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.125
My pleasure, Father Lucas.

24:14.292 --> 24:17.000
What's up, Father Lucas?
Have we met before?

24:17.083 --> 24:18.750
Not really,

24:18.875 --> 24:20.875
I just came to accompany
your mother home.

24:20.958 --> 24:22.542
And she told me about you.

24:24.958 --> 24:25.958
What's it?

24:26.875 --> 24:28.292
What kind of joke is this?

24:29.167 --> 24:31.250
No, no, it was not a joke,

24:31.333 --> 24:33.542
I just accompanied your
mother home, that's all.

24:33.625 --> 24:34.667
Is there any problem?

24:34.875 --> 24:37.333
You cannot have accompanied
my mother, it's impossible.

24:37.458 --> 24:38.750
But I accompanied her.

24:40.375 --> 24:43.583
My mother died 15 years ago
in Santa Barbara de Graças.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.333
What do you mean, she died?

24:46.625 --> 24:47.833
My mother died!

24:48.083 --> 24:49.333
But I...

24:51.125 --> 24:53.667
- Wait a minute, priest what?
- It's Father Lucas.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.708
Which Father Lucas, is it some joke?

24:55.792 --> 24:57.432
You're joking, are you here with someone?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.500
No, no. I'm the one who apologizes...

24:59.917 --> 25:01.833
I must have confused.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.601
What do you mean, confused?
You know my name.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.375
Look, Alberto, I've got a lot
of stuff in my mind, lately,

25:06.542 --> 25:07.750
I'm weird, that's it.

25:07.875 --> 25:10.292
Just because you're mad,
you think you can play such a joke!

25:10.375 --> 25:11.583
Sorry, sorry.

25:11.917 --> 25:13.083
No, no, come here!

25:14.417 --> 25:15.458
Excuse me.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.625
<i>You just might be crazy.</i>

25:35.833 --> 25:37.375
<i>What is it, Jonas?</i>

25:37.875 --> 25:40.833
<i>- Why are you like that?
- You're not my wife.</i>

25:41.042 --> 25:43.375
<i>Am I not your wife?
What are you talking about, man?</i>

25:43.458 --> 25:44.500
Bitch.

25:44.583 --> 25:48.083
- Are you crazy? Calm down.
- You're useless!

25:58.042 --> 26:02.250
Lucas, your soul will be mine.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.875
The bastard got me.

26:19.833 --> 26:21.542
He got me.

26:22.375 --> 26:24.333
<i>The bastard got me.</i>

26:27.917 --> 26:28.917
Sir...

26:29.042 --> 26:32.292
The bastard got me, Lucas.

26:32.917 --> 26:34.042
<i>Who got you, Sir?</i>

26:35.833 --> 26:39.000
If you stay, I can help you...

27:27.250 --> 27:30.250
<i>Father!</i>

28:04.458 --> 28:05.458
Ready?

28:05.542 --> 28:08.083
Father Lucas?
This is father Pedro Biaggio.

28:08.292 --> 28:10.125
- Oh, father Pedro!
- Am I disturbing you?

28:10.208 --> 28:12.625
Not at all, not at all...
You're not bothering.

28:12.708 --> 28:15.625
And by the way, I don't know
how to tell you this,

28:15.708 --> 28:17.351
but it seems that it was
transmission of thought,

28:17.375 --> 28:19.917
because I just had a nightmare with you.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I would like to make
an invitation to you,

28:22.333 --> 28:25.750
for an exorcism session today.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.292
Today?

28:27.583 --> 28:28.667
Do you want it or not?

28:28.750 --> 28:30.958
No, no... Of course
I want this opportunity.

28:31.042 --> 28:34.375
So be at my house today,
at 11:00 PM. Sharp.

28:34.458 --> 28:36.458
Okay, 11:00 PM, I’ll be there.

28:36.708 --> 28:39.500
<i>Oh, Father Pedro,
do you want me to bring something?</i>

29:15.500 --> 29:18.042
- Good evening!
- Good evening, is father Pedro home?

29:18.167 --> 29:20.250
- <i>Yes, come in, please!</i>
- Excuse me.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.083
- Father Lucas?
- Yes.

29:23.167 --> 29:24.833
I am the sister Maria Lúcia.

29:25.833 --> 29:29.667
- Sister Maria Lúcia?
- That's me.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.167
Nice to meet you.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.083
Nice to meet you too, Father Lucas.
Come with me, please!

29:39.458 --> 29:43.167
Father Pedro? My pleasure, Father Lucas.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.417
Sorry for the delay,
you know how this city is...

29:46.500 --> 29:47.583
Sit down.

29:48.292 --> 29:49.333
Okay.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.542
First of all, Father Pedro,
I wanted to thank you...

29:55.625 --> 29:59.208
Lucas, I've separated this for you.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.583
- Thank you, Father Pedro, I...
- Open it!

30:12.958 --> 30:15.292
It was blessed by our Holy Pope.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.542
I think it will be very useful.

30:38.542 --> 30:39.750
Shall we?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.958
Lucas, I'm going to give you absolution.

31:03.833 --> 31:06.625
I absolve you,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

31:06.708 --> 31:10.167
of all the sins you have committed
in the past.

31:10.333 --> 31:14.792
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.417
Amen.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.583
Amen.

31:18.375 --> 31:19.375
Let's go.

31:28.083 --> 31:29.125
Lucas...

31:30.083 --> 31:31.833
What you're going to see inside there...

31:32.875 --> 31:34.750
it will change your life forever.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.333
Do you want to continue?

32:06.750 --> 32:08.125
Just one more thing...

32:09.917 --> 32:11.958
Don't speak directly to him.

32:13.125 --> 32:18.500
It is the devil, it's deceptive
and will try to confuse you.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.125
Alright, Father.

33:01.292 --> 33:03.083
In the name of Christ,

33:03.875 --> 33:05.667
I command you, demon,

33:07.542 --> 33:08.958
reveal yourself!

33:22.958 --> 33:24.583
Father Pedro! Father Pedro!

33:31.750 --> 33:34.083
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to stop!

33:37.417 --> 33:40.042
By Saint Michael,
prince of the heavenly militia!

33:42.375 --> 33:45.375
I command you,
I cast you out of this body now!

34:06.167 --> 34:09.417
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command you to leave this body now!

34:09.500 --> 34:11.976
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command in the name of the Virgin Mary.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.083
You're going to rot
in hell with your father.

34:16.542 --> 34:19.750
Hail Mary, grace, the Lord is with you.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.583
Blessed are you among women,

34:21.708 --> 34:23.500
blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.583
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

34:26.667 --> 34:29.333
now and in the hour, of our death, Amen.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.875
In the name of St. Michael the Archangel,

34:31.958 --> 34:33.458
prince of the heavenly militia,

34:33.542 --> 34:35.750
I order you to speak your name now!

34:35.917 --> 34:37.792
Say your name now, demon!

34:38.042 --> 34:39.042
Say your...

34:39.083 --> 34:41.083
Avalon!

34:41.167 --> 34:43.000
I cast you out!

34:53.125 --> 34:54.875
Oh, my God of Heaven, father Pedro!

34:55.000 --> 34:57.292
Father Pedro! Father Pedro!

34:58.458 --> 34:59.500
Father Pedro.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.042
Father Pedro...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.833
Don't do this to me, Father Pedro!

35:05.375 --> 35:06.417
Father Pedro!

35:09.125 --> 35:10.208
Father Pedro.

35:12.750 --> 35:13.833
Father Pedro!

35:14.792 --> 35:16.000
Father Pedro.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.833
Don't do this to me.

35:30.833 --> 35:32.750
In the name of Jesus Christ,

35:35.125 --> 35:40.667
I absolve you of all your sins
that you have committed in the past.

35:43.083 --> 35:44.500
In the name of the Father,

35:45.042 --> 35:48.167
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.042
Go in peace, my friend.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.667
BIAGGIO FAMILY
FATHER PEDRO BIAGGIO

36:53.958 --> 36:56.167
Father Lucas Vidal, I presume?

36:56.250 --> 36:57.250
Yes, it's me.

36:57.958 --> 37:01.167
Father Thomas Biaggio,
brother of Father Pedro.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.708
My pleasure, Father Thomas,

37:03.417 --> 37:05.542
it's a pity that in these circumstances...

37:05.625 --> 37:07.833
- May God have him in a good place!
- Yes.

37:08.708 --> 37:11.417
Could you tell me how it happened?

37:11.542 --> 37:14.833
- Yes, of course, Father Thomas...
- Let's take a walk.

37:16.750 --> 37:18.375
So, Father Thomas,

37:18.625 --> 37:22.458
everything happened very fast
and I knew very little of your brother.

37:22.917 --> 37:25.000
I don't know if you know,
but your brother was making

37:25.083 --> 37:28.292
a selection of priests
and I was this selected priest.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.458
After a couple of days,

37:31.000 --> 37:32.250
your brother called me.

37:32.375 --> 37:35.500
I went to his house
to help him in an exorcism.

37:35.583 --> 37:38.375
I was very happy and, of course, I went.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.958
When we entered in the exorcism room,

37:40.042 --> 37:41.750
your brother began the ritual.

37:41.958 --> 37:45.917
There was a woman tied there,
apparently in her early 40s.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.625
And when he began the ritual,
she was very elated,

37:48.708 --> 37:51.208
talking horrible words and suddenly

37:51.292 --> 37:53.875
she stiffened and attacked us.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.583
You already know the end of this story...

37:57.125 --> 37:59.125
Father Thomas, I swear,

37:59.542 --> 38:01.500
I did everything to save your brother,

38:01.625 --> 38:02.750
I did what I could...

38:02.917 --> 38:04.417
But I could not,

38:04.500 --> 38:07.042
I think he made a bad choice.

38:07.125 --> 38:09.083
I didn't feel prepared... I think...

38:09.167 --> 38:10.458
So I must conclude,

38:10.875 --> 38:12.417
that in this moment of terror

38:12.833 --> 38:15.125
you have taken my brother's place

38:15.333 --> 38:17.292
and without practice,

38:17.417 --> 38:19.167
exorcised the girl. Was that it?

38:19.250 --> 38:21.059
Yes, that was it,
in the midst of all confusion

38:21.083 --> 38:22.684
I don't even know how it happened,
I don't even know...

38:22.708 --> 38:24.792
Father Lucas, my son...

38:25.708 --> 38:29.167
You ask me why my brother chose you,

38:29.250 --> 38:31.667
because he, as I, have seen in you,

38:31.917 --> 38:34.125
exceptional qualities to replace him.

38:34.208 --> 38:36.750
I still keep thinking that...

38:36.833 --> 38:40.333
Rest assured, I will continue
the work of my brother,

38:40.625 --> 38:43.125
I will teach you the practice of exorcism.

38:44.208 --> 38:48.750
I am very thankful,
thank you, Father Thomas.

38:48.833 --> 38:50.292
But first, Father Lucas,

38:50.458 --> 38:53.167
I really need to know if you're prepared

38:53.250 --> 38:54.667
to take on this new life.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.750
Yes, Father Thomas, I am prepared.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.458
- Well, let's go.
- C'mon, c'mon.

39:01.917 --> 39:04.917
As for your book, Sister Maria Lúcia...

39:30.583 --> 39:31.583
Love?

39:39.375 --> 39:40.375
My love?

39:41.750 --> 39:42.750
Love!

39:48.583 --> 39:49.583
<i>Paula?</i>

40:01.333 --> 40:02.333
Paula?

40:04.708 --> 40:05.750
Paula!

40:11.083 --> 40:12.167
Paula!

40:12.708 --> 40:13.875
<i>Paula?</i>

40:15.625 --> 40:16.708
Paula!

40:18.000 --> 40:19.250
What is going on?

40:20.333 --> 40:22.917
Cover yourself, my love,
let's go inside with me.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
Come with me!

40:24.042 --> 40:25.875
What's happening with you? My God!

40:27.292 --> 40:28.625
Love? What is it?

40:31.167 --> 40:32.208
Paula?

40:32.958 --> 40:33.958
Paula!

40:49.708 --> 40:52.250
Leave me!
Get off me, you slut!

40:52.333 --> 40:54.667
Bitch!

40:54.833 --> 40:56.167
I hate you!

40:57.292 --> 40:59.583
<i>Roberto, bring Lucas!</i>

41:00.167 --> 41:01.917
Call Lucas, Roberto!

41:02.375 --> 41:04.792
- Call Lucas!
- All right, I'll get Lucas.

41:04.917 --> 41:08.833
So go ahead, for God's sake!
My daughter, calm down.

41:08.917 --> 41:10.250
Oh my God!

41:11.500 --> 41:12.500
Wait, I'll be right back.

41:12.583 --> 41:14.167
Thank God! Calm down.

41:15.417 --> 41:16.750
Thank God.

41:26.167 --> 41:29.833
SÃO PAULO
NOSSA SENHORA DO Ó PARISH

41:56.958 --> 41:57.958
Roberto?

42:00.375 --> 42:02.250
What a wonderful surprise!

42:02.333 --> 42:04.500
It's good to meet you here,
my brother-in-law.

42:04.667 --> 42:08.625
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

42:08.750 --> 42:10.059
Do you have a moment to talk to me?

42:10.083 --> 42:12.000
I'm going to pray at mass in 40 minutes,

42:12.125 --> 42:14.042
but let's sit here, come here.

42:17.250 --> 42:18.708
Thank God, my brother-in-law!

42:18.958 --> 42:22.750
Look, I'm really scared, really scared!

42:22.875 --> 42:24.000
Calm down, afraid of what?

42:25.042 --> 42:28.500
It's your sister, I'm afraid
of losing my wife, Father.

42:28.583 --> 42:30.500
What happened to Paula, Roberto?

42:30.708 --> 42:33.083
Paula. She is not well.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.417
Oh my God, I don't even
know how to say it to you...

42:36.500 --> 42:38.260
- Speak, Roberto.
- We think she's possessed.

42:39.542 --> 42:40.708
Possessed?

42:40.792 --> 42:42.458
How "possessed", possessed by whom?

42:42.542 --> 42:43.583
By the devil!

42:45.292 --> 42:50.375
Is it some kind of joke, Roberto?
Because if it is, it is very bad taste.

42:50.833 --> 42:52.125
Who said such an absurdity?

42:52.250 --> 42:54.375
- We came to that conclusion.
- We who?

42:54.458 --> 42:56.625
Me, your mother, your cousins...

42:56.875 --> 42:58.583
In fact, the whole city thinks so.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.000
The whole city went crazy, right?

43:01.083 --> 43:03.333
My sister was always a God-fearing woman,

43:03.417 --> 43:06.167
a woman of prayer,
a woman of great faith.

43:07.042 --> 43:09.583
Have you ever tried to take her
to a hospital, to a doctor?

43:09.708 --> 43:14.083
Yes, Lucas, we took her
to every doctor of the region.

43:14.167 --> 43:16.792
She went through
two specialists, two psychiatrists

43:16.875 --> 43:19.417
and nobody could
find anything in her.

43:19.542 --> 43:24.208
Lucas, I know my wife,
I know she's a woman of faith,

43:24.292 --> 43:26.875
a battling woman with iron health,
but now...

43:28.000 --> 43:29.250
Now she has changed!

43:29.917 --> 43:32.500
She does not stop calling
a priest's name, all night,

43:32.625 --> 43:34.465
she shouts the name of this priest.
It's scary.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.226
Do you know the name of this priest?

43:36.250 --> 43:38.792
Sorry, Lucas, I will not remember now,

43:39.542 --> 43:41.917
but your mother
has jotted it down at home.

43:44.667 --> 43:47.000
- Lucas, are you okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

43:47.083 --> 43:49.042
Roberto, I'm going to do this...

43:49.625 --> 43:51.185
I'm going to talk to Father Armênio now

43:51.250 --> 43:53.018
and I'm going to ask him
to replace me in the mass

43:53.042 --> 43:54.375
for now and tomorrow's mass.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.208
- Are you by car?
- No, I come by bus.

43:56.292 --> 43:59.042
You go with me then, just give me
a minute to change my cassock

43:59.167 --> 44:00.208
and get my things.

44:00.292 --> 44:02.012
- Okay, I'll keep praying back here.
- Okay.

44:02.125 --> 44:03.125
Thank you.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.750
Oh my God!

44:10.458 --> 44:12.250
Everything will be fine.

44:13.250 --> 44:14.708
<i>Tia Clara, Ana Júlia.</i>

44:14.792 --> 44:18.000
<i>- Hi, how are you, Roberto?
- Alright, dear?</i>

44:19.583 --> 44:22.167
Look who is here, it was hard,
but I could do it.

44:22.250 --> 44:25.292
- Is everything okay, auntie?
- It's good to see you, my nephew.

44:25.375 --> 44:26.750
Nice! Nice!

44:27.292 --> 44:28.750
- Hi, mother.
- Hi, my son.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.958
- How are you?
- I miss you.

44:32.042 --> 44:34.375
Me too. And cousin, how are you?

44:35.667 --> 44:38.208
How do you do? What's going on, mother?

44:38.333 --> 44:39.917
I'm not well, my son.

44:40.333 --> 44:43.292
I am afraid, that what is happening
to your sister,

44:43.542 --> 44:45.583
is the same thing that
happened to your father.

44:45.667 --> 44:48.667
Mother, stay calm, okay?
Everything will be all right!

44:48.833 --> 44:50.583
Paulinha, she is sick.

44:50.667 --> 44:52.583
She is need of medical treatment,

44:53.167 --> 44:55.375
sometimes it may even
be schizophrenia, mother.

44:55.458 --> 44:57.583
No, no, it's nothing like that!

44:57.708 --> 44:59.375
I saw in her gaze,

44:59.458 --> 45:02.292
it's the same look
your father had when he died.

45:04.167 --> 45:05.750
Mother, I'll do the following,

45:05.833 --> 45:08.083
I'll go and talk to Paulinha, okay?

45:08.250 --> 45:10.875
And if that is the picture
you are describing,

45:10.958 --> 45:13.292
if it is, I'll take action, alright?

45:13.417 --> 45:14.542
That's good, my son.

45:15.083 --> 45:16.250
So, I'll go there.

45:17.583 --> 45:19.583
- Lucas, one moment, my nephew.
- Hi, aunt.

45:20.167 --> 45:22.417
Please, take this Bible.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.333
No, no, aunt,
I don't think that's necessary.

45:25.542 --> 45:27.417
But take the Bible, take it.

45:27.542 --> 45:29.583
I'm going to take it because
you're asking, okay?

45:30.792 --> 45:32.125
If you want to join me.

45:32.292 --> 45:34.250
Thank you. Come on.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.625
Alright, my little sister?

45:51.500 --> 45:52.625
My brother.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.750
No need to get up, I will go there.

45:58.792 --> 46:00.500
How are you? All right?

46:00.958 --> 46:02.958
Glad you came, my brother.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.875
So... Paulinha, I wanted to ask,
what are you feeling?

46:07.000 --> 46:08.268
I wanted you to tell me straight

46:08.292 --> 46:09.852
because I need to talk to the doctor...

46:09.917 --> 46:11.208
I don't know what to say.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.458
They see things,

46:13.542 --> 46:15.667
speak things I did that I don't know.

46:16.042 --> 46:17.333
I don't remember.

46:17.542 --> 46:19.417
How so? Don't you remember anything?

46:20.542 --> 46:21.667
Make an effort.

46:21.750 --> 46:23.375
- No, nothing!
- Nothing, nothing?

46:23.750 --> 46:25.625
And so, when you return
from these trances...

46:25.708 --> 46:29.292
Do you feel anything, any pain?

46:29.375 --> 46:32.000
When I wake up, my body is all aching,

46:32.625 --> 46:34.708
it seems like I got beaten up,
I don't know.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.333
She beats herself,

46:37.000 --> 46:39.625
or rather, this thing
that is inside of it.

46:39.708 --> 46:40.708
Mother!

46:44.917 --> 46:46.458
So my sister, what else?

46:46.833 --> 46:50.000
I also feel weak, lack of appetite,

46:50.708 --> 46:52.667
that's all I remember.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.625
Okay, let me just take a look here.

46:59.500 --> 47:00.625
You are going to be good.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.125
See, mother,

47:09.750 --> 47:11.167
lack of appetite,

47:11.625 --> 47:13.750
weakness, she is anemic!

47:15.083 --> 47:18.292
I'll go straight to the doctor,
I don't care, I'll talk to...

47:18.375 --> 47:20.833
How easy it is to deceive this priest!

47:25.917 --> 47:28.542
Paula, did you say something?

47:29.375 --> 47:30.500
I did not say anything.

47:31.917 --> 47:34.542
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I said nothing.

47:35.667 --> 47:36.708
My brother,

47:37.083 --> 47:38.667
I love you so much,

47:40.292 --> 47:41.458
I love so much!

47:43.458 --> 47:44.500
I love you too!

47:45.958 --> 47:47.000
You know, Paulinha,

47:47.875 --> 47:50.208
when you were talking,
I remembered one thing.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.792
Remember when we were kids...

47:54.958 --> 47:57.750
And you used to read to me?

47:58.875 --> 48:00.875
Especially on the nights I was scared,

48:01.042 --> 48:04.375
then you would open
the Bible and read a psalm.

48:05.208 --> 48:08.833
You know, I remember I was so relieved,

48:09.042 --> 48:10.500
my sleep became so calm.

48:11.708 --> 48:13.333
That's when I thought about it...

48:13.458 --> 48:16.333
Why don't we repeat that?

48:18.625 --> 48:21.833
Look, I remember your favorite psalm,

48:22.125 --> 48:23.167
psalm 30.

48:23.750 --> 48:25.710
I think you would not even
need to read it, right?

48:26.792 --> 48:29.625
You already have it by heart, don't you?

48:31.833 --> 48:35.125
I take refuge with you, Lord.

48:36.000 --> 48:40.208
Don't be confounded forever,
by Your justice.

48:46.375 --> 48:51.000
Your useless pigs,
you brought me the wrong priest,

48:51.083 --> 48:54.375
I asked for a real priest
and not this fret,

48:54.500 --> 48:56.667
this project of priest.

48:56.792 --> 48:58.667
May I ask what priest
are you looking for?

48:58.792 --> 49:03.708
You know him well,
his name is Samoht Oiggaib!

49:03.792 --> 49:07.167
I don't know any priest by this name.
You're bluffing! Guys!

49:07.250 --> 49:09.490
Don't pay attention to it,
it will try to confuse people,

49:09.542 --> 49:11.750
I need you to begin to pray Our Father,

49:11.833 --> 49:14.208
Hail Mary without stopping, now!
Do as I requested.

49:14.375 --> 49:16.000
Rodolfo, get the sedative.

49:19.208 --> 49:23.042
Petulant father, you bastard!

49:23.375 --> 49:25.375
Do you think you have power over me?

49:26.333 --> 49:28.000
Do you think I'm joking?

49:28.333 --> 49:31.875
So you think you're going to get
into my resting place like this

49:32.000 --> 49:33.250
and challenge me?

49:33.375 --> 49:34.875
Without a stole,

49:35.083 --> 49:36.583
without holy water,

49:36.958 --> 49:39.583
only with a little Bible?

49:42.625 --> 49:44.500
Worm, son of a cow!

49:44.583 --> 49:46.583
You who inhabit the shadows
of the Almighty!

49:50.417 --> 49:52.708
<i>My God!</i>

50:09.500 --> 50:13.542
Leave my family alone, stop!

50:16.458 --> 50:18.542
<i>Leave my family alone, you bastard!</i>

50:18.625 --> 50:20.750
<i>Go Rodolfo, now, go!</i>

50:39.917 --> 50:41.958
Now you believe in your mother?

50:42.833 --> 50:45.250
Sorry, mom, sorry!

50:45.333 --> 50:49.500
Take it easy, take it easy,
my son, a lot of faith in God,

50:49.708 --> 50:54.333
have faith in God, only He can
help you to save your sister.

50:54.958 --> 50:57.083
Take it easy, calm down!

51:02.250 --> 51:03.292
Thank you, aunt!

51:03.417 --> 51:06.083
You’re welcome, my dear, stay with God!

51:09.125 --> 51:12.042
Roberto, do you take
my mother to Auntie's?

51:12.125 --> 51:13.542
Of course, of course!

51:15.500 --> 51:17.458
Then I'll need you again, okay?

51:19.083 --> 51:20.750
- Thank you!
- You're welcome, you know.

51:22.208 --> 51:25.333
Bye mother, go with God, okay?

51:27.625 --> 51:29.083
- <i>I'll be right back.</i>
- Okay.

51:44.792 --> 51:46.333
- Hello?
- Hi, sister Maria Lúcia,

51:46.417 --> 51:47.958
Father Lucas here,

51:48.292 --> 51:51.125
I need to speak with Father Thomas,
it's urgent. Is he there?

51:51.208 --> 51:52.833
He is not here, he traveled.

51:53.750 --> 51:55.270
"Traveled", how so? Traveled to where?

51:55.333 --> 51:56.917
To Santa Barbara das Graças.

51:58.000 --> 52:01.500
But how can this be possible...

52:01.583 --> 52:04.375
<i>Have faith and trust in God's plan.</i>

52:05.542 --> 52:07.000
See you later, Father Lucas.

53:05.875 --> 53:07.250
Who is it?

53:07.375 --> 53:10.583
Thomas Biaggio,
I'm looking for Father Lucas.

53:11.375 --> 53:12.375
Yes, of course.

53:17.417 --> 53:18.417
Over here, please!

53:18.500 --> 53:20.292
I came to help your wife.

53:23.833 --> 53:24.833
Please.

53:31.917 --> 53:34.125
- Are you okay, Father Thomas?
- It's all right.

53:34.958 --> 53:37.917
I don't even know where
to start, it happened...

53:38.000 --> 53:40.333
Why don't you start with the problem?

53:40.458 --> 53:41.542
Your sister.

53:41.958 --> 53:45.125
My sister, she, or this thing
that is possessing her,

53:46.583 --> 53:49.750
is calling a name,
a name of a priest,

53:50.500 --> 53:52.500
is Samoht Oiggaib.

53:53.292 --> 53:55.250
<i>Samoht Oiggaib.</i>

53:55.417 --> 53:58.458
And it turns out I don't
know any priest by that name.

53:59.750 --> 54:01.125
Yes, you know.

54:01.542 --> 54:03.583
Could you get a paper and a pen

54:03.708 --> 54:06.542
and write the name of this
priest in very large letters.

54:06.625 --> 54:08.625
- Yes.
- I'll get it!

54:23.833 --> 54:29.542
Now, please, reverse the paper
and read from left to right.

54:36.875 --> 54:39.167
Thomas Biaggio...

54:39.417 --> 54:42.708
It's me, Father Lucas, he wants me.

54:43.042 --> 54:44.958
<i>Usually, the demons</i>

54:45.167 --> 54:48.417
invert the name of
the people they want to curse.

54:48.500 --> 54:50.417
I just cannot understand why my sister.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.851
My sister was always a woman of faith...

54:51.875 --> 54:55.042
That was the easiest way
for him to reach me.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.625
I still don't understand, Father.

54:56.708 --> 54:58.875
Do you remember the story
of sister Maria Lúcia?

54:59.000 --> 55:00.542
Yes, of course.

55:00.625 --> 55:02.083
Yeah, he's back!

55:02.542 --> 55:03.542
Oh my God.

55:03.625 --> 55:05.542
Is your sister tied up?

55:05.625 --> 55:08.583
- Yes, she is. She's sedated.
- I sedated her.

55:08.667 --> 55:10.042
She's tied too, pretty safe.

55:10.167 --> 55:15.083
I'm going to get my vestments
and we'll start the ritual soon.

55:15.167 --> 55:16.333
As you wish, of course.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.583
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

55:24.250 --> 55:25.667
Roberto, how's our sedative?

55:25.750 --> 55:26.792
Do you still have it?

55:28.250 --> 55:29.726
There's just one more set up,
my brother-in-law.

55:29.750 --> 55:31.710
We need to call Rodolfo
and ask him to bring more,

55:31.750 --> 55:33.559
because if we need in there,
how are we going to stay?

55:33.583 --> 55:35.875
Don't worry, I met him on the way.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.083
He said he was going
to the ambulatory to get more.

55:38.208 --> 55:39.208
Well, thank God!

55:39.250 --> 55:41.476
I just think it's going to take
a while, this clinic is far.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.809
Well, at least he is on the way, right?
Prevention is best.

55:43.833 --> 55:44.875
Sure.

55:46.875 --> 55:48.417
This way, please, Father.

56:28.750 --> 56:33.417
That's the prayer here. Thank you.

56:34.542 --> 56:35.917
In the name of the Father,

56:36.000 --> 56:38.625
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

56:38.708 --> 56:40.208
- Amen!
- Amen!

56:42.917 --> 56:46.750
I hide you, ancient enemy
of the human being.

56:47.208 --> 56:49.708
Get away from this creature of God.

56:50.542 --> 56:53.625
Jesus Christ, with his humility,
overcame your pride.

56:53.750 --> 56:56.167
Your liberality prostrated your envy.

56:56.250 --> 56:58.875
And his meekness,
he hath crushed thy wickedness.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.000
In the name of Jesus and the Virgin Mary.

57:01.083 --> 57:03.833
I have long waited for this reunion,

57:03.917 --> 57:05.417
Father Thomas.

57:06.458 --> 57:10.042
- What do you want from me?
- Live among you.

57:10.125 --> 57:14.292
It'll never happen, I'm here to stop you.

57:14.375 --> 57:16.208
Until when, my old friend?

57:16.750 --> 57:19.458
Your time in this world is running out.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.667
You're weak.

57:22.250 --> 57:25.583
The power of God no longer
shines in you as before.

57:25.667 --> 57:28.750
- I can feel.
- That's where you make a mistake.

57:29.292 --> 57:33.083
I've already expelled you once,
I'll expel you again.

57:33.417 --> 57:34.750
And when I die,

57:34.833 --> 57:37.333
other priests will come to replace me.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.708
And who will replace you?

57:45.500 --> 57:47.167
My little brother?

57:48.083 --> 57:49.458
My brother.

57:49.833 --> 57:50.958
My brother.

57:51.292 --> 57:52.833
Let go of me, my brother.

57:53.500 --> 57:55.042
Help.

57:55.333 --> 57:58.083
Oh, it hurts.

57:58.958 --> 58:01.625
Resist. Be strong.

58:07.125 --> 58:09.083
Come here, come yummy!

58:09.542 --> 58:11.583
Come fuck your little sister, come!

58:11.708 --> 58:13.667
Come here, come!

58:13.958 --> 58:15.750
- Come in here...
- Enough!

58:16.417 --> 58:17.500
Shut up!

58:17.667 --> 58:18.958
Filthy spirit.

58:20.125 --> 58:23.917
And don't keep this handmaid of God
from blessing and praising the Lord.

58:24.208 --> 58:28.042
Come out, you unclean spirit.
And give place to the Holy Spirit.

58:28.125 --> 58:29.792
- Get back!
- Fuck me.

58:29.875 --> 58:31.583
From church prayer.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.333
Remove yourself, you damn dragon.

58:33.708 --> 58:34.708
Take it off.

58:34.875 --> 58:36.208
In the name of Yahweh.

58:36.292 --> 58:37.292
I order!

58:37.375 --> 58:38.750
Get away!

58:38.833 --> 58:40.750
You don't know who I am.

58:40.833 --> 58:43.958
I am the disdain of Christ,
who came to inhabit this Earth.

58:44.125 --> 58:47.333
My name among you is Mabus.

58:48.083 --> 58:52.167
I will take millions of sheep
from Christ's flock to hell.

58:52.250 --> 58:53.958
No!

58:55.542 --> 58:57.667
King of all nations.

58:57.917 --> 58:59.208
My Lord!

58:59.333 --> 59:01.750
Yahweh, gives me your strength!

59:02.167 --> 59:04.083
Go out, demon!

59:04.333 --> 59:05.708
I cast you out.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.917
Go out, demon!

59:11.000 --> 59:13.458
Go back to hell!

59:27.458 --> 59:28.792
My brother!

59:37.125 --> 59:38.333
You came back?

59:39.750 --> 59:41.875
My brother!

59:43.458 --> 59:44.708
<i>She's safe.</i>

59:45.750 --> 59:46.750
Father Thomas.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.292
We did it.

59:48.958 --> 59:50.000
You did it.

59:52.333 --> 59:54.625
We did it. What's it?

59:55.583 --> 59:56.750
No!

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.000
<i>My God!</i>

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:18.792
<i>Paula. Paula!</i>

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:20.417
<i>Paula, where are you?</i>

01:00:20.792 --> 01:00:21.792
<i>Father Thomas.</i>

01:00:21.917 --> 01:00:22.958
<i>Father Thomas!</i>

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:24.542
<i>Oh my God.</i>

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:41.542
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:57.000
Roberto?

01:00:58.333 --> 01:00:59.375
Roberto?

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:14.292
Father Thomas!

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.292
Father Thomas!

01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:19.708
Father Thomas!

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:21.875
Father Thomas! Are you okay?

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:23.000
Are you okay?

01:01:23.417 --> 01:01:24.458
I'm fine.

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:25.583
I am fine!

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:28.125
Go after him.

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:30.667
I cannot do it without you.
I cannot do it without you!

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:31.958
Yes, you can!

01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:33.500
I don't have the strength anymore.

01:01:33.583 --> 01:01:35.958
Go! It can be very dangerous.

01:01:36.042 --> 01:01:38.958
- Careful, my brother! Watch out!
- Go on, quickly! Quickly.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:40.292
Watch out!

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:41.667
Let me release you.

01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:59.708
What happened here?

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.417
You are...

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:02.625
It's the priest's cousin...

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.542
- From Father Lucas?
- Yes, it's me!

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:05.708
Run after him.

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:09.500
He urgently needs this sedative, go fast!

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:10.958
Okay. I'll go.

01:02:11.042 --> 01:02:13.250
Lucas! Lucas...

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:25.833
<i>Father Lucas!</i>

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.167
Roberto, is that you?

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.000
Roberto?

01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:54.417
Roberto?

01:03:11.917 --> 01:03:14.958
Rodolfo, my God.

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:19.500
Cousin, wake up, look at me.

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:21.167
Wake up, for Christ's sake, wake up.

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:22.708
Please, don't do this to me.

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:41.125
Oh my God! Give me strength...

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.208
Oh, my Lord Jesus!

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:53.750
The cross of the Lord is my light.

01:05:25.333 --> 01:05:27.125
The cross of the Lord is my light.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.875
Don't be the dragon my guide.

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.583
Never advise me for vain things.

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:33.750
It's bad what you offer me.

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.000
Remove yourself from Satan!

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:37.208
<i>Son!</i>

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:40.750
How long!

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:42.583
Father!

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:46.250
I had to die for you.

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:48.375
No!

01:05:49.458 --> 01:05:52.083
No, you're not my father.
You are not my father. You are not...

01:05:52.667 --> 01:05:53.792
<i>I love you!</i>

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:59.458
Come with me, son. Come.

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:08.667
I love you! Come.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:10.583
No...

01:06:10.917 --> 01:06:13.667
No! You are not my father.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:15.458
It's me, son.

01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:18.250
- You're the father of lies.
- No.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.167
Get away from me, Satan!

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.750
Get away, Satan!

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:28.125
In the name of the Virgin Mary
and St. Michael the Archangel.

01:06:28.208 --> 01:06:31.292
I order! Remove yourself, Satan!

01:06:31.417 --> 01:06:32.750
Through the blood of the Lamb,

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:35.000
you have redeemed the world
with Your sacrifice,

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:39.208
I command, in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:06:53.167 --> 01:06:55.167
TWO MONTHS LATER
NOSSA SENHORA DO Ó - PARISH

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:57.875
<i>- Hail Mary...
- Full of Grace!</i>

01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:00.042
<i>The Lord is with you.</i>

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.458
<i>Blessed are you among women.</i>

01:07:03.625 --> 01:07:06.708
<i>Blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.</i>

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:09.208
<i>Holly Mary, mother of god.</i>

01:07:09.333 --> 01:07:11.583
<i>Pray for us, sinners.</i>

01:07:11.667 --> 01:07:14.750
<i>Now and at the hour of our death.</i>

01:07:14.833 --> 01:07:16.292
- <i>Amen!</i>
- Thank you.

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:25.875
- May the Lord be with you!
- He is between us!

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:28.250
Bless them all, almighty God.

01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:32.500
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:33.750
Amen.

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:36.833
Go in peace. May the Lord be with you!

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:38.542
<i>Thank God!</i>

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.000
I want to tell you something new.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:04.458
I was invited to pray
a mass in Aparecida do Norte.

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:06.417
Wonderful. When will it be?

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:07.542
Next Sunday.

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:11.792
Very well, it will coincide,
because I'm going to the Vatican,

01:08:11.875 --> 01:08:14.125
I'm going to have to spend
a month there on duty...

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:15.458
- Excuse me?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:08:15.542 --> 01:08:18.542
Sorry to interrupt the conversation.
Are you Father Thomas Biaggio?

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:19.625
Yes, I am!

01:08:19.707 --> 01:08:21.268
Hi, priest, I'm very pleased
to talk to you.

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:23.667
Thank you very much!
The pleasure is mine.

01:08:23.750 --> 01:08:26.707
I am a photographer here in the region
and also in the parish.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.082
I've been following some
of your work for some time.

01:08:29.207 --> 01:08:30.750
How wonderful! What is your name?

01:08:30.875 --> 01:08:34.042
- My name is Erick.
- This is Father Lucas.

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:35.500
- Hi, Father Lucas.
- How are you?

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:37.417
- Pleasure.
- It's my pleasure.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.707
We can take a picture, then...

01:08:39.792 --> 01:08:40.792
Would be great!

01:08:40.875 --> 01:08:43.100
Even because I want to take
a picture of you to the Vatican.

01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.667
I want to introduce you there.

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.667
Just a second.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.167
Just one more.

01:08:54.082 --> 01:08:55.667
Ready, it was great!

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.542
Wonderful, thank you!

01:08:57.957 --> 01:09:01.000
Would you be able to arrange me a copy?

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:02.684
Only you can give me your
contact, your address...

01:09:02.707 --> 01:09:06.332
Please give me
a paper so I give you my address.

01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:08.082
I must have it here.

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.082
Thank you very much!

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:11.475
- It's Erick, right?
- You’re right.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.582
Do you know Father José
from Nossa Senhora do Ó?

01:09:13.667 --> 01:09:14.893
Yes, I've known for a long time.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.707
When you meet him, say that you
met with Father Lucas Vidal.

01:09:17.792 --> 01:09:20.250
You can let me give you the
message, yes. Don't worry!

01:09:20.707 --> 01:09:23.042
Look here, Father Thomas Biaggio,

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.292
my address and phone number
if you need anything...

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:27.457
Great!

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:29.500
- It was a tremendous pleasure.
- My pleasure!

01:09:29.582 --> 01:09:31.475
- May god be with you.
- Again, it was a great pleasure.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.750
God bless you.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:35.082
And you can let me give the
message to the priest, yes.

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:37.250
- Thank you very much.
- Bye bye.

01:09:37.332 --> 01:09:38.500
Excuse me.

01:09:39.417 --> 01:09:40.875
But back to the subject...

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:43.542
It's what I said, we have to...

01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.750
Sister Lúcia!

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:12.708
You almost gave me a heart attack!

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:16.208
Sorry, Father Thomas.
Your correspondence has arrived.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.476
These are the pictures
that photographer took

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.208
of me and Father Lucas at the pizzeria.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.017
Do you want me to bring your coffee now?

01:11:29.083 --> 01:11:30.917
No, thank you very much. Just later.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:32.667
Excuse me.

01:12:02.083 --> 01:12:03.083
Hello?

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:06.333
Father Lucas, I need you
to come here, immediately!

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.792
<i>I'm going to...</i>

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:13.125
You did not understand.
I said, immediately!

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:28.417
<i>Father Thomas!</i>

01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:30.542
<i>Father Thomas!</i>

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:36.833
Is that all right, Father Thomas?

01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:38.792
I came as fast as I could.

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:42.042
You were euphoric on the phone,
I got worried. Did something happen?

01:12:42.167 --> 01:12:44.000
Nothing that I cannot solve.

01:12:44.292 --> 01:12:47.458
I need you to practice
an exorcism session.

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:48.542
Sure, of course.

01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:53.250
Wait here a minute, I'm going to get
my stole and I'll be right back.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.333
Father Thomas, your stole is here.

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.417
Thank you!

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:46.667
I see that my friend is
already coming back.

01:15:47.083 --> 01:15:48.083
Father Thomas...

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:49.500
What's happening, Father Thomas?

01:15:50.792 --> 01:15:51.917
What is going on?

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:55.333
Why am I tied up?

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:57.000
What's happening, Father Thomas?

01:15:57.083 --> 01:15:58.292
Shut up!

01:15:58.583 --> 01:16:00.167
Father Thomas, it's me Lucas.

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:01.792
Lucas, your friend.

01:16:02.333 --> 01:16:05.208
It is you! Father Lucas, my friend!

01:16:05.875 --> 01:16:09.667
Father Thomas,
if anything is dominating you,

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.333
some evil force, resist!

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:15.059
You're stronger than that.
You're stronger than that!

01:16:15.083 --> 01:16:16.500
- <i>I'm stronger.</i>
- You are!

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:17.792
<i>- I am!</i>
- Let me go.

01:16:17.917 --> 01:16:19.417
Set me free, I can help you.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:22.083
Let me go. I can help you.

01:16:22.167 --> 01:16:24.500
- If you let me go...
- Shut up!

01:16:24.583 --> 01:16:26.000
You don't fool me.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:28.309
But for God's sake, Father Thomas...

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:31.000
Wash that mouth before talking
about the Lord, my God!

01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:33.208
You filthy thing!

01:16:33.292 --> 01:16:35.018
But father Thomas,
I don't understand what is...

01:16:35.042 --> 01:16:36.125
What does that mean?

01:16:36.208 --> 01:16:37.625
Don't you understand?

01:16:37.792 --> 01:16:39.333
You will understand now.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.833
Take a look at this photo.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:58.417
Come on, show us who you are.
You filthy worm.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.208
Reveal yourself!

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:06.167
Your cross is your light.

01:17:06.875 --> 01:17:09.083
Try to resist, Father Lucas.

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:11.708
Father Lucas is no longer here!

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:13.375
So resist, Father Lucas.

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:15.750
Did not I say I was coming back, priest?

01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:31.292
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.833
Thy kingdom come, Your will be done

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:35.792
on Earth as it is in heaven.

01:17:35.917 --> 01:17:37.667
Give us this day our daily bread.

01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:40.125
You surrendered the soul
of your own friend.

01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:42.875
You're going to die with your guilt.

01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:45.268
Just as we forgive those
who have offended us...

01:17:45.292 --> 01:17:48.083
Father Thomas...

01:17:48.417 --> 01:17:51.000
Father Thomas.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.083
Now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:55.417
Holy Mary! Full of grace,
the Lord is with you.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.958
Blessed are you, among women.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:59.333
Your brother is in hell!

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:00.458
Is not true.

01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.917
Is not true!

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:08.167
In the middle of a legion of devils,
eating, sucking...

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.250
Devouring every bit of his skin...

01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:17.083
Every little bit, you filthy priest,
I'll defecate on top of your body.

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.542
I'm going to eat every bit of your soul!

01:18:19.625 --> 01:18:21.875
You lost, you lost, you lost!

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.917
Father Lucas, resist.

01:18:46.042 --> 01:18:47.208
Father Lucas,

01:18:48.042 --> 01:18:51.667
the cross of Jesus is your salvation,
stop it.

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:55.708
Father Thomas, it is me, Father Lucas.

01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:57.750
- It is not you!
- Listen to me!

01:18:58.125 --> 01:19:01.583
You can lower the cross,
it's me, your friend.

01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:04.792
The Lord saved me, the Lord saved me.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:06.458
- The Lord is my God!
- Thank you!

01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:07.750
Thank you.

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:11.333
You got it, you kicked it out.

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:13.083
You did it.

01:19:13.208 --> 01:19:14.875
Our Father, who art in heaven.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.750
Hallowed be your name.

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:18.083
Thy kingdom come...

01:19:25.292 --> 01:19:27.792
You fucking priest.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.417
Traitor!

01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:37.458
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:41.625
Father Lucas, you have
fallen into your own trap.

01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:43.500
Come back, Lucas, come back.

01:19:53.125 --> 01:19:55.083
RESTRICTED AREA

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:57.042
Where am I, my God?

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.958
- My son!
- Father!

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:02.000
How you grew up!

01:20:03.458 --> 01:20:05.125
No, no, don't come close.

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:08.625
I know it sounds strange,
but it's me, your father.

01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:14.292
Where are we? Is this paradise?

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:16.833
No, son, not really!

01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:19.125
I committed suicide as you remember.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.458
I cannot enter paradise.

01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:22.750
So, is it purgatory?

01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:26.500
No, they call this place
the Champs Elysées,

01:20:26.583 --> 01:20:28.958
but the name matters little.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:33.167
If I'm here, on the Champs
Elysées with you, then!

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.833
That means I died, dad.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:37.583
No, son. You are not dead yet.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:39.208
But look.

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:43.292
Father Thomas, he will perform the
ritual of the cross for the second time,

01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:44.958
but it will not succeed.

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.333
Because Lucifer...

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:50.250
Lucifer will seize his soul and body,

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:52.667
then, you two are going to die.

01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:54.583
No, I cannot, I cannot get through...

01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:56.583
Son, please!

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.292
Come with me.

01:20:58.417 --> 01:21:01.583
Come to know all this, come on!

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:09.458
I'm sure you'll like it here.

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:11.250
That is good, father,

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:14.333
I'm glad to hear this because
I had a completely different idea,

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:17.708
I thought that whoever committed suicide
would go straight to hell.

01:21:17.917 --> 01:21:19.083
It's not that, it's...

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.292
No, no!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:23.708
Son, don't worry about it,
because in the end,

01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:25.750
good always wins.

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:32.417
Son, the demons will invade Earth, but,
look, people will no longer know

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.500
who the devil is and who they are.

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:38.250
But, Father, how can God
allow such a thing?

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.375
I don't understand, I...

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:43.417
In the end, good always wins.

01:21:44.167 --> 01:21:47.542
Now, look at all this. See?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.250
<i>It's beautiful, father!</i>

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:52.250
It's beautiful, it's wonderful.

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:53.375
Son.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:00.167
I miss you so much, I had
so much to talk to you.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:02.667
I did not even have time
to talk, I love you.

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:05.750
So much... in my teens
I want to share with you.

01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:08.458
Son, don't worry.

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:12.375
We'll be together and here you
can be whatever you want.

01:22:12.708 --> 01:22:13.958
Never give up,

01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:16.208
the important thing is
not where the soul goes

01:22:16.458 --> 01:22:19.250
but how it returns, is not it?

01:22:19.333 --> 01:22:21.833
Who told you that, son? Huh?

01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:27.833
What's it?

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:31.250
- You did.
- Did I?

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.833
It's true, son, I told you that,

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:38.750
but, it was in other times,
I did not have the experience...

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:39.958
You are not my father.

01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.542
I... I'm your father!

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.125
I will come back.

01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:45.625
Lucas!

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.500
I am your father!

01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:49.750
Let me go!

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.292
- I know who you are.
- No!

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:54.750
- I know your name.
- No!

01:22:55.125 --> 01:22:59.458
I'll go back and I'll shout your
name so that everyone can hear.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:01.917
<i>Me and Father Thomas are
going to expel you.</i>

01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:20.542
We must be quick.

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:22.625
Do the ritual of the cross, fast!

01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:24.750
I don't know how long I can hold it.

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.750
Quick, fast, he's very strong!

01:23:48.083 --> 01:23:49.458
<i>Blood of Christ,</i>

01:23:49.542 --> 01:23:53.250
intoxicated, of the evil spirit,
defend me.

01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:58.083
Reveal, Lord, this fallen spirit,

01:23:58.167 --> 01:24:02.375
by the breath of Your mouth,
reveal, Lord.

01:24:08.583 --> 01:24:13.875
In the name of the Virgin Mary,
of the Archangel Michael, I bind you!

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:26.167
EXORCISM RITUAL

01:24:29.208 --> 01:24:34.250
I hide you, Satan! Enemy
of the salvation of mankind.

01:24:34.375 --> 01:24:37.458
He acknowledges the justice
and goodness of God the Father.

01:24:37.542 --> 01:24:41.333
Who hath condemned thy pride
and envy with righteous judgment.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:46.083
Come out of that creature of God,
which He marked with divine stealth.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.250
It recognizes the power
and strength of Jesus Christ.

01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:51.500
Recognize!

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:56.125
It recognizes that God is its creator.
Recognize now.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:25:00.417
I want you to recognize,
you filthy demon.

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:03.208
Recognize that God created you!

01:25:23.917 --> 01:25:26.083
Is that all you have, father?

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:29.042
<i>Is that your power?</i>

01:25:31.458 --> 01:25:36.208
Your brother is much stronger
than you. You are weak!

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:39.500
<i>You have no strength,
your God has forsaken you.</i>

01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:42.833
You have always lived in
the shadows of your brother,

01:25:42.917 --> 01:25:44.375
at the expense of your brother.

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:49.875
You were never the true exorcist priest.
You, you're crap.

01:25:49.958 --> 01:25:51.417
A trash!

01:25:58.458 --> 01:26:00.458
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:26:00.583 --> 01:26:05.375
and of all the saints and angels,
I command you, say your name!

01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:07.042
I will not...

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:09.667
Let's go! Say it!

01:26:10.208 --> 01:26:12.792
Say your name!

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:24.750
Lucifer!

01:26:57.250 --> 01:26:58.333
Father Thomas!

01:27:15.875 --> 01:27:18.000
<i>Father Thomas?</i>

01:27:20.375 --> 01:27:21.750
Father Thomas?

01:27:22.458 --> 01:27:26.250
And this was practically
my third exorcism.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.542
<i>Okay, Father. Cut!</i>

01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.083
<i>- Cut, Renan.</i>
- Yes, I stoped.

01:27:30.167 --> 01:27:32.875
This house here belonged
to Father Thomas Biaggio himself,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.625
he left his inheritance for
me and Sister Maria Lúcia.

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.434
<i>Renan, check to see if
everything is recorded there!</i>

01:27:37.458 --> 01:27:39.875
<i>- Father Lucas!
- Do as I say, man!</i>

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.333
She is already sedated
and is already asleep.

01:27:42.417 --> 01:27:44.208
- It's all right, Father.
- Great, great!

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.417
Here are your keys.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.792
Leave at the same place, sister, please?

01:27:47.917 --> 01:27:49.208
Yes, Father.

01:27:54.208 --> 01:27:56.375
Good! So?

01:27:56.542 --> 01:27:57.583
Let's continue?

01:27:57.708 --> 01:28:00.083
So, priest, we don't want
to disturb you anymore, do we?

01:28:00.167 --> 01:28:01.500
We have to leave, it's late.

01:28:01.583 --> 01:28:03.958
So let's set it aside for another day.

01:28:04.042 --> 01:28:07.792
Yes, we can. I'll see the
best day and I'll call you.

01:28:07.917 --> 01:28:09.375
- Okay.
- Go on, man!

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:11.500
Come through here,
I'll open the gate for you.

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:12.625
Okay, alright.

01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:14.333
- Nice!
- Excuse me.

01:28:21.792 --> 01:28:22.792
Let's go?

01:28:22.833 --> 01:28:23.875
Excuse me!

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:30.000
I'll accompany you to there!

01:28:30.083 --> 01:28:31.809
You don't need a priest,
you already know the way.

01:28:31.833 --> 01:28:33.250
- Okay?
- Thank you.

01:28:33.333 --> 01:28:34.708
- Go, go!
- I'm on my way!

01:28:34.792 --> 01:28:36.167
If you like it that way.

01:28:38.042 --> 01:28:41.000
But, look, go through this gate
here that I have control.

01:28:41.083 --> 01:28:42.625
Okay, father, thank you.

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.000
- Goodbye!
- Thank you!

01:29:10.250 --> 01:29:13.292
- Wait a second!
- What are you doing?

01:29:16.083 --> 01:29:18.583
- Look, look.
- Are you crazy?

01:29:18.833 --> 01:29:20.708
- Are you crazy?
- Come here, come, come.

01:29:20.792 --> 01:29:21.809
Come what, man? Are you crazy?

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:22.875
Come here!

01:29:26.375 --> 01:29:28.000
- You're crazy, man!
- Come, come.

01:29:28.083 --> 01:29:30.000
- Come here!
- We come in here, man.

01:29:30.083 --> 01:29:31.875
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:34.059
If the priest gets us here, you can
forget the interview tomorrow!

01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:35.893
I want you to screw this
interview with this priest.

01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:38.625
What we need to get famous
is inside that room.

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:39.750
What do you mean, guy?

01:29:39.792 --> 01:29:40.976
Did not you hear the sister's
conversation with the priest?

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I heard yeah, so what?

01:29:42.042 --> 01:29:43.842
So, they're keeping
a possessed girl in there.

01:29:43.958 --> 01:29:45.583
- Okay, then what?
- Are you dumb?

01:29:45.833 --> 01:29:48.033
Don't you realize that if we
film this girl, we're done?

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:50.667
Think! Real footage of a possessed girl.

01:29:50.917 --> 01:29:53.143
Man, we will have more than
one million views on <i>YouTube</i>.

01:29:53.167 --> 01:29:55.083
It's okay, smartass, now I want to know,

01:29:55.167 --> 01:29:57.417
- how do we get in there?
- Ah! Friend...

01:29:57.875 --> 01:29:59.000
With this!

01:29:59.750 --> 01:30:02.042
Handsome dude, come on! This way!

01:30:04.375 --> 01:30:06.625
- I'm not going in there, man.
- You faggot, man.

01:30:10.292 --> 01:30:12.250
- The priest's going to get us.
- Come, come!

01:30:12.667 --> 01:30:15.750
- Man! Come, come! Come on.
- Okay!

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:21.208
- Come on, come on.
- I can't.

01:30:21.292 --> 01:30:23.333
- I'm afraid to mess with these things.
- Be a man.

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:25.208
Faggot, me?
What if the girl wakes up there?

01:30:25.292 --> 01:30:27.333
She's sedated, dammit! Come, come.

01:30:27.417 --> 01:30:28.708
Bruno, this is won't end well...

01:30:28.792 --> 01:30:30.792
Okay, so stay here! I'll go alone.

01:30:30.917 --> 01:30:34.125
But stay here at least to see
if anyone shows up, okay?

01:30:34.833 --> 01:30:38.500
Give the camera over there,
give me the camera. Come on, chicken.

01:30:41.167 --> 01:30:42.625
Damn it!

01:30:42.958 --> 01:30:44.167
Keep an eye on it!

01:31:19.667 --> 01:31:21.208
<i>Look at this room.</i>

01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:25.500
<i>Here many people have been exorcised.</i>

01:31:25.917 --> 01:31:29.750
<i>Many were possessed by evil spirits.</i>

01:31:33.167 --> 01:31:34.417
<i>Damn it!</i>

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.417
<i>This will payoff a lot of money.</i>

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:45.000
Bruno...

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:46.500
Bruno!

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.375
I think I heard a noise, man.

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:50.750
Bruno!

01:31:54.292 --> 01:31:55.333
My God!

01:31:58.333 --> 01:31:59.458
Oh, my God, man!

01:31:59.792 --> 01:32:00.809
What scream was that there?

01:32:00.833 --> 01:32:02.351
Nothing, it was nothing,
let's get out of here, come on.

01:32:02.375 --> 01:32:04.583
- Did you record the girl?
- Yes, I did.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Let's go!

01:32:37.958 --> 01:32:39.333
Why is the door open?

01:32:53.042 --> 01:32:54.292
Oh my God!

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:08.833
Father Lucas?

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:10.875
Father Lucas...

01:33:11.875 --> 01:33:14.167
Father Lucas, what happened?

01:33:16.292 --> 01:33:21.458
Father Lucas, well done.
You have saved another soul.

01:33:24.958 --> 01:33:26.333
What is it, Father Lucas?

01:33:27.292 --> 01:33:28.875
Did something happen?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.167
Not yet,

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:33.250
but it will happen!

01:33:39.917 --> 01:33:41.083
Come in!

01:33:43.375 --> 01:33:46.292
Bruno, I still can't believe it, dude!
We did it.

01:33:46.417 --> 01:33:48.917
We invaded the priest's house.
Boy, you're crazy, man!

01:33:50.417 --> 01:33:52.059
I'm very curious to know
what you recorded here.

01:33:52.083 --> 01:33:53.750
- And we'll watch?
- Let's go!

01:33:53.833 --> 01:33:55.875
Well, I'm going to the bathroom first

01:33:56.292 --> 01:33:58.083
to wash my face, I'm not very well.

01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:00.958
<i>But you can go in the bedroom!
Go there.</i>

01:34:01.042 --> 01:34:02.917
- Yeah, but be fast.
<i>- That's okay!</i>

01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:19.542
Bruno!

01:35:23.917 --> 01:35:24.917
Bruno.

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.875
Bruno, are you okay, dude?
