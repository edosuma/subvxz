00:16.602 --> 00:20.356
-I can feel a presence.
-That'll be Duncan,
he's outside the door.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.944
And he's supposed to be fixing
the generator, not earwigging
on his Auntie Liz.

00:25.028 --> 00:26.404
DUNCAN: All right, Lex.

00:26.487 --> 00:30.324
It was very sweet of him
to arrange this for me.

00:30.408 --> 00:32.744
You really shouldn't have
put yourself to
all this trouble.

00:32.827 --> 00:34.871
No trouble.

00:34.954 --> 00:39.542
A wedding anniversary
is a wedding anniversary,
in this world and the next.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.628
Hector was never very good
at things like anniversaries.

00:42.712 --> 00:44.839
Try calling him.

00:44.922 --> 00:47.842
He wasn't much good
at listening either.

00:47.925 --> 00:50.094
We've made contact.

00:50.178 --> 00:51.179
S.

00:52.972 --> 00:54.223
O.

00:55.433 --> 00:56.559
A.

00:57.852 --> 00:59.937
P.

01:00.021 --> 01:01.856
Does that mean
something to you?

(LEXIE GIGGLING)

01:03.982 --> 01:06.277
Sorry, that was me.
Shopping list.

01:08.071 --> 01:10.406
Oh, thanks, Duncan.

01:10.490 --> 01:13.326
Hector MacDonald,
are you there?

01:15.661 --> 01:17.705
Probably gone
fishing or something.

01:17.789 --> 01:24.253
No, no, there's someone trying
to get through. He has
a message, an urgent message.

01:24.337 --> 01:25.713
A warning.

01:35.932 --> 01:37.100
What is it?

01:39.936 --> 01:41.396
I don't know.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.312
Archie?

02:25.106 --> 02:26.441
(BANGING)

02:27.942 --> 02:29.068
Archie?

02:32.071 --> 02:34.449
Hi.

02:34.531 --> 02:38.953
-Was that just you there?
-Er, no, this is me.
Why, what's wrong?

02:39.037 --> 02:42.457
I just got this feeling
that some... Oh, nothing.

02:42.540 --> 02:43.915
Why are you not at the office?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.752
Well, I thought I'd
take a couple of days off.

02:45.835 --> 02:50.590
-Mmm, what's brought this on?
-Well,
the death duties are paid,

02:50.673 --> 02:53.551
the wolf park's doing okay,
we all seem to be
talking to one another.

02:53.634 --> 02:55.428
There's not a cloud
on the horizon.

02:55.511 --> 02:58.181
So, what are we
gonna do, then?

02:58.264 --> 02:59.640
Come and see.

03:03.436 --> 03:06.564
Er, Jamie's room?

03:06.647 --> 03:08.816
Yeah, we did
the right thing clearing it.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.027
But we can't leave it like
this, it's neither one thing
nor the other.

03:11.110 --> 03:13.237
I want to redecorate.

03:13.321 --> 03:17.033
-Archie, we can't
afford decorators just now.
-No, I'll do it myself.

03:17.116 --> 03:19.327
(GIGGLING) You?

03:19.410 --> 03:23.748
-Any objections?
-You don't know your
Artex from your elbow.

03:23.831 --> 03:26.417
-Thank you.
-And what about the estate?

03:26.501 --> 03:29.170
And the village art show?
They don't run by themselves.

03:29.253 --> 03:33.424
Well, I had hoped that my
beautiful and talented
wife might do that.

03:33.508 --> 03:36.260
-This'll only take
a couple of days.
-Yeah, and the rest.

03:36.344 --> 03:38.971
And you can't have
Duncan and Golly to help you.
I'll need them.

03:39.055 --> 03:40.973
No, I'll do it on my own.

03:41.057 --> 03:45.728
There is no way that you're
gonna be able to decorate this
without any help.

03:45.812 --> 03:49.273
-I'd put money on it.
-All right, you're on.

03:49.357 --> 03:54.237
Let's say dinner for two
at a restaurant of
the winner's choice.

03:54.320 --> 03:57.323
-I'll start looking
at The Good Food Guide.
-Okay.

04:01.452 --> 04:05.164
-You don't have to run away.
-I'm... I'm not.

04:05.247 --> 04:07.000
Yes, you are,
and you have been

04:07.083 --> 04:09.252
for the last week.
If you'd just give me
a chance to explain.

04:09.335 --> 04:11.379
What is there to explain?

04:11.462 --> 04:14.090
My so-called girlfriend's
pregnant and won't tell me
who the father is.

04:14.173 --> 04:17.218
-Seems pretty clear to me.
-Duncan,
I understand how you feel.

04:17.301 --> 04:20.430
Oh, do you?
That's good, because I don't.

04:20.512 --> 04:23.891
In fact, right now,
I have absolutely
no idea how I feel.

04:23.975 --> 04:26.936
All I know is that I
don't even want to be
in the same room as you.

04:27.018 --> 04:28.354
I'm sorry.

04:31.274 --> 04:32.984
Are you all right?

04:33.067 --> 04:36.029
-I'm gonna be sick, so
unless you want to watch...
-Morning.

04:38.990 --> 04:41.367
I'm sorry if I've
interrupted something.

04:41.451 --> 04:45.329
No, you're all right,
Golly, we're finished.

04:50.877 --> 04:53.588
-What are you doing?
-Tidying up.

04:53.671 --> 04:55.380
But your painting things?

04:55.465 --> 04:57.633
You know, I haven't managed to
finish a single thing

04:57.717 --> 04:59.635
since I did that portrait
of your father.

04:59.719 --> 05:04.849
So, I'm hanging up my brushes
and turning in my turpentine.

05:04.932 --> 05:07.018
But you can't
give up painting,
you've always loved it.

05:07.101 --> 05:10.313
I'm not giving up painting,
painting's giving up me.

05:10.396 --> 05:14.317
I sometimes
think I only did it
to get away from your father.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.235
No need to do that now.

05:16.319 --> 05:18.529
What about
the art competition?
You've entered that for years.

05:18.613 --> 05:21.699
Oh, there'll be plenty
of entries without mine.

05:21.783 --> 05:23.368
Did you want something?

05:23.451 --> 05:27.080
Um, oh, yeah, I wondered
if you might go
and see Andrew Booth.

05:27.163 --> 05:28.790
You know, welcome him
to Glenbogle.

05:28.873 --> 05:33.127
I'd go myself,
but I'm gonna be
busy redecorating.

05:33.211 --> 05:36.964
Redecorating? Are you
sure that's a good idea?

05:43.513 --> 05:46.349
-Oh, hi, Lexie.
-Have you got a minute?

05:46.432 --> 05:48.518
Uh-huh, come in.

05:48.601 --> 05:51.604
-That was some show.
-Sorry?

05:51.686 --> 05:57.318
You know, that thing outside
the window, it was quite
scary. How did you do that?

05:57.402 --> 06:01.239
-How did I do what?
-Ha! You know,
that flash of light.

06:01.322 --> 06:03.825
I'm sure that I saw someone
or something out there.

06:03.908 --> 06:08.246
Oh, so there was a ghost?
Oh, Lexie.

06:08.329 --> 06:11.207
There are no
ghosts at Glenbogle.

06:11.290 --> 06:13.793
Have you never heard
of Robert MacDonald?

06:13.876 --> 06:16.629
Yeah, but that was
a story just made up
for the tourists.

06:16.713 --> 06:23.136
The ghost of the first laird
always appears at times of
trouble for the family.

06:23.219 --> 06:26.222
So where has he been
for the past few years?

06:26.305 --> 06:29.058
Do you not know the story?

06:29.142 --> 06:35.148
Robert MacDonald married a
serving girl, Mhari,
who worked for the family.

06:35.231 --> 06:39.193
A year and a day
later he disappeared.

06:39.277 --> 06:42.739
All his young bride
found was a charred corpse.

06:42.822 --> 06:44.282
You're making this up.

06:44.365 --> 06:47.577
No, I've a book somewhere
that tells you all about it.

06:47.660 --> 06:50.204
I'll lend it to
you if you like.

06:50.288 --> 06:53.833
Och, Lexie,
would you do me a favour?

06:53.916 --> 06:58.713
I'm secretary for
the Highland Spiritualist
and Clairvoyant Circle.

06:58.796 --> 07:00.340
It's just, I'm up for
re-election

07:00.423 --> 07:04.719
But if I could
just show the girls
Robert MacDonald.

07:04.802 --> 07:08.389
Okay, okay, why not?
Bring them round for
dinner tomorrow night.

07:08.473 --> 07:11.017
Oh, thanks.

07:15.563 --> 07:17.065
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:19.567 --> 07:21.652
Sorry.

07:21.736 --> 07:24.405
Is anyone
actually serving here?

07:24.489 --> 07:29.285
Gordon runs
the post office as well,
so you never can tell.

07:29.369 --> 07:31.079
We haven't met,
I'm Archie MacDonald.

07:31.162 --> 07:35.124
Oh, Andrew Booth,
pleased to meet you.

07:36.793 --> 07:40.672
You must be the one
who's moved
into Golly's croft.

07:40.755 --> 07:43.424
You've probably no idea
how much of a favour
you've done us all.

07:43.508 --> 07:45.927
-Really?
-Mmm.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.845
I hope you'll be throwing
yourself into village life.

07:47.929 --> 07:50.765
Come to the art show,
my family organises it.

07:50.848 --> 07:53.935
-Might even enter it.
-Oh, really?
Are you an artist?

07:54.018 --> 07:58.147
-No, enthusiastic amateur.
-Well, you must enter it.

07:58.231 --> 08:01.150
There's no shortage of space.
I'll get you the details.

08:01.234 --> 08:04.779
-Thanks.
-And if there's anything
else we can do, just ask.

08:04.862 --> 08:08.616
Oh, there is one thing.
I'm looking for someone
to do some cleaning for me.

08:08.700 --> 08:12.829
Duncan, he works on
the estate, his aunt sometimes
does some cleaning.

08:12.912 --> 08:15.123
-I'll get her to
come and see you.
-Thanks.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.835
Morning, Gordon.

08:18.918 --> 08:20.837
(CAR HONKING)

08:26.342 --> 08:28.678
Oh,
he runs the garage as well.

08:37.562 --> 08:41.399
If you're looking
for the walking trail,
you're in the wrong direction.

08:41.482 --> 08:44.944
Oh, you're joking, aren't you?
Back that way, is it?

08:45.028 --> 08:49.699
-It is.
-I'm only trying to get
a shot of a waterfall.

08:49.782 --> 08:52.160
I work for a postcard company.

08:52.243 --> 08:55.996
And I'm putting together
this new Highlands
collection for them.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.791
If you're interested
in giving us a hand,
there's a drink in it for you.

08:58.874 --> 09:01.002
I've already got a job,
thank you.

09:01.084 --> 09:04.547
-You don't work at
Glenbogle House, do you?
-What's it to you?

09:04.630 --> 09:06.341
Just that I want to
get some pictures there.

09:06.424 --> 09:09.385
Ah, well, you need to speak to
the estate office for that.

09:09.469 --> 09:12.013
Oh, right, that'll be
Irene Stuart, isn't it?

09:12.096 --> 09:14.515
No, it isn't.
It's Archie MacDonald.

09:14.599 --> 09:18.478
You sure? I spoke to
a guy in the village
and he gave us Irene's name.

09:20.980 --> 09:24.108
Oh, well, my mistake, eh?

09:24.192 --> 09:27.820
-I found a fellow lurking
down by the loch today.
-Mmm-hmm.

09:29.238 --> 09:30.823
Said he was a photographer.

09:30.907 --> 09:34.285
That someone had
given him your name
as a contact here.

09:34.369 --> 09:37.789
-Why would they do that?
-You tell me.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.707
What did he look like?

09:39.791 --> 09:44.504
About 40, dark greying hair.
Quite good-looking I suppose,
Glasgow accent.

09:44.587 --> 09:47.006
-You sure?
-Somebody you know?

09:47.090 --> 09:50.093
No, no,
it was probably a mistake.

09:50.176 --> 09:53.304
Yeah, yeah,
that's what he said.

09:53.388 --> 09:55.640
So there's no
reason why somebody
should be looking for you?

09:55.723 --> 09:59.227
-No, of course not.
-So what's wrong?

09:59.310 --> 10:04.357
-I just haven't been
feeling too well, that's all.
-Ah.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.860
Sorry to hear that.

10:07.944 --> 10:11.406
-Well, I hope you'll
be feeling better soon.
-Thanks.

10:19.580 --> 10:20.915
You're not allowed
to interrupt.

10:20.998 --> 10:25.044
I've just come in to see
how you were getting on.

10:25.128 --> 10:28.798
-Lex, you're in the way.
-Did you choose the wallpaper?

10:28.881 --> 10:31.384
-It's over there.
-Let's see.

10:37.265 --> 10:40.560
-What's this?
-Sheep.

10:40.643 --> 10:43.354
And who'll be sleeping
in here? Little Bo Peep?

10:43.438 --> 10:46.482
This has always
been a child's bedroom.
It's tradition.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.943
Hmm, you must know
something I don't.

10:49.027 --> 10:53.740
No, but if this is going to
be the nursery, we'll need to
redecorate sooner or later.

10:53.823 --> 10:58.036
-And I don't get
any say in this?
-What, you don't like sheep?

10:58.119 --> 11:01.581
I don't have a problem
with sheep. It's you getting
all broody on me.

11:01.664 --> 11:03.833
-I am not.
-Ach, right.

11:03.916 --> 11:07.670
So why else would you spend
the only time that you've had
off in months building a nest?

11:10.381 --> 11:12.967
Fine, don't tell me, then.

11:13.051 --> 11:16.054
I want this to stop
being Jamie's old room.

11:18.681 --> 11:22.185
I suppose this is
one way of doing it.

11:22.268 --> 11:25.188
And besides,
we're bound to have children
sooner or later.

11:25.271 --> 11:29.942
Well, later would do me.
I'm not in any rush.

11:30.026 --> 11:34.614
I guess I always thought that
once we were married,
then maybe we'd be ready.

11:34.697 --> 11:39.535
You might be,
just don't go
ordering any cot just yet.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.922

12:20.243 --> 12:21.661
Hi. Come in.

12:24.163 --> 12:27.542
I'm Molly MacDonald,
I'm your neighbour.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.419
You must be Mrs Booth.

12:29.502 --> 12:33.131
(LAUGHING) Oh, no!
Andrew's in the bedroom.

12:33.214 --> 12:38.928
-Er,
maybe this isn't a good time.
-No, no, it's okay. Andrew!

12:39.012 --> 12:41.639
He's washing,
he got ever so dirty.

12:41.723 --> 12:45.393
Oh, I'll...
I'll come back later.

12:45.476 --> 12:47.812
Andrew, how do you want me?

12:52.358 --> 12:56.195
-Are you all right with that?
-Just got to move it so
I can paper behind it.

12:56.279 --> 12:58.364
-Do you want me
to give you a hand?
-No, no.

12:58.448 --> 13:00.575
I told Lexie I'd do all
the decorating by myself.

13:00.658 --> 13:04.912
That's not decorating,
son, that's plumbing.

13:04.996 --> 13:08.458
-Are you sure you
don't want me to help?
-No, thank you.

13:08.541 --> 13:11.961
I'm gonna prove to Lexie
that I'm not
completely useless

13:12.045 --> 13:14.297
when it comes to
doing something practical.

13:14.380 --> 13:15.590
(PIPE BURSTING)

13:22.472 --> 13:26.309
Right, I think you'd better go
and turn the water off, then.

13:27.477 --> 13:28.561
Yes.

13:33.149 --> 13:35.568
-How's it going?
-Great.

13:35.651 --> 13:40.239
-Are you managing
all right by yourself?
-Yeah, no problem.

13:40.323 --> 13:41.908
Yeah, little accident.

13:41.991 --> 13:43.868
(LEXIE CHUCKLING)

13:43.951 --> 13:48.373
Oh, I do have one request.
Could you paint
"Wayne" on the door?

13:48.456 --> 13:50.333
Why?

13:50.416 --> 13:54.462
Well, you get to choose
the wallpaper so I get to
choose our baby's name.

13:54.545 --> 13:56.214
-Wayne?
-Hmm.

13:56.297 --> 13:58.883
And if it's a girl,
then we can cross
out the W and put J.

13:58.966 --> 14:02.387
You know, it'll be dead
classy. It'll be like
Jayne with a "Y".

14:02.470 --> 14:05.556
Oh, listen, and while you're
at it, could you decorate
a few more rooms?

14:05.640 --> 14:09.310
I mean, why stop at one kid?
I'm thinking more seven,
eight, or...

14:09.394 --> 14:11.312
(CLATTERING)

14:11.396 --> 14:15.024
What was that?
I thought I heard something.

14:15.108 --> 14:17.235
Maybe it's
the ghost of Glenbogle.

14:17.318 --> 14:19.153
-Forget it.
-I wish I could.

14:19.237 --> 14:21.155
Duncan's aunt gets
out her Ouija board

14:21.239 --> 14:23.491
and all of a sudden
we're in the middle
of The Blair Witch Project.

14:23.574 --> 14:26.661
-Okay,
okay, there's no one there.
-Thank you.

14:29.288 --> 14:33.251
I met Andrew Booth earlier.
I thought we should
invite him over to dinner.

14:33.334 --> 14:35.837
I'll be busy, of course,
but you could look after him.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.630
Are you going to invite
his little friend?

14:37.714 --> 14:39.799
Well, Golly thought he
seemed to be on his own.

14:39.882 --> 14:42.051
Not if you count
nubile brunettes.

14:42.135 --> 14:47.265
Oh, Archie, she could sit
beside you. You could talk
about sheepy wallpaper.

14:47.348 --> 14:52.311
-You mean you
haven't actually met him?
-No. He was otherwise engaged.

14:52.395 --> 14:54.439
Well, you know, if it wasn't
for him and Golly,

14:54.522 --> 14:56.566
then we could
have lost everything.

14:56.649 --> 15:00.486
Fine, if you really
think it's that important,
I'll go and see him tomorrow.

15:00.570 --> 15:03.906
Unless you'd
rather I went tonight?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.159
Before you start, there's
something I'd like to say

15:06.242 --> 15:08.619
and I'd prefer to tell
you all together.

15:08.703 --> 15:13.624
Some of you do know
this already but...
I'm having a baby.

15:13.708 --> 15:18.880
Um, I've thought things
through and I think it's best
all round if I leave here.

15:20.631 --> 15:25.136
I'd like to do that
as soon as possible.
Enjoy your meal.

15:29.599 --> 15:32.935
Well, this is crazy, if you
and Irene are having a baby,
we should be celebrating.

15:33.019 --> 15:37.190
-It's not Duncan's.
-Oh. Right.

15:38.858 --> 15:41.361
Thanks for that.
What was that all about?

15:41.444 --> 15:43.404
They're my employers,
they've got a right to know.

15:43.488 --> 15:46.199
How can you let them
know when you don't know
what you're doing yourself?

15:46.282 --> 15:49.994
I do, I've made a decision.
I know what I'm doing.

15:50.078 --> 15:51.954
-But you can't leave.
-I can!

15:52.038 --> 15:54.874
The baby's father,
he's coming to look for me
and I'm not ready to see him.

15:54.957 --> 15:56.959
But that's just running away.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.962
If you're not interested
in this guy any more,
why don't you just tell him?

16:00.046 --> 16:03.091
-It's not as easy as that.
-Ah, so maybe you
are still interested.

16:03.174 --> 16:06.678
I'm sorry, I should have told
you first, but we can't go on
like this, can we?

16:06.761 --> 16:07.804
No.

16:11.724 --> 16:13.434
So that's it?

16:20.650 --> 16:22.360
Good night, Irene.

16:35.373 --> 16:39.377
-So, what are you celebrating?
-Life being so great.

16:39.460 --> 16:43.131
Ooh, I know what you mean.
I haven't worked in
six months, still...

16:43.214 --> 16:46.551
-What is it you do?
-I'm the red danger.

16:46.634 --> 16:50.388
-Eh?
-I'm the head ranger.

16:50.471 --> 16:54.767
-Oh, yeah, and where
do you do that, then?
-At Glenbogle.

16:54.851 --> 16:56.769
Irene Stuart works there,
doesn't she?

16:56.853 --> 16:59.188
How's she doing?
I haven't seen her in ages.

16:59.272 --> 17:02.567
-You know Irene?
-Oh, yes, we go way back.

17:04.777 --> 17:09.449
-So, why are you here now?
-Kind of personal, you know.

17:09.531 --> 17:11.742
Look,
I'll get you another drink.

17:13.536 --> 17:16.289
Hang on!

17:16.372 --> 17:20.960
You turn up and
Irene says she's leaving.
Oh, I get the picture, pal.

17:36.017 --> 17:41.356
-How did I get here?
-How do you think? I
scraped you up off the floor.

17:41.439 --> 17:45.067
-I'm not hungry.
-Put it on the bruise.

17:45.151 --> 17:46.401
Oh, right.

17:47.904 --> 17:49.364
(GROANING)

17:51.323 --> 17:53.785
-How are you feeling?
-Stupid.

17:53.868 --> 17:57.997
Well, it wasn't
exactly your finest hour.
Anything we can do to help?

17:58.081 --> 18:00.749
I don't want help.

18:00.833 --> 18:04.628
-I want some people
to show some respect.
-We do that.

18:04.712 --> 18:06.547
-Irene?
-She does, too.

18:06.631 --> 18:09.759
She's just trying to not
make things worse for you.

18:09.841 --> 18:11.636
She's going away
with that bloke.

18:11.719 --> 18:15.515
No, no, no,
she's going to her parents.
That's what she told us.

18:15.598 --> 18:19.769
-I don't want
her to go anywhere.
-I know, Dunc.

18:19.852 --> 18:21.688
Why's she going?

18:21.771 --> 18:25.650
Maybe she doesn't
want to bring up a baby
on her own.

18:25.733 --> 18:29.487
It's gonna be hard
enough for the kid
not having a father.

18:40.123 --> 18:42.166
(DOORKNOB CLICKING)

18:44.002 --> 18:45.128
Archie?

18:47.755 --> 18:48.965
(CRASHING)

18:49.048 --> 18:50.550
Archie?

19:38.723 --> 19:40.433
What are you doing?

19:42.435 --> 19:45.188
The stag's head
fell off the wall.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.982
Well, you probably
banged the bedroom door
once too often.

19:48.066 --> 19:50.568
-Why are you not in bed?
-I had to
finish the undercoat.

19:50.651 --> 19:54.572
-It's the middle of the night.
-I was getting
behind schedule.

19:54.655 --> 19:58.159
Look.
Where did they come from?

19:58.242 --> 20:00.370
I probably walked
through some plaster
or something.

20:00.453 --> 20:03.498
But they stop dead here.

20:03.581 --> 20:05.375
You don't think that's odd?

20:05.458 --> 20:07.794
No, I think it's
a couple of minutes' work
with the hoover.

20:07.877 --> 20:12.715
Archie, something's going on.
Something weird.

20:12.799 --> 20:15.009
Yes.
It's the middle of the night,
we're standing in the hall

20:15.093 --> 20:18.513
talking about stags'
heads and dust on the carpet.

20:18.596 --> 20:20.223
Let's go to bed.

20:29.148 --> 20:32.652
You know all
this hearing things?

20:32.735 --> 20:36.155
Maybe you're imagining
it because you're upset.

20:36.239 --> 20:38.741
(SIGHING) Why
would I be upset?

20:38.825 --> 20:42.662
Because of what we were
talking about earlier.
I mean, children.

20:44.455 --> 20:47.291
I'm sorry, but I just
thought it was something
that we both wanted.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.835
Yeah, it is.

20:52.130 --> 20:54.173
From as early as
I can remember,

20:54.257 --> 20:56.676
I grew up with my mother
telling me about
all the things

20:56.759 --> 20:59.637
I stopped her from doing.

20:59.721 --> 21:02.932
I know she loved me
in her own way, but...

21:03.016 --> 21:04.350
(SIGHING)

21:04.434 --> 21:07.979
I knew she
resented me being there
almost just as much.

21:10.106 --> 21:13.067
(SIGHING) I want to
choose when I'm ready.

21:15.319 --> 21:16.446
Okay.

21:28.082 --> 21:29.459
(YAWNING)

21:31.502 --> 21:33.463
I brought you some tea.

21:37.008 --> 21:39.719
So, what was the fight about?

21:41.929 --> 21:43.014
You.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.726
It was your ex.

21:46.809 --> 21:49.729
Well, what did he say?

21:49.812 --> 21:51.481
I can't remember.

21:54.025 --> 21:55.610
Do you know something?

21:55.693 --> 21:58.780
You're the first man ever
to get into a fight over me.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.992
I would anytime.

22:03.076 --> 22:06.120
-What,
so you can get beaten up?
-No.

22:06.204 --> 22:08.206
So we could be together.

22:11.209 --> 22:15.213
-I love you, Irene.
-Duncan,
you know I have to go.

22:15.296 --> 22:19.217
You don't.
You don't have to
keep on running away.

22:19.300 --> 22:24.389
You could stay and
have the baby here.
And I could be the dad.

22:24.472 --> 22:28.184
We're great together,
it'd work.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.311
I don't know what to say.

22:32.563 --> 22:38.361
Well, you don't have to say
yes just now, but you could
just think about it.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.698
I will. I promise.

22:50.206 --> 22:54.335
-By the way, I'm Molly.
-Yes,
Archie told me all about you.

22:54.419 --> 22:58.006
-Pleased to meet you, come in.
-Oh, you've got
quite a lot to sort out.

22:58.089 --> 22:59.549
Well, it'll be easier now
you're here.

22:59.632 --> 23:02.093
Could you unpack those,
put them on that shelf?

23:02.176 --> 23:04.762
Oh, is this your daughter?

23:04.846 --> 23:07.890
-No, that's my wife.
-She'll be joining you here?

23:07.974 --> 23:10.852
I shouldn't think so,
she died five years ago.

23:10.935 --> 23:14.772
Oh, er,
these must be your children.

23:14.856 --> 23:16.482
Yes, some of them.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.985
-How many have you got?
-Four or five.

23:19.068 --> 23:21.070
Look, perhaps it's
best if I did this.

23:21.154 --> 23:23.322
Perhaps you could make
a start on the bathroom.

23:23.406 --> 23:26.159
I'm afraid it's in
a terrible state.

23:26.242 --> 23:28.036
You want me to clean
the bathroom?

23:28.119 --> 23:29.829
No, I want you to
do the whole house.

23:29.912 --> 23:33.583
Perhaps we should
talk about terms.
I could offer you Â£4 an hour.

23:33.666 --> 23:35.752
Look, I've got to dash now,
I'll pay you when I come back.

23:35.835 --> 23:37.837
And then we'll talk
about references, okay?

23:37.920 --> 23:39.964
Good, thank you.
I'll see you later.

23:47.263 --> 23:49.974
-From Golly.
-Thank you.

23:50.058 --> 23:52.560
-Do you want a hand in here?
-No, no, no need.

23:54.437 --> 23:56.439
Have you got time?

23:56.522 --> 24:02.820
Well, Lexie wants me to set up
the art show but she's
not here so I don't have to.

24:02.904 --> 24:06.616
How do you fancy a spot
of redecorating? Lexie,
she doesn't need to know.

24:06.699 --> 24:09.327
-Okay.
-Great.

24:09.410 --> 24:11.579
-So, how are you feeling?
-Great.

24:11.662 --> 24:13.206
You know what you
said last night

24:13.289 --> 24:15.458
about Irene
not wanting to bring up
the baby on her own?

24:15.541 --> 24:18.961
Well, you were right.
I talked to her so
I'm gonna be the father.

24:19.045 --> 24:22.048
-Oh, great. So she's staying?
-Yeah, I've been
thinking about it all morning.

24:22.131 --> 24:24.258
I think I'd be
a fantastic dad.

24:24.342 --> 24:29.222
I mean, good at all the
important things. You know,
pulling faces, comics and...

24:29.305 --> 24:31.391
So Irene is
definitely staying?

24:31.474 --> 24:33.685
That's not what
she said last night.

24:33.768 --> 24:38.815
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely...
thinking about it.

24:38.898 --> 24:44.028
I mean, why would she not
want to stay? It's a great
place to bring up a kid.

24:44.112 --> 24:48.783
Yeah, it's pretty good, yeah.
How many people have
you told about this?

24:48.866 --> 24:50.952
You, Auntie Liz.

24:51.035 --> 24:53.413
Well, if I were you,
I wouldn't tell too
many more until

24:53.496 --> 24:55.498
it's a little bit
more definite.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.792
Oh, it's definite.

24:57.875 --> 25:00.461
It's gonna happen.

25:00.545 --> 25:03.423
I'm gonna make it happen.

25:03.506 --> 25:05.550
LEXIE: So the stag's
head falls off the wall

25:05.633 --> 25:08.553
and then there's
these ghostly footprints
that lead to nowhere.

25:08.636 --> 25:12.056
That's not
usually a good sign.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.183
What am I gonna do?

25:14.267 --> 25:17.979
I can't even speak to Archie
about it because he just
thinks I'm mad already.

25:18.062 --> 25:22.275
If it's Robert MacDonald,
he'll be telling you
someone's in danger.

25:22.358 --> 25:23.818
But who?

25:23.901 --> 25:28.031
Why not ask the tarot cards?
They'll tell us for sure.

25:28.114 --> 25:29.949
I don't believe
in all that stuff.

25:30.033 --> 25:33.745
Ah,
but the day before yesterday
you didn't believe in ghosts.

25:43.129 --> 25:45.381
So, do you think
you'll get this finished
by tomorrow?

25:45.465 --> 25:47.675
Should do if there
aren't any more problems.

25:47.759 --> 25:49.302
Ah!

25:49.385 --> 25:53.014
-Are you all right?
-No,
these wires are still live.

25:53.097 --> 25:55.683
Well, they shouldn't be.
I'll go and check.

25:58.186 --> 26:01.981
Well, be careful.
We've had enough
shocks for one week.

26:05.026 --> 26:08.654
LIZ: The Fool.
LEXIE:
Well, that must be me, then.

26:08.738 --> 26:11.783
No, that's not
a person in that position,
it's a prediction.

26:11.866 --> 26:15.870
It means expect
the unexpected.

26:15.953 --> 26:20.291
The Wheel of Fortune.
That means there's gonna
be a change in your life.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.252
A big change,
everything turned upside down.

26:23.336 --> 26:28.216
And, um, could this change
maybe involve having a baby?

26:28.299 --> 26:32.553
-Not you, too?
-No, no, not at all.

26:32.637 --> 26:36.432
What about the other cards?

26:36.516 --> 26:40.311
The Emperor.
Now that means a ruler
or a figure of authority.

26:40.395 --> 26:43.564
Like a laird?
So, that must be Archie.

26:43.648 --> 26:49.445
Well, maybe, but you have to
remember the cards never have
just the one meaning.

26:49.529 --> 26:52.532
But something's going
to happen to Archie.
What is it?

27:08.589 --> 27:11.134
Dunc,
can you turn the power off?

27:15.388 --> 27:17.640
-Have you seen Archie?
-No.

27:17.724 --> 27:19.726
-Is he upstairs working?
-Yeah.

27:19.809 --> 27:23.271
Yeah, on his own,
without any help
from anyone else.

27:23.354 --> 27:26.441
-LEXIE: Where's Archie?
-He's doing
something in the attic.

27:26.524 --> 27:29.610
Oh, right. Oh, not again.

27:29.694 --> 27:32.238
-I'll go and
check the fuse box.
-Thanks.

27:35.116 --> 27:36.325
Archie?

27:49.714 --> 27:51.716
Archie?

27:51.799 --> 27:53.634
-Don't.
-What?

27:53.718 --> 27:55.470
It's too dangerous.

27:57.347 --> 27:59.724
It's a simple
piece of rewiring, Lex.

28:01.517 --> 28:03.186
DUNCAN: The power's off, Arch!

28:04.562 --> 28:05.855
No!

28:14.655 --> 28:19.035
-He said the power was off.
-Well, it doesn't
look like it, does it?

28:19.118 --> 28:22.747
Auntie Liz read
my tarot cards,
you were gonna die.

28:22.830 --> 28:24.749
Oh, well done, Liz.

28:24.832 --> 28:26.751
What is the point in
trying to finish a nursery
for your children

28:26.834 --> 28:28.294
if you're gonna kill
yourself doing it?

28:28.378 --> 28:30.880
All right,
all right, I'll be careful.

28:33.466 --> 28:35.718
Anyway, I thought we
weren't having children.

28:38.012 --> 28:39.889
Yep, there he is.

28:44.477 --> 28:48.022
-Do you want a look?
-I suppose I'd
better get it over with.

28:57.532 --> 28:59.617
It's not him.

28:59.701 --> 29:03.121
-And does that help?
-I don't know.

29:05.248 --> 29:09.711
You know, Duncan's asked me to
stay here with him.
He says he'll be the father.

29:09.794 --> 29:12.380
What about you?

29:12.463 --> 29:15.550
I just want what's
best for the baby.

29:15.633 --> 29:17.301
You don't sound too sure.

29:17.385 --> 29:20.430
(SIGHING) Well,
I'd love to do that.

29:20.513 --> 29:24.434
But it just doesn't
seem right somehow.

29:24.517 --> 29:27.854
Oh, I don't know
what's right any more.

29:27.937 --> 29:30.398
Well, you know that...

29:30.481 --> 29:33.901
You know that none of
us want to see you go.

29:36.154 --> 29:38.156
Thanks.

29:38.239 --> 29:42.869
If we finish the windows and
the ceiling today, then all we
have to do tomorrow

29:42.952 --> 29:47.123
is the rest of the wallpaper
and the second coat of gloss.

29:47.206 --> 29:49.959
And the radiator and
the cleaning up.

29:50.043 --> 29:52.337
Yeah, but that won't
take any time.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.506
This bet is as good as won.

30:03.014 --> 30:05.058
(CHATTERING)

30:05.141 --> 30:07.935
-Here, ladies,
would you like some wine?
-Thank you.

30:08.019 --> 30:09.729
There we go. Thanks.

30:11.606 --> 30:14.150
-Some wine?
-No, no, thank you.

30:19.781 --> 30:21.449
Did they leave all their
broomsticks by the door?

30:21.532 --> 30:23.368
Archie, shh,
they'll hear you.

30:23.451 --> 30:27.205
-Oh, they might
turn me into a toad.
-You're halfway there already.

30:27.288 --> 30:29.624
I shall be upstairs
finishing the gloss.

30:29.707 --> 30:34.337
Archie, is there any sherry?
One of the ladies
is asking for it.

30:34.420 --> 30:36.172
I'll go and get it.

30:36.255 --> 30:41.678
Duncan.
Duncan, this is Mrs Munroe,
she's a water diviner.

30:41.761 --> 30:46.766
Could you possibly show her
where the loo is? She's having
trouble finding it.

30:46.849 --> 30:50.978
-Oh, good evening.
-Oh,
hello, you work here as well?

30:51.062 --> 30:52.980
-All the time.
-Great, thanks.

30:53.064 --> 30:55.191
-Oh!
-Oh! Sorry.

30:55.274 --> 30:58.236
It's all right. Clumsy.

30:58.319 --> 31:01.114
Hi, Andrew,
I'm Lexie, Archie's wife.

31:01.197 --> 31:03.991
-Oh, hello, how are you?
-Hi, I see you've
met Molly already.

31:04.075 --> 31:07.370
Ah, yes, yes, yes,
I hope she'll be doing
some cleaning for me.

31:07.453 --> 31:09.497
Molly's useless at cleaning.

31:09.580 --> 31:13.334
Well, I did wonder,
but Archie recommended her.
Said Duncan's aunt needed...

31:13.418 --> 31:19.090
Oh,
no, Molly is Archie's mother.

31:22.218 --> 31:26.889
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
I've made rather
a fool of myself.

31:26.973 --> 31:30.977
Never mind, I'm sure
it's not the first time.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.604
So, I assume you
won't be taking the job?

31:33.688 --> 31:37.442
No, though from what I've
seen, you're not short of
willing scrubbers.

31:40.069 --> 31:44.073
-I'm so glad you two have met.
-Only wish I
could say the same.

31:47.076 --> 31:48.286
Sherry?

31:49.704 --> 31:52.707
-How's it going?
-Another five minutes.

31:52.790 --> 31:55.877
Um, this probably
isn't the best time to ask,

31:55.960 --> 31:59.339
but Duncan seems to think
that you'll be staying here.

31:59.422 --> 32:00.882
I haven't made up my mind yet.

32:00.965 --> 32:05.011
Okay, okay, just let
us know when you decide.

32:05.094 --> 32:09.432
-Maybe I should stay.
-Well, if you do,
there'll be no going back.

32:11.934 --> 32:15.396
If you change your mind,
then you'll break his heart.

32:20.151 --> 32:24.113
Caused a lot of trouble,
hasn't it,
for something so small?

32:24.197 --> 32:25.907
Oh, yes.

32:27.367 --> 32:29.243
But it'll be worth it.

32:31.079 --> 32:34.082
Oh, I nearly forgot.
Somebody left this
for you on the doorstep.

32:34.165 --> 32:35.541
Oh, thanks.

32:46.427 --> 32:49.681
Oh! What were you watching?

32:49.764 --> 32:52.058
The world's
worst wedding video.

32:55.311 --> 32:57.730
This is my wedding.

32:57.814 --> 32:59.649
That's Ian.

32:59.732 --> 33:01.234
What happened?

33:01.317 --> 33:05.238
I couldn't go through with it.
I ran away and ended up here.

33:06.698 --> 33:08.700
-Is he the father?
-Yeah.

33:08.783 --> 33:11.786
And he's found
out that I'm here.

33:11.869 --> 33:14.372
This arrived today.

33:14.455 --> 33:17.458
-Does he know about the baby?
-No. No.

33:21.004 --> 33:23.047
Well, he doesn't have to.

33:25.466 --> 33:27.844
Maybe you're right.

33:27.927 --> 33:31.097
I humiliated him in
front of his family
and all his friends.

33:31.180 --> 33:33.307
I'm really not very
good news, you know.

33:33.391 --> 33:35.852
I seem to mess
up people's lives.

33:38.771 --> 33:40.064
Not mine.

33:44.777 --> 33:46.529
I hope you left some for me.

33:46.612 --> 33:50.116
Well, they've finished
what's on their plates
and all the leftovers.

33:50.199 --> 33:52.910
You mean my
dinner's in the coven?

33:52.994 --> 33:54.829
They're certainly
a bunch of happy mediums.

33:54.912 --> 33:57.623
So, how's your entry
for the art competition
coming along?

33:57.707 --> 34:00.376
Slowly, but I hope
it'll be ready in time.

34:00.460 --> 34:04.130
-Oh, do you paint?
-Sculpture's more my thing.

34:04.213 --> 34:09.510
-How about you?
-A little. In between
cleaning assignments.

34:09.594 --> 34:12.972
She's brilliant.
She's won the competition
for the past five years.

34:13.056 --> 34:14.974
Let me guess, watercolours.

34:15.058 --> 34:17.518
Oh, and what is
the matter with watercolours?

34:17.601 --> 34:22.023
Nothing. As long as
they're not those insipid,
wishy-washy landscapes.

34:22.106 --> 34:23.983
My speciality.

34:24.067 --> 34:28.196
That's better than those sad
people who paint
portraits of their pets.

34:33.451 --> 34:37.663
-Do you often have
spiritualists to dinner?
-Oh, no, this is a one-off.

34:37.746 --> 34:39.456
Lexie thinks
we've got a ghost.

34:39.540 --> 34:43.335
So she's invited Liz
and the Weird Sisters
to frighten it away.

34:43.418 --> 34:45.170
There is a ghost.

34:45.254 --> 34:47.422
Yeah, and we keep
it with the fairies
from the bottom of the garden

34:47.507 --> 34:49.759
and the leprechaun we found
at the end of the rainbow.

34:49.842 --> 34:53.804
-Don't even listen to him.
-We don't have a ghost.

34:53.888 --> 34:57.892
I think we all have ghosts.
Things that keep
us awake at night.

34:57.975 --> 35:01.729
Those private troubles
that we don't talk
to anyone else about.

35:01.813 --> 35:04.607
Yeah,
but they don't walk around
with sheets over their heads,

35:04.691 --> 35:08.695
getting conjured up by ladies
of a certain age with too much
time on their hands.

35:08.778 --> 35:12.824
In my experience,
you can never be too sure
what form they'll take.

35:18.413 --> 35:22.834
Well, it's been
a most memorable evening.

35:22.917 --> 35:26.462
-I hope we meet again soon.
-That may be
difficult to avoid.

35:26.546 --> 35:28.589
-Good night.
-Good night.

35:36.263 --> 35:40.143
Oh, Archie, Archie,
I want to enter
that art competition.

35:40.226 --> 35:42.060
You said you'd
given up painting.

35:42.145 --> 35:44.688
-I have,
but I've taken it up again.
-Why?

35:44.772 --> 35:48.735
That is one of the most
boring, annoying men I have
ever met in my life.

35:48.817 --> 35:52.613
Come on, we can't stand by
and watch him win that prize.
Quick.

36:10.756 --> 36:12.967
(CREAKING)

36:26.397 --> 36:30.610
You know, I sometimes think
you're the only
one I could paint.

36:30.693 --> 36:34.655
Oh,
do stop licking your thingys,
much too Francis Bacon for me.

36:39.660 --> 36:41.454
It was there again last night.

36:42.121 --> 36:44.665
Great, Great.

36:46.084 --> 36:51.255
No, it's not great.
It's terrible.

36:51.339 --> 36:56.219
Look, I want you to get rid
of this thing that's moving
around the house all night.

36:58.262 --> 37:01.099
There's only one option left.

37:01.182 --> 37:06.229
We'll have to
repeat the seance
exactly as it was before.

37:06.312 --> 37:09.941
That will allow
the spirit to return to rest.

37:18.366 --> 37:23.037
-Have you room for one more?
-Sure, Molly.
Where would you like it?

37:23.121 --> 37:24.539
-Over there.
-Okay.

37:24.622 --> 37:26.749
But be careful,
it's still wet.

37:26.833 --> 37:31.796
-So,
where's Andrew's sculpture?
-Er, oh, it's over here.

37:31.879 --> 37:34.882
It's quite good really.
He was telling me
how he works from life

37:34.966 --> 37:38.553
and he's had this
model coming round
to his house every day.

37:38.636 --> 37:40.763
Right. Hmm.

37:42.306 --> 37:44.809
LEXIE: So, what do you think?

37:44.892 --> 37:47.395
Shame there are
no pigeons around.

37:50.982 --> 37:55.111
Hi, I've brought some
stuff from Auntie Liz.
Toys, games, whatever.

37:55.194 --> 37:57.238
I've made a list of
things that we need to do.

37:57.321 --> 37:59.490
Have you
registered with Dr Brown
in the village yet?

37:59.574 --> 38:01.075
-Yes.
-Great.

38:01.159 --> 38:02.869
Something else
we need to decide.

38:02.952 --> 38:05.913
Are we gonna stay here
or are we gonna
move into the village?

38:05.997 --> 38:09.375
Because if we're gonna move
in there, my Auntie Liz has
got a room we can have.

38:09.459 --> 38:12.837
And, oh, and have you
seen the school yet?
We need to talk about that.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.174
-I think we can probably
leave it for a few days.
-Yeah.

38:16.257 --> 38:18.134
Now, there's something else.

38:18.217 --> 38:21.554
Ah, yeah,
are we gonna get married?
You know, for the baby?

38:21.637 --> 38:23.181
That's not a good reason for
getting married.

38:23.264 --> 38:26.309
No, you're right,
but we could anyway.

38:26.392 --> 38:29.479
I'm not very good at weddings.

38:29.562 --> 38:31.856
Of course.

38:31.939 --> 38:35.651
-No wedding just yet.
-Duncan,
hold on, we need to talk.

38:35.735 --> 38:41.491
Not now, though.
I promised to tell Archie.
And Lexie, and...

38:41.574 --> 38:44.452
I don't know whether
I'm coming or going.

38:46.037 --> 38:47.288
(SIGHING)

38:48.206 --> 38:49.791
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

38:56.756 --> 39:01.010
"Useless"?
Being a bit hard on yourself,
aren't you?

39:01.094 --> 39:05.098
Useless is
the name of the dog.
What's your piece called?

39:05.181 --> 39:06.724
Bust of a Young Girl.

39:06.808 --> 39:08.893
And what a lot
of bust she has.

39:08.976 --> 39:11.020
Lexie told you that the winner
has to make a speech?

39:11.104 --> 39:13.106
Yes, she did mention it.

39:13.189 --> 39:15.942
So, that's why you're making
notes? You're that certain
you're going to win.

39:16.025 --> 39:17.985
I make no great
claims about my work,

39:18.069 --> 39:21.322
but I am absolutely certain
I'll be making a speech.

39:21.406 --> 39:25.034
I'm not sure what's worse,
your false modesty
or your smugness.

39:25.118 --> 39:26.994
LEXIE: Andrew, are you ready?

39:32.959 --> 39:35.920
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your
attention please?

39:36.004 --> 39:41.968
(CLEARING THROAT) Thank you
very much for coming to
the Glenbogle Art Competition.

39:42.051 --> 39:46.889
Unfortunately, Mrs MacKay,
who was going to
be our judge today,

39:46.973 --> 39:52.645
had a bit of
an accident with her easel.
So, at the very last minute,

39:52.729 --> 39:59.235
Andrew Booth very kindly
withdrew his entry from the
competition to take her place.

39:59.318 --> 40:00.486
Andrew.

40:04.282 --> 40:08.244
Thank you.
I'd like to congratulate
all the exhibitors here today.

40:08.327 --> 40:12.373
I'm enormously impressed
by the very high
standard of all the works.

40:12.457 --> 40:15.335
However,
we have to have a winner.

40:15.418 --> 40:18.379
Now there is one picture
that stands out for me.

40:18.463 --> 40:22.759
It's a beautiful composition.
It's got a real life to it.

40:22.842 --> 40:25.136
It's "Useless" by
Molly MacDonald.

40:29.223 --> 40:32.643
And I hope you'll accept
my exhibit as the prize.

40:32.727 --> 40:35.563
Oh, thank you so much.

40:35.646 --> 40:36.939
Congratulations.

40:41.527 --> 40:43.404
No.

40:43.488 --> 40:46.741
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's tea and refreshments
at the back of the hall.

40:48.993 --> 40:53.247
Well, you've changed my
mind about pet portraits.

40:53.331 --> 40:58.002
Good, because, in a way,
it was because of you
that I started painting again.

40:58.086 --> 41:00.129
You stopped when
your husband died.

41:00.213 --> 41:02.757
-How did you know that?
-A guess.

41:02.840 --> 41:05.468
And I saw that
portrait you did of him.

41:05.551 --> 41:10.223
The odd thing is, since then,
every time I try to paint,
I see his face.

41:10.306 --> 41:14.852
Still, I suppose I cheated
with Useless, there is quite
a strong resemblance.

41:17.063 --> 41:20.108
So, I inspired you
to pick up your
brushes again, hmm?

41:20.191 --> 41:23.653
No, with you it
was more irritation
than inspiration.

41:26.072 --> 41:28.116
Don't forget your prize.

41:28.199 --> 41:30.493
Why don't you finish it first?

41:34.205 --> 41:37.709
-What?
-(CHUCKLING) I
didn't say anything.

41:51.597 --> 41:55.685
LEXIE: Thanks, Molly. I know
this doesn't make any sense
but I had to give it a try.

41:55.768 --> 41:59.230
(WHISPERING) Well, anything,
if you think it'll help.

42:03.276 --> 42:06.029
LIZ: Robert MacDonald,
can you hear me?

42:20.460 --> 42:23.254
Lexie, speak to him.

42:27.884 --> 42:31.721
I know you've been
trying to reach me.

42:31.804 --> 42:33.431
What do you want?

43:03.670 --> 43:05.254
(CLATTERING)

43:32.407 --> 43:33.825
(CRASHING)

43:33.908 --> 43:35.034
Oi!

43:55.888 --> 43:58.766
-What's going on?
-I've found your ghost.

44:00.476 --> 44:02.270
So it's you that's been
creeping round the house?

44:02.353 --> 44:04.355
I'll explain
everything to Irene Stuart.

44:04.439 --> 44:07.316
You can tell us or
you can tell the police.

44:10.528 --> 44:13.865
Okay, look,
I'm a private detective.
I was hired to find Irene.

44:15.575 --> 44:17.827
It was supposed to be
a straight forward job.

44:17.910 --> 44:21.039
Find Irene,
take a couple of pictures.

44:21.122 --> 44:23.583
DUNCAN: He tried to
work me over in the pub
and all.

44:23.666 --> 44:25.418
Yeah,
well, didn't get much, did I?

44:25.501 --> 44:28.171
Just had to listen
to you droning on
and on and on.

44:28.254 --> 44:32.216
So I didn't feel too bad
when I borrowed your keys.

44:32.300 --> 44:36.220
Now I've installed covert
video surveillance in some
pretty heavy locations,

44:36.304 --> 44:39.390
but they were a piece of cake
compared to this gaff.

44:39.474 --> 44:42.352
It's a death trap.

44:42.435 --> 44:44.771
It was a test of nerve.

44:44.854 --> 44:47.565
But still,
nothing I couldn't handle.

44:47.648 --> 44:50.109
...dust on the carpet.
Let's go to bed.

44:51.694 --> 44:53.529
ARCHIE: So, what was
your plan for this evening?

44:53.613 --> 44:56.032
You were going to bug
the suits of armour,
hang some listening

44:56.115 --> 44:57.909
devices from the chandeliers?

44:57.992 --> 45:01.704
No, my client wanted me
to deliver a letter to Irene.

45:01.788 --> 45:03.414
What, with all this
surveillance

45:03.498 --> 45:05.792
you didn't notice
that we do actually
have a letterbox?

45:05.875 --> 45:08.586
-I'm calling the police.
-No. This is all my fault.

45:08.670 --> 45:11.422
I don't want
anyone else involved.

45:11.506 --> 45:16.219
My coming here, hiding,
it's caused
enough trouble already.

45:16.302 --> 45:20.014
-We can't just let
him get away with it.
-Please, Archie.

45:23.184 --> 45:27.772
-Make sure he doesn't
get lost on the way out.
-No worries, boss. Come on.

45:31.859 --> 45:35.363
-This is for you.
-From Ian, obviously.

45:36.698 --> 45:39.158
-Irene?
-Just let her read it first.

45:45.540 --> 45:46.958
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

45:47.041 --> 45:51.879
-DUNCAN: Irene? Are you there?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

45:51.963 --> 45:54.424
Are you okay?
What are you doing?

45:54.507 --> 45:58.720
Nothing. Can you
just give me a minute?

45:58.803 --> 45:59.929
Okay.

46:01.806 --> 46:03.307
I'm here if you want me.

46:04.934 --> 46:06.811
I know, Duncan.

46:15.111 --> 46:17.030
(GIGGLING)

46:18.072 --> 46:20.116
Oh!

46:20.199 --> 46:22.035
Okay. Open your eyes.

46:23.453 --> 46:26.080
Oh, Archie.

46:26.164 --> 46:28.166
What happened
to all the sheep?

46:28.249 --> 46:30.001
Well, it's like you
were saying last night.

46:30.084 --> 46:33.296
We spend far too
much time thinking
about the past and the future,

46:33.379 --> 46:36.132
and what we should be doing
is enjoying what we've got.

46:36.215 --> 46:39.594
So I've made this room
a kind of blank canvas.

46:39.677 --> 46:42.138
We decide together what
we want to do with it.

46:42.221 --> 46:44.390
And what about
carrying on the family line?

46:44.474 --> 46:47.602
-It doesn't really matter.
-Of course it does.

46:47.685 --> 46:50.521
What would I know?
I don't have a family tree,

46:50.605 --> 46:53.941
I don't even have
a family pot plant.

46:54.025 --> 46:57.111
You need to tell
me what you want.
I can't read your mind, Arch.

46:57.195 --> 47:00.656
I want you.
And I want you to be happy.

47:00.740 --> 47:03.326
Oh, and by the way,
I won the bet.

47:03.409 --> 47:06.412
Ha! That is not finished.

47:06.496 --> 47:09.791
-It was finished.
-Thanks to Golly and Duncan.

47:09.874 --> 47:13.920
Okay, so I cheated and it's
a mess but it's still
a kind of moral victory.

47:14.003 --> 47:17.924
Okay, then I can take you out
for a kind of moral dinner.

47:18.007 --> 47:21.135
I wouldn't mind staying in.

47:21.219 --> 47:25.640
-You know what we could do?
-What?

47:25.723 --> 47:29.227
We could start
thinking about something
to put in here.

47:29.310 --> 47:32.230
-What did you have in mind?
-Curtains.

47:33.773 --> 47:35.066
Curtains?

47:57.046 --> 48:01.843
-Is that you away, then?
-Yeah.

48:01.926 --> 48:06.180
Can you tell Archie and
Lexie for me? I'll call them,
but I really hate goodbyes.

48:06.264 --> 48:08.141
Yeah, I gathered that.

48:10.018 --> 48:11.728
What about Duncan?

48:14.147 --> 48:16.941
I'm sorry,
I just can't face him again.

48:19.027 --> 48:22.447
I wish things hadn't
worked out like this.

48:22.530 --> 48:23.906
Me, too.

48:26.617 --> 48:30.038
-Will you tell
him after I've gone?
-Sure.

48:31.205 --> 48:32.540
Thanks.

48:59.776 --> 49:02.528
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

49:02.612 --> 49:07.909
Yes, we can go and talk to Ian
and then we can
come back home.

49:07.992 --> 49:10.620
-This isn't my home.
-You're running away again.

49:10.703 --> 49:14.707
-No, for me staying
here is running away.
-Why?

49:16.751 --> 49:18.419
Why are you doing this?

49:18.503 --> 49:21.464
Because every time I
look at my baby's face
I'm going to see Ian.

49:21.547 --> 49:24.592
I can't run away
from that any more.

49:24.676 --> 49:27.595
That's why it can't
work for you and me.

49:27.679 --> 49:33.851
-Irene, I love you.
-Duncan,
this isn't about us any more.

49:33.935 --> 49:36.104
This is about my child.

49:36.187 --> 49:38.648
And I know you want to
take on the responsibility

49:38.731 --> 49:41.317
of being the father,
but you're not, Ian is.

49:41.401 --> 49:44.570
And he's the one with
the important job, and he's
the one with the big money.

49:44.654 --> 49:46.489
Don't. Don't do this.

49:51.160 --> 49:56.290
-You're so kind.
-I'm fed up with being kind,

49:56.374 --> 50:01.045
because kind means
being the nice guy
who smiles and waves goodbye

50:01.129 --> 50:03.840
and I'm not doing that,
not any more.

50:03.923 --> 50:08.094
I'd have given anything
to spend my life with you.

50:10.888 --> 50:14.600
And however you look at it,
you just don't feel the same.

50:15.893 --> 50:17.603
And you never did.

50:19.355 --> 50:21.315
This isn't what I want.

50:23.651 --> 50:26.863
Oh, Duncan,
please, can't we be friends?

50:28.948 --> 50:31.284
No. I've got friends.

51:10.490 --> 51:13.910
Come on, son, come on.
I'll drive.

51:31.761 --> 51:35.556
-You come here to talk
to Father, don't you?
-Silly, isn't it?

51:37.266 --> 51:41.521
I always feel
a little closer to him
when I'm out here.

51:41.604 --> 51:43.564
But he's gone.

51:43.648 --> 51:45.274
And we miss him.

51:46.192 --> 51:47.443
Yes.

51:50.488 --> 51:57.203
Knowing Father, he's on some
big, celestial golf course,
stuck in a bunker probably.

51:57.286 --> 52:01.666
It would be nice to think so,
but I really don't
believe in that sort of thing.

52:01.749 --> 52:03.084
You go in.

52:10.049 --> 52:11.509
Oh!

52:11.592 --> 52:13.886
Useless, you silly dog.
