<i>How the hell did we get here?</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:07.439
<i>Well,</i>

00:07.441 --> 00:09.608
<i>A beginning, middle, and end.</i>

00:09.610 --> 00:11.510
<i>And the beginning</i>

He's little. He's black.
He's really cute!

Who wouldn't kidnap him?
It was only a matter of time!

Oh! Oh!
Oh, really?!
Give me --
give me the bag, please.

01:52.680 --> 01:56.448
It takes you two hours
to find a little black boy,

01:56.450 --> 01:57.816
And then you're here
in two seconds

01:57.818 --> 01:59.184
When I accidentally steal
a clutch?!

01:59.186 --> 02:01.120
Well, you know what?
I'm keeping it!

02:01.122 --> 02:07.893
That's right.
I'm keeping it!

Rainbow: I thought
our son was gone!

02:12.600 --> 02:15.801
I am not spanking him.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.569
Look, pops used to spank me

02:17.571 --> 02:19.771
With a hot wheels track
for sport.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.874
That's how he got his name --
pops.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.675
You'd just be sitting there,
minding your own business,

02:23.677 --> 02:25.244
And then, out of no place,
pop!

02:25.246 --> 02:26.178
For no good reason.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.479
You're not listening
to me!

02:27.481 --> 02:28.881
Okay,
this is very serious!

02:28.883 --> 02:30.582
This hiding thing
has got to stop,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.384
And jack needs to be
taught a lesson.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.719
Well, if you want
to spank him so bad,

02:33.721 --> 02:34.786
Why don't you
do it yourself?

02:34.788 --> 02:35.888
Because you're the spanker,
dre.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.623
I did it one time.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.891
One more than me.

02:38.893 --> 02:43.462
And you said if you spanked him,
you would go into labor!

02:43.464 --> 02:46.765
That you have no idea
how the human body works.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.700
Bow, I can't do it again.

02:48.702 --> 02:51.904
Spanking junior put me
in the bed for three days!

02:51.906 --> 02:54.473
He shed that one tear like
denzel in "glory,"

02:54.475 --> 02:56.408
And I cried like
whoopi in "color purple."

02:56.410 --> 02:57.576
But that's not the point.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.411
Because we said
that we would punish him,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.647
And we need
to follow through.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.416
No,<i> you</i> promised, now you want
<i>me</i> to follow through.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.518
Okay, I feel like
you're blaming me for this.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.253
I<i> am</i> blaming you for this!

03:08.255 --> 03:09.788
Bow, it's your fault!

03:11.624 --> 03:13.659
I can still remember
junior's face

03:13.661 --> 03:17.930
I just hope the memory
of that whupping has faded.

03:17.932 --> 03:20.632
It was the Thursday
of a leap year.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.734
The air was crisp.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.369
The sky was blue.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.405
And the belt was black!

03:26.407 --> 03:28.373
I don't want
to hear anymore!

03:28.375 --> 03:29.741
Not even about the color
of my tears?

03:29.743 --> 03:30.742
They were red!

03:30.744 --> 03:31.743
Aah!

03:31.745 --> 03:34.346
Okay, don't be mean.
He's scared.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.514
He should be.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.882
It's terrifying.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.951
I mean, not for me.
I'm too old to be spanked.

03:38.953 --> 03:40.319
I've aged out.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.888
Where'd you hear that,
junior?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.591
That means
I'm out of the whupping window.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.893
Yeah, but you still have an ass,
don't you?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.561
That means
you're still in the window.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.764
My research shows
we have legal options --

03:52.766 --> 03:54.933
Emancipation,
extrication,

03:54.935 --> 03:57.636
And, if all else fails,
relocation.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.938
I wish I had you
when I divorced grandma.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.373
Might've held on
to my lincoln.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.675
You're just messing with me,
right?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.877
I mean, nobody's gonna spank
a 9th grader, right?

[ scoffs ]
what's age got to do with it?

04:07.514 --> 04:09.948
When he came home for the summer
from college.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.483
He was all,
"oh, I'm in college, now.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.785
Listen to how smart
my mouth is."

04:13.787 --> 04:14.853
I was like, "pop!"

04:14.855 --> 04:16.555
Okay, come on, pops.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.290
We all know
no one spanks anymore.

<i>For why he shouldn't be</i>

<i>I started to wonder</i>

<i>on spanking.</i>

04:41.515 --> 04:43.949
<i>Was I the only one</i>
<i>dealing with this?</i>

04:43.951 --> 04:45.050
So, it's really a campaign

on what's important --

I have a question.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.395
Were any of you spanked
as kids?

04:56.397 --> 04:58.497
My dad used to have
a rob roy,

04:58.499 --> 05:00.399
Then beat me
with his dress shoe.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.368
My mom used to put rings on
just to spank me.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.804
My mom used to crack me
in the skull with a rolling pin.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.973
Good lord,
that's horrible!

05:07.975 --> 05:10.976
Indian ones are smaller,
but still, it was a rolling pin.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.811
My parents didn't believe
in spanking,

05:12.813 --> 05:13.945
And I turned out awesome.

to kids in china?

and I'm korean.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.723
Oh, totally.
I do. Definitely.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.091
And this country
is losing ground

Because we're
no longer spanking.

I told you to spank him,
not crush his spirit.

18:29.441 --> 18:32.110
Your daddy
is a monster.

18:35.214 --> 18:37.715
Oh, no, it happened.
Whupping's back.

18:37.717 --> 18:39.650
Oh, I'm so screwed.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.252
Uh,
I'm gonna go clean my room.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.753
Yeah, good idea.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.522
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna tell dad

18:44.524 --> 18:46.390
He's handsome
and that I love him.

18:46.392 --> 18:49.827
[ breathes deeply ]
I love you, dad!

18:49.829 --> 18:51.329
Whoa.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.432
Dad actually did it.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.201
I owe pops 50 bucks!

18:58.470 --> 19:02.473
<i>So it turns out I had</i>
<i>another tool in my arsenal</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:03.841
<i>That's a lot more valuable</i>
<i>than a belt --</i>

19:03.843 --> 19:09.447
<i>My kids actually care</i>
<i>what I think about them.</i>

19:09.449 --> 19:10.548
<i>Go figure.</i>

19:10.550 --> 19:11.449
Hey, babe.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.550
Rainbow: Hey.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.519
I'm so proud of you.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.520
Yeah?
Yeah.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.554
Thanks.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.222
Spanking's not for us.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.625
No. No, it is not.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.894
Not unless jack pulls
another stunt like this,

19:22.896 --> 19:25.630
And then I will
light that ass up.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.764
Whew.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.166
Like a christmas tree.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.201
Oh, no, baby.
Like vegas from a plane.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.336
Or...

19:32.338 --> 19:33.938
Something else
that lights up.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.939
[ chuckles ]

19:34.941 --> 19:36.641
Good one, babe.
[ chuckles ]

19:36.643 --> 19:38.442
I couldn't think of anything.
I panicked.
I see.

19:38.444 --> 19:39.844
Oh, no, no, no, I got one!
I got one!
Okay.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.546
[ smacks lips ]

19:41.548 --> 19:43.948
Like a fireworks display.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.216
Hmm.

19:45.218 --> 19:45.850
Mm.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.786
Like a...A milky way.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.721
Babe?
Uh-huh?

19:50.723 --> 19:53.424
No, I said that --
no, we're done.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.930
And the beauty of it is
you're never safe.

19:58.932 --> 20:01.832
So, take this,
for example.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.635
Looks pretty innocent,
but what am I going to do?

20:04.637 --> 20:06.370
Am I gonna
whip up some eggs?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.906
Or am I going to whip
some ass?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.908
Or this.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.878
Am I going to dry
some dishes?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.580
Or am I going to...
[ towel snaps ]

20:15.582 --> 20:18.616
...Dry some tears?
[ chuckles ]

20:18.618 --> 20:19.517
Your turn.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.355
Am I gonna fry some bacon?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.557
Or am I gonna
cave your skull in?!

20:26.559 --> 20:28.859
Yes. Lesson over.

20:28.861 --> 20:32.296
What have I done?
