I'm gonna tell her about this.

21:20.838 --> 21:22.838
(grunts)

21:22.931 --> 21:24.532
Hey.

21:26.027 --> 21:28.577
I think it's the baby.
Something's wrong.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.515
<i> WADE:</i>
<i> Truthfully, I didn't think</i>
<i> you'd hit me back.</i>

21:32.533 --> 21:35.960
That last text was like
a relationship Hail Mary.

21:36.111 --> 21:38.445
Well, I'm glad you did because
I need some business advice.

21:38.464 --> 21:41.281
Okay, well, uh,
let's talk business.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.192
Right, what would you say
if I said, hypothetically,

21:43.194 --> 21:46.804
that I've been offered
a full-blown arena tour?

21:46.955 --> 21:48.288
No.

21:48.308 --> 21:53.385
I wanted to ask you if you would
consider opening for me.

21:53.538 --> 21:55.146
I mean, for anyone else,
not a chance,

21:55.297 --> 21:58.374
but for you... I'm in.

21:58.392 --> 21:59.892
-(door opens)

22:00.044 --> 22:01.560
-I'm all in.
-JAMIE: Hey.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.155
Door was unlocked.
Picked up some barbecue.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.825
Uh, maybe I should leave.

22:08.052 --> 22:10.328
No, it's all right, man.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.813
One step ahead of you.

22:12.907 --> 22:14.582
Jamie.

22:15.651 --> 22:18.002
Jamie, it's just a drink.

22:18.229 --> 22:19.562
-Oh, is that what that was?
-Yes, it was work.

22:19.580 --> 22:21.230
I wanted some advice.

22:21.323 --> 22:22.173
There are a hundred
different people

22:22.400 --> 22:23.415
that you could ask for advice.

22:23.568 --> 22:24.917
People you haven't slept with,
people...

22:25.011 --> 22:26.585
people that aren't
still in love with you.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.238
So please tell me,
what question could you have

22:29.331 --> 22:32.257
that only Smilin' Wade Stellings
could answer?

22:32.352 --> 22:35.168
I asked him if he would
open for me on tour.

22:35.337 --> 22:38.080
-What tour?
-If I vote for the merger,

22:38.099 --> 22:40.733
Skyfair wants me
headlining stadiums.

22:42.253 --> 22:43.586
-When did all this happen?
-Today.

22:43.604 --> 22:45.863
-This all just happened so fast.
-Yeah, but not so fast

22:46.014 --> 22:48.440
that you couldn't loop in Wade
over drinks.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.685
And you asked him
to come with you on the road?

22:51.779 --> 22:54.372
You know what? Maybe you two
can share a tour bus.

22:54.523 --> 22:56.648
Since you're so damn cozy
with each other.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.042
-That's not fair.
-Fair?

22:58.269 --> 23:01.045
I gave up running a label
to stay here and be with you.

23:01.196 --> 23:02.529
I didn't ask you to do that.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.881
Because you didn't have to.

23:04.108 --> 23:07.292
And I'd never stand in the way
of your dreams, not ever.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.461
(chuckles): I mean, how could I,
when I'm the last one

23:09.630 --> 23:11.639
to find out that
they're about to come true?

23:12.708 --> 23:15.059
But I get it. I do.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.353
This is your moment.

23:19.140 --> 23:22.291
And who wants some, some
boyfriend holding them back?

23:22.460 --> 23:24.217
-No, that is not
how things are. I...
-You know,

23:24.311 --> 23:26.295
there are a million different
ways to end relationships,

23:26.388 --> 23:28.388
sometimes dramatic,
and sometimes all you got to do

23:28.408 --> 23:32.493
is invite your ex over and leave
the front door unlocked.

23:34.639 --> 23:36.580
Congratulations, Nicky...

23:38.084 --> 23:40.709

what you've always wanted.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.674
DOCTOR:
Well, your blood pressure
was elevated,

23:55.826 --> 23:57.601
which led to the contractions.

23:57.678 --> 24:00.754
Fortunately, the hydration
seems to have done the trick.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.181

Well, she said
the baby's fine, so...

the both of you.

who started that rumor.

Maybe the merger's
what's best for Monarch.

What are you talking about?

I just want to remind you,

31:25.959 --> 31:27.384
this merger isn't
just about money.

31:27.494 --> 31:30.112
It's about something
far more important.

31:30.130 --> 31:33.298
It's about the future

one thing and one thing only.

Is Monarch gonna flourish

31:47.297 --> 31:49.481
or is Monarch gonna die?

No.

31:59.143 --> 32:01.476
Please, please
think this through.

32:01.495 --> 32:03.995
I did, 'cause I suspected
you were up to something

32:04.164 --> 32:06.006

competitive rates

32:22.757 --> 32:24.332

32:24.351 --> 32:26.318
Nice try, Luke, but still no.

32:28.763 --> 32:30.614

which way she's gonna vote,

32:34.344 --> 32:35.935

you pulled.

32:36.029 --> 32:38.288
Wasn't a stunt.

32:38.515 --> 32:39.748
I wanted to sing
with my little girl.

32:41.685 --> 32:42.960
Please tell me you're not
gonna fall for that.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.245
Shut up and let her
make up her own mind.

32:45.355 --> 32:48.281

to me, Daddy, and it reminded me

that family really is
all that matters.

32:57.384 --> 33:01.369
And we've all been through
so much and, uh...

33:01.388 --> 33:03.388
We get, Nick. It's a slow pass.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.149
Look, just cut to the chase,
okay? I can take it.

33:06.301 --> 33:10.028
But there's something else
that's also true. I...

33:11.473 --> 33:15.492
I put the needs of others
before me my entire life.

33:15.719 --> 33:19.738
My kids, my-my... my ex,

33:19.814 --> 33:21.164
my siblings...

33:22.059 --> 33:23.166
...and my parents.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.168
And I...

33:25.320 --> 33:28.088
think it's time
that I put myself first...

33:31.510 --> 33:33.659
...by saying yes to everything
I've worked for

33:33.679 --> 33:35.570
my entire life.

33:35.589 --> 33:37.764
You're voting yes?

33:39.409 --> 33:40.408
Yeah.

33:40.502 --> 33:43.186
Oh, Nick.

33:43.263 --> 33:45.022
I told Skyler that you had
a head for business

33:45.098 --> 33:47.357
and that you'd know a good thing
when you saw it.

33:49.253 --> 33:51.319
I'll make the call right now.

33:54.441 --> 33:56.424
GIGI:
Well, I'll give you two

33:56.593 --> 33:58.160
a minute.

34:00.430 --> 34:04.099
-Hey, Daddy...
-No. No apologies.

34:04.192 --> 34:07.860
You're a talent, Nicolette,
and the world needs to see it.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.029
Is that what Mama would've done?

34:10.049 --> 34:12.632
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Except for one thing.

34:14.461 --> 34:16.553
Well, she wouldn't look like
she just lost her best friend,

34:16.704 --> 34:18.555
she'd be popping champagne.

34:20.467 --> 34:24.144
That's right, you smile.
You deserve it.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.606
We're good.

34:38.393 --> 34:40.243
Whoa. What are you doing?

34:40.395 --> 34:42.061
I'm just trying
to say good night.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.489
I got to get home.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.232
It's not even 11:00.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.900
No, really, my mom
is, like, really strict.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.253
Come on. You're like
every mother's dream.

34:50.405 --> 34:52.071
-Don't be a creeper.
-ACE: Hey!

34:52.091 --> 34:54.591
Let her go.

34:54.818 --> 34:56.576
Ace, I got it.

34:56.670 --> 34:57.594
See, Ace?

34:58.839 --> 35:00.514
She's got this.

35:02.509 --> 35:04.101
(groans)

35:04.995 --> 35:06.085
What the hell?

35:06.163 --> 35:07.437
You tease!

35:09.015 --> 35:10.774
(engine starts)

35:11.001 --> 35:13.735
(tires screeching)

35:19.009 --> 35:20.675
You all right?

35:20.694 --> 35:23.011
Yeah, except for my hand.

35:23.029 --> 35:25.038
Here.

35:28.368 --> 35:32.170
You know, I was taught
to never break any promises.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.133
Yeah, so I've been told.

35:37.194 --> 35:39.427
First time for everything,
I guess.

35:54.878 --> 35:56.153
(door opens)

36:01.643 --> 36:03.326
Hey.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.147
I guess we got lucky, huh?

36:08.167 --> 36:11.501
That Luke was there
to take you to the hospital.

36:11.578 --> 36:14.654
Oh, yeah.
(chuckles)

36:14.748 --> 36:16.915
Really lucky.

36:17.067 --> 36:20.385
Uh...
I wanted to ask you something.

36:24.183 --> 36:28.410
What were you and Luke
talking about when I got there?

36:28.503 --> 36:32.230
'Cause it didn't seem
like it was about the merger.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.734
No, it wasn't.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.364
There's something
I need to tell you.

36:43.351 --> 36:44.926
When the doctor
was examining me,

36:44.945 --> 36:47.370
she accidentally told me
the sex of the baby.

36:47.597 --> 36:49.614
Really?

36:49.766 --> 36:53.526
We are having a boy.

36:53.603 --> 36:55.045
Oh.

36:55.196 --> 36:57.714
And when I...
I realized what it meant

36:57.883 --> 37:00.217
to our little family,

37:00.368 --> 37:03.869
I got emotional,
and-and that's what you saw.

37:03.964 --> 37:06.781
Wow. A boy.

37:06.800 --> 37:08.207
-Yeah.
-Wow.

37:08.285 --> 37:09.893
-(both laugh)
-Oh, my goodness.

37:10.044 --> 37:12.395
-Amazing.
-I know.

37:17.385 --> 37:19.811
<i> EARL:</i>
<i> There is something very</i>
<i> important we need to discuss.</i>

37:19.905 --> 37:21.071

<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

37:21.314 --> 37:23.465
-Luggage capacity

-(laughs)

37:23.483 --> 37:26.892
Because I'm bringing fall
and summer wardrobes.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.561
I need assurances.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.895
Earl, it's gonna be fun.

37:30.064 --> 37:31.806
You say that every time.

37:31.899 --> 37:33.291
-Every...
-(sirens wailing)

37:36.755 --> 37:38.255
What is that?

37:41.260 --> 37:42.259
Daddy?

37:45.338 --> 37:47.505
All right, Tommy,
you're with me.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.415
(indistinct radio chatter)

37:49.509 --> 37:51.184
Daddy?

38:03.857 --> 38:05.857
What the hell's going on, Tripp?

38:06.009 --> 38:08.676
-Tommy.
-Whoa.

38:08.695 --> 38:10.120
-Nicky Roman.
-Hey.

38:10.271 --> 38:12.104
-Yeah?
-You're a person of interest

38:12.198 --> 38:13.665
in the disappearance
of your husband Clive Grayson.

38:15.276 --> 38:16.668
We're gonna need to bring
you in for questioning.

38:25.879 --> 38:26.803
(siren whoops)

38:27.030 --> 38:29.881
(indistinct radio chatter)

38:30.033 --> 38:31.957
You son of a bitch.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.476
-Something wrong?
-Hey, whoa, whoa,

38:33.628 --> 38:36.220
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I got it.

38:36.373 --> 38:39.057
Albie, there something
you want to say to me?

38:39.209 --> 38:40.800
You know damn well

38:40.819 --> 38:42.968
Nicky had nothing to do
with Clive's going missing.

38:42.988 --> 38:45.713
You're just using her
to pressure me

38:45.732 --> 38:47.306
into confessing.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.993
Is this about your campaign
for governor?

38:53.056 --> 38:54.998
Well, Albie,

38:55.225 --> 38:57.575
politics is a dirty business.

38:57.669 --> 39:01.062
And sometimes,
if you want to be a big fish,

39:01.155 --> 39:03.489
you got to land a big fish.

39:03.583 --> 39:06.009
Still...

39:06.160 --> 39:08.069
a man with as many secrets
as you got

39:08.088 --> 39:10.905
might ought to be careful
about who he threatens.

39:10.998 --> 39:12.924
So let me ask you something.

39:13.076 --> 39:14.926
What's the play here?

39:15.078 --> 39:18.504
You gonna go public
with a 40-year-old story?

39:18.523 --> 39:21.524
How some kid fresh
out of juvie took the fall

39:21.676 --> 39:23.693
for the future governor
of our great state?

39:27.941 --> 39:30.492
Damn you, Tripp.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.112
Let her go.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.374
-I'll turn myself in tomorrow.
-Yeah?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.461
Cut her loose.

39:42.697 --> 39:44.506
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.598
Come on, Nicolette.

39:55.042 --> 39:57.418
Come on, come on in.

39:57.545 --> 39:59.020
Come on.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.813
Turn yourself in?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.633
What? Y-You can't.
I won't let you.

40:11.726 --> 40:13.576
Tripp's right about one thing.

40:13.769 --> 40:15.078
I did it. I killed the bastard.

40:15.229 --> 40:16.746
Before he killed me and you.

40:16.973 --> 40:18.322
What? There must be another way.

40:18.475 --> 40:20.308
There's not. There's not.

40:20.401 --> 40:24.328
Look, I've had plenty
of regrets in my life.

40:24.481 --> 40:27.907
But Clive, he ain't one of 'em.

40:28.001 --> 40:29.984
He had it coming.
And I can live with that.

40:30.077 --> 40:31.428
It don't matter where I am.

40:33.006 --> 40:36.081

How Clive attacked you.
