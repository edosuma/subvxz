WEBVTT

00:57.474 --> 00:59.142
-<i>Hello.</i>
- Hello.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.562
Mum, listen, I--

01:01.645 --> 01:07.568
I know we asked you to give us some space,
and thank you so much for respecting that,

01:07.651 --> 01:09.611
but, we don't have any proper food.

01:09.695 --> 01:14.032
And I was just wondering
if you'd be able to make us something?

01:14.116 --> 01:15.242
<i>Yeah, of course we can.</i>

01:15.325 --> 01:17.995
<i>Maybe a shepherd's pie and a casserole?
And maybe a trifle?</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:20.539
- Yeah, great. Is that okay?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

01:20.622 --> 01:21.915
- Okay.
-<i>Love you.</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:24.126
Okay. All right. Thank you. Love you. Bye.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.178
- That was quick.
- Well, we were just passing.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.306
- There's the shepherd's pie.
- Oh, Mum.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.933
I didn't know if they were vegan,
so I did a vegan option.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.561
- Right. Is it--
- Just some potato, yeah.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.105
Yay.

01:46.899 --> 01:47.941
Lovely.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.027
Thank you so much.
Honestly, this is plenty though.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.737
- You don't need to do any more.
- Okay.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.655
I mean it, Mom. I know what you're like.

01:53.739 --> 01:54.740
And we brought you some books

01:54.823 --> 01:57.326
for the kids.
I used to read them when I was little.

02:00.704 --> 02:03.123
- We crossed out all the racist bits.
- Right.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.376
Okay.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.422
- Okay.
- So, all okay?

02:10.506 --> 02:11.840
How was your first night?

02:11.924 --> 02:15.469
Yeah, great. But we don't know
what's happening yet though, so--

02:15.552 --> 02:18.514
I wanted to give you something special.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.266
My mum's mum gave it to her,
my mum gave it to me,

02:21.350 --> 02:24.061
and now I want you to have it.

02:26.897 --> 02:27.898
It's a--

02:28.732 --> 02:29.775
Oh, no.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.611
I must have left it at the services.

02:34.613 --> 02:35.614
Okay.

03:04.977 --> 03:05.811
What's all this?

03:06.854 --> 03:08.814
What-- Well,
I'm just-- I'm childproofing it.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.857
Oh, yeah? Okay.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.692
So, any news?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.278
Someone called Noah's gonna be ringing.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.863
Apparently, it's been kicked up to him.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.531
Okay. All right.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.533
- Jase?
- Yeah?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.202
I really wanna keep him.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.621
- Nikki.
- I mean it. I've thought it all through.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.706
- Oh, yeah? Have you?
- Yeah.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.332
All right. What's the plan?

03:27.416 --> 03:29.835
Well, we keep him and it--
Well, it just all works out.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.255
- Right, okay. All bases covered then.
- Maybe they'll just forget he's here.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.966
What? It's the council.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.051
Jase, when I was a kid,
they left a fridge in a park

03:38.135 --> 03:40.220
for four-and-a-half years
before anyone collected it.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.471
It ended up on the maps.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.849
No one's forgetting about this fridge.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.852
- Hi.
- Bloody hell.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.438
That's gonna take getting used to.
It's like the flipping <i>Shining</i>.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.814
- Hiya.
- Hello.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.650
- Do you wanna stick on the telly?
- Do you watch the telly?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.619
- Maybe we should make some breakfast.
- Yeah.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.078
- I'll unwrap the cooker.
- Okay.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.670
No, thank you very much. Okay, bye-bye.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.757
That was quick.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.219
Well, there wasn't a lot of discussion.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.637
They're coming to get him.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.013
Right.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.015
But did you tell them
that we wanna keep him?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.267
- It doesn't work like that, apparently.
- Did you argue with them?

04:27.351 --> 04:29.311
- As much as I could.
- No, but we're doing fine.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.396
- It's only been one night.
- It's better than they did.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.315
They had him for one night,
and they lost him.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.362
- They wanna stay together.
- I know.

04:39.655 --> 04:40.906
What time are they coming?

04:41.907 --> 04:43.075
Lunchtime.

04:43.659 --> 04:46.119
I hope that you told them
that in this house

04:46.203 --> 04:48.080
we eat lunch at ten o'clock at night.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.457
On Thursday.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.715
I made a bed.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.760
- What? Why?
- Two kids, you need two beds.

05:01.844 --> 05:04.555
Hang on, you made a bed
before eight in the morning?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.139
No, I made two.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.351
But I looked at the first one,
and I knew I had a better one in me.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.936
How'd you even make a bed?

05:11.937 --> 05:13.355
I don't understand the question.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.066
- Well, do you want the bed or not?
- Yeah.

05:16.900 --> 05:17.901
I've got it.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.154
- Don't put your back out.
- No, it's already out.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.906
- Got it?
- Yeah.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.867
Your mum will be around in a bit.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.411
She's doing a fun run she couldn't cancel.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.247
If you talk to her,
I was limping quite badly. All right?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.957
All right, mate. He's made us a bed. Look.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.876
- It's eight in the morning.
- Yeah. We've done all that.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.294
It's the middle of the day.

05:35.794 --> 05:38.422
Well, we don't need it.
They're taking him back.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.007
- Why?
- Well…

05:40.090 --> 05:42.134
We don't have the experience, apparently.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.677
Well, is there nothing you can do?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.180
- Apparently not.
- No. Hiya.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.390
- What are we doing now?
- Do you w--

05:48.473 --> 05:50.267
- Do you wanna go and get dressed?
- Okay.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.394
- Then we can go out for the day.
- Good girl.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.815
Okay, well, what's the plan?

05:56.899 --> 06:00.152
Well, we just have as nice a morning
as we can. That's all we can do, isn't it?

06:00.235 --> 06:02.196
How-- Jase, how is that all we can do?

06:02.279 --> 06:06.074
Because that's reality, isn't it?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.660
At the moment, we live in the gap

06:08.744 --> 06:11.246
between the way things are
and the way things should be,

06:11.330 --> 06:12.372
so in the meantime,

06:12.456 --> 06:17.503
all we can do is try
and make that space as lovely as we can.

06:17.586 --> 06:22.674
Well, someone really needs to
look into closing that gap.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.471
If we can only be his parents for one day,
then let's make it count.

06:27.554 --> 06:31.016
Let's prepare him, huh?

06:32.184 --> 06:34.603
'Cause he's not leaving the house
in a bloody Ramones T-shirt.

06:35.354 --> 06:36.355
That's my favorite one.

06:36.438 --> 06:37.439
Stop it.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.442
It's all right.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.618
Let's just try
and give him the best morning we can.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.954
Unbelievable.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.165
Dad, you all right?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.333
I'm not having it.

07:07.678 --> 07:08.804
Dad?

07:09.847 --> 07:11.682
What's the matter? You all right?

07:11.765 --> 07:14.351
The bloody council.
I've had it up to here.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.688
They come for the twice-weekly
rubbish collection, I say nothing.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.899
Then they come for the free
residents' parking. I say nothing.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.651
But I draw the line
when they come for him.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.736
Well, there's nothing we can do, is there?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.114
It's all layers now.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.742
- Safeguarding, best practices, all that.
- Oh, for God's sake.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.413
This is the reason there's
no overtaking in Formula 1 anymore.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.125
Hard to say, but okay.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.209
Is anything any better

07:39.293 --> 07:42.838
for all the best practicing
and safeguarding?

07:42.921 --> 07:45.257
Is anyone any happier?
Is anyone any safer?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.843
I don't know. I did use to play with
the mercury from a thermometer

07:47.926 --> 07:50.012
- when I was a kid.
- Only as a treat. Not every day.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.098
Look, don't do anything stupid.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.142
This is the council.
They know where you live.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.310
Maybe they can tell the people

07:56.393 --> 07:57.811
that are supposed to be coming
for my bins.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.647
Look.

08:01.732 --> 08:04.943
You don't get to pick your parents,
and you don't get to pick your kids.

08:06.236 --> 08:09.698
But somehow, you've picked him,
and he's picked you back.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.076
If I'm gonna be his parent for one day,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.455
then I don't wanna waste it
arguing on the phone.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.707
I wanna spend it being his dad.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.252
I just gotta make the best of things.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.047
I'm sick of making the best of things.
I'm sick of giving in.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.882
All right. Just don't do anything stupid.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.928
Don't forget your limp.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.722
- Other leg.
- Yeah, all right.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.328
Have you seen my holiday fedora, my love?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.330
No.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.375
And you should not have so many fedoras
that you need prefixes.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.212
The ideal number is zero fedoras.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.799
Hi. It's me, Vic.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.385
Vic Ross. Jason's dad.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.762
Yeah. I know who you are, Vic.
What's happened?

09:13.846 --> 09:15.556
Are you busy? I need your help.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.393
And I found this hidden in your hedge.
I don't know why.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.900
- Well, come in.
- Thanks.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.697
So, where are we going then?

09:31.780 --> 09:35.075
Well, we need to get him a proper coat.
And a wash bag.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.994
I don't wanna go shopping, Nik.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.037
Fine, you can stay
in the food court while I go.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.331
But honestly, this has got to stop.
You're a grown man.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.334
I mean I don't wanna go shopping now.
I don't wanna waste this time.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.296
Yeah.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.506
Well, what should we do?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.801
I don't know. What do you do
if you wanna have fun really quickly?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.636
It's just hard, isn't it,
'cause they can't drink.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.513
That's it. That is the go-to, isn't it?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.558
Okay. Right. Okay.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.684
I'm just gonna say it

10:00.767 --> 10:02.978
so it's out of my head
and I can get past it.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.062
Swim with dolphins.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.147
I know it's wrong.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.567
I don't have my swimming costume with me,
and there are no dolphins in North London.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.778
Both good points,
arguably in the wrong order, but--

10:11.862 --> 10:14.239
So, what's the closest thing
to swimming with dolphins,

10:14.323 --> 10:16.825
in North London,
that we can do in an hour and a half?

10:18.952 --> 10:19.953
What?

10:20.537 --> 10:21.788
Okay, so…

10:21.872 --> 10:24.041
Hang on, we haven't got much time,
so let's prioritize.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.960
We'll leave the giraffes
'cause we can just see them from outside.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.047
- So, I'm thinking elephants and gorillas.
- Yep. Australian wood duck.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.466
- What?
- I like to see the less popular ones.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.218
They'll be so surprised to see us.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.427
What's your favorite animals?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.720
- Cat.
- Dinosaur.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.264
Okay. Well, that's an excellent use
of a hundred quid. Come on.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.400
All right, look.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.277
Jase.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
Oh, yeah.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.701
Check out the lion. Look. Careful.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.790
That lion is the biggest one.

11:06.375 --> 11:07.918
- Gorgeous. Look.
- Oh, my God.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.171
Look at that one in there.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.983
Oh, God. What's happened?

11:32.109 --> 11:35.404
- Jilly, get your coat. We got to go out.
- Why?

11:35.487 --> 11:38.198
- Something about a gap needing closing.
- But I'm mid-peel on the spuds.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.159
Never mind the spuds, girl,
this is an emergency.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.375
I will just cover them up though.
They are Jersey Royals.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.210
Don't want to attract burglars.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.675
Do you think they're having fun?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.594
Well, it's hard to tell.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.888
- I'm talking about the kids.
- I know.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.640
Can we watch when they feed them?

12:06.101 --> 12:09.438
- Oh, no. We have to leave by then.
- Please.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.149
I'm so sorry. We can't.

12:14.443 --> 12:16.069
They said no.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.994
I'll go and see if I can find someone
to do it earlier. All right?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.427
Oh, my God.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.729
Tyler, look at that one.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.107
- Jase, we're gonna get in trouble.
- No, it's fine. I got the jacket.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.817
This answers questions
before they're asked.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.569
Bit like an amp at a festival.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.613
Stick one under your arm,
you can go anywhere you like.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.406
No, don't tell him that.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.617
I've only got a few hours
to tell him everything I know.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.577
That seems plenty.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.206
Right. Let's have a look. Look, kids.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.960
Did you know, penguins, they give
small rocks to each other as presents?

13:13.043 --> 13:14.127
Why?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.547
I don't know.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.925
Maybe they don't know
how to say "I love you" yet,

13:20.008 --> 13:21.760
so that's just what they do.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.477
- Do you look after the penguins?
- Yes, mate. Yeah.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.729
So, what sort of penguins are these?

13:32.813 --> 13:34.064
These? These ones here?

13:35.107 --> 13:39.152
These are your classic penguins.
Your original. Standard ones.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.365
Oh, right. And what sort
of other penguins are there, then?

13:44.157 --> 13:46.368
- Emperor.
- The one that everyone knows?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.329
Viscount…

13:50.414 --> 13:53.709
Earl, Baron and Dame.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.419
How big do they grow?

13:57.087 --> 13:59.840
Regular, large, and then you got
your extra-large at the top.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.133
How long do they live for?

14:01.216 --> 14:02.843
All right, mate, keep it light.
Just a bit of fun.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.266
Tell you what, we should go.
The penguins are tired.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.101
They're jet-lagged.
Still on southern hemisphere time.

14:11.185 --> 14:13.562
Come on, kids. Sorry. Thank you.

14:16.398 --> 14:20.569
Okay, everyone.
Welcome to the Charity Five for Life 5K.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.695
Get yourselves lined up.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.988
I don't think I can do this.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.365
On your marks.

14:27.618 --> 14:29.077
Get set.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.622
Wait! Wait, sorry.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.165
Wait, don't go.

14:33.749 --> 14:34.583
Vic?

14:35.167 --> 14:38.420
It's Jason and Nikki. They need us.

14:42.758 --> 14:43.675
Morning.

14:46.178 --> 14:48.263
Okay, I need to tell you something,
man to man.

14:48.889 --> 14:53.310
Now, we don't have much time together,
so listen up.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.854
If ever you grow a mustache,
grow the whole beard as well.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.482
- Never just the mustache. Okay?
- Okay.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.776
That is the sort of thing
people never tell you.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.320
- Thanks.
- It's all right. Got more if you want.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.161
Are you okay?

15:12.663 --> 15:13.580
Yeah.

15:13.664 --> 15:18.293
I know this must be so tough for you
but no matter how it feels,

15:18.377 --> 15:21.296
nothing is as good or as bad
as it seems at first.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.424
Most things just turn into okay.

15:24.508 --> 15:27.177
Is that useful? I don't know.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.305
Do you want some more bad advice?

15:31.014 --> 15:32.015
Yeah? Okay.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.643
Never wear white socks
past the age of twelve,

15:34.726 --> 15:37.563
and I'm afraid there is no leeway
on that whatsoever.

15:37.646 --> 15:39.648
Never trust a therapist
who has housemates.

15:40.232 --> 15:42.985
Only talk to yourself the way
you'd talk to a friend that you love.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.404
All the buttons on a microwave
do exactly the same thing,

15:45.487 --> 15:46.989
so don't waste your time. Press anything.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.908
And tidy your house
before you go on holiday.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.744
You'll forget you've done it,
and it's so nice when you get back home.

15:52.828 --> 15:55.956
Only wear a football shirt on match day.
Otherwise, it's weird.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.374
Do you like football?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.293
I support Spurs. Who do you support?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.545
- Yeah, Spurs.
- Yeah?

16:01.628 --> 16:02.629
Go on.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.382
Never order seafood from a menu
with a spelling mistake on it.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.428
Don't go food shopping when you're hungry
or date when you're lonely.

16:10.596 --> 16:13.098
You'll just end up bringing home
something you don't need.

16:13.182 --> 16:16.476
Only start singing the well-known bit
of a song if you know the rest.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.811
Otherwise, you'll look silly.

16:17.895 --> 16:20.772
Always give a roast chicken
an extra 20 minutes.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.984
Oh, yes. Learn how to meditate.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.485
What's that?

16:25.569 --> 16:28.405
It's something young people do
instead of going to church.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.742
You basically wanna be more fish
and less meerkat.

16:31.825 --> 16:36.788
Fish have terrible memories,
they live in the moment, they're chilled.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.790
Meerkats are worriers.

16:42.628 --> 16:44.421
I think you're a little bit meerkat.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.758
They're always on the lookout for danger.

16:49.593 --> 16:53.931
Even now, when they're in the zoo,
when they're somewhere safe.

16:54.431 --> 16:58.310
It's hard to convince them
to let other people look out for them.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.647
Come here.

17:04.942 --> 17:05.943
And…

17:06.902 --> 17:07.903
be bold, mate.

17:08.487 --> 17:11.865
If someone from the future doesn't
come back to tell you to stop doing it,

17:11.949 --> 17:13.867
then how badly could it have gone?
You know?

17:15.827 --> 17:16.912
Come on, then.

17:20.832 --> 17:22.835
- That was all right, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

17:22.917 --> 17:25.462
- Yeah, and I passed on a lot of my wisdom.
- Oh, God.

17:25.546 --> 17:28.173
I'm just pleased we got outta there
without having to explain sex to anyone.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.345
Do you think he knows we care?

17:33.428 --> 17:35.973
- I was going to get the orange, but…
- I think so. Yeah.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.224
Yeah, me too.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.645
Come on, then.
Noah's gonna be there soon,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.856
and we still need to buy some things
for Tyler.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.400
What flavor did we go for again?

17:46.483 --> 17:47.568
I got black currant.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.194
- Black currant.
- Yeah, snaps.

18:04.918 --> 18:05.919
Hello.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.130
<i>Shut up!</i>

18:09.339 --> 18:10.340
<i>Shush!</i>

18:11.216 --> 18:12.217
<i>You busy?</i>

18:13.719 --> 18:15.804
I suppose I can move some stuff around.

18:15.888 --> 18:17.472
One, two, three!

18:17.556 --> 18:18.724
My arm.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.684
- One, two, three!
-…two, three!

18:20.767 --> 18:22.311
One more big one,

18:22.394 --> 18:24.479
over the clouds! Yeah!

18:24.563 --> 18:27.149
All right, let's get in.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.067
You're a bit big for that.
You too big for that?

18:29.151 --> 18:30.444
- Can I have one?
- Yeah.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.154
- Can I have two?
- Yeah.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.072
- Three? I'll have four.
- Jase?

18:34.156 --> 18:34.990
Yeah?

18:35.073 --> 18:37.242
- You said we were gonna fix this.
- What?

18:37.326 --> 18:38.785
We had a lot going on, Nikki.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.788
What?

18:44.208 --> 18:45.417
What is going on?

19:02.059 --> 19:03.018
What's happening?

19:03.101 --> 19:04.394
Show of force.

19:04.478 --> 19:07.231
When something's not right,
it's not right.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.485
- Vic.
- Mate.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.659
Oh, God.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.994
What's Terry doing here?

19:21.078 --> 19:23.080
Well, Jen was busy. We needed numbers.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.208
That's fine, it's just a bit awkward.
I called in sick for work.

19:32.256 --> 19:33.257
S--

19:36.301 --> 19:38.053
What?

19:38.929 --> 19:39.930
Are you ready?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.807
Okay, quick lesson.
Let's turn this thing on…

19:41.890 --> 19:43.392
- I've got Tyler some pajamas.
- Ready?

19:43.475 --> 19:45.686
They might be a bit big for him.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.979
And I brought some of the

19:47.062 --> 19:50.357
left-over wedding canapés.
I didn't know how many people would come.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.485
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on your honeymoon.

19:53.569 --> 19:57.364
Yes, but apparently there's some guy
doesn't think my sister's amazing.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.199
I can't have that stand.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.702
And Scott was in charge of the honeymoon,

20:01.785 --> 20:04.037
so if we miss it,
it's not the end of the world.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.790
Come here. I love you.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.375
Yeah. All right.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.585
Ready? Go.

20:13.839 --> 20:17.718
Our honeymoon, I was saying.
Yes, it's very exciting actually.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.721
A tour of the Baroque libraries
of Stuttgart.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.805
Thank you for asking.

20:22.514 --> 20:26.101
Actually some of the finest examples
outside the Iberian Peninsula.

20:27.352 --> 20:28.979
What does "Baroque" mean?

20:33.525 --> 20:35.527
So, how old are you?

20:36.028 --> 20:37.821
What's your favorite architect?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.699
Yay.

20:41.867 --> 20:43.368
Not you and all, Mum?

20:43.452 --> 20:45.245
It's just a few bits.

20:45.329 --> 20:47.247
I'm clearing out a spare room anyway.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.082
Making a meditation room.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.294
Well,
I'm putting in a foot spa and a telly.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.048
- Thanks, Mum.
- A bit more food.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.549
Oh, Dad.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.302
- Bloody hell.
- We welcome feedback.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.679
But I'll be honest,
we won't do anything differently.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.848
- Right.
- And we found it,

21:04.932 --> 21:06.225
the thing we were gonna give you.

21:07.309 --> 21:10.020
I mean, it's a bit silly,
but it was always a real comfort to me.

21:10.938 --> 21:11.980
Mum.

21:14.525 --> 21:17.486
What do you think, Jase?
I mean, I don't know.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.489
How is this gonna look?

21:21.990 --> 21:23.742
Well, this is what love looks like.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.078
That's Noah.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.586
So, you're the man
trying to take away my grandson.

21:36.004 --> 21:37.965
We are resettling Tyler
if that's what you mean.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.679
They haven't been approved for two.
They lack the support and experience.

21:43.762 --> 21:46.181
There's 200 years' worth
of experience here.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.893
These people won't be around
for every second of every crisis.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.812
You don't know my family very well,
do you?

21:52.479 --> 21:53.981
Well, get used to 'em,

21:54.064 --> 21:57.818
because we'll be outside your office
every day till you bring him back.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.445
Don't mess with the grandparents.

22:00.529 --> 22:03.156
We've not got jobs,
and we sleep three hours a night.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.660
That one is not on us.
I don't know what happened there.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.453
- All right. That's--
- This is my son.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.122
He's the best of me.

22:10.789 --> 22:13.750
And if his son is the improvement on him
that he is on me,

22:13.834 --> 22:14.918
then he'll do wonders.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.505
Look, I like a party
as much as the next man,

22:18.589 --> 22:20.507
but this is not how decisions are made.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.640
Okay, shall we pop inside,
get your things?

22:31.685 --> 22:32.686
Come on.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.531
- Arancini ball?
- No, thank you.

22:56.710 --> 22:59.796
- So, had a busy day?
- Yeah.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.757
What did you do?

23:01.840 --> 23:04.968
We went to the zoo,
and Jason taught me things.

23:06.261 --> 23:10.307
"Never buy the first round,
because some people leave early."

23:12.809 --> 23:14.853
And then we came home.

23:32.871 --> 23:36.375
If you think taking these children away is
the hardest thing I do,

23:36.458 --> 23:39.753
then you've not been there
when they get given back.

23:39.837 --> 23:41.964
- No, we wouldn't give them--
- It gets harder than this.

23:42.548 --> 23:46.260
- This is the honeymoon period.
- Noah, we're ready.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.681
In 12 weeks,
you'll need to go before the judge

23:50.764 --> 23:52.516
and convince them you can handle this.

23:53.976 --> 23:57.104
Think very carefully.
You need to be sure about this.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.731
We can keep him?

24:12.077 --> 24:14.371
Twelve weeks to become a family.

24:15.122 --> 24:16.248
We've done harder things.

24:17.833 --> 24:20.002
I mean, nothing springs to mind,
to be fair.

24:20.085 --> 24:21.086
But--

24:22.921 --> 24:23.922
Hey, Nikki.

24:24.006 --> 24:26.466
Hey, listen…

24:29.261 --> 24:30.429
I'm gonna quit my job.

24:31.180 --> 24:35.642
And I'm gonna stay at home,
and I'm gonna look after them.

24:36.602 --> 24:40.147
Okay? 'Cause, well, I hate my job,
and you love yours.

24:41.023 --> 24:42.691
It just-- It makes sense.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.697
Look at them both, like angels.

24:49.281 --> 24:50.866
What the hell have we done?

24:53.243 --> 24:56.246
We closed the gap for a bit, that's all.
