WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.833
JO: He was just
crossing the road, and...

00:02.961 --> 00:04.917
CARTER: This is what happens
when you don't look both ways.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.120
(DOG WHIMPERING)
He's lost a lot of blood.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.835
Why don't we take him
to a real vet?
We are the best in the world.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.462
He's got a lab
in Section Three.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.928
Hey, hear that, buddy?

00:12.012 --> 00:15.925
We're going to fix you
right up. Yeah.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.552
FARGO: You're going
to love this.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.346
Well, after three years
of development, I hope so.

00:20.395 --> 00:22.056
Have you decided
on a name yet?

00:22.147 --> 00:25.014
I like Mental Mouse,
because it forms
a direct neural link

00:25.108 --> 00:28.191
between your cerebral cortex
and the computer main frame.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.943
Bluetooth for the brain.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.691
It looks like a melanoma.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.860
That's because
it's not turned on.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.906
So this transmits my thoughts
directly to the computer.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.201
That's right.
No need for a keyboard
or a mouse.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.828
You think it here,
it comes out there.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.044
Fantastic,
except it doesn't work.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.962
What do you mean?

00:53.053 --> 00:56.216
Well, I'm trying to access
your personnel file
and it's not working.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.384
Why are you trying
to access my file?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.264
To see if you're
remotely qualified

01:00.352 --> 01:02.138
to be tapping into
my cerebral cortex.

01:02.312 --> 01:05.395
It's not working
because it hasn't finished
mapping your brain yet.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.396
In an hour or so
things will start popping up

01:07.484 --> 01:09.600
before you even know
you want them.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.440
Now, these lines represent
different emotions.

01:12.531 --> 01:15.489
Red for anger,
blue for happiness,
green for depression.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.818
So you've equipped me
with a very expensive
mood ring.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.486
I'll take it from here.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.741
It's not a mood ring.

01:21.790 --> 01:24.577
lt maps emotions
to better convert
brain activity into commands.

01:24.668 --> 01:25.748
If you think about it...

01:25.836 --> 01:27.952
Fargo, look at the screen.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.923
Yeah,
you can take it from here.

01:33.969 --> 01:35.505
My thoughts exactly.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.553
CARTER: Taggart's
your world renowned vet?

01:38.599 --> 01:42.308
Graduated magna from
the University of Melbourne.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.930
I thought you were
a crypto zoologist.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.678
Well, the study
of unknown species
is more of a hobby.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.936
Which means he knows
more about animals
than any normal vet.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.852
It means
he knows more about
pretend animals.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.026
I can't fix this.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.399
Okay, let's take him
to a real doctor.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.485
No, I said I can't fix it,

01:58.619 --> 02:00.701
but my little friends can.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.362
You've made friends
with sand now?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.449
Not sand. Nanoids.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.165
Remember Carl Carlson?

02:11.256 --> 02:13.338
We've been able
to reverse engineer

02:13.425 --> 02:16.041
some of his discoveries
about cellular regeneration

02:16.136 --> 02:18.468
and adapt them
to nanotechnology.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.298
Normally l'm opposed
to animal testing,

02:22.559 --> 02:25.050
but in this case,
I'll make an exception.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.020
So, you're going
to treat Lowjack
with itsy, bitsy robots?

02:29.107 --> 02:31.598
They've been programmed
to analyze and mimic

02:31.652 --> 02:34.985
biological structures
such as bone,
tissue and hair.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.698
They're activated
and controlled

02:43.789 --> 02:46.872
by ultra low
frequency radio signals.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.701
Man, that's a little creepy.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.082
Told you he was good.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.919
Their programming is simple.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.423
Repair and replicate,
just like human cells.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.092
They'll serve
as sort of a living Band-Aid

03:03.183 --> 03:04.548
until his tissues can heal.

03:04.643 --> 03:07.680
I assume I can trust you
to let Lowjack go
once he's healed?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.728
There's no sport
in catching him
in this condition.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.517
Scout's honor.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.400
There are no scouts
in Australia.

03:16.488 --> 03:20.106
Yeah, there are.
And believe me,
in the outback,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.691
you'll learn how to do
a lot more
than tie knots.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.242
I could tell you stories...

03:24.329 --> 03:26.320
CARTER: Prefer you didn't.
Just take care of the dog.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.613
Will do, Sheriff.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.032
See you, Jo.
Later, Tag.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.914
Tag?
Shutup.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.836
Tag.
Shut up.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.176
I've got you now,
my furry friend.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.226
All the years
you've tormented me.
Mocked me.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.479
But look who's laughing now.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.401
All right.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.695
Truce then.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.744
Butjust till
you're up and about.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.456
Dr. Stark?
Kind of busy, Larry.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.542
Are you having
any computer problems?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.383
Not till now.
Yeah.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.632
You should probably
get that mole checked.
Could be a melanoma.

04:28.727 --> 04:29.967
Do you need something, Larry?

04:30.061 --> 04:32.268
I picked up a computer glitch
in this area.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.098
It may require shutting down
sections of the main frame
to isolate the problem.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.437
I'll need your authorization.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.648
It's always something.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.775
Just pray it's not
the Lorena Bobbitt virus.

04:42.824 --> 04:43.813
I'm sorry?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.236
It turns your hard drive
into a three and a half inch
ﬂoppy.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.826
(LAUGHING)

04:52.959 --> 04:54.369
Guess I'll get to it, then?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.450
Please.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.639
Lorena Bobbitt virus.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.519
Kills me every time.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.860
I still remember
our first encounter.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.658
There we go.

05:29.287 --> 05:34.407
lronic that animal testing
created you,
and now it saved you.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.461
But for a dog
with 130 IQ,

05:39.756 --> 05:41.872
you should know
to watch out for cars.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.259
You need to pay
closer attention, mate.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.714
You'll wind up dead.

05:49.641 --> 05:52.007
That's how I've survived
all these years.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.356

06:31.766 --> 06:32.755

06:33.310 --> 06:35.221

It's not working.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.351
It keeps bringing up stuff
I'm not even looking for.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.550
FARGO: (ON SCREEN)
Like what?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.093
What difference
does that make?

07:18.188 --> 07:20.725
The subconscious
is extremely open
to suggestion.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.891
When I ﬁrst tried it out,
it kept bringing up
Buffy fan sites,

07:23.944 --> 07:28.153
which I ’m total/y not into.
Even on a subconscious level.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.740
Am I interrupting something?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.525
Actual/y, Dr. Stark and]
were discussing a prob...

07:32.619 --> 07:33.984
Not even remotely.

07:34.621 --> 07:38.455
If you're here to invite me
to the Lise Meitner dance,

07:38.541 --> 07:39.951
I might still be available.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.578
Okay, you are not here
to invite me to the dance.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.620
No.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.336
What's in the envelope?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.805
Oh.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.069
And | see
you've signed them.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.857
| just thought
that seeing where we are
right now,

08:16.079 --> 08:17.990
that maybe it was time.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.154
Okay.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.703
I mean,
unless you think that...

08:22.794 --> 08:25.206
I think
we should've done this
a long time ago.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.673
I've just gotten so busy,

08:27.757 --> 08:30.590

get lost in the shuffle.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.839
Little things. Right.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.847
And with everything
that's happened
between you and Carter...

08:36.891 --> 08:39.382
This has nothing to do
with Carter.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.849
Well, I'll just put them
in your box when I'm done.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.114
Fine, I guess
that's it then.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.158
Unless there's something else
you needed.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.193
No.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.198
I think I got what I came for.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.896
And remember, Jo,
call me in two minutes.
Not a second more.

09:28.234 --> 09:29.223
Hi!

09:30.528 --> 09:31.779
What are you doing here?

09:31.863 --> 09:33.899
Helping set up for the dance.
What are you doing here?

09:33.948 --> 09:34.937
Sound check.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.022
For?

09:36.785 --> 09:40.243
The finale.
I represent the band.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.159
You represent the band?

09:43.291 --> 09:45.498
Spencer.
You know, he's actually
a really good musician.

09:45.627 --> 09:49.290
Groundbreaking beats.
Like Moby meets Devo.

09:49.380 --> 09:53.373
Moby, Devo, Spencer.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.292
No, not feeling it.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.256
We're still working
on a stage name.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.216
But I have him booked
Monday nights at Cafe Diem,

09:59.307 --> 10:01.389

with iTunes.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.773
How you doing?

10:11.820 --> 10:12.935
How you doing?
All right.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.894
So, you got roped into this
too, huh?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.485
This is Eureka's
most important event
of the year.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.486
Are you really here
to help set up?

10:19.786 --> 10:22.653
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'd like nothing more.

10:22.789 --> 10:26.498
HENRY: In that case,
and on behalf
of Lise Meitner,

10:29.462 --> 10:30.451
I thank you.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.372
And if I knew who that was,
that might mean something.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.173
She was an Austrian physicist
who discovered
nuclear fission,

10:36.302 --> 10:40.011
which then led
to the invention
of the atomic bomb.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.465
Oh, well, by all means,
let's celebrate that.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.383
Meitner refused
to work on the bomb, Dad.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.513
Oh.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.890
Tonight's dance is a tribute
to her ingenuity,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.142
not what others
chose to do with it.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.312
Her passion for exploration,
her commitment
to bettering the world

10:53.403 --> 10:56.816
is the ideal Eureka is meant
to strive to meet.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.362
That's what
we're celebrating.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.825
And celebrate we shall.

telling yourself that.

part of the call.

What did he say?
Nice.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.862
Not that I don't enjoy
your company, but why?

13:06.953 --> 13:08.409
He's one of
my dearest friends.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.366
Really?
Are we talking about
the same Larry?

13:17.130 --> 13:21.294
Just because you choose
not to fraternize
with the support staff,

13:21.342 --> 13:23.173
doesn't mean others don't.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.668
Which is your loss,

13:24.762 --> 13:28.129
because Larry happens to be
a very sensitive guy.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.182
You want to try out
one of your new toys,
don't you?

13:35.565 --> 13:39.649
I got a new GPS locator
and night-vision goggles.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.978
I brought my hand-me-downs
for you.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.440
Lucky me.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.034
CARTER: Watch your head.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.118
(GROANS)

14:05.887 --> 14:07.297
TAGGART: See anything?

14:08.765 --> 14:11.256
It's a long dark tunnel.
Not really.

14:12.602 --> 14:17.517
That's because you don't have
ultra infrared vision goggles.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.146
You got me there.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.777
It's not like Larry
to leave his post.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.271
I've got a bad feeling.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.445
Given where we are,
l have a bad feeling.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.405
About 10 more feet,
we should hit a junction.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.036
We can split up there.
Whoa. Hang on.

14:34.415 --> 14:37.498
Fine, you baby.
We'll stick together.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.791
But it's far more efficient
if we split up...

14:39.879 --> 14:42.416
Taggart! Shut up!
You shut up!

14:42.590 --> 14:43.750
Just listen.

14:45.676 --> 14:46.665
(BUZZING)

14:50.556 --> 14:51.545
What is that?

14:52.392 --> 14:53.882
Sounds insectoid.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.055
Is that even a word?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.183
Yeah, I think so.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.070
(BUZZING)

15:16.207 --> 15:17.743
What's that?
I don't know.

15:19.377 --> 15:20.617
But it got Larry.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.828
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ow!

15:23.923 --> 15:26.414
We're going to need
more firepower.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.626
Go. Carter.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.173
ALLISON: Hey, you guys
need to come back.
We have a problem.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.550
Yeah, more than one.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.136
(EXCLAIMS)

15:53.953 --> 15:57.195
ALLISON: A person is missing.
We found his equipment
in the service tunnel.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.996
I don't care if I'm missing.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.995
You don't go poking around
a billion dollar main frame
without asking me.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.790
And you do not send a cop
and a glorified vet

16:04.839 --> 16:07.797
into the brain
of Global Dynamics
without following protocol.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.249
They're not even
wearing clean suits.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.418
Well, Larry is still missing.
What do you propose
we do about it?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.177
I don't care what you do,

16:13.264 --> 16:16.597
just do not compromise
the safety of this facility
while you do it.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.179
Look, I didn't want
to go in there
in the first place.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.636
What is that?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.982
It's my threshold
for incompetence.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.727
It looks like a melanoma.

16:28.821 --> 16:29.810
Get out.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.489
CARTER: Your hubby
is in a mood.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.237
He's not my hubby anymore.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.990
I know, I know,
he's your estranged husband.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.742
No, I gave him
the divorce papers to sign,

16:40.833 --> 16:42.994
which is why
he's in the mood.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.327
Seriously?
Seriously.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.328
I'm just going to go
check on my pooch.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.501
Call me if you need me,
Shenﬁ.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.173
Yeah, I'll do that.

16:52.762 --> 16:53.842
Are you okay?

16:53.930 --> 16:55.761
Yeah, let's just focus
on Larry.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.171
Sure.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.465
We'll start
with the security footage

16:58.518 --> 17:00.600
and then we'll do
a floor by floor sweep.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.677
If he's in the building,
we'll find him.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.845
I'm fine.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.030
There you are.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.573
People are looking for you.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.866
(LOWJACK PANTING)

17:25.836 --> 17:26.825
Lowjack?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.712
How did you get out
of your cage?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.632
I told them
they were overreacting,

17:33.719 --> 17:36.335
but you should probably
tell them you're here.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.424
Get back here, you mutt!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.306
Where in the hell did he go?

17:58.869 --> 18:00.075
(BUZZING)

18:01.080 --> 18:02.195
Did you hear that?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.335
FARGO: The last footage
we have of Larry,

18:17.430 --> 18:20.422
he's entering
the service corridor,
then the abbreviated message.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.716
He never came out.
He must be
in there somewhere.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.597
I'm starting to wonder
what else is down there
with him.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.804
I've got an idea.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.850
Here's Lowjack
locked up in his cage,

18:32.945 --> 18:35.561
but I just saw him
up on Section One.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.151
At least I thought I did.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.481
He gave me the slip.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.283
That's the least
of our problems.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.113
You lost your nanobugs?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.624
I didn't lose them.
They escaped.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.917
Where did they go?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.372
Could they have
gone in there?

18:52.298 --> 18:53.879
That's where Larry went.
Taggan?

18:53.966 --> 18:57.129
I don't know how
they got out. They were in
deactivated sleep mode.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.961
It's not in their programming
to initiate commands.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.640
Well, can't you use
your remote control thingy
and make them march home?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.346
I tried that.
They're not responding.
They must be out of range.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.052
Then you need
to get within range.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.435
Inside the many miles
of dark, creepy service
tunnels. That's great.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.557
They can't get too far.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.735
The EM umbrella will
keep them inside Global.

19:15.821 --> 19:16.981
What? What's that?

19:17.031 --> 19:19.943
Global Dynamics is protected
by an electromagnetic barrier.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.493
It prevents anyone
from broadcasting

19:21.535 --> 19:23.321
any non-secured signals out
or sending them in.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.152
The nanoids can't
breach the barrier

19:25.247 --> 19:26.453
without frying
their circuitry.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.948
We just need
to get within range
of the remote control.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.912
You better get to it then.
Where are you going?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.504
To tell Nathan
I want to lock
the facility down.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.328
The less area they have
to move around in,

19:34.382 --> 19:35.588
the faster we'll be able
to catch them.

19:40.638 --> 19:41.753
Dr. Stark.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.344
Is there something
I can help you with?

19:53.776 --> 19:55.858
Dr. Stark,
what are you doing?

19:57.613 --> 20:00.025
Why are you deactivating
the EM barrier?

I need to initiate
security protocol lockdown,
level three.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.923
Dr. Stark is unavailable.
This is my call.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.511
(ALARM WAILING)

20:41.407 --> 20:43.693

Lock down.

we're stuck down here.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.780
Yeah.
Burst gun, just in case.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.417
Just in case what?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.699
Exactly.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.749
These nanoids, how many
were in there exactly?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.125
I don't know.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.958
They're programmed
to self-replicate

21:02.052 --> 21:05.044
using any available
source of carbon as fuel.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.303
Where would they
get the carbon?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.551
Is it in computer stuff?
Piping?

21:08.601 --> 21:11.308
Carbon is in anything living.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.429
l'm something living.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.722
So am I.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.358
This just gets
better and better.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.279
Nathan, where have you been?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.156
There's a situation.
Escaped nanotechnology.

21:30.247 --> 21:34.286
I had to put us on lockdown.
Carter and Taggart
are searching now.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.789
Okay, please don't give me
the silent treatment.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.956
It's obvious
that you're upset with me.
You know, I'm upset, too.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.713
Why don't we
just talk about it?

21:44.804 --> 21:47.295
Some indication
of how you're feeling
would be nice.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.184
That would be
an indication.

Nathan,
why is your skin so cold?

Mmm-hmm.

Got something.
Yeah?

22:23.467 --> 22:24.843
We're getting closer.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.344
I think we're there.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.300
What is it?

22:31.392 --> 22:34.304
It's their carbon source.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.195
If you have that nanoid

a really good time to use it.

22:53.998 --> 22:54.987
Anytime.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.323
I don't know
how to say this.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.456
It's not working.

22:58.544 --> 22:59.829
That's how.

(BEEPING)

23:03.465 --> 23:05.672

23:05.968 --> 23:09.426
Right there.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.890
Lowjack?

That's not Lowjack.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.636

Bad dog! Bad dog!

23:24.111 --> 23:27.023
There will never be
enough showers for me
to feel clean again.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.899
Did you know
that was going to happen?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.322
Absolutely not.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.482
Maybe a bit.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.952

Get the hell off me!

23:35.956 --> 23:38.538
Stop. Nathan,
what's wrong with you?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.371
Nathan, stop it! Nathan!

Nathan, stop it!

23:48.844 --> 23:50.880
Yeah.
That wasn't Nathan.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.340
What the hell
was that thing?

23:56.435 --> 23:59.268
Things. Taggart's nanoids
can apparently
make copies of us now.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.595
You've got to be
kidding me.

24:00.648 --> 24:02.434
No, they're on a binge.
We found Larry.

24:02.483 --> 24:03.472
Or what's left of him.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.598
He's dead?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.649
Devoured.
And they're using his body
as a carbon source.

24:06.737 --> 24:08.648
Then where's the real Nathan?

24:15.913 --> 24:19.076
COMPUTER VOICE: Caution.
Electromagnetic barrier
is disengaging.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.245
Dead or alive,
we have to find him.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.455
We will. I promise.
How do these things work?

24:24.546 --> 24:28.130
I mean, one is harmless,
but a million can eat Larry?

24:28.384 --> 24:30.295
It's called
distributed computing.

24:30.511 --> 24:33.093
Each individual nanoid
is like a brain cell.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.003
Now, the more there are,
the smarter they become.

24:35.099 --> 24:38.136
They communicate
with each other over
very low frequencies

24:38.227 --> 24:39.637
and share
the thinking workload.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.476
Yeah, but they're just
tiny computers, right?

24:41.563 --> 24:42.723
I mean,
they run off a program.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.351
Right. Repair and replicate.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.683
So they need fuel.
Exactly.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.400
Wow. Excellent.

24:49.488 --> 24:50.989
So, that's what
it was going to do?

24:51.073 --> 24:53.109
Take my carbon
and run around
looking like me?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.535
I don't think so. I mean,
the nano Stark
kissed you, right?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.655
I mean, kissing. That can't be
a part of their programming.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.032
No, but it shows
their exponential leap
in intelligence

25:00.124 --> 25:01.409
and a great taste in women.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.707
It knew it was me.
I could feel it.

25:03.794 --> 25:04.783
Okay.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.335
So Stark is the key,

25:06.505 --> 25:10.089
and that monitor in his office
is still working,
which means he's still alive.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.003
You're right.
Theyjust found him
in Section Three.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.508
Where is he?

25:13.595 --> 25:14.926
In the master control room.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.629
Thank God. Open the door.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.138
He's locked himself inside.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.471
No, he locked us outside,
or one of them has.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.260
You've got to get
this door open.
What's in this room?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.515
The computer main frame.

25:24.565 --> 25:26.396
Would the security system
be in there?

25:26.483 --> 25:28.690
And the EM barrier.
He could turn it off.
ALLISON: Not without help.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.772
Even with the codes,
it has to be
shut down manually

25:30.863 --> 25:32.069
from three different
entry points

25:32.156 --> 25:34.317
by someone
with full security clearance.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.355
Someone like Stark?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.234
All right. We're good.
All right. Back me up.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.838
Man.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.719
This is really bad.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.676
They've got Dr. Stark
at exit five.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.722
Wait, exit seven
and exit nine.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.064
Those are the shut off points.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.645
They're making a break for it.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.110
The EM barrier's down.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.271
There's nothing
to prevent them
leaving the building.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.903
Sir? All exit points
have been breached.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.908
We have multiple Starks
outside of the building.

26:20.954 --> 26:23.286
And I thought
one Stark was bad.

26:23.624 --> 26:25.364
There's no stopping them now.

26:43.644 --> 26:44.929
ALLISON:
We have to find them.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.718
TAGGART: They're replicating
exponenﬂaHy.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.728
You know the program.
What kind of numbers
are we talking about?

26:48.774 --> 26:50.685
By this time tomorrow,
there could be thousands.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.765
Next week, millions.

26:51.860 --> 26:54.146
Millions of Starks?
That's horrible
to think about.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.819
Well, we obviously
can't wait that long.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.442
Okay, weapons.
What do you have
that can knock them out?

26:57.491 --> 26:59.573
The EM burst guns
are short range.
We'll never get all of them.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.858
Do you have anything bigger?

27:00.953 --> 27:03.035
Aside from a nuclear bomb? No.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.328
You have a nuclear bomb?

27:04.414 --> 27:05.449
I didn't say that.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.621
Sound the warning system.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.000
Eureka's on lockdown.
No one goes outside
until every Stark is stopped.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.202
Yes, ma'am.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.370
Carter?

27:14.633 --> 27:15.622
That's the answer.
What?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.086
Stark.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.797
I think
we've established that, mate.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.302
No, I mean
why replicate Stark?

27:20.347 --> 27:23.134
I mean, why not Larry
or the IT worker or Lowjack?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.468
They found
the perfect specimen.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.224
You don't go back to dogs
after that.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.300
But he's not perfect.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.136
Have you seen his abs?
Damn close.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.392
My point is, we can't stop
every Stark out there,

27:31.483 --> 27:33.269
but we can stop
the one Stark in here.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.809
Well, every minute
we're looking for him,
they're out there multiplying.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.280
But if we can find
the original...

27:37.322 --> 27:40.155
If we can find Nathan,
then maybe we can figure out
a connection.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.282
Well, where do we start
to look?

27:44.538 --> 27:47.701
I know, I know.
Don't even say.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.075
CARTER: I never ever want
to come down here again.

27:53.255 --> 27:55.120
TAGGART:
Looks like they've all gone.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.835
He's got to be
here somewhere.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.543
At this rate,
it could take us all day.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.470
Hang on,
I'm getting something.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.221
More nanoids?

28:05.309 --> 28:06.640
Different signal.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.477
Dead ahead,
and it's not moving.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.679
Here we go.

28:25.704 --> 28:26.693
Stark!

28:32.085 --> 28:33.700
He's still alive.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.756
The last thing I remember
was Larry attacking me.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.626
And after that,
it's all a dream.

28:38.926 --> 28:41.133
I mean, one minute
I'm kissing Allison,

28:41.220 --> 28:44.087
and the next,
I was a dog.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.473
I think somehow your dreams
are becoming reality,

28:47.559 --> 28:51.598
and I think it has
something to do with that
little glowing mole thingy.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.231
A neural interface system.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.813
It transmits
my thought commands

28:54.900 --> 28:56.515
directly to
the computer network.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.059
Is it possible
that the signals got crossed?

28:59.655 --> 29:01.065
I'm going to kill Fargo.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.949
Get back here!

29:03.825 --> 29:06.612
How was I supposed to know
that my Mental Mouse
and Taggart's nanobugs

29:06.703 --> 29:07.818
shared the same frequency?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.199
Okay, so turn it off.
Problem solved.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.705
CARTER: No! Wait, wait.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.866
What? We need
to sever the connection.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.455
Well, unless
it's our only connection.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.206
I mean, think about it.
Your doubles
are still out there

29:17.256 --> 29:19.588
and they're
no longer responding
to Taggart's remote control,

29:19.675 --> 29:22.337
so that gizmo might be
our only way of reaching them.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.134
Your thoughts,
your subconscious thoughts,
your dreams

29:25.222 --> 29:26.928
must have been transmitted
into their programming.

29:27.015 --> 29:32.100
Okay, so, they're responding
to the last command they got
before the signal went weak?

29:32.896 --> 29:34.227
In theory, yeah.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.690
Okay.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.231
What was the overall theme
of your last dream?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.895
Oh, come on, Stark.
This is no time to be bashful.

29:42.990 --> 29:46.403
Well, there were some
wished fulfillment fantasies
in there.

29:46.785 --> 29:47.774
Like?

29:48.704 --> 29:51.286
Allie and some other stuff.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.787
I need specifics.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.951
The usual. Power, success,
control over everything.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.958
You dream about
world domination?

30:02.801 --> 30:04.007
Not all the time.

30:05.429 --> 30:06.418
(RADIO BEEPING)

30:06.471 --> 30:07.756
Yeah? Go for Carter.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.297
Everyone's off the streets,
except a whole lot
of Nathan Starks.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.806
You may want
to get down here.
Over.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.804
How many?
Too many to count. Over.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.305
All right.
We're working on it.
Hang tight.

30:15.397 --> 30:16.432
Ten-four.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.644
So, assuming that we can
contact these things
through Stark,

30:20.652 --> 30:21.641
what do we do?

30:23.071 --> 30:25.323
Stop them from communicating
with each other.

30:25.365 --> 30:28.983
They'd be reduced
to single cells.
With no threat at all.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.408
So how do we do that?

30:30.579 --> 30:31.819
Interference.

30:31.913 --> 30:34.950
A loud enough, low frequency
blast of sound.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.164
Something below human hearing.
Say, in the two hertz range.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.497
Two hertz?

30:40.547 --> 30:42.708
Generating any volume,
you'd need a massive speaker,

30:42.799 --> 30:44.835
at least eight feet
in diameter.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.422
No.
Bigger's not always better.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.502
Come on.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.923
We're running out of time.
You sit here.
Allison, you ready?

30:53.185 --> 30:55.471
I still don't understand
what we're doing.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.509
Good.

30:56.605 --> 30:57.970
You four, I need you
to go into the booth.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.230
Shut it, lock it,
wait for my signal.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.895
Thanks. Henry.
All right. Come on, guys.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.026
I need you to focus
on bringing them here.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.736
Focus, Nathan.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.201
Command them
with your mind.

31:10.243 --> 31:12.325
Summon them
with your will.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.952
Conjure them with...

31:14.039 --> 31:15.028
Seriously?

31:17.000 --> 31:17.989
Sorry.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.666
CARTER:
Just concentrate.

31:23.632 --> 31:25.497
It's not working.
I can tell it's not working.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.795
He's too focused.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.378
His rational mind
is overruling
his subconscious.

All ego, no id.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.928
Hey.

You are stupid, selfish,

31:39.231 --> 31:40.721
egomaniacal sack of crap,

31:40.816 --> 31:43.649
and I am astonished
that you have gotten
as far as you have.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.236
Coming from you,
that's a compliment.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.358
Okay, slight change of plan.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.397
Well, it’s good to know
the fate of the world
depended on your last one.

31:54.037 --> 31:58.155
Hey, Spencer, could you play
something romantic?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.240
No problem.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.079
We're going to serenade them
into submission now?

32:06.133 --> 32:07.339
Just sit and watch.

I'm sorry, it's habit.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.611
Have I ever told you
how amazing you are?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.408
No.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.498
You're strong, independent,

32:46.798 --> 32:50.461
and smarter than
10 women put together.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.637

as beautiful.

That's really flattering. l...

what you're doing.

I mean every word.

I do for God and country.

absolutely no effect.

No, no, no.
