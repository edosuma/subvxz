01:24.640 --> 01:25.480
Hi, <i>baba.</i>

01:26.200 --> 01:27.720
<i>How is our special guest?</i>

01:27.720 --> 01:30.200
She seems happy. Sunbathing on deck.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.160
<i>Good.</i>

01:31.160 --> 01:33.640
Now you just have to close her.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.200
And put a ring on her finger.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.200
Give me a chance. It's still early days.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.360
<i>Then let me spell out what is at stake.</i>

01:42.360 --> 01:44.440
If you were to marry this girl,

01:44.440 --> 01:48.200
overnight you would become a giant.
A colossus.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.520
You will have money and power
beyond your wildest dreams.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.320
<i>And you would finally be my equal.</i>

01:56.320 --> 01:57.680
Your equal?

01:58.680 --> 01:59.760
Really?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.000
How?

02:02.520 --> 02:05.480
<i>Because I would make you my partner.
In everything.</i>

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
The whole company.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.720
You've never offered that before.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.520
You never deserved it before!

03:14.200 --> 03:17.200
<i>Marrying her would eclipse
everything I have ever achieved.</i>

03:17.200 --> 03:21.480
<i>The Ritz in Paris. Harrods. Everything.</i>

03:21.480 --> 03:25.480
<i>And don't all sons
want to eclipse their fathers?</i>

03:25.480 --> 03:27.840
<i>This is your chance. Don't waste it.</i>

13:13.720 --> 13:15.840
<i>Going home? Already? Why?!</i>

13:15.840 --> 13:17.200
<i>What happened?</i>

13:18.400 --> 13:19.360
She needs to work.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.640
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

13:21.200 --> 13:24.240
Everything is MORE than okay.
I took her shopping.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.560
She picked a ring.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.160
What kind of ring?

13:30.520 --> 13:31.400
A gold star.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.200
Covered in diamonds.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.760
From a collection called Dis-Moi Oui.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.440
<i>Oh my God!</i>

13:39.440 --> 13:42.760
He shoots, he scores!!

13:43.520 --> 13:45.480
- <i>It's an engagement ring!</i>
- I don't know.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.440
Of course it's an engagement ring!
Dis-Moi Oui, it means, "Say yes to me."

13:51.640 --> 13:54.200
My son!! You're a closer!!

13:54.200 --> 13:55.520
You're a Fayed!!

13:55.520 --> 13:57.920
Is she wearing it now?

13:57.920 --> 13:59.200
I need a picture.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
I haven't got it yet.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.000
I rang the store after we left.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.080
They have it in their Paris branch.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.320
<i>Then take her to Paris.</i>

14:11.200 --> 14:13.840
I would, but she wants to go home.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.560
<i>No.</i>

14:16.200 --> 14:20.040
Take her to Paris
and put the ring on her finger.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.960
This is the greatest day of my life!!

14:22.960 --> 14:25.040
I knew you would do it.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.640
<i>My son!!</i>

14:27.600 --> 14:28.920
<i>My Fayed son!!</i>

14:29.440 --> 14:31.200
<i>Bye.</i>

14:32.200 --> 14:33.200
Bye.

17:23.080 --> 17:24.720
Straight to my apartment.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.600
I have strict orders from Mr. Mohamed.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.560
First to Villa Windsor
and then to the apartment.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.880
The Princess has a set time
for a phone call with her sons.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.320
Straight to my apartment.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.680
Mr. Mohamed's specific instruction
was to take you to Villa Windsor.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.200
Hi, <i>baba.</i>

18:45.360 --> 18:47.000
This wasn't a good idea.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.480
<i>Relax. Give her to me.</i>

18:50.200 --> 18:53.400
It's not the right time. Trust me.
The deviation has irritated her.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.720
Give her to me!

19:58.600 --> 20:00.760
Please stop interfering.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.000
It was all going fine.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.600
I'm just trying to help.

20:04.600 --> 20:07.160
Well, you're not helping.
She's stressed now.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.720
<i>Then go and calm her down.</i>

20:13.040 --> 20:15.480
Please, just leave this with me.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.360
I know how important this is to you.
But I know what I'm doing.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.560
Okay, smarty-pants. Bye.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.760
Bye.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.320
Can't we lose them?

20:54.320 --> 20:55.680
Come on. Speed up.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.880
- This is such a mess.
- I know, but I can't do anything about it.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.680
Yes, but you have to try something!

28:15.840 --> 28:17.440
Roses on the table.

28:17.440 --> 28:20.240
- Roses. Understood.
- Lots of roses. This is very important.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.000
Consider it done.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.040
Would you like to see the ring?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.760
- There.
- Ah yes. It is beautiful.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.640
Not bad.

32:04.880 --> 32:05.760
Come on. Let's go.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Make a right.

32:22.320 --> 32:24.520
- Go, go, go! Turn right!
- You can't turn here, sir.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.800
Philippe, change of plan.

32:35.800 --> 32:36.960
Take us to the Ritz.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.000
So,

43:22.600 --> 43:24.240
have you done it?

43:24.240 --> 43:25.720
<i>Have you asked her?</i>

43:26.480 --> 43:28.560
<i>Have you made my dreams come true?</i>

43:46.240 --> 43:47.200
<i>You do?</i>

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
<i>Tell me.</i>

44:07.760 --> 44:09.000
Are you there?

48:10.480 --> 48:12.280
Are you smoking that or...?

48:13.080 --> 48:14.440
No, I'm looking after it.

48:14.440 --> 48:15.400
Okay.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.080
- Cigars are in fashion.
- Do you want it?

48:18.080 --> 48:19.880
No, I quit.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.720
- You'd enjoy it though.
- Yes.

48:22.840 --> 48:24.280
Next week maybe.

48:26.880 --> 48:28.440
Henri, plans have changed.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.200
Mr. Dodi needs you to drive.

48:31.000 --> 48:31.840
Right away.

48:41.400 --> 48:42.440
Put it on my tab.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.080
In ten minutes.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.280
They'll be out in ten minutes.

50:31.680 --> 50:33.840
- Everything okay, Henri?
- Yes.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.600
Are Philippe and Jean-FranÃ§ois
out doing what I asked?

50:37.600 --> 50:39.760
Yes, they're out front
doing the diversion.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.760
No one will see us leave.

50:43.760 --> 50:44.840
Trust me.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.240
Good.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.760
Don't try following us.
You'll never catch us.

51:54.760 --> 51:56.760
Piss off.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.440
- Ready. Let's go.
- Yes. Okay.

52:29.600 --> 52:31.760
Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here.
