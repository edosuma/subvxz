WEBVTT

00:00.109 --> 00:02.007
No. No way.

00:02.203 --> 00:04.203
You're the first cop on the scene, dude.

00:04.969 --> 00:06.177
Doesn't matter.

00:06.183 --> 00:08.305
Backup to the police
are 20 minutes away.

00:08.311 --> 00:10.687
- She's still warm.
- Yeah, I still wouldn't do it.

00:10.693 --> 00:12.986
- It's Marilyn Monroe!
- I'd sneak a peek,

00:12.992 --> 00:15.152
but I wouldn't do that.
I do have some morals.

00:15.158 --> 00:16.451
You won't get caught.

00:16.457 --> 00:18.649
Her body would be riddled with evidence.

00:19.143 --> 00:22.061
You know, prints, hair,

00:22.746 --> 00:24.625
- my semen.
- So?

00:24.631 --> 00:28.238
Dude, it's the Sixties. DNA
hasn't even been discovered yet.

00:28.244 --> 00:29.444
No one will ever know.

00:29.450 --> 00:30.920
They'd keep it on file.

00:30.926 --> 00:33.733
They'd cut to a 70-year-old
me explaining to my grand-kids

00:33.739 --> 00:37.211
that I went to prison for having
sex with Marilyn Monroe's corpse.

00:37.616 --> 00:40.482
Dude, this'll have to be my last
one. I gotta get ready for work.

00:41.179 --> 00:43.603
Just take the day off. I did.

00:43.780 --> 00:45.095
What, again?

00:45.217 --> 00:46.417
Yep.

00:46.423 --> 00:48.803
All I gotta do is put up
some missing cat posters.

00:48.809 --> 00:51.905
So, Becca still doesn't
know you killed her cat?

00:52.389 --> 00:54.729
Nope. And she never will.

00:55.363 --> 00:59.097
_

00:59.183 --> 01:01.319
I still bear the scars.

01:02.612 --> 01:05.260
_

01:05.266 --> 01:07.658
And I am their Queen.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.070
Oh!

01:14.057 --> 01:16.260
- Shit.
- What's wrong?

01:18.628 --> 01:22.039
Oh, shit! Shit! Becca's back.

01:27.019 --> 01:28.322
Shit!

Oh!

01:45.258 --> 01:46.512
Hi, honey.

01:48.584 --> 01:50.711
- Why can I smell smoke?
- Can you?

01:51.274 --> 01:53.477
Oh, um, I know, huh...

01:53.664 --> 01:57.181
there were some, uh,
teenagers smoking some weed.

01:57.455 --> 01:59.798
- Must have wafted in.
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:59.804 --> 02:01.386
Don't smoke in the flat.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.999
- I told you, I've given up.
- What are you doing here anyway?

02:04.606 --> 02:07.726
Oh, I... I had my
scan today. For my arm.

02:07.811 --> 02:09.080
Oh yeah, how was it?

02:09.170 --> 02:10.978
Oh, it's always the same.

02:10.984 --> 02:12.558
They don't... they don't
know what wrong with it.

02:12.564 --> 02:14.890
They just said, you
know, just keep it rested.

02:14.896 --> 02:18.768
Just keep... doing... what you're doing.

02:18.969 --> 02:20.766
Hasn't stopped you
playing PlayStation then?

02:20.864 --> 02:22.064
No.

02:22.070 --> 02:25.433
No, well they... actually they said
it was good exercise, for my thumb.

02:25.943 --> 02:28.036
So, what are you doing here
anyway? Shouldn't you...

02:28.240 --> 02:31.545
- shouldn't you be at work?
- Oh, this isn't yours, you make it stink.

02:33.005 --> 02:34.820
- Me lamp!
- Yes.

02:34.826 --> 02:36.809
Your... your lamp. Um...

02:37.009 --> 02:38.619
You're not gonna believe this,

02:39.521 --> 02:41.468
but it was... Peanut.

02:41.701 --> 02:43.529
- Peanut's back?
- Yeah.

02:43.535 --> 02:45.183
And... no.

02:45.329 --> 02:48.746
Oh, it's the weirdest thing, he
just... jumped into the window.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.935
- Oh, my God!
- Like he was possessed.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.625
You know, running around,
knocking things over,

02:53.631 --> 02:55.337
including your lamp,

02:55.343 --> 02:57.515
- and uh...
- Why do you always lie to me?

02:57.639 --> 02:58.839
I don't.

02:58.905 --> 03:01.308
Just tell the truth
for once in your life.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.221
I am telling the truth.

03:03.227 --> 03:04.647
I can't do this anymore.

03:05.132 --> 03:06.332
We're finished.

03:06.338 --> 03:09.835
We're finished? What... what...
what... You're dumping me? But...

03:10.030 --> 03:12.290
but we're only halfway through
season 5 of Game of Thrones?

03:12.296 --> 03:14.286
Oh, great! So that's your only
argument for us to stay together?

03:14.292 --> 03:16.825
- 'Cause I don't even like Game of Thrones.
- What?

03:16.831 --> 03:18.720
You cried when they killed Ned.

03:18.726 --> 03:21.132
Get out! Get out! Get your
things together and leave.

03:21.138 --> 03:23.092
- But this is my home.
- No, it's my home.

03:23.098 --> 03:24.624
You don't even pay rent.

03:24.630 --> 03:27.530
I pay our Netflix subscription.

03:27.536 --> 03:29.725
I'm gonna stay with my mum and dad,

03:29.731 --> 03:32.890
and I'm gonna give you till the end
of the week to get your things out.

03:32.896 --> 03:34.096

Hurry up.

03:58.852 --> 04:00.383
I'm coming, my sweetie.

04:01.258 --> 04:03.274
Wear your glasses.

04:03.280 --> 04:06.470
My... my glasses make me
look old, light of my life.

04:06.476 --> 04:07.676
You are old.

04:08.090 --> 04:09.897
Even Botox wouldn't help.

04:10.325 --> 04:11.915
I'll just wear my glasses.

04:13.891 --> 04:15.091
Oh, right.

04:15.299 --> 04:16.499
Hello.

04:21.213 --> 04:22.842
How do I get her back, Ash?

04:23.332 --> 04:26.379
Don't know. Maybe you need
to give her some space.

04:27.031 --> 04:29.968
What if... what if I took her
to a really expensive restaurant?

04:30.137 --> 04:34.218
You know, pay for
everything, nice wine, steak.

04:34.224 --> 04:36.683
Steak? Isn't she vegetarian?

04:37.866 --> 04:41.421
Do you know what? She might be. Shit!

04:45.206 --> 04:46.682
So...

04:47.249 --> 04:48.600
what are you gonna do?

04:48.960 --> 04:50.343
Can I stay at yours?

04:50.349 --> 04:53.557
Oh, man, that might be tricky.
The baby still sleeps with Vanessa.

04:54.064 --> 04:55.788
I've just broken my arm.

04:56.435 --> 04:58.045
How do I get over this?

05:01.947 --> 05:03.469
These things never work.

05:03.631 --> 05:06.351
Can't it just be a... key in a lock?

05:06.461 --> 05:07.741
The old days.

05:08.226 --> 05:11.147
Those are my keys and that's
a USB stick you're pressing.

05:22.995 --> 05:26.758
- Hello?
- Hi, am I speaking to Daniel Glass?

05:26.764 --> 05:28.029
Uh, yeah, that's me.

05:28.035 --> 05:30.156
Just a remind that you
have an appointment here

05:30.162 --> 05:32.664

05:32.670 --> 05:34.143
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.

05:34.149 --> 05:37.107
Just to let you know you
won't be seeing Dr Leek today

05:37.113 --> 05:38.547
as he is on leave.

05:38.553 --> 05:42.213
All of his cases are being
overseen by Dr Glennis.

05:42.219 --> 05:43.419
Dr Glennis?

05:43.425 --> 05:47.525
He's one of our best doctors.
You'll be in safe hands.

05:51.908 --> 05:54.834
The NHS is on its death bed.

05:54.993 --> 05:58.236
Long waiting times, outdated equipment,

05:58.242 --> 06:01.420
and wards riddled with MRSA...

06:01.595 --> 06:06.608

give our customers the peace of mind

Hey! Hey?

06:36.662 --> 06:39.393
Did, uh, did Michael
notice I wasn't here?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.040
I don't think so. Is
it your first day here?

06:43.431 --> 06:47.448
What? No, no, I've worked
here for like two years.

06:49.437 --> 06:50.953
No way.

06:53.044 --> 06:55.353
Hi, this is Daniel
at We Cover Insurance.

06:55.359 --> 06:56.705
How can I help you today?

06:56.711 --> 07:01.107
I want to cancel my cancel my
husband's plan. Account number 31A28D.

07:01.113 --> 07:02.427
Uh, yeah, why?

07:02.433 --> 07:05.178
- H... he passed away.
- Oh.

07:05.388 --> 07:09.066
Oh right, um, it says he's got
another four payments to make,

07:09.072 --> 07:12.486
- I just, I...
- um, and plus, if you cancel now, you will,

07:12.492 --> 07:16.576
er, invalidate your ã35 M&S voucher.

07:18.346 --> 07:19.558
Hello?

07:22.313 --> 07:23.610
Ah, hi, Mom.

07:23.616 --> 07:26.307
- Hi, Simon.
- No. It's not Simon, it's

07:26.313 --> 07:29.585
- Daniel, your other son.
- Oh, sorry, Daniel.

07:29.591 --> 07:32.288
- Everything okay?
- Uh, not really.

07:32.294 --> 07:34.393
Becca kicked me out.

07:34.399 --> 07:36.085
Oh dear...

07:36.886 --> 07:38.421
Who... who's Becca?

07:38.427 --> 07:40.357
But... She... My girlfriend...

07:40.363 --> 07:42.771
who I've been living with for two years.

07:42.777 --> 07:45.442
Oh, Becca. What a shame.

07:45.566 --> 07:48.061
- Do you think I could come and stay?
- Oh!

07:48.067 --> 07:50.074
Your brother's calling. Gotta go.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.379
Hi, Simon.

07:51.385 --> 07:55.340
You had one job to do, get me a
make-up artist and you ass fucked it!

07:55.346 --> 07:56.734
You didn't mention it yesterday.

07:56.740 --> 07:59.201
Isn't it obvious that I need make-up?

07:59.207 --> 08:01.828
I'm going on television to
promote this fucking company.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.510
- Yeah, sorry, Kenny.
- I'm working harder than a hooker's pussy

08:04.516 --> 08:07.742
to grow We Cover and
can you explain to me

08:07.748 --> 08:10.968
why we only get a one-percent
increase in the last quarter.

08:10.974 --> 08:13.688
- Can you explain that to me?
- Well, an increase is an increase.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.477
I want you to fire some of these pricks.

08:16.483 --> 08:20.493
Maybe it'll shove a red hot dildo
up the rest of their lazy asses.

08:20.499 --> 08:23.001
I... I thought this was the
best area for the interview.

08:23.007 --> 08:25.500
With this bunch of gargoyles behind me?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.717
Wouldn't jizz on them
if they were on fire.

08:27.723 --> 08:31.292
Hi, this is Daniel at We Cover
Insurance. How can I help you today?

08:31.298 --> 08:36.058
Jesus-H-fucking-Christ, there's
not a single face in this place

08:36.065 --> 08:37.756
that's fit for TV.

08:37.763 --> 08:40.384
Except... maybe her.

08:40.390 --> 08:44.812
Move her to this desk here.
Get rid of this asshole.

08:44.818 --> 08:46.704
We'll just keep the camera tight.

08:46.710 --> 08:49.660
So we don't get any of these
other shit lickers in the shot.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.543
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay? Yeah, good. I'm gonna crap.

08:52.826 --> 08:54.263
Ah, hi, Mike.

08:54.269 --> 08:56.911
He's the shit licker, right?

08:56.917 --> 08:58.519
Are you not on the phone to a customer?

08:59.435 --> 09:02.533
Oh, they... they've had
some shopping delivered.

09:02.539 --> 09:06.054
Okay, well when you're done, can
you come in for a quick word please?

09:08.044 --> 09:09.428
It's your numbers.

09:09.742 --> 09:11.262
They're way up.

09:11.268 --> 09:12.752
Oh, great.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.662
Oh, no, no, it's not great.

09:14.706 --> 09:17.283
You've got a very
high cancellation rate.

09:17.289 --> 09:19.722
I mean, our customers are
slipping through your fingers.

09:19.728 --> 09:22.738
You try keeping up an angry
customer when all you can offer is a

09:22.744 --> 09:24.925
ã35 M&S voucher.

09:24.931 --> 09:28.543
That, I think, is a pretty good deal.

09:28.549 --> 09:31.955
I mean, do you even like working here?

09:32.316 --> 09:34.636
- I... love it.
- Now...

09:34.642 --> 09:37.629
I'm... I'm s... I'm sorry,
Daniel, to have to do this but I...

09:37.635 --> 09:42.220
No, no, no, I... I'm really sorry.
I've... I've got my appointment.

09:42.226 --> 09:44.804
Yeah... yeah, of course.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.336
- Another test?
- Scan results today.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.472
Uh, fingers crossed they finally

09:49.478 --> 09:52.237
- work out what's wrong with it.
- Let's hope so.

09:54.035 --> 09:55.592
Wasn't it your left arm?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.160
Yes.

09:59.221 --> 10:00.421
Yeah, it was.

10:01.205 --> 10:02.698
But now it's the right.

10:02.704 --> 10:06.115
I've been, uh, overcompensating.

10:10.771 --> 10:12.898
Uh. Very unusual.

10:12.966 --> 10:14.596
Tell me, uh, Daniel,

10:14.763 --> 10:16.981
are you, uh... are you a smoker?

10:17.068 --> 10:20.486
Uh, no. No. Ah, why?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.026
Something has come up.

10:22.543 --> 10:23.792
Look...

10:24.165 --> 10:25.470
I'll level with you.

10:26.180 --> 10:29.498
There's nothing really
wrong with my arm.

10:29.859 --> 10:32.672
I was just trying to
get some time off work.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.236
Well, you may be getting, uh,

10:35.242 --> 10:37.649
a bit more time off
than you bargained for.

10:41.705 --> 10:45.491
That was in... in bad taste
actually. I'm... uh, I'm sorry.

10:45.595 --> 10:47.101
Sorry for what?

10:47.892 --> 10:52.611
I'm afraid I have to tell you,
Daniel, that you have cancer.

11:09.604 --> 11:11.225
I have cancer?

11:12.283 --> 11:16.291
Yes. Yes, there was a
shadow on one of your scans

11:16.297 --> 11:21.087
and the... the biopsy we did
has, it has confirmed that.

11:23.587 --> 11:25.306
I... I have...

11:25.572 --> 11:27.096
elbow cancer?

11:29.727 --> 11:32.556
No. No, no. Your...
your... your elbow is fine.

11:32.562 --> 11:35.740
There's... there's no such
thing as... as elbow cancer.

11:35.746 --> 11:39.634
Um... you... you have cancer
of the osni... of the oth...

11:39.640 --> 11:40.935
uh, it's here.

11:40.941 --> 11:44.281
You have cancer of the osni... Very
difficult to pronounce this one.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.547
Yeah. Your asnophagus.

11:48.339 --> 11:50.961
My... my oesophagus?

11:50.967 --> 11:52.885
That's right. Your osnophagus.

11:53.341 --> 11:55.388
Look, uh... I'm gonna level with you.

11:55.394 --> 11:57.503
Uh, it really couldn't
be in a worse place

11:57.509 --> 12:00.519
but, uh, I am a very
experienced oncologist,

12:00.525 --> 12:02.808
um, I've successfully
treated many patients.

12:02.814 --> 12:05.722
- You're a young man, you're fit, you're healthy.
- I'm not.

12:07.466 --> 12:09.572
I don't do any exercise.

12:10.568 --> 12:13.804
And I... I do smoke. Smoke all the time.

12:15.076 --> 12:16.725
My diet's shit.

12:17.943 --> 12:20.489
I've probably eat about
fifty units already this week.

12:20.495 --> 12:22.773
Yes... that... that explains a lot.

12:24.789 --> 12:27.474
Look... it's not all bad news. I've...

12:27.552 --> 12:31.312
as part of a special relationship
we have here at the clinic,

12:31.398 --> 12:34.971
we treat every We Cover
employee... for free.

12:34.977 --> 12:36.250
Just don't get fired.

12:37.046 --> 12:38.252
That's what I say.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.245
Ag-again, I'm... I'm sorry.

12:40.569 --> 12:43.645
Must assure you my doctoring skills

12:43.651 --> 12:46.156
are... are better than my
lightening the mood skills.

12:48.597 --> 12:49.797
Huh!

12:50.017 --> 12:51.910
- Good Lord.
- What?

12:51.916 --> 12:53.116
I was wrong.

12:54.119 --> 12:56.918
It says here you can
get cancer of the elbow.

13:13.171 --> 13:16.942
So, tell me, have you ever
been on television before?

13:16.948 --> 13:19.056
Yes, once.

13:19.239 --> 13:22.653
- Well, I was on a train plat...
- I've done a million of these.

13:22.659 --> 13:25.632
I dunno what it feels
like to be nervous anymore.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.526
- Well, what about stress?
- You know what's good for stress?

13:28.923 --> 13:30.123
Fucking.

13:31.527 --> 13:32.753
Well, yes...

13:32.759 --> 13:34.617
but I've got something better.

13:34.718 --> 13:37.985
I've been working on an invention
that I'd like to run past you.

13:37.991 --> 13:39.554
The stress thumb.

13:40.288 --> 13:41.488
So...

13:41.894 --> 13:44.210
What, you put that up your asshole?

13:45.774 --> 13:47.210
No, silly...

13:47.480 --> 13:49.105
You put it in your mouth.

13:50.634 --> 13:51.834
You know,

13:51.840 --> 13:56.546
I have a reservation at a rather
exclusive restaurant for lunch.

13:56.941 --> 13:59.425
Maybe you'd like to tell
me all about it then.

14:15.123 --> 14:16.404
You see...

14:16.410 --> 14:19.401
We Cover works with a
number of top clinics,

14:19.407 --> 14:22.400
that we immediately refer our people to.

14:22.406 --> 14:24.804
We wanna offer the people the...

14:24.810 --> 14:29.159
the level of care that we
believe, everyone deserves.

14:29.532 --> 14:32.540
Caring for the sick is what We Cover,

14:32.546 --> 14:33.859
is all about.

14:37.395 --> 14:39.967
You fucking asshole!

14:40.170 --> 14:41.764
- Okay, um, can we...
- Watch the...

14:41.770 --> 14:43.896
can we stop that... that
film, can we... can we just...

14:43.902 --> 14:45.432
- What the?
- Okay, do...

14:45.438 --> 14:46.892
- Gimme the tape.
- Are you okay?

14:46.898 --> 14:50.268
I've spoken to BBC news, and they
promised not to run the footage.

14:50.274 --> 14:52.221
- Thank God it wasn't live.
- Michael...

14:52.227 --> 14:54.521
fire this cumstain.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.727
Leave this to me.

14:55.733 --> 14:58.310
Uh, Daniel, I... I...
w... y-y-you know the

14:58.316 --> 15:00.616
issues that we discussed earlier...

15:00.622 --> 15:03.026
Fucking fire him!

15:03.032 --> 15:05.198
- I'm afraid...
- I've got cancer.

15:08.595 --> 15:10.001
What?

15:10.519 --> 15:13.231
I've been diagnosed
with oesophageal cancer.

15:15.109 --> 15:18.241
So? Boo-hoo.

15:18.296 --> 15:21.035
- Clear your desk!
- Well obviously he's in shock.

15:21.041 --> 15:24.007
- That's why he was sick.
- But so fucking what?

15:24.093 --> 15:26.423
One in three people get cancer.

15:26.429 --> 15:29.025
That means that one of us
was always gonna get it.

15:29.031 --> 15:30.916
I'm just glad it was him.

15:30.922 --> 15:33.210
Oh, now Kenny, there is protocol, um...

15:33.216 --> 15:35.212
Daniel, maybe you should head home.

15:36.288 --> 15:37.488
Yeah.

15:38.191 --> 15:39.502
Thanks.

15:44.613 --> 15:47.129
I'm sor... I'm sorry, Mr West.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.772
Take the cleaning bill out of his pay.

16:01.338 --> 16:02.654
Oh...

16:02.735 --> 16:05.847
hi, Daniel. Look, I know
Becca's chucked you out,

16:05.853 --> 16:08.146
but, honestly, we jus...

16:13.394 --> 16:15.596
Ash, you all right?

16:17.888 --> 16:19.894
You'd loose your voice.

16:20.555 --> 16:23.469
Your last words are just
gonna be gargles and noises.

16:23.475 --> 16:26.391
- It's not gonna be like that.
- My uncle had it...

16:26.930 --> 16:28.657
It was horrible.

16:29.751 --> 16:31.891
He just wasted away.

16:32.847 --> 16:35.063
I didn't even recognise him at the end.

16:35.542 --> 16:37.658
He just stank of death.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.651
And now, you will too.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.156
I dunno if I can go through this again.

16:42.162 --> 16:44.756
Oh, honey. Come here.

16:45.146 --> 16:46.859
It's gonna be okay.

16:47.154 --> 16:48.967
He is gonna get through this,

16:48.973 --> 16:51.086
and we are gonna help him.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.265
I.. I love you.

16:53.271 --> 16:54.642
You too.

16:55.845 --> 16:57.821
Now, I really need to
get some sleep, because...

16:57.827 --> 16:59.626
Benny's gonna be up in a few hours.

16:59.829 --> 17:02.252
Everything will look
better in the morning.

17:13.356 --> 17:14.781
All right, come on.

17:15.871 --> 17:17.070
Yeah.

17:22.655 --> 17:24.351
Well, I wanted to...

17:25.046 --> 17:29.265
apologise, on behalf
of Mr West and myself,

17:29.436 --> 17:33.031
for any distress that
was caused yesterday.

17:34.176 --> 17:37.176
I... I'm sorry for
throwing up on Mr West.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.888
Uh, it couldn't be helped.

17:39.778 --> 17:42.696
I don't... I guess there
was a funny side to it.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.158
- Did he... did he think it was funny?
- No.

17:47.335 --> 17:50.356
Anyway, um, your job here is safe.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.970
- That's amazing. Thank you, Michael.
- No, thank you, Daniel.

17:54.546 --> 17:57.165
Thank you for all your hard wor...

17:57.241 --> 17:58.734
for your bravery.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.120
I...

18:01.616 --> 18:02.898
I'll just... yeah.

18:03.701 --> 18:04.901
Huh.

18:29.473 --> 18:31.182
You know I didn't want
it to end like this.

18:31.188 --> 18:33.297
It was... my fault.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.776
I was a terrible boyfriend.

18:38.064 --> 18:39.979
I took you for granted.

18:41.127 --> 18:42.717
Spent all your money.

18:43.716 --> 18:45.419
Didn't give you anything back.

18:47.211 --> 18:48.841
We had something great..

18:50.194 --> 18:51.788
and I blew it.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.124
Have you found somewhere to stay?

18:56.130 --> 18:58.617
Yeah... yeah, no, I'm staying with Ash,

18:58.623 --> 19:00.718
- for a bit...
- Oh.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.868
Oh, right... I... I...
I thought you were...

19:04.352 --> 19:06.257
gonna try and find a place on your own.

19:06.263 --> 19:08.379
Oh, well, I'll be fine.

19:10.548 --> 19:12.154
So your arm's better then.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.645
Yeah, yeah, my arm...

19:15.651 --> 19:18.352
my arm's fine. Everything's fine.

19:19.329 --> 19:22.556
Yeah, okay, I know when you're
lying to me Daniel, what's going on?

19:22.774 --> 19:25.789
Uh, I wasn't gonna say anything...

19:27.500 --> 19:28.885
but...

19:29.891 --> 19:32.281
You were gonna go without telling me.

19:32.817 --> 19:34.943
You can't do this on your own.

19:36.115 --> 19:37.528
Wait a minute...

19:37.810 --> 19:39.300
Are you bullshitting me?

19:39.411 --> 19:42.770
Look, I know I've told a few
white lies in my time, but...

19:42.939 --> 19:45.946
come on, people... people
don't lie about cancer.

19:51.251 --> 19:53.157
I want to be there for you.

20:23.591 --> 20:25.678
Fuck, I was*, but it hasn't
been like that for ages.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.513
Oh... yeah!

20:28.287 --> 20:30.701
- Where did we go wrong, Becca?
- We?

20:30.841 --> 20:32.041
Really?

20:32.863 --> 20:35.566
No, I just... I just couldn't trust you.

20:35.746 --> 20:37.356
You lied to me all the time.

20:38.652 --> 20:41.969
Look... full disclosure.

20:43.927 --> 20:45.957
I've got something else to tell you.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.152
Peanut's dead.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.683
What?

20:52.144 --> 20:53.344
Mmm.

20:53.829 --> 20:55.285
Oh, no.

20:56.329 --> 20:57.988
Oh, God no. I didn't...

20:58.134 --> 20:59.967
Well, did someone cause it?

21:00.011 --> 21:01.395
Was it a car?

21:01.610 --> 21:03.909
No... um...

21:04.551 --> 21:06.455
I killed him.

21:07.739 --> 21:09.653
It was an accident, you know. I...

21:09.659 --> 21:13.559
I was walking out the door, I didn't
realise he was behind me, and I...

21:14.129 --> 21:17.631
slammed the door on his neck.
Yeah, but it was instant...

21:18.954 --> 21:22.286
No. No more lies.

21:23.056 --> 21:25.844
It wasn't instant, it
was... I had to slam the door

21:25.850 --> 21:28.634
three or four more times
to stop the screaming.

21:32.012 --> 21:33.780
Poor Peanut.

21:34.161 --> 21:36.438
Look, I'm gonna finish
packing my things.

21:36.444 --> 21:38.287
No... no! No way.

21:38.561 --> 21:40.473
I don't want you to move out.

21:41.094 --> 21:44.519
You know, like you
said, it was an accident.

21:46.297 --> 21:47.821
You need me right now,

21:47.827 --> 21:50.329
and I wanna be there for
you, every step of the way.

21:51.113 --> 21:52.464
I love you.

21:55.526 --> 21:57.172
I love you too.

22:01.182 --> 22:03.861
_

22:04.800 --> 22:07.396
Hey... are you feeling better?

22:07.573 --> 22:08.870
Oh, yeah.

22:08.876 --> 22:11.787
Was it something you ate, or stress?

22:12.182 --> 22:17.189
Uh, probably stress, I... I had
just been... diagnosed with cancer.

22:19.374 --> 22:20.993
Yeah, right.

22:21.549 --> 22:25.733
Well... say hello to: 'Stressthumb'.

22:25.739 --> 22:28.444
You place it over your
actual thumb, suck,

22:28.450 --> 22:30.711
and it releases essential
vitamins and minerals,

22:30.717 --> 22:32.746
that will melt your stress away.

22:33.022 --> 22:34.726
It's strawberry flavoured.

22:34.827 --> 22:36.452
Oh, what a...

22:36.837 --> 22:40.139
- great idea.
- I know, no one's ever made these before.

22:48.861 --> 22:52.021
_

22:55.887 --> 22:57.809
So you're saying 'six months'?

22:58.336 --> 22:59.536
Yes.

22:59.605 --> 23:04.629
So... so... so, Daniel
might be dead in six months.

23:04.635 --> 23:07.829
Yes, yes. Less even.

23:08.066 --> 23:09.266
Oh, my God.

23:13.629 --> 23:14.955
- What?
- _

23:15.558 --> 23:18.439
07700-900843.

23:18.445 --> 23:21.206
You've taken my phone,
you fucking idiot.

23:21.915 --> 23:23.544
Really? Uh, hang on...

23:24.524 --> 23:27.815
Oh, sorry I have to...

23:28.011 --> 23:31.021
speak to another patient about
a rather important matter.

23:31.318 --> 23:32.620
Um...

23:34.994 --> 23:36.417
Ugh!

23:38.875 --> 23:40.460
Ah, ha-ha-ha.

23:40.554 --> 23:42.205
I always forget it opens inward.

23:43.849 --> 23:45.708
You should get a second opinion.

23:49.364 --> 23:52.075
- I can take as many days off as I like,
- Uh-huh.

23:52.081 --> 23:55.576
people at work, who used to
ignore me, now bring me coffee,

23:55.582 --> 23:57.375
and everyone's just being so nice to me.

23:57.381 --> 23:59.775
Huh, what, even... even your folks?

23:59.781 --> 24:02.052
Oh yeah... I... I haven't
actually told them yet.

24:02.943 --> 24:05.971
You haven't, hmm? So...

24:05.977 --> 24:09.677
- You and Becca?
- Yeah, yeah, thing's are good.

24:09.755 --> 24:12.811
You know I've realised I was taking
her for granted all this time so...

24:13.409 --> 24:16.292
- Not anymore.
- Well, proud of you dude.

24:16.784 --> 24:19.784
Hey, if you ever need
anything from me, just holler.

24:19.790 --> 24:22.612
Yeah, right now I need
you to stop pissing about,

24:22.618 --> 24:24.764
and lay down some suppressing fire.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.342
- Gonna storm that bunker.
- Ha-ha-ha, okay...

24:27.348 --> 24:29.227
Locking and loading.

24:29.342 --> 24:32.350
Stealing and self-administering
medication is dangerous...

24:32.356 --> 24:33.642
and illegal.

24:33.648 --> 24:35.663
Can I ask wha...

24:36.555 --> 24:40.383
- this is in connection with?
- The missing Botox.

24:40.750 --> 24:42.969
I've no id... I've no idea
what you're talking about.

24:42.975 --> 24:45.540
Ian, how do you explain your face?

24:45.749 --> 24:49.561
We, uh, we... we had a
crab supper last night,

24:49.567 --> 24:52.077
and I... I think...
I think I'm having...

24:52.256 --> 24:54.069
- an allergic reaction to it.
-

24:54.075 --> 24:56.170
Look at you, you're a mess.

24:56.176 --> 24:57.719
The last time you covered for Dr Leek

24:57.725 --> 24:59.609
you prescribed Tetracycline
to a pregnant woman.

24:59.615 --> 25:01.829
It could've killed her, not
to mention her unborn child.

25:01.835 --> 25:03.617
Thank God the pharmacist spotted it.

25:03.623 --> 25:05.537
No, I didn't know she was pregnant.

25:05.617 --> 25:07.735
She was in her third trimester!

25:09.374 --> 25:10.706
This is it, Iain,

25:12.159 --> 25:15.182
one more slip-up, and you're finished.

25:24.984 --> 25:27.530
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

25:28.158 --> 25:31.244
Okay, can I take some
details, from you first, um...

25:31.652 --> 25:33.147
Hey, champ...

25:33.644 --> 25:36.543
um, you've got a visitor
to see you, in my office.

25:36.933 --> 25:39.559
Can I just put you on
hold, for one second?

25:40.693 --> 25:44.683
- Who is it?
- Ah, your doctor. Glennis, is it?

25:50.906 --> 25:52.113
What is it?

25:52.119 --> 25:54.209
- It.. it's spread, hasn't it?
- No.

25:54.215 --> 25:57.131
It's... it's... it's not, it's
not bad news. In fact it's...

25:57.137 --> 25:59.139
it's actually the opposite of bad news.

26:00.164 --> 26:01.651
G-g-go on.

26:02.246 --> 26:05.874
I'm very pleased to
say, Daniel, that you....

26:06.257 --> 26:08.258
you don't have cancer.

26:11.534 --> 26:14.731
I... I don't have cancer?

26:14.817 --> 26:16.427
No.

26:17.505 --> 26:21.309
- So... I'm... I'm not... I'm not ill?
- No!

26:23.334 --> 26:24.967
Oh, my God.

26:25.032 --> 26:28.252
Thank you, thank you,
God, I-I don't have cancer?

26:28.258 --> 26:30.759
No, you're, you're
as fit as a fisherman.

26:30.765 --> 26:32.176
Oh, my God. Um...

26:32.182 --> 26:33.603
If you just sign that
for me, it's just...

26:33.609 --> 26:34.871
it's a formality. I wouldn't...

26:34.877 --> 26:39.066
Oh, Th-thank you so much Dr
Glennis. I can't believe it.

26:39.072 --> 26:41.041
Ha-ha-ha, it's amazing.

26:41.263 --> 26:42.466
What, uh, what's this?

26:42.472 --> 26:44.069
It's just a formality, you don't...

26:44.075 --> 26:45.679
Uh, "I hereby agree,

26:45.685 --> 26:47.520
- "not to tell anyone
- ...don't have to read it all.

26:47.526 --> 26:50.309
"that I was misdiagnosed with
cancer." I'm not signing this!

26:50.315 --> 26:53.018
- I really, really need you to sign it.
- No, no way.

26:53.024 --> 26:56.948
You told me I had cancer. Do you
know what I've been through? Jesus!

26:57.317 --> 26:58.620
Please!

26:58.626 --> 27:00.922
If this get's out, I'm finished.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.134
My wife will leave me.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.830
She's only sticking around for
the money, what's left of it.

27:05.836 --> 27:07.234
She can't even bare to touch me.

27:07.240 --> 27:09.833
That... that's not really my problem.

27:10.726 --> 27:15.704
Fine.... then you will be in breach
of doctor-patient confidentiality.

27:15.710 --> 27:17.703
That only works one way!

27:18.009 --> 27:19.209
D-does it?

27:19.705 --> 27:21.119
Oh, all right.

27:22.297 --> 27:23.806
I'll... I'll pay you.

27:24.845 --> 27:26.045
- How much?
-

27:27.048 --> 27:28.481
Fifty pounds.

27:28.487 --> 27:29.962
- God!
- No, sixty!

27:30.126 --> 27:34.345
Tell your boss, he'll be hearing
from my lawyer, first thing.

27:34.351 --> 27:36.961
Yeah! I'm sure my lawyer

27:36.967 --> 27:40.368
is gonna be very interested
to read this 'contract'.

27:40.454 --> 27:42.377
N-no... please!

27:42.383 --> 27:43.741
_

27:46.849 --> 27:49.959
- Fuck you cancer, fuck you.
- _

27:55.502 --> 27:58.978
Oh no... has it spread?

27:59.182 --> 28:03.588
No. No, no, i-i-it hasn't. Um...

28:06.508 --> 28:08.824
- Lost my dad to liver cancer last year.
-

28:08.928 --> 28:10.128
That's awful.

28:10.319 --> 28:11.817
I dunno how I'd cope.

28:12.090 --> 28:14.302
Yeah... the... the thing is...

28:14.615 --> 28:17.131
I... I don't have cancer.

28:25.108 --> 28:27.100
God, you're so funny.

28:32.265 --> 28:34.472
Hi, this is Becca, leave a message.

28:34.570 --> 28:39.382
Hey, babe. Listen, I'm taking
you out tonight, somewhere fancy.

28:39.569 --> 28:41.273
We've got something to celebrate.

28:42.802 --> 28:45.045
I can't remember the last
time you took me out on a date.

28:45.051 --> 28:48.319
Ha! Well, there'll be plenty
more dates from now on.

28:48.325 --> 28:49.528
Mmm, yeah...

28:49.803 --> 28:52.126
be it six months... two years...

28:52.132 --> 28:53.923
Well, who knows, you
might even out-live me.

28:55.371 --> 28:57.870
Well, you know, you might just be right.

28:57.876 --> 28:59.161
- Mmm.
- Um...

28:59.492 --> 29:01.354
because we're here to celebrate...

29:01.953 --> 29:03.895
- and...
- I just want you to know.

29:03.901 --> 29:06.713
that I'm going to be here for
you, throughout your illness.

29:06.884 --> 29:09.384
Oh, that... that means so much to me.

29:10.111 --> 29:11.994
- Anyway, er...
- And to think I've given up on you.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.205
It's just...

29:13.559 --> 29:15.899
Well, I promise I won't again,
not now that you are sick.

29:19.444 --> 29:20.842
Um...

29:22.334 --> 29:25.049
- Don't take this the wrong way...
- Mmm.

29:25.551 --> 29:26.751
but...

29:28.980 --> 29:32.402
Do you only love me now,

29:32.482 --> 29:36.776
because of my, you know, illness?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.176
I'm not gonna lie to you...

29:44.853 --> 29:47.892
yes, but it's made you a better person.

29:48.462 --> 29:52.353
You're more thoughtful,
loving, and, well...

29:53.048 --> 29:54.394
honest.

29:56.537 --> 29:57.856
Wow...

29:58.630 --> 30:01.966
it's almost like, me
getting cancer was...

30:02.038 --> 30:05.251
- what our relationship needed.
- Yeah.

30:06.316 --> 30:07.615
Cheers.

30:17.713 --> 30:18.978
Tomorrow...

30:19.689 --> 30:21.449
I'll tell her tomorrow.

30:27.622 --> 30:29.686
- Ooh. Shit,
- What?

30:29.692 --> 30:31.608
I've left my phone at the
restaurant. I have to go back.

30:31.614 --> 30:33.717
- Uh, do you want me to come with?
- No, no, no, no. You go in.

30:33.723 --> 30:35.217
Yeah, uh, I'll pop by the shop too.

30:35.223 --> 30:37.703
- Do you want me to get you some beers?
- Oh, you're the best.

30:48.742 --> 30:52.855
_

30:52.861 --> 30:55.168
_

30:55.541 --> 30:57.941
_

30:57.947 --> 31:00.539
_

31:00.847 --> 31:04.154
Dude, that's such amazing
news! You must be so relieved.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.451
Yeah...

31:05.457 --> 31:07.164
Look, it sounds awful, but...

31:07.441 --> 31:10.086
having cancer all
week has been so great.

31:10.575 --> 31:12.270
My job's safe...

31:12.598 --> 31:14.457
people giving me stuff...

31:14.582 --> 31:16.684
- Becca's taken me back,
- That's great.

31:16.690 --> 31:19.987
you know, and last night she
even... she even licked my, uh...

31:20.077 --> 31:22.629
Licked your what? Your balls?

31:22.739 --> 31:25.154
No, no, um, behind there.

31:25.160 --> 31:28.639
- Wow... what was that like?
- Yeah...

31:28.645 --> 31:31.131
yeah, no, it was... it was
all right, I guess. It was...

31:31.137 --> 31:32.934
a bit uncomfortable.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.766
I've got twenty minutes.

31:43.954 --> 31:46.334
And this is all gonna
end when I tell everyone.

31:46.340 --> 31:49.319
What do you mean "when"? You...
you haven't told Becca yet?

31:49.325 --> 31:52.132
No... no, I was gonna
tell her tonight but...

31:52.418 --> 31:54.139
You know, the right
moment didn't come up.

31:54.145 --> 31:55.826
Well, when is the
right moment? I mean...

31:55.832 --> 31:57.872
the next time she's
licking your asshole?

32:00.473 --> 32:02.282
This just feels wrong.

32:02.567 --> 32:03.767
I know.

32:04.137 --> 32:05.790
And not hot wrong.

32:06.062 --> 32:07.262
Yeah, I know.

32:10.309 --> 32:12.635
He's dying, we shouldn't be doing this.

32:14.503 --> 32:17.132
I was all ready to leave
him, and now this...

32:17.138 --> 32:18.535
He needs me. I feel awful.

32:18.541 --> 32:21.413
- I feel awful, he was my best friend.
- Yeah, and I'm his girlfriend.

32:21.419 --> 32:24.282
He needs me, he's got cancer,
Ash. I've got to be there for him.

32:24.288 --> 32:26.093
- Not sexually.
- Ugh!

32:26.099 --> 32:28.697
No. God, no. I can't leave him now.

32:28.703 --> 32:31.380
Everyone will just be saying how
much of a heartless bitch you were.

32:31.386 --> 32:32.920
Uh, what about you?

32:32.926 --> 32:35.371
Screwing your best friend's
girlfriend while he's dying.

32:35.377 --> 32:36.868
Not to mention your wife and baby.

32:37.007 --> 32:39.302
Why do bad things always happen to me?

32:41.296 --> 32:42.573
We should end this.

32:42.823 --> 32:44.023
You're right.

32:46.712 --> 32:49.705
- I think we should end this right now.
- We can't see each other again.

32:49.711 --> 32:50.920
After this one.

32:50.926 --> 32:54.236
Yeah, this... this is the
last one. It's the last one.

32:57.609 --> 32:58.959
Oh, Ash!

32:59.038 --> 33:00.238
Ash!

33:09.590 --> 33:10.790
_

33:10.796 --> 33:12.052
Shush.

33:12.577 --> 33:13.777
_

33:13.804 --> 33:15.702
_

33:18.874 --> 33:20.074
_

33:26.725 --> 33:27.925
Hello.

33:28.080 --> 33:31.285
It's work. They want
to know where you are.

33:31.465 --> 33:33.989
Can you tell 'em I've...
I've left already, my love.

33:58.754 --> 34:02.390
If you tell her, she'll leave you.

34:03.747 --> 34:04.947
Will she?

34:05.548 --> 34:07.165
She wouldn't do that.

34:08.119 --> 34:09.364
Would she?

34:10.201 --> 34:12.426
No. No more lies.

34:16.279 --> 34:18.353
Hi, this is Becca. Leave a message.

34:18.411 --> 34:19.688
Rebecca.

34:20.666 --> 34:23.416
Yeah, I-I-I just want
you to know that I, uh...

34:23.783 --> 34:27.123
I just want you to know,
I don't have cancer!

34:28.237 --> 34:30.208
Yeah, it-it-it was all a mistake.

34:30.214 --> 34:33.130
Um, I just found out,
total misdiagnosis.

34:33.791 --> 34:36.300
Um, isn't that amazing? Um...

34:36.306 --> 34:40.599
Anyway, I-I-I can't wait to see
you and... and.. and to celebrate.

34:41.290 --> 34:42.884
I love you so much.

34:43.369 --> 34:44.678
Okay, bye.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.493
Oh, there you are.

34:54.571 --> 34:57.595
That's... so weird, I was just
leaving you a voice mess...

34:57.799 --> 34:58.999
Follow me.

35:01.742 --> 35:03.553
Here he is!

35:03.559 --> 35:06.061
Oh, surprise!

35:09.835 --> 35:13.139
Um, Daniel, I-I... I
would just like to say,

35:13.145 --> 35:17.520
uh, myself, Mr West and,
well everybody at We Cover

35:17.706 --> 35:19.327
are here for you...

35:19.394 --> 35:20.926
Hear, hear!

35:21.317 --> 35:23.918
...and, uh, a trust has
been set up in your name

35:23.924 --> 35:28.715
that will help go in to, uh, funding
research into oesophageal cancer.

35:29.157 --> 35:30.388
Wow.

35:30.478 --> 35:33.611
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

35:33.617 --> 35:34.817
Yeah.

35:35.776 --> 35:36.976
Um...

35:37.360 --> 35:38.560
Yeah, uh...

35:38.566 --> 35:40.863
You... you guys...

35:41.219 --> 35:44.719
uh, you know, you... you've been so...

35:45.268 --> 35:46.468
great.

35:46.609 --> 35:47.809
Um...

35:48.811 --> 35:50.718
You're not gonna believe this...

35:51.403 --> 35:53.123
but I...

36:02.911 --> 36:04.428
I love you.

36:06.083 --> 36:07.283
Okay.

36:08.111 --> 36:10.927
I remember everything
about the day I was...

36:11.011 --> 36:12.892
diagnosed with cancer.

36:16.324 --> 36:18.197
I still bear the scars.

36:19.943 --> 36:22.185
You are all my family, now...

36:23.449 --> 36:26.446
And I am your... Queen...

36:27.916 --> 36:29.908
of hearts.

36:30.029 --> 36:33.839
Queen of... Queen of hearts. Queen...

36:35.111 --> 36:36.676
Whoo!

36:37.140 --> 36:38.340
Uh, Dad!

36:38.346 --> 36:42.187
Humphrey Bogart died
of oesophageal cancer.

36:43.215 --> 36:44.895
Oh, really?

36:45.163 --> 36:46.363
Oh God.

36:46.369 --> 36:48.577
I wanted you to phone everyday.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.053
Yep, no, I will. Yeah.

36:51.059 --> 36:53.583
Uh, otherwise your mum will worry.

36:53.589 --> 36:54.789
Yeah.

36:56.464 --> 36:57.769
Thanks, Dad.

36:57.988 --> 36:59.941
- Oh!
- Ooh.

37:01.200 --> 37:02.684
Ah... ha-ha.

37:23.708 --> 37:25.917
Dr Iain Glennis speaking.

37:26.060 --> 37:29.220
Okay, I'm not gonna tell
anyone about your mistake.

37:30.025 --> 37:32.302
Ah, that is...

37:32.679 --> 37:36.181
absolutely wonderful.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.008
But you've got to do something for me.

37:38.014 --> 37:39.539
Yes, anything.

37:39.545 --> 37:42.153
We're gonna pretend I've got cancer,

37:42.222 --> 37:44.732
and then we're gonna
say that you cured me.

37:44.848 --> 37:47.145
Will people believe us? Can we do it?

37:47.151 --> 37:48.559
Yeah, yes.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.882
Yes. Yes, we can do this.

37:52.496 --> 37:53.748
Okay.

37:54.894 --> 37:56.397
I've got cancer then.

38:29.987 --> 38:31.229
Oh, I love you.

38:32.820 --> 38:34.432
You misspelled suicide.

38:37.432 --> 38:39.726
Mmm, you were so brave today, baby.

38:39.732 --> 38:41.838
Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.

38:43.424 --> 38:46.159
- I'm gonna check my messages.
- Mmm.

38:49.254 --> 38:52.847
- Mmm, there's one from you.
- You have two new messages.

38:52.853 --> 38:54.165
Rebecca...

38:54.953 --> 38:57.117
- Yeah, I-I just want you to know that...
- Arrrgh!

38:57.123 --> 38:59.054
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's my cancer.

38:59.216 --> 39:01.921
Ooh! Oh, could you put that down
and... and just get me a glass

39:01.927 --> 39:04.146
- a glass of water? Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.044
I've got something to tell you...

39:09.109 --> 39:10.338
I don't have can...

39:12.814 --> 39:16.198
- Well, should I take you to a hospital?
- Oh, no, no, it's been so... it's passed.

39:16.714 --> 39:17.914
I'm okay.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.822
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah. Thanks, babe.

39:19.828 --> 39:22.149
Oh, God... poor thing.

39:24.032 --> 39:25.232
Oh...

39:29.501 --> 39:31.004
_

39:35.285 --> 39:37.379
Uh-oh! Oh!

39:37.385 --> 39:38.896
Hard at work, are we?

39:38.902 --> 39:41.256
Well, I'm only paying you
for another six months, so...

39:41.262 --> 39:42.792
Oh, Mr West.

39:43.574 --> 39:45.578
So, any news on my Stressthumbs?

39:45.584 --> 39:48.389
I'm sorry but it's thumb down.

39:48.395 --> 39:51.756
The lab boys said it was
commercially not viable.

39:51.762 --> 39:54.325
- I thought those trials took months.
- I fast-tracked it.

39:54.331 --> 39:56.544
I was just so sure they'd be a hit.

39:56.760 --> 39:57.960
You know,

39:57.966 --> 40:02.744
an early lunch with Kenny West
will turn that frown upside down.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.726
Really? That girl from accounts

40:04.732 --> 40:06.861
seemed pretty upset when
you took her out last month.

40:07.062 --> 40:10.731
Oh, look, you have a
customer. Cancer cunt.

40:18.192 --> 40:20.037
_

40:20.318 --> 40:22.498
Okay, so that was
definitely the last time.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.045
Yeah, it's over.

40:24.904 --> 40:27.448
You know, we should be doing
nice things for Daniel, not this.

40:27.454 --> 40:28.654
You're right.

40:29.051 --> 40:32.225
Hey, I'll get him a secret cinema
ticket. They're doing Gladiator.

40:33.051 --> 40:34.369
Whatever, come on.

40:34.375 --> 40:36.949
Yeah, and I just need to...

40:37.398 --> 40:38.598
you know.

40:38.604 --> 40:40.555
Ew! I'm not waiting
around for that. Just...

40:40.561 --> 40:42.885
ugh, just make the bed
and let yourself out.

40:54.326 --> 40:56.810
_

40:56.907 --> 40:59.115
Hey, buddy. You okay?

40:59.204 --> 41:00.795
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

41:00.801 --> 41:02.963
Listen, they're given
me the afternoon off.

41:02.969 --> 41:06.785
I was thinking we could grab
a few drinks, play some pool.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.448
You about?

41:09.503 --> 41:10.703
Ash?

41:12.163 --> 41:14.660
- Ash, are you still there?
- Yeah, man.

41:15.043 --> 41:18.178
It just went really
quiet. Can barely hear you.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.537
Yeah, um... I'm just on the toilet.

41:20.543 --> 41:22.939
Oh, great. You've been
taking a dump this whole time?

41:22.945 --> 41:24.145
Oh, sorry.

41:25.379 --> 41:29.852
Um, look, you got the Game of
Thrones Blu-Ray box set, right?

41:29.858 --> 41:32.560
Uh, Torch-Winterfell Edition, yes.

41:32.566 --> 41:35.766
Could you just, um, help me
check something on the back?

41:35.772 --> 41:37.077
Can't it wait?

41:37.763 --> 41:40.138
It's just, it's kind of an emergency.

41:48.039 --> 41:49.341
What the fuck!

41:51.832 --> 41:54.928
Yeah, okay man. Uh,
what... what you wanna know?

41:55.208 --> 41:57.334
What special features are listed?

41:58.521 --> 41:59.948
Uh, photo gallery,

41:59.954 --> 42:03.811
anatomy of an episode featurette,
the season 7 preview...

42:06.094 --> 42:07.514
You're welcome.

42:15.727 --> 42:18.142
Oh! That's not one of mine.

42:18.148 --> 42:20.220
She'd kill me if I forgot to flush that.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.460
It's like I've won the lottery.

42:25.466 --> 42:28.949
- By lying about having cancer?
- It's only for six months...

42:29.238 --> 42:32.152
okay? And then everyone
will think I've beat it.

42:32.519 --> 42:36.747
And then get my life back on
track and no one will ever know...

42:36.753 --> 42:39.528
- I... faked cancer.
- You faked it?

42:40.707 --> 42:41.907
Who's that?

42:42.538 --> 42:44.944
Ash? What are you doing on my window?

42:44.950 --> 42:47.929
You... you lied to
everyone. You lied to me.

42:47.935 --> 42:49.275
What is going on?

42:51.441 --> 42:53.440
_

42:54.127 --> 42:56.713
- You and Becca?
- I cried for you, Daniel.

42:56.719 --> 43:00.090
- I cried for days, you're my best friend.
- Who's fucking my girlfriend!

43:00.096 --> 43:01.785
Gonna give you secret cinema tickets!

43:01.791 --> 43:04.411
- They're doing Gladiator!
- You've just had a baby!

43:04.417 --> 43:06.687
Becca's my girlfriend
and you're my best...

43:06.693 --> 43:08.081
Aaaah!

43:09.061 --> 43:10.496
Ash!

43:11.188 --> 43:12.388
Shit.

43:15.763 --> 43:16.963
Daniel?

43:17.576 --> 43:19.281
Dude, you still there?

43:19.927 --> 43:21.127
Daniel?

43:25.738 --> 43:28.347
- Do you wanna go to prison for murder?
- Murder?!

43:33.054 --> 43:34.758
Oh, for Pete's sake.

43:37.545 --> 43:39.246
You bastard!

43:42.709 --> 43:44.397
I thought you'd been arrested.
