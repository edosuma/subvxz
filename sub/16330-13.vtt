You're in a lot of trouble, Cadet Weller.

00:26.660 --> 00:29.283
This is the third time
you've broken your curfew,

00:29.354 --> 00:31.645
and you're not even halfway
through the semester.

00:32.011 --> 00:35.480
I thought this was a
school, not a prison, sir.

00:35.993 --> 00:37.673
We have rules.

00:37.708 --> 00:38.988
Where were you sneaking off to?

00:39.048 --> 00:40.530
I need to check on my sister.

00:40.565 --> 00:43.789
- Why?
- My father...

00:43.824 --> 00:46.183
She can't defend herself. He's a monster.

00:46.248 --> 00:48.689
I know you're still angry with
your dad for sending you here.

00:48.763 --> 00:50.110
No, that's not it.

00:50.145 --> 00:52.516
This is your last warning, Cadet.

00:52.601 --> 00:54.844
Expel me. I hate it here.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.923
No... you don't get off that easy.

00:59.256 --> 01:01.357
You need this school more than you know.

01:02.528 --> 01:04.944
Now go outside... and wait for security

01:04.980 --> 01:07.014
to escort you back to the dorms.

01:14.413 --> 01:16.897
Quite a mess you've gotten yourself into.

01:19.043 --> 01:20.866
It's okay to be angry.

01:20.901 --> 01:22.105
Anger's good.

01:22.177 --> 01:24.859
But you have to know where to put it.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.289
Giving a school guard a black eye is...

01:28.397 --> 01:29.748
short-sighted.

01:29.783 --> 01:31.639
You get kicked out, then what?

Doubt you could do much for your sister

01:38.453 --> 01:40.876
To really protect people...

01:42.152 --> 01:43.957

Really? You never miss a workout.

Well, it's just us, Three Amigos.

lead with Jane and Naas.

03:24.928 --> 03:26.212
All right. What do we got?

03:26.261 --> 03:29.376
Okay, so, as we all know,
the text on Jane's back

03:29.411 --> 03:33.405
is a mish-mash of various passages
from famous literary works.

03:33.466 --> 03:34.972
Buried in there are Bible verses

03:35.007 --> 03:39.008
from the book of Genesis,
including Genesis 3:25.

03:39.043 --> 03:41.777
"But it was the Father who
sent his envoy, the serpent,

03:41.812 --> 03:44.302
to tempt his children
and lead them astray."

03:44.337 --> 03:46.609
I haven't been to church in a while,
but that doesn't sound familiar.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.293
That's because it doesn't exist.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.105
There is no Genesis 3:25,

03:51.140 --> 03:53.086
but this morning, one of my systems

03:53.121 --> 03:55.210
picked up the phrase "Genesis 3:25"

03:55.268 --> 03:57.572
over some chatter, and
I was able to track it

03:57.607 --> 04:00.726
to a man named Jared Wisnewski.

04:00.796 --> 04:04.106
Single guy, runs a local
farmers co-op upstate.

04:04.163 --> 04:06.352
A few hunting rifles
registered to his name.

04:06.387 --> 04:08.004
Okay, so a mild-mannered farmer

04:08.080 --> 04:11.496
references a Bible verse that
doesn't exist in the chatter?

04:11.531 --> 04:13.201
- Barely a lead.
- I thought so, too.

04:13.249 --> 04:14.921
But the coincidence didn't
sit well with Weller,

04:14.979 --> 04:16.103
and he wanted us to dig into it.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.521
How exactly did this
alert your tattoo database?

I don't want to bore you
with the intricate details.

04:21.211 --> 04:22.824
- Since when?
- It's... It's just...

04:22.859 --> 04:26.944
It's a whole mess of algorithms
and just so much math.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.327
All right, we're gonna
head up to Wisnewski's farm

04:28.385 --> 04:29.945
and see if we can find anything.

04:31.108 --> 04:32.490
- Let's move.
- Let's move.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.109
You should have seen Kurt back then.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.559
Spent more time in this office than class.

04:40.612 --> 04:43.205
Can't believe he turned
out to be an FBI agent.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.028
Assistant Director of the FBI, actually.

04:46.099 --> 04:47.656
Impressive.

You both work for the FBI, too?

Sure.

04:52.755 --> 04:54.252

(chuckling) That's Ellen Briggs.

04:56.866 --> 04:59.121
What was her connection to the academy?

04:59.207 --> 05:00.802
Ellen was in the Army.

05:00.877 --> 05:02.197
She visited once a semester

05:02.267 --> 05:04.768
to talk about her work serving abroad.

05:04.808 --> 05:07.502
Spent a lot of time in
Africa, the Middle East.

05:07.912 --> 05:10.288

05:10.839 --> 05:11.897
What do you mean?

05:12.527 --> 05:14.361
Well, I was...

05:14.396 --> 05:16.114
this close to kicking you out of here,

05:16.190 --> 05:19.931
and Ellen convinced me you
deserved another chance.

05:20.089 --> 05:23.077
I don't understand. She convinced you?

05:23.112 --> 05:24.798
You could say that.

05:24.833 --> 05:26.661
What aren't you telling me, sir?

05:27.647 --> 05:30.133
Your dad, he was having a hard time

05:30.194 --> 05:33.144
covering your tuition.
She offered to sponsor you.

My scholarship came from
a state-funded lottery.

05:35.423 --> 05:39.111
No, it didn't. Ellen
wanted to remain anonymous.

05:39.171 --> 05:43.792
You're telling me that Ellen
Briggs funded my entire education?

She saw something in you.

05:51.243 --> 05:52.208
Anything?

otherwise known as Ellen Briggs.

06:37.829 --> 06:41.189
Even the simplest information is
hidden behind layers of military

06:41.224 --> 06:42.907
security clearances and encryption.

06:42.965 --> 06:45.111
But now we know that
she was a Major General,

Deputy Director of the Defense
Threat Reduction Agency.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.959
Holding such a high rank
in the military would

06:49.994 --> 06:51.456
explain how she had access to some of

06:51.518 --> 06:53.629
the classified information on Jane's body.

06:53.683 --> 06:56.223
And why she'd have friends

Most of her record is heavily redacted

06:59.778 --> 07:01.832
or just missing from the system entirely.

07:01.909 --> 07:03.265
I've been searching for connections,

07:03.364 --> 07:06.295
and one name popped up... Sean Clark.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.144
He was a training officer at Fort Meade

07:08.189 --> 07:09.310
when Shepherd was stationed there.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.247
They worked together for years.

07:11.313 --> 07:12.891
But then there's this.

07:12.945 --> 07:15.556
Clark retired from a post
at the DOJ a year ago,

07:15.628 --> 07:17.049
then suffered a stroke.

07:17.113 --> 07:20.159
He's been at an assisted living
center in Westchester ever since.

07:20.233 --> 07:22.687
It took some digging, but
the shell corporation paying

07:22.745 --> 07:26.181
his bills has connections to
the same one that sponsored

07:26.216 --> 07:28.107
Weller's military school scholarship.

07:28.165 --> 07:30.657
So Shepherd's paying Sean
Clark's medical bills?

07:30.729 --> 07:32.738
That means that he's important to her.

So, you just overslept, huh?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.702
You know you can still talk
to me about Coach Jones, right?

07:45.593 --> 07:47.888
Jones is dead.

07:48.774 --> 07:50.784
That doesn't mean what he did goes away.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.830
Do you ever think about maybe

07:52.865 --> 07:55.156
trying to talk to somebody,
trying to deal with...

07:55.222 --> 07:57.413
There's nothing to deal with.
Jones is dead. It's over.

No car in the driveway.

It's a big farm. Let's check around back.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.593
- Home shooting range?
- That seems a little excessive.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.862
I don't remember him having an
AK-47 registered in his name.

08:33.020 --> 08:35.551
This guy's got a huge
stockpile of automatic weapons.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.583
And all the ingredients
to make an ANFO bomb.

08:40.092 --> 08:42.193
- I'm gonna call in a warrant.
- I'll let Weller know.

08:45.286 --> 08:46.707
Ellen Briggs...

She's gone where?

08:52.657 --> 08:55.838
Three-two count. Backdoor slider.

08:56.314 --> 09:00.485
He... Gibson, he cracks
one to the bleachers,

09:00.562 --> 09:02.215

09:02.296 --> 09:06.453
Yeah... 1988 World Series.

09:08.476 --> 09:11.541
Sean, do you remember me?

09:12.557 --> 09:14.443
I'm Ellen's daughter, Remi.

09:15.453 --> 09:17.287
You're not on the Dodgers.

09:21.917 --> 09:23.303
Excuse us.

09:27.103 --> 09:29.849
I just talked with Sean's doctor.

09:29.884 --> 09:32.980
His stroke resulted in
significant brain trauma.

09:33.045 --> 09:35.117
His vascular dementia is
better on some days, but...

09:35.152 --> 09:37.185
Yeah, well, we caught
him on a really bad day.

09:37.220 --> 09:40.194
Perhaps that's why Shepherd
isn't afraid of him talking.

09:40.251 --> 09:41.975
It's another dead end.

09:42.041 --> 09:43.775
All he can remember is baseball.

09:44.777 --> 09:47.098
Wait, maybe talk to him about baseball.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.668
I mean, familiar things
help me with my memories.

09:53.371 --> 09:56.783
Mr. Clark, do you like the Pirates?

09:56.818 --> 10:01.508
Cordova and Rincon's
combined no-hitter in '97?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.082
I almost went to that game.

10:05.453 --> 10:06.719
I know you.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.676
How? From where?

10:12.390 --> 10:14.258
You play on the Mets.

10:21.052 --> 10:23.258
You should have been a National,

10:24.090 --> 10:26.272
but they could never let that happen.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.499
Never.

10:35.158 --> 10:37.636
Thank you, Mr. Clark.

10:38.134 --> 10:39.493
You have a great day.

10:41.756 --> 10:42.682
(Zapata) Welcome back.

10:42.738 --> 10:44.770
We seized a huge cache
of automatic weapons,

10:44.812 --> 10:47.993
demolition charges, nitrogen
fertilizer, and diesel fuel.

10:48.066 --> 10:49.700
Wisnewski isn't a mild-mannered farmer.

10:49.768 --> 10:52.688
He's using his farm as a
domestic terrorist training camp.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.377
So he's making an ANFO bomb?

10:54.423 --> 10:55.323
ANFO?

10:55.384 --> 10:57.215
Aluminum Nitrate Fuel Oil explosive.

10:57.266 --> 10:59.238
Same type of bomb they
used in Oklahoma City.

10:59.308 --> 11:01.263
- Where is this guy now?
- We have a BOLO out on his car,

11:01.331 --> 11:02.760

11:02.836 --> 11:03.970
- Oh, my God!
- What?

11:04.005 --> 11:06.141

(Weller) Where?

11:07.074 --> 11:08.413
Here, in this building.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.009
He just exited the third floor elevator.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.611
Counterterrorism Division.

11:18.085 --> 11:20.486
Down! Stop! Get on the ground!

11:20.521 --> 11:21.621
On the ground!

11:21.790 --> 11:23.824
- Are you armed?
- No.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.659
What are you doing here?
Is this building a target?

11:27.717 --> 11:29.352
I don't understand. I'm an informant.

11:29.407 --> 11:31.582
I work for the FBI.

11:42.376 --> 11:45.286
Are these really necessary?
I'm an informant for you guys.

11:45.321 --> 11:46.537
You're not in our system,

11:48.951 --> 11:50.804
Agent Boyd can vouch for me.

11:50.839 --> 11:53.336
He's on his way in, but right now,

11:53.394 --> 11:55.750
you're gonna start
talking to the both of us.

11:56.285 --> 11:58.894
I run a farmers co-op upstate.

11:58.929 --> 12:01.585
A lot of us in the community were angry.

12:01.661 --> 12:03.694
The government is pushing us off our land.

12:03.729 --> 12:06.069
First, in the '90s, it was a freeway.

12:06.135 --> 12:08.036
Now, it's a gas pipeline.

12:08.111 --> 12:10.187
People can't make a living anymore.

12:10.222 --> 12:11.788
Agent Boyd was concerned

12:11.822 --> 12:13.586
that the anti-government
sentiment could lead

12:13.621 --> 12:15.729
to a homegrown domestic cell.

12:15.850 --> 12:18.940
He wanted me to keep an
eye on things, report back.

12:18.998 --> 12:22.292
I identified a few key people
that were angrier than others

12:22.366 --> 12:24.014
- and passed those names along.
- All right.

12:24.049 --> 12:27.799
So, how does passing on a few names

12:27.865 --> 12:29.429
turn into a terror attack?

12:30.731 --> 12:32.042
It was Boyd's idea.

12:32.116 --> 12:33.433
(Reade) Come again?

12:33.497 --> 12:37.612
Are you saying an agent told
you to start building ANFO bombs?

12:37.682 --> 12:39.939
He wanted me to gauge the group's interest

12:40.013 --> 12:41.851
in acting on their anger.

12:41.917 --> 12:45.014
The pipeline is gonna
break ground on March 25th.

12:45.082 --> 12:47.924
He wanted to know if that
was an enticing target.

12:48.002 --> 12:49.016
I brought it up.

12:49.085 --> 12:50.729
People went along.

12:50.798 --> 12:53.345
March 25th. Genesis 3:25.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.150
That's the codename for
your pipeline attack?

12:55.197 --> 12:56.942
Genesis means the beginning,

12:56.977 --> 12:58.486
and we were gonna end it.

12:58.579 --> 13:00.497
By what, blowing it up?

13:00.532 --> 13:03.747
Boyd and his team were gonna swoop
in before anything got deadly.

13:03.815 --> 13:06.311
What you're describing is entrapment.

13:06.377 --> 13:09.002
Now, my office does not radicalize people

13:09.073 --> 13:12.231
or create a terror cell
just to take them down.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.758
- Agent Boyd.
- I can explain this.

13:15.979 --> 13:16.959
(Weller) Stop.

13:17.388 --> 13:19.002
My office, now.

13:23.932 --> 13:25.852
It's a successful program.

13:25.936 --> 13:27.436
I wouldn't know. There's no record.

13:27.478 --> 13:29.044
Well, I couldn't leave a paper trail for

13:29.096 --> 13:31.463
- this kind of operation.
- Yeah, because it's against the law.

13:31.535 --> 13:33.446
These people would not
be planning this attack

13:33.481 --> 13:34.977
if you hadn't have given them the idea.

13:35.044 --> 13:37.570
I'm just moving up the
timeline on the inevitable.

13:37.605 --> 13:40.604
These people are angry.
They hate the government.

13:40.639 --> 13:42.843
Yeah, and that does
not make them criminals.

13:42.878 --> 13:45.004
Look, if we don't root
out this kind of stuff now,

13:45.072 --> 13:47.458
we'll be dealing with the aftermath later.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.803
Think about Ruby Ridge,

13:49.866 --> 13:51.771
Cliven Bundy, Timothy McVeigh.

13:51.838 --> 13:53.339
I'm shutting you down, Boyd.

13:54.944 --> 13:56.664
You pull the plug, this group will

13:56.735 --> 13:58.525
carry out the attack without Jared.

13:58.585 --> 13:59.810
Not if we arrest them first.

13:59.862 --> 14:01.283
We don't have the evidence to make arrests.

14:01.361 --> 14:03.763
This was all about getting
them for the big attack.

14:03.814 --> 14:06.270
And we've got Jared's weapons
and his bomb materials.

14:06.348 --> 14:08.535
A third grader could make more ANFO,

14:08.605 --> 14:09.832
and you know it.

14:09.867 --> 14:10.956
We let this go,

14:11.008 --> 14:12.481
and something bad is gonna happen.

14:12.536 --> 14:13.961
I want you to put together
everything that you have

14:14.010 --> 14:15.500
on this and then give it to me.

14:15.535 --> 14:18.631
I will decide whether this
op moves forward or not.

14:24.885 --> 14:27.914
We were hoping these photos
could help you remember something.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.042
Who is she?

14:32.112 --> 14:33.433
You remember her?

14:33.468 --> 14:36.442
I have this feeling. It's hard to explain.

14:36.477 --> 14:37.986
I can't... I can't remember her,

14:38.047 --> 14:40.971
but she feels familiar.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.459
I know her, don't I?

14:42.545 --> 14:45.330
That's Shepherd, our mother.

14:45.408 --> 14:47.014
Her real name is Ellen Briggs.

14:47.049 --> 14:48.400
She was an Army General.

14:48.435 --> 14:50.007
I need to know everything about her.

14:50.085 --> 14:51.252
Well, we don't know much right now,

14:51.289 --> 14:53.965
and the files we found on
her are mostly redacted.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.341
I need to see them.

14:55.376 --> 14:58.073
I'm not sure that the FBI
is willing to hand over

14:58.108 --> 15:00.708
classified documents to someone in custody.

15:00.743 --> 15:01.564
I know her, I...

15:01.619 --> 15:03.454
Look, I know it's frustrating and...

15:03.489 --> 15:06.812
How am I supposed to help if they
won't share everything with me?

15:07.060 --> 15:09.014
What are they hiding?

15:09.096 --> 15:11.631
I'll talk to Nas, okay?

15:21.366 --> 15:22.826
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:22.891 --> 15:25.110
I'm doing great. What's going on?

15:25.188 --> 15:27.495
How exactly did you crack
the Bible verse tattoo?

15:27.530 --> 15:30.939
You told me on the phone you picked
up the phrase on some chatter.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.401
You're never this interested
in how I solve the tattoos.

15:33.472 --> 15:35.397
This one points to an
off-the-book program

15:35.483 --> 15:37.209
being run out of this office,

15:37.795 --> 15:40.880
so I need to know what is
happening under my watch,

15:40.950 --> 15:42.265
and I need to know now.

15:42.336 --> 15:44.688
Uh, okay.

15:44.766 --> 15:48.554
I linked the tattoo database to a
secret NSA data collection program.

15:49.723 --> 15:51.437
Omaha? Nas told me

15:51.472 --> 15:52.892
it's very similar to Daylight.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.110
Daylight on steroids is more accurate.

15:55.145 --> 15:58.379
So you've been using illegal
wiretaps to solve these tattoos?

16:00.010 --> 16:01.981
- Patterson.
- This was the first one.

16:02.035 --> 16:03.347
- Really?
- I know... it's just,

16:03.409 --> 16:05.801
I have to use every resource that I have.

16:05.897 --> 16:07.437
We're running out of time

16:07.472 --> 16:09.141
to figure out what all of this adds up to.

16:09.176 --> 16:13.145
That is my call to make,
not yours, understand?

16:21.403 --> 16:23.402
As much as I want to
shut this program down,

16:23.465 --> 16:26.304
we can't risk an attack being
carried out by this domestic cell.

16:26.339 --> 16:28.964
Great, I've outlined a way to
wrap this up in three months.

16:29.013 --> 16:30.824
Forget it. This is my op now.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.768
- We do it my way.
- Sir, with all due respect,

16:32.803 --> 16:34.131
I've been working on this for two years.

16:34.178 --> 16:35.681
Yeah, and you messed it up,

16:35.752 --> 16:37.460
so you want me to keep you on this,

16:37.531 --> 16:39.522
tell me everything that I need to know.

16:41.681 --> 16:44.545
These are the players that Jared
planned the pipeline attack with.

16:44.602 --> 16:46.022
So what do we know about them?

16:46.075 --> 16:47.966
Tom Moses, cattle rancher

16:48.020 --> 16:51.691
who turned a peaceful community
protest into a small riot.

16:51.753 --> 16:54.431
The incident ignited this
powder keg in the first place.

16:54.504 --> 16:56.874
His cousin Kevin Pabst is a distributor

16:56.909 --> 16:59.245
who brings the co-op's
cattle to the market.

16:59.307 --> 17:01.085
And lastly, Tess Bartell.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.295
She served two tours in the Iraq war,

17:03.365 --> 17:05.097
took over the family
farm when she returned.

17:05.132 --> 17:06.501
What about the rest of the community?

17:06.556 --> 17:07.921
Are they aware of an attack?

17:07.961 --> 17:10.638
A few other people in the community
were interested in joining the cause.

17:10.689 --> 17:12.076
We were gonna read 'em in soon.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.724
Let's focus on these three.

17:13.795 --> 17:16.076
We'll make arrests when we've
got enough evidence on them.

17:16.111 --> 17:17.664
Jared's been out of contact with them

17:17.718 --> 17:19.096
since your team raided his farm.

17:19.131 --> 17:21.287
He needs to let 'em know
that the plan is safe,

17:21.321 --> 17:23.255
that the attack can still move forward.

17:23.354 --> 17:26.819
No. I don't want him
out in the field again.

17:26.898 --> 17:28.204
He's the leader of the group.

17:28.279 --> 17:31.760
If he disappears, they'll
know something's wrong.

17:31.811 --> 17:35.017
We have a prearranged meeting
spot that's easy to surveil.

17:35.052 --> 17:36.453
I can do this.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.620
- (ringing)
- (Tess) <i>Jared?</i>

17:39.655 --> 17:40.808
Hey, Tess, listen.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.898
<i>Your place is crawling with cops.</i>

17:42.933 --> 17:45.938
I'm fine, but we have to talk.

17:45.973 --> 17:49.500
Get Kevin and Tom and meet
in the normal spot in an hour.

17:49.566 --> 17:52.014
<i>No. The orchard on Old Post Road.</i>

17:53.917 --> 17:56.489
What's wrong with the
usual spot? It's secure.

17:56.559 --> 17:58.015
<i>If the Feds knew about your farm,</i>

17:58.073 --> 17:59.971
<i>they could know about
our meeting spot, too.</i>

18:00.006 --> 18:02.398
Tess, there's no way they
could know about that.

18:02.433 --> 18:03.999
<i>See you in an hour.</i>

18:04.058 --> 18:05.183
(call disconnects)

18:11.731 --> 18:15.200
(whistling a tune)

18:18.400 --> 18:19.967
This is not a good position.

18:20.002 --> 18:21.364
Not one sightline to where they're meeting.

18:21.399 --> 18:24.016
If we get any closer, they'll spot us.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.585
We'll know everything that's going on

18:25.632 --> 18:27.449
through the mic we put in Jared's truck.

18:27.484 --> 18:29.809
(Zapata) <i>We got something.</i>

18:29.844 --> 18:32.212
A jeep and a bike approaching
from the north end.

18:36.084 --> 18:37.733
(Weller) <i>Got it. Stay sharp, team.</i>

18:37.803 --> 18:39.734
Anything seems off, we
move in, make the arrests.

18:39.813 --> 18:41.039
- <i>Copy?</i>
- Copy that.

18:41.079 --> 18:43.747
(revving)

18:51.815 --> 18:54.914
How the hell did the FBI
know to raid your farm, Jared?

18:54.949 --> 18:56.838
Nosy neighbor. I'm just lucky I wasn't home

18:56.878 --> 18:58.158
when they stormed the place.

18:58.210 --> 19:00.051
They got the weapons and the bombs.

19:00.086 --> 19:01.168
They could know everything.

19:01.203 --> 19:04.482
Nothing pointed to our
plan or to any of you.

19:04.517 --> 19:07.059
We have to stay the
course with Genesis 3:25.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.181
The pipeline is months
away from breaking ground.

19:10.251 --> 19:12.683
We need to gather the
others and strike today

19:12.738 --> 19:14.953
before the cops launch
a full investigation.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.818
Strike what? Where?

19:16.853 --> 19:18.779
Watch the news tonight. You'll see.

19:18.814 --> 19:21.063
Tess, don't cut me out! I started this!

19:21.098 --> 19:23.896
You're a fugitive now,
Jared. You need to lay low.

19:23.931 --> 19:26.554
<i>I need to know what you're targeting</i>

19:26.620 --> 19:29.148
to make sure that it has a real impact.

19:30.906 --> 19:32.719
You don't trust me?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.180
Or is something else going on here, Jared?

19:35.258 --> 19:36.874
Tess, what are you doing?

19:36.936 --> 19:38.647
Please, put the gun away.

19:38.682 --> 19:40.234
Jared's blown. Let's pull him out.

19:40.273 --> 19:42.251
He can handle it, she's
about to change up the target.

19:42.286 --> 19:43.745
Team, move in!

19:43.780 --> 19:46.031
(tires squealing)

19:46.066 --> 19:48.415
Why didn't you answer
your phone all day, Jared?

19:48.450 --> 19:50.154
You're being paranoid.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.567
Are you trying to set us up?

19:52.602 --> 19:54.202
You working with the Feds?

19:55.553 --> 19:58.888
We've come too far to let you ruin it.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.575
It's over. Put the gun down.

20:04.641 --> 20:06.514
The FBI is listening.

20:07.814 --> 20:09.514
(gunshot)

20:12.463 --> 20:13.696
Go!

20:19.634 --> 20:21.084
(Reade) <i>Weller, Tess
is headed to you.</i>

20:21.142 --> 20:22.322
(Boyd) <i>Stay on her.</i>

20:26.124 --> 20:28.602
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

20:28.637 --> 20:31.605
(gunfire)

20:57.191 --> 21:00.545
(Reade) Get on the ground! Now!

21:27.072 --> 21:29.600
This is everything that
we have on Shepherd.

21:29.635 --> 21:33.258
I've included images of
Fort Meade and Fort Hood.

21:33.306 --> 21:35.397
That's where we know she was stationed.

21:38.509 --> 21:41.085
Does any of it seem familiar?

21:41.120 --> 21:44.456
No, none of it. Just her.

21:45.106 --> 21:48.097
If her name is Ellen Briggs, does that
mean that my last name is Briggs, too?

21:48.169 --> 21:51.257
We didn't find any record on you or Jane.

21:51.292 --> 21:55.158
There's... There's no proof that
she was ever legally your mother.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.680
Why wouldn't she have adopted us?

21:56.744 --> 21:59.946
Well, maybe she did, and
then the records were erased.

21:59.988 --> 22:03.255
Roman, there's still a lot more
that we don't know about her.

22:07.441 --> 22:09.298
It doesn't make any sense.

22:09.857 --> 22:11.074
What?

22:11.279 --> 22:12.875
These files, they...

22:13.356 --> 22:15.979
they show a soldier who
betrayed her country.

22:16.454 --> 22:17.902
A terrorist.

22:18.481 --> 22:20.683
That's not what I feel when I look at her.

22:21.158 --> 22:24.288
It's something different. Something warm.

22:24.388 --> 22:26.236
You were taught to follow
her your whole life.

22:26.271 --> 22:28.800
It makes sense that you would feel

22:28.835 --> 22:30.955
this deep connection to her.

22:30.990 --> 22:34.230
But if I have these feelings
toward somebody who is such...

22:35.049 --> 22:38.001
a monster...

22:38.317 --> 22:40.018
what does that make me?

22:41.153 --> 22:42.668
You could have stopped this months ago.

22:42.735 --> 22:44.431
You didn't. Now Jared is dead.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.600
- We can salvage this.
- How?

22:46.677 --> 22:48.025
This group is out there with plans to hit

22:48.086 --> 22:50.193
a new target today...
we've got no idea where.

22:50.228 --> 22:52.182
We have a warrant out
for Tess Bartell's arrest.

22:52.269 --> 22:54.446
We find her, and we drill down.

22:54.481 --> 22:56.810
We won't be doing anything.

22:56.854 --> 22:58.883
Hand in your service weapon and your badge.

22:58.933 --> 23:00.939
Your career with the FBI is over.

23:04.233 --> 23:06.737
- Any luck tracking Tess down?
- We've got nothing.

23:06.795 --> 23:08.620
She ditched her bike and
has gone completely dark.

23:08.671 --> 23:10.499
Field agents are talking to
farmers who might be involved.

23:10.534 --> 23:11.640
So far, we've come up empty.

23:11.702 --> 23:12.970
What about possible targets?

23:13.024 --> 23:14.625
Kevin isn't talking, and there are five

23:14.660 --> 23:16.584
construction companies
working on the pipeline.

23:16.619 --> 23:18.890
(Reade) The project had to be signed
off on by a dozen state officials.

23:18.955 --> 23:20.391
Any one of them could be a target.

23:20.426 --> 23:22.144
I want agents at every one of those places.

23:22.182 --> 23:24.150
- (electronic tone)
- Oh, no.

23:24.185 --> 23:25.929
- This is bad.
- What?

23:25.964 --> 23:29.106
Uh, a farming supply warehouse
five miles from the orchard

23:29.162 --> 23:30.377
reported a robbery.

23:30.412 --> 23:33.537
1,000 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer
and a dozen drums of diesel fuel.

23:33.572 --> 23:36.572
Tess didn't steal that much
by herself. She has help.

23:36.637 --> 23:39.206
Now they've got enough
explosives to level any building.

23:39.241 --> 23:41.409
(beeping)

23:56.293 --> 23:57.981
I understand you're angry.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.654
I was, too, when I discovered
one of my agents was running

24:00.708 --> 24:03.149
an op targeting innocent people.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.996
I've seen what happens when
people in the government

24:05.031 --> 24:06.431
abuse their power,

24:06.841 --> 24:08.625
and it's not something I stand for,

24:09.401 --> 24:12.054
so give me the chance to make this right

24:12.366 --> 24:14.226
before anyone else gets hurt.

24:14.908 --> 24:19.147
I just wanted to keep
what was mine, my family's.

24:19.182 --> 24:21.014
We're losing everything to that pipeline.

24:21.049 --> 24:22.499
And that's not fair,

24:22.534 --> 24:24.881
but neither is killing innocent people.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.629
I never wanted to kill anybody.

24:26.664 --> 24:29.032
Yeah, but Tess is a different story.

24:29.281 --> 24:32.016
We know she's planning on
targeting something big.

24:33.299 --> 24:36.179
Kevin, everyone that she kills

24:36.252 --> 24:37.722
will be on your hands.

24:38.384 --> 24:39.895
Can you live with that?

24:41.463 --> 24:43.531
It's not too late to do the right thing.

24:47.796 --> 24:50.534
Tess blames the Bureau of Land Management.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.777
They've been carving up
our properties for decades.

24:52.831 --> 24:54.784
Their headquarters are here in Manhattan.

24:54.819 --> 24:56.968
The federal building on 57th.

24:57.255 --> 24:59.792
That's what she and the
other farmers are gonna hit.

25:00.350 --> 25:01.629
I'm sure of it.

25:01.685 --> 25:02.807
Thank you.

25:05.506 --> 25:08.575
(sirens)

25:10.020 --> 25:11.921
(people clamoring)

25:12.148 --> 25:13.027
Go!

25:13.989 --> 25:15.006
We're evacuating the building,

25:15.041 --> 25:16.467
but getting 50 floors of people out of here

25:16.509 --> 25:17.902
- takes time.
- I've got it.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.619
- Where's the bomb squad?
- They're doing a sweep.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.205
So far, nothing, but, you know,

25:21.240 --> 25:23.440
they've got a lot of ground to
cover and not enough agents yet.

25:23.494 --> 25:24.882
We'll help you with evacuation.

25:24.936 --> 25:27.373
Guys, I want you to set
up a perimeter outside.

25:27.408 --> 25:28.368
Go.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.840
Tasha, Reade, you three,
search down the street

25:30.875 --> 25:33.595
to the underground parking lot. Go.

25:33.673 --> 25:35.866
Service hallways... how many? Where?

25:35.921 --> 25:37.507
One on the west side and one on the east.

25:37.570 --> 25:38.615
Both go to loading docks.

25:38.682 --> 25:40.583
- Okay. Jane, with me.
- Copy.

25:40.684 --> 25:42.111
I'll take the east side. Stay on comms.

25:42.146 --> 25:43.758
- Let me know if you see anything.
- Got it.

25:45.388 --> 25:47.639
- (Patterson) <i>Guys, we have a problem.</i>
- What is it?

25:47.674 --> 25:50.882
A truck just blew through three
red lights heading west down 57th,

25:50.937 --> 25:52.602
headed straight for the federal building.

25:52.637 --> 25:53.630
On it.

25:53.697 --> 25:54.923
(people clamoring)

25:54.986 --> 25:57.389
(booming)

25:57.756 --> 25:58.927
(Weller) Got eyes on it.

25:58.962 --> 26:01.089
Team, move to the street now.

26:04.252 --> 26:05.518
Stop!

26:14.477 --> 26:16.017
Stop your truck!

26:28.099 --> 26:30.000
(gunfire)

26:57.386 --> 26:59.563
Tess, freeze! Both of you!

26:59.598 --> 27:01.397
Get down on the ground, now!

27:01.918 --> 27:03.581
You're surrounded.

27:03.891 --> 27:05.425
Back off!

27:08.034 --> 27:08.948
Give me the detonator.

27:08.983 --> 27:11.787
Or what? You shoot me,

27:11.843 --> 27:14.596
I blow the truck, and we're all dead.

27:14.661 --> 27:16.022
You've gotta listen to me, Tess.

27:16.088 --> 27:18.782
- You don't understand.
- We do understand.

27:18.850 --> 27:20.253
The system does have problems,

27:20.288 --> 27:22.610
but killing innocent
people isn't the answer.

27:22.672 --> 27:25.963
This is the only way for
our voice to be heard,

27:26.030 --> 27:29.306
the only way to make things change.

27:29.437 --> 27:31.456
You're a soldier, right?

27:31.491 --> 27:35.260
So you've seen what happens when
people use violence to send a message,

27:35.295 --> 27:37.747
how many lives it destroys.

27:37.826 --> 27:40.794
That is the easy way out,

27:40.866 --> 27:43.291
and you know it.

27:43.359 --> 27:45.329
Soldiers are trained to do what's right,

27:45.410 --> 27:47.077
not what's easy.

27:52.402 --> 27:54.670
You need to give me that detonator, Tess.

28:20.291 --> 28:22.332
Hey, look,

28:22.367 --> 28:23.980
a friend of mine at the Justice Department

28:24.038 --> 28:27.729
is running down original copies of
Shepherd's redacted service record.

28:27.799 --> 28:30.255
It's a long shot, but it's something.

28:30.318 --> 28:31.783
What else can we do?

28:33.093 --> 28:35.784
Any break we can catch right now will help.

28:36.928 --> 28:38.809
I heard what happened earlier.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.157
That was a risky move you made,

28:40.214 --> 28:41.580
standing in front of the truck like that.

28:41.646 --> 28:44.067
I had to stop it before
it hurt anyone else,

28:44.634 --> 28:46.777
to get it back under control.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.755
The off-the-books
program?

28:49.861 --> 28:51.262
Or something else?

28:53.107 --> 28:54.991
It's a control freak's worst nightmare

28:55.061 --> 28:57.407
to find out that someone
else was at the wheel

28:57.442 --> 29:00.286
for the most crucial parts of their life.

29:00.358 --> 29:02.059
You think I'm a control freak?

29:03.250 --> 29:06.683
Shepherd may have once had a
say in your future, but, Kurt,

29:06.718 --> 29:07.960
don't let her drive you mad today

29:07.995 --> 29:11.042
by second-guessing your
leadership over this office.

29:11.077 --> 29:13.463
If someone else was sitting in that chair,

29:13.751 --> 29:16.170
they might have seen Agent
Boyd's program sooner.

29:17.003 --> 29:19.304
I've just been so focused on Sandstorm.

29:19.339 --> 29:21.554
And personal complications?

29:21.589 --> 29:23.064
Yeah, that's part of it.

29:24.036 --> 29:26.232
Great leaders know that it is impossible

29:26.267 --> 29:27.978
to take everything on themselves.

29:28.013 --> 29:29.346
You do that,

29:29.820 --> 29:32.791
and you really do start to lose
sight of the bigger picture.

29:33.717 --> 29:35.072
But as a leader,

29:36.206 --> 29:38.395
there are some things I can do better.

29:39.685 --> 29:41.706
You want me to stop using Omaha?

29:41.741 --> 29:45.383
Using illegal wiretaps or invading
the privacy of citizens is exactly

29:45.418 --> 29:47.145
the type of corruption
that we need to stop.

29:47.180 --> 29:51.022
Omaha could help us find Shepherd
and Borden before it's too late.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.530
What if we only use it for
that and not the tattoos?

29:54.144 --> 29:55.371
Patterson,

29:55.531 --> 29:58.113
what you've gone through,
that is unimaginable.

29:58.148 --> 30:00.566
I can understand you're frustrated,

30:00.601 --> 30:02.479
but there has to be a line.

30:02.711 --> 30:03.980
You know it.

30:04.015 --> 30:06.917
So, we will find them,
and we'll make them pay,

30:06.952 --> 30:09.542
but it can't be at the cost
of compromising yourself.

30:09.950 --> 30:11.054
Okay.

30:11.201 --> 30:14.533
- I'll disconnect Omaha from my systems.
- Thank you.

30:14.568 --> 30:16.740
But there's something you should
know before I pull the plug.

30:16.798 --> 30:18.932
- What did I just say?
- It's about Sean Clark.

30:20.751 --> 30:24.226
I ran his name through Omaha, and
I got a hit on an archived wiretap,

30:24.261 --> 30:27.236
a recorded phone
conversation from last year.

30:27.271 --> 30:29.515
(Mayfair) <i>Sean Clark,
wonderful to hear from you.</i>

30:29.550 --> 30:31.615
(Clark) <i>It's been a while,
Assistant Director Mayfair.</i>

30:31.650 --> 30:34.215
<i>- Holding things down in New York for us?
- Trying my best.</i>

30:34.250 --> 30:36.526
- Why would Mayfair and Clark be talking?
- Just listen.

30:36.561 --> 30:38.395
(Clark) <i>Look, I'm
calling about the agent</i>

30:38.430 --> 30:40.398
<i>you put up to run the DC office.</i>

30:40.459 --> 30:41.759
<i>He's the best I've got.</i>

30:41.848 --> 30:44.757
<i>I think it's a little premature
for him to be a candidate.</i>

30:44.792 --> 30:47.580
<i>He should spend some more time with
you in New York before taking over</i>

30:47.615 --> 30:48.992
<i>an office of his own.</i>

30:49.045 --> 30:50.656
<i>He's a bit raw, to be blunt.</i>

30:50.725 --> 30:53.756
<i>Well, that's one word for
it, but he gets results.</i>

30:53.791 --> 30:56.444
<i>I'm sure he does, but
if he stays in New York,</i>

30:56.479 --> 30:58.354
<i>I think he can do great things.</i>

30:58.416 --> 31:01.254
<i>All right. Your mistake is my gain.</i>

31:01.325 --> 31:02.568
<i>You'll see someday.</i>

31:02.626 --> 31:05.320
<i>I hope you're right.
Take care, Bethany.</i>

31:05.355 --> 31:07.000
She never told me that I was up for that.

31:07.035 --> 31:09.445
Maybe she didn't want to get your hopes up.

31:09.641 --> 31:12.491
Clark blocked the chance
for me to be promoted,

31:12.536 --> 31:14.165
to relocate to DC.

31:14.595 --> 31:17.495
He wasn't just talking baseball gibberish.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.167
What do you mean?

31:19.202 --> 31:22.834
He told me that I was playing for the Mets,

31:22.869 --> 31:24.429
the New York Mets,

31:24.468 --> 31:27.088
but he said I should have been a National.

31:28.036 --> 31:29.874
The Washington Nationals.

31:29.909 --> 31:32.589
He was trying to tell
me about that transfer,

31:32.649 --> 31:35.052
but he said they could never let it happen.

31:35.122 --> 31:37.523
"They" being Sandstorm?

31:37.609 --> 31:39.409
That phone call was from last year,

31:39.477 --> 31:41.845
so Shepherd wanted me to stay in New York,

31:41.913 --> 31:44.481
to be here when Jane showed up in that bag.

31:44.549 --> 31:47.251
What else does he know
about Shepherd and her plan?

31:54.792 --> 31:56.893
Uh, we still on for the gym tomorrow?

31:57.112 --> 31:59.629
Yes, and I promise I won't
sleep through my alarm this time.

31:59.767 --> 32:03.533
I'm sorry if I pushed you earlier.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.848
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

32:05.883 --> 32:08.637
No, I appreciate it. I do.

32:08.672 --> 32:10.918
For the first time in a while,
I feel like I can breathe,

32:10.953 --> 32:12.428
like I can have fun again.

32:13.710 --> 32:15.225
Who is she?

32:15.295 --> 32:16.581
- (laughing)
- It's not even like that.

32:16.616 --> 32:17.778
Well, you'd better not mess this one up.

32:17.813 --> 32:19.233
- Tasha.
- I'm serious.

32:19.268 --> 32:21.046
You deserve to be happy,

32:21.083 --> 32:23.119
so don't let anything
get in the way of that,

32:23.208 --> 32:26.404
including yourself. I know how you get.

32:27.627 --> 32:28.994
Yeah, I know.

32:29.046 --> 32:30.746
I will see you tomorrow.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.123
Good night.

32:41.156 --> 32:44.626
You were trying to tell me
about a promotion you blocked.

32:44.842 --> 32:47.711
You did that for Ellen, didn't you?

32:47.812 --> 32:51.247
You kept me from going to Washington. Why?

32:51.327 --> 32:53.436
You were supposed to be a National,

32:53.478 --> 32:56.346
but your career is with the Mets.

32:56.416 --> 32:59.608
Ellen wanted to keep me in New York.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.881
You're the face of the franchise,

33:01.916 --> 33:03.493
her star player.

33:03.932 --> 33:05.949
Why is she so invested in me?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.919
You're a Met.

33:08.482 --> 33:11.214
You have to be a Met.

33:11.960 --> 33:14.128
You don't understand.

33:14.220 --> 33:17.422
I don't. Help me understand, Sean.

33:18.889 --> 33:22.024
It's the Truman Protocol.

33:23.281 --> 33:25.441
It's everything.

33:27.245 --> 33:29.713
But no one knows.

33:30.196 --> 33:32.913
What is the Truman Protocol?

33:33.562 --> 33:35.563
Someone could be listening.

33:36.526 --> 33:38.493
Let's go to your room.

33:38.747 --> 33:40.882
We can talk privately there.

33:45.151 --> 33:46.531
Hello, Kurt.

33:55.913 --> 33:58.314
(beeping)

33:58.458 --> 33:59.649
Hey.

33:59.999 --> 34:01.168
What are you thinking for dinner tonight?

34:01.203 --> 34:04.444
You want Chinese or Indian, maybe?

34:04.506 --> 34:06.288
Why all the killing?

34:06.323 --> 34:08.203
What?

34:08.288 --> 34:10.489
Nas showed me the files.

34:10.627 --> 34:13.963
The attacks, the bodies Shepherd
has dropped over the years,

34:14.031 --> 34:17.366
all of my crimes, what's it all for?

34:18.020 --> 34:20.101
I want to understand

34:20.170 --> 34:22.338
why I'd follow someone like her.

34:22.935 --> 34:25.107
She believes the system
only serves those in power

34:25.141 --> 34:27.210
instead of the people it's supposed to.

34:28.136 --> 34:29.603
Is she wrong?

34:31.520 --> 34:34.335
Seems like the government
controls everything.

34:34.371 --> 34:37.446
Look at us, I'm... I'm stuck in this box,

34:37.521 --> 34:39.789
and you're forced to work for them.

34:40.141 --> 34:42.400
How do you know you're not brainwashed now?

34:43.954 --> 34:45.989
We're on the right side of this.

34:46.228 --> 34:48.283
Look, Shepherd's beliefs may seem noble,

34:48.318 --> 34:50.518
but she doesn't care who she hurts,

34:50.976 --> 34:52.764
and whatever feelings
that you're having for her,

34:52.827 --> 34:55.109
that's what she used to control you.

34:55.143 --> 34:58.374
She uses people, just like the government,

34:58.442 --> 35:02.311
and I help the FBI because I want to.

35:02.379 --> 35:04.363
No one is forcing me to do anything.

35:04.404 --> 35:06.211
They tell you where to go

35:06.320 --> 35:08.217
and what you're allowed to say.

35:08.448 --> 35:10.886
Every minute of your day
is spent doing something

35:10.954 --> 35:13.112
that they want you to do, I mean,

35:13.147 --> 35:16.285
when was the last time you
made a decision for yourself?

35:19.710 --> 35:20.843
(laughing)

35:21.073 --> 35:23.308
Hey, you want another drink?
I'm gonna make a drink.

35:23.776 --> 35:26.966
Your finest vodka soda.

35:27.001 --> 35:29.845
I don't drink soda, girl.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.073
I got juice, though.

35:31.108 --> 35:32.773
I could make you a screwdriver.

35:32.808 --> 35:34.663
At least there's some Vitamin C in this.

35:34.698 --> 35:36.078
Okay, nerd.

35:36.113 --> 35:38.981
- Easy.
- (laughing)

35:41.588 --> 35:44.692
You do realize I work for the FBI, right?

35:44.727 --> 35:47.123
Oh, get your cuffs out.

35:47.190 --> 35:48.812
Didn't you leave Freddy for this?

35:48.847 --> 35:51.023
I left Freddy 'cause he was out of control.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.782
This is just fun.

35:55.530 --> 35:57.798
(snorting)

35:57.968 --> 35:58.937
(laughing)

35:58.972 --> 36:00.638
You know, sometimes I look at you,

36:00.707 --> 36:02.181
and I feel like you've maybe never

36:02.249 --> 36:04.650
had a carefree day in your whole life.

36:07.518 --> 36:09.719
You gotta learn how to relax.

36:31.263 --> 36:33.898
Hey, not bad for a first-timer.

36:34.037 --> 36:35.045
Thank you.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.437
I still can't believe you have never played

36:36.487 --> 36:38.843
Skee-ball before, how
is that even possible?

36:38.878 --> 36:40.668
I know we said the past is just the past,

36:40.703 --> 36:44.162
but this is much more
mysterious than your tattoos.

36:44.197 --> 36:44.814
Well, let's just say

36:44.881 --> 36:47.817
- I had a very unusual childhood.
- Hmm.

36:51.088 --> 36:53.589
So, what will this get us?

36:53.917 --> 36:56.296
Uh, how does a brand-new

36:56.343 --> 36:58.627
- pencil eraser sound?
- Kinda boring.

36:58.695 --> 36:59.962
- (both laugh)
- What about

36:59.997 --> 37:02.278
a plastic set of vampire fangs?

37:02.313 --> 37:03.766
Better.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.284
You know, I thought I was
never gonna hear from you again.

37:07.319 --> 37:09.102
Thought maybe I'd screwed it up.

37:09.188 --> 37:12.541
No, it wasn't you. I just, uh...

37:12.905 --> 37:15.499
I needed to see things differently.

37:15.754 --> 37:17.469
Well, I'm glad you did.

37:19.926 --> 37:23.463
Um, wow. How many tickets is that?

37:23.525 --> 37:25.809
Uh, thousands. Many thousands.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.243
Are you saying we can't do it?

37:27.329 --> 37:29.318
Oh, we can do it, but that is gonna take

37:29.353 --> 37:31.277
a serious level of commitment.

37:31.312 --> 37:34.617
I'm thinking 30 or more hours of Skee-ball

37:34.652 --> 37:36.164
spread over ten or so days...

37:36.222 --> 37:38.567
- Hmm.
- ...depending on how your shot improves.

37:40.999 --> 37:43.045
But if you want to head down that path,

37:43.152 --> 37:45.142
there is no turning back.

37:45.239 --> 37:47.252
Are you sure you're ready for this?

37:48.667 --> 37:50.368
That shark is mine.

37:54.818 --> 37:56.418
(typing)

37:58.775 --> 38:00.564
(Zapata) I finally finished my paperwork.

38:00.599 --> 38:01.924
Have you had dinner yet?

38:01.992 --> 38:03.695
Uh, I ate a Go-Gurt.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.383
A what?

38:05.461 --> 38:06.632
A Go-Gurt, that's what you eat

38:06.667 --> 38:07.851
when you don't have time to eat a yogurt.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.716
It's like a tube of yogurt.

38:09.751 --> 38:10.624
Yeah, that's not dinner.

38:10.659 --> 38:12.001
Why don't we get something to eat?

38:12.036 --> 38:13.438
Uh, I can't.

38:13.473 --> 38:16.621
I'm still trying to ID
the reference numbers

38:16.656 --> 38:19.226
from Shepherd's redacted documents.

38:19.261 --> 38:20.985
Hey, are you okay?

38:21.020 --> 38:22.942
Yes. Why does everyone keep asking me that?

38:22.977 --> 38:25.891
- I'm fine.
- I think you need a break,

38:26.000 --> 38:28.050
maybe a drink or two to de-stress.

38:28.118 --> 38:30.133
You wanting me to de-stress

38:30.168 --> 38:31.520
is stressing me out.

38:31.693 --> 38:33.676
Please, I have so much work to do,

38:33.744 --> 38:35.001
and Weller wants me to do it with one hand

38:35.036 --> 38:36.996
tied behind my back,
and if we have any hope

38:37.031 --> 38:39.311
of catching Shepherd and Borden,

38:39.346 --> 38:40.994
someone's got to be
here to push the buttons

38:41.029 --> 38:45.234
because... the buttons
don't push themselves.

38:48.155 --> 38:49.246
Patterson.

39:04.265 --> 39:07.456
Today is an unfortunate day, Kurt.

39:11.156 --> 39:12.533
What have you done to him?

39:12.619 --> 39:16.655
I had to use some very powerful
medicine to get him lucid.

39:16.690 --> 39:19.055
Make sure he didn't say too much.

39:20.257 --> 39:22.099
I'm not worried.

39:22.134 --> 39:24.510
I've got to say, it's nice...

39:24.545 --> 39:27.252
to be in the same room as you again.

39:27.287 --> 39:29.067
You know, that day we met at the academy,

39:29.122 --> 39:33.895
you had so much anger inside of you

39:33.930 --> 39:36.977
but so much potential to
fight for what's right.

39:37.012 --> 39:39.185
I saw a lot of myself in you.

39:39.220 --> 39:41.576
Is that why you've been
manipulating my life?

39:42.290 --> 39:45.227
The scholarship, the job transfer,

39:45.262 --> 39:47.846
sending Jane to me with all the tattoos.

39:47.924 --> 39:49.153
What's it all for?

39:49.231 --> 39:52.497
(coughing)

39:52.602 --> 39:55.562
Kurt, you and I,

39:55.597 --> 39:56.900
we're...

39:56.935 --> 39:59.450
we're saving this country.

39:59.485 --> 40:02.938
I didn't know when I first met you that day

40:02.973 --> 40:06.901
how important you would be to all of this.

40:06.936 --> 40:10.342
When Remi and I formulated the tattoo plan,

40:10.436 --> 40:13.198
I saw an opportunity to put you in it,

40:13.282 --> 40:15.549
and it feels comforting to
know that you'll be there

40:15.584 --> 40:17.298
to help when the time comes.

40:17.333 --> 40:20.283
Why do you think that I will ever help you?

40:20.430 --> 40:22.331
Be part of your plan?

40:22.812 --> 40:26.247
We're the same, Kurt. Don't you see that?

40:26.340 --> 40:28.372
We both fight for what's right.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.922
We both hate corruption in all its forms.

40:30.957 --> 40:32.889
You've seen yourself, first-hand,

40:32.924 --> 40:36.226
that this country needs a revolution.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.441
We're on the same team here.

40:41.476 --> 40:43.641
How many more will have to die

40:43.715 --> 40:46.779
before you realize we want the same thing?

40:46.814 --> 40:50.016
No, we don't. You're a terrorist.

40:50.084 --> 40:51.752
That's what the law says.

40:51.819 --> 40:54.988
Did you ever consider the law is wrong?

40:56.755 --> 40:57.972
Hmm.

40:58.007 --> 40:59.226
(inhales deeply)

40:59.293 --> 41:04.030
Therein lies the big difference between us.

41:04.098 --> 41:06.700
You play by the rules.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.369
I believe the rules need to change.

41:11.016 --> 41:14.834
Only I know what it really means

41:14.869 --> 41:16.870
to make sacrifices

41:16.905 --> 41:19.941
for a greater cause than yourself.

41:26.011 --> 41:28.608
I'm sorry, old friend.

41:29.559 --> 41:30.492
Don't!

41:31.768 --> 41:34.512
No, it's okay. I had to.

41:34.915 --> 41:36.148
You know that.

41:36.475 --> 41:38.573
In order to protect the plan.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.267
You didn't have to do that!

41:44.757 --> 41:46.258
You needed to see that you're not

41:46.293 --> 41:48.689
the only one who's suffering here!

41:49.398 --> 41:51.332
This is hard on me, too!

41:52.002 --> 41:54.055
But it'll all be worth it.

41:58.379 --> 42:01.721
I have to go now, but we'll meet again,

42:01.756 --> 42:04.556
and you'll have no choice but to join me.

42:05.342 --> 42:06.631
No.

42:08.607 --> 42:09.698
There.

42:11.014 --> 42:12.882
You can let yourself out.

42:13.317 --> 42:15.281
It's really a shame.

42:15.736 --> 42:17.504
In another life...

42:19.417 --> 42:21.484
we could have been family.
