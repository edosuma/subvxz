He's worried about
finding the one.

00:07.157 --> 00:08.226

Me and you have entirely

Well, I hope you see me, ladies,

00:32.509 --> 00:34.713

No, but I'm, I'm--
I-- I'm... I could.

- EMMA: Yeah, why can't you
just let go?

18:51.238 --> 18:53.242
<i>DAVE:
What about you, Gata?
What are your demons?</i>

18:53.242 --> 18:55.747
Not releasing semen is my demon.

18:55.747 --> 18:57.618
<i>DAVE:
I feel like
you're filling a void.</i>

18:57.618 --> 18:59.387
This guy right here
is a deep thinker, dude.

18:59.387 --> 19:00.423
- It's not that deep.
- That's why all his songs

19:00.423 --> 19:03.295
are so, like, complex and shit,

19:03.295 --> 19:05.032
while I'm talking about,
"I really be having it."

19:05.032 --> 19:07.003
<i>DAVE: When I started rapping
is the first time I, like,</i>

19:07.003 --> 19:09.174
started getting high
'cause I just like escaped

19:09.174 --> 19:13.048
who I-- like, I'm just not,
like, naturally, like, a rapper.

19:13.048 --> 19:15.854
<i>Like, I need to, like, go
to another place to, like...</i>

19:15.854 --> 19:18.125
Dude, you got to tap out
of that David Burd.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.427
I-- Yeah, I don't know.

19:19.427 --> 19:21.031
It's like, why do I need
to escape reality?

19:21.031 --> 19:22.568
(cheering, applause)

19:22.568 --> 19:24.337
But my reality is, uh, good.
I don't know,

19:24.337 --> 19:26.909
I just think,
even when my reality is good,

19:26.909 --> 19:31.184
I think too much about what's
not perfect about that reality.

19:31.184 --> 19:33.188
<i>EMMA:
Like, why can't you
just accept it?</i>

19:33.188 --> 19:34.859
I don't know.
What-- Don't ask...

19:34.859 --> 19:36.929
- What are you doing?
- DAVE: Why can't you accept...

19:36.929 --> 19:38.500
- No, I don't want to be
on camera.
- Yeah, exactly. How do you feel?

19:38.500 --> 19:40.469
You put up a wall for no reason.

19:40.469 --> 19:42.106
Just let us love you.

19:42.106 --> 19:44.144
- You're looking for love, too.
<i>- EMMA: Will you stop?</i>

19:44.144 --> 19:46.148
- ELZ: See? See?
See how it feels?
- I don't want to be on camera.

19:46.148 --> 19:48.318
It's very invasive, isn't it?

19:48.318 --> 19:50.356
When did you get so uptight?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.360
S-- Working with Dave.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.199
ELZ:
Working with Dave. You talking
about working for Dave?

19:55.199 --> 19:58.238
I'm not working for Dave.

19:59.441 --> 20:01.044
Does-- Is this the right frame?

20:01.044 --> 20:03.717
'Cause I think it would be
more impactful in a wide.

20:03.717 --> 20:05.721
Where I'd be like,
I'm more alone.

20:05.721 --> 20:07.758
EMMA:
It's a documentary.

20:07.758 --> 20:09.762
(laughter)

20:09.762 --> 20:11.566
<i>CAROL:
He's always been like that,
his whole life.</i>

20:11.566 --> 20:13.603
<i>EMMA:
I mean, it's wildly difficult</i>

20:13.603 --> 20:15.907
working with Dave
because he is an insane person.

20:15.907 --> 20:17.811
DAVE:
I don't want this footage, Emma.

20:17.811 --> 20:19.047
(laughter)

20:19.047 --> 20:21.552
<i>MIKE:
Fuck, marry, kill. I would...</i>

20:21.552 --> 20:25.259
<i>fuck Gata, 'cause he--
I know he's a good fuck.</i>

20:25.259 --> 20:27.965
<i>- (laughter)
- Uh, I would marry you.</i>

20:27.965 --> 20:30.102
Kill Dave is probably the thing
<i>that matters the most to me.</i>

20:30.102 --> 20:31.906
<i>How do we kill Dave?</i>

20:31.906 --> 20:33.977
<i>We'll say it on the count
of three at the same time.</i>

20:33.977 --> 20:35.781
<i>One, two, three.</i>

20:35.781 --> 20:37.283
- Strangulation.
- Strangulate him with a pillow!

20:37.283 --> 20:39.187
<i>(both cheer)</i>

20:39.187 --> 20:40.657
- (laughter)
<i>- ELZ: I would...</i>

20:40.657 --> 20:43.763
- MIKE: Strangle with-- Dawg.
- (chuckles)

20:43.763 --> 20:46.468
<i>I've never worked so hard
for someone in my entire life.</i>

20:46.468 --> 20:48.338
<i>And I worked
at Outback Steakhouse.</i>

20:48.338 --> 20:50.042
<i>He is...</i>

20:50.042 --> 20:52.748
<i>the most difficult musician
I've ever worked with,</i>

20:52.748 --> 20:55.620
and I worked with a lot of
random rappers who are terrible,

20:55.620 --> 20:59.060
and this man, for some reason,
has just made life so difficult.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.931
<i>We used to take him shopping
for those action figures.</i>

21:00.931 --> 21:03.001
<i>- Oh, geez. The action figures.
- Do you remember that?</i>

21:03.001 --> 21:06.441
<i>DON:
He would go back and forth
about which one to get,</i>

21:06.441 --> 21:08.378
<i>and he would analyze
the pros and the cons...</i>

21:08.378 --> 21:09.949
<i>- CAROL: Yeah.
- ...of each one.</i>

21:09.949 --> 21:11.586
It was the, what did he call it?
<i>The no stone unturned...</i>

21:11.586 --> 21:13.723
- The "no stone unturned" method.
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

21:13.723 --> 21:15.927
<i>- No stone unturned.
- No stone unturned.</i>

21:15.927 --> 21:18.031
<i>- No stone unturned.
- Fuck that phrase.</i>

21:18.031 --> 21:19.768
<i>I got so stressed out
I had a kidney stone.</i>

21:19.768 --> 21:22.306
<i>I pissed out a stone.
A stone out of my penis.</i>

21:22.306 --> 21:24.612
<i>EMMA:
It became very clear
that to properly document</i>

21:24.612 --> 21:26.314
<i>this man looking for love,</i>

21:26.314 --> 21:28.586
<i>I had to document how this man
looks for everything.</i>

21:28.586 --> 21:30.089
<i>So I started filming
our edit sessions.</i>

21:30.089 --> 21:32.160
<i>So we're gonna have
to shave some frames</i>

21:32.160 --> 21:33.763
<i>off the ol' tail of it.</i>

21:33.763 --> 21:35.901
<i>EMMA: No one's gonna notice
a two-frame difference.</i>

21:35.901 --> 21:38.038
<i>I would notice the difference
every single time I watch it.</i>

21:38.038 --> 21:40.042
<i>- I can't watch this
and be tortured...
- Okay, hold on.</i>

21:40.042 --> 21:41.913
<i>- EMMA: Give me a sec.
- This is an editing session.</i>

21:41.913 --> 21:43.917
<i>I mean, hello,
welcome to the industry, Emma.</i>

21:43.917 --> 21:45.554
<i>- Geez Louise.
- EMMA: Fine.</i>

21:45.554 --> 21:46.789
<i>DAVE:
Did you take my cheesesteak?</i>

21:46.789 --> 21:48.726
<i>GATA:
Nah. Was it good?</i>

21:48.726 --> 21:50.329
Honestly, it was
very close to ideal.

21:50.329 --> 21:51.899
The bread just, like,
wasn't good enough.

21:51.899 --> 21:54.137
I mean, the couch is nice
and firm. It is a good couch.

21:54.137 --> 21:56.007
It's almost everything
you'd want in a couch.

21:56.007 --> 21:58.880
I will say, like, the pillows
are just, like, not quite right.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.786
- (laughter)
- ELZ: He's always been this way.

22:01.786 --> 22:04.090
<i>MIKE:
That's Dave.
He's never satisfied,</i>

22:04.090 --> 22:06.361
it's never finished,
so we're never finished.

22:06.361 --> 22:08.766
<i>ELZ:
As you fucking know,
very annoying.</i>

22:08.766 --> 22:10.871
And then he'll say,
like, one thing

22:10.871 --> 22:13.510
like, "Love you, big cat,"
and it's like...

22:13.510 --> 22:15.514
(whispers):
"You son of a bitch."

22:16.716 --> 22:18.151
Some people are afraid
of the hard work

22:18.151 --> 22:19.722
<i>and the ethic that LD has.</i>

22:19.722 --> 22:21.526
Some people are afraid
of being pushed to the limit.

22:21.526 --> 22:22.995
- It's the honest truth.
- You're growing up.

22:22.995 --> 22:24.364
I'm trying, bro.

22:24.364 --> 22:25.567
<i>So working with him
is like working</i>

22:25.567 --> 22:26.702
<i>with a young Phil Jackson.</i>

22:26.702 --> 22:28.005
<i>I can just envision that fool</i>

22:28.005 --> 22:29.107
<i>saying, "Gata!"</i>

22:29.107 --> 22:30.510
<i>Like, I can look in his eyes</i>

22:30.510 --> 22:31.879
and tell he want to bring
the best out of me.

22:31.879 --> 22:34.183
Or, like, Einstein,
because he's Jewish.

22:34.183 --> 22:35.720
(laughter)

22:35.720 --> 22:37.624
When I met him,
I thought he was a psycho,

22:37.624 --> 22:39.695
<i>because he said he was
gonna be a famous rapper</i>

22:39.695 --> 22:43.001
<i>and I was like, "What?"</i>

22:43.001 --> 22:45.206
<i>He had a vision,</i>

22:45.206 --> 22:47.343
<i>and it became a reality.</i>

22:47.343 --> 22:48.846
<i>ELZ:
I've been lucky enough</i>

22:48.846 --> 22:50.650
<i>to work with my best friend
since I was six</i>

22:50.650 --> 22:52.353
and he's changed my life, so...

22:54.725 --> 22:58.232
He's the closest male figure
I've got.

22:58.232 --> 23:00.570
And my dad never, you know...

23:00.570 --> 23:03.543
I believe in Dave
so fucking much it's ridiculous.

23:03.543 --> 23:06.114
<i>- EMMA: Will you ever be
satisfied?
- DAVE: Probably not.</i>

23:06.114 --> 23:07.517
At the end of the day,
I'm gonna need something

23:07.517 --> 23:08.519
other than, like,
musical success

23:08.519 --> 23:10.256
<i>to satisfy me.</i>

23:10.256 --> 23:12.694
- EMMA: Like what?
- Like love.

23:12.694 --> 23:14.430
<i>DAVE:
I believe in the truest form
of love.</i>

23:14.430 --> 23:17.738
<i>Someone's got to come along
and save me from this, like,</i>

23:17.738 --> 23:19.541
self-fulfilling prophecy I'm in.

23:19.541 --> 23:21.779
<i>EMMA:
How will you know it's her?</i>

23:21.779 --> 23:23.282
When I meet my dream girl,

23:23.282 --> 23:24.551
boy, oh, boy,
will it be evident.

23:24.551 --> 23:26.555
It's like, I will know early on.

23:26.555 --> 23:28.058
<i>It's not the type of thing</i>

23:28.058 --> 23:29.862
<i>that you need to take time
to figure out.</i>

23:29.862 --> 23:32.099
<i>I'm just, like, not gonna
get into a relationship</i>

23:32.099 --> 23:34.672
<i>and then, like, let it
slowly develop and, like...</i>

23:34.672 --> 23:36.709
<i>If I'm not blown away,
it's not good enough,</i>

23:36.709 --> 23:38.045
and I'm not gonna settle, so...

23:38.045 --> 23:39.915
<i>EMMA:
So, how many stones</i>

23:39.915 --> 23:42.186
<i>are you gonna turn over
to find her?</i>

23:44.290 --> 23:48.065
<i>I'll turn over every goddamn
stone in the world.</i>

23:48.065 --> 23:51.505
<i>I'll turn over every
goddamn stone in the world.</i>

23:51.505 --> 23:54.444
<i>Is this the only
possible ending?</i>

23:56.181 --> 23:58.218
(cheering, applause)

23:58.218 --> 24:00.122
(whooping, whistling)

24:18.559 --> 24:19.728
ROBYN:
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

24:19.728 --> 24:21.632
- DAVE: Okay.
- EMMA: Hey, you guys.

24:25.439 --> 24:27.811
Hi. Wow.

24:27.811 --> 24:30.617
- EMMA: Yeah?
- Did not see that coming at all.

24:30.617 --> 24:33.155
So, like, what, all those
editing sessions, like,

24:33.155 --> 24:36.027
they weren't even real, it was,
like, all a total charade?

24:36.027 --> 24:37.931
I mean, it was very real.

24:37.931 --> 24:39.902
Just not what
you were expecting.

24:39.902 --> 24:43.676
I got to be honest,
I do feel manipulated.

24:43.676 --> 24:46.214
But in the most
artistic way possible.

24:46.214 --> 24:47.851
Well, I learned from the best.

24:47.851 --> 24:49.855
- I'm, like, blown away.
- (laughs softly)

24:49.855 --> 24:51.592
I don't even have
that many comments or notes.

24:51.592 --> 24:53.161
Like, obviously, there's
a few things we have to do

24:53.161 --> 24:54.898
- before it goes,
like, fully public...
- Oh, Dave.

24:54.898 --> 24:57.470
This isn't our thing.

24:57.470 --> 24:58.906
It's mine.

24:58.906 --> 25:01.645
I'm not compromising
my vision for anything.

25:02.581 --> 25:04.217
Are you being serious?

25:04.217 --> 25:07.023
It's, like, the "Lil Dicky
Looking for Love" documentary.

25:07.023 --> 25:08.760
- I literally hired you and br...
- You didn't hire me.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.997
You didn't pay me.

25:10.997 --> 25:14.237
You really want to do this?
You want to play this game?

25:14.237 --> 25:17.243
Okay, all that hidden footage
type of stuff

25:17.243 --> 25:18.646
that I never consented to,

25:18.646 --> 25:20.683
can't use it, sorry,
never gave my permission.

25:20.683 --> 25:22.587
No, there were those fliers
all around.

25:22.587 --> 25:24.190
So, sorry.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.227
There will be no more notes.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.831
You're out of stones.

25:27.831 --> 25:29.200
BINIAM:
Emma?

25:29.200 --> 25:31.371
- Yeah? Hi.
- I'm Biniam.

25:31.371 --> 25:33.442
BINIAM:
Uh, Mike invited me.
I work at A24.

25:33.442 --> 25:36.381
- EMMA: Hi.
- Man, that last scene...

25:36.381 --> 25:38.886
It's pretty fucking wild, but...

25:38.886 --> 25:40.590
I mean, I got to give
her credit, though.

25:40.590 --> 25:43.730
She did have this whole fucking
vision and she just got it.

25:43.730 --> 25:48.004
You know? And I certainly
can't knock that, but...

25:49.140 --> 25:50.543
You okay?

25:50.543 --> 25:53.950
No. I feel pretty dumb.

25:53.950 --> 25:56.287
- You feel dumb?
- I just watched 90 minutes

25:56.287 --> 25:58.024
of you "looking for love,"

25:58.024 --> 26:02.266
and I was nowhere
in sight, so...

26:02.266 --> 26:04.905
Are you still looking?

26:04.905 --> 26:09.247
Am I not the result
that you wanted?

26:09.247 --> 26:10.950
No.

26:10.950 --> 26:13.623
I mean, yes.

26:13.623 --> 26:15.125
Or...

26:15.125 --> 26:17.764
Well, Emma went so rogue
on the whole thing,

26:17.764 --> 26:20.335
like, it's hard to pin
this on me.

26:20.335 --> 26:21.939
Yeah, sure is.

26:21.939 --> 26:23.843
What about all the stuff
that you said on camera?

26:23.843 --> 26:25.914
Y-You talked at length
about how,

26:25.914 --> 26:27.684
when you met the right person,
that you were

26:27.684 --> 26:29.320
just gonna immediately know
right away.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.561
Like, when did you say that?

26:32.561 --> 26:34.865
- The...
- Look, it doesn't matter when
I said that, independent of

26:34.865 --> 26:37.002
if it was before you
or after you or, like...

26:37.002 --> 26:39.207
I have been basing my philosophy
and idea of love

26:39.207 --> 26:41.411
on this, like,
truly childlike belief

26:41.411 --> 26:44.083
that love comes in
and sweeps you off your feet

26:44.083 --> 26:45.920
in a way where you know
right when it happens,

26:45.920 --> 26:47.958
and that's just not the way
the world works,

26:47.958 --> 26:50.329
- and that's okay.
- I don't want to be,

26:50.329 --> 26:53.034
this, like,
sad fucking version of that.

26:53.034 --> 26:55.038
I don't want to be
the understudy

26:55.038 --> 26:57.644
to this, like, grand version
of love that you want.

26:57.644 --> 26:59.247
I don't want to be
the sad reality.

26:59.247 --> 27:01.217
I want to be the thing
that excites you.

27:01.217 --> 27:03.355
You do excite me.
It's like, that's not...

27:03.355 --> 27:05.727
Look, I'm on
the Looking for Love tour,

27:05.727 --> 27:07.263
shooting a Looking for Love documentary.

27:07.263 --> 27:09.200
During that whole shooting,
I'm gonna be a guy

27:09.200 --> 27:11.705
that more or less is, like,
endlessly looking for love.

27:11.705 --> 27:14.711
- That's my image at this point.
- Dave, it's not your image, though.

27:14.711 --> 27:17.651
Okay? It's not your image,
it's just you.

27:17.651 --> 27:21.191
You are perpetually
looking for love,

27:21.191 --> 27:23.930
but you don't actually
want to find it.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.199
Not true.

27:25.199 --> 27:26.902
- That's not...
- Maybe if I was Rachel McAdams,

27:26.902 --> 27:28.773
I would've made your movie.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.844
Maybe I, like--
Y-You had no problem

27:30.844 --> 27:32.781
writing a whole love song
about her.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.183
And yeah, I heard it.

27:34.183 --> 27:35.854
I'm sorry that
I'm a human being with ears.

27:35.854 --> 27:37.156
I heard the song.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.360
I'm sorry you heard that
out of context.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.834
But like, that song
doesn't mean anything.

27:42.834 --> 27:46.174
Like the one
that you wrote for me?

27:47.711 --> 27:49.748
N-No. Not like that.

27:49.748 --> 27:53.421
Dave, I am here,
I'm in your house,

27:53.421 --> 27:55.560
I...

27:55.560 --> 27:59.300
I'm thinking that we're,
you know, like...

27:59.300 --> 28:01.004
falling in love.

28:01.004 --> 28:03.141
And I feel like an idiot.

28:03.141 --> 28:05.713
- You're not an idiot.
- I feel really fucking stupid.

28:05.713 --> 28:07.951
- You're not stupid.
You're not doing anything...
- Like, what am I doing out here?

28:07.951 --> 28:09.955
- What am I doing out here?
- I can't... Stop.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.894
I think things are trending
so well between us,

28:12.894 --> 28:14.130
- towards a serious...
- "Trending well"?

28:14.130 --> 28:16.000
Do you hear yourself?
"Trending well"?

28:16.000 --> 28:19.541
How much data do you need
to decide that I am worthy?

28:19.541 --> 28:23.315
It's crazy, for someone who,
like, builds an entire career

28:23.315 --> 28:25.285
off of, like,
making fun of his own flaws,

28:25.285 --> 28:30.429
you expect everyone else
to be perfect.

28:32.299 --> 28:35.105
Work that out with yourself.
(scoffs)

28:38.278 --> 28:39.648
It's...

28:39.648 --> 28:42.386
I don't expect perfection.
I know that nobody's perfect.

28:42.386 --> 28:45.058
I understand that, but, like,
just like everything in my life,

28:45.058 --> 28:46.896
I have such high expectations

28:46.896 --> 28:48.699
and I try to have
the highest level of achievement

28:48.699 --> 28:50.570
- at all times,
so when I'm talking about...
- Oh, my God.

28:50.570 --> 28:53.308
Women are not achievements,
Dave. We're not achievements.

28:53.308 --> 28:54.477
It's... (laughs)

28:54.477 --> 28:56.014
You talk so much shit

28:56.014 --> 28:59.153
about Gata being this,
like, misogynistic fuck,

28:59.153 --> 29:01.992
but you're actually just as bad.

29:01.992 --> 29:05.432
You're just lying to yourself
and to everyone else.

29:05.432 --> 29:07.403
Uh, what do you-- uh,
I don't know, what do you--

29:07.403 --> 29:10.008
uh, what am I supposed to say?
Like, I-I lo... I...

29:10.008 --> 29:13.348
I'm not upset
that you don't love me, okay?

29:13.348 --> 29:17.056
I'm just sad,

29:17.056 --> 29:18.626
because I'm pretty sure you do,

29:18.626 --> 29:23.168
but you won't commit
until you are 100% certain

29:23.168 --> 29:27.076
that I am the absolute best
that you can do.

29:29.915 --> 29:32.286
That has nothing to do with me.

29:32.286 --> 29:33.789
(laughs softly)

29:34.558 --> 29:36.528
So I'm gonna go.

29:36.528 --> 29:38.031
(stammers)

29:38.031 --> 29:40.402
- Please don't.
- Um...

29:40.402 --> 29:43.174
You're a famous rapper.
(laughs softly)

29:43.174 --> 29:48.753
So I'm sure your dream girl
will just show up.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.590
Robyn.

29:50.590 --> 29:53.295
I didn't have any control
over that documentary.

29:53.295 --> 29:55.933
Like, it was not
my vision at all.

29:55.933 --> 29:58.639
I'm not your vision, either, Dave.

29:58.639 --> 30:00.510
No one is.

30:00.510 --> 30:03.014
