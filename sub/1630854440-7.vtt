WEBVTT

00:15.391 --> 00:16.475
Excuse me.

00:16.475 --> 00:18.519
I think there's something wrong
with my badge.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.397
I'm Ravi Patel.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.441
Drive long-haul.
That's my truck back there.

00:23.441 --> 00:24.650
Well, well, well.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.111
Look who decided to show up to work.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.697
â™ªPaige Boss life is hard,

00:29.697 --> 00:32.825
especially when you're dealing
with bad employees.

00:32.825 --> 00:35.578
But you just got to girl up and do it.

00:35.578 --> 00:36.871
Mr. Stewart, Ms. Stewart,

00:36.871 --> 00:38.205
- I was just telling the...
- You haven't been in here

00:38.205 --> 00:39.749
for two days.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.126
My mother died. I filed for leave.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.170
We received no request.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.588
You need to exit our property.

00:45.588 --> 00:49.383
No, I need this job. It's Christmas.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.093
Please, just let me get back on the road.

00:51.093 --> 00:54.263
Your job was to drive
and you didn't drive.

00:54.263 --> 00:56.932
I was only away at my mother's funeral.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.643
Okay. Fine.

01:00.352 --> 01:02.354
I'll just get my truck
and be out of your way.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.985
You own nothing.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.697
The rig we let you borrow
has already been given to another guy

01:11.697 --> 01:14.408
who actually read his contract.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.079
Wait! Wait!

01:21.707 --> 01:26.128
To all my Paige Bosses out there,
Merry Christmas.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.006
Stop! Get out of the shot!

01:29.006 --> 01:30.299
I have to do it over now!

01:53.906 --> 01:56.033
I come to this country
a few years ago,

01:56.033 --> 01:58.452
worked odd jobs,
trying to piece together a living.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.205
Then I saw an ad
for Good Stewart Trucking.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.581
No experience needed.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.292
They said I could be my own boss,
own my truck.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.836
 So, you signed on?

02:06.836 --> 02:09.088
 The first two weeks,
I went 14-hour days.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.589
No days off.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.300
But instead of a paycheck,
I received a bill,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.636
between fuel, maintenance,
and leasing fees.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.430
I owed the company $150.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.099
Why didn't you just walk away?

02:20.099 --> 02:21.725
I didn't think I could.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.686
I signed all these contracts.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.479
So, I upped my hours, slept in my car.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.400
I took two days off
for my mother's funeral.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.444
And they repossessed my truck.

02:32.444 --> 02:36.657
I've paid $50,000 into it,
and now it's all gone.

02:38.409 --> 02:40.494
That truck was my family's future.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.746
And they just took it.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.124
That's not right.

02:51.630 --> 02:53.007
 Somehow
I didn't get that message.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.134
I thought we were going on a vacation.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.802
We are.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.722
This job is not gonna take long.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.515
- Parker.
- Hmm?

03:01.515 --> 03:06.270
Christmas while in our hearts
year round is also a finite period of time

03:06.270 --> 03:09.690
where heightened festivity
levels are most appropriate

03:09.690 --> 03:11.150
or so I've been told.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.694
So, if we're going to be here
longer than expected,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.154
then I'm not gonna waste a single minute.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.448
 When I said that
about your Christmas jumper,

03:17.448 --> 03:20.200
it was July, in New Orleans.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.911
 Breanna, I need more snowflakes.

03:21.911 --> 03:24.538
Okay, so, I am gonna return
the snowboard.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.623
- You snowboard?
- No.

03:25.623 --> 03:27.708
It's my daughter's senior class ski trip.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.543
I thought I'd be the cool dad and go,

03:29.543 --> 03:32.755
but I just wanted to sprain my ankle
and relax by the fire, really.

03:32.755 --> 03:36.759
Look, we're still going on holiday.
We're just postponing a few days.

03:36.759 --> 03:38.677
- Got it, thanks.
- Well, Good Stewart Trucking

03:38.677 --> 03:40.262
is a piece of work.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.390
I mean, I wish I could say
they were breaking the law,

03:43.390 --> 03:48.312
but this lease operator model
has kind of become industry standard.

03:48.312 --> 03:52.107
Companies are luring in drivers
with promises of no money down,

03:52.107 --> 03:54.276
and big earning potential.

03:54.276 --> 03:57.029
Like this is from
Good Stewart's onboarding manual.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.990
This graph is supposed to show
the uber bucks that can be made

03:59.990 --> 04:01.241
when you lease to own a truck.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.786
But I did my own calculations

04:03.786 --> 04:07.581
and this is what their drivers' pay
actually would look like.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.999
Total lie.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.627
To have more people sign
the predatory contracts.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.213
And they call them
contractors instead of employees.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.881
So, normal labor laws don't apply.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.550
And if they quit, they are liable
for the full cost of the truck

04:18.550 --> 04:20.052
- and any back fees.
- Yup.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.971
So, I went ahead and told Nana
that me and Parker

04:21.971 --> 04:24.098
were gonna be a little late
for Christmas this year.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.474
She's sending pie
to tide us over.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.184
Not for you, Eliot. Uh-uh.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.477
She said you're welcome to join.

04:28.477 --> 04:32.231
- The more, the merrier.
- Thank you. But I have plans.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.984
Who's responsible for taking
Ravi's truck, Breanna?

04:34.984 --> 04:37.444
Well, not Nick Stewart.
I mean, that's the company's founder.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.573
Nick's business model,
the driver first idea,

04:41.573 --> 04:44.243
that was the standard
that companies aspire to.

04:44.243 --> 04:47.329
I mean, it's competitive pay,
lovely work environment,

04:47.329 --> 04:48.956
and he had a big thing for giving back.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.332
They did a toy drive every year.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.543
He really leaned
into the whole Santa vibe, huh?

04:52.543 --> 04:55.004
Truck drivers
are basically Santa,

04:55.004 --> 04:59.258
except they handle the logistical problems
of transnational shipping without elves.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.219
However, last year, after Nick passed,

05:02.219 --> 05:04.555
his kids, Luke and Paige, they took over.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.641
So, Luke runs the loading docks,
and Paige has the office.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.892
She makes most of the decisions.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.770
Under her, their turnover
has gone from best to worst.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.690
They're doing this to dozens of people.
It's not just Ravi.

05:14.690 --> 05:17.943
Okay. So, we have a couple of scrooges

05:17.943 --> 05:20.946
who are bleeding
their father's legacy for profit.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.073
I think I'd like to meet them.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.491
Yeah. You and me both.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.077
Good Stewart is hiring seasonal employees.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.329
Good. Breanna, you get us in and Harry--

05:29.329 --> 05:31.498
I'm gonna dig into these contracts
a little bit more,

05:31.498 --> 05:33.417
find a loophole,
and return a snowboard.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.754
No one is returning any snowboards.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.465
We're just--we're gonna investigate
Good Stewart Trucking.

05:39.465 --> 05:44.178
We're gonna get Ravi his truck back,
and we're all going on holiday.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.472
What kind of pies is Nana sending?

05:46.472 --> 05:49.141
- All of them, I think.
- I didn't get any of them last year.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.977
- You left early.
- That's not the point.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.774
Oh.

05:59.026 --> 05:59.985
Oh.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.529
Guys?

06:06.325 --> 06:08.827
THREE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS

06:10.204 --> 06:12.539
I thought flannel
was supposed to be comfortable.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.710
I said I was sorry.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.587
And I said I had dibs on the sweet potato,

06:18.587 --> 06:21.965
that is ironclad, that's sacred.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.051
- <i>Breanna?</i>
- Yeah.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.137
Sorry. There's not a lot
of silk worn by dispatchers.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.847
And that's about as close
as I can get you to Paige.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.140
<i>Do you have a plan?</i>

06:30.140 --> 06:33.102
Make Paige my new best friend,
discover all her secrets,

06:33.102 --> 06:35.604
destroy her from the inside,

06:35.604 --> 06:39.650
and get you to Nana's in time
for carol and nog.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.819
<i>The Sophie Devereaux special.</i>

06:41.819 --> 06:43.779
<i>Eliot, any sign of Luke?</i>

06:44.863 --> 06:46.532
You're 15 minutes late.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.574
So, I'm docking your pay.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.077
That's bull. Aren't I entitled to a break?

06:50.077 --> 06:52.204
Don't you have another delivery?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.206
I got him.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.792
Looks like he keeps
a few dogs with him on a leash.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.172
And I've got her.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.178
And that's why I always rally.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.140
Because that is the #PaigeBossway.

07:11.140 --> 07:14.017
Because when life throws you lemons,

07:14.017 --> 07:15.769
you just got to pivot

07:15.769 --> 07:18.438
or else those lemons
are gonna squash you in the face.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.150
Paige has quite the social media setup.

07:21.150 --> 07:24.570
Ooh, she also has an early
Christmas present for Parker.

07:24.570 --> 07:25.696
There's a floor safe.

07:25.696 --> 07:29.158
- Hmm.
- So, I'm on Paige's socials right now.

07:29.158 --> 07:33.412
She's trying to make #PaigeBoss happen
and it is not going well.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.706
She has, like, 36 followers.

07:35.706 --> 07:39.084
I didn't know it was possible
for the algorithm to hate you so much.

07:39.084 --> 07:43.338
And I refuse to be
a squashed lemon.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.884
So, today, I'm gonna show you--oh, my God.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.135
You are in my eye line.

07:48.135 --> 07:51.513
No, no, no, please.
Don't stop. That was so good.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.598
Janice.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.559
Who are you? What do you want?

07:55.559 --> 07:57.186
I'm Sam Travers.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.148
I just got hired in dispatch.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.901
Oh, ma'am, you are so inspiring.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.360
What is it, Paige?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.612
Ms. Stewart.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.698
Can you take this dispatcher
to where she belongs?

08:10.616 --> 08:11.742
Well, come on.

08:11.742 --> 08:14.703
There's no dilly-dally
when it comes to dispatch.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.205
Yes, ma'am.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.168
First day, you already learned
your first lesson.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.878
Don't bother the Stewarts.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.714
All right.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.091
Your world is here.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.722
Merry, merry, driver, go for company?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.183
Mind your yardsticks.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.061
You got overturned doubles
blocking 12th Street to 65.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.188
<i>That's a 10-4, thank you.</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:45.192
From your expression, I can tell you
didn't understand a word of that.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.027
I didn't.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.696
But how about I make us a cup of coffee
and you and I can...

08:49.696 --> 08:52.366
No way, Jose. We start now.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.869
I'm gonna tie myself
to your side until you learn this job.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.329
<i>...calling dispatch, over?</i>

08:57.329 --> 08:58.789
Merry, merry, driver?

08:58.789 --> 09:02.292
Getting face time with Paige
may be a little trickier than I thought.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.339
Let me help you with that.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.174
Oh, thanks.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.552
Hey, was that the boss man
you were talking to earlier?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.680
Yeah. Yeah, something new.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.974
Last guy who stood up to Luke
and his thugs

09:16.974 --> 09:18.642
limped out of here without a job.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.477
I can handle a little yelling.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.021
Right. Well, tell you what,
why don't you take a break.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.232
- Huh?
- Go get yourself a cup of coffee.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.984
I'll load the rest of this stuff.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.652
We got to have each other's back
around here.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.946
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'll take it.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.499
Hey. Why is my business credit cards
being declined?

09:42.499 --> 09:45.711
Um, because you used it
for non-business expenses.

09:45.711 --> 09:46.837
Duh.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.882
Oh, amazing.

09:50.882 --> 09:55.053
Okay. Are you gonna try to tell me that
whatever this is, is business related?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.722
Um, excuse me.

09:56.722 --> 10:02.019
They are beautiful designer handbags
and they <i>are</i> my business.

10:02.019 --> 10:06.064
I am building my brand.
This is the first merchandise.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.608
I need you to take this crate

10:08.608 --> 10:11.570
and store it in the trailer
at the end of the docks.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.615
I need to promo these immediately.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.909
- You're ridiculous.
- No.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.829
What I am is pursuing my dream.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.915
- Oh, my God.
- I have worked very hard

10:23.915 --> 10:26.585
to make us look good
to YDN Trucking on paper.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.129
You do the same with the docks.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.674
Once we pass inspection,
you can take your half and do whatever.

10:33.342 --> 10:37.220
And I'm free to build
a company more... me.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.475
Hey, end of the docks.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.313
All right. YDN Trucking.
Everybody catch that?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.981
Loud and clear, good buddy.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.775
YDN is a national trucking company.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.985
They buy smaller companies
just to gut them.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.613
Paige and Luke are cashing in.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.407
And if they do, everyone here
will be out of a job.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.160
And Ravi will never get his truck back.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.005
YDN Trucking is an industry behemoth.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.926
They buy up local companies
just to acquire their shipping contracts.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.889
Oh. Woah-ho-ho.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.558
I need more lights.

11:23.558 --> 11:28.355
Again, Parker, we are not
gonna be here for Christmas.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.524
I looked right at it.
I looked right at it.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.150
Okay. The, uh, somewhat good news

11:32.150 --> 11:34.569
is that Ravi may have a case
for a class-action suit,

11:34.569 --> 11:37.406
which would take about three years
if he could find enough other drivers.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.783
Paige and Luke will be long gone
with YDN's money by then.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.410
That's why I said, "Somewhat good news."

11:41.410 --> 11:44.496
So, first things first,
we need to spike this sale.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.206
- Breanna?
- Okay. So, trucking companies,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.583
they live and die by their O, S,
and D numbers.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.460
It stands for over, short, and damage.

11:50.460 --> 11:53.213
So, when a shipment gets lost or damaged,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.924
the shipper can file a claim
and the company is held liable.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.552
Plus, the shipper's probably gonna
drop them and find another company.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.762
If we can make it seem like
Good Stewart's contracts

12:00.762 --> 12:03.056
are on the verge of canceling,
then YDN will walk away.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.308
Yes. A rep from YDN

12:05.308 --> 12:07.686
is scheduled to do a final walkthrough
for the company tomorrow.

12:07.686 --> 12:11.648
Let's make this company look like
the biggest mess YDN's ever seen.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.901
Well, I've been doing a little snooping
around Good Stewart's financials,

12:14.901 --> 12:16.528
and one thing stuck out. Breanna?

12:16.528 --> 12:19.239
Those trucks that are leased
are actually paid off in full.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.284
So, the fees that the drivers are paying
are going straight to Paige and Luke.

12:22.284 --> 12:26.204
All right. Well, looking at this,
the company barely makes a profit.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.123
And who wants to bet
they have a second set of books

12:28.123 --> 12:29.124
with their real numbers in it.

12:29.124 --> 12:31.793
And that those books are in that
yummy floor safe in Paige's office.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.795
Well, we got to get you
into that safe.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.547
Now how are we gonna distract Paige?

12:35.547 --> 12:39.551
Hmm, Breanna's gonna give Paige
a little Christmas bonus.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.888
Listen up, Paige Bosses.

12:42.888 --> 12:47.642
No spoilers, but today is the biggest
meeting of my professional life.

12:47.642 --> 12:52.147
One that sets the stage for a huge change
in this Paige Boss' life.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.990
Oh, my God.

13:02.574 --> 13:03.575
Oh, my God.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.578
I have gone viral.

13:08.330 --> 13:12.792
Uh, social media bots,
the gift that keeps on giving.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.085
What are you doing?

13:14.085 --> 13:15.378
Don't move anything.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.131
Everything here has been
double-checked for inspection.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.134
You ready?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.719
This is the fun part.

13:26.681 --> 13:27.516
Hello.

13:27.516 --> 13:31.102
<i>This is Debbie Sumner
from HWIC Productions.</i>

13:31.102 --> 13:32.354
HWIC?

13:32.354 --> 13:34.356
Head Women in Charge? The reality show?

13:34.356 --> 13:36.358
<i>Yeah.
So, we're producing a new season.</i>

13:36.358 --> 13:38.985
<i>And I just had an entrepreneur
drop out last minute.</i>

13:38.985 --> 13:42.072
Anyway, someone put your latest
poster in front of me,

13:42.072 --> 13:44.032
and you might be the person
we're looking for.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.077
I totally am.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.329
Great. So, I'm sending
a couple of producers over.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.789
They'll take some initial video.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.123
Do some interviews.

13:52.123 --> 13:53.875
And I'll take a look at it. Talk soon.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.919
Oh, today? I have a really big meeting.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.587
What are you doing?

13:57.587 --> 14:00.674
- Nothing.
- But you were talking on your phone.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.842
You were supposed to be
watching the scanner.

14:02.842 --> 14:06.513
When you're in that chair,
you are the driver's eyes and ears.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.473
You get them home safe.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.059
Sorry. Won't happen again.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.020
Listen.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.731
Paige and Luke might not care,

14:17.440 --> 14:20.652
but Nick had standards, and so do I.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.835
It's all happening, Paige.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.211
It's all happening.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.380
What are you doing?
The YDN rep will be here any second.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.674
You're gonna have to give
the presentation by yourself.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.843
- I've had something come up.
- Are you kidding?

14:44.843 --> 14:47.053
The data I sent YDN is foolproof.

14:49.139 --> 14:53.518
I'm thinking start wide,
panning across the dreary office sadness.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.770
All you have to do is walk
them around the dock, okay? Go.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.815
And we land on our st--

14:58.815 --> 15:01.067
No. Where can I find Paige Stewart?

15:01.067 --> 15:03.111
Hi. I'm Paige.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.529
Of course.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.990
I'm Jamie. And this is Jamie.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.118
And we've heard all the jokes
and we're from Head Woman in Charge.

15:10.118 --> 15:14.247
Yes. I am so inspired by your show.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.541
It's not a show. It's a movement.

15:16.541 --> 15:20.086
It's a first stop for every woman
on her way to world domination.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.630
The camera loves your cheekbones.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.758
Let's see how she does
under the lights, shall we?

15:24.758 --> 15:26.718
Yes, of course. Follow me.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.098
Mr. Stewart,
wasn't your sister supposed to join us?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.475
Oh, she'll be here in a bit.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.684
Are you sure?

15:34.684 --> 15:37.062
I warn you,
it's my job to be very thorough

15:37.062 --> 15:39.022
during these pre-acquisition inspections.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.523
We've got nothing to hide.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.402
Oh, look.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.280
I've got Good Stewart's logistics info.

15:48.239 --> 15:53.161
Oh, we don't need that line,
or that, or that one, or this one.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.872
Bye.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.668
The reality space
is saturated with trucking.

15:59.668 --> 16:02.003
What makes you stand out?

16:02.003 --> 16:05.965
I am not going to be running
a trucking company forever.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.135
My brother and I inherited
Good Stewart from our father.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.721
It was a total mess when we took over.

16:11.721 --> 16:15.308
Dad apparently cared way more
about his employees than his bottom line.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.643
Why would he do that?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.269
I didn't know him very well.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.313
My parents split when we were kids.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.607
Whenever we saw him,
he always wanted to do something lame,

16:22.607 --> 16:25.068
like, deliver toys to orphans.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.447
Or spend quality time together.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.740
Trucking was his thing.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.411
Mine... is handbags.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.122
Well, the world needs more handbags.

16:37.122 --> 16:39.124
- Confessionals!
- What?

16:39.124 --> 16:41.292
The lifeblood of every
reality show are the deep,

16:41.292 --> 16:44.754
dark confessions of their stars,
the real juicy stuff.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.297
Let's rearrange this setup.

16:46.297 --> 16:47.424
Whoa!

16:47.966 --> 16:49.759
Okay.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.220
I'm noticing quite a few
damages and missing shipments.

16:52.220 --> 16:53.722
Oh, are you sure?

17:05.066 --> 17:07.652
That was an--an aberration.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.029
I mean, our--
our OSD numbers are minimal, so.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.281
Oh.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.534
No. No. That's not.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.723
Oh, I--I can't see anything.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.099
That's the entire point.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.518
Block out the rest of the world.
Only you matter.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.687
And we are rolling.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.982
So, tell me, what makes you an HWIC?

17:45.982 --> 17:48.610
You don't seem to have control
over your dock, Mr. Stewart.

17:52.155 --> 17:54.199
That lift size is not regulation!

17:54.199 --> 17:55.617
Hey! You!

17:55.617 --> 17:56.618
Stop!

17:56.618 --> 17:58.536
Do you even train your employees?

18:01.539 --> 18:04.542
Sorry. I--I'm gonna clean it up.
I'm gonna clean it up. Okay.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.711
I--I've never even driven
a forklift before.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.755
Can you believe it?
Mr. Stewart was nice enough

18:08.755 --> 18:10.465
to let me hop on
while I'm still in training.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.508
But I'm gonna clean it up.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.887
He's not forklift certified?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.599
I know this looks bad,
but my sister can explain the numbers.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.684
Let's go talk to your sister now.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.605
Genuine pleather is the way to go.

18:25.605 --> 18:30.902
That way, you can market it
as vegan leather and it's a 15% markup.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.237
- What was that?
- That was me,

18:32.237 --> 18:34.405
giving you props,
because you're a natural.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.912
I have never experienced
such a horrendous worksite.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.540
You see this? Lost, damaged, lost.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.999
Just in the past few days,

18:44.999 --> 18:47.168
not to mention,
this place is a death trap.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.796
- Ms. Hauser...
- Your father was a giant

18:49.796 --> 18:50.839
in this industry.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.675
And you two have run this
company into the ground.

18:53.675 --> 18:56.636
I am positive,
what contracts you do have left,

18:56.636 --> 18:59.055
we'll be canceling after the holiday rush.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.975
YDN is no longer interested.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.101
But...

19:06.688 --> 19:08.064
Think we have all we need.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.066
Don't call us. We'll call you.

19:15.905 --> 19:19.617
- What did you do?
- Me?

19:19.617 --> 19:22.036
Well, you, you bailed on the inspection.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.415
Well, I guess she wasn't
HWIC material after all.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.263
Well, I guess that sale
you were banking on ain't happening.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.557
Big Jim is not gonna be happy.

19:52.734 --> 19:55.612
ONE DAY UNTIL CHRISTMAS

19:56.738 --> 19:59.991
So, the books are showing several regular
anonymous shipments,

19:59.991 --> 20:03.453
ingoing and outgoing that don't match
with what's on the original manifest.

20:03.453 --> 20:06.080
- So... they're smuggling something.
- They're smuggling.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.374
If Luke and Paige
are moving illicit goods,

20:08.374 --> 20:10.293
we can just have them arrested.
Bye-bye, right?

20:10.293 --> 20:12.211
If we can find out what the shipments are.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.131
But dispatch sees everything
so I can work Janice for insight.

20:15.131 --> 20:16.925
You and Eliot are on the docks.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.385
Luke, um, has these two thugs
that he keeps handy.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.846
I'm wondering if they have a role
in this whole smuggling operation.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.848
That's a good question. Let's find out.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.606
All right.
I'm gonna pan here and here.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.358
We're going high and wide angles
for the opening.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.610
We wanna put cameras in the corners,
get B-roll with the workers,

20:35.610 --> 20:37.236
maybe do interviews, you know,
give it some real heart.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.279
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

20:38.279 --> 20:39.530
We are filming here, my man.

20:39.530 --> 20:42.075
Tell us, what is the best thing
about working at Good Stewart?

20:42.075 --> 20:44.243
- Hey. Hey.
- What's going on here?

20:45.203 --> 20:46.537
Jamie and Jamie?

20:46.537 --> 20:48.456
There she is. Our star.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.500
Even under these incredibly unflattering

20:50.500 --> 20:53.211
overhead fluorescent lights,
you shine like a beacon.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.547
I thought I wasn't HWIC material.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.132
So did we. But then, we showed the footage

20:58.132 --> 20:59.759
at our holiday party, you know,
the bloopers?

20:59.759 --> 21:02.095
And our boss, capital L, freaked over it.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.346
- Mm.
- She said and quote,

21:03.346 --> 21:06.265
"Show me a boss that hasn't stumbled
on her way to the top."

21:06.265 --> 21:09.477
We wanna be the witnesses
as you rise up out of the slop

21:09.477 --> 21:11.562
and wipe the crud off your body,

21:11.562 --> 21:14.649
and shine bright
like the gem you really are.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.401
- Paige, you can't be serious.
- Shush. Shush.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.653
I am a gem.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.698
This is how I get national reach.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.158
- So great. So great. Jamie?
- Yes, Jamie?

21:24.158 --> 21:26.828
What do you say we go up to Paige's office
and let her show us how like the phoenix

21:26.828 --> 21:28.371
she's gonna rise from the ashes?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.040
- Come on.
- Okay.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.626
Now, we're gonna put
cameras in this corner

21:33.626 --> 21:35.545
and this corner, and that corner.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.005
And then, over there,
and over there.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.549
That's pretty cool, man.
You're gonna be on TV.

21:39.549 --> 21:41.384
That's Paige, not us.

21:41.384 --> 21:45.096
Oh, you're still gonna be on TV.
You got to be careful, though, man.

21:45.096 --> 21:48.224
They dig up all kinds of stuff on people,
even if you're not on camera.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.060
I remember my folks had these neighbors
who did a home renovation show,

21:51.060 --> 21:52.395
they dug up everything on him.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.564
Dug up the fact that he had
dodged his taxes,

21:54.564 --> 21:56.482
dug up the fact he had
unpaid parking tickets,

21:56.482 --> 21:59.402
they even dug up our old dead dog
in the backyard.

21:59.402 --> 22:03.698
Skippy. I played with Skippy a lot.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.785
They told me
he went off to a farm upstate.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.540
You make your peace with it.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.627
Hey, Big Jim.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.379
Yeah, we got a problem.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.507
He wants to talk to you.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.387
Roger that.
Keep it at a double nickel,

22:26.387 --> 22:28.097
unless you wanna come home
with a bare butt.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.891
<i>Copy that, 10-4.</i>

22:29.891 --> 22:32.727
These drivers have been doing
this job a long time.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.146
They don't need to be reminded
to look out for cops.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.356
<i>Yeah, and rightfully so. Uh...</i>

22:37.356 --> 22:39.108
Copy that.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.944
You've been doing this job a lot, too.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.656
You probably seen everything.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.325
I've seen enough.

22:47.325 --> 22:51.037
You ever seen anything real crazy
getting shipped through?

22:51.037 --> 22:54.248
- Like what?
- Well, I've seen the TV shows,

22:54.248 --> 22:56.793
something hidden in one of them boxes,

22:56.793 --> 22:59.212
something that wasn't
supposed to be there.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.630
I don't know what you mean.

23:00.630 --> 23:03.591
- <i>This is Stewart 25.</i>
- Go for dispatch.

23:03.591 --> 23:07.553
<i>Got that Christmas present
coming in on the docks ASAP.</i>

23:09.222 --> 23:10.264
It's nothing.

23:10.264 --> 23:14.894
Um, I'm gonna take a break,
you just stick to the basics.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.358
<i>Sorry, I can't hear you on my [indistinct]</i>

23:20.358 --> 23:24.570
Janice hasn't trusted me all week,
now she's leaving me alone.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.405
Something's up.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.018
Oh.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.229
Sam, you startled me.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.398
Wait. You left dispatch unattended?

24:00.398 --> 24:04.110
Well, it seemed more important to see you
who were getting secret packages from.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.945
- What's in the box?
- Nothing.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.114
If it were nothing,
you wouldn't be hiding it.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.241
What is it? Is it drugs?

24:10.241 --> 24:11.909
- What?
- Is it smuggled goods?

24:11.909 --> 24:13.202
- No.
- I wanna see.

24:13.202 --> 24:14.745
- What...
- Okay. Fine.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.957
What?

24:23.337 --> 24:24.964
It's just toys.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.509
Toys?

24:28.509 --> 24:33.890
All I was trying to do is keep Nick's
holiday toy drive tradition alive.

24:33.890 --> 24:38.603
I mean, he delivered toys to the orphanage
every year without fail.

24:38.603 --> 24:42.398
Paige discarded it
as an unnecessary expense.

24:42.398 --> 24:46.277
So, I've been secretly
collecting donations.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.324
Nick painted that himself.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.742
You and Nick.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.244
You were close.

24:59.457 --> 25:03.628
The moment I met Nick
felt like I came home.

25:03.628 --> 25:06.589
I mean, we never put anything
down on paper,

25:06.589 --> 25:09.592
but we were happy together.

25:11.052 --> 25:14.305
And the most important thing
to Nick about this place

25:14.305 --> 25:16.390
was the people.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.017
They were his family.

25:20.228 --> 25:25.399
Now, his kids, his blood,
they wanna undo all of that,

25:25.399 --> 25:27.235
right down to ruining Christmas.

25:28.611 --> 25:30.112
Why am I telling you all this?

25:31.072 --> 25:33.115
Hey, listen.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.454
I know this woman,
she lost her husband.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.293
And she works hard to take care
of the people in her life,

25:44.293 --> 25:47.129
like you and Nick.

25:47.129 --> 25:50.424
And when you're taking
care of everybody, you--

25:50.424 --> 25:52.551
well, it's hard to let people in.

25:53.844 --> 25:56.806
So, she--she pushed them away a little.

25:57.932 --> 26:00.268
You know what they did?

26:01.769 --> 26:03.062
They kept pushing back?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.146
Hell, yeah.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.902
So, if you wanna keep Christmas
the way Nick would've wanted,

26:09.902 --> 26:11.904
you got to keep pushing.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.072
He may be gone,

26:13.072 --> 26:15.783
but what you loved about him
doesn't have to be.

26:15.783 --> 26:18.869
And Luke and Paige,
they don't get a say in that.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.254
The trick is to decrease
the number of miles

26:28.254 --> 26:31.132
that you give to the driver once they're
close to completing their lease.

26:31.132 --> 26:35.177
That way, you can milk them
for a few more weeks of fees.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.471
Oh, my God. You're so brave.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.143
- I need to talk to my sister.
- Oh, good.

26:42.143 --> 26:43.561
- We can get a nice angle...
- Oh,

26:43.561 --> 26:45.021
- that would be nice. We can get...
- ...for a double confessional.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.522
No, no! You--out!

26:46.522 --> 26:47.606
- Please get out!
- Oh.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.816
- Hey, hey. Easy, easy, buddy.
- Out now!

26:51.819 --> 26:53.904
Luke.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.615
You can't turn off my camera.
You ruined my take.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.908
We have a problem.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.453
I just spoke to Big Jim
and he is not happy.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.873
Breanna, Luke just burst in
and switched off the cameras.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.042
<i>No, he only thinks he did.</i>

27:06.042 --> 27:09.628
Silly rabbit and you didn't think
you had control over those, did you?

27:11.589 --> 27:14.717
I imagine. Since you messed up
the sale to YDN.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.719
Yeah. He's pissed about that,

27:16.719 --> 27:19.138
but Big Jim is also angry
about all the cameras

27:19.138 --> 27:20.348
that are everywhere.

27:20.348 --> 27:22.975
- Did he say Big Jim?
- Yeah. Who is that?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.895
It's Big Jim Montrose,
head of the Dixie Mafia.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.688
<i>He's not somebody you wanna play with.</i>

27:27.688 --> 27:31.192
Luke doesn't have these mullet twins
on a leash, they got him.

27:31.192 --> 27:34.528
If we wanna sell this place
and get him his money,

27:34.528 --> 27:35.988
we need the exposure.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.115
Until then, we just have to keep
moving his merchandise

27:38.115 --> 27:39.575
and keep in his good graces.

27:39.575 --> 27:42.870
We've got a big shipment of guns
sitting on the dock

27:42.870 --> 27:44.455
and you think a bunch of people
with cameras

27:44.455 --> 27:45.998
will keep us in his good graces?

27:45.998 --> 27:49.835
Dixie Mafia has a shipment of guns
on this dock right now.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.714
Breanna, check the trailers,
I'll check the docks.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.508
We're coming, too.

27:58.177 --> 28:01.806
We have to shut down the cameras
and move the guns off the dock,

28:01.806 --> 28:03.391
- Big Jim's orders.
- No!

28:03.391 --> 28:06.477
It is bad enough that you got us
into bed with Big Jim

28:06.477 --> 28:08.396
because you don't know
how to pick a horse.

28:08.396 --> 28:10.439
You are not taking this away from me.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.274
Will you forget about your brand?

28:12.274 --> 28:14.193
If we don't do this, we're dead.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.868
There's nothing here.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.247
Nothing.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.669
I've got novelty socks with bells.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.255
<i>You got anything, Breanna?</i>

28:34.255 --> 28:35.548
It's probably gonna be towards the back.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.258
What do-- what is it supposed to say?

28:37.258 --> 28:38.926
Uh, guns are in here or something?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.594
Check any large unmarked wooden crates.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.304
<i>Use your crowbar.</i>

28:42.304 --> 28:43.722
There's nothing in here like that.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.102
Fine. I'll take care of it.

28:48.102 --> 28:50.855
Just like I take care of everything.

28:50.855 --> 28:54.191
No. You deal with the reality people,
I'll take care of the guns.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.110
- Lucas Stewart...
- Stop!

28:56.110 --> 28:57.570
Trust me to do something.

29:00.489 --> 29:03.617
Uh...

29:07.705 --> 29:08.998
Luke's on the move,

29:08.998 --> 29:11.125
he'll probably lead us
straight to the guns.

29:13.127 --> 29:15.337
Now, just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

29:15.337 --> 29:17.339
These shipments are off limits.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.428
Here you go.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.013
That makes more sense,
doesn't it?

29:24.013 --> 29:25.431
Into the toy truck.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.224
I got this.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.912
Listen to me.
The guns are in the toy truck.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.710
<i>Eliot, can you stop him?</i>

29:55.294 --> 29:56.587
I'm a little busy right now.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.597
Uh, guys, I'm locked in the trailer.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.307
And we're moving.

30:08.307 --> 30:10.601
Breanna's in the toy truck.

30:30.454 --> 30:31.830
Focus.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.291
This shouldn't be any different
from driving a car.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.295
<i>Guys, Breanna's locked
in the truck with guns</i>

30:38.295 --> 30:40.130
<i>headed to the Dixie Mafia.</i>

30:40.130 --> 30:41.423
<i>We're on our way.</i>

30:41.423 --> 30:42.758
Hey!

30:53.143 --> 30:54.895
There's no real way to ease into this,

30:54.895 --> 30:56.480
so please bear with me,

30:56.480 --> 30:59.233
Luke and Paige have been running
illegal shipments off the docks,

30:59.233 --> 31:02.027
and Luke has just taken off
with the toy drive truck

31:02.027 --> 31:03.821
with guns hidden inside.

31:03.821 --> 31:06.198
They stole the toys for the orphans?

31:06.198 --> 31:09.451
I knew those slimy brats
were up to something.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.704
Wait. Why are you English?

31:11.704 --> 31:14.915
Stay focused, Janice.
Do the trucks have GPS trackers?

31:14.915 --> 31:17.459
The only GPS we have
are on the handheld devices,

31:17.459 --> 31:19.044
but Luke hasn't been issued one.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.671
I'll check the AVI.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.383
They're smuggling guns with toys?

31:24.383 --> 31:25.634
Sophie, where are we going?

31:25.634 --> 31:27.803
There's no way of tracking him
through GPS.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.306
<i>Breanna, can you see anything
at all out of the trailer?</i>

31:30.306 --> 31:33.267
Uh, there's a vent.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.562
- I don't see anything.
- What do you smell?

31:36.562 --> 31:39.815
Smell? Uh, dust, mostly.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.567
No, really smell.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.320
Close your eyes
and take the deepest breath of your life.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.779
What?

31:45.779 --> 31:47.740
- <i>Do it!</i>
- Okay, okay.

31:52.911 --> 31:57.583
Wait, wait, wait. I think I--uh,
I think I smell, uh, ammonia?

31:58.167 --> 32:01.462
Is there a factory nearby
where you might smell ammonia?

32:01.462 --> 32:04.298
Uh, it could be textiles,
it could be fertilizer.

32:04.298 --> 32:06.175
There's a cigar plant on Main.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.761
Eliot, cigar plant, Main Street.

32:08.761 --> 32:11.096
- <i>All right. We're on it.</i>
- Who are you talking to?

32:11.096 --> 32:14.850
I'm sorry, uh, I have friends
tailing Luke trying to stop him

32:14.850 --> 32:17.645
and one of them is locked
in the back of the toy trailer.

32:19.188 --> 32:23.233
Luke Stewart, driving Good Stewart 7689,

32:23.233 --> 32:24.735
pick up immediately.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.987
<i>Pick up, Luke. I know you hear me.</i>

32:26.987 --> 32:28.572
Shut it!

32:36.747 --> 32:39.708
All right. Please work.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.837
Okay.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.095
- It's handbags?
- <i>Yes.</i>

32:51.095 --> 32:53.430
Paige had them take the handbags
down to the toy truck.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.683
Why would she do that unless...

32:55.683 --> 32:57.935
Breanna, look under the handbags.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.071
Uh, I found the guns.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.995
Is that it? Is that it?
We just passed the cigar plant.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.164
Come on, can't this thing go any faster?

33:19.164 --> 33:20.666
Again, it's a food truck.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.169
Really should've let me install
that engine booster Parker wanted.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.130
- You never listen to me.
- Not now. Not now.

33:26.130 --> 33:29.675
All drivers, I need eyeballs
on a Good Stewart 18

33:29.675 --> 33:31.802
driving in the vicinity of 510.

33:31.802 --> 33:36.014
<i>Inexperienced drivers will look
for gear jamming and a possible black eye.</i>

33:36.014 --> 33:37.266
<i>Come back.</i>

33:43.814 --> 33:46.150
Dispatcher, just saw your Good Stewart 18

33:46.150 --> 33:50.070
with Christmas presents on the wagon
headed southbound Main just crossed 17th.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.822
<i>- Over.</i>
- That's it.

33:51.822 --> 33:54.783
I'll get my team there,
but we have to slow Luke down somehow.

33:55.868 --> 33:59.163
Listen up, drivers.
This is a matter of life and death.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.622
Luke, I swear to God,
if you don't pick up,

34:00.622 --> 34:02.207
I'm gonna murder you myself.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.334
Hey, you two.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.795
Luke is in trouble
and I need you to help him.

34:06.795 --> 34:09.089
Oh, you giving me orders now.

34:09.089 --> 34:13.469
It's not an order, but if he gets caught,

34:13.469 --> 34:16.263
I'm telling your boss it was your fault.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.144
Bye.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.023
Luke!

34:39.036 --> 34:40.454
No.

34:40.454 --> 34:42.498
Move, you idiots!

34:48.128 --> 34:51.465
<i>Yeah. Dispatch, we slowed down
your Good Stewart on the boulevard.</i>

34:51.465 --> 34:53.759
Whoo!

34:55.385 --> 34:57.429
Now, who are you?

35:01.058 --> 35:03.060
<i>Breanna, we're pulling up behind you.</i>

35:03.644 --> 35:05.312
Okay. What now?

35:06.814 --> 35:09.900
- Move. Move, I'm going.
- What are you--what--Eliot.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.861
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.030
I don't think it's a good idea.
What if you fall?

35:15.030 --> 35:17.115
Well, then you're gonna have
to jump on the truck

35:17.115 --> 35:18.951
and you're gonna have
to save Breanna then.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.161
All right. You got this.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.673
Oh, God.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.883
Oh, my God.

35:51.942 --> 35:53.360
Shit!

35:58.282 --> 35:59.449
- What? Hey!
- Hey, buddy, how are you?

35:59.449 --> 36:01.076
Good to see you.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wake up. Wake up.
Stay with me. I got it.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.831
I got it. Jump in the back for me, okay.
Can you jump in the back?

36:05.831 --> 36:08.125
There you go, I got you. I got you.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.752
All right. Okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.588
- All right. You with me?
- Who are you?

36:13.463 --> 36:16.884
That's for stealing toys from orphans.
Breanna, are you okay?

36:16.884 --> 36:20.637
I'm great.
I'm just ready to be out of this box.

36:20.637 --> 36:23.640
Yeah. Hey. This is the Silver Bullet Boys.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.684
Thank you so much
for your help upfront, fellas.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.769
I appreciate you.

36:37.404 --> 36:39.573
<i>Eliot, heads up,
you've got company.</i>

36:53.587 --> 36:55.589
- <i>Hang on back there, Breanna.</i>
- Okay.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.337
- What the...
- What? What happened?

37:35.337 --> 37:37.506
Freeze. Hands up.

37:37.506 --> 37:41.259
What seems to be
the problem, officers?

37:41.259 --> 37:44.096
We got a call someone was trying
to hijack a truck full of toys?

37:47.557 --> 37:51.186
I'm just trying to deliver my toys
in time for Christmas,

37:51.186 --> 37:53.689
there's a sports car
trying to run me off the road.

37:53.689 --> 37:54.940
Please hurry.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.826
Science kit. Score.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.251
Thank you for your sacrifice.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.086
All right.

38:17.796 --> 38:18.964
All right.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.970
<i>Breanna, I'm out. What about you?</i>

38:24.970 --> 38:26.638
Almost there.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.644
Well, it must--it must be
a misunderstanding.

38:32.644 --> 38:35.814
Just me and him, we just saw him
falling asleep behind the wheel.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.482
Hey, there's smoke.

38:49.494 --> 38:54.249
You know, fun fact,
real leather is fire resistant,

38:54.249 --> 38:55.375
but pleather...

38:58.462 --> 39:02.340
...smokes and burns like crazy.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.684
It was them!

39:12.684 --> 39:15.270
- They work for Big Jim Montrose!
- You shut it!

39:15.270 --> 39:17.147
And he's been making us
run guns for months.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.774
My sister has records.

39:18.774 --> 39:20.192
- Hands up on the truck.
- Oh, God.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.864
Come on. Luke. Where are you?

39:25.864 --> 39:28.700
Ms. Stewart, we are off for the night.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.077
Oh.

39:30.077 --> 39:33.330
By the way, your brother's just been
arrested and you're about to be as well.

39:33.330 --> 39:37.876
Hey, next time. Don't smuggle guns
with your #PaigeBoss handbags,

39:37.876 --> 39:41.630
which are so ugly, by the way.

39:41.630 --> 39:45.092
Also, have a little think about
what kind of deal you wanna make

39:45.092 --> 39:47.761
- for a reduced sentence, yeah?
- No!

39:47.761 --> 39:49.554
Merry Christmas!

39:49.554 --> 39:51.556
Get back here!

39:53.433 --> 39:54.768
I'm a Paige Boss.

40:01.274 --> 40:04.820
Here it comes!

40:21.378 --> 40:23.171
Merry, merry.

40:23.171 --> 40:25.799
Uh, since Paige and Lucas got arrested,

40:25.799 --> 40:30.929
I went ahead and made you the trustee
of the Good Stewart Trucking Company.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.931
Now, you can run the company
the way it's supposed to be run.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.641
Hire everybody back.

40:34.641 --> 40:35.976
Wow.

40:35.976 --> 40:38.145
I don't think I could ever repay you.

40:38.145 --> 40:40.188
Nor I. I have my truck back.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.607
Well, that's all the repayment we need.

40:44.609 --> 40:49.739
Oh. I'll admit. I--I do feel a touch bad.

40:49.739 --> 40:53.118
I mean, what would Nick say about us
sending Paige and Luke to prison?

40:53.118 --> 40:56.413
Oh, they sent themselves to prison.
And they worked pretty hard to do it.

40:57.664 --> 41:00.500
Well, come on, Ravi.
Let's go watch the kids open presents.

41:03.795 --> 41:08.175
Hey, I told you we'd finish this job
in time to go on our holidays.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.093
Well, what I'm gonna do?
It's Christmas Eve.

41:10.093 --> 41:12.345
Spend my last few Christmasy
hours on a plane?

41:12.345 --> 41:15.974
- Who does that?
- Actually, an alarming amount of people.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.143
- Flights get sold out.
- Okay. Fine.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.313
I just wanted you to spend some time
with loved ones.

41:21.313 --> 41:22.606
We are.

41:22.606 --> 41:25.400
And besides, Nana knows to expect us
for New Year's Eve.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.236
Yeah, couldn't get rid of us if you tried.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.702
And I did try.
