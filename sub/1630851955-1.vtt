WEBVTT

01:18.411 --> 01:20.413
[train engine chugging]

01:28.546 --> 01:32.217
-[man 1, muffled] Hot enough for you?
-[woman 1] She's tried everything.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.135
[horn blares]

01:38.473 --> 01:40.600
[woman 2] What about the looks
she was getting…

01:42.060 --> 01:44.187
[man 2] We were all, frankly, keen on…

01:46.940 --> 01:48.650
[woman 3] No, it's not right for a girl.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.569
[woman 4] …giving you any more money to…

01:53.905 --> 01:55.615
[indistinct chatter]

01:56.324 --> 01:58.785
-[man 2] Look at it this way…
-[woman 5] It's simple to me.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.787
[man 3] I must stay away from…

02:00.870 --> 02:02.956
[whistle blows]

02:03.039 --> 02:04.666
-[man 4] Goin'--
-[man 5] Excuse me.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.210
[woman 6] Feels like
the whole city is out today.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.253
[woman 7] Summer sales.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.589
-Can't keep a New Yorker from a bargain.
-[woman 6] Ain't that the truth?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.758
Let's get to the toy store
and out of this heat.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.469
I'll never hear the end of it
if I don't get my niece a doll.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.179
[woman 7] She asking
for some special sort?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.807
They have those ones
with darling hair you can braid.

02:20.890 --> 02:23.726
-[woman 6] Yes, maybe she'd like that.
-[man 6 whistles] Taxi!

02:23.810 --> 02:24.686
[both women sigh]

02:26.020 --> 02:28.022
-[woman 6] Oh.
-[woman 7] There now, that's better.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.608
[woman 6] Look at that precious
little pickaninny one.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.111
-That, she'll love.
-No.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.322
[woman 6] She's never even met a colored
who didn't work for us. Thank heavens.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.116
-[both exclaim]
-Oh.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.827
No, never mind, ladies.
Accidents will happen.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.704
-[woman 6] My goodness.
-Here you are.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.791
-[shopper] Here.
-[woman 6] Oh! Thank you.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.795
-What a nice lady.
-[woman 6] Mm-hmm.

02:54.799 --> 02:55.884
[shopper sighs]

03:05.101 --> 03:07.061
[clerk] There you go, miss.
Thank you so much.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.398
-[woman 8] Thank you.
-[girl] Mama, I want that one.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.443
[shopper] Do you have
the Mother Goose Drawing and Tracing Book?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.819
[clerk] All sold out.

03:14.903 --> 03:18.907
Figures. I've tried all over town.
My son won't settle for anything but.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.409
[clerk] Try again in a couple weeks.
Might get lucky.

03:21.492 --> 03:25.121
-His birthday's tomorrow.
-[clerk] Well, better luck next time.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.832
[woman laughing]

03:27.916 --> 03:29.083
[indistinct chatter]

03:30.752 --> 03:31.711
[clerk] Thank you.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.344
[car horn blares]

03:39.427 --> 03:41.346
[man 1] Mister?
Hey, are you all right, sir?

03:42.639 --> 03:45.683
Please, somebody, help me.
I… I… Help me out.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.978
He's fallen down. Sir, can you hear me?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.688
[man 2] Sir. Sir, you all right?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.357
-[woman] What's happened?
-I don't know.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.358
[woman] He all right?

03:55.860 --> 03:57.153
[streetcar bell clanging]

04:04.494 --> 04:06.037
[exhales deeply]

04:09.499 --> 04:12.794
[driver] This heat.
Feels like I'm about to pass out myself.

04:13.628 --> 04:17.298
Yes. I guess it's tea I need.
I'm a little faint.

04:17.382 --> 04:21.302
[driver] The Drayton, ma'am? They do say
as how there's always a breeze up there.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.973
-[shopper] The Drayton would be lovely.
-[indistinct chatter]

04:26.724 --> 04:28.101
[man] Oh! Taxi!

04:29.185 --> 04:30.645
Take him to a hospital.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.147
[birds singing]

04:51.749 --> 04:52.625
Thank you.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.422
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.087
[man 1] The waiter will be with you.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.176
[woman 1 whispering] Stop it.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.970
-Now?
-[man 2] Yes, now.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.775
[compact clicks]

05:59.359 --> 06:00.526
[shopper sighs]

06:06.949 --> 06:08.034
[woman 1] You satisfied?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.496
[indistinct whispering continues]

06:18.544 --> 06:19.587
Come here.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.560
[woman 1 giggling]

06:51.035 --> 06:51.994
[man 3] See you later.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.955
[woman 2] Don't be long.
I'll get another one.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.415
[man 3] I won't. I hope.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.209
-You'll be all right?
-[woman 2] I'll be just fine.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.630
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy this cool room.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.674
-[man 3] All right.
-[woman 2] All right.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.136
-[man 3] I suppose I should…
-[woman 2] I suppose you should.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.400
-[imperceptible]
-Oh!

07:24.068 --> 07:26.446
[indistinct whispering
and chuckling continues]

07:47.717 --> 07:49.051
[man 2] We'll be married soon.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.098
As far as they know, we are.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.226
[shopper sighs]

07:59.854 --> 08:03.941
Pardon me. I don't mean to stare,
but I think I know you.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.943
[shopper] I'm afraid you're mistaken.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.030
No, of course I know you, Rene.

08:09.822 --> 08:13.534
You look just the same.
Tell me, do they still call you Rene?

08:13.618 --> 08:16.954
[Irene] Yes, though no one's
called me that for a long time.

08:19.707 --> 08:20.791
Don't you know me?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.295
Not really, Rene?

08:28.049 --> 08:30.092
I'm afraid I can't seem to place…

08:31.219 --> 08:33.221
[woman 2 giggles]

08:34.805 --> 08:36.724
-Clare?
-[Clare] Mm-hmm.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.309
That's right.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.607
-Not Clare Kendry?
-[Clare] Mm-hmm.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.942
Now, don't run away.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.070
You simply must stay and talk.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.782
Fancy meeting you here.
It's simply too lucky.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.367
It's awfully surprising, yes.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.202
[Clare] Mmm.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.704
[giggling]

08:58.788 --> 09:01.123
I'd never have known you
if you hadn't laughed.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.417
You've changed so.

09:03.501 --> 09:05.378
Well, it's been 12 years at least.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.423
You know, I almost dropped by
your father's house not so long ago.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.592
I've thought of you so often.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.844
-You have?
-[Clare] Of course.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.641
You know, since I've been here,
I've hoped I might run into someone.

09:18.724 --> 09:22.228
Preferably you, though.
And now you're here.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.525
I'll wager you haven't given me a thought.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.110
So…

09:31.279 --> 09:32.280
Tell me.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.076
I want to know everything.
Married? Children?

09:37.159 --> 09:41.247
-Yes. Two boys. You?
-Mm-hmm.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.709
One girl. Margery. She's my angel.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.211
My husband John's here on business.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.422
Banking business.
In this heat! Can you imagine?

09:49.505 --> 09:50.673
That was your husband?

09:51.507 --> 09:55.303
[chuckles softly]
We've been here a whole week from Chicago.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.387
That's home.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.308
Although I come here
and remember what home really is.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.148
Well, we can see lots of one another
these days that I'm here, can't we?

10:07.648 --> 10:11.652
I don't know… I mean… I'm just…

10:12.820 --> 10:15.072
I live in Harlem, still.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.867
I don't come
to this part of town a whole lot.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.746
Oh, that's sad.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.375
Perhaps I can come visit
with you another time in Harlem?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.002
Meet your boys?

10:29.378 --> 10:30.421
We're here quite often.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.716
And if this trip goes well,
well, John's quite sure we'll move.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.679
It's my dream to come back, Rene.

10:40.181 --> 10:41.349
[chuckles]

10:42.767 --> 10:43.934
I'm sure.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.023
Clare…

10:52.234 --> 10:53.152
does he…

10:54.612 --> 10:55.488
Know?

10:58.991 --> 10:59.950
[chuckles]

11:01.243 --> 11:03.829
Let's go up to my suite,
where we can talk properly.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.749
Waiter!

11:07.875 --> 11:11.295
Ugh. I can't bear this heat!
I have to change.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.465
John'll be back soon.

11:15.091 --> 11:18.177
And here I am, sweatin' up a storm.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.262
-That's nice.
-Oh!

11:20.346 --> 11:23.683
I found Gert Johnson in the phone book.
Well, Gertrude Martin now.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.184
She married Fred. Remember?

11:25.267 --> 11:28.896
Yes. I haven't seen Fred
for an unmentionable time.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.898
Well, they have twins.
Isn't that wonderful?

11:30.981 --> 11:33.442
-Mmm.
-Boys. Oh, I'd love boys.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.903
I'd never risk it again, though.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.031
I went through hell those nine months
for fear Margery might turn out dark.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.324
Mine are dark.

11:42.159 --> 11:44.453
Oh. And your husband, he…

11:44.537 --> 11:49.291
He… couldn't exactly "pass,"
if that's what you mean.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.086
Oh, I thought…

11:52.878 --> 11:55.381
Oh. [laughing]

11:57.383 --> 11:59.719
Oh, well, then. [chuckles]

12:02.346 --> 12:03.222
Would you?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.684
Would you?

12:17.820 --> 12:20.364
Well, anyway, she goes as white.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.953
-So, you haven't ever thought to?
-What?

12:28.706 --> 12:31.250
I'm asking
if you ever thought of passing, Rene.

12:32.334 --> 12:33.669
No, why should I?

12:35.713 --> 12:39.759
I mean, for convenience,
occasionally, I suppose. But no.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.261
I just mean
I have everything I've ever wanted.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.972
Except perhaps
a little more money. [scoffs]

12:45.055 --> 12:48.517
Of course. That's all
anybody ever wants, a little more money.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.643
[chuckles]

12:49.727 --> 12:51.771
Money's an awfully nice thing to have.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.776
In fact, all things considered,
I think it's entirely worth the price.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.614
I should go, Clare.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.366
I'm not sure
it's such a good idea if John…

13:04.450 --> 13:06.160
Oh, no, Rene, it is.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.289
Oh, you must stay a little while longer.
Oh, please say you'll stay.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.168
Hang it! I've made a mess.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.921
Give me a second,
and I'll order us some food up here.

13:17.671 --> 13:18.672
All right.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.849
Whatcha thinking, Rene?

13:30.768 --> 13:32.186
You're curious, is that it?

13:33.270 --> 13:35.231
You can ask me anything.
Anything you want.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.194
What have you told him… of your family?

13:43.197 --> 13:46.492
You know, I haven't had to worry
as much as you'd think.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.619
There were my aunts, you see.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.789
They took me in after Father died
and gave me a home of sorts.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.335
[exhales deeply] Very white,
very respectable, very religious.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.629
I met John not long after,

13:58.712 --> 14:02.424
and as soon as I turned 18 and legal,
we got married and…

14:03.551 --> 14:05.970
well, went off and left for good.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.516
And you're happy?

14:11.517 --> 14:12.768
Of course, Rene.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.355
As you say,
I have everything I ever wanted.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.237
I'm sorry, Clare, that was rude of me.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.447
Of course you're happy.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.825
-Look at you.
-[Clare chuckles]

14:30.703 --> 14:34.248
-And your daughter?
-Margery? Oh, she's divine.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.960
John wants to put her in one of those
Swiss boarding schools in the fall.

14:38.043 --> 14:42.256
I dare say she'll get quite the education.
Not like anything we had.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.092
Room service, hello?

14:45.676 --> 14:49.930
We want cakes.
The most beautiful cakes you have.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.432
Mm-hmm.

14:51.932 --> 14:55.728
Tell me, what tea you got
passes for French champagne?

14:58.355 --> 14:59.315
Oh, I'm messing!

15:00.524 --> 15:06.238
Yes, we'll take a pitcher of iced tea
in champagne flutes.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.824
Mm-hmm. We're celebrating.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.745
[both laughing]

15:13.746 --> 15:17.416
-[Irene] That's enough, thank you.
-Have a drop more. You've hardly had any.

15:17.499 --> 15:18.751
[door opens]

15:18.834 --> 15:22.463
-[John] Nig?
-John, dear! [kisses]

15:23.130 --> 15:26.133
I ran into an old,
old friend of mine from school.

15:26.216 --> 15:30.137
Irene Westover.
Irene, this is my husband, John Bellew.

15:30.220 --> 15:32.264
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Westover.

15:32.848 --> 15:35.768
-Actually, it's Mrs. Redfield.
-[John] Mm.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.189
Oh, of course, I…
I didn't even think to ask.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.857
I am sorry if I've interrupted.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.444
-Will you get me a drink, honey?
-[Clare] Here.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.612
[John] Thank you.

15:46.695 --> 15:47.780
[sniffles] Hmm.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.325
So, what do you say, then? To old friends?

15:52.993 --> 15:54.828
-To old friends!
-To old friends.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.414
[Clare chuckles]

16:01.794 --> 16:02.795
[knocking on door]

16:02.878 --> 16:05.881
-Did you hear what John called me, Rene?
-Oh, Clare, please.

16:06.465 --> 16:09.134
[Clare] No, go on, tell her why.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.803
[John chuckles] Oh, it's silly.

16:10.886 --> 16:14.473
When we were first married,
this woman was as white as a lily.

16:14.556 --> 16:19.103
But as the years go by,
she seems to be getting darker and darker.

16:19.895 --> 16:23.107
So I told her, "If you don't look out,
you'll wake up one morning

16:23.190 --> 16:25.401
and find
that you've turned into a nigger."

16:27.569 --> 16:29.571
Yeah. She's been Nig ever since.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.990
[all giggling]

16:37.454 --> 16:40.249
[laughs hysterically]

16:44.795 --> 16:45.921
That's good!

16:47.715 --> 16:48.716
Well, it's silly.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.260
No, that's… That's…

16:51.343 --> 16:52.720
That's good.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.221
My goodness, John!

16:56.348 --> 16:57.975
After all these years,
what would it matter

16:58.058 --> 17:01.145
if you found out
that I was 1 or 2% colored, hmm?

17:01.228 --> 17:04.565
Well, you can turn as black
as you please, as far as I'm concerned.

17:04.648 --> 17:05.983
I know you're not colored.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.363
So, you dislike Negroes, Mr. Bellew?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.533
No, no, no, not at all. I hate them.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.244
[John and Clare laugh]

17:17.327 --> 17:21.290
But not as much as Nig does,
for all she's trying to turn into one.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.084
Why, she won't have them near her,
not even as a maid.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.086
Isn't that true?

17:26.795 --> 17:28.922
Have you ever known any Negroes?

17:30.174 --> 17:33.719
[John] No, no,
but I do know people who know them.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.638
And I read about them
in the papers, of course.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.892
Terrible mess. Robbing, killing.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.269
[sighs] It's sad, really.

17:42.352 --> 17:46.899
John, Rene doesn't want to hear
about your pet perversions.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.693
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bore you.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.279
You live nearby?

17:53.781 --> 17:54.698
Fairly.

17:55.324 --> 17:59.036
[John] It's a great city, New York.
City of the future.

17:59.995 --> 18:02.498
-What line of work is your husband in?
-He's a doctor.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.877
-[John] That's an interesting life.
-[Irene] Yes. Hard. Nerve-racking too.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.297
Wife's nerves, too, I bet.
All those lady patients.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.300
John, dear, don't start! More tea, Rene?

18:13.383 --> 18:15.844
I've taken up
too much of your time already.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.472
Oh, but we're just getting started!

18:19.807 --> 18:22.017
-Thank you for the drink.
-[John] I'll see you out.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.316
[Clare] Rene.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.654
-I do hope to see you soon.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Redfield.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.365
-Glad to have met you.
-[Irene] Goodbye, Clare.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.912
[breathes deeply]

18:45.582 --> 18:47.584
[jazz piano music playing]

18:48.627 --> 18:50.087
[crickets chirping]

18:50.170 --> 18:52.172
[child shouting in distance]

19:02.850 --> 19:04.518
-[Irene] Evening, Lance.
-Evening.

19:34.131 --> 19:36.008
[children talking indistinctly]

19:57.571 --> 19:58.572
[husband] Hmm.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.618
Where you been?

20:03.118 --> 20:04.745
Lookin' for that darn book.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.373
-They eat?
-I think so.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.918
I was gonna put them to bed, but…

20:11.001 --> 20:13.420
-But you fell asleep.
-Apparently.

20:19.092 --> 20:20.135
[husband] Mm.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.013
Am I still sleeping?

20:32.856 --> 20:34.066
[chuckling]

20:42.783 --> 20:44.785
[birds singing]

20:54.002 --> 20:54.836
[horns honking]

21:10.477 --> 21:11.311
Catch it!

21:12.646 --> 21:13.689
Pass, pass.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.318
[husband] Hey. Come here.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.698
[grunts]

21:24.199 --> 21:27.411
-I thought you nailed this already.
-[son 1] I forget sometimes.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.037
[husband] All right, ten minutes.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.504
-[son 1] Catch the ball, okay?
-[son 2] I don't want to.

21:38.338 --> 21:39.589
[son 1] Don't lose it.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.386
It's boring. Play with me.

21:45.220 --> 21:46.596
[son 2] Just leave me alone.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.181
Damn!

21:48.849 --> 21:50.225
[sighs in exasperation]

21:52.894 --> 21:55.188
-Caught!
-[gasps] Damn it!

21:55.272 --> 21:57.774
Brian, why you gotta be
creepin' around the place like that?

21:57.858 --> 21:58.984
Profanity, miss!

21:59.860 --> 22:01.069
They'll be late for school.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.990
I'm not gonna have time to make it
to my next call if I have to drop you.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.911
-[maid] Boys, come on in.
-Irene?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.497
[maid] Yes, yes,
you have to come on in now.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.582
Sorry, honey.

22:21.923 --> 22:24.593
I was just thinking
how much Junior is getting like you.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.552
[Brian] Mmm.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.763
I wonder if he isn't
going too fast in school.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.139
It's easy to forget he's younger.

22:29.222 --> 22:32.642
I wish you wouldn't be
ever fretting about those boys.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.854
They are fine. They're perfectly
good, strong, healthy boys.

22:35.937 --> 22:36.855
I suppose.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.399
I'm just afraid
he's picked up some queer ideas

22:39.483 --> 22:41.485
about things from some of the older boys.

22:41.568 --> 22:43.028
"Queer"? What about?

22:43.111 --> 22:45.864
You know,
things young boys be thinking about.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.992
Ah. You mean about sex?

22:49.493 --> 22:51.953
Yes. Jokes. Things like that.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.664
If sex isn't a joke, what is it?

22:55.832 --> 22:58.502
-What is a joke?
-Don't be facetious.

22:58.585 --> 22:59.419
You ready?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.798
No, you go. I'll take the bus.

23:03.757 --> 23:07.219
-Pick you up, then?
-Please. From the printing office.

23:07.302 --> 23:10.013
I need to see about more handbills
and tickets for the dance.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.598
They should be paying you.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.227
It isn't charity work
if they pay me for it.

23:25.737 --> 23:26.738
[indistinct chatter]

23:26.822 --> 23:28.573
-[maid] Go on, boys.
-[Brian] Are we ready?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.158
[Irene] Lickety-split!

23:30.242 --> 23:31.701
-Come back.
-Are you ready?

23:31.785 --> 23:32.702
-I'm fast.
-Let's go.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.121
-Go on, boys, get.
-Junior.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.748
-[son 2] I don't wanna go!
-[Brian] You have to, I'm afraid.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.833
[Junior] Bye, Mama.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.044
-I'm too fast! Can't catch me.
-[son 2] Get back here.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.504
[door closes]

23:42.587 --> 23:43.922
[clock ticking]

24:26.214 --> 24:28.133
-You want grapefruit, ma'am?
-Mm-hmm.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.720
Thank you.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.319
Ugh, my hat.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.533
Oh, Ms. Redfield, you forgot one.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.246
Thank you.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.846
-Do you want me to drive?
-Mmm.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.808
Yeah, sure.

25:24.105 --> 25:24.940
[grunts]

25:30.362 --> 25:31.863
Everything set?

25:32.531 --> 25:35.742
We're a month away and all the bookings
are gone, not counting the door.

25:36.493 --> 25:39.162
-Busy as a cat with fleas myself.
-Ain't you cold?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.374
No, leave it, if you're not cold.

25:47.003 --> 25:47.963
[car horn honks]

25:48.046 --> 25:50.549
[sighs] This city!

25:51.091 --> 25:53.718
I think I'm beginning to hate sick people.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.973
Their stupid meddling families,
their dirty, smelly rooms--

25:58.056 --> 25:59.849
Come on, now. It's just a bad day.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.894
You don't mean that.
You're helping those sick people.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.188
-Let's not talk about it.
-You brought it up.

26:06.231 --> 26:07.649
[sighs]

26:13.321 --> 26:15.657
-Put the window down.
-Thought you were cold.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.118
Now I'm saying I can't breathe.
Put the window down.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.501
I know you think trying somewhere else
would be easier for us.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.421
South America or some such.
And to a point, I agree.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.090
We should go abroad somewhere.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.843
Not for a while, of course,
but when the boys leave…

26:36.344 --> 26:37.971
-We can visit Brazil.
-Visit?

26:39.931 --> 26:42.976
Or I was thinking of one of them
European schools for Junior.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.979
You are going to make
a mollycoddle out of that boy.

26:46.062 --> 26:48.398
Ted is the one who needs your attention,
not Junior,

26:48.481 --> 26:52.611
and you needn't think I'll let you send
Junior to some nice kindergarten school

26:52.694 --> 26:54.821
'cause he's getting
a much-needed education.

26:54.904 --> 26:58.908
Sooner he learns about sex, the better.
Certainly if he learns it's a grand joke.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.201
The greatest in the world.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.495
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

27:04.372 --> 27:08.960
I'm just getting a little tired
of playing second fiddle

27:09.044 --> 27:12.172
to your precious Negro League, that's all.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.177
How about a little charity for this Negro?

27:17.260 --> 27:19.471
[Irene] Come on, now.
There's people looking.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.316
What's this?

27:32.484 --> 27:35.153
-I think it's from Clare Bellew.
-Clare Bellew?

27:35.862 --> 27:39.032
[grunts] That woman from Chicago
you told me about running into?

27:39.616 --> 27:41.493
-Mm-hmm.
-You gonna see her again?

27:43.578 --> 27:45.038
I haven't opened the letter.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.249
-It's postmarked New York.
-I know.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.544
-They must've moved here.
-Brian, I'm not going to see her.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.630
Thought you were good friends in school.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.716
Brian, darling,
I'd have to be an idiot not to realize

27:56.800 --> 27:59.803
if a man calls me a you-know-what,
it's his fault the first time,

27:59.886 --> 28:02.305
but mine if I give him
the opportunity to do it again.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.306
Sure, sure.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.475
May I?

28:20.073 --> 28:24.744
"I am so lonely, so lonely…"

28:25.370 --> 28:27.497
"Cannot help longing
to be with you again."

28:27.580 --> 28:32.293
-Don't mock her. That's not fair.
-I'm just reading it. [chuckles]

28:32.377 --> 28:33.378
Fine.

28:34.254 --> 28:38.133
"You can't know
how in this pale life of mine,

28:38.216 --> 28:41.594
I am all the time seeing
the bright pictures of that other

28:42.095 --> 28:44.389
that I thought
I was so glad to be free of."

28:45.974 --> 28:47.016
[Irene sighs]

28:48.268 --> 28:50.687
Oh, come on, it's funny!
She's very dramatic.

28:51.521 --> 28:53.982
"It may be, Rene dear,

28:55.150 --> 28:58.611
that your way may be the wiser
and infinitely happier one."

28:58.695 --> 29:02.323
I'm flattered. "Wiser." As if anything
could rectify the humiliation…

29:02.407 --> 29:03.742
Wait, wait, there's more.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.453
"I wouldn't feel this wild desire…

29:07.537 --> 29:08.663
if I hadn't seen you."

29:11.499 --> 29:12.417
That's rich.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.044
Blaming you.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.550
"Wild desire."

29:22.343 --> 29:23.595
Don't give her an inch.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.355
What you so angry for anyhow?

29:35.398 --> 29:38.109
-Husband didn't call you a--
-No, but he would've.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.694
It amounts to the same thing.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.905
[Brian] It has, you will admit,
its humorous side.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.992
[Irene] No, I won't.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.787
It's not funny, it's revolting.

29:48.870 --> 29:53.208
Irene, leave it, huh?
It's normal. They always come back.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.628
They have to work hard at getting there,
why would they wanna come back?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.755
If I knew that, I'd know what race is.

29:59.255 --> 30:01.591
You'd think they'd be
satisfied being white.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.427
Rot! Who's satisfied being anything?

30:16.064 --> 30:16.981
I am.

30:18.024 --> 30:18.858
[Brian] Hmm?

30:20.819 --> 30:21.820
Satisfied.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.699
I am.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.375
-[Brian] Let's go. Wait, Junior!
-Come on, boys.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.919
-Books, books.
-Bye, Mama.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.045
[Junior] Bye, Mama.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.924
-[chuckles] Bye.
-[door closes]

30:55.311 --> 30:56.813
[jazz music playing]

31:14.455 --> 31:17.166
I got yams for tonight.
Save the chicken for tomorrow.

31:17.250 --> 31:18.334
Yes, ma'am.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.212
-Did you clean the boys' room already?
-Not yet.

31:21.296 --> 31:24.549
Well, hurry. They'll be back soon
and then it'll be impossible.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.010
Can I get you something?

31:27.594 --> 31:28.720
No. I can get it.

31:30.096 --> 31:31.306
[clock ticking]

31:42.066 --> 31:43.359
[clock chiming]

31:54.454 --> 31:56.164
[phone ringing]

32:08.593 --> 32:09.719
Redfield residence.

32:11.471 --> 32:12.639
Yes, hello.

32:13.848 --> 32:14.807
Mm-hmm.

32:15.683 --> 32:16.893
It's Mr. Wentworth.

32:22.315 --> 32:24.275
Hello. Yes, Hugh.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.444
Oh, quite, and you?

32:26.527 --> 32:27.445
[doorbell chimes]

32:27.528 --> 32:31.157
Every single one, honest. I know…

32:32.408 --> 32:35.912
Wait, I'll give mine to Bianca.
I won't need it anyway.

32:35.995 --> 32:38.247
-[door opens]
-No, I mean it.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.917
It was silly of me not to,
I'll be so busy…

32:49.050 --> 32:49.968
[Clare] Mm-hmm.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.352
Well, as long as Brian has a place
to drop down now and then…

32:59.435 --> 33:01.020
-[indistinct chatter]
-Uh-huh.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.443
That's nice. My love to Bianca.

33:08.069 --> 33:12.198
Yes, I'll see to it right away.
See you tomorrow, Hugh. Bye.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.285
[sighs]

33:22.500 --> 33:26.921
[gasps, chuckles] Dear God,
but aren't you lovely, Clare.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.342
Didn't you mean to
answer my letter, Rene?

33:34.053 --> 33:36.556
Every day I went
to that nasty little post office.

33:36.639 --> 33:39.851
They thought I was having an affair
and the man had thrown me over.

33:39.934 --> 33:42.103
-Oh! Clare, I…
-Well…

33:43.062 --> 33:44.272
Eventually it sunk in.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.733
You hadn't written to me
and didn't intend to.

33:47.775 --> 33:50.653
I tried very hard to forget,
I really did, but I couldn't.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.532
I had to know why. That's why I came here.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.037
Why didn't you write to me, Rene?

34:09.589 --> 34:10.506
You see…

34:14.844 --> 34:17.513
Well… you see…

34:25.021 --> 34:26.689
I can't help thinking that…

34:28.900 --> 34:30.109
you ought not to…

34:31.903 --> 34:33.446
ought not to come up here.

34:33.529 --> 34:35.490
-You mean you don't want me here.
-No.

34:35.573 --> 34:37.408
What I said,
you ought not to run the risk.

34:37.492 --> 34:41.954
It's terribly foolish.
You must see that, and, well…

34:44.373 --> 34:45.541
just not the right thing.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.918
[chuckles] Oh!

34:47.627 --> 34:51.047
Rene, you are priceless.
The right thing?

34:51.130 --> 34:53.466
-I mean, it isn't safe.
-Safe?

34:53.549 --> 34:57.428
To come up here. Considering what I saw
of Mr. Bellew's attitude.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.016
Oh, of course, I understand.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.937
And I don't blame you
for being angry, Rene.

35:06.646 --> 35:10.441
You acted beautifully that day,
really beautifully. Thank you.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.194
I don't want thanks.

35:13.277 --> 35:18.199
I just mean that… it was very kind of you
to be so delicate about it.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.159
What other option did I have, Clare?

35:21.077 --> 35:23.871
I have been furious at you,
really furious.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.706
-Putting me in that position.
-Of course.

35:25.790 --> 35:28.376
I can't see why you wouldn't
understand why I wouldn't write.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.418
Foolish of me.

35:29.502 --> 35:31.420
Why I wouldn't want
anything to do with you!

35:32.505 --> 35:34.799
[crying]

35:40.596 --> 35:42.431
Oh, no, now…

35:45.226 --> 35:47.311
-Don't cry.
-[sobbing]

35:47.395 --> 35:50.231
I just… I feel so terrible about it all.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.484
Oh, I… I didn't think…

35:54.443 --> 35:56.237
I'm so very sorry, Rene.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.032
There, there. Don't be.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.160
I'm sorry too.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.744
[Clare chuckles]

36:04.996 --> 36:05.955
[sniffles]

36:09.250 --> 36:12.461
Oh, darn it. The truth is
I'm very glad to see you, Clare.

36:13.963 --> 36:14.839
Very.

36:15.756 --> 36:18.801
Oh, and I you, Rene. You can't imagine.

36:19.802 --> 36:24.307
Without that day, I would've got
to the end, unable to speak to anyone.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.684
[chuckles] You can't know.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.563
Never anyone to really talk to.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.774
It was insensitive of me
not to think about that.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.860
Oh, I don't expect you to understand.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.029
You're happy.

36:39.780 --> 36:43.659
You have a true, good life,
and you're free.

36:45.036 --> 36:45.953
Free and safe.

36:47.955 --> 36:49.457
Safe. [scoffs]

36:50.625 --> 36:52.710
I don't even know what that is anymore.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.796
[children laughing indistinctly]

36:57.006 --> 37:01.052
I'm beginning to believe that no one
is ever completely happy, free, or safe.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.263
Well, then, what does it matter
if I come up here sometimes?

37:04.347 --> 37:08.976
You have a child, Clare.
It's not just a matter of your safety.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.353
[phone ringing]

37:12.063 --> 37:14.649
Being a mother
is the cruelest thing in the world.

37:15.775 --> 37:17.860
-[maid] Hello. Redfield residence.
-Yes.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.029
[maid] One moment…

37:20.112 --> 37:21.447
And the most responsible.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.493
Mr. Wentworth
is on the telephone again, ma'am.

37:26.285 --> 37:27.286
[Irene] Excuse me.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.550
Hello?

37:46.889 --> 37:51.686
Oh, honestly, Hugh, tell her to stop
being silly. I've told you it's fine.

37:52.645 --> 37:54.814
Mm-hmm. See you tomorrow.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.239
You sound busy.

38:03.864 --> 38:06.826
It's this
Negro Welfare League dance tomorrow.

38:06.909 --> 38:10.579
I'm on the organizational committee.
I am the committee, pretty much.

38:10.663 --> 38:14.333
-Hugh Wentworth, the novelist?
-Yes. Do you know him?

38:14.417 --> 38:16.585
-I've read a book or two of his.
-You have?

38:17.086 --> 38:17.962
[chuckles softly]

38:18.045 --> 38:20.172
-They're good, aren't they?
-I suppose.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.757
Sort of contemptuous.

38:23.092 --> 38:25.678
Yes. Well, he's a dear, really.

38:26.345 --> 38:28.014
Mind if I do some things around the house?

38:28.097 --> 38:30.224
-I wasn't expecting guests.
-Oh, I don't mind.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.642
You can show me your home.

38:33.477 --> 38:36.188
So, Hugh Wentworth's
coming up to your dance, huh?

38:36.272 --> 38:38.316
[chuckles] Yes. Why not?

38:40.109 --> 38:41.277
Curious to me.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.238
A man like that going to a Negro dance.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.283
Hundreds of white people like Hugh
come to affairs in Harlem now

38:47.366 --> 38:50.244
-Why?
-Same reason you're here. To see Negroes.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.205
What are you doing, boys?

38:54.498 --> 38:56.959
To enjoy themselves, to get material,

38:57.043 --> 39:00.046
to gaze on the great and near-great
as they gaze on the Negroes.

39:00.129 --> 39:02.256
Rene, suppose I come too?

39:02.340 --> 39:06.844
-Why, because so many white people go?
-No, because it'll be fun.

39:06.927 --> 39:10.097
I don't know.
What if somebody recognizes you?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.932
I'll take my chances on getting by.

39:12.016 --> 39:14.894
-You'll be bored stiff.
-I won't, honestly. I won't.

39:14.977 --> 39:17.897
-I won't be able to look after you.
-I'll be as good as gold.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.900
I'll just sit there
and gaze at the great and not-so-great.

39:20.983 --> 39:23.652
Look, I don't care
what you do or where you go,

39:23.736 --> 39:25.780
but I don't see why you should
put yourself in a place

39:25.863 --> 39:27.114
that might bring you trouble.

39:28.324 --> 39:29.200
Damn John!

39:30.826 --> 39:33.371
He gets in the way of everything I want.
I could kill him.

39:33.871 --> 39:34.789
I wouldn't.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.833
There's still capital punishment
in this state, at least.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.630
I want so much to be around Negroes again.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.883
Talk with them, hear them laugh.

39:48.135 --> 39:49.637
I've almost forgotten it…

39:50.763 --> 39:51.597
[pot shatters]

39:52.390 --> 39:53.307
Damn!

39:56.602 --> 39:59.313
-Shall I go down?
-No, it's nothing.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.148
Zu will clean it.

40:03.901 --> 40:04.860
Zu!

40:06.904 --> 40:09.698
Come to the dance if you want to.
I'm not going to stop you.

40:09.782 --> 40:13.369
[Clare] Thank you, Rene.
That's so kind of you. Really, thank you.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.286
[Irene] Boys?

40:14.370 --> 40:16.539
-[Junior] What do you want? We're busy.
-[Irene] Junior.

40:16.622 --> 40:20.709
Oh, now, don't be cross.
I know I've gone and spoiled everything,

40:20.793 --> 40:23.712
but if I promise not to get in the way,
will you let me in?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.969
It will just be us for dinner.

40:30.052 --> 40:32.513
It's just as well.
I don't have any more for more.

40:33.389 --> 40:37.268
Well, they were the cowboys
and I was the Indian,

40:37.351 --> 40:39.562
and they captured me
right outside the fort.

40:40.062 --> 40:41.856
But I think I just made my getaway.

40:41.939 --> 40:44.150
[children playing indistinctly]

40:44.233 --> 40:45.651
[Irene chuckles]

40:45.734 --> 40:48.571
Pay him no attention.
Junior gets ahead of himself fast.

40:49.738 --> 40:54.368
Mmm. What's cooking?
Yams? How you fixin' them?

40:54.452 --> 40:59.039
-Butter, salt, sugar. Simple.
-[giggles] Simple!

40:59.123 --> 41:02.460
Why, it's just about
the most perfect taste on God's earth!

41:04.295 --> 41:05.880
Where did you find her, Rene?

41:06.380 --> 41:08.757
I long for a maid
who knows real home cookin'.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.136
-[Irene] It's not like that.
-Not like what?

41:12.219 --> 41:14.263
Everyone needs help. It's normal.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.854
-Maybe next time you can stay for dinner.
-Oh, please, yes.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.399
How about I stop by tomorrow
and we can go to the dance together?

41:25.483 --> 41:26.692
All right.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.737
-All right. See you tomorrow, then.
-Tomorrow. Yes.

41:30.946 --> 41:32.573
-Bye, Rene.
-[Irene] Mm.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.037
[jazz piano music playing]

41:42.208 --> 41:43.709
[indistinct chatter]

41:49.173 --> 41:51.258
-All right, come on in.
-I didn't get a chance yet.

42:06.023 --> 42:10.653
-Thought you might've fallen asleep.
-No. Out on time. For once.

42:10.736 --> 42:12.112
Ooh, good.

42:13.989 --> 42:18.035
-You nervous?
-Hey, get off. You're sitting on my dress.

42:30.923 --> 42:33.467
-Clare's coming. Clare Bellew.
-Hmm?

42:34.760 --> 42:37.221
-That crazy woman, Clare?
-Her, yes, her.

42:37.304 --> 42:38.556
Crazy woman Clare Bellew.

42:38.639 --> 42:40.849
-She's not crazy.
-Since when?

42:40.933 --> 42:42.893
Just… different.

42:42.977 --> 42:44.019
[Brian chuckles]

42:47.356 --> 42:51.068
She surprised me with a visit yesterday.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.238
Yesterday?
Why in the world didn't you tell me?

42:54.321 --> 42:57.324
-Don't know. I had a lot to think about.
-Irene.

42:57.408 --> 43:00.828
She made it sound not such a problem
if she came with us, so…

43:00.911 --> 43:01.996
I said fine.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.084
-She's coming here?
-Any minute, I would think.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.128
Be nice, huh?

43:10.588 --> 43:11.755
I highly doubt it.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.008
I mean, you be nice to her.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.426
I will be polite.

43:21.390 --> 43:22.808
[Irene] Gonna dress or lie there?

43:33.402 --> 43:35.696
Quit hovering. Go wait for me downstairs.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.038
Wait, I'm sorry. I love you.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.416
Boy! You are nervous.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.758
-[doorbell chimes]
-[breathes deeply]

44:00.179 --> 44:01.889
[Clare] Oh, I thought
I'd never get better.

44:01.972 --> 44:04.183
I had such a fever.
I thought I'd die. Truly.

44:04.266 --> 44:07.770
[Brian] It was quite the epidemic.
I can't recall how many cases I treated.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.521
-Not all of them made it.
-Mmm.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.273
-So you're lucky.
-Yeah.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.567
[Brian] Of course,
many more survived on my watch.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.486
-[Clare giggles]
-I'm not bragging.

44:15.569 --> 44:16.904
[Clare] And what if you are?

44:17.571 --> 44:20.616
-It's worth bragging about if it's true.
-[chuckles]

44:20.699 --> 44:21.742
You may be right.

44:24.161 --> 44:26.538
I'm sorry,
I didn't realize you were here already.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.916
Don't worry.
We made our own introductions.

44:28.999 --> 44:30.125
Yeah, we did.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.461
-You look lovely, Rene.
-[Brian] Mm-hmm.

44:34.713 --> 44:37.091
I'm afraid I may have chosen all wrong.

44:37.716 --> 44:40.177
Rot! It's perfect.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.304
-[Junior] …do it again.
-[Ted] You told me.

44:42.388 --> 44:43.889
Here they are!

44:44.765 --> 44:46.892
Well, how do I look?

44:47.559 --> 44:49.603
-Like a princess.
-[giggling]

44:50.396 --> 44:51.939
All right, all right.

44:52.022 --> 44:54.608
-Good night and good night.
-[Irene] Good night.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.569
I feel exactly as I used to
the night before Christmas.

44:57.653 --> 45:00.864
I knew there was a surprise waiting
for me, but I could never guess what.

45:00.948 --> 45:03.033
-Ah.
-I'm so excited.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.953
-You can't possibly imagine.
-[car horn honks]

45:06.036 --> 45:08.497
-"You can't possibly imagine."
-[Irene] Stop now.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.875
-[woman] Hi.
-[upbeat jazz music playing]

45:11.959 --> 45:15.003
-[indistinct chatter]
-[woman] That music sounds good.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.549
[man] They'll be there.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.092
[music continues playing]

45:21.301 --> 45:23.303
[indistinct chatter]

45:32.813 --> 45:34.773
Bianca, I am outraged.

45:44.950 --> 45:45.784
There's Hugh!

45:46.994 --> 45:48.078
[Brian] Anywhere to sit?

45:48.871 --> 45:51.081
In that booth with Hugh
if we can get there.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.208
[Clare] What a hoot!

46:07.055 --> 46:08.056
[man] There he goes!

46:30.078 --> 46:32.080
[woman] Hey, where'd you learn this dance?

46:32.164 --> 46:33.832
[man] You taught me everything I know.

46:33.916 --> 46:35.751
[laughing] Felise, Dave!

46:35.834 --> 46:38.796
-It's a triumph! The band is peachy!
-It's a riot!

46:39.838 --> 46:42.341
-Come on, Brian. We're going dancing.
-[Brian] What--

46:42.424 --> 46:45.302
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

46:45.385 --> 46:47.346
Look out, Clare.
The man has two left feet.

46:50.724 --> 46:52.017
-Is that true?
-No.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.312
-Yes, it's very true. Bit rusty.
-[chuckles]

46:55.395 --> 46:57.147
-Well, let's give it a go.
-All right.

47:02.194 --> 47:03.070
Okay.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.414
"Poor man, rich man, beggar man, thief…"
How's the rest of it go?

47:14.498 --> 47:19.294
[Hugh] "Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief."
All here and a few more.

47:23.549 --> 47:26.885
What I'm trying to find out
is the history and status

47:26.969 --> 47:30.347
of the blonde beauty out of the fairy tale
that you've brought along.

47:30.430 --> 47:31.306
[Clare] See?

47:31.390 --> 47:32.599
[both laughing]

47:32.683 --> 47:35.227
[Hugh] The one currently seen
dancing with your husband.

47:35.310 --> 47:39.690
She's a girl from Chicago I used to know.
She's very excited I know you.

47:40.524 --> 47:42.276
-Good of her, I'm sure.
-[chuckles]

47:44.736 --> 47:47.072
[Hugh] Can you spot
my wayward wife in the throng?

47:48.991 --> 47:51.535
Ah, yes!

47:51.618 --> 47:53.579
Ah. The usual problem.

47:53.662 --> 47:57.541
All these gentlemen of color have driven
a mere Nordic out of her mind.

47:57.624 --> 47:58.458
[Irene] Stop!

47:58.542 --> 48:01.795
Have I laid eyes on her tonight
except in spots here and there

48:01.879 --> 48:03.839
being twirled about by some Ethiopian?

48:03.922 --> 48:05.132
I have not.

48:05.215 --> 48:08.093
Well, sir, you have to admit
that the average colored man

48:08.176 --> 48:09.928
is a better dancer than the average white.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.389
That is if the celebrities
who find their way up here

48:12.472 --> 48:14.224
are fair specimens of your sort.

48:14.308 --> 48:18.020
Having not tripped the light fantastic
with any of the males,

48:18.103 --> 48:20.689
I am hardly in a position
to argue the point.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.280
[crowd applauding]

48:28.363 --> 48:31.450
[Hugh] Bianca and Co. are always raving on

48:31.533 --> 48:36.705
about the good looks of some Negro,
especially an unusually dark one.

48:36.788 --> 48:38.373
Like Ralph Hazelton there.

48:38.457 --> 48:42.628
Dozens of women
have declared him fantastically handsome.

48:42.711 --> 48:44.171
What do you think? Is he?

48:44.254 --> 48:47.507
No. And I don't think
anyone else would either.

48:48.091 --> 48:52.012
It's just plain exoticism.
An interest in what's different.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.181
A kind of emotional excitement…

48:55.098 --> 48:58.018
Something you feel in the presence
of something strange

48:58.769 --> 49:00.896
and, even perhaps, a bit repugnant to you.

49:00.979 --> 49:02.105
And there you have it.

49:05.901 --> 49:08.195
So, do you subscribe to the notion

49:08.278 --> 49:12.157
that our motives for coming up here
are predatory?

49:12.741 --> 49:13.659
[Irene] No.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.536
More curious, I should say.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.289
Like your princess from Chicago.

49:20.832 --> 49:21.750
[Irene chuckles]

49:23.585 --> 49:25.504
[Hugh] What is that supposed to mean?

49:26.380 --> 49:28.924
Things aren't always what they seem, Hugh.

49:36.181 --> 49:37.349
I'll be damned.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.603
-Nobody could tell from looking at her.
-[Hugh] No.

49:42.938 --> 49:44.231
Most surprising.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.193
Tell me,
can you always tell the difference?

49:48.276 --> 49:51.530
-Oh, now you really are sounding ignorant.
-No, no, I mean it.

49:52.864 --> 49:55.283
Feelings of kinship
or something like that?

49:55.367 --> 49:58.954
Stop talking to me like you're writing
for the National Geographic.

49:59.037 --> 50:00.455
I can tell same as you.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.543
And I suppose sometimes there is a…

50:05.043 --> 50:07.379
a thing… a thing that can't be registered.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.674
[Hugh] Yes, I understand what you mean.

50:11.717 --> 50:15.345
Yet, lots of people pass all the time.

50:15.429 --> 50:17.472
It's easy for a Negro to pass for white.

50:17.556 --> 50:21.393
I'm not sure it would be so simple
for a white person to pass for colored.

50:23.103 --> 50:24.354
Never thought of that.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.607
No, Hugh. Why should you?

50:28.567 --> 50:30.193
Sometimes I think you could.

50:31.319 --> 50:32.446
Yes.

50:33.238 --> 50:35.615
And in a way, if you can,
why wouldn't you?

50:35.699 --> 50:37.576
Sorry. Hey.

50:37.659 --> 50:40.954
-[Hugh] I'm asking, why wouldn't you?
-Who's to say I'm not?

50:41.038 --> 50:45.167
-You're being unusually cryptic this--
-And you are being an ass.

50:46.835 --> 50:47.961
I just mean…

50:48.795 --> 50:51.339
we're all of us passing
for something or other.

50:55.677 --> 50:56.887
Aren't we?

50:56.970 --> 50:58.597
[guests applaud]

50:58.680 --> 51:00.057
An ass, am I?

51:01.349 --> 51:05.270
Ah, my feet hurt
like a… a marathon runner's.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.648
I am in awe of your energy! [chuckles]

51:08.732 --> 51:11.151
Well, I suppose
I ought to go retrieve my wife

51:11.234 --> 51:14.905
before some man or other
steals her away from me indefinitely.

51:14.988 --> 51:17.074
Won't you dance with me, Mr. Wentworth?

51:17.657 --> 51:20.577
It's not quite my strong suit, Ms. Bellew.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.413
-[Brian] Hugh.
-Brian.

51:26.500 --> 51:28.710
-Thank you.
-And for you.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.880
-Thank you.
-Your husband has ruined me, Rene.

51:31.963 --> 51:34.633
I must have another dance with him.
He's the best here!

51:34.716 --> 51:39.763
[chuckles] I guess my wife hasn't told you
that I do not respond well to flattery.

51:39.846 --> 51:42.808
Uh, however, I would be more than happy

51:42.891 --> 51:45.727
to find you a suitable replacement.

51:45.811 --> 51:46.895
-[Irene] Oh.
-[Brian] Mmm.

51:46.978 --> 51:49.147
[upbeat jazz music continues playing]

52:31.231 --> 52:33.900
Now, this… this is your man.

52:34.609 --> 52:35.944
-[man] You?
-[Clare] Yeah.

52:37.279 --> 52:38.822
You'll do. Come along.

52:39.614 --> 52:43.201
-[man] See ya.
-[Irene laughs] He doesn't stand a chance.

52:43.285 --> 52:44.619
[Brian] None whatsoever.

52:45.745 --> 52:46.663
Oh!

52:47.247 --> 52:50.041
You know, I'm rather glad she came.

52:53.712 --> 52:56.131
Isn't she
extraordinarily beautiful, though?

52:56.214 --> 52:57.841
No, not particularly.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.719
-You're fooling!
-No.

53:00.802 --> 53:05.348
I mean, she'd be a rather unusually
good-looking white woman, I suppose.

53:06.391 --> 53:09.728
But personally, I like my women darker.

53:10.729 --> 53:11.855
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.780
Maybe it's just because she was so happy.

53:22.240 --> 53:23.074
Shh.

53:28.914 --> 53:30.081
Irene, watch yourself.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.167
Mmm?

53:32.250 --> 53:35.253
Don't find yourself responsible
for that kind of happiness.

53:35.837 --> 53:38.131
[chuckles] Nonsense.

53:44.387 --> 53:45.847
[jazz trumpet music playing]

53:51.436 --> 53:52.687
[man] Hey, can it!

53:52.771 --> 53:55.148
[trumpet continues playing, fades]

53:55.232 --> 53:57.234
[birds singing]

53:59.319 --> 54:00.987
[jazz piano music playing]

54:11.706 --> 54:12.958
[clock chiming]

54:35.522 --> 54:38.441
[door opens, closes]

54:39.651 --> 54:40.568
[Junior] Clare?

54:41.903 --> 54:43.405
[Ted] Goin' back to bed, Mama?

54:44.447 --> 54:45.949
No, of course not, sweetie.

54:47.784 --> 54:51.246
-Where's Clare?
-She's coming later when you'll be in bed.

54:51.329 --> 54:54.666
-But she sends you special kisses.
-But Pa said she'd play with me.

54:56.167 --> 54:58.962
Ted, take your brother to the kitchen
and get something to eat.

54:59.045 --> 55:00.505
I don't want something to eat.

55:00.588 --> 55:03.717
-Ted, I said go take your…
-'Scuse me.

55:07.762 --> 55:09.889
Sorry. I told Junior Clare would be here.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.267
[door slams]

55:12.350 --> 55:13.893
What's that about?

55:16.521 --> 55:18.148
Somebody called him a dirty…

55:19.983 --> 55:21.651
you-know-what today.

55:25.822 --> 55:26.865
[Irene gasps]

55:40.337 --> 55:42.881
-[Irene] Zulena?
-Out back, Rene.

55:46.718 --> 55:50.138
What in the world?
Clare, aren't you freezing?

55:50.805 --> 55:53.975
When the Lord brings you
a magical day like this, I say lap it up.

55:54.059 --> 55:55.393
You're crazy.

55:55.477 --> 55:59.022
-Zu, can you help with these groceries?
-They call this an Indian summer.

55:59.105 --> 56:01.358
-An Indian summer?
-Zu.

56:05.612 --> 56:08.531
Zu and I were just talking
about the Charlestons next door.

56:08.615 --> 56:11.242
-That eldest girl is getting so pretty.
-She is.

56:12.243 --> 56:13.995
Ted can barely look at her.

56:19.084 --> 56:23.046
-Puberty makes such a mess of friendships.
-[Zulena] Puberty is a mess!

56:23.129 --> 56:24.923
Amen to that! [chuckles]

56:25.423 --> 56:26.549
I don't know.

56:27.133 --> 56:29.135
You had a lot of friends, as I recall.

56:30.720 --> 56:31.846
I suppose.

56:35.308 --> 56:37.936
Sometimes I wonder
why we weren't better friends.

56:39.104 --> 56:40.563
Oh, we did all right.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.317
I always admired you, though.

56:46.611 --> 56:50.573
You were always so calm
and beautiful in the face of everything.

56:50.657 --> 56:53.076
Me? Come on, now.

56:53.618 --> 56:55.203
You were always the beauty.

56:57.747 --> 56:58.957
Not how I see it.

57:08.299 --> 57:09.426
Staying for dinner?

57:10.093 --> 57:11.052
I can't.

57:11.845 --> 57:13.179
John's coming home.

57:14.889 --> 57:16.683
Oh, I thought next week.

57:17.725 --> 57:19.060
Back early.

57:20.186 --> 57:21.312
Misses me.

57:21.813 --> 57:25.900
Can't say I feel the same.
Wish he'd stay away always. [sighs]

57:26.943 --> 57:29.404
-You mustn't say that.
-Mustn't I?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.620
[sighs]

57:37.704 --> 57:39.497
[jazz piano music playing]

57:51.176 --> 57:52.844
Still coming to bridge?

57:53.386 --> 57:55.638
Heaven forfend I miss the bridge, Rene!

57:56.764 --> 57:57.765
[Irene chuckles]

58:10.653 --> 58:11.821
[clock chiming]

58:26.920 --> 58:29.923
[Irene] "It was dusky inside
and smelled like wood and oil."

58:30.006 --> 58:33.676
"She bumped her head on a light bulb
dangling from the ceiling."

58:33.760 --> 58:35.261
Want to take the next part?

58:36.262 --> 58:39.098
"All that time, the rat steadied the bulb

58:39.182 --> 58:41.935
and pulled the chain,
and light flickered."

58:42.018 --> 58:45.813
There was a lynching in Little Rock.
You hear about that?

58:45.897 --> 58:47.982
-[mouthing] Not now.
-What happened?

58:48.066 --> 58:51.653
A Black man was accused
of assaulting two white women.

58:52.570 --> 58:54.072
What did he do to them?

58:54.155 --> 58:57.242
It's less a question
of "what" than "if," Ted.

58:57.325 --> 58:59.786
-But they lynched the man anyway.
-Exactly.

58:59.869 --> 59:01.204
Junior, go brush your teeth.

59:02.372 --> 59:03.206
They…

59:04.707 --> 59:05.792
-chased him…
-Brian.

59:05.875 --> 59:09.337
They caught him, hung him from
a telephone pole, and they shot him.

59:10.171 --> 59:13.132
-But why, Papa?
-Because they hate us, son.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.677
I said, Brian, not now.

59:20.515 --> 59:21.474
Come here.

59:23.059 --> 59:26.437
Seems as though
we can't discuss these things

59:26.521 --> 59:28.856
without distressing
the ladies of our family.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.818
[Junior and Brian laughing]

59:32.485 --> 59:33.987
-All right?
-Yeah.

59:34.779 --> 59:36.114
Go brush those teeth, hmm?

59:49.127 --> 59:51.963
[Irene] I know I take being a mother
rather seriously.

59:52.797 --> 59:55.925
I know I'm wrapped up in my boys
and the running of my house.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.595
But I don't think
there's anything funny in that.

59:58.678 --> 59:59.762
[Clare] Oh, Rene, I know.

1:00:00.471 --> 1:00:03.141
You're so good. So perfect.

1:00:04.183 --> 1:00:06.394
You say that like it's a bad thing.

1:00:06.477 --> 1:00:08.229
[trumpet playing in distance]

1:00:11.274 --> 1:00:12.817
Let's sit here a minute.

1:00:14.986 --> 1:00:16.613
I like hearing him play.

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:41.429
Don't think, whatever happens,
I'll forget how good you've been to me.

1:00:43.181 --> 1:00:45.266
-What are you talking about?
-I mean it.

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:49.937
You see, I…

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:56.027
I don't have proper morals
or a sense of duty like you.

1:00:57.487 --> 1:01:00.573
-You're talking nonsense.
-But it's true, Rene.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.204
Don't you realize?

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:10.750
I'm not like you one bit.

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:23.012
Why, to get the things
I want so badly, I'd do anything.

1:01:24.514 --> 1:01:25.765
Hurt anybody.

1:01:29.352 --> 1:01:30.895
Throw anything away.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:33.898
Anything.

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:40.697
I'm not safe.

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:42.448
[trumpet continues playing]

1:01:53.126 --> 1:01:55.253
Clare, stop it.

1:01:55.962 --> 1:01:57.797
What you're saying is wrong.

1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:00.675
You've always had so much,
you haven't given up a thing.

1:02:02.802 --> 1:02:04.262
[trumpet stops playing]

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:14.230
Clare?

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:25.992
[Irene sobbing]

1:02:34.876 --> 1:02:36.544
[doorbell chimes]

1:02:40.298 --> 1:02:41.924
[indistinct whispering]

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:48.014
[Irene] Oh, I'm sorry.

1:02:50.266 --> 1:02:51.642
Has Mae called?

1:02:51.726 --> 1:02:54.103
[sighs] I don't know where she could be.

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:56.898
Damn Zu taking the night off…

1:02:56.981 --> 1:02:59.275
She does have to see her family
from time to time.

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:05.823
Oh, but, we're late already and…

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.994
Well, it is my last night
before I leave for Europe.

1:03:14.373 --> 1:03:17.794
Why don't I stay with the boys
and you two go?

1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:19.796
-[Brian] Really?
-I don't mind.

1:03:20.588 --> 1:03:23.174
-No, we can't leave you.
-Oh, yes, you can.

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:26.385
And it will make the numbers even.

1:03:30.473 --> 1:03:33.100
Well, now I really have to play bridge.

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:43.694
-Go on, now.
-But I'll miss you, Rene.

1:03:43.778 --> 1:03:47.073
No, you won't. Go on. Get.

1:03:55.122 --> 1:03:56.082
Go on, now.

1:04:03.422 --> 1:04:05.216
[clock ticking]

1:04:07.426 --> 1:04:09.303
[playing upbeat jazz music]

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.793
[crowd cheering]

1:04:43.880 --> 1:04:45.673
This is where all the talent is.

1:04:46.340 --> 1:04:48.593
-[Hugh] Yeah, and the hooch.
-[Irene laughs]

1:04:48.676 --> 1:04:50.052
Where's Princess tonight?

1:04:50.136 --> 1:04:52.847
It's a rarity having the two of you
all to myself.

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:55.433
She's in Europe.

1:04:55.516 --> 1:04:58.978
Her daughter's in boarding school.
Switzerland, of all places.

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:01.105
[both chuckle]

1:05:02.565 --> 1:05:04.901
-What?
-Nothing. Just, uh…

1:05:05.776 --> 1:05:08.070
What do you know about Switzerland?

1:05:09.947 --> 1:05:13.951
Well, I shouldn't miss her too much.
I find her hard work.

1:05:14.035 --> 1:05:15.995
Well, some would say the same of you.

1:05:16.579 --> 1:05:17.747
True.

1:05:17.830 --> 1:05:23.044
But I call it shameless, what she does.
Always playing the victim.

1:05:23.127 --> 1:05:24.837
"Poor little tragic me," etcetera…

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.797
It's a low way
of making yourself popular--

1:05:26.881 --> 1:05:29.467
-I don't think that's fair.
-I didn't quite finish.

1:05:32.136 --> 1:05:35.514
But she does maintain a certain charm.

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:38.726
Hugh, you hardly know the woman.

1:05:38.809 --> 1:05:41.687
-Since she isn't here to defend herself--
-You will?

1:05:43.522 --> 1:05:45.399
Very chivalrous of you, I'm sure.

1:05:46.233 --> 1:05:48.027
[lively jazz music playing]

1:05:52.448 --> 1:05:54.283
[Irene chuckles]

1:05:58.663 --> 1:06:01.624
-[birds singing]
-[children playing in distance]

1:06:02.667 --> 1:06:04.710
[jazz piano music playing]

1:06:08.297 --> 1:06:09.966
-[Irene] Afternoon, Lance.
-Irene.

1:06:57.680 --> 1:07:00.391
Have to let this dry before we attach it.

1:07:06.313 --> 1:07:09.150
This is nice, isn't it? Just us four.

1:07:15.239 --> 1:07:17.491
-I'll make some hot chocolate.
-Yes, please!

1:07:19.785 --> 1:07:20.870
Look out!

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:33.174
[Ted] No, I want to keep talking about it.

1:07:33.257 --> 1:07:36.427
-[Irene] You two look serious.
-We're talking about John Carter.

1:07:37.803 --> 1:07:40.139
The one that got lynched in Little Rock.

1:07:41.057 --> 1:07:43.809
-That again?
-[Ted] You gotta know about these things.

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:46.312
-Do I?
-Do we have any more nuts?

1:07:46.979 --> 1:07:48.731
-I'll see.
-I want some too.

1:07:50.232 --> 1:07:52.568
You know they did more
than just shoot him.

1:07:52.651 --> 1:07:56.072
They attached his body to a caravan,
dragged it through the city.

1:07:57.865 --> 1:08:00.659
-Did you tell your father that?
-He told me.

1:08:01.744 --> 1:08:02.953
He did?

1:08:05.623 --> 1:08:08.751
I'm old enough not to be spoken to
like a child anymore.

1:08:12.129 --> 1:08:13.422
[pot bubbling loudly]

1:08:13.506 --> 1:08:14.548
[Irene sighs]

1:08:18.010 --> 1:08:19.678
[Junior] Thank you for dinner, Mama.

1:08:31.357 --> 1:08:35.027
I wish you wouldn't keep talking to them
about all that lynching stuff.

1:08:35.111 --> 1:08:36.195
Why?

1:08:36.278 --> 1:08:40.116
There'll be time for them to learn
about horrible things when they're older.

1:08:40.741 --> 1:08:43.244
-Right now, they're safe.
-You are absolutely wrong.

1:08:43.744 --> 1:08:46.705
If you are determined
to have them grow up in this damn country,

1:08:46.789 --> 1:08:48.999
the sooner they find out, the better.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:52.002
But they're happy. Why ruin that?

1:08:52.795 --> 1:08:54.922
-I want them to stay happy.
-Irene.

1:08:55.923 --> 1:08:59.885
What is the use
in keeping things from them? Hmm?

1:09:00.678 --> 1:09:03.180
We tried to keep them
from hearing the word "nigger."

1:09:03.264 --> 1:09:05.224
-Don't use those--
-They found out the hard way.

1:09:05.307 --> 1:09:07.977
You are not to talk
about the race problem. I won't have it.

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:11.105
-It is my house too. They need to know--
-They don't!

1:09:13.899 --> 1:09:14.942
They do not.

1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:24.577
I don't understand how someone
as intelligent as you can be so stupid.

1:09:28.831 --> 1:09:30.207
[crying softly]

1:09:48.350 --> 1:09:50.769
I wanted to leave
this hellish place years ago.

1:09:53.272 --> 1:09:57.318
I have been saying
we should go away for a bit.

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:05.618
But then you seemed happier
having Clare around, so…

1:10:06.452 --> 1:10:08.204
The hell has Clare got to do with--

1:10:08.287 --> 1:10:10.664
Only that we would have
gone on a trip but for that.

1:10:10.748 --> 1:10:12.833
I gave up that idea because you objected…

1:10:12.917 --> 1:10:15.419
-I never objected to having Clare--
-God damn it!

1:10:16.045 --> 1:10:18.422
Irene, I'm not talking about Clare.

1:10:18.505 --> 1:10:20.341
-It seems--
-I'm not talking about a trip!

1:10:20.424 --> 1:10:22.176
I am talking about leaving this--

1:10:22.259 --> 1:10:27.014
It seems to me you are a lot less content
with what you've got when she's not here.

1:10:39.151 --> 1:10:40.778
[dishes clattering]

1:10:52.831 --> 1:10:54.083
[continues crying]

1:11:01.340 --> 1:11:02.466
[indistinct chatter]

1:11:03.842 --> 1:11:04.885
[footsteps running]

1:11:14.270 --> 1:11:16.272
[gentle piano music playing]

1:11:30.995 --> 1:11:32.288
[train engine chugging]

1:11:44.383 --> 1:11:45.426
[Clare giggling]

1:11:56.895 --> 1:11:58.564
[jazz piano music playing]

1:12:14.038 --> 1:12:17.041
[Clare] Not how I see it. No.

1:12:21.628 --> 1:12:23.047
[indistinct chatter echoing]

1:12:26.967 --> 1:12:29.136
[indistinct laughter echoing]

1:12:58.957 --> 1:12:59.792
[giggles]

1:13:02.294 --> 1:13:03.712
I'm getting up.

1:13:05.005 --> 1:13:06.006
Don't worry.

1:13:07.966 --> 1:13:08.801
Hmm.

1:13:12.221 --> 1:13:15.808
-It was good of you to think to call me.
-Always the attentive husband.

1:13:15.891 --> 1:13:17.059
[Irene sighs]

1:13:17.142 --> 1:13:18.977
All of those people coming to tea.

1:13:21.271 --> 1:13:23.273
Thank goodness everything is ready.

1:13:26.110 --> 1:13:29.279
-Clare's downstairs.
-Clare? How?

1:13:29.363 --> 1:13:31.365
I didn't invite her, purposely.

1:13:31.865 --> 1:13:35.577
Uh, she's been back for a while.
Zu's always taking messages,

1:13:35.661 --> 1:13:38.038
and you never seem to respond.

1:13:38.122 --> 1:13:39.790
Might a mere man ask why?

1:13:41.291 --> 1:13:45.212
This party is for Hugh, and Hugh happens
not to care a great deal for her, so…

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:47.631
I didn't ask her.

1:13:47.714 --> 1:13:50.801
If you ask me, his dislike
has less to do with her

1:13:50.884 --> 1:13:55.764
and more to do with the attention
she happens to not give him very much of.

1:13:56.348 --> 1:13:58.058
-You love Hugh.
-I do.

1:13:58.142 --> 1:14:00.936
But you'll admit he has
a godlike opinion of himself.

1:14:01.019 --> 1:14:02.187
I disagree.

1:14:02.271 --> 1:14:05.858
He thinks far better of himself
than that. [giggles]

1:14:33.177 --> 1:14:34.344
Brian?

1:14:36.013 --> 1:14:37.764
I'm sorry. It's my fault, Irene.

1:14:38.849 --> 1:14:42.811
She seemed hurt at being left out.
I told her I was sure you'd forgotten.

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.360
But, Brian, I…

1:14:57.493 --> 1:14:58.869
You spoke to her, then?

1:15:00.579 --> 1:15:01.413
Yes.

1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:04.500
Of course you did.

1:15:15.385 --> 1:15:18.263
In spite of what I said,
Clare does add to any party.

1:15:21.183 --> 1:15:22.809
She's so easy on the eyes.

1:15:25.187 --> 1:15:26.271
[sighs]

1:15:27.940 --> 1:15:28.982
You won't be long?

1:15:34.821 --> 1:15:36.448
[breathing heavily]

1:15:44.957 --> 1:15:46.667
[indistinct chatter]

1:15:48.961 --> 1:15:51.088
-[woman 1] Thank you.
-[Irene] Sorry.

1:15:52.005 --> 1:15:55.217
[woman 2] We're all discussing
La Josephine. You've seen her, I presume?

1:15:55.300 --> 1:15:58.762
-[Irene] Josephine Baker? No, never.
-[man] You're missing out.

1:15:59.930 --> 1:16:02.474
[Irene] She may have been
in Shuffle Along when I saw it,

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:05.894
but I can't remember.

1:16:05.978 --> 1:16:07.938
[woman 2] I much prefer her
to Ethel Waters.

1:16:08.021 --> 1:16:10.524
[Irene] Ethel Waters is awfully good.

1:16:12.401 --> 1:16:14.152
Hello, Felise, so glad you made it.

1:16:14.861 --> 1:16:16.655
[Felise] Oh, come back. Irene.

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:20.492
-You haven't sat down all afternoon.
-[Irene breathing heavily]

1:16:21.201 --> 1:16:22.744
[Felise] I wanna talk to you.

1:16:27.624 --> 1:16:31.378
Come out of it, whatever it is.
You look like the second gravedigger.

1:16:31.461 --> 1:16:33.422
[Irene] I'm not quite feeling up to par.

1:16:34.590 --> 1:16:38.010
-The weather, I guess.
-[Felise] Buy yourself an expensive frock.

1:16:38.093 --> 1:16:39.344
It always helps.

1:16:39.428 --> 1:16:43.056
I have been trying to get her alone
all afternoon. Clare!

1:16:44.933 --> 1:16:47.477
You look too divine,
sitting so quiet like a painting!

1:16:47.561 --> 1:16:49.730
-Come over for a gathering next month.
-You must!

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:52.274
[Clare] I was telling Dave
I just finished his book.

1:16:52.357 --> 1:16:55.277
-[Felise] You've read his books?
-Of course, I've read all of 'em!

1:16:56.945 --> 1:16:57.863
[Hugh] Oh.

1:16:59.156 --> 1:17:03.452
So sorry, Rene, I must've pushed you.
Clumsy of me.

1:17:05.412 --> 1:17:09.124
Don't tell me,
it's priceless and irreplaceable?

1:17:09.207 --> 1:17:12.044
No, you didn't push me, I'm quite sure.

1:17:13.211 --> 1:17:15.881
That pot was the ugliest thing

1:17:15.964 --> 1:17:19.051
that your ancestors,
the charming Confederates, ever owned.

1:17:19.134 --> 1:17:21.845
I've forgotten how many
thousands of years ago it was

1:17:21.928 --> 1:17:25.849
that Brian's
great-great-great-great uncle owned it…

1:17:25.932 --> 1:17:30.562
What I mean is I never figured out how
to get rid of it till just this minute.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:34.024
Inspiration! I had only to break it,
and I was free of it forever.

1:17:34.524 --> 1:17:37.527
-[chuckles] Simple.
-Well done.

1:17:41.156 --> 1:17:43.909
-[Hugh] My lovely.
-[woman] Oh, that was wonderful.

1:17:45.994 --> 1:17:47.079
Well done.

1:17:48.455 --> 1:17:51.500
Brian, thank you so much
for a tea party that…

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:53.460
-Bye, Rene.
-…can never be matched.

1:17:53.543 --> 1:17:55.629
-Staying for dinner?
-Oh, I can't tonight.

1:17:55.712 --> 1:17:59.549
Oh. Right.
Too bad. Brian's got work, anyway.

1:17:59.633 --> 1:18:01.426
-So glad to see you.
-So long.

1:18:03.970 --> 1:18:06.682
Thank you so much.
We had a marvelous time.

1:18:06.765 --> 1:18:08.392
Good to see you. Thank you.

1:18:09.226 --> 1:18:11.061
[clock chiming]

1:18:13.522 --> 1:18:14.481
[door opens]

1:18:14.564 --> 1:18:17.651
-[Junior] Then I beat Patrick in a race.
-[Brian] Hat! Hat!

1:18:17.734 --> 1:18:19.945
Race you up the steps! Can't catch me.

1:18:20.028 --> 1:18:22.406
[Ted] I'm not letting you have it. No!

1:18:25.033 --> 1:18:25.867
Evening.

1:18:31.748 --> 1:18:33.500
[bell ringing]

1:18:33.583 --> 1:18:34.751
[Felise] My goodness.

1:18:36.211 --> 1:18:40.173
-Heavens, my eyes are watering.
-I fear my fingers might fall off.

1:18:40.257 --> 1:18:41.800
-[giggling]
-This wind is brutal!

1:18:43.009 --> 1:18:43.844
[John] Excuse me.

1:18:45.137 --> 1:18:48.557
Oh, Mrs. Redfield! How do you do?

1:19:08.535 --> 1:19:09.661
That was abrupt.

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:15.000
You just passed the only person I ever met
while disguised as a white woman.

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.752
[jazz piano music playing]

1:19:43.904 --> 1:19:46.114
Hello, Central Quincy 5-4-7-3.

1:19:49.534 --> 1:19:52.913
Hello, is Mrs. Bellew in? It's urgent.

1:19:57.209 --> 1:19:58.043
No?

1:20:04.007 --> 1:20:04.966
Never mind.

1:20:08.762 --> 1:20:10.013
It isn't that urgent.

1:20:11.389 --> 1:20:12.557
I'll try again later.

1:20:12.641 --> 1:20:14.643
[wind whistling]

1:21:05.986 --> 1:21:07.571
[wind continues blowing]

1:21:12.742 --> 1:21:14.536
[jazz piano music playing]

1:21:33.763 --> 1:21:35.181
[breathing heavily]

1:21:39.561 --> 1:21:41.855
[trumpet playing in distance]

1:22:05.170 --> 1:22:06.546
[Brian] Irene.

1:22:08.882 --> 1:22:09.716
Irene.

1:22:13.219 --> 1:22:14.930
What are you doing? It's freezing.

1:22:16.431 --> 1:22:18.516
Are we going to that party with Clare?

1:22:30.987 --> 1:22:32.405
[Clare giggling]

1:22:34.783 --> 1:22:35.742
[Brian chuckling]

1:22:36.701 --> 1:22:39.496
Have you ever been up to the sixth floor?

1:22:39.579 --> 1:22:43.500
[Clare] Of course!
My father was a janitor.

1:22:43.583 --> 1:22:44.501
[chuckles]

1:22:45.210 --> 1:22:46.378
[Clare] Back in the old days

1:22:46.461 --> 1:22:49.923
when every ramshackle apartment
had its own elevator.

1:22:50.006 --> 1:22:51.007
[Brian] Elevator?

1:22:51.841 --> 1:22:56.680
-Oh, you can't mean we have to walk up?
-[chuckles] All the way to the top.

1:22:56.763 --> 1:22:58.264
[Clare] Oh, Lord!

1:22:58.890 --> 1:23:01.101
Why on earth would anyone live here?

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:04.396
She says it discourages
the casual visitor.

1:23:04.479 --> 1:23:07.107
-Says she'd rather be dead than bored!
-Huh.

1:23:08.608 --> 1:23:09.651
[Clare sighs]

1:23:10.902 --> 1:23:12.862
Damn these thin shoes.

1:23:16.825 --> 1:23:17.909
What is it, Rene?

1:23:20.495 --> 1:23:23.415
Have you ever thought of what you'd do
if John found out?

1:23:24.082 --> 1:23:24.916
Yes.

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.253
[Brian] Don't fall by the wayside
before the fourth floor.

1:23:28.336 --> 1:23:31.506
I absolutely refuse to carry anybody up
more than two flights.

1:23:33.508 --> 1:23:34.676
[Clare giggling]

1:23:36.678 --> 1:23:39.264
And? What would you?

1:23:40.932 --> 1:23:43.560
I'd do what I want
more than anything right now.

1:23:44.686 --> 1:23:46.187
I'd come up here to live.

1:23:47.063 --> 1:23:49.399
In Harlem. With you.

1:23:59.159 --> 1:24:00.660
[Brian chuckling]

1:24:09.878 --> 1:24:10.754
Lord.

1:24:11.629 --> 1:24:13.548
[Brian and Clare breathing heavily]

1:24:31.691 --> 1:24:33.026
Come on, slowpoke.

1:24:35.236 --> 1:24:36.362
[indistinct chatter]

1:24:44.245 --> 1:24:47.415
[Dave] …dinner at Eddie's,
then Leroy's, then Smalls.

1:24:48.083 --> 1:24:50.168
Those dancers seem strange to anyone else?

1:24:50.251 --> 1:24:53.171
-No, honey, just the liquor.
-That's why I've given it up.

1:24:53.254 --> 1:24:54.923
-Since this morning?
-Yes.

1:24:55.590 --> 1:24:57.717
And nothing in the least exciting
has happened--

1:24:57.801 --> 1:24:59.844
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

1:24:59.928 --> 1:25:02.514
I wouldn't.
I've heard the drinks here aren't safe.

1:25:02.597 --> 1:25:04.390
[indistinct chatter continues]

1:25:06.726 --> 1:25:10.814
[Dave] Irene, have you taken a vow
not to laugh again?

1:25:11.356 --> 1:25:15.568
No. It's simply the rest of you
are so clever, I'm speechless.

1:25:15.652 --> 1:25:17.654
You haven't a drink. What will you take?

1:25:18.738 --> 1:25:20.323
Ginger ale and three drams of scotch.

1:25:20.406 --> 1:25:22.659
Scotch first, then the ice,
then the ginger ale.

1:25:23.159 --> 1:25:26.079
[Felise] Don't attempt
to mix that yourself, Dave, honey.

1:25:26.162 --> 1:25:29.082
-Have the butler make it.
-[Irene] And the footman, would you?

1:25:49.477 --> 1:25:51.437
[soft jazz music playing]

1:26:37.358 --> 1:26:41.029
-Yes, it's a perfect evening.
-Good.

1:26:54.167 --> 1:26:57.337
[Dave] Don't stand there.
Aren't you freezing?

1:26:57.420 --> 1:26:58.671
[pounding on door]

1:26:58.755 --> 1:27:03.051
[Dave] Come. Come talk to me,
or at least listen to me gabble.

1:27:04.052 --> 1:27:06.054
-[man 1] Evening, can I help you?
-[John] Let me in.

1:27:07.639 --> 1:27:09.557
[man 1] Perhaps
you've come to the wrong house.

1:27:09.641 --> 1:27:11.684
[John] I know where I am. Let me in.

1:27:11.768 --> 1:27:13.895
[man 2] Which apartment
are you looking for, sir?

1:27:13.978 --> 1:27:16.064
-[John] My wife is in there.
-[man 1] Your wife?

1:27:16.147 --> 1:27:18.816
No, sir, she's not here. I guarantee it.

1:27:19.525 --> 1:27:22.487
-[man 2] Excuse me, I think you're wrong.
-[John] I'm not wrong.

1:27:22.570 --> 1:27:24.697
-[man 1] Do not come in!
-[man 2] Sir, calm down.

1:27:24.781 --> 1:27:26.658
-[man 3] What's going on?
-[John] Out of my way.

1:27:26.741 --> 1:27:27.575
Can I help you?

1:27:29.369 --> 1:27:32.121
[John] I've been to the Redfields'
and I know she's with them.

1:27:32.205 --> 1:27:33.456
Ralph, where's my drink?

1:27:40.421 --> 1:27:43.174
[John] Save yourself the trouble
and get out of my way.

1:27:44.300 --> 1:27:46.970
I know what you're doing here. I know.

1:27:48.930 --> 1:27:51.140
I'm Redfield.
What the devil's the matter--

1:27:51.224 --> 1:27:53.935
You don't get to tell me what to do!
Any of you people!

1:27:54.018 --> 1:27:55.270
[Dave] It's best you leave.

1:27:55.353 --> 1:27:56.813
You liar!

1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.400
[Felise] Careful.
You're the only white man here.

1:28:02.527 --> 1:28:05.863
You dirty liar.

1:28:14.998 --> 1:28:16.666
[gasps]

1:28:22.297 --> 1:28:23.423
[Felise] Oh!

1:28:26.259 --> 1:28:27.885
-Good Lord Jesus!
-[indistinct chatter]

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:30.555
-[man 1] Hurry.
-[man 2] Quickly!

1:28:32.515 --> 1:28:33.349
Quickly!

1:28:35.893 --> 1:28:36.978
Go downstairs.

1:28:43.443 --> 1:28:45.445
[wind whistling]

1:29:53.304 --> 1:29:54.972
[man 1] Her husband's just sitting there?

1:29:56.766 --> 1:29:57.767
[man 2] I don't know.

1:29:58.810 --> 1:30:00.311
[man 1] You don't know?

1:30:00.395 --> 1:30:02.397
[man 2] I don't know
for sure if she's dead.

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:04.482
[high-pitched ringing]

1:30:06.192 --> 1:30:08.444
[ambulance sirens blaring]

1:30:11.948 --> 1:30:14.283
[man 3] I imagine he was
just trying to protect his wife.

1:30:14.367 --> 1:30:16.452
[man 4] Doesn't strike me
as particularly unusual.

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:21.958
[Irene] Is she…

1:30:25.920 --> 1:30:26.838
Is she…

1:30:44.689 --> 1:30:45.565
[moans]

1:30:47.316 --> 1:30:48.401
Irene, you mustn't.

1:30:49.694 --> 1:30:51.112
You'll make yourself sick.

1:30:51.195 --> 1:30:55.116
[man 3] I mean, she just tumbled over
and was gone.

1:30:55.199 --> 1:30:56.993
[Dave] Irene was there
beside her, weren't you?

1:30:57.076 --> 1:30:58.161
[officer] This lady here?

1:30:59.454 --> 1:31:00.413
You're sure she fell?

1:31:00.496 --> 1:31:02.790
Her husband
didn't give her a shove or anything,

1:31:02.874 --> 1:31:05.001
as Dr. Redfield here seems to think?

1:31:06.085 --> 1:31:09.672
No. I'm quite sure she just fell
before anyone could stop her.

1:31:09.755 --> 1:31:11.090
It was so quick, I…

1:31:13.217 --> 1:31:14.093
[gagging]

1:31:14.177 --> 1:31:16.929
-Careful.
-[officer] Anyone else notice anything?

1:31:17.013 --> 1:31:19.056
-You mustn't.
-[officer] None of you saw how she fell?

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:23.394
-[Felise] He was upset, that's true.
-[officer] So an accident?

1:31:24.145 --> 1:31:27.565
[Felise] I guess an accident, yeah.

1:31:28.316 --> 1:31:29.484
That's what I thought.

1:31:29.567 --> 1:31:31.944
[breath trembling]

1:32:15.321 --> 1:32:16.447
[whispers] I love you.

1:32:20.243 --> 1:32:22.453
[officer] Death by misadventure,
I'm inclined to believe.

1:32:22.537 --> 1:32:24.830
Let's go up
and have a look at that window.

1:32:28.834 --> 1:32:30.836
[wind blowing]

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:43.474
[somber piano music playing]
