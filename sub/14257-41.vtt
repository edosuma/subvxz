01:09.643 --> 01:11.310
OK, DUDE,

01:11.311 --> 01:14.311
HERE'S WHERE I WHIP
YOUR SHELL BUT GOOD.

01:14.312 --> 01:16.611
YEAH, YOU AND WHAT ARMY?

01:16.612 --> 01:19.313
THEY COMPETE
AS INTENSELY
IN THIS GAME

01:19.314 --> 01:21.613
AS THEY DO
IN THEIR
NINJA BOUTS.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.281
I'M NOT AT ALL
SURPRISED.

01:23.282 --> 01:24.781
THE LOSER
PAYS FOR THE PIZZAS.

01:24.782 --> 01:27.349
LEONARDO HERE.

01:27.350 --> 01:28.650
WHAT'S UP, APRIL?

01:28.651 --> 01:30.584
THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING
YOU CAN TELL ME.

01:30.585 --> 01:32.818
QUICK, TURN ON
CHANNEL 6.

01:35.221 --> 01:37.353
HEY, WE'RE
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A GAME!

01:37.354 --> 01:40.787
SORRY, GUYS, BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE AN EMERGENCY.

01:40.788 --> 01:44.255
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
LIVE FROM MIDTOWN,

01:44.256 --> 01:46.991
WHERE THIS STRANGE
WHIRLWIND PHENOMENON

01:46.992 --> 01:49.691
APPEARED IN THE SKY
JUST MOMENTS AGO.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.025
THAT'S NO WHIRLWIND!

01:51.026 --> 01:53.360
IT LOOKS LIKE A PORTAL
TO DIMENSION X.

01:53.361 --> 01:54.760
OH, GREAT.

01:54.761 --> 01:57.227
WHAT GENIUS LEFT
THAT WINDOW OPEN?

01:57.228 --> 01:59.129
WE KNOW IT COULDN'T BE
KRANG AND SHREDDER.

01:59.130 --> 02:00.862
THEY'RE ALREADY
HERE ON EARTH.

02:00.863 --> 02:03.531
THEN AGAIN,
IT MIGHT JUST BE
AN ACCIDENTAL TEAR

02:03.532 --> 02:05.664
IN THE FABRIC
OF SPACE/TIME.

02:05.665 --> 02:08.865
WELL, I DON'T SUPPOSE
A REALLY GOOD TAILOR
WOULD HELP?

02:08.866 --> 02:10.866
WELL, NO MATTER
HOW IT HAPPENED,

02:10.866 --> 02:12.900
IT'S UP TO US
TO DO SOMETHING.

02:12.901 --> 02:14.568
LET'S GO, FELLAS.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.502
GOOD LUCK, TURTLES.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.503
KEEP THE CAMERA
ON THAT THING.

02:19.504 --> 02:22.137
ANYTHING MIGHT
COME OUT OF THAT HOLE
IN THE SKY.

02:22.138 --> 02:25.306
DID YOU SAY, "ANYTHING"?

02:25.307 --> 02:27.640
THAT'S RIGHT, VERNON,
ANYTHING.

02:27.641 --> 02:30.407
OH, OH, M-MAYBE
I BETTER CHECK

02:30.408 --> 02:32.241
THE EQUIPMENT
IN THE VAN.

02:35.777 --> 02:37.844
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

02:37.845 --> 02:40.545
OH, DON'T HURT ME,
I BEG OF YOU!

02:40.546 --> 02:42.779
WILL YOU PLEASE
STAND STILL?

02:44.348 --> 02:47.514
HOLY GUACAMOLE,
WHAT IS THAT?

02:47.515 --> 02:50.682
<i>WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S NOW WAS.</i>

02:50.683 --> 02:52.283
LOOK, THE PORTAL.

02:52.284 --> 02:54.985
SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO IT.

02:54.986 --> 02:56.385
IT LOOKS LIKE
THE TEAR

02:56.386 --> 02:58.885
IN THE CONTINUUM
SEALED ITSELF SHUT.

02:58.886 --> 03:03.221
TOTALLY! BUT NOT BEFORE
THAT WEIRDO THINGY
CAME THROUGH IT.

03:03.222 --> 03:05.722
AND WE'D BETTER
FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS.

03:05.723 --> 03:08.457
OH, NO, YOU DON'T, GUYS.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.425
WHATEVER THAT CREATURE
IS, IT'S NEWS.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.859
WAIT! COME BACK
WITH MY HIDING PLACE.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.527
WE'VE GOT A FIX ON IT.

03:17.528 --> 03:18.793
THERE IT GOES!

03:18.794 --> 03:20.162
STAY ON HIS TAIL!

03:23.997 --> 03:26.664
APRIL, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:26.665 --> 03:28.498
CHASING DOWN A BIG STORY.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.232
NOW WHERE IS IT?

03:30.233 --> 03:31.466
SEARCH US.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.400
<i>WE'RE STILL WORKING ON
WHAT IS IT.</i>

03:33.401 --> 03:35.366
IT'S AWFULLY QUIET.

03:35.367 --> 03:37.802
YEAH, TOO QUIET.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.036
NOW, HOW'D
I KNOW HE WAS
GONNA SAY THAT?

03:42.971 --> 03:44.804
CHECK IT OUT, DUDES.

03:44.805 --> 03:46.238
FLYING SAUCER.

03:48.407 --> 03:50.174
LOOK, THERE IT GOES!

03:50.175 --> 03:51.740
LITTLE DUDE,

03:51.741 --> 03:54.341
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE
SHELL-SHOCKED.

03:56.143 --> 03:57.642
HEY, COME BACK HERE!

03:57.643 --> 03:59.377
I STILL GOT
5 MORE PAYMENTS

03:59.378 --> 04:01.478
TO MAKE ON THOSE!

04:04.680 --> 04:08.980
THERE'S SOMETHING
MEGA-BIZARRO GOING ON.

04:10.548 --> 04:13.082
MICHELANGELO,
YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:13.083 --> 04:14.516
TOO WEIRD, DUDE.

04:14.517 --> 04:16.949
MY CHUKS JUST
FREAKED OUT.

04:18.084 --> 04:20.084
OW, OOH, STOP.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.087
YOU THINK ITS TOO LATE
TO ASK FOR OUR MONEY BACK
ON THESE WEAPONS?

04:25.088 --> 04:27.521
LOOK, THERE'S
THAT THING AGAIN.

04:27.522 --> 04:29.255
WE'VE GOT YOU NOW...

04:30.523 --> 04:32.256
WHATEVER YOU ARE.

04:33.492 --> 04:34.691
WHAT?

04:34.692 --> 04:38.259
MONDO MYSTERIOSO, DUDES.

04:42.261 --> 04:44.061
NOW I GET IT.

04:44.062 --> 04:47.095
THIS LITTLE GUY'S
GOT PSYCHOKINETIC
ABILITIES.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.797
PSYCH--
PSYCHOKI...

04:50.798 --> 04:53.798
OH, WHAT'S
THAT MEAN?

04:53.799 --> 04:55.599
WELL, PSYCHOKINETIC
ABILITY MEANS

04:55.600 --> 04:56.866
THE POWER
TO MOVE THINGS

04:56.867 --> 04:58.566
JUST BY THINKING
ABOUT THEM.

05:01.169 --> 05:04.903
IT'S AMAZING! IT CAN
EVEN PICK ITSELF UP.

05:06.171 --> 05:08.771
IT SEEMS
FRIENDLY ENOUGH.

05:08.772 --> 05:11.373
I GUESS IT WAS JUST
PLAYING WITH US.

05:11.374 --> 05:14.007
WELL, SO, LIKE,
WHAT DO WE DO
WITH IT?

05:14.008 --> 05:15.840
WE LOOK AFTER IT
IN THE SEWERS

05:15.841 --> 05:18.008
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT
SOME WAY TO RETURN IT

05:18.009 --> 05:19.676
TO DIMENSION X.

05:19.677 --> 05:22.109
LEONARDO,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

05:22.110 --> 05:25.644
HMM, I WONDER HOW GREAT
AN IDEA IT REALLY IS.

05:27.346 --> 05:29.846
THE SENSOR GAUGE
INDICATES

05:29.847 --> 05:31.780
THAT SOMETHING CAME
THROUGH THE PORTAL

05:31.781 --> 05:34.115
FROM DIMENSION X.

05:34.116 --> 05:38.384
SOMETHING
WITH INCREDIBLE
PSYCHOKINETIC POWERS.

05:38.385 --> 05:40.717
WHAT MANNER OF CREATURE
COULD IT BE?

05:40.718 --> 05:42.884
IT MUST BE A GRYBYX.

05:42.885 --> 05:46.386
THE INHABITANTS
OF DIMENSION X
KEEP THEM AS PETS.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.820
PERSONALLY, I THINK

05:47.821 --> 05:50.088
THEY'RE BOTHERSOME
LITTLE THINGS.

05:50.089 --> 05:52.389
IF WE CAN CAPTURE
THE CREATURE,

05:52.390 --> 05:53.655
WE MIGHT BE ABLE

05:53.656 --> 05:56.257
TO HARNESS ITS
LEVITATIONAL POWERS

05:56.258 --> 05:58.891
TO RAISE
THE TECHNODROME.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.759
SAY NO MORE. I'LL TAKE
BEBOP, ROCKSTEADY
AND SOME FOOT SOLDIERS

06:02.760 --> 06:04.493
AND WE'LL HEAD
FOR THE SURFACE.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.893
THAT GRYBYX
IS AS GOOD AS OURS.

06:09.997 --> 06:12.396
WAY TO GO,
LITTLE GUY.

06:12.397 --> 06:14.030
HE'S SUCH A CUTE
LITTLE THING.

06:14.031 --> 06:16.465
I'LL BE SORRY
TO SEE HIM LEAVE.

06:16.466 --> 06:17.532
SPEAKING OF THAT,

06:17.533 --> 06:20.466
EXACTLY HOW
DO WE GET HIM BACK
TO DIMENSION X?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.800
WE INTERRUPT
THIS PROGRAM

06:21.800 --> 06:24.535
FOR AN IMPORTANT
NEWS BULLETIN.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.402
ANOTHER
DIMENSIONAL OPENING

06:26.403 --> 06:28.669
HAS JUST APPEARED
ABOVE THE CITY.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.737
HERE'S YOUR ANSWER,
LEONARDO.

06:30.738 --> 06:31.903
TIME TO GO,
CUTIE.

06:31.904 --> 06:33.305
WE'LL HAVE
TO HURRY.

06:33.306 --> 06:35.305
APRIL'S RIGHT,
LITTLE FELLA.

06:35.306 --> 06:37.239
THOSE PORTALS
DON'T LAST LONG.

06:40.174 --> 06:42.308
WHAT GOT INTO HIM?

06:42.309 --> 06:45.043
YO, DUDES,
DON'T LOOK NOW,

06:45.044 --> 06:47.910
BUT SOMETHING ELSE JUST
ZAPPED THROUGH THE GAP.

06:47.911 --> 06:49.911
LEONARDO, I SUGGEST
YOU AND THE TURTLES

06:49.912 --> 06:52.011
INVESTIGATE THIS
LATEST OCCURRENCE.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.847
APRIL AND I WILL DEAL
WITH OUR LITTLE FRIEND.

06:54.848 --> 06:58.382
<i>RIGHT, SENSEI.
LET'S GO, FELLAS.</i>

06:58.383 --> 07:00.382
MICHELANGELO,
ARE YOU SURE

07:00.383 --> 07:02.617
YOU SAW SOMETHING
COME THROUGH THE PORTAL?

07:02.618 --> 07:06.585
OH, FOR SURE, DUDE. IT WAS
TOTALLY WEIRD-LOOKING.

07:06.586 --> 07:08.052
CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT?

07:08.053 --> 07:11.287
WELL, YEAH, IT WAS
KIND OF LIKE, UH...

07:11.288 --> 07:12.887
LIKE THAT THING.

07:12.888 --> 07:14.988
IT'S THE STARMOBILE!

07:14.989 --> 07:18.257
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
THE NEUTRINOS ARE BACK.

07:18.258 --> 07:20.456
IT'S KALA,
DASK AND ZACK.

07:20.457 --> 07:23.424
HEY, TURTLES,
LONG TIME, NO SEE.

07:23.425 --> 07:26.759
YOU LOOK GROOVY,
MICHELANGELO.

07:28.262 --> 07:32.495
YOU LOOK PRETTY GROOVY
YOURSELF, KALA.

07:32.496 --> 07:35.762
YEAH, RIGHT. SO WHAT
ARE YOU GUYS DOING IN
OUR NECK OF THE UNIVERSE?

07:35.763 --> 07:37.897
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
KALA'S PET GRYBYX.

07:37.898 --> 07:39.431
DID YOU HAPPEN
TO SEE IT?

07:40.833 --> 07:44.166
IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE ABOUT YEA BIG

07:44.167 --> 07:46.200
AND ABLE TO FLY,
WOULD IT?

07:46.201 --> 07:48.501
AND WITH FUR
ALL OVER ITS BODY?

07:48.502 --> 07:51.436
THAT'S HIM!
CAN YOU TAKE US
TO HIM?

07:51.437 --> 07:54.771
WE SURE CAN, KALA.
JUST FOLLOW US.

07:54.772 --> 07:56.672
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY MELLOW?</i>

07:56.673 --> 07:59.439
THAT YOU CATS FOUND HIM
BEFORE HE ATE ANYTHING.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.073
YEAH, IF HE SCARFS
ANY EARTH GRUB,

08:02.074 --> 08:04.775
IT COULD BE
TRULY BAD NEWS.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.941
REALLY? HOW BAD?

08:06.942 --> 08:10.110
LIKE, I'M TALKING
REAL BAD.

08:13.212 --> 08:15.646
OH, THE POOR THING.

08:15.647 --> 08:17.346
IT SEEMS TO BE HUNGRY.

08:17.347 --> 08:21.047
GREAT. THERE'S ONE OF
MICHELANGELO'S PIZZAS,

08:21.048 --> 08:22.682
AND IT'S STILL WARM.

08:22.683 --> 08:25.249
APRIL, ARE YOU SURE
THIS THIS WISE?

08:25.250 --> 08:28.017
SUCH EXOTIC FOOD
MIGHT DISAGREE WITH HIM.

08:28.018 --> 08:31.519
NOW, WHAT HARM COULD
A LITTLE PIZZA DO?

08:31.520 --> 08:34.285
HE LIKES IT.

08:34.287 --> 08:36.154
THE TURTLECOM.
APRIL HERE.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.621
<i>GOOD NEWS, APRIL.</i>

08:37.621 --> 08:39.956
<i>OUR LITTLE VISITOR
BELONGS TO THE NEUTRINOS.</i>

08:39.957 --> 08:42.490
<i>THEY'RE RETURNING
TO THE LAIR WITH US
TO PICK HIM UP.</i>

08:42.491 --> 08:44.256
OH, JUST ONE THING,

08:44.258 --> 08:46.691
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T FEED HIM.

08:51.328 --> 08:54.361
OH, NOW HE TELLS US.

09:04.299 --> 09:06.467
YOU WERE RIGHT, SPLINTER!

09:06.468 --> 09:09.233
THE PIZZA DID
DISAGREE WITH IT.

09:09.234 --> 09:11.968
I FEEL THE NEXT THING
IT EATS MAY BE US.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.603
APRIL, ARE YOU
AND SPLINTER ALL RIGHT?

09:14.604 --> 09:16.837
WELL,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

09:16.838 --> 09:18.704
WE'VE GOT
A SMALL PROBLEM...

09:22.507 --> 09:26.374
WHICH JUST TURNED
INTO A BIG PROBLEM.

09:26.375 --> 09:29.542
UH-OH, SHE MUST
HAVE FED THE GRYBYX
SOMETHING.

09:29.543 --> 09:31.776
APRIL, LISTEN CLOSELY!

09:31.777 --> 09:33.810
YOU GOT TO POUR
WATER ON IT!

09:33.811 --> 09:35.110
DO YOU HEAR ME, APRIL?

09:37.046 --> 09:40.146
THAT MIGHT BE
A PROBLEM FROM
UP HERE, KALA.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.247
HMM, PERHAPS NOT.

09:49.684 --> 09:51.251
IT WORKED. THE WATER
TURNED IT BACK

09:51.252 --> 09:53.384
INTO A CUTE
LITTLE CREATURE.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.119
I WOULD STILL
BE CAUTIOUS.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.053
APPEARANCES CAN
BE DECEPTIVE.

09:58.788 --> 10:01.488
POING! BYE-BYE.

10:02.489 --> 10:04.155
WAIT. DON'T GO!

10:04.156 --> 10:05.723
COME BACK HERE!

10:05.724 --> 10:08.058
NO USE. HE IS GONE.

10:08.059 --> 10:10.725
I'VE GOT
SOME BAD NEWS, FELLAS.

10:10.726 --> 10:13.325
THE GRYBYX FLEW THE COOP.

10:13.326 --> 10:14.860
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

10:14.861 --> 10:16.461
WHAT ELSE
CAN GO WRONG?

10:23.831 --> 10:26.065
CONGRATULATIONS, BEBOP.

10:26.066 --> 10:29.400
YOU SURFACED US IN
THE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE.

10:29.401 --> 10:31.367
UH, GEE, THANKS, BOSS.

10:31.368 --> 10:34.134
AND I WASN'T
EVEN TRYING.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.702
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHAT THE WATER
LOOKS LIKE

10:38.703 --> 10:40.803
AFTER I TAKE A BATH.

10:40.804 --> 10:44.505
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
THAT HAPPENED?

10:44.506 --> 10:46.139
UM, LET ME SEE,

10:46.140 --> 10:48.007
WHAT YEAR
IS THIS AGAIN?

10:48.008 --> 10:51.674
I THINK
IT'S THE YEAR
MY BATH IS DUE.

10:51.675 --> 10:54.276
ACCORDING TO THIS
ELECTROKINETIC DETECTOR,

10:54.277 --> 10:56.343
THE GRYBYX IS NEARBY.

10:56.344 --> 10:58.711
ALL OF YOU,
FOLLOW ME.

11:00.546 --> 11:03.146
I FEEL AWFUL, KALA.

11:03.147 --> 11:04.813
HE JUST TOOK OFF.

11:04.814 --> 11:06.813
IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT, APRIL,

11:06.814 --> 11:08.881
BUT WE GOT TO FIND HIM.

11:08.882 --> 11:10.982
AND QUICK
LIKE A BUNNY.

11:10.983 --> 11:11.949
EACH TIME HE EATS,

11:11.950 --> 11:14.017
HE GROWS BIGGER
AND MORE DANGEROUS.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.851
NOT TO WORRY,
GUYS AND GALS.

11:15.852 --> 11:18.985
THIS TRACKING
DEVICE WILL LEAD
US RIGHT TO HIM.

11:18.986 --> 11:21.387
TERRIFIC.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

11:25.155 --> 11:26.155
IT'S THE GRYBYX.

11:26.156 --> 11:27.789
QUICKLY, YOU FOOLS,
AFTER HIM!

11:33.059 --> 11:35.859
AM I HOLDING
ON TO YOU TOO TIGHTLY,
MICHELANGELO?

11:35.860 --> 11:38.493
NO, NOT TIGHT ENOUGH.

11:38.494 --> 11:39.827
HEY, I SEE HIM.

11:39.828 --> 11:41.094
SO DO I.

11:41.095 --> 11:43.161
AND I ALSO SEE
TROUBLE COMING.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.663
IT'S SHREDDER
AND HIS GOONS!

11:45.664 --> 11:48.163
NOW, ROCKSTEADY,
USE THE STUN LASER.

11:48.164 --> 11:49.598
OOH, RIGHT,
BOSS.

11:53.567 --> 11:56.500
JEEPERS, AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

11:56.501 --> 12:00.002
OOH. ME, TOO.

12:00.003 --> 12:03.369
WHAT A HEART-RENDING,
TOUCHING SCENE.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.671
STUN THEM.

12:06.373 --> 12:08.272
LASER BLASTS, INCOMING!

12:08.273 --> 12:10.339
NOW THEY'RE OUTGOING.

12:10.340 --> 12:12.440
NOW YOU KNOW WHY
HE'S OUR LEADER.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.840
TURTLES, FIGHT WITH HONOR!

12:14.841 --> 12:18.275
FINISH THEM QUICKLY!
I WANT THAT GRYBYX!

12:18.276 --> 12:20.577
YOU GOT HIM,
BOSS.

12:20.578 --> 12:23.644
<i>ALL RIGHT, AMIGOS,
LET'S KICK SOME SHELL!</i>

12:27.414 --> 12:31.148
EAT OUR LASER BEAMS, WIMP.

12:32.149 --> 12:35.450
HUH? IT'S ALL GUNKED UP.

12:39.785 --> 12:40.784
I GOT IT!

12:40.785 --> 12:42.885
IT'S MINE.

12:44.587 --> 12:45.587
COME ON!

12:45.588 --> 12:46.953
NO FAIR.

12:51.957 --> 12:53.056
COME ON, FELLA.

12:53.057 --> 12:54.691
LET'S YOU
AND ME RUMBLE.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.725
YOU WILL REMEMBER
TO WRITE, WON'T YA?

12:58.726 --> 13:01.060
YOU TURTLES HAVE
BUGGED ME LONG ENOUGH.

13:01.061 --> 13:03.560
NOW YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE EXTERMINATED.

13:06.297 --> 13:07.462
LOOK OUT!

13:10.398 --> 13:13.131
FAREWELL,
YOU MEDDLING REPTILE.

13:13.132 --> 13:14.731
WHAT?

13:17.568 --> 13:21.134
WHEN I GET MY HANDS
ON THAT BLASTED GRYBYX...

13:21.135 --> 13:24.469
SOMETHING TELLS ME
WE BETTER SPLIT.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.473
WOW, AND I THOUGHT
THE GRYBYX WAS ONLY DANGEROUS

13:33.474 --> 13:35.039
IF YOU FEED HIM!

13:35.040 --> 13:37.308
HE'S JUST
GOOFING AROUND.

13:37.309 --> 13:39.408
HE THINKS THIS
WHOLE THING IS A GAME.

13:39.409 --> 13:42.075
WE'VE GOT TO
CATCH HIM BEFORE
HE GETS HURT.

13:42.076 --> 13:43.709
OR WE DO.

13:45.077 --> 13:47.878
THAT'S BAD.

13:47.879 --> 13:49.546
YEAH.
IT'S REALLY GOING

13:49.547 --> 13:52.347
TO LOWER
THE TRADE-IN VALUE.

13:52.348 --> 13:55.581
BOSS, I THINK
WE OUGHT TO RUN.

13:55.582 --> 13:57.582
THE WORLD'S GREATEST
NINJA

13:57.583 --> 14:00.483
DOES NOT RUN FROM
SOMEONE'S FLUFFY LITTLE PET.

14:09.322 --> 14:11.021
THEY HIT THE GRYBYX!

14:11.022 --> 14:15.389
OH, NO.
MY POOR LITTLE PET.

14:15.390 --> 14:17.457
YOU GOT HIM,
BOSS.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.425
SO MUCH FOR THIS
FURRY TROUBLEMAKER.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.191
WELL, HOW WE
GONNA GET BACK

14:22.192 --> 14:24.692
TO THE TECHNODROME,
BOSS?

14:24.693 --> 14:26.627
THE MODULE'S BUSTED.

14:26.628 --> 14:27.761
GO, GREEN MACHINE!

14:27.762 --> 14:29.595
WE'LL WORRY
ABOUT THAT LATER.

14:29.596 --> 14:32.062
RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT
TURTLE TROUBLES.

14:36.665 --> 14:38.465
NOW LET'S GO. QUICKLY.

14:46.136 --> 14:49.102
WELL, DID YOU
GET THE GRYBYX?

14:49.103 --> 14:50.537
YES, BUT I'M AFRAID

14:50.538 --> 14:52.604
THE TRANSPORT MODULE
WAS DAMAGED.

14:52.605 --> 14:54.004
WE'LL NEED
ANOTHER ONE SENT UP.

14:54.005 --> 14:56.472
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT LATER.

14:56.473 --> 14:59.207
FIRST, YOU'LL DRAIN
THE GRYBYX'S ENERGY

14:59.208 --> 15:01.708
AND TRANSMIT IT
DOWN HERE.

15:01.709 --> 15:05.142
HOW COME YOU ALWAYS
COME UP WITH ALL THE IDEAS?

15:05.143 --> 15:08.610
BECAUSE I'M THE BRAIN
OF THIS OUTFIT.

15:09.744 --> 15:11.378
WELL, KALA, ANY LUCK?

15:11.379 --> 15:15.046
JEEPERS, NO.
THE GRYBYX READINGS
ARE VERY WEAK.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.047
HE MUST
BE UNCONSCIOUS.

15:17.048 --> 15:18.414
TOUGH BREAK,
CHICK.

15:18.415 --> 15:19.547
WE BETTER FIND HIM

15:19.548 --> 15:21.016
BEFORE SHREDDER
CAN CARRY OUT

15:21.017 --> 15:25.083
HIS EVIL, UNSCRUPULOUS,
INSIDIOUS PLAN.

15:25.084 --> 15:26.717
YOU FORGOT NEFARIOUS.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.885
HEY. NOBODY'S
PERFECT.

15:29.886 --> 15:31.386
THERE. IT'S DONE.

15:31.387 --> 15:33.453
THE HOOK-UP
IS COMPLETED.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.888
HOW'S IT WORK, BOSS?

15:35.889 --> 15:39.922
IT WILL COMPLETELY
DRAIN THE GRYBYX'S
PSYCHOKINETIC POWERS

15:39.923 --> 15:42.424
AND TRANSMIT THEM
TO THE TECHNODROME.

15:42.425 --> 15:45.792
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THE LITTLE GUY?

15:45.793 --> 15:48.960
DOES IT REALLY MATTER,
YOU SENTIMENTAL SOP?

15:48.961 --> 15:52.294
NOW STAND BACK. I'M ABOUT
TO THROW THE SWITCH.

16:07.602 --> 16:09.500
THE POWER DRAIN'S WORKING.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.603
BLAST IT.
A SHORT CIRCUIT.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.771
I'LL HAVE TO REPLACE
THIS COMPONENT.

16:16.772 --> 16:18.538
KEEP AN EYE ON THE GRYBYX.

16:18.539 --> 16:22.106
THAT FORCE FIELD SHOULD
KEEP ITS PSYCHOKINETIC POWERS
UNDER CONTROL.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.307
DON'T WORRY, BOSS.

16:24.308 --> 16:26.941
HE AIN'T GOING
NOWHERES.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.542
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T.

16:29.543 --> 16:33.778
ACCORDING TO THIS,
MY GRYBYX IS UP
ON THE SURFACE.

16:33.779 --> 16:36.512
THEN, LIKE,
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

16:36.513 --> 16:39.347
ALL REET.
LET'S BEAT FEET.

16:43.882 --> 16:47.983
GEE, I FEEL SORRY
FOR THE LITTLE GUY.

16:47.984 --> 16:50.951
AH, DON'T BE
SUCH A WUSS.

16:50.952 --> 16:53.586
IT'S ONLY
A DUMB ANIMAL.

16:57.155 --> 17:00.555
OH, LOOK.
HE'S HUNGRY.

17:00.556 --> 17:03.022
AT LEAST LET'S GIVE
HIM A LAST MEAL.

17:09.526 --> 17:11.959
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE OUGHT TO
DONE THAT.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.727
AW, WHAT HARM
CAN IT DO?

17:18.695 --> 17:22.297
UH-OH. I THINK
I MADE A BOO-BOO.

17:23.397 --> 17:26.031
HEY, GROOVY.
HE'S IN THAT PLACE.

17:26.032 --> 17:28.966
CI-DAROONI.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

17:35.637 --> 17:39.703
HOLY GUACAMOLE.
IT'S HUMONGOUS!

17:39.704 --> 17:41.038
WHY, THE LITTLE DICKENS

17:41.039 --> 17:42.439
MUST HAVE BEEN
SNACKING AGAIN.

17:56.044 --> 17:57.977
KALA, HE'S YOUR PET.

17:57.978 --> 18:00.045
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.879
THERE SURE IS, APRIL.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.980
I CAN RUN!

18:09.483 --> 18:12.816
DON'T YOU JUST HATE IT
WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T
CONTROL THEIR PETS?

18:12.817 --> 18:14.584
WITH THIS NEW COMPONENT,

18:14.585 --> 18:18.153
I CAN COMPLETE
THE POWER DRAIN
ON THAT BLASTED GRYBYX.

18:19.820 --> 18:23.889
OH, NO. NOW LOOK
AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE!

18:23.890 --> 18:26.756
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
BUG-BRAINS DOING HERE?

18:26.757 --> 18:31.257
UH, WELL, YOU KNOW
THAT CUTE LITTLE
GRYBYX WE CAPTURED?

18:31.258 --> 18:32.991
YES?

18:32.992 --> 18:36.193
WELL, UH, HE
AIN'T SO CUTE...

18:36.194 --> 18:38.728
AND, UH,
HE AIN'T SO LITTLE...

18:38.729 --> 18:41.629
AND, UH, HE AIN'T
SO CAPTURED.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.598
I'LL DEAL
WITH YOU TWO LATER,

18:46.599 --> 18:48.899
IF THERE IS A LATER!

18:48.900 --> 18:50.733
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE WENT THIS WAY.

18:50.734 --> 18:52.899
REALLY? HOW CAN
YOU TELL?

18:52.900 --> 18:55.200
JEEPERS,
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD'S
GOING TO NEED

18:55.201 --> 18:57.368
EXTENSIVE URBAN RENEWAL.

18:57.369 --> 18:58.769
SCOPE IT OUT, DUDES.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.404
HE'S CHASING SHREDDER,
ROCKSTEADY, AND BEBOP.

19:02.405 --> 19:05.938
GEE, FOR ONCE,
A MONSTER WHO'S
ON OUR SIDE.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.820
I HATE GRYBYXES.

19:43.821 --> 19:46.555
WOW, KALA,
THIS PET OF YOURS

19:46.556 --> 19:49.322
IS LIKE A ONE-MAN
DEMOLITION SQUAD.

19:51.224 --> 19:53.424
AND I MEAN THAT

19:53.425 --> 19:55.892
IN THE NICEST
POSSIBLE WAY.

19:59.494 --> 20:02.328
GANG, I THINK
IT'S TIME TO
HEAD FOR COVER!

20:02.329 --> 20:05.128
ALL REET.
LET'S RETREAT.

20:10.065 --> 20:13.098
THIS IS
SERIOUSLY UNCOOL.

20:13.099 --> 20:16.867
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE HEADED
FOR THAT BIG AQUARIUM
IN THE SKY.

20:16.868 --> 20:20.034
AQUARIUM!
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

20:20.035 --> 20:22.536
KALA, DO WHAT YOU CAN
TO STALL HIM.

20:22.537 --> 20:26.203
STOP! DON'T YOU
RECOGNIZE ME?

20:26.204 --> 20:29.105
I'M KALA.
YOU BELONG TO ME.

20:40.611 --> 20:44.511
AM I GLAD
TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

20:48.180 --> 20:50.280
RIGHTEOUS ACTION,
DUDE.

20:52.049 --> 20:53.748
IF THAT MEANS
GROOVY MOVE,

20:53.749 --> 20:56.415
I'M IN SYNC
WITH THE WAY YOU THINK.

20:59.318 --> 21:02.918
LISTEN, DROP IN ANYTIME,
NEUTRINOS.

21:02.919 --> 21:05.720
YEAH, JUST MAKE SURE
YOUR PET'S FED FIRST.

21:05.721 --> 21:08.120
SO LONG, GUYS,
IT'S BEEN A HOO-OOT.

21:08.121 --> 21:10.555
YEAH. BOSS CITY.

21:10.556 --> 21:13.923
WILL YOU THINK
OF ME, MICHELANGELO?

21:13.924 --> 21:16.057
FOR SURE, DUDETTE.

21:16.058 --> 21:17.790
SEE YOU LATER.

21:17.791 --> 21:19.391
BYE.
BYE.

21:19.392 --> 21:20.925
SO LONG!

21:25.362 --> 21:27.094
GEE. I THINK
I'M REALLY

21:27.095 --> 21:29.062
GOING TO MISS
THAT LITTLE GUY.

21:29.063 --> 21:32.230
THAT LITTLE GUY
OR THAT LITTLE GAL?

21:34.965 --> 21:37.465
I SURE HOPE THIS ISN'T
THE START OF AN EPIDEMIC.
