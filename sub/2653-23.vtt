WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.712
- Good morning, almost husband.
- Good morning, almost-

00:05.773 --> 00:08.083
Oh! No!

00:08.141 --> 00:10.383
Oh, calm down.
This can't be the first time you've woken up...

00:10.444 --> 00:11.946
with other men in your bedroom.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.960
- Happy wedding day.
- What are you doing here?

00:15.016 --> 00:19.431
You pay for a full-service wedding,
you get our full packages.

00:19.487 --> 00:22.400
Oh. Close, honey. So close.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.766
- And we're crossing.
- We're crossing.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.327
And trays down.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.340
Napkins.

00:28.896 --> 00:31.342
Relax. Enjoy.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.140
The car will pick you up at 4:00...

00:33.200 --> 00:35.976
to whisk you away
to your beautiful hilltop wedding.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.142
How's the weather?
I had a dream it rained on everyone.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.913
Dry as a bone. The only thing
it will be raining tonight is men.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.478
- We really need it.
- Has anyone heard from Sal?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.820
No. And I will never understand...

00:45.880 --> 00:49.293
why you asked that boozy us-hag
to officiate your wedding.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.523
We didn't exactly ask Sal.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.531
- Sal.
- Mm-hmm.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.464
We have something very important
to talk to you about.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.662
Yeah, we hope that maybe
you would be open to the idea-

00:57.725 --> 01:00.331
Yes! I will totally officiate your wedding.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.136
Oh, my drinks!

01:05.032 --> 01:07.034
It was supposed to be an intervention.

01:08.636 --> 01:10.513
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:10.571 --> 01:12.608
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:12.673 --> 01:14.710
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:14.775 --> 01:16.618
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:16.677 --> 01:17.849
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:20.214 --> 01:23.320
Hey, best man.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.886
Hello, blushing bride.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.522
I feel like I should hate that more.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.533
Yeah, I think I might go with
"best person."

01:28.589 --> 01:30.159
Anyway, I'm just calling
to see how you're doing.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.363
- I'm great.
- Really?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.566
Is this about Mom again?
I told you, I'm fine.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.472
My mother can't come to the wedding.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.033
She was at a yoga retreat...

01:39.100 --> 01:41.307
and she fell out of a warrior pose
and broke her hip.

01:41.368 --> 01:43.211
Should we consider the possibility...

01:43.270 --> 01:44.840
that someone pushed her?

01:44.905 --> 01:45.940
Cam, please.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.508
They were
a bunch of peace-loving hippies...

01:47.575 --> 01:49.452
who spent two weeks in the rain forest
with my mother.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.751
Of course someone pushed her.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.951
I'm actually relieved she's not coming.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.153
She has given me
the gift of a crazy-free wedding.

01:56.217 --> 01:58.128
I know. I was just a little sad for you.

01:58.185 --> 02:02.099
- Mom's a no-show, and you and Dad are hardly even speaking.
- Enough about Dad

02:02.156 --> 02:06.434
He doesn't get gay weddings,
and I don't get track suits as casual wear.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.598
Can we please talk about
something happy...

02:08.662 --> 02:10.437
like my honeymoon in Mexico?

02:10.497 --> 02:13.274
Oh, yeah. You're gonna want
to take a look at the Weather Channel.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.335
Hilarious.

02:14.401 --> 02:15.778
- Love you
- Love you too.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.440
You're gonna get the gift today, right?

02:17.505 --> 02:20.714
- Don't we have a year to do that?
- I have a husband to do that.

02:20.774 --> 02:25.018
They fell in love with this very specific
turquoise Italian glass bowl.

02:25.079 --> 02:28.458
I looked everywhere, finally found one,
and we're not going to that wedding without it.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.189
I thought you were taking me
to the eye doctor.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.958
They said I'm not supposed
to drive myself home.

02:32.019 --> 02:34.727
No, no, no, no. I'm picking up Luke
from his wilderness trip.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.631
- Alex can take you.
- That's a bummer.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.069
- Aw, Dad, I'm touched.
- No, not because of you. I'd just rather pick up Luke.

02:40.961 --> 02:43.066
Than go to the eye doctor.

02:43.130 --> 02:46.270
I love spending time with you.
Don't worry. You're fun.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.869
Wow.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.437
My dad would never admit this...

02:49.503 --> 02:51.540
but when he wants fun,
he goes straight to Luke.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.107
They have a weird connection.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.983
They're like Batman and Robin.

02:55.042 --> 02:58.546
Dad and I are more like
Batman and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.525
Honey, don't be like that.
You're super fun.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.084
You sure I can't get Luke?

03:03.150 --> 03:05.152
- I heard that!
- Let's do this!

03:05.219 --> 03:07.722
Hello?

03:07.788 --> 03:09.358
Hey, Mom. Gloria wants to know...

03:09.423 --> 03:11.994
if she can do your hair and makeup last
after me and Cam's mom.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.495
it's fine.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.064
Something about Luke. I've lost interest.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.632
Okay, love you. Bye.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.837
Damn, this is
the best cup of coffee I ever had.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.744
Manny roasts his own beans
every Friday night.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.079
That kid's gonna be
roasting his own beans for a long time...

03:25.139 --> 03:27.016
if you know what I mean.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.453
Can I just say thank you again
for letting us stay here?

03:30.511 --> 03:33.685
- You have thanked us enough with
that big bag of deer meat. - Aw.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.853
Hey, Mom. Can you see this?

03:36.917 --> 03:38.919
- What pimple?
- I knew it.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.488
I can't go looking like this.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.056
Weddings are where you meet girls.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.829
Not at this one.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.768
- Well, we better be going.
- Yeah.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.170
- Have a great spa day.
- Men don't have spa days.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.072
We're just going to the club...

03:50.130 --> 03:52.474
taking a steam,
having a couple of rubdowns.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.844
Hey. Do they serve cucumber water
at that place?

03:55.903 --> 03:58.645
- Sometimes they do a strawberry-basil mix.
- Ah.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.276
- Merle?
- Yes, ma'am?

04:00.341 --> 04:02.719
Be back in time for me to do your tie.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.414
Yes, ma'am.

04:07.114 --> 04:10.288
- I'm so sorry you had to see that.
- See what?

04:10.351 --> 04:13.457
- The way we just snapped at each other.
- Are you joking?

04:13.520 --> 04:17.559
Obviously, Merle and I are going through
a heck of a rough patch.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.627
If I talked to Jay that nice...

04:19.692 --> 04:21.695
he would think I'm cheating on him.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.639
Mrs. P?

04:23.697 --> 04:26.303
My darn taxi never came.
I'm gonna miss my flight.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.210
- No.
- I just-

04:28.269 --> 04:30.112
I don't want to deal with this right now-

04:30.170 --> 04:32.150
'cause I'm already so scared of flying.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.982
I just hate everything about it-
except for the food.

04:35.042 --> 04:38.216
I don't understand how they get
such bold flavors out of that tiny kitchen.

04:38.279 --> 04:41.590
Haley, can you drive Andy
to the airport, please?

04:41.649 --> 04:44.562
- She doesn't want to do that.
- Aw, you get me.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.565
- Haley.
- I don't have a car. I got dropped off.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.328
I guess we could take my car.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.063
That's settled. Go.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.230
- Fine.
- Okay.

04:54.395 --> 04:56.807
- We really need to hurry.
- Relax. We'll get there.

04:56.864 --> 05:00.607
You just worry about being strapped
in a giant metal tube 30,000 feet in the air.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.670
That's right. I heard.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.518
- Hey.
- What?

05:07.574 --> 05:10.145
I just thought of something.
What's going on with my hair today?

05:10.210 --> 05:13.054
Daddy's gonna do it up
really pretty with flowers.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.184
- Not you, right?
- No, other Daddy.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.853
Oh, thank God.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.420
Mitchell! This is not my tuxedo.
They gave me the wrong order.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.227
And the fuchsia gown didn't tip you off?

05:21.288 --> 05:23.359
I have nine shirts this color.
I'm wearing a shirt this color.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.926
Okay, deep breaths. Deep breaths.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.869
We have plenty of time
to go to the dry cleaner.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.100
We knew that there would be a bump today,
and here it is.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.302
We're getting it done early.
This is our bump.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.902
Oh! Oh!

05:33.967 --> 05:36.413
Okay. Okay. So this is our bump.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.718
I can't handle this.
We're getting married in five hours.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.816
I don't have my perfectly tailored tux.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.623
I can't just go buy something off the rack.
I'm not Cindy Crawford.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.459
Why a woman? I'm just wondering.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.658
- What are we gonna do?
- We could eat.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.429
We just need to get in touch
with the owner.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.992
You know his name, right?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.629
- It's... Aziz something?
- Uh, no, it's Amir.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.731
- It's not Amir, no.
- Oh, no, it's, uh, Ahmad.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.469
- It's Achmed.
- No. Oh, it's on the ticket.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.238
Now I'm just feeling racist.
What is it?

06:06.300 --> 06:08.678
- Here it is. Jerry.
- Oh, Jerry.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.613
- Amari.
- Jerry Amari.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.173
There you go.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.508
Can you see better in here?

06:14.575 --> 06:16.919
A little, but those drops
are really hanging on.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.514
I'm like Han Solo
right when he came out of the carbonite.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.082
Really? Nothing?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.059
- I get it. Star Trek.
- You're breaking my heart.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.721
Save it for Luke. He'll love that.

06:24.785 --> 06:27.493
- Can we just get the gift and get out of here?
- Right, but first things first.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.831
Let's put on some funny hats, act like they're
not there and walk around all serious.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.394
- What's the point of this?
- That's good. You're nailing it.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.771
Hi, honey.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.810
- How was the eye exam?
- Great.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.312
I can barely see. I'm wearing
giant sunglasses and a girlie hat.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.870
Alex and I are having a blast.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.472
But you got the gift, right?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.779
- That's what people tell me.
- Honey, the bowl.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.049
I have the bowl.
It's beautiful. I'll see you at home.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.454
Hey, here's a thought.
Now that you told Mom you got the bowl...

06:52.513 --> 06:54.151
how about we actually go get it?

06:54.214 --> 06:56.524
Yes, no more fooling around.
Let's go get the bowl.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.358
Oh! Right after we find out
our sleep number.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.523
Ow!

07:00.754 --> 07:04.361
- There's my guy.
- I thought Dad was picking me up.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.735
Oh. I missed you too. Come here.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.398
Aw.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.573
- So, did you have fun?
- Yeah.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.873
- What was your favorite thing?
- I don't remember.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.404
- It was yesterday.
- Hot dogs. Can we go now?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.144
Honey, I feel bad
that you have to leave early.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.652
- What are you missing today?
- Boating.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.881
Well, I mean, we have a little time.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.651
You don't mind waiting in the car?

07:28.182 --> 07:33.291
So Cam tells me you and Mitch
had a little dust up.

07:33.353 --> 07:34.696
Yeah.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.429
Couple of weeks ago.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.596
That kid can hold a grudge.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.368
Little uncomfortable about that wedding,
are you?

07:42.429 --> 07:44.102
Well, you know what I'm feeling, right?

07:44.164 --> 07:48.112
I like to think
I've evolved on the subject.

07:48.168 --> 07:51.809
We got a couple of lesbo swans
in the pond.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.442
They seem pretty happy.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.143
- Hey, Jay.
- Hey.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.780
Howard, Larry.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.418
This is my, uh-

08:01.482 --> 08:04.224
This is my friend Merle,
and he's visiting from Missouri.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.628
Ooh, the "Show Me" state.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.463
Don't say that in here.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.070
So, what brings you to town, Merle?

08:14.127 --> 08:18.803
Well, uh, our-

08:18.866 --> 08:23.611
Jay's and my... kids
are getting married today.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.672
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that nice?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.309
Father of the bride,
father of the groom...

08:27.374 --> 08:29.581
taking a steam together
the day of the wedding.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.247
Yeah, something like that.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.416
The day my son got married- piece of cake.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.791
But the day I lost my little girl-
Oh, that wrecked me.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.296
So which one of you
has to suffer through that today?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.260
You know what? it's too hot in here.

08:42.322 --> 08:43.392
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.528
Mm-hmm. Real evolved.

08:45.592 --> 08:47.333
Your swans would be ashamed.

08:48.829 --> 08:52.436
Well, I guess I first noticed it
after Pameron moved out...

08:52.499 --> 08:55.571
and Merle and I
just started sniping at each other.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.912
Yeah, like that bloodbath this morning.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.212
Oh. Again, I am so sorry.

09:00.274 --> 09:04.279
But Merle is not the type
you can talk to about things.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.553
I mean, the man's had a toothpick
in his mouth our whole marriage...

09:07.614 --> 09:10.117
and I can't say a word?

09:10.183 --> 09:13.096
No, you can't sit on your feelings.
You will explode.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.464
I have, like,
10 little explosions every day...

09:16.523 --> 09:18.799
so I don't have the big one.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.102
The women in my family,
sometimes they shoot the husbands.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.632
Well, we've had 48... good years.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.976
I guess we're just
gonna run out the clock.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.449
No! You're still-

09:32.506 --> 09:34.611
You have-

09:34.675 --> 09:36.177
That is bad attitude.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.053
You have to tell Merle
what is bothering you.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.217
Oh, he doesn't want to hear all that.

09:41.281 --> 09:44.694
He gets all closed off and-
macho.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.563
You're ticklin' my piggies.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.932
You get used to that.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.063
It's a shame Mitchell's mother
couldn't make it to the wedding.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.572
For who?

09:55.629 --> 09:58.542
Hmm, things still rough
between the two of you?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.977
Merle, things have always been rough.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.947
That woman never stopped complaining.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.008
Finding the strength to leave Dede
was the hardest thing I ever did...

10:07.074 --> 10:09.520
but the best decision I ever made.

10:09.576 --> 10:13.080
Well, you sure made a score
with that Gloria. Wow.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.285
Big time.

10:15.349 --> 10:18.728
I bet you landed her before she got
a gander at those hooves of yours.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.527
You're welcome, by the way.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.833
So what are you gonna do in Utah?

10:25.892 --> 10:29.237
Well, me and my girlfriend
haven't seen each other in a while...

10:29.296 --> 10:33.073
- so we're gonna be like a couple of bunny rabbits-
- Wow.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.773
- Just hopping all over town.
- Oh.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.544
- Is this her?
- Yep, that's my Beth.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.586
Huh. She's pretty.

10:41.642 --> 10:45.488
Yeah. She's the most
beautiful creature, inside and out.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.786
I'm just the luckiest guy ever
to get to love her.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.625
Okay, she may be real,
but no way you are. Who talks like that?

10:51.685 --> 10:53.528
You know, I hate
when you say things like that...

10:53.587 --> 10:55.794
because you are funny
and you are pretty...

10:55.856 --> 10:57.767
and you are smart in an original way...

10:57.824 --> 10:59.701
so why shouldn't a guy
feel lucky to love you?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.535
Shut up. Be normal.

11:01.595 --> 11:03.097
Hey, my phone just buzzed.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.665
- Can you read it?
- Yeah.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.711
I don't want to put our lives at risk.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.147
It's, uh- it's from the airline.

11:10.203 --> 11:12.046
Your flight's delayed three hours.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.085
- Three hours?
- Yeah.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.643
Jinkies!

11:15.709 --> 11:18.451
I guess we can just drop me off
at a coffee shop...

11:18.512 --> 11:20.924
- and I can take a cab from there.
- Okay.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.558
Actually, I really need to wake up.

11:24.618 --> 11:26.655
Maybe I'll grab a coffee with you,
if you don't mind.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.633
Please. The more I talk to people,
the less I imagine...

11:29.690 --> 11:33.160
plummeting to my death in a fiery spiral
of screaming and crying.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.503
Pretty dark for someone
who just said "jinkies."

11:36.563 --> 11:39.510
Well, I guess we have
different definitions of "emergency" then.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.102
You know, I'm just gonna say it.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.205
911 dispatchers
have a little bit of attitude.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.045
Well, you requested a SWAT team.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.415
Is anybody else hungry?

11:47.474 --> 11:50.478
Mitchell. Mitchell! Look at this.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.922
- Do you think you could fit in there?
- I'm not doing that.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.516
Then what am I gonna wear to our wedding,
my black funeral suit?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.084
Is that the tone you want to set?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.687
You wore it to one funeral,
and you didn't even know Bea Arthur.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.494
- I felt like I did.
- I know.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.057
Oh.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.796
It's Pepper. He'll know what to do.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.633
- Yes.
- Pepper. Disaster.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.400
It's not a disaster.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.100
It's just a wildfire.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.769
And it's most certainly
not going to burn down your wedding.

12:12.833 --> 12:13.834
- What?
- What?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.538
There's a wildfire near the venue.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.707
- No!
- Yes, but it's fine.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.978
Ronaldo is going to text-blast
the guest list...

12:20.040 --> 12:23.112
tell them the wedding
is being moved from 5:00 to 1 :00.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.348
Oh, my God!

12:24.411 --> 12:26.049
Don't panic.

12:26.113 --> 12:30.220
Would somebody
please turn off that wretched waterfall?

12:30.283 --> 12:32.490
Kill the waterfall immediately!

12:33.687 --> 12:36.725
The fire is already 28% contained.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.566
- That doesn't sound like a lot.
- Just get dressed and look pretty.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.970
I'm going to send the car for you
in one hour.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.240
Have you lost your mind?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.376
Go! You disgust me!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.973
Go!

12:52.038 --> 12:54.348
Okay. Now what are we gonna do?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.650
No, I guess maybe- Cam, there's no way
I could fit through there.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.284
You two exhaust me.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.962
What? We have to be there in an hour!

13:08.021 --> 13:10.865
I can't go like this. Look at me.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.426
I hate you.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.632
Prepare yourself
for the best burger of your life.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.868
We gotta go.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.213
Uh-oh.

13:24.271 --> 13:27.718
- Maybe we should try on more hats.
- You think we have time?

13:27.774 --> 13:29.583
It's not working.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.145
And there's no oar?

13:31.211 --> 13:33.851
We are literally up a creek
without a paddle.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.723
Okay, Lily? Lily!

13:35.782 --> 13:38.524
Okay, you're gonna
press the green button to start it...

13:38.585 --> 13:41.828
and then you're gonna look for number 913.

13:41.888 --> 13:44.960
And then, when you see it go by,
you press the red button to stop it, okay?

13:45.025 --> 13:48.097
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.438
I get us into these situations and I freak,
and then you always fix the problem.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.102
We each have our own gifts.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.874
It's just it's easier for me
to stay calm in the face of-

13:55.936 --> 13:58.007
Oh, my God!

13:58.071 --> 14:02.110
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Lily, Daddy's coming for you!

14:05.679 --> 14:08.421
Okay now, Lily, press the red button.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.722
- I'm breaking the window!
- Put that down!

14:10.784 --> 14:12.923
- Oh.
- Oh.Thank God you're here.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.159
Are you breaking into my store?

14:16.122 --> 14:18.568
Uh, no. Why would you even say that?

14:18.625 --> 14:20.798
- My alarm went off.
- Oh, well, okay.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.205
That is a coincidence,
because his tuxedo is in there...

14:23.263 --> 14:25.937
and we're getting married in an hour.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.206
You are totally saving us.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.714
You know, I freak out
at situations like this...

14:30.770 --> 14:32.750
which forces him to fix the problem.

14:32.806 --> 14:36.185
- I do. I do.
- So I'm over here freaking out...

14:36.243 --> 14:39.281
while he's somewhere else,
fixing the problem.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.417
- Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.588
Oh! Oh.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.294
Maybe that's a good thing.
You know, the yin, the yang.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.460
Yeah, whatever, Jerry.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.797
Where'd she come from?

14:51.858 --> 14:53.633
Oh, because she doesn't look like us.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.195
- That's offensive.
- Oh, Jerry.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.764
Oh, Jerry.

14:59.366 --> 15:02.609
- What are we going to do?
- I know how to get up there.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.012
I'm blind. Follow me.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.208
- Oh, I'm not doing that.
- Alex!

15:10.110 --> 15:12.351
Excuse me. Could someone help me
to find the back of the line?

15:12.412 --> 15:13.948
- Oh, no, no. it's okay.
- Oh.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.516
- Go right ahead.
- Are you sure?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.619
- Can I help you?
- Yes, picking up for Dunphy.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.391
It's on hold, I believe.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.898
Beautiful day, huh? I was told.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.561
Here we go. Credit card?

15:24.624 --> 15:27.366
Uh, just to be sure,
that is turquoise, right?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.839
Because my wife said
it also comes in emerald.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.035
Yes. Sir, it's a very long line.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.806
Hmm. Okay.
Um, can I have it for one second?

15:36.770 --> 15:37.771
Thank you.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.752
Yeah, that doesn't feel like turquoise.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.379
You can feel color?
You gotta be kidding me.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.549
When you lose one sense,
all your other senses become heightened.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.524
That's why you sound
so loud and judgy to me.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.824
- My mistake, sir. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.690
Here it is.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.599
Hey, he's messing with the blind guy.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.399
Thank you- wherever you are.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.736
- I don't think he's really blind.
- Excuse me.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.776
My father suffered methanol poisoning...

16:04.831 --> 16:06.708
on a humanitarian mission in Honduras...

16:06.766 --> 16:10.612
resulting in permanent neurological
dysfunction and irreversible blindness.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.708
It's been hard enough on our family
without people like you making it worse.

16:13.773 --> 16:17.721
If he feels it's not the bowl,
it's not the bowl.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.254
I'm so sorry.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.554
I'll check on the turquoise.

16:22.615 --> 16:27.030
- Okay, that was kind of fun.
- I'm winking at you right now.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.994
Oh! This is not working.

16:30.056 --> 16:34.027
We are never gonna get there on time,
and I am the best person!

16:34.094 --> 16:36.074
Oh, God. Oh!

16:36.129 --> 16:37.802
I think just broke a nail on a turtle.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.810
You're the one
who wanted to come out here.

16:39.866 --> 16:43.643
Yes, I did, because I wanted to spend
some time with my son.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.240
You've-  You've been
pushing me away so much lately...

16:46.306 --> 16:48.684
and I don't want you
to grow up to be the kind of kid...

16:48.742 --> 16:51.814
- who doesn't care if his mom shows up at his wedding.
- What are you talking about?

16:51.878 --> 16:55.485
Nana isn't coming today,
and Mitchell's relieved.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.927
Well, I'd be really sad
if you missed my wedding.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.124
Really? You promise?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.064
Totally. And so would Kate.

17:03.123 --> 17:07.230
- Who's Kate?
- Upton. My wife, your daughter-in-law.

17:07.292 --> 17:08.795
- Oh.
- Get on board.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.866
Come on.
What has been going on with you recently?

17:11.931 --> 17:13.433
You've been so moody.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.140
I'm sorry, but I'm sick
of going to school...

17:16.202 --> 17:19.775
and hearing teachers say,
"You're Alex Dunphy's brother? Really?"

17:19.839 --> 17:22.580
- Like I'm an idiot.
- Oh, honey, you're not an idiot.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.249
I forgot the paddle even though we just
learned the boating checklist yesterday.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.053
Alex would never do that.

17:28.114 --> 17:31.357
And if she did, she'd probably,
like- I don't know-

17:31.418 --> 17:36.925
use this fishing rod to cast out and hook us
on the shore because "I'm so smart."

17:36.990 --> 17:41.097
And then she'd pull us in
because everything she does always works.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.937
Oh, my God.
It's working. it's working.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.705
Figures. Alex.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.980
Ooh, ooh. Don't move.
The lighting is really cool right now.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.380
What are you doing? Don't smile.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.817
Why? it's my favorite thing.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.717
No, really, be serious.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.722
- Look out the window.
- Okay.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.594
- Look.
- Whoa!

18:04.651 --> 18:07.063
That is honestly the best photo
anyone's ever taken of me.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.566
- Thank you.
- You mind if I send a copy to Beth?

18:10.623 --> 18:12.364
Andy, um...

18:13.359 --> 18:15.202
when I read the text about your flight...

18:15.261 --> 18:18.071
I saw the text from Beth
telling you not to come.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.305
Yeah, she doesn't mean that.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.074
She said it's over.

18:23.136 --> 18:25.207
That can mean a lot of different things.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.851
Your phone's buzzing again.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.554
Oh, my God. The wedding got moved up.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.251
I have to go.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.393
Andy, are you sure
about getting on that plane?

18:38.451 --> 18:39.953
Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm fine.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.896
You know, she does this
every once in a while.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.265
- She just likes the drama.
- But I-

18:44.324 --> 18:47.430
Haley, I appreciate your concern,
I really do...

18:47.494 --> 18:50.202
but I've been in this relationship
off and on for eight years...

18:50.263 --> 18:52.436
so I kind of know
what I'm doing, all right?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.001
Thank you for the ride.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.546
it's a tool of the trade.
The car one says Toyota.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.858
- I have eyes on the grooms.
- I'm three feet behind you.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.258
How's it going? Are people showing up?

19:10.316 --> 19:11.818
It's all under control.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.092
Surprise!
Guess who's on time.

19:14.154 --> 19:17.067
- Oh, my God! Sal, wow. You're pregnant.
- Congratulations.

19:17.123 --> 19:19.569
Thank you. We're really excited.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.071
You're huge.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.367
Nice teeth.

19:22.428 --> 19:25.034
- Uh, so, wh-where's Tony?
- Oh, beats me.

19:25.098 --> 19:26.941
- Haven't spoken to him since the divorce.
- Oh.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.344
Yeah, it's, uh, Eddie. Eddie! Baby.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.904
- Yeah.
- Come here. Come meet the girls.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.745
- Eddie.
- This is Eddie.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.547
Cam, Mitch, Peps, this guy.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.645
- Hey.
- This is Eddie, my baby daddy.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.884
- So why didn't you tell us?
- We just wanted to get through that first trimester...

19:40.947 --> 19:42.927
- before we let the cat out of the bag.
- Mm-hmm.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.290
When was that, last summer?

19:44.350 --> 19:47.729
- So you're how far along now?
- About four months.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.289
- Right, honey?
- Yep.

19:49.355 --> 19:53.462
Just about the exact amount of time
Eddie and I have been together.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.905
I don't understand.
Four is this many, yes?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.237
Sí.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.902
Hola, handsome boys.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.946
- You two look gorgeous.
- Gracias.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.947
- Thank you.
- Pretty nice, huh? Like a regular wedding.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.339
- What?
- Good start, Jay.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.944
Hey, Merle, it's your son's wedding.
Maybe lose the toothpick?

20:11.611 --> 20:14.251
I'm getting tired of this nagging.
I'm leaving you.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.658
- What?
- Not if I leave you first.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.629
- No, no, no. You don't mean this.
- Don't you feel bad, honey.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.256
You have helped me today.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.631
Thanks for getting me over the hump.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.164
What did you do?

20:26.226 --> 20:29.036
Wow. We're doing this.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.631
Are you ready?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.643
I don't want to wait another minute.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.009
Lily, hit it.

20:42.675 --> 20:46.122
On three, boys. One, two-

20:46.179 --> 20:48.386
Attention! Attention, please.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.156
The fire has jumped the freeway.
I'm really sorry, folks.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.356
I'm gonna have to evacuate
everyone immediately.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.968
So this is our bump.
