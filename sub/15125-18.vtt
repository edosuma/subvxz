WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:05.806
Hey, guys, we're here.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.874
Hey.
(yells)

00:06.907 --> 00:09.410
What is the matter
with you?

00:09.443 --> 00:10.678
(muffled):
Homemade teeth whitening.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.246
Put a drop of bleach
and some baking soda

00:12.280 --> 00:13.681
in our Halloween teeth.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.982
VIRGINIA:
And wham bam,

00:15.015 --> 00:16.150
our chiclets are whiter than

00:16.184 --> 00:17.585
the cast of "Downtown" Abbey.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.653
If we're gonna be on TV,
we got to look good.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.323
This telethon is gonna be seen
by literally dozens of people.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.592
Oh, right.
The telethon is this year.

00:24.625 --> 00:25.993
A telethon for what?

00:26.026 --> 00:27.361
I don't know
what's it's for.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.197
Schools or disease or...

00:29.230 --> 00:30.998
people who drowned
in that salami.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.600
The important thing is
they get their money

00:32.633 --> 00:35.503
and we finally get to
sing our song on TV!

00:35.536 --> 00:37.171
VIRGINIA:
For years, Burt and I tried

00:37.205 --> 00:38.572
to perform our special song

00:38.606 --> 00:40.341
on Natesville's
Quad-Annual Telethon.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.110
This is it, Virginia,
we're up next.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.411
Are you ready?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.712
(yells)

00:44.745 --> 00:47.715
No, I think it's
a higher register, like...

00:47.748 --> 00:49.417
(sings high note)

00:49.450 --> 00:52.553
No. I'm having our baby.
No...

00:52.586 --> 00:54.522
VIRGINIA: But no matter
how many times we tried,

00:54.555 --> 00:56.124
something always
seemed to go wrong.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.726
Also, we just want to thank
Ploppies Fish Dogs

00:58.759 --> 01:00.594
for feeding all of our
hardworking volunteers

01:00.628 --> 01:04.398
with their wonderful
fish-based sausage products.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.801
And now, it's time
for a little song...

01:07.835 --> 01:09.937
from Virginia and Burt Chance.

01:09.970 --> 01:12.373
Good evening, Natesville.

01:12.406 --> 01:16.076
What a treat it is to be here
for this wonderful cause.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.381
Now we'd like to
sing a song for you.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.650
Who likes rock and roll?

01:22.683 --> 01:24.752
A-one, a-two...
(Barney coughs)

01:24.785 --> 01:27.955
(choking):
Fish bone. Fish... fish bone.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.059
Okay, I know
we tried this before,

01:32.092 --> 01:35.129
but back again this year,
Virginia and Burt Chance...

01:35.163 --> 01:36.397
Great cause.
Right to the song.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.731
And a-one, and a-two...

01:37.765 --> 01:39.667
MAN (over TV):
Breaking news.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.435
This just in...

01:41.469 --> 01:44.438
This is the first telethon since
we became friends with Barney.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.408
So we are guaranteed
to get on the air.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.010
Why's it such a big deal to sing
your song on a local telethon?

01:50.043 --> 01:51.979
We know we're
amazing singers.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.915
But now, through the
magic of television...

01:54.948 --> 01:56.484
the whole world
will know.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.586
This will finally
legitimize us as people.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.721
I think you guys might be
putting too much weight on TV.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.258
It's just a bunch of people
saying clever quips

02:04.292 --> 02:06.827
followed by
a catchy theme song.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.663
* Whoo!

02:09.697 --> 02:14.535
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:16.504 --> 02:17.705
Uh-oh.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.540
Bad news.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.643
Either Gil has learned to do
the sidestroke, or he's dead.

02:22.676 --> 02:23.777
(gasps)

02:23.811 --> 02:25.213
Oh, no.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.882
Poor Hope--
she's gonna be so upset.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.351
(sighs)
We need your help.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.119
We're in the middle
of a crisis, Mom.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.521
Hope's goldfish died.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.323
That's not a crisis.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.391
A crisis is when they move your
favorite show to Friday night.

02:37.425 --> 02:38.526
Now I don't know
whether Booth and Bones

02:38.559 --> 02:40.060
are still boning on Bones.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.729
Or when your granddaughter
swallows a marble

02:41.762 --> 02:43.664
and you go to the hospital,
and then you realize

02:43.697 --> 02:46.133
you forgot to VCR
your favorite show.
Bones.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.236
Wait, did that
actually happen to Hope?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.203
Don't change the subject.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.571
So about this dead fish,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.340
here's what you do:
don't tell Hope

02:52.373 --> 02:54.642
and just replace it with one
that looks exactly the same.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.544
That's what they do on TV;
it works every time.

02:56.577 --> 02:58.212
Yeah, when they do that
though, it always leads to

02:58.246 --> 02:59.480
complications
no one expected.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.981
Yeah, but those
complications

03:01.014 --> 03:02.516
always lead to a funny
and heartwarming ending.

03:02.550 --> 03:03.817
Every time.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.186
Or we could take
this opportunity

03:06.220 --> 03:07.721
to teach our daughter
about death.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.723
You guys, not everybody
has to live their lives

03:09.757 --> 03:11.425
like they're characters
on a television show.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.327
What you just said,
that's so Raven.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.162
Wait, so what's
happening now?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.164
I invited my new boss over
for dinner tonight,

03:17.197 --> 03:20.167
so I need to pretend that
Burt and I live here...

03:20.200 --> 03:22.169
and you guys are
the maid and butler.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.371
Yeah, we're not doing that.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.006
We already have a full house.
I don't want to spend

03:26.039 --> 03:27.275
the whole night trying
to figure out who's the boss.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.443
Especially when we have
family matters to discuss.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.211
Fine, but we need to
borrow your dining room table.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.413
'Cause not all of us
were born

03:32.446 --> 03:34.248
with silver spoons
in our mouths.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.751
Good times.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.920
VIRGINIA: This dinner
is my opportunity

03:39.953 --> 03:41.389
to show Louise
I have what it takes

03:41.422 --> 03:42.923
to be Regional
Assistant Manager.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.592
Don't be nervous,
just be yourself.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.859
What are you, crazy?

03:45.893 --> 03:47.728
I can't be myself
and neither can you.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.929
We got to be whatever
they want us to be.
(doorbell rings)

03:48.962 --> 03:51.098
Whatever they say or do,
just go with it.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.269
LOUISE:
Oh! Oh! (laughs)

03:55.303 --> 03:57.204
Oh! Oh! Virginia!

03:57.237 --> 03:58.306
Louise!

03:58.339 --> 03:59.573
Oh!

03:59.607 --> 04:01.609
(both laughing)

04:01.642 --> 04:03.043
Oh, and who's this

04:03.076 --> 04:05.078
smoking hunk of beef?
(groans)

04:05.112 --> 04:07.281
Uh, my husband, Burt.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.449
And who's this

04:08.482 --> 04:10.951
slow... roasted...
pork shoulder?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.086
You're doing great.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.988
That's my husband, Talon.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.725
And I know it looks like
there's a big age difference,

04:17.758 --> 04:21.329
but that's just because
I can still pull young tail.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.632
(laughing loudly)

04:24.665 --> 04:27.134
(laughter)

04:29.269 --> 04:31.672
I hope everybody likes
Howdy's special blend

04:31.705 --> 04:33.474
of instant dark roast.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.008
I do, but none for Talon.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.677
Too bitter.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.413
Oh, hey, you got any of that
hot chocolate with the, uh,

04:39.447 --> 04:40.814
little marshmallows in it?

04:40.848 --> 04:43.351
Uh... I've got
chocolate syrup and water,

04:43.384 --> 04:45.953
and I can pick the marshmallow
charms out of the cereal.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.121
Works for Talon.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.290
You remember
what we talked about?

04:50.324 --> 04:52.560
No third person?

04:54.462 --> 04:56.497
Now, go help Burt.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.999
Ladies need
to talk business.

05:03.404 --> 05:05.673
So, what's
your allowance?

05:06.507 --> 05:07.541
Would you like some cream?

05:07.575 --> 05:09.209
No, I take it black.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.778
No, I know. Me, too.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.179
Of course. Yeah.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.150
Mmm.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.687
You know, Virginia...
Yeah.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.990
...I started out as a maid,
just like you.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.559
You remind me a lot of myself.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.796
Yeah, there's not a lot
of white blonde maids.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.131
Virginia, that's
a little racist.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.232
Uh-huh.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.401
I love it.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.068
(both laugh)

05:35.102 --> 05:36.737
And I like you!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.707
We should get to know
each other better.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.174
You like squash?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.810
Squash.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.845
I... Well, I love squash.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.079
Mm-hmm.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.214
Squash is a game?

05:47.247 --> 05:48.181
I guess so.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.383
That makes no sense.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.584
I know.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.852
If any vegetable
deserves its own game,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.220
it's the potato.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.488
It's the basis of
everything delicious.

05:54.522 --> 05:55.823
It's given us the baked,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.759
the mashed, the fried,
the totted.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.693
What is squash?

05:59.727 --> 06:00.994
Au gratin.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.763
Looks like
a rich man's handball,

06:02.796 --> 06:04.598
and they play with these
skinny little tennis racquets.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.333
Oh, no. Ugh.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.601
If I'm horrible,

06:07.635 --> 06:09.369
I'll make a fool of myself

06:09.403 --> 06:12.205
and ruin all the progress
I just made with my new boss.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.875
My career will be over
before it's even started.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.877
This is a complication
that was entirely unexpected.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.412
(sighs)
Lord.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.918
After hitting the
front wall first,

06:24.952 --> 06:27.888
the ball may hit any
other number of walls

06:27.921 --> 06:30.858
before landing in the
opponent's quarter court.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.726
I'm telling you, this game
would be a lot more fun

06:32.760 --> 06:34.428
if it was just people throwing
squashes at each other.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.296
How about fat people
sitting on each other?

06:36.329 --> 06:38.298
That's two games right there
that deserve to be called squash

06:38.331 --> 06:39.467
more than this one.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.435
Yeah, I think
I'm just gonna...

06:41.469 --> 06:43.303
Ow! Ow, my ankle!

06:43.336 --> 06:45.939
Are you okay?

06:45.973 --> 06:47.140
Great, you bought it.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.776
Now I can fake an injury.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.044
(chuckles)
No, I didn't buy it.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.946
I just thought we were
role playing, uh,

06:52.980 --> 06:54.414
injured lady and paramedic

06:54.448 --> 06:56.049
who likes to hook up
with injured lady.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.018
No, but keep
that one filed away.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.320
I found my old
squash racquet.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.822
Yeah.
Oh.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.957
I have got a lot
of really great squash stories.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.759
So, how's it going
with the fish?

07:05.793 --> 07:07.127
Being honest was a bust.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.129
Knew it. Told you
since you were a kid,

07:09.162 --> 07:11.131
truth is overrated.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.834
Yeah, about that fish--
tell us exactly what happened.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.835
We had a funeral.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.637
Please watch
over Gilly

07:16.670 --> 07:20.107
as he swims in that
great bowl in the sky,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.175
and...

07:22.209 --> 07:23.477
(toilet flushes)

07:23.511 --> 07:26.446
(laughs)

07:26.480 --> 07:28.248
Well, now that
she's flushed him,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.417
in order to replace him,
you're gonna have to tell her

07:30.450 --> 07:32.520
that it swam through the pipes
and up the sink.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.121
Kids are dumb.
They'll believe anything.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.355
No, it's not
that hard to believe.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.924
I remember
when I was a kid,

07:36.957 --> 07:40.093
my fish swam out of the sink
at least five...

07:40.127 --> 07:41.529
Aw, man.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.030
See?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.832
See, that is how
a little girl

07:44.865 --> 07:46.534
should react
when her pet dies.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.335
But Hope--
she just giggled.

07:48.368 --> 07:49.770
It was creepy.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.839
Well, she is the child
of a serial killer.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.307
I love her, but I got to admit,
when I'm alone with her,

07:54.341 --> 07:55.976
I always have an exit strategy.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.178
It was our fault. I mean, we
never made her take care of it,

07:58.211 --> 07:59.547
so she never
connected emotionally.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.782
Right. So we got her
Gilly the Second.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.884
And this time she's been feeding
it and taking care of it.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.519
I'm sure that's gonna
help her forge a bond.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.521
Yeah. So when it dies,
she'll cry.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.557
Instead of laughing
and flushing it down the toilet

08:09.590 --> 08:10.891
with her dead shark eyes.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.627
Dead fish. Dead fish.

08:13.661 --> 08:14.828
What?

08:14.862 --> 08:16.630
Ugh.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.566
We just bought that fish
yesterday.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.635
Flush the fish. Flush the fish.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.170
(laughs)

08:23.203 --> 08:24.572
I'm scared to say it,

08:24.605 --> 08:26.306
but I think she's taking
after her mother.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.875
I-I'm sure she just didn't
connect with it

08:27.908 --> 08:30.210
because she can't hold it
or pet it.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.212
I mean, you can't hug a fish.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.047
Something my parents should
have told me before giving me

08:34.081 --> 08:36.016
Guppy Goldberg-- may
she rest in peace.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.552
Maybe we should just get her a
pet that's cuddlier than a fish.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.054
You know? Something soft,
but durable.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.322
Like a pioneer woman.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.524
Okay, one, I was
talking about a hamster.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.360
Two, your Dr. Quinn fantasy
is not happening.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.832
(bell rings)

08:51.865 --> 08:54.101
It's a local telethon, Josie;
we don't have enough space

08:54.134 --> 08:55.669
to recreate The Hunger Games.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.370
You suck, Barney.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.139
Well, I...

09:00.240 --> 09:02.042
Oh, great, you're here.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.677
You and Virginia
ready to rehearse?

09:03.711 --> 09:05.245
Well, Virginia's not here yet.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.580
But she will be here soon,

09:06.614 --> 09:08.381
and I promise
we'll be ready to rock.

09:08.415 --> 09:09.883
This means a lot
to both of us.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.184
Oh, well, great.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.419
Well, let me know
when she arrives,

09:12.452 --> 09:14.087
because we're
rehearsing in order,

09:14.121 --> 09:17.224
and you're on right after
Dancin' Dan jumps the shark.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.692
Oh, come on, Barney.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.127
You know no one's
gonna be watching

09:20.160 --> 09:22.129
after Dancin' Dan
jumps the shark.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.197
Everyone will stop
watching long before that.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.433
Probably sometime during the
act when Seamus O'Flathery

09:26.466 --> 09:28.869
counts to a thousand
in a Mexican accent.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.138
WOMAN (over speakers):
Give a nice warm welcome to...

09:31.171 --> 09:33.874
Wow. Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.644
I thought "The Meat Locker" was
a weird name for a sports club.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.045
This makes a lot more sense.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.480
I tell my husband
I'm "playing squash"

09:40.513 --> 09:42.816
because I don't want him
to know I'm coming here.

09:42.850 --> 09:43.884
For business.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.885
Here's your meat money.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.253
Use it wisely.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.755
Well, thank you.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.257
Yeah, strip clubs aren't
really my idea of fun.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.960
We're here to entertain
the Nakamura sisters.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.795
Just help me
close the deal,

09:54.828 --> 09:56.897
and you'll be cruising
in one of those sweet

09:56.930 --> 09:59.266
pink company sedans in no time.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.769
I've always wanted the
status that goes along

10:01.802 --> 10:03.603
with riding around
town in one of those.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.305
Well, here's
your chance to get it.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.775
Now go over there
and show those Nakamura sisters

10:07.808 --> 10:09.609
how to have a good time.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.345
No problem. I speak
a little Japanese.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.547
Really?
Yeah.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.119
(Nakamura sisters laughing)

10:24.658 --> 10:26.927
(both laugh)

10:26.960 --> 10:28.662
(speaks Japanese)

10:30.563 --> 10:32.666
Spend 25 years watching
Japanese horror movies,

10:32.700 --> 10:34.434
you pick up a thing or two.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.837
Well...

10:40.573 --> 10:42.810
(kettle whistling)

10:45.212 --> 10:46.880
Hey, Virginia,
where have you been?

10:46.914 --> 10:48.381
(sighs)
I'm sorry, Burt.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.984
I know I missed rehearsal
for the telethon.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.653
Louise dragged me
to a male strip club.

10:53.687 --> 10:56.156
What? What about your fear
of man thongs?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.624
Louise says in order
to be successful

10:57.657 --> 10:59.159
you need to conquer your fears.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.794
Besides, they didn't keep 'em on
for very long.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.696
Hey, you remember
little Billy Watkins

11:02.730 --> 11:04.164
who used to live
down the street?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.666
Sure.
Well, he's all grown up now.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.836
Why would your boss take you
to a place like that?

11:08.869 --> 11:10.470
Because she's teaching me

11:10.503 --> 11:12.572
that business doesn't just
get done in the boardroom.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.475
It happens at the Steak House,
the Nineteenth Hole,

11:15.508 --> 11:16.844
and the Old Boys' Club,

11:16.877 --> 11:19.212
which, by the way,
are also male strip clubs.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.814
What Natesville lacks
in adult literacy,

11:20.848 --> 11:22.883
it makes up for
in adult entertainment.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.585
Louise thinks I have it in me
to be more than just crew chief.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.821
She thinks I could climb
all the way to the top.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.557
Apparently, there's a beautiful
glass ceiling up there.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.692
A glass ceiling?
That sounds dangerous.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.694
I'm surprised they'd let
a woman up there.

11:34.728 --> 11:35.729
Right?

11:35.763 --> 11:37.564
Anyway, I'm exhausted.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.499
Hey, we got
to practice our song.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.534
We'll be fine.
Oh, and I got to meet you

11:41.568 --> 11:43.771
at the telethon tomorrow. I got
a meeting at the Meat Locker.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.573
And before that we're gonna grab
a bite at the Sausage Factory,

11:46.606 --> 11:49.977
which I'm praying
is a breakfast place.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.781
(squeaking)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.382
Thanks again for
letting us use

11:55.415 --> 11:57.350
one of your mice
as a pet for Hope.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.853
And we promise, we'll make a
good home for Mr. Whiskers.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.189
Please. Mr. Whiskers
was his father.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.958
He prefers to be called Len.
Huh.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.260
I was gonna feed him
to my snake anyway.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.461
Doesn't naming him
make it harder

12:08.495 --> 12:09.729
to feed him to your snake?

12:09.763 --> 12:11.398
Some people feel that way,

12:11.431 --> 12:14.768
but I believe it gives him
a quiet dignity in death.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.037
Hey, Hope!

12:17.070 --> 12:18.939
You want to come meet
your new best friend?

12:19.807 --> 12:21.641
All right.

12:24.912 --> 12:25.979
Look, sweetie.

12:26.013 --> 12:27.948
Isn't it adorable?

12:27.981 --> 12:30.050
You want to touch him?
He doesn't bite.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.651
No.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.553
Whoa.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.055
Your kid is cold.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.824
Even I think Len's cute,

12:36.857 --> 12:40.027
and I was gonna watch him get
slowly digested over ten hours.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.331
Come on, Natesville.
If you donate over ten dollars,

12:44.364 --> 12:45.598
we'll send you this wonderful

12:45.632 --> 12:47.968
Howdy's tote bag.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.770
Son of a bitch! I think
that freakin' can broke my toe.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.405
You guys are
up next, Burt.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.741
But Virginia's not here yet.
I can't go on without her.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.143
Where is she?
I don't know.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
She promised
she'd be here.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.146
Well, she's not
and we can't wait.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.314
White Morgan Freeman
is almost finished miming

13:01.348 --> 13:04.184
all of regular Morgan Freeman's
greatest roles.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.586
See? He's done his
Driving Miss Daisy.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.957
And his Shawshank is just him
air-hugging Tim Robbins.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.660
Hey. Go tell Dancin' Dan
and the shark to get ready.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.330
Oh, come on.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.367
(rock music playing,
women whooping)

13:20.400 --> 13:21.701
Thanks, Jackhammer.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.203
Nice to see you, Mrs. Chance.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.605
You, too, Billy.
Tell your mom I said hi.

13:25.638 --> 13:26.940
Will do.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.508
So, like I was saying,

13:28.541 --> 13:30.310
Knock Knock Knock has

13:30.343 --> 13:33.280
the lowest prices,
the pinkest uniforms,

13:33.313 --> 13:37.417
and... we hate
dolphins, too.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.652
(quietly):
Hey, uh, FYI,

13:39.686 --> 13:41.955
the dolphin talk is kind
of a sensitive subject.

13:41.989 --> 13:43.623
Oh, gotcha. Yeah.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.159
So, um, hey, Pearl Harbor.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.629
What a great movie, huh?

13:49.662 --> 13:52.599
(laughter)

13:54.868 --> 13:57.070
You are killing it.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.974
Kyoko told me she wants to fly
us to Vegas on her father's jet.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.409
Hey, ladies,

14:02.442 --> 14:05.545
I think there might be
a storm front moving in,

14:05.578 --> 14:09.749
because here comes the rain!

14:09.782 --> 14:12.752
(whooping)

14:12.785 --> 14:15.255
How about you?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.589
No, no, no, no, no, no,

14:16.623 --> 14:19.526
no, no.
(chuckles)

14:21.594 --> 14:23.730
(gasps)
Oh, my God! I forgot!

14:23.763 --> 14:27.167
I-I have to go. Um, I'm supposed
to be at the telethon with Burt.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.269
You can't leave.
This is business.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.905
I'll just be a few minutes.
Really. I promised my husband.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.706
Husbands are expendable.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.275
You think Talon's
my first husband?

14:35.308 --> 14:38.245
He's not even my first Talon.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.214
Besides, you can do
a lot better than Burt.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.549
Now, you just stay put

14:42.582 --> 14:43.951
and earn that pink sedan.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.853
Listen, lady,
you can take that pink sedan

14:46.886 --> 14:49.456
and park it
in your brown garage.

14:49.489 --> 14:54.094
For your information,
my garage is bleached.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.763
I'm gonna give you one
more chance to sit down

14:56.796 --> 14:59.967
and let some strange man
rub his junk all over you,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.901
or you can forget
about that promotion.

15:01.935 --> 15:05.805
There's only one strange man
I let rub his junk on me,

15:05.838 --> 15:07.640
and that's my slow cousin
Jeffrey,

15:07.674 --> 15:09.209
because he doesn't know
any better.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.211
Did I make it?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.380
Yeah. Yeah, Dan, you made it.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.815
It's now or never. You and
Virginia are on, Burt.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.484
I can't. She's still not here.

15:17.517 --> 15:19.486
Well, we got to put
something on the air.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.621
Right now, the people
at home are just watching

15:21.654 --> 15:23.456
a dazed shark
eat a cape.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.125
The pledges have
stopped, Burt.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.726
We have got to move
that tote board.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.962
Wait. This is on TV.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.164
That means everything
has to work out.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.101
Virginia's gonna burst
through that door any second.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.970
Right... now!

15:38.338 --> 15:40.873
Or... now!

15:44.211 --> 15:45.478
Now?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.814
Geez, Burt, you're
bringing me down

15:47.847 --> 15:49.916
even more than that act
that was a six-year-old girl

15:49.949 --> 15:51.884
talking about her
parents' divorce.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.287
Nobody move.

15:54.321 --> 15:55.755
WOMAN:
It's the cops.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.524
This club is operating
without a license.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.993
We're gonna need statements
from all of you.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.461
(groans)
I can't believe this.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.663
I'm stuck
in the Meat Locker!

16:10.537 --> 16:12.439
(clears throat)
Uh...

16:12.472 --> 16:15.442
this is a little song
I usually sing with my wife.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.511
Tonight, I'm going solo.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.980
I think it should work out
just the same.

16:21.014 --> 16:24.184
("Don't Go Breaking My Heart"
playing)

16:34.094 --> 16:36.696
* Don't go breaking my heart

16:42.169 --> 16:45.505
* Oh, honey, if I get restless

16:51.111 --> 16:53.280
* Don't go breaking my heart

16:58.451 --> 17:02.122
* Oh, honey, when you knock
on my door... *

17:05.792 --> 17:07.527
Hey, Hope, look.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.996
Now that Len can follow you
in his go-ball,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.431
you two can be best friends!

17:11.464 --> 17:13.032
(sighs) Jimmy,
this is pointless.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.168
I really don't
think Hope cares.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.569
I mean,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.005
look at this drawing
that she's doing.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.507
JIMMY:
That's interesting.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.842
(sighs)
I'll call Frank to pick up Len.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.045
In the meantime, I'm gonna
move him somewhere safer.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.055
(screams, grunts)

17:36.089 --> 17:37.757
Oh, my God. Jimmy.
(Jimmy groans)

17:37.790 --> 17:38.858
Daddy!

17:38.891 --> 17:41.494
I'm okay.
(grunts)

17:42.462 --> 17:44.297
(groans)

17:44.331 --> 17:46.366
Oh.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.303
Well, she does care
about one stupid animal.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.271
(chuckles)

17:51.304 --> 17:53.573
Me.
(chuckles)

17:54.741 --> 17:55.942
Can we go to the concussion?

17:55.975 --> 17:57.577
I think I have a hospital.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.780
("Don't Go Breaking My Heart"
playing)

18:02.582 --> 18:05.718
* Don't go breaking my heart

18:05.752 --> 18:09.556
* I won't go breaking
your heart... *

18:09.589 --> 18:11.258
Okay, thank you,

18:11.291 --> 18:14.161
Burt Chance,
for those seven renditions

18:14.194 --> 18:15.662
of "Don't Go
Breaking My Heart."

18:15.695 --> 18:17.564
(quietly): People are taking
back their donations.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.732
(quietly): I'm sorry, Barney;
I thought she'd be here by now.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.935
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.837
I really screwed up
tonight.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.105
That's okay. I knew you'd come.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.674
No, it's not okay.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.509
I got so caught up in my job

18:29.542 --> 18:31.311
that I forgot
about what's important.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.613
Well, what about your promotion
and your pink car

18:33.646 --> 18:35.081
and your glass ceiling?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.849
None of that matters, Burt.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.686
I'm so sorry.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.490
I got seduced by the glamour of
assistant regional management.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.459
But I'm gonna
make a pledge.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.862
I'll never
stand you up again.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.931
WOMAN:
So sweet.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.201
(phones ringing,
indistinct conversations)

18:54.234 --> 18:56.836
Keep kissing!
People love it!

18:56.869 --> 18:59.572
Grope her for charity!
(chuckles)

19:00.840 --> 19:03.009
Do you mind singing
our song one last time?

19:03.042 --> 19:04.311
I'd love to.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.045
("Don't Go Breaking My Heart"
playing)

19:06.078 --> 19:08.047
(bell dinging)
BARNEY: Oh, yeah!

19:08.080 --> 19:10.049
We did it! We're all going home!

19:10.082 --> 19:12.018
Good night, Natesville!
Roll the credits!

19:12.051 --> 19:13.019
(chuckles)

19:13.052 --> 19:14.354
(crowd cheering)

19:14.387 --> 19:15.955
ANNOUNCER:
Thank you for your pledges.

19:15.988 --> 19:19.626
Make sure to visit
the Museum of Medical Devices.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.628
From here on out,
it's just Barney and Dan

19:21.661 --> 19:23.630
beating a shark to
death on live TV.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.332
But you didn't get
to sing your song together.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.467
The important thing is
we learned something

19:27.500 --> 19:29.802
about our relationship
that we wouldn't have learned

19:29.836 --> 19:31.204
if we'd never been on TV.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.039
Like I learned
that you can't

19:33.072 --> 19:35.475
let focusing on your job get
in the way of being together.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.977
And it worked out in a clever
and unexpected way

19:38.010 --> 19:39.912
because we did it
the way they do on TV.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.881
We didn't replace Hope's fish
with a look-alike,

19:41.914 --> 19:44.183
and everything worked out great
for us, too.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.853
Yeah. And it turns out
Hope does have compassion.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.488
She's just not
a pet person.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.923
You two did everything
the way they do it on TV.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.992
You just don't know it.
What you talking 'bout?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.895
Perhaps you remember a show
called That's My Munchkin.

19:55.928 --> 19:56.896
That's not a real show.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.097
Actually, it was.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.032
I loved That's My Munchkin.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.601
They only made four episodes,

20:01.634 --> 20:04.304
but Jimmy watched every one
about a thousand times.

20:09.942 --> 20:13.646
Don't worry, Buddy,
you'll be safe up here.

20:14.647 --> 20:17.517
(grunts)
Whoa!

20:17.550 --> 20:19.619
(canned laughter)

20:19.652 --> 20:21.354
Oh, no!

20:21.388 --> 20:24.491
Oh, my God, are you okay?

20:25.825 --> 20:26.893
Daddy!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.361
Well, looks like she does care

20:28.395 --> 20:29.929
about one stupid animal.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.798
Me.
(canned laughter)

20:31.831 --> 20:34.501
I love you, Daddy.
(audience aahing)

20:35.402 --> 20:37.904
That's my munchkin!

20:37.937 --> 20:39.372
(laughter, cheering)

20:39.406 --> 20:41.374
Now can we go to the concussion?

20:41.408 --> 20:43.142
I think I might have a hospital.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.512
(theme music playing,
laughter, applause)

20:48.515 --> 20:51.250
It's not the same.
That's just a coincidence.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.952
Maybe you're right.
I guess your lives

20:52.985 --> 20:55.355
really don't resemble
anything on TV.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.625
(all yawning)

20:58.658 --> 21:00.993
So, what's everybody
up to next week?

21:01.027 --> 21:02.429
Not much.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.896
I'm gonna pretend
to be Barney's girlfriend

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
while his moms come
to visit town.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.301
Hmm. I got to go meet my
pregnant friend in an elevator.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.769
We couldn't think
of anything new to do,

21:09.802 --> 21:11.438
so we're just gonna
make a family video.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.406
You know, clip together
some of our favorite moments

21:13.440 --> 21:15.308
from over the years.
That sounds boring.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.843
Oh, no. We're gonna talk
in between the clips

21:16.876 --> 21:18.110
to spice it up a little.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.314
Oh.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.115
VIRGINIA:
Raising Hope was not filmed

21:23.149 --> 21:25.117
in front
of a live studio audience.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.153
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

21:27.186 --> 21:28.355
(boat horn honks)

21:28.388 --> 21:30.289
MAN:
Josie crushed it.
