WEBVTT

00:06.531 --> 00:09.701
- Okay, kids.
The school play is coming up

00:09.801 --> 00:11.536
and I've written
the script myself.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.004
- Oh, no.

00:13.104 --> 00:15.773
- Now, who would like
to handout the scripts?

00:15.840 --> 00:17.675
- Um...
♪ I do ♪

00:17.775 --> 00:21.379
- Thank you, Blaze.
Your enthusiasm is a delight.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.214
- One for you. You're welcome.

00:23.314 --> 00:25.049
- "A Daffodil for Terence"?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.485
"A morose tale of anguish
and loss."

00:27.552 --> 00:29.187
Oh, this sounds horrible.
- Hey, Mr. B.

00:29.287 --> 00:30.488
Not to put a damper
on the whole thing,

00:30.555 --> 00:31.723
but can I sit this one out?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.358
I had a bad experience
last year.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.226
Remember I threw up
and I pooped simultaneously?

00:35.326 --> 00:36.494
They had to carry me off.

00:36.561 --> 00:38.563
- I remember it all too well,
Tom.

00:38.663 --> 00:42.534
But this year you only have
one line as the village idiot.

00:42.634 --> 00:43.902
- Village idiot?

00:44.002 --> 00:46.004
I mean, is that even
believable casting?

00:46.070 --> 00:47.505
- That seems right.
- Blaze, please.

00:47.572 --> 00:48.840
- I mean, I'll buy it.

00:48.907 --> 00:51.176
- If anything,
it's too on the nose.

00:51.242 --> 00:53.378
- Isn't there anything in there
for, like, the cool guy

00:53.478 --> 00:54.979
or some kind of assassin or?

00:55.046 --> 00:58.716
- Something about your face
just screams,

00:58.816 --> 01:02.220
"I'm an idiot
who lives in a village."

01:02.320 --> 01:03.755
- All right, I question
the casting choice

01:03.855 --> 01:05.256
but let me sleep on it.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.026
All right, so I'm playing
the village idiot, Lucian.

01:08.092 --> 01:09.327
So why don't you just read
the lines

01:09.394 --> 01:10.695
before that and I'll come in?

01:10.762 --> 01:12.330
- Okay.

01:12.397 --> 01:15.900
"And we shall run through
the daffodils forever more."

01:16.000 --> 01:20.438
"Enter Lucian, a real idiot.
He stands there stupidly."

01:20.538 --> 01:23.508
- Um, here are your slippers,
sir.

01:23.575 --> 01:25.376
Thanks, Ma.
That was a big help.

01:25.443 --> 01:27.345
- That's it? Where are
the rest of your lines?

01:27.412 --> 01:29.047
We're gonna do all your lines.
- No, that's it.

01:29.113 --> 01:30.748
I give him the slippers
and then I-I leave.

01:30.848 --> 01:32.784
- You hand off the slippers
and then you leave?

01:32.884 --> 01:35.787
Tom, I'ma be real with you.
If I'm gonna get dressed up,

01:35.887 --> 01:37.522
bath, and drive to that school

01:37.589 --> 01:40.091
to hear one line,
it better be a doozy.

01:40.191 --> 01:41.793
- No, no. No, no.
Don't get the pencil out.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.561
No.
Mr. B doesn't like rewrites.

01:43.628 --> 01:45.630
- It's a tweak.
- He said if we work off script

01:45.730 --> 01:46.965
he's gonna physically harm us.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.700
- I'm just putting this
in the script.

01:48.766 --> 01:50.435
It's not a rewrite,
it's a tweak.

01:50.535 --> 01:52.237
He said he's gonna
physically harm you?

01:52.303 --> 01:53.938
- He said it more than once.

01:54.038 --> 01:56.774
- When your line comes up,
this is what I want you to say.

01:56.874 --> 01:58.576
- I actually like that.
- Right?

01:58.643 --> 02:01.145
- Yeah, I think Mr. B is really
gonna see the humor in that.

02:02.814 --> 02:04.382
- All right, everyone.

02:04.449 --> 02:08.820
Welcome to our table read
for "A Daffodil for Terence."

02:08.920 --> 02:10.555
I hope you all love it.

02:10.622 --> 02:13.324
I really hope
some of you get it

02:13.424 --> 02:17.262
because some people
can be quite thick.

02:17.328 --> 02:18.830
- Is he looking at me?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.733
- Nelson will read
our stage directions

02:21.799 --> 02:25.270
and Blaze will be doing
double duty

02:25.336 --> 02:28.973
as both our lead
and also the cat.

02:29.073 --> 02:33.011
And now,
"A Daffodil for Terence."

02:33.111 --> 02:36.581
- Curtains open on a bleak café
in Denmark.

02:36.648 --> 02:38.116
The café is silent

02:38.182 --> 02:42.086
except for the wailing moan
of a depressed cat.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.762
- Such brave writing.

02:50.828 --> 02:54.699
- Valdemar stands defiantly
above the motionless corpse.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.835
Lucian enters
and discovers the carnage.

02:57.935 --> 03:01.873
- Um...uh...who farted?

03:01.973 --> 03:03.508
- What?

03:03.608 --> 03:05.810
- My script says "Who farted?"
Is that the right line?

03:05.877 --> 03:07.211
- Stop laughing.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.314
- That was hysterical.

03:09.380 --> 03:13.117
- This table read
is now canceled.

03:13.184 --> 03:14.719
And by the way, Denise,

03:14.819 --> 03:19.624
I <i>was</i> talking about you
because you're thick.

03:19.691 --> 03:21.326
You're slow.

03:21.392 --> 03:22.727
- What the hell?

03:22.827 --> 03:25.463
- All right, please calm down,
it's just a play.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.899
- I spent 18 years
on that script.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.568
And he adds one line
and he rewrites it

03:30.668 --> 03:32.503
so that it's a fart joke.

03:32.570 --> 03:34.072
- That was actually
my mom's rewrite.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.141
- Oh, so is she
a village idiot too?

03:37.208 --> 03:38.409
- No, very smart lady.

03:38.509 --> 03:41.079
- Perhaps this is
a family business.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.413
- You can't make money
doing that.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.182
- Let's try to encourage
these kids.

03:44.248 --> 03:45.516
That's what
I'm a principal for.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.353
Okay, Tom?
Seriously, you did great.

03:48.419 --> 03:50.021
- Thank you. It felt good.

03:50.088 --> 03:52.357
- Great? He did great?
- You gotta admit that he got

03:52.423 --> 03:54.025
the best reaction
of the play, okay?

03:54.092 --> 03:55.426
So I have a great idea.

03:55.526 --> 03:58.830
Let's recast
and have Tom play the lead.

03:58.896 --> 04:00.932
- You can't be serious.
- No, I'm not a lead.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.000
I like to blend in.
Don't put me up front.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.002
- Mr. B, tell Blaze
he's demoted

04:05.069 --> 04:07.271
and he'll play the cat.
That's fun.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.940
- Oh, no, Blaze won't be happy
with that.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.775
- He'll love it.
Meow. Meow.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.577
He can remember
his lines easier.

04:12.677 --> 04:14.212
- This is outrageous.

04:14.278 --> 04:18.282
You have no respect
for my work nor my direction.

04:18.383 --> 04:20.218
- I have a lot of respect
for your craft.

04:20.284 --> 04:22.787
And Tom, ask your mom
if she can look at the script

04:22.887 --> 04:25.056
and see if she can work in,
like, more fart jokes.

04:25.123 --> 04:26.624
- We're talking, like,
one per page or?

04:26.724 --> 04:28.126
- Fart it up.
- Oh, my God.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.394
- Fart it up.

04:33.131 --> 04:35.767
- Good God.

04:40.371 --> 04:42.540
- Oh.
Aren't you Tom's weird teacher?

04:42.607 --> 04:45.977
- I'm Mr. B
and I came to apologize.

04:46.077 --> 04:48.079
May I come in?
- Yeah, I guess.

04:48.146 --> 04:52.450
- Oh, wow. The decor
is spectacularly mundane.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.918
- Thank you.

04:53.985 --> 04:55.653
- Oh, hey, Mr. B.
Listen, uh,

04:55.753 --> 04:57.155
if you wanna recast,
that's fine.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.823
I don't--I don't even
wanna be in the play.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.559
- Tom, my hands are tied.
You have to be in the play.

05:01.626 --> 05:03.060
- Oh, okay.
So why are you here?

05:03.127 --> 05:05.730
- I've given this
a great deal of thought.

05:05.797 --> 05:08.566
What if I were to take you
under my wing

05:08.633 --> 05:10.735
and mold you in my image?

05:10.802 --> 05:12.003
- Oh, no. No, no.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.471
- Wouldn't you like to be

05:13.571 --> 05:16.174
a short little
ten-year-old Mr. B?

05:16.274 --> 05:17.842
- Not really, no.
That doesn't sound too good.

05:17.942 --> 05:19.744
- We have one week, Tom.
- Whoa.

05:19.811 --> 05:23.114
- And for that time, you will
live, eat,

05:23.181 --> 05:26.017
and breathe Mr. B.
- No, I don't wanna do that.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.752
- What, is he supposed to live
at your house?

05:27.819 --> 05:31.022
- This will be a seven day
acting boot camp...

05:31.122 --> 05:32.323
- Please stop talking.

05:32.423 --> 05:35.426
- Culminating with a trip
to Broadway.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.028
- I don't like where
this is going.

05:37.128 --> 05:40.698
- We'll take in a show,
meet my old acting friends

05:40.798 --> 05:45.169
and stop for nibbles at Oso.
And it's all on me.

05:45.269 --> 05:47.138
- Mom, say something.
- We're in.

05:47.205 --> 05:49.307
- We're in? No, sounds like
my worst nightmare.

05:49.373 --> 05:52.143
- But if it's a free dinner,
I feel like we have no choice.

05:52.210 --> 05:53.845
- Oh, this is not gonna be fun.

05:53.945 --> 05:55.446
- Louder, Tom.

05:55.513 --> 05:59.884
Never say a line
when you can over enunciate it.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.953
- "Ah, look at the daffodils."

06:02.019 --> 06:03.788
- Put your body into it.

06:03.855 --> 06:06.891
There's nothing
coming back at me, Tom.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.560
They called me Mr. B.
- Why?

06:09.660 --> 06:12.563
- Because I was
the mayor of Broadway.

06:12.663 --> 06:14.665
- Then you just started
teaching at a grade school?

06:14.732 --> 06:16.634
- Yes.
- Wow, look at that.

06:16.701 --> 06:20.004
- Back in the day
I owned this town.

06:20.071 --> 06:22.073
Tom, do you see
what he's doing?

06:22.173 --> 06:25.676
You have to make sure
every syllable is heard.

06:25.743 --> 06:27.078
- Shh. Shut up!

06:27.178 --> 06:29.247
- This is my gift to you.

06:29.347 --> 06:32.750
- "How to Act with Vigor
Volume 2."

06:32.850 --> 06:34.852
- On the roof of that building

06:34.919 --> 06:38.256
I made love
to Marcia Gay Harden.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.758
- Kind of a weird story
to tell a little kid.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.226
- Yeah, very weird.

06:42.326 --> 06:43.594
Let's get that free dinner.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.264
- Wow, this is so great.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.534
I haven't seen you
in, like, 30 years.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.904
- Seeing you again
makes me feel so alive.

06:53.004 --> 06:54.505
- Mm-hmm, yes.

06:54.572 --> 06:56.407
- Oh, wow, you guys were all
in acting school together?

06:56.507 --> 06:58.276
- Yeah, we--
- I was the star

06:58.376 --> 07:00.177
of the class,
but I have to say,

07:00.244 --> 07:03.381
my colleagues here
were very supportive.

07:03.447 --> 07:06.050
- Well, you know, I'm not sure
"star" is the word I'd use.

07:06.117 --> 07:08.419
- Gary, tell our friends here
the anecdote

07:08.519 --> 07:11.722
about the time
Daniel Day-Lewis saw me perform

07:11.789 --> 07:14.292
and said,
"Now, that is acting."

07:14.392 --> 07:16.427
- Did that happen?
I have no memory of that.

07:16.527 --> 07:19.297
- Tom, listen, I'm gonna run
to the little boys' room.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.299
If the waiter comes,
order me a martini

07:21.399 --> 07:24.635
with gherkins not olives
and tell him not to drown it

07:24.735 --> 07:27.905
in vermouth
like a bourgeois fool.

07:27.972 --> 07:29.974
- We'll just order
when you're back.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.311
- Tom, I want you to lean in
and listen to me.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.745
- Okay. What's up, Gary?

07:34.812 --> 07:37.982
- Whatever he's teaching you,
do the opposite.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.418
- Why? I thought he's the
best actor of his generation.

07:40.484 --> 07:42.153
- Who told you that?
- Him.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.988
- Yeah, he--he says it a lot.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.557
- Oh, he was terrible,
the worst.

07:46.624 --> 07:48.092
- Mm, I don't like this.

07:48.159 --> 07:49.994
- So he didn't--he didn't pass
on "The Godfather"

07:50.094 --> 07:51.796
'cause it was beneath him?

07:51.896 --> 07:54.832
- They wouldn't even let him
do background work

07:54.932 --> 07:55.800
in "Porky's."

07:55.900 --> 07:57.301
- This is a disaster.

07:57.401 --> 07:59.337
I just did a seven-day
boot camp with the guy.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.473
- Forget everything he
taught you and remember this--

08:02.573 --> 08:03.941
less is more.

08:04.008 --> 08:05.576
- Less is more.
Less of what?

08:05.643 --> 08:07.011
- A good actor can convey more

08:07.111 --> 08:09.080
with a look
than a thousand words.

08:09.146 --> 08:10.481
- It's all in your face.

08:10.581 --> 08:12.183
- Just show 'em my face,
and I'm done?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.852
- Yes, Tom. A subtle grimace...
- Ooh, I like that.

08:14.952 --> 08:18.122
- Or a menacing sneer.
- I have to admit--

08:18.189 --> 08:19.824
Gary does seem like he knows
what he's talking about.

08:19.924 --> 08:22.426
- I feel afraid,
but I'm also turned on.

08:22.493 --> 08:24.462
- It's weird that
he's still sneering,

08:24.528 --> 08:26.764
but it is--it is dramatic.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.135
- I mean,
I don't mean to boast,

08:31.202 --> 08:35.973
but I did train in New York
with a instructor named Gary.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.708
- Wow, cool.
- Incredible.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.111
- Had some nibbles at Orso.
The whole thing is just--

08:40.177 --> 08:41.712
- Thomas.
- Hey, Mr. B.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.214
It's the big night.
I'm ready to go.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.615
- Fantastic.

08:44.682 --> 08:46.851
Let's see what level
you're performing at.

08:46.951 --> 08:48.886
- Oh, you wanna run the lines?
- Yes, Thomas.

08:48.986 --> 08:50.888
- I wasn't planning on saying
any of the lines.

08:50.988 --> 08:52.323
- What are you talking about?

08:52.390 --> 08:54.325
- Your friend Gary
said less is more, so...

08:54.392 --> 08:56.227
- Tom, you need to talk.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.630
Acting requires talking.

08:59.697 --> 09:01.399
- Get it together.
- Ouch.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.802
Oh, no, your friend Gary said
all I have to do is this...

09:04.869 --> 09:06.737
- Who's Gary?
- Ouch.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.239
Can someone restrain
the cat, please?

09:08.339 --> 09:10.408
- Gary is an imbecile.
- What?

09:10.508 --> 09:14.745
- I have no choice but to step
in and play the part myself.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.914
- Oh, no, Mr. B, I don't know
if acting's your strong suit.

09:17.014 --> 09:20.518
- Tom, I am going on.
Give me the costume.

09:20.584 --> 09:23.187
- No, Mr. B, please. Please.
Hey, stop. Mr. B.

09:23.254 --> 09:27.591
- Get ready for a master class
in drama.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.393
- Not gonna lie,
I had more fun last year

09:29.493 --> 09:31.595
when I vomited
and pooped in my pants.

09:33.497 --> 09:35.099
<i>- Hey, folks,
quick update here--</i>

09:35.199 --> 09:36.934
<i>uh, there's been a bit
of a casting change.</i>

09:37.034 --> 09:40.404
<i>The lead will now be played
by our very own Mr. B,</i>

09:40.504 --> 09:42.206
<i>and Tom is back
to playing the village idiot.</i>

09:42.273 --> 09:43.607
<i>Okay, thanks so much.</i>

09:43.708 --> 09:44.709
- Hang on. What?

09:47.078 --> 09:50.414
- Our story begins
at a bleak café in Denmark.

09:50.514 --> 09:53.084
A lone cat moans
in the distance...

09:56.887 --> 10:00.725
- As a old man named Valdemar
enters frame.

10:00.791 --> 10:03.127
- A plague, you say?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.462
- Oh, my God.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.198
- Dear parents...

10:07.264 --> 10:09.567
We shall meet again.

10:09.633 --> 10:13.771
And we shall run
through the daffodils

10:13.871 --> 10:16.974
forever more.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.914
- What the hell was that?
- That sucked.

10:25.382 --> 10:26.984
- Are they saying "you"
or "boo"?

10:27.084 --> 10:30.588
- That was awful.
And I'm friends with that man.

10:30.654 --> 10:32.389
- Mr. B, can I give you
some acting tips real quick?

10:32.456 --> 10:35.493
- Well, you may as well, Tom.
Everybody else has.

10:38.229 --> 10:40.898
Tom, I'm afraid
you might be right.

10:40.965 --> 10:43.734
All right, you fucking idiots,

10:43.801 --> 10:46.837
we'll take it
from Valdemar's soliloquy.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.742
Terence, my dear, dear Terence,

10:51.809 --> 10:56.447
I must ask, and I must ask now.

10:56.514 --> 11:00.851
Who amongst
you lost wastrels...

11:00.951 --> 11:02.953
farted?

11:03.020 --> 11:04.855
- What the hell was that?

11:04.955 --> 11:06.757
- Get him off the stage.

11:06.824 --> 11:09.360
- Um, it's called comic relief,

11:09.460 --> 11:12.429
you soulless gnomes.

11:12.496 --> 11:15.499
- Man, who says "fart"
and don't get a laugh?

11:15.599 --> 11:17.768
- Yeah, he really butchered
my mom's dialogue.

11:17.835 --> 11:19.670
On paper,
that line was great.
