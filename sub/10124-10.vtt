WEBVTT

00:09.200 --> 00:10.400
CORY?

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
CORY!

00:11.400 --> 00:13.100
EIGHT SECONDS, MOM.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.200
OPEN THE DOOR. MY BAGS
ARE TEARING HERE.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.000
ALL RIGHT.
FOUR SECONDS.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.133
GEE, THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:24.667 --> 00:26.033
I'M NUKING MY SOCKS.

00:26.033 --> 00:28.934
IT'S THIS NEW IDEA
I HAVE.

00:28.934 --> 00:30.934
I LIKE PUTTING
ON WARM CLOTHES.

00:30.934 --> 00:35.667
I WAS GOING TO START
WITH MY UNDERWEAR,
BUT I WAS NERVOUS.

00:35.667 --> 00:39.100
COULD YOU HELP ME OUT
HERE, PLEASE?

00:39.100 --> 00:40.300
SURE.

00:40.300 --> 00:43.133
O.K. I GOT
THE CELERY AND
THE PEANUT BUTTER.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.300
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:44.300 --> 00:45.834
I'M DIPPING.

00:45.834 --> 00:48.200
YOU DON'T DO THAT.
THAT'S A NEW JAR.

00:48.200 --> 00:50.734
THE OLD JAR HAD
CELERY IN IT.

00:50.734 --> 00:53.467
YOU WERE SUCH
AN ADORABLE CHILD.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.000
HOW DID YOU GET LIKE THIS?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.500
GET LIKE WHAT?

00:59.133 --> 01:00.700
WHAT?

01:03.900 --> 01:06.934
SO MY MOM SAYS,
"TRY BEING POLITE
JUST ONE DAY

01:06.934 --> 01:08.967
AND SEE IF PEOPLE
DON'T NOTICE?"

01:08.967 --> 01:10.867
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU'RE POLITE.

01:10.867 --> 01:16.200
BUT POLITE IN MY FAMILY
MEANS WEARING A TIE
FOR YOUR ARRAIGNMENT.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.834
I APPRECIATE
YOUR QUICK RESPONSE

01:17.834 --> 01:20.400
WITH THE FIRE
EXTINGUISHER,
MR. MENDOZA,

01:20.400 --> 01:22.367
BUT IN THE FUTURE
PLEASE...

01:22.367 --> 01:24.133
WAIT FOR A FIRE.

01:26.133 --> 01:29.000
OH, BLESS YOU,
MR. FEENY.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.500
OH, THANK YOU.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.600
MR. MATTHEWS,

01:31.600 --> 01:33.467
THAT'S SURPRISINGLY
CONSIDERATE.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.667
GOOD. TELL MY MOTHER.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.967
NOW WATCH AS I SHIFT
INTO TURBO-POLITE.

01:44.734 --> 01:46.200
ERIC. ALLOW ME.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.000
O...K.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.133
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

01:51.133 --> 01:53.133
NO. I'LL TAKE IT
FROM HERE. THANKS.

01:53.133 --> 01:55.767
ALL RIGHT.
TELL MOM I OFFERED.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.800
NAAH!

01:56.800 --> 01:57.800
HEY!

01:57.800 --> 01:59.000
OH.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.500
SORRY.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.133
YOU O.K.?

02:02.133 --> 02:04.000
I DON'T KNOW.

02:06.934 --> 02:09.400
WHOA. TWICE
IN A ROW.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.233
YOU'RE A VERY
POLITE FELLA.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.767
THANK YOU.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.467
AND YOUR SMILE IS
KIND OF ENGAGING.

02:16.467 --> 02:20.500
YEAH. I USED THE TOOTHPASTE
WITH SWIRLS.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.800
HUMOROUS, TOO.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.100
YOU GOT
POSSIBILITIES.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.100
TURN AROUND.
LET ME LOOK AT YOU.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.100
I DON'T USUALLY GO
FOR VELCRO HEADS,

02:29.100 --> 02:31.300
BUT, ON YOU,
I DON'T KNOW,

02:31.300 --> 02:33.133
IT'S WORKING FOR ME.
GOT A NAME?

02:33.133 --> 02:34.700
UH...

02:34.700 --> 02:36.033
CORY.

02:36.033 --> 02:37.600
I'M THERESA.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.734
MY FRIENDS CALL ME T.K.

02:39.734 --> 02:40.800
NICE TO--

02:40.800 --> 02:43.500
OH, GOSH, I KNEW THIS
WAS GOING TOO WELL.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.867
CHILL.
IT'S A PEN.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.000
KEEP IN TOUCH.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.500
ALL RIGHT, COR.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.367
THAT GIRL.

02:56.367 --> 02:58.200
SHE WROTE SEVEN NUMBERS
ON MY HAND.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.400
WHAT COULD THAT
POSSIBLY MEAN?

03:00.400 --> 03:03.400
IT MEANS CALL HER.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.400
SHAWN,
HOW CAN I CALL HER
WHEN I DON'T HAVE--

03:07.400 --> 03:09.200
OHH-OH.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.033
T.K. AND I
TALKED ON THE PHONE
FOR TWO HOURS.

03:16.033 --> 03:20.133
IT BEATS MY PREVIOUS
TIME WITH A GIRL BY,
LIKE, TWO HOURS.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.000
SHE EVEN ASKED ME
TO THE MOVIES FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.767
<i>SHE </i>ASKED<i>YOU </i>OUT?

03:25.767 --> 03:28.734
YEP. AND I JUST MIGHT
LET HER TAKE ME.

03:28.734 --> 03:31.500
ALL RIGHT, HOMEROOM,

03:31.500 --> 03:33.300
UH... STAY AWAKE.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.734

03:34.734 --> 03:36.900
ALL STUDENTS INTERESTED
IN TRYING OUT

03:36.900 --> 03:38.467
FOR THE FAST-PACED
WORLD OF--

03:40.567 --> 03:42.000
YEAH.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.400
JUMPING TO RELEVANT STUFF--

03:43.400 --> 03:46.200
ITEM 11--DUE TO
A FREEZER MISHAP,

03:46.200 --> 03:50.600

YEAH!

03:51.767 --> 03:52.900
THANK YOU.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.934
THANK YOU.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.734

03:55.734 --> 03:56.967

HEY.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.600

03:58.600 --> 04:01.367
AHH, THERE HE IS.
THERE'S MY GUY.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.300
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,

04:04.300 --> 04:05.700
I GOT THIS THING HERE
CALLED HOMEROOM.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.400
YEAH, THIS NOTE
COVERS IT.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.367
T.K., WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN MY HOMEROOM?

04:10.367 --> 04:12.100
OUR HOMEROOM NOW,
SWEETIE.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.767
O.K., THERESA,
WELCOME ABOARD.

04:13.767 --> 04:15.000
PICK YOURSELF
A DESK.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.100
IS IT O.K.
TO SIT TWO TO A DESK?

04:18.100 --> 04:20.500
I'M THINKING NO.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.734
FOR A FIVE-SPOT?

04:33.300 --> 04:36.500
WELCOME HOME, CORY.
YOUR WREATH IS HERE.

04:38.100 --> 04:39.300
WOW, LOOK AT THAT.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.900
YES. THAT ALONE
WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXCESSIVE,

04:41.900 --> 04:43.033
BUT WAIT,
THERE'S MORE.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.600
YOUR VERY OWN
LIFE-SIZE
CANDY CLOWN.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.967
WHOA, CAN I PLAY
WITH HIM?

04:48.967 --> 04:51.767
SURE. AND THEN
YOU CAN EAT HIM.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.200
WHY CAN'T LIFE
ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.867
NOW IT'S TIME
TO TELL
YOUR PARENTS...

04:57.867 --> 04:59.600
WHO'S T.K.?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.033
SHE'S THIS GIRL
WHO KIND OF LIKES ME.

05:02.033 --> 05:03.967
NO KIDDING.

05:03.967 --> 05:05.600
THANKS TO YOU, MOM.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.033
HOW ARE YOU
PAWNING THIS OFF
ON ME?

05:08.033 --> 05:09.600
YOU TOLD ME TO BE POLITE,

05:09.600 --> 05:14.000
SO YESTERDAY A GIRL DROPPED
HER BOOK, I PICKED IT UP,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.233
AND--BOOM--
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.567
[DOORBELL CHIMES]

05:17.567 --> 05:19.567
I'M IN ONE, TOO.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.467
WITH THIS GUY.

05:23.467 --> 05:24.767
TONY,
YOU'RE BACK.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.834
MORE STUFF FOR
THE KID, ALAN.

05:26.834 --> 05:29.700
SIGN HERE, RIGHT
UNDER YOUR OTHER
THREE SIGNATURES.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.033
BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW THE ROUTINE.

05:32.033 --> 05:33.367
"WITH LOVE, T.K."

05:33.367 --> 05:35.967
CORY, WHAT'S WITH
THIS GIRL?

05:35.967 --> 05:39.700
SHE'S VERY SENTIMENTAL.
YOU KNOW--FLOWERS, CANDY.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.300
SIRLOIN STEAKS?

05:43.200 --> 05:45.133
NOTHING SAYS
"I LOVE YOU"

05:45.133 --> 05:48.000
LIKE A BEAUTIFUL
PIECE OF MEAT.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.233
TONY, PLEASE!

05:49.233 --> 05:51.600
THIS GIRL'S
TRYING TO BUY
YOUR AFFECTIONS.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.400
SO LET HER.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.467
DO YOU MIND?

05:54.467 --> 05:57.200
ALAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW ME
WELL ENOUGH

05:57.200 --> 05:58.667
TO KNOW
WHEN I'M KIDDING.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.900
I THINK
THIS GIRL'S COMING ON

06:00.900 --> 06:03.500
A LITTLE TOO STRONG,
A LITTLE TOO FAST,

06:03.500 --> 06:05.700
AND, MAN, THESE
WILL BARBECUE GREAT.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.700
ALAN.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.233
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TOO FAST?

06:08.233 --> 06:12.400
THIS IS SOMETHING
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN
AND DISCUSS.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.700
SHE'S RIGHT.
LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.867
I'LL GO FIX US
A NICE STEAK.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.367
I'LL FIND THE WAY.

06:21.133 --> 06:26.033
THEY SENT A WREATH?
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD
THEM ROSES.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.200
TIME'S UP.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.500
HE'LL CALL YOU BACK.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.367
LOOK, T.K.,
IT'S REALLY ALL RIGHT.

06:30.367 --> 06:33.000
I GOT THE STEAKS
AND THE CANDY CLOWN.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.033
THE FUZZY YARN HEAD
MADE ME THINK OF YOU.

06:36.033 --> 06:39.233
YOU REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
SENDING ME THINGS.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.767
OF COURSE I DO.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.233
YOU'RE MY GUY.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.567
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LADYLIKE.

06:44.567 --> 06:45.834
PUT TONY ON!

06:45.834 --> 06:47.100
TONY, WREATHS
AIN'T ROSES!

06:47.100 --> 06:49.834
DO I GOTTA COME
DOWN THERE MYSELF

06:49.834 --> 06:51.233
AND STRAIGHTEN
YOU OUT?

06:51.233 --> 06:53.900
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF--

06:53.900 --> 06:55.133
OH, IT'S YOU.

06:55.133 --> 06:57.467
IT'S ALWAYS ME.

06:57.467 --> 06:58.767
LISTEN, I'M SO--

06:58.767 --> 07:00.967
I'M SO
VERY, VERY SORRY.

07:00.967 --> 07:02.200
YOU LIKE THAT, FRANKIE?

07:02.200 --> 07:05.033
I BUMP INTO THIS GUY,
AND HE APOLOGIZES.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.967
THAT'S POLITE.
ISN'T THAT POLITE?

07:06.967 --> 07:09.300
WAIT, YOU'RE SAYING
<i>YOU </i>BUMPED INTO<i>ME?</i>

07:09.300 --> 07:11.400
THAT'S HOW I SAW IT.
HIS FAULT ENTIRELY.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.567
I ONLY HOPE YOU
CAN FIND A WAY
TO FORGIVE ME.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.100
BUT WHAT ABOUT
YOUR SHIRT?

07:17.100 --> 07:20.400
NO BIG DEAL.
THERE'S PLENTY MORE LIKE IT.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.467
HEY, YOU!

07:21.467 --> 07:22.767
SHIRT.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.033
COME ON. COME ON.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.000
HEY.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.700
SOME THINGS
I DELIVER MYSELF.

07:32.700 --> 07:33.934
I'LL GET MY COAT.

07:33.934 --> 07:35.400
YOU'LL WALK ME HOME.

07:40.000 --> 07:40.834
HEY, CORY.

07:40.834 --> 07:42.800
HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.967
CORY?

07:44.967 --> 07:46.600
THAT'S YOUR NAME,
AIN'T IT?

07:46.600 --> 07:51.800
YEAH, BUT USUALLY AS
YOU'RE SHOVING ME ASIDE,
YOU CALL ME BABOON.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.367
THAT WAS THEN.

07:53.367 --> 07:54.233
THIS IS...

07:54.233 --> 07:55.400
NOT THEN.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.500
HAVE
A NICE DAY...

07:57.500 --> 07:58.600
CORY.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.467
YOU, TOO...

08:01.467 --> 08:02.500
HARLEY.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.400
MAN, THIS POLITENESS
THING'S REALLY CATCHING ON.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.800
AHH, MR. MATTHEWS.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.834
JUST THE MAN
I WANTED TO SEE.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.734
PERHAPS
YOU COULD TELL ME

08:16.734 --> 08:19.000
THE MEANING
OF THIS MASTERPIECE?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.200
"T.K. LOVES C.M."

08:22.200 --> 08:24.567
NOW, WHAT COULD THAT
POSSIBLY STAND FOR?

08:24.567 --> 08:27.233
WELL, I THINK
SOMEONE NAMED T.K.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.100
APPARENTLY LOVES, UM...

08:30.500 --> 08:32.734
CORN MUFFINS?

08:32.734 --> 08:35.567
LIKE TO TAKE
ANOTHER SHOT AT THAT,
MR. MATTHEWS?

08:35.567 --> 08:37.734
NO, SIR,
THAT WAS MY BEST.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.300
SEE YOU
IN DETENTION?

08:39.300 --> 08:41.767
YES. IT SEEMS UNAVOIDABLE.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.867
VERY SUBTLE.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.967
SHAWN, SHE'S OBSESSIVE.
SHE'S CRAZY.

08:47.967 --> 08:50.133
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO ME?

08:50.133 --> 08:52.600
JUST RELAX, COR.
TELL HER TO SLOW DOWN.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.934
YOUR DATE TONIGHT--
CANCEL IT.

08:54.934 --> 08:56.367
SO, LIKE MY ARTWORK, FUZZY?

08:56.367 --> 09:00.100
I'M HAVING A MATCHING ONE
TATTOOED OVER MY HEART.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.834
UH, NO. NO. PLEASE

09:01.834 --> 09:04.600
LOOK, ABOUT OUR DATE
TONIGHT...

09:04.600 --> 09:06.467
ALL SET. I GOT
THE MOVIE TICKETS,

09:06.467 --> 09:10.300
MADE THE DINNER RESERVATIONS--
UNDER THE NAME FUZZY.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.700
UM...

09:11.700 --> 09:13.767
TONIGHT'S NOT GOOD.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.400
O.K. TOMORROW NIGHT.

09:16.734 --> 09:18.200
LOOK...THERESA...

09:18.200 --> 09:20.867
I THINK YOU'RE
A REALLY NICE PERSON.

09:20.867 --> 09:22.567
YOU'RE GOING TO
BAIL ON ME?

09:22.567 --> 09:25.767
NO. I JUST NEED
SOME TIME.

09:25.767 --> 09:28.300
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.900
I UNDERSTAND THAT NO MATTER
HOW MUCH YOU GIVE
TO SOME PEOPLE,

09:31.900 --> 09:34.700
THEY'LL STILL
STAB YOU IN THE BACK.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.567
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DIFFERENT.

09:36.567 --> 09:39.400
BUT YOU'RE LIKE
EVERY OTHER GUY
I EVER MET.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.200
I'LL SEE YA.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.767
SHAWN, SHE WAS
REALLY UPSET.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.734
MAYBE I SHOULD GO
APOLOGIZE.

09:50.734 --> 09:53.500
NO. THIS POLITENESS THING'S
PULLING YOU DOWN, MAN.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.400
TILL THIS BLOWS OVER,
GO RUDE.

09:57.734 --> 09:59.867
LISTEN, I--I'M SORRY.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.600
I WAS TEACHING WHILE
YOU WERE TALKING.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.100
MY MISTAKE.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.200
NO PROBLEM.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.734
GUYS, WHILE YOU'RE HERE
IN MY CLASS,

10:07.734 --> 10:10.800
WHATEVER PERSONAL STUFF
YOU GOT GOING ON--

10:10.800 --> 10:12.934
CHECK IT AT THE DOOR.

10:12.934 --> 10:15.300
YO. YOU MR. TURNER?
JANITOR BUD WANTS TO
SEE YOU.

10:15.300 --> 10:19.000
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS
TRUCK RUNNING OVER
YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.100
MY BIKE?

10:20.100 --> 10:21.033
OHH.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.467
READ POEMS.

10:25.934 --> 10:28.300
O.K., EVERYBODY
OUT IN THE HALL.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.233
LET'S GO,
MOVE IT ALONG,

10:30.233 --> 10:31.600
NO TALKING,
SINGLE FILE.

10:35.400 --> 10:38.300
EVERYBODY BUT YOU,
BABOON.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.400
FRANKIE, YOU AND JOEY
WATCH THE DOOR.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.233
I AM EXTREMELY
DISTRAUGHT.

10:45.233 --> 10:48.300
DO YOU HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHY?

10:48.300 --> 10:49.667
YES.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.300
SOMEONE HAS STOLEN
THE SWEET,
ANGELIC SMILE

10:52.300 --> 10:55.200
FROM THE FACE
OF MY SISTER.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.233
THERESA.

10:56.233 --> 10:57.834
YOUR SISTER?

10:57.834 --> 10:59.734
YOU MEAN T.K.'s...

10:59.734 --> 11:01.100
THERESA KINER.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.600
AND NOBODY BREAKS
THE HEART

11:03.600 --> 11:06.400
OF HARLEY KINER'S
SWEET BABY SISTER.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.667
I SWEAR I HAD NO IDEA
SHE WAS YOUR SISTER.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.100
YOU DO REALIZE
YOU'D BE DEAD ALREADY

11:17.100 --> 11:19.200
EXCEPT THERESA SAYS
YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.967
LUCKY FOR YOU,
AND YOUR KNEECAPS,

11:20.967 --> 11:24.133
I DEEM THIS A VERY RARE
AND DESIRABLE QUALITY.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.400
THEREFORE, I AM WILLING
TO LET YOU

11:26.400 --> 11:29.300
TAKE THERESA
TO THE MOVIES
TONIGHT AS PLANNED.

11:29.300 --> 11:32.400
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY
DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.934
NO, YOU REALLY DO.

11:35.367 --> 11:37.133
O.K.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.867
THIS WILL BE
A NICE, POLITE DATE.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.867
YOU WILL BE
A PERFECT GENTLEMAN.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.834
OTHERWISE, BABOON,
YOUR NEXT AND FINAL
DATE

11:45.834 --> 11:47.567
IS WITH FRANKIE.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.367
AND DON'T EXPECT
FLOWERS.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.567
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THIS'LL WORK.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.867
BLACK SHOES,
WHITE SOCKS,
BOW TIE.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.600
SHOULD DO IT.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.567
ERIC,

12:03.567 --> 12:05.000
HOW DO I LOOK?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.500
LIKE A VENTRILOQUIST'S
DUMMY.

12:10.133 --> 12:11.200
PERFECT.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.800
I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A DATE,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.133
BUT APPARENTLY YOU'RE
GOING TO SEARS

12:14.133 --> 12:15.900
TO TAKE PICTURES
FOR GRANDMA.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.934
THIS IS FOR MY DATE.

12:17.934 --> 12:20.300
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE'S TOTALLY UNAPPEALING.

12:20.300 --> 12:22.000
GOOD.
PLAY YOUR STRENGTHS.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
[DOORBELL CHIMES]

12:24.300 --> 12:26.033
SHE'S HERE.
STAY WITH ME.

12:26.033 --> 12:28.200
WHAT'S THE WORSE
THAT COULD HAPPEN?

12:32.700 --> 12:33.934
IT IS TIME.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.033
I GOT A DATE
WITH FRANKIE!

12:38.600 --> 12:40.734
MISS KINER'S
WAITING IN THE CAR

12:40.734 --> 12:42.133
TO GO TO THE MOVIES.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.367
OH, THAT'S BETTER.
NO, IT'S NOT.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.000
SHE'LL SEE THROUGH
THIS OUTFIT.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.467
I'M GOING OUT IN A BOW TIE,
COMING BACK IN A BOX.

12:49.467 --> 12:52.133
MISS KINER
DOESN'T LIKE TO MISS
THE COMING ATTRACTIONS,

12:52.133 --> 12:54.100
FUZZY.

12:57.767 --> 13:01.033
ANY LAST WORDS
FOR MOM AND DAD?

13:01.033 --> 13:02.700
TELL MOM...

13:02.700 --> 13:04.400
POLITENESS KILLS.

13:05.667 --> 13:06.900
AFTER YOU.

13:10.567 --> 13:12.200
HEY!

13:12.200 --> 13:14.000
FRANKIE! I'M DATING HERE!

13:14.000 --> 13:15.233
AND I'M CHAPERONING.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.700
OHH! WILL YOU
TALK TO HIM?

13:17.700 --> 13:21.033
SURE. HE ALWAYS
LISTENS TO ME.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.734
SO, UH, FRANKIE...

13:22.734 --> 13:23.834
NICE HAT.

13:23.834 --> 13:24.867
SHUT UP.

13:24.867 --> 13:25.867
YES, SIR.

13:25.867 --> 13:28.000
FRANKIE,
BE A GOOD GUY, HUH?

13:28.000 --> 13:31.233
GO PLAY ON THAT
SWING SET OVER THERE.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.500
THIS I CANNOT DO.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.000
OOH-OOH.
DANCING SNACKS.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.900
I LOVE THE DANCING
SNACKS.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.100
HERE.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.600
MAKE A DREAM COME TRUE.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.133
HARLEY GAVE ME
ORDERS.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.967
OOH, THE SNO-CAPS
ARE DOING THE CHA CHA.

13:45.967 --> 13:50.133
I THINK THEY'RE SAVING
THE LAST DANCE FOR YOU,
FRANKIE.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.567
OUT OF MY WAY.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.300
ALONE AT LAST.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.300
UH, T.K.,
I'M REALLY THIRSTY.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.100
I'LL GO GRAB US
SOME DRINKS.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.867
SAVE YOUR STRENGTH.
JUST SIT THERE
LOOKING GOOD,

14:02.867 --> 14:04.500
BUT LOSE THIS.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.934
HAHH.

14:09.133 --> 14:10.800
SHAWN, HOW'D YOU
GET HERE?

14:10.800 --> 14:14.600
I LIVE
JUST OVER THE FENCE.
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

14:14.600 --> 14:17.133
SHE'S ALL OVER ME.
HOW DO I STOP HER?

14:17.133 --> 14:18.567
NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM
BEFORE.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.567
HOW DO YOU NORMALLY
STRIKE OUT?

14:20.567 --> 14:23.200
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S USUALLY
SO EASY.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.867
HOP ON MY BIKE.
GET OUT OF HERE.

14:25.867 --> 14:29.300
DITCH HARLEY KINER'S
SISTER ON A DATE?
ARE YOU MENTAL?

14:29.300 --> 14:30.367
TOO LATE.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.133
SO...

14:35.133 --> 14:36.734
WHERE WERE WE?

14:36.734 --> 14:37.767
OH, YEAH.

14:37.767 --> 14:39.600
WAIT. COULDN'T WE
KIND OF TALK?

14:39.600 --> 14:41.867
O.K., LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOU AND ME.

14:41.867 --> 14:44.600
NO, LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

14:44.600 --> 14:45.667
LIKE, UH...

14:45.667 --> 14:46.667
BASEBALL.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.100
I HATE BASEBALL.

14:48.100 --> 14:50.467
MAD ABOUT THE STRIKE, HUH?
LET IT GO.

14:50.467 --> 14:56.200
ME AND MY BROTHER ERIC
WENT TO, LIKE, 10 PHILLIES
GAMES LAST YEAR.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.900
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:59.133 --> 15:00.700
THERESA?

15:00.700 --> 15:03.033
LOOK, I WAS AT
A PHILLIES GAME ONCE,

15:03.033 --> 15:05.934
AND I DIDN'T HAVE
A GOOD TIME, O.K.?

15:05.934 --> 15:07.567
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.100
YOU WANT TO KNOW?

15:11.100 --> 15:13.600
YEAH. I WANT TO KNOW.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.734
O.K.

15:14.734 --> 15:17.400
YOU'LL GET A KICK
OUT OF THIS ONE.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.500
MY OLD MAN...

15:18.500 --> 15:21.367
MY REAL DAD,
YOU KNOW?

15:21.367 --> 15:24.033
ON MY 8th BIRTHDAY,
HE TOOK ME
TO A PHILLIES GAME.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.967
IT WAS SO GREAT
BEING THERE,
JUST ME AND HIM.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.700
HE EVEN ARRANGED IT
SO MY NAME FLASHED
ON THE SCOREBOARD.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.600
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.867
YEAH, IT WAS.

15:33.867 --> 15:37.000
TILL HE STARTED
CHATTING IT UP
WITH THIS REDHEAD.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.200
HE ACTED LIKE
I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

15:40.200 --> 15:43.767
7th INNING STRETCH,
THEY WENT TO BUY
SOME BEERS.

15:43.767 --> 15:45.700
I NEVER SAW HIM
AGAIN.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.233
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE 8 YEARS OLD,

15:48.233 --> 15:49.567
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY...

15:49.567 --> 15:51.400
AND THE JERK
DITCHED ME.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.000
I SAT THERE FOR HOURS
LIKE AN IDIOT

15:54.000 --> 15:55.767
WITH MY STUPID
SOUVENIR HAT,

15:55.767 --> 15:59.000
TILL ONE OF
THE BALLPARK GUYS
CALLED MY MOM.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.300
SHE WAS SORT OF
UNDER THE WEATHER,

16:01.300 --> 16:04.667
SO HARVEY RODE HIS BIKE
DOWN TO GET ME.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.500
WHO?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.300
HARVEY, MY BROTHER.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.367
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S EVER
LOOKED OUT FOR ME.

16:11.367 --> 16:15.100
WAIT, YOU'RE TELLING ME
HARLEY KINER'S REAL
NAME IS HARVEY?

16:15.100 --> 16:18.200
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO
GETS TO CALL HIM THAT.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.200
HARVEY.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.467
THE SINGLE MOST FANTASTIC
THING I'VE EVER HEARD.

16:24.467 --> 16:28.400
AND I CAN'T TELL ANYONE,
'CAUSE HE'D KILL ME.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.500
[CHUCKLES]

16:29.500 --> 16:30.500
YEAH.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.834
OOH, YEAH,
HE WOULD.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.967
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:37.967 --> 16:39.567
I LIKE YOU, CORY.

16:39.567 --> 16:40.734
I LIKE YOU, TOO.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.000
WELL, THEN,
COME ON, KISS ME.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.233
I'M SAYING IT'S O.K.

16:44.233 --> 16:47.400
NO, I THINK WE SHOULD
GET TO BE FRIENDS,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.300
SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.100
I'M NOT
THAT KIND OF GIRL.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.300
AAH!

16:54.300 --> 16:56.567
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO MY SISTER?

16:56.567 --> 16:59.400
LOOK, HARVEY, I CAN
EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.400
YOU'D BETTER--

17:00.400 --> 17:01.600
HARVEY?
YOU TOLD HIM?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.767
OH, YOU'RE SO
DEAD, BABOON.

17:03.767 --> 17:06.033
NO, LEAVE HIM ALONE.
COME ON!

17:06.033 --> 17:09.000
THERESA,
NOT THE FACE,
NOT THE FACE!

17:09.000 --> 17:11.033
GET ME OUT, HUNTER!
COME ON, SHAWN!

17:11.033 --> 17:14.233
GREAT. SAY MY WHOLE NAME.
HARVEY WILL GET ME, TOO.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.800
I'LL FIND YOU,
BABOON!

17:15.800 --> 17:18.033
AND WHEN I DO,
YOU'RE DEAD!

17:18.033 --> 17:20.400
HE SAID "HARVEY."
WHO COULD THAT BE?

17:22.233 --> 17:23.767
OHH.

17:29.734 --> 17:30.767
COR...

17:30.767 --> 17:33.300
HERE ARE THE NOTES
FROM FOURTH PERIOD.

17:33.300 --> 17:35.767
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE
IN THERE?

17:35.767 --> 17:38.133
JUST SLIP MY DIPLOMA
THROUGH THE GRATE.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.233
WAIT A MINUTE.

17:42.900 --> 17:44.967
SHAWN, WHAT KIND OF
NOTES ARE THESE?

17:44.967 --> 17:47.500
YOU'VE GOT DOODLES
AND TIC-TAC-TOE

17:47.500 --> 17:49.834
AND A PIECE
OF CHEWED GUM?

17:49.834 --> 17:52.500
GREAT. YOU TOUCHED IT.
NOW I CAN'T EAT IT.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.133
IT'S BAD ENOUGH BREATHING
YOUR GYM SOCKS.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.300
GET ME SOME NOTES--

17:57.734 --> 17:59.200
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.967
COME OUT, COME OUT,
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

18:06.967 --> 18:09.734
LOOK, HARLEY,
IT'S ONLY FAIR TO WARN YOU--

18:09.734 --> 18:12.367
I AM WIRED TO EXPLOSIVES
IN HERE.

18:12.367 --> 18:16.000
YOU PULL ME OUT,
THIS WHOLE SCHOOL
BLOWS SKY-HIGH.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.900
OOH!

18:18.900 --> 18:20.400
HEY,
THAT'S MY FRIEND.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.400
AND THIS IS
MY LOCKER.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.600
I NEED A MOMENT ALONE
WITH BABOON.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.934
GUYS, GO TO CLASS.

18:27.934 --> 18:29.300
CLASS?
GOOD ONE, HARLEY.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.767
LIKE WE'D BE CAUGHT DEAD
IN CLASS.

18:32.767 --> 18:33.767
GO.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.200
O.K.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.400
LOOK, HARLEY, GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.

18:38.400 --> 18:43.033
I TRUSTED YOU
TO TAKE MY SISTER
ON A NICE, POLITE DATE.

18:43.033 --> 18:44.367
AND YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE

18:44.367 --> 18:46.133
OF THAT SWEET,
INNOCENT CHILD.

18:46.133 --> 18:50.200
I WAS NOT THE ONE
MAKING THE MOVES.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.133
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
BABOON?

18:52.133 --> 18:54.600
[SHAWN] I'M RIGHT
BEHIND YOU, BUDDY.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.500
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME.
I SWEAR.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.100
YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE

18:59.100 --> 19:02.734
MY ANGELIC BABY SISTER
ACTUALLY CAME ON
TO<i>YOU?</i>

19:02.734 --> 19:05.100
HARLEY, I WOULDN'T
MAKE THIS UP.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.033
IT'S THE TRUTH.
BELIEVE ME.

19:10.900 --> 19:14.400
ANY OF YOU GUYS KNOW
A GIRL NAMED T.K.?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.500
IS SHE FAST
LIKE HE SAYS?

19:17.500 --> 19:18.900
OH, YEAH.
OH, YEAH.

19:18.900 --> 19:22.400
YOU GUYS KNOW THE "K"
IN T.K.?

19:22.400 --> 19:24.300
IT STANDS FOR MY SISTER.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.467
OH, NO.
OH, NO.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.800
THIS IS VERY
DISCONCERTING.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.000
LOOK, HARLEY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY

19:35.000 --> 19:36.800
SHE'S A BAD PERSON.
SHE'S NOT.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.100
I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:38.100 --> 19:42.300
YOU TRY
AND DO GOOD BY 'EM,
RAISE 'EM RIGHT,

19:42.300 --> 19:44.767
BUT I GUESS
IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.767
YOU KNOW, YOUR SISTER
LOVES YOU A LOT.

19:47.767 --> 19:50.233
SHE TOLD ME
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

19:50.233 --> 19:52.867
THAT'S ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR HER.

19:52.867 --> 19:55.133
YET IT SEEMS
I'VE FAILED HER.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.300
IT'S THE PRESSURES,
YOU KNOW?

19:57.300 --> 19:59.100
THE DEMANDS OF MY DAY.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.600
I'M SO BUSY COLLECTING
LUNCH MONEY,

20:01.600 --> 20:03.400
DUNKING KIDS' HEADS
INTO TOILETS,

20:03.400 --> 20:06.600
I HARDLY HAVE TIME
FOR MY SISTER ANYMORE.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.367
YOU DO THE BEST
YOU CAN.

20:09.367 --> 20:10.700
YEAH,

20:10.700 --> 20:12.200
BUT SHE NEEDS MORE.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.967
SHE JUST NEEDS SOMEBODY
TO SET A GOOD EXAMPLE
FOR HER.

20:15.967 --> 20:20.467
YOU'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO BE THE BIGGEST
INFLUENCE IN HER LIFE.

20:20.467 --> 20:23.000
YEAH. I COULD
TALK TO HER.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.600
SET HER STRAIGHT
A LITTLE.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.500
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT,
NOT WHO SHE'S DATING.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.200
WELL, PERSONALLY,
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
SHE'D DATE YOU.

20:33.834 --> 20:36.767
OF COURSE, THAT'S
UP TO YOU AND T.K.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.033
BUT IF YOU DO
GO OUT AGAIN,

20:39.033 --> 20:42.000
YOU TAKE HER
SOMEWHERE NICE, EH?

20:42.000 --> 20:44.667
SEE, MY SISTER--
SHE DESERVES IT.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.500
SO, HARLEY...

20:49.500 --> 20:53.033
DOES THIS MEAN ME
AND YOU, WE'RE O.K.?

20:53.033 --> 20:54.400
NO.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.100
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.000
[LOCKER DOOR LATCH RATTLES]

21:11.000 --> 21:13.100
[SHAWN]
YOU AIN'T NOTHING, KINER!

21:13.100 --> 21:15.700
I AIN'T AFRAID
OF YOU EITHER.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.767
I JUST...

21:16.767 --> 21:18.100
[DOOR LATCH RATTLES]

21:18.100 --> 21:20.800
CAN'T GET OUT
OF THIS LOCKER.

21:20.800 --> 21:22.033
CORY?

21:30.600 --> 21:31.300

AND CAREFULLY]

SO HOW'S THE NEW ME
COMING ACROSS, FUZZY?

21:48.233 --> 21:49.734
DOING GREAT.

21:49.734 --> 21:52.867
UH-OH, THIS GUY'S
MISSING A CLAW.

21:52.867 --> 21:56.400
THAT'S IT! I TOLD HIM
THESE ARE IMPORTANT PEOPLE!

21:56.400 --> 21:57.800
THIS IS A VERY BIG
DINNER FOR ME.
