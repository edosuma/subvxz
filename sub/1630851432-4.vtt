WEBVTT

00:20.020 --> 00:22.939
Remember to be at my house
by dinner to babysit Sawyer.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.650
Mom and Dad have a date night. Urgh.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.152
-Hey, girls.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.280
Hey, Wyatt.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.073
You guys up to something exciting?

00:32.157 --> 00:33.158
No.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.201
Just babysitting my little brother.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.453
Hm.

00:36.536 --> 00:38.538
Cool bike, Lucy!

00:38.621 --> 00:39.998
Somebody thinks so.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.126
Come on!

00:44.961 --> 00:46.796
Are we going to the park, Lucy?

00:46.880 --> 00:50.258
Take me to the park.
Take me to the park. Park, park!

00:50.341 --> 00:51.342
Okay Sawyer,

00:51.426 --> 00:54.471
promise you're gonna be a good boy
for your sister and her friends?

00:54.554 --> 00:55.889
Yes, Mommy.

00:55.972 --> 00:56.890
Okay.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.934
See, Lucy? I don't know what
you're worried about. He's an angel.

01:00.018 --> 01:03.646
-All. An. Act.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.608
Okay. Have fun, but not too much fun.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.902
Thank you for babysitting. Let's go.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.362
-Date night! Whoo!
-Whoo!

01:13.490 --> 01:14.908
Now you're in for it.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.703
Actually, you're not the only one
who's going to be having fun tonight.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.663
Wait until you see what I have planned.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.875
I found it in my basement.

01:23.958 --> 01:25.585
It might know something we don't.

01:26.169 --> 01:29.422
You don't really believe
these things work, do you?

01:29.506 --> 01:31.466
Let's try it out.

01:34.803 --> 01:38.640
We wisters need your help.
Is anyone out there?

01:42.310 --> 01:43.144
What?

01:44.020 --> 01:45.271
Did you do that?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.607
You did it! I didn't do anything!

01:47.690 --> 01:49.442
Park! Park! Park!

01:49.526 --> 01:51.194
That's crazy loud!

01:51.986 --> 01:54.781
-He'll tire himself out.
-I wish I had a little brother.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.575
No, you don't.
Little brothers are annoying.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.327
Sawyer, stop!

02:00.120 --> 02:00.954
We're busy.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.080
Can I play?

02:02.163 --> 02:03.581
This isn't for little kids.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.669
Go play with your trucks,
and stop being so annoying.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.340
I don't know if I want to do this…

02:12.423 --> 02:14.300
Park! Park! Park!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.636
Park! Park! Park!

02:25.812 --> 02:27.438
[girls chatter in background

02:44.956 --> 02:51.254
"When witches hide
Drink this po-she-an… open mind"

02:56.175 --> 02:58.553
-Lucy!

02:59.929 --> 03:02.056
Did you guys hear that? Sawyer!

03:02.140 --> 03:03.308
You better not be--

03:03.808 --> 03:05.226
Getting up to no good.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.061
Definitely no good.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.780
Look at me, look at me! I'm a cat!

03:58.863 --> 04:00.823
-Sawyer?

04:09.040 --> 04:12.126
Oh no! Sawyer drank all the hiding potion!

04:13.962 --> 04:18.174
Sawyer? Buddy? Here, kitty kitty!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.759
I think he went that way!

04:22.929 --> 04:24.931
You better call the cute police!

04:25.014 --> 04:28.726
Okay, Sawyer.
It was fun while it lasted, but…

04:28.810 --> 04:34.023
we're gonna need you to turn back now and
never ever tell Mom and Dad about this.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.566
No way!

04:35.650 --> 04:37.652
Look how high I can jump!

04:37.735 --> 04:38.653
Sawyer, no!

04:38.736 --> 04:41.072
It's gonna be fun
watching you get grounded.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.824
-For life.

04:43.908 --> 04:47.078
Not me though.
Kittens can't get in trouble.

04:47.161 --> 04:50.873
Sawyer! Come down here.
On the count of three.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.417
-One…

04:52.500 --> 04:54.127
-Two…

04:54.210 --> 04:57.672
-Three?
-Oh, now you want to pay attention to me?

04:57.755 --> 04:58.673
What do we do?

05:00.967 --> 05:01.801
Uh…

05:01.884 --> 05:05.680
When Sawyer's hiding is said and done
Return the form that he came from

05:06.889 --> 05:09.726
Look at my hands. They're paws now!

05:09.809 --> 05:13.646
I said, return the form that he came from!

05:13.730 --> 05:16.024
Can't catch me! Nana nana boo boo!

05:16.107 --> 05:17.942
-Why isn't this working?!
-Park! Park!

05:18.026 --> 05:20.403
-We've got to stop him!
-Oopsie-daisy!

05:20.486 --> 05:23.114
-He's making such a mess!
-Park! Park! Park!

05:23.197 --> 05:25.742
-I hate having a little brother!

05:27.201 --> 05:28.494
I'm out of here!

05:28.578 --> 05:30.747
-No, Sawyer! Not outside!
-Park! Park!

05:30.830 --> 05:33.082
See you never!

05:33.666 --> 05:36.961
You stop right now or you're
gonna be grounded for the rest of your….

05:37.712 --> 05:38.546
Sawyer?

05:39.881 --> 05:42.133
Please tell me you guys see him.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.969
-I'm just not sure…
-Hey!

05:45.053 --> 05:47.472
A ride to the park? Don't mind if I do!

05:48.473 --> 05:50.600
Where did he go, where did he go?!

05:50.683 --> 05:54.896
I turned my brother into a cat,
and then I lost him!

05:54.979 --> 05:57.440
My parents are gonna…

05:57.523 --> 05:59.233
Ground you for the rest of your life?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.027
Yeah.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.072
Hello?

06:04.655 --> 06:05.865
Anybody home?

06:07.283 --> 06:10.161
The door just opened, so I walked in!

06:10.244 --> 06:13.581
I-I-I've got a, I got a pizza pie here.

06:13.664 --> 06:19.170
One, uh anchovy and pineapple,
and one with liver and…

06:20.379 --> 06:24.050
Well, we didn't have
any cockroaches, so…

06:24.133 --> 06:25.551
Just liver!

06:27.053 --> 06:28.721
-If you only knew…

06:28.805 --> 06:33.434
…how hard it was to get
cockroach on your pizza around here.

06:37.855 --> 06:42.735
Well, uh, that'll be
48 dollars and 15 cents.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.908
I think I've forgotten my wallet.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.577
How about this instead?

06:53.538 --> 06:56.040
Oh no!

06:57.166 --> 06:59.794
What's that smell?

07:01.629 --> 07:04.882
Oops. What have I done?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.886
Oh! Did you just turn me into a topping?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.972
Well, have a good night.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.226
And when we ask for cockroaches,
bring cockroaches.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.729
Or next time I'm ordering bacon!

07:18.813 --> 07:20.314
Okay.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.776
So, can you turn me back now?

07:24.694 --> 07:25.528
Oh man.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.573
I knew I should have taken
the fish and chips gig.

07:29.157 --> 07:32.285
Let's get him fed
and off on his mission!

07:32.368 --> 07:34.495
Eat up! You'll need
all the energy you can get.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.664
Those three can be quite a handful.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.959
This is weird pizza,
but I will eat anything.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.628
Uh, why is there a pig in the hallway?

07:42.712 --> 07:45.131
You know what? I-I-I don't want to know.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.885
No mold on the crust? Does nobody know
how to make a good pie anymore?

07:48.968 --> 07:52.597
Okay, too slow! Let's go, come on!
Enough loafing around. Take this.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.559
Bringing in the warlock?
Is this really necessary?

07:56.642 --> 07:57.685
We got this!

07:57.768 --> 08:00.313
We must be getting desperate.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.856
Is the plan clear?

08:01.939 --> 08:08.279
Steal something those girls need,
and we'll trade it for the necklace.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.198
I got it.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.951
Good. No! You'll get pizza
when you bring us the necklace.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.247
-Good luck!
-Go with him, Claw.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.125
He better come back with that amulet.

08:21.209 --> 08:23.419
Aw, cheese! Cheese, cheese, cheese!

08:23.503 --> 08:26.464
Oh! Oh, I love cheese.
Don't judge me.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.508
Don't touch the pizza.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.884
Put it down.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.725
-What are we gonna do?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.686
I am most definitely grounded
for the rest of middle school,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.438
probably high school, and college!

08:42.522 --> 08:43.356
Hm…

08:43.439 --> 08:47.276
Even for my whole career.
And maybe even when I'm a grandma.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.071
Calm down, Lucy.
Why don't we call your parents?

08:50.154 --> 08:55.117
And say what? "Sorry, I lost your
favorite kid. Oh! And he's a kitten now!"

08:55.201 --> 08:56.035
Aha!

08:56.619 --> 08:59.372
Looks like the kid brother
got into the hiding potion.

08:59.455 --> 09:02.750
We have to go after him.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.711
He's so tiny! He could be anywhere.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.131
We need a bird's-eye view or something.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
Yes! Or a broom's-eye view!

09:13.010 --> 09:14.679
-Come on!

09:14.762 --> 09:16.305
Hide, hide, hide!

09:21.018 --> 09:23.271
Sawyer! Where are you, buddy?

09:24.105 --> 09:26.148
Bingo, done and done.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.859
I know exactly
what we can trade for the amulet.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.487
-Now I just have to find that kitten.

09:31.571 --> 09:32.572
-Mm!
-Mm!

09:32.655 --> 09:35.408
Great work! Go, go, go!

09:35.491 --> 09:37.743
Claw, you go east, and I'll go west.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.621
-Find that kitten, and fast.
-Sure! Happy hunting!

09:43.332 --> 09:45.293
I hope One-Whisker Pete works late.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.169
And he's got my broom ready.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.259
We're coming for you, Sawyer.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.060
Three,
three sardine cakes, please?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.312
No, no, just…

10:04.395 --> 10:07.481
No, just for me, please.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.484
Hello? One-Whisker Pete!

10:11.068 --> 10:13.821
Huh? What? Who?
Who, where, when, where? Who, what, where?

10:14.822 --> 10:17.241
Willa? Lucy? Scout?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.577
What are you doing out so late?

10:19.660 --> 10:23.039
Oh, thank goodness. We were
worried you might be closed already.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.876
A magic shop shopkeeper is never off duty!

10:26.959 --> 10:30.963
Although I was in the middle
of a catnap.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.050
Well, wake up!
We have a magical emergency.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.468
We need your help, Pete.

10:37.553 --> 10:41.432
When our hiding's said and done
Return the forms that we came from

10:42.516 --> 10:44.060
Alright, alright, alright.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.478
What's the emergency?

10:45.561 --> 10:50.024
So, my brother drank a lot of our
not-so-secret-anymore hiding potion,

10:50.775 --> 10:55.154
and now we got a kitten on the loose and
we can't seem to turn him back into a boy.

10:55.237 --> 10:58.240
Oh my, that is… a problem.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.534
Is there a spell we can use
to change him back?

11:00.618 --> 11:03.162
Some kind of un-hiding potion?

11:03.245 --> 11:06.540
A curse reversed can't be coerced.
The worst!

11:06.624 --> 11:11.337
Uh… English, please? We don't start
Shakespeare until the eighth grade.

11:11.420 --> 11:14.215
If he drank too much potion,

11:14.298 --> 11:17.176
he needs to change himself back.

11:18.386 --> 11:22.181
Just have him say the reversal spell
into a mirror. Is that possible?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.142
Not likely.
That means he would have to sit still,

11:25.226 --> 11:27.728
and you'd have better luck
with a bobblehead

11:27.812 --> 11:30.356
in a bouncy house, during an earthquake.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.315
Yep.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.733
Totally.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.694
Let's find him and
figure that part out next.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.613
Could we borrow my broom?

11:37.696 --> 11:39.782
Now Willa, I must warn you.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.827
Last time you had
your mother's magic guiding the broom.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.497
Are you ready this time to fly solo?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.623
Yeah.

11:48.624 --> 11:49.625
Very well.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.180
Good luck out there. Remember,
broom flying is much harder at night.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.724
Harder to avoid bugs, you know?

12:05.808 --> 12:09.437
Be careful they don't end up
clogging your winker-blinkers.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.023
Did he just say winker-blinkers?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.984
I think so.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.195
You know, I mean, your eyes. Your eyes!

12:22.908 --> 12:25.494
Well? Get on!

12:25.578 --> 12:26.537
All of us?

12:26.620 --> 12:27.830
All of you?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.623
You want to find Sawyer or not?

12:31.375 --> 12:33.919
Wait, wait, wait!
That's a mono-broom. One rider only.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.338
Three riders could make it
unstably dangerous.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.718
Look, if all three of you
insist on riding,

12:40.801 --> 12:44.597
just make sure you land nice and slow,
will you please?

12:44.680 --> 12:47.558
The extra weight
could flip you head over heels!

12:47.641 --> 12:49.351
Thank you, Pete!

12:49.435 --> 12:51.604
Are you even listening to me?

12:51.687 --> 12:55.232
-I hope you find your brother!

12:58.652 --> 13:03.282
I love these yellow chunks of pineapple.
They're so sickly-sweet.

13:03.866 --> 13:04.950
Like malaria.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.037
Ugh. I mean, what is it?
Is it an apple? Is it a pine cone?

13:08.120 --> 13:10.247
It doesn't even know what it is.
Disgusting.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.417
It announces itself
with a flourish on the tongue.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.835
Who ordered this thing?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.086
Me!

13:16.170 --> 13:19.798
There's two kinds of witches:
ones who like pineapple, ones who do-- Oh!

13:19.882 --> 13:20.758
-Whoo!
-Hello!

13:20.841 --> 13:24.220
I've spotted the kitten
with my eagle eye. I mean…

13:24.303 --> 13:25.930
My crow eye.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.307
Over here, warlock boy!

13:28.390 --> 13:31.602
-I'm closing in on the little brother.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.271
Do you think she…

13:35.022 --> 13:37.233
It's the park! Time to play.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.319
I just wish I had someone to play with.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.365
He's on his own. I'm going in.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.283
Here, kitty kitty.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.161
Someone to play with!

13:52.039 --> 13:53.916
Anyone see him anywhere?

13:54.542 --> 13:57.169
-Lucy, what's Sawyer's favorite place?

13:57.253 --> 14:02.508
Well, he likes ice cream,
toy cars, dinosaurs, and the park.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.511
Ice cream's closed for winter,
his toy trucks are at home,

14:05.594 --> 14:08.556
and dinosaurs are extinct.
Let's check out the park.

14:08.639 --> 14:13.185
'K. I might not have mentioned…
I've only landed once.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.228
Once?!

14:14.895 --> 14:17.481
Hang on! We're coming in for a landing.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.150
I love to play! Let's play.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.777
Okay. Make me go up!

14:21.860 --> 14:23.571
Sure, kid. Hang on.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.366
Whee! Okay, now down.

14:27.449 --> 14:31.120
Sure. We're in the park,
so let's have some fun.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.372
You're way more fun than my sister!

14:39.503 --> 14:41.130
-Everyone okay?

14:41.630 --> 14:42.923
Lucy?

14:44.133 --> 14:45.426
Sawyer?

14:45.509 --> 14:46.802
Who's that?

14:47.469 --> 14:48.679
Get away from my brother!

14:48.762 --> 14:51.807
No! You can't tell me who to play with!

14:51.891 --> 14:56.562
That cloak is so 1400s.
Lose the hood, warlock guy.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.024
Come on, Sawyer.
Let's play hide and seek. Come find me.

15:00.107 --> 15:02.776
I love hide and seek.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.029
You stop right now!

15:06.071 --> 15:07.907
Ready or not, here I come!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.909
Sawyer! Come back!

15:09.992 --> 15:13.078
Oh, now you want to play? Too late!

15:13.162 --> 15:14.079
Take that!

15:15.998 --> 15:17.166
Whoa!

15:17.666 --> 15:19.668
Over here, Sawyer! Come find me!

15:19.752 --> 15:21.086
Now where is he?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.631
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.840
Sawyer, get back here!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.842
-I think he went this way…
-Ha!

15:29.720 --> 15:30.721
Sawyer!

15:33.390 --> 15:34.475
Ha! Found you!

15:37.186 --> 15:39.313
Hey… What's going on?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.400
Help me! Guys, I'm sinking!

15:43.484 --> 15:46.654
This isn't fun anymore!
I don't like this game!

15:47.404 --> 15:49.323
Please! Help her.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.993
What did you do?
I thought we were friends.

15:53.077 --> 15:56.997
-Stop! Put me down right now!

15:57.081 --> 16:00.125
Lucy! Help! Help me! Save me!

16:00.209 --> 16:02.878
Willa! Scout! Help me!

16:02.962 --> 16:06.090
-We're coming!

16:06.173 --> 16:08.050
-Help!

16:11.220 --> 16:12.638
Stop! Please!

16:12.721 --> 16:13.973
What do you want?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.724
I thought you'd never ask.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.436
I'll trade you one kitten brother
for one magical amulet.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.438
Lucy, help! Help! Help me!

16:21.522 --> 16:23.232
Sure. Here.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.067
Anything, just give him back!

16:25.150 --> 16:26.527
Get him! Save me!

16:30.698 --> 16:31.782
Get off me!

16:32.366 --> 16:34.743
You're tougher than you look.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.121
That's right! That's my sister!

16:37.204 --> 16:39.540
No, no, no.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.294
-Oh, no, no, no! Not this high!

16:46.338 --> 16:48.757
I'll-I'll drop him!
I'm not kidding around!

16:50.050 --> 16:51.510
Now, turn over the amulet!

16:51.593 --> 16:55.264
Lucy? Do I have nine lives? For real?

16:55.347 --> 16:57.349
Give me back my brother!

16:57.433 --> 16:59.643
-Stop it! Are you kidding me?

16:59.727 --> 17:00.894
-Stop!

17:00.978 --> 17:01.937
No!

17:02.021 --> 17:03.897
Whoa, whoa… No!

17:03.981 --> 17:04.982
No!

17:11.280 --> 17:12.322
Stand back!

17:12.406 --> 17:13.949
You're going down, kitty-napper!

17:14.033 --> 17:17.578
This isn't the last you've seen of me,
or Wanda or Wilma.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.831
If they want something, they will get it.

17:20.914 --> 17:22.750
Yeah? Well, if I were you, I'd--

17:24.710 --> 17:27.421
Um, manners much?!

17:28.714 --> 17:31.300
He wanted to trade me
Sawyer for my amulet.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.968
You were going to do that?

17:33.052 --> 17:35.596
Of course! He's your brother.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.806
But I went all wild woman
and scared him off.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.932
Yeah.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.268
-She-Hulk.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.186
Thanks, Willa.

17:43.937 --> 17:47.149
Don't ever do anything like that again.
I was so worried.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.651
If anything happened to you,
I'd be so upset!

17:50.235 --> 17:52.071
I'm sorry, Lucy.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.365
Me too, buddy.
Now, let's get you home.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.535
-Come on.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.416
Boy, that amulet was so close
I could taste it.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.128
They're like the pineapple
to your pizza of life:

18:08.212 --> 18:13.008
disgusting, numerous,
and you just want to get rid of them!

18:15.094 --> 18:16.303
Yeah, sure.

18:17.304 --> 18:21.266
Forget the amulet.
Forget about turning all good witches bad.

18:21.767 --> 18:26.105
How about a group vacation? Huh? Just us!

18:26.688 --> 18:28.941
Who was that warlock guy?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.027
Who knew we had three people after us?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.154
He could have really hurt my brother.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.616
I've had enough of
those mean witches pushing us around.

18:37.699 --> 18:40.619
And now they're sending
other people to do their dirty work, too?

18:42.412 --> 18:44.832
-What are we gonna do?

18:48.252 --> 18:49.419
My parents!

18:49.503 --> 18:53.006
This place is a disaster and
we've gotta change Sawyer back.

18:53.090 --> 18:56.760
Why don't we just all turn into cats
and go hide at that park?

18:56.844 --> 18:58.220
I thought we nailed that one.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.264
-Um…
-Here we go!

19:00.889 --> 19:03.684
Tidy up in a flash
Neat and clean is a bash

19:05.477 --> 19:07.146
Whoa!

19:07.229 --> 19:11.942
You have to teach me how to do that.
I hate cleaning my room.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.360
Come on, I never bring keys.

19:14.236 --> 19:15.737
Okay, Sawyer. Your turn.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.159
Only if I get to play
with you guys all the time.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.286
-Fine!
-And…

19:22.369 --> 19:25.998
you have to take me to the park
whenever you babysit.

19:26.081 --> 19:28.208
Fine. Just say the words and look in here.

19:28.292 --> 19:32.421
And push me on the swings
for 20 whole minutes.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.339
Crisis averted.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.382
Fine!

19:35.465 --> 19:36.550
Okay.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.219
-When my hiding's said and done…
-Hurry, hurry!

19:39.303 --> 19:41.597
Return the form that I came from

19:41.680 --> 19:43.473
-This better work.

19:43.557 --> 19:46.727
-You were meant to leave hours ago!
-Lucy! We're home!

19:47.311 --> 19:50.522
Sorry we're late.
You know how your dad is with charades.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.404
Boring night, huh?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.489
Totally boring.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.116
Lots of time to clean.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.286
-See? He is an angel.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.413
You owe me
ice cream for a month.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.626
Okay! Time for jammies! Let's do that.

20:17.007 --> 20:20.719
Remind me to cancel
my babysitting course.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.181
Willa has the amulet.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.851
It's a little early,
but we'll make the best of it.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.853
Isn't it time to bring her here yet?

20:29.937 --> 20:32.898
Every witch must have her own path.

20:33.398 --> 20:37.611
And with her mother's help,
I think we'll see her here soon enough.

20:38.862 --> 20:40.447
What do we do now, Mom?

20:40.948 --> 20:45.285
Those bad witches also have
a warlock working with them.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.830
I wish you could send me a sign.
Who can help us?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.419
-Whoa.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.298
Everything okay?

21:01.510 --> 21:02.344
Dad?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.266
That's my name!

21:07.891 --> 21:09.393
Just wanted to say good night.

21:10.310 --> 21:15.232
I love you kiddo, and whatever you need,
whenever you need me, I'll be there.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.779
Dad, what would you do

21:20.862 --> 21:25.409
if someone was trying to take
something away from you that was yours?

21:25.492 --> 21:28.537
Well, there's only one thing to do.

21:29.955 --> 21:30.956
Fight back!

21:34.668 --> 21:36.670
That's just the help I needed.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.463
Well, good.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.383
Alright, here we go.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.428
-Lights on or off?
-On.

21:44.511 --> 21:48.015
Okay, you've got her! Good night, Willa!

21:48.515 --> 21:49.725
Night.

21:54.104 --> 21:59.943
Wow. Returning to us empty-handed after
we had everything all lined up, and now…

22:00.027 --> 22:02.195
The cat is literally out of your bag.

22:02.279 --> 22:08.285
You are a disgrace
to dark magic makers everywhere.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.037
I mean, evil…

22:10.120 --> 22:14.458
Evil's a choice, and perhaps
it's just one you're unwilling to make.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.544
Just one little necklace,
from one little girl.

22:17.627 --> 22:21.465
In exchange for untold power.

22:25.427 --> 22:28.263
-Give me one more chance.
