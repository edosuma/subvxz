WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:06.673
You will be performing stand-up
in front of a live audience.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.375
I bet they get so white,
they say,

00:08.475 --> 00:10.377
"Can I speak to the manager,
please?"

00:11.411 --> 00:12.512
Anyway--
wait, what were we--

00:12.612 --> 00:13.780
what were we talking about
again?

00:13.880 --> 00:15.181
Well...

00:16.616 --> 00:19.085
I'm feeling a little bad
for them at this point.

00:19.185 --> 00:20.687
Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.756
I'm finally a B cup.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.424
Just wasn't funny enough.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.892
Sasha and Anetra.

00:25.992 --> 00:29.195
I wanted more confidence,
which is weird.

00:29.295 --> 00:31.131
You're Sasha Colby, girl.
I want more from you.

00:32.132 --> 00:33.299
Loosey and Luxx.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.868
You were so funny.

00:34.968 --> 00:37.103
You are both the winners
of this week's challenge.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.905
[both scream]

00:39.005 --> 00:41.574
Anetra, shantay, you stay.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.910
Marcia, sashay away.

00:48.114 --> 00:51.017
[dramatic music]

00:51.117 --> 00:54.387
[music continues]

00:54.487 --> 00:56.322
Ay-yi-yi.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.991
We are back in the Werkroom,

00:58.091 --> 01:00.393
and Marcia, Marcia, Marcia's
going home, home, home.

01:00.493 --> 01:03.797
She should have been home
a long time ago, to be honest.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.732
Instead of me being in the
bottom some of those times,

01:05.832 --> 01:07.067
it definitely
could have been Marcia.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.836
So sorry, girl.
I love you.

01:09.936 --> 01:13.440
"You know what they say.
There's no place like home."

01:13.540 --> 01:15.675
- Aw, Marshal.
- So sweet.

01:15.775 --> 01:17.243
I'm trying to be, like, sad,
because she was--

01:17.343 --> 01:18.278
I'm a bitch.
You're gonna twirl down.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.546
You gotta murder her.

01:19.646 --> 01:20.847
When you leaped
over her, bitch...

01:20.947 --> 01:23.950
Oh, I lost it.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.519
- We love you, Marcia.
- Bye, Marshal.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.488
I hope the girls got
the boss bitch memo,

01:28.588 --> 01:30.857
because I'm not playing
with these hos anymore.

01:30.957 --> 01:33.293
I'm ready to promote myself
and get another win.

01:35.395 --> 01:38.031
Well, I guess congratulations
to Luxx and Loosey--

01:38.131 --> 01:39.232
Not "I guess."

01:39.332 --> 01:40.467
- [laughter]
- "I guess."

01:40.567 --> 01:41.901
That's crazy, bitch.
Y'all both won.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.369
I know.
I was gagged.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.938
- We both have...
- Two.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.906
- Two Maxi Challenge wins.
- Two Maxi Challenge wins.

01:47.006 --> 01:48.274
Ooh!

01:49.442 --> 01:51.344
I have no wins
in this competition.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.213
The double win should have been
mine and Mistress's,

01:53.313 --> 01:54.514
point blank, period.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.350
Selena, well, you did,
like, super, super well.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.651
Thank you.

01:58.751 --> 01:59.953
So, like,
are you feeling better

02:00.053 --> 02:01.087
than you were
in the last couple of weeks?

02:01.187 --> 02:02.489
I feel good.

02:02.589 --> 02:04.958
And, like, there's hope
now a little bit.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.292
There's a little bit of hope.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.927
I just need to make it
to the next week.

02:08.027 --> 02:09.462
I don't feel like I need
to have wins under my belt

02:09.562 --> 02:10.530
in order to win.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.931
Listen, if I'm in the top,

02:12.031 --> 02:14.701
I can talk my way
into winning the crown.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.236
Listen, everybody,
I don't know about y'all,

02:16.336 --> 02:17.971
but I am entering my top era.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.772
I'm ready.
It's hard.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.074
- Oh!
- Whoo-hoo.

02:21.174 --> 02:24.477
I am entering my angel era,
my angelic era.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.312
Fallen. [laughs]

02:26.412 --> 02:28.047
Fallen angel.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.750
I'm gonna enter
my rotten bitch era.

02:30.850 --> 02:32.986
We love to see it.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.420
Authenticity.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.189
I'm just kidding.
I'm entering my winning era.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.657
Go on.

02:37.757 --> 02:39.292
All right, well, I'm
in my de-dragging era now.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.227
- Yes, it is time.
- Let's do it.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.796
If you stay in an era,
you ain't got to get in an era.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.298
Can I get an amen up in here?

02:46.933 --> 02:49.936
This is the closest I've
gotten to being on the bottom,

02:50.036 --> 02:51.738
and it doesn't feel right.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.673
Welcome to the club.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.408
There's definitely
this feeling

02:55.508 --> 02:57.944
of "don't get too comfortable."

02:58.044 --> 03:00.680
I'm sorry,
but she looks so crazy.

03:01.781 --> 03:04.417
It's giving
Joey Jay on Halloween.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.219
I'm a ghoul-ass bitch.
She's Joey Jay.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.588
I'm a ghoul-ass bitch.
I'm Joey Jay.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.524
I think that Sasha
placing low this week

03:11.624 --> 03:13.259
really does show
that it doesn't matter

03:13.359 --> 03:15.461
who you think is
huge competition.

03:15.562 --> 03:18.598
Anyone can fall at any moment.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.667
To ensure my spot
in the finale,

03:20.767 --> 03:24.904
I am just going to keep
giving them the Luxx fantasy.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.873
It got me here.
It can get me to the end.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.742
[dramatic music]

03:30.610 --> 03:31.811
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

03:31.911 --> 03:33.346
The winner
of "RuPaul's Drag Race"

03:33.446 --> 03:34.781
receives a one-year supply

03:34.881 --> 03:36.883
of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics

03:36.983 --> 03:40.987
and a gag-worthy grand prize
of $200,000,

03:41.087 --> 03:42.488
served by Cash App,

03:42.589 --> 03:45.692
with extra-special guest judge
Orville Peck.

03:45.792 --> 03:46.960
[singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

03:47.060 --> 03:48.294
May the best
drag queen win

03:48.394 --> 03:50.363
Best drag queen win

03:52.065 --> 03:53.900
[dance music]

03:54.000 --> 03:55.802
- [falsetto note]
- [falsetto note]

03:55.902 --> 03:56.803
EsTitties.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.304
We are at the final six,

03:58.404 --> 04:01.274
and it is so close
to the finish line.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.010
I can see it,
and I have horrible vision.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.980
So if I can see that we're
almost at the finish line,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.381
bitch, we're there.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.283
The competition is
neck and neck, bitch.

04:10.383 --> 04:12.318
So I'm letting y'all girls
know right now,

04:12.418 --> 04:14.287
it's an end
to my congenial era.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.423
I'm--I'm entering
my chaotic era.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.626
Oh, no, it wasn't
chaotic before?

04:19.726 --> 04:22.028
[yelling] - [screaming]

04:22.128 --> 04:25.598
Bitch, Mistress has more eras
than Cher or Madonna, girl.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.034
No, what I would like to see
is her skinny era bitch.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.737
Let's see with that. [laughs]

04:30.837 --> 04:31.871
[siren wails]

04:31.971 --> 04:33.873
- Ooh!
- Ooh, girl!

04:33.973 --> 04:36.242
She done already done
had herses.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.244
Yes.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.813
America's
next drag superstar

04:40.913 --> 04:43.149
needs to bring home the bacon

04:43.249 --> 04:46.252
and put her best foot forward,

04:46.352 --> 04:49.522
or I'm gonna have
to cut you loose.

04:50.523 --> 04:51.724
- "Footloose"?
- Bacon?

04:51.824 --> 04:53.693
We're gonna do
"Let Loose," but as a musical?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.395
Oh, my God.
[laughter]

04:55.495 --> 04:56.963
Hello, hello, hello.

04:57.063 --> 04:58.197
[all cheer]

04:58.298 --> 05:01.200
Ladies, ladies,
ladies, ladies.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.236
You know, in a world
where people

05:03.336 --> 05:07.106
focus on our differences,
never underestimate

05:07.206 --> 05:11.444
the power of song and dance
to bring us together.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.446
So for this week's
Maxi Challenge,

05:13.546 --> 05:17.250
you'll be starring in the
all-dancing, all-prancing

05:17.350 --> 05:19.419
Rusical, "Wigloose."

05:19.519 --> 05:21.020
[singing] Wigloose

05:21.120 --> 05:23.222
[all cheering]

05:23.323 --> 05:28.161
Set in the '80s, "Wigloose"
takes place in a small town

05:28.261 --> 05:31.898
where drag has been outlawed.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.066
Imagine that.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.436
The characters
include Heaven Bacon,

05:36.536 --> 05:38.905
a teenage drag queen

05:39.005 --> 05:40.773
ready to shake things up;

05:40.873 --> 05:44.777
Mama Bacon, Heaven Bacon's
wise drag mother;

05:44.877 --> 05:48.247
Preacher Teacher,
the narrow-minded town leader;

05:48.348 --> 05:49.916
and there's Carl...

05:50.016 --> 05:51.217
Carl?

05:51.317 --> 05:54.420
Preacher Teacher's
obedient husband.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.090
Now I'll let you decide
who plays which part.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.992
And to help you put
the wig in "Wigloose,"

06:00.093 --> 06:04.464
we are providing
big '80s hair by Wigs & Grace.

06:04.564 --> 06:05.698
all: Ooh.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.101
Racers, start your engines,

06:08.201 --> 06:11.104
and may
the best drag queen win.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.972
Rusical, ladies.

06:13.072 --> 06:14.674
It's time for us
to pick our roles.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.142
I smell a gate coming on.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.276
Oh, not a gate.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.945
Everyone here
except for me

06:19.045 --> 06:20.680
has
musical theater experience,

06:20.780 --> 06:23.015
so I'm at a little bit
of a disadvantage.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.119
But, baby, I'm about to flip it
and show you how it's done.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.620
I live.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.288
Miss Fierce!

06:29.389 --> 06:32.592
I'm listening, and the first
character is Preacher Teacher.

06:32.692 --> 06:33.993
Bitch, I am feeling her.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.329
The villain,
the bitch of the scene--

06:36.429 --> 06:38.297
I'm going to be
Preacher Teacher.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.166
The way
Heaven Bacon's eating...

06:40.266 --> 06:41.467
[laughter]

06:41.567 --> 06:42.702
I really connect

06:42.802 --> 06:43.803
with the character
of Heaven Bacon.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.205
He is the lead in the show.

06:46.305 --> 06:48.808
I want this role to show
the judges

06:48.908 --> 06:53.079
that I can be really serious
and that I am a star.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.180
Very cute.

06:54.280 --> 06:55.281
What are you all feeling?

06:55.381 --> 06:56.482
I wanna be Preacher Teacher.

06:56.582 --> 06:57.717
I think I would
fucking kill that role,

06:57.817 --> 06:59.018
and that sets up everyone else.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.253
What are you feeling, Anetra?

07:00.353 --> 07:02.288
- Mama Bacon or Preacher.
- Okay.

07:02.388 --> 07:03.956
You would be sickening
as Mama

07:04.056 --> 07:06.159
'cause I'm gonna be Preacher.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.162
I think doing Mama
is actually gonna work out

07:09.262 --> 07:10.930
better for me,
just because I feel

07:11.030 --> 07:12.131
like it resonates with me.

07:12.231 --> 07:13.633
It feels right on my heart.

07:13.733 --> 07:15.334
Is it cool that I take Carl?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.936
- Yeah.
- Hot.

07:17.036 --> 07:20.573
Carl is a nerdy,
very submissive husband

07:20.673 --> 07:21.741
of the villain.

07:21.841 --> 07:24.110
It's really funny to have me,

07:24.210 --> 07:26.145
like, turn into an old man.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.247
The two roles
that I would wanna do

07:28.347 --> 07:30.416
are Heaven and Christian.

07:30.516 --> 07:32.518
Same, so either or.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.686
I would also--

07:33.786 --> 07:36.556
I'm also very interested
in Heaven.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.291
Christian's voice seems

07:38.391 --> 07:41.060
like your personality,
you know?

07:41.160 --> 07:45.064
So I understand why you
resonate with Christian.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.699
I also resonate with Heaven.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.167
I see myself as Heaven.

07:48.267 --> 07:50.603
The character of Heaven
is someone who I think

07:50.703 --> 07:52.738
I can put a lot of myself into.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.341
So I'll take Christian,
so you guys can fight it out.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.976
Is that cool?
Is that cool with you?

07:57.076 --> 07:58.444
- Sure.
- Okay, so who's

07:58.544 --> 07:59.645
gonna be Heaven?

07:59.745 --> 08:01.113
I'm gonna be Heaven.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.782
I would really like
to be Heaven.

08:02.882 --> 08:07.153
My energy is very much like
this character of Heaven.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.956
I don't--
I don't really see that.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.357
I don't see it for you.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.693
"I want Heaven."
"No, I want Heaven."

08:13.793 --> 08:15.628
Welcome to Heavengate.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.263
If we were reading
the descriptions

08:17.363 --> 08:18.664
of characters
without the names,

08:18.764 --> 08:20.466
a young, queer kid
from the big city.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.602
- I understand.
- I think that's Luxx.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.737
And if I was reading
"the open-minded jock

08:24.837 --> 08:26.339
- who thinks drag is cool"...
- Mistress.

08:26.439 --> 08:27.874
- I would think Loosey.
- Mistress.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.509
I just feel like--
I feel like I have

08:29.609 --> 08:31.143
the energy of Heaven.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.614
Heaven is very, like,
bright-eyed, super positive,

08:34.714 --> 08:37.183
super, like, go-getter.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.619
My eyes locked with Luxx,
and I'm like,

08:39.719 --> 08:41.687
"There goes Loosey lying."

08:41.787 --> 08:43.856
Girl, just say you wanted
the major role

08:43.956 --> 08:45.057
because you wanna be
in the top.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.526
Keeping it 100,
it's the lead.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.461
You want to do the lead.

08:48.561 --> 08:49.629
I wanna do the character

08:49.729 --> 08:50.763
that I think I would do
the best at.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.198
I'm not even cutting up.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.833
I just feel like you're
not being real, Loosey.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.568
You think I'm not
being real right now?

08:55.668 --> 08:57.303
This is the most real
that I can be.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.504
Just be honest,
you want Heaven

08:58.604 --> 08:59.505
because it's the lead role.

08:59.605 --> 09:00.740
It would be a lie to say

09:00.840 --> 09:02.675
that you wouldn't fit
the description of Tuck.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.044
Oh, my God.

09:05.144 --> 09:08.047
This role of Heaven Bacon
is perfect for me.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.716
And I think that Mistress
and Luxx

09:10.816 --> 09:14.220
don't want me to have it
just because I want it.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.155
So what's gonna be
the resolution for all this?

09:16.255 --> 09:17.857
Everyone's saying
they would turn out any role,

09:17.957 --> 09:19.091
so turn out any fucking role.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.092
Someone be Heaven.
Someone be Tuck.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.093
Fine, I'll be Tuck.

09:21.193 --> 09:22.094
Yay, awesome.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.429
Jesus Christ.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.331
You saying
that I'm putting on a facade

09:25.431 --> 09:27.266
is telling me that I am a liar

09:27.366 --> 09:29.101
and that I am not
a genuine person.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.104
I have not done anything
to let anyone here know

09:32.204 --> 09:34.273
that I'm not being genuine
with you.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.641
There has been
a lot of emotion

09:35.741 --> 09:37.343
shown from Loosey today.

09:37.443 --> 09:40.246
Girl, like, whatever.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.548
I wanted to do Heaven
because I wanted to do Heaven.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.417
But I will let you have Heaven.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.719
I personally don't need
to be the lead

09:46.819 --> 09:48.888
because I know I can shine
in anything.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.022
I will do Christian.

09:50.122 --> 09:51.324
You can do Tuck,
if that's okay.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.392
- We'll be a cute duo.
- Perfect.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.196
Fun thing is,
you all get to play friends,

09:57.296 --> 10:00.099
no matter what you are.

10:00.199 --> 10:01.968
These other girls
are underestimating me.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.403
Because I fought
so much for this role,

10:04.503 --> 10:07.406
I have no other option
but to kill it.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.375
[dramatic music]

10:09.475 --> 10:10.676
[singing] It's the mood

10:10.776 --> 10:12.445
It's the attitude

10:12.545 --> 10:14.280
For the Maxi Challenge
this week,

10:14.380 --> 10:17.850
we are going to be the stars
of the Rusical "Wigloose."

10:17.950 --> 10:19.819
This ball is busted...

10:19.919 --> 10:21.621
- The only thing--
- Officially.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.422
Bitch, don't step over my line.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.292
Hey, hoofers.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.294
- Ooh!
- Hi.

10:28.394 --> 10:30.196
- How's it hanging?
- Low.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.198
[laughter]

10:32.298 --> 10:34.367
- All right, Sasha.
- Hey.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.569
Come on, hoop earrings.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.005
This Rusical is near
and dear to your heart

10:39.105 --> 10:40.106
because it's surround--

10:40.206 --> 10:41.641
- it's about dancing.
- Yeah.

10:41.741 --> 10:44.477
It--it hits home, because
I definitely can understand

10:44.577 --> 10:47.947
a closed mindset and how that
can be put on young kids,

10:48.047 --> 10:49.382
especially in churches,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.417
where they were saying,
like, my sin was worse

10:51.517 --> 10:53.419
- than other people's sins.
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.553
'Cause my mom actually
told me,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.288
when I told her I wanted
to be a girl,

10:56.389 --> 10:57.590
and I wanted to transition,

10:57.690 --> 10:58.991
she was just crying
'cause she was like,

10:59.091 --> 11:00.059
"Well, I just know
you're not gonna you know,

11:00.159 --> 11:01.494
be in heaven with us,"

11:01.594 --> 11:04.497
and was so resolute
to, like, let her kid go.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.998
Is your mother still with us?

11:06.098 --> 11:07.433
- She is.
- Ah.

11:07.533 --> 11:08.868
We don't talk.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.203
You know, we talk a lot
around here about--

11:11.303 --> 11:12.705
about what we're talking about.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.675
This Rusical actually deals
with some of these things.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.109
What role did you get?

11:17.209 --> 11:19.478
I picked Carl.

11:20.146 --> 11:21.714
[laughs]

11:21.814 --> 11:23.949
Why did you choose Carl?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.686
You know, I'm actually
really excited

11:26.786 --> 11:29.955
to play something goofy
and unexpected.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.891
And I get to be married
to Mistress, which is...

11:31.991 --> 11:33.492
[laughter]

11:34.927 --> 11:36.328
Imagine those sheets, though.

11:37.296 --> 11:39.331
That ain't mud on your bed.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.535
I'm sorry if I was
a lot over there.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.470
Oh, don't apologize.
You're fine.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.872
I was just bothered
by, like, Mistress and Luxx,

11:46.972 --> 11:51.177
like, I don't know, acting
like I'm not a genuine person.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.713
Coming out of this argument
with Mistress and Luxx,

11:53.813 --> 11:54.747
Loosey's ready to crack.

11:54.847 --> 11:56.015
So, like, you know, I'm like,

11:56.115 --> 11:57.416
"All right, Loosey,
let's get into this."

11:57.516 --> 11:58.751
I don't think
I've done anything

11:58.851 --> 12:01.420
to show anybody that
I'm, like, a liar

12:01.520 --> 12:03.422
or, like, that I fake.

12:03.522 --> 12:04.857
I think what they're--

12:04.957 --> 12:06.492
like, because
they wouldn't be saying

12:06.592 --> 12:08.994
something like that unless
they saw something, right?

12:09.095 --> 12:11.063
I feel like I've been
really genuine.

12:11.163 --> 12:14.767
I think, like, you let
them get to you easily.

12:14.867 --> 12:15.968
Yeah.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.536
And I think that's
what they sense,

12:17.636 --> 12:19.438
and that's what
they feed off of.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.807
I've been saying, like,
Loosey's ready to crack.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.776
That's how I feel,
but--'cause it's like,

12:23.876 --> 12:26.312
why is she so defensive
when they, like, approach you?

12:26.412 --> 12:29.381
Now that I'm thinking
about it, it's like...

12:29.482 --> 12:31.884
When they laugh at me
when I open my mouth to talk,

12:31.984 --> 12:36.255
like, I dealt with that
in high school so much,

12:36.355 --> 12:39.425
because every time
I open my mouth to talk,

12:39.525 --> 12:41.026
people would make fun of me.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.461
You know, people
would make fun

12:42.561 --> 12:45.164
of the way that I sound
and the way that I talk.

12:45.264 --> 12:49.869
And so I didn't allow myself
to be my genuine self.

12:49.969 --> 12:50.936
Sorry.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.005
No, but you just have
to, like,

12:53.105 --> 12:54.607
be okay with yourself.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.208
And I am.
I do let it get to me.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.409
And--

12:57.510 --> 12:58.878
But at least right now,
I love

12:58.978 --> 13:00.613
that you talk about this,
'cause, like, you're

13:00.713 --> 13:02.214
figuring out why, right?

13:03.849 --> 13:05.584
I just need to think
more about myself

13:05.684 --> 13:07.686
in this, you know?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.791
Because I did
a fucking great job last week.

13:11.891 --> 13:16.896
And, to be blunt,
I led Luxx and I to a win.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.766
If they think that trying
to get under my skin

13:20.866 --> 13:22.268
is gonna get rid of me,
then they have

13:22.368 --> 13:24.036
another thing coming,
because I know

13:24.136 --> 13:25.805
that I'm gonna kill it
in this challenge.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.006
And I'm gonna kill it

13:27.106 --> 13:29.308
in every challenge
going forward,

13:29.408 --> 13:30.910
all the way to the finale.

13:31.010 --> 13:31.911
- Thank you.
- You know?

13:32.011 --> 13:35.281
It's hard.

13:35.381 --> 13:36.482
I get it.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.818
Salina, stop
making people cry.

13:40.853 --> 13:43.255
Well, this sounds like it's
gonna be a lot of fun.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.824
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Sasha.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.993
All right, Anetra,
come on over.

13:48.093 --> 13:50.029
Tell me, what role
do you have in the Rusical?

13:50.129 --> 13:51.697
So I have Mama Bacon.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.033
She gives me, like, big
Dominique Jackson energy.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.335
- Ooh, I love her.
- Very grand.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.571
But I think what attracted
to me, like, the most was,

13:58.671 --> 13:59.972
- like, the tenderness of her.
- Yes.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.274
And it says that, you know,
"drag saved my life."

14:02.374 --> 14:03.843
I kind of relate to that.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.177
Did drag save your life?

14:05.277 --> 14:06.846
- Absolutely.
- How?

14:06.946 --> 14:09.181
I was training full-time
as an athlete

14:09.281 --> 14:11.383
doing taekwondo.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.052
And I thought that I was
gonna be an Olympian.

14:13.152 --> 14:15.621
And, like, some things
happened, and I had to retire.

14:15.721 --> 14:19.358
And I was still living as,
like, a closeted everything.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.293
I lost my whole family.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.965
I had no job.
I had nowhere to live.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.066
And I went to DragCon.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.968
And I remember walking in.

14:29.068 --> 14:31.704
And I remember
feeling so normal

14:31.804 --> 14:33.973
and feeling so in place.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.175
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:36.275 --> 14:40.512
I was in baby drag
and just feeling so accepted

14:40.613 --> 14:43.482
and just seeing
how expressive and just true

14:43.582 --> 14:44.750
everybody was.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.119
And you could literally
feel the love there.

14:47.219 --> 14:50.656
After a weekend of all
of that love and excitement,

14:50.756 --> 14:52.024
I didn't feel like going back

14:52.124 --> 14:54.627
to a closeted
and confined space.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.596
So for me, drag
did save my life.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.866
Drag was everything that
I had when I had nothing.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.068
It's funny how everything connects,

15:03.168 --> 15:05.571
'cause you were born
to do drag.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.275
Thank you.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.011
Understand what Mama Bacon
is saying and relate it

15:12.111 --> 15:15.347
to what you just told me
about yourself,

15:15.447 --> 15:17.349
and it will resonate.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.618
And I can't wait to see you
in the Rusical.

15:19.718 --> 15:21.553
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.721
Okay.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.123
The person that created

15:24.223 --> 15:26.258
"RuPaul's Drag Race"
and DragCon

15:26.358 --> 15:27.593
is standing right
in front of me.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.995
And it's just really,
really, really nice

15:30.095 --> 15:32.431
and surreal to, like, have
this conversation with her.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.799
And it's something
I'll never forget

15:33.899 --> 15:35.801
for my entire life.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.736
Bring your Kleenex, girl.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.271
I'm out of my emotional era.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.875
Hi, Salina EsTitties.
So what role did you get?

15:42.975 --> 15:45.577
I have Tuck.
Tuck is kind of the dumb jock.

15:45.678 --> 15:46.979
What does Tuck want?

15:47.079 --> 15:49.949
Tuck wants to be a queen,
but he's this jock.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.050
And I struggle with that.
Like--

15:51.150 --> 15:52.451
Wait, you struggle with what?

15:52.551 --> 15:55.988
Like, I'm this, and I'm this,
but I'm never here.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.490
Or I'm like, a big girl,
but I'm not that big.

15:58.590 --> 16:00.726
And I'm not thin,
but I'm not that thin.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.494
So I'm always,
like, in the middle.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.364
And I never, like,
really know where my peg fits.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.734
Just, first of all,
let's just breathe, please.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.836
Can you please
exhale and breathe?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.938
Because you've whipped up
this thing

16:13.038 --> 16:14.873
that is not really real.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.711
You've made it
to the top six for being you.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.212
- Shine.
- All right.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.348
- Weren't you born to shine?
- I think so.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.316
- No, no, no, don't think so.
- I am born to shine!

16:24.416 --> 16:26.085
Yes.

16:26.185 --> 16:27.720
That feels good, but it's--ooh.
Yes.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.721
It feels good--but--

16:28.821 --> 16:30.322
It feels good.
That's all.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.690
End of story.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.225
Period.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.960
All right, well, go work on--
on Tuck

16:35.060 --> 16:37.029
and shine, shine, shine.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.497
I'm gonna shine with my Tuck.

16:38.597 --> 16:41.467
[laughs] - Thank you.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.869
After talking with Ru,
bitch, I'm ready to go.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.205
Let's go.
She's ready.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.174
[upbeat music]

16:49.274 --> 16:50.809
[music continues]

16:50.909 --> 16:53.078
Baby, it's time to rehearse
the Rusical

16:53.178 --> 16:54.880
with Miguel Zarate, honey.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.883
Yes, professional choreographer
to the stars, darling.

16:57.983 --> 16:59.318
Welcome, ladies.

16:59.418 --> 17:02.054
This Rusical is inspired
by '80s movies.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.791
The things that I'm looking
for: energy, personality.

17:05.891 --> 17:08.660
And if you're not a dancer,
there's no excuse.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.029
You still have to sell it.

17:10.129 --> 17:12.097
The music is really powerful.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.366
So you truly have
to live up to that.

17:14.466 --> 17:16.502
Baby, going into this,
I'm just so excited.

17:16.602 --> 17:17.736
I wanna see how
these other bitches do

17:17.836 --> 17:18.937
with choreography,

17:19.038 --> 17:20.906
because that's
really gonna show

17:21.006 --> 17:22.141
where the cracks lie.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.642
Loosey, we're gonna start
with you.

17:23.742 --> 17:24.943
Cool.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.378
A little secret weapon of mine

17:26.478 --> 17:28.680
is that I pick up choreography
very quickly.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.883
These girls have no idea
that I danced for years.

17:30.983 --> 17:35.487
And I'm really excited to show
them that, baby, she's got it.

17:35.587 --> 17:37.523
The choreography
that you're about to learn,

17:37.623 --> 17:41.360
it's a big, '80s, impactful,
angry type of moment.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.628
So you're gonna come out,

17:42.728 --> 17:46.398
one, strong arms;
two, to reach;

17:46.498 --> 17:51.503
three, step out again; four;
five and six, seven, eight.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.205
Five and six.

17:53.305 --> 17:54.573
Yeah, but you wanna throw it,
like messy.

17:54.673 --> 17:57.309
Messy, uh.
Messy, uh.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.411
And you wanna hit
a little head with it, too?

17:59.511 --> 18:01.180
Like, head, head?

18:01.280 --> 18:04.249
Yes, yes.
Five and six, seven and eight.

18:04.349 --> 18:08.020
The movement just feels
a little rigid and studied.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.522
The moves is not giving '80s.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.990
I'm not getting that at all.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.227
It's giving--it's white.

18:16.128 --> 18:19.031
Anetra, word
on the street is

18:19.131 --> 18:20.566
that you're
a phenomenal dancer.

18:20.666 --> 18:22.367
So how about we freestyle
on the count of eight?

18:22.468 --> 18:25.404
Give it to me.
And one, two, three, pop.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.372
Six, seven, one more.

18:27.473 --> 18:31.510
Yes, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.879
Ow, word, girl?

18:33.979 --> 18:35.948
Even though
your big number's a ballad,

18:36.048 --> 18:39.151
what I'm gonna teach you
right now is a little snippet

18:39.251 --> 18:41.386
of the big finale number.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.688
So here we go.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.223
Right and push.

18:44.323 --> 18:45.457
Left and push.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.426
Okay, so it's step right,
go right?

18:47.526 --> 18:50.596
Step right, go right, but go
from underneath, underneath.

18:50.696 --> 18:55.100
And right,
underneath, and left.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.268
Step or no step?

18:58.103 --> 19:00.439
Anetra looks like she's
performing calculus,

19:00.539 --> 19:03.208
is what it looks like to me.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.543
You're a little in your head.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.346
Trying to just, like,
okay, next, next, next.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.882
I guess there is a difference
between being, like,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.583
vogue ca-ca-la-ca
and then being,

19:11.683 --> 19:14.052
like, a trained dancer.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.120
Luxx.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.489
And one, two, and three, four,

19:17.589 --> 19:20.459
and five, six, seven, eight.

19:20.559 --> 19:21.493
Close?

19:21.593 --> 19:22.694
Close.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.596
The attitude is great,
and you need that.

19:24.696 --> 19:26.298
I'm just gonna get
a little comfy.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.432
Show me.
What's the next reveal?

19:27.533 --> 19:29.268
Take it off!

19:29.368 --> 19:30.369
Oh, got it.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.470
Give it to me again.

19:31.570 --> 19:32.704
Circle, one and two,

19:32.804 --> 19:34.339
three and four, and five.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.641
Hey.

19:35.741 --> 19:37.176
[laughter]

19:37.276 --> 19:39.144
What I'm seeing is
a lot of personality.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.379
It oozes out of you.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.414
And this character
is perfect for you.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.716
- Luxx, I have a question.
- What?

19:44.816 --> 19:47.486
Why is there
a security tag on your coat?

19:47.586 --> 19:48.954
I didn't steal it, I promise.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.689
It was the worker.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.893
Salina.

19:54.993 --> 19:56.161
Hi, Foxy.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.496
She's in her fly girl outfit.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.864
The thing
about EsTitties is,

19:58.964 --> 20:00.999
everyone sees
this like, "Ow, girl."

20:01.099 --> 20:03.402
But I'm musically
theater trained, honey.

20:03.502 --> 20:07.206
I got experience,
training, skill, darling.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.341
Selena, you are playing Tuck.

20:09.441 --> 20:14.446
And you're
a masculine-y, Westerny jock.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.014
Oh, he's Western?

20:16.114 --> 20:17.482
I'm doing country choreography.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.451
So I have these hats for us.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.119
There's a cowboy hat?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.921
Country...

20:23.021 --> 20:25.457
- A one, a two.
- Oh, my God.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.193
One and two, a three, a four,

20:28.293 --> 20:31.763
go five, six, seven, in,
and chicken,

20:31.863 --> 20:35.701
and one and two, and shanay
and step and yank.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.302
Yeah.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.072
I'm tired
of this country shit.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.307
Mistress,
you're gonna start,

20:42.407 --> 20:44.810
and you're gonna come
with some claws on one.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.814
And you're gonna almost,
because it's '80s, one, two.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.849
I'm not going to lie.
I'm a little worried,

20:50.949 --> 20:54.086
because, girl,
I fucking hate choreography.

20:54.186 --> 20:55.621
Don't break that ankle, girl.

20:55.721 --> 20:58.357
She ain't breaking nothing
in them Hillary Clintons.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.826
Just come up one, land two.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.728
- I hope.
- Five, six--[laughs]

21:02.828 --> 21:04.029
Are you gonna do it?

21:04.129 --> 21:05.297
No, bitch.
Let me watch you some more

21:05.397 --> 21:07.599
'cause I'm a slow learner.

21:07.699 --> 21:08.900
Oh, wow.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.069
Mistress starts telling
the choreographer

21:11.169 --> 21:13.171
how she's gonna
learn the choreography.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.539
I don't know how
that's gonna work.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.208
All right, so do
the steps with me.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.776
I'ma go with you
from the very beginning.

21:20.145 --> 21:21.246
- I'm-- I'm watching you.
- Oh, no, no, no.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.148
Yeah.

21:23.248 --> 21:24.516
So give me, like--

21:24.616 --> 21:26.118
I'm pulling a little bit
from Thriller,

21:26.218 --> 21:28.320
a little bit from,
like, the swamp monster.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.321
- Okay.
- Yeah?

21:29.421 --> 21:32.157
So you wanna go one, two.

21:32.257 --> 21:33.425
Yeah?

21:33.525 --> 21:34.826
And I'm just asking
for a little passé.

21:34.926 --> 21:36.395
I'm a fat bitch
in my kitten heels.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.629
I wanna make sure
I don't just jump

21:37.729 --> 21:38.730
- and just fall forward.
- No, brah.

21:38.830 --> 21:39.731
Brah.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.066
He does this slide split.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.200
Stop playing.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.669
I know Mistress is nervous

21:43.769 --> 21:46.638
just because she hears
the voices in her head.

21:46.738 --> 21:49.174
And I'm hearing them
so loud

21:49.274 --> 21:50.976
when she's trying to get
this choreo.

21:51.076 --> 21:53.312
Here we go.
Rawr, two, good.

21:53.412 --> 21:55.180
Left foot--what?

21:55.280 --> 21:56.882
That was a variation.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.750
It looks like you're
counting yourself out

21:58.850 --> 22:00.252
before we've even started.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.888
Mistress seems quite timid
and hesitant

22:02.988 --> 22:04.856
to bring any personality
to it.

22:04.956 --> 22:06.958
And her character is
full of personality.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.493
What are you worried about?

22:08.593 --> 22:10.562
I just, from experience,
know how I am with choreo.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.630
And for me,

22:11.730 --> 22:12.564
- it's a timing thing.
- Yeah.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.832
But I'm on it.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.133
I'm gonna make sure
that regardless, bitch,

22:15.233 --> 22:16.635
- I'm going to be in my room.
- Yes, bitch.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.170
I'ma get you right.
I'ma get you right.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.905
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.073
Shut up, bitches.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.341
[laughter]

22:22.441 --> 22:23.809
I'm not
a musical theater bitch.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.143
But, bitch,
I'm gonna turn it out,

22:25.243 --> 22:28.046
and this is going to be
a happy ending, okay?

22:28.146 --> 22:30.082
[awkward music]

22:30.182 --> 22:31.950
[upbeat music]

22:32.050 --> 22:33.051
Oh!

22:33.151 --> 22:34.786
[singing] I'm just gonna wake up

22:34.886 --> 22:36.555
Today is the day we get
to perform

22:36.655 --> 22:39.991
our Rusical, "Wigloose,"
in front of the judges.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.626
It's opening night, darlings.

22:41.727 --> 22:44.730
Let me get
my Carl cap on, honey.

22:44.830 --> 22:47.799
I am so ready
to unleash the beast today.

22:47.899 --> 22:50.902
And by "beast,"
I mean my dear Carl.

22:52.704 --> 22:56.942
So, honey,
how you feeling, wifey?

22:58.110 --> 22:59.778
- [laughs]
- Oh, baby?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.047
I was like, who the fuck
are you talking to?

23:02.147 --> 23:04.316
Are you excited to play
a villain, a villainess?

23:04.416 --> 23:06.151
You know, it's gonna be
very different for me

23:06.251 --> 23:08.053
because I'm usually
just a sweet person.

23:08.153 --> 23:10.122
Where are you
gonna pull from?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.391
You know, there's this girl
I once competed with.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.360
And she would play
like she wasn't a villain,

23:15.460 --> 23:17.262
and that made her
even more of a villain.

23:17.362 --> 23:19.364
So I'm really, like, drawing
inspiration from that.

23:19.464 --> 23:20.532
What was her name?

23:20.632 --> 23:21.767
Her name was Doosey.

23:21.867 --> 23:23.135
[laughter]

23:23.235 --> 23:24.970
- Doosey.
- Doosey de Duca.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.206
Mistress is playing
the game at this point.

23:28.306 --> 23:31.777
I know for me, I'm playing
this game with my talents.

23:36.214 --> 23:39.651
Literally, Christian's story
is kind of my story.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.687
I'm having a lot of fun
bringing myself into it.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.056
At the core of it,
it's just about loving drag

23:45.157 --> 23:47.893
and, like, bringing drag
into everybody's lives

23:47.993 --> 23:49.494
as much as we can.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.897
This Rusical is
so important to me,

23:51.997 --> 23:53.832
especially with everything,
like, presently going on

23:53.932 --> 23:55.267
in the world.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.436
It feels like we're taking
a giant step back.

23:57.536 --> 23:58.837
So, like, Mistress,
when you're, like,

23:58.937 --> 24:00.705
going out in the town in Texas,

24:00.806 --> 24:02.407
you're still, like, on guard.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.209
- Oh, most definitely.
- Right.

24:04.309 --> 24:05.877
Because, bitch,
Texas don't be playing

24:05.977 --> 24:07.412
with these laws, honey.

24:07.512 --> 24:11.216
And all these protests about
protesting the Drag Storytime.

24:11.316 --> 24:12.717
- Yeah.
- 'Cause at Mary's, what,

24:12.818 --> 24:14.753
it's like all ages.
Like kids come and everything?

24:14.853 --> 24:16.188
Yeah.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.156
Like at my home bar,
we have kids all the time.

24:18.256 --> 24:19.491
It is family friendly.

24:19.591 --> 24:20.926
And of course,
we have restrictions in place.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.661
Like, they can't come to, like,
the Saturday night shows,

24:22.761 --> 24:24.095
- where it gets a little rowdier.
- Yeah.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.931
I think they just have
crazy, like, thoughts

24:26.031 --> 24:27.666
of what drag is.
I don't know.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.902
It's--
it's very scary at times.

24:31.002 --> 24:34.172
The state of the world
that we live in, it's so wild.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.908
Now they wanna outlaw drag.

24:37.008 --> 24:39.244
And they now feel
entitled to hurt you.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.179
It's such a hard place to be

24:41.279 --> 24:42.447
'cause you really wanna be yourself,

24:42.547 --> 24:44.349
and you really wanna celebrate
who you are,

24:44.449 --> 24:46.418
but sometimes,
you have to be forced

24:46.518 --> 24:50.388
to, like, be quiet
for pure safety.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.891
I've done a couple,
and I will say the thing

24:52.991 --> 24:54.926
that you have to deal with
is that there's always

24:55.026 --> 24:56.695
a lot of community backlash.

24:56.795 --> 24:57.863
The whole thing is,

24:57.963 --> 24:59.664
"We don't want our kids
exposed to this

24:59.764 --> 25:01.967
"because drag queens
are gonna be, like,

25:02.067 --> 25:03.368
a bad influence on them."

25:03.468 --> 25:05.904
But then you have
people protesting

25:06.004 --> 25:09.207
at drag queen story hours
and being extremely violent.

25:09.307 --> 25:11.576
But someone dressed
as a princess

25:11.676 --> 25:15.547
telling a story about a mermaid
is offensive to them.

25:16.748 --> 25:19.384
People in the LGBTQ+ community

25:19.484 --> 25:23.455
are constantly being
targeted with hate

25:23.555 --> 25:25.757
to divert from bigger issues.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.393
What they want
everyone to focus on

25:28.493 --> 25:31.062
is "This drag queen's
reading to our kids."

25:31.162 --> 25:33.064
It kind of feels like
we're getting somewhere,

25:33.164 --> 25:34.432
but at the same time,
it's like,

25:34.533 --> 25:36.868
we still shouldn't be having,
like, problems

25:36.968 --> 25:39.971
about drag queens
reading a story to kids.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.840
Exactorini.

25:41.940 --> 25:44.743
I think that queer people
just going out into the world

25:44.843 --> 25:47.812
and showing resilience
and just saying

25:47.913 --> 25:49.047
"We can't be fucked with

25:49.147 --> 25:50.549
the way
that y'all think we can,"

25:50.649 --> 25:54.486
it's like that's going to be
the driving force for change.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.121
Now I'm in my politician era.

25:57.188 --> 25:59.357
The conservatives
always think

25:59.457 --> 26:02.394
that we're trying
to push our agenda on them

26:02.494 --> 26:05.864
when they're the ones
pushing their agendas on us.

26:05.964 --> 26:07.365
- Definitely.
- They're like,

26:07.465 --> 26:08.533
"Oh, we're--you're grooming

26:08.633 --> 26:10.035
our children to be gay,"

26:10.135 --> 26:13.371
when that's your technique.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.674
Like, it's so,
so hypocritical.

26:15.774 --> 26:18.610
How many times have you seen
someone ask a toddler,

26:18.710 --> 26:19.644
like, "Do you have
a girlfriend?"

26:19.744 --> 26:20.979
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:21.079 --> 26:23.448
Or it's like they have
male kids wearing,

26:23.548 --> 26:26.184
like, "Ladies' Man" T-shirts.

26:26.284 --> 26:30.055
I remember my mom gave me
a wallet when I was, like, 12,

26:30.155 --> 26:32.490
and it had pictures
of Hilary Duff in it.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.659
And she was like,
"Isn't she so pretty?

26:34.759 --> 26:36.094
That's your girlfriend, right?"

26:36.194 --> 26:39.598
And I'm like, "Right..."

26:39.698 --> 26:41.199
Girl, no.

26:41.299 --> 26:44.302
Where's Zac Efron, okay?

26:44.402 --> 26:45.437
Boots.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.638
People don't realize, like,

26:46.738 --> 26:48.173
what they're doing
to their own children

26:48.273 --> 26:49.441
by doing that.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.009
They're, like, putting
them in a box already.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.078
Exact.

26:53.178 --> 26:55.880
So what's really interesting
about "Wigloose" is that

26:55.981 --> 26:58.450
for the first 2/3 of the show,

26:58.550 --> 27:00.552
a couple of us
are in boy drag.

27:00.652 --> 27:03.154
I can't wait to see
how this turns out.

27:03.254 --> 27:04.856
Here, you guys
ready to see this?

27:04.956 --> 27:06.958
Oh, god, I don't even know.

27:07.058 --> 27:08.393
Yee-haw.

27:08.493 --> 27:10.228
Oh, wait, no,
why is it giving?

27:10.328 --> 27:12.564
Is it?
I look like Little Richard.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.466
Shut up.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.700
Let me see. [gasps]

27:15.800 --> 27:17.369
You look like
Christina, bitch.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.139
[laughter]

27:23.041 --> 27:24.376
Go, Carl.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.910
The wigetry of it all.

27:27.879 --> 27:30.782
[dramatic music]

27:30.882 --> 27:35.887
[music continues]

27:42.127 --> 27:45.463
[singing] Cover girl, put
the bass in your walk

27:45.563 --> 27:49.300
Head to toe, let
your whole body talk

27:49.401 --> 27:51.169
Whoo-hoo!

27:51.269 --> 27:52.837
Sexy mama.

27:52.937 --> 27:53.972
You working tonight?

27:54.072 --> 27:56.641
I certainly am.

27:56.741 --> 27:59.444
Welcome to the main stage
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

27:59.544 --> 28:03.882
Michelle Visage, is
this almost paradise?

28:03.982 --> 28:06.618
Well, if you're thinking
of that strip joint

28:06.718 --> 28:09.421
off of exit 102
from the Garden State Parkway,

28:09.521 --> 28:11.322
then, yes, yes, it is.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.692
[laughter]

28:13.792 --> 28:17.128
Let's hear it
for the boy, Ross Mathews.

28:17.228 --> 28:19.831
Ross, are you ready
to get footloose?

28:19.931 --> 28:21.733
Well, it's not my foot
that's loose, Ru.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.302
[laughter]

28:25.170 --> 28:27.405
I'm holding out for a hero.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.207
It's Orville Peck.

28:29.307 --> 28:30.275
Howdy.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.910
Well, howdy, Ru.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.445
I wish I could quit you.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.013
Well, what's the hurry?

28:35.113 --> 28:36.147
You just got here.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.718
This week, we challenged
our queens

28:39.818 --> 28:43.188
to kick up their heels
in "Wigloose," the Rusical.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.557
Racers, start your engines,

28:45.657 --> 28:47.792
and may
the best drag queen win.

28:49.661 --> 28:53.665
Tonight's Rusical reminds us
that anything worthwhile

28:53.765 --> 28:55.400
is worth fighting for.

28:55.500 --> 28:59.471
This is the world premiere
of "Wigloose."

28:59.571 --> 29:01.372
Spring, 1984.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.109
My drag mom and I just moved
from the big city

29:04.209 --> 29:07.979
back to her hometown,
West Bum Tuck, USA.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.681
It was my first day at school.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.049
But as my mama said...

29:11.149 --> 29:12.217
School is school.

29:12.317 --> 29:14.052
How different could it be?

29:16.454 --> 29:18.490
[bell ringing]

29:18.590 --> 29:20.158
Attention students.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.928
To serve as a reminder,
and because my solo

29:24.028 --> 29:25.930
in the church musical got cut,

29:26.030 --> 29:28.566
I've got a little song for you.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.668
One, two, three, four.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.904
Beware of the color red

29:33.004 --> 29:37.675
Because that's
the color of Satan

29:37.776 --> 29:39.844
Don't use the color green

29:39.944 --> 29:43.982
That's also
the color of Satan

29:44.082 --> 29:46.785
And steer clear
of cerulean blue

29:46.885 --> 29:50.855
Because it's gorgeous,
I mean pretty, I mean, ew!

29:50.955 --> 29:53.625
The point is
anything different is scary

29:53.725 --> 29:56.661
So it must be wrong

29:56.761 --> 29:59.397
Must be wrong

29:59.497 --> 30:01.666
These bad clouds
keep it going

30:01.766 --> 30:04.803
Life is black and white

30:04.903 --> 30:08.540
There's nothing between
the lines on the outside

30:08.640 --> 30:11.910
You're either
wrong or right

30:12.010 --> 30:15.246
Whoever you are,
keep that on the inside

30:15.346 --> 30:17.649
I don't wanna see

30:17.749 --> 30:22.487
No wigs,
no heels, no personality

30:22.587 --> 30:27.592
Life is black and white

30:28.827 --> 30:31.162
You, dance for me.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.699
If you can't hate yourself,
how in the hell

30:34.799 --> 30:36.701
are you gonna hate
somebody else?

30:38.870 --> 30:43.341
We're all born naked,
and that's disgusting.

30:43.441 --> 30:44.742
So in conclusion...

30:44.843 --> 30:49.814
Life is black and white

30:51.416 --> 30:52.650
[laughter and applause]

30:52.750 --> 30:54.018
Any questions?

30:54.118 --> 30:55.753
Excuse me, Preacher Teacher?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.422
[upbeat '80s instrumentals]

30:57.522 --> 30:59.457
I'm Heaven Bacon,
and I have a question.

30:59.557 --> 31:01.759
When is the drag ball?
[all gasp]

31:01.860 --> 31:04.495
You must be new
to these parts.

31:04.596 --> 31:07.866
Around here,
"drag" is a four-letter word.

31:07.966 --> 31:09.067
[music continues]

31:09.167 --> 31:12.337
Christian, teach
our new student

31:12.437 --> 31:14.739
how we do things around here.

31:14.839 --> 31:15.840
Yes, mother.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.342
Psst!

31:17.442 --> 31:20.111
Meet us at the abandoned barn
after school.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.449
[soft electronic music]

31:24.549 --> 31:25.583
Whoa.

31:25.683 --> 31:27.452
My name's Christian,
he's Tuck,

31:27.552 --> 31:30.255
and this used to be
a notorious drag club,

31:30.355 --> 31:32.023
Pork Chop's Hideaway.

31:32.123 --> 31:34.792
Until that one year
when everyone got pinkeye.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.128
Now we dress up in secret.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.763
If only we could just--

31:38.863 --> 31:41.432
hang on, I feel
a song coming on.

31:41.532 --> 31:42.800
Hit it.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.203
[upbeat electronic music]

31:45.303 --> 31:47.138
[music continues]

31:47.238 --> 31:49.908
[singing] I wanna express myself

31:50.008 --> 31:53.645
I got some magic in me
I wanna show

31:53.745 --> 31:55.113
Yeah!

31:55.213 --> 31:57.348
There's so much more to me

31:57.448 --> 32:00.418
Besides the freaky thing
I do with my throat

32:00.518 --> 32:02.487
[makes reverberating noise]

32:02.587 --> 32:05.123
[singing] I wanna express myself

32:05.223 --> 32:10.228
I got a fantasy
that I wanna live

32:10.962 --> 32:12.931
Learn how to sew a dress

32:13.031 --> 32:15.800
Instead of learning
how to fashion a shiv

32:15.900 --> 32:17.402
What am I going
to do with this?

32:17.502 --> 32:18.836
That could really
hurt someone.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.071
I know.

32:20.171 --> 32:21.873
both: Our lives
need a little less

32:21.973 --> 32:23.141
[squeak]

32:23.241 --> 32:24.809
And a little less
[gagging sound]

32:24.909 --> 32:27.679
And a little more drag

32:27.779 --> 32:30.548
[singing] Your lives need
a little less Ugh!

32:30.648 --> 32:32.884
And a little less
[screaming] oh my God!

32:32.984 --> 32:34.919
[singing]
And a little more drag

32:35.019 --> 32:36.120
[singing] It's the dress

32:36.220 --> 32:37.121
It's the wig

32:37.221 --> 32:38.790
It's the heels walking in

32:38.890 --> 32:39.791
It's the mug

32:39.891 --> 32:41.125
It's the move

32:41.225 --> 32:42.961
It's the attitude

32:43.061 --> 32:46.164
Our lives need
a little less bleh

32:46.264 --> 32:48.266
And a little less
[giggling]

32:48.366 --> 32:50.635
And a little more drag

32:50.735 --> 32:52.904
My mom taught me
you have to stand up

32:53.004 --> 32:54.205
for what you believe in.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.606
There's a council meeting tonight,

32:55.707 --> 32:57.075
and they're planning to outlaw drag

32:57.175 --> 32:58.476
in West Bum Tuck forever.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.545
We got to go.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.448
[singing] Our lives need
a little less bleh

33:03.548 --> 33:05.516
And a little less
[scream]

33:05.616 --> 33:08.219
And a little more drag

33:09.454 --> 33:10.621
Yay!

33:10.722 --> 33:13.624
[tense electronic music]

33:13.725 --> 33:14.926
[music continues]

33:15.026 --> 33:17.528
Are you sure
you wanna do this, dear?

33:17.628 --> 33:20.898
Think back on the days when we
used to have fun doing drag.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.635
Oh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.472
As of 8:00 p.m. tonight,
there will be

33:27.572 --> 33:30.908
no drag in the township
of West Bum Tuck.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.611
All in favor, say aye.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.113
I...
[all gasp]

33:35.213 --> 33:36.314
Object.

33:38.182 --> 33:41.753
Don't wanna fight, but
you got me up against a wall

33:41.853 --> 33:45.289
Here's a verse from the
good book, GuRu, by RuPaul

33:45.390 --> 33:49.127
Everybody's in drag,
whether you like it or not

33:49.227 --> 33:51.896
Even you

33:51.996 --> 33:53.998
[singing] Your dedication
is pointless

33:54.098 --> 33:55.500
I'm not gonna budge

33:55.600 --> 33:57.335
Your words are falling
on deaf ears

33:57.435 --> 33:58.803
- I don't give a--
- Mom!

33:58.903 --> 34:00.505
[singing] And tonight
when I pray

34:00.605 --> 34:04.308
It's your name
I'm bringing up

34:05.343 --> 34:08.579
[singing] Father, son,
house of love

34:08.679 --> 34:13.684
Hey, take back
your lame law

34:15.653 --> 34:17.989
Give, give, give

34:18.089 --> 34:22.827
Give us our drag ball

34:22.927 --> 34:25.430
My dear wife,
this young man makes

34:25.530 --> 34:27.698
a very persuasive argument.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.900
What do you say?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.870
Well, Carl, my loving,
soft-spoken husband,

34:32.970 --> 34:35.406
what do I say?

34:35.506 --> 34:37.875
I say all those in favor

34:37.975 --> 34:40.611
of banning drag forever,
say aye.

34:40.711 --> 34:41.779
council members: Aye.

34:41.879 --> 34:46.517
Then drag is
abolished officially.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.853
Carl, let's go get dinner.
I'm starving.

34:49.720 --> 34:51.522
What are we gonna do?

34:51.622 --> 34:53.424
[music continues]

34:53.524 --> 34:58.463
[singing] Take, take
back your lame law

35:00.164 --> 35:05.169
And give, give us
our drag ball

35:06.737 --> 35:09.640
We deserve
to be who we are

35:09.740 --> 35:13.478
Baby, it's not your call

35:13.578 --> 35:18.583
So give, give, give,
give us our drag ball

35:21.185 --> 35:23.154
Sorry, Heaven.
You tried.

35:23.254 --> 35:25.556
Kids, this ain't over yet.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.592
Here, hand these out.

35:27.692 --> 35:32.697
[singing] Give, give us
our drag ball

35:36.667 --> 35:37.835
Whoo!

35:41.572 --> 35:43.808
Welcome, Bum Tuckers.

35:43.908 --> 35:48.913
Category is drag ball, Eleganza.

35:50.014 --> 35:52.517
First up, you know him
as Heaven Bacon.

35:52.617 --> 35:55.286
Say hello to Cyndi Whopper.

35:55.386 --> 35:58.856
[singing] Cover girl, put
the face in your walk

35:58.956 --> 36:02.059
You know him as
Christian Preacher Teacher.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.263
Say hello to Madonna
Summer Nights!

36:05.363 --> 36:09.233
[singing] Cover girl

36:09.333 --> 36:11.102
You know him as Tuck.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.339
Say hello to Ivana Dance.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.508
With somebody
who loves me.

36:17.608 --> 36:20.711
Cover, cover,
cover, cover girl

36:20.811 --> 36:23.681
Put that face in your walk

36:23.781 --> 36:25.716
- [thunder crashes]
- Stop right now.

36:25.816 --> 36:29.153
This ball is busted officially.

36:29.253 --> 36:34.258
The only thing busted around
here is that mug, Erline.

36:35.059 --> 36:37.028
Porcine, is that you?

36:37.128 --> 36:39.931
When we were young,
drag saved my life.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.699
And it saved yours, too.

36:41.799 --> 36:45.203
Have you forgotten
where we came from?

36:45.303 --> 36:48.139
Drag is a fight

36:48.239 --> 36:50.107
Drag is a protest

36:50.208 --> 36:54.845
Drag only reveals
who you really are

36:56.847 --> 37:01.252
If you wanna shine,
I'm letting you know this

37:01.352 --> 37:06.357
The kind of love we grow
can't grow in the dark

37:07.091 --> 37:10.962
The pride that we feel

37:11.062 --> 37:13.664
The power we hold

37:13.764 --> 37:18.436
In our high heels

37:18.536 --> 37:22.540
The rights
that we've earned

37:22.640 --> 37:25.276
Where we began

37:25.376 --> 37:28.079
And what we've learned

37:28.179 --> 37:33.184
Was built on drag

37:34.185 --> 37:36.554
Oooh

37:36.654 --> 37:39.890
You might know me
as Carl Preacher Teacher.

37:39.991 --> 37:43.060
But back in the day,
they called me

37:43.160 --> 37:46.063
Miss Ethel Sperman.

37:47.498 --> 37:52.503
[singing] The pride that I feel

37:53.771 --> 37:56.307
[singing] The power we hold
in our high heels

37:56.407 --> 37:58.809
[singing] In my high heels

37:58.909 --> 38:01.812
[singing] The rights
that we've earned

38:01.912 --> 38:03.180
[singing] Yeah, yeah

38:03.281 --> 38:07.485
[singing] Girl, it began
in what we wore

38:07.585 --> 38:09.086
[singing] It began in what we wore.

38:09.186 --> 38:10.588
[singing] Was built on

38:10.688 --> 38:14.592
[singing] Drag

38:14.692 --> 38:16.260
[singing] Was built on

38:16.360 --> 38:20.364
[singing] Drag

38:20.464 --> 38:22.800
[singing] Was built on

38:22.900 --> 38:25.903
[singing] Drag

38:26.003 --> 38:27.038
[laughs] [applause]

38:27.138 --> 38:29.206
- Yay!
- Wow.

38:29.307 --> 38:30.207
[upbeat music]

38:30.308 --> 38:31.208
Carl!

38:31.309 --> 38:33.010
What has gotten into you?

38:33.110 --> 38:36.180
I've been sitting
on a secret for way too long,

38:36.280 --> 38:38.683
and I couldn't hold it in
any longer.

38:41.018 --> 38:43.587
[singing] We found the
glitter under the gray

38:43.688 --> 38:46.590
We took the hay
and threw it away

38:46.691 --> 38:48.359
And found
these old dirty tights

38:48.459 --> 38:49.860
- They stink.
- Shut up, they're cute.

38:49.960 --> 38:52.396
[singing] Bum Tuck was
backwards when we showed up

38:52.496 --> 38:55.299
We knew exactly
what had to be done

38:55.399 --> 38:57.234
Put drag back into life

38:57.335 --> 38:59.637
- Yeah, we did.
- [singing] You lead with love

38:59.737 --> 39:02.540
- [singing] You don't give up
- [singing] You beat that face

39:02.640 --> 39:06.110
[singing] And show up anyway

39:06.210 --> 39:08.679
And now today

39:08.779 --> 39:11.349
Everybody's going wigloose

39:11.449 --> 39:14.251
Grab a wig
and put it on you

39:14.352 --> 39:17.121
There's a queen that
wants to come through

39:17.221 --> 39:20.124
Oh, everybody's going wigloose

39:20.224 --> 39:23.127
All these sisters
waiting for you

39:23.227 --> 39:25.730
There's a queen
that wants to come through

39:25.830 --> 39:28.032
Oh, everybody's going

39:28.132 --> 39:30.368
What do you say, honey?

39:30.468 --> 39:31.969
I say--

39:32.069 --> 39:33.604
I say

39:33.704 --> 39:38.709
the family that slays
together stays together.

39:42.513 --> 39:44.281
Can I get an amen?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.518
[singing] Amen

39:47.618 --> 39:50.054
That's too high
bring it back down

39:50.154 --> 39:51.155
Perfect.

39:51.255 --> 39:53.858
[singing] Everybody's
going wigloose

39:53.958 --> 39:56.761
Grab a wig
and put it on you

39:56.861 --> 39:59.663
There's a queen that
wants to come through

39:59.764 --> 40:02.767
Oh, everybody's going wigloose

40:02.867 --> 40:05.503
All these sisters
waiting for you

40:05.603 --> 40:08.372
There's a queen that
wants to come through

40:08.472 --> 40:12.476
Oh, everybody's going wigloose

40:12.576 --> 40:14.945
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

40:15.045 --> 40:17.214
[applause]

40:19.016 --> 40:22.353
[singing] The world
is your runway

40:22.453 --> 40:25.423
Category is,
everybody say glove.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.958
all: Glove.

40:28.058 --> 40:30.294
Up first, Loosey LaDuca.

40:30.394 --> 40:34.098
Hey, it's the shape
of LaDuca.

40:34.198 --> 40:35.433
This love letter

40:35.533 --> 40:37.134
to "The Creature
from the Black Lagoon"

40:37.234 --> 40:39.470
I designed from head to toe.

40:39.570 --> 40:42.540
I'm giving
a '50s-style swimsuit

40:42.640 --> 40:45.176
made out of latex, darling.

40:45.276 --> 40:49.046
And, of course, the gloves
are an opera length

40:49.146 --> 40:51.549
with a huge fin
down the sides.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.617
And I have webbed fingers.

40:53.717 --> 40:56.153
I mean,
who else is doing that?

40:56.253 --> 40:58.989
I'm letting them know
that I may be a creature,

40:59.089 --> 41:01.058
but I'm a creature of love.

41:01.158 --> 41:04.395
Yes, Miss Swamp Thing
if you're nasty.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.464
Hang on, kelp is on the way.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.033
[laughter]

41:09.133 --> 41:10.568
Anetra.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.703
We are back at limelight.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.939
She's totally
gloving this look.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.875
Mama, I am giving you
rave realness,

41:17.975 --> 41:19.076
and that's en fleur.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.511
Bitch, I love a rave.

41:20.611 --> 41:22.947
I will write a rave review
about a rave.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.616
So I'm giving you
a blue leather glove.

41:25.716 --> 41:27.885
And I have these laser lights
coming right out of my hands,

41:27.985 --> 41:30.187
because what is a rave
without lasers?

41:30.287 --> 41:33.390
Hit me with them laser beams.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.293
I am pumping, stomping,
and beaming this runway.

41:36.393 --> 41:38.162
I'm giving you hips, ass.

41:38.262 --> 41:40.397
I'm giving you a body
and topped it off

41:40.498 --> 41:42.466
with the signature scar
on my eye

41:42.566 --> 41:45.169
in this beautiful neon green.

41:45.269 --> 41:46.737
This look is lit.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.674
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.676
Oh, my God, so gorgeous.

41:52.776 --> 41:53.677
Yeah.

41:53.777 --> 41:55.713
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.948
Preacher Teacher wanted
everything black and white,

41:58.048 --> 42:01.085
so right now,
I'm giving a full 180.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.620
I'm in my sunshine era.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.322
I want them to be blinded
by the sunshine,

42:05.422 --> 42:07.424
the beautiful yellow
on my skin.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.159
The gloves are
attached to the gown.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.896
I have this really huge
taffeta boa that looks

42:11.996 --> 42:13.264
like it's part of the gloves.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.299
I have these beautiful,
long, dangling jewels

42:15.399 --> 42:16.300
I'm just holding.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.502
And, oh, it's opulent, bitch.

42:18.602 --> 42:19.603
It's over.

42:19.703 --> 42:22.273
Take that, 2 Chainz.

42:22.373 --> 42:25.676
If loving you is right,
I don't wanna be wrong.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.945
Luxx Noir London,

42:28.045 --> 42:30.648
Breaking 2:
Electric Boogaloo.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.449
You know how Luxx
got on the show?

42:32.550 --> 42:34.018
- No, how?
- Casting call.

42:34.952 --> 42:36.520
I think that my look

42:36.620 --> 42:38.822
is a very interesting take
on gloves--

42:38.923 --> 42:42.393
that emo kid in high school
who, like, broke their arm

42:42.493 --> 42:44.328
and, like, had
everybody sign it.

42:44.428 --> 42:47.932
The arm casts are signed
by my friends from home,

42:48.032 --> 42:50.334
so it's
a very special piece to me.

42:50.434 --> 42:52.736
I'm just giving them
the classic Luxx experience

42:52.836 --> 42:54.338
with a little edge to it.

42:54.438 --> 42:56.006
I may have two broken arms,

42:56.106 --> 42:58.742
but these legs
still pop, mama.

42:58.842 --> 43:01.078
Paris is burning--
uh, plaster of Paris.

43:01.178 --> 43:03.614
Yes, plaster of Paris.

43:03.714 --> 43:05.716
Salina EsTitties.

43:05.816 --> 43:07.551
If you can't glove yourself--

43:07.651 --> 43:10.054
How are you gonna glove
somebody else?

43:10.154 --> 43:11.522
Well, you know what
they say about huge hands.

43:11.622 --> 43:13.490
- No, what?
- A huge dick.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.726
[laughter]

43:15.826 --> 43:17.795
You know I love
a big masculine hand, honey.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.564
I'm giving you the biggest
gloves you've ever seen.

43:20.664 --> 43:22.600
It is just
out-of-the-box kooky.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.135
It's weird.
You're like, what's happening?

43:25.235 --> 43:27.204
I look like a full-on
cartoon character, bitch.

43:27.304 --> 43:29.773
Look at my hair.
It's so cute, very TLC vibes.

43:29.873 --> 43:32.176
I feel real cuntsy.
I feel real hip-hop.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.912
I feel like Cardi B
if Cardi B had giant hands.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.414
- You know what sounds good?
- What?

43:37.514 --> 43:38.549
Red Lobster.

43:38.649 --> 43:40.050
Yes.
[laughter]

43:42.052 --> 43:43.387
Sasha Colby.

43:43.487 --> 43:46.357
Ooh, she's in a league
of her own.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.792
Oh, mitt crew.

43:49.860 --> 43:53.130
I'm giving you
baseball girl realness,

43:53.230 --> 43:56.867
a glove outfit made
of pure baseball gloves.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.235
I came up with this concept.

43:58.335 --> 43:59.837
I was just thinking
of a new way

43:59.937 --> 44:01.005
to, like, use gloves.

44:01.105 --> 44:02.206
I still want it to be chic.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.707
I still wanna be high fashion.

44:03.807 --> 44:06.377
I'm feeling kind of like
Harley Quinn, like superhero,

44:06.477 --> 44:09.179
obviously, like, super sexy.
Sorry, I can't help it.

44:09.279 --> 44:11.448
Baby, I am feeling
like I'm gonna catch balls,

44:11.548 --> 44:14.084
grab balls.

44:14.184 --> 44:15.586
We balling, baby.

44:15.686 --> 44:18.922
Ooh, I think she plays
for the Houston Ass-tros.

44:20.057 --> 44:21.558
Swing, batter, batter.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.995
Welcome, ladykins.

44:25.095 --> 44:26.664
Just blanket statement.
I have to say,

44:26.764 --> 44:28.899
there have been
some extraordinary,

44:28.999 --> 44:30.734
epic Rusicals on the show.

44:30.834 --> 44:33.637
Tonight's
with the best of the best.

44:33.737 --> 44:35.439
It was like Broadway level.

44:35.539 --> 44:36.840
Y'all were incredible.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.709
The work you put into this...
[laughs]

44:38.809 --> 44:40.144
It showed,

44:40.244 --> 44:42.646
which makes our job
really, really difficult.

44:42.746 --> 44:45.783
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

44:47.317 --> 44:49.853
First up, Loosey LaDuca.

44:49.953 --> 44:51.388
I loved you in the Rusical.

44:51.488 --> 44:54.725
Right off the bat, I feel like
you carried it very strongly.

44:54.825 --> 44:56.960
It was just really,
really well done.

44:57.061 --> 44:58.162
It was professional.

44:58.262 --> 44:59.496
I hope you had fun

44:59.596 --> 45:01.498
because I feel
like you're a workaholic.

45:01.598 --> 45:04.034
I think tonight you did
"The Shape of Water" type

45:04.134 --> 45:05.602
of Creature from
the Black Lagoon.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.304
I enjoyed it.
It's cute.

45:07.404 --> 45:08.405
Thank you.

45:08.505 --> 45:10.574
Up next, Anetra.

45:10.674 --> 45:11.575
I like your outfit tonight.

45:11.675 --> 45:14.144
It's like drag Tron, future.

45:14.244 --> 45:15.412
I love it.

45:15.512 --> 45:17.414
Mama Bacon's not
the biggest part.

45:17.514 --> 45:20.584
But luckily, you managed
to take this solo

45:20.684 --> 45:22.019
and have a real moment.

45:22.119 --> 45:23.787
It was really powerful.

45:23.887 --> 45:26.657
Like, I felt like you
were there for these kids.

45:26.757 --> 45:30.327
It was so fulfilling
because you really understood

45:30.427 --> 45:32.262
what your role is.

45:32.362 --> 45:35.165
And not only did you
understand it, you lived it.

45:35.265 --> 45:38.802
So it was really fabulous
to watch.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.471
That lip-sync is
one that will stay with me

45:40.571 --> 45:41.972
for a very long time.

45:43.373 --> 45:46.877
Up next,
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

45:46.977 --> 45:49.079
Your solo was so well done.

45:49.179 --> 45:51.014
I thought you had
a good time with it.

45:51.115 --> 45:52.549
You were really into it.

45:52.649 --> 45:55.085
And then you get to play
this, you know, church lady

45:55.185 --> 45:58.589
who, by the way, we are
facing in real time out there.

45:58.689 --> 46:00.657
This is a real-life villain
as well.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.694
Somehow, I hate her,
but I was rooting

46:03.794 --> 46:05.195
for you in a weird way.

46:05.295 --> 46:07.264
And then, when you turned
the corner for the runway,

46:07.364 --> 46:09.133
I really gasped.

46:09.233 --> 46:11.201
Having just seen you
in the Rusical

46:11.301 --> 46:12.870
wearing something so different,

46:12.970 --> 46:14.872
and to just see this glamour,

46:14.972 --> 46:16.173
I mean, it was so cool.

46:16.273 --> 46:17.407
It's so beautiful.

46:17.508 --> 46:21.245
Honey, you did Houston
proud this evening.

46:21.345 --> 46:24.615
Up next, Luxx Noir London.

46:24.715 --> 46:27.518
This is my favorite
of all the concepts, for sure,

46:27.618 --> 46:28.919
on the runway.

46:29.019 --> 46:31.722
You know, it's kind
of, like, wonderfully Daria

46:31.822 --> 46:33.490
about it or something.

46:33.590 --> 46:34.691
- You know?
- Totally.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.093
Let's talk about you
in the Rusical.

46:36.193 --> 46:38.962
A little, tiny part,
and you didn't miss a beat.

46:39.062 --> 46:40.464
There's a thing
we go to after school.

46:40.564 --> 46:43.534
Come with me, flag,
wink, nudge, nudge.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.070
You know how I feel about
the gayetry that surrounds you.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.973
I just connect with the fact
that you live authentically,

46:50.073 --> 46:52.142
and it shows up
in everything that you do.

46:52.242 --> 46:54.378
I was gay
since I popped out the womb.

46:54.478 --> 46:57.147
- I love it.
- Thank you.

46:57.247 --> 47:00.484
I know that you initially
wanted the Heaven Bacon role,

47:00.584 --> 47:02.853
and you got into it
with Loosey.

47:02.953 --> 47:05.556
I would like
to clear this up.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.926
I had the role first,
and then I gave it to her.

47:09.026 --> 47:11.061
But you know,
that's in the past.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.329
But yeah, I had a great time.

47:12.429 --> 47:13.363
Thanks, Luxx.

47:13.463 --> 47:14.364
Thank you.

47:14.464 --> 47:17.701
Up next, Salina EsTitties.

47:17.801 --> 47:20.771
I loved seeing you
in the classroom as Tuck

47:20.871 --> 47:22.506
when I thought it
was Rosie O'Donnell

47:22.606 --> 47:23.540
in "A League of Their Own."

47:23.640 --> 47:24.808
Yeah.

47:24.908 --> 47:28.245
But I loved seeing you
go wholeheartedly

47:28.345 --> 47:32.182
into that look because
it's so different for Salina.

47:32.282 --> 47:34.351
Being out of EsTitties
on stage

47:34.451 --> 47:37.020
was really scary for me
because, like, I don't--

47:37.120 --> 47:39.857
[choking up] Jason doesn't go
out in the world like that.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.558
So to be on stage like that

47:41.658 --> 47:43.460
was really, like, vulnerable
for me.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.162
When all
of the characters, you know,

47:45.262 --> 47:46.997
finally come out in drag
at the ball,

47:47.097 --> 47:49.600
it was such a big change
from your character.

47:49.700 --> 47:51.668
Thought that was
a really job well done.

47:51.768 --> 47:53.670
You know, I just have
to face it, okay?

47:53.770 --> 47:55.806
There's so much going on
on the jumpsuit

47:55.906 --> 47:58.141
that I just now realized
you even had gloves on.

47:58.242 --> 48:00.744
[laughter]

48:00.844 --> 48:02.179
But, you know,
maybe it would have been

48:02.279 --> 48:04.581
even a more bold move
to just do some black with that

48:04.681 --> 48:07.618
and really service gloves.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.120
Up next, Sasha Colby.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.588
Can I ask you
why you chose this part?

48:11.688 --> 48:14.024
Sure.
I felt that I really wanted

48:14.124 --> 48:16.026
to show a trans woman

48:16.126 --> 48:18.662
not afraid to go for the laugh.

48:18.762 --> 48:20.530
And also, Carl spoke to me

48:20.631 --> 48:22.199
because he reminded me
of my dad.

48:22.299 --> 48:25.335
When he was alive,
he had a very overbearing wife.

48:25.435 --> 48:27.971
And he still managed
to find fun

48:28.071 --> 48:29.606
and really loved me in drag.

48:29.706 --> 48:32.542
I just have loved
seeing you, this season,

48:32.643 --> 48:35.312
take these kind of risks
to show us what you got.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.948
I think it was very smart
to choose this character.

48:38.048 --> 48:40.317
I got to tell you,
when I saw Carl, I thought,

48:40.417 --> 48:43.053
"Oh, my goodness,
Carl's kind of hot."

48:43.153 --> 48:45.422
Yes.

48:45.522 --> 48:47.090
And then, when you
transformed in the green dress,

48:47.190 --> 48:48.692
that number was so great.

48:48.792 --> 48:51.128
There was so much
in that solo of yours

48:51.228 --> 48:52.763
that just lit up the stage.

48:52.863 --> 48:54.665
And your look is
obviously very put together,

48:54.765 --> 48:57.534
but it's still got, like,
a lot of wit and charm to it.

48:57.634 --> 48:59.503
This is probably
the closest I've ever been

48:59.603 --> 49:00.637
to a baseball game,

49:00.737 --> 49:02.406
and I'm really excited
about it.

49:03.573 --> 49:06.176
It's so clever,
so chic, lovely.

49:06.276 --> 49:07.711
- Glovely.
- My God.

49:07.811 --> 49:09.713
Glovely.

49:09.813 --> 49:12.449
Queens, this week,
the competition

49:12.549 --> 49:15.052
is neck and neck,

49:15.152 --> 49:17.187
so I wanna hear from you.

49:17.287 --> 49:21.091
Who should go home
tonight, and why?

49:23.360 --> 49:25.095
Loosey?

49:25.195 --> 49:28.999
To go by track record...

49:31.068 --> 49:33.670
Um, Salina has been
in the bottom a lot.

49:33.770 --> 49:35.105
Hold up.

49:35.205 --> 49:37.808
After you came to me
and cried on my shoulder,

49:37.908 --> 49:40.177
now you wanna say
I should go home?

49:40.277 --> 49:41.578
Let's be real here.

49:41.678 --> 49:43.013
You don't like
Mistress and Luxx,

49:43.113 --> 49:45.015
so why don't you say
their names?

49:45.115 --> 49:46.049
Girl!

49:46.149 --> 49:47.084
Anetra?

49:47.184 --> 49:49.319
I feel bad saying statistics,

49:49.419 --> 49:50.687
but at the end of the day,

49:50.787 --> 49:52.122
that's the nitty gritty.

49:52.222 --> 49:54.891
I think I would have to say
Salina EsTitties.

49:56.293 --> 49:57.494
Okay.

49:58.695 --> 49:59.796
Mistress?

49:59.896 --> 50:01.198
If I had to be honest,
I'm tired of being

50:01.298 --> 50:02.432
at the Sasha Colby
meet and greet,

50:02.532 --> 50:04.368
and that's
my biggest competition.

50:04.468 --> 50:05.836
So, sorry, auntie.

50:05.936 --> 50:08.505
- All good.
- Luxx?

50:08.605 --> 50:10.640
You know, I think
really analyzing

50:10.741 --> 50:12.142
the lineup
that we have here tonight,

50:12.242 --> 50:14.211
I would say that Sasha Colby
does drag

50:14.311 --> 50:17.948
on a level
that is clean, cut, concise.

50:18.048 --> 50:20.350
But she just puts
that little extra thing on it

50:20.450 --> 50:23.353
that makes it
the Sasha Colby experience.

50:23.453 --> 50:27.691
Salina brings something
so unique with her perspective.

50:27.791 --> 50:29.493
It has so much heart.

50:29.593 --> 50:32.195
Mistress--she also
has a unique spin

50:32.295 --> 50:34.131
on what she does
because she's not afraid

50:34.231 --> 50:35.832
to push the boundary.

50:35.932 --> 50:37.934
That is something that
is very admirable.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.103
You never know what
to expect from Anetra,

50:40.203 --> 50:44.207
and I think that the unexpected
is something that I look for.

50:44.307 --> 50:47.944
Loosey does what she does
exceptionally well.

50:48.045 --> 50:51.081
However, Loosey's drag
I would have to say,

50:51.181 --> 50:52.849
for lack of a better word,
is a little

50:52.949 --> 50:54.985
on the more generic side.

50:56.286 --> 50:58.422
Everybody else on this lineup
brings something

50:58.522 --> 51:00.190
a little different and unique.

51:00.290 --> 51:02.459
So tonight, I'd have to say
Loosey for those reasons.

51:06.496 --> 51:07.831
Salina?

51:07.931 --> 51:09.599
I'd first like to start out saying

51:09.699 --> 51:12.335
that the girls who said
my name,

51:12.436 --> 51:13.837
each time I was in the bottom,

51:13.937 --> 51:15.605
they thought I was in
the top that week.

51:15.705 --> 51:18.241
So, you know, if we're looking

51:18.341 --> 51:20.343
for America's
next drag superstar,

51:20.444 --> 51:23.180
that's someone who's bringing
something fresh to the game.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.116
I don't see future of drag
when I see Loosey.

51:26.216 --> 51:27.384
Sasha?

51:27.484 --> 51:30.454
Well, since you can't
send them all home,

51:30.554 --> 51:33.156
I would send Loosey
or Luxx home,

51:33.256 --> 51:34.624
because they both have
two wins,

51:34.724 --> 51:36.226
they're tapping on my ass,

51:36.326 --> 51:39.296
and I need
the competition gone.

51:40.897 --> 51:44.034
Ladies, thank you
for your honesty.

51:44.134 --> 51:46.503
While you untuck
in the Werkroom,

51:46.603 --> 51:48.905
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:50.407 --> 51:52.676
Now just
between us, girlfriends,

51:52.776 --> 51:54.711
I wanna know what you think.

51:54.811 --> 51:56.446
Let's start with Loosey.

51:56.546 --> 51:58.615
Her characterization
as Heaven Bacon

51:58.715 --> 52:01.485
in the boy form--
I thought it was fantastic.

52:01.585 --> 52:04.488
And then, when she crossed
into drag, I kind of lost her.

52:04.588 --> 52:08.258
And I'm getting a feeling
that she is all business

52:08.358 --> 52:09.593
and not having fun.

52:09.693 --> 52:12.395
And it's interesting
that some of the queens

52:12.496 --> 52:13.630
were calling her out tonight.

52:13.730 --> 52:15.799
Loosey is really,
really good.

52:15.899 --> 52:20.203
It's just our other queens
having more special moments.

52:20.303 --> 52:22.105
And that's what we
have to ask ourselves.

52:22.205 --> 52:23.473
Anetra?

52:23.573 --> 52:26.510
I was continuously blown away
by her performance

52:26.610 --> 52:27.777
in the Rusical.

52:27.878 --> 52:30.180
It was so touching
and so beautiful.

52:30.280 --> 52:32.549
Anetra made us feel something.

52:32.649 --> 52:34.351
- She absolutely did.
- Mm-hmm.

52:34.451 --> 52:35.886
Mistress?

52:35.986 --> 52:38.355
The villain is the most
fun character, hands down.

52:38.455 --> 52:39.356
Michelle knows.

52:39.456 --> 52:41.158
Yes.

52:41.258 --> 52:43.593
And I--I really liked
her approach.

52:43.693 --> 52:47.063
I enjoyed watching
Mistress in this role.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.032
And I love what she said.

52:49.132 --> 52:52.235
I am gonna send home
my competition!

52:52.335 --> 52:54.771
That bitch, right there.

52:54.871 --> 52:56.206
Let's talk about Luxx.

52:56.306 --> 52:57.741
Before I discuss Luxx,
I'd like to address

52:57.841 --> 52:59.109
each of you individually.

52:59.209 --> 53:00.844
[laughter]

53:00.944 --> 53:02.379
Oh, my God.

53:02.479 --> 53:04.548
I could have watched that
for the rest of the week.

53:04.648 --> 53:05.682
That was great.

53:05.782 --> 53:07.050
I thought we did.

53:08.485 --> 53:10.887
I kind of want to add her
to my legal team, perhaps.

53:10.987 --> 53:13.056
[laughter]

53:13.156 --> 53:15.325
I mean, that
is star-quality stuff,

53:15.425 --> 53:16.860
and she's got it.

53:16.960 --> 53:18.261
And she'll tell you.

53:19.496 --> 53:20.730
Salina EsTitties.

53:20.830 --> 53:23.466
I felt like she really
thrived in the Rusical.

53:23.567 --> 53:27.370
The runway is not great.

53:27.470 --> 53:29.839
This ironically looks
a little second-hand,

53:29.940 --> 53:31.208
and I'm not talking
about the hands.

53:31.308 --> 53:33.176
I'm--

53:33.276 --> 53:35.345
There's a lot of work
to be done with the aesthetic.

53:35.445 --> 53:36.513
Yes.

53:36.613 --> 53:38.348
But she did
a good job tonight.

53:38.448 --> 53:39.549
Sasha Colby?

53:39.649 --> 53:40.617
You could feel the joy

53:40.717 --> 53:42.252
she was having as Carl.

53:42.352 --> 53:43.653
- You know I'm married, right?
- Yes.

53:43.753 --> 53:45.222
But Carl could still get it.

53:45.322 --> 53:46.923
Oh, yeah.

53:47.023 --> 53:48.892
And the way she
Patti LaBelled the hell out

53:48.992 --> 53:50.694
of that solo was amazing.

53:50.794 --> 53:52.729
A really, really
good night for her.

53:52.829 --> 53:54.331
Tickets are just
about sold out

53:54.431 --> 53:57.467
to the meet and greet, so come
see me, because I'm scalping.

53:57.567 --> 54:00.337
[laughter]

54:00.437 --> 54:01.771
Silence.

54:01.871 --> 54:03.840
I've made my decision.

54:03.940 --> 54:05.242
Bring back my girls.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.143
Welcome back, ladies.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.878
I've made some decisions.

54:08.979 --> 54:11.314
[dramatic music]

54:11.414 --> 54:14.517
Mistress Isabelle Brooks,

54:14.618 --> 54:16.586
you are safe.

54:16.686 --> 54:17.921
Thank you.

54:18.021 --> 54:19.723
You may step
to the back of the stage.

54:19.823 --> 54:23.093
[music continues]

54:23.193 --> 54:26.563
Luxx Noir London,

54:26.663 --> 54:27.664
you are safe.

54:27.764 --> 54:28.732
Thank you.

54:28.832 --> 54:33.703
[music continues]

54:33.803 --> 54:37.007
Sasha Colby,

54:37.107 --> 54:38.475
you are safe.

54:38.575 --> 54:41.177
[music continues]

54:41.278 --> 54:43.647
[suspenseful music]

54:43.747 --> 54:45.615
[music continues]

54:45.715 --> 54:49.686
Anetra, as Mama Bacon,
you served up

54:49.786 --> 54:53.356
a heaping helping
of love and emotion

54:53.456 --> 54:55.325
that we'll never forget.

54:55.425 --> 54:56.726
Condragulations.

54:56.826 --> 54:58.395
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

54:58.495 --> 55:00.230
- [applause]
- Yes!

55:01.698 --> 55:04.367
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

55:04.467 --> 55:06.002
Thank you.

55:06.102 --> 55:08.038
So this is
my second challenge win.

55:08.138 --> 55:10.540
I can't say "fuck,"
so I'm going to say "forking."

55:10.640 --> 55:15.278
I am so forking excited
to win this forking challenge.

55:15.378 --> 55:16.446
I might cry.

55:18.882 --> 55:22.719
Loosey LaDuca,
Salina EsTitties,

55:22.819 --> 55:27.457
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

55:27.557 --> 55:30.560
Two queens stand before me.

55:30.660 --> 55:34.464
Ladies, this is
your last chance to impress me

55:34.564 --> 55:38.735
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:40.970 --> 55:43.006
The time has come

55:43.106 --> 55:48.111
for you
to lip-synch for your life.

55:48.745 --> 55:51.514
[dramatic music]

55:51.614 --> 55:52.849
Here I am, once again.

55:52.949 --> 55:55.185
Do I deserve to be
in the bottom?

55:55.285 --> 55:57.420
No, but I'm a fighter.

55:57.520 --> 56:00.357
I am going to serve
the EsTitties experience

56:00.457 --> 56:01.691
with these dumb-ass gloves.

56:01.791 --> 56:04.694
You ready?

56:04.794 --> 56:09.399
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

56:10.133 --> 56:12.569
[percussive music]

56:12.669 --> 56:17.474
[music continues]

56:17.574 --> 56:19.275
[singing] It doesn't hurt me

56:19.376 --> 56:20.910
Yeah, yeah, yo

56:21.010 --> 56:23.413
Do you wanna feel
how it feels?

56:23.513 --> 56:25.081
Yeah, yeah, yo

56:25.181 --> 56:28.151
Do you wanna know, know
that it doesn't hurt me?

56:28.251 --> 56:29.853
Yeah, yeah, yo

56:29.953 --> 56:33.923
Do you wanna hear about
the deal that I'm making?

56:34.023 --> 56:38.461
Is there so much hate
for the ones we love

56:38.561 --> 56:43.366
Well, tell me we both
matter, don't we?

56:43.466 --> 56:48.471
You, you, it's you and me

56:49.672 --> 56:50.540
Come on, Salina.
Eat her up, bitch.

56:50.640 --> 56:52.609
Take them off.
Take them off.

56:52.709 --> 56:55.779
[singing] If I could make
a deal with God

56:55.879 --> 56:58.982
And get him to swap
our places

56:59.082 --> 57:01.117
Be running up that road

57:01.217 --> 57:03.420
Be running up that hill

57:03.520 --> 57:05.321
Be running up
that building

57:05.422 --> 57:08.792
Even with these big hot-dog
fingers, bitch, I am giving.

57:08.892 --> 57:10.660
[singing] Come on, baby

57:10.760 --> 57:13.196
Come on, darling

57:13.296 --> 57:17.600
Let me steal
this moment from you now

57:17.700 --> 57:19.569
- Come on, angel
- Come on.

57:19.669 --> 57:21.371
[singing] Come on,
come on, darling

57:21.471 --> 57:22.705
Come on.

57:22.806 --> 57:25.875
[singing] Let's exchange
the experience

57:25.975 --> 57:27.844
- Oh!
- Get it.

57:27.944 --> 57:30.346
Get it.

57:30.447 --> 57:34.818
[singing] So if I could make
a deal with God

57:34.918 --> 57:39.022
And I get him
to swap our places

57:39.122 --> 57:44.127
I'd be running up that road,
be running up that hill

57:44.727 --> 57:47.997
With no problems

57:48.097 --> 57:52.669
So if I could,

57:52.769 --> 57:57.707
Be running up that hill

57:58.308 --> 58:01.711
With no problems

58:01.811 --> 58:05.882
If only I could
be running up that hill

58:05.982 --> 58:10.987
If only I could
be running up that hill

58:14.224 --> 58:16.726
- [applause]
- Yes!

58:21.197 --> 58:24.234
Ladies,
I've made my decision.

58:24.334 --> 58:27.237
[tense music]

58:27.337 --> 58:30.039
[music continues]

58:30.139 --> 58:31.608
Loosey LaDuca.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.943
Shantay, you stay.

58:34.043 --> 58:35.979
You may join the other girls.

58:36.079 --> 58:37.146
Thank you.

58:39.782 --> 58:41.784
Salina EsTitties,

58:41.885 --> 58:44.554
thanks for the mammaries.

58:44.654 --> 58:47.490
Now sashay away.

58:47.590 --> 58:49.225
Thank you guys so much.

58:51.160 --> 58:52.195
Are you sure?

58:52.295 --> 58:54.564
[laughter]

58:55.999 --> 59:00.470
EsTitties, EsTitties,
my titties, not your titties.

59:00.570 --> 59:02.539
All right, baby,
the titties are coming.

59:05.408 --> 59:09.345
I let myself dim my light
here because of bitches.

59:09.445 --> 59:12.315
And don't let no bitch
dim your light, ho.

59:12.415 --> 59:14.117
I also didn't win
any fucking money here.

59:14.217 --> 59:17.186
So I need all the cointadas.
Fuck those hos.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.222
You bring it over
to EsTitties, okay?

59:22.625 --> 59:24.861
Condragulations, queens.

59:24.961 --> 59:28.197
And remember, if you can't
love yourself, how the hell

59:28.298 --> 59:29.566
are you gonna love
somebody else?

59:29.666 --> 59:31.167
Can I get an amen up in here?

59:31.267 --> 59:32.435
all: Amen.

59:32.535 --> 59:34.003
Now let the music play.

59:34.103 --> 59:35.872
A little bit of love

59:35.972 --> 59:38.741
Goes a long, long way

59:38.841 --> 59:41.311
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

59:41.411 --> 59:43.880
Can you feel the love?

59:47.150 --> 59:48.718
Next time on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

59:48.818 --> 59:52.021
You need to transform
these educators

59:52.121 --> 59:54.324
into glamazons.

59:54.424 --> 59:58.561
Okay, girl, Loosey kind of
set me up this week to fail.

59:58.661 --> 59:59.896
You two are such family,

59:59.996 --> 1:00:01.030
you're gonna fight
at Christmas.

1:00:01.130 --> 1:00:03.333
Both of you
gave me the attitude.

1:00:03.433 --> 1:00:04.601
I was getting the eye.

1:00:04.701 --> 1:00:07.070
I see zero
family resemblance.

1:00:07.170 --> 1:00:11.441
Everything that I said on
the runway is 110% how I feel.

1:00:11.541 --> 1:00:16.279
Ooh, try to screw me over,
it will never end well.

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:20.083
[singing] A little bit of love

1:00:20.183 --> 1:00:22.652
Goes a long, long way

1:00:22.752 --> 1:00:25.588
Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:00:25.688 --> 1:00:30.293
A little bit of love
goes a long, long way

1:00:30.393 --> 1:00:32.962
Turn it around,
when you up and say

1:00:33.062 --> 1:00:36.132
Everybody say love,
love, love, love

1:00:36.232 --> 1:00:41.204
Oh, love, love, love, love,
love, oh, love, oh, oh, oh

1:00:42.372 --> 1:00:44.841
Love, can you feel
the love
