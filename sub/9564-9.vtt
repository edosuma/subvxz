32 cabs, not that you'd care.
It's a stupid fuss over a birthday party.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.317
Does it give respect to God?
Does it promote peace?

07:35.400 --> 07:38.358
- No, Dad.
- Does it heIp the poor? It's an affront.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.273
So why do we have to do it anyway?
I don't even want a party.

07:41.360 --> 07:46.115
Because I Iove that woman
more than these Iegs I drag myseIf aIong on,
