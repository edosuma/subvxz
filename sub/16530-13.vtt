00:06.374 --> 00:07.275
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.908 --> 00:08.909
sexually based offenses

00:08.942 --> 00:11.512
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.148
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.182 --> 00:16.084
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.117 --> 00:17.351
are members of an elite squad

00:17.385 --> 00:19.420
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.389
These are their stories.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.371
- What can I do for you, Rodney?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.440
- Go to dinner with me
tomorrow night.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.243
Polo Club, Locanda Verde, Nobu.
Whatever you want.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.277
- I'm working.

00:43.311 --> 00:46.214
- Forget dinner.
Just marry me.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.449
Okay, all right, marriage might
be a bit premature.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.118
So let's compromise.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.320
Okay, all right.
Paris it is.

00:52.353 --> 00:54.488
You and me, strolling down
the Champs-ElysÃ©es--

00:54.522 --> 00:57.158
- She's not into you, dude.
Deal with it.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.626
- You her boyfriend?

00:58.659 --> 00:59.493
- No.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.230
- Then shut up.
- Just back off, Rodney.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.364
You hear me?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.365
- I love when you get mad.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.184

01:23.217 --> 01:24.452
- Go home, Rodney.
I'm not in the mood.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.586
- Okay, all right, hey,
but I'm a good guy.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.556
I swear, I'm sorry for being
so annoying.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.558
But--
- Whoa, don't touch me!

to say good night.

Get off!

Just relax.

Aah!

Works at a bar

02:03.424 --> 02:05.493

and raped her on the front seat.

[dark music]

02:10.564 --> 02:13.301
- We are so sorry
about what happened.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.169
Can we ask you some questions?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.937
- Uh, yeah, sure.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.240
- Did you see the man
who attacked you?

02:19.273 --> 02:21.542
- No, 'cause he came up
from behind me

02:21.575 --> 02:22.643
when I opened the car door.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.678
So, no I didn't see him.
I'm sorry.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.315
- No, it's okay.
Don't worry.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.450
- Did you hear his voice?

02:29.483 --> 02:33.354
- Uh, yeah, 'cause afterward
he talked a lot.

02:33.387 --> 02:34.355
*

02:34.388 --> 02:35.689
- What did he say?

02:35.723 --> 02:38.259
- That he was sorry.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.528
And then he started to cry
and said it wasn't his fault

02:40.561 --> 02:42.296
because he was born
to be a rapist

02:42.330 --> 02:45.299
and it was in his genes.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.702

[dramatic music]

02:53.807 --> 03:01.215

03:37.017 --> 03:42.022
I opened the door,
someone grabbed me from behind,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.258
and I elbowed him.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.793
But he grabbed my arms anyway,

03:45.826 --> 03:48.329
'cause he was really strong.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.531
And he put me down
on the back seat,

03:50.564 --> 03:52.633
put a hand over my mouth,

03:52.666 --> 03:56.937
pulled down my underwear,
my tights,

03:56.970 --> 04:01.442
and then--then he raped me.

04:01.475 --> 04:04.545
- And you told my detectives
that he said something.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.848
- Yeah, he just kept saying,
"I'm sorry."

04:10.951 --> 04:12.286
But I think I know who did it.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.888
- You do?
Great.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.290
Do you know his name?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.925
- Rodney.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.293
- Okay.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.594
- He comes to the bar a lot.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.297
And he's always flirting with me
and asking me out,

04:23.331 --> 04:24.965
and I say no,
but he keeps trying.

04:24.998 --> 04:28.436
- And he tried again last night?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.870
- Yeah.

04:29.903 --> 04:34.041
After I closed up,
he followed me to my car.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.343
[solemn music]

04:35.376 --> 04:39.613
- So, you told my detectives

04:39.647 --> 04:42.616
that the assailant cried

04:42.650 --> 04:44.452
and that he told you
that the reason

04:44.485 --> 04:48.456
that he assaulted you was
because of his genetics?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.623
- Yeah.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.992
*

04:52.025 --> 04:54.428
It was odd.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.465
I mean, is that real?

04:57.498 --> 05:01.902
- No, that's not real,
and that's...

05:01.935 --> 05:03.904
that's ridiculous.

05:03.937 --> 05:10.344
*

05:10.378 --> 05:12.012
- It's the best car
in the showroom.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.114
I sold one to Derek Jeter
two months ago.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.550
He calls me once a week to thank
me for talking him into it.

05:16.584 --> 05:19.353
Hand to God, he said
it's the best car he's ever had.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.655
- Rodney Marsh, we need to talk.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.090
- I'm in the middle
of a deal, guys.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.925
- We're in the middle
of a deal, too.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.927
Looks like you might be
on the wrong end of it.

05:26.960 --> 05:27.961
- Excuse me?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.630
- Yeah, we want to speak to you
about last night.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.632
- A woman named Jessica Walcott.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.367
- Uh, give me two minutes,
Mitch.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.702
My prices are so low,
the cops assume

05:34.735 --> 05:36.604
I'm committing some sort
of a crime.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.440
[laughs]

05:39.473 --> 05:41.575
Your timing
is suboptimal, guys.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.377
I got this clown
in the kill zone.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.512
Even money,
I close him by lunch.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.646
So let's make this quick.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.647
- All right.
What happened between you

05:46.680 --> 05:48.048
and Jessica Walcott last night?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.450
- The bartender?
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.751
- I asked her out
and she said no.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.553
[chuckles]
That a felony or something?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.555
- No, but sexual assault is.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.023
- What are you talking about?

05:56.056 --> 05:58.025
- She was raped.

05:58.058 --> 05:58.859
And you were the last person

05:58.892 --> 06:00.528
to talk to her
before it happened.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.663
- Even money,
you're the guy, Rodney.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.965
- I'll take that bet.
'Cause I absolutely,

06:04.998 --> 06:07.401
unequivocally did not
attack that girl.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.469
I swear to God.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.938
No, I-I was just flirting
with her.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.573
And then after the bar closed,
I saw her walking

06:12.606 --> 06:15.175
down the street,
so I-I took another shot.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.677
- So you refused to take no
for an answer.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.979
Is that what you're saying?
- Not like that.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.481
I'd never rape somebody.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.582
- Why'd you follow her
to her car?

06:21.615 --> 06:23.684
- I didn't follow her.
I talked to her outside the bar

06:23.717 --> 06:25.085
for, like, a minute,
she blew me off,

06:25.118 --> 06:27.455
so I walked away
in the opposite direction.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.056
I got a QuikRide and went home.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.558
- Well, since you're innocent,
I'm sure you won't mind

06:30.591 --> 06:32.159
giving us a DNA sample.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.428
- Swab away.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.465
- [sighs]

06:37.498 --> 06:40.067
Security cam footage
from a bodega near the bar.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.769
It shows
Rodney grabbing Jessica,

06:41.802 --> 06:44.071
but then she pulls away,
walks off.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.806
He watches her
for a couple of seconds,

06:45.839 --> 06:47.541
but he heads
the other direction.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.209
- Corroborates his story,
for now.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.377
- Uh, more like forever.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.481
- Rodney's DNA doesn't match
the semen in the rape kit.

06:53.514 --> 06:57.050
But the good news is,

06:57.084 --> 07:00.488
we got a familial hit
to a guy named Mark Brown.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.723
Arrested in 2013.
Rape one.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.757
Where is he now?

07:03.791 --> 07:06.727
- He's doing 7-10 in Sing Sing.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.996
He raped a math teacher
in the Bronx.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.465
- Okay, so go to Sing Sing,
talk to this Mark guy,

07:11.499 --> 07:13.467
and get the names
of all male family members

07:13.501 --> 07:15.035
living in the area.

07:17.838 --> 07:21.041
- You want me to tell you
if I got family in the area?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.076
What else you want me to do?
Wash your car?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.812
- No, we have people
who do that.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.146
One of the few perks
to being a cop.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.715
- Listen, we talked to
the warden,

07:27.748 --> 07:29.082
he said if you help us out,
he's gonna

07:29.116 --> 07:31.719
look into that request
you made for a TV.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.554
- Have him put it in writing.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.622
- If you don't care about

07:34.655 --> 07:37.090
a critically injured
family member,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.692
that's on you.
- Critically injured?

07:38.726 --> 07:39.727
Wait, what are you
talking about?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.529
- We're here looking for blood.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.764
- Yeah, there was a car crash
and somebody got hurt.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.833
He needs blood,
so we ran his DNA,

07:45.866 --> 07:47.801
found out that
you're a familial match.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.503
- Now do you have
any family in the city?

07:49.537 --> 07:50.538
Jersey?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.805
- Yeah, my brother Nick.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.741
I mean--he okay?
He gonna make it?

07:53.774 --> 07:54.908
- Not sure.
- Well, if he gets

07:54.942 --> 07:57.645
his transfusion, the docs think
he's gonna pull through.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.580
- Oh, God.
It's gotta be Nick.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.849
He lives in
the East Village, but...

08:01.882 --> 08:03.551
My mom know about this?

08:03.584 --> 08:05.185
- Uh, no we haven't been able
to contact her yet.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.654
But listen, do you have
Nick's address

08:06.687 --> 08:07.855
and where he works, maybe?

08:07.888 --> 08:10.724
- He's an accountant at one of
those giant accounting firms.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.893
- Thanks for your time.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.867

- Yes?

08:19.900 --> 08:23.136
- NYPD,
can you come with us, please?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.673
- You here about the bartender?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.274
- Yeah,
how'd you know that, Nick?

08:27.307 --> 08:29.610
- I heard--I heard
someone attacked her.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.579
- You heard?
From who?

08:31.612 --> 08:34.081
- A guy I-I know at the bar.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.549
- All right, well, why don't you
come down with us, huh?

08:35.583 --> 08:36.684
- [stammering]

08:36.717 --> 08:39.887
*

08:39.920 --> 08:41.822
I did it.
Okay?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.824
I raped her.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.560
*

08:46.594 --> 08:49.096
I couldn't help it.

08:49.129 --> 08:52.766
I was born this way.
I was born to be a rapist.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.668
*

08:54.702 --> 08:56.704
- All right,
stand up and turn around.

08:56.737 --> 09:02.209
*

09:02.242 --> 09:04.612
- You have the right
to remain silent.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.715
Anything you say
can and will be used against you

09:12.853 --> 09:12.986
.

09:13.020 --> 09:13.654
- My father was a monster.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.059
He did seven years in jail
for rape, three counts.

09:19.092 --> 09:22.630
He said
he couldn't help himself.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.633
It was in his DNA,
which means it's in mine.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.367
It was just a matter of time.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.302
It's in my blood.
It's who I am.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.605
- Nick, enough.

09:31.639 --> 09:34.041
My client has information
that can help you

09:34.074 --> 09:37.711
solve an outstanding case
involving a serial rapist.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.847
- Let's hear it.
- Sure.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.949
After you talk to the DA
and make us a deal.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.951
- Yeah, we're happy to run that
up the flag pole,

09:43.984 --> 09:45.786
but we are gonna need
a little taste.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.820
- You gotta give us a preview,

09:46.854 --> 09:49.322
something that tells us
that you're credible.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.860
- I know who
the River Rapist is.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.829
- The River Rapist?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.831
You know him?

09:57.865 --> 09:58.866
- What's his name?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.868
- Not yet.

10:00.901 --> 10:04.772
Just what we discussed.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.940
- He gags his victims
with socks.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.709
- Congratulations,
you read a newspaper.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.844
- You didn't let me finish.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.748
Wool socks, 'cause they're thick
and they're coarse.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.650
And it makes the girls gag.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.652
And the weapon--

10:18.686 --> 10:20.053
it's not a knife,
like they said in the papers.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.989
It's an ice pick.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.124
And he smells like cigars.
I guarantee you

10:24.157 --> 10:26.326
that some of the victims
mentioned that to the police

10:26.359 --> 10:28.028
because he's always smoking
these cheap, thin cigars.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.764
The ones with
the plastic tip thing.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.866
- Okay,
we'll talk to the detectives

10:32.900 --> 10:33.934
investigating the case,

10:33.967 --> 10:37.971
and if what you said checks out,
we'll be in touch.

10:38.005 --> 10:41.374
- Tell the bartender that I--

10:41.408 --> 10:43.977
I'm really sorry, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.446
You want us to
send her flowers, too?

10:46.479 --> 10:47.881
[tense music]

10:47.915 --> 10:48.882
[door closes]

10:48.916 --> 10:49.917
*

10:49.950 --> 10:52.119
- I ran the perp's story by
the lead detective

10:52.152 --> 10:53.120
on the River Rapist case.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.922
- And?
- It checks out.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.790
The socks, the cheap cigars,

10:56.824 --> 10:57.891
it looks like
he's telling the truth.

10:57.925 --> 10:58.892
- Great, I'll call Barb

10:58.926 --> 11:00.460
and see what kind of deal
he's willing to make.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.895
- Make sure you tell him
this guy claims

11:01.929 --> 11:03.764
he was born with the rape gene.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.065
The excuses
these guys come up with

11:05.098 --> 11:07.034
never ceases to amaze me.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.769
- Well,
why don't you call Jessica

11:08.802 --> 11:10.771
and tell her that
we arrested the assailant,

11:10.804 --> 11:11.972
and he confessed,

11:12.005 --> 11:13.173
and he wants a plea deal?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.908
- Okay.

11:18.812 --> 11:22.349
- You obviously didn't tell
Carisi about your father.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.784
- Neither did you.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.953
- It's not my place.

11:25.986 --> 11:28.055
But are you--
are you okay

11:28.088 --> 11:29.957
with all this talk
about genetics?

11:29.990 --> 11:32.993
- Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.103
- So Noah and a little girl
had a--a disagreement.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.973
She had the toy he wanted
or the cupcake.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.777
- Yes, and I say,
what if it's something else?

11:49.810 --> 11:51.144
What if it's something more?

11:51.178 --> 11:52.379
- What do you mean?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.448
- Well,
sometimes I worry that...

11:55.482 --> 11:58.718
- That Noah may turn
into his father?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.222
- Yes.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.224
- Did you turn into your father?

12:04.257 --> 12:08.495
- Well, I didn't turn into a
rapist, if that's what you mean.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.931
But I think about him
all the time,

12:10.964 --> 12:13.867
and I think about what he did

12:13.901 --> 12:15.135
and the choices that he made.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.970
I think about it a lot.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.539
And I've been dealing with this

12:19.572 --> 12:20.874
for quite a long time,

12:20.908 --> 12:22.209
even before I met you.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.812
- Mm.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.514
- And no matter...
[chuckles softly]

12:27.547 --> 12:31.518
What I do, I still worry that--

12:31.551 --> 12:33.520
- About what, Olivia?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.890
[solemn music]

12:36.924 --> 12:40.894
- That somehow his...

12:40.928 --> 12:44.898
darkness will overpower my life
and my choices,

12:44.932 --> 12:48.035
because...
I've been there before.

12:48.068 --> 12:52.806
I've been angry.
I've been...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.908
violent.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.810
- I know.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.245
And I know how much
that frightened you,

12:58.278 --> 13:02.883
but I don't believe
that's who you really are.

13:02.916 --> 13:03.917
*

13:03.951 --> 13:06.854
My opinion: your strength,
your moral compass,

13:06.887 --> 13:09.222
your belief systems...

13:09.256 --> 13:12.025
more powerful than
your father's DNA.

13:12.059 --> 13:16.496
*

13:16.529 --> 13:19.599
But there is no such thing as
a rape gene, Olivia.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.602
Whether you're male or female,
there just isn't.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.006
*

13:29.176 --> 13:30.177
- I talked
to Lieutenant Benson.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.511
It sounds like
you can help us out.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.580
So I'm willing
to offer you a deal.

13:33.613 --> 13:37.584
Rape two, assuming
your information is credible.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.052
- I was thinking--
- Rape two is as good

13:39.086 --> 13:41.288
as it's going to get,
so say yes.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.523
Or we're walking.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.627
- You okay with that?

13:47.660 --> 13:50.530
- Yes, that, uh...
that sounds fair to me.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.600
- So what is
the River Rapist's name?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.602
- I know him by Sam.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.337
- You don't know his full name?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.139
- No.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.141
- You know where he lives?
Works?

14:01.174 --> 14:05.045
- No.
- So what the hell do you know?

14:05.078 --> 14:08.115
- Where he'll be
tonight at 10:00.

14:10.550 --> 14:13.954
[dark music]

14:13.987 --> 14:16.089
- Our Father,
who art in heaven,

14:16.123 --> 14:18.058
hallowed be thy name.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.660
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

14:20.693 --> 14:23.663
on Earth, as it is in heaven.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.966
Give us this day
our daily bread.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.201
- Really?
Sexual predators praying about

14:28.235 --> 14:30.103
not trespassing against others?

14:30.137 --> 14:31.271
- It's like
a "Saturday Night Live" skit,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.006
but it's real.
- [sighs]

14:33.040 --> 14:35.575
There's a lot of that
going around these days.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.678
- Hey, man.
Can I start?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.014
- Go for it.

14:41.048 --> 14:45.652
- Um, I was out,
drinking a beer,

14:45.685 --> 14:49.990
talking to this
pretty bartender.

14:50.023 --> 14:54.161
And I began to spin out.

14:54.194 --> 14:58.698
I started having these feelings.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.335
And, uh,
I couldn't control myself.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.605
And then I did the thing
that I vowed I'd never do.

15:05.638 --> 15:08.308
*

15:08.341 --> 15:10.710
I raped her.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.580
- How could you do that?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.415
*

15:15.448 --> 15:17.417
We had a deal.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.420
That we were gonna
fight this thing together.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.654
- Where is Sam?

15:21.688 --> 15:22.689
I haven't heard Nick
say his name yet.

15:22.722 --> 15:23.823
- [sighs]
Who knows?

15:23.856 --> 15:26.994
Maybe the River Rapist didn't
feel like purging tonight.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.997
- I made a mistake.
And I am sorry.

15:30.030 --> 15:33.400
- Okay.
I'm not buying it.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.970
- Would you judge an alcoholic
for sipping a drink?

15:37.004 --> 15:40.307
He's not responsible
for his genetics.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.409
Neither are you.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.711
*

15:44.744 --> 15:47.414
Or you.

15:47.447 --> 15:51.318
So don't blame yourself.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.253
Don't hate yourself.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.756
- Are you kidding me?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.092
I despise myself.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.760
*

16:00.793 --> 16:02.695
Every day,
I wake up and I think,

16:02.729 --> 16:07.234
is this the day that
I-I finally fulfill my destiny?

16:07.267 --> 16:09.269
[door closes]
The day that I ruin my life

16:09.302 --> 16:12.105
and the life
of an innocent woman.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
*

16:14.174 --> 16:17.077
- Hey.
- [laughs]

16:17.110 --> 16:18.411
- Wait, hold on, somebody new is
joining the group.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.412
- Chris.
- Hi, Sam.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.213
- Oh, it's him, it's him.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.414
Somebody just said his name,
come on.

16:21.448 --> 16:22.515
- Yeah?

16:22.549 --> 16:25.018
- Nick was just telling us
about a recent transgression

16:25.052 --> 16:29.089
and Will was expressing
his disappointment.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.125
They had been supporting
one another.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.227
- Sorry to hear about that.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.263
But it happens.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.031
- Thanks.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.668
What about you, Sam?
How's it going?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.736
- Good.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.340
I feel like
I've turned a page.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.176
I went on a proper date
last night

16:49.209 --> 16:51.178
with a great woman.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.679
- That's terrific.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.682
- Mr. Witt, do you think
it's possible for Sam

16:55.715 --> 16:58.318
or any of us to have
a normal relationship?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.821
- I do.
But it's a process.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.356
- Even though
he's assaulted three women?

17:03.390 --> 17:06.726
- Whoa.
Why are you going so negative?

17:06.759 --> 17:09.196
- Just trying to make
sense of this for myself.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.697
- Then talk about your own crap.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.065
- I'm in the same boat.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.733
I just...

17:13.766 --> 17:15.502
I want to know what's possible
for people like us.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.504
People who have raped.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.372
- Why do you have to
use the R word?

17:19.406 --> 17:20.707
- Huh?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.209
- We're all doing
the best we can.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.177
- Good question.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.179
- This doesn't look good.
- Wait, give him a chance.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.448
- Well, we're not doing the
best we can if we just lie--

17:28.481 --> 17:29.482
- Why are you judging me, man?

17:29.516 --> 17:32.452
- Everybody calm down!

17:32.485 --> 17:33.786
Now.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.725
We're here to support
one another.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.228
- Nick's asking
too many questions.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.496
Accusing people of doing things.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.132
I've been here ten times.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.200
I never heard him
talk about rape.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.836
Or other people's business.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.340
But tonight--tonight he's all up
in Sam's situation,

17:53.373 --> 17:55.442
getting specific.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.876
You a snitch?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.211
- No.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.414
[tense music]

18:01.448 --> 18:03.283
- Huh?
- Oh.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.218
- Put the knife down.
Put the knife down!

18:05.252 --> 18:06.419
- Hey, Chris.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.421
- All units move in, move in.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.224
*

18:11.258 --> 18:12.192
- You working for the police,
Nick?

18:12.225 --> 18:13.126
- Put it down, Chris.
Put down the knife.

18:13.160 --> 18:13.926
- Where is it?
- You working off a case?

18:13.960 --> 18:17.264
- No, come on,
I'm an accountant!

18:17.297 --> 18:18.498
[panting]

18:18.531 --> 18:20.867
*

18:20.900 --> 18:23.870
- You lying son of a bitch.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.505
Son of a bitch!
- Kill me.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.840
I deserve it.
I deserve it.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.376
- Drop that knife!

18:29.409 --> 18:32.579
Back off or I will shoot you!

18:32.612 --> 18:33.846
Drop the knife.
Drop the knife!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.915
- Hey, you there!
Freeze!

18:35.948 --> 18:38.251
Freeze.
Right there.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.586
Put your hands
on your head, now.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.388
- Get over there.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.822
- Turn around.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.791
Get on your knees.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.260
- Everybody sit on that curb.
Everybody!

18:47.294 --> 18:50.830
Hand up, nice and slow.
Do not reach.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.566
Handcuff this man.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.269
- We are all gonna go down
to the precinct

18:56.303 --> 18:58.905
and continue this fascinating
group chat.

19:06.613 --> 19:06.746
.

19:06.779 --> 19:07.380
- So Nick was telling the truth.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.451
He really was part of
a rape therapy group.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.552
Too bad we didn't get
a full confession.

19:12.585 --> 19:13.853
- Oh, we tried like hell.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.489
But they pushed
Sam Dalton too far,

19:16.523 --> 19:19.359
things went sideways,
and we had to break it up.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.462
- You have something
to hold him on?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.596
- No.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.732
- Invent something.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.501
- They're flawed, no question.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.471
But they're decent.
They're trying.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.939
- How about we talk about
Sam Dalton?

19:32.972 --> 19:34.774
He ever confess to you,
tell you he assaulted

19:34.807 --> 19:36.476
three different women?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.745
- The members of my group
discuss lots of things.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.881
- Well, all I care about
are those things involving rape.

19:41.914 --> 19:45.618
- The purpose of this
organization is to support men

19:45.652 --> 19:47.454
with nowhere to turn.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.457
- [scoffs]
- No one to talk to.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.593
We listen, we encourage,

19:53.626 --> 19:55.595
and most importantly,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.530
we don't judge.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.900
Most of the members have never
done anything wrong.

20:00.933 --> 20:04.437
- Like I said, Richard,
my focus here is Sam Dalton.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.906
Or anyone else
who's committed a crime.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.775
- I refuse to betray the group.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.477
- Yeah, but you're okay

20:10.510 --> 20:11.878
betraying three
innocent victims?

20:11.911 --> 20:13.980
Three women who go to sleep
at night and wonder

20:14.013 --> 20:15.982
if the cops are ever
gonna catch the son of a bitch

20:16.015 --> 20:17.417
who attacked them.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.486
- If I betray anyone,

20:19.519 --> 20:21.921
I lose all credibility,

20:21.954 --> 20:25.024
and the group vanishes.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.796
And lots of decent men who are
fighting their impulses--

20:29.829 --> 20:34.601
their--their genetics--
will have nowhere to go.

20:34.634 --> 20:38.605
Then there's not just
one rapist, there's ten.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.407
20.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.841
100.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.510
- Decent point.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.011
Better they exorcise
their demons in a warehouse

20:45.044 --> 20:47.480
than act on
their violent impulses.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.682
- In theory.
But in reality,

20:49.716 --> 20:51.584
it could make things worse.

20:51.618 --> 20:54.687
It gives them a forum
to rationalize

20:54.721 --> 20:58.925
and legitimize their crimes.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.927
- Who is this kid?

21:00.960 --> 21:03.830
- Will Stein.
- What do we have on him?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.065
- Nothing.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.568
Everything I know
and what Carisi's told me,

21:08.601 --> 21:09.636
he's clean.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.938
- And anything we say
remains private.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.606
- Okay, so he did
say something to you,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.074
but you just refuse
to cooperate.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.576
That's what you're saying?

21:16.609 --> 21:17.777
- No--we--

21:17.810 --> 21:20.079
we go there to become better.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.881
And--and to become
better people.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.884
- Maybe you do, but Dalton
ain't gettin' any better.

21:24.917 --> 21:28.555
He's raped three women, Will.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.656
- I don't know anything
about that.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.491
- Do you know it's a crime
to lie to a police officer?

21:31.524 --> 21:32.559
You know that?

21:32.592 --> 21:34.594
- I didn't ask to be
a part of this.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.596
Okay, it's not my fault
that my father raped somebody

21:36.629 --> 21:38.097
and I inherited his genes.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.766
I'm just trying to do
the right thing

21:39.799 --> 21:41.501
and make sure
his evil never manifests.

21:41.534 --> 21:42.602
That's why I go
to these meetings.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.003
That's why I can control
my urges.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.738
- I feel for you, Will.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.740
But I'm a cop, all right?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.041
I'm not a priest,
I'm not a shrink.

21:49.075 --> 21:51.878
I want to talk about
actual crimes.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.947
So one more time,
are you gonna tell me anything

21:54.981 --> 21:56.616
about Sam Dalton or not?

21:56.649 --> 21:58.518
- No.

21:58.551 --> 22:02.121
[solemn music]

22:02.154 --> 22:04.891
- Let me know about Dalton.

22:04.924 --> 22:08.895
[door opens, closes]

22:08.928 --> 22:10.930
*

22:10.963 --> 22:15.735
- Sam, we have reliable evidence
that you assaulted three women.

22:15.768 --> 22:19.839
Robin Landry, Sara Perez,
Kim Espinoza.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.574
- Then why haven't you
arrested me?

22:21.608 --> 22:24.577
- Because we want to hear
your side of the story.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.013
Give you a chance
to explain yourself.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.515
Look, you're in
this therapy group.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.083
You're obviously remorseful.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.853
So maybe you want to come clean.

22:33.886 --> 22:38.591
Get all that guilt and shame
off your chest.

22:38.625 --> 22:39.959
- Like, confess?
- Yeah.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.662
- Well, you're going down
either way.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.598
That's a given.
But if you own up to it,

22:45.632 --> 22:47.767
you could redeem yourself
a little bit.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.736
- You know, the judge will take
that into account

22:49.769 --> 22:50.937
at your sentencing.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.939
- And who knows?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.641
Might make you feel good.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.075
- You know what would
make me feel good?

22:56.108 --> 22:57.176
- Hm?

22:57.209 --> 23:00.913
- A thick steak.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.682
- Well,
you're not alone in that.

23:02.715 --> 23:06.753
But, uh, I don't think that's
gonna happen for you right now.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.655
[tense music]

23:08.688 --> 23:10.089
- Where are you going?
- Home.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.092
- Yeah, that ship sailed.

23:13.125 --> 23:15.595
You're under arrest
for trespassing.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.096
- What?

23:17.129 --> 23:18.665
- You weren't allowed
to be in that warehouse.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.666
It's private property.
And we found

23:19.699 --> 23:20.733
that marijuana in your pocket.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.735
Turn around.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.971
- I want a lawyer.
- I'm sure you do.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.138
No problem.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.875
But first,
we're gonna get you processed.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.210
*

23:31.243 --> 23:34.614
- All three victims ID'd Dalton.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.783
They remembered his face,
his voice,

23:36.816 --> 23:39.118
and the stench of cheap cigars.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.687
- And they're all willing
to testify?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.854
- Oh, more like excited.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.723
They can't wait
to put this guy away.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.024
[phone chimes]

23:45.057 --> 23:46.826
More good news.

23:46.859 --> 23:50.730
The crime lab just confirmed
that Dalton's DNA is a match

23:50.763 --> 23:52.098
to all three vics.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.165
- You're too kind.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.702
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Hm?

23:57.770 --> 24:00.206
Motion to suppress.
- Suppress what?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.875
- Dalton's confession
to the therapy group.

24:02.909 --> 24:05.878
Defense claims
it's inadmissible.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.782
Clergymen-congregant privilege.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.251
- Clergymen-congregant?
That's a bit of a stretch.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.086
- Yeah, it is.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.755
But the law is evolving.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.758
- Okay, so worst case scenario,
we lose the motion.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.960
What does that mean?
- That means we're screwed.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.829
We lose that confession,
we lose everything else.

24:22.862 --> 24:25.197
Fruit of the poisonous tree.

24:31.070 --> 24:31.904
- My client grew up in
an abusive household.

24:32.839 --> 24:36.208
His father was a violent man
who struggled with

24:36.242 --> 24:38.578
drug addiction
and impulse control.

24:38.611 --> 24:42.048
He's currently serving
seven years in Greenhaven

24:42.081 --> 24:43.616
for sexual assault.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.718
Given Mr. Dalton's upbringing,

24:45.752 --> 24:48.220
he, too, had issues
with impulse control.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.290
But he was determined
to do something about it.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.960
To get help.
To develop the skills

24:53.993 --> 24:56.228
and tools necessary
to suppress these urges.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.697
- Your Honor, I'm not sure
how this is relevant

24:57.730 --> 24:59.231
to the defendant's motion.

24:59.265 --> 25:02.301
- Me neither.
Mr. Strauss?

25:02.334 --> 25:05.204
- I'm simply trying
to provide context.

25:05.237 --> 25:08.107
- For what?
- The therapy group

25:08.140 --> 25:13.279
where my client confessed,
as stated in my brief,

25:13.312 --> 25:15.682
these conversations
are inadmissible

25:15.715 --> 25:17.584
under the clergy-congregant
privilege

25:17.617 --> 25:19.752
and the establishment clause
of the First Amendment.

25:19.786 --> 25:21.220
- Guys in a warehouse
talking about women they raped

25:21.253 --> 25:23.155
or they want to rape is hardly
a religious experience.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.691
- The First Amendment of
the Constitution states that

25:24.724 --> 25:25.825
Congress shall make no law

25:25.858 --> 25:27.694
respecting the establishment...
- Yes, he confessed...

25:27.727 --> 25:29.328
- Or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.763
- To four men
in a carpet cleaning warehouse.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.999
- Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.

25:33.032 --> 25:36.769
- Four men and a minister.

25:36.803 --> 25:37.704
- Excuse me?

25:37.737 --> 25:40.272
- Richard Witt,
the founder of the group,

25:40.306 --> 25:42.108
is an ordained minister,
and a member

25:42.141 --> 25:44.110
of the Third Avenue
Baptist Church.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.713
- You're arguing
that this therapy group

25:46.746 --> 25:48.748
is a religious organization?

25:48.781 --> 25:51.150
- I'm arguing
it's a spiritual fellowship

25:51.183 --> 25:53.119
in the vein
of Alcoholics Anonymous,

25:53.152 --> 25:55.321
a group that both state
and federal courts

25:55.354 --> 25:58.825
have ruled is
a religious organization.

25:58.858 --> 26:02.161
- I presume you intend
to call Mr. Witt as a witness.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.763
- He's in the hallway.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.132
[tense music]

26:06.165 --> 26:08.735
- We begin each meeting
with the recitation

26:08.768 --> 26:10.236
of The Lord's Prayer.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.706
After that, they can say
or not say whatever they want.

26:13.740 --> 26:17.043
The goal is to give people
who believe they are prone

26:17.076 --> 26:20.847
to violent sexual impulses
a forum to discuss

26:20.880 --> 26:24.116
these complex
and shameful issues.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.719
- What is your role
in this organization?

26:26.753 --> 26:28.855
- I am the founder.

26:28.888 --> 26:34.326
- And do you have any background
in social work or psychology?

26:34.360 --> 26:36.228
- I'm a minister.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.898
- And how would you characterize

26:38.931 --> 26:42.735
the tone or the feeling

26:42.769 --> 26:44.136
of these meetings?

26:44.170 --> 26:46.673
- Spiritual.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.840
- Thank you.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.379
- What is your occupation?

26:53.412 --> 26:55.882
- I think of myself
as a man of God.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.249
- Huh.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.118
I think of you as
a private security guard

26:59.151 --> 27:01.854
who works at a topless
night club called Bunnies.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.923
- I work for
the security company.

27:03.956 --> 27:06.158
They tell me
where to report.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.393
- And this past month,
you've been reporting

27:07.426 --> 27:10.196
to a place called Bunnies.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.298
- Yes.
- And you derive 100%

27:12.331 --> 27:15.735
of your income from your work
as a private security guard.

27:15.768 --> 27:16.769
Correct?
- Yes.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.871
- So you preach for free?
- Yes.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.940
- So, it's a hobby.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.380
Some men play golf,
some collect wine.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.216
You preach.

27:30.249 --> 27:33.786
- I preach because I have
a desire to help others

27:33.820 --> 27:35.321
and I'm good at it.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.924
I was ordained at
the Church of our Holy Savior.

27:37.957 --> 27:41.861
- You mean the
ChurchofOurHolySavior.com.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.363
- That is correct.
But I studied--

27:44.396 --> 27:46.966
- Nothing further.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.769
- So now, talking about rape
in a warehouse

27:49.802 --> 27:51.403
is a religious meeting?

27:51.437 --> 27:53.405
- According to the judge, yeah.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.407
She ruled that the purpose
of the rape therapy group

27:55.441 --> 27:57.476
is akin to the purpose of AA.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.478
Help people overcome demons
and addictions.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.413
- So because they recite
the Lord's Prayer

28:01.447 --> 28:04.884
and Witt studied online
for all of two weeks,

28:04.917 --> 28:08.387
it's a religion and
the communication is privileged?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.189
- The truth is,
the judge got nervous.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.190
- [sighs]
- Look,

28:11.223 --> 28:12.759
it's a very complicated issue.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.194
And there's lots of case law.
- Hey.

28:15.227 --> 28:17.396
- The Cox case, in particular.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.266
If a murder confession
during an AA meeting

28:20.299 --> 28:22.769
can be considered privilege,
then why not a rape confession

28:22.802 --> 28:23.702
during a rape therapy group?

28:23.736 --> 28:26.906
- Well, if the confession
is inadmissible,

28:26.939 --> 28:28.908
what else is out?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.943
- Dalton's DNA.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.412
- What about the three victims?

28:33.445 --> 28:35.181
- They're out, too.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.449
If it weren't for Nick's
improper disclosure

28:37.483 --> 28:39.919
of Dalton's rape confession,
we never would have known

28:39.952 --> 28:42.755
who Dalton is
or what he looked like.

28:42.789 --> 28:46.225
So, the photo we showed
the victims is no good

28:46.258 --> 28:47.960
and their IDs are no good.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.329
[solemn music]

28:50.362 --> 28:53.800
- So we have nothing.
- Correct.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.768
- What about everybody else
in the therapy group?

28:55.802 --> 28:57.536
- Like I said, any communication
inside the group--

28:57.569 --> 28:59.972
- What about outside?

29:00.006 --> 29:01.473
- [sighs]

29:01.507 --> 29:03.009
If the conversation took place
away from Witt

29:03.042 --> 29:04.076
and the warehouse, we're good.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.812
But the problem is,
all these guys are tainted.

29:05.845 --> 29:08.280
- All except one.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.816
Will.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.784
He has no priors.

29:11.818 --> 29:14.486
DNA doesn't match
any outstanding rape kits.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.055
He has a great job,
and you saw him,

29:16.088 --> 29:18.925
he looks like an Eagle Scout.

29:18.958 --> 29:21.260
*

29:25.998 --> 29:27.934
- Hey, Will.
Hey, Will.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.269
Remember me?
- Yeah, um, hi.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.904
- Hi.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.373
- We met the other day.
- Everything okay?

29:34.406 --> 29:36.976
- Yeah, no, this is Allison.
Um, we work together.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.244
- Yeah, Will's helping us out
with something.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.578
He's a model citizen, this kid.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.913
- Yeah,
that's why we're here.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.281
We need some more help.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.851
So if you would excuse us
for just a moment.

29:44.884 --> 29:45.717
- Yeah, yeah.
- Are you okay?

29:45.751 --> 29:47.419
Do you need anything?
- It's all good.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.822
All good, thank you.
Don't worry.

29:49.856 --> 29:53.392
Um, I work here.
And I can't have people thinking

29:53.425 --> 29:55.361
that I'm some--
- They don't.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.496
'Cause you're not.
- Okay.

29:57.529 --> 29:59.832
- Okay, so...
- Okay, yeah.

29:59.866 --> 30:03.369
- Did you ever talk to Dalton
outside of the therapy meetings?

30:03.402 --> 30:04.971
- I just don't want to
betray anybody.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.038
- Okay, listen to me.

30:06.072 --> 30:09.308
You don't owe Dalton
a damn thing.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.542
He's a predator.

30:10.576 --> 30:13.946
He's everything that you're
working so hard not to become.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.283
But if you protect him,
then he's gonna do it again.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.986
- Yeah.
- And that rape--

30:20.019 --> 30:22.521
that rape's gonna
be on you, Will.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.962
- We had coffee once,
at a diner.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.965
- Did he say anything
about his victims?

30:32.999 --> 30:35.567
- He said the victims enjoy it.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.636
That they don't scream
and they don't fight back.

30:37.669 --> 30:41.607
And I wanted to punch him
in the face.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.409
But I didn't.

30:43.442 --> 30:47.413
But he's really scary,
and I'm--I'm not that tough.

30:47.446 --> 30:52.051
So I didn't, but I really,
really wanted to.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.987
- Dalton told you
that he raped three women?

30:57.924 --> 30:59.058
- That's correct.

30:59.091 --> 30:59.858
- And there was
no one else present?

30:59.892 --> 31:02.962
No ministers?
No group members?

31:02.995 --> 31:05.364
- No, it was just the two of us.

31:05.397 --> 31:09.368
*

31:09.401 --> 31:10.937
- Call the three victims.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.538
- And tell them what?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.073
- The case is back on,
and they're testifying

31:14.106 --> 31:15.374
first thing tomorrow.

31:15.407 --> 31:17.076
- So Will's testimony is enough?

31:17.109 --> 31:18.610
- Dalton's coffee shop
confession to Will

31:18.644 --> 31:19.578
is admissible.

31:19.611 --> 31:20.746
There's no religious privilege
whatsoever,

31:20.779 --> 31:24.050
so we can ask the victims
to ID Dalton based off this.

31:24.083 --> 31:26.953
- Thank you, Carisi.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.188
I really appreciate
your help, Will.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.090
You just saved our case.

31:38.364 --> 31:38.630
.

31:38.664 --> 31:39.265
- Sam Dalton raped three women.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.401
Sara Perez,

31:42.434 --> 31:45.037
Robin Landry,

31:45.071 --> 31:48.074
Kim Espinoza.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.276
The evidence is overwhelming.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.712
Each of these three victims
will describe the brutality

31:53.745 --> 31:56.015
this man inflicted upon them.

31:56.048 --> 31:59.185
The defendant is a violent
and impulsive predator.

31:59.218 --> 32:03.089
His semen was found inside or on
each of the three victims.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.391
There is no question
he is responsible

32:05.424 --> 32:07.393
for attacking these three women.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.128
But don't take my word,

32:09.161 --> 32:12.598
or the victim's word,
or the crime lab's.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.001
Take his word.

32:15.034 --> 32:19.271
The defendant confessed
to attacking these women.

32:19.305 --> 32:23.142
Sam Dalton is
a dangerous predator

32:23.175 --> 32:26.979
who deserves to be punished
to the full extent of the law.

32:27.013 --> 32:28.647
[tense music]

32:28.680 --> 32:31.750
And after he put
the wool socks in your mouth,

32:31.783 --> 32:32.718
what did he do?

32:32.751 --> 32:36.755
- He put an ice pick
near my neck and then...

32:36.788 --> 32:38.290
he raped me.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.726
- Do you see the man who did
that to you here today?

32:40.759 --> 32:43.295
- Yes, he's right there.

32:43.329 --> 32:47.299
*

32:47.333 --> 32:49.001
- If that's true,
then you couldn't have seen

32:49.035 --> 32:50.769
Mr. Dalton's face.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.173
- No, I-I saw his face
before he attacked me.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.775
- But you told the police,

32:56.808 --> 33:01.647
"He pushed me down
on the floor within seconds."

33:01.680 --> 33:03.082
- Right.

33:03.115 --> 33:05.684
- So, nine months ago,
a man pushes you down

33:05.717 --> 33:08.687
on the floor within seconds
of seeing him--in the dark--

33:08.720 --> 33:12.191
yet you remember his face
so vividly

33:12.224 --> 33:15.427
you can confidently identify
him in a court of law?

33:15.461 --> 33:17.063
- Yes.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.764
- You either have
the best memory

33:18.797 --> 33:20.332
in the history of the world

33:20.366 --> 33:22.801
or you are a liar.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.136
- Objection.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.472
*

33:26.505 --> 33:28.407
- Withdrawn.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.110
*

33:31.143 --> 33:33.145
32 minutes after the attack,

33:33.179 --> 33:35.147
you told the police
the assailant

33:35.181 --> 33:39.285
was 5'8" tall.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.287
Yeah.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.323
190 pounds, had blue eyes

33:44.356 --> 33:48.194
and a crooked nose.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.197
But as you can see,
that description does not fit--

33:51.230 --> 33:56.102
I mean, does not remotely fit
Sam Dalton.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.537
- Uh--I'm not very good
at describing people.

33:58.570 --> 34:03.375
But I'm certain that he--
Sam Dalton--raped me.

34:03.409 --> 34:05.444
- Right, just like you were
certain when you gave the police

34:05.477 --> 34:09.548
a faulty description
of the assailant.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.217
The night of the attack,

34:11.250 --> 34:13.519
you told the police
you were drinking.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.556
You had four glasses
of wine.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.125
- Yes.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.560
- So you were drunk?

34:21.593 --> 34:23.729
- I had four glasses of wine.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.198
- Which means
you were intoxicated.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.467
- Which means I had
four glasses of wine.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.369
- Exactly.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.305
Nothing further.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.541
- Mr. Barba, will you please
call your next witness?

34:35.574 --> 34:38.544
- Yes, Your Honor.
The people call Will Stein.

34:38.577 --> 34:45.784
*

34:46.852 --> 34:47.819
At this time, Your Honor,

34:47.853 --> 34:49.821
the people call for a recess.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.591
- Court adjourned.
[bangs gavel]

34:52.624 --> 34:53.792
*

34:53.825 --> 34:54.693
- Oh.
Where is he?

34:54.726 --> 34:56.328
- I keep calling him.
He's not picking up.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.230
- Went by his workplace,
his receptionist

34:58.264 --> 34:59.498
said that he didn't even
show up today

34:59.531 --> 35:01.200
and he wasn't
at his apartment, either.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.169
- Well, you need to find him,
fast, 'cause without him,

35:03.202 --> 35:04.503
we don't have a case.
- We understand.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.439
- I don't care if you
understand, just find him now.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.540
- You know what,
we're gonna find this kid.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.376
But don't you hang this on us.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.311
You lost that motion
to suppress, not me.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.212
- This again, Carisi?
- I showed you a case

35:13.245 --> 35:14.413
with precedent that was
directly on point.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.382
- It was a Delaware case.
- That white supremacy group--

35:16.415 --> 35:18.517
- Was not applicable.
- Well, that's your opinion.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.518
And that worked out
great for us.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.188
- Come on, Sonny, let's go.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.190
*

35:24.223 --> 35:25.391
Hey, what the hell
was all that about?

35:25.424 --> 35:26.392
- It was nothing.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.560
- It didn't sound like nothing.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.231
- Listen, Amanda,
I don't care about Barba.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.299
All right,
but I gave him a good case.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.401
It would've kept the original
confession alive.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.835
And we wouldn't be in this
position right now,

35:36.868 --> 35:38.270
where a rapist is about to walk.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.372
- Okay, Sonny, all right,
I hear you.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.474
But we are where
we are now, so--

35:42.508 --> 35:43.642
- What about Will's friend,
Allison?

35:43.675 --> 35:45.844
- I called her,
she has no idea where he is.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.479
But what about
the preacher, Witt?

35:47.513 --> 35:49.281
Right?
He and Will seemed close.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.450
- Yeah.
That's a good idea.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.419
- I talked to Will last night.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.554
I told him not to testify.

35:55.587 --> 35:58.590
- [laughs]
Are you out of your mind?

35:58.624 --> 36:00.426
You know,
that's witness tampering.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.428
- I'm trying to help him.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.264
He needs the group.
Which means he shouldn't--

36:05.297 --> 36:06.965
he can't--betray it.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.534
Without us,
he has nowhere to go

36:08.567 --> 36:12.204
and he will eventually fall prey
to his predilections.

36:12.238 --> 36:14.440
- If he needs help,
he'll find a real minister,

36:14.473 --> 36:16.275
he'll find a real shrink.
- You know what, enough of this.

36:16.308 --> 36:17.976
Let's talk about Sam Dalton.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.246
That son of a bitch assaulted--

36:20.279 --> 36:22.914
terrorized three women,
all right?

36:22.948 --> 36:24.583
So whether or not you think
it's genetics,

36:24.616 --> 36:25.984
he needs to be punished.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.454
And that means we need
Will to testify

36:28.487 --> 36:31.423
regardless of his predilections.

36:31.457 --> 36:33.959
Okay, so you're gonna tell us
where Will is right now.

36:33.992 --> 36:37.363
- I don't know where he is.
- Then call him and find out.

36:37.396 --> 36:43.369
*

36:43.402 --> 36:47.473
- I did everything right.
I work hard and I pray.

36:47.506 --> 36:48.940
But no matter what,
the truth comes out

36:48.974 --> 36:50.709
and everything reverts back
to the mean.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.612
And my mean is that
I'm supposed to be a rapist.

36:53.645 --> 36:54.780
So--if I'm just a good person--

36:54.813 --> 36:57.949
if--if I'm truly a good person,
I'm just gonna kill myself

36:57.983 --> 36:59.585
before I hurt
some innocent woman.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.253
- It's okay, okay?
Just take it easy.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.289
Like you said,
you're doing everything right.

37:03.322 --> 37:06.392
- I'm 25 years old
and I've never kissed a girl.

37:06.425 --> 37:09.261
'Cause I'm afraid of
what I might do to her.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.429
What might happen.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.564
So...

37:12.598 --> 37:15.567
so I just do what Mr. Witt says
and I, uh...

37:15.601 --> 37:17.636
I just--I just suppress my urges

37:17.669 --> 37:20.672
and I-I avoid getting intimate
with women.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.941
- Yes, but you ask me,
you avoid Mr. Witt.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.011
He is trying to help you,
but he's not equipped

37:26.044 --> 37:28.013
to deal with these issues.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.715
- But that's the thing
that nobody is,

37:29.748 --> 37:32.651
'cause it's not an issue,
it's a gene.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.421
*

37:35.454 --> 37:36.955
You can't help it
when it's a gene, right?

37:36.988 --> 37:42.661
If you got a cancer gene
or people have schizophrenia.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.631
It's not a matter about time,
it's about--it's about when.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.734
- Will, Will, listen to me.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.669
Listen to me.

37:50.702 --> 37:54.706
There's no such thing
as a rape gene.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.742
There just isn't.
You got to trust me on that.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.778
I know, because I've done
the research on this.

37:59.811 --> 38:03.081
I've talked to doctors.
I've talked to psychiatrists.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.384
- Why?
Why?

38:05.417 --> 38:07.753
- Because I'm like you.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.555
- What do you mean
you're like me?

38:09.588 --> 38:14.460
- My father was a rapist.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.995
So I know this one.

38:17.028 --> 38:20.432
I've been dealing with it
for my whole life.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.801
But that doesn't make me bad.

38:22.834 --> 38:26.372
That doesn't make me evil.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.774
*

38:28.807 --> 38:31.009
- Listen, Will, when the guys
in your group therapy--

38:31.042 --> 38:32.344
when they tell stories
about rape,

38:32.378 --> 38:35.614
how does that make you feel?

38:35.647 --> 38:37.716
- It's absolutely disgusting.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.084
- Exactly.

38:39.117 --> 38:40.986
It repulses you.

38:41.019 --> 38:46.825
It repulses you because
you are not a rapist, Will.

38:46.858 --> 38:53.599
*

38:53.632 --> 38:54.633
- Hey, come on.
- [grunting]

38:54.666 --> 38:57.503
- I got you
I got you.

38:57.536 --> 39:00.572
It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay, I got you.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.107
- [sighs]

39:05.444 --> 39:09.848
- We were having coffee,
and Sam Dalton

39:09.881 --> 39:14.486
told me that it was okay to
assault women--to rape them--

39:14.520 --> 39:17.523
as long as you prayed
for forgiveness afterward.

39:17.556 --> 39:19.157
- What did you say in response?

39:19.190 --> 39:22.093
- I told him he was wrong.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.631
And--and that raping somebody
is horrible.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.165
*

39:27.198 --> 39:32.804
And he just smiled at me
and said I didn't get it.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.673
That the women
actually enjoy it.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.808
- Did he tell you how many women
he'd assaulted?

39:36.842 --> 39:38.143
- Yes.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.779
He said he raped three women.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.148
*

39:43.181 --> 39:46.184
- Right now, do you see
the man you spoke to

39:46.217 --> 39:51.189
in that coffee shop who told you
that he raped three women?

39:51.222 --> 39:56.895
*

39:56.928 --> 40:00.131
- Yes.

40:00.165 --> 40:02.200
That's him.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.869
Sam Dalton.

40:03.902 --> 40:11.109
*

40:19.585 --> 40:21.787
- It's a hell of a thing,
thinking that you're destined

40:21.820 --> 40:22.821
to be a rapist,

40:22.854 --> 40:26.592
that every normal,

40:26.625 --> 40:29.595
healthy urge is a warning.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.096
[phone buzzing]

40:31.129 --> 40:34.800
An omen that something bad
is to come.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.134
Hello?

40:40.506 --> 40:43.475
Oh, okay.

40:43.509 --> 40:45.677
All right.
Yes.

40:45.711 --> 40:48.680
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much for calling.

40:48.714 --> 40:49.681
- Everything all right?

40:49.715 --> 40:51.683
- [sighs]
Yeah, it's...

40:51.717 --> 40:52.851
it was Noah's school.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.720
He fell, playing tag.

40:54.753 --> 40:58.156
He cut his knee.
It's--it's no big deal.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.725
- Just like pushing a kid
in a sandbox.

40:59.758 --> 41:02.260
- [sighs]

41:02.293 --> 41:04.262
I hope you're right.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.964
- I am.

41:12.771 --> 41:15.674
- Hi, Mommy.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.743
- Hey.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.748
You still awake?

41:22.781 --> 41:23.815
- Mm.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.522
- Good night, Noah.

41:30.556 --> 41:32.591
I love you.

41:34.926 --> 41:38.797
I'm always gonna love you,
no matter what.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.866
No matter what.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.804
Close your eyes.
[smooches]

41:47.839 --> 41:49.875
Good night, sweet boy.
