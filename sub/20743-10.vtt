20:03.244 --> 20:05.256
You know what I mean?

20:05.290 --> 20:07.256
She uses muscle.

20:07.282 --> 20:09.817
She's not a <i> sicario.</i> She's a <i> cerebro.</i>

20:12.350 --> 20:14.598
Somebody else was here, too.

20:19.902 --> 20:21.472
Hi, guys.

20:22.181 --> 20:23.965
Hi, everyone.

20:23.991 --> 20:25.318
Oh, look. There's my old desk.

20:25.344 --> 20:27.428
Daniel, you're not even supposed to be here.

20:27.454 --> 20:29.305
Didn't Cuevas put a
restraining order on you?

20:29.331 --> 20:30.886
That's a pussy move.

20:31.638 --> 20:34.757
Anyone want to call the cops?
You guys? Go ahead, call them.

20:37.254 --> 20:39.996
- Have you been going to meetings?
- No.

20:40.779 --> 20:42.229
Are you still my partner?

20:42.509 --> 20:45.066
It's kind of hard to be when you're
not working for the paper.

20:45.092 --> 20:48.543
I'm not talking about the paper.
I'm talking about you, me and the story.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.334
What are you really asking me?

20:51.402 --> 20:53.510
- Do you have something new?
- Yes.

20:53.602 --> 20:56.172
Red Ridge. Shooting. It's big.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.487
It's not about the <i> El Paso Times.</i>
It's about us.

21:00.156 --> 21:03.546
And I need to know if you're in or out.

21:06.684 --> 21:08.685
I'm in.

21:27.265 --> 21:29.483
- Doc?
- Yeah.

21:39.293 --> 21:40.994
What happened?

21:41.156 --> 21:42.488
Riding accident.

21:42.514 --> 21:44.293
Yeah, I'll buy that.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.631
Okay, let's get her inside
before she bleeds out.

21:56.977 --> 21:59.379
MONTE: How is it?

21:59.446 --> 22:01.714
ORTON: It's through and through.

22:01.782 --> 22:03.816
She lost a lot of blood.

22:03.884 --> 22:06.319
Doesn't seem to be organ damage.
She'll live.

22:06.387 --> 22:08.554
Too bad for her.

22:08.622 --> 22:10.290
You'll wire the money into my account?

22:10.357 --> 22:13.493
Throw in a pair of custom boots
if you keep her from dying.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.483
- Should I even ask who this is?
- Nope.

22:17.567 --> 22:19.484
(sighs)

22:19.510 --> 22:22.111
I don't know why I ask that shit anymore.

22:24.672 --> 22:26.055
(sighs)

22:41.739 --> 22:43.773
Gross! Mom!

22:43.857 --> 22:44.941
What is it, honey?

22:45.025 --> 22:46.826
GIRL: He stuck his fat finger in my ear!

22:54.585 --> 22:56.336
(kids screaming)

23:00.274 --> 23:02.258
(siren whoops)

23:20.894 --> 23:22.812
Sir?

23:23.426 --> 23:25.794
We need you to step out of the vehicle.

23:27.234 --> 23:29.235
Now, sir.

23:39.373 --> 23:42.008
Holy shit.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.974
There you are.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.226
- Welcome back.
- (panting)

23:57.261 --> 23:58.427
Where am I?

23:58.512 --> 24:00.146
You're on Earth.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.014
You're gonna have to watch for infection.

24:02.099 --> 24:03.933
(groans softly)

24:04.017 --> 24:05.184
(panting)

24:05.269 --> 24:07.837
Very interesting tattoos
you have there, miss.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.188
Very disturbing. (chuckles)

24:09.273 --> 24:12.975
(groans softly)

24:13.043 --> 24:15.553
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey! Easy, easy. Ooh.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.779
Don't touch me.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.114
All right, no touching. Got it.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.665
You're gonna have to take it easy.

24:19.757 --> 24:21.955
- You lost a lot of blood. You got to...
- I'm fine!

24:23.890 --> 24:25.668
Doc?

24:33.230 --> 24:35.831
You got to be shitting me.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.938
This is gonna cost you.

24:42.450 --> 24:44.097
MONTE: I know you could use it.

24:44.123 --> 24:46.083
Mind if I have a look-see here, Officer?

24:46.364 --> 24:48.243
Why did you bring him back here?

24:48.368 --> 24:49.969
- He had the ledger.
- Where is it?

24:50.020 --> 24:51.554
I don't know. He hid it.

24:51.638 --> 24:54.407
I had to get out of there.
The <i> policía</i> was coming.

24:54.475 --> 24:56.209
Can you fix him? I need to talk to him.

24:56.553 --> 25:00.153
Eleanor, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

25:00.179 --> 25:01.713
He <i> is</i> the law.

25:01.780 --> 25:05.350
I don't care about your ideas, Mr. Flagman.

25:05.376 --> 25:07.292
Okay, Doc?

25:07.318 --> 25:09.954
- I'll see what I can do.
- ELEANOR: No.

25:10.022 --> 25:12.056
You have to do better than that.

25:19.465 --> 25:21.466
Hey, hey, hey.

25:21.533 --> 25:23.635
I'm glad that you're feeling better,
ma'am, I really am,

25:23.702 --> 25:25.903
but back up a little bit.

25:25.971 --> 25:29.340
This isn't a goddamn teaching hospital.

25:29.408 --> 25:31.476
Well?

25:31.560 --> 25:33.544
He got it a lot worse than you did.

25:33.612 --> 25:35.079
- Will he die?
- Oh, probably.

25:35.147 --> 25:37.348
See if I can stabilize him.

25:39.285 --> 25:41.219
Any word from Jaime?

25:41.245 --> 25:44.097
- He'll be here.
- How long does it take to dump bodies?

25:44.123 --> 25:45.823
I can't be here when he wakes up.

25:45.891 --> 25:47.262
Why not?

25:47.288 --> 25:50.028
I'm just the facilitator. You know that.

25:50.095 --> 25:52.452
Do you have a way for us
to get back to Juárez?

25:52.478 --> 25:55.933
Let me work on that. Good luck, Miss Nacht.

26:20.359 --> 26:21.859
(sniffles, sighs)

26:22.617 --> 26:24.868
(panting)

26:24.894 --> 26:26.645
Hank's not here.

26:32.538 --> 26:34.539
(sighs)

26:42.598 --> 26:44.916
SONYA: Any idea how
she'd be caught up in this?

26:44.983 --> 26:47.885
She tried to tell me once.

26:47.936 --> 26:50.521
Didn't want to know, I told her.

26:50.556 --> 26:53.474
I just didn't believe
she was in real danger.

26:53.559 --> 26:54.892
You know, just...

26:54.918 --> 26:56.074
(sighs)

26:56.100 --> 26:57.350
Driver seems off.

26:57.376 --> 26:59.916
- Not sure he speaks English.
- Where is he?

27:01.066 --> 27:03.735
(Marco sighs, speaks Spanish)

27:07.623 --> 27:09.249
Hey.

27:23.505 --> 27:25.506
(speaks Spanish)

27:31.571 --> 27:33.705
Jaime, right?

27:35.972 --> 27:39.308
You help Eleanor sometimes with jobs?

27:42.941 --> 27:46.644
That candy in the house... was that yours?

27:49.114 --> 27:51.115
Yeah?

27:52.576 --> 27:54.778
Do you know where she is now?

28:04.362 --> 28:07.131
Do you know where you're
supposed to go next?

28:10.185 --> 28:12.170
FRYE: <i> Come on,</i> <i>we got narco in El Paso.</i>

28:12.237 --> 28:14.972
You got blood on the sidewalk.
How many bodies you got inside?

28:15.023 --> 28:17.475
You two can't be here. That's the last time

28:17.526 --> 28:19.767
- I'm gonna tell you. - Come on, Coop.
Give us something, man.

28:19.778 --> 28:22.063
I'm gonna give you a boot
in your ass if you don't get

28:22.147 --> 28:23.563
off my crime scene.

28:23.589 --> 28:25.290
Ain't it happy hour somewhere?

28:28.487 --> 28:30.488
(scoffs)

28:31.933 --> 28:33.884
Who's that guy?

28:33.910 --> 28:35.529
It's an agency, right?

28:35.555 --> 28:38.384
Yeah, but it's not local and not DEA.

28:38.410 --> 28:39.493
CIA?

28:39.519 --> 28:40.936
That dude is plugged in.

28:40.962 --> 28:42.462
So we follow him?

28:42.488 --> 28:44.205
Hell, yes, we follow him.

28:44.231 --> 28:46.232
Come on, go, go, go, go.

28:47.925 --> 28:50.981
Okay. He's not gonna die, either.
I'm out of here.

28:51.007 --> 28:52.641
Wake him up.

28:53.479 --> 28:56.113
I can't do that. It will kill him.

28:56.181 --> 28:57.431
Eventually.

28:57.516 --> 28:59.826
- I think we're splitting hairs here.
- Do it!

29:01.049 --> 29:03.117
Now.

29:08.193 --> 29:10.294
Okay.

29:10.362 --> 29:13.264
I know you're all eager to
chat with him and everything,

29:13.332 --> 29:16.534
but I'm telling you, lady, this...

29:16.618 --> 29:19.203
- (gasps)
- You talk too much!

29:19.271 --> 29:21.639
Put this in him, or I'll put it in you.

29:21.707 --> 29:23.624
Your choice.

29:23.709 --> 29:25.259
Do it.

29:25.344 --> 29:28.045
Okay, okay, okay.

29:28.096 --> 29:30.097
Okay.

29:33.502 --> 29:35.402
Okay.

29:37.356 --> 29:39.724
Okay.

30:03.345 --> 30:06.408
Wake up. Wake up!

30:08.984 --> 30:10.918
(gasping)

30:10.986 --> 30:12.870
(snorting)

30:16.325 --> 30:18.259
You have something of mine.

30:18.327 --> 30:20.461
Where is it?

30:21.630 --> 30:23.631
Go to hell.

30:24.666 --> 30:26.667
We're already there.

30:32.174 --> 30:33.541
(groaning) Where's my ledger?

30:36.345 --> 30:37.345
Where's my ledger?!

30:37.412 --> 30:38.679
(screams)

30:46.996 --> 30:50.015
DISPATCHER: <i>Available units responding,</i>
<i>Creighton Power and Gas.</i>

30:50.083 --> 30:51.666
Copy.

30:51.751 --> 30:54.553
We'll be first on scene.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.755
What do you think happened at that house?

30:56.823 --> 31:00.225
Some of those bodies in the truck...

31:00.293 --> 31:02.472
they were Fausto's men.

31:02.498 --> 31:04.599
How do you know?

31:04.625 --> 31:06.626
I know.

31:07.480 --> 31:11.770
Tell me exactly what the DEA told
you was happening at this meeting.

31:11.854 --> 31:13.538
Joe said Red Ridge

31:13.606 --> 31:15.774
was part of Fausto's laundering operation.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.029
He thought the CIA knew, too.

31:22.776 --> 31:24.377
She betrayed him.

31:24.631 --> 31:27.086
Eleanor betrayed Fausto.

31:27.496 --> 31:28.931
For Sebastian.

31:28.957 --> 31:30.925
And Fausto hit back.

32:16.798 --> 32:17.898
What do we know?

32:17.966 --> 32:19.590
- Shit.
- No shit.

32:19.616 --> 32:21.183
Copy on the no shit.

32:21.209 --> 32:22.957
Were you aware of this meeting?

32:22.983 --> 32:24.845
This sale? Whatever it was?

32:24.871 --> 32:26.315
I was.

32:26.341 --> 32:28.075
Didn't anticipate the DEA wrinkle.

32:28.143 --> 32:31.479
How about narco gunmen murdering
Americans on U.S. soil?

32:31.546 --> 32:34.547
Truckloads of bodies in parking lots?

32:34.683 --> 32:37.885
Yeah, my crystal ball
broke last Tuesday, Carla.

32:40.188 --> 32:42.123
Tell me if I have this right.

32:42.190 --> 32:44.625
And keep in mind,
I'm very close to ending your career.

32:44.651 --> 32:46.660
In a diner with horseshoes on the walls.

32:46.686 --> 32:49.679
- Go ahead.
- The DEA gets kicked out of Mexico.

32:49.705 --> 32:52.016
You increase your activities.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.836
One month later,
I have an actual blood house in El Paso.

32:55.904 --> 32:58.539
You imply causality where
there is none, ma'am.

32:58.887 --> 33:00.964
A butterfly takes a dump in Milwaukee.

33:00.990 --> 33:02.518
We lose control of Juárez.

33:02.544 --> 33:03.544
That's your theory?

33:05.313 --> 33:07.782
I thought we were here to discuss the, uh,

33:07.849 --> 33:10.851
management options in the
wake of Fausto's fall.

33:10.919 --> 33:13.037
He hasn't fallen yet.

33:13.063 --> 33:14.709
- He will.
- You keep saying that.

33:14.735 --> 33:16.203
The net is far and wide.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.694
Who's your man to replace Galvan?

33:20.762 --> 33:21.862
These four...

33:21.930 --> 33:24.799
lieutenants in Galvan's organization.

33:24.883 --> 33:26.734
They've each abandoned him

33:26.802 --> 33:28.035
in the last 72 hours.

33:28.103 --> 33:29.103
Take your pick.

33:30.338 --> 33:32.006
They're killers, they're smart,

33:32.073 --> 33:33.574
they can be what you want them to be.

33:33.642 --> 33:35.709
I think your best bet is Sentenza.

33:35.777 --> 33:38.679
The most controllable.

33:38.747 --> 33:40.347
You said the same about Fausto.

33:41.374 --> 33:44.007
- I was young then.
- Not that young.

33:46.054 --> 33:48.155
This Sentenza's your man then?

33:48.223 --> 33:50.491
Put a gun to my head, yeah.

33:50.559 --> 33:53.561
He's got his quirks, but then we all do.

33:56.248 --> 33:57.364
Fine.

33:57.432 --> 33:59.033
Make it happen then.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.635
Fix it.

34:04.175 --> 34:07.558
Shit just got legit. You know who that is?

34:07.642 --> 34:09.092
No.

34:09.177 --> 34:12.146
Neither do I, but she looks like a boss.

34:14.014 --> 34:16.550
ADRIANA: Who's that guy she was talking to?

34:16.618 --> 34:19.018
I'm betting that's the
guy who knows everything.

34:19.087 --> 34:21.822
I'll take the waffles.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.591
Dry.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.498
(chuckles)

34:59.891 --> 35:01.896
(crying)

35:23.726 --> 35:25.827
(crying)

35:32.494 --> 35:34.478
(panting rapidly)

35:41.932 --> 35:43.966
Pretty.

35:50.111 --> 35:51.645
(crying)

36:05.507 --> 36:07.736
(whimpers)

36:09.713 --> 36:11.730
(crying)

36:15.680 --> 36:17.029
(gun clicks)

36:17.055 --> 36:18.472
(gasps)

36:18.523 --> 36:22.042
(sobbing)

36:41.463 --> 36:43.464
(tires screeching)

36:45.084 --> 36:46.284
I hear the doctor leaving.

36:46.369 --> 36:47.952
Monte trusts him. Let him go.

36:48.037 --> 36:50.038
(panting)

36:52.808 --> 36:54.609
Just kill me now.

36:54.677 --> 36:56.945
I ain't gonna tell you. We both know that.

36:57.847 --> 36:59.982
Get me his wallet.

37:07.288 --> 37:09.690
We will go to his house
and torture his wife.

37:09.716 --> 37:11.368
Put him in the car.

37:11.394 --> 37:12.977
Goddamn you.

37:13.062 --> 37:15.063
(grunting)

37:18.117 --> 37:20.135
(whispers): You don't have to do this.

37:21.904 --> 37:24.372
Miss Eleanor, listen, we need to leave.

37:24.407 --> 37:26.208
We can't go to his house...
it's too dangerous.

37:26.242 --> 37:28.777
Do you love your children, Cesar?

37:29.812 --> 37:31.329
What do you think?

37:31.414 --> 37:33.415
Put him in the car.

37:39.171 --> 37:41.172
(tires screeching)

37:43.309 --> 37:44.426
One driver.

38:08.834 --> 38:09.868
It's her.

38:12.588 --> 38:13.204
Hold on.

38:21.514 --> 38:22.547
(grunts)

38:22.631 --> 38:24.632
(tires screech)

38:28.804 --> 38:30.805
(steam hissing)

38:46.539 --> 38:47.822
Stop.

38:48.874 --> 38:50.825
(panting): Stop.

38:52.328 --> 38:55.330
I said stop.

39:03.556 --> 39:05.557
Get down on the ground.
