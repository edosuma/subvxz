WEBVTT

00:01.141 --> 00:02.108
What are you doing?

00:02.142 --> 00:03.776
You haven't been exclusive?

00:03.811 --> 00:06.979
I'm not the kind of girl who's going
to have an ordinary relationship.

00:07.014 --> 00:09.716
- Love doesn't work!
- Because you're heartless.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.617
- We found out she slept with Beaver.
- That piece of crap?

00:11.652 --> 00:14.153
- Rebecca didn't think so.
- Evan, what the hell?!

00:14.188 --> 00:17.857
Dana gives me something more.
She inspires me.

00:17.891 --> 00:20.226
Cappie and I aren't built to last.

00:20.260 --> 00:22.795
We work here, in college,

00:22.830 --> 00:24.597
and I don't think we'll
work anywhere else.

00:24.631 --> 00:26.332
What abo graduation in May?

00:26.367 --> 00:27.867
We'll worry about that in May.

00:31.405 --> 00:33.272
Noonan! - You're gonna miss it,
Noonan. Miss it.

00:33.307 --> 00:35.308
- Miss it, Noonan.
- Noonan!

00:35.342 --> 00:36.809
Oh!

00:40.714 --> 00:43.349
Hey, guys. Cap, this is Dana.

00:43.384 --> 00:45.017
Well, hello there, Dana.

00:45.052 --> 00:47.019
We'll take three boxes of Samoas,

00:47.054 --> 00:49.889
- four boxes of Thin Mints...
- I'm not a Girl Scout.

00:49.923 --> 00:52.191
- This is my girlfriend.
- Can she get us cookies?

00:52.226 --> 00:56.362
These are my pledges,
the future of the KT house.

00:56.397 --> 00:58.297
- Really?
- Anthony Hopkins.

00:58.332 --> 00:59.999
They've done a lot of crazy stuff,

01:00.033 --> 01:02.235
like, uh... What
have you guys done?

01:02.269 --> 01:04.437
Were we supposed to do anything?

01:04.471 --> 01:05.872
When Spitter was a pledge,

01:05.906 --> 01:08.574
he stole a top-secret
weather thingie.

01:08.609 --> 01:12.845
The Remington-Herzog Atmospheric
Destabilizer? That was you?

01:12.880 --> 01:14.580
That's how I made
Vesuvius rain beer.

01:14.615 --> 01:16.883
And then we put some farm
animals in Omega Chi,

01:16.917 --> 01:20.720
and we took over the KT house,
locking out the actives.

01:20.754 --> 01:22.655
Uh, that sounds like a lot of work.

01:22.689 --> 01:25.191
OK, you need to step it
up and make your mark,

01:25.225 --> 01:26.926
or else no one will
remember you here.

01:26.960 --> 01:30.062
Why do some of you guys have OXs?
I thought you were KTs?

01:30.097 --> 01:32.398
I like my practice conditions
to be as real as possible.

01:32.433 --> 01:34.600
Tomorrow's the IFC Greek
Gods of Golf Tourney,

01:34.635 --> 01:36.836
where I will smite Evan Chambers.

01:36.870 --> 01:38.371
Golf is just the beginning

01:38.405 --> 01:42.241
of your secret master plan,
right, Cap? - Absolutely.

01:42.276 --> 01:46.212
To lure them into my master trap,
I have master bait.

01:46.246 --> 01:48.247
- Yeah?
- All in good time, Spitter.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.582
That's on a need-to-know basis,

01:49.616 --> 01:51.617
and right now you don't
need to know. - I get it.

01:51.652 --> 01:54.454
You can't talk about your big secret
plan in front of me because I'm a girl?

01:54.488 --> 01:56.989
No. It's 'cause you didn't
bring me any Thin Mints.

01:59.860 --> 02:02.562
So now that he's gone,
what's your big secret plan?

02:02.596 --> 02:05.698
- I wish I knew.
- You guys are good.

02:07.835 --> 02:10.703
God, we only have six
weeks left at CRU

02:10.737 --> 02:12.305
and in the ZBZ house.

02:12.339 --> 02:15.441
I know. We're about to experience
a lot of lasts together,

02:15.476 --> 02:18.044
like a last Spring Break
and a last finals.

02:18.078 --> 02:21.447
Mm-hmm. - Our last 10:
15am on March 10th.

02:21.482 --> 02:23.749
Our last 10:16.

02:23.784 --> 02:26.085
Maybe my last six
weeks with Cappie?

02:26.119 --> 02:28.054
Oh. Right. Sorry.

02:28.088 --> 02:31.057
That's the last of the lasts.

02:31.091 --> 02:34.627
- When did Rebecca get back?
- Oh, last night.

02:34.661 --> 02:36.295
And not to bring up lasts again,

02:36.330 --> 02:38.631
but this very well could
be your last chance

02:38.665 --> 02:40.700
to be there for Rebecca
as her big sis.

02:40.734 --> 02:42.935
Looks like she's pretty upset
that Evan broke up with her.

02:42.970 --> 02:46.439
Or maybe she's fine.

02:46.473 --> 02:48.474
Fine? A few days in Jackson Hole

02:48.509 --> 02:50.743
and suddenly everything is fine?

02:51.945 --> 02:54.413
Uh... Hey, Rebecca.

02:54.448 --> 02:56.949
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

02:56.984 --> 03:00.820
Um... if you need to talk,
your big sis is here.

03:00.854 --> 03:02.755
- For you.
- No, thanks.

03:02.789 --> 03:06.158
Wow, OK. I just thought
you'd be upset about Evan,

03:06.193 --> 03:09.262
maybe even show some
real human emotion,

03:09.296 --> 03:11.564
- but, whatever.
- Wow, OK.

03:11.598 --> 03:13.499
Thanks for checking
in with me, big sis.

03:14.701 --> 03:16.302
Have you seen today's paper?

03:16.336 --> 03:18.838
Those administration asshats
canceled Greek Week.

03:18.872 --> 03:20.806
- What? Why?
- I'll summarize.

03:20.841 --> 03:22.441
Some crap about budgetary issues,

03:22.476 --> 03:24.777
more crap about moving
funds to next year's rush,

03:24.811 --> 03:27.313
and total crap about no
more Blue Ribbon events.

03:27.347 --> 03:29.015
But Greek Week was our
last chance to take down

03:29.049 --> 03:31.083
the Gamma Psis before we graduate.

03:31.118 --> 03:33.986
- Without it, we finish...
- Number two.

03:34.987 --> 03:44.987
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:47.701 --> 03:51.871
Oh, hi, Natalie.
Isn't this Katherine's room?

03:51.905 --> 03:54.340
Sure is. I mean, ever since
you burned down our house.

03:54.374 --> 03:57.143
So sorry to hear about the
cancellation of Greek Week, Case.

03:57.177 --> 03:58.511
I'm super bummed for you guys.

03:58.545 --> 04:00.746
I mean, I had no idea when
I started the petition

04:00.781 --> 04:04.216
to redistribute funds to next
year's rush it would actually do it.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.552
I guess now ZBZ will have
to go into rush number two.

04:06.587 --> 04:08.220
Good luck getting the
best girls with that.

04:08.255 --> 04:10.990
Oh, and, uh, tell Ash to
say hi to Pete for me,

04:11.024 --> 04:13.960
- if they're still dating.
- They're actually... They're not.

04:13.994 --> 04:16.295
Oh. Super bummed for Ash, too.

04:16.329 --> 04:17.363
Bye!

04:18.398 --> 04:19.999
Casey, I was just
as surprised as you.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.867
But how can they cancel Greek Week?

04:21.902 --> 04:25.004
The boys get an extra event
with the Greek Gods of Golf,

04:25.038 --> 04:26.872
and, what, the
sororities are just done?

04:26.907 --> 04:30.476
We deserve one last chance
to win Blue Ribbon points.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.079
I mean, isn't there something that
we can do? - I wish there were,

04:33.113 --> 04:34.947
but unfortunately,
events have to be approved,

04:34.982 --> 04:37.750
voted on, and scheduled months in advance.
I mean, it's in our bylaws.

04:37.784 --> 04:41.020
However, if someone
were to point out

04:41.054 --> 04:44.156
that traditionally there was a Goddesses
portion of the Greek Gods competition

04:44.191 --> 04:45.725
we might be able to
have it reinstated.

04:45.759 --> 04:49.328
So we would play... golf?

04:49.363 --> 04:51.063
No, no.

04:51.098 --> 04:53.132
OK, let's say hypothetically
a beauty pageant portion

04:53.166 --> 04:54.900
was taken off the
calendar in the 1960s,

04:54.935 --> 04:56.969
I can only guess due
to women's liberation.

04:57.004 --> 05:00.573
But if someone were to petition
the president of Panhellenic,

05:00.607 --> 05:02.775
we might be able to have
another Blue Ribbon event.

05:06.580 --> 05:10.049
Oh! I'd like to propose

05:10.083 --> 05:14.754
that we reinstate a beauty pageant.

05:14.788 --> 05:16.889
A beauty pageant? Are you crazy?

05:16.923 --> 05:19.191
I think an event to find a Goddess

05:19.226 --> 05:20.926
should be much more geared
toward strength of character

05:20.961 --> 05:22.628
and less about superficial
outward appearances.

05:22.663 --> 05:24.196
- But you just...
- Although,

05:24.231 --> 05:25.931
if we could update it
to modern standards,

05:25.966 --> 05:27.733
I think I might be able to convince
the board to bring it back.

05:27.768 --> 05:30.236
Why would you do this?
Don't you want Gamma Psi to win?

05:30.270 --> 05:33.739
Well, personally I would have preferred
to battle it out during Greek Week.

05:33.774 --> 05:37.043
I think a victory achieved on a
technicality is far less satisfying.

05:37.077 --> 05:39.311
But I'm going to Yale Law,
so moving the frick on.

05:41.748 --> 05:45.017
I was thinking we could go to Myrtle Beach
for Spring Break with the rest of the house.

05:45.052 --> 05:46.952
Or we could do this.

05:46.987 --> 05:49.155
Sebastian went last year and
said he had such a blast.

05:49.189 --> 05:51.957
I don't know. I mean, a gay cruise?

05:51.992 --> 05:54.560
- It's kind of a singles thing.
- Not if we do it together.

05:54.594 --> 05:56.729
But we're gonna have to put
the deposit down soon, so...

05:56.763 --> 05:59.231
Hey, uh, Cal?

05:59.266 --> 06:01.167
There's a Jehovah's
Witness here to see you.

06:01.201 --> 06:03.502
Uh, I'm a Baptist, thank you.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.439
It's like mistaking a
Methodist for a Lutheran.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.741
Hey, guys. - Let me
know what you decide.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:17.284 --> 06:18.918
What's up, Dale?

06:18.952 --> 06:20.519
I got a favor to ask.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.089
There's this young man
in my church group, Adam,

06:23.123 --> 06:27.426
who has some difficult questions
that I'm afraid I'm not...

06:27.461 --> 06:29.428
...qualified to answer.

06:29.463 --> 06:31.564
He thinks he might be like you.

06:31.598 --> 06:33.699
- Catholic?
- Gay.

06:33.734 --> 06:36.435
And, after three months
of talking to the pastor,

06:36.470 --> 06:38.304
he's still not giving in.

06:38.338 --> 06:41.907
Oh, I see. So you want me to talk
him out of making this choice?

06:41.942 --> 06:45.311
It's not a choice, Calvin.
For a gay guy, you're awfully ignorant.

06:45.345 --> 06:48.581
No, he just, you know,
he's never met a gay person before.

06:48.615 --> 06:49.615
Well, that he knows of.

06:49.649 --> 06:51.784
He just wants to
talk to a gay person,

06:51.818 --> 06:53.519
and there's nobody like
that at our church...

06:54.554 --> 06:56.589
...that we know of.

06:56.623 --> 06:59.158
Well, of course, Dale.
I'd be happy to help you.

06:59.192 --> 07:00.593
Thank you.

07:00.627 --> 07:02.595
Ah, I've never been
on a cruise before.

07:02.629 --> 07:05.798
These guys look like they're
having fun... on each other.

07:09.603 --> 07:12.905
So Cappie and I were talking
about his big revenge plans

07:12.939 --> 07:14.840
against the Omega Chi, but...

07:14.875 --> 07:17.777
You know, I forgot
some of the details.

07:17.811 --> 07:21.413
What was the first part? - Forget it.
He hasn't told me anything.

07:21.448 --> 07:22.948
Ooh, grab that table.

07:25.719 --> 07:29.188
Case, listen, I know you're
mad at me for punching Rusty,

07:29.222 --> 07:32.057
and I just wanted to say
that I am sorry, OK?

07:32.092 --> 07:34.794
I was in a really bad place
over Rebecca cheating on me

07:34.828 --> 07:37.129
and unfortunately your
brother took the brunt of it.

07:37.164 --> 07:40.266
Wrong place at the wrong time.
I'm sorry.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.334
OK, I appreciate that,

07:42.369 --> 07:45.404
but you should tell Rusty.
He's right over there.

07:49.009 --> 07:50.009
OK.

07:51.611 --> 07:53.145
Rusty.

07:53.180 --> 07:56.849
I just wanted to say
sorry for hitting you.

07:56.883 --> 07:59.018
I don't accept your apology,
because three of my friends

07:59.052 --> 08:00.619
had to leave CRU because of you.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.154
Hey, you're the one
that threw it in my face

08:02.189 --> 08:03.956
about Beaver sleeping
with my girlfriend.

08:03.990 --> 08:05.524
I can't believe you
guys put him up to that

08:05.559 --> 08:07.860
just to get revenge for
those stupid expulsions.

08:07.894 --> 08:09.628
- Is that what you think?
- You crossed a line.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.097
It seems to really bother you.

08:12.132 --> 08:15.301
Too bad your humiliation
will continue

08:15.335 --> 08:18.437
when Cappie kicks your ass at
golf tomorrow. - That's not likely

08:18.471 --> 08:21.507
'cause Cappie picked up a wicked
slice when we played last semester.

08:22.976 --> 08:25.611
Last semester?
You mean freshman year, right?

08:25.645 --> 08:28.714
No, I mean last semester,
wh Cappie and I buried the hatchet.

08:28.748 --> 08:32.418
- You really didn't know.
- No, that is impossible.

08:32.452 --> 08:34.753
Cappie's my friend.
He would've told me.

08:34.788 --> 08:36.554
Well, sounds to me
like maybe you two

08:36.590 --> 08:38.390
aren't such good friends after all.

08:39.426 --> 08:42.160
- So, everything's good?
- Mm-hmm.

08:42.195 --> 08:44.630
Yeah, we're all good.
We're all friends here.

08:50.770 --> 08:52.171
Guess who?

08:54.374 --> 08:56.642
What are you doing?

08:56.676 --> 08:59.511
Come on. - I don't
like guessing games

08:59.546 --> 09:03.148
or public displays of affection.
I'm a very private person.

09:03.183 --> 09:06.418
But I need a little
PDA from my GF NNT.

09:06.453 --> 09:08.287
That's "now 'n' then.
" I made that one up.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.556
Dale, let's not label what we have,

09:10.590 --> 09:15.628
or initial it, or speak about
it out loud with other people.

09:18.798 --> 09:23.369
I prefer if we keep this
relationship in the pantry for now.

09:26.039 --> 09:28.507
All right. Uh, you do
admit it's a relationship.

09:28.541 --> 09:31.744
- That's a start.
- Then it's settled.

09:31.778 --> 09:35.481
What happens in the pantry
stays in the pantry.

09:44.124 --> 09:46.759
"The pageant will consist of
an evening gown competition,

09:46.793 --> 09:50.562
followed by a socially relevant and
intellectually challenging Q & A."

09:50.597 --> 09:53.032
So we have to choose one
member to represent the house

09:53.066 --> 09:55.935
who exemplifies all
the qualities of...

09:55.969 --> 09:57.903
- I nominate Ashleigh!
- I second that!

09:57.938 --> 10:01.974
- I'm retired.
- Yeah, Ash has a pageant past.

10:02.008 --> 10:03.776
I had a respectable career.

10:03.810 --> 10:06.445
I was crowned Little Miss Perfect,
Little Miss Princess,

10:06.479 --> 10:09.114
Little Miss Unincorporated
Arapahoe County

10:09.149 --> 10:12.051
before hanging up my dental
flippers at age six...

10:13.320 --> 10:14.586
...whe. the pressure got to me.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.559
So...

10:20.593 --> 10:22.728
I would like to
nominate Casey instead.

10:22.762 --> 10:25.764
And I'd like to nominate Rebecca!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.600
- Beth?
- Beth?

10:28.635 --> 10:32.671
- Can she even nominate?
- I accept the nomination.

10:32.706 --> 10:35.341
Really? Rebecca,
you want to compete?

10:35.375 --> 10:38.844
Why wouldn't I? - Well,
given the whole Beaver thing...

10:38.878 --> 10:42.014
Hey, it didn't hurt Vanessa Williams'
career. - No, not... not that.

10:42.048 --> 10:44.883
Um, it's just probably best if
you stay out of the limelight

10:44.918 --> 10:49.455
due to all of your... scandals.
We need to win. No offense.

10:51.358 --> 10:53.258
All right. All those in favor

10:53.293 --> 10:57.296
of Casey representing ZBZ in
the Greek Goddess pageant?

11:03.536 --> 11:05.771
OK, great!

11:05.805 --> 11:07.840
This crowd has gone deadly silent.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.875
Cinderella story, out of nowhere,

11:09.909 --> 11:13.512
a former greenskeeper
now about to become...

11:13.546 --> 11:14.813
...the Masters champion.

11:17.450 --> 11:18.650
Ow!

11:18.685 --> 11:21.453
Hey, Cap. Put down the club.
I gotta talk to you.

11:21.488 --> 11:23.655
Oh, certainly, Your Eminency.

11:24.524 --> 11:25.991
I spoke to your buddy Evan.

11:26.026 --> 11:27.960
- Said you're quite the golfer.
- Gopher?

11:27.994 --> 11:31.096
Golfer! Something about
your slice last semester,

11:31.131 --> 11:33.098
when you guys were friends.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.701
OK, yes, Evan and I called a truce,

11:35.735 --> 11:37.703
but that was last semester.
Everything's changed

11:37.737 --> 11:40.439
Were you guys friends when
Wade and the guys got expelled?

11:42.609 --> 11:44.643
You can't tell me about
your secret friendship,

11:44.677 --> 11:47.146
you can't tell me about your revenge
plans... - Trust me, Evan will pay.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.882
- Tell me about your plan.
- Ronald Reagan.

11:49.916 --> 11:52.551
How does a dead president help
us get revenge on Omega Chi?

12:08.949 --> 12:10.284
Where... What is...?

12:10.318 --> 12:12.453
Gee, I wonder who
could have done this?

12:13.688 --> 12:16.957
Jigsaw? - Clearly it
was the Omega Chi.

12:16.992 --> 12:19.994
They must have done this so you
wouldn't beat your pal Evan at golf.

12:20.028 --> 12:21.895
Ex-pal. - They never
would have kidnapped us

12:21.930 --> 12:24.331
if you hadn't dragged your feet
on your whole revenge plan.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.800
Come on. No, I want to
hear Cappie's master plan.

12:28.637 --> 12:31.639
- I mean, don't you trust me?
- No, it's about me and Evan.

12:31.673 --> 12:34.074
How many times do I have to get hit
in the face before it's about me too?

12:34.109 --> 12:36.477
I don't know.
How many times has it been?

12:36.511 --> 12:38.746
I don't want to drag
other people into it, OK?

12:38.780 --> 12:41.315
Like Wade, Jeremy, and Ferret?

12:41.349 --> 12:44.518
You know what? Why don't you just
stick to the science and beaker stuff

12:44.552 --> 12:46.420
and I'll handle the revenge, OK?

12:46.454 --> 12:48.122
In the meantime I'll
figure out a way to escape

12:48.156 --> 12:50.891
since you won't share
your plan in that either.

12:54.296 --> 12:56.597
Beauty pageants require contestants

12:56.631 --> 12:59.266
to answer important questions
about difficult issues.

12:59.301 --> 13:00.868
While parading around in swimsuits.

13:00.902 --> 13:04.004
Not our pageant. Katherine
lifted the swimsuit portion.

13:04.039 --> 13:06.206
Boo! Why?

13:06.241 --> 13:09.777
Because we're promoting "female
empowerment," not bulimia.

13:09.811 --> 13:13.681
Oh, look, my big sis and my ex.

13:13.715 --> 13:14.948
So much for sisterhood.

13:14.983 --> 13:18.419
Rebecca, you can't
expect me to pick sides.

13:18.453 --> 13:20.120
You're right.

13:20.155 --> 13:22.556
You should be there for Evan
just as you've been there for me.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.191
But I guess you've been
too busy with the pageant.

13:24.225 --> 13:26.627
Why are you so
against me competing?

13:26.661 --> 13:28.395
You always have to be the hero.

13:28.430 --> 13:30.964
It's my responsibility to
get the house back on top.

13:30.999 --> 13:33.367
Well, what will you do next
year to validate yourself

13:33.401 --> 13:36.303
when there are no ZBZ
contests for you to win?

13:36.338 --> 13:38.405
And you, I know you're the one

13:38.440 --> 13:40.240
who broke into my room and
took back the necklace.

13:40.275 --> 13:42.343
I should call the cops.

13:44.112 --> 13:47.181
But I won't. So I guess
that makes us even.

13:54.322 --> 13:55.856
Wow.

13:57.525 --> 14:00.728
So, Adam, uh, Dale has
told me what's going on,

14:00.762 --> 14:04.465
what you're feeling. Let's talk.

14:04.499 --> 14:07.134
I think I might be...

14:08.269 --> 14:10.003
Uh...

14:10.038 --> 14:14.408
-...gay. - See? It's OK
to say the word out loud.

14:14.442 --> 14:18.445
<i>- What makes you think so?
- I saw New Moon six times.</i>

14:18.480 --> 14:20.514
Aw, man, that Mormon bunk again?

14:20.548 --> 14:23.050
Yeah, that is definitely a sign.

14:23.084 --> 14:26.387
You know, my pastor says
being gay is lonely,

14:26.421 --> 14:29.189
like, you'll never find love,

14:29.224 --> 14:30.924
or have a real relationship.

14:30.959 --> 14:34.862
Well, no offense to your pastor,
but he's an idiot.

14:34.896 --> 14:36.797
I'm in a really good
relationship right now,

14:36.831 --> 14:38.232
with a guy who just came out,
actually.

14:38.266 --> 14:41.702
Just like that? He came out
and you found each other?

14:41.736 --> 14:44.204
No. You can't always count on that.

14:44.239 --> 14:46.373
Usually it's a process.

14:46.408 --> 14:49.710
You have to spend some time
figuring out who you really are

14:49.744 --> 14:51.578
before you know what you
want in someone else.

14:51.613 --> 14:53.914
And you and your boyfriend,
you both want the same thing?

14:56.651 --> 14:58.819
Hey, why don't you bring
Grant to our next coffee,

14:58.853 --> 15:02.189
so we can show Adam how happy
and gay and committed you are.

15:03.825 --> 15:08.028
Sure. Yeah, I know he would love
to show you how happy we are.

15:16.037 --> 15:17.671
<i>- Saved By The Bell!
- Been said!</i>

15:17.705 --> 15:18.772
<i>The College Years.</i>

15:18.807 --> 15:21.308
Damn, '90s TV tag is hard.

15:21.342 --> 15:24.144
Um... excuse me.

15:24.179 --> 15:26.914
Yeah, I hate to interrupt while
you're curing world hunger and all,

15:26.948 --> 15:30.017
but I haven't been able to reach
Rusty all day and I'm kinda worried.

15:30.051 --> 15:31.452
Haven't seen him. Try Cappie.

15:31.486 --> 15:33.020
You know, I haven't
seen Cappie either.

15:33.054 --> 15:34.955
So two of your
brothers are missing?

15:34.989 --> 15:36.523
Sounds like it.

15:36.558 --> 15:39.693
- And your golf tournament is today?
- Yeah, in like an hour.

15:39.727 --> 15:42.329
Against your big rival
fraternity the Omega Chis?

15:42.363 --> 15:43.464
Yeah. We hate them.

15:43.498 --> 15:45.632
So isn't it just a little bit weird

15:45.667 --> 15:47.234
that they're both not here?

15:48.770 --> 15:50.437
OK, we don't have time
for your questions.

15:50.472 --> 15:52.840
Cappie and Rusty have been
kidnapped by the Omega Chis.

15:52.874 --> 15:55.809
- What's up with the Omega Chis?
- We think they kidnapped Rusty and Cappie.

15:55.844 --> 15:58.212
- We'll find them.
- Hurry! It's almost tee time.

15:58.246 --> 16:00.347
- We don't have time for tea!
- Golf, Beav.

16:06.387 --> 16:09.356
You know, I can't believe Rebecca
thinks I'm doing this for the credit,

16:09.390 --> 16:11.391
or that I'm having
trouble letting go.

16:11.426 --> 16:12.993
You need to stop
worrying about that

16:13.027 --> 16:14.728
and start worrying
more about "smysing."

16:14.762 --> 16:17.664
- What?
- Smiling with your eyes.

16:17.699 --> 16:19.500
You look like a mime on drugs.

16:19.534 --> 16:22.402
Hey, Casey. I heard
you were competing.

16:22.437 --> 16:24.071
Would you like to
meet your competition?

16:24.105 --> 16:26.206
This is Eliana Hernandez.

16:26.241 --> 16:29.009
She's a very recent Gamma
Psi transfer from UCLA,

16:29.043 --> 16:32.045
but grew up in Caracas, Venezuela.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.548
We were gown shopping.
She's from warm climates

16:34.582 --> 16:36.250
and her longest dress
was mid-thigh-high.

16:36.284 --> 16:37.584
So against the rules.

16:37.619 --> 16:39.820
Well, we're just on our
way to the tailor now.

16:39.854 --> 16:43.824
She won't need that. She's so tall
and thin she could wear runway sizes.

16:43.858 --> 16:46.426
Well, good luck tomorrow. Bye!

16:46.461 --> 16:48.595
You're the one who's
gonna need the luck.

16:50.098 --> 16:52.366
Venezuela almost always
wins Miss Universe

16:52.400 --> 16:54.735
and California dominates Miss USA,

16:54.769 --> 16:57.804
so a Venezuelan-Californian
is virtually unbeatable.

17:01.576 --> 17:05.579
I am all for shenanigans,
but I really have to pee.

17:09.183 --> 17:12.319
Is it manly to pee down your leg
as long as you're not scared?

17:12.353 --> 17:14.253
Because I'm not scared, by the way.

17:14.289 --> 17:15.789
Hey, how'd you do that?

17:17.825 --> 17:19.760
This stuff dissolves adhesive.

17:19.794 --> 17:22.596
Looks like my beakers and my science
stuff came in pretty handy, huh?

17:22.630 --> 17:24.798
- Say hi to Evan for me.
- Wait! No, hey...

17:24.832 --> 17:26.400
Rus! Not funny.

17:28.002 --> 17:30.337
Rusty, come on. Rusty!

17:34.208 --> 17:36.243
Who's holding that WD-40 now?

17:36.277 --> 17:38.779
Say it, Cap. Say it...

17:38.813 --> 17:41.582
Fine! You're holding the WD-40 now.

17:41.616 --> 17:42.983
Come on, take this off.

17:50.158 --> 17:51.792
Oh!

17:51.826 --> 17:54.227
- It's the Omega Chi.
- God, I have to pee.

17:58.533 --> 18:01.735
Rusty and Cappie,
we're here to rescue you!

18:02.437 --> 18:04.304
Where'd they go?

18:04.339 --> 18:06.306
Are the brothers gonna get
mad when they find out

18:06.341 --> 18:08.575
it was us who kidnapped them?

18:08.610 --> 18:10.310
And then lost them?

18:10.345 --> 18:13.280
I think I peed a little.

18:23.858 --> 18:25.459
Maybe there's a gas
station down the road.

18:25.493 --> 18:27.795
- But you just went.
- So we can use their phone.

18:29.431 --> 18:30.931
I think it'll be faster this way.

18:30.966 --> 18:32.733
Well, I trust my instincts.

18:32.767 --> 18:35.436
Is it really that big of
a deal that we go my way?

18:35.470 --> 18:37.171
I mean, back there,
who was holding...

18:37.205 --> 18:38.639
The WD-40, yeah, I know.

18:38.673 --> 18:40.174
But I'm the president of the house.

18:40.208 --> 18:42.076
And if I have to keep
something from my little bro

18:42.110 --> 18:45.679
for the sake of the national/house security,
then you have to accept that.

18:45.714 --> 18:48.048
Maybe I'm tired of always
being your "little brother."

18:48.083 --> 18:50.517
You'd rather be my little sister? - Fine.
You go your wrong way,

18:50.552 --> 18:53.787
- I'm gonna go mine.
- Fine! But I'm more fine.

18:53.822 --> 18:55.956
- Finer.
- The finest!

19:08.270 --> 19:09.903
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:09.938 --> 19:11.405
How'd it go with that kid?

19:11.439 --> 19:13.941
Uh, I told him that you
would come along next time.

19:13.975 --> 19:17.344
- I mean, if you can.
- Sure, no problem.

19:18.446 --> 19:20.447
So, what's the verdict
with the cruise?

19:23.685 --> 19:25.486
I'm sorry, I just...

19:25.520 --> 19:29.423
I don't really want to spend Spring Break
with a bunch of single gay strangers.

19:29.457 --> 19:33.227
So you'd rather spend it with thousands
of drunk homophobic straight dudes

19:33.261 --> 19:35.629
and girls with low
self-esteem and wet T-shirts?

19:35.664 --> 19:39.033
No, I would rather spend
it with you and our friends

19:39.067 --> 19:41.468
rather than spend a week
on the gay Love Boat.

19:41.503 --> 19:44.438
Fine. Then maybe you
should go to Myrtle Beach,

19:44.472 --> 19:46.140
I'll go on the cruise.

19:52.380 --> 19:55.582
Look, I... I di$n't mean that.

19:55.617 --> 19:59.186
Are you sure? 'Cause I'm
starting to wonder if you wish

19:59.220 --> 20:03.324
you had the chance to explore
more of the single gay world

20:03.358 --> 20:06.727
before settling down in
a relationship with me.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.201
Never should have let your
brother wander off alone.

20:14.235 --> 20:15.936
Well, he couldn't
have gone too far.

20:15.970 --> 20:18.605
Unless the Omega Chis
nabbed him again.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.140
Either way, we're missing
the golf tournament.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.975
Hopefully they'll have better
luck with your beauty pageant.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.378
Maybe if we kidnap
Eliana Hernandez.

20:24.412 --> 20:28.182
She's Gamma Psi's pageant
contestant from Venezuela

20:28.216 --> 20:31.285
who transferred to CRU from UCLA.

20:31.319 --> 20:33.354
A Cali-zuelan? You're screwed.

20:34.456 --> 20:36.824
I mean, I'm sure you'll beat her.

20:38.059 --> 20:39.860
Maybe I should let Rebecca compete,

20:39.894 --> 20:41.862
so she can lose to that supermodel.

20:41.896 --> 20:44.231
Serve her right for being
such a bitch earlier.

20:44.265 --> 20:46.433
She's just pissy because she
wants to compete in the pageant

20:46.468 --> 20:49.636
- and I didn't support her.
- Why not?

20:49.671 --> 20:53.374
Because scandals don't help
pageant contestants win.

20:53.408 --> 20:55.709
They help them get on
Perez and Larry King,

20:55.744 --> 20:58.178
and this is our last chance
to put the house back on top.

20:58.213 --> 21:00.247
Are you sure it's not your
last chance to save the day?

21:00.281 --> 21:02.049
I mean, you've done so
much for the house already,

21:02.083 --> 21:04.451
maybe you don't always
need to be the hero.

21:06.921 --> 21:08.288
- There's Rusty.
- Oh.

21:10.158 --> 21:11.392
Hey.

21:12.861 --> 21:16.397
Say it, Spitter. Who has the
low-emissions vehicle now?

21:24.472 --> 21:25.873
- Yeah.
- Nice!

21:25.907 --> 21:28.041
Why didn't Kappa Tau show up?

21:34.549 --> 21:36.283
Doodie! Stop the match!

21:36.317 --> 21:39.086
- You gotta clean the course.
- We're done, you jackass.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.355
Still no word on the
Kappa Tau player.

21:41.389 --> 21:43.090
Yeah, we're here!

21:44.159 --> 21:46.293
OK! Everybody hold up!

21:46.327 --> 21:48.228
Stop playing! Cap is ready.

21:48.263 --> 21:50.297
- OK.
- It's too late. Sorry.

21:50.331 --> 21:53.033
Kappa Taus are disqualified. - No, the
Omega Chis need to be disqualified.

21:53.067 --> 21:54.768
- They kidnapped me.
- Yeah, right.

21:54.803 --> 21:56.570
Don't try and talk
your way out of this

21:56.604 --> 21:58.972
- with that fancy talk you got.
- Obviously it was you.

21:59.007 --> 22:00.441
We were transported in a black SUV,

22:00.475 --> 22:02.309
- just like the one Trip drives.
- Yeah.

22:02.343 --> 22:04.711
Uh, like that one?

22:06.614 --> 22:09.450
No, but that's Dumptruck's.

22:09.484 --> 22:11.585
Oh, my God.

22:11.619 --> 22:13.821
We were kidnapped
by our own pledges.

22:13.855 --> 22:15.889
We meant to get you back in time,

22:15.924 --> 22:17.624
but when we got to the shed,
you guys were gone.

22:17.659 --> 22:19.493
You made me miss the whole tourney.

22:19.527 --> 22:23.163
We only wanted to make our mark,
like Spitter's pledge class.

22:23.198 --> 22:24.631
Well, nice work, losers.

22:27.368 --> 22:30.037
Couldn't have done it
without you guys. Thanks!

22:34.742 --> 22:37.110
Chest out. Chin up.

22:37.145 --> 22:38.178
Chest out!

22:38.880 --> 22:41.815
"Smyse." Chest out!

22:41.850 --> 22:43.784
OK, so we need more "smysing."

22:43.818 --> 22:45.385
Smyse like you mean it.

22:45.420 --> 22:48.422
Gown in the house. - Oh,
thank you so much for picking it up, Abby.

22:48.456 --> 22:51.959
No problem. But I thought you were supposed
to wear a floor-length evening gown.

22:51.993 --> 22:54.228
Oh, what did they do?

22:54.262 --> 22:56.697
They were supposed to take
off two inches, not two feet!

22:56.731 --> 22:59.166
They said some little blonde
came in for new measurements.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.635
- I thought they meant you.
- It was probably Natalie.

23:01.669 --> 23:03.637
This would be a
floor-length gown on her.

23:03.671 --> 23:06.173
What are we gonna do? We're sunk.

23:06.207 --> 23:07.875
I have a few gowns

23:07.909 --> 23:10.611
- that'd be perfect for this competition.
- Really? From what?

23:10.645 --> 23:12.980
From being rich.
I can win the pageant.

23:13.014 --> 23:15.182
I've been walking around
and fake smiling for years.

23:20.522 --> 23:22.990
Forget it. Thought maybe you'd
finally give me a chance,

23:23.024 --> 23:24.725
but... whatever.

23:26.327 --> 23:29.730
Wait. If you really
want to do it...

23:30.932 --> 23:32.766
...then I guess it's all
riding on you, Rebecca.

23:43.442 --> 23:47.011
Testing... One... One, two,
two... Hello, everybody,

23:47.146 --> 23:51.415
and welcome to CRU's Greek Goddess
of Brains and Beauty competition.

23:51.450 --> 23:56.254
Whoo! - Now, this is not a
night about skin or swimsuits

23:56.288 --> 23:58.890
and it's not about the
objectification of women!

24:05.264 --> 24:06.564
We can just fill
in those gaps here.

24:06.598 --> 24:09.300
Come on forward.
Let's fill in the gaps.

24:09.334 --> 24:10.635
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:29.221 --> 24:31.122
Classic two-step heel plant.

24:32.658 --> 24:34.826
With pivot. She's a pro.

24:34.860 --> 24:36.828
Come on, slip!

24:47.272 --> 24:51.576
<i>* Work it like a supermodel Work
it like a supermodel *</i>

24:51.610 --> 24:56.147
<i>* Work it like a supermodel Work
it like a supermodel *</i>

24:56.181 --> 25:00.351
<i>* Work it like a supermodel Work
it like a supermodel *</i>

25:00.385 --> 25:03.087
<i>- * Work it like a supermodel *
- Slut!</i>

25:03.121 --> 25:04.522
- Tramp!
- Skank!

25:11.663 --> 25:13.998
Hey, shut the hell up! Not cool!

25:18.237 --> 25:22.306
<i>* Work it at the runway Runway,
runway *</i>

25:22.341 --> 25:26.911
<i>* Work it at the runway Work
it at the runway *</i>

25:26.945 --> 25:28.713
<i>* Work it *</i>

25:28.747 --> 25:31.048
Hey. Where's Grant?

25:31.083 --> 25:34.552
Uh, he will not be
joining us today.

25:34.586 --> 25:37.388
We're kinda having some issues.

25:37.422 --> 25:40.358
- What kind of issues?
- Uh, well,

25:40.392 --> 25:42.693
we had a disagreement
over a gay cruise.

25:42.728 --> 25:45.196
Hey, Calvin, please come
with me for a second.

25:50.202 --> 25:52.536
- What was that about?
- You're supposed to show Adam

25:52.571 --> 25:55.673
that being gay means you can be in
a healthy, committed relationship.

25:55.707 --> 25:59.377
I know, but... - Whereas the gay
cruise promotes promiscuity.

25:59.411 --> 26:01.212
- Dale, that's not...
- I saw the pictures.

26:01.246 --> 26:03.681
All those shaved calves
and snug swim trunks.

26:03.715 --> 26:06.751
You're supposed to help me,
not betray me like some gay Judas.

26:06.785 --> 26:08.319
No, you asked me to help Adam,

26:08.353 --> 26:10.187
who should know all
the facets of gay life

26:10.222 --> 26:12.924
not some just idealized version
or the stereotypes. By the way,

26:12.958 --> 26:14.859
thanks for your concern
about me and Grant.

26:14.893 --> 26:17.128
Come on!

26:19.531 --> 26:21.732
Adam...

26:21.767 --> 26:24.669
It's possible that my
relationship with Grant

26:24.703 --> 26:26.337
may not make it in the long run.

26:26.371 --> 26:29.173
It's starting to seem like
we want different things.

26:29.207 --> 26:32.443
Or, they might make
up tonight, chastely.

26:34.546 --> 26:37.815
Relationships are hard,
gay or straight.

26:37.849 --> 26:39.750
But you can't hide your
feelings in the closet

26:39.785 --> 26:42.420
and settle for something
that isn't right for you.

26:42.454 --> 26:44.622
Which is part of coming out.

26:51.196 --> 26:53.597
<i>* Oh, so he's got it made *</i>

26:53.632 --> 26:55.967
You let your brothers trash Rebecca

26:56.001 --> 26:58.636
in front of the entire Greek system.
Real classy, Chambers.

26:58.670 --> 27:00.638
Yeah, look,
I told them to stop, OK?

27:00.672 --> 27:03.341
Maybe they wouldn't have started it if
they weren't taking their cue from you.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.010
- Maybe I did punch the wrong guy.
- Maybe you did.

27:06.044 --> 27:07.645
Hey, hey! Hey!

27:07.679 --> 27:10.448
Jeez. You were the one who
stabbed him in the back.

27:10.482 --> 27:13.417
He wasn't the one who slept
with your girlfriend.

27:13.452 --> 27:16.253
You're gonna hit me again? Do it.

27:19.024 --> 27:20.891
My face is numb from all
the other times anyway.

27:22.761 --> 27:23.761
All right.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.967
Impressive, Rus.

27:30.002 --> 27:31.268
How can you be friends
with that guy?

27:31.303 --> 27:33.304
Because I thought
that he could change.

27:33.338 --> 27:35.373
I thought he could be the
guy that I wanted him to be.

27:35.407 --> 27:37.942
Well, you don't trust me,
even though I always have your back.

27:37.976 --> 27:40.911
Why won't you tell me
your plan for revenge?

27:40.946 --> 27:42.213
Because there isn't one.

27:42.247 --> 27:44.482
- Seriously?
- I have nothing,

27:44.516 --> 27:46.617
except for maybe a small
case of revenge block.

27:46.651 --> 27:48.152
You didn't think that
I could help you?

27:48.186 --> 27:50.021
I didn't want to disappoint you.
It had to be perfect,

27:50.055 --> 27:52.223
and I don't have perfect
in me right now.

27:52.257 --> 27:55.459
But I know that. You're one of the
biggest screw-ups in the school.

27:55.494 --> 27:56.694
Well, thank you very much,
my friend.

27:56.728 --> 27:58.596
But I also know that
if I have a problem

27:58.630 --> 28:02.333
I can always come to you.
I just wish you felt the same.

28:03.735 --> 28:06.771
Quit being my hero and
start being my friend.

28:20.886 --> 28:22.820
Boys can be so stupid and immature.

28:22.854 --> 28:24.321
Don't listen to any of that.

28:26.558 --> 28:29.026
I bet you didn't
expect to see this.

28:29.061 --> 28:31.462
I really wish you,
of all people, hadn't.

28:31.496 --> 28:35.232
Well, it's nice to see
that you have emotions.

28:35.267 --> 28:37.368
And tear ducts.

28:39.304 --> 28:41.972
Why would you want to put
yourself out there like that?

28:42.007 --> 28:43.974
Because I wanted to show everyone

28:44.009 --> 28:46.377
that I didn't give a crap
about how people see me.

28:46.411 --> 28:49.313
Everyone? Or Evan?

28:52.050 --> 28:54.151
I mean, do you still
care about him?

28:56.021 --> 28:57.421
Yes.

28:59.124 --> 29:00.791
And I hate that.

29:00.826 --> 29:04.261
I just thought that
because he's different

29:04.296 --> 29:07.131
and messed-up, like me...

29:08.600 --> 29:10.734
...that he'd get me.

29:12.737 --> 29:14.305
It was stupid.

29:16.308 --> 29:19.143
And now I'm screwing it up
for the whole house, too.

29:23.215 --> 29:24.448
You were right.

29:24.483 --> 29:28.819
You were a much better
choice for this.

29:28.854 --> 29:32.556
This competition is supposed
to be about confidence

29:32.591 --> 29:35.025
and elegance and strength.

29:35.060 --> 29:39.497
The fact that you even went out there,
after everything that's happened...

29:39.531 --> 29:42.633
...I can't think of anyone who's
all of those things more than you.

29:43.535 --> 29:45.102
You're the perfect choice.

29:47.305 --> 29:51.976
I don't think I can go out there
for the final question round.

29:52.010 --> 29:55.913
You can. I know we've
had our differences,

29:55.947 --> 29:58.682
and sometimes, wow,
you really have pissed me off...

30:00.685 --> 30:03.754
...but you're the future of ZBZ.

30:03.788 --> 30:07.491
We may or may not win tonight,

30:07.526 --> 30:11.228
but I know that ZBZ will
be number one again,

30:11.263 --> 30:15.766
and when that day happens,
it'll be because of you.

30:17.435 --> 30:22.373
Now, go out there and kick
some Cali-zuelan ass, OK?

30:37.334 --> 30:40.036
Our next contestant is
a communications major.

30:40.071 --> 30:41.871
We have Gamma Psi's
Eliana Hernandez.

30:42.506 --> 30:46.609
Eliana, what is
your favorite class?

30:48.645 --> 30:52.148
I like English very much.

30:52.182 --> 30:55.918
Uh, thank you for
me liking America.

30:55.952 --> 31:00.089
Please note, everyone, English is her
fourth language. Very impressive.

31:00.123 --> 31:03.259
Moving on. Our next contestant
is a psychology major

31:03.293 --> 31:06.529
with a political upbringing
and a passion for calligraphy.

31:06.563 --> 31:09.699
- We have ZBZ's Rebecca Logan.
- Whoo!

31:16.707 --> 31:20.142
ZBZ, what is your take
on the current debate

31:20.177 --> 31:23.379
- of healthcare reform in our country...
- This is so rigged.

31:23.413 --> 31:24.714
Thank you, Katherine,

31:24.748 --> 31:26.649
and thank you to the
pageant organizers

31:26.683 --> 31:28.417
and all those voting.

31:28.452 --> 31:30.252
This is an issue that's
been debated to death,

31:30.287 --> 31:33.155
which is where a lot of
people will end up without it.

31:33.190 --> 31:36.592
And one that's been challenged
with a great deal of hypocrisy.

31:37.928 --> 31:39.762
But you know what?

31:40.931 --> 31:43.933
Let's focus on that word:
hypocrisy.

31:45.469 --> 31:47.536
Here's an example:

31:47.571 --> 31:51.073
How girls are held to an
impossible sexual standard.

31:51.108 --> 31:52.775
How a girl can be called a "slut"

31:52.809 --> 31:55.544
while a guy's applauded
for his conquests.

31:55.579 --> 31:59.181
And when she wants to seem
strong through the name-calling,

31:59.216 --> 32:00.750
she's a bitch.

32:00.784 --> 32:04.353
And it's not just the guys
who are saying this, ladies.

32:04.388 --> 32:07.890
But it's important to
call out such hypocrisy,

32:07.924 --> 32:10.760
because we're not actually
gods and goddesses.

32:10.794 --> 32:14.797
We're humans... who make mistakes.

32:14.831 --> 32:18.234
Hopefully we learn
from them and move on,

32:18.268 --> 32:20.236
pulling ourselves back up.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.105
Recently, I made a mistake.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.641
But there's only one person here

32:25.675 --> 32:28.144
who has the right to
speak to me about it.

32:28.178 --> 32:31.280
As for everyone else...

32:31.314 --> 32:34.150
I'm Rebecca Logan, and I'm a ZBZ.

32:34.184 --> 32:35.851
And I'm damn proud of both.

32:37.220 --> 32:38.587
Whoo!

32:42.025 --> 32:44.026
Thanks.

32:52.002 --> 32:54.603
Thank you all for voting.

32:54.638 --> 32:58.240
Didn't they all look
fantastic and empowered?

32:58.275 --> 33:00.843
Now I, for one, am a firm believer

33:00.877 --> 33:02.611
that we are all winners here,

33:02.646 --> 33:05.247
but unfortunately, that is
not how a competition works.

33:05.282 --> 33:07.550
So I'd like to start by
announcing the winner

33:07.584 --> 33:09.819
of the Greek Gods
of Golf competition.

33:09.853 --> 33:11.420
The lowest score for this evening,

33:11.455 --> 33:14.690
and this year's Greek God...

33:15.992 --> 33:18.327
...is Evan Chambers from Omega Chi.

33:29.206 --> 33:32.074
And this year's Greek Goddess...

33:41.718 --> 33:43.719
...is Rebecca Logan from ZBZ.

34:07.277 --> 34:09.178
Congratulations.
I thought what you said...

34:09.212 --> 34:10.279
Save it.

34:27.597 --> 34:29.864
What do you want now, a hug?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.699
I want a chance to
kick your ass in golf.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.835
Night golf.

34:33.870 --> 34:36.572
Why should I? I already won
the IFC golf tournament.

34:36.606 --> 34:38.641
By default. You didn't beat me.

34:40.210 --> 34:44.045
All right. Yeah, fine. I'll play.
What do we get if we win?

34:44.080 --> 34:46.715
How about Pickle's uncle's beach house
he lent us for the spring break.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.717
- It's got eight bedrooms...
- No, no, no.

34:49.753 --> 34:51.053
Where are we gonna stay if we lose?

34:51.087 --> 34:52.721
We're not gonna lose.
I know what I'm doing.

34:52.755 --> 34:55.424
And if you win, however unlikely?

34:55.458 --> 34:57.259
We get your house for 24 hours,

34:57.294 --> 34:59.962
for the most badass party
and you're not invited.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.964
Don't even, Chambers.
They'll trash our whole house.

35:01.998 --> 35:04.033
Uh-oh! Pumpkinhead's scared.

35:04.067 --> 35:06.268
Just listen to me
this once, please.

35:06.303 --> 35:09.672
- Do not bet the beach house.
- It's too late. That's a deal.

35:10.974 --> 35:12.575
Good.

35:27.157 --> 35:28.891
So you want to go, uh,

35:28.925 --> 35:31.427
check out the whole
golf death match thing?

35:31.461 --> 35:34.196
Actually, I was thinking about
heading over to Gentlemen's Choice,

35:34.230 --> 35:36.932
just to grab a beer,
if that's cool.

35:36.967 --> 35:38.601
Well, you don't have
to ask me, you know.

35:38.635 --> 35:40.402
That's what you want to do.

35:41.671 --> 35:43.973
I don't... I don't
know what I want.

35:48.812 --> 35:50.145
I think you do.

35:51.381 --> 35:53.816
I think that you want to be single.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.484
That's so untrue.

35:55.518 --> 35:58.420
Oh, come on, I don't even care
about that stupid gay cruise.

35:58.455 --> 36:01.924
Come on, Grant. This isn't about
the cruise or Gentlemen's Choice.

36:01.958 --> 36:05.828
You came out of the closet right
into a relationship with me,

36:05.862 --> 36:07.896
and, you know,
you think you missed out.

36:07.931 --> 36:10.499
You want to know what
it's like to be single.

36:14.437 --> 36:16.438
Maybe. A little.

36:18.408 --> 36:22.845
I'm so grateful for everything you did,
helping me come out.

36:22.879 --> 36:23.912
Calvin...

36:26.216 --> 36:27.216
...I love you.

36:28.585 --> 36:31.887
I love you, too.
But I don't want grateful.

36:33.390 --> 36:35.924
You know, I need to
be with someone...

36:35.959 --> 36:37.993
...who wants to be with me...

36:39.396 --> 36:40.796
...just me.

36:41.998 --> 36:43.565
Are you ready for that?

36:47.604 --> 36:48.837
I don't know what to say.

36:52.609 --> 36:54.009
I think you just did.

36:56.813 --> 37:00.149
So that's it? I mean,
we're breaking up?

37:01.785 --> 37:03.852
Yeah, I... I guess we are.

37:07.057 --> 37:08.524
Wow.

37:10.326 --> 37:11.860
This is so weird.

37:14.597 --> 37:16.331
I just want to say...

37:17.934 --> 37:20.269
...thank you for everything.

37:20.303 --> 37:23.372
Look, you don't have
to thank me. Come on.

37:42.826 --> 37:45.227
All right,
so you guys ready to lose

37:45.261 --> 37:46.862
that kick-ass Spring Break suite?

37:46.896 --> 37:48.497
Are you ready for 50 drunk KTs

37:48.531 --> 37:49.865
puking and peeing in your house?

37:49.899 --> 37:51.366
And that's just in your room.

37:51.401 --> 37:53.335
All right, guys.

37:53.369 --> 37:55.070
I have your balls.

37:56.139 --> 37:57.906
The blue ball's yours, naturally.

37:57.941 --> 37:59.441
Thank you.

37:59.476 --> 38:02.010
All right, it's a one-shot
challenge with nine-irons.

38:02.045 --> 38:03.278
The closest one to the hole wins.

38:05.248 --> 38:07.783
- Are you OK?
- Uh, yeah.

38:07.817 --> 38:09.518
Grant and I just broke up.

38:09.552 --> 38:11.587
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.415
And it's... in the water!

38:40.450 --> 38:41.750
- Really?
- What?

38:41.785 --> 38:43.452
Is it?

38:44.354 --> 38:45.521
No, I wish.

38:45.555 --> 38:47.623
It's actually about
two feet from the pin.

38:51.795 --> 38:53.462
- Why would he set us up like that?
- Way to go, Evan!

38:53.496 --> 38:55.964
- Way to go! Beautiful.
- Beat that!

38:55.999 --> 38:58.567
All right. Well,
if there are no objections,

38:58.601 --> 39:00.669
I'd like Rusty to swing for me.

39:04.107 --> 39:05.808
What are you doing?
You're the golfer.

39:05.842 --> 39:07.943
Rusty, you're my little brother.

39:07.977 --> 39:11.180
You know how important this is to me.
I know you'll do the right thing.

39:28.198 --> 39:30.732
Just be the ball, OK? Be the ball.

39:30.767 --> 39:33.802
Be the ball, be the ball,
be the ball, be the ball...

39:33.837 --> 39:36.071
Just be the ball, be the ball,
be the ball, be the ball...

39:36.105 --> 39:38.240
be the ball... - It's kinda hard
when you're talking like that.

39:38.274 --> 39:41.043
Sorry.

39:52.655 --> 39:55.824
No!

40:05.401 --> 40:06.635
It's, like, right there.

40:16.412 --> 40:19.448
Attention, ladies and... ladies.

40:19.482 --> 40:22.684
I would like to present you
with this year's Greek Goddess:

40:22.719 --> 40:25.387
ZBZ's very own Rebecca Logan!

40:26.689 --> 40:29.291
And since we're all here,

40:29.325 --> 40:32.995
it is tradition for the seniors
to give a gift to the house,

40:33.029 --> 40:36.298
and we would like to
give our gift early.

40:36.332 --> 40:38.600
Well, thanks to all of
your hard work this year,

40:38.635 --> 40:40.969
and to Rebecca's win today,
our gift to you

40:41.004 --> 40:44.306
is that ZBZ is once again
the number one house!

40:46.676 --> 40:50.679
And we got you T-shirts
so you can flaunt it!

40:51.714 --> 40:53.315
Thank you.

41:00.156 --> 41:02.257
Hey, uh, Laura, uh,
I've been thinking.

41:02.292 --> 41:04.960
I enjoy our time together,

41:04.994 --> 41:09.498
but I don't want to hide it behind
graham crackers and canned tuna.

41:09.532 --> 41:12.034
You know, I want to take
it outside the pantry.

41:16.439 --> 41:18.206
No.

41:18.241 --> 41:19.942
Sorry.

41:25.848 --> 41:28.350
Uh, excuse me, everybody.

41:28.384 --> 41:29.518
Uh, attention, please.

41:29.552 --> 41:31.586
Laura and I will no
longer be involved

41:31.621 --> 41:33.655
in a semi-sexual relationship.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.958
So, as of right now,

41:35.992 --> 41:38.193
Dale Kettlewell's
back on the market.

41:49.939 --> 41:51.406
All right, everyone gather around.

41:51.441 --> 41:53.175
Spitter, come here.

42:01.985 --> 42:04.119
Hey-o!

42:04.153 --> 42:05.387
Yeah.

42:05.421 --> 42:08.657
Ah, look at your faces.

42:08.691 --> 42:10.826
- What's going on?
- We wanted Evan to win.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.762
Seriously? - So you
don't suck at golf?

42:13.796 --> 42:16.164
Oh, I suck, all right.
That was part of the plan.

42:16.199 --> 42:19.167
So we wanted to give
them the beach house?

42:19.202 --> 42:22.571
Which we'll use as the greatest
revenge KT has ever known.

42:22.605 --> 42:24.740
Ladies and gentlemen, as president

42:24.774 --> 42:27.275
it is my job to
nominate the one man

42:27.310 --> 42:31.680
who can lead us to victory and
avenge our fallen comrades.

42:31.714 --> 42:34.616
- What?
- My friend...

42:37.687 --> 42:40.455
...and our new revenge chair,
Rusty Cartwright!

42:46.462 --> 42:47.996
Bring us to the promised land, Rus.

42:48.031 --> 42:49.598
Brothers...

42:57.173 --> 42:59.307
Phase one is complete.

43:02.178 --> 43:06.581
Phase two: Myrtle Beach.
