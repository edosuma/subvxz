00:06.172 --> 00:09.843
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.636 --> 00:13.638
For the Ritual,

00:14.347 --> 00:16.641
a sacrifice is required.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.520
-A sacrifice?
-Why are you surprised?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.147
This is the country's priority.

00:22.230 --> 00:27.402
Giving a sacrifice to step into god's
domain is common throughout the world.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.989
Your job was to guide him to Fushido
and roll him to sleep.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.867
The duties thereafter are all entrusted
to the Key Girl.

00:33.950 --> 00:34.784
Key Girl?

00:34.868 --> 00:38.496
The one offered to sleep
in the Fushido of Lord Mitatsu.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.958
Literally, she is a living key to remain
married to him until her life is depleted.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.877
My God...

00:43.960 --> 00:49.466
no matter how conceited she is,
sacrificing her goes too far!

00:49.924 --> 00:55.096
Those girls were born for Lord Mitatsu's
use and understand more than anyone.

00:57.265 --> 01:00.977
Offering one's life to Lord Mitatsu
as the Key Girl

01:01.311 --> 01:04.272
is the greatest honor for a miko.

01:13.490 --> 01:15.492
<i>I have been waiting for this day.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:24.876
<i>Always waiting...</i>

01:25.960 --> 01:26.795
<i>for today.</i>

01:28.213 --> 01:32.383
And they say that the Key Girl and
Lord Mitatsu become one for all eternity!

01:32.550 --> 01:34.886
That moment's supposed to feel amazing.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.387
Seriously? Even more than that?

01:37.055 --> 01:40.058
-More than what?
-Natsume, you're so out of it.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.102
They're talking about sex.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.019
Get it?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.857
Natsume.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.237
Haru.

01:54.989 --> 01:56.407
<i>I am the Key Girl.</i>

01:57.450 --> 01:59.702
<i>I will drive the key into Lord Mitatsu</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.204
<i>and pledge myself to him</i>

02:02.413 --> 02:03.248
<i>for eternity.</i>

02:21.224 --> 02:24.185
She was chosen to be the Key Girl.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.063
I wanted to save her.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.567
I didn't care about the country
or the Ritual,

02:31.234 --> 02:33.236
just... her.

02:35.905 --> 02:39.909
We planned on escaping during the Ritual.

02:40.410 --> 02:44.330
Riding away on Montparnasse... on Masotan.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.874
Montparnasse...

02:46.166 --> 02:47.041
However...

02:49.586 --> 02:51.838
Lord Mitatsu was a step ahead of us.

02:51.921 --> 02:55.425
He understood the gravity of our actions.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.387
Sada... I can't go after all.

02:59.804 --> 03:02.765
You promised we would run away together!

03:03.391 --> 03:04.642
You said we'd go to Paris!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.271
If I didn't become the Key Girl,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.690
The country would be finished.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.610
Many people would disappear.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.655
You, my parents...

03:18.448 --> 03:20.283
-But...
-I was so glad...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.535
to have met you.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.788
If I close my eyes, I can float.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.460
Look at our beloved Montparnasse.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.337
Yae...

03:43.973 --> 03:44.807
Yae!

03:45.558 --> 03:49.520
If this is the last view I see,

03:50.980 --> 03:52.023
then I am happy.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.193
Yae!

03:59.364 --> 04:00.907
People betray one another.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.534
Yes.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.912
I betrayed Yae.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.625
But I will no longer betray anyone.

04:11.459 --> 04:15.630
I resolved to give everything I have
to Montparnasse.

04:16.381 --> 04:21.427
But... Montparnasse rejected me.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.430
It's no surprise.

04:25.181 --> 04:29.560
I never wished to become one
with Montparnasse.

04:30.770 --> 04:36.859
This time, I will definitively finish the
Ritual that Yae gave her life for.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.865
That is my only wish.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.368
What should we do?

04:45.451 --> 04:48.329
We didn't hear anything about a sacrifice!

04:48.454 --> 04:53.126
I can't even think of someone
being sacrificed... I just can't!

04:53.209 --> 04:55.586
But if the Key Girl doesn't succeed...

04:55.712 --> 04:59.424
Then we'll all be doomed to die
with the submergence of Japan.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.343
I wonder if we can get
everyone to find shelter...

05:02.427 --> 05:04.012
Technical Sergeant Amakasu.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.388
Yes?

05:05.638 --> 05:09.225
Between someone I cherished
and the Ritual,

05:09.350 --> 05:12.228
I couldn't choose either
and was left in limbo.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.608
But you... chose both.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.863
On top of that, you flew.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.699
I want to ask you this...

05:25.950 --> 05:28.453
Hisone Amakasu, in this situation,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.581
which future would you choose?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.684
<i>She's back.</i>

05:52.477 --> 05:54.187
<i>Amakasu came back.</i>

05:57.273 --> 05:59.150
<i>I was convinced...</i>

06:00.985 --> 06:03.905
<i>that things were just the way they were.</i>

06:06.324 --> 06:07.325
<i>But...</i>

06:07.825 --> 06:11.329
<i>what other people accept as normal</i>

06:11.996 --> 06:14.415
<i>are things that I fret and struggle over.</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:21.339
<i>When I saw that Amakasu searched</i>
<i>for answers that were only right for her,</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:24.384
<i>I realized that maybe...</i>

06:25.051 --> 06:27.053
<i>there is no normal to be found.</i>

06:36.521 --> 06:37.355
Amakasu,

06:38.147 --> 06:39.941
If you were me, what would you say?

06:40.191 --> 06:41.692
I will prevent it!

06:42.110 --> 06:44.904
I cannot stand by and watch someone die!

06:45.196 --> 06:47.824
We're still members
of the Air Self-Defense Force!

06:48.074 --> 06:49.700
Then the country will--

06:49.784 --> 06:50.910
No, it won't!

06:50.993 --> 06:52.412
She can't think clearly.

06:52.495 --> 06:55.123
I can think!
I'm thinking at full throttle!

06:55.415 --> 06:58.709
Aside from the sacrifice, we've only
recently found out about the Ritual!

06:58.793 --> 07:01.712
If we discussed it together, then maybe
we could've found a way out!

07:02.171 --> 07:03.756
But this has been going on for years--

07:03.840 --> 07:05.258
Who decided that?

07:05.508 --> 07:08.845
What time? What minute? What second?
How many revolutions of the earth?

07:10.221 --> 07:12.473
-Wow, she's like a child.
-Yes, she is.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.562
The large-scale OTF's activity has
yet to resume.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.856
It'll soon be two hours.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.191
If he isn't rolled to sleep...

07:22.316 --> 07:23.901
What are those girls doing?!

07:24.193 --> 07:26.696
Telemetry signal from an OTF is confirmed!

07:27.029 --> 07:27.864
Finally!

07:28.197 --> 07:30.199
But the activation is coming

07:30.366 --> 07:31.826
only from one aircraft!

07:50.011 --> 07:50.928
<i>I wonder why?</i>

07:52.138 --> 07:54.140
<i>Haru and I...</i>

07:55.099 --> 07:57.185
<i>have lived for this day.</i>

08:00.021 --> 08:00.938
<i>But...</i>

08:11.824 --> 08:14.368
<i>it doesn't feel good at all.</i>

08:15.953 --> 08:16.954
Natsu--

08:28.925 --> 08:30.676
Amakasu?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.303
Don't do it, Natsume!

08:32.595 --> 08:34.347
Sacrificing yourself is crazy!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.015
Get out of here!

08:36.098 --> 08:38.893
How far will you go to interfere?
It's annoying!

08:39.268 --> 08:41.270
I've waited my whole life for this day.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.481
It was the same for us too, you know.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.901
For Haru and me, this is the climax.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.820
There's not even a hair's width
of space for you here.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.160
Then you're a cheater,
aren't you, Natsume?

08:57.078 --> 09:00.206
You're going to be married for life
to Lord Mitatsu, right?

09:00.289 --> 09:03.751
Isn't that a weird climax
to share with Okonogi?

09:03.834 --> 09:05.503
That is an illicit sexual affair!

09:05.586 --> 09:06.879
Well that's the way it goes!

09:06.963 --> 09:08.047
In that case,

09:08.172 --> 09:12.093
the epilogue will be a new world
for me and Haru!

09:12.385 --> 09:13.678
Haru?

09:13.928 --> 09:16.055
Because I like Haru!

09:16.138 --> 09:19.183
And it's a purer,
purer feeling than yours!

09:19.684 --> 09:24.689
Once you're gone, I'll be enjoying
my first love Haru to the very fullest!

09:24.772 --> 09:26.440
He's my first love!

09:26.524 --> 09:29.944
-And I've liked him since I was a kid!
-Calm down, you two!

09:30.027 --> 09:32.905
I've never liked another boy
and matured for my first love...

09:32.989 --> 09:36.075
-How long will this go on?
-Who knows?

09:36.158 --> 09:36.993
Who needs that?!

09:37.410 --> 09:38.953
Once you're gone,

09:39.036 --> 09:42.873
Haru and I will
instantly start making out!

09:43.165 --> 09:44.917
-Of course you won't!
-In that case...

09:45.793 --> 09:47.003
live!

09:51.173 --> 09:53.259
Fight with me over Haru!

09:53.384 --> 09:56.387
A fair and square fight for love!

09:56.512 --> 09:59.015
I've never competed with anyone before.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.894
But I can have
a refreshing battle with you, Natsume!

10:08.107 --> 10:09.233
Amakasu.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.570
Oh no!

10:13.070 --> 10:14.155
Lord Mitatsu is...

10:20.661 --> 10:23.164
The large-scale OTF has begun
to sink in elevation.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.957
-Is it being rolled to sleep?
-Unknown.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.709
Currently at 1500 feet.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.877
Still falling in elevation.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.632
They didn't put him to sleep.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.302
This is the end of the Ritual.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.762
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

10:38.512 --> 10:42.433
There is no time left to put
Lord Mitatsu to sleep.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.978
We will roll in him into sleep like this.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.566
Hiso Maso!

10:53.694 --> 10:58.449
Normally, the Ritual lures Lord Mitatsu
to sleep and then we roll him over.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.620
Then, the Key Girl's prayer
would stabilize the land.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.956
However, this time
we won't lure him to sleep,

11:06.332 --> 11:08.209
and force him to roll over.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.169
What after that?

11:10.294 --> 11:12.046
<i>We'll figure it out as we go along.</i>

11:12.129 --> 11:13.297
Quit taking liberties!

11:13.381 --> 11:15.675
<i>This is in the realm of the Dragon Pilots!</i>

11:16.384 --> 11:20.680
No matter what order you give from
your safe place, we're the ones doing it!

11:21.097 --> 11:24.767
If you want to talk the talk,
then come here and walk the walk.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.687
<i>Everyone!</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:30.815
-Hitomin!
-<i>There's been a change of plans.</i>

11:30.981 --> 11:34.819
<i>We are going to force</i>
<i>Lord Mitatsu to roll over!</i>

11:35.444 --> 11:40.199
<i>Everyone, please evacuate</i>
<i>to the transport module for now!</i>

11:40.282 --> 11:44.620
That's impossible! Even if you succeed,
without a Key Girl, Lord Mitatsu will--

11:44.704 --> 11:47.123
-Yeah. Hurry up!
-That hurts!

11:56.340 --> 11:57.425
I'm here!

11:57.883 --> 11:59.760
Get to the rendezvous point quickly!

11:59.844 --> 12:03.431
-<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>
-I'll direct from the transport module.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.434
Hisone Amakasu, I want you to show me

12:07.101 --> 12:08.978
<i>the skies you choose!</i>

12:09.854 --> 12:10.688
Yes, ma'am!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.567
<i>To the Yokota COC. This is Shenron.</i>

12:15.025 --> 12:17.153
<i>We will begin the rolling now.</i>

12:17.236 --> 12:18.070
<i>Roger.</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:21.907
<i>Your target is the Shimenawa rope</i>
<i>made of his tails tied together.</i>

12:22.491 --> 12:24.910
<i>Once you shoot the harpoon,</i>
<i>there is no do-over!</i>

12:25.161 --> 12:27.413
<i>Do it as carefully</i>
<i>and quickly as possible!</i>

12:27.705 --> 12:28.539
Yes, ma'am!

12:46.849 --> 12:48.225
<i>Wyvern has dropped the pod!</i>

12:48.559 --> 12:51.771
<i>Send the F patrolling the area that way,</i>
<i>or at least an AAM!</i>

12:51.854 --> 12:54.231
The large-scale OTF is
at the center of the storm area.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.275
We cannot get close.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.068
<i>New contact. It's Serpent!</i>

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
Sorry for the wait!

13:03.908 --> 13:04.825
Masotan!

13:05.534 --> 13:07.995
They're going to take on Lord Mitatsu...

13:08.162 --> 13:09.455
They can't possibly do it.

13:12.249 --> 13:16.170
Masotan and I are betting
everything on this one shot!

13:21.550 --> 13:23.969
<i>You blockhead!</i>

13:24.261 --> 13:25.763
No, there's still a chance!

13:25.846 --> 13:27.181
<i>But the harpoon--</i>

13:27.264 --> 13:29.850
We have Masotan and the others!

13:34.647 --> 13:35.481
Masotan!

13:56.210 --> 13:58.462
<i>You lead the timing! Let's do it together!</i>

13:58.546 --> 14:00.548
-But...
-<i>It's worth trying!</i>

14:00.798 --> 14:01.632
Okay!

14:03.092 --> 14:06.554
Go! All the way to the limit!

14:14.186 --> 14:15.062
They did it!

14:15.563 --> 14:16.480
We did it!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.066
That girl's impressive.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.569
Yeah, she is.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.573
Those girls found it.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.284
<i>They live...</i>

14:29.285 --> 14:30.661
<i>and they found it...</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:33.247
<i>the thing they cherish.</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:36.417
<i>That's why they're strong.</i>

14:37.084 --> 14:37.918
<i>Always...</i>

14:40.838 --> 14:41.672
I...

14:42.882 --> 14:43.716
haven't...

14:45.092 --> 14:46.302
found mine yet.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.888
-Natsume.
-I haven't found it.

14:49.597 --> 14:50.764
Nothing yet.

14:53.058 --> 14:53.934
I...

14:55.853 --> 14:57.271
don't want to die!

15:00.399 --> 15:01.233
Yeah.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.570
Let's live, Natsume.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.204
Do it now, Key Girl!

15:14.747 --> 15:17.458
Pierce the bell staff straight
into Lord Mitatsu's heart!

15:18.083 --> 15:20.210
With it wedged into the axis of rotation,

15:20.586 --> 15:22.046
it will stop the rolling!

15:22.463 --> 15:23.422
However,

15:23.547 --> 15:28.385
blocking the axis means
she cannot return to us.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.639
It's a physical thing?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.475
<i>Then that means anyone can do it,</i>
<i>not just the Key Girl!</i>

15:34.600 --> 15:38.520
<i>Which means a sacrifice is</i>
<i>necessary either way.</i>

15:42.399 --> 15:43.901
Can you let me do it?

15:44.109 --> 15:45.611
Haru?

15:45.861 --> 15:48.197
I'll wedge the key inside
instead of Natsume!

15:48.280 --> 15:50.199
Wait, Haru! The bell staff is--

15:50.282 --> 15:51.158
It's okay.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.535
-I can't let you--
-That's not it.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.872
I dropped the bell staff.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.290
Oh my God!

15:58.457 --> 15:59.959
We're out of options...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.921
<i>Excuse me for jumping in the middle.</i>

16:04.546 --> 16:05.381
Amakasu?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.424
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

16:08.133 --> 16:09.969
What are you saying, Amakasu?

16:10.052 --> 16:12.471
It just seemed like
we weren't getting anywhere...

16:13.097 --> 16:15.683
<i>And I recovered the bell staff,</i>
<i>so no worries!</i>

16:15.849 --> 16:17.476
Don't do it, Amakasu!

16:17.685 --> 16:18.769
Why you!

16:18.894 --> 16:21.480
<i>Dealing with issues doesn't</i>
<i>exclude danger!</i>

16:21.563 --> 16:23.816
My body is for carrying out my duties,

16:23.941 --> 16:26.527
and with it I vow to take charge
for the citizens of our nation!

16:26.860 --> 16:29.613
-Wait, Technical Sergeant Amakasu!
-I am a Dragon Pilot.

16:29.697 --> 16:30.531
An ASDF official!

16:30.906 --> 16:33.993
-I will fulfill my duty without fail...
-You can't!

16:34.326 --> 16:35.577
And I will definitely

16:35.828 --> 16:37.037
come back alive!

16:37.371 --> 16:38.288
Amakasu!

16:41.291 --> 16:42.710
<i>Salamander has deployed.</i>

16:45.629 --> 16:46.630
No...

16:47.506 --> 16:49.133
That idiot!

16:54.638 --> 16:56.181
That must be it.

16:57.099 --> 17:00.853
Masotan, once I land,
you need to run, too.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.146
Understand?

17:05.482 --> 17:07.776
Masotan, eject!

17:24.334 --> 17:25.419
One, two,

17:32.176 --> 17:34.553
Hot, hot, hot!

17:34.636 --> 17:36.305
Now is the Ritual over?

17:37.723 --> 17:38.891
Masotan?

17:41.393 --> 17:44.188
What are you doing? Hurry up and leave!

17:44.980 --> 17:47.149
Why? You can't, Masotan!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.902
I want to protect you, too!

17:50.360 --> 17:54.990
Everyone is important to me,
but you're especially important!

17:59.036 --> 18:01.914
Am I possibly...

18:02.664 --> 18:05.042
a special, cherished person to you, too?

18:09.213 --> 18:11.924
That's foolish, Masotan. Foolish!

18:15.761 --> 18:18.514
I love you!

19:03.809 --> 19:04.810
What're you gonna do next?

19:04.893 --> 19:08.063
I've never thought of anything
outside of being a miko.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.064
We'll waste away.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.608
Look for an eternal job?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.527
That's impossible for you.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.488
I know. I'll be a florist.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.241
I was thinking

19:19.783 --> 19:22.619
the blooms would be nice.
The pretty flowers...

19:24.538 --> 19:25.956
in our future.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.379
With the end of Gifu's
mixed formation squad,

19:32.504 --> 19:36.884
today also marks the dissolution
of the Special OTF Flight Division.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.053
I'm going to miss everyone.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.639
You're leaving tomorrow morning, right?

19:42.764 --> 19:45.642
What souvenirs should I buy?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.060
Hey, Onaga.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.397
Shouldn't you ask her for her number?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.815
What are you...

19:52.941 --> 19:54.776
Aren't you going to tell him?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.946
Only if I'm asked directly.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.948
You like to hang them out to dry,
don't you?

20:00.032 --> 20:04.661
What about you, Lilikos? Not going to
exchange numbers with anyone?

20:04.745 --> 20:07.497
I guess I would for "Kingdom."

20:07.623 --> 20:08.707
Kingdom?

20:11.043 --> 20:11.960
I heard.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.923
That your extremely rude comments

20:16.173 --> 20:19.218
were all said to avoid anastomosis.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.595
You're going back to Tsuiki, right?

20:21.678 --> 20:22.512
Yeah.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.390
Sorry, but I'm kind of...

20:26.141 --> 20:27.976
I don't mind being friends with benefits.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.897
How can you say that, Hoshino?

20:31.980 --> 20:34.983
-Isn't that what you wanted?
-Hell no.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.902
Then what do you want to do?

20:38.695 --> 20:39.571
I want to cherish you.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.373
I'll think about it.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.754
Hell yeah!

20:57.464 --> 20:59.508
Hey, calm down, will ya?

20:59.967 --> 21:03.011
Your stomach will be flying low
if you stuff yourself!

21:03.804 --> 21:04.638
Kaizaki.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.265
Mr. Ikushima!

21:06.556 --> 21:08.517
You look like a true maintenance crewman.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.852
Yes, thanks to you.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.271
About that,

21:12.896 --> 21:14.898
could you give it another thought?

21:16.024 --> 21:18.819
As a result of creating
a junior size for you,

21:19.027 --> 21:21.613
Brand new possibilities have sprouted up.

21:21.780 --> 21:22.781
Suits for kids--

21:22.864 --> 21:24.866
I most certainly will not think it over.

21:26.952 --> 21:30.163
I've completely become an old person.

21:30.247 --> 21:31.873
You're as youthful as ever.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.920
To this lazy man that I am,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.339
will you sell a Joie?

21:41.341 --> 21:44.011
Sure. One million yen please.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.098
Ha, ha, you must have grown up in Kansai!

21:48.223 --> 21:49.266
No.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.893
It's really one million yen.

21:51.977 --> 21:52.811
Oh my God.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.647
Doesn't it feel too heartless?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.190
What is?

21:57.274 --> 22:00.235
Taking lightly
the loss of one of our subordinates.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.363
Commander Sosoda, Flight Leader Kakiyasu,

22:03.447 --> 22:06.533
and all the Dragon Pilots act
like business as usual.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.870
Maezawa has been reading
Buddhist sutras every morning.

22:09.953 --> 22:10.787
Shut up!

22:11.288 --> 22:12.914
Thank you.

22:13.373 --> 22:14.875
But we'll be fine.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.002
She is definitely...

22:17.336 --> 22:18.920
Hey!

22:20.005 --> 22:22.549
She's not coming home. How irresponsible.

22:22.924 --> 22:26.470
I wanted to chat with her
before heading back to Iruma.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.889
But it's been three months.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.807
I'm getting a little worried.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.268
Well, something'll work out.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.563
As long as she's got Masotan,
she's invincible.

22:36.938 --> 22:38.774
-Yeah!
-That's true.

22:38.940 --> 22:39.941
She's invincible.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.569
Even so, there's a least one person

22:42.944 --> 22:45.530
who can't sit still waiting.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.576
<i>National Land Afforestation Promotion</i>
<i>Organization and Toyama Prefecture</i>

22:49.785 --> 22:52.579
will hold on the ninth at Mount Arimine

22:52.871 --> 22:56.416
<i>the 71st National Arbor Day.</i>

22:56.708 --> 22:58.377
<i>The prefecture's Arbor Day began in 1971,</i>

22:58.460 --> 23:03.423
<i>and will be held here</i>
<i>for the second time in 47 years.</i>

23:03.840 --> 23:07.260
<i>Due to the bomb cyclone</i>
<i>on Mount Arimine back in March,</i>

23:07.344 --> 23:11.056
<i>major landslides struck the region</i>
<i>during rainstorms.</i>

23:11.181 --> 23:15.268
<i>Prefectural Governor Hyoue Yoshizawa</i>
<i>began a forestry recycling initiative--</i>

23:18.397 --> 23:22.234
According to the report immediately after,
in the land where Lord Mitatsu burrowed,

23:22.317 --> 23:24.528
Masotan's telemetry could not be found.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.864
I bought these for you.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.533
I burned through my savings.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.411
<i>But... they're definitely okay.</i>

23:33.537 --> 23:35.789
<i>For someone who only says the truth,</i>

23:36.081 --> 23:38.041
<i>if she says she'll come home alive,</i>
<i>she will.</i>

23:39.584 --> 23:42.295
<i>Besides, it's a bit of a relief</i>

23:43.338 --> 23:45.799
<i>that he is by her self.</i>

24:00.147 --> 24:01.982
Okonog?

24:02.065 --> 24:03.608
Amakasu?

24:03.733 --> 24:06.069
What are you doing here?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.071
That's what I want to know!

24:08.155 --> 24:10.240
-Where have you been?
-It's so good to see you!

24:10.323 --> 24:11.950
Have you been well?

24:13.368 --> 24:14.453
Yup. I'm doing well.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.455
Wait, no I'm not! Amakasu!

24:20.959 --> 24:23.795
<i>Because we're invincible,</i>

24:24.754 --> 24:28.633
<i>we'll find many more things to cherish!</i>

24:28.717 --> 24:32.971
