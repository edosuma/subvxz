WEBVTT

00:01.701 --> 00:05.405
It's time to pack up!

00:05.505 --> 00:10.510
Rachmaninoff will still
be there in the morning.

00:10.610 --> 00:13.046
I'm locking up in five!

00:15.281 --> 00:16.916
Goodnight.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.067
Whoa!

00:34.167 --> 00:36.202
Whoa, yeah!
- Oh, bubbly!

00:36.302 --> 00:37.871
Nothing's
too good for my lady.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.905
Oh, thank you.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.540
And what
better way to celebrate

00:40.640 --> 00:41.741
finishing your new book?

00:41.841 --> 00:43.843
Which is killer, by the way.

00:43.943 --> 00:46.279
Couldn't agree more, and I
can really see the character

00:46.379 --> 00:47.714
of Clodagh
becoming a fan favourite.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.349
You read the manuscript?

00:49.449 --> 00:51.184
He hounded me until I let him.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.753
A toast...
to "The Progeny's Puzzle"!

00:53.853 --> 00:55.055
- Yes!
- To Victoria!

00:55.155 --> 00:58.925
Aww!
Cheers!

00:59.025 --> 00:59.993
Mmm!

01:00.093 --> 01:02.629
Thank you so much, you guys.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.431
It really means a lot to me.

01:04.531 --> 01:07.067
This was a very challenging
book to write.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.102
It's a total thrill-ride.

01:09.202 --> 01:11.704
And your description of Monaco
was just so exciting!

01:11.805 --> 01:13.273
I actually want to check it out.

01:13.373 --> 01:16.443
Maybe a celebratory
vacation's in order?

01:16.543 --> 01:17.811
I'd like that!

01:17.911 --> 01:20.947
Hold on, didn't you say
you have an office in Monaco?

01:21.047 --> 01:22.115
Hmm?

01:22.215 --> 01:24.050
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you told us your company

01:24.150 --> 01:25.385
has an office in Monaco,

01:25.485 --> 01:27.620
last week, when we were talking
about Mediterranean food.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.322
Did I?
I-I must have misspoken.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.891
We've got an office
in Morocco, in Rabat.

01:31.991 --> 01:35.962
Yeah, you must have misheard.
It's an easy mistake to make.

01:36.062 --> 01:38.098
I guess.

01:38.198 --> 01:41.334
Oh, it's Grace Davis.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.902
Hi, Grace, sweety.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.904
Um, could I call you back later?

01:45.004 --> 01:47.273
Oh, no!
Oh, yes, of course.

01:47.373 --> 01:48.675
We'll be right there.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.477
It's Grace,
my pickleball partner.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.979
So sorry, but there's
been an emergency.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.848
Could we take a rain check?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.683
- Definitely.
- Of course.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.786
- I'm so sorry, honey.
- Duty calls.

01:59.886 --> 02:02.789
Come on.
I'll call you, Sarita!

02:02.889 --> 02:04.324
I'll just take this...

02:10.730 --> 02:12.532
It's a Gagliano.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.802
It was stolen out of this case
some time this evening.

02:15.902 --> 02:17.804
It's valued at $200,000.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.173
Whoa!
What makes it so valuable?

02:20.273 --> 02:23.042
It was hand-crafted by one of
the world's finest violin-makers

02:23.143 --> 02:25.678
Alessandro Gagliano, in 1729.

02:25.778 --> 02:27.313
There aren't many
left in the world.

02:27.413 --> 02:28.615
And the school owns it?

02:28.715 --> 02:31.518
No, it was on loan from the
Metropolitan Music Foundation,

02:31.618 --> 02:33.553
one of our main benefactors.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.088
One of the students
was supposed to play it

02:35.188 --> 02:36.856
at the year-end concert
on Saturday night.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.558
The violinists are
in competition to see

02:38.658 --> 02:39.659
who gets to play it.

02:39.759 --> 02:41.394
Grace, why didn't
you call the police?

02:41.494 --> 02:43.530
It's my hope this is a prank.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.832
It's a tradition among seniors
this time of year.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.901
Could be much ado about nothing.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.203
I want to quietly
solve the problem

02:50.303 --> 02:52.672
without the Foundation
ever finding out.

02:52.772 --> 02:55.175
If word got back to them
that their violin got stolen

02:55.275 --> 02:58.178
under our care, they'd
likely pull their funding.

02:58.278 --> 02:59.746
Hmm...

02:59.846 --> 03:02.682
Well, I don't see
anything broken...

03:02.782 --> 03:04.350
Who has the keys to this case?

03:04.450 --> 03:05.685
There are only two sets.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.154
I have one and my assistant
Eliza has the other.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.357
What about that security camera?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.059
The power to the system was cut,

03:13.159 --> 03:15.261
so every camera
in the school was offline.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.230
What time did
the system lose power?

03:17.330 --> 03:18.932
The footage cuts out
around 8 pm

03:19.032 --> 03:21.234
and I noticed
the violin missing at 9.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.169
Okay.
That's the window to our theft.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.971
Grace, you can count on us.

03:25.071 --> 03:27.173
We'll get that violin
back to you

03:27.273 --> 03:30.610
faster than Glinka's
Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.378
I'm gonna have
to Google that one,

03:32.478 --> 03:35.448
but it sounds hilarious.

04:00.807 --> 04:02.575
This is my assistant, Eliza.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.578
Victoria and Darby are going
to help us find the Gagliano.

04:05.678 --> 04:08.248
Oh, thank you so much.
It's just heartbreaking.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.049
I understand you two
are the only ones

04:10.149 --> 04:11.351
with keys to the display case?

04:11.451 --> 04:15.121
Yes, and we keep them
on us at all times.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.522
Huh, wow!

04:16.623 --> 04:18.291
Is that the list
you mentioned on the phone?

04:18.391 --> 04:20.593
Staff and students who
we know were here last night,

04:20.693 --> 04:22.228
but there could
have been others too.

04:22.328 --> 04:23.596
The one
I think most likely

04:23.696 --> 04:25.565
to have pulled off the prank
is at the top.

04:25.665 --> 04:26.599
Atticus Carr?

04:26.699 --> 04:28.935
He's a talented violinist
but a real rebel.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.537
He's been responsible for some
kind of stunt every spring,

04:31.638 --> 04:32.839
despite not being a senior.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.375
But now that he is, he might
have gone for a bigger one.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.977
Hmm, do you know where
we could find Atticus right now?

04:38.077 --> 04:40.580
He and his friends hang out at
the café just around the corner.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.448
Ah, the cool kids' hangout.

04:42.548 --> 04:44.817
Every school has one.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.653
What would you know
about cool kids?

04:46.753 --> 04:48.655
She was a hall monitor
in high school!

04:48.755 --> 04:49.656
Oh, me too!

04:49.756 --> 04:51.291
Rules are cool!

04:51.391 --> 04:52.992
We had an office.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.594
Whatever.
We're on it.

04:54.694 --> 04:55.962
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.534
Any idea where
Billy went to school?

05:01.634 --> 05:02.635
High school, no.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.404
His father was in
international finance

05:04.504 --> 05:05.938
so they moved around a lot.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.007
But he did his undergraduate
and grad at Cambridge.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.442
- I know that.
- Oh.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.944
And what does his
company do, exactly?

05:12.045 --> 05:14.314
Import/export, I think.
Why?

05:14.414 --> 05:15.615
No reason.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.684
I can just tell things
are getting sort of serious.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.285
Serious?
Never.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.520
Exclusive?
Maybe.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.822
And sometimes, when we're
in the heat of the moment,

05:22.922 --> 05:24.590
we can let passion
cloud our judgement.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.526
Oh, like when you thought
you could pull off

05:26.626 --> 05:28.227
that Miley Cyrus undercut?

05:28.328 --> 05:32.198
Wow, high school me is taking
a serious beating today.

05:32.298 --> 05:34.167
I'm just--
I'm a little worried

05:34.267 --> 05:36.536
that you don't really
know him that well.

05:36.636 --> 05:39.105
Knowing someone is about
knowing their character,

05:39.205 --> 05:40.373
not their résumé.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.508
Besides, we can't
all date hot winemakers

05:42.608 --> 05:44.010
we met in high school.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.645
To think...

05:45.745 --> 05:47.914
I had him at my
Miley Cyrus undercut!

05:48.014 --> 05:49.949
Mm-hm?

05:54.420 --> 05:57.990
I think those are the cool kids.

05:58.091 --> 06:02.395
- Hm.
- And yes, I would know.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.197
Excuse me?
Hi.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.232
- Um, are you Atticus?
- Yeah.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.134
Can we ask you a few questions?

06:08.234 --> 06:09.669
About...?

06:09.769 --> 06:14.073
Um, well, uh, my sister and I
are researching music schools

06:14.173 --> 06:15.441
for my niece,

06:15.541 --> 06:18.644
and Grace Davis told me
that you were a star pupil.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.712
Really?

06:19.812 --> 06:21.681
How do you like school?

06:21.781 --> 06:22.882
It's fine.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.017
One-word answer
kind of guy, huh?

06:25.118 --> 06:26.119
Yup.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.490
Oh, we heard about
your senior prank.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.025
It's the one time of year
we get to have fun.

06:33.126 --> 06:36.295
Huh, so I assume you have
a prank planned for this year?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.630
Oh, yeah.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.233
My last year's prank
on Maestro Oscar was epic.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.770
It was insane, right?
It was pathetic.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.139
Give it a rest, Olivia.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.476
We are an elite school,
we should act like it.

06:50.576 --> 06:54.213
Burnout.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.415
She's a snob.

06:55.515 --> 06:57.216
Doesn't think
I take music seriously.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.384
Hmm.

06:58.484 --> 07:02.021
Well, back to that prank.
How big are we talking?

07:02.121 --> 07:04.323
I want to get
Maestro Oscar again, right?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.058
But it's so hard to
sneak around his back.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.227
- He's always at school.
- Always?

07:08.327 --> 07:10.463
But he wasn't there
last night, was he?

07:10.563 --> 07:13.099
Sure he was.
Around 8.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.767
I asked him about
getting my bow re-strung

07:14.867 --> 07:16.035
just before the concert.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.137
Oh, for the big competition?

07:18.237 --> 07:20.540
Man, I really
want to play the Gagliano.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.941
Hmm...

07:22.041 --> 07:24.844
Um, anyway,
we should get to rehearsal.

07:29.348 --> 07:32.084
Atticus really didn't seem
to know the Gagliano's missing.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.921
- No.
- Who's next on the list?

07:41.093 --> 07:42.762
Ray and Jasmine.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.599
Two of the school's
best students.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.601
And they were on
the premises last night?

07:48.701 --> 07:50.670
Yes.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.141
Nice, guys!

07:57.343 --> 07:59.946
That was awesome!
Yes!

08:00.046 --> 08:02.982
Can we talk to you,
Ray and Jasmine?

08:03.082 --> 08:04.851
- Yeah!
- About what?

08:04.951 --> 08:07.820
Uh, well, my sister
here has a daughter

08:07.920 --> 08:09.589
that's a very talented pianist,

08:09.689 --> 08:11.324
and so we're touring
music schools

08:11.424 --> 08:13.459
and wanted to talk to
the best and brightest pupils.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.294
Oh, well, what
do you want to know?

08:15.394 --> 08:17.563
How often are
you able to practice?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.365
Is it just during
the school day?

08:19.465 --> 08:20.967
Oh no, it's all hours.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.803
We usually skip dinner and
stay to play in the evenings.

08:23.903 --> 08:25.705
Yeah.
Ah!

08:25.805 --> 08:27.807
Well, we heard about
the competition to play

08:27.907 --> 08:29.909
- the antique violin.
- Yeah!

08:30.009 --> 08:32.845
Yeah, and Jasmine's actually
the best violinist here.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.348
Well, Ray is gonna be
the next John Coltrane.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.852
You said you're often here
in the evenings.

08:39.952 --> 08:42.989
Last night,
did you see anything unusual?

08:43.089 --> 08:44.190
- No.
- No.

08:44.290 --> 08:45.892
All right, folks.
Let's wrap it up.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.159
If you're not in my class,

08:47.260 --> 08:48.828
please get to
where you need to be.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.429
Thank you so much
for talking to us.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.831
No problem.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.432
You must be Oscar.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.835
Or do we call you Maestro?

08:55.935 --> 08:58.037
But I guess then
you'd be Mister Maestro,

08:58.137 --> 08:59.739
and I don't know how that works.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.207
Quit while you're behind,
sweety, okay?

09:01.307 --> 09:03.409
- Okay.
- Oscar is fine.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.311
You're investigating
the Gagliano?

09:05.411 --> 09:06.679
You know about it?

09:06.779 --> 09:08.848
The sign in the display said
it was "out for cleaning,"

09:08.948 --> 09:11.050
but I happen to know
there's no 18th century

09:11.150 --> 09:13.786
violin cleaning service
in Alder Bluffs.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.855
I got the truth out of Eliza.

09:15.955 --> 09:17.490
Well, we've been
asked to be discreet,

09:17.590 --> 09:20.092
but I'm just curious--
which of the kids is on track

09:20.192 --> 09:22.461
for winning the competition
to play the Gagliano?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.897
Well, all of the students
are extremely talented

09:24.997 --> 09:26.465
and very hard-working.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.035
The top contenders right now
are Jasmine and Olivia.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.237
But not Atticus?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.538
- Atticus?
- Mm-hm.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.874
Uh, well,
he's very gifted...

09:34.974 --> 09:37.443
I'm not sure how serious he is.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.613
Or do you not want
to reward a prankster?

09:42.815 --> 09:46.385
I didn't enjoy being the butt
of the joke last year, no.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.288
Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised
if Atticus was behind this.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.824
Well, we're talking to
everyone who was on the premises

09:51.924 --> 09:53.659
at the time
the violin went missing,

09:53.759 --> 09:56.262
but you don't seem
to be on this list at all.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.930
Well, I left about 6.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.298
You did?

09:59.398 --> 10:00.733
- That's weird.
- Huh.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.135
Atticus said he spoke to you
about having his bow re-strung,

10:03.235 --> 10:04.437
around 8.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.571
Right!

10:05.671 --> 10:06.706
Uh, I did come back.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.274
Uh, I had
forgotten my briefcase.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.242
But it was only for a moment.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.777
Uh, if you'll excuse me,

10:11.877 --> 10:13.346
I really should attend
to my students.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.781
Sure.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.816
Interesting.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.884
It seems we caught
the Maestro in a lie.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.087
But would he really
risk his entire career

10:21.187 --> 10:22.288
just to steal the violin?

10:22.388 --> 10:26.092
He'd have to be
pretty hard up for cash.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.593
Yeah,
he's hard up, alright!

10:27.693 --> 10:28.995
I found his work history,
his mortgage,

10:29.095 --> 10:31.964
his custody agreement,
his massive debt.

10:32.064 --> 10:33.799
- Cold-pressed guava juice?
- Oh!

10:33.899 --> 10:37.670
My favourite!
Thank you so much!

10:37.770 --> 10:39.138
Oh, did you want one?

10:39.238 --> 10:40.539
No, I'm good, thanks.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.174
I've hit my guava limit
for the day.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.343
Okay.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.679
So tell us about
his massive debt.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.614
Right.
Oscar needed money badly,

10:48.714 --> 10:50.650
especially if he was going
to keep paying child support.

10:50.750 --> 10:51.851
Hmm!

10:51.951 --> 10:53.986
I assume you can't just sell

10:54.086 --> 10:56.522
a rare violin
at the local pawn shop.

10:56.622 --> 11:00.826
In your travels as an
"IT consultant"...

11:00.926 --> 11:02.795
where would someone go
to sell a high-end violin?

11:02.895 --> 11:04.597
Billy thought the Dark Web.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.033
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, uh... who's Billy?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.534
Oh, he's
the new man I'm seeing.

11:08.634 --> 11:09.635
Whoa, hey!

11:09.735 --> 11:12.338
Oh, did you guys see that?
There's a...

11:12.438 --> 11:14.974
a bee. Um...

11:15.074 --> 11:16.542
It's gone.

11:16.642 --> 11:18.844
Just...

11:18.944 --> 11:20.179
I'm bee-phobic.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.313
Huh!

11:21.414 --> 11:22.481
The violin?

11:22.581 --> 11:23.849
Yeah, if...

11:23.949 --> 11:25.618
well, if the violin's
on the Dark Web,

11:25.718 --> 11:28.287
I'll just poke around
and see what I can find.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.722
Okay!

11:29.822 --> 11:31.457
- Thank you.
- Yeah!

11:35.127 --> 11:37.329
Maestro Oscar needed cash.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.499
Plus, he lied and said he wasn't
on the premises last night,

11:40.599 --> 11:41.667
but he was.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.703
- That is so strange.
- I know!

11:45.805 --> 11:49.075
- Get behind me!
- What on Earth was that?

11:59.285 --> 12:02.655
There's not supposed
to be anyone in there!

12:07.159 --> 12:07.893
Whoa!

12:10.229 --> 12:13.899
Well, I thought we heard a bang.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.537
I can't believe this.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.439
How long has this been going on?

12:20.539 --> 12:22.141
A few months.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.542
Since my divorce was finalized.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.945
So, staff are not allowed
to be in relationships

12:26.045 --> 12:27.079
with each other?

12:27.179 --> 12:28.914
There's no official
rule against it.

12:29.014 --> 12:31.784
But why are you two fooling
around on school property?

12:31.884 --> 12:33.619
We have nowhere else to go!

12:33.719 --> 12:35.020
My brother lives with me and--

12:35.121 --> 12:37.089
And I live with my mom.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.291
She moved in
to help with the kids!

12:39.391 --> 12:40.526
Well, it's completely inappropriate.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.395
And it stops now!

12:43.496 --> 12:45.965
We happen to know that
you're in quite a bit of debt.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.800
We saw your alimony agreement.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.502
You went into my personal files?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.970
How is that even legal?

12:51.070 --> 12:53.339
I mean, fair point.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.274
Well, there's
no need for defensiveness,

12:55.374 --> 12:57.376
we're just covering
all our bases.

12:57.476 --> 13:00.312
You're on the hook for over
a quarter of a million dollars.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.715
And selling a Gagliano would
cover a lot of that for you.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.150
I would never do that, okay?

13:04.250 --> 13:05.518
I care too much
about these students!

13:05.618 --> 13:08.521
We just need the truth, Oscar.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.889
Okay, fine, fine.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.992
Yes, I'm...
I'm in debt.

13:13.092 --> 13:14.693
It's why I took a second job,

13:14.794 --> 13:17.096
teaching Mommy & Me
music classes on the weekends.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.031
Okay, we didn't ask,
but that's fine.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.432
Hang on!

13:20.533 --> 13:22.701
He couldn't have taken the
Gagliano because we were...

13:22.802 --> 13:25.237
together...
at the time of the theft.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.840
So you two
are each other's alibis?

13:27.940 --> 13:30.609
- I mean, yeah.
- I didn't do anything!

13:30.709 --> 13:31.977
Well...

13:32.077 --> 13:34.380
He may be telling the truth.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.082
I found this.

13:37.183 --> 13:38.517
Where did you get those?

13:38.617 --> 13:40.853
In your jacket pocket over
there when you were distracted.

13:40.953 --> 13:43.689
Imagine what would happen
if you were really distracted...

13:43.789 --> 13:45.958
Someone could have taken them
and returned them

13:46.058 --> 13:47.793
before you even
knew they were gone.

13:47.893 --> 13:48.894
Oh my God.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.696
Grace, I'm-- I'm so sorry!

13:59.972 --> 14:00.973
Thank you.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.710
Hey, I got your message.

14:04.810 --> 14:07.413
- Did Victoria see you leave?
- She didn't suspect a thing.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.914
Did you look into
Billy's business?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.216
Mm-hm.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.718
It all seems legit,
including his office in Morocco.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.119
Really?

14:14.220 --> 14:16.655
Well, emphasis on
the word "seems."

14:16.755 --> 14:20.559
Billy's online history
is very weird.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.461
Weird how?

14:22.561 --> 14:25.097
Well, his records--
birth, employment, education--

14:25.197 --> 14:26.565
it's all way too tidy.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.267
Still not following.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.436
People's records,
if you cast a wide enough net,

14:30.536 --> 14:31.604
are a mess.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.771
For instance,
when I ran your history--

14:32.872 --> 14:34.273
You ran my history?

14:34.373 --> 14:37.109
Yeah, of course. Look.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.878
Okay, so the Toronto
Public Library, right?

14:38.978 --> 14:42.281
They think that your name
is spelled "Darrby" with two Rs.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.283
And then there's the,
you know, dumb, shameful,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.584
embarrassing things.

14:45.684 --> 14:48.420
Like here, you were the
President of the Alder Bluffs

14:48.520 --> 14:50.456
Twilight Fan Club...
and only member!

14:50.556 --> 14:52.024
Hey!

14:52.124 --> 14:54.260
I almost got
the school librarian to join.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.228
Yeah.
Look...

14:56.328 --> 14:59.465
People's lives
are complex, right?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.567
They're full of mistakes,
full of secrets.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.269
But Billy's history
isn't like that.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.106
It just, you know, it's all
put together, like a story.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.841
Maybe he's just boring.

15:08.941 --> 15:10.542
No.
No, look.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.011
His name is never misspelled.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.646
DOB's always correct.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.114
There's no gaps
in his work history.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.649
He worked as a teller
at Barclays Bank

15:16.749 --> 15:17.883
while at Cambridge,

15:17.983 --> 15:19.752
then immediately
got a job in finance,

15:19.852 --> 15:21.120
and then upper management.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.321
There's nothing embarrassing.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.822
This all scans perfectly.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.158
So what are you saying?

15:26.258 --> 15:29.028
I'm saying his
history is crafted.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.930
It's not real.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.371
Hey, good morning!

15:39.471 --> 15:44.143
Oh, I see you invested
in a pair of sweatpants.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.211
But even with
an office in Monaco

15:46.312 --> 15:48.547
you can't afford your own robe?

15:48.647 --> 15:49.982
Morocco.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.884
And I could always
leave more clothes here,

15:51.984 --> 15:53.519
if that's what you'd like.

15:56.655 --> 15:59.358
I forget, Billy, where did
you say you went to university?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.527
I don't think I mentioned it.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.829
- Cambridge.
- Right, right.

16:03.929 --> 16:07.533
And you worked to put yourself
through school, at Windsor Bank?

16:07.633 --> 16:11.670
Barclays, actually.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.706
Trying to see
if I'm on the level?

16:13.806 --> 16:17.376
No, I'm just...
naturally inquisitive.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.811
Well, I get it.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.346
You're trying
to protect your mom.

16:20.446 --> 16:22.748
And although that's laudable,

16:22.848 --> 16:24.984
it's also quite insulting.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.519
To her.

16:27.619 --> 16:30.956
Victoria is not attractive
enough to warrant attention?

16:31.056 --> 16:33.192
There's gotta be some
kind of ulterior motive?

16:33.292 --> 16:35.394
Um, that--

16:35.494 --> 16:37.196
Honey,
Grace just called.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.665
She's got a new lead.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.067
- Hi!
- Hello!

16:42.167 --> 16:44.737
Let's go!

16:46.238 --> 16:47.940
- Wait, Mom?
- What?

16:48.040 --> 16:50.743
What are we doing, just leaving
Billy alone in the house now?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.478
I promise you,
he has no interest

16:52.578 --> 16:55.781
in your
My Little Pony collection.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.718
Grace?

16:59.818 --> 17:02.388
I received a note from
the school suggestion box.

17:02.488 --> 17:05.724
In the other recommendations
that I go "shaft" myself...

17:05.824 --> 17:08.494
- I got this.
- Hmm.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.262
"Charlie Morgan
stole the Gagliano."

17:10.362 --> 17:12.765
Charlie
is the school's caretaker.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.500
Huh!

17:16.201 --> 17:17.636
Charlie's not in yet.

17:17.736 --> 17:19.772
Feel free to look around.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.440
Okay.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.782
Huh, rubber gloves.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.051
Well, those gloves
could be used for cleaning.

17:32.151 --> 17:35.154
Or for not leaving
finger-prints on anything.

17:35.254 --> 17:36.588
True.

17:36.688 --> 17:40.159
Look.
A lock-pick kit!

17:40.259 --> 17:43.962
Maybe no one used
Eliza's keys after all.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.899
Let's check his computer.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.368
Look at that!

17:49.468 --> 17:51.970
He was searching
the Gagliano's value.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.139
What?

17:54.239 --> 17:56.141
I can't believe it.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.945
I fought to hire Charlie, even
though he has a criminal record.

18:00.045 --> 18:02.714
I truly believed
he was reformed.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.853
Grace?

18:07.953 --> 18:09.288
What's going on?

18:09.388 --> 18:11.957
The violin, Charlie.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.826
We aren't calling
the police at this point,

18:13.926 --> 18:15.360
but you have to give it back.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.496
Pfft, you think I did it?

18:17.596 --> 18:20.833
Grace, I love my job here.
I would never do that!

18:20.933 --> 18:23.402
Well, what about the internet
search for the Gagliano?

18:23.502 --> 18:24.503
Come on.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.939
No!
I didn't do any of that.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.875
If you found that there...

18:29.975 --> 18:31.176
I'm being framed.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.879
Framed?
Who would do that to you?

18:35.981 --> 18:37.549
I'm not sure.

18:37.649 --> 18:40.719
Is there anyone
on my staff I can trust?

18:40.819 --> 18:44.022
No...
No, Grace, please!

18:44.123 --> 18:46.358
I'm disappointed in you, Charlie.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.660
If the violin is returned
to me before Saturday night,

18:48.760 --> 18:50.229
I won't press charges.

18:50.329 --> 18:51.997
But you're fired.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.466
- No, Grace--
- Get out of my school!

19:05.844 --> 19:07.446
You know,
something's bugging me.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.414
I'm not convinced
it was Charlie.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.083
All the evidence points to him.

19:11.183 --> 19:14.386
I know, but doesn't it seem
a little too perfect?

19:14.486 --> 19:16.388
It's like we're
being told a story.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.657
All the pieces are just
lining up really easily.

19:18.757 --> 19:19.625
Mm-hm.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.593
Sometimes a cigar
is just a cigar.

19:21.693 --> 19:22.761
Schwarzenegger?

19:22.861 --> 19:24.463
Freud.
I worry about your generation.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.766
My point is there doesn't always
have to be a hidden agenda.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.737
Billy told me about
your conversation.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.272
Oh, right.

19:33.372 --> 19:34.907
Billy.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.442
I just think we should
be looking for more leads.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.745
The evidence
against Charlie is flimsy.

19:39.845 --> 19:43.448
Unless, of course, you have
lunch plans with Mr. Perfect.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.784
Hmm, no, I have
lunch plans with Sarita

19:45.884 --> 19:48.754
and that's right now, but I can
cancel it if you want me to.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.722
Oh, no.
Go do your thing.

19:50.822 --> 19:54.393
- Leave it with me.
- I will.

20:01.099 --> 20:03.702
Hey, what are you
doing right now?

20:05.671 --> 20:07.406
Are you ready
for some good news?

20:07.506 --> 20:08.607
Yes...

20:08.707 --> 20:09.808
I heard from the publisher...

20:09.908 --> 20:11.843
They love your new manuscript!

20:11.944 --> 20:13.445
They read it already?

20:13.545 --> 20:14.746
That is astonishing!

20:14.846 --> 20:17.282
Yes, and they want to fast-track
it through the pipeline

20:17.382 --> 20:19.184
so it'll be released this year.

20:19.284 --> 20:21.019
You'll be back on top
before you know it.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.588
Oh!

20:22.688 --> 20:24.122
Thank God, Sarita.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.625
You got your mojo back
and then some!

20:26.725 --> 20:28.860
Any idea what
turned things around?

20:28.961 --> 20:30.529
I think it's having
Darby back home.

20:30.629 --> 20:31.663
I feel more grounded.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.865
And us being
the Spencer Sisters,

20:33.966 --> 20:36.201
I feel inspired by
all these new mysteries.

20:36.301 --> 20:37.803
Oh!

20:37.903 --> 20:39.238
To the Spencer Sisters.

20:39.338 --> 20:42.341
The Spencer Sisters.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.643
Sarita, enough about me.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.578
How is it going
with the kite-surfer?

20:46.678 --> 20:48.780
Oh, he's very good.

20:48.880 --> 20:50.749
Once he's up, he stays up.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.018
I'll drink to that!

20:53.118 --> 20:54.953
Yeah!

20:57.656 --> 20:59.791
You want me to run
a background check on Billy?

20:59.891 --> 21:01.460
I'm looking
into him as well,

21:01.560 --> 21:03.428
but whatever's in his police
records would really help.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.197
Why, do you suspect
him of something?

21:05.297 --> 21:06.431
It's a gut feeling.

21:06.531 --> 21:08.333
Sometimes your gut
tells you to watch

21:08.433 --> 21:10.402
eight straight hours of
"90-Day Fiance."

21:10.502 --> 21:12.337
It's a good show!

21:12.437 --> 21:14.473
What's your point?

21:14.573 --> 21:17.009
Just maybe, in this case,
you could be looking for reasons

21:17.109 --> 21:19.544
not to let Billy in?

21:21.980 --> 21:24.049
I'm worried about my mom.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.218
Billy could be a hustler.

21:26.318 --> 21:29.354
He could be a con artist who
preys on wealthy older women.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.089
I don't know.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.625
What am I supposed to do,
sit around and do nothing?

21:33.725 --> 21:35.527
You could try
trusting her judgement

21:35.627 --> 21:37.896
and letting her be happy.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.200
I also need one more favour.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.304
I just need you to look into
this guy named Charlie Morgan.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.438
Seriously, Darby?

21:46.538 --> 21:48.073
The Spencer Sisters
aren't a trio.

21:48.173 --> 21:49.441
- This is for--
- A case, I know.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.575
I've heard this before.

21:50.676 --> 21:52.878
I just can't be at your
beck and call every time.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.913
But Zane, this could help
a wrongfully accused man

21:55.013 --> 21:56.348
get his job back.

21:56.448 --> 21:59.918
I just need to track down
some of his former associates.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.387
Fine.
This is the last time.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.256
Okay.
Last one.

22:21.873 --> 22:24.609
Excuse me, are you Elvis?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.479
Can I ask you a few questions
about Charlie Morgan?

22:27.579 --> 22:28.747
I ain't saying squat.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.315
You've got "cop"
written all over you.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.817
It's my walk, isn't it?

22:31.917 --> 22:33.585
I'm working on it.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.354
Anyway,
I'm a private citizen now.

22:35.454 --> 22:36.455
I'm a PI.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.489
An ex-cop.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.324
I know how you people
think about us:

22:39.424 --> 22:41.226
once a criminal,
always a criminal, right?

22:41.326 --> 22:42.794
I'm trying to help Charlie.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.464
I'm not convinced
he did anything wrong.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.470
Go ahead, then.
Ask the questions.

22:51.570 --> 22:54.806
Off the record, do you know
anything about a stolen violin?

22:54.906 --> 22:58.643
If our crew was still active,
which we are not,

22:58.744 --> 23:01.313
but if we were,
we would be bank guys.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.115
Not antiques dealers.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.317
Okay, and if you were active,

23:05.417 --> 23:08.320
would Charlie in theory
be back with you?

23:08.420 --> 23:10.288
Not a chance.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.624
He came to see if we knew
anything about the violin,

23:12.724 --> 23:15.994
seeing as I used to be
a well-connected guy.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.796
Well, then how come
he didn't defend himself

23:17.896 --> 23:19.831
when his boss accused him
of stealing the violin?

23:19.931 --> 23:20.966
Because who's she gonna believe,

23:21.066 --> 23:23.301
an ex-criminal
or some spoiled rich kid

23:23.402 --> 23:24.736
with lawyers on speed dial?

23:24.836 --> 23:26.138
Rich kid?

23:26.238 --> 23:30.542
Talk to Charlie
about the paper he found.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.277
I think we're done here.

23:35.947 --> 23:38.250
Framing the janitor?
That's crazy.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.018
Why would I care
about the hired help?

23:40.118 --> 23:41.987
Perhaps you held
a grudge against him.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.422
No idea what
you're talking about.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.690
Maybe this'll
jog your memory.

23:45.791 --> 23:48.226
This is the tip
that Principal Davis got

23:48.326 --> 23:50.996
in her suggestion box,
pointing her to Charlie Morgan.

23:51.096 --> 23:55.801
And this is a page of math
answers from a recent exam.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.736
Both are written on
the same kind of paper.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.171
What did you call it, Mom?

23:59.271 --> 24:00.872
Doublet Thoreau stationery,

24:00.972 --> 24:03.375
20 lb stock, in "linen."

24:03.475 --> 24:04.910
Very expensive.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.211
Where did you get that?

24:06.311 --> 24:07.546
Charlie gave it to us.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.881
A few months ago,
you hid this sheet of answers

24:09.981 --> 24:12.651
in a bathroom stall and went
to look at it during your exam.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.955
But Charlie had already
found it and he caught you.

24:17.055 --> 24:18.457
But he didn't turn you in
because, guess what?

24:18.557 --> 24:20.459
The help believes
in second chances.

24:20.559 --> 24:24.062
But you couldn't stand
that he had something over you.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.234
If Charlie would
have told anyone,

24:29.334 --> 24:30.368
it would go on my record

24:30.469 --> 24:31.803
and I would never
get into Juilliard!

24:31.903 --> 24:33.805
So, what, you heard about
the missing violin

24:33.905 --> 24:36.374
and then saw it as an
opportunity to frame Charlie?

24:36.475 --> 24:37.809
I just wanted him gone.

24:37.909 --> 24:39.611
Charlie might have
had to go to jail!

24:39.711 --> 24:41.913
And I might have
had to go to Yale!

24:42.013 --> 24:43.582
I've heard enough.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.051
First, you cheated.
Now this?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.053
Consider yourself expelled, Olivia.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.622
- You can't do this!
- Just watch me.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.524
And of course,
I will be re-hiring Charlie,

24:52.624 --> 24:54.459
with my sincerest apologies.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.795
One last question, Olivia.

24:56.895 --> 25:00.465
Where were you between
8 and 9 Wednesday evening?

25:00.565 --> 25:01.800
Visiting my grandparents.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.168
My family will confirm it.

25:03.268 --> 25:07.272
Right after they
sue this school into the ground!

25:09.040 --> 25:10.442
Charming girl!

25:10.542 --> 25:12.444
Delightful.

25:12.544 --> 25:14.713
And another dead end.

25:19.217 --> 25:22.087
Hey, got your voicemail.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.622
What's up?

25:23.722 --> 25:26.057
I know I was hard on you
about looking into Billy,

25:26.157 --> 25:28.226
but I need you to
hear me when I say

25:28.326 --> 25:30.595
I can't be looking
stuff up for you anymore.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.430
I hear you.
I do.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.666
Okay, I gotta be
thinking of my own career.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.702
No, I know.
I get it, totally.

25:37.802 --> 25:40.972
But did you maybe
find something?

25:46.711 --> 25:48.013
Thank you.

25:48.113 --> 25:51.516
I ran his name through
the system anyway, and in 2019,

25:51.616 --> 25:53.618
Billy West was pulled
over in Vancouver.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.186
He was almost
asleep at the wheel.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.421
Inebriated?

25:56.521 --> 25:58.189
They thought so,
but he passed two breathalyzers.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.358
Apparently he'd driven
straight from San Francisco

26:00.458 --> 26:01.693
and was barely awake.

26:01.793 --> 26:04.296
When police asked his name,
he said, "James West."

26:04.396 --> 26:06.097
But when they took his
license and registration,

26:06.197 --> 26:07.198
it said "William."

26:07.299 --> 26:08.466
- Weird.
- Yeah.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.302
They issued him
a fine for careless driving,

26:10.402 --> 26:12.170
but the officers
noted the name thing.

26:12.270 --> 26:14.339
What do you think it could mean?

26:14.439 --> 26:16.808
Either Billy
isn't who he claims to be...

26:16.908 --> 26:20.078
Or it's a slip from a tired guy.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.583
- I'm gonna need a drink.
- Yeah.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.194
What are we gonna do?

26:36.294 --> 26:37.562
About what?

26:37.662 --> 26:39.698
The fact that I'm
falling in love with you.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.070
We'll take it
one step at a time.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.172
Thank God
one of us has some sense!

26:49.341 --> 26:50.875
I gotta go.

26:50.976 --> 26:54.212
Oh, no!
Don't go!

26:57.515 --> 27:00.552
Well, sweet dreams.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.220
And I hope I'm in 'em!

27:06.358 --> 27:07.492
For an ex-cop,

27:07.592 --> 27:11.496
you have all the stealth
of a marching band!

27:11.596 --> 27:13.064
Oh, hey!

27:13.164 --> 27:15.100
Didn't see you there.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.968
I know you're worried
about Billy and me.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.737
You think that
we're moving too fast.

27:18.837 --> 27:21.640
But honestly, honey, do you
think I was born yesterday?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.375
No, that's not
what I was thinking.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.876
Uh-huh.
I know what you're thinking.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.045
Like something
out of one of my novels.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.880
A woman of a certain age
with a fortune,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.549
a man comes out of nowhere,
sweeps her off her feet,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.386
they have wonderful sex
in all kinds of places--

27:34.486 --> 27:36.154
I-I wasn't thinking
that last part.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.256
But that's not what this is.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.325
Billy and I have
a real connection.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.094
See, I know
you think that, Mom,

27:43.194 --> 27:45.830
but a lot of women do,

27:45.930 --> 27:47.799
and then they get hoodwinked.

27:47.899 --> 27:49.234
I just don't want
you to get hurt.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.736
You don't want me to get hurt?
Okay, okay, fine, fine!

27:51.836 --> 27:53.705
Look, if it makes you
feel any better,

27:53.805 --> 27:55.740
my lawyers have
multiple safeguards in place

27:55.840 --> 27:56.808
to make sure that...

27:56.908 --> 27:58.643
that there's no
hoodwinking taking place!

27:58.743 --> 27:59.811
Okay!

27:59.911 --> 28:03.114
I didn't know that,
and I'm glad you told me.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.183
It's good.

28:05.283 --> 28:09.187
Honey, I know
I have strong feelings

28:09.287 --> 28:11.656
about your love life,
but all I really want

28:11.756 --> 28:15.226
is for you to be happy
and to just live your life.

28:15.326 --> 28:19.698
And I hope that you can
just trust me to live mine.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.036
Alastair?
How'd you get in?

28:25.136 --> 28:27.439
Your acquaintance,
your, uh, boy--

28:27.539 --> 28:28.807
boyfriend, let me in.
Willy?

28:28.907 --> 28:30.475
- Billy.
- Yes, him.

28:30.575 --> 28:31.576
Okay, so...

28:31.676 --> 28:33.378
I found the Gagliano
on the Dark Web.

28:33.478 --> 28:35.680
It's just been sold!

28:41.152 --> 28:42.353
Okay, there you go.

28:42.454 --> 28:44.289
Someone with the handle
"Bach2TheFuture"

28:44.389 --> 28:46.324
is bragging online that
they're gonna pay $180,000

28:46.424 --> 28:48.460
to someone with
the handle "Equinox32"

28:48.560 --> 28:51.496
for an original Gagliano violin.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.364
Now, they already
put down a 5K deposit

28:53.465 --> 28:55.900
and the rest is gonna be paid
upon receipt of the instrument.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.002
That has got to be our violin.

28:58.103 --> 29:01.506
Can you access the real names
of the buyer and the seller?

29:01.606 --> 29:02.841
That's the point
of the Dark Web.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.209
Everyone has made up profiles;

29:04.309 --> 29:05.710
nothing connects
to the real names.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.112
Hmm.

29:07.212 --> 29:09.581
Well, could you look and see
if the buyer or the seller

29:09.681 --> 29:10.915
have posted anything before?

29:11.015 --> 29:13.151
Maybe that'll give us a clue
as to where they're from.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.219
Yeah.

29:14.319 --> 29:15.920
Ah, well,
the seller is brand new,

29:16.020 --> 29:17.889
but the buyer pops up
a couple different times

29:17.989 --> 29:19.390
and mentions Atlantic City,
New Jersey.

29:19.491 --> 29:21.159
Do you think that's
where the buyer's from?

29:21.259 --> 29:22.393
It's far away from Alder Bluffs.

29:22.494 --> 29:23.495
What about the payment?

29:23.595 --> 29:25.296
How does it work
if everyone's anonymous?

29:25.396 --> 29:28.666
Well, the buyer is gonna
send cryptocurrency

29:28.767 --> 29:30.034
to the seller's wallet.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.303
- All anonymous.
- Ugh!

29:32.403 --> 29:35.473
Why does the Dark Web
have to be so dark?

29:35.573 --> 29:40.545
Okay, how do you get your
money out of a digital wallet?

29:40.645 --> 29:42.747
You transfer it to
a regular bank account,

29:42.847 --> 29:45.917
or you would just take cash
out directly from a crypto ATM.

29:46.017 --> 29:48.353
Oh, the café!

29:48.453 --> 29:50.355
There was a crypto ATM there.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.024
I remember noticing it
and thinking,

29:53.124 --> 29:55.059
"What does that do?"

29:55.160 --> 29:57.328
See, she has such
an attention for detail.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.398
Oh, please!
Don't put this on me.

30:00.498 --> 30:01.733
This is all your
daughter's fault!

30:01.833 --> 30:04.035
- I know she's with your son!
- How do you know that?

30:04.135 --> 30:05.570
We haven't heard
one way or another!

30:05.670 --> 30:08.072
Everybody needs to keep calm.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.275
What is
going on, Grace?

30:10.375 --> 30:12.911
Jasmine's mother;
Ray's father, Daniel.

30:13.011 --> 30:14.579
Both kids called in sick today.

30:14.679 --> 30:16.281
And I explained about
the stolen violin.

30:16.381 --> 30:18.216
Nancy says Jasmine
was fine at breakfast

30:18.316 --> 30:19.918
but now she's not
answering her phone.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.920
We think we know why.

30:22.020 --> 30:25.757
This is security camera footage
from the café around the corner.

30:27.392 --> 30:30.395
We think they stole
the Gagliano.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.263
They took out a lot of money.

30:32.363 --> 30:34.632
And we know they were
on school grounds

30:34.732 --> 30:35.800
the night of the theft.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.435
- Oh, no...
- It's not possible!

30:37.535 --> 30:39.270
They're blowing up
their whole lives?

30:39.370 --> 30:41.272
Maybe that's the point.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.444
We're going to lose
our crazy strict schedules...

30:46.544 --> 30:48.112
- Mm-hm!
- Play music together...

30:48.213 --> 30:49.080
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

30:49.180 --> 30:52.383
- No more nagging parents.
- Nope!

30:52.483 --> 30:55.186
Oh, man!

30:55.286 --> 30:58.156
Hey, uh, where are we gonna
stay when we get there?

30:58.256 --> 30:59.691
We got money for a hotel.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.593
And when we finish the deal,

31:01.693 --> 31:04.095
we'll have enough
to live on for years.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.732
And we can rent
a house of our own, huh?

31:07.832 --> 31:11.502
Will people even rent
a place to us, though?

31:11.603 --> 31:13.605
Why the doubt, all of a sudden?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.139
I'm... I'm not doubting.

31:15.240 --> 31:18.176
It's just...
starting to feel real now.

31:18.276 --> 31:20.078
That's all.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.147
Trust me.
It's gonna be so much fun.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.315
Yeah.

31:26.918 --> 31:28.620
Nice!

31:28.720 --> 31:29.854
Thank you, Charlie.

31:29.954 --> 31:32.290
No, thank you.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.128
There's nothing in here!

31:37.228 --> 31:38.930
Except for a portrait
of this dude.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.965
John Coltrane.
Hmm!

31:41.065 --> 31:43.468
Remind me not to invite you
to a trivia night...

31:46.738 --> 31:50.341
Ugh, there's nothing
in Jasmine's locker, either!

31:50.441 --> 31:52.677
Where has your son
taken my daughter?

31:52.777 --> 31:55.213
Calm down, Nancy.
It's okay.

31:55.313 --> 31:57.382
Daniel, did you ever
have the feeling

31:57.482 --> 31:58.983
that Ray was unhappy at school?

31:59.083 --> 32:01.319
He gets to train with
the best musicians possible.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.855
I mean, every dollar
I earn goes to his education!

32:03.955 --> 32:06.090
I would have died for
this chance when I was a kid.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.592
But what about Ray?

32:07.692 --> 32:10.328
Is it possible that he doesn't
want the life that you wanted?

32:10.428 --> 32:12.063
He complains a lot
about early mornings

32:12.163 --> 32:14.766
and how he doesn't get to play
the music he wants to play.

32:14.866 --> 32:15.867
Anything else?

32:15.967 --> 32:17.535
He wanted to spend
more time with Jasmine,

32:17.635 --> 32:19.804
but I wanted him
to focus on practising.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.206
I've always thought that if
you have something special

32:22.307 --> 32:25.543
you have to pursue it.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.346
You think I pushed him too hard.

32:28.446 --> 32:32.083
Listen, sometimes as parents
we try to carve a path

32:32.183 --> 32:36.020
for our children instead of
letting them find their own way.

32:36.120 --> 32:39.657
Wait a second.
There is something in here.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.059
Look.

32:41.159 --> 32:43.061
I didn't know you knew
how to read music.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.562
I don't.
I'm reading numbers.

32:44.662 --> 32:49.133
1530,
1605, 1655, 1740...

32:49.233 --> 32:51.102
Important dates
in musical history?

32:51.202 --> 32:52.437
No...

32:52.537 --> 32:55.073
Those aren't dates,
those are times!

32:55.173 --> 32:56.541
This is a schedule.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.043
Yeah, but there's
no airport in Alder Bluffs.

32:59.143 --> 33:04.549
No, but we do
have a bus station.

33:04.649 --> 33:07.618
You want to ride with me?

33:10.254 --> 33:10.455
l speakers]

33:14.759 --> 33:17.729
Our new life begins now.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.900
Now what?

33:23.001 --> 33:24.302
I just...

33:24.402 --> 33:26.804
I think we're making a mistake.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.440
This is the plan.

33:29.540 --> 33:30.708
We're so close!

33:30.808 --> 33:33.211
Well, let's just explain
to everyone what happened.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.513
- Please?
- It's too late!

33:35.613 --> 33:38.049
No, but if we just go back,
we could fix it.

33:38.149 --> 33:42.487
No, I'm never going back
to that school, to that life.

33:47.358 --> 33:51.796
I want you to come.

33:51.896 --> 33:54.932
But I'm leaving,
with or without you.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.683
I wonder
what bus they're on.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.685
I don't know.
Let's look.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.821
Okay, Toronto,
New York, Philadelphia.

34:16.921 --> 34:18.289
I don't see Atlantic City!

34:18.389 --> 34:20.591
I'll check the ticket booth.

34:23.494 --> 34:24.962
Huh...

34:29.801 --> 34:32.170
I know this is
a super weird question,

34:32.270 --> 34:35.773
but do you happen to know
where John Coltrane was from?

34:35.873 --> 34:39.043
Yeah, he's from some
little town in North Carolina.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.145
Oh.
Damn it.

34:41.245 --> 34:43.614
But he did most of
his playing in Philadelphia.

34:43.714 --> 34:44.549
- Okay!
- Yeah!

34:44.649 --> 34:45.550
Thank you!

34:48.219 --> 34:51.322
I think they went
to Philadelphia.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.890
It leaves
in two minutes.

34:52.990 --> 34:54.058
Let's go!

35:03.334 --> 35:06.537
Hold the bus!

35:06.637 --> 35:08.906
Jasmine?

35:09.006 --> 35:12.376
Go!
See if he's on there.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.811
- Hey...
- Hi.

35:13.911 --> 35:15.213
Aw...

35:20.418 --> 35:21.619
Ray?

35:21.719 --> 35:23.121
The lady with the niece?

35:23.221 --> 35:26.891
We were actually investigating
the stolen Gagliano.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.326
Aw, crap.

35:28.426 --> 35:31.162
The buyer,
were they in Atlantic City?

35:31.262 --> 35:32.697
Uh... yeah.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.932
Well, he agreed to meet us in---

35:35.032 --> 35:37.935
meet me in Philadelphia
to complete the sale.

35:38.035 --> 35:39.370
Yeah, well, that's
not gonna happen,

35:39.470 --> 35:42.206
and you're gonna have to,
as they say, face the music.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.841
Yeah, no.
No way!

35:43.941 --> 35:45.276
No, that's not happening!

35:45.376 --> 35:49.680
Ray, do you really want
to leave your whole life

35:49.780 --> 35:52.183
and everything
that you've accomplished?

35:52.283 --> 35:54.285
That is not a life, okay?

35:54.385 --> 35:57.355
Those aren't my accomplishments!

35:57.455 --> 35:59.824
But nobody really
cares about that, huh?

36:01.626 --> 36:04.529
I mean, you've seen
what that school is like, right?

36:04.629 --> 36:05.963
They...

36:06.063 --> 36:08.633
they don't let me play
any of my music!

36:08.733 --> 36:11.335
I saw you and your friends
play that jazz piece.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.770
It was wonderful!

36:12.870 --> 36:14.906
Well, yeah,
because we worked hard on it.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.441
Outside of class.

36:17.542 --> 36:20.244
Tell me this...

36:20.344 --> 36:22.880
Do you think that you would
be able to play that well

36:22.980 --> 36:24.382
without the school's help?

36:24.482 --> 36:27.518
And all that practice,
it really paid off.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.521
You are
an accomplished musician.

36:30.621 --> 36:33.491
Yeah, tell that to my dad.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.626
He says I don't practice enough.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.195
Well, your dad...

36:37.295 --> 36:39.630
your dad pushes you too hard.

36:39.730 --> 36:43.768
But I think deep down
you both have the same dreams,

36:43.868 --> 36:47.405
just different ways
of making it come true.

36:47.505 --> 36:50.107
You should try talking to him
instead of running away

36:50.208 --> 36:51.876
from your problems.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.744
Ray, look, you're lucky.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.180
We have not gone to the police.

36:56.280 --> 36:58.382
You can make this all right.

36:58.482 --> 37:02.220
Just give me the violin.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.526
Jasmine!

37:08.626 --> 37:11.062
Are you okay?

37:11.162 --> 37:13.397
Where's Ray?
- He's on that bus.

37:13.497 --> 37:14.532
Wait!

37:14.632 --> 37:16.934
A little compassion
would go a long way.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.945
Thank you.

37:28.045 --> 37:29.981
I can't go home, okay?

37:30.081 --> 37:33.084
My dad will never forgive me.

37:33.184 --> 37:35.853
That's not true.

37:35.953 --> 37:39.390
Ray, I wanted for you
what I didn't have,

37:39.490 --> 37:42.827
but not if it makes you unhappy.

37:51.235 --> 37:54.071
Let's go home.

37:54.171 --> 37:56.807
Thank you.

37:56.907 --> 38:00.011
Hey, maybe I should
sell this thing and run away.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.646
You don't know
how to use TikTok,

38:01.746 --> 38:04.615
let alone the Dark Web!

38:04.715 --> 38:07.985
Besides, you'd miss me too much.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.677
So the rebel prankster
won the competition?

38:32.777 --> 38:35.913
There's no denying he has
heart and talent to spare.

38:36.013 --> 38:38.416
Thank you for returning
the violin on behalf of myself

38:38.516 --> 38:39.784
and the school.

38:39.884 --> 38:42.286
The Spencer Sisters
are always happy to help.

38:42.386 --> 38:44.455
I'm so glad you stopped
Jasmine and Ray

38:44.555 --> 38:46.624
from making a huge mistake.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.259
We've made some changes.

38:48.359 --> 38:50.161
Mental health check-in days
with the kids

38:50.261 --> 38:52.163
to help with the pressure
they're under...

38:52.263 --> 38:54.799
and we're implementing
a jazz program.

38:54.899 --> 38:57.234
Will Ray and Jasmine
be able to join?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.904
After their six months
of community service...

39:00.004 --> 39:02.206
If there's anything I've learned
out of this entire thing,

39:02.306 --> 39:04.942
it's that most people
deserve a second chance.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.311
And what happened
to the buyer of the violin?

39:07.411 --> 39:10.314
When Ray tried to undo the deal,
they disappeared.

39:10.414 --> 39:12.650
But there is the matter
of the $5,000

39:12.750 --> 39:14.352
that Ray and Jasmine received.

39:14.452 --> 39:16.153
They donated the money.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.356
New security system
for the school.

39:18.456 --> 39:21.158
It'll be monitored 24/7
by a security team

39:21.258 --> 39:25.329
led by one of the most
dedicated employees here.

39:25.429 --> 39:28.399
Oh!

39:28.499 --> 39:30.334
That's great.

39:41.112 --> 39:42.847
The evening's going off
without a hitch.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.583
Plus, the senior prank
wasn't on me for once!

39:45.683 --> 39:47.885
- Ladies.
- Yeah.

39:47.985 --> 39:50.454
Oh!

39:53.791 --> 39:55.025
That's good.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.102
Hey,
it's good you're here.

40:05.202 --> 40:07.204
- Hey, you found something?
- Yes.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.607
Okay, so I searched
various countries'

40:09.707 --> 40:12.209
facial recognition databases,
okay, for Billy's image.

40:12.309 --> 40:15.045
And I got a strong lead!

40:15.146 --> 40:17.515
That is Billy,
outside of a club in Dubrovnik.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.116
- It is?
- Yeah.

40:19.216 --> 40:20.918
And that there
is Nigel Westlake

40:21.018 --> 40:22.386
from Scotland Yard.

40:22.486 --> 40:25.122
Now, this photo was taken
when Billy was supposedly

40:25.222 --> 40:26.323
working in Copenhagen.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.559
Okay...

40:28.659 --> 40:30.494
Okay, there you have it--
Billy's a liar!

40:30.594 --> 40:31.796
Well...

40:31.896 --> 40:34.298
Sorry, that could be anyone.

40:34.398 --> 40:37.468
I mean, it could be Billy, sure,
but it just as easily could not.

40:37.568 --> 40:38.602
It's him!

40:38.702 --> 40:40.671
Alastair, if you wore
sunglasses and a hat

40:40.771 --> 40:43.007
and you stood in profile,
that guy could be you!

40:43.107 --> 40:45.242
No, it's...
it's definitely him!

40:45.342 --> 40:47.378
Billy has secrets, okay?
Very suspicious.

40:47.478 --> 40:48.979
Maybe he's a bad guy,
or at least he's not

40:49.079 --> 40:51.682
who he says he is,
and Victoria deserves better.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.951
You're pretty invested
in this, aren't you?

40:54.051 --> 40:56.053
What?
No, it's...

40:56.153 --> 40:58.289
No.
No... no!

40:58.389 --> 41:01.759
You care about my mom a lot.
Don't you?

41:01.859 --> 41:04.295
I...
Yes-- no-- I, um...

41:04.395 --> 41:05.830
That's irrelevant, okay?

41:05.930 --> 41:06.964
I'll tell you what's important.

41:07.064 --> 41:08.566
What's important is that Billy

41:08.666 --> 41:10.768
is talking to Scotland Yard, okay?

41:10.868 --> 41:12.436
Now, maybe Billy is a criminal

41:12.536 --> 41:13.838
who's gone into
witness protection,

41:13.938 --> 41:16.474
or maybe he's an undercover
MI6 agent gone rogue!

41:16.574 --> 41:17.875
- Oh my God.
- Hmm?

41:17.975 --> 41:20.044
Is this what
I've been sounding like?

41:20.144 --> 41:22.813
Okay, listen, Alastair,
I know I started this,

41:22.913 --> 41:25.282
but I'm done digging into Billy.

41:25.382 --> 41:27.885
I have to trust my mom and...

41:27.985 --> 41:31.188
...just let her be happy.

41:31.288 --> 41:33.290
And if you really
care about her,

41:33.390 --> 41:36.327
you'll do the same.

41:42.099 --> 41:43.534
I do care about her!

41:43.634 --> 41:45.469
That's what I'm saying!

41:45.569 --> 41:47.171
It is
a good one, right?

41:47.271 --> 41:48.506
Yeah.

41:48.606 --> 41:50.975
And keep in mind,
anything changes...

41:51.075 --> 41:52.877
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

41:53.911 --> 41:56.480
Why don't you join us
for some Malbec?

41:56.580 --> 41:59.016
Oh, Darby's more of
a beer kind of gal.

41:59.116 --> 42:02.486
There's a six-pack
in the fridge, honey.

42:02.586 --> 42:04.321
You know what?

42:04.421 --> 42:08.058
I'd love to try
what you're having.

42:08.158 --> 42:10.628
I'll get another glass.

42:19.136 --> 42:20.337
What?

42:20.437 --> 42:22.339
Thank you.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.241
The wine's symbolic.

42:24.341 --> 42:27.978
I'm taking a few sips
and then I'm getting a beer.

42:28.078 --> 42:31.515
It still counts...
