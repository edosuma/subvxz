00:40.871 --> 00:43.457
[beeping]

00:49.046 --> 00:50.881
[door shuts]

00:50.965 --> 00:53.300
Hi.

00:53.383 --> 00:55.136
What are you doing here?

00:55.219 --> 00:57.805
Can't a doting daughter
drop by unannounced

00:57.888 --> 01:00.016
to get bonkers with her beautiful mother?

01:00.099 --> 01:03.560
You're feeling guilty
for not giving me a job.

01:03.644 --> 01:06.355
Yes, I am. Drink up.

01:06.438 --> 01:08.524
Given the kind of guilt
you must be feeling,

01:08.607 --> 01:10.985
it should be a better bottle of wine.

01:11.068 --> 01:13.487
I'm pretty sure it's the thought
that counts.

01:13.570 --> 01:17.200
Jeez, Mom. Sad chicken?

01:17.282 --> 01:18.534
What? It's healthy.

01:18.617 --> 01:21.286
It's microwave dinner for one at 4:30.

01:21.370 --> 01:24.040
It's an edible suicide note.

01:24.123 --> 01:27.710
Come on, it's Saturday night.
You should be out having fun.

01:27.793 --> 01:30.046
Why aren't you out having fun?

01:30.129 --> 01:34.258
I'm here with my mother.
Yay! Fun!

01:34.341 --> 01:36.260
- Do you know what you need?
- Hmm?

01:36.343 --> 01:38.554
A boyfriend.

01:38.637 --> 01:41.431
I send that entire sentence back to you.

01:41.515 --> 01:44.018
Mom, I know you. You're happy
when someone's taking care of you.

01:44.101 --> 01:46.020
And you have someone to care of.

01:46.103 --> 01:48.731
You know, being a part of a couple,

01:48.814 --> 01:51.734
going on dates, subverting your needs...

01:51.817 --> 01:55.071
- All the things that you can't stand?
- Yes!

01:55.154 --> 01:58.282
- What about Mr. Bradley?
- Our old neighbor?

01:58.365 --> 01:59.825
Yeah. Where is he?

01:59.909 --> 02:03.453
Last I heard, he's in a wheelchair.
Minus both his feet.

02:03.537 --> 02:05.581
Okay, so not Mr. Bradley.

02:05.664 --> 02:08.417
But there has to be
someone out there for you.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.960
I don't know.

02:10.044 --> 02:12.421
That's because you haven't met them yet.

02:12.504 --> 02:15.465
Maybe I should just accept the fact
that I'm going to be alone.

02:15.549 --> 02:17.593
Oh, right, alone.

02:17.676 --> 02:20.096
Just act like I don't exist.

02:20.179 --> 02:23.348
- Oh, right. You already do.
- I don't mean alone, alone.

02:23.432 --> 02:27.270
I meant alone without a man,
not alone with you.

02:27.352 --> 02:30.355
I... I like you.

02:30.439 --> 02:33.192
- I struggle to believe you.
- I do, too.

02:33.276 --> 02:34.944
Where were you,
in a bunker in the sixties?

02:35.027 --> 02:38.572
That's where the rest of us discovered
you don't need a man to define yourself.

02:39.656 --> 02:43.744
No, you don't.
But you might like this one.

02:43.827 --> 02:45.370
You're serious?

02:45.454 --> 02:48.332
A dating site? Me? Oh, God.

02:49.416 --> 02:52.419
- Oh. He's handsome.
- And a doctor.

02:52.502 --> 02:55.172
A doctor of what? Desperation?

02:55.256 --> 02:56.715
[laughing]

02:56.799 --> 02:59.843
Can that happen
in your meditation room, please?

02:59.927 --> 03:01.887
With the doors open?

03:01.971 --> 03:06.433
What I'm hearing is, "Stay where
you are with the doors closed."

03:06.516 --> 03:08.894
Look at foxy Dr. Paul.

03:08.978 --> 03:13.023
Oh, God. I don't see myself doing that.

03:13.107 --> 03:14.942
Why not? Mom, I do it.

03:15.025 --> 03:16.902
I mean,
I've met some pretty passable guys.

03:16.986 --> 03:21.157
One of them had a micro-penis,
but the rest were absolutely normal.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.866
Yeah, and yet here you are
"getting bonkers"

03:22.950 --> 03:25.535
- with your mother on Saturday night.
- By choice.

03:25.619 --> 03:29.581
Well, I choose not to be murdered
by a stranger that I met online.

03:29.665 --> 03:32.584
- I choose life.
- Dr. Paul is not a murderer.

03:32.668 --> 03:38.507
His hobbies include cutting fruit.
Wait, really?

03:38.590 --> 03:40.801
No, that was a joke.

03:40.884 --> 03:43.304
Ha. He's funny.

03:43.387 --> 03:47.183
Make yourself a profile
and you can find out more about him.

03:47.266 --> 03:50.394
Without ever leaving your house.

03:50.477 --> 03:54.982
Or you could just spend the rest
of your life here with Frankie.

03:55.065 --> 03:59.695
Man, my bra is tight!
Ugh!

03:59.778 --> 04:03.324
Crap, I'm not wearing one.
[laughs]

04:03.407 --> 04:05.701
- I'll use my laptop.
- Great.

04:05.784 --> 04:10.289
There's a few things on my iPad
you probably shouldn't see anyway.

04:10.373 --> 04:12.208
Not porn.

04:12.833 --> 04:13.834
Yeah.

04:21.591 --> 04:25.054
So why are you hanging out here
on a Saturday night?

04:25.137 --> 04:28.349
Why is everybody asking me that?
Maybe I go out on Tuesdays.

04:28.432 --> 04:31.643
When I was your age,
I had two little kids...

04:31.727 --> 04:35.064
- Horrible.
- ...and a Buick station wagon.

04:35.147 --> 04:37.941
The first time I threw up
not in my own house

04:38.025 --> 04:41.111
was in the way, way back of that car.

04:41.195 --> 04:45.324
That was a big moment.
I'm so glad my car was there for you.

04:54.375 --> 04:58.795
- That's good.
- [laughter]

05:07.137 --> 05:08.847
I'm gonna try the chair.

05:10.682 --> 05:13.394
- It's great.
- [laughs]

05:16.439 --> 05:17.981
I don't ever want to get married.

05:18.065 --> 05:20.359
I'm currently advising against it.

05:20.443 --> 05:22.278
I want a man who's there
when I want him

05:22.361 --> 05:25.822
and gone when I don't and
is affectionate, not too much,

05:25.906 --> 05:28.533
and has great hair
and good hygiene.

05:28.617 --> 05:31.536
- You are describing a dog.
- I am?

05:31.620 --> 05:33.247
Yes.

05:34.623 --> 05:38.294
Oprah has a dog.
Oprah has... like, a bunch of dogs.

05:38.377 --> 05:43.882
I will give you $20 if you get a dog
and name it Oprah Winfrey.

05:47.052 --> 05:49.596
- [yells]
- Ah! No!

05:52.224 --> 05:56.270
Will you two not destroy
my house, please?!

05:56.353 --> 05:59.231
I'm sorry!
I thought we were destroying mine!

06:00.690 --> 06:04.903
Are you guys having issues?
I mean, more than usual?

06:04.987 --> 06:06.530
The short answer is yes.

06:06.613 --> 06:12.328
The long answer I'll hash out when I write
a strongly-worded letter to myself.

06:13.412 --> 06:15.205
How did you survive her?

06:15.289 --> 06:16.790
This helped.

06:16.873 --> 06:21.878
If you look past the icy exterior,
and the layers of walls,

06:21.962 --> 06:24.298
there's actually
an amazing woman in there.

06:24.381 --> 06:28.511
- Hmm.
- Still terrifying. But amazing.

06:28.593 --> 06:31.180
- Do you wanna see a cool video?
- Yeah.

06:32.515 --> 06:34.099
[Frankie clears throat]

06:39.646 --> 06:41.106
[laughing]

06:41.190 --> 06:44.527
Why are you laughing?
Why are you laughing?

06:46.111 --> 06:48.280
Oh, the phone's not on.

06:54.453 --> 06:56.121
Mmm!

06:56.205 --> 06:58.499
Oh, I know what I can put here.

07:02.002 --> 07:04.963
Was Larry's funeral really horrible?

07:05.047 --> 07:07.757
Wasn't great for Larry.

07:07.841 --> 07:10.052
Wasn't fabulous for me, either.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.095
Was she okay?

07:13.514 --> 07:15.682
I... don't know.

07:15.765 --> 07:18.685
- She's not exactly a big sharer.
- No shit.

07:18.768 --> 07:21.813
I'll tell you this,
your Aunt Lydia is no friend of hers.

07:21.897 --> 07:24.691
Uh, Lydia's a total bitch.

07:24.774 --> 07:26.735
- Uh-oh. Offensive word.
- Cunt?

07:26.818 --> 07:28.278
That's the word.

07:28.362 --> 07:31.114
You've been a way better friend
to my mom than Lydia has.

07:31.198 --> 07:33.325
Tell her that.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.369
No, not right now!

07:35.452 --> 07:36.995
I'm gonna check on her progress.

07:37.079 --> 07:39.623
I think I would have slept
with two guys by now.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.125
Excuse me.

07:46.796 --> 07:49.132
- Find a boyfriend yet?
- Oh, yeah.

07:49.216 --> 07:51.760
I'm already married and divorcing again.

07:52.761 --> 07:55.097
- Were you two talking about me?
- No.

07:56.181 --> 07:58.350
A little bit. No.

07:59.393 --> 08:01.395
Because I said something
the other day

08:01.478 --> 08:03.813
and she may have overheard,
but I'm not sure.

08:03.897 --> 08:07.817
She didn't mention anything.
Oh, I like that picture of you.

08:07.901 --> 08:10.446
- [Grace] I look so square.
- [Brianna] Yes.

08:10.529 --> 08:14.283
No, you can't say you're 70, though.
Say that you're 64.

08:14.366 --> 08:16.326
But I am 70. I don't want to lie.

08:16.410 --> 08:19.037
But you don't look 70,
you look 64.

08:19.121 --> 08:21.624
It's actually more honest
to say that you're 64.

08:21.706 --> 08:22.874
Okay.

08:22.958 --> 08:25.252
You didn't answer
"Biggest turn on in a man."

08:25.335 --> 08:27.588
- That he's not gay.
- Ha!

08:30.048 --> 08:31.883
Sorry.

08:31.967 --> 08:33.427
[sighs]

08:33.510 --> 08:36.388
You know what?
Write down "Open-mindedness"

08:36.472 --> 08:38.515
for "Biggest turn on in a man."
Guys love that.

08:38.599 --> 08:43.019
- Is that something perverted?
- What? Crazy... No, no.

08:43.102 --> 08:44.563
Okay...

08:51.403 --> 08:52.821
- [sighs]
- What are you doing?

08:52.904 --> 08:55.699
- You're done. Press "Send."
- If I press that button,

08:55.782 --> 08:57.075
everybody in the world

08:57.159 --> 09:00.370
who looks at this site is going to
know I'm a desperate loser.

09:00.454 --> 09:04.166
Yes. But Mom, they're all
desperate losers, too, so...

09:04.249 --> 09:06.502
I don't like any of my answers.

09:06.585 --> 09:10.005
Yeah, they suck. "Cultured"?

09:10.088 --> 09:11.923
You sound like yogurt.

09:15.260 --> 09:16.261
Mom?

09:16.345 --> 09:19.097
I am not taking you two for frozen yogurt.

09:19.181 --> 09:21.391
- Please...
- I will drive. I will drive.

09:21.475 --> 09:23.519
You're high.
You're not driving my daughter anywhere.

09:23.602 --> 09:25.770
You can barely drive
when you're not high.

09:25.854 --> 09:28.148
No, my reflexes are sharper
when I'm high.

09:30.609 --> 09:31.776
I get your point.

09:31.860 --> 09:34.070
- Come on, Mom. You're done!
- No! What are you doing?!

09:34.154 --> 09:35.531
It's my computer.

09:35.614 --> 09:38.492
Mom, please press "Send"
so you can wink at Dr. Paul

09:38.575 --> 09:41.662
and then we can go out and get delicious,
delicious frozen yogurt.

09:42.705 --> 09:44.373
I know what I want.

09:44.456 --> 09:46.375
No, no, wait...

09:47.459 --> 09:49.586
Now I know what I want.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.590
- Get in the car.
- Yes!

09:58.845 --> 10:02.265
What am I doing wrong?
It's side to side, right?

10:03.433 --> 10:05.728
You're out of cookies and cream!

10:05.810 --> 10:07.563
You're out of your mind.

10:09.272 --> 10:11.650
You're good at this.

10:11.734 --> 10:13.694
You should work here.

10:13.777 --> 10:16.405
- You should work here!
- Can we please go?

10:16.488 --> 10:18.532
This place smells like a breast.

10:25.330 --> 10:26.998
I still can't decide.

10:27.082 --> 10:29.209
Can I try the
Uber Fudgey Brownie Batter again?

10:29.292 --> 10:31.002
Yeah, of course.

10:31.086 --> 10:33.129
Oh, my God.

10:34.214 --> 10:37.133
Brian. I'm Brianna.

10:37.217 --> 10:40.429
That's, like, the same name
but without the "na."

10:40.512 --> 10:42.305
Oh, cool. What's your last name?

10:42.389 --> 10:44.933
Here, I'm done, I'm here.

10:45.016 --> 10:48.061
Let me pay, because I've got a sack
full of quarters

10:48.144 --> 10:51.231
I have to use up
and they closed my favorite Coinstar.

10:51.314 --> 10:53.567
- Hurry up.
- One dollar.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.778
- Two dollars.
- Come on, we have to go...

11:00.282 --> 11:03.452
- Honey, you're on the floor!
- Mom? Are you all right?

11:03.535 --> 11:05.579
- Don't move.
- We really should call an ambulance.

11:05.662 --> 11:08.998
What's wrong with you people?
Back up! Back up!

11:09.082 --> 11:11.418
I'm sorry,
you guys are blocking a fire exit

11:11.501 --> 11:13.336
and my manager, Heather,
is gonna freak out.

11:13.420 --> 11:15.756
- We should call an ambulance.
- What the hell, Brian!

11:15.839 --> 11:18.216
- Did you even call 911?!
- [Brian] She says she's fine.

11:18.300 --> 11:21.177
- Does she look fucking fine?!
- Just call them.

11:21.261 --> 11:25.223
- Hi, an old lady fell.
- Don't move!

11:25.307 --> 11:27.476
[ambulance sirens wailing]

11:28.893 --> 11:31.480
The doctor's reviewing your x-rays.
He'll be right with you.

11:31.563 --> 11:33.106
Yeah, you said that an hour ago.

11:33.189 --> 11:34.983
She means "thank you."

11:35.066 --> 11:38.528
- I'm gonna go call Mallory.
- No! Don't call Mallory.

11:38.612 --> 11:40.614
She'll make it a thing.
This is not a thing.

11:40.697 --> 11:43.074
- Okay, then I'm gonna get some ice.
- I don't need ice.

11:43.158 --> 11:46.119
Then I'm just gonna leave
for a minute because I have to.

11:48.831 --> 11:51.541
- Don't move. Don't move.
- I want some water.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.918
- You can't have any water.
- Why not?

11:54.002 --> 11:56.797
- In case you need surgery.
- What would I need surgery for?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.923
If, for example, you broke your hip.

11:59.007 --> 12:02.927
Stop catastrophizing.
I did not break my hip.

12:03.011 --> 12:06.473
You broke your hip.
Hi! Dr. Paul Mason.

12:06.556 --> 12:09.643
- Hello...
- [Frankie] She broke her hip?

12:09.726 --> 12:13.980
- Yeah.
- Oh, God, that means you have to operate?

12:14.063 --> 12:17.108
I mean, like all the old people
stories you always hear?

12:17.192 --> 12:18.652
With the surgery, and the PT,

12:18.735 --> 12:21.738
and the pneumonia,
and sexual assault?

12:21.822 --> 12:25.158
And it all ends...
you know how it ends.

12:25.241 --> 12:27.369
- Dead.
- You're going to end up dead.

12:27.452 --> 12:29.621
Oh, let's not worry
about all that stuff right now.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.248
What we want to worry about
is tissue necrosis.

12:32.332 --> 12:35.836
- Which is why I'm recommending surgery.
- Oh, honey.

12:35.919 --> 12:38.714
Now, once we get in there,
we can decide if you're going to need

12:38.797 --> 12:40.757
a pin or a rod or maybe even a new joint.

12:40.841 --> 12:44.010
I doubt it will come to that,
but if we do,

12:44.093 --> 12:47.138
do you have a preference
on titanium or plastic?

12:47.222 --> 12:49.892
Open-mindedness.

12:49.974 --> 12:51.810
Did she hit her head
when she fell?

12:51.894 --> 12:54.938
- I don't think so...
- No, I did not hit my head.

12:55.021 --> 12:57.649
I'm sorry,
is surgery absolutely necessary?

12:57.733 --> 13:01.152
I don't want to have surgery.
I've never had surgery.

13:01.236 --> 13:03.405
Not... ever?

13:03.488 --> 13:07.409
Not in the...
upper regions of your body?

13:07.492 --> 13:10.412
Like, say, up around...

13:12.247 --> 13:14.917
- like, there, maybe?
- No.

13:14.999 --> 13:18.545
- Are you on any drugs at the moment?
- I am not, but she is.

13:18.628 --> 13:22.382
She takes Boniva for osteoporosis,
Celebrex for arthritis,

13:22.465 --> 13:24.927
generic Diazepam for I don't know what,

13:25.009 --> 13:28.764
plus half a Sonata, Lunesta, or Ambien
to help her fall asleep at night.

13:28.847 --> 13:30.849
What, are you writing a book about me?

13:30.933 --> 13:33.017
- How do you know all that?
- Oh, I don't know.

13:33.101 --> 13:36.563
I tend to notice a person
when I live with her.

13:36.646 --> 13:38.732
I can't make out
your date of birth here...

13:38.815 --> 13:41.610
- I'm sixty-f...
- She's 70. Seven-zero.

13:41.693 --> 13:45.196
Once you hit seven-zero, the rate of
complications triple after a hip event.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.617
Also the chance of choking on a donut,
but we'll worry about that later.

13:48.700 --> 13:50.326
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

13:50.410 --> 13:51.453
Oh, God...

13:51.536 --> 13:54.372
She had some chicken at five,
and a glass of wine.

13:54.456 --> 13:57.542
Two. Two glasses of wine.

13:57.626 --> 13:59.878
All right. You sit tight.

14:00.879 --> 14:02.839
[old man grumbles]

14:05.801 --> 14:08.261
I have to have surgery.

14:08.344 --> 14:09.596
On my hip.

14:11.347 --> 14:14.810
That monster Heather
at that frozen yogurt place was right.

14:14.893 --> 14:16.812
I am an old lady.

14:16.895 --> 14:21.190
- I feel so awful about all this.
- Well, that's appropriate!

14:21.274 --> 14:23.902
I said I didn't want ice!

14:24.903 --> 14:28.490
Wake up. Grace? Wake up.

14:28.573 --> 14:33.369
There you are...
Dr. Paul wants you to suck on this.

14:34.496 --> 14:39.042
You have to suck on the inhalation nozzle,
and move the balls.

14:39.125 --> 14:43.005
Don't worry, I made a sex joke
about that and he laughed.

14:43.087 --> 14:45.131
He has a very nice laugh.

14:45.214 --> 14:48.217
Okay, here you go. Into your mouth.

14:48.301 --> 14:51.137
Come on. Suck the one ball.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.807
Great!

14:53.890 --> 14:57.477
Now suck the other ball.
Come on, two balls.

15:00.271 --> 15:02.315
Now suck the third ball.

15:03.900 --> 15:05.151
Pull. Pull.

15:06.402 --> 15:08.822
You'll do better next time,
but that was good.

15:08.905 --> 15:11.574
What time is the surgery?

15:11.658 --> 15:13.451
It's already happened.

15:13.535 --> 15:16.287
Don't you remember? Mallory dropped by?

15:16.371 --> 15:20.166
Dr. Paul wants you up and walking.

15:20.249 --> 15:23.920
With that? No. No.

15:24.004 --> 15:25.421
[Robert] Grace?! Grace?!

15:26.882 --> 15:28.842
- Oh. You didn't.
- I didn't!

15:28.925 --> 15:31.636
Oh, my God, Grace. Are you okay?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.805
Are you in pain? What can I do?

15:33.889 --> 15:35.431
Can I get you some pudding, or Jell-O?

15:35.515 --> 15:39.102
You can leave.
Why are you even here?

15:39.185 --> 15:41.855
Brianna called me. She said you were...

15:41.938 --> 15:43.565
You don't look like you're dying.

15:43.648 --> 15:47.069
So you own a lot of smart pantsuits.

15:47.151 --> 15:49.612
What you don't own is flow-y
broken hip clothing.

15:49.696 --> 15:52.532
So I dumped Frankie's
entire closet into this.

15:52.615 --> 15:54.576
You told him I was dying?

15:54.659 --> 15:56.953
She said that you were dying!

15:57.037 --> 16:00.623
- That is my concern.
- I am not dying.

16:00.707 --> 16:02.208
I'm so happy to hear that.

16:02.291 --> 16:04.753
Oh, you're worried about me.

16:04.836 --> 16:07.255
Of course I was worried about you.
Sol's worried about you, too.

16:07.338 --> 16:09.215
Yeah, I can tell.

16:09.298 --> 16:12.218
He's afraid of hospitals.
I left him in the car.

16:12.301 --> 16:17.015
He's afraid of getting sick in hospitals.
He actually really loves hospitals.

16:17.099 --> 16:18.349
- Really?
- Bud's like that.

16:18.433 --> 16:19.434
- That's true!
- You know,

16:19.517 --> 16:22.395
I have that same feeling sometimes.
I'm not always afraid of the hospitals.

16:22.478 --> 16:24.564
- But the diseases...
- There's a whole thing on NPR

16:24.647 --> 16:26.149
about how it's actually more dangerous.

16:26.232 --> 16:27.316
You never know these days!

16:27.400 --> 16:29.318
You know what you can do to help?

16:29.402 --> 16:31.529
You can all leave.

16:31.613 --> 16:34.365
Daddy, can you buy me some food
that doesn't smell like decay?

16:34.449 --> 16:37.160
Of course I will.
I'll get you some pudding.

16:37.243 --> 16:40.163
That's it. Keep it up.
You're doing great.

16:40.246 --> 16:43.166
Now you say it, "I'm doing great."

16:43.249 --> 16:47.253
I'll tell you what I'm doing great
at is keeping my hands off your throat.

16:47.336 --> 16:49.089
One more hallway and we're gonna rest.

16:49.172 --> 16:51.967
Two more hallways,
I'll give you a face massage.

16:52.050 --> 16:55.261
Three more hallways
and you'll let me have the beach house.

16:55.344 --> 16:59.307
Oh, look at you, all wise-cracking.
You must be feeling better.

17:02.560 --> 17:03.728
Cheater.

17:05.354 --> 17:06.230
[knocking]

17:06.314 --> 17:08.232
Dr. Mason's on his way.

17:08.316 --> 17:10.902
Why would Dr. Mason be on his way?

17:10.986 --> 17:12.569
Maybe he has a crush on you.

17:12.654 --> 17:15.198
Or maybe because I called him.

17:15.281 --> 17:16.866
What? Why?

17:16.950 --> 17:19.661
You forgot Mallory came by to visit.

17:19.743 --> 17:22.079
I was on drugs!

17:22.164 --> 17:24.373
You should know what that's like.

17:24.457 --> 17:26.667
- Wait a minute!
- Stop touching me!

17:26.751 --> 17:28.711
- But I'm just trying to...
- What? Help?

17:28.795 --> 17:32.715
You're not helping!
Helping would be not calling Dr. Mason.

17:32.799 --> 17:36.136
Or not getting high and dragging me
to frozen yogurt in the first place.

17:36.219 --> 17:39.931
- It was an accident.
- Yes, an accident I blame you for.

17:40.015 --> 17:44.186
I'm here, aren't I?
You want to be in this hospital alone?

17:44.268 --> 17:47.438
- Because they will kill you.
- Either they will or you will.

17:47.522 --> 17:50.650
You can be a real asshole sometimes,
you know that?

17:50.733 --> 17:54.154
Well, you're an idiot. You want to know
why your son has drug problems?

17:54.237 --> 17:55.279
Look in the mirror.

17:57.573 --> 17:59.742
Go fuck yourself.

17:59.826 --> 18:03.038
- I can't, Frankie. I broke my hip.
- [door slams]

18:20.638 --> 18:22.974
Hi, Dr. Paul.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.560
It's Dr. Mason. My first name is Paul.

18:25.643 --> 18:27.229
Oh, sorry.

18:27.311 --> 18:30.314
- Where's your friend?
- She left.

18:30.857 --> 18:35.945
Ah. Yeah. You've got this upside...
There you go. There it is.

18:37.321 --> 18:40.867
But before you get back to it,
can you count backwards from ten for me?

18:40.950 --> 18:43.369
Ten, eleven, twelve...

18:43.452 --> 18:45.163
Backwards from ten.

18:46.539 --> 18:50.501
[chuckles]
Ten, eleven...

18:50.585 --> 18:53.838
No, that's not... wait.
Ten...

18:54.881 --> 18:57.259
Sorry... Ten...

18:57.341 --> 19:00.929
I'm concerned that you hit your head
when you fell after all.

19:01.012 --> 19:03.431
To rule out any brain trauma
I'd like to do an MRI.

19:03.514 --> 19:05.391
No, no. I can't have an MRI.

19:05.474 --> 19:07.435
There's absolutely no radiation.

19:07.518 --> 19:11.022
You can radiate the hell out of me,
but I can't, I can't get into the tube.

19:11.106 --> 19:14.609
No, I can't. Please, please,
Dr. Paul... oh, Dr. Mason.

19:14.692 --> 19:16.485
Would you like me
to get you some Ativan?

19:16.569 --> 19:18.487
I'd like you to get me all the Ativan!

19:18.571 --> 19:21.574
No, no, no, I can't have an MRI!

19:21.657 --> 19:24.744
No, no, no, I can't do it, I can't! No!

19:26.871 --> 19:30.583
Squeeze the ball in your left hand
if you have any problems inside.

19:31.834 --> 19:35.255
- Wait till you're inside.
- [whimpering] Oh, oh, God, God...

19:35.338 --> 19:38.258
Ma'am, I know you're upset,
but I need you to stay calm

19:38.341 --> 19:43.888
or the images will be blurry
and we'll have to start all over again.

19:43.972 --> 19:45.598
I can't.

19:45.681 --> 19:48.392
- I ca- I can't...
- The first round will start in 30 seconds

19:48.476 --> 19:50.186
and it'll last five-and-a-half minutes.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.941
Wait!

19:55.024 --> 19:58.861
- Oh, no! Grace!
- Ma'am, you can't be in there!

19:58.945 --> 20:00.446
Patient's bill of rights!

20:01.739 --> 20:05.034
They told me about the MRI
as soon as I got back to your room.

20:05.118 --> 20:08.746
- I know how claustrophobic you are.
- Where did you go?

20:08.830 --> 20:11.249
I went to the cafeteria to get pudding.

20:11.333 --> 20:14.752
Oh, my God, everyone was talking about it.

20:14.836 --> 20:18.547
- I thought you left me.
- No! Why would I do that?

20:18.631 --> 20:20.716
You're so much fun.

20:20.800 --> 20:25.805
What I said about Coyote...
I was way out of line.

20:25.888 --> 20:27.390
Yeah, no shit.

20:27.515 --> 20:31.519
- I don't want to die.
- You're not gonna die.

20:31.602 --> 20:34.647
- I don't want to be alone.
- I'm here.

20:38.651 --> 20:40.362
Grace!

20:43.990 --> 20:46.117
Jeez.

20:47.369 --> 20:49.453
Are you okay?

20:49.537 --> 20:52.123
- I almost died.
- You almost fell.

20:52.207 --> 20:56.085
[sobs] Thank you.

20:56.169 --> 20:57.295
You're welcome.

20:58.338 --> 21:01.007
- Can I buy your yogurt?
- I already paid.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.509
Come on. Bring your big treat.

21:06.512 --> 21:09.224
Whoa. Oh.

21:15.479 --> 21:17.565
Listen, I...

21:18.900 --> 21:23.238
At Larry's funeral, I said something
about being stuck with you,

21:23.321 --> 21:26.324
- I don't even know if you heard me...
- Oh, I heard you.

21:26.408 --> 21:31.287
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- Yes, you did.

21:32.621 --> 21:35.083
But you know
what's worse than what you said?

21:35.166 --> 21:37.460
How you treat me.

21:37.543 --> 21:40.713
It's like I'm just some annoyance
you're forced to put up with.

21:40.796 --> 21:45.176
But guess what, I'm the other person
that all this happened to.

21:45.260 --> 21:48.637
I'm just like you...
but with a better personality.

21:48.721 --> 21:50.556
Well. Certainly bigger.

21:50.639 --> 21:53.226
See? Why can't you appreciate me?

21:53.309 --> 21:55.395
- I appreciate you.
- You do?

21:55.478 --> 21:59.941
Duh. I wouldn't have even gone
to that funeral if it weren't for you,

22:00.024 --> 22:02.360
and that would have been wrong of me.

22:02.444 --> 22:06.406
I would be apologizing to Larry's spirit
for the rest of my days.

22:06.489 --> 22:09.992
Like it or not, you're my friend.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.122
- I like it.
- Then make me feel it.

22:14.205 --> 22:18.000
I don't want to face
this crappy part of my life alone.

22:18.084 --> 22:20.044
Oh, your cookies and cream have melted.

22:21.379 --> 22:24.048
You don't like melty frozen yogurt.

22:26.217 --> 22:27.427
I felt that.

22:27.510 --> 22:29.095
[chuckles]

22:29.178 --> 22:31.473
But you still owe me
$5.16 for the yogurt.

22:31.555 --> 22:32.598
[laughs]

22:32.681 --> 22:34.309
In that case...

22:34.392 --> 22:37.479
- [slurps]
- [laughs]

22:37.561 --> 22:41.565
Jesus, Brian, how many people
have to bite it before you mop the floor?

22:41.649 --> 22:43.359
Sorry...

22:46.112 --> 22:48.864
Brian, you have wet nuts.

22:55.246 --> 22:56.372
Okay.

22:59.708 --> 23:03.421
Brian just friended me on Facebook.
It's kind of creepy.

23:03.505 --> 23:06.549
It must have taken a lot of work
for him to find me.

23:06.632 --> 23:08.843
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

23:09.927 --> 23:12.096
My life is a lot of sad chicken, too.

23:14.182 --> 23:18.019
Goodnight, Mom. I'm staying here tonight.
I'm too stoned to drive home.

23:18.102 --> 23:20.729
- 'Night, Brianna.
- [whispers] Be nice to her.

23:21.856 --> 23:24.567
- Good night, Frankie.
- 'Night, honey.

23:29.364 --> 23:32.450
Life is short, Frankie.

23:32.534 --> 23:34.785
You know what we need?

23:34.869 --> 23:38.581
We need a girls' night. Just us girls.

23:38.664 --> 23:44.003
We can have drinks...
and tapas... and just talk.

23:45.129 --> 23:46.964
I'm never getting a hearing aid.

23:47.048 --> 23:49.717
I think I'm better off
missing most of what you say.

24:01.354 --> 24:03.731
Let's see, did... Oh!

24:07.402 --> 24:10.112
Never gave me that Ativan.
