00:01.458 --> 00:02.958
- Freeze!
- No!

00:02.958 --> 00:04.666
This is Doctor Pershing.

00:04.666 --> 00:07.916
His enthusiasm outweighs his discretion.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.083
What do you have for me?

00:17.500 --> 00:18.916
<i>If I visit the planet</i>

00:18.916 --> 00:22.166
and I can bring you proof
that I have bathed in the Living Waters,

00:22.166 --> 00:24.625
then by Creed, I would be redeemed.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.416
There's nothing magic
about the mines of Mandalore.

00:27.416 --> 00:32.125
They supplied beskar ore to our ancestors
and the rest is superstition.

00:32.791 --> 00:36.625
"These mines date back
to the age of the first Mandalore.

00:36.625 --> 00:40.375
<i>"According to ancient folklore,
the mines were once a Mythosaur lair."</i>

00:40.375 --> 00:42.166
<i>"I swear on my name."</i>

00:42.833 --> 00:44.625
<i>"And the names of the Ancestors."</i>

02:02.833 --> 02:04.125
I am redeemed.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.250
BO-KATAN: I witnessed it.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.791
You bathed in the Living Waters.

02:09.375 --> 02:10.833
You are Mandalorian again.

02:12.416 --> 02:13.666
Can we leave now?

02:25.250 --> 02:26.791
Can I ask you something?

02:29.041 --> 02:30.083
What is it?

02:31.500 --> 02:32.916
You see anything down there?

02:34.208 --> 02:36.708
I saw the chasm passing me as I fell.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.125
I didn't realize it was so deep.

02:39.708 --> 02:40.750
BO-KATAN: It wasn't.

02:42.166 --> 02:45.500
The bombings from the Purge
must have triggered seismic activities.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.708
Did you see anything alive?

02:50.375 --> 02:52.125
Alive? Like what?

02:53.708 --> 02:54.791
Nothing.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.000
Let's get out of here.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.166
Bring me to my ship and I'll be on my way.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.625
You will forever have my gratitude.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.916
BO-KATAN:
I would invite you in for a feast,

03:34.916 --> 03:37.541
but I'm guessing
that helmet isn't coming off again.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.500
- This is the Way.
- This is the Way.

03:48.583 --> 03:49.833
We took a hit.

03:49.833 --> 03:51.583
BO-KATAN:
Something's coming up on us fast.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.875
It looks like a squadron
of TIE interceptors.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.875
How close are we to Kalevala?

03:57.875 --> 03:59.333
Not far.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.916
Get us back there
and I'll reinforce from the N-1.

04:01.916 --> 04:03.000
Can you evade them?

04:03.000 --> 04:05.958
BO-KATAN: Our shields aren't gonna hold.
I need you to back them off.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.708
Where'd they come from?

04:21.708 --> 04:23.708
BO-KATAN: I've scugged off
a lot of Imperial warlords.

04:23.708 --> 04:26.291
They tend to get mad
when you hijack their ships.

04:26.291 --> 04:27.541
Now you tell me.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.041
Get ready, we're comin' in hot.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.041
I won't be able to slow down for the drop.

04:53.583 --> 04:56.041
Interceptors are a lot tougher
than TIE fighters.

04:56.041 --> 04:57.750
Are you still up for the transfer?

04:58.166 --> 04:59.833
I don't see any other choice.

06:05.416 --> 06:07.875
I made it to the N-1. Heading to you.

06:17.541 --> 06:20.458
Don't worry,
I grew up flying these cliffs.

06:27.416 --> 06:30.000
Of course, it's been a while.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.666
Thanks for the backup.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.041
Two more to go.

07:05.541 --> 07:07.500
Go right. I'll meet you on the other side.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.666
One down, one more to go.

07:19.666 --> 07:20.750
BO-KATAN: On it.

07:51.541 --> 07:53.333
Not bad for an antique.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.166
You take any damage?

07:55.833 --> 07:57.458
Just shields. You?

07:58.333 --> 07:59.541
Not a scratch.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.750
Let's take 'em in just to be sure.

08:03.541 --> 08:04.583
Nice shooting.

08:07.333 --> 08:10.041
Hang on.
I'm seeing something on the scope.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.125
No!

08:33.416 --> 08:35.541
Those mudscuffers bombed my home!

08:52.083 --> 08:53.666
Bo, we've got company.

08:55.125 --> 08:56.375
Bo, listen to me.

08:57.041 --> 08:58.791
You have to get out of there.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.708
There's too many of them,
we've got to get out of here.

09:18.875 --> 09:21.208
That's a lot of ships
for an Imperial warlord.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.916
I'm sending jump coordinates.

09:22.916 --> 09:24.000
To where?

09:24.000 --> 09:25.750
Someplace they won't find us.

10:12.625 --> 10:14.958
I appreciate you letting me
speak here tonight.

10:16.041 --> 10:18.750
The Amnesty Program saved my life.

10:19.708 --> 10:23.791
There are many of us who had no choice
in working for the Empire,

10:23.791 --> 10:27.208
but now, the New Republic
has given us a second chance.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.333
So thank you.

10:31.083 --> 10:35.500
I believe that pursuit of knowledge
is the most noble thing someone can do.

10:36.750 --> 10:42.000
Sadly, my research was twisted
into something cruel and inhumane,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.916
at the behest of a desperate individual

10:43.916 --> 10:48.125
intent on using cloning technology
to secure more power for himself.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.375
But despite the shameful work of my past,

10:52.375 --> 10:55.875
I now hope to help the New Republic
in whatever way I can.

10:55.875 --> 10:59.625
Though that work is now behind me,
and I regret what I did,

10:59.625 --> 11:03.000
I assure you
that my original intentions were good.

11:12.833 --> 11:16.916
When I was young, I lost my mother,

11:18.833 --> 11:21.083
the person who I admired most.

11:24.583 --> 11:25.708
Her...

11:25.708 --> 11:27.333
Her heart gave out.

11:30.541 --> 11:34.291
Had simple organ cloning
been available on my homeworld,

11:35.166 --> 11:37.458
her death would have been
easily preventable.

11:39.375 --> 11:42.916
It was then that I vowed
to make it my life's work

11:42.916 --> 11:45.916
to help others avoid such needless loss.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.833
Thanks to the groundbreaking work
of the Kaminoans,

11:49.833 --> 11:52.958
we know that cloning
can duplicate an individual

11:52.958 --> 11:54.541
from a single genetic strand.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.041
What my work explored was the hopes

11:58.041 --> 12:00.541
of combining multiple strands
to create replicas

12:00.541 --> 12:04.375
that incorporated the best
genetic attributes of both donors.

12:07.791 --> 12:09.625
It's quite fascinating actually.

12:09.625 --> 12:12.875
The first casts rejected the formula
almost immediately,

12:12.875 --> 12:14.000
- but...
- Hello, Doctor.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.875
It must be wonderful
now that you work with a government

12:16.875 --> 12:19.416
that appreciates your contribution, no?

12:19.416 --> 12:21.666
Of course. I'm very lucky.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.666
And we're lucky to have you,
Doctor Pershing.

12:23.666 --> 12:26.333
How are you finding the city?
Comfortable, I hope?

12:26.333 --> 12:27.458
Yes.

12:27.458 --> 12:30.541
Though anything would be comfortable
compared to the Outer Rim.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.541
The Outer Rim, I can't imagine.

12:33.208 --> 12:34.791
You know, I was almost drafted.

12:34.791 --> 12:36.333
Imagine me, serving.

12:36.333 --> 12:37.916
Oh, darling, that was the Empire.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.791
Oh, my apologies.

12:39.791 --> 12:42.958
Empire, Rebels, New Republic,
I can't keep track.

12:42.958 --> 12:45.166
That's why
I should just keep my mouth shut.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.583
We try not to get involved.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.458
Well, I think
you deserve the very best, Doctor.

12:49.458 --> 12:53.208
After everything you've been through,
you're just so brave.

12:53.208 --> 12:54.958
And such an inspiration.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.208
I'm so glad you're working for us now.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.500
Thank you.

13:16.291 --> 13:18.083
I see you're going
to Amnesty Housing.

13:19.666 --> 13:22.083
Congratulations on making it
into the program.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.041
Thank you.

13:24.041 --> 13:26.083
Have you been in Coruscant long?

13:26.083 --> 13:27.250
No.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.875
Well, I think you'll find it
a very lovely city.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.750
You must be sure
to visit the Skydome Botanical Gardens.

13:32.750 --> 13:37.041
The Mysess blossoms are in full bloom and,
oh, my, oh, my, are they something to see.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.958
Ah. And if you have time,

13:39.958 --> 13:42.333
the Galactic Museum
has a wonderful new exhibit

13:42.333 --> 13:44.458
on hyperdrive technology
that is fascinating.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.208
And you must take a day trip

13:47.208 --> 13:49.291
to the Holographic Museum
of Extinct Animals.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.750
There are some
truly fascinating creatures on display.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.250
I found the mantabog
of Malastare to be utterly...

13:54.250 --> 13:56.125
Ah. Look at that, here we are.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.583
Amnesty Housing.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.583
Please watch your step
as you exit the vehicle.

14:02.541 --> 14:03.666
Have a good evening.

14:11.833 --> 14:14.583
Yeah. Said I was,
and I quote, "On the way up."

14:14.708 --> 14:16.666
Ugh. <i>Poodoo.</i>
We don't get promoted.

14:16.666 --> 14:18.250
No, you don't get promoted.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.125
Love it.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.750
Hey. Join us for a drink.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.541
Amnesty Officer M34.

14:37.291 --> 14:39.416
Amnesty Scientist L52.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.625
You're new?

14:41.625 --> 14:42.708
What do you mean?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.583
To the program.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.750
The pins, they make it hard to hide.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.875
Oh. Yes. I was just transferred
from the Re-Integration Institute.

14:52.541 --> 14:54.291
Welcome to Amnesty Housing.

14:55.791 --> 14:56.916
It's paradise in comparison.

14:58.375 --> 15:04.958
This is G27, M40, G68.

15:07.583 --> 15:08.750
Doctor.

15:11.625 --> 15:12.708
Everything all right?

15:14.291 --> 15:17.458
I didn't expect to see anyone
from Moff Gideon's ship here.

15:19.791 --> 15:20.833
Gideon?

15:22.125 --> 15:23.791
I didn't know you worked for him.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.916
I heard he escaped
en route to the War Tribunal.

15:27.916 --> 15:29.958
No, that was just a cover story.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.250
I heard they hooked him up
to a mind flayer.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.916
I try not to think about him anymore.

15:37.333 --> 15:40.708
Thanks to the rehabilitation program,
I can contribute to the New Republic.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.416
Just like you.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.500
Just like all of us.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.208
Long live the New Republic.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.458
Long live the New Republic.

16:03.208 --> 16:04.750
Long live the New Republic.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.583
Have a seat, Doctor.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.000
There are more of us here than I expected.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.958
Yeah, that surprised me at first too.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.833
It's not how the Empire
would have handled it.

16:27.791 --> 16:30.708
No. No, it is not.

16:33.416 --> 16:35.208
Yeah,
they weren't big on redemption.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.750
Have you taken in
the sights on Coruscant, Doctor?

16:37.750 --> 16:40.416
No. I haven't had the time.

16:41.416 --> 16:43.458
I'd be happy to show you around
when you do.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.791
Thank you.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.083
Uniforms did fit better.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.541
I do miss the lights of hyperspace.

16:52.750 --> 16:53.916
What do you miss, L52?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.041
Miss?

16:56.708 --> 16:57.750
From before.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.125
No. I'm glad that the Empire is...

17:01.125 --> 17:03.333
No, not like that.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.458
Of course, good riddance.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.333
I mean, more like the everyday stuff.
Like the food.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.208
Nothing?

17:12.916 --> 17:13.916
Um...

17:14.750 --> 17:15.833
I guess,

17:17.125 --> 17:21.083
maybe those, uh, yellow travel biscuits

17:21.083 --> 17:22.500
from the ration packs?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.875
- Yeah.
- Yes.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.791
- Wow.
- Ah, that brings back memories.

17:25.791 --> 17:28.375
I don't think you can get those
on the Core Worlds.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.083
Uh, no, you can't.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.916
Gotta say though, I liked the red ones.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.458
- You're crazy. Travel biscuits?
- What's wrong with them?

17:35.458 --> 17:38.666
I'm just saying, if I never see
another ration pack in my life,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.791
- I'll die happy. I'll drink to that.
- All right. Well...

17:40.791 --> 17:43.291
If I want something dry,
I'll just listen to your jokes.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.250
Mmm. Okay.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.125
Drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink!

17:48.125 --> 17:51.041
(ON RECORDING) <i>Thousands of layers
of buildings and skyscrapers</i>

17:51.041 --> 17:54.333
<i>cover the entire planetary surface
of Coruscant.</i>

17:54.333 --> 17:58.875
<i>Because of this, Coruscant is one
of only a handful of city-planets,</i>

17:58.875 --> 18:01.208
<i>known as an "ecumenopolis."</i>

18:01.208 --> 18:05.250
<i>Though Coruscant is often referred
to as the "center of the galaxy,"</i>

18:05.250 --> 18:07.958
<i>it's not precisely located at our...</i>

18:08.625 --> 18:09.625
One moment!

18:48.500 --> 18:50.000
Travel biscuits.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.583
Good morning, L52, happy Benduday.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.250
Another set for archival.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.708
Good morning.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.541
Oh, I saw your talk last night.

19:23.541 --> 19:25.000
Really interesting stuff.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.208
Oh. Thank you.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.833
Yeah, I had no idea
you were so experienced.

19:29.833 --> 19:31.708
Wonder why they have you down here?

19:32.583 --> 19:34.750
I'm happy to do whatever is asked of me.

19:35.416 --> 19:37.291
Well, you know... Oh!

19:37.291 --> 19:38.791
Excuse me.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.375
I'm falling behind.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.125
I'll let you get back to it.

19:45.125 --> 19:46.625
- Thank you again.
- Yeah.

20:06.875 --> 20:07.916
You're melting.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.125
Oh.

20:10.958 --> 20:13.833
It's just, um... so many people.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.000
It's all a bit overwhelming.

20:30.583 --> 20:32.833
A trillion permanent residents.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.791
Amazing.

20:35.458 --> 20:38.375
All these people working together
to make something better.

20:39.291 --> 20:41.000
It makes me feel rather insignificant.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.833
I don't know about that.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.250
Makes me feel special,

20:47.083 --> 20:49.500
knowing everything
I had to overcome to get back here.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.375
You've been to Coruscant before?

20:54.666 --> 20:56.250
I trained here, at the academy.

20:58.250 --> 21:02.250
Not much has changed,
other than taking down the cogwheels.

21:08.083 --> 21:09.583
It did feel different though.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.625
We thought we were doing good.

21:15.208 --> 21:16.958
I do think about that sometimes.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.541
All of my research going unfinished.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.958
We were close
to making some incredible breakthroughs.

21:24.916 --> 21:28.541
In the right hands, our discoveries
could have helped a lot of people.

21:28.541 --> 21:31.291
So, why not continue your research here?

21:32.208 --> 21:35.416
I don't think it's something
the New Republic would be interested in.

21:36.500 --> 21:40.041
The ethics of cloning are complicated.

21:40.708 --> 21:43.708
But if it could help the New Republic,
isn't that important enough?

21:46.708 --> 21:50.208
Following orders blindly is how we got
in trouble in the first place.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.791
Sometimes you have to trust your gut.

21:53.916 --> 21:57.375
The New Republic is trying their best,
but they're struggling.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.791
There are lots of capable people
who wanna help.

22:03.916 --> 22:05.625
Do you understand what I'm saying?

22:11.875 --> 22:13.000
What is that?

22:15.291 --> 22:19.958
That is the peak of Umate,
the highest mountain on Coruscant.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.458
They say it's the only place
on the entire surface

22:23.458 --> 22:25.500
where you can see the planet itself.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.625
How strange.

22:36.666 --> 22:37.750
You wanna touch it?

22:39.250 --> 22:41.666
- Are we allowed to?
- Allowed?

22:42.625 --> 22:45.625
Live a little, Doc. It's not the Empire.

23:03.375 --> 23:05.666
Please refrain
from physical contact with Umate!

23:05.666 --> 23:06.750
I'm so sorry.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.500
You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

23:10.500 --> 23:13.916
Sorry.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.000
No littering.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.083
Ah. Sorry.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.500
Let me buy you a photon fizzle.

23:18.791 --> 23:22.000
Ah, the look on your face was priceless.

23:38.375 --> 23:42.041
Do you still find your current
housing situation comfortable?

23:42.041 --> 23:43.166
Yes.

23:43.833 --> 23:46.500
Are you able to maintain
a consistent schedule?

23:47.000 --> 23:48.041
Yes.

23:48.041 --> 23:52.625
Are you experiencing any undue stress
due to work or personal matters?

23:52.625 --> 23:53.750
No.

23:53.750 --> 23:58.500
Have you experienced any feelings of anger
or resentment towards your coworkers?

23:58.500 --> 23:59.583
No.

23:59.583 --> 24:03.250
Have you experienced
any feelings of anger or resentment

24:03.250 --> 24:06.541
towards the New Republic government
or its representatives?

24:06.541 --> 24:07.666
No.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.875
- Thank you for continuing...
- Can I ask a question?

24:10.875 --> 24:11.958
Proceed.

24:11.958 --> 24:18.291
If I were to pursue my own research,
recreationally, would that be allowed?

24:18.291 --> 24:19.625
According to your file,

24:19.625 --> 24:23.333
your previous research involved
cloning and genetic engineering.

24:23.333 --> 24:26.875
That class of research is expressly
prohibited by the Coruscant Accords,

24:26.875 --> 24:28.958
Section 13, subparagraph seven.

24:29.541 --> 24:30.875
My apologies.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.666
Do you have any further questions?

24:35.833 --> 24:37.000
I guess not.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.500
Thank you for continuing to be
an important part of the Amnesty Program.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.708
Have a nice day.

25:12.208 --> 25:14.583
What we were talking about the other day.

25:14.583 --> 25:15.958
My research.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.583
I've been thinking about it.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.000
I know it's important,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.333
and in the hands of the New Republic
it can actually be used for good.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.333
I just need to prove it.

25:30.083 --> 25:31.875
Sounds like you wanna continue it.

25:32.541 --> 25:35.166
But... I mean, how?

25:36.291 --> 25:37.458
What do you need?

25:39.125 --> 25:40.750
Well, not much to get started.

25:40.875 --> 25:44.375
Um, some supplies, a mobile lab station?

25:45.583 --> 25:47.083
It's a silly idea, I know it is,

25:47.083 --> 25:48.666
- but I really believe that...
- Stop.

25:50.041 --> 25:54.208
You wanna help the New Republic,
they just can't see it yet.

25:58.916 --> 26:00.875
We can get you a mobile lab station.

26:04.666 --> 26:07.750
But it would require going outside
our designated perimeter.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.250
No. I can't... I can't do that.

26:15.583 --> 26:19.083
If they found out we'd both be sent back
to the Re-Integration Institute.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.041
Look...

26:25.375 --> 26:27.708
I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.416
I have a lot to make up for.

26:35.666 --> 26:38.750
But if your research really
is as important as you say,

26:39.791 --> 26:41.458
I'll take that risk.

26:52.791 --> 26:54.000
It's too dangerous.

27:00.875 --> 27:06.958
Well, just, uh... sleep on it, okay?

27:34.916 --> 27:37.000
Good morning, L52. Everything okay?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.041
Yes. Thank you.

27:39.041 --> 27:43.458
But this, uh, equipment I'm archiving,
it's all coded to be destroyed.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.125
Looks like it.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.291
But it's all still perfectly good.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.500
It's Imperial technology.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.125
Yes, but it can still be put to good use.

27:54.125 --> 27:57.458
If I can have access to the equipment,
I'd be happy to demonstrate how...

27:57.458 --> 27:58.958
Can I be honest with you?

27:58.958 --> 28:00.833
We are really behind here.

28:00.833 --> 28:04.291
Not only do we have
the Imperial disposal yards to inventory

28:04.291 --> 28:06.500
but we're still decommissioning
the Alliance fleet.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.791
I'm sure you understand.

28:07.791 --> 28:09.750
I just think I could be helpful
if I could...

28:09.750 --> 28:12.375
It would require authorization
from the department.

28:12.375 --> 28:15.791
You could submit a C-1023 request,

28:15.791 --> 28:18.541
but I've never seen someone
from the Amnesty Program make one.

28:18.541 --> 28:20.375
I'd have to check if that's even possible.

28:20.375 --> 28:21.541
It's fine.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.666
Forget I asked.

28:23.666 --> 28:26.041
I'm sorry, L52.

28:26.041 --> 28:27.583
I know it's not easy,

28:27.583 --> 28:31.875
but I assure you
this is truly helping the New Republic.

28:37.875 --> 28:38.875
Morning.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.000
<i>Are you experiencing any undue stress</i>

28:50.000 --> 28:52.291
<i>due to work or personal matters?</i>

28:52.291 --> 28:53.625
<i>No.</i>

28:54.666 --> 28:59.291
Have you experienced any feelings of anger
or resentment towards your co-workers?

28:59.291 --> 29:00.375
No.

29:00.375 --> 29:03.708
Have you experienced
any feelings of anger or resentment

29:03.708 --> 29:07.166
towards the New Republic government
or its representatives?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.375
Apologies if you didn't hear me.

29:13.166 --> 29:16.083
Have you experienced
any feelings of anger or resentment...

29:16.083 --> 29:17.208
No.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.791
Thank you for continuing to be...

29:18.791 --> 29:22.291
Our main objective
is to help the Republic, right?

29:22.291 --> 29:23.375
Correct.

29:23.375 --> 29:25.500
And that supersedes everything else?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.875
It does.

29:29.500 --> 29:34.375
Thank you for continuing to be
an important part of the Amnesty Program.

29:34.375 --> 29:35.666
Have a nice day.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.375
The mobile lab station, let's go get it.

29:58.833 --> 29:59.833
Good.

30:02.666 --> 30:03.791
Tomorrow night?

30:30.541 --> 30:32.166
You're helping the New Republic.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.166
It's the right thing to do.

30:56.166 --> 30:57.208
Relax.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.541
Just follow my lead.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.791
Take a deep breath, Doc.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.291
It's gonna be fine.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.625
Remember why we're doing this.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.416
Keep it together, Doc.

31:33.541 --> 31:35.916
You're better at this than I am.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.125
Oh, you'll get the hang of it.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.875
Taungsdays, am I right?

33:14.916 --> 33:16.625
Where are we going?

33:17.708 --> 33:18.958
The disposal yards.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.458
You know, the inventory you're cataloging.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.625
What?

33:24.291 --> 33:26.791
Imperial ships will have
mobile lab stations, right?

33:26.791 --> 33:29.416
They do, but they're Imperial.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.666
Well, not anymore.

33:32.791 --> 33:34.000
Now they're just junk.

33:35.541 --> 33:37.166
Look, we slip in, grab what you need,

33:37.166 --> 33:39.625
and we're back at Amnesty Housing
before you know it.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.875
Have you done this before?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.250
Where do you think I got the biscuits?

34:35.583 --> 34:38.125
Tickets, please. Tickets, please.

34:38.666 --> 34:39.958
- Thank you.
- Follow me.

34:41.750 --> 34:42.833
Tickets, please.

34:51.208 --> 34:52.333
Tickets, please.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.500
Go ahead. I'm right behind you.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.583
You can do it.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.333
Nice, Doc.

35:10.333 --> 35:11.625
Thank you.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.833
Keep moving.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.541
Taungsdays, am I right?

35:30.166 --> 35:31.833
We'll work on that.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.708
- Sorry.
- Watch it!

36:15.416 --> 36:17.000
It's the end of the train.

36:19.041 --> 36:22.250
(ON PA) <i>Approaching
Shipyard Depot, first station.</i>

36:25.208 --> 36:26.500
We're gonna jump.

36:27.666 --> 36:28.833
What?

36:36.416 --> 36:37.500
Trust me.

36:47.375 --> 36:49.708
<i>Now arriving, Shipyard Depot.</i>

36:50.583 --> 36:51.708
- And...
- Uh...

36:56.333 --> 36:57.625
Now!

37:56.583 --> 37:58.458
Never done anything like this before.

38:34.125 --> 38:35.166
Huh?

38:47.416 --> 38:48.666
You sure we're alone?

38:49.208 --> 38:50.208
Yep.

38:51.041 --> 38:52.750
Ships are all inoperable.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.041
No need to guard 'em.

40:09.041 --> 40:11.916
I must have passed you
on Gideon's ship a hundred times.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.333
Sorry I never introduced myself.

40:18.041 --> 40:21.208
I, uh... You don't have to apologize.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.166
That's not how things were back then.

40:25.416 --> 40:26.416
No.

40:28.875 --> 40:30.000
Now it is.

40:32.208 --> 40:35.125
Elia Kane, Communications Officer.

40:39.458 --> 40:42.625
Doctor Penn Pershing, Scientist.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.708
Nice to meet you, Doctor Pershing.

40:50.666 --> 40:51.750
Here it is.

41:12.916 --> 41:14.250
Is everything you need here?

41:15.166 --> 41:16.375
This is perfect.

41:21.125 --> 41:23.083
I'll only take what I need.

41:24.083 --> 41:25.458
It's all going to the scrap heap.

41:28.166 --> 41:31.208
I remember the first time
I was in a place like this,

41:32.125 --> 41:33.458
I couldn't believe I'd made it.

41:35.041 --> 41:38.125
My mother was a doctor
in the town where I grew up.

41:38.125 --> 41:41.666
I would spend days in her office
dreaming of a lab like this.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.041
But to actually be in one...

41:45.625 --> 41:47.541
You always knew what you wanted to do.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.250
As far back as I can remember.

41:53.083 --> 41:54.208
What about you?

41:55.208 --> 41:56.875
What did you wanna be when you grew up?

42:00.708 --> 42:02.833
I didn't really have
a chance to think about it.

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
What was that?

42:11.166 --> 42:12.375
Just the ship settling.

42:13.208 --> 42:14.291
Keep packing.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.666
I'll keep watch, just in case.

42:43.083 --> 42:44.291
How do we get back?

43:16.291 --> 43:17.416
Keep moving!

43:35.000 --> 43:36.125
Stop!

43:37.916 --> 43:41.750
Amnesty Scientist L52,
raise your hands, you are under arrest.

44:08.916 --> 44:10.291
Wait.

44:10.958 --> 44:12.500
Raise your hands, L52.

44:15.833 --> 44:19.208
Just wait. Wait. Wait...

44:19.208 --> 44:20.875
No!

44:25.750 --> 44:27.458
Good morning, Doctor.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.166
Listen, I can explain.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.291
- I wasn't trying...
- No need.

44:31.291 --> 44:35.583
Amnesty Officer G68
has already submitted a report.

44:37.583 --> 44:38.625
What?

44:40.500 --> 44:41.750
What did she tell you?

44:41.750 --> 44:44.000
We understand
that the adjustment can be difficult.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.250
No, no, no.
I think there's been a mistake,

44:46.250 --> 44:47.916
- I wasn't...
- We're here to help you.

44:47.916 --> 44:51.250
Indoctrination by the Empire
is challenging to overcome.

44:51.250 --> 44:54.958
Uh...

44:54.958 --> 44:57.708
Wait, uh... This is a mind flayer.

44:57.708 --> 44:59.833
This is a Six-O-Two Mitigator.

44:59.833 --> 45:01.791
It's a non-invasive
experimental treatment,

45:01.791 --> 45:03.541
recently approved for rehabilitation.

45:03.541 --> 45:05.166
No, it's a mind flayer.

45:05.166 --> 45:07.041
It's a similar device,

45:07.041 --> 45:08.541
but we've found at low voltages

45:08.541 --> 45:11.583
it can be used to help soothe
select traumatic memories.

45:13.791 --> 45:15.375
You'll see some pleasant colors,

45:15.375 --> 45:16.458
hear a light buzzing,

45:16.458 --> 45:19.333
and experience a great sense
of relief in no time at all.

45:19.333 --> 45:21.791
- You're gonna wipe my mind.
- Absolutely not!

45:21.791 --> 45:23.458
This isn't the Empire, son.

45:23.458 --> 45:25.416
This device is used to heal.

45:25.416 --> 45:28.666
I've been through the treatment myself,
I found it quite refreshing.

45:28.666 --> 45:30.250
Please, just let me explain.

45:30.250 --> 45:31.541
I was just trying to help.

45:33.416 --> 45:34.916
This will only take a moment.

45:36.375 --> 45:37.875
I'll be here when you wake up.

45:37.875 --> 45:39.625
You don't understand.

45:39.625 --> 45:42.083
She brought me there. It was a trap.

45:43.250 --> 45:45.166
Please, I just wanted to help.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.750
She set me up. Please.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.416
You set me up.

45:51.083 --> 45:52.125
You set me up.

45:54.625 --> 45:56.000
Why did you set me up?

45:58.125 --> 45:59.250
Please...

46:06.250 --> 46:08.333
I thought
he was doing so well.

46:09.708 --> 46:11.125
You've done the right thing.

46:12.708 --> 46:13.833
Thanks.

46:15.375 --> 46:16.791
I know this will help him.

46:17.708 --> 46:18.791
It will.

46:19.750 --> 46:22.500
You are a real credit to this program.

46:22.500 --> 46:26.791
It's nice to know that for every failure,
there's a success like you.

46:31.750 --> 46:33.750
This should offer him some relief.

46:41.416 --> 46:42.458
Shall we?

46:43.625 --> 46:44.791
Do you mind if I stay?

46:47.875 --> 46:49.833
He relapsed, but he's a friend.

46:50.708 --> 46:51.958
I still care about him.

46:51.958 --> 46:53.625
Of course, you do.

46:53.625 --> 46:56.291
Yes, you're welcome to stay.

47:54.083 --> 47:56.375
I'm bringing you to a Mandalorian covert.

47:56.375 --> 47:58.708
This is how we have survived in exile.

47:59.375 --> 48:00.541
I'm familiar.

48:00.541 --> 48:03.583
It's a secret location
and you are my guest.

48:03.583 --> 48:05.666
They still live by the old ways.

48:05.666 --> 48:09.708
Yes. It will go smoother
if you keep your helmet on. Trust me.

48:11.708 --> 48:12.875
Of course.

49:10.708 --> 49:12.041
Come no further.

49:12.958 --> 49:15.250
You are an apostate, Din Djarin.

49:15.250 --> 49:16.416
No longer.

49:17.250 --> 49:19.541
I have been to the mines of Mandalore.

49:19.541 --> 49:20.875
Impossible.

49:21.916 --> 49:24.250
The mines were collapsed in the Purge.

49:24.250 --> 49:25.666
The planet is cursed.

49:26.666 --> 49:29.083
These are lies meant to keep us in exile.

49:30.666 --> 49:32.833
How do we know
that it is not you who is lying?

49:32.833 --> 49:34.750
BO-KATAN: He speaks the truth.

49:35.666 --> 49:36.916
I was witness.

49:36.916 --> 49:39.166
And who are you, Nite Owl?

49:43.958 --> 49:46.666
I am Bo-Katan of Clan Kryze.

49:47.375 --> 49:51.666
Your House has fallen
from the Way. You are both apostates.

49:52.666 --> 49:54.750
We have been to the Living Waters.

50:02.375 --> 50:03.541
I bring proof.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.750
We shall see.

50:59.708 --> 51:02.833
Din Djarin claims
to have bathed in the Living Waters.

51:04.458 --> 51:05.458
Is this true?

51:06.458 --> 51:09.125
It is. I have proof.

51:19.416 --> 51:20.416
BO-KATAN: I was witness.

51:20.416 --> 51:23.041
He fell into the depths
and I pulled him out.

51:43.208 --> 51:44.875
He speaks the truth.

51:46.291 --> 51:48.375
These are indeed the Living Waters.

51:50.291 --> 51:53.250
Din Djarin, you are redeemed.

51:53.958 --> 51:56.375
This is the Way.

51:59.208 --> 52:06.083
And Bo-Katan Kryze,
by Creed, you too are redeemed.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.458
BO-KATAN: But I do not walk the Way.

52:12.208 --> 52:13.791
Did you bathe in the waters?

52:14.958 --> 52:16.083
BO-KATAN: I did.

52:16.083 --> 52:19.166
And have you removed your helmet since?

52:20.166 --> 52:22.166
BO-KATAN: No, I have not.

52:23.208 --> 52:27.916
Then you may join our covert
and live as your ancestors once did.

52:29.583 --> 52:31.708
You may leave anytime you wish.

52:32.791 --> 52:35.458
Until then, you are one of us.

52:37.416 --> 52:40.541
Welcome, Bo-Katan of Clan Kryze.

52:41.166 --> 52:43.875
This is the Way.
