WEBVTT

00:10.120 --> 00:16.668
I am, beyond a doubt,
the last of the old-timers.

00:16.710 --> 00:21.006
My name is Jack Crabb.

00:21.048 --> 00:25.843
And I am the sole white survivor

00:25.885 --> 00:29.096
of the Battle
of Little Big Horn...

00:29.138 --> 00:31.098
uh... uh...

00:31.140 --> 00:36.896
popularly known
as Custer's Last Stand.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.939
Well...

00:38.981 --> 00:42.818
Mr. Crabb, I'm more interested

00:42.818 --> 00:46.447
in the primitive lifestyle
of the Plains Indian

00:46.489 --> 00:49.741
than I am in the...

00:49.783 --> 00:54.871
tall tales about Custer.

00:54.913 --> 00:58.333
Tall tales?!

00:58.333 --> 01:00.627
Are you calling me a liar?

01:00.668 --> 01:01.711
- No, no...
- Huh?

01:01.753 --> 01:04.381
No, it's just that...

01:04.422 --> 01:08.176
I'm interested
in the way of life

01:08.218 --> 01:13.680
of the Indian rather than,
shall we say, adventure.

01:13.722 --> 01:18.685
You think the Battle of Little
Big Horn was... was a...

01:20.229 --> 01:21.647
...was an adventure?

01:22.856 --> 01:24.316
Oh, shit.

01:24.358 --> 01:29.238
Little Big Horn was not
representative of...

01:29.279 --> 01:32.700
encounters between Whites
and Indians, Mr. Crabb.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.954
You see the...
near genocide of the Indian...

01:36.995 --> 01:39.872
The... the... the near what?!

01:39.914 --> 01:40.998
Near genocide.

01:42.792 --> 01:47.296
It means: "extermination;

01:49.298 --> 01:52.385
the killing off
of an entire people."

01:52.427 --> 01:56.514
That's practically
what we did to the Indian.

01:56.556 --> 02:01.519
But of course, I wouldn't expect
an old Indian fighter like you

02:01.602 --> 02:07.816
to agree with me.

02:07.858 --> 02:09.067
Turn that thing on.

02:09.109 --> 02:10.818
I beg your pardon?

02:10.860 --> 02:12.821
I said, turn that thing on

02:12.863 --> 02:15.449
and shut up.

02:19.119 --> 02:22.873
Now you just set there,
and you'll learn something.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.172
I knowed General
George Armstrong Custer

02:31.213 --> 02:34.842
for what he was.

02:34.884 --> 02:41.932
And I also knowed the Indians...
for what they was.

02:46.437 --> 02:54.778
111 years ago,
when I was ten years old,

02:54.778 --> 03:02.619
my family...
in crossin' the Great Plains...

03:02.660 --> 03:09.709
was wiped out
by a band of wild Indians.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074

03:48.788 --> 03:54.502
Everybody was killed or drug off
by them murderin' varmints,

03:54.627 --> 03:57.714
except me
and my sister Caroline.

05:45.858 --> 05:48.820
Good-bye, Jack.

05:48.861 --> 05:52.740
I'll see you in heaven.

05:52.782 --> 05:54.784
Good-bye, Caroline.

06:25.522 --> 06:28.442
We didn't know
the difference then,

06:28.483 --> 06:30.819
but it was a band of Pawnee
what attacked us before.

06:30.861 --> 06:35.198
I ain't had no use for Pawnee
ever since.

06:35.239 --> 06:38.242
But this one wasn't a Pawnee.

06:38.284 --> 06:41.162
He was a Cheyenne brave.

06:41.203 --> 06:43.622
I later got to know him well.

06:43.664 --> 06:46.584
His name was
Shadow That Comes In Sight.

07:21.534 --> 07:24.454
At first sight
of an Indian camp,

07:24.537 --> 07:29.666
what you think is, "I see
their dump, where's the camp?"

07:46.225 --> 07:48.519
He brought us to their chief.

07:48.602 --> 07:53.898
His name was Old Lodge Skins,
who later become my granddaddy.

08:02.573 --> 08:05.493
What do they want, Caroline?

08:05.535 --> 08:09.080
It's as plain as day
what they want, Jack.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.206
What?

08:10.248 --> 08:13.084
Me.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.420
To show good manners,

08:16.461 --> 08:21.133
Old Lodge Skins smoked
with our oldest male survivor.

09:01.797 --> 09:06.134
They didn't know I was a woman.

09:06.176 --> 09:11.431
That explains why
they didn't rape me right off.

09:11.473 --> 09:14.726
I don't think they're gonna
bother you, Caroline.

09:16.061 --> 09:19.606
No such luck, Jack.

09:19.647 --> 09:24.194
They'll get me tonight,
for sure.

09:37.206 --> 09:40.834
Poor Caroline never did
have no luck with men.

10:05.566 --> 10:08.152
I reckoned she figured
we both couldn't get away,

10:08.194 --> 10:11.322
and she'd send help back
to rescue me.

10:12.782 --> 10:17.245
Next morning, I found myself
in that Indian camp all alone.

10:23.917 --> 10:28.005
But the Cheyenne, who call
themselves the "Human Beings,"

10:28.046 --> 10:31.216
had no idea to hurt me.

10:31.258 --> 10:32.676
I was an honored guest,

10:32.718 --> 10:36.346
and they gave me a real treat
for breakfast: Boiled dog.

10:36.388 --> 10:38.765
Dog ain't bad, neither.

10:38.807 --> 10:41.476
Now dog is greasy, I'll admit,
but you'd be surprised

10:41.518 --> 10:44.228
how downright delicate
the flavor is,

10:44.270 --> 10:46.689
especially when you're starving.

10:46.731 --> 10:51.027
You see, the Human Beings
adopted me as one of their own.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.863
Shadow That Comes In Sight
taught me the bow and arrow

10:53.904 --> 10:56.532
and how to stalk game.

10:56.574 --> 10:58.784
Burns Red In The Sun

10:58.826 --> 11:02.580
showed me how to protect
my pale skin from sunburn.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.833
It's a little known fact that
some Indians, like Burns Red,

11:05.875 --> 11:09.085
will sunburn their own selves.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.714
But my real teacher
was my adopted grandpa,

11:12.756 --> 11:14.799
Old Lodge Skins.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.762
He taught me to read a trail,
the Cheyenne language,

11:18.803 --> 11:21.264
and lots of other things.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.857
For a boy,
it was a kind of paradise.

11:30.899 --> 11:34.026
I wasn't just playing Indian,

11:34.068 --> 11:36.236
I was living Indian.

11:44.953 --> 11:47.956
Only one thing bothered me.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.792
I was small for my years.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.460
In fact, a durn near runt.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.253
The Pawnee stole
seven of our ponies.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.089
There's gonna be a war party.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.257
But you can't go.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.301
You're too little
and weak like a girl.

12:03.638 --> 12:06.265
Run away now or I'll kick you.

12:10.645 --> 12:13.022
The Indians had never heard
of fistfightin',

12:13.064 --> 12:15.525
and it plum amazed 'em.

12:15.650 --> 12:16.943
How did you do that?

12:20.279 --> 12:21.531
I'm sorry, Younger Bear.

12:21.656 --> 12:22.949
I didn't mean to hurt you.

12:22.990 --> 12:27.661
The Indian way...
you should never feel sorry

12:27.703 --> 12:30.080
about beating an enemy unless
having conquered his body,

12:30.122 --> 12:33.959
you want his spirit as well.

12:34.001 --> 12:37.921
I had made the first
real enemy of my life.

12:38.005 --> 12:44.553
There once was a Human Being,
and he was very small,

12:44.636 --> 12:45.971
but he won a name:

12:46.013 --> 12:47.806
Little Man.

12:47.848 --> 12:50.224
You've heard of him.

12:50.266 --> 12:51.517
No, Grandfather.

12:51.559 --> 12:58.190
He went on a war party
against the Pawnees.

12:58.232 --> 13:01.861
But the Pawnees were many.

13:01.902 --> 13:06.073
One by one, the Human
Beings were rubbed out.

13:06.115 --> 13:09.493
Little Man was very brave.

13:09.535 --> 13:11.662
The Pawnees called out to him,

13:11.704 --> 13:15.874
"If you will quit fighting,
we will let you go."

13:15.915 --> 13:22.505
But Little Man answered,
"It's a good day to die."

13:22.547 --> 13:24.549
Finally, they cut off his head.

13:24.591 --> 13:28.678
But he kept fighting
without his head.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.182
He rode among the Pawnees
like a whirlwind.

13:32.223 --> 13:35.685
And his head...
it was stuck on a spear...

13:35.727 --> 13:38.520
started to shout the war cry.

13:45.110 --> 13:54.286
The Pawnees could take no more,
and they ran away.

13:54.328 --> 13:55.663
When they looked back,

13:55.704 --> 14:01.502
they saw the body of Little Man
lie down among his friends.

14:01.543 --> 14:08.049
Little Man was small,
but his bravery was big.

14:32.114 --> 14:34.282
The Human Beings don't require

14:34.324 --> 14:37.077
a boy to be a warrior
if he ain't got

14:37.119 --> 14:38.787
the temperament for it,

14:38.829 --> 14:40.497
and Little Horse didn't.

14:40.539 --> 14:44.501
If he wanted to stay behind
with the women

14:44.543 --> 14:47.671
that was all right
with the Human Beings.

15:09.191 --> 15:11.152
We will leave the ponies here.

15:11.193 --> 15:12.820
You two will hold them.

15:12.862 --> 15:15.489
No! I don't want to stay here.

15:15.573 --> 15:17.449
I want to go to the Pawnee camp.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.096
You!

15:41.014 --> 15:43.098
You aren't even a Human Being!

15:44.600 --> 15:45.601
You're white.

15:45.726 --> 15:47.853
He didn't believe it himself.

15:47.895 --> 15:49.813
Younger Bear was just trying

15:49.855 --> 15:51.940
to hand me
the worst possible insult.

16:22.261 --> 16:23.554
Little white man.

16:24.555 --> 16:27.100
Fool poor Pawnee.

16:32.938 --> 16:33.897
Big fooling.

16:33.939 --> 16:35.482
You want to eat?

16:35.524 --> 16:39.444
Shit, Pawnees was always
sucking up to whites.

16:39.444 --> 16:41.905
Little white man not mad, huh?

16:47.577 --> 16:49.371
See? Pawnee friend.

16:51.623 --> 16:52.708
See?!

16:52.749 --> 16:54.960
Fixes bad Injun
for little white man.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.887
I always felt kind of bad
about that poor Pawnee.

17:07.930 --> 17:11.767
I didn't mean to kill him.

17:11.809 --> 17:13.978
I just meant to distract him.

17:17.147 --> 17:19.817
I had made a real enemy
of Younger Bear.

17:19.858 --> 17:21.568
I give you these ponies...

17:21.608 --> 17:25.113
but... I owe you a life.

17:25.155 --> 17:28.366
Saving his life
was the final insult.

17:28.407 --> 17:31.828
This boy is no longer a boy.

17:31.828 --> 17:33.121
He's a brave.

17:33.163 --> 17:38.251
He is little in body,
but his heart is big.

17:38.293 --> 17:42.422
His name shall be
"Little Big Man."

18:47.693 --> 18:49.361
I don't understand it,
Grandfather.

18:49.403 --> 18:52.114
Why would they kill
women and children?

18:52.155 --> 18:54.408
Because they are strange.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.873
They do not seem to know
where the center

19:02.915 --> 19:04.208
of the Earth is.

19:24.603 --> 19:26.896
We must have
a war on these cowards

19:26.938 --> 19:29.482
and teach them a lesson.

19:54.715 --> 19:58.010
This will be the first time,
my son,

19:58.052 --> 20:00.804
I face the whites as an enemy.

20:02.931 --> 20:06.268
I don't know
whether you remember

20:06.310 --> 20:09.021
before you became a Human Being,

20:09.063 --> 20:12.941
and as dear a son to me as those

20:12.983 --> 20:14.985
I made with Buffalo Wallow
Woman and the others...

20:18.071 --> 20:21.449
But I won't speak of
that unfortunate time.

20:21.491 --> 20:25.912
I just want to say,
if you believe

20:25.953 --> 20:29.874
riding against these
white creatures is bad,

20:29.916 --> 20:32.585
you can stay out of the fight.

20:32.627 --> 20:35.838
No one will think the worse.

20:39.842 --> 20:42.260
Grandfather,

20:42.302 --> 20:44.971
I think it's a good day to die.

20:47.683 --> 20:51.478
My heart soars like a hawk.

20:57.484 --> 21:00.904
I'm sorry to say
that Old Lodge Skins' war

21:00.946 --> 21:03.240
against the whites
was kind of pitiful.

21:04.533 --> 21:07.868
Not that the Human Being
wasn't brave.

21:07.910 --> 21:09.328
No warrior ever
walked the earth

21:09.370 --> 21:12.039
more brave than a Human Being.

21:19.338 --> 21:21.841
Old Lodge Skins' idea of war
and the whites' idea of war

21:21.882 --> 21:23.968
were kind of different.

21:24.010 --> 21:26.595
Half our party
didn't even use weapons.

21:26.721 --> 21:28.597
What they done was "take coup,"

21:28.639 --> 21:30.890
hit the enemy
with a little stick.

21:30.932 --> 21:32.934
Humiliate them.

21:32.976 --> 21:35.729
That was how the Human Beings
taught a coward a lesson

21:35.770 --> 21:37.147
and won a war.

21:37.188 --> 21:38.773
Shadow!

21:38.815 --> 21:40.775
Look at 'em go!

21:40.817 --> 21:43.611
We got 'em runnin', boys!

21:43.737 --> 21:45.488
Go get that black bastard!

21:50.994 --> 21:54.289
Shooting rifles
against bow and arrow.

21:54.331 --> 21:57.624
I never could understand
how the white world

21:57.750 --> 22:00.377
could be so proud of winning
with them kind of odds.

22:19.021 --> 22:21.856
God bless George Washington!

22:21.898 --> 22:25.652
Before I knowed it, them words
just popped out of my mouth.

22:25.693 --> 22:27.737
God bless my mother!

22:32.575 --> 22:33.951
You murdering fool!

22:36.454 --> 22:38.414
Got to cut your throat to get it
through your head

22:38.456 --> 22:39.457
I'm a white man.

22:39.457 --> 22:40.625
White?

22:41.459 --> 22:45.671
Sure I'm white.

22:45.754 --> 22:47.964
Didn't you hear me say
"God bless George Washington"?

22:48.006 --> 22:48.965
"God bless my mother"?

22:49.007 --> 22:50.759
I mean, now, what kind
of Indian would say

22:50.801 --> 22:51.802
a fool thing like that?

22:53.303 --> 22:55.347
Lend me that
to get off this paint.

22:58.183 --> 22:59.935
Yeah.

22:59.977 --> 23:02.104
The troopers took me
under their wing

23:02.145 --> 23:05.232
and turned me over
to the Reverend Silas Pendrake

23:05.273 --> 23:06.441
for moral guidance

23:06.483 --> 23:08.944
and a Christian upbringing.

23:08.985 --> 23:11.237
Can you drive a buggy, boy?

23:11.278 --> 23:12.279
Oh, yes, sir.

23:12.321 --> 23:13.322
I can do it.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.615
You're a liar, boy.

23:14.657 --> 23:16.784
If you was reared by the Indians

23:16.826 --> 23:19.286
how could you learn
to drive a buggy?

23:19.328 --> 23:22.289
We shall have to beat
the lying out of you.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.141
Oh, dear Jack.

23:42.892 --> 23:44.769
Welcome to your new home.

23:45.812 --> 23:51.401
Your travail is over,
enfolded now as you are

23:51.443 --> 23:53.361
in Christian love.

23:53.361 --> 23:56.990
Well, boy,
are you unable to converse?

23:57.032 --> 23:59.658
Huh?

23:59.700 --> 24:02.161
No, I'm glad to meet
your daughter, sir.

24:02.202 --> 24:04.788
You are addressing my wife, boy.

24:05.873 --> 24:06.999
Poor boy.

24:07.041 --> 24:09.626
Poor darling.

24:09.668 --> 24:12.004
Think of the years
of suffering,

24:12.046 --> 24:16.216
deprivation and hardship
among those awful savages.

24:17.217 --> 24:19.637
The boy's deprivation, my dear,

24:19.720 --> 24:22.473
has been more spiritual
than physical.

24:22.514 --> 24:25.183
The Indians know nothing of God

24:25.224 --> 24:27.018
and moral right.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.354
They eat human flesh,

24:29.395 --> 24:31.314
fornicate,

24:31.356 --> 24:32.732
adulterize,

24:32.774 --> 24:36.986
misogynize and
commune constantly

24:37.028 --> 24:38.655
with minions of the devil.

24:38.738 --> 24:43.534
It must be our task,
nay, our Christian duty,

24:43.576 --> 24:45.203
to beat the misery out...

24:45.244 --> 24:47.038
Beat the poor boy?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.539
Not while there's
a breath left in my body.

24:49.581 --> 24:50.999
I could have kissed her.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.877
Well, I didn't mean
beat him literally, my dear.

24:53.919 --> 24:57.255
I meant to beat him
symbolically.

24:57.297 --> 24:58.340
Poor boy.

24:58.382 --> 25:01.385
He hasn't even had
a proper bath.

25:01.426 --> 25:04.346
His darling neck is so...
I detect the odor of food.

25:04.388 --> 25:06.139
I shall wash this poor,
dirty boy.

25:06.181 --> 25:07.140
It's suppertime!

25:07.182 --> 25:08.934
Silas,

25:08.976 --> 25:11.979
it is my Christian duty
to give this boy an immediate

25:12.020 --> 25:13.063
thorough bath.

25:13.105 --> 25:15.231
Take off your clothes, dear.

25:15.272 --> 25:16.565
Take my clothes off?

25:16.607 --> 25:17.608
Yes.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.734
All of them?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.487
E-Every stitch.

25:21.529 --> 25:26.617
But I shall avert my eyes
at the necessary moment.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.915
Bringing in

25:32.957 --> 25:35.209
The sheaves

25:35.251 --> 25:38.837
Bringing in the sheaves

25:38.878 --> 25:42.632
We shall come rejoicing

25:42.674 --> 25:46.303
Bringing in the sheaves.

25:46.344 --> 25:50.223
Greatest bath
I ever had in my life.

25:50.265 --> 25:56.771
Shall we gather at the river,

25:56.813 --> 26:04.153
The beautiful,
the beautiful river?

26:11.577 --> 26:14.872
You do realize,
don't you, dear Jack,

26:14.913 --> 26:19.626
that the Reverend Pendrake
is not altogether wrong.

26:19.668 --> 26:20.711
What?

26:20.753 --> 26:22.463
What, ma'am?

26:22.504 --> 26:26.925
Well, Jesus is your savior.

26:26.967 --> 26:30.470
You do realize that,
don't you dear Jack?

26:30.511 --> 26:33.056
Oh, Lordy, yes, Mrs. Pendrake.

26:33.097 --> 26:35.808
Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?

26:35.850 --> 26:37.185
Yes'm. Yes, ma'am.

26:37.226 --> 26:38.227
Yes, ma'am.

26:38.269 --> 26:40.813
But you musn't fib to me,
you know.

26:40.855 --> 26:43.816
Oh, no, I love Jesus and Moses
and all of them...

26:45.068 --> 26:49.113
There's quite a difference.

26:49.155 --> 26:55.827
Moses was a Hebrew,
but Jesus was a gentile,

26:55.869 --> 26:57.954
like you and me.

26:57.996 --> 27:00.499
Aren't you done
washing that boy yet?

27:00.540 --> 27:04.544
I'm giving the child important
religious instruction, Silas.

27:04.586 --> 27:05.837
I want to eat!

27:07.756 --> 27:11.134
Looks like a pretty well-growed
child, if you ask me.

27:11.176 --> 27:14.346
All right now, dear,

27:14.388 --> 27:20.893
please stand up
and let me dry you off.

27:20.935 --> 27:25.856
I shall avert my eyes,
of course.

27:25.898 --> 27:30.194
Fine... now step
out of the tub...

27:30.236 --> 27:32.238
and...

27:36.617 --> 27:42.747
Actually, you are
rather well grown, Jack.

27:42.789 --> 27:47.002
You're small but...
nice-Iooking.

27:47.043 --> 27:49.546
Did you know that?

27:49.587 --> 27:52.048
No, ma'am.

27:52.090 --> 27:53.216
Well, you are.

27:53.258 --> 27:56.636
All the more reason
for you to receive

27:56.720 --> 27:59.514
complete religious
instruction.

27:59.556 --> 28:03.393
The girls, I'm sure,
will all be after you.

28:03.435 --> 28:04.561
And Jack...

28:04.686 --> 28:06.271
Ma'am?

28:06.313 --> 28:10.107
That way lies madness.

28:10.149 --> 28:11.692
What way, ma'am?

28:15.112 --> 28:20.868
You, you'll understand these
things better when you're older.

28:20.909 --> 28:23.495
The point is, my dear boy

28:23.537 --> 28:28.751
that we all
must resist temptation.

28:29.918 --> 28:34.672
Purity is its own reward.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.885
Dear Jack.

28:59.363 --> 29:01.740
Welcome to your new home.

29:04.242 --> 29:06.828
Now dress...

29:06.870 --> 29:10.374
and come in to supper.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.586
I went to school
and learned all over

29:14.670 --> 29:17.214
how to read and write
and cipher.

29:17.255 --> 29:20.300
It was strange at first,
but Mrs. Pendrake tutored me,

29:20.342 --> 29:23.302
and I learned fast.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.471
But there was one thing I didn't
know nothing about,

29:25.513 --> 29:28.557
and that was a thing called sin.

29:28.599 --> 29:31.185
Aha! I caught you
at the gates of hell!

29:31.227 --> 29:32.186
Boy!

29:32.228 --> 29:33.312
The hand of God

29:33.354 --> 29:36.899
must smite the carcass of man!

29:39.902 --> 29:42.321
It's worth it, dear, Jack.

29:42.363 --> 29:47.367
It's worth it a million times
over to be pure and good.

29:47.409 --> 29:50.870
To walk in the paths
of righteousness.

29:50.912 --> 29:53.623
There's no happiness like it.

29:53.707 --> 29:55.959
Do you believe me, Jack?

29:56.001 --> 29:57.627
Do you believe me?

29:57.711 --> 29:59.004
Yes, ma'am.

29:59.045 --> 30:00.338
I sure do.

30:00.463 --> 30:03.383
Amazing grace, how sweet...

30:03.383 --> 30:06.845
So it was I entered
my religion period.

30:06.886 --> 30:09.723
I was a great
little hymn singer.

30:09.806 --> 30:12.391
And I wasn't fooling, neither.

30:12.433 --> 30:13.809
I'd been saved!

30:13.851 --> 30:16.895
I baptize you in the name
of the Father and the Son

30:16.937 --> 30:18.188
and the Holy Spirit!

30:18.230 --> 30:19.732
Oh, Lord, look down upon

30:19.815 --> 30:21.692
this poor boy who lived
among the heathen,

30:21.734 --> 30:24.194
and cleanse him
of the corruption

30:24.236 --> 30:27.197
of their foul and pagan ways.

30:27.239 --> 30:29.658
And make him white
again as the snow.

30:29.700 --> 30:32.077
Let him be reborn
and repurified

30:32.077 --> 30:33.162
in Thy name.

30:33.203 --> 30:34.371
I baptize you

30:34.413 --> 30:35.539
in the name of the Father

30:35.581 --> 30:37.999
and the Son
and the Holy Spirit!

30:38.041 --> 30:39.042
Amen.

30:40.627 --> 30:43.296
Mrs. Pendrake was right
about temptation.

30:43.338 --> 30:45.006
Jack...

30:45.048 --> 30:46.341
I wasn't having nothing

30:46.382 --> 30:48.426
to do with them Jezebels.

30:48.468 --> 30:51.888
I told her all about my triumph
over temptation,

30:51.929 --> 30:55.767
and we read the Bible
for about an hour, to celebrate.

30:57.393 --> 31:02.064
As the weeks went by,
I fell more and more

31:02.105 --> 31:04.066
in love with Mrs. Pendrake.

31:04.107 --> 31:06.693
Spiritually, of course.

31:06.735 --> 31:08.403
Well...

31:08.445 --> 31:10.656
I shall be off on
my Wednesday shopping.

31:10.697 --> 31:12.157
The boy's doing so poor
these days,

31:12.199 --> 31:13.992
why don't you
take him along and air him?

31:16.078 --> 31:18.580
He'd be bored with shopping.

31:18.622 --> 31:19.581
No, I wouldn't, ma'am.

31:21.917 --> 31:24.169
All right, then,
you come with me, Jack.

31:31.634 --> 31:33.469
Good morning, Mr. Kane.

31:33.469 --> 31:35.346
Ma'am.

31:35.388 --> 31:37.640
This is Jack,

31:37.682 --> 31:39.558
my adopted son.

31:41.519 --> 31:45.147
What's your pleasure, ma'am?

31:45.189 --> 31:47.984
Well, let's see...

31:48.025 --> 31:54.572
I think I shall have
a sassafras flip.

31:58.326 --> 32:00.370
How about you, buster?

32:00.412 --> 32:02.247
Huh?

32:02.289 --> 32:04.416
Oh, yeah, I'll have the same.

32:16.427 --> 32:18.178
Never mind for me, Mr. Kane.

32:18.178 --> 32:19.888
I must be off
with my shopping.

32:19.930 --> 32:22.016
It would bore you terribly,
Jack, dear.

32:22.057 --> 32:23.851
You stay here
and have some cake.

32:23.892 --> 32:25.978
I'll take care of him,
Mrs. Pendrake.

32:26.020 --> 32:30.649
Thank you very much,
I'm sure, Mr. Kane.

32:51.961 --> 32:55.131
That soda shop was something.

32:55.173 --> 32:58.468
Especially that
elephant-head spigot.

32:58.509 --> 33:02.305
I was playing with it,
and enjoying myself,

33:02.347 --> 33:05.599
then, all of a sudden,
an awful feeling

33:05.641 --> 33:07.893
run through me.

33:07.893 --> 33:09.394
Where had that fellow gone to?

33:17.402 --> 33:19.071
Don't...

33:19.112 --> 33:21.198
Don't...

33:21.239 --> 33:23.075
No, don't...

33:23.116 --> 33:24.576
Oh, yeah...

33:24.576 --> 33:26.161
No, don't!

33:26.203 --> 33:28.372
You beast...

33:28.413 --> 33:30.539
Do-Don't...

33:30.581 --> 33:32.708
Pagan beast! Oh!

33:32.750 --> 33:33.876
Help!

33:35.711 --> 33:38.297
Oh, oh, you devil!

33:40.216 --> 33:42.385
You filthy, dirty devil!

33:44.470 --> 33:45.429
Heathen!

33:45.471 --> 33:46.514
Yes! No!

33:46.555 --> 33:47.723
Ye... Ye... Ye...

33:47.807 --> 33:49.058
Oh! Yeah, yeah...

33:49.100 --> 33:51.060
Yeah, yeah...

33:51.102 --> 33:52.019
No... Help!

33:52.061 --> 33:53.270
Help! Help! I'm dying...

33:53.312 --> 33:56.481
She was calling him a devil
and moaning for help,

33:56.523 --> 34:00.068
but I didn't get no idea
she wanted to be rescued.

34:06.992 --> 34:11.121
That was the end
of my religion period.

34:11.161 --> 34:15.917
I ain't sung a hymn
in 104 years.

34:15.958 --> 34:19.670
After starving awhile,
I took up with a swindler.

34:19.754 --> 34:22.172
Name of
Allardyce T. Meriweather.

34:22.214 --> 34:23.674
After Mrs. Pendrake,

34:23.716 --> 34:26.427
his honesty was
downright refreshing.

34:26.467 --> 34:28.304
At no cost to you,
it is my mission

34:28.344 --> 34:30.306
to pass on to you
Dead Man's Potion...

34:32.056 --> 34:35.893
Meriweather was one of the
smartest men I ever knowed.

34:35.936 --> 34:36.937
But he tended

34:36.978 --> 34:40.107
to lose parts of himself.

34:40.149 --> 34:43.193
When I joined him,
his left hand and his left ear

34:43.235 --> 34:45.069
were already gone.

34:45.110 --> 34:46.696
...might be able
to see a miracle,

34:46.821 --> 34:49.449
one I have witnessed
many times before.

34:49.489 --> 34:51.868
The power of this
elixir has been proven

34:51.909 --> 34:53.786
to reverse men's ills...

34:55.580 --> 34:57.498
It'll cure your sores and...

34:57.498 --> 34:59.876
During my years with
Meriweather,

34:59.917 --> 35:01.711
he lost an eye as a result

35:01.753 --> 35:04.422
of a fifth ace
dropping out of his sleeve

35:04.464 --> 35:05.840
in a poker game.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.134
It didn't faze him, though.

35:08.176 --> 35:10.802
Deception was his life's blood,

35:10.844 --> 35:12.763
even if it caused him

35:12.804 --> 35:16.642
to get whittled down
kind of gradual-like.

35:16.683 --> 35:18.185
Thank you.

35:18.226 --> 35:19.478
You're improving, Jack.

35:19.519 --> 35:21.271
You just can't seem to get rid

35:21.313 --> 35:23.190
of that streak of honesty
in you.

35:23.231 --> 35:27.194
The one that ruined you was
that damned Indian, old Tepee.

35:27.235 --> 35:29.071
You mean Old Lodge Skins.

35:29.112 --> 35:33.033
He gave you a vision
of moral order in the universe,

35:33.075 --> 35:34.617
and there isn't any.

35:36.118 --> 35:38.829
Those stars twinkle
in a void, there, boy,

35:38.871 --> 35:42.833
and the two-legged creature
schemes and dreams beneath them,

35:42.875 --> 35:47.171
all in vain.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.298
All in vain, Jack.

35:49.340 --> 35:50.633
You hear anything?

35:50.675 --> 35:51.759
Listen to me!

35:52.760 --> 35:55.262
Two-legged creature
will believe anything,

35:55.304 --> 35:57.598
and the more preposterous,
the better.

35:57.640 --> 36:01.851
Whales speak French
at the bottom of the sea.

36:01.893 --> 36:05.438
The horses of Arabia
have silver wings.

36:05.480 --> 36:09.484
Pygmies mate with elephants
in darkest Africa.

36:09.526 --> 36:10.485
I have sold

36:10.527 --> 36:13.238
all those propositions.

36:22.372 --> 36:26.250
Or maybe we're all fools,
and none of it matters.

36:26.292 --> 36:29.336
Ah.

36:40.264 --> 36:43.851
You stay
with Allardyce Meriweather,

36:43.892 --> 36:46.103
and you'll wear silk.

36:48.272 --> 36:50.815
But I don't know as
I want to wear silk.

36:52.066 --> 36:54.777
My dear boy, what else

36:54.819 --> 36:56.904
can a man of parts wear
than silk?

36:56.946 --> 36:58.615
Tar and feathers,

36:58.656 --> 37:00.533
I reckon!

37:00.575 --> 37:01.868
All right.

37:01.909 --> 37:03.161
Sit right there.

37:03.202 --> 37:04.996
Don't make no moves

37:05.038 --> 37:07.749
unless you want a little
daylight in your liver.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.376
What, may I ask, brings you out

37:10.418 --> 37:13.171
into the wilds
at this hour, sir?

37:13.212 --> 37:15.047
- Is them the ones?
- That's them.

37:15.088 --> 37:17.924
I see'd this young 'un
somewhere before.

37:17.966 --> 37:19.968
I never been in this country.

37:20.010 --> 37:22.095
You look mighty familiar, bub.

37:25.474 --> 37:26.975
Oh! Sir!

37:29.227 --> 37:30.270
What's you got in there?

37:30.312 --> 37:31.438
Lye?

37:31.480 --> 37:33.231
Well, sir, now you can hardly
expect me

37:33.357 --> 37:35.025
to reveal its constituents.

37:35.067 --> 37:36.401
Sir, please, you're... you know

37:36.443 --> 37:38.320
you're-you're wasting
precious medicine.

37:38.362 --> 37:39.737
Seven folks are half dead

37:39.779 --> 37:41.364
because of this
precious medicine.

37:41.405 --> 37:42.531
What's in it?

37:42.573 --> 37:45.201
Why, nothing harmful,
I assure you.

37:45.242 --> 37:46.077
What?!

37:46.118 --> 37:48.120
Mostly water.

37:49.789 --> 37:52.750
Whiskey, a little pepper,

37:52.833 --> 37:54.835
oil of cloves, um, um...

37:56.587 --> 37:57.755
...ginger root...

37:57.880 --> 37:58.839
Whew!

38:02.134 --> 38:04.260
Ugh, what's that?

38:04.302 --> 38:06.721
What's what?

38:08.348 --> 38:10.475
Oh, that.

38:10.517 --> 38:13.186
It's a dozen snake heads

38:13.228 --> 38:15.188
to give it strength.

38:15.230 --> 38:17.732
All right, boys!

38:19.109 --> 38:21.611
Let's burn them feathers.

38:21.653 --> 38:23.947
Yee-ha!

38:27.617 --> 38:30.995
Got caught, Jack, that's all.

38:31.036 --> 38:34.415
Life contains a particle
of risk.

38:34.456 --> 38:37.251
Mr. Meriweather, you don't know
when you're licked.

38:37.293 --> 38:38.419
Licked?

38:38.460 --> 38:40.045
I'm not licked.

38:40.087 --> 38:43.215
I'm tarred and feathered,
that's all.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.218
All right, boys.

38:46.260 --> 38:48.012
I reckon
they've been run enough.

38:54.142 --> 38:58.563
I know I see'd you somewhere.

38:58.605 --> 38:59.606
What's your name, son?

39:01.774 --> 39:03.651
Jack Crabb.

39:03.693 --> 39:06.029
Lord above!

39:06.070 --> 39:07.280
I've tarred

39:07.322 --> 39:09.907
and feathered my own brother!

39:13.536 --> 39:15.913
It's wonderful, Jack.

39:15.955 --> 39:18.040
I can give you something

39:18.081 --> 39:19.708
you never had before.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.084
And something

39:21.126 --> 39:22.878
I never had before neither.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.714
A real...

39:25.839 --> 39:27.341
family life.

39:27.382 --> 39:28.508
Yeah.

39:33.180 --> 39:36.767
You are back in the bosom
of your family, Jack.

39:40.646 --> 39:41.730
Okay,

39:41.772 --> 39:43.397
now you.

39:43.439 --> 39:44.649
Caroline, I mean, I don't...

39:44.690 --> 39:45.733
I don't know anything
about guns.

39:45.858 --> 39:47.026
I mean,
I never even carried none.

39:47.068 --> 39:48.694
Oh,

39:48.736 --> 39:51.906
Lord, what kind of upbringing
did them Injuns give you?

39:51.948 --> 39:54.075
Never carried no gun?

39:54.116 --> 39:58.162
Why, a man ain't complete
without a gun.

39:58.204 --> 39:59.538
Go snake-eyed.

39:59.538 --> 40:00.748
Do what?

40:00.873 --> 40:04.251
Like this...

40:04.293 --> 40:07.546
Like this!

40:12.342 --> 40:14.552
All right.

40:14.594 --> 40:17.389
Now, draw and shoot

40:17.389 --> 40:18.473
that bottle,

40:18.515 --> 40:20.517
before you touch the gun.

40:20.558 --> 40:23.353
But Caroline, how can
I draw and shoot the gun

40:23.395 --> 40:25.355
before I touch it?

40:25.397 --> 40:27.232
Concentrate. Try it.

40:37.116 --> 40:39.660
Oh!

40:39.702 --> 40:42.413
Hot damn!

40:42.454 --> 40:43.789
Yeah.

40:43.831 --> 40:45.582
Caroline was right.

40:45.624 --> 40:49.712
It is possible to shoot a gun
before you touch it.

40:49.753 --> 40:54.091
Of course,
it takes lightning reflexes,

40:54.091 --> 40:58.344
and considerable
snake-eyed concentration.

41:08.062 --> 41:09.814
Throw up three.

41:13.359 --> 41:15.486
Why, Hickok hisself
can't hit three.

41:15.528 --> 41:17.989
Throw up three.

41:37.132 --> 41:40.260
Natural born gunfighter.

41:42.596 --> 41:46.974
So it was
I entered my gunfighter period.

42:19.673 --> 42:21.299
You're crowding me.

42:22.801 --> 42:25.762
Oh, Kid... I didn't
s-see you; I'm sorry.

42:25.845 --> 42:28.306
It's stupid of me
to take up all the room.

42:28.348 --> 42:29.683
I was just talking here.

42:29.683 --> 42:30.892
Set me up with a sody-pop.

42:30.934 --> 42:32.060
Yes, sir.

42:32.102 --> 42:33.853
Right away, Kid.

42:33.895 --> 42:37.982
The Soda Pop Kid,
that's what they called me.

42:41.694 --> 42:42.736
Sody-pop, he wants.

43:00.963 --> 43:03.673
Anything wrong with that,
stranger?

43:03.715 --> 43:05.592
Oh, not a thing, friend.

43:05.633 --> 43:07.010
In fact, I admire

43:07.051 --> 43:08.428
the style of it.

43:08.469 --> 43:11.139
Might I ask
who I are addressing?

43:11.180 --> 43:12.849
I'm Wild Bill Hickok.

43:17.312 --> 43:19.355
Well, I'm...

43:22.191 --> 43:24.611
I'm pleased to meet you,
I'm sure.

43:24.652 --> 43:26.862
The pleasure's mutual, friend.

43:26.903 --> 43:29.531
Bring your soda pop over here
and sit for a while.

44:17.619 --> 44:20.914
I can break three bottles
throwed in the air.

44:24.793 --> 44:26.252
That's shootin'.

44:33.051 --> 44:36.972
How many men have you...

44:37.013 --> 44:39.015
gunned down?

44:43.269 --> 44:44.770
I don't rightly recollect.

44:44.853 --> 44:46.355
How many have you?

44:46.397 --> 44:50.359
Oh, about...

44:50.401 --> 44:52.403
two dozen.

44:55.656 --> 44:57.074
Is that a fact?

44:57.116 --> 44:59.410
No, it wasn't a fact at all.

44:59.451 --> 45:04.331
During my gunfighter period,
I was an awful liar.

45:04.331 --> 45:07.959
I wouldn't have estimated
your total that high.

45:08.001 --> 45:09.919
No offense intended, old Hoss,

45:09.961 --> 45:13.464
but you don't have the look
of murder in your eye.

45:13.506 --> 45:15.967
Like, for example,
that buzzard over there.

45:16.009 --> 45:17.010
Him?

45:17.051 --> 45:20.680
Well, he's just a common drunk.

45:44.202 --> 45:46.246
What you so nervous about?

45:48.790 --> 45:50.542
Gettin' shot.

45:53.378 --> 45:54.671
I got a full house!

45:54.713 --> 45:56.005
I got a...

45:56.047 --> 45:57.256
I got a full house.

45:59.008 --> 46:00.551
Now you got me doing it.

46:02.803 --> 46:04.972
Sorry.

46:05.014 --> 46:07.058
Hold the fort a while,
old horse,

46:07.099 --> 46:08.643
while I get another bottle.

46:31.331 --> 46:35.252
Did you know the man, Bill?

46:35.293 --> 46:37.212
Never saw the gent before.

46:40.173 --> 46:43.635
Mr. Hickok,
that man is really dead.

46:43.677 --> 46:45.928
Got him through the lungs
and heart both.

46:54.728 --> 46:56.772
Selling your gunfighter outfit.

46:56.814 --> 46:58.440
Turning in

46:58.482 --> 47:00.693
your gun.

47:00.734 --> 47:01.819
Well, I'm sorry, Caroline...

47:01.902 --> 47:06.282
There ain't nothin'
in this world more useless

47:06.323 --> 47:10.285
than a gunfighter
who can't shoot people.

47:15.331 --> 47:17.125
Men!

47:17.166 --> 47:17.875
Hyah-ha!

47:20.962 --> 47:25.383
There went the bosom
of my family.

47:25.466 --> 47:30.555
Having tried religion,
the snake oil business,

47:30.597 --> 47:33.558
and gunfightin', without
no great amount of success,

47:33.600 --> 47:35.475
I took me a partner,

47:35.517 --> 47:37.019
become a respectable
storekeeper,

47:37.060 --> 47:39.187
and married Olga,

47:39.229 --> 47:42.357
a Swedish girl who couldn't
hardly speak no English.

47:42.399 --> 47:44.901
Preserve the moment.

47:44.943 --> 47:46.278
Yes.

47:51.617 --> 47:55.954
Olga, shall I carry you
over the threshold?

47:55.996 --> 47:57.247
Ja.

48:00.416 --> 48:02.793
It-it... it's a custom.

48:02.835 --> 48:04.295
Ja.

48:19.435 --> 48:20.937
Well, it ain't much now, Olga,

48:20.978 --> 48:25.482
but me and my partner,
we got... we got big plans.

48:25.523 --> 48:30.153
Free enterprise
and honest sweat.

48:33.657 --> 48:36.660
Ja. Ja.

48:47.045 --> 48:49.130
I don't understand
this bill of lading.

48:49.172 --> 48:50.923
It looks like
I'm being charged twice

48:50.965 --> 48:52.383
for the same goods.

48:52.424 --> 48:55.219
Ja, the bills of the store.

48:55.261 --> 48:57.263
It must be
a bookkeeping error.

48:57.304 --> 48:59.223
Honest Jack Applebaum
wouldn't do that to me.

48:59.265 --> 49:01.809
Ja, enough the bills.

49:01.892 --> 49:03.143
Come and get some rest.

49:03.185 --> 49:07.523
I must be making the mistake.

49:07.564 --> 49:09.066
Ja!

49:09.108 --> 49:11.986
The rest. The body.
You needs it.

49:12.027 --> 49:14.946
Yeah.

49:14.988 --> 49:17.031
Maybe I do.

49:38.886 --> 49:40.387
Rest!

50:22.178 --> 50:25.264
Olga... Olga, come on.

50:25.306 --> 50:27.183
We'll get out of this
somehow.

50:27.224 --> 50:29.976
One little thing about
my new business partner...

50:30.018 --> 50:31.436
he was a thief.

50:33.313 --> 50:35.607
...25 cents for this
musical instrument.

50:35.649 --> 50:37.108
This glorious
musical instrument

50:37.150 --> 50:39.819
this glorious musical instrument
that I present to you now.

50:39.861 --> 50:40.820
I want you to take a look

50:40.862 --> 50:42.322
at this beautiful
musical instrument.

50:42.364 --> 50:44.866
Who will take this beautiful
instrument? Who will take it?

50:46.952 --> 50:48.286
That is a pathetic scene.

50:48.328 --> 50:49.746
Yes, sir.

50:49.788 --> 50:51.331
A ruined and desolate family

50:51.373 --> 50:54.166
wiped out
by economic misfortune.

50:54.208 --> 50:55.960
- I find it touching.
- Yes, sir.

50:56.001 --> 51:00.089
I'll never forget
the first time I set eyes

51:00.130 --> 51:05.469
on General
George Armstrong Custer.

51:05.511 --> 51:07.680
Ruined! That what we is, Jack!

51:07.721 --> 51:09.473
Ruined!

51:11.350 --> 51:13.227
Do you have another trade,
my good man?

51:13.269 --> 51:16.981
Well, General, I...
not exactly.

51:17.022 --> 51:20.400
Then take my advice: Go west.

51:20.441 --> 51:23.945
West! Oh! Oh!

51:24.028 --> 51:26.239
My wife, she... she's
awful scared of Indians.

51:26.281 --> 51:28.199
My dear woman,
you have nothing to fear

51:28.241 --> 51:30.159
from the Indians;
I give you

51:30.201 --> 51:31.327
my personal guarantee.

51:36.332 --> 51:39.127
Olga! Olga!

51:40.920 --> 51:42.547
Hit him! Hit him!

51:42.589 --> 51:43.797
Sorry, brother.

51:56.518 --> 51:57.978
I think we're going to get away!

52:07.487 --> 52:09.196
Let me at the savages!

52:09.238 --> 52:10.531
I got a gun!
Let me at 'em!

52:10.573 --> 52:11.741
Let me at 'em!
Let me at 'em!

52:11.782 --> 52:12.783
I got a gun here!

52:12.867 --> 52:14.911
We must be civilized!

52:14.952 --> 52:17.204
Hey! Hey!

52:17.246 --> 52:19.081
"And it came to pass,
after the plague,

52:19.123 --> 52:21.626
"that the Lord stayed,
and then He said..."

52:30.259 --> 52:32.720
Grab the reins!
Grab the reins!

52:32.762 --> 52:33.511
Shoot him!

52:35.597 --> 52:37.766
Give me... give me
that shotgun!

52:37.807 --> 52:40.352
No, it's mine!

54:12.274 --> 54:14.108
Get back in! Get back!

54:17.194 --> 54:19.530
I'll protect you!

54:33.294 --> 54:34.086
Olga!

54:36.297 --> 54:37.797
Olga!

54:39.049 --> 54:40.008
Ow!

54:40.050 --> 54:43.011
Olga...

54:48.224 --> 54:52.312
I covered most of three states
and hundreds of square miles

54:52.354 --> 54:56.233
looking for Olga,
with no luck at all.

54:56.858 --> 54:58.235
Hey, Crabb!

54:58.235 --> 54:59.361
Whiskey...

54:59.402 --> 55:00.528
Crabb!

55:00.570 --> 55:01.529
Whiskey...
Whiskey...

55:01.571 --> 55:02.780
For a drink of whiskey,

55:02.821 --> 55:04.823
they'll give you
one of their squaws.

55:04.865 --> 55:05.824
Whiskey...

55:05.866 --> 55:06.992
Sure save you
a lot of looking.

55:17.086 --> 55:18.087
Whiskey...

55:18.170 --> 55:20.839
I looked everywhere for my wife

55:20.923 --> 55:22.841
but couldn't find her.

55:22.883 --> 55:27.345
Finally, I had to go
deeper into Cheyenne country.

55:27.387 --> 55:31.933
I didn't figure
for me it was dangerous...

55:31.975 --> 55:34.852
speaking Cheyenne and having
once been a Human Being myself.

55:42.110 --> 55:43.111
Let's kill him.

55:43.152 --> 55:44.696
I didn't steal
your father's ponies, brother.

55:44.737 --> 55:46.239
Why do you keep calling me
brother?

55:46.281 --> 55:48.408
I want you to stop doing that.

55:48.449 --> 55:49.784
I am not your brother.

55:49.826 --> 55:51.035
I am a Human Being.

55:51.077 --> 55:53.412
I suppose you will say
you have never heard

55:53.453 --> 55:54.413
of Little Big Man.

55:58.375 --> 56:00.877
Little Big Man was my brother,

56:00.919 --> 56:02.629
but you're not him.

56:02.671 --> 56:05.257
He fought beside me
in battle and was killed

56:05.299 --> 56:07.301
after rubbing out
many bluecoats.

56:07.342 --> 56:08.594
Did you see the body?

56:10.345 --> 56:13.473
No, he turned into a swallow
and flew away.

56:13.515 --> 56:14.600
Let's kill him and go home.

56:14.641 --> 56:15.392
Shadow!

56:15.434 --> 56:16.143
You were shot there.

56:16.184 --> 56:17.810
I picked you up

56:17.852 --> 56:18.936
and put you on a pony.

56:18.978 --> 56:20.229
I saved you.

56:20.271 --> 56:21.981
Dirt on the Nose.

56:22.815 --> 56:24.108
Do you still have the black pony

56:24.150 --> 56:25.484
I gave you
up at the Powder River?

56:25.526 --> 56:27.486
No, the Pawnee stole him,

56:27.528 --> 56:31.616
when we camp at the Old
Women Butte, five snows ago.

56:40.666 --> 56:44.628
It is true there is a thing here
I do not understand.

56:49.507 --> 56:52.427
There is a pain between my ears.

57:21.497 --> 57:24.583
My son.

57:24.625 --> 57:28.837
To see you again causes my heart
to soar like a hawk.

57:28.879 --> 57:30.339
Sit here

57:30.381 --> 57:32.048
beside me.

57:48.856 --> 57:51.025
Grandfather, I brought you

57:51.067 --> 57:53.027
this present.

57:53.069 --> 57:55.572
Is this the hat I used to own,

57:55.613 --> 57:58.490
except grown softer of skin

57:58.532 --> 57:59.866
and fatter?

57:59.908 --> 58:02.536
No, Grandfather, it's another.

58:09.376 --> 58:12.337
We must smoke to your return.

58:20.721 --> 58:23.389
I saw you in a dream.

58:23.431 --> 58:26.100
You were drinking from a spring

58:26.142 --> 58:29.812
that came from the long nose
of an animal.

58:29.896 --> 58:32.773
I did not recognize the animal.

58:32.773 --> 58:37.570
Alongside his nose,
he grew two horns,

58:37.612 --> 58:44.911
and the water that gushed
from his nose was full of air.

58:49.080 --> 58:51.082
I can't explain it,

58:51.124 --> 58:54.961
but he was talking about
that elephant-head spigot

58:54.961 --> 58:57.380
in the soda shop.

58:57.422 --> 59:00.759
And this wasn't the only time
Old Lodge Skins had dreams

59:00.800 --> 59:03.887
that turned out true.

59:03.929 --> 59:05.388
Don't be angry,

59:05.430 --> 59:06.598
my son,

59:06.640 --> 59:09.935
with Burns Red, Shadow,
and the others.

59:09.976 --> 59:14.688
They had many a bad experience
with the white man last year.

59:14.730 --> 59:19.193
I have thought and talked
and smoked on this matter

59:19.235 --> 59:22.905
and my decision is...

59:22.947 --> 59:26.283
Little Big Man has returned.

59:30.246 --> 59:33.791
It was quite a homecoming.

59:35.333 --> 59:36.542
Little Big Man.

59:37.335 --> 59:39.337
It was Little Horse,

59:39.337 --> 59:44.801
the boy who didn't want
to fight the Pawnee.

59:49.347 --> 59:50.932
Don't you remember me?

59:52.684 --> 59:55.812
This hurts me in my heart.

59:55.853 --> 59:59.482
I think I'll cry.

59:59.524 --> 01:00:01.316
He'd become a Heemanah,

01:00:01.358 --> 01:00:04.486
for which there ain't
no English word.

01:00:04.528 --> 01:00:06.363
And he was a good one, too.

01:00:06.405 --> 01:00:09.199
The Human Beings
thought a lot of him.

01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:36.058
Hello, Younger Bear.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.560
Good-bye.

01:00:37.602 --> 01:00:40.354
It was the boy
whose life I had saved,

01:00:40.396 --> 01:00:42.356
to his mortal embarrassment.

01:00:42.398 --> 01:00:46.861
Did you catch rabbits
on your hunting trip?

01:00:46.903 --> 01:00:48.070
No.

01:00:48.112 --> 01:00:49.196
Then don't give the rabbits

01:00:49.238 --> 01:00:50.530
you didn't catch

01:00:50.572 --> 01:00:51.990
to Buffalo Wallow Woman.

01:00:52.032 --> 01:00:53.575
You see,
Younger Bear had become

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:58.955
a Contrary, the most dangerous
of all Cheyenne warriors

01:00:59.039 --> 01:01:02.292
because the way they live
drives them half crazy.

01:01:02.334 --> 01:01:03.877
Except for battle,

01:01:04.002 --> 01:01:06.588
a Contrary
does everything backwards.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.507
He says good-bye
when he means hello,

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:12.844
yes when he means no,
walks through bushes

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:15.638
instead of on trails,
and washes with dirt,

01:01:15.679 --> 01:01:17.890
and dries with water
and so forth.

01:01:17.932 --> 01:01:19.558
I thought you were dead.

01:01:23.103 --> 01:01:24.688
Why have you come back

01:01:24.730 --> 01:01:27.441
when nobody
wants to see you?

01:01:27.483 --> 01:01:29.944
You mustn't speak
to Little Big Man like that.

01:01:29.944 --> 01:01:31.278
You owe him a life.

01:01:35.699 --> 01:01:37.785
I'm glad I said it. Hello.

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:39.619
That was supposed to mean

01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:41.829
he was sorry he said it,
good-bye.

01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:47.126
But that warrior wasn't sorry.
He hated me still.

01:01:49.087 --> 01:01:50.046
Grandfather,

01:01:50.088 --> 01:01:52.382
I have a white wife.

01:01:52.423 --> 01:01:54.759
You do?

01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:57.637
That's interesting.

01:01:57.637 --> 01:02:01.641
Does she cook
and does she work hard?

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.351
Oh, yes, Grandfather.

01:02:03.393 --> 01:02:05.769
That surprises me.

01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:10.232
Does she show pleasant
enthusiasm when you mount her?

01:02:11.984 --> 01:02:14.570
Well, sure, Grandfather.

01:02:14.611 --> 01:02:17.239
That surprises me even more.

01:02:17.281 --> 01:02:18.865
I tried one of them once

01:02:18.907 --> 01:02:24.162
but she didn't show
any enthusiasm at all.

01:02:29.917 --> 01:02:34.255
Well, Grandfather,
all the whites aren't crazy.

01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.135
I'm glad to hear that, my son.

01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:41.512
I thought they were.

01:02:41.512 --> 01:02:42.513
Oh, no.

01:02:45.057 --> 01:02:50.187
I know of one who is
as brave as any Human Being.

01:02:50.229 --> 01:02:53.816
I'd like to meet this man
and smoke with him.

01:02:53.858 --> 01:02:55.567
What is he called?

01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:58.445
He's called General Custer.

01:02:58.486 --> 01:03:01.573
General Custer.

01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:05.035
What does the name mean, my son?

01:03:05.035 --> 01:03:08.747
Well, it, it means...

01:03:08.788 --> 01:03:10.624
long hair.

01:03:10.665 --> 01:03:12.834
Good name.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:14.544
How did he win it?

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:16.796
He won it in the war

01:03:16.838 --> 01:03:20.758
of the whites
to free the black men.

01:03:20.799 --> 01:03:23.719
Oh, yes.

01:03:23.761 --> 01:03:26.555
The black white man.

01:03:26.555 --> 01:03:28.807
I know of them.

01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:33.729
It is said a black white man
once became a Human Being.

01:03:33.771 --> 01:03:36.649
But mostly they are
strange creatures.

01:03:39.193 --> 01:03:46.407
Not as ugly as the white, true,
but they're just as crazy.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:03:59.170
Don't worry, my son.

01:03:59.212 --> 01:04:01.256
You'll return
to the Human Beings.

01:04:01.297 --> 01:04:03.258
I dreamed it last night.

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:05.635
I saw you and your wives

01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:07.971
as you crawled
from one to the other

01:04:08.012 --> 01:04:09.471
in your tepee.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.390
Wives, Grandfather?

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:12.599
Oh, yes.

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:14.893
Three or four.

01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:17.229
It was dark

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.565
and they were hidden
under buffalo robes.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:20.899
But it was

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:23.068
a great copulation, my son.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:28.907
Grandfather,
the Human Beings

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.742
only take one wife.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.244
How could I have three or four?

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:35.913
I don't know.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:38.416
It worries me.

01:05:00.312 --> 01:05:04.441
I was sure
I'd never see him again.

01:05:04.482 --> 01:05:06.610
Sir, I expect being a scout

01:05:06.651 --> 01:05:09.696
is the best way for me
to find my wife, General.

01:05:09.738 --> 01:05:12.324
She was captured by the Cheyenne
due to our going west,

01:05:12.365 --> 01:05:13.950
just like you advised.

01:05:13.992 --> 01:05:15.869
I advised? That's impossible.

01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:17.829
I've never set eyes
on you before.

01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:20.498
Oh, I wouldn't figure
you'd remember me, sir.

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:22.876
Furthermore, you don't
look like a scout to me.

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:24.460
Not a bit.

01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:26.754
A scout has
a certain appearance.

01:05:26.795 --> 01:05:28.881
Kit Carson, for example.

01:05:29.006 --> 01:05:30.799
But you don't have it.

01:05:30.841 --> 01:05:31.842
You look like...

01:05:31.884 --> 01:05:33.552
a mule skinner.

01:05:33.594 --> 01:05:35.012
Well, I don't know

01:05:35.012 --> 01:05:36.722
anything about
mules, sir.

01:05:36.764 --> 01:05:37.848
It's a remarkable thing,

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:39.600
but I can tell
the occupation of a man

01:05:39.642 --> 01:05:40.809
merely by looking at him.

01:05:40.851 --> 01:05:41.852
Notice the bandy legs.

01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:42.895
Hmm?

01:05:42.978 --> 01:05:44.313
Strong arms.

01:05:44.355 --> 01:05:47.650
This man has spent years
with mules.

01:05:48.733 --> 01:05:50.318
Isn't that correct?

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.486
Well, I...

01:05:53.529 --> 01:05:54.489
Yes, sir.

01:05:56.532 --> 01:05:57.575
Hire the mule skinner!

01:05:57.617 --> 01:05:59.077
Yes, sir.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.041
Over here.

01:06:05.083 --> 01:06:06.251
Come on.

01:06:08.378 --> 01:06:09.629
Did you just hear what he said?

01:06:09.671 --> 01:06:10.964
Supposed to hire you.

01:06:12.965 --> 01:06:14.550
I wouldn't want
no wife of mine back

01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:16.218
after she'd been
with the Injuns.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.845
Kindest thing,
a bullet in the brain.

01:06:18.929 --> 01:06:21.139
Well, I don't agree.

01:06:21.181 --> 01:06:23.183
And I want my wife back.

01:06:23.225 --> 01:06:25.227
Well...

01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:27.563
one of the Pawnee located

01:06:27.563 --> 01:06:29.273
a band of the vermin

01:06:29.314 --> 01:06:31.358
camped down the river.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:33.151
We ride in the morning!

01:06:35.153 --> 01:06:37.697
Is-Is there, is there
any white women with them?

01:06:53.921 --> 01:06:55.131
Now my advice to you

01:06:55.172 --> 01:06:57.216
is to get yourself
a little revenge

01:06:57.258 --> 01:06:58.801
on them bucks.

01:07:01.095 --> 01:07:02.430
All right.

01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:04.055
Spare the females and children,

01:07:04.097 --> 01:07:05.056
if possible.

01:07:05.098 --> 01:07:06.558
Let's go.

01:07:29.663 --> 01:07:30.581
No!

01:07:33.209 --> 01:07:34.251
Hey!

01:07:34.293 --> 01:07:35.002
No!

01:07:35.711 --> 01:07:36.629
Hey!

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.258
He said spare the women
and children!

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.593
Give me that!

01:07:42.635 --> 01:07:43.761
Let go of my rifle!

01:07:43.802 --> 01:07:44.845
The hell I will.

01:07:55.647 --> 01:07:56.856
You've killed
the women and babies!

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:58.733
You bastard!
You son of a bitch!

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.151
Let go of my horse!

01:08:00.193 --> 01:08:01.319
Call 'em back, sir!

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:04.948
You'll hang for this!

01:08:39.564 --> 01:08:41.983
It was downright discouraging.

01:08:42.024 --> 01:08:44.986
If it wasn't the Indians
trying to kill me for a white,

01:08:45.027 --> 01:08:49.240
it was the whites trying
to kill me for an Indian.

01:08:52.368 --> 01:08:54.412
It made me sick.

01:08:54.453 --> 01:08:56.956
The Pawnee scouts
and soldiers both

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:59.207
was killing
everything in sight.

01:09:12.888 --> 01:09:13.680
Shadow!

01:09:14.389 --> 01:09:15.515
Brother, let's talk.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.457
You'll be took care of later.

01:09:42.499 --> 01:09:45.252
I'm saving you for the hanging.

01:09:45.294 --> 01:09:49.381
There's no describing
how I felt.

01:09:49.423 --> 01:09:52.343
An enemy had saved my life
by the violent murder

01:09:52.384 --> 01:09:55.554
of one of my best friends.

01:09:55.596 --> 01:10:00.558
The world was too ridiculous
even to bother to live in.

01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:42.349
That was why Shadow was there,

01:10:42.391 --> 01:10:44.768
and that was why
he'd fought so hard.

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:47.728
I sat there
and watched that baby

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:50.439
come into this world.

01:10:53.317 --> 01:10:56.988
Except for her breathing,
that woman never made a sound.

01:10:57.071 --> 01:10:58.447
If woman she was.

01:10:58.489 --> 01:11:02.785
She didn't look
more than a girl.

01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:21.684
I couldn't take my eyes

01:11:21.684 --> 01:11:24.602
off of that girl and her baby.

01:11:28.106 --> 01:11:30.358
All right,
let's get the hell out.

01:11:30.358 --> 01:11:31.608
Let the Pawnee clean up.

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.527
Bugler, assemble our troop!

01:11:35.696 --> 01:11:37.156
Listen to me.

01:11:37.197 --> 01:11:43.161
If you are kin to Shadow...
then you know of Little Big Man.

01:11:43.202 --> 01:11:47.123
I was a friend
of the Human Beings

01:11:47.165 --> 01:11:50.417
until they stole my wife.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.589
Are you Shadow's wife?

01:11:58.174 --> 01:12:01.010
His daughter?

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.807
Where is your husband?

01:12:07.849 --> 01:12:10.727
Killed.

01:12:17.691 --> 01:12:20.027
What's your name?

01:12:20.027 --> 01:12:22.070
Sunshine.

01:12:22.153 --> 01:12:25.656
I'm going to
take you with me...

01:12:25.698 --> 01:12:27.408
and trade you

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.534
for my wife.

01:12:36.375 --> 01:12:38.334
Clear them bushes, Younger.

01:12:44.673 --> 01:12:46.925
Move on. Nobody here.

01:12:46.966 --> 01:12:49.803
Let's get the hell out.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:28.712
Wait here, woman.

01:13:33.425 --> 01:13:34.926
Hello, Grandfather.

01:13:38.011 --> 01:13:39.471
Greetings, my son.

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:41.932
Do you want to eat?

01:13:50.106 --> 01:13:51.566
Grandfather?

01:13:51.607 --> 01:13:55.861
What happened to your neck,
Grandfather?

01:13:55.902 --> 01:13:57.654
It's a wound.

01:13:57.696 --> 01:13:59.072
It cut the tunnel

01:13:59.114 --> 01:14:01.365
through which light travels
to the heart.

01:14:05.911 --> 01:14:09.706
You... you mean you're blind?

01:14:09.748 --> 01:14:11.624
Oh, no.

01:14:11.624 --> 01:14:14.836
My eyes still see.

01:14:14.878 --> 01:14:18.047
But my heart no longer
receives it.

01:14:21.967 --> 01:14:24.428
How did it happen?

01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.471
White man.

01:14:31.225 --> 01:14:32.602
Where's Buffalo Wallow Woman?

01:14:32.643 --> 01:14:34.811
Rubbed out.

01:14:34.853 --> 01:14:37.814
And White Elk Woman, too.

01:14:37.856 --> 01:14:40.150
And Dirt on the Nose.

01:14:40.192 --> 01:14:41.360
And High Wolf.

01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:43.277
And many others.

01:14:43.319 --> 01:14:44.987
And Burns Red?

01:14:46.322 --> 01:14:47.573
Yes.

01:14:49.408 --> 01:14:51.159
Burns Red in the Sun?

01:14:51.201 --> 01:14:54.204
Rubbed out.

01:14:54.245 --> 01:14:58.208
His wife... his children...

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:00.834
and many more.

01:15:00.876 --> 01:15:02.920
Do you hate them?

01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:04.296
Do you hate

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:06.507
the white man now?

01:15:12.178 --> 01:15:15.556
Do you see this fine thing?

01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:19.142
Do you admire
the humanity of it?

01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:22.229
Because the Human Beings,
my son,

01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:25.314
they believe
everything is alive.

01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:30.820
Not only man and animals,

01:15:30.861 --> 01:15:33.029
but also water, earth, stone,

01:15:33.071 --> 01:15:39.202
and also the things from them,
like that hair.

01:15:39.244 --> 01:15:42.871
The man
from whom this hair came,

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:46.458
he's bald on the other side

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.794
because I now own his scalp.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:55.758
That is the way things are.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:16:00.345
But the white men,

01:16:00.387 --> 01:16:04.516
they believe
everything is dead:

01:16:04.558 --> 01:16:07.143
Stone, earth, animals,

01:16:07.184 --> 01:16:08.853
and people.

01:16:08.894 --> 01:16:11.939
Even their own people.

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:18.236
If things keep trying to live,
white man will rub them out.

01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:24.700
That is the difference.

01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:40.922
You will stay with us...

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:42.966
my son.

01:16:56.019 --> 01:17:00.774
A year later,
I was still with 'em.

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:04.360
After wandering all over,
in constant danger

01:17:04.401 --> 01:17:08.697
of being killed by white
settlers or white soldiers,

01:17:08.739 --> 01:17:13.785
we come to a place
knowed as the Indian Nations.

01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:18.206
It was a tract of land
by the Washita River

01:17:18.247 --> 01:17:23.085
that had been gived forever
to the Indians by the Congress

01:17:23.085 --> 01:17:26.421
and the President
of the United States.

01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:30.049
We was safe there.

01:17:30.091 --> 01:17:34.845
This was Indian land.

01:17:34.887 --> 01:17:38.848
As long as grass growed
and wind blow

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:42.769
and the sky is blue.

01:17:46.855 --> 01:17:49.900
Your new son's
kicking a lot today.

01:17:49.942 --> 01:17:52.069
I think he wants to come out
and see his father.

01:17:54.112 --> 01:17:58.783
Tell him to wait
until I finish my dinner.

01:17:58.825 --> 01:18:01.661
I'll tell him, but I don't think
he's going to wait much longer.

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.835
It's a good thing
I have a strong, brave husband

01:18:10.876 --> 01:18:12.420
who brings in so much

01:18:12.461 --> 01:18:13.963
game and food.

01:18:13.963 --> 01:18:16.549
Mm-hmm.

01:18:16.590 --> 01:18:17.800
My strong husband

01:18:17.842 --> 01:18:19.968
brings in much more
than we need.

01:18:38.026 --> 01:18:39.485
There are many
Human Beings here.

01:18:39.527 --> 01:18:40.862
Many bands

01:18:40.903 --> 01:18:42.405
from many places.

01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:44.990
But it's sad.

01:18:45.032 --> 01:18:47.034
Many husbands
have been rubbed out

01:18:47.075 --> 01:18:48.160
by the white man.

01:18:49.494 --> 01:18:51.330
It is sad because women

01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:52.705
sleep alone and cry.

01:18:52.747 --> 01:18:54.081
Be quiet now.

01:18:54.165 --> 01:18:56.625
I'm digesting.

01:19:04.507 --> 01:19:07.010
Yes, but I think
my sisters are here.

01:19:07.052 --> 01:19:09.136
Your what?!

01:19:11.555 --> 01:19:13.432
My sisters.

01:19:13.474 --> 01:19:14.641
Digging Bear, Little Elk

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:15.809
and Corn Woman.

01:19:15.851 --> 01:19:17.226
I think they're here.

01:19:17.268 --> 01:19:19.687
What do you mean,
you think they're here?

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:21.230
I believe they are.

01:19:21.272 --> 01:19:22.398
You bring in

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:23.858
much more food than we need.

01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:26.568
It is very sad.

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:28.528
They have no husbands

01:19:28.528 --> 01:19:29.780
and they cry.

01:19:29.821 --> 01:19:31.698
Well, that's too bad;
I'm sorry.

01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:34.325
Digging Bear had a baby
and lost it.

01:19:34.367 --> 01:19:36.494
And so did Corn Woman.

01:19:36.535 --> 01:19:38.537
But Little Elk
had no baby at all.

01:19:38.579 --> 01:19:40.748
All right, what do you want me
to do about it?

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:44.250
I knew you'd understand.

01:20:05.228 --> 01:20:08.230
It was Old Lodge Skins' dream
trying to come true.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:26.246
I was determined to stay out
of them buffalo robes.

01:20:26.287 --> 01:20:29.416
Three young and healthy women

01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:33.794
with no man
for who knows how long. Mmm.

01:20:33.836 --> 01:20:37.214
The very idea kind of shrunk me

01:20:37.256 --> 01:20:40.217
like a spider on a hot stove.

01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:42.385
Why, it's Little Big Man!

01:20:42.427 --> 01:20:45.763
Oh, Little Big Man!

01:20:47.015 --> 01:20:50.308
Younger Bear,
it's Little Big Man!

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:54.396
He's not a Contrary anymore.

01:20:54.438 --> 01:20:55.731
He has a wife.

01:20:56.939 --> 01:21:01.569
She's plump, she works hard,
but she henpecks him.

01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:04.238
Just when I think you are dead,
and the buzzards have eaten you,

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.613
you always come back.

01:21:05.655 --> 01:21:08.491
Yes, and I always will
till you pay me

01:21:08.533 --> 01:21:10.285
the life you owe me.

01:21:11.453 --> 01:21:13.579
I've heard you.

01:21:19.209 --> 01:21:20.419
Now, come to my tepee

01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:22.295
and eat.

01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:25.048
We was caught
in Cheyenne hospitality.

01:21:25.089 --> 01:21:27.675
I'm a very important man.

01:21:27.717 --> 01:21:30.302
More important than you.

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:33.513
I have a wife
and four horses.

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:38.060
I have a horse
and... four wives.

01:21:39.977 --> 01:21:42.480
Well, that may be.

01:21:42.521 --> 01:21:47.984
But... my wife,
she's a very good one.

01:21:47.984 --> 01:21:49.152
See?

01:21:53.573 --> 01:21:54.866
Oh, so

01:21:54.908 --> 01:21:57.368
there you are,
you crawling coyote.

01:21:57.409 --> 01:21:58.619
What are we going to eat, huh?

01:21:58.661 --> 01:21:59.703
This starved duck?

01:22:03.498 --> 01:22:05.625
Oh...

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:07.168
Oh, who's the foolish beggar

01:22:07.168 --> 01:22:09.796
you brought to steal
what little food we have?

01:22:09.837 --> 01:22:12.172
Clean it, clean it!

01:22:12.172 --> 01:22:13.507
Ooh!

01:22:13.507 --> 01:22:16.051
It was Olga.

01:22:16.093 --> 01:22:18.387
I had found her at last.

01:22:18.428 --> 01:22:20.388
One duck.

01:22:20.429 --> 01:22:22.348
Olga never did learn
much English

01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:24.684
but she sure in hell
had learned Cheyenne.

01:22:24.684 --> 01:22:28.478
I, I, I just
don't understand it.

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.481
Usually, this woman is...

01:22:31.523 --> 01:22:33.650
gentle as a dove.

01:22:39.488 --> 01:22:41.198
My words were not the words

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.992
to speak to a stranger.

01:22:43.033 --> 01:22:44.660
You stay and eat.

01:22:48.871 --> 01:22:51.207
You see what a good wife she is?

01:22:51.207 --> 01:22:53.875
It's because
I'm a wonderful lover.

01:22:53.917 --> 01:22:55.502
Go in my tepee.

01:22:55.544 --> 01:22:56.920
She will cook this duck for you.

01:22:56.962 --> 01:22:58.839
That's all right;
I'm not hungry.

01:23:03.259 --> 01:23:05.594
You've humiliated him again.

01:23:08.597 --> 01:23:12.684
Good-bye, Younger Bear.

01:23:17.063 --> 01:23:19.315
You look tired, Little Big Man.

01:23:19.356 --> 01:23:21.817
Do you want
to come into my tepee

01:23:21.859 --> 01:23:25.696
and rest on soft furs?

01:23:25.738 --> 01:23:29.073
Why don't you live with me,
and I'll be your wife?

01:23:29.115 --> 01:23:32.076
Thank you for inviting me.

01:23:34.995 --> 01:23:39.333
Well, I've got to fix my hair
to sing tonight.

01:23:39.374 --> 01:23:42.753
Good-bye, Little Big Man.

01:23:42.753 --> 01:23:45.755
Good-bye, Little Horse.

01:23:45.755 --> 01:23:51.093
And so I finally found Olga.

01:23:51.135 --> 01:23:54.846
I'd lost her long ago
to the Human Beings,

01:23:54.846 --> 01:24:00.142
and I saw no good reason
to reveal myself to her now.

01:24:02.394 --> 01:24:03.479
Grandfather!

01:24:05.522 --> 01:24:07.858
Why have you moved your tepee
so far from our band?

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.485
The ponies are trying
to tell me something.

01:24:17.449 --> 01:24:20.035
Last night I had a dream.

01:24:20.118 --> 01:24:22.746
The ponies were dying.

01:24:22.788 --> 01:24:25.873
I heard them scream.

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:31.921
I'd learned to respect
Old Lodge Skins' dreams,

01:24:31.963 --> 01:24:34.923
but for once,
we were in a safe place,

01:24:34.965 --> 01:24:36.800
give to us by a treaty.

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:05.117
Why do you hate my sisters?

01:25:07.076 --> 01:25:10.246
I don't hate your sisters, I...

01:25:10.288 --> 01:25:13.582
It... it's just that...

01:25:13.624 --> 01:25:15.583
the Great Spirit...

01:25:17.627 --> 01:25:20.964
tells me...

01:25:22.924 --> 01:25:25.009
Where are you going?

01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:28.304
Your son won't wait any longer.

01:25:28.345 --> 01:25:30.597
He wants to come out
and see his father.

01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:40.939
Sunshine, Indian style,
was going off to have her baby.

01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:47.696
As I watched her walk away,
it come over me

01:25:47.738 --> 01:25:54.285
that the Great Spirit wanted me
to go in that tepee.

01:26:18.181 --> 01:26:20.516
Who wants to be first?

01:26:33.319 --> 01:26:34.445
Who's this here?

01:26:34.487 --> 01:26:35.655
It's me.

01:26:37.865 --> 01:26:39.824
Well, I...

01:26:39.866 --> 01:26:42.494
guess you'll do as well as any.

01:26:42.535 --> 01:26:45.038
I figured
she was the littlest one,

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:48.040
and it would be easy.

01:26:49.708 --> 01:26:53.170
But Lord help us,
them young girls is deadly.

01:26:54.796 --> 01:26:58.841
However, the Great Spirit
was with me...

01:26:58.883 --> 01:27:00.802
and I survived.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.097
Only thing was,

01:27:05.138 --> 01:27:08.558
just as I was about
to drift off real peaceful...

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:20.902
No, you stay.

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.112
Not yet.

01:27:22.153 --> 01:27:24.114
Maybe I can get back later.

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:27.367
Idle boasting, I assure you.

01:27:29.952 --> 01:27:31.120
Who's this here?

01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:35.416
It's me, Digging Bear.

01:27:43.298 --> 01:27:46.925
Well, she wasn't called
Digging Bear for nothing,

01:27:46.967 --> 01:27:48.927
I can tell you that.

01:28:01.896 --> 01:28:03.315
Stay here.

01:28:03.356 --> 01:28:05.400
Corn Woman's too tired.

01:28:05.442 --> 01:28:06.568
Oh.

01:28:09.362 --> 01:28:12.615
She don't sound tired to me.

01:28:12.656 --> 01:28:13.824
That's not her.

01:28:13.866 --> 01:28:15.326
That's Little Elk.

01:28:15.367 --> 01:28:16.994
That's both of them.

01:28:17.119 --> 01:28:18.578
Little Elk, you go on to sleep.

01:28:19.871 --> 01:28:22.123
You, too.

01:28:22.123 --> 01:28:24.334
Digging Bear!

01:28:30.464 --> 01:28:32.716
Corn Woman, where are you?

01:28:37.678 --> 01:28:42.141
I was lucky
I come across her last.

01:28:58.322 --> 01:29:00.490
The others, too?

01:29:02.158 --> 01:29:04.118
Yes.

01:29:13.001 --> 01:29:15.170
I knew you were a good man.

01:29:22.927 --> 01:29:25.011
Here's your new son.

01:29:32.394 --> 01:29:34.853
I reckon right then

01:29:34.853 --> 01:29:37.898
I come pretty close
to turning pure Indian,

01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:41.651
and I probably would have spent
the rest of my days

01:29:41.693 --> 01:29:44.028
with Sunshine and her sisters.

01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:48.658
But sometimes grass don't grow,
wind don't blow...

01:29:50.575 --> 01:29:52.369
...and the sky ain't blue.

01:29:53.412 --> 01:29:54.997
Something's wrong
with the ponies.

01:29:55.122 --> 01:29:56.999
Wolves.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:29:58.708
Grandfather's d... Here!

01:29:58.749 --> 01:29:59.917
Go inside.

01:29:59.959 --> 01:30:03.296
Don't leave the tepee.

01:30:19.226 --> 01:30:21.687
Grandfather,
what's wrong with the ponies?

01:30:21.729 --> 01:30:23.688
Don't you hear that, my son?

01:31:45.594 --> 01:31:48.096
I wonder why I didn't see them
in my dream.

01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:51.099
Sunshine!

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.393
Sunshine!

01:32:13.618 --> 01:32:16.997
Grandfather,
you've got to get inside.

01:32:17.038 --> 01:32:18.915
Why bother, son?

01:32:18.957 --> 01:32:20.040
It's a good day to die.

01:32:26.755 --> 01:32:29.173
We've got to get
to the riverbank!

01:32:32.844 --> 01:32:33.469
I am blind.

01:32:33.553 --> 01:32:34.846
I cannot fight.

01:32:36.305 --> 01:32:38.181
But I won't run.

01:32:38.223 --> 01:32:39.016
If it's

01:32:39.057 --> 01:32:40.017
my day to die,

01:32:40.058 --> 01:32:41.935
I want to do it here
within a circle.

01:32:44.186 --> 01:32:46.272
Grandfather...

01:32:46.314 --> 01:32:50.818
the river is part
of the great circle

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.612
of the waters of the Earth.

01:32:53.653 --> 01:32:55.071
That's true,

01:32:55.113 --> 01:32:56.489
but the soldiers would kill us

01:32:56.531 --> 01:32:57.991
before we could get
to the river.

01:32:58.033 --> 01:33:01.452
The sol...? Grandfather,
you didn't see any soldiers

01:33:01.493 --> 01:33:04.163
in your dream,
and-and that means that...

01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:06.165
that they can't see you now.

01:33:06.206 --> 01:33:08.208
You think so?

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:09.542
Yes, yes.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.044
What else did your dream mean?

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:12.462
I think you're right.

01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:15.006
Then let's go to the great
circle of the river!

01:33:15.048 --> 01:33:16.549
Invisible.

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.884
I never been invisible before.

01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:22.512
It's too late.

01:33:22.554 --> 01:33:23.680
We're cut off.

01:33:23.722 --> 01:33:24.765
It doesn't matter.

01:33:24.806 --> 01:33:26.307
We're invisible.

01:33:26.349 --> 01:33:28.726
Grandfather, wait!

01:33:33.898 --> 01:33:34.689
Grandfather!

01:33:41.154 --> 01:33:42.947
I know it sounds ridiculous

01:33:42.988 --> 01:33:47.076
but them soldiers never
lifted a hand to stop us.

01:33:47.201 --> 01:33:50.079
I reckon it was so crazy,
they couldn't figure it out.

01:33:50.204 --> 01:33:51.955
Or maybe they thought

01:33:51.996 --> 01:33:54.916
we was prisoners
or even friendlies

01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:56.834
since Old Lodge Skins
was grinning at them

01:33:56.876 --> 01:33:58.503
like a raccoon.

01:34:05.634 --> 01:34:09.929
Or maybe
we really was invisible.

01:34:09.971 --> 01:34:11.973
All I knowed is we walked

01:34:12.014 --> 01:34:14.559
right through 'em to the river.

01:34:42.791 --> 01:34:45.627
Circle the camp!
Circle the camp, boys!

01:34:46.878 --> 01:34:48.463
That was extremely enjoyable.

01:34:48.505 --> 01:34:49.630
Glad you liked it

01:34:49.672 --> 01:34:50.715
Grandfather.

01:34:53.718 --> 01:34:55.887
Captain!

01:34:59.598 --> 01:35:00.974
Captain...

01:35:01.975 --> 01:35:03.643
...shoot the Indian ponies.

01:35:03.685 --> 01:35:05.145
I beg your pardon, sir?

01:35:05.145 --> 01:35:06.395
That is my decision.

01:35:06.437 --> 01:35:08.606
- I shall shoot the ponies.
- But, sir!

01:35:08.647 --> 01:35:10.316
- Sunshine...
- Go and do it!

01:35:10.316 --> 01:35:11.317
Yes, sir.

01:35:15.153 --> 01:35:17.614
Young man,
your self-righteous piety

01:35:17.655 --> 01:35:19.490
is commencing to annoy me.

01:35:19.532 --> 01:35:21.826
But l-I didn't
say anything, sir.

01:35:21.868 --> 01:35:24.411
You think it's shocking
to shoot a few ponies?

01:35:24.453 --> 01:35:25.871
Well, let me tell you,

01:35:25.913 --> 01:35:28.832
the women are far more important
than the ponies.

01:35:28.874 --> 01:35:30.958
The point is,
they breed like rats,

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.669
however, Lieutenant,
this is a legal action.

01:35:33.711 --> 01:35:38.007
And the men are under strict
orders not to shoot the women.

01:35:38.049 --> 01:35:41.509
Unless, of course,
they refuse to surrender.

01:35:44.095 --> 01:35:45.180
Isn't that correct?!

01:35:45.222 --> 01:35:46.306
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

01:36:40.019 --> 01:36:41.688
Sunshine!

01:36:43.106 --> 01:36:45.275
Run! Run!

01:36:50.279 --> 01:36:51.321
Run!

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:53.739
No!

01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:55.741
No!

01:38:02.217 --> 01:38:03.676
Where you going, soldier?

01:38:03.718 --> 01:38:05.511
Message for the General.

01:38:05.553 --> 01:38:06.596
Wait a minute.

01:38:06.638 --> 01:38:08.931
What's that on your face?

01:38:09.014 --> 01:38:11.183
Oh, mud, sir.

01:38:11.308 --> 01:38:12.184
That's not mud,
that's Indian paint.

01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:17.355
And that's an Indian knife.

01:38:17.396 --> 01:38:19.524
What's your company?

01:38:19.565 --> 01:38:21.025
My company, sir?

01:38:21.067 --> 01:38:23.569
Yes, and the name of
your commanding officer.

01:38:23.611 --> 01:38:24.987
What's the trouble, Captain?

01:38:25.029 --> 01:38:26.863
I think we've got

01:38:26.905 --> 01:38:28.240
a renegade, General.

01:38:28.281 --> 01:38:29.366
He's wearing Indian paint

01:38:29.407 --> 01:38:30.909
and he doesn't know
his commanding officer

01:38:30.951 --> 01:38:32.035
or his company.

01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.286
Take him away and hang him.

01:38:34.328 --> 01:38:35.412
General!

01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:38.249
General, don't you remember me?

01:38:39.375 --> 01:38:40.960
I'm Jack Crabb,
the mule skinner!

01:38:41.001 --> 01:38:43.419
Mule skinner?

01:38:43.461 --> 01:38:44.420
Yes, sir!

01:38:44.462 --> 01:38:46.589
I applied for a job as scout,

01:38:46.631 --> 01:38:47.632
but you could tell

01:38:47.674 --> 01:38:49.717
my true occupation
just by looking at me.

01:38:52.386 --> 01:38:55.305
Yes, yes, I believe
I do remember that.

01:38:57.015 --> 01:38:59.058
How did you become a renegade?

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:02.812
General...
I ain't no renegade!

01:39:02.854 --> 01:39:06.440
I was captured by the Cheyenne
and held prisoner!

01:39:06.482 --> 01:39:10.318
Why, they...
they took cactus thorns

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:11.695
and stuck them in me!

01:39:11.736 --> 01:39:12.863
But I just laughed

01:39:12.904 --> 01:39:14.364
and begged them

01:39:14.406 --> 01:39:16.824
to keep on doing it!

01:39:16.866 --> 01:39:19.243
You... laughed?

01:39:19.285 --> 01:39:20.578
I laughed my head off!

01:39:20.619 --> 01:39:22.413
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

01:39:28.209 --> 01:39:32.337
Gentlemen, it is difficult
to admit to an error.

01:39:32.379 --> 01:39:33.672
Captain?

01:39:40.177 --> 01:39:42.680
Captain, your summary judgment

01:39:42.722 --> 01:39:44.432
was wholly mistaken!

01:39:44.473 --> 01:39:46.684
Now aren't you glad I saw fit

01:39:46.726 --> 01:39:49.227
to question this
man more closely?

01:39:49.269 --> 01:39:50.270
Yes, sir.

01:39:52.898 --> 01:39:56.359
Please be more careful
in the future, Captain.

01:41:08.798 --> 01:41:10.591
I'll drink the tea now,
Corporal.

01:41:10.633 --> 01:41:11.716
Yes, sir.

01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:24.520
What are you doing
up here, mule skinner?

01:41:24.562 --> 01:41:29.649
Nothing, I...
just brought you tea, General.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.660
And I wanted to...
thank you again

01:41:41.702 --> 01:41:44.413
for sparing my life.

01:41:48.332 --> 01:41:52.378
Why are you standing
to the side?

01:41:54.045 --> 01:41:55.839
Turn this way.

01:42:21.904 --> 01:42:27.867
You came up here
to kill me, didn't you?

01:42:28.993 --> 01:42:30.828
And you lost your nerve.

01:42:34.707 --> 01:42:37.667
Well, I was correct, in a sense.

01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:39.252
You are a renegade,

01:42:39.294 --> 01:42:42.506
but you are no Cheyenne brave.

01:42:44.006 --> 01:42:46.217
Custer was right.

01:42:46.258 --> 01:42:50.763
I was a total failure
as an Indian.

01:42:50.804 --> 01:42:53.765
Do I hang you?

01:42:53.806 --> 01:42:54.933
I think not.

01:42:54.974 --> 01:42:56.643
Get out of here.

01:42:59.895 --> 01:43:02.064
You're not going to hang me?

01:43:02.105 --> 01:43:04.691
Your miserable life
is not worth

01:43:04.733 --> 01:43:07.611
the reversal
of a Custer decision.

01:43:12.073 --> 01:43:17.160
That was the worst thing
he could have done to me.

01:43:22.499 --> 01:43:25.960
There was nothing left
of my self-respect at all.

01:43:31.799 --> 01:43:34.467
I couldn't go back
to the Indians

01:43:34.509 --> 01:43:38.721
so I went back among
the whites and become a drunk.

01:43:47.646 --> 01:43:51.065
Boy, you're a sad sight, Hoss.

01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:53.359
You should have stuck
to sody-pop.

01:44:00.949 --> 01:44:03.118
How are things with you, Bill?

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.119
Fine.

01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:05.996
I've changed my ways, Hoss.

01:44:06.121 --> 01:44:08.706
That's good.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.001
Say, Bill,

01:44:12.084 --> 01:44:15.128
I need a drink worse than
a breath of life itself.

01:44:17.547 --> 01:44:19.257
- Here's $20.
- Oh!

01:44:19.299 --> 01:44:21.718
Get gloriously drunk.

01:44:21.759 --> 01:44:24.678
But first, go across
the street to the barber,

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:27.556
and have yourself a bath,
and buy some clothes.

01:44:27.598 --> 01:44:29.016
Then come see me in the saloon.

01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:32.935
One thing I do know, Hoss,

01:44:32.977 --> 01:44:35.855
any damn fool
can drink himself to death.

01:44:43.737 --> 01:44:45.530
Come on. Come on!

01:45:09.051 --> 01:45:10.344
Bill, I want to...

01:45:10.385 --> 01:45:12.262
Hoss, I'd like to ask you
a confidential favor.

01:45:12.304 --> 01:45:16.307
It's a delicate matter
involving a-a widow.

01:45:24.064 --> 01:45:27.526
She needs a train ticket
out of town.

01:45:27.567 --> 01:45:29.402
You give her this.

01:45:29.527 --> 01:45:30.361
Sure, Bill.

01:45:30.402 --> 01:45:32.363
See, my new, beautiful wife

01:45:32.404 --> 01:45:34.532
is violently jealous,

01:45:34.573 --> 01:45:39.327
and... and this widow,
oh, she's quite a widow.

01:45:39.369 --> 01:45:42.539
I think I know
what you mean, Bill.

01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:43.581
Her name was Lulu Kane.

01:45:43.623 --> 01:45:44.999
Right now, Bill.

01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:47.000
Good.

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:08.520
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:09.563
Get out of the way!

01:46:09.563 --> 01:46:10.564
Bill! Bill...

01:46:10.605 --> 01:46:12.148
He killed my daddy!

01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:14.775
He killed my daddy!
He killed my daddy!

01:46:14.817 --> 01:46:16.735
He's never gonna shoot
nobody again!

01:46:16.735 --> 01:46:17.611
Took me seven years

01:46:17.653 --> 01:46:18.863
to get him, but I got him!

01:46:31.582 --> 01:46:33.250
Who was he anyhow?

01:46:33.292 --> 01:46:35.085
Some boy.

01:46:38.838 --> 01:46:41.966
Hoss...

01:46:43.092 --> 01:46:46.553
...you know that matter
we discussed?

01:46:46.595 --> 01:46:47.637
The widow?

01:46:47.679 --> 01:46:49.097
Yes, Bill.

01:46:49.139 --> 01:46:53.225
Don't tell my wife.

01:46:53.267 --> 01:46:56.520
That'd really get me in trouble.

01:47:09.157 --> 01:47:15.245
You've got me down
in this goldang water!

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:23.920
Come in, stranger.

01:47:23.961 --> 01:47:25.171
Whatever it is you want,

01:47:25.213 --> 01:47:27.839
we've got it.

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:32.844
Miss Pendrake?

01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:47.190
You've mistaken me
for someone else, stranger.

01:47:47.232 --> 01:47:50.026
My name is Lulu.

01:47:52.611 --> 01:47:53.737
Your name ain't Lulu.

01:47:53.779 --> 01:47:55.531
You're Louise Pendrake.

01:47:59.742 --> 01:48:01.410
Who-who are you?

01:48:01.452 --> 01:48:04.956
Well, I am Jack Crabb.

01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.960
Miss Pendrake,
don't you remember me?

01:48:10.001 --> 01:48:13.588
Jack Crabb?

01:48:16.632 --> 01:48:18.259
My God.

01:48:23.639 --> 01:48:26.850
Jack.

01:48:26.891 --> 01:48:28.184
Well, this is quite

01:48:28.226 --> 01:48:29.853
a pleasant surprise.

01:48:29.894 --> 01:48:33.147
Th-this room
is more commodious.

01:48:34.439 --> 01:48:36.441
And now, wh-what have you
been doing with yourself?

01:48:36.483 --> 01:48:38.110
Lulu! What the hell
are you doing in here

01:48:38.152 --> 01:48:39.820
sitting on your ass?

01:48:39.862 --> 01:48:41.696
There's a
gentleman waiting.

01:48:41.737 --> 01:48:43.823
I have a gentleman
in here, too.

01:48:43.865 --> 01:48:46.451
Oh, I didn't see you, stranger.

01:48:46.492 --> 01:48:47.493
Is everything
all right?

01:48:47.535 --> 01:48:49.162
- Oh, everything's fine.
- Need anything?

01:48:49.203 --> 01:48:50.203
If you do, just ring the bell.

01:48:50.245 --> 01:48:51.788
Our motto here is

01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:54.291
"Whatever you want,
we've got it."

01:49:02.965 --> 01:49:04.633
Well, Jack.

01:49:04.675 --> 01:49:06.217
Now you know.

01:49:07.385 --> 01:49:14.475
This is a house of ill fame,
and I'm a fallen flower.

01:49:14.516 --> 01:49:17.853
That widow hadn't lost
her style one bit.

01:49:17.895 --> 01:49:20.314
"A fallen flower."

01:49:20.355 --> 01:49:22.899
Chokes me up to think about it.

01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:27.487
This life is not only wicked
and sinful,

01:49:27.528 --> 01:49:30.656
it isn't even any fun.

01:49:30.698 --> 01:49:33.950
No, I reckon, I reckon not,
Miss Pendrake.

01:49:33.992 --> 01:49:35.285
If I was married

01:49:35.327 --> 01:49:38.246
and could come here
once or twice a week,

01:49:38.288 --> 01:49:39.914
well, it might be fun.

01:49:39.955 --> 01:49:43.375
But every night?
It's just boring.

01:49:43.417 --> 01:49:46.337
Oh, I can understand that.

01:49:47.379 --> 01:49:49.714
I can't seem to save any money.

01:49:49.756 --> 01:49:52.592
Well, if I could just
save a few dollars

01:49:52.634 --> 01:49:54.010
I could go to visit

01:49:54.052 --> 01:49:57.221
my-my maiden aunt in Washington.

01:49:57.262 --> 01:50:01.183
New clothes, a carriage.

01:50:01.225 --> 01:50:03.894
And who knows,
I might even marry a senator.

01:50:03.936 --> 01:50:07.647
Oh! You'd make a good wife
for a senator

01:50:07.688 --> 01:50:09.190
Miss Pendrake.

01:50:09.232 --> 01:50:13.193
You always were a sweet boy.

01:50:18.073 --> 01:50:20.033
Do you know,

01:50:20.075 --> 01:50:23.536
I often had wicked thoughts
about you?

01:50:23.577 --> 01:50:24.578
Huh?

01:50:24.578 --> 01:50:26.038
Oh, yes.

01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.040
Several times.

01:50:28.082 --> 01:50:32.168
I almost gave in to temptation.

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:35.380
And now... here we are.

01:50:40.926 --> 01:50:43.720
Miss Pendrake,
what are you doing?

01:50:43.762 --> 01:50:47.557
Do you know that once
I tiptoed into your room,

01:50:47.598 --> 01:50:51.436
and stood over you
for the longest time?

01:50:51.436 --> 01:50:55.772
It was the most awful
temptation to wake you up.

01:50:58.275 --> 01:51:01.236
I wish that I had.

01:51:01.278 --> 01:51:05.781
It would have been
deliciously wicked.

01:51:07.241 --> 01:51:09.743
Is anything
the matter, Jack?

01:51:09.785 --> 01:51:11.244
No.

01:51:11.286 --> 01:51:14.497
Then I'll wait for you in the...

01:51:14.539 --> 01:51:17.167
place of retirement.

01:51:37.225 --> 01:51:39.895
You should have
woke me up that night

01:51:39.895 --> 01:51:41.897
years ago, Miss Pendrake.

01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:48.569
This is from Wild Bill.

01:51:48.611 --> 01:51:50.070
It was his last wish

01:51:50.154 --> 01:51:52.697
that you go to Washington
and live with your maiden aunt.

01:51:55.408 --> 01:51:56.993
His last wish

01:51:57.035 --> 01:52:00.371
was to save me?

01:52:04.082 --> 01:52:05.709
Oh, Jack.

01:52:05.793 --> 01:52:09.128
I must honor that wish.

01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:11.589
You can do it, Miss Pendrake.

01:52:11.631 --> 01:52:13.716
Yes, I can...

01:52:13.758 --> 01:52:16.552
and I will.

01:52:16.594 --> 01:52:17.886
I got to go now.

01:52:18.929 --> 01:52:20.555
Good-bye, Miss Pendrake.

01:52:20.597 --> 01:52:22.224
Oh, good-bye, Jack.

01:52:22.265 --> 01:52:26.227
And thank you ever so much.

01:52:26.268 --> 01:52:27.728
Oh, and Jack...

01:52:30.981 --> 01:52:32.233
...if you're ever

01:52:32.274 --> 01:52:38.238
in Washington, do look me up.

01:52:49.123 --> 01:52:50.623
How are things with you,

01:52:50.665 --> 01:52:51.958
Mr. Meriweather?

01:52:51.958 --> 01:52:53.126
Splendid.

01:52:57.713 --> 01:52:58.964
Well, now, look at that.

01:52:58.964 --> 01:53:00.132
Buffalo hides.

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:01.591
There's a world of money

01:53:01.633 --> 01:53:03.760
chewing grass
on those plains, Jack.

01:53:03.844 --> 01:53:09.348
There goes
Buffalo Bill himself.

01:53:09.390 --> 01:53:10.850
Oh...

01:53:10.891 --> 01:53:12.435
Yes, sir.

01:53:12.476 --> 01:53:14.145
Multiply that by thousands.

01:53:14.186 --> 01:53:16.980
Little Jack, the buffalo
is getting scarce.

01:53:17.021 --> 01:53:18.231
You were raised by Indians.

01:53:18.273 --> 01:53:19.774
You should
know how to track them.

01:53:19.858 --> 01:53:21.276
Yeah, but...

01:53:21.317 --> 01:53:22.861
We could make a killing, Jack.

01:53:34.996 --> 01:53:36.956
Haven't changed a bit, Jack.

01:53:36.998 --> 01:53:38.624
Neither have you.

01:53:38.666 --> 01:53:40.792
You'd better watch out,
Mr. Meriweather.

01:53:40.834 --> 01:53:43.003
They're whittlin' you down
pretty serious.

01:53:43.003 --> 01:53:46.006
You can't afford to lose
any more of your parts.

01:53:46.131 --> 01:53:49.717
Every business
has a particle of risk.

01:53:49.759 --> 01:53:52.136
Bye, dear boy.

01:54:02.562 --> 01:54:04.481
That was my low.

01:54:04.522 --> 01:54:06.356
I had reached the bottom.

01:54:12.696 --> 01:54:14.906
I'd become a hermit.

01:54:14.947 --> 01:54:19.077
I went deep in the wilderness,
as far away as I could get.

01:54:37.218 --> 01:54:38.552
Then one day,

01:54:38.552 --> 01:54:42.889
I found something
trappers see fairly regular.

01:54:42.931 --> 01:54:47.643
An animal had gnawed off
its own foot

01:54:47.684 --> 01:54:50.687
to escape from the trap.

01:54:54.733 --> 01:54:56.275
Something snapped in my head.

01:54:56.317 --> 01:55:02.156
I decided
life wasn't fit to live

01:55:02.198 --> 01:55:03.865
and the only thing to do

01:55:03.907 --> 01:55:06.743
was to mingle
with the twinkling stars.

01:55:14.208 --> 01:55:17.711
Good-bye, Jack.

01:55:17.753 --> 01:55:20.880
Good-bye, Little Big Man.

01:55:20.922 --> 01:55:21.881
At that moment,

01:55:21.965 --> 01:55:24.426
I really was crazy

01:55:24.467 --> 01:55:27.929
and I was darn near
off that cliff when...

01:55:52.743 --> 01:55:58.247
The time had come
to look the devil in the eye

01:55:58.289 --> 01:56:01.542
and send him to hell
where he belonged.

01:56:02.876 --> 01:56:04.627
The only question was,

01:56:04.627 --> 01:56:07.172
how to get him there?

01:56:10.591 --> 01:56:13.302
Sergeant, take this man...

01:56:15.804 --> 01:56:18.098
...and give him some clothes.

01:56:24.312 --> 01:56:27.147
This man will be invaluable
to me, Major.

01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:29.066
Invaluable, sir?

01:56:29.107 --> 01:56:31.985
I almost hanged that man
as a renegade.

01:56:32.069 --> 01:56:34.863
Now, he asks me for a job
as a scout.

01:56:34.905 --> 01:56:36.822
Oh, his game

01:56:36.822 --> 01:56:39.700
is very obvious... to lead me
away from his Indian friends.

01:56:39.742 --> 01:56:43.703
I still don't quite
follow you, General.

01:56:46.164 --> 01:56:49.542
Anything that man tells me
will be a lie.

01:56:49.584 --> 01:56:53.587
Therefore, he will be
a perfect reverse barometer.

01:56:58.801 --> 01:57:00.176
Isn't that correct?

01:57:00.218 --> 01:57:01.677
Of course, General.

01:57:14.689 --> 01:57:17.691
Move them out, men. Ho!

01:57:31.955 --> 01:57:34.748
In my belief,
Custer's hate for the Indians

01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:38.335
and his ambition
had combined on him.

01:57:38.377 --> 01:57:42.296
He figured he needed one more

01:57:42.338 --> 01:57:44.549
dramatic victory
over the Indians

01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:47.969
to be nominated for
President of the United States.

01:57:48.052 --> 01:57:50.554
That is a true historical fact.

01:57:50.595 --> 01:57:52.723
Men, hold!

01:57:52.764 --> 01:57:54.558
We will take brief refreshment.
Water only!

01:57:54.558 --> 01:57:56.309
Dismount!

01:57:56.351 --> 01:57:58.894
Water break!

01:58:09.237 --> 01:58:10.864
Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.

01:58:10.905 --> 01:58:13.908
It's the celibacy of the saddle.

01:58:13.950 --> 01:58:15.409
I had muscle spasms all night.

01:58:17.995 --> 01:58:19.872
The poison from the goo-nads.

01:58:19.913 --> 01:58:21.373
Poison from the what, sir?

01:58:22.666 --> 01:58:26.377
Goo-nads.
That's medical terminology.

01:58:26.419 --> 01:58:27.754
General, it's my duty as your...

01:58:35.052 --> 01:58:36.928
The poison rises
from the goo-nads

01:58:36.970 --> 01:58:40.056
to the throat and then seeps
down to various muscles.

01:58:40.097 --> 01:58:42.641
General...

01:58:42.683 --> 01:58:43.851
the Crows want to know

01:58:43.893 --> 01:58:46.520
if you're going down
in the Medicine Tail Coulee.

01:58:46.562 --> 01:58:48.646
Oh, they do, do they?

01:58:48.688 --> 01:58:50.273
Yes, sir, they do.

01:58:50.315 --> 01:58:53.109
They claim they want time
to sing their death song.

01:58:53.151 --> 01:58:56.570
Tell the Crows they're women!

01:58:56.612 --> 01:58:59.531
But, sir...

01:58:59.573 --> 01:59:01.450
if the hostiles
come in behind us,

01:59:01.492 --> 01:59:04.495
and if they're
waiting for us down below,

01:59:04.536 --> 01:59:05.787
we'll never get out of there.

01:59:05.828 --> 01:59:07.830
Hostiles behind us?

01:59:07.872 --> 01:59:09.415
I see no hostiles behind us.

01:59:09.457 --> 01:59:11.250
Do you see any hostiles
behind us, Major?

01:59:11.292 --> 01:59:12.335
No, sir, not at the moment...

01:59:12.377 --> 01:59:13.668
Then, then, then...

01:59:14.628 --> 01:59:16.296
...stop trying to cause

01:59:16.338 --> 01:59:18.715
a reversal
of a Custer decision.

01:59:18.757 --> 01:59:22.301
But, sir, wouldn't it...
wouldn't it be best

01:59:22.343 --> 01:59:24.387
to send a squad down
Medicine Tail Coulee?

01:59:24.428 --> 01:59:25.638
No, it wouldn't.

01:59:25.679 --> 01:59:27.139
But, sir...

01:59:27.181 --> 01:59:30.850
may I ask, sir, why it wouldn't?

01:59:30.892 --> 01:59:34.562
Because Major, it would cost us
the vital element of surprise.

01:59:34.604 --> 01:59:37.732
Surprise? General,
they know we're here.

01:59:37.774 --> 01:59:38.982
Yes, but they don't know

01:59:39.108 --> 01:59:41.485
that I intend to attack them
without mercy.

01:59:41.527 --> 01:59:43.987
But, General,
that's no surprise.

01:59:44.113 --> 01:59:45.114
Of course it is.

01:59:45.155 --> 01:59:46.989
Nothing is this world
is more surprising

01:59:47.031 --> 01:59:48.491
than the attack without mercy.

01:59:50.201 --> 01:59:51.369
General...

01:59:51.369 --> 01:59:55.706
General, I must protest
this impetuous decision.

02:00:03.838 --> 02:00:05.756
A Custer decision, impetuous?

02:00:05.798 --> 02:00:10.136
Grant called me impetuous, too!

02:00:10.177 --> 02:00:11.678
The drunkard.

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:13.513
Sitting there
in the White House,

02:00:13.555 --> 02:00:15.765
calling me impetuous!

02:00:15.807 --> 02:00:20.185
General, General,
I implore you to reconsider.

02:00:20.185 --> 02:00:24.857
Think of the men
whose lives depend upon you.

02:00:34.615 --> 02:00:38.243
What do you think
I should do, mule skinner?

02:00:38.285 --> 02:00:40.203
Sir, that man
doesn't know anything.

02:00:42.039 --> 02:00:44.832
What do you say, mule skinner?

02:00:44.874 --> 02:00:49.962
Should I go down there
or withdraw?

02:00:50.004 --> 02:00:53.673
I had him.

02:00:53.715 --> 02:00:55.258
But this time

02:00:55.300 --> 02:00:58.011
what I held in my hand
wasn't a knife

02:00:58.053 --> 02:00:59.846
but the truth.

02:00:59.888 --> 02:01:01.722
Well?

02:01:01.764 --> 02:01:03.557
What's your answer,
mule skinner?

02:01:03.599 --> 02:01:09.979
General...

02:01:10.021 --> 02:01:12.190
you go down there.

02:01:16.694 --> 02:01:19.571
You're advising me
to go into the Coulee?

02:01:19.613 --> 02:01:20.572
Yes, sir.

02:01:20.614 --> 02:01:23.784
There are no Indians there,
I suppose?

02:01:23.825 --> 02:01:25.702
I didn't say that.

02:01:25.744 --> 02:01:30.373
There are thousands
of Indians down there.

02:01:30.414 --> 02:01:32.708
And when they get done with you,

02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:35.627
there won't be nothing left
but a greasy spot.

02:01:35.668 --> 02:01:39.881
This ain't the Washita
River, General.

02:01:39.923 --> 02:01:44.385
And them ain't helpless women
and children waiting for you.

02:01:44.426 --> 02:01:47.513
They're Cheyenne brave
and Sioux.

02:01:50.057 --> 02:01:54.227
You go down there
if you got the nerve.

02:01:54.268 --> 02:01:58.981
Still trying to outsmart me,
aren't you, mule skinner?

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:04.820
You want me to think that you
don't want me to go down there,

02:02:04.861 --> 02:02:06.446
but the subtle truth is,

02:02:06.488 --> 02:02:09.782
you really don't want me
to go down there.

02:02:11.575 --> 02:02:15.329
Well, are you
reassured now, Major?

02:02:24.212 --> 02:02:27.965
Men of the seventh!

02:02:28.048 --> 02:02:34.762
The hour of victory
is at hand!

02:02:34.804 --> 02:02:41.852
Onward to Little Big Horn
and glory!

02:03:28.018 --> 02:03:30.145
We've caught them napping!

02:03:30.187 --> 02:03:32.271
Sound the charge!

02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.754
We have them on the run, men!

02:04:02.715 --> 02:04:04.966
Take no prisoners!

02:04:30.906 --> 02:04:33.409
Now we've got them, men!

02:05:46.264 --> 02:05:47.682
Men, Custer's with you!

02:05:47.724 --> 02:05:49.934
Custer's honor!
Stay with me!

02:05:55.481 --> 02:05:57.066
What are they doing?

02:05:57.107 --> 02:05:58.067
Why aren't they charging?

02:05:58.108 --> 02:06:00.152
There's nowhere to charge to!

02:06:04.155 --> 02:06:07.116
Fight! Stand up and fight!

02:06:11.953 --> 02:06:14.498
Fools! They're shooting
their own horses.

02:06:14.539 --> 02:06:16.750
Arrest them! Arrest them!

02:06:16.792 --> 02:06:19.460
Bugler! Sound the charge!

02:06:19.502 --> 02:06:21.337
We've got to make breast-works!

02:06:21.379 --> 02:06:22.880
I know all about that, Major.

02:06:22.922 --> 02:06:25.174
Don't try to tell me
my business.

02:06:25.216 --> 02:06:28.343
Make breast-works, men!

02:06:46.734 --> 02:06:48.486
Show them no mercy!

02:06:50.321 --> 02:06:52.739
I said, give them a volley!

02:06:54.324 --> 02:06:56.702
We're running out of ammunition,
General.

02:06:56.702 --> 02:06:57.828
Right!

02:06:57.869 --> 02:06:59.245
Now, we are running

02:06:59.286 --> 02:07:00.997
out of ammunition.

02:07:01.038 --> 02:07:02.039
I told him

02:07:02.039 --> 02:07:03.374
this would happen.

02:07:03.374 --> 02:07:06.711
But he just sat there...
in the White House

02:07:06.711 --> 02:07:08.253
and laughed at me!

02:07:08.294 --> 02:07:10.255
That damn Cossack.

02:07:15.343 --> 02:07:16.343
This is horrible...

02:07:17.469 --> 02:07:18.554
We're being wiped out!

02:07:20.139 --> 02:07:24.642
For Christian America...

02:07:24.684 --> 02:07:27.478
Let your arrows fly, savages!

02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:29.522
I am unbowed!

02:07:36.236 --> 02:07:38.822
Mr. President...

02:07:38.864 --> 02:07:40.198
Mr. President...

02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:42.616
Distinguished visitors...

02:07:44.160 --> 02:07:46.120
honored members of the Senate!

02:07:46.162 --> 02:07:48.205
Taking the Indian
as we find him,

02:07:48.247 --> 02:07:50.957
- waiting...
- Oh, why don't you shut up?

02:07:50.999 --> 02:07:54.252
Mr. President, you are drunk.

02:07:55.462 --> 02:07:58.547
We can't have a man like you
in the White House!

02:07:59.506 --> 02:08:02.176
Get on your feet
and face the enemy!

02:08:02.217 --> 02:08:04.762
Go away, General.

02:08:04.803 --> 02:08:06.304
All right.

02:08:06.346 --> 02:08:08.389
The sentence is death.

02:09:08.943 --> 02:09:11.404
All right...

02:09:11.445 --> 02:09:13.446
then you know you and I
are even at last.

02:09:13.488 --> 02:09:15.490
I paid you the life I owe you.

02:09:15.532 --> 02:09:16.700
And the next time we meet,

02:09:16.741 --> 02:09:19.411
I can kill you
without becoming an evil person.

02:09:34.048 --> 02:09:36.718
He goes to dance his joy.

02:09:37.843 --> 02:09:39.386
Grandfather.

02:09:39.428 --> 02:09:42.973
I am glad to see you.

02:09:43.015 --> 02:09:46.809
Glad to see you,
too, my son.

02:09:46.851 --> 02:09:50.688
My heart soars like a hawk.

02:09:50.688 --> 02:09:53.649
Do you want to eat?

02:09:53.691 --> 02:09:56.401
I won't eat with you,

02:09:56.443 --> 02:09:58.695
because I'm going to die soon.

02:09:58.737 --> 02:10:01.906
Die, Grandfather?

02:10:01.948 --> 02:10:03.157
Yes, my son.

02:10:03.198 --> 02:10:05.909
I want to die
in my own land

02:10:05.951 --> 02:10:10.080
where Human Beings
are buried in the sky.

02:10:12.874 --> 02:10:16.502
Well, why do you
want to die, Grandfather?

02:10:16.544 --> 02:10:18.421
Because there's no other way

02:10:18.463 --> 02:10:20.839
to deal with the white man,
my son.

02:10:20.881 --> 02:10:24.009
Whatever else
you can say about them

02:10:24.092 --> 02:10:25.927
it must be admitted:

02:10:25.969 --> 02:10:28.387
You cannot get rid of them.

02:10:33.017 --> 02:10:38.021
No, I suppose not, Grandfather.

02:10:38.063 --> 02:10:41.858
There is an endless supply
of white man

02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:43.859
but there always has been

02:10:43.901 --> 02:10:46.528
a limited number
of Human Beings.

02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:49.907
We won today.

02:10:53.076 --> 02:10:55.912
We won't win tomorrow.

02:11:06.672 --> 02:11:10.758
Snake Woman, get me
my Elk burial robe.

02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:18.765
Come, my son.

02:11:18.765 --> 02:11:20.767
We will go.

02:11:26.355 --> 02:11:28.440
It makes my heart sad.

02:11:28.482 --> 02:11:33.112
A world without Human Beings
has no center to it.

02:11:33.153 --> 02:11:35.613
Go where, Grandfather?

02:11:35.655 --> 02:11:37.782
To the mountain.

02:11:37.824 --> 02:11:39.284
To the top.

02:12:45.675 --> 02:12:48.219
Come out and fight!

02:12:48.261 --> 02:12:50.971
It is a good day to die!

02:12:52.806 --> 02:12:57.143
Thank you for making me
a Human Being!

02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:04.108
Thank you for helping me
to become a warrior.

02:13:06.318 --> 02:13:12.115
Thank you for my victories...
and for my defeats.

02:13:13.658 --> 02:13:17.161
Thank you for my vision...

02:13:17.286 --> 02:13:22.540
and the blindness
in which I saw further.

02:13:25.543 --> 02:13:27.170
You make all things

02:13:27.212 --> 02:13:31.298
and direct them in their ways,
oh, Grandfather.

02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:36.512
And now, you have
to silence the Human Beings!

02:13:36.553 --> 02:13:40.348
We'll soon walk a road...

02:13:43.851 --> 02:13:47.229
...that leads nowhere.

02:14:04.703 --> 02:14:12.668
I am going to die now,
unless death wants to fight.

02:14:12.710 --> 02:14:15.963
And I ask you for the last time

02:14:16.005 --> 02:14:22.844
to grant me my old power
to make things happen.

02:14:40.943 --> 02:14:44.155
Take care of my son, here.

02:14:44.196 --> 02:14:47.866
See that he doesn't go crazy.

02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:37.451
Grandfather?

02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:53.590
Am I still in this world?

02:15:53.632 --> 02:15:55.592
Yes, Grandfather.

02:16:04.267 --> 02:16:06.560
I was afraid of that.

02:16:08.436 --> 02:16:16.319
Well, sometimes the magic works,
sometimes it doesn't.

02:16:43.843 --> 02:16:47.680
Let's go back to the tepee
and eat, my son.

02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.308
My newest snake wife
cooks dog very well.

02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:53.476
All right, Grandfather.

02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:58.772
She also has
a very soft skin.

02:16:58.814 --> 02:17:03.152
The only trouble
with snake women

02:17:03.192 --> 02:17:08.656
is they copulate with horses,
which makes them strange to me.

02:17:08.698 --> 02:17:12.869
She says she doesn't,
that's why I call her

02:17:12.869 --> 02:17:14.912
"Doesn't Like Horses."

02:17:15.037 --> 02:17:18.206
But of course, she's lying.

02:17:19.708 --> 02:17:22.294
Of course, Grandfather.

02:17:24.587 --> 02:17:31.635
Well, that's the story
of this old Indian fighter.

02:17:33.053 --> 02:17:36.598
That's the story
of the Human Beings,

02:17:36.639 --> 02:17:41.894
who was promised land where they
could live in... peace.

02:17:41.936 --> 02:17:45.105
Land that would be theirs...

02:17:45.147 --> 02:17:48.733
as long as grass grow...

02:17:48.775 --> 02:17:52.111
wind blow...

02:17:52.153 --> 02:17:54.112
and the sky is blue.

02:17:54.155 --> 02:18:00.494
Mr. Crabb, I didn't know...

02:18:00.535 --> 02:18:03.163
Get out, get out.
