WEBVTT

00:07.124 --> 00:10.342
So, how is Peru?

00:16.717 --> 00:19.518
- I've heard of that.
- Isn't that guinea pig?

00:19.520 --> 00:23.022
Never mind.

00:23.024 --> 00:26.225
The roof caved in.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.277
There's guys working
up there right now.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.029
Atchoo!

00:30.031 --> 00:31.780
No.

00:31.782 --> 00:35.117
It's nothing, it's just dust.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.354
Zoe, I'm fine, OK?
Just have fun,

00:39.356 --> 00:41.373
and I'll talk to you
in a couple of days.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.411
What?

00:49.667 --> 00:51.667
Zoe, spit it out.

00:59.343 --> 01:01.477
"We" as in who?

01:05.433 --> 01:06.982
Zoe!

01:11.772 --> 01:13.939
OK, where is this happening?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.175 --> 01:33.041
I didn't know Zoe had a cousin.

01:33.043 --> 01:34.843
Apparently,
they're pretty close.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.795
Zoe actually lived
with Donnie's family

01:36.797 --> 01:38.797
for three years
after her parents died.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.635
You... did know
that Zoe's parents died

01:43.637 --> 01:46.271
when she was a teenager?
Yeah, sure.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.941
Wow! Boss of the year

01:48.943 --> 01:51.443
right here.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.445
I just wish
she would have given us

01:53.447 --> 01:56.198
some more notice. Why? It's not
like we can hang around the agency.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.451
- Don't remind me.
- How long is that gonna go on by the way?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.904
The contractor said they
should be done sometime today.

02:01.906 --> 02:04.239
Perfect! Then, there's
nothing for us to do,

02:04.241 --> 02:06.909
except relax and enjoy
the festivities.

02:06.911 --> 02:09.127
Speaking of which,
where is this tea shop?

02:09.130 --> 02:11.747
It's right up there.
Just pull over.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.310
Thank you!

02:25.312 --> 02:27.896
The Chinese Valentine's Day?

02:27.898 --> 02:30.015
Better than a lame box
of drugstore chocolates.

02:30.017 --> 02:32.017
I thought women loved those.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.735
- Atchoo!
- Coming down with something?

02:33.737 --> 02:35.938
No. It's just dust
from construction,

02:35.940 --> 02:38.106
it's nothing. Whatever you say.

02:43.414 --> 02:47.416
Let me guess. Shade and Angie?
Hi, I'm Tracy.

02:47.418 --> 02:50.836
Zoe's told me all about you.
Only good things I hope.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.672
Yep. Just give me
a minute to lock up,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.674
and I will take you to Donnie's.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.709
- You got a cold?
- No, I'm fine.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.795
- She's in denial.
- It's the tiniest tickle

02:59.797 --> 03:01.713
in my throat.
I got just the thing.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.216
- What's that?
- It's organic herbs,

03:04.218 --> 03:07.603
some ginger, eye of newt.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.055
- I'm just kidding.
- Wow, it's

03:10.057 --> 03:12.057
a beautiful shop you have here.
Thanks!

03:12.059 --> 03:14.109
My grandma taught me
everything I know.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.195
I never thought it would turn
into my career though.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.114
Actually, it was Donnie who
convinced me to follow my heart.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.316
Smells intriguing.

03:21.318 --> 03:23.569
Yeah, best to shoot it quick.

03:23.571 --> 03:27.239
Pretend it's tequila.
That I can do.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.960
That would be
the cayenne pepper talking.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.545
- A little chaser?
- Thanks.

03:36.700 --> 03:39.418
That's actually really good.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.470
I made it myself.
Crafted it in honour

03:41.472 --> 03:43.972
of the Seventh Night Festival.
It's for lovers.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.761
Well, should we get going?
Donnie's about to go on.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.147
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:01.692 --> 04:03.692
There he is. Donnie!

04:03.694 --> 04:05.894
Hey!

04:05.896 --> 04:07.696
Sorry to interrupt.
I wanted you to meet.

04:07.698 --> 04:09.748
Shade and Angie.
So happy you could make it.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.867
- Hear you're a great fighter.
- And teacher.

04:11.869 --> 04:14.419
- He's literally the best.
- And you're not biased at all.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.372
- Donnie!
- I've got to go prepare.

04:17.374 --> 04:21.176
I am honoured that you came
today. I'm a big fan of yours.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.296
- Enjoy the show.
- Thanks.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.798
Thank you

04:26.800 --> 04:29.417
for joining us
at Chi Sao Studio.

04:29.419 --> 04:32.804
And now, a man who needs
no introduction:

04:32.806 --> 04:34.523
Donnie Chow.

04:34.525 --> 04:36.808
That's Irving, Donnie's boss.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.727
He's been training Donnie
since he was 6.

04:38.729 --> 04:40.562
Thanks. Haha!

05:07.424 --> 05:10.309
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.265
- Donnie!
- Everybody, stay back!

05:17.267 --> 05:19.267
Is he breathing?

05:19.269 --> 05:22.487
- Barely.
- Call 9-1-1.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.272
Teetsa Jeung?

05:24.274 --> 05:27.492
- What is that?!
- It wasn't there 2 minutes ago.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.244
We need an ambulance,
Chi Sao Studio!

05:29.246 --> 05:32.080
- What are they saying?
- Teetsa Jeung.

05:32.082 --> 05:35.000
- What does that mean?
- Iron Palm.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.918
Someone just tried
to kill my boyfriend.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.697
Dr. Bisson, oncology.

06:22.699 --> 06:25.300
The contusion on his chest
suggests he suffered

06:25.302 --> 06:27.419
a serious blow.
There was no one near him

06:27.421 --> 06:30.172
when he collapsed.
We saw the whole thing.

06:30.174 --> 06:32.334
Sometimes, when a fighter
is struck, it's not evident

06:32.336 --> 06:34.136
until there's an increase
in blood flow.

06:34.138 --> 06:35.944
Especially
with internal bleeding.

06:35.946 --> 06:37.646
But that doesn't
explain his collapse.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.015
- What would?
- Heart attack, aneurysm,

06:40.017 --> 06:43.268
even heatstroke.
I've ordered a full blood panel

06:43.270 --> 06:45.687
and tox screen.
I'm gonna send Donnie down

06:45.689 --> 06:49.274
for some X-rays and an ECG.
We should know more soon.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.528
I don't know
if any doctor can help.

06:53.530 --> 06:56.698
- Why would you say that?
- Some people believe

06:56.700 --> 06:59.835
that the damage caused
by> Teetsa Jeung can't be undone.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.953
What exactly is> Teetsa Jeung?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.922
It translates to "Iron Palm."

07:03.924 --> 07:05.924
It's an advanced
martial arts technique.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.959
It involves harnessing
the body's kinetic energy

07:07.961 --> 07:10.679
into a single blow.
Supposedly, it can stop

07:10.681 --> 07:13.348
a person's heart,
even hours later.

07:13.350 --> 07:16.435
Sorry, this is nothing
to do with you.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.186
No, we're gonna help you
figure this out.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.939
Zoe is family,
that means Donnie is too.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.607
Iron Palm or not,
it seems that someone

07:22.609 --> 07:24.976
assaulted Donnie this morning.
Do you happen

07:24.978 --> 07:27.028
to know where he was
before the demonstration?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.064
Did he meet up with anyone
out of the ordinary?

07:29.066 --> 07:31.566
Um, I don't know.
He didn't come to the tea shop

07:31.568 --> 07:33.702
like he does every morning.
I usually make him

07:33.704 --> 07:35.737
an extra-large tea,
and then he goes to the studio.

07:35.739 --> 07:38.073
Maybe I can check his schedule.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.244
That's weird,
his password isn't working.

07:42.246 --> 07:44.296
Maybe he changed it.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.298
Things have been

07:46.300 --> 07:48.967
kind of tense lately.
We had a big fight

07:48.969 --> 07:52.387
last week, but I never thought
that he would shut me out.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.172
We have some friends
at the police station;

07:54.174 --> 07:56.057
We can try to get it
unlocked if you like.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.459
- Yeah.
- Donnie's boss...

07:58.461 --> 08:00.428
Irving. He might know more.

08:00.430 --> 08:03.315
We'll go talk to him.
We'll be in touch.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.189
You don't actually believe any
of this Iron Palm stuff, do you?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.191
I don't know. There's a lot
we don't understand

08:13.193 --> 08:15.694
about Eastern traditions.
I used acupuncture

08:15.696 --> 08:18.280
all through my hockey career.
Acupuncture is a long way

08:18.282 --> 08:20.415
from a magic death punch.
I don't know,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.334
haven't seen you
sneeze for a while.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.369
Shocking what
dust-free air will do.

08:24.371 --> 08:27.289
Or a shot of "magic" tea.

08:36.383 --> 08:40.217
Wow! So you wasn't kidding when
you said her cousin was good.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.220
I got your message.

08:47.561 --> 08:50.812
I knew from an early age that
Donnie was one in a million,

08:50.814 --> 08:52.564
best I'd ever seen.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.283
Donnie and I trained together
all over the world.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.620
That was Shaolin balance
training in Southern China.

08:58.622 --> 09:01.489
I was about to take him
on a massive competition tour.

09:01.491 --> 09:03.158
Fifty cities.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.210
I'm sorry.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.636
Thanks.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.671
Thank you for your help
this morning.

09:16.673 --> 09:18.673
I'm still in shock.

09:20.210 --> 09:23.511
Donnie's like a son to me.
Is that him as a kid?

09:23.513 --> 09:25.981
We went to Bangkok together.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.933
We're trying to piece together

09:27.935 --> 09:30.569
where Donnie was before the
demonstration, who he was with.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.988
He was here early
in the morning, then he left.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.774
Said he had to take care of something.
Any idea what that was?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.360
- He didn't tell me.
- A star like Donnie,

09:38.362 --> 09:40.161
he's bound to have
some enemies, right?

09:40.163 --> 09:42.614
Not really. Everybody loves him.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.507
Tony Wong.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.626
He runs a Wing Chun studio
not far from here.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.761
I can't believe he'd do
something like this.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.430
What's his issue with Donnie?

09:58.432 --> 10:01.049
Tony came from mainland China
a few years ago,

10:01.051 --> 10:03.051
spent a fortune on his studio,

10:03.053 --> 10:05.770
but people still flock
to train here. Not to mention,

10:05.772 --> 10:08.390
Donnie beat him in a sparring
match several months ago.

10:08.392 --> 10:10.525
They were supposed to have
a rematch this afternoon.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.952
The martial artist
doesn't need brute strength

10:20.954 --> 10:25.206
to defeat their enemy.
True power comes from the mind.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.916
If I were to leave him
in this state,

10:34.918 --> 10:37.335
within a few hours
his heart could stop.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.672
But then again, a good assistant
is hard to find.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.813
Come on.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.849
Thank you for coming
to our demonstration.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.984
If you want more information
on Bong Sao Academy,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.853
please take a pamphlet.

10:57.307 --> 11:00.942
Thank you so much.
Hi there. Thank you for coming.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.994
Wow! That was

11:02.996 --> 11:05.163
amazing! Hazel,
what did I tell you?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.248
This guy's like
a modern-day Bruce Lee.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.130
I'm glad you liked it.
There's a pass in there

11:09.132 --> 11:10.932
for a complimentary lesson.
Come check us out.

11:10.956 --> 11:12.587
I'd love to learn

11:12.589 --> 11:14.673
that "power of the mind" thing.
That was so cool!

11:14.675 --> 11:18.126
That was just a demonstration,
it's not something I teach.

11:18.128 --> 11:19.928
Only the best Sifu
can master it.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.630
And who is the best?
You or Donnie Chow?

11:22.632 --> 11:25.884
- Says here you were supposed to fight him this afternoon?
- No, Hazel, remember?

11:25.886 --> 11:28.219
We heard that Donnie's
in the hospital now.

11:28.221 --> 11:31.439
Wait. Say, someone wouldn't have done
that to him on purpose, would they?

11:31.441 --> 11:33.725
Are you implying
I did something to Donnie?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.447
Well, it'd be good
for business. You could

11:35.471 --> 11:38.229
eliminate the competition
and give away fewer freebies.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.699
If I would take out Donnie,
I'd do it publicly.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.701
There's no honour in doing it
behind the scenes.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.203
Unless you're worried
you were gonna lose.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.990
- Who are you two?
- Just a couple

11:48.992 --> 11:51.376
of interested patrons.
Say, where were you

11:51.378 --> 11:53.378
this morning?
I was giving a speech

11:53.380 --> 11:56.965
at the festival's opening
reception. As for your business,

11:56.967 --> 11:58.967
I'd advise you
to take it elsewhere.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.835
Excuse me.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.893
Well, now I feel like a jerk.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.895
- More than usual?
- Ha ha.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.897
Live tweets
from this morning's reception,

12:12.899 --> 12:15.716
Tony was definitely there.
So now what?

12:15.718 --> 12:18.737
Irving's studio has
security cameras, doesn't it?

12:18.739 --> 12:21.322
You think whoever did this to
Donnie was at the demonstration?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.358
It's worth a shot.
I'll text Irving.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.277
Hey, Dad.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.780
Where's the 4 quart soup tureen?

12:28.782 --> 12:33.034
- Hello to you too.
- Look, quit fooling around, OK? I'm in a hurry.

12:33.036 --> 12:35.336
Left side of the sink,
top cabinet?

12:35.338 --> 12:38.423
No, it's not.
I just checked there.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.344
There it is.

12:43.346 --> 12:46.765
- What's going on?
- It's the 9th Annual.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.801
Spring Lakes Soup Spectacular.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.936
They have an amateur division
and this year

12:51.938 --> 12:55.640
I am entering
my famous Fort Huron Gumbo.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.609
Well, good luck.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.979
- Son of a bitch!
- Is that Angie? What's wrong?

13:00.981 --> 13:03.648
The workers at the agency

13:03.650 --> 13:05.867
ran into a snag. It's gonna be
another day or two.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.439
Yeah, sure, Dad, I guess.

13:11.441 --> 13:12.773
What's he saying?

13:12.775 --> 13:14.775
He's saying you should
just stay at my place.

13:14.777 --> 13:17.328
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

13:17.330 --> 13:20.298
Jules is staying at Becca's,
and I'm leaving for.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.418
Spring Lake in about an hour.

13:23.420 --> 13:25.253
Just bring us back
a blue ribbon.

13:25.255 --> 13:27.222
Yeah, golden ladle,

13:27.224 --> 13:29.224
but I get your drift.
Thanks a lot. Take care.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.259
You know what?

13:31.261 --> 13:33.228
My dad's right, you should
just stay at my place.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.263
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got a guest room

13:35.265 --> 13:37.315
I never use.
It's got pillows and everything.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.317
OK. Thanks.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.319
- Look.
- What is it?

13:41.321 --> 13:44.355
It's a text from Tracy. She
went through Donnie's backpack,

13:44.357 --> 13:46.397
and she found this.
It's from a bakery in Chinatown.

13:46.399 --> 13:48.439
- Does she know what it says?
- She said it's a list

13:48.463 --> 13:50.523
of dates. No other information.

14:06.930 --> 14:10.014
Excuse me.
Um, do you recognize this?

14:12.135 --> 14:14.853
Um, could you wait here
a second?

14:18.275 --> 14:21.226
We're just gonna ask
some questions.

14:22.812 --> 14:24.312
Show me the photo.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.901
Who are you?
How did you get this?

14:29.903 --> 14:32.537
Why don't you tell us
what it is first.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.322
We should go now.

14:34.324 --> 14:36.574
Not until we get some answers.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.576
No, I think we should go now.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.166
Something tells me
that's not an option anymore.

14:53.084 --> 14:56.336
So, Philip and I were just
walking around enjoying

14:56.338 --> 14:58.788
the Seventh Night Festival
when he remembered this place.

14:58.790 --> 15:01.257
I have such fond memories
of your pineapple buns

15:01.259 --> 15:04.677
from our first date.
When was that?

15:04.679 --> 15:06.646
How many years
has it been, Philip?

15:06.648 --> 15:09.732
It's been so long. Five?

15:09.734 --> 15:13.820
We moved last summer.
Our previous location was,

15:13.822 --> 15:16.439
let's just say, too public.

15:16.441 --> 15:19.192
We're friends with Donnie Chow.

15:21.613 --> 15:24.581
Technically his cousin Zoe,
but we're acting on his behalf.

15:24.583 --> 15:27.367
- Acting how?
- We're

15:27.369 --> 15:29.869
trying to figure out what caused
his accident this morning.

15:29.871 --> 15:31.704
Yes. I'm sorry
to hear about that.

15:31.706 --> 15:34.924
His girlfriend Tracy found
this order slip in his bag.

15:34.926 --> 15:36.709
We're guessing he wasn't here

15:36.711 --> 15:40.346
to pick up egg tarts.
Did he owe you money?

15:40.348 --> 15:42.298
We all owe something.

15:51.192 --> 15:53.192
I'm writing you
a bad review on Yelp.

15:53.194 --> 15:56.779
- I'll be sure to pass it along.
- Yeah, you do that.

15:56.781 --> 15:59.449
OK, so how is Donnie involved

15:59.451 --> 16:01.451
with the Godmother of Chinatown?

16:01.453 --> 16:04.120
No idea. Let's go see Maz.

16:04.122 --> 16:07.790
Maz isn't here.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.660
He's on a training course.
Another one?

16:10.662 --> 16:13.046
What's with his sudden
interest in self-improvement?

16:13.048 --> 16:15.197
Last time Maz went
on a training course, it was to

16:15.199 --> 16:17.519
impress a Brazilian model with
his knowledge of Portuguese.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.168
OK. OK, you didn't
hear it from me,

16:19.170 --> 16:21.290
but I think he's applying
to join a secret task force.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.673
- "Task force"? For what?
- I don't know. He's being

16:23.675 --> 16:25.892
very hush-hush about it.
In the meantime,

16:25.894 --> 16:29.679
I'm holding down the fort.
Alright. We need some help.

16:29.681 --> 16:32.732
Can you get us some information
on this bakery in Chinatown?

16:32.734 --> 16:34.984
What kind of information?

16:34.986 --> 16:36.903
We think the woman
who owns it operates it

16:36.905 --> 16:38.855
as a front for something.

16:40.725 --> 16:44.027
OK, I'm logging in, but
I haven't agreed to help you.

16:49.784 --> 16:51.951
Yeah,

16:51.953 --> 16:54.120
we know the place. It's owned
by a woman named Li Chen.

16:54.122 --> 16:56.539
Is she a loan shark?

16:56.541 --> 16:59.292
No, more of a "fixer."
She helps rich kids

16:59.294 --> 17:01.928
from overseas get
into university here.

17:01.930 --> 17:04.347
So why the muscle?
We got tossed out of there

17:04.348 --> 17:07.183
by a couple of goons.
I don't know.

17:07.185 --> 17:10.019
She's had a couple of claims against
her, but nothing substantiated.

17:10.021 --> 17:12.501
Well then, we need a favour.
Can you get this phone unlocked?

17:12.525 --> 17:15.223
Belongs to Zoe's cousin, Donnie.
He was attacked.

17:15.226 --> 17:16.943
- Attacked?
- We think he may have

17:16.944 --> 17:19.145
met up with his attacker
earlier today.

17:20.699 --> 17:23.616
I don't know. I'd have
to take this to Forensics,

17:23.617 --> 17:26.953
and those guys
are very grouchy...

17:26.954 --> 17:30.573
Danica, Donnie's life
could be in danger.

17:30.575 --> 17:32.542
- Please.
- Right.

17:32.544 --> 17:35.795
Of course, yeah.
I'll take it to Forensics.

17:35.797 --> 17:38.664
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

17:41.386 --> 17:43.419
It's getting late.
Can you drop me off?

17:43.421 --> 17:45.254
Aren't you forgetting something?

17:45.256 --> 17:47.223
The agency is still toast.

17:47.225 --> 17:49.345
I wasn't kidding when I said
you could stay with me.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.677
We'll grab your bag on the way.
Are you sure

17:51.679 --> 17:53.596
that won't be too weird?
It'll only get weird

17:53.598 --> 17:55.631
if you want to watch
90s rom-coms and have

17:55.633 --> 17:57.817
a good cry.

18:02.741 --> 18:05.775
Alright, ready to go.

18:05.777 --> 18:07.777
Clean robe, fresh towels,

18:07.779 --> 18:09.779
en suite's in here,

18:09.781 --> 18:11.748
the hairdryer,

18:11.750 --> 18:13.482
mouthwash, dental floss.

18:13.484 --> 18:16.369
Anything else you need?
A mint on the pillow.

18:16.371 --> 18:19.455
Yeah, pillows, mints.

18:19.457 --> 18:21.674
Out of mints,
but I got lots of pillows.

18:21.676 --> 18:24.594
OK, make yourself at home.
I'll see you downstairs.

18:38.276 --> 18:40.193
You're... cooking.

18:40.195 --> 18:43.696
That's usually
what people do in a kitchen.

18:43.698 --> 18:46.732
I used to own
a restaurant, remember?

18:46.734 --> 18:48.701
Yeah, but I would have
totally paid for takeout.

18:48.703 --> 18:51.204
Hahaha! And rob me of the joy
of telling you what to do?

18:51.206 --> 18:53.206
Here, spiralize this zucchini.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.825
You've got it!
What does that mean?

18:55.827 --> 18:58.878
It means we're making

18:58.880 --> 19:01.164
pasta from zucchini. Here.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.583
- Is that a thing?
- It sure is.

19:03.585 --> 19:05.218
Turn that.

19:07.255 --> 19:09.672
- Cool!
- It's even better with wine.

19:09.674 --> 19:12.391
- Well, what isn't?
- Yeah, copy that.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.548
Why would Li Chen
lend money to Donnie

19:19.550 --> 19:22.518
and then try to kill him?
Doesn't make any sense.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.280
- Why else would he be there?
- I don't know.

19:24.304 --> 19:27.023
Maybe he needed
something "fixed"?

19:27.025 --> 19:29.358
It's a good thing we don't
actually live together.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.078
Yeah. We'd never stop working.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.498
Yeah.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.918
That's Irving. He just sent the link to
the security footage from this morning.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.087
Alright. Laptop's
in the living room, let's go.

19:43.842 --> 19:46.042
Nobody touches him
before he gets to the stage.

19:46.044 --> 19:48.794
Nothing.

19:48.796 --> 19:52.381
- My God!
- Everybody, stay back!

19:54.269 --> 19:57.720
Wait, did you see that?

19:57.722 --> 19:59.639
Watch. There!

19:59.641 --> 20:02.024
Black hoodie?

20:02.026 --> 20:04.861
Donnie goes down. The crowd
is shocked, can't turn away.

20:04.863 --> 20:08.030
Everybody except him.
And whoever he is, he's scared.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.352
And he's getting the hell
out of there as fast as he can.

20:10.376 --> 20:12.626
Almost as if he knew
what was coming.

20:26.885 --> 20:29.385
- Morning.
- Good morning!

20:29.387 --> 20:31.437
Coffee's hot.

20:34.893 --> 20:36.893
You put cinnamon on the grounds,

20:36.895 --> 20:38.645
- how'd you know?
- Psychic.

20:38.647 --> 20:40.864
But only
for beverage preferences.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.982
Also, I'm a PI
and I pay attention.

20:42.984 --> 20:45.869
Hahaha! You're
in a good mood this morning.

20:45.871 --> 20:49.155
That mattress was incredible,
it was like a seven-hour hug.

20:49.157 --> 20:51.658
- Memory foam.
- Honestly,

20:51.660 --> 20:53.376
I could sleep in your bed
every night.

20:53.378 --> 20:56.329
I could sleep in that bed.
The one in my guest...

20:56.331 --> 20:59.549
Your... The... Thank god!

20:59.551 --> 21:03.136
It's Tracy, and... I...

21:03.138 --> 21:05.505
I sent her a screen grab
of our mysterious hooded figure.

21:05.507 --> 21:07.140
- And?
- She doesn't recognize him.

21:07.142 --> 21:09.926
She says we should take it to Irving.
Let's go.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.270
Alright, OK.-

21:25.527 --> 21:28.194
- Hi! I...

21:28.196 --> 21:30.446
I'm Officer Danica Powers.

21:30.448 --> 21:32.198
Actually, I'm... Sorry, I'm

21:32.200 --> 21:34.617
a trainee detective,

21:34.619 --> 21:37.670
Danica Powers.
I'm not an officer,

21:37.672 --> 21:41.457
as you can probably tell from
my plain clothes, but...

21:41.459 --> 21:44.377
So, this is Forensics?

21:44.379 --> 21:46.429
Cool! I guess, yeah, obviously

21:46.431 --> 21:49.015
because it says Forensics, so...
And you guys have

21:49.017 --> 21:51.801
these nice forensic...
Please don't.

21:51.803 --> 21:53.686
OK, sorry.
I was actually thinking about

21:53.688 --> 21:56.639
going into forensics myself
because I love blood.

21:56.641 --> 21:58.674
Not in a weird way, just in a...

21:58.676 --> 22:00.977
just in a totally normal way.

22:00.979 --> 22:02.946
Anyway, I have
a bit of a favour to ask,

22:02.948 --> 22:06.115
and I'm a bit new here,
so I don't know how this goes.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.368
But...

22:08.370 --> 22:10.320
I have these friends,

22:10.322 --> 22:12.238
and they need
this phone unlocked.

22:12.240 --> 22:15.074
They are detectives,
but they're more

22:15.076 --> 22:17.327
sort of, um...

22:17.329 --> 22:20.830
They're more private. But that's
fair, they're private detectives.

22:20.832 --> 22:24.083
Well, one of them, her dad,
actually was a cop,

22:24.085 --> 22:26.085
but he is now

22:26.087 --> 22:28.338
dead. Um, sorry.

22:28.340 --> 22:31.007
Anyway, I need

22:31.009 --> 22:33.092
this phone unlocked

22:33.094 --> 22:36.229
for them, and if you were
to do this favour for me,

22:36.231 --> 22:38.598
I would be so grateful,
and I would

22:38.600 --> 22:41.317
owe you a favour. Obviously.

22:41.319 --> 22:45.021
If we do this,
will you please stop talking?

22:45.023 --> 22:47.523
Yes. Yes, I will.

22:47.525 --> 22:50.360
OK, yeah.

22:50.362 --> 22:53.780
Cool! I'm not supposed
to do that in a police station.

22:53.782 --> 22:56.582
Actually, I have a question
about passwords.

23:02.073 --> 23:04.040
Hey, Irving.

23:04.042 --> 23:06.509
Could you take a look
at something for us?

23:06.511 --> 23:08.127
Did you see something
in the footage?

23:08.129 --> 23:10.430
- Maybe.
- Do you know this person?

23:12.851 --> 23:16.219
- No. Did they hurt Donnie?
- We're not sure yet.

23:16.221 --> 23:19.188
I don't know who it is, but I can
tell you they practice Wing Chun.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.391
- How do you know?
- It's the brown sash.

23:21.393 --> 23:24.310
It denotes a skill level,
just like belts in karate.

23:24.312 --> 23:27.814
- Could it be one of your students?
- No. I'd recognize the posture.

23:27.816 --> 23:29.866
What about one of Tony's?

23:29.868 --> 23:33.536
It's possible. Excuse me,
my morning class is arriving.

23:37.158 --> 23:39.158
Alright, it makes sense.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.200
Tony establishes an alibi
for himself and then sends

23:41.224 --> 23:43.162
one of his minions
to do his dirty work.

23:43.164 --> 23:46.666
Let's go see if the student
became the master.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.504
Side kick! Ready? One!

23:51.506 --> 23:54.640
- Yah!
- Two! Hands up!

23:54.642 --> 23:56.142
- Three!
- Yah!

23:56.144 --> 23:57.560
- Four!
- Yah!

23:57.562 --> 23:59.228
- Five!
- Yah!

23:59.230 --> 24:01.514
- Six!
- Yah!

24:01.516 --> 24:04.484
- Seven! - Yah!
- Partner drills.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.437
You two again?
I had told you to stay away.

24:07.439 --> 24:09.772
My name's Angie Everett.
This is my partner Matt Shade.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.660
You still think
I attacked Donnie?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.612
We're actually looking
for a student of yours.

24:16.614 --> 24:18.664
- Ring a bell?
- Don't think so.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.534
Wanna take another look at that?

24:21.536 --> 24:23.453
You need to leave this alone.

24:23.455 --> 24:25.254
Is everything OK here, Sifu?

24:25.256 --> 24:27.173
I'm just looking
for my complimentary lesson.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.343
- It's been revoked.
- Maybe you should leave.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.830
Come on, Shade. Let's go
talk about this outside.

24:34.832 --> 24:36.799
Alright.

24:58.573 --> 25:00.540
I wonder who he's talking to.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.575
We definitely got him spooked.

25:02.577 --> 25:05.461
Let's sit on him for a bit,
see if our little bird flies the coop.

25:05.463 --> 25:08.881
Hey, can I stay again tonight?
The agency's still a war zone.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.000
Yeah, sure.
Are you gonna make dinner?

25:11.002 --> 25:14.253
Hell no! I start
and end with coffee.

25:14.255 --> 25:17.223
And now spiralized zucchini.

25:17.225 --> 25:19.892
Gotta hand it to you,
last night's dinner was pretty

25:19.894 --> 25:22.178
impressive.
I'm a pretty impressive guy.

25:22.180 --> 25:23.846
Yeah, so says
my business partner.

25:23.848 --> 25:26.849
- He's obviously a smart man.
- Haha!

25:26.851 --> 25:30.603
- Check it out.
- Yeah. Go time.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.792
- He stopped.
- Do you think he saw us?

25:52.794 --> 25:54.677
Looks like he's waiting
for someone.

25:54.679 --> 25:57.547
Check it out.

26:02.053 --> 26:03.269
Alright, buy me ten seconds.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.059
What a coincidence!

26:10.061 --> 26:12.562
All of us meeting
in the same street.

26:12.564 --> 26:14.447
Nothing to do with you.

26:14.449 --> 26:15.698
Don't!

26:17.202 --> 26:19.569
Hey, hey, hey!

26:19.571 --> 26:21.821
Hold still! Hey!

26:23.374 --> 26:25.491
Let her go!

26:25.493 --> 26:26.493
Her?!

26:28.613 --> 26:29.662
You're...

26:29.664 --> 26:32.665
May Chen...
Li Chen's granddaughter.

26:40.315 --> 26:42.515
'T her fault.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.567
Teetsa Jeung takes
years of training.

26:44.569 --> 26:48.071
- I saw it on the Internet, it was just a lucky shot.
- Why fighting with Donnie?

26:48.073 --> 26:50.406
We weren't fighting,
it was sparring.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.942
Wait, you're a student
at the school?!

26:52.944 --> 26:55.995
But Irving said...
May is a special student.

26:55.997 --> 26:58.248
Donnie was teaching
her privately.

27:01.569 --> 27:04.420
So, you made a deal with Donnie?

27:04.422 --> 27:06.172
It's not what you think.

27:06.174 --> 27:08.407
Donnie's a good kid,
he helps out in the community.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.793
He came to me
asking for a favour.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.463
In exchange for lessons?
What kind of favour?

27:13.465 --> 27:15.682
That's Donnie's business.

27:15.684 --> 27:17.517
And how do you factor into this?

27:17.519 --> 27:19.752
May came to me
'cause she was convinced

27:19.754 --> 27:21.971
that this was her fault.
She knew I was an expert.

27:21.973 --> 27:24.190
But I'm telling you,
there's no way she could have

27:24.192 --> 27:26.693
hit him hard enough to do this.

27:26.695 --> 27:30.863
- So how did it happen?
- Truthfully, I don't know.

27:33.451 --> 27:36.786
So May's handprint had nothing
to do with why he collapsed.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.988
And we're back in square one.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.230
We're still missing something.
Where else did Donnie go

27:41.254 --> 27:42.659
- that morning?
- Nowhere.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.627
There wasn't any time.

27:44.629 --> 27:46.913
The doctor said
that he had internal bleeding.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.915
I mean, if not from trauma,
then from what?

27:51.586 --> 27:54.087
The PT tests
on Donnie's blood show

27:54.089 --> 27:56.089
an abnormality in clotting.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.457
- What kind of abnormality?
- Well, normally,

27:58.459 --> 28:00.426
it takes blood
10 to 14 seconds to clot;

28:00.428 --> 28:02.645
In Donnie's case, it took 16

28:02.647 --> 28:05.064
implying he's deficient
in blood-clotting proteins.

28:05.066 --> 28:08.634
- Is he on blood thinners?
- Not that I know of.

28:08.636 --> 28:11.437
Donnie was really careful about
everything he put in his body.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.559
We screened for all
the common blood-thinning drugs,

28:13.583 --> 28:15.275
there was nothing there.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.277
I've ordered some more tests.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.162
Hopefully, we'll get
to the bottom of this soon.

28:21.316 --> 28:23.449
Thin blood would
explain the bruising,

28:23.451 --> 28:25.918
but not why
he ended up like this.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.838
If my grandma was here, she'd
make Donnie her special soup.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.541
She said it cured everything.
My grandma had the same thing.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.626
Except her special soup
was whiskey.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.628
- Mhm.
- Po po used willow bark.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.631
She'd buy it in big batches
from a Chinese herbalist.

28:38.633 --> 28:41.884
Tasted disgusting, but always
worked on my headaches.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.853
It makes sense.
Aspirin used to be made

28:43.855 --> 28:45.671
from willow bark.

28:45.673 --> 28:47.724
- That's it.
- Willow bark?

28:47.726 --> 28:51.944
- No, a herbalist.
- It's Danica. The police unlocked Donnie's phone.

28:51.946 --> 28:53.780
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Alright.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.294
So, it turns out
the folks in Forensics

29:08.296 --> 29:10.663
are actually super nice. You
just have to get them talking.

29:10.665 --> 29:12.665
So we started talking
about passwords because

29:12.667 --> 29:14.717
I've been using my birthday
for the past five years.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.719
But apparently,
that's really bad,

29:16.721 --> 29:19.505
so I think I'm gonna switch
to my mom's birthday, which...

29:19.507 --> 29:21.707
I probably shouldn't
have told you that.

29:21.709 --> 29:24.727
Already forgotten.
So, the phone?

29:24.729 --> 29:27.013
Yes!

29:27.015 --> 29:29.816
Aaah... OK.

29:29.818 --> 29:32.018
Alright. It's here.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.060
- Did you find anything?
- It's none of my business,

29:34.062 --> 29:35.895
but you may want
to check the text messages

29:35.897 --> 29:37.740
that Donnie gets
from a Michelle.

29:37.742 --> 29:39.659
Really, they do
a lot of meeting up.

29:39.661 --> 29:42.245
Good to know.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.946
Thanks.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.532
I gotta change my password.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.934
The nettle leaf and quercertin will stop
your cells from releasing any histamines.

29:52.674 --> 29:55.074
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

29:55.076 --> 29:58.761
I'm looking for something that
would act as a blood-thinning agent.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.163
Do you have a history of
cholesterol or high blood pressure?

30:01.187 --> 30:03.383
- Sure, let's go with that.
- I'll need something more

30:03.385 --> 30:05.435
to go on before
I prescribe something.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.388
There was an incident at the
Seventh Night Festival yesterday.

30:08.390 --> 30:11.474
A wing chun martial artist
collapsed during a demonstration.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.443
- Yes, I heard about that.
- The doctors

30:13.445 --> 30:16.229
can't figure out what's wrong with
him, and I was just wondering...

30:16.231 --> 30:18.591
If I knew of anything that
they might not be checking for?

30:18.615 --> 30:19.365
Exactly.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.767
In traditional Chinese
medicine, the wrong mix

30:21.769 --> 30:23.903
of ingredients can be
very dangerous.

30:23.905 --> 30:26.122
For example,
high doses of fish oil

30:26.124 --> 30:28.791
mixed with gingko biloba
could cause internal bleeding.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.294
So maybe somebody slipped
Donnie a dangerous mix

30:31.296 --> 30:33.463
- of herbs?
- Or...

30:33.465 --> 30:35.505
He hasn't been in contact
with any poisonous snakes,

30:35.529 --> 30:38.000
- has he?
- Interesting question.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.553
I'm gonna go with probably not.
It's a long shot,

30:40.555 --> 30:44.340
but some things you mentioned
could point to a haemotoxin.

30:44.342 --> 30:47.226
- You mean snake venom?
- Yeah.

30:47.228 --> 30:49.228
Excuse me.

30:51.599 --> 30:55.351
Snake venom? It's a
little obscure, don't you think?

30:55.353 --> 30:57.803
I think that's the point.
It wouldn't show up

30:57.805 --> 30:59.772
in any tox screens
and would fool the doctors

30:59.774 --> 31:02.742
into thinking Donnie was
on blood thinners. Why?

31:02.744 --> 31:05.361
Well, haemotoxins
cause blood clots,

31:05.363 --> 31:07.413
which means fewer platelets
in the bloodstream.

31:07.415 --> 31:09.332
Which would throw off
his test results.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.334
- Exactly.
- Question is

31:11.336 --> 31:15.121
where would Donnie come into
contact with snake venom? Yeah.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.757
It's not exactly something
you put in your morning coffee.

31:17.759 --> 31:20.793
Unless it is. Didn't Tracy say

31:20.795 --> 31:23.179
that Donnie comes by
for his tea every morning?

31:23.181 --> 31:25.965
You think Tracy's behind this?
What's her motive?

31:28.937 --> 31:31.270
Check out Donnie's
text messages. Apparently,

31:31.272 --> 31:33.556
he'd been meeting in secret
with a woman named Michelle.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.058
"Hope I'll still get to see you.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.311
Been trying to call.
Are you on your way?"

31:38.313 --> 31:40.062
Well, who is this woman?

31:40.064 --> 31:42.949
I don't know, but those
messages go back three weeks.

31:42.951 --> 31:46.235
No wonder Donnie changed
his password.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.287
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

31:48.289 --> 31:51.707
We need to pay an after-hours
visit to our client's shop.

31:57.081 --> 32:00.500
So, I intend to poison my lover,

32:00.502 --> 32:02.502
where do you hide it?

32:02.504 --> 32:04.537
Assuming she hasn't gotten
rid of it already.

32:04.539 --> 32:06.556
You may be on to something,
she is a smart girl.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.391
Yeah.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.849
Not smart enough
to cover her tracks.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.988
Happy Valentine's Day.

32:21.990 --> 32:24.991
Nothing says "I love you"
like an untraceable haemotoxin.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.709
It's snake venom.

32:34.711 --> 32:37.328
We found it in a teapot
in your shop.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.714
I don't know where
it came from, it's not mine!

32:39.716 --> 32:42.050
I don't even keep toxic
cleaning products in my shop,

32:42.052 --> 32:44.502
let alone snake venom!
You already admitted

32:44.504 --> 32:46.584
to having a big fight
with Donnie; What was it about?

32:48.258 --> 32:51.342
- Michelle?
- Who's Michelle?

32:51.344 --> 32:54.304
The woman Donnie's been trading texts
with, who he's been secretly seeing.

32:54.328 --> 32:56.347
I don't know
anything about that.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.966
Maybe you were suspicious of
all the secrets, wanted to end

32:58.968 --> 33:02.187
the relationship permanently?
What?! I... No, I need

33:02.189 --> 33:04.272
Donnie now more than ever!
And why is that?

33:06.660 --> 33:08.743
Because of this.

33:11.665 --> 33:15.533
- You're pregnant?
- Does Donnie know?

33:15.535 --> 33:17.752
I didn't know how to tell him.

33:19.923 --> 33:21.923
At the studio his entire life,

33:21.925 --> 33:23.958
but it doesn't pay the bills.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.094
Is that what the fight
was about?

33:26.096 --> 33:30.014
I broached the idea
of him asking for a raise.

33:30.016 --> 33:32.383
I mean, I love Irving,
but he's been paying Donnie

33:32.385 --> 33:34.602
the same salary for eight years.
I think he's holding

33:34.604 --> 33:36.671
Donnie back,
but Donnie's too nice

33:36.673 --> 33:39.140
to say anything about it.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.609
So you don't know who this is?

33:44.614 --> 33:47.782
But I know Donnie, and there's
no way he's having an affair.

33:50.620 --> 33:52.870
So if our mystery woman
isn't Donnie's girlfriend,

33:52.872 --> 33:56.241
then who is she? Let's find out.

34:00.196 --> 34:03.464
- Michelle?
- Hi! Who are you?

34:03.466 --> 34:05.717
We're "Donnie."

34:05.719 --> 34:07.585
I don't understand.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.371
We know about the texts you
sent him, the secret meet-ups.

34:10.373 --> 34:12.639
Are you his lawyers?
I thought he was

34:12.641 --> 34:14.592
- doing this alone.
- Doing what?

34:14.594 --> 34:16.543
If he doesn't transfer
the money by midnight,

34:16.545 --> 34:18.846
the deal is dead.
Whoa, whoa, slow down.

34:18.848 --> 34:20.848
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say you're not

34:20.850 --> 34:23.384
having an affair with Donnie.
An affair?!

34:23.386 --> 34:28.222
God, no! I'm Donnie's realtor.

34:28.224 --> 34:31.442
"Michelle Choi. Don't be coy,
go with Choi." It's clever.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.695
Was he buying or selling?

34:33.697 --> 34:36.114
I found him
the perfect property.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.235
And I thought he was over
the moon. 10000 square feet,

34:38.260 --> 34:41.235
room for multiple classes.
Hey, Donnie's buying

34:41.237 --> 34:43.621
his own martial arts studio?
Yes.

34:43.623 --> 34:47.342
He had the down payment and a
guarantor in place for financing.

34:47.344 --> 34:49.010
I thought it was a done deal.

34:49.012 --> 34:51.045
We're private investigators.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.214
Donnie's been in an accident.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.550
- My God!
- This guarantor,

34:55.552 --> 34:57.435
was it Irving Guzman?

34:57.437 --> 34:59.437
No, it was a woman.

34:59.439 --> 35:01.356
An older woman.

35:01.358 --> 35:04.525
Li something. I can look it up.

35:04.527 --> 35:09.197
So Li Chen was helping Donnie
buy a martial arts studio.

35:09.199 --> 35:11.432
Maybe Donnie decided
to take Tracy's advice

35:11.434 --> 35:13.618
and strike out on his own.
But what about Irving?

35:13.620 --> 35:15.660
They were just about to go
on a world tour together.

35:15.684 --> 35:18.373
Fifty cities. Unless...

35:18.375 --> 35:21.159
- Unless what?
- Li Chen

35:21.161 --> 35:23.081
confirmed that her and Donnie
had a special deal.

35:23.105 --> 35:26.581
He was giving lessons to May in exchange
for her acting as his guarantor.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.467
So those aren't

35:29.469 --> 35:31.419
repayment dates;
Those are lesson dates.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.838
Kind of hard to be
competing in Berlin

35:33.840 --> 35:35.890
when you're coaching in Toronto.

35:35.892 --> 35:38.343
If Donnie really was leaving
to open his own studio,

35:38.345 --> 35:41.429
Irving's studio would be
in a lot of trouble.

35:41.431 --> 35:44.098
I think someone just shot
to the top of our suspect list.

36:00.917 --> 36:03.201
How did you get in here?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.653
We used Donnie's key.
Hope that's all right.

36:05.655 --> 36:07.538
We just wanted
to share the good news.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.507
We found out
what happened to him.

36:11.761 --> 36:13.261
Cheers.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.934
We know how important
Donnie is to you.

36:19.936 --> 36:23.388
He's your golden ticket.
Without him, you'd never survive.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.857
Especially
after putting yourself

36:25.859 --> 36:27.775
so deep in debt

36:27.777 --> 36:30.311
with a massive,
multi-city world tour.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.280
Not to mention
your expansion plans.

36:32.282 --> 36:34.248
Spending investors' money

36:34.250 --> 36:36.784
to finance
five new studios in Canada,

36:36.786 --> 36:40.204
ten in the U.S...
What did you think

36:40.206 --> 36:42.457
they'd say when they found out
Donnie was pulling out?

36:44.961 --> 36:46.627
Where did you get these?

36:46.629 --> 36:49.247
Li Chen has a lot of pull
in this community.

36:49.249 --> 36:52.467
You found out Donnie
was opening his own studio.

36:52.469 --> 36:54.385
And Tracy convinced him
that he'd be

36:54.387 --> 36:56.871
better off without you.

36:56.873 --> 36:58.923
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37:02.178 --> 37:06.180
We found this
in Tracy's tea shop.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.233
Only, we don't know what it is.

37:09.235 --> 37:12.403
If you found it in Tracy's shop,
why aren't you questioning her?

37:12.405 --> 37:16.274
We did. She didn't know
what it was either.

37:16.276 --> 37:18.326
So, we put some of it

37:18.328 --> 37:20.244
in your tea.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.031
See, we realized
Tracy didn't make.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.200
Donnie's tea that morning.
You did.

37:29.122 --> 37:31.255
How are you feeling?

37:35.628 --> 37:37.929
I put...

37:37.931 --> 37:40.047
everything into Donnie's career.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.467
This tour was gonna
change everything.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.723
Chi Sao would have been

37:48.725 --> 37:52.276
the biggest studio
in North America.

37:54.814 --> 37:57.732
Not his.

37:59.869 --> 38:03.321
Irving Guzman,
you're under arrest.

38:05.708 --> 38:08.075
You guys didn't really
poison the tea,

38:08.077 --> 38:09.460
did you?

38:09.462 --> 38:11.746
OK, yeah, let's go.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.144
Aaah... There he is,

38:26.146 --> 38:28.096
hopping around.

38:28.098 --> 38:30.815
Tracy was telling me
in excruciating detail

38:30.817 --> 38:33.151
about how the two of you
saved my life.

38:33.153 --> 38:35.904
- She is exaggerating.
- So how are you feeling?

38:35.906 --> 38:38.490
Physically, like crap.

38:38.492 --> 38:40.775
Mentally,

38:40.777 --> 38:42.744
even worse now that I know
who's behind it.

38:42.746 --> 38:45.447
You could never have suspected
Irving would try to hurt you.

38:45.449 --> 38:47.866
No, but I should have realized

38:47.868 --> 38:49.868
that he was taking advantage
of me a long time ago.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.836
And now I have nothing.

38:51.838 --> 38:55.257
Actually, we spoke
with Michelle Choi.

38:55.259 --> 38:57.592
She convinced the seller
to extend the deadline

38:57.594 --> 39:01.046
on the studio space.
Are you serious?

39:01.048 --> 39:04.382
It's still yours if you want it.

39:04.384 --> 39:07.636
- Your own studio!
- Well, it's ours.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.972
If you'll still have me.

39:10.974 --> 39:14.142
Listen, Tracy,
I wanna talk about our fight. It's OK.

39:14.144 --> 39:16.444
No. It was... It's my fault.

39:16.446 --> 39:18.780
I was the one keeping
secrets from you,

39:18.782 --> 39:20.532
I just wanted it
to be a surprise.

39:22.002 --> 39:24.119
You weren't the only one
keeping a secret.

39:55.519 --> 39:57.769
That's alright.
We were happy to help.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.605
Besides, it all worked out in the
end and you're gonna be an auntie.

40:03.243 --> 40:05.277
Congratulations, Zoe.

40:05.279 --> 40:08.863
How's the trip going by the way?

40:12.753 --> 40:15.587
Wow! You're brave!

40:17.591 --> 40:19.831
They tried to get me to
eat that when I was down there,

40:19.855 --> 40:23.357
and I said, "No way,
I'm not eating guinea..." Shhh!

40:25.265 --> 40:27.515
"Pig."

40:33.140 --> 40:36.308
I figured, if she says
no to me in my boxer shorts,

40:36.310 --> 40:38.276
then it's not meant to be.

40:38.278 --> 40:40.612
And what did Becca say?

40:40.614 --> 40:42.530
She said, "No."

40:46.153 --> 40:48.570
and re-propose
under the Eiffel Tower.

40:48.572 --> 40:50.853
OK. Well, that probably
should have been your first sign

40:50.855 --> 40:52.615
it wasn't gonna work out.
Should have been.

40:52.639 --> 40:54.125
My God!

40:54.127 --> 40:56.411
Truth is I was

40:56.413 --> 40:58.463
so in love with her
at that time,

40:58.465 --> 41:00.832
I was the definition
of a fool in love.

41:00.834 --> 41:04.035
I don't know.
Everyone puts so much emphasis

41:04.037 --> 41:06.037
on the perfect engagement,

41:06.039 --> 41:08.306
but I don't know if it exists.

41:08.308 --> 41:11.393
Ken proposed to me twice,
and both times were

41:11.395 --> 41:13.544
absolutely perfect.

41:13.546 --> 41:15.563
It's just him

41:15.565 --> 41:17.682
I didn't want.
So what do you want,

41:17.684 --> 41:20.101
Ms. Everett?

41:22.105 --> 41:24.105
Sounds crazy,

41:24.107 --> 41:27.058
but I just want someone
unpredictable, you know.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.993
Someone who calls me on my crap,

41:28.995 --> 41:30.995
someone who...

41:30.997 --> 41:33.331
someone who drives me nuts,

41:33.333 --> 41:38.336
but in the end,
always has my back.

41:38.338 --> 41:40.672
Wow, that does sound crazy.

41:40.674 --> 41:43.625
Shut up.

41:43.627 --> 41:46.094
Seriously, that sounds
very mature.

41:48.932 --> 41:52.767
And you need to know
whoever you do end up with,

41:52.769 --> 41:54.853
he's one lucky guy.

41:54.855 --> 41:59.140
Damn, Shade. I didn't
expect you to say that.

42:09.286 --> 42:12.237
Ha!

42:12.239 --> 42:14.439
Yes! Hahaha!

42:14.441 --> 42:16.408
Triumph!

42:16.410 --> 42:18.626
Congratulations, Dad!

42:18.628 --> 42:20.962
Yeah. Bravo,
compliments to the chef.

42:20.964 --> 42:24.582
Haha! I kicked butt. Hahaha!

42:24.584 --> 42:27.001
Hey, I got enough in the car
for three more small bowls

42:27.003 --> 42:30.004
of this prize-winning gumbo.
Why don't you go

42:30.006 --> 42:32.046
get that and I'll get
some bowls out of the kitchen.

42:32.070 --> 42:34.259
Alright.

42:34.261 --> 42:37.095
That's, that's
the contractor and the agency's

42:37.097 --> 42:39.731
all good, so I'm gonna go.
You're welcome to stay here.

42:39.733 --> 42:42.100
No, it's fine. I've got
a lot of work to catch up on.

42:44.154 --> 42:47.572
Prize-winning gumbo...
you heard, right?

42:47.574 --> 42:49.574
Yes, and I will take
a giant rain cheque on that.

42:49.598 --> 42:51.526
Thank you, Don.
Shade, I'll see you

42:51.528 --> 42:53.695
tomorrow or... whatever.

42:53.697 --> 42:57.081
- Yeah.
- Alrighty then.

42:57.083 --> 43:00.168
I guess it's just us guys.

43:00.170 --> 43:04.005
What were you two up to?
Nothing. Just work stuff.
