00:03.378 --> 00:06.422
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- Oh, I'll have some.

00:06.589 --> 00:09.758
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.760
Ow.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.430
- Oh, what's the matter, honey?
- My hand feels weird.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.557
I guess it's because I'm engaged.

00:18.435 --> 00:21.020
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

00:22.605 --> 00:24.606
So let's actually get started
on the wedding plans.

00:24.774 --> 00:25.941
- Okay.
- Already?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.777
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We gotta think about the flowers...

00:28.945 --> 00:30.362
...the caterers, the music...

00:30.530 --> 00:33.407
- Oh, I got some thoughts on the music...
- Chandler, too many cooks...

00:35.285 --> 00:39.413
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.709
Okay.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.171
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

00:47.422 --> 00:49.798
I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.

00:50.133 --> 00:55.137
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations for instance:

00:55.346 --> 00:59.099
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

00:59.309 --> 01:01.643
...then by square footage.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.606
That is so smart. Ha.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.275
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.901
And that should conclusively prove...

01:51.194 --> 01:54.905
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.032
- Now, let's take a look...
- Hey, Ross.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.451
Phoebe, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

01:59.619 --> 02:03.122
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.541
Oh, my God. Um, of course.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.335
Uh, would you please excuse me
for a moment?

02:08.502 --> 02:12.589
Um, heh, do you know each other's
hometowns? Why don't you?

02:13.508 --> 02:14.925
What's going on?

02:15.135 --> 02:19.721
Well, um, not much. I was just thinking
that since those guys just got engaged...

02:20.014 --> 02:22.224
...that maybe it'd be nice
if they had some privacy.

02:22.433 --> 02:26.103
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

02:27.564 --> 02:28.897
Um...

02:29.065 --> 02:32.734
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

02:32.944 --> 02:35.154
Nothing. Why?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.907
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.286
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies
and it starts in like five minutes.

02:45.415 --> 02:49.626
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

02:51.421 --> 02:55.591
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.930
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents yet...

03:02.098 --> 03:03.724
...but tell me how this is for music.

03:03.892 --> 03:08.103
All right, um, a string quartet for the
processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...

03:08.313 --> 03:10.606
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

03:10.857 --> 03:12.733
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

03:14.235 --> 03:18.572
Well, you couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.993
Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

03:23.786 --> 03:27.873
Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow,
you know, something a little snugglier?

03:28.124 --> 03:31.293
Why are you napping over here
instead of over at your place?

03:31.461 --> 03:33.587
- The duck.
- What, the duck?

03:33.796 --> 03:36.131
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

03:37.091 --> 03:41.470
Uh, well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

03:41.721 --> 03:44.973
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.893
Now, do I get to look at this book...

03:48.061 --> 03:51.355
...or is it just for people who are actually
involved in the wedding?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.816
Of course you can look at it.
Yeah, I want your opinion too.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.652
- Okay.
- Here you go.

03:56.861 --> 03:59.404
- What do you think about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.658
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

04:06.996 --> 04:10.332
Well, I just think they're a bit more
wedding-y, you know.

04:12.168 --> 04:16.004
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.673
Uh-huh.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.927
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.680
I'm gonna get cranky.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.059
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.561
Yes, it is perfectly good...

04:31.854 --> 04:35.274
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.359
What?

04:38.069 --> 04:41.863
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

04:42.156 --> 04:45.075
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.921
Hey, little buddy.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.258
How you feeling? Aah.

05:03.428 --> 05:06.179
What the hell is in that face cream?

05:19.777 --> 05:21.987
That's so soft.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.783
Pillowcases.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.913
Oh, ah.

05:41.591 --> 05:46.303
"Zelda looked at the chimney
sweep. Her father, the vicar..."

05:46.596 --> 05:47.846
Vicar?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.433
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.602
Her loins were burning.

05:53.811 --> 05:58.023
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

05:58.191 --> 06:02.944
Whoa.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.781
This is a dirty book.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.463
Uh, Phoebe?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.298
Oh, Ross, hi.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.805
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.267
- Phoebe.
- Okay, let's talk outside.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.480
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.191
What's the big deal?
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.068
And they knew about it?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.408
Okay, look, Ross,
what is this really about?

06:50.034 --> 06:53.870
Look, this is my home, and I want to
be able to come and go whenever I want.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.499
Okay. I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.501
I just don't know what the big deal is.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.671
The big deal is I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

07:02.880 --> 07:07.175
...when I want to kick back with a puzzle...
Beer, cold beer.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.055
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

07:12.432 --> 07:16.309
Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?

07:18.521 --> 07:19.688
No.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.690
Hmm.

07:22.066 --> 07:25.068
What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?

07:27.238 --> 07:29.322
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

07:32.618 --> 07:35.454
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.878
Joey...

07:43.921 --> 07:45.380
...where did you learn that word?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.718
Where do you think...

07:50.386 --> 07:51.386
...Zelda?

07:54.348 --> 07:57.601
- You found my book?
- Yeah, I did.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.605
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

08:01.856 --> 08:03.732
Okay, I'm sorry.
I went in there to take a nap.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.734
And I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.444
Ugh.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.906
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

08:11.115 --> 08:15.952
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

08:16.245 --> 08:20.081
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

08:20.291 --> 08:24.294
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

08:26.797 --> 08:28.465
You got porn.

08:50.196 --> 08:54.115
- Hello.
- Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?

08:54.325 --> 08:58.286
- Uh, no, no, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.456
Heh. Can I help you with something?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.667
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

09:04.418 --> 09:05.794
Yes, I am.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.173
Great. Dad?

09:15.721 --> 09:19.140
Thank you so much.
I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.066
So, Chandler, your parents
must've been thrilled...

09:28.234 --> 09:29.734
...when you told them
you were engaged.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.195
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.490
I remember when we first got engaged.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.867
- I don't think I've heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

09:38.077 --> 09:40.328
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.999
I still don't know how.

09:44.166 --> 09:48.503
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.258
What a sweet story.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.220
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.097
What? They wanted a scary story.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.101
Anyway, we're really excited
about our wedding plans.

10:03.352 --> 10:06.980
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.904
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.699
What happened?
You still have the wedding fund, don't you?

10:17.867 --> 10:21.119
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house."

10:25.207 --> 10:28.168
I can't believe you spent my wedding fund
on the beach house.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.711
We're sorry. We assumed...

10:29.879 --> 10:32.839
...if you got married after you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.675
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

10:35.843 --> 10:38.178
Which means you had seven years
of beach fun...

10:38.346 --> 10:40.430
...and you can't put a price on that,
sweetie.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.934
We really do feel bad about this though.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.228
We started saving again
when you dated Richard.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.898
But then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.277
What about when I started
dating Chandler?

10:54.445 --> 10:56.780
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd ever propose.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.577
Clearly I did not start drinking enough
at the start of the meal. Heh.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.871
I can't believe there is no money
for my wedding.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.083
We might still have some
if your father hadn't thought...

11:08.250 --> 11:10.085
...to sell ice over the Internet.

11:10.294 --> 11:13.963
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

11:14.256 --> 11:17.425
All right, enough.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.094
Good luck, Chandler.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.622
Okay, now I'm going to...

11:48.624 --> 11:50.542
...touch you.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.178
Oh, that's soft.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.999
I can't believe this. Do you think
your parents could help pay for it?

12:31.208 --> 12:32.333
I don't know.

12:32.501 --> 12:36.671
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.215
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

12:39.508 --> 12:44.220
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to...

12:45.014 --> 12:46.347
...Dollywood.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.934
What happened at dinner?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.228
My parents spent the money
for our wedding.

12:53.647 --> 12:55.607
My God, what did you order?

12:57.026 --> 13:01.738
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

13:01.989 --> 13:05.492
You guys are gonna have to get married
in, like, a rec center.

13:06.702 --> 13:10.663
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.

13:10.831 --> 13:14.709
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.712
I mean, you don't need to have this...

13:17.922 --> 13:20.799
...rustic Italian feast, you know?

13:21.050 --> 13:27.514
And you don't need this custom-made
empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.432
You can wear off-the-rack.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.439
Look, it really is gonna be okay.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.819
The important thing is that we love
each other and we're gonna get married.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.739
Do you even understand
what "off-the-rack" means?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.576
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?

13:48.786 --> 13:50.286
How? I don't have any money.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.539
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

13:52.748 --> 13:53.790
Well, close to...

14:05.803 --> 14:08.638
- Whoa! Are you kidding me?
- What? How much?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.766
- It's enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.853
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.939
The amount you have is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.067
Oh, you guys
are so made for each other.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.446
Well, you're not suggesting we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

14:25.614 --> 14:27.448
Uh, yeah.

14:28.951 --> 14:32.662
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

14:32.872 --> 14:37.125
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

14:37.334 --> 14:41.337
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.

14:43.799 --> 14:47.302
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

14:47.469 --> 14:51.389
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.058
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.520
But, um, if you call our wedding a party
one more time...

14:57.813 --> 14:59.355
...you may not get invited.

15:02.109 --> 15:06.112
We can always earn more money, okay?
But we're only gonna get married once.

15:06.322 --> 15:10.742
Look, I understand, but I have to put
my foot down, okay? The answer is no.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.162
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

15:14.371 --> 15:16.664
Yes, I am.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.836
Wow. Money and a firm hand.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.672
Finally a Chandler
I can get on board with.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.683
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.188
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

15:40.356 --> 15:44.651
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.780
No, no, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

15:49.573 --> 15:50.698
Something's on fire.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.867
No, I don't smell anything.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.788
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.

16:01.543 --> 16:04.545
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.051
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.470
Hey, Rach, do you mind
if I heat this up on your loins?

16:16.475 --> 16:20.269
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

16:20.688 --> 16:23.898
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up, huh?

16:24.108 --> 16:27.735
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.238
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

16:30.406 --> 16:34.701
Well, uh, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.953
'Sup?

16:38.414 --> 16:42.417
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.754
Excuse me, ladies.

16:47.756 --> 16:49.257
I'm sorry?

16:49.466 --> 16:51.843
My massage client, Arthur.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.762
His daughter called and said
some guy that worked for me...

16:54.930 --> 16:57.098
...gave him a really weird massage
this afternoon.

16:57.307 --> 17:00.226
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.813
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.773
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.111
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

17:10.319 --> 17:14.531
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

17:16.785 --> 17:20.538
Well, he's never coming back, okay?
You just cost me $80 a week.

17:20.789 --> 17:24.000
You know what? This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.252
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.755
You could've sent him away.

17:28.922 --> 17:31.674
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.970
He said he liked that.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.392
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

17:41.769 --> 17:44.979
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

17:47.149 --> 17:49.525
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.993
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.287
Listen, um...

18:02.706 --> 18:04.165
...I've been thinking.

18:04.333 --> 18:09.337
And it's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all your money on our wedding.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.507
I mean, you work really hard for that.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.926
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.596
Look, I thought about it too.

18:18.764 --> 18:24.352
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

18:25.354 --> 18:29.190
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.986
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...

18:34.154 --> 18:37.365
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.952
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

18:41.203 --> 18:43.329
...then that's what we're gonna do.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.124
You are so sweet.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.086
Oh, but wait.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.214
What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.716
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.343
So we only have two kids.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.389
You know, we'll pick our favorite
and that one will get to go to college.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.059
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.936
How many kids were we gonna have?

19:07.104 --> 19:10.857
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.652
What else did you think about?

19:14.820 --> 19:17.655
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.575
Like a small place outside the city...

19:20.742 --> 19:23.995
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes and stuff.

19:24.246 --> 19:27.081
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

19:27.374 --> 19:31.878
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.132
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.889
You know what?

19:44.099 --> 19:46.767
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.312
- Sure you do.
- No.

19:50.898 --> 19:55.610
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.113
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.118
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.127
Hey, listen, when you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.838
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.635
- Ha, yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

20:32.356 --> 20:34.065
Hello, Zelda.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.278
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.116
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

20:44.701 --> 20:45.743
Yeah.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.870
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?

20:48.121 --> 20:51.123
You keep making these stupid jokes
and these sleazy innuendoes...

20:51.333 --> 20:53.209
...and it's just not funny anymore.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.712
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

20:56.922 --> 21:01.217
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.885
Ugh.

21:03.845 --> 21:07.265
All right, you know what? That's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.392
Huh?

21:09.559 --> 21:12.186
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

21:13.981 --> 21:18.651
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.278
Uh, I did?

21:20.445 --> 21:23.698
Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.159
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.453
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

21:29.663 --> 21:33.332
Hey, you're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.

21:33.834 --> 21:37.837
Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.

21:38.046 --> 21:42.300
But I would keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.303
I don't want to. I'm scared.
