00:06.840 --> 00:09.375
The '60s, man.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.277
Influential musicians
like bob dylan

00:12.279 --> 00:14.213
And joan baez...

00:14.215 --> 00:16.849
Playing guitars
and singing like prophets.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.184
The times,
they were a-changin'.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.285
( dull thud )

00:21.388 --> 00:23.555
The class,
they are a-sleepin'.

00:25.225 --> 00:26.525
It's not your fault, dad.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.361
It's just the stuff
you're saying.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.531
I'm talking about
the '60s, man.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.570
Nobody cares about
when you were our age.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.241
Riley, it was
over 50 years ago.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.976
How old do you guys
think I am?

00:43.978 --> 00:46.545
There's no right answer
to this, sir.

00:47.914 --> 00:49.982
You should teach us
future class,

00:49.984 --> 00:53.852
Listen, dad, you're doing
a wonderful job up there

00:53.854 --> 00:55.954
And we're very happy
that you're all jazzed up...

00:55.956 --> 00:58.524
But history has
nothing to do with us.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.692
I'm gonna snap
this chalk now.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.361
- Uh-oh.
- Snap.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.265
What did you guys
do yesterday?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.767
I think
I had grapes.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.436
Do you know
what yesterday was?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.704
Grapes day.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.573
It's history.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.009
Every decision
you make every day,

01:17.011 --> 01:19.945
Every time you decide
to turn left instead of right,

01:19.947 --> 01:21.580
You make history

01:21.582 --> 01:23.348
And you affect
someone else's.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.984
And if you refuse to learn that,
I guarantee you,

01:25.986 --> 01:28.854
You guys will not become
the best person you can be.

01:28.856 --> 01:32.724
Because history is all about
missed opportunities.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.394
"history has nothing
to do with us,"
wasn't it, ms. Hart?

01:35.396 --> 01:38.397
Can't remember, it was
like five minutes ago.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.766
Fine.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.802
I am not gonna teach
you guys about the '60s.

01:43.804 --> 01:44.870
All: Yay.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.572
You are.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.474
- ( kids groan )
- ( flatly ) yay.

01:48.476 --> 01:51.276
History is alive
even if you weren't.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.678
But now you're gonna be.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.646
You will visit the 1960s

01:54.648 --> 01:55.914
And give a report.

01:55.916 --> 01:59.051
Time travel.

01:59.053 --> 02:01.120
How do we do that, dad?
We weren't there.

02:02.055 --> 02:03.956
- You were.
- How?

02:03.958 --> 02:07.292
You all have grandparents
or great-grandparents.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.428
Choose one who was
around during that time.

02:09.430 --> 02:12.764
Learn all you can about them
and report back.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.601
Then we'll see if history
has nothing to do with us.

02:15.603 --> 02:18.437
Living history...

02:18.439 --> 02:19.638
Now I'm all jazzed up.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.707
- ( kids groan )
- ( flatly ) yay.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.978
( jazz music
playing )

02:30.083 --> 02:32.351
( music continues )

02:38.558 --> 02:40.692
You're a new face.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.327
So are you,

02:42.329 --> 02:44.429
But everything's
new to me--

02:44.431 --> 02:46.965
The people, the places,

02:46.967 --> 02:50.802
The whole
happening scene, man.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.604
First time you ever
said that, isn't it?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.007
I practiced
the whole way here.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.342
Let me get a vibe.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.919
I dig you
immedia-tois.

03:06.921 --> 03:08.587
What does that mean?

03:08.589 --> 03:11.123
I don't know.
I made it up.

03:12.659 --> 03:16.094
Well, here's what I want
you to make up for me:

03:16.096 --> 03:19.131
A hot chocolate
with extra whipped cream,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.733
Because I'm dangerous.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.869
You got a name,
dangerous?

03:24.837 --> 03:27.105
Rosie.
Rosie mcgee.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.508
- What's yours?
- Ginsburg.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.776
Nice to meet you, rosie.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.880
What's the picture for?

03:34.882 --> 03:37.082
For the moment
we first met.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.717
I'll get
your hot chocolate, mcgee.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.786
I know this is weird,

03:40.788 --> 03:43.455
But have we met before?

03:43.457 --> 03:45.791
Haven't we all?

Pronounced, "hehhh."

04:47.154 --> 04:49.021
All: Hehhh.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.056
You're getting
better at that.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.991
Tonight's gonna be
legendary, man.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.127
Let's just see
what flows.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.561
- ( snaps )
- ( bass tone )

04:59.732 --> 05:01.733
Black.

White.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.870
Green.  Tan.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.873
No one listen
to the man.

05:07.875 --> 05:11.109
Freedom is
the only plan.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.012
Free to be
who you am.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.681
Can't you see?

05:15.683 --> 05:19.184
That you... Are... Me.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.954
Karma.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.023
( snapping )

05:29.128 --> 05:30.495
Whatcha writing?

05:30.497 --> 05:33.532
Oh!  Just... Observations.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.834
You know, thoughts
about the people I meet.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.036
These are deep, man.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.905
You're one deep chick.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.206
Chick?

05:41.208 --> 05:43.275
Down here
I'm a chick.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.844
( sighs )

05:47.146 --> 05:48.847
( sighs )

05:48.849 --> 05:50.816
Why'd you come here
tonight, rosie?

05:50.818 --> 05:53.752
I came to make
some new friends.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.055
You see, there's
two tables over there:

05:57.057 --> 05:59.958
The one the left,
bob and joan;

05:59.960 --> 06:01.860
Table on the right,
a blonde girl

06:01.862 --> 06:04.096
All alone.
She's new around here, too.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.531
Go left or right.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.133
What to do?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.668
Karma.

06:25.985 --> 06:28.987
You are really
interesting looking.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.922
Are you as interesting
as you look?

06:30.924 --> 06:34.126
Sure, are you as weird
as you talk?

06:34.128 --> 06:36.895
Oh my gosh.
Yeah, man.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.765
I am the weirdest cat
there is.

06:39.767 --> 06:43.068
Really?  'cause you seem
like a nice, normal girl to me.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.704
You figured
me out in five seconds
and you've hurt me.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.140
How can I make
that up to you?

06:48.142 --> 06:49.975
Could we be friends?

06:49.977 --> 06:52.277
I would be
a very good friend to you.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.181
Yeah, I could use
a weird friend.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.350
Then you should pick...

07:00.153 --> 07:03.054
Oh, they both
landed on me.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.130
All right,
status report.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.366
I got a guitar that belonged
to my great-grandmother rosie,

07:14.368 --> 07:17.335
And her very weird journal.

07:17.337 --> 07:20.005
My dad is sending something
about my great-grandfather.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.273
We don't talk
about him much.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.307
His name was merlin.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.009
Merlin?
Was he a wizard?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.143
Hah!

07:26.345 --> 07:28.046
Okay, farkle minkus.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.681
What was your
great-grandfather's name?

07:29.683 --> 07:31.983
Ginsburg.

07:31.985 --> 07:34.986
You make no sense
to me whatsoever.

07:36.756 --> 07:37.856
Whatcha looking at?

07:37.858 --> 07:40.025
Art book.
Ms. Kossal gave it to me.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.028
It's got all the best artists
and their best paintings.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.030
It's amazing...
And depressing.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.164
She's trying
to motivate you.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.266
Ain't working.
Look at these.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.901
I could never do
anything near this.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.337
These people all have
something to say.

07:52.339 --> 07:56.007
Well, you only know
that because they went
ahead and said it.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.009
You know, someday you're
gonna make somebody

07:58.011 --> 07:59.778
A wonderful
fortune cookie.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.781
Let me take a picture
of everybody.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.116
- What for?
- ( phone camera clicks )

08:05.118 --> 08:07.052
I don't know.
It's us.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.054
We may be important
to somebody someday.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.756
You guys are
already important to me.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.858
How?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.960
You teach me
how to be friends.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.028
All: Aww...

08:28.007 --> 08:30.108
Maya, aren't you
bringing that?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.143
What, this book of...

08:32.145 --> 08:34.813
"why bother trying I'll never
be as good as these guys"?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.948
That's a very
discouraging title.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.051
I love you, riley,
but I'm leaving this here.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.786
It makes me feel bad and...

08:41.788 --> 08:43.154
It's really heavy.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.396
You're making me
feel bad.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.998
There's some pretty heavy
stuff in here.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.134
"the girl with
the long, blonde hair."

08:56.136 --> 08:58.136
Who's that about,
I wonder.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.139
( sighs )
it's my first time here

09:01.141 --> 09:03.308
And I would like
to remember everything.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.243
Maybe I'll write
about it later.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.712
It's my first time
here, too.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.748
I'm on my way
to california.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.917
My bus broke down,
bad luck.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.085
I don't understand
why these things happen.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.022
Because if you're bus
doesn't break down,

09:17.024 --> 09:18.890
Then we don't
become friends.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.026
If I go sit at that table
instead of this table,

09:21.028 --> 09:23.128
Then I'm not
friends with...

09:23.130 --> 09:25.096
May clutterbucket.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.298
Yow.

09:27.733 --> 09:30.368
What's in california
for you, may?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.103
I'm going to say
clutterbucket now.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.505
But just so you know,
when I say it

09:33.507 --> 09:35.473
I am not making
fun of you.

09:37.176 --> 09:39.978
Well, there's a place
where people are making art

09:39.980 --> 09:41.012
And playing music.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.081
Sounds cool.
Where is it?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.984
It's a place called
topanga canyon.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.452
I'm sure I'll love it.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.321
Topanga...

09:49.323 --> 09:53.024
What a beautiful name
for something that you
want to love.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.960
I'm gonna remember that.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.028
May, take the stage, may.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.129
You're up.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.966
( applause )

10:00.968 --> 10:02.300
What's your name,
new friend?

10:02.302 --> 10:03.468
Rosie mcgee.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.303
Wish me luck,
rosie mcgee.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.174
Wow, you're going
to sing?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.542
I'm going to try.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.078
Yay, go get 'em!

10:13.080 --> 10:16.414
And remember,
you're beautiful, man.

11:26.219 --> 11:29.187
Let's hear it
for may clutterbucket.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.323
( scoffs )
what are you
laughing at, bob dylan?

11:34.060 --> 11:36.061
Merlin.
Merlin scoggins.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.595
Take the stage,
cowboy.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.067
Who the heck
is that?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.568
So that's him.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.170
I've heard
about him.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.473
( country music playing )

11:53.112 --> 11:54.212
Hello.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.316
I'm merlin scoggins.

12:01.353 --> 12:03.088
Hello.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.656
I'm lucas friar.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.124
My great-grandpa
used to do that.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.626
He was a man
named merlin scoggins.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.029
And this record
was a big hit.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.164
That's amazing, lucas.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.566
Why didn't you ever
tell us any of that?

12:14.568 --> 12:16.568
Yeah,
I'm gonna tell maya

12:16.570 --> 12:18.269
I have a country-singing
great-grandpa

12:18.271 --> 12:20.238
And that I actually do
come from cowboys.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.607
Yeah, because I need
more nicknames to go with

12:22.609 --> 12:26.344
Hopalong, sundance
and ranger rick.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.114
No, I'm done with that.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.484
I am so impressed
with your rich,
texas heritage

12:32.486 --> 12:34.052
That I am officially
throwing out

12:34.054 --> 12:36.221
All of those
old nicknames forever.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.123
Wow, thank you, maya.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.092
No problem,
bucky mcboing boing.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.562
From what I can
piece together,

12:44.564 --> 12:46.197
My great-grandmother
rosie mcgee

12:46.199 --> 12:48.333
Was a weird, little,
wide-eyed goofball

12:48.335 --> 12:50.435
Who only saw the best
in everybody.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.237
Who's like that?

12:52.239 --> 12:54.072
Nobody.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.275
I'd like to play you
my great-grandfather's song.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.049
Yeah, you're not
a normal girl at all.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.051
I liked your song, ma'am.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.020
I liked yours.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.421
And what do you do?

13:43.423 --> 13:46.224
Ah, who knows?

13:46.226 --> 13:49.060
She's an observer
of humanity.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.230
Well, we need those.

13:53.432 --> 13:57.135
The observer, the singer,
and the mystery man.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.139
That's gotta be
worth something

14:01.141 --> 14:02.507
To somebody someday.

14:04.143 --> 14:06.277
Well, thank you all
for your kind words

14:06.279 --> 14:08.213
And I'll be
on my way.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.583
Oh, do you have
to go?

14:13.085 --> 14:15.320
I try not to stay
any place too long...

14:15.322 --> 14:17.622
Especially when people
do that.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.160
Stay here
with this one too long

14:22.162 --> 14:24.295
And she might change us
for the better.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.599
Aww...

14:27.601 --> 14:30.301
( chuckles )
yeah, anyway...

14:30.303 --> 14:32.670
You keep writing down
those observations.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.138
And you,

14:34.140 --> 14:35.273
You keep playing.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.343
What, my new song,

14:38.345 --> 14:41.279
"why bother trying, I'll never
be as good as you guys"?

14:41.281 --> 14:43.648
That's a very
discouraging title.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.451
You have
something to say.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.086
Well, now,
you only know that,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.154
Because I went ahead
and said it.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.367
Here.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.302
Why are you giving
me this?

15:04.304 --> 15:05.703
You were great.

15:05.705 --> 15:10.308
No, he's going
to change the world.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.843
I'm not gonna
change a thing.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.216
Where are you going?

15:18.218 --> 15:20.418
Don't you worry, weirdo.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.719
I'll be right back.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.777
My great-grandmother
never saw her friend again.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.179
The world has never heard
of may clutterbucket.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.183
My great-grandfather
had one huge hit.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.718
People thought he was
gonna change the world,

15:53.720 --> 15:55.320
But... He didn't.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.455
After an appearance
in a small cafe

15:57.457 --> 16:00.291
In new york city,
he made some bad choices.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.293
He went to jail
for a little while.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.163
He went left
instead of right.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.831
And why do you think
that was, mr. Friar?

16:06.833 --> 16:09.534
Don't know.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.169
Maybe he needed
some better friends.

16:13.205 --> 16:15.139
Rosie liked
observing things.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.709
I'm going to read something
from her journal.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.445
It's called
"the girl with the long,
blonde hair."

16:21.914 --> 16:24.248
"she said she would be
gone for a moment,

16:24.250 --> 16:25.750
I am still waiting.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.218
We could have
been friends,

16:27.220 --> 16:28.853
Maybe in some other life.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.922
The girl with
the long, blonde hair."

16:30.924 --> 16:33.291
It sounds like rosie
was a pretty good writer.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.159
There's a little bit more.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.895
"if you quiet your voice,
if you stop,

16:37.897 --> 16:40.164
Because you think
other people are better,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.166
Then you are not
who I know you are,

16:42.168 --> 16:43.901
The girl with
the long, blonde hair."

16:43.903 --> 16:45.403
You wrote that.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.438
I continued it.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.674
I am a continuation.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.943
That's what history's about,
right, dad?

16:51.945 --> 16:55.179
( chuckles )
oh, now I get it.

16:56.482 --> 16:59.717
Rosie had a daughter,
and her daughter had my mom.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.854
Rosie gave me my mom
and she gave my dad his wife.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.792
This has been in our family
for over 50 years.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.695
But I feel like
it belongs with you.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.232
So I hope that
whenever you see it,

17:14.234 --> 17:17.402
It will remind you
that even though rosie's
friend gave up,

17:17.404 --> 17:18.503
You never should.

What year did your

visit new york?

19:30.937 --> 19:32.904
Both: 1961.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.840
Whoa.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.942
I knew it.
What month?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.111
- Both: December.
- Say it again.

19:40.113 --> 19:41.913
Both: Whoa.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.615

the name of the club?

You went behind her back

didn't you?

19:58.898 --> 19:59.931
No.

19:59.933 --> 20:00.998

No.  They never
became friends.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.063
She walked out.
She left.
