00:01.792 --> 00:04.500
[woman] A couple of good things
about being in a coma:

00:04.500 --> 00:07.709
No fattening food,
lots of rest,

00:07.709 --> 00:09.458
they sponge you down every day.

00:09.458 --> 00:11.583
It's like a spa.

00:11.583 --> 00:13.750
Bad things: my nose itches,

00:13.750 --> 00:16.875
I have something called
The Piña Colada Song stuck
in my head,

00:16.875 --> 00:20.500
and, oh, yeah, sometimes I can
hear what people in my room
are saying.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.500
I don't care if no one liked
her. She's still my daughter.

00:23.500 --> 00:26.291
Struck down
by a hit-and-run driver.

00:26.291 --> 00:30.792
Hooked to machines like an
eighth-grade science experiment.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.709
A coma from which
she may never awake.

00:33.709 --> 00:38.041
Where does a mother turn for
comfort and answers at a time
like this?

00:38.041 --> 00:39.417
To you, that's where.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.792
The good people at
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.

00:43.625 --> 00:46.208
Oh, my Lord. Howard,
she's awake! Call the doctor.

00:46.208 --> 00:49.375
Sweetheart, close your eyes.
I need to redo that last shot.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.375
Wait, she's trying
to say something!

00:51.375 --> 00:54.500
Well, she's trying to make a
kiss. She wants to kiss us.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.792
Oh, look at me,
my eyes are watering. [sobs]

00:56.792 --> 00:59.709
Do you want to make a kiss?
Oh, yes, we're so happy too.

00:59.709 --> 01:03.208
- Oh, we love you too!
- Who are you?

01:12.208 --> 01:15.041
- Retro-what, now?
- Retrograde amnesia.

01:15.041 --> 01:18.625
Her general knowledge is intact,
but no personal memories.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.166
For now, she can't recall
anything about her life.

01:21.166 --> 01:24.500
Not you, her friends,
her high school prom,

01:24.500 --> 01:28.125
- not her eighth birthday party.
- This is awful.

01:28.125 --> 01:31.333
I worked my fingers
to the bone on that party.

01:31.333 --> 01:36.709
Samantha? I'm your father,
Howard J. Newly. Here's my card.

01:36.709 --> 01:38.625
And this is your friend, Dena.

01:38.625 --> 01:41.834
- She came every day
you were out.
- How long?

01:41.834 --> 01:43.500
- Nineteen years.
- What?

01:43.500 --> 01:46.166
Eight days. He's kidding.
Howard, honestly!

01:47.875 --> 01:50.875
Honey, your Aunt Polly called.
Don't forget to call her back.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.875
- I don't know Aunt Polly.
- Aunt Polly.

01:53.875 --> 01:56.041
- I'm sorry.
- Aunt Polly.

01:56.041 --> 02:00.000
- I'm not sure that
you're getting this.
- Aunt Polly!

02:00.000 --> 02:03.083
Regina, yelling doesn't help.

02:03.083 --> 02:06.583
- Your cousin Kevin's mom.
- [groans]

02:06.583 --> 02:09.875
Is she in another one of her
comas? Get the video camera.

02:10.959 --> 02:13.917
- Just kiss him.
- I don't know him.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.875
The doctor said familiar things
might jog your memory.

02:16.875 --> 02:20.875
You and Todd have a life
together. You have to go
home with someone.

02:20.875 --> 02:25.834
I can either go home with a
total stranger or the people
who raised me.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.375
Wow, this should be
an easier choice.

02:28.375 --> 02:32.583
Just kiss him. Maybe it'll
trigger something... like
Sleeping Beauty.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.375
You don't have to kiss me.
Maybe there's something else.

02:35.375 --> 02:38.750
- Electric shock.
- Howard, no, we talked
about that.

02:39.917 --> 02:42.250
- Maybe just one kiss.
- Hmm?

02:42.250 --> 02:43.917
Yeah.

02:43.917 --> 02:47.959
I mean, you know, got to
try something, right? OK.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.875
- [checks breath]
- OK, you're good.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.792
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:59.792 --> 03:03.667
It's just too weird! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I have to go home
with them.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.125
Well, here we are.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.959
Oh. [chuckles]

03:10.959 --> 03:12.834
Oh, this is nice.

03:12.834 --> 03:15.166
Oh, it's the same
as it's always been.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.875
We're due for one of those home
makeovers, but, uh, oh, well.

03:18.875 --> 03:22.375
Why don't you take
Samantha's things upstairs?

03:22.375 --> 03:25.875
So? Getting anything?

03:27.291 --> 03:31.000
- Oh, hey, a piano.
- Uh-huh. Piano.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.750
- Let's see if I can play.
- [off-key chords]

03:33.750 --> 03:34.917
No.

03:34.917 --> 03:36.625
Some things you can just ask.

03:36.625 --> 03:42.333
Oh, there she is! Oh, I am
so sorry I have not seen you.

03:42.333 --> 03:46.709
I've been in court. You don't
know what they're putting me
though on this case.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.375
It has been such a week.

03:48.375 --> 03:52.041
- Oh, please say
you'll forgive me.
- I forgive you... [chuckles]

03:52.041 --> 03:56.000
- ...uh, person
in the red dress.
- Oh, that's right.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.125
You don't know me.
Oh, my God, of course not.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.792
[loudly] I'm Andrea!

04:00.792 --> 04:03.417
I'm your best friend
in the whole world!

04:03.417 --> 04:05.417
- Oh.
- So, what is this
thing you have?

04:05.417 --> 04:08.250
- Retro-what-what?
- Retrograde amnesia.

04:08.250 --> 04:11.959
You wake up, you can't
remember anything you've done,
who you've met.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.333
Oh, God, I have that
every morning.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.041
Ms. Newly, can you
give me a little top-off?

04:17.041 --> 04:20.208
- I seem to have
found the champagne.
- [Regina] I'll bet you did.

04:20.208 --> 04:23.875
If you had that nose like that
for truffles, we'd all be rich.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.083
Come on. Come on.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.291
My car's pointed down
the driveway, let's go.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.250
Wait, wait. No, wait. Go where?

04:30.250 --> 04:33.291
- Beyond their
gravitational pull.
- What, these two?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.041
What is it? Do we not get along?

04:35.041 --> 04:37.709
You get along fine.
You haven't spoken in two years.

04:37.709 --> 04:40.417
- What?
- Here you go, Andrea.

04:40.417 --> 04:42.417
You might want to switch
drinking arms.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.625
You don't want to
bulk up on one side.

04:44.625 --> 04:46.458
We haven't spoken in two years?

04:46.458 --> 04:48.041
Yes, we have. Who said? Her?

04:48.041 --> 04:49.750
Don't listen to her.
She's a drunk.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.083
What happened?
Did we have a fight?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.500
- I don't recall.
- How can you not recall?

04:54.500 --> 04:58.083
- How can you not recall?
- I have amnesia.
You're just lying.

04:58.083 --> 05:01.083
Why dwell on ancient history?
You don't know the difference.

05:01.083 --> 05:05.041
I need to know the truth.
Especially about my family.

05:05.041 --> 05:09.625
This is where I came from.
I mean, you made me who I am.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.041
That is a terrible thing to say.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.083
Apologize to your mother,
young lady.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.917
Oh, look, I think
I left my car running.

05:21.709 --> 05:25.208
OK, I am gonna live with you
but in a separate room or on
the couch,

05:25.208 --> 05:27.375
and I am not gonna
have sex with you,

05:27.375 --> 05:31.208
so you can just get that
out of your mind, mister.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.542
- [woman] Dave?
Who is that woman?
- No idea.

05:36.041 --> 05:39.125
- Sam? Hey, it's this one.
- [gasps]

05:40.125 --> 05:41.125
Oh.

05:47.667 --> 05:50.375
[Todd] So this is the,
uh, living room.

05:50.375 --> 05:54.125
You can see the hardwoods floors
and the crown molding.

05:54.125 --> 05:59.750
There's a window right there
for seeing... out.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.333
- Sorry, I don't know
what I'm saying.
- No, it's OK. It's OK.

06:03.333 --> 06:06.542
And I'm sorry too, Tom, this has
got to be so weird for you.

06:06.542 --> 06:11.125
No, no, no, no, it's fine.
It's fine. And it's...
It's Todd, by the way.

06:11.125 --> 06:15.750
Oh, God. Todd. Todd, right.
Know what, I should be writing
this stuff down.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.166
[Todd] And that's,
uh, that's the bathroom.

06:18.166 --> 06:23.166
Oh, and, uh, down there, that's
the, uh, the bed... bedroom.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.875
Awkward.

06:28.125 --> 06:31.709
Todd, there are messages
on this machine. You mind
if I listen to them?

06:31.709 --> 06:32.959
Sure. Go for it.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.709
- [beep]
- Message one.

06:34.709 --> 06:38.125
[man] Todd, just wanted you
to know, whoever tried to run
Sam down,

06:38.125 --> 06:42.083
we're gonna find that guy. And
we're gonna buy him a drink!

06:42.083 --> 06:43.333
[machine] Message two.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.750
[man 2] Todd, it's probably
quiet without Sam,

06:45.750 --> 06:49.959
so if you want, Mark and I can
come by and bitch at you for no
reason at all.

06:49.959 --> 06:51.166
[machine beeps]

06:52.959 --> 06:56.417
I don't know those guys. Those
guys came with the machine.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.417
- OK, what's the deal?
- With what?

06:58.417 --> 07:02.208
With us. I mean, did we
get along, did we fight?

07:02.208 --> 07:04.917
We're both very
passionate people.

07:04.917 --> 07:07.875
So then it's a yes on "fight."
What else do we do together?

07:07.875 --> 07:10.667
- Watch sports...
- Sports.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.083
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.667
...when I can get you
to stop cooking for me.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.166
I don't think
that I believe you.

07:17.166 --> 07:19.125
And yet you must.
This is awesome.

07:19.125 --> 07:22.208
- [cell phone ringing]
- Ooh, ooh! Maybe it's someone.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.083
Let's see.

07:25.083 --> 07:28.542
Oh, it's Andrea. It says her
name. That's cool. Hello?

07:28.542 --> 07:32.667
Where are you? It's René's
birthday. Everybody's here.
Did you forget?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.500
OK, Andrea?

07:34.500 --> 07:38.333
What does "complete memory loss"
mean to you?

07:38.333 --> 07:40.792
It means I am here alone.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.583
Hurry up. Put something
fabulous on. See you at Eight.

07:43.583 --> 07:45.917
OK. All right, uh, goodbye.
Come on.

07:48.041 --> 07:51.041
What? Whoa. Easy now, tiger.
Where are we going?

07:51.041 --> 07:55.000
Renee is having a party,
so we have to go see Renee.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.291
- Who's Renee?
- Uh, a work friend.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.750
I don't know her.
You met her at a conference.

07:59.750 --> 08:03.625
- You see her
at out-of-town things.
- Go get changed. Not in here.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.250
Me? No. No, no, no, I don't go.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.417
No. No, come on, you have to go.
It's a birthday party.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.250
- It'll be, you know, fun.
- Even though you regard
birthdays

08:12.250 --> 08:15.250
as childish ploys for harvesting
attention and gifts?

08:15.250 --> 08:18.291
- Oh, when did I say that?
- When you forgot mine.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.792
Again. Awkward.

08:20.792 --> 08:23.041
Look, if you need me to,
I'll go.

08:23.041 --> 08:26.834
Yes, I do. And I will call
that Dena girl and I'll make
her come and...

08:26.834 --> 08:29.709
Oh, my God! I have a daughter?

08:32.291 --> 08:34.583
Whoa.

08:34.583 --> 08:39.041
[Samantha] Good things about
amnesia: all new clothes,
no reruns.

08:39.041 --> 08:42.041
Bad: every minute
is like that dream

08:42.041 --> 08:45.375
where you haven't been to class
all year and the test is now.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.667
Oh, no, I left my notebook
in the car.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.291
Oh, you know what? I'll get it.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.792
Oh, Todd, thank you so much
for coming with me.

08:52.792 --> 08:54.709
I'm so sorry that I'm so needy.

08:54.709 --> 08:57.291
It's just I can't explain this,
you know?

08:57.291 --> 09:00.709
Everybody knows things about me,
and I know absolutely nothing.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.917
I just feel unarmed, you know?

09:02.917 --> 09:07.000
It's like I'm like freaking out.
You know? Like... blaah!

09:07.000 --> 09:10.333
OK. Uh, you love Elvis Costello.
You hate opera.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.291
You take Gummy Bear vitamins
because you can't swallow pills

09:13.291 --> 09:15.291
and always sneeze
three times in a row.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.792
You never leave me any blankets

09:16.792 --> 09:18.625
'cause you ball them up
in your hands

09:18.625 --> 09:21.166
when you sleep
like a little girl.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.000
[♪ Gwen Stefani:
The Sweet Escape ]

09:24.000 --> 09:26.583
- That should hold you
till I get back.
- OK.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.333
Good evening. Welcome to Eight.
Can I take your coat?

09:35.208 --> 09:36.333
Here you go.

09:40.542 --> 09:45.041
Hey. Friends. Strangers.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.834
Whoa, whoa!

09:48.667 --> 09:51.625
Where have you been? No one's
heard from you in two weeks.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.125
You're mad at me, aren't you?
I'll make it up to you.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.333
I... can't swallow pills.

10:06.625 --> 10:09.709
Excuse me. Bye.
Nice to meet you.

10:11.834 --> 10:15.375
Whoo-hoo! Yay!
You made it.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.750
[air kisses]

10:17.750 --> 10:21.125
OK, just now?
Some guy just kissed me.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.458
Oh, just one?
You're off your game.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.875
Here, have a drink.
René's waiting for you.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.417
Good, good. OK,
which one is she?

10:28.417 --> 10:31.208
I should write this down.
No, I don't have my notebook.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.000
- I got it. I got it.
- Hold this.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.959
Ready? OK, write this down.
One: René is a "he."

10:36.959 --> 10:39.667
- OK. René is a he.
- Two, René is your lover.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.750
He is my lover.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.375
I'm sure that's wrong
because Todd is my...

10:46.667 --> 10:48.083
Ding, ding, ding!

10:49.041 --> 10:51.250
- Oh, I'm bad.
- Oh, yeah.

10:53.417 --> 10:54.417
Hi.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.417
So that's René? My work friend?

11:00.417 --> 11:03.417
That's René.

11:03.417 --> 11:04.792
Well, who's that?

11:04.792 --> 11:06.417
His wife. We don't like her.

11:06.417 --> 11:08.041
- Write that down.
- Andrea?

11:08.041 --> 11:11.500
- Andrea.
- Todd is gonna
be here any second!

11:11.500 --> 11:13.500
Are you crazy?
Why would you invite Todd?

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
I don't know.
I thought my boyfriends

11:15.500 --> 11:17.458
might like to have
a little playdate.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.667
Hey, there you are. Hi!

11:20.834 --> 11:23.000
I got here before you guys.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.959
I'm always early.
I can't help it.

11:24.959 --> 11:28.917
Always convinced the address
is fake, or everyone's standing
in a window

11:28.917 --> 11:32.458
watching me until I just leave.
So... [sighs]

11:32.458 --> 11:35.542
- Why is she talking to us?
- It's Dena.

11:35.542 --> 11:38.792
- Samantha's friend.
- Oh, I don't think so. No.

11:38.792 --> 11:41.458
No, I am.

11:41.458 --> 11:44.583
Oh, God, there's Todd.
I gotta get him out of here.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.333
I am.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.875
Yeah.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.417
Hey, Todd. Todd.
Todd, hey, listen,

11:54.417 --> 11:57.750
know how you were so nice
to come and I really needed
you here? Well...

11:57.750 --> 11:59.208
- You're good?
- I'm good.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.208
- See you.
- Yeah, OK.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.458
- I need my coat.
- Oh, in a minute.

12:03.458 --> 12:06.291
OK, come on.
Tell her that you lied.

12:06.291 --> 12:10.250
OK, Samantha, we're gonna
find this so funny later.

12:10.250 --> 12:13.375
- What?
- Right?

12:13.375 --> 12:15.500
We are not that close now.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.875
- What? What?
- But we were,
up until seventh grade...

12:20.375 --> 12:23.875
...when you became more popular
and I became less and less.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.542
- Oh, yeah.
- Much less.

12:25.542 --> 12:28.750
And I heard what happened,
and I went to the hospital.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.083
Everybody thought
we were still friends.

12:31.083 --> 12:35.208
Oh, and your poor mom.
God, she was just so happy
you had a friend.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.792
So, you know, I just...

12:37.792 --> 12:40.041
I just kept coming back.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.667
See? It's pretty funny, right?

12:45.375 --> 12:49.917
OK, so, um... besides Todd,
who I've betrayed,

12:49.917 --> 12:51.917
I only have one friend?

12:51.917 --> 12:54.542
Honey, I am the only
friend you need.

12:54.542 --> 12:57.542
I said I need my coat.

12:57.542 --> 13:00.166
Listen, I know you're
in a hurry to get to work,

13:00.166 --> 13:03.291
but trust me, your street
corner's still gonna be there.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.542
[gasps]

13:06.542 --> 13:08.709
My baby's still in there!

13:08.709 --> 13:11.000
Oh, come here.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.583
Come on, let's go
and talk to René.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.250
I don't want to talk to René.
Coat, please.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.417
- Who's René?
- Come on. Her guy.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.625
- No, no, no. Todd is her guy.
- Todd is my guy.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.125
She doesn't even know Todd.

13:22.125 --> 13:23.792
Now we can finally
get rid of him.

13:23.792 --> 13:26.333
- Why am I talking to you?
- Wait a minute.

13:26.333 --> 13:29.333
Why do I want to end it with
him? Is it a bad relationship?

13:29.333 --> 13:32.458
- Maybe we could
have worked on it?
- [Dena] But Todd is so nice.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.792
If he was my boyfriend, I would
lock the door

13:34.792 --> 13:37.875
and never let him
out of the house.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.583
Which was a problem before.
It is not now.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.542
Choose René. He is fun.
He is sexy.

13:43.542 --> 13:45.542
He gets us floor seats
and he has a plane.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.500
And a wife. He's a cheater.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.917
And so are you.
You're perfect for each other!

13:49.917 --> 13:53.458
- No, maybe not now.
People can change.
- People can change.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.625
People cannot change.
They are who they are.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.083
If people could change,
would you be you?

13:58.083 --> 13:59.959
She makes a good point.

13:59.959 --> 14:03.000
Samantha, I'm paying
no attention to you,
it's unforgivable.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.125
Listen, I'm leaving.
So happy birthday!
I got you some earrings.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.291
- Don't ask.
- What? No, don't do this.

14:10.291 --> 14:12.375
Let's go somewhere. Hawaii.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.709
- Tomorrow.
- Tonight.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.458
- Let's go to Holland.
- Oh, Holland.

14:16.458 --> 14:18.625
You choose. I'm leaving Marie.

14:18.625 --> 14:22.125
Tonight. Right after the cake.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.375
I like cake.

14:24.375 --> 14:26.375
How many times in a row
do I sneeze?

14:26.375 --> 14:28.417
Why, do you have a cold?

14:28.417 --> 14:31.583
Why didn't you tell me before
I kissed you? I have a meeting!

14:31.583 --> 14:34.291
You're right, Andrea.
We are perfect for each other.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.500
- I just don't want to be.
- [groans]

14:36.500 --> 14:38.750
- Oh, here.
Got you some earrings.
- Oh!

14:38.750 --> 14:42.041
"One day at a time.
Thirty days."

14:42.041 --> 14:45.166
I'm an alcoholic? Andrea!

14:47.208 --> 14:49.250
Worst thirty days of my life.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.291
Are there any newcomers tonight?

14:54.291 --> 14:57.083
Uh, me.

14:57.083 --> 15:01.333
Or not. I don't know.

15:01.333 --> 15:05.250
I mean, maybe I'm a regular
here. You tell me. I'm Samantha.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.125
[all] Hi, Samantha!

15:07.125 --> 15:10.000
That doesn't answer my question.
Um, I'll be right there.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.583
OK, just one second.
I just want to grab something.

15:12.583 --> 15:15.875
Maybe I like, uh... carrot cake.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.500
Let's try that.

15:18.792 --> 15:22.417
Oh, God. No.
Oh, my God. I don't.

15:22.417 --> 15:25.417
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm just
gonna get a muffin then.

15:25.417 --> 15:27.834
Some kind of muffin.
Banana. But it has nuts.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.333
I could be allergic to nuts,
and then I might die.

15:30.333 --> 15:33.208
Oh, an apple muffin!
Do you have doughnuts?

15:33.208 --> 15:36.875
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- No. One drink, I swear.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.375
- How long since
your last meeting?
- I don't know.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.500
I've been unconscious
for eight days.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.375
No, no, no, no.
Not like that.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.917
Oh, see, um, I, um...

15:45.917 --> 15:49.375
Listen, I... I hit my head,

15:49.375 --> 15:51.834
and then I lost my memory.

15:51.834 --> 15:54.792
Yeah, like a cartoon, right?

15:54.792 --> 15:58.375
And see, at first,
my problem was is that
I didn't know who I was,

15:58.375 --> 16:02.834
but now my problem is
that I do know who I was
and I really hate it.

16:02.834 --> 16:05.458
And I really want to change,
but maybe I can't.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.750
"I yam what I yam." Popeye.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.333
That, I remember.

16:10.333 --> 16:14.417
- I just want
to make good choices.
- Try the lemon squares.

16:14.417 --> 16:17.458
Yeah, but that's it.
That's my point.

16:17.458 --> 16:21.375
OK, I can... I can go have
a bite of the lemon square,
you know...

16:21.375 --> 16:25.458
Mmm-mmm. Chew, chew, chew.
That's really good.

16:25.458 --> 16:30.250
But does that desire alone
make me a lemon square person?

16:30.250 --> 16:34.583
Or am I just really, uh,
a blueberry tart person?

16:34.583 --> 16:38.125
Mmm. Who just really,
really wants to be

16:38.125 --> 16:41.458
a sweet, lovely, little
lemon square person

16:41.458 --> 16:46.458
but is just destined to wake up
day after day a freaking
blueberry tart!

16:49.166 --> 16:50.417
I think you should leave.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.500
But I'm an alcoholic.

16:53.500 --> 16:56.417
- Don't care.
- OK.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.458
I'm taking this.
I really like this.

17:00.458 --> 17:02.083
I'm going to write that down.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.000
- Is that coffee cake?
- [man] Out.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.667
- I know.
- [all] Bye, Samantha!

17:23.333 --> 17:25.166
Did you see that?
What I just did?

17:25.166 --> 17:27.917
I walked by you. I didn't
say hi. I didn't say thanks.

17:27.917 --> 17:30.625
I don't know your name.
What kind of person does that?

17:30.625 --> 17:33.000
It's scary. It really is.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.500
Frank.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.250
Hi, Frank.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.709
[Samantha] Essay question,
answer in complete sentences:

17:50.709 --> 17:54.917
If you could start over,
rewind your life, do it all
differently,

17:54.917 --> 17:56.542
what would you change?

17:56.542 --> 17:59.709
Even if that change
was hard and scary

17:59.709 --> 18:03.041
and might leave you
even more alone.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.542
Todd?

18:06.542 --> 18:07.709
[Todd] Yeah?

18:09.667 --> 18:11.417
René is a guy.

18:14.250 --> 18:17.000
I knew it.
I knew something was up!

18:17.000 --> 18:20.083
I am really, really sorry.
But look, if it helps,

18:20.083 --> 18:23.417
I don't even know what I did,
so it's like not doing it
at all.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.333
- Going with
the insanity defense?
- Yes. How's it playing?

18:26.333 --> 18:29.542
- Not well!
- OK, I don't blame you
for being mad.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.750
- OK? But could...
- No.

18:30.750 --> 18:31.959
- What?
- Mad?

18:31.959 --> 18:34.375
No, I'm not mad.
I'm grateful.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.667
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.959
'Cause your grateful face, it
looks a lot like your mad face.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.959
No, you know what I am?
Relieved.

18:40.959 --> 18:44.750
Because you finally gave me
the excuse I needed to break up
with you.

18:44.750 --> 18:48.458
But she did it! Bad Sam.
Break up with her.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.500
- I already did!
- When?

18:51.500 --> 18:54.458
Right before the accident.

18:54.458 --> 18:58.000
OK, look, we met at the
coffee place. I told you,
you left upset,

18:58.000 --> 19:01.083
- next you're in the hospital.
- We met at the coffee place.

19:01.083 --> 19:04.875
- Yes. I just told you that.
- No, we met at
the coffee place.

19:04.875 --> 19:07.875
It's where we first met.
I remember!

19:07.875 --> 19:11.250
- [steam hissing]
- Decaf latte.

19:12.375 --> 19:13.625
Hmm.

19:14.667 --> 19:20.583
OK, Todd. Double latte for Todd.

19:20.583 --> 19:23.500
- Todd!
- Yep, it's mine. Thanks.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.667
Sorry, I was outside.
Whoa! Is that mine?

19:25.667 --> 19:27.583
- No. It's mine.
- Your name is Todd?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.709
- Mm-hmm.
- Me too.

19:29.709 --> 19:32.709
Oh, well, good. Then I'll
see you at the Todd Club.

19:32.709 --> 19:34.583
Hey, can I take your picture?

19:34.583 --> 19:36.166
Really, mister?

19:36.166 --> 19:39.166
Are you one of them
photographers who's
looking for models?

19:39.166 --> 19:42.583
I wanna show the cops a picture
of the girl who stole my latte.
Smile.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.792
- Oh, good.
- That's gonna make
a great mugshot.

19:45.792 --> 19:47.083
I'll add it to the pile.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.625
Wow. That Sam.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.333
What a... a nut.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.417
Yep.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.041
Um...

20:00.041 --> 20:02.208
I guess I'll, um... go.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.417
Oh, right. Sorry.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.667
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.500
- [makes noises]
- [both chuckle]

20:14.500 --> 20:16.041
That's weird.

20:23.875 --> 20:26.417
You know what's crazy?

20:26.417 --> 20:30.667
I mean, I'll bet that you know
more about my life than I do.
Huh?

20:30.667 --> 20:34.417
I mean, just standing out here,
watching me come and go every
night?

20:34.417 --> 20:36.667
Except Thursdays.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.458
Thursdays I have my
screenwriting class.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.667
- How's that going?
- It's going well.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.667
Good.

20:46.667 --> 20:50.083
So where do you go from here?

20:50.083 --> 20:52.125
[sighs]

20:52.125 --> 20:54.709
God, that is the question, huh?

20:54.709 --> 20:58.500
I guess I'll go back to work.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.834
Try to form some
healthier relationships.

21:01.834 --> 21:04.917
Make better friends,
make some better choices.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.709
I meant eastbound or west.

21:07.709 --> 21:11.834
Oh, um... I'm sorry. I don't...

21:13.250 --> 21:15.333
There's a Tom Waits song.

21:15.333 --> 21:19.291
"If you get far enough away,
you'll be on your way back
home."

21:20.542 --> 21:22.875
Wow, yeah.

21:24.959 --> 21:27.709
OK, what does that mean?

21:27.709 --> 21:32.083
If you're trying to tell
a story, you'd best start
at the beginning.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.375
Oh.

21:34.375 --> 21:37.417
- I'm sorry, one more time?
- Go home.

21:37.417 --> 21:40.709
[♪ Rupert Holmes:
Escape (The Piña Colada Song) ]

21:44.291 --> 21:47.000
OK, so before I come in,
just tell me,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.291
you're not the one
who tried to run me down.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.917
Howard! She's back!

21:51.917 --> 21:54.208
- That's not an answer.
- Use your old room.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.875
- You know where it is.
- Uh, no, I don't.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.542
Well, just guess.
Come on, it'll be fun.

22:08.417 --> 22:10.542
You know,
just one more question.

22:10.542 --> 22:13.208
Is there any chance
that I was adopted?
