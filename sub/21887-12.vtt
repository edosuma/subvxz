39:36.716 --> 39:37.947
I came to you?

39:39.068 --> 39:40.359
Paid in cash.

39:40.589 --> 39:42.691
Said The Doc was holding you back.

39:42.777 --> 39:45.521
She has to die, or you can't be free.

39:45.669 --> 39:49.989
- Oh, God.
- I put myself at great risk for you.

39:50.027 --> 39:53.117
Cops came to my workshop;
I can't go back there.

39:53.164 --> 39:54.697
- My son...
- Let go of him!

39:54.732 --> 39:56.632
Get down, Ed!

39:57.843 --> 40:00.069
What the hell were you thinking,
going after him alone?

40:00.104 --> 40:02.238
Well, clearly I wasn't thinking.

40:02.273 --> 40:04.039
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

40:05.216 --> 40:06.791
Damn it.

40:08.487 --> 40:10.579
Did he say anything about who hired him?

40:11.362 --> 40:13.810
Uh, it was him, uh, all him.

40:13.864 --> 40:15.251
He was a lone wolf, that's what he said.

40:15.294 --> 40:16.914
He-he was, he was afraid

40:16.950 --> 40:18.821
of what Lee was gonna do to the Narrows.

40:18.856 --> 40:20.389
Are you sure?
His son said he was talking

40:20.424 --> 40:22.091
to somebody on the phone about The Doc.

40:22.126 --> 40:24.059
Yeah, he-he said, he said
that he was calling around,

40:24.095 --> 40:25.661
trying to get support,
but no one would help him,

40:25.696 --> 40:27.196
so he went it alone. Crazy.

40:27.231 --> 40:28.531
Crazy loon.

40:28.566 --> 40:29.999
He told you all that?

40:30.034 --> 40:32.101
Obviously, I'm not much of a threat.

40:32.136 --> 40:34.703
I'm so lucky that you
came out here, Jim.

40:34.739 --> 40:35.747
I don't know what I
would have done if...

40:35.772 --> 40:37.506
This is Captain Gordon.

40:37.542 --> 40:39.675
I have a suspect down,
outside Cherry's Place

40:39.710 --> 40:41.377
on State Street in the Narrows.

40:41.794 --> 40:44.067
Send all available units.

40:46.826 --> 40:49.427
Nice job, Ed, I guess.

40:53.891 --> 40:56.928
I'm back. (LAUGHS)

41:00.765 --> 41:02.765
(INDISTINCT RADIO TRANSMISSION)

41:05.970 --> 41:07.469
Move.

41:12.476 --> 41:14.755
Of all the beer halls in the city, huh?

41:15.271 --> 41:17.079
Who was it that that jerk killed?

41:17.114 --> 41:19.081
(DOOR CLOSING)

41:19.116 --> 41:20.783
A lady.

41:21.786 --> 41:23.619
A very beautiful,

41:24.357 --> 41:26.589
kind, nice lady.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.742
Then I drink to her.

41:36.067 --> 41:38.067
(ENGINE STARTS)

41:39.704 --> 41:41.770
- (SIREN WAILING)
- Heard the call on the radio.

41:44.809 --> 41:46.609
Don't worry, we'll get him to talk.

41:51.521 --> 41:53.182
How you been?

41:53.919 --> 41:55.583
Awesome.

42:03.635 --> 42:05.121
I missed you.

42:09.233 --> 42:11.535
Is that so?

42:13.471 --> 42:15.199
Well, I haven't missed you.

42:15.373 --> 42:17.673
I haven't missed begging you
not to do something

42:17.708 --> 42:19.808
just to watch you go ahead
and do it anyway.

42:19.973 --> 42:21.844
Haven't missed watching you bang

42:21.879 --> 42:24.813
Falcone's daughter while she
uses you to get rid of Penguin.

42:26.550 --> 42:28.283
Something's eating at you, Jim.

42:28.319 --> 42:29.593
I don't know what it is,

42:29.648 --> 42:31.487
but you're no good at keeping secrets.

42:31.522 --> 42:32.888
And you're not gonna feel clean

42:32.923 --> 42:34.679
until you get it off your chest.

42:35.632 --> 42:39.062
(LAUGHS) You didn't come down here
because you miss me as a cop.

42:39.335 --> 42:41.630
You came here to confess.

42:41.666 --> 42:42.865
You want me to be your priest.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.500
Well, sorry, pal,

42:44.535 --> 42:46.702
I'm not interested.

42:48.706 --> 42:50.973
So hit the bricks.

42:51.008 --> 42:52.708
Take that with you.
