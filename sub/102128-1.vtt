00:01.212 --> 00:03.879
(film clicking)

00:11.187 --> 00:13.770
(mellow music)

00:39.829 --> 00:41.900
- What can I do for you today?

00:41.900 --> 00:44.760
- I just want some insight I guess

00:44.760 --> 00:47.160
about what the future brings.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.820
- Have you done a reading before?

00:48.820 --> 00:50.850
- Never had a reading done before.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.750
- So is it anything in particular
that you're looking for?

00:58.040 --> 01:00.290
I suggest we go for a deep reading.

01:00.290 --> 01:01.373
How does that sound?

01:03.370 --> 01:04.203
- Yeah.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.460
- Whatever the cards tell me, good or bad,

01:13.460 --> 01:14.573
I'm going to tell you.

01:16.760 --> 01:20.160
The fool indicates mistakes
that we make in life,

01:20.160 --> 01:22.170
like foolish decisions.

01:22.170 --> 01:24.750
The devil tells me that

01:24.750 --> 01:26.970
there's temptation too far away

01:26.970 --> 01:29.200
and you really have to be careful.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.850
The moon indicates that
your aspirations or dreams,

01:32.850 --> 01:35.463
they're probably a distant reality.

01:37.451 --> 01:40.203
- Does that mean my
dreams are within reach?

01:41.610 --> 01:43.490
- Well, not necessarily.

01:43.490 --> 01:45.540
I can see success in life,

01:45.540 --> 01:48.320
but it can be in a different area

01:48.320 --> 01:50.580
that is unknown right now to you.

01:50.580 --> 01:54.160
'Cause I can see strengths
and I can see new beginnings

01:54.160 --> 01:57.210
but maybe not in the field

01:57.210 --> 02:00.090
that you are at right now.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.993
- Does that mean that I don't
have a future in Hollywood?

02:04.650 --> 02:06.543
- [Psychic] You're gonna
find out with time.

- Appreciate it. Thanks.

03:56.154 --> 03:56.987
- Hi five.

04:06.238 --> 04:09.294
- Only way to make it in this
world is by being strong.

04:09.294 --> 04:12.627
If you fail, you got to get yourself up.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.790
- Staring at the star of Marilyn Monroe.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.870
- Yes, she's one of my favorites.

05:51.870 --> 05:53.050
- She was fabulous.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.400
Oh wow, wasn't she?

05:54.400 --> 05:58.690
- Yeah. Way before my time
but definitely an idol.

05:58.690 --> 05:59.710
- Yeah.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.070
Such a powerful performer.

06:01.070 --> 06:05.353
She made a big difference
for women at that time.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.500
- She's one of the reasons I'm even here.

06:10.580 --> 06:11.630
- So where are you from?

06:11.630 --> 06:14.142
- Oh, I'm from Oakland, California.

06:14.142 --> 06:15.400
- Oh!

06:15.400 --> 06:19.110
And so you came down here
to be a Hollywood star?

06:19.110 --> 06:20.470
- Yeah.

06:20.470 --> 06:22.103
I want to be an actress.

06:23.140 --> 06:24.440
- Wonderful.

06:24.440 --> 06:25.660
Why not?

06:25.660 --> 06:27.510
It's great to follow your dreams.

06:27.510 --> 06:28.510
- Right.

06:28.510 --> 06:31.140
I guess nothing beats a
fail but a try, right?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.106
- That's right.

06:32.106 --> 06:35.000
You'd probably regret it
forever if you didn't try.

06:35.000 --> 06:35.833
- Yeah.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.260
Yeah.

06:38.260 --> 06:39.110
- Well you're so lovely,

06:39.110 --> 06:40.730
you probably have a good chance.

06:40.730 --> 06:42.250
- Thank you.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.900
- I really hope it works for you.

06:45.350 --> 06:47.210
- It's the city of dreams.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.380
- For sure it is.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.030
You know, it doesn't work for everybody.

06:52.030 --> 06:53.780
Some people spend their whole lives here

06:53.780 --> 06:54.730
trying to make it happen.

06:54.730 --> 06:58.140
I've seen a lot of hopeless people

06:58.140 --> 07:00.833
a lot of performers on the street,

07:01.930 --> 07:03.590
who may not have made it.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.740
Are you ready for that?

07:06.390 --> 07:07.560
- Yeah.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.210
- But I think that if you work hard,

07:10.210 --> 07:11.780
you could be one of the very few

07:11.780 --> 07:14.260
that make it all the way to the top.

07:14.260 --> 07:16.240
- Yeah.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.200
Yeah. I hope so.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.880
- Well, there's always
risk involved, isn't there?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.350
- Yeah.

07:23.350 --> 07:24.823
- To achieve greatness.

07:26.340 --> 07:27.173
- Yeah.

07:28.150 --> 07:29.017
- Well I think you're lovely

07:29.017 --> 07:32.420
and I think that you
have a very good chance.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.890
- Thanks.

07:33.890 --> 07:35.340
Have a good day.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.173
- You too.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.330
Oh by the way,

07:41.330 --> 07:42.763
welcome to Hollywood.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.710
- So I overheard that shit.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.530
- Yeah.
- You can't listen to her.

08:05.530 --> 08:07.730
There's a lot of failed
people in his town,

08:07.730 --> 08:08.680
she's probably one of them.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.010
Some kind of failed the
actresses or some shit.

08:11.010 --> 08:13.290
If you want to be an
actress, be an actress.

08:13.290 --> 08:14.123
Do you.

08:14.123 --> 08:15.760
Nobody's gonna stop you.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.887
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.890
- Where you from?

08:18.890 --> 08:20.150
- Bay area, Oakland.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.560
- Some of my favorite
artists walked that way.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.570
- Oh, what artist you know from the Bay?

08:24.570 --> 08:26.140
- 'Pac, Hammer, Too Short.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.790
- Okay. Okay. Some of the best.

08:28.790 --> 08:30.033
- Yeah. Yeah.

08:33.260 --> 08:34.660
- Bro what is you doing man?

08:35.570 --> 08:37.000
We got CDs to sell man.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.189
You still talking to girls?

08:38.189 --> 08:39.022
Come on man.

08:39.022 --> 08:41.850
- All right, all right , all
right. I got you. I got you.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.120
Listen, I'ma get back to this.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.440
- Yeah.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.540
- We having a pool party later,

08:45.540 --> 08:46.373
you'd be down for that?

08:46.373 --> 08:47.686
- Are a lot of people going to be there?

08:47.686 --> 08:48.983
- There'll be some people there.

08:50.980 --> 08:51.890
- I'm new to LA.

08:51.890 --> 08:54.260
- Yeah, that's why you
need a mix of friends.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.640
Put your number on my phone.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.740
- Okay.
- All right.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.620
- Okay.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.170
- Now come to this party later.

09:05.710 --> 09:07.830
Listen, I know you like hip hop,

09:07.830 --> 09:09.370
I'm gonna give you one of these, right?

09:09.370 --> 09:10.890
Just don't tell my man
over there, all right?

09:10.890 --> 09:12.790
- Gonna stay between us.
- All right.

09:22.255 --> 09:24.922
(uptempo music)

09:40.750 --> 09:42.253
- Thanks for inviting me.

09:48.740 --> 09:50.734
So is this your house?

09:50.734 --> 09:52.010
- Yeah. Yeah.

09:52.010 --> 09:54.050
- Who do you live here with?

09:54.050 --> 09:56.540
- Oh, it was just me and some of my boys.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.110
- Some of your boys?

09:58.110 --> 09:59.600
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.180
Yeah, we're just kinda chill, you know?

10:02.180 --> 10:04.790
- It's a nice area, nice neighborhood.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.670
- It's all right.

10:05.670 --> 10:07.100
- It's nice.

10:07.100 --> 10:07.933
- Thank you.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.330
What have you been doing
all day since I seen you?

10:11.330 --> 10:12.163
- Today?

10:13.220 --> 10:14.780
I guess I just did some shopping

10:14.780 --> 10:16.830
for auditions I have coming up.

10:16.830 --> 10:17.663
- That's cool.

10:17.663 --> 10:19.350
I hear additions are rough though.

10:19.350 --> 10:20.560
- You know, different stores,

10:20.560 --> 10:22.260
trying to get some looks together.

10:24.504 --> 10:26.110
And then I tried to get home

10:26.110 --> 10:27.470
because I wanted to make sure

10:27.470 --> 10:29.323
I was ready for the party.

10:31.050 --> 10:33.650
So I might not stay too late tonight.

10:33.650 --> 10:34.483
- We'll see.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.173
- God, I hope this is a good move.

10:38.173 --> 10:40.910
- I think it's going to be good to you.

10:40.910 --> 10:41.743
- I hope so.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.980
- Let's go outside and find out.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.540
Hey y'all check it out,
it's my new friend, Mandy.

10:53.540 --> 10:54.373
- Hi.

10:55.476 --> 10:56.350
Nice to meet you.

10:56.350 --> 10:57.183
- What's going on?

10:57.183 --> 10:58.907
Steven, welcome to the jungle.

10:58.907 --> 11:00.267
- Nice to meet you.

11:00.267 --> 11:01.587
Hi.

11:01.587 --> 11:03.587
- Hey, I'm Kristin.

11:03.587 --> 11:05.203
- Alex.

11:05.203 --> 11:06.554
- Nice to meet you too.

11:06.554 --> 11:07.610
- What were y'all talking about?

11:07.610 --> 11:09.660
- This guy here man, he just moved to LA.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.420
- He was just telling
us a really good story.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.670
- I found an apartment online.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.110
- Not any of apartment, tell him about it.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.230
A mansion in the hills.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.377
- Guy said I could crash on the couch,

11:21.377 --> 11:23.777
and he wanted more than
just crashin' on the couch.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.490
Welcome to LA, right?

11:27.490 --> 11:29.190
- Welcome to LA.

11:29.190 --> 11:30.758
You're official now.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.790
- Listen,

11:31.790 --> 11:33.020
I lived with these two chicks

11:33.020 --> 11:34.630
for like nine straight months.

11:34.630 --> 11:37.900
And when I tell you that
girls are messier than guys.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.733
- No.

11:38.733 --> 11:40.080
- True.

11:40.080 --> 11:40.913
- No guys are worse.

11:40.913 --> 11:44.120
- I swear it was like
coming home to a tornado

11:44.120 --> 11:45.710
in the bathroom every single day.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.460
- Enough of this talk,
let's get her a drink.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.293
- Me?

11:49.450 --> 11:51.580
I don't really drink guys.

11:51.580 --> 11:52.770
- Come on, just one drink.

11:52.770 --> 11:54.495
- Guys I'm not going to stay for long.

11:54.495 --> 11:56.620
- Yeah you are. Come on, just one.

11:56.620 --> 11:57.653
- Welcome to LA.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.478
- Okay, just a little bit.

12:00.478 --> 12:03.740
(group cheers)

12:03.740 --> 12:04.723
- Cheers.

12:06.450 --> 12:08.143
To LA!
- LA baby.

12:14.196 --> 12:16.617
- I told you guys I don't drink.

12:16.617 --> 12:18.870
- All right guys, I'm gonna
go introduce everybody else.

12:18.870 --> 12:20.243
- See you guys in a few.

12:26.660 --> 12:27.910
- Check it out, this
is my new friend Mandy.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.420
- Hi guys.

12:29.420 --> 12:31.761
- We're having a pretty
interesting conversation.

12:31.761 --> 12:33.590
- I'm showing Charlie
about my first experience

12:33.590 --> 12:35.680
in the movie business out in LA

12:35.680 --> 12:37.720
is the hardcore movie business.

12:37.720 --> 12:38.820
Can't complain with that.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.049
- Say what?

12:40.049 --> 12:42.020
- Crazyasiangirlfriends.com.

12:42.020 --> 12:42.970
- You're gonna have to explain,

12:42.970 --> 12:44.120
why was it Asian chick?

12:47.040 --> 12:49.600
- You done one, you did them all man.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.129
- That's LA baby.

12:51.129 --> 12:52.030
- I see.

12:52.030 --> 12:54.228
- Hey Mandy, you know what?

12:54.228 --> 12:55.820
I think you need to
loosen up a little bit.

12:55.820 --> 12:57.490
Charlie has something for you over there.

12:57.490 --> 13:00.000
- Pure Californian coke.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.234
- No, I'm good guys.

13:01.234 --> 13:02.402
- This shit's pretty good.

13:02.402 --> 13:03.463
Just take a little bit like this

13:03.463 --> 13:04.753
cause this stuff's strong.

13:07.670 --> 13:08.620
Oh you're doing the pinkie,

13:08.620 --> 13:09.660

Yeah, you have to take some.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.620

13:19.620 --> 13:20.560
- I'm chilling. I'm drinking.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.757
- Small bump. Just one bump.

13:22.757 --> 13:25.296
- [Charlie] Why? I guess
you're not drinking.

13:25.296 --> 13:26.180

15:00.335 --> 15:01.717
I didn't know he was going to be doing it.

15:01.717 --> 15:03.920
- I'm not sure why he
was so pushy about it.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.710
- Is the drug scene
like super normal here?

15:06.710 --> 15:09.470
- Yeah, they do that a
lot actually out here.

15:09.470 --> 15:11.120

Fuck.

23:48.004 --> 23:48.837
Fuck.

23:58.178 --> 24:00.011
This is the alley way.

24:04.637 --> 24:07.770
How the fuck am I supposed
to ball from here?

24:07.770 --> 24:08.603
Okay.

24:29.983 --> 24:32.560
I'm in the fucking projects.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.460
Fucking shit-hole!

24:39.393 --> 24:41.393
I'm never gonna get out.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.013
Help.

24:53.754 --> 24:55.171
Why me?

25:01.506 --> 25:03.556
I didn't ask for this.

25:03.556 --> 25:05.973
I didn't ask for any of this.

25:07.408 --> 25:08.241
Help!

25:09.676 --> 25:10.509
Help!

25:23.176 --> 25:24.009
Who is it?

25:31.383 --> 25:33.913
- Damn girl why is it so dark in here?

25:35.460 --> 25:37.200
- Who are you?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.600
- I'm Lola.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.700
I just came to bring you some food.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.493
I'm here just to check on you.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.743
So what's going on?

25:49.970 --> 25:50.873
- I don't know.

25:52.460 --> 25:55.263
I'm new to LA and I came
here to be an actress.

25:57.550 --> 25:58.820
But I was on Hollywood

25:58.820 --> 26:02.323
and I met a guy walking
down the Boulevard.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.193
He invited me to a pool party.

26:07.070 --> 26:09.610
I don't really remember what happened.

26:09.610 --> 26:10.640
- Oh wow.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.610
Then you end up here.

26:12.610 --> 26:14.340
Sounds familiar.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.240
I've been through everything
you're going through right now

26:17.240 --> 26:18.323
so my best advice to you

26:18.323 --> 26:20.740
is just to listen to everything he says

26:20.740 --> 26:22.903
and you won't get hurt.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.180
I know it's hard

26:25.180 --> 26:27.910
but if you want to survive
you have to hold up.

26:27.910 --> 26:28.743
Okay?

26:31.530 --> 26:34.430
Do you have anything to listen to this on?

26:34.430 --> 26:35.263
- No.

26:37.984 --> 26:41.340
- I might have something
for you when I come back.

26:41.340 --> 26:42.990
But in the meantime,

26:42.990 --> 26:45.170
I want you to eat your food

26:45.170 --> 26:47.020
and just take it easy and hold up

26:47.020 --> 26:49.710
and I'll be in the next room, okay?

26:49.710 --> 26:51.722
- Okay. Thanks.

26:51.722 --> 26:56.722
- Okay.

27:50.330 --> 27:51.323
- Guys?

27:54.810 --> 27:56.471
Hello?

27:56.471 --> 27:59.138
(hip hop music)

28:12.413 --> 28:15.297
I'm gonna fucking pee on myself!

28:15.297 --> 28:16.390
Please open the door.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.223
Open the door.

28:17.223 --> 28:18.381
Please, I won't tell anyone.

28:18.381 --> 28:19.780
I'll just go to the
bathroom and come back.

28:19.780 --> 28:20.613
Please, no.

28:20.613 --> 28:21.529
No, I hear you.

28:21.529 --> 28:22.903
I hear you.

28:22.903 --> 28:24.130
I hear you out there.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.543
Please open the fucking door.

28:30.871 --> 28:32.493
I just have to use the
bathroom, that's all.

28:32.493 --> 28:34.326
I just have to use it.

29:21.922 --> 29:24.672
(toilet flushes)

29:49.803 --> 29:51.773
- Ey, my nigga.

29:51.773 --> 29:54.952
Ey, that bitch good in there? What's up?

29:54.952 --> 29:56.243

29:56.243 --> 29:57.923
Fuck that bitch nigga.

29:57.923 --> 29:59.073

30:22.310 --> 30:23.512

30:23.512 --> 30:24.345
Let's go.

30:33.370 --> 30:35.203
Where's my fucking wine?

30:36.864 --> 30:37.697
Damn!

30:39.280 --> 30:40.540
Trying to fucking celebrate man,

30:40.540 --> 30:41.490

Hell yeah.

30:59.933 --> 31:02.363
That bitch gonna make me a
lot of money right there.

31:22.860 --> 31:24.360
- You're new here, aren't you?

31:25.642 --> 31:28.059
It's hot in this bitch.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.270
Don't be scared, I won't hurt.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.270
My friends call me Ahnal.

31:36.507 --> 31:37.340
You know why?

31:39.400 --> 31:40.233
I'm no fag,

31:41.532 --> 31:43.736

31:43.736 --> 31:45.069
Especially like yours.

31:46.224 --> 31:47.524
We're going to be friends.

31:48.491 --> 31:50.908
No, I'll be gentle.

31:55.933 --> 31:56.766
Come here.

32:00.931 --> 32:03.064
Fire in the hole.

32:03.064 --> 32:05.564
(tense music)

32:20.552 --> 32:23.255
(Mandy screams)

32:23.255 --> 32:25.588
(Ahnal moans)

32:46.933 --> 32:48.850
- You're gonna be okay.

32:51.415 --> 32:53.165
You're gonna be okay.

32:55.063 --> 32:56.813
You're gonna be okay.

33:06.374 --> 33:08.791
You're gonna get out of here.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.455
- Hello?

33:22.570 --> 33:24.453
Is everything okay in here?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.423
Mandy, are you all right?

33:34.210 --> 33:35.043
- Hey.

33:36.890 --> 33:39.200
- Brought you a CD player.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.883
Some music you can listen to.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.363
Girl, you did not eat your food?

33:55.730 --> 33:57.037
- Guess I wasn't hungry.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.720
- Girl, you have to eat.

34:00.720 --> 34:03.923
You have to stay strong and positive.

34:06.660 --> 34:08.740
I understand well.

34:08.740 --> 34:12.140
I might have something to cheer you up.

34:12.140 --> 34:14.603
I use it when I'm down or whatever.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.190
- What's that?

34:21.190 --> 34:22.350
- It's a joint.

34:22.350 --> 34:23.653
You should come try it.

34:24.580 --> 34:25.413
- Weed?

34:26.470 --> 34:27.303
- Yeah.

34:29.090 --> 34:30.260
Just weed?

34:30.260 --> 34:31.313
- Yeah, just weed.

34:33.990 --> 34:34.970
- Okay.

34:34.970 --> 34:36.430
- Just come take a puff.

34:36.430 --> 34:37.263
Chill.

35:00.050 --> 35:02.333
That should make you feel way better.

35:03.930 --> 35:06.426
And it might give you an appetite.

35:06.426 --> 35:09.009
(Mandy coughs)

35:14.350 --> 35:15.510
You should try more.

35:27.457 --> 35:29.903
I know you feel that.

35:29.903 --> 35:32.277
Doesn't that feel that way better?

35:32.277 --> 35:33.110
- It does.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.113
- Do you feel much better now?

35:49.698 --> 35:51.140
- Yeah.

35:51.140 --> 35:52.550
Yeah I do.
- That's great.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.883
As you should.

35:57.069 --> 35:58.770
And you're blazed girl.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.240
It hit you, huh?

36:01.240 --> 36:02.370
I told you.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.290
I see a smile on your face.

36:04.290 --> 36:05.573
- Compliments of you.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.373
You're pretty cool.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.323
- Yeah, well I have to be.

36:18.700 --> 36:21.870
- I appreciate you
bringing me the CD player.

36:21.870 --> 36:24.093
- No problem girl, you need it.

36:26.610 --> 36:29.900
And pretty soon you have to
get out of these clothes.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.110
Maybe you need new clothing.

36:32.110 --> 36:33.030
- Yeah.

36:33.030 --> 36:35.470
You could do that for me?

36:35.470 --> 36:38.380
- [Lola] Yeah, when I come
back I'll see what I have.

36:38.380 --> 36:40.890
A couple of pieces you can use.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.870
You need clean clothes,

36:42.870 --> 36:45.090
can't be in that all day.

36:45.090 --> 36:46.110
- Thanks.

36:46.110 --> 36:49.010
- Maybe we should wrap this up.

36:49.010 --> 36:51.010
I won't want Shadow to catch me in here.

36:53.569 --> 36:56.152
(Mandy coughs)

37:01.310 --> 37:02.343
How does that feel?

37:06.222 --> 37:07.600
- It's a lot better.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.020
- That's good.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.570
And you just take it easy, okay?

37:11.570 --> 37:12.403
- Yeah.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.560
Hey Lola?

37:14.560 --> 37:15.800
- Yeah?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.530
- You think that you can get me

37:18.920 --> 37:19.863
a notepad?

37:21.050 --> 37:22.313
And a pen?

37:23.690 --> 37:26.820
- Sure. I think I have something for you.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.210
I'll bring it back.

37:28.210 --> 37:30.233
Hmm, you like Jamaican food?

37:31.720 --> 37:32.800
- Yeah.

37:32.800 --> 37:33.840
- Well I have a little something

37:33.840 --> 37:35.200
one of the clients brought me earlier,

37:35.200 --> 37:37.410
but you can take it.

37:37.410 --> 37:38.350

45:24.150 --> 45:24.983

45:26.390 --> 45:27.223

45:28.553 --> 45:29.653
What you got going on?

45:30.930 --> 45:31.763

45:39.232 --> 45:40.342
- Let me see.

45:40.342 --> 45:41.560
- No.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.118
- Just let me read it.

45:43.118 --> 45:45.068
It cannot be that bad.

45:45.068 --> 45:48.622
Seriously there's no one in here.

45:48.622 --> 45:50.372
Just let me see.

45:50.372 --> 45:52.400
- It's really nothing.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.393
- I'm not judging.

45:57.401 --> 45:59.230
- It's just been something
to help the time pass.

45:59.230 --> 46:00.670
I swear it's-

46:00.670 --> 46:03.670
- Hey, this is some
really good stuff here.

46:03.670 --> 46:04.503
- Really?

46:04.503 --> 46:05.336
- Yeah, it is.

46:05.336 --> 46:07.400
This is some good stuff.

46:07.400 --> 46:08.703
Are you serious?

46:10.210 --> 46:11.260
- I'm so new to this.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.103
- Perform it.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.890
- You're kidding, right?

46:16.890 --> 46:18.603
- Let me just hear something.

46:20.190 --> 46:21.812
- [Mandy] You not gonna laugh?

46:21.812 --> 46:23.479
- I'm not gonna laugh.

46:26.210 --> 46:29.330
- I'll read you a couple
of lines to one of them.

46:29.330 --> 46:30.163
Sorry.

46:42.620 --> 46:44.320
My mom always told me

46:45.720 --> 46:47.773
better watch who you around.

46:50.090 --> 46:54.883
All my life I've seen ups and downs.

46:57.150 --> 47:01.113
One day G5 flights gon' get us around.

47:05.680 --> 47:07.620
When I get these millions,

47:07.620 --> 47:09.913
it's gon' be up and downs.

47:14.678 --> 47:16.820
- I like it. I like it. Give me more.

47:16.820 --> 47:17.762
Give me more.

47:17.762 --> 47:18.595
- I don't know.

47:18.595 --> 47:19.910
- Yes, it sounds good.

47:19.910 --> 47:21.410
Put a little more rhythm into it.

47:21.410 --> 47:22.443
You got to feel it.

47:24.817 --> 47:26.170
From the heart.

47:26.170 --> 47:27.810
- Okay, let's see.

47:27.810 --> 47:28.643
From the heart.

47:32.460 --> 47:36.163
Mama always told me you
better watch who you around.

47:39.510 --> 47:43.600
All my life I done seen ups, downs.

47:43.600 --> 47:47.003
G5 flights is what's gon' get us round.

47:49.640 --> 47:54.053
When I touch these millions,
it's going to be ups and downs.

47:54.053 --> 47:54.933
And downs.

47:56.220 --> 47:58.312
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

47:58.312 --> 47:59.240
What do you think?

47:59.240 --> 48:00.650
- It was fine

48:00.650 --> 48:03.880
but I have something
that's gonna loosen you up.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.340
- More weed?

48:05.340 --> 48:06.233
- No weed.

48:07.360 --> 48:09.530
Something even better.

48:09.530 --> 48:10.363
- Oh no.

48:17.772 --> 48:19.189
- Here, try some.

48:34.240 --> 48:35.983
- Lola, why do you do this?

48:38.950 --> 48:39.910
- It's just

48:39.910 --> 48:41.110
I'm pretty used to it.

48:41.110 --> 48:41.943
I have to.

48:41.943 --> 48:43.450
The clients come,

48:43.450 --> 48:44.400
they wanna do it so

48:45.260 --> 48:46.740
it's pretty natural.

48:46.740 --> 48:47.690
- But why?

48:47.690 --> 48:49.080
You don't have to do this.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.030
You don't have to do coke.

48:50.030 --> 48:51.240
You don't have to be here.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.050
You don't have to go through any of this.

48:53.050 --> 48:55.100
You're too good for this.

48:55.100 --> 48:58.360
- Just calm, no high power, okay?

48:58.360 --> 48:59.887
Don't worry about me, okay?

48:59.887 --> 49:02.160
You just worry about you.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.573
And why do you care anyway?

49:04.520 --> 49:05.453
You care about me?

49:06.940 --> 49:07.780
- Since I've been here,

49:07.780 --> 49:10.720
you've been the one that's
been looking out for me.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.663
You brought me new clothes,

49:12.663 --> 49:15.163
you even gave him some
music to tune this shit out.

49:17.098 --> 49:18.087
- I've a natural good heart.

49:20.010 --> 49:21.023
- I guess I do care.

49:26.350 --> 49:28.170
- Oh okay.

49:28.170 --> 49:29.988
I care about you too.

49:29.988 --> 49:31.653
So everything is fine.

49:40.730 --> 49:42.527
- What are you looking at?

49:46.599 --> 49:47.599
- Come here.

50:44.417 --> 50:45.883
All my life,

50:48.670 --> 50:50.763

50:54.830 --> 50:57.123
Trust issues, come and keep a distance.

50:58.780 --> 51:00.053
Worry about nobody.

51:07.010 --> 51:09.363
Trust issues, come and keep a distance.

51:12.690 --> 51:13.953
I be envious of nothing.

51:19.910 --> 51:23.000
Trust issues, come and keep a distance.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.327
Envious of nothing, I
don't see no competition.

51:29.537 --> 51:31.620
Don't see no competition.

51:32.649 --> 51:35.316
(hip hop music)

51:48.409 --> 51:50.180
- Hey bro, what's up with your homie?

51:50.180 --> 51:51.360
Why he never talk?

51:51.360 --> 51:54.980
- Yeah. Why he always wearing that mask?
