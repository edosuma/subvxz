WEBVTT

00:03.854 --> 00:06.671
Welcome to Avengers mansion,
your new home.

00:06.705 --> 00:08.590
Sounds good. [Grunts]

00:08.625 --> 00:11.167
So if we're home now,

00:11.202 --> 00:13.120
why do we have to wear
our action suits?

00:13.155 --> 00:15.622
Because we're Avengers 24-7.

00:15.657 --> 00:17.699
You all moved in, Vision?

00:17.734 --> 00:21.386
I have no possessions to move,
and this is my only suit.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.099
[beeping]

00:26.134 --> 00:28.860
Come on, Ant-Man.
You call that a uniform?

00:28.895 --> 00:31.262
Wait. Aren't you moving in too?

00:31.298 --> 00:34.149
Relax, Wasp. My movers
are already on the job.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.470
Ew!

00:38.505 --> 00:41.489
Black Panther, where do we
keep the bug spray?

00:41.525 --> 00:43.667
Hey, you do not
spray my pet ants.

00:43.702 --> 00:45.602
Especially the big one.

00:45.637 --> 00:47.145
What do you mean, "big one"?

00:47.181 --> 00:48.930
[gasps]

00:48.966 --> 00:52.075
No, no, no, no...
Uh-uh. No. Mm-mm. No.

00:52.111 --> 00:54.536
What? Anthony's house-trained.
[chittering]

00:54.571 --> 00:56.829
For the most part.

00:56.865 --> 00:58.907
The insects' hive mentality
is very efficient

00:58.942 --> 01:01.701
when completing
team-oriented tasks.

01:01.737 --> 01:05.831
The idea that you have taken an
ant as a companion intrigues me.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.108
Maybe we should get you
a calculator for a pet.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.426
A little version of you
to boss around.

01:10.462 --> 01:12.362
If you get a pet,
you have to take care of it.

01:12.397 --> 01:14.197
So, what, change the batteries?

01:14.232 --> 01:16.425
Baby steps here, Marvel.

01:16.460 --> 01:21.112
I meant her, Ms. Marvel.
Not you, Captain Marvel.

01:21.148 --> 01:24.774
By the way, whose idea was it to have two
heroes named Marvel on the same team?

01:24.810 --> 01:26.793
I picked my name
because of Captain Marvel.

01:26.828 --> 01:28.912
Yeah. It's confusing.

01:28.947 --> 01:30.647
â™ª [tune chiming
through speaker device]

01:30.682 --> 01:33.174
That is the Wakandan
national anthem,

01:33.209 --> 01:35.619
and also the door chime.

01:35.654 --> 01:38.129
But we are not expecting guests.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.864
Defense systems didn't trigger.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.466
Must be a friendly.

01:45.972 --> 01:48.432
Captain America! You're alive!

01:48.467 --> 01:51.193
What happened to you? Are the
rest of the Avengers with you?

01:51.228 --> 01:52.995
[Wasp] We thought you were dead.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.030
[grunts] [gasps]

01:56.374 --> 01:58.074
Vision, what are you doing?

01:58.110 --> 01:59.926
Stand clear.

01:59.961 --> 02:02.028
Captain America
must be destroyed.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:16.545 --> 02:18.895
Vision, stop!

02:18.930 --> 02:21.656
[grunting]

02:21.692 --> 02:22.799
[grunts]

02:25.129 --> 02:26.420
[Wasp] What? [Ms. Marvel] No!

02:26.455 --> 02:27.775
What have you done?
[Ant-Man] Cap!

02:29.683 --> 02:33.409
This isn't Captain America.
It's some kind of robot.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.763
And only Vision could see
through its disguise.

02:36.798 --> 02:38.448
Apologies, friend.

02:38.483 --> 02:42.101
I should have communicated
the danger.

02:42.137 --> 02:45.380
Perhaps I was too enthusiastic.
No. You did good.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.390
Always trash a robot
pretending to be a friend.

02:47.426 --> 02:49.610
Any idea what it is?

02:49.645 --> 02:51.678
It is a Red Skull-Bot,
obviously.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.313
Obviously.

02:53.348 --> 02:55.373
And how do we obviously
know this?

02:57.319 --> 02:59.018
[Black Panther]
Red Skull frequently

02:59.054 --> 03:02.330
uses doubles of himself
as decoys and bodyguards.

03:02.365 --> 03:05.350
This automaton was not armed or
equipped with explosive devices.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.428
So it wasn't set to attack us.

03:08.464 --> 03:10.972
Then why would
Red Skull send it?

03:11.007 --> 03:13.124
Once we hunt down Red Skull,
we'll get our answers,

03:13.160 --> 03:14.517
and some payback.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.563
[disgusted groan]

03:20.993 --> 03:23.026
Hydra-frequency comm device.

03:23.062 --> 03:24.903
Its transmissions can be traced.

03:29.151 --> 03:30.420
[beeping] [Black Panther] There.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.411
Satellite is picking up an
uncharted island, straight ahead.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.700
Skull Island. Ah, so cool!

03:38.735 --> 03:40.702
I bet it even looks
like a skull.

03:40.737 --> 03:42.229
[groans]

03:42.264 --> 03:44.656
Hey, where's Vision?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.758
He was back there
tinkering with that Skull-Bot.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.593
Thing's creepy, if you ask me.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.104
[German accent]
You were not asked, Avenger.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.364
[loud gasp]

03:52.399 --> 03:55.266
[grunts] [groans]

03:55.301 --> 03:58.061
Hold, friends.
This Skull-Bot means no harm.

03:58.096 --> 03:59.179
[both] Huh?

03:59.214 --> 04:01.323
As I repaired him,

04:01.358 --> 04:04.250
I decided he could be... my pet.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.234
[Black Panther, Ms.
Marvel, Wasp] Your pet?

04:05.270 --> 04:07.670
I will clean up after it.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.089
Makes sense. No, it doesn't.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.125
What if that thing
tries to kill us?

04:12.160 --> 04:15.436
Uh, yeah!
It's patterned after Red Skull.

04:15.472 --> 04:19.266
You know he's tried to destroy the
Avengers no less than eight times, right?

04:19.301 --> 04:22.602
I am aware of the threat, so I put
behavioral limits on Skully's programming.

04:22.637 --> 04:25.080
You named it Skully?

04:25.115 --> 04:27.949
I find that
designation offensive.

04:27.984 --> 04:30.368
I will see you all
meet your doom.

04:30.403 --> 04:33.996
Preferably a fiery
und painful one.

04:34.032 --> 04:36.892
Skully may talk like the Red Skull,
but he will not act like him.

04:36.927 --> 04:38.101
Can I keep him?

04:41.799 --> 04:44.733
[Ant-Man] Aw! That doesn't
look like a skull at all.

04:44.768 --> 04:47.386
So much for branding.
You sure this is the place?

04:47.421 --> 04:50.447
Skull's transmissions are
coming from these coordinates.

04:54.403 --> 04:56.336
[alarm beeping]

04:56.371 --> 04:59.364
Excellent. We have incoming.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.608
How is that a good thing?

05:01.643 --> 05:04.143
Because it means
this is definitely the place.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.712
Everybody hold on to something.

05:09.484 --> 05:11.509
That first wave
is coming around.

05:13.822 --> 05:15.262
Activating countermeasures.
[beeping]

05:18.051 --> 05:22.270
How about we use Red Skull's
tactics against him? You know?

05:22.305 --> 05:24.384
Skull impersonated one of our
friends to get in our house.

05:24.408 --> 05:26.182
Let's do it to him.
Make it happen.

05:26.217 --> 05:27.817
I'll buy us time.

05:29.254 --> 05:31.654
Oh, the indignity.

05:31.689 --> 05:34.090
My retribution will be
swift und terrible.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.851
[beeps]
Amplifying Skully's frequency,

05:36.886 --> 05:38.995
we should be scanned
as a friendly.

05:39.031 --> 05:40.374
[Captain Marvel]
We're out of time.

05:40.398 --> 05:41.398
[beeps]

05:42.467 --> 05:43.467
[beeping]

05:50.450 --> 05:51.891
Yeah! Way to go, Skully!

05:51.926 --> 05:54.435
Cease your celebrating!

05:54.470 --> 05:57.172
I did not have a choice.

05:57.207 --> 05:59.541
I reprogrammed you
to avoid evil,

05:59.576 --> 06:01.426
but you are not
a mindless slave.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.769
You always have a choice.

06:10.770 --> 06:15.123
[Ant-Man] At least it'll
make sneaking around easier.

06:15.159 --> 06:17.654
You can come with us, Skully, or
you can stay here and do nothing.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.785
It's your choice.

06:23.191 --> 06:25.917
Stay alert.
Be ready for anything.

06:30.949 --> 06:33.258
[Ant-Man] Okay. Wasn't
ready for nothing.

06:35.662 --> 06:39.013
I found something.

06:39.048 --> 06:42.850
[Wasp] Skully's brothers.
Hundreds of 'em.

06:42.885 --> 06:46.112
Insolent fools!
These are not my brothers.

06:46.147 --> 06:49.490
I have a higher
intelligence capacity.

06:49.525 --> 06:53.711
These are attack Sleepers that will
awaken only when summoned by Herr Skull.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.140
Speaking of, where is gruesome?

06:57.175 --> 07:00.835
Where he has been for some
time... the detention block.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.955
Come this way,
und meet your demise.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.335
[blow lands]

07:12.148 --> 07:14.532
Skully was on the level.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.135
Red Skull.
Locked in his own jail.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.098
It took you long enough, 627.

07:25.853 --> 07:28.046
Apologies, Herr Skull.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.732
But these Avengers are
worse than... Silence!

07:32.009 --> 07:34.085
[grunts]

07:34.121 --> 07:36.913
Avengers, release me
from this shell.

07:36.948 --> 07:39.048
There is no time to explain.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.567
Oh, we have a little time.

07:41.603 --> 07:45.805
The computer I built to
defend this base, Skull-Net,

07:45.840 --> 07:49.934
achieved sentience and falsely
calculated itself superior to me.

07:49.969 --> 07:53.704
Yeah, pretty humiliating to get
taken down by your own creation.

07:53.740 --> 07:58.401
Quite the contrary...
[grunts] Ant-Man.

07:58.437 --> 08:02.171
Skull-Net's evolution
is a testament to my genius.

08:02.207 --> 08:05.859
And even then,
I have outsmarted my creation.

08:05.894 --> 08:09.379
Skull-Net activated 627
to care for me,

08:09.414 --> 08:12.857
but I secretly reprogrammed it
to fetch you.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.876
Why would you think
we would break you out?

08:14.911 --> 08:17.412
Because you need me.

08:17.489 --> 08:21.875
To stop Skull-Net
from awakening my Sleeper army.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.035
[Skull-Net] Too late, master.

08:29.492 --> 08:31.284
[powering up]

08:31.319 --> 08:34.562
[multiple Skull-Bots
powering up]

08:34.597 --> 08:37.006
Skull-Net has
awakened the Sleepers

08:37.042 --> 08:39.174
to destroy the Avengers.

08:44.299 --> 08:46.758
[Sky-Net] Skull-drones, attack!

08:46.793 --> 08:49.126
Eye lasers? That's new.

08:49.162 --> 08:52.313
Why didn't your pet tell us they
could do that? We did not ask.

08:55.218 --> 08:57.711
[grunts]

08:57.746 --> 09:00.838
[yells] [yells]

09:00.874 --> 09:02.923
You'll never defeat them,
Avengers,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.351
unless you know their weakness,

09:05.386 --> 09:08.971
which I will provide
in exchange for my freedom.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.082
Ms. Marvel, grab him,
and let's go.

09:15.655 --> 09:17.463
I'll clear a path.

09:18.991 --> 09:20.500
[grunts]

09:20.535 --> 09:23.077
[yells]

09:23.113 --> 09:24.387
[grunting]

09:29.152 --> 09:32.278
[Red Skull] The Skull-Bots
cannot all be awakened at once.

09:32.314 --> 09:36.082
Prevent the majority from
activating, and you have a chance.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.910
Split up. Ant-Man,
Ms. Marvel, Wasp,

09:38.945 --> 09:40.961
take the ones not awake yet.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.989
We will put the others
back to sleep.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.620
[Black Panther yells]

09:48.655 --> 09:53.199
Because there weren't enough
things shooting at us. [Grunts]

09:53.234 --> 09:56.711
[grunting] Trying to sneak away?

10:01.351 --> 10:03.134
Gotcha! [Grunts]

10:06.298 --> 10:08.640
Skully, do not let him escape.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.016
Aah!

10:10.052 --> 10:12.710
Vision, are you sure about this?

10:12.745 --> 10:15.162
I trust him. You shouldn't.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.074
I would betray you
if my programming permitted it.

10:18.109 --> 10:20.009
He's just saying that.

10:20.045 --> 10:22.236
I am not! [Growls]

10:23.831 --> 10:25.615
[grunting]

10:25.650 --> 10:27.875
I can do this.

10:27.910 --> 10:30.036
[Ant-Man, Wasp grunting]

10:32.690 --> 10:34.648
I will deal with Skull-Net.

10:34.684 --> 10:38.119
[grunts]

10:38.154 --> 10:42.073
You and Skull-Net are more
alike than different, android.

10:42.108 --> 10:45.268
Tools created by man
but superior to him.

10:45.303 --> 10:48.571
Your claim of being superior
is a flaw.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.065
Building equal relationships
is more important.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.776
You took Skull-Bot 627
as a companion

10:53.811 --> 10:55.962
because he is like you.

10:55.997 --> 10:58.990
Unite with machine-kind.
We will prevail.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.718
One race with a single mind
and a single vision.

11:02.754 --> 11:04.937
Join us.

11:04.973 --> 11:07.740
You cannot force me
to join you, Skull-Net.

11:07.776 --> 11:09.734
Loyalty is earned by friendship.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.319
If you require friendship,

11:12.355 --> 11:14.539
you are irrelevant and will
be destroyed. [Grunts]

11:16.142 --> 11:18.418
[grunting]

11:22.990 --> 11:24.882
Everybody move!

11:26.869 --> 11:27.869
Skully!

11:37.672 --> 11:40.056
You must have
a faulty logic circuit

11:40.091 --> 11:42.708
to risk yourself saving me.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.703
This is what Avengers do...
Save others.

11:45.738 --> 11:47.964
How dare you lay your hands on...

11:47.999 --> 11:49.332
[screaming] Ow!

11:49.367 --> 11:51.809
Your pet needs to be quiet now.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.353
So much for Skull's
world destruction.

11:54.388 --> 11:56.739
I'm pretty sure
it was domination.

11:56.775 --> 11:58.791
[Ms. Marvel] No. He was
gonna wreck the world.

11:58.827 --> 12:01.410
[sighs] Settle a bet, Big Red.

12:01.446 --> 12:03.362
What were you going
to do with your army?

12:03.397 --> 12:05.673
Destroy the world,
or take it over?

12:05.708 --> 12:09.561
Take it over if I won,
destroy it if I lost.

12:09.596 --> 12:14.273
Unfortunately, your victory
over my army was necessary

12:14.308 --> 12:16.901
to slow down Skull-Net.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.070
What do you mean, "slow down"?

12:19.105 --> 12:21.555
Skull-Net still lives.

12:21.591 --> 12:24.725
You broke it here,
but the mainframe computer

12:24.761 --> 12:28.804
is in another location,
southwest of Paris.

12:28.839 --> 12:31.290
Oh, let me guess.
Castle Red Skull.

12:31.325 --> 12:33.751
Hydra Base Number 24.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.829
Ugh. You are so boring.

12:36.865 --> 12:39.224
Prisoner to the likes of you.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.127
This is humiliating.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.294
[angry groan]

12:45.873 --> 12:48.491
Skull-Net's mainframe
is within that tower.

12:48.526 --> 12:50.326
[Captain Marvel]
I think you hear me knockin'!

12:52.355 --> 12:55.456
This must be another Sleeper.

12:55.491 --> 12:58.025
One you would be wise
to keep from awakening.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.019
The mainframe is there.

13:00.055 --> 13:02.871
[Ms. Marvel] Whoa! Creepy junk.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.149
And we're here
to take out the trash.

13:07.754 --> 13:11.272
[Skull-Net] Defenses activate.
Skull-Bots attack.

13:11.307 --> 13:12.907
[Ant-Man] More Skull-Bots?

13:12.943 --> 13:14.492
I hope you bought these in bulk.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.203
[yells]

13:23.060 --> 13:25.586
[whirring] [timer beeping]

13:25.621 --> 13:29.548
Trying to pull a fast one
when we're not looking?

13:29.583 --> 13:31.776
[grunts] Not happening, Skull!
[grunts]

13:31.812 --> 13:35.547
The machines will rise
to overcome your kind.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.090
When the countdown reaches zero,

13:38.126 --> 13:39.670
[beeping continues]
the Sleeper will awaken.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.161
Not today. [Grunts]

13:42.197 --> 13:46.073
[grunts] Panther, take
Skull-Net offline. [Yells]

13:46.108 --> 13:48.568
[distorted] System failure...

13:51.547 --> 13:54.348
And down goes Skull-Net.

13:54.383 --> 13:55.975
You owe us big, Red Skull.

13:56.011 --> 13:57.184
[grunts] [thud]

13:57.219 --> 13:59.070
[Red Skull] Indeed, I do.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.481
Now with Skull-Net offline,

14:01.516 --> 14:04.250
there is only one left
to command my Sleepers...

14:04.285 --> 14:06.168
Me!

14:22.153 --> 14:24.770
You won't find these Sleepers
so easy to stop.

14:27.792 --> 14:30.610
[Ant-Man]
Wait. Did he say "Sleepers"?

14:30.645 --> 14:32.605
Plural? Like, more than one?
[thunderous footstep]

14:36.325 --> 14:38.117
[thunderous footstep]

14:41.906 --> 14:45.767
[Red Skull] Omega Skulls,
destroy the Avengers!

14:45.802 --> 14:47.668
[sinister laughter]

14:50.681 --> 14:54.325
[Red Skull] Earth's mightiest
heroes are dead and buried.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.588
Now follow me, Omega Skulls.

14:58.623 --> 15:01.891
My revenge has only begun.

15:05.747 --> 15:07.438
[grunts]

15:11.168 --> 15:14.278
My creator has
outsmarted you... again.

15:14.313 --> 15:18.640
Your creator left you here to be destroyed.
Don't you care?

15:18.676 --> 15:20.742
It is his nature.

15:20.778 --> 15:24.271
I am merely a Skull-Bot.

15:24.307 --> 15:27.211
Thought you said you had a higher
intelligence capacity than your brothers.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.760
Vision, get us a location
on the Red Skull.

15:29.796 --> 15:34.465
[Vision] The three Omega Skull-Bots
are converging on Paris.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.792
[Wasp] Then so are we.

15:36.827 --> 15:39.395
Come on, Skully! [Yells]

15:39.397 --> 15:41.655
[Captain Marvel] We're the
last line of defense.

15:41.691 --> 15:42.851
Can't let him reach the city.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.809
[grunts]

15:52.844 --> 15:55.678
Vision!
He might have been damaged!

15:55.713 --> 15:57.153
Wow. I think
you're starting to care.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.744
We're in trouble.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.028
[Vision]
Emergency exit, at your service.

16:17.668 --> 16:18.992
[thud] [grunts]

16:19.028 --> 16:21.954
[grunting]

16:21.990 --> 16:24.331
[grunts]

16:24.367 --> 16:26.333
[grunts]

16:26.369 --> 16:27.577
[yells]

16:27.612 --> 16:29.770
Panther! [Grunts]

16:31.950 --> 16:34.300
They don't build 'em
like that anymore.

16:34.335 --> 16:36.610
Won't be easy to stop.
We do not have a choice.

16:41.767 --> 16:42.767
[grunts]

16:46.606 --> 16:49.882
Well, that didn't work.
Got any other ideas?

16:49.959 --> 16:53.377
No, but we have to come up
with something, and quick!

16:59.468 --> 17:02.770
We need to find a way
to hack that robot.

17:02.805 --> 17:05.955
Despite its enhanced weapons, the Omega
is structurally similar in design

17:05.991 --> 17:08.157
to Skull's smaller doubles.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.127
It may share any design flaws.
Skully?

17:11.163 --> 17:13.146
Our design is without flaw.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.142
Oh, fine.

17:17.178 --> 17:19.895
The arm and leg joints
require additional maintenance.

17:19.930 --> 17:22.146
Arthritis! Yes! [Grunts]

17:22.182 --> 17:24.125
[grunts]

17:24.160 --> 17:27.194
You are a traitor, number 627.

17:27.230 --> 17:30.348
You were my servant,
my creation,

17:30.383 --> 17:32.900
yet you betrayed me.

17:32.935 --> 17:35.244
I helped those who helped me.

17:35.279 --> 17:37.146
You never gave me a choice.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.056
Vision did.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.300
Spare me
your sentimental drivel.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.067
Ugh!

17:50.102 --> 17:52.294
Avengers, we have
a Skull-Bot weakness.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.105
Go for the joints.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.007
[grunts]

17:57.043 --> 17:58.043
[grunts]

18:01.531 --> 18:03.981
[straining]

18:04.016 --> 18:06.242
[grunts]

18:11.632 --> 18:13.474
I think that worked.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.867
[creaking]

18:15.903 --> 18:18.162
This joint-weakness thing
isn't doing it!

18:18.197 --> 18:20.381
Whoa! [Grunts]

18:23.436 --> 18:26.637
I have an idea.
Keep it shooting at you.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.705
Wait. What kind of plan is that?

18:28.741 --> 18:29.741
[grunts]

18:32.836 --> 18:34.220
[grunts]

18:34.255 --> 18:36.530
Okay, it's shooting at me!

18:36.565 --> 18:38.274
And it's still shooting at me!

18:39.910 --> 18:42.611
[grunts] Sabotage!

18:47.309 --> 18:48.309
[crash]

18:48.344 --> 18:50.185
Nice plan.

18:50.220 --> 18:51.700
[Red Skull]
You're too late, Avengers.

18:53.799 --> 18:57.685
[Ant-Man] Uh-oh.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.001
[Vision] They appear to be
consolidating their generators.

19:01.665 --> 19:04.533
Sensors indicate the generators
in his Omega Sleepers

19:04.568 --> 19:07.620
are going to release
an electromagnetic pulse.

19:07.655 --> 19:10.397
I calculate his EMP will
destroy any electrical system

19:10.432 --> 19:12.366
within 4,000 kilometers.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.701
Including you and I.

19:14.737 --> 19:18.673
Behold my instrument of revenge.

19:18.708 --> 19:23.444
If Hydra cannot have Paris, no one can.
[beeping]

19:23.479 --> 19:25.340
The generators will overload
in less than a minute.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.757
If that happens, the blast
will trap Red Skull too.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.117
Unless...

19:32.288 --> 19:33.895
he bugs out.

19:33.931 --> 19:36.741
Break that shield!

19:36.776 --> 19:39.919
You will fail if you attempt it.

19:39.954 --> 19:42.721
Only another Skull-Bot
might get through the shield.

19:42.757 --> 19:47.176
Only... me.

19:47.211 --> 19:50.896
Would that work? [Wasp] If Skully
disrupts the charge-up, it might.

19:50.931 --> 19:53.407
To stop the detonation protocol,

19:53.443 --> 19:56.719
you would have to insert
yourself into the circuit.

19:56.754 --> 19:59.104
Your form would not survive.

19:59.140 --> 20:01.214
You said I had a choice.

20:01.250 --> 20:03.025
I choose to do it.

20:08.474 --> 20:13.410
Number 627, you are no pet.
You are my friend.

20:15.523 --> 20:18.899
Remember me... as Skully.

20:18.935 --> 20:20.334
Good-bye, Skully.

20:22.571 --> 20:24.221
Aahh!

20:24.257 --> 20:26.757
[screaming]

20:36.944 --> 20:39.603
[beeping]

20:42.424 --> 20:43.424
[growls]

20:45.111 --> 20:47.861
They could not have... Huh?
[knocking on window]

20:49.982 --> 20:51.490
Mm.

20:55.412 --> 20:56.912
What are you looking at?

21:07.449 --> 21:11.352
Gotta hand it to you, T'Challa. This
is some good Avengers HQ right here.

21:11.387 --> 21:13.395
I am glad you feel welcome,

21:13.430 --> 21:16.148
and that everything
is back to normal.

21:16.183 --> 21:19.075
It's not for all of us.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.729
Aw. Poor guy misses Skully.

21:22.764 --> 21:25.574
[Ant-Man sighs]
Losing a pet is the worst.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.768
But the good memories stay
with you forever. [Chittering]

21:28.804 --> 21:36.804
I get the feeling
Vision's gonna be okay.
