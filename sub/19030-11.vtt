WEBVTT

00:01.768 --> 00:05.795
Say, Zeltzer, my family is with
me here today but all the tables are full.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.101
Do you mind
if we join you for breakfast?

00:07.140 --> 00:09.165
Oh, not at all. I get family.

00:09.209 --> 00:12.303
I'm here so much,
I hardly ever see my wife.

00:12.345 --> 00:15.041
And that's why I installed
a Web camera at my house.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.174
That way, I can see her during the day.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.412
Right now I'm watching her
do the Dishes.

00:19.452 --> 00:21.579
Who in God's name
are those two naked people?

00:21.621 --> 00:23.782
That's Mr. And Mrs. Dish.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.085
Get out.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.991
- Hi, puppy.
- FYI,

00:29.029 --> 00:31.759
I fired the cashier and the person
that made the scrambled eggs.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.595
Their accents were unintelligible.

00:33.633 --> 00:34.725
What're you talking about?

00:34.768 --> 00:37.566
Oh, it's one of the benefits
of you being the Chief of Medicine.

00:37.604 --> 00:41.734
I can fire people under your auspices.
Also, I didn't have to pay for food.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.675
I got three steaks!

00:44.944 --> 00:46.571
Jordan, that's...

00:46.613 --> 00:51.209
Give me one of these.
Why isn't he in pre-school right now?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.978
Oh, 'cause he told me
they have the day off for Yom Kippur.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.545
Yom Kippur was six months ago.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.216
I hate school!

00:58.258 --> 01:00.351
Never been more proud of you.

01:00.393 --> 01:04.625
It's the password to my Web cam.
I think you're gonna dig it.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.767
- Oh, babe, you got a little smudge there.
- Uh-oh.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.294
What is that, strawberry jam?

01:12.338 --> 01:14.272
Nah, just a little blood from shaving.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.968
Oh, sweetie.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.977
Oh, don't worry, I wasn't shaving myself.

01:18.278 --> 01:21.839
Say, Jack, don't you think your mom
should be just a little embarrassed

01:21.881 --> 01:24.975
that she's constantly being outwitted
by a four-year-old?

01:25.018 --> 01:26.781
I hate school!

01:26.820 --> 01:27.980
I remember.

01:28.021 --> 01:31.422
Can you please not be a jackass
in front of the help?

01:32.392 --> 01:34.792
- I'm gonna get going.
- Okay. We're still on for tonight, right?

01:34.828 --> 01:36.318
I'll answer that with this.

01:36.362 --> 01:38.887
I don't know
what that means.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.490
You're so cute.

01:41.634 --> 01:43.932
I'm actually baffled.
Am I gonna see her tonight or not?

01:43.970 --> 01:47.872
Was either one of us giving you a vibe
that we give a crap?

01:47.907 --> 01:51.172
Because, if so,
that's an accident and we're sorry.

01:51.211 --> 01:52.371
Apology accepted.

01:52.412 --> 01:54.607
And you know,
just because Lady and I are clicking

01:54.647 --> 01:56.376
and you guys aren't
doesn't matter, really.

01:56.416 --> 01:57.883
Just means we're a better couple.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.784
No, I'm just tired of him saying
I'm not a good parent.

02:00.820 --> 02:02.378
I am a great mom.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.982
Oh, really?
Then where's your son, Jack?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.253
Hmm.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.096
Damn it. Jack!

02:15.001 --> 02:17.469
<i>This is</i> SportsCenter.

02:17.837 --> 02:19.270
<i>After Buffalo Bills tight end</i>

02:19.305 --> 02:22.001
<i>Kevin Everett fractured</i>
<i>his cervical spine during a game,</i>

02:22.041 --> 02:24.509
<i>the question wasn't</i>
<i>whether he would ever walk again.</i>

02:24.544 --> 02:25.977
<i>It was whether he would live.</i>

02:26.012 --> 02:29.379
<i>Thankfully, Mr. Everett</i>
<i>both alive and walking today,</i>

02:29.415 --> 02:33.374
<i>thanks to an incredibly risky</i>
<i>medical procedure called cold therapy.</i>

02:33.419 --> 02:35.819
<i>It's as unproven as it is controversial,</i>

02:35.855 --> 02:39.256
<i>with doctors still disagreeing</i>
<i>about its very effectiveness.</i>

02:39.292 --> 02:41.055
Turk, if we have another baby

02:41.094 --> 02:42.994
- it'll still be pretty financially tight.
- Mmm-hmm.

02:43.029 --> 02:45.497
'Cause we're gonna need
to keep the nanny on for Izzy.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.397
Are you even listening to me?

02:47.433 --> 02:49.526
I'm not, baby,
but I was pretending to listen

02:49.569 --> 02:51.594
and so I think we can both agree
that means I love you.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.766
Turk, this is serious.
I worry about this stuff.

02:54.807 --> 02:57.708
Baby, the only thing I'm worried about
is you having another girl.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.644
- I'm surrounded by girls.
- Surrounded?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.340
Yes. Surrounded by girls.

03:01.381 --> 03:04.942
- Baby, you, Izzy, Elliot.
- Who else?

03:04.984 --> 03:06.246
Hey.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.380
What's that laugh about?
That laugh is never good for me.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.891
- You're a girl.
- No, I'm not.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.952
- What's this show? Is it new?
- It's <i>SportsCenter,</i> dude.

03:17.597 --> 03:22.034
If you must do that witch cackle
can you please do it in the hallway?

03:22.068 --> 03:23.433
Thank you.

03:25.171 --> 03:28.004
I've been watching this show every day
since I was 10 years old.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.566
<i>You know, we've asked you,</i>
<i>among many things today,</i>

03:30.610 --> 03:32.669
<i>how do you feel about the baseball,</i>
<i>the football, the...</i>

03:32.712 --> 03:35.647
So they just sit there
and talk about sports?

03:36.849 --> 03:38.441
- Your wife's a dirty whore.
- Dude!

03:38.484 --> 03:39.781
- Sorry. Not dirty.
- Dude!

03:39.819 --> 03:41.343
Not a whore.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.787
How cool would it be
to be on <i>SportsCenter?</i>

03:45.091 --> 03:48.788
<i>Welcome to</i> SportsCenter.
<i>America has voted. The results are in.</i>

03:48.828 --> 03:52.628
<i>And the worst athlete in the world?</i>
<i>It's this guy right here.</i>

03:53.099 --> 03:55.829
<i>I like wearing a helmet,</i>
<i>'cause I can do this.</i>

03:56.903 --> 03:59.064
<i>And it only hurts a little bit.</i>

03:59.105 --> 04:01.403
<i>Congratulations, John Dorian.</i>

04:01.441 --> 04:03.841
<i>You are a giant nerd.</i>

04:04.577 --> 04:05.839
So cool.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.879
<i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

04:10.116 --> 04:11.606
<i>No, I know</i>

04:11.651 --> 04:13.585
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:16.856 --> 04:18.447
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

04:21.494 --> 04:23.826
<i>J.D.: It's amazing watching Turk</i>
<i>do his thing.</i>

04:23.863 --> 04:25.797
I haven't been to the future yet,

04:25.832 --> 04:27.857
but I may be the best surgeon
of all time.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.128
Close him up.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.330
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah!

04:34.207 --> 04:35.265
What're you doing?

04:35.308 --> 04:37.606
You were awesome.
Just like on <i>SportsCenter.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:39.942
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah!

04:40.513 --> 04:42.708
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah!

04:42.749 --> 04:43.943
I know, that's what I did.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.644
Nah, nah nah nah, nah nah nah?

04:45.685 --> 04:47.778
Nah nah nah, nah...

04:47.820 --> 04:49.048
No, hold on a second.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.282
Doe, a deer.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.188
No, it's doe, it's a deer.

04:52.225 --> 04:55.023
J.D., now is not a good time, okay?

04:55.895 --> 04:57.658
That kid broke his neck.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.461
- I want to thank you for dinner last night.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:03.503 --> 05:06.370
I've eaten by candlelight before,
but never by firefly-light.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.101
Yeah, it was hard
to get them all in the jugs,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.369
- but I thought it was worth it.
- Oh.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.001
So, what do you want to do tonight?

05:11.044 --> 05:14.605
Um, I don't really want to hold hands
right now. Is that okay?

05:15.114 --> 05:18.413
Sure. You know, that's...
I'm fine with that. Whatever.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.618
Like teenage girls say, "Whatever."

05:21.654 --> 05:23.519
We're cool.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.352
Okay. I'll call you.

05:26.726 --> 05:27.818
Okay.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.557
Hey, Janitor.
Rock-solid relationship there.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.134
You know, there's nothing like
looking in someone's eyes

05:35.168 --> 05:37.466
and seeing a part of them die.

05:39.672 --> 05:44.541
Oh, there it goes! Bye-bye, hope.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.941
Everything is fine
between me and Lady.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.708
And excuse me for not having
a relationship

05:48.748 --> 05:51.478
built on a mutual affection
for jet-black hate.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.314
We don't hate each other, do we?

05:53.353 --> 05:56.049
- A little bit, but we make it work.
- Yeah.

05:56.122 --> 05:59.182
- At least I can hold your hand.
- There it is.

05:59.225 --> 06:00.692
What's this?

06:00.727 --> 06:03.287
What the hell?
Are you wearing a wedding ring?

06:03.329 --> 06:07.322
You just noticing that now?
He's been wearing it for months.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.801
- Months?
- Got to go.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.132
I'm a cutter.

06:17.176 --> 06:22.170
I usually say "surgery went great"
or "he's not gonna make it, I'm sorry."

06:23.416 --> 06:27.147
I've never had to tell anyone
that their son's gonna be paralyzed.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.881
That's gonna suck.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.549
I wish there was an easier way
to say this.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.258
Mr. Hill?

06:36.729 --> 06:38.629
Got you a card.

06:40.199 --> 06:43.066
"Great to see you, great to talk.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.601
"The bad news is,
your son can't walk."

06:49.142 --> 06:53.704
And see, there's a picture
of a kitty cat in a wheelchair.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.270
Look at the cat.

06:55.314 --> 06:58.215
He's shrugging, like,
"What are you gonna do?"

06:58.251 --> 07:00.685
"What are you..."
We did it at the same time!

07:03.122 --> 07:05.317
Dude. Was the daydream helpful?

07:05.358 --> 07:06.484
Not especially.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.324
I need you to focus.
You're better at this than I am.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.693
Here's what you're gonna do.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.722
You're gonna go in there, and
you're going to be completely honest.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.097
That's all you've got?

07:15.134 --> 07:17.068
Because I've been a doctor
for more than 10 minutes.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.661
Try not to get too emotional.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.763
If you feel yourself starting to cry,
do what I do

07:20.807 --> 07:24.334
and think of that gopher at the end
of <i>Caddyshack</i> when he dances.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.342
Got it.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.574
And, Turk, most importantly,

07:29.382 --> 07:31.976
don't give him any false hope.
You know?

07:32.018 --> 07:34.350
If you go in there
and make him think for a second

07:34.387 --> 07:36.218
there could be a happy ending for him,

07:36.255 --> 07:39.156
if it doesn't work out,
they're gonna blame you forever.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.956
I did that. You remember,
with my patient Mr. Chazznini?

07:41.994 --> 07:44.428
I think about it every day. Good luck.

07:45.731 --> 07:47.824
- Mr. Hill?
- Yes?

07:48.100 --> 07:52.093
I'm Dr. Christopher Turk.
I need to talk to you about your son.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.872
Miss Jensen, your brain CT came back
and as you can see,

07:58.911 --> 08:00.606
we were able to get all of the tumor.

08:00.646 --> 08:04.912
Unfortunately, we were not able
to remove this.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.412
That's the song
that's been stuck in your head.

08:08.454 --> 08:11.014
- Oh, Dr. Cox.
- Hey.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.520
What gives with you wearing that thing
on your finger?

08:14.560 --> 08:19.395
It's mainly to deter cougars like
Mrs. Jensen here from hitting on me,

08:19.432 --> 08:22.026
but it doesn't seem
to have stopped you, does it?

08:24.203 --> 08:25.761
What's the real reason?

08:25.805 --> 08:28.968
Oh, I don't know. Lately I've been feeling
warm and fuzzy about the kids,

08:29.008 --> 08:31.943
a little less nauseous about you,
and then I found this thing stuck

08:31.978 --> 08:34.071
to an old piece of gum
in the medicine cabinet.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.673
I put it on a couple of months ago
and I haven't taken it off since.

08:36.716 --> 08:39.684
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
Perry, we're not married.

08:39.719 --> 08:42.984
We're two independent people
who enjoy each other's company

08:43.022 --> 08:46.822
and are perfectly happy.
We're the opposite of married.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.827
- I don't want you to wear it anymore.
- Fine.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.886
Fine, what do you say I melt it down
into a bullet

08:50.930 --> 08:52.830
- and shoot myself with it?
- Thank you.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.930
Holding hands isn't so hard,
is it?

08:57.970 --> 09:00.234
I think there's something wrong
between me and Lady.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.764
Dibs. Who's Lady?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.177
Apparently she's not a fan
of hand-holding.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.112
And that's what couples do.
That and sleep head-to-toe.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.273
I'm just not sure she's the one.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.213
Zeltzer, when were you sure
your wife was the one?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.653
It was our fourth date, over at her place.

09:16.689 --> 09:20.318
We were sitting by the fire,
just staring into each other's eyes.

09:20.359 --> 09:23.192
I knew then and there
that she was the one.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.323
I would've told her
but I had a rubber ball in my mouth.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.628
I've just been Zeltzer-ed.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.202
Mr. Hill.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.501
It's Rich.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.236
Okay, Rich. Um, here's the situation.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.238
Your son's stable,
his vitals are good.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.439
But the damage to his spine
was quite severe.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.643
So there's a strong possibility
that he could...

09:45.685 --> 09:50.145
He really loved that car.
The one he had the accident in.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.216
He was always cleaning it.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.588
Driving it around with the top down.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.022
Okay. Um.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.099
Rich, the problem
with spinal cord injuries...

10:02.134 --> 10:04.432
Do you have any kids, Dr. Turk?

10:05.304 --> 10:08.205
Yeah. I do. I've got a daughter.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.099
They grow up fast.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.004
You know, when Mikey was twelve,
he was a hell of a football player.

10:15.414 --> 10:18.349
Rich, I'm trying to talk to you
about your son.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.978
- Here's...
- Yeah.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.544
I know you're trying to talk to me
about my son.

10:24.590 --> 10:28.492
When they brought Mike in, I saw them
poking at his fingers and toes,

10:28.527 --> 10:30.392
asking if he felt it.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.932
Dr. Turk, I have a pit in my stomach
because I'm afraid

10:34.967 --> 10:38.835
you've come here to tell me
my boy is going to be paralyzed.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.596
Tell me it isn't true.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.132
We're not exactly certain of that yet.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.479
You're his doctor. What do you think?

10:49.882 --> 10:52.350
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.149
Listen, something just really funny
jumped into my head.

10:55.187 --> 10:56.814
What? Tell me.

10:57.556 --> 11:01.117
You remember when the gopher started
dancing at the end of <i>Caddyshack?</i>

11:01.160 --> 11:03.958
J.D.: Oh, don't do the dance, Turk.
Don't do the dance.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.021
Carla, your husband's
not doing very well in there.

11:06.065 --> 11:08.533
I can't watch right now, I'm working.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.263
You know, if I was married to him
I'd be more supportive.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.737
You know you said that out loud, right?

11:13.773 --> 11:15.741
I'm not ashamed of who I am.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.904
And there's a 90% chance
that the gopher was a puppet, but

11:18.944 --> 11:21.640
this right here, hilarious.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.440
Dr. Turk, what the hell are we doing?

11:24.483 --> 11:26.007
I don't know.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.418
Rich, there's a strong possibility

11:30.456 --> 11:33.118
that your son will be paralyzed
from the neck down.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.786
This isn't fair.

11:35.761 --> 11:37.353
I'm so sorry.

11:37.663 --> 11:43.067
Please tell me there's something else
that you can do for my son. Anything.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.800
Don't give up on Mike. Please.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.240
<i>J.D.: There's a lot a person can</i>
<i>express, simply with their hands.</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:57.773
<i>Whether it's defiance...</i>

11:58.451 --> 11:59.975
What the hell?

12:01.187 --> 12:02.552
<i>J.D.: Rejection...</i>

12:03.656 --> 12:05.886
Oh, I said I didn't want to do that.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.186
Why?

12:09.028 --> 12:11.656
We can talk about it later, okay?

12:16.135 --> 12:19.536
Looks like somebody's
getting their ass dumped.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.504
<i>J.D.: Or even desperation.</i>

12:24.443 --> 12:27.901
Please, Dr. Turk. Please help.

12:32.051 --> 12:35.179
Don't do it, Turk.
No false hope. Just get out.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.390
There might be something I can do.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.230
Okay. Okay. Okay.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.365
J.D.: Uh, Dr. Turk, a word, please?

12:55.407 --> 12:58.570
I'm sorry, sir.
One of your patients is very...

12:59.478 --> 13:01.207
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?

13:01.247 --> 13:03.374
Don't you remember
my "don't give him false hope" speech

13:03.415 --> 13:05.610
and my lie about
how I had done it with Mr. Chazznini?

13:05.651 --> 13:07.619
- That was a lie?
- Yes, Turk.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.952
I lie to drive my points home,
we both know that about me.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.958
Look, I actually have a good idea.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.597
Mr. Hill, there's a therapy
I'd like to try on Mike.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.830
But here's the thing,
it's very experimental...

13:23.869 --> 13:25.427
I don't care. We're in.

13:25.471 --> 13:28.929
It's not up to me to make the decision.
I have to talk to my boss.

13:29.074 --> 13:30.302
Okay.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.373
Baby. I need to run something by you.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.848
Are you trying to annoy me
by wearing your wedding ring?

13:42.888 --> 13:45.721
Because all you really needed to do
was wear the "Who Farted?" T-shirt.

13:45.758 --> 13:49.717
Now, Hun, and when I say "Hun"
I don't mean the "short for honey" kind,

13:49.762 --> 13:52.162
but rather the "Attila" kind,

13:52.731 --> 13:55.291
despite the fact
that wearing our wedding ring

13:55.334 --> 13:57.928
may actually annoy you,
which, don't get me wrong,

13:57.970 --> 14:00.404
is one of the most stupendous perks
in the history of the planet,

14:00.439 --> 14:04.000
the truth is,
I'm wearing it because I want to.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.306
So that's it.
You're just going to ignore me?

14:06.345 --> 14:08.643
As much as I'll ignore the opening

14:08.681 --> 14:11.650
of Hugh Jackman's
next cinematic excretion.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.347
Jordan, come on, bottom line, I'm not
telling anyone that we're married.

14:15.387 --> 14:18.652
This isn't for other people, it's for me.

14:18.891 --> 14:22.725
Which begs the question,
why on Earth would you care?

14:28.934 --> 14:31.835
She can't break up with me
if I don't let her talk to me.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.133
<i>J.D.: I don't know what was odder,</i>

14:33.172 --> 14:35.333
<i>the Janitor spouting</i>
<i>random non sequiturs</i>

14:35.374 --> 14:38.241
<i>or Dr. Kelso doing</i>
<i>his daily post-muffin power walk</i>

14:38.277 --> 14:40.040
<i>and rubbing in the fact</i>
<i>that he's retired.</i>

14:40.079 --> 14:42.274
Must suck to be you people.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.443
Baby, it's a long shot,

14:44.483 --> 14:47.646
but there's a procedure
I heard of called cold therapy.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.655
We'd induce a mild hypothermia,
which would minimize swelling

14:50.689 --> 14:53.317
and hopefully reduce
the body's metabolic demand,

14:53.359 --> 14:55.190
preventing his paralysis.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.218
Hey. Do you have a second?

14:57.263 --> 15:01.290
Oh. Honey, I would love to, but I'm just
right in the middle of something.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.166
Anyway, between
the weak American dollar and the,

15:04.203 --> 15:06.262
you know, low interest rates,
I think you'd be absolute fools

15:06.305 --> 15:08.330
not to buy a house right now.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.842
And the subprime
mortgage foreclosures

15:10.876 --> 15:13.276
have just made it
a complete buyer's market.

15:13.812 --> 15:18.272
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but it kind of made sense.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.611
Look, the problem with cold therapy
is that it's controversial.

15:22.655 --> 15:26.284
Bottom line, if there are
any complications, it's on me.

15:27.159 --> 15:31.789
I could get sued, lose my license...
Hell, baby, we could lose everything.

15:31.830 --> 15:35.027
- The car, the college fund, the house...
- What house?

15:35.067 --> 15:37.797
- The one the Janitor was talking about.
- No!

15:37.836 --> 15:39.235
What am I supposed to do?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.796
What would you do
if it was one of our kids?

15:41.840 --> 15:43.569
I'd try everything.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.167
There's your answer.

15:46.578 --> 15:49.069
- Say it.
- You're always right.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.918
Well, you were right.
Lady and I are doomed.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.614
Congratulations, Pam.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.622
You think my name is Pam?

15:57.656 --> 15:59.783
You know what, I don't care.
I have my own problems.

15:59.825 --> 16:02.555
The worst part is, things were
really going great between us.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.789
Tell me about it.
Perry and I finally got to the place

16:04.830 --> 16:06.821
where we could have sex
facing each other.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.891
I finally got so comfortable with her that
I was able to be the real me, you know?

16:09.935 --> 16:11.960
I even told her
I don't ever want to have kids.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.700
I just want to adopt
a really short, old guy.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.138
You know what? If she wants
to break up with me, that's fine.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.507
But I'm just gonna dump her first.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.240
I'm going to torture him
till he gives up that ring.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.415
Hey. Eavesdropping.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.442
Things have been going so great
between J.D. And I

16:27.486 --> 16:30.114
since we started dating again.
You want to know why?

16:30.155 --> 16:31.554
Not really.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.218
No one cares
that you two are back together.

16:34.259 --> 16:35.385
Why not?

16:35.427 --> 16:38.658
Because you've been doing it
on and off for seven years.

16:38.697 --> 16:42.224
And if any one of us ever want to have
another stupid conversation

16:42.267 --> 16:45.168
about your relationship,
all we have to do is

16:45.204 --> 16:48.867
think back and remember
one of the other billions

16:48.907 --> 16:52.206
of stupid conversations
we've all had about your relationship.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.377
<i>J.D.: So, Turk,</i>
<i>this Elliot chick is pretty hot.</i>

16:56.415 --> 16:58.007
<i>She got nice boobies?</i>

16:58.050 --> 16:59.642
<i>J.D.: Awesome boobies.</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:00.777
<i>So how's the butt?</i>

17:00.819 --> 17:02.719
<i>J.D.: Flat, just like I like it.</i>

17:02.755 --> 17:04.154
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

17:04.189 --> 17:06.281
<i>J.D. 's gonna hit that flat butt!</i>

17:06.325 --> 17:11.194
<i>J.D. 's gonna hit that flat butt!</i>
<i>J.D. 's gonna hit that flat butt! J. D...</i>

17:12.664 --> 17:15.895
I was just thinking about
the first time I told Turk about you.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.869
Look, you guys both said
that you've been happy lately.

17:20.906 --> 17:22.703
Why mess that up over a ring?

17:22.741 --> 17:26.040
And why throw all of that away
before you even talk to Lady?

17:26.078 --> 17:27.339
Seeing as
that I'm part of a couple again,

17:27.378 --> 17:28.778
I'm gonna give you
some relationship advice,

17:28.814 --> 17:30.111
whether you want it or not.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.208
That's what I do. I can't help myself.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.219
Still, don't tear things apart

17:34.253 --> 17:36.915
just because you're afraid
to feel vulnerable.

17:37.356 --> 17:38.550
Hmm.

17:39.291 --> 17:43.193
Oh, lookit! You're adorable.
Do you got a daddy?

17:45.464 --> 17:47.125
I'm just window-shopping.

17:48.267 --> 17:49.859
Okay, Rich.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.462
Mike's hooked up
to the thermal regulation system,

17:52.504 --> 17:54.631
his body's now cooling.

17:54.673 --> 17:56.641
All we can do is wait
and hope for the best.

17:56.675 --> 17:59.542
I feel really good about this, you know?

18:03.282 --> 18:05.147
That makes one of us.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.579
Baby, what am I doing?

18:07.619 --> 18:09.086
I am proud of you.

18:09.121 --> 18:12.852
Not just for being smart,
but for being brave. Kiss.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.160
Where'd you get the idea
for this risky therapy, anyway?

18:19.465 --> 18:20.830
<i>SportsCenter.</i>

18:20.866 --> 18:22.128
Excuse me?

18:22.167 --> 18:26.365
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah!
<i>SportsCenter,</i> the place for sports!

18:27.372 --> 18:29.169
- Now's not really a good time.
- Okay.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.737
- We should talk.
- We should talk.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.541
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I know. Okay. Sorry about that.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.673
- Yeah.
- But, you go.

18:36.715 --> 18:38.307
Oh, no, no, no, you first.

18:38.350 --> 18:40.818
- I'd prefer you.
- No, no. You go first.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.878
I have nothing to say. Please go.

18:42.921 --> 18:45.151
- Okay...
- May I?

18:45.457 --> 18:49.416
I'm not really good
at the talking part of relationships,

18:49.461 --> 18:53.830
but I've given this a little thought,
and here goes.

18:54.766 --> 18:57.758
- Lf I were a catfish... See, that's no good.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.134
Catfish is no good.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.729
Let's pretend we're in Africa,

19:00.772 --> 19:03.468
and you're a monkey
trying to steal my gold...

19:03.509 --> 19:05.272
I'm a germaphobe.

19:05.944 --> 19:06.968
What?

19:07.012 --> 19:09.503
The reason I don't want to hold hands
is that I'm a germaphobe.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.948
Specifically,
a hand-specific germaphobe.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.008
Hmm.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.713
My therapist thinks
that part of reason I'm attracted to you

19:15.754 --> 19:17.915
is that you clean germs for a living.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.322
And you're a dead ringer for my dad.
Whatever. Anyway.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.659
Look, uh,
I've never told anyone this before,

19:24.696 --> 19:27.597
and I just finally
feel so comfortable with you

19:27.633 --> 19:30.363
that I want to be the real me,
you know?

19:31.537 --> 19:32.663
I do.

19:33.939 --> 19:35.907
- You're weird.
- Yeah.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.140
I love that.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.938
- Really?
- Yes.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.573
Mmm. Hey, don't touch the table,
it's full of bacteria.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.105
Oh. Thanks.

19:47.986 --> 19:51.478
Well, that sucked.
See you tomorrow, everybody.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.213
Bye, Bob!

19:54.059 --> 19:56.118
They're so cute.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.087
But I still think
that we're the best couple here.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.428
No one cares, Elliot.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.933
J.D., you're in the relationship,
you have to care!

20:02.968 --> 20:04.663
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.870
Look, you know what I love
about where we are now?

20:07.906 --> 20:08.964
It's like I can tell you...

20:09.007 --> 20:12.272
<i>J.D.: As I took Elliot's hand and nodded</i>
<i>to make her think I was listening,</i>

20:12.311 --> 20:14.176
<i>I started to think about hands again,</i>

20:14.213 --> 20:17.444
<i>and how they really are windows</i>
<i>to what we're feeling.</i>

20:17.482 --> 20:19.313
<i>Whether it's love...</i>

20:21.653 --> 20:23.621
If you say anything, I'll kill you.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.888
Come here.

20:28.427 --> 20:29.451
<i>J.D.: Or acceptance...</i>

20:29.494 --> 20:30.859
This is great. It's like I'm steering you.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.057
Look out for weird coughing guy.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.298
<i>J.D.: And sometimes,</i>
<i>they can even express hope.</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:51.375
So you really think
it was the cold therapy that helped him?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.543
I don't know. But I'm glad I did it.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.817
I'm really proud of you, baby.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.755
<i>J.D.: There's got to be a way</i>
<i>I could get on</i> SportsCenter.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.992
<i>Dr. Cox is athletic.</i>
<i>I wonder if he could help.</i>

21:10.836 --> 21:11.894
What is going on?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.199
Involuntary luge.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.706
- J.D.: Eagle!
- Oh!

21:15.741 --> 21:17.572
That's got to hurt.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.770
- Glory always does.
- Mmm-mmm.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.179
- Look at how his leg's all twisted.
- Oh.
