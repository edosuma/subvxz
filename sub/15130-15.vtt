(whirring stops)

00:21.756 --> 00:24.656

no, no, no, no, no. No.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.159
(pushes button)

00:27.161 --> 00:30.095
What?
(pushing button)

00:30.097 --> 00:31.130
Oh, come on.

00:31.132 --> 00:35.234
(alarm ringing)
<i>come on.</i>

00:35.236 --> 00:38.037
Hello?!
(pounds on door)

00:38.039 --> 00:39.638
There's somebody in here!

00:39.640 --> 00:41.473
(continues pounding)

00:41.475 --> 00:43.709
Hello!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.644
There's somebody
in the elevator!

00:45.646 --> 00:47.179
(alarm ringing)

00:47.181 --> 00:49.381
Somebody? Can anybody
hear me?!

00:49.383 --> 00:50.616
(phone off-hook tone droning)
hello?!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.251
(panting)

00:52.253 --> 00:55.254
(thuds)
(whispers) okay.
(exhales sharply)

00:55.256 --> 00:58.524
(breathing heavily)

00:58.526 --> 01:00.359
(whirring resumes)

01:00.361 --> 01:02.661
(sighs deeply and chuckles)

01:02.663 --> 01:04.663
(continues breathing heavily)

01:04.665 --> 01:07.132
Okay.

01:07.134 --> 01:09.668
(exhales deeply)

01:09.670 --> 01:11.670
(sighs deeply)

01:11.672 --> 01:14.640
(bell dings)

01:14.642 --> 01:18.477
(indistinct conversations)

01:18.479 --> 01:19.578
(telephone rings)

01:19.580 --> 01:21.747
Hey.
Hi.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.815
You okay?

01:22.817 --> 01:25.184
Stupid elevator.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.552
But you're fine?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.720
Oh. Nothing like some
histrionics in the morning

01:28.722 --> 01:30.556
To get the blood pumping.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.158
The alex I know
doesn't get hysterical.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.260
The alex you don't know
does.

01:35.262 --> 01:39.832
(cell phone buzzing)
there's an alex
I don't know?

01:39.834 --> 01:42.234
I'm being paged.
See you later.

01:42.236 --> 01:43.702
Okay.
(cell phone buzzes)

01:45.572 --> 01:47.406
I'm not following you.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.543
Mm--yeah,
I'm following you.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.846
Ah. I need you both
in the e.R.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.247
Level one center in sudbury

01:55.249 --> 01:56.515
Has been slammed
with a mine collapse,

01:56.517 --> 01:58.350
And we're getting
their spillover.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.452
A couple has been
attacked by a bear.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.654
We're gonna need
ortho <i>and</i> general.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.123
Any word on their condition?

02:04.125 --> 02:06.458
Well, it was a bear attack,
so I'm assuming

02:06.460 --> 02:08.427
That bones were broken,
guts were chomped.

02:08.429 --> 02:11.230
E.T.A.?
En route
from the island airport.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.265
Okay.
Wait!

02:13.267 --> 02:14.900
(clears throat)

02:14.902 --> 02:17.603
Are you two weird
working together?

02:17.605 --> 02:18.904
No.
We're fine.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.807
Okay. Good.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.276
(machine beeps in distance)

02:24.278 --> 02:27.713
(siren wailing in distance)
(exhales deeply)

02:30.617 --> 02:32.885
(horn honks in distance)

02:32.887 --> 02:35.754
I'm really sorry.
I paged her three times.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.623
It's not your fault.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.158
She's normally very prompt.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.493
The second appointment
in a row.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.863
I know. Uh... The--there must be
some explanation.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.398
I...

02:46.400 --> 02:49.334
(sighs)

02:49.336 --> 02:50.669
See the ball game
last night?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.905
I was, uh, delivering
premature twins.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.473
Look, I gotta go.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.308
But could you just have her
call my office?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.910
We'll reschedule.
I'm really sorry.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.378
Yeah.
I... I just--

02:59.380 --> 03:01.647
Again, I'm really
very sorry.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.749
(door closes)

03:03.751 --> 03:05.817
So...

03:05.819 --> 03:07.653
How are--how are you?

03:07.655 --> 03:09.388
How's the hotel?

03:11.524 --> 03:12.925
It's a hotel.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.294
Good. Good.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.529
(telephone rings)

03:17.531 --> 03:20.432
I paid all
the parking tickets.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.867
Did you pay mine as well?

03:21.869 --> 03:25.871
Yeah. It was kind of hard
to tell whose was what,

03:25.873 --> 03:27.806
So I just, mm,
paid 'em all.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.308
Well, you didn't need to.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.676
It's--it's okay.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.911
It's no big deal.
No, I--
I'll give you money.

03:32.913 --> 03:38.584
You know, just switching over
the names on the bills,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.252
And... (mouths word)

03:40.254 --> 03:42.821
Yeah, I guess that's not
the best part.

03:42.823 --> 03:46.225
(sighs) is there a best part?

03:52.265 --> 03:54.533
(chuckles)
sorry.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.736
Force of habit.
(siren wailing in distance)

03:57.738 --> 04:00.639
(pager beeps)
go time.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.708
Yep. (sighs)

04:02.710 --> 04:04.910
I'm paying
those parking tickets.
Ugh.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.980
(wheels clattering)
meet wayne power,
48, g.C.S. At 15,

04:07.982 --> 04:11.550
Heart rate 120, b.P. 100/75.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.952
Lacerations to the face
and left upper extremities.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.654
Some scratches
you got there, wayne.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.289
I'm fine.
Take care of her.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.857
Abigail!
She's way worse than he is.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.959
Unresponsive, needs
immediate attention.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.027
G.C.S. Is 3.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.364
What have we got?
Head trauma,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.332
Injuries to the chest
and abdomen.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.433
She's in hypovolemic shock.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.603
Pulse 140, g.C.S. 3.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.605
Grey turner's sign.
Yeah, makes sense.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.274
Blunt force trauma leads
to internal hemorrhaging.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.875
(wayne) is she gonna be okay?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.443
I'm gonna do a f.A.S.T.
All right, let's get
central lines insert,

04:38.445 --> 04:39.845
Flooding her with
everything.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.881
Get her a tetanus booster
and an I.V. Of antibiotics.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.583
What happened to her,
wayne?

04:44.585 --> 04:47.352
(grunts) she was in the garden,
and I heard her scream.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.854
You gotta make her okay.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.756
They're gonna do everything
they can, all right?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Claw marks.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.761
Lacerations to the bone.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.962
It doesn't look arterial.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.031
(wayne) it was a huge
black bear.

04:59.033 --> 05:01.300
(panting) she was running
towards the cabin

05:01.302 --> 05:03.869
When it knocked her down
with one swipe.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.504
It was gonna
crush her head,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.339
And I went out and started
beating on it with a pitchfork.

05:07.341 --> 05:08.640
We need to get them
up to imaging.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.776
Food in the abdomen.
Let's get her to the o.R.

05:10.778 --> 05:12.878
No, no! No! Abigail!
(wheels clacking)

05:12.880 --> 05:15.814
Just let 'em do their job,
wayne, let 'em go.
Please, please.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.916
(wayne breathing heavily)

05:17.918 --> 05:19.318
(wayne)
this is all my fault.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.354
(strained voice)
I screwed up. Abigail!

05:22.356 --> 05:24.890
Abigail, honey, I'm sorry!

05:24.892 --> 05:28.527
(groaning) I'm so sorry.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.862
Charlie, are you okay?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.498
Yeah.

05:43.609 --> 05:44.810
Okay, wayne, you've got
an ipsilateral fracture

05:44.812 --> 05:47.112
Of the clavicle
and scapular neck--

05:47.114 --> 05:49.715
Otherwise known as
floating shoulder.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.919
You know what, doc?
I don't care.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.822
When can I see abigail?

05:56.824 --> 05:59.124
Um, well, she's going
to be busy in surgery

05:59.126 --> 06:00.692
For a while,
but when she's done,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.427
I can let you know.
It's all my fault.

06:02.429 --> 06:04.029
I mean, abigail's
from the city.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.498
She's only out there
because of me.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.736
I was supposed to be
protecting her.

06:10.738 --> 06:15.741
Listen, um, I understand
that you feel responsible.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.110
But, um...

06:18.112 --> 06:19.478
A little difficult seeing

06:19.480 --> 06:20.645
Something like that coming,
right?

06:20.647 --> 06:23.682
I don't blame the bear.
I blame myself.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.618
If you corner an animal,
it's just gonna defend itself.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.820
That's just the chance you take
when you live in the bush.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.990
So why live in the bush?

06:31.992 --> 06:34.760
We like our privacy.

06:34.762 --> 06:38.730
Society likes to get
in the way of happiness.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.899
There are worse things
than bears out there.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.468
Yeah, I heard that.

06:43.470 --> 06:44.936
(chuckles)

06:44.938 --> 06:48.006
(man chanting indistinctly)

06:51.778 --> 06:54.479
Victor tells me you're backing
out of the surgery again.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.781
I can't do it, doc.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.449
Kai, this is the third time
you've done this.

06:57.451 --> 06:58.884
You came to me,
you begged me.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.653
You said this time you were
absolutely certain about it.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.789
Yeah.
So I booked an o.R.
For the next five hours.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.590
I've got a surgical team
of six,

07:05.592 --> 07:08.860
Including one of the country's
top neurosurgeons. (sighs)

07:08.862 --> 07:11.062
Do you know how many people
are waiting for surgeries?

07:11.064 --> 07:14.433
I know. I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.500
I just don't understand
why you're coming here

07:15.502 --> 07:17.002
If you don't want
the surgery.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.770
Well, it's an elective
surgery--
that was last year.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.172
Let's check out
your lung function. Come on.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.040
I should go.
What, you have other plans?

07:22.042 --> 07:25.010
No, but--
get in, please.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.612
(door thuds)
look, whether or not
I'm getting the surgery

07:27.614 --> 07:29.648
Is going to be up to me,
not some test.
Right. Fine.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.550
If you want to decide
based on facts,

07:31.552 --> 07:34.953
Let's--just breathe for me.
(types)

07:34.955 --> 07:37.189
(blows air, whooshes)
(computer beeps)

07:37.191 --> 07:38.790
Have you at least
been doing more exercise

07:38.792 --> 07:39.758
Like we discussed?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.860
I meditate
eight hours a day.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.196
Well, the last time I checked,
being is not the same as doing.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.664
(computer beeps)
and blow.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.898
Don't knock meditation.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
I'm not knocking
your wonderful meditation.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.535
I'm not kidding you.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.237
Before I learned it,
I was maxed out on oxy

07:52.239 --> 07:54.105
Just to deal
with the back pain.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.641
Blow harder!
I hate hospitals.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.109
Well, hospitals aren't
too crazy about you either,

07:58.111 --> 07:59.778
But you keep coming
back here...
(air whooshes)

07:59.780 --> 08:01.847
And booking
that same operation.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.883
Blow again.
(blows air, whooshes)

08:04.885 --> 08:07.953
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

08:07.955 --> 08:08.987
Hey, maggie!

08:08.989 --> 08:10.555
Hey!

08:10.557 --> 08:12.224
Why haven't you answered
my pages?

08:12.226 --> 08:14.059
I was busy, I guess.
Sorry.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.660
You missed another appointment
with dr. Kalfas.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.830
Ooh, rats. Um, I forgot.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.965
Um, I have surgery,

08:19.967 --> 08:21.800
But we'll talk
about it later, okay?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.735
Are you avoiding
dr. Kalfas?
No.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.737
But I was thinking,
try a different obstetrician,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.672
Maybe... Maybe a woman.
You know?

08:27.674 --> 08:28.773
Tamara, could you pass me
that file?

08:28.775 --> 08:29.975
What, is it because
you find him

08:29.977 --> 08:32.077
So devilishly handsome?

08:32.079 --> 08:33.178
Hilarious.
Am I right?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.713
(chuckles) no,
you're not right.

08:34.715 --> 08:38.817
Um, I was thinking we, uh,
go with dr. Davis.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.219
What, you mean lazy lana
from your med school class?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.754
She's my friend.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.257
Yeah, but dr. Kalfas
is an actual obstetrician,

08:45.259 --> 08:47.526
And lana davis is just
a resident.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.627
(chuckles) and she only
got through med school

08:48.629 --> 08:50.295
By cheating off your tests.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.597
Well, I like her.
So...

08:52.599 --> 08:53.865
You--
okay?

08:53.867 --> 08:56.568
Six months ago
your lung function

08:56.570 --> 08:58.670
Was at 65%.
Now you're down to 47%.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.905
What do you think
it's gonna be next month?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.274
So I'll get
an oxygen tank.

09:02.276 --> 09:04.676
Awesome, so one day
you go to bed,

09:04.678 --> 09:06.745
You asphyxiate
in your sleep, you die.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.548
It's my spine, man.
It's my spine.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.750
One false move from you
and I'm paralyzed.

09:11.752 --> 09:15.921
Kai, I have done 23
of these kyphosis surgeries.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.623
Every one of these patients
is walking tall now, okay?

09:18.625 --> 09:19.824
Well, maybe I'm just
learning

09:19.826 --> 09:21.293
To accept myself
for who I am--

09:21.295 --> 09:23.128
Hunchback and all.
All right.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.796
The fact that you're using
a pejorative like "hunchback"

09:24.798 --> 09:26.965
Suggests to me you might not
be entirely happy.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.068
I would rather be a hunchback
than a quadriplegic.

09:30.070 --> 09:34.940
Also, women kind of, uh,
kind of dig my imperfection.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.609
Dude, we're dudes.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.211
Okay, by definition
we're entirely imperfect.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.881
Listen...

09:42.883 --> 09:44.883
I'm offering you
a straighter spine.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.986
I'm not getting
the operation.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.788
I'm sorry.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.623
Okay.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.830
(door slams in distance)

09:58.832 --> 10:00.665
She also has
very beautiful eyes.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.100
See, now you're just
being cruel.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.802
I guess you're more
of a leg man, right?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.370
Look, you're not the one
that might die up there

10:05.372 --> 10:07.339
On the operating table.
Is that what
you're afraid of, kai--

10:07.341 --> 10:09.274
Dying?
No, I'm not--no.

10:09.276 --> 10:12.911
Death is not feared by those
who have lived wisely.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.313
I get it, man.
You're terrified of...

10:15.315 --> 10:17.749
Anesthesia, of incision,
of quadriplegia.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.084
I mean, you know what?
Most of all, I think

10:19.086 --> 10:20.952
That you are just
afraid of change.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.922
For you... (sighs)
kyphosis has become

10:23.924 --> 10:27.225
More like, uh, a shield,
like--like a place to hide.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.728
You know?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.667
Here's the truth--

10:35.669 --> 10:38.737
If you don't have the surgery,
you're gonna suffocate, kai.

10:38.739 --> 10:43.008
(sighs)
(cell phone buzzes)

10:43.010 --> 10:44.709
It's...

10:44.711 --> 10:46.878
The time is now.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.982
All right, if I do this...

10:50.984 --> 10:52.717
Will you let me do
one thing for you?

10:52.719 --> 10:54.352
Li--uh, what?
No--no--no.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.420
You don't get to ask
"what?"

10:55.422 --> 10:57.222
Just answer with the gut.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.225
All right.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.263
All right then.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.898
Really?

11:06.900 --> 11:09.868
Okay, so, uh,
so I can get you prepped?

11:11.937 --> 11:14.005
(monitor beeping steadily,
suction gurgling)

11:14.007 --> 11:18.009
(alex) ugh, I can't see a thing.
It's like blood soup in here.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.811
(sighs)

11:19.813 --> 11:22.180
Maggie, how's the spleen?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.682
Spleen's intact.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.151
(clunks)

11:26.153 --> 11:28.987
(sloshing)
it's the liver. It's pulped.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.722
I'm gonna need you
to do a hand compression.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.190
Okay, take that.
(machine beeps)

11:32.192 --> 11:34.459
(sloshing continues)

11:34.461 --> 11:36.428
I will try
the pringle maneuver.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.763
(suction continues gurgling)
got it.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.199
It's working.
Sponge.

11:41.201 --> 11:45.303
There's a tear on a branch of
the hepatic artery. Suture.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.005
Okay.
(machine beeps)

11:47.007 --> 11:49.841
Can you grab this?
Yep.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.779
Can you imagine how horrific
that must have been,

11:54.781 --> 11:55.980
Being attacked by a bear?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.382
I can't imagine
there's much worse.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.050
Though the thought of being
stuck in an elevator,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.953
Screaming like a little girl
is pretty bad.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.288
Everyone's talking about it.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.424
Okay. Done.
Scissors.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.193
Thank you.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.495
Mm-hmm.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.164
All right. Move the liver
to the right.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.066
(beeps)
oh, boy.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.935
There's some bleeding
in here.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.036
Is that what
I think it is?

12:18.038 --> 12:20.138
She's developing
a hematoma.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.974
It's retroperitoneal. Have you
seen one of those before?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.043
No, because most patients
don't survive it.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.146
If it ruptures, she's got
minutes before she bleeds out.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.882
Call dr. Bell. Tell her
to have this o.R. On standby

12:30.884 --> 12:32.083
In case we have
to rush her back in here.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.885
We're just gonna
leave it like this?

12:33.887 --> 12:35.253
The best thing for her
is if the hematoma

12:35.255 --> 12:37.222
Tamponades itself.
I'm not gonna poke that skunk.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.157
So we cover her up
and take her to I.C.U.?

12:39.159 --> 12:42.026
Yeah. Bogota bag, please?
On it.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.298
(indistinct conversations)

12:55.007 --> 12:56.141
Abigail?

12:59.378 --> 13:01.012
(door closes)

13:10.089 --> 13:11.790
(clacks)

13:15.060 --> 13:17.862
Abigail?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.397
<i>Only wayne calls me that.</i>

13:19.399 --> 13:21.132
Oh. Oh.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.535
What do other people
call you?

13:23.537 --> 13:25.003
Abby?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.538
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:26.540 --> 13:28.072
<i>I like that.</i>

13:28.074 --> 13:30.375
Okay.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.277
<i>Am I dead?</i>

13:32.279 --> 13:35.280
No, no. Your, um...
Your body is in the I.C.U.,

13:35.282 --> 13:38.850
And the doctors are trying
to save your life.

13:40.519 --> 13:42.153
<i>So no one can see me?</i>

13:42.155 --> 13:44.222
No.

13:52.865 --> 13:55.366
<i>Except you.</i>

13:55.368 --> 13:56.568
Uh, yeah.

13:56.570 --> 13:57.569
<i>Where's wayne?</i>

13:57.571 --> 13:59.838
Wayne is okay.
Wayne is um...

13:59.840 --> 14:02.207
Uh, he's waiting to have
surgery on his shoulder.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.474
<i>Are you sure?</i>

14:03.476 --> 14:05.176
Yeah.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.313
(chuckles)

14:08.315 --> 14:10.381
<i>I haven't watched tv</i>
<i>in forever.</i>

14:10.383 --> 14:12.884
You want me to...

14:14.420 --> 14:17.355
Okay.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.557
(turns tv on)

14:19.559 --> 14:20.558
<i>(man speaks indistinctly)</i>

14:20.560 --> 14:24.028
<i>...Recognize. Although</i>
<i>there is some disagreement...</i>

14:24.030 --> 14:26.364
<i>(static,</i>
<i>cartoonish music playing)</i>

14:26.366 --> 14:29.100
Yeah, this.
<i>(male cartoon voice)</i>

14:39.946 --> 14:43.548
(wayne whistling in distance)

14:43.550 --> 14:46.651
(continues whistling)

14:46.653 --> 14:49.554
(clattering)

14:49.556 --> 14:52.490
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.524
Uh, is that bugging you?

14:53.526 --> 14:55.627
No.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.895
'cause I won't do it
if it's bugging you.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.496
It's fine, wayne.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.632
It's just a thing
that we do.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.433
Whenever I'm on my way
back to the cabin,

15:02.435 --> 15:05.203
I whistle, and she knows
I'm coming.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.505
(sighs) you think she can
hear me right now?

15:07.507 --> 15:09.507
Can't know for sure.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.543
Well, I think it's worth
a shot.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.646
It can't hurt.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.081
Can't hurt.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.650
(telephone rings in distance,
monitor beeps)

15:18.652 --> 15:20.051
Vitals are stable.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.619
Keep pushing
those fluids through,

15:21.621 --> 15:22.987
And page me
if anything changes.
(wayne resumes whistling)

15:22.989 --> 15:24.422
Yeah, you got it.
Okay.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.060
(continues whistling)

15:29.062 --> 15:30.962
Here you go.
Thank you.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.932
(folder thuds)

15:33.934 --> 15:36.200
(wheels roll)

15:38.370 --> 15:39.671
Um...

15:39.673 --> 15:42.373
Tired or troubled?

15:42.375 --> 15:46.511
Would it help if I told you
you look attractive

15:46.513 --> 15:47.545
Or something?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.415
(wheels roll)

15:50.417 --> 15:52.216
You've lived alone
for a long time, right?

15:52.218 --> 15:56.120
Yes. Since we split.
(clicks pen)

15:56.122 --> 15:57.956
Well, did you know

15:57.958 --> 15:59.290
That I don't change
lightbulbs on fridays

15:59.292 --> 16:00.992
Because I'm worried
that if I fall off the chair

16:00.994 --> 16:02.527
Nobody's gonna find me
for two days?

16:02.529 --> 16:05.496
(mutters)

16:05.498 --> 16:07.098
(papers rustling)
well, what, I mean,
it sounds like you need

16:07.100 --> 16:08.599
A drink or something
like that...

16:08.601 --> 16:10.034
Want to grab a bite to eat
later on, or...
(clicks pen)

What did you do to her?

16:20.046 --> 16:22.046
(jackson) please allow me
to attend to her.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.648
No, I'm staying here!
(melanda) what's happening?
Blood pressure's dropping?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.149
(clipboard clatters)
she went tachy
two minutes ago.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.351
Let me see.
(speaks indistinctly)

16:26.353 --> 16:27.418
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.654
She's filling up with blood.
Please!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.055
No! What did he do?
I saw him.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.490
He was poking at
those wires.
Jackson?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.058
Please! Sir!
I saw him! I am not
going anywhere!

16:34.060 --> 16:35.059
The liver is leaking.
What did he do?

16:35.061 --> 16:36.260
Leave me alone!
Please!

16:36.262 --> 16:37.428
We need to transfuse.
Let us do our job!

16:37.430 --> 16:38.296
Abigail!
Sir!

16:38.298 --> 16:40.198
Get out!
(wayne grunts)

16:40.200 --> 16:41.733
Leave!
(jackson) this way.

16:41.735 --> 16:43.301
We need factors. Platelets!

16:43.303 --> 16:45.103
We need to do a blood
transfusion in here right now!

16:50.075 --> 16:53.311
(monitor beeping steadily,
ventilator whooshing)

16:53.313 --> 16:56.147
Wayne, I understand that this is
incredibly difficult,

16:56.149 --> 16:57.615
But you need to let us
do our job.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.617
Yeah, I understand.
I'm sorry.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.686
I... Is she okay?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.087
Abigail is stable,

17:03.089 --> 17:05.056
But she's in
very serious condition.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.225
What can I do? What--

17:07.227 --> 17:08.259
Just tell me what to do.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.194
You need to try to be calm

17:10.196 --> 17:12.230
And stay strong for her.
Can you do that?

17:12.232 --> 17:13.398
Yeah.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.633
Good.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.535

17:38.191 --> 17:40.391

anyone else out? Ugh.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.361
Yeah, 'cause it sounds

Well, it's what he wanted.
So... (sighs)

17:46.599 --> 17:48.399
If it helps him heal
on some subconscious level,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.668
I say crank it.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.851

such elegance from an orthopod.

Ouch.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.558
Okay, so closing
the osteotomy.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.626

on any changes here.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.220
They're all good.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.256
Okay, shahir, you're up.
Let's do this.

18:45.258 --> 18:50.161
<i>â™ª hare rama</i>
<i>(instruments clattering)</i>

18:50.163 --> 18:56.434
<i>â™ª hare rama</i>

18:56.436 --> 18:58.636
(squeaking)

18:58.638 --> 19:00.471
Wow.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.906
Guy's bones are like butter.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.307
Hmm, what kind of butter?

19:03.309 --> 19:04.809
Is there more than
one kind of butter?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.911
Yes, there--
there are several, joel.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.746
Okay, well, it was--

19:08.748 --> 19:10.214
It was a metaphor.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.416
Um, joel, "like butter"
is a simile.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.752
Let's just try and get
siddhartha out of here

19:14.754 --> 19:17.655
And into recovery, shall we?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.658
His name's kai.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.827
(indistinct conversations)

19:22.829 --> 19:25.163
(door opens)

19:32.171 --> 19:34.739
(hand taps counter)
how's she doing?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.841
Well, the bear
knocked the hell out of her.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.643
She's pretty crushed up
inside.

19:38.645 --> 19:42.246
Well, that's why
we never went camping.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.782
Can you look at this?

19:44.784 --> 19:46.184
That's a tibia fracture.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.718
It looks like
it was broken in two places.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.287
See that?

19:49.289 --> 19:52.323
That is a malunion.
That's not from the bear attack.

19:52.325 --> 19:54.392
That's an old fracture
that's healed funny.

19:55.427 --> 19:57.228
And she's got a few of them.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.497
Bones that have healed
without being set?

19:59.499 --> 20:01.332
Yeah.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.334
Judging from this, she was
never treated by a doctor.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.603
(machine beeps)

20:07.539 --> 20:09.874
(ventilator whooshing,
monitor beeping steadily)

20:09.876 --> 20:11.609
Wayne, you ready
for your surgery?

20:11.611 --> 20:14.679
Hey, I heard dr. Blake
is doing it, not you?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.414
Yeah, it's--
it's a routine procedure.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.949
It's normal for a resident
to do it.

20:17.951 --> 20:20.551
Okay.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.753
I just wanted to tell her
I love her one more time.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.890
Wayne, we noticed that abigail
has some old fractures

20:25.892 --> 20:27.491
That didn't heal properly.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.260
Yeah, she...

20:29.262 --> 20:31.262
Fell getting out of a kayak.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.364
Has she ever been
to see a doctor?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.333
Well, she doesn't need to.
I'm a pro.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.436
I just pull 'em out straight,
tie 'em to a board.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.572
So you've set more than one
of her broken bones?

20:41.574 --> 20:43.641
(wheels rolling)
yeah. (chuckles)

20:43.643 --> 20:45.610
She's kinda clumsy.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.846
And she's got that, uh,
brittle bone thing.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.848
Osteogenesis imperfecta?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.683
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.619
She told me
the first time we met.

20:54.621 --> 20:56.287
She said that
she was fragile,

20:56.289 --> 21:00.324
And I told her
that I would protect her.

21:00.326 --> 21:01.926
(strained voice)
some job I did of that.

21:01.928 --> 21:05.863
(grunts)
wayne, why didn't you
tell us about all this before?

21:05.865 --> 21:09.967
I'm sorry, I didn't think
it was... Relevant,

21:09.969 --> 21:11.469
I guess, is it?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.470
The more we know
about your wife's condition,

21:12.472 --> 21:13.738
The better we can help her.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.874
Look, I'm really sorry, guys.
I-I just...

21:16.876 --> 21:19.744
Oh, gosh, I just can't
do anything right today.

21:19.746 --> 21:22.280
Well, your wife's
in good hands, okay?

21:22.282 --> 21:24.015
We'll do what we can for her.

21:24.017 --> 21:27.018
(telephone rings in distance)

21:27.020 --> 21:28.919
Do you believe him?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.354
What do you mean?

21:30.356 --> 21:31.822
I'm starting to get
a funny feeling about him.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.691
He sets her fractures himself?

21:33.693 --> 21:35.993
Well, I guess, uh...

21:35.995 --> 21:39.297
(wheels clattering)
he's an odd guy,

21:39.299 --> 21:42.433
But osteogenesis imperfecta
would explain her old injuries.

21:42.435 --> 21:43.734
I know, but I feel like
he's just telling us

21:43.736 --> 21:48.873
Okay, let's do a skin biopsy
and see if she has it.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.612
(wheels clattering)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.514
(radio chatter)
your kyphosis patient
is not doing well.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.082
Reycraft's in there.
What's going on?

21:58.084 --> 21:59.450
He's clutching his gut,
vomiting.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.651
You didn't feed him, right?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.520
No. He's puking up
a lot of bile.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.654
Is it dark green?
It's more like
a forest green.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.424
That's dark green.
No, that's hunter green.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.758
(groaning) oh, god!

22:07.760 --> 22:08.993
(reycraft) let's get
an I.V. Morphine infusion

22:08.995 --> 22:10.661
At 4 milligrams an hour.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.063
No, no--no--no.
No pain meds.
(woman) yes, doctor.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.764
Don't do that. Uh, he's got
addiction issues. Okay?

22:13.766 --> 22:14.732
This is going to get worse
before it gets better.

22:14.734 --> 22:17.401
Give me, uh, 4 mgs
of ondansetron

22:17.403 --> 22:19.670
For nausea and one liter bolus
of normal saline.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.572
Jackson, draw a c.B.C.,
electrolytes, and creatinine.

22:21.574 --> 22:22.640
(continues grunting)
done.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.075
Why is this happening to me?

22:24.077 --> 22:25.643
Sometimes when
we straighten a spine,

22:25.645 --> 22:27.011
It puts a strain
on the internal organs there.

22:27.013 --> 22:29.080
C.T. Scan shows that his
duodenum is being compressed

22:29.082 --> 22:30.648
By a superior
mesenteric artery.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.982
(strained voice) why didn't you
warn me about it?

22:31.984 --> 22:33.918
We went over all possible
complications, kai.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.820
Yeah, but this was exactly
what I was afraid of.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.688
It's temporary,
and it's very manageable.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.490
You should have given me
a heads up about the operation.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.791
(lowered voice)
are we gonna debate this,

22:40.793 --> 22:42.360
Or are you gonna come up
with a solution here?

22:42.362 --> 22:43.661
Sometimes the solution
is to do nothing.

22:43.663 --> 22:46.497
Right now you want
to do nothing. (grunts)

22:46.499 --> 22:48.499
What dr. Reycraft means, kai,
is that we're probably

22:48.501 --> 22:49.934
Gonna have to feed you
by I.V. For a few days,

22:49.936 --> 22:51.369
Just give your stomach
a bit of a rest.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.503
And what if that doesn't work?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.138
Well, then I'll have
to go in.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.907
You mean, like, operate again?

22:56.909 --> 22:58.509
That's what I have
to look forward to?

22:58.511 --> 22:59.844
You said you would fix me.

22:59.846 --> 23:00.978
(under breath) right.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.713
(groans) oh, god!

23:02.715 --> 23:05.116
Oh, all right, okay.
Breathe through.

23:05.118 --> 23:08.386
(pants and groans)
breathe.

23:16.995 --> 23:19.997
<i>(girish's "gayatri" playing)</i>

23:19.999 --> 23:23.134
(chanting)

23:23.136 --> 23:25.136
I guess he's feeling better.

23:25.138 --> 23:26.537
The guy just got cut open,

23:26.539 --> 23:28.005
His spine is filled
with bolts and rods

23:28.007 --> 23:30.141
And he can sit up erect
like that.
(chanting continues)

23:30.143 --> 23:33.544
Dead still, no pain meds?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.546
(chuckles) that's amazing.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.881
Mind over matter.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.884
That's a strong mind.

23:39.886 --> 23:41.685
Just make sure
he stays in bed, all right?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.788
Yeah.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.189
I have to get
to the lab, okay?

23:45.191 --> 23:48.058
Two seconds.
(telephone rings in distance)

23:48.060 --> 23:49.693
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.

23:49.695 --> 23:52.763
I'm busy.
Just this way.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.765
(chair wheels roll)
hi maggie.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.200
Hi.

23:56.202 --> 23:58.702
Let's find that heartbeat.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.908
<i>(whirring)</i>

24:03.910 --> 24:05.743
What if you can't find it?
I'll find it.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.911
What if there isn't one,
though?

24:06.913 --> 24:09.980
I know a pregnant lady
when I see one.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.483
(exhales deeply)

24:12.485 --> 24:13.684

24:13.686 --> 24:16.821
<i>(heartbeat whooshing)</i>

24:18.490 --> 24:21.759
That's it.
Thank god.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.462
Wow. That's a powerful
heartbeat.

24:24.464 --> 24:27.465
That's amazing!
That's our baby. (chuckles)

24:27.467 --> 24:29.033
Fetal heart rate's
in the normal range.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.470
Everything sounds
perfectly healthy.
Good.

24:32.472 --> 24:33.871
<i>(heartbeat</i>
<i>continues whooshing)</i>

24:33.873 --> 24:36.540
Okay, we're done here.
(whooshing stops)

24:36.542 --> 24:38.108
(equipment clattering)

24:38.110 --> 24:39.810
Uh, thank you so much.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.545
Really, thank you
for coming back.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.814
You have no idea
how much this means to us.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.050
Right, maggie?
Yeah. Yeah.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.852
(sighs)
okay.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.220
Thank you, again, man,
for coming back.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

24:49.222 --> 24:51.956
I appreciate it.

24:54.259 --> 24:56.093
(chuckles) okay.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.929
So, um,
and I'm not jealous,

24:58.931 --> 25:00.564
But what's going on?

25:00.566 --> 25:03.100
Nothing. He's--
he's a great doctor. Huh?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.668
You're right, I'm wrong.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.003
I'm just gonna go retrieve
some labs results,

25:06.005 --> 25:07.171
And I'll see you later.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.807
Yay! (chuckles)

25:09.809 --> 25:11.642
Yay!

25:11.644 --> 25:14.879
(indistinct conversations,
papers rustle)

25:17.516 --> 25:18.549
I've got the results.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.918
And?
Negative.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.152
What?

25:22.154 --> 25:23.787
No brittle bone disease?
No.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.556
She's got more collagen
in her than

25:25.558 --> 25:27.091
A kardashian family picnic.

25:27.093 --> 25:30.294
But her vitamin d level
is   <i>reall</i>low.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.029
The girl hasn't seen
the sun in a while.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.531
She lives in the woods.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.533
Well, that's quite
the tree canopy.

25:42.674 --> 25:44.742
(sighs) we need proof.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.610
He lied about
her broken bones.

25:46.612 --> 25:47.878
We're gonna need
more than that.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.547
I know because the minute
she wakes up,

25:49.549 --> 25:51.148
He can insist
he's taking her out of here.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.216
Did he give us
any next of kin?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.617
No. Nobody.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.152
Okay, so we need
to talk to her.

25:55.154 --> 25:56.687
(chuckles) how?

25:58.957 --> 26:02.026
I think we need to enact
the domestic violence protocol.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.160
What have you noticed?

26:03.162 --> 26:04.895
Old fractures,
vitamin deficiencies--

26:04.897 --> 26:06.664
Wayne lied
about her injuries.

26:06.666 --> 26:08.632
Does this seem consistent
with abuse to you?

26:08.634 --> 26:10.634
It seems to be, yeah.

26:10.636 --> 26:11.936
So what would you suggest?

26:11.938 --> 26:15.239
You want to document
everything that you're doing.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.841
Take photos of her injuries,
and record them on a body map.

26:17.843 --> 26:19.777
And then
when she wakes up, then...

26:19.779 --> 26:21.779
Talk to her.
Yeah.

26:21.781 --> 26:24.848
<i>Someone turned off the tv.</i>

26:29.621 --> 26:30.988

<i>When did they invent that?</i>

<i>No.</i>

<i>Why would you ask that?</i>

you hide out in here.

a lot of broken bones.

afraid of him.

27:47.332 --> 27:50.267
What?

27:50.269 --> 27:53.070
<i>Did you hear that--</i>

27:53.072 --> 27:54.138
<i>The whistling?</i>

27:54.140 --> 27:55.973
No.

27:55.975 --> 27:58.909
<i>The whistling.</i>
<i>It's wayne. He's coming!</i>

28:01.379 --> 28:04.815
Abby, what is it?

28:04.817 --> 28:07.351
I don't hear anything.
What's wrong?

28:07.353 --> 28:09.420
<i>I shouldn't tell you.</i>
<i>Why?</i>

28:09.422 --> 28:10.454
<i>Because I need him.</i>

28:10.456 --> 28:12.823
<i>(tone sounds)</i>

28:12.825 --> 28:14.224
<i>(woman over p.A.)</i>
<i>code blue--I.C.U.</i>

28:14.226 --> 28:16.360
<i>Code blue--I.C.U.</i>

28:16.362 --> 28:18.929
That's me, isn't it?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.831
(monitor beeping erratically)
b.P.'s dropping,
heart rate's going up.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.166
Her hematoma
must have ruptured.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.034
We need to get her back
to the o.R. Right now.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.302
This is what
we were afraid of.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.804
It's what we're
prepared for. Let's go.

28:26.806 --> 28:30.140
(wheels clattering)

28:33.378 --> 28:34.912
(monitor beeping steadily)

28:34.914 --> 28:37.114
(alex) almost there. And...
(suction gurgling)

28:37.116 --> 28:38.415
Whoa. Okay, clamp.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.118
(suction continues gurgling)

28:41.120 --> 28:43.787
Okay, tie this vein off.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.494
Oh, lady, I hope you can manage
to break free from that guy.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.129
The husband? He a bad guy?

28:52.131 --> 28:54.031
Looks like it.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.500
(sighs) man. How do you know
when you can trust someone?

28:56.502 --> 28:58.135
I don't know.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.269
Got it.

29:02.340 --> 29:03.974
Cauter.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.251
Okay. (sighs)

29:14.253 --> 29:15.953
All right.

29:15.955 --> 29:19.089
That's a big section of liver
we're saying good-bye to.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.025
Well, she's still got
a big section left.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.427
Okay.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.528
Argon beam.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.830
(machinery beeps)

29:29.801 --> 29:33.137
(sizzling)

29:35.273 --> 29:37.808
Let's put in the drains
and close her up.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.910
Okay.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.513
Uh, quick follow-up question.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.881
Okay.

29:43.883 --> 29:45.549
Would a-an abused spouse

29:45.551 --> 29:46.984
Feel the need to protect
their partner?

29:46.986 --> 29:48.852
It's pretty common, actually.
Yeah.

29:48.854 --> 29:53.257
Uh, would they also say that,
um, they <i>need</i> their partner?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.558
You mean abigail?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.260
Yeah.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.195
Okay. Um...

29:58.197 --> 30:01.198
So if wayne is somebody
who needs to be needed...

30:01.200 --> 30:05.002
Then he can go to extremes
and... Weaken abigail,

30:05.004 --> 30:08.038
Undermine her until her
sense of self and self-esteem

30:08.040 --> 30:11.141
Is so shattered that she feels
like she can't leave wayne.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.010
Dependency has a weird effect
on people.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.478
People are
held hostage by it.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.946
What?

30:15.948 --> 30:18.015
I said people can
be held hostage by it.

30:19.317 --> 30:20.884
Kidnapped.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.286
Well, I'm speaking
metaphorically, but--

30:22.288 --> 30:26.323
I know, but... It could also
be kidnapped, right?

30:26.325 --> 30:27.958
Sure.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.426
I mean, there are
many documented cases

30:29.428 --> 30:31.061
Of stockholm syndrome

30:31.063 --> 30:34.531
Where a captive is actually
so dependant on their captor

30:34.533 --> 30:37.034
That they start to protect...
Them.

30:37.036 --> 30:40.270
(indistinct conversations,
telephone rings)

30:46.244 --> 30:49.179
(lowered voice) abigail?

31:05.463 --> 31:07.331
(whispers) abigail?

31:14.239 --> 31:16.006
(sighs)

31:24.949 --> 31:26.416
Really shouldn't be
up and about.

31:26.418 --> 31:28.952
Yeah. No, it's okay. I seem to
have the pain under control.

31:28.954 --> 31:30.254
Well, that's great.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.023
Um, you should probably
still... Lie down.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.558
Yeah, I know.
It's just, um...

31:34.560 --> 31:37.227
Well, I... (laughs)

31:37.229 --> 31:41.398
I haven't seen my face
in a mirror over a sink for...

31:41.400 --> 31:43.634
Seven years?

31:43.636 --> 31:45.569
(laughs) look at that.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.404
(laughing)
look at that.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.405
Awesome.
Yeah. (laughs)

31:48.407 --> 31:50.007
Let's get you back to bed.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.541
Yeah. I know, I know,
I know.

31:51.543 --> 31:54.478
Oh, I am definitely gonna be
doing more walking meditations.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.247
Let's do a walking meditation
back to your bed.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.116
You know, you really should
try it.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.952
What, meditation?
No, don't have the time.

32:01.954 --> 32:04.121
Well, your problem

32:04.123 --> 32:06.123
Is you've got too much time.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.658
Mm.

32:07.660 --> 32:09.293
You're always...
(inhales sharply)

32:09.295 --> 32:11.528
You're filling your schedule...
(exhales sharply)

32:11.530 --> 32:12.663
Checking your phone.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.398
Well, that's the life
of a surgeon.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.233
What time is it?

32:16.235 --> 32:17.534
It's 5:30.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.403
No, it's not.

32:19.405 --> 32:22.673
<i>This</i> is the moment
you need to be in.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.474
You gotta be <i>present.</i>

32:25.710 --> 32:27.177
You know, I kind of get

32:27.179 --> 32:31.014
What you're talking about,
in the o.R.,

32:31.016 --> 32:34.051
When it's just me
with a bone to fix,

32:34.053 --> 32:35.385
The problem to solve.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.055
That's sort of when the world
falls away for me.

32:38.057 --> 32:40.057
What if I told you

32:40.059 --> 32:42.993
That you could have that feeling
any time, any place?

32:42.995 --> 32:44.094
You sound like a drug dealer.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.696
We had an arrangement.

32:45.698 --> 32:47.197
I would get the surgery,

32:47.199 --> 32:50.367
And you would let me do
one thing for you.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.436
(clicks tongue) right.

32:52.438 --> 32:53.670
That.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.272
Yeah, that.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.240
(whispers) okay.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.510
(sighs deeply)

33:03.047 --> 33:04.548
There you are.

33:06.184 --> 33:09.119
<i>I've been exploring.</i>

33:09.121 --> 33:11.121
<i>I used to explore a lot</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

33:11.123 --> 33:14.191
I know what's
going on here.

33:14.193 --> 33:16.126
<i>What do you mean?</i>

33:16.128 --> 33:18.595
What's your real name?

33:18.597 --> 33:21.999
<i>Why are you asking me that?</i>

33:23.234 --> 33:25.235
Because I think
he kidnapped you.

33:26.237 --> 33:29.172
<i>No. It's not like that.</i>

33:29.174 --> 33:31.141
<i>He saved me.</i>

33:31.143 --> 33:32.743
<i>I owe him my life.</i>

33:32.745 --> 33:34.344
No.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.613
No, you don't owe him
anything.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.081
Your life is yours, not his.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.050
<i>Oh, I do.</i>

33:40.052 --> 33:43.120
<i>(voice breaks) I do.</i>

33:43.122 --> 33:46.757
Don't you have parents,
family, someone...

33:46.759 --> 33:48.492
Someone that loves you?
A mom and a dad?

33:48.494 --> 33:50.460
Someone who misses you?

33:53.064 --> 33:54.431
<i>I don't remember.</i>

33:54.433 --> 33:58.101
You tell me your name,
and I'll call them right now.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.338
When's the last time
you saw them?

34:03.541 --> 34:05.642
How long has it been? Months?

34:07.745 --> 34:09.579
<i>(sniffles)</i>
<i>years?</i>

34:12.283 --> 34:15.519
They haven't forgotten you.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.121
I'll bet they're out there
looking for you right now,

34:18.123 --> 34:19.122
And they're desperate
to find you.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.190
Tell me your name.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.458
<i>(voice breaks) really?</i>

34:21.460 --> 34:23.560
Yeah.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.296
Imagine what--what they've
been through,

34:26.298 --> 34:28.165
What <i>he's</i> put them through...

34:28.167 --> 34:29.399
<i>(sobbing)</i>

34:29.401 --> 34:31.134
What losing you has done
to them.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.303
<i>Stop it.</i>
<i>Tell me your name.</i>

34:33.305 --> 34:36.206
Wayne can't hurt you here.
He can't.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.441
He took away your past.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.775
Don't let him take away
your future, too.

34:38.777 --> 34:42.145
Tell me your real name!
<i>It's kayla!</i>

34:42.147 --> 34:43.647
<i>My name's kayla bradley.</i>

34:48.186 --> 34:51.421
(indistinct conversations)

34:54.559 --> 34:56.860
(charlie)
her name is kayla bradley.

34:56.862 --> 34:58.829
Her parents thought
she was dead.

34:58.831 --> 35:00.697
(alex) how did you find this?

35:00.699 --> 35:01.832
I, um...

35:01.834 --> 35:03.500
I googled pictures
of missing persons

35:03.502 --> 35:04.835
Until I found someone
who looked like her,

35:04.837 --> 35:07.337
And then I contacted
her family.

35:07.339 --> 35:11.108
She's been missing
since she was 12 years old.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.344
He kept her prisoner
in the woods for 15 years alex.

35:15.680 --> 35:19.249
He must have thought she was
escaping and attacked her.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.553
He said he fought off that bear
with a pitchfork.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.724
(exhales sharply)

35:27.726 --> 35:30.227
Charlie, there is no bear.

35:36.701 --> 35:39.636
(siren wailing in distance)

35:43.141 --> 35:44.341
(door closes)

35:44.343 --> 35:46.476
How is she? Can I see her?
No.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.412
No, wayne, you are never gonna
see her again.

35:49.414 --> 35:51.348
What are you talking about?

35:51.350 --> 35:53.517
We know who abigail
really is.

35:54.919 --> 35:55.919
What do you mean?

35:55.921 --> 35:57.654
Kayla bradley.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.389
I don't know who that is.

35:59.391 --> 36:02.759
You kidnapped her
15 years ago.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.562
Kidnapped? (chuckles) right.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.498
She ran away. You chased
her down and you beat her.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.934
What, the hikers heard her
screaming,

36:10.936 --> 36:12.335
And you had to think
on your feet

36:12.337 --> 36:13.270
What could do that kind
of damage?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.704
A bear attack.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.207
You're insane.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.910
I love my wife. She loves me.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.312
Now I wanna see her.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.683
(breathes deeply)

36:26.685 --> 36:29.920
You called the cops?

36:29.922 --> 36:32.355
What's wrong with you people?

36:32.357 --> 36:34.824
What is wrong with you people,
huh?

36:34.826 --> 36:37.327
I love her. I love her.

36:37.329 --> 36:39.262
You have no idea
what that's like!

36:39.264 --> 36:40.630
None! (groans)
(man) come on.

36:40.632 --> 36:41.831
(wayne) aah!

36:41.833 --> 36:43.200
Abigail!

36:43.202 --> 36:44.434
(door closes)

36:44.436 --> 36:46.970
(wayne, in distance) abigail!

36:46.972 --> 36:49.539
I wanna see my wife!

36:49.541 --> 36:51.675
Abigail!

36:51.677 --> 36:55.478
â™ª

37:03.821 --> 37:06.923
(footsteps approach)

37:06.925 --> 37:11.695
Look, if I said or did
something wrong, I'm sorry.

37:11.697 --> 37:14.331
Okay? But it would be good
if I at least knew what it was.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.465
Right.
Why would you remember?

37:15.467 --> 37:17.567
You were hopped up
on liquid codeine.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.969
(sets down mug)
wait. What?

37:18.971 --> 37:20.837
So no offense, but you shouldn't
be treating patients.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.439
You should be in rehab.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.574
Maggie,
what are you talking about?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.276
Read <i>luke 4:23.</i>

37:26.278 --> 37:27.811
"physician, heal thyself."

37:27.813 --> 37:31.681
(chuckles) that's exactly what
I was doing. I had bronchitis.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.718
Okay, I had patients to see.
I couldn't stop coughing.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.720
And, look, I'm not used
to taking drugs.

37:36.722 --> 37:38.688
It knocked me right out.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.690
Why should I believe you?

37:40.692 --> 37:44.494
Because I would never jeopardize
a patient's safety.

37:44.496 --> 37:46.529
And look, hey, cough's gone.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.832
Well, the--the bottle was empty.
You were passed out.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.700
I... I just thought that--

37:50.702 --> 37:52.335
I could see why
you'd say that.

37:52.337 --> 37:55.438
But no, you... (chuckles)
you were wrong.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.808
Oh, god.
I feel like a jerk.

37:58.810 --> 37:59.909
Hormones?

37:59.911 --> 38:01.878
It's okay.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.913
All right? Are we good?

38:03.915 --> 38:05.782
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Okay. Come here.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.589
Hey.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.491
Hey.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.394
So jason is going to be
our doctor again.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.962
Really?
Yeah.

38:18.964 --> 38:20.563
Great.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.500
Okay. Um...

38:23.502 --> 38:25.702
I will see you next week.
Don't keep me waiting.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.337
I won't.

38:30.808 --> 38:32.575
So...

38:34.378 --> 38:36.446
That was a big hug.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.548
Mmm.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.951
Let's go home and get drunk
on nonalcoholic beers.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.653
Ooh!
Ooh!

38:43.655 --> 38:45.322
Good thinkin'.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.790
(joel)
okay, so what do I do now?

38:46.792 --> 38:48.591
Breathe through
your nostrils.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.027
(stammers) breathe how?
What do you mean
"breathe how"?

38:51.029 --> 38:53.863
I mean, how do I breathe? I--
no, you breathe like
a human being breathes.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.899
Breathe in.
Now you're just being malicious,
that's all.

38:55.901 --> 39:00.704
Breathe in.
Be aware of your breathing.

39:00.706 --> 39:04.541
And feel the breath
on top of your lip there.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.510
Feel your body relaxing.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.648
Be aware of it.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.017
This is excruciatingly boring.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.453
Well, then <i>you're</i> boring.

39:17.588 --> 39:19.956
You know, that's fine.
Just...

39:19.958 --> 39:22.826
Let go of your boring-ness.

39:22.828 --> 39:23.993
(chuckles)

39:23.995 --> 39:25.662
(josÃ© gonzÃ¡lez)
â™ª saw them gathering

39:25.664 --> 39:27.397
Breathe.

39:28.933 --> 39:31.568
Feel what life brings.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.572
â™ª by the thicket
while assembling a nest â™ª

39:37.041 --> 39:38.875
Hi.

39:38.877 --> 39:44.381
â™ª on alert
for any lingering threat â™ª

39:46.751 --> 39:48.551
My name is dr. Reid.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.987
â™ª building frantically
without rest â™ª

39:50.989 --> 39:53.923
My name's kayla bradley.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.459
Welcome back, kayla.

39:56.461 --> 40:00.797
â™ª walls grew dense
and blocked out the sun â™ª

40:02.800 --> 40:05.869
â™ª caving in

40:05.871 --> 40:09.406
â™ª everyone

40:13.077 --> 40:18.815
â™ª darkness fell,
wiped a once joyous tone â™ª

40:18.817 --> 40:21.785
â™ª then famished

40:21.787 --> 40:25.822
â™ª like possessed,
ended eating their own â™ª

40:47.111 --> 40:52.015
â™ª saw them gathering sticks
from the ground â™ª

40:55.786 --> 41:00.023
â™ª by the thicket
while assembling the nest â™ª

41:00.025 --> 41:02.859
Hey.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.027
Hi.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.030
Good night, alex.

41:07.032 --> 41:09.666
Good night, charlie.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.671
Take the stairs, okay?

41:14.673 --> 41:16.072
(laughs)

41:17.608 --> 41:19.876
I'll be okay.

41:21.846 --> 41:23.947
I know you will.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.819
(telephone rings)

41:29.821 --> 41:32.522
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

41:40.998 --> 41:43.066
(exhales deeply)

41:47.238 --> 41:49.539
So I have a joke for you.
(sighs)

41:49.541 --> 41:50.974
Okay, hit me.

41:50.976 --> 41:54.244
Well, the big surgeon walks
into a bar, tries to meditate.

41:54.246 --> 41:55.545
You?
Yes.

41:55.547 --> 41:57.213
Meditate?
I tried to meditate.

41:57.215 --> 41:58.848
(laughs)

41:58.850 --> 42:00.984
It's--it's not funny.
It's...

42:00.986 --> 42:05.121
Weren't you supposed
to go out tonight, huh?

42:05.123 --> 42:06.656
Treat yourself or something?

42:06.658 --> 42:08.057
Well, that's what you said
I was supposed to do.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.260
Do it.
What I am going to do is
go home,

42:10.262 --> 42:11.995
Slip under the covers
in my p.J.S,

42:11.997 --> 42:13.863
And fall asleep
watching television.

42:13.865 --> 42:16.599
That sounds like somebody
who's hiding from the world.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.603
I'll face the world tomorrow.

42:20.605 --> 42:22.138
You know, I had
this buddhist patient

42:22.140 --> 42:26.142
Who says to me that--
don't look like that.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.745
He says there's no such thing
as tomorrow,

42:28.747 --> 42:30.680
That we have to live in the now,
that each moment is the moment--

42:30.682 --> 42:32.015
Joel. Okay.
No, hear me out,

42:32.017 --> 42:33.950
Because--and this is
revelation to me,

42:33.952 --> 42:35.618
And granted the sort--
the--the person...
I-I don't wanna hear it.

42:35.620 --> 42:36.986
Who would do
this sort of thing.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.022
I just--I think that
we need to--
you, however,

42:39.024 --> 42:41.291
Are extraordinarily
terrible...

42:41.293 --> 42:43.960
Joel...
At giving to yourself.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.595
Stop it.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.701
(sighs)

42:53.237 --> 42:54.971
Thank you.

42:56.774 --> 42:59.042
(laughs)

42:59.044 --> 43:00.643
For what?

43:00.645 --> 43:02.345
(doors open)

43:02.347 --> 43:04.113
For trying to help.

43:06.116 --> 43:07.850
Welcome.
