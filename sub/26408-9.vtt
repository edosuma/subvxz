00:01.740 --> 00:04.038
Previously onSEAL Team...Who is Luis Castillo?

00:04.090 --> 00:06.558
He's Doza's most trusted
lieutenant. El Lazo.

00:06.610 --> 00:08.601
_ He's for_mer
MeXIcan SpeCIal Forces.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.309
Many fear El Lazo
more than Doza.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.783
He's killed at least 100 people.

00:11.830 --> 00:13.616
We find Lazo, we find Doza.

00:13.660 --> 00:15.264
Carla, help us,

00:15.310 --> 00:16.834
and you can go back
to your life.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.791
He will kill me.MANDY:
Nobody's answering

00:18.840 --> 00:20.353
at Carla's.
We're on our way now.

00:21.490 --> 00:22.923
JASON:
I got eyes on Lazo.

00:22.970 --> 00:24.574
He's in the silver Mercedes
heading east.

00:24.630 --> 00:25.585
MANDY:
Jason, I have a bad feeling.

00:25.630 --> 00:26.665
I think we could be burned.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.755
Nothing about this feels right.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.847
SONNY: We're pinned down
from all sides.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.585
Havoc Base,
we have troops in contact.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.766
JASON:
Go through 'em.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.111
CLAY:
RPG!

00:54.140 --> 00:56.870
Hey!

00:58.920 --> 01:00.524
Incoming!

01:08.060 --> 01:11.018
Havoc, this is 3.
Where the hell is our QRF?

01:11.070 --> 01:13.015
That's good copy, Bravo 3.

01:13.070 --> 01:14.367
QRF is getting spun up now.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.191
They drove right into a setup.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.764
El Lazo knew that Bravo
was following him.

01:20.810 --> 01:23.938
How?I'm gonna get on it.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.438
Ray! Lazo, Lazo!

01:38.400 --> 01:41.096
Wait, wait, we need him alive.

01:41.140 --> 01:43.449
Go! Go! Come on,
let's go, let's go!

01:48.450 --> 01:49.621
Pull him out.

01:51.190 --> 01:53.146
Let's go. Come on.

01:55.110 --> 01:56.589
Let's go!

01:56.630 --> 01:58.325
Ah. Ah!

01:58.370 --> 02:00.838
How long until ISR
reaches Bravo's position?

02:00.900 --> 02:02.595
25 mikes.

02:06.950 --> 02:08.372
Break contact east.

02:08.430 --> 02:09.943
Go, go!

02:18.180 --> 02:20.136
Brock!

02:29.140 --> 02:32.018
Son, hold that building!

02:34.150 --> 02:36.710
Move, move!

02:37.630 --> 02:39.325
Move it!

02:42.160 --> 02:43.718
Get him in there.
Get him in there.

02:46.990 --> 02:48.946
Hey!

02:48.990 --> 02:50.332
TRENT:
Last man!

02:59.570 --> 03:02.209
Havoc, this is Bravo 6. We're
still taking heavy contact.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.431
Bravo 6.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.528
QRF is 30 mikes out.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.299
Hey, everybody good?

03:07.360 --> 03:08.782
What?Yeah, I've got all my parts.

03:08.840 --> 03:09.966
I don't know!

03:19.320 --> 03:20.969
We got to go!

03:21.020 --> 03:22.624
Any way but that way.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.454
Follow me.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.263
Here. Hold up here.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.129
Trent, he's bleeding out.I got him.

03:55.190 --> 03:56.259
JASON:
Havoc, this is 1.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.537
Notify QRF
we're five blocks east

03:57.580 --> 03:58.706
from our position.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.364
RAY:
J, the church.
Move.

04:00.410 --> 04:02.275
Ready.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.788
Last man.

04:39.620 --> 04:40.314
Get Havoc our location.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.316
Roger that.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.885
JASON: Colonel,
stay here.

04:48.670 --> 04:50.319
We're low on med supplies.

04:50.370 --> 04:51.849
Couldn't get to my main aid bag.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.388
RAY:
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.775
We are currently trapped inside
a church on the north side

05:08.830 --> 05:10.343
of Calle El Camino and Pladano.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.608
How copy?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.469
ERIC:
That's good copy, Bravo 2.

05:14.530 --> 05:16.748
QRF is loading up.

05:16.790 --> 05:17.745
ISR inbound.

05:17.790 --> 05:18.688
RAY:
Roger that.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.319
Havoc, this was
a coordinated ambush.

05:22.360 --> 05:25.830
Doza had to know that we were
tailing Lazo from the club.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.369
There had to be a leak.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.661
Strong copy, Bravo 2.

05:28.710 --> 05:30.189
We're working
on that problem now.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.889
_ Let's focus
on getting you out of there.

05:31.940 --> 05:34.408
Roger that. Bravo 2 out.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.515
We got a leak?

05:46.560 --> 05:47.982
Could be anybody.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.382
Well, not just anybody.

05:49.430 --> 05:50.601
Somebody with
operational details.

05:50.650 --> 05:54.302
Somebody close to us.

05:57.740 --> 05:59.879
Back's_secure. _
We're movmg upstairs.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.876
Copy that. Keep me posted.

06:04.750 --> 06:08.356
Drove right into
a damn ambush.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.277
Way outside the QRF. Jason
should've called off that tail.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.276
I know.

06:21.850 --> 06:23.898
Hey.

06:23.940 --> 06:25.248
How's he doing?

06:25.290 --> 06:26.245
Internal hemorrhaging

06:26.290 --> 06:28.110
into his abdominal cavity.

06:28.170 --> 06:31.071
He needs secondary care ASAP
or he's gonna bleed out.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.076
Do whatever you need to do
to save him. You understand me?

06:33.130 --> 06:36.088
We lose him, we lose Doza.
We lose Doza, we got nothing,

06:36.130 --> 06:38.121
we're back to square one.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.088
Godly man, huh?

07:31.270 --> 07:36.628
S.Saint Jude, the patron
saint of lost causes.

07:36.670 --> 07:39.491
So we must be in
the right place, no?

07:41.330 --> 07:43.890
Yeah, I guess so.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.929
Hey, you know,
Jude is revered

07:46.980 --> 07:50.802
for listening to the petitions
of the good and the evil.

07:50.860 --> 07:56.036
The cartel? _
They venerate him.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.379
Yeah, well, I suppose you need
a special kind of saint

08:01.430 --> 08:02.829
in a place like this.

08:02.870 --> 08:05.566
Mm.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.431
How long till Doza's men
get here?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.823
Not long.

08:12.490 --> 08:15.618
CLAY: Hey, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

08:15.660 --> 08:19.312
Hey, upstairs is secure.
Come on. Get in here.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.319
Found this. We used some of the
gauze for my little boo-boo.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.235
It'll help.This way. Go.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.848
He call anyone?No outgoing calls or texts,

08:27.890 --> 08:29.539
but there's
a landline upstairs, too.

08:29.590 --> 08:32.809
JASON: Colonel, I need you
over here, I need your help.

08:35.250 --> 08:38.208
I speak English, poco.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.683
Who are you?

08:39.730 --> 08:41.686
We're your friends.
We're here to help.

08:41.730 --> 08:42.867
Con armas.With guns.

08:42.910 --> 08:44.423
RAY:
Padre,

08:44.480 --> 08:45.868
we're very sorry
for bringing this all to you.

08:45.910 --> 08:47.389
We will try to get out of here
as soon as possible.

08:47.430 --> 08:48.567
We don't want to cause you
any more trouble

08:48.610 --> 08:49.690
than we already have.

08:49.740 --> 08:51.560
Did you tell anyone
that we are here?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.781
You saw my phone.

08:52.830 --> 08:55.481
Did you tell anyone
that we are here?

08:55.530 --> 08:56.838
No.

08:56.880 --> 08:59.007
They woke me
coming up my stairs.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.664
Whoa, whoa, you-you slept
through a gunfight

09:00.710 --> 09:02.575
that was taking place two blocks
away, but we woke you?

09:07.110 --> 09:08.714
He says they're firing
and shooting every night,

09:08.760 --> 09:10.409
so he's used to sleeping
right through it.

09:13.590 --> 09:17.287
But he's not used to American
soldados in his quarters.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.501
How do you know
we're soldiers?

09:18.550 --> 09:20.108
I live among soldados.

09:20.160 --> 09:23.072
Cartel or not, you
have the same eyes.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.203
This Saint Jude.
He's popular with the cartels.

09:26.260 --> 09:27.682
They come here?

09:27.740 --> 09:29.685
They got a saint
for these scumbags?Sonny.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.560
SONNY:
Of all the churches we pick,

09:31.610 --> 09:33.919
it's a cartel one.Narcos come here, yes.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.747
But I have no love for them.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.610
No love.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.051
He says he hates the narcos,

09:43.100 --> 09:45.227
and Doza's killed many,
many, many friends of his.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.571
But because
he's a priest,

09:47.630 --> 09:48.574
he can't turn
his back on them.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.925
Because if he did, they
would kill him, too.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.459
We should bail, boss,
while we still can.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.718
Coppertone's right.
We are low on ammo,

09:55.760 --> 09:58.103
and Doza's guys are gonna
find us any minute.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.764
If we move Lazo,
he could die.

09:59.810 --> 10:00.936
Lazo's gonna die no matter what.

10:00.990 --> 10:02.764
Maybe. Not before we get

10:02.810 --> 10:04.949
the information we
need to get Doza.

10:04.990 --> 10:06.423
He's former special forces, J.

10:06.470 --> 10:07.778
You really think
we're gonna crack him?

10:07.820 --> 10:09.208
Waiting for the QRF, period.

10:09.260 --> 10:12.639
Sonny, you and Brock,
overwatch, up top.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.214
Clay, take the colonel,
up front.

10:14.260 --> 10:17.434
Ray, take the padre.
You're with me.

10:19.790 --> 10:23.169
Is Jace_ serious? His call
got us into this trick bag.

10:23.230 --> 10:24.709
I trust Jason.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.308
We're low on ammo,
QRF is 30 minutes out.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.520
You want to wait here?

10:27.580 --> 10:28.831
You trust that?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.620
The call's been made.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.274
Now, you heard the man.
Get to your positions.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.368
Let's go.

10:41.330 --> 10:44.504
Bravo 2, QRF is moving out.

10:44.550 --> 10:46.370
RAY: That's a good copy,
Havoc. Break.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.853
Interrogative.

10:47.900 --> 10:49.208
Any movement
on our leaky ship problem?

10:49.250 --> 10:50.330
Negaﬁve.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.029
We'll sort if out after QRF.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.389
Check.

10:54.430 --> 10:57.388
Bravo 2 out.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.515
[Rita speaking Spanish
in other room]

11:52.320 --> 11:54.880
CISEN is sending help.

11:56.230 --> 11:58.755
We're safer
if we wait for them.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.756
They got to Carla.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.756
She gave up Lazo's name.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.973
They probably tortured it
out of her.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.109
I don't see any signs
of torture.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.768
It wasn't Carla who gave us up.

12:14.820 --> 12:17.243
Had to be someone
from the inside.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.858
What makes you so sure?

12:18.910 --> 12:23.472
How did Doza know we got
to Carla in the first place?

12:24.610 --> 12:26.771
Let's go!

12:47.590 --> 12:49.546
He's stable for now.

12:49.590 --> 12:51.581
Your men left
you, Lazo.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.540
Slithered away
like snakes.

12:53.590 --> 12:54.807
RAY: We're your only
shot at life;

12:54.860 --> 12:56.987
that is, if you talk.

12:57.030 --> 12:58.816
Americans.

12:58.860 --> 13:01.909
But who? Not contractors.

13:01.950 --> 13:03.998
Contractors would be
dead by now.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.258
DEA...

13:06.300 --> 13:08.643
DHS, no.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.827
Special forces.That what you think?

13:10.870 --> 13:13.782
5.1 see myself in you.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.139
There's no you in me.

13:16.180 --> 13:17.784
There is.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.444
Much more than you think,
my friend.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.833
Doza's in the city.
I want to know where he is.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.758
Of course you do.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.268
Tell me where he is,
you get to live.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.844
Where is he?
Where's Doza?

13:28.890 --> 13:30.710
EFRAIN:
Demonio.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.887
LAZO:
S, padre.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.167
SONNY:
Rebel 1.

13:49.210 --> 13:51.474
Be advised we_
have three enemies

13:51.520 --> 13:52.999
window shopping
for American scalps.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.600
Got about 10 minute max
before they come knocking.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.139
3, I need more
men down here.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.954
Roger that.

14:01.050 --> 14:03.518
My men are getting close, right?

14:03.580 --> 14:04.877
Huh?

14:04.930 --> 14:06.966
Sit down, gringo.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.885
Relax.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.315
6, to me.
Stay afraid.

14:12.370 --> 14:14.235
You're gonna die soon!

14:14.280 --> 14:15.929
We can't take them
externally, all right?

14:15.980 --> 14:17.368
Someone's gonna spot
the bodies in the street.

14:17.420 --> 14:18.899
Take him inside.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.373
100% they're gonna be checking
in with their superiors.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.024
Couple minutes of silence
and the rest of them

14:22.070 --> 14:23.503
will be all over us.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.029
I'll tell you what,
you better start praying that

14:25.080 --> 14:26.729
QRF shows up
before Doza's cavalry does.

14:26.770 --> 14:28.556
All right, look, here's the
plan: we're gonna wait for them

14:28.600 --> 14:29.908
to come inside,
we're gonna take them quietly.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.645
That's gonna buy us
a few minutes, got it?

14:31.690 --> 14:32.907
Want to kill these lights?

14:32.950 --> 14:34.429
Yes.
No.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.300
Offerings are made 24/7.

14:36.350 --> 14:38.432
Dark church is a red flag.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.913
Might as well
announce we're here.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.393
All right. Right, of course.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.916
JASON: So that's
the plan, all right?

14:44.970 --> 14:47.393
Ray and I,
we'll deal with this scumbag,

14:47.450 --> 14:50.226
get the information we need to
find out where Doza is. Got it?

14:50.280 --> 14:52.748
Good luck with that.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.320
Can't stop
the internal bleeding.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.631
What's he need?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.636
Blood; got one bag
0 negative with us.

15:07.680 --> 15:08.897
Universal donor.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.635
JASON:
Give it to him.

15:11.690 --> 15:13.999
It's the only blood I have.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.291
We give it to him,

15:15.340 --> 15:17.296
I'm screwed ifI need
to transfuse one of us.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.251
Give it to him.
Can't talk dead.

15:20.310 --> 15:21.959
Jason, he ain't
gonna talk, period.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.399
Give him the blood.

15:24.570 --> 15:26.743
You're gonna risk it
on this scumbag?

15:26.790 --> 15:28.564
Give it to him. Up front.

15:44.980 --> 15:46.845
That's our only blood bag?

15:46.900 --> 15:49.027
Yeah, and my guess is

15:49.070 --> 15:51.982
we're gonna need it,
'cause the weather report says

15:52.030 --> 15:53.725
80_°/q chance of
raining bullets.

15:53.770 --> 15:55.203
Enough.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.901
What you just say?MARTINEZ: I said, enough.

15:57.950 --> 16:00.510
Questioning the man that leads
you is the fastest way to death.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.471
Lazo?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.603
He's our only way
right now to Doza, okay?

16:05.660 --> 16:06.786
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.081
But he ain't gonna talk

16:08.140 --> 16:09.528
and we're being asked
to sacrifice a lot.

16:09.570 --> 16:11.003
Yeah, well, I would have
sacrificed everything

16:11.050 --> 16:13.177
to get Doza.

16:13.230 --> 16:14.390
I've never been
this close.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.312
You two understand _
that we're dealing With a Virus?

16:20.370 --> 16:22.497
See, here...

16:22.540 --> 16:25.885
everyone is
born infected.

16:25.940 --> 16:28.101
The cartel is
their only choice.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.027
How hopeless is that, huh?

16:31.070 --> 16:33.504
There's no escape.

16:33.550 --> 16:37.202
They're in the slums,
in the slqscrapers of Polanco,

16:37.250 --> 16:40.686
in Congress, and look,
even a priest, hmm?

16:40.730 --> 16:44.734
A priest, he can't even hide
in the house of God.

16:48.180 --> 16:52.048
Lazo dies,
this virus will spread.

16:52.090 --> 16:55.218
Well, the virus has
already spread, amigo.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.181
And it's about
to come knocking.

16:57.230 --> 16:58.834
Comprende?

16:58.880 --> 17:00.051
JASON:
Bravo 6.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.227
Move the padre
before the fireworks start.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.054
3, you're with
him. Let's go.

17:04.110 --> 17:05.236
Yeah, roger that.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.757
Hey, Padre, let's go.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.198
In the back.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.719
Move.

17:12.770 --> 17:14.840
Here, here. No, this way.

17:14.900 --> 17:16.413
Down, keep your mouth shut.

17:29.260 --> 17:31.251
CLAY:
Sonny.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.704
What's up?

17:40.750 --> 17:43.093
Something's bothering me.

17:43.140 --> 17:44.789
Abo_ut?
Martinez.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.398
RITA:
Only a few people

17:46.450 --> 17:48.668
outside Bravo Team
knew we had Carla.

17:48.710 --> 17:52.191
Lopez has been
marked for death.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.676
You and I have been
working on this for months.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.280
That leaves Martinez.

17:58.330 --> 18:00.241
Martinez backed_Jason's
plan real qUIck.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.372
Made it easy to
set up that ambush.

18:02.420 --> 18:05.241
Now he's pushing for
Lazo to stay alive.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.939
What if it's not
about Doza's location?

18:07.990 --> 18:10.038
You think it's about
getting Lazo out alive?
Yeah.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.822
And getting us killed
in the process.

18:12.870 --> 18:14.599
Martinez? No, no, no.

18:14.650 --> 18:17.210
I-I don't believe that.
We're missmg something.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.601
Are we?

18:18.660 --> 18:20.082
He's been fighting
the cartel for years,

18:20.140 --> 18:22.267
it doesn't track.
Unless...

18:22.310 --> 18:23.868
Unless what?

18:23.920 --> 18:26.571
Unless they flip him
within the past few days.

18:26.620 --> 18:30.442
His family has been
hiding in Zacatecas.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.445
Well, if Doza got to his family,

18:32.500 --> 18:34.627
Martinez would do anything
to save them.

18:34.670 --> 18:36.752
Would he?

18:36.810 --> 18:38.801
Wouldn't you? If they got to
your brother, your sister?

18:38.850 --> 18:41.978
I hope I never have
to make that choice.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.272
BROCK:
Bravo 1.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.663
This is Bravo 5.
Three of Doza's men.

19:13.710 --> 19:15.701
25 meters south of our location.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.190
My men are here.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.320
Yeah, and they're
about to die.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.109
LAZO:
More will come.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.377
Yeah, and
they'll die too.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.331
And you with them, Lazo.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.075
Unless you tell us
where Doza is.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.336
Doza is everywhere.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.950
Doza is part of everything
and everyone.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.217
Soon _as we start
slinging bullets,

19:38.260 --> 19:39.773
I'm gonna shoot this guy
in the face.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.343
Havoc, this is 1.

19:41.390 --> 19:42.869
Need an ETA on the QRF.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.308
DAVIS:
Bravo 1.

19:44.350 --> 19:47.217
QRF is 15 mikes out,
ISR should be over your position

19:47.270 --> 19:48.350
in 5 minutes.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.708
Copy that.
Standing by to stand by.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.138
If the enemy comes
at us quickly,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.350
we're not gonna
have enough ammo.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.919
We're taking our chances;
we're staying here.

19:58.760 --> 20:02.366
You got a problem
with that, Spenser?

20:02.410 --> 20:03.752
Can't get Doza if we're dead.

20:07.330 --> 20:08.763
I'll post overwatch.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.243
Yep.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.372
J, you sure?Yep, I'm sure.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.729
I got something to say.What is it, Sonny?

20:14.770 --> 20:16.419
Ain't about staying
or going, either.

20:16.470 --> 20:18.779
Okay, look, we were ratted out,
we all know that.

20:20.130 --> 20:22.086
My concerns are with Martinez.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.250
Not gonna lie, J; I've been
having the same thought.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.828
I don't see it.

20:27.870 --> 20:30.566
Well, maybe you've been focusing
on something else.

20:33.310 --> 20:35.266
Why don't you go post security?

20:38.230 --> 20:40.448
Brother, you got to
at least consider the fact

20:40.500 --> 20:43.105
that Martinez may not
be who we think he is.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.978
Let's go ask him.

20:47.020 --> 20:48.146
Come on.
Okay.

20:56.550 --> 20:57.767
What's wrong?

20:57.820 --> 21:00.380
We were set up.
I led us into an ambush.

21:00.430 --> 21:02.773
No, you made the right call.

21:02.820 --> 21:03.946
It was a good one.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.479
I'm not talking about that.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.649
I'm talking about how.

21:10.790 --> 21:13.748
How did they know
that we were coming here?

21:15.140 --> 21:16.744
You just said you were set up.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.576
We. We were set up.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.532
Yeah. "We."

21:27.190 --> 21:29.101
It must have _been someone
from the inner Circle.

21:29.150 --> 21:30.845
Huh?

21:30.890 --> 21:32.107
It's not one of your men.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.765
So, it must be one of mine.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.418
Or even me.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.161
Yeah?

21:43.210 --> 21:44.643
You're hiding something from me.

21:44.690 --> 21:47.250
Yes, I am.

21:52.390 --> 21:54.392
I'm gonna take
your weapon from you.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.691
Don't move, Colonel.

22:12.590 --> 22:14.490
You were hit. When?

22:14.550 --> 22:17.155
During the ambush.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.713
Why didn't you
tell us?

22:18.770 --> 22:20.499
Why didn't you
say something?

22:20.550 --> 22:22.336
Because I knew
that you would use

22:22.380 --> 22:23.859
the medical supplies to save me.

22:23.900 --> 22:27.199
Lazo has to stay alive.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.387
Lazo, alive.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.990
You find where Doza...

22:31.040 --> 22:32.519
BROCK :
All call signs,

22:32.560 --> 22:35.381
we have three enemies
outside the front door.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.359
Stay low, okay?
We'll fix you up.

22:41.400 --> 22:42.958
JASON :
Cover all positions.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.227
We're gonna take them inside.

22:44.270 --> 22:45.658
We're gonna do this
very quietly.

22:45.710 --> 22:48.349
Stay low.

22:50.800 --> 22:54.236
Okay. Okay.

23:38.060 --> 23:41.416
Bravo 1, we got eyes
on the third enemy target.

23:41.460 --> 23:45.066
Check. Hold what you got.
Wait till he comes inside.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.871
Bueno?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.350
He's got a phone.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.308
No clear line of sight.

24:24.460 --> 24:27.679
Did he take a slug?Back in the ambush.

24:27.720 --> 24:30.109
He didn't say anything 'cause
he wanted to keep Lazo alive.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.674
Help me move him.
Here we go.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.518
I told you, more men will come.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.471
Shut your mouth.Get to your positions,
will you?

24:44.480 --> 24:46.380
Boss.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.307
Martinez didn't
rat us out. So who?

24:53.750 --> 24:55.911
All right, look, radio Havoc,
tell them about Martinez,

24:55.970 --> 24:57.790
see if they can get to Mandy.Copy.

25:05.540 --> 25:07.974
Master Chief Hayes.

25:15.290 --> 25:17.986
Last rites.

25:18.030 --> 25:20.498
Bravo 6, I need you
on the first deck.

25:20.560 --> 25:21.640
Bring the padre.

25:21.690 --> 25:24.466
Bravo 5, keep overwatch.Uh, check.

25:27.040 --> 25:30.646
LAZO: Are you ready
to die, amigo?

25:30.700 --> 25:34.215
Are you, Lazo?

25:34.270 --> 25:38.878
Huh? When you meet your maker
tonight, what are you gonna say?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.569
Everything you
done in life,

25:40.620 --> 25:42.576
everything, it's all been bad.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.144
You got no chance, boy.

25:44.190 --> 25:45.839
Not in front of God.

25:48.450 --> 25:50.406
JASON: Padre, give him
his last rites.

26:38.850 --> 26:41.193
LAZO:
They're getting close.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.298
They will keep on coming
until this whole place

26:46.340 --> 26:47.944
crumbles to the ground.

26:47.990 --> 26:51.517
No one can stop them.
No one.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.778
Not here in Ixtapaluca.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.042
He's gone.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.469
CLAY:
A good man died

27:31.510 --> 27:34.070
because we kept
that scum alive.

27:34.130 --> 27:37.827
Hey, how about a little
respect, huh, Spenser?

27:37.870 --> 27:40.338
He sacrificed his life
so we could continue the hunt.

27:42.050 --> 27:44.439
Shouldn't have taken a bullet
in the first place.

27:44.480 --> 27:47.483
What the hell is wrong with you?
What is it that you think

27:47.530 --> 27:49.521
that you see is
going on here, huh?

27:49.580 --> 27:52.663
I see you wanting
Doza for Lopez.

27:52.710 --> 27:55.486
Now for Martinez, man.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.974
Look, Jason, maybe
it's clouding you.

27:58.020 --> 27:59.146
No, it's driving me.

27:59.190 --> 28:00.930
That drive,
does that take,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.402
does that take priority
over our team?

28:02.460 --> 28:05.361
Never. Never.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.854
Feels that way, man.
It feels like it's...

28:07.900 --> 28:09.800
_ feels like
it's personal.
It's not.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.725
Uh-uh. You're missing it.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.590
Most of what we do,
what is it?

28:13.640 --> 28:16.382
Infil, hit target, exfil,
mission complete.

28:16.430 --> 28:18.159
Stir, rinse, repeat.

28:18.210 --> 28:20.519
Different.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.381
This one's different.

28:25.220 --> 28:26.733
Not personal.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.222
This guy Doza, he's pure evil.

28:31.270 --> 28:32.658
Rips families apart,

28:32.710 --> 28:34.519
tortures them,

28:34.580 --> 28:38.448
viciously kills them
just because he can.

28:38.490 --> 28:42.051
That's what drives me.

28:42.110 --> 28:44.408
Failure's not an option.

28:44.460 --> 28:47.418
Every decision I've made
has always been

28:47.460 --> 28:50.065
about mission success and what's
best for the team. That's it.

28:51.990 --> 28:54.333
Don't ever doubt that. Never.

28:54.380 --> 28:56.280
Got it?

28:57.770 --> 28:59.374
Roger that.

28:59.430 --> 29:00.772
Good. Positions.

29:03.690 --> 29:04.736
Lazo:
Padre...

29:11.010 --> 29:13.001
No. Mm-mm.

29:13.050 --> 29:14.779
He's Catholic.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.569
He wants last rites.
I cannot deny them.

29:16.620 --> 29:18.872
Well, he's not gonna get it.
I'm saying no.

29:18.930 --> 29:20.488
You have no right to do that.

29:20.540 --> 29:22.576
I have the power, Padre,
and I'm saying no.

29:22.630 --> 29:25.497
Jason, you are going too far.No, I'm not. He's not
afraid of this life.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.758
I think he's afraid
of his next life.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.971
That's what he's afraid of.

29:29.020 --> 29:31.580
No confessions, no last rites.

29:31.630 --> 29:33.450
You're gonna meet your maker,
you're gonna meet God

29:33.510 --> 29:35.501
with the blood of everyone
that you've killed

29:35.550 --> 29:36.983
all over your hands

29:37.030 --> 29:40.591
and God is gonna
spit you out.

29:43.780 --> 29:47.034
Tell me where Doza is

29:47.080 --> 29:49.992
and Padre here,
he'll give you your last rites.

29:56.140 --> 29:57.744
Go to hell.

29:57.790 --> 29:59.439
JASON: Even the
worst Sinners,

29:59.490 --> 30:01.833
they go to paradise when they
repent. Isn't that right, Ray?

30:05.190 --> 30:07.829
You got ten minutes, tops,
before you're dead.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.848
You tell me
where Doza is,

30:10.890 --> 30:14.109
only God knows how many lives
you're gonna save.

30:17.030 --> 30:21.239
You don't tell us,
anything less than that,

30:21.290 --> 30:22.894
you're gonna be
eating roaches in hell.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.037
DAVIS :
Bravo 1, this is Havoc Base.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.389
ISR is over your position.
I see what appears to be

30:31.430 --> 30:32.738
20 enemy combatants

30:32.780 --> 30:34.566
200 meters south of your pos.

30:34.610 --> 30:37.477
Ray, Trent, take Lazo
up to the rectory.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.998
Bring the padre.
Hey.

30:40.050 --> 30:42.359
I want you to handle this
the way I would want it handled.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.868
Copy.
Good.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.921
Clock's ticking.
Move.

30:46.970 --> 30:50.497
Trent, I'll need you back down.Roger that.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.849
It's wrong to deny him
last rites.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.938
Trent.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.539
You, nor your friend, are God.

30:59.590 --> 31:03.242
Padre.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.645
Ow.

31:45.510 --> 31:46.898
Okay, here we go.

31:46.940 --> 31:48.339
We got about
ten soldiers coming.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.203
Scratch that, make it 15.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.512
JASON :
All stations,

31:53.560 --> 31:56.381
watch your ammo count.
Make your shots count.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.119
Hey, Lazo, you really
believe in God?

32:04.180 --> 32:07.263
Do you?
Yeah.

32:07.310 --> 32:09.653
Then do all you can
to save your soul.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.611
You're a religious man.

32:14.930 --> 32:17.364
You'd let me die
without confession?

32:26.370 --> 32:27.769
Martinez.

32:27.810 --> 32:31.541
You told me his family
was in Zacatecas,

32:31.600 --> 32:34.023
but he told me
they were in Spain.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.469
He probably tells everyone
something different

32:36.510 --> 32:38.990
to protect their
true location.

32:40.130 --> 32:42.473
Who's in Zacatecas?

32:45.570 --> 32:48.607
You told me you were
an only child,

32:48.660 --> 32:50.651
but when I asked you
what you would do

32:50.700 --> 32:52.656
if they got to your brother
or your sister,

32:52.700 --> 32:57.000
you didn't deny having
a brother or a sister.

33:02.630 --> 33:05.793
It wasn't Martinez
they got to. It was you.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.489
Who is in Zacatecas?

33:15.120 --> 33:17.202
My sister,

33:17.250 --> 33:19.115
Yolanda.

33:19.170 --> 33:21.161
Her two girls.

33:33.830 --> 33:35.616
You're not a cold-blooded
killer, Rita.

33:35.660 --> 33:38.481
No, but they are.

33:38.530 --> 33:40.669
I can't lose my family to this.

33:40.710 --> 33:43.178
PADRE:
Santa Mara,

33:43.230 --> 33:46.142
llena eres de gracia:

33:46.190 --> 33:48.499
el Seor es contigo.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.974
Bendita t eres_
entre todas las mUJeres,

33:51.020 --> 33:53.159
y bendito es el fruto
de tu vientre: Jess.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.327
Santa Mara, Madre de Dios,

33:55.380 --> 33:57.848
ruega por nosotros pecadores,

33:57.900 --> 33:59.071
ahora y en la hora
de nuestra muerte...

34:14.400 --> 34:18.916
DAVIS : Bravo Team,
QRF is coming in five.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.161
Incoming!

34:54.390 --> 34:57.086
[bullets ricocheting,
glass shattering]

35:17.070 --> 35:19.709
All stations, be advised,
I see two enemy combatants

35:19.760 --> 35:21.978
outside the north entrance
of the church.

35:42.700 --> 35:43.871
Lazo.

35:43.920 --> 35:45.649
You want to die
damned

35:45.700 --> 35:47.395
You're on your way out.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.919
What do you want
your final act to be?

35:54.500 --> 35:56.274
What do you want
your final act to be?

35:57.370 --> 35:58.849
RAY:
Hey! Lazo!

35:58.890 --> 35:59.970
Come on!

36:02.370 --> 36:04.326
Okay.

36:04.370 --> 36:06.372
I will tell you...

36:06.420 --> 36:08.468
Once chance. No games.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.161
Sit. Sit down.

36:29.570 --> 36:33.791
When I joined CISEN,
I rewrote my history.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.446
No one knew I had a sister,
except a few in the agency.

36:37.490 --> 36:42.450
Someone inside turned,
told Doza about her-- Yolanda.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.458
They sent me pictures
of my sister

36:45.500 --> 36:48.458
and my two nieces shopping.
They were that close to them.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.284
Then we go get them. We
get them some protection.

36:50.330 --> 36:55.108
There is no protection anywhere,

36:55.160 --> 36:58.072
because Doza is everywhere.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.599
Doza will be dead soon.

36:59.650 --> 37:01.129
Then another Doza comes.

37:01.170 --> 37:03.081
Then another
Doza dies.

37:03.130 --> 37:05.735
That's what we do.
You don't do this.

37:05.780 --> 37:07.509
Turn?

37:12.360 --> 37:14.999
Tell him. Tell him he can't lie.
Not under last rites.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.627
Where's Doza?

37:27.070 --> 37:28.412
Padre, stop! StoplThis isn't right!

37:28.460 --> 37:29.802
Where's Doza?! Tell me!

37:33.330 --> 37:36.675
It's a safe house.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.857
It's a safe house
for when things go wrong.

37:38.900 --> 37:39.719
Address.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.308
Padre, give him his last rites.

37:52.350 --> 37:55.820
PADRE:
I can't.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.178
He's dead.

38:02.540 --> 38:04.667
Stay low, Padre.

38:06.150 --> 38:08.277
Last box!

38:22.950 --> 38:24.906
All stations, this is Bravo 2.
Be advised,

38:24.950 --> 38:27.077
I did a battlefield
interrogation and have been told

38:27.130 --> 38:30.384
to check out the warehouse
at the end of the Candela Line.

38:39.140 --> 38:43.099
They told me what
they would do to my nieces.

38:43.140 --> 38:47.270
Rape them, and torture them
to death in front of my sister.

38:48.930 --> 38:52.104
All because I'm ﬁghting
a war that cannot be won.

38:52.150 --> 38:56.063
And even if it could be,
is it worth it?

38:56.110 --> 38:59.637
Is anything worth that?

39:16.610 --> 39:18.862
I am sorry.

39:24.970 --> 39:27.962
Rita?

39:28.010 --> 39:30.001
I'm gonna come after you.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.494
And I will find you.

39:32.540 --> 39:34.496
I know.

39:51.080 --> 39:53.207
Havoc, this is 1. We're gonna
get shot out of here.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.511
Stand by, Bravo 1.

40:26.330 --> 40:29.117
ERIC: Bravo 1, this is Havoc
Actual. You want to let me in?

40:29.160 --> 40:31.685
Password.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.686
ERIC:
Rosebud's the password.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.325
Lazo?

41:05.370 --> 41:07.622
He's dead.

41:22.650 --> 41:26.086
He sacrificed his life
for his country.

41:28.220 --> 41:31.826
He was a hero.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.825
Hey.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.134
We're at Doza's doorstep now.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.260
Only thing left,

41:39.320 --> 41:42.050
we put a bullet in his head.

41:45.590 --> 41:48.366
Let's load up and move out.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.511
Ayudame.
