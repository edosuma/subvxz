01:51.845 --> 01:52.880
- Quickly, Mike!

02:14.668 --> 02:16.069
- Quick, come on!

02:18.839 --> 02:19.773
- Fuck!

02:19.807 --> 02:21.008
Oh, we need to find a way out!

02:21.041 --> 02:21.842
- Where?

02:26.314 --> 02:28.115
- Quick, quick, quick!

03:15.763 --> 03:16.564
- Run!

03:28.909 --> 03:29.710
- I can't,

03:31.345 --> 03:33.847
I can't, I can't keep running.

03:36.984 --> 03:40.153
Do we even know
where we're going?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.024
- We're so close, we just,

03:44.024 --> 03:47.361
we just, we've just
got to keep moving.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.896
- How can you be sure?

03:50.598 --> 03:53.200
It's been days since
we've seen daylight.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.167
How can you know?

03:54.201 --> 03:56.136
- I just do, Keeley, okay?

03:57.605 --> 04:02.410
We've got to get out of here
before it realizes we've gone.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.112
- They're all gone.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.214
What do we do?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.521
- Okay,

04:13.554 --> 04:15.756
We get out of here
and we survive.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.757
For them.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.292
Do you understand?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.195
- Whatever that thing was,

04:22.195 --> 04:23.531
it wasn't human.

04:25.799 --> 04:26.600
- We've got to keep going.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.668
Please.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.869
Okay?

04:33.106 --> 04:33.907
Come on!

04:47.655 --> 04:48.456
He's here!

04:48.489 --> 04:49.289
Come on!

04:53.527 --> 04:56.764
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,

04:56.797 --> 04:59.132
He's here, he's close.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.436
- Mike.
- Wait, no!

05:02.436 --> 05:03.804
Listen to me, okay?

05:03.804 --> 05:04.838
Listen to me.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.709
We need to go into the church,

05:08.709 --> 05:09.843
and we need to hide out
until someone comes.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.911
- No, we need to get out.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.546
No, we need to get out of here!

05:12.613 --> 05:13.814
- Shh, shh!

05:13.847 --> 05:16.450
Quiet, you're going
to get us killed!

05:16.450 --> 05:17.250
- No, no.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.158
Come on, come on!

05:28.161 --> 05:29.096
- Just go!

05:29.096 --> 05:30.130
Go, just run!

05:31.031 --> 05:32.232
Go!

05:32.265 --> 05:33.200
Run!

05:42.476 --> 05:43.276
No,

05:59.359 --> 06:00.628
- What are you doing?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.695
No!

06:01.729 --> 06:02.563
Let me in!

06:02.563 --> 06:03.363
Please!

06:03.397 --> 06:04.197
No!

06:06.967 --> 06:08.736
- Told you not to
go into those woods!

06:08.769 --> 06:09.770
I told you!

06:11.639 --> 06:12.440
- Please!

06:12.473 --> 06:13.273
No!

06:17.277 --> 06:18.278
Let me in!

06:18.278 --> 06:19.079
No!

06:31.124 --> 06:31.925
No!

06:37.230 --> 06:40.033
- Forgive me, Lord, for
I must protect myself.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.085
- Casey, are you
sure it's in here?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.920
- I swear that's where
I put the suncream.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.756
- Well, if not you can
always borrow some of mine.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.991
- I'm just thinking though,

07:04.024 --> 07:05.425
surely between us
it's only going

07:05.425 --> 07:06.894
to last a day or two,

07:06.927 --> 07:09.630
and I don't want to look like
a lobster for my wedding!

07:10.564 --> 07:11.364
- True,

07:12.733 --> 07:14.935
well, I definitely can't see it.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.570
- Don't worry about
it, I'll figure it out.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.439
Do you think I need to
pack any more shorts?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.041
- How many have you got?

07:21.074 --> 07:21.875
- Three pairs?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.445
- We're only going
for a few days!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.847
You could probably get away

07:26.880 --> 07:28.916
with the ones you're
wearing and pack a spare.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.118
- Aw, I always over-pack!

07:33.153 --> 07:34.555
- Well, don't worry,
'cause I always under-pack

07:34.555 --> 07:36.356
and I get to pinch
your stuff, so,

07:36.356 --> 07:37.725
feel free to pack whatever.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.361
- Hey,

07:42.429 --> 07:44.865
I wanna ask you something.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.935
* I just wanna get you married

07:47.935 --> 07:52.906
* Wanna get you married

07:53.841 --> 07:56.009
* - Why does this feel weird?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.811
- It's not weird,

07:57.811 --> 08:00.313
I wanted to ask you and,

08:00.313 --> 08:03.851
I know I said I was going
to keep it low-key, but,

08:03.884 --> 08:05.452
I was just wondering if,

08:07.921 --> 08:08.922
potentially,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.726
you would be my bridesmaid?

08:14.427 --> 08:15.696
- Oh my God!

08:16.964 --> 08:19.733
Wow, I was starting to
think you'd never ask!

08:19.733 --> 08:22.135
- I just need to run a
few things past Tim, so...

08:24.004 --> 08:27.407
- Run past, who you asked
to be your bridesmaid?

08:27.407 --> 08:29.209
Wow, that's not controlling.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.146
- What's your issue
with him, Ava?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.416
- It's fine, no, it's,

08:38.285 --> 08:41.488
you know, if, if
he loves you and,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.958
he's 100% the person
you want to be with,

08:44.958 --> 08:45.759
then amazing!

08:45.793 --> 08:46.594
Go for it.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.965
Only you know what you want
for you and your future.

08:53.066 --> 08:53.867
- It's just,

08:55.402 --> 08:57.805
when you put it like that,
it just sounds so, like...

09:01.408 --> 09:03.043
- Well, this should
be exciting, okay?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.878
And your best friend
shouldn't be making you feel

09:04.912 --> 09:06.313
any other way.

09:06.313 --> 09:09.016
So fuck me and my opinion!

09:09.049 --> 09:09.883
And you do you.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.486
I just want you to be happy.

09:17.925 --> 09:19.326
I love you.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.227
- I love you too.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.764
- Sorry for being such a bitch.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.083
- Girls, I think
she's gonna love this.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.918
It's just so thoughtful.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.887
- Aw, thank you Mrs. Drake.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.321
- It's so nice you
girls have kept

09:48.355 --> 09:50.891
such a tight group since school.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.927
- Yeah, but some
things never change.

09:53.961 --> 09:54.762
Late.

09:54.762 --> 09:55.729
As usual.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.197
- Yara, you know my daughter.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.667
She'll be late to her
own wedding, most likely.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.636
- Speaking of the devil,

10:04.604 --> 10:05.673
Right, okay, ladies!

10:05.673 --> 10:06.874
We need to hit the road.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.709
Got a three-hour
drive ahead of us.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.377
- Don't look at me, I
tried to get her moving.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.611
- I'm sorry!

10:11.645 --> 10:13.013
I don't go camping, I
don't know what to pack!

10:13.013 --> 10:14.214
- What do you mean?

10:14.247 --> 10:16.249
All you need is a
T-shirt and shorts!

10:16.249 --> 10:17.484
- Maybe that's all you need,

10:17.484 --> 10:18.886
but some of us need
a change of clothes.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.121
Hey!

10:21.121 --> 10:22.555
Mom!
- Surprise!

10:24.091 --> 10:26.093
- What a great surprise!

10:26.927 --> 10:28.195
- She had to come.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.396
Plus, she said
she'd cook for us.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.998
So why the hell not?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.232
- I can double up, you see?

10:32.265 --> 10:33.266
- Sounds great, mum.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.204
- Oh, you gotta put this on.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.406
- Oh God, really?

10:39.406 --> 10:40.674
- Yes, and this.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.012
- Ooh, a veil!

10:45.045 --> 10:46.413
Thank you!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.849
- Does that feel all right?
- Yeah, I'm in!

10:48.882 --> 10:51.184
- Right, girls, Tour Guide Yara

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
says it's time for the
first obligatory selfie.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.789
- Yes, selfie!
- Right, everyone get in.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.589
- We ready?

10:56.656 --> 10:57.424
Everyone get in.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.291
- Yeah, I'm ready!

11:00.427 --> 11:01.328
- Ready, three, two, one.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.651
- Oh, isn't this lovely?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.654
- Yeah, of course it is, mum.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.427
- Do you mind if I
stretch for a bit?

12:07.494 --> 12:08.361
- Oh, sure.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.833
Why don't we all
grab some water?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.234
I think we're gonna need it.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.035
- Sure.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.671
Are you
excited for the big day?

12:20.007 --> 12:21.241
- A mix of feelings.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.043
Yeah, of course I am, just,

12:24.611 --> 12:29.049
I'm in my mid-20s and I'm
making a huge commitment.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.884
- Everyone has those worries.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.285
I mean, a marriage
isn't something you can

12:32.285 --> 12:33.486
just wake up someday and say,

12:33.520 --> 12:34.988
I don't want to
do this any more.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.231
- Hey.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.365
How's baby doing?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.135
- Yeah.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.136
Bit of an adventure
for both of us.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.280
Have you told her ye?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.815
- Lizzie, not now,

13:01.849 --> 13:03.683
- She's getting married to him.

13:03.683 --> 13:07.254
If you don't tell her
now, when will you?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.389
You do
love him, don't you?

13:09.389 --> 13:10.790
Tim?

13:10.824 --> 13:12.225
- Of course I do.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.827
- Well, that's all
that matters, then.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.562
It's be fine.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.030
All right, ladies!

13:17.097 --> 13:17.931
Can we get going?

13:19.332 --> 13:20.567
- Yes, Tour Guide Yara.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.536
- I'll take that.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.304
- Mm?

13:30.110 --> 13:32.112
- That's not on the map.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.950
- I would say that's not south.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.319
No, I think
it is south, because
if you look there-

13:39.319 --> 13:40.753
This is not south.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.956
No, it is
south, 'cause look.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.158
- Wait, let me have a look.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.210
- No one's in there.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.445
- You know, I'd have
loved to get married

14:05.445 --> 14:06.446
somewhere like this.

14:07.915 --> 14:11.518
- I know, you always talked
about that fairytale wedding.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.353
- I know, it'd be
perfect, right?

14:20.327 --> 14:21.628
- Someone there?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.769
- Can't see anything.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.209
'Scuse me.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.313
- Oh, um, sorry, we, um,

14:40.313 --> 14:42.515
we didn't know this
was a working church.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.516
- It's not.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.952
Not anymore.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.454
I just stick around here,
look after the place.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.491
- Cool, We'll be going, then.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.760
- What are you doing
around this area?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.362
- Sorry?

14:55.395 --> 14:58.398
- The path to the north, it's
out of bounds to the public.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.168
- Oh, um, is it?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.436
No, I used to come
here as a kid.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.837
I think it's fine.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.806
- Not to the north.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.707
It's out of bounds.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.409
Has been for a long time.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.311
You must be thinking
of further south.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.282
- Well, we won't trespass
anywhere that's private.

15:15.282 --> 15:18.251
- It's not about it
being private land, girl.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.953
It's about what you'll
find in those woods.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.356
Those woods are a maze,
and if you get lost,

15:23.356 --> 15:24.724
Hell knows what lurks.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.427
- Sure thing.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.730
- Okay, have a nice day,

15:33.166 --> 15:35.235
- I'm warning you now,
don't go any further north.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.374
If you do come across it,
the organ will hold it off.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.590
- Lovely.
- Ooh, can I see?

15:57.590 --> 15:57.991
Yeah, yeah.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.228
- Oh, that's so good.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.030
- Oh, I look like an elephant!

16:03.030 --> 16:05.632
No, you'll
really treasure it.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.866
What's with that face?

16:06.933 --> 16:08.001
- Oh, this priest
wasn't too happy

16:08.001 --> 16:09.602
about us hiking in this area.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.638
- Uh, more like we need to
get the hell out of here

16:11.671 --> 16:13.706
before Leatherface
comes and hacks us up.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.443
- Okay, let's get going.

16:16.443 --> 16:19.746
- Yep, which way?
- That way.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.214
- Great, come on.
- Come on.

16:31.224 --> 16:32.892
- They never listen.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.596
- You girls forgotten how
to put a tent up or what?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.832
- It's been a while, okay?

17:45.832 --> 17:47.634
- I'm excused, I'm pregnant.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.037
- You know, I think I
agree with what that guy,

17:51.037 --> 17:52.272
the priest, said.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.174
I don't think this is
where we used to camp.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.109
- Okay, we might've got
a little bit lost, but,

17:56.109 --> 17:57.610
I still think it's really
beautiful around here.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.046
- Yeah, yeah, no, I'm not
saying that, it's just,

18:00.046 --> 18:02.215
definitely could've gone
in a different direction.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.386
- Do you think there's anything
else we have to be wary of?

18:06.386 --> 18:08.188
- Like what?

18:08.188 --> 18:11.791
- I don't know, like, bears
or snakes, or something.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.693
- Somehow, I think
we'll be all right.

18:15.528 --> 18:16.763
You know, I think
these tents are going

18:16.763 --> 18:18.531
to be a bit smaller
than what I thought.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.833
I still think they'll
fit three of us, though.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.204
- Can someone help me get
some logs for the fire?

18:24.204 --> 18:25.805
Gonna need to get it
going pretty quick

18:25.805 --> 18:28.107
if we're going to whip
up some food before dark.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.010
- I'll help.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.789
- Did you want me to take
over the tent situation?

18:42.855 --> 18:43.656
- Please.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.664
- I can already feel the burns.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.167
- Come here, I'll do you back.

18:55.402 --> 18:56.469
- Please!

18:57.604 --> 18:59.272
It's the only place
I can't reach.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.345
- Oh my God, remember our first
holiday away with the girls?

19:06.446 --> 19:08.648
- Oh my God, our 18th!

19:08.648 --> 19:11.651
We went to Spain and
got totally wasted.

19:12.752 --> 19:13.553
- God,

19:14.987 --> 19:16.556
mental in a lot of ways.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
- Um, all done?

19:20.327 --> 19:23.330
- Ah, well, I hadn't
done the other side, but-

19:23.363 --> 19:25.732
- It's fine, the sun's
setting soon anyway, so.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.204
- You know, you don't
have to be like this.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.509
Every time anyone
brings up that trip,

19:36.509 --> 19:38.044
you just get all awkward
and you won't speak

19:38.044 --> 19:40.079
to me for the rest of the night.

19:40.112 --> 19:40.913
- No I don't.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.283
- Okay,

19:43.283 --> 19:45.084
- Stop making it weird.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.286
- I don't think I am.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.490
It was just a kiss.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.127
- Could someone give us a
hand with the logs, please?

19:55.161 --> 19:56.496
- Wow, mum, let me help.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.369
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.202
Phew.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.611
Thought you'd have
them up by now.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.562
- Who's best man for
the wedding, then?

21:35.595 --> 21:37.597
- Um, he works with Tim.

21:37.597 --> 21:38.998
He's worked with Tim for a
couple of years at his job-

21:39.031 --> 21:40.132
Oh, so
he's born into it?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.669
- Oh, come on!

21:42.735 --> 21:46.105
- Tim is so-
- He's not that bad!

21:46.105 --> 21:47.907
- Slightly!
- He's not bad at all!

21:47.907 --> 21:49.442
- Yeah mum, thanks mum!

21:49.442 --> 21:50.242
He's just
got one of these rubbish,

21:50.276 --> 21:51.511
stuffy-looking jobs.

21:51.544 --> 21:54.113
That website looks
terribly important.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.915
- Ha, he does.
- He's a very nice man.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.083
- He is!

21:57.083 --> 21:58.585
I'm marrying him, so-
- Of course!

21:58.651 --> 22:00.387
- I mean, who wants to
be described as nice?

22:00.387 --> 22:01.187
Come on!

22:02.355 --> 22:04.591
It's like being
described as vanilla.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.825
- I seem to recall
that I was the one

22:05.892 --> 22:08.160
who introduced you to
Tim in the first place.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.629
- Sort of!

22:09.696 --> 22:10.930
- Oh come on, I introduced
you to him because

22:10.963 --> 22:13.766
of that douchebag guy I
was dating at the time.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.869
- Oh yeah, well,
something Tim always likes

22:16.936 --> 22:19.472
to remind me is that we
actually dated online

22:19.472 --> 22:21.273
a few years prior.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.475
- Oh my God, how
did I not know that?

22:22.509 --> 22:25.277
- I dunno, but yeah, we
chatted online first.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.146
But you are right in
that you did sort of

22:27.213 --> 22:28.615
set the actual date up.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.150
- What can I say?

22:31.217 --> 22:32.519
Dating agency over here.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.187
Dating
agency and tour guide.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.590
- Well, can you hurry
up and find me a man

22:37.590 --> 22:39.926
because I think I'm
gonna be single forever.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.231
- Don't worry, Lizzie, I'll
marry you if no one else will.

22:45.231 --> 22:47.400
- Oh no, can you
imagine my dad's face?

22:47.400 --> 22:49.335
- What, you don't think
he'd approve of me?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.504
- No, he's a
homophobic little shit!

22:53.372 --> 22:54.607
- You know, it's a
shame that generation

22:54.607 --> 22:56.242
haven't changed their mindset.

22:56.275 --> 22:59.412
- If his generation, I'm
guessing, is the same as mine,

22:59.446 --> 23:00.847
you need to understand
we were brought up

23:00.847 --> 23:02.949
in a totally different time.

23:02.949 --> 23:06.385
It was assumed you'd be a
carbon copy of your parents.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.254
Anyone who went in a
different direction

23:08.287 --> 23:10.289
was regarded as
being a bit weird.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.393
- Yeah, but I mean we know
so much different now.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.429
How would you feel if
Casey or her sister

23:16.496 --> 23:17.997
turned out to be a lesbian?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.767
- Well, you always want
grandchildren, don't you?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.769
So that's where it
gets a bit hard.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.484
- You can still have
grandchildren, though.

23:37.484 --> 23:38.685
Just because you're gay

23:38.685 --> 23:40.052
doesn't mean you can't
have grandchildren.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.588
- Yes, yes, of course.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.089
Of course you could, yes.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.066
- Well, I think we all need
another bottle of wine,

23:54.133 --> 23:56.202
and then we'll go to bed.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.436
Great plan.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.038
We all need to be up
super early tomorrow.

23:59.038 --> 24:00.006
Cheers, everyone!

24:00.006 --> 24:02.074
Thank you for a lovely hen do!

24:02.108 --> 24:03.042
Cheers.

24:08.147 --> 24:09.749
- If we carry on like
this, someone's going

24:09.749 --> 24:10.750
to ask us what's up.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.425
It was a one time
thing, what we did.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.795
It isn't something
to hold on to.

24:24.731 --> 24:26.799
- It wasn't just one
time, though, was it?

24:28.334 --> 24:30.369
- what do you
expect from me, Ava?

24:30.402 --> 24:31.203
Look, I'm not,

24:32.672 --> 24:35.575
I'm not trying to make you
feel like shit, I'm just,

24:37.276 --> 24:38.945
just thought we
got past all this.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.187
- I just feel like it wouldn't

24:48.187 --> 24:49.722
have happened the
number of times

24:49.722 --> 24:51.190
that it did if it was nothing.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.195
And I'm just finding
it hard, is all,

24:56.195 --> 24:57.496
to see you marry someone,

24:59.766 --> 25:02.368
when you don't even
know who you are yet,

25:02.368 --> 25:04.571
like you haven't given
yourself the chance

25:04.604 --> 25:08.007
to find out who
you actually are.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.111
- And who am I, Ava?

25:14.647 --> 25:16.048
- You're someone
in their mid-20s

25:16.082 --> 25:18.585
who hasn't lived life
enough to know yet.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.404
- If you want to
go home tomorrow,

25:38.404 --> 25:39.806
I won't hold it against you.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.745
- I'll see in the morning.

26:06.465 --> 26:09.769
- Good, girls?
- Mm, yeah, cracking actually.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.037
- It's great, thanks mum.

26:12.038 --> 26:12.839
- Ugh.

26:26.786 --> 26:27.586
You're up late, Ava.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.956
- Ah, I couldn't sleep.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.958
- Do you know, I had
that problem myself?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.225
Anyhow, don't worry.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.361
In a day or two you'll
have settled right in.

26:35.361 --> 26:36.763
- Thanks.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.564
- All right, so I'm
thinking we head south-bound

26:38.597 --> 26:39.999
for the rest of the afternoon,

26:39.999 --> 26:41.533
and if this map's right,

26:41.567 --> 26:42.769
it should take us to this
lovely little cliff spot,

26:42.802 --> 26:44.203
and we can watch the sunset!

26:54.681 --> 26:57.416
- Yara, how much hiking
is that going to involve?

26:57.449 --> 26:58.651
- Oh, not so much.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.119
- Do you think it's
wise for Lizzie

27:00.119 --> 27:02.789
to do this much exercise
so late in her pregnancy?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.791
I had thought all of
this would be more

27:04.791 --> 27:06.558
on the relaxing side.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.761
- Oh, um,

27:09.962 --> 27:11.764
I mean, if she's in
any kind of discomfort

27:11.764 --> 27:13.399
we can just head back?

27:13.432 --> 27:15.334
- Just bear in mind, okay?

27:19.772 --> 27:24.777
- I'll tell you about it later.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.215
- You okay?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.016
You need a minute?

28:04.050 --> 28:05.551
- Hang on, wait.

28:05.551 --> 28:09.722
- Hey guys, you carry on
going, we'll catch up.

28:09.722 --> 28:10.957
- You sure?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.424
- Yeah, sure, we'll
meet you at the top.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.392
- Okay!

28:13.392 --> 28:14.326
Yeah, we'll just wait up here.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.094
Yeah, sure thing.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.366
- I hope they're okay.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.644
I'm just getting the weirdest
cravings at the moment.

28:33.746 --> 28:36.749
Waffles, but drenched in lemon.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.920
I don't even know why, but
God if someone gave them

28:40.920 --> 28:42.088
to me just now, I'd-

28:43.589 --> 28:45.091
- Have some water.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.933
You know, if this
hike's getting too much,

28:53.966 --> 28:56.936
we can just head back to the
camp and have a chill day.

28:56.936 --> 28:57.736
It's cool.

28:58.604 --> 28:59.972
- I think Yara would flip.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.041
- Oh, who cares
what Yara thinks.

29:03.475 --> 29:06.212
I'm just saying, if it's
too much we can head back.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.046
- Thanks.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.187
So?

29:16.722 --> 29:17.523
- So?

29:17.556 --> 29:18.724
- So, did you tell her?

29:21.227 --> 29:22.962
- Lizzie, why does
every conversation

29:22.962 --> 29:25.131
with you recently head
back to a discussion point?

29:25.164 --> 29:27.533
- 'Cause I think it's
important and you'll regret it

29:27.533 --> 29:28.334
if you don't.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.705
- Well, I did say something.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.573
Happy?

29:38.677 --> 29:39.478
- And?

29:41.680 --> 29:42.681
- Christ!

29:44.350 --> 29:47.119
- I just said I didn't feel like

29:47.119 --> 29:50.289
she knew herself
properly, which is true.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.523
She doesn't.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.691
She hasn't given
herself the chance.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.228
She just brushes it under
a rug and doesn't face it.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.332
- Yeah, but did you
tell her how you feel?

30:02.201 --> 30:04.036
Because you know
that's what matters.

30:09.842 --> 30:10.642
- Ready?

30:15.481 --> 30:16.482
Come on, you.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.073
- We definitely need
a photo of this.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.275
- Oh, let me, let me take one.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.277
You four girls, you'll
want the memory.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.111
- Are you sure?

31:22.881 --> 31:23.815
- Line up, line up!

31:25.384 --> 31:26.585
Cheese!

31:26.652 --> 31:27.453
Another one?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.322
Wow.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.357
Oh, that's lovely.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.324
- Let me take a look, mum!

31:32.324 --> 31:35.127
- Of course, of course, look.

31:35.127 --> 31:36.428
- Ah, it's cute!

31:37.596 --> 31:39.631
- I cannot wait to
get those printed off,

31:39.665 --> 31:42.168
they're just gorgeous, oh wow.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.171
My baby.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.975
- Oh, guys, can we have one
with me and the bump up here?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.977
She's being-
- Could I be in one as well?

31:50.977 --> 31:54.046
- Yeah, yeah.

31:54.046 --> 31:54.846
Yeah.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.017
Yeah.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.120
- Case?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.090
I think we're gonna stay here
for a bit before we head off.

32:38.124 --> 32:41.093
For some reason, my map's not
matching up with the signs.

32:54.206 --> 32:55.007
- Guys,

32:56.575 --> 32:59.645
I, um, I hate to be the
one to say this, but, um,

32:59.645 --> 33:01.447
I think I'm gonna
have to head back.

33:01.447 --> 33:02.848
- Of course, Lizzie.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.450
To tell you the truth, I'm
surprised you've come this far.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.085
- Oh, no, I love days like this.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.553
It's just,

33:07.553 --> 33:09.855
when you've got a bun in the
oven, you're ready to pop.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.361
- I'll go with
Lizzie, you guys stay.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.563
- No, no, you go with the girls.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.431
- I'm not leaving you.

33:19.465 --> 33:20.966
- No, go and take photos.

33:20.966 --> 33:22.434
I'll just chill, it's fine.

33:23.602 --> 33:26.405
- See you later.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.239
- Bye.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.608
- Bye.
- Yeah, see you later,

33:29.641 --> 33:30.476
have a nice time.

33:54.466 --> 33:57.336
- These creatures are not
known for their polite manners.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.082
I need to put a stop to
this, once and for all.

35:25.123 --> 35:29.161
- Bless you, Carly, making
mummy need a wee all the time.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.404
- I know.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.606
- I told you that
you'd like that,

36:17.443 --> 36:19.245
- That's odd.

36:19.278 --> 36:21.613
- In the middle of the woods?

36:21.647 --> 36:22.481
- Mum!

36:22.481 --> 36:23.282
Yara!

36:25.451 --> 36:26.885
- Come on, they'll take ages.

37:18.169 --> 37:19.305
Anybody there?

37:20.472 --> 37:22.040
- I don't think
there's anyone in.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.846
- Hey guys,

37:27.846 --> 37:29.315
Can we check it out?

37:29.315 --> 37:31.617
- Girls, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

37:41.793 --> 37:42.594
- It's open.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.466
Oh, Jesus!

37:47.533 --> 37:48.567
What is that smell?

37:49.535 --> 37:50.469
- That's gross.

38:10.389 --> 38:11.189
- Hello?

38:22.434 --> 38:23.234
Ava?

38:42.588 --> 38:43.389
Hello?

38:53.198 --> 38:56.368
I'm gonna call the
police in a minute.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.322
- Where are your friends?

39:18.557 --> 39:20.559
I told you not to
come into these woods.

42:42.761 --> 42:46.064
- Guys, I don't think
we should be here.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.693
- Something isn't right here.

43:16.094 --> 43:21.066
We need to go.

43:22.868 --> 43:23.869
- Oh my God.

43:26.805 --> 43:27.605
- Mum!

43:30.008 --> 43:31.476
- I got out.

43:36.081 --> 43:40.551
These woods, it
knows them so well.

43:41.486 --> 43:43.855
You, you gotta help me.

43:43.889 --> 43:45.891
Help me get out of here,

43:45.924 --> 43:48.694
I've been running for ages.

43:48.694 --> 43:50.696
- Who are you running from?

43:50.729 --> 43:52.030
- The beast.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.732
It captured us.

43:53.765 --> 43:54.565
- Who's us?

43:55.934 --> 43:57.769
- Me and my boyfriend.

43:57.803 --> 44:00.171
It captured us while
we were in the woods.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.639
Now, really, we've
got to go, please.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.441
- You're upset.
- No, we really need to go.

44:03.474 --> 44:04.275
No, please!

44:04.309 --> 44:05.110
We really need to go!

44:05.176 --> 44:06.845
No, no, we need to go!

44:06.845 --> 44:07.645
No!

44:22.360 --> 44:23.361
- Get down!

44:23.361 --> 44:24.162
Get down!

44:28.199 --> 44:29.000
- Yara!

44:36.107 --> 44:36.908
Yara!

44:37.809 --> 44:38.609
- Ava!

44:38.643 --> 44:39.711
Ava, help me!

44:40.912 --> 44:41.713
Get her up!

45:01.767 --> 45:03.835
- No, no, no, no, no, no,

45:06.237 --> 45:07.806
Please, no, no, no!

45:10.208 --> 45:13.011
Please, no, please,
no please, no!

45:19.550 --> 45:21.352
No, no, no, no.

45:27.826 --> 45:29.027
- Keep going!

45:29.094 --> 45:29.895
Run!

45:32.931 --> 45:33.731
Quick!

46:10.468 --> 46:11.402
- It's okay.

46:11.402 --> 46:14.272
Okay, deep breathes, okay?

46:14.305 --> 46:15.473
Bear the pain.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.309
Okay?

46:19.310 --> 46:21.679
Shh, breathe, you're fine!

46:21.679 --> 46:22.480
It's okay.

46:24.049 --> 46:25.216
Look at me, look
at me, you're fine.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.017
All right?

46:30.755 --> 46:34.492
- These woods, you need to
know them well to get out.

46:36.928 --> 46:37.728
- Yara,

46:38.763 --> 46:39.664
she had the map.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.204
- It's okay, I think we
just keep heading this way,

46:46.204 --> 46:47.272
I think I remember it.

46:48.773 --> 46:50.208
- And what if you don't?

46:50.241 --> 46:53.811
What if she's right
and, and we get lost

46:53.811 --> 46:56.081
and we end up back
at that cabin?

46:56.081 --> 46:59.851
- I know, it's this
way, just trust me.

47:03.121 --> 47:04.655
- Oh my God.

47:04.689 --> 47:05.756
- What is it?

47:07.325 --> 47:08.626
- Fuck!
- Lizzie.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.130
- Yara had the car keys!

47:12.163 --> 47:13.431
- We keep running.
- Mum!

47:15.200 --> 47:17.602
You can't run any further
than that campsite

47:17.635 --> 47:19.437
and it's still a mile off, shit!

47:21.006 --> 47:22.240
We need those keys.

47:23.308 --> 47:24.775
- I'll go.

47:24.809 --> 47:28.013
I'll get the keys and I'll
meet you back at the campsite.

47:28.947 --> 47:29.747
- No.

47:31.216 --> 47:34.085
Ava, you seem to be the only
one who even knows the way back

47:34.085 --> 47:35.353
to the campsite.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.523
It doesn't make any
sense if you go.

47:38.523 --> 47:39.891
- Well, I don't know
what to suggest.

47:39.925 --> 47:40.992
We need those keys.

47:43.628 --> 47:44.562
- I'll go.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.032
- Casey, no, no honey, no, no-

47:48.233 --> 47:50.868
- Mum, mum, shh-
- Please, no, no!

47:50.936 --> 47:51.736
- Think about it, look-

47:51.769 --> 47:53.238
- Oh, God!

47:53.238 --> 47:56.007
- I can get back there, I
can find the keys, the map,

47:57.108 --> 47:58.109
and then I'll get myself back.

47:58.176 --> 47:59.644
Look, look,

47:59.644 --> 48:00.545
Ava will take you back to
the campsite, all right?

48:00.611 --> 48:02.013
I'm not gonna be far behind you.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.316
Lizzie, she's on her own.

48:05.316 --> 48:06.151
She's not safe!

48:06.217 --> 48:07.385
- Well, neither are you!

48:08.853 --> 48:12.057
- If we want to get out of
here, we've got to do this.

48:13.591 --> 48:17.162
- That thing, its face,

48:18.429 --> 48:20.631
that thing was a troll.

48:22.067 --> 48:23.001
- A troll?

48:23.001 --> 48:25.436
What, like the urban legend?

48:25.470 --> 48:28.673
- They are reputed
to live near caves,

48:28.706 --> 48:30.841
they hunt in the
woodland for prey

48:30.841 --> 48:32.843
to bring back to their families.

48:49.694 --> 48:50.495
- Go.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.198
Take my mum.

48:53.198 --> 48:54.165
Get out of here.

48:55.666 --> 48:57.135
- Hurry back to us.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.852
Okay, just, just hold on.

49:51.889 --> 49:53.391
Just a tiny bit further.

49:59.164 --> 49:59.964
- Oh God.

50:02.267 --> 50:03.068
Oh no.

50:08.373 --> 50:09.174
Oh God.

50:10.975 --> 50:11.976
- Stay with Keeley.

50:40.771 --> 50:42.640
- Do you see her?

50:42.640 --> 50:43.441
Lizzie?

50:52.883 --> 50:54.452
- She's not there.

50:54.452 --> 50:55.720
- Oh, thank God.

50:58.456 --> 50:59.590
- The troll's been here,

51:00.825 --> 51:01.959
We need to go.

51:24.815 --> 51:25.850
Hold my hand.

51:49.006 --> 51:49.807
- No!

51:49.840 --> 51:51.409
Run!

51:51.442 --> 51:52.243
Run!

52:00.185 --> 52:02.387
- Get off me!
- No!

52:02.387 --> 52:04.389
Get off me!

53:07.084 --> 53:10.788
- It won't stop
until it gets us.

53:16.561 --> 53:19.430
- How long were you down there?

53:19.430 --> 53:20.231
- I don't know.

53:21.366 --> 53:22.800
I lost track of days.

53:24.802 --> 53:28.273
I counted five, then I
don't know after that.

53:31.075 --> 53:32.877
- What did it do
to you In that hut?

53:34.078 --> 53:37.114
- It made me live as
some kind of slave.

53:39.149 --> 53:41.752
Tied me down,

53:41.786 --> 53:45.390
Beat me like a dog into
obeying its instructions.

53:46.824 --> 53:50.395
It would eat rodents,
and make me eat too.

53:52.830 --> 53:56.601
Some kind of eating ritual
where it made us compete

53:56.601 --> 53:58.403
for who finished first.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.876
- We're gonna wait here
until Casey comes back

54:05.876 --> 54:06.677
with those keys.

54:07.878 --> 54:09.614
And then we're gonna get
so far away from here,

54:09.647 --> 54:11.849
and we're never gonna look back.

54:16.354 --> 54:19.524
We're gonna get out
before we're gone.

54:28.232 --> 54:30.601
- Please, please,
no, no, please,

54:31.469 --> 54:32.269
Please!

54:34.004 --> 54:35.005
Please!

54:42.513 --> 54:43.814
Please!

55:29.994 --> 55:30.928
No, please!

55:35.600 --> 55:36.801
Please!

55:36.834 --> 55:39.737
I'll go back with
you, all right?

55:39.770 --> 55:40.805
I'll go back!

56:37.795 --> 56:39.296
- You tricked her.

58:35.079 --> 58:35.880
- Lizzie?

58:37.648 --> 58:40.150
- There's something
in the woods.

58:40.150 --> 58:41.752
It's picking us off.

58:41.786 --> 58:42.720
One by one.

58:45.255 --> 58:47.625
- We have to get you
back to the campsite.

58:47.625 --> 58:48.759
- No.

58:48.759 --> 58:49.560
No.

58:51.729 --> 58:53.931
That's where it got me.

58:53.931 --> 58:54.999
- The others,

58:56.801 --> 58:59.036
they're heading back there.

59:18.923 --> 59:19.724
Shh.

59:58.528 --> 59:59.329
- Casey.

1:00:37.234 --> 1:00:38.035
Casey!

1:01:10.835 --> 1:01:11.635
- Casey.

1:01:31.756 --> 1:01:32.556
- Lizzie.

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:52.176
- Oh, fuck.

1:01:52.176 --> 1:01:53.110
No, not now!

1:01:54.244 --> 1:01:55.045
Not now!

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.317
Oh, fuck, not now.

1:02:11.195 --> 1:02:12.963
- Stay away from her!

1:02:13.998 --> 1:02:15.032
- Get away from me!

1:02:23.273 --> 1:02:24.074
- Lizzie!

1:03:50.694 --> 1:03:51.495
- My baby!

1:03:53.230 --> 1:03:54.031
My baby!

1:03:55.765 --> 1:03:56.967
Don't take her!

1:03:59.603 --> 1:04:01.005
Give back my baby!

1:04:10.447 --> 1:04:11.248
- No!

1:05:28.825 --> 1:05:31.161
- The keys, I'm trying to...

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:35.932
- No.
- Fuck.

1:05:38.935 --> 1:05:40.137
The keys,

1:05:40.170 --> 1:05:42.306
I dropped them, I was
trying to cut the rope.

1:05:46.510 --> 1:05:48.078
Do you think she's okay?

1:05:50.247 --> 1:05:51.681
- I think she's just resting.

1:05:55.085 --> 1:05:57.887
We need to get the baby

1:05:57.887 --> 1:06:00.690
and Lizzie out of here
and to the hospital.

1:06:02.192 --> 1:06:04.161
- Where's my mum,
the other girl?

1:06:09.366 --> 1:06:10.434
- No, no, no.

1:06:17.007 --> 1:06:18.808
- Casey, I'm here.

1:06:18.842 --> 1:06:19.643
I'm here.

1:06:21.211 --> 1:06:22.012
- No, no.

1:06:24.948 --> 1:06:26.350
- I know, I know.

1:06:30.254 --> 1:06:32.256
But we've got to
be strong, okay?

1:06:35.325 --> 1:06:37.527
We have to get out of here.

1:06:39.996 --> 1:06:42.199
- We're never
getting out of here.

1:06:42.199 --> 1:06:43.267
- Yes we are.

1:06:45.735 --> 1:06:46.603
Look at me.

1:06:50.407 --> 1:06:51.208
I nev,

1:06:53.577 --> 1:06:56.046
I never wanted you to marry Tim

1:06:57.614 --> 1:07:02.519
'cause I felt like he
got in there first.

1:07:06.490 --> 1:07:10.094
And I felt like I'd never
get my chance with you.

1:07:11.828 --> 1:07:14.030
And every time we kissed,

1:07:15.799 --> 1:07:19.136
every time we accidentally
hooked up at a party,

1:07:21.238 --> 1:07:24.474
I knew it was more, and
I think we both did.

1:07:26.176 --> 1:07:28.278
We were just too
ashamed to admit it.

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:37.154
I'm sorry.

1:07:37.187 --> 1:07:39.756
I'm sorry that I'm saying
all of this now, but,

1:07:39.756 --> 1:07:41.191
now you know,

1:07:41.225 --> 1:07:43.760
and now I can live the life
I was supposed to live.

1:07:45.629 --> 1:07:47.631
It gives me even more
of a reason to want

1:07:47.631 --> 1:07:48.798
to get out of here.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:53.270
- Ava, I-

1:07:53.337 --> 1:07:55.038
- You don't have to
answer right now,

1:07:56.806 --> 1:07:58.842
But you do have to
fight this, okay?

1:08:00.310 --> 1:08:01.111
Not just for you.

1:08:02.212 --> 1:08:07.217
For me.

1:08:54.731 --> 1:08:56.032
- I don't wanna.

1:09:00.036 --> 1:09:01.104
No, I don't...

1:09:11.348 --> 1:09:13.517
I'm not fucking eating it!

1:09:21.024 --> 1:09:22.526
I'm not eating it.

1:09:46.416 --> 1:09:48.051
- Get away from her!

1:09:49.185 --> 1:09:50.086
Stop, stop!

1:10:09.673 --> 1:10:10.474
- Okay?

1:10:10.507 --> 1:10:11.441
Come on.

1:10:11.441 --> 1:10:12.276
We'll come back for them.

1:10:12.309 --> 1:10:13.243
Come on.

1:10:42.171 --> 1:10:45.275
- We're not gonna leave Lizzie.

1:10:45.275 --> 1:10:47.243
- We'll come back, okay?

1:12:11.094 --> 1:12:12.228
- Wait!

1:12:12.228 --> 1:12:13.029
Lizzie!

1:12:13.096 --> 1:12:14.130
We can't leave her!

1:12:14.163 --> 1:12:15.632
- We're not.

1:12:15.632 --> 1:12:17.401
We're going to get the car,
we'll come back for them,

1:12:17.401 --> 1:12:18.835
all right?

1:12:18.868 --> 1:12:20.537
We've got better odds
with speed on that thing.

1:12:21.405 --> 1:12:23.039
- Wait,

1:12:23.072 --> 1:12:23.873
that church,

1:12:27.310 --> 1:12:28.712
that priest said,

1:12:29.913 --> 1:12:33.917
something about an organ
and how it can stop it.

1:12:36.453 --> 1:12:38.455
Maybe this is what
he was talking about.

1:12:40.189 --> 1:12:41.290
- Go to the church.

1:12:42.225 --> 1:12:43.960
- And trap it inside.

1:13:45.922 --> 1:13:47.156
- Ava, come on!

1:13:53.162 --> 1:13:53.963
Ava!

1:13:55.031 --> 1:13:55.832
- My back!

1:14:00.236 --> 1:14:01.871
- Come on, come on!

1:14:01.905 --> 1:14:04.508
I think we lost it, I
think we lost it, okay?

1:14:04.574 --> 1:14:06.510
But we've got to get
to the church, okay?

1:14:06.510 --> 1:14:08.612
We've got to keep
going, all right?

1:14:08.645 --> 1:14:09.546
Okay?

1:14:09.546 --> 1:14:11.615
Come on, come on, you ready?

1:14:23.827 --> 1:14:24.628
Come on!

1:14:59.362 --> 1:15:00.163
You okay?

1:15:01.731 --> 1:15:02.532
- I'm fine.

1:15:06.235 --> 1:15:07.270
- Promise me?

1:15:10.707 --> 1:15:11.507
- Promise.

1:15:18.882 --> 1:15:21.918
- I, I thought I
lost you back there.

1:15:29.993 --> 1:15:31.561
- You still got me.

1:15:37.801 --> 1:15:38.602
- Good.

1:15:40.870 --> 1:15:41.971
I'll trap it inside.

1:15:44.908 --> 1:15:46.910
- What if it doesn't want to go?

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:54.150
- You can help me.

1:15:55.484 --> 1:15:56.953
You run like hell.

1:15:58.487 --> 1:16:00.189
- I'm not leaving you.

1:16:29.518 --> 1:16:31.554
I'll meet you at the car.

1:17:55.071 --> 1:17:56.172
Please, Case,

1:17:58.241 --> 1:17:59.042
come on,

1:19:27.296 --> 1:19:28.097
- Now!

1:19:38.207 --> 1:19:39.008
Again!

1:19:39.042 --> 1:19:40.109
It's working, Ava!

1:19:40.109 --> 1:19:40.910
Again!

1:19:40.977 --> 1:19:41.744
It's working!

1:19:45.214 --> 1:19:46.015
Again!

1:19:53.356 --> 1:19:54.290
Ava, again!

1:20:03.566 --> 1:20:04.633
It's working!

1:20:39.602 --> 1:20:40.403
Come on!

1:21:11.400 --> 1:21:13.736
- We're gonna go get Lizzie.

1:21:17.806 --> 1:21:19.575
- It's gonna be okay.

1:22:00.849 --> 1:22:03.552
- Let's get the
hell out of here.
