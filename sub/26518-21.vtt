00:15.349 --> 00:18.467
Turn around.
Slowly.

00:22.940 --> 00:24.101
I did what you wanted.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.727
I got it.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.858
So, this is over, right?
I'm done?

00:32.573 --> 00:34.031
Oh, no.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.528
We're just
getting started.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.930
It's good to have you
on our side.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.911
- I never said that I...
- You're doing fine.

00:38.997 --> 00:41.364
Just live your life,
act as if nothing happened,

00:41.458 --> 00:43.199
and I'll call you
when we need you.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.219
Wow!

00:56.306 --> 00:58.138
Your coloring skills
have improved.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.137
Ha!
Very funny.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.934
Mm-hmm.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.261
Bethany gave that to me

01:03.355 --> 01:04.595
before she flew back
with Allie.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.685
The weekend went by
way too fast.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.438
And as crowded
as it was...

01:09.528 --> 01:11.770
I kinda missed
having that little one

01:11.863 --> 01:14.526
snuggling between us all night.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.198
It was so nice
being a family again.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.285
Yeah.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.702
Even with all those little
karate kicks to my face.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.279
Why do kids always

01:21.373 --> 01:22.454
end up sleeping
sideways?

01:22.541 --> 01:23.748
I don't know.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.395
Well, if she doesn't
make it as an artist,

01:25.419 --> 01:27.285
she might have a future
as an MMA fighter.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.915
- Hmm.
- We're really lucky, aren't we?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.962
Eh, Reade's got
something for me.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.342
- Okay.
- I gotta go.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.718
Oh...

01:46.690 --> 01:49.524
And, yes, we are.
Very lucky.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.727
- Mm.
- I love you.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.103
Love you too.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.315
Hey.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.525
We were just
finishing up.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.905
Special Agent Weller.

01:59.995 --> 02:02.362
I'll leave you to, uh,
enjoy your chat.

02:02.456 --> 02:03.992
Got a million things
to do anyway.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.664
I got an alert
that you went to visit

02:05.751 --> 02:07.208
Eleanor Hirst in prison,

02:07.294 --> 02:09.627
and you were gunning
to get her a better cell.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.375
Wanna tell me why
you were making deals

02:11.465 --> 02:12.692
with the disgraced
former FBI director

02:12.716 --> 02:14.173
without my knowledge?

02:14.259 --> 02:15.591
You haven't figured out yet

02:15.677 --> 02:19.341
that I was replaced by someone
just as duplicitous?

02:19.431 --> 02:25.553
Well, um, Hirst had worked
for Crawford and HCI Global.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.639
I wanted to see if she could help
us take down Madeline Burke.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.439
I had to offer her
something in return.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.925
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.694
He came to me and I said yes.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.194
Seemed like a good deal
for us if it panned out.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.570
Unfortunately it didn't.
Way it goes sometimes.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.323
Why didn't you
bring this to me?

02:42.412 --> 02:44.699
Look,
Assistant Director,

02:44.790 --> 02:46.670
this was an action taken
by Special Agent Weller

02:46.750 --> 02:48.116
with my full knowledge
and consent.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.076
So, can we stop wasting
each other's time

02:50.170 --> 02:52.503
and focus on stopping
Madeline Burke's plan,

02:52.589 --> 02:53.875
whatever that is?

02:57.386 --> 02:58.386
Okay.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.389
Patterson's got something.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.017
All right.
You comin'?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.663
Uh, I actually need
a second with Weller,

03:06.687 --> 03:09.145
so... I'll see you in there.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.398
I'll meet you in there.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.700
You went to go talk to Eleanor
Hirst to get dirt on me?

03:22.786 --> 03:25.870
Yes, I did.
And I found it.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.367
Well, that is hurtful.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.198
And now Reade's
all suspicious.

03:29.292 --> 03:33.127
We, um... we don't have
a problem, do we?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.079
The truth is,
you used a drone to kill him

03:35.173 --> 03:36.254
so it wouldn't expose you.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.458
It would be a real shame
if the world found out

03:38.552 --> 03:40.339
that Jane Doe is
a former terrorist.

03:40.429 --> 03:43.217
No.
No problem.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.298
Okay, good.
That's great.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.760
One thing that
you should know.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.312
I'm not gonna let you
destroy this team.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.640
Ooh, I gotta take this.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.142
Go for Weitz.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.943
Yeah, thanks
for calling me back.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.448
Dominic Masters and Barry Wallace.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.571
Two known associates
of Madeline's.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.097
Well, you say known associates,
I say evil henchmen.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.121
Tomato, "tomahto."

04:07.205 --> 04:08.616
And the two people

04:08.707 --> 04:10.601
who could reveal Madeline's
plan, codenamed Helios,

04:10.625 --> 04:12.457
- are still in the wind.
- Great!

04:12.544 --> 04:13.830
Well, thanks for
letting me know.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.082
Okay. Okay.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.173
Okay.

04:17.214 --> 04:18.250
Okay, bye.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.707
All right, I'm here.
Hit me.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.882
You want us to start over?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.086
Maybe just gimme
the CliffsNotes.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.388
But, between us,
I could use some good news.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.090
I've got a thing today.
No big.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.720
Actually, huge big.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.413
Let's just...
we'll call it an opportunity.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.520
But, you know,
give me what ya got.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.347
Dazzle me.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.307
Madeline is in jail,
her goons aren't,

04:36.401 --> 04:38.267
and we still don't know
what Helios is.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.477
Ta-dah.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.153
Come on, I need...
I need a win today.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.606
- You need a win?
- We... need it.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.909
All of us... in America.

04:47.662 --> 04:48.765
Your opportunity
wouldn't have

04:48.789 --> 04:50.224
anything to do with
the White House's

04:50.248 --> 04:52.435
search for a new Director of
National Intelligence, would it?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.437
Let's just
say that by the end of today,

04:54.461 --> 04:57.499
I could be a skosh
closer to the President.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.922
Maybe, if what
you're saying is true.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.499
Not saying it is.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.209
What do we know
about Helios?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.295
Besides him being
a Greek god of the sun.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.699
After spending several hours
going down

05:06.723 --> 05:09.181
a pretty serious
magical chariot-related

05:09.267 --> 05:11.350
rabbit hole and learning,
among other things,

05:11.436 --> 05:14.804
the names of the
titular deity's four horses...

05:14.898 --> 05:16.855
Pyrois, Aeos, Aethon,
and Phlegon, by the way...

05:16.942 --> 05:18.524
uh, no.
No luck at all.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.317
Dominic and Barry
are still our best bet

05:20.403 --> 05:22.144
at stopping whatever
Madeline's up to.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.320
So we need to find them.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.899
We just got a lock
on Barry Wallace!

05:26.993 --> 05:28.655
Hey, looks like
the troubled transition

05:28.745 --> 05:30.281
to our new
inter-departmental database

05:30.372 --> 05:32.099
- was actually worth it.
- Yeah, look at that.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.363
I'm like a lucky rabbit's foot!

05:33.416 --> 05:35.353
- I walk in, boom! You get answers.
- Yeah.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.257
Also, the database did
what it's supposed to do.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.794
Eh, you're welcome.
So, where is he?

05:38.880 --> 05:41.668
Uh... at a house in Queens.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.294
Let's move.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.531
Reade and I got the back.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.555
You two take the front.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.221
Copy.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.733
On my count.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.310
Three.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.733
Go!

06:04.823 --> 06:06.485
FBI!

06:06.575 --> 06:07.408
FBI!

06:07.409 --> 06:08.695
- On the ground!
- On the ground!

06:08.785 --> 06:10.263
Stay down.
Hands behind your back.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.574
Give me your hand.
Barry's secure.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.791
Keaton?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.664
Oh, what the hell
are you guys doin'?!

06:18.753 --> 06:19.856
I got a better question.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.872
What the hell is
a CIA Officer doing here

06:21.965 --> 06:24.207
with a known associate
of Madeline Burke?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.432
Like I told you the
first twenty times,

06:41.610 --> 06:44.148
I got nothing to say
to any of you.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.149
So...

06:46.239 --> 06:47.946
Afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.033
You're funny.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.761
Let's see if you're still
laughing after I put you...

06:50.785 --> 06:52.276
Zapata.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.486
- Keaton.
- Yeah?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.321
Have a word?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.438
You want to tell me
why you're really here?

07:00.462 --> 07:02.670
Okay, so I...
I still monitor

07:02.756 --> 07:04.998
some old CIA
communications protocols.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.051
I got a hit when someone started
using them again,

07:07.135 --> 07:09.127
but I couldn't
decipher the messages.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.860
I followed the source
and I ended up here.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.047
And it just
happens to be

07:12.140 --> 07:13.722
one of Madeline's
main operatives?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.390
Are you accusing me
of something?

07:15.477 --> 07:16.843
Should we be?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.432
Look, I just got here
a few minutes ago.

07:19.522 --> 07:20.763
Right before he got home.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.439
I had no idea
who I was gonna find.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.378
I certainly didn't think
it was gonna be this guy.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.859
Wait, you two know
each other?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.153
Yeah.
But his real name's

07:27.238 --> 07:29.446
not Barry Wallace,
it's Barry Cornyn.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.569
Well, that explains
why he was so hard to trace.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.763
- How do you know him?
- Well, he might be Madeline's now,

07:33.787 --> 07:36.200
but he used to be CIA
through-and-through.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.700
Till he went rogue
and started

07:37.791 --> 07:39.908
selling his skills
to the highest bidder.

07:40.585 --> 07:44.204
Well, this is exciting!
Good work, everybody.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.334
Oh, what the hell
are you doin' here?

07:46.424 --> 07:47.756
Oh, good to see you, too.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.959
I just came to make sure
everything ran smoothly.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.294
What do we got?

07:51.388 --> 07:53.050
Well, Barry here
was about to spill

07:53.139 --> 07:55.882
until their flashbangs almost
sent me back into another coma.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.639
Well, to what do
we owe the pleasure

07:58.728 --> 08:00.094
of the Bureau's company, hmm?

08:00.188 --> 08:02.225
Hey, there ya are.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.307
Aren't I just the most popular
girl in school?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.643
Lucas Nash.
You're here because...?

08:06.736 --> 08:09.069
'Cause I called him
before you guys showed.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.236
Nash has history
with Barry.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.531
I trained him.
Unfortunately.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.297
Well, thank you both
for loosening the jar,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.222
but the FBI would now like
to take our friend here

08:16.246 --> 08:18.265
back to the office
for a little pleasant conversation.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.622
- We will send the CIA a full report.
- No.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.871
I got here first.
I'm takin' him.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.499
No, you're not.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.705
He's ours.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.290
You wanna go to war
over this?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.091
Gentlemen, please,
please, please.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.322
Look, it's clear we've reached
a jurisdictional impasse.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.587
Might I propose
a neutral location?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.674
We can all interrogate
Barry together? Hmm?

08:37.767 --> 08:39.787
The sooner we ask questions,
the sooner we get answers.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.496
The sooner we add a checkmark
in the "win" column.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.999
- Good with me.
- All right, I'll go with Weller...

08:43.023 --> 08:44.935
Actually, I'm gonna go
with Weller.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.420
Why would you even
get your hands dirty

08:47.444 --> 08:48.504
with this interrogation?
I'll see everybody

08:48.528 --> 08:50.394
back at the office.
Let's move!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.605
I've always wanted to say that.
That was fun.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.031
Walk.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.115
What's up with Weitz and Weller?
Everything okay?

08:59.706 --> 09:02.323
No. I don't think it is.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.035
Welcome back.

09:06.129 --> 09:08.166
We've got
some good news

09:08.256 --> 09:10.122
and some utterly
horrifying news.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.752
Should we wait for Weller?

09:11.843 --> 09:14.085
No, he and Weitz went with
Keaton to interrogate Barry.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.448
When did Weitz
start doing fieldwork?

09:15.472 --> 09:16.949
Just tell me you got
something off Barry's cell.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.464
Well, that's the good news.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.346
Last time we intercepted
Dominic's coded communications,

09:21.436 --> 09:23.177
we were able to crack
his cipher.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.139
We used the same one to decrypt
the message on Barry's phone.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.752
We were able to intercept
this text from Barry

09:27.776 --> 09:29.358
shortly before
the raid today.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.980
"We on?"

09:31.071 --> 09:33.233
Yeah, I guess "U up?"
is a little overused.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.689
And Barry responded,

09:34.783 --> 09:36.820
not with an eggplant emoji
but with this...

09:36.910 --> 09:39.072
and this is where
the bad news comes in.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.246
"Retrieving virus at 1200.
Will be ready for today."

09:42.332 --> 09:43.601
Turns out,
when he was at the CIA,

09:43.625 --> 09:47.369
Barry's area of expertise...
His "Barea," if you will.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.454
...was chemical, biological,

09:49.547 --> 09:51.880
and, you guessed it,
viral attacks.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.673
Madeline has a history
of mass killings.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.279
It looks like she's using Barry's
background to up her game.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.966
Yeah, so this virus they're after
is part of her attack plan.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.056
Part of Helios.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.881
It looks that way,
but luckily,

10:00.975 --> 10:02.703
we caught Barry before
he was able to retrieve it.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.705
You know, if Madeline's plan
is to use a biological agent

10:04.729 --> 10:06.641
to kill God knows
how many people,

10:06.731 --> 10:08.571
she's not gonna let
a failed delivery stop her.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.835
She'll just find
somebody else to get it.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.128
Zapata, bring Madeline in.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.064
Let's see if we can
get her talking.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.423
Patterson, see if you can
figure out

10:14.447 --> 10:15.674
who's on the other side
of Barry's texts.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.690
And Rich, maybe you could use
the cell data

10:17.784 --> 10:19.845
so that we could figure out
any recent locations on him.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.055
Jane, can I talk
to you for a minute?

10:21.079 --> 10:23.116
Yeah. Of course.
What's going on?

10:24.624 --> 10:25.865
I was hoping
you could tell me.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.168
Um... You know I trust Kurt,
but I've been getting

10:29.254 --> 10:31.462
a weird vibe off him
and Weitz lately.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.130
Should I be worried?

10:33.216 --> 10:35.458
I just get the feeling that
they're workin' on something

10:35.552 --> 10:38.761
I don't know about.
Something serious.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.338
Would you know
anything about that?

10:41.850 --> 10:44.433
I don't expose him,
he doesn't expose you.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.061
It's a stalemate.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.641
No, but I'll...
I'll keep my eyes open.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.607
Thanks. I'm just
a little worried about him.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.188
I appreciate that.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.232
<i>So that's it.</i>

11:13.256 --> 11:14.358
<i>We'll call when
we have more info.</i>

11:14.382 --> 11:16.169
All right.
Thanks, Patterson.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.195
We'll update you once we get
something out of Barry.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.303
My God.
A weaponized virus.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.576
There could be a million targets
for something like that.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.512
That is not
what I needed today.

11:25.602 --> 11:26.871
Why do I get the feeling
that your worrying

11:26.895 --> 11:28.602
goes beyond concern
for the public?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.270
You know what?
I've been very up front

11:30.356 --> 11:32.001
about trying to kill
two birds with one stone here,

11:32.025 --> 11:34.642
so don't question my motives.
I should be questioning yours.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.568
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

11:36.654 --> 11:38.190
You know, your little visit
with Hirst

11:38.281 --> 11:39.943
almost got us in
a lot of trouble today.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.844
You were lucky I was there
to get you out of it.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.702
Wh... Get me out of it?
You got me into it.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.528
If you didn't fabricate
any evidence

11:46.623 --> 11:48.017
and use a drone strike
to cover it up...

11:48.041 --> 11:49.268
- No, no. No, no.
- ...we wouldn't be here.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.499
Your wife got you into it!

11:50.585 --> 11:52.201
Do not talk about my wife.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.786
She had a terrorist relapse

11:53.880 --> 11:56.122
and broke her mother
out of a black site.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.333
Hey, Weitz, this thing
that we're doing?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.713
It's not gonna end well,
for either of us.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.964
In my experience,

12:02.055 --> 12:03.717
secrets have a way
of coming out.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.262
Yeah, well you better
hope this one doesn't.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.431
For you and Jane.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.915
Okay, look.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.833
We both said some stuff.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.459
Let's just, you know, remember
that we're not enemies.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.006
We're on the same side here.
We both want the same things.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.130
No, we don't.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.461
I want to protect my wife.

12:43.554 --> 12:46.171
You just want to
look after yourself.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.258
When we're finished
interrogating Barry,

12:48.351 --> 12:50.217
you're done calling
shots for me.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.751
Uh, you're not actually
in a position

12:51.813 --> 12:53.020
to make that call, so...

13:06.452 --> 13:07.818
Wha... What the hell
are you doing?

13:07.912 --> 13:09.682
Hey! We're under attack!
Barry could be alive!

13:09.706 --> 13:11.447
We need him
to take down Madeline.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.304
Keaton!

13:25.388 --> 13:26.388
Go, go, go!

13:40.361 --> 13:42.603
They're all dead! What are you doin'?!
Let's go, let's go!

13:42.697 --> 13:44.563
Go, go!

13:45.992 --> 13:46.992
Go-go-go-go-go-go.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.488
Okay, so,
with Madeline's goon Barry

14:26.574 --> 14:29.658
scattered all over
the Cross Island Parkway,

14:29.744 --> 14:32.157
we lost our one lead
into what she might be up to.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.266
And besides knowing
that it involves an attack

14:34.290 --> 14:36.202
and that it's happening
somewhere today,

14:36.292 --> 14:38.158
we still don't know
what Helios is.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.646
Any luck tracing
Barry's whereabouts

14:39.670 --> 14:41.127
over the past 24 hours?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.233
- Uh, we're working on it.
- He really covered his tracks.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.998
Yeah, the CIA
trained him well.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.236
All right, let's focus

14:46.260 --> 14:48.593
on who Barry was getting
the virus from.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.295
And who's gonna pick it up
in his place.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.992
I'll see if I can figure out
who attacked the caravan.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.848
Speaking of caravan,
where the hell is Weitz?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.471
Figured he'd be
here for this.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.456
He and Nash are
figuring out the next steps,

14:57.480 --> 14:59.346
with the rest of
the intelligence community.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.772
He'll be here soon.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.208
Oh, what a day.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.635
This situation
is an utter disaster.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.713
For you in particular,
as I understand it.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.924
Well, I don't know about...
wait, you hear something?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.725
No.
Nothing specific.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.081
But the White House
is gonna want to have

15:39.105 --> 15:40.499
this Barry Wallace thing
sewn up before they make

15:40.523 --> 15:42.731
any final decisions
on the new appointments.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.104
Say, for Director
of National Intelligence.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.026
Ah, I almost died
in that attack.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.341
You don't think that's gonna
earn me some points upstairs?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.197
This situation
went very sideways

15:51.284 --> 15:52.525
under your direct watch.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.325
If it were me up
for this job,

15:54.412 --> 15:56.495
I'd be in the market for
a reason it wasn't my fault.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.621
Thanks, but I am not throwing
my team under the bus.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.290
I'm not suggesting you do.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.584
What, do you have
something else in mind?

16:41.709 --> 16:43.187
Looks like time in a jail cell

16:43.211 --> 16:44.497
does not agree with her.

16:44.587 --> 16:45.919
Good.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.399
No matter what
she looks like right now,

16:47.423 --> 16:48.817
she knows the only reason
she's here

16:48.841 --> 16:50.252
is 'cause she has
something we want.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.629
So, how are we
gonna play this?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.739
The clock's ticking.
We've gotta put the fear of God in her.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.301
Threaten her with more jail time,
more criminal charges.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.160
She's too smart for that.
We have to be methodical.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.141
She's right.
We tried going hard at her

17:00.228 --> 17:01.830
and it took forever to get
anything useful.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.999
Reade, this isn't the time to
go on a fishing expedition.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.459
I mean, Weitz,
he wants us to keep...

17:05.483 --> 17:07.691
Your boy Weitz is not
a part of this conversation.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.939
We do this my way.
Zapata and I got this.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.740
We have to come clean
about your deal with Weitz.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.140
Things have gotten
out of control.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.451
If I tell anyone about Weitz,

17:22.541 --> 17:24.704
he'll go public
with what you did as Remi.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.118
We could lose everything.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.752
Probably prison time,
or worse.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.673
I'm talkin' about
the whole team.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.171
Including Reade.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.345
Kurt, if they find out
and it's not from us,

17:36.430 --> 17:37.950
it's gonna make everything
so much worse.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.011
Let's just focus
on this win.

17:40.101 --> 17:43.310
If Weitz gets his precious
promotion, he gets outta here.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.353
The sooner he's gone...

17:45.439 --> 17:47.055
the sooner
this is all over.

17:48.609 --> 17:49.609
Okay?

17:56.284 --> 17:57.900
How you holding up,
Madeline?

17:59.495 --> 18:01.407
I'm in jail for crimes
I didn't commit.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.683
How do you think
I'm holdin' up?

18:02.707 --> 18:04.573
Well, in light
of your innocence,

18:04.667 --> 18:06.033
we're hoping you
could help us.

18:06.127 --> 18:07.959
We need you to tell us
everything you know...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.957
I can't believe
I'm in this position.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.339
I suppose I shouldn't
be surprised.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.634
History does have a way
of repeating itself, but...

18:17.722 --> 18:21.386
I dragged myself out of ruin
when my family was...

18:22.768 --> 18:25.727
I just didn't think
I'd have to do it again.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.768
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.724
How was it
supposed to be?

18:30.818 --> 18:33.652
For who?
Me or for my father?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.696
Your father?

18:36.782 --> 18:39.274
You didn't talk about him much
when I was around.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.281
It was a sore spot
with the family.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.557
Respected,
wealthy businessman.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.244
Powerful. Charismatic.
Headed for good things.

18:46.334 --> 18:47.916
- Mm.
- Then he lost all of his money

18:48.002 --> 18:49.243
and left public life.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.919
Died when you
were young, right?

18:51.672 --> 18:52.788
Did your homework.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.670
Yeah, but what does he
have to do with this?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.626
He was a titan.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.591
Did you know at one point,

19:00.681 --> 19:03.014
he was being groomed
for the presidency?

19:04.352 --> 19:08.312
Until the powers that be
had a change of heart.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.436
And they ruined him instead.

19:13.903 --> 19:18.364
Whole family.
Destroyed.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.782
That must have
been traumatic.

19:20.868 --> 19:24.657
So, you were reclaiming
your family's power.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.491
Are you sure your dad didn't
bring this on himself?

19:30.127 --> 19:31.584
There were a lot of rumors.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.065
And that's just what
they were, rumors.

19:33.089 --> 19:34.955
My father was innocent.

19:35.049 --> 19:37.041
Do you know what
innocent people do, Madeline?

19:37.134 --> 19:39.626
They cooperate.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.632
We need you to tell us
everything you know

19:41.722 --> 19:43.884
about Barry Wallace
and Dominic Masters.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.010
You help us, we help you.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.342
Always very direct,
Tasha.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.927
That's what
I liked about you.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.183
Until you betrayed me
just like all the others.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.390
You know, I'm not comfortable
going any further

19:53.484 --> 19:55.692
without my lawyer.
When Mr. Shirley arrives,

19:55.778 --> 20:00.648
I will do whatever I can...
to be of service.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.406
We got a hit on Dominic!

20:05.496 --> 20:07.408
He was caught on
a security camera at,

20:07.498 --> 20:09.740
wait for it...
Bellmore University.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.166
Ring any Bells... more?

20:11.252 --> 20:13.039
Wait, that's the same place
you and the CIA

20:13.129 --> 20:14.836
used as a cover for secret ops.

20:14.922 --> 20:15.982
That can't be a coincidence.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.840
It's not, the place used to be
a hotbed for CIA activity.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.009
It's where Barry
was recruited and trained.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.132
But there's not an Agency
presence there anymore.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.339
Yeah, that program was
closed down a few years ago.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.412
- As it should have been.
- Okay, well, check out this little tidbit of information.

20:28.436 --> 20:32.180
Barry's text said
"Retrieving virus at 1200."

20:32.273 --> 20:34.835
- He didn't mean noon.
- He meant Bellmore University, Building 1200.

20:34.859 --> 20:36.020
The science building.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.396
Bellmore's Bio-Science
department

20:37.486 --> 20:39.102
is one of the best
in the nation.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.632
So, if you wanted
to weaponize a virus,

20:40.656 --> 20:41.817
that'd be the place to start.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.569
And it looks like Barry
was cultivating

20:43.659 --> 20:46.367
his own on-campus assets,
even after leaving the Agency.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.490
Do we know who she is?

20:47.580 --> 20:48.640
We've been sorting
through footage

20:48.664 --> 20:50.184
from adjacent cams
trying to track her.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.831
Which is a lot harder
than you'd think.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.249
Apparently,
college kids all love

20:53.335 --> 20:55.918
wearing matching college merch.
Go, sports team!

20:56.005 --> 20:57.816
- When was this footage taken?
- Under an hour ago.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.672
They could both
still be in the area.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.153
When Reade gets out of interrogation,
can you tell Reade

21:01.177 --> 21:02.320
that we took the team
to Bellmore?

21:02.344 --> 21:03.505
Yeah, I'm coming too.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.132
Actually, we should
have a word.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.804
Okay, yeah, sure.
I'll catch up.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.427
Right.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.930
Madeline stonewalling you
pissing you off that much,

21:11.020 --> 21:12.511
or is something
else bothering you?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.125
What, this thing
with Weitz and Weller?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.464
I guess I'm just feeling
more and more

21:20.488 --> 21:22.007
cut off from the team.
Things are happening

21:22.031 --> 21:23.592
behind the scenes
that I don't know about.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.073
And I don't like it.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.946
Oh, it's lonely
being the boss.

21:27.578 --> 21:29.035
You may or may not
remember this,

21:29.121 --> 21:31.829
but not too long ago
I was an island, myself.

21:31.916 --> 21:35.000
But when I was out there
on my own,

21:35.085 --> 21:36.451
feeling a million
miles away,

21:36.545 --> 21:39.003
I just focused on the things
I knew were true in this world.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.669
The things I can count on.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.500
You're not alone, Reade.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.586
I've got you.
Always.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.181
You know that, right?

21:48.265 --> 21:50.507
I know.
Thanks.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.856
Where are you going?

22:01.946 --> 22:03.733
Malta, apparently.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.564
Just about as far
as the CIA can throw me.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.069
Malta?
What the hell's in Malta?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.650
My new "promotion."

22:08.744 --> 22:09.744
They're sidelining you?

22:09.829 --> 22:11.786
Oh, more like putting me
out to pasture.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.912
I guess the people upstairs
got a complaint about me

22:13.958 --> 22:15.415
from a "high-ranking official"

22:15.501 --> 22:18.869
and they think my skills
will be better used elsewhere.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.107
They're blaming you for
what happened with Barry?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.542
- That's right.
- Who? Nash?

22:22.633 --> 22:23.874
Oh, no. No.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.425
Your boss.
Weitz.

22:25.511 --> 22:29.255
"For operating outside
standard CIA protocols

22:29.348 --> 22:30.839
leading to the death
of a suspect

22:30.933 --> 22:33.050
- in an FBI investigation."
- That sounds like him.

22:33.143 --> 22:35.163
But something tells me
he didn't get that idea on his own.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.456
You know, when
I chose this life,

22:36.480 --> 22:37.707
I always knew there
was a chance

22:37.731 --> 22:38.959
I'd eventually get screwed over.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.270
I just never thought Nash
would be the one doing it.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.727
We have to fight this.
There's nothing to fight.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.564
This is the game, Zapata.
And I just got played.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.195
Look, if I were you two...

22:49.285 --> 22:50.651
I'd watch your backs.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.280
Meaning what?

22:52.371 --> 22:54.738
Meaning, keep an eye
on your people.

22:54.832 --> 22:56.915
Deputy Director
to Assistant Director...

22:57.001 --> 22:59.618
I think you've got some
foxes in your henhouse.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.374
Careful who you trust.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.079
You mean Weller
and Weitz?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.631
Like I said:
Watch your backs.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.589
Now if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go

23:08.679 --> 23:11.092
tell my family
about my promotion.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.427
- Good luck, man.
- Yeah, likewise.

23:13.517 --> 23:14.849
Yeah.

23:22.610 --> 23:26.820
Hey...
you just keep fightin', okay?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.444
This whole thing with Madeline?
You got this.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.750
You're lucky to have her,
you know that, right?

23:33.954 --> 23:34.954
I do.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.405
Good.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.455
All right, I'll see you
around the playground.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.547
What?

23:44.632 --> 23:45.964
Was that real?

23:46.050 --> 23:47.485
- What do you mean, "Was that real?"
- Because I've seen him

23:47.509 --> 23:50.092
pretend to fire you here before.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.407
Now, is this the same thing?
Am I getting played here, too?

23:52.431 --> 23:53.547
No.

23:53.641 --> 23:54.826
I swear to you,
as far as I know...

23:54.850 --> 23:55.966
Just with Weller,
and Weitz,

23:56.060 --> 23:57.642
and Keaton,
and Nash, I...

23:57.728 --> 23:59.956
- My head is spinning. I have no idea who to believe right now.
- Hey.

23:59.980 --> 24:02.188
I don't know what's
going on here either,

24:02.274 --> 24:04.357
but you can trust me 100 percent.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.643
Got it?

24:09.031 --> 24:10.112
All right.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.136
- Reade, I don't know...
- I... I got work to do.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.992
Let me know
if anything changes.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.630
- Yeah.
- I hope you were smart enough

24:35.724 --> 24:37.761
to get the hell away
from Bellmore University.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.217
The FBI will be there
any minute.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.927
- Oh, I'm long gone.
<i>- Good.</i>

24:41.021 --> 24:42.762
<i>And you should know,
I don't appreciate</i>

24:42.856 --> 24:44.250
your associates'
rather explosive approach

24:44.274 --> 24:45.355
to the work earlier.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.462
It was a miracle I wasn't
blown into a million pieces.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.977
You called us with
ten minutes' notice

24:49.071 --> 24:50.357
to take Barry
off the game board

24:50.447 --> 24:52.609
before he sold us out
to the FBI.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.282
We did our best
with the time we had.

24:54.368 --> 24:55.368
<i>You want some good news?</i>

24:55.452 --> 24:56.738
- Desperately.
<i>- I have the virus</i>

24:56.829 --> 24:58.320
and I'm moving into position.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.406
Helios is a go.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.836
Tell me you found Dominic
at Belmore.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.458
No luck.
He must have gotten the virus

25:08.549 --> 25:10.485
- before we showed up.
- Which means an attack could be imminent.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.778
I've updated local
law enforcement.

25:11.802 --> 25:12.904
They know to proceed
with caution.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.009
Any leads at Bellmore?

25:14.096 --> 25:15.337
We worked
with campus security

25:15.431 --> 25:16.950
to track down the woman
that Dominic met with.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.494
She's in
interrogation right now.

25:18.559 --> 25:19.595
Her name's Erin Sandler.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.267
And she's a PhD candidate

25:21.353 --> 25:24.096
at the university.
Biomedical science.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.647
- Tell me you know what her plan is.
- She's not talking.

25:26.734 --> 25:29.129
She must have used her access to
Bellmore's medical research facility

25:29.153 --> 25:30.564
to create the virus.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.424
You two take a run at
our college student here.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.408
See if you can figure out
where Dominic is headed.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.155
Dominic's already
got the virus, right?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.487
Now, Erin,
she could be a dead end.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.324
Madeline knows everything.
We gotta try her again.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.562
We have no play. She lawyered up
and the man isn't even here yet.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.578
We can't just sit around

25:47.671 --> 25:49.628
while he's draggin'
his feet coming in here.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.456
A million lives are on the line.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.736
We got to put pressure
on her now.

25:52.760 --> 25:55.719
And have everything she says
without counsel be inadmissible?

25:55.804 --> 25:56.844
Actually...

25:56.889 --> 25:58.346
as a former prosecutor,

25:58.432 --> 26:00.076
we might have a little
bit of wiggle room here.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.511
I saw the tape,
and Madeline

26:01.602 --> 26:03.138
doesn't actually ask
for her lawyer.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.706
She just says
she wouldn't be comfortable

26:04.730 --> 26:06.517
talking without
her lawyer present,

26:06.607 --> 26:09.691
which is a small
but important distinction.

26:10.611 --> 26:12.193
We need the answers.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.193
If we overreach,
we risk spooking her

26:16.283 --> 26:18.195
and then lose any chance
of her cooperation.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.651
Your objection
has been noted.

26:19.745 --> 26:21.862
Let's go.
Let's do it.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.996
I got an alert that you went to
visit Eleanor Hirst in prison.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.605
I wanted to see if she could help
us take down Madeline Burke.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.773
All right,
I'll go with Weller.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.149
Actually, I'm gonna go
with Weller.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.005
Like I said,
watch your backs.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.620
This is Assistant Director
Edgar Reade

26:43.644 --> 26:45.852
of the New York office
of the FBI.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.349
I need to speak
with a prisoner

26:47.439 --> 26:49.271
you have in your custody,
Eleanor Hirst.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.643
Well, then you make her available
and get back to me.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.859
I told you,
I can't say anything.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.968
Do you have any idea how many
crimes this man is wanted for?

26:58.992 --> 27:01.655
Murder. Conspiracy. Terrorism.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.452
Just associating with him
could make you

27:03.539 --> 27:05.371
an accessory to whatever
he's about to do.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.291
You are facing some serious
prison time right now, Erin.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.493
Why were you
meeting him?

27:09.586 --> 27:11.077
And what exactly
did you give him?

27:11.171 --> 27:12.457
- I can't tell you!
- Why not?

27:12.548 --> 27:14.961
Because it's above
your clearance.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.759
Clearance?

27:18.846 --> 27:20.553
What are you talking about?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.255
I'm working with the CIA.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.398
It's time
to start talking.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.191
I believe
we've already established

27:34.278 --> 27:36.065
my position regarding
my lawyer.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.646
Yeah.
We have.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.571
But he doesn't seem
to be racing in here.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.321
We both know that a lot of
innocent lives are in danger.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.827
So, what is Project Helios?

27:44.913 --> 27:46.996
I give up, what is it?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.789
This is not a game!

27:48.876 --> 27:50.287
Dominic Masters
is about to launch

27:50.377 --> 27:52.209
a biological attack
on this city.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.162
He's got his hands
on a virus

27:54.256 --> 27:56.373
that he could unleash
at any moment.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.902
So if you wanna
sit there and pretend

27:57.926 --> 28:00.043
you don't know anything
about it, fine!

28:00.137 --> 28:02.754
You do need
to help me stop him.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.133
I can certainly empathize
with your anxiety.

28:06.226 --> 28:10.470
And while a biological attack
is a terrifying prospect,

28:10.564 --> 28:12.726
I don't know
what I can do for you.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.808
You tell me where he is.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.064
I... I...
I wish I knew.

28:17.154 --> 28:18.986
Dominic Masters is
a frightening person,

28:19.072 --> 28:21.780
which is why I've long
since cut ties with him.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.280
If he kills
anyone today...

28:25.913 --> 28:27.324
it's all on you.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.578
Is that the man
who recruited you?

28:32.669 --> 28:35.207
He lied to you.
He's not CIA.

28:35.297 --> 28:38.005
But he showed me
his credentials, his ID.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.458
The CIA doesn't go around
giving out laminated IDs.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.214
Secrecy's kind of
their whole thing.

28:42.304 --> 28:44.512
No, but the...
things he said.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.180
The things he knew.
He had to be!

28:46.266 --> 28:49.054
Look, he used to be.
That is how he fooled you.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.144
Oh, my God.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.391
But since he was
discharged years ago,

28:52.481 --> 28:53.722
he's been doing
mercenary work

28:53.815 --> 28:56.182
for a string of terrible people.

28:56.276 --> 28:59.485
Please...
the virus you gave him...

28:59.571 --> 29:02.359
he's gonna use it today.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.406
Do you wanna help me
stop this attack or not?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.236
My father dedicated
his life to help others.

29:07.329 --> 29:09.662
It's all he cared about.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.449
So...
follow in his footsteps.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.294
Oh, I wish I could.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.997
To follow his example...

29:20.634 --> 29:22.170
Even after
he lost everything,

29:22.261 --> 29:24.218
after everything had been
stripped away from him,

29:24.304 --> 29:26.717
he went to church
every Sunday

29:26.807 --> 29:29.675
and put whatever he could
into the collection plate.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.055
So, this is your
collection plate.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.388
It is.
Right here, right now.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.520
He never stopped trying to
make the world a better place,

29:38.610 --> 29:40.602
even when he had
every reason to give up.

29:40.696 --> 29:42.437
Now, see,
that's what I wanted.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.567
To help people.

29:43.657 --> 29:44.898
So help me.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.611
I have no knowledge

29:49.705 --> 29:53.369
of what Dominic Masters
may or may not have planned.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.120
And I abhor the idea

29:55.210 --> 29:57.623
that anyone even
remotely connected to me

29:57.713 --> 30:00.000
could be capable
of such mayhem.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.297
Then give me something.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.253
I have been
racking my brain,

30:07.347 --> 30:09.339
and I think I remember

30:09.433 --> 30:12.176
Dominic Master's
private phone number.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.602
The last one he used
to call me, anyway.

30:17.607 --> 30:19.644
Fine.
So write it down.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.026
I'm doing this
for my father.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.610
I'm sure your dad would be
very proud of you.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.447
It's what
he would have wanted.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.289
So, every word Barry
told me was a lie?

30:42.382 --> 30:43.463
Yes.
And we think

30:43.550 --> 30:45.132
that the virus you gave
to his associate

30:45.218 --> 30:46.863
is gonna be used in
a massive biological attack

30:46.887 --> 30:47.887
on the East Coast.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.507
Wait.
Biological attack?

30:49.598 --> 30:51.840
That is what you
were doing for Barry?

30:51.933 --> 30:54.892
Getting him access into
Bellmore's bio-science lab?

30:54.978 --> 30:57.095
What? No.
I mean, I'm studying

30:57.189 --> 30:59.727
Biomedical Science now,
but I got my first degree

30:59.816 --> 31:02.058
in Computer Science.
That's my real passion.

31:02.152 --> 31:03.359
That's how he found me.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.061
You didn't give him a bio-virus.

31:05.155 --> 31:06.691
You gave him a computer virus.

31:06.782 --> 31:09.946
He told me that the CIA was
gonna use it as a study case,

31:10.035 --> 31:13.528
to try and figure out a way
to protect the country

31:13.622 --> 31:15.329
from the world's
most dangerous malware.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.998
In this case, the most
dangerous malware is...

31:18.085 --> 31:19.451
My program.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.412
Oh, I've done
a terrible thing.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.586
How bad is it?

31:29.679 --> 31:31.887
The virus Erin gave Dominic
is <i>muy destructivo.</i>

31:31.973 --> 31:34.090
Say you got a secure facility.
A prison.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.221
Military base.
Nuclear reactor.

31:36.311 --> 31:38.177
Yeah, just put it into
a physical access point

31:38.271 --> 31:39.432
and it cripples security,

31:39.523 --> 31:41.185
and then it goes to work
on the system.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.436
Giving your dastardly miscreant
total access

31:43.527 --> 31:44.768
to steal, use, or destroy

31:44.861 --> 31:46.589
whatever their shriveled
little heart desires.

31:46.613 --> 31:48.024
In short,
it is a nightmare.

31:48.115 --> 31:51.153
If this thing has the power
to destroy a nuclear reactor,

31:51.243 --> 31:53.155
we have to get it
out of Dominic's hands.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.908
Any luck tracking him with
the number Madeline gave us?

31:55.997 --> 31:57.642
We've been trying,
but the phone is turned off.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.409
We do have a workaround,
naturally.

32:00.502 --> 32:01.583
We can turn it on remotely,

32:01.670 --> 32:03.270
but it will take
a bit of time to get in,

32:03.338 --> 32:05.058
and there's probably only
gonna be one shot.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.693
Because he'll toss that phone as soon
as he knows that we got access to it.

32:07.717 --> 32:09.529
It's worth the risk.
It might be our only chance

32:09.553 --> 32:11.531
of finding this guy before
he unleashes this cyberattack.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.217
Whatever it is.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.843
Excuse me, would you
happen to have the time?

32:33.618 --> 32:35.530
I understand
NYPD is spread thin.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.181
I'm just asking for
a little more cooperation

32:37.205 --> 32:38.946
so we can catch this guy.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.326
I... I'll take
what I can get.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.932
Absolutely.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.884
No, that...
that sounds great.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.595
All right.
We'll talk soon.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.102
Okay. Bye.

33:05.192 --> 33:06.228
I've had it.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.712
We're dealing with
a four-alarm fire

33:07.736 --> 33:09.213
and you're standing here
grinning like you've got

33:09.237 --> 33:10.648
the only extinguisher
in the city.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.099
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.070
It means I'm sick and tired
of the games and the secrets.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.446
I know what you did
to Keaton.

33:16.536 --> 33:18.198
People's lives
are at stake.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.141
- You need to start acting like you give a damn.
- Oh, I do.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.934
Maybe I just have more faith
in the team than you do.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.620
You know,
they're very good.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.167
Okay, okay, relax.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.461
You won't have to put up
with me much longer.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.027
You got the DNI job?

33:29.090 --> 33:30.318
Let's just say that
by end of the day,

33:30.342 --> 33:32.800
all of this
might be yours.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.363
And any possible problems
you have with me

33:34.387 --> 33:35.594
will be rendered moot.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.866
In other words,
you're jumping ship

33:36.890 --> 33:38.242
and leaving me to clean
up this mess.

33:38.266 --> 33:39.598
Mm...

33:39.684 --> 33:40.925
You're probably wondering why

33:41.019 --> 33:42.510
we've gathered you all
here today.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.062
We managed to turn on
Dominic's phone.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.730
See? I told you
they were good.

33:46.816 --> 33:47.816
You got a location?

33:47.901 --> 33:49.688
We... did.
What do you mean, "did?"

33:49.778 --> 33:51.565
As soon as we got a lock,

33:51.655 --> 33:53.424
the signal disappeared again
almost immediately.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.314
He figured out
we were tracking him.

33:55.408 --> 33:56.761
He must have destroyed
the phone already.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.095
If he knows
that we're watching him,

33:58.119 --> 34:00.486
he's going to avoid traffic
and security cameras.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.183
Doesn't mean we shouldn't
keep looking for him.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.618
Rich, comb through
all the footage

34:03.708 --> 34:04.852
in the vicinity of
his last known location.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.868
The rest of you guys,
suit up and go check it out.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.875
All right.
We got this!

34:15.428 --> 34:16.885
You okay?

34:22.101 --> 34:24.310
I was missing Bethany.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.889
I'm not gonna see her
for another three weeks.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.521
And, she's getting
old enough

34:30.610 --> 34:33.068
to understand
how long that is.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.771
Allie said she's...

34:35.864 --> 34:37.982
she keeps asking
where I am.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.068
I miss her, too.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.405
It's getting hard

34:44.498 --> 34:46.286
to stay focused
at work.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.538
Kinda feel like
I'm missing out

34:48.628 --> 34:50.415
on a lot of her life.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.792
So maybe we move up
the timeline.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.626
Start looking for a place
in Colorado now.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.431
Really?

35:00.515 --> 35:03.132
Really.
Yeah.

35:04.185 --> 35:05.892
And in the meantime,

35:05.979 --> 35:09.017
here's a way
to keep Bethany...

35:11.901 --> 35:13.858
close to your heart.

35:15.864 --> 35:19.403
Now, come on.
Let's go save the world.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.458
All right,
Dominic's last location

35:29.544 --> 35:30.544
was right around here.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.586
So, either this place
was important

35:32.672 --> 35:34.413
or it's on
the path to the target.

35:34.507 --> 35:35.668
Over here.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.717
He's dead.
No ID on him.

35:46.811 --> 35:48.222
Right.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.054
Rich, I'm gonna
send you a photo.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.417
We need to figure out
who this guy is.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.932
Yeah, and why
Dominic killed him.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.746
All right,
I'm running facial rec now.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.230
Oh, no.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.778
Oh no?
What do you mean?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.258
What do you mean, "Oh, no"?
Who is this guy?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.194
He's a government employee
named Adriano Dicerbo

36:01.284 --> 36:02.741
who works at NYIOC,

36:02.827 --> 36:04.388
the New York Independent
Operations Control.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.557
Our living-impaired friend
was part of a seven-person team

36:06.581 --> 36:08.142
that monitors
the Eastern Interconnection.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.032
The Eastern Inter...
That's the power grid.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.708
This guy works on
the power grid?!

36:11.795 --> 36:13.036
Any signs it's under attack?

36:13.129 --> 36:14.745
Uh, let me see here.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.333
Okay, uh, no failures,
no alarms.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.488
Looks like
everything's normal.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.346
B... But if Dominic has
a powerful computer virus

36:23.431 --> 36:25.047
and he plans to
sneak it into NYIOC...

36:25.141 --> 36:27.849
Uh, guys, Adriano's crew just
logged in for their shift.

36:27.936 --> 36:29.427
And so did Adriano!

36:29.521 --> 36:30.887
It's Dominic.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.017
If he takes out the other
six people in the crew...

36:33.108 --> 36:35.976
Then he'll control the power
to the entire Eastern Seaboard.

36:36.778 --> 36:39.145
I think we just found out
what Project Helios is.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.826
No, no, please!
Please! No, please!

37:19.571 --> 37:21.358
Okay,
the team is approaching NYIOC,

37:21.448 --> 37:23.092
but they haven't been able
to contact anyone in the facility,

37:23.116 --> 37:24.636
which means
Dominic is probably inside.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.061
I just got off
the phone with NYPD.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.826
- They're securing the perimeter.
- What?

37:27.912 --> 37:29.448
Okay, Patterson,
I'm gonna keep trying,

37:29.539 --> 37:31.781
but I can't seem to access NYIOC
remotely anymore.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.686
You're gonna have to stop
this virus in person.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.121
<i>Copy that. I'm ready.</i>

37:35.211 --> 37:36.827
Please be careful.
All of you.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.457
So, um...

37:38.548 --> 37:40.540
we're preparing
for the worst, or...?

37:40.633 --> 37:42.236
Well, considering Dominic's
track record, yeah.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.529
But like you said,
we got a good team.

37:43.553 --> 37:45.670
Yeah, no, sure.
But when we say "worst"...

37:45.764 --> 37:47.596
wh... wh... what are we saying,
exactly?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.968
Like, it's bad, right?
It's bad.

37:49.058 --> 37:51.095
Well, considering
that NYIOC is the control center

37:51.186 --> 37:52.472
for the entire US Power Grid,

37:52.562 --> 37:54.804
and its sole purpose
is to monitor and maintain

37:54.898 --> 37:56.292
the balance of energy
across said grid,

37:56.316 --> 37:57.727
I would say yes,
it's pretty bad.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.024
Still nothing from NYIOC.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.772
And if the grid goes out...

38:00.862 --> 38:03.479
We're talking full-on end of
<i>Fight Club</i> level catastrophe.

38:03.573 --> 38:06.010
Destroying the grid would plunge
the entire country into chaos.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.026
Hospitals shut down,
rioting in the streets.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.156
The threat to public safety
will be incalculable.

38:10.246 --> 38:12.224
Madeline's trying to collapse
society as we know it.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.559
We need to call FEMA,
and we need to alert

38:13.583 --> 38:15.074
the National Guard.

38:15.168 --> 38:18.161
Oh, my...
Are you kidding me? Right now?

38:18.254 --> 38:20.337
Hello?

38:20.423 --> 38:22.130
Yeah, I will hold
for the president.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.833
Hey, do I have time to...?

38:23.927 --> 38:26.795
I mean, we're in
a holding pattern here, sir.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.639
Eleanor,
thanks for calling me back.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.887
Just one thing...
what did Kurt Weller

38:32.977 --> 38:34.684
come and see you about?

38:37.732 --> 38:39.394
I see.

39:10.265 --> 39:12.723
Tasha, Patterson,
you get upstairs.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.550
Jane, you're with me.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.729
We've got multiple
casualties.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.180
And Dominic isn't here.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.034
He's already inserted
the virus into the system,

39:32.120 --> 39:33.702
but it hasn't fully
activated yet.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.824
You gotta stop it.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.615
You can do this.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.335
Okay.

39:41.921 --> 39:43.332
FBI! Stop!

39:44.966 --> 39:46.832
Dominic Masters, come out
with your hands up!

39:46.926 --> 39:48.007
It's over!

39:48.094 --> 39:50.461
Oh, you're wrong!
It's just begun!

39:51.890 --> 39:55.634
Dominic?
Come out.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.108
Dominic's down.
Dominic's down.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.235
No!
You're not gonna die.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.636
You're gonna tell me
everything that you know.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.902
No, I'm not...

40:16.289 --> 40:18.121
Your phone's locked.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.288
Stay with me.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.789
He's gone.

40:25.465 --> 40:27.331
I got his phone unlocked.
Let's go!

40:27.425 --> 40:28.986
<i>Tell me you
stopped it, Patterson.</i>

40:29.010 --> 40:30.863
- I'm trying.
- Have you considered trying faster?

40:30.887 --> 40:32.323
You want me to turn it off
and turn it back on?

40:32.347 --> 40:33.929
- I'm going as fast I can.
- Okay, okay.

40:34.015 --> 40:35.951
Did you input the overrides
that Erin Sandler gave us?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.095
What do you think?
Obviously!

40:37.185 --> 40:39.643
She created a program
that she can't even stop.

40:39.729 --> 40:43.143
The chances of me being
able to stop it are...

40:43.232 --> 40:46.350
Oh, no.
This is very not good.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.484
We need to find out how Dominic
uploaded this thing.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.904
Look for a USB,
a laptop, anything.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.323
Here!
We opened Dominic's phone.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.679
There's gotta be something
on it that can stop the attack.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.056
Keep that phone charged
and unlocked!

40:57.080 --> 40:58.787
Well, that was a disaster.

40:58.873 --> 41:01.286
I didn't get the Director
of National Intelligence job.

41:01.376 --> 41:03.743
The president gave it
to that snake Nash.

41:04.295 --> 41:05.456
What's... what's happening?

41:05.546 --> 41:07.274
Patterson,
shut it down!

41:07.298 --> 41:08.505
I said I'm trying!

41:08.591 --> 41:09.818
Why does she always
cut it so close?

41:15.014 --> 41:16.676
No, no, no...

41:21.354 --> 41:23.141
We weren't fast enough.

41:23.231 --> 41:24.642
We failed.

41:39.789 --> 41:42.031
Is that what I think it is?

41:42.125 --> 41:43.241
What do you think it is?

41:47.880 --> 41:50.167
We just lost power on
the entire Eastern Seaboard.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.379
It's Day Zero.

41:54.095 --> 41:55.552
What's happening?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.556
I think Madeline just won.

42:42.477 --> 42:43.888
<i>Greg, move your head!</i>

42:44.305 --> 42:50.672
