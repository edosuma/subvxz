WEBVTT

00:35.952 --> 00:37.495
Good day, Miss Osgood.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.080
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.081
Not at all.

00:47.130 --> 00:50.300
I trust Darvis has offered you
some refreshments?

00:50.383 --> 00:53.261
I'd just as soon get down
to business, if that's all right with you.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.554
Naturally.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.161
Where'd you find him?

01:18.828 --> 01:21.122
-A mental hospital in Northern California.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.916
No, he's not a patient.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.751
He's running the place.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.212
He goes by the name
of Dr. Richard Hanover now.

01:27.295 --> 01:31.257
He must have falsified his credentials
with the American Hospital Association,

01:31.341 --> 01:34.677
because he's taken over stewardship
of Lucia State Hospital.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.723
He's managed to dazzle Governor Wilburn
into making his facility

01:38.807 --> 01:41.768
the flagship in his war on mental illness.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.521
Yeah, well, he dazzled us, too.

01:44.604 --> 01:48.608
Insipid nonsense, and I fell for it.

01:50.026 --> 01:53.363
I can't believe I allowed him
to do what he did.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.493
I'll never forgive myself for that.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.095
There is the matter of payment.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.689
Normally I'd charge for expenses,

02:27.772 --> 02:32.068
but the $10,000 we agreed on
is more than generous.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.205
How's 250,000 clams?

02:47.542 --> 02:50.420
Dr. Manuel Bañaga is a monster.

02:50.962 --> 02:56.050
He's brilliant, charismatic,
but he's insane, and he doesn't know it.

02:57.010 --> 03:02.390
That really makes him the most dangerous
kind of person there is, don't you think?

03:05.518 --> 03:08.062
I can't rest until I know he's dead.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.732
Well, I gotta say,
for a quarter million dollars,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.984
I'm confident I can make that happen.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.404
Hm.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.664
I want you to decapitate him.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.628
Once his head is removed,
I want you to bring it to me.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.380
Of course, there'll be logistics involved,

03:34.631 --> 03:38.259
and discretion is extremely paramount.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.388
But of course you know that.

03:49.604 --> 03:54.275
I want to give his head to my son
as a gift for his 21st birthday.

03:56.819 --> 04:01.115
My hope is that we'll put all of this
behind us once and for all.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.330
Do we have a deal?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.084
We do, Miss Osgood.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.877
I'd say we do.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.381
Mother, is that you?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.591
Of course, darling. It's dinner time.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.971
And what do we have tonight?

04:23.805 --> 04:25.640
Oysters Rockefeller.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.559
And…

04:29.769 --> 04:31.479
<i>boeuf bourguignon…</i>

04:32.021 --> 04:33.648
-…and…

04:33.731 --> 04:34.899
Ooh.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.234
Sweetbreads.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.155
I want dessert first.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.617
Now, we have talked about this.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.996
What is for dessert, Mother?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.164
Boston cream pie.

04:52.875 --> 04:53.751
Hm.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.310
Mm.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.561
-Nummy-num?
-Mm-hm.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.022
Mm.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.107
Nothing but the best for this boy.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.618
It's open.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.412
You wanted to see me, Doctor?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.454
Yes.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.831
What is that smell?

06:54.914 --> 06:59.710
Your olfactory capacity
is positively godlike.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.214
They are lilies of the valley, Doctor.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.258
Why did you do that?

07:05.341 --> 07:08.136
Well, your office smells a little damp
this time of year,

07:08.219 --> 07:11.305
so I thought,
"What better than lilies of the valley

07:11.389 --> 07:14.725
to announce that
spring has finally sprung?"

07:14.809 --> 07:16.018
I hate that smell.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.396
Reminds me of a whorehouse in Manila.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.189
I'm going to get a cluster headache.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.524
I'll remove them at once.

07:21.899 --> 07:22.859
Nurse, wait.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.446
I called you here because of
two of our lobotomy patients,

07:26.529 --> 07:28.656
-Mrs. Cartwright and Miss Blix.
-Right.

07:28.739 --> 07:31.200
Nurse Ratched informed me
that she came upon the two of them

07:31.284 --> 07:34.912
engaging in an act
of lesbian fornication.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.790
Excuse me,
Nurse Ratched came to you directly?

07:38.332 --> 07:39.292
I am head nurse.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.544
That is a brazen breach of protocol.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.546
-I'll have her reprimanded--
-No, stop.

07:44.088 --> 07:47.341
The sodomy is alarming for two reasons.
One…

07:48.634 --> 07:53.514
the lobotomy has clearly failed to cure
the primary complaint of one patient,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.308
and seeing as how I am not aware

07:55.391 --> 07:59.896
of Miss Blix displaying
lesbian proclivities before,

07:59.979 --> 08:03.774
the procedure may have actually triggered
deviant sexual behavior in the other.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.067
I'm not sure I see your point.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.195
Because I've not arrived at it yet,
Nurse Bucket.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.782
I've installed a new contraption

08:11.866 --> 08:14.327
in the shower room,
in the basement below H Ward.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.995
It came all the way from Switzerland,

08:16.078 --> 08:20.500
where they had tremendous results
with this sort of hot and cold treatment.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.168
I've written up a set of protocols

08:22.251 --> 08:24.378
I'd like you to administer
to both patients.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.505
Oh, so…

08:27.715 --> 08:31.260
so I'm to take the lead, so to speak.

08:31.969 --> 08:36.516
Well, as you just elected to remind me,
you are head nurse, are you not?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.061
Or has your status changed
in the course of this conversation?

08:40.144 --> 08:43.105
No. Yes. I mean…

08:44.148 --> 08:45.233
yes, I am.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.734
Um…

08:46.817 --> 08:49.320
I am very eager

08:49.403 --> 08:51.864
to deliver you
the results you seek, Doctor.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.785
I will soak the sodomy right out of them.

09:02.083 --> 09:03.125
What are you doing?

09:03.834 --> 09:04.669
Reading.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.420
Reading what?

09:08.005 --> 09:09.298
<i>Leaves of Grass.</i>

09:13.553 --> 09:16.764
Sexually explicit material
is hardly appropriate

09:16.847 --> 09:19.642
for someone with your specific malady,
Mrs. Cartwright.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.143
This book is not allowed.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.522
Homosexual is what Walt Whitman was.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.234
Let's get our minds out of the gutter.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.738
Come with me, please.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.283
It's time for your treatment.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.622
Why are we bringing her down here?

09:41.872 --> 09:42.707
I don't know.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.667
Might have something to do
with the new equipment

09:44.750 --> 09:45.918
they just finished putting in.

09:46.002 --> 09:46.961
New equipment?

09:47.044 --> 09:50.256
How am I supposed to administer treatment
when I don't even know what it is?

09:50.339 --> 09:52.341
You're not. Bucket is.

09:52.925 --> 09:54.760
Hanover asked her.
We're just supposed to assist

09:54.844 --> 09:56.929
and make sure
the patient doesn't become unruly.

10:05.229 --> 10:06.480
Hello, Mrs. Cartwright.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.109
Nurse Ratched and Huck are gonna help you
into this nice, warm bath.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.569
What are we doing?

10:11.652 --> 10:14.655
We're following instructions,
is what we're doing.

10:14.739 --> 10:18.534
Instructions for a treatment
mandated by Dr. Hanover,

10:18.618 --> 10:22.163
and that will be the last question
I answer from you,

10:22.246 --> 10:23.372
Nurse Ratched.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.083
Bring her here.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.882
That looks very hot.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.301
It's a balmy 99 degrees.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.804
No hotter than baths
every one of us has taken.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.185
Hm. It's actually quite nice.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.853
Now secure the lids.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.076
And relax, Mrs. Cartwright.

11:00.826 --> 11:06.165
We'll now engage the pumps to bring
the temperature up to 119 degrees.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.905
-Stop it! It's hot, please!
-Huck. Huck, get her out!

11:37.988 --> 11:41.242
-Get away from her! This is the treatment.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.498
Mrs. Cartwright,

11:47.998 --> 11:51.293
the lesbianism
that has so plagued your life…

11:52.294 --> 11:54.964
…is a nervous impulse
that you evidently can't control.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.718
Please, I'll never do it again.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.512
See? It's already working.

12:02.847 --> 12:07.893
This is what is called hydrotherapy,
Mrs. Cartwright.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.855
It will soothe your nervous impulses.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.068
-It's too hot. It's too--
- No, no.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.529
It's exactly the right temperature.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.492
Oh, sorry, 117. It actually is too hot.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.371
How long does she have to stay in there?

12:27.455 --> 12:29.623
Do you value your employment here,
Mr. Finnegan?

12:29.707 --> 12:32.418
Because I will have you fired,
and with a face like that,

12:32.501 --> 12:34.420
you wouldn't get a job
down at the five-and-dime.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.589
You'd scare all the women
and children away,

12:36.672 --> 12:38.716
even if you are a war vet.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.844
-Just 20 more minutes.
-Twenty minutes?!

12:41.927 --> 12:44.597
We will not stand here
while you boil this woman.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.016
Fine, then you can wait outside!

12:47.099 --> 12:51.395
But this treatment will be administered
in the manner Dr. Hanover has prescribed!

12:52.605 --> 12:54.690
-That's right, just relax.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.789
All right, the patient can be removed
from the hydro.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.343
Jesus Christ, it's boiling.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.138
Let's get her cooled off.

13:26.222 --> 13:30.017
That's what the cold water bath is for,
Nurse Ratched.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.192
You gotta be kidding me.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.653
Put the patient
in the cold water bath

13:40.736 --> 13:43.113
for five minutes as prescribed.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.921
It's okay. Shh.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.924
It's okay. Mrs. Cartwright, look at me.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.093
-Five minutes.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.387
Five minutes,
and then this will all be over.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.442
You're okay.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.737
You're okay.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.743
Shh.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.207
You're okay.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.169
You're okay, Mrs. Cartwright.

14:41.797 --> 14:42.840
Get some sleep.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.595
And we will wake you before dinner.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.228
Huck.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.314
Huck!

14:59.982 --> 15:03.360
No patient… is ever gonna go through
with that treatment again.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.654
Do you understand me?

15:06.196 --> 15:07.656
I don't care if it costs me my job.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.116
Do you really mean that?

15:10.492 --> 15:13.579
Because cruel as it is,
what Nurse Bucket said is true.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.415
Where else are you going to find a job,
Huck?

15:16.874 --> 15:17.958
People like us…

15:18.834 --> 15:20.044
places like this…

15:21.545 --> 15:23.088
are maybe where we belong.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.634
I'm not gonna watch
folks gettin' tortured.

15:43.317 --> 15:44.318
What time is it?

15:44.693 --> 15:46.820
-7:30.
-What?!

15:47.112 --> 15:48.489
Why didn't my alarm go off?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.490
I turned it off.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.449
Why?

15:50.532 --> 15:51.992
-You needed the rest.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.286
Look at you, awake for ten seconds,
and already frazzled.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.247
I'm frazzled because I have
an 8:15 appointment with the governor,

15:57.331 --> 15:58.540
and I'm going to be late!

15:58.624 --> 16:00.793
No, you're going to be right on time.

16:01.794 --> 16:05.047
Breakfast is on the table.
Your lunch pail is packed. Hm.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.215
Breathe.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.343
Thank you.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.429
Hm.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.474
What?

16:15.724 --> 16:17.685
You went to sleep
without washing your face again.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.647
That foundation is making
your pores look enormous.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.440
Go with the mineral powder today.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.817
I think it's gonna rain.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.904
The press event
up at the hospital was a masterstroke.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.656
If you do say so yourself.

16:31.532 --> 16:37.037
Yes. Well, Governor, you--
you handled the whole thing perfectly.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.872
The coverage has been glowing.

16:38.956 --> 16:43.002
I think it's-- it's struck exactly
the right tone for the reelection.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.254
Forward-thinking, humane,

16:45.337 --> 16:47.256
-fiscally--
-This is a good photo here.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.966
What was that nurse's name? Ricketts?

16:49.049 --> 16:49.925
Ratched.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.343
Ratched, yes.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.763
She's got a caboose on her, huh?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.391
-I see.
-Oh, geez.

16:57.683 --> 17:03.313
So I think that the-- the danger here
is in our growing overconfidence.

17:03.397 --> 17:06.442
We haven't seen a poll in several weeks,
and we're not likely to--

17:06.525 --> 17:08.986
What about that murderer?
The guy that killed all those priests?

17:09.069 --> 17:10.029
Edmund Tolleson?

17:10.112 --> 17:11.155
-Mm.
-What about him?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.407
I gotta lean on Dr. Hanover.

17:13.949 --> 17:17.286
Tolleson's gotta be frying
in the electric chair by the convention.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.289
Dr. Hanover's got to declare him
fit for trial.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.791
Well, that will be up to Dr. Hanover.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.543
-No, it's up to me.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.420
You tell Hanover that he'll get his money,

17:26.503 --> 17:29.506
and he can be kind and gentle
to the rest of those nutcases up there,

17:29.590 --> 17:32.551
but I will be signing
Edmund Tolleson's death warrant.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.430
I don't want to be seen as being soft
on crime, especially a crime like that.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.433
Killing four Catholic priests.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.935
Governor, in some cases,

17:42.019 --> 17:44.438
the way to show strength
is actually to show mercy.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.273
Have I been understood? Hm?

17:47.733 --> 17:49.068
Yes, Governor.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.070
Understood.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.931
I'm here to deliver
Edmund Tolleson his meal.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.058
Dr. Hanover usually does that.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.436
Dr. Hanover is busy,
and Nurse Bucket asked me to do it.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.271
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.981
Tolleson's a mass murderer.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.067
If you get too close, he'll strangle you.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.860
Exciting.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.279
Sounds like a fun Saturday night.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.406
You're free to call up to Nurse Bucket.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.450
I'm sure she'd love to hear your input.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.204
In the meantime, I'm going to follow
the instructions I've been given,

18:42.287 --> 18:45.249
and if you have any more ideas,
why don't you scribble them down?

18:45.749 --> 18:48.335
Maybe you'll write
the next great American novel.

19:19.158 --> 19:22.035
I see you've started wearing heels,
Dr. Hanover.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.457
I have your meal, Mr. Tolleson.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.550
I appreciate that very much, ma'am.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.804
Please thank him for me.

19:41.471 --> 19:42.306
Who?

19:42.806 --> 19:47.519
Dr. Hanover.
This is very… humane of him.

19:48.937 --> 19:52.524
I haven't had the pleasure
of a beautiful woman's company

19:52.608 --> 19:53.859
in a very long time.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.154
I'm flattered.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.825
You have quite the striking physique
yourself, Mr. Tolleson.

20:03.160 --> 20:03.994
Eddie.

20:05.537 --> 20:06.371
Eddie.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.751
I have your Salisbury steak.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.670
And your vitamins.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.264
Let me know if there is anything I can do.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.230
Do you mean that?

20:36.735 --> 20:37.569
I'm sorry?

20:38.820 --> 20:39.905
I just mean, uh…

20:41.990 --> 20:45.827
if you really do wanna help me,
there is something you can do, actually.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.163
Although if you're just being polite,
I understand.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.123
I know you have others to attend to.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.544
It's the vitamins.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.049
See, I-- I--
I don't know which one, but I…

20:59.925 --> 21:02.886
I've noticed a fairly prominent…

21:04.054 --> 21:05.180
side effect.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.434
Forgive me, I…

21:10.060 --> 21:12.062
I don't know the medical term, but…

21:14.231 --> 21:16.817
I've had an erection
for the past three days.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.114
It's the…

21:24.866 --> 21:27.244
it's the niacin, it can have that effect.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.829
Uh-huh.

21:30.038 --> 21:32.582
Well, see, the thing of it is, I…

21:33.583 --> 21:36.044
Uh… I can't get it to go away.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.924
Push-ups just make it…

21:41.842 --> 21:42.926
throb.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.553
And…

21:45.137 --> 21:47.180
well, like, I can't relieve myself,

21:47.264 --> 21:49.057
for religious reasons…

21:49.725 --> 21:51.018
if you take my meaning.

22:13.123 --> 22:14.166
I understand.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.173
I want you to cum for me.

23:23.318 --> 23:24.319
Oh.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.036
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.205
Dolly.

23:37.165 --> 23:37.999
Dolly.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.378
Keep taking those vitamins, Eddie.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.587
Yes, ma'am.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.446
- Pervert.

24:10.073 --> 24:10.907
Hey.

24:11.825 --> 24:12.826
We have a problem.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.872
You harbor some sympathy
for Edmund Tolleson, isn't that right?

24:16.955 --> 24:19.249
You believe he's insane,
should be spared the death penalty?

24:19.332 --> 24:20.917
I don't know what you're getting at.

24:21.001 --> 24:23.295
Hanover sent Dolly to deliver him
his lunch this afternoon,

24:23.378 --> 24:25.547
and the guard on duty told me
he saw them…

24:27.799 --> 24:29.968
-I-- I don't know how to put this.
-What?

24:31.887 --> 24:33.847
I guess he saw… her…

24:34.598 --> 24:36.224
-Huck--
-She was…

24:38.935 --> 24:39.895
masturbating him.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.191
I will handle it.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.048
-Fill 'er up?
-Yes, please.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.481
Jesus Christ!

25:47.879 --> 25:49.214
-Whoa!

25:56.304 --> 25:57.264
Motherfuck!

26:05.814 --> 26:08.149
Uh, someone left you a note.

26:19.744 --> 26:20.579
Thank you.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.206
Up to a little hanky-panky, are we?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.625
You run a roadside motel, madam.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.170
You traffic in hanky-panky.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.381
I run an honest business.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.843
Well, then I suppose you shouldn't
stick your nose where it doesn't belong.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.304
You can keep it.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.764
I don't even know what it means.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.267
Must be some sort of mistake.

27:08.043 --> 27:08.918
It's open.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.634
Lock the door, please.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.974
I didn't expect to see you again.

27:23.475 --> 27:27.520
Yeah, well, I guess I was caught
a little off guard by your, uh…

27:27.604 --> 27:29.731
what is it, pretending to be other people?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.316
They're scenarios.

27:32.567 --> 27:33.443
For fun.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.446
When I thought about it,
I guess it kinda was fun.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.491
Why don't you take off your shirt and tie?

27:58.385 --> 27:59.844
So, who am I this evening?

28:10.063 --> 28:10.939
You…

28:12.440 --> 28:14.776
are a handsome young Marine.

28:14.859 --> 28:18.655
Just stormed the beaches of Ormoc Bay
in the Philippines.

28:28.581 --> 28:32.669
You were thinking about your sweetheart
back home in Kansas.

28:33.503 --> 28:37.549
<i>So, maybe that's why,</i>
<i>when your unit entered an airfield,</i>

28:37.632 --> 28:40.760
you don't notice the machine gun nest
right in front of you.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.762
Cut it off, we are losing him!

28:42.846 --> 28:43.680
The leg.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.223
Saw it off!

28:45.306 --> 28:46.391
No, no, no!

28:53.982 --> 28:57.652
Forty-caliber rounds
tear through your right leg

28:57.736 --> 28:58.862
just below the knee.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.034
You don't feel anything at first…

29:06.703 --> 29:08.371
but as you fall to the ground…

29:09.372 --> 29:12.542
the pain washes over you,
and it's excruciating.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.713
It's <i>excruciating.</i>

29:17.130 --> 29:19.841
Oh.  Oh, God, it hurts.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.684
What, is it a little bigger
than you're used to?

29:36.024 --> 29:38.151
They take you to a field hospital…

29:40.361 --> 29:43.323
<i>-…fetch the best nurse they can find…</i>
<i>-</i>No!

29:47.952 --> 29:52.373
She tells you, "It's okay, son,
your endorphins will kick in soon,

29:52.457 --> 29:53.875
and you won't feel anything."

29:53.958 --> 29:57.921
And you look up at her,
amazed at her steadfastness,

29:58.880 --> 30:01.758
<i>her bravery, and you realize</i>
<i>you have to have her.</i>

30:01.841 --> 30:03.384
<i>Right then and there.</i>

30:24.989 --> 30:25.907
Then what happens?

30:27.283 --> 30:28.326
So then…

30:36.709 --> 30:39.504
you make sex with her like a stallion.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.047
Excuse me?

30:42.090 --> 30:45.176
You have intercourse with her
the way a horse would.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.636
You mean I fuck you from behind?

30:47.011 --> 30:48.721
Yes, that's what I just said.

30:57.313 --> 30:58.147
That's right.

31:00.650 --> 31:04.904
Your hands are not soft and comforting.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.698
<i>They are coarse.</i>

31:07.448 --> 31:08.825
<i>You are rough.</i>

31:08.908 --> 31:12.161
You fill her up with your manhood. You…

31:21.796 --> 31:22.922
Whoo!

31:27.635 --> 31:28.469
Thank you.

31:29.429 --> 31:30.555
That was nice.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.850
-Let me pour you a drink.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.935
I'll have one in my room, thanks.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.313
Should we make this a regular thing?

31:38.730 --> 31:41.816
Well, it sure took the edge off of my day,
I'll tell you that much.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.943
Rough day at the office?

31:44.027 --> 31:46.571
Ah, just a lot of cat and mouse,

31:46.654 --> 31:49.407
chasing a dirty Pinoy all over creation.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.454
Thanks again.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.416
My name is Mildred, by the way.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.045
So, next Wednesday, then?

32:02.128 --> 32:03.963
I don't know. Uh…

32:05.548 --> 32:07.091
I gotta say, Mildred…

32:07.884 --> 32:09.552
you were the worst lay of my whole life.

32:10.011 --> 32:10.887
And this?

32:11.387 --> 32:12.931
This is too fucking weird.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.573
I looked in your lunch pail.
You didn't touch your aspic.

32:31.157 --> 32:31.991
Oh.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.993
-Sorry.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.329
I've-- I've been
a little preoccupied lately.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.041
Fatigue, I think.

32:40.708 --> 32:42.543
Well, I have just the thing.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.505
Gerald and his wife have invited us
to join them

32:45.588 --> 32:48.049
for a lovely weekend of wine tasting
up in Napa.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.384
Hm?

32:51.302 --> 32:52.929
-When?
-Saturday.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.393
I would have asked you first,
but Gerald is chief counselor.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.269
He's the reason I made partner,

33:00.353 --> 33:02.689
and I feared if I didn't accept right away
it would be rude.

33:02.772 --> 33:05.149
Gerald says it's just a wonderful year
for cabernet.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.401
I can't do this.

33:06.484 --> 33:07.819
Can't do what?

33:07.902 --> 33:10.613
I can't live like this anymore.

33:10.947 --> 33:11.823
With you.

33:12.865 --> 33:14.492
I can't stay in this marriage.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.997
I know it was my idea.

33:19.956 --> 33:21.457
And for the last three years,

33:21.541 --> 33:24.043
this arrangement
has been very helpful for both of us.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.421
Yes, it certainly has!

33:26.504 --> 33:27.755
I made partner!

33:28.089 --> 33:30.550
You work for the governor
of the state of California!

33:30.633 --> 33:31.884
Please lower your voice.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.971
Oh, I've given you a long leash, my dear.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.391
Once a month,
you get to drive on up to Frisco,

33:38.474 --> 33:42.395
and spend the weekend in your dive bars,
and I never ask questions.

33:42.478 --> 33:43.938
And I didn't ask any questions

33:44.022 --> 33:46.816
when I walked in on you being pounded
by Bob the butcher.

33:46.899 --> 33:51.029
No you didn't, and we appreciated it,
Bob and I both.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.363
I've met someone.

33:54.115 --> 33:56.117
I don't know what her situation is.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.495
But I can't stop thinking about her.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.166
Her name is Mildred.

34:04.125 --> 34:04.959
And I…

34:08.212 --> 34:09.422
She haunts me.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.968
You're a wonderful man, Trevor.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.430
But I just know…

34:18.097 --> 34:20.516
if I don't get out of this,
I'm going to die.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.396
You're being stupid,

34:26.022 --> 34:28.399
unbelievably short-sighted.

34:29.233 --> 34:31.486
If you do this, you risk everything…

34:33.279 --> 34:35.031
for you <i>and</i> me.

34:35.615 --> 34:40.328
So, I would appreciate it if you at least
took a few days and thought this through.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.956
I think you owe me that.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.379
Now I need to take a long, hot bath,

34:50.880 --> 34:51.964
if you'll excuse me.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.456
Are you all right, Dr. Hanover?

35:27.458 --> 35:28.334
Yes.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.670
I noticed your car.

35:31.629 --> 35:36.509
Oh, yeah, just some kids with slingshots
shot some rocks at me.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.220
Well, that's just awful, Doctor.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.638
Did you get a good look at them?

35:40.721 --> 35:43.057
What? Yes. I mean, no.

35:43.141 --> 35:46.435
It doesn't matter. I'll…
I'll get the windows replaced tomorrow.

35:47.103 --> 35:48.312
What is it you needed?

35:48.396 --> 35:50.273
Are you worried they're gonna come back?

35:50.731 --> 35:51.649
Who?

35:51.732 --> 35:53.442
The children with the slingshots.

35:53.526 --> 35:55.862
Because I can alert the staff
to be on the lookout

35:55.945 --> 35:58.573
for young hoodlums coming in here
looking for trouble.

35:58.656 --> 35:59.615
No, can we not--

36:00.241 --> 36:01.117
What do you want?

36:02.201 --> 36:05.079
Well, just to give you an update
on the lesbians.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.957
Miss Blix is scheduled
for hydrotherapy this evening,

36:08.040 --> 36:12.003
and Mrs. Cartwright's treatment
went swimmingly, if you'll excuse the pun.

36:12.086 --> 36:14.213
I've just had a follow-up with her,

36:14.297 --> 36:17.800
<i>and she said</i>
<i>that all her Sapphic ideations,</i>

36:17.884 --> 36:22.680
<i>her fantasies and urges</i>
<i>and so on and so forth, have stopped.</i>

36:23.848 --> 36:25.850
<i>She's even stopped</i>
<i>having libidinous thoughts</i>

36:25.933 --> 36:29.020
<i>about the housewife next door</i>
<i>who broke up her marriage.</i>

36:32.440 --> 36:34.692
So it's a modern miracle, Doctor.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.152
Congratulations.

36:36.485 --> 36:39.947
Continue with the treatments as scheduled,
thrice weekly for two months.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.115
Anything else?

36:41.282 --> 36:42.533
Well, yes.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.285
There's the matter of Mr. Dario.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.621
What about him?

36:46.704 --> 36:48.664
Well, no one knows where he is.

36:48.748 --> 36:52.335
His niece telephoned here this morning
asking to speak with him,

36:52.919 --> 36:54.754
and when I told her
that he had been released

36:54.837 --> 36:57.798
to go to his brother's funeral,
she said he wasn't at the funeral.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.343
So, don't you think that's a little odd?

37:00.927 --> 37:02.845
-I'm so sorry to interrupt.
-I beg your pardon!

37:02.929 --> 37:04.430
We are in the middle of a conversation.

37:04.513 --> 37:05.890
I do apologize,

37:05.973 --> 37:09.936
but Doctor, you and I have an early dinner
scheduled this evening, do we not?

37:11.437 --> 37:12.313
Oh, yes.

37:12.688 --> 37:13.689
I'd forgotten.

37:14.106 --> 37:15.566
Thank you, Nurse Bucket.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.651
Dinner?

37:16.734 --> 37:19.946
Yes, Nurse Bucket. It's a meal.
Many people enjoy them.

37:20.947 --> 37:21.948
Doctor,

37:22.031 --> 37:24.784
Lord knows where Mr. Dario is.
We have a responsibility--

37:24.867 --> 37:26.827
Thank you, Nurse Bucket.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.795
I don't know what you're after,

37:35.878 --> 37:39.215
but I will not stand
for this kind of blatant disrespect.

37:45.721 --> 37:46.555
Thank you.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.184
Nurse Bucket is, uh…

37:50.268 --> 37:51.894
She's in love with you.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.107
You know that, yes?

37:58.067 --> 38:01.028
Once she finally accepts
that you don't feel the same way,

38:01.112 --> 38:03.281
she will sabotage this whole operation.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.493
Hm.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.373
Would you be interested in dinner?

38:15.918 --> 38:16.919
I know a place.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.194
Can I offer sir or madam a drink?

38:42.278 --> 38:45.031
Scotch. Thank you. Neat.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.866
The same.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.209
If I asked you a question…

38:58.544 --> 39:00.671
would you be willing to be honest with me?

39:02.840 --> 39:04.342
Why is he hunting you?

39:06.761 --> 39:07.678
Who?

39:08.262 --> 39:09.805
I asked you to be honest.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.851
Why are you being followed?

39:15.895 --> 39:16.771
I…

39:19.690 --> 39:21.859
I don't entirely know what to say.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.736
Just the truth, Doctor.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.532
You obviously committed
some sort of crime.

39:30.993 --> 39:31.994
Scotch for the lady.

39:32.078 --> 39:32.912
Thank you.

39:33.412 --> 39:34.663
And for the gentleman.

39:35.122 --> 39:35.998
Thank you.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.715
I committed a crime, too.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.093
With you.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.429
When we made Dario disappear.

39:51.472 --> 39:53.349
So, of all the people in your life…

39:55.101 --> 39:57.728
wouldn't I be the one
you could trust the most?

40:03.484 --> 40:04.735
I did a very bad thing.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.195
We all do bad things.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.113
No, but…

40:08.030 --> 40:08.864
very bad.

40:10.825 --> 40:11.700
It haunts me.

40:17.915 --> 40:18.749
Tell me.

40:28.008 --> 40:29.093
It was just, uh…

40:30.052 --> 40:31.512
a few years ago now.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.432
I thought…

40:35.099 --> 40:37.184
I thought I was invincible.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.564
I don't feel that way anymore.

40:44.358 --> 40:48.028
<i>A rich woman,</i>
<i>an heiress to a vast fortune,</i>

40:48.112 --> 40:52.533
<i>she asked me to treat her son,</i>
<i>who she believed was deranged.</i>

40:52.616 --> 40:54.994
<i>When I laid eyes on the boy,</i>
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

40:55.077 --> 40:56.620
<i>He had the face of an angel.</i>

40:57.538 --> 40:58.956
-Lovely to meet you.
-Pleasure.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.375
<i>Polite, engaged.</i>

41:02.710 --> 41:05.337
The boy liked to prick people
with needles.

41:05.421 --> 41:08.466
It's a sexual disorder called piquerism.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.469
Mimics the penetrative aspects
of intercourse.

41:12.386 --> 41:14.180
<i>-He pricked his mother.</i>

41:15.723 --> 41:17.475
-Ow!
<i>-Pricked the cook.</i>

41:17.558 --> 41:19.768
But he was becoming more violent.

41:20.519 --> 41:24.523
He sharpened a leather punch
and stabbed the gardener.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.943
<i>He wasn't seriously injured</i>
<i>and stayed on at the job.</i>

41:32.281 --> 41:34.283
So, I took Henry on as a patient…

41:35.367 --> 41:38.954
convinced that I could find the locus
of the inciting trauma.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.337
Have you heard of lysergic acid?

41:47.922 --> 41:48.756
Hallucinogen.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.217
Physicians in Switzerland had just had

41:51.300 --> 41:54.803
some very promising
therapeutic results with LSD.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.641
It seemed to free the mind
of its workaday constraints.

42:01.143 --> 42:04.688
I told the heiress all I would need
was a full day with Henry alone,

42:05.564 --> 42:08.234
so she took a trip
to the other side of the island.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.279
And I introduced the lysergic acid
to Henry.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.241
<i>Standard dose, 20 micrograms.</i>

42:15.741 --> 42:16.742
<i>But the boy said…</i>

42:16.825 --> 42:17.785
You take some, too.

42:20.621 --> 42:23.958
<i>There was no way I was going to agree</i>
<i>with that, so I pretended.</i>

42:41.642 --> 42:42.476
There.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.604
Twenty micrograms for both of us.

42:57.491 --> 42:58.409
Okay.

43:10.879 --> 43:12.715
Okay, Henry, I'm gonna…

43:14.091 --> 43:15.759
ask you some questions, okay?

43:15.843 --> 43:18.470
And I would like you to answer
as best you can.

43:28.397 --> 43:30.065
<i>I knew right away something was wrong.</i>

43:32.776 --> 43:34.653
<i>He poured the whole thing into my drink.</i>

43:39.658 --> 43:41.702
<i>Four thousand micrograms.</i>

43:41.785 --> 43:44.163
<i>About 200 times the therapeutic dose.</i>

43:49.168 --> 43:54.048
<i>What happened from there I--</i>
<i>I can only describe as a sort of a dream.</i>

43:55.549 --> 43:57.968
<i>I was there in that room, but…</i>

44:00.262 --> 44:02.097
<i>I kept leaving my own body,</i>

44:02.765 --> 44:07.645
<i>and found myself staring at a--</i>
<i>the godhead at the center of the universe.</i>

44:08.145 --> 44:09.813
<i>And then things got very dark.</i>

44:12.608 --> 44:15.235
<i>Then he just started talking.</i>

44:15.319 --> 44:18.864
<i>It wouldn't stop,</i>
<i>it seemed to go on for months.</i>

44:20.032 --> 44:23.786
<i>He kept going on about how a deity</i>
<i>had come into his bedroom</i>

44:23.869 --> 44:29.041
<i>and stolen his arms and sewed</i>
<i>someone else's arms onto his body.</i>

44:29.124 --> 44:31.043
<i>That this is why he was so troubled.</i>

44:31.126 --> 44:34.672
<i>That… that the arms were</i>
<i>the source of his psychosis,</i>

44:35.381 --> 44:37.091
<i>and that he wished me to remove them.</i>

44:37.174 --> 44:39.009
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

44:39.093 --> 44:41.303
Don't… don't go anywhere.

44:46.266 --> 44:49.978
<i>And then he was gone</i>
<i>for what seemed like ages.</i>

44:51.146 --> 44:53.691
<i>Or like he'd never been there</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

44:57.319 --> 44:58.696
<i>And then he returned…</i>

45:00.614 --> 45:01.699
<i>covered in blood.</i>

45:05.577 --> 45:06.495
Now…

45:07.413 --> 45:11.709
we are going to put these on me.

45:12.084 --> 45:14.586
I knew right away
they were the gardener's,

45:15.003 --> 45:16.880
and that Henry had just murdered him.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.340
Oh, my.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.304
Then I heard him screaming.

45:28.016 --> 45:30.894
<i>I watched the boy saw off his own arm.</i>

45:35.649 --> 45:40.446
<i>And when he finished, he wedged</i>
<i>his other arm behind a heavy bureau</i>

45:40.529 --> 45:42.239
<i>and cracked it at the humerus.</i>

45:46.535 --> 45:48.328
At that point I panicked.

45:49.037 --> 45:51.123
He was bleeding out,
he was going to die.

45:51.206 --> 45:52.207
Tell me you didn't.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.835
So I tried it.<i> </i>I tried it,

45:55.419 --> 45:58.213
<i>with the medical equipment</i>
<i>I had with me, and the saw.</i>

45:58.297 --> 46:00.174
<i>I sliced off the arm that was broken</i>

46:00.716 --> 46:02.843
and sewed the gardener's arms onto his.

46:04.970 --> 46:08.098
Even as it was happening,
I couldn't tell if it was real.

46:09.183 --> 46:11.268
But I didn't want him to die. I…

46:15.773 --> 46:17.775
I didn't want him to die.

46:18.817 --> 46:21.069
And I knew it couldn't work.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.614
I didn't have the tools.

46:23.697 --> 46:25.449
I couldn't fuse the bones together.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.284
The nerves were all severed.

46:27.367 --> 46:29.411
So I just tried to attach
the blood vessels,

46:29.495 --> 46:30.871
so he wouldn't bleed to death.

46:31.997 --> 46:33.665
<i>And there was Henry the whole time,</i>

46:33.749 --> 46:37.586
<i>-just laughing and thanking me.</i>
<i>-</i>

46:43.675 --> 46:48.096
When I finished, I gave him
what morphine I had, and he slept.

46:50.015 --> 46:50.849
And then I ran.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.812
I knew that his body
would reject the new limbs, of course.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.232
They would have gone gangrenous
and practically fallen right off.

46:59.817 --> 47:04.822
From what information I could gather,
Henry's system quickly went septic.

47:05.739 --> 47:07.366
He very nearly died.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.577
But in fact, he recovered.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.876
But only after the infection spread
to his legs,

47:17.960 --> 47:19.753
<i>and they, too, had to be removed.</i>

47:23.173 --> 47:24.633
His mother wants me dead.

47:27.094 --> 47:30.138
And I don't imagine it's a gentle death
she has planned.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.688
She's never going to rest
until she finds me.

47:42.442 --> 47:44.820
Then we have to make sure
that she never does.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.408
And I think I know
how that can be accomplished.
