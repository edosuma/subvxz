WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:09.610
* Wa, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

00:09.643 --> 00:12.246
* Whoo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo *

00:12.280 --> 00:14.415
* Doo, doo, doo, doo

00:14.448 --> 00:17.085
* You can flip 'em off, baby

00:17.118 --> 00:19.253
* You can treat them
all so rude *

00:19.287 --> 00:21.255
* You can scream at a honey

00:21.289 --> 00:24.092
* Like an amplifier, too

00:24.125 --> 00:25.726
* Well, you go for broke

00:25.759 --> 00:29.230
* When you go spent up
all your youth *

00:29.263 --> 00:32.133
Looks like you could use
some one-on-one time, darlin'.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.572
*

00:38.606 --> 00:41.175
Relax, baby.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.243
It's all good.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.079
You and me are gonna have fun.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.650
Oh, God.

00:54.322 --> 00:57.091
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

00:57.125 --> 00:59.493
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

00:59.527 --> 01:02.263
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:02.296 --> 01:03.364
* How, how, how, how

01:03.397 --> 01:05.733
* Hey, hey

01:11.572 --> 01:13.141
* You gotta come on.

01:15.509 --> 01:19.180
I know-- it was fun.

01:19.213 --> 01:22.116
: I'm still thinking
about that creme brulee.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.519
Okay. Talk to you later, Sam.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.822
Brody. Chris.
How we doing?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.658
Brody's doing good.

01:30.691 --> 01:33.361
Had a hot date with the good
Dr. Wilkins last night.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.129
It's the third
one this month.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.565
Grow up, Lasalle.
Sam made me dinner.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.567
Cooking for you--
getting serious, huh?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.370
We're taking it slow,
but things are good.
How good?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.272
:
So, dead sailor.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.773
According to
the bouncer,

01:45.806 --> 01:48.676
our victim came into the
club around 2:00 a.m.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.412
No doubt looking to take
some liberties on liberty.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.913
Apparently, it was
Krazy Kostume night.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.248
Packed house.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.883
PRIDE:
Doc Wade.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.851
Never thought I'd see you
in a joint like this.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.389
Well, believe me,
I've had my fair share

02:01.422 --> 02:03.457
of New Orleans after dark--
or in this case,

02:03.491 --> 02:05.359
the crack of dawn.
Victim is

02:05.393 --> 02:07.695
Petty Officer 3rd Class
Peter Karp.

02:09.397 --> 02:13.467
26. Time of death
approximately 3:00 a.m.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.604
Weapon appears to be
some sort of small-caliber gun.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.474
Let me guess-- our sailor's
the recipient of a lap dance.

02:20.508 --> 02:21.475
Whoo-hoo!

02:21.509 --> 02:23.244
We know who was giving?

02:23.277 --> 02:25.313
NOPD interviewed
all the dancers on the scene.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.415
None copped to spending any...

02:27.448 --> 02:30.251
quality time with Karp.
We're looking into the ones

02:30.284 --> 02:32.353
who clocked out
before the body turned up.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.821
No security cams.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.790
Thick walls and loud music.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.892
Pretty much mask
the sound of a gunshot.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.862
Yeah, well, it masks the
sound of a lot of things.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.567
Got a partial print.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.404
That... along with
a little something extra.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.708
Working theory:

02:54.742 --> 02:57.445
Karp brings
some girl back here...

02:57.478 --> 03:00.381
Uh, more likely
girl brought him.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.783
So I'm told.
BRODY: What if
the sailor tries

03:02.816 --> 03:04.518
to take it a little too far

03:04.552 --> 03:05.586
and someone comes in
and intercepts?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
Intercepts and shoots?

03:07.455 --> 03:09.557
Seems like an overreaction.

03:09.590 --> 03:10.891
PRIDE:
So how about...

03:10.924 --> 03:12.460
another club-goer

03:12.493 --> 03:14.362
has an issue with him...

03:14.395 --> 03:16.530
waits for the dancer to leave,

03:16.564 --> 03:18.599
and then slips in unnoticed?

03:18.632 --> 03:21.735
Bouncer would have frisked any
patron that entered for weapons.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.537
Standard procedure these days.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.505
So you're told.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.407
Exactly.
Or what if our perp

03:26.440 --> 03:28.509
wasn't a paying guest?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.480
Automatic lock.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.786
Got some residue here.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.355
Looks like someone
taped over the plate,

03:41.389 --> 03:42.690
kept it from latching.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.993
So our killer...

03:46.026 --> 03:47.795
Got help from the inside.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.469
Special Agent Brody.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.937
How about a statement

03:56.970 --> 03:58.506
for the press?

03:58.539 --> 03:59.640
James.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.942
Didn't know you
were back in the States.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.746
Yeah. Well, you would have if
you'd returned any of my calls.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.881
Sorry. You know how it is.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.017
New job,
new city.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.953
Well, they clearly,
uh, agree with you--
you look good, M.B.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.456
Thanks.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.925
So... what are you doing
in New Orleans?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.427
I'm doing a feature

04:19.460 --> 04:20.961
for the Picayune.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.564
Historical architecture
of the Crescent City.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.899
Far cry from the front lines
of Falluja.
I can tell you

04:25.933 --> 04:27.568
all about it
when I buy you a drink.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.504
Still as presumptuous as ever.
Is that a yes?

04:30.538 --> 04:32.406
I, uh... I-I can't.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.741
I'm-I'm swamped.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.075
The case.
Yeah.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.510
Great seeing you, though.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.446
Don Julio.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.447
Neat.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.381
One lime.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.419
Who was that guy?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.987
James, my ex.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.756
Ex

04:49.790 --> 04:51.825
Ex-fiancé.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.874
Our victim,
Petty Officer Peter Karp.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.410
Hull technician
on the USS Abigail Adams.

05:09.443 --> 05:12.045
He was on liberty
after a ten-month deployment.

05:12.079 --> 05:15.583
Ten months?
That's a long time
to be out at sea.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.785
No wonder you found dude
over at the strip club.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.456
I'm just saying
what everyone else is thinking.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.626
Don't you have servers to upload
or motherboards to crack?

05:25.659 --> 05:29.062
There's so many things wrong
with that sentence, it hurts.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.431
So Karp left
the Abigail

05:30.464 --> 05:31.832
with some shipmates.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.534
Got lost
along the way.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.503
All right.
Patton, follow up

05:35.536 --> 05:36.970
on the "inside job"
angle at the club.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.506
Run backgrounds
on all employees.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.841
Chris, Brody,
head over to the Abigail...

05:40.874 --> 05:42.676
Track down Karp's shipmates,

05:42.710 --> 05:45.145
find out what they
were doing last night.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.547
I'll head over
to the morgue.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.681
Hey, I'll be happy

05:47.715 --> 05:49.149
to run recon
at the club, y'all.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.551
Not necessary, P.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.423
So, Brody, fiancé.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.057
Ex-fiancé.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.593
Spending the rest of your
life with someone--

05:59.627 --> 06:00.828
that's pretty major.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.730
Would've been.
What happened?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.598
Long story.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.166
I got that.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.737
You really want to know?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.772
He was already married.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.508
Polygamist. Damn, I didn't
see that one coming.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.710
He was married
to his job, Lasalle.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.546
And you're not?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.748
I'll drive.
No, no, no,
I got this.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.716
It's my turn.
Was--

06:22.750 --> 06:24.852
till I got my new ride.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.457
What about that, Brody?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.492
Boys and their toys.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.796
MAN:
Auxiliaries division reported

06:35.829 --> 06:38.499
at 0700
for morning quarters.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.101
That's when the OOD got
your call about what happened.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.703
Parents are on the East Coast.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.937
CACO's already notified them.

06:43.971 --> 06:45.506
Sorry for your loss.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.575
It's a damn shame.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.209
This whole incident.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.878
Karp never did manage

06:50.911 --> 06:53.747
to hit his stride with us.
Why is that?

06:53.781 --> 06:56.517
Despite the chief mentoring,
we got the sense

06:56.550 --> 06:58.886
Karp never saw a
real future here.
To be honest,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.954
I was never sure why he joined.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.524
The men you're
looking for

07:03.557 --> 07:05.025
are outside.
Thank you.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.894
MAN:
We were all pumped

07:06.927 --> 07:10.163
to get to New Orleans.
Right before liberty call
was announced,

07:10.197 --> 07:13.033
Pete suddenly decides
he doesn't want to go ashore.
Know why?

07:13.066 --> 07:15.569
XO set a three-sailor
liberty party rule.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.638
Needed Pete
to round out our group.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.508
Luckily, we were able
to talk him into coming
along with us.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.510
Went to the Quarter to check out
this band Tiny Universe.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.145
Karl Denson.
That guy's the man.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.147
Pete enjoy the show?
Thought so, but...

07:27.180 --> 07:29.983
during the set break, Pete says
he's stepping out for a smoke,

07:30.017 --> 07:32.152
never came back.
You guys follow protocol?

07:32.185 --> 07:33.186
To a T.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.688
Ran into some guys from A-gang.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.156
We told them what was up,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.191
and then we split into groups
looking for him.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.561
After a couple hours
of searching,

07:40.594 --> 07:42.563
we just figured Pete
had gone back to the ship.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.602
The slug fragmented
into dozens of shards.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.839
When I recover all of them,
I'll pass them off to Sebastian

07:51.872 --> 07:53.273
to do a reconstruction.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.509
And the organic substance
found in the footprint?

07:55.543 --> 07:58.579
We're still analyzing it,
along with some foreign fibers

07:58.612 --> 08:00.280
we found on the victim's body.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.616
Sounds like you've got
things under control.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.085
I'm gonna go get some coffee.
Can I grab you a cup?

08:05.118 --> 08:08.288
Oh, love one, but I am
off caffeine, sadly.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.090
Three-day juice fast.
Six hours in,

08:10.123 --> 08:12.192
still going strong.
You're...

08:12.225 --> 08:13.293
trying to lose weight?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.862
Oh, no, no.
I never really had

08:14.895 --> 08:17.130
to worry about my physique--
sort of been lucky that way.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.767
But the occasional liquid fast,
it's a great way

08:19.800 --> 08:21.635
to just reset
your internal motor,

08:21.669 --> 08:24.638
flush out all those toxins
from your lymphatic system.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.640
Mmm.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.942
Brussels sprouts, kale, alfalfa.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.112
It's nature in a cup.
Is this a social visit,
Sebastian?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.715
Oh. Yeah. So,
I ran a cross-fiber analysis

08:34.748 --> 08:36.617
on the material that you culled

08:36.650 --> 08:38.285
from the victim's body.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.755
Turns out they are strands
from a synthetic feather

08:41.789 --> 08:43.657
that's been coated
in a red, acrylic paint.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.726
Coincidentally, very similar
to the type that I used

08:45.759 --> 08:50.030
to create my Hawkman costume
for Comic-Con 2006.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.332
You've been to Comic
Never had the pleasure.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.935
Oh, must do. Super must.
Anyway, the feathers

08:54.968 --> 08:57.237
that were found on your victim
could also have come

08:57.270 --> 09:00.641
from a costume, since
it's common knowledge
that dancers like

09:00.674 --> 09:02.576
to adorn themselves
in festive garb.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.678
Which means I have something
in common with strippers.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.946
Go figure.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.815
Yeah, okay, well,
I'm gonna ask Patton

09:07.848 --> 09:09.216
to follow up.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.651
Thank you, Birdman.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.052
Oh, it's actually Hawkma...

09:12.085 --> 09:13.787
Close enough.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.322
PATTON:
So, I pulled photos

09:15.355 --> 09:17.324
and ran background
on some of the dancers

09:17.357 --> 09:19.760
who were working at Scores
the night of the murder.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.796
Starting with the top row,
we have...

09:22.830 --> 09:24.064
Vegas Show Girl...

09:24.097 --> 09:25.666
Peacock Lady...

09:25.699 --> 09:27.668
Voodoo Priestess.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.970
Ooh.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.005
Patton.
Oh. Sorry,
I took a little detour.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.007
O-Okey-dokey.
All right.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.244
We got Roarin' Twenties Flapper,
Pocahontas and--

09:37.277 --> 09:38.879
hang on...

09:40.313 --> 09:42.650
Oh. So that's how

09:42.683 --> 09:43.917
the Pride-man
rides, huh?

09:43.951 --> 09:46.787
So, Wonderful World of Disney?

09:46.820 --> 09:49.990
You do realize my daughter's
about the same age
as these girls?

09:50.023 --> 09:52.192
Moving on.
See, Sebastian found

09:52.225 --> 09:54.995
pieces of red, synthetic
feathers on our victim.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.265
Okay, background
on Pocahontas--

09:58.298 --> 10:00.033
Peggy Mitchell.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.302
She been working at the
club for over a year.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.306
Record is clean, but she has a
bad habit of picking wrong guys.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.675
Find out where she lives.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.010
Apartment, New Orleans East.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.012
But you ain't
gonna find her.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.315
Baby girl got
the day job.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.786
Eli? Eli, what did I say
about eating sand?

10:18.819 --> 10:21.188
Okay?

10:21.221 --> 10:23.223
Yeah, I remember him.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.725
He was in the
club last night.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.293
Watched me perform.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.895
Just watched?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.297
He watched me do my
thing for a little while,

10:30.330 --> 10:32.165
and then, requested
some private time

10:32.199 --> 10:33.867
in one of the
champagne rooms

10:33.901 --> 10:35.135
where we get
our best tips,

10:35.168 --> 10:36.737
so I agreed.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.706
Anything seem unusual
or off about him?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.774
He was pretty loaded.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.175
Not a happy drunk, either.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.844
Kept going on about

10:43.877 --> 10:46.246
how he wasn't even
supposed to be in the Navy.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.715
Apparently,
he went to med school.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.316
Supposed to be
a big shot doctor.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.184
Um, doctor's
a completely different track

10:51.218 --> 10:52.786
than an enlisted sailor.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.688
Well, whatever his track,

10:54.722 --> 10:59.292
the jerk started demanding items
that weren't... on the menu.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.928
When I refused,

11:00.961 --> 11:03.764
he got upset, made a scene.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.932
He lay a hand on you?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.467
I know how to handle tantrums.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.104
I calmed him down, and told him
I'd send in an... another girl.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.807
One with a more eclectic menu?

11:13.841 --> 11:15.475
And did you?
No.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.911
I wasn't gonna reward
his bad behavior.

11:17.945 --> 11:22.149
I figured he would get bored
waiting or pass out.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.751
I clocked out soon after.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.452
Is he in some kind of trouble?

11:25.485 --> 11:27.755
He's dead.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.823
LASALLE:
Pocahontas' alibi checked out.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.024
Neighbor was walking his dog

11:31.058 --> 11:33.460
when she arrived home
at 2:30 in the morning.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.428
Well before our
victim was shot.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.865
Checked into Petty Officer
Karp's education history.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.332
Turned out
Peggy was right.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.802
He did two years of med school
before taking a leave.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.003
What for?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.437
Record said,
administrative review,

11:44.471 --> 11:45.839
but when I called the school,

11:45.873 --> 11:47.340
they said
his file had gone missing.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.776
That's convenient,
to say the least.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.878
Doc Wilkins?

11:50.911 --> 11:52.746
Oh, ex-fiancé.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.514
Keeps texting me about
meeting for drinks.

11:54.547 --> 11:58.418
Oh, must be tough, Brody--
torn between two lovers.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.020
So, I finished the digital
reconstruction of the bullet...

12:00.053 --> 12:03.123
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
slow down there, buddy.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.793
Sorry. The nutrients are
making my synapses fire

12:05.826 --> 12:07.427
faster than usual.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.362
As I was saying, I finished
the reconstruction,

12:09.396 --> 12:13.266
and as it turns out, your victim
wasn't killed by a bullet.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.068
Say what?
He was killed by two.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.470
Karp only had one entry wound.
That's correct, but the weapon

12:17.504 --> 12:19.406
released two bullets in tandem,
one right after the other.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.274
I'm running them both
through NIBIN now as we speak.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.143
Tandem bullets indicates
an older weapon,

12:23.176 --> 12:26.113
possibly exposed
to high heat or humidity.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.180
Yeah, it was probably
left outside.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.151
Seems like today is full
of surprises.
PRIDE:
What?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.954
The gun that was used to kill
Petty Officer Karp was used

12:33.987 --> 12:35.823
in two previous murders.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.224
Both unsolved.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.392
Two of something can be
chalked up as coincidence.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.094
Yeah, but three's
a pattern.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.963
PRIDE:
Which means,

12:42.996 --> 12:45.198
we may have a serial
killer on our hands.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.312
Okay, so now, in addition
to Petty Officer Karp,

12:59.346 --> 13:01.815
we got two other
unsolved cases.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.383
Todd Foley,

13:03.416 --> 13:05.018
age 34.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.920
Killed in his car,
execution style,

13:06.954 --> 13:10.858
back in 2009.
Ryan Cash, 26,

13:10.891 --> 13:13.393
shot coming out of
a mini-mart in 2012.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.463
All three...
killed with the same gun.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.365
BRODY:
Vics were male, ages 18 to 35.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.532
The similarities end there.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.935
Murders occurred in various
locations across the city.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.937
Plus, the timing's
all over the place.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.539
Until last night, the gun
hadn't been used since 2012.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.542
Yeah, Karp was Navy;
Cash and Foley were civilians,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.879
so that rules out
any military vendetta.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.413
There's got to be a connection.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.516
Christopher, take Brody over
to your old stomping grounds.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.419
See what you can shake loose
on our two unsolved cases.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.388
LASALLE:
Thanks for helping us out, Mack.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.058
Yeah, typical Sally--
only calls when he
needs something.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.493
"Sally"?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.862
Oh. Picked that one up
as a newbie.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.563
Kid would come
into the locker room,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.532
we'd all start
belting out:

13:52.565 --> 13:54.367
* Mustang Sally!

13:54.401 --> 13:56.603
at the top of our lungs.
All right, all right, Mack,

13:56.636 --> 13:58.105
how about those cold jobs?

13:58.138 --> 13:59.439
Yeah, okay.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.374
Pulled this from
the archives.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.143
Looks like you've got
your hands full.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.512
Yeah, well, you can thank
the City Hall for that.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.415
Last five years,
force has shrunk almost 30%.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.150
Makes our job
damn near impossible

14:10.183 --> 14:12.152
to...

14:12.185 --> 14:13.520
Duty calls.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.522
Let me know if you
need anything else.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.124
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mack.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.592
LASALLE: All right,
our first dead guy, Todd Foley,

14:19.626 --> 14:22.129
he had a serious
drinking problem.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.898
Three DUI's and a bunch
of drunk-and-disorderlies.

14:24.932 --> 14:26.566
As for the other case,

14:26.599 --> 14:29.302
says here six months
before Ryan Cash was killed,

14:29.336 --> 14:31.504
he was arrested
in a drug-related drive-by.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.207
Charges were dropped.
Say why?

14:34.241 --> 14:36.476
Court records are missing.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.512
That's not a surprise
the jacket's incomplete.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.516
When I was NOPD, requests
were always getting lost,

14:43.550 --> 14:44.451
records misplaced.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.019
Sounds frustrating.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.520
Yes, it was.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.325
That ex of yours,

14:52.359 --> 14:54.527
he is a persistent
young lad.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.429
Have to give him that.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.932
Guy's a reporter--
he lives for the chase.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.300
Playing hard to get--
that probably

15:00.333 --> 15:01.568
only fuels his fire even more.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.170
I'm not playing hard
to anything.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.339
Mm-hmm.
I'm over him. End of story.

15:06.373 --> 15:07.707
If that was the case,

15:07.740 --> 15:10.110
you wouldn't mind
meeting him for a drink.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.546
Have a drink,
catch up,

15:13.580 --> 15:15.015
then end the story.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.587
BRODY:
So, mister,

15:20.620 --> 15:23.090
you really came all the way
to New Orleans to do

15:23.123 --> 15:25.358
some puff piece
on architecture?
Yes, I did.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.127
You have some
lovely architecture here.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.362
It's very beautiful. Um,
you have the lovely cottages

15:29.396 --> 15:30.630
in the, um...
Marigny.

15:30.663 --> 15:34.167
Yeah, right. And then, uh,
gallery houses in the...

15:34.201 --> 15:35.668
Garden District. Yes.
Garden District. Oh.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.604
This one, you don't know.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.540
Then, so in the CBD, in the--
you have these hidden attics,

15:40.573 --> 15:43.110
right, where
they used to do...

15:43.143 --> 15:45.612
speakeasy during Prohibition.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.314
:
Fascinating.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.383
So obviously, I'm not here to...

15:50.417 --> 15:51.518
talk shop.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.620
I'm...

15:53.653 --> 15:56.689
I'm here to see you.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.433
I can't do this.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.509
Is it because of a psychiatrist
called Wilkins?

16:16.543 --> 16:19.546
Ace reporter.
Well, that's what I do.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
I dig the dirt.
Well, there's no dirt

16:21.348 --> 16:23.150
to dig on Sam--
he's a great guy.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.286
He's sweet, attentive,
and nothing like you.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.455
Ouch.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.558
Just sayin'.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.395
So you're still sore
that I took that job
in Afghanistan, then?
No.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.430
We were planning a wedding...

16:37.464 --> 16:40.600
looking at houses,
then you get this call, and...

16:40.633 --> 16:42.702
you're gone?

16:44.371 --> 16:46.406
You took off.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.608
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime, wasn't it?

16:49.642 --> 16:51.611
If the situation
was reversed,

16:51.644 --> 16:55.748
you would have done
exactly the same.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.387
Oh, come on, let's
not talk about the past.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.189
We should live in the present.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.624
Thank you.
With our old friend,

17:04.657 --> 17:07.560
Don Julio.
No, you didn't.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.729
Yes, I did.
Now, this is what we used to do.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.166
This is when
we used to have fun.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.634
Cheers.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.772
*

17:21.874 --> 17:23.676
PRIDE:
Hey.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.212
7:00 a.m.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.380
Early bird catches the worm.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.216
Yeah.
Or in this case,

17:29.249 --> 17:30.517
a strip-clubbin' sailor.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.585
I looked deeper
into Petty Officer Karp's

17:32.619 --> 17:34.587
missing disciplinary
record.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.856
Couple of weeks before
he enlisted into the Navy,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.359
a classmate accused him
of sexual assault.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.461
But as the
investigation ramped up,

17:41.494 --> 17:43.263
Karp dropped out of school...

17:43.296 --> 17:45.298
and joins the service
and gets deployed.

17:45.332 --> 17:47.800
Effectively disappears.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.603
Karp's accuser--
what happened there?

17:50.637 --> 17:54.741
Person I talked to said
the woman was frustrated,
wanted to put it

17:54.774 --> 17:58.145
behind her, so decided not
to pursue the case any further.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.646
Navy wouldn't have been aware,

17:59.679 --> 18:00.747
because without
formal charges...

18:00.780 --> 18:02.615
Wasn't on Karp's
official record.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.287
Sebastian Lund.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.622
"Got a hit on some evidence
from the strip club.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.558
Come check it out."
Wake Brody up.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.161
Tell her to meet us at the lab.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.237
Hey, sneaking out
on me, huh?

18:24.271 --> 18:26.839
It's a... it's
a work thing.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.242
Right.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.147
So, last night was...

18:34.181 --> 18:36.183
A mistake.
amazing.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.585
Well, I guess we'll
agree to disagree.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.354
: James,
you and I don't work.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.856
It seemed to work well
last night.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.259
You know what I mean.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.762
Between the two of us,
you taking off with
a moment's notice,

18:49.796 --> 18:52.732
me working 24/7...

18:52.765 --> 18:55.335
we're never gonna have
a normal relationship.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.904
Is that what you want,
you want normal?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.675
Go.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.747
PRIDE:
What's the word,

19:07.780 --> 19:09.416
Sebastian?
Oh, hey, guys.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.484
I was just finishing up
my... breakfast.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.328
I smell cinnamon rolls.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.829
I may have had one.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.965
With the sugared icing?
Of course.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.468
Juice fast not all it's
cracked up to be, huh, buddy?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.670
Are you kidding?
No, I feel awesome.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.473
I only got... 36 hours to go.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.774
Oh, my God.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.209
Stay with us,

19:36.243 --> 19:37.910
bro.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.547
Sorry I'm late.
I was just...

19:40.580 --> 19:42.682
Caught in a windstorm?

19:43.916 --> 19:45.452
Is that the...

19:45.485 --> 19:47.654
: same shirt
you had on yesterday?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.922
So, Sebastian, what's going on?

19:49.956 --> 19:52.459
I'm still working on getting
a match off that footprint

19:52.492 --> 19:54.227
from the club.
Something wrong
with the cast?

19:54.261 --> 19:55.828
No, the print was
lifted perfectly.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.830
It's the gait pattern
that's all hinky.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.732
See, typically, shoe tread
leaves a raised impression,

19:59.766 --> 20:00.767
but this one's

20:00.800 --> 20:01.868
almost entirely
smooth.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.835
Meaning?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.471
It's possible that

20:04.504 --> 20:05.838
your killer's
quite the fashionista.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.874
High-end dress shoes, like
the ones made in Europe,

20:07.907 --> 20:08.775
tend to have
smooth soles.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.243
I did, however,

20:10.277 --> 20:11.744
draw a firm conclusion
about this.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.546
The material you found
in the footprint.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.814
It's your common variety
Bryophyta--

20:14.847 --> 20:17.350
which is a fancy way
of saying moss.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.819
Moss grows almost everywhere
in this climate.
It's gonna be tough

20:19.852 --> 20:21.421
to narrow down the
killer's playing field.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.989
Yeah, but this particular
sample is coated

20:23.022 --> 20:24.757
with a grainy residue--
it's indicative

20:24.791 --> 20:26.593
of a specific
type of coal

20:26.626 --> 20:27.960
that's produced
by the LeCroix Coal Factory.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.029
Based on the high levels
of carbon, I suspect

20:30.062 --> 20:32.399
that the moss grew within
a half mile of it.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.833
Anyone up for a nature walk?

20:33.866 --> 20:34.901
Oh, I wish I could,

20:34.934 --> 20:36.703
but I am feeling
real lightheaded.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.472
May be time for some food
you can chew, bud.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.975
Before the storm,
used to come down here

20:43.009 --> 20:45.512
and get the best
étoufée you ever tasted.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.648
Why hasn't this area
been rebuilt?

20:48.681 --> 20:52.585
Federal recovery dollars
were based on property values.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.787
Resources never
made it here.

20:54.821 --> 20:58.057
Politics left the heartbeat
of this city underwater.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.428
Here's the coal
factory.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.062
Just need to find the moss.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.298
Moss doesn't grow
in the sun.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.869
Let's check under
the bridge.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.948
LASALLE: There's our moss.
BRODY: We'll get a sample.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.884
All right.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.892
Y'all want red
beans and rice,

21:32.925 --> 21:34.894
got to wait in line
like everybody else.

21:36.363 --> 21:39.699
Go on, Boogie.
Don't be shy.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.869
Make me use these rheumatic
hands to pile it on for you.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.337
You're an angel, Mama.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.307
Sure smells something special.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.412
How long you been
down here serving?

21:52.445 --> 21:55.548
Mm, nearly two
decades now.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.984
Hard times come
and go, but

21:58.017 --> 22:00.052
around here we're like family--

22:00.086 --> 22:01.921
take care of our own.

22:01.954 --> 22:03.022
Dwayne Pride.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.057
Teresa Combs.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.793
Mama T.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.796
Reverend Billy
baptized my daughter.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.131
Spoken highly of you.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.601
Don't believe
everything he says, you hear?

22:14.634 --> 22:16.603
Okay.
You'll excuse me?

22:16.636 --> 22:18.638
Sure.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.642
MAN:
Have a blessed day.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.714
LASALLE:
Hey, King! Over here!

22:31.451 --> 22:33.786
PRIDE:
Todd Foley.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.961
BRODY:
Ryan Cash.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.535
Peter Karp.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.537
All the victims written here.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.740
Must be a brag list.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.908
Guys, another name--
Kevin Heller.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.677
PRIDE:
That looks new.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.711
Christopher.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.080
Running his name
on global locator.

23:04.984 --> 23:07.053
The man's still alive.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.756
This isn't a brag list.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.091
It's a hit list.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.603
The fourth name on that
wall is Kevin Heller.

23:23.636 --> 23:25.538
32-year-old auto mechanic
from Metairie.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.006
No response at work or home.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.709
Put a BOLO out on him--
hopefully, we'll get a hit.

23:29.742 --> 23:30.910
Preferably
before our killer does.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.745
Here's something.

23:32.779 --> 23:36.949
I had a handwriting analysis
done on each day-- turns out

23:36.983 --> 23:38.685
none of them were written
by the same person.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.853
Triple P went double deep

23:40.887 --> 23:42.722
on victim number one...

23:42.755 --> 23:44.491
Foley.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.793
You guys were right--
he couldn't lay off the sauce.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.094
Check it out.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.162
Five months
before his murder,

23:50.196 --> 23:51.931
the bastard got loaded.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.966
Took the wheel and killed
a teenager on a bike.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.535
Why wasn't he put behind bars?

23:55.568 --> 23:56.869
Faulty Breathalyzer.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.871
Cops couldn't prove
that Foley was drunk.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.641
Death was ruled accidental--
no criminal charges.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.209
Which is why it didn't show up
on his record.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.945
Foley got a lucky break.
He wasn't
the only one.

24:05.978 --> 24:08.981
I looked into the drive-by
Ryan Cash was involved in.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.684
Turns out Cash turned state's--
testified against

24:11.718 --> 24:13.753
a big-time drug dealer,
got immunity

24:13.786 --> 24:15.788
and all charges were dropped.
Like we said,

24:15.822 --> 24:17.957
two times is a coincidence...

24:17.990 --> 24:19.826
And Petty Officer Karp's
sexual assault--

24:19.859 --> 24:21.127
that makes a pattern.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.729
If all the names
on that list were

24:22.762 --> 24:24.497
un-convicted perps...
Then the connection

24:24.531 --> 24:26.733
between these murders
is vigilante justice.

24:26.766 --> 24:30.503
LASALLE:
So what did Kevin Heller do
to get his name on that list?

24:31.738 --> 24:32.972
Got a hit off the BOLO.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.140
Heller's been spotted
near his house.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.609
Go roll him up.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.211
BRODY:
Ironic, isn't it?

24:39.245 --> 24:40.747
Protecting a guy
who's a criminal?

24:40.780 --> 24:42.615
Might be a criminal.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.283
Well, his name's
on that wall for a reason.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.753
What happened to
"innocent till proven guilty"?
Come on.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.755
You and I both know
things fall through the cracks.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.257
Maybe so. But if you
bust the foundation down

24:51.290 --> 24:52.959
over a few measly cracks,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.094
the whole house
is liable to come down.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.664
That our guy?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.666
Can't tell.
It's too dark.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.200
LASALLE:
Watch this.

25:03.770 --> 25:04.937
Kevin Heller?

25:04.971 --> 25:07.740
NCIS. We need to talk.

25:07.774 --> 25:10.309
Guys, I-I'm
not a criminal.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.845
I-I'm telling you the truth.
See that wall?

25:12.879 --> 25:14.847
First three people
on this list are dead.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.549
LASALLE:
The fourth name
on that wall--

25:16.583 --> 25:17.784
Kevin Heller, you.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.019
So whether you want
to admit it or not,

25:20.052 --> 25:22.555
someone out there thinks
you're guilty of something.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.823
Look...

25:23.856 --> 25:25.324
we're trying to help you.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.594
All right? It's more for
your protection than anything.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.664
Okay, um...

25:31.698 --> 25:33.265
about a month back, I'm-I'm...

25:33.299 --> 25:34.834
I'm minding my own business,

25:34.867 --> 25:37.103
cops roll up on me
outside the Federation Bar,

25:37.136 --> 25:39.205
and they start accusing me
of killing a guy.

25:39.238 --> 25:42.108
They said I was beefing with him
over some girl in the bar.
Not true?

25:42.141 --> 25:44.777
No, I-I've never been
in the Fed Bar.
What were you doing outside?

25:46.813 --> 25:48.781
I was taking a walk.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.082
Alone?

25:50.116 --> 25:52.018
BRODY:
So to recap--

25:52.051 --> 25:54.787
I.D.'d at the scene
of the crime, no alibi,

25:54.821 --> 25:56.789
and name
on a vigilante hit list.

25:56.823 --> 25:59.225
And your response is:
"I was taking a walk."

25:59.258 --> 26:00.226
What do you...? I don't know
what to tell you!

26:00.259 --> 26:01.160
I'm sor... okay?

26:01.193 --> 26:02.328
They got the wrong guy.
So, you know what?

26:02.361 --> 26:04.296
If you're not gonna arrest me...
Can't force you to come

26:04.330 --> 26:05.765
with us-- just know
there's a bull's-eye

26:05.798 --> 26:06.766
on your back, Kevin.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.801
I'll take my chances.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.805
PRIDE:
So Kevin Heller

26:12.839 --> 26:14.941
doesn't want
our protection, huh?

26:14.974 --> 26:16.809
That's an understatement.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.145
It's weird. It's like
he was scared of something.

26:19.178 --> 26:20.980
Being on a hit list,
probably.

26:21.013 --> 26:23.149
No, something else.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.921
Delivered a few
minutes ago.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.389
Good doctor's
got good taste.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.826
That is, if it's
from the good doctor.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.028
You gonna open up
that card?

26:38.197 --> 26:40.867
Later.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.835
Here's what we know
about the crime.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.003
Heller was a suspect

26:44.036 --> 26:45.872
in the murder of a guy
named Terrence Combs.

26:45.905 --> 26:48.307
Two witnesses placed
him on the scene.
One identified him

26:48.340 --> 26:49.842
in the lineup
as the killer.

26:49.876 --> 26:52.845
NOPD still couldn't
make the case.

26:52.879 --> 26:55.214
Not enough hard evidence.
You said the victim's
name was Combs?

26:55.247 --> 26:57.383
Mm-hmm.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.221
Look who it is.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.956
Is that...
Mama T.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.925
Terrence Combs
was her son.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.697
Keep digging into Heller's case.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.965
See if NOPD
missed anything.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.167
I'm heading
to the Ninth Ward.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.903
MAMA T.:
I told that joker, "Step back,

27:16.936 --> 27:18.705
or you'll get
a earful of Mama T."

27:18.738 --> 27:20.406
WOMAN: They cannot handle you,
Mama T., they cannot handle you.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.877
Agent Pride.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.079
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

27:27.113 --> 27:29.415
Wondering if I might
have a word with you?

27:29.448 --> 27:31.918
Of course. Can I offer
you a slice of pie,

27:31.951 --> 27:33.953
or maybe a glass
of sweet tea?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.856
Kind, but not necessary.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.892
Is there a place
we can talk in private?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.129
About... about what?

27:43.162 --> 27:44.931
Case I'm working on,

27:44.964 --> 27:46.365
involving a man named

27:46.398 --> 27:48.334
Kevin Heller.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.737
Never heard of him.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.705
He was accused
of murdering your son.

27:52.739 --> 27:54.473
Doesn't ring a bell.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.445
What about the other
names on that wall?

27:59.478 --> 28:01.213
The ones who were killed.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.985
Look at you.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.187
Coming in here
acting like you know

28:08.220 --> 28:10.757
what's what.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.892
Don't want any trouble.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.394
I just want to get to the truth.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.896
The truth?

28:16.929 --> 28:20.032
Y'all heard that?

28:20.066 --> 28:22.001
Man wants the truth.

28:23.936 --> 28:27.406
We'll walk down these streets,
take a look around.

28:27.439 --> 28:30.176
You'll see more truth
than you care to know.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.244
Houses boarded up,
WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.080
shops shut down,

28:34.113 --> 28:36.048
crime sky-high.
MAN: Uh-huh!

28:36.082 --> 28:38.084
The truth is...

28:38.117 --> 28:40.519
we're damn near forgotten here.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.089
I hear your pain.

28:44.857 --> 28:47.159
No, I do--
but my job right now

28:47.193 --> 28:51.030
is to solve three murders
and prevent a fourth.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.164
One way or the other,

28:52.198 --> 28:54.000
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of it.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.769
Now, I need you
to tell me--

28:56.803 --> 28:59.505
who put those names on the wall?

29:03.042 --> 29:04.143
I did it!

29:05.511 --> 29:06.946
Y'all...

29:06.979 --> 29:09.515
I did it.
I did it, too.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.317
OTHERS:
I did it! I did it!

29:11.350 --> 29:14.120
Like I said...

29:14.153 --> 29:16.088
around here,

29:16.122 --> 29:18.190
we take care of our own.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.459
OTHERS:
That's right!

29:20.492 --> 29:22.061
WOMAN:
Get out of here.

29:32.905 --> 29:35.541
Four victims,
four crimes.

29:35.574 --> 29:38.845
Each one allegedly perpetrated
by a name on that wall.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.881
Strange coincidence.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.817
Gets even stranger.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.854
Teenager Todd Foley killed
in that drunk driving accident

29:47.887 --> 29:49.889
lived on Galvez Street.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.457
Man killed

29:51.490 --> 29:54.460
by Ryan Cash in the drive-by
lived over on Douglass.

29:54.493 --> 29:57.830
Young woman
sexually assaulted
at Polytech...

29:57.864 --> 30:00.199
lived off St. Claude.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.970
And your son Terrence...

30:04.003 --> 30:06.038
Lamanche and Royal.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.406
All four victims...

30:08.908 --> 30:11.543
...from Holy Cross.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.512
What are the chances?

30:16.415 --> 30:18.550
Now, we know you
couldn't have shot the gun

30:18.584 --> 30:21.253
on account of
your arthritis.

30:22.955 --> 30:25.257
Doesn't mean you couldn't
have written those names

30:25.291 --> 30:27.059
on that mural.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.395
No crime putting
a name on a wall.

30:29.428 --> 30:31.597
It is if it leads
to murder.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.501
So...

30:36.635 --> 30:39.872
...why don't we start
at the beginning?

30:47.947 --> 30:50.917
Was lawlessness
during the storm.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.921
People were grabbing
everything they could to survive

30:54.954 --> 30:57.189
before getting
the hell out of Dodge.

30:57.223 --> 31:00.226
Those that
stayed behind

31:00.259 --> 31:02.261
had to fend
for themselves.

31:02.294 --> 31:06.332
Yeah, well...
city was like a ghost town.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.935
Houses stayed empty,

31:08.968 --> 31:11.037
shops closed down,

31:11.070 --> 31:13.172
crime got even worse.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.674
We called for help.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.244
No one came.

31:18.277 --> 31:21.213
People were losing
their lives,

31:21.247 --> 31:23.916
and no one was
being held accountable.

31:23.950 --> 31:27.353
So you all started putting
the names of the killers

31:27.386 --> 31:30.656
up on the wall?
Bearing witness to our pain.

31:30.689 --> 31:33.459
Didn't think
anyone would notice.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.196
One day...

31:37.229 --> 31:40.532
I opened up the paper and,
by God...

31:40.566 --> 31:43.669
one of them was dead.

31:43.702 --> 31:46.272
Didn't think to ask why.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.375
Not even
after it happened again?

31:50.409 --> 31:53.712
Those others on the wall...

31:53.745 --> 31:57.016
they ain't none of my business.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.919
But my Terrence...

32:03.089 --> 32:05.057
...was beaten to death

32:05.091 --> 32:08.394
by this Heller kid
like an animal

32:08.427 --> 32:10.562
over some girl.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.198
Witness saw him.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.333
Didn't even have an alibi!

32:14.366 --> 32:19.038
Believe me, I know how flawed
the system can be.

32:19.071 --> 32:22.008
But taking matters
into your hands...

32:22.041 --> 32:23.709
is no better.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.547
And at the end
of the day...

32:28.580 --> 32:31.017
it won't bring back your son.

32:32.518 --> 32:35.054
Maybe not...

32:35.087 --> 32:38.290
:
but we all deserve justice.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.232
Any luck?
Lot of anger.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.467
Not much info.
Think she knows
anything?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.736
I do. She's not
gonna give it up,

32:50.769 --> 32:53.072
'cause she believes
Kevin Heller did it.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.307
If that's not true,
we have to prove it

32:55.341 --> 32:58.277
and show her she put
the wrong name up on the wall.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.778
Okay, well,
I'll go back to Garrity,

32:59.811 --> 33:02.481
have him pull
the file.
Get him to meet us

33:02.514 --> 33:06.352
at the Federation Bar
where the murder happened.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.088
Find me something.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.323
According
to the crime scene report,

33:11.357 --> 33:13.592
Combs' body was found here.

33:13.625 --> 33:17.129
Witness claims to have spotted
Heller outside the bar

33:17.163 --> 33:21.367
just after the murder.
Heller says he wasn't
at the Fed Bar that night.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.036
I mean, it doesn't
make sense.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.638
Who takes a leisurely
midnight stroll here?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.808
Where do these stairs lead?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.810
A lot of these old buildings
had attics

33:31.843 --> 33:34.346
that held speakeasies
during Prohibition.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.048
How'd you know about that?

33:36.082 --> 33:38.084
A friend told me.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.754
What are you thinking?

33:42.788 --> 33:45.157
Maybe something
was going on up
here that night.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.574
:
Wow.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.618
Yeah, I got something.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.127
"Undercover Club"?

34:21.160 --> 34:24.163
BRODY:
You were telling the truth.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.864
You weren't
at the Federation Bar.
You were

34:25.897 --> 34:28.100
at the Undercover Club--
gay pop-up bar

34:28.134 --> 34:31.237
held in the attic same night
Terrence Combs was murdered.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.105
KEVIN:
I haven't come out.

34:33.139 --> 34:35.674
Must be hard keeping
a secret like that.

34:35.707 --> 34:38.076
You have no idea.

34:39.678 --> 34:43.549
Well, you got a real good reason
to come clean now.

35:01.567 --> 35:03.402
That's you?

35:03.435 --> 35:06.372
And my boyfriend.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.407
Noel.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.611
Boyfriend?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.213
Yes, ma'am.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.448
So you weren't the one

35:16.482 --> 35:18.717
brawling with Terrence
over that girl?

35:20.952 --> 35:22.588
I-I am...

35:22.621 --> 35:24.790
I'm so sorry...

35:24.823 --> 35:27.193
about what happened to him.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.229
Why didn't you say something?

35:31.230 --> 35:33.299
It's my family.

35:33.332 --> 35:36.735
They would not
understand.

35:37.969 --> 35:41.507
The heart wants
what it wants, child...

35:41.540 --> 35:44.410
and nobody can change that.

35:54.586 --> 35:57.223
I'm ready
to talk now.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.233
MAMA T.:
None of us ever knew
for certain, but we always

36:07.266 --> 36:10.836
suspected Boogie Down Bob
had something to do with it.

36:12.438 --> 36:15.707
Been through a whole lot
of loss, that man.

36:15.741 --> 36:17.743
We all had.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.348
Boogie knew our pain.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.250
Just wanted
to do something to help...

36:26.418 --> 36:28.420
...give us some peace of mind.

36:30.789 --> 36:32.291
Hey, buddy...
come with us, please.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.892
MAN:
What do you want?

36:33.925 --> 36:35.894
MAMA T.: There was a girl
from the neighborhood

36:35.927 --> 36:38.964
worked as a cocktail server
at the strip club.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.999
She recognized that sailor,
Peter Karp,

36:41.032 --> 36:42.934
as he rolled up in the club.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.504
Called her mama,
who called someone else,

36:45.537 --> 36:46.938
and someone must have
gotten it to Bob.

36:46.972 --> 36:49.441
PRIDE:
NCIS.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.578
Stop!

36:52.611 --> 36:55.247
LASALLE:
End of the line, Bob! Hands up.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.648
Turn around.

36:56.682 --> 36:59.485
Put your hands
on the table.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.353
You got anything on you?
No.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.421
All right.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.724
LASALLE:
All right, man. Come on.

37:26.845 --> 37:28.514
Brody.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.604
BRODY: Duct-taped shoes.

37:52.638 --> 37:55.641
Explains how we couldn't get
a match on his footprint.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.478
I'll see you back at
the office, King.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.082
NOPD has got its work
to do, no doubt,

38:04.115 --> 38:06.485
but I promise...

38:06.518 --> 38:08.987
we're gonna do better
by y'all moving forward.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.523
And it starts with solving
your son's murder.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.973
Oh, come on, you two,
go home, get some rest.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.441
Good work, though.

38:29.475 --> 38:31.543
LASALLE: G'night, King.
Good night!

38:35.681 --> 38:37.983
Okay, Brody...

38:38.016 --> 38:39.418
the suspense is killing me.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.086
Are you gonna
open up this card?

38:42.087 --> 38:44.122
Don't need to.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.758
I already know
who they're from.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.827
Well, you feel
like sharing?

38:48.860 --> 38:50.061
Not really.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.532
As long as you're
happy about it.

38:53.565 --> 38:57.436
Heart wants
what it wants, right?

38:58.470 --> 39:00.572
Guess so.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.073
Night, Lasalle.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.543
Have a good one, Brody.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.080
* Gray

39:09.114 --> 39:12.083
* Quiet and tired and mean

39:12.117 --> 39:16.054
* Picking at a worried seam

39:16.087 --> 39:18.757
* I try to make you mad at me

39:18.790 --> 39:20.158
* Over the phone...

39:20.191 --> 39:22.428
Hi.
Hello.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.566
Oh, it's a nice place.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.401
Thank you.
It's, um...

39:29.435 --> 39:31.169
it's home now.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.572
Well, I'm glad
you called.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.807
I wanted to say
good-bye in person.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.411
So...

39:39.445 --> 39:40.946
where's the next stop?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.950
I have an assignment in Dubai.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.117
Very cool.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.487
Yeah, it's really nice.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.624
Well, it was...
it was great seeing you.

39:52.658 --> 39:55.494
It was good to see you, too.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.197
I got some
beautiful flowers today.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.667
Flowers? Ew.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.637
Well, you don't think I...

40:05.671 --> 40:08.073
Oh, sent them? Of course not.
I know you don't do clichés.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.509
I just wanted to make sure
you hadn't gotten soft on me.

40:10.542 --> 40:14.212
Do you wish I was that guy,
you know, sends flowers...

40:14.245 --> 40:17.082
says he's gonna be home
for dinner every night?

40:17.115 --> 40:20.218
You are who you are.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.754
And you shouldn't have
to apologize for that.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.990
Just like...

40:25.023 --> 40:26.825
well, just like...

40:26.858 --> 40:30.529
I shouldn't have
to apologize for this.

40:30.562 --> 40:33.832
* No, no, no, no, no

40:33.865 --> 40:35.834
* Nothing else will do

40:35.867 --> 40:37.869
* I've gotta have you,
I've gotta have you... *
