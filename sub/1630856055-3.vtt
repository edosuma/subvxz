WEBVTT

00:12.241 --> 00:14.103
Right now, the only thing
on my mind is mud.

00:18.379 --> 00:20.586
Everything hinges on us

00:20.620 --> 00:24.000
getting this stripped down
ahead before we run out
of money.

00:26.241 --> 00:28.793
[narrator] 28-year-old
Parker Schnabel

00:28.827 --> 00:31.551
has bet
nearly everything he has,

00:31.586 --> 00:37.068
$15 million,
on buying a massive new claim
at Dominion Creek.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.448
If it delivers,

00:39.482 --> 00:45.655
it'll pay out an 80,000 ounce,
$160 million jackpot.

00:47.275 --> 00:49.206
To get on the gold quickly,

00:49.241 --> 00:52.896
he's opening a cut
already started
by the previous owner.

00:54.862 --> 00:55.931
[Parker] It's a dangerous one

00:55.965 --> 00:57.896
'cause we had to finish
what Dean had started

00:57.931 --> 01:00.344
and I'm not letting that turn
into a massive mess

01:00.379 --> 01:03.344
because if you just stop
in the middle of mud,
you're screwed.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.206
The weather's starting to turn
and we're way behind,

01:07.241 --> 01:09.758
and that's a lot of mud
to move.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.827
[Mitch] Parker made
a huge commitment here

01:15.862 --> 01:17.862
buying this ground
at Dominion Creek

01:17.896 --> 01:19.482
which is awesome,
this is what we needed,

01:19.517 --> 01:23.482
it's very exciting,
but it's also very stressful

01:23.517 --> 01:26.620
because right now,
I would not wanna be
Parker's checkbook.

01:26.655 --> 01:27.758
It's taking a beating.

01:29.413 --> 01:32.620
[narrator] Parker's operating
on a razor's edge.

01:32.655 --> 01:37.448
To make the deal work,
he needs 5,000 ounces
this year.

01:37.482 --> 01:40.655
But to do it,
he's spending a ton of money

01:40.689 --> 01:45.033
and risks going broke
before he can bring in
any gold.

01:47.689 --> 01:49.068
What's happening, man?

01:49.103 --> 01:50.689
-I'm stressed out.
-[Mitch] I bet.

01:50.723 --> 01:53.896
I'm stressed out.
It's a lot of money going out.

01:53.931 --> 01:55.827
[Parker] We're spending
in a day here more than
I spent

01:55.862 --> 01:59.448
in the entire first season
mining at Big Nugget
with my grandpa.

01:59.482 --> 02:00.758
[Mitch] That's insane.

02:00.793 --> 02:05.586
And this cut could break us
if we don't just get it done.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.033
So, that's a little scary.

02:08.068 --> 02:10.965
We are way behind
on the stripping.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.275
The only hope is by throwing
everything we've got at this.

02:15.310 --> 02:18.275
We'll be here
till [bleep] November.
I'm just moving mud.

02:18.310 --> 02:19.482
If we're not careful.

02:19.517 --> 02:20.724
Got you.

02:20.758 --> 02:25.448
My goal is to keep
the two 11s ripping 24-7,
all right?

02:25.482 --> 02:29.482
Having two hoes
loading as many trucks
as we can keep running.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.724
It's gonna be the fastest way
to catch us up.

02:32.758 --> 02:35.172
I think three days
might catch us up, right?

02:35.206 --> 02:37.930
[Mitch] Well, yeah,
as long as the trucks
can motor on this stuff.

02:37.965 --> 02:40.413
Well, let's take
a stab at this.

02:40.448 --> 02:43.067
Um, I don't know
if it's gonna work or not.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.620
-Well, we can
give it a try, man.
-All right.

02:44.655 --> 02:45.896
-Don't forget your radio.
-Yeah.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.000
-[Parker] Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

02:49.241 --> 02:52.482
[narrator] The claim
is half the size of Manhattan.

02:53.482 --> 02:55.965
Parker's first move
at Dominion

02:56.000 --> 02:58.827
is to mine
the 40-acre money pit

02:58.862 --> 03:02.413
which could deliver
3,000 ounces.

03:02.448 --> 03:08.000
The entire area
needs to be stripped down
to the pay layer to thaw.

03:08.034 --> 03:12.172
In the first week,
they've gotten through
4.5 acres,

03:12.206 --> 03:14.965
but Parker wants
to double the pace

03:15.000 --> 03:18.551
and get through
the same amount
in just three days.

03:21.241 --> 03:23.689
Parker's wanting
to get through
some more ground faster

03:23.724 --> 03:26.448
and in order to do that,
we're taking the trucks

03:26.482 --> 03:28.448
right down to where
the CATs are ripping.

03:28.482 --> 03:31.793
You rip that ground up,
then you start driving
on top of it,

03:31.827 --> 03:33.793
it can be punishment
on these trucks.

03:33.827 --> 03:36.310
If it works,
it's gonna be awesome.

03:36.344 --> 03:38.448
But if it doesn't,
we're gonna have a lot
of broken trucks.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.827
So at the moment,
we have quite a bit
opened up,

03:43.862 --> 03:46.413
but now when the weather
starts warming,

03:46.448 --> 03:49.517
we're gonna
have to tighten things up
a little bit.

03:50.896 --> 03:53.551
[narrator] Veteran miner
Damien Browne

03:53.586 --> 03:56.793
begins ripping the next
four acres of overburden

03:56.827 --> 03:58.689
in a D10 dozer.

03:58.724 --> 04:03.551
Parker has given us
three days now to get down
to gravels.

04:03.586 --> 04:06.379
It's just pretty chaotic
around here these days.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.965
But we're getting down.

04:12.724 --> 04:16.344
Driving around up here,
like you can see [chuckles]

04:16.379 --> 04:20.067
the mud is covering
just frost, right?

04:20.103 --> 04:22.586
[narrator] In his first year
working for Parker,

04:22.620 --> 04:26.137
Kayden Potvin
in the 750 excavator

04:26.172 --> 04:29.206
loads the waste dirt
into trucks.

04:29.241 --> 04:30.517
[Kayden]
They're just sliding around,

04:30.551 --> 04:32.034
spinning all the tires
all the time.

04:33.413 --> 04:35.551
Can't really get any traction.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.689
Whoo, I'm sliding.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.448
Yeah, it's getting
a little harder for you guys
to drive around.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.689
[narrator]
Another Schnabel rookie,
Jacob McClure,

04:48.724 --> 04:52.896
trucks the overburden
out of the cut
to a waste site.

04:52.931 --> 04:54.931
Yeah, I don't know
if we're gonna have
enough time

04:54.965 --> 04:57.448
to move it all
before it melts.

05:10.965 --> 05:13.551
[bleep] no. Please don't
[bleep] do this to me.

05:15.931 --> 05:18.103
I'm literally gonna
[bleep] my pants
if I get stuck here, man.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.517
No!

05:22.551 --> 05:24.586
Don't do this to me!

05:29.517 --> 05:31.172
[Jacob cheering]

05:33.034 --> 05:36.344
I thought I heard
a weird sound
'cause I can hear...

05:36.379 --> 05:38.034
Yeah, something's [bleep].

05:38.068 --> 05:40.448
Jacob! Your skid plate!

05:43.034 --> 05:44.517
Jacob!

05:44.551 --> 05:45.448
There might be
something wrong,

05:45.482 --> 05:46.655
I thought I heard
a weird sound,

05:46.689 --> 05:48.724
so I'm gonna
have to get out
and see what's going on.

05:52.724 --> 05:55.517
What the [bleep]?
My skid plate's fallen off.

05:55.551 --> 05:58.344
There should be pins,
this one's all bent
to [bleep].

05:58.379 --> 06:00.827
There should be skid plates
covering all of this stuff
here.

06:02.620 --> 06:03.482
[Jacob over radio] Hey, Mitch.

06:05.344 --> 06:06.827
Yeah, Jacob, what's up?

06:06.862 --> 06:10.620
I'm dragging my skid plates
on the ground here.

06:10.655 --> 06:12.862
[Mitch] All right, man.
Hey, I'm just coming back
right now.

06:12.896 --> 06:14.965
Copy that. I will pull over.

06:17.413 --> 06:19.551
[Mitch] The last thing we want
is a stick to get up in there,

06:19.586 --> 06:22.689
rip out the wiring
or the hydraulic lines
or anything like that

06:22.724 --> 06:24.137
and make a bunch more work
for us.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.034
[narrator] Mitch
and mechanic Bill Horton

06:31.068 --> 06:33.965
must get the truck
back into the cut fast

06:34.000 --> 06:36.689
in order to hit
Parker's deadline.

06:37.655 --> 06:40.034
[Bill] This one's
bent a little bit.

06:40.068 --> 06:44.586
Out here, we don't have
a big press like we would
in a shop,

06:44.620 --> 06:46.655
so we gotta make everything.

06:47.724 --> 06:50.275
[Mitch] See if we can
bend that into place.

06:50.310 --> 06:54.931
[narrator] The quick fix?
Bend the steel skid plate
back into shape

06:54.965 --> 06:57.896
with the bucket
of a 750 excavator.

06:57.931 --> 06:59.241
[Bill] You got it, Mitch.

06:59.896 --> 07:00.793
Perfect.

07:03.344 --> 07:06.068
And look at that. First try.

07:06.103 --> 07:07.000
[Mitch] Pretty close?

07:07.034 --> 07:08.551
-It's bang on.
-[Mitch] Nice!

07:10.310 --> 07:11.758
[Bill] Going in there.

07:11.793 --> 07:13.758
A little bit of dirt
for lunch.

07:13.793 --> 07:15.172
We'll take that.

07:15.862 --> 07:17.379
There we go.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.689
[Mitch] There it is.
Put some bolts in there
and send her back to work.

07:19.724 --> 07:22.241
[ratchet whirring]

07:23.551 --> 07:26.034
[Mitch] Here we go.
Get this thing back out there.

07:26.068 --> 07:26.862
[Jacob] Sweet.

07:29.103 --> 07:31.413
You know Parker,
he's given us three days
to move mud,

07:31.448 --> 07:33.344
but problems,
we've got lots of them.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.000
[Brian] I feel like
Rick's in a good position.

07:53.275 --> 07:55.517
Everything's kind of set up
and just ready to go.

07:56.344 --> 07:58.103
Here, he should be fine.

07:58.137 --> 08:00.379
I feel comfortable
leaving at this point.

08:00.413 --> 08:05.206
I just gotta get home.
My wife, my child, my job.
I just got a lot going on.

08:09.965 --> 08:11.413
-[Brian] What's up, buddy?
-Hey, pal.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.137
-[Brian] Oh.
-Where are you going?

08:14.172 --> 08:16.379
-[Brian chuckling] I gotta go.
-[Rick] All right.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.310
[Brian] We talked about this.

08:19.689 --> 08:22.206
-It's better to just rip
the Band-Aid off.
-[Rick] Yeah, I know.

08:23.689 --> 08:27.103
-[Brian] You're good, right?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm good.

08:27.137 --> 08:29.068
-I mean, I'm gonna miss you.
-[Brian] Yeah. Me, too.

08:29.103 --> 08:30.448
But, no, I am good. Yeah.

08:30.482 --> 08:32.517
Thanks for making sure
of that.

08:32.551 --> 08:34.275
-I appreciate everything,
all right?
-[Brian] Yeah.

08:34.309 --> 08:35.309
[both grunting]

08:35.344 --> 08:36.688
-Get out of here.
-[Brian] I'll talk to you.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.793
[Rick] Yeah, yeah.

08:42.724 --> 08:43.793
Drive safe.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.862
It sucks he's gotta leave,
but he's got good reasons.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.517
He's got a wife and kid
to get home to,

08:50.551 --> 08:53.206
but I'm glad he was able
to come up for a few weeks
just to make sure I was good.

08:54.965 --> 08:56.344
It truly won't be the same
without him.

09:02.310 --> 09:04.689
[narrator]
After disappearing for a year,

09:04.724 --> 09:10.172
Rick Ness
is on a make-or-break
comeback mission.

09:10.206 --> 09:12.000
[Rick] We got
the gold coming in
and that's what we need.

09:14.206 --> 09:17.172
I'm all revved up,
but there's trust issues
all around like,

09:17.206 --> 09:19.413
"Is he okay?"
"Is he gonna fail?"

09:19.448 --> 09:21.275
Well, I know
the answer to that,

09:21.310 --> 09:23.137
but I still have
a lot to prove up here.

09:26.137 --> 09:28.206
[narrator]
To get his season started,

09:28.241 --> 09:30.448
Rick had to sell
his late mom's house

09:30.482 --> 09:35.724
and sign over his camp
to landowner Troy Taylor
as collateral.

09:41.275 --> 09:45.689
Now, he's operating
hand-to-mouth,

09:45.724 --> 09:51.206
and needs 20 ounces a week
to build cash reserves
for more crew and equipment.

09:52.862 --> 09:55.551
We're running the plant,
but we're not getting ahead
of anything.

09:55.586 --> 09:57.965
We got gold coming in,
we got stockpiles.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.620
But, you know,
that's not gonna last forever.

10:00.655 --> 10:02.655
1,000 ounce is what I set,

10:02.689 --> 10:04.448
and right now
we're sustaining,

10:04.482 --> 10:06.241
but we gotta be
looking ahead, man.

10:06.275 --> 10:07.172
That's the truth.

10:08.931 --> 10:11.965
[narrator] Rick's plan
to hit his season target?

10:12.000 --> 10:16.206
First, run two old pay piles
to make a quick score.

10:16.241 --> 10:20.551
And then move
to gold rich Rally Valley.

10:20.586 --> 10:26.103
Four weeks in,
he's delivered 21 ounces
of gold worth $42,000.

10:27.103 --> 10:28.517
[Rick] At the moment,
the biggest thing

10:28.551 --> 10:30.586
is just gonna be
getting some more crew
in here.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.931
It's just Morgan and I.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.137
I'm not getting ahead
of the game here,

10:33.172 --> 10:34.000
and that's what I need
to be doing.

10:37.448 --> 10:39.862
[Morgan] Rick's looking
for more crew right now.

10:39.896 --> 10:43.241
No one else is coming in,
so I am feeling a bit
of pressure.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.896
I can't do it all on my own.

10:46.758 --> 10:51.241
[narrator]
With Zee gone, Rick's down
to just one other crew member.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.724
Gold-mining greenhorn,
Morgan Lauren.

10:53.758 --> 10:54.551
[Morgan] It gets so hot.

10:57.034 --> 10:59.724
[narrator] Morgan's operating
an old rented loader.

11:01.482 --> 11:02.758
[Morgan]
So, it'll be really nice

11:02.793 --> 11:04.827
if Rick finally gets
newer equipment.

11:04.862 --> 11:11.379
If we can get any out here,
you know, this works, but,
I mean, there's no front cab.

11:11.413 --> 11:13.413
I'm eating dirt
this whole time.

11:13.448 --> 11:15.862
The tires
are just kicking dirt
back up in my face.

11:31.448 --> 11:32.689
[Morgan] Oh, what the hell?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.379
This thing.
Something is wrong.

11:38.896 --> 11:42.034
Dude, it's leaned over so bad.
We got a flat tire.

11:43.379 --> 11:44.482
[bleep]

11:45.896 --> 11:47.379
-Hey, Rick?
-[Rick over radio]
Yeah, go for Rick.

11:47.413 --> 11:50.448
[Morgan] I'm gonna
have to shut down the plant.
The loader's got a flat.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.068
Well, that's it.

12:02.103 --> 12:04.103
Blew a tire on the loader.
Just [bleep] now.

12:07.379 --> 12:08.965
I gotta figure something out.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.931
[bleep] it is.
Gotta find a tire,
find a loader,

12:10.965 --> 12:12.034
find [bleep] something.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.655
So right now,
I've got an old loader,

12:22.689 --> 12:25.137
but it's not the answer
for this season.

12:25.172 --> 12:26.655
I need something
I can rely on.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.827
So I'm gonna see
Parker right now,

12:28.862 --> 12:30.172
I heard he just bought
a whole another mine,

12:30.206 --> 12:32.103
got a bunch of equipment
with it.

12:32.137 --> 12:34.034
So I'm hoping maybe
he's got a spare loader.

12:34.068 --> 12:36.344
'Cause I [bleep]
need one bad.

12:36.379 --> 12:39.310
Maybe he's got something
that we can make a deal on.
I sure hope so.

12:39.344 --> 12:43.068
It's been a few years.
I really don't know
what to expect here.

12:43.103 --> 12:45.965
[narrator] Rick and Parker
have a deep history.

12:47.758 --> 12:50.655
Hired by
a 17-year-old Parker...

12:50.689 --> 12:52.862
Today's Rick's first day
on the job.

12:52.896 --> 12:55.896
[narrator] ...to help him
with his small gold claim,

12:55.931 --> 13:01.068
Rick was pivotal
in helping him grow
into a successful miner,

13:01.103 --> 13:03.103
rising to be his foreman.

13:03.137 --> 13:04.689
-Thanks, buddy.
-[Parker] Let's get it.

13:04.724 --> 13:07.931
[narrator]
But when the relationship
began to sour...

13:07.965 --> 13:10.517
You're acting
like a [bleep] toddler, Rick.

13:10.551 --> 13:13.172
[Parker] You are making
an enemy out of me.

13:13.206 --> 13:14.379
It's not what I intended.

13:14.413 --> 13:16.241
[Rick] [bleep] Parker, man.

13:16.275 --> 13:17.620
I'm just [bleep] sick of it.

13:17.655 --> 13:20.551
[narrator] ...Rick left
to be his own boss.

13:20.586 --> 13:22.827
Yeah, I'm going out
mining on my own.

13:22.862 --> 13:25.931
I've got an opportunity
and I'm gonna take it.

13:27.655 --> 13:28.448
Jeez.

13:29.862 --> 13:34.000
[narrator] And the two
haven't spoken in two years.

13:34.034 --> 13:35.620
[Rick] Parker and I
have got a lot of history.

13:35.655 --> 13:37.137
Yeah, some of it
isn't so great,

13:37.172 --> 13:38.689
but, you know,
I'm looking forward
to seeing him.

13:38.724 --> 13:39.758
I hope he feels
the same way.

13:39.793 --> 13:41.551
We're just gonna find out.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.034
[Rick] I'm sure Parker knows
I haven't been around
for a year.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.000
Maybe he's heard some rumors.
I don't know.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.724
[Rick] Oh, boy, here we go.

14:23.551 --> 14:25.000
[Rick] [bleep] me.

14:28.206 --> 14:30.758
If I knew you were coming out,
I'd have told you
to bring that hoe over.

14:30.793 --> 14:32.310
I needed this edge bailed.

14:36.862 --> 14:38.206
I don't know
if you can afford me.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.172
[both laughing]

14:41.448 --> 14:44.137
[narrator] Two years
after they last spoke,

14:44.172 --> 14:49.000
Rick Ness needs a favor
from his old boss,
Parker Schnabel.

14:49.034 --> 14:50.689
-[Rick] How you been, bud?
-Good, how are you?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.206
-[Rick] Good to see you, man.
-Good to see you, too.

14:54.137 --> 14:55.068
[Parker] So you're back.

14:55.724 --> 14:56.655
I'm back.

14:56.689 --> 14:58.034
-How're you feeling?
-I feel great.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.724
-Good.
-Yeah.

14:59.758 --> 15:01.344
I know a lot of people up here
are surprised,

15:01.379 --> 15:03.275
but they ain't
getting rid of me that easy.

15:03.310 --> 15:06.793
No, you're a survivor.
I've said that to everybody.
I have.

15:06.827 --> 15:10.000
No matter what,
I've said [bleep]
guy survives.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.172
[Rick laughing]

15:12.206 --> 15:14.241
Wasn't exactly good
for business to take
a year off,

15:14.275 --> 15:15.241
but it had to happen.

15:15.275 --> 15:17.137
-[Parker chuckles] No?
-[Rick chuckles] Yeah.

15:17.172 --> 15:20.000
-I had a lot of [bleep]
to figure out and...
-Yeah.

15:20.034 --> 15:21.448
One of the things
that I figured out

15:21.482 --> 15:25.965
is that I probably gave you
my most productive,
hardworking years.

15:26.689 --> 15:27.689
Right.

15:28.551 --> 15:29.379
[Rick] You know?

15:30.827 --> 15:32.758
[Parker] We had no idea
what we were doing
in the beginning.

15:32.793 --> 15:34.000
I had no idea
what I was doing.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.000
Oh, me neither.

15:35.931 --> 15:37.655
[Parker] In every aspect.

15:37.689 --> 15:40.103
You gave your best years
to my worst ones.

15:40.827 --> 15:42.586
Yeah.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.137
-In terms of managing
and all that kind of stuff.
-Sure, sure.

15:45.172 --> 15:47.241
[Parker] And we were
working like dogs.

15:48.310 --> 15:49.862
The thing is
I don't regret it

15:49.896 --> 15:53.827
because what I learned
working for you
was what I needed.

15:53.862 --> 15:56.000
Now I feel like
I've got that old [bleep]
energy back.

15:56.931 --> 15:57.896
[Parker] Good.

15:59.551 --> 16:02.965
Are you out here
just for a hello
or do you need anything?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.310
Anything I can help with?

16:04.344 --> 16:05.758
Oh, no, I came out here
for a hello, but, yeah,

16:05.793 --> 16:06.724
of course I need
something, too.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.758
I always
need something, Parker.

16:08.241 --> 16:09.827
[Rick laughs]

16:09.862 --> 16:11.689
No, specifically, you know...

16:11.724 --> 16:12.724
Obviously, it's great
to see you.

16:12.758 --> 16:14.034
Well, I really
need a loader.

16:18.551 --> 16:21.068
Right. Yeah,
I think we inherited
a few things here.

16:21.103 --> 16:22.620
-Let's go have a look at 'em.
-Cool, man.

16:22.655 --> 16:24.137
[Parker] Yeah. No worries.

16:34.827 --> 16:39.793
[narrator] When Parker
bought Dominion Creek
lock, stock, and barrel...

16:39.827 --> 16:43.758
This thing, I honestly...
I have not even looked at it.

16:43.793 --> 16:46.724
[narrator] ...it came
with $2 million worth
of equipment.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.344
[Parker] It's definitely
nothing special.

16:50.379 --> 16:51.965
-[Rick] Can I start it?
-[Parker] Yep.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.793
[engine starts]

16:53.551 --> 16:54.517
[Rick] Sounds good.

16:55.586 --> 16:57.241
It's exactly what I need.

16:58.275 --> 17:00.413
[Rick chuckles]

17:00.448 --> 17:02.586
I think we'll have to try
to wheel and deal on this.

17:02.620 --> 17:03.931
I don't know
what you're thinking.

17:03.965 --> 17:08.172
Oh, it's not gonna be
a wheel and deal.
I hate talking money.

17:08.205 --> 17:11.172
Especially talking
with friends about it.
Just use it.

17:11.205 --> 17:13.448
-We'll work it out
in the fall.
-You sure?

17:13.482 --> 17:14.862
You know,
you hit the motherlode,

17:14.896 --> 17:18.000
-I'll expect a few ounces
of gold rent, but...
-[chuckles] Sheesh.

17:18.034 --> 17:20.792
But no,
if it helps you out, take it,

17:20.827 --> 17:23.275
and just get back
on your feet, man.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.862
Like, that's the biggest thing
that you need to do.

17:25.896 --> 17:28.344
[bleep] man, I appreciate
the hell out of that, Parker.

17:28.378 --> 17:31.206
I know we've had
our differences,

17:31.241 --> 17:32.896
but I won't leave you
in the lurch.

17:32.931 --> 17:36.827
But I do want to see you
get back on your feet
and make this work.

17:36.862 --> 17:37.793
I appreciate that.

17:37.827 --> 17:41.137
And this is
a pretty small gesture,

17:41.172 --> 17:44.310
but it's better than
"Get the [bleep] out my yard."

17:44.344 --> 17:47.137
No, Parker, I honest to God,
I appreciate the hell
out of it.

17:47.172 --> 17:48.000
-Thank you.
-[Parker] No worries.

17:48.034 --> 17:49.448
[Rick] That's
a hell of a deal.

17:49.482 --> 17:52.931
Come pick it up sometime
hopefully when the roads
are a bit better

17:52.965 --> 17:54.655
or you can trailer it
out of here,

17:54.689 --> 17:56.931
but nobody will haul
right now anyway, will they?

17:56.965 --> 17:58.137
[Rick] Yeah, I don't think so.

17:58.172 --> 17:59.965
I mean, these roads
are terrible.

18:01.275 --> 18:02.068
Yeah.

18:03.172 --> 18:05.068
But, anyways,
it's really good
to see you, man.

18:05.103 --> 18:07.103
Yeah, it is. You, too.
Honest to God.

18:09.620 --> 18:12.896
[Parker] It's a bit
of a surprise to see Rick.
We have a lot of history.

18:13.965 --> 18:15.827
The one thing
that really bugs me, though,

18:15.862 --> 18:20.103
is for him to say,
"I gave you my best years."

18:20.137 --> 18:22.620
Basically that his best years
are behind him.

18:22.655 --> 18:24.413
That, to me, is crazy.

18:24.448 --> 18:30.724
I'm like, "You're 42,
and you're talking
like you're 90."

18:32.758 --> 18:35.103
Business is tough enough
when you're in a really
good headspace

18:35.137 --> 18:37.103
and in a decent place
in your life.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.310
I hope he gets doing better.

18:45.517 --> 18:47.068
[Rick grunts]

18:47.103 --> 18:49.068
[Rick] It was really good
to catch up with Parker.

18:51.655 --> 18:53.137
The biggest problem
I have now though

18:53.172 --> 18:56.344
is that this loader
is five hours away
from my claim

18:56.379 --> 18:58.862
and it's over highway
and the road bans are on
right now.

19:00.379 --> 19:02.068
[narrator]
During the spring thaw,

19:02.103 --> 19:06.275
the ground in the Yukon
becomes soft and unstable.

19:06.310 --> 19:11.068
Any heavy weight
on the public highways
can destroy them.

19:11.103 --> 19:16.000
So the government
bans heavy loads
until the ground stabilizes.

19:18.379 --> 19:20.965
[Rick] There's no hauling
heavy equipment at the moment,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.620
and I don't have time
to wait two or three weeks
for road bans to come off,

19:24.655 --> 19:26.448
I need gold now.

19:26.482 --> 19:29.000
So at this moment,
I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do.

19:41.551 --> 19:43.068
[Tony speaking]

19:56.724 --> 19:58.896
[narrator] Just three weeks
into the season,

19:58.931 --> 20:01.448
King of the Klondike,
Tony Beets,

20:01.482 --> 20:04.068
is making a major pivot.

20:04.103 --> 20:08.344
With no gold coming in
at his Paradise Hill
operation,

20:08.379 --> 20:11.551
he's made the call
to put it on hold

20:11.586 --> 20:16.034
and move 40 miles
to his Indian River claims.

20:16.517 --> 20:17.517
[Tony speaking]

20:33.965 --> 20:38.137
[narrator] Four years ago,
the Beets lost their license
on their Indian River claims.

20:38.896 --> 20:40.206
We don't have
a water license.

20:45.793 --> 20:49.344
[narrator] Now,
they've got permission
to mine there again...

20:49.379 --> 20:50.655
We're good to go
to the Indian River.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.103
[Tony speaking]

20:54.137 --> 20:57.586
[narrator]
...giving the family
a much needed lifeline.

20:58.413 --> 21:00.413
[Tony speaking]

21:03.689 --> 21:05.482
[narrator] To get on the gold,

21:05.517 --> 21:10.137
Tony is moving
their entire operation
back to the Indian River.

21:10.172 --> 21:11.000
First step...

21:14.068 --> 21:16.137
move all the heavy equipment.

21:18.241 --> 21:19.482
[Tony speaking]

21:22.724 --> 21:23.965
[Mike] Everything
was up on the hill,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.310
so we have to move
everything back,

21:27.000 --> 21:29.344
get everything set up.
It's literally almost like
starting from zero.

21:37.586 --> 21:38.586
[Tony] Whoa!

21:44.241 --> 21:45.206
[Tony speaking]

22:02.793 --> 22:03.793
[Tony speaking]

22:11.206 --> 22:13.344
[Mike] Okay, well,
have a fun trip, Dad.

22:13.379 --> 22:14.137
[Tony speaking]

22:21.551 --> 22:22.655
[honks horn]

22:24.551 --> 22:25.413
[Tony speaking]

22:37.068 --> 22:39.034
[narrator]
From Paradise Hill,

22:39.068 --> 22:42.827
Tony's convoy must travel
40 miles south,

22:42.862 --> 22:44.551
across muddy backroads...

22:46.586 --> 22:49.413
ending with
a steep 20-degree climb

22:49.448 --> 22:52.137
to the top
of the Hunker Summit

22:52.172 --> 22:53.931
at over 3,000 feet.

22:55.172 --> 22:57.655
Then move down Sulphur,

22:57.689 --> 23:01.862
a dangerous, narrow,
winding trek

23:01.896 --> 23:07.931
till it reaches its final
destination and new home,
Indian River.

23:28.103 --> 23:28.896
Oh.

23:32.413 --> 23:35.448
[narrator] Up ahead,
Tony Beets' youngest son,
Mike,

23:35.482 --> 23:37.896
pays close attention
to the road.

23:40.068 --> 23:42.896
Last year,
it was along this same route

23:42.931 --> 23:46.931
that he transported
his father's 25-ton
wash plant.

23:54.310 --> 23:55.172
[bleep]

24:03.241 --> 24:04.275
[grunts]

24:15.172 --> 24:17.344
I couldn't get it
to come out of gear
fast enough

24:17.379 --> 24:20.551
to drop a gear
so I ended up [bleep]
losing all my momentum.

24:20.586 --> 24:22.620
Uh, if you back up,
I can make another run up.

24:45.034 --> 24:47.275
[engine revving]

24:57.379 --> 24:58.586
[truck thumps]

25:04.413 --> 25:06.758
I'm literally sliding
to the side.

25:09.655 --> 25:11.241
Nope. 'Cause I will
fall off the hill.

25:13.034 --> 25:14.000
I've done this a while.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.896
Don't try to tell me
how to do my [bleep] job.

25:24.241 --> 25:26.448
I'm literally sliding
to the side.

25:32.931 --> 25:35.310
[narrator] On the road
to Indian River,

25:35.344 --> 25:38.000
Mike Beets' 15-ton semi

25:38.034 --> 25:42.137
is stuck on a steep incline
at the top of Hunker Summit.

25:44.827 --> 25:46.448
I'm literally getting
pulled off the hill.

25:46.482 --> 25:47.344
I'm sliding off the hill.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.586
[Tony speaking]

25:58.689 --> 26:00.206
I have nothing.

26:00.241 --> 26:02.862
I am sliding off the hill.

26:02.896 --> 26:04.551
Sliding to the right.

26:04.586 --> 26:06.586
I am sliding.
This is my problem.

26:30.896 --> 26:32.241
[engine revving]

26:43.206 --> 26:44.482
Let's keep going.

26:44.517 --> 26:45.758
[Tony speaking]

27:21.448 --> 27:24.137
[Mike] My dad will
always micromanage
till the day he dies.

27:28.206 --> 27:29.827
[Tony speaking]

27:50.620 --> 27:54.965
[narrator] Four years after
they were forced to abandon
Indian River...

27:59.379 --> 28:02.241
...the Beets family
is finally back.

28:02.793 --> 28:04.620
[horn tooting]

28:12.896 --> 28:15.310
[Tony speaking]

28:15.344 --> 28:17.137
-Yes.
-[Tony speaking]

28:38.000 --> 28:39.482
[man grunts]

28:42.482 --> 28:44.206
[Tony speaking]

29:07.137 --> 29:08.896
[Rick] Sun's out,
snow's gone.

29:08.931 --> 29:11.620
It's prime time
to be sluicing,
and we're shut down.

29:11.655 --> 29:12.896
We blew a front tire
on that loader,

29:12.931 --> 29:14.689
and I need a loader
to feed my plant.

29:16.344 --> 29:19.758
[narrator] Rick Ness'
operation is at a standstill,

29:19.793 --> 29:23.448
losing $8,000 a day
in gold production.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.206
[Rick] I got
the loader I need,

29:26.241 --> 29:28.758
but unfortunately,
I can't get it to my claim
at the moment.

29:28.793 --> 29:30.068
And there's road bans on
in the spring.

29:30.103 --> 29:31.137
That's just how it works.

29:31.172 --> 29:32.724
You know, until the
spring thaw is done,

29:32.758 --> 29:34.103
there is no hauling
heavy equipment.

29:35.068 --> 29:36.862
But I just got
a phone call.

29:36.896 --> 29:38.758
Apparently,
this guy has got a trailer,

29:38.793 --> 29:41.206
and he says
he's got axles on it,
which distributes the weight.

29:41.241 --> 29:42.862
And he can get away
with hauling heavy [bleep].

29:44.137 --> 29:46.689
[narrator] Rick has
hired haulage specialist...

29:46.724 --> 29:49.517
-Oh, there you are.
-...Derek Mamic,

29:49.551 --> 29:52.931
and meets him
outside Parker's
Dominion Creek claim.

29:52.965 --> 29:54.896
[Rick]
Look at this [bleep] rig.

29:54.931 --> 29:56.724
I've been sitting here
wondering, you know,

29:56.758 --> 30:00.310
how much [bleep] lag time
I'm gonna have with [bleep]
road bans.

30:00.344 --> 30:02.793
[Derek] I specifically
built this setup

30:02.827 --> 30:04.172
to get gear moved
at road ban season.

30:04.206 --> 30:05.517
Okay.

30:05.551 --> 30:08.103
[Derek] I got a tridem jeep.

30:08.137 --> 30:09.758
It pins off
into a tandem jeep.

30:11.034 --> 30:13.758
Tridem trailer,
tridem booster.

30:13.793 --> 30:16.172
You can put 85 ton
on this trailer

30:16.206 --> 30:19.172
-and go down
the highway legally.
-[bleep]

30:20.689 --> 30:25.034
[narrator] The custom made
million-dollar trailer's
11 axles

30:25.068 --> 30:29.448
can easily
distribute the weight
of Rick's 35-ton loader

30:29.482 --> 30:33.448
across all of its
136 foot length,

30:33.482 --> 30:36.896
reducing its impact
on the highway's surface,

30:36.931 --> 30:40.655
allowing the heavy load
to travel during
the road bans.

30:44.241 --> 30:45.862
[Rick] Impressive.

30:45.896 --> 30:47.206
Good for me
that you're up here.

30:47.241 --> 30:49.068
-[Derek] Yeah, you're saving
a month there for sure.
-Yeah.

30:49.103 --> 30:50.620
Well, we've got
20 hours of light,

30:50.655 --> 30:52.586
so let's get
the [bleep] at it, eh?

30:52.620 --> 30:53.724
Let's do this.

31:01.103 --> 31:03.344
[Derek] I'll four-corner
chain it down.

31:04.724 --> 31:06.896
Okay, after he's done, Ricky,
we're ready to go.

31:06.931 --> 31:09.241
Right on, man.
It's [bleep] awesome.

31:09.931 --> 31:11.068
You guys gonna hit the road?

31:11.103 --> 31:12.724
-[man] Oh, yeah.
-[Rick] All right.

31:12.758 --> 31:15.172
-Awesome. Thanks, man.
-[Rick] See you there.
Yeah, thank you.

31:17.413 --> 31:19.172
There we go.

31:19.206 --> 31:21.896
Next time I see that loader,
it's gonna be in Keno,

31:21.931 --> 31:23.620
scooping up buckets of gold.

31:40.172 --> 31:42.206
[Rick] Things are great.
Sun's shining.

31:42.241 --> 31:44.482
We're about to get
a full day of sluicing in.
A full day!

31:45.827 --> 31:48.551
This loader
is a major step up.
It's exactly what I need.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.310
[narrator]
After a two-day shut down,

31:52.344 --> 31:55.275
Rick Ness has had
a new loader delivered.

31:56.344 --> 31:58.517
And his only other
crew member, Morgan,

31:58.551 --> 32:01.551
is back loading
gold-rich paydirt.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.241
Pretty thankful
that Rick was able

32:04.275 --> 32:06.758
to strike a deal with Parker
for this loader.

32:06.793 --> 32:10.034
It is gonna make this
so much easier out here.

32:10.068 --> 32:12.931
It feels like we're actually
up and running now.

32:12.965 --> 32:19.034
Just with this one loader,
it completely feels like
it changed everything.

32:19.068 --> 32:22.034
[Rick] This loader is
gonna be a lot more
productive for us so...

32:22.689 --> 32:24.000
It's a big deal here.

32:25.655 --> 32:26.896
Hey, thanks, Parker.

32:36.241 --> 32:39.172
[Chris]
We have nothing coming in,
everything going out.

32:39.206 --> 32:40.241
We're going broke.

32:40.275 --> 32:42.827
We need to get
a cash flow going.

32:42.862 --> 32:44.000
Anything could help
right now.

32:45.586 --> 32:47.137
[narrator]
At Dominion Creek,

32:47.172 --> 32:49.379
with Parker
hemorrhaging money,

32:49.413 --> 32:53.241
gold recovery expert
Chris Doumitt hatches a plan

32:53.275 --> 32:56.551
to bring in
the claim's first gold.

32:56.586 --> 33:01.000
So, in the process of, uh,
cleaning up the Dominion Creek
gold room,

33:01.034 --> 33:02.034
I found this.

33:03.793 --> 33:05.103
There's gold
in the fine tailings.

33:06.068 --> 33:08.206
[narrator]
Tailings are waste dirt

33:08.241 --> 33:11.068
left over after
the gold is separated

33:11.103 --> 33:13.862
and are dumped
outside the gold room.

33:13.896 --> 33:16.068
I'm gonna grab the mini hoe,
dig it up,

33:16.103 --> 33:17.379
run it through my equipment

33:17.413 --> 33:19.655
and then, hopefully,
we'll get some gold.

33:23.379 --> 33:25.793
[Parker] The only thing
that matters right now
is stripping.

33:25.827 --> 33:27.793
One of the
big challenges for us

33:27.827 --> 33:29.965
is that this ground
is a fair bit deeper

33:30.000 --> 33:32.034
than what we've been mining.

33:32.068 --> 33:33.655
[narrator] In the Money Pit,

33:33.689 --> 33:36.586
Parker and his crew
have just three days

33:36.620 --> 33:40.379
to strip and clear
a four-acre area

33:40.413 --> 33:42.586
of melting overburden.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.241
By getting stripped ahead,

33:45.275 --> 33:47.827
you can let the sun fall
on that gravel now,

33:47.862 --> 33:51.482
and your costs go down 30%.

33:54.413 --> 33:56.172
[narrator]
To speed things up,

33:56.206 --> 34:01.034
Parker has two dozers
ripping overburden 24-7,

34:01.068 --> 34:05.793
and two excavators loading it
into four rock trucks
to remove it.

34:10.551 --> 34:13.172
With the amount of gear
that we have here,

34:13.206 --> 34:15.827
I mean, we go through
truckloads of fuel here.

34:15.862 --> 34:22.862
The D11s alone would use
probably 1,200 to 1,500 liters
of fuel per shift.

34:22.896 --> 34:25.896
I'm actually getting
quite low on fuel myself now.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.688
Liam, Liam, got a copy?

34:28.724 --> 34:31.310
-Liam.
-Yes, I do.

34:31.344 --> 34:33.551
Yeah, man.
Are you far away
with the fuel truck?

34:33.585 --> 34:37.000
I'm gonna need fuel
very, very soon.

34:37.896 --> 34:38.896
[Liam] Yup. Truck right away.

34:39.757 --> 34:41.620
[narrator]
Fuel truck driver Liam

34:41.655 --> 34:44.585
keeps the crew's equipment
fueled up and running.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.688
The dozers have been running
absolutely crazy

34:46.724 --> 34:49.206
since, uh, we started
our stripping program.

34:49.241 --> 34:52.310
And these guys are absolutely
ripping through the fuel.

34:52.344 --> 34:54.000
And if I can't get fuel
down to the cut,

34:54.034 --> 34:55.688
the operation stops
in its tracks

34:55.724 --> 34:58.000
'cause everything,
everything runs off fuel here.

35:01.172 --> 35:01.965
Man.

35:09.620 --> 35:12.482
There is absolutely no way
I'm gonna be crossing this.

35:13.758 --> 35:15.724
Hey, Mitch,
do you have a copy?

35:15.758 --> 35:19.758
We have a serious problem
here with our road.

35:19.793 --> 35:21.931
[Mitch] Yeah.
What's going on?

35:21.965 --> 35:24.137
[Liam] Pond has completely
run over the road

35:24.172 --> 35:27.586
and into the opposing pond
across from it.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.379
[Mitch] All right.
I'll be there in a minute.

35:29.413 --> 35:31.724
[Liam]
All right, thank you.

35:31.758 --> 35:35.931
[narrator] If Liam
can't get across the only
road into the cut,

35:35.965 --> 35:38.724
the stripping crew
will run out of fuel

35:38.758 --> 35:42.034
and fail to hit
Parker's three-day deadline,

35:42.068 --> 35:45.551
costing tens of thousands
Parker doesn't have.

35:52.379 --> 35:53.586
That's not good.

35:55.586 --> 35:57.517
Well, that escalated quickly.

35:59.965 --> 36:01.275
'Cause everything's
heating up,

36:01.310 --> 36:02.827
all the snow's melting off,

36:02.862 --> 36:06.448
and this road system here
clearly wasn't built
high enough.

36:06.482 --> 36:07.758
So now we're, uh...

36:09.379 --> 36:11.965
Yeah, pretty well screwed.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.344
With all that
water flowing here
and how deep this is,

36:14.379 --> 36:16.965
uh, that truck gets out there,
it's gonna sink out of sight.

36:26.689 --> 36:31.103
Hey, Kayden, I need you
to get the 750 over to that
gravel pile and, uh, trucks.

36:31.137 --> 36:33.827
Just get over there.
We need a bunch of material
down here in the roadway.

36:33.862 --> 36:36.000
Everybody out here.
And put a hustle on it.

36:36.034 --> 36:38.827
Right on, Mitch.
We're coming.

36:38.862 --> 36:40.724
We'll be out there
as fast as we can.

36:42.758 --> 36:44.517
[Mitch]
We'd rather have the trucks
moving mud right now

36:44.551 --> 36:46.517
than, uh, building roads,

36:46.551 --> 36:47.965
but nothing's
gonna be happening

36:48.000 --> 36:49.586
if there's no fuel truck
out in the cut.

36:50.965 --> 36:53.965
We are fortunate
that the wash plant has
lots of rock over there.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.413
So we're gonna start
bombing it this way,
start filling this in.

36:57.448 --> 36:58.551
[narrator]
The heavy equipment

36:58.586 --> 37:00.413
threatening to
run out of fuel,

37:00.448 --> 37:04.068
Mitch diverts
the rock trucks
from stripping

37:04.103 --> 37:06.862
to build up the road
with coarse rocks

37:06.896 --> 37:08.965
from an old tailings pile.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.793
[Mitch]
That's good right there.
Keep building that side in.

37:10.827 --> 37:12.068
We gotta get
one lane through here.

37:14.793 --> 37:16.206
Need a little bit more
on the right side.

37:16.241 --> 37:19.482
-Keep sending trucks, Kayden.
We got a big hole to fill.
-Yeah.

37:19.517 --> 37:21.551
Just keep whaling away.

37:21.586 --> 37:23.310
[Jacob]
The faster we bust out
this road, the better,

37:23.344 --> 37:25.379
'cause there's a lot to do
in the cut right now.

37:29.758 --> 37:31.103
All righty.
That will do her.

37:33.586 --> 37:34.862
Here we go.

37:41.655 --> 37:43.655
I made it through,
and fuel's gonna get
to the cut.

37:43.689 --> 37:45.034
All righty.

37:45.068 --> 37:47.517
Very nice, everybody.
Trucks, head out to the cut.

37:47.551 --> 37:50.413
And nice job.
Uh, she's working for now.

37:50.448 --> 37:51.931
Liam, where are you, man?

37:51.965 --> 37:54.275
I need you here now.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.275
What took you so long?

38:04.310 --> 38:06.275
Damn, that was a close call.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.896
She is dry.

38:11.689 --> 38:13.655
So everybody
finally got fueled up.

38:13.689 --> 38:15.482
So, it's full steam ahead.

38:15.517 --> 38:17.689
And hopefully,
we make this deadline.

38:32.379 --> 38:37.517
So this is gold that I found
from around outside
of the gold room.

38:37.551 --> 38:39.172
What I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna melt this down

38:39.206 --> 38:41.344
and make
little bars out of it.

38:45.379 --> 38:46.965
I'm hoping for...

38:48.068 --> 38:50.034
seven, maybe eight ounces
of gold.

39:01.068 --> 39:02.137
It's still pretty hot.

39:04.103 --> 39:05.413
You got yourself a gold bar.

39:12.758 --> 39:14.344
You know, in the big picture,

39:15.344 --> 39:17.758
it's just a drop
in the bucket.

39:17.793 --> 39:19.137
But you're never
gonna fill a bucket

39:19.172 --> 39:20.620
if you don't start
with one drop.

39:29.275 --> 39:31.241
[Mitch] Hey, everybody,
that's awesome.

39:31.275 --> 39:33.448
Three days, we got
a hell of a lot of work done.

39:34.827 --> 39:37.827
[narrator] Parker's crew
has hit their deadline

39:37.862 --> 39:40.758
and stripped
the next four acres
of the Money Pit

39:40.793 --> 39:42.344
in just three days.

39:42.379 --> 39:44.448
Really happy with
how this system's working.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.275
We just gotta keep it up.

39:52.344 --> 39:54.172
[Parker] Is it too early
for a beer? Yeah?

39:54.206 --> 39:56.137
[Chris] It's noon, yeah.

39:56.172 --> 39:57.758
-How's it going, young man?
-Good. How are you?

39:57.793 --> 39:58.586
[Chris] Good.

40:02.448 --> 40:05.000
-[Parker] So, how you been?
-Good. Really good. Busy.

40:05.034 --> 40:07.448
Everybody's busy
'cause we have to get
stripped ahead.

40:07.482 --> 40:11.448
I know that we've never
spent money like this before.

40:11.482 --> 40:13.620
You know, we're... we're

40:14.931 --> 40:17.586
-spending it
as fast as we can.
-Yeah.

40:17.620 --> 40:19.482
How are you handling that?

40:19.517 --> 40:21.310
-It's just a lot.
-Yeah.

40:21.344 --> 40:24.310
Hopefully we can do,
you know, some decent
gold this year.

40:24.344 --> 40:26.965
If we can do,
like, 5,000 ounces,

40:27.000 --> 40:30.724
then I can keep
the debt load down, kind of,
in the five million range.

40:32.689 --> 40:36.206
[Chris] While you were out
digging the dirt
looking for gold,

40:36.241 --> 40:42.206
I dug up all the, uh,
tailings from, uh,
this gold room.

40:42.241 --> 40:43.931
-[Parker] Uh-huh.
-I ran 'em.

40:43.965 --> 40:46.931
So I was able
to capture something for ya.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.172
There you go, buddy.
Check this out.

40:50.206 --> 40:52.965
Look at that. Cool.
How much do those weigh?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.206
[Chris]
They're close to an ounce.

40:55.827 --> 40:57.275
There's a little
over nine ounces there.

40:57.310 --> 40:58.896
-Really?
-Yeah.

40:58.931 --> 40:59.793
[Parker] Nice!

40:59.827 --> 41:03.068
[narrator] Worth $18,000,

41:03.103 --> 41:05.413
Parker's first
Dominion Creek gold.

41:06.793 --> 41:08.896
There you go, man.
That's a start, right?

41:08.931 --> 41:10.310
[Parker chuckling]

41:11.241 --> 41:13.413
Yeah, yeah,
that's a start, but...

41:15.034 --> 41:16.620
We need to bring in,
like, ten million bucks.

41:18.206 --> 41:21.689
We do that, what,
six hundred more times,
we'll have it.

41:34.551 --> 41:38.344
[narrator] With all of
Tony's heavy equipment
finally at Indian River,

41:38.379 --> 41:41.448
he takes daughter, Monica,
to evaluate the condition

41:41.482 --> 41:42.896
of his dredge.

41:46.758 --> 41:49.448
And determine if they can
get it up and running.

41:55.965 --> 41:57.482
[Tony speaking]

41:58.379 --> 42:00.241
-[Monica] Oh, guarantee.
-[Tony speaking]

42:01.379 --> 42:02.827
[Monica] Yeah.

42:02.862 --> 42:06.931
[narrator] Tony plans to run
a shaker deck wash plant
at Indian.

42:06.965 --> 42:10.172
But if the dredge is capable
of running as well,

42:10.206 --> 42:12.206
it could double
his gold haul.

42:12.241 --> 42:13.965
[Tony speaking]

43:01.068 --> 43:02.689
[Monica] Oh, yeah,
there is three flakes.

43:08.586 --> 43:09.689
[Monica] Beauty.

43:09.724 --> 43:12.344
-[Tony speaking]
-[Monica] Yeah.

43:12.379 --> 43:15.068
Now get the thing running
so I can see it actually
cleaning it.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.793
[Rick] Oh, yeah.

43:38.896 --> 43:40.655
There's some chunky
stuff in there, too.
You see that?

43:40.689 --> 43:43.241
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah, I like it.

43:43.275 --> 43:44.793
Hey, man, that's a lot
of gold for two people.

43:44.827 --> 43:46.655
-Yeah, I'm excited about this.
-Yeah.

43:46.689 --> 43:48.551
Well, with what we had
to deal with this week, too,

43:48.586 --> 43:50.965
the loader tire blowing out,
that sucked.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.103
But Parker was actually
pretty good about that.

43:54.103 --> 43:55.793
I'm happy
I went to see him.

43:55.827 --> 43:58.620
-Should we weigh it?
-Yeah. Ready?

43:58.655 --> 44:00.551
I'll let you do
the honors here.

44:00.586 --> 44:03.379
-[Rick] All right,
let's do this.
-All right.

44:03.413 --> 44:07.655
We've got one,
two, four, seven.

44:07.689 --> 44:12.862
[narrator]
Rick's first week of running
delivered 21.2 ounces.

44:12.896 --> 44:18.068
To cover costs,
he needs to hit another
20 ounces this week.

44:18.103 --> 44:19.689
Seventeen, nineteen.

44:19.724 --> 44:22.482
20.73.

44:22.517 --> 44:25.896
[narrator] Worth $42,000.

44:25.931 --> 44:29.241
Taking his total
to 42 ounces,

44:29.275 --> 44:32.000
allowing Rick
to run another week,

44:32.034 --> 44:34.620
keeping his season alive.

44:34.655 --> 44:36.275
That's not bad.

44:36.310 --> 44:38.310
I mean, it's just
the two of us here.

44:38.344 --> 44:41.896
You know, I knew that
that pay pile does not have
a ton of gold in it.

44:41.931 --> 44:43.620
But to get 20 ounces
of gold out of that,

44:43.655 --> 44:46.275
just the two of us,
in, like, what, three days?

44:46.310 --> 44:47.206
Hell yeah.

44:47.241 --> 44:48.620
All we need to do now,
we need to get

44:48.655 --> 44:50.448
some more people in here,
some more equipment.

44:50.482 --> 44:52.137
We'll blast through
that pay pile.

44:52.172 --> 44:53.758
And then, uh, we'll move on
to the next cut.

44:53.793 --> 44:56.172
But, you know,
if we can keep gold
coming in like that all year,

44:56.206 --> 44:57.517
I think we'll get
to 1,000 ounces.

44:57.551 --> 44:58.620
Oh, yeah, I'm excited.

44:58.655 --> 45:00.448
-[Rick] Yep.
-Yay!

45:00.482 --> 45:01.655
Well, what do you say?

45:01.689 --> 45:03.206
-[bleep] great week
as far as I'm concerned.
-Yeah.

45:03.241 --> 45:04.551
-I'll put this away.
-Awesome.

45:04.586 --> 45:06.344
-[Rick] Let's get
the hell out of here.
-Sweet.
