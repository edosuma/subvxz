[theme music]

00:11.545 --> 00:12.413
Oh, hi.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.482
I'm Bev Harris's daughter.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.683
Is she OK?

00:15.716 --> 00:18.486
Yes, it's just a hairline
fracture in the pelvis.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.221
We're releasing her tonight.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.223
Just make sure she
gets plenty of rest

00:22.256 --> 00:25.693
while she's at your house.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.861
At our house?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.730
Yes, Mrs. Harris told us
she'd be staying with you

00:29.763 --> 00:31.332
during her convalescence.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.301
That's great.

00:33.334 --> 00:36.737
The love of one's family is
often the most powerful remedy.

00:41.642 --> 00:42.443
She's a goner.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.148
Roseanne, that woman is
not staying at our house.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.549
Oh please, Dan.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.451
Please can I have the most
horrible woman in the world

00:50.484 --> 00:51.685
living in my house?
Please?

00:51.719 --> 00:52.420
Please?
Please?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.054
Listen to me, Roseanne.

00:54.088 --> 00:57.825
Her retirement home is set up
to handle injured old people.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.360
When you go in there,
you are not allowed

00:59.393 --> 01:02.029
to let her give you any guilt.
- All right, Dan.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.933
I can deflect mom's guilt rays
as long as I have an outlet.

01:05.966 --> 01:06.900
Ow.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.802
Oh, I better clip these.

01:11.739 --> 01:12.606
Hi, mom.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.674
How are you?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.776
Oh, hello, Roseanne.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.078
We came by the apartment
to help you move that couch

01:18.112 --> 01:19.813
and they told us you were here.

01:19.847 --> 01:20.981
Oh, that's right.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.183
Well, don't worry.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.452
Even if you had arrived
on time, I probably

01:24.485 --> 01:26.154
still would have fallen.

01:26.187 --> 01:28.956
Of course, who knows
what damage was caused

01:28.989 --> 01:31.959
by delaying medical attention.

01:31.992 --> 01:35.329
Well, mom, you know, I called
your house about 100 times

01:35.363 --> 01:37.931
to tell you I was going to be
late but nobody ever answered.

01:37.965 --> 01:41.335
Forgive me, it's hard to reach
the phone when you're shivering

01:41.369 --> 01:43.437
in agony on the shower floor.

01:43.471 --> 01:48.008
Thank god those cleaning
people keep their appointments.

01:48.041 --> 01:50.344
The cleaning people found you?

01:50.378 --> 01:52.280
Well, Bev, maybe we
should let you rest.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.113
Ow.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.085
You know, I feel really
bad about this, mom.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.620
Yes, so do I. Let's go.

01:59.653 --> 02:03.724
And Dan feels even
worse, as you can tell.

02:03.757 --> 02:06.026
Oh, don't blame
yourself, Roseanne.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.961
Besides, you're not
the one who never

02:07.995 --> 02:09.963
got around to putting
those applicators

02:09.997 --> 02:13.434
on my slippery shower floor.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.636
Damn.

02:15.669 --> 02:20.808
Oh my god, Dan
forgot to do that.

02:20.841 --> 02:23.611
Oh man, oh man, oh
man, oh man, oh man.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.879
Well, he was going
to do it last weekend

02:25.913 --> 02:27.080
but he was very busy.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.450
I think there was some
kind of sports program on.

02:32.220 --> 02:36.257
Bev, would you like
to stay at our h--

02:36.290 --> 02:38.592
at our house?

02:38.626 --> 02:41.128
Oh Dan, that's so nice of you.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.663
I graciously accept.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.401
Well, that's just great.

02:47.435 --> 02:51.439
And if you need me for anything,
I'll be staying at mom's.

02:51.472 --> 02:55.376
[music playing]

04:16.757 --> 04:18.892
Please stop watching me.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.261
I'm sorry, am I bothering you?

04:21.295 --> 04:22.195
Yes you are.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.365
Oh, I didn't mean to.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.867
But it's just whenever
I see a men watching one

04:26.900 --> 04:29.370
of these games, I wonder
what could possibly

04:29.403 --> 04:31.772
be going on inside his head.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.974
Oh, you don't want to know.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.643
What's that noise?

04:35.676 --> 04:36.610
That's a tie.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.146
It means they're
going into overtime.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.549
Does that mean
they get paid more?

04:41.582 --> 04:43.551
No, it means--

04:43.584 --> 04:44.918
yes, that's exactly
what it means.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.556
What are you guys watching?

04:48.589 --> 04:49.490
Bulls and Sixers.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.692
Those are basketball teams.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.561
I know.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.464
Well, I really
should take my nap.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.533
Oh, you're not leaving.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.969
But I'll need two
strong men to lift

05:02.002 --> 05:05.406
my tired old legs into bed.

05:05.439 --> 05:06.507
I got to go.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.341
Me too.

05:14.548 --> 05:18.486
You're slow, but
I'll bet you're strong.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.319
Yes.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.757
Come on, hope she
doesn't want us

05:23.791 --> 05:24.858
to apply that ointment again.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.302
Thank you, Dan.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.237
My toes feel much better.

05:50.418 --> 05:53.053
It's your mother's head.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.490
[doorbell rings]

05:56.524 --> 05:58.125
Hello.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.193
Hello, Bev, are you there?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.161
Maybe it's death.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.300
Hey, Jake.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.537
Oh, Roseanne and Jackie.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.438
Am I right?

06:10.471 --> 06:11.772
You're right.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.607
And the fact that you've
seen us both every week

06:13.641 --> 06:15.743
for the last year,
don't let that take

06:15.776 --> 06:19.580
nothing away from your victory.
So, come on in.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.881
Have a seat.
- Yeah.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.015
Thank you.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.117
Listen, I came about Bev.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.653
You want to talk to her?

06:25.686 --> 06:27.655
I'd like to but she
doesn't want to talk to me.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.757
Every time I call
her, she hangs up.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.225
What's your secret?

06:32.259 --> 06:35.095
I know she's embarrassed
about what happened but I

06:35.128 --> 06:36.964
wish she wouldn't be mad at me.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.331
What's there to feel
embarrassed about?

06:38.365 --> 06:40.501
It happens all the time.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.003
Well, it's never
happened to me before.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.440
And Bev looked like it was
the first time for her too.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.708
You were there?

06:47.741 --> 06:48.676
Yes.

06:48.709 --> 06:52.780
She-- she didn't
tell you it was me.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.982
Yeah, well, you know,
she said it was somebody.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.518
But oh, she didn't
say a definite name.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.319
But I knew that it was you.

06:59.352 --> 07:00.954
And I said, oh,
that's go to be Jake.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.957
And remember, Jackie, you go,
oh, that's definitely Jake.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.258
Yeah.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.828
Yeah, well, you know,
Bev, she's so sweet.

07:07.861 --> 07:12.132
But she's so old fashioned when
it comes to intimate things.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.809
Whoa now.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.877
Well you know, Jake,
when my mom confided

07:23.911 --> 07:26.079
in me, she kind of made--

07:26.113 --> 07:28.181
well, she kind of made
you look bad, frankly.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.417
And so why don't you just tell
us your side of the story.

07:34.855 --> 07:38.058
You can leave stuff
out, if you want.

07:38.091 --> 07:42.996
Look, it happened
because, well, it's

07:43.030 --> 07:44.765
been a while for both of us.

07:44.798 --> 07:51.138
And I can't balance
the way I used to.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.508
Oh my god, they were
trying to balance.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.776
Believe me, girls.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.845
I did everything I could.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.113
When we hit the
floor, I just wish it

08:00.147 --> 08:01.448
was me who was on the bottom.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.656
And then I dressed her.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.524
She was naked?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.993
Holy Hannah.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.995
Well, I think she
wouldn't be that mad at me

08:15.028 --> 08:17.497
if those jokers down
at the retirement home

08:17.531 --> 08:20.634
hadn't come up with
that awful nickname.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.370
Yeah, those jerks.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.138
What was it again?

08:25.172 --> 08:27.374
Craftmatic adjustable Bev.

08:36.550 --> 08:39.186
That's very bad.

08:39.219 --> 08:43.691
Roseanne, please, talk--
talk to Bev about this for me,

08:43.724 --> 08:44.958
will you?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.961
God, don't you think it
ought to be you doing it, Jake.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.599
I mean, you know, one on one,
face to face, in the latter.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.499
Please.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.134
Please.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.035
Yeah, all right.

08:55.068 --> 08:55.936
I'll talk to her.

08:55.969 --> 08:56.970
Oh good, thanks.

08:57.004 --> 08:57.871
Thanks.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.506
Boy, I tell you, Bev is lucky.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.208
Bev is lucky.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.844
You girls are the best.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.713
Well.

09:05.746 --> 09:10.150
No, I don't need no
broken pelvis there.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.753
You're funny, just
like your mother.

09:16.323 --> 09:20.293
So, when are you
going to talk to mom?

09:20.327 --> 09:23.196
When I can do it
with a weegee board.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.565
No, no.

09:25.599 --> 09:29.136
Got to do it now, Roseanne,
because she's humiliated.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.871
Unless she works through
it, she's never going to go

09:30.904 --> 09:32.906
back to the retirement home.

09:32.940 --> 09:40.881
Jackie, Jackie I can not
have a talk about sex with mom.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.851
If she even says the
word intercourse,

09:43.884 --> 09:44.952
I'll burst into flames.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.289
Well then do it for Dan.

09:49.322 --> 09:53.226
He thinks the whole thing is his
fault. And you promised Jake.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.494
Little Jake.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.630
Poor old Jake.

09:56.664 --> 09:57.597
God, you're annoying.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.405
BEV: Yes?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.175
Mom, I just want you to
know that if you need to speak

10:08.208 --> 10:10.644
to a doctor, I can arrange it.

10:10.678 --> 10:15.082
BEV: Uh, well, thank you, dear.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.751
I just had the same sex talk
with her that she had with me.

10:23.323 --> 10:26.827
[music playing]

10:27.828 --> 10:30.764
Hey, what are we having?

10:30.798 --> 10:33.233
BEV: Use a little wine
when you poach the fish.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.035
Oh, the fish again?

10:35.068 --> 10:37.504
Oh, it'll be OK.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.509
Roseanne, your mother
is never slipping

10:42.542 --> 10:43.844
and falling down again.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.445
You know why?

10:45.478 --> 10:47.580
Because when she's all
well, I'm sewing [inaudible]

10:47.614 --> 10:50.517
on the bottom of her feet.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.852
Hi, Jackie.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.453
Hi, mom.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.555
Roseanne, I think
on the way over he

10:55.588 --> 10:56.589
made you a little present.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.959
Oh, well every
day is Christmas.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.563
Hello, Bev.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.032
BEV: Hello, Fred.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.666
I think it's wonderful
you're taking your child's

11:06.700 --> 11:08.702
mother out to dinner.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.938
Well, yeah.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.640
BEV: When I had children
I had to scrimp and save.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.675
You're very fortunate.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.145
Well, yeah.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.914
BEV: And when your child asks
why he's not going to college,

11:20.948 --> 11:22.916
just tell him that his
mother had a steak.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.988
I'll be in here with Dan.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.759
Still want to marry
into this family?

11:31.792 --> 11:32.760
Tonight's the night.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.796
Oh my god, it's a ring.

11:35.829 --> 11:39.399
It's the coolest
box, isn't it?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.969
OK, let's go.

11:42.002 --> 11:43.170
Nice seeing you, mom.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.545
What was that?

11:52.579 --> 11:53.981
What?

11:54.014 --> 11:56.083
That, what Fred did.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.052
I don't know.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.489
Why, was it some sort of
secret macho signal thing,

12:02.522 --> 12:03.623
you know?

12:03.656 --> 12:04.958
Like this is supposed
to be Jackie's breast

12:04.992 --> 12:06.693
and he's trying to tell
you that he's going to get

12:06.726 --> 12:08.461
some action tonight, that pig.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.700
Trust me, Roseanne, the
gesture was not dirty.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.103
So what was it?

12:16.136 --> 12:17.905
I don't know.

12:17.938 --> 12:18.738
OK, fine.

12:23.110 --> 12:26.379
I'll tell you what,
if you don't tell me

12:26.413 --> 12:28.715
what that gesture
meant, it's your turn

12:28.748 --> 12:31.018
to give mom her sits bath.

12:31.051 --> 12:31.852
Geez.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.725
If I tell you, you got to
swear to keep your mouth shut.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.295
God, I can't believe that you
don't even trust your own wife.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.497
OK, I promise.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.967
Fred was pointing to the
ring he bought because he's

12:47.000 --> 12:48.635
going to propose tonight.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.704
Oh my god, he's going
to propose to her?

12:51.738 --> 12:52.605
Mmhmm.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.807
Did you see the ring?

12:53.841 --> 12:54.707
Yeah.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.144
So what did it look like?

12:57.177 --> 12:58.245
I have no idea.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.380
What kind of setting
did he have it in?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.281
I have no idea.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.984
Was it a diamond?

13:04.017 --> 13:06.353
I have no idea.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.787
God, this is so amazing.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.657
Well, look, I swore I
wouldn't tell anybody,

13:10.690 --> 13:11.859
so you got to keep
your mouth shut.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.926
- I will.
- I mean it.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.227
- I will.
- I mean it.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.062
I will.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.333
Hi.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.434
Hi.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.502
Hello, little one, hello, hello.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.811
God, that was hard.

13:31.845 --> 13:35.648
[music playing]

13:38.185 --> 13:40.487
They left that restaurant
an hour and a half ago.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.654
How come they're late?

13:41.688 --> 13:45.325
Well, maybe her and
Fred are out celebrating.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.094
They just had a baby,
they are not medically

13:47.127 --> 13:50.130
allowed to celebrate yet.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.700
Roseanne, Dan, we
came back because I've

13:53.733 --> 13:55.568
got some really big news.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.904
Oh yeah?

13:56.937 --> 14:01.108
Yeah, Roseanne, Dan, Fred
and I are moving in together.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.083
You're what?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.551
Yeah, we're going
to live together.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.986
Isn't that great?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.490
Yeah.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.491
Aren't you happy for us?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.428
Oh yeah, we're really happy.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.931
I'm really happy and
really surprised.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.198
Like really surprised.

14:25.232 --> 14:28.035
Me too!

14:28.068 --> 14:31.838
My heavens, what's
all the ruckus?

14:31.871 --> 14:35.342
Mom, I've got some news
that I think is going to make

14:35.375 --> 14:36.609
you really, really happy.

14:36.643 --> 14:40.680
But Fred convinced me
to tell you anyway.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.150
I know, you're getting
married, Congratulations.

14:43.183 --> 14:44.051
No, mom.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.788
We're moving in together.

14:48.821 --> 14:51.558
God, why every time
I have big news

14:51.591 --> 14:54.761
you ruin it by guessing
that it's even bigger news.

14:54.794 --> 14:58.531
No, I don't, it's just,
well, that's what Dan said.

15:01.969 --> 15:06.506
You told your mother-in-law.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.707
Of course not.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.842
I told my wife.

15:09.876 --> 15:13.580
God, mom, can't you
ever keep a secret?

15:13.613 --> 15:16.449
Wait a minute.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.885
You were going to propose?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.820
It had crossed my mind.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.956
And what made it uncross?

15:22.990 --> 15:26.559
What made you go from asking
me to share my life with you

15:26.593 --> 15:30.964
to asking me to split the rent?

15:30.998 --> 15:34.601
Well, I don't know about
you guys, but I blame mom.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.503
Well, you shouldn't blame me.

15:36.536 --> 15:40.974
If Fred doesn't have the courage
to make Jackie an honest woman,

15:41.008 --> 15:44.111
then perhaps it's best
Jackie found that out.

15:44.144 --> 15:47.814
Hey Bev, do yourself a big
favor, don't get into this.

15:47.847 --> 15:50.650
Fred, I have every right
to be involved in this.

15:50.683 --> 15:54.287
Unlike you, I am actually
a member of this family.

15:54.321 --> 15:57.257
Well, if I ever do become
a member of this family,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.626
I can tell you one thing
right now, the next time you

15:59.659 --> 16:01.228
break your pelvis
having sex, you're

16:01.261 --> 16:02.529
not going to stay at our house.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.804
If I understand
this correctly,

16:11.838 --> 16:14.541
unless you had sex in
the shower, none of this

16:14.574 --> 16:21.514
is my fault.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.050
Guess I wasn't
supposed to say that.

16:27.954 --> 16:33.826
No, I plan to treat Bev
with the utmost sensitivity.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.928
But first a raucous laugh.

16:39.399 --> 16:44.104
[music playing]

16:47.107 --> 16:48.508
Hi, mom.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.310
Well, I heard what happened.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.413
So do you want to talk about it?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.382
What's left to talk about?

16:55.415 --> 16:58.017
Everybody already knows
all of the details

16:58.051 --> 17:02.222
of the most humiliating
experience of my life, Fred,

17:02.255 --> 17:04.224
Dan, you, Jackie.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.926
Oh wait, there's little DJ.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.895
What a shame he
had to miss this.

17:08.928 --> 17:11.631
You'll catch him
up, won't you dear?

17:11.664 --> 17:14.567
So everybody knows
you had sex, big deal.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.768
It's not like you
got in an accident

17:15.802 --> 17:18.471
wearing dirty old underpants.

17:18.505 --> 17:22.041
Well, it will
never happen again.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.343
I can tell you that much.

17:23.376 --> 17:27.580
Oh mom, now you
never were a quitter.

17:27.614 --> 17:31.118
I had one attempt with Jake
and I almost killed myself.

17:31.151 --> 17:35.188
And of course with your father
it was always a disaster.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.022
Oh god.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.895
But you probably don't
want to talk about this.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.764
Oh no, it's not--

17:44.797 --> 17:45.832
it's not that.

17:45.865 --> 17:48.801
I just think you
probably more comfortable

17:48.835 --> 17:50.170
talking to your friends.

17:50.203 --> 17:53.340
My friends?

17:53.373 --> 17:54.274
Yes, you're right.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.408
I should talk to my friends.

17:58.811 --> 18:02.182
Well, I mean unless you want
to talk to me, then you know,

18:02.215 --> 18:04.484
I'm here for you.

18:04.517 --> 18:11.090
So I guess, the thing is,
you've never really had

18:11.124 --> 18:19.098
any good sexual experiences.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.101
Well, your father
was good in the sense

18:22.135 --> 18:24.537
that he never took longer
than the commercials.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.245
That's terrible.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.880
Love making is for me.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.515
They enjoy it, very much.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.284
But I'd just as
soon be knitting.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.455
Well, it can be
enjoyable for you, mom.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.790
It can be really enjoyable.

18:43.823 --> 18:44.924
You know?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.859
All you really need is
just to have a partner

18:46.893 --> 18:49.629
who is giving and caring.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.299
And I really think
that Jake is like that.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.566
So you like it?

19:03.243 --> 19:04.377
Yeah, Mom, I like it.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.451
Well, I don't think
I'll ever enjoy it.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.354
Oh yeah, all you've got
to do is just tell the man

19:14.387 --> 19:16.723
what you like and
what you don't like.

19:16.756 --> 19:20.893
Didn't do anything that,
you know, that you liked?

19:20.927 --> 19:21.728
Yes.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.537
Do you want to
tell me what it was.

19:30.570 --> 19:39.512
Well, he rubbed my shoulders.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.180
Well, that's really nice.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.515
That's good.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.817
Well, you should tell him,
you know, that you enjoy that.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.054
And then later you can
tell him, you know,

19:48.087 --> 19:50.022
more intimate things
that you like.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.926
Well, I never had a
chance to learn what I like.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.996
That's really, really sad.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.665
Well you know,
maybe it would help

19:58.698 --> 20:00.132
if you tell me what you like.

20:10.543 --> 20:15.081
Um, I like it when Dan
rubs my shoulders, too.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.083
Just like you.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.918
Isn't that funny?

20:18.951 --> 20:19.752
What are the odds?

20:22.422 --> 20:26.426
So this is what it's
like to be a modern woman?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.361
Oh, I would have
been so uncomfortable

20:28.395 --> 20:31.364
having this conversation
with my mother.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.000
It's amazing how
things have changed.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.139
[music playing]

20:41.674 --> 20:43.776
JAKE: Bev, that was marvelous.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.945
BEV: You're very
giving and caring.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.214
And you really worked
out that balance problem.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.987
JAKE: You seem so much freer and
so much more sure of yourself.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.423
BEV: Well, I talked
to my daughter

20:56.456 --> 21:00.092
and she told me not to be
afraid to ask for what I want.

21:00.126 --> 21:04.163
So you know, Jake, I
wouldn't mind trying again.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.132
JAKE: Hey, go easy on me.

21:06.165 --> 21:09.101
You know I'm not 60 anymore.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.770
BEV: All right,
I'll be right back.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.472
I left the light on
in the living room.
