-How?

I don't know.

14:33.142 --> 14:35.210

woke up yesterday,

14:35.244 --> 14:38.380
looked at 50 kilos' worth of
cocaine hidden in a hot tub,

14:38.413 --> 14:40.850
remembered that Miami was just
on the cover of Time magazine

14:40.883 --> 14:42.785

telling anyone who will listen

14:42.818 --> 14:45.120

14:45.154 --> 14:46.989

for you.

14:49.191 --> 14:51.493

came to my country,

14:51.527 --> 14:54.496
organized us, trained us,
encouraged us to fight.

14:54.530 --> 14:57.733
And then one day, your Congress
just changed its mind.

14:57.767 --> 14:59.001
I understand that.

14:59.034 --> 15:01.236
Do you understand
that right now

15:01.270 --> 15:03.906
there are literally thousands
of soldiers in the jungle

15:03.939 --> 15:06.742
waiting for me to deliver
supplies and weapons?

15:06.776 --> 15:08.644
They are hungry and sick,

15:08.678 --> 15:11.113
and if I fail,
they will die.

15:14.784 --> 15:16.886
Do you honestly think that this
is the best way to help them?

15:16.919 --> 15:18.253
Yes.

15:18.287 --> 15:20.656
But I'm a soldier,
not a drug dealer.

15:20.690 --> 15:24.994
I can't run this operation
without the support of the CIA.

who can help me,
