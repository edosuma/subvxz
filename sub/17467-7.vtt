00:02.872 --> 00:04.439
Hi, I'm Jill.
I'm an alcoholic.

00:04.482 --> 00:06.223
ALL:
Hi, Jill.

00:06.267 --> 00:09.531
I got to tell you, if it wasn't
for this meeting tonight,

00:09.574 --> 00:11.228
I never would've gotten
out of bed today.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.795
Here we go.

00:12.838 --> 00:15.754
Fifty shades of Jill.

00:15.798 --> 00:19.236
Today's the anniversary
of my mother's suicide.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.847
Obviously, I misspoke.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.328
It's so weird

00:24.372 --> 00:26.417
'cause I remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:27.810 --> 00:30.160
I came home from school
a little early

00:30.204 --> 00:32.509
'cause cheerleading practice
was cut short.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.947
Shannon Benson misjudged
a scissor kick

00:34.991 --> 00:36.558
and broke her own nose...

00:37.994 --> 00:40.083
...which, believe me,
was a godsend.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.871
Anyway...

00:45.915 --> 00:48.613
I walked in the kitchen and
she gave me a real tight hug,

00:48.657 --> 00:52.226
which was odd because
she wasn't much of a hugger.

00:52.269 --> 00:55.142
And then she gave me
her credit card and told me

00:55.185 --> 00:57.144
to go to the mall and buy myself
something nice.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.757
And when I got back, I...

01:01.800 --> 01:04.629
I found her in the garage
slumped over the steering wheel

01:04.673 --> 01:07.067
with the motor running.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.288
I just stood there
in my new peach leather jacket,

01:11.332 --> 01:12.855
too scared to move.

01:15.075 --> 01:19.122
[choking up]:
You know what, this is too...

01:19.166 --> 01:20.515
I can't.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.082
Thank you.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.217
BRUCE: Would anyone else
like to share?

01:27.261 --> 01:29.741
I'll go.

01:30.829 --> 01:32.875
Hi, Bonnie, alcoholic.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.094
ALL:
Hi, Bonnie.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.313
[sighs]
What a day I've had.

01:36.357 --> 01:38.924
I waited around all morning

01:38.968 --> 01:40.100
for this package
to be delivered.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.666
I take two minutes to pee

01:41.710 --> 01:42.667
and miss the guy.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.408
Now, I got to go

01:44.452 --> 01:46.584
wait in line at the post office
forever.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.020
Ugh!

01:48.064 --> 01:49.587
I just want to kill myself.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.851
Oh, Mom!

01:52.895 --> 01:54.244
What?

01:58.292 --> 02:00.859
Well, you could've
given me a heads up.

02:02.209 --> 02:04.341
Sorry, I didn't know
the hand signal for,

02:04.385 --> 02:07.344
"Hey, idiot, Jill just talked
about her dead mother."

02:07.388 --> 02:09.607
You think she noticed?

02:09.651 --> 02:11.696
Yes, and do you know
why she noticed?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.263
Because she listens.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.352
The reason the program works
is you share your pain,

02:15.396 --> 02:18.007
other people listen and you feel
better 'cause you feel heard.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.530
You feel like you're not alone.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.881
Oh, my God, look,
a three-legged dog.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.840
He's got an apple.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.279
â™ª

02:46.253 --> 02:47.297
Are you okay, honey?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.604
I guess.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.867
Just... too sad to eat.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.739
Well, just know that
we're all here for you.

02:56.959 --> 02:59.222
You know, it's always
a hard day for me,

02:59.266 --> 03:01.181
but this year it's just
really kicking my ass.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.573
What do you think
that's about?

03:04.096 --> 03:07.404
My mother was 37
when she died.

03:07.448 --> 03:08.492
That's how old I am now.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.756
I've actually outlived her.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.802
Okay, this is serious.

03:13.845 --> 03:16.544
She told us her real age.

03:16.587 --> 03:20.243
She had so much--
a husband, a family,

03:20.287 --> 03:22.898
a career--
she still took her life.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.508
I mean, I don't have
any of that stuff.

03:24.552 --> 03:25.466
What am I doing?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.732
Who the hell puts mustard
on chicken salad?

03:32.734 --> 03:35.737
I know, I know, I should've
left her in the car.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.131
You know,
I-I think I'm gonna go.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.872
I'm just bringing
the group down.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.091
That's all right.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.527
I do that all the
time and I stay.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.096
Yeah, Jill, hang out.

03:47.139 --> 03:49.054
We can go catch a movie
or something.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.969
You guys are sweet.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.232
I appreciate it.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.407
Bye.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.409
See you.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.150
Okay, I don't know about you,

03:58.194 --> 03:59.195
but I'm a little worried.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.544
She's definitely
not herself.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.503
Yeah, it's time
to circle the wagons,

04:02.546 --> 04:04.679
make sure we're available
if she needs us.

04:04.722 --> 04:05.897
It just goes to show,

04:05.941 --> 04:07.247
you can have all
the money in the world

04:07.290 --> 04:08.639
and still be so unhappy.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.945
Very true.

04:09.988 --> 04:11.990
You know...

04:13.557 --> 04:15.429
...I spoke too soon.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.430
The mustard is working.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.307
[knocking]

04:25.439 --> 04:26.396
Hey, wake up.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.311
What? Is that your wife?

04:31.880 --> 04:33.447
There's someone at the door.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.796
Well, go answer it.

04:34.839 --> 04:36.101
No, this is when you

04:36.145 --> 04:37.451
being a giant comes in handy.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.065
[knocking continues]

04:43.108 --> 04:44.632
Who is it?

04:44.675 --> 04:45.763
It's Jill.

04:45.807 --> 04:46.764
[whispering]:
It's Jill.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.940
Thank you.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.595
I know we said
we'd be there for her,

04:51.639 --> 04:54.729
but I assumed it'd be
during business hours.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.339
Sorry to bother you,

04:56.383 --> 04:58.123
but I have some things
that I wanted to give you.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.474
Are you okay?Yeah, why you ask?

05:00.517 --> 05:02.127
It's after midnight.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.825
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot you guys

05:03.868 --> 05:05.609
have jobs and stuff.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.960
Here, this is for you.

05:11.963 --> 05:13.704
Oh, my God, this is a Rolex.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.098
What are you doing?

05:16.141 --> 05:17.665
Well, I have all these things,

05:17.708 --> 05:18.753
they don't make me happy,

05:18.796 --> 05:19.797
so I'm getting rid of them.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.364
Simplify, simplify, simplify.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.801
Or to simplify, just simplify.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.673
Okay, you're freaking me out.

05:25.716 --> 05:27.152
Mom, say something.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.676
That watch may be too
big for your wrist.

05:30.547 --> 05:32.549
I'm not taking this.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.072
Come on, let's have a cup of tea
and talk.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.422
I really don't have
time to talk, though,

05:35.465 --> 05:36.597
'cause I've got some
clothes and purses

05:36.640 --> 05:37.989
for Marjorie and Wendy.It can wait.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.251
You're not Santa Claus.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.383
You don't have to do
it all in one night.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.690
I like purses.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.564
Victor, I know we said
we'd go to the mall,

05:47.608 --> 05:49.436
but Jill's in crisis.

05:49.479 --> 05:52.047
Yes, they probably can
handle her without me,

05:52.090 --> 05:54.005
but I'd rather
they not know that.

05:55.267 --> 05:56.268
I got to go.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.837
Hi.

05:59.881 --> 06:02.231
Suddenly I feel underdressed.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.798
"Suddenly"?

06:05.626 --> 06:07.236
Where'd you get the tiara?

06:07.279 --> 06:08.498
Jill gave it to me.

06:08.542 --> 06:12.110
She was Miss Buttermilk Biscuit
1997.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.025
And you weren't.
Give it back.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.679
No. It was a gift

06:15.723 --> 06:17.420
from a dear and
possibly suicidal friend.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.595
It means a lot to me.

06:21.642 --> 06:22.686
Jill,

06:22.730 --> 06:24.384
time to wake up.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.429
Go away.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.604
It's 3:00.

06:27.648 --> 06:29.171
Don't you have things to do?

06:29.214 --> 06:32.261
The Pilates class, massage,

06:32.304 --> 06:35.003
something to wax?

06:35.046 --> 06:37.745
Those things all sound
so trivial now.

06:37.788 --> 06:40.617
They are,
that's why you love them.

06:40.661 --> 06:43.272
The Great Grey
Hope is here.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.667
[sighs]
I don't know what to do.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.582
She came over in the middle
of the night all wound up,

06:48.625 --> 06:50.279
then she crashed and
I can't get her out of bed.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.412
It's okay, I got it.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.285
Hey, sweetie.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.243
Hey, Marjorie.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.508
I understand
you're giving away

07:01.551 --> 07:02.726
all your stuff.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.381
I have a teapot for you
in my car.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.122
I don't want your
teapot, honey.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.906
Is it silver?

07:10.255 --> 07:11.909
Jill, giving away
all your stuff

07:11.953 --> 07:13.476
sounds like a
cry for help.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.609
It's just stuff.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.088
I'm still alone.

07:17.132 --> 07:18.481
You're not alone.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.048
Yes, I am!

07:20.091 --> 07:21.484
I mean, you have a husband

07:21.528 --> 07:22.572
and these two have each other.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.183
Real fun.
Lucky us.

07:25.227 --> 07:28.230
All I go home to
is my housekeeper,

07:28.273 --> 07:29.884
my gardener and my pool guy.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.233
Well, there you go.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.408
Be grateful for them.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.237
They hate me.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.241
Okay, you got your health,
you have your sobriety...

07:39.284 --> 07:41.809
A clean house with
a pool and a garden.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.420
Sounds to me like
somebody needs a meeting.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.553
Oh, why bother?

07:46.596 --> 07:48.598
My life is pointless.

07:48.642 --> 07:50.513
Okay, that's it.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.254
We're done.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.385
Hey!

07:53.429 --> 07:54.735
[sighs]
You just crossed the line

07:54.778 --> 07:56.388
from feeling your feelings

07:56.432 --> 07:57.999
to feeling sorry
for yourself.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.653
Get her.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.350
So, instead
of laying around here,

08:01.393 --> 08:02.699
wallowing in self-pity,

08:02.743 --> 08:03.831
you're gonna help someone

08:03.874 --> 08:05.310
less fortunate than you.

08:05.354 --> 08:08.531
I gave them a watch and a tiara.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.707
I volunteer
at a soup kitchen

08:10.751 --> 08:12.709
once a month.
You're coming with me.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.842
To a soup kitchen?

08:14.885 --> 08:16.670
That's a great idea.
I'll go, too.

08:16.713 --> 08:17.714
Mom?

08:17.758 --> 08:19.455
Sure, I could go for some soup.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.676
We're not having soup, are we?

08:27.028 --> 08:29.247
Hey, Charlotte,
you're looking good.

08:29.291 --> 08:30.727
Hey, Marjorie.

08:30.771 --> 08:33.251
This is Jill,
she's helping us out today.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.557
Nice to meet you.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.690
Did she get a nudge
from the judge?

08:36.732 --> 08:39.126
Nope, just volunteering.

08:39.169 --> 08:41.912
Oh, God bless you, sweetie.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.957
No, God bless you for,

08:44.001 --> 08:45.568
you know, being homeless.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.139
You were right.

08:51.182 --> 08:54.751
A tiara would have been
out of place here.

08:54.795 --> 08:57.319
It's out of place
everywhere.

08:57.362 --> 08:59.582
How long do we
have to do this?

08:59.626 --> 09:00.975
Oh, for God's sake,
it's been ten minutes.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.367
That's not an answer.

09:02.411 --> 09:04.108
Seriously?

09:04.152 --> 09:05.588
You're not getting
anything out of this?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.372
Zip.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.592
No gratitude,
nothing positive?

09:09.636 --> 09:12.116
Well, I wouldn't mind getting
the recipe for this cornbread.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.903
You can't really be
that self-obsessed.

09:15.946 --> 09:19.036
Hey, I'm here, I'm spooning out
this white stuff.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.081
It's mashed potatoes.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.561
Yeah, I beg to differ.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.042
Thank you, Marjorie.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.609
I'm glad we're doing this.

09:26.653 --> 09:27.958
I thought it might help.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.569
I didn't realize
how wonderful it is

09:29.612 --> 09:31.222
to feel needed.

09:31.266 --> 09:33.268
To take care of those who
can't take care of themselves.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.617
Well, you know, you
can come back here

09:34.661 --> 09:35.792
any time you want.

09:35.836 --> 09:36.880
They can always
use the help.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.186
Oh, no.
[chuckles]

09:38.229 --> 09:39.579
I'm never
coming back here.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.710
It's gross.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.932
But now I know what's
missing in my life.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.890
Well, that's terrific.

09:46.934 --> 09:47.978
You guys hear that?

09:48.022 --> 09:49.066
Jill's figured out

09:49.110 --> 09:50.372
what's missing in her life.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.721
Great, what is it?

09:51.765 --> 09:52.896
I need to have a baby.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.072
What?
A baby?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.465
Well, now I'm paying attention.

09:56.508 --> 09:57.814
Yeah, you know,
something that loves me

09:57.858 --> 09:59.816
and needs me
and isn't allowed to leave.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.905
Way to go, Marjorie.

10:08.216 --> 10:11.001
...which is when I said,
"Way to go, Marjorie."

10:11.045 --> 10:13.874
I was just trying to
give Jill perspective.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.223
And it was a good idea.

10:15.266 --> 10:17.442
That went horribly,
horribly wrong.

10:17.486 --> 10:20.271
So you guys all went
to a soup kitchen without me?

10:20.315 --> 10:23.013
Yeah, and it was full of
good-looking single guys.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.496
Don't get me wrong.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.541
I love her, but Jill is
the last person

10:29.585 --> 10:31.021
in the world who should be
having a baby.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.675
Normally, I'd agree with you,

10:32.719 --> 10:35.852
but I know a lot of women
with no maternal instincts

10:35.896 --> 10:37.985
who turned out to be
great mothers.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.726
BOTH:
Thank you.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.033
Did you even
think to call me?

10:45.166 --> 10:47.168
This isn't about
you, Wendy.

10:47.211 --> 10:50.345
Oh, hey, I finally got to
say it to somebody else.

10:50.388 --> 10:53.087
This isn't about you, Wendy.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.786
It's kind of fun.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.006
I don't think we have
to overreact here.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.964
I mean, we all
love Jill very much,

11:01.008 --> 11:02.139
but let's be honest,

11:02.183 --> 11:03.880
she has a short attention span.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.186
Today she wants a baby,

11:05.229 --> 11:07.144
tomorrow she'll
want a Birkin bag.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.711
She has a Birkin bag.

11:08.755 --> 11:12.236
Really? And all she gave
me was that stupid tiara?

11:12.280 --> 11:14.456
Wait, you guys got gifts?

11:19.896 --> 11:22.812
I can't believe she's already
picking out sperm donors.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.380
Well, she loves shopping,
it makes sense.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.383
So, what's the plan?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.298
I don't know,
figure out a way

11:30.341 --> 11:32.692
to talk her out of
this baby craziness.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.171
Great. What do you
need from me?

11:34.215 --> 11:35.303
Honestly?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.304
Go away for about an hour

11:36.347 --> 11:37.435
and come back with dinner.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.395
Excuse me, but I can help.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.266
I will tell her
how painful it was

11:42.310 --> 11:44.051
when you came out of me
feet first.

11:44.094 --> 11:47.141
I came out feet first
so I could run.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.494
Okay, so I've
got my donors

11:52.537 --> 11:54.278
separated into
three categories:

11:54.322 --> 11:56.106
brains, looks
and good hair.

11:56.150 --> 11:59.240
Wouldn't looks and good hair
be in the same category?

11:59.283 --> 12:00.807
Oh, Bonnie.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.246
Jill, maybe you should
think this through

12:05.289 --> 12:07.770
a little bit more before you
start picking a donor.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.294
Why would I want to wait when I
know this is what I want to do?

12:10.338 --> 12:11.774
Cheese and crackers!
Will you look at

12:11.818 --> 12:13.602
what they're
getting for sperm?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.647
Tell me about it.
In college,

12:15.691 --> 12:17.040
I was up to my eyeballs
in the stuff,

12:17.084 --> 12:19.303
now I got to write
a check for it.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.526
Hey, didn't you talk about
going to Europe next year?

12:24.569 --> 12:26.528
Gonna be mighty hard
with a baby.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.095
Oh, it's just a trip.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.749
I figured Europe's been there
for 300 years,

12:29.792 --> 12:32.273
it'll be there a few more.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.362
I'd move "brains"
to the front of the list.

12:34.405 --> 12:38.409
I was kind of leaning towards
this guy with the blue eyes.

12:38.453 --> 12:41.543
How pretty
would our daughter be?

12:42.544 --> 12:43.632
Lovely...

12:43.675 --> 12:46.766
in a master race
kind of way.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.637
What is this, Build-a-Bear?

12:48.680 --> 12:49.856
I mean, how do you even know

12:49.899 --> 12:51.161
it's gonna be a girl?

12:51.205 --> 12:52.554
[smacks lips]
Oh, it's easy,

12:52.597 --> 12:54.208
they just spin the goo up
in this thingie

12:54.251 --> 12:55.122
and you get what you want.

12:57.864 --> 13:00.040
Have you considered
the possibility

13:00.083 --> 13:02.956
that your alcoholism could be
passed down to this child?

13:02.999 --> 13:05.567
Oh, it won't be an issue.
My kid's not gonna drink

13:05.610 --> 13:09.571
and even if she does,
she'll go to the best rehabs.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.747
And we can go to meetings
together, like you two.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.099
Oh, honey, don't aim for us.

13:17.492 --> 13:20.495
To be honest, I really
am not sure that...

13:20.538 --> 13:21.975
Oh, I almost forgot!

13:22.018 --> 13:23.846
The doctor told me that
I was gonna need someone

13:23.890 --> 13:26.066
to give me hormone shots and go
with me to my appointments.

13:26.109 --> 13:28.155
You know, someone to be
my partner in all this.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.504
And I can't think
of anybody else

13:29.547 --> 13:31.158
I'd rather do this
with than you,

13:31.201 --> 13:33.029
'cause, well, you're
my best friend.

13:33.073 --> 13:33.943
Really?

13:35.336 --> 13:36.859
I'm your best friend?

13:36.903 --> 13:38.121
Of course you are.

13:38.165 --> 13:41.298
Wow, I don't know what to say.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.647
Thank you.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.258
So you'll do it?

13:44.301 --> 13:46.434
I'd be honored.

13:46.477 --> 13:47.696
Come here!

13:47.739 --> 13:48.871
[quietly]:
What are you doing?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.830
[quietly]:
No idea.

13:54.050 --> 13:57.619
Aw, they make cashmere onesies.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.142
"Cashmere"?

13:59.186 --> 14:01.318
You're gonna let your baby
spit up on cashmere?

14:01.362 --> 14:04.017
Well, I won't put her in it
when she's gonna spit up.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.718
Oh, okay, good plan.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.982
[gasps] A crib in the shape
of Cinderella's carriage.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.244
What do you think?

14:14.288 --> 14:16.333
It kind of looks
like a float

14:16.377 --> 14:18.596
in a very tiny
gay pride parade.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.774
That is going
on the baby registry.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.341
Jill, it's $18,000!

14:24.385 --> 14:26.213
No pressure, I'll have
a separate shower

14:26.256 --> 14:28.650
for my rich friends.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.609
Sweetie, you're not
even pregnant yet,

14:31.653 --> 14:33.873
you won't need any of
this stuff for a while.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.178
And when the baby
gets here,

14:35.222 --> 14:36.745
all it needs for
the first six months

14:36.788 --> 14:38.399
are clean diapers
and a boob.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.009
Oh, I am not breastfeeding.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.445
I googled some after pics,

14:41.489 --> 14:43.621
did not like what I saw.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.711
But breastfeeding is
good for the baby.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.757
Yeah, so is having a hot mom.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.676
Thanks again
for doing this with me.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.286
You're welcome.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.247
Once I'm a mom,
I know I'll be so happy.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.945
Jill Kendall.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.599
Okeydokey.

15:04.642 --> 15:07.950
Let's go see how many eggs
are in this basket.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.560
Jill, don't do this!

15:10.692 --> 15:11.954
Don't do what?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.477
Have a baby.

15:13.521 --> 15:14.870
It's not what you
think it is.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.480
It's not playing dress-up

15:16.524 --> 15:17.742
and picnics at the beach.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.701
I mean, there are
some picnics,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.485
but just packing up
the car to get there

15:21.529 --> 15:23.531
can crush your soul.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.967
And you will forget wipes.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.316
Trust me, you will forget them.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.537
Being a parent is hard.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.322
It's exhausting and you
are not cut out for it.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.803
Why are you saying this?

15:34.846 --> 15:36.979
You're supposed to be
my best friend.

15:37.023 --> 15:39.851
That's why I'm saying
it, because I am.

15:39.895 --> 15:42.028
You're trying to fix what
happened with your mom

15:42.071 --> 15:44.030
by having a baby and
it's not gonna work.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.730
If having a child solved
all our problems,

15:48.773 --> 15:50.688
your mother wouldn't have...

15:52.560 --> 15:53.909
done what she did.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.089
I never want
to talk to you again.

16:02.048 --> 16:04.137
Jill, I've been there.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.834
I know what I'm talking about.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.619
Just because you failed
as a mother doesn't mean I will!

16:14.408 --> 16:16.323
[door closes]

16:22.242 --> 16:24.244
Give her time.
I'm sure Jill will see

16:24.287 --> 16:26.028
you were coming
from a good place.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.638
I hope so.

16:27.682 --> 16:29.510
I really don't want to
lose her as a friend.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.903
When I got pregnant
with this one,

16:31.947 --> 16:34.167
I had a friend who didn't
think it was a good idea.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.299
I came this close to
having an abortion.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.083
What?!

16:38.214 --> 16:39.999
I told you this.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.043
Uh-uh.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.262
Would've remembered.

16:43.393 --> 16:46.353
Calm down, I didn't do it.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.094
Who?

16:48.137 --> 16:49.617
Who told you to get rid of me?

16:49.660 --> 16:51.227
Well, you don't know her,

16:51.271 --> 16:53.055
because I never
spoke to her again.

16:53.099 --> 16:56.667
That's my point, that might
happen between you and Jill.

16:56.711 --> 16:58.539
Wait, so in one breath,

16:58.582 --> 17:00.410
you just told me
that you almost aborted me

17:00.454 --> 17:02.456
and I may lose
one of my best friends forever.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.327
What kind of pep talk is that?

17:04.371 --> 17:06.895
Oh, my God, you get mad at me
when I pay attention,

17:06.938 --> 17:08.896
you get mad at me
when I don't pay attention.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.553
Well, well, well...

17:14.990 --> 17:17.079
Another private gathering.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.516
Don't be silly,
it's not private.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.476
Yeah, we just
forgot about you.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.608
Oh, okay then.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.958
So what's going on?
