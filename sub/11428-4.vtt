SUE AIKENS: I recently had
to leave camp,

00:17.000 --> 00:18.800
take care of some
personal business,

00:18.867 --> 00:21.100
and while I've been gone,
we had a phase two,

00:21.167 --> 00:22.733
phase three storm
blow through.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.400
The phase two-three
has a significant amount
of blowing snow,

00:27.467 --> 00:29.333
and where's
it gonna stack up on?

00:29.400 --> 00:31.200
My trailers, my runway.

00:31.267 --> 00:33.300
Snow will crush
a building if you let it.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.767
(PLANE ENGINE REVVING)

00:36.833 --> 00:39.200
And so I don't know how much
drifting there's been,

00:39.267 --> 00:41.767
I don't know if it's
compromised any
of the buildings.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.900
(OVER RADIO)
I'm kind of expecting
to see a bunch of drifting.

00:45.967 --> 00:49.000
I don't know
how much drifting,

00:49.067 --> 00:51.667
but if we can do any
kind of a onesie-twosie,

00:51.733 --> 00:54.000
it's gonna let me know
how much snow has built up.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.700
The buildings look intact.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.533
I can see some
pretty big tracks,

01:07.600 --> 01:10.133
you know, so I'll just
have to walk 'em.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.500
SUE: Normally when I land,
you want to get down,
get your gun,

01:13.567 --> 01:15.267
same thing every time.

01:15.367 --> 01:18.067
Go around and make sure
where are the paw prints,
what kind of animal.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.367
Is there something hiding
behind something?

01:20.433 --> 01:23.867
But, in the dead of winter,
with another storm
barrelling in on us soon,

01:23.933 --> 01:28.300
the first priority is
I need to have safe shelter
and warmth.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.667
That's camp.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.867
And, uh, flying in,
what I noticed,

01:34.933 --> 01:37.033
Kavik seems to have
dodged a bullet.

01:37.100 --> 01:40.900
But, um, I do see
some large prints.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:06.900 --> 02:09.533
This right here,
this is wolverine.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.233
And they're fairly fresh,
we just had a storm
go through.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.533
And he's a decent-sized
wolverine.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.500
Hi, Foxy.

02:20.633 --> 02:21.867
What up, little guy?

02:23.400 --> 02:24.633
Oh, wow.

02:26.333 --> 02:28.033
You're hurt.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.600
He's got blood on his back
and blood all down his
one side by his head.

02:32.233 --> 02:33.800
There is an animal around.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.233
It is a wolverine, I do have
at least one injured fox.

02:37.467 --> 02:39.633
And they're wild foxes,
they're not tame.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.233
And things eat
other things out here.

02:42.300 --> 02:45.233
And they're doing exactly
what they're supposed to do.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.167
They're not dependant on me.

02:47.233 --> 02:50.067
You think you're gonna
get a lollipop like
they do at the doctor's?

02:50.900 --> 02:53.867
Most important thing
is get my shelter,
get my heat going.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.800
I'll have my pistol
on my side.

02:55.867 --> 02:58.900
If something needs
to come through the wall to
get me, I'm prepared for it.

03:01.733 --> 03:04.500
When I left,
I turned the oil
off at the tank,

03:04.567 --> 03:07.533
so I've got to go
dig that out,
turn it back on.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.600
I've got to let that fuel flow
for a minute.

03:13.967 --> 03:16.400
The oil is now flowing,
hopefully, through the lines.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.067
Looks... Looks pretty good.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.467
I arrived,
I've got the heat going.

03:33.533 --> 03:35.300
I do have tracks
all over camp.

03:35.367 --> 03:39.067
It is a wolverine.
I do have at least
one injured fox.

03:39.633 --> 03:40.933
But right now, it's cold.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.133
I'm getting on darker time,
I got to hunker down.

JESSIE HOLMES: There's danger
around every bend out here,

03:49.133 --> 03:53.467

NARRATOR: For Jessie Holmes,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.533
rapidly dropping temperatures
are a sign that racing season
is about to begin.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.633
Proper training involves
hundreds of miles of running,

04:22.700 --> 04:25.833
and Jessie's first task
is to prepare his trails.

JESSIE: Constantly doing
routine maintenance on
my dogs' feet,

04:30.467 --> 04:33.567
so I know the ones
that do need the booties
and the ones that don't.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.767
While I'm out here working,

04:35.833 --> 04:40.467
while my concern might be
putting my physical work
into cutting the trail,

04:40.533 --> 04:43.667
I'm always...
Biggest concern is the dogs.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.700
Hike, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

I'm going five,
six, ten, I don't know
how many miles.

04:57.567 --> 05:01.300
Wherever the trail ends and
there needs to be trail cut,
that's where I'm headed to.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.767
So I haven't been
out here this time of year.
I don't know what to expect.

05:04.833 --> 05:08.167
Right now, we have 64 days
before our big race,

05:08.233 --> 05:12.400
so we've got
64 days to condition
these dogs out here.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.133
There we go.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.233
Now we're getting into
some tunnely portages here.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.000
Somebody's made it
through here

05:23.067 --> 05:26.267
but you can imagine
what it was like before
they punched through here,

05:26.367 --> 05:29.167
and that's what I'm gonna
be dealing with
as we get further on.

05:29.267 --> 05:30.900
Whoa, whoa.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.300
All right.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.867
I love to hear the dogs
barking and screaming
and howling.

05:36.933 --> 05:39.000
That means they're
ready to go,
they're feeling good.

05:39.067 --> 05:40.667
I build on that attitude.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.933
This is why I do this.
This is what I live for.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.133
I live for the sound of the
dog sled going across.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.100
It's very quiet,
it's not like a snow machine,

05:48.167 --> 05:49.633
it doesn't smell
like a machine,

05:49.700 --> 05:51.000
or doesn't make loud noise.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.733

-Whoa, whoa.

06:01.833 --> 06:03.500
to cut their way through
to get through here.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.167
These were laid
over the trail.

06:05.233 --> 06:08.200

be encountering
as soon as I get out further.

heading home.
It's getting dark.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.000

a good run though,

06:14.067 --> 06:15.800
so that's... That's great.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.933

out here in a new spot.

happy to be doing
what they're doing.

to do ahead of me.

further tomorrow

06:26.333 --> 06:29.500

and putting my part into
getting the trail out.

Life improves as you
get older and wiser.

06:34.633 --> 06:36.233
Don't make the same mistakes.

06:46.867 --> 06:49.900
Ah, it's a little stormy,
but we'll get some willows.

06:49.967 --> 06:52.033
We'll just pick out long,
slender ones.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.633
The game plan is I'm going
to show my daughter
how to go get willows

06:54.700 --> 06:57.000
so we can put some snares
in the willows for rabbits.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.767
The only way you can really
get them is by snaring,

06:58.833 --> 07:00.867
and, uh, you know,
this is what we do
at this time of year.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.400
When you grab 'em,
you bend 'em over,
and you saw on 'em

07:03.800 --> 07:06.300
as you're bending 'em.
And then they'll just
snap off, okay?

07:06.367 --> 07:08.200
And you have to
watch your eyes
in the willows, too.

07:08.267 --> 07:09.500
You can poke an eye out.

NARRATOR: For Chip
and Agnes Hailstone,

07:11.833 --> 07:15.367
passing down native hunting
techniques to their daughters
is a vital tradition.

07:15.433 --> 07:17.500
With an increase
in rabbit population,

07:17.567 --> 07:19.500
Chip will teach Carol
to build and set snares

07:19.567 --> 07:21.300
to harvest the animals
for meat.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.533
Oops. Sorry, Dad!

07:28.600 --> 07:30.400
I'm okay, I just got
whacked in the eye.

07:30.467 --> 07:33.667
What I'm looking for
right now is basically
the piece of wood.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.500
So as long as I've got enough
of these...

07:37.033 --> 07:38.600
That's what I'm looking for.

07:38.867 --> 07:40.867
The willows are the kind of
material we're looking for.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.267
They're short,
they're easy to get.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.367
When we put the
rabbit snares out,

07:44.433 --> 07:47.333
the rabbit snares will be in
the willows, so they'll look
like just any other willow.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.100
And when the rabbit gets it,
and it's trying to move
off somewhere

07:51.167 --> 07:53.600
and the noose is tightening
on it, it won't break.

(CHIP SPEAKING)

07:58.100 --> 07:59.200
(CAROL SPEAKING)

08:01.833 --> 08:03.267
CHIP: I want my daughter
to learn that there's both,

08:03.333 --> 08:05.000
the materials
that she needs down here

08:05.067 --> 08:06.933
and the animals
that she's looking for.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.867
So that ought to work out
pretty well.

08:08.933 --> 08:11.067
And, uh, you know,
she just needs to learn
these little things,

08:11.133 --> 08:12.667
then she can go off
and do her own.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.600
I want her to learn this
and I want her to
have independence,

08:16.667 --> 08:18.500
and I want her to be
self-motivated,

08:18.567 --> 08:21.300
and I want her to be able
to go down here at any time
that she needs to

08:21.367 --> 08:23.700
and use the materials
for the animals that
are available.

08:27.167 --> 08:29.400
Ugh, getting slapped in
the face with willows.

08:29.467 --> 08:30.467
I think we've got enough.

08:30.533 --> 08:31.767
What's next with these?

08:31.833 --> 08:33.267
We're gonna take 'em to
the house and trim 'em up.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.567
I'll probably take 'em
inside the house

08:34.633 --> 08:36.333
'cause it's getting dark
and it's pretty nasty,

08:36.400 --> 08:39.333
and we've got to
pare these things down
to get rid of the branches

08:39.400 --> 08:42.533
and get rid of the extra parts
and make 'em a uniform size
and then mark 'em.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.500
So when all this big
snowstorm stops,

08:47.567 --> 08:50.133
what we've got to do
is let the snow settle
for probably a day,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.500
and the snow will compact
from its fluffiness,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.400
and the rabbits will go
and make a track,

08:54.467 --> 08:55.600
and then where
they make tracks,

08:55.700 --> 08:57.267
they'll always try to follow
their same trails

08:57.333 --> 08:58.400
'cause they'll beat
their trails down.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.167
Once they've done that, we'll
know where to put the snares.

09:01.867 --> 09:03.133
Look at this, babe.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.700
This is what I do.

09:04.767 --> 09:09.233
I go around it twice.
One time, and then two times.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.133
I slip it through like that,

09:11.200 --> 09:12.600
and that way
it'll never come off,

09:12.667 --> 09:14.767
but if I want to recycle it,
use it again,

09:15.200 --> 09:16.500
and, you know,
I'm done snaring,

09:16.567 --> 09:17.733
I just come
and take the snare off

09:17.800 --> 09:19.000
so I don't carry
the stick home.

09:19.567 --> 09:21.100
Something like that,

09:21.167 --> 09:23.067
and then put it high
enough to where
their feet don't go into it.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.200
It won't loosen up,
it'll stay there.

09:25.267 --> 09:28.100
And the more they struggle,
the quicker they die.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.800
But what we'll do is,
we'll just take
the snow machine.

09:29.867 --> 09:33.333
Where we find
the most rabbit tracks
is where we'll set the snares.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.033
And 35 is a good start.

09:40.033 --> 09:42.767
GLENN VILLENEUVE:
If you just walked out here
not knowing what you're doing

09:42.833 --> 09:44.033
and you didn't
prepare yourself,

09:44.100 --> 09:45.667
it would be very dangerous.

09:58.867 --> 10:02.133
This time of year,
the ice is growing,
it makes a lot of noise.

10:02.433 --> 10:04.200
Especially when it
doesn't have snow on it yet.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.400
I'm really excited
to see the lake like this.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.400
It's all frozen across,

10:08.467 --> 10:10.800
but there's no snow
on top of the ice yet.

10:11.067 --> 10:12.233
This is an unusual condition.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.667
It doesn't happen like this
every year.

10:13.733 --> 10:16.200
Some years, it's snowing right
when the lake freezes.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.933
With this ice like this,
I can walk around
the edge of the lake,

10:19.033 --> 10:21.433
and I can find a plant
that grows in the water,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.600
and I can eat this plant
during the wintertime.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.933
The Eskimos call it
"goosegrass."

10:26.167 --> 10:29.067
Goosegrass is a plant I can
get to even in the winter
if the conditions are right,

10:29.133 --> 10:31.767
and right now, the conditions
are just right to get it.

10:31.833 --> 10:33.867
And what I'm hoping
is I can find

10:33.933 --> 10:36.033
where it got frozen
right into the ice

10:36.100 --> 10:38.033
and where it's sticking up
above the ice.

10:38.100 --> 10:42.067
Then I can cut it off,
put it in my bucket,
and take that plant to eat.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.400
I like to eat a lot of meat,
I like to eat a lot of fat,

10:44.467 --> 10:46.367
but it's important to have
some plant food to go with it,

10:46.433 --> 10:48.200
because you need the fibre.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.967
I can walk all the way
around this lake,

10:51.033 --> 10:52.600
look in the shallows where
this plant grows

10:52.667 --> 10:54.600
and hopefully find
some goosegrass to
bring home tonight.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.833
(LOW RUMBLING)

10:56.900 --> 10:58.233
Listen to that ice.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.867
(LOW RUMBLING)

11:05.000 --> 11:06.433
Aren't those sounds amazing?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.367
It's still pretty thin.

11:10.433 --> 11:12.433
I'm going to have to be
careful walking around on it.

11:12.767 --> 11:16.767
When the ice
first freezes like this,
and there's no snow on it,

11:16.833 --> 11:18.167
it makes a great
place to walk.

11:18.533 --> 11:20.833
It's so smooth
and easy to travel on.

11:20.900 --> 11:22.200
But I got to be careful,

11:22.667 --> 11:24.700
'cause there's still
places where there
isn't even ice yet.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.867
Look at that,
open water right there.

11:27.267 --> 11:29.833
But it's important
to go now because
if I wait, it could snow.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.800
If it snows tonight,
I won't be able to get
this plant tomorrow.

11:32.867 --> 11:34.500
It's like being
in an aquarium here.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.067
I can just look down
through the ice

11:36.133 --> 11:38.167
and see what's going on
in the water.

11:38.467 --> 11:41.800
I learn more about the
lake walking on this ice
in just a day

11:41.900 --> 11:44.633
than I do in weeks
paddling around in a canoe.

11:44.833 --> 11:48.067
It's important to go out
and look for things,
even if it doesn't work out,

11:48.133 --> 11:50.467
because every time
I'm out walking around,

11:50.533 --> 11:52.600
I'm learning
more about the area.

11:52.667 --> 11:55.100
I'm getting in touch
with what's going on
right at this time.

11:55.767 --> 11:57.700
The fact of the matter
is it's different every year,

11:57.767 --> 12:00.033
and you never know,
unless you go and look,
what you're gonna find.

12:07.467 --> 12:08.467
Hey.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.233
Look at this.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.767
That's a bear track.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.367
That's a grizzly bear.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.533
He was walking
right here along
the edge of the ice.

12:16.767 --> 12:18.067
It's a nice-sized bear.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.867
I'm not the only one
out here looking
for food today.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.200
Right in this area here,

12:30.267 --> 12:31.933
this was all full
of goosegrass

12:32.000 --> 12:33.400
growing up through the water
in the summer.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.267
Here are a couple
pieces right here,

12:35.333 --> 12:38.267
but most of it,
it's underneath the ice.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.967
Unusual weather this year.

12:40.033 --> 12:41.433
It snowed really early

12:41.500 --> 12:43.000
and I think that snow
and cold weather

12:43.067 --> 12:44.300
just knocked
the goosegrass down

12:44.367 --> 12:46.000
before the lake had
a chance to freeze.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.300
(LOW RUMBLE)

12:47.433 --> 12:49.600
Hey, something just
walked through the woods.

12:50.033 --> 12:51.233
I don't know
exactly what it was,

12:51.300 --> 12:52.967
but I'm gonna go up
and check it out.

12:55.867 --> 12:58.800
So I was down on
the lake, walking along,
looking for the goosegrass,

12:58.867 --> 13:01.167
and I just caught a glimpse
of something in the trees
up here.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.933
I ran up, and look at this.
A wolverine. It just came by.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.967
Look at this track,
it's perfect.

13:07.933 --> 13:11.200
You can even see the
claw marks at the end
of the toes here.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.633
There's a wolverine
right around here.

13:14.033 --> 13:17.033
He heard me when
I started walking up here
and he took off.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.700
Something's going on
around here.

13:19.767 --> 13:21.933
NARRATOR: Glenn is
searching for goosegrass,

13:22.367 --> 13:25.100
a source of fibre he can
harvest this time of year.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.933
But a sudden movement
in the trees

13:27.000 --> 13:28.633
forces him to investigate.

13:29.100 --> 13:33.633
Any opportunity for meat in
the scarce Brooks Range
cannot be taken for granted.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.733
GLENN: There's a
moose track here.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.733
There's a wolverine
following this moose track

13:37.800 --> 13:41.833
and I think I caught a glimpse
of a wolf through the trees,
but I can't be sure.

13:41.900 --> 13:46.233
If there's a wolverine around,
a lot of times it's a sign
that something's been killed.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.567
Wolverines are scavengers,

13:47.633 --> 13:49.467
and there's a wolverine
running around here,

13:49.533 --> 13:52.000
and that's a sign that there
might be something killed
around here.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.700
There could even be caribou.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.700
I'm gonna get
back home now.
It's getting late.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.600
You can be out
looking for goosegrass,

13:59.667 --> 14:01.900
you can have a wolverine
right behind you
walking around in the woods.

14:02.233 --> 14:03.700
It's what keeps life
interesting out here.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.233
All the animals around,
different things that happen.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.200
It's not like going
to the supermarket
for your groceries.

14:09.267 --> 14:10.967
That's why I live out here.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.700
You never want to put
all your eggs in one basket.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.200
You can't count
on any one resource.

14:15.267 --> 14:16.900
That's why I have
other alternatives.

14:16.967 --> 14:19.767
I didn't get the goosegrass,
but I'll find something else
to eat.

14:24.033 --> 14:27.833
SUE: You don't know when
something unique is gonna
happen out here,

14:27.900 --> 14:29.433
but you better
be on your toes.

14:36.467 --> 14:37.867
There he is.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.967
He's on top of my ridge now.

14:41.033 --> 14:42.933
NARRATOR: After a brief stay
in Deadhorse,

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
Sue has returned home
to find a wolverine lurking
around Kavik's perimeter.

14:47.067 --> 14:50.933
To protect herself,
securing camp is a priority.

14:51.067 --> 14:54.900
Came in last night,
got as much done as I could,

14:54.967 --> 14:56.700
noted the wolverine tracks.

14:56.767 --> 14:58.733
And they're...
It's a decent-sized wolverine.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.933
Saw my little Foxy
bloodied up.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.033
Got up here to look around
just to make sure
there's no wolf,

15:04.100 --> 15:07.567
there's no anything
directly in my path to go
from here to the shop,

15:07.633 --> 15:08.933
and boom.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.067
Way out here
about a mile and a half,

15:11.133 --> 15:12.967
is, uh, the big wolverine.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.767
Is that a threat? Absolutely.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.800
They are a force
to be reckoned with.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.667
And they will take on
a 800-pound grizzly and win.

15:20.867 --> 15:22.100
You know, and it's just
one of those things.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.733
I've got to make
a committed choice.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.867
Do I go after the wolverine?

15:26.933 --> 15:28.833
Or do I continue on my chores?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.233
If he comes closer in,
then I gotta...

15:31.300 --> 15:33.833
There's no choice,
I gotta go take care of it.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.467
I have to get
my electric started.

15:36.533 --> 15:39.967
I have to check the integrity
of camp out.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.500
I just don't trust
that furry little fucker.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.233
I'm gonna go
down the rows,

15:48.300 --> 15:51.300
and see what tracks are there.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.867
How fresh are they?
Where are they headed?

15:54.233 --> 15:55.900
Make sure that
that little joker

15:55.967 --> 15:57.767
doesn't have a cubby
he's cubbying up in.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.100
This little dude has got
a taste of blood in camp.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.133
I know he hurt Slinky.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.000
I don't want to be
his next meal.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.467
This over here,

16:07.733 --> 16:11.233
little tiny roundish prints.
Look at the spacing.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.600
This is a fox.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.300
This has got some snow in it,

16:15.367 --> 16:17.633
but check out
the size difference, right?

16:18.033 --> 16:20.533
Let me get my hand
down there. Boom.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.633
That is a wolverine track.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.533
You cannot be
too careful here.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.700
The minute
you let your guard down,

16:27.767 --> 16:29.533
just put a little
ketchup on yourself

16:29.600 --> 16:30.800
and call yourself a pork chop.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.467
You're gonna get it.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.667
Again, wolverine, wolverine.

16:36.567 --> 16:38.000
The fuck?

16:41.100 --> 16:44.233
Tell me the wolverine
is not decked out

16:45.467 --> 16:48.000
in a little hole by my camp.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.633
This is my camp, not his.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.367
He sees it
the other way around.

16:51.433 --> 16:54.033
So, what's the most imperative
thing that I can do today?

16:54.300 --> 16:57.333
Get my electrics on, get
those spotlights on in camp.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.800
The predators tend
to stay out of range
of the spotlights.

17:01.800 --> 17:06.300
I'm hoping that he just says,
"Shit, Sue's back, damn it."
And he goes away.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.800
But if he doesn't,
I will defend this camp

17:08.867 --> 17:10.733
with every piece of armament
that I've got.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.567
I will defend my foxies
with every piece of
armament that I've got.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.033
This is my camp.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.367
JESSIE: No matter how much
I know or how much
I try to be safe,

17:22.433 --> 17:24.667
it still can all go wrong
for me out there
at some point.

17:25.267 --> 17:26.567
(DOGS BARKING)

17:27.133 --> 17:29.833
Gee, gee, gee.
Straight ahead,
straight ahead.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.900
I'm just trying
to get 'em settled
into a rhythm

17:36.967 --> 17:41.300
and travel to the end
of the broke-out trail
and start cutting some trail.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.500
I've got my chainsaw here,
my bow saw.

17:44.200 --> 17:47.467
All the stuff I need
for a good day of
working on the trail here.

17:47.533 --> 17:50.067
NARRATOR: After scouting
favourable mushing conditions,

17:50.500 --> 17:53.433
Jessie and his dog team
will trek deeper
into the wilderness

17:53.500 --> 17:57.067
and break more trail
in order to train for the
coming racing season.

17:57.733 --> 17:59.333
JESSIE:
Once you head out here,

17:59.400 --> 18:01.333
you're just heading
further and further away
from civilisation,

18:01.400 --> 18:03.100
and that's
a good feeling to me.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.833
I didn't move out here
to live in a town,

18:06.233 --> 18:08.733
I moved out here
to just have access to this.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.933
Good dogs.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.500
Stay.

18:26.033 --> 18:28.000
Well, it looks
like there's some
tracks up here.

18:28.067 --> 18:30.233
Yeah, here's these
tracks right here
going this way.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.667
We're out in wolf country now,

18:31.733 --> 18:33.633
and that's the
pleasure of getting
out further

18:33.700 --> 18:35.633
is that you start getting out
into the real wilderness

18:35.700 --> 18:37.333
and start seeing things.

18:37.400 --> 18:39.100
This guy was through
here last night,

18:39.167 --> 18:40.600
but he's coming back.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.533
This track's about
the size of my hand,
so he's a big ol' boy.

18:46.367 --> 18:50.000
I'm getting' pretty close
into the area where I got
chased by wolves.

18:50.100 --> 18:54.733
I was coming home
from a 60-mile training run

18:54.800 --> 18:58.500
and come out onto
one of these lakes
at about 1:00 in the morning,

18:58.567 --> 19:01.233
full moon night,
right into a pack of wolves.

19:02.067 --> 19:04.833
Chased me for two miles,
charged me.

19:04.933 --> 19:09.067
I used to never carry
a handgun out here.
I didn't have a handgun.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.400
Now I always come out here
prepared with a firearm.

19:13.467 --> 19:14.667
-All right, guys.
-(DOGS BARKING)

19:15.867 --> 19:16.900
All right.

19:19.467 --> 19:21.733
This is it,
the first dog team,

19:21.800 --> 19:23.433
first person
out here this year,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.200
so we got our work
ahead of us.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.133
Straight ahead, boys.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.500
Oh, whoa, boys.
Good boys, stay.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.400
Hey, whoa, we're gonna
stop here for a while.

19:35.767 --> 19:37.300
This is where
my work will start.

19:37.367 --> 19:38.833
I got to get
this stuff cut out,

19:38.900 --> 19:40.367
so it's time
to get to work now.

19:40.867 --> 19:43.567
This is it. This is what
I come out here for

19:43.633 --> 19:46.500
is to mush trail, but at least
you know, I'm feeling good

19:46.567 --> 19:49.733
because the dogs
already ran 16 miles,
with six dogs.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.333
That's amazing, man.
These guys are in great shape.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.833
I just got to put
good day's work in.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.900
Plug in some more trail.

19:57.567 --> 20:00.300
Might be able to bring
more dogs out here
tomorrow than six.

-(CHAINSAW BUZZING)
-Stay, stay! Whoa, whoa!

20:09.133 --> 20:10.333
Whoa!

20:12.367 --> 20:13.700
Fuck are you guys doing?

20:13.767 --> 20:15.067
These dogs will
get away from you

20:15.133 --> 20:17.533
and they will not come back.
They will keep going.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.233
Stay up!

20:19.300 --> 20:20.967
Stay.

20:21.033 --> 20:22.700
Sometimes,
they go without you,
and that's not good.

20:23.200 --> 20:27.267
Just pushed through
about 150 yards to
this portage here.

20:27.433 --> 20:29.900
These are the trail
passages that go
through here,

20:29.967 --> 20:31.633
this is an old trail,

20:31.700 --> 20:34.300
but every year it takes
work and maintenance
to get through here,

20:34.367 --> 20:35.933
and stuff falls in the trail.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.033
I just got to make it
through this section
of woods here

20:39.133 --> 20:41.733
and then it's gonna be
open and then the dogs
are gonna do the work

20:41.800 --> 20:44.400
and put the trail in
to the next portage,

20:44.467 --> 20:47.367
and I'll continue
to cut my way
all the way to Old Minto.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.500
This is the kind of stuff
we have to do all winter
to use these trails.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.833
They don't just
maintain themselves.

20:52.900 --> 20:58.133
They take elbow grease
and chainsaw power
to get through here.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.500
All right, that's one trail,
and now it's off to see
what lies ahead of us.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.733
This thing's got to go.

21:10.800 --> 21:15.033
Be coming through here in the
middle of the night and bam,
knock yourself in the head.

21:15.100 --> 21:19.033
Not something you want
to have happen out here
when it's 30, 40 below zero.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.100
(CHAINSAW BUZZING)

21:26.033 --> 21:30.433
Put this work in now
and you can use this trail,
you know, safely.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.833
That's the thing.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.467
Feeling good though,
making good time.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.333
Are you boys ready?

21:37.867 --> 21:40.400
Straight ahead, gentlemen.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.633
I had no intention
of going this far today.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.733
I thought I'd just
be cutting brush,

21:44.800 --> 21:46.833
but I'm gonna make
a straight run back

21:46.900 --> 21:49.133
and be back out here tomorrow
with the new team.

21:51.300 --> 21:53.100
CHIP: It's not only
using the materials.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.767
It's knowing when to be there,
what you're targeting,
and how to get it.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.267
Carol's inside getting
herself ready

22:04.333 --> 22:05.700
and I'm getting
the machine ready.

22:05.767 --> 22:06.900
I'm gonna throw my sled on.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.200
I'm heading
down to the willows.

22:08.267 --> 22:09.533
That's where the rabbits live.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.200
We're gonna go
put some snares out.

22:15.700 --> 22:18.233
I'm gonna put the sled
on and we can take them
with the sled.

22:18.367 --> 22:21.067
Throw the willows on here,
those snares that got set up.

22:21.233 --> 22:23.700
We're just going down here,
down along the edge
of the river.

22:23.867 --> 22:25.233
AGNES: Have fun!

22:28.667 --> 22:30.367
NARRATOR:
After fashioning their snares,

22:30.433 --> 22:33.000
Chip and Carol head out
to set a two-mile trap line

22:33.067 --> 22:35.867
to harvest rabbits
for vital meat and protein.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.100
We're trying to get
these little...

22:46.167 --> 22:47.467
Little snowshoe hares
right here.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.667
Around here, they
call these "ukulaitchiaq",

22:49.733 --> 22:51.233
which are small rabbits.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.333
We're just gonna keep going
down along the trail here,

22:53.400 --> 22:54.833
and wherever we see
where they're crossing,

22:54.900 --> 22:56.300
we'll probably put a snare
on either side.

22:56.633 --> 22:59.167
Finding where the rabbits
have got a trail,

22:59.233 --> 23:02.600
they tend to go reuse
the same trails
again and again.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.633
So we find that trail,
we put a snare,

23:04.700 --> 23:08.233
we put a couple little guide
sticks to make sure that it
hits the snare the right way,

23:08.300 --> 23:11.800
put the snare a certain amount
off the ground,

23:11.867 --> 23:13.000
and let 'er rip.

23:13.067 --> 23:14.067
We'll see what happens.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.600
You might make that
just a little bit lower.

23:17.633 --> 23:19.700
CAROL: Like that?

23:19.767 --> 23:21.000
CHIP: Yep, just like that.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.933
The snare has to be
high enough above the snow

23:23.000 --> 23:25.433
that the rabbit's feet
doesn't get into it,
and its head does.

23:36.233 --> 23:38.600
This is what we do
at this time of year
when the river's freezing up.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.100
It doesn't matter
if it's freezing up in October
or November or December,

23:42.167 --> 23:43.800
it's the time of year
to set snares and traps.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.100
We got a lot of darkness.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.700
The traps hunt while we sleep.

23:46.767 --> 23:48.233
This is what we do when
there's rabbits around

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
and now there's
rabbits around.

23:49.967 --> 23:51.467
Let's see what comes of it.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.667
SUE: Progress happens.

23:55.733 --> 23:57.767
Just 'cause I stand still,
the rest of the world doesn't.

24:05.267 --> 24:07.967
What I need to do today
is get power to camp.

24:08.033 --> 24:09.700
I have to get those lights on.

24:09.767 --> 24:11.300
NARRATOR: With
a wolverine nearby,

24:11.367 --> 24:14.433
it is critical for Sue
to restore Kavik's power,

24:14.500 --> 24:17.767
as the lights will
aid in keeping predators
from her doorstep.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.767
But before she can reach
the generator,

24:19.833 --> 24:22.533
she must be sure that
her shed is free of danger.

24:23.033 --> 24:25.733
SUE: I did put on the .44.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.933
I've got to have some
form of protection.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.967
I mean, I see
the wolverine out this way.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.467
He's still about a mile out.

24:31.533 --> 24:33.467
So I'm gonna try
to get my chores done.

24:33.533 --> 24:36.733
But that doesn't mean
there's not something else
in the sheds.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.367
Sometimes the predators
work where you're
paying attention to this,

24:40.433 --> 24:41.733
and not to what's right here.

24:43.433 --> 24:45.733
This is the back
entrance to the gen shed.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.500
And I am just looking.

24:57.967 --> 25:01.500
I mean, it looks pretty good.
What I'm really looking for

25:01.567 --> 25:04.300
is it should be dark. (LAUGHS)

25:04.367 --> 25:07.533
If I can see any light
down in the end there
from either side,

25:07.600 --> 25:09.567
that means the building's
been compromised.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.233
And I don't see anything.

25:23.300 --> 25:25.833
Using my ears,
I don't hear an animal.

25:30.533 --> 25:35.233
One of the last steps
for clearing camp.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.400
There is the generator
in question.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.933
(EXHALES) Good.

25:40.367 --> 25:43.033
I'm really concerned
with some of this stuff.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.267
It was not black
and shitty like that before.

25:46.833 --> 25:48.233
See the oil?

25:50.367 --> 25:51.733

26:14.767 --> 26:16.933
Fuck you. (SIGHS)

26:18.100 --> 26:19.800
It is starving for fuel.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.100
Why are you starving for fuel?

26:22.467 --> 26:26.433
This is the fuel line
going in,

26:26.533 --> 26:28.167
and this is my return line.

26:28.433 --> 26:30.033
And I should be
seeing fuel right now.

26:30.100 --> 26:31.533
This is not looking too good.

26:32.733 --> 26:34.133
And that's dry as a bone.

26:34.467 --> 26:38.467
What I need to do
is follow my line...

26:38.533 --> 26:39.567
Yeah, right here.

26:39.633 --> 26:42.467
And this shut-off valve
is frozen solid.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.767
What that tells me
is there's water in here.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.100
It couldn't get
the fuel to come out.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.700
Now I know why
it couldn't go down the line.

26:52.767 --> 26:53.800
It couldn't get
through the line.

26:55.533 --> 26:57.367
I'm going to have
to tear it all apart,

26:58.233 --> 27:02.467
and I guarantee you
that once I heat those up,
all those metal fittings,

27:02.533 --> 27:06.467
probably gonna see that
they're cracked and leaking.

27:08.367 --> 27:09.567
This is done.

27:10.033 --> 27:12.567
I am at a dead standstill.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.167
Argh!

27:14.900 --> 27:16.400
I'm having problems.

27:18.933 --> 27:20.433
GLENN: I was looking
all over the world

27:20.500 --> 27:22.433
for a place to kind of
live close to nature
like this,

27:22.500 --> 27:23.933
and I ended up up here.

27:25.067 --> 27:27.800
I think today I'm just going
to stay home and do some
work around the cabin.

27:27.867 --> 27:29.333
I've got a few jobs
I can work on.

27:30.533 --> 27:34.133
This is my sled, and it's in
need of some repair.

27:34.433 --> 27:36.433
It's on its third winter.

27:36.900 --> 27:39.200
It's starting to develop
some cracks,

27:39.267 --> 27:42.100
and these cracks
are very significant

27:42.167 --> 27:44.600
because if I don't do
something about it,

27:44.667 --> 27:47.733
that crack's gonna
continue right across
the sled and it'll break.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.300
And I've got to fix this
in the back where
the plastic's bending under.

27:52.133 --> 27:54.200
That's just causing
way too much drag in the snow,

27:54.267 --> 27:57.367
and it's just gonna
tear worse and worse
if I don't fix it now.

27:57.633 --> 27:59.100
NARRATOR: In winter,

27:59.167 --> 28:01.900
Glenn must constantly
maintain his camp
and equipment.

28:02.100 --> 28:05.933
But 200 miles
from the nearest town,
and without any machinery,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.567
Glenn uses only
the tools at his disposal
to survive in isolation.

28:10.867 --> 28:13.167
I'm gonna have to
soften it up with heat.

28:13.233 --> 28:14.733
Hopefully, then I'll be
able to bend it down.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.333
Oh, yeah.

28:17.567 --> 28:19.267
I can feel that heat now.

28:19.333 --> 28:22.200
If I bend that
when it's real cold,

28:22.267 --> 28:23.700
I'm afraid it might crack.

28:24.733 --> 28:26.667
So I just want to heat it up.

28:27.467 --> 28:29.100
Now that it's softened up
with that heat,

28:29.167 --> 28:30.967
I'm able to bend the plastic.

28:31.533 --> 28:34.633
Oh, look at that.
It bends easy.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.100
When that cools, it'll stay
right where I want it.

28:37.533 --> 28:38.833
Get that straightened
right out.

28:39.200 --> 28:43.100
That was all deformed,
probably from a stick
on a piece of firewood,

28:43.167 --> 28:45.133
and it wasn't
gonna straighten out

28:45.200 --> 28:49.067
without heating it
once it was deformed
that badly.

28:49.133 --> 28:51.633
All right, I got that
bent back into shape.
(BLOWS)

28:51.700 --> 28:53.100
Don't need
any more heat on it.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.867
Anywhere there's a crack,

28:55.933 --> 28:58.233
I need to put a hole
right at the very end of it.

28:58.300 --> 28:59.867
That'll stop it
from spreading.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.700
I don't really own
that many things,

29:01.767 --> 29:04.300
but the things I own
are essential to me
living out here.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.333
When things break down,
I have to fix 'em.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.067
Out here, I got to be
a jack-of-all-trades.

29:08.133 --> 29:11.133
I have to be able to fix
everything that I have,
keep it going.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.067
If it's essential equipment
and I don't maintain it,

29:14.567 --> 29:16.167
then I'll have a real problem.

29:21.167 --> 29:24.167
Got the sled all fixed up,
I'm gonna go grab some
firewood with it.

29:25.833 --> 29:27.933
A sled is an essential piece
of equipment for me.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.700
This is one of my most
important basic tools,
like my rifle, my knife.

29:32.767 --> 29:35.333
It's the way I move
heavy things around
all winter long.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.867
Without a sled,
I'd have a hell of a hard time
just getting my firewood home,

29:39.233 --> 29:42.333
getting meat home
when I kill the animals
far away from camp.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.167
This is transportation for me.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.167
All through the winter,
I'm cutting firewood.

29:46.233 --> 29:48.667
A lot of times,
I'll cut more than I can
haul home that night,

29:48.733 --> 29:50.700
and I leave it
and come back later
and pick it up.

29:51.033 --> 29:54.100
Sometimes now I'm going
300-400 yards to get firewood.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.867
It makes all the difference
having a sled
to bring it home with.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.033
Sled is sliding great.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.067
I got the plastic bent
back up so it's not
dragging in the snow.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.600
I got the cracks stop-drilled,

30:03.667 --> 30:04.867
so they're not
going to spread.

30:04.967 --> 30:06.933
Hopefully, it'll last
the rest of the winter.

all this work to provide
for myself up here,

32:05.667 --> 32:06.833
All right.

32:06.900 --> 32:10.233
Dogs did good five-hour run
getting out here,

32:10.300 --> 32:12.767
so this is a great spot
for me to have a camp,

32:12.833 --> 32:14.967
'cause I'm gonna have to
continue to work

32:15.033 --> 32:18.367
and it's getting to where
it's too far away to
come out here

32:18.433 --> 32:20.767
and spend all day working,
putting trail in

32:20.833 --> 32:22.267
and then have to,
you know, go home.

32:22.333 --> 32:24.767
So this is gonna be great
to have a camp here.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.433
All right, good.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.167
I'm pretty amazed at
how the dogs handled that run.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.667
They're really
coming along nice,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.300
and getting into shape fast.

32:34.367 --> 32:35.833
Time to get the tent up.

32:35.900 --> 32:38.300
I'm just a man
with simple taste.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.400
I like simple things

32:40.467 --> 32:42.567
that I can put together myself

32:42.633 --> 32:44.333
and I don't have to
rely on anybody else.

32:46.333 --> 32:48.000
This is a refuge.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.300
A place of shelter.

32:50.367 --> 32:52.867
Harsh environment up here,
you got to be able to get out
of the weather

32:52.933 --> 32:54.867
and warm up to push hard.

33:06.633 --> 33:08.967
This is a good end
to a good day's work.

33:09.233 --> 33:11.300
Some people think of money
when they think of riches,

33:11.367 --> 33:13.400
I think of lifestyle.

33:13.467 --> 33:17.133
That's what I think
makes you a rich man,
is the life you live.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.167
This is a good
as it gets for me.

33:26.433 --> 33:29.067
GLENN: It's how we spend
our time that's important.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.233
How do you
want to spend your time?

33:39.033 --> 33:41.467
I got some ice
building up along the
edge of my roof here.

33:42.333 --> 33:43.367
Pretty thick.

33:45.033 --> 33:49.333
What happens, heat
from inside melts
the snow on the roof,

33:49.800 --> 33:54.467
and water runs down
and freezes here
and it creates an ice dam.

33:55.733 --> 33:57.000
That's bad.

33:57.333 --> 33:58.967
If I don't
keep it cleaned off,

33:59.033 --> 34:01.600
it builds up real thick and
then when it starts to melt
in the spring,

34:01.667 --> 34:04.633
it gets so wet on my roof that
it'll leak through sometimes.

34:04.700 --> 34:06.700
So I like to keep
the roof all cleaned off.

34:06.767 --> 34:08.667
I'm gonna go up there now
and shovel off the snow,

34:08.733 --> 34:12.267
and then I'm gonna smash
off this ice that's already
built up along the edge.

34:18.267 --> 34:19.733
It is slippery.

34:21.967 --> 34:23.633
I just got to use
common sense,

34:23.700 --> 34:24.867
make sure I don't fall off.

34:36.067 --> 34:37.900
It's just not good
for the roof, too, to be wet.

34:37.967 --> 34:39.567
It's not good for the canvas.
I like to keep it dry,

34:39.633 --> 34:41.433
so I like to keep
it all shovelled off.

34:48.533 --> 34:50.667
The roof used to have
better insulation,

34:50.733 --> 34:52.767
and the heat from the cabin
wouldn't melt the snow

34:52.833 --> 34:54.033
and I wouldn't have a problem
with the ice dam.

34:54.100 --> 34:55.700
Problem is
a grizzly bear got inside,

34:55.767 --> 34:56.900
and it ripped
all the insulation

34:56.967 --> 34:58.333
that I had in the ceiling out.

35:00.033 --> 35:01.167
That's good.
I got the snow off.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.933
Now I just got to go down
and break the ice off.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.600
Roof's gonna
stay drier now.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.800
I don't have to worry
about that ice building
up real thick,

35:11.867 --> 35:13.867
and then trapping
water underneath it

35:13.933 --> 35:16.767
and melting and getting
the roof all wet and soggy.

35:18.467 --> 35:19.567
There.

35:19.633 --> 35:21.833
So I got the roof
all cleaned up.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.300
It's gonna stay dry.

35:23.367 --> 35:25.667
Feel good about that.
It was a productive afternoon.

35:25.867 --> 35:28.767
I'm gonna go inside,
heat up some water
and bathe tonight.

35:32.233 --> 35:34.167
CHIP:
We have a lot of adventure.
We have things to talk about.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.933
We hang together,
we work together.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.400
It's all good.

(SNOWMOBILE ENGINE RUNNING)

35:46.700 --> 35:47.700
You about ready to go?

35:47.767 --> 35:48.767
-Yep.
-All right.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.167
CHIP: Yesterday,
in the evening,

35:52.233 --> 35:54.533
me and Carol got done
setting our rabbit snares.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.333
And we came home
when the sun was going down

35:56.400 --> 35:57.900
and now that the
sun's coming up again,

35:57.967 --> 35:59.933
it's time to go out
and go check them
before the foxes do.

36:11.033 --> 36:12.733
CAROL: Nothing in that one.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.200
CHIP: Well, this one's not
snared very well, Bun.
I'll get him.

36:19.967 --> 36:21.333
He's a fat one.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.767
Ideally, though,
we find 'em dead
in the snares.

36:23.833 --> 36:24.900
When we find 'em
dead in the snares,

36:24.967 --> 36:26.733
the snare's done its job
really well and proper.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.900
I just broke his neck.
I don't want him to suffer.

36:29.400 --> 36:32.033
You know it's not always
perfect, but, um, we got him.

36:32.300 --> 36:33.633
I set the snares...

36:33.700 --> 36:35.333
I'm not the rabbit
that's going into it.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.900
And that's always
unpredictable.

36:37.833 --> 36:38.967
(CAROL SPEAKING)

36:39.033 --> 36:40.433
CHIP: Oh, man.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.900
Look like Mr Fox done
ripped this one off, huh?

36:43.967 --> 36:45.267
CAROL: Yeah.
CHIP: See the fox trail?

36:45.733 --> 36:47.167
See the stick and the wire?

36:47.233 --> 36:49.433
He just broke the wire
and took the rabbit.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.300
'Cause they're out hunting
exact same animals we are,

36:51.367 --> 36:54.033
and if they get a chance,
they'll clean out your whole
trap line.

36:54.533 --> 36:56.767
Mr Fox comes here
and gets a rabbit like that,

36:57.067 --> 36:59.267
he's probably gonna start
checking our other snares.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.400
As soon as we get enough
rabbits out of this place,

37:01.467 --> 37:02.733
we'll just move
our snares, huh?

37:02.800 --> 37:04.167
You want to go
in there and get that?

37:04.233 --> 37:05.600
We won't leave
that wire sitting there.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.800
Look at this, check it out.
Yup, he broke it off.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.800
That's a pretty clean
one there, huh?

37:18.200 --> 37:19.433
But you can see
where he ate the rabbit.

37:19.533 --> 37:23.200
Look, there's fur and blood
and pieces of rabbit.

37:24.500 --> 37:26.100
Must have done it
last night, huh?

37:26.167 --> 37:28.867
Well, let's go check
the rest of 'em before
the day gets too long.

37:37.900 --> 37:38.933
Whoa!

37:40.500 --> 37:42.033
Almost drove past that one.

37:42.767 --> 37:46.333
This one's got prints
from yesterday,
but nothing fresh.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.233
I'd say we leave this
one here, too, huh?

37:48.300 --> 37:49.600
It looks like it's
still in a good place.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.600
If we get at least one,
we can make soup.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.533
If we get several,
we can roast 'em.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.433
So basically, we'll just leave
these ones here that look like
they're really good,

37:56.500 --> 37:57.633
and we'll go home.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.767
We got one bunny,
we can go make some soup.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.233
-You want to go make soup?
-Yeah.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.500
Yeah, if those foxes
hadn't taken two
of our rabbits,

38:03.567 --> 38:05.900
we'd have three,
and we'd be
able to roast 'em.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.533
But I think that'll make
a really good soup.

38:17.067 --> 38:18.233
(CAROL SPEAKING)

38:19.100 --> 38:20.267
Right there.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.267
CHIP: I almost drove by it.
(LAUGHS)

38:23.167 --> 38:24.600
You want to get it? It's dead.

38:25.567 --> 38:27.367
He choked out
like they're supposed to.

38:27.767 --> 38:29.333
Looks like kind of
a young one, huh?

38:29.400 --> 38:31.833
So, he must've got caught
early in the night, huh?
He's frozen.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.400
She knows
where the trails are now.

38:33.467 --> 38:34.900
I know where the trails are.

38:34.967 --> 38:37.233
We got two rabbits,
that'll be good start,
good munch,

38:37.300 --> 38:38.800
and it's a great motivator
for Carol.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.833
And I bet you a million
bucks she'll be taking
my SnoGo

38:40.900 --> 38:43.233
and going down and checking
these snares herself
when she feels like it.

38:43.433 --> 38:45.400
'Cause she's tasted success.

38:45.467 --> 38:46.867
Now that's good effort, Bun.

38:46.933 --> 38:50.800
Let's get home, and,
uh, let's go show these
to your mom.

38:50.867 --> 38:54.333
It's time to head home now
and go see what we can do
with these rabbits.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.833
If my wife
doesn't have a dinner plan,

38:55.900 --> 38:57.467
then the rabbits
will be the dinner plan.

39:00.633 --> 39:02.133
Is that a bit?

39:02.833 --> 39:06.367
Here you go, kids.
We're gonna have ourselves
some rabbits and rabbit food.

39:06.867 --> 39:08.767
This has got a bowl
full of shredded-up carrots,

39:09.300 --> 39:10.933
cabbage, raisins, and apples.

39:11.567 --> 39:13.433
I'd like to take
a picture of that.

I don't know about yours,
but mine's pretty good.

-It's sweet and it's fat.
-Is it spicy?

39:18.867 --> 39:20.167
I must have got
some fat off the fat one.

39:20.233 --> 39:21.433
Yeah, I peppered 'em.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.300
CHIP: Really done good, Carol.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.933
Get ourselves a couple
of rabbits today, huh?

39:29.633 --> 39:31.300
They taste good,
these rabbits.

39:31.367 --> 39:32.933
Yep, we'll get 'em
while they're fat,

39:33.000 --> 39:35.100
'cause it's the time of year
that they're still fat
from summertime.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.733
-CHIP: See how easily
that just falls apart?
-Mmm-hmm.

39:38.300 --> 39:39.867
A lot of times you got to let
'em sit for a day or two.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.933
Especially when
they're real skinny,
they'll be chewy.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.500
These aren't chewy at all.
They're perfect.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.033
-Nope. They're perfect.
-Yep.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.733
-Here's a heart for you.
-Thank you, Mom.

to get a lot more.

I love living
out in the woods.

39:56.900 --> 39:58.500
That's why I moved to Alaska.

40:08.433 --> 40:09.833
There were a lot of
things over the years

40:09.900 --> 40:12.267
that I had to learn
in order to live out here.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.333
I didn't know
a lot of practical skills

40:14.400 --> 40:15.467
that I've picked up
over the years,

40:15.533 --> 40:16.967
so it's been
interesting for me.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.633
There's a lot of variety
in the work.

40:19.700 --> 40:20.733

40:21.400 --> 40:25.067
Working on a plastic sled,
melting that and reforming it.

40:25.367 --> 40:26.767
Got the roof all cleaned up.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.133
It's gonna stay dry.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.233
I feel good about that.
It was a productive afternoon.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.800

nothing like it.

Get it over to the Twinkie,

and I'll definitely
have power.

41:53.433 --> 41:55.000
Is it a perfect fix? No.

But it gets me,
what I need, done.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.033
It's not an ideal situation.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.667
It's not a win-win.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.567
But it's a
winning enough hand.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.467
As soon as I sourced
what the issue was
with the 8 KW,

42:06.533 --> 42:09.900
and I can't resolve
it instantly, backup plan.

42:09.967 --> 42:11.433

All right, so hopefully...

42:29.633 --> 42:30.900
There we go.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.233
I have electricity.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.367
Yay!

42:36.800 --> 42:38.533
Well, this kind of rounds
everything out.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.167
In the last 24 hours,

42:40.400 --> 42:42.533
I landed,
I got my shelter secure.

42:43.033 --> 42:46.000
Those spotlights
are gonna keep
that wolverine at bay.

42:46.333 --> 42:49.367
The big predators
do not like the lights.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.800
Now I can go in and I can
enjoy the Northern Lights

42:53.200 --> 42:56.067
without worrying about
the wolverine enjoying me.

42:56.167 --> 42:58.033
So, all in all, success.
