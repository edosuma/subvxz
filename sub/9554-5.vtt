01:45.339 --> 01:47.041
I was just dancing.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.641
Yes, Officer?

01:48.642 --> 01:50.711
I'm looking
for Arthur Fonzarelli.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.680
Oh, Arthur, here you are.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.816
Don't worry, Officer,
I got everything under control.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.084
Are you Fonzarelli?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.416
No, but it's a common mistake.

02:01.155 --> 02:03.190
Trying some more
of your cute stuff, huh, kid?

02:03.190 --> 02:04.391
Ah, he's a good boy, Officer.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.059
Fonzarelli's in his office.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.528
I'll go get him.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.196
Aw, great!
He's the men's room attendant?

02:09.196 --> 02:12.066
Are you kidding?
The men's room attendant?

02:12.066 --> 02:14.567
Ha, yeah. You tell him that.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.271
Hey, Fonzie,
there's a man out here for you.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.206
FONZIE:
Al, I'm on the phone!

02:19.206 --> 02:22.209
He's wearing a badge.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.200
I'm off the phone!

02:31.285 --> 02:33.252
I'm Fonzarelli. What's up?

02:33.253 --> 02:35.489
(laughs)
He thought I was you.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.480
Whoa!

02:41.562 --> 02:44.163
I didn't do nothing!
I was framed, I tell you!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.399
Badge, you talk.

02:45.399 --> 02:48.102
- It was 2:30 in the afternoon.
- Yeah?

02:48.102 --> 02:51.472
I spotted the subject
selling ties on the street.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.841
Ugly ties.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.476
And I think they're hot.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.411
They're not hot,
just inexpensive.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.613
Well, Why'd you bring him to me?
I don't wear ties.

02:59.613 --> 03:02.116
Well, it's all here right here
on the school card.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.183
We couldn't locate his mother.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.952
His father's deceased.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.989
And the school card listed you
as the next closest relative.

03:08.989 --> 03:10.557
Now, let me get this straight.
You got a badge.

03:10.557 --> 03:11.858
You got a kid selling ties.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.260
Have you got a charge?

03:13.260 --> 03:14.428
I'm a truant officer.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.661
He's playing hooky.

03:15.662 --> 03:16.830
Second time this week.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.098
-(snaps fingers)
- Get over here.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.366
What are you trying to do?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.902
Worry your mother
to a frazzle, huh?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.638
Now, I promise you,
the Fonz promises you,

03:24.638 --> 03:26.206
he'll be at school tomorrow.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.038
Or at least pieces of him
will be.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.577
All right.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.280
- I'll consider this case closed.
- Yeah.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.749
Hey. kid?

03:35.749 --> 03:38.919
Are you sure "stupido" means
"truant officer" in Italian?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.621
Sure!

03:40.621 --> 03:42.022
What else?

03:42.022 --> 03:44.024
Well, I'm gonna look it up!

03:44.024 --> 03:46.560
Well, see you, Officer.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.797
I'll tell you,
that guy's got some nerve.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.632
I was cleaning up
before he came along.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.100
Button it up.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.102
That's not the point, Chachi.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.837
You should be in school!

03:56.837 --> 03:58.939
RICHIE:
Fonz!

03:58.939 --> 04:01.408
Hey, Fonz!

04:01.408 --> 04:03.399
I got to tell you something.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.078
You should've been

04:06.079 --> 04:07.847
at the girl's
volleyball game today, Fonz.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.416
One of the girls forgot
to wear her...

04:09.416 --> 04:12.352
- Richie, this is not...
- And...

04:12.352 --> 04:14.688
Chachi. Cut school.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.923
Truant officer. Tell him.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.156
Isn't he a little young to hear

04:18.158 --> 04:19.892
about a girl
who forgot to wear her...

04:19.892 --> 04:21.194
Not about a girl.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.130
About school.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.498
- Oh!
- Tell him.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.433
Oh, cut school?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.702
Oh, Chachi, you ought to know
better than that.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.204
You just can't go around
cutting school.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.104
- That's just not a nice...
- Uh, Cunningham, you don't have

04:32.105 --> 04:34.341
to be polite;
he is a family disgrace.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.642
You should be in school.

04:35.642 --> 04:36.776
Tell him!

04:36.777 --> 04:38.377
But I don't do good in school.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.913
I hate it! It's boring!

04:39.913 --> 04:41.715
I mean, who cares
about the Civil War?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.046
We won.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.621
Well, um, maybe
if you were doing better,

04:47.621 --> 04:48.722
y-you'd like it more.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.923
Aw, come on.

04:49.923 --> 04:52.192
The only subject
I'm not behind in is lunch.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.894
A-All right, all right, okay.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.462
How about...
how about getting a tutor?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.397
Cunningham,
we're talking school here,

04:57.397 --> 04:59.332
not playing horns.

04:59.333 --> 05:01.767
Oh, Fonz, remember when I...
when I helped you with school?

05:01.768 --> 05:04.904
That's all a tutor is,
just a private instructor.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.674
I knew that.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.743
I just wanted you
to explain it to him.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.944
How about that, huh?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.343
Cunningham's gonna toot you.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.082
Oh, me?

05:15.082 --> 05:16.315
Fonz...

05:16.316 --> 05:17.884
Well, you see,
I'm-I'm in college now.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.518
I got a lot of reading to do,

05:19.519 --> 05:22.288
and, you know,
term papers, and...

05:22.289 --> 05:23.789
I've been seeing Laurie Beth.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.425
You know, the cheerleader?

05:25.425 --> 05:26.693
And you know how it is.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.058
- Sis-boom-bah!
- Yeah.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.231
I totally understand, you know?

05:31.231 --> 05:33.200
Those sis-boom-bahs
can tire you right out.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.402
- Yeah.
- Especially those boom-bahs.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.104
CHACHI:
I don't want a tutor anyway.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.572
Forget school.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.439
I'm making 35 bucks a week.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.242
Chicken feed.

05:42.242 --> 05:44.444
Well, it's more than those nerds
at school make.

05:44.444 --> 05:45.679
No. no. no, no.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.215
Uh, statistics show
that high school graduates

05:48.215 --> 05:50.484
earn more per capita
than high school dropouts.

05:50.484 --> 05:52.286
And then if you become
a college graduate,

05:52.286 --> 05:53.420
why, the difference is
just drastically...

05:53.420 --> 05:55.289
Uh, Cunningham,
Cunningham, Cunningham?

05:55.289 --> 05:57.990
You see how smart
school can make you?

05:57.991 --> 06:01.228
Just make it more interesting
next time, will you?

06:01.228 --> 06:03.063
Yeah, but school's a drag.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.998
Hey, let me tell you something.
You trust me.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.766
School is cool.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.668
If you say so.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.303
I say so.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.570
Now, what are we gonna do
about this tutoring jazz?

06:11.571 --> 06:13.706
Well, what about Joanie?

06:13.707 --> 06:14.975
- I think it might be good.
- Huh?

06:14.975 --> 06:17.945
Because she's closer
to his grade anyway.

06:17.945 --> 06:19.980
I'm liking it better already.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.081
(chuckles)

06:21.081 --> 06:23.784
Me and Blue Eyes? Wah-wah-wah.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.452
Well, I got to go, Fonz.

06:25.452 --> 06:28.221
I got a lot more ties to sell.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.422
Yeah, Fonz?

06:29.423 --> 06:31.792
School is your business now.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.759
Oh, Fonz, I can't.

06:33.760 --> 06:34.961
I need the loot.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.829
I got to help out at home.

06:36.830 --> 06:39.066
All right, here's the plan.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.400
You do good in school,
you show me good grades,

06:41.401 --> 06:44.104
I'll give you a part-time job
with me at the garage.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.640
- You mean it?
- Hey, I'm a man of my word.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.241
Boy, working side by side
with you, Fonz.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.376
You got a deal.

06:50.377 --> 06:52.346
All right.

06:52.346 --> 06:54.348
- Hey, thanks, Richie.
- Oh, it's all right.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.948
Now, what do you think
Joanie's gonna want

06:55.949 --> 06:57.184
for helping him at school?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.617
Oh, just some pocket money.

06:58.618 --> 06:59.285
Yeah.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.554
A whip and a chair.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.545
(both laugh)

07:03.957 --> 07:07.194
CHACHI: Hey, the tie looks
great on you, Mr. C.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.526
Yeah, it's my favorite color.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.468
Well...

07:15.469 --> 07:17.838
I'm ready.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.872
Hi-ya, Blue Eyes.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.707
Wah-wah-wah.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.109
Oh, and if he starts with that,
I want time and a half.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.678
No, no, a deal's a deal.

07:24.678 --> 07:28.115
Come on, Howard,
let's leave them alone to study.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.449
I am not going
to leave Wah-Wah-Wah

07:30.450 --> 07:33.086
and Blue Eyes alone.

07:33.086 --> 07:34.321
Richard?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.023
Aw, Dad, I can't.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.492
I... I'm going with Laurie Beth.
I promised her.

07:38.492 --> 07:41.595
We're gonna go out and take
a little moonlight stroll.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.330
Do it in the morning.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.300
Aw, you're a real
joker, Dad. He's...

07:49.036 --> 07:51.370
All right, Chachi,
let's get started.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.362
I teach, you learn.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.214
Dad, please.

08:01.214 --> 08:04.117
All right, Joanie,
I can see you're in charge.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.854
But I'll be at the top of the
stairs listening for your call.

08:07.854 --> 08:10.846
A simple "help" will do.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.294
All right,
you're behind at school,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.229
but that doesn't mean
you can't make it up.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.399
The secret is just keep
your mind on your work.

08:19.399 --> 08:20.400
Right.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.735
You want to dance first

08:21.735 --> 08:23.537
or go right on
to the heavy stuff?

08:23.537 --> 08:27.741
You want a broken nose first
or go right on to the hospital?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.476
You got spirit.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.777
I love older women.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.379
Let's run away together.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.448
How far can we run?

08:34.448 --> 08:36.750
You got to be in by 10:00.

08:36.750 --> 08:41.051
Now, we either begin to study
or I will call my father.

08:41.988 --> 08:43.456
And then I'll call Fonzie.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.957
- Oh, right, uh...
- Yeah.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.861
I have a test tomorrow, and
here are some sample questions.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.196
MARION:
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

08:49.196 --> 08:52.299
But before you start,
could you come up and help me?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.266
I'm trying to fix
the hem on a dress,

08:54.267 --> 08:56.536
and your father is too short.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.539
And... he's also, you know,
a little bit...

08:59.539 --> 09:00.540
JOAN I E:
Fat.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.776
(shushes)
Come on.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.643
Okay, you look over
your homework,

09:04.644 --> 09:06.546
and I'll be right back.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.709
Why don't you, uh, slip into
something more comfortable?

09:11.000 --> 09:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:18.058 --> 09:19.159
Hello, Tony?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.026
Yeah, Chachi.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.530
Hey, you know
that test you swiped?

09:23.530 --> 09:26.022
Well, I'm gonna get
the answers right now.

09:33.507 --> 09:35.342
Hey, Fonz! Fonz!

09:35.342 --> 09:36.343
I did it!

09:36.343 --> 09:37.344
How dare you?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.478
Would you walk into a...

09:38.478 --> 09:40.380
into an operating room
like that?

09:40.380 --> 09:42.182
Oh, but, Fonz, I got a hundred.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.117
How'd you sell that many ties?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.152
What'd you do, sell them
to a marching band?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.288
Not ties,
I got a hundred on my test.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.556
A perfect score.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.991
Are you snowing me?

09:50.991 --> 09:51.992
No.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.859
Hey, your Fonzarelli blood

09:53.860 --> 09:55.829
finally made it
up to your brain, huh?

09:55.829 --> 09:57.764
I'm proud of you,
I'm proud of you.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.399
All right, Chachi, all right.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.635
You got a job.

10:01.635 --> 10:05.504
♪ Dun-da-dun-dun-da-da! ♪

10:05.505 --> 10:07.407
I want you to have this.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.675
An old mechanic's hat?

10:08.675 --> 10:11.645
Don't you make fun
of a historical monument.

10:11.645 --> 10:14.546
This is my first hat.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.851
Oh, your first hat?

10:17.851 --> 10:18.885
Can I keep it?

10:18.885 --> 10:20.620
- Yea h .
- Wow.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.956
Boys gave it to me
when I souped up my first car.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.925
What was I?
I was, uh, seven and a half.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.493
(chuckles)

10:26.493 --> 10:28.093
Well, I got to take a look-see.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.359
Hey, I bet you Joanie will
dig a man in uniform.

10:35.502 --> 10:38.672
I tell you something,
I am very proud of that guy.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.807
Now I know
how Eisenhower's mother felt.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.443
You know what I mean?
(laughs)

10:43.443 --> 10:45.445
Hi, Fonz.

10:45.445 --> 10:48.848
Well, the Cunningham offspring.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.783
Oh, that lousy Mr. Wah-Wah-Wah!

10:50.784 --> 10:52.085
All right, calm down, Joanie.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.688
- That little cheat stole a test!
- Calm down.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.655
That rat fink tricked me
into giving him the answers!

10:56.656 --> 10:58.525
I'll give him cheat!

10:58.525 --> 10:59.526
Will you calm down?!

10:59.526 --> 11:00.694
No, you calm down, Red.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.362
Now, what is the skinny here?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.630
- Well, it's what she said.
- JOANIE: Yeah.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.497
And he's been suspended
for two weeks.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.500
A suspended head in my hat?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.669
Pretty good, huh?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
Hi-ya, Blue Eyes.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.661
How do you like it?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.731
Wah-wah-wah!

11:17.577 --> 11:19.145
Is it on crooked?

11:19.145 --> 11:21.375
It isn't the hat
that's crooked, buddy!

11:26.052 --> 11:27.620
What'd he mean by that?

11:27.621 --> 11:29.389
They mean that you're crooked.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.258
That hundred?
You cheated, didn't you?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.891
So?

11:32.892 --> 11:35.395
So?! My cousin don't cheat!

11:35.395 --> 11:37.497
What do you got to say
besides "so"?!

11:37.497 --> 11:39.899
- What do I got to say?
- Yeah.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.334
I'll tell you what.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.602
I don't need your stinking job!

11:42.602 --> 11:44.204
I've been doing
all right without it!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.373
Without you, without school,
without anybody!

11:46.373 --> 11:48.540
And I'll tell you
something else, Fonzarelli.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.532
I don't need your stupid cap!

11:53.647 --> 11:55.376
"Stupid can"?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.385
"Stupid cap"?!

11:58.385 --> 12:01.787
It's a very good thing
that I don't got a bad temper.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.303
♪ La, la, la, la,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.406

12:19.406 --> 12:20.974

12:20.974 --> 12:22.976
And Chachi
almost got me suspended

12:22.976 --> 12:25.178
because they thought
I was an accomplice.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.415
Well, Arthur will have
a little talk with Chachi.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.250
Well, that's the problem.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.786
Fonzi refuses to talk to Chachi.

12:32.786 --> 12:36.755
Well, speaking as an adult,
in most circumstances,

12:36.756 --> 12:40.026
a child feels a lot better
when he's talked to.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.529
Talk? You always yell at me!

12:42.529 --> 12:43.930
That makes me feel better.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.532
Parents!

12:45.532 --> 12:48.001
<i>I'm going to Jenny Pint-Mo's
to see the sf ides</i>

12:48.001 --> 12:50.637
of her vacation at Sunny Slopes.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.540
Sunny Slopes?
That's a nudist colony!

12:53.540 --> 12:54.973
Joanie!

12:54.974 --> 12:56.576
Feel better, Dad?
(chuckles)

12:56.576 --> 12:59.479
Howard, here.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.615
Hey, evening, Cunningham family.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.318
Look, I just found your paper
on my doorstep again.

13:05.318 --> 13:07.287
Your newsboy's got a great arm.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.389
Why aren't you talking?

13:09.389 --> 13:11.157
I thought I did.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.792
- To Chachi.
- No!

13:12.792 --> 13:14.527
Oh, now you're angry.
I understand.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.062
I'm not angry.

13:16.062 --> 13:20.166
I don't talk to short people
that tell me to get lost.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.435
Fonzie, Chachi has a problem.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.703
Now, you can't ignore him.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.005
Look, Mr. C,
I gave that boy a plan,

13:26.005 --> 13:27.607
he threw it back in my face.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.842
He's on his own.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.477
He's just a little boy!

13:30.477 --> 13:34.346
Well, so was I when I got caught
on the swings in kindergarten.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.049
The teacher said,
"You got yourself up there,

13:36.049 --> 13:38.381
you get yourself down."

13:40.353 --> 13:41.554
So what'd you do then?

13:41.554 --> 13:43.215
I climbed down,
I chased her up there!

13:46.693 --> 13:49.629
Well, good for you.

13:49.629 --> 13:52.198
Marion, that is not
the problem here.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.767
You're absolutely right.
You're absolutely right, Mr. C.

13:54.768 --> 13:56.703
It's not the problem.
It's Chachi's.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.505
It's up to him.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.507
Boy, just like a parent.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.208
I'm not the kid's parent, Red.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.644
Fonzie...

14:04.644 --> 14:07.280
Stay with me, will you, Marion?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.783
Now, look, the boy
doesn't have a father.

14:09.783 --> 14:13.583
He needs someone he can
look up to, a-a male figure.

14:17.757 --> 14:20.093
He does look up to you
like a father, Fonz.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.594
A lot of people do.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.530
Do you have any idea
how many times

14:24.531 --> 14:26.466
I tried to tell him
to get lost?

14:26.466 --> 14:27.734
You did?

14:27.734 --> 14:30.335
Well, not in so many words.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.406
But, see, the important thing
is that he never did.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.575
I always knew he'd be there.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.744
FONZIE:
The subject is close-amundo!

14:37.744 --> 14:42.682
Now, look, I really appreciate
what you're all trying to do,

14:42.682 --> 14:45.218
but there's the Fonzarelli code
that says,

14:45.218 --> 14:49.355
"if someone slams a door
in your face..." Huh?

14:49.355 --> 14:50.690
"...you don't ring the doorbell

14:50.690 --> 14:53.455
so they can slam it back
in your face again!" Whoa!

14:55.495 --> 14:58.598
Well, he certainly made
his position very clear.

14:58.598 --> 15:02.569
Oh, Howard, what am I gonna
do with this?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.469
Knit on it, Marion.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.147
(slurping)

15:14.147 --> 15:15.842
<i>II</i>

15:17.183 --> 15:19.585
- Hi, Al.
- Hi, Rich.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.855
How many has he had?

15:21.855 --> 15:24.257
He's been here
since this morning.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.726
Hey, Al, hurry up
with my drink.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.995
Oh, and bring one
for my friend here.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.760
See that? Try to talk some sense
into him, will you?

15:35.869 --> 15:39.204
Chachi.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.440
Look, I-l know you're...

15:40.440 --> 15:43.408
you're busted up
over this Fonzie thing, but...

15:43.409 --> 15:44.644
What Fonzie thing?

15:44.644 --> 15:46.713
There's this chick,
you know what I mean?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.413
Oh, it's-it's a girl, huh?

15:48.414 --> 15:50.249
<i>Yeah, Boom Boom Lame.</i>

15:50.250 --> 15:51.618
Huh, Boom Boom.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.353
She dumped you?

15:53.353 --> 15:56.656
Yeah, yeah.
She ran off with a TV star.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.691
I think it was Snooky Lanson.

15:58.691 --> 15:59.892
I'll get over it.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.426
Yeah.

16:01.427 --> 16:04.697
Well, uh...
you want to tell me about it?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.365
Hey, listen, Cunningham,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.535
don't try any of this
child psychologyjunk on me.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.204
All right, all right,
you're right.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.841
We don't need those games...
do we, pal?

16:14.841 --> 16:17.377
Think I'm dumb enough
for that old buddy routine?

16:17.377 --> 16:20.046
Ha.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.714
Routine?!

16:21.714 --> 16:23.549
Let me tell you something,
squirt!

16:23.550 --> 16:26.251
I've had enough of this stuff!
And let me tell you...!

16:26.252 --> 16:28.454
And don't try
the anger bit, either.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.944
I'm hip to that one, too.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.163
All right.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.732
All right,
I got one last routine left.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.101
- Oh, yeah? What's that? -Yeah,
it's a totally new approach.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.102
What's that?

16:43.102 --> 16:45.404
Truth, honesty.

16:45.405 --> 16:46.905
That's a new one.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.276
Well, it's not new,
but it's the best.

16:50.276 --> 16:53.880
Look, I know it's tough
getting kicked out of school.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.648
School isn't important.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.617
Mr. Super Cool dropped out.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.052
Oh, true, true.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.453
But Fonzie
was cool enough to know

17:00.453 --> 17:02.021
that he wanted to go back
and finish later.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.923
- And you know why?
- Because he wanted to.

17:03.923 --> 17:05.258
Well, that's what
he tells everybody,

17:05.258 --> 17:06.526
but that's not the real reason.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.560
- It isn't?
- No.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.363
No, it was pride.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.998
Fonzie couldn't stand
being a quitter.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.433
He had to prove something.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.102
He had to prove that he could
finish anything that he started.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.270
I can do that.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.705
- Sure you can.
- But I don't want to.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.907
I mean, I'm not gonna go
crawling back

17:21.907 --> 17:23.309
and apologize
to some principal.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.111
- Well, you don't have to crawl.
- Forget it!

17:25.111 --> 17:27.180
It's the code.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.844
Fonzie says, "You made
your bed bad, you get wrinkled."

17:33.353 --> 17:36.489
All right,
keep your stupid codes,

17:36.489 --> 17:38.424
because I've had it.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.793
Fair enough.

Oh, and, uh, I'll tell you
what I'll do, Cunningham.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.130
I'll even take back
your old man's tie.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.364

So, he thinks
he's got problems, huh?

18:34.847 --> 18:36.015
Yeah.

18:36.015 --> 18:38.217
Ever tell you
about Rosa Coletti?

18:38.217 --> 18:40.019
Yeah.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.488
I first met Rosa in '34.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.157
No, no, it was 1935.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.827
She was a tiny girl.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.125
Shiny black hair...

18:51.564 --> 18:53.054
(engine revving)

18:56.436 --> 18:57.801
Fonz?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.907
Fonz?!

19:00.907 --> 19:03.274
Fonz, would you cut the noise?!

19:05.611 --> 19:08.314
Noise?

19:08.314 --> 19:10.449
You calling this noise?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.517
This symphony of pistons?

19:12.518 --> 19:15.955
(hums Beethoven's
No. <i>5</i> Symphony)

19:15.955 --> 19:18.024
No, it's-it's real nice, Fonz.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.126
Look, I-l got somebody
waiting outside,

19:20.126 --> 19:23.663
and, uh, well, he'd like to try
and get a job here.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.699
Hey, I don't need any help.
You think Beethoven needed help?

19:26.699 --> 19:29.068
Well, maybe I could just
bring him in,

19:29.068 --> 19:31.604
and-and you could give him
an interview or something, okay?

19:31.604 --> 19:34.040
What's his name, Cunningham?

19:34.040 --> 19:36.374
Charles Arcola.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.210
Chachi?

19:38.211 --> 19:43.249
In your own words, Richard,
"Ha-ha-ha."

19:43.249 --> 19:44.851
It didn't work.
I've got no openings.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.216
I'm sorry. I can't use him.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.189
- Hey, Fonz.
- Yeah?

19:50.189 --> 19:53.826
How come you didn't just,
uh, send this heap

19:53.826 --> 19:55.695
over to the-the wrecking yard?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.997
I didn'tjunk it
for two reasons:

19:57.997 --> 20:01.300
one, the pay might make
tune-up history, (chuckles)

20:01.300 --> 20:03.369
and two, it was a challenge.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.305
I climbed the peak in Motorland.

20:06.305 --> 20:09.108
I think most guys would have
just left it to rot.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.811
Most guys would have had to.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.880
Right.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.150
Don't you think Chachi deserves
the same kind of consideration?

20:17.150 --> 20:19.185
Richie, this is a car.

20:19.185 --> 20:22.855
It needs a new starter,
pistons, brakes, transmission,

20:22.855 --> 20:25.624
a little time,
a little attention.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.728
"Little time, little attention."

20:28.728 --> 20:31.164
I get your drift,
but it didn't work.

20:31.164 --> 20:33.199
Your trick didn't work.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.567
Bring him in, anyway.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.068
Oh, oh, great.
All right, thanks, Fonz.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.370
Just a second.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.006
Chachi! Hey, Chachi,
come on, come on!

20:40.006 --> 20:42.542
Hurry, hurry!

20:42.542 --> 20:45.111
Chachi, Fonz...

20:45.111 --> 20:48.915
why don't you two just, uh,
have a little chat, okay?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.885
Just converse a little bit,
all right?

20:55.822 --> 20:57.654
Hi.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.765
Nice weather we're having.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.995
It'll do.

21:12.638 --> 21:13.939
Well?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.208
I'm looking for a job.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.877
You ever work in
a garage before, Mr. Arcola?

21:17.877 --> 21:19.178
Briefly.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.981
Well, let me tell you something,
Mr. Arcola.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.016
You work in this garage,

21:24.016 --> 21:27.052
every employee has
certain requirements to fill.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.054
Like what?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.956
Like what? Like number one:

21:29.956 --> 21:31.756
employee must be in school.
No kick-outs.

21:31.757 --> 21:32.858
I am in school.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.459
You ain't
for the next two weeks.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.695
I'm back in school now!

21:35.695 --> 21:38.563
- Don't you yell at me.
- Sorry.

21:38.564 --> 21:40.666
I had a little talk
with the principal.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.501
He let me back in on trial.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.736
I sold myself.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.371
How many ties went with you?

21:45.371 --> 21:47.273
Oh, lots. I had a one-cent sale.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.374
He couldn't resist them.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.569
(laughs)

21:52.678 --> 21:55.114
Requirement number two:

21:55.114 --> 21:58.117
employee must apologize
to former employer

21:58.117 --> 22:00.052
for getting uppity.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.153
Uppity?

22:01.153 --> 22:04.657
That's right, uppity.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.293
All right, uppity.

22:07.293 --> 22:10.963
Tell my former employer
I'm sorry I got uppity

22:10.963 --> 22:14.266
and it won't happen
no more, okay?

22:14.267 --> 22:15.867
- Okay.
- Do I get the job?

22:15.868 --> 22:18.704
I don't know.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.473
Now, look, Chach, I don't think
it's gonna work out, you know?

22:21.474 --> 22:25.342
You remind me too much
of myself when I was your age.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.049
On the other hand, look at me.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.813
I turned out perfect-amundo.

22:38.858 --> 22:42.228
Hmm.

22:42.228 --> 22:45.965
All right, we'll give it
one more shot.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.700
Ah, that's great, Fonz!

22:47.700 --> 22:48.701
That's great! Thanks!

22:48.701 --> 22:50.303
What do you want me to do?

22:50.303 --> 22:52.238
I want you to clean my office.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.340
Clean the office. Oh, sure.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.542
First thing in the morning.

22:56.542 --> 23:00.046
But first I want to go see
Cindy Turtleback.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.715
Wah-wah-wah.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.183
(Snaps fingers)

23:04.183 --> 23:05.384
Yeah, Fonz?

23:05.384 --> 23:09.655
There's a time for work
and a time for wah-wah.

23:09.655 --> 23:11.323
And with work,
comes responsibility.

23:11.324 --> 23:12.458
You get my drift?

23:12.458 --> 23:13.693
Yeah, I guess you're right.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.759
- Don't guess.
- You're right.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.961
That's right.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.431
I want you to put this
in your back pocket.

23:18.431 --> 23:19.565
Look like a mechanic.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.467
Thanks, Fonz.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.102
- Mm-hmm.
- Clean the office.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.170
That's right.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.770
I'll start with the calendar.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.907
I can't wait to do
Miss Carburetor.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.275
Keep your eyes off
that calendar!

23:33.512 --> 23:37.082

la, la, la ♪

23:37.083 --> 23:41.042

23:45.758 --> 23:48.294
So, how'd you do
on the chemistry test, Rich?

23:48.294 --> 23:50.161
- Got a B-plus.
- Figures.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.789
How'd you do, Potsie?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.034
The guy's got it in for me.

23:55.034 --> 23:59.005
The guy's got it in for you?
(chuckles)

23:59.005 --> 24:01.606
Potsie, you blew up
the man's lab.

24:01.607 --> 24:04.877
It was only half a table.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.971
Besides, his eyebrows
will grow back.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.550
Come on, Malph. We got to go
pick up those blind dates.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.385
Oh, yeah.
Pots, wear your tie.

24:13.386 --> 24:15.955
I told the girls
we were roving ambassadors.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.549
- What country's Roving?
- No.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.761
Fun-loving guys.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.991
Yeah, they're nice.
(chuckles)

24:25.464 --> 24:27.023
(sighs):
Ah, Richie...

24:28.501 --> 24:31.095
Ever tell you about
Rosa Coletti?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.406
Yeah.

24:33.406 --> 24:36.442
I first met Rosa in '34.

24:36.442 --> 24:37.675
Or was it '35?

24:37.676 --> 24:38.911
'35, Al.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.247
That's right.
I'll never forget her.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.648
Neither will I.

24:42.648 --> 24:45.117
She was a-a tiny girl.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.988
BOTH:
Shiny black hair...

24:48.988 --> 24:50.855
big brown eyes...

24:50.856 --> 24:54.026
