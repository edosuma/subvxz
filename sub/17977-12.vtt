00:10.933 --> 00:12.133
PREVIOUSLY ON THE L WORD...

00:12.167 --> 00:13.633
THIS IS BETTE,
ANGELICA'S OTHER MOTHER.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.333
THANKS FOR LETTING US
HANG WITH ANGELICA TODAY.

00:15.367 --> 00:16.633
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A PICTURE?

00:16.667 --> 00:18.300
A FAMILY PICTURE.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.933
YOU'RE ANGELICA'S
INTENDED PARENT.

00:21.967 --> 00:23.100
CALIFORNIA COURT

00:23.133 --> 00:24.833
WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY
GRANT THE ADOPTION.

00:24.867 --> 00:25.833
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

00:25.867 --> 00:27.300
I DON'T WANT
50/50 JOINT CUSTODY.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.133
DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET OUT OF CHILD SUPPORT.

00:29.167 --> 00:33.133
I...WANT...SOLE CUSTODY.

00:34.767 --> 00:35.967
[DOCTOR]: HER BLOOD PRESSURE
STARTED TO FALL,

00:36.000 --> 00:38.667
AND IN SPITE
OF OUR BEST EFFORTS,

00:38.700 --> 00:42.667
HER HEART FAILED
AND WE COULDN'T BRING HER BACK.

00:48.433 --> 00:49.800
YOU GOING TO SELL OUT?

00:49.833 --> 00:51.967
START SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.367
IF YOU THINK MEN
ARE THE ENEMY,

00:53.400 --> 00:55.800
THEN YOU AND I
HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:55.833 --> 00:56.933
I'M HER GIRLFRIEND.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.800
WE LIVE
IN THE SAME HOUSE,

00:58.833 --> 01:01.533
AND WE SLEEP IN THE SAME BED,
MOTHER.

01:01.567 --> 01:03.367
GET OUT, BOTH OF YOU.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.133
WOULD YOU MARRY ME?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.767
YES.

[LARA]: IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A MEXICAN WEDDING CAKE.

03:44.967 --> 03:46.333
IT'S GOT PINEAPPLE
AND WALNUTS IN IT.

03:46.367 --> 03:48.467
[ALICE]: WELL, LARA,
YOU'RE A CULINARY GENIUS.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.500
[JENNY]:
DO YOU GUYS THINK

03:49.533 --> 03:50.700
THAT SHANE'S GOING TO
GO THROUGH WITH IT?

03:50.733 --> 03:52.200
[BETTE]: I HAVE TO ADMIT,

03:52.233 --> 03:53.600
I'M A LITTLE BIT SURPRISED
THAT SHE'S GOTTEN THIS FAR.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.067
ALL I CAN SAY IS

03:55.067 --> 03:56.267
SHE'D BETTER
GO THROUGH WITH IT,

03:56.300 --> 03:57.867
BECAUSE I'VE BOOKED 15 ROOMS

03:57.900 --> 03:59.767
AT THE FAIRMONT
CHATEAU WHISTLER.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.467
NOT TO MENTION THE...
WHAT ELSE IS IT?

04:01.500 --> 04:04.067
A LAY MINISTER,
THE CHAPEL...

04:04.067 --> 04:05.300
THE FONDUE.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.600
THE FONDUE,
THE BACHELOR PARTY.

04:07.633 --> 04:08.900
THAT'S VERY
GENEROUS OF YOU.

04:08.933 --> 04:11.200
IT'S NICE TO HAVE RICH FRIENDS,
ISN'T IT?

04:11.233 --> 04:12.600
MM-HMM.

04:12.633 --> 04:13.733
YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES ME...

04:13.767 --> 04:15.233
IT MAKES ME HAPPY
TO DO IT,

04:15.267 --> 04:18.067
BECAUSE SHANE
DOESN'T HAVE ANY FAMILY,

04:18.100 --> 04:19.533
AND CARMEN...
I DON'T KNOW

04:19.567 --> 04:20.867
IF ANY OF THEM
ARE COMING.

04:20.900 --> 04:22.233
ARE ANY OF HER
FAMILY COMING?

04:22.267 --> 04:23.767
YEAH, I THINK SO.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.100
OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS
HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT SHANE?

04:25.133 --> 04:26.133
DO YOU KNOW?

04:26.167 --> 04:27.533
WHAT?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.100
THAT SHANE'S MEETING HER DAD
TOMORROW?

04:29.133 --> 04:30.833
I THOUGHT SHANE
WAS AN ORPHAN.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.533
A COUPLE
OF WEEKS AGO,

04:32.567 --> 04:35.067
HER DAD'S WIFE
WAS IN THE BEAUTY SALON

04:35.067 --> 04:36.300
OR WHATEVER,

04:36.333 --> 04:37.433
AND SHE WAS READING
ANGELENO MAGAZINE...

04:37.467 --> 04:38.933
I DID THAT.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.167
OH, RIGHT,
THAT PIECE ABOUT WAX.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.933
AND SHE GAVE IT
TO HER DAD,

04:41.967 --> 04:43.833
AND THE DAD CALLED.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.367
WELL, SHANE'S DAD'S
WIFE SAW THE PIECE.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.733
ANYWAY, SHANE IS GOING
TO OREGON CITY

04:47.767 --> 04:50.100
TO VISIT GABRIEL McCUTCHEON.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.167
WOW.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.800
THAT'S DEEP.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.900
I THINK I'M GOING TO GO,
YOU GUYS.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.700
BYE, LARA.

05:00.733 --> 05:01.900
THE CAKE
WAS FANTASTIC.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.067
OH, THANK YOU.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.800
BYE, ALICE.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.400
BYE!

05:09.200 --> 05:10.233
HEY, ALICE?

05:10.267 --> 05:11.533
YEAH?

05:11.567 --> 05:14.300
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:16.600 --> 05:17.967
YEAH.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.167
I AM.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.233
I JUST HAVE A LOT TO DO,

05:20.267 --> 05:22.300
WITH THE WEDDING
AND EVERYTHING.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.567
THANKS FOR ASKING.

05:41.267 --> 05:42.400
NO, I DON'T WANT CARMEN
TO KNOW.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.867
I DON'T WANT
TO GET HER HOPES UP.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.967
JUST MAKE SURE THE HOTEL
IS HOLDING THE ROOMS, ALL RIGHT?

05:47.067 --> 05:48.967
YOU SHOULD SEE CARMEN.

05:49.067 --> 05:51.300
SHE LOOKS INCREDIBLE.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.433
FINE.

05:52.467 --> 05:54.200
I'VE GOT TO GO.
BYE.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.467
TWIST AND TURN
AND SHAKE IT ALL OUT.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.067
AAH!

05:58.067 --> 05:59.067
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.433
SHOULD I GO, LIKE,
BRIDAL FEMME,

06:00.467 --> 06:02.867
SHOULD I TOTALLY, LIKE,
TRY AND BUTCH IT UP IN SOME WAY?

06:02.900 --> 06:04.300
[HELENA]:
WHAT'S SHANE DOING?

06:04.333 --> 06:06.367
IS SHE WEARING
A TRADITIONAL TUX?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.733
NO, IT'S SHANE,

06:07.767 --> 06:09.133
SO SHE'S NOT GOING TO
DO ANYTHING TRADITIONAL.

06:09.167 --> 06:10.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:10.167 --> 06:11.433
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:11.467 --> 06:13.300
YOU SHOULD JUST DO
WHATEVER FEELS GOOD FOR YOU.

06:13.333 --> 06:14.367
TRY THIS ONE.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.467
WHAT?

06:23.500 --> 06:24.633
I DIDN'T KNOW.

06:24.667 --> 06:25.800
I DON'T KNOW.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.367
AM I REALLY
TRYING TO MARRY

06:27.400 --> 06:29.367
THE MOST
UNOBTAINABLE PERSON

06:29.400 --> 06:31.933
ON THE FACE OF THIS PLANET?

06:57.300 --> 07:00.333
IT'S OKAY.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.200
YOU WERE THINKING
ABOUT DITCHING ON ME,

07:02.233 --> 07:03.633
WEREN'T YOU?

07:05.400 --> 07:06.567
NO, I--

07:06.600 --> 07:08.800
YES, YOU WERE.
I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.267
COME ON. IT'S OKAY.

07:14.600 --> 07:18.400
SO YOU'RE A HAIRDRESSER
AT A SKATEBOARD SHOP.

07:18.433 --> 07:20.733
I MIGHT NEED AN EXPLANATION.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.333
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ONE.

07:22.367 --> 07:23.533
IT'S JUST WHAT I DO.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.400
OKAY.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.267
HAVE YOU ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO THAT?

07:30.433 --> 07:32.267
DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL FOR IT?

07:32.300 --> 07:33.900
NO.

07:33.933 --> 07:36.067
I JUST KIND OF PICKED IT UP
ALONG THE WAY.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.067
YOU'RE NOT GIVING ME
A LOT TO WORK WITH HERE.

07:41.133 --> 07:43.767
YOU DON'T LIKE
ANSWERING QUESTIONS, HUH?

07:43.800 --> 07:46.067
WELL...

07:46.100 --> 07:48.167
I DON'T EITHER.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.433
SO GO AHEAD.

07:49.467 --> 07:50.733
[DRUMS TABLE]

07:50.767 --> 07:53.233
ASK ME SOMETHING.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.800
WHY DID YOU WANT TO MEET ME?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.367
I DIDN'T.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.800
MY WIFE CARLA MADE ME.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.800
AT LEAST YOU'RE HONEST.

08:09.833 --> 08:10.900
WHEN I SAW YOU

08:10.933 --> 08:12.333
STANDING OUT THERE
ON THE STREET,

08:12.367 --> 08:16.600
WHEN I SAW YOU DECIDING
IF YOU WERE GOING TO DITCH ME...

08:16.633 --> 08:19.067
I WAS THINKING
THE EXACT SAME THING.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.567
I BET YOU WERE.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.200
KINDA LIKE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE, RIGHT?

08:30.067 --> 08:32.200
KINDA SORTA.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.467
THIS NEEDS TO BE
TAKEN IN LIKE THIS.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.633
THAT'S A LOT,
THOUGH.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.133
I DON'T LIKE IT.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.833
JENNY, WHAT DID YOU WEAR
WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED?

08:46.867 --> 08:48.133
YOU WERE MARRIED?

08:48.167 --> 08:49.333
OH, YES.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.867
I WORE A BEAUTIFUL PAIR
OF BLACK CONVERSE,

08:50.900 --> 08:52.267
WITH A GREAT PAIR

08:52.300 --> 08:53.967
OF RIPPED TIGHTS
WITH DIRT ON THEM,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.500
AND THEN I WORE
A JEAN SKIRT,

08:55.533 --> 08:56.500
AND THEN I WORE

08:56.533 --> 08:57.800
THIS BEAUTIFUL OLD,

08:57.833 --> 09:01.133
RIPPED, STAINED
PINK SWEATSHIRT.

09:01.167 --> 09:02.467
IT WAS AWESOME.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.633
NOT EXACTLY
THE WEDDING DRESS

09:03.667 --> 09:05.400
OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
DREAMS.

09:05.433 --> 09:08.400
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE
THAT CHILDHOOD THING

09:08.433 --> 09:10.267
OF GETTING MARRIED,

09:10.300 --> 09:12.533
YOU KNOW, THAT ALL LITTLE GIRLS
ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE,

09:12.567 --> 09:14.067
THAT KIND OF DREAM.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.067
NOT LITTLE GAY GIRLS.

09:15.100 --> 09:16.500
OH, WOW.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.333
I THINK THIS HAS "JENNY"
WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

09:18.367 --> 09:19.633
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.367
LOOK AT THE BEADS.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.600
WHEN TINA AND I

09:22.633 --> 09:24.067
WERE TALKING
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED,

09:24.067 --> 09:25.367
WE WERE BOTH GOING TO WEAR
FABULOUS DRESSES.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.967
HOW COME YOU GUYS
DIDN'T GET MARRIED?

09:28.067 --> 09:30.367
TINA THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
TOO CONVENTIONAL.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.067
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO CLEAVE
TO THE HETEROSEXUAL PARADIGM.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.400
NOW IT'S CLEAVING
ALL OVER HER.

09:35.433 --> 09:36.567
COME BACK
TO US, TINA.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.767
COME BACK
ON OUR SIDE.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.200
FUCK THAT. THEY CAN HAVE HER.

09:40.233 --> 09:41.567
I THINK YOU WOULD
LOOK BEAUTIFUL

09:41.600 --> 09:44.100
IN YOUR
WEDDING DRESS.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.833
GO ON, BETTE.

09:45.867 --> 09:47.700
TRY IT ON.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.467
NO...THANKS.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.633
I MEAN, I KNEW
I WAS GAY

09:52.667 --> 09:54.333
SINCE I WAS 12,
BUT...

09:54.367 --> 09:55.900
I DON'T KNOW,
I ALWAYS JUST KIND OF DREAMED

09:55.933 --> 09:58.200
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

09:58.233 --> 09:59.767
I WAS THE ASSISTANT
FOREMAN

09:59.800 --> 10:01.300
AT THE PULP MILL

10:01.333 --> 10:02.500
TILL I HURT MY BACK.

10:02.533 --> 10:03.633
NOW I DRIVE A TRUCK

10:03.667 --> 10:05.100
FOR A BEVERAGE
DISTRIBUTOR.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.800
HOW'D YOU HURT
YOUR BACK?

10:06.833 --> 10:07.967
THANK YOU.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.100
WE HAVE THESE
LONG BACKS,

10:09.133 --> 10:10.600
YOU KNOW?

10:10.633 --> 10:14.900
AND WE TEND TO HUNCH FORWARD
AND SLOUCH OUR SHOULDERS.

10:14.933 --> 10:16.467
YOU ALWAYS DID IT
AS A KID.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.200
I USED TO COME
WATCH YOU.

10:19.233 --> 10:20.967
I'D SEE YOU ON THE PLAYGROUND
AT THE CHURCH SCHOOL.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.867
AND YOU ALWAYS LOOKED...

10:24.900 --> 10:27.767
SO PISSED OFF.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.067
YOU NEVER TALKED TO ME.

10:31.867 --> 10:34.133
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MUCH GOOD TO YOU BACK THEN.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.367
ALL I CARED ABOUT
WAS GETTING HIGH,

10:36.400 --> 10:40.233
GETTING LAID...

10:40.267 --> 10:42.133
I'D PROBABLY STILL BE DOING IT

10:42.167 --> 10:44.767
IF MY FRIEND CHUCK
HADN'T O.D.'d.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.567
I'M SORRY.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.067
AS STRUNG OUT AS I WAS,

10:51.100 --> 10:54.033
IT REALLY SHAKES YOU HARD
WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE

10:54.067 --> 10:56.433
THAT YOU'RE
REALLY CLOSE TO.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.400
YEAH.

11:03.067 --> 11:05.167
I...

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
I JUST LOST
A REALLY CLOSE FRIEND RECENTLY,

11:09.400 --> 11:10.500
SO...

11:12.400 --> 11:14.067
YEAH.

11:20.133 --> 11:23.500
SO...

11:25.800 --> 11:27.067
WHY DON'T YOU
COME HOME WITH ME

11:27.100 --> 11:29.333
FOR DINNER.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.900
IT'D BE A GOOD TIME
TO MEET CARLA AND SHAY.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.067
SHAY?

11:32.067 --> 11:34.067
WE ALMOST CALLED HIM SHANE,

11:34.100 --> 11:37.067
BECAUSE I LOVE THE NAME
SO MUCH.

11:44.833 --> 11:46.333
I NAMED YOU THAT, YOU KNOW.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.300
SHE'S BEEN WITH TINA
AT HENRY'S

11:53.333 --> 11:54.633
FOR THE LAST TWO NIGHTS.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.967
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I SHOULD HAVE TO SHARE MY TIME.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.300
BECAUSE IT WOULD
LOOK BAD IN COURT

11:57.333 --> 11:58.633
IF TINA TELLS THE JUDGE

11:58.667 --> 12:01.133
THAT YOU REFUSED TO FLY
ON THE SAME PLANE WITH HER.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.700
HER BOYFRIEND
IS COMING UP ON THE WEEKEND.

12:02.733 --> 12:04.133
WHY CAN'T SHE JUST WAIT
AND GO UP WITH HIM?

12:04.167 --> 12:05.700
LOOK, JOYCE,

12:05.733 --> 12:07.100
I CAN'T BE IN CLOSE QUARTERS
WITH HER.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.233
I JUST CAN'T.

12:08.267 --> 12:10.900
JUST BE GENIAL AND CIVIL, OKAY?

12:10.933 --> 12:12.967
JUST DO IT
FOR YOUR KID,

12:13.067 --> 12:14.100
BUT WHATEVER
YOU DO, BETTE,

12:14.133 --> 12:15.233
PLEASE...

12:15.267 --> 12:18.333
DON'T CAUSE A SCENE.

12:18.367 --> 12:21.067
WELL, WHAT IF SHE BRINGS UP
THE CUSTODY PLAN?

12:21.067 --> 12:23.167
YOU DON'T TELL HER

12:23.200 --> 12:24.433
THAT WE'RE GOING
FOR SOLE CUSTODY.

12:24.467 --> 12:25.500
WE DON'T WANT HER
TO KNOW ABOUT THAT

12:25.533 --> 12:26.833
UNTIL WE FILE OUR BRIEF.

12:26.867 --> 12:27.900
I KNOW.

12:27.933 --> 12:29.133
OKAY?

12:29.167 --> 12:30.467
YEAH.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.133
I THINK
I'M GOING TO TAKE THAT JOB.

12:35.167 --> 12:36.533
EXCELLENT.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.967
THAT WILL PLAY
VERY WELL IN COURT.

12:39.067 --> 12:42.533
DEAN OF A PRESTIGIOUS
ART SCHOOL?

12:42.567 --> 12:44.167
AND IT CAN'T HURT

12:44.200 --> 12:46.367
WHEN IT COMES
TO PULLING IN CHICKS.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.433
EXCUSE ME?

12:47.467 --> 12:49.367
LOTS OF PRETTY,
YOUNG ART STUDENTS.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.300
YOU'LL BE LIKE A KID
IN A CANDY STORE.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.300
GOD, JOYCE.

12:52.333 --> 12:53.667
THAT'S COMPLETELY
UNETHICAL.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.067
I WOULD NEVER DO
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

12:57.533 --> 12:58.800
OH, I...
EXCUSE ME.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.133
I AM SO SORRY,
COUNSELOR.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.600
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
RIGHT AWAY.

13:01.633 --> 13:03.233
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:03.267 --> 13:04.367
I'VE GOT TO
TALK TO YOU.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.733
EXCUSE ME.

13:07.067 --> 13:10.433
WHY DID WE GO
IN THE BATHROOM?

13:10.467 --> 13:11.867
WHAT'S THAT?

13:11.900 --> 13:13.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:16.067 --> 13:18.067
IT LOOKS LIKE
A HOME PREGNANCY TEST.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.633
OH, COME ON.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.867
KIT, YOU'RE
IN MENOPAUSE.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.200
YOU CAN'T BE
PREGNANT.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.967
WHO SAYS, HUH?

13:27.067 --> 13:28.333
IT'S THE HOME TEST.

13:28.367 --> 13:30.300
I MEAN, THEY'RE
TOTALLY UNRELIABLE.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.567
YOU HAVE TO DO
MORE THAN ONE.

13:31.600 --> 13:32.667
YOU CAN'T DO--

13:34.667 --> 13:37.733
[LAUGHS]

13:37.767 --> 13:39.267
FUCK.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.633
MY QUANTUM PHOTON CHIP

13:40.667 --> 13:42.100
IS GOING TO BLOW
EVERYTHING ELSE

13:42.133 --> 13:43.300
OUT OF THE WATER.

13:43.333 --> 13:44.800
THE METHODWARE'S
TOTALLY BECOMING

13:44.833 --> 13:46.433
A REGULAR FEATURE
OF MY TOOLKIT.

13:46.467 --> 13:48.067
I WANT TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM

13:48.100 --> 13:49.633
THAT NAVIGATES DOCUMENTATION

13:49.667 --> 13:51.867
FOR I.T. PROCESS
BEST PRACTICES.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.433
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU THINK, MAX.

13:53.467 --> 13:54.767
ORIGINAL THINKERS

13:54.800 --> 13:56.433
ARE OUR MOST VALUABLE PIECES
OF MANPOWER.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.367
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
REALLY INTERESTED

13:58.400 --> 13:59.667
IN TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.967
[WOMAN]:
COME TALK TO ME, MAX.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.300
I ALREADY HAVE
THE MARKETECTURE.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.833
JENNY, MY WIFE
GLAZES OVER TOO

14:04.867 --> 14:06.167
WHEN I GET GOING
ON THIS STUFF.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.300
OH, I'M SORRY.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.833
DO I APPEAR
A LITTLE SPACED OUT?

14:09.867 --> 14:10.833
I THINK
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF THINGS

14:10.867 --> 14:11.967
WHEN I'M OUT WITH THESE GUYS--

14:12.067 --> 14:13.267
I THINK
ABOUT MY PEDICURE,

14:13.300 --> 14:14.633
MY KID'S HOMEWORK,

14:14.667 --> 14:16.700
MY CHARITY AUCTION...

14:16.733 --> 14:18.467
I'M THINKING ABOUT

14:18.500 --> 14:20.500
THIS STORY
THAT I'M WORKING ON

14:20.533 --> 14:22.333
ABOUT HOW
WHEN I WAS 12,

14:22.367 --> 14:25.600
I USED TO MASTURBATE
LIKE 20 TIMES A DAY,

14:25.633 --> 14:26.967
AND I'M NOT SURE

14:27.067 --> 14:29.167
WHETHER I SHOULD
MAKE IT, LIKE, FICTION

14:29.200 --> 14:32.067
OR A NEW YORKER STYLE
ESSAY PIECE.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.700
I DON'T KNOW.

14:34.733 --> 14:37.867
I DON'T KNOW.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.133
DINNER WAS
PHENOMENAL.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.133
THANK YOU.

14:40.167 --> 14:41.300
IT WAS OKAY.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.433
IT WAS GREAT.

14:45.800 --> 14:46.867
SCORE!

14:46.900 --> 14:47.833
NICE SHOT.
YOU GOT PAST MY GOAL.

14:47.867 --> 14:50.067
GOOD JOB.
THERE YOU GO.

14:50.100 --> 14:51.933
I KNEW YOU WERE HIS DAUGHTER,

14:51.967 --> 14:54.600
AND IT WASN'T JUST
BECAUSE OF THE NAME.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.767
IT WAS THE PICTURE.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.867
YOU HAVE HIS GENES.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.167
HE HAS
VERY STRONG GENES.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.267
I MEAN,
LOOK AT ALL THREE OF YOU.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.200
HEY, SHAY...

15:05.233 --> 15:09.067
SHANE HAS A SKATEBOARD SHOP.

15:09.067 --> 15:10.067
MM-HMM.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.567
YOU SKATEBOARD?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.833
I DO.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.133
WE EVEN HAVE A HALF-PIPE
AT THE STORE.

15:15.167 --> 15:17.200
COOL!

15:17.233 --> 15:19.067
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
DOING REAL WELL THERE.

15:19.100 --> 15:22.167
I MEAN, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN LINE
OF HAIR PRODUCTS AND EVERYTHING.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.300
"SHANE FOR WAX."

15:23.333 --> 15:24.333
I LOVE THAT.

15:24.367 --> 15:25.600
OH, THANK YOU.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.067
THAT WAS
MY PARTNER CHASE'S IDEA.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.800
OH, IS HE THE BOY
WITH THE MOHAWK?

15:29.833 --> 15:31.300
YEAH, THAT'S HIM,
IN THE PICTURE.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.567
YEAH.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.167
ARE YOU TWO--

15:34.200 --> 15:35.500
OH, NO, NO.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.900
OH...

15:40.400 --> 15:41.900
COME ON.

15:41.933 --> 15:42.967
FINISH YOUR DINNER,

15:43.067 --> 15:44.700
OR I'LL TAKE THE GAME
OFF THE TABLE.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.067
I'M ACTUALLY
GETTING MARRIED NEXT WEEK.

15:52.067 --> 15:53.400
WOW!

15:53.433 --> 15:54.567
WOW. THAT'S WONDERFUL.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.767
GABE!

15:55.800 --> 15:57.433
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

15:57.467 --> 15:58.767
WOW.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.733
WHO KNEW?

16:00.767 --> 16:02.100
NOT ME.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.500
[CARLA]: WELL, I MEAN,

16:03.533 --> 16:04.700
JUST BECAUSE
IT TOOK YOU 45 YEARS

16:04.733 --> 16:07.067
TO SETTLE DOWN, GABE...

16:07.067 --> 16:08.467
EVERYWHERE WE WENT,

16:08.500 --> 16:11.233
WOMEN JUST THREW
THEMSELVES AT HIM.

16:11.267 --> 16:13.167
HE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.933
NOBODY EVER THOUGHT
HE'D SETTLE DOWN.

16:15.967 --> 16:18.067
AND LOOK AT ME NOW.

16:19.267 --> 16:21.133
WELL, IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.300
IT'S GREAT.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.900
SO, WHAT'S HE DO, YOUR GUY?

16:31.267 --> 16:33.367
SHE'S A D.J.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.200
HER NAME'S CARMEN.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.967
WELL, SEE, I TOLD YOU.

16:45.067 --> 16:48.067
I LOOKED AT YOUR PICTURE
AND I SAID, "I BET SHE'S GAY."

16:49.333 --> 16:50.867
[GABE]: SHE DID.
SHE NAILED THAT.

16:50.900 --> 16:52.267
YEAH.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.600
[SHAY]: YES!

16:54.633 --> 16:56.067
AH, YOU WON!

16:56.100 --> 16:59.467
MY DAD ALWAYS
LETS ME WIN.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.233
SO, WHERE ARE YOU
GETTING MARRIED?

17:04.267 --> 17:05.233
IN WHISTLER.

17:05.267 --> 17:06.600
CANADA.
YEAH.

17:06.633 --> 17:08.067
YOU CAN DO THAT
THERE, YEAH?

17:08.067 --> 17:09.867
YES, YOU CAN.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.867
JUST... YEAH.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.633
HEY, WE SHOULD GO.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.067
I MEAN, IT'S SO CLOSE. WE...

17:16.067 --> 17:17.433
HONEY, SLOW DOWN.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.700
WE HAVEN'T EXACTLY BEEN INVITED.

17:24.067 --> 17:25.567
NO, YOU'RE INVITED.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.900
I'D LIKE FOR YOU GUYS
TO BE THERE.

17:31.933 --> 17:33.333
IF...

17:33.367 --> 17:34.367
IF, YOU KNOW...

17:34.400 --> 17:35.833
IF YOU WOULD LIKE.

17:44.700 --> 17:47.867
I WANT TO BELIEVE, MY FRIENDS.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.867
BELIEVE ME, I DO.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.100
BECAUSE MY FRIEND SHANE

17:52.133 --> 17:54.333
IS GETTING MARRIED
THIS WEEKEND...

17:54.367 --> 17:56.733
AND I WANT TO BELIEVE FOR SHANE,

17:56.767 --> 17:59.433
AND I WANT TO BELIEVE
FOR ALL OF THE REST OF US

17:59.467 --> 18:02.067
WHO ARE FLAILING AROUND
IN THIS ABYSS,

18:02.067 --> 18:04.567
TRYING TO FEEL
WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FEEL

18:04.600 --> 18:07.500
IN ORDER TO CONNECT
IN MEANINGFUL WAYS...

18:07.533 --> 18:09.267
I WANT TO BELIEVE

18:09.300 --> 18:11.467
THAT REAL, TRUE CONNECTION
AMONG HUMAN BEINGS

18:11.500 --> 18:13.900
IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE...

18:13.933 --> 18:17.333
AND SUPPOSEDLY,
MARRIAGE CONNECTS US.

18:17.367 --> 18:22.067
I MEAN, SUPPOSEDLY IT IMPROVES
OUR MORAL FIBER AND ALL,

18:22.067 --> 18:24.433
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION--

18:24.467 --> 18:28.567
WHY DO THESE CRAZY, CREEPY,
DEFENDING-THE-FAMILY CRUSADERS

18:28.600 --> 18:30.333
THINK IT'S A BAD THING
FOR GAYS?

18:30.367 --> 18:33.267
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T THEY
JUST WISH US WELL?

18:33.300 --> 18:34.900
HYPOCRITES.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.267
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING
TO CANADA, PEOPLE,

18:43.300 --> 18:46.067
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

18:46.100 --> 18:48.400
TO TAKE OUR BEST SHOT
AT THIS CONNECTION,

18:48.433 --> 18:50.067
AND IF WE FAIL,

18:50.067 --> 18:51.433
IT IS NOT BECAUSE
WE ARE LESS WHOLESOME

18:51.467 --> 18:52.800
THAN YOU ARE.

18:52.833 --> 18:54.500
PLEASE.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.133
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN
FAILING AT THIS MISERABLY

18:56.167 --> 18:58.367
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF RECORDED HISTORY.

18:58.400 --> 19:01.100
AND IF WE SUCCEED

19:01.133 --> 19:04.767
AND OUR LOVE CONNECTIONS
ACTUALLY FLOURISH,

19:04.800 --> 19:08.567
AND THERE'S A LITTLE LESS
LONELINESS IN THE WORLD,

19:08.600 --> 19:11.400
THEN EVEN I MIGHT START
BELIEVING IN MIRACLES.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.500
WELCOME TO THE FAIRMONT
CHATEAU WHISTLER.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.967
IT'S FREEZING...

19:21.067 --> 19:22.333
HI.

19:22.367 --> 19:23.767
HELLO.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.467
[SHANE]: WOW,
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.067
HERE COMES THE BRIDE.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.700
LOOK AT THIS!

19:35.733 --> 19:37.133
THIS IS AMAZING!

19:37.167 --> 19:38.133
IT'S SO NICE

19:38.167 --> 19:39.967
YOU'RE HERE FOR
THE WEDDING, PEGGY.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.633
[SPEAKING
SPANISH]

20:00.000 --> 20:01.967
THEY'RE ALL DRESSED
IN THE SAME CLOTHES.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
SHE DIDN'T THINK THEY
WERE COMING, THOUGH.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.133
[ALICE]: I THINK
HELENA MIGHT HAVE HAD

20:07.167 --> 20:08.333
SOMETHING
TO DO WITH IT.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.967
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

20:25.200 --> 20:26.767
I COULDN'T MISS IT.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.367
MY BABY'S GETTING MARRIED.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.800
EVERYBODY,

20:31.833 --> 20:32.833
THIS IS CARMEN'S
FRIEND, HELENA.

20:32.867 --> 20:34.000
SHE'S THE ONE

20:34.033 --> 20:36.500
THAT PHONED ME
AND INVITED US ALL

20:36.533 --> 20:38.000
AND PAID FOR
OUR PLANE TICKETS

20:38.033 --> 20:39.500
AND OUR HOTEL ROOMS.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.667
THANK YOU, HELENA.

20:42.700 --> 20:43.700
MY PLEASURE.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.033
OH, WOW.

20:47.067 --> 20:48.500
YOU HAVE A BIG FAMILY.

20:48.533 --> 20:49.767
I KNOW.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.700
I GUESS
IT GROWS ON TREES.

20:59.833 --> 21:01.567
ANNA SAYS
YOU BOUGHT A DRESS.

21:01.600 --> 21:02.533
MM-HMM.

21:02.567 --> 21:03.767
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

21:03.800 --> 21:05.133
I NEED TO CHECK IT.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.633
I WANT TO MAKE SURE

21:06.667 --> 21:09.600
THE JEWELRY
GOES WITH IT.

21:09.633 --> 21:13.200
AND LOOK, WE HAVE EVI
TO DO YOUR HAIR.

21:13.233 --> 21:15.500
OH, AND JANE...

21:15.533 --> 21:17.067
JANE...

21:17.067 --> 21:20.400
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
SUCH A HANDSOME BRIDE...

21:20.433 --> 21:21.567
GROOM.

21:21.600 --> 21:22.967
THANK YOU.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.533
SO HANDSOME.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.100
CARMENCITA...

21:26.133 --> 21:27.133
YES.

21:27.167 --> 21:28.667
YOU ARE COMING
WITH US.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.067
WE ARE GOING SIGHTSEEING
AT THE WHISTLER VILLAGE.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.300
NOT ALLOWED
TO SEE HER NOW

21:33.333 --> 21:34.300
TILL THE WEDDING.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.400
OKAY.
OKAY?

21:35.433 --> 21:36.400
BYE.

21:36.433 --> 21:37.900
COME ON.

21:37.933 --> 21:38.967
BYE.

21:39.067 --> 21:40.200
BYE.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.133
HEY, BABY.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.367
SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME UP?

21:51.400 --> 21:53.667
IT'S REALLY FUN.

21:53.700 --> 21:54.767
ALL RIGHT.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.400
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.267
DO YOU HATE
SKIING ALSO?

22:05.067 --> 22:07.300
I JUST HATE ALL THE BULLSHIT
THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

22:07.333 --> 22:09.200
WITH ALL THE EQUIPMENT.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.767
ME TOO.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.067
I DON'T DO ANY
LEISURE ACTIVITIES

22:15.100 --> 22:16.867
THAT REQUIRE ME TO USE

22:16.900 --> 22:19.133
MORE THAN ONE PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT.

22:21.667 --> 22:24.500
EXCEPT SEX.

22:24.533 --> 22:27.833
SEX ISN'T A LEISURE ACTIVITY.

22:29.400 --> 22:32.267
WHAT IS SEX, THEN?

22:32.300 --> 22:35.967
SOMETIMES
IT'S A REVELATION...

22:36.067 --> 22:38.833
SOMETIMES IT'S FUN...

22:38.867 --> 22:43.100
SOMETIMES IT'S SCARY...

22:43.133 --> 22:46.333
SOMETIMES IT'S TEPID.

22:46.367 --> 22:49.067
WHICH IS IT WITH YOUR FRIEND?

22:49.100 --> 22:50.967
I'M INTERESTED.

22:51.067 --> 22:54.467
I'VE NEVER BEEN
WITH A TRANSSEXUAL.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.433
THAT'S A PERSONAL QUESTION.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.867
I ONLY ASK QUESTIONS
THAT ARE PERSONAL.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.067
QUESTIONS
THAT ARE NOT

23:04.100 --> 23:07.067
CAN BE ANSWERED
BY A TEXTBOOK.

23:07.067 --> 23:10.500
BESIDES, I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE.

23:10.533 --> 23:13.333
ABOUT SEX WITH A TRANSSEXUAL?

23:13.367 --> 23:15.900
UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

23:15.933 --> 23:20.633
JUST A VERY SILLY ARTICLE
FOR A VERY SILLY MAGAZINE.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.733
GAY TRAVEL DESTINATIONS.

23:28.767 --> 23:29.900
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW

23:29.933 --> 23:33.467
WHAT IT'S LIKE HERE FOR YOU,
AND, UH...

23:33.500 --> 23:35.367
MAX.

23:38.833 --> 23:41.233
WHY IS YOUR ARTICLE SILLY?

23:41.267 --> 23:43.467
BECAUSE I THINK
EVERY PLACE

23:43.500 --> 23:46.433
SHOULD BE
A GAY TRAVEL DESTINATION.

23:46.467 --> 23:50.867
WE LIMIT OURSELVES
WITH THESE STUPID...

23:50.900 --> 23:53.067
LABELS.

23:53.067 --> 23:56.667
LABELS.

24:10.067 --> 24:11.833
AUGUST WILSON
WASN'T ASHAMED

24:11.867 --> 24:14.200
OF BEING
A BLACK WRITER.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.067
HIS ENTIRE OEUVRE

24:18.067 --> 24:19.767
WAS THE BLACK
EXPERIENCE,

24:19.800 --> 24:24.100
AND HE NEVER
APOLOGIZED FOR IT.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.800
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LABELED AS A GAY WRITER.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.400
WHY?

24:28.433 --> 24:30.167
WHY?

24:30.200 --> 24:31.467
WHAT ARE YOU
AFRAID OF?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.300
CE N'EST PAS JUSTE.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.233
POURQUOI
CE N'EST PAS JUSTE?

24:35.267 --> 24:37.233
PARCE QUE...

24:37.267 --> 24:38.500
BECAUSE YOU SAID

24:38.533 --> 24:41.267
THAT YOU DIDN'T
LIKE LABELS.

24:56.633 --> 24:58.267
CAN YOU HANDLE IT?

24:58.300 --> 25:00.833
LICK IT UP,
LIKE A CAT.

25:13.967 --> 25:15.633
[TINA]:
THANK YOU, BUSTER THE HORSE.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.267
THANK YOU, BABY,
TO THE HORSE...

25:18.300 --> 25:20.067
WE'RE ALMOST BACK.

25:20.100 --> 25:21.233
WHAT'S HE
GOING TO SAY?

25:21.267 --> 25:22.967
WHAT'S HE
GOING TO SAY?

25:23.067 --> 25:24.433
HOW DO YOU MAKE
THE HORSES STOP?

25:24.467 --> 25:25.133
YOU SAY...

25:25.167 --> 25:26.233
WHOA. WHOA.

25:26.267 --> 25:28.400
WHOA!
WHOA!

25:30.467 --> 25:32.333
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.

25:32.367 --> 25:33.400
DID YOU SEE HER FACE?

25:33.433 --> 25:34.667
I KNOW. I KNOW.
SO SWEET.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.333
THAT WAS
ALMOST AS GOOD

25:36.367 --> 25:38.300
AS HER FIRST STEP.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.800
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

25:44.700 --> 25:45.667
YOU WERE
ON YOUR RETREAT.

25:45.700 --> 25:46.667
I TRIED TO CALL YOU.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.667
ANYWAY, I THINK
IT WAS GOOD

25:47.700 --> 25:49.333
THAT WE WERE
BOTH HERE TO SEE IT.

25:51.900 --> 25:55.600
YEAH, I'M GLAD
I WAS HERE.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.067
SO, SHANE, WHERE IS
YOUR LOVELY BRIDE?

26:00.067 --> 26:01.400
PEGGY, THIS IS SHANE'S
BACHELOR PARTY.

26:01.433 --> 26:03.700
BRIDES ARE EXCLUDED.

26:03.733 --> 26:04.900
OH, MY GOODNESS.

26:04.933 --> 26:06.067
I HAD NO IDEA

26:06.067 --> 26:08.200
YOU WERE SUCH
ROLE-PLAYING LESBIANS.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.367
[SHANE]:
COME ON, WE'RE NOT.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.300
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

26:10.333 --> 26:11.733
I'D LIKE FOR HER
TO BE HERE

26:11.767 --> 26:12.867
BUT HER FAMILY'S
SO TRADITIONAL,

26:12.900 --> 26:14.500
SO I STEPPED BACK.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.700
I THINK THAT'S NICE.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.567
I THINK THAT'S REGRESSIVE.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.500
[HELENA]: WELL...

26:20.533 --> 26:22.067
WE'RE PRETTY TRADITIONAL
IN OUR FAMILY, TOO,

26:22.100 --> 26:23.367
AREN'T WE, MOMMY?

26:23.400 --> 26:25.333
OH, LOOK,

26:25.367 --> 26:27.533
BETTE AND TINA
ARE HERE NOW.

26:27.567 --> 26:28.633
TIME FOR DINNER.

26:28.667 --> 26:29.733
PLEASE, TAKE MY HAND...

26:29.767 --> 26:31.467
AND LET ME BURY MY HEAD

26:31.500 --> 26:32.733
IN YOUR AMPLE BOSOM

26:32.767 --> 26:34.867
IF I GET A LITTLE
TOO EMOTIONAL.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.667
MMM.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.067
YOU GOT QUITE
AN APPETITE THERE, GIRL.

26:43.067 --> 26:45.567
BETTER SAVE SOME ROOM
FOR THE FONDUE.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.967
I'M PREGNANT.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.500
[LAUGHS]

26:55.800 --> 26:56.967
NO FUCKING WAY.

26:57.067 --> 26:58.067
NO--

26:58.100 --> 26:59.267
DON'T DO THAT-- STOP IT.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.133
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

27:01.167 --> 27:03.500
THAT WAS COMPLETELY STUPID.

27:03.533 --> 27:05.067
YEAH. YEAH.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.933
OKAY, OKAY. UM...

27:07.967 --> 27:10.067
LET ME
TRY THIS AGAIN.

27:10.067 --> 27:12.733
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE PLANNING,

27:12.767 --> 27:14.667
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY
YOUR DECISION,

27:14.700 --> 27:16.267
COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY.

27:16.300 --> 27:17.467
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.467
YEAH, OKAY,

27:18.500 --> 27:19.667
BUT I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

27:19.700 --> 27:21.267
THAT I'M WITH YOU.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.733
I'LL SUPPORT YOU

27:22.767 --> 27:24.667
IN WHATEVER DECISION
YOU MAKE.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.500
SPECIFICALLY, I'LL...

27:26.533 --> 27:28.200
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE DOCTOR,

27:28.233 --> 27:31.767
AND I'LL HOLD YOUR HAND
DURING THE...

27:31.800 --> 27:33.467
PROCEDURE...

27:33.500 --> 27:35.167
AND I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME,

27:35.200 --> 27:37.500
AND PUT YOU TO BED
WITH A HOT WATER BOTTLE,

27:37.533 --> 27:41.533
OR, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DECIDE TO...

27:41.567 --> 27:43.900
GO THROUGH WITH IT,
I'LL...

27:45.667 --> 27:47.300
I'LL BE YOUR BRADLEY COACH

27:47.333 --> 27:49.733
AND I'LL BUST MY ASS
TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY

27:49.767 --> 27:51.567
TO PUT OUR KID THROUGH COLLEGE.

27:58.167 --> 27:59.300
[GLASS CLINKING]

27:59.333 --> 28:00.567
[JENNY]:
OKAY, EVERYBODY,

28:00.600 --> 28:02.900
WE WOULD LIKE
TO MAKE A TOAST

28:02.933 --> 28:05.267
TO OUR DEAR FRIEND
SHANE.

28:05.300 --> 28:06.700
YES, SHANE.

28:06.733 --> 28:08.733
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT TOGETHER

28:08.767 --> 28:10.167
AS FRIENDS,

28:10.200 --> 28:12.567
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST
FEW MONTHS.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.333
SHANE, THE THING
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT US

28:14.367 --> 28:15.733
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP

28:15.767 --> 28:17.700
IS ABOUT BEING FEARLESS,

28:17.733 --> 28:19.400
SO THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, SHANE,

28:19.433 --> 28:23.100
FOR CONVINCING ME
TO CUT OFF MY LUSTROUS,

28:23.133 --> 28:26.067
MINK-LIKE,
LONG, LONG MANE

28:26.067 --> 28:27.867
AS SHORT AS
HUMANLY POSSIBLE,

28:27.900 --> 28:29.100
AND SHANE...

28:29.133 --> 28:30.400
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

28:30.433 --> 28:31.867
FOR NOT MAKING IT
LOOK LIKE YOURS.

28:31.900 --> 28:35.367
[LAUGHING]

28:37.367 --> 28:38.467
IT'S REALLY
GROWN BACK FAST.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.567
YES, IT HAS.

28:39.600 --> 28:42.900
AND SHANE,
THANK YOU, AS A FRIEND,

28:42.933 --> 28:45.600
FOR SAVING ME FROM GOING HOME
WITH THAT GIRL THAT NIGHT--

28:45.633 --> 28:47.067
YOU KNOW THE ONE
I'M TALKING ABOUT--

28:47.067 --> 28:48.467
AND, AS A FRIEND,

28:48.500 --> 28:50.267
TAKING HER HOME YOURSELF
INSTEAD.

28:50.300 --> 28:52.167
THANK YOU.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.067
SHANE, ONLY YOU

28:54.067 --> 28:57.800
COULD MAKE A TWO-PIECE
PLEATHERETTE ENSEMBLE

28:57.833 --> 28:59.167
LOOK GOOD...

28:59.200 --> 29:00.800
AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.

29:00.833 --> 29:01.867
DRUNK...

29:01.900 --> 29:03.533
AFTER A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

29:05.433 --> 29:08.733
BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS,
YOU ARE OUR BEST FRIEND.

29:08.767 --> 29:11.767
SHANE, YOU'RE
THE MOST LOYAL FRIEND

29:11.800 --> 29:13.433
I--

29:13.467 --> 29:15.700
AND I THINK I CAN
SPEAK FOR THE GROUP--

29:15.733 --> 29:17.067
THAT WE HAVE EVER MET,

29:17.067 --> 29:20.167
AND YOU'VE NEVER
LEFT OUR SIDES

29:20.200 --> 29:23.367
WHEN THINGS HAVE
BECOME DARK,

29:23.400 --> 29:24.800
AND I THINK

29:24.833 --> 29:26.333
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT
THE WHOLE GROUP

29:26.367 --> 29:28.467
THAT PEOPLE'S
ROUGH EDGES

29:28.500 --> 29:30.067
ARE BEAUTIFUL.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.833
[ALICE]:
AND WE KNOW THAT...

29:31.867 --> 29:33.867
IF DANA WAS HERE,

29:33.900 --> 29:35.400
THAT SHE WOULD BE
VERY HAPPY TO KNOW

29:35.433 --> 29:38.400
THAT YOU WERE MARRYING
SOMEONE YOU LOVE.

29:38.433 --> 29:41.633
SO WE LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH,

29:41.667 --> 29:43.133
AND CONGRATULATIONS.

29:44.967 --> 29:45.967
TO SHANE!
TO SHANE!

29:46.067 --> 29:47.067
TO SHANE!

29:47.067 --> 29:48.467
ALL THE BEST.
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:48.500 --> 29:51.467
CONGRATULATIONS.
CONGRATS.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.733
[PEGGY]:
SO, MY DEAR SHANE--

29:52.767 --> 29:53.933
ALTHOUGH I DON'T
UNDERSTAND

29:53.967 --> 29:55.633
WHY YOU WOULD EMBRACE
AN INSTITUTION

29:55.667 --> 29:57.067
THAT BREEDS CONFORMITY

29:57.067 --> 29:58.567
AND RESTRICTS
FREE WILL--

29:58.600 --> 29:59.767
THAT SAID,

29:59.800 --> 30:01.633
IF YOU GIVE ONE ANOTHER
CHILDREN,

30:01.667 --> 30:03.200
I ONLY HOPE

30:03.233 --> 30:08.167
THAT THEY'RE AS GENEROUS
AND KIND AND LOVELY

30:08.200 --> 30:09.433
AS THE ONE

30:09.467 --> 30:12.467
MY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING BRIT
GAVE ME.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.700
[ANGUS]:
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

30:13.733 --> 30:15.633
ARE YOU GUYS
GOING TO HAVE KIDS?

30:18.467 --> 30:20.467
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT IT UP.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.133
[ALICE]: YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO HAVE KIDS.

30:23.167 --> 30:24.967
YOU DON'T WANT 'EM,
DO YOU?

30:25.000 --> 30:27.900
UH...

30:27.933 --> 30:29.133
YEAH, I THINK I DO.

30:29.167 --> 30:30.467
YOU DO?

30:30.500 --> 30:32.200
YEAH.

30:32.233 --> 30:34.433
I THINK YOU'D BE
A WONDERFUL PARENT.

30:37.167 --> 30:39.600
YEAH, CARMEN WOULD BE
REALLY BEAUTIFUL PREGNANT.

30:39.633 --> 30:40.800
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK

30:40.833 --> 30:43.167
THAT SHANE WOULDN'T
CARRY THE BABY?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.200
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.467
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

30:45.500 --> 30:46.733
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D GO THAT FAR,

30:46.767 --> 30:48.200
BUT I THINK THAT...

30:48.233 --> 30:49.600
IN ANY EVENT,

30:49.633 --> 30:52.867
I THINK KIDS ARE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL GIFT,

30:52.900 --> 30:54.233
BECAUSE...

30:54.267 --> 30:55.533
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

30:55.567 --> 30:57.467
I MEAN,
I LOOK AT THAT LITTLE ONE,

30:57.500 --> 30:58.733
AND I SEE THE LOVE
THAT YOU HAVE FOR HER,

30:58.767 --> 30:59.900
AND THE LOVE

31:00.067 --> 31:02.100
THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
FOR EACH OTHER,

31:02.133 --> 31:04.500
DESPITE THE THINGS
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

31:04.533 --> 31:05.967
AND...

31:06.067 --> 31:08.167
I DON'T KNOW,
IT JUST SEEMS THAT...

31:08.200 --> 31:10.633
SOMETIMES LOVE
JUST DOESN'T LAST

31:10.667 --> 31:12.533
THE WAY YOU HOPE
IT WILL,

31:12.567 --> 31:14.500
BUT IF YOU GET
THROUGH THAT PAIN,

31:14.533 --> 31:16.200
IT JUST...

31:16.233 --> 31:18.533
IT COULD LAST IN WAYS
THAT ARE MORE PRECIOUS...

31:18.567 --> 31:19.867
MAYBE...

31:19.900 --> 31:22.067
POSSIBLY.

31:22.067 --> 31:23.300
WOW.

31:23.333 --> 31:24.467

34:16.267 --> 34:18.200
THAT'S WHAT I HOPE FOR US,
BETTE.

WE'RE A FAMILY,

34:20.833 --> 34:23.500

FAMILY THINGS TOGETHER.

I THINK THAT'S WHAT
WOULD BE BEST

34:24.933 --> 34:27.567
FOR ANGELICA...

34:27.600 --> 34:30.333

35:23.067 --> 35:26.367
THAT I WANT TO GO

35:26.400 --> 35:27.767
I DON'T THINK

35:27.800 --> 35:31.767

YOU CAN'T COME IN.

37:00.500 --> 37:01.467

37:01.500 --> 37:02.467

40:04.933 --> 40:06.967

40:07.000 --> 40:09.867

ON THE SNOWBOARDS?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.167
WELL...

40:11.200 --> 40:13.433
THEY'RE NOT BOYS.

40:13.467 --> 40:16.833
WELL, ONE OF THEM IS,
SORT OF.

40:18.367 --> 40:20.400
THE OTHER ONE, SHANE,

40:20.433 --> 40:21.767
SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
TONIGHT

40:21.800 --> 40:24.233
TO HER GIRLFRIEND,
CARMEN.

40:26.433 --> 40:28.167
I THINK
I'M MARRYING THEM.

40:30.533 --> 40:31.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:34.400 --> 40:37.133
I'M A MARRIAGE COMMISSIONER.

40:37.167 --> 40:39.033
I PERFORM WEDDING CEREMONIES,

40:39.067 --> 40:40.833

40:42.200 --> 40:43.900
NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:47.167 --> 40:48.333
SO I JUST...

40:48.367 --> 40:49.700
I THINK IT WAS
TOO MUCH FOR ME,

40:49.733 --> 40:51.167
LOSING HER TWICE.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.367
YOU'RE LIKE ROXANNE
IN CYRANO DE BERGERAC.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.133
"IN MY LIFE,
I'VE HAD BUT ONE LOVE,

40:58.167 --> 41:01.767
AND NOW I MUST
LOSE HIM TWICE."

41:03.933 --> 41:05.467
HOW IS IT THAT
YOU'RE 56 YEARS OLD

41:05.500 --> 41:07.733
AND YOU'VE ONLY SLEPT
WITH TWO WOMEN?

41:07.767 --> 41:08.933
I MEAN,
WHEN DID YOU REALIZE

41:08.967 --> 41:10.900
YOU WERE A DYKE?

41:10.933 --> 41:12.067
WELL, ALICE,

41:12.067 --> 41:15.567
IN 1973, I WAS MARRIED

41:15.600 --> 41:18.733
AND LIVING IN PALO ALTO,
CALIFORNIA.

41:18.767 --> 41:21.567
I JOINED THIS WOMEN'S
CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING GROUP,

41:21.600 --> 41:23.567
AND THERE WAS
THIS WOMAN, TERI.

41:23.600 --> 41:27.233
OH, SHE WAS SO FREE
AND IN HER SEXUAL POWER.

41:27.267 --> 41:28.967
I WAS WILDLY
ATTRACTED TO HER.

41:29.067 --> 41:30.600
SO YOU GUYS GOT IT ON?

41:30.633 --> 41:31.800
NO, WE KISSED ONCE,

41:31.833 --> 41:34.067
AND I GUESS
I WAS TOO SCARED.

41:34.067 --> 41:35.900
NO, THE FIRST TIME

41:35.933 --> 41:37.067
I MADE LOVE TO A WOMAN

41:37.100 --> 41:38.667
WAS ABOUT ONE YEAR LATER.

41:38.700 --> 41:40.133
SHE WAS AN HEIRESS.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.900
AN HEIRESS?
YEAH.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.267
SHE HIRED MY HUSBAND CHET

41:45.300 --> 41:48.500
TO DESIGN HER WEST COAST
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.

41:48.533 --> 41:50.833
OH, SHE WAS FABULOUS--

41:50.867 --> 41:54.267
SO BEAUTIFUL
AND ARROGANT.

41:54.300 --> 41:58.467
SO YOU SLEPT
WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S BOSS.

41:58.500 --> 41:59.767

52:58.900 --> 53:01.500
I'M GOING TO DANCE.

53:01.533 --> 53:04.267
* IN YOUR EYES

53:04.300 --> 53:08.200
* IT MAY TAKE A KISS

53:08.233 --> 53:13.133
* OR TWO

53:13.167 --> 53:14.833
* THROUGH...

53:14.867 --> 53:16.633
I HAVEN'T DONE THIS
SINCE I WAS, LIKE...

53:16.667 --> 53:17.633
OW!

53:17.667 --> 53:18.867
[LAUGHS]

53:18.900 --> 53:20.067
14...

53:20.100 --> 53:21.200
AND IT WAS AWFUL,

53:21.233 --> 53:22.200
BECAUSE
MY LITTLE SISTER

53:22.233 --> 53:23.267
WAS REALLY GOOD
AT IT,

53:23.300 --> 53:24.467
AND I JUST...

53:24.500 --> 53:27.367
ALWAYS ENDED UP
MAKING BIG, GIANT KNOTS.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.133
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
A LITTLE SISTER.

53:29.167 --> 53:30.167
YEAH.
REALLY?

53:30.200 --> 53:31.333
YEAH, I DO,

53:31.367 --> 53:32.633
AND THREE BROTHERS.

53:32.667 --> 53:33.767
YOU DO?

53:33.800 --> 53:35.100
THAT'S A BIG FAMILY.

53:35.133 --> 53:36.433
I KNOW.

53:36.467 --> 53:39.333
OW...

53:41.167 --> 53:43.600
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE'RE,
YOU KNOW, FINALLY--

53:43.633 --> 53:45.300
ALICE...

53:45.333 --> 53:46.500
WHAT?

53:46.533 --> 53:48.067
WHAT?

53:48.067 --> 53:49.633
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

53:49.667 --> 53:51.133
[TINA]: HEY, YOU TWO.

53:51.167 --> 53:52.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
SITTING OUT HERE?

53:54.300 --> 53:56.700
WE'RE--
WE'RE JUST PLAYING.

53:56.733 --> 53:58.467
YOU KNOW, TRYING
TO GET OVER

53:58.500 --> 54:00.533
THE DEBACLE
OF THE EVENING.

54:00.567 --> 54:02.067
WHAT A NIGHT, HUH?

54:02.067 --> 54:03.867
POOR CARMEN.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.067
WHAT DO YOU
THINK HAPPENED?

54:05.067 --> 54:07.067
WELL, SHANE'S FATHER

54:07.100 --> 54:09.833
FOUND $10,000,
LEFT HIS WIFE,

54:09.867 --> 54:11.833
AND RAN OFF
WITH SOME FLOOZY.

54:11.867 --> 54:12.733
[HENRY]:
WHAT?

54:12.767 --> 54:13.833
YEAH.

54:13.867 --> 54:14.967
HEY.

54:15.067 --> 54:16.100
[TINA]: WHERE
DID SHANE'S DAD

54:16.133 --> 54:17.100
GET $10,000?

54:17.133 --> 54:18.100
I DON'T KNOW.

54:18.133 --> 54:20.133
OH, MY GOD.

54:20.167 --> 54:23.733
IS THAT
WHAT HAPPENED?

54:27.300 --> 54:28.867
WELL, HE HAS NO MONEY.

54:28.900 --> 54:32.433
HE WANTED TO BUY HER
A WEDDING GIFT.

54:32.467 --> 54:34.067
IT WAS HEARTBREAKING.

54:34.067 --> 54:35.367
[VALET]:
MRS. PEABODY,

54:35.400 --> 54:36.367
WILL THERE BE
ANYTHING ELSE?

54:36.400 --> 54:37.367
NO, NO, NO, FINE.

54:37.400 --> 54:39.633
I'LL BE THERE
IN A MOMENT.

54:39.667 --> 54:41.067
MY DARLING,
I HAVE CHERISHED

54:41.100 --> 54:43.067
THE TIME
WE'VE SPENT TOGETHER.

54:43.067 --> 54:46.167
IT HAS REAFFIRMED
ALL OF MY RECENT CONVICTIONS,

54:46.200 --> 54:48.833
AND NOW,
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU SO VERY MUCH,

54:48.867 --> 54:51.367
I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING
TRULY RADICAL.

54:51.400 --> 54:54.067
MOMMY, HE TOLD ME
HE WAS GOING TO--

54:54.100 --> 54:57.400
SWEETHEART, SWEETHEART...

54:57.433 --> 55:00.067
I'M CUTTING YOU OFF
FINANCIALLY.

55:00.100 --> 55:02.533
FROM THIS MOMENT FORTH,

55:02.567 --> 55:04.733
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
MAKE RELATIONSHIPS

55:04.767 --> 55:07.967
WITH PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU
FOR YOURSELF,

55:08.067 --> 55:10.067
NOT YOUR MONEY.

55:11.933 --> 55:13.767
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

55:13.800 --> 55:15.933
THIS IS GOING TO TURN
YOUR LIFE AROUND, DARLING.

55:15.967 --> 55:18.167
YOU'RE SUCH
A WONDERFUL GIRL,

55:18.200 --> 55:20.400
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

55:20.433 --> 55:23.800
YOU HAVE SUCH
A SURPRISINGLY KIND HEART.

55:23.833 --> 55:25.633
YOU NEED TO KNOW

55:25.667 --> 55:30.100
THAT PEOPLE LOVE YOU
EVEN IF YOU ARE PENNILESS.

55:39.867 --> 55:42.167
IT WAS WONDERFUL
TO MEET YOU, HELENA.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.167
I LOOK FORWARD
TO GETTING TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.433
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

55:50.833 --> 55:53.067
[ALICE]:
WOW. GO, MARILYN.

56:01.500 --> 56:02.900
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

56:05.567 --> 56:06.767
[WHISPERING]:
I CANNOT BELIEVE

56:06.800 --> 56:07.867
WHAT PEGGY DID.

56:07.900 --> 56:09.700
THAT WAS SO...

56:09.733 --> 56:11.467
I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.

56:11.500 --> 56:12.867
DID YOU SEE THE LOOK
ON HER FACE?

56:12.900 --> 56:14.267
SHE LOOKED LIKE
A LITTLE GIRL.

56:14.300 --> 56:15.667
IT WAS CRAZY.

56:17.233 --> 56:18.933
[FULL VOICE]:
WHERE IS SHE?

56:18.967 --> 56:20.167
WHERE ARE THEY?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.567
I DON'T KNOW. OUT?

56:24.733 --> 56:25.867
WHAT'S THAT?

56:25.900 --> 56:28.467
"EVERYTHING WAS FINE
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.

56:28.500 --> 56:29.967
"WE READ HER FAVORITE BOOK

56:30.067 --> 56:32.700
UNTIL HER OTHER MOTHER
CAME FOR HER."

56:32.733 --> 56:35.700
FUCK YOU, BETTE.

56:35.733 --> 56:37.133
BETTE, IT'S TINA.

56:37.167 --> 56:38.667
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

56:38.700 --> 56:40.933
THIS IS NOT YOUR NIGHT
WITH ANGELICA.

56:40.967 --> 56:42.367
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

56:42.400 --> 56:43.767
THIS IS NOT OKAY.

56:43.800 --> 56:46.200
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

56:46.233 --> 56:47.800
[FUSSING]

56:47.833 --> 56:48.933
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

56:48.967 --> 56:50.500
IT'S OKAY.

56:50.533 --> 56:52.933
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO
BE JUST FINE.

56:52.967 --> 56:55.500
YEAH, ANGELICA
AND MAMA B,

56:55.533 --> 56:57.233
WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO

56:57.267 --> 56:59.200
UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

56:59.233 --> 57:01.167
OKAY?

57:01.200 --> 57:03.867
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

57:03.900 --> 57:06.067
