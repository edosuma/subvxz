00:41.081 --> 00:42.875
Don't move.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.115
Wait. Wait.

00:44.117 --> 00:45.717
- Stop moving.
- Wait.

00:58.365 --> 00:59.835
You're serious?

01:00.601 --> 01:03.935
You're going to allow them
to walk me out of my own home

01:03.937 --> 01:06.104
in handcuffs like a common criminal?

01:06.106 --> 01:07.606
I am a Lexington.

01:08.385 --> 01:09.808
My late father-in-law

01:09.810 --> 01:11.343
was a state senator.

01:11.345 --> 01:13.098
His father was governor.

01:14.014 --> 01:16.114
And there's no one that you can call?

01:16.116 --> 01:17.749
Nothing that you can do?

01:17.751 --> 01:19.784
You're his spouse, Mrs. Lexington,

01:19.786 --> 01:23.255
and the spouse is almost always
considered a suspect.

01:23.257 --> 01:26.024
Now, I presume their theory

01:26.026 --> 01:29.728
of the crime is that
you somehow tried to make it

01:29.730 --> 01:32.764
look like it was a break-in
in order to cover your tracks.

01:32.766 --> 01:34.833
Now, I will try to get them

01:34.835 --> 01:38.069
to forgo the handcuffs
until they have you in the car,

01:38.071 --> 01:41.406
but the truth is the sooner that
they get you to the precinct,

01:41.408 --> 01:43.108
the sooner they book you,

01:43.110 --> 01:46.077
and the sooner we get to court;
and that's what we want.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.347
We will plead innocent, I will post bail,

01:49.349 --> 01:53.151
and hopefully I'll have you
back here by this afternoon.

01:58.602 --> 01:59.691
Mrs. Lexington!

01:59.693 --> 02:01.860
Did you kill your husband?

02:01.862 --> 02:04.260
What evidence does
the police have against you?

02:04.262 --> 02:06.731
Mrs. Lexington! Are the rumors true?

02:06.733 --> 02:09.401
<i>Anyone who follows the Lexington family</i>

02:09.402 --> 02:10.801
<i>knows that Rebecca Lexington</i>

02:10.804 --> 02:13.972
is a devoted wife and mother.

02:13.974 --> 02:16.363
The idea that she would just

02:16.365 --> 02:20.011
suddenly decide to kill her husband?

02:20.013 --> 02:22.881
Oh, please. Can we at least
be honest with each other?

02:22.883 --> 02:25.450
Those who've had the misfortune
of dealing with Mrs. Lexington

02:25.452 --> 02:26.918
have nothing nice to say.

02:26.920 --> 02:29.120
And I can tell you, finding jurors

02:29.122 --> 02:32.357
who haven't already made up
their mind about your client,

02:32.359 --> 02:34.849
that is gonna be a Herculean task.

02:34.851 --> 02:36.861
Would it make this
any more interesting to you

02:36.863 --> 02:38.596
if I told you she was innocent?

02:38.598 --> 02:40.165
You're sure about that?

02:40.167 --> 02:42.200
she was with her daughter

02:42.202 --> 02:43.835
in the city the night of the murder.

02:43.837 --> 02:45.537
Could never have made it back in time.

02:45.539 --> 02:47.605
So if the wife didn't do it, who did?

02:47.607 --> 02:49.407
This thief, this robber.

02:49.409 --> 02:51.509
And this particular thief decided to pick

02:51.511 --> 02:55.347
the most high-profile family
in the neighborhood to rob.

02:55.349 --> 02:58.183
Why not? He made out
very well... four watches

02:58.185 --> 03:00.452
- worth over $200,000.
- That's chump change.

03:00.454 --> 03:03.121
Come on, no art, no
electronics, no jewelry?

03:03.123 --> 03:05.824
What, he just decided to
leave that stuff behind?

03:05.826 --> 03:08.193
The jewelry and the valuables
were locked in the safe.

03:08.195 --> 03:10.729
And it's not exactly easy
to run through the woods

03:10.731 --> 03:13.098
with a Mondrian strapped to your back.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.333
So, one more thing for you to chew on.

03:15.335 --> 03:17.441
Rebecca has never owned a gun.

03:17.443 --> 03:20.472
And as far as we can tell,
she's never even fired a gun.

03:20.474 --> 03:23.341
Her husband was killed
by a single bullet to the head.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.544
Dead center. Kill shot.

03:26.546 --> 03:28.113
- Hmm.
- Jason.

03:28.115 --> 03:29.481
Don't be a fool.

03:29.483 --> 03:32.217
This is the case that we've
all dreamed of, you know?

03:32.219 --> 03:34.686
Wealthy family, worldwide attention.

03:36.089 --> 03:38.590
It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

03:38.592 --> 03:40.592
Don't say no.

03:45.899 --> 03:48.099
It's... it's good.

03:48.101 --> 03:49.667
It is, right?

03:49.669 --> 03:51.903
I mean, nobody's looking
at that paper and says,

03:51.905 --> 03:53.304
"Eh, it's a 'C.'"

03:53.306 --> 03:54.639
Well...

03:54.641 --> 03:57.409
not me, but I'm not your professor.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.077
I'm not the one handing out the grades.

03:59.079 --> 04:02.647
But still, no matter what
your prejudices might be,

04:02.649 --> 04:04.682
no matter how much you might dislike

04:04.684 --> 04:07.652
tall, good-looking,
impeccably dressed men,

04:07.654 --> 04:09.254
that's an "A."

04:09.256 --> 04:10.789
Come on, man, what?

04:10.791 --> 04:12.624
How long have you been in school?

04:12.626 --> 04:15.026
Two weeks? It's a little early

04:15.028 --> 04:16.995
to jump to conclusions, don't you think?

04:16.997 --> 04:18.430
I don't know.

04:18.567 --> 04:21.433
I-I can feel it with this guy.
He's got it in for me.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.924
Mm, even if he does,

04:22.926 --> 04:26.204
it's just one class, one professor.

04:26.206 --> 04:28.406
Even if it is a "C."

04:28.408 --> 04:30.241
It's not right.

04:31.411 --> 04:34.579
You know, when I was in law school,

04:34.581 --> 04:38.316
I had this professor,
right? Guy hated me.

04:38.318 --> 04:41.453
He was, like, a hundred
years old, and all he saw

04:41.455 --> 04:43.755
was this pugnacious Puerto Rican kid

04:43.757 --> 04:46.558
with long hair and lots of attitude.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.159
Did everything he could to let me know

04:48.161 --> 04:50.495
that there was no place for
me in the legal profession.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.363
So what happened?

04:52.943 --> 04:55.033
I'm here and he's dead.

04:55.035 --> 04:57.235
All right? So don't worry.

04:57.237 --> 04:59.237
This, too, will pass.

04:59.239 --> 05:00.738
Hey. Big guy's back

05:00.740 --> 05:02.974
- from Connecticut.
- Oh.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.645
We are helping to defend
Rebecca Lexington?

05:07.647 --> 05:10.281
The Witch of Wealth?
The Bitch of Greenwich?

05:10.283 --> 05:11.716
She said to say hello, by the way.

05:11.718 --> 05:13.451
Had nothing but great things
to say about you.

05:13.453 --> 05:15.088
Yes!

05:15.090 --> 05:17.522
We're taking a high-profile case
for a wealthy client

05:17.524 --> 05:19.290
simply because they asked

05:19.292 --> 05:21.426
and can afford to pay for our services.

05:21.428 --> 05:23.194
Send it to Ripley;
he wouldn't believe it.

05:23.196 --> 05:25.930
Yeah, but doesn't everybody
kind of already know

05:25.932 --> 05:27.365
that she did it?

05:27.367 --> 05:31.440
Mm, everybody <i> thinks</i>
they know she did it.

05:31.972 --> 05:33.938
So, what else is new?

05:33.940 --> 05:35.773
Notwithstanding
her terrible public image,

05:35.775 --> 05:38.343
the woman has neither
the means nor the motive

05:38.345 --> 05:40.345
to do what she has been accused of.

05:40.347 --> 05:42.981
She insists she is innocent,
and I, for one,

05:42.983 --> 05:44.415
have no reason to doubt her.

05:44.417 --> 05:46.985
Oh, yes, uh,

05:46.987 --> 05:50.054
lady in the back who clearly
needs a throat lozenge?

05:51.458 --> 05:53.625
I've walked hundreds of crime scenes,

05:53.627 --> 05:56.928
and on this one, I am inclined
to agree with the police.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.564
The broken glass pane
on the French doors...

05:59.566 --> 06:00.932
a professional would never pick

06:00.934 --> 06:03.334
such a loud and obvious entry point.

06:03.336 --> 06:04.769
And from what I've read,

06:04.771 --> 06:07.071
only the husband's belongings were taken.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.440
It all points to a staged scene.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.176
And a staged scene

06:11.178 --> 06:13.178
kind of brings you back to the wife.

06:13.180 --> 06:15.280
Eh, maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

06:15.282 --> 06:16.314
Benny,

06:16.316 --> 06:17.549
you and I should start

06:17.551 --> 06:19.250
zeroing in on voir dire strategy.

06:19.252 --> 06:21.286
Ah, voir dire, absolutely.

06:21.288 --> 06:24.622
Raise your hand if you already
dislike Rebecca Lexington.

06:24.624 --> 06:26.724
Well, I like that.
Subtle, kind of stealth.

06:26.726 --> 06:28.393
In general, what are your feelings

06:28.395 --> 06:30.795
towards rich white
people with an attitude?

06:30.797 --> 06:32.897
People ask, "What's it like

06:32.899 --> 06:34.599
working with that Benjamin ColÃ³n?"

06:37.004 --> 06:38.143
Talk to me.

06:38.504 --> 06:41.506
You familiar with a Kendall Tyler?

06:41.508 --> 06:43.908
Rings a bell, just not a very loud one.

06:43.910 --> 06:45.343
Esteemed biographer,

06:45.345 --> 06:47.412
especially of all things Lexington.

06:47.414 --> 06:49.781
She's written about the family
for the last decade.

06:49.783 --> 06:53.184
Won a lot of prizes for it.
I've read her. She's good.

06:53.186 --> 06:55.653
She's also outside;
she'd like to see you.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.590
Well, let's bring her in here.

06:59.426 --> 07:01.392
Kendall Tyler, Dr. Jason Bull.

07:01.394 --> 07:03.461
I'll be right outside if you need me.

07:03.463 --> 07:05.697
Nice to meet you, Ms. Tyler.

07:06.201 --> 07:08.299
To what do I owe the pleasure?

07:08.662 --> 07:10.501
A little birdie told me

07:10.503 --> 07:13.471
that you joined Rebecca
Lexington's legal team today.

07:14.167 --> 07:18.376
I make it a point never to
listen to anything with wings

07:18.378 --> 07:20.511
or... more than two legs.

07:20.513 --> 07:22.914
But that's just me.

07:24.084 --> 07:26.184
Well, let's just assume it's true.

07:26.186 --> 07:28.853
I have information that
may just help you...

07:28.855 --> 07:32.624
information that could...
exonerate your client.

07:32.626 --> 07:33.658
Oh.

07:33.660 --> 07:35.772
But there are conditions.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.563
lead attorney on this case

07:38.565 --> 07:40.632
doesn't work for me, I work for him.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.368
And so if you have some kind
of proposition in mind...

07:43.370 --> 07:45.436
Oh, I'm very familiar with Mr. Bedford.

07:45.438 --> 07:47.438
And he is very familiar with me.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.707
I wrote a book three years ago

07:49.709 --> 07:51.509
in which he plays a significant role.

07:51.511 --> 07:54.279
I don't think he found
my portrayal accurate

07:54.281 --> 07:56.514
or... particularly flattering.

07:56.516 --> 07:57.447
Mm.

07:57.449 --> 07:59.984
And I doubt
Mrs. Lexington's a fan, either.

08:00.373 --> 08:01.519
Got it.

08:01.521 --> 08:03.354
So what are you looking for?

08:03.356 --> 08:06.124
What am I trading
for whatever's in that folder?

08:06.126 --> 08:08.493
Access... and I mean to everything.

08:08.495 --> 08:10.161
Client meetings, strategy sessions,

08:10.163 --> 08:12.196
prison visits, if it comes to that.

08:12.642 --> 08:14.223
I want to write the definitive book,

08:14.225 --> 08:15.366
and with that kind of access...

08:15.368 --> 08:17.969
You'll have publishing houses
fighting over it. I get it.

08:17.971 --> 08:19.404
But, as I already indicated,

08:19.406 --> 08:22.440
Bedford is the captain
of this particular team,

08:22.442 --> 08:24.242
and if he doesn't like you...

08:24.244 --> 08:27.412
I'm counting on you to convince him.

08:27.414 --> 08:29.280
And Mrs. Lexington.

08:29.282 --> 08:31.316
And anyone else necessary.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.019
All right, let me say this back to you,

08:35.020 --> 08:36.321
see if I understand it.

08:36.323 --> 08:39.023
You supposedly have information
that will prove my client

08:39.025 --> 08:41.958
did <i> not</i> commit the crime
of which she is accused,

08:41.961 --> 08:43.828
and you are completely comfortable

08:43.830 --> 08:46.531
not providing this information
and allowing her to spend

08:46.533 --> 08:49.534
the rest of her life in prison,
unless you get what you want.

08:49.536 --> 08:51.069
Have I got that right?

08:51.071 --> 08:52.140
No.

08:52.472 --> 08:54.339
You and your colleagues have been offered

08:54.341 --> 08:56.474
potential intelligence
that could be the key

08:56.476 --> 08:58.743
to your client's freedom,
and you're unwilling

08:58.745 --> 09:00.878
to do what's necessary to get it

09:00.880 --> 09:03.581
and keep her from being in
prison for the rest of her life.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.116
Oh.

09:05.118 --> 09:07.281
I believe that's
a more accurate portrayal

09:07.283 --> 09:08.319
of what's going on here.

09:08.321 --> 09:10.521
- Okay.
- Think about it.

09:10.523 --> 09:13.828
I left my number
with the nice lady outside.

09:16.296 --> 09:18.262
I wouldn't wait by the phone.

09:19.432 --> 09:27.537
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:32.134 --> 09:33.778
Trial by social media... that's really

09:33.803 --> 09:34.968
what we're talking about here.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.570
Everyone in America

09:36.572 --> 09:39.213
has been weighing in
on Rebecca Lexington's guilt.

09:39.238 --> 09:42.105
In the last 48 hours,
her name alone has generated

09:42.107 --> 09:44.641
- over three million hits.
- 3.8.

09:44.643 --> 09:46.376
Each one of those hits represents

09:46.378 --> 09:49.646
exactly the kind of juror
the other side wants.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.179
The type of person

09:51.181 --> 09:53.784
who will happily buy into
this tabloid narrative

09:53.786 --> 09:56.320
of a fairy-tale marriage on the rocks,

09:56.322 --> 09:58.755
a scheming wife, a faked crime scene.

09:58.757 --> 10:00.657
Sensationalists, fantasists.

10:00.659 --> 10:02.960
People susceptible to drama and scandal.

10:02.962 --> 10:05.462
And they are gonna make up
the vast majority

10:05.464 --> 10:06.382
of our jury pool.

10:06.384 --> 10:09.733
Look, Rebecca Lexington
is not a bad person.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.401
She married into the family

10:11.403 --> 10:14.237
hoping she was going to be
their Princess Diana.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.974
Instead, she got cast as their Camilla.

10:16.976 --> 10:20.677
What do we do now?

10:21.104 --> 10:22.846
Ever heard of Occam's razor?

10:22.848 --> 10:26.249
The idea that if there are
two explanations for something,

10:26.251 --> 10:30.087
the simpler explanation
is usually the correct one.

10:30.089 --> 10:32.656
the more assumptions

10:32.658 --> 10:35.025
you have to make
for a theory to make sense,

10:35.027 --> 10:36.560
the more unlikely that theory is.

10:36.562 --> 10:37.995
We need jurors

10:37.997 --> 10:41.965
who subscribe to the former and
are suspicious of the latter.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.467
Wouldn't you know it,

10:43.469 --> 10:46.203
I go out to my car today, tire's flat.

10:46.205 --> 10:48.381
I have no idea how that happened.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.375
Anyone want to hazard a guess?

10:51.377 --> 10:53.477
You're a famous attorney.

10:53.479 --> 10:57.280
Probably made a lot of enemies
over the years.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.726
Maybe one of them slashed it.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.888
Your Honor, we move to strike this juror.

11:05.523 --> 11:06.990
How about you?

11:06.992 --> 11:08.258
What's your theory?

11:08.260 --> 11:09.493
I don't know.

11:09.495 --> 11:12.362
I-I'm thinking you probably
just ran over a nail.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.241
You know, I'm thinking the same thing.

11:16.201 --> 11:18.161
Your Honor, this juror is acceptable.

11:18.537 --> 11:21.738
What we want is a juror
who's gonna ask him or herself,

11:21.740 --> 11:24.574
"Is it more likely that Rebecca Lexington

11:24.576 --> 11:27.344
"drove 35 miles home to Greenwich

11:27.346 --> 11:29.880
"after an early dinner,
executed her beloved husband

11:29.882 --> 11:32.382
"of 20 years
with a single shot to the head,

11:32.384 --> 11:34.651
"staged a crime scene
to look like a break-in,

11:34.653 --> 11:36.953
"and then somehow disposed of the gun

11:36.955 --> 11:39.189
"in a place the police
could never find, all before

11:39.191 --> 11:41.425
the police responded to the burglary?"

11:41.910 --> 11:44.995
Our ideal juror
is gonna like things clean,

11:44.997 --> 11:48.298
straightforward and uncomplicated.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.233
What's your favorite movie?

11:50.693 --> 11:52.569
Anything by Christopher Nolan.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.405
Oh, yeah, he's great.

11:55.808 --> 11:57.507
Your Honor, we move to strike

11:57.509 --> 11:59.276
both of these jurors.

11:59.278 --> 12:01.278
And how about you, miss?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.180
Me? Oh.

12:03.182 --> 12:06.149
I like horror movies and also comedy.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.585
Oh, Adam Sandler... he makes me laugh.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.023
This juror is acceptable.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.725
We have our jury.

12:14.727 --> 12:16.406
Trial will begin day after tomorrow.

12:17.429 --> 12:18.995
How'd we do?

12:18.997 --> 12:21.431
We... did okay.

12:21.433 --> 12:23.600
Four jurors... we're a third
of the way there.

12:23.602 --> 12:26.970
Now all we have to do is not
lose ours to the other side

12:26.972 --> 12:29.673
and, uh, get the other side
to see things our way.

12:30.108 --> 12:31.641
You're very smart.

12:31.643 --> 12:32.489
Well...

12:32.491 --> 12:35.078
I'm very pleased that
you are working with us.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.214
Very pleased that Henry
reached out to you.

12:37.216 --> 12:39.616
Do you think that you
could swing by the house

12:39.618 --> 12:41.184
and meet my daughter, Olivia?

12:41.186 --> 12:43.787
She's beside herself with all of this.

12:43.789 --> 12:46.590
I think meeting you would
make all the difference.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.372
Love to.

12:49.245 --> 12:50.427
Thank you.

12:52.963 --> 12:53.897
Dr. Bull.

12:54.889 --> 12:56.094
Oh, Ms. Tyler.

12:56.096 --> 12:58.769
Oh, don't look so surprised.
It's a public courtroom.

12:58.771 --> 13:01.471
And I'm writing my book
with or without you.

13:01.473 --> 13:03.140
Though, frankly, I'd rather write it

13:03.142 --> 13:04.808
from the inside than the outside.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.476
I think we've already had
this conversation.

13:06.478 --> 13:07.644
If you'll excuse me.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.412
Since you're going to the house,

13:09.414 --> 13:12.015
ask about the oil.

13:12.017 --> 13:13.716
You need me, Dr. Bull.

13:13.718 --> 13:14.978
I know things.

13:26.078 --> 13:27.905
These beautiful old homes.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.767
Boiler's a hundred years old.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.703
It's forever giving out.

13:33.705 --> 13:35.839
Can I grab you a drink?

13:35.841 --> 13:37.284
It's the maid's day off.

13:37.286 --> 13:39.676
No, I'm good, Henry. Thanks.

13:39.678 --> 13:43.046
There is the good doctor. Dr. Bull.

13:43.048 --> 13:45.882
I'd like to introduce you
to my daughter, Olivia.

13:45.884 --> 13:47.017
Dr. Bull.

13:47.019 --> 13:48.518
Ah, Olivia.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.979
It's nice to meet you.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.556
I'm sorry about your father.

13:52.558 --> 13:54.191
And I'm sorry about

13:54.193 --> 13:56.193
all that your mother's
been going through.

13:56.195 --> 13:57.612
I know it's a lot.

13:58.797 --> 14:01.032
Your mom tells me you're nervous.

14:01.500 --> 14:05.268
I just want you to know
that's understandable.

14:05.870 --> 14:06.979
After all,

14:06.981 --> 14:09.673
you really are her alibi.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.008
In any event,

14:12.010 --> 14:13.476
if I can get you and your mom

14:13.478 --> 14:15.145
to come to my offices tomorrow...

14:15.147 --> 14:16.406
Oh, really? Tomorrow? I was
hoping that we would have...

14:16.408 --> 14:19.316
I think it's important
to take the one free day we have

14:19.318 --> 14:21.785
and prepare you both
for the witness stand.

14:21.787 --> 14:24.054
I think it would help Olivia, and I know

14:24.056 --> 14:27.892
it would be enlightening
for you and Henry.

14:29.557 --> 14:31.990
Henry, where's the heat?

14:31.992 --> 14:33.192
Where's the oil?

14:33.194 --> 14:34.526
Excuse me?

14:34.528 --> 14:36.929
Look, I told you,
these old houses, it's just...

14:36.931 --> 14:38.897
Knock it off. Where's the help?

14:39.529 --> 14:40.933
It's the maid's night off.

14:40.935 --> 14:42.907
More like the maid's month off.

14:43.270 --> 14:45.372
These people are broke, Henry.

14:45.374 --> 14:47.006
Look, if you're worried
about getting paid...

14:47.008 --> 14:49.074
Well, first and foremost,
now that you've attached

14:49.076 --> 14:51.343
my name to it, I'm worried about winning.

14:51.345 --> 14:52.678
I'm worried about doing my job.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.080
Let me tell you about me.
I traffic in the truth.

14:55.082 --> 14:57.483
I know when I'm hearing it,
and I know when I'm not.

14:57.485 --> 14:59.351
And at the moment,

14:59.353 --> 15:00.753
it's in fairly short supply.

15:00.755 --> 15:02.254
- Jason...
- And I know

15:02.256 --> 15:05.457
that that doesn't necessarily
mean your client is guilty.

15:05.459 --> 15:08.727
But I also know I cannot win this thing

15:08.729 --> 15:12.097
if people think they're gonna
lie their way through it.

15:13.601 --> 15:15.501
So if you want my help,

15:15.503 --> 15:19.004
you and your clients will be at my office

15:19.006 --> 15:21.640
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

15:21.642 --> 15:23.442
Understood?

15:24.945 --> 15:26.993
Understood.

15:36.016 --> 15:37.816
Something about sitting in this chair,

15:37.818 --> 15:39.751
taking the oath, it changes you.

15:40.333 --> 15:42.966
And I want both of you
to be ready for that.

15:42.968 --> 15:45.323
At the same time, it gives us a chance

15:45.325 --> 15:48.159
to see if your stories
hold up under scrutiny.

15:48.161 --> 15:51.229
Mr. ColÃ³n will play the role
of prosecutor.

15:51.231 --> 15:53.598
But remember, this isn't really court,

15:53.600 --> 15:57.102
so if anyone has
anything to say, feel free.

15:57.104 --> 15:58.803
Sing out.

15:58.805 --> 16:00.405
It won't be held against you.

16:00.407 --> 16:02.574
Let the games begin. Mr. ColÃ³n.

16:06.146 --> 16:08.479
Good morning, Ms. Lexington.

16:08.748 --> 16:11.449
My condolences
on the death of your father.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.351
Um, thank you.

16:13.353 --> 16:16.554
Now, is it your testimony
that the night of the murder,

16:16.556 --> 16:19.687
your mother was 35 miles
away from home with you

16:19.687 --> 16:21.053
in New York City?

16:21.055 --> 16:22.288
Yes, sir.

16:22.290 --> 16:24.257
And what were you two doing that evening?

16:24.259 --> 16:26.192
Uh, we had dinner at Del Posto.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.527
Do you recall what time?

16:28.529 --> 16:30.563
It was around 6:00.

16:30.565 --> 16:31.731
And what time did it finish?

16:31.733 --> 16:34.200
- Uh, it was about 8:00.
- 8:00 p.m.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.636
And the burglar alarm
indicating the break-in

16:36.638 --> 16:41.607
and the probable time of death
was at 7:20.

16:42.944 --> 16:44.176
I don't know.

16:44.178 --> 16:46.322
I mean, I mean,
if that's what they told you.

16:47.573 --> 16:50.383
You sure it was Del Posto
where you and your mother ate?

16:50.385 --> 16:51.744
Of course.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.088
Would you happen to have
a receipt for the meal?

16:56.666 --> 16:57.957
Excuse me?

16:57.959 --> 16:59.325
A receipt.

16:59.327 --> 17:01.627
To show that you were there,
to prove that you paid,

17:01.629 --> 17:03.963
because Del Posto has no record

17:03.965 --> 17:06.965
of serving you or your
mother that evening.

17:06.968 --> 17:08.434
No credit card,

17:08.435 --> 17:10.636
no reservation under the name Lexington.

17:10.637 --> 17:12.204
Honey?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.441
Because we paid with cash.

17:15.443 --> 17:17.042
Do you remember?

17:18.046 --> 17:19.744
I paid... I paid with cash.

17:20.064 --> 17:21.213
And there's no record of the reservation

17:21.214 --> 17:22.848
because we just walked in off the street

17:22.849 --> 17:24.817
and asked for a table for two.

17:24.819 --> 17:26.218
Didn't give a name.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.188
Oh.

17:31.033 --> 17:33.559
Is that how you remember it?

17:33.561 --> 17:35.621
Uh, yes. Okay.

17:35.997 --> 17:39.131
Because Del Posto was
completely sold out that night.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.233
They told us that there was no way

17:41.235 --> 17:45.006
that they would or could seat
anyone without a reservation.

17:46.215 --> 17:50.009
Do you know what the penalty is
for providing

17:50.011 --> 17:53.222
false testimony in
a murder trial in Connecticut?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.917
Even to protect one's own mother?

17:57.919 --> 17:59.719
All right, all right, that's enough.

17:59.721 --> 18:01.654
You are terrifying my daughter.

18:01.656 --> 18:03.322
What would you have us do,
Mrs. Lexington?

18:03.324 --> 18:05.191
You offered her up as a sacrificial lamb.

18:05.193 --> 18:07.626
It's clear the two of you didn't
have dinner in that restaurant.

18:07.628 --> 18:08.894
I'm guessing you weren't even together.

18:08.896 --> 18:10.496
- Jason.
- No, you're wrong.

18:10.498 --> 18:11.497
We were.

18:11.499 --> 18:13.032
We were together. We were there.

18:13.034 --> 18:14.533
She wasn't anywhere near the house.

18:14.535 --> 18:15.828
Olivia.

18:16.191 --> 18:17.657
They're ahead of us.

18:19.273 --> 18:23.175
And they are here trying
to help us, I think.

18:25.013 --> 18:28.549
Can we speak in private?
Just you and me and Henry.

18:31.119 --> 18:35.488
I am not unaware of what people
think of me... the press,

18:35.490 --> 18:36.956
the public.

18:36.958 --> 18:40.459
And it is difficult sometimes

18:40.461 --> 18:43.462
to think clearly,
especially when you know

18:43.464 --> 18:46.532
that people have opinions about you.

18:50.488 --> 18:52.671
I was not in New York City on the night

18:52.673 --> 18:53.906
that my husband was murdered.

18:53.908 --> 18:56.342
I was in Greenwich, and
I was having a meeting

18:56.344 --> 18:57.411
with an attorney.

18:57.912 --> 18:59.712
A divorce attorney.

19:00.498 --> 19:01.846
Did you know about this?

19:01.848 --> 19:04.050
I introduced her to the attorney,

19:04.052 --> 19:06.819
but I was unaware
that that is where she was

19:06.821 --> 19:09.288
on the night she claimed
to be in New York City.

19:09.290 --> 19:11.323
Well, how would that have looked?

19:11.634 --> 19:13.559
The night that my husband
is shot to death,

19:13.561 --> 19:15.736
I'm off plotting to leave the marriage?

19:15.738 --> 19:17.163
Well, it would've looked horrible.

19:17.165 --> 19:18.531
But it would've looked like the truth.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.331
Trust me, the other side can
smell the stink on your alibi.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.369
We are gonna have to
get out in front of it

19:23.371 --> 19:25.271
when we get to court tomorrow.

19:27.275 --> 19:28.774
Let's work together

19:28.776 --> 19:30.910
on your opening statement.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.345
Is there anything else?

19:34.916 --> 19:36.515
Tell me about the marriage.

19:37.952 --> 19:40.519
Our only child just moved out
and went to college.

19:40.521 --> 19:43.499
Suddenly there was
nothing to hide behind.

19:44.425 --> 19:46.961
No one to put up a facade for.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.255
Tell him the rest.

19:51.499 --> 19:53.699
My husband has...

19:55.136 --> 19:58.556
<i>...had</i> a very serious gambling problem.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.007
If his family didn't
own our home outright,

20:02.009 --> 20:03.843
then that would've been gone long ago.

20:03.845 --> 20:06.445
If it was liquid, Jeremy would spend it.

20:06.447 --> 20:09.248
His mother and his father
cut him off years ago.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.217
And that's why there's no heat?

20:11.219 --> 20:12.718
Is that why there's no help?

20:12.720 --> 20:15.254
We were almost to the bottom of the well.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.890
Before Halloween,

20:17.892 --> 20:21.727
we sold what was left of the stocks

20:21.729 --> 20:25.464
so that we could pay for
Olivia's tuition next semester,

20:25.466 --> 20:29.068
but... Jeremy found a way to gamble that

20:29.070 --> 20:31.797
before it even got to
the bursar, and that was it.

20:32.406 --> 20:34.440
I told him I was done.

20:34.759 --> 20:37.943
I told him that I was
going to see someone about

20:37.945 --> 20:39.812
- putting an end to it.
- How'd he take it?

20:39.814 --> 20:41.780
He was apoplectic.

20:44.886 --> 20:46.852
Shall I start with the bad news?

20:46.854 --> 20:48.888
The state attorney's office
almost certainly knows

20:48.890 --> 20:50.589
about your husband's gambling.

20:50.591 --> 20:53.325
That is very tough to keep secret.

20:53.327 --> 20:54.862
But the good news is...

20:56.030 --> 20:57.396
if you're telling the truth

20:57.398 --> 20:59.732
about the family having no money,

20:59.734 --> 21:02.434
you really have no motive
to kill your husband.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.972
Am I missing something?

21:09.710 --> 21:11.610
There's an insurance policy.

21:11.612 --> 21:15.706
Jeremy insisted that we
buy it six months ago.

21:15.708 --> 21:19.451
$25 million on his life.

21:19.453 --> 21:23.622
And, of course, I am the beneficiary.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.894
Forget everything I said after
"the good news is."

21:36.752 --> 21:40.065
You think you know her... wife, mother,

21:40.090 --> 21:42.858
philanthropist, socialite.

21:42.860 --> 21:46.998
Married into one of the richest
families in the country.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.964
But you don't know her.

21:48.966 --> 21:51.700
This spoiled member of the one percent

21:51.702 --> 21:54.236
who suddenly discovered
that she was going to lose

21:54.238 --> 21:56.738
her extravagant lifestyle.

21:56.740 --> 21:59.041
Suddenly discovered that her husband,

21:59.043 --> 22:02.110
a handsome and much-admired member

22:02.112 --> 22:05.447
of the Lexington dynasty,
had been secretly

22:05.449 --> 22:09.151
gambling away
the family's fortune for years.

22:10.487 --> 22:12.955
The fortune that was supposed to be

22:12.957 --> 22:15.190
her and her daughter's future.

22:15.722 --> 22:17.401
_

22:17.426 --> 22:18.427
So she killed him.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.930
Murdered her husband of 20 years,

22:21.932 --> 22:24.099
not only to reap the satisfaction

22:24.101 --> 22:27.336
of slaying the man who betrayed
her and their daughter,

22:27.338 --> 22:32.307
but also because with his death
came a life insurance check

22:32.309 --> 22:35.611
for $25 million.

22:35.613 --> 22:38.180
And lest you think

22:38.182 --> 22:41.083
this murder was an act of passion,

22:41.302 --> 22:45.520
even her husband sensed a plan was afoot.

22:45.522 --> 22:47.141
The night of his murder...

22:48.359 --> 22:51.479
he left his wife a voice mail, a plea.

22:52.096 --> 22:54.229
Becky, honey, I'm sorry.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.797
I know you're mad.

22:55.799 --> 22:57.651
I know you hate me.

22:58.035 --> 23:00.335
But you have to believe I love you.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.171
And you have to believe
I'm trying to make this right.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.440
Now, I'm sure

23:05.442 --> 23:09.177
you're all familiar with
the term "guilt by association."

23:10.331 --> 23:11.726
Have you ever heard of the term

23:11.728 --> 23:13.982
"guilt by accusation"?

23:13.984 --> 23:16.284
This is when a person's reputation

23:16.286 --> 23:20.630
is so notorious that,
unlike the rest of us,

23:20.632 --> 23:22.958
who are innocent until proven guilty,

23:22.960 --> 23:25.961
these people,
for all intents and purposes,

23:25.963 --> 23:29.064
<i>are</i> guilty,
until they're proven innocent.

23:29.725 --> 23:31.166
The prosecutor

23:31.168 --> 23:33.201
is going to tell you all about

23:33.203 --> 23:36.938
the mean things that Rebecca
Lexington has supposedly said

23:36.940 --> 23:39.307
and done to people throughout her life.

23:39.309 --> 23:42.544
This is how we get out in front
of the lies you told the police.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.346
None of that makes her a murderer.

23:44.348 --> 23:46.915
She'll even have
a police detective testify

23:46.917 --> 23:49.768
that Rebecca told them a different story

23:49.770 --> 23:51.319
than the one that she's going to tell you

23:51.321 --> 23:53.288
here in court.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.334
So...

23:56.919 --> 23:58.427
did Rebecca lie to the police

23:58.429 --> 24:01.563
when they first brought her in
and questioned her?

24:02.258 --> 24:02.998
Yes.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.933
Yes, she did.

24:04.935 --> 24:05.967
She was terrified.

24:05.969 --> 24:07.736
She panicked.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.905
She knows what they think about her,

24:09.907 --> 24:13.442
and she didn't think that they
were going to believe the truth.

24:13.811 --> 24:15.977
But she's going to tell you the truth.

24:17.147 --> 24:19.900
And I'm telling you the truth right now.

24:21.926 --> 24:23.006
This woman...

24:23.654 --> 24:25.287
she did not kill her husband.

24:27.157 --> 24:28.590
That was very impressive.

24:28.592 --> 24:31.159
For a moment,
even I had a glimmer of hope.

24:31.161 --> 24:33.695
Mom, just tell them
they're doing a good job.

24:33.697 --> 24:35.499
They know that's what I mean.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.938
You folks go on ahead.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.592
I'll catch up.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.379
You don't give up.

24:51.381 --> 24:54.583
You mean my plea for access?
I gave up days ago.

24:54.585 --> 24:57.819
No, I'm not here to ask for anything.

24:57.821 --> 25:00.055
I'm here to give you something.

25:00.357 --> 25:01.590
Ah, what's that?

25:01.592 --> 25:02.991
It's a website.

25:02.993 --> 25:04.960
I think you might find it interesting.

25:05.529 --> 25:07.429
Jeremy certainly did.

25:08.324 --> 25:09.564
Wait a second.

25:10.784 --> 25:12.267
I didn't get a chance to thank you

25:12.269 --> 25:13.935
for that "oil" tip.

25:14.371 --> 25:15.570
You're welcome.

25:16.498 --> 25:17.572
How'd you know?

25:17.574 --> 25:19.674
How do you know... this?

25:20.044 --> 25:21.443
It's my life.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.378
Knowing about the Lexingtons.

25:23.380 --> 25:26.181
Talking to anyone who knows
anything about the Lexingtons.

25:26.183 --> 25:27.582
It's all I do.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.384
So why the sudden change of heart?

25:29.386 --> 25:31.787
Why the sudden... generosity?

25:34.016 --> 25:35.857
I thought about what you said.

25:35.859 --> 25:39.661
About how I would feel if
Rebecca spent her life in jail,

25:40.418 --> 25:42.564
when perhaps I could have
made a difference.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.166
And who knows,

25:44.168 --> 25:45.934
maybe if you win this case,

25:45.936 --> 25:48.804
you'll remember my kindness,
let me interview you,

25:49.156 --> 25:51.616
convince Mr. Bedford
to give me another chance,

25:52.066 --> 25:53.842
and perhaps even persuade Mrs. Lexington

25:53.844 --> 25:55.811
to sit with me.

25:55.813 --> 25:59.181
Well, like you said,
we'd have to win first.

26:00.876 --> 26:03.185
I have great faith in you, Dr. Bull.

26:05.047 --> 26:06.321
Ah.

26:09.187 --> 26:10.254
<i>I'm afraid this is going to be</i>

26:10.256 --> 26:11.722
a long-term project, Dr. Bull.

26:11.724 --> 26:13.190
This address, if it's even legitimate,

26:13.192 --> 26:14.391
lives on the dark web.

26:14.393 --> 26:16.660
I may not have anything
for you until tomorrow.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.061
Ah.

26:18.063 --> 26:21.398
Well, then I'm gonna do
something I don't often do.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.898
I'm going home.

26:23.169 --> 26:25.502
Wow. I forgot you had a home.

26:25.504 --> 26:28.405
Me, too. And then I saw
this key I didn't recognize

26:28.407 --> 26:31.742
on my key chain, and it all
came rushing back to me.

26:31.744 --> 26:33.911
- See you in the morning, Cable.
- Night, Dr. Bull.

26:33.913 --> 26:35.579
<i> Detective Gates,</i>

26:35.581 --> 26:37.080
you're the lead homicide detective

26:37.082 --> 26:38.715
on the Jeremy Lexington murder, correct?

26:38.717 --> 26:39.883
Yes, ma'am.

26:39.885 --> 26:42.219
And did you visit the Lexingtons' home?

26:42.221 --> 26:43.287
Yes.

26:43.289 --> 26:44.955
And I believe you were the first

26:44.957 --> 26:47.534
to suggest the crime scene
had been staged.

26:47.536 --> 26:48.568
That's right.

26:48.570 --> 26:50.460
On what did you base that opinion?

26:50.462 --> 26:51.461
Couple of things...

26:51.463 --> 26:53.530
the biggest being the point of entry.

26:53.532 --> 26:55.177
The glass in the French doors.

26:55.179 --> 26:57.267
Yes. Made no sense.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.240
Breaking glass makes noise.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.938
Noise is something you want to avoid

27:00.940 --> 27:02.806
if you're breaking into a home.

27:02.808 --> 27:04.541
Also, when we arrived on the scene,

27:04.543 --> 27:06.910
the lights were on; there's
no way that intruder went

27:06.912 --> 27:09.479
through those doors and didn't
know that somebody was home.

27:09.481 --> 27:11.582
Again, makes no sense.

27:11.584 --> 27:14.017
A professional... he sees that,

27:14.019 --> 27:16.050
he's gonna find
another house to hit pronto.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.422
Objection! Facts not in evidence.

27:18.424 --> 27:19.656
Overruled.

27:19.658 --> 27:21.291
I'm just a glutton for punishment.

27:21.293 --> 27:22.392
What's the view

27:22.394 --> 27:23.694
from where you're sitting?

27:23.696 --> 27:25.762
It's not pretty. The mirror jurors

27:25.764 --> 27:29.132
are buying into the staged crime
scene theory across the board.

27:29.134 --> 27:31.085
Well, that's because
it makes perfect sense.

27:32.112 --> 27:34.263
Now, immediately after the crime,

27:34.265 --> 27:36.807
who did you zero in on as a suspect?

27:36.809 --> 27:38.008
Mrs. Lexington.

27:38.010 --> 27:39.810
And what led you to her?

27:39.812 --> 27:42.779
You've been doing this long
enough, you just kind of know.

27:42.781 --> 27:44.681
- So you questioned her?
- I did.

27:44.683 --> 27:46.010
And what did she tell you?

27:46.012 --> 27:47.668
That she was in New York City.

27:47.670 --> 27:50.153
That she couldn't possibly
have killed her husband.

27:52.024 --> 27:54.524
Well, then, that was that.

27:54.526 --> 27:56.326
Well, not really.

27:56.328 --> 27:58.278
Because when we followed up on her alibi,

27:58.280 --> 28:01.064
we discovered that she wasn't
in New York City at all.

28:01.066 --> 28:03.333
That she was right here
in Greenwich the whole time,

28:03.335 --> 28:05.836
and was perfectly capable
of committing the murder.

28:05.838 --> 28:07.626
So she lied.

28:07.628 --> 28:08.805
Yes, ma'am.

28:10.376 --> 28:12.943
No further questions at this time.

28:12.945 --> 28:15.212
The good news is
all the jurors are already read,

28:15.214 --> 28:17.314
so I have no bad news to report.

28:17.316 --> 28:19.950
Thanks, Marissa. You're always
looking out for me.

28:21.553 --> 28:23.954
So when the detectives
asked you where you were

28:23.956 --> 28:25.455
at the time of your father's death,

28:25.457 --> 28:27.024
you answered? In New York.

28:27.689 --> 28:30.160
I'm gonna need a more specific
answer than that.

28:30.162 --> 28:31.228
Where in New York?

28:31.230 --> 28:33.163
I told them that I was at Del Posto.

28:33.165 --> 28:34.631
It's a restaurant. It's on Tenth Avenue.

28:34.633 --> 28:36.700
And did they ask you who you were with?

28:36.702 --> 28:38.992
Yes, and I said my mother.

28:39.438 --> 28:41.316
And were you with your mother?

28:41.318 --> 28:43.106
No. That was a lie.

28:43.108 --> 28:44.533
And I'm sorry, but I thought...

28:44.535 --> 28:46.625
No. No, no, no, no.

28:47.012 --> 28:48.979
Only answer the questions that are asked.

28:48.981 --> 28:50.707
Don't volunteer anything else.

28:50.709 --> 28:51.748
Trust me,

28:51.750 --> 28:53.517
they'll get to everything.

28:53.519 --> 28:55.886
That's their job, okay?

28:55.888 --> 28:58.455
And were you with your mother?

28:58.457 --> 29:00.389
No, that was a lie.

29:01.026 --> 29:02.259
Exactly.

29:03.087 --> 29:05.329
Now, did someone tell you to lie?

29:05.331 --> 29:07.097
Did your mother tell you to lie?

29:07.099 --> 29:08.699
No, it was my idea.

29:08.701 --> 29:11.234
I had just lost my father,
and the thought of my mother

29:11.236 --> 29:12.860
spending the rest of her life
in prison...

29:13.694 --> 29:14.838
I just did it again, didn't I?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.940
It's okay. You're tired.

29:16.942 --> 29:18.342
And we've been doing this a while.

29:18.344 --> 29:19.576
But you get the idea, right?

29:19.578 --> 29:21.445
Yeah, I do.

29:23.282 --> 29:26.083
So, who's the parent and who's the child

29:26.085 --> 29:27.617
in the Lexington house?

29:27.619 --> 29:29.126
What do you mean?

29:30.889 --> 29:32.923
You're very protective of your mother.

29:32.925 --> 29:35.158
She's on trial for murder.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.594
No, I-I get that, but it strikes me

29:37.596 --> 29:39.796
as something that you've grown
comfortable with,

29:39.798 --> 29:42.766
something that you've been doing
for a long time.

29:43.932 --> 29:45.046
Ever since I can remember,

29:45.048 --> 29:46.670
my mother's been one of those people

29:46.672 --> 29:51.441
that everyone thinks they know,
even if they've never met her.

29:51.443 --> 29:54.411
They just instantly dislike her.

29:55.980 --> 29:59.031
You can't help but feel
protective of someone like that.

30:00.449 --> 30:03.487
People are just against her,
for no reason.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.123
You ever been on
the receiving end of that?

30:06.955 --> 30:09.791
Actually, I'm going through
something like that right now.

30:10.295 --> 30:13.296
This law professor of mine, I mean...

30:13.298 --> 30:15.532
he-he's just got it in for me.

30:15.534 --> 30:17.094
Every paper, every test.

30:17.096 --> 30:19.703
Yeah, but, I mean, at least
you can confront him.

30:19.705 --> 30:21.405
You can ask him why.

30:24.009 --> 30:25.349
You're right.

30:25.863 --> 30:28.697
I can. I should.

30:32.065 --> 30:34.691
And I think it's great that
you're your mother's protector.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.862
Becky, honey, I'm sorry.

30:39.330 --> 30:40.830
I know you're mad.

30:40.855 --> 30:42.324
I know you hate me.

30:42.861 --> 30:44.910
But you have to believe I love you.

30:45.430 --> 30:47.329
And you have to believe
I'm trying to make this...

30:48.200 --> 30:50.066
Becky, honey, I'm sorry.

30:50.068 --> 30:51.501
I know you're mad.

30:51.503 --> 30:53.703
I know you hate me.

30:53.705 --> 30:55.439
Can I show you something?

30:56.608 --> 30:58.708
I was able to get into
that website you got me.

30:58.710 --> 31:00.543
Turns out Jeremy had an account there.

31:00.545 --> 31:02.178
I think you should see this.

31:03.915 --> 31:06.616
Thank you for meeting me
before we go to court.

31:06.618 --> 31:08.577
Well, what's your big news?

31:08.579 --> 31:10.367
Did you find the person who did this?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.589
Because, let's be honest,

31:12.591 --> 31:17.360
short of that, I am not sensing
that we are going to prevail.

31:18.797 --> 31:20.904
Well...

31:21.199 --> 31:23.933
Actually, the folks who work
for me found a lot of things.

31:24.855 --> 31:25.802
For one,

31:25.804 --> 31:28.905
the website where your husband
did most of his gambling...

31:28.907 --> 31:31.608
turns out they traffic
in a variety of vices,

31:31.610 --> 31:35.211
all sorts of illicit
and illegal activities.

31:35.585 --> 31:37.314
I'm not following you.

31:38.422 --> 31:41.842
He didn't gamble away
your daughter's tuition money.

31:42.754 --> 31:44.554
He bought something with it.

31:45.679 --> 31:47.223
What?

31:48.223 --> 31:51.628
A future for you and your daughter.

31:51.630 --> 31:53.296
At least that was the plan.

31:54.813 --> 31:58.001
I do not understand
a word you are saying.

31:58.003 --> 31:59.985
Well, then...

32:00.739 --> 32:02.605
let's begin at the beginning.

32:02.607 --> 32:06.376
First and foremost, the police
and the prosecutor got it right.

32:06.378 --> 32:08.244
The crime scene was staged.

32:08.577 --> 32:09.946
By whom?

32:09.948 --> 32:11.915
The one person who was determined

32:11.917 --> 32:14.718
to see your husband's life end.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.252
Your husband.

32:18.357 --> 32:20.505
What are you trying to tell us?

32:21.423 --> 32:25.462
I'm trying to tell you
your husband committed suicide.

32:27.132 --> 32:29.599
Jason, that's impossible.

32:29.601 --> 32:31.634
The coroner would've
been able to determine

32:31.636 --> 32:33.570
if it was a self-inflicted wound.

32:33.572 --> 32:36.673
I mean, clearly, the bullet
came from a greater distance.

32:36.675 --> 32:38.908
Clearly, it came from someone else's gun.

32:38.910 --> 32:40.108
It did.

32:40.946 --> 32:43.646
That's why the scene seemed staged.

32:43.648 --> 32:47.183
The person who shot your husband
wasn't a robber.

32:47.185 --> 32:50.153
It was a professional hit man,
bought and paid for

32:50.155 --> 32:52.322
by his intended victim.

32:55.582 --> 32:56.926
Why?

32:56.928 --> 32:59.863
I'm guessing he realized
the perilous financial situation

32:59.865 --> 33:01.965
he'd put you and your daughter in.

33:01.967 --> 33:03.900
And the only real asset you had

33:03.902 --> 33:06.302
was the $25 million insurance policy.

33:06.304 --> 33:09.638
Which we could not collect on
if he died by his own hand.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.642
So he hired someone to do it for him.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.477
Exactly.

33:16.114 --> 33:19.749
And, of course...
they had to make it look like

33:19.751 --> 33:21.851
something other than what it was.

33:24.694 --> 33:27.357
Last night, I kept listening
to the voice mail

33:27.359 --> 33:29.658
Jeremy left you the night he died.

33:31.129 --> 33:34.079
Prosecutor keeps trying
to sell it to the jury

33:35.038 --> 33:37.000
like it's a plea for mercy,

33:37.002 --> 33:39.536
suggesting he knows
you're gonna kill him.

33:41.406 --> 33:43.171
That's not what I hear.

33:45.444 --> 33:47.544
He's asking for your forgiveness.

33:48.385 --> 33:49.845
For what he did.

33:50.182 --> 33:52.222
For what he's about to do.

33:56.143 --> 33:57.787
It's a suicide note.

34:02.357 --> 34:03.726
I know it's gonna be difficult,

34:03.728 --> 34:06.296
but we have to find a way
to get this out in court,

34:06.298 --> 34:08.264
and I may need you to take the stand.

34:08.266 --> 34:10.782
I think it's the only way
we can clear your name.

34:18.206 --> 34:19.416
No.

34:24.379 --> 34:26.014
We are not sharing this with anyone.

34:27.340 --> 34:28.184
What?

34:28.186 --> 34:31.011
That-that makes no sense, Rebecca.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.255
This conversation is protected

34:33.257 --> 34:35.158
by attorney-client privilege, right?

34:35.724 --> 34:36.826
Of course.

34:36.828 --> 34:40.897
And if I tell you you can't use
something, you can't, right?

34:40.899 --> 34:42.599
Rebecca, we're trying to save your life.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.833
We're trying to keep you out of prison.

34:44.835 --> 34:47.110
The insurance policy.

34:48.152 --> 34:50.440
Olivia is the secondary beneficiary.

34:50.442 --> 34:53.992
And if they find out that
this is essentially a suicide...

34:55.246 --> 34:58.038
they will never pay the claim, and she...

34:58.717 --> 35:02.018
If I go to prison,
my daughter will get the money,

35:02.020 --> 35:04.053
and my daughter will have a future.

35:04.055 --> 35:06.338
And she deserves a future.

35:10.175 --> 35:12.729
So the truth stays here.

35:14.638 --> 35:16.097
With us.

35:25.279 --> 35:28.613
Professor Jameson?

35:28.710 --> 35:31.010
I'm in your Intro to Legal Theory class.

35:31.012 --> 35:32.578
Do you have a minute?

35:32.580 --> 35:34.847
I see students only by appointment.

35:34.849 --> 35:36.516
I completely understand.

35:36.518 --> 35:39.652
But I work during the day,
and scheduling an appointment

35:39.654 --> 35:41.654
during your office hours is difficult.

35:41.957 --> 35:43.089
As it happens, my firm

35:43.091 --> 35:45.491
is in court today, so
I was able to sneak away.

35:45.493 --> 35:46.726
You work for a law firm?

35:46.728 --> 35:48.227
Trial science company.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.229
Oh, you're him.

35:50.840 --> 35:54.067
I wrote about it
in one of our first assignments.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.054
You gave me a "C."

35:56.604 --> 35:59.539
You give me a "C" on pretty much
everything I submit to you.

35:59.541 --> 36:01.741
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

36:02.944 --> 36:05.882
- Okay. Plead your case.
- Excuse me?

36:05.884 --> 36:08.948
Why do you think you're entitled
to more than a "C"?

36:09.401 --> 36:11.784
Because I see you
handing out "A"s and "B"s

36:11.786 --> 36:14.087
to almost everyone else
in the class, and...

36:14.089 --> 36:16.789
well, I... frankly, I have more
experience than any of them.

36:16.791 --> 36:19.525
At a trial science company?

36:20.537 --> 36:21.861
Well, why do you say it like that?

36:21.863 --> 36:24.697
Mr. Palmer, the system of jurisprudence

36:24.699 --> 36:26.733
has existed for centuries,

36:26.735 --> 36:28.701
functioning quite well
with just attorneys

36:28.703 --> 36:32.972
and, uh, and judges
and occasionally juries,

36:33.258 --> 36:35.424
never once requiring the services

36:35.426 --> 36:37.977
of trial scientists,
who, near as I can tell,

36:37.979 --> 36:40.880
just, uh, suddenly appeared
in the last 25 years.

36:41.224 --> 36:42.648
And who are they?

36:42.650 --> 36:45.885
They don't need degrees,
just a fancy business card,

36:45.887 --> 36:49.211
the ability to generate billable hours,

36:49.213 --> 36:50.556
uh, the gift of gab.

36:50.558 --> 36:54.026
Whenever a client prevails,
they take the credit.

36:54.028 --> 36:57.764
Whenever a client loses,
it's the attorney's fault.

36:59.601 --> 37:01.801
I think they're charlatans.

37:01.803 --> 37:05.875
And I think people who
work for them are charlatans.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.039
You don't even know me.

37:07.041 --> 37:10.409
I don't need to know you.
I know what you do.

37:10.411 --> 37:12.478
And I don't think that's fair.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.680
I came here to study the law.

37:14.682 --> 37:16.315
Shouldn't matter what job I have.

37:16.317 --> 37:19.218
If you don't like me
or you don't like my class,

37:19.220 --> 37:20.787
then drop out.

37:22.140 --> 37:23.289
I don't want to drop out.

37:23.291 --> 37:25.810
Then make your peace with those "C" s.

37:26.628 --> 37:28.327
Our appointment's over.

37:34.235 --> 37:37.436
Hey. I'm sorry that it took me
so long to get here,

37:37.438 --> 37:39.672
but... I know you said
it was an emergency...

37:39.674 --> 37:41.107
it's an hour on the train.

37:41.743 --> 37:43.276
I need your help.

37:43.278 --> 37:46.879
I have proof of your
mother's innocence, proof...

37:46.881 --> 37:48.915
she won't let me use
in court, and I suspect

37:48.917 --> 37:51.517
you may be the only one who
can convince her otherwise.

37:51.920 --> 37:52.819
Yeah.

37:53.296 --> 37:54.854
Yeah, of course, let me at her.

37:56.216 --> 37:59.458
Thing is, it's gonna
cost you $25 million.

38:01.179 --> 38:02.728
Your Honor, we would like to call

38:02.730 --> 38:05.100
a last-minute witness to the stand.

38:05.934 --> 38:07.366
Rebecca Lexington.

38:13.066 --> 38:14.717
<i>We met in college.</i>

38:14.719 --> 38:16.752
Fell in love. I was the poor girl

38:16.754 --> 38:18.287
from the other side of the tracks,

38:18.289 --> 38:20.456
and he was the rich boy
who deserved better.

38:20.458 --> 38:22.033
But we didn't care.

38:22.760 --> 38:24.953
We knew we were meant to be.

38:27.098 --> 38:29.398
His family held their noses
through our wedding,

38:29.400 --> 38:31.167
and he loved that.

38:31.501 --> 38:33.056
I loved him,

38:33.058 --> 38:36.172
but he had a dark side.

38:36.908 --> 38:41.410
If something was... forbidden,
he was very attracted to it.

38:41.412 --> 38:44.597
I think I was part of that...
till I wasn't.

38:45.016 --> 38:47.950
And when I wasn't, it became gambling.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.052
He was addicted.

38:50.854 --> 38:52.588
He loved the risk,

38:52.590 --> 38:54.590
and there were times that I was convinced

38:54.592 --> 38:58.427
that he found the losing
more thrilling than the winning.

38:58.429 --> 39:02.571
Did Jeremy ever tell you
how he felt about his addiction?

39:02.573 --> 39:03.600
Of course.

39:03.602 --> 39:07.454
He... more than anything, felt guilty.

39:08.121 --> 39:10.773
For everything he put us
through, especially Olivia.

39:12.431 --> 39:13.531
Any movement yet?

39:13.533 --> 39:15.511
You'll be the first to know.

39:15.513 --> 39:17.012
Mrs. Lexington,

39:17.014 --> 39:19.698
six months before your husband's death,

39:19.698 --> 39:22.566
were you aware that
he took out an insurance policy

39:22.568 --> 39:24.804
of $25 million,

39:25.170 --> 39:28.138
naming you as the primary beneficiary?

39:29.074 --> 39:30.774
He mentioned the policy,
but I had no idea

39:30.776 --> 39:33.043
it was for that much
until after his death.

39:33.045 --> 39:36.179
Did you know that,
in the event of suicide,

39:36.566 --> 39:39.149
this policy would be null and void?

39:39.527 --> 39:42.686
I never saw the policy.
I have no idea what it said.

39:42.688 --> 39:44.321
Don't touch that dial.

39:44.323 --> 39:45.989
Here comes the good part.

39:45.991 --> 39:48.325
Do you know a Donald Graham?

39:48.327 --> 39:50.293
- No, I don't.
- Were you aware

39:50.295 --> 39:52.963
that your husband transferred $20,000,

39:52.965 --> 39:56.099
two days before he died, to Mr. Graham?

39:56.101 --> 39:57.400
No.

39:57.402 --> 40:00.504
So you had no idea what
this payment was actually for?

40:00.506 --> 40:01.838
None at all.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.206
Is this the good part?

40:03.208 --> 40:04.374
Patience.

40:04.376 --> 40:06.376
Did you know that Mr. Graham

40:06.378 --> 40:07.744
is a contract killer?

40:07.746 --> 40:09.212
A hit man?

40:09.214 --> 40:10.714
A professional executioner?

40:10.716 --> 40:11.781
Objection.

40:11.783 --> 40:12.849
No foundation.

40:12.851 --> 40:14.151
There is zero evidence...

40:14.153 --> 40:15.752
Actually, there is.

40:15.754 --> 40:17.154
I would like to submit

40:17.156 --> 40:19.756
evidence of a money trail,

40:19.758 --> 40:21.591
leading from Mr. Lexington

40:21.593 --> 40:23.760
to Mr. Graham, purchasing his services.

40:23.762 --> 40:24.928
Objection.

40:24.930 --> 40:26.496
This is the first we've heard of this.

40:26.498 --> 40:29.166
I'll take it de bene,

40:29.536 --> 40:31.955
assuming it will hold up later on.

40:33.873 --> 40:35.405
It's not spring yet, is it?

40:35.407 --> 40:36.840
Why do you say that?

40:36.842 --> 40:38.878
I'm seeing my first hint of green.

40:40.179 --> 40:41.845
Mrs. Lexington,

40:42.382 --> 40:46.149
is it possible
that your husband felt so guilty

40:46.151 --> 40:49.019
for the position that he had
put you and your daughter in

40:49.021 --> 40:51.621
that he would have
orchestrated his own murder?

40:51.623 --> 40:53.857
Objection. Calls for speculation.

40:53.859 --> 40:55.008
Sustained.

40:55.010 --> 40:56.855
Let me rephrase that.

40:58.064 --> 40:59.996
Your husband knew
that you and your daughter

40:59.998 --> 41:01.892
were in desperate need of money.

41:01.894 --> 41:03.576
We talked about that all the time.

41:03.578 --> 41:04.868
Objection. Hearsay.

41:04.870 --> 41:05.936
She is testifying

41:05.938 --> 41:07.904
to her part in a conversation.

41:07.906 --> 41:09.072
It's not hearsay.

41:09.074 --> 41:10.140
Overruled.

41:10.702 --> 41:12.242
Mrs. Lexington,

41:12.244 --> 41:13.843
can you think of any other reason

41:13.845 --> 41:16.146
that your husband
would go onto the dark web

41:16.148 --> 41:18.515
- and hire a professional killer?
- No.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.642
Your Honor, that is pure speculation.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.586
Jury will disregard.

41:22.588 --> 41:23.587
No, they won't.

41:23.589 --> 41:25.055
Just one more question, Your Honor.

41:25.057 --> 41:29.359
Mrs. Lexington, you do understand

41:29.804 --> 41:31.695
that your testimony here today

41:31.697 --> 41:35.332
will almost certainly result
in the insurance company

41:35.334 --> 41:38.568
declaring your husband's death a suicide,

41:38.570 --> 41:41.104
and thereby allowing them

41:41.106 --> 41:44.107
to opt out of any payment
to you or your daughter?

41:44.109 --> 41:46.112
Yes, I do.

41:47.145 --> 41:48.912
And I don't care.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.686
Oh, my goodness.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.188
It's like Saint Paddy's Day in here.

42:01.260 --> 42:04.427
On the single count
of murder in the first degree,

42:04.429 --> 42:05.829
we, the jury,

42:05.831 --> 42:09.599
find the defendant, Rebecca Lexington...

42:09.601 --> 42:11.167
not guilty.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.710
No hard feelings, Theresa?

42:22.712 --> 42:24.481
Can't promise you that.

42:24.483 --> 42:27.450
But send me the evidence you've
gathered on Donald Graham,

42:27.452 --> 42:29.886
and I'll have my office
seek an indictment immediately.

42:29.888 --> 42:31.087
Okay.

42:36.329 --> 42:37.327
Watch.

42:37.329 --> 42:39.829
Bet she's the only one that's
gonna make any money on this.

42:39.831 --> 42:41.998
It's probably as it should be,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.567
given all the help she gave me.

42:44.569 --> 42:46.536
Do me a favor.

42:46.538 --> 42:48.571
Give her a couple hours of your time.

42:48.573 --> 42:50.940
And let's both convince
your client to do the same.

42:50.942 --> 42:54.411
She saved our asses today,
not to mention Rebecca's life.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.746
Nice work, chief.

42:56.748 --> 42:58.481
Yes, we did it.

42:58.483 --> 43:00.750
- Yeah.
- Kept our client out of jail.

43:00.752 --> 43:03.219
- Yes.
- Of course, now she's bankrupt.

43:03.221 --> 43:04.554
Can't pay her oil bill.

43:04.556 --> 43:06.022
Can't pay her daughter's tuition.

43:06.024 --> 43:08.224
Can't pay us.

43:08.226 --> 43:11.294
It's like I told Charlie Sheen
a couple years ago:

43:11.296 --> 43:14.297
winning isn't everything
it's cracked up to be.
