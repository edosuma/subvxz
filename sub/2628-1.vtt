00:48.888 --> 00:51.479
[match ignition]

01:52.519 --> 01:54.385
[NARRATOR]
There's a story that has been

01:54.385 --> 01:56.818
passed down for centuries,

01:56.819 --> 01:58.876
from father to son.

02:00.619 --> 02:03.518
Legend has it a
certain man came

02:03.519 --> 02:06.383
to live in the
village of Gladbury.

02:07.985 --> 02:10.217
He was a good-hearted man,

02:10.219 --> 02:14.311
devoted to his
family and his craft.

02:15.285 --> 02:19.614
The candle maker brought
light to the entire village.

02:20.352 --> 02:23.051
But he longed to give them more.

02:23.052 --> 02:25.384
Life was hard in Gladbury,

02:25.384 --> 02:29.339
and the people had
become disheartened.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.550
[NARRATOR] Night and day,
the candle maker worked,

02:34.551 --> 02:39.506
pouring his heart and
his prayers into each candle.

02:39.718 --> 02:41.784
But on the first
Sunday of Advent,

02:41.785 --> 02:47.351
all he had left to give...
was a single prayer,

02:47.351 --> 02:54.550
not for himself, but for
Gladbury, for his son,

02:54.550 --> 02:58.448
and for all the sons
and daughters to come.

03:00.450 --> 03:06.474
Silence was the only answer
he would receive that night.

03:08.150 --> 03:10.673
Or so it seemed.

04:03.782 --> 04:08.510
[NARRATOR] An angel
blessed a single candle.

04:10.215 --> 04:14.948
The heavenly gift was given
to the ones who needed it most,

04:14.948 --> 04:17.380
with the simple instruction:

04:17.380 --> 04:21.177
Light this and pray.

04:28.014 --> 04:31.646
[NARRATOR] The children
hoped for an answered prayer.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.980
But what they
received was a miracle.

04:34.981 --> 04:37.613
On Christmas Eve,
the village rejoiced

04:37.614 --> 04:41.047
upon hearing of
their change of fortune,

04:41.048 --> 04:43.547
for such things do happen.

04:43.547 --> 04:47.309
And from them, legends are born.

04:47.947 --> 04:51.447
As the tale is told,
every twenty-five years,

04:51.447 --> 04:54.380
the angel visits
The Haddington Chandlery,

04:54.380 --> 04:58.142
and every time
a prayer is answered.

05:01.613 --> 05:06.012
But even the greatest
stories must come to an end.

05:06.613 --> 05:09.879
Much has changed
in two hundred years.

05:09.880 --> 05:13.437
In a world illuminated
by modern marvels,

05:14.013 --> 05:18.536
who needs the
light of a simple candle?

05:19.513 --> 05:24.502
[bustling about and voices]

05:26.179 --> 05:27.546
[YOUNG BOY]
I'm starving.

05:27.546 --> 05:30.341
[ABNER]
How are you'! Hello.

05:34.545 --> 05:35.645
[ABNER]
How we doing'! Alright?

05:35.645 --> 05:37.045
[DAVID]
Yeah, very good, yeah.

05:37.046 --> 05:39.274
Hope they'll be bringing
some more soon.

05:39.378 --> 05:40.978
[ABNER]
Bless you little lady.

05:40.979 --> 05:43.545
[GIRL]
ls it soup again'!

05:43.545 --> 05:45.670
[ABNER]
God bless you, sir.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.345
[MISS FOSTER] There's no
longer a place for you here!

05:47.345 --> 05:47.978
[RUTH]
Please!

05:47.979 --> 05:49.511
[MISS FOSTER] I'm sorry,
but there's nothing I can do.

05:49.512 --> 05:51.671
Orders came straight
from the top.

05:52.712 --> 05:54.111
[MISS FOSTER]
You should learn to keep your

05:54.112 --> 05:57.374
affections to yourself,
Ruth Goodchild!

06:07.945 --> 06:11.105
[MISS FOSTER] And don't even
think about coming back!

06:13.845 --> 06:15.209
[WOMAN PASSERBY]
Serves you right.

06:17.778 --> 06:22.006
[Ruth begins to weep]

06:23.478 --> 06:26.137
Abner, will you take
over for a second?

06:26.444 --> 06:29.035
Yes. God bless you, sir.

06:34.311 --> 06:39.311
[Ruth weeping]

06:39.311 --> 06:40.537
Hello, miss.

06:41.877 --> 06:43.104
Miss.

06:43.144 --> 06:45.007
What do you want'!

06:45.376 --> 06:47.172
I only mean to help.

07:04.143 --> 07:06.473
[DAVID] It's no Buckingham
Palace, Miss Goodchild.

07:07.210 --> 07:08.976
But you'll be safe here.

07:08.976 --> 07:11.443
And with three meals
a day, you won't go hungry.

07:11.443 --> 07:15.205
When the baby comes, what then'!

07:15.375 --> 07:16.875
Well, perhaps there's someone...

07:16.876 --> 07:20.308
No.There's nobody.

07:20.309 --> 07:22.609
Or rather there was,
but he found someone else

07:22.609 --> 07:24.837
and dismissed me
from work today.

07:28.008 --> 07:29.641
[DAVID]
Don't lose hope, miss.

07:29.642 --> 07:32.608
We'll find a place
for you and your baby.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.708
[ABNER]
God bless you, sir.

08:05.708 --> 08:06.840
[LADY CAMDON]
Reverend Richmond?

08:06.841 --> 08:07.974
Friend of yours?

08:07.974 --> 08:09.107
I have no idea.

08:09.108 --> 08:10.640
God bless you.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.936
Reverend David Richmond.

08:13.674 --> 08:15.774
So you really
have left the pulpit.

08:15.774 --> 08:18.174
Nonsense.This is my pulpit now.

08:18.174 --> 08:20.873
Soup, soap, and salvation.

08:20.874 --> 08:23.305
And please,
I'm only known as David here.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.806
Have we met?

08:24.807 --> 08:28.306
We might have, had you not
rejected my last three letters.

08:28.307 --> 08:32.607
Ah, yes, Lady Camdon
of Gladbury, in the flesh.

08:32.607 --> 08:35.273
But I'm sorry that you've
traveled so far only

08:35.273 --> 08:37.804
to hear me decline your
offer once again.

08:37.806 --> 08:41.000
My place is here,
helping the needy.

08:42.140 --> 08:45.206
You, sir, have you
heard this man preach?

08:45.207 --> 08:46.706
Can't say that I have.

08:46.706 --> 08:48.806
[LADY CAMDON] Villagers
flocked to London to hear him.

08:48.806 --> 08:51.039
I once sat by a fisherman
who rode his boat

08:51.040 --> 08:53.339
twelve miles for one sermon.

08:53.339 --> 08:54.806
It was along time ago.

08:54.806 --> 08:56.362
But I'll never forget.

08:58.272 --> 09:01.102
David Richmond, miracle man.

09:01.172 --> 09:03.305
In the midst of
my own great loss,

09:03.306 --> 09:06.931
it was your words
that revived my faith.

09:07.806 --> 09:11.639
Any able bodied man
can serve a bowl of soup,

09:11.639 --> 09:14.605
but few men have
a gift like yours.

09:16.839 --> 09:20.306
My only hope is that
you choose to serve

09:20.306 --> 09:23.533
where your gift is needed most.

09:25.772 --> 09:26.872
God bless you.

09:26.872 --> 09:28.337
[BOY] Thank you very much, sir.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.269
[ABNER] Perhaps you
should think about it, David.

09:38.371 --> 09:41.360
[ABNER]
God bless you.Well done, sir.

09:41.705 --> 09:43.471
[ABNER]
That's it, take a bowl.

09:43.472 --> 09:45.267
Sorry.

09:49.771 --> 09:53.171
[DAVID] Dear Lady Camdon,
your recent visit was a

09:53.171 --> 09:56.970
timely reminder of
the life I left behind.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.603
Though tragedy has
altered my course,

09:59.604 --> 10:02.866
I can no longer stray from
my calling in the pulpit.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.269
I humbly accept the offer
to serve your parish in the

10:06.270 --> 10:09.202
place of the late
Reverend Pillington.

10:09.804 --> 10:13.836
I shall arrive in Gladbury
the Friday before Advent.

10:13.837 --> 10:17.031
Yours truly, David Richmond.

10:21.970 --> 10:22.970
[EMILY]
Come on, boy!

10:22.970 --> 10:25.636
Come on! Move on!

10:25.636 --> 10:27.370
You silly old thing. Come on!

10:27.370 --> 10:29.268
Move on!

10:29.703 --> 10:31.328
Come on!

10:34.369 --> 10:36.335
Might I offer you
some assistance?

10:36.336 --> 10:39.598
Thank you, I'm quite capable!

10:42.269 --> 10:44.269
Well, if it wouldn't be too
forward of me, I could--

10:44.269 --> 10:45.530
[EMILY]
No!

10:45.869 --> 10:48.427
I'm not a sack of potatoes.

10:50.169 --> 10:51.499
Come on!

10:52.436 --> 10:55.163
[EMILY]
Come on, boy. Come on!

10:57.269 --> 10:59.167
[EMILY]
I don't need your help.

10:59.469 --> 11:01.662
[DAVID]
Come on. Come on.

11:02.602 --> 11:04.125
Come on.

11:13.802 --> 11:15.468
[DAVID] And where are
you headed, miss'!

11:15.469 --> 11:17.035
Miss Barstow.

11:17.035 --> 11:19.502
I'm headed to London
by way of Gladbury.

11:19.502 --> 11:21.001
And the people of Gladbury,

11:21.001 --> 11:22.967
they allow a lady to
venture on her own'!

11:22.968 --> 11:25.600
It's the Christmas season.
The whole town's in a fuss.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.301
[DAVID] But Christmas
isn't for weeks.

11:27.302 --> 11:28.968
[EMILY] I take it you've
never been to Gladbury.

11:28.968 --> 11:30.168
Is it really so bad?

11:30.168 --> 11:31.634
It is.

11:31.634 --> 11:33.657
[DAVID]Whoa,
steady boy. Come on!

11:34.035 --> 11:37.467
Come on, come on, come on!

11:37.968 --> 11:40.367
Whoa.Whoa.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.633
[EMILY] Especially
this Christmas

11:41.634 --> 11:44.033
with the new minister
set to arrive.

11:44.034 --> 11:47.267
Reverend High and
Mighty from London.

11:47.267 --> 11:49.600
I hope they dislike
him very much.

11:49.601 --> 11:53.033
Thank you. I hate to be indebted
to anyone, much less a stranger.

11:53.034 --> 11:55.167
It's an easy debt to forgive.

11:55.167 --> 11:58.361
"Reverend High and
Mighty" at your service.

11:59.367 --> 12:02.466
Reverend. How providential.

12:02.467 --> 12:04.366
Oh, we shall see.

12:05.301 --> 12:07.500
Might you have
any words of advice?

12:07.500 --> 12:08.659
Yes.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.459
Retreat.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.432
Walk on.

12:14.433 --> 12:17.099
Very well then.
I look forward to

12:17.100 --> 12:19.033
seeing you at
church on Sunday!

12:19.033 --> 12:20.666
[Emily laughs]

12:20.667 --> 12:22.792
Walk on.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.499
[EDWARD]
Thank you Ebenezer.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.999
<i>REM Hurry up, Edward.</i>

12:30.999 --> 12:32.798
We don't want the new
minister thinking the

12:32.799 --> 12:35.856
Haddingtons are a pair
of village bumpkins.

12:36.300 --> 12:39.166
Codswallop my dear,
you look lovely.

12:39.166 --> 12:42.798
I come from a long line of
bumpkins, and I'm proud of it.

12:42.799 --> 12:46.322
Who wouldn't love
Gladbury at Christmas?

12:48.165 --> 12:49.426
[MAN]
He's here!

12:53.466 --> 12:54.931
[GIRLS]
There he is!

12:55.165 --> 12:58.790
[villagers greet David]

13:06.099 --> 13:07.655
[crowd gasps]

13:11.598 --> 13:13.264
Hello.

13:13.264 --> 13:15.787
[HERBERT] Alright gentlefolk,
make some space.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.461
Oh here, allow me.

13:20.932 --> 13:23.531
Herbert Hopewell,
at your service.

13:23.531 --> 13:25.759
Me and the Missus'll
be looking after you.

13:26.031 --> 13:29.097
[DAVID] Oh.Thank you,
but I can manage.

13:29.098 --> 13:30.996
Not while I'm still breathing.

13:31.465 --> 13:34.192
Reverend Richmond,
welcome to Gladbury.

13:34.431 --> 13:37.464
I'm Bea Haddington,
and this is my Edward.

13:37.465 --> 13:39.192
Edward Haddington.

13:39.630 --> 13:42.153
Of Haddington Chandlery.

13:42.831 --> 13:45.422
Home of the Christmas Candle...'!

13:46.630 --> 13:48.255
<i>Um.</i>

13:51.831 --> 13:56.092
Oh, you haven't heard of us.

13:56.664 --> 13:58.163
That's alright,
you'll have a chance

13:58.163 --> 14:00.322
to meet the reverend
soon enough.

14:00.530 --> 14:02.162
Lovely to see you.

14:02.163 --> 14:03.263
All of you!

14:03.263 --> 14:05.126
Let's see the church, eh?

14:07.130 --> 14:09.823
[church bells ring]
[organ playing]

14:13.263 --> 14:18.829
[ELEANOR] â™ª On a starry
night in Bethlehem, â™ª

14:18.830 --> 14:24.329
â™ª A child was born
to bring light to men. â™ª

14:24.329 --> 14:29.762
â™ª And our faith waned,
our eyes grew dim â™ª

14:29.763 --> 14:36.529
â™ª In a candle's light
we found hope again. â™ª

14:36.529 --> 14:38.328
There are miracles
all around,

14:38.329 --> 14:40.028
Are you alright?

14:40.029 --> 14:43.517
[HERBERT] There she is,
a special soul.

14:43.962 --> 14:47.828
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

14:47.829 --> 14:50.428
Sometimes I think
I'm hearing an angel.

14:50.428 --> 14:53.194
â™ª Hid in every heart is
an answered prayer. â™ª

14:53.195 --> 14:55.627
That's my <i>lady...</i>
Eleanor.

14:56.128 --> 15:03.755
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

15:08.028 --> 15:09.660
[ELEANOR] Off with
that muddy coat!

15:09.661 --> 15:12.093
Did you crawl all
the way from London?

15:16.994 --> 15:18.294
[ELEANOR]
Come on, britches too.

15:18.295 --> 15:20.927
You're not the first clergyman
I've seen in his underpants.

15:20.928 --> 15:22.587
[Herbert laughs]

15:25.128 --> 15:26.923
[Eleanor giggles]

15:31.360 --> 15:33.292
[ELEANOR]
I'll just get these cleaned up.

15:35.828 --> 15:37.327
[Eleanor giggles]

15:37.327 --> 15:40.826
Weâ€™re just across the
garden if you need us.

15:40.827 --> 15:42.860
Anything at all.

15:42.860 --> 15:45.486
Welcome to Gladbury, Reverend.

15:47.461 --> 15:51.793
Jesus said, "Ye are
the light of the world."

15:51.793 --> 15:55.859
A city that is set on
a hill cannot be hid.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.758
[parishioner coughs]

16:00.159 --> 16:05.683
Neither do men light a candle
and put it under a bushel,

16:06.293 --> 16:08.486
But on a candlestick.

16:08.693 --> 16:12.682
And it giveth light unto
all that are in the house.

16:13.926 --> 16:16.687
Let your light
so shine before men.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.492
That they may
see your good works.

16:20.492 --> 16:23.758
And glorify your Father,
which is in Heaven.

16:23.759 --> 16:25.691
Thank you Reverend.

16:27.258 --> 16:29.125
Is he talking about
our Christmas Candle?

16:29.126 --> 16:30.358
I think he's gettin' to it.

16:30.358 --> 16:31.756
[DAVID]
You sir!

16:31.859 --> 16:34.959
Would you hide this
candle under a bushel?

16:34.959 --> 16:36.591
No sir, I wouldn't.

16:36.592 --> 16:37.825
Of course not.

16:37.826 --> 16:40.125
And you, Mrs. Haddington?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.023
Would you conceal
this candle under your hat?

16:44.525 --> 16:46.124
Lovely as it is.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.818
[BEA]
No, no, never.

16:48.525 --> 16:51.157
[DAVID] Candles
belong on candlesticks,

16:51.158 --> 16:53.991
giving light to everyone.

16:53.991 --> 16:56.657
[DAVID]
What then is this light

16:56.658 --> 16:59.783
that draws men to
our Heavenly Father?

16:59.991 --> 17:05.855
Is it signs and wonders'!
Angels and miracles?

17:09.491 --> 17:11.290
[DAVID]
Of course not!

17:12.357 --> 17:16.856
[DAVID] It is our good works
that shine before men

17:16.857 --> 17:19.789
and glorify our
Father in Heaven.

17:22.589 --> 17:24.290
<i>No.</i>

17:24.290 --> 17:26.813
Not one word about
the Christmas Candle.

17:27.156 --> 17:29.452
Better luck next time.

17:30.356 --> 17:31.422
[LADY CAMDON]
Reverend Richmond.

17:31.423 --> 17:32.423
Lady Camdon.

17:32.423 --> 17:33.956
What a fascinating sermon.

17:33.957 --> 17:35.183
Thank you.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.356
And yet so unlike the sermons
for which you're loved.

17:39.356 --> 17:41.456
That's not to
worry you, Reverend.

17:41.457 --> 17:44.190
You'll do very
well here in Gladbury.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.247
I'll make sure of it.

17:51.789 --> 17:55.119
[DAVID] "An early Christmas gift
for you and all of Gladbury."

17:55.490 --> 17:57.323
This is quite unexpected.

17:57.323 --> 17:59.022
A gift from the
Countess of Gladbury!

17:59.023 --> 18:00.522
Whatever could it be?

18:00.522 --> 18:02.613
Whatever could it be, eh?

18:05.255 --> 18:08.321
Gladbury': most
beloved Advent sermons.

18:08.322 --> 18:09.845
Tried and true.

18:10.689 --> 18:13.655
[HERBERT] Some of these sermons
are two hundred years old.

18:15.489 --> 18:18.589
And I imagine her ladyship
expects me to use these sermons.

18:18.589 --> 18:21.121
Well, I can think of no
better way to preserve

18:21.122 --> 18:23.489
the legacy of the
Christmas Candle.

18:23.489 --> 18:26.322
Forgive my ignorance, but what
is this Christmas Candle?

18:26.322 --> 18:30.414
I think you'll find everything
you're looking for in here.

18:40.822 --> 18:42.515
[DAVID]
This is preposterous!

18:42.688 --> 18:45.245
I thought you might
stop by, Reverend.

18:45.521 --> 18:46.354
Tea?

18:46.354 --> 18:48.253
Had I known that the people
of this town were expecting

18:48.254 --> 18:49.754
to hear such fairy
tales from the pulpit,

18:49.755 --> 18:50.621
I never would have come!

18:50.621 --> 18:53.454
The Christmas Candle is
no fairy tale, I assure you.

18:53.455 --> 18:55.455
[DAVID] Oh, then I suppose
that you have seen

18:55.455 --> 18:57.488
this magical wish
granting angel'!

18:57.488 --> 18:58.612
<i>No.</i>

18:59.587 --> 19:01.281
But he has.

19:02.321 --> 19:05.653
[DAVID] Ah, yes,
the candle maker.

19:05.654 --> 19:07.754
Do I have some
questions for you.

19:07.754 --> 19:10.587
Why one Christmas Candle,
and not fifteen?

19:10.587 --> 19:12.820
Why doesn't this angel
come once every year?

19:12.821 --> 19:15.253
Or every Thursday
afternoon for tea?

19:15.253 --> 19:18.152
And why in all of God's
green Earth, Gladbury'!

19:18.153 --> 19:19.586
[EDWARD]
Why Bethlehem?

19:19.587 --> 19:21.486
Why a babe in a manger?

19:21.487 --> 19:24.520
Who could possibly hope to
understand the ways of the Lord'!

19:24.520 --> 19:26.419
But I see no reason to
promote superstitions

19:26.420 --> 19:27.420
or raise false hopes.

19:27.420 --> 19:30.186
[LADY CAMDON] People of
Gladbury lead difficult lives.

19:30.187 --> 19:33.584
Even the slightest hope of a
miracle keeps their faith alive.

19:34.153 --> 19:37.119
Only to be crushed when
their prayers go unanswered.

19:38.187 --> 19:39.519
If this is what your
people need, then I--

19:39.519 --> 19:41.819
[LADY CAMDON]
What our people need is hope.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.945
And you can give it to them.

19:44.519 --> 19:46.619
I know this firsthand.

19:46.619 --> 19:51.074
Lady Camdon, I'm not the
"miracle man" that you remember.

19:51.820 --> 19:54.149
Coming to Gladbury
was a mistake.

19:55.086 --> 19:56.919
[EDWARD] On that
we are in agreement.

19:56.919 --> 19:58.185
[LADY CAMDON]
But what if it were providence

19:58.186 --> 19:59.947
that brought you here?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.818
I think you should stay.

20:05.819 --> 20:08.119
[EDWARD]Why prolong
the inevitable?

20:08.119 --> 20:10.607
Just until Christmas.

20:11.351 --> 20:13.647
[LADY CAMDON]
This is the year.

20:14.919 --> 20:18.749
Please, David, consider it.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.609
[VICTORIA] Let's go
play in the garden.

20:24.618 --> 20:26.607
[BOY] Victoria, wait for me!

20:30.018 --> 20:32.484
[DAVID] I take it you're not
much of a horsewoman.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.683
[EMILY] If it isn't the
ever-helpful reverend.

20:37.684 --> 20:39.741
[DAVID]Well that depends
on who you're asking.

20:39.951 --> 20:42.318
I fear I have little to offer
the people of Gladbury.

20:42.318 --> 20:44.483
[EMILY] Don't pity
yourself, Reverend.

20:44.484 --> 20:47.416
Though I did warn you.
This town is mad.

20:48.151 --> 20:50.810
[DAVID] All their hopes
wrapped up in one candle.

20:51.084 --> 20:54.417
Oh, not just any candle,
the Christmas Candle.

20:54.417 --> 20:57.008
[DAVID] Miss Barstow, do I
detect an air of skepticism.

20:57.284 --> 20:59.250
[EMILY]The Christmas
Candle': no different than

20:59.250 --> 21:02.250
old wives' tales or
your Bible stories.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.182
Take no offense, Reverend.

21:05.683 --> 21:07.150
So you're not a believer then'!

21:07.150 --> 21:10.116
I'm a believer...
in common sense.

21:10.117 --> 21:14.243
If something seems too good to
be true, then most likely it is.

21:14.416 --> 21:16.178
They'll find out soon enough.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.349
In fifty years, will anyone
know what a candle is'!

21:19.349 --> 21:21.482
Doubtful, we've already
stepped into the

21:21.483 --> 21:23.483
Modern age in my father's shop,

21:23.483 --> 21:26.971
and I must say,
it's electrifying.

21:27.283 --> 21:29.316
"London Lamp 8' Electric"?

21:29.316 --> 21:31.416
[EMILY] The bane of Edward
Haddington': existence.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.748
And worse, founded
by his very own son.

21:33.749 --> 21:36.015
Of course.
Thomas Haddington.

21:36.016 --> 21:37.416
He's the Haddington':
only child,

21:37.416 --> 21:39.915
So the fairy tale ends with him.

21:39.916 --> 21:43.246
[DAVID]What's this for'!
ls this for the Christmas tree'!

21:44.416 --> 21:45.782
I envy him.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.348
He left Gladbury when
he had the chance.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.473
You'd be wise to do the same.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.776
[DAVID]
And what about you'?

21:52.016 --> 21:53.515
[EMILY] My time will come.

21:53.515 --> 21:57.447
When Father's health improves
and he can manage on his own.

21:57.682 --> 21:59.148
[DAVID] Perhaps
we'll find ourselves

21:59.148 --> 22:00.581
In London next Christmas.

22:00.582 --> 22:03.582
[EMILY] If you make it out
of Gladbury intact.

22:03.582 --> 22:07.014
â™ª Oh come all ye faithful. â™ª

22:07.015 --> 22:10.448
â™ª Joyful and triumphant. â™ª

22:10.449 --> 22:18.681
â™ª Oh come ye oh come
ye to Bethlehem. â™ª

22:18.681 --> 22:22.447
â™ª Come and behold Him, â™ª

22:22.448 --> 22:25.781
â™ª Born the king of angels. â™ª

22:25.781 --> 22:29.413
â™ª Oh come let us adore Him. â™ª

22:29.414 --> 22:33.580
â™ª Oh come let us adore Him. â™ª

22:33.581 --> 22:41.843
â™ª Oh come let us adore
Him, Christ the Lord. â™ª

22:41.980 --> 22:46.969
[citizens talking
and moving about]

22:48.947 --> 22:50.513
[WILLIAM] You must
be the new Reverend.

22:50.513 --> 22:52.411
I'm William Barstow.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.579
Illness kept me from
church on Sunday,

22:54.580 --> 22:58.580
but I've heard about you.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.944
Oh?

23:01.980 --> 23:04.646
My daughter told me the
new reverend is more

23:04.647 --> 23:06.847
than eager to lend
a helping hand,

23:06.847 --> 23:09.438
even if it does mean
wading through mud.

23:09.647 --> 23:12.976
Oh yes, the spirited
Miss Barstow.

23:15.346 --> 23:18.346
[WILLIAM] I've prayed for
something to bring

23:18.346 --> 23:20.445
my Emily back to the church.

23:20.446 --> 23:22.742
Here's hoping it's you.

23:26.946 --> 23:28.673
[WILLIAM] Do you
have your request?

23:28.913 --> 23:30.606
Go on then.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.912
[WILLIAM]
My nephew's a special boy.

23:35.913 --> 23:40.844
Lots of faith.Wants to
be a preacher, like you.

23:41.179 --> 23:42.512
[crowd oohs and awws]

23:42.512 --> 23:46.011
[EDWARD]
Ladies and gentlemen!

23:46.012 --> 23:52.112
Gentlefolks of Gladbury, welcome
to this very special night.

23:52.112 --> 23:56.411
Now feast your eyes on
the amazing, wondrous,

23:56.411 --> 24:01.778
mystical visions bestowed on
generations of Haddingtons.

24:01.778 --> 24:08.233
Gladbury': very
own Christmas Candle!

24:10.178 --> 24:12.511
[EDWARD]There's a story
that's been passed down

24:12.511 --> 24:16.603
for centuries from
father to son.

24:19.844 --> 24:24.177
On the first Sunday of Advent,
my great-great-great-grandfather

24:24.178 --> 24:26.410
was awakened by a
wondrous light.

24:26.410 --> 24:28.638
[WILLIAM] Poor boy's
parents died a few years back.

24:30.277 --> 24:32.402
We all have our stories.

24:33.144 --> 24:35.010
[WILLIAM] Everyone
here is holding out

24:35.011 --> 24:37.143
for the Christmas Candle.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.810
[crowd oohs and awws]

24:38.811 --> 24:40.610
And where's your request?

24:40.610 --> 24:42.476
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

24:42.477 --> 24:45.568
I'd much rather Charlie
receive the Candle.

24:50.410 --> 24:52.642
[WILLIAM]
Will you be joining us?

24:52.643 --> 24:56.666
[DAVID] Not tonight. I believe
I have a sermon to prepare.

24:58.177 --> 25:01.310
[EDWARD] And so he gave the
first Christmas Candle to orphan

25:01.310 --> 25:05.642
children with Gladbury':
most beloved instruction:

25:05.643 --> 25:08.609
light this and pray.

25:08.910 --> 25:11.409
[ELEANOR] â™ª Hid in every
heart is an answered prayer. â™ª

25:11.409 --> 25:16.569
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

25:18.009 --> 25:19.842
Yes, yes, I know the song.

25:19.842 --> 25:22.502
But we won't
be singing it today.

25:23.675 --> 25:26.342
It's the first Sunday in Advent,
we sing it every year.

25:26.342 --> 25:28.103
But it's tradition.

25:30.309 --> 25:33.608
Well, we'll just make
some new traditions, eh?

25:33.608 --> 25:36.972
We're just grateful we've
got a reverend in the pulpit.

25:37.442 --> 25:39.608
Well, I hope you
won't refuse my lady's

25:39.608 --> 25:42.597
other favorite
Christmas tradition.

25:46.842 --> 25:50.239
Gladbury': very own
Christmas Chasuble.

26:10.674 --> 26:12.162
Welcome.

26:13.274 --> 26:17.007
The first candle of Advent
is the candle of hope.

26:17.007 --> 26:18.939
But hope in what?

26:19.774 --> 26:22.607
An answered prayer? A miracle?

26:22.607 --> 26:24.607
A Christmas Candle?

26:24.607 --> 26:26.672
I'm told that tonight
marks the return

26:26.673 --> 26:29.173
of this remarkable tradition.

26:29.174 --> 26:31.571
Isn't that right Mr. Haddington?

26:33.973 --> 26:35.639
Yes, it is.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.573
[DAVID] And I'm sure
that you know this,

26:37.573 --> 26:43.472
But for my benefit, who here has
put in a request for the candle?

26:46.339 --> 26:48.138
[DAVID]Well,
surely not everyone

26:48.139 --> 26:50.172
can receive the
Christmas Candle.

26:50.173 --> 26:52.106
And yet we all have needs.

26:52.106 --> 26:54.231
So what hope do we have?

26:55.106 --> 26:57.805
Will we abandon our faith?

26:57.806 --> 26:59.931
Fall into despair?

27:00.473 --> 27:04.139
Hm'! I hope not.

27:04.139 --> 27:07.128
And I dare say
that we will not!

27:07.572 --> 27:11.838
We light this candle to remind
us that our hope does not

27:11.839 --> 27:15.931
come from earthly things,
but from above.

27:16.939 --> 27:21.305
From the God who came to us
one starry night in Bethlehem,

27:21.305 --> 27:23.772
and promises to
come again one day.

27:23.772 --> 27:26.805
And that,
good people of Gladbury,

27:26.806 --> 27:28.771
is miracle enough.

27:28.771 --> 27:31.135
[93335]

27:36.138 --> 27:37.271
God bless you.

27:37.272 --> 27:38.931
[EDWARD]
Ignore him, dear.

27:40.005 --> 27:44.266
Ah, Mr. Barstow. And if
it isn't the future reverend.

27:44.504 --> 27:48.137
I understand that we'll be
hearing your sermons one day.

27:48.138 --> 27:50.126
Do you have a
favorite scripture?

27:51.005 --> 27:52.664
Uh--

27:55.004 --> 27:57.402
Go on, don't be shy.

28:02.137 --> 28:04.270
[WILLIAM] Charlie reads
his Bible every day.

28:04.271 --> 28:05.634
[EMILY]
Charlie!

28:10.438 --> 28:13.403
Poor boy would do
anything for that candle.

28:14.637 --> 28:15.903
[WILLIAM] Hasn't
been able to say a

28:15.904 --> 28:17.893
word since his parents died.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.636
[chaotic chatter]

28:39.636 --> 28:41.069
[WOMAN]
Mrs. Haddington!

28:41.070 --> 28:42.831
[MAN]
Take my request!

28:46.736 --> 28:49.002
[MAN]
Has he been yet, sir?

28:49.003 --> 28:51.268
What are we going to do?

28:51.269 --> 28:53.569
Wish the candle came
with a name attached.

28:53.569 --> 28:55.235
What if we already know?

28:55.235 --> 28:56.602
What?

28:56.602 --> 29:00.466
The candle.What if we
already know who should get it?

29:00.669 --> 29:02.430
But we can't!

29:02.736 --> 29:04.602
It's going to take
a miracle, Bea.

29:04.602 --> 29:06.968
I mean,Thomas has
been gone for ten years!

29:06.968 --> 29:09.763
He's not going to
come home on his own.

29:10.735 --> 29:14.001
Keeping the Christmas Candle
for ourselves is so selfish!

29:14.002 --> 29:15.468
Is it?

29:15.468 --> 29:17.468
I mean, think of the people.
For two hundred years,

29:17.468 --> 29:21.094
our family has been
alight to Gladbury.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.267
Does the flame go out with us?

29:25.935 --> 29:28.765
Keep the Christmas Candle?

29:29.301 --> 29:32.392
For the good of Gladbury.

<i>â™ª</i>

30:19.733 --> 30:21.165
Edward!

30:23.766 --> 30:27.755
[dramatic ethereal music]

31:17.498 --> 31:19.487
[blast]

31:23.564 --> 31:25.630
Well don't look at me!
Get the candle!

31:25.631 --> 31:28.597
[EDWARD]
Oh yes, yes of course!

31:29.297 --> 31:30.957
[Edward trips]
[Bea cries out]

31:33.631 --> 31:35.130
[BEA]
Why, Edward!

31:35.130 --> 31:36.797
[EDWARD]
I couldn't see!

31:36.798 --> 31:38.787
It must be here somewhere.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.263
It must be.

31:40.264 --> 31:42.730
Must be here.
Where is it?

31:42.963 --> 31:45.725
Where is it?
Oh Edward!

31:45.930 --> 31:47.919
Where is it?

31:48.064 --> 31:49.893
Oh!

31:52.297 --> 31:55.922
I've lost the Christmas Candle.

31:56.963 --> 31:59.495
Oh surely this is
God punishing us.

31:59.496 --> 32:01.163
[BEA] Oh don't talk
like that, Edward.

32:01.164 --> 32:06.460
I was--I was foolish to
think that candle was ours.

32:24.896 --> 32:26.657
Is it all clear?

32:28.229 --> 32:30.058
[BEA]
Seems to be.

32:32.996 --> 32:35.427
[BEA] Edward!
The reverend is here!

32:35.629 --> 32:37.492
Hide the candles!

32:39.395 --> 32:41.328
[DAVID] Mr. Haddington.
Mrs. Haddington.

32:41.328 --> 32:43.123
[BEA] What a
pleasant surprise.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.625
[DAVID] I imagine your
night was eventful.

32:47.462 --> 32:49.485
So is it here?

32:52.761 --> 32:54.727
The Christmas Candle?

32:54.728 --> 32:56.161
Yes, yes it's here somewhere.

32:56.162 --> 32:57.162
Bea, Bea.

32:57.162 --> 32:58.594
Of course you're not
going to show it to me,

32:58.594 --> 33:00.458
but that's not why I came.

33:01.594 --> 33:04.393
The people's requests
for the candle...

33:04.394 --> 33:06.417
...may I see them?

33:13.795 --> 33:15.895
[BEA] What do you suppose he
intends to do with them'!

33:15.895 --> 33:19.088
[EDWARD]
I don't know. Pray'!

33:19.327 --> 33:21.589
That's what we should be doing.

33:21.761 --> 33:24.093
We've got to
make it better, Bea.

33:24.094 --> 33:25.992
Yes, but how?

33:27.428 --> 33:30.053
[DAVID]
All done. Thank you.

33:30.794 --> 33:33.660
You may have one candle
to give, but I hope to

33:33.660 --> 33:36.649
give everyone a little
light this Christmas.

33:36.794 --> 33:37.760
That's it!

33:37.760 --> 33:38.626
What?

33:38.627 --> 33:41.787
I mean... that's a lovely idea.

33:41.994 --> 33:43.727
Well, you mustn't delay.

33:43.727 --> 33:46.426
So much to be done
before Christmas.

33:46.427 --> 33:47.393
Good day to you.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.393
[BEA] Yes, yes, God speed
to you on your quest.

33:49.393 --> 33:51.154
What's got into you?

33:56.393 --> 33:59.086
We give them away. All of them.

33:59.293 --> 34:01.459
And have the
entire village think

34:01.460 --> 34:03.892
they've got the actual
Christmas Candle?

34:03.893 --> 34:05.126
We won't tell them that.

34:05.126 --> 34:06.625
We'll tell them what
this family has told

34:06.626 --> 34:09.456
them for generations:
to light it and pray.

34:09.626 --> 34:12.993
But this is Gladbury.
People talk.

34:12.993 --> 34:16.592
Edward, somebody':
miracle is in this basket.

34:16.592 --> 34:19.489
And we won't let it go to waste!

34:22.492 --> 34:24.123
[WILLIAM] Charlie,
the reverend has offered

34:24.125 --> 34:26.284
to give you Bible lessons.

34:27.159 --> 34:31.125
[William coughs]

34:31.125 --> 34:32.818
[DAVID]
Hello, Charlie.

34:33.159 --> 34:37.818
Why don't we start with the
Gospel of John chapter one.

34:42.391 --> 34:47.091
"In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,

34:47.092 --> 34:49.757
and the Word was God.

34:49.757 --> 34:52.491
The same was in
the beginning with God.

34:52.491 --> 34:54.623
All things were made by him;

34:54.625 --> 34:59.091
and without him was not any
thing made that was made.

34:59.091 --> 35:03.723
In him was life; and the
life was the light of men.

35:03.724 --> 35:06.124
And the light
shineth in darkness;

35:06.124 --> 35:09.920
and the darkness
comprehend it not."

35:15.924 --> 35:19.723
"And the impediment
to his tongue was loosed,

35:19.724 --> 35:22.451
and he spoke plainly."

35:24.323 --> 35:28.914
Now Charlie, we are going
to loose that tongue of yours.

35:29.791 --> 35:31.450
Open wide.

35:33.657 --> 35:34.986
<i>And...</i>

35:39.623 --> 35:41.146
[DAVID]
Very good.

35:41.457 --> 35:43.116
<i>And...</i>

35:47.322 --> 35:48.288
Louder.

35:48.756 --> 35:52.586
[nonsensical sounds]

36:03.889 --> 36:05.752
Louder.

36:22.922 --> 36:24.547
[knock at window]

36:29.755 --> 36:32.421
Light this and pray, Charlie.

36:32.422 --> 36:35.115
Even if it's only in your heart.

36:35.321 --> 36:37.150
God will hear you.

36:58.387 --> 37:00.253
[DAVID]
Good morning, Mr. Finch.

37:00.254 --> 37:02.087
What brings you to our home?

37:02.087 --> 37:05.087
[DAVID] I understand you
have requested the candle.

37:05.087 --> 37:07.985
I wondered if
I might be of service.

37:10.654 --> 37:12.986
Reverend, meet my family.

37:12.987 --> 37:14.554
My wife, Delilah.

37:14.554 --> 37:15.453
Hello.

37:15.454 --> 37:16.454
[PHINEAS]
Children.

37:16.454 --> 37:18.120
This is my father, Oliver.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.211
[OLIVER]
The new reverend!

37:20.720 --> 37:22.549
[PHINEAS]
Over here, Dad.

37:22.987 --> 37:24.384
Come on.

37:24.586 --> 37:26.285
Don't suppose you
could help the old man

37:26.286 --> 37:28.386
get his hands on the
Christmas Candle?

37:28.386 --> 37:30.252
Maybe put in a word
to the Haddingtons.

37:30.253 --> 37:31.453
[OLIVER]
Hogwash.

37:31.453 --> 37:33.986
The next time I see,
I hope to be

37:33.987 --> 37:36.252
looking at the Good
Lord himself.

37:36.253 --> 37:42.152
In the meantime, I'll walk
by faith, right Reverend?

37:42.620 --> 37:44.142
Right.

37:47.153 --> 37:49.453
Oh thank you.Thank you so much!

37:49.453 --> 37:52.044
It'll be a happy
Christmas after all!

37:52.952 --> 37:57.384
Remember, children,
this is our little secret.

38:19.419 --> 38:23.085
Reverend Richmond! Do come in.

38:23.085 --> 38:26.318
I've been praying for
company, Reverend.

38:26.318 --> 38:29.283
[DAVID] Why waste a prayer
when I can meet the need?

38:29.284 --> 38:33.910
So you'll find me a
knitting companion?

38:35.584 --> 38:39.539
<i>I... shall.</i>

38:45.117 --> 38:46.708
[KIDS]
Coming!

38:47.884 --> 38:50.484
Don't waste a candle
on an old man like me.

38:50.484 --> 38:54.575
Oliver, there's no such
thing as a wasted prayer.

38:57.650 --> 39:00.416
[MRS. BICKERTON] My stove
doesn't work, and my husband

39:00.417 --> 39:04.247
ran off and left me all on my
own with a colicky baby.

39:04.717 --> 39:08.316
Oh, and then yesterday
the wall fell down,

39:08.316 --> 39:10.716
and my goat left me, too.

39:10.717 --> 39:14.479
I shall keep an eye out...
for both of them.

39:18.717 --> 39:21.944
The Reverend fixing our roof.

39:22.216 --> 39:25.049
We so desperately need it.

39:25.050 --> 39:30.783
Speaking of which, Agnes, my
dumpling, hadn't you a request?

39:30.783 --> 39:33.874
[DAVID] Ah, yes,
Miss Agnes Chumley.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.708
But I see it is
an unspoken request.

39:37.382 --> 39:38.882
Well, go on.

39:38.883 --> 39:41.644
A silent request
is no request at all.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.749
I'm praying for a husband.

39:44.749 --> 39:46.873
By Easter.

40:03.249 --> 40:04.648
Mrs. Haddington.

40:04.648 --> 40:05.748
What brings you here?

40:05.748 --> 40:06.914
[BEA] I've come to
let you know that

40:06.915 --> 40:08.781
your request has been heard.

40:08.782 --> 40:11.805
Oh what a dear,
but I couldn't accept.

40:11.982 --> 40:15.573
That handsome young
reverend has been helping me.

40:18.748 --> 40:20.407
[BEA]
I see.

40:31.214 --> 40:37.305
[BEA] Agnes, dear,
light this and pray.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.071
Mother!

40:44.081 --> 40:46.376
It's the devil's work!

40:48.614 --> 40:50.213
[WIDOW LEONARD]
You tell her, Reverend.

40:50.213 --> 40:51.613
It's unnatural.

40:51.614 --> 40:52.879
What'!

40:52.880 --> 40:54.710
Ungodly.

40:55.647 --> 40:57.135
Yes.

40:59.414 --> 41:01.080
[DAVID] And the light
shineth in Gladbury,

41:01.080 --> 41:02.913
and yet the people
comprehend it not.

41:02.913 --> 41:03.746
[Emily laughs]

41:03.746 --> 41:06.579
[EMILY] Make fun all you want,
you've decided to stay here.

41:06.579 --> 41:08.807
Just long enough
to do some good.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.472
I have a letter
to post for London.

41:12.646 --> 41:16.779
Ruth Goodchild.
To a lady no less.

41:16.780 --> 41:17.946
[DAVID]
Yes, she's a guest of the

41:17.946 --> 41:20.478
Salvation Army in a
difficult situation.

41:20.479 --> 41:22.468
She's just a girl really.

41:23.879 --> 41:26.811
Stockings. Sweets.

41:29.879 --> 41:31.446
May I help you?

41:31.446 --> 41:36.639
I'm looking for, well, uh,
a lot of things actually.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.378
[EMILY]
Sardines.

41:39.545 --> 41:40.878
Thank you.

41:40.879 --> 41:42.435
Soap.

41:44.578 --> 41:45.611
String.

41:45.612 --> 41:47.079
It's alphabetical.

41:47.079 --> 41:48.244
I see.

41:48.245 --> 41:50.445
[DAVID] Well, to do much,
one must be organized.

41:50.445 --> 41:53.611
You really do want to
help these people, don't you'!

41:53.612 --> 41:55.407
Of course I do.

41:56.478 --> 42:00.739
[church organ]

42:02.378 --> 42:03.877
[DAVID]
Welcome everyone.

42:03.878 --> 42:08.144
We light the second candle
of Advent in the love of God.

42:08.145 --> 42:10.477
During Advent,
God pierces the darkness

42:10.477 --> 42:13.637
of the world with
divine light and love.

42:15.477 --> 42:20.637
Because he loved us, he sent
his son to light the way.

42:21.778 --> 42:24.539
Though we must wait
for Christmas day,

42:25.711 --> 42:29.644
we must not wait to love
one another as Christ did.

42:29.644 --> 42:32.973
Does your neighbor need
a miracle this Christmas?

42:34.244 --> 42:36.876
Well why not be that miracle?

42:36.877 --> 42:38.309
[mumbling in crowd]

42:40.576 --> 42:41.974
[MR. COLLINS]
Reverend!

42:42.710 --> 42:43.810
Hello Mr. Collins.

42:43.810 --> 42:45.409
Thought maybe
you could use a hand.

42:45.410 --> 42:48.138
You know, "be the miracle."

42:49.144 --> 42:54.132
<i>â™ª</i>

42:56.376 --> 42:57.706
[DAVID] Ow.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.974
Where did he come from?

43:06.942 --> 43:08.374
[EDWARD]
Reverend.

43:08.543 --> 43:11.309
[BEA]
Happy candle. Christmas!

43:11.309 --> 43:12.641
[DAVID]
And to you.

43:12.642 --> 43:14.075
[EDWARD]Why'd you
have to say that. Come on.

43:14.076 --> 43:15.905
[BEA]
I'm so sorry.

43:23.242 --> 43:25.401
[DAVID]The prodigal
goat has returned.

43:26.442 --> 43:28.067
Thank you.

43:28.742 --> 43:30.475
Oh, you won't believe it!

43:30.475 --> 43:33.407
The neighbors are
building me a new wall.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.704
[metal clanging]

43:54.474 --> 43:55.607
Here he comes.

43:55.608 --> 43:57.301
Shh.

44:08.408 --> 44:10.601
[metal clanging]

44:18.907 --> 44:20.107
[DAVID]
How does it feel?

44:20.107 --> 44:24.272
Feels... it feels
a lot like seeing!

44:24.273 --> 44:27.967
See Reverend, you
are a miracle worker.

44:30.140 --> 44:31.766
[DAVID]
Hello.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.707
That's a lot of food, Reverend.

44:35.707 --> 44:38.036
Well, you have a
lot of mouths to feed.

44:40.206 --> 44:42.069
That's beautiful.

44:43.073 --> 44:45.096
Another visitor, I--

44:45.607 --> 44:46.706
Hello everyone.

44:46.706 --> 44:50.264
[DAVID] Um,Widow Leonard
just brought us a feast!

44:50.539 --> 44:53.072
Please,join us Reverend.

44:53.073 --> 44:54.561
[DAVID]
Why not?

44:59.472 --> 45:01.271
[WIDOW LEONARD]
I know we fast during Advent

45:01.272 --> 45:03.605
and save the feasting
for Christmas day,

45:03.606 --> 45:08.766
but having company,
that's like Christmas to me.

45:09.439 --> 45:11.802
Gladbury': Christmas pudding.

45:14.872 --> 45:16.532
[BEA]
Light this and pray.

45:23.139 --> 45:26.128
[EDWARD]
Light this and pray.

45:55.971 --> 46:32.869
[prayers spoken aloud,
fading in and out]

46:32.870 --> 46:33.460
[VOICE]
Amen.

46:33.636 --> 46:34.193
[VOICE]
Amen.

46:34.770 --> 46:36.031
[GROUP]
Amen.

46:36.903 --> 46:39.302
[DAVID] Rejoice,
for today we light

46:39.302 --> 46:41.402
the third candle of Advent,

46:41.403 --> 46:43.392
the candle of joy.

46:47.136 --> 46:52.302
When Christ was born,
God used angels to proclaim

46:52.302 --> 46:54.634
"good tidings of great joy."

46:54.635 --> 46:57.068
To all mankind.

46:57.069 --> 47:00.728
Now, we are the messengers
of this good news.

47:01.869 --> 47:05.401
For with every good deed,
every act of kindness,

47:05.402 --> 47:09.096
Christ is born again
and again in our lives.

47:09.535 --> 47:13.768
Now let us go forth,
as joyful messengers,

47:13.769 --> 47:15.961
doing the work of God.

47:21.135 --> 47:23.901
Your work in this town is
impressive, Reverend Richmond.

47:23.901 --> 47:24.967
Thank you, Lady Camdon.

47:24.968 --> 47:27.634
Still there are limits
to what man can do.

47:27.634 --> 47:29.401
[MRS. CHUMLEY]
Reverend. Reverend.

47:29.402 --> 47:30.390
Mrs. Chumley.

47:31.035 --> 47:32.466
Miss Chumley.

47:32.968 --> 47:36.593
How lovely to see
a sister in the Lord.

47:36.734 --> 47:38.967
Well go on my dear,
what have you to say?

47:38.968 --> 47:41.467
I've already made my wishes
known to the Reverend.

47:41.467 --> 47:44.025
And now I'm taking
a step of faith.

47:45.234 --> 47:46.928
Thank you.

47:52.567 --> 47:54.866
[DAVID] Another prayer that
will never be answered.

47:54.867 --> 47:56.766
Well, I for one am
happy to see that

47:56.767 --> 47:58.434
In spite of all your efforts,

47:58.434 --> 48:02.593
you are still inspiring
hope for a miracle.

48:13.233 --> 48:15.199
Come in.

48:16.800 --> 48:18.299
[DAVID]
Mrs. Hopewell.

48:18.299 --> 48:20.532
A friend of mine may be
coming to Gladbury for a while.

48:20.533 --> 48:22.299
I wondered if she might
stay with you and Herbert.

48:22.299 --> 48:23.732
[ELEANOR] She can stay
as long as she likes.

48:23.733 --> 48:25.265
[DAVID] Thank you!
Her name's Ruth.

48:25.266 --> 48:27.698
My colleague Abner
will bring her from London.

48:28.466 --> 48:30.193
Oh, please, allow me.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.932
[ELEANOR]
This is no job for a reverend.

48:31.932 --> 48:32.898
[DAVID]
Nonsense.

48:32.899 --> 48:34.865
[ELEANOR]
This is no job for a lady.

48:35.565 --> 48:38.929
Mrs. Hopewell.
Whatever is the matter?

48:39.365 --> 48:41.099
No, I won't do it.

48:41.099 --> 48:44.431
[DOCTOR] Herbert, you're one
good shock away from the grave.

48:44.432 --> 48:46.065
I'll get plenty of
rest in Heaven.

48:46.066 --> 48:47.032
Herbert.

48:47.033 --> 48:48.766
[DOCTOR] Which
may not be that far off.

48:48.766 --> 48:50.532
You've got a weak heart.

48:50.532 --> 48:52.465
I have a strong faith.

48:52.465 --> 48:55.298
God will either cure me,
or He'll call me home.

48:55.298 --> 48:57.564
[ELEANOR] Of course
he will, but you have to rest.

48:57.565 --> 48:59.197
[DOCTOR] No more
carrying heavy boxes,

48:59.198 --> 49:00.964
climbing ladders,
or chopping wood.

49:00.965 --> 49:01.965
Do you hear me?

49:01.965 --> 49:04.090
But that's my job!

49:04.232 --> 49:05.798
I will chop the wood.

49:05.798 --> 49:08.798
No. No m'lady, I won't have it.

49:08.798 --> 49:11.064
Please. Pray for him, Reverend.

49:11.065 --> 49:12.758
[DAVID]
Certainly.

49:13.698 --> 49:17.131
Our Father in Heaven, please
grant your servant Herbert with

49:17.132 --> 49:18.598
the good sense to follow the

49:18.598 --> 49:22.121
doctor's orders and
get some rest.

49:26.798 --> 49:28.063
[DAVID] I've had
enough of Herbert

49:28.064 --> 49:29.397
hauling crates of candles.

49:29.398 --> 49:32.464
Besides, it's high time
that Gladbury see the light.

49:32.464 --> 49:36.263
[EMILY] Electricity...
In the church.

49:36.264 --> 49:38.630
For too long the church has
stumbled about in the dark ages,

49:38.630 --> 49:40.863
when it should
be lighting the way.

49:40.864 --> 49:42.364
In fact, I believe that
the church should

49:42.364 --> 49:45.386
be the first place to
embrace the future.

49:45.764 --> 49:48.930
Indeed. Now this I have to see.

49:48.930 --> 49:51.030
[DAVID] Miss Barstow,
does this mean that you'll

49:51.031 --> 49:53.031
finally be coming to church?

49:53.031 --> 49:55.196
[Emily laughs]

49:55.196 --> 49:57.355
Twenty-nine prayers.

49:57.530 --> 49:59.263
And only one can be answered.

49:59.263 --> 50:04.263
You mean thirty, dear.
Thirty candles.

50:04.263 --> 50:05.895
No, I'm certain
there were twenty-nine.

50:05.896 --> 50:07.862
[EDWARD] Bea, there were
thirty candles hanging

50:07.863 --> 50:09.596
the night of the angel's visit.

50:09.596 --> 50:11.960
There're always thirty candles.

50:14.063 --> 50:15.529
Twenty-nine!

50:15.529 --> 50:17.428
Bea, a candle is--

50:17.429 --> 50:20.929
Don't say it Edward,
please don't say it out loud.

50:20.929 --> 50:24.089
We've lost the candle.

50:25.095 --> 50:28.892
[hammering and voices]

50:34.795 --> 50:37.861
I'm curious to know the maximum
number you've ever installed.

50:37.862 --> 50:39.260
[ELECTRICIAN]
About twenty.

50:39.596 --> 50:41.289
[DAVID]
Then I want thirty.

50:41.762 --> 50:43.955
No, thirty-five bulbs.

50:44.595 --> 50:46.362
I question the safety of it.

50:46.362 --> 50:48.594
The circuit can only support
so many watts, Reverend.

50:48.595 --> 50:51.461
[DAVID] Then install another
circuit. Install five circuits.

50:51.461 --> 50:53.294
I want the light in
this church to surpass

50:53.294 --> 50:56.460
the brightness of one
thousand candles.

50:56.461 --> 50:58.794
[HERBERT] Reverend Richmond,
could you tell me why

50:58.795 --> 51:01.960
there are men digging
in the church yard,

51:01.961 --> 51:04.553
and fiddling in
our sanctuary walls.

51:05.795 --> 51:08.294
You leave that. My grandfather
carved that altar.

51:08.294 --> 51:13.783
[DAVID] Herbert! I ordered them
here to install electricity.

51:14.927 --> 51:16.093
Electricity?

51:16.094 --> 51:18.227
Electricity is the future.

51:18.228 --> 51:19.627
And a more
practical one at that.

51:19.627 --> 51:20.727
Practical you say'!

51:20.727 --> 51:24.227
How will our treasury
stand this extravagance?

51:24.228 --> 51:26.760
Don't trouble yourself,
Mr. Hopewell.

51:26.761 --> 51:29.057
I've covered the
cost personally.

51:29.293 --> 51:30.960
Consider it my contribution to a

51:30.961 --> 51:33.694
brighter chapter of
Gladbury': history.

51:33.694 --> 51:36.959
I plan to unveil the electricity
at the coming nativity service.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.449
Herbert, your heart.

51:39.193 --> 51:40.393
Sit down, love.

51:40.394 --> 51:41.726
Aye.

51:41.726 --> 51:44.259
[DAVID] Please, think of
this with an open mind.

51:44.260 --> 51:48.859
Think of Herbert. No cumbersome
candles or lanterns to change.

51:48.860 --> 51:50.559
You of all people should
see the value in that.

51:50.559 --> 51:52.458
[ELEANOR]
You could use a lighter load.

51:52.459 --> 51:57.059
L...What'll I do with all
the Haddington candles?

51:57.060 --> 52:00.459
Well, <i>I...</i> I imagine that
we can return them.

52:00.459 --> 52:03.516
In fact, that's the
task that I'll gladly take on.

52:04.192 --> 52:06.750
[BEA] Oh, it's got to
be here somewhere.

52:08.793 --> 52:10.224
Edward!

52:12.359 --> 52:14.188
I have a feeling Edward.

52:15.459 --> 52:17.890
I have a feeling
this is the one.

52:18.259 --> 52:20.622
The Christmas Candle.

52:21.459 --> 52:24.050
What are you suggesting?

52:24.425 --> 52:26.092
I'm not suggesting anything.

52:26.092 --> 52:28.524
I'm... asking.

52:28.525 --> 52:30.591
[knock at the door]

52:30.592 --> 52:31.785
Mr. Haddington.

52:31.959 --> 52:33.224
Reverend.

52:33.225 --> 52:35.059
I regret to inform
you that St. Mark's

52:35.059 --> 52:37.251
no longer requires your candles.

52:37.458 --> 52:39.224
But that's a standing order.

52:39.225 --> 52:41.282
It has been for
two hundred years.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.291
It's standing no more,
I'm afraid.

52:43.291 --> 52:45.457
But I just delivered
three crates.

52:45.458 --> 52:48.257
Yes,thank you,
but we only need one.

52:48.258 --> 52:50.621
<i>But... but--</i>

52:50.758 --> 52:53.849
[DAVID] Trust me when I say,
it's for the good of Gladbury.

52:54.025 --> 52:56.457
[BEA] What does he know
about the good of Gladbury?

52:56.457 --> 52:59.219
This is our legacy,
and he's meddling with it.

52:59.524 --> 53:02.581
I say we light the candle
right now. We've earned it.

53:03.290 --> 53:05.950
We're going to
give this candle away.

53:08.224 --> 53:09.747
To whom'!

53:16.190 --> 53:17.917
[BEA]
Of course.

53:18.357 --> 53:23.380
<i>â™ª</i>

53:27.556 --> 53:29.920
God bless you, sir.
God bless you, ma'am.

53:44.423 --> 53:45.753
[WORKER]
These are ready to go.

53:47.390 --> 53:48.623
[WORKER]
Give us a hand.

53:48.623 --> 53:51.214
â™ª
[typing]

53:57.390 --> 53:59.956
[BEA] Whatever will
they think of next?

53:59.956 --> 54:01.888
[SECRETARY]
May I help you?

54:04.189 --> 54:06.454
Um, we're here to
see Thomas Haddington.

54:06.455 --> 54:08.012
And you are?

54:09.023 --> 54:11.682
We're his parents.

54:12.188 --> 54:13.421
We have a gift for our son.

54:13.422 --> 54:14.789
[SECRETARY]
Mr. Haddington': away.

54:14.789 --> 54:17.277
But I'd be happy to
receive it on his behalf.

54:17.422 --> 54:19.684
[EDWARD] Perhaps we
could leave it for him.

54:30.188 --> 54:33.415
[EDWARD]You watch,
Bea, he'll come home.

54:39.055 --> 54:45.621
â™ª ...of redeeming grace. â™ª

54:45.621 --> 54:53.611
â™ª Jesus, Lord at thy birth. â™ª

54:54.787 --> 55:04.778
â™ª Jesus, Lord at thy birth. â™ª

55:08.920 --> 55:13.409
In my short time in Gladbury,
I have seen many miracles.

55:13.887 --> 55:16.053
I have seen angels at work.

55:16.054 --> 55:20.520
I have seen them on the
rooftops, at kitchen tables,

55:20.520 --> 55:23.213
and in this very sanctuary.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.952
In fact, I see these angels now.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.418
Mr. Hardy Collins.

55:30.886 --> 55:32.579
Dear Ms. Leonard.

55:34.519 --> 55:38.186
Herbert Hopewell. And every
single one of you who has

55:38.186 --> 55:40.451
allowed the light of
Christ to shine through

55:40.452 --> 55:42.885
your good works this
Advent season.

55:42.886 --> 55:45.752
From what I've read
of Gladbury': past,

55:45.753 --> 55:47.786
this town has
glowed with a certain

55:47.786 --> 55:50.619
miraculous light
for generations.

55:50.619 --> 55:57.040
But today marks the dawning
of a new age in Gladbury.

56:16.019 --> 56:18.618
[DAVID] It is my hope that
in centuries to come,

56:18.618 --> 56:23.949
our beloved church will
shine even brighter still.

56:34.851 --> 56:36.408
Ghastly.

56:38.084 --> 56:40.616
[WIDOW LEONARD]
It's witchcraft! Witchcraft

56:40.617 --> 56:43.378
in the house of the Lord.

56:43.684 --> 56:46.950
[electrical shorts heard]

56:46.951 --> 56:48.746
[CHILD]
Mummy! Daddy!

56:54.018 --> 56:55.183
Get the children!

56:55.183 --> 56:56.774
[DAVID]
Everyone, please!

56:58.350 --> 56:59.850
Remain calm!

56:59.851 --> 57:02.408
[MRS. BICKERTON]
Oh, my poor sweet baby Jesus.

57:04.350 --> 57:11.016
F-F-F-F

57:11.017 --> 57:12.915
Fire!

57:14.783 --> 57:16.382
Dorothy... Dorothy,
get the boy out.

57:16.383 --> 57:17.283
[DAVID]
Remain calm!

57:17.283 --> 57:18.942
[OLIVER] My hat!

57:32.383 --> 57:35.780
Please, everyone, remain calm!

57:38.082 --> 57:40.843
[HERBERT] No,
my grandfather's altar!

57:48.382 --> 57:49.439
[DAVID]
Herbert!

57:52.615 --> 57:54.104
[DAVID]
Herbert!

57:58.415 --> 58:00.745
[DAVID] ls he going
to be alright?

58:04.281 --> 58:06.076
[DOCTOR]
He's dead.

58:07.582 --> 58:12.571
<i>â™ª</i>

58:59.279 --> 59:00.711
[EMILY]
Reverend!

59:05.913 --> 59:06.746
Miss Barstow.

59:06.747 --> 59:09.235
It's my father.
He's called for you.

59:21.046 --> 59:22.773
[EMILY]
You're alright, Father.

59:25.712 --> 59:27.871
Reverend Richmond's arrived.

59:29.679 --> 59:31.736
Pray for me, Reverend.

59:33.545 --> 59:35.875
What ails you, Mr. Barstow?

59:36.445 --> 59:39.434
Dr. Clem': diagnosed
Father with consumption.

59:43.245 --> 59:45.777
[EMILY] Said he's
done all he can do.

59:45.778 --> 59:48.074
[WILLIAM]
God'll do the rest.

59:48.412 --> 59:50.378
Right, Reverend?

59:56.112 --> 01:00:00.601
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:00:06.344 --> 01:00:08.606
[EMILY] Do you have anything
to say for yourself'!

01:00:08.945 --> 01:00:11.910
I'm sorry, but I can't give your
father what he's asking for.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:12.844
All he wants is--

01:00:12.845 --> 01:00:14.511
I know what he wants.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:15.910
[EMILY]
Then give it to him.

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.210
You're a minister;
he's a dying man.

01:00:18.211 --> 01:00:19.944
You can't give him
a simple prayer?

01:00:19.944 --> 01:00:22.342
Look, if it's so simple,
then why don't you do it?

01:00:26.344 --> 01:00:28.866
I don't believe in miracles.

01:01:27.708 --> 01:01:32.708
The fourth candle of Advent,
our last before Christmas Eve,

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:37.936
represents the peace of God,
who passes all understanding.

01:01:38.274 --> 01:01:41.173
In the coming days of Christmas,

01:01:41.174 --> 01:01:44.207
let us be instruments
of this peace,

01:01:44.208 --> 01:01:46.875
Shining light where
there is darkness,

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:50.040
hope where there is despair,

01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:54.030
sowing joy where
there is sadness...

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:01.239
...and faith where
there is doubt.

01:02:17.173 --> 01:02:19.573
You asked me
to fill your pulpit,

01:02:19.574 --> 01:02:22.040
and instead
I emptied your church.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.666
You mustn't take all the credit.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:27.235
I did ask you to come.

01:02:28.574 --> 01:02:31.563
I am a man of faith,
Lady Camdon.

01:02:32.007 --> 01:02:34.939
I believe God worked
in the appointed time.

01:02:35.673 --> 01:02:39.873
But in our modern age,
the lame don't walk,

01:02:39.873 --> 01:02:44.205
blind men do not see,
and the sick die.

01:02:44.206 --> 01:02:46.729
But sometimes they live.

01:02:48.606 --> 01:02:50.765
Walk with me, Reverend.

01:02:54.072 --> 01:02:55.871
[LADY CAMDON]
Twenty-five years ago,

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:59.272
our town suffered
great hardship.

01:02:59.272 --> 01:03:00.605
That's when the Haddingtons gave

01:03:00.606 --> 01:03:02.938
The candle to
Reverend Pillington.

01:03:02.939 --> 01:03:05.598
But when he lit
the candle to pray...

01:03:06.538 --> 01:03:09.663
...well, he nearly burned
the vestry to the ground.

01:03:10.072 --> 01:03:12.671
The poor dear was in despair,

01:03:12.672 --> 01:03:16.005
and then, within
the church walls,

01:03:16.006 --> 01:03:18.171
a treasure was discovered,

01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:21.399
several gold crosses
and a ruby brooch.

01:03:22.105 --> 01:03:23.696
A hidden treasure?

01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:26.571
Well, had it not
been for the fire,

01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:28.505
it would've remained hidden.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:31.238
And thankfully, there was just
enough to repair the church

01:03:31.238 --> 01:03:33.004
And to provide for Gladbury's

01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:35.596
impoverished
families that winter.

01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:39.570
The very first
Christmas Candle

01:03:39.571 --> 01:03:42.765
went to my
great-great-great-grandmother.

01:03:44.171 --> 01:03:49.069
Once she was a
hopeless orphan, and then...

01:03:55.537 --> 01:03:58.770
Miracles are part of
our inheritance, Reverend.

01:03:58.771 --> 01:04:00.827
Tell that to Mrs. Hopewell.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.403
I believe you'll find
Mrs. Hopewell': faith to be much

01:04:04.404 --> 01:04:07.665
stronger than the grief
she's feeling now.

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:12.770
Your doubts don't
trouble me, Reverend.

01:04:12.770 --> 01:04:17.702
On the contrary,
they inspire my faith.

01:04:46.003 --> 01:04:47.935
[honk]

01:05:06.901 --> 01:05:08.901
[BEA] Edward,
have a look at this!

01:05:08.901 --> 01:05:12.901
It's a carriage
that pulls itself!

01:05:12.901 --> 01:05:14.890
In all my days...

01:05:20.401 --> 01:05:23.492
Bea! It's Thomas!

01:05:24.002 --> 01:05:25.234
It's Thomas.

01:05:25.234 --> 01:05:27.200
[THOMAS]
Father. Mother.

01:05:31.067 --> 01:05:35.830
Oh, look at you,
handsome and fancy!

01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:37.767
That carriage of yours!

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:41.100
It's called a Stanley Steamer,
one of the first of its kind.

01:05:41.101 --> 01:05:43.363
I had it shipped from America.

01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:44.933
[EDWARD] Shall I help you
bring in your luggage?

01:05:44.934 --> 01:05:46.267
[THOMAS] Oh,
I'm not staying, Father.

01:05:46.267 --> 01:05:48.858
Oh, not staying, don't be silly.

01:05:49.267 --> 01:05:50.666
I'm married, Mother.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:52.758
I'm on the way to
meet her family now.

01:05:54.533 --> 01:05:56.431
Getting married.

01:05:56.834 --> 01:06:00.200
Name's Priscilla.
She's the daughter of a baron.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.996
Oh! And, are you happy?

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.888
I'm finally making a name
for myself, for the family.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.999
Business is expanding,

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.057
and one day I'll
introduce you to Priscilla.

01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:21.196
Why did you come?

01:06:31.399 --> 01:06:35.699
I know how much this candle
means to you, to Gladbury,

01:06:35.699 --> 01:06:38.028
but it's lost on me.

01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:43.831
You must light it and pray,
and then you'll see.

01:06:43.832 --> 01:06:45.098
See what, Mother?

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:46.599
A miracle?

01:06:46.599 --> 01:06:48.432
Gladbury needs you, son.

01:06:48.432 --> 01:06:50.198
The world needs me.

01:06:50.199 --> 01:06:54.188
I'm lighting up entire cities.

01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:03.032
It was good to see you.

01:07:03.032 --> 01:07:04.691
Both of you.

01:07:06.198 --> 01:07:08.255
[THOMAS]
Merry Christmas.

01:07:08.698 --> 01:07:12.027
Thomas, the miracles, the angel,
you saw it with your own eyes.

01:07:12.365 --> 01:07:16.922
I was a child. I saw
what I wanted to see.

01:07:17.398 --> 01:07:18.997
Goodbye.

01:07:18.998 --> 01:07:20.759
[BEA]
Thomas.

01:08:17.162 --> 01:08:18.685
Reverend.

01:08:19.196 --> 01:08:21.594
I would like to see your father.

01:08:35.162 --> 01:08:37.821
[William coughing]

01:08:39.362 --> 01:08:42.725
[EMILY]
Father. Father.

01:08:53.728 --> 01:08:57.421
[DAVID]
Mr. Barstow, if I may.

01:09:06.394 --> 01:09:08.861
[DAVID] And it came to
pass that a certain

01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:12.027
blind man sat by the
wayside begging,

01:09:12.028 --> 01:09:17.187
He cried, "Jesus, thou Son of
David, have mercy on me."

01:09:17.394 --> 01:09:19.327
And Jesus said unto him,

01:09:19.327 --> 01:09:22.260
"What wilt though that
I should do unto thee?"

01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:24.593
The blind man said unto him,

01:09:24.594 --> 01:09:27.826
"Lord, that I might
receive my sight."

01:09:27.827 --> 01:09:33.993
And Jesus said, "Go thy way;
thy faith has made thee whole."

01:09:33.993 --> 01:09:36.693
And immediately
he received his sight

01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:39.591
and followed Jesus in the way.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.593
Did I not say to you
that if you would believe,

01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:44.426
You would see the glory of God.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:45.591
And they took away
the stone from the

01:09:45.593 --> 01:09:47.526
place where the
dead man was lying,

01:09:47.526 --> 01:09:50.024
and Jesus lifted up
his eyes and said,

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:52.158
"Father, I thank you
that you have heard..."

01:09:52.158 --> 01:09:54.192
And these are written
that you might believe

01:09:54.193 --> 01:09:57.092
that Jesus is the
Christ, the son of God,

01:09:57.093 --> 01:09:59.426
and that in believing,
you might have life.

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:01.858
Behold there came a leper
and worshipped him,

01:10:01.859 --> 01:10:05.725
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean."

01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:07.026
And Jesus put forth his hand...

01:10:07.026 --> 01:10:09.159
My little daughter is
at the point of death.

01:10:09.159 --> 01:10:12.025
I pray thee, Lord,
come and lay hands on her,

01:10:12.026 --> 01:10:13.692
that she might be healed.

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:17.556
If I may but touch his
garment, I shall be whole.

01:10:17.759 --> 01:10:20.258
If thou canst believe, all
things are possible to him...

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.157
The father of
the child cried out,

01:10:22.158 --> 01:10:26.857
"Lord, I believe,
help my unbelief!"

01:10:26.858 --> 01:10:31.091
And he said to her,
"Damsel, arise."

01:10:31.092 --> 01:10:34.158
And they were astonished,
a great astonishment.

01:10:34.158 --> 01:10:37.920
Speak the word,
and my servant shall be here.

01:10:38.425 --> 01:10:40.091
<i>â™ª</i>

01:10:40.092 --> 01:10:45.888
And Jesus said unto them,
"Thy faith has made you whole."

01:10:48.858 --> 01:10:52.847
<i>â™ª</i>

01:11:11.191 --> 01:11:14.248
David. David.

01:11:17.991 --> 01:11:20.014
He's asleep.

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:36.523
[DAVID] My wife and daughter
died of consumption.

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:46.483
I prayed. I even
believed for a miracle.

01:11:53.356 --> 01:11:55.515
[DAVID]
But God did nothing.

01:11:58.055 --> 01:11:59.749
Oh, David.

01:12:02.922 --> 01:12:08.150
[DAVID] One day my faith was so
certain, and then it was gone.

01:12:10.356 --> 01:12:13.583
There was a time
when I could not...

01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:19.752
...utter a prayer or step
foot in a church.

01:12:23.855 --> 01:12:27.412
I believe I've made
my peace with God.

01:12:30.088 --> 01:12:33.054
But still I was a
different man before.

01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:40.548
The love I shared,
the hope I had...

01:12:44.421 --> 01:12:47.410
Some things,
they cannot be restored.

01:12:49.188 --> 01:12:51.415
I do hope you're wrong.

01:12:55.487 --> 01:12:58.510
Such a hope is too great a risk.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.077
But I wonder what you
risk living without it.

01:13:18.886 --> 01:13:20.511
[DAVID] [weakly]
I should go.

01:13:33.186 --> 01:13:39.050
[Emily sobs]

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:44.216
Bea.

01:14:44.217 --> 01:14:47.550
He won't light it.
I'll light it for him.

01:14:47.551 --> 01:14:49.141
It's of no use.

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:51.649
Anyway, we don't even
know if it's the right one.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:53.550
Well then we'll find out.

01:14:53.551 --> 01:14:55.850
We did everything we knew to do.

01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:59.475
We gave away every last candle,
and this one came back.

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:02.306
Twice.

01:15:06.650 --> 01:15:10.082
This could be
our miracle, Edward.

01:15:19.316 --> 01:15:21.715
I hope I'm not overstepping
my boundaries,

01:15:21.716 --> 01:15:25.479
but I know just the person to
give the candle to this year.

01:15:26.083 --> 01:15:28.208
David Richmond.

01:15:29.515 --> 01:15:31.708
Think of it, Edward.

01:15:31.849 --> 01:15:35.149
Your father gave the candle
to Reverend Pillington.

01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:38.048
And as we know, David is a far
greater wretch than he ever was.

01:15:38.049 --> 01:15:40.381
[BEA] You make a compelling
argument, but I don't--

01:15:40.382 --> 01:15:42.814
Don't tell me you've
given the candle away.

01:15:46.015 --> 01:15:50.038
This is the candle,
isn't it'! Splendid.

01:15:50.215 --> 01:15:52.215
Then we're in agreement?

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.348
[BEA] Lady Camdon,
I don't think--

01:15:53.349 --> 01:15:59.315
[EDWARD]Yes, we'll give
the candle to David.

01:15:59.315 --> 01:16:00.678
Good.

01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:06.408
[LADY CAMDON] Lord knows,
he could use a little light.

01:16:09.748 --> 01:16:13.078
But he doesn't
even believe in the candle.

01:16:18.514 --> 01:16:19.537
Edward.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.243
Edward, please!

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:36.880
Mr. Haddington.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.903
May I have a word'!

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:48.309
The Christmas Candle.

01:16:49.413 --> 01:16:51.813
You're giving the candle to me?

01:16:51.814 --> 01:16:55.802
[EDWARD]Well, you
weren't the first choice.

01:17:01.679 --> 01:17:03.509
What am I to do with it.

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:07.668
Just light it and...
just light it.

01:17:08.913 --> 01:17:13.368
Just do something
good for Gladbury.

01:17:40.578 --> 01:17:42.306
[DAVID]
Emily.

01:17:51.311 --> 01:17:52.834
[DAVID]
In church.

01:17:53.144 --> 01:17:55.235
And on your own accord.

01:17:55.411 --> 01:17:57.172
It's true.

01:17:58.378 --> 01:18:01.344
Am I to think that
you've come to believe?

01:18:01.712 --> 01:18:03.507
I don't know.

01:18:04.044 --> 01:18:05.839
I want to.

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:09.210
In times like this,
it would be comforting.

01:18:09.211 --> 01:18:11.336
Don't think less of me.

01:18:13.677 --> 01:18:15.404
I have a problem.

01:18:17.344 --> 01:18:20.177
Cousin Charlie was given
this blasted Christmas Candle,

01:18:20.177 --> 01:18:24.701
and the poor boy
has given it to me.

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:28.477
Who could refuse
a gift like that?

01:18:28.477 --> 01:18:30.477
Now all I can do is pray.

01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:33.909
I feel as though
I owe it to him.

01:18:38.077 --> 01:18:40.009
That is a problem.

01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:41.810
[banging on door]

01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:43.742
[EDWARD]
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

01:18:47.043 --> 01:18:49.176
Reverend Richmond, Miss Barstow.

01:18:49.177 --> 01:18:51.043
[DAVID]
Mr. Haddington, a word.

01:18:51.043 --> 01:18:52.242
Reverend!

01:18:52.242 --> 01:18:54.299
Miss Barstow!

01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:55.576
Is there a problem?

01:18:55.576 --> 01:18:58.475
[DAVID] On the contrary.
A great and wondrous miracle

01:18:58.476 --> 01:19:00.567
has taken place this
Christmas season.

01:19:01.309 --> 01:19:05.242
It seems that the angel
has blessed not one,

01:19:05.242 --> 01:19:08.242
but two Christmas
Candles this year.

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:11.508
And now that I think of it,
how small is my faith,

01:19:11.509 --> 01:19:14.242
to think that this angel
might stop at two.

01:19:14.242 --> 01:19:16.174
Why not three or four?

01:19:16.343 --> 01:19:18.209
Or maybe there are no
limits to the blessings

01:19:18.209 --> 01:19:20.408
the Good Lord might
bestow upon Gladbury.

01:19:20.408 --> 01:19:21.674
[BEA]
Well, we can explain.

01:19:21.675 --> 01:19:23.008
Edward tripped, and then--

01:19:23.009 --> 01:19:24.009
you came around.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:24.908
There was an accident.

01:19:24.909 --> 01:19:26.541
Yes, we'd lost the candle.

01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.074
So I said, "Why don't we
give all the candles?"

01:19:28.075 --> 01:19:28.909
Bea.

01:19:28.909 --> 01:19:29.708
And Edward said--

01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:30.975
We meant no harm.

01:19:30.976 --> 01:19:32.669
But you've given us false hope.

01:19:32.875 --> 01:19:35.136
Surely you can see that.

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:41.369
How could you?

01:19:41.874 --> 01:19:44.874
How could you question my
intentions for the people of

01:19:44.874 --> 01:19:48.307
Gladbury when you, yourselves
so blatantly misled them?

01:19:48.308 --> 01:19:50.674
I fear this Christmas will end
in nothing but disappointment,

01:19:50.674 --> 01:19:52.807
And you and your fairy
tales are to blame.

01:19:52.808 --> 01:19:54.001
[Bea gasps]

01:19:56.708 --> 01:19:59.970
Perhaps it was providence
that kept me in Gladbury.

01:20:02.307 --> 01:20:07.873
<i>â™ª</i>

01:20:07.873 --> 01:20:09.873
Well, here we are again.

01:20:09.873 --> 01:20:11.964
[DAVID]
Thank you, Mrs. Hopewell.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:14.163
I can never repay you.

01:20:23.974 --> 01:20:27.202
I know what it is
to suffer a great loss.

01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:35.169
Allow me, Reverend.

01:20:51.739 --> 01:20:53.399
It's time.

01:20:56.706 --> 01:21:02.006
On Christmas Eve, we light
the final candle of Advent,

01:21:02.006 --> 01:21:07.739
the Christ Candle, for only
in Christ do we find the hope,

01:21:07.739 --> 01:21:13.638
love, joy, and peace that we
have come to know this season.

01:21:15.238 --> 01:21:18.670
Christmas Eve
holds a special place

01:21:18.671 --> 01:21:21.671
in the heart of every believer,

01:21:21.671 --> 01:21:26.831
and nowhere is this more true
than in the town of Gladbury.

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:34.204
Many of you have no
doubt come to rejoice

01:21:34.204 --> 01:21:36.830
in the miracle of the
Christmas Candle.

01:21:38.204 --> 01:21:41.704
But regretfully,
tonight you shall see this

01:21:41.705 --> 01:21:45.864
long-standing tradition
come to an end.

01:21:46.071 --> 01:21:49.162
[gasps]

01:22:09.503 --> 01:22:11.492
Father?

01:22:14.236 --> 01:22:16.836
I would now like to ask
the recipient of the

01:22:16.836 --> 01:22:21.030
Christmas Candle
to please stand.

01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:27.298
[murmurs]

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:30.636
[DAVID] Now more than
ever I see the urgent need

01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:33.136
to speak on the virtue
of enduring faith,

01:22:33.136 --> 01:22:34.169
a faith that endures

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:36.869
disappointment, and
unanswered prayer.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:40.368
A faith that relies not on
the hollow promises of men,

01:22:40.369 --> 01:22:43.062
but on the sovereignty
of Almighty God.

01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:45.700
<i>I...</i>

01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:49.797
<i>I...</i>

01:22:49.969 --> 01:22:51.569
I've got something to say!

01:22:51.569 --> 01:22:53.830
[gasps and chatter]

01:23:02.568 --> 01:23:04.035
I can speak!

01:23:04.035 --> 01:23:05.868
[joyful voices]

01:23:05.868 --> 01:23:08.467
I prayed. Every day I prayed,

01:23:08.468 --> 01:23:11.668
And then I woke up this
morning, and I could talk.

01:23:11.668 --> 01:23:14.725
I don't understand it.
I even gave my candle away.

01:23:15.635 --> 01:23:18.067
But my favorite scripture says,

01:23:18.068 --> 01:23:20.835
"With God,
all things are possible."

01:23:20.835 --> 01:23:25.062
Now I'm never going to stop
talking, especially about this!

01:23:25.335 --> 01:23:27.892
[applause]

01:23:30.468 --> 01:23:32.334
I don't know how this happened,

01:23:32.335 --> 01:23:35.734
but my wife also received
the Christmas Candle.

01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:37.067
For my husband.

01:23:37.068 --> 01:23:40.397
As many of you know,
I was stuck on the bottle.

01:23:40.667 --> 01:23:43.000
Like never before, I prayed.

01:23:43.001 --> 01:23:45.700
And I found I was
drinking less and less.

01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:47.792
Which really is a miracle.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:51.700
[applause]

01:23:51.701 --> 01:23:53.500
I was hopeless.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.489
I'd lost everything.

01:23:56.967 --> 01:24:00.365
And now, nothing': lost at all.

01:24:00.633 --> 01:24:03.532
It's all been found.

01:24:03.533 --> 01:24:05.658
[applause]

01:24:06.566 --> 01:24:09.133
[MR. FINCH] I've been out
of a job for some time now,

01:24:09.133 --> 01:24:11.732
and found myself
in debt up to my ears.

01:24:11.733 --> 01:24:13.166
But then, our landlady--

01:24:13.167 --> 01:24:15.466
[MRS. FINCH] She forgave
us our debts in full.

01:24:15.466 --> 01:24:17.199
[MR. FINCH] And if
that wasn't enough,

01:24:17.199 --> 01:24:19.399
well I found work
at the Leonard house.

01:24:19.399 --> 01:24:22.332
It makes a man feel good to
provide for his family again.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:26.166
And my wife, she's found
a good friend in Ms. Leonard.

01:24:26.166 --> 01:24:27.399
[MRS. FINCH]
Yes, this dear woman,

01:24:27.399 --> 01:24:29.232
she's taught our kids to knit.

01:24:29.232 --> 01:24:30.965
[laughs and applause]

01:24:30.966 --> 01:24:32.399
[JOE] [on verge of tears]
My name's Joe.

01:24:32.399 --> 01:24:34.065
I'm not really a religious man.

01:24:34.066 --> 01:24:38.828
I asked for the candle,
and it's saved my cat.

01:24:39.532 --> 01:24:43.226
It may not seem much, but
she means a great deal to me.

01:24:43.865 --> 01:24:46.331
I never thought I'd get
the Christmas Candle,

01:24:46.332 --> 01:24:47.732
but thank God I did.

01:24:47.732 --> 01:24:50.298
[applause]

01:24:50.298 --> 01:24:54.064
[PHINEAS]The candle was
for me old man, Oliver Barber.

01:24:54.065 --> 01:24:54.964
[DELILAH]
He was blind.

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:58.954
As you may have heard,
dad died this morning.

01:24:59.699 --> 01:25:02.365
[DELILAH] And just before
he left us, he whispered,

01:25:02.365 --> 01:25:03.631
"I can see."

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:08.198
"I can see." His prayer was
answered,just as he'd hoped.

01:25:08.198 --> 01:25:10.720
He saw Jesus.

01:25:15.831 --> 01:25:17.997
When I received the candle,

01:25:17.998 --> 01:25:20.731
I thought my prayer'd
be answered one way,

01:25:20.731 --> 01:25:23.330
so I took a step of faith.

01:25:23.331 --> 01:25:26.320
Only it was in
the wrong direction.

01:25:26.531 --> 01:25:29.797
But then I stumbled into
the arms of Hardy Collins,

01:25:29.798 --> 01:25:32.130
the man of my dreams,

01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:34.963
and just this morning,
he asked me to be his wife.

01:25:34.964 --> 01:25:36.331
[excited gasps]

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:39.297
My answer's yes!

01:25:40.964 --> 01:25:43.830
[EMILY]
I don't know what to say,

01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:50.228
except I prayed for
my father, and here he is.

01:25:53.463 --> 01:25:56.729
[WOMAN] I hadn't spoke
to my sister in ten years.

01:25:56.730 --> 01:25:59.830
I even stopped coming
to church because of her.

01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:01.529
But we both
received the candle...

01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:06.729
So Reverend, have you changed
your mind about Gladbury?

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:10.127
I'm afraid this has only
confirmed my suspicions.

01:26:10.363 --> 01:26:12.658
How can you not believe?

01:26:13.196 --> 01:26:18.562
I believe...
but I do not belong.

01:26:18.562 --> 01:26:20.062
[thunder]

01:26:20.063 --> 01:26:22.392
[applause]

01:26:27.462 --> 01:26:29.223
Quite a night.

01:26:30.028 --> 01:26:32.460
More than I could have imagined.

01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:37.186
I know he'll come back, Edward.

01:26:37.828 --> 01:26:43.455
Not tonight. Maybe not until
after we've both gone,

01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:46.395
but I don't have
to see it to believe

01:26:46.395 --> 01:26:49.554
that our son will
come home again.

01:26:52.995 --> 01:26:54.984
[thunder]

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:58.389
[DAVID] God help
me in my unbelief.

01:27:09.794 --> 01:27:13.192
[thunder and wind]

01:27:25.994 --> 01:27:30.693
[ELEANOR] There are
miracles all around, â™ª

01:27:30.694 --> 01:27:34.393
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

01:27:34.393 --> 01:27:40.359
â™ª Hid in every heart is
an answered prayer. â™ª

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.693
[DAVID JOINS]
â™ª Like a candle': flame, â™ª

01:27:42.694 --> 01:27:46.648
â™ª Hope will lead us there. â™ª

01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:49.992
[DAVID]
â™ª When the darkness comes, â™ª

01:27:49.993 --> 01:27:52.859
â™ª Let the light shine through, â™ª

01:27:52.859 --> 01:27:58.558
â™ª A spark of faith
will ignite in you. â™ª

01:27:58.559 --> 01:28:03.692
â™ª In a candle': glow,
a Virgin's womb, â™ª

01:28:03.693 --> 01:28:10.319
â™ª In a simple prayer
in the empty tomb. â™ª

01:28:11.192 --> 01:28:16.659
[BOTH] There are
miracles all around. â™ª

01:28:16.659 --> 01:28:20.158
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

01:28:20.159 --> 01:28:26.325
â™ª Hid in every heart
is an answered prayer. â™ª

01:28:26.326 --> 01:28:32.224
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

01:28:38.358 --> 01:28:40.688
[door opens]

01:28:41.625 --> 01:28:42.818
Abner!

01:28:43.158 --> 01:28:45.991
It's Ruth!There's
been an accident,

01:28:45.991 --> 01:28:47.291
The carriage overturned.

01:28:47.291 --> 01:28:48.357
We've got to hurry.

01:28:48.358 --> 01:28:50.290
She's about to have the baby.

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.890
[DAVID]Where is she'!
ls she alright?

01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:54.291
[ABNER] About a mile away.
She needs a doctor.

01:28:54.291 --> 01:28:56.654
[DAVID] We can take
Miss Barstow': cart.

01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:58.484
[EMILY] Come on, boy, come on!

01:29:01.624 --> 01:29:03.056
[DAVID]
Come on!

01:29:14.123 --> 01:29:16.356
[DAVID] Abner, are you sure
that this is the way'!

01:29:16.357 --> 01:29:18.380
[ABNER]
Straight on, keep going.

01:29:19.524 --> 01:29:22.490
[DAVID]
Whoa! Whoa!

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.123
[DAVID]
How much further is it?

01:29:32.123 --> 01:29:34.555
[ABNER] Just round the bend,
where the road drops off.

01:29:34.556 --> 01:29:37.222
[EMILY] I'll come with you.
I know these woods.

01:29:37.222 --> 01:29:39.688
[ABNER] I'll be
ready with the horse.

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.356
[DAVID] Have we
made a wrong turn?

01:29:57.356 --> 01:30:00.955
[EMILY] I don't think so,
there should be a clearing.

01:30:00.956 --> 01:30:03.320
[DAVID] How will
we ever find her?

01:30:14.789 --> 01:30:17.186
[EMILY] That won't do us
any good, not in this.

01:30:19.155 --> 01:30:21.678
[DAVID] It's one of the
Haddington candles.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:29.610
[EMILY]
I have three left.

01:30:36.021 --> 01:30:37.816
[DAVID]
Try again.

01:30:50.854 --> 01:30:56.886
[DAVID]Wait! Please,
God, keep Ruth safe.

01:30:56.887 --> 01:30:59.285
Help us find her.

01:31:02.954 --> 01:31:04.886
[DAVID]
Try again.

01:31:05.620 --> 01:31:12.042
Please, God.We need a miracle.

01:31:20.019 --> 01:31:21.849
[EMILY]
What's happening?

01:31:24.986 --> 01:31:27.316
[DAVID]
A miracle is happening.

01:31:31.286 --> 01:31:32.377
[DAVID]
Let's go.

01:31:37.485 --> 01:31:39.281
[DAVID]
Let's go.

01:31:53.852 --> 01:31:55.374
[DAVID]
Ruth!

01:31:55.686 --> 01:31:58.686
Ruth! Thank God we found you.

01:31:58.686 --> 01:32:00.447
[RUTH]
Mr. Richmond.

01:32:01.686 --> 01:32:03.651
You're safe now.

01:32:12.618 --> 01:32:14.846
[baby cries]

01:32:16.152 --> 01:32:18.185
[CHARLIE]
Faster, Uncle, faster!

01:32:18.185 --> 01:32:19.684
[DAVID]
Dear Lady Camdon,

01:32:19.685 --> 01:32:20.785
[WILLIAM]
Charlie...

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:23.951
[DAVID] Every minister aspires
to leave his mark on a parish,

01:32:23.952 --> 01:32:28.518
but truth be told, Gladbury
has left its mark on me.

01:32:28.518 --> 01:32:30.618
In spite of my best efforts,

01:32:30.618 --> 01:32:33.950
I witnessed many miracles
this Advent season.

01:32:33.951 --> 01:32:36.815
None more remarkable than
my own change of heart.

01:32:37.484 --> 01:32:41.649
If you will have me, I will be
honored to remain in Gladbury,

01:32:41.650 --> 01:32:43.350
for many Christmases to come.

01:32:43.351 --> 01:32:44.384
[DAVID] [to couple]
Congratulations.

01:32:44.384 --> 01:32:47.838
[DAVID]Your miracle man,
David Richmond.

01:32:49.051 --> 01:32:52.108
Ah, the Reverend Richmond.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.216
Happy Christmas.

01:32:54.216 --> 01:32:56.307
Happy Christmas to you.

01:32:57.383 --> 01:32:59.549
I don't quite know what to say,

01:32:59.550 --> 01:33:02.016
except for there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

01:33:02.016 --> 01:33:03.845
[ELEANOR]
Let me take that.

01:33:05.849 --> 01:33:08.149
[BEA] But you knew
about this all along?

01:33:08.150 --> 01:33:10.383
I had an inkling, but I didn't
know for sure until

01:33:10.383 --> 01:33:13.315
Ruth confirmed
Thomas was the father.

01:33:23.816 --> 01:33:25.509
Are you ready?

01:33:27.849 --> 01:33:30.679
[DAVID] Come,
meet your grandchild.

01:33:31.816 --> 01:33:37.839
Ruth, this is Mr. and Mrs.
Haddington,Thomas' parents.

01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:40.172
I hardly know what to say.

01:33:46.548 --> 01:33:48.776
He has your eyes.

01:33:49.381 --> 01:33:51.347
Have you named him?

01:33:51.648 --> 01:33:54.341
I'd like to name
him after my father.

01:33:54.782 --> 01:33:56.873
He looks like an Edward.

01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:00.606
Isn't that a fine name?

01:34:01.281 --> 01:34:02.770
May I?

01:34:12.681 --> 01:34:14.477
[BEA]
Our grandson.

01:34:20.114 --> 01:34:21.841
Edward.

01:34:36.814 --> 01:34:38.177
[DAVID]
Emily!

01:34:42.947 --> 01:34:44.470
I was hoping, uh...

01:34:47.113 --> 01:34:48.840
Yes;

01:34:50.314 --> 01:34:53.473
I was hoping that we might
spend Christmas together.

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:57.368
Your first
Christmas in Gladbury.

01:34:58.147 --> 01:34:59.874
And your last.

01:35:01.047 --> 01:35:04.013
Gladbury has a funny
way of keeping people.

01:35:04.513 --> 01:35:08.673
I used to mind it.
I don't anymore.

01:35:22.212 --> 01:35:26.974
Forgive me.The moment
seemed providential.

01:35:35.312 --> 01:35:36.645
[DAVID] Does this mean
I'll be seeing you

01:35:36.645 --> 01:35:38.378
in church from now on?

01:35:38.378 --> 01:35:40.537
[Emily chuckles]

01:35:43.478 --> 01:35:49.144
â™ª On a starry night
in Bethlehem, â™ª

01:35:49.145 --> 01:35:54.478
â™ª A child was born
to bring light to men. â™ª

01:35:54.478 --> 01:35:59.810
<i>And our faith waned, our eyes grew dim </i>

01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:06.108
â™ª In a candle': light
we found hope again. â™ª

01:36:07.477 --> 01:36:13.677
There are miracles
all around, â™ª

01:36:13.678 --> 01:36:17.610
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

01:36:17.777 --> 01:36:25.676
â™ª Hid in every heart is
an answered prayer. â™ª

01:36:26.044 --> 01:36:32.840
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

01:36:40.843 --> 01:36:46.542
â™ª When the darkness comes,
let the light shine through, â™ª

01:36:46.543 --> 01:36:51.775
â™ª A spark of faith
will ignite in you. â™ª

01:36:51.776 --> 01:36:57.109
â™ª In a candle': glow,
a Virgin's womb, â™ª

01:36:57.109 --> 01:37:03.439
â™ª In a simple prayer,
in the empty tomb. â™ª

01:37:03.609 --> 01:37:09.609
There are miracles
all around, â™ª

01:37:09.609 --> 01:37:13.675
â™ª Miracles yet to be found. â™ª

01:37:13.676 --> 01:37:20.972
â™ª Hid in every heart
is an answered prayer. â™ª

01:37:22.108 --> 01:37:28.597
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª

01:37:28.808 --> 01:37:34.541
When the light has
dawned on Christmas day, â™ª

01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:39.607
We will lift our
voice in endless praise. â™ª

01:37:39.608 --> 01:37:44.941
When the light has
dawned on Christmas day, â™ª

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:49.374
[we will say: â™ª

01:37:50.041 --> 01:38:00.508
There are miracles all around,
miracles yet to be found. â™ª

01:38:00.508 --> 01:38:08.100
â™ª Hid in every heart
is an answered prayer. â™ª

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:16.767
â™ª Like a candle': flame,
hope will lead us there. â™ª
